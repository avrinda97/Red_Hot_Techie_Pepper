2007-01-21T09:31:00.000Z	n2diy	gotgenes	 take a look in /lib/share/doc/grep
2007-01-21T09:32:00.000Z	gotgenes	n2diy	no /lib/share or /usr/lib/share
2007-01-21T09:32:00.000Z	n2diy	gotgenes	 whoops take a look in /usr/share/doc/grep
2007-01-21T09:33:00.000Z	gotgenes	n2diy	still absent from there
2007-01-21T09:34:00.000Z	n2diy	gotgenes	ok, try locate grep, and see if any docs turn up.
2007-01-21T09:36:00.000Z	gotgenes	n2diy	no info pages when doing a $ locate grep | grep info
2007-01-21T09:36:00.000Z	n2diy	gotgenes	hmm, I have them here on Dapper, are you using Edgy?
2007-01-21T09:36:00.000Z	gotgenes	n2diy	yes, Edgy
2007-01-21T09:37:00.000Z	n2diy	gotgenes	Ok, now I have another reason not to "upgrade."
2007-01-21T09:43:00.000Z	gotgenes	n2diy	I don't see the info file in the Dapper listings http://tinyurl.com/2r9dk9
2007-01-21T09:44:00.000Z	n2diy	gotgenes	I wasn't looking for anything in particular, I just did a locate grep, and saw the doc directory.
2007-01-21T09:44:00.000Z	gotgenes	n2diy	what does "info grep" give?
2007-01-21T09:44:00.000Z	gotgenes	n2diy	if it says "Manpages" at the top, there's no info in Dapper, too
2007-01-21T09:45:00.000Z	n2diy	gotgenes	A doc titled File man pages, node grep.
2007-01-21T09:46:00.000Z	gotgenes	n2diy	looks like the info pages for grep aren't on Dapper either. Strange
2007-01-21T09:46:00.000Z	n2diy	gotgenes	ok, sorry for the wild goose chase.
2007-01-21T09:47:00.000Z	gotgenes	n2diy	np, but now to find where the heck they went
2007-01-21T10:00:00.000Z	gotgenes	n2diy	psYchotic: http://tinyurl.com/2r3v2f The info pages are under a non-free license (GFDL) and can't be included in the packages anymore :-( Now we know what happened
2007-01-21T10:01:00.000Z	n2diy	gotgenes	well, that explains it.
