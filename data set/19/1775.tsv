2010-10-14T20:25:00.000Z	lou1234		I tried install the big-si themes and apparently the eco them is broke
2010-10-14T20:25:00.000Z	jrib	lou1234	define "bad package"
2010-10-14T20:27:00.000Z	jrib	lou1234	stop using enter to break up your thoughts and pastebin what is actually going on in the terminal
2010-10-14T20:29:00.000Z	lou1234	jrib	http://paste.ubuntu.com/513193/
2010-10-14T20:29:00.000Z	jrib	lou1234	I need full output and your input
2010-10-14T20:31:00.000Z	lou1234	jrib	http://paste.ubuntu.com/513194/
2010-10-14T20:32:00.000Z	jrib	lou1234	how come this doesn't include the output you pastebinned before?
2010-10-14T20:35:00.000Z	lou1234	jrib	would you like me to try anything else?
2010-10-14T20:35:00.000Z	jrib	lou1234	what do you want to do now?  Just remove it?
2010-10-14T20:35:00.000Z	lou1234	jrib	that would be wonderful!
2010-10-14T20:36:00.000Z	jrib	lou1234	what happens when you try? (dpkg -r)
2010-10-14T20:37:00.000Z	lou1234	jrib	pm?
2010-10-14T20:38:00.000Z	jrib	lou1234	better here
2010-10-14T20:42:00.000Z	lou1234	jrib	would you prefer that output in a paste?
2010-10-14T20:42:00.000Z	jrib	lou1234	sure
2010-10-14T20:45:00.000Z	lou1234	jrib	http://paste.ubuntu.com/513217/
2010-10-14T20:47:00.000Z	jrib	lou1234	one way to remove it would be to do "dpkg --purge --force-remove-reinstreq packagename", otherwise you need to figure out why the package is not installing correctly and sort that out
2010-10-14T21:03:00.000Z	lou1234	jrib	that helped out a ton.. thank you very much!!
