2011-04-30T19:44:00.000Z	muneeb		hi..  i'm having problem with minimize maximize buttons.. they don't glow when i hover over them.. any help??
2011-04-30T19:44:00.000Z	Stereocaulon_	muneeb	which GPU do you have?
2011-04-30T19:46:00.000Z	muneeb	Stereocaulon_	 ATI Readon
2011-04-30T19:46:00.000Z	muneeb	Stereocaulon_	 i think it's ATI 4200
2011-04-30T19:48:00.000Z	muneeb	Stereocaulon_	 i switched to classic when Unity didnt work.. resetting unity was taking lot of time so i switched to classic
2011-04-30T19:49:00.000Z	Stereocaulon_	muneeb	the fact that Unity does not work, means that you are using GPU drivers which are not optimal for your GPU
2011-04-30T19:50:00.000Z	Stereocaulon_	muneeb	I'm also on Classic BTW, but with an nVidia 9600 LT
2011-04-30T19:50:00.000Z	muneeb	Stereocaulon_	 Unity did work but i screwed it up... and it's not getting reset
2011-04-30T19:51:00.000Z	Stereocaulon_	muneeb	ah, I switched from Unity back to classic after a first glimpse at Unity.
2011-04-30T19:53:00.000Z	muneeb	Stereocaulon_	well unity wasnt working until i installed proprietary  drivers then it worked then i played in compiz and all got screwed.. so i'm trying to reset it and it's not working :( even classic got screwed :(
2011-04-30T19:54:00.000Z	Stereocaulon_	muneeb	check the answers that oneliner__ will get as they could help you.
2011-04-30T19:54:00.000Z	Stereocaulon_	muneeb	please try the following to restore unity: sudo dpg-reconfigure unity
2011-04-30T19:54:00.000Z	Stereocaulon_	muneeb	Correction, please try the following to restore unity: sudo dpkg-reconfigure unity
2011-04-30T19:55:00.000Z	muneeb	Stereocaulon_	ok.. i'll try it
2011-04-30T20:00:00.000Z	muneeb	Stereocaulon_	 whoa!!! that did the trick.. i was struggling for it since morning.. sudo dpkg-reconfigure unity... thanks a lot
2011-04-30T20:01:00.000Z	muneeb	Stereocaulon_	now the min max button also started glowing when i hover!!
2011-04-30T20:01:00.000Z	Stereocaulon_	muneeb	sudo dpkg-reconfigure <package> works for a lot of packages if you run into troubles with them. That's how I fixed my initially failed upgrade from 10.10. Glad to be able to help you :-)
2011-04-30T20:03:00.000Z	muneeb	Stereocaulon_	well i had tried sudo dpkg --configure -a but i didnt help... i learned a new command today dpkg-reconfigure!!
2011-04-30T20:05:00.000Z	Stereocaulon_	muneeb	I just learned it from a book teaching me LPIC level 1
