2006-10-30T13:55:00.000Z	Green_Mage		Hello, I'm new to Linux and I'm having trouble installing the Lan driver.  I tried following the instructions provided with the driver -> unzip the tar.gz, goto the folder it was extracted to, type ./install.sh in the terminal.  Doing so returned a "Permission Denied" error.  Typing "sudo ./install.sh" returned a "command not found" error.  Any help would be greatly appreciated!
2006-10-30T13:56:00.000Z	timfrost	Green_Mage	what does the first line of the file look like?
2006-10-30T13:56:00.000Z	Green_Mage		install.sh?
2006-10-30T13:56:00.000Z	timfrost	Green_Mage	yes
2006-10-30T13:58:00.000Z	timfrost	Green_Mage	if it is a shell script, it should have something like '#!/bin/sh' or '#!/bin/bash'
2006-10-30T13:58:00.000Z	Green_Mage		The first non-comment line is this: function message_status ()
2006-10-30T13:58:00.000Z	Green_Mage		Oh
2006-10-30T13:58:00.000Z	Green_Mage		Here
2006-10-30T13:58:00.000Z	Green_Mage		#!/bin/sh
2006-10-30T14:00:00.000Z	timfrost	Green_Mage	That first line looks OK. what driver software is it? Where did you get it from?
2006-10-30T14:00:00.000Z	Green_Mage		Tim: It's a driver for my onboard LAN, I got it from my mobo CD's linux driver directory
2006-10-30T14:01:00.000Z	Green_Mage	timfrost	It's a driver for my onboard LAN, I got it from my mobo CD's linux driver directory
2006-10-30T14:02:00.000Z	timfrost	Green_Mage	the error you got suggests that the script is trying to run a non-existent program.  What happens if you do 'sudo sh -x ./install.sh'?
2006-10-30T14:03:00.000Z	Green_Mage	timfrost	couldn't tell you - I can't connect from Ubuntu to the internet, so I'm using WinXP right now.
2006-10-30T14:03:00.000Z	Green_Mage	timfrost	I'd have to reboot to check
2006-10-30T14:04:00.000Z	timfrost	Green_Mage	I am about to drop out, so won't be able to help any more.
2006-10-30T14:05:00.000Z	Green_Mage	timfrost	any suggestions before you go?
2006-10-30T14:05:00.000Z	timfrost	Green_Mage	no
2006-10-30T14:05:00.000Z	Green_Mage	timfrost	ok, thanks for your time, tim
