2005-06-13T07:31:00.000Z	makoto		didnt mean to do that
2005-06-13T07:32:00.000Z	bob2	makoto	so, line 1 of that file is wrong
2005-06-13T07:32:00.000Z	makoto	bob2	: the install bit?
2005-06-13T07:33:00.000Z	bob2	makoto	I don't know, only you can see that file at the moment
2005-06-13T08:24:00.000Z	bob2	makoto	they are both available if you have multiverse enabled
2005-06-13T08:29:00.000Z	bob2	makoto	totem-xine.
2005-06-13T08:29:00.000Z	bob2	makoto	ubuntu-desktop will not be removed by install totem-gstreamer, but it will have been removed when you install totem-xine
2005-06-13T08:31:00.000Z	bob2	makoto	ok, I'm wrong, you can install totem-xine or totem-gstreamer along with ubuntu-desktop
2005-06-13T08:32:00.000Z	bob2	makoto	what cpu do you have?
2005-06-13T08:32:00.000Z	bob2	makoto	then mplayer-686
