2010-07-03T06:47:00.000Z	Scunizi	soreau	wodka has issues with the computer simply stopping all processes until a key is pressed or the mouse is moved.
2010-07-03T06:48:00.000Z	soreau	Scunizi	So the first thing to try is the vesa driver, which is already installed as well
2010-07-03T06:48:00.000Z	soreau	Scunizi	This would tell whether the problem is with the graphics driver or not
2010-07-03T06:49:00.000Z	Scunizi	soreau	let wodKa know.. I've gotta run.. the idea was to verify that the current driver worked on his particular card.. not to replace the driver.

2011-04-16T06:10:00.000Z	soreau	Scunizi	No, I want a non-manual way of doing it
2011-04-16T06:10:00.000Z	Scunizi	soreau	yea.. that's a tough one
2011-04-16T07:49:00.000Z	soreau	Scunizi	Alright, you want to see this mega one-liner?
