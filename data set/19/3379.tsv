2011-05-31T19:27:00.000Z	DynamicFail		How can I change the permissions on a single program to run with root privlages
2011-05-31T19:27:00.000Z	edbian_	DynamicFail	What program is it?  Why does it need to run as root?
2011-05-31T19:28:00.000Z	edbian_	DynamicFail	You could use setUID or just sudo
2011-05-31T19:29:00.000Z	edbian_	DynamicFail	Make the owner root and turn on the setUID bit.  Does that make sense?
2011-05-31T19:29:00.000Z	DynamicFail	edbian_	I'm not sure how to do that
2011-05-31T19:29:00.000Z	edbian_	DynamicFail	Which part?
2011-05-31T19:29:00.000Z	DynamicFail	edbian_	both
2011-05-31T19:31:00.000Z	edbian_	DynamicFail	to set the file as root:  sudo chown root /path/to/file
2011-05-31T19:33:00.000Z	edbian_	DynamicFail	got that much?
2011-05-31T19:33:00.000Z	DynamicFail	edbian_	yep
2011-05-31T19:34:00.000Z	edbian_	DynamicFail	beli is advising we use sudo.  The difference is that if we use setUID any user will be allowed to run your program.  If we make people use sudo to run it only sudoers can run it.  It is your call.  Technically sudo is a more secure alternative
2011-05-31T19:35:00.000Z	DynamicFail	edbian_	I want anyone to be able to run this program
2011-05-31T19:35:00.000Z	edbian_	DynamicFail	then sudo chmod 4744 /path/to/file
2011-05-31T19:35:00.000Z	DynamicFail	edbian_	Thanks!
2011-05-31T19:36:00.000Z	edbian_	DynamicFail	Test it, does it work?
2011-05-31T19:36:00.000Z	edbian_	DynamicFail	I think it might need to be 4755   (allowing others to execute) it's kinda tricky with setUID on
2011-05-31T19:39:00.000Z	edbian_	DynamicFail	Is it even working?
2011-05-31T19:39:00.000Z	DynamicFail	edbian_	trying it :)
2011-05-31T19:41:00.000Z	edbian_	DynamicFail	see what beli said?  he is correct
