2008-01-16T22:54:00.000Z	WorkingOnWise		can someone tell me why my xorg.conf looks like this?  http://pastebin.ca/857448
2008-01-16T22:55:00.000Z	silent	WorkingOnWise	just do a dpkg-reconfigure
2008-01-16T22:55:00.000Z	silent	WorkingOnWise	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2008-01-16T22:56:00.000Z	WorkingOnWise	silent	I did, and with --phigh. I have also cleared the file totally, and reran both. same thing
2008-01-16T22:56:00.000Z	silent	WorkingOnWise	what's wrong with it?
2008-01-16T22:58:00.000Z	silent	WorkingOnWise	does your monitor and mouse work?
2008-01-16T22:58:00.000Z	WorkingOnWise	silent	it does, but not near as well as it has in the past
2008-01-16T22:58:00.000Z	silent	WorkingOnWise	what do you mean? the monitor/mouse only work one way
2008-01-16T23:00:00.000Z	WorkingOnWise	silent	I should be able to coifigure my xserver and I can't, save for the keyboard. I want to chance video drivers to see if I can fix the black window problem I have.
2008-01-16T23:00:00.000Z	silent	WorkingOnWise	add the driver option to xorg
2008-01-16T23:02:00.000Z	silent	WorkingOnWise	http://pastebin.ca/857481
2008-01-16T23:04:00.000Z	WorkingOnWise	silent	I think I have a bigger problem that that. I shouldn't need to do that ever, unless I have some unsupported video, right? I have Nvidia GeForce Go 6100
2008-01-16T23:06:00.000Z	silent	WorkingOnWise	you never know what you should or shouldn't do... everything is conditional. Try installing nvidia-glx for that card
2008-01-16T23:06:00.000Z	WorkingOnWise	silent	it's installed.
2008-01-16T23:06:00.000Z	silent	WorkingOnWise	I know the linux installer for nvidia reconfigures xorg appropriately
2008-01-16T23:06:00.000Z	silent	WorkingOnWise	check to see if adding driver "nvidia" helps
2008-01-16T23:07:00.000Z	WorkingOnWise	silent	I'll do that. bbl ty
2008-01-16T23:32:00.000Z	WorkingOnWise	silent	no good. instead of having unknown video with full 3d support, I have unknown fideo with only 2d support.
2008-01-16T23:46:00.000Z	silent	WorkingOnWise	try the nvidia installer
