2009-07-24T05:59:00.000Z	jefinc	cooper77z	he means irc client
2009-07-24T05:59:00.000Z	jefinc	cooper77z	you're using irc to talk to us, what program did you open to do so
2009-07-24T06:02:00.000Z	jefinc	cooper77z	what is your requirement for using /whois that has made this such a dire issue?
2009-07-27T02:09:00.000Z	jefinc	cooper77z	how do you mean? the keyboard shortcut to switch between running applications?
2009-07-27T02:12:00.000Z	jefinc	cooper77z	do you mean desktop screen? with multipul desktops?
2009-07-27T02:12:00.000Z	jefinc	cooper77z	you can set that up in System -> Preferences -> keyboard shortcuts
2009-07-27T02:13:00.000Z	jefinc	cooper77z	oh, that is default as alt+tab :)
2009-07-27T02:13:00.000Z	jefinc	cooper77z	but in the keyboard shortcuts you'll find all sorts of goodies :)
2009-07-27T02:17:00.000Z	cooper77z	jefinc	that alt+tab command works really good :)
