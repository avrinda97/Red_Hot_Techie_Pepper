2010-10-28T18:55:00.000Z	george1	qnrq	i don't use ubuntu.
2010-10-28T18:52:00.000Z	george1	qnrq	the install will partition your disks
2010-10-28T18:54:00.000Z	george1	qnrq	then select manual nothing hard about it
2010-10-28T18:54:00.000Z	qnrq	george1	I did, but I can't find the LVM option anywhere under there
2010-10-28T18:55:00.000Z	qnrq	george1	it would be simple if there was an LVM option in the partition process
2010-10-28T18:55:00.000Z	qnrq	george1	the attitude is really uncalled for. if you think it's exhausting then please don't reply to my questions :-)
2010-10-28T18:55:00.000Z	george1	qnrq	lol calm down kid.
2010-10-28T18:56:00.000Z	qnrq	george1	I am calm, I just think it's a bit unreasonable to "facepalm" and rant about how "hard it could be".
2010-10-28T18:57:00.000Z	george1	qnrq	You're using ubuntu and complaining about meanial things, the distro is designed for idiots for gods sake.
2010-10-28T18:57:00.000Z	qnrq	george1	I know, I've been linuxing since Slackware was the shit on floppies. I have a laptop that I just want to have up and running with an encrypted fs. not sure why I should even need to defend myself on this subject.
2010-10-28T18:58:00.000Z	george1	qnrq	Clearly not if you can't manage ubuntu.
2010-10-28T18:59:00.000Z	qnrq	george1	who said I can't "manage ubuntu"? that I drop by the irc channel asking where the option for lvm is? in previous versions there's always been an option, in 10.10 it's missing. it's got nothing to do with "not managing ubuntu".
2010-10-28T18:59:00.000Z	george1	qnrq	Google. k.
2010-10-28T19:00:00.000Z	george1	qnrq	I found the answer to your question in seconds.
2010-10-28T19:00:00.000Z	qnrq	george1	I bet you did. are you seriously sitting in this channel for the sole purpose of ranting about a distro you dislike when people ask for help?
2010-10-28T19:01:00.000Z	george1	qnrq	I was sat in here for reasons you don't need to know, what's relevant is clearly your an idiot.
2010-10-28T19:01:00.000Z	qnrq	george1	excuse me?
2010-10-28T19:02:00.000Z	george1	qnrq	idiot
2010-10-28T19:02:00.000Z	qnrq	george1	you must've had a happy childhood :-)
