2011-02-14T14:11:00.000Z	zamba		i need a graphical ftp client in ubuntu that supports TLS
2011-02-14T14:12:00.000Z	rumpe1	zamba	nautilus?
2011-02-14T14:12:00.000Z	rumpe1	zamba	places->connection to server->ftp....
2011-02-14T14:13:00.000Z	zamba	rumpe1	and how do i establish a secure connection here?
2011-02-14T14:13:00.000Z	rumpe1	zamba	well... then ftp might be the worst choice
2011-02-14T14:13:00.000Z	zamba	rumpe1	that's what i mean by "supports TLS"
2011-02-14T14:14:00.000Z	rumpe1	zamba	connection to another linux-OS?
2011-02-14T14:15:00.000Z	zamba	rumpe1	ah, screw that.. i went for scp instead
2011-02-14T14:16:00.000Z	rumpe1	zamba	good choice

2011-02-15T14:54:00.000Z	rumpe1	zamba	 have you access to the internet-router of 192.168.0.1?
2011-02-15T14:55:00.000Z	rumpe1	zamba	you have to use the public ip of the net... not 192.168.0.1, which is a local one
2011-02-15T14:56:00.000Z	zamba	rumpe1	no, that's why i'm going through the internal machine
2011-02-15T14:56:00.000Z	zamba	rumpe1	i know this is possible with ssh
2011-02-15T14:56:00.000Z	zamba	rumpe1	and tunneling
2011-02-15T14:57:00.000Z	rumpe1	zamba	sure... tunnel to the host with the public ip or its forwarded port
2011-02-15T15:01:00.000Z	rumpe1	zamba	has 192.168.2.9 Gnome or something? then use ssh -X  (or ssh -Y) and start webbrowser on .2.9 and enter router ip
2011-02-15T15:02:00.000Z	zamba	rumpe1	no xlibs
2011-02-15T15:02:00.000Z	zamba	rumpe1	so no
