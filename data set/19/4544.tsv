2008-12-23T22:08:00.000Z	Setebos		I am not under Users and Groups for some reason. Does anyone know how to fix this? I have a home directory and applications recognize me as a user but the users and groups admin tool does not have me and the login screen does not display me.
2008-12-23T22:09:00.000Z	pdroy80	Setebos	which user and group do you mean ?
2008-12-23T22:10:00.000Z	Setebos		Sytem -> administration -> users and groups. The one thats installed by default.
2008-12-23T22:11:00.000Z	pdroy80	Setebos	if you open a terminal -> Applications -> Accessories - > Terminal and type "id"
2008-12-23T22:11:00.000Z	pdroy80		you will see what all user and groups the user belongs to

2008-12-23T22:13:00.000Z	pdroy80	Setebos	that looks good enough, though you are not there in the admin group so you might not be able to do "sudo" commands
2008-12-23T22:14:00.000Z	Setebos	pdroy80	I can do sudo commands. Everything works fine except I can't edit myself with that tool or appear on the login window.
2008-12-23T22:15:00.000Z	Setebos	pdroy80	I can edit my settings through the terminal I just want to know why I am invisable to these tools.
2008-12-23T22:15:00.000Z	pdroy80	Setebos	hmm how did you add the user ? during installation or after that ?
2008-12-23T22:16:00.000Z	Setebos	pdroy80	Before actually. I had the user and home directory already when I installed ubuntu and just went on using it from there. I had originally created it during instalation when I had ubuntu before that.
2008-12-23T22:18:00.000Z	pdroy80	Setebos	could be that some of the user specific files did not get copied, during installation, just a wild guess
2008-12-23T22:18:00.000Z	Setebos	pdroy80	I have my home directories installed in a seperate partitions for when I decide to distro hop.
2008-12-23T22:18:00.000Z	Setebos	pdroy80	Is there a way to fix this?
2008-12-23T22:19:00.000Z	pdroy80	Setebos	I had did a fix for one of ma friends, trying to figure what I had actually done
2008-12-23T22:19:00.000Z	Setebos	pdroy80	If I delete the user and then recreate it with the same directory would I still have all my files?
2008-12-23T22:20:00.000Z	pdroy80	Setebos	thats risky it is based on what command you do to delete the user
2008-12-23T22:20:00.000Z	pdroy80		man userdel
2008-12-23T22:20:00.000Z	pdroy80	Setebos	dont use -r, that would delete the home directory also
