2009-05-21T22:32:00.000Z	tones	Yankefish	chainload it in grub
2009-05-21T22:33:00.000Z	tones	Yankefish	if you are about to install ubuntu, it will automatically detect and add vista to grub
2009-05-21T22:34:00.000Z	tones	Yankefish	if not, you can just find the vista partition number and add it to your /boot/grub/menu.lst
2009-05-21T22:35:00.000Z	tones	Yankefish	vista isnt below "other operating systems"?
2009-05-21T22:35:00.000Z	tones	Yankefish	Thats not possible
2009-05-21T22:36:00.000Z	tones	Yankefish	yup
2009-05-21T22:37:00.000Z	tones	Yankefish	sorry, yup meaning it cant support loading vista direct
2009-05-21T22:39:00.000Z	tones	Yankefish	neoloader?? doesnt ring a bell... anyway if its a menu option and you dont have a clue what it is, you can delete it
2009-05-21T22:40:00.000Z	tones	Yankefish	is it commented? if it is then just leave it, its just a kind note for your sake
2009-05-27T22:51:00.000Z	tones	Yankefish	find a tool to hexedit raw drives first
2009-05-27T22:51:00.000Z	tones	Yankefish	theres a ubuntu version?? ok
2009-05-27T22:52:00.000Z	tones	Yankefish	then just change what you need to change.. eg restore a backed up header or whatever
2009-05-27T22:53:00.000Z	tones	Yankefish	youd have to be superman to be able to read the hex for the assembly code that it is, nobody will help you with that. you just need to replace the header with a backup or something
2009-05-27T22:54:00.000Z	tones	Yankefish	if the header is corrupt, and you have no backup, youre stuffed..
2009-05-27T22:55:00.000Z	tones	Yankefish	if i must
2009-05-27T22:57:00.000Z	tones	Yankefish	eh, wrong link...
2009-05-27T22:58:00.000Z	tones	Yankefish	http://forums.truecrypt.org/search.php?mode=results isnt exactly very specific
2009-05-27T23:01:00.000Z	tones	Yankefish	frankly, yes
