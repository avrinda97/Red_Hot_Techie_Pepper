2006-03-22T06:45:00.000Z	Nintendud		Alright, something fucked up has happened. Everything in /dev besides initctl and null is gone. I can't mount my cd drives because of it, and I fear that if I reboot it I won't be able to boot back in because I doubt it would be able to mount my hard drives. Anything I can do to fix this besides reinstalling?
2006-03-22T06:45:00.000Z	silvaran	Nintendud	What about /etc/init.d/udev start ?
2006-03-22T06:45:00.000Z	Nintendud		This has also caused a weird error when initializing firefox or mozilla thunderbird: ./run-mozilla.sh: line 131: 24228 Segmentation fault      "$prog" ${1+"$@"}
2006-03-22T06:46:00.000Z	Nintendud	silvaran	run that command?
2006-03-22T06:46:00.000Z	silvaran	Nintendud	I guess :)
2006-03-22T06:46:00.000Z	silvaran	Nintendud	udev is responsible for creating and removing stuff in /dev, so hey, give 'er.
2006-03-22T06:46:00.000Z	Nintendud		oh okay
2006-03-22T06:46:00.000Z	Nintendud		oh shit
2006-03-22T06:47:00.000Z	silvaran		Didn't work?
2006-03-22T06:47:00.000Z	Nintendud		no, I forgot to run it as root
2006-03-22T06:47:00.000Z	Nintendud		so I closed terminal
2006-03-22T06:47:00.000Z	Nintendud		and now I can't open another terminal
2006-03-22T06:47:00.000Z	silvaran	Nintendud	And now gnome-terminal won't start? ;) ...
2006-03-22T06:47:00.000Z	Nintendud		they error out
2006-03-22T06:47:00.000Z	silvaran	Nintendud	Ctrl+Alt+F1
2006-03-22T06:47:00.000Z	Nintendud	silvaran	aterm and gnome-terminal
2006-03-22T06:48:00.000Z	silvaran	Nintendud	Or Alt+F2, then "xterm" .. that one might still run ... Alt+F7 to get back to X if you did the Ctrl+Alt+F1 idea.
2006-03-22T06:50:00.000Z	silvaran		Wow... I think Nintendud hit Ctrl+Alt+F1 before I could tell him about Alt+F7 :(
2006-03-22T06:55:00.000Z	Nintendud	silvaran	haha, didn't work, it just restarted my computer.. but restarting fixed it
