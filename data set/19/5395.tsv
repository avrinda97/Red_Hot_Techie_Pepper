2008-07-10T06:27:00.000Z	pdg1	Drk_Guy	gXiso is not on the repos...
2008-07-10T06:28:00.000Z	Drk_Guy	pdg1	then compile it off, refer to the project's wiki for dependancies and -dev packages for compiling
2008-07-10T06:29:00.000Z	Drk_Guy	pdg1	If they do not metion -dev packages, only install dependancies with -dev endings ;O)
2008-07-10T06:30:00.000Z	pdg1		okay... I'm going to assume that there's some super documenting in the Ubuntu wiki on compiling
2008-07-10T06:30:00.000Z	pdg1		because I really have no clue how to compile...
2008-07-10T06:30:00.000Z	Drk_Guy		!compiling | pdg1
2008-07-10T06:31:00.000Z	pdg1		oh cool beans...
2008-07-10T06:32:00.000Z	pdg1		thanks Dr_guy
2008-07-10T06:32:00.000Z	pdg1		Drk_Guy
2008-07-10T06:33:00.000Z	Drk_Guy	pdg1	don't worry, and try writing drk and pressing tab ;)
2008-07-10T06:33:00.000Z	pdg1	Drk_Guy	WHOA!
2008-07-10T06:34:00.000Z	Drk_Guy		XD pdg1 :)
2008-07-10T06:34:00.000Z	pdg1		IRC is strange
2008-07-10T07:20:00.000Z	pdg1	Drk_Guy	it worked perfectly... turns out i didn't need to compile because gXiso is made with python
2008-07-10T07:20:00.000Z	Drk_Guy	pdg1	I'm happy to have helped you
2008-07-10T07:22:00.000Z	pdg1	Drk_Guy	but i'm wondering how I could get the .py file to be listed in the applications list... or something
2008-07-10T07:22:00.000Z	Drk_Guy	pdg1	Alt+F2, then alacarte, then, create a launcher where you would like it to be ;)
2008-07-10T07:23:00.000Z	Drk_Guy		!alien | Jman
2008-07-10T07:24:00.000Z	pdg1	Drk_Guy	that's fantastic... but I feel guilty being spoon fed everything... I'll try looking on google a little harder next time
