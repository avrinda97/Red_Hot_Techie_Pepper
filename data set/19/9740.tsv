2006-09-25T05:06:00.000Z	raf256_		how to dissallow Ubiquity from installing?
2006-09-25T05:07:00.000Z	raf256_		I found a bu in ubuntu, ubuntu 6.06 is uninstallable. Where to report it?
2006-09-25T05:07:00.000Z	Flannel	raf256_	launchpad.net
2006-09-25T05:08:00.000Z	Flannel	raf256_	make sure you're trying to install from 6.06.1, it's got an updated installer
2006-09-25T05:08:00.000Z	raf256_	Flannel	I *bought* 6.06
2006-09-25T05:09:00.000Z	Flannel	raf256_	why'd you buy it?  it's a free download.  And again, there were some prblems with ubiquity on 6.06, fixed in 6.06.1
2006-09-25T05:09:00.000Z	raf256_	Flannel	to support the ubuntu project and the reseleer
2006-09-25T05:09:00.000Z	Flannel	raf256_	reseller maybe, chances are he didn't pay anything to ubuntu.
2006-09-25T05:55:00.000Z	Flannel	raf256_	you could download 6.06.1 on DVD, then update it as a repository (update your sources.list), that'll update you to the 6.06.1 snapshot point, if you want to be perfectly up to date, you'll have to do quite a bit of tracking and downloading and then installing manually.
2006-09-25T05:56:00.000Z	raf256_	Flannel	erm... I have the internet on a Debian box.  Is there some thing like image, or list of files, like ubuntu_errat_6.06_to_6.06.1 ?
2006-09-25T05:57:00.000Z	Flannel	raf256_	the same places you downloaded the DVD iso, there are .manifest files, they list the stuff on the CDs, on the alternate (and the DVD) it's in a repository type format.  You can use that, but again, probably better off downloading the DVD itself
2006-09-25T05:58:00.000Z	raf256_	Flannel	it seems like a big waste of bandwitch for me
2006-09-25T05:59:00.000Z	Flannel	raf256_	well, you'll be downloading the packages for each update you want, which if you have a DVD, and more than one flavor installed, is going to be quite signifigant
2006-09-25T05:59:00.000Z	Flannel	raf256_	but, if you jsut want to get ubuntu or kubuntu installed, download 6.06.1 alternate
2006-09-25T06:00:00.000Z	Flannel	raf256_	On the DVD? or Alternate Iso? or LiveCD?
2006-09-25T06:00:00.000Z	raf256_	Flannel	I bought a newspaper with 3 dvds
2006-09-25T06:01:00.000Z	Flannel	raf256_	yes
2006-09-25T06:02:00.000Z	Flannel	raf256_	you mean trhough a gui? gksudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
