2009-12-21T03:11:00.000Z	burkmat	perlsyntax	Are you sure it's Ubuntu-related? Could it just be a bad connection?
2009-12-21T03:11:00.000Z	perlsyntax		i think something to do with ubuntu. 9.10
2009-12-21T03:12:00.000Z	perlsyntax		i use usb_modeswitch to look up the modem. it pick it up.
2009-12-21T03:13:00.000Z	perlsyntax	burkmat	could be something with dhcp?
