2005-05-22T14:05:00.000Z	BigJG		anyone know how to reset a init or something without restarting my comp? my computer thinks there is an ftp server when there isnt
2005-05-22T14:05:00.000Z	HappyFool	BigJG	that sounds very strange
2005-05-22T14:06:00.000Z	BigJG	HappyFool	yes I am thoroughly confused, I try to start my vsftpd server and it says it cant bind port 21, i dont have any other ftp server isntalled although i did uninstall one when i installed  vsftpd, That server may have been running when I uninstalled it so i wasnt sure if that was the cause
2005-05-22T14:07:00.000Z	HappyFool	BigJG	are you super-user ?
2005-05-22T14:07:00.000Z	HappyFool	BigJG	i.e., 'sudo /etc/init.d/vsftpd start'
2005-05-22T14:07:00.000Z	BigJG	HappyFool	I did sudo when I attempt to run the server
2005-05-22T14:07:00.000Z	HappyFool	BigJG	hrm
2005-05-22T14:07:00.000Z	HappyFool	BigJG	do a 'nestat -ant', and look for port 21
2005-05-22T14:08:00.000Z	BigJG	HappyFool	tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:21              0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN
2005-05-22T14:08:00.000Z	HappyFool	BigJG	so you have an ftp server running
2005-05-22T14:09:00.000Z	HappyFool	BigJG	try netstat -antp to see what's running on port 21
2005-05-22T14:09:00.000Z	BigJG	HappyFool	tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:21              0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN     -
2005-05-22T14:09:00.000Z	BigJG	HappyFool	It is acting really wierd
2005-05-22T14:10:00.000Z	HappyFool	BigJG	erm. try 'sudo netstat -antp'
2005-05-22T14:11:00.000Z	BigJG	HappyFool	OK now its showing as vsftpd, and for one reason or another I can now login to my ftp, thanks!
2005-05-22T14:12:00.000Z	HappyFool	BigJG	i think apt-get / dpkg / whatever starts it on install
2005-05-22T14:12:00.000Z	BigJG	HappyFool	I was just confused cause I tried to connect before and had no luck
2005-05-22T14:14:00.000Z	HappyFool	BigJG	I think's it's probably bash (?)
2005-05-22T14:18:00.000Z	BigJG	HappyFool	thanks much
