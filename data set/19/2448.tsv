2010-04-01T07:28:00.000Z	Gnea	hotxboy1S	you can run this command to see what version of grub2 is installed: dpkg -l | grep ^ii | grep grub2
2010-04-01T07:29:00.000Z	hotxboy1S	Gnea	hit dpkg -l | grep ^ii | grep grub2 but nothing uotput.
2010-04-01T07:29:00.000Z	Gnea	hotxboy1S	you're supposed to type that in a terminal.
2010-04-01T07:30:00.000Z	hotxboy1S	Gnea	I did in a terminal.
2010-04-01T07:31:00.000Z	Gnea	hotxboy1S	ok, yes, there should be some output.  try it like this then:  dpkg -l | grep ^ii | grep grub2 | awk '{print $3}'
2010-04-01T07:32:00.000Z	hotxboy1S	Gnea	R U KIDDING? STILL NO OUTPUT.
2010-04-01T07:32:00.000Z	Gnea	hotxboy1S	gonna have to ask you calm down if you want anymore help.
2010-04-01T07:33:00.000Z	Gnea	hotxboy1S	sorry, you typed that the same time I typed the new command.
2010-04-01T07:33:00.000Z	Gnea	hotxboy1S	so, no, I'm not kidding, but try changing it from 'grub2' to 'grub'
2010-04-01T07:34:00.000Z	Gnea	hotxboy1S	please run that command.
2010-04-01T07:35:00.000Z	Gnea	hotxboy1S	no no, I want the version number from dpkg, not from grub-install
2010-04-01T07:38:00.000Z	Gnea	hotxboy1S	yes.
