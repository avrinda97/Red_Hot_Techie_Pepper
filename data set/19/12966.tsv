2006-02-20T14:28:00.000Z	Prophet	wastrel	after the 30 min of d/l I edited a file to update everything, d/l that than i did the sudo apt-get install crap and it worked, no toying with glib or anything..... It was at this point I grabbed a cup of coffee and swore to only use linux as my OS, with MS it would have been too much effort...
