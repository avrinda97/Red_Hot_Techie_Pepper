2007-04-23T11:17:00.000Z	nevermind		anyone knows how to copy files in alphabetical order?
2007-04-23T11:17:00.000Z	mc44	nevermind	you can use "sort" to sort into alphabetical orfer
2007-04-23T11:18:00.000Z	nevermind	mc44	i tried, but i don't know how to use it, all i get is nothing and i have to kill sort with ctrl+c
2007-04-23T11:18:00.000Z	mc44	nevermind	right, you have to give it something to sort first :)
2007-04-23T11:18:00.000Z	mc44	nevermind	are you trying to copy all the files in a directory
2007-04-23T11:19:00.000Z	nevermind	mc44	well, i did try "sort ./*" and stuff like that
2007-04-23T11:19:00.000Z	mc44	nevermind	ls /* | sort
2007-04-23T11:19:00.000Z	nevermind	mc44	i'm trying to copy a folder with subfolders, but i need that for each subfolder all files in them are copied in alph order
2007-04-23T11:20:00.000Z	nevermind	mc44	a while ago i used a for as in "for i in *.jpg; do cp "$i"; done" and that worked
2007-04-23T11:20:00.000Z	nevermind	mc44	but it's only good for just one folder level, i need something stronger :P
2007-04-23T11:20:00.000Z	mc44	nevermind	but that doesnt work now?
2007-04-23T11:21:00.000Z	mc44	nevermind	how about 'ls */* | sort'
2007-04-23T11:21:00.000Z	mc44	nevermind	from the main folder
2007-04-23T11:22:00.000Z	nevermind	mc44	let me check, but i'm not sure that i can handle filenames in a for to copy them (the have special chars and spaces :S)
2007-04-23T11:23:00.000Z	mc44	nevermind	you need someone with more bash magic than me :) try asking in #bash
2007-04-23T11:24:00.000Z	nevermind	mc44	works, now, can you help me with the spacing trouble in this: for i in `ls */* | sort`; do echo "$i"; done
2007-04-23T11:24:00.000Z	nevermind	mc44	oki, will do, thanks :)
2007-04-23T12:30:00.000Z	mc44	nevermind	: but that wont remove all the of kubuntu-desktop only the kubuntu-dektop metapackage
2007-04-23T12:31:00.000Z	nevermind	mc44	i though --purge follows dependencies
