2012-03-07T22:58:00.000Z	trevor69420	igor_	have u tried VLC?
2012-03-07T23:02:00.000Z	trevor69420	igor_	is the disk mounting on the computer
2012-03-07T23:07:00.000Z	trevor69420	igor_	in VLC what happens if you hit ctrl+d
2012-03-07T23:09:00.000Z	trevor69420	igor_	and does the disk show up in there?
2012-03-07T23:11:00.000Z	trevor69420	igor_	usually it's not
2012-03-07T23:59:00.000Z	trevor69420	igor_	it's possible there is a DRM on the dvd which might be why it's not working correctly
2012-03-08T00:01:00.000Z	trevor69420	igor_	OGmrip will not transcode the video
2012-03-08T00:14:00.000Z	trevor69420	igor_	it's possible there are DRM protections on the DVD
2012-03-08T02:33:00.000Z	trevor69420	igor_	you should start with learning to navigate the directories using the command line... like learn about 'cd' and 'ls' and 'locate' and some file editing
