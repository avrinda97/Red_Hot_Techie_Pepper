2007-01-21T09:27:00.000Z	gotgenes		Anybody know what package has the info pages for grep?
2007-01-21T09:27:00.000Z	psYchotic	gotgenes	don't you just mean "man grep"?
2007-01-21T09:28:00.000Z	gotgenes	psYchotic	No, I am looking for the info pages
2007-01-21T09:29:00.000Z	psYchotic	gotgenes	and "info grep" doesn't work for you?
2007-01-21T09:29:00.000Z	gotgenes	psYchotic	Nope it gives me the Man pages
2007-01-21T09:30:00.000Z	psYchotic	gotgenes	ah, right. Well, it does for me too. I dunno where the info might be
2007-01-21T09:30:00.000Z	gotgenes	psYchotic	There's no /usr/share/info/grep.info.gz file anymore
2007-01-21T09:32:00.000Z	psYchotic	gotgenes	you might want to try the debian packages: http://packages.debian.org, apparently, the info pages for grep are in their packages
2007-01-21T09:34:00.000Z	gotgenes	psYchotic	should I file a bugreport on Launchpad? Those pages should be included.
2007-01-21T09:35:00.000Z	psYchotic	gotgenes	I dunno when to file a bugreport, but go ahead, coz they're not in any ubuntu package
2007-01-21T09:38:00.000Z	psYchotic	gotgenes	yeah, apparently, the info for grep is in the breezy reps
2007-01-21T09:38:00.000Z	gotgenes	psYchotic	http://tinyurl.com/36wgnw Saw that too
2007-01-21T09:40:00.000Z	psYchotic	gotgenes	I suppose it's a litlle mistake by whoever might have packaged grep for ubuntu dapper
2007-01-21T09:47:00.000Z	psYchotic	gotgenes	so file a bug report, and meanwhile, you might want to install the debian package
2007-01-21T09:47:00.000Z	psYchotic	gotgenes	since the grep.info.gz is in there
2007-01-21T09:47:00.000Z	psYchotic	gotgenes	I'll give you a tinyurl
2007-01-21T09:48:00.000Z	gotgenes	psYchotic	No need to install the whole package, I'll pick it open and just get the info.gz file and stick it in /usr/share/info/ directory.

2007-01-21T09:48:00.000Z	psYchotic	gotgenes	well, it's all up to you what you want to do. It's true that it might sound weird to install a whole new package just for the info, but yeah, it's up to you =)
