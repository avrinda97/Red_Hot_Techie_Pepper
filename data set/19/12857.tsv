2005-06-25T05:40:00.000Z	nonexx		hello
2005-06-25T05:40:00.000Z	nonexx		any idea why "startx" fails, and "sudo startx" works ?
2005-06-25T05:40:00.000Z	hondje	nonexx	just curious, why not use gdm?
2005-06-25T05:41:00.000Z	hondje	nonexx	sudo /etc/init.d/gdm start fails?
2005-06-25T05:41:00.000Z	nonexx	hondje	- gdm starts. But I cant login
2005-06-25T05:42:00.000Z	hondje	nonexx	or in auth.log?

2005-06-25T05:43:00.000Z	hondje	nonexx	hrm, fascinating
2005-06-25T05:44:00.000Z	hondje	nonexx	well, beats me man
2005-06-25T05:44:00.000Z	nonexx	hondje	- Ill try adding a new virgin user.
2005-06-25T05:45:00.000Z	nonexx	hondje	- brb
2005-06-25T05:47:00.000Z	nonexx	hondje	- same thing with a new created user.
2005-06-25T05:47:00.000Z	hondje	nonexx	I'm totally out of thoughts, man
2005-06-25T05:47:00.000Z	hondje	nonexx	that's really odd to me
2005-06-25T05:47:00.000Z	hondje	nonexx	mess with anything X related lately?
2005-06-25T05:48:00.000Z	nonexx	hondje	- nope. And it works fine as root
2005-06-25T05:48:00.000Z	hondje	nonexx	well damn, that's just bizarre....I'd tell you to ask in #ubuntu...but hrm
2005-06-25T05:49:00.000Z	hondje	nonexx	yeah, I can dig it, that's an insane bug
2005-06-25T05:50:00.000Z	hondje	nonexx	Maybe #gnome would know, since gdm is their thing
