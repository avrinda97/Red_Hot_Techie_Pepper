2010-01-27T05:12:00.000Z	mka	sharon_	write on one line and say exactly what is happening
2010-01-27T05:30:00.000Z	mka	sharon_	you can check graphics card using 'lspci | grep -i graphics'
2010-01-27T05:35:00.000Z	mka	sharon_	i think its not more that 2 lines, go ahead and paste it otherwise if it is more use pastebin
2010-01-27T05:36:00.000Z	mka	sharon_	copy everything and paste it at http://paste.ubuntu.com
2010-01-27T05:42:00.000Z	mka	sharon_	that is like an error message
2010-01-27T05:42:00.000Z	mka	sharon_	try again without quotes
2010-01-27T05:43:00.000Z	mka	sharon_	exactly this: lspci | grep -i graphics
2010-01-27T05:44:00.000Z	mka	sharon_	ok try what Crisis and Gstar are suggesting as well
