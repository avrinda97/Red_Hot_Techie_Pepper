2009-08-09T21:10:00.000Z	frevidar		if I'm using ubuntu, do I have access to (almost) all the packages in debian sid?
2009-08-09T21:10:00.000Z	stefg	frevidar	no, that'S a different (and not compatible) distro
2009-08-09T21:13:00.000Z	frevidar	stefg	I'm a little confused, the about page says: "Most of the packages in Ubuntu universe are also in Debian"
2009-08-09T21:13:00.000Z	frevidar	stefg	so there seems to be a relation
2009-08-09T21:13:00.000Z	frevidar	stefg	is the converse true?
2009-08-09T21:14:00.000Z	frevidar		halitech: what I mean is if there's package x in debian sid, will I be able to get package x in ubuntu?
2009-08-09T21:15:00.000Z	stefg	frevidar	ubuntu users debian as the upstream /source/.
2009-08-09T21:15:00.000Z	stefg		!debian | frevidar
2009-08-09T21:16:00.000Z	frevidar		so ubuntu "universe" packages are close to a superset of debians "unstable", at least at the time of ubuntu's release?
2009-08-09T21:16:00.000Z	stefg		frevidar:Dur to the different release process the packages are usually build with a different toolchain, so debian and ubuntu are not binary compatible in the strict sense
2009-08-09T21:17:00.000Z	stefg		!version | wastz
2009-08-09T21:17:00.000Z	stefg		!version | Wast3d2009
2009-08-09T21:18:00.000Z	frevidar	stefg	I'm not really worried about binary compatibility. I just don't want to use ubuntu if it provides significantly less packages than debian
2009-08-09T21:19:00.000Z	stefg	frevidar	all the good stuff is there, and a fair amount of ubuntu maintainers is also debian maintainers. If you don't need really exotic or bleeding edge stuff you should be fine with ubuntu
2009-08-09T21:20:00.000Z	frevidar	stefg	occasionally I'll need stuff thats exotic
2009-08-09T21:20:00.000Z	stefg	frevidar	you can still build it from source
2009-08-09T21:21:00.000Z	frevidar	stefg	what I found annoying about debian, whilst I was generally happy with stable, backporting things seemed to be a pain when I did want something new
2009-08-09T21:21:00.000Z	frevidar	stefg	that was a few years ago though
2009-08-09T21:21:00.000Z	stefg	frevidar	i think you'll be happy with ubuntu... if not give sidux a try
