2007-10-22T03:28:00.000Z	Creed	Pelo	when a company gets bought over, specially by someone who sides with the MAFIAA, its wise to stop using anything new that gets released from their collaboration until it gets proven that there are no "backdoors" or monitoring tools. I mainly torrent unlicensed anime and linux distros but for many its a darker story.

If I am misinformed then thats my problem :) Everyone has faults...I'll learn the truth when I feel like it, but for now I'd rather just stick to my beliefs.
