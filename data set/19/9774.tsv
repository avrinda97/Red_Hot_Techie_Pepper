2011-02-07T04:48:00.000Z	Leif		gparted*
2011-02-07T04:49:00.000Z	Leif		that will involve shrinking aswell, dunno about that
2011-02-07T04:49:00.000Z	Leif		it's probably possible but I don't know
2011-02-07T04:50:00.000Z	Leif		nice
2011-02-07T04:50:00.000Z	Leif		but anyone good with GRUB?
2011-02-07T04:51:00.000Z	Leif		as I said I only get a blinking cursor at boot, seems grub wont load properly
2011-02-07T04:51:00.000Z	Leif		but I have no idea what to try next
2011-02-07T04:52:00.000Z	q0z	Leif	do you get the grub shell?
2011-02-07T04:53:00.000Z	q0z	Leif	also true... but if grub IS installed, but not configured you'd get the grub shell
2011-02-07T04:53:00.000Z	q0z	Leif	a..
2011-02-07T04:54:00.000Z	q0z	Leif	did you install it to /dev/sda instead of /dev/sda1 ?
2011-02-07T04:54:00.000Z	q0z	Leif	no
2011-02-07T04:54:00.000Z	q0z	Leif	just checking, heh
2011-02-07T04:57:00.000Z	q0z	Leif	well i believe the problems above me.. i've run dry of ideas other than try some commands at the prompt you get i.e. tab, kernel, who... you can also check menu.lst or grub.conf (whichever you have) so that it points to the write kernel, initrd
2011-02-07T04:58:00.000Z	q0z	Leif	*right
2011-02-07T05:02:00.000Z	q0z	Leif	/etc/fstab, but no, i mean "nano /boot/grub/menu.lst" or the grub.conf file if you have that one.. and then look at the file paths to initd and kernel and check that they are correct, i.e. find a kernel and initrd that are located at those paths and if not change the paths manually
