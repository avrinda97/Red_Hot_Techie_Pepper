2012-04-16T22:19:00.000Z	xichael_		liveusb-creator has failed as well
2012-04-16T22:21:00.000Z	xichael_		is there some way i need to be formatting the drive? a few of the utilities offer to do it for me (to FAT32), but it didn't make any difference
2012-04-16T22:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xichael_	try unetbootin
2012-04-16T22:24:00.000Z	xichael_	ActionParsnip	i've tried Unetbootin,  Linux Live Usb Creator, and Universal USB Installer as well
2012-04-16T22:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xichael_	safe remove the device, jam it in a windows PC and format it FAT32
2012-04-16T22:26:00.000Z	xichael_	ActionParsnip	i've formatted to FAT32 a number of times, to no avail
2012-04-16T22:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xichael_	when you unplug from windows, do you safely remove the device?
2012-04-16T22:29:00.000Z	xichael_	ActionParsnip	i've been safely removing each time
2012-04-16T22:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xichael_	good, that's important
2012-04-16T22:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xichael_	if all alse fails, grab a magnet and put it on one side, then the other. Then format is and try again.
2012-04-16T22:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xichael_	try the mini install. May help. Use a wired connection and you can install using the repos
2012-04-16T22:37:00.000Z	xichael_	ActionParsnip	i'm on Windows 7
2012-04-16T22:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xichael_	so? You can put the mini ISO on the USB with Win7. What does the version of windows have to do with anything?
2012-04-16T22:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xichael_	you could even be using a Mac and the process using unetbootin is the same.....
2012-04-16T22:40:00.000Z	xichael_	ActionParsnip	ok, i thought you were referring to something i had to do from linux
2012-04-16T22:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xichael_	no, not at all. Its just a small installation that installs from the web rather than using the CD as the source of packages
2012-04-16T22:41:00.000Z	xichael_	ActionParsnip	do you have a link for some instructions?
2012-04-16T22:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xichael_	^
2012-04-16T22:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xichael_	its a different ISO to try
