2009-09-03T06:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Kheops	 rc.local is just commands like you would use from the command line.
2009-09-03T06:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Kheops	 if you need a complex commands to run.. make a script and have rc.local launch the script
2009-09-03T06:22:00.000Z	Kheops	Dr_Willis	: my command It's not auto load by the sys at reboot.
2009-09-03T06:22:00.000Z	Kheops	Dr_Willis	: I must autologin as root ?
2009-09-03T06:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Kheops	 Err... You dont understand what rc.local is doing then rc.local is ran WITHOUT the user logging in.. and the commands in rc.local are ran as root.
2009-09-03T06:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Kheops	 no gui needed. no user needed..
2009-09-03T06:23:00.000Z	Kheops	Dr_Willis	: dosen't work.
2009-09-03T06:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Kheops	 then i imagine you are doing somthing wrong.
2009-09-03T06:24:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Kheops	 i dont have 'esp' i dont know what you are running from rc.local
2009-09-03T06:25:00.000Z	Kheops	Dr_Willis	: I know.
2009-09-03T06:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Kheops	 give the channel some details and see what they figure out about your problem. so far you have said 'rc.local' dont work..  basically.. unless i missed some actual Info on the topic.
2009-09-03T06:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Kheops	 that command is getting ran as root.. whoch may or may not be what you want.
2009-09-03T06:29:00.000Z	Kheops	Dr_Willis	: I don't need a script to run that.
2009-09-03T06:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Kheops	 do whatever ya want then.. good luck..  my way is easier to trouble shoot.
