2006-05-18T16:10:00.000Z	steveire		And you do that manually? it's common to have a separate boot partition too?
2006-05-18T16:12:00.000Z	steveire		Indeed. So If I have a home folder already on a partition, I can tell the installer that it's there, and not to make a new one? Or do I let it make a new one, and then replace it with my mounted partition?
2006-05-18T16:13:00.000Z	steveire		And if I have a separate boot partition, Is that where my kernels are kept? (I'm planning on installing multiple distros, or at least having the option to)
2006-05-18T16:14:00.000Z	steveire		I currently have the option of using three ubuntu linux kernels at boot. Is that really neccessary, or can I remove the oldest two?
2006-05-18T16:15:00.000Z	steveire		OK, cool
2006-05-18T16:16:00.000Z	steveire		If I want to make a new boot partition, do I have to remove my current Ubuntu installation, and start again, telling the installer to use the boot partition?
2006-05-18T16:17:00.000Z	steveire		Thanks for the help, paradizelost, I hope my questions aren't too stupid. I tend to ask a lot of questions though...
2006-05-18T16:17:00.000Z	amphi	steveire	or backup, repartition, and restore
2006-05-18T16:18:00.000Z	steveire	amphi	Won't that restore /boot as it is in my current set up?
2006-05-18T16:23:00.000Z	amphi	steveire	not if you've made /boot a separate partition, and mounted it
2006-05-18T16:26:00.000Z	amphi	steveire	grub installs files in /boot/grub
2006-05-18T16:26:00.000Z	amphi	steveire	and writes some code to the mbr by default
2006-05-18T16:32:00.000Z	amphi	steveire	just keep /home on a separate partition is enough for that
2006-05-18T05:00:00.000Z	amphi	steveire	vfat is t3h 3vi1
2006-05-18T05:27:00.000Z	amphi	steveire	the 'bootable' flag?
2006-05-18T05:28:00.000Z	amphi	steveire	linux doesn't care about the bootable flag
2006-05-18T05:28:00.000Z	amphi	steveire	I'd leave that - windows used to feel sad without it, dunno if it still does
2006-05-18T05:30:00.000Z	amphi	steveire	"if it ain't broke, don't fix it" ;)
