2009-04-28T15:06:00.000Z	Ojii		what do i have to change in xorg.conf to get nVidia drivers running?
2009-04-28T15:06:00.000Z	sgallagh	Ojii	One or two cards?
2009-04-28T15:07:00.000Z	Ojii	sgallagh	One
2009-04-28T15:07:00.000Z	sgallagh	Ojii	Should be nothing :-P
2009-04-28T15:07:00.000Z	Ojii	sgallagh	but i can't install nvidia drivers in jaunty and get errors when booting
2009-04-28T15:08:00.000Z	sgallagh	Ojii	can you pastebin your /var/log/Xorg.0.log?
2009-04-28T15:09:00.000Z	Ojii	sgallagh	/var/log/Xorg.0.log: http://pastebin.com/m4e1069c6
2009-04-28T15:10:00.000Z	Ojii	sgallagh	and my current xorg.conf: http://pastebin.com/m79ca79ac
2009-04-28T15:11:00.000Z	sgallagh	Ojii	what are you seeing? According to that log, everything started up right
2009-04-28T15:11:00.000Z	Ojii	sgallagh	if i go to hardware stuff in system->Hardware Drivers none is activated
2009-04-28T15:12:00.000Z	Ojii	sgallagh	also i get an error when trying to edit nvidia settings: "You do not appear to be using the NVIDIA X driver. Please edit your X configuration file (just run `nvidia-xconfig` as root), and restart the X server."
2009-04-28T15:12:00.000Z	sgallagh	Ojii	And what happens if you tell it to select the nvidia driver?
2009-04-28T15:12:00.000Z	Ojii	sgallagh	it gives me a installatino bar which stays on 0% for a few seconds and closes again
2009-04-28T15:13:00.000Z	sgallagh	Ojii	Ok, that's a bug in the restricted driver installer. File it
2009-04-28T15:13:00.000Z	Ojii	sgallagh	?
2009-04-28T15:14:00.000Z	Ojii	sgallagh	what do you mean with 'file it' and how does that solve my problem?
2009-04-28T15:16:00.000Z	sgallagh	Ojii	Sorry, it doesn't really solve your problem, but I'm no expert on it. What I meant was go to Launchpad and file a bug on it so that someone who knows more about it will get back to you
2009-04-28T15:17:00.000Z	Ojii	sgallagh	ah okay, really desperately want those drivers, can't even watch movies in fullscreen atm...
2009-04-28T15:18:00.000Z	sgallagh	Ojii	That's because the open-source driver in Ubuntu is the crappy "nv" driver instead of the good "Nouveau" driver
