2011-12-11T19:22:00.000Z	exiff		I just saw that i have many open ports on my computer, how do i manage ports in ubuntu?
2011-12-11T19:22:00.000Z	Gentoo64	exiff	ufw is the easiest way
2011-12-11T19:23:00.000Z	Gentoo64	exiff	i take it you opened ports on your router (to your local ip) ? as ubuntus firewall is disabled by default
2011-12-11T19:25:00.000Z	Gentoo64	exiff	just do sudo ufw enable
2011-12-11T19:26:00.000Z	Gentoo64	exiff	sudo ufw enable, then sudo ufw allow 22 for eg
2011-12-11T19:26:00.000Z	Gentoo64	exiff	i take it you have no access to your router
2011-12-11T19:27:00.000Z	Gentoo64	exiff	ok well just close the ports you dont need in the router
2011-12-11T19:28:00.000Z	Gentoo64	exiff	ok
2011-12-11T19:29:00.000Z	Gentoo64	exiff	weird
2011-12-11T19:30:00.000Z	Gentoo64	exiff	what does the command (as root) ss -l
2011-12-11T19:30:00.000Z	Gentoo64	exiff	idk
2011-12-11T19:32:00.000Z	Gentoo64	exiff	what does ss-l say
2011-12-11T19:34:00.000Z	Gentoo64	exiff	yeah some are local
2011-12-11T19:35:00.000Z	Gentoo64	exiff	you shouldnt need one, its pretty straightforward
2011-12-11T19:38:00.000Z	Gentoo64	exiff	cool. make sure you're not using DMZ (sounds like you might be)
2011-12-11T19:38:00.000Z	Gentoo64	exiff	basically lets any port open
2011-12-11T19:40:00.000Z	Gentoo64	exiff	it shouldnt be enabled by default. who normally sets up your router?
2011-12-11T19:40:00.000Z	Gentoo64	exiff	oh ok
2011-12-11T19:40:00.000Z	Gentoo64	exiff	not sure what they did. normally all ports are closed unless you specially open them
