2010-04-28T03:46:00.000Z	plum		is there any way to install ubuntu on ext3 partition?
2010-04-28T03:47:00.000Z	plum		install cd * (i'm  using usb livedisk)
2010-04-28T03:49:00.000Z	plum		ooh i see
2010-04-28T03:51:00.000Z	plum		is there any way i can specify which hard drive to install on?
2010-04-28T03:51:00.000Z	Typos_King	plum	   sure, on the install screen, choose 'manual'
2010-04-28T03:53:00.000Z	Typos_King	plum	   'lose'?   like what?
2010-04-28T03:54:00.000Z	plum	Typos_King	like for example, if you move from NTFS to FAT you won't be able to change permissions anymore
2010-04-28T03:54:00.000Z	Typos_King	plum	    I've used both, I saw no advantage to ext4 :|, I'm on ext3
2010-04-28T03:57:00.000Z	Typos_King	plum	   10.04 gets released tomorrow, why not just install it then? :P
2010-04-28T03:58:00.000Z	Typos_King	plum	so, 2 days... IMO better a full-install than an unnecessary upgrade
2010-04-28T04:02:00.000Z	Typos_King	plum	    what you can do on that is, save Grub to the external device MBR, and yes, it won't boot cuz it's looking for its /boot/grub files to boot with, and in your case it was on the HD mbr, while its files where on the external, thus the error
2010-04-28T04:03:00.000Z	plum	Typos_King	i did try that... i installed ubuntu on /dev/sdb, but grub to /dev/sda
2010-04-28T04:03:00.000Z	Typos_King	plum	   saving grub to the external device will load it 'when booting from usb' device
2010-04-28T04:04:00.000Z	plum	Typos_King	my secondary harddrive is not USB though. it fits into my optical drive in a little compartment, directly to the computer
2010-04-28T04:05:00.000Z	Typos_King	plum	    sudo grub-install /dev/sdb;    will stick it to the 'sdb' MBR, and thus will bring it up when the usb is being booted from, then it'll find its files and all
2010-04-28T04:06:00.000Z	Typos_King	plum	  even so, the 'grub error', comes up for having the grub loaded on the HD mbr and its files elsewhere
2010-04-28T04:07:00.000Z	plum	Typos_King	why does ubuntu install the files elsewhere then? shouildn't it install the files to wherever mbr you installed grub to in the first place?
2010-04-28T04:08:00.000Z	Typos_King	plum	  nope, the boot loader you get when you boot a machine, is the one loaded in the MBR of the 1st internal/fixed HD in the machine, regardless of how many there are, slaves or else, and partitions in them
2010-04-28T04:09:00.000Z	Typos_King	plum	  that's the boot loader you get upon boot from a machine, its files can be anywhere
