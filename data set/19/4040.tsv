2009-07-02T21:34:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	te_	uh, yeah, i know
2009-07-02T21:34:00.000Z	te_	Mike_lifeguard	But if you only need to delet the last or last partitions, it won't effect the first ones
2009-07-02T21:35:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	te_	I know. I was asking about making partition table changes without changing (ie losing) the data
2009-07-02T21:35:00.000Z	te_	Mike_lifeguard	If you have 4 partitions and you delete #4  it will not effec the others.
2009-07-02T21:35:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	te_	I know.
2009-07-02T21:36:00.000Z	te_	Mike_lifeguard	Otherwise  use gparted
2009-07-02T21:36:00.000Z	te_	Mike_lifeguard	Did I missunderstand your question?
2009-07-02T21:37:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	te_	YES :D

2009-07-02T21:37:00.000Z	te_	Mike_lifeguard	What is your question?
