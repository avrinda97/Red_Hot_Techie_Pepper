2009-11-29T20:46:00.000Z	chakie		any hints for my wife's karmic that doesn't boot after a normal package update?
2009-11-29T20:46:00.000Z	chakie		"udevadm trigger is not permitted while udev is unconfigured"
2009-11-29T20:46:00.000Z	chakie		svgalib: cannot open /dev/mem
2009-11-29T20:46:00.000Z	chakie		and then it drops to a busybox shell
2009-11-29T20:47:00.000Z	chakie		and grub is totally dead, you can't activate the normal menu by pressing Esc
2009-11-29T20:47:00.000Z	chakie		seems to be a common bug based on some googling, but no answers
2009-11-29T20:47:00.000Z	chakie		#358654 in launchpad
2009-11-29T20:47:00.000Z	chakie		any hints?
2009-11-29T20:47:00.000Z	legend2440	chakie	to get the grub menu hold down the Shift key
2009-11-29T20:48:00.000Z	legend2440	chakie	at boot
2009-11-29T20:48:00.000Z	chakie	legend2440	when booting is says to click Esc...
2009-11-29T20:48:00.000Z	chakie	legend2440	nope, no change
2009-11-29T20:48:00.000Z	legend2440	chakie	ok she did a upgrade not a clean install?
2009-11-29T20:49:00.000Z	chakie	legend2440	yes, just a normal safe-upgrade of available packages for a running karmic
2009-11-29T20:50:00.000Z	legend2440	chakie	ok i see  Shift key is for  grub2
2009-11-29T20:51:00.000Z	chakie	legend2440	it prompts to press esc, then counts down 2s or so and then fails
2009-11-29T20:51:00.000Z	chakie	legend2440	and does not bother whatever is pressed or held down
2009-11-29T21:09:00.000Z	legend2440	chakie	if she has been upgrading since 7.04  it may be time to do a clean install
2009-11-29T21:09:00.000Z	chakie	legend2440	for a debian based system? why+
