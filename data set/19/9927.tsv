2006-09-26T13:32:00.000Z	ladydoor		ok, i've got a question. a lot of people in here ask about 3D acceleration, whether with nvidia or ati. What are the benefits of it? Does it matter for somebody who only uses, say, ratpoison WM and isn't a gamer?
2006-09-26T13:33:00.000Z	POVaddct	ladydoor	mostly it's needed for games
2006-09-26T13:33:00.000Z	ladydoor	POVaddct	ok, that about answers my question. thanks a lot!
2006-09-26T13:33:00.000Z	POVaddct	ladydoor	window managers normally take no advantage of 3d accel
2006-09-26T13:35:00.000Z	POVaddct	ladydoor	for example on my machines i have no 3d accel at all. i simply don't need it.
2006-09-26T13:35:00.000Z	ladydoor	POVaddct	that makes sense. yeah, i don't have it either, and was just kind of wondering if i was missing out. lol
2006-09-29T14:09:00.000Z	POVaddct	ladydoor	the problem with screen-like window managers is that many older X apps still need the mouse
2006-09-29T14:09:00.000Z	ladydoor	POVaddct	also many newer ones. luckily, i don't use them, except for conkeror and sometimes xpdf
2006-09-29T14:10:00.000Z	POVaddct	ladydoor	so why do you use X anyway? you could use a framebuffer console with screen
2006-09-29T14:12:00.000Z	ladydoor	POVaddct	better text resolution and conkeror/ratpoison :-)
2006-09-29T14:12:00.000Z	POVaddct	ladydoor	hehe
2006-09-29T14:12:00.000Z	ladydoor	POVaddct	i meant conkeror/firefox
2006-09-29T14:12:00.000Z	ladydoor	POVaddct	it's easier to use than elinks/w3m.
2006-09-29T14:14:00.000Z	POVaddct	ladydoor	i use X with XFCE. as a web browser i use dillo, mozilla and w3m, depending on the situation
2006-09-29T14:14:00.000Z	ladydoor	POVaddct	though quick question:  does ubuntu's framebuffer work this time around? (i.e., could i, say, watch a movie without starting X (i boot to commandline)?)
2006-09-29T14:14:00.000Z	ladydoor	POVaddct	cool
2006-10-04T15:21:00.000Z	POVaddct	ladydoor	are you from germany? then you should know sven guckes, he is the text tools pope :)
2006-10-04T15:22:00.000Z	ladydoor	POVaddct	i'm not from germany...i'm from the us (we're not all yahoos, i promise)
2006-10-04T15:22:00.000Z	ladydoor	POVaddct	thank you, though :-)
