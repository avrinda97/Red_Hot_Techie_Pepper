2010-11-10T01:21:00.000Z	dax2112rush		Hi, I messed up pretty bad: chmodded sudoers and now sudo refuses to work cause sudoers is not 440. How can I modify the sudoers file without using sudo?
2010-11-10T01:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dax2112rush	make a note of what is expected, boot to root recovery mode and set it, then stop messing with the file
2010-11-10T01:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dax2112rush	sure, just run: sudo -i ,and you will be able to. Do as you wish
2010-11-10T01:24:00.000Z	dax2112rush	ActionParsnip	sudo -i complains about sudoers file
2010-11-10T01:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dax2112rush	you can run all commands sans password til you type: exit
2010-11-10T01:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dax2112rush	yes. You need to reboot to root recovery mode, like I said earlier
2010-11-10T01:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dax2112rush	if you did you aren't running ubuntu. The first account you made is not. Root, its a user
2010-11-10T01:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dax2112rush	ok then boot to root recovery and run: chmod o-w /etc/sudoers
2010-11-10T01:27:00.000Z	dax2112rush	ActionParsnip	I can't I need a root password, but once I'll get a root console, I should be OK
2010-11-10T01:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dax2112rush	hold shift at boot, select recovery mode, then select root. You can then undo your mess
2010-11-10T01:28:00.000Z	dax2112rush	ActionParsnip	: for some reason, I need a password to drop to root console
2010-11-10T01:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dax2112rush	then you set a root password which isn't needed or advised
2010-11-10T01:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dax2112rush	you really are intent on destroying your. OS aren't you....
2010-11-10T01:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dax2112rush	jrib knows some jiggery pokery. I recommend using liveCd and chrooting
2010-11-10T01:30:00.000Z	dax2112rush	ActionParsnip	yeah well I don't really want to destroy it, some stupid mistake I guess
2010-11-10T01:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dax2112rush	you'll learn. You have a lot of work ahead
2010-11-10T01:33:00.000Z	dax2112rush	ActionParsnip	learning is fun :)
2010-11-10T01:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dax2112rush	the sooner you forget root and stick to sudo, the easier life is
2010-11-10T01:34:00.000Z	dax2112rush	ActionParsnip	I never use root to be honest, It seems I may have once, but can't remember it
