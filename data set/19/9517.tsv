2008-06-21T17:14:00.000Z	Riotta		maybe it's your profile doctorow
2008-06-21T17:15:00.000Z	Riotta		move it your profile in /home/yourusername/.mozilla/firefox to some backup directory and run firefox again doctorow
2008-06-21T17:17:00.000Z	Riotta		is english your native language ? or u use something more exotic maybe it's locales fault? bad localization or bug in them
2008-06-21T17:18:00.000Z	Riotta		ok
2008-06-21T17:18:00.000Z	Riotta		well hmm :d
2008-06-21T17:19:00.000Z	Riotta		what can I say maybe somehow the firefox package corrupted you using it from ubuntu repository or some other place ?
2008-06-21T17:19:00.000Z	Riotta		if it's corrupted go to synaptic and reinstall the firefox package
2008-06-21T17:20:00.000Z	Riotta		gnome ?
2008-06-21T17:20:00.000Z	doctorow	Riotta	yes, Gnome
2008-06-21T17:14:00.000Z	doctorow	Riotta	tell me more?
2008-06-21T17:16:00.000Z	doctorow	Riotta	I did that and when Ffox 3 relaunched the confirguration Ui was still all in bad characters
2008-06-21T17:18:00.000Z	doctorow	Riotta	I'm a native English speaker, and the rest of my UI is in English
2008-06-21T17:19:00.000Z	doctorow	Riotta	-- I tried reinstalling, no love!
2008-06-21T17:20:00.000Z	Riotta	doctorow	what window manager you use ?
2008-06-21T17:21:00.000Z	doctorow	Riotta	Also, the UI is HUGE -- all the buttons are GIGANTIC, as is the Googlebar, etc
2008-06-21T17:22:00.000Z	doctorow	Riotta	but it seems like it's just in FFox 3, not in any other apps or the Gnome or FFox 2
2008-06-21T17:23:00.000Z	Riotta	doctorow	try what happen if you move entire .mozilla folder to another place and restart firefox
2008-06-21T17:24:00.000Z	doctorow	Riotta	same thing...
2008-06-21T17:25:00.000Z	Riotta	doctorow	give me the answer of this command 'xdpyinfo | grep resolution'
