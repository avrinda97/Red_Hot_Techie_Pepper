2009-09-05T02:07:00.000Z	Greek-Boy		I am running Ubuntu 9.04 on a Dell Studio Slim 540s. I can't get a resolution of 1920 x 1200 which is native on my HP 2335 23" 16:10 monitor. Can someone tell me how to resolve this?
2009-09-05T02:09:00.000Z	Greek-Boy		ThRixXx" I used the dell iso dvd which is supposed to do that.
2009-09-05T02:11:00.000Z	scott_ino2	Greek-Boy	open up a terminal from Applications/accessories terminal then type lspci in the terminal and it will tell you
2009-09-05T02:12:00.000Z	scott_ino2	Greek-Boy	hit enter after typing lspci and then it'll spit out a list of your hardware
2009-09-05T02:13:00.000Z	scott_ino2	Greek-Boy	so you have an intel based graphics chipset
2009-09-05T02:15:00.000Z	scott_ino2	Greek-Boy	it appears ThRixXx has this under control i'll just be here for moral support

2009-09-05T02:17:00.000Z	scott_ino2	Greek-Boy	when you go to System/Administration/Hardware drivers tell me what you get there

2009-09-05T02:19:00.000Z	scott_ino2	Greek-Boy	perhaps, but let's make sure you're using the right drivers first
