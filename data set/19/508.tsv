2012-08-31T04:12:00.000Z	Troy^	Sach	does this vcd work on anything else?
2012-08-31T04:12:00.000Z	Sach	Troy^	lol .  yes, it works in a dvd player, but not in ubuntu.
2012-08-31T04:13:00.000Z	Sach	Troy^	mplayer and vlc
2012-08-31T04:13:00.000Z	Troy^	Sach	from a url . The better and simpler solution is to install gxine through synaptic. And believe it or not, it works! Once you open gxine, then there will be an option for DVD/VCD etcâ€¦ choose VCD and you have a player that plays VCDs. The Screenshot below is of the gxine menu.
2012-08-31T04:18:00.000Z	Sach	Troy^	I installed gxine. but now how do I open it? it'not listed under Sound and Video.
