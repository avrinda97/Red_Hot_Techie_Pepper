2007-09-08T16:13:00.000Z	blix_		My aim: Ubuntu, XP, Vista
2007-09-08T16:13:00.000Z	blix_		should I use GRUB to bootload these?
2007-09-08T16:13:00.000Z	blix_		do people still use LILO I thnk it's called?
2007-09-08T16:14:00.000Z	dumbass	blix_	competent people do, try slackware
2007-09-08T16:14:00.000Z	dumbass	blix_	yeah, it's a little nicer and doesn't break all the time
2007-09-08T16:15:00.000Z	dumbass	blix_	i need um, like, help because my box woe not turn on
2007-09-08T16:17:00.000Z	dumbass	blix_	no, but lilo will
2007-09-08T16:17:00.000Z	dumbass	blix_	yeah, it's also easier to change the look and feel of it
2007-09-08T16:18:00.000Z	dumbass	blix_	lilo is also more stable
2007-09-08T16:19:00.000Z	dumbass	blix_	as it's default with ubuntu, that's a good call, but honestly, if you get more into linux, you'll want slackware, anyway
2007-09-08T16:21:00.000Z	dumbass	blix_	in lilo you type 'liloconfig' and it automatically sets it all up for you
2007-09-08T16:21:00.000Z	dumbass	blix_	you'll want to install xp and vista _first_ or use a livecd after the installs
2007-09-08T16:21:00.000Z	dumbass	blix_	i do it all the time
2007-09-08T16:22:00.000Z	blix_	dumbass	well whatever it takes to install Vista, XP and Ubuntu on one HDD
2007-09-08T16:23:00.000Z	dumbass	blix_	it is, it likes to take over the bootloader
2007-09-08T16:24:00.000Z	dumbass	blix_	or you could install lilo with a livecd and avoid the whole mess of bootloaders altogether, just remembr which dev/hd# has your linux kernel on it and which partitions have what os's installed-- best to write it out on paper while you're doing it
2007-09-08T16:25:00.000Z	dumbass	blix_	depends on which bootloader you use, honestly-- if you messup the order you can still fix it.  I wouldn't worry about your vista partition--- if I understand right it's ntfs which you can prepare with fdisk
2007-09-08T16:26:00.000Z	dumbass	blix_	try pidgin
2007-09-08T16:28:00.000Z	dumbass	blix_	it already has
