2007-12-19T06:50:00.000Z	Agiofws	NumBeast	 youhave to have compiz ? to gethe cube effect ?
2007-12-19T06:50:00.000Z	NumBeast	Agiofws	yes, you have to have compiz. But it comes default with 7.10, so you probably already have it
2007-12-19T06:51:00.000Z	NumBeast	Agiofws	but you need to install compiz-settings to get the control panel
2007-12-19T06:52:00.000Z	NumBeast	Agiofws	t's metacity, why
2007-12-19T06:56:00.000Z	NumBeast	Agiofws	sorry, that's not the real name, but in synaptic to name/description search for compiz settings
