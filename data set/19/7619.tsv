2008-02-06T00:20:00.000Z	ikonia	b4l74z4r	not installed/configured correctly, wrong drivers ? could be many reasons
2008-02-06T00:20:00.000Z	ikonia	b4l74z4r	you don't need exotic hardware to be miss-configued
2008-02-06T00:21:00.000Z	b4l74z4r	ikonia	but shouldn't compiz be able to configure itself correctly on regular hardware?
