2005-08-07T11:26:00.000Z	PurpleMotion		wtf does that mean
2005-08-07T11:26:00.000Z	lunitik	PurpleMotion	why are you using mplayer?
2005-08-07T11:27:00.000Z	lunitik	PurpleMotion	you have codecs installed?
2005-08-07T11:28:00.000Z	lunitik	PurpleMotion	^^
2005-08-07T11:29:00.000Z	lunitik	PurpleMotion	no idea...
2005-08-07T11:30:00.000Z	lunitik	PurpleMotion	thus trying to figure it out...
2005-08-07T11:30:00.000Z	PurpleMotion	lunitik	 yeah, good luck.. i been pulling my hair out over it for a week
2005-08-08T14:46:00.000Z	PurpleMotion	lunitik	 which really isnt necessary (just mount it somewhere) and could suck big time if a large file got split across the drives
2005-08-08T14:47:00.000Z	lunitik	PurpleMotion	true enough... which is why I'm not using LVM  ;)
2005-08-08T14:50:00.000Z	lunitik	PurpleMotion	I've never seen anything refering to that... LVM, you can have disks on many computers act like one though... all your systems can share a central virtual harddrive...
2005-08-08T14:50:00.000Z	lunitik	PurpleMotion	don't ask me... thats the idea behind LVM1/2 though
2005-08-08T14:52:00.000Z	lunitik	PurpleMotion	Red Hat is pushing LVM2 also, so you may want to get your head around it somwhat... everything Red Hat pushes becomes a defacto standard in the Linux world eventually...
2005-08-08T14:55:00.000Z	lunitik	PurpleMotion	teach it  :)
2005-08-08T14:56:00.000Z	PurpleMotion	lunitik	 as soon as i find it ont he wiki, i intend to
2005-08-08T14:59:00.000Z	lunitik	PurpleMotion	so long as its correct, I don't see why not  :)
2005-08-09T12:39:00.000Z	lunitik	PurpleMotion	if you have some time... and some patience... couldn't do any harm
2005-08-09T12:39:00.000Z	PurpleMotion	lunitik	 sudo apt-get install xorg-driver-fglrx xorg-driver-fglrx-dev fglrx-control
2005-08-09T12:40:00.000Z	PurpleMotion	lunitik	 yeah, it is
