2007-03-02T17:26:00.000Z	SpudDogg		OPINION:  I can't even remember the last time I booted into Windows.  Do you think it's safe for me to take it off my machine and install Kubuntu just to play with it?
2007-03-02T17:28:00.000Z	jrib	SpudDogg	well yes in the sense that you can use the space windows is taking up for something better.  But, no in the sense that you can try kubuntu by installing kubuntu-desktop.  You can switch between kde and gnome at the login screen
2007-03-02T17:29:00.000Z	SpudDogg	jrib	 You mean I can just run 'sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop' and then switch at boot?  Are you sure I won't screw up my Ubuntu installation if I do that?
2007-03-02T17:31:00.000Z	jrib	SpudDogg	you don't switch at boot, you just choose your desktop environment when you login.  It's perfectly safe, ubuntu just has GNOME by default (ubuntu-desktop pacakge) and Kubuntu has kde by default (kubuntu-desktop) package.  But everything else is the same, they use the same repositories, etc.  It shouldn't mess anything up.  I'd recommend using  aptitude install kubunt-desktop  since that will allow you to easily remove kubuntu-desktop and its deps
2007-03-02T17:32:00.000Z	SpudDogg	jrib	 So I'm really only installing the KDE then.  That sounds to me like all of my settings (network, /etc/apt/sources.list, etc) will still be used.  Is that correct?
2007-03-02T17:33:00.000Z	jrib	SpudDogg	yes, you are right.  You are installing kde and the kubuntu applications like its text editor, browser, ...
2007-03-02T17:34:00.000Z	jrib	SpudDogg	you can have dozens of window manager to choose from if you want
2007-03-02T17:35:00.000Z	jrib	SpudDogg	well aptitude has an ncurses interface too.  The most important difference imo is that aptitude keeps track of when things are installed as dependencies.  So that if you install A and A pulls in B and C, then when you remove A, aptitude will tell you that B and C are no longer needed and let you remove them easily
2007-03-02T17:37:00.000Z	jrib	SpudDogg	yes, I do.   for installation and removing I usually prefer aptitude.  Oh, aptitude installs "recommended" packages by default too, apt-get doesn't.  Here's the documentation, http://people.debian.org/~dburrows/aptitude-doc/en/, aptitude's search is really powerful too as you can see.
2007-03-02T17:38:00.000Z	SpudDogg	jrib	h1st0, crdlb:  Excellent.  Thanks very much fellas.
2007-03-02T17:42:00.000Z	SpudDogg	jrib	 One last question while kubuntu-desktop installs:  Right now I have a keyboard shortcut set up to open a terminal window (alt+t).  If I'm in KDE, will that open a terminal or konsole or nothing?
2007-03-02T17:42:00.000Z	jrib	SpudDogg	won't do anything probably, you'll have to configure it in kde
2007-03-02T17:42:00.000Z	SpudDogg	jrib	 gotcha.  thanks
2007-05-21T15:23:00.000Z	jrib	SpudDogg	did you install sshd?  If not, there won't be a server running
2007-05-21T15:24:00.000Z	SpudDogg	jrib	this is on a server install.  Right now I can log in to any user...I want only ONE user to be allowed to log in.  If I need root or some other user, I'll use 'su'
2007-05-21T15:24:00.000Z	jrib	SpudDogg	man sshd_config   take a look at DenyUsers and AllowUsers
2007-05-21T15:25:00.000Z	SpudDogg	jrib	thank you...i dont know why i didnt think of the manual.  RTFM!
2007-09-07T05:23:00.000Z	jrib	SpudDogg	what video card?
2007-09-12T13:20:00.000Z	SpudDogg	jrib	is this guy for real?  something tells me he's a regular playing a joke or something
