2005-11-30T13:57:00.000Z	dragonbyte		Hey, I just installed ubuntu breezy and can't get DVD playback to work with xine or totem
2005-11-30T13:57:00.000Z	dragonbyte		spitting errors about unable to read NAV packet
2005-11-30T13:57:00.000Z	dragonbyte		mplayer however seems to be able to play the DVD fine
2005-11-30T13:57:00.000Z	dragonbyte		any ideas?
2005-11-30T13:59:00.000Z	dragonbyte		xine-ui and totem-gstreamer
2005-11-30T14:01:00.000Z	dragonbyte		they only thing i have been able to find is a bunch of nonsense about libdvdcss2
2005-11-30T14:01:00.000Z	dragonbyte		and i have that installed
2005-11-30T14:01:00.000Z	dragonbyte		and its working since mplayer can play the dvd
2005-11-30T14:02:00.000Z	arnducky	dragonbyte	you could try updating your libdvdnav
2005-11-30T14:02:00.000Z	dragonbyte	arnducky	newest, this is a fresh install
2005-11-30T14:03:00.000Z	dragonbyte	arnducky	mplayer plays the dvd fine
2005-11-30T14:06:00.000Z	arnducky	dragonbyte	does this happen at initialization or midstream?
2005-11-30T14:06:00.000Z	dragonbyte	arnducky	init
2005-11-30T14:07:00.000Z	arnducky	dragonbyte	did you compile from CVS?
2005-11-30T14:08:00.000Z	arnducky	dragonbyte	did you install libdvdcss after xine-ui, or before?
2005-11-30T14:08:00.000Z	dragonbyte	arnducky	both
2005-11-30T14:08:00.000Z	dragonbyte	arnducky	after initially
2005-11-30T14:09:00.000Z	arnducky	dragonbyte	totem is aPoS -- I never use it -- excpet as a plugin/MIME handler
2005-11-30T14:10:00.000Z	dragonbyte	arnducky	I cant get xine to work either
