2011-10-30T02:39:00.000Z	prophet		hello, i need help installing grub on a multiboot pc
2011-10-30T02:41:00.000Z	urlin2u	prophet	what are the OS's  now?
2011-10-30T02:42:00.000Z	prophet	urlin2u	now i booted from an ubuntu usb drive, and installed on pc are osx, win7, linux (without grub). and i need to install it on / not on sda
2011-10-30T02:44:00.000Z	urlin2u	prophet	why root, the files should already be there, you trying to use easybcd?
2011-10-30T02:44:00.000Z	urlin2u	prophet	ah I just saw the osx in it a mac or a pc?
2011-10-30T02:44:00.000Z	prophet	urlin2u	in a pc
2011-10-30T02:45:00.000Z	urlin2u	prophet	what boot loader are you using to pickup everything?
2011-10-30T02:45:00.000Z	prophet	urlin2u	now i use chameleon and i'd like to stick with it since i don't have to do any more stuff
2011-10-30T02:47:00.000Z	urlin2u	prophet	never used chameleon, so it does not see the standard grub 2 files in the root already, you might try a forum that is specifiuc in this area, besides this channel I'm not sure about putting the grub stuff that goes to the mbr will fix this are you?
2011-10-30T02:48:00.000Z	prophet	urlin2u	i don't know how to tell grub to install on the right partition, that's all
2011-10-30T02:50:00.000Z	prophet	urlin2u	the partition is mounted but when i type df, i donno which is which
2011-10-30T02:55:00.000Z	urlin2u	prophet	gparted or another partitioner will identify the partitions, yiou don't say from where your mounting the partition, we know it is not windows hehe.
2011-10-30T02:57:00.000Z	prophet	urlin2u	i'm on a linux booted from an usb drive right now
2011-10-30T02:58:00.000Z	urlin2u	prophet	look here the grub2 wiki https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2#Upgrading  Honerstly I would go to the XXXXXtosh forum they will know this stuf I don't think this wiki has the answer.
2011-10-30T03:00:00.000Z	prophet	urlin2u	the mac part is ok
2011-10-30T03:01:00.000Z	prophet	urlin2u	i get this error while grub-install /dev/sdb4 Probing devices to guess BIOS drives. This may take a long time.
2011-10-30T03:05:00.000Z	urlin2u	prophet	here is a ubuntu forum link the poster mierfra is one of the best in this area as far as knowledge out side of the builders, might be some clues there. http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1339771
2011-10-30T03:06:00.000Z	prophet	urlin2u	thanks
2011-10-30T03:07:00.000Z	urlin2u	prophet	this command your using is from the running OS or chrooted in as well grub-install /dev/sdb4
