2007-10-21T20:05:00.000Z	stemount		;)
2007-10-21T20:06:00.000Z	stemount		I just use the normal Ubuntu one
2007-10-21T20:06:00.000Z	stemount		its fine. but KDE is really lame on memory :(
2007-10-21T20:06:00.000Z	xsacha	stemount	KDE uses less RAM for me?
2007-10-21T20:07:00.000Z	xsacha	stemount	gnome is using 400MB for me and kde uses 180MB when im using kubuntu
2007-10-21T20:07:00.000Z	stemount	xsacha	thats because you have gnome libraries loaded too i guess?
2007-10-21T20:07:00.000Z	xsacha	stemount	how do i not have gnome libraries?
2007-10-21T20:08:00.000Z	stemount	xsacha	KDE was 300mb+ compared to gnome 150mb :/
2007-10-21T20:08:00.000Z	xsacha	stemount	what did you have to do?
2007-10-21T20:08:00.000Z	stemount	xsacha	?
2007-10-21T20:09:00.000Z	xsacha	stemount	to get gnome down to 150
2007-10-21T20:09:00.000Z	xsacha	stemount	i have 400mb under gnome right now. all i have running is pidgin, firefox, compiz and AWN
2007-10-21T20:17:00.000Z	xsacha	stemount	i agree, i think it's just gutsy. ram usage doubled here?
2007-10-21T20:17:00.000Z	stemount	xsacha	same..
2007-10-21T20:19:00.000Z	stemount	xsacha	It doesn't bother me Gutsy has double RAM. It never touches past 400mb RAM
2007-10-21T20:20:00.000Z	xsacha	stemount	doesnt really bother me since using 500mb of cache never helped me much
