2009-10-30T05:17:00.000Z	stone1343	randal	use netbook remix, i just installed, it's great
2009-10-30T05:18:00.000Z	randal	stone1343	i guess but i just installed the non remix version
2009-10-30T05:18:00.000Z	stone1343	randal	i think you can add the package through synaptic
2009-10-30T05:19:00.000Z	stone1343	randal	it's the same as base ubuntu (as far as i can tell) just interface optimized for a netbook
2009-10-30T05:20:00.000Z	randal	stone1343	 i know i had 9.04 with remix but i had some bugs how can i add remix in synapic
2009-10-30T05:22:00.000Z	randal	stone1343	thanks i found it 9.10 is awsome
2009-10-30T05:22:00.000Z	stone1343	randal	agreed 9.10 is awesome
2009-10-30T05:24:00.000Z	randal	stone1343	i love what they did with the boot its so pretty lol
2009-10-30T05:42:00.000Z	stone1343	randal	you don't like netbook remix?
2009-10-30T05:43:00.000Z	randal	stone1343	i like it but i also like the classic way and cant figure out how to switch on the old remix you were able too
2009-10-30T05:43:00.000Z	stone1343	randal	i don't remember off the top of my head
2009-10-30T05:43:00.000Z	randal	stone1343	there use to be a setting you could change but i cant find it on this new one
2009-10-30T05:44:00.000Z	randal	stone1343	im staring to think you cant
2009-10-30T05:45:00.000Z	stone1343	randal	pretty sure i did with an earlier build
2009-10-30T05:45:00.000Z	randal	stone1343	i did to with 9.04 but with 9.10 i dont think you can
2009-10-30T05:45:00.000Z	stone1343	randal	maybe so, i haven't tried yet
2009-10-30T05:47:00.000Z	stone1343	randal	you're right it doesn't seem possible
2009-10-30T05:48:00.000Z	randal	stone1343	i like it but the thing i do not like is that you cant switch between them and when omething is maximized you cant see the window decoration
