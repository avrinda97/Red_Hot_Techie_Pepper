2005-11-02T08:41:00.000Z	dooglus	ksmurf	were you planning to use freenx to watch the birth remotely?  how long do we have to get it working?
2005-11-02T08:43:00.000Z	ksmurf	dooglus	Just to mangage things here and upload (which I can do with ssh) to the ftp the video.  I was going to do the editing remotly.  She has been having contractions for 2 days so far.... still 2 Hours apart.
