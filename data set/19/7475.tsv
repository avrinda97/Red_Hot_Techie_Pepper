2008-01-29T21:54:00.000Z	dreamnid	gvsa123	the 755 permission is just specifying who can read/write those cron files
2008-01-29T21:54:00.000Z	dreamnid	gvsa123	since crond is already run by root, it essentially ignores the file permissions

2008-01-29T21:58:00.000Z	gvsa123	dreamnid	not sure if i got this right... and this is also in line with the fact that  it would take root privilege to edit /etc/xxx in the first place
2008-01-29T22:00:00.000Z	dreamnid	gvsa123	right, because the files in /etc/ are owned by root
2008-01-29T22:00:00.000Z	dreamnid		gvas: and only the owner has write permissions
2008-01-29T22:01:00.000Z	gvsa123	dreamnid	ok i get it... but there are cronjobs that are specific for each user only?
2008-01-29T22:01:00.000Z	gvsa123	dreamnid	or are all crontasks done by root?
2008-01-29T22:01:00.000Z	dreamnid		gvas123: Not sure in ubuntu, but usually there is a .cron file in the user's home directory that will execute as that user
2008-01-29T22:01:00.000Z	dreamnid	gvsa123	alternatively, you can edit the /etc/cronttab and specify the user that the command should be run as
2008-01-29T22:02:00.000Z	gvsa123	dreamnid	which is crontab -u username
2008-01-29T22:02:00.000Z	dreamnid	gvsa123	right you are
2008-01-29T22:03:00.000Z	dreamnid		notice that in /etc/crontab , that it will execute all the files in /etc/cron.daily as root
2008-01-29T22:07:00.000Z	gvsa123		so is there a way to know if the cronjobs are actually being done?
2008-01-29T22:07:00.000Z	gvsa123		or should that be a given?
2008-01-29T22:08:00.000Z	dreamnid	gvsa123	it will show up in /var/log/syslog
2008-01-29T22:08:00.000Z	dreamnid	gvsa123	not sure if there is a better place
2008-01-29T22:11:00.000Z	gvsa123	dreamnid	i see... one last thing... cron.daily/monthly/hourly/weekly are what they are obviously... but what about cron.d?
