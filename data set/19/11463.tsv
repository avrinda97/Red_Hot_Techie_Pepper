2006-03-25T09:39:00.000Z	majd		how do i see what my static ip is?
2006-03-25T09:40:00.000Z	intelikey	majd	^
2006-03-25T09:44:00.000Z	majd	intelikey	i get: bash: cd: /dev/hda1: Not a directory
2006-03-25T09:45:00.000Z	intelikey	majd	on what command ?
2006-03-25T09:45:00.000Z	intelikey	majd	try   cd `mount | grep hda1 | cut -d' ' -f3`
2006-03-25T09:49:00.000Z	intelikey	majd	only if you are running services that you need to block net access to
2006-03-25T09:49:00.000Z	majd	intelikey	apache2 counts as one?
2006-03-25T09:50:00.000Z	intelikey	majd	it can.   but if you are only listening on  (what is it 27 ? )  http: then prolly not.
2006-03-25T09:51:00.000Z	intelikey	majd	i'd be more worried about running  sshd ftpd  and the like than httpd   but i'm not a network admin so i don't know.      repete "i don't know."
2006-05-01T08:06:00.000Z	intelikey	majd	close everything that is accessint the mount   then umount it    man fuser
2006-05-01T08:12:00.000Z	intelikey	majd	totem not configured to use  esd ?
2006-05-01T08:13:00.000Z	majd	intelikey	what's esd?
2006-05-01T08:17:00.000Z	intelikey	majd	sure.
2006-05-01T08:18:00.000Z	intelikey	majd	basicly mount it fmask=2 umask=2  iirc
2006-05-01T08:19:00.000Z	majd	intelikey	so "/dev/hda1       /media/hda1     ntfs    defaults,fmask=2 umask=2        0       0"
2006-05-01T08:20:00.000Z	majd	intelikey	would i need to restart the computer?
2006-05-01T08:21:00.000Z	intelikey	majd	no.  just umount and mount the drive.
2006-05-01T08:21:00.000Z	majd	intelikey	but see, the problem is i can't unmount windows.....it says it's busy
2006-05-01T08:22:00.000Z	intelikey	majd	like i said use  fuser and find what is accessing it, kill it.  then umount.   man fuser
