2012-04-23T21:33:00.000Z	Gotestra		Hello anyone
2012-04-23T21:33:00.000Z	Gotestra		Um
2012-04-23T21:33:00.000Z	Gotestra		Newb here.
2012-04-23T21:33:00.000Z	Gotestra		Just starting out with Ubuntu, Linux in fact.
2012-04-23T21:34:00.000Z	Gotestra		So, somebody care to help me out
2012-04-23T21:34:00.000Z	theadmin	Gotestra	1) Don't use Enter as punctuation, 2) Ask your question right away, 3) General chat goes in #ubuntu-offtopic
2012-04-23T21:34:00.000Z	theadmin	Gotestra	Support is here, though.
2012-04-23T21:35:00.000Z	theadmin	Gotestra	Where exactly?
2012-04-23T21:35:00.000Z	theadmin	Gotestra	I mean uh, does it not work in all apps or specific areas?
2012-04-23T21:35:00.000Z	theadmin	Gotestra	That wasn't a yes-no question
2012-04-23T21:37:00.000Z	theadmin	Gotestra	I see, sounds like something to do with the trackpad
2012-04-23T21:38:00.000Z	theadmin	Gotestra	There might be restricted drivers available for your hardware, check it
2012-04-23T21:38:00.000Z	Gotestra	theadmin	I would really appreciate it if you ellaborate more.
2012-04-23T21:38:00.000Z	theadmin	Gotestra	(to do so, visit the "Hardware Drivers" in the main menu)
2012-04-23T21:39:00.000Z	theadmin	Gotestra	Is that where it is now? Haven't seen Ubuntu in a while. But, well, there's... Gah. Hit Ctrl-alt-T, type "gksudo jockey-gtk" in, hit Enter.
2012-04-23T21:41:00.000Z	theadmin	Gotestra	Yeah that'd be it.
2012-04-23T21:41:00.000Z	theadmin	Gotestra	That'd do, yeah, jockey won't work during upgrades
2012-04-23T22:16:00.000Z	theadmin	Gotestra	Don't touch those until you know what you're doing.
2012-04-23T22:17:00.000Z	theadmin	Gotestra	It's mostly source-code -- some tarballs are binary but that's rare. ALWAYS look in the software center before installing anything in a crazy way (tarballs are a crazy way)
