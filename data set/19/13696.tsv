2005-03-26T16:28:00.000Z	apokryphos		Does anyone know of a way to change the default desktop enironment? I'm not talking with gdm/kdm here; the general default. As when one manually enters startx.
2005-03-26T16:30:00.000Z	apokryphos		in Fedora/RedHat the switchdesk command could be used; anything similar in ubuntu?
2005-03-26T16:30:00.000Z	bwlang	apokryphos	what does that command do?
2005-03-26T16:31:00.000Z	apokryphos	bwlang	changes the default desktop environment
2005-03-26T16:32:00.000Z	bwlang	apokryphos	to switch your env to kde you can install kubuntu i think
2005-03-26T16:32:00.000Z	bwlang	apokryphos	they you can make a choice about which one to use at the gdm prompt
2005-03-26T16:33:00.000Z	apokryphos	bwlang	I don't wanna delete any desktop environments, and like I said, I don't mean "change default" as in the gdm/kdm way. Talking about when one manually does startx... the environment that is started then.
2005-03-26T16:34:00.000Z	bwlang	apokryphos	ah ...  you want update-alternatives x-session-manager
2005-03-26T16:35:00.000Z	apokryphos	bwlang	cool; how do I use that?
2005-03-26T16:36:00.000Z	bwlang	apokryphos	just type update-alternatives ... you'll get some usage info there...  eg update-alternatives --config x-session-manager
2005-03-26T16:42:00.000Z	apokryphos	bwlang	that did it; thanks for the help. :)
2005-04-03T12:26:00.000Z	apokryphos	bwlang	Yup, it's great. :)
2005-10-19T08:30:00.000Z	bwlang	apokryphos	that's why i usggested tar...
2005-10-19T08:30:00.000Z	apokryphos	bwlang	why?
2005-10-19T08:30:00.000Z	bwlang	apokryphos	proN00b: tar will automatically do the username conversion
2005-10-19T08:31:00.000Z	apokryphos	bwlang	semi-self-defeating, since a chown takes a matter of seconds.
2005-10-19T08:31:00.000Z	bwlang	apokryphos	not if you have multiple users
2005-10-19T08:31:00.000Z	apokryphos	bwlang	if he had *loads*, then yes, indeed not. I doubt that's the case however.
2005-10-19T08:31:00.000Z	bwlang	apokryphos	especially not if you have a shared directory with different ownership
