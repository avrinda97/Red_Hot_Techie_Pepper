2010-10-28T07:53:00.000Z	furi	sweetpi	do you mean the G keys or the M keys or just regular keys?
2010-10-28T07:53:00.000Z	furi	sweetpi	or should i try them all?
2010-10-28T07:54:00.000Z	furi	sweetpi	tried pressing the M keys and they didn't work
2010-10-28T07:54:00.000Z	sweetpi	furi	just try them all and maybe copy the output(if any)
2010-10-28T07:54:00.000Z	furi	sweetpi	the regular keys get output; if i press 1 and hit G13 they get the EXACT same output
2010-10-28T07:56:00.000Z	sweetpi	furi	youll need a custom program to do that if they dont have drivers for linux
2010-10-28T07:58:00.000Z	sweetpi	furi	it could be done, but a dev would need access to the keyboard.. lookingg at the price, I doubt thats gonna happen
2010-10-28T07:59:00.000Z	furi	sweetpi	that's simply because it's me with the problem; i'm sure if it was someone else, it'd be a lot better simply because it isn't me and my bad luck
2010-10-28T08:00:00.000Z	furi	sweetpi	problems have been stacking up and nobody has helped me with any of them
2010-10-28T08:01:00.000Z	sweetpi	furi	your asking for something that doesnt exist, nobody will be able to help with that unless they are a developer and also have that keyboard
2010-10-28T08:02:00.000Z	furi	sweetpi	but my other problems aren't about HID stuff, and even then, nobody could help
2010-10-28T08:03:00.000Z	sweetpi	furi	like what? maybe try rephrasing the question
2010-10-28T08:03:00.000Z	furi	sweetpi	music-applet
2010-10-28T08:03:00.000Z	furi	sweetpi	well, the other issue is HID

2010-10-28T08:06:00.000Z	sweetpi	furi	If nobody responds to your question, it doesnt mean they are ignoring you. either they dont know the answer or it doesnt interest them. there is also ##linux for more generic linux topics
2010-10-28T08:07:00.000Z	furi	sweetpi	sorry for being so blunt and rude, i'm just fed up
2010-10-28T08:08:00.000Z	furi	sweetpi	to the point of where i'm having second thoughts on installing ubuntu in the first place
