2006-01-04T06:44:00.000Z	skon	Snake__	etherape shows you the traffice from other computers on the network too
2006-01-04T06:46:00.000Z	skon	Snake__	etherape does the job for me, dunno what more you need out of it

2006-01-04T06:53:00.000Z	skon	Snake__	I run it when I bring my laptop to schoola nd I can see all the traffic that every computer in the school has
2006-01-04T06:53:00.000Z	Snake__	skon	Thats because you school uses a hub
2006-01-04T06:53:00.000Z	Snake__	skon	not a router ;)
