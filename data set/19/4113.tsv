2009-12-01T02:25:00.000Z	userone		can i play orginal dvds without libdvdcss2?
2009-12-01T02:25:00.000Z	iceroot	userone	yes, lindvd (non free dvd player)
2009-12-01T02:26:00.000Z	iceroot	userone	lindvd == powerdvd for linux
2009-12-01T02:27:00.000Z	userone	iceroot	thanks, i will check that out. whats the issue with libdvdcss2? is it not open source or restricted in certain countries?
2009-12-01T02:27:00.000Z	iceroot	userone	restricted
2009-12-01T02:27:00.000Z	iceroot	userone	but its working very fine
2009-12-01T02:28:00.000Z	userone	iceroot	ok..thanks for the lindvd tip
2009-12-01T02:28:00.000Z	iceroot	userone	why not using libdvdcss2?
2009-12-01T02:31:00.000Z	userone	iceroot	just trying to use open source (or non-restricted) whenever i can, but I didnt know an open source alternative to libdvdcss2
2009-12-01T02:33:00.000Z	iceroot	userone	lindvd is not open-source :)
2009-12-01T02:34:00.000Z	userone	iceroot	that the problem. also I have a friend who LOVES windows and he bet me GBP 100 i couldn't use ONLY open source software to match his applications. so far i am losing with the dvd player.
2009-12-01T02:35:00.000Z	iceroot	userone	libdvdcss2 is open-source
2009-12-01T02:39:00.000Z	userone	iceroot	ok..so maybe i wont include 'restricted' software as part of the bet :-)
2009-12-01T02:39:00.000Z	iceroot	userone	yes :) good idea
2009-12-01T02:40:00.000Z	userone	iceroot	i have to say, to be fair to my friend, he was blown away when he saw Blender and that it was all open source
2009-12-01T02:41:00.000Z	iceroot	userone	like apache, firefox, mysql, openoffice, linux, open-exchange and so on
2009-12-01T02:41:00.000Z	iceroot	userone	quake3 also
2009-12-01T02:43:00.000Z	userone	iceroot	yeah...he didnt realise that 75% (or more?) of servers in the world run apache, which is open source, and not windows base
2009-12-01T02:43:00.000Z	iceroot	userone	of course :)
