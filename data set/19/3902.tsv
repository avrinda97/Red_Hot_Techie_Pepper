2009-09-11T23:30:00.000Z	fccf	root_	welcome to ubuntu support ... FYI .. It seems you are running your IRC client as root ... THIS IS A MAJOR SECURITY RISK ... you are opening up your system to being hacked
2009-09-11T23:31:00.000Z	root_	fccf	mmmmm im on live cd...
2009-09-11T23:32:00.000Z	root_		if anyone wants to hack me please do so, and fix my laptop while your at it...i cant load GUI, i boot up on tty due to "internal error"

2009-09-11T23:32:00.000Z	fccf	root_	you might want to consider using the alternate install cd
2009-09-11T23:33:00.000Z	root_	fccf	im using backtrack 3 live cd
2009-09-11T23:33:00.000Z	fccf	root_	thats why you are running as root... and backtrack isn't supported here
2009-09-11T23:34:00.000Z	root_	fccf	im running backtrack because my ubuntu crashed, this is the only way for me to resolve my issue with ubuntu
2009-09-11T23:34:00.000Z	root_	fccf	bt3 comes packaged with xchat, which is what im using
2009-09-11T23:35:00.000Z	fccf		root: and the ubuntu live cd? not sure backtrack is going to help you ... we are going to need some details if anybody is going to be able to help you
2009-09-11T23:40:00.000Z	root_	fccf	well my issue is this: last night i updated ubuntu 9.04 by running these two commands - apt-get ugrade & apt-get update...during the update my laptop crashed due to "temperature reached" and ever since, everytime i boot i get this error message saying that it load up x window due to internal error, and then automatically goes in tty
