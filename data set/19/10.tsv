2005-02-08T12:40:00.000Z	mst		argh the security distro is slooooow
2005-02-08T12:40:00.000Z	mdz	mst	a lot of people are downloading the live CD, apparently
2005-02-08T12:41:00.000Z	mdz	mst	we did
2005-02-08T12:41:00.000Z	mst	mdz	oh
2005-02-08T12:45:00.000Z	mst	mdz	how long is the release cycle for livecd?
2005-02-08T12:45:00.000Z	mdz	mst	the same as the install.  we produce daily snapshots, bi-weekly milestones, and 6-month stable releases
2005-02-08T12:46:00.000Z	mdz	mst	sounds like you saved your session with some terminals open
2005-02-08T12:46:00.000Z	mst	mdz	I didn't, it's first install, I havent even completed it yet.
2005-02-08T12:47:00.000Z	mdz	mst	I'm not sure what you mean by terminals, if you haven't installed yet.  you mean virtual consoles (ctrl+alt+f2 etc.)?
2005-02-08T12:47:00.000Z	mst	mdz	yes. X isnt even up yet.
2005-02-08T12:48:00.000Z	mdz	mst	I don't understand what the problem is.  can you explain " annoying when you shift the term left-right"?
2005-02-08T12:49:00.000Z	mst	mdz	I switch the VCs using alt-left/alt right, expecting them to wrap after the last active console to the first one
2005-02-08T12:50:00.000Z	mst	mdz	I still am, logged into another console ;)
2005-02-08T12:50:00.000Z	mst	mdz	is there KDE?
2005-02-08T12:50:00.000Z	mst	mdz	it doesn't spawn getty. It just touches the VC so it remains open.
2005-02-08T12:51:00.000Z	mdz	mst	well, it must have spawned at least one, if you logged in :-)
2005-02-08T12:52:00.000Z	mst	mdz	3 ttys, 6 vcs, so 3 vcs have ttys attached and the other 3 just sit there
2005-02-08T12:53:00.000Z	mst	mdz	annoying but not a factor
2005-02-08T13:43:00.000Z	mdz	mst	on the CD, but not installed, see the FAQ
