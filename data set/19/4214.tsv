2011-06-24T23:47:00.000Z	Yukinoroh		I need help! ubuntu minimal CD install doesn't detect either LAN or wifi... is that normal?
2011-06-24T23:48:00.000Z	Yukinoroh		I've checked the LAN, it is up
2011-06-24T23:48:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Yukinoroh	i had an issue in minimal where it wouldn't see either of my NICs on an EEE 1005
2011-06-24T23:49:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Yukinoroh	there was a different result using 10.04LTS vs 10.10 BTW
2011-06-24T23:50:00.000Z	Yukinoroh	ZykoticK9	really? it's weird, I guess I'm going to stick with mandriva then (last version is more recent than ubuntu 10.04)... at least the minimal install works there :/
2011-06-24T23:53:00.000Z	Yukinoroh	ZykoticK9	I was using 11.04, was it what you tried too?
2011-06-24T23:54:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Yukinoroh	i've never used 11.04 (10.04LTS is the last Ubuntu I'll ever use, i've switched distros now)
2011-06-24T23:54:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Yukinoroh	because of experimenting with Minimal actually - led me to Debian
2011-06-24T23:55:00.000Z	Yukinoroh	ZykoticK9	well what I was looking for with minimal is an install that allowed me to only download the packages I need - I happen to live in one of the three places on earth where internet connection is billed by the gigabyte
2011-06-24T23:57:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Yukinoroh	FYI the ubuntu minimal install is basically a Debian Netinstall, only using ubuntu repos.
2011-07-23T11:32:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Yukinoroh	what game?
2011-07-23T11:32:00.000Z	Yukinoroh	ZykoticK9	mugen
2011-07-23T11:33:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Yukinoroh	have you tried "pasuspender mugen" if mugen is the executable name?
2011-07-23T11:34:00.000Z	Yukinoroh	ZykoticK9	I just tried, doesn't work... looks like these suspenders made the trousers fall as well
2011-07-23T11:35:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Yukinoroh	try "padsp mugen"
2011-07-23T11:38:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Yukinoroh	there's a post in ubuntuforums that suggests trying "alsamixer" and enabling everything.  I got nothing, best of luck.
2011-07-23T11:40:00.000Z	Yukinoroh	ZykoticK9	I don't have much in there
2011-07-23T11:42:00.000Z	Yukinoroh	ZykoticK9	I have master, pcm, s/pdif and beep in alsamixer, master and pcm are 100%, I can't do anything with S/PDIF and honestly I don't think beep can have an effect...
2011-07-23T11:43:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Yukinoroh	sorry, i have no idea.  good luck.
