2008-07-17T04:51:00.000Z	unop	SaGe	simple make a new partition and mount /home/data on that
2008-07-17T04:53:00.000Z	unop	SaGe	you can mount /home/data seperately if you want
2008-07-17T04:54:00.000Z	SaGe	unop	FAJALOU: Okay, so I should be good to just install Ubuntu :D. If i mount a drive to a certain part, nothing is done to the data on it right?
2008-07-17T04:54:00.000Z	unop	SaGe	no
2008-07-17T04:55:00.000Z	unop	SaGe	all the user settings are stored on /home
2008-07-17T04:55:00.000Z	SaGe	unop	is it similar to 'my documents' on windows?
2008-07-17T04:56:00.000Z	unop	SaGe	alsmost, but more like the %userprofile% folder on windows -- i.e.  c:\documents and settings\username\
2008-07-17T04:58:00.000Z	unop	SaGe	errm, it depends -- evolution stores mail there, firefox its cache, other programs might save stuff too -- it could be quite big
2008-07-17T04:59:00.000Z	unop	SaGe	yea, i would say 5 is probably enough, 10 quite generous
2008-07-17T04:59:00.000Z	SaGe	unop	FAJALOU: lol, and what about a swap partiton?
2008-07-17T04:59:00.000Z	unop	SaGe	same amount as your RAM
2008-07-17T05:00:00.000Z	unop	SaGe	or twice if you might be upgrading the amount of RAM you have
2008-07-17T05:00:00.000Z	SaGe	unop	nope won't be upgrading for a while
2008-07-17T05:00:00.000Z	unop	SaGe	it's quite unlikely that you will use 3GB of swap -- although, it helps when you are hibernating
2008-07-17T05:01:00.000Z	SaGe	unop	a feature I never use, though I do play games.
2008-07-17T05:01:00.000Z	unop	SaGe	3GB is fine then
2008-07-17T05:01:00.000Z	unop	SaGe	you could get away with half-that -- but since you have enough space ...
2008-07-17T05:01:00.000Z	SaGe	unop	FAJALOU: Awesome, so I will try that out, hopefully everything goes well :)
2008-07-17T05:01:00.000Z	unop	SaGe	yea, fingers-crossed :) see you on the other side
