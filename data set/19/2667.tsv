2010-02-04T19:17:00.000Z	rcombo		Hi all, has anyone successfully burnt ubuntu 9.10 desktop I keep having "errors found on 2 files" after a disk check run
2010-02-04T19:18:00.000Z	hoonteke	rcombo	yep.  Burnt lots of copies of it.  Are you sure you have an error-free iso?  Consider using torrent to download instead as that will guarantee it's error free
2010-02-04T19:21:00.000Z	rcombo	hoonteke	my last attempt was with a torrent client kget but I ended up with the same result, i'm going through my 4th wasted cd :(
2010-02-04T19:22:00.000Z	hoonteke	rcombo	step 2: consider using cd-rw then, not cd-rs
2010-02-04T19:22:00.000Z	hoonteke	rcombo	also, consider installing to a USB key instead
2010-02-04T19:22:00.000Z	hoonteke		I believe there's a utility in 9.04 called USB Creator.
2010-02-04T19:23:00.000Z	hoonteke	rcombo	it also may be an issue that you're burning too fast for the media.  try burning at a slower speed, like 4x.
2010-02-04T19:24:00.000Z	rcombo		 hoonteke: tx, could be as well the burning speed
2010-02-04T19:24:00.000Z	hoonteke	rcombo	 tx?
2010-02-04T19:25:00.000Z	hoonteke		oh, thanks.  yeesh, spell it out.  :-P
2010-02-04T19:27:00.000Z	rcombo		 hoonteke: I am using a an cd drive emulator when on Xp to test the iso, and it loads ton of error msg
2010-02-04T19:28:00.000Z	hoonteke	rcombo	you're using winxp to test the ISO?  The CD can actually test itself.  Try to boot the current machine with the CD you just burned.  The very first menu you get will give you the option to "Check CD for defects"
2010-02-04T19:28:00.000Z	hoonteke		that will tell you more definitively if youv'e errors, than any emulator in Windows.
2010-02-04T19:29:00.000Z	hoonteke	rcombo	why are you using a drive emulator to begin with?  If you're trying to do a virtual install or test, just use virtual box.
2010-02-04T19:29:00.000Z	hoonteke		http://www.virtualbox.org/
2010-02-04T19:31:00.000Z	rcombo	hoonteke	no I am using both ways, with a drive emulator sometimes and always with self - testing prgm from the cd and both come up with errors
2010-02-04T19:32:00.000Z	hoonteke	rcombo	alright, so you've burn errors.  well, make sure you have a good ISO: boot with it inside of VirtualBox.
2010-02-04T19:32:00.000Z	hoonteke	rcombo	you also might try a different burning program: http://infrarecorder.org/
2010-02-04T19:33:00.000Z	rcombo	hoonteke	alright, gonna try that, tx for your help
