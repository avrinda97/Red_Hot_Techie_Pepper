2006-06-01T15:27:00.000Z	nnz	xanavim	cant update to archive. or gs.archive  says connection failed
2006-06-01T15:27:00.000Z	xanavim	nnz	can you ping the servers that you put in your repos?
2006-06-01T15:27:00.000Z	nnz	xanavim	yes , i can wget files from them
2006-06-01T15:28:00.000Z	xanavim	nnz	try removing some of the repos one by one until it works, then put them back in again one by one until you find the problem one
2006-06-01T15:28:00.000Z	xanavim	nnz	you can also try different mirrors
2006-06-01T15:30:00.000Z	xanavim	nnz	try changing your mirrors
2006-06-01T15:30:00.000Z	nnz	xanavim	to which?
2006-06-01T15:33:00.000Z	xanavim	nnz	did you sudo apt-get update?
2006-06-01T15:35:00.000Z	xanavim	nnz	are you able to curl the files you need?
2006-06-01T15:35:00.000Z	nnz	xanavim	is there any difference between curl n wget?
2006-06-01T15:35:00.000Z	xanavim	nnz	not sure
2006-06-01T15:36:00.000Z	xanavim	nnz	hmmm... sounds like you still have some configuration of the repos to do
2006-06-01T15:43:00.000Z	xanavim	nnz	to leave a potential security hole closed
2006-06-01T15:45:00.000Z	xanavim	nnz	compare your sources.list to this: http://pastebin.com/752263
