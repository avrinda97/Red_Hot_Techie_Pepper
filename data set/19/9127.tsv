2006-12-24T10:45:00.000Z	kitche	Joker_	type mount and pastebin what is mounted
2006-12-24T10:46:00.000Z	Joker_	kitche	Where do you want me to paste it to you?
2006-12-24T10:46:00.000Z	kitche	Joker_	just rememebr to paste the link
2006-12-24T10:48:00.000Z	Joker_	kitche	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/38617/
2006-12-24T10:49:00.000Z	kitche	Joker_	/dev/hda1 is your root filesystem why would you umount it?
2006-12-24T10:49:00.000Z	Joker_	kitche	Did I?
2006-12-24T10:50:00.000Z	Joker_	kitche	No, that's just what wiseelben told me to do
2006-12-24T10:50:00.000Z	kitche	Joker_	no but you trying to mount a FAT system well /dev/hda1 is not a FAT filesystem
2006-12-24T10:51:00.000Z	Joker_	kitche	Ah... Makes sense... Someone might want to go edit http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Edgy#How_to_mount.2Funmount_Windows_partitions_.28FAT.29_manually.2C_and_allow_all_users_to_read.2Fwrite then
2006-12-24T10:52:00.000Z	Joker_	kitche	Because I was just doing what it said to do
2006-12-24T10:52:00.000Z	kitche	Joker_	let em check it might say sda1 instead
2006-12-24T10:52:00.000Z	Joker_	kitche	So put sudo mount /dev/sda1 /media/windows/ -t vfat -o iocharset=utf8,umask=000 into the terminal?
2006-12-24T10:53:00.000Z	kitche	Joker_	hmm no that's probably right for what it's for, sicne iwndows likes to be the first partition usually but it does need clarification
2006-12-24T10:53:00.000Z	kitche	Joker_	you mounting a USB drive or another partition?
2006-12-24T10:53:00.000Z	Joker_	kitche	In Dapper I had it as hdd1
2006-12-24T10:53:00.000Z	Joker_	kitche	It's a seperate hard disk
2006-12-24T10:54:00.000Z	kitche	Joker_	it might be hdd1 still but it might be /dev/hdb1
2006-12-24T10:56:00.000Z	Joker_	kitche	I love you now. Will you marry me?
2006-12-24T10:57:00.000Z	Joker_	kitche	That's the drive I've got all of my music on
