2005-10-20T07:14:00.000Z	ryanduff		i dont' remember setting a root pw during setup, was i sleeping or am i correct?
2005-10-20T07:15:00.000Z	ryanduff		i tried what i *would* have set it to if prompted but it didn't work
2005-10-20T07:15:00.000Z	narnian	ryanduff	ubuntu uses "sudo" to perform admin role
2005-10-20T07:15:00.000Z	narnian	ryanduff	why you can't hack root then ;-)
2005-10-20T07:16:00.000Z	narnian	ryanduff	no root password means no one can login as root
2005-10-20T07:17:00.000Z	narnian	ryanduff	the first user (you) by default has the knowledge to have root priveleges
2005-10-20T07:18:00.000Z	narnian	ryanduff	doesn't use lilo - uses grub
2005-10-20T07:18:00.000Z	narnian	ryanduff	/boot/grub/menu.lst is prob what you want
2005-10-20T07:18:00.000Z	ryanduff	narnian	thanks
2005-10-20T07:20:00.000Z	narnian	ryanduff	just make a copy a of the existing menu entry - that why you don't chop off your leg!
2005-10-20T07:20:00.000Z	narnian	ryanduff	you can also edit the kernel params for test puposes at the grub prompt
2005-10-20T07:21:00.000Z	ryanduff	narnian	ok
2005-10-20T07:27:00.000Z	ryanduff	narnian	def said lilo on boot, not grub
2005-10-20T07:28:00.000Z	narnian	ryanduff	you didn't find /etc/lilo.conf then?
2005-10-20T07:29:00.000Z	narnian	ryanduff	dpkg --listfiles lilo
2005-10-20T07:37:00.000Z	ryanduff	narnian	i found it, edited it, then vi crapped out on me and the computer just started to beep at me for about a minute before i pressed the reset button
2005-10-20T07:38:00.000Z	narnian	ryanduff	???
2005-10-20T07:39:00.000Z	ryanduff	narnian	what i'm thinking exactly
2005-10-20T07:40:00.000Z	narnian	ryanduff	try again i guess (and don't leave fingers pushing on the spacebar ;-) )
