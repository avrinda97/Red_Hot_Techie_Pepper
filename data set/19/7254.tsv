2007-09-23T14:23:00.000Z	MrPink	bascule	Thanks!
2007-09-27T05:32:00.000Z	bascule	MrPink	i assume the rectangle is where the progree bar used to be(?)
2007-09-27T05:33:00.000Z	MrPink	bascule	no both progress bars (there are two for this theme) are visible
2007-09-27T05:33:00.000Z	MrPink	bascule	As far as I remember it is really a background image file that is missing
2007-09-27T05:33:00.000Z	bascule	MrPink	oh well, no idea reaally, boot themes are not something I really know much about
2007-09-27T05:34:00.000Z	MrPink	bascule	The weird thing is that the image is identical to the image that is then displayed seconds later in the Login Screen... so when I enter username & password...
2007-09-27T05:35:00.000Z	bascule	MrPink	all framebuffer related I guess and i just saw the AncientRelic post so here's hoping
2007-09-27T05:54:00.000Z	bascule	MrPink	you can set colour depths in console
2007-09-27T05:54:00.000Z	bascule	MrPink	vga=??? option to kernel via grub
2007-09-27T05:54:00.000Z	MrPink	bascule	I tried to do so in the startup manager... it was set to 8 bit and I tried setting it to 16 bit... didn't help
2007-09-27T05:55:00.000Z	MrPink	bascule	Lol you might as well could have spoken in chinese... :D  Can you explain what you mean? ^^

2007-09-27T06:00:00.000Z	MrPink	bascule	And you think it is the resolution that screwed up the iamge? And how do I find out what the right settings are?
2007-09-27T06:01:00.000Z	bascule	MrPink	I have never messed with boot spalshes so I dunno
