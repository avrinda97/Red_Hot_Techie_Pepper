2008-01-18T18:06:00.000Z	pkundu	misslecommander	i have extracted the ubuntu live cd iso to my usb stick. but my system dont boot from it
2008-01-18T18:07:00.000Z	pkundu	misslecommander	do i need to do anything to make the usb stick bootable
2008-01-18T18:07:00.000Z	misslecommander	pkundu	does your motherboard allow for boot from USB device ?
2008-01-18T18:07:00.000Z	misslecommander	pkundu	in bios/cmos when you first power up your computer, in the settings some boards have option to boot USB
2008-01-18T18:07:00.000Z	pkundu	misslecommander	yes it does
2008-01-18T18:08:00.000Z	misslecommander	pkundu	if you know how to reverse anything you do in there, put USB first
2008-01-18T18:08:00.000Z	pkundu	misslecommander	i have change the boot option in bios too
2008-01-18T18:08:00.000Z	misslecommander	pkundu	when it tells you to remove CD you remove USB before post
2008-01-18T18:09:00.000Z	misslecommander	pkundu	i dont know it will install with USB, i cant be sure Linux will let you
2008-01-18T18:10:00.000Z	misslecommander	pkundu	just know how to reverse anythign you do in CMOS
2008-01-18T18:14:00.000Z	misslecommander	pkundu	it was a mere suggestion, it cant hurt to try. at most it wont work, you are out nothing
2008-01-18T18:16:00.000Z	misslecommander	pkundu	do you have Linux already installed and you are trying to re-install or recover a bad install ?
2008-01-18T18:25:00.000Z	pkundu	misslecommander	my total laptop is broken. I want to install a fresh
2008-01-18T18:26:00.000Z	misslecommander	pkundu	i am no Linux pro, but i do know hardware. ask ikonia, he seems to know
2008-01-18T18:27:00.000Z	misslecommander	pkundu	you have 2 or more computers ?
