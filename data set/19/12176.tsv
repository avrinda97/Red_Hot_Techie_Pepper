2007-03-18T08:28:00.000Z	jrr		is the text-based installer still available (6.10 disc)
2007-03-18T08:28:00.000Z	Flannel	jrr	Yes.  On the Alternate CD.  The desktop CD is *only* a live CD
2007-03-18T08:28:00.000Z	jrr	Flannel	D=
2007-03-18T08:29:00.000Z	Flannel	jrr	Use the alternate CD to install.
2007-03-18T08:30:00.000Z	jrr	Flannel	where do i find it?
2007-03-18T08:30:00.000Z	Flannel	jrr	on the download page.  For edgy, youll have to get past the facade, with "More Installation Options"
2007-03-18T08:31:00.000Z	jrr	Flannel	found it, thanks
2007-06-16T13:08:00.000Z	Flannel	jrr	_Andrew, you can use apt-get as long as you take a few precautions beforehand (basically, if you know what update-manager does, you can do it manually)
2007-06-16T13:09:00.000Z	jrr	Flannel	what's update-manager do?
2007-06-16T13:09:00.000Z	Flannel	jrr	makes sure you have proper metapackages installed for one.  It also automatically switches your repositories.  Do you have any third party repositories?
2007-06-16T13:10:00.000Z	jrr	Flannel	no third parties
2007-06-16T13:10:00.000Z	Flannel	jrr	Alright, so, you're running Ubuntu? or Kubuntu? or what?
2007-06-16T13:10:00.000Z	jrr	Flannel	i have dapper, and want to get to feisty
2007-06-16T13:11:00.000Z	Flannel	jrr	Hmm.  Ok, to go from dapper to feisty you need to go dapper to edgy, then edgy to feisty.  This should be fine.  Just use normal ssh, no GUI, we don't need it.
2008-08-30T08:17:00.000Z	Flannel	jrr	parted can.  You just need to have the partition unmounted, so you probably need a liveCD
2008-08-30T08:17:00.000Z	Flannel	jrr	And if you're using a liveCD, might as well use gparted, since the GUI is a lot easier
2008-08-30T08:17:00.000Z	jrr	Flannel	it complains about an unsupported ext3 feature, and somebody in #parted said the ext3 support is not up to date
2008-08-30T08:18:00.000Z	Flannel	jrr	Ah, well, they'd know more than I would
2008-08-30T08:18:00.000Z	jrr	Flannel	thanks anyway =]
