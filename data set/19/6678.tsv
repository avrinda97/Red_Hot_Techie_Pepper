2008-07-26T03:56:00.000Z	linuxfce		The worst part of all is, nvidia doesn't restrict overclocking for this GPU in windows, ONLY in linux.
2008-07-26T03:57:00.000Z	Drk_Guy	linuxfce	Coolbits is not completely ported to linux, i'm sure they'll enhance it soon
2008-07-26T03:58:00.000Z	linuxfce	Drk_Guy	it says that it is disabled in Mobile GPU's, I dont think it's an enahancement issue, because underclocking functions just fine ;)
2008-07-26T03:58:00.000Z	Drk_Guy	linuxfce	did you enable coolbits on xorg.confP?
2008-07-26T03:58:00.000Z	linuxfce	Drk_Guy	yes this is how I know overclocking doesn't work, and underclocking does.
2008-07-26T03:59:00.000Z	Drk_Guy	linuxfce	nvclock pwns for overclocking nv cards
2008-07-26T03:59:00.000Z	linuxfce	Drk_Guy	nvclock does not work for me, it says the clocks have been changed, but the clocks are never changed.
2008-07-26T03:59:00.000Z	Drk_Guy	linuxfce	what do you use then?
2008-07-26T04:00:00.000Z	linuxfce	Drk_Guy	I dont use, nothing works. I have been trying for days.
2008-07-26T04:00:00.000Z	Drk_Guy	linuxfce	Why you want to overclock that hard?
2008-07-26T04:01:00.000Z	Drk_Guy	linuxfce	fusion-icon, compiz options, indirect rendering works like a charm
2008-07-26T04:01:00.000Z	Drk_Guy	linuxfce	it gives a 2x FPS boost here
2008-07-26T04:01:00.000Z	linuxfce	Drk_Guy	not on this card, not with powermizer enabled.
2008-07-26T04:02:00.000Z	Drk_Guy	linuxfce	how do i check if powermizer is enabled?
2008-07-26T04:02:00.000Z	linuxfce	Drk_Guy	nvidia-settings
2008-07-26T04:03:00.000Z	linuxfce	Drk_Guy	Powermizer is always taking my 400/600 stock and dropping it to 169/100. Try running CF on that.
2008-07-26T04:03:00.000Z	Drk_Guy	linuxfce	go to my pm
2008-07-29T04:30:00.000Z	Drk_Guy	linuxfce	I've pm'ed you
2008-07-29T04:31:00.000Z	Drk_Guy	linuxfce	I got your solution
