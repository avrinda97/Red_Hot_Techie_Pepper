2006-04-11T06:03:00.000Z	Xenguy	ubuntu872	I don't know proftpd, but I hear vsftpd is easier to configure, and it is more lightweight

2006-04-11T06:06:00.000Z	Xenguy	ubuntu872	I have a document that outlines everything (anonymous, login, etc.); I can offer you that (I have deadlines tonight, so not much time) if you are interested
2006-04-11T06:07:00.000Z	Xenguy	ubuntu872	I can DCC it, or I can otherwise make it available to you.  Do you know DCC via IRC?
2006-04-11T06:08:00.000Z	Xenguy	ubuntu872	what is your IRC client?
2006-04-11T06:08:00.000Z	Xenguy	ubuntu872	OK, give me a minute to find this doc - sec...
2006-04-11T06:12:00.000Z	Xenguy	ubuntu872	Do you see a file incoming in your xchat?
2006-04-11T06:12:00.000Z	Xenguy	ubuntu872	tell me when you have accepted it, and successfully retrieved it
2006-04-11T06:13:00.000Z	Xenguy	ubuntu872	it is a PDF file for configuring vsftpd, as discussed
2006-04-11T06:13:00.000Z	Xenguy	ubuntu872	it looks from here as if you got it OK

2006-04-11T06:15:00.000Z	Xenguy	ubuntu872	ignore the installation stuff; the rest should be relevant and good info
2006-04-11T06:15:00.000Z	Xenguy	ubuntu872	install with apt-get or synaptic of course
2006-04-11T06:16:00.000Z	Xenguy	ubuntu872	hrm, do you actually have the file?
