2007-02-16T16:56:00.000Z	fong	unop	so basically 3-4GB is for the system files only?
2007-02-16T16:51:00.000Z	unop	fong	 i'd add on another gigabyte if i were you
2007-02-16T16:52:00.000Z	fong	unop	what should be the division of the partitions?
2007-02-16T16:52:00.000Z	unop	fong	 i'm not sure i follow? you mean order or size or what?
2007-02-16T16:52:00.000Z	fong	unop	i meant, like for 3 GB, 2GB for hd space(ext3) and another 1GB for swap?
2007-02-16T16:54:00.000Z	unop	fong	.. at a minimum -- / - 3-4GB , swap @ 2xRAM and whatever else you can afford for /home
2007-02-16T16:57:00.000Z	unop	fong	 yes, indeed
2007-02-16T17:02:00.000Z	unop	fong	 do you have a windows partition too?
2007-02-16T17:02:00.000Z	fong	unop	yes.
2007-02-16T17:03:00.000Z	unop	fong	 i have seen some dual-booters place their /home on their ntfs partition so that they have all their document from both installs placed in c:\documents and settings\%username%\ ..
2007-02-16T17:03:00.000Z	unop	fong	 how much memory do you have?
2007-02-16T17:03:00.000Z	fong	unop	just 512MB
2007-02-16T17:04:00.000Z	unop	fong	 you could do this 3.5GB for / and .5GB for swap then .. it'll work
2007-02-16T17:04:00.000Z	fong	unop	then for home, it would be shared with the win partition?
2007-02-16T17:05:00.000Z	unop	fong	 but thats a very conservative setup, you probably will run out of space if you install quite a lot
2007-02-16T17:06:00.000Z	unop	fong	 initially you dont have to worry about /home .. it will be created as a folder under / .. once you have installed ubuntu and then installed ntfs-3g .. you can move /home over to your windows partition and mount it as /home
2007-02-16T17:08:00.000Z	unop	fong	what i think would be a little better tho is to mount the windows parition as /media/windows .. and have /home point to /media/windows/"documents and settings"/$yourusername/
2007-02-16T17:08:00.000Z	unop	fong	 sorry, /home pointing to /media/windows/"documents and settings"/
2007-02-16T17:10:00.000Z	fong	unop	ok thats a good suggestion... will definitely consider it.
