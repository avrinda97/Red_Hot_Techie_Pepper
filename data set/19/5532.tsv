2008-06-11T01:35:00.000Z	Sexygurl		I have a program trying to use a binary called C++ to compile, but I can't find any tool named C++ in the repositories, help please?
2008-06-11T01:35:00.000Z	Sexygurl		Where could I find this tool?
2008-06-11T01:36:00.000Z	ompaul	Sexygurl	sudo apt-get install build-essential <<< do that and you will get C++ and lots more
2008-06-11T01:36:00.000Z	Sexygurl	ompaul	oh... I thought I already had it...
2008-06-11T01:36:00.000Z	ompaul	Sexygurl	obviously no
2008-06-11T01:37:00.000Z	ompaul	Sexygurl	^^ see wols_ comment
2008-06-11T01:42:00.000Z	ompaul	Sexygurl	what are you trying to compile?
2008-06-11T01:42:00.000Z	Sexygurl	ompaul	a little Cairo demo program.
2008-06-11T01:43:00.000Z	Sexygurl	ompaul	it's called cairo-in-motion.
2008-06-11T01:45:00.000Z	ompaul	Sexygurl	I can't find a libsvg-cairo  so I suggest you check out what is around using apt-cache search libsvg and cairo and see if it works for you
2008-06-11T01:49:00.000Z	Sexygurl	ompaul	I didn't find it.
2008-06-11T01:49:00.000Z	ompaul	Sexygurl	as I said I did not find it but you might find something there
2008-06-11T01:50:00.000Z	Sexygurl	ompaul	it wasn't in the cache. I think I'll check the cairo website.
2008-06-11T01:50:00.000Z	ompaul	Sexygurl	that would be a good idea
2008-06-11T01:51:00.000Z	Sexygurl	ompaul	actually Google found it for me... I should have done that first, but how do I install it? :o
2008-06-11T01:52:00.000Z	Sexygurl	ompaul	why do I have to compile it? X( can't I just drop it in some directory?
2008-06-11T01:52:00.000Z	ompaul	Sexygurl	it looks like a lib and being part of something else read the read me on it
2008-06-11T01:53:00.000Z	ompaul	Sexygurl	 consider this place as a signpost towards a solution we may not know exactly what it is you need but we most likely know which road you need to walk
2008-06-11T01:53:00.000Z	Sexygurl	ompaul	haha, alright. :D
