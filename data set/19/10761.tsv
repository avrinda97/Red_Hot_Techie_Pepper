2006-07-13T07:54:00.000Z	viator		error 17?
2006-07-13T07:55:00.000Z	viator		make sure in your bios that its not set on auto that it has your harddrive listed instead of auto
2006-07-13T07:55:00.000Z	viator		got a usb drive?
2006-07-13T07:55:00.000Z	squidgy	viator	 yes, "Grub error 17", with no additional info.  I haven't made any BIOS or grub changes, except that I updated to a newer kernel.
2006-07-13T07:56:00.000Z	squidgy	viator	 I do.  This *is* the first time I've booted with the external usb drive plugged in.
2006-07-13T07:56:00.000Z	viator		try unplugging the usb
2006-07-13T07:57:00.000Z	squidgy	viator	 it hadn't occurred to me, but that's probably it.  Will the BIOS change eliminate this problem in the future, enabling me to boot with the external HD plugged in?
2006-07-13T07:57:00.000Z	viator		most likely :)
2006-07-13T07:58:00.000Z	squidgy	viator	 Many thanks.  I'll go try this now (I have to reboot since I'm typing from a livecd on the same system.)
2006-07-13T07:58:00.000Z	viator		goodluck
2006-07-13T07:58:00.000Z	squidgy	viator	 adios.

2006-07-13T08:08:00.000Z	squidgy	viator	 unplugging the USB drive worked, so I'm back in business.  Thanks again.  Oddly enough, there seems to be no relevant BIOS settings.  The only that even refer to HDs are "enable SATA", the boot order menu, and a drive test menu.  Do you know of another non-BIOS way to avoid having to unplug my USB drives when I boot?
