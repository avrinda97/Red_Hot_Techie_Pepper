2007-04-10T08:11:00.000Z	cocacola681		yeah-- I hit ctrl-alt-f1 (i think that is what you had said) and i got a text screen, then some messages saying a bunch of services were shutting down, then the system hung
2007-04-10T08:11:00.000Z	cocacola681		well i never made it into terminal
2007-04-10T08:11:00.000Z	cocacola681		the thing is, i'm now booted off of the cd and am not sure how to access my ubuntu file structure on the hdd
2007-04-10T08:12:00.000Z	cocacola681		i've got a terminal up now and ran sudo nano with no probs
2007-04-10T08:12:00.000Z	cocacola681		but how do i load the relevant xconf file on my hdd?
2007-04-10T08:13:00.000Z	cocacola681		okay, let me ask you this before i try learning something more new: is there a way to simply start from scratch with feisty-- before I screwed it all up?  when i try to install again from the cd, it wants to further partition my hdd rather than just installing over the partition it already made for ubuntu
2007-04-10T08:14:00.000Z	zulfajuniadi	cocacola681	use the manual partitioning
2007-04-10T08:14:00.000Z	zulfajuniadi	cocacola681	or are you using the live cd?
2007-04-10T08:30:00.000Z	zulfajuniadi	cocacola681	what was the X error? the to find it, there's like a blue screen appear when X can't load right? try finding the culprit there
2007-04-10T08:45:00.000Z	zulfajuniadi	cocacola681	try the nvidia settings, download it @ synaptic
2007-04-10T08:46:00.000Z	cocacola681	zulfajuniadi	try nvidia even though the card i've got is an ati radeon?
2007-04-10T08:46:00.000Z	zulfajuniadi	cocacola681	sorry, my mistake,
2007-04-10T08:48:00.000Z	zulfajuniadi	cocacola681	have you tried manually configuring your xorg.conf?
2007-04-10T08:50:00.000Z	zulfajuniadi	cocacola681	in the screen section, subsection display, depth 24 modes "1680x1050"
2007-04-10T08:55:00.000Z	zulfajuniadi	cocacola681	alt + ctrl + backspc
2007-04-10T08:57:00.000Z	zulfajuniadi	cocacola681	pastebin your xorg.conf please.
2007-04-10T08:58:00.000Z	zulfajuniadi	cocacola681	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/
2007-04-10T09:01:00.000Z	zulfajuniadi	cocacola681	vesa drivers doesn't support your resolution. install the ati driver
2007-04-10T09:02:00.000Z	zulfajuniadi	cocacola681	try googling easyubuntu
