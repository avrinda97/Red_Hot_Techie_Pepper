2008-10-19T10:51:00.000Z	mokz		hi all, i need to update my pidgin, what version should i download ? for windows, for source or ?
2008-10-19T10:51:00.000Z	adam7	mokz	do they have a .deb?
2008-10-19T10:53:00.000Z	mokz	adam7	i dont know ? i just visited their site and there were different versions
2008-10-19T10:53:00.000Z	adam7	mokz	can you compile stuff? if you can, use the source. Otherwise, you need to find a debian package. There is one in the intrepid repos, and getdeb.net has one.
2008-10-19T10:55:00.000Z	adam7	mokz	Debian is a Linux distro?
2008-10-19T10:57:00.000Z	adam7	mokz	it's a lot easier just to grab a .deb for it
2008-10-19T10:58:00.000Z	adam7	mokz	7.10 or 7.04?
2008-10-19T10:59:00.000Z	adam7	mokz	cat /etc/issue (run that in a terminal)
2008-10-19T11:03:00.000Z	adam7	mokz	double click it
2008-10-19T11:03:00.000Z	adam7	mokz	should be automatic
2008-10-19T11:04:00.000Z	adam7	mokz	not sure where you'll find a deb for 7.10 though
2008-10-19T11:04:00.000Z	adam7	mokz	it's not hard to compile, if that fails
2008-10-19T11:06:00.000Z	adam7	mokz	well, what are you running?
2008-10-19T11:06:00.000Z	adam7	mokz	run uname -a
2008-10-19T11:07:00.000Z	adam7	mokz	32
2008-10-19T11:10:00.000Z	adam7	mokz	Linux mydesktop 2.6.27-7-generic #1 SMP Tue Oct 14 18:38:59 UTC 2008 x86_64 GNU/Linux
2008-10-19T11:10:00.000Z	adam7	mokz	that's for 64
2008-10-19T11:12:00.000Z	adam7	mokz	getdeb.net only has them for 8.04 I think
2008-10-19T11:12:00.000Z	adam7	mokz	you can try it, though. Just download them all
