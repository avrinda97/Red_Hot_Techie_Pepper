2007-08-24T10:35:00.000Z	IcemanV9	charlie	how did you install madwifi? just remove it like sudo apt-get remove madwifi??
2007-08-24T10:37:00.000Z	charlie	IcemanV9	frustratingly, i cant exactly remember
2007-08-24T10:38:00.000Z	charlie	IcemanV9	is there some option, or script or something i can to to install the original drivers
2007-08-24T10:39:00.000Z	IcemanV9	charlie	hmm. let me see ... in your terminal, grep madwifi /var/log/dpkg
2007-08-24T10:39:00.000Z	charlie	IcemanV9	no such file or directory
2007-08-24T10:40:00.000Z	charlie	IcemanV9	i also tried install ndiswrap afterwards
2007-08-24T10:40:00.000Z	IcemanV9	charlie	I am sorry. grep madwifi /var/log/dpkg.log
2007-08-24T10:46:00.000Z	IcemanV9	charlie	were you able to open synaptic?
2007-08-24T10:47:00.000Z	IcemanV9	charlie	then untick those and it will be removed
2007-08-24T10:48:00.000Z	charlie	IcemanV9	ok, then do i need to install something else?
2007-08-24T10:48:00.000Z	IcemanV9	charlie	what kind of wireless card do you have?
2007-08-24T10:49:00.000Z	charlie	IcemanV9	its on a laptop
2007-08-24T10:51:00.000Z	IcemanV9	charlie	i have an atheros card and it works out of the box since breezy
2007-08-24T10:52:00.000Z	charlie	IcemanV9	yeah mine worked out of the box too, but i got poor signal strenght all the time, and often couldnt connect at all, so i tried installing other drivers
2007-08-24T10:55:00.000Z	IcemanV9	charlie	hope you were able to remove madwifi? if so, then you need to restart the network i believe to get the original wireless driver back up and running.
2007-08-24T10:55:00.000Z	charlie	IcemanV9	i think i have removed it, how do i restart the network?
2007-08-24T10:59:00.000Z	charlie	IcemanV9	how do i go about restarting my network?
