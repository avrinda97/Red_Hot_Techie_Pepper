2008-12-08T08:42:00.000Z	unop	SJrX	it kinda makes sense - write speeds are generally much much lower than read speeds - especially from USB devices -- also, reading from /dev/{zero,null} is much faster than /dev/urandom  by virtue of how /dev/urandom works
2008-12-08T08:42:00.000Z	SJrX		um
2008-12-08T08:43:00.000Z	SJrX	unop	yes but why is it faster for me to write from /dev/urandom then /dev/zero
2008-12-08T08:43:00.000Z	unop	SJrX	what's unusual tho is the 500K/s write speeds you get
2008-12-08T08:43:00.000Z	SJrX		Yeah
2008-12-08T08:43:00.000Z	SJrX		the /dev/urandom 2.7 MB/s is the bottleneck of /dev/urandom
2008-12-08T08:44:00.000Z	unop	SJrX	you said - /dev/zero gives you ~27 MB/s - that's faster than urandom
2008-12-08T08:44:00.000Z	SJrX		Yeah
2008-12-08T08:44:00.000Z	unop	SJrX	i don't get it - what are you asking really? :)
2008-12-08T08:45:00.000Z	SJrX		zero -> sdb is 500 KB/s. zero -> null is 27.8 MB/s. urandom -> sdb is 2.8 MB/s, urandom -> null is 2.8 MB/s
2008-12-08T08:45:00.000Z	SJrX		For some reason zero -> sdb is REALLY slow
2008-12-08T08:46:00.000Z	unop	SJrX	have you played with the blocksizes?
2008-12-08T08:46:00.000Z	SJrX		no
2008-12-08T08:47:00.000Z	unop	SJrX	try increasing the blocksizes --   dd ... bd=16384
2008-12-08T08:47:00.000Z	unop	SJrX	err,  dd ... bs=16384
2008-12-08T08:47:00.000Z	unop		!gksudo | fosco_ , obi_
2008-12-08T08:48:00.000Z	SJrX		that seems to work unop, which is weird I did this three weeks ago without bs, and it's fine
2008-12-08T08:48:00.000Z	SJrX		Now I'm getting 9.04 MB/s, except it's dropping really fast
2008-12-08T08:49:00.000Z	unop	SJrX	might be drive caching at play there
