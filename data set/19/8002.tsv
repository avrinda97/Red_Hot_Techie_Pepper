2007-07-05T11:57:00.000Z	orbisvicis		is powernowd (cpu freq manager) required to sleep a computer ?
2007-07-05T11:58:00.000Z	troxor	orbisvicis	nope, sleep is an acpi thing, iirc
2007-07-05T12:00:00.000Z	troxor	orbisvicis	how did you disable sleep?
2007-07-05T12:01:00.000Z	orbisvicis	troxor	system -> prefs -> power managements -> on ac power (desktop pc) -> put computer/display to sleep -> never
2007-07-05T12:03:00.000Z	orbisvicis	troxor	does that work, or should i also disable acpid ?
2007-07-05T12:03:00.000Z	troxor	orbisvicis	maybe powersaved?
2007-07-05T12:04:00.000Z	troxor	orbisvicis	you can really stop sleep by appending noacpi to your kernel boot line in grub ;)
2007-07-05T12:04:00.000Z	orbisvicis	troxor	its not sleeping, i dont think ... just freezing
2007-07-05T12:05:00.000Z	troxor	orbisvicis	weird, and you don't know what's causing it? any log messages?
2007-07-05T12:05:00.000Z	orbisvicis	troxor	no
2007-07-05T12:06:00.000Z	troxor	orbisvicis	maybe it might be wise to append the noacpi thing anyways :)
2007-07-05T12:06:00.000Z	troxor	orbisvicis	unfortunately, random freezes are difficult to diagnose
2007-07-05T12:06:00.000Z	orbisvicis	troxor	how does powernowd work (if it kicks in ~2-3 hr after no use, it could be the cause)
2007-07-05T12:09:00.000Z	troxor	orbisvicis	nah
2007-07-05T12:09:00.000Z	orbisvicis	troxor	does powernowd kick in immediately, or does it take time ?
2007-07-05T12:31:00.000Z	troxor	orbisvicis	/etc/acpi/events ?
2007-07-05T12:34:00.000Z	orbisvicis	troxor	is acpi suspend different than kernel-suspend ?
2007-07-05T12:36:00.000Z	troxor	orbisvicis	hmm, kernel-suspend?
2007-07-05T12:39:00.000Z	orbisvicis	troxor	how do I disable kernel suspend ?
