2007-02-27T09:54:00.000Z	Pelo	whileimhere	 just backup your home folder, and you won' t need to redo any of your config, just re install the apps
2007-04-16T08:08:00.000Z	Pelo	whileimhere	 beryl is eye candy,  menu animations, transparent borders and stuff like that,  if you want to know what it looks like do a search on youtube there are loads of videos

2007-10-11T07:29:00.000Z	Pelo	whileimhere	check the model here and in the forum  www.ubuntuforums.org  https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupport
2007-10-11T07:37:00.000Z	Pelo	whileimhere	 try lspci in the terminal , it might tell you something but I can't garranty
2007-10-11T07:38:00.000Z	whileimhere	Pelo	it unfortunatly tells me very little.
2007-10-11T07:39:00.000Z	Pelo	whileimhere	menu > system > prefs > hardware info, it will tell you a lot more, or a lot less depending on how you look at it
2007-10-11T07:39:00.000Z	whileimhere	Pelo	okay
2008-03-18T03:05:00.000Z	Pelo	whileimhere	might be the image ratio, I suggest you inquire in #vlc

2008-03-18T03:08:00.000Z	Pelo	whileimhere	 yes, just drop them in that themes folder in the emblem subfolder , for each size, you also need to give it a txt files,  see the content of the emblem folder for more info, it's pretty selfexplanaroty
2008-03-18T03:09:00.000Z	whileimhere	Pelo	What I should have asked is where can I get them? I have checked www.gnome-look.org already.
2008-03-18T03:09:00.000Z	Pelo	whileimhere	no answer there,  you can possibly grab some from other icon thems and give them other names
2008-03-18T03:26:00.000Z	Pelo	whileimhere	 not unless they make a deb package
