2007-02-08T13:42:00.000Z	pipegeek		howdy, folks.  I have kind of a stupid question: is there some way to print out the current operating system version?  uname doesn't do what I want; I want scripts that recognize whether they're running in ubuntu or debian, since I share a home directory between the two.
2007-02-08T13:42:00.000Z	soundray	pipegeek	lsb_release
2007-02-08T13:43:00.000Z	soundray	pipegeek	you can also check for /etc/lsb-release and /etc/redhat-release
2007-02-08T13:44:00.000Z	pipegeek	soundray	thanks loads
2007-04-28T15:06:00.000Z	soundray	pipegeek	/var/log/installer/
2007-04-28T15:06:00.000Z	pipegeek	soundray	Good to know.  Thanks.
2007-05-01T11:38:00.000Z	soundray	pipegeek	'man smbclient' mentions a -p port option...
2007-05-01T11:39:00.000Z	pipegeek	soundray	right, but I'm trying to connect through gnome.  Command-line options aren't an option
2007-05-01T11:39:00.000Z	pipegeek	soundray	unless it's possible to specify the command gnome-vfs uses for smb:// URLs
2007-05-01T11:40:00.000Z	soundray	pipegeek	it's probably not smbclient anyway - it uses 139 by default
2007-05-01T11:41:00.000Z	pipegeek	soundray	not on my machine it doesn't.  When I run it from the command line, it times out twice trying to connect to 128.148.254.10:445 before it finally successfully connects to port 139
2007-05-01T11:41:00.000Z	pipegeek	soundray	unless I specify port=139, in which case it works right away
2007-05-01T11:43:00.000Z	soundray	pipegeek	you would think that this kind of thing can be configured in gnome...
2007-05-01T11:43:00.000Z	pipegeek	soundray	Can't seem to find a way
2007-05-01T11:44:00.000Z	pipegeek	soundray	Can't specify the port after the server (ie, smb://foo.bar.com:139/), as gnome doesn't understand it
2007-05-01T11:46:00.000Z	soundray	pipegeek	can't find anything either, sorry
2007-05-01T11:46:00.000Z	pipegeek	soundray	thanks anyhow
2007-05-01T11:46:00.000Z	soundray	pipegeek	you'll have to re-ask
2007-05-01T11:47:00.000Z	pipegeek	soundray	okie dokie.  Thanks
