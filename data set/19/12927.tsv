2005-06-14T10:54:00.000Z	ubuntu_n00b	FR500	wellll...  the amd 64 is a difference ....
2005-06-14T10:55:00.000Z	ubuntu_n00b	FR500	.... the drivers are on my WinXP HD (ntfs) (and I haven't figured out how to mount it yet through Ubuntu live.)
2005-06-14T10:56:00.000Z	FR500	ubuntu_n00b	the chances on getting wifi to work on livecd are slimer than an installed one
2005-06-14T10:56:00.000Z	FR500	ubuntu_n00b	probably just installing it will work
