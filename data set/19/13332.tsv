2008-12-12T08:54:00.000Z	\slash		is there a java creator for ubuntu ?
2008-12-12T08:55:00.000Z	Wyzard	\slash	If you're looking for an IDE for writing code, Eclipse and NetBeans both run in Linux
2008-12-12T08:57:00.000Z	Wyzard	\slash	of course it does -- it'll recognize any classes in the standard library (e.g. java.util.*) as well as any library jars you've added to your project
2008-12-12T08:57:00.000Z	Wyzard	\slash	What's the error?
2008-12-12T08:59:00.000Z	Wyzard	\slash	Looks like Scanner was added in Java 5...  you might be running Eclipse using something like GIJ that doesn't provide all the Java 5 stuff
2008-12-12T09:00:00.000Z	Wyzard	\slash	Open Window->Preferences, and under Java, Installed JREs, see what's listed there
2008-12-12T09:00:00.000Z	Wyzard	\slash	What do you see in the Name and Location columns there?
2008-12-12T09:01:00.000Z	Wyzard	\slash	Open the Preferences window (Window->Preferences on the menu bar)
2008-12-12T09:02:00.000Z	Wyzard	\slash	You get a window with a list of items on the left side...  click the arrow next to "Java", then click on "Installed JREs"
2008-12-12T09:02:00.000Z	Wyzard	\slash	I mean the Eclipse menu, not the GNOME Applications menu
2008-12-12T09:03:00.000Z	Wyzard	\slash	What's the location?
2008-12-12T09:05:00.000Z	Wyzard	\slash	Did you install any packages with "sun-java" in their name?
2008-12-12T09:06:00.000Z	Wyzard	\slash	and how did you install that?
2008-12-12T09:07:00.000Z	Wyzard	\slash	Was it sun-java6-jdk?
2008-12-12T09:08:00.000Z	Wyzard	\slash	Installing Java 6 would not give you a /usr/lib/jre/java-1.5.0 -- that'd give you /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun-1.6.0.10 (assuming 8.10)
2008-12-12T09:09:00.000Z	Wyzard	\slash	so that /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.5.0 that Eclipse is running under must've come from something else
2008-12-12T09:09:00.000Z	Wyzard	\slash	What's in your /usr/lib/jvm directory?
2008-12-12T09:12:00.000Z	Wyzard	\slash	You have Sun Java 6 *and* GCJ's clone of Java 1.5
2008-12-12T09:12:00.000Z	Wyzard	\slash	and the 1.5 one seems to be what Eclipse was running under
