2010-03-09T08:10:00.000Z	Desciero		Can anyone tell me how to get sound back? I tried installing Open Sound System (OSS) which deletes ALSA and pulseaudio. Didn't help so I deleted OSS and reinstalled ALSA, but now I cannot see my volume bar. Not sure what to do from here.
2010-03-09T08:12:00.000Z	Curly_Q	Desciero	do you have any external devices plugged into your sounc card?
2010-03-09T08:12:00.000Z	Desciero	Curly_Q	Nope.
2010-03-09T08:13:00.000Z	Curly_Q	Desciero	have you checked the cables in the first place and see if the audio adapter jacks were mono or stereo?
2010-03-09T08:14:00.000Z	Desciero	Curly_Q	Fairly certain this is not a hardware-related problem. The drivers are screwy or something because I'm able to have perfect sound in Windows.
2010-03-09T08:14:00.000Z	Curly_Q		OK. I am a Master Technician. I was just asking the usual questions.
2010-03-09T08:14:00.000Z	Desciero		No problem.
2010-03-09T08:15:00.000Z	Curly_Q		What version are you using Desciero?
2010-03-09T08:15:00.000Z	Desciero		Karmic
2010-03-09T08:15:00.000Z	Curly_Q		It sounds like the drivers are an issue or just plain a misconfiguration.
2010-03-09T08:16:00.000Z	Desciero	Curly_Q	So what do I do?
2010-03-09T08:16:00.000Z	Curly_Q		Have you tried seeing if your sound card or board is supported. In most respects, it is a generic board configuration that is what works.
2010-03-09T08:17:00.000Z	Curly_Q		Most exotic boards are proprietary.
2010-03-09T08:17:00.000Z	Desciero		I have an Intel A97. I believe it's supported.
2010-03-09T08:19:00.000Z	Curly_Q	Desciero	do you get any noise or anything from the speakers?
2010-03-09T08:21:00.000Z	Desciero	Curly_Q	Just ran this test and got sound: aplay /usr/share/sounds/alsa/Front_Center.wav
2010-03-09T08:21:00.000Z	Desciero	Curly_Q	But my volume bar is nowhere to be found.
2010-03-09T08:24:00.000Z	Curly_Q	Desciero	when you open up a .wav file try right clicking it to see if there is a properties adjustment.
2010-03-09T08:24:00.000Z	Desciero	Curly_Q	Just checked and my card is supported. IT's the ICH5: http://www.alsa-project.org/main/index.php/Matrix:Vendor-Intel
