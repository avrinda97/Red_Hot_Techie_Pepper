2007-10-19T02:35:00.000Z	Blama		Can someone help me with this problem? New Link http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=3562587
2007-10-19T02:37:00.000Z	Blama		I boot into the Ubuntu Install CD and choose the first install and the screen flashes and the monitor looses signal. It sits there forever, the computer doesn't turn off and the drive doesn't stop spinning. I tried it in safe graphics mode and it does the same thing. Version 7.04 normal does the same thing.
