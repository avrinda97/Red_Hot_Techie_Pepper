2004-12-31T15:07:00.000Z	neighborlee	Riddell	hmmm now I forget what my question was ?LOL..was this about jahshaka ?
2004-12-31T15:07:00.000Z	neighborlee	Riddell	if so I did get it working afterall
2004-12-31T15:08:00.000Z	Riddell	neighborlee	your question was about mplayer licensing problems
2004-12-31T15:09:00.000Z	neighborlee	Riddell	no surprise though i'm sure they dont want us using it till they fix licensing issues <G>
2004-12-31T15:09:00.000Z	neighborlee	Riddell	unless of course we compile it which I have zero intentin of doing <G>
2004-12-31T15:18:00.000Z	Riddell	neighborlee	I think the problems with mplayer licencing are not infringement but technicalities (not including GPL licence text, not adding GPL notices to some files, not saying that some files are modified) but you can get it from marillat
2004-12-31T15:19:00.000Z	neighborlee	Riddell	well..yeah I can understand the gpl stuff..although I do have marillat in my repository yet I got several dependency problems when trying to get it..would you try and see if you also have trouble...???
2004-12-31T15:21:00.000Z	Riddell	neighborlee	I'm using "deb ftp://ftp.nerim.net/debian-marillat/ unstable main" and hoary and havn't had any dependency problems
2004-12-31T15:21:00.000Z	neighborlee	Riddell	lemme check
2004-12-31T15:22:00.000Z	neighborlee	Riddell	ftp://ftp.nerim.net/debian-marillat/ : unstable: main < is what I have too and I'm unable to install : mplayer-586 without getting many dependency conflicts....
2004-12-31T15:23:00.000Z	Riddell	neighborlee	are you using hoary?
2004-12-31T15:27:00.000Z	Riddell	neighborlee	warty is several months old
2004-12-31T15:37:00.000Z	neighborlee	Riddell	several months old meaning I need to dist-upgrade to get things working ?
2005-01-18T17:48:00.000Z	Riddell	neighborlee	qt is 100% Free Software
2005-01-18T17:48:00.000Z	Riddell	neighborlee	infact it's under the GPL so unlike Gnome it guarantees your freedom
