2008-05-07T03:35:00.000Z	leveeathan	doug_	at least 4,5 things, like the NVIDIA onboard chip, the lan, the sound, ... only the wlan was working almost
2008-05-07T03:36:00.000Z	doug_	leveeathan	 when you went to the hp site did you chat to a live tech person?
2008-05-07T03:36:00.000Z	doug_	leveeathan	 i had a real hard time finding xp drivers for my machine that is built for vista. but they helped me get the drivers.
2008-05-07T03:37:00.000Z	leveeathan	doug_	no I didn't. My cousin had to do it for a deffective dvd drive. His painful experience doesn't attract me one bit. Ubuntu it is :)
2008-05-07T03:39:00.000Z	leveeathan	doug_	wow. good to know, thanks
2008-05-07T03:39:00.000Z	doug_	leveeathan	yw lol when i got the comp home 2 min after i had it i wiped vista put xp on it then ubuntu.
2008-05-07T03:40:00.000Z	leveeathan	doug_	I have to wonder if it's possible for one to love both ubuntu and vista as well, it's like being a gay muslim, not that I would have anything against it!
2008-05-07T03:41:00.000Z	doug_	leveeathan	 im running xp for games only since i got a big prob with wine.
