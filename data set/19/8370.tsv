2007-08-05T08:11:00.000Z	Jaikkanen	hmmmsomething	careful accusing ubuntu of it, when your in a room of ubuntu enthusiasts.. plus we mostly gather it was a user, not the OS that screwed it up :D
2007-08-05T08:13:00.000Z	Jaikkanen	hmmmsomething	vista and ubuntu must have fought a fierce battle.. i guess ubuntu came up on top! muwahaa
2007-08-05T08:13:00.000Z	Jaikkanen	hmmmsomething	no but seriously, err, does the dos OS selection come up?
2007-08-05T08:14:00.000Z	Jaikkanen	hmmmsomething	suicide bomber
2007-08-05T08:14:00.000Z	Jaikkanen	hmmmsomething	you dont even get that far? wow.. ok.. but you can run the ubuntu live disc right?
2007-08-05T08:15:00.000Z	Jaikkanen	hmmmsomething	well i dont know why it froze half way, ive never heard of such a problem
2007-08-05T08:16:00.000Z	Jaikkanen	hmmmsomething	i dual boot, only got windows for gaming, i doubt you would though, if your using vista.. ick
2007-08-05T08:16:00.000Z	Jaikkanen	hmmmsomething	you should beable to retrieve your data right? while running the live cd?
2007-08-05T08:16:00.000Z	Jaikkanen	hmmmsomething	well you had personal data on your HDDs right?
2007-08-05T08:17:00.000Z	Jaikkanen	hmmmsomething	well you might beable to mount your vista partition from live cd.. and access them
2007-08-05T08:18:00.000Z	Jaikkanen	hmmmsomething	i see, so you dont know what mounting is? well.. ether way.. you should able to look into your windows harddrive... and copy the data out.. maybe
2007-08-05T08:19:00.000Z	Jaikkanen	hmmmsomething	mm, thats true.. dunno why i didnt think of that
2007-08-05T08:21:00.000Z	Jaikkanen	hmmmsomething	did you get that?
2007-08-05T08:22:00.000Z	Jaikkanen	hmmmsomething	you could even try installing ubuntu once more.. if it is successful this time.. it will also fix the problem
2007-08-05T08:22:00.000Z	Jaikkanen	hmmmsomething	oh damn
2007-08-05T08:22:00.000Z	Jaikkanen	hmmmsomething	doesnt connect? LAN?
2007-08-05T08:24:00.000Z	Jaikkanen	hmmmsomething	ah ok cool, well ether way, i dunno if that link is decent.. but he is right, if you install supergrub, should be fine
2007-08-05T08:25:00.000Z	Jaikkanen	hmmmsomething	yes, it would very likely work
2007-08-05T08:26:00.000Z	Jaikkanen	hmmmsomething	your welcome
