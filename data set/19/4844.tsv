2008-10-26T19:21:00.000Z	jjdiamond	LjL	ok.
2008-10-26T19:21:00.000Z	LjL	jjdiamond	no
2008-10-26T19:21:00.000Z	LjL	jjdiamond	no reason why you should
2008-10-26T19:20:00.000Z	LjL	jjdiamond	files that have lost their inode or something, recovered by fsck
2008-10-26T19:21:00.000Z	jjdiamond	LjL	can i delete it?
2008-10-26T19:39:00.000Z	LjL	jjdiamond	same thing
2008-10-26T19:37:00.000Z	LjL	jjdiamond	probably because it's mounted with root permissions only
2008-10-26T19:37:00.000Z	LjL	jjdiamond	what filesystem does it have?
2008-10-26T19:38:00.000Z	jjdiamond	LjL	ek3 or whatever it's called
2008-10-26T19:38:00.000Z	LjL	jjdiamond	ext3. type "ls -l /media/whereveritsmounted", see what the owner and permissions are
2008-10-26T19:39:00.000Z	jjdiamond	LjL	it's under /mnt not /media
2008-10-26T19:41:00.000Z	jjdiamond	LjL	don't understand
2008-10-26T19:42:00.000Z	LjL	jjdiamond	type "ls -l /mnt/whatever" and paste the output
2008-10-26T19:42:00.000Z	jjdiamond	LjL	total 16
2008-10-26T19:43:00.000Z	LjL	jjdiamond	do also "ls -l -d /mnt/whatever"
2008-10-26T19:43:00.000Z	jjdiamond	LjL	drwxr-xr-x 4 root root 4096 2008-10-26 10:45 /mnt/seagate500
2008-10-26T19:44:00.000Z	LjL	jjdiamond	ok that is the problem, you don't have permissions to write to it. try, for a start, "sudo chown yourusername:yourusername /mnt/seagate500"
2008-10-26T19:49:00.000Z	jjdiamond	LjL	thanks.
2008-10-27T18:33:00.000Z	LjL	jjdiamond	more or less
