2008-04-30T16:48:00.000Z	ohyouknow1987		hi, im new to ubuntu, i am having a problem getting youtube videos to play, can someone help me out?
2008-04-30T16:49:00.000Z	jrib	ohyouknow1987	visit http://www.macromedia.com/software/flash/about/ and click on the yellow bar that shows up
2008-04-30T16:50:00.000Z	jrib	ohyouknow1987	did what exactly?  You were given two suggestions
2008-04-30T16:51:00.000Z	jrib	ohyouknow1987	pastebin the output of 'apt-cache policy flashplugin-nonfree
2008-04-30T16:55:00.000Z	ohyouknow1987	jrib	yes
2008-04-30T16:55:00.000Z	jrib	ohyouknow1987	no, you need to open a terminal, run the command 'apt-cache policy flashplugin-nonfree' and pastebin *that*.  Remember to prefix what you say with the nick of who you are addressing
2008-04-30T16:56:00.000Z	ohyouknow1987	jrib	oo ok thanks i'll try that
2008-04-30T16:58:00.000Z	ohyouknow1987	jrib	http://paste.ubuntu.com/8910/
2008-04-30T16:58:00.000Z	jrib	ohyouknow1987	k, now close all instances of firefox, and visit http://www.macromedia.com/software/flash/about/ .  What does it say about your version of flash?
2008-04-30T17:00:00.000Z	ohyouknow1987	jrib	8,0,99,0 is my version
2008-04-30T17:00:00.000Z	jrib	ohyouknow1987	then flash is installed
2008-04-30T17:01:00.000Z	ohyouknow1987	jrib	ok then why when i hit play on youtube it just skips over the video and says share/ watch again?
2008-04-30T17:02:00.000Z	jrib	ohyouknow1987	well you do have an old version for some reason.  Have you installed some other flash as well?  Maybe gnash or a version you installed manually before?
2008-04-30T17:02:00.000Z	ohyouknow1987	jrib	i may have installed gnash
2008-04-30T17:02:00.000Z	jrib	ohyouknow1987	remove it, restart firefox
2008-04-30T17:04:00.000Z	ohyouknow1987	jrib	thanks so much it works!!!
