2010-02-21T20:37:00.000Z	antoni		hi, i got the upgrade to (ubunstustudio) 9.10 is stuck on "preparing openoffice.org-writer2latex". most likely this is because of this bug: https://bugs.launchpad.net/openoffice/+bug/368570. there are instructions there, but i've got no idea what to do since this is an ongoing upgrade
2010-02-21T20:38:00.000Z	abhi_nav	antoni	leave i searched for the solution for the SAME prob, but no success
2010-02-21T20:39:00.000Z	abhi_nav	antoni	there is something mesesd with oo writer
2010-02-21T20:40:00.000Z	abhi_nav	antoni	if in future you succed to solve the prbome then please let me know.
2010-02-21T20:56:00.000Z	antoni	abhi_nav	the problem is with a certain rt kernel. if you manage to install a generic kernel and do the maintenance on it (including upgrade), the problem should be gone, especially with the new version of the -rt kernel
2010-02-21T20:59:00.000Z	abhi_nav	antoni	but dont you thing its is VERY MUCH EASY to just use ubuntu and install necessary multimedia softwares? Can anyone tell me whats the ACTUAL diffrenc between ubuntu and ubuntustudio? other than it has already installed multimedia softwares??????????
2010-02-21T21:00:00.000Z	antoni	abhi_nav	as far as i know, there's none. ubuntustudio is a tailored choice of elements, but you can reach exactly the same config by hand-installing (although it's not only about multimedia packages, also about the kernel and layout)
2010-02-21T21:01:00.000Z	abhi_nav	antoni	but what EXACTLY that kernal diffrence is? I can do all the multimedia work here in ubuntu also naa?
2010-02-21T21:01:00.000Z	antoni	abhi_nav	still, they messed up with that kernel and there is no patch
2010-02-21T21:01:00.000Z	abhi_nav	antoni	yah
2010-02-21T21:02:00.000Z	antoni	abhi_nav	afaik rt means less quality, more realtime
2010-02-21T21:02:00.000Z	abhi_nav	antoni	yah i know
2010-02-21T21:04:00.000Z	antoni	abhi_nav	actually for a long time i never used rt (mode, not kernel)  - jack doesn't work with it
2010-02-21T21:05:00.000Z	abhi_nav	antoni	yah so now you are using ubuntu or studio?
2010-02-21T21:05:00.000Z	antoni	abhi_nav	studio, but struggling with abovementioned problems :D
2010-02-21T21:06:00.000Z	abhi_nav	antoni	Best of LucK!!!
