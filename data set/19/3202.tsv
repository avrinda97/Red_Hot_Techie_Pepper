2009-12-13T07:34:00.000Z	eclipse_		I have a SATA dvd drive that I'm trying to mount in ubuntu, but I cant find the device. Are there any tricks to getting it to show up
2009-12-13T07:36:00.000Z	losha	eclipse_	they are usually named /dev/sr0, /dev/sr1 etc. Try running eject /dev/sr0 etc. and see if the tray opens
2009-12-13T07:41:00.000Z	eclipse_	losha	there sg0
2009-12-13T07:42:00.000Z	losha	eclipse_	/dev/sg0 ?
2009-12-13T07:42:00.000Z	eclipse_	losha	yes
2009-12-13T07:42:00.000Z	eclipse_	losha	that does not eject the drive, I think it may be a different device
2009-12-13T07:43:00.000Z	losha	eclipse_	Not what I expected. Which os version is this?
2009-12-13T07:44:00.000Z	losha	eclipse_	what does 'dmesg | egrep -i dvd' say?
2009-12-13T07:46:00.000Z	eclipse_	losha	no return
2009-12-13T07:47:00.000Z	losha	eclipse_	that's bad, that suggests it isn't even seeing the dvd drive. Do you have 'Disk Utility' somewhere under the system menu?
2009-12-13T07:53:00.000Z	eclipse_	losha	disk manager
2009-12-13T07:54:00.000Z	losha	eclipse_	close enough, Run it and see if it lists the disks and dvd drive...
2009-12-13T07:56:00.000Z	losha	eclipse_	I don't think the dvd drive has been recognised by the kernel. This usually means a hardware problem. Is it a known working device? Are all the connections good etc....
2009-12-13T07:57:00.000Z	losha	eclipse_	'device works' -- you mean it has power and the blinky light comes on?
2009-12-13T07:58:00.000Z	eclipse_	losha	yes, it works in a different machine. I'm going to try a live cd in another cd drive
2009-12-13T07:59:00.000Z	losha	eclipse_	before you do that, I would try the drive in a different sata port (you will need to reboot). Just a hunch....
2009-12-13T08:00:00.000Z	eclipse_	losha	 the drive shows up in bios.
2009-12-13T08:01:00.000Z	losha	eclipse_	weird. Sorry, I'm out of ideas then....
2009-12-13T08:01:00.000Z	eclipse_	losha	no problem, thanks for the help
