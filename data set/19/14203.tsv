2006-09-27T12:35:00.000Z	andred		How can I enable a non-UTF-8 locale in Ubuntu, such as ISO-8859-1?
2006-09-27T12:35:00.000Z	Blissex	andred	very carefully! :-)
2006-09-27T12:36:00.000Z	Blissex	andred	and depends what you mean by enabling and in which context.
2006-09-27T12:36:00.000Z	andred	Blissex	Yeah, I don't want to use it generally, just for a specific application by passing LANG=sv_SE.ISO-8859-1
2006-09-27T12:36:00.000Z	Blissex	andred	ahhhh that's easy. Just make sure you got the relevant locale files.
2006-09-27T12:37:00.000Z	Blissex	andred	'locale -a' and 'dpkg-reconfigure locale' or something similar.
2006-09-27T12:38:00.000Z	andred	Blissex	Yeah, that's how I've done it before in Debian, but running dpkg-reconfigure locales doesn't bring up the config program where you can select the locales, it just generates locales that are chosen from somewhere.
2006-09-27T12:39:00.000Z	Blissex	andred	there is a difference between choosing which locales are available (as listed by 'locale -a') and which one is active. What's the problem?
2006-09-27T12:40:00.000Z	andred	Blissex	Like I said when I run "dpkg-reconfigure locales" it just starts generating the locales, but I want to select a new locale to generate.
2006-09-27T12:40:00.000Z	Blissex	andred	but that also allows you to select which locales it generates.
2006-09-27T12:41:00.000Z	andred	Blissex	Aha, but how? It just starts generating right away without showing that dialog window I always used to get in Debian.
2006-09-27T12:41:00.000Z	andred	Blissex	Try it yourself and you'll see
2006-09-27T12:41:00.000Z	Blissex	andred	ahhhhhhhhh. I can't remember.
2006-09-27T12:42:00.000Z	andred	Blissex	Aha. Any idea who I should ask about it?
2006-09-27T12:43:00.000Z	Blissex	andred	this channel of course :-) Or Google or the Wiki :-).
2006-09-27T12:45:00.000Z	Blissex	andred	anyhow have a look at '/etc/locale-gen' and the 'locale-gen' command.
2006-09-27T12:46:00.000Z	andred	Blissex	All right, thanks
2006-09-27T12:51:00.000Z	andred	Blissex	Adding "sv_SE.ISO-8859-1 ISO-8859-1 in the file "/var/lib/locales/supported.d/sv" worked, just for your information.
2006-09-27T12:53:00.000Z	Blissex	andred	that is a very odd location.
