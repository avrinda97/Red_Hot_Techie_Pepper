2005-11-18T17:08:00.000Z	CosmoDad	stratovarius	I'd try figuring out if the slowness can be observed with a different OS as well..
2005-11-18T17:09:00.000Z	CosmoDad	stratovarius	and for a quick shot: did some network configurations change, like DNS server?
2005-11-18T17:09:00.000Z	CosmoDad	stratovarius	if you suspect Firefox to be responsible, try Nautilus or Konqueror
2005-11-18T17:10:00.000Z	stratovarius	CosmoDad	i dont tink its a dns problem
2005-11-18T17:10:00.000Z	stratovarius		i changed nothing
2005-11-18T17:10:00.000Z	CosmoDad	stratovarius	Firefox allows you to see which part of page loading is currently active through the status bar... does the DNS resolution come up quickly but the data transfers lags?
2005-11-18T17:11:00.000Z	stratovarius	CosmoDad	I dont kow what u want to know cuz my problem is a temporary problem which solved by itself
2005-11-18T17:12:00.000Z	stratovarius	CosmoDad	to solve the problem I ususally restart X and it works good =|
2005-11-18T17:12:00.000Z	CosmoDad	stratovarius	I didn't read that
2005-11-18T17:14:00.000Z	CosmoDad	stratovarius	strange problem.. maybe you wann check all active network programs, using netstat fr instance, and some network traffic monitor
2005-11-18T17:14:00.000Z	CosmoDad	stratovarius	and compare CPU usage between laggy and non-laggy scenarios
2005-11-18T17:15:00.000Z	stratovarius	CosmoDad	i think I'm not able to do what u said :D
2005-11-18T17:16:00.000Z	CosmoDad	stratovarius	the tools you want are netstat, ps, and top, for the network monitor I'd look for something GUI-like
2005-11-18T17:16:00.000Z	CosmoDad	stratovarius	if I had time I might guide you but I need to be off in some minutes and can only recommend the man-pages to you
2005-11-18T17:16:00.000Z	stratovarius	CosmoDad	dont worry tnx a lot
