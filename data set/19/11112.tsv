2008-08-03T23:06:00.000Z	marie		how do I stop example.org from appearing in /etc/resolv.conf
2008-08-03T23:06:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	marie	this is something you would edit in the network manager.
2008-08-03T23:12:00.000Z	marie	fyrestrtr	it doesn't matter where I edit it, my changes only stay for a short time, a few minutes maybe
2008-08-03T23:12:00.000Z	marie	fyrestrtr	I have chmod 444 /etc/resolv.conf, I have killed knetworkmanager, I have edited in GUI, I have edited in vim, does not matter
2008-08-03T23:13:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	marie	how is your network setup? Do you have a DHCP server?
2008-08-03T23:15:00.000Z	marie	fyrestrtr	I do have DHCP server, but while having this issue I have put all IP settings static, still did not work
2008-08-03T23:16:00.000Z	marie	fyrestrtr	currently the only solution I can think of is to setup a cron for every minute "I do have DHCP server, but while having this issue I have put all IP settings static, still did not work"
2008-08-03T23:16:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	marie	it comes from the 'default search domain' which is setup somewhere in your networking. Either your DHCP server is pushing this to you, or you have it setup in one of your profiles. I have not used KDE so I cannot help you with specifics, but that's the problem you have.
2008-08-03T23:16:00.000Z	marie	fyrestrtr	I do "sudo grep -r example.org /etc/* " and only find the resolv.conf file
2008-08-03T23:17:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	marie	you are looking in the wrong place. Its part of your network profiles.
2008-08-03T23:18:00.000Z	marie	fyrestrtr	network profiles are in /etc/ tree correct?
2008-08-03T23:19:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	marie	nope :)
2008-08-03T23:19:00.000Z	marie	fyrestrtr	my dhcp server is currently off
2008-08-03T23:21:00.000Z	marie	fyrestrtr	ifconfig shows only eth0 and lo0, and they are set correct
2008-08-03T23:22:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	marie	you are barking up the wrong tree.
2008-08-03T23:22:00.000Z	marie	fyrestrtr	I've barked the whole kubuntu forest,, no joy
2008-08-03T23:22:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	marie	come on over to the lovely green hills of gnome and I'll help you out, I don't venture into the kubuntu forest.
2008-08-04T00:10:00.000Z	marie	fyrestrtr	hwilde KlrSp1 .. thank you all for the help.. .. restarting network did not fix
2008-08-04T00:30:00.000Z	marie	fyrestrtr	hwilde KlrSp1 ... I don't mind if a proc updates the resolv.conf, the problem is that resolv.conf is getting polluted with bogus info
