2008-04-28T01:17:00.000Z	ihearthardy	dubby	do you think it is possible to upgrade from live cd? like tell it to sudo apt-get dist-upgrade to /dev/sda1?
2008-04-28T01:18:00.000Z	dubby	ihearthardy	yeah im certain there is a way to do exactly like you said, that and just install libc off the livecd
2008-04-28T01:18:00.000Z	ihearthardy	dubby	the real question is how? i think it is possible :)
2008-04-28T01:23:00.000Z	ihearthardy	dubby	definitely
2008-04-28T01:24:00.000Z	ihearthardy	dubby	i've worked really hard on tweaking everything..
2008-04-28T01:27:00.000Z	dubby	ihearthardy	have you tried chroot ?
2008-04-28T01:27:00.000Z	ihearthardy	dubby	no idea what that means
2008-04-28T01:27:00.000Z	ihearthardy	dubby	never usd it
2008-04-28T01:27:00.000Z	dubby	ihearthardy	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroot
2008-04-28T01:28:00.000Z	ihearthardy	dubby	how would chroot help?
2008-04-28T01:29:00.000Z	dubby	ihearthardy	you boot from live cd then you chroot apt-get to use the other device but with the cd's librarys
2008-04-28T01:29:00.000Z	ihearthardy	dubby	that might save it?
2008-04-28T01:29:00.000Z	ihearthardy	dubby	the command would be what then?
2008-04-28T01:30:00.000Z	dubby	ihearthardy	read up on how to use chroot, its more in depth then what i can say in 3 minutes
2008-04-28T01:31:00.000Z	ihearthardy	dubby	is there a special command though?
