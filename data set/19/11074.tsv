2011-05-06T02:37:00.000Z	Trel		I installed Ubuntu server, and I just edited /etc/ssh/ssh_config to change the port, however I can't figure out how to restart ssh, the command on the website, plus the command THAT told me to use didn't do it.
2011-05-06T02:37:00.000Z	Trel		(website was initi.d, and it told me to use service)
2011-05-06T02:38:00.000Z	Dulak	Trel	sudo service ssh restart
2011-05-06T02:47:00.000Z	Trel	Dulak	is it definitely using /etc/ssh/ssh_config ?
2011-05-06T02:38:00.000Z	Trel	Dulak	that's what it told me to do when I did the init.d command. That apparantly didn't work, as it's still listening on port 22 and not what I changed it to.
2011-05-06T02:39:00.000Z	Dulak	Trel	then do 'sudo service ssh stop' followed by 'sudo service ssh start'
2011-05-06T02:40:00.000Z	Dulak	Trel	restart should do that, so that's weird
2011-05-06T02:40:00.000Z	Trel	Dulak	that could be interesting since I won't be able to run the second command ><
2011-05-06T02:41:00.000Z	Trel	Dulak	that didn't work either
2011-05-06T02:42:00.000Z	Dulak	Trel	an existing connection is unaffected by a restart, or a stop, just fyi
2011-05-06T02:42:00.000Z	Dulak	Trel	double check sshd_config
2011-05-06T02:43:00.000Z	Trel	Dulak	only thing I changed was to uncommend the port line and changed the number
2011-05-06T02:44:00.000Z	Dulak	Trel	try this: 'sudo invoke-rc.d ssh restart'
2011-05-06T02:45:00.000Z	Trel	Dulak	I sent in a message as not to flood the channel
2011-05-06T02:46:00.000Z	Dulak	Trel	then use 'sudo stop ssh' and 'sudo start ssh'
2011-05-06T02:46:00.000Z	Trel	Dulak	same result as via service
2011-05-06T02:47:00.000Z	Dulak	Trel	weird, I just did it and it all worked.  changed the port, restarted with service, confirmed the port, switched it all back again
2011-05-06T02:48:00.000Z	Dulak	Trel	yeah the sshd from the repos definitely uses that file, I just did everything you are doing and it worked fine
2011-05-06T02:51:00.000Z	Trel	Dulak	my bad, not ssh_config, I should have been editing sshd_config
