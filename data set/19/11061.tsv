2006-11-09T07:18:00.000Z	Khamael		no one answered in ubuntu-xgl. shouldn`t it be safe to run the official nvidia drivers with beryl on edgy now? my beryl-manager freezes xorg
2006-11-09T07:19:00.000Z	chuckyp	Khamael	well beryl is still not stable.
2006-11-09T07:19:00.000Z	Khamael	chuckyp	i see. the thing is, it worked perfectly with the nvidia beta drivers
2006-11-09T07:20:00.000Z	chuckyp	Khamael	I know there are issues with beryl and the latest release of the envy drivers.
2006-11-09T07:21:00.000Z	Khamael	chuckyp	how do I check what release I have? it just removed nvidia-glx with dist-upgrade, and installed a new nvidia driver after a "apt-get install nividia-glx"
2006-11-09T07:22:00.000Z	Khamael	chuckyp	and everything seems to work, apart from beryl-manager
2006-11-09T07:22:00.000Z	chuckyp	Khamael	cat /etc/issue  i think
2006-11-09T07:23:00.000Z	Khamael	chuckyp	that just says ubuntu 6.10
2006-11-09T07:23:00.000Z	chuckyp	Khamael	you are running edgy
2006-11-09T07:23:00.000Z	chuckyp	Khamael	6.10 is the version of hte distro you are running.
2006-11-09T07:24:00.000Z	Khamael	chuckyp	I meant what nvidia release. I guess envy was a typo?
2006-11-09T07:24:00.000Z	chuckyp	Khamael	oh you mena which version of nvidia
2006-11-09T07:24:00.000Z	chuckyp	Khamael	do you have hte current one from the repos?
2006-11-09T07:24:00.000Z	chuckyp	Khamael	if so you can apt-cache showpkg nvidia-glx
2006-11-09T07:25:00.000Z	chuckyp	Khamael	if not ls /var/cache/apt/archives | grep nvidia
2006-11-09T07:31:00.000Z	Khamael	chuckyp	is there a way to check if my nvidia card works like it should?
2006-11-09T07:32:00.000Z	chuckyp	Khamael	like a 3d test or something?  What sort of issue are you having.
2006-11-09T07:33:00.000Z	Khamael	chuckyp	haven`t tested all that much, but my problem is that beryl-manager freezes my xorg
2006-11-09T07:34:00.000Z	chuckyp	Khamael	hrm.. yeah I would keep checking in #ubuntu-xgl
