2010-03-29T04:21:00.000Z	moosekaka		hello i have a hardware router question: when i reinstalled my winxp (dual boot with hardy) my dlink 615 router suddenly stopped working for wireless (wires is ok)...cannot get an IP in linux...doesnt matter if its NM or WICD
2010-03-29T04:21:00.000Z	moosekaka		however once i reinstalled the router driver in XP it works again in linux
2010-03-29T04:21:00.000Z	moosekaka		broadcom 440 ?intel wireless pro
2010-03-29T04:22:00.000Z	moosekaka		so firmware is stored on the router? confused
2010-03-29T04:24:00.000Z	moosekaka		im just confused why i needed to run the install driver CD for the router in xp before linux could get the router to work...short answer is that firmware wasnt loaded? but how can linux know where the firmware for the driver is since i installed in XP
2010-03-29T04:25:00.000Z	moosekaka		well it works fine now in linux after i reinstalled the drivers in xp
2010-03-29T04:26:00.000Z	moosekaka		thats whats confusing me....everything i did in xp is on a separate partition
2010-03-29T04:26:00.000Z	histo	moosekaka	So the card didn't work in xp untill you isntalled what?
2010-03-29T04:21:00.000Z	histo	moosekaka	what type of wireless card do you have?
2010-03-29T04:21:00.000Z	histo	moosekaka	the firmware is needed for your card.
2010-03-29T04:22:00.000Z	histo	moosekaka	no the firmware for your wireless card is the issue
2010-03-29T04:23:00.000Z	histo	moosekaka	the driver loads the firmware so it doesn't work unless its present
2010-03-29T04:25:00.000Z	histo	moosekaka	the issue is most likely that your card works fine in Xp but doesn't in linux. Has nothign to do with the router
2010-03-29T04:26:00.000Z	histo	moosekaka	thats not a driver cd. Routers don't have drivers
2010-03-29T04:27:00.000Z	histo	moosekaka	its probably a setup disk that you don't really need.
2010-03-29T04:27:00.000Z	histo	moosekaka	your cd ffor the router probably blew out whatever settings where causing the issue with the router
2010-03-29T04:28:00.000Z	histo	moosekaka	but you don't need the cd you can point a browser at the IP of the router to configure it.
2010-03-29T04:28:00.000Z	moosekaka	histo	hmmn interesting but still i did the CD thing on the NTFS partition...if nothing is stored on the router how can it fix the issue for linux?
2010-03-29T04:29:00.000Z	histo	moosekaka	becuase the Router settings got changed when you ran the cd.
