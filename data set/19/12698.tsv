2005-07-21T14:53:00.000Z	ubuntu		I need to install ubuntu over an existing installation, but keep one of the directories completely untouched (/backup)
2005-07-21T14:53:00.000Z	ubuntu		possible?
2005-07-21T14:53:00.000Z	ubuntu		well?
2005-07-21T14:53:00.000Z	ubuntu		IS IT!?
2005-07-21T14:53:00.000Z	ubuntu		sheet
2005-07-21T14:53:00.000Z	ubuntu		I need to install ubuntu over an existing installation, but keep one of the directories completely untouched (/backup)
2005-07-21T14:54:00.000Z	ubuntu		is that possible?!
2005-07-21T14:54:00.000Z	ubuntu		fuck it
2005-07-21T14:54:00.000Z	ubuntu		I guess I'll find out
2005-07-21T14:54:00.000Z	ubuntu		I'll just blame you all if /backups gets deleted
2005-07-21T14:54:00.000Z	highvolt1ge	ubuntu	yes, it is possible.
2005-07-21T14:54:00.000Z	ubuntu	ed1t	the damn cd burner won't work
2005-07-21T14:54:00.000Z	ubuntu		because the current linux installation won't boot
2005-07-21T14:55:00.000Z	highvolt1ge		delete everything except /backups, then choose to keep existing data when you install
2005-07-21T14:55:00.000Z	ubuntu		because I broke slackware trying to get the damn cd burner to work in the first place
2005-07-21T14:55:00.000Z	ubuntu		40 gig
2005-07-21T14:55:00.000Z	highvolt1ge		yes, just remove everything except /backup, or fix the existing system with a live CD
2005-07-21T14:55:00.000Z	ubuntu	ed1t	all VERY important stuff (work related code, documents, etc)
2005-07-21T14:55:00.000Z	highvolt1ge	ubuntu	just don't be impatient. 90%+ of all data is lost because people try quick fixes.
