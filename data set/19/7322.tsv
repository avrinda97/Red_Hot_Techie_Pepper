2009-04-23T13:31:00.000Z	un_dave		it seems the servers are givign 404 errors, how can i update them ?
2009-04-23T13:31:00.000Z	Flannel	un_dave	Which version of Ubuntu are you using?
2009-04-23T13:32:00.000Z	un_dave		the server i'm attempting to update is currently 7.10
2009-04-23T13:32:00.000Z	un_dave	Flannel	^
2009-04-23T13:32:00.000Z	Flannel	un_dave	7.10 reached EOL on april 18th.  As far as I'm aware, the archive.ubuntu.com mirror is still up.  You need to upgrade to 8.04 though, since you're not getting any updates.
2009-04-23T13:33:00.000Z	un_dave	Flannel	i figured i'd apply the 7.10 updates first?
2009-04-23T13:33:00.000Z	un_dave	Flannel	before i updated it to 8.04
2009-04-23T13:33:00.000Z	Flannel	un_dave	Yes, you need to be up to date.  Try switching your mirrors to archive.ubuntu.com
2009-04-23T13:34:00.000Z	un_dave	Flannel	ok, will try that now
2009-04-23T13:34:00.000Z	un_dave		brb
2009-04-23T13:36:00.000Z	un_dave	Flannel	ok, i cant see any options to select the archive sources in the "Software Sources" dialoge
2009-04-23T13:36:00.000Z	Flannel	un_dave	You may have to manually edit your sources.list
2009-04-23T13:37:00.000Z	un_dave	Flannel	ok, i'm fine with that. could you tell me what lines to add?
2009-04-23T13:37:00.000Z	Flannel	un_dave	um, well, pastebin it, and we'll take a look.
