2007-04-24T15:59:00.000Z	velko	taigeR	if you have installed this program with aptitude (instead of apt-get or synaptic) the dependencies will be removed automatically. if you have installed the program with some of these tools you have to remove them by yourself
2007-04-24T16:00:00.000Z	taigeR	velko	what's aptitude?
2007-04-24T16:00:00.000Z	velko	taigeR	if you don't know which packages constitute the dependencies you can look them up with "apt-cache show PKGNAME | grep depends"
2007-04-25T16:01:00.000Z	velko	taigeR	how do you install software?
2007-04-25T16:01:00.000Z	taigeR	velko	but i don't want to remove dependencies that might affect other programs
2007-04-25T16:01:00.000Z	taigeR	velko	i just use synaptic
2007-04-25T16:01:00.000Z	taigeR		i didn't use apt
2007-04-25T16:02:00.000Z	velko	taigeR	synaptic uses apt-get to do it's job. aptitude does the same as apt-get but better
2007-04-25T16:03:00.000Z	taigeR	velko	so how do i remove only the dependencies that were installed?
2007-04-25T16:03:00.000Z	taigeR		how can i view the dependencies that were last installed?
2007-04-25T16:03:00.000Z	velko	taigeR	you tried the command i suggested in order to see the dependencies of a package?
2007-04-25T16:08:00.000Z	taigeR		I cannot use synaptic to remove all the dependencies at once?
2007-04-25T16:09:00.000Z	taigeR	velko	 I cannot use synaptic to remove all the dependencies at once?
2007-04-25T16:09:00.000Z	velko	taigeR	why not?
2007-04-25T16:10:00.000Z	taigeR		well
2007-04-25T16:10:00.000Z	velko	taigeR	just select all of them and remove them at once
2007-04-25T16:10:00.000Z	taigeR	velko	i mean i have to select one by one
2007-04-25T16:11:00.000Z	velko	taigeR	yes. unfortunately
