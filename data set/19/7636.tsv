2007-07-22T16:55:00.000Z	unagi		i dont know how it happened but it happened
2007-07-22T16:55:00.000Z	Davy_Jones	unagi	filesystem check
2007-07-22T16:58:00.000Z	Davy_Jones	unagi	sudo fdisk -l
2007-07-27T09:24:00.000Z	Davy_Jones	unagi	it should work. no, it must work
2007-07-27T09:24:00.000Z	Davy_Jones	unagi	 because you're following what the link say you're configuring grub all over from the start.. so it must work
2007-07-27T09:40:00.000Z	Davy_Jones	unagi	if you want your problem solved, follow the instructions.. it's simple
2007-07-27T09:40:00.000Z	Davy_Jones	unagi	did you do the hd(0,0) thing
2007-07-27T09:41:00.000Z	Davy_Jones	unagi	ohhh, vista.. that's a different issue
2007-07-27T09:41:00.000Z	Davy_Jones	unagi	there is some howto out there to dual boot vista and ubuntu.. google
2007-07-31T08:48:00.000Z	Davy_Jones	unagi	because the internal parts are tested and certified to work with each other
2007-07-31T08:49:00.000Z	Davy_Jones	unagi	i fried my motherboard once because i installed a gfx card that was not compatible
2007-07-31T08:49:00.000Z	Davy_Jones	unagi	no, i'm not that stupid
2007-07-31T08:50:00.000Z	Davy_Jones	unagi	i installed an agp in an agp slot.. the motherboard was a little old, and the card was probably the latest.. i turn the computer on and BAM
