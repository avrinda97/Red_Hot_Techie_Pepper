2011-11-04T15:27:00.000Z	SwashBuckla		they just need to browse the internet
2011-11-04T15:27:00.000Z	SwashBuckla		and open office
2011-11-04T15:27:00.000Z	SwashBuckla		that is all
2011-11-04T15:28:00.000Z	SwashBuckla		no customising the browser
2011-11-04T15:28:00.000Z	SwashBuckla		I may end up using something like Archlinux as it's much easier to customise
2011-11-04T15:30:00.000Z	Gentoo64	SwashBuckla	arch wont prevent anyone doing stuff
2011-11-04T15:25:00.000Z	Gentoo64	SwashBuckla	dont give them sudo rights
2011-11-04T15:27:00.000Z	SwashBuckla	Gentoo64	yeah obviously
2011-11-04T15:27:00.000Z	Gentoo64	SwashBuckla	what do they need to do?
2011-11-04T15:28:00.000Z	Gentoo64	SwashBuckla	not sure if theres an easy way
2011-11-04T15:30:00.000Z	SwashBuckla	Gentoo64	I think it will make it MUCH easier
2011-11-04T15:30:00.000Z	SwashBuckla	Gentoo64	step 1) only install what you need (firefox and libreoffice)
2011-11-04T15:30:00.000Z	Gentoo64	SwashBuckla	but it would probbaly be a better start (more clean)
2011-11-04T15:31:00.000Z	Gentoo64	SwashBuckla	but to prevent them changing things, youd need (afaik) some access cntrol
2011-11-04T15:33:00.000Z	Gentoo64	SwashBuckla	but just because arch would be more minimal, wont stop people using stuff
2011-11-04T15:33:00.000Z	SwashBuckla	Gentoo64	"stuff"?
2011-11-04T15:34:00.000Z	SwashBuckla	Gentoo64	please explain what you mean by "stuff"?
2011-11-04T15:34:00.000Z	Gentoo64	SwashBuckla	you want restriced access right?
2011-11-04T15:35:00.000Z	SwashBuckla	Gentoo64	right
