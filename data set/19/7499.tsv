2009-05-16T17:02:00.000Z	seme		hey guys... i've been working with ubuntu for a little while and I have some suggestions that I'd like to make... is the bug list or ubuntu-devel mailing list the appropriate place
2009-05-16T17:03:00.000Z	seme		hrm....
2009-05-16T17:03:00.000Z	seme		I think that the system isn't functioning as it should but I don't think it was developed to do what I think
2009-05-16T17:04:00.000Z	seme		right now the networks don't register until you log in
2009-05-16T17:04:00.000Z	seme		they also aren't remembering networks you've logged into before
2009-05-16T17:04:00.000Z	seme		sleep settings aren't applied prior to login
2009-05-16T17:05:00.000Z	seme		stuff like that
2009-05-16T17:05:00.000Z	jrib	seme	file bugs
2009-05-16T17:02:00.000Z	jrib	seme	depends.  If it's a bug, file a bug at bugs.ubuntu.com
2009-05-16T17:02:00.000Z	jrib	seme	otherwise there is ubuntu brainstorm
2009-05-16T17:04:00.000Z	jrib	seme	you need to be more specific
2009-05-16T17:05:00.000Z	jrib	seme	you might want to join #ubuntu-bugs and discuss it too
2010-11-27T19:57:00.000Z	jrib	seme	what is "all this"?
2010-11-27T19:59:00.000Z	seme	jrib	it is a poorly worded question ;)... I meant that I would like to pick a location, say $HOME/src/ubuntu, and when I execute apt-get -b source somepackage it puts all the artifacts there such as the downloaded source, resulting debs, etc
2010-11-27T20:00:00.000Z	jrib	seme	just run the command from that directory (cd there first), it extracts things to the current working directory.
2010-11-27T20:03:00.000Z	seme	jrib	thanks :)
2011-02-13T03:34:00.000Z	jrib	seme	no, that recommendation is stupid
2011-02-13T03:36:00.000Z	seme	jrib	thats what I always thought... well at least since flash worked properly on it ;)
2011-02-13T03:47:00.000Z	jrib	seme	yeah, ubuntu will setup flash with nspluginwrapper (has for a while).  I prefer to use the 64bit version adobe put out there though
