2008-03-26T00:00:00.000Z	qense	needhelp	from where does your firestarter icon vanish?
2008-03-26T00:03:00.000Z	qense	needhelp	that's because it's not autostarted by default and very easily closed
2008-03-26T00:04:00.000Z	qense	needhelp	you can solve it by editing the sessions in System-Preferences and add there the command firestarter to start at login
2008-03-26T00:05:00.000Z	qense	needhelp	go to System->Preferences->Sessions
2008-03-26T00:06:00.000Z	qense	needhelp	now press add and insert firestarter as command and think of a name you fancy
2008-03-26T00:06:00.000Z	qense	needhelp	make sure you don't close the program bya ccident
2008-03-26T00:07:00.000Z	qense	needhelp	do you use GNOME?
2008-03-26T00:07:00.000Z	qense	needhelp	btw, this channel is actually for ubuntu support, and mint is another distribution
2008-03-26T00:08:00.000Z	qense	needhelp	it should be the same since it's both gnome
2008-03-26T00:09:00.000Z	qense	needhelp	does mint has a control panel?
