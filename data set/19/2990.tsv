2009-11-12T06:51:00.000Z	Jordan_U	YackityYak	No
2009-11-12T06:51:00.000Z	Jordan_U	YackityYak	Palimpsest uses SMART information from your hard drive
2009-11-12T06:51:00.000Z	YackityYak	Jordan_U	does it mean I have a serious problem?
2009-11-12T06:52:00.000Z	Jordan_U	YackityYak	Yes
2009-11-12T06:52:00.000Z	YackityYak	Jordan_U	what would be best to do next?
2009-11-12T06:52:00.000Z	Jordan_U	YackityYak	Back up any important data to another disk
2009-11-12T06:54:00.000Z	Jordan_U	YackityYak	Self-Monitoring Analysis and Reporting Technology, it's a feature of hard drive hardware that records things like how many read error there are and other warning signs of disk failure
2009-11-12T06:55:00.000Z	YackityYak	Jordan_U	how can things get worse?
2009-11-12T06:55:00.000Z	Jordan_U	YackityYak	Your hard drive could actually fail and lose all your data
2009-11-12T06:56:00.000Z	Jordan_U	YackityYak	You can see why smart is reporting that failure is likely by clicking "More information" in palimpsest
2009-11-12T06:56:00.000Z	YackityYak	Jordan_U	 should I turn it off until I get another hdd?
2009-11-12T06:57:00.000Z	YackityYak	Jordan_U	it says "Read Error Rate"
2009-11-12T06:57:00.000Z	Jordan_U	YackityYak	Depends on how important the data on it is
2009-11-12T06:59:00.000Z	Jordan_U	YackityYak	With an encrypted drive recovering files after parts of the drive are unreadable is much harder
2009-11-12T06:59:00.000Z	YackityYak	Jordan_U	it says "Read Error Rate", what does that mean?
2009-11-12T07:01:00.000Z	YackityYak	Jordan_U	it says "Read Error Rate", what does that mean?
2009-11-12T07:04:00.000Z	YackityYak	Jordan_U	it says "Read Error Rate", what does that mean?
