2011-01-12T00:15:00.000Z	cognitiaclaeves		Wireless for Intel 3945 ABG on a Latitude D830 just stopped working.  Network manager shows it as "not ready" on LTS.  It worked fine before.  Is this a known issue?
2011-01-12T00:15:00.000Z	acicula_	cognitiaclaeves	what does rfkill in a console show
2011-01-12T00:17:00.000Z	acicula_	cognitiaclaeves	>rfkill list< even
2011-01-12T00:17:00.000Z	cognitiaclaeves	acicula_	there's a paste script in 10.4, isn't there?

2011-01-12T00:20:00.000Z	acicula_	cognitiaclaeves	right then its not that then(means both are not switched off physically or via software)
2011-01-12T00:21:00.000Z	cognitiaclaeves	acicula_	FWIW, I see the LED on. :p
2011-01-12T00:23:00.000Z	acicula_	cognitiaclaeves	dunno then why it is not working, can you try a previous kernel revision or is the one you have the only one?
2011-01-12T00:24:00.000Z	acicula_	cognitiaclaeves	no updates of any kind?
2011-01-12T00:25:00.000Z	cognitiaclaeves	acicula_	No, I think it might have happened after an update.
2011-01-12T00:25:00.000Z	acicula_	cognitiaclaeves	reboot and try an older kernel, should still be there if you updated
2011-01-12T00:26:00.000Z	cognitiaclaeves	acicula_	Ok.  I'll try that when I can.  Thanks for the help!
2011-01-12T00:26:00.000Z	acicula_	cognitiaclaeves	yw
2011-01-12T00:27:00.000Z	cognitiaclaeves	acicula_	... If it turns out to be an update of some sort that caused it, is there a way to get a list of what was updated?  ( maybe a log for apt? )
2011-01-12T00:27:00.000Z	acicula_	cognitiaclaeves	there is an apt log yeah
2011-01-12T00:28:00.000Z	acicula_	cognitiaclaeves	/var/log/apt/ and maybe /var/lib/apt
2011-01-12T00:29:00.000Z	cognitiaclaeves	acicula_	Is the apt log updated for updates not done directly by the user through bash?
2011-01-12T00:30:00.000Z	acicula_	cognitiaclaeves	i assume so
2011-01-12T00:30:00.000Z	cognitiaclaeves	acicula_	Ok.  Thanks again.  Have a good one!
