2005-12-12T12:32:00.000Z	frogzoo	kayde	that gfx card is pretty old - I'd reckon if you google cyber 9525 you'll find useful stuff
2005-12-12T12:38:00.000Z	frogzoo	kayde	have you played with xconfs b4? this should be very close 2 your needs http://linux-on-laptops.com/forum/archive/index.php/t-135.html
2005-12-12T12:45:00.000Z	frogzoo	kayde	the xorg.conf file there will be quite similiar to yours - you could even try swapping it directly into /etc/X11/xorg.conf, reboot & x your fingers
2005-12-12T12:57:00.000Z	frogzoo	kayde	sudo vi /etc/x11/xorg.conf
2005-12-12T12:59:00.000Z	frogzoo	kayde	sudo vi /etc/X11/xorg.conf
