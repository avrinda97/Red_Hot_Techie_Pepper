2012-11-05T01:15:00.000Z	mllie		hello
2012-11-05T01:17:00.000Z	mllie		I've just made an upgrade from 8.x to 10.x LTS and now the screen is just black after the text that loads the kernel after grub has disappeared. How do I do to debug this?
2012-11-05T01:18:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	mllie	Do you know how to insert nomodeset in the kernel at grub, to get a low graphics boot.
2012-11-05T01:19:00.000Z	mllie	wilee-nilee	no?
2012-11-05T01:19:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	mllie	 ^^^
2012-11-05T01:27:00.000Z	mllie	wilee-nilee	still same problem
2012-11-05T01:28:00.000Z	mllie	wilee-nilee	I get this error just before the screen goes black I think: http://askubuntu.com/questions/182371/12-04-1-error-after-upgrade
2012-11-05T01:35:00.000Z	mllie	wilee-nilee	any idea?
2012-11-05T01:36:00.000Z	mllie	wilee-nilee	yes, didn't you see my message above? I tried that one without any success
2012-11-05T01:36:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	mllie	The link in the ots message will tell you how to insert the nomodeset in the kernel at boot.
2012-11-05T01:37:00.000Z	mllie	wilee-nilee	still same problem. I get this error just before the screen goes black I think: http://askubuntu.com/questions/182371/12-04-1-error-after-upgrade
2012-11-05T01:38:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	mllie	Is that your actual post>
2012-11-05T01:38:00.000Z	mllie	wilee-nilee	no, but same error message
2012-11-05T01:39:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	mllie	I would go to the ubuntu forums and start a thread as well, the channel may or may not be your best help, I can't really help here myself, I thought this was just a black screen.
2012-11-05T01:40:00.000Z	mllie	wilee-nilee	well, how do I get into command line when booting then?
2012-11-05T01:42:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	mllie	You can get to a command line from the recovery kernel in the grub menu, hold down the shift key at boot if grub is not showing, I believe there is a mount needed here I think the hD is read only in the recovery to begin with these days.
2012-11-05T01:42:00.000Z	mllie	wilee-nilee	ok, boot recovery kernel and then? It stops at black screen there as well
2012-11-05T01:43:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	mllie	The only thing I know here is how to insert nomodeset in the kernel to possibly get a low graphics situation.
2012-11-05T01:44:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	mllie	This is beyond my help honestly. ;)
