2008-03-10T23:51:00.000Z	Devourer		Does Ubuntu automatically compensate for day light savings?
2008-03-10T23:51:00.000Z	xarquid	Devourer	If you have Time Sync turned on (to sync with a time server such a nist.gov)
2008-03-10T23:52:00.000Z	Devourer	xarquid	how do I do that?
2008-03-10T23:52:00.000Z	xarquid	Devourer	Are you using Gnome and is your Gnome Clock Applet running in a corner? (I am just assuming all of this)...
2008-03-10T23:52:00.000Z	Devourer	xarquid	yes.
2008-03-10T23:53:00.000Z	xarquid	Devourer	Actually, check this out: http://www.watchingthenet.com/enable-auto-time-synchronization-in-ubuntu-and-kubuntu.html - a good graphical guide for you.
2008-03-10T23:53:00.000Z	xarquid	Devourer	And then you'll be good to go.
2008-03-10T23:54:00.000Z	Devourer	xarquid	thanks.
2008-03-10T23:55:00.000Z	xarquid	Devourer	The above link may also help (the first link). If the one I gave you didn't help, but just keep it in mind. Have a great one and always ask back here if you need any help.
2008-03-11T00:01:00.000Z	Devourer	xarquid	lol, ok I set it to sync with the ubuntu ntp server but it still hasn't updated.
2008-03-11T00:02:00.000Z	xarquid	Devourer	Perhaps try a different server?
2008-03-11T00:02:00.000Z	Devourer	xarquid	I tried some others.
2008-03-11T00:02:00.000Z	Devourer	xarquid	what was that one you said? The ntp.nstc.gov or w/e?
2008-03-11T00:03:00.000Z	xarquid	Devourer	Have a look there on the first link, it lists some
2008-03-11T00:03:00.000Z	Devourer	xarquid	what first link?
2008-03-11T00:04:00.000Z	xarquid	Devourer	What ubot said what after me ( https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuTime )
2008-03-11T00:05:00.000Z	Devourer	xarquid	that page is forbidden.
2008-03-11T00:06:00.000Z	Devourer	xarquid	I get a 403 error.
2008-03-11T00:06:00.000Z	xarquid	Devourer	http://doc.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/serverguide/C/NTP.html try that doc.
