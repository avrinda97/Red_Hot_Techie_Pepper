2012-09-17T04:02:00.000Z	k1l_	nannes	there should be alot of howtos from the days were gdm was the standard. did you try these?
2012-09-17T04:02:00.000Z	nannes	k1l_	they're all old, didn't try
2012-09-17T04:03:00.000Z	k1l_	nannes	old doesnt mean that the dont work
2012-09-17T04:03:00.000Z	k1l_	nannes	there hardly wont be new, because lightdm is standard now
2012-09-17T04:04:00.000Z	nannes	k1l_	LightDM too is a bull**** ... Or better, ubuntu version sucks cause it's not configurable!  I don't know why devs put the hands where they shouldn't.    Linux must be free and totally customizable , and ubuntu's lightdm isn't that waY!!!
2012-09-17T04:05:00.000Z	k1l_	nannes	that is way offtopic.
2012-09-17T04:06:00.000Z	k1l_	nannes	but you are telling me, that you demand newest howtos for not-standard software? i dont see your problem here
2012-09-17T04:07:00.000Z	k1l_	nannes	no
2012-09-17T04:07:00.000Z	k1l_	nannes	you were demanding brand new how tos for gdm :/
2012-09-17T04:07:00.000Z	nannes	k1l_	Those howtos were written in the Lucid period  lol
2012-09-17T04:08:00.000Z	k1l_	nannes	and where is the problem?
2012-09-17T04:08:00.000Z	k1l_	nannes	doenst it work anymore?
2012-09-17T04:09:00.000Z	k1l_	nannes	the old howtos arent outdated. so go with that
2012-09-17T04:15:00.000Z	k1l_	nannes	you should face the howtos, tbh
2012-09-17T04:16:00.000Z	nannes	k1l_	I'm doing it :P
2012-09-17T04:16:00.000Z	nannes	k1l_	I just throw many of them out because they were talking about .conf files that don't even exist
2012-09-17T04:18:00.000Z	k1l_	nannes	if there were no .conf files just make them.
2012-09-17T04:19:00.000Z	nannes	k1l_	No, I bet they're just anywhere else. Cause ubuntu also change configuration-file's names ;)
2012-09-17T04:19:00.000Z	k1l_	nannes	alot of stuff gets automatic configuration and doesnt need .conf files as long as the user doesnt want to change smth
