2011-09-02T03:31:00.000Z	mickster04	dasrs	try chrome?
2011-09-02T03:32:00.000Z	mickster04	dasrs	well i am on windows and running chrome and it worked
2011-09-02T03:32:00.000Z	dasrs	mickster04	i use chrome, but it didnt work.
2011-09-02T03:32:00.000Z	mickster04	dasrs	ah well... i amand it did...so not sure what that's about
2011-09-02T03:33:00.000Z	dasrs	mickster04	really? if you press a cursor key, the cube move?
2011-09-02T03:34:00.000Z	mickster04	dasrs	yeah
2011-09-02T03:38:00.000Z	mickster04	dasrs	there is chromium and chrome i think, depending on which repos you have listed
2011-09-02T03:40:00.000Z	mickster04	dasrs	uhm. not certain I can't remember what, if at all the difference was
2011-09-02T03:43:00.000Z	mickster04	dasrs	ave you tried turning it off and on again?
2011-09-02T03:43:00.000Z	mickster04	dasrs	maybe it was working, but really slowly
2011-09-02T03:44:00.000Z	mickster04	dasrs	i dunno if you know but pressing keyboard keys changes the speed and angle of rotation, so maybe you held it down?
2011-09-02T03:44:00.000Z	dasrs	mickster04	wait
2011-09-02T03:46:00.000Z	dasrs	mickster04	does it work? http://jsfiddle.net/Eimer/cXDFT/
2011-09-02T03:47:00.000Z	dasrs	mickster04	does the cube rotate if you click on "Click me to move".
2011-09-02T03:47:00.000Z	mickster04	dasrs	no
2011-09-02T03:50:00.000Z	dasrs	mickster04	i start my virtual windows XP, open chrome aaaaannnnnddd -> it did NOT work. oooh my god.
