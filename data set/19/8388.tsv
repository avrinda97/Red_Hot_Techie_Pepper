2008-01-06T09:18:00.000Z	Nubbie	rodolfo	install ubuntu-main-menu, it comes with an applications browser and a preferences/administration browser.
2008-01-06T09:19:00.000Z	rodolfo	Nubbie	where can i get some more info about this?
2008-01-06T09:19:00.000Z	Nubbie	rodolfo	there is a DSL manager available, but it contains restricted code.
2008-01-06T09:20:00.000Z	rodolfo	Nubbie	Sun's?
2008-01-06T09:21:00.000Z	Nubbie	rodolfo	you can install the main-menu, purely for the app/settings browsers and not use the panel applet should you choose to.
2008-01-06T09:22:00.000Z	rodolfo	Nubbie	any idea of why this does not come already installed with Ubuntu?
2008-01-06T09:22:00.000Z	Nubbie	rodolfo	nope.
2008-01-06T09:23:00.000Z	Nubbie	rodolfo	IMO, the menu bar set up is highly effective and perhaps the ubuntu devs feel it unnecessary.
2008-01-06T09:26:00.000Z	rodolfo	Nubbie	nm-applet is a good, but very "instable" network manager(very complicated when setting up an wireless connection). i took a look at it's site and the current version(which comes wih Ubuntu) isn't that good thing. On the other hand, Sun's network monitor is...good =/
2008-01-06T09:28:00.000Z	Nubbie	rodolfo	i have never had issues with network manager.
2008-01-06T09:28:00.000Z	Nubbie	rodolfo	no crashes, no connection issues, nothing.
2008-01-06T09:30:00.000Z	rodolfo	Nubbie	I use to travel a lot and when trying to get connected with public wireless network (hotels) it just does not work. it detects the network, but it just does not connect.
2008-01-06T09:32:00.000Z	Nubbie	rodolfo	you need to select a network before it will connect. it is not in the habit of connecting to random unsecured wireless networks without user intervention.
2008-01-06T09:34:00.000Z	rodolfo	Nubbie	I usually do that. click once on the icon from the notification area and type my password...but it seems it tries to connect but for some reason it not only does not work but also does not return me any error message
2008-01-06T09:34:00.000Z	Nubbie	rodolfo	i agree Network Manager could use some more (ANY) effective error messages.
2008-01-06T09:35:00.000Z	rodolfo	Nubbie	yeah. so...what about this drdsl? have you experienced some crash using it or it works just fine?
2008-01-06T09:36:00.000Z	Nubbie	rodolfo	i use routers to connect to my DSL, so i don't have any experience with drdsl. i just knew of it's existance.
2008-01-06T09:57:00.000Z	Nubbie	rodolfo	that is true.
2008-01-06T09:57:00.000Z	Nubbie	rodolfo	because running KDE apps in GNOME requires both gnome and KDE services to be running.
