2008-02-05T05:53:00.000Z	dhanar_10		i have a problem with xine and mkv. when playing mkv files, the sound is skipping. anyone experiences this too?
2008-02-05T05:53:00.000Z	danielski_pl	dhanar_10	use vlc
2008-02-05T05:55:00.000Z	dhanar_10	danielski_pl	i want to know if anyone experiences my problem too... btw, i don't like the interface of vlc... it's a matter of taste...
2008-02-05T05:56:00.000Z	danielski_pl	dhanar_10	i havent experienced that in xine but vlc has choppy video
2008-02-05T05:57:00.000Z	dhanar_10	danielski_pl	what is your xine-lib version? so you can play mkv files smoothly with xine, huh?
2008-02-05T06:00:00.000Z	danielski_pl	dhanar_10	how do i check that?
2008-02-05T06:01:00.000Z	dhanar_10	danielski_pl	open system>admin>synaptic and search for "xine"
2008-02-05T06:04:00.000Z	danielski_pl	dhanar_10	couldnt find xine-lib in synaptic but i found others and they are 1.1.7
2008-02-05T06:05:00.000Z	danielski_pl	dhanar_10	im viewing LOST S04E01 and there is no sign of choppiness in audio or video like in vlc
2008-02-05T06:07:00.000Z	danielski_pl		how do i stop ubuntu from starting in low graphics mode?
2008-02-05T06:07:00.000Z	dhanar_10	danielski_pl	in ubuntu, xine-lib is libxine... same here 1.1.7... so your mkv files play smoothly, huh? i'm viewing gundam 00 mkv (h264+aac) and patlabor mkv (xvid+mp3). the sound is skipping, especially in opening and closing song...
2008-02-05T06:10:00.000Z	danielski_pl	dhanar_10	mine only chops once at the start of the movie between 00:01 and 00:08 and thats it, no more skips after that thats not a prob to me though
2008-02-05T06:12:00.000Z	dhanar_10	danielski_pl	i see... so it's just me... strange... ok, thank you anyway. for now i will just avoid mkv files....

2008-02-05T06:19:00.000Z	danielski_pl		how do i stop ubuntu from starting in low graphics mode??
2008-02-05T06:20:00.000Z	dhanar_10	danielski_pl	it's ok. besides mkv is relatively new, right? i just have to be patient... i still have a lot if time...
2008-02-05T06:22:00.000Z	danielski_pl	dhanar_10	its the first time ive heard of .mkv after downloading that LOST ep
2008-02-05T06:24:00.000Z	dhanar_10	danielski_pl	yeah, it is really new and its advantages is it can store any video and audio format + subtitle. i heard that ibm has bought it. um... i think it's getting off topic...
