2010-05-02T03:18:00.000Z	rahduke		can anyone help me figure out why I can't double click .run and .sh files in nautilus and have them open in terminal or run? it just keeps opening gedit.... I just upgraded to 10.04
2010-05-02T03:18:00.000Z	shtirlic	rahduke	is it have executable permission?
2010-05-02T03:18:00.000Z	rahduke	shtirlic	sure do

2010-05-02T03:20:00.000Z	shtirlic	rahduke	hm works for me
2010-05-02T03:20:00.000Z	rahduke	shtirlic	yea, im buggin out i dont know whats rong
2010-05-02T03:21:00.000Z	rahduke	shtirlic	this issue could cause me to have to start all over.... I think my problem stems from using the same home folder as 9.10 and user name.... when i installed i wiped my ubuntu parition and did a clean installthen pointed fstab to my old home folder on a different partition
2010-05-02T03:23:00.000Z	shtirlic	rahduke	so maybe permissions issue set it to 777 and see
2010-05-02T03:24:00.000Z	rahduke	shtirlic	i've set the files to 775
2010-05-02T03:24:00.000Z	shtirlic	rahduke	try 777
2010-05-02T03:24:00.000Z	rahduke	shtirlic	should i 777 my entire home folder?
2010-05-02T03:25:00.000Z	shtirlic	rahduke	so it's working with 777?
2010-05-02T03:26:00.000Z	rahduke	shtirlic	actionparsnip says dont 777 anything
2010-05-02T03:26:00.000Z	shtirlic	rahduke	yeeh but for test u can always do this
2010-05-02T03:26:00.000Z	shtirlic	rahduke	in longterm it's bad to use 777
2010-05-02T03:28:00.000Z	shtirlic	rahduke	do u understand why i suggest u to test with 777 mode?
2010-05-02T03:32:00.000Z	shtirlic	rahduke	beacause you files doesn't belong to you try chown them
2010-05-02T03:33:00.000Z	rahduke	shtirlic	can i chown recursivly? if so how
2010-05-02T03:33:00.000Z	shtirlic	rahduke	man chown
