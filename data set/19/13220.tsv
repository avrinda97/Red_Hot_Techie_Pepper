2005-12-15T17:53:00.000Z	senectus		hello again everyone. I've just swapped my mainboard and processor out and rebooted and the PC has come up with most stuff working fine.. except for my x.org/nvidia AGP card.. is there some way I can make it auto detect and resetup every thing again?

2005-12-15T06:06:00.000Z	senectus	dragoon	do you want the xserver output? (last few lines anyhow)?
2005-12-15T06:06:00.000Z	dragoon	senectus	yea that would help :)
2005-12-15T06:07:00.000Z	senectus	dragoon	ahh crap.. I know what I've done wrong :-P I haven't attached the extrnal power to it.. sorry for wasting your time :-P

2005-12-15T06:18:00.000Z	senectus	dragoon	ok gdm starts A-okay now, then when I log in I get a brown screen with a mouse pointer.. thats it.. No icons I got no "loading splash" or anything..
2005-12-15T06:19:00.000Z	dragoon	senectus	have you something like gnome installed
2005-12-15T06:20:00.000Z	senectus	dragoon	something like? I have a full Ubuntu install no real customisations other than non-free drivers like the nvidia
2005-12-15T06:21:00.000Z	senectus	dragoon	that is to say... the normal ubuntu desktop which is Gnome
