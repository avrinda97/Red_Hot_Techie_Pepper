2006-12-16T06:15:00.000Z	jovans		hello i am using edgy ubuntu i have installed from the ubuntu repo nvidia-glx
2006-12-16T06:16:00.000Z	jovans		but on dep. now its using 2.6.19-7-386 instaed of generic is this normal
2006-12-16T06:17:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	jovans	run 'nvidia-glx-config enable' to enable it. and change all the 386 stuff (kernels, headers, restricted) from 386 to generic
2006-12-16T06:18:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	jovans	yes, and install the -generic packages in their place
2006-12-16T06:19:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	jovans	just make sure you install all the generic packages and boot them before you remove the current runing kernel
2006-12-16T06:28:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	jovans	a kernel with dirrekt preempt than the regular
2006-12-16T06:29:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	jovans	its for low latency systems, like those for music production
2006-12-16T06:29:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	jovans	if you want (need) low latency its a performance boost. if you dont, its a degradation
2006-12-16T06:30:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	jovans	yes
2006-12-16T06:31:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	jovans	where did you find it? running feisty, are you?
2006-12-16T06:31:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	jovans	i though you would. it shouldnt be in edgy :)
2006-12-16T06:32:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	jovans	cheleb feisty talk should be in #ubuntu+1
