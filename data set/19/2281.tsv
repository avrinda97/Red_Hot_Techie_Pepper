2010-05-10T21:30:00.000Z	heli		there is no image on the screen , i try with vlc too seems not working
2010-05-10T21:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	heli	 totally depends on the codecs of the avi files.
2010-05-10T21:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	heli	 for starters install the 'ubuntu-restricted-extras' package and the w32codecs from medibuntu
2010-05-10T21:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	heli	 run vlc ffrom terminal,  load video.. look for error messages.
2010-05-10T21:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	heli	 just to clear the air.. this isent some Porn video from some XXX site/source is it?
2010-05-10T21:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	heli	 'with windows' dosent really prove much. Theres dozens+ of codecs that  may not be common on linux.
2010-05-10T21:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	heli	 run a player in a terminal. play video. look at what codecs it says its using.
2010-05-10T21:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	heli	 why would you need to be root?
2010-05-10T21:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	heli	 did you try to play  that video in it?
2010-05-10T21:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	heli	 it should give some info as you play teh video
2010-05-10T21:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	heli	 in vlc as its playing you can go to tools -> 'media information' and see what codecs its using also
2010-05-10T21:48:00.000Z	heli	Dr_Willis	 the codec is mpga
2010-05-10T21:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	heli	 audio codec is what? video codec is what?
2010-05-10T21:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	heli	 where did mpga come from? :)   so audio is NOT working ? but video is.
2010-05-10T21:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	heli	 xvid should work fine.  try the thing in 'gnome-mplayer' also..
2010-05-10T21:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	heli	 does mplayer give any erorr messages at the terminal?
