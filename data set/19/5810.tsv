2008-11-21T05:46:00.000Z	fde	raven	says the resize worked
2008-11-21T05:48:00.000Z	raven	fde	well it didnt... when i rebooted to a usb ubuntu to repartition the ubuntu partition to take the freespace, it was back on windows
2008-11-21T05:49:00.000Z	fde	raven	I believe the installer should be able to resize the partition too... hit custom and try... nothing is written until you hit Ok or Next or whatever it says
2008-11-21T05:50:00.000Z	fde	raven	actually it doesn't apply anything until its done asking questions... it presents the entire process that you've requested etc... just make sure NTFS is defragmented
2008-11-21T05:50:00.000Z	raven	fde	it hasnt been defragged..... ever
2008-11-21T05:50:00.000Z	fde	raven	then boot to Windows and do it... else you'll probably lose data if you try resizing it
2008-11-21T05:51:00.000Z	raven	fde	 the installer resized it on original install w/o prob..
2008-11-21T05:52:00.000Z	fde	raven	defragmentation occurs when files on an NTFS partition become dis-contiguous, which means the data is scattered across the drive rather than neatly at the begginning... which means some could be at the end where you're trying to shrink it....
2008-11-21T05:53:00.000Z	fde	raven	bad time to be lazy unless you don't care about screwing up your NTFS partition?
2008-11-21T05:53:00.000Z	raven	fde	don't care THAT much
2008-11-21T05:53:00.000Z	raven	fde	it'd be nice if i didnt lose it tho
2008-11-21T05:54:00.000Z	fde	raven	I'm talking about there is a risk it'll never boot again
2008-11-21T05:54:00.000Z	fde	raven	just because you don't want to defrag
2008-11-21T05:54:00.000Z	fde	raven	there is no telling what might be at the end of the drive...
2008-11-21T05:55:00.000Z	fde	raven	any important dll's though, or the kernel itself... very bad for you
2008-11-21T05:55:00.000Z	raven	fde	don't care about the OS lol
2008-11-21T05:55:00.000Z	raven	fde	i am a windows expert, i can fix the OS easy
2008-11-21T05:55:00.000Z	raven	fde	it's my saved games im worried about most, but they arent the end of the world
2008-11-21T05:55:00.000Z	fde	raven	ok, great... then knock yourself out
