2010-07-05T00:15:00.000Z	ThatGuyOverThere		I'm trying to install BURG. Anybody wanna help me with that?
2010-07-05T00:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ThatGuyOverThere	I believe omgubuntu has a guide
2010-07-05T00:15:00.000Z	ThatGuyOverThere	ActionParsnip	I know, but I'm having trouble understanding the first step.
2010-07-05T00:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ThatGuyOverThere	ok, how many drives do you have?
2010-07-05T00:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ThatGuyOverThere	you are confusing partitions with drives
2010-07-05T00:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ThatGuyOverThere	how many physiclal drives do you have?
2010-07-05T00:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ThatGuyOverThere	then its hd0 as there is only one option
2010-07-05T00:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ThatGuyOverThere	burg as far as I've read is a replacement for grub
2010-07-05T00:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ThatGuyOverThere	if you had a 2nd drive it could possibly be hd1, but you only have one drive so the option you need is hd0
2010-07-05T00:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ThatGuyOverThere	change the keyserver to gpg.mit.edu
2010-07-05T00:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ThatGuyOverThere	it authenticates the packages. Also upgrading to the next distro will not be allowed
2010-07-05T00:25:00.000Z	ThatGuyOverThere	ActionParsnip	How do I add the key later?
2010-07-05T00:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ThatGuyOverThere	same command on the guide. I don't have what guide you are using so can't verify
2010-07-05T00:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ThatGuyOverThere	i'd just keep hammering it, keyserver.ubuntu.com get a lot of hammer
2010-07-05T00:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ThatGuyOverThere	if it uses the add-apt-repository command then it will add the key but it needs to complete to get the repo added
2010-07-05T00:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ThatGuyOverThere	I've not installed it. I don't even dual boot. Read the guide dude
2010-07-05T00:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ThatGuyOverThere	then find a different guide, see what it says
2010-07-05T00:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ThatGuyOverThere	http://www.ubuntugeek.com/how-to-change-your-grub-loader-view-using-burg.html
2010-07-05T00:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ThatGuyOverThere	looks comprehensive, even has the key lines :)
