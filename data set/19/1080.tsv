2011-09-22T08:57:00.000Z	Shikhin		This is really weird. Something was leaking, and I had only few MiB of free space remaining. Somebody suggested me to use Bleachbit, and I did. However, recently, I find that I run bleachbit and in few seconds th free space drops from 12GiB to 12MiB.
2011-09-22T08:57:00.000Z	Shikhin		HELP.
2011-09-22T08:58:00.000Z	Shikhin		:-)
2011-09-22T08:58:00.000Z	Shikhin		(prior to that HELP)
2011-09-22T08:58:00.000Z	zephyr	Shikhin	Ugh. No.
2011-09-22T08:59:00.000Z	zephyr	Shikhin	Actually, we just can't assist you with anything anyway unless we know YOUR "issue"...
2011-09-22T09:01:00.000Z	Shikhin	zephyr	See, I have a 320GiB hard disk. I have split it into four partitions, with one dedicated to Ubuntu. On this one, I store almost nothing, except the "usual" stuff. I expect it to have around 15-20 GiB free. However, recently, I found out that it had nly 32 MiB free space left. Sinec I don't store much on it, I was surprised. I asked on this channel, and somebody said that BleachBit could "wipe out" unneccessary data. I ran BleachBit, and wo, I had 12.
2011-09-22T09:03:00.000Z	zephyr	Shikhin	I'm not understanding the purpose.    So basically you have a buttload of things on you harddrive, and only have 32MBs left?
2011-09-22T09:05:00.000Z	zephyr	Shikhin	Why? Is it a software that purposely fill up your harddive to overwrite permanent?
2011-09-22T09:06:00.000Z	zephyr	Shikhin	So what's really the purpose of that software that is doing that?
2011-09-22T09:06:00.000Z	Shikhin	zephyr	Urm. I don't know what is doing that. If I did, why would I be asking here?
2011-09-22T09:07:00.000Z	zephyr	Shikhin	well, if theres nothing important on those partitions, I would just reformat it.
2011-09-22T09:08:00.000Z	Shikhin	zephyr	I have Ubuntu installed on that partition - which shows that error.
2011-09-22T09:09:00.000Z	zephyr	Shikhin	 Harddrives are like               STONE WALLS.       You write data. You delete it.     You can recover it, The only way to make sure no one can recover it, you have to damage the entire stone wall.
2011-09-22T09:10:00.000Z	zephyr	Shikhin	A software purposely writes random useless junk data filling up your harddrive, to OVERWRITE  "freespace".  So it will not be possible to recover deleted files from "freespace".
2011-09-22T09:11:00.000Z	Shikhin	zephyr	How does that relate to my problem, again?
2011-09-22T09:12:00.000Z	zephyr	Shikhin	You mentioned something is Eating up your harddrive. I can not imagine any linux software that would do that other than a Permanent file deletion tool.
2011-09-22T09:13:00.000Z	zephyr	Shikhin	Why not just read a file that's occupying your diskspace to figure out what it is. o_o
2011-09-22T09:13:00.000Z	Shikhin	zephyr	The problem occured before I started using Bleachbit (which I used to try to solve the problem - clearing up space).
