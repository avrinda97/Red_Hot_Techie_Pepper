2006-07-19T13:48:00.000Z	pse		No thoughts on why my router can't detect my box's hostname?
2006-07-19T13:49:00.000Z	pse		Nah, regular type.
2006-07-19T13:49:00.000Z	pse		Or, yes, it's a wireless router, but the conneciton is wired.
2006-07-19T13:50:00.000Z	pse		I think you misunderstood. It's all wired. Everything works fine, and it's all dandy. Except the hostname just doesn't show up in the list.
2006-07-19T13:52:00.000Z	ic56	pse	look into the linux box's dhcp config.  /etc/dhclient.conf  Probably setting option host-name will cause it tell your router by what name the linux box wishes to be known
2006-07-19T13:52:00.000Z	pse		Ahhhh. I see.
2006-07-19T13:53:00.000Z	pse		Thanks.
2006-07-19T13:54:00.000Z	pse		Aha. That did it.
2006-07-19T13:54:00.000Z	pse		Well, that's... exciting.
2006-07-19T13:54:00.000Z	pse		Mystery solved.
2006-07-19T13:54:00.000Z	pse	ic56	do you know of any reason why the name isn't transmitted by default?
2006-07-19T13:55:00.000Z	pse		Oh.
2006-07-19T13:55:00.000Z	pse		Hummm.
2006-07-19T13:55:00.000Z	pse		I didn't realize dhcp could assign names as well.
2006-07-19T13:55:00.000Z	pse		I guess there's my answer.
2006-07-19T13:56:00.000Z	ic56	pse	yes.  By default, the system administrator doesn't care what the box or the box's user wants.  The admin assigns the correct hostnames via DNS.
2006-07-19T13:56:00.000Z	pse		Well. Neat. You learn something new everyday. Thanks a bunch.
2006-07-19T13:56:00.000Z	pse		Ciao, all.
2006-07-19T13:57:00.000Z	ic56	pse	I mean, of course, the site administrator -- not the individual box's admin
