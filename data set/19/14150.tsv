2005-02-08T08:33:00.000Z	theine		or neither?
2005-02-08T08:34:00.000Z	theine		billytwobilly: Go Oilers I guess?
2005-02-08T08:35:00.000Z	theine		me too
2005-02-08T08:36:00.000Z	theine		billytwobilly: talk to me, the build in ate card is the only thing i hate about about my laptop
2005-02-08T08:37:00.000Z	theine		billytwobilly: 9000 M9
2005-02-08T08:39:00.000Z	theine		as it does suck for sure
2005-02-08T08:41:00.000Z	theine		billytwobilly: yes! but they aren't that great i tell you
2005-02-08T08:42:00.000Z	theine		billytwobilly: in term sof performnce i should add
2005-02-08T08:44:00.000Z	theine		billytwobilly: glxgears is very unreliable i think, what matters to me is that i can't run doom 3
2005-02-08T06:57:00.000Z	theine		hmmm, glxinfo says ``direct rendering: No'' all of the sudden. what could be the reason for that?
2005-02-08T06:58:00.000Z	Ex-Cyber	theine	kernel change?
2005-02-08T06:59:00.000Z	theine	Ex-Cyber	yes
2005-02-08T06:59:00.000Z	Ex-Cyber	theine	are you using proprietary drivers? (ati/nvidia)?
2005-02-08T06:59:00.000Z	theine	Ex-Cyber	no, it's all there I think
2005-02-08T07:00:00.000Z	theine	Ex-Cyber	I'm using the open-source raderon drivers anyway
2005-02-08T07:00:00.000Z	Ex-Cyber	theine	I'm not sure what you mean
2005-02-08T07:00:00.000Z	theine	Ex-Cyber	oh sorry, i read ``missing'' instead of ``using''
2005-02-08T07:01:00.000Z	Ex-Cyber	theine	sometimes new kernels break the proprietary drivers
2005-02-08T07:02:00.000Z	theine	Ex-Cyber	wait a minute, now i remember, I have to un-install xorg-driver-fglrx
