2010-06-21T09:29:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl		jeruvy: they don't allow routers
2010-06-21T09:29:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl		jeruvy: and even so, what address?
2010-06-21T09:30:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl		jeruvy: I'm guessing 127.0.0.1 is not the proper address, right
2010-06-21T09:30:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl		?
2010-06-21T09:31:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl		jeruvy: no addresses in ifconfig
2010-06-21T09:31:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl		jeruvy: one sec, I see two, but they're under lo, not eth1
2010-06-21T09:31:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl		jeruvy: I see 127.0.0.1 and 255.0.0.0
2010-06-21T09:32:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl		jeruvy: ok, I'm pinging 127.0.0.1, what should I be seeing if it's working?
2010-06-21T09:33:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl		jeruvy: apparently neither, as both are giving me permission denied, then when I tried sudo, it says "Ignoring unknown interface eth1=eth1"
2010-06-21T09:34:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl		jeruvy: and again, what am I supposed to see in the ping?
2010-06-21T09:34:00.000Z	r007	jdsbluedevl	type this and give us your output  lshw -C network
2010-06-21T09:35:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl	r007	I have to transfer via thumb drive, give me a few minutes
2010-06-21T09:37:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl		jeruvy: well, I'm getting something that says "64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=X ttl=Y time=Z ms"
2010-06-21T09:37:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl		jeruvy: then I don't have a network connection
2010-06-21T09:39:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl	r007	http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/452766/
2010-06-21T09:40:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl		jeruvy: no, it was working fine and dany 2 weeks ago.  Then the network sharing that I was using for my Roku got borked, I did a fresh install of Ubuntu, and now no Internet connection
2010-06-21T09:40:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl		jeruvy: and when I plug the connection into my MacBook, it works quite well
2010-06-21T09:41:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl	r007	did you get the pastebin?
2010-06-21T09:43:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl	r007	did you get the pastebin?
