2011-02-08T21:31:00.000Z	kaddi		hi, i need help with chroot.. I accidentally deleted all kernels from my ubuntu and I'm now trying to reinstall one by using chroot from live-cd. However when I run apt-get it says: "error while loading shared libraries: libapt-pkg-libc6.10-6.so.4.8 can not ope shared object file: No such file or directory." Both the live-cd and the install are kubuntu maverick 64bit
2011-02-08T21:32:00.000Z	kaddi		one sec, will do ChogyDan
2011-02-08T21:34:00.000Z	juk	kaddi	you deleted what?
2011-02-08T21:34:00.000Z	kaddi	juk	the kernels.. I wanted to delete mz old kernels and used a bad command
2011-02-08T21:36:00.000Z	juk	kaddi	ah old kernel
2011-02-08T21:40:00.000Z	juk	kaddi	what was the command to delete old kernel?
2011-02-08T21:42:00.000Z	kaddi	juk	apt-get remove 2.6.33* it will remove 2.6.35 too
2011-02-08T21:43:00.000Z	juk	kaddi	is it linux image?
2011-02-08T21:44:00.000Z	kaddi	juk	what do you mean?
2011-02-08T21:44:00.000Z	juk	kaddi	i mean you can't just purge 2.6.*
2011-02-08T21:45:00.000Z	juk	kaddi	and sounds a bit nuts
2011-02-08T21:45:00.000Z	kaddi	juk	 well apparently you can.. cause that's what happened. I did not delete 2.6 I wanted to delete 2.6.33* and realised too late that the expression 2.6.33 also matches 2.6.35
2011-02-08T21:47:00.000Z	juk	kaddi	expression you just gave is wont do anything like that
2011-02-08T21:48:00.000Z	juk	kaddi	theres package linux-generic it's just docs
2011-02-08T21:50:00.000Z	kaddi	juk	erUSUL  that's from the live-cd pastebin.com/KvhbGzA8 that's the command I used. check what they want to remove.
2011-02-08T21:53:00.000Z	kaddi	juk	erUSUL  correct link http://pastebin.com/KvhbGzA8 It wasn't the behaviour i expected either otherwise i wouldn't have pressed yes
2011-02-08T21:54:00.000Z	juk	kaddi	you dont make sense stop it
2011-02-08T21:54:00.000Z	kaddi	juk	run the command on your own pc and check for yourself.. it's not rocketscience.. just copy it
2011-02-08T21:59:00.000Z	juk	kaddi	i got it that very bad idea to hit Y when not understanding the consecuences
