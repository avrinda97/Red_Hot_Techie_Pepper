2006-02-25T10:28:00.000Z	GoDawgs		hey guys... what does this mean:   Depends: kdelibs4c2 but it is not going to be installed
2006-02-25T10:29:00.000Z	packet	GoDawgs	it means that you have a dependency conflict
2006-02-25T10:29:00.000Z	GoDawgs	packet	Thank you.  Do you know how to resolve it?
2006-02-25T10:29:00.000Z	GoDawgs	packet	or rather how I can fix it... :)
2006-02-25T10:30:00.000Z	packet	GoDawgs	have you mixed your repositories? It's very hard to solve circular dependencies most of the time
2006-02-25T10:31:00.000Z	GoDawgs	packet	what do you mean by mixing them?
2006-02-25T10:31:00.000Z	GoDawgs	packet	I went through the sourceo-matic to create my repos
2006-02-25T10:31:00.000Z	packet		the sources in your sources.list file
2006-02-25T10:31:00.000Z	packet		the places you download your programs from
2006-02-25T10:31:00.000Z	GoDawgs	packet	here i'll copy and paste it in the pastebin .. just a sec
2006-02-25T10:32:00.000Z	GoDawgs	packet	actually it's installing something right now so hold on a minute... ok?
2006-02-25T10:33:00.000Z	GoDawgs	packet	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/8933
2006-02-25T10:35:00.000Z	packet		wow GoDawgs I have to say that with that many sources there is no way to know where the conflict introduced itself.
2006-02-25T10:35:00.000Z	GoDawgs		ahh... crap
2006-02-25T10:35:00.000Z	GoDawgs		ok...
2006-02-25T10:35:00.000Z	GoDawgs	packet	so just start deleting and see what happens?
2006-02-25T10:35:00.000Z	packet		what I mean is: one program is dependent on one file that another program won't tolerate etc, etc.
2006-02-25T10:36:00.000Z	packet		vicious circle
2006-02-25T10:36:00.000Z	GoDawgs	packet	I'm surprised you say that's a lot of sources... I understand many people have up to 50-75
