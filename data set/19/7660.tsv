2007-07-17T07:08:00.000Z	dabaR	x89x	that was raelly cute.
2007-07-17T07:09:00.000Z	dabaR	x89x	do you know how to open a terminal?
2007-07-17T07:10:00.000Z	dabaR	x89x	open one, please. DO you know how to run commands?
2007-07-17T07:10:00.000Z	x89x	dabaR	i want to shift the space
2007-07-17T07:11:00.000Z	dabaR	x89x	good, so you are familiar with the concept. So, please run sudo fdisk -l, and also run ls -ld /media, and ls -l /media
2007-07-17T07:11:00.000Z	dabaR	x89x	once you get the output, please use a http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org page to post it to the Web, and give us a URL, we will read, and let you know what to do.
2007-07-17T07:16:00.000Z	dabaR	x89x	which exact /media directory has that free space?
2007-07-17T07:19:00.000Z	dabaR	x89x	/media itself? I do not think that directory can have free space, because it is a directory, and not a mount p oint.
2007-07-17T07:19:00.000Z	dabaR	x89x	try running df -h.
2007-07-17T07:20:00.000Z	dabaR	x89x	`always paste to the pastebin site, never here, please.
2007-07-17T07:21:00.000Z	dabaR	x89x	you can not write to the media directory itself, why do you think you want to write there?
2007-07-17T07:22:00.000Z	dabaR	x89x	what W_McL is true, it is like saying "I have 10 GB in C:"
2007-07-17T07:22:00.000Z	dabaR	x89x	and "I have 10GB in C:\Program Files" to give a windows comparison
