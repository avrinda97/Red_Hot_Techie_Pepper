2007-09-06T10:29:00.000Z	bluefox83	Py7h0n	i wrote a little python script for xchat and amarok, it's soooo freakin picky =(
2007-09-06T10:30:00.000Z	Py7h0n	bluefox83	I use pyton daily - i take intendation as advantage, as it enforces cleaner code.
2007-09-06T10:31:00.000Z	bluefox83	Py7h0n	could you maybe help me fix my script?
2007-09-06T10:31:00.000Z	Py7h0n	bluefox83	sure, drop it on priv, I'll take a look .
2007-09-06T10:35:00.000Z	bluefox83	Py7h0n	heads up in pm
2007-09-06T10:42:00.000Z	Py7h0n	bluefox83	Soryy, but IRC ate the whole intendation :/
2007-09-06T10:46:00.000Z	bluefox83	Py7h0n	would you prefer i pasted to a pastebot, then gave you the link?
2007-09-06T10:54:00.000Z	Py7h0n	bluefox83	got the code, what's the problem?
2007-09-06T10:55:00.000Z	bluefox83	Py7h0n	when i load it...it displays whatever is playing in amarok once every single second instead of once when the song changes
2007-09-06T10:58:00.000Z	Py7h0n	bluefox83	"if file is not current:" bothers me. What is "file" in this context?
2007-09-06T10:59:00.000Z	bluefox83	Py7h0n	whatever is returned trigger_cb function for file
2007-09-06T10:59:00.000Z	bluefox83	Py7h0n	i want it to return whatever is stored as the playing file
2007-09-06T11:01:00.000Z	Py7h0n	bluefox83	First point - "file" is a name of a function. Don't overwrite it with a variable.
2007-09-06T11:02:00.000Z	bluefox83	Py7h0n	shoudl i rename it to current_file?
2007-09-06T11:04:00.000Z	Py7h0n	bluefox83	Yes, for a beginning. And then - this variable is local for trigger_cb . You won't see it from autoupdate
2007-09-06T11:04:00.000Z	bluefox83	Py7h0n	can i set it to global?
2007-09-06T11:06:00.000Z	bluefox83	Py7h0n	how do i store that so that i can compair it to whatever is actively being played?
2007-09-06T11:08:00.000Z	Py7h0n	bluefox83	"if file is not current:" should now be "if current_file!=current:"
2007-09-06T11:08:00.000Z	bluefox83	Py7h0n	mind if we use #ubuntu-offtopic?
