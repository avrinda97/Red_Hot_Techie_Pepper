2011-05-21T23:24:00.000Z	tanath		anyone know how i can get a list of what shortcuts are on my gnome panel?
2011-05-21T23:25:00.000Z	djustice	tanath	gconf-editor i think. actual items are individual entries in there somewhere iirc.
2011-05-21T23:27:00.000Z	tanath	djustice	thanks!
2011-05-21T23:29:00.000Z	tanath	djustice	erm, now how do i delete items? won't let me
2011-05-21T23:29:00.000Z	tanath	djustice	some editor...
2011-05-21T23:30:00.000Z	djustice	tanath	dunno, sry. im a qt/kde guy. the right click menu once upon a time had a delete item.. :?
2011-05-21T23:30:00.000Z	tanath	djustice	except there is no context menu
2011-05-21T23:32:00.000Z	djustice	tanath	o.o hahaha :) interesting.
2011-05-21T23:33:00.000Z	tanath	djustice	googleing suggests gconftool-2, but that's tedious
2011-05-21T23:33:00.000Z	djustice		question, where are the xscreensavers? the config UI lists them all.. but says they are uninstalled.
2011-05-21T23:34:00.000Z	djustice	tanath	no idea. why can't you edit the panels manually?
2011-05-21T23:34:00.000Z	djustice		sounds like a bug or fail..
2011-05-21T23:35:00.000Z	tanath	djustice	'cause that's the problem... the icon for at least one shortcut has disappeared
2011-05-21T23:35:00.000Z	tanath	djustice	this isn't the first time either, so i'm looking to do some cleanup
2011-05-21T23:36:00.000Z	djustice	tanath	maybe the icon is unavailable at panel creation time? it's located on a seperate partition/device? then gnome automounts it after drawing the panel items? just a guess..
2011-05-21T23:36:00.000Z	djustice		if the normal context menus aren't working, sth else..
2011-05-21T23:36:00.000Z	tanath	djustice	nope
2011-05-21T23:36:00.000Z	djustice		ah. failcake. plasma<3.
2011-05-21T23:37:00.000Z	tanath	djustice	i suspect it's thumbnails getting cleaned up or something...
