2009-10-06T14:19:00.000Z	Drainman		anyone knows how to fix so that ubuntu works with the nikon d300s
2009-10-06T14:19:00.000Z	zaoul	Drainman	what does dmesg say when you plug it in?
2009-10-06T14:21:00.000Z	zaoul	Drainman	dmesg | grep sd
2009-10-06T14:23:00.000Z	Drainman	zaoul	dmesg | tail tells me new "usb 1-3: high speed device using ehci_hcd and address 4"
2009-10-06T14:24:00.000Z	Drainman	zaoul	no...
2009-10-06T14:24:00.000Z	Drainman	zaoul	with f-spot it just says unspecified error
2009-10-06T14:24:00.000Z	Drainman	zaoul	but f-spot uses gphoto2 i think
2009-10-06T14:25:00.000Z	zaoul	Drainman	no /dev/sda1 ?
2009-10-06T14:25:00.000Z	zaoul	Drainman	something you can mount
2009-10-06T14:25:00.000Z	zaoul	Drainman	I've never had much success with gphoto, I've always tried to find devices that work as a mass storage
2009-10-06T14:31:00.000Z	Drainman	zaoul	i got it too work with gphoto2 but only when the device is unmounted
2009-10-06T14:31:00.000Z	zaoul	Drainman	? so you can mount it?
2009-10-06T14:32:00.000Z	Drainman	zaoul	but i see now that i should get a cardreader this drains the battery bad
2009-10-06T14:32:00.000Z	Drainman	zaoul	its not relly mounted
2009-10-06T14:33:00.000Z	Drainman	zaoul	i uses the gphoto://usb[001:003] url
2009-10-06T14:33:00.000Z	zaoul	Drainman	yea if you get a card reader ubuntu should automagically mount a directory onto your desktop
2009-10-06T14:34:00.000Z	Drainman	zaoul	yeah i think that is the best, and a bit faster. the raw files is pretty big :)
2009-10-06T14:35:00.000Z	Drainman	zaoul	Thanks for your support!!
2009-10-06T14:36:00.000Z	zaoul	Drainman	no problem
