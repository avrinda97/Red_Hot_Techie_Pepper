2010-01-30T23:01:00.000Z	erUSUL	Jenk	i've never had any problem with udf disks (video dvd's) even formatted a usb stick with udf and it just works (tm)
2010-01-30T23:02:00.000Z	Jenk	erUSUL	how do you do it ?? how did you read your discs ??
2010-01-30T23:02:00.000Z	erUSUL	Jenk	i just plug or insert them; no other thing is needed
2010-01-30T23:03:00.000Z	erUSUL	Jenk	if you want to manually mount it you would do something like « sudo mount -t udf /dev/scd0 /mount/point/ »
2010-01-30T23:04:00.000Z	Jenk	erUSUL	i've tried that... using auto option, using udf option, it doesn't work...
2010-01-30T23:04:00.000Z	erUSUL	Jenk	what does the kernel says. i.e what what you get from « dmesg | tail » after trying ?

2010-01-30T23:07:00.000Z	erUSUL	Jenk	happens with all dvd you tried ? keep in mind that most data dvd are iso9660 not udf
2010-01-30T23:08:00.000Z	Jenk	erUSUL	all other dvd's have worked so far... but this is my first UDF dvd

2010-01-30T23:11:00.000Z	Jenk	erUSUL	so, can you throw some more light on this ??
2010-01-30T23:14:00.000Z	erUSUL	Jenk	dunno if it only one that fails could be just corrupted
2010-01-30T23:15:00.000Z	Jenk	erUSUL	no, it's the only UDF i've used. how do i check for corruption ?
2011-02-12T01:58:00.000Z	erUSUL	Jenk	install built-essential it includes make
2011-02-12T01:59:00.000Z	Jenk	erUSUL	You meant 'build-essential' I suppose. I have that installed. But gnumake/gmake ?
2011-02-12T02:01:00.000Z	erUSUL	Jenk	gnumke gmake is == make in linux machines. it is called gnumake gmake in bsd (macosx included ) machines becouse they have their own make
2011-02-12T02:02:00.000Z	Jenk	erUSUL	Oops !! Thanks a million ! I was wondering why 'sudo apt-get install gnumake' wasn't working....
2011-02-12T02:02:00.000Z	erUSUL	Jenk	no problem
2011-02-12T02:02:00.000Z	Jenk	erUSUL	:)
