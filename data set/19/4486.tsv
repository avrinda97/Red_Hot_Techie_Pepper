2010-08-16T20:05:00.000Z	bons		i don't get why we have to be cripty to nabs... i think they just need the right inputs
2010-08-16T20:06:00.000Z	bons		*we
2010-08-16T20:06:00.000Z	sacarlson	bons	nabs?
2010-08-16T20:06:00.000Z	sacarlson	bons	newbees?
2010-08-16T20:07:00.000Z	sacarlson	bons	no way for us to know what the asker already knows.  we asume to start that they know all and we just fill in the question
2010-08-16T20:08:00.000Z	bons	sacarlson	we should assume they know nothing
2010-08-16T20:11:00.000Z	sacarlson	bons	It took me 3 days to get my openvpn to work the way I wanted.  there are so many combos of options
2010-08-16T20:12:00.000Z	bons	sacarlson	seems just the case of a basic conf
2010-08-16T20:13:00.000Z	sacarlson	bons	with me it was more than getting openvpn to work you need to setup the routeing around it the way you want the trafic to go
2010-08-16T20:13:00.000Z	bons	sacarlson	sure sacarlson, and the are a lot of different network configuration depending on what you have to do, the net structure and the crypt you need
2010-08-16T20:14:00.000Z	sacarlson	bons	you got it.  just when I got it to ping the other side I thought I was done
2010-08-16T20:14:00.000Z	bons	sacarlson	but thats not the point, you see, we go back to my theme, we should try to make things simple for simple beginners, not think about how complex it can be... this is just unuseful
2010-08-16T20:16:00.000Z	sacarlson	bons	I agree there should be some simple setup at least on the user side.  and why not the server too.  I can't argue that.  I should give you my work if you want to see my configs if it might help.
2010-08-16T20:17:00.000Z	bons	sacarlson	depends just on what you need, in this case abstrakt was just needing to run a preconfigured client, so i don't see where are you aiming too
2010-08-16T20:17:00.000Z	sacarlson	bons	how about you get yours working and give us a ubuntu package that just makes it work on eather a user or server?  I'll try to help you do it.
2010-08-16T20:18:00.000Z	sacarlson	bons	I got what I need I want to make you and abstrakt happy.
2010-08-16T20:18:00.000Z	bons	sacarlson	an ubuntu package? what are you talking about?
2010-08-16T20:19:00.000Z	bons	sacarlson	 i dont need anything i was just helpin abstrakt
2010-08-16T20:31:00.000Z	bons	sacarlson	any output from it?
