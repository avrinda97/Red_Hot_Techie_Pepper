2007-06-08T09:59:00.000Z	DrStrangeLov		arggh...i've borked my system. Did an apt-get upgrade, rebooted, and now i dont have X.
2007-06-08T09:59:00.000Z	DrStrangeLov		i used to have nvidia-glx-legacy. tried reinstalling it- won't work
2007-06-08T10:00:00.000Z	khermans__	DrStrangeLov	nvidia driver issue/
2007-06-08T10:00:00.000Z	khermans__	DrStrangeLov	there is a bug in -16 kernel
2007-06-08T10:00:00.000Z	DrStrangeLov	khermans__	can i roll it back?
2007-06-08T10:00:00.000Z	khermans__	DrStrangeLov	might need to revert to -15, dont know the fix, there is probably an update now
2007-06-08T10:01:00.000Z	DrStrangeLov	khermans__	i have no idea what -16/-15 has to do with the kernel-
2007-06-08T10:01:00.000Z	khermans__	DrStrangeLov	or just make -15 your default in menu.lst
2007-06-08T10:01:00.000Z	khermans__	DrStrangeLov	uname -r
2007-06-08T10:02:00.000Z	khermans__	DrStrangeLov	so not -16 ?
2007-06-08T10:02:00.000Z	khermans__	DrStrangeLov	and it worked in -14 ?
2007-06-08T10:04:00.000Z	DrStrangeLov	khermans__	let me check-i think it could've have had something to do with xorg updates rather than the kernel - cause i didnt do dist-upgrade- a simple upgrade's supposed to keep the kernel intact, right?
2007-06-08T10:04:00.000Z	khermans__	DrStrangeLov	i am unsure, i though upgrade would pull the kernel
2007-06-08T10:10:00.000Z	khermans__	DrStrangeLov	i always use -> aptitude dist-upgrad, never even run plain aptitude upgrade
2007-06-08T10:11:00.000Z	khermans__	DrStrangeLov	mplayer -vo caca
2007-06-08T10:11:00.000Z	DrStrangeLov	khermans__	i'll remember that. well, i think its about to get fixed now- did an update and upgrading now
2007-06-08T10:24:00.000Z	DrStrangeLov	khermans__	bad news. i think dist-upgrade is doing exactly what you advised me against- installing 2.6.20-16
2007-06-08T10:26:00.000Z	khermans__	DrStrangeLov	well you can boot any kernel you like
2007-06-08T10:26:00.000Z	DrStrangeLov	khermans__	yeah- i tried doing that just now- using 2.6.20-12
