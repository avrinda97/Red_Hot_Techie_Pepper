2007-03-05T08:59:00.000Z	TeePOG		can someone please explain to me why all the ubuntu networking config files and documentation refer to a command called "iface" when it's not available on my system?
2007-03-05T08:59:00.000Z	kelsin	TeePOG	can you link to the documentation that does that?
2007-03-05T09:00:00.000Z	TeePOG	kelsin	my edgy files /etc/network/interfaces also have that exact command in
2007-03-05T09:03:00.000Z	kelsin	TeePOG	is the proper driver for you're ethernet card loaded?
2007-03-05T09:04:00.000Z	TeePOG	kelsin	it is, and it shows in a modprobe ... it was cloned from an identical machine, on which it does work
2007-03-05T09:04:00.000Z	kelsin	TeePOG	are you running those commands with "sudo" in front to be root?
2007-03-05T09:05:00.000Z	kelsin	TeePOG	and do you get errors when running "sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart" or just "start"?
2007-03-05T09:07:00.000Z	kelsin	TeePOG	pasted where?
2007-03-05T09:08:00.000Z	TeePOG	kelsin	in chan just now ... SIOCSIFADDR: No such device
2007-03-05T09:08:00.000Z	kelsin	TeePOG	oh ok, and that's the only error? What type of card is it and what driver are you using?
2007-03-05T09:08:00.000Z	kelsin	TeePOG	can you pastebin the result from "sudo lspci" as well?
2007-03-05T09:09:00.000Z	TeePOG	kelsin	it's an onboard Intel pro card ... kernel driver e100
2007-03-05T09:09:00.000Z	kelsin	TeePOG	when you say you cloned the driver from another machine, what do you mean? You ghosted the whole hard drive, or just copied the driver, or what?
2007-03-05T09:10:00.000Z	TeePOG	kelsin	i ghosted the whole hard drive using g4u
2007-03-05T09:10:00.000Z	kelsin	TeePOG	and the ethernet card is the same?
2007-03-05T09:11:00.000Z	kelsin	TeePOG	does it show up at all in "sudo ifconfig"?
2007-03-05T09:13:00.000Z	TeePOG	kelsin	it shows up when I do ifconfig -a
2007-03-05T09:15:00.000Z	kelsin	TeePOG	ok, can you pastebin the full result of "sudo ifconfig -a" and what happens when you "sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart" and "sudo cat /etc/network/interfaces"
2007-03-05T09:20:00.000Z	kelsin	TeePOG	did you pastebin that stuff? If so give me the url to check it out
