2010-10-28T16:24:00.000Z	gaelfx		ok, I seriously can't access adobe.com, can anyone tell me what the latest adobe flash player for 64-bit is?
2010-10-28T16:24:00.000Z	iceroot	gaelfx	the one in the repos
2010-10-28T16:25:00.000Z	iceroot	gaelfx	no need for adobe.com
2011-08-27T14:32:00.000Z	iceroot	gaelfx	normal ubuntu needs 4.4 gb
2011-08-27T14:34:00.000Z	gaelfx	iceroot	ok
2011-08-27T14:36:00.000Z	gaelfx	iceroot	tell that to the folks at Tesla Motors
2012-05-04T16:08:00.000Z	gaelfx	iceroot	he's trying to clone an install using rsync
2012-05-04T16:08:00.000Z	gaelfx	iceroot	and he wants to do this 30 or so more times after this
2012-05-04T16:09:00.000Z	iceroot	gaelfx	if i am correct his issue is "after cloning the uuid is not the same to the system will not start"
2012-05-04T16:09:00.000Z	iceroot	gaelfx	fix = blkid and edit /etc/fstab
2012-05-04T16:10:00.000Z	gaelfx	iceroot	fair enough
2012-06-28T14:12:00.000Z	iceroot	gaelfx	your hdd will be the bootleneck
2012-06-28T14:13:00.000Z	iceroot	gaelfx	1gbit/s is maybe the maximum a normal hdd can offer
2012-06-28T14:14:00.000Z	iceroot	gaelfx	then you also have rj45 and not wifi
2012-07-06T14:08:00.000Z	iceroot	gaelfx	because its confusing users how to set the size of / and /home
2012-07-06T14:08:00.000Z	gaelfx	iceroot	right, which is why the default install should do that for them, no?
2012-07-06T14:31:00.000Z	iceroot	gaelfx	and what is a good default for / and /home?
2012-07-06T14:31:00.000Z	iceroot	gaelfx	as you see there is no good default and you are always wasting space
2012-07-06T14:33:00.000Z	gaelfx	iceroot	yeah, but I don't think hard drive space is an issue for most people nowadays, wasting a few GB to keep a separate /home and stop people from losing their data when they bonk something up, seems like a good compromise to me
