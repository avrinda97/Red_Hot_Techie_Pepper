2008-10-19T20:23:00.000Z	Scurz_	ActionParsnip	what do you mwan by "id stick" ?
2008-10-19T20:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Scurz_	if you can do it in terminal, do it there. No need for an extra app cluttering the place up
2008-10-19T20:24:00.000Z	Scurz_	ActionParsnip	I just want to use a graphic software for managagin the wifi...
2008-10-19T20:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Scurz_	theres wifi-radar you could try
2008-10-19T20:25:00.000Z	Scurz_	ActionParsnip	wifi-radar has bugs on the laptop
2008-10-19T20:25:00.000Z	Scurz_	ActionParsnip	so I can't use it
2008-10-19T20:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Scurz_	maybe the app you are using now had bugs too
2008-10-19T20:26:00.000Z	Scurz_	ActionParsnip	so, do you know another soft?
2008-10-19T20:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Scurz_	i just edit /etc/network/interfaces to get it connected. GUI apps suck
2008-10-19T20:27:00.000Z	Scurz_	ActionParsnip	non
2008-10-19T20:28:00.000Z	Scurz_	ActionParsnip	and if I want to be connected to another wifi network??
2008-10-19T20:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Scurz_	then id have a multitude od interface files to copy in. I have desktop pcs which dont move
2008-10-19T20:29:00.000Z	Scurz_	ActionParsnip	I use a laptop...
2008-10-19T20:30:00.000Z	Scurz_	ActionParsnip	and I prefer to have a soft which scans all wifi networks
2008-10-19T20:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Scurz_	you can have a few interface files approriately named that you can have ready to rename to the main file. I have an EEEPC setup like this. I have scripts in /usr/bin to rename them across then restart my networking
2008-10-19T20:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Scurz_	im not the guy to ask, sorry
2008-10-19T20:30:00.000Z	Scurz_	ActionParsnip	ok...
