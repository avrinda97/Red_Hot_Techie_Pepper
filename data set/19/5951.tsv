2008-10-31T05:04:00.000Z	kneeki		Has anyone else come across the (initramfs) prompt while attempting to boot off the v8.10 CD? I'm having troubles getting past that point
2008-10-31T05:06:00.000Z	jtisme	kneeki	what initramfs problem are you experiencing
2008-10-31T05:07:00.000Z	kneeki	jtisme	No idea. When I attempt to boot off the 8.10 CD it eventually takes me to an (initramfs) prompt, and sits there. If I do 'exit' it will spit out a kernel panic
2008-10-31T05:08:00.000Z	jtisme	kneeki	i just downloaded the latest live cd let me see if i have any problems at boot
2008-10-31T05:09:00.000Z	jtisme	kneeki	before you burned the iso file did you check the MD5 sums?
2008-10-31T05:09:00.000Z	kneeki	jtisme	No =\
2008-10-31T05:09:00.000Z	kneeki	jtisme	I'll just download it again =)
2008-10-31T05:11:00.000Z	jtisme	kneeki	no just do the md5 check first
2008-10-31T05:11:00.000Z	kneeki	jtisme	Can't. The ISO image is at work. I'm at home now =p
2008-10-31T05:11:00.000Z	jtisme	kneeki	OH
2008-10-31T05:12:00.000Z	jtisme	kneeki	the download path is jammed i have 3 level hs dsl and took over 2 hours
2008-10-31T05:12:00.000Z	kneeki	jtisme	Ack
2008-10-31T05:12:00.000Z	kneeki	jtisme	Wonder if I could find a torrent
2008-10-31T05:15:00.000Z	jtisme	kneeki	no problems here with initramfs booting from live cd
2008-10-31T05:16:00.000Z	kneeki	jtisme	Mhmm, my wife's PC just did the CD check, worked fine
2008-10-31T05:16:00.000Z	kneeki	jtisme	Download is going fast though, so no worries. =)
2008-10-31T05:17:00.000Z	jtisme	kneeki	good perhaps you will have no more problems
2008-10-31T05:17:00.000Z	kneeki	jtisme	Hope so =)
2008-10-31T05:18:00.000Z	kneeki	jtisme	Wife's PC just booted off the CD fine. My PC is just the suck.
