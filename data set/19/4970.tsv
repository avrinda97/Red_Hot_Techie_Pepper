2008-10-12T13:54:00.000Z	lorenzosu	outbackwifi	I wasn't being impatient. Sorry if I gave that impression. Just wanted to make sure my call was recorded, and I appreciate people's effort on this channel.
2008-10-12T13:54:00.000Z	outbackwifi	lorenzosu	you're welcome
2008-10-12T14:02:00.000Z	outbackwifi	lorenzosu	system->preferences->keyring and remove the key for your network
2008-10-12T14:03:00.000Z	lorenzosu	outbackwifi	What exactly do you mean with "remove the key for your network"
2008-10-12T14:04:00.000Z	outbackwifi	lorenzosu	i mean remove the entry that the keyring made for holding your wep/wpa key
2008-10-12T14:04:00.000Z	lorenzosu	outbackwifi	The only entry I see is "login" under the "Password Keyrings" tab
2008-10-12T14:05:00.000Z	outbackwifi	lorenzosu	then you have not identified your problem correctly
2008-10-12T14:08:00.000Z	lorenzosu	outbackwifi	I'm sorry. I'll try to reexplain. I have auto-log-on for my own (only) account. As I access the desktop I get a keyring password prompt from the network manager before it will connect to a (WPA) home wifi network. Upon input of the password (same as log-in and sudo password) the network manager correctly connects to the wifi. I would like to avoid the password prompt.
2008-10-12T14:08:00.000Z	outbackwifi	lorenzosu	that happens because the keyring is asking permission from you to open the keyring to fetch the WPA key
2008-10-12T14:09:00.000Z	lorenzosu	outbackwifi	Can the permission asking be skipped/automatized?
2008-10-12T14:10:00.000Z	outbackwifi	lorenzosu	sure, i dont get asked
2008-10-12T14:11:00.000Z	lorenzosu	outbackwifi	Do you know how to achieve it?
2008-10-12T14:12:00.000Z	outbackwifi	lorenzosu	my wpa passphrases are stored in network manager and not the keyring (this was the default with 7.04 not 8.04)
2008-10-12T14:13:00.000Z	lorenzosu	outbackwifi	In fact this behavior started with upgrade to 8.04
2008-10-12T14:13:00.000Z	outbackwifi	lorenzosu	when you right click on nm and go to edit wireless networks, do you see your home network there?
2008-10-12T14:14:00.000Z	outbackwifi	lorenzosu	there is an option that says always allow access to keyring, select that and you should be done
2008-10-12T14:26:00.000Z	lorenzosu	outbackwifi	Ok will check that out. Gtg thanks for the support.
