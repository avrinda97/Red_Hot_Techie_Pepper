2009-01-24T12:16:00.000Z	mattg		just a quick question, i've installed ubuntu 8.10 on a windows laptop using the program, wubi. i was able to create a user account for myself and install updates, etc. however, i installed ubuntu to an 8gig usb flash drive using unetbootin, with this version, i can start and get into the OS but any changes i make (new user, adding software, etc) don't save when i shut down the computer or restart (which takes quite a bit of time),
2009-01-24T12:17:00.000Z	Gnea	mattg	you cut off at: (which takes quite a bit of time),
2009-01-24T12:18:00.000Z	mattg	Gnea	any ideas or a place to read up on the issue. sorry, completely new to this.
2009-01-24T12:19:00.000Z	Gnea	mattg	is your question in regards to the wubi installation or the usb installation? i'm thinking it's the usb, but the distinction wasn't obvious..
2009-01-24T12:19:00.000Z	mattg	Gnea	yes, the usb version.
2009-01-24T12:20:00.000Z	mattg	Gnea	the changes that i make aren't persisitant, they reset back to the basic settings when i restart or shut down
2009-01-24T12:21:00.000Z	Gnea	mattg	does the usb drive have some sort of switch to make it read-only? also, what filesystem is it formatted to?
2009-01-24T12:22:00.000Z	mattg	Gnea	it doesn't have a read only switch, it's formatted to FAT32.
2009-01-24T12:23:00.000Z	Gnea	mattg	okay. ubuntu doesn't work right on fat32 - it's impossible to change permissions, so everything is read-only.
2009-01-24T12:23:00.000Z	Gnea	mattg	it would have to be ext2 or ext3
2009-01-24T12:24:00.000Z	mattg	Gnea	can I format to the correct format using vista?
2009-01-24T12:25:00.000Z	Gnea	mattg	check out that second URL that I had ubottu give you
2009-01-24T12:25:00.000Z	mattg	Gnea	yea I'm reading that right now, thanks!
2009-01-24T12:29:00.000Z	mattg	Gnea	the link says that i should set aside a partition of 750mb for the install of ubuntu and then the rest of the drive format as fat32, is 750mb enough?
2009-01-24T12:31:00.000Z	Gnea	mattg	it's up to you - i'd probably use the whole thing
2009-01-24T12:32:00.000Z	mattg	Gnea	so format the whole drive as FAT16, can i then use the 'unetbootin' program to install it to the usb drive, that program made it very easy?
2009-01-24T12:33:00.000Z	Gnea	mattg	what method are you using?
2009-01-24T12:34:00.000Z	mattg	Gnea	method to do what?
2009-01-24T12:34:00.000Z	Gnea	mattg	...you did read the website, didn't you? you said you did...
