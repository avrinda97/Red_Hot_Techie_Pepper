2011-09-28T21:09:00.000Z	easylancer		How can I find out what is the default version of python on ubuntu 10?
2011-09-28T21:09:00.000Z	SIFTU	easylancer	python -V
2011-09-28T21:10:00.000Z	easylancer	SIFTU	I accidentally installed another version of python and the original seem to be corrupted, is there a way to rollback?
2011-09-28T21:11:00.000Z	easylancer		I was trying to install MySQL-python and it seemed to install a version of python with it
2011-09-28T21:11:00.000Z	SIFTU	easylancer	what version are you running?
2011-09-28T21:11:00.000Z	easylancer		commands like easy_install and pip which were working before are now missing
2011-09-28T21:12:00.000Z	easylancer	SIFTU	python 2.7.1+
2011-09-28T21:12:00.000Z	SIFTU	easylancer	nothin wrong with that version.. what version do you need
2011-09-28T21:13:00.000Z	easylancer	SIFTU	I just need easy_install working again really
2011-09-28T21:14:00.000Z	easylancer	SIFTU	how do I change the default version of python also, I am sure the version that came with Ubuntu 10 was python 2.6
2011-09-28T21:14:00.000Z	easylancer		I would like to revert back to that
2011-09-28T21:14:00.000Z	SIFTU	easylancer	hard to tell without more specifics, but python looks fine if you are running 2.7, maybe you need to install some modules
2011-09-28T21:15:00.000Z	SIFTU	easylancer	do you have python2.6 in /usr/bin
2011-09-28T21:15:00.000Z	easylancer	SIFTU	yes I do
2011-09-28T21:17:00.000Z	SIFTU	easylancer	and ls -la /usr/bin/python is a sym link to pythion2.7
2011-09-28T21:17:00.000Z	SIFTU	easylancer	?
2011-09-28T21:17:00.000Z	easylancer	SIFTU	yes thats correct
2011-09-28T21:17:00.000Z	SIFTU	easylancer	so you can just change that symlink
2011-09-28T21:17:00.000Z	easylancer	SIFTU	I will try that
