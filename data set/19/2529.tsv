2011-09-10T01:32:00.000Z	ikonia		guys, stop putting two words on a line and pressing enter, the problem will go away
2011-09-10T01:33:00.000Z	thunsucker	ikonia	sorry couldn't resist
2011-09-10T02:13:00.000Z	ikonia	thunsucker	why will that fix anything ?
2011-09-10T02:14:00.000Z	thunsucker	ikonia	if the host record is messed up for some reason yes
2011-09-10T02:15:00.000Z	ikonia	thunsucker	why would the host record be messed up, he's just said the issue
2011-09-10T02:15:00.000Z	ikonia	thunsucker	the error isn't an incorrect host one,
2011-09-10T02:15:00.000Z	thunsucker	ikonia	he said he couldn't ssh, in doing troubleshooting it's possible that he messed it up
2011-09-10T02:15:00.000Z	ikonia	thunsucker	randomly removing files isn't trouble shooting
2011-09-10T02:16:00.000Z	thunsucker	ikonia	thinking you know everything doesn't make you smart
2011-09-10T02:16:00.000Z	ikonia	thunsucker	I'm not silly enough to start randomly removing files
2011-09-10T02:16:00.000Z	thunsucker	ikonia	think about it, he imported the key incorrectly and could have messed up his ssh host record, it won't hurt anything if he removes it
2011-09-10T02:17:00.000Z	ikonia	thunsucker	importing the key doesn't touch known_hosts
2011-09-10T02:17:00.000Z	thunsucker	ikonia	also this is an open chat room, people are allow to post suggestions
2011-09-10T02:17:00.000Z	ikonia	thunsucker	yes, and I'm just informing you that randomly removing that file is not useful
2011-09-10T02:17:00.000Z	thunsucker	ikonia	randomly removing of a file is not what i suggested, i offered something that might help, whether you think it will or not
2011-09-10T02:18:00.000Z	ikonia	thunsucker	so I asked "how would removing the known hosts file help"
2011-09-10T02:18:00.000Z	thunsucker	ikonia	and i answered, learn to read, learn respect, and then logoff
2011-09-10T02:19:00.000Z	ikonia	thunsucker	drop teh attitude, if you can't help people properly, don't, randomly removing files with no reason is not helpful
2011-09-10T02:19:00.000Z	ikonia	thunsucker	when you are offering help that can cause problems, - it is
