2008-10-08T17:18:00.000Z	mib_b4blih		When I connect to an IP as: ssh <IP> how do I know if that is connecting to an internal network address or an IP in the internet?
2008-10-08T17:19:00.000Z	LjL	mib_b4blih	you don't, you need to know what your internal network's IPs look like
2008-10-08T17:21:00.000Z	LjL	mib_b4blih	unless your network is configured in an insane way, no (ikonia, i assure you that a network can be ;)
2008-10-08T17:26:00.000Z	LjL	mib_b4blih	it can't
2008-10-08T17:26:00.000Z	LjL	mib_b4blih	that's why hosts in an internal network should NOT have IPs that are assigned to public use
2008-10-08T17:27:00.000Z	LjL	mib_b4blih	examples of IPs assigned to *private* uses are 10.x.x.x and 192.168.x.x (iirc)
2008-10-08T17:27:00.000Z	mib_b4blih	LjL	Oh. I didnt know these things were standardised. We have it like that here.
2008-10-08T17:28:00.000Z	LjL	mib_b4blih	of course the IP addressing space is standardized, if it weren't you wouldn't have an internet
2008-10-08T17:28:00.000Z	mib_b4blih	LjL	Evidently, I'm a newbie :D
2008-10-08T17:29:00.000Z	mib_b4blih	LjL	Thanks for your time!
2008-10-08T17:31:00.000Z	LjL	mib_b4blih	it protects you from people who somehow gain physical access to your computer (or access to your files, anyway) from getting your private key with ease
2008-10-08T17:32:00.000Z	LjL	mib_b4blih	if you want to be able to ssh, just type "ssh <IP>" as we've been saying all along
2008-10-08T17:33:00.000Z	LjL	mib_b4blih	no, but it's necessary if you want to satisfactorily answer the questions you asked about internal and public IPs
2008-10-08T17:34:00.000Z	mib_b4blih	LjL	ok..
2008-10-08T17:35:00.000Z	LjL	mib_b4blih	yes, as well as people who somehow gain access to your files in /home, as i said
2008-10-08T17:36:00.000Z	mib_b4blih	LjL	But I can easily cat id_rsa and read the contents!
2008-10-08T17:36:00.000Z	LjL	mib_b4blih	noticed how it says "Proc-Type: 4,ENCRYPTED" at the start of that file?
2008-10-08T17:38:00.000Z	mib_b4blih	LjL	Oh!! I'm really asking dumb questions. Sorry!
