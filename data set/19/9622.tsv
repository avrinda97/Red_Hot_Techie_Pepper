2007-03-16T11:44:00.000Z	gordonjcp	faceface	is it a built-in card?
2007-03-16T11:45:00.000Z	gordonjcp	faceface	was it working in a different flavour of Linux?
2007-03-16T11:46:00.000Z	faceface	gordonjcp	actually no... it was working on ununtu as I said.. but dualboot xp it isn't working either... hem... lemmy double check that...
2007-03-16T11:46:00.000Z	gordonjcp	faceface	ok, if it's not working in Windows *either* and the proper drivers are installed, I'd consider the possibility that it's just plain not working
2007-03-16T11:46:00.000Z	faceface	gordonjcp	yeah
2007-03-16T11:47:00.000Z	gordonjcp	faceface	you haven't got a "flight switch" have you?
2007-03-16T11:47:00.000Z	faceface	gordonjcp	don't think so ... what is that?
2007-03-16T11:47:00.000Z	gordonjcp	faceface	a little switch somewhere to turn off wireless and bluetooth for when you're on a plane
2007-03-16T11:48:00.000Z	faceface	gordonjcp	yup, but its glowing blue for 'on'
2007-03-16T11:48:00.000Z	gordonjcp	faceface	guess how I know about that one?
2007-03-16T11:48:00.000Z	faceface	gordonjcp	er... cos you hijacked my webcam?
2007-03-16T11:49:00.000Z	faceface	gordonjcp	thing is, wlist eth1 scanning works fine
2007-03-16T11:53:00.000Z	gordonjcp	faceface	no, I meant "guess how I know about flight switches when diagnosing weird loss of wifi?"
2007-03-16T11:53:00.000Z	faceface	gordonjcp	because you have one and it was off and you were "like what"?
2007-03-16T11:54:00.000Z	faceface	gordonjcp	now XP is saying 'wtf is wireless?'
2007-03-16T11:55:00.000Z	gordonjcp	faceface	hrm, I don't know, I've never used XP
2007-03-16T11:55:00.000Z	faceface	gordonjcp	lucky you... but what is the scoop on the switch
2007-03-16T11:55:00.000Z	gordonjcp	faceface	maybe the card doesn't work, or XP has somehow lost its driver?
2007-03-16T11:55:00.000Z	faceface	gordonjcp	driver is the thing I bet
