2005-02-09T15:14:00.000Z	farruinn		isn't firestarter already installed?
2005-02-09T15:15:00.000Z	farruinn		check applications>internet>firestarter
2005-02-09T15:16:00.000Z	farruinn		sounds it, I must have installed it here myself
2005-02-09T15:18:00.000Z	farruinn		or use synaptic if you prefer that
2005-02-09T15:19:00.000Z	farruinn		not to mention avoid breakage...
2005-02-09T15:21:00.000Z	farruinn		dpkg is really what makes ubuntu beautiful, apt is just a pretty face that gets all the attention :p
2005-02-09T08:46:00.000Z	farruinn		the file should be recreated
2005-02-09T08:48:00.000Z	farruinn		eh, that's too bad, beagle was sounding interesting, but I don't know if I want to be running *another* daemon
2005-02-09T08:50:00.000Z	Lathiat	farruinn	hwo else do you expect it to do its bookkeeping
2005-02-09T08:50:00.000Z	Lathiat	farruinn	rather
2005-05-06T11:06:00.000Z	Lathiat	farruinn	you sure? it didn't use to...
2005-05-06T11:08:00.000Z	farruinn	Lathiat	you're right, it doesn't require it
2005-05-06T12:13:00.000Z	farruinn	Lathiat	he already said powerpc
2005-05-06T12:13:00.000Z	Lathiat	farruinn	oh right
2005-05-06T12:16:00.000Z	farruinn	Lathiat	geez, lighten up man...
2005-05-06T12:26:00.000Z	farruinn	Lathiat	I don't see the point in discouraging people form using the development release. Open source *relies* on people using and testing development releases...
2005-05-06T12:27:00.000Z	Lathiat	farruinn	Because breezy is in a *very* broken state at the moment
2005-05-06T12:28:00.000Z	Lathiat	farruinn	Everyone is at conferences at the moment and hacking will not begin for another week
2005-05-06T12:28:00.000Z	Lathiat	farruinn	so even for me, a fairly experienced user, i am not running breezy because alot of stuf fis horribly broken and will be for at least the next week.
