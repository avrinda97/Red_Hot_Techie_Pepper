2006-08-27T12:29:00.000Z	OmegaNine		Anyone got an updated URL for a XGL install howto?
2006-08-27T12:30:00.000Z	Em3rald	OmegaNine	have you looked thru the ubuntuforums?  There is a good one there that I used a while ago.
2006-08-27T12:30:00.000Z	OmegaNine	Em3rald	 There are a few of them, thought maybe there was an offical chan one.
2006-08-27T12:31:00.000Z	Em3rald	OmegaNine	well, it depends on which video card you have.  Nvidia or ATI
2006-08-27T12:31:00.000Z	OmegaNine	Em3rald	ATI on a lappy
2006-08-27T12:31:00.000Z	Em3rald	OmegaNine	... hmm, well that would be a different one than the one I used.  If I remember correctly you have to use AIGLX.
2006-08-27T12:32:00.000Z	OmegaNine	Em3rald	Ill google around for it.  thanks
2006-08-27T12:32:00.000Z	Em3rald	OmegaNine	no problem.  I'll have a look to see if I find the one I saw before that people were raving about ...
2006-08-27T12:32:00.000Z	OmegaNine	Em3rald	Thanks, that would be great.
2006-08-27T12:35:00.000Z	Em3rald	OmegaNine	try this one:  http://www.compiz.net/viewtopic.php?id=389 ... it looks like the one that others had recommended.
2006-08-27T12:36:00.000Z	OmegaNine	Em3rald	I think is the one i was using...I kept getting errors saying there was a lib missing that I couldnt find.  But I will poke around more.  Thanks, been a big help
2006-08-27T12:36:00.000Z	Em3rald	OmegaNine	 no problem my friend :D  Good luck!
2006-08-27T12:40:00.000Z	Em3rald	OmegaNine	just for kicks, does aptitude install work better than apt-get?
2006-08-27T12:40:00.000Z	OmegaNine	Em3rald	One sec I will look
2006-08-27T12:41:00.000Z	OmegaNine	Em3rald	OK that just pisses me off....Installed fine
2006-08-27T12:42:00.000Z	Em3rald	OmegaNine	 Hahaha!  Well thats good anyway.  I think Aptitude handles dependencies better.  This is what Ayisu says in ubuntuforums
2006-08-27T12:43:00.000Z	OmegaNine	Em3rald	Never used it, will have to keep it in mind.  I have to shamfully admit I was a yum user till 2 months ago
2006-08-27T12:43:00.000Z	OmegaNine	Em3rald	Thanks big thoguh!
