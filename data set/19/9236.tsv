2007-02-24T13:16:00.000Z	edgy		Hi, for f in '*.ext'; do cat $f > $f-ext; how can I modify it to add -ext to the filename please?
2007-02-24T13:17:00.000Z	arrenlex	edgy	Are you trying to make your own 'cp' utility? xD
2007-02-24T13:17:00.000Z	edgy	arrenlex	actually not but I want to know how to use for loop effectively
2007-02-24T13:17:00.000Z	arrenlex	edgy	What are you trying to do?
2007-02-24T13:21:00.000Z	arrenlex	edgy	I still don't understand what you're trying to do. You have a file called foo.ext. What do you want it to end up as?
2007-02-24T13:22:00.000Z	edgy	arrenlex	I am trying actually to replace some text in many files using sed script and save the result in a new file with a new extension
2007-02-24T13:23:00.000Z	arrenlex	edgy	new extension is going to be hard. Stripping off the old extension is a total hack.
2007-02-24T13:23:00.000Z	arrenlex	edgy	Oh. If you're not removing the old one, that's easy.
2007-02-24T13:24:00.000Z	edgy	arrenlex	actually I want to append something to the filename not the extension
2007-02-24T13:25:00.000Z	arrenlex	edgy	for a in `ls *.ext` ; do sed 's/hello/bye/g' $a > ${a}-ext2 ; done
2007-02-24T13:25:00.000Z	arrenlex	edgy	Oh!
2007-02-24T13:25:00.000Z	arrenlex	edgy	Hm.
2007-02-24T13:25:00.000Z	arrenlex	edgy	Why don't you just use a renaming utility? It's so much easier.
2007-02-24T13:28:00.000Z	edgy	arrenlex	n2diy: ok the real example is: for f in *.css; do sudo sed -e 's/left/lleft/g' -e 's/right/left/g' -e 's/lleft/right/g' $f > $f-rtl.css
2007-02-24T13:33:00.000Z	arrenlex	edgy	here:
2007-02-24T13:34:00.000Z	arrenlex	edgy	But surely there's a better way to do that.
2007-02-24T13:36:00.000Z	arrenlex	edgy	Does it do what you want?
2007-02-24T13:37:00.000Z	arrenlex	edgy	Oh, if you're using sudo with sed, you're going to have to use | sudo tee "file" instead of > "file".
2007-02-24T13:38:00.000Z	arrenlex	edgy	And move the sudo to the tee, not the sed.
