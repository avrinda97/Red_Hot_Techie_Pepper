2006-01-15T15:31:00.000Z	ompaul	sophtpaw	 /ns help  and read the results
2006-01-15T15:41:00.000Z	ompaul	sophtpaw	/ns help is the start then you see set and you end up with >>/ns set password NEWPASSWORD<<
2006-01-15T15:42:00.000Z	sophtpaw	ompaul	ok, so how do i get into 'SET'?
2006-01-15T15:43:00.000Z	ompaul	sophtpaw	I gave you the command  how hard can it be maybe don't change it if you can't cope with it
2006-01-15T15:43:00.000Z	ompaul	sophtpaw	 >>/ns set password NEWPASSWORD<< where you choose what NEWPASSWORD is
2006-01-15T15:46:00.000Z	ompaul	sophtpaw	then you can't reset the password for irc
