2011-06-26T15:16:00.000Z	ghsh	sugoruyo	top
2011-06-26T15:16:00.000Z	ghsh	sugoruyo	yes
2011-06-26T15:16:00.000Z	sugoruyo	ghsh	can top do that for me?
2011-06-26T15:16:00.000Z	ghsh	sugoruyo	it can serve as a means yes
2011-06-26T15:17:00.000Z	sugoruyo	ghsh	but it can't do it on its own?
2011-06-26T15:17:00.000Z	ghsh	sugoruyo	man top -- a simple script
2011-06-26T15:17:00.000Z	ghsh	sugoruyo	it's a back end
2011-06-26T15:18:00.000Z	sugoruyo	ghsh	i know what top is but it doesn't provide me with min,max,avg
2011-06-26T15:18:00.000Z	ghsh	sugoruyo	 lol hence the script
2011-06-26T15:18:00.000Z	sugoruyo	ghsh	i know how to run it in intervals rather than interactive, how to make it monitor what pids i want it to
2011-06-26T15:19:00.000Z	sugoruyo	ghsh	i'm not familiar with scripting though...
2011-06-26T15:20:00.000Z	ghsh	sugoruyo	 well that would be the only way i could do it
2011-06-26T15:20:00.000Z	ghsh	sugoruyo	 i know no gui way sorry
2011-06-26T15:21:00.000Z	sugoruyo	ghsh	what you're talking about is basically running top in intervals and getting the info from its output, putting it through a script keeping the min and max and summing it so we can have an average at the end
2011-06-26T15:22:00.000Z	ghsh	sugoruyo	 yes
2011-06-26T15:22:00.000Z	sugoruyo	ghsh	i don't want no gui method, it's gonna be run over ssh on ubuntu server headless machines
2011-06-26T15:23:00.000Z	sugoruyo	ghsh	the part i'm unfamiliar with is the bash scripting, specifically which commands i could use (and how) to "parse" the output from top
2011-06-26T15:23:00.000Z	ghsh	sugoruyo	 then there you go
2011-06-26T15:23:00.000Z	ghsh	sugoruyo	man bash sed bc touch mkdir etc
