2007-09-24T15:39:00.000Z	GBenemy		How do I uninstall Ubuntu? I tried booting with the live cd, then using gparted to just delete the partition. but then my computer would't boot :( it just said "Grub Loading Failed" and then switched off :(
2007-09-24T15:39:00.000Z	h1st0	GBenemy	you need to re write the mbr
2007-09-24T15:39:00.000Z	h1st0	GBenemy	what are you trying to install?
2007-09-24T15:39:00.000Z	GBenemy	h1st0	what's that?
2007-09-24T15:40:00.000Z	h1st0	GBenemy	is there any other operating system on the drive?
2007-09-24T15:41:00.000Z	h1st0	GBenemy	Is there any other OS on the drive like Windows or something?
2007-09-24T15:43:00.000Z	GBenemy	h1st0	so how do I do it?
2007-09-24T15:45:00.000Z	h1st0	GBenemy	Were you dual booting between windows and ubuntu?
2007-09-24T15:46:00.000Z	GBenemy	h1st0	i have both installed, but i really can't figure out how to use ubuntu, and i can't install anything or anything, and as an experienced windows user, i'd prefer to stick with that. I still want ubuntu, but I want ubuntu, just on a diff hdd, because it's taking up too much on this one
2007-09-24T15:47:00.000Z	h1st0	GBenemy	then boot to the windows cd and select recovery.  When youg get to the C: just type in fixmbr
2007-09-24T15:48:00.000Z	h1st0	GBenemy	No you have to use the fixmbr command
2007-09-24T15:49:00.000Z	GBenemy	h1st0	'fixmbr' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.
2007-09-24T15:49:00.000Z	h1st0	GBenemy	what version of windows?
2007-09-24T15:49:00.000Z	GBenemy	h1st0	vista
2007-09-24T15:50:00.000Z	h1st0	GBenemy	well it should be on the installation cd somewhere.  Navigate to it and just fixmbr C:  will solve all your problems.  Getting rid of grub.
2007-09-24T15:50:00.000Z	h1st0	GBenemy	You may want to ask in #windows
2007-09-24T15:50:00.000Z	GBenemy	h1st0	I don't have a cd
2007-09-24T15:51:00.000Z	h1st0	GBenemy	You need to ask in #windows they will know the location of fixmbr on the vista cd.
