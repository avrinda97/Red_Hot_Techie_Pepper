2009-12-25T22:07:00.000Z	Bias112		hello
2009-12-25T22:07:00.000Z	Bias112		I just intalled Mythbuntu
2009-12-25T22:07:00.000Z	Bias112		it went to 100% testing hardware and so
2009-12-25T22:08:00.000Z	Bias112		just when it went to 100% the computer restarted
2009-12-25T22:08:00.000Z	Bias112		and then ofc I got 2 boot options, Xp or Mythbuntu
2009-12-25T22:09:00.000Z	Bias112		but in grub there was only xp, 2 strange nt 2000 and one vista loader
2009-12-25T22:09:00.000Z	Bias112		and I couldnt enter anyone of them... im wondering how I can boot into mythbuntu
2009-12-25T22:09:00.000Z	morissette	Bias112	did you check menu.lst?
2009-12-25T22:10:00.000Z	morissette	Bias112	I believe by default is at /boot/grub
2009-12-25T22:10:00.000Z	Bias112	morissette	grub folder is empty
2009-12-25T22:10:00.000Z	morissette	Bias112	`locate menu.lst`
2009-12-25T22:11:00.000Z	morissette	Bias112	So you are locked out of Mythbuntu? Try installing FS-Drive
2009-12-25T22:12:00.000Z	Bias112	morissette	what do if there is no files in \grub?
2009-12-25T22:12:00.000Z	morissette	Bias112	 im w/ adalal try installing grub from a live cd
2009-12-25T22:13:00.000Z	morissette	Bias112	so grub is currently the default bootloader/
2009-12-25T22:13:00.000Z	morissette	Bias112	are you familiar w/ grub cli?
2009-12-25T22:14:00.000Z	morissette	Bias112	file structure is basic unix
2009-12-25T22:15:00.000Z	morissette	Bias112	you just need to reinstall grub loader
