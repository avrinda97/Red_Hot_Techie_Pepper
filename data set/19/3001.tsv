2009-11-09T00:38:00.000Z	Tartaros	Gabs	so there you go. even 16GB cards or bigger are really cheap, so you can install ubuntu on it. That's how I have it (right now :)
2009-11-09T00:39:00.000Z	Gabs	Tartaros	yeah but I got an 8GB USB drive ... I installed that way before but not working this time

2009-11-09T00:41:00.000Z	Gabs	Tartaros	when I try to boot to USB I just get a blank screen with flashing cursor (no error)
2009-11-09T00:41:00.000Z	Tartaros	Gabs	and how did you create the usb thingy?
2009-11-09T00:42:00.000Z	Gabs	Tartaros	with unetbootin
2009-11-09T00:42:00.000Z	Gabs	Tartaros	I tried with the usb-creator on the ISO but that wasn't working at all
2009-11-09T00:43:00.000Z	Tartaros	Gabs	well that's weird, it worked for me so I dunno...
