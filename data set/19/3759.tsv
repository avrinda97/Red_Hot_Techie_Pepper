2009-06-12T08:24:00.000Z	texasjack	cabrey	yep... 59% of 512 MB...
2009-06-14T06:11:00.000Z	cabrey	texasjack	go to #ubuntu-server and most will say yes
2009-06-14T06:12:00.000Z	texasjack	cabrey	thanks.  I have some doubts about UTF-8 support in shell and apps...  Not so lucky about this.  Yesterday I'm freaked out.
2009-06-14T06:15:00.000Z	texasjack	cabrey	and how can I setup the resolution at console?  I tried vga=318 and vga=o, but neither works...
2009-06-14T06:15:00.000Z	cabrey	texasjack	what is your resolution?
2009-06-14T06:16:00.000Z	texasjack	cabrey	I can choose among various, but I'm trying to put at 1024x768x32.
2009-06-14T06:16:00.000Z	cabrey	texasjack	you need to put that on the kernel argument line
2009-06-14T06:17:00.000Z	texasjack	cabrey	I putted...  But they always tells me that was an invalid resolution...
2009-06-14T06:18:00.000Z	cabrey	texasjack	hold on, why do you need a high res frame buffer?
2009-06-14T06:18:00.000Z	texasjack	cabrey	only with « ask=vga », and then choosing among the resolutions to make it work.
2009-06-14T06:19:00.000Z	texasjack	cabrey	I was making some tests with UTF-8 at console.  But they all failed.  I'm using 'TerminusBold' font @ 20x10...
2009-06-14T06:21:00.000Z	texasjack	cabrey	and to use console, in my opinion, jut in those resolutions; to see, for example, images, .pdfs, and stuffs like that.
2009-06-14T06:22:00.000Z	texasjack	cabrey	I like the console a lot, but I'm stuck with the UTF-8 compliant stuffs...
2009-06-14T06:24:00.000Z	texasjack	cabrey	they're all mute...
2009-06-14T06:29:00.000Z	texasjack	cabrey	if I could write those chars on my console... God, please, take me to heaven, and my done here... Until then...  Living on...
