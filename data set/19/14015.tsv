2006-04-15T07:22:00.000Z	freakabcd	Amaranth	john fettig has already confirmed the bug kill with that patch on dapper. and i can confirm the same bug kill on dapper
2006-04-15T07:23:00.000Z	Amaranth	freakabcd	i'm pinging the maintainer
2006-04-15T07:23:00.000Z	freakabcd	Amaranth	i think this bug fix is quite critical because during some commit or something dualhead stopped working! and it wasn;t noticed for a very long time
2006-04-15T07:25:00.000Z	freakabcd	Amaranth	strangely enough i'm sure dualhead worked in hoary! :) because of the absence of the bug (or whatever caused it to appear)
2006-04-15T07:32:00.000Z	freakabcd	Amaranth	you still around?
2006-04-15T07:33:00.000Z	freakabcd	Amaranth	thanks for taking the issue to the maintainer. i hope that 3 line patch makes into dapper final
2006-04-16T12:31:00.000Z	freakabcd	Amaranth	you around?
