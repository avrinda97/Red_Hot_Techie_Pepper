2007-03-01T15:45:00.000Z	cables	BENN92647	did you actually install flash after enabling backports? If it's already installed, go to update manager.
2007-03-01T15:45:00.000Z	cables	BENN92647	it's flashplugin-nonfree actually
2007-03-01T15:46:00.000Z	cables	BENN92647	are you trying to install Adobe flash, or this gpl flash thing?
2007-03-01T15:53:00.000Z	cables	BENN92647	not at all... wine is wine.
2007-03-01T15:53:00.000Z	cables	BENN92647	if you want wine, do "sudo aptitude install wine"
2007-03-01T15:53:00.000Z	cables	BENN92647	not wine.
2007-03-01T16:00:00.000Z	cables	BENN92647	run command "wine windowsprogram.exe"
2007-03-01T16:02:00.000Z	cables	BENN92647	run command "wine windowsprog.exe"
2007-03-01T16:02:00.000Z	cables	BENN92647	replace windowsprog.exe with whatever exe you're using
