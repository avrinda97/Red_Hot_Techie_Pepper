2010-03-22T15:14:00.000Z	ddavids		pls wht is the differenc btw auto lo: iface lo inet loopback and auto eth0: iface eth0 inet dhcp?
2010-03-22T15:15:00.000Z	Peanut	ddavids	the lo interface is your loopback interface (127.0.0.1), the other entry specifies that your eth0 network interface will get its IP address via DHCP.
2010-03-22T15:16:00.000Z	ddavids		im finding it difficult to connect to an internet modem today...but i have used same in the past on my karmic desktop system...
2010-03-22T15:17:00.000Z	Peanut	ddavids	could you give a more detailed problem description than "I find it difficult to connect today"? :-)
2010-03-22T15:17:00.000Z	ddavids	Peanut	thanks, does that mean my modem wont connect cos it doesnt have similar values to the 127.0.0.1 interface?
2010-03-22T15:17:00.000Z	Peanut	ddavids	no, this looks perfectly correct - that file is probably not the cause of your problems, especially if you didn't change anything in it.
2010-03-22T15:19:00.000Z	ddavids	Peanut	but i cant seem to connect this modem cos its interface is 77.245.65.xxx
2010-03-22T15:19:00.000Z	Peanut	ddavids	is that the address of your network interface, or the address of your modem? Does your modem even have an address? Do you want to 'connect to the modem', or only connect through the modem to the internet?
2010-03-22T15:19:00.000Z	ddavids	Peanut	i have been trying now but it just doenst connect...
2010-03-22T15:20:00.000Z	ddavids	Peanut	tht is the IP address when it does connect, i use it for my internet...
2010-03-22T15:22:00.000Z	ddavids	Peanut	i wld like to connect thru the modem to the internet...
2010-03-22T15:23:00.000Z	Peanut	ddavids	Ok, and does it currently not get an IP address anymore, where this used to work in the past?
2010-03-22T15:24:00.000Z	ddavids	Peanut	excatly
2010-03-22T15:24:00.000Z	ddavids		it doesnt get IP anymore and thus says disconnected..
2010-03-22T15:25:00.000Z	Peanut	ddavids	does it work if you use another computer or OS? Is the problem limited to Ubuntu?
2010-03-22T15:26:00.000Z	ddavids	Peanut	its the same probelm on windows too..
2010-03-22T15:26:00.000Z	Peanut	ddavids	then it is not an Ubuntu problem, but a problem with your modem or ISP. Please talk to your ISP about this, it is very unlikely that we in #ubuntu can help you with this.
2010-03-22T15:26:00.000Z	ddavids	Peanut	mosttimes, ubuntu is able to connect but wondows cant connect 98% of the time
2010-03-22T15:27:00.000Z	ddavids	Peanut	thanks
