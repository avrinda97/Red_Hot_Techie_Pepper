2005-08-09T12:55:00.000Z	cix		Hi I just installed Ubuntu on my laptop, but why do I not get asked to make a root pass?
2005-08-09T12:56:00.000Z	holycow	cix	there is none, everything on ubuntu is sudoed as necessary
2005-08-09T12:56:00.000Z	cix	holycow	and that means?
2005-08-09T12:57:00.000Z	holycow	cix	to invoke commands that require root priviledges you do sudo command -switch
2005-08-09T12:57:00.000Z	holycow	cix	theoretically it helps to prevent newbs from running as root, and limits exposure to the root priviledges i guess
2005-08-09T12:57:00.000Z	cix	holycow	hm ok, and I can't setup a root password anyway ?
2005-08-09T12:58:00.000Z	holycow	cix	you can set one up sure, but its not necessary
2005-08-09T13:00:00.000Z	holycow	cix	ubuntu on the desktop, debian on the servers
2005-08-09T13:01:00.000Z	holycow	cix	well because it's easy to use does not mean its not powerfull, it just means its properly engineered
2005-08-09T13:01:00.000Z	holycow	cix	however there is no faking and handholding, say like xandros that pretends to be windows but really isn't
2005-08-09T13:02:00.000Z	holycow	cix	do you run linux in any form on a box?
2005-08-09T13:04:00.000Z	cix	holycow	I just installed it on my laptop, and will finally delete MS maybe on may desktop if I can run my games with the same performance on linux as on ms
2005-08-09T13:04:00.000Z	holycow	cix	ah games, ehe, well you can run some using cedega but probably not all
2005-08-09T13:04:00.000Z	cix	holycow	yes I know, and the performance and fps isn't the same that really sucks :/
2005-08-09T13:04:00.000Z	holycow	cix	how do you like it so far? and why the switch if i may ask?
2005-08-09T13:05:00.000Z	holycow	cix	the performance is equal on games that are natively ported to linux, say doom3, but otherwise you are always taking a hit with something like cedega
2005-08-09T13:05:00.000Z	cix	holycow	it's free, and I'm tired of microsoft and their goddam money politic
2005-08-09T13:06:00.000Z	holycow	cix	interesting, well welcome, have fun :)
2005-08-09T13:06:00.000Z	holycow	cix	thats why i switched too actually
