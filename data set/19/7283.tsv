2007-09-15T11:10:00.000Z	Tex-Twil		How can I disable a password in Ubuntu ?
2007-09-15T11:10:00.000Z	Tex-Twil		of my account
2007-09-15T11:11:00.000Z	spdf	Tex-Twil	You can specify an automatic login for X
2007-09-15T11:11:00.000Z	Tex-Twil		where can I specify the automatic login ?
2007-09-15T11:12:00.000Z	spdf	Tex-Twil	There's a config app under the preferences menu, I don't have a desktop in front of me athe moment. Login something, there'll be some tabs for configuring the login screen's look and such
2007-09-15T11:13:00.000Z	spdf	Tex-Twil	Somewhere in there you'll find an automatic login, as well as a timed automatic login
2007-09-15T11:13:00.000Z	Tex-Twil		ok
2007-09-15T11:13:00.000Z	Tex-Twil		I ll find it
2007-09-15T11:13:00.000Z	Tex-Twil		but now: how can I disable a sudo su password ?
2007-09-15T11:14:00.000Z	Tex-Twil		ok
2007-09-15T11:14:00.000Z	spdf	Tex-Twil	for sudo, you'll just need to add a line to the sudo config using visudo
2007-09-15T11:15:00.000Z	Tex-Twil	spdf	NOPASSWD in sudoers ?
2007-09-15T11:17:00.000Z	spdf	Tex-Twil	Yah, to the %admin line
2007-09-15T11:17:00.000Z	spdf	Tex-Twil	%admin ALL=NOPASSWD ALL or something along those lines
2007-09-15T11:18:00.000Z	Tex-Twil		ok I ll give it a try
2007-09-15T11:18:00.000Z	Tex-Twil		thx spdf
2007-09-15T11:18:00.000Z	spdf	Tex-Twil	I believe there's a commented line near the top along those lines, and the %admin line is at the bottom
2007-09-15T11:21:00.000Z	spdf	Tex-Twil	Its probably a good idea to create a root password before mucking with the sudo config, considering that if you mess something up you won't be able to sudo :P
