2008-03-06T14:15:00.000Z	matthijs		it's like a real pipe
2008-03-06T14:15:00.000Z	matthijs		but there's a better command, called 'less'
2008-03-06T14:15:00.000Z	matthijs		less is not more :)
2008-03-06T14:16:00.000Z	matthijs		If you're getting in to sysadmin, appreciate the unix humor :)
2008-03-06T14:16:00.000Z	matthijs		well try and see.
2008-03-06T14:17:00.000Z	matthijs		You should really get a us one. or configure the us keymap and learn us blind
2008-03-06T14:17:00.000Z	matthijs		my pipe is on the middle row,next to enter
2008-03-06T14:17:00.000Z	matthijs		I have no clue what type of keyboard I have
2008-03-06T14:18:00.000Z	matthijs		ok giddion, is there a file in our rc3 dir, that says something with: ssh
2008-03-06T14:18:00.000Z	matthijs		you could do a 'ls *ssh*'
2008-03-06T14:19:00.000Z	Giddion	matthijs	no SSH
2008-03-06T14:21:00.000Z	Giddion	matthijs	ahh i think im in the wrong folder im in rc3.d
2008-03-06T14:22:00.000Z	matthijs	Giddion	type ls -lha
2008-03-06T14:22:00.000Z	Giddion	matthijs	ok
2008-03-06T14:32:00.000Z	Giddion	matthijs	it has an [OK]  but 2 lines say Warning Could not load key
2008-03-06T14:33:00.000Z	matthijs	Giddion	it complains about the key here too
2008-03-06T14:40:00.000Z	matthijs	Giddion	something like that yes, since you know basic system admin, you can figure that out.
2008-03-06T14:41:00.000Z	Giddion	matthijs	thanks so much for your help :P
2008-03-06T14:41:00.000Z	matthijs	Giddion	have fun
