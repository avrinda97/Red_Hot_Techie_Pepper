2007-04-09T15:35:00.000Z	trenton		damnit, ok, i can't play dvd's on here, i have all the multimedia codecs installed and have ran that install-css.sh thing. mplayer and totem refuses to play them...error for totem : Totem could not play 'dvd:///media/cdrom0'. for mplayer: Error opening/initializing the selected video_out (-vo) device. ....what do I need to do to get this to work?
2007-04-09T15:37:00.000Z	trenton		anybody?
2007-04-09T15:38:00.000Z	predaeus	trenton	did you try ogle?
2007-04-09T15:38:00.000Z	trenton	predaeus	is that yet another player?
2007-04-09T15:38:00.000Z	predaeus	trenton	yes for dvds
2007-04-09T15:39:00.000Z	trenton	predaeus	I'd rather just get mplayer and totem to work on it first...actually, i'd just like to get mplayer to work, and find out some way to uninstall totem (since I don't use it)
2007-04-09T15:40:00.000Z	predaeus	trenton	did you install libdvdcss2 I think I needed that to get dvds working
2007-04-09T15:42:00.000Z	predaeus	trenton	did you get the extra codecs?
2007-04-09T15:43:00.000Z	trenton	predaeus	yep, all the ones it listed in the desktop docs on ubuntu website
2007-04-09T15:43:00.000Z	predaeus	trenton	try running mplayer from a terminal like "mplayer -vo x11 -ao oss path_to_dvd"
2007-04-09T15:44:00.000Z	predaeus	trenton	you might need to change the -vo or -ao options for your system. It's the video out and audio out option. see "man mplayer" (quit with q). the video option reported the error in the message you posted first.
2007-04-09T15:45:00.000Z	trenton	predaeus	ahh i see, it says failed to load the win32 loadlibrary...hrm, lemme try installing the win32 codec too
2007-04-09T15:46:00.000Z	predaeus	trenton	ok
2007-04-09T15:58:00.000Z	trenton	predaeus	nope, so what do i need to do with the -vo option?
2007-04-09T16:02:00.000Z	predaeus	trenton	the "!" commands go to the channel's bot "ubotu" who can answer prepared questions   the > should send the answer to you as a private message. No need to change the -vo option if a video runs but it is just for display not for selecting the codec or sometning like that. I have no idea, probably still try Ogle since that was the only player I could get DVDs to run on. (probably the only one, I don't remember)
2007-04-09T16:02:00.000Z	predaeus	trenton	sorry I mixed messages
2007-04-09T16:10:00.000Z	trenton	predaeus	aha, it works fine in vlc ....
2007-04-09T16:11:00.000Z	trenton	predaeus	thanks for the help
2007-04-09T16:11:00.000Z	predaeus	trenton	fine, I like vlc best. But totally forgot about it with the dvd topic since ogle was the only one that worked then. *g* sorry. but good to hear.
