2009-01-28T17:23:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	paul68	I took a look at that, and it doesn't list any theming engine.  did you check in the package that you downloaded to see if it includes a theme engine of its own ?  many themes dow that
2009-01-28T17:24:00.000Z	paul68	Samus_Aran	how would I reconise such a file?
2009-01-28T17:27:00.000Z	paul68	Samus_Aran	the thing is that in Ooo I just have all the menu items listed such as save and don't have any icons there I think that it has something to do with the gtk theme engine but I am not sure
2009-01-28T17:28:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	paul68	which version of OpenOffice.org ?
2009-01-28T17:28:00.000Z	paul68	Samus_Aran	2.4
2009-01-28T17:29:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	paul68	could you upgrde to 3.0.0 and see if the issue still exists ?

2009-01-28T17:37:00.000Z	paul68	Samus_Aran	how do I do this upgrade to openoffice from the console?
2009-01-28T17:38:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	paul68	download the .tar.bz2 file from openoffice.org for .deb (32bit or 64bit).  extract the package: tar xvjf something.tar.bz2, then cd into the directory it creates, then: dpkg --install *deb */*deb
2009-01-28T17:38:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	paul68	but first make sure you uninstall OpenOffice.org 2.x, so there are no overlapping files
2009-01-28T17:39:00.000Z	paul68	Samus_Aran	ok
