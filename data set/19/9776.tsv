2006-09-19T09:02:00.000Z	cafuego	adc	We don't support redhat, sorry ;-)
2006-09-19T09:02:00.000Z	adc		hving issues with libsdl-dev
2006-09-19T09:02:00.000Z	cafuego	adc	Missing depends? Do you have any non-official repositories enabled?
2006-09-19T09:02:00.000Z	adc		libglu1-mesa-dev
2006-09-19T09:03:00.000Z	adc		  libglu1-mesa-dev: Depends: libglu1-mesa (= 6.4.1-0ubuntu8) but 6.5.1-cvs20060628 is to be installed
2006-09-19T09:03:00.000Z	cafuego	adc	Are you on edgy?
2006-09-19T09:03:00.000Z	adc		this is dapper
2006-09-19T09:04:00.000Z	adc		apt
2006-09-19T09:04:00.000Z	cafuego	adc	There is no 'libsdl-dev' in Dapper.
2006-09-19T09:04:00.000Z	adc		oops, libsdl1.2-dev
2006-09-19T09:05:00.000Z	cafuego	adc	The libglu1-mesa(-dev) packages here are both 6.5.1+cvs20060824. Are you package lists up to date?
2006-09-19T09:06:00.000Z	adc		yes
2006-09-19T09:07:00.000Z	adc		apt-get update right ?
2006-09-19T09:07:00.000Z	adc		hmmm i tried compiz awhile ago maybe there are leftovers from that. thnks for verifying it works for you. i'll let you know in a few
2006-09-19T09:12:00.000Z	adc		hmmm, 6.4.1-0ubuntu8 is the "latest version"
2006-09-19T09:14:00.000Z	adc	cafuego	apt-get update doesnt seem to be updating it
2006-09-19T09:15:00.000Z	cafuego	adc	Maybe your mirror is out of sync.
