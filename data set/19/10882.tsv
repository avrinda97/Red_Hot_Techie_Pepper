2008-02-12T07:32:00.000Z	Shaun2222		is there a command line tool for managing service to start on boot
2008-02-12T07:32:00.000Z	Shaun2222		other that update-rc.d looking for something a bit more user friendly for customers
2008-02-12T07:32:00.000Z	nickrud	Shaun2222	update-rc.d
2008-02-12T07:32:00.000Z	nickrud	Shaun2222	rcconf
2008-02-12T07:33:00.000Z	Shaun2222	nickrud	rcconf is in 7.10?
2008-02-12T07:33:00.000Z	nickrud	Shaun2222	yes
2008-02-12T07:34:00.000Z	nickrud	Shaun2222	rrconf is the package name
2008-02-12T07:34:00.000Z	nickrud	Shaun2222	erm, rcconf that is
2008-02-12T07:36:00.000Z	nickrud	Shaun2222	you need universe, do the above to set up things correctly
2008-02-12T07:37:00.000Z	Shaun2222	nickrud	is that thing telling me how to do it via a gui or somthing...
2008-02-12T07:37:00.000Z	nickrud	Shaun2222	yes.
2008-02-12T07:38:00.000Z	nickrud	Shaun2222	then look for the lines ending in universe, and uncomment them. Also, add the word multiverse there at the end of those lines
2008-02-12T07:38:00.000Z	nickrud	Shaun2222	a sec, I'll put up a complete set
2008-02-12T07:41:00.000Z	nickrud	Shaun2222	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/55666/  I'm using a local mirror, you can adapt them to us.archive if you like
2008-02-12T07:43:00.000Z	Shaun2222	nickrud	thats a huge ass list of sources
2008-02-12T07:43:00.000Z	nickrud	Shaun2222	they could be consolidated into about 6-8 lines, but this is how ubuntu releases them
2008-02-12T07:44:00.000Z	nickrud	Shaun2222	and they are all from ubuntu, no third party
2008-02-12T07:52:00.000Z	nickrud	Shaun2222	if you didn't care for rcconf, you might try sysv-rc-conf or sysvconfig
2008-02-12T07:53:00.000Z	nickrud	Shaun2222	and for future ref, ubuntu doesn't really differentiate between runlevels a la redhat
