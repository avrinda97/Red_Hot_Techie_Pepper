2008-07-16T15:36:00.000Z	patrik	copyofjohan	What about: ls -lR directory_name | md5sum
2008-07-16T15:40:00.000Z	copyofjohan	patrik	so Ill get all md5sums for the directory-content. but the best way would be: give a program two directories and it tells whether they are identical or not.
2008-07-16T15:42:00.000Z	patrik	copyofjohan	You could write a BASH-script for that
2008-07-16T15:42:00.000Z	copyofjohan	patrik	I could but i cant...
2008-07-16T15:43:00.000Z	patrik	copyofjohan	But notice that this doesn't check the filecontents, only filesize. So the files could be different but have the same filesize and you wouldn't notice.
2008-07-16T15:43:00.000Z	patrik	copyofjohan	You could if you read: http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/       :)
2008-07-16T15:43:00.000Z	copyofjohan	patrik	I recogniced just that
2008-07-16T15:52:00.000Z	patrik	copyofjohan	I do think you do need to script something for that
2008-07-16T15:53:00.000Z	copyofjohan	patrik	I will give diff -rq a chance. The directories have a size of more than 4G, so lets see how slow, slow is...
2008-07-16T15:55:00.000Z	copyofjohan	patrik	, HymnToLife: thanks for your time
2008-07-16T15:58:00.000Z	copyofjohan	patrik	, HymnToLife: I dont really know if it worked, but it seemes that that diff for two directories on two separate harddisks just took around two minutes.
2008-07-16T16:02:00.000Z	copyofjohan	patrik	HymnToLife: But Im quite sure that it didnt work. diff has quite small filesizelimits...
2008-07-16T16:06:00.000Z	patrik	copyofjohan	I'm gonna write a script for you, brb
2008-07-16T16:11:00.000Z	copyofjohan	patrik	thanks, but I found my program: md5deep
2008-07-16T16:11:00.000Z	patrik	copyofjohan	aha, gotta check it out
2008-07-16T16:16:00.000Z	copyofjohan	patrik	when I say thanks, I mean: thank you very much. writing a bash-script for my problem is a supporteffort I only expect from a paid supportsite.
2008-07-16T16:18:00.000Z	patrik	copyofjohan	np, that's one of the ways I can pay back to the community for using their free software.
2008-07-16T16:19:00.000Z	copyofjohan	patrik	nice
2008-07-16T16:21:00.000Z	copyofjohan	patrik	another cool way I found is: "find . -type f -exec md5sum  {} \;", right?
