2012-10-06T03:31:00.000Z	Songcat		How can I rescue files from a bad hard drive on the Ubuntu Live CD? In all the guides about it there's either a "Computer" icon on Nautilus, or a "Devices" list, and then you can find your hard drive from there, but that's not true for me.
2012-10-06T03:31:00.000Z	szal	Songcat	what exactly is not true for you?
2012-10-06T03:33:00.000Z	Songcat	szal	On the side of Nautilus where bookmarks/Network and things go, there isn't a "Devices" section. There's a Computer section, but not a "Computer" icon anywhere. And no devices show up on the desktop. (I can re-find the guides that want me to use those things if that helps?)
2012-10-06T03:35:00.000Z	szal	Songcat	I guess that the guides you use are outdated then (Gnome 2 vs. Gnome 3/Unity).. and I also guess that the 'Computer' section in Nautilus is what you're looking for (I hardly ever use anything smelling of Gnome ;))
2012-10-06T03:40:00.000Z	Songcat	szal	Where under Computer? /media and /dev under File System are the only things that seem like they could be it, and they just have empty folders. https://dl.dropbox.com/u/16623407/Screenshot%20from%202012-10-05%2017%3A37%3A20.png
2012-10-06T03:42:00.000Z	szal	Songcat	tried /mnt?
2012-10-06T03:42:00.000Z	Songcat	szal	Empty.
2012-10-06T03:43:00.000Z	szal	Songcat	are you sure the device you're looking for is connected, powered, and in working condition?
2012-10-06T03:44:00.000Z	Songcat	szal	I'm trying to view the laptop's main hard drive; I can't boot into it (pretty sure it failed) but apparently I'm supposed to still be able to look at it from the live cd?
2012-10-06T03:44:00.000Z	szal	Songcat	depends on what 'failed' actually means
2012-10-06T03:48:00.000Z	szal	Songcat	indicating that the filesystem is trashed
2012-10-06T03:49:00.000Z	szal	Songcat	in that case your only chance might be connecting that disk to a working Windows system & running chkdsk on it
2012-10-06T03:52:00.000Z	Songcat	szal	I'll try and figure out if I can connect to a Windows system to run chkdsk.
2012-10-06T03:53:00.000Z	szal	Songcat	I don't see an NTFS disk there
2012-10-06T04:03:00.000Z	szal	Songcat	rule of thumb: for hard disk partitions, you can normally omit indicating the fs type in the mount options; the mount command should be able to figure out the fs type by itself
2012-10-06T04:04:00.000Z	Songcat	szal	Thank you! I'll keep that in mind for future mounting.
2012-10-06T04:06:00.000Z	szal	Songcat	unless you need write access to an NTFS partition, then you need to tell it to use ntfs-3g, as the old ntfs option only gives you read access
2012-10-06T04:07:00.000Z	Songcat	szal	If it's non-ntfs, will I have write access?
2012-10-06T04:08:00.000Z	szal	Songcat	yes.. probably only as root, but yes
