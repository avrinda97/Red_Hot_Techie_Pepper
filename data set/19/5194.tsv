2008-12-26T07:44:00.000Z	ruhaan_jslip		how do i save a file in Vi?
2008-12-26T07:44:00.000Z	ruhaan_jslip		the terminal editor
2008-12-26T07:44:00.000Z	unop_	ruhaan_jslip	:w
2008-12-26T07:44:00.000Z	unop_	ruhaan_jslip	or  :write
2008-12-26T07:47:00.000Z	unop_	ruhaan_jslip	you must be in Command Mode for that to work .. press Esc first to get into that mode
2008-12-26T07:47:00.000Z	unop_	ruhaan_jslip	and note it is :w not :W
2008-12-26T07:48:00.000Z	unop_	ruhaan_jslip	pressing Esc switches modes .. type :w after that
2008-12-26T07:52:00.000Z	unop_	ruhaan_jslip	no,  : then q then ENTER/RETURN
2008-12-26T07:52:00.000Z	unop_	ruhaan_jslip	or,  : then w then ENTER
2008-12-26T07:54:00.000Z	unop_	ruhaan_jslip	you're probably not pressing : properly (as you're trying : and w at the same time) - in which case enter will take you to the next line
2008-12-26T07:54:00.000Z	ruhaan_jslip	unop_	i m pressing properly
2008-12-26T07:54:00.000Z	unop_	ruhaan_jslip	 Esc then :  then w then Enter
2008-12-26T07:56:00.000Z	unop_	ruhaan_jslip	it's not entering :q at the very last line, is it?
2008-12-26T07:57:00.000Z	unop_	ruhaan_jslip	what happens when you press : - is that entered anywhere at all ?
2008-12-26T07:58:00.000Z	unop_	ruhaan_jslip	where does it appear?
2008-12-26T07:59:00.000Z	unop_	ruhaan_jslip	 in vim, ex commands i.e. :w  :q  etc are shown at the very last line - which is not part of the text itself , it's the command space
2008-12-26T08:00:00.000Z	unop_	ruhaan_jslip	if you aren't seeing that - i don't think you are using vim - because by all means, you should be seeing this
2008-12-26T08:03:00.000Z	unop_	ruhaan_jslip	you see this here http://sao-paulo.pm.org/papers/alceu/vim4perl/20040510-vim_colorscheme_nightwish.png  - the person is entering an ex command on the very last line (in the command mode)
2008-12-26T08:03:00.000Z	unop_	ruhaan_jslip	heh - no idea
