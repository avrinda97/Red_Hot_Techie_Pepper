2007-11-24T06:58:00.000Z	Sir_Fawnpug	Thumbin	they've always been great about sending CDs. We used to pass them out at our school festivals.
2007-11-24T06:59:00.000Z	Thumbin	Sir_Fawnpug	I remember ordering a TON of cd's back when they first started shipping them for free :P
2007-11-24T06:59:00.000Z	Sir_Fawnpug	Thumbin	it's great, we've gotten quite a few non-cs majors to start using linux at my school
2007-11-24T07:00:00.000Z	Thumbin	Sir_Fawnpug	Same way up here in Oregon
2007-11-24T07:00:00.000Z	Sir_Fawnpug	Thumbin	you remeber whenever that guy from Tuttle threw a fit about CentOS? I actually knew a citizen of that town, and the first thing I said to her after she got online that day was, "Your mayor is an idiot."
2007-11-24T07:01:00.000Z	Thumbin	Sir_Fawnpug	I almost got my wife onto Ubuntu, But oddly enough we couldn't get her wifi card to work on the laptop
2007-11-24T07:02:00.000Z	Sir_Fawnpug	Thumbin	wireless has always been a bit of a pain, even in windows
2007-11-24T07:02:00.000Z	Thumbin	Sir_Fawnpug	so she is currently sitting next to me on her laptop... every 5 mins or so cussing and freaking out about windows constantly crashing :P
2007-11-24T07:02:00.000Z	Sir_Fawnpug	Thumbin	what chipset are you using on that card?
2007-11-24T07:02:00.000Z	Thumbin	Sir_Fawnpug	I was amazed though when I popped in the live cd, My wifi card was automatically detected and running even better than on windows
2007-11-24T07:03:00.000Z	Thumbin	Sir_Fawnpug	The same kind I'm using a ZD1211B
2007-11-24T07:03:00.000Z	Thumbin	Sir_Fawnpug	Yeah, I had no idea what to make of it...
2007-11-24T07:04:00.000Z	Sir_Fawnpug	Thumbin	my laptop is the only machine I have with wireless so I havent gotten to play around much
2007-11-24T07:05:00.000Z	Thumbin	Sir_Fawnpug	both of our computers are running wireless... We use outside wireless connections to connect... Nice and free :)
2007-11-24T07:05:00.000Z	Sir_Fawnpug	Thumbin	I thought about slapping a wireless card into my router but I didn't want to be bothered finding a compatible chipset that does not require ndis wrapper
2007-11-24T07:06:00.000Z	Thumbin	Sir_Fawnpug	I'm just using a cheap usb wifi off of ebay... It's the ZD1211B chipset like I said above and everything works 100% with it
2007-11-24T07:06:00.000Z	Sir_Fawnpug	Thumbin	wellk, I take taht back, my Wii has wireless but I don't think tat would normally count
