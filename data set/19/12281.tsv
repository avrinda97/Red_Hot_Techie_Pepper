2005-09-25T07:11:00.000Z	Dalik01		I have installed mplayer-386 and it crashes because of an audio error.  But I can watch movies without sound if I start it from CLI.  Can anyone help or point me to a fix?
2005-09-25T07:19:00.000Z	Dalik01		ok wmv works with some audio delay
2005-09-25T07:20:00.000Z	Dalik01		hmmm could have been the video
2005-09-25T07:23:00.000Z	Dalik01		only have two wmv files and the 2nd one was right
2005-09-25T07:34:00.000Z	Dalik01		where can I tell where files where installed such as w32codecs package?
2005-09-25T07:34:00.000Z	Dalik01		I need to copy the files to totems plug in dir to get some support and I cant find them
2005-09-25T07:38:00.000Z	apokryphos	Dalik01	I'm pretty sure it should detect them automatically
