2012-04-06T13:36:00.000Z	vectorshelve		how can I change the desktop Interface of Ubuntu ?
2012-04-06T13:36:00.000Z	vectorshelve		from the side task bar to normal.. upper taskbar view ?
2012-04-06T13:36:00.000Z	jrib	vectorshelve	install your preffered desktop environment's package and then choose at the login screen what type of session you would like to start
2012-04-06T13:37:00.000Z	vectorshelve	jrib	yes by default there will be two right
2012-04-06T13:37:00.000Z	jrib	vectorshelve	hmm, which two?
2012-04-06T13:38:00.000Z	vectorshelve	jrib	I just need the very normal interface
2012-04-06T13:38:00.000Z	vectorshelve	jrib	remove the unity interface
2012-04-06T13:38:00.000Z	jrib	vectorshelve	unity is the "normal" (default) interface
2012-04-06T13:39:00.000Z	vectorshelve	jrib	ok then change it to the other UI...
2012-04-06T13:39:00.000Z	vectorshelve	jrib	which is there in the system... or only unity is there by default in the system ?
2012-04-06T13:40:00.000Z	jrib	vectorshelve	I'm not aware of another one available by default.  But you can go to your login screen and see what's available for your session type.
2012-04-06T13:40:00.000Z	vectorshelve	jrib	ok thanks..
2012-04-25T15:55:00.000Z	jrib	vectorshelve	search for info about compiz shortcuts.  It's probably something like "inverse color" or some accessibility option
2012-04-25T15:55:00.000Z	vectorshelve	jrib	ok thanks
2012-04-25T15:56:00.000Z	jrib	vectorshelve	alt-shift-PrintScreen seems like a possibility
2012-04-25T15:57:00.000Z	vectorshelve	jrib	http://www.ehow.com/how_8423829_display-inverse-colors-ubuntu.html helped window + N
2012-04-25T15:57:00.000Z	jrib	vectorshelve	ok
2012-04-25T15:58:00.000Z	vectorshelve	jrib	bt only for the current window
2012-04-25T15:58:00.000Z	vectorshelve	jrib	window+ M for all screens :) worked thanks
