2004-10-28T10:40:00.000Z	usual	LinuxJones	let me explain a little better
2004-10-28T10:40:00.000Z	LinuxJones	usual	you have more than 1 soundcard ?
2004-10-28T10:40:00.000Z	usual	LinuxJones	no the onboard is disabled and the install detected the TV tuner card as a mixer as well
2004-10-28T10:42:00.000Z	LinuxJones	usual	argh you may have to look to google for help. 
2004-10-28T10:45:00.000Z	LinuxJones	usual	you can try adding oss to the /etc/hotplug//blacklist.d/alsa-base file and re-start. That will prevent any oss modules from being loaded for your soundcard  boot time.
