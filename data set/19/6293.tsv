2008-02-15T08:17:00.000Z	norty		How do I edit the Places menu in ubuntu 7.10?
2008-02-15T08:17:00.000Z	prince_jammys	norty	you can only add bookmarks, i don't think you can delete stuff from the menu editor
2008-02-15T08:18:00.000Z	norty	prince_jammys	ive edited the applications and systems menu but places doesn't appear as one of the options to edit from the main menu
2008-02-15T08:18:00.000Z	prince_jammys	norty	right
2008-02-15T08:19:00.000Z	prince_jammys	norty	you can only add stuff, but can't remove stuff ...  you can however, get rid of the menu if its in your way
2008-02-15T08:20:00.000Z	prince_jammys	norty	there is a way but you really dont want to mess with it, trust me
2008-02-15T08:21:00.000Z	prince_jammys	norty	why dont you just remove the menu, and add your own with the stuff you want in it
2008-02-15T08:25:00.000Z	norty	prince_jammys	how do i add a new menu, i can only seem to get it to be a submenu of applications or system
2008-03-05T07:31:00.000Z	prince_jammys	norty	none that you should realistically worry about
2008-03-05T07:32:00.000Z	prince_jammys	norty	don't browse the web as root.  don't login as root
2008-03-10T13:18:00.000Z	prince_jammys	norty	try creating a user with id 112
2008-03-10T13:19:00.000Z	prince_jammys	norty	is there currently a user with id 112?
2008-03-10T13:20:00.000Z	norty	prince_jammys	ok i created the user and now it says the group 120 doesn't exist anymore..
2008-03-10T13:20:00.000Z	prince_jammys	norty	eek
2008-03-10T13:22:00.000Z	prince_jammys	norty	might as well try the install/uninstall you were doing earlier
2008-03-10T13:32:00.000Z	prince_jammys	norty	what about trying to reinstall it and then remove it?
2008-03-10T13:33:00.000Z	norty	prince_jammys	its already installed
2008-03-10T13:33:00.000Z	prince_jammys	norty	yes, but the installation is messed up apparently
2008-03-10T13:33:00.000Z	norty	prince_jammys	if i could just purge and remove everything related to postgres and reinstall that is what i want to do
