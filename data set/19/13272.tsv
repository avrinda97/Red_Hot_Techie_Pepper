2007-08-18T16:57:00.000Z	javaJake	enyc	lol
2007-08-18T16:57:00.000Z	enyc	javaJake	[??] 
2007-08-18T16:57:00.000Z	javaJake	enyc	my guess is cdrecord got replaced by wodim, but wodim is backwards compatible.
2007-08-18T16:57:00.000Z	enyc	javaJake	well yes exactlp
2007-08-18T16:57:00.000Z	javaJake	enyc	therefore any software trying to use cdrecord will still work
2007-08-18T16:57:00.000Z	enyc	javaJake	i know
2007-08-18T16:57:00.000Z	javaJake	enyc	apt-cache show wodim ?
2007-08-18T16:58:00.000Z	enyc	javaJake	wodim is a fork of cdrecord
2007-08-18T16:58:00.000Z	enyc	javaJake	[doesn't say anything about that there] 
2007-08-18T16:58:00.000Z	javaJake	enyc	lol, thought you were the one confused. :P
2007-08-18T16:58:00.000Z	enyc	javaJake	no
2007-08-18T16:58:00.000Z	enyc	javaJake	;-)
2007-08-18T16:58:00.000Z	enyc	javaJake	seemingly cdrecord author has changed license and tried to get money/licensing on cdrecord-prodvd etc.
2007-08-18T16:58:00.000Z	enyc	javaJake	and wodim is a fork from 'before license changing'
2007-08-18T16:59:00.000Z	javaJake	enyc	:O
2007-08-18T16:59:00.000Z	javaJake	enyc	good for them!
2007-08-18T16:59:00.000Z	enyc	javaJake	much like,  X.org is a fork, from before XFree86 changed license
