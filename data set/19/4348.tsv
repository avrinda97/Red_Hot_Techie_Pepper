2009-06-05T03:41:00.000Z	helper		how to make like i want file 2 to copy into file 1 using cat ? does this work ! like cat file1 file2
2009-06-05T03:41:00.000Z	geirha	helper	cat file1 file2 > file3
2009-06-05T03:43:00.000Z	geirha	helper	Or, if you want to append file2 to file1, then (note double >> is append, > is overwrite): cat file2 >> file1
2009-06-05T03:44:00.000Z	helper	geirha	aha sorry but what << this use for echo i always see like echo << for what ?
2009-06-05T03:45:00.000Z	geirha	helper	Hm? Could you paste an example at http://paste.ubuntu.com/ ?
2009-06-05T03:46:00.000Z	helper	geirha	like this : echo ./count <  ./count
2009-06-05T03:47:00.000Z	helper	geirha	does this overwrite
2009-06-05T03:47:00.000Z	geirha	helper	that doesn't make sense. You're sending the content of ./count to echo's stdin, but echo doesn't do anything with stdin.
2009-06-05T03:48:00.000Z	helper	geirha	sorry mean echo ./count < ./count1
2009-06-05T03:48:00.000Z	helper	geirha	okie
2009-06-05T03:48:00.000Z	geirha	helper	Still doesn't make sense. What is it supposed to do?
2009-06-05T03:49:00.000Z	helper	geirha	it doesn't but i usually see it on sites so i was like to know =) seems nothing
2009-06-05T03:50:00.000Z	helper	geirha	so the usefull is > and >> and about cat < ./count it run count shell right ?
2009-06-05T03:50:00.000Z	geirha	helper	It's common to do stuff like "echo something > file" and "echo something >> file"
2009-06-05T03:50:00.000Z	helper	geirha	okie thx
2009-06-05T03:50:00.000Z	geirha	helper	If you want to run a script called count, do "./count"
2009-06-05T03:51:00.000Z	helper	geirha	okie :)
2009-06-05T04:11:00.000Z	helper	geirha	sorry how to use funcation command ?
