2005-11-16T14:20:00.000Z	NoMoXp		hello
2005-11-16T14:21:00.000Z	NoMoXp		I have switched from XP on 3 of my 4 compu ters
2005-11-16T14:21:00.000Z	NoMoXp		there is one product I have not found on Linux
2005-11-16T14:21:00.000Z	NoMoXp		I am wondering if you can help me
2005-11-16T14:21:00.000Z	NoMoXp		I need something comparable to microsoft Visual Studio?
2005-11-16T14:21:00.000Z	Razor-X	NoMoXp	mmmm, that depends
2005-11-16T14:22:00.000Z	Razor-X	NoMoXp	do you want an IDE, or do you just want the programming language?
2005-11-16T14:22:00.000Z	Razor-X	NoMoXp	oh, so you just want to program?
2005-11-16T14:22:00.000Z	Razor-X	NoMoXp	oh, now that's easy
2005-11-16T14:23:00.000Z	Razor-X	NoMoXp	just about every UNIX distribution uses gcc
2005-11-16T14:23:00.000Z	Razor-X	NoMoXp	the standard C compiler
2005-11-16T14:24:00.000Z	Razor-X	NoMoXp	you can also use it (or rather it's variation g++) to program in C++
2005-11-16T14:25:00.000Z	Razor-X	NoMoXp	emacs is a programming environment, it's basically a text editor IDE
2005-11-16T14:25:00.000Z	Razor-X	NoMoXp	it's my own text editor of choice, but if you're *just* looking for a compiler, you have no need of emacs
2005-11-16T14:25:00.000Z	Razor-X	NoMoXp	although emacs will make the developmetn process much smoother
2005-11-16T14:26:00.000Z	Razor-X	NoMoXp	then something like KDevelop will suit you best, although you shouldn't hesitate to check out vim, emacs, and joe
2005-11-16T14:27:00.000Z	Razor-X	NoMoXp	personally, I prefer my emacs in a nice terminal window :)
2005-11-16T14:27:00.000Z	Razor-X	NoMoXp	yes, unfortunately
2005-11-16T14:28:00.000Z	Razor-X	NoMoXp	nopers, just install what you need
