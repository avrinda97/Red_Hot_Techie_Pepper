2007-01-23T13:53:00.000Z	tbf		wondering how a tool which started as light-weighted as maildrop can be as heavy-weighted as maildrop is today
2007-01-23T13:53:00.000Z	tbf		are there reliabled, maildrop replacements?
2007-01-23T13:53:00.000Z	ikonia	tbf	which tool
2007-01-23T13:53:00.000Z	tbf	ikonia	the mail delivery agent
2007-01-23T13:53:00.000Z	ikonia	tbf	which one
2007-01-23T13:53:00.000Z	tbf	ikonia	there are more than one?
2007-01-23T13:54:00.000Z	ikonia	tbf	what makes you think its "heavy" no
2007-01-23T13:55:00.000Z	tbf	ikonia	I've directly installed the "maildrop" package and it expects an entire courier-mail environment (better: authlib env) to be setup
2007-01-23T13:55:00.000Z	tbf	ikonia	well, and then I've done "apt-get source maildrop" and my eyes started rolling
2007-01-23T13:56:00.000Z	tbf	ikonia	(fetched the source for compiling a /usr/local version without authlib crap)
2007-01-23T13:57:00.000Z	ikonia	tbf	I'm not a fan of courier due to authlib - so I sympathise
2007-01-23T13:58:00.000Z	tbf	ikonia	so do you know another reliable mail-filter? procmail is not reliable due it's fallthru behaviour
2007-01-23T13:58:00.000Z	ikonia	tbf	they all have pros/cons - I've found qmail solid, amongst others
2007-01-23T13:59:00.000Z	tbf	ikonia	don't consider qmail to be secure due that stupid license and all the untested custom patches qmail requires today for being up-todate
2007-01-23T14:00:00.000Z	ikonia	tbf	the license - yes a problem. the package "net-qmail" is secure, I can vouch on that
2007-01-23T14:02:00.000Z	tbf	ikonia	well, but what about a simple program reading mails from stdin, filtering it via regexs and dropping it into the proper mailbox?
2007-01-23T14:02:00.000Z	ikonia	tbf	nothing stands out off the top of my head
2007-01-23T14:03:00.000Z	tbf	ikonia	*sig* - in former times maildrop matched that description :-(
2007-01-23T14:03:00.000Z	ikonia	tbf	yes, I can see what your agter
