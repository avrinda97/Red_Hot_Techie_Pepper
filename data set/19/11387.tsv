2007-06-19T06:03:00.000Z	tovella	Nwallins|home	is Nwallins for New Orleans?
2007-06-19T06:03:00.000Z	Nwallins|home	tovella	yup
2007-06-19T06:03:00.000Z	Nwallins|home	tovella	my adopted home :)
2007-06-19T06:04:00.000Z	tovella	Nwallins|home	i thought perhaps that meant you made it BACK home, after katrina.
2007-06-19T06:06:00.000Z	tovella	Nwallins|home	funny, my experience in the Atl is where i got the notion that people pronounce new orleans nwallins...  i spent a year in the Atl, before i could understand my new boss.
2007-06-19T06:06:00.000Z	Nwallins|home	tovella	that is funny, because I never heard it pronounced like my nick until i got there
2007-06-19T06:07:00.000Z	Nwallins|home	tovella	it was always "N'awlins", which is totally inaccurate, from a local perspective
2007-06-19T06:07:00.000Z	tovella	Nwallins|home	even with today
2007-06-19T06:07:00.000Z	tovella	Nwallins|home	even with today's economic conditions, i'm glad to be back in New York.
2007-06-19T06:07:00.000Z	Nwallins|home	tovella	i love the Big Apple -- most of my friends from NO ended up there
2007-06-19T06:08:00.000Z	tovella	Nwallins|home	we're still praying & working (activism) for you all.
2007-06-19T06:09:00.000Z	Nwallins|home	tovella	my heart is still fond, but I've moved on
2007-06-19T06:10:00.000Z	Nwallins|home	tovella	if there were technology work there, I'd certainly consider going back
2007-06-19T06:10:00.000Z	Nwallins|home	tovella	but career opportunities suck, unless you're in construction or gov't
2007-06-19T06:11:00.000Z	tovella	Nwallins|home	keep your ear to the ground...  as more rebuilding gets done, the tech opportunities will come.
2007-06-19T06:12:00.000Z	Nwallins|home	tovella	there are little gigs here and there, but nothing to depend on, at this point.
2007-06-19T06:12:00.000Z	tovella	Nwallins|home	understandable.
2007-06-19T06:13:00.000Z	Nwallins|home	tovella	every time I visit NYC, it seems I end up at BB King's for some NO band, and there is a big NO reunion :)
