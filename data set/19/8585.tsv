2007-03-10T06:05:00.000Z	Jivers		help
2007-03-10T06:07:00.000Z	Jivers		is xchat installed by default with ubuntu?
2007-03-10T06:07:00.000Z	joe4444	Jivers	it was for me
2007-03-10T06:08:00.000Z	joe4444	Jivers	applications > internet
2007-03-10T06:08:00.000Z	joe4444	Jivers	you may have to check system > preferences > menu layout
2007-03-10T06:09:00.000Z	joe4444	Jivers	it's easy from there, just check it out
2007-03-10T06:09:00.000Z	joe4444	Jivers	if it's not there then try Applications > Add/Remove
2007-03-10T06:10:00.000Z	joe4444	Jivers	i'm not sure about that but i don't think preferences requires root privilege
2007-03-10T06:11:00.000Z	joe4444	Jivers	you could start in recovery mode, which will give you root access... then usermod
2007-03-10T06:11:00.000Z	joe4444	Jivers	no, you probably changed your default group instead of /adding/ yourself to another group...
2007-03-10T06:12:00.000Z	joe4444	Jivers	reboot and keep pressing ESC after you see your BIOS summary... it only gives you 1-2 seconds and most of the time i never see the option
2007-03-10T06:13:00.000Z	joe4444	Jivers	for future reference, i like "sudo gpasswd -a username groupname"
2007-03-10T06:14:00.000Z	joe4444	Jivers	that won't change the user's /default/ group
2007-03-10T06:14:00.000Z	joe4444	Jivers	try "gpassword -a username groupname"
2007-03-10T06:15:00.000Z	joe4444	Jivers	if that's the proper group
2007-03-10T06:17:00.000Z	joe4444	Jivers	these are the groups my default user was automatically added to: joe4444 adm dialout cdrom floppy audio dip video plugdev lpadmin scanner admin
2007-03-10T06:20:00.000Z	joe4444	Jivers	i can't recall... check out man usermod
2007-03-10T06:23:00.000Z	joe4444	Jivers	any luck?
