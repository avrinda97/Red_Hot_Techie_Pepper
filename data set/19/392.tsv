2012-03-28T11:38:00.000Z	Coke		Hi. I have a shell script in ~/bin/myscript.sh, is it possible to make it available when searching in "Home" and possibly put it in the launcher?
2012-03-28T11:38:00.000Z	Kotus	Coke	available?
2012-03-28T11:38:00.000Z	Coke	Kotus	when I search for it, it's nowhere
2012-03-28T11:38:00.000Z	Coke	Kotus	I have made myscript.desktop in .local/share/appliactions
2012-03-28T11:39:00.000Z	Coke	Kotus	it doesnt show up when searching nor can I put it in the launcher
2012-03-28T11:40:00.000Z	Kotus	Coke	export PATH=$PATH:/home/name/bin i think
2012-03-28T11:41:00.000Z	Kotus	Coke	i dont think ~/bin/ gets included so you can add export PATH=.. to ~/.bash_profile ( or ~/.bashrc )
2012-03-28T11:42:00.000Z	Kotus	Coke	if you don't understand do echo $PATH :)
2012-03-28T11:43:00.000Z	Coke	Kotus	thats not what im asking for
2012-03-28T11:43:00.000Z	Coke	Kotus	I'm asking to have it in the SEARCH when you press the ubuntu logo
2012-03-28T11:43:00.000Z	Coke	Kotus	I also want to add it to the launcher on the left
2012-03-28T11:44:00.000Z	Coke	Kotus	but that's not what I want.
2012-03-28T11:46:00.000Z	Coke	Kotus	drag it from where?
2012-03-28T11:46:00.000Z	Coke	Kotus	using what?
2012-03-28T11:47:00.000Z	Coke	Kotus	unfortunately, it doesnt show hidden dirs
2012-03-28T11:48:00.000Z	Coke	Kotus	and my desktop file is in ~/.local/share/applications
2012-03-28T11:53:00.000Z	Coke	Kotus	for next time, here's how to do it http://www.liberiangeek.net/2011/11/create-desktop-shortcuts-icons-in-ubuntu-11-10-oneiric-ocelot/
2012-03-28T11:53:00.000Z	Coke	Kotus	you can then drag and drop
2012-03-28T11:57:00.000Z	Coke	Kotus	i'd like to stay and chat, but got a meeting
