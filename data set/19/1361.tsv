2011-02-15T16:39:00.000Z	borgeshsmorg		I see. On this client I can enter  /server irc.freenode.net     and log in here.
2011-02-15T16:41:00.000Z	borgeshsmorg		So I would enter:   /server  <ipaddress:6667>
2011-02-15T16:42:00.000Z	borgeshsmorg		I see. I was trying to make it a bit easier for people that I want to log into my server once set up. I also would like to set up chat web pages where others can talk in real time. I suppose a DNS daemon may help there too.
2011-02-15T16:44:00.000Z	borgeshsmorg		I think I get the idea Wulfy. Thanks.
2011-02-15T16:44:00.000Z	Wulfy	borgeshsmorg	 no worrys
2011-02-15T16:36:00.000Z	Wulfy	borgeshsmorg	no you would use ip:6667 (unless you was using dyndns etc
2011-02-15T16:26:00.000Z	Wulfy	borgeshsmorg	 you could tell your router to give your server a perminant internal ip
2011-02-15T16:26:00.000Z	Wulfy	borgeshsmorg	 and then once you have setup a static ip for your server (via the router) you would then do port forwarding 80 and what ever other ports you wanted operning
2011-02-15T16:28:00.000Z	Wulfy	borgeshsmorg	yes your external ip may be dynamic but if you tell your router to "save" the internal ip your server has now you can then setup port forwarding to that ip as your internal ip shouldnt change
2011-02-15T16:29:00.000Z	Wulfy	borgeshsmorg	 affraid.org isnt any differnt in ease of use with regards to setup/use and most routers support it as much as dyndns
2011-02-15T16:29:00.000Z	Wulfy	borgeshsmorg	 sorry afraid.org
2011-02-15T16:30:00.000Z	borgeshsmorg	Wulfy	thanks for the advice.
2011-02-15T16:30:00.000Z	Wulfy	borgeshsmorg	 no worrys
2011-02-15T16:33:00.000Z	borgeshsmorg	Wulfy	would I need to do the same with the router if I wanted to set up a private IRC daemon set up a STATIC address for the same server and asign a port number?
2011-02-15T16:34:00.000Z	Wulfy	borgeshsmorg	 you would use the same internal ip and simpley port forward to the irc dameon port so you would open 80,6667 (for example)
2011-02-15T16:38:00.000Z	borgeshsmorg	Wulfy	so I would enter   server.28.222.15.21:6667    just as an example?
2011-02-15T16:39:00.000Z	Wulfy	borgeshsmorg	 no unless you have a domain name such as one from dyndns you cant use server.ip.net:portnumber you have to use ip:port
2011-02-15T16:41:00.000Z	Wulfy	borgeshsmorg	 that is because the domain irc.freenode.net translates into a ip as they have domain records set for it once you get a domaion name from afraid.org or dyndns you can then setup A records for your ip which will then translate into domain name > ip
2011-02-15T16:44:00.000Z	Wulfy	borgeshsmorg	 can you please add my name to your messages so i can track them, and  yes as your WAN ip will change every now and then it is best to setup a dyndns account
