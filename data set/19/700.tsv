2011-10-11T23:27:00.000Z	g0rs	scorinitron	Thre are anonymous proxy servers some of which are free, you'd have to pay for others which offer proxy and high bandwidth.
2011-10-11T23:28:00.000Z	scorinitron	g0rs	is their a way you can show me how?
2011-10-11T23:28:00.000Z	g0rs	scorinitron	samair.ru lists a few proxy servers. I'd warn you that their speed is very slow.
2011-10-11T23:29:00.000Z	scorinitron	g0rs	anyone recommended?
2011-10-11T23:29:00.000Z	g0rs	scorinitron	pick something from their proxy server list. USually they mention their uptime and country. it is better to choose any county other than usa.
