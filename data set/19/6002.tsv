2008-06-21T20:32:00.000Z	lopin		Hello!  I'm putting together a desktop for a friend with a low low power computer.  He wants a very light weight and feature-less word processor.  He was upset with Abiword.  Is there another one I can use for him?  An alternative to wordpad?

2008-06-21T20:32:00.000Z	lopin	gordonjcp	Thank you!
2008-06-21T20:32:00.000Z	gordonjcp	lopin	pyroom is similar to writeroom on the Mac
2009-01-22T19:01:00.000Z	gordonjcp	lopin	they either work or they don't.  I've found the SAA-whatever analogue tuners to work pretty well
2009-01-22T19:03:00.000Z	lopin	gordonjcp	The one that I have is Generic as all hell.  I don't know what card number to pass to the module.  And, I can't even find a list of proper tuner numbers, either...
2009-01-22T19:03:00.000Z	gordonjcp	lopin	do you even know what chip is on it?  What does lspci say?
2009-01-22T19:05:00.000Z	lopin	gordonjcp	It's definitely a phillips saa7130...
2009-01-22T19:05:00.000Z	gordonjcp	lopin	does it need any specific option?  I'm using one in another machine for capturing analogue video off tape
2009-01-22T19:06:00.000Z	lopin	gordonjcp	that's what I'm thinking, but I have a list of about 140 different card specific options, and the tuner options doesn't have a list anywhere...
2009-01-22T19:06:00.000Z	lopin	gordonjcp	I'm more than happy to sit my happy rear here and do all of them one by one, but if I don't even know the possible values...
2009-01-22T19:07:00.000Z	lopin	gordonjcp	I know that the windows driver, when installed, might be able to tell me more, but I can't get windows running on this box yet...
2009-01-22T19:07:00.000Z	gordonjcp	lopin	and it doesn't work with just *no* options?  I used a cheap crappy Packard-Bell card that was about a tenner in PC World, it worked perfectly with no options
2009-01-22T19:08:00.000Z	lopin	gordonjcp	I'm not getting it to work...
2009-01-22T19:08:00.000Z	lopin	gordonjcp	And, it's missing the eeprom, so linux has no freakin clue as to which it is...
2009-01-22T19:08:00.000Z	gordonjcp	lopin	not sure, then
2009-01-22T19:09:00.000Z	lopin	gordonjcp	Well, do you know of where I can look to get the numbers to set it to NTSC, so I can just go through the 140, instead of the 140xwhatever?
2009-01-22T19:10:00.000Z	gordonjcp	lopin	not offhand, I didn't need to fiddle with mine at all :-/
2009-01-22T19:11:00.000Z	lopin	gordonjcp	Well, thanks anyway.  I appreciate the help...
