2007-05-19T15:36:00.000Z	viator	purpzey	did you install kde?
2007-05-19T15:36:00.000Z	purpzey	viator	No, I am running gnome as off the LiveCD.
2007-05-19T15:36:00.000Z	viator		oh your running the live cd
2007-05-19T15:37:00.000Z	purpzey	viator	No no
2007-05-19T15:37:00.000Z	purpzey	viator	I just meant, I didn't install anything that wasn't on the liveCD...I only installed on this computer yesterday...I haven't really even added any packages.
2007-05-19T15:38:00.000Z	viator		ok is the sutdown missing from gdm ?
2007-05-19T15:38:00.000Z	purpzey		Yes. But, I did the shutdown via terminal...so I will give you a report as soon as gnome boots back up
2007-05-19T15:38:00.000Z	purpzey	viator	Thing is, I might not care...Normally I just hibernate, but I've been hearing that, that can be chancy with ubuntu
2007-05-19T15:39:00.000Z	viator		so its only missing from gdm purpzey
2007-05-19T15:39:00.000Z	viator		?
2007-05-19T15:39:00.000Z	purpzey	viator	As of now, yes. But like I said, I am booting back up right now and I'll let you know if this restart alleviated the issue
2007-05-19T15:39:00.000Z	viator		ok cool
2007-05-19T15:40:00.000Z	purpzey	viator	Yeah there it is....It must have been because I logged in manually via bash and restarted X-Server.
2007-05-19T15:41:00.000Z	viator		yeah also you can goto system administration login window
2007-05-19T15:41:00.000Z	purpzey	viator	Which is bizarre anyway...but
2007-05-19T15:41:00.000Z	viator		and look in local
2007-05-19T15:41:00.000Z	viator		and see if show actions menu
2007-05-19T15:41:00.000Z	viator		is ticked
2007-05-19T15:42:00.000Z	purpzey	viator	That makes sense.....On the flip-side of the coin, is it true that hibernation is an iffy thing to do?
