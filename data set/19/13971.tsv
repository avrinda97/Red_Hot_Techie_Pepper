2005-01-14T11:03:00.000Z	setite		after several several hours i got ubuntu installed
2005-01-14T11:04:00.000Z	setite		took about 5 hours to get windows to let me defragment the drive... it wouldnt let me do it without running chkdsk /f... which refused to run
2005-01-14T11:04:00.000Z	setite		now i need help
2005-01-14T11:04:00.000Z	setite		the time is wrong
2005-01-14T11:04:00.000Z	setite		how do i make it synchronize
2005-01-14T11:04:00.000Z	setite		it says i need to run NTP support
2005-01-14T11:04:00.000Z	Managu	setite	everything else working?
2005-01-14T11:05:00.000Z	Managu	setite	is the time correct in windows?
2005-01-14T11:05:00.000Z	Managu	setite	oh fun.  Lemme see -- it's a timezone problem, then?
2005-01-14T11:05:00.000Z	Managu	setite	i.e. the time is off by a few hours?
2005-01-14T11:06:00.000Z	Managu	setite	oh, ok.  You probably want to install the "ntpdate" package
2005-01-14T11:07:00.000Z	Managu	setite	ntpdate will run automatically at boot time to sync the time to the ubuntu ntp server.  That is assuming that networking is going ok
2005-01-14T11:07:00.000Z	Managu	setite	if you want to run it RIGHT NOW!, you need to run "sudo ntpdate <ntp server>"
2005-01-14T11:08:00.000Z	Managu	setite	at the risk of being a heretic, I use (oh, I forget now) time.windows.com as my ntp server
2005-01-14T11:11:00.000Z	Managu	setite	looks good
2005-01-14T11:11:00.000Z	Managu	setite	get some mp3s?
2005-01-14T11:34:00.000Z	Managu	setite	"auto" = always mount
2005-01-14T11:34:00.000Z	Managu	setite	"uid=1000" = all files on this partition are made to look like they're owned by the user with the ID of 1000
