2008-09-08T04:45:00.000Z	anom01y		how can I get my IVTV drivers working ? I tried following the instructions on the Ubuntu web site w/ no luck, one of the commands there gives me an error
2008-09-08T04:46:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	anom01y	what card are you trying to get working
2008-09-08T04:46:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	anom01y	that card is easy, it should be pretty straightforward
2008-09-08T04:47:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	anom01y	ok, lets start from the beginning...
2008-09-08T04:47:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	anom01y	have you installed ivtv-utils?(sudo apt-get install ivtv-utils)
2008-09-08T04:47:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	anom01y	ok, do ou have VLC installed?
2008-09-08T04:48:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	anom01y	open vlc
2008-09-08T04:48:00.000Z	anom01y	IndyGunFreak	vlc is open btw
2008-09-08T04:50:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	anom01y	did that work?
2008-09-08T04:50:00.000Z	anom01y	IndyGunFreak	no
2008-09-08T04:51:00.000Z	anom01y	IndyGunFreak	I tried mplayer /dev/video0 and that did not work either
2008-09-08T04:51:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	anom01y	weird, mine worked out of the box everytime.
2008-09-08T04:52:00.000Z	anom01y	IndyGunFreak	I did some of the instructions on the ubuntu web site and got half through them, maybe some of the commands I used screwed it up ?
2008-09-08T04:52:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	anom01y	maybe.
2008-09-08T04:53:00.000Z	anom01y	IndyGunFreak	I did everything including change the sources.list
2008-09-08T04:53:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	anom01y	change the sources list?.. there shoul have been no need for that
2008-09-08T04:55:00.000Z	anom01y	IndyGunFreak	maybe after I install ivtv utils do I have to reboot the computer ? or add the drivers to the kernel ?
2008-09-08T04:55:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	anom01y	no, you shouldn't have to do any of that... basically, this is how i've set that card up since dapper on clean installs.
2008-09-08T05:00:00.000Z	anom01y	IndyGunFreak	is there a daemon or something that has to be running ???
