2008-11-18T07:49:00.000Z	luigi		why i get "mount: the special device /dev/disk/by-uuid/fb9d5a70-a92d-428a-a44f-e80de77b1bb1 non exist"?
2008-11-18T07:49:00.000Z	jamesish	luigi	the special device presumably doesn't exist.
2008-11-18T07:49:00.000Z	luigi	jamesish	i've already create this one!
2008-11-18T07:51:00.000Z	luigi	jamesish	and i read the UUID with vol_id
2008-11-18T07:52:00.000Z	jamesish	luigi	there's some questions here. First, how did you make the special device?
2008-11-18T07:52:00.000Z	jamesish	luigi	second, how did you set permissions on it?
2008-11-18T07:52:00.000Z	jamesish	luigi	third, *why* did you make it? These things typically pop into existence when needed
2008-11-18T07:52:00.000Z	jamesish	luigi	and for good measure, what're you trying to do? ;)
2008-11-18T07:55:00.000Z	luigi	jamesish	 ok... i'm going to set my new HD with fstab.. i cut it in two part with gparted. so i have /dev/sdb1 and sdb2. after i've read the vol_id in ordet to put the uuid in fstab. at the moment sdb1 work, but sbd2 no.
2008-11-18T07:56:00.000Z	luigi	jamesish	this is the sdb2 in fstab: UUID=fb9d5a70-a92d-428a-a44f-e80de77b1bb1 /media/sdb2  ext3  defaults  0  0
2008-11-18T08:00:00.000Z	jamesish	luigi	why aren't you letting gnome take care of mounting it for you?>
2008-11-18T08:01:00.000Z	jamesish	luigi	Ah, sorry. Reading further back. I see.
2008-11-18T08:01:00.000Z	jamesish	luigi	Okay.
2008-11-18T08:01:00.000Z	luigi	jamesish	ok
2008-11-18T08:01:00.000Z	luigi	jamesish	i'm going to try to re format this device..
2008-11-18T08:02:00.000Z	jamesish	luigi	why are you mounting by UUID? I'm lost there.
2008-11-18T08:02:00.000Z	jamesish	luigi	I always mount by partition.
2008-11-18T08:02:00.000Z	luigi		i wont that at each logon ubuntu auto mount my device!
2008-11-18T08:03:00.000Z	luigi	jamesish	 i want that at each logon ubuntu auto mount my device!
