2008-04-09T02:46:00.000Z	smithey93		hey, anyone know why devede would make dvds that are like, not right
2008-04-09T02:48:00.000Z	webtoe	smithey93	like how?
2008-04-09T02:48:00.000Z	webtoe	smithey93	how did you make the dvd?
2008-04-09T02:49:00.000Z	smithey93	webtoe	i just added the video file, made a menu and clicked go
2008-04-09T02:49:00.000Z	webtoe	smithey93	sorry i asked a stupid quetion, did you check that the video was fine before you added it? and what programme did you use to make the dvd?
2008-04-09T02:50:00.000Z	smithey93	webtoe	i used devede, the weird thing is, is that it works on my old pc but not my new
2008-04-09T02:50:00.000Z	webtoe	smithey93	are you trying to watch it through a tele?
2008-04-09T02:51:00.000Z	smithey93	webtoe	yea, on my dvd player, ive tried it on meny, and it failed on all
2008-04-09T02:52:00.000Z	webtoe	smithey93	hmmm, that's something odd. I'm not sure about that dvd programme then. I was thinking maybe your tele didn't like the composite signal from your dvd playing equipment (as that can sometimes lead to black and white signals)
2008-04-09T02:52:00.000Z	smithey93	webtoe	do you know of any simlar software to do so? with my booting into windows because i binned off windows off my pc :)
2008-04-09T02:54:00.000Z	webtoe	smithey93	Not off the top of my head! I have to admit I use a mac for that sort of thing. Never tried on Linux. I'm sure there probably is. Either google or look in the repositories for it maybe
2008-04-09T02:54:00.000Z	smithey93	webtoe	ill take a look, and google it etc, i want a mac :( i wouldnt mind a iMac =]
2008-04-09T02:55:00.000Z	webtoe	smithey93	Beware the iMac. Apparently the screens are pretty shitty compared to LCD's you can get cheap nowadays
2008-04-09T02:55:00.000Z	smithey93	webtoe	really? thanks for that, therefore ill get a mac mini, and just kvm it with my 22"
2008-04-09T02:56:00.000Z	webtoe	smithey93	Apparently. It was on www.theregister.co.uk the other day
2008-04-09T02:56:00.000Z	smithey93	webtoe	interesting, i always thought macs hardware was real pro
2008-04-09T02:57:00.000Z	webtoe	smithey93	I'm a fanboy and I thought that too!
2008-04-09T02:58:00.000Z	webtoe	smithey93	but I think their iMacs are their cheaper version nowadays. the macbooks should be ok and you can use any lcd you like with their powermacs. And their horrendously expensive LCDS are oogd
2008-04-09T03:02:00.000Z	smithey93	webtoe	i love my lg 22" screen tbh
