2006-01-17T10:18:00.000Z	Ng	_jason	reboot into recovery mode then
2006-01-17T10:19:00.000Z	_jason	Ng	if you can walk him through that, go for it.  I've always gotten a prompt for a root password when i tried it
2006-01-17T10:19:00.000Z	Ng	_jason	you only get prompted for a root password if you've set a root password
2006-01-17T10:19:00.000Z	_jason	Ng	I've set and disabled it
2006-01-17T10:20:00.000Z	Ng	_jason	well you either founnd a bug or disabled it incorrectly then
2006-01-17T10:21:00.000Z	_jason	Ng	I just did sudo passwd -l root
2006-01-17T10:21:00.000Z	_jason	Ng	but I'll check in a little while to be sure
2006-03-04T09:31:00.000Z	Ng	_jason	I use irssi, what's the prob?
2006-03-04T09:31:00.000Z	_jason	Ng	just wondering if LinuxIdiot does because he is dualbooting and in windows right now
2006-03-04T09:31:00.000Z	_jason	Ng	he has no X
2006-03-07T08:46:00.000Z	Ng	_jason	arroy keys/page down keys?
2006-03-07T08:46:00.000Z	Ng	_jason	surely some actual punctuation is preferably? ;)
2006-03-07T08:46:00.000Z	_jason	Ng	heh I thought that might get confused :)
