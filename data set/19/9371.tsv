2007-01-02T14:01:00.000Z	logivision		I'm looking to use PC Anywhere on my Ubuntu machine but it doesn't support it, it only supports SuSe and Red Hat, is there a way to make it work on Ubuntu Anyways ?
2007-01-02T14:03:00.000Z	rasman	logivision	you might also want to look at nomachine and freenx for an RDP type service for Linux
2007-01-02T14:06:00.000Z	rasman	logivision	does this need to reverse a tunnel over NAT?
2007-01-02T14:08:00.000Z	rasman	logivision	will you have the ability to open ports to the machines like port 22?
2007-01-02T14:09:00.000Z	rasman	logivision	next question; do you need the ability to work on the desktop for extended periods of time or just a quick gui from time to time
2007-01-02T14:10:00.000Z	rasman	logivision	will you need to share the screen with a user on the other end?
2007-01-02T14:12:00.000Z	rasman	logivision	the easiest way would be to use Gnome's VNC server: System --> Preferences --> Remote Desktop
2007-01-02T14:12:00.000Z	rasman	logivision	make sure that you set the password and don't require confirmation
2007-01-02T14:13:00.000Z	rasman	logivision	before or after their account is created?
2007-01-02T14:15:00.000Z	rasman	logivision	this should work.  I would also look into x11vnc
2007-01-02T14:16:00.000Z	rasman	logivision	go to System --> Admin --> Login Window and set up an autologon account either by time (ie. 10 seconds) or everytime
2007-01-02T14:18:00.000Z	rasman	logivision	also make sure that you get ssh access to the computers.  That way you can modify the remote settings.
2007-01-02T14:20:00.000Z	rasman	logivision	ssh or openssh.  It is an encrypted command line method that gives you the keys to the kingdom
2007-01-02T14:21:00.000Z	rasman	logivision	In fact, I would suggest that you encrypt your remote desktop sessions over it.  Otherwise any keystroke typed and video received will be transmitted in the clear
2007-01-02T14:22:00.000Z	rasman	logivision	just enable it and make gnome automatically login with a user.
2007-01-02T14:22:00.000Z	rasman	logivision	yup.  I like tightvnc
2007-01-02T14:25:00.000Z	rasman	logivision	ifconfig -- also before sending these computers out.  Make sure to install openssh-server if you have a strong admin password.
2007-01-02T14:25:00.000Z	rasman	logivision	you'll thank me later on :)
2007-01-02T14:26:00.000Z	rasman	logivision	you can use putty from windows and ssh from a linux client
