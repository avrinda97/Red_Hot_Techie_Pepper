2007-06-07T16:14:00.000Z	keith1234		it probably has a higher-resolution timer than the 8254 anyway. that's legacy stuff, shouldn't really matter... anyone?
2007-06-07T16:16:00.000Z	keith1234		and 82 is swap, isn't it?
2007-06-07T16:17:00.000Z	keith1234		my NTFS partition is type "7"
2007-06-07T16:19:00.000Z	keith1234		yep ;-)
2007-06-07T16:19:00.000Z	keith1234		install mysql, install php, install mysql module for php
2007-06-07T16:20:00.000Z	keith1234		you want to override what the MX in their DNS says?
2007-06-07T16:20:00.000Z	keith1234		i have joomla installed, somwhere...
2007-06-07T16:22:00.000Z	kitche	keith1234	joomla is probbaly in the apache doc root most likely
2007-06-07T16:28:00.000Z	kitche	keith1234	it wants mysql
2007-06-07T16:29:00.000Z	kitche	keith1234	not many web apps use postgresql
2007-06-07T16:29:00.000Z	kitche	keith1234	I haven't found one that uses it yet :)
2007-06-07T16:30:00.000Z	keith1234	kitche	we have gallery2, drupal, horde, roundcube, egroupware, all running on postgres
2007-06-07T16:31:00.000Z	kitche	keith1234	drupal might since it needs a stronger database but mysql is the standard at least right now so a lot use mysql
2007-06-07T16:31:00.000Z	keith1234	kitche	oh, definitely. few things *require* postgres. but lots of things *work* with it
2007-06-07T16:33:00.000Z	kitche	keith1234	maybe the new drupal uses postgres I tried it a few months ago and only could find mysql option myself, but most groupware does use postgres at least from what I seen but I was mostly talking about CMS's
2007-06-07T16:33:00.000Z	kitche	keith1234	since drupal is more of a framework then a CMS
2007-06-07T05:43:00.000Z	keith1234	kitche	you can killall -9, no?
2007-06-07T05:43:00.000Z	kitche	keith1234	no clue I just run killall when I use killall
2007-06-07T05:44:00.000Z	keith1234	kitche	i think you can use killall -9
