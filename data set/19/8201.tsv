2007-05-11T06:58:00.000Z	xSUSHix	yimmmmy	grub is automatically installed when you install ubuntu
2007-05-11T07:03:00.000Z	xSUSHix	yimmmmy	when you turn on the comoputer - what and where is the error
2007-05-11T07:03:00.000Z	xSUSHix	yimmmmy	re-install ubuntu
2007-05-11T07:05:00.000Z	xSUSHix	yimmmmy	ubuntu is your only operating system ?
2007-05-11T07:07:00.000Z	xSUSHix	yimmmmy	boot from cd - open terminal - type grub - enter root (hd0,0) - then setup (hd0)
2007-05-11T07:08:00.000Z	xSUSHix	yimmmmy	- so grub, root (hd0,0), setup (hd0)
2007-05-11T07:08:00.000Z	xSUSHix	yimmmmy	- terminal is in accessories
2007-05-11T07:10:00.000Z	xSUSHix	yimmmmy	that is not all it said was it
2007-05-11T07:11:00.000Z	xSUSHix	yimmmmy	re-install ubuntu tell it to use the entire hard disk
2007-05-11T07:11:00.000Z	xSUSHix	yimmmmy	use the whole hard disk - and later if you need a partition for some reason you can resize it to be smaller
2007-05-11T07:38:00.000Z	xSUSHix	yimmmmy	- u might have to partition manually using the manual partition option - its pretty intuitive and you should be able to figure it out
2007-05-11T08:22:00.000Z	xSUSHix	yimmmmy	boot from cd and use gparted to make an ext3 partition and format it
2007-05-11T08:22:00.000Z	xSUSHix	yimmmmy	- make sure you click apply
2007-05-11T08:22:00.000Z	xSUSHix	yimmmmy	are you using the x86 ubuntu cdrom ?
