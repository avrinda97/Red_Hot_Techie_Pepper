2009-09-23T20:48:00.000Z	sartan		heya.  Around 2PM every day, ubuntu decides to apply dhcp to eth0.  I've removed network-manager, and i'm only using a static IP in /etc/network/interfaces.  What exactly would cause this behavior?
2009-09-23T20:49:00.000Z	n08l3J	sartan	check the logs for it
2009-09-23T20:50:00.000Z	n08l3J		How you guys use your ipod to sync with ubunutu ?
2009-09-23T20:50:00.000Z	sartan	n08l3J	that's the first place I checked. unfortunately there truly is nothing
2009-09-23T20:50:00.000Z	n08l3J		what music players u prefer / recommend
2009-09-23T20:50:00.000Z	n08l3J	sartan	did you tried re-installing network-manager to see if the problem dissappears ?
2009-09-23T20:51:00.000Z	sartan	n08l3J	this was happening before network-manager was removed too.
2009-09-23T20:51:00.000Z	sartan		I removed network-manager as it was doing other funky dhcp things with my 14 usb ethernet adapters.
2009-09-23T20:52:00.000Z	n08l3J		thanks revygttam
2009-09-23T20:52:00.000Z	sartan		is it signifigant that /etc/network/interfaces is; "auto eth0; iface eth0 inet static" - auto and iface on two different lines?
2009-09-23T20:52:00.000Z	n08l3J	sartan	you can always try it, to see if that make any difference ?
2009-09-23T20:53:00.000Z	n08l3J		i m not getting this 2AM thing
2009-09-23T20:53:00.000Z	sartan		:P
2009-09-23T20:53:00.000Z	n08l3J		whay at that time
2009-09-23T20:53:00.000Z	sartan		2PM
2009-09-23T20:53:00.000Z	n08l3J		yah 2PM
2009-09-23T20:53:00.000Z	sartan		I've no idea either. I thought it was a cronjob but there's nothing there
2009-09-23T20:53:00.000Z	sartan		when removing auto eth0, the interface doesn't start when i restart /etc/init.d/networking.
2009-09-23T20:53:00.000Z	n08l3J	sartan	can u manually start it using ifconfig eth0 up ?
