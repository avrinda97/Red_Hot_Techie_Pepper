2010-06-17T02:45:00.000Z	magicianlord		what does this mean: error inserting wl.ko -1 invalid module format
2010-06-17T02:45:00.000Z	AAA	magicianlord	 that module is not compatable with your kernel
2010-06-17T02:46:00.000Z	magicianlord	AAA	ok man. i thought anything at 2.6.32-(ANYTHING) would work. i compiled wl.ko under ubuntu and am trying to use it uder base debian squeeze install, but i guess not, huh
2010-06-17T02:47:00.000Z	AAA	magicianlord	 you'll want to compile it with the same kernel source your are running on the debian box
2010-06-17T02:49:00.000Z	magicianlord	AAA	is the kernel version the only factor? does it matter if i compile it under different hardware?
2010-06-17T02:52:00.000Z	AAA	magicianlord	 kernel version
2010-06-17T02:54:00.000Z	AAA	magicianlord	 it may, but it is best to compile for your specific kernel
2010-06-17T02:55:00.000Z	AAA	magicianlord	 you can also try to modprobe -f wl
2010-06-17T02:56:00.000Z	AAA	magicianlord	 there are a few modprobe --force-* options; man modprobe for more infoz

2010-06-17T03:08:00.000Z	magicianlord	AAA	command not found
