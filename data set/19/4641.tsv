2009-01-30T05:30:00.000Z	dou213	thief`	the cmd i ran was > sudo /dev/sdc1 /media/sdc1
2009-01-30T05:32:00.000Z	thief`	dou213	after that, google mount usb fstab   - there is good info in there, to edit the fstab and make life happier.
2009-01-30T05:32:00.000Z	thief`	dou213	 first type sudo mkdir /media/greenusbkey
2009-01-30T05:32:00.000Z	thief`	dou213	 then type sudo mount /dev/sdc1 /media/greenusbkey

2009-01-30T05:37:00.000Z	thief`	dou213	that means your usb key has nothing on it.

2009-01-30T05:38:00.000Z	dou213	thief`	why the error when trying to mount?
