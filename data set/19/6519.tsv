2011-01-08T20:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	javad	sudo dpkg -i  filemane.deb    or you can double click them in nautilus
2011-01-08T20:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	javad	did you open the ISO with your CD burner to burn the data?
2011-01-08T20:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	javad	did you burn the image as an image, or as data so the CD only has one file on it?
2011-01-08T20:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	javad	do you have the .ISO file?
2011-01-08T20:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	javad	you can simply mount the ISO file and read that
2011-01-08T20:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	javad	then I suggest you recreate the ISO
2011-01-08T20:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	javad	reuse aptoncd to recreate the ISO
2011-01-08T20:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	javad	its a command to install 2 packages
2011-01-08T20:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	javad	which service?
2011-01-08T21:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	javad	I think you need to be identified to get in the #c channel
