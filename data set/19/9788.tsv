2007-06-01T16:29:00.000Z	axeeOo		hay guys, I have a strange problem; it seems the only way I can get my Linux distro (ubuntu) to boot is to wait for an initramfs error along the lines of: "job control turned off", upon getting this error I type "modprobe piix", then "exit" and it boots. I have added "piix" to /etc/modules and /etc/initramfs/modules and it *still* wont boot. ideas?
2007-06-01T05:06:00.000Z	axeeOo		guys, the only way I can get my system to boot from hdd is to type "modprobe piix" each time, could someone help me fix this please
2007-06-01T05:07:00.000Z	mwe	axeeOo	how do you type that before booting?
2007-06-01T05:08:00.000Z	mwe	axeeOo	if you just want to know how to autoload a module, the answer is to put the name of it in /etc/modules
2007-06-01T05:08:00.000Z	axeeOo	mwe	I get an "initramfs" error regarding job control being turned off, I type "modprobe piix" then "exit". The system boots
2007-06-01T05:09:00.000Z	axeeOo	mwe	I have "piix" saved in both /etc/modules and /etc/initramfs-tools/modules, it still refuses to boot though
2007-06-01T05:09:00.000Z	mwe	axeeOo	how do you modprobe before booting?
2007-06-01T05:10:00.000Z	axeeOo	mwe	once booted it's fine - I just need to modprobe piix EVERY time i reboot, rather annoying :-)
2007-06-01T05:11:00.000Z	mwe	axeeOo	maybe you need to modify the initramfs to include the module for some reason. I must admit I'm not into the details, though. Maybe someone else knows better
2007-06-01T05:12:00.000Z	mwe	axeeOo	did you rebuild the initramfs after adding it to /etc/initramfs-tools/modules?
2007-06-01T05:12:00.000Z	axeeOo	mwe	using "update-initramfs -u"? If so, yes
2007-06-01T05:13:00.000Z	mwe	axeeOo	hmm
2007-06-01T05:13:00.000Z	mwe	axeeOo	I don't know then
2007-06-01T05:13:00.000Z	mwe	axeeOo	it sounds out of the ordinary
2007-06-01T05:15:00.000Z	mwe	axeeOo	I guess you're unlucky. It's been pretty painless for me for almost two years now
2007-06-01T05:16:00.000Z	mwe	axeeOo	a radical approach would be building your own kernel with that driver built in
2007-06-01T05:18:00.000Z	axeeOo	mwe	I've compiled kernels before, I actually ran the module-assistant looking for piix but I couldn't find it, I don't suppose you know which module would need to be loaded do you?
2007-06-01T05:18:00.000Z	mwe	axeeOo	I don't know what it is to be honest
2007-06-01T05:19:00.000Z	mwe	axeeOo	what is it a driver for?
