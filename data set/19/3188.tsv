2009-11-08T15:36:00.000Z	zetheroo	j1mp492	hmmm ,... not anything I have heard of yet
2009-11-08T15:37:00.000Z	j1mp492	zetheroo	well its Sound Blaster.
2009-11-08T15:38:00.000Z	zetheroo	j1mp492	and it worked in Jaunty?
2009-11-08T15:39:00.000Z	j1mp492	zetheroo	yep, perfect. It works now too, but is very glitchy, hard to explain..
2009-11-08T15:42:00.000Z	zetheroo	j1mp492	I understand what you mean. I too have had a few quirks with one machine ,.... nothing major at all ... just a click or so every now and then ... seems that when i stop using the sound through a program that the system takes a while to stop the sound device and then it makes a click or something ... interesting ... ha
2009-11-08T15:42:00.000Z	j1mp492	zetheroo	Okey..
2009-11-08T15:54:00.000Z	j1mp492	zetheroo	Well, as an example if the quality is 100 when i start listen on a song, then it get more and more worse the longer i listen. and soon i cant even hear the song, and its the same on all "music players"
2009-11-08T15:55:00.000Z	j1mp492	zetheroo	and sometimes does the player goes through the song in 10 sec and then take the next. Its like it is skipping the song but still go from start to end .. S:
2009-11-08T16:11:00.000Z	zetheroo	j1mp492	I have had many ATI machine with ubuntu ... overall went well
