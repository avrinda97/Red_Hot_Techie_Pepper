2011-07-04T00:59:00.000Z	centuryon		I gotta use jack for audio apps, pulscrap is messing up with the mic and things.
2011-07-04T01:00:00.000Z	centuryon		how to destroy pulseabomination so it won't show in programs as sound option?? even in system config??
2011-07-04T01:01:00.000Z	centuryon		this is a temporary workaround mv  /etc/init.d/pulseaudio /etc/init.d/pulseaudio.bak
2011-07-04T01:02:00.000Z	centuryon		but that doesnt fully delete pulse as audio option.
2011-07-04T01:02:00.000Z	centuryon		nobody knows??
2011-07-04T01:03:00.000Z	centuryon		HOW TO DISABLE PULSEAUDIO???!!!111
2011-07-04T01:04:00.000Z	centuryon		does it default to plain alsa??
2011-07-04T01:05:00.000Z	centuryon		wait a minute, so ubutnut has hardcoded everything to depend on pulse??
2011-07-04T01:05:00.000Z	centuryon		I don't get it.
2011-07-04T01:05:00.000Z	Jeruvy	centuryon	you resemble a troll
2011-07-04T01:07:00.000Z	centuryon	Jeruvy	nope, I am trying to use JACKD, you know, audio editing software DO use jackd. Now pulse is messing with the mic for instance not picking up in ardour2.
2011-07-04T01:07:00.000Z	centuryon	Jeruvy	is that trolling or a legitimate issue??
2011-07-04T01:07:00.000Z	Jeruvy	centuryon	you now state an issue, your prior comments resemble trolling
2011-07-04T01:08:00.000Z	Jeruvy	centuryon	I'd keep that in perspective in the future if I was you.
2011-07-04T01:09:00.000Z	centuryon		ok, I can live with a broken sound system as long as jack apps DO work. I don't need a system bell for instance.
2011-07-04T01:09:00.000Z	centuryon	Jeruvy	well, it was driving me nuts.
2011-07-04T01:09:00.000Z	Jeruvy	centuryon	fair enough, now back to your issue.
2011-07-04T01:10:00.000Z	centuryon	Jeruvy	I think I am straight with apt-get purge pulseaudio*
