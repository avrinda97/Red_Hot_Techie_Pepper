2007-01-17T10:04:00.000Z	wolfwalker		Can someone recommend a good audio editor for ubuntu?
2007-01-17T10:04:00.000Z	wolfwalker		Got that
2007-01-17T10:04:00.000Z	wolfwalker		Heard something about ardour
2007-01-17T10:04:00.000Z	craigbass1976	wolfwalker	I'm diggin ardour for multitrack
2007-01-17T10:04:00.000Z	wolfwalker		But I can't find it
2007-01-17T10:05:00.000Z	craigbass1976	wolfwalker	It's in one of the apt repos.  I simply did apt-get install ardour, but I don't remember what had to be enabled first.  You also need JACK
2007-01-17T10:06:00.000Z	wolfwalker	craigbass1976	 This may sound like a bad joke, but I don't know jack
2007-01-17T10:06:00.000Z	wolfwalker		!ardour
2007-01-17T10:06:00.000Z	wolfwalker		:/
2007-01-17T10:07:00.000Z	craigbass1976	wolfwalker	hehe.  It's the "Jack Audio Connectin Kit" and though I don't know much jack either, it seems to be some sort of go between for Ardour and ALSA.
2007-01-17T10:07:00.000Z	wolfwalker		Okay, so how do I get jack?
2007-01-17T10:11:00.000Z	wolfwalker		Pay tribute
2007-01-17T10:11:00.000Z	wolfwalker		lol
2007-01-17T10:12:00.000Z	wolfwalker		So how and where do I get ardour?
2007-01-17T10:13:00.000Z	wolfwalker		YAY!
2007-01-17T10:13:00.000Z	wolfwalker		I didn't know it was ardour-gtk
2007-01-17T10:13:00.000Z	wolfwalker		They just told me ardour
2007-01-17T10:13:00.000Z	wolfwalker		:/
