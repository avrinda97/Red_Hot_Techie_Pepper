2007-03-24T08:40:00.000Z	Askar		A howto for a game tells me to "Killing your window manager at this point can help out with performance,     and prevent wacky things from happening (like switching virtual   desktops)."
2007-03-24T08:40:00.000Z	Askar		How do I do that?
2007-03-24T08:41:00.000Z	atoponce	Askar	no, not what blanky said
2007-03-24T08:41:00.000Z	atoponce	Askar	you have 4 boxes in your taskbar, by default.
2007-03-24T08:41:00.000Z	atoponce	Askar	those are your virt desktops
2007-03-24T08:41:00.000Z	Askar	atoponce	yeah
2007-03-24T08:42:00.000Z	atoponce	Askar	if they're not there, 'ctrl-left' and 'ctrl-right' will switch between them
2007-03-24T08:43:00.000Z	atoponce	Askar	pardon me. i just realized what i typed
2007-03-24T08:43:00.000Z	atoponce	Askar	'ctrl-alt-right' 'ctrl-alt-left'
2007-03-24T08:43:00.000Z	atoponce	Askar	my bad. :)
2007-03-24T08:44:00.000Z	atoponce	Askar	what's the game?
2007-03-24T08:44:00.000Z	atoponce	Askar	and what are the specs of your pc?
2007-03-24T08:45:00.000Z	Askar	atoponce	I have 1, 4 ghz 512 mb ram hp laptop
2007-03-24T08:45:00.000Z	atoponce	Askar	i wouldn't kill your window manager. that's just silly.
2007-03-24T08:45:00.000Z	Askar	atoponce	shouldnt it give me more systemresources?
2007-03-24T08:46:00.000Z	atoponce	Askar	yeah, but your window manager powers your desktop, so, unless you plan on running it in the terminal...
2007-03-24T08:46:00.000Z	atoponce	Askar	then again, i'm not familiar with that game, so
2007-03-24T08:48:00.000Z	Askar	atoponce	sacater: ok thanks
2007-03-24T08:48:00.000Z	atoponce	Askar	np
