2011-09-13T06:04:00.000Z	f4k3z		another question, do we need specific codec or something for MKV playback?
2011-09-13T06:05:00.000Z	f4k3z		because i just recall installing the restricted extras
2011-09-13T06:05:00.000Z	f4k3z		and not sure if that comes with mkv codec
2011-09-13T06:06:00.000Z	f4k3z		so we dont need to install specific codecs or something(like in windows) to play mkv files properly?
2011-09-13T06:08:00.000Z	f4k3z		yeap but chooppy/laggy
2011-09-13T06:09:00.000Z	almoxarife	f4k3z	mplayer?
2011-09-13T06:09:00.000Z	f4k3z	almoxarife	it laggs as well, and sometimes closes itself
2011-09-13T06:10:00.000Z	almoxarife	f4k3z	have you considered the issue may be related to something else? hardware?
2011-09-13T06:10:00.000Z	f4k3z		the problem is that only in bntu i cannot play mkv. or hd files :(
2011-09-13T06:10:00.000Z	f4k3z		in win7 i can play all HD files and mkv properly
2011-09-13T06:11:00.000Z	f4k3z	almoxarife	if it was hardware, probably i will get same issue in win7, but only in Ubuntu i am facing it
2011-09-13T06:11:00.000Z	almoxarife	f4k3z	true
2011-09-13T06:12:00.000Z	f4k3z	almoxarife	yeap, so i am wondering if it is drivers/codec related issue not sure :(
2011-09-13T06:13:00.000Z	almoxarife	f4k3z	you have medibuntu installed?
2011-09-13T06:13:00.000Z	almoxarife	f4k3z	I don't know that it would make a diff but I have never been without it, so its hard to tell
2011-09-13T06:15:00.000Z	f4k3z	almoxarife	to be honest havent tried it
2011-09-13T06:15:00.000Z	f4k3z	almoxarife	but you have intel's graphics card?
2011-09-13T06:15:00.000Z	almoxarife	f4k3z	yeap, intel graphics on a cheaper laptop
2011-09-13T06:16:00.000Z	f4k3z	almoxarife	what card do you have?
