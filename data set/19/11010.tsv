2006-04-18T13:59:00.000Z	RazboiniK		hello i just bought a sony cyber-shot dsc-w50, but i'm not able to mount it, the usbview shows it on red but still can't mount it
2006-04-18T14:00:00.000Z	PwcrLinux	RazboiniK	You need to get a memory stick, some camera have USB plug in and doesn't show anything.. My camera have a memory card, I can plug the memory card and it's works good..
2006-04-18T14:01:00.000Z	RazboiniK		i thought it may be that. but wasn't so sure, the memory sticks comes next week :( thanks so much for the tip
2006-04-18T14:02:00.000Z	PwcrLinux	RazboiniK	if you have a sony lappy, it'll work auto detecting a memory stick on gnome desktop..
2006-04-18T14:03:00.000Z	RazboiniK	PwcrLinux	i have an old toshiba :(, although i dont have memory stick is has internal memory, wouldn't it work?
2006-04-18T14:04:00.000Z	PwcrLinux	RazboiniK	what kind of your digital camera you have now?
2006-04-18T14:04:00.000Z	RazboiniK		cybershot dsc-w50
2006-04-18T14:05:00.000Z	PwcrLinux	RazboiniK	Oh, a sony camera you can get the USB memory stick reader and buy a stick, cuz the gnome have automatically mounting a USB flash drive and memory card..
2006-04-18T14:07:00.000Z	RazboiniK	PwcrLinux	i had and old cybershot and i was able to mount it as an usb-storage, the new one on windows this worked out of the box without installing anything but on linux it doesn't, and the usbview show its there but in red
2006-04-18T14:07:00.000Z	PwcrLinux	RazboiniK	your older toshiba lappy might not work, they'r need 1.1 and above, so the linux would override to full 2.0
2006-04-18T14:09:00.000Z	PwcrLinux	RazboiniK	or you can get USB 2.0 pcimca card..
2006-04-18T14:09:00.000Z	RazboiniK		ok
2006-04-18T14:09:00.000Z	RazboiniK		will try it that way then

2006-04-18T14:11:00.000Z	PwcrLinux	RazboiniK	aha! that's good, it's override to full 2.0
2006-04-18T14:11:00.000Z	RazboiniK	PwcrLinux	anyway i can change it?
2006-04-18T14:14:00.000Z	PwcrLinux	RazboiniK	grab a USB memory stick reader and memory stick, put your memory stick into camera and take a pics and when you're done and pull the stick out of camera, and plug the stick into USB memory reader, it'll auto detecting and auto start gthumb program to see a pics on your memory card.
