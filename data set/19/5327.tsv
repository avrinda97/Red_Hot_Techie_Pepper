2009-10-12T07:22:00.000Z	evon		Here's my issue.  I have linux on hd0,0 and windows on h0,2.  When linux loads it hangs after splash and windows just gives me an error about bootmgr orsomething
2009-10-12T07:22:00.000Z	evon		please help
2009-10-12T07:22:00.000Z	redlance	evon	Can you reboot it and give us the actual windows error?
2009-10-12T07:23:00.000Z	evon	redlance	sure
2009-10-12T07:25:00.000Z	evon	redlance	it says bootmgr is missing
2009-10-12T07:26:00.000Z	redlance	evon	Which version of Windows?
2009-10-12T07:26:00.000Z	evon	redlance	xp
2009-10-12T07:27:00.000Z	evon	redlance	any ideas?
2009-10-12T07:27:00.000Z	redlance	evon	I'm looking...
2009-10-12T07:28:00.000Z	redlance	evon	Do you have your Windows install CD?
2009-10-12T07:28:00.000Z	evon	redlance	yes
2009-10-12T07:29:00.000Z	redlance	evon	Ok, try this link: http://www.computerforum.com/15602-bootmgr-missing-help.html
2009-10-12T07:29:00.000Z	redlance	evon	Follow the steps in the second post
2009-10-12T08:03:00.000Z	evon	redlance	now it says ntldr missing
2009-10-12T08:03:00.000Z	evon	redlance	grub is also saying it is an unknown partition
2009-10-12T08:04:00.000Z	redlance	evon	Grub says the Windows partition is unknown?
2009-10-12T08:06:00.000Z	evon	redlance	it says "root (h0,2), filesystem type unknown partition type 0x7, makeactive, chainloader +1"
2009-10-12T08:06:00.000Z	evon	redlance	then it says ntldr missing
2009-10-12T08:08:00.000Z	redlance	evon	Hmmm...sounds like your Master Boot Record is messed up...Google for "ntldr missing xp" and you'll find several sites with suggestions...As far as the Linux side, you will probably have to reinstall grub.
