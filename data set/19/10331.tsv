2007-01-26T12:44:00.000Z	cablesm102	JohnnyX_	is this only on Ubuntu? Because I think it's a hardware problem, which means you need to take it somewhere else.
2007-01-26T12:45:00.000Z	cablesm102	JohnnyX_	do you have another OS on your system?
2007-01-26T12:46:00.000Z	cablesm102	JohnnyX_	so how can you be sure it's Ubuntu?
2007-01-26T12:47:00.000Z	cablesm102	JohnnyX_	did it ever work on Ubuntu?
2007-01-26T12:47:00.000Z	cablesm102	JohnnyX_	if it worked on Ubuntu at some point it means it's a hardware issue.
2007-01-26T12:48:00.000Z	cablesm102	JohnnyX_	try one of those cleaning disks, try rebooting your computer, and try smacking the case. If it's still broken, get another CD ROM drive.
2007-01-26T12:48:00.000Z	cablesm102	JohnnyX_	sure they do
2007-01-26T12:49:00.000Z	cablesm102	JohnnyX_	there's no way to prove it's Ubuntu. It sounds like a hardware issue. If WIndows was on your machine right now, I'm sure it would be broken there too.
2007-01-26T12:53:00.000Z	cablesm102	JohnnyX_	you need to use something like AIGLX and Beryl. Very beta
2007-01-26T12:53:00.000Z	cablesm102	JohnnyX_	just look it up on wiki.ubuntu.com. Beryl does a lot of other cool stuff too
2007-01-26T12:57:00.000Z	cablesm102	JohnnyX_	there's Feisty, which is in developement.
2007-01-26T13:02:00.000Z	cablesm102	JohnnyX_	it's HARDWARE.
2007-01-26T13:03:00.000Z	cablesm102	JohnnyX_	you tried this after it stopped working?
2007-01-26T13:04:00.000Z	cablesm102	JohnnyX_	sorry about doubting you. I didn't know you tried it on another comp.
2007-01-26T13:07:00.000Z	cablesm102	JohnnyX_	what color is it?
