2008-05-31T14:29:00.000Z	Cipry007		hy ,i just installed latest ubuntu version its working fine but i dont know how to change the resolution ... can some1 help me pls?
2008-05-31T14:29:00.000Z	babolat	Cipry007	you probably need the non-ree drivers installed for your graphics card
2008-05-31T14:32:00.000Z	Cipry007	babolat	i see on "device driver" nvidia new and a checkbox that is checkt under enable but the status is "not in use"
2008-05-31T14:32:00.000Z	babolat	Cipry007	you need to put it in use evidently. is there an option for that?
2008-05-31T14:34:00.000Z	babolat	Cipry007	try to uncheck it, then check it again
2008-05-31T14:34:00.000Z	Cipry007	babolat	done and it says need computer restart ... i will restart my computer and then i will be back
2008-05-31T14:37:00.000Z	Cipry007	babolat	nothing ... its still the same message on that status : "not in use"
2008-05-31T14:38:00.000Z	babolat	Cipry007	ok
2008-05-31T14:38:00.000Z	babolat	Cipry007	is medibuntu.org repo enabled in System > Admin > Software Sources?
2008-05-31T14:40:00.000Z	Cipry007	babolat	the website ... i cant find it on any option from software sources
2008-05-31T14:41:00.000Z	babolat	Cipry007	sudo wget http://www.medibuntu.org/sources.list.d/hardy.list -O /etc/apt/sources.list.d/medibuntu.list
2008-05-31T14:43:00.000Z	babolat	Cipry007	then after that, add the pgp key by doing: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install medibuntu-keyring && sudo apt-get update
2008-05-31T14:44:00.000Z	Cipry007	babolat	: done
2008-05-31T14:45:00.000Z	Cipry007	babolat	i did all you sayd he installed alot of things...now what?
2008-05-31T14:45:00.000Z	babolat	Cipry007	^
2008-05-31T15:16:00.000Z	Cipry007	babolat	i installed all those things but i still cant change my resolution my graphic card is in use not
2008-05-31T15:18:00.000Z	babolat	Cipry007	ok
2008-05-31T15:19:00.000Z	babolat	Cipry007	your best bet now is probably use envy if you have nVidia or ATI
2008-05-31T15:19:00.000Z	Cipry007	babolat	i have nVidia
