2008-06-23T11:26:00.000Z	laurentiu		I have Ati RAdeon 9200 <-- but driver ??? :| how i Install the driver for linux ??
2008-06-23T11:27:00.000Z	saint-takeshi	laurentiu	use the open driver for that
2008-06-23T11:28:00.000Z	saint-takeshi	laurentiu	you don't need the proprietary driver, you'll get better results using the open source "ati" one
2008-06-23T11:29:00.000Z	saint-takeshi	laurentiu	alt+F2, then type gksu gedit /etc/xorg.conf
2008-06-23T11:30:00.000Z	saint-takeshi	laurentiu	what is it you're trying to do?
2008-06-23T11:31:00.000Z	saint-takeshi	laurentiu	open a terminal and type glxgears
2008-06-23T11:32:00.000Z	saint-takeshi	laurentiu	and let me know what kind of FPS values you get.
2008-06-23T11:34:00.000Z	saint-takeshi	laurentiu	water effect and rain?
2008-06-23T11:35:00.000Z	saint-takeshi	laurentiu	desktop-effects? or in a game?
2008-06-23T11:37:00.000Z	saint-takeshi	laurentiu	hmmm....i didn't know you could get water and rain effects...then again, i didn't know you could get 1100+fps out of a radeon 9200...that's the same chipset as the one i just gave away....did you do anything to driconf, or did it do that "out of the box" so to speak?
