2005-08-02T16:45:00.000Z	cafuego	firemanworld	Just install the ubuntu package and not the Debian one.
2005-08-02T16:46:00.000Z	cafuego	firemanworld	Check the wiki url ubotu just posted; it explains.
2005-08-02T16:48:00.000Z	cafuego	firemanworld	Your problem is with java.
2005-08-02T16:48:00.000Z	cafuego	firemanworld	You're installing a *debian( java which hads *debian* depends. Not Ubuntu ones.
2005-08-02T16:49:00.000Z	cafuego	firemanworld	Then you have a fairly broken sources.list with non-ubuntu repositories.
2005-08-02T16:49:00.000Z	cafuego	firemanworld	Mixing pckages is a bad idea at best and will destroy the system at worst.
2005-08-02T16:50:00.000Z	cafuego	firemanworld	No, use the pastebot.
2005-08-02T16:55:00.000Z	cafuego	firemanworld	Comment out the marillar lines
2005-08-02T16:56:00.000Z	cafuego	firemanworld	d'oh :-)
2005-08-02T16:57:00.000Z	cafuego	firemanworld	In that case, you'll need to go to java.sun.com and download the j2se_1.5.04-*.bin (whatever the latest version is) - NOT the .bin.rpm, but the .bin.
2005-08-02T16:58:00.000Z	cafuego	firemanworld	Also install 'java-package'.
2005-08-02T05:05:00.000Z	cafuego	firemanworld	That way yopu'll get the latest. Once downloaded, you can run 'make-jpkg j2dsk.....bin', which will create a .deb for you.
