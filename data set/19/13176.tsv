2005-07-20T14:21:00.000Z	hondje		sudo mount /dev/hda1 /mnt doesn't work?
2005-07-20T14:21:00.000Z	hondje		okay, you didn't say you tried to mount it, just that it's not in /dev
2005-07-20T14:21:00.000Z	hondje		so, let's see...fdisk sees it, /dev dont
2005-07-20T14:23:00.000Z	hondje		well, at least you know you're not crazy :)
2005-07-20T14:23:00.000Z	Determinist	hondje	notice tho that fdisk -l shows hda1 and hda2 as SFS system
2005-07-20T14:19:00.000Z	hondje	Determinist	you do. what command did you use to mount it?
2005-07-20T14:19:00.000Z	Determinist	hondje	mate , you cant mount something that isnt in /dev/ and hda1 or hda2 are simply not there
2005-07-20T14:20:00.000Z	hondje	Determinist	didn't fdisk -l just show them?
2005-07-20T14:20:00.000Z	Determinist	hondje	it did, which puzzles me.
2005-07-20T14:20:00.000Z	hondje	Determinist	maybe it's a udev thing
2005-07-20T14:21:00.000Z	Determinist	hondje	"ls /dev/ | grep hda" gives me only /dev/hda
2005-07-20T14:21:00.000Z	Determinist	hondje	ok , so suppose it is , what am i to do about this? paint my puter blue and toss it into the ocean? lol
2005-07-20T14:21:00.000Z	Determinist	hondje	no lol
2005-07-20T14:22:00.000Z	hondje	Determinist	that just doesn't make sense
2005-07-20T14:23:00.000Z	Determinist	hondje	i agree
2005-07-20T14:24:00.000Z	Determinist	hondje	that ... i do not know
2005-07-20T14:29:00.000Z	hondje	Determinist	having dug out the giant book o' fdisk I have determined that I have no clue :)
2005-07-20T14:30:00.000Z	Determinist	hondje	lol , thanks anyways mate
2005-07-20T14:30:00.000Z	hondje	Determinist	only thing I can think of is to reboot and see if you find anything interesting in dmesg about hda or hal
