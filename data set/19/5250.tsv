2008-11-10T00:11:00.000Z	Oprtz		i am  using wicd Network Manager, can i use 3g internet on this Network Manager?
2008-11-10T00:12:00.000Z	billybigrigger	Oprtz	are you using ubuntu 8.10
2008-11-10T00:12:00.000Z	Oprtz	billybigrigger	 yes 8.10
2008-11-10T00:12:00.000Z	billybigrigger	Oprtz	the network-manager in intrepid has 3g support yes, and my 3g usb modem worked out of the box
2008-11-10T00:13:00.000Z	Oprtz	billybigrigger	as i already said, i am not using the default Network Manaer of 8.10, i am using Wicd network manager
2008-11-10T00:15:00.000Z	billybigrigger	Oprtz	well then maybe you should ask in wicd's forums or irc chan
2008-11-10T00:15:00.000Z	Oprtz	billybigrigger	 whats the channel name dude ?
2008-11-10T00:16:00.000Z	billybigrigger	Oprtz	http://wicd.sourceforge.net/
2008-11-10T00:16:00.000Z	billybigrigger	Oprtz	may i ask why your not using ubuntu's NM???
2008-11-10T00:16:00.000Z	Oprtz	billybigrigger	 i remove that by mistake :(
2008-11-10T00:16:00.000Z	billybigrigger	Oprtz	well then sudo apt-get install network-manager
2008-11-10T00:17:00.000Z	Oprtz	billybigrigger	 the 2 network managers will start fighting each other :)
2008-11-10T00:17:00.000Z	billybigrigger	Oprtz	using a package that isn't included with ubuntu, and coming here for support is a no no...hehe
2008-11-10T00:17:00.000Z	billybigrigger	Oprtz	not saying no one will help you but....
2008-11-10T00:18:00.000Z	billybigrigger	Oprtz	well then ask around wicd's support channels either forums or irc
2008-11-10T00:18:00.000Z	Oprtz	billybigrigger	 ahhhh :( but wicd is not a ubuntu package?
2008-11-10T00:18:00.000Z	billybigrigger	Oprtz	nope
2008-11-10T00:18:00.000Z	Oprtz	billybigrigger	 is it Debian aproach then ?
2008-11-10T01:13:00.000Z	Oprtz	billybigrigger	 remove wicd and install network-manager 0.7, my internet works fine but the icon is not showing on the panel . what to do ? thanks
