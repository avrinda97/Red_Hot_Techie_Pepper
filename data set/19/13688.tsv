2007-06-11T09:23:00.000Z	Dr_willis	MacDrunk_	 theres other samba configuration utilities out now besides swat. You may want to try them. Ive not messed with swat in ages. The swat configs May in fact have swat disabled by default untill you edit them.
2007-06-11T09:30:00.000Z	Dr_willis	MacDrunk_	 yes...
2007-06-11T09:42:00.000Z	Dr_willis	MacDrunk_	 i just got swat working. :)
2007-06-11T09:42:00.000Z	Dr_willis	MacDrunk_	 i know kde has a samba config tool.. of course theres editing the smb.conf by hand.
2007-06-11T09:43:00.000Z	Dr_willis	MacDrunk_	 also saw that swat just totally rewrote my smb.conf for me..  got rid of all my comments and so forth.
2007-06-11T09:44:00.000Z	Dr_willis	MacDrunk_	 i instgalled it with ------>  sudo apt-get install swat netkit-inetd tcpd
2007-06-11T09:45:00.000Z	Dr_willis	MacDrunk_	 it wouldent WORK untill i isntalled tcpd. :)
2007-06-11T09:45:00.000Z	Dr_willis	MacDrunk_	 also some of the how to's i read say you need to create a root password. (wich is considred a bad idea in ubuntu-land)
2007-06-11T09:46:00.000Z	Dr_willis	MacDrunk_	 http://www.go2linux.org/node/98   was one of the sites i read.
