2007-12-24T19:21:00.000Z	foo25		Hey guys, would adding "sleep 10 & kiba-dock" to /etc/rc.local work by delaying it's startup by 10 seconds?
2007-12-24T19:21:00.000Z	Pici	foo25	no, because rc.local is for services.  you need to add it to your desktop environment startup
2007-12-24T19:59:00.000Z	Pici	foo25	Thats about the vaugest question I have ever heard.
2007-12-24T19:59:00.000Z	Pici	foo25	Ah, sorry /me looks
2007-12-24T19:59:00.000Z	foo25	Pici	lol, it's fine =P
2007-12-24T20:00:00.000Z	Pici	foo25	Does iwconfig list your adapter?
2007-12-24T20:00:00.000Z	foo25	Pici	Yeah, it does
2007-12-24T20:01:00.000Z	Pici	foo25	Where do you get problems?
2007-12-24T20:01:00.000Z	foo25	Pici	Honestly I'm not sure, I was just using Firefox, and trying to get Devilspie working, then I noticed no pages would load, so I restarted, and it seemed no wireless networks could be found
2007-12-24T20:03:00.000Z	Pici	foo25	Do you have an icon in the upper left corner of the screen near the clock (if your panels are still at the defaults) that looks like 2 computers?
2007-12-24T20:04:00.000Z	foo25	Pici	I did until I uninstalled Network Manager to use Wicd in the hope it'd work, I've reinstalled Network Manager, I'm just searching for the command to start it up =P
2007-12-24T20:10:00.000Z	foo25	Pici	I've got network-manager running again if that's any help
2007-12-24T20:10:00.000Z	Pici	foo25	Okay, and see if you can configure your card in that now.
2007-12-24T20:11:00.000Z	foo25	Pici	Normally it'd display the networks it could find, but apparently none exist now, that's what I'm finding strange
2007-12-24T20:15:00.000Z	foo25	Pici	I've even tried manual settings, but it's not even picking up my wireless network, however I know the network is fine because I'm currently using it on this PC
2007-12-24T21:59:00.000Z	foo25	Pici	70% reinstalled =P
2007-12-24T22:19:00.000Z	foo25	Pici	A simple reinstallation and my wireless card is working perfectly =P
2007-12-24T22:19:00.000Z	Pici	foo25	great to hear/
2007-12-24T22:20:00.000Z	foo25	Pici	I know =D I think I'll do the updates over night perhaps, thanks for the help
