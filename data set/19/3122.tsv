2009-10-23T22:02:00.000Z	houn_		So, the mpd that ships with Jaunty does not have pulse support built in, I take it?
2009-10-23T22:03:00.000Z	houn_		Wait, let me correct my typo, lol
2009-10-23T22:03:00.000Z	houn_		Disregard.  PEBKAC
2009-10-23T22:03:00.000Z	houn_		mpd still works.
2009-10-23T22:04:00.000Z	houn_		Still nothing in Flash.
2009-10-23T22:06:00.000Z	houn_		Bah.
2009-10-23T22:06:00.000Z	houn_		Ok, evidently NOTHING has audio except for mpd
2009-10-23T22:06:00.000Z	houn_		Even with mpd stopped
2009-10-23T22:06:00.000Z	boknoy	houn_	to get audio back, kill mpd
2009-10-23T22:06:00.000Z	houn_	boknoy	I stopped the daemon.
2009-10-23T22:07:00.000Z	boknoy		what about the mpd client?
2009-10-23T22:07:00.000Z	houn_	boknoy	Or is an actual kill needed?
2009-10-23T22:07:00.000Z	boknoy		not stop as in stop audio playing, but stop as in the process ceases to exist.
2009-10-23T22:07:00.000Z	houn_	boknoy	/etc/init.d/mpd stop
2009-10-23T22:07:00.000Z	houn_		Yeah, I know what you meant. ;)
2009-10-23T22:08:00.000Z	boknoy	houn_	haha maybe it still hasn't released the sound card
2009-10-23T22:09:00.000Z	houn_	boknoy	any way to force a release?
2009-10-23T22:10:00.000Z	houn_		Also, this is kinda lame.
2009-10-23T22:10:00.000Z	boknoy	houn_	sorry, I don't know why it still hasn't even done it after killing mpd
