2005-10-26T13:33:00.000Z	Sirrush	juliana	 I'd say try Horary 5.04 as Breezy did not prompt me where it wanted grub installed

2005-10-26T13:37:00.000Z	juliana	Sirrush	I haven't played around with linux for several years and don't remember much except that I ultimately screwed up mom's mbr.  If I installed that-- would I just do so to the partition I have set aside?  And then would formatting that partition cause it to use the windows bootloader again?
2005-10-26T13:37:00.000Z	Sirrush		lol juliana  I've been their
2005-10-26T13:38:00.000Z	Sirrush		You can always use the windows CD to fix the mbr

2005-10-26T13:45:00.000Z	Sirrush	juliana	 not even recovery CD's?
2005-10-26T13:45:00.000Z	juliana		How about installing ubuntu to an external USB hd?  Would that be more trouble than it's worth?
2005-10-26T13:46:00.000Z	juliana		I wish I could just wipe the mofo clean and forget windows, but unfortunately it's not an option...
2005-10-26T13:47:00.000Z	Sirrush		Yeah that would not be a good idea
2005-10-26T13:47:00.000Z	Sirrush		external USB would work I had a guy who installed to it at college so I know it works
2005-10-26T13:47:00.000Z	Sirrush	juliana	 will you use breezy?
2005-10-26T13:48:00.000Z	juliana	Sirrush	I don't know what breezy is
