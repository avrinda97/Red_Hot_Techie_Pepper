2005-07-22T08:42:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	sebastian	it is a hack to make gimp look like photoshop
2005-07-22T08:43:00.000Z	sebastian	hybrid_goth	How good of a hack, will it have the same icons and windows behaviour too?
2005-07-22T08:44:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	sebastian	idk never used it try plasticbugs.com for more
2005-07-22T09:01:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	sebastian	when the release is final it gets no new packages
2005-07-22T09:02:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	sebastian	hoary is final. but backports let you get some newer things
2005-07-22T09:02:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	sebastian	but developement gets most the newest packages thats why breezy has a X bug
2005-07-22T09:03:00.000Z	sebastian	hybrid_goth	Hmm, can't you just get the latest stable pakage of every software?
2005-07-22T09:04:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	sebastian	yes you get stable packages or whatever packages worked when the released was issued
2005-07-22T09:05:00.000Z	sebastian	hybrid_goth	Isn't Firefox 1.0.4 stable?
2005-07-22T09:05:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	sebastian	if you want ALL the newest packages and can report bugs and go about helping fixing then the developement branch works but if any of those dont imply forget it
2005-07-22T09:06:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	sebastian	ubuntu edits firefox so the patches in .4 may have been taken care of in .2 ubuntu
2005-07-22T09:06:00.000Z	sebastian	hybrid_goth	I don't get it, can't I just have the latest, stable versions of every software? Like I do in Windows or Mac OS X?
2005-07-22T09:07:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	sebastian	this is way different
2005-07-22T09:07:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	sebastian	you have what WORKED when it was released not what is "stable" and stable is not the way to be b/c stable to us is diff the debian stable
2005-07-22T09:08:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	sebastian	if you get it from mozilla then it may not be the best when you upgrade
2005-07-22T09:08:00.000Z	sebastian	hybrid_goth	What I mean by stable is that those realeasing the software consider it appropriate for use.
2005-07-22T09:09:00.000Z	sebastian	hybrid_goth	Well, as it's not possible to get extensions for 1.0.2 I don't have any choice do I?
2005-07-22T09:09:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	sebastian	ok if it is stable after the release then it would be in the next issue
