2009-05-02T10:16:00.000Z	fde		Isn't 7.10 EOL?
2009-05-02T10:16:00.000Z	fde		!7.10
2009-05-02T10:17:00.000Z	fde		Yes, yes it is... no wonder the archives for it are empty.
2009-05-02T10:17:00.000Z	kinabalu	fde	ouch.  is the upgrade going to suck?  these are live servers
2009-05-02T10:17:00.000Z	fde	kinabalu	upgrade to hardy... ONLY use LTS releases for servers
2009-05-02T10:18:00.000Z	kinabalu	fde	is there a simple upgrade path?  i have site backups ... its on a slicehost, which I believe was the option at the time
2009-05-02T10:20:00.000Z	fde	kinabalu	sudo sed -i s/gutsy/hardy/ /etc/apt/sources.list && sudo aptitude update && sudo aptitude full-upgrade and cross your fingers  :/
2009-05-02T10:20:00.000Z	kinabalu	fde	heh.  sounds scary.  i have a backup image of the box ... so not *too* scary :)
2009-05-02T10:21:00.000Z	fde	kinabalu	you're just editing /etc/apt/sources.list to change all cases of gutsy to hardy, updating the repos, and upgrading the software... not scary at all
2009-05-02T10:22:00.000Z	kinabalu	fde	yeah, so 8.04 is what i want basically, yes?
2009-05-02T10:22:00.000Z	fde	kinabalu	yes
2009-05-02T10:53:00.000Z	fde	kinabalu	use visudo
2009-05-02T10:54:00.000Z	kinabalu	fde	aight.  and add the user to an admin group?
2009-05-02T10:54:00.000Z	fde	kinabalu	you can, sure...
2009-05-02T10:55:00.000Z	kinabalu	fde	w00t!  upgrade to hardy was EASY
2009-05-02T10:56:00.000Z	fde	kinabalu	:)  in the future, always upgrade to LTS releases on that server... just ensure you don't use the first release... for instance, hardy is currently at 8.04.2 I think... you always want to start at .1
2009-05-02T10:56:00.000Z	kinabalu	fde	ahh, so its like apple hardware, never by the first rev
2009-05-02T10:57:00.000Z	fde	kinabalu	sort of... its just the first version of an LTS is no more stable than a normal release, which isn't suitable for a server
2009-05-02T10:57:00.000Z	kinabalu	fde	indeed.
