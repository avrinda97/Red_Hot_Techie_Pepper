2011-01-03T06:35:00.000Z	KM0201		MJ94: pretty sure quassel has an ubuntu version
2011-01-03T06:35:00.000Z	KM0201		!info quassel | MJ94
2011-01-03T06:36:00.000Z	KM0201		MJ94: sudo apt-get install quassel    that should do it.
2011-01-03T06:36:00.000Z	MJ94_	KM0201	I've seen that, but I don't know what it means.
2011-01-03T06:37:00.000Z	MJ94_	KM0201	I did that right before you typed it. Thanks. ;)
2011-01-03T06:37:00.000Z	KM0201	MJ94_	no prob... are you using Ubuntu or Kubuntu?
2011-01-03T06:38:00.000Z	MJ94_	KM0201	The former.
2011-01-03T06:38:00.000Z	KM0201	MJ94_	system/admin/synaptic package manager... is an easy to use GUI tool, you can search it for packages using the search feature
2011-01-03T06:38:00.000Z	MJ94_	KM0201	Thanks!
2011-01-03T06:38:00.000Z	KM0201	MJ94_	no prob
2011-01-03T06:39:00.000Z	KM0201	MJ94_	and in case it wasn't clear... you can also use synaptic to install packages w/ a few clicks (synaptic is basically a GUI front for apt-get)
2011-01-03T06:40:00.000Z	MJ94_	KM0201	Thank you. :)
2011-01-03T06:40:00.000Z	MJ94_	KM0201	/me watches in awe ;)
2011-01-03T06:41:00.000Z	KM0201	MJ94_	only thing is, Quassel is a KDE app, it's gonna require a ton of KDE dependencies(not a big deal in the whole scheme of things)... xchat is another popular IRC client for linux.
2011-01-03T06:43:00.000Z	MJ94_	KM0201	I wanted just the client, not the monolithic client. :)
2011-01-03T06:43:00.000Z	KM0201	MJ94_	i'm not really sure what you just said.
2011-01-03T06:43:00.000Z	MJ94_	KM0201	PM?
2011-01-03T06:44:00.000Z	KM0201	MJ94_	everything you just installed, is required to install/run quassel
2011-01-03T06:44:00.000Z	KM0201	MJ94_	sure if you want
