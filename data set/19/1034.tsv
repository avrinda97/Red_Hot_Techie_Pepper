2011-06-04T10:05:00.000Z	Jordan_U	zorphon	Open the video in totem and it should prompt you to install the needed audio codec.
2011-06-04T10:07:00.000Z	zorphon	Jordan_U	where do I find totem? I just installed Ubuntu for the first time like an hour ago, excuse my noobiness
2011-06-04T10:08:00.000Z	Jordan_U	zorphon	It's the actual name of "Movie Player" which is installed by default.
2011-06-04T10:08:00.000Z	zorphon	Jordan_U	actually.. I did, that's why it prompted me to install the h.264 decoder, I did that but it only has the video. It gave no suggestions on other codecs
2011-06-04T10:09:00.000Z	Jordan_U	zorphon	I assume other audio does play?
2011-06-04T10:10:00.000Z	Jordan_U	zorphon	What audo codec does VLC say the video uses?
2011-06-04T10:10:00.000Z	zorphon	Jordan_U	where can I find that?
2011-06-04T10:12:00.000Z	Jordan_U	zorphon	Tools > Codec Information.
2011-06-04T10:14:00.000Z	zorphon	Jordan_U	audio is MPEG AAC audio, Stereo, 44100 Hz
2011-06-04T10:20:00.000Z	zorphon	Jordan_U	so what can I do?
2011-06-04T10:23:00.000Z	Jordan_U	zorphon	What happens when you try to open this sample aac audio file in totem http://www.nch.com.au/acm/sample.aac ?
2011-06-04T10:24:00.000Z	zorphon	Jordan_U	how do I open it in totem? It works fine in the browser, if that matters at all
2011-06-04T10:25:00.000Z	Jordan_U	zorphon	Download it and open it in "Movie Player". To do it in the terminal would be "cd /tmp/ && wget http://www.nch.com.au/acm/sample.aac && totem sample.aac"
2011-06-04T10:27:00.000Z	zorphon	Jordan_U	I put that in the terminal and nothing happens. Where would it save to?
2011-06-04T10:29:00.000Z	Jordan_U	zorphon	/tmp/
2011-06-04T10:29:00.000Z	Jordan_U	zorphon	There was no output at all from the commands I gave?
2011-06-04T10:32:00.000Z	zorphon	Jordan_U	it's not doing anything. Hmm...
