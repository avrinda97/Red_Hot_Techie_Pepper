2009-12-11T21:35:00.000Z	bhuvi		lm_sensors does not report fan speed in my ubuntu 9.10 but it worked fine in my ubuntu 8.04
2009-12-11T21:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_	bhuvi	 thats weird.  Not sure what to say other then check for bug reports on it.
2009-12-11T21:37:00.000Z	bhuvi	Dr_Willis_	k ill check for it
2009-12-11T21:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_	bhuvi	 lm-sensors reads info from the kernel stuff.. so im not sure how that would vanish. It could be theres some moduiles that need tobe loaded. You did run the 'sensors-detect' command ?
2009-12-11T21:38:00.000Z	bhuvi	Dr_Willis_	k ill check for it
2009-12-11T21:38:00.000Z	bhuvi	Dr_Willis_	sorry i double posted
2009-12-11T21:39:00.000Z	bhuvi	Dr_Willis_	i ran it, it checks for a long time like never before and i added the modules it reported
2009-12-11T21:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_	bhuvi	 you did reboot afterwards? (proberly not needed, but worth a test)
2009-12-11T21:41:00.000Z	bhuvi	Dr_Willis_	s i had done it right after installing it a week ago or so
2009-12-11T21:42:00.000Z	bhuvi	Dr_Willis_	sometimes i also get acpi resource conflict during boot
2009-12-11T21:42:00.000Z	bhuvi	Dr_Willis_	sometimes i also get acpi resource conflict message during boot
2009-12-11T21:52:00.000Z	bhuvi	Dr_Willis_	if i report a bug on it,which package i should report against can u help me?
2009-12-11T21:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_	bhuvi	 id say start with lm-sensors - they may be able t point it to a better place.
2009-12-11T21:53:00.000Z	bhuvi	Dr_Willis_	it was made impossible to report a bug without a package name
2009-12-11T21:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_	bhuvi	 report it on lm-sensors if the 'sensors' output is not showing the proper info i guess
2009-12-11T21:55:00.000Z	bhuvi	Dr_Willis_	when i try against with lm_sensors it says they are not using launchpad and they are asking help from me what should i do
2009-12-11T21:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_	bhuvi	 no idea then.   check the lm_sensors web site i guess
2009-12-11T21:58:00.000Z	bhuvi	Dr_Willis_	i tried reporting bug a week ago and got angry and i stopped trying because if i tried reporting against acpi i got same message and i also tried others related to it but with no success
2009-12-11T22:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_	bhuvi	 ive not reported a bug since beta. and even then.. all i really did was confirm other peoples bugs.
