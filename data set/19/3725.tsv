2010-11-25T02:58:00.000Z	someuser		anyone knowing ecryptfs quite good? :)
2010-11-25T02:58:00.000Z	someuser		i changed my password with passwd and now my home is broken
2010-11-25T02:59:00.000Z	edbian	someuser	Are you still you?
2010-11-25T02:59:00.000Z	edbian	someuser	type whoami
2010-11-25T02:59:00.000Z	edbian	someuser	ha ha ha :)
2010-11-25T02:59:00.000Z	edbian	someuser	What are the permissions on your home?
2010-11-25T03:00:00.000Z	edbian	someuser	k
2010-11-25T03:00:00.000Z	edbian	someuser	Try booting using the recovery mode.  It will let you log in without complaining about your /home
2010-11-25T03:02:00.000Z	edbian	someuser	just figure the permissions on home.  I don't care how you do it
2010-11-25T03:02:00.000Z	edbian	someuser	I don't know what happened
2010-11-25T03:03:00.000Z	edbian	someuser	mmm, and you're you (or so you claim)
2010-11-25T03:03:00.000Z	edbian	someuser	What is the error exactly?
2010-11-25T03:04:00.000Z	edbian	someuser	oh, look at your keyring?  (can you)?
2010-11-25T03:05:00.000Z	someuser	edbian	how can i access the keyring?
2010-11-25T03:05:00.000Z	edbian	someuser	Perhaps you can change your password back?
2010-11-25T03:06:00.000Z	edbian	someuser	it's a graphical app.  I'm not sure the term command for it
2010-11-25T03:06:00.000Z	someuser	edbian	of course i did that. but this did not solve the problem
2010-11-25T03:14:00.000Z	edbian	someuser	you set things up so that it is pretty much impossible too :(
