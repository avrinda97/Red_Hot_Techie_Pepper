2009-03-26T12:13:00.000Z	glick		most important software is written in english
2009-03-26T12:13:00.000Z	glick		so if you want to work with most code, you should learn english
2009-03-26T12:13:00.000Z	glick		and the languages themselves are in english
2009-03-26T12:13:00.000Z	glick		i.e. the keywords
2009-03-26T12:15:00.000Z	glick		wow kde 4 really looks niiice
2009-03-26T12:16:00.000Z	glick		kde is nice but i think its less stable then gnome
2009-03-26T12:18:00.000Z	glick		a bug to me
2009-03-26T12:20:00.000Z	glick		oh god not vs 2008
2009-03-26T12:21:00.000Z	glick		i use that at work and i hate it
2009-03-26T12:21:00.000Z	glick		but i use it for c# which is a language that i hate even more
2009-03-26T12:21:00.000Z	hans-rudolf	glick	What do you hate about c#?
2009-03-26T12:22:00.000Z	glick	hans-rudolf	i find it confusing, no includes, etc, its very hard to just look at code to know whats going on you NEED to use a IDE which keeps track of things for you
2009-03-26T12:24:00.000Z	hans-rudolf	glick	Writing include directives is just extra work, you can import namspaces. What wrong with that?
2009-03-26T12:25:00.000Z	glick	hans-rudolf	with namespaces sometimes spanning multiple files and all its just ugly and hard to follow without an IDE
2009-03-26T12:26:00.000Z	hans-rudolf	glick	I don't follow your point but ok...
2009-03-26T12:27:00.000Z	glick	hans-rudolf	i just think c# can be confusing sometimes
2009-03-26T12:27:00.000Z	hans-rudolf	glick	What about java? They are pretty similar.
2009-03-26T12:28:00.000Z	glick	hans-rudolf	one cool thing about java is that namespace correspond to actual directories
2009-03-26T12:31:00.000Z	hans-rudolf	glick	That is nice but I will just read the documentation I think. I haven't had any experience trying to setup a working  directory without an ide but I'm sure that it's a one time read of how to do it.
