2004-12-06T11:00:00.000Z	aim1159		hi all
2004-12-06T11:00:00.000Z	aim1159		are there any russians here?
2004-12-06T11:02:00.000Z	aim1159		it's ugly!
2004-12-06T11:02:00.000Z	aim1159		for some reason the locale set default to iso-8859-5
2004-12-06T11:02:00.000Z	aim1159		but the default russian in all unixes is koi8-r
2004-12-06T11:02:00.000Z	aim1159		then... X-Chat does not have support of koi8-r
2004-12-06T11:03:00.000Z	aim1159		only window$-1251
2004-12-06T11:05:00.000Z	aim1159		and don't have a utf-8 locales at all
2004-12-06T11:06:00.000Z	rapha	aim1159	If I right remember, Ubuntu wanted to fully switch to UTF-8 beginning with Hoary
2004-12-06T11:07:00.000Z	aim1159	rapha	whell... at least it should have both utf-8 and koi8-r locales for russian language selected since MANY russians use koi8-r on unixes
2004-12-06T11:08:00.000Z	rapha	aim1159	"many russians use" doesn't sound as if _those_ russians are novice computer users.
2004-12-06T11:08:00.000Z	aim1159	rapha	whell... all russians use koi8-r at IRC. or win-1251.
2004-12-06T11:09:00.000Z	aim1159	rapha	ir's just a default.
2004-12-06T11:09:00.000Z	rapha	aim1159	So why would UTF-8 not work as a default? housetier and I have set our charsets to UTF-8 and we can exchange cyrillic characters just fine.
2004-12-06T11:11:00.000Z	aim1159	rapha	I know this. but all documentation for unixes in russian is point to use koi8-r. and the novice read those docs. at least the must be a faq notice for russians to make 'dpkg-reconfigure locales' after install to add koi8-r support
2004-12-06T11:12:00.000Z	rapha	aim1159	I just checked and I do have KOI8-R in xchat.
2004-12-06T11:13:00.000Z	aim1159	rapha	do you have koi8-r locale set up?
2004-12-06T11:15:00.000Z	rapha	aim1159	No, I'm on en_US on this machine and on de_DE on my laptop.
2004-12-06T11:17:00.000Z	rapha	aim1159	there's even a russian localization package for OpenOffice in Synaptic.
