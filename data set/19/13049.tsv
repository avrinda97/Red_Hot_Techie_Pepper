2005-07-27T16:39:00.000Z	othernoob	kbrooks	 Rugmonster: because you will break your system (sooner or) later  <<why
2005-07-27T16:41:00.000Z	kbrooks	othernoob	too many libraries rely on programs and vice versa and you wont be able to upgrade to breezy
2005-07-27T16:42:00.000Z	kbrooks	othernoob	with all those libraries lying around.
2005-07-27T16:42:00.000Z	othernoob	kbrooks	heh, apparently, one shouldn't upgrade to breezy anyway :p so that's not the best reason ;)
2005-07-27T16:43:00.000Z	kbrooks	othernoob	that was a example
