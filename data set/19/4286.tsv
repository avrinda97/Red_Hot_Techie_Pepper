2009-05-17T04:06:00.000Z	mgmuscari		hmmm, on a 320gb drive, with 3 200gb drives for general storage, what would be a good size for /usr?
2009-05-17T04:06:00.000Z	mgmuscari		i hate trying to arbitrarily pick sizes for partitions
2009-05-17T04:08:00.000Z	mgmuscari		i think the walkthrough tells you how to build a deb for your distro
2009-05-17T04:08:00.000Z	mgmuscari		i don't remember off the top of my head atm
2009-05-17T04:08:00.000Z	mgmuscari		any thoughts on a good size for /usr? ;)
2009-05-17T04:08:00.000Z	raylu	mgmuscari	why are you making it a separate partition?
2009-05-17T04:09:00.000Z	mgmuscari	raylu	i like to keep things separated
2009-05-17T04:09:00.000Z	raylu	mgmuscari	but if you don't use some space you allocate, you've wasted it. if you use more than you allocate, you're screwed
2009-05-17T04:09:00.000Z	mgmuscari	raylu	that's why i hate partitioning
2009-05-17T04:10:00.000Z	raylu	mgmuscari	in general, unless you have a good reason, you should stick with a single partition for everything else
2009-05-17T04:10:00.000Z	raylu	mgmuscari	the only thing it makes sense to keep separate are /home and /boot, in my opinion
2009-05-17T04:10:00.000Z	raylu		*things
2009-05-17T04:10:00.000Z	mgmuscari	raylu	try installing a different distro or upgrading by doing an install from disc with everything on one massive partition, and you'll understand why i do it this way :p
2009-05-17T04:11:00.000Z	raylu	mgmuscari	i've installed lots of distros... it's not like i keep /usr across distros
2009-05-17T04:11:00.000Z	raylu	mgmuscari	or even across versions
2009-05-17T04:11:00.000Z	mgmuscari	raylu	i usually at least keep /usr/local across distros/versions
2009-05-17T04:12:00.000Z	mgmuscari	raylu	i hope you at least put /home on a separate partition
2009-05-17T04:12:00.000Z	raylu	mgmuscari	i do. but stuff that i need to compile in one distro i may not in another
2009-05-17T04:12:00.000Z	raylu	mgmuscari	and even if i do, they may use different gcc, etc.
