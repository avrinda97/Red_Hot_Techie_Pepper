2010-08-28T20:10:00.000Z	biomass		I just installed u10.4 and activated the restricted nvidia drivers. When X starts I now have what looks like a horizontal grill across my whole screen, every other line is slightly darker/lighter. can I get rid of the stripes somehow ?
2010-08-28T20:11:00.000Z	kellawe	biomass	only on boot or all the time?
2010-08-28T20:12:00.000Z	biomass	kellawe	I only see it in X and it wasn't like this before I activated the restricted drivers. I've got a 120hz tft screen which was detected as 60hz with open drivers, now after turning the restricted drivers on it correctly detects the 120hz.
2010-08-28T20:13:00.000Z	kellawe	biomass	it might be this bug: http://news.softpedia.com/news/How-to-Fix-the-Big-and-Ugly-Plymouth-Logo-in-Ubuntu-10-04-140810.shtml
2010-08-28T20:14:00.000Z	biomass	kellawe	I did see a larger logo so you might be on to something =)
2010-08-28T20:19:00.000Z	biomass	kellawe	looking at the page I can't see any indication that it would change the behaviour of X
2010-08-28T20:20:00.000Z	kellawe	biomass	with X you mean exactly what?
2010-08-28T20:21:00.000Z	biomass	kellawe	I mean what displayed from the login screen and forward
2010-08-28T20:22:00.000Z	kellawe	biomass	ok. well that page actually affects only what comes before the login. so it probably doesn't help you.
2010-08-28T20:23:00.000Z	kellawe	biomass	so you have those orange stripes on the screen all the time?
2010-08-28T20:24:00.000Z	biomass	kellawe	its not orange, every other horizontal pixel line has a lighter/darker tone
2010-08-28T20:26:00.000Z	kellawe	biomass	i wonder where i got that orange :) Well, unfortunately i dont have any more ideas as what might be causing your problem. sorry
2010-08-28T20:27:00.000Z	biomass	kellawe	thanks for trying
2010-08-28T20:27:00.000Z	biomass	kellawe	http://wwww.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1556192 - this person is having the same problem
2010-08-28T20:30:00.000Z	kellawe	biomass	well, cant say anything but that I'm using the same drivers (geforce go 7300) and it's working fine
2010-08-28T20:31:00.000Z	biomass	kellawe	it might be the combination with the screen
2010-08-28T20:32:00.000Z	kellawe	biomass	I suppose you have tried different settings in System->Administration->NVIDIA X Server Settings?
2010-08-28T20:33:00.000Z	biomass	kellawe	yes, I've changed resolution and refresh rate, doesn't seem to matter which I use the problem is still the same
2010-08-28T20:36:00.000Z	biomass	kellawe	scanlines does not change in size when I change resolution
