2009-08-13T12:58:00.000Z	lstarnes	llml	you could put sudo before the individual commands or include chown/chmod
2009-08-13T13:00:00.000Z	llml	lstarnes	yeah, but when i run i, i have to provide password at every sudo commands
2009-08-13T13:00:00.000Z	lstarnes	llml	echo "password" | sudo -S command
2009-08-13T13:01:00.000Z	lstarnes	llml	that is very insecure though, but it might work
2009-08-13T13:01:00.000Z	llml	lstarnes	looking into that
2009-08-13T13:01:00.000Z	lstarnes	llml	use extreme caution with that
2009-08-13T13:02:00.000Z	lstarnes	llml	anyone able to view that script would then be able to view the stored password
2009-08-13T13:02:00.000Z	llml	lstarnes	gotcha!
2009-08-13T13:03:00.000Z	lstarnes	llml	normally, you only need to enter the password the first time if the commands run within a short time
2009-08-13T13:03:00.000Z	lstarnes	llml	if you can, find a more secure methond
2009-08-13T13:05:00.000Z	llml	lstarnes	Gnea: thank you all!
2009-08-13T13:08:00.000Z	lstarnes	llml	no.  It is reading directly from the terminal device
2009-08-13T13:10:00.000Z	llml	lstarnes	yeah, man page says so, i can't tell the difference between stdin and a terminal device when stdin is the terminal input device
2009-08-13T13:10:00.000Z	lstarnes	llml	what usually happens on the terminal is it captures characters from the keyboard input then feeds them into STDIN
2009-08-13T13:11:00.000Z	lstarnes	llml	sometimes, programs will request to capture directly from the terminal and bypass STDIN
2009-08-13T13:11:00.000Z	llml	lstarnes	so terminal device comes first?
2009-08-13T13:11:00.000Z	lstarnes	llml	yes
2009-08-13T13:11:00.000Z	llml	lstarnes	very clear!
2009-08-13T13:11:00.000Z	llml	lstarnes	thanks a looot!
