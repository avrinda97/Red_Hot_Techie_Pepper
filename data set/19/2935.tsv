2010-04-03T21:26:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Wilabob	just did a server install with raid and  lvm I might be able to help, what is your problem?
2010-04-03T21:27:00.000Z	Wilabob	Pirate_Hunter	I'm not doing a server install. The problem is that grub won't install
2010-04-03T21:28:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Wilabob	stick with lilo for raid I still havent managed to get grub working, lilo is simple
2010-04-03T21:28:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Wilabob	and did you put boot in raid1 otherwise it wont boot the system which is a pain
2010-04-03T21:28:00.000Z	Wilabob	Pirate_Hunter	Can I do that without reinstalling?
2010-04-03T21:29:00.000Z	Wilabob	Pirate_Hunter	I don't know..
2010-04-03T21:29:00.000Z	Wilabob	Pirate_Hunter	I was running grub before but I needed to reinstall and now it's not working.
2010-04-03T21:30:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Wilabob	that I ain't too sure but if it is a clean install reinstalling shouldn't be a problem, however, you may want to wait for soemone who can help you fixing that without reinstallinh
2010-04-03T21:31:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Wilabob	you had grub running earlier with raid and it booted the system before you had to reinstall?
2010-04-03T21:34:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Wilabob	lets start from the start what exactly happened, what tutorial did you follow to install ubuntu on raid, since at the moment I am going in circles
2010-04-03T21:40:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Wilabob	if the first time you chose full install and the second time you partitioned a section for boot it wont work I had the same issue had to literally wipe the disk to zero and clear mbr before redoing the process again
2010-04-03T21:41:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Wilabob	for soem reason once raid is chosen you can't undo the partitions unless the disk is wiped I found that quite strange
2010-04-03T21:41:00.000Z	Wilabob	Pirate_Hunter	I never chose raid. So how do I wipe the mbr?
2010-04-03T21:43:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Wilabob	you never chose raid, sorry, so why did you try to create a boot partition, what went wrong the first time
2010-04-03T21:44:00.000Z	Wilabob	Pirate_Hunter	Old bios and I had windows in the seccond partition.
2010-04-03T21:44:00.000Z	Wilabob	Pirate_Hunter	I started this whole thing so that I could get rid of windows...
2010-04-03T21:44:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Wilabob	I think a reinstall is in order otherwise you can try fixing grub yourself
2010-04-03T21:46:00.000Z	Wilabob	Pirate_Hunter	Thing is I've reinstalled like 4 or 5 times since deleting windows and it has never worked, It always has the same grub error.
2010-04-03T21:49:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Wilabob	boot livecd follow the instructions in this link http://how-to.wikia.com/wiki/How_to_wipe_a_hard_drive_clean_in_Linux it even gives you the command to wipe mbr. I think its best to start with a clean hd also you might want to check for any issue with ubuntu and your board, however I very much doubt it
