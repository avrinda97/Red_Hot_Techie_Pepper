2012-10-02T06:03:00.000Z	silverarrow		is there a big difference between RTL8187 and RTL8187B ?
2012-10-02T06:03:00.000Z	silverarrow		it is wifi driverss
2012-10-02T06:03:00.000Z	silverarrow		hi
2012-10-02T06:04:00.000Z	silverarrow		I plug in wifi card, it connects but does not work
2012-10-02T06:05:00.000Z	silverarrow		apparently system loads RTL1817, but driver listed for my card is RTL8187B
2012-10-02T06:05:00.000Z	silverarrow		so, do a "B" more or less make a big difference?
2012-10-02T06:05:00.000Z	silverarrow		I havent heard anything
2012-10-02T06:06:00.000Z	BarkingFish	silverarrow	how does this connect to your PC? USB or it is an internal card?
2012-10-02T06:07:00.000Z	silverarrow	BarkingFish	* sorry
2012-10-02T06:07:00.000Z	BarkingFish	silverarrow	can you open a terminal and run lsusb for me please, and give me the UDIC for the wifi device?
2012-10-02T06:10:00.000Z	BarkingFish	silverarrow	right - I can tell you now, with no uncertainty, that you have the wrong driver running.
2012-10-02T06:11:00.000Z	silverarrow	BarkingFish	the question might be: to "B" or not to "B"
2012-10-02T06:13:00.000Z	BarkingFish	silverarrow	are you running the live CD now?
2012-10-02T06:13:00.000Z	silverarrow	BarkingFish	just installed
2012-10-02T06:14:00.000Z	silverarrow	BarkingFish	thanks anyhow, I suppose that kind of burrying you ohnly do when you are forced to
2012-10-02T06:15:00.000Z	BarkingFish	silverarrow	I'm working as an operational paramedic at the moment, I don't get much time to sit and do a lot - only between the hours of 10pm and 6am which is when I operate.
2012-10-02T06:27:00.000Z	silverarrow	BarkingFish	you are probably all correct on the wrapper thing
2012-10-02T06:30:00.000Z	silverarrow	BarkingFish	in the LTS release ?
