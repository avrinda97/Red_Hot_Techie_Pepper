2011-05-31T23:24:00.000Z	oCean	osse	probably under ~/.thumbnails
2011-05-31T23:26:00.000Z	osse	oCean	not there either.
2011-05-31T23:27:00.000Z	oCean	osse	they should be. rendered thumbnails for any (most?) applications (such as an imageviewer or appearances dialogue) go there in 'normal' subdir
2011-05-31T23:27:00.000Z	oCean	osse	I just tried, and the thumbnails appear in ~/.thumbnails/normal
2011-05-31T23:27:00.000Z	oCean	osse	the actual background images are in /usr/share/backgrounds
2011-05-31T23:29:00.000Z	osse	oCean	in ~/.thumbnails/normal there are over 8000 files on my system :O Yes I know where all the wallpapers are on disk, and I don't want to remove them. I only want to remove them from the list of backgrounds shown in Appearance Preferences
2011-05-31T23:30:00.000Z	oCean	osse	well, that list is generated by looking in the /usr/share/backgrounds directory. As long as the images are there, they will appear in the list. So if you don't move them out of that directory, they will be in the list of available images
2011-05-31T23:32:00.000Z	osse	oCean	but I have added many images to that list by dragging and ropping from ~/Pictures/Wallpapers. And I can click select them in Appearance Preferences and click remove, and this will not delete the file, only remove it from the list
2011-05-31T23:32:00.000Z	oCean	osse	ah wait - now I understand :) Let me see..
2011-05-31T23:32:00.000Z	osse	oCean	so somewhere there must be an xml or something that gives the list of files to show.
2011-05-31T23:32:00.000Z	oCean	osse	something like that, indeed
2011-05-31T23:33:00.000Z	oCean	osse	is it /usr/share/gnome-background-properties/ubuntu-wallpapers.xml ?
2011-05-31T23:35:00.000Z	oCean	osse	hmm, that doesn't seem to hold all wallpapers
2011-05-31T23:35:00.000Z	osse	oCean	hooray! It's ~/.gnome2/backgrounds.xml
2011-05-31T23:36:00.000Z	oCean	osse	aha! Glad you found it :)
2011-05-31T23:37:00.000Z	osse	oCean	I'm sorry if I led you onto a wrong track earlier. It was hard to explain what I acually wanted :P
2011-05-31T23:37:00.000Z	oCean	osse	no problem, good to hear it is solved
2011-05-31T23:39:00.000Z	osse	oCean	actually it turned out to be as simple as just deleting the whole file. It gets automatically regenerated from the default file when I open Appearance Prefs again
2011-05-31T23:39:00.000Z	oCean	osse	nice
