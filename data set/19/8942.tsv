2007-10-19T21:08:00.000Z	Pici	dn4	when running update-manager -c ?
2007-10-19T21:09:00.000Z	Pici	dn4	if you ran `sudo update-manager -c` I could see that happening.
2007-10-19T21:10:00.000Z	dn4	Pici	hmm did not run that
2007-10-19T21:10:00.000Z	Pici	dn4	What did you do?
2007-10-19T21:12:00.000Z	dn4	Pici	Systems -> Admin -> update Manager -> Upgrade
2007-11-02T21:59:00.000Z	Pici	dn4	ps aux
2007-11-02T22:12:00.000Z	Pici	dn4	few?
2007-11-02T22:12:00.000Z	Pici	dn4	on the terminal?
2007-11-02T22:32:00.000Z	Pici	dn4	someone suggest ls -d /*
2007-11-02T22:32:00.000Z	Pici	dn4	rather *suggested
2007-11-02T22:33:00.000Z	Pici	dn4	hm., Try ls -d /full/path/to/directory
2007-11-02T23:07:00.000Z	Pici	dn4	no.  rm -rf .directory
2007-11-02T23:07:00.000Z	Pici	dn4	you want to delete all hidden directories?
2007-11-02T23:07:00.000Z	Pici	dn4	rm -r .* will delete all hidden directories *and* files
2007-11-02T23:09:00.000Z	Pici	dn4	Thats what happens when you do .* , which I suggested tht you probably didnt want to do.,
2007-11-02T23:09:00.000Z	Pici	dn4	There are a lot of settings in there you probably dont want to remove.
2012-09-12T18:21:00.000Z	Pici	dn4	Perhaps you should clarify what you mean by "why does ubuntu need to upgrade flash"?
2012-09-12T18:24:00.000Z	Pici	dn4	Agreed.
