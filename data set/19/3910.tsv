2009-06-04T21:27:00.000Z	pwner		im a linux noob, and im looking for help with a problem im having
2009-06-04T21:27:00.000Z	pwner		anybody mind helping a noob?
2009-06-04T21:27:00.000Z	pwner		ok]
2009-06-04T21:28:00.000Z	pwner		I'm using Ubuntu 9.04 with an ATI Radeon HD4830 video card, and I cannot seem to get the sound to work through HDMI.
2009-06-04T21:29:00.000Z	pwner		Sound actually comes to my tv through the video card in windows.. and i have a friend get it working once, until i restarted ubuntu, then it quit
2009-06-04T21:31:00.000Z	pwner		there id an hdmi sound output, yes
2009-06-04T21:31:00.000Z	pwner		iS*
2009-06-04T21:32:00.000Z	pwner		I have, and it is there, and HDMI is set as the sound output device
2009-06-04T21:32:00.000Z	pwner		but, i still get no sound at all... and no it's not muted, by the way
2009-06-04T21:33:00.000Z	jefinc	pwner	is it unmuted in the alsamixer?
2009-06-04T21:33:00.000Z	jefinc	pwner	do you load the alsa mixer by; alsamixer -V al ?
2009-06-04T21:35:00.000Z	jefinc	pwner	it was supposed to let you see ALL of the audio devices to ensure that it wasn't muted
2009-06-04T21:36:00.000Z	jefinc	pwner	as I have never used HDMI in ubuntu that is the only advice I can offer
2009-06-04T21:36:00.000Z	jefinc	pwner	because you were supposed to do: alsamixer -V al
2009-06-04T21:37:00.000Z	jefinc	pwner	 -V is view, then you have to set what you would like to view, al for all
2009-06-04T21:38:00.000Z	jefinc	pwner	using the arrow keys you can navigate left and right, up and down will change the volume level and m with mute/unmute, if there is a MM under the bar it is muted, try scrolling over and see if HDMI shows anywhere
2009-06-04T21:39:00.000Z	jefinc	pwner	if you do not find HDMI anywhere I would suggest just trying to unmute everything that is not common, things like "LINE" does not need to be unmuted for instance
2009-06-04T21:44:00.000Z	jefinc	pwner	NVIDIA?
