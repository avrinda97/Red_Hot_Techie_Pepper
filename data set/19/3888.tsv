2010-01-16T20:07:00.000Z	Curly_Q		Is this mingw32 a POSIX compliant compiler?
2010-01-16T20:08:00.000Z	erUSUL	Curly_Q	as far as i know posix does not cover any C compiler
2010-01-16T20:09:00.000Z	erUSUL	Curly_Q	heard of what?
2010-01-16T20:13:00.000Z	erUSUL	Curly_Q	yes i know what posix is, but again posix spec does not cover the compiler only the Operating system API and some tools. Linux is posix compliant bash can be. but there is no spec for a posix compliant C compiler
2010-01-16T20:15:00.000Z	erUSUL	Curly_Q	i dunno; what are you trying to do ? that would help me guess ehat you want to know
2010-01-16T20:16:00.000Z	erUSUL	Curly_Q	writte posix compliant C programs in linux that will run unmodified in windows ??? then you can do that with mingw
2010-01-16T20:16:00.000Z	erUSUL	Curly_Q	the most used compiler in Linux is gcc
2010-01-16T20:17:00.000Z	erUSUL	Curly_Q	if you want to program in linux in C you use gcc
2010-01-16T20:18:00.000Z	erUSUL	Curly_Q	what are you compiling ?
2010-01-16T20:20:00.000Z	erUSUL	Curly_Q	why not use a precompiled ircd Â¿?
2010-01-16T20:21:00.000Z	erUSUL	Curly_Q	we do not support red hat here
2010-02-27T00:50:00.000Z	erUSUL	Curly_Q	no
2010-02-27T00:51:00.000Z	erUSUL	Curly_Q	only the oposite is true. a 32 bit ubuntu should work on a x86_64 cpu becouse they are backwards compatible
2010-02-27T00:52:00.000Z	erUSUL	Curly_Q	yes there is a i386 server iso image in all mirrors
2010-03-08T22:26:00.000Z	erUSUL	Curly_Q	apt installs both the programs and the dependencies from the same repositories
2010-03-08T22:26:00.000Z	Curly_Q	erUSUL	are those included with the installation of Ubuntu from the outset?
2010-03-08T22:27:00.000Z	erUSUL	Curly_Q	i do not understand your question; what is included?
2010-03-09T01:30:00.000Z	erUSUL	Curly_Q	on the aame lan you can configure wake on lan
