2007-06-26T07:07:00.000Z	Igr		how do i mount an .ISO file?
2007-06-26T07:08:00.000Z	pha|con	Igr	sudo mount -t iso9660 -o loop /dev/[yourdevice]  /mnt
2007-06-26T07:10:00.000Z	pha|con	Igr	you tell it what files it is.  you type in the command line sudo mount -t iso9660 -o loop filename.iso /mnt
2007-06-26T07:10:00.000Z	pha|con	Igr	filename.iso = whatever the file's name is
2007-06-26T07:19:00.000Z	pha|con	Igr	in the command line type sudo apt-get install wine
2007-06-26T07:49:00.000Z	pha|con	Igr	sudo apt-get install wine
2007-06-26T07:50:00.000Z	pha|con	Igr	after it's installed you run the .exe file from the command line....  wine filename.exe
2007-06-26T07:51:00.000Z	pha|con	Igr	because windows comes pre-installed on most computers.
2007-06-26T07:52:00.000Z	pha|con	Igr	because more people have windows
2007-06-26T07:52:00.000Z	pha|con	Igr	basically it's a case of where the money is
2007-06-26T07:52:00.000Z	pha|con	Igr	you don't need daemon tools for linux
2007-06-26T07:52:00.000Z	pha|con	Igr	no, if you want to mount an iso just type sudo mount -t iso9660 -o loop filename.iso /mnt in the command line
2007-06-26T07:53:00.000Z	pha|con	Igr	if it's not an .iso you can convert it to one with any number of programs
2007-06-26T07:53:00.000Z	pha|con	Igr	then you run the .exe file with wine
2007-06-26T07:53:00.000Z	pha|con	Igr	but you have to check the the compatibilty list to see if it will even run.
2007-06-26T07:55:00.000Z	pha|con	Igr	in command line type wine filename.exe
2007-06-26T07:56:00.000Z	pha|con	Igr	i already told you.... sudo apt-get install wine
