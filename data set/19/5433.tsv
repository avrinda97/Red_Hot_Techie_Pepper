2009-04-24T05:17:00.000Z	WebcamWonder		What is the best way to upgrade when you have quite a few external repositories enabled? Disable them, upgrade, change them to jaunty and re-enable? Or to just directly change them to jaunty and let the updates handle themselves?
2009-04-24T05:18:00.000Z	xanderp	WebcamWonder	I believe the recommended way is to disable extra repos, upgrade, then add back in the jaunty versions.
2009-04-24T05:18:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	xanderp	And if the versions provided by the repo are actually greater than the versions provided by the official distribution, then what will happen?
2009-04-24T05:19:00.000Z	xanderp	WebcamWonder	should leave them alone.
2009-04-24T05:19:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	xanderp	And what if they are incompatible with jaunty? My biggest concern is my installation of firefox 3.5, which I did from a PPA
2009-04-24T05:20:00.000Z	xanderp	WebcamWonder	you needed something custom in your firefox?
2009-04-24T05:20:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	xanderp	No. I have firefox 3.5 installed from an external repo. Would it be removed if I disable the external repo?
2009-04-24T05:21:00.000Z	xanderp	WebcamWonder	no, I don't think so... i've turned off repos before and it leaves the software alone
2009-04-24T05:21:00.000Z	xanderp	WebcamWonder	you could always uninstall firefox, do the upgrade and reinstall firefox if you were really paranoid...
2009-04-24T05:22:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	xanderp	Haha. Thanks a bunch for your help!
2009-04-24T05:22:00.000Z	xanderp	WebcamWonder	i've not run into any problems from upping before, other than when I screwed up my config files. (overwrote custom settings)
2009-04-24T05:23:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	xanderp	hmm, so backup would be "officially" recommend. Is it really necessary?
2009-04-24T05:24:00.000Z	xanderp	WebcamWonder	is this your 'production' machine?  if it is, then the answer is always YES.  No matter what you are doing.
2009-04-24T05:24:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	xanderp	Well, just my home pc. My only OS, and my only PC, so I guess it could be considered very sacred from my POV
2009-04-24T05:25:00.000Z	xanderp	WebcamWonder	do you have an 'out'?  if you thrash the setup, can you get back up and going again without having any working machines in the house?  I always try to avoid kicking ladders out from under my feet while I'm standing on them.
2009-04-24T05:26:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	xanderp	I'll try to get atleast a backup of my imp data going... and then think about mounting /home to a separate partition
2009-04-24T05:27:00.000Z	xanderp	WebcamWonder	I highly recommend investing in an eSATA or external USB/Firewire drive to backup to... makes for quick backups.
