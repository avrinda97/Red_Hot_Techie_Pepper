2010-05-03T02:17:00.000Z	Aubergenie		hi, can anyone help me with a failed 9.10>10.04 upgrade attempt?
2010-05-03T02:18:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Aubergenie	i doubt it, lol. but i'm willing to try
2010-05-03T02:20:00.000Z	Aubergenie	onetinsoldier	worth a shot i suppose ;) upgrade manager crapped out with "An unresolvable problem occurred while calculating the upgrade:
2010-05-03T02:21:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Aubergenie	roger. hang on a bit...
2010-05-03T02:23:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Aubergenie	there's a command line way to try and upgrade. not certain what it it is. i'll need to ask..
2010-05-03T02:24:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Aubergenie	you see that? try on the command line --> do-release-upgrade
2010-05-03T02:24:00.000Z	Aubergenie	onetinsoldier	yeah thanks, ill try that!
2010-05-03T02:25:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Aubergenie	roger. tell me what happens
2010-05-03T02:36:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Aubergenie	hello. you tried that command yet? just wondering if it's working yet
2010-05-03T02:40:00.000Z	Aubergenie	onetinsoldier	hi, yeah i tried it but i got the same message. looking at apt.log seems i have broken depends which im hastily trying to fix..
2010-05-03T02:42:00.000Z	Aubergenie	onetinsoldier	from apt.log - Package xserver-xorg-video-all has broken Depends on xserver-xorg-video-nouveau
2010-05-03T02:45:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Aubergenie	roger.. hang on
2010-05-03T02:46:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Aubergenie	what happens if you try --> apt-get install xserver-xorg-video-nouveau
2010-05-03T02:47:00.000Z	Aubergenie	onetinsoldier	:) just re-installing via synaptic
2010-05-03T02:48:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Aubergenie	not sure i understand... you mean it just reinstalls it? or you installing it right now so that it will be upgraded?
2010-05-03T02:49:00.000Z	Aubergenie	onetinsoldier	sorry, i didn't make myself clear. Ive just replaced xserver-xorg-video-all via synaptic
2010-05-03T02:50:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Aubergenie	ahh, roger. well, that'll probably do the trick! i have to be going... good luck
2010-05-03T02:51:00.000Z	Aubergenie	onetinsoldier	me too, thanks for your help, ill get there!
2010-05-03T02:51:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Aubergenie	you're welcome. cheers :)
