2009-10-29T07:01:00.000Z	phaidonx		so I am trying to install a .deb file but it's complaining about a  dependency that cannot be satisfied libqt4-opengl ( >=4.5.1) From what I can tell that's only on Karmic but I am still on Jaunty, anyway to get that libqt4-opengl 4.51?
2009-10-29T07:02:00.000Z	Lint	phaidonx	add the karmic repository manually
2009-10-29T07:04:00.000Z	phaidonx		Lint in /etc/apt/sources.list? which one? restricted, universe multiverse?
2009-10-29T07:04:00.000Z	Lint	phaidonx	main, I believe
2009-10-29T07:04:00.000Z	phaidonx	Lint	won't that conflict with my current jaunty source?
2009-10-29T07:05:00.000Z	Lint	phaidonx	it won't unless you'll try to upgrade
2009-10-29T07:05:00.000Z	phaidonx	Lint	aha! Iam likely going to at some point... so when I need to upgrade just comment that out?
2009-10-29T07:05:00.000Z	Lint	phaidonx	yes
2009-10-29T07:07:00.000Z	phaidonx	Lint	So I just added main and then sudo apt-get update and looked into synaptic and I don't see 4.5.1 :s
2009-10-29T07:07:00.000Z	Lint	phaidonx	did you reload package lists? you should see many updated packages
2009-10-29T07:08:00.000Z	phaidonx	Lint	what do you mean by reload?
2009-10-29T07:09:00.000Z	Lint	phaidonx	press Reload button in Synaptic, for example
2009-10-29T07:09:00.000Z	Lint		!se
2009-10-29T07:09:00.000Z	phaidonx		aha! I hadn't hit the save button on sources.list :p
2009-10-29T07:10:00.000Z	phaidonx	Lint	argh, still no 4.5.1 in synaptic :(
2009-10-29T07:12:00.000Z	Lint	phaidonx	do you see upgradable package list? is that library there?
2009-10-29T07:14:00.000Z	phaidonx	Lint	no it's not... nothing is upgradable either ..
2009-10-29T07:15:00.000Z	Lint	phaidonx	strange, it worked for me some time ago... do you see a new repository in 'Software Sources'?
2009-10-29T07:18:00.000Z	phaidonx	Lint	argh, stupid me ... I added ppa.launchpad instead of the actual karmic main. Thanks!
