2005-02-06T06:52:00.000Z	bebek		hello
2005-02-06T06:52:00.000Z	bebek		xine-check told me that DMA is disabled for my dvd drive.. how can i enable it? my playback for dvd movies are jerky
2005-02-06T06:53:00.000Z	scizzo	bebek	sudo hdparm -d1 -c1 /dev/dvd if you have that device or are using it for the dvd stuff
2005-02-06T06:55:00.000Z	bebek	scizzo	it says that operation not permitted
2005-02-06T06:57:00.000Z	scizzo	bebek	try using the normal device then
2005-02-06T06:57:00.000Z	scizzo	bebek	more /etc/fstab
2005-02-06T06:57:00.000Z	scizzo	bebek	find the DVD player
2005-02-06T06:57:00.000Z	scizzo	bebek	no not the mount point
2005-02-06T06:58:00.000Z	scizzo	bebek	that does not help a lot
2005-02-06T06:58:00.000Z	scizzo	bebek	you need to tell it exactly what to put the options on
2005-02-06T06:58:00.000Z	scizzo	bebek	and I hardly belive that the DVD player is on hda
2005-02-06T06:59:00.000Z	scizzo	bebek	hda is the first disk
2005-02-06T06:59:00.000Z	scizzo	bebek	hmmm
2005-02-06T07:02:00.000Z	scizzo	bebek	how are things listed in fstab?
2005-02-06T07:05:00.000Z	scizzo	bebek	you need to do that in the kernel yes
2005-02-06T07:05:00.000Z	bebek	scizzo	is there any easy way of doing this?
2005-02-06T07:06:00.000Z	scizzo	bebek	the best is to actually recompile the kernel with that stuff
2005-02-06T07:06:00.000Z	scizzo	bebek	its my suggestion to you
2005-02-06T07:06:00.000Z	scizzo	bebek	use the lspci list to find out other chipsets also
