2007-09-19T12:51:00.000Z	PKdoR	ziv	why not try Open Office?
2007-09-19T12:52:00.000Z	ziv		its for my dad
2007-09-19T12:52:00.000Z	ziv		I used open office but my dad is pretty much an A hole when it comes to open source
2007-09-19T12:53:00.000Z	PKdoR	ziv	if anything and if you must osu M$ Office the I would sugest to install it with wine
2007-09-19T12:53:00.000Z	ziv		pkdor: I know wine but I read there is another program...
2007-09-19T12:54:00.000Z	ziv		pkdor: does VMware needs a good pc?
2007-09-19T12:54:00.000Z	PKdoR	ziv	I belive that it depend alot on the OS you will be emulating
2007-09-19T12:55:00.000Z	ziv		pkdor: well then I'll use wine
2007-09-19T12:56:00.000Z	PKdoR	ziv	and then there is Vbox, but I'v never personally used that one I go with VMware/VMPlayer
2007-09-19T12:56:00.000Z	ziv		pkdor: it's k
2007-09-19T12:56:00.000Z	ziv		pkdor: I installed ubuntu once before and there was something I needed to change so I can install commercial apps through add/remove where is it?
2007-09-19T12:56:00.000Z	ziv	gert	good evening
2007-09-19T12:57:00.000Z	PKdoR	ziv	 it might be under "Third Party Apps"
2007-09-19T12:58:00.000Z	PKdoR	ziv	 thats where vmware is
2007-09-19T12:58:00.000Z	ziv		pkdor: it was a text file and I had to uncomment some lines
2007-09-19T12:58:00.000Z	ziv		pkdor: oops
2007-09-19T12:58:00.000Z	ziv		pkdor: I'll use wine
2007-09-19T12:59:00.000Z	PKdoR	ziv	Thats probably the most easy/reasonablr way next to just using Open Office.
