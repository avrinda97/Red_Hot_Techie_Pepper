2005-03-25T11:09:00.000Z	ells	johso	dont know why
2005-03-25T11:09:00.000Z	johso	ells	okay - sounds strange... have you tried reinstalling it?
2005-03-25T11:10:00.000Z	ells		naw, here is what is says, Error: Could not read from socket: Connection reset by peer
2005-03-25T11:11:00.000Z	johso	ells	hmm, I'm not really _that_ familliar with it, but my best guess is to reinstall it, if it's not caused by the server..
2005-03-25T11:11:00.000Z	ells	johso	well I can get in thru the console
2005-03-25T11:11:00.000Z	ells	johso	sounds fishy
2005-03-25T11:12:00.000Z	johso	ells	Indeed...
2005-03-25T11:12:00.000Z	ells	johso	wonder why I can thru console and not graphically
2005-03-25T11:13:00.000Z	johso	ells	yea, doesn't make any sense... but as I said before, try to reinstall gftp?
2005-03-25T11:13:00.000Z	ells	johso	I reinstalled, I can connect thru gftp to gnome
2005-03-25T11:13:00.000Z	johso	ells	gftp to gnome? now I'm confused
2005-03-25T11:14:00.000Z	ells	johso	it is listed as a site on the program that you can go to if you want
2005-03-25T11:14:00.000Z	ells	johso	verifying that the program works
2005-03-25T11:15:00.000Z	johso	ells	Oh, didn't know that - so it's working now?
