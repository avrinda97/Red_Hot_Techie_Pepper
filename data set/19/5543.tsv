2008-06-13T07:21:00.000Z	SonicComKid		Could someone help me with a fairly easy question?
2008-06-13T07:22:00.000Z	SonicComKid		I currently have a box acting as a network bridge. ie. Router->Server box with two network cards<-Windows XP box connected to server via other network card
2008-06-13T07:22:00.000Z	SonicComKid		if I install Ubuntu server on it. How do I bridge the two network adaptors to share internet and other resources across the two adaptors?
2008-06-13T07:23:00.000Z	SonicComKid		In windows XP I simply selected the two network adaptors, right clicked, and clicked 'bridge'. How do you do it with Ubuntu Server Edition?
2008-06-13T07:25:00.000Z	SonicComKid		....anybody know?
2008-06-13T07:26:00.000Z	SonicComKid		Does anybody here know how to bridge two network adatpors together in Ubuntu Server Edition (8.04)?
2008-06-13T07:26:00.000Z	bobstro	SonicComKid	 haven't done link aggregation myself, but there's a lot about it on the high availability pages. no right-click giu i suspect.
2008-06-13T07:27:00.000Z	SonicComKid	bobstro	where? I tried the forum with no luck
2008-06-13T07:28:00.000Z	bobstro	SonicComKid	 not sure of anything on ubuntu sites, but take a look at http://linux-ip.net/html/ether-bonding.html
2008-06-13T07:28:00.000Z	bobstro	SonicComKid	 i'd look for general howtos rather than anything specific to ubuntu to start with. find solution that fits what  you need, and then maybe look for ubuntu-specific approach.
2008-06-13T07:29:00.000Z	bobstro	SonicComKid	 are you after high-availability?
2008-06-13T07:30:00.000Z	SonicComKid	bobstro	no
2008-06-13T07:30:00.000Z	bobstro	SonicComKid	 you've got switch etc. that supports aggregation, right?
2008-06-13T07:32:00.000Z	bobstro	SonicComKid	 oh, use the LINUX box as a switch in effect?
2008-06-13T07:32:00.000Z	bobstro	SonicComKid	 sorry, from your description sounded like aggregation.
2008-06-13T07:33:00.000Z	bobstro	SonicComKid	 you don't want linux box to be firewall or anything? just literally a bridge?
2008-06-13T07:33:00.000Z	bobstro	SonicComKid	 you can certainly do that but it sounds overly complex.
2008-06-13T07:34:00.000Z	bobstro	SonicComKid	 you can bridge intefaces... but i haven't done it in a LONG time on linux.
2008-06-13T07:35:00.000Z	bobstro	SonicComKid	 so like 2nd option here http://www.linux.com/feature/133849 ?
