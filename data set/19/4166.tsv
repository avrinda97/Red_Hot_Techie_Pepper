2010-02-01T04:20:00.000Z	electrofreak		why is ffmpeg giving me "Unsupported codec for output stream #0.0" for output format mp3???
2010-02-01T04:22:00.000Z	electrofreak		does anyone know why ffmpeg is giving me "Unsupported codec for output stream #0.0" for output format mp3???
2010-02-01T04:23:00.000Z	acicula	electrofreak	ffmpeg is compiled without mp3 support
2010-02-01T04:23:00.000Z	electrofreak	acicula	why??
2010-02-01T04:23:00.000Z	acicula	electrofreak	its a proprietaty format that puts restrictions on who distributes it
2010-02-01T04:24:00.000Z	acicula	electrofreak	you can find custom builds of ffmpeg in ppa probably, and medibuntu repo provides everything you need to fork with mp
2010-02-01T04:25:00.000Z	electrofreak	acicula	ok, sure, I get the free format thing or whatever..... but it's MP3.... the defacto audio standard for most everything... why would they take it out if they want to create an easy/seamless experience for users??
2010-02-01T04:26:00.000Z	acicula	electrofreak	because the license does not allow redistributing it
2010-02-01T04:26:00.000Z	acicula	electrofreak	offenders are not prosecuted
2010-02-01T04:26:00.000Z	electrofreak	acicula	I have no problem compiling my own thing... but other people might. I'm just puzzled as to why they would do that.
2010-02-01T04:26:00.000Z	acicula	electrofreak	most people have no need for that, afaik medibuntu provides programs and mp3 support to deal with mp3
2010-02-01T04:27:00.000Z	acicula	electrofreak	have a look at ubuntu-restricted-extras and medibuntu
2010-02-01T04:27:00.000Z	electrofreak	acicula	ok, I will do that. thanks. Or, yeah, maybe I'll just use lame.
2010-02-01T04:29:00.000Z	acicula	electrofreak	also regarding seamless, if ubuntu cannot play an mp3 it will tell you that it needs restricted stuff
2010-02-01T04:29:00.000Z	electrofreak	acicula	heh, not in the terminal
2010-02-01T04:29:00.000Z	acicula	electrofreak	terminals are not seamless experiences
2010-02-01T04:30:00.000Z	electrofreak	acicula	lol. yeah, I guess the average users doesn't know what a terminal is.
2010-02-01T04:44:00.000Z	electrofreak	acicula	oh crap... lame doesn't convert from flac? dang it.
2010-02-01T04:45:00.000Z	acicula	electrofreak	i dont know anything about encoding/recoding
