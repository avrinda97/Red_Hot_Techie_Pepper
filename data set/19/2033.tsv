2010-10-07T14:52:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	pause	what ubuntu version are you using? and pastebin: rfkill list
2010-10-07T14:53:00.000Z	pause	ilovefairuz	running 9.04 (i need to, beacause the latest version i could install on my netbook cause the others had intsallation issues)
2010-10-07T14:54:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	pause	support (and package updates) for this release will end on 23 oct
2010-10-07T14:55:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	pause	but anyhow, try this and reboot: sudo apt-get install Â linux-backports-modules-jaunty
2010-10-07T14:56:00.000Z	pause	ilovefairuz	i know...but the newer versions have a installation bug, on this perticular netbook. So i needed to install an old verison in order to be able to do the normal "update manager" upgrade
2010-10-07T14:56:00.000Z	pause	ilovefairuz	i just need internet once on this version! :S
2010-10-07T14:56:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	pause	well you need the internet to download this package, don't you have a wired connection?
2010-10-07T14:58:00.000Z	pause	ilovefairuz	it is both the wired and wireless connection that is malfunctioning
2010-10-07T14:58:00.000Z	pause	ilovefairuz	did u check my pastbin (http://paste.ubuntu.com/507902/)?
2010-10-07T14:59:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	pause	yes, looked at the pastebin again, they both lack drivers, i think you should try maverick's RC1 cd
2010-10-07T15:01:00.000Z	pause	ilovefairuz	the same version (9.04) and with the RC1 instead?
2010-10-07T15:01:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	pause	nope, 10.10
2010-10-07T15:01:00.000Z	pause	ilovefairuz	okej, ill try
