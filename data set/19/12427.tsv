2005-09-18T16:32:00.000Z	Bubblefly		I sure wish the proprietary drivers for my ATI card didn't suck. >.>
2005-09-18T16:32:00.000Z	Bubblefly		Actually, I"m just mad at them for not supporting xv output
2005-09-18T16:33:00.000Z	erUSUL	Bubblefly	i use free radeon drivers and have xv
2005-09-18T16:33:00.000Z	Bubblefly	erUSUL	Oooooh. :3
2005-09-18T16:34:00.000Z	Bubblefly	erUSUL	Can I do that with my ATI All-in-Wonder Radeon 8500 DV? ^^
2005-09-18T16:35:00.000Z	erUSUL	Bubblefly	why not?
2005-09-18T16:35:00.000Z	Bubblefly	erUSUL	I'm a clueless semi-newbie...? I don't suppose there's some kind of handy how-to? :3
2005-09-18T16:40:00.000Z	erUSUL	Bubblefly	i can't find any. the propietary drivers don't work for you?
2005-09-18T16:42:00.000Z	Bubblefly	erUSUL	They work, they just don't support xv when I'm playing video files, and they tend to look bad/lag without it. o.O
2005-09-18T16:44:00.000Z	erUSUL	Bubblefly	too bad. Is extrange that they don't support xv
2005-09-18T16:45:00.000Z	Bubblefly	erUSUL	Where do I get the drivers you use? Maybe I could figure it out. :3
2005-09-18T16:45:00.000Z	erUSUL	Bubblefly	 they come whit ubuntu man radeon

2005-09-18T16:54:00.000Z	Bubblefly	erUSUL	Hmmm... I just changed the driver to "radeon" in xorg.conf and it seems to be working... :3
2005-09-18T16:54:00.000Z	erUSUL	Bubblefly	nice to know ;)
2005-09-18T16:57:00.000Z	Bubblefly	erUSUL	Though it seemed to be working before I restarted X... >.> I have no idea why it would be.
2005-09-18T16:57:00.000Z	Bubblefly	erUSUL	Guess I don't need to know the why as long as it works. :D
