2006-03-22T12:10:00.000Z	chuckyp	cK-gLocK	or which partition did you install first?
2006-03-22T12:10:00.000Z	chuckyp	cK-gLocK	and do you care abouttht edata?
2006-03-22T12:11:00.000Z	chuckyp	cK-gLocK	well you could just delete the 32bit windows then install dapper on the third partition and hopefully grub will pick up the windows 64bit and the hoary install.
2006-03-22T12:12:00.000Z	chuckyp	cK-gLocK	oh well then just delete what ever partitions you want to delete as long as you don't touch the xp partition that you want to keep you won't have a problem.
2006-03-22T12:12:00.000Z	chuckyp	cK-gLocK	yeah I'm pretty sure quake is released for linux and windows side by side.
2006-03-22T12:14:00.000Z	chuckyp	cK-gLocK	yeah back up everything you are worried about.
2006-03-22T12:15:00.000Z	chuckyp	cK-gLocK	what is quake 4 the newest quake they have a linux demo out you could try on hoary if you are not sure.
2006-03-22T12:16:00.000Z	chuckyp	cK-gLocK	no shouldn't be any different
