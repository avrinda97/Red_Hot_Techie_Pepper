2012-01-03T15:52:00.000Z	metaspikes	remoteCTRL	or a masqeurade of some sort
2012-01-03T15:53:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	metaspikes	there is absolutely NOTHING let through the firewall into the red zone. only outgoing traffic, no ssh ingoing, nothing.
2012-01-03T16:02:00.000Z	metaspikes	remoteCTRL	i dunno, have a look with wireshark or something. i wouldnt recommend running anything after 10.04 on a production machine either as there are more bugs and more secuirty issues
2012-01-03T16:04:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	metaspikes	the upgrades are a pain in the a** but other than that we do love our ubuntu.
2012-01-03T16:06:00.000Z	metaspikes	remoteCTRL	if you really want to secure a system, i recommend running bastilla and /or checksecurity also, as a easy way to righten security
2012-01-03T16:06:00.000Z	metaspikes	remoteCTRL	sorry. bastille
2012-01-03T16:06:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	metaspikes	interesting! are those like virus scans?
2012-01-03T16:07:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	metaspikes	or more like ACL enforcement?
2012-01-03T16:07:00.000Z	metaspikes	remoteCTRL	no, clamav is the only antivirus really in the repo, those are security hardening programs that check permissions and other things that the default distrobutions where to pansy to impliment, or that become faulty as things get changed.
2012-01-03T16:11:00.000Z	metaspikes	remoteCTRL	iceroot is also correct however, you gotta nip this on the bud i think that mint is a bad idea for you at this point. good luck
2012-01-03T16:12:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	metaspikes	similar to monit, so to speak
2012-01-03T16:14:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	metaspikes	do those apps require customization?
2012-01-03T16:15:00.000Z	metaspikes	remoteCTRL	balliste will ask you dozens of questions if you let it, it's pretty damn paranoid but i like that
2012-01-03T16:16:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	metaspikes	suitable for servers then... how about checksecurity?
2012-01-03T16:17:00.000Z	metaspikes	remoteCTRL	it's suitable for hardening security, however if you stick with your current system, it may not suffice, checksecurity i dunno
2012-01-03T16:18:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	metaspikes	iceroot: ok guys, the mint computer was an experiment, as noone here really seems to like unity, neither gnome 3, i think i will declare the experiment done...
2012-01-03T16:19:00.000Z	metaspikes	remoteCTRL	also have a look at your actual router's security permissions, that's your first line of defence after all.
2012-01-03T16:20:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	metaspikes	we have ip-cop distro running as router, atm i am completely petrified about it, considering that this japanese guy smoehow obviously got through it
2012-01-03T16:21:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	metaspikes	i will consider your advise and try to start lauching now
