2004-12-08T07:40:00.000Z	ogra	Rene_S	if you compile more often you may like to install gnome-core-devel
2004-12-08T07:43:00.000Z	Rene_S	ogra	normally i would have used the available deb, but for some reason I could not make it work
2004-12-08T07:43:00.000Z	Rene_S	ogra	thanks for the tip though I probably will do that now, just in case

2005-01-15T17:15:00.000Z	ogra	Rene_S	you just upgraded from warty ?
2005-01-15T17:16:00.000Z	ogra	Rene_S	have you installed the metapackages before upgrading if you uninstalled them .... for example ubuntu-desktop
2005-01-15T17:18:00.000Z	ogra	Rene_S	the metapackages care that you get everything needed by the new system installed.....
2005-01-15T17:18:00.000Z	ogra	Rene_S	so if you installed totem-xine before ubuntu-desktop would be gone....
2005-01-15T17:19:00.000Z	ogra	Rene_S	please dont flood in here
2005-01-15T17:20:00.000Z	Rene_S	ogra	ok thats quite enough, this is a bloody support channel, if i cant post the error in here then fuck it, I am onto something that is worth installing that works on its basic level.
2005-01-15T17:21:00.000Z	ogra	Rene_S	we have #flood for flooding...
