2009-06-04T03:12:00.000Z	cabrey	Mike_lifeguard	what version of ubuntu?
2009-06-04T03:12:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	cabrey	jaunty
2009-06-04T03:12:00.000Z	cabrey	Mike_lifeguard	is your system fully up to date?
2009-06-04T03:12:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	cabrey	yes, but I've been told to use a newer kernel :)
2009-06-04T03:13:00.000Z	cabrey	Mike_lifeguard	you can manually install never kernels from here: http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/
2009-06-11T05:50:00.000Z	cabrey	Mike_lifeguard	aptitude search
2009-06-11T05:50:00.000Z	cabrey	Mike_lifeguard	aptitude show package_name *
2009-06-11T06:27:00.000Z	cabrey	Mike_lifeguard	no
2009-06-11T06:27:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	cabrey	not even to uninstall?
2009-06-11T06:27:00.000Z	cabrey	Mike_lifeguard	thats right
2009-06-25T09:23:00.000Z	cabrey	Mike_lifeguard	/proc is a virtual folder created by the kernel for the kernel
2009-06-25T09:28:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	cabrey	so, /proc/cmdline doesn't get created until boot... where does that come from? Apparently it is being generated wrong. Specifically, it looked like it referred to the uuid of my root partition on my old HD ... should be easy enough to swap in the new uuid or something, except that it doesn't exist until boot :\
2009-06-25T09:29:00.000Z	cabrey	Mike_lifeguard	you would edit /boot/grub/menu.lst, not the kernel fs
2009-06-25T09:29:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	cabrey	I did - swapped in the uuid for the new partition where /boot is found
2009-06-25T09:29:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	cabrey	do I need to update grub after doing that or somesuch?
2009-06-25T09:30:00.000Z	cabrey	Mike_lifeguard	no it the kernel should be passed the new UUID argument
2009-06-25T09:30:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	cabrey	k, well I'll double-check the new uuid is in menu.lst
2009-06-25T09:34:00.000Z	cabrey	Mike_lifeguard	yea thats what i meant
