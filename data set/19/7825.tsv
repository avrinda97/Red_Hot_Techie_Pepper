2007-06-16T12:54:00.000Z	NeXtDaY	jamman	cache does the same thing as apt-get and aptitude?
2007-06-16T12:55:00.000Z	jamman	NeXtDaY	no, not quite... i think its more of a search type thing like sudo aptitude search ...
2007-06-16T12:55:00.000Z	NeXtDaY	jamman	ah ok. I didn't know that until now. thanks again
2007-06-16T12:56:00.000Z	jamman	NeXtDaY	no problem. i learned a couple of days ago myself.
2007-06-16T14:20:00.000Z	jamman	NeXtDaY	yes i have.
2007-06-16T14:21:00.000Z	NeXtDaY	jamman	I am about to install it.. is it good as it looks on the site? useful?
2007-06-16T14:22:00.000Z	jamman	NeXtDaY	a little slow, mostly because they've just changed the code to have it work in linux more like a wine thing.
2007-06-16T14:23:00.000Z	NeXtDaY	jamman	hmm, So you advice me to install it anyway and give it a try?
2007-06-16T14:24:00.000Z	NeXtDaY	jamman	ok, np :)
2007-06-16T14:24:00.000Z	jamman	NeXtDaY	Yes. Its handy and cool and works well. I just like F-Spot better.

2007-06-16T14:24:00.000Z	jamman	NeXtDaY	no prob.
