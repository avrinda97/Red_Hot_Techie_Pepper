2008-02-05T07:52:00.000Z	Malaz		So, how to install a later version of SDL.  How to update from 1.2.11.  Please help, I'm dying over here!
2008-02-05T07:52:00.000Z	Malaz		Stuck in a bug.  Can't play starcon 2!  Terrible!
2008-02-05T07:52:00.000Z	Malaz		oh...  Well, thanks for actually responding.  You're the first!
2008-02-05T07:53:00.000Z	Malaz		Noob question: How would I go about upgrading SDL to a later version (than 1.2.11)?
2008-02-05T07:54:00.000Z	Tonren	Malaz	If you're referring to upgrading SDL beyond the version supplied in the repositories, then unfortunately, it isn't really within realistic reach of a "noob".
2008-02-05T07:55:00.000Z	Malaz	Tonren	 Well, thanks for responding.  I suppose there will be a new version in the repos with the release of 8.04?
2008-02-05T07:56:00.000Z	Tonren	Malaz	That's probable.  The unfortunate thing about Ubuntu's package-based distribution system is that it's hard for inexperienced users (and a hassle for experienced users) to go past the versions in the repositories.
2008-02-05T07:56:00.000Z	Tonren	Malaz	And the maintainers can't upgrade versions frivolously at the risk of breaking other stuff.
2008-02-05T07:58:00.000Z	Malaz	Tonren	starcon 2 is released under the GPL, and has been ported to linux.
2008-02-05T07:58:00.000Z	Tonren	Malaz	Oh.  I hadn't heard of it.
2008-02-05T07:58:00.000Z	Malaz	Tonren	You must be new at everything to not have heard of starcon 2
2008-02-05T07:59:00.000Z	Tonren	Malaz	I haven't had the time to play a lot of games lately.
2008-02-05T07:59:00.000Z	Malaz	Tonren	It's not a 'lately' kind of game
2008-02-05T07:59:00.000Z	Malaz	Tonren	It's the kind of classic that should be mandatory to have a vote in any democratic system.  Kind of like the age of majority.
2008-02-05T08:00:00.000Z	Tonren	Malaz	Then you've played Master of Orion, as well.  :-)
2008-02-05T08:00:00.000Z	Malaz	Tonren	I wouldn't call myself a human being if I hadn't.  I played it so much it developed a crack and exploded in my computer
2008-02-05T08:00:00.000Z	Malaz	Tonren	Sadly I haven't played it since.
2008-02-05T08:01:00.000Z	Tonren	Malaz	Brilliant.  I'll see if I can fit in Star Control 2 sometime.
2008-02-05T08:01:00.000Z	Malaz	Tonren	It's an epic(ish) interstellar adventure game of massively epic proportions.  By the way, it is not affiliated with Starcon 3 in any way.  Ever.
