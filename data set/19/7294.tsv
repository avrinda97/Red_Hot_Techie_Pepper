2007-11-02T20:42:00.000Z	TiaGo|SouZa		basically, windows is not installling, after I installed gutsy
2007-11-02T20:42:00.000Z	TiaGo|SouZa		dunno why
2007-11-02T20:43:00.000Z	TiaGo|SouZa		yeah
2007-11-02T20:43:00.000Z	TiaGo|SouZa		I already tried to install ONLY windows, and that didnt happen
2007-11-02T20:43:00.000Z	TiaGo|SouZa		I erase everything, including gutsy
2007-11-02T20:44:00.000Z	TiaGo|SouZa		but windows dont install even when gutsy is not in my computer
2007-11-02T20:44:00.000Z	TiaGo|SouZa		even when Linux is not in mu computer
2007-11-02T20:45:00.000Z	TiaGo|SouZa		yes
2007-11-02T20:45:00.000Z	TiaGo|SouZa		the slow one format
2007-11-02T20:45:00.000Z	danielbw	TiaGo|SouZa	then you need help from a Windows channel
2007-11-02T20:45:00.000Z	TiaGo|SouZa		xp
2007-11-02T20:45:00.000Z	TiaGo|SouZa	danielbw	well, that happened after I installed gutsy
2007-11-02T20:46:00.000Z	TiaGo|SouZa		so I thought it would have something to do with NTFS writing that gutsy introduced
2007-11-02T20:46:00.000Z	danielbw	TiaGo|SouZa	if you have an empty partition table, then Windows install will work just fine.
2007-11-02T20:46:00.000Z	TiaGo|SouZa	danielbw	afteru gutsy, that stopped happening here
2007-11-02T20:46:00.000Z	danielbw	TiaGo|SouZa	have you tried doing the manufacturers drive low lever format?
2007-11-02T20:46:00.000Z	TiaGo|SouZa		ok
2007-11-02T20:47:00.000Z	danielbw	TiaGo|SouZa	have you tried doing the drive manufacturer's drive low level format?
