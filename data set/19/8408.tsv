2008-02-16T03:32:00.000Z	EnderTheThird		Is there  a better way to track CPU usage than System Monitor?  It's showing 100% usage in resources, but processes is showing jack for usage so I  don't know what's slowing this computer down
2008-02-16T03:33:00.000Z	EnderTheThird		gnome-panel's the culprit apparently.   odd.
2008-02-16T03:33:00.000Z	pike_	EnderTheThird	did you update today? ive seen several complaints about cpu usage in gnome-panel today
2008-02-16T03:34:00.000Z	EnderTheThird	pike_	yep.  haven't restarted yet because I'm SSH'd to my home PC.
2008-02-16T03:35:00.000Z	pike_	EnderTheThird	could have been a bug introduced sounds like
2008-02-16T03:35:00.000Z	EnderTheThird	pike_	 strange thing is that it's showing a different user than the one i'm actually logged in under.
2008-02-16T03:35:00.000Z	pike_	EnderTheThird	it should not
2008-02-16T03:36:00.000Z	pike_	EnderTheThird	if it is opened as another user anything it launches will have that users perm pref that should not be
2008-02-16T03:37:00.000Z	pike_	EnderTheThird	so ps aux | grep gnome-panel  shows a diff user?
2008-02-16T03:37:00.000Z	EnderTheThird		one sec
2008-02-16T03:42:00.000Z	EnderTheThird	pike_	 yeah, one of them is a different user
2008-02-16T03:43:00.000Z	EnderTheThird		can i manually log another user off from the CLI?
2008-02-16T03:44:00.000Z	EnderTheThird	pike_	 killing that user's processes brought my CPU usage back down.
2008-02-16T03:45:00.000Z	pike_	EnderTheThird	k. it should respawn did it?
2008-02-16T03:45:00.000Z	EnderTheThird	pike_	 no.  that user isn't (or shouldn't be) logged in right now
2008-02-16T03:46:00.000Z	EnderTheThird	pike_	 that user is set to auto-login though.  i wonder if that's part of the reason behind it after the update.  i'll need to see what happens after i restart
2008-02-16T03:47:00.000Z	pike_	EnderTheThird	i dont know but id xhost - just in case
2008-02-16T03:49:00.000Z	EnderTheThird	pike_	 i'm gonna restart and see if it pops up again
2008-02-16T04:07:00.000Z	EnderTheThird	pike_	 didn't have any trouble this time.  not sure what caused that, but i'm having normal cpu usage now
