2007-05-17T05:24:00.000Z	PepperBob	suchawato	have you tried to just boot it from live cd?
2007-05-17T05:26:00.000Z	PepperBob	suchawato	but you could boot into terminal only mode?
2007-05-17T05:27:00.000Z	PepperBob	suchawato	so you have a prompt is that what you saying=
2007-05-17T05:29:00.000Z	PepperBob	suchawato	don't got it.. can you boot into text mode, having a prompt? (without the graphical stuff)
2007-05-17T05:29:00.000Z	PepperBob	suchawato	damnit
2007-05-17T05:30:00.000Z	PepperBob	suchawato	can you pass additional kernel options? probably you should disable some hardware stuff which is performed automatically
2007-05-17T05:31:00.000Z	PepperBob	suchawato	iirc there are option to disable load of usb modules and other stuff.. i guess some of this is messing up the boot process...
