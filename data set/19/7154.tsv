2007-10-19T23:24:00.000Z	arghh2d2		does anyone know what's the average upgrade time upgrading to gutsy through update manager?  or care to share how long it took you personally?
2007-10-19T23:26:00.000Z	arghh2d2		Does anyones update manager hang on: "Fetching file 15 of 22"?  is that sposed to happen?
2007-10-19T23:26:00.000Z	Vlet	arghh2d2	no, it's not, but it's happening a lot since the relase. try switching mirrors
2007-10-20T09:41:00.000Z	Vlet	arghh2d2	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Fstab
2007-10-25T00:41:00.000Z	Vlet	arghh2d2	what are you trying to do?
2007-10-25T00:42:00.000Z	arghh2d2	Vlet	i'm just trying to change the login window, default color, automatic logon and it wont save the settings, also it crashes sometimes, even when i run it like: sudo gdmsetup
2007-10-25T00:46:00.000Z	Vlet	arghh2d2	are you on an upgraded system? sounds like you're having a lot of strange problems
2007-10-25T00:48:00.000Z	arghh2d2	Vlet	the only thing i can think of that caused this is upgrading the repos the way winehq.com says to do it to get the most recent version of wine for ubuntu 7.10 (wich still locks up btw, wine sucks)
2007-10-25T00:50:00.000Z	Vlet	arghh2d2	but are you on an upgraded version of gutsy, or a clean install? a lot of people have had strange problems with upgraded installs
2007-10-25T00:50:00.000Z	arghh2d2	Vlet	it only crashes when i try to change the 'welcome message' but it never saves the settings, i'm freeakin out because my g/f's mother is gonna freak if she has to login on this computer
2007-10-25T00:51:00.000Z	Vlet	arghh2d2	so instead, do this: ctfl-f2 and then type: gksudo gedit /etc/gdm/gdm.conf
2007-10-25T00:51:00.000Z	arghh2d2	Vlet	yes i am, but i had changed a few settings before the wine upgrade and they saved and worked fine,,,now that you mention it tho, there was the issue with default color reverting back to brown and not saving to my black prefernces
2007-10-25T00:51:00.000Z	Vlet	arghh2d2	and edit the message manually
2007-10-25T00:52:00.000Z	arghh2d2	Vlet	why does it have to be in a virt terminal?
2007-10-25T00:52:00.000Z	Vlet	arghh2d2	oops - replied to myself :)
2007-10-25T00:54:00.000Z	Vlet	arghh2d2	yeah, all those settings are in there.
2007-10-25T01:13:00.000Z	arghh2d2	Vlet	no luck, configuring gdmsetup by hand reaps the same results...this sucks, i shooda never updated
2007-10-25T19:06:00.000Z	Vlet	arghh2d2	du -h
