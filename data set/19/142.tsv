2012-08-16T07:14:00.000Z	soliloquy1		I just installed Ubuntu on my macbook air along with OS X Mountain Lion following this guide (https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MactelSupportTeam/AppleIntelInstallation). Install went fine, I booted into OS X fine after partition sync via refit as in directions; went to boot into Ubuntu and get this friendly error - "Missing Operating System". What in the world now?
2012-08-16T07:16:00.000Z	cfhowlett	soliloquy1	your ubuntu is likely still present, but the bootloader scrambled.  reinstall refit.
2012-08-16T07:16:00.000Z	soliloquy1	cfhowlett	alright, I'll try that now
2012-08-16T07:18:00.000Z	soliloquy1	cfhowlett	How would I install grub from the live cd without reinstalling Ubuntu?
2012-09-01T18:03:00.000Z	cfhowlett	soliloquy1	I can help.
2012-09-01T18:03:00.000Z	cfhowlett	soliloquy1	did it EVER work?  and what method did you use to install the driver?
2012-09-01T18:04:00.000Z	soliloquy1	cfhowlett	It did till 2 days ago. The driver came installed out of the box w/ ubuntu.
2012-09-01T18:05:00.000Z	soliloquy1	cfhowlett	Now it tries to connect for a long time, says its connected but then doesn't load pages
2012-09-01T18:05:00.000Z	cfhowlett	soliloquy1	try soliloquy1 NO pages anywhere or just some pages?
2012-09-01T18:05:00.000Z	soliloquy1	cfhowlett	no pages, anywhere
2012-09-01T18:06:00.000Z	cfhowlett	soliloquy1	ping www.google.com and 8.8.8.8
2012-09-01T18:07:00.000Z	cfhowlett	soliloquy1	if no response, suspect dns settings.  Sorry, but while I know how to install the broadcom drivers, I know nothing of DNS.
2012-09-01T18:12:00.000Z	soliloquy1	cfhowlett	the broadcom STA driver's enabled, unknown host for google, 8.8.8.8 got destination unreachable
2012-09-01T18:13:00.000Z	cfhowlett	soliloquy1	then you're not connected.  Try rebooting and also reinitialize the router if connected.
2012-09-01T18:14:00.000Z	soliloquy1	cfhowlett	I've done both over and over and over. it says I'm connected, but I'm clearly not. It can see the wifi network, though.
2012-09-01T18:15:00.000Z	cfhowlett	soliloquy1	DNS > over my head.  Stay in channel and ask patiently.
2012-09-01T18:16:00.000Z	cfhowlett	soliloquy1	oh, that's nice.  Blame the father!  :)
2012-09-01T18:16:00.000Z	cfhowlett	soliloquy1	but yeah, ask Dad about it.  Good luck.
2012-09-01T18:17:00.000Z	cfhowlett	soliloquy1	best of luck.
