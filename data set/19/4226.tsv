2009-02-28T21:47:00.000Z	BiGG_D		So uhh...   I was just wondering, whats the difference between running the alternate version install CD in text mode n' the server installer CD of ub 8.10 x64 ?
2009-02-28T21:48:00.000Z	BiGG_D		Anyone, Anyone ?
2009-02-28T21:49:00.000Z	BiGG_D		Uhh...   to see if anyone has an answer to the question I poised ?
2009-02-28T21:50:00.000Z	ilowe	BiGG_D	very little when running them
2009-02-28T21:50:00.000Z	ilowe	BiGG_D	The alternate install CD is for customization and OEM stuff in general. Your question was a bit vague.
2009-02-28T21:51:00.000Z	BiGG_D	ilowe	would it make any difference running one vs. the other in XenServer ?  I seem to be having some issues getting PV working...   :/
2009-02-28T21:51:00.000Z	ilowe	BiGG_D	shouldn't make any difference; can you run other ISO images?
2009-02-28T21:52:00.000Z	BiGG_D	ilowe	Yea, server build runs like a champ, but it seems as though cpu's are vpin'd and I'd like to run more than 2 virt instances on a dual core proc
2009-02-28T21:52:00.000Z	ilowe	BiGG_D	so what's the problem with the alt?
2009-02-28T21:54:00.000Z	ilowe	BiGG_D	The difference is mainly in the menuing system that's built into the CD image; the package structure of the base install is the same by default
2009-02-28T21:55:00.000Z	ilowe	BiGG_D	The real difference is with the desktop edition (and the K/X Ubuntu stuff)
2009-02-28T21:55:00.000Z	ilowe	BiGG_D	all your packages should be coming from the same place anyway aren't they?
2009-02-28T21:55:00.000Z	ilowe	BiGG_D	I mean, are you using a local apt cache?
2009-02-28T21:55:00.000Z	ilowe	BiGG_D	absolutely
2009-02-28T21:56:00.000Z	ilowe	BiGG_D	remember that intrepid won't run properly as a dom0 without a manually built kernel
2009-02-28T21:57:00.000Z	ilowe	BiGG_D	the kernel as of intrepid is supposed to contain the VT switches so it can run as domU
2009-02-28T21:58:00.000Z	ilowe	BiGG_D	pre-built intrepid is "supposed" to run as domU out of the box
2009-02-28T21:59:00.000Z	BiGG_D	ilowe	Yea...   thats what I always thought...
