2008-03-23T02:08:00.000Z	sap		Isn't there a way I can add a line to the repos for it to check for program updates when it is released (like I remember reading something similar for WINE ) ?
2008-03-23T02:09:00.000Z	gregory	sap	you can install a cron job
2008-03-23T02:10:00.000Z	sap	gregory	how do i install cron job? and what'll it do?
2008-03-23T02:11:00.000Z	gregory	sap	cron job is a meta facility to program your computer to do certain things on a fixed time. like a sceduler-calender program
2008-03-23T02:13:00.000Z	sap	gregory	umm.. I'm not sure if cron job can help me update some of my preferred applications automatically. can it??
2008-03-23T02:15:00.000Z	gregory	sap	not by itself. you would have to program it to call the update-manager program with the interval you choose (2 sec, 1 day, very flexible)
2008-03-23T02:16:00.000Z	sap	gregory	but can it update manually installed programs also like openoffice Pidgin etc?
2008-03-23T02:17:00.000Z	gregory	sap	manually installed programs - no. thats a limitation of the update manager. it only watches for debs designed for ubuntu
2008-03-23T02:18:00.000Z	sap	gregory	even if I had used "checkinstall" option when manually installing?
2008-03-23T02:19:00.000Z	gregory	sap	which program are you talking about exactly?
2008-03-23T02:19:00.000Z	sap	gregory	Pidgin and openoffice :)
2008-03-23T02:19:00.000Z	gregory	sap	sorry, which packet-manager-program are you talking about exactly?
2008-03-23T02:20:00.000Z	sap	gregory	u mean synaptic package manager (that's what I use)
2008-03-23T02:20:00.000Z	gregory	sap	yes
2008-03-23T02:20:00.000Z	sap	gregory	k
2008-03-23T02:23:00.000Z	gregory	sap	i cant find this option in the manpage and via ./program --help. generally: i recommend just sticking with the debian repos. they also provide fast updates. other then that you would have to use a different distro, which will not be as comfortable as ubuntu regarding user experience
2008-03-23T02:24:00.000Z	sap	gregory	hmm.. ok. well thanks for your efforts; will then stick to manual updates for now I guess , if necessary .
2008-03-23T02:24:00.000Z	gregory	sap	sorry, i meant stick with the ubuntu repos
2008-03-23T02:25:00.000Z	sap	gregory	k
