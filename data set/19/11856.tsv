2007-08-11T08:31:00.000Z	sorush20		does ubuntu come preinstalled with a webserver?
2007-08-11T08:31:00.000Z	dystopianray	sorush20	not the desktop version, but the server version does
2007-08-11T08:31:00.000Z	dystopianray	sorush20	ubuntu server can setup a LAMP server very easily
2007-08-11T08:32:00.000Z	sorush20	dystopianray	in the /var/www I have a file and when I type in localhost in the web browser I get a list of that directory
2007-08-11T08:33:00.000Z	dystopianray	sorush20	that suggests that you do have a web server
2007-08-11T08:34:00.000Z	dystopianray	sorush20	try this: $ sudo netstat -tlpn | grep 80
2007-08-11T08:35:00.000Z	dystopianray	sorush20	pike?
2007-08-11T08:37:00.000Z	dystopianray	sorush20	what is pike?
2007-08-11T08:42:00.000Z	sorush20	dystopianray	look at my paste
2007-08-11T08:42:00.000Z	dystopianray	sorush20	yes I can see it, but what is pike? something you insatlled?
2007-08-11T08:43:00.000Z	sorush20	dystopianray	don't know
2007-08-11T08:43:00.000Z	dystopianray	sorush20	well whatever it is, it seems to be some sort of webserver
2007-08-11T08:46:00.000Z	sorush20	dystopianray	it is a webserver..
2007-08-11T08:46:00.000Z	sorush20	dystopianray	its was somehow install by default.
2007-08-11T08:46:00.000Z	dystopianray	sorush20	it's not installed by default
2007-08-11T08:47:00.000Z	dystopianray	sorush20	unless you have an unofficial ubuntu release
2007-08-11T08:47:00.000Z	sorush20	dystopianray	I don't really know why it was running there..
2007-08-11T08:47:00.000Z	dystopianray	sorush20	it must have been something you installed
2007-08-11T08:47:00.000Z	dystopianray	sorush20	or a dependancy of something you installed
