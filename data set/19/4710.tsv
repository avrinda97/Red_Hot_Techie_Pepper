2010-03-11T07:44:00.000Z	hmw	chelz	the webcam shows up in dmesg apperently
2010-04-07T08:59:00.000Z	hmw	chelz	some graphic adaptors dont start compiz. I always check for either the shadows, or if moving the mouse wheel over the desktop results in an animation.
2010-04-19T09:12:00.000Z	hmw	chelz	not in Ubuntu nor WinXP
2010-04-19T09:11:00.000Z	chelz	hmw	really make sure there's something wrong with it before messing with the fs
2010-04-19T09:12:00.000Z	hmw	chelz	it wont mount anymore
2010-04-19T09:12:00.000Z	chelz	hmw	what message do you get when you try to mount it in the terminal? (please pastebin)
2010-04-19T09:12:00.000Z	hmw	chelz	i must specify the file system type
2010-04-19T09:12:00.000Z	chelz	hmw	what does partition editor / gparted say about it?
2010-04-19T09:16:00.000Z	chelz	hmw	mount -t vfat /dev/sda1 /mnt/
2010-04-19T09:17:00.000Z	chelz	hmw	but do it for the message it puts out to pastebin the message it puts out
2010-04-19T09:33:00.000Z	chelz	hmw	search that wiki thing for gpart
2010-04-19T09:33:00.000Z	chelz	hmw	not gparted but gpart
2010-04-19T09:34:00.000Z	chelz	hmw	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DataRecovery#GNU%20Parted
2010-04-19T09:36:00.000Z	chelz	hmw	have backups?
2010-04-19T09:36:00.000Z	hmw	chelz	yes, its only 50% ugly. I want to find out, what happened and see, if i can prevent it from happening again, mainly.
2010-04-19T09:42:00.000Z	chelz	hmw	dd it then run gpart over the dd'd img
2010-04-19T09:44:00.000Z	hmw	chelz	lol... hm... i'd love to, but... 1TB --> 250GB wont work, i fear. I will look closer to my logs later, and after that will try to run gpart on the original drive due to lack of hardware.
2010-04-19T10:23:00.000Z	chelz	hmw	if you give it a range it'll work faster
