2010-06-14T07:37:00.000Z	h3nry		i am trying to set up CUDA on Ubuntu 9.1. I need to install the nVidia dev drivers, which requires me to exit the gui. So I enter "sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop" in a terminal, and the computer locks up
2010-06-14T07:37:00.000Z	h3nry		any suggestions?
2010-06-14T07:38:00.000Z	h3nry		im not much of a linux power user. how do i get to recovery mode?
2010-06-14T07:39:00.000Z	bobthemilkman	h3nry	There is no recovery mode. If you need administrative properties, use sudo, or sudo -s. If you broke your GUI, drop into a TTY with alt+F1-F6. If you really messed up your system, pop in a live-CD and then chroot into your system.
2010-06-14T07:40:00.000Z	bobthemilkman	h3nry	Use alt+F1 to drop into a TTY
2010-06-14T07:41:00.000Z	bobthemilkman	h3nry	 errr, ctrl+alt+F1
2010-06-14T07:41:00.000Z	bobthemilkman	h3nry	(Specifically, leftctrl+leftalt+F1
2010-06-14T07:42:00.000Z	h3nry	bobthemilkman	i just did that, and it did something, but didnt take to to a tty
2010-06-14T07:42:00.000Z	h3nry	bobthemilkman	i still see the terminal window, but the area where the desktop was went black, the cursor is flashing but it is not recognizing my keystrokes
2010-06-14T07:43:00.000Z	h3nry	bobthemilkman	i am running this in a sun/oracle VirtualBox VM in Win7. Perhaps its a display issue when I leave the gui?
2010-06-14T07:43:00.000Z	h3nry	bobthemilkman	ctrl+alt+f7 took me back into the gui with no problems
2010-06-14T07:44:00.000Z	bobthemilkman	h3nry	The easier solution to your problem is sudo apt-get install nvidia-current-dev
2010-06-14T07:45:00.000Z	h3nry	bobthemilkman	it just says couldn't find package nvidia-current-dev
2010-06-14T07:46:00.000Z	bobthemilkman	h3nry	Hold up, I'm gonna cancel my X session so I can give you an exact answer.
2010-06-14T07:46:00.000Z	h3nry	bobthemilkman	and the getting started guide found at http://developer.nvidia.com/object/cuda_3_0_downloads.html says to use "sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop"
2010-06-14T07:46:00.000Z	bobthemilkman	h3nry	Gotta go to lunch!
2010-06-14T07:47:00.000Z	h3nry	bobthemilkman	fair enough. thanks for the help so far!
2010-06-14T07:47:00.000Z	bobthemilkman	h3nry	Anyway, you might need to install *other* video card drivers first, and then drop to TTY1, and then do the installation from there.
2010-06-14T07:48:00.000Z	h3nry	bobthemilkman	ok. its late here, so maybe i'll fight with this tomorrow (when i can consult with some of my more linux-savvy friends)
