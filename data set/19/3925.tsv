2009-05-03T03:42:00.000Z	apot	tdizzy	does the rear audio jack like it it you unplug the headphones in the front?
2009-05-03T03:42:00.000Z	tdizzy	apot	are you asking if the back analog jacks work? if so, yes they do
2009-05-03T03:43:00.000Z	apot	tdizzy	can the sound system power up?
2009-05-03T03:44:00.000Z	apot		going though A+ troubleshooting...
2009-05-03T03:44:00.000Z	tdizzy	apot	yes. it appears that the problem I am having is that the optical/digital device is not showing anywhere
2009-05-03T03:45:00.000Z	apot		hmm, if this is under ubuntu, i cant help you install drivers, which is what i would assume your problem is
2009-05-03T03:48:00.000Z	tdizzy	apot	do you know how I might fix my problem?
2009-05-03T03:49:00.000Z	tdizzy		can anyone help me with my optical audio problems?
2009-05-03T03:49:00.000Z	apot		based on what information i have, i would guess that your sound system needs drivers that aren't installed yet
2009-05-03T03:50:00.000Z	apot		if it powers up and the audio port tests to be working properly
2009-05-03T03:50:00.000Z	tdizzy	apot	would I need different drivers for digital capability than for analog?
2009-05-03T03:50:00.000Z	tdizzy	apot	analog devices work fine, but it's the digital one that does not
2009-05-03T03:52:00.000Z	apot	tdizzy	circumstantially, i would say you need different drivers, other possible though improbable causes would be lacking OS, hardware, or firmware support
2009-05-03T03:53:00.000Z	tdizzy	apot	so I do need additional drivers for optical audio support?
2009-05-03T03:54:00.000Z	apot	tdizzy	i wouldnt say additional, just different. I hope you have documentation for your audio device.
2009-05-03T03:56:00.000Z	tdizzy	apot	I found the proper ALSA drivers for my card. I'm entirely sure they're correct. I just can't seem get the optical audio to work. Unless I need a different driver for digital than for analog, my driver is correct.
2009-05-03T04:05:00.000Z	apot	tdizzy	alright I've looked around for a bit and think your problem is related to TOSlink. I havent worked with optical audio before. However, the usual beginning point for solving hardware issues is to make sure your hardware is recognized by your OS
