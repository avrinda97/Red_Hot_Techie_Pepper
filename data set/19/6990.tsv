2007-10-27T12:20:00.000Z	eido_		can someone help me to configure compiz-fusion, I installed the compiz-setting manager so I could customize the options, the graphic card i'm using is a radeon mobility m6 I set the desktops to 4 and tried replacing with emerald but neither emerald or compiz is working...fresh 7.10 install
2007-10-27T12:21:00.000Z	eido_		I also turned on all third party sources but compiz is not working
2007-10-27T12:21:00.000Z	dystopianray	eido_	what video card do you have?
2007-10-27T12:22:00.000Z	eido_	dystopianray	radeon mobility m6
2007-10-27T12:23:00.000Z	dystopianray	eido_	are you using the radeon or fglrx driver?
2007-10-27T12:23:00.000Z	eido_	dystopianray	xorg reads ATI Tech Radeon Mobility M6 Driver: ati
2007-10-27T12:24:00.000Z	dystopianray	eido_	and what driver is it using?
2007-10-27T12:24:00.000Z	eido_	dystopianray	sorry how can I determine that
2007-10-27T12:25:00.000Z	dystopianray	eido_	grep Driver /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2007-10-27T12:26:00.000Z	eido_	dystopianray	output reads; "kdb" "mouse" "synaptics" "wacom" &"ati"
2007-10-27T12:27:00.000Z	dystopianray	eido_	do you get 3d acceleration with that driver? I think it should run compiz
2007-10-27T12:28:00.000Z	eido_	dystopianray	sorry how can I determine that....it did not give an option for restricted drivers on my video card just for my modem
2007-10-27T12:28:00.000Z	dystopianray	eido_	your card is probably much too old for fglrx
2007-10-27T12:28:00.000Z	dystopianray	eido_	glxinfo | grep direct
2007-10-27T12:29:00.000Z	eido_	dystopianray	output is yes for direct rendering
2007-10-27T12:29:00.000Z	dystopianray	eido_	i think it should work with compiz then
2007-10-27T12:29:00.000Z	eido_	dystopianray	I had compiz-fusion working on 7.04
2007-10-27T12:30:00.000Z	eido_	dystopianray	none of the settings are taking effect in compiz settings manager
2007-10-27T12:31:00.000Z	dystopianray	eido_	i can't help much more, I don't use compiz or ati hardware
