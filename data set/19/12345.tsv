2005-09-19T13:29:00.000Z	vbgunz		I understand... I am slowly building rebel blood
2005-09-19T13:29:00.000Z	vbgunz		totem didn't play my MPGs
2005-09-19T13:30:00.000Z	vbgunz		I tried xine but it kept locking up my disk drive
2005-09-19T13:30:00.000Z	vbgunz		I've got to read up on that, thanks for the pointer bob2
2005-09-19T13:31:00.000Z	vbgunz		I just want to keep my Ubuntu legit... I want to see why it is so popular without trying to break the rules...
2005-09-19T13:31:00.000Z	vbgunz		I have a real dvd player, a ps2, etc... I don't game much and if I was bored to death I'd boot into windows
2005-09-19T13:31:00.000Z	vbgunz		:)
2005-09-19T13:32:00.000Z	vbgunz		on my second day I followed the unofficial guide a bit and installed all those restricted formats but I left the backports open in the config and before I knew it I had updates conflicting... I heard someone the other day say something like "when you done, comment it out" I'll do that next time
2005-09-19T13:34:00.000Z	vbgunz		can someone please help me somehow boot into my USB drive... I have an installation of Ubuntu on there and I am hoping to get into it... I need to somehow boot from CD and then from CD point to the USB drive and boot up. Only problem is my USB drive is not bootable and so why I am asking to boot from CD... i need the USB initialized otherwise no go... Any help would be greatly appreciatedz12
2005-09-19T13:35:00.000Z	vbgunz		nah, but even if I could "which I can't, emachines played me good" I would like to know if it is possible to boot into the USB drive from a bootable CD/DVD... the reason is i wish to take Ubuntu with me and not everyone such as myself will have such an option in the BIOS
2005-09-19T13:36:00.000Z	draug_n	vbgunz	maybe http://rz-obrian.rz.uni-karlsruhe.de/knoppix-usb/ could give u some hints?
2005-09-19T14:07:00.000Z	draug_n	vbgunz	remember looking into that myself some tmie go.. *checking google*
2005-09-19T14:09:00.000Z	draug_n	vbgunz	try here for ideas :http://fuzzymunchkin.dyndns.org:8080/tdot/usbkeyfob/index.php
2005-09-19T14:10:00.000Z	draug_n	vbgunz	this you brobably need as well (to make the usb disk bootable without resorting to windows): http://syslinux.zytor.com/
2005-09-19T14:13:00.000Z	draug_n	vbgunz	try going into bios setup _with_ the usb disk plugged in. it might help.  I cannot select usb hdd as boot device without doing that myself.
2005-09-19T14:14:00.000Z	draug_n	vbgunz	oh well
2005-09-19T14:19:00.000Z	draug_n	vbgunz	if u want a bootable floppyt with usb mass storage, you need to make a cunstom boot image with the following modules: usbcore, usb_storage, ehci/uhci/ohci_hcd and sd_mod (think that is enough). try 'man mkinitrd' for help on maing costom initrd's :)
2005-09-19T14:21:00.000Z	draug_n	vbgunz	http://lists.debian.org/debian-boot/2004/11/msg01601.html might help too...
2005-09-19T14:22:00.000Z	draug_n	vbgunz	hint: the key file to edit is /etc/mkinitrd/modules :)
