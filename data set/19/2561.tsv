2010-03-07T04:31:00.000Z	brjann	Jon-	i understand your frustration. let me see if I can figure out why it's ignoring that particular combo
2010-03-07T04:23:00.000Z	brjann	Jon-	go to System > Preferences > Appearance > Interface tab and check the "editable menu shortcut keys" box
2010-03-07T04:23:00.000Z	brjann	Jon-	and let me know when you're ready for the next step
2010-03-07T04:24:00.000Z	Jon-	brjann	Ready
2010-03-07T04:25:00.000Z	brjann	Jon-	okay. open up three tabs and select the center one (this is so the forward and backward tab menu options light up in the Tabs menu)
2010-03-07T04:25:00.000Z	brjann	Jon-	sorry, three tabs in a file browser window
2010-03-07T04:26:00.000Z	Jon-	brjann	done
2010-03-07T04:27:00.000Z	brjann	Jon-	this is where it gets weird. open the Tabs menu and hover the mouse over the shortcut key combo you wish to change. then just hit the new combination on the keyboard, and it should change.
2010-03-07T04:27:00.000Z	Jon-	brjann	Not working.
2010-03-07T04:28:00.000Z	brjann	Jon-	what was the keystroke combo you wanted to set?
2010-03-07T04:28:00.000Z	Jon-	brjann	ctrl + tab forward, ctrl + shift + tab backward.
2010-03-07T04:29:00.000Z	brjann	Jon-	huh, that's weird. ctrl+tab doesn't work -- but all manner of other shortcuts do :(
2010-03-07T04:29:00.000Z	Jon-	brjann	It works for other key combinations. I am not allowed to use tab...
2010-03-07T04:29:00.000Z	Jon-	brjann	Shit like this that makes me give up on ubuntu every time I try to switch.
2010-03-07T04:32:00.000Z	Jon-	brjann	Okay. I am going to be eating dinner so you can type full instructions here and I will get to them when I get back. If something happens to our connection, I just msg you my email address you can reach me by. Thanks.
2010-03-07T04:32:00.000Z	brjann	Jon-	sure thing
2010-03-07T05:24:00.000Z	Jon-	brjann	Does & work for every application?
2010-03-07T05:25:00.000Z	brjann	Jon-	yep, more or less
2010-03-07T05:26:00.000Z	brjann	Jon-	things do get a little ugly when the application insists on writing to stdout or stderr, so sometimes you'll have to redirect their output to /dev/null or a file to keep from getting spammed by text from backgrounded processes
