2009-01-19T07:11:00.000Z	Gobby		How do you switch from the GUI to CLI? I'm full of questions, sorry :)
2009-01-19T07:11:00.000Z	Gobby		Like in the terminal?

2009-01-19T07:14:00.000Z	Gobby		In the terminal, what is the command so i can just look at everything text based?.. Unless this is the same thing as my CLI question
2009-01-19T07:14:00.000Z	Gobby		So i can like browse the internet etc from there
2009-01-19T07:15:00.000Z	runderwo	Gobby	elinks is a terminal based web browser.
2009-01-19T07:17:00.000Z	runderwo	Gobby	Use irssi for irc, imcom for IM, etc.
2009-01-19T08:13:00.000Z	runderwo	Gobby	It's possible
2009-01-19T08:13:00.000Z	Gobby	runderwo	what are the chances?
2009-01-19T08:14:00.000Z	runderwo	Gobby	42.6971%
2009-01-19T08:14:00.000Z	runderwo	Gobby	Seriously, the worst that can usually happen is that it deletes all your user's files and starts some network service.
2009-01-19T08:14:00.000Z	runderwo	Gobby	Which is pretty bad.
2009-01-19T08:16:00.000Z	runderwo	Gobby	sudo apt-get install clamav.  But remember it's not a resident scanner, so you'll have to invoke it manually to scan a windows file.
2009-01-19T08:17:00.000Z	runderwo	Gobby	If I'm around :)
