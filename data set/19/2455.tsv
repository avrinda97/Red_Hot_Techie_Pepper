2010-03-30T11:51:00.000Z	Avasz		it worked fine when i had ubuntu 9.04.. i found the driver in system-->administration-->hardware dirivers
2010-03-30T11:52:00.000Z	Avasz		maybe i can install it from synaptic.
2010-03-30T11:53:00.000Z	rww	Avasz	were the ones you installed in 9.04 the Broadcom STA ones?
2010-03-30T11:53:00.000Z	Avasz	rww	same laptop.
2010-03-30T11:53:00.000Z	Avasz	rww	i am installing from synaptic... i think it works.
2010-03-30T11:57:00.000Z	rww	Avasz	you want bcmwl-kernel-source and b43-fwcutter
2010-03-30T11:58:00.000Z	Avasz	rww	shall i install bfw-fwcutter?
2010-03-30T11:58:00.000Z	rww	Avasz	you should install bcmwl-kernel-source and b43-fwcutter
2010-03-30T11:59:00.000Z	rww	Avasz	b43-fwcutter is the firmware installer for B43 cards.
2010-11-24T11:28:00.000Z	rww	Avasz	try D0AFF96872D340A3
2010-11-24T11:28:00.000Z	rww	Avasz	In the future, you should probably use add-apt-repository command instead of adding the line manually.
2011-05-26T20:05:00.000Z	rww	Avasz	difficult and unsupported
2011-05-26T20:06:00.000Z	Avasz	rww	so instead of downgrading xorg it would be better to use the older version itself?
2011-05-26T20:06:00.000Z	rww	Avasz	if you care about difficulty and unsupportedness, yes.
2011-05-26T20:07:00.000Z	Avasz	rww	ok. thanks. xorg from ubuntu 9.04 is not supported for my laptop.
