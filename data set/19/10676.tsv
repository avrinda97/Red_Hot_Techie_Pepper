2006-05-27T10:16:00.000Z	Heath		Hey can someone try connecting to me through my port 80?
2006-05-27T10:16:00.000Z	Heath		All you need is an internet window up
2006-05-27T10:17:00.000Z	Heath		http://192.168.0.4/ Could someone see if they can get on that?
2006-05-27T10:17:00.000Z	Heath		Yes
2006-05-27T10:17:00.000Z	Heath		Apache2
2006-05-27T10:18:00.000Z	Heath		Yes
2006-05-27T10:18:00.000Z	Heath		How can I access it from a different computer then?
2006-05-27T10:18:00.000Z	bk	Heath	what kind of router are you using?
2006-05-27T10:19:00.000Z	bk	Heath	open up a web browser and go to address http://192.168.0.1
2006-05-27T10:19:00.000Z	bk	Heath	that should take you to your router's configuration menu
2006-05-27T10:19:00.000Z	Heath	bk	Yep I know
2006-05-27T10:19:00.000Z	Heath	bk	Then what?
2006-05-27T10:20:00.000Z	bk	Heath	in there there should be something called Virtual Server or something
2006-05-27T10:20:00.000Z	Heath	bk	only server I see in advanced settings is DHCP Server
2006-05-27T10:20:00.000Z	bk	Heath	that allows you to connect to your computer when someone puts in your IP address.
2006-05-27T10:22:00.000Z	bk	Heath	according to the user list, your IP is 71.32.131.251.  If someone tried to ssh into it and you had your router set up correctly, you could get into your computer remotely.
2006-05-27T10:24:00.000Z	bk	Heath	do you know how i know?  Look at the user list to the right of this program.
2006-05-27T10:24:00.000Z	Heath	bk	I can't see it..
2006-05-27T10:24:00.000Z	Heath	bk	I can't see the user list
