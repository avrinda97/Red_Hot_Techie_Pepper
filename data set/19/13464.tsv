2005-07-01T14:33:00.000Z	george_	slept	why do you want ndiswrapper...that implicitly supports the rich that ruthlessly exploit the poor...MS has billions of dollars...how much do you have?
2005-07-01T14:33:00.000Z	george_	slept	you are supporting the people that work with MS and write MS drivers.
2005-07-01T14:34:00.000Z	george_	slept	you need to support the people that starve and work for freedom instead of money
2005-07-01T14:35:00.000Z	slept	george_	I don't want it , I don't need it , slow down with your fear for expliotion . I'm trying to give suport and if I tell buy an other card who has to pay , not the rich .
2005-07-01T14:36:00.000Z	george_	slept	well i would not even mention ndiswrapper because it supports the rich instead of the poor
2005-07-01T14:37:00.000Z	slept	george_	no it supports the people who can afford to buy an other card , are these people rich ? No. So they won't have acess to the internet . If you do so you achieved the opposit of what you wanted to.
2005-07-01T14:43:00.000Z	slept	george_	what is it , free software is not about hate and ignorance , if you made the mistake of buying a not supported card you shouldn't be punished. With your attitude you close doors to freesoftware,
2005-07-01T14:44:00.000Z	george_	slept	no....you have the free GNU compiler and the freedom to write your own driver for the hardware you already have...and in the future don'
2005-07-01T14:47:00.000Z	slept	george_	people who aren't able to get use to linux might not be capable of reverse engeneering . Give them a chance to get started with easier things. But I agree to not buy MS products or hardware thats not supported :)
2005-07-01T14:48:00.000Z	george_	slept	if people would get started writing their own drivers with GNU software and freely distribute them to others...then this improves free software not closes free software.
2005-07-01T14:49:00.000Z	george_	slept	we have always had an acronym since day 1....don't help these bastards take the easy road....tell them to RTFM
2005-07-01T14:50:00.000Z	george_	slept	otherwise you get computers that say "Intel on the Inside" and implicitly "Idiot on the outside"
2005-07-01T14:51:00.000Z	george_	slept	because Intel has billions of dollars...how much do you have?
2005-07-01T14:51:00.000Z	slept	george_	  Of course it improves free software .  Are you kernel developer ?
2005-07-01T14:52:00.000Z	george_	slept	sometimes i patch a few things...but i for sure did not write the DRM patch in 2.6.12...that was IBM...again the rich
2005-07-01T14:55:00.000Z	slept	george_	I care about ethics. But if a had bouth non supported hardware and I'm not able to develop the driver. Then I decide to buy a new card , who gets the mony? It's not me . It's an other company having billons of ... .
2005-07-01T14:57:00.000Z	george_	slept	well don't buy their hardware if they will not give out all the secret microcode and firmware and layout designs according to the Free Hardware Foundation princiiples.
2005-07-01T14:57:00.000Z	george_	slept	that way anybody could get the info and call a low labor cost fab in China or India and put them all out of business
2005-07-01T15:04:00.000Z	slept	george_	I know to look for supported hardware, because I'm already on linux and gnu. But if you try to switch from microsoft to linux and you didn't knew about nonfree things . But now you try to break the circle and switch to the free world, improve things .... But suddenly george_  appears and tells you that you should buy things for not making other people richer.  Don't you think that george_ isn't any better than microsoft ? The idea of free softw
