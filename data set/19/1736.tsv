2010-10-15T10:02:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	durranee	testdisk is your friend.
2010-10-15T10:05:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	durranee	You're not on that machine now, are you?
2010-10-15T10:06:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	durranee	In what OS?
2010-10-15T10:09:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	durranee	http://www.ontrackdatarecovery.com/file-recovery-software/ is supposedly decent for Windows.
2010-10-15T10:09:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	durranee	Good luck.
2010-10-15T10:10:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	durranee	About $500-$1K if you get stuck and want someone else to do it for you professionally.  These are legitimate companies, not "people on IRC."
2010-10-15T10:11:00.000Z	durranee	KB1JWQ	i do remember buying a program a few years ago that helped me recver data, but that time no OS was installed
2010-10-15T10:55:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	durranee	Won't work.
2010-10-15T10:55:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	durranee	Your partitions are hosed, or so you told us.  You need something that'll scrape the platters.
