2005-09-16T06:56:00.000Z	firez		Does anyone here use openbox or fluxbox?, I can't use anything when I install any of them
2005-09-16T06:58:00.000Z	dabaR	firez	I use openbox, as well.
2005-09-16T06:59:00.000Z	dabaR	firez	off course, use the right click
2005-09-16T07:00:00.000Z	dabaR	firez	right click on the desktop.
2005-09-16T07:01:00.000Z	dabaR	firez	how come you chose to use openbox?
2005-09-16T07:02:00.000Z	dabaR	firez	why did you decide to go openbox?
2005-09-16T07:02:00.000Z	dabaR	firez	so you want gnome to use openbox?
2005-09-16T07:05:00.000Z	dabaR	firez	to set up gnome to use openbox instead of metacity...you need to edit the configuration manager...
2005-09-16T07:07:00.000Z	dabaR	firez	no, you still want to use gnome, as I understand, you just want a different wm. Anyone recommend him to use openbox over enlightenment?
2005-09-16T07:08:00.000Z	dabaR	firez	exactly.
2005-09-16T07:09:00.000Z	dabaR	firez	you are using the default gnome, that uses metacity as the wm.
2005-09-16T07:09:00.000Z	dabaR	firez	you can specify, through the config manager, in APps>System Tools in gnome, to use something else.
2005-09-16T07:09:00.000Z	dabaR	firez	for example, that openbox.
2005-09-16T07:10:00.000Z	dabaR	firez	on the forums, there is stuff about enlightenment which is a common replacement for metacity.
2005-09-16T07:22:00.000Z	dabaR	firez	that is how they work...
2005-09-16T07:22:00.000Z	dabaR	firez	they are minimal, so you can add stuff to them...
2005-09-16T07:23:00.000Z	dabaR	firez	not at all.
2005-09-16T07:23:00.000Z	dabaR	firez	those things are edited through config files.
2005-09-16T07:24:00.000Z	dabaR	firez	I can show you how to ecit the config file for openbox, and there is a #fluxbox.
