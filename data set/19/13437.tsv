2005-04-02T06:23:00.000Z	akk		Hmm, the hoary installer set my user password wrong and wouldn't let me log in.
2005-04-02T06:23:00.000Z	akk		I had to ctl-alt-F2 and log in as root to fix it.
2005-04-02T06:24:00.000Z	DsOft	akk	i think it didnt set up root password
2005-04-02T06:24:00.000Z	DsOft		in user account u shoull do sudo passwd root
2005-04-02T06:24:00.000Z	akk	DsOft	My root password was right, but it wouldn't let me log in with that from the X screen.
2005-04-02T06:25:00.000Z	DsOft		maybe u cant use X-windows in root account
2005-04-02T06:25:00.000Z	DsOft		not too much distros had able that
2005-04-02T06:25:00.000Z	akk	DsOft	Yeah, but it's kind of a problem if it didn't set my user password correctly either.
2005-04-02T06:26:00.000Z	DsOft		u cant set up a new passwd with sudo passwd root?
2005-04-02T06:26:00.000Z	akk	DsOft	It's hard to set up anything without first logging in.  I couldn't log in except from the ctl-alt-f2 console.
2005-04-02T06:26:00.000Z	DsOft		on console
2005-04-02T06:27:00.000Z	DsOft		u are at user account?
2005-04-02T06:27:00.000Z	DsOft		it ask u to log, log in as normal user
2005-04-02T06:27:00.000Z	akk	DsOft	It wouldn't let me log in as the user account.  It didn't set the password correctly during install.
2005-04-02T06:27:00.000Z	DsOft		i thought it was the root passed
2005-04-02T06:27:00.000Z	DsOft		root passw
2005-04-02T06:28:00.000Z	DsOft		if user passwd isnt set fine, u should reinstall
2005-04-02T06:28:00.000Z	DsOft		not user and root accounts, big problem
2005-04-02T06:28:00.000Z	akk	DsOft	I just got through my second install, I'd really rather not reinstall a third time.
