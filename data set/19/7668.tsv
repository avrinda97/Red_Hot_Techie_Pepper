2007-07-16T09:54:00.000Z	Seoke		Anyone know why I keep getting E: mldonkey-server: subprocess post-installation script returned error exit status 1 when I install things with synaptic?
2007-07-16T09:55:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Seoke	HAve you made any changes to your sources list
2007-07-16T09:56:00.000Z	Seoke	Jack_Sparrow	I dont think so is there anyway to change that file back to default in case I have?
2007-07-16T09:56:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Seoke	YEs, easy to edit..
2007-07-16T09:57:00.000Z	Seoke	Jack_Sparrow	Thanks
2007-07-16T09:57:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Seoke	HAve you used scripts to install anything.. they change sources..
2007-07-16T09:58:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Seoke	Which scripts did you use?
2007-07-16T09:58:00.000Z	Seoke	Jack_Sparrow	Cant remember exactly
2007-07-16T10:00:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Seoke	automatix and envy are BAD tools
2007-07-16T10:00:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Seoke	Try replacing your source list and see if that helps
2007-07-16T10:03:00.000Z	Seoke	Jack_Sparrow	Still pops up but its not doing anything bad its still letting me install apps its just an annoyance I can deal with it
2007-07-19T06:47:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Seoke	try and sell your copy of XP..:)
2007-07-19T06:47:00.000Z	Seoke	Jack_Sparrow	You mean my ripped copy? xDD
2007-07-19T06:56:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Seoke	Call one of your buddies, they always help their team
2007-07-19T06:56:00.000Z	Seoke	Jack_Sparrow	They live where I'm trying to get xD that would be pointless
2007-07-19T06:57:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Seoke	This is all off topic, but one of them will come get you..
2007-07-19T06:57:00.000Z	Seoke	Jack_Sparrow	They live 3 hours away in the same town as my unit xD
2007-07-19T06:58:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Seoke	So much for planning ahead.. No one here can help and again.. this is off topic... although we feel for your situation..
2007-07-19T06:59:00.000Z	Seoke	Jack_Sparrow	Wasnt asking for help xD Just needed somewhere to vent and this was the first IRC channel open xDD
