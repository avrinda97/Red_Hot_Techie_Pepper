2006-06-18T07:44:00.000Z	eclypse		sup everyone
2006-06-18T07:45:00.000Z	eclypse		the alternate cd can fix a hellovalot of problems
2006-06-18T07:45:00.000Z	eclypse		Its pretty much the safest install route.
2006-06-18T07:46:00.000Z	eclypse		anyone know how to fix the xserver error 'no screens found'? I've been attempting to get XGL working and this seems to be the main error at the moment.
2006-06-18T07:47:00.000Z	mister_roboto	eclypse	i've had that error  when i used the wrong video driver and the x server couldn't talk to the card.  have you looked at your xorg log?
2006-06-18T07:49:00.000Z	mister_roboto	eclypse	oh... i keyed in on the error message and not the XGL part. I have not used XGL at all. I do know that it's generally a good idea though to see what sort of things the software is trying to tell you  in the logs :)
2006-06-18T07:49:00.000Z	mister_roboto	eclypse	/var/log
2006-06-18T07:50:00.000Z	mister_roboto	eclypse	frequently you'll find useful stuff written to /var/log/messages too. check the timestamps to see what files got new information
2006-06-18T07:51:00.000Z	mister_roboto	eclypse	"ls -lrt" will sort the files with the most recently modified ones at the bottom
2006-06-18T07:52:00.000Z	mister_roboto	eclypse	sure
2006-06-18T07:54:00.000Z	eclypse	mister_roboto	http://pastebin.com/715795
2006-06-18T07:57:00.000Z	mister_roboto	eclypse	is that all there is? looks like it got cut off
2006-06-18T07:57:00.000Z	mister_roboto	eclypse	i don't know what all those drmOpenDevice failures means... sorry
2006-06-18T08:00:00.000Z	eclypse	mister_roboto	http://pastebin.com/715798
2006-06-18T08:02:00.000Z	mister_roboto	eclypse	i'm sorry but that looks like everything initialized fine with respect to your card. i don't know xgl or what can go wrong with it so i can't help you further. hopefully someone else will take up your problem
2006-06-18T08:04:00.000Z	mister_roboto	eclypse	well... do you NEED xgl?  :)
2006-06-18T08:04:00.000Z	mister_roboto	eclypse	why? i'm curious why you want it so badly
2006-06-18T08:05:00.000Z	mister_roboto	eclypse	but why is that important to using your laptop, apart from the coolness factor?
2006-06-18T08:05:00.000Z	mister_roboto	eclypse	are you sure about that? i havfe a radeon mobility in this laptop and performance is very very good with the ati driver
