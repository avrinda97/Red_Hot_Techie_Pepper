2010-05-02T16:07:00.000Z	Tecna		My mouse cursor just disappeared.  Is there a way to restart the mouse-related stuff without having to restart the whole system?
2010-05-02T16:07:00.000Z	airtonix	Tecna	you mean apart from logging out ?
2010-05-02T16:09:00.000Z	airtonix	Tecna	first thing i'd try is killing gnome-panel then nautilus.
2010-05-02T16:09:00.000Z	Tecna	airtonix	Alright, trying now.
2010-05-02T16:10:00.000Z	airtonix	Tecna	i assume youknow how.
2010-05-02T16:10:00.000Z	Tecna	airtonix	yes
2010-05-02T16:12:00.000Z	Tecna	airtonix	gnome-pannel and nautilus have been killed, but still no mouse
2010-05-02T16:12:00.000Z	airtonix	Tecna	ok next thing is to restart metacity
2010-05-02T16:13:00.000Z	airtonix	Tecna	(assuming its your current window manager )
2010-05-02T16:14:00.000Z	Tecna	airtonix	I don't think it is.  let me see if it's in my ps -e
2010-05-02T16:14:00.000Z	Tecna	airtonix	Metacity's not running
2010-05-02T16:15:00.000Z	airtonix	Tecna	do you know which window manager you're using ?
2010-05-02T16:16:00.000Z	Tecna	airtonix	I'm using compiz.  I'm not sure that that's really the window manager.
2010-05-02T16:17:00.000Z	airtonix	Tecna	correct. most people call it one. but its only a compositor.. the window manager for compiz by default is gnome-window-decorator or something.
2010-05-02T16:17:00.000Z	Tecna	airtonix	I think my task has finished on its own.  I'm just going to restart GDM
2010-05-02T16:26:00.000Z	Tecna	airtonix	I'm a freaking moron.  The batteries in my mouse were dead.  I didn't think to check them because the cursor usually gets jumpy before completely dying.
2010-05-02T16:26:00.000Z	airtonix	Tecna	i just assumed you already checked that. (wired mouse ftw)
2010-05-02T16:28:00.000Z	Tecna	airtonix	I keep a wired mouse nearby in case I'm caught without batteries, but i didn't consider being caught without brains.
2010-05-02T17:04:00.000Z	Tecna	airtonix	monophonics, mononucleosis, or monorails?
