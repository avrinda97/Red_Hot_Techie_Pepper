2007-04-30T09:46:00.000Z	underwatercow		is there a way to see the list of users in a channel?
2007-04-30T09:48:00.000Z	underwatercow		is it true that Linux is a hacker's OS? If so, what makes it so? :-p
2007-04-30T09:49:00.000Z	yigal	underwatercow	if you don't hack there is a good chance you won't be able to use Linux, that is point 1.
2007-10-16T11:39:00.000Z	yigal	underwatercow	yes
2007-10-16T11:40:00.000Z	yigal	underwatercow	what instructions did you follow?
2007-10-16T11:40:00.000Z	underwatercow	yigal	none... I just installed kde-desktop, lol
2007-10-16T11:41:00.000Z	yigal	underwatercow	to get cf to work you will need to follow some instructions
2007-10-16T11:41:00.000Z	underwatercow	yigal	I was hoping it would work on it's own... ;-D
2007-10-16T11:41:00.000Z	yigal	underwatercow	you have a lot of faith, I like that :)
2007-10-16T11:42:00.000Z	underwatercow	yigal	seemed like a good enough approach at the time... I had no reason to believe it wouldn't work...
2007-10-16T11:42:00.000Z	underwatercow	yigal	After I installed KDE... I re-decided that I didn't really have any use for KDE, and would rather stick with Gnome anyway... I was just curious why it didn't work
2007-10-16T11:43:00.000Z	yigal	underwatercow	I really like GNOME, I hated for a long time and only used the CLI but GNOME has come just such a long way
2007-10-16T11:44:00.000Z	yigal	underwatercow	did you replace kwin, with "compiz --replace" etc.?
2007-10-16T11:44:00.000Z	underwatercow	yigal	that would be a no
2007-10-16T11:44:00.000Z	yigal	underwatercow	it will take a little more work in KDE but it is not too difficult :)
2007-10-16T11:45:00.000Z	underwatercow	yigal	I like the effects of KDE... but I don't really like the complexity... and I don't like how everything has a K in it...
2007-10-16T11:54:00.000Z	yigal	underwatercow	I was using Debian 3 years ago
2007-10-16T11:59:00.000Z	yigal	underwatercow	ty, best have good shut eye
2007-10-16T12:00:00.000Z	underwatercow	yigal	thanks for your insight on whatever it was we talked about
