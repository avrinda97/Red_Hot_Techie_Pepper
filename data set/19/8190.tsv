2009-06-06T15:31:00.000Z	chazco		Hi... can anyone suggest a good guide to using wpa_supplicant (network manager is broken for my card since 7.10 and wicd has other issues)?
2009-06-06T15:32:00.000Z	chazco		I'm using iwl3945 and have WPA issues under Ubuntu...
2009-06-06T15:32:00.000Z	chazco		I think its this bug: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/272185 ... but it seems to have ceased updating

2009-06-06T15:35:00.000Z	chocobanana	chazco	that's strange. That card should work great on Ubuntu. Which version do you have installed?
2009-06-06T15:35:00.000Z	chazco	chocobanana	- Works fine on WEP, WPA/2, but not the enterprise version... lots of disconnects. Theres a huge (>200 posts) bug report about it, but its stopped updating. Its an Intel 3945ABG.
2009-06-06T15:36:00.000Z	chocobanana	chazco	oh, I see... Well, if there's that huge bug report, then it means that it's probably messed up... Did you already comment on it?
2009-06-06T15:37:00.000Z	chazco	chocobanana	- Seems to be a networkmanger + iwl3945 issue... works fine in wicd (except wicd has its own different problems) and other users on the same network but different cards have no issues with network manager... the bug report is quite old and has no recent updates :(
2009-06-06T15:38:00.000Z	chocobanana	chazco	Ubuntu version?
2009-06-06T15:38:00.000Z	chazco	chocobanana	- Last version that worked was 7.10. Since then its been broken in all versions.
2009-06-06T15:40:00.000Z	chocobanana	chazco	is you SSID hidden?
2009-06-06T15:40:00.000Z	chazco	chocobanana	- Nope
2009-06-06T15:40:00.000Z	chocobanana	chazco	are you on a home network?
2009-06-06T15:41:00.000Z	chazco	chocobanana	- Works fine on my home WPA2 Personal network (network manager or wicd)... any WPA enterprise network however doesnt
2009-06-06T15:43:00.000Z	chocobanana	chazco	I see... The only thing I can suggest is to either use WiCD or use the development version of Ubuntu's Network manager that you can find in this PPA: https://launchpad.net/~network-manager/+archive/ppa
2009-06-06T15:43:00.000Z	chazco	chocobanana	- Using wicd now but seems to have memory/CPU issues... tried the latest network manager build a while ago with no luck, will try again when i can. Thanks :)
2009-06-06T15:44:00.000Z	chocobanana	chazco	OK, good luck and sorry for not being much of help
2009-06-06T15:44:00.000Z	chazco	chocobanana	- Thanks anyway :) Its the bugs that make Ubuntu interesting :D
2009-06-06T15:44:00.000Z	chocobanana	chazco	hehehe... and sometimes annoying!
