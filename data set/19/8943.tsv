2011-08-11T19:58:00.000Z	rabbi1	Pici	thanks, but i have done all those steps, still its not working, just thought of unistalling it and reinstalling it. I am unable to find the libraries./ dependencies they specified there... :(
2011-08-11T19:59:00.000Z	Pici	rabbi1	Those prequesiites should already be installed.
2011-08-11T19:59:00.000Z	rabbi1	Pici	yeah, but i should atleast find that in synaptic manager rite?
2011-08-11T20:01:00.000Z	Pici	rabbi1	yes, but keep in mind that package names are not always standard.
2011-08-11T20:02:00.000Z	rabbi1	Pici	ok, then now how will i know all dependencies are installed, especially when it's not working :-/
2011-08-11T20:04:00.000Z	rabbi1	Pici	can you make something out of this "Komodo-Edit-6/bin/../lib/mozilla/komodo-bin: error while loading shared libraries: libgtk-x11-2.0.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
2011-08-16T21:24:00.000Z	Pici	rabbi1	dia? Or do you mean to actually create the database itself?
2011-08-16T21:24:00.000Z	rabbi1	Pici	nop, i just need a schema designer....
2011-08-16T21:25:00.000Z	Pici	rabbi1	dia might be able to do that.
2011-08-16T21:25:00.000Z	rabbi1	Pici	dia?
2011-09-14T22:20:00.000Z	Pici	rabbi1	How about you just state what your question is.
2011-09-14T22:21:00.000Z	rabbi1	Pici	nothing, can't explain as a simple sentence :)
2012-01-24T21:24:00.000Z	Pici	rabbi1	You will when 12.04 is released.
2012-01-24T21:25:00.000Z	rabbi1	Pici	great. so my applications remain untouched ?
