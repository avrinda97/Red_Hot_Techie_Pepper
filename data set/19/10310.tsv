2009-10-16T07:33:00.000Z	Laibsch		no
2009-10-16T07:33:00.000Z	Laibsch		they are completely independent
2009-10-16T07:33:00.000Z	Laibsch		10.000 km apart computers
2009-10-16T07:34:00.000Z	Laibsch		I assume so
2009-10-16T07:34:00.000Z	Laibsch		But I would like to understand a bit more before I contact the nameserver admin
2009-10-16T07:35:00.000Z	Laibsch		OK
2009-10-16T07:35:00.000Z	Laibsch		that is good
2009-10-16T07:36:00.000Z	Laibsch		This is quite strange
2009-10-16T07:36:00.000Z	Laibsch		It works again now, but I've had it failing two times in the past 24 hours
2009-10-16T07:37:00.000Z	Laibsch		It would still be nice to know a bit more about it
2009-10-16T07:37:00.000Z	infamy	Laibsch	Is the computer that is running the dns always accessible? Do you ever lose contact with it?
2009-10-16T07:38:00.000Z	Laibsch	infamy	I think the DNS server that is problematic (here in Japan) otherwise works OK
2009-10-16T07:39:00.000Z	Laibsch	infamy	the host mail.leggewie.org itself is up 24/7 with a dynip
2009-10-16T07:39:00.000Z	infamy	Laibsch	Just thinking top down. Make sure that you aren't plain having the dns server dropped off the network before digging into the dns stuff
2009-10-16T07:40:00.000Z	Laibsch	infamy	IOW, ping the DNS server before anything else?
2009-10-16T07:41:00.000Z	infamy	Laibsch	Try keeping an ssh session alive on it
2009-10-16T07:41:00.000Z	infamy	Laibsch	Then see if you are getting dropped
2009-10-16T07:41:00.000Z	Laibsch	infamy	I don't understand
2009-10-16T07:42:00.000Z	Laibsch	infamy	I will get dropped at a fixed time of the day
