2007-04-21T10:17:00.000Z	levander		I just read the Ars Technica story about Feisty being released, and Compbiz being in there by default.  I thought they left Compbiz outta Feisty because of stability issues?
2007-04-21T10:17:00.000Z	Jordan_U	levander	It isn't enabled by default
2007-04-21T10:18:00.000Z	levander	Jordan_U	"Ubuntu 7.04 also includes built-in support for compositing and 3D desktop effects via Compiz in the default installation." from http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070420-ubuntu-7-04-feisty-officially-released.html
2007-04-21T10:19:00.000Z	Jordan_U	levander	Yes, "built in support" != turned on by default
2007-06-26T11:31:00.000Z	Jordan_U	levander	Look at any tutorial for compiz, you might also want to download the compiz settings manager, it will also tell you all of the key bindings
2007-06-30T08:51:00.000Z	Jordan_U	levander	You can also just go to a page with flash content and have Firefox install it
2007-06-30T09:09:00.000Z	levander	Jordan_U	have you got a site that will let me click and auto-install Flash 9?  The site I just went to doesn't do that.
2007-06-30T09:12:00.000Z	Jordan_U	levander	http://albinoblacksheep.com/ ?
2007-07-07T15:06:00.000Z	Jordan_U	levander	packages don't get updated after release except for bug fixes, and Gutsy is not fully merged with all upstream packages
2007-07-07T15:07:00.000Z	levander	Jordan_U	That's what I'm saying though.  svk 2.0 came out four months before Feisty was released.
2007-07-07T15:07:00.000Z	Jordan_U	levander	Before the freeze?
2007-07-07T15:08:00.000Z	levander	Jordan_U	svk 2.0 came out in December.  Fesity came out in April.  Unless they froze Feisty five months before it was released... yes, before the freeze.
2007-07-07T15:10:00.000Z	Jordan_U	levander	svk is community maintained so you should ask the maintainer
2007-07-19T14:49:00.000Z	Jordan_U	levander	What do you mean?
2007-07-19T14:50:00.000Z	levander	Jordan_U	Look at the werid char in ubotu's output just before "sudo mount".
2007-07-19T14:58:00.000Z	levander	Jordan_U	what they don't know won't hurt them
2007-07-19T14:59:00.000Z	levander	Jordan_U	It would be different if he weren't asking the type of questions they talk about all the time.
2007-07-19T14:59:00.000Z	Jordan_U	levander	But if they ask for output...
2007-07-19T14:59:00.000Z	levander	Jordan_U	If they find out, they find out, it's not a big deal getting caught.  They may bitch, they may not.
