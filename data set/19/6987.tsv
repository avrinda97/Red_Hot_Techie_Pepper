2008-01-16T02:58:00.000Z	wobblywu		I just disabled my restricted video drivers, and now my Ubuntu (XGL) is very slow. Dragging a window makes it use 90% CPU, for example.
2008-01-16T02:58:00.000Z	wobblywu		is this common? and more importantly, how am i going to fix this? :)
2008-01-16T02:59:00.000Z	unop	wobblywu	if you aren't using the right drivers for your display adapter, you are bound to experience a bad performance
2008-01-16T03:00:00.000Z	wobblywu	unop	so what would the right drivers be then?
2008-01-16T03:01:00.000Z	unop	wobblywu	i dunno depends, prolly one of the restricted drivers you disabled .. what kinda display adapter is it?
2008-01-16T03:02:00.000Z	wobblywu	unop	I disabled my ATI accelerated graphics driver (restricted)
2008-01-16T03:02:00.000Z	wobblywu	unop	and I want to run the unofficial drivers, which i'm assuming i'm running right now (but is horribly slow for me)
2008-01-16T03:03:00.000Z	unop	wobblywu	ATI drivers are restricted .. so i'm assuming whatever you are using right now isnt the right driver
2008-01-16T03:03:00.000Z	unop	wobblywu	can i ask why you dont want to run the ATI drivers?
2008-01-16T03:04:00.000Z	wobblywu	unop	because they're apparently leading to some nasty bugs on my system, aside from the whole them being restricted thing
2008-01-16T03:05:00.000Z	wobblywu	unop	there's aiglx (open source) instead of fglrx (proprietary drivers)
2008-01-16T03:06:00.000Z	unop	wobblywu	the driver being restricted does not imply they have a negative impact on performance .. infact, they are quite well tested and probably work the best for the range of cards they support .. after all they are the vendors' binary blobs.
2008-01-16T03:07:00.000Z	wobblywu	unop	as I said, aside from the whole philosophical standpoint (of not agreeing with them being restricted/proprietary), the drivers are causing problems on my system (which have been reported and verified on launchpad)
2008-01-16T03:07:00.000Z	wobblywu	unop	considering there's an alternative to the restricted ati drivers, i was hoping to run that alternative as i did in the past and it worked fine for me
2008-01-16T03:08:00.000Z	wobblywu	unop	however, that alternative seems to be running rather bad for me at the moment, hence my asking for help
2008-01-16T03:08:00.000Z	unop	wobblywu	well in that case, you've just traded-off one set of problems for another -- guess you'll have to weigh one against another and choose whats best for you, eh? :)
2008-01-16T03:08:00.000Z	wobblywu	unop	you seem to be missing the point entirely for some reason
2008-01-16T03:08:00.000Z	unop	wobblywu	perhaps
2008-01-16T03:09:00.000Z	wobblywu	unop	the drivers i'm using right now used to work on this exact computer. i exchanged them for the official drivers in the past, but because of the problems i'm having with the restricted drivers i want to run the open source drivers again. however, they're not working well at all right now
