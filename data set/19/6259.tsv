2008-07-11T02:53:00.000Z	magnetron	perhamlinux	just ask the channel your question
2008-07-11T02:54:00.000Z	perhamlinux	magnetron	I asked no body answered
2008-07-11T02:55:00.000Z	magnetron	perhamlinux	questions that starting with "anybody" seldom gets answered
2008-07-11T02:58:00.000Z	perhamlinux	magnetron	I reposted it
2008-07-11T03:00:00.000Z	magnetron	perhamlinux	IDE drives isn't called /dev/hd* anymore, any drive can be a /dev/sd* now
2008-09-28T20:35:00.000Z	perhamlinux	magnetron	what do you mean by not seeing the desktop? you're seeing a black page?
2008-09-28T20:36:00.000Z	magnetron	perhamlinux	i see a brown non-clickable square, the same color as in the gdm chooser
2008-09-28T20:37:00.000Z	perhamlinux	magnetron	you just ran nautilus and everything went crazy afterwards?
2008-09-28T20:37:00.000Z	magnetron	perhamlinux	i logged out, and happened to "save my session" in XFCE
2008-09-28T20:38:00.000Z	perhamlinux	magnetron	when you've got the bad screen, press CTRL-ALT-Backspace see if anything happens
2008-09-28T20:39:00.000Z	magnetron	perhamlinux	no, that will just reboot my X
2008-09-28T20:39:00.000Z	perhamlinux	magnetron	I think the problem is the saved session, can you choose any other window manager in gdm?
2008-09-28T20:40:00.000Z	magnetron	perhamlinux	i agree, but i don't want to choose another window manager, i checked in the list and all the usual ones were there. i want to run xfce.
2008-09-28T20:41:00.000Z	perhamlinux	magnetron	I want you to boot with something else just once, and then change back to xfce
2008-09-28T20:42:00.000Z	magnetron	perhamlinux	i found a file in ~/.cache/sessions/ , i will try to delete it and see if it helps.otherwise i'll try your suggestion. see you in some minutes.
2008-09-28T20:42:00.000Z	perhamlinux	magnetron	good luck
2008-09-28T20:44:00.000Z	magnetron	perhamlinux	deleting the session file seems to have fix it. thx.
2008-09-28T20:45:00.000Z	perhamlinux	magnetron	;)
