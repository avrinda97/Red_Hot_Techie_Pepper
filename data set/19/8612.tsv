2007-03-05T15:33:00.000Z	Kronuz		hello
2007-03-05T15:35:00.000Z	Kronuz		hey, I think I'll give Ubuntu a try, but I'd like to know how can I make my RAID disk array work in it
2007-03-05T15:35:00.000Z	Kronuz		I'm using nForce4 RAID
2007-03-05T15:36:00.000Z	shatrat	Kronuz	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FakeRaidHowto  without typo
2007-03-05T15:37:00.000Z	shatrat	Kronuz	its partly a software raid.  Check the prices of full-on hardware raid 5 controllers and youll see why
2007-03-05T15:37:00.000Z	Kronuz	shatrat	so the nForce4 RAID is software handled?
2007-03-05T15:37:00.000Z	shatrat	Kronuz	partly.  The how-to explains it better than I can
2007-03-05T15:39:00.000Z	shatrat	Kronuz	what video card do you have?
2007-03-05T15:39:00.000Z	shatrat	Kronuz	you should have no problems with beryl in that case, but one thing at a time.
2007-03-05T15:42:00.000Z	shatrat	Kronuz	I dunno, ubuntu has always been pretty popular
2007-03-05T15:58:00.000Z	shatrat	Kronuz	the kernel is more designed for desktops/laptops, but its still better than windows for a server
2007-03-05T15:59:00.000Z	shatrat	Kronuz	what kind of editor is that?
2007-03-05T16:02:00.000Z	shatrat	Kronuz	there are tons of integrated development environments available through apt, no reason you cant try them all
2007-03-05T16:05:00.000Z	shatrat	Kronuz	64 bit is more trouble than it is worth, imo
2007-03-05T16:09:00.000Z	shatrat	Kronuz	check http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/common-tasks-chap.html
2007-03-06T06:53:00.000Z	shatrat	Kronuz	it's very easy to try out lots of apps by browsing through synaptic, worry about that after you have installed
2007-03-06T06:58:00.000Z	shatrat	Kronuz	xchat has more options, gaim is an all in one thing that also does msn, aim, et cetera.  I prefer xchat for irc
2007-03-06T06:58:00.000Z	shatrat	Kronuz	yeah gaim is on the liveCD
2007-03-07T17:36:00.000Z	Kronuz	shatrat	I found this page where it says I should install the Ubuntu restricted extras, in Add/Remove... -> Other, but it's not there
