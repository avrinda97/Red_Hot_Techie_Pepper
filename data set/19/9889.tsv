2006-10-30T11:13:00.000Z	hockyhair		i am having problems with sudo apt-get install linux-dri-modules-`uname -r`
2006-10-30T11:13:00.000Z	hockyhair		it is not finding anything for me, and it is necc for aiglx i guess
2006-10-30T11:14:00.000Z	hockyhair		i have repos uptodate as far as i know, and added the repos from the aiglx page i am looking at
2006-10-30T11:14:00.000Z	wastrel	hockyhair	 linux-restricted-modules-$(uname -r)
2006-10-30T11:15:00.000Z	hockyhair	wastrel	?
2006-10-30T11:15:00.000Z	hockyhair	wastrel	what are you saying? to apt-get that first?
2006-10-30T11:16:00.000Z	wastrel	hockyhair	 the package name is linux-restricted-modules-$(uname -r)  not linux-dri-modules
2006-10-30T11:16:00.000Z	hockyhair	wastrel	all the stuff i have found says linux-dri-modules..
2006-10-30T11:16:00.000Z	hockyhair		there is nothing about restricted modules, and that is already uptodate
2006-10-30T11:17:00.000Z	wastrel	hockyhair	 what version of ubuntu are you running?
2006-10-30T11:17:00.000Z	hockyhair	wastrel	dapper
2006-10-30T11:17:00.000Z	hockyhair		maybe my video card is not supported by aiglx
2006-10-30T11:17:00.000Z	hockyhair		i have a 200m ati radeon
2006-10-30T11:17:00.000Z	hockyhair		with fglrx
2006-10-30T11:18:00.000Z	hockyhair		xgl works on it
2006-10-30T11:18:00.000Z	hockyhair		i hear that aiglx is the way to go though..
2006-10-30T11:18:00.000Z	hockyhair		so possibly it is not avail for 200m yet?
2006-10-30T11:18:00.000Z	wastrel	hockyhair	 apt-cache search linux-restricted-modules    then apt-cache search linux-dri-modules    linux-dri-modules is the wrong package name :]
