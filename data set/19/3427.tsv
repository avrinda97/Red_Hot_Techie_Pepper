2009-08-19T08:54:00.000Z	nownot		i have this board http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813188035 with a NVIDIA nForce 730i northbridge that supports raid 5, is there a way to do hardware raid 5 with this and if so is there somewhere i can read on how to do this
2009-08-19T08:56:00.000Z	majuk	nownot	No, it's software RAID5, not true hardware driven. You're better off using mdadm and disabling the BIOS RAID settings.
2009-08-19T08:57:00.000Z	nownot	majuk	you mean my board only supports raid 5 software? or ubuntu does
2009-08-19T08:57:00.000Z	majuk	nownot	Your board. I have the same northbridge. They say it's 'RAID capable' because it can transmit to all the SATA ports simultaneously.
2009-08-19T08:58:00.000Z	majuk	nownot	But there's no hardware RAID driver. It has to be software driven.
2009-08-19T08:58:00.000Z	nownot	majuk	sigh, well that sucks
2009-08-19T08:58:00.000Z	majuk	nownot	Actually, I've been running a RAID5 array for 3 years and haven't lost a single file.
2009-08-19T08:58:00.000Z	majuk	nownot	*software RAID5
2009-08-19T08:58:00.000Z	nownot	majuk	software?
2009-08-19T08:58:00.000Z	majuk		Yup
2009-08-19T08:59:00.000Z	nownot	majuk	speed issues?
2009-08-19T08:59:00.000Z	majuk	nownot	Not at all.
2009-08-19T09:00:00.000Z	nownot	majuk	yeah i looked at mdadm and it looks easy to get going
2009-08-19T09:00:00.000Z	majuk	nownot	And I've worked with it. Swapped 2 drives, expanded from 3 to 5 disks, and never even had a hiccup.
2009-08-19T09:00:00.000Z	majuk	nownot	Yea, it's pretty simple. Personally, I liked the way LVM worked on top of RAID. Let me find the howto I used to set it up for you.
2009-08-19T09:02:00.000Z	majuk	nownot	Bunnies, I can't find it.
2009-08-19T09:09:00.000Z	nownot	majuk	its alright
2009-08-19T09:09:00.000Z	nownot		guess im stuck w/ software raid
2009-08-19T09:10:00.000Z	nownot	majuk	well how do i know if a board has software as opposed to hardware
