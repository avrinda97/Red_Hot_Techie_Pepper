2006-12-29T17:51:00.000Z	eXistenZ		How can I fix this "Unable to start the settings manager 'gnome-settings-daemon'."
2006-12-29T17:52:00.000Z	stefg	eXistenZ	huh? This is a bug from pre-Release edgy, which is solved for a looong time...
2006-12-29T17:53:00.000Z	eXistenZ	stefg	My system is updated
2006-12-29T17:53:00.000Z	stefg	eXistenZ	search through launchpab-bugs, you'll find something there
2006-12-29T17:57:00.000Z	eXistenZ	stefg	I cannot find this bug there
2006-12-29T06:00:00.000Z	stefg	eXistenZ	maybe  this helps :  http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=324227
2006-12-29T06:00:00.000Z	eXistenZ	stefg	I don't have kde though
2006-12-29T06:01:00.000Z	stefg	eXistenZ	sorry, i can't really tell what's wrong. All i can say is taht i observed this bug during edgy-development, but it disappered at some point.
2006-12-29T06:04:00.000Z	eXistenZ	stefg	Can metacity cause this problem?
2006-12-29T06:05:00.000Z	stefg	eXistenZ	i don't think so... can you manually start gnome-settings-daemon ?
2006-12-29T06:05:00.000Z	eXistenZ	stefg	yes
2006-12-29T06:06:00.000Z	eXistenZ	stefg	it is running
2006-12-29T06:06:00.000Z	stefg	eXistenZ	... maybe you just have a broken user setting in your account. try to add a new user for testing and see if the prob persists
2006-12-29T06:07:00.000Z	eXistenZ	stefg	how can I start gnome' config manager
2006-12-29T06:07:00.000Z	eXistenZ	stefg	I press gconf but it won't start up
2006-12-29T06:11:00.000Z	eXistenZ	stefg	When I select keyboard preferences, that message appears
2006-12-29T06:11:00.000Z	stefg	eXistenZ	which is pretty plausible
2006-12-29T06:11:00.000Z	eXistenZ	stefg	why?
