2005-08-25T05:27:00.000Z	helloyo		i'm trying to install breezy badger off the cd, but i think there is a driver problem which locks it up, says that it can't use 8139cp and that i should use 8139too instead, but how?
2005-08-25T05:29:00.000Z	helloyo		could somebody give me a hand installing breezy off the latest cd?
2005-08-25T05:30:00.000Z	kemik	helloyo	 change hoary to breezy, "apt-get dist-upgrade"
2005-08-25T05:30:00.000Z	kemik	helloyo	 not that it is recommended, especially not if you need help already
2005-08-25T05:30:00.000Z	helloyo	kemik	ok, if you think thats the best way
2005-08-25T05:31:00.000Z	helloyo	kemik	what do you mean? its not recommended to dist-upgrade? i think the installer is just using a wrong driver, but i dont know how to change it
2005-08-25T05:31:00.000Z	kemik	helloyo	 Breezy is not stable, so it can break your entire system
2005-08-25T05:32:00.000Z	helloyo	kemik	yeah, i realise that, i can fix quite a few things, but no idea how to change the driver
2005-08-25T05:32:00.000Z	kemik	helloyo	 what driver?
2005-08-25T05:33:00.000Z	helloyo	kemik	it comes up with an error that says 8139cp not supported, try 8139too
2005-08-25T05:34:00.000Z	kemik	helloyo	 perhaps get the driversoftware from manufacturer, compile and then "modprobe"
2005-08-25T05:34:00.000Z	kemik	helloyo	 in worst case scenario you'll have to recompile the kernel aswell :/
2005-08-25T05:34:00.000Z	helloyo	kemik	i think i'll wait then... haven't had problems before, so i guess it will be fixed
2005-08-25T05:35:00.000Z	kemik	helloyo	 but your NIC is not working now ?
2005-08-25T05:36:00.000Z	kemik	helloyo	 i think you can try to get the 8139too source/binary and modprobe it
2005-08-25T05:36:00.000Z	helloyo	kemik	i am using hoary at the moment, and its working fie
2005-08-25T05:36:00.000Z	kemik	helloyo	  oh.. i c.. so why isit complaining? =)
2005-08-25T05:36:00.000Z	helloyo	kemik	the installer stops at something like "Downloading file 7 of 8"
2005-08-25T05:36:00.000Z	helloyo	kemik	haha, exactly
