2010-02-04T06:57:00.000Z	becker_11		Can someone explain to me how I am running ubuntu 9.10 and gpodder is v0.16.1 when the gpodder website tells me the latest version is 2.1???
2010-02-04T06:58:00.000Z	rww	becker_11	The new version of Ubuntu coming out in April has 2.1.
2010-02-04T06:59:00.000Z	becker_11	rww	cool thanks
2010-02-04T06:59:00.000Z	rww	becker_11	0.16 was added to Karmic (released in October). Jaunty (last April) had 0.14.
2010-02-04T06:59:00.000Z	rww	becker_11	from the look of the website, they went straight from 0.16 to 2.0 for some reason, so it's actually not old :)
2010-02-04T07:00:00.000Z	becker_11	rww	okay cool
2010-03-01T11:28:00.000Z	rww	becker_11	yes
2010-03-01T11:28:00.000Z	becker_11	rww	that explains my frustration with uploading my key to github
2010-03-01T11:29:00.000Z	rww	becker_11	which one do you want to make? I can link you to guides for either...
2010-03-01T11:29:00.000Z	becker_11	rww	I need a ssh signing key for github the other key/s I've already got

2010-03-01T11:30:00.000Z	becker_11	rww	thanks
2010-03-01T11:31:00.000Z	rww	becker_11	no problem. Let me know if that link isn't clear :)
2010-03-01T11:31:00.000Z	becker_11	rww	will do - brb
2010-03-01T11:35:00.000Z	becker_11	rww	created the key thanks the guide was simple
2010-03-01T11:36:00.000Z	rww	becker_11	awesome :)
2010-03-01T12:00:00.000Z	becker_11	rww	I've entered the pub key into the form on github but it's still processing after about 3 minutes surely it should have gone through or rejected by now?
2010-03-01T12:01:00.000Z	rww	becker_11	no idea. I've never used github :(
2010-03-01T12:01:00.000Z	becker_11	rww	okay guess I'll just leave it running then
