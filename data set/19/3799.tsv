2009-05-25T00:25:00.000Z	Nash_		Ive got ubuntu 9.04 with Compiz manager how do I install those themes on gnome-look.org ?
2009-05-25T00:26:00.000Z	Louis_	Nash_	:  there are usually instructions on gnome-look, but for most themes, you just drag and drop the tar.gz archive into the theme manager window (which is somewhere under the System menu)
2009-05-25T00:26:00.000Z	Louis_	Nash_	 you can also get there by right-clicking your dekstop, picking change background, and then selecting the theme tab... you can just drag them in there most of the time as well
2009-05-25T00:27:00.000Z	Nash_	Louis_	i downloaded a compiz theme but it has an extension .emerald
2009-05-25T00:27:00.000Z	Louis_	Nash_	 aah... that's for use with emerald.  sudo apt-get install emerald I think...
2009-05-25T00:28:00.000Z	Nash_	Louis_	Ok
2009-05-25T00:28:00.000Z	Nash_	Louis_	Where do i find emerald after installation ?
2009-05-25T00:29:00.000Z	Louis_	Nash_	 i forget to be honest... try alt + F2 and type in emerald
2009-05-25T00:29:00.000Z	Nash_	Louis_	ok thanks
2009-05-25T00:29:00.000Z	Louis_	Nash_	:  No problem
2009-05-25T00:29:00.000Z	Louis_	Nash_	:  you'll also need to use emerald as your default WM.  Do that by hitting alt + F2 and typing emerald --replace
2009-05-25T00:33:00.000Z	Nash_	Louis_	I imported an theme in emerald but the only options is exit or edit the theme, how do i turn the theme on ?
2009-05-25T00:33:00.000Z	Louis_	Nash_	:  No clue. you'll have to mess with it.  it's been a while since i've used emerald
2009-05-25T00:33:00.000Z	Louis_	Nash_	 I seem to remember you just have to select the theme by clicking on it or something
2009-05-25T00:34:00.000Z	Louis_	Nash_	 I don't know
2009-05-25T00:46:00.000Z	Louis_	Nash_	what version of ubuntu are you running?
2009-05-25T00:47:00.000Z	Louis_	Nash_	I wonder if it's a bug then... I know the 9.04 development was rushed, and emerald doesnt have a particularly large share of users...
2009-05-25T00:48:00.000Z	Nash_	Louis_	What is most commonly used for window decoration then ?
2009-05-25T00:48:00.000Z	Louis_	Nash_	the default -- gtk/metacity
