2009-04-04T11:59:00.000Z	Qrius		Any suggestions why my package installer would hang?
2009-04-04T12:01:00.000Z	debia	Qrius	what were you trying to do when it started hanging ?
2009-04-04T12:05:00.000Z	debia	Qrius	if you are able to launch a terminal (press Alt+F2, type gnome-terminal in the dialog), you can use top command to see cpu usage
2009-04-04T12:07:00.000Z	Qrius	debia	here's what I got: usage: top -hv | -bcisSH -d delay -n iterations [-u user | -U user] -p pid [,pid ...]
2009-04-04T12:08:00.000Z	debia	Qrius	just type the one word "top" (without quote), at the prompt
2009-04-04T12:09:00.000Z	Qrius	debia	 I'm at around 31%
2009-04-04T12:10:00.000Z	debia	Qrius	is your package manager still hanging
2009-04-04T12:10:00.000Z	Qrius	debia	yep
2009-04-04T12:11:00.000Z	Qrius	debia	I see 2 zombie tasks what are those?
2009-04-04T12:11:00.000Z	debia	Qrius	can u give me the names of the tasks
2009-04-04T12:15:00.000Z	Qrius	debia	I've got over 100 sleeping.  1 or 2 running.  Should I be looking for a particular task?
2009-04-04T12:16:00.000Z	debia	Qrius	you said u had 2 zombie tasks. can u give me the name of these tasks ?
2009-04-04T12:16:00.000Z	debia	Qrius	btw what is a "Brother printer"
2009-04-04T12:18:00.000Z	Qrius	debia	 Not sure how I'd identify the two zombie tasks.  Everything in System Monitor is sleeping.  Brother is the brand name of the inkjet printer I'm trying to install.
2009-04-04T12:19:00.000Z	Qrius	debia	The only task that continuously uses CPU is compis.real
2009-04-04T12:20:00.000Z	Qrius	debia	...besides Pidgin and System Monitor, that is.
2009-04-04T12:21:00.000Z	debia	Qrius	package manager is synpatic right ? running ubuntu or kubuntu ?
2009-04-04T12:22:00.000Z	debia	Qrius	in any case I dont see any option but to force quit it
2009-04-04T12:24:00.000Z	Qrius	debia	I'm not sure if this is the synaptic package manager.  The recent security update took a bit of time, but it installed OK.  I force quit this several times but when I re-try, it asks if I want to re-install.  The latest flash player does the same hang.
