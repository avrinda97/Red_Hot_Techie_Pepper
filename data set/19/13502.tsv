2005-04-08T08:43:00.000Z	KBJ		does anybody know of a good program to convert between mp3, ogg and wav?
2005-04-08T08:43:00.000Z	kotatsu	KBJ	gstreamer
2005-04-08T08:43:00.000Z	kotatsu	KBJ	specifically, gst-launch-0.8
2005-04-08T08:43:00.000Z	KBJ	kotatsu	sounds good, but how? :)
2005-04-08T08:43:00.000Z	kotatsu	KBJ	$ man gst-launch-0.8 =)
2005-04-08T08:43:00.000Z	KBJ	kotatsu	i was trying that, but i couldn't seem to get it to convert from mp3 to wav
2005-04-08T08:43:00.000Z	kotatsu	KBJ	it explains the process (including examples) far better than I could
2005-04-08T08:44:00.000Z	KBJ	kotatsu	i tried this: gst-launch-0.8 filesrc=13982.mp3 ! mad ! waveenc ! filesink location=test.wav
2005-04-08T08:44:00.000Z	KBJ		i think it didn't like the waveenc
2005-04-08T08:44:00.000Z	KBJ		i also tried wavenc... but i don't which one to put there
2005-04-08T08:44:00.000Z	kotatsu	KBJ	it will probably be something like um... $ gst-launch-0.8 filesrc location=file.mp3 ! spider ! vorbisenc ! filesink location=file.ogg
2005-04-08T08:45:00.000Z	KBJ		but i want wav as output
2005-04-08T08:45:00.000Z	kotatsu	KBJ	did that give you any errors?
2005-04-08T08:45:00.000Z	kotatsu	KBJ	looks right to me, let me test it
2005-04-08T08:46:00.000Z	KBJ		ERROR: pipeline could not be constructed: Unrecoverable syntax error
2005-04-08T08:46:00.000Z	kotatsu	KBJ	try using spider instead of mad
2005-04-08T08:47:00.000Z	KBJ	kotatsu	still doesn't work
2005-04-08T08:47:00.000Z	kotatsu	KBJ	yeah, odd it's bailing out for me too for some reason
2005-04-08T08:48:00.000Z	kotatsu	KBJ	oh yeah, oops... it's not filesrc=, it's filesrc location=
