2007-02-20T10:01:00.000Z	tun2		ok, i need some SERIOUS help here...
2007-02-20T10:02:00.000Z	tun2		here's the thing: I have Kubuntu, but I just isntalled Gnome. It was a rough install, and i don't think i did it quite right.somebody was helping me earlier (devilsadvocate), and he's still online, but won't reply to any of my messages
2007-02-20T10:03:00.000Z	tun2		I'm gonna pastebin the terminal history in a sec
2007-02-20T10:03:00.000Z	elyon225	tun2	First of all, if you're sending him private messages, you must be registered with the IRC server or he won't get them.
2007-02-20T10:04:00.000Z	tun2	elyon225	i wasn't sending him PM
2007-02-20T10:04:00.000Z	elyon225	tun2	Second, what command did you use to install gnome?
2007-02-20T10:05:00.000Z	elyon225	tun2	What packages did you install?
2007-02-20T10:05:00.000Z	tun2	elyon225	i tried ubuntu-desktop, and it didn't work. so then i tried gnome
2007-02-20T10:05:00.000Z	elyon225	tun2	Define "didn't work"
2007-02-20T10:06:00.000Z	tun2	elyon225	i'm trying to open the terminal history so i can pastebin it to you...
2007-02-20T10:08:00.000Z	tun2	elyon225	ok, my text editor won't open and niether will the terminal...
2007-02-20T10:08:00.000Z	elyon225	tun2	Try running those from the terminal.... oh, nevermind lol
2007-02-20T10:11:00.000Z	tun2	elyon225	odd... i'm not sure how to show you the problem... it won't even let me log out!
2007-02-20T10:13:00.000Z	elyon225	tun2	Have you tried restarting X?  Press CRTL-ALT-BACKSPACE
2007-02-20T10:14:00.000Z	elyon225	tun2	Wait
2007-02-20T10:14:00.000Z	elyon225	tun2	Don't use poweroff.
2007-02-20T10:14:00.000Z	elyon225	tun2	sudo shutdown -r now
2007-02-20T10:14:00.000Z	elyon225	tun2	That will shut things down cleanly.
2007-02-20T10:15:00.000Z	elyon225	tun2	Yes... shutdown let's you specify a certain time to shutdown... saying "now" does it, well, now ;)
