2007-12-29T17:10:00.000Z	Jan`	imaginator	for some reason, I can't talk to you in private message.
2007-12-29T17:10:00.000Z	Jan`	imaginator	Still can't. Nick not registered.
2007-12-29T17:11:00.000Z	imaginator	Jan`	I guess you need to register your nick then to talk with anyone now
2007-12-29T17:42:00.000Z	imaginator	Jan`	what hardware?
2007-12-29T17:43:00.000Z	imaginator	Jan`	which flavor of the million permutations of a PC do you have?
2007-12-29T17:43:00.000Z	imaginator	Jan`	what's the problem with the Live CD?
2007-12-29T17:45:00.000Z	imaginator	Jan`	how did the boot loader behave?
2007-12-29T17:45:00.000Z	Jan`	imaginator	what's a boot loader?
2007-12-29T17:46:00.000Z	imaginator	Jan`	the BIOS should attempt to load the image on the Live CD
2007-12-29T17:46:00.000Z	imaginator	Jan`	what tool did you use to burn the ISO image?
2007-12-29T17:46:00.000Z	Jan`	imaginator	InfraRecorder.
2007-12-29T17:47:00.000Z	imaginator	Jan`	can you view the CD in Windows from my computer?
2007-12-29T17:47:00.000Z	Jan`	imaginator	s'what I'm doing. Seems empty.
2007-12-29T17:48:00.000Z	imaginator	Jan`	I think scguy318 is suggesting that you try to see what the image contains
2007-12-29T17:48:00.000Z	imaginator	Jan`	does InfraRecord have that ability?
2007-12-29T17:51:00.000Z	imaginator	Jan`	I think your suspicion is correct
2007-12-29T18:10:00.000Z	imaginator	Jan`	what are you planning to do?
2007-12-29T18:11:00.000Z	imaginator	Jan`	I have my Ubuntu setup with a TV-out and it works fine.  I use nvtv to enable it to work over an S-video adapter to a normal (non-HD) TV
2007-12-29T18:12:00.000Z	imaginator	Jan`	yes, just a different dialect :)
