2011-02-28T21:34:00.000Z	barf		Is there anything in proc that can tell which motherboard is on the system?
2011-02-28T21:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	barf	sudo dmidecode | more
2011-04-20T18:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	barf	it is by default
2011-04-20T18:03:00.000Z	barf	ActionParsnip	I am not able to make it work, where is it configured?
2011-04-20T18:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	barf	connect to it with something like filezilla
2011-04-20T18:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	barf	with zero config after install openssh-server will give you X forwarding, sftp and sshfs
2011-04-20T18:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	barf	try with filezilla to test
2011-04-20T18:05:00.000Z	barf	ActionParsnip	can ncftp do it?
2011-04-20T18:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	barf	not used it
2011-04-20T18:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	barf	a quick websearch would have given you this: http://filezilla-project.org/download.php?type=client
2011-04-20T18:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	barf	you should try that a little instead of simply asking
2011-04-20T18:18:00.000Z	barf	ActionParsnip	I tried Filezilla 10.0.0.9 user pass 22
2011-04-20T18:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	barf	sftp should do it. I use andftp and it connects to my ssh port with no issue.
2011-04-20T18:21:00.000Z	barf	ActionParsnip	I see that Filezilla connects to sshd, but how can I check the logs, which protocol is used?
2011-04-20T18:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	barf	sftp is the protocol
2011-04-20T18:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	barf	yes, ssh is a swiss armyknife of tools
2011-04-20T18:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	barf	you could a while back
2011-04-20T18:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	barf	if you ask in #ubuntu+1 they will help with that
2011-04-20T18:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	barf	but it isn't ready or stable
