2008-02-11T22:57:00.000Z	shazow		hiya, I keep getting "FATAL: Error running install command for nvidia" after installing nvidia-glx-new (also tried using Nvidia's own self-installing script"), any idea what I could try?
2008-02-11T22:58:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	shazow	What nvidia card are youusing
2008-02-11T22:58:00.000Z	shazow	Jack_Sparrow	7600 GS
2008-02-11T23:02:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	shazow	Did you post your xorg to the pastebin yet by chance
2008-02-11T23:03:00.000Z	shazow	Jack_Sparrow	no, but I dont think xorg has anything to do with it, the module wont even load with modprobe nvidia (gives the error i mentioned before)
2008-02-11T23:04:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	shazow	I always like to look in there... What all have you done or tried so far?
2008-02-11T23:05:00.000Z	shazow	Jack_Sparrow	I tried uninstalling nvidia-glx-new, rebooting, installing the nvidia official driver, rebooting, uninstalling, rebooting, installing nvidia-glx-new again... i tried installing a new linux-image and then reinstalling... no help on any of those
2008-02-11T23:05:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	shazow	If enabling the restricted drivers doesnt work and installing them manually doesnt work then there is a much deeper issue on that box
2008-02-11T23:06:00.000Z	shazow	Jack_Sparrow	any hypothesis as to what that might be, or should I just do a clean install?
2008-02-11T23:07:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	shazow	HAve you installed things from outside official repos, or used scripts like envy or automatix (both scripts are a bad idea)
2008-02-11T23:07:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	shazow	You didnt add debian repos or anything right
2008-02-11T23:08:00.000Z	shazow	Jack_Sparrow	actually i used the "remastered kde4 gutsy" livecd for kicks.. maybe that is part of the issue?
2008-02-11T23:08:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	shazow	Yep, that would do iut
2008-02-11T23:08:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow		it
2008-02-11T23:08:00.000Z	shazow	Jack_Sparrow	fresh install it is then, thanks
2008-02-11T23:09:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	shazow	Wish it was a better answer
2008-02-11T23:09:00.000Z	shazow	Jack_Sparrow	that's the price you pay for having a convenient distro like ubuntu that tries to do everything for you :P
2008-02-11T23:10:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	shazow	At least you dont need to call MS to activate it .. :)
2008-02-11T23:10:00.000Z	shazow	Jack_Sparrow	amen ;)
