2006-03-23T10:30:00.000Z	phiber-optic		anyone has any idea why noone can log into my webserver?
2006-03-23T10:30:00.000Z	dabaR	phiber-optic	can you open a browser and get a page on http://localhost on the same comptuer?
2006-03-23T10:30:00.000Z	phiber-optic	dabaR	I get Apache2.04. maine website
2006-03-23T10:31:00.000Z	dabaR	phiber-optic	good, do you have port 80 on your router forwarded to the IP address of your computer?
2006-03-23T10:32:00.000Z	phiber-optic	dabaR	I have di524, private Ip is the one that I have for muy own computer... bptotocol tcp, private port i put 80 and public port 80
2006-03-23T10:33:00.000Z	dabaR	phiber-optic	and what is the public IP of the router?
2006-03-23T10:34:00.000Z	phiber-optic	dabaR	wouldnt that be mine own ip?
2006-03-23T10:35:00.000Z	dabaR	phiber-optic	it would be what you get when you go to dnsstuff.org in a browser. it is in the top right
2006-03-23T10:38:00.000Z	dabaR	phiber-optic	dnsstuff.com
2006-03-23T10:39:00.000Z	dabaR	phiber-optic	not that I would expect. I expect improper port forwarding.
2006-03-23T10:42:00.000Z	dabaR	phiber-optic	you could forward UDP and TCP too, maybe it will make a diff.
2006-03-23T10:43:00.000Z	dabaR	phiber-optic	I see your ssh is working. I am not sure why it would not work. Are you sure your ISP does not block it? Try a different port in the httpd.conf file under /etc/apache2.
2006-03-23T10:44:00.000Z	dabaR	phiber-optic	8080 sounds reasonable
2006-03-23T10:45:00.000Z	dabaR	phiber-optic	nothing at all?
2006-03-23T10:46:00.000Z	dabaR	phiber-optic	post to paste.ubuntu-nl.org.
2006-03-23T10:47:00.000Z	phiber-optic	dabaR	i already posted
2006-03-23T10:49:00.000Z	dabaR	phiber-optic	not here.
2006-03-23T10:51:00.000Z	phiber-optic	dabaR	where u able to find it?
2006-03-23T10:56:00.000Z	dabaR	phiber-optic	those are too short for real configs. I am not sure about apache2. Try apache, and change the port number in its httpd.conf file. Also join #apache for apache2 config help
