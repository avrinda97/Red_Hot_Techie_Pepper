2010-07-24T02:42:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	samoy2002	when you actually save index.html, is it source code or 0 byte file ?
2010-07-24T02:43:00.000Z	samoy2002	ilovefairuz	 i simply pico index.html, insert some random text
2010-07-24T02:43:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	samoy2002	access it in a browser and save the file, see if there's anything in it
2010-07-24T02:45:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	samoy2002	random text? not the original html tags?
2010-07-24T02:45:00.000Z	samoy2002	ilovefairuz	i hadnt put any tags into it at this point, let me do that, see if they come through
2010-07-24T02:46:00.000Z	samoy2002	ilovefairuz	 Thank you, when i insert tags it seems to process it differently, it is displaying correct now
2010-07-24T02:47:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	samoy2002	well i'm not sure i understand you but glad i've helped!

2010-07-24T02:49:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	samoy2002	do you understand how html markup works ?
2010-07-24T02:49:00.000Z	samoy2002	ilovefairuz	i used to do a lot of pages, mostly php programming, been a long time though, i imagine i have forgotten a fair amount over time
2010-07-24T02:50:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	samoy2002	try http://w3schools.org for some introductory tutorials
2010-07-24T02:50:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	samoy2002	w3schools.com not .org
2010-07-24T02:52:00.000Z	samoy2002	ilovefairuz	thank you, i wont be getting into the programming aspects again, have to hire people for that, my businesses take up to much time, but i do however need to get the servers setup to host many pages
2010-07-24T02:53:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	samoy2002	there are some all-in-on books that explains Web technologies (the network, html, css, etc) and they are rather fun to read
