2008-07-25T18:49:00.000Z	fiiisk		is the authentication  plain or secured?
2008-07-25T18:49:00.000Z	fiiisk		in outlook its Basic
2008-07-25T18:51:00.000Z	DistroJockey	fiiisk	if it's an Exchange 2007 server, I'm pretty sure you won't get it to work. But good luck and I'd love to know how if you do. :)
2008-07-25T18:52:00.000Z	fiiisk	DistroJockey	i have an exchange 2003 server i'm trying to work this on
2008-07-25T18:52:00.000Z	fiiisk		any difference?
2008-07-25T18:53:00.000Z	DistroJockey	fiiisk	not too sure sorry
2008-07-25T18:54:00.000Z	fiiisk		damn why isnt there so many others having this issue.. no posts on the forums either
2008-07-25T18:55:00.000Z	DistroJockey	fiiisk	not an SSL issue?
2008-07-25T18:56:00.000Z	fiiisk	DistroJockey	have it working on hundreds of outlook clients
2008-07-25T18:57:00.000Z	DistroJockey	fiiisk	I think you probably know more about that than me then. Good luck.
2008-07-25T18:58:00.000Z	fiiisk		i keep getting the error that there is no mailbox for the user and we know that isnt so :)
2008-07-25T18:58:00.000Z	fiiisk		thanks DistroJockey
2008-07-25T19:00:00.000Z	DistroJockey	fiiisk	I just know I can't connect to an Exchange 2007 server with Evolution. (That's why I replied and am interested)
