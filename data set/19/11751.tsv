2006-04-15T10:20:00.000Z	munzir		Hi, Seveas is telling me that browsing http://82.211.81.151 prompts him to download Packages.gz. I and many others I just asked sees a folder named apache2-default/        07-Jan-2006 13:42 can some one confirm whether Seveas has the single correct PC in the world? ;)
2006-04-15T10:22:00.000Z	gnomefreak	munzir	if you click the default folder it will prompt you
2006-04-15T10:23:00.000Z	gnomefreak	munzir	no he might have just missed telling you that step
2006-04-15T10:24:00.000Z	munzir	gnomefreak	no even clicking that folder just open a default page here
2006-04-15T10:24:00.000Z	gnomefreak	munzir	the top of it say if you dont see it downloading than do something?
2006-04-15T10:25:00.000Z	munzir	gnomefreak	the top of it show for me: f you can see this, it means that the installation of the Apache web server software on this system was successful. You may now add content to this directory and replace this page.
2006-04-24T08:15:00.000Z	gnomefreak	munzir	there are more than just those in that package but all depends on your needs
2006-04-24T08:16:00.000Z	munzir	gnomefreak	can you give me just one format that i can't play without it so I know?
2006-04-24T08:16:00.000Z	gnomefreak	munzir	no i dont have any use for them but the package is huge
2006-05-05T13:03:00.000Z	gnomefreak	munzir	to remove kubuntu-desktop (almost if not fully) sudo apt-get remove --purge libqt3-mt
2006-05-27T07:15:00.000Z	gnomefreak	munzir	dont know maybe ask in a rpm distros channel?
2006-05-27T07:17:00.000Z	munzir	gnomefreak	sorry! should I ask in fedora channel a question what's the equivalent command of chkconfig in ubutnu?!
2006-05-27T07:18:00.000Z	gnomefreak	munzir	you asked isnt there a direct way to like chkconfig in rpm-based distros
2006-05-27T07:20:00.000Z	munzir	gnomefreak	sorry if my question is  not clear. is it clear now or still need clarification?
2006-05-27T07:20:00.000Z	munzir	gnomefreak	in fedora I use chkconfig in ubuntu I don't know what to use
2006-05-27T07:22:00.000Z	gnomefreak	munzir	i relized what you were asking as i was typing it hence the sorry part of it
2006-07-21T16:18:00.000Z	gnomefreak	munzir	it doesnt unles syou add the opera repo but itws just as easy as going to opera.com downloading it than running sudo dpkg -i opera<tab>
2006-07-21T16:19:00.000Z	munzir	gnomefreak	ok I will download form opera site but that page needs to be fixed I guess. thx
2006-07-21T16:55:00.000Z	munzir	gnomefreak	I just found it won't install on my amd64! what a pity that I need to install a chroot system to have it working
