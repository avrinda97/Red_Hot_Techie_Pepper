2010-08-15T10:06:00.000Z	lonejack		Hi, I'm using Lucid version, does anybody know where are stored repositories? I knew that the list was stored in etc/apt/sources.list. Do you know if exist another?
2010-08-15T10:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lonejack	 in that directory theres that file and the sources.list.d
2010-08-15T10:07:00.000Z	lonejack	Dr_Willis	yesss, now I see
2010-08-15T10:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lonejack	 the habbit of altering sources.list is a little outdated.. normally one makes entries one per file in  sources.list.d now
2010-08-15T10:08:00.000Z	lonejack	Dr_Willis	thank you
2010-08-15T10:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lonejack	 makes it  a MUCh cleaner setup.
2010-10-24T14:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lonejack	 what cfg? you edited /boot/grub.cfg  ?
2010-10-24T14:11:00.000Z	lonejack	Dr_Willis	not that file. Modification on that file are not correct.
2010-10-24T14:11:00.000Z	lonejack	Dr_Willis	give me a minute
2010-10-24T14:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lonejack	 the other grub2 configs are /etc/default/grub and /etc/grub.d/*
2010-10-24T14:12:00.000Z	lonejack	Dr_Willis	ok.
2010-10-24T14:13:00.000Z	lonejack	Dr_Willis	because I modified the file remotely I used vi
2010-10-24T14:13:00.000Z	lonejack	Dr_Willis	so I don't know what I did..
2010-10-24T14:13:00.000Z	lonejack	Dr_Willis	probably removed important row
2010-10-24T14:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lonejack	 perhaps hit google to find a normal default file.. mine is customized for this system. I can pastebinit...
