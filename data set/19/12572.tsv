2007-02-14T08:53:00.000Z	deb_user		hey...is there anyway to rollback an update?
2007-02-14T08:53:00.000Z	deb_user		i get choppy graphics after an update
2007-02-14T08:54:00.000Z	Toma-	deb_user	you can hope that your /var/cache/apt directory didnt get cleaned, and install the old .deb file
2007-02-14T08:55:00.000Z	Toma-	deb_user	well, start rolling back :)
2007-02-14T08:56:00.000Z	Toma-	deb_user	find the biggest number of a package, -1, then install it?
2007-02-14T08:58:00.000Z	Toma-	deb_user	thatll work too
2007-02-14T08:58:00.000Z	Toma-	deb_user	id install the ones from BEFORE things got bad
2007-02-14T09:01:00.000Z	Toma-	deb_user	yeh, youll have to install the ones from before the date that you installed the bad packages...
2007-02-14T09:01:00.000Z	Toma-	deb_user	well thats going to be hard.
2007-02-14T09:02:00.000Z	Toma-	deb_user	what the real problem?
2007-02-14T09:04:00.000Z	Toma-	deb_user	and theyre broken... whats the working version number?
2007-02-14T09:07:00.000Z	Toma-	deb_user	so youre still using the working ati driver? and its locked?
2007-02-14T09:09:00.000Z	Toma-	deb_user	dapper has all the same versions as edgy, afaik
2007-02-14T09:11:00.000Z	Toma-	deb_user	when it comes to ati, im at a loss.
2007-02-14T09:12:00.000Z	Toma-	deb_user	all i can really suggest it running the absolute latest drivers from ati.
2007-02-14T09:13:00.000Z	Toma-	deb_user	good idea. also, if you can throw them anymore info, it will be worth it in the long run
2007-02-14T09:13:00.000Z	Toma-	deb_user	no probs. wish i could have done more
2007-02-14T09:13:00.000Z	Toma-	deb_user	you could test install on an extra partition?
2007-02-14T09:14:00.000Z	Toma-	deb_user	okie dokie :>
