2012-03-12T20:48:00.000Z	pfifo	races	what was your original question?
2012-03-12T20:49:00.000Z	pfifo	races	how long is 'long'
2012-03-12T20:53:00.000Z	pfifo	races	is there any paticular place in the boot sequence that it hangs for a 'long' time? you may need to boot without 'quiet splash' to get feedback
2012-03-12T20:59:00.000Z	races	pfifo	it doesnt look like any particular process is taking too long. According to what i read, the gray line means the process is iddle, so i dont understand why it takes so long
2012-03-12T21:02:00.000Z	pfifo	races	is it waiting for drives/partitions to become available that arent connected to your system?
2012-03-12T21:04:00.000Z	races	pfifo	That question is way over my knowledge. What is the easy way to know if the system is waiting for drives/partitions?
2012-03-12T21:04:00.000Z	pfifo	races	look at /etc/fstab and see if any drives are missing
2012-03-12T21:09:00.000Z	races	pfifo	there are two drives missing /dev/sda5 and /dev/sda6... what shoud I do?
2012-03-12T21:09:00.000Z	pfifo	races	can youi pastebin youe fstab, let me check it before I advise you
2012-03-12T21:11:00.000Z	races	pfifo	Do you want me to send you the link here?
2012-03-12T21:11:00.000Z	pfifo	races	yes please

2012-03-12T21:14:00.000Z	pfifo	races	no sda5 and 6 are you root and swap, their not missing. and thats not why your system is taking time too boot. are you running any extra startup scripts on boot? whats in your /etc/rc.local
2012-03-12T21:17:00.000Z	races	pfifo	I am very sorry for malinterpreting the file. My rc.local does nothing it only says exit 0... do you want me to copy it and paste it on pastebin?
2012-03-12T21:19:00.000Z	pfifo	races	no thats the default. I dont see anything that could be slowing your boot process, are you sure something is slowing it down? have you ever booted a different linux distro faster?
2012-03-12T21:21:00.000Z	races	pfifo	When I intalled ubuntu, it used to boot in 20 seconds (no more), now it is taking 1 minutes and 20 seconds. I dont know whether this time is normal or not, but it has relatively increased since I installed ubuntu on this computer.
2012-03-12T21:23:00.000Z	pfifo	races	unless you can identify a problem in the startup, theres not much more I can do, you could try reinstalling, and keep track of the changes you make, so that if it happens again youll be able to say what package is the culprit
2012-03-12T21:25:00.000Z	races	pfifo	Thank you very much. I think I am going to reinstall from 0 the new distribution 12.05 when it comes out. In the meantime I am going to keep this for a while. I do appreciate your help.. thanks
