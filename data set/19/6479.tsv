2009-02-06T15:10:00.000Z	oz1		Help , im getting Failed to bring up eth1. Im using 3 NIC the first as dchp server
2009-02-06T15:10:00.000Z	oz1		anyone?
2009-02-06T15:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	oz1	sudo ifup <interface name>
2009-02-06T15:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	oz1	if it doesnt come up, read dmesg through to make sure the nic's are detected ok
2009-02-06T15:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	oz1	ok then run lshw -C network
2009-02-06T15:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	oz1	you may need to install a differrent driver for it
2009-02-06T15:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	oz1	as long as the ips do not clash, the device should still at least come up
2009-02-06T15:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	oz1	if you pull the other 2 nics down, does eth1 come up?
2009-02-06T15:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	oz1	looks like you need a driver
2009-02-06T15:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	oz1	lspci
2009-02-06T15:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	oz1	is that te one that wont come up?
2009-02-06T15:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	oz1	then get websearching for ubuntu drivers for that device
2009-02-06T15:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	oz1	or how to set it up (may just need a package or two)
2009-02-06T15:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	oz1	i cant think of anything, as long as the card is getting an irq
2009-02-06T15:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	oz1	you could super test by physically removing the NICs
2009-02-06T15:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	oz1	if the nic STILL doesnt come up we know for sure that it needs a driver
2009-02-06T15:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	oz1	then you will need to setup their ip addresses appropriately
2009-02-06T15:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	oz1	not sure
2009-02-06T15:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	oz1	then you need drivers m'boy
