2012-05-10T11:54:00.000Z	stevedtrrrrm		error message is:- "This kernel requires the following features not present on the CPU :- pae"
2012-05-10T11:55:00.000Z	HowDoI	stevedtrrrrm	have you installed the VB kernel modules?
2012-05-10T11:57:00.000Z	HowDoI	stevedtrrrrm	did you recently update the linux kernel on your machine?  Virtualbox always needed to reload the kernel module after I did that
2012-05-10T11:59:00.000Z	HowDoI	stevedtrrrrm	so your windows host is complaining about not having pae, or your Ubuntu guest OS?
2012-05-10T12:01:00.000Z	HowDoI	stevedtrrrrm	weird.  Most computers have had pae support for decades, apparently
2012-05-10T12:02:00.000Z	HowDoI	stevedtrrrrm	have you tried booting the Ubuntu CD directly, without virtualbox?
2012-05-10T12:03:00.000Z	HowDoI	stevedtrrrrm	so you're just mounting the .iso in Windows?  You could try a USB stick
2012-05-10T12:21:00.000Z	HowDoI	stevedtrrrrm	enabling pae might cause a problem with your Windows installation though... be warned
2012-05-10T12:28:00.000Z	HowDoI	stevedtrrrrm	why do you even need pae on a guest OS?  Is your guest OS the 32-bit version of Ubuntu?  Are you certain it's not Ubuntu Server?
2012-05-10T12:32:00.000Z	HowDoI	stevedtrrrrm	you can maybe try the minimal iso version as per: http://www.webupd8.org/2012/05/how-to-install-ubuntu-1204-on-non-pae.html
