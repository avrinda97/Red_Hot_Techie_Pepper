2007-08-16T10:05:00.000Z	mushroomjay		Er.. No.
2007-08-16T10:05:00.000Z	mushroomjay		I could take a screen shot if you'd like.
2007-08-16T10:06:00.000Z	mushroomjay		Ok, there.
2007-08-16T10:06:00.000Z	mushroomjay		All right, and then I can drag and drop the icon where I please?
2007-08-16T10:07:00.000Z	mushroomjay		Ok.
2007-08-16T10:07:00.000Z	mushroomjay		Make link is phased out.
2007-08-16T10:08:00.000Z	mushroomjay		No, the "make link" option isn't available. I see it but it's in grey text.
2007-08-16T10:10:00.000Z	mushroomjay		Thanks anyway Kazol, and flash, you're talking about the multimedia tab in applications, and the "Sound & Video" tab, right?
2007-08-16T10:10:00.000Z	mushroomjay		No, it's not there.
2007-08-16T10:11:00.000Z	mushroomjay		Perhaps it's something with the GUI based install?
2007-08-16T10:11:00.000Z	c0ldfus10n	mushroomjay	- sounds like you may not have root access or something
2007-08-16T10:12:00.000Z	c0ldfus10n	mushroomjay	 - not sure how that happened.
2007-08-16T10:13:00.000Z	c0ldfus10n	mushroomjay	-  I don't know everything you are trying to do, but have you tried using the command line?
2007-08-16T10:14:00.000Z	c0ldfus10n	mushroomjay	are you trying to create a shortcut to something on your desktop?
2007-08-16T10:15:00.000Z	c0ldfus10n	mushroomjay	- open up a terminal window and do cd /home/(your username)
2007-08-16T10:18:00.000Z	c0ldfus10n	mushroomjay	- got it?
2007-08-16T10:19:00.000Z	c0ldfus10n	mushroomjay	in your Desktop directory there, type sudo ln -s /home/     <just as an example>
2007-08-16T10:20:00.000Z	c0ldfus10n	mushroomjay	- you should then see a new link on your desktop
2007-08-16T10:27:00.000Z	c0ldfus10n	mushroomjay	- whatcha got
