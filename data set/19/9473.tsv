2007-01-17T14:29:00.000Z	zarul		but  too bad I need something more than text-based  browser
2007-01-17T14:29:00.000Z	zarul		I have  modified firefox cache size
2007-01-17T14:29:00.000Z	zarul		but still never make me  tha happy yet
2007-01-17T14:30:00.000Z	zarul		lol
2007-01-17T14:31:00.000Z	zarul		I never use links2 for gui
2007-01-17T14:31:00.000Z	zarul		lol
2007-01-17T14:32:00.000Z	zarul		firefox is getting heavier day  by day
2007-01-17T14:33:00.000Z	zarul		firefox used to be  the best browser on   this old machine
2007-01-17T14:33:00.000Z	zarul		but  now, it is getting worse...
2007-01-17T14:34:00.000Z	zarul		but maybe there is something new out  there which I missed...
2007-01-17T14:34:00.000Z	wilsoniya	zarul	they just gotta lay off the features for a while and concentrate on perf.
2007-01-17T14:34:00.000Z	wilsoniya		nobody wants to do that cuz its either too hard or not cool
2007-01-17T14:34:00.000Z	zarul	wilsoniya	exactly
2007-01-17T14:35:00.000Z	zarul		for me performance is more important than having a cool  features
2007-01-17T14:35:00.000Z	zarul		I  think they should make 2  version  of firefox
2007-01-17T14:35:00.000Z	zarul		one is for performance
2007-01-17T14:35:00.000Z	wilsoniya		EnsignRedShirt: thats a negative
2007-01-17T14:35:00.000Z	zarul		and the other with  mambo jumbo  features
2007-01-17T14:35:00.000Z	wilsoniya	zarul	not a bad idea
