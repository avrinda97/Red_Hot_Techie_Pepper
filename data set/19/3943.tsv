2012-09-12T12:25:00.000Z	Dayofswords	oren_	what is the .tar.gz of?
2012-09-12T12:25:00.000Z	oren_		it has a file called "install" in the folder but it doesn't do anything. I've even executed it as a program but the terminal just flashes up for a second and nothing happens
2012-09-12T12:25:00.000Z	oren_		it s gqcam-0.9
2012-09-12T12:27:00.000Z	Dayofswords	oren_	The standard way to compile is   ./configure; make            if you want to install that to the system do     make install    but i'm not sure how make install function
2012-09-12T12:28:00.000Z	oren_	Dayofswords	I have no idea what that all means, I'm a real rookie with linux. Do you mean go to the terminal and just type that stuff or...?
2012-09-12T12:31:00.000Z	Dayofswords	oren_	in the terminal go to the folder(using cd /path/to/gqcam-0.9) and do   "./configure" without the quotes. chances are you'll hit some errors though so try that for now
2012-09-12T12:31:00.000Z	oren_		oh okay
2012-09-12T12:31:00.000Z	oren_		will do
2012-09-12T12:32:00.000Z	oren_		nothing
2012-09-12T12:33:00.000Z	oren_		hmm wait a moment
2012-09-12T12:34:00.000Z	oren_		I do cd /home/gqcam/ but it says no such file or directory
2012-09-12T12:34:00.000Z	oren_		when there obviously is
2012-09-12T12:34:00.000Z	oren_		am i doing something wrong?
2012-09-12T12:35:00.000Z	Dayofswords	oren_	where is the file? in your home folder?
2012-09-12T12:35:00.000Z	oren_		the file is in /home/gqcam
2012-09-12T12:36:00.000Z	oren_		but I can't get into that folder via the terminal
2012-09-12T12:36:00.000Z	oren_		oh okay I'll try that
2012-09-12T12:36:00.000Z	oren_		ah there we go
2012-09-12T12:36:00.000Z	Dayofswords	oren_	cant be, /home/ is for user folders, it has to be within it
