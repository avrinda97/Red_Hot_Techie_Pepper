2009-10-24T13:30:00.000Z	psinetic	jitender	it might be best if you used Thunderbird for email
2009-10-24T13:31:00.000Z	psinetic	jitender	what is preventing you from installing it?
2009-10-24T13:32:00.000Z	psinetic	jitender	go into terminal, and type this:
2009-10-24T13:33:00.000Z	jitender	psinetic	next step
2009-10-24T13:34:00.000Z	psinetic	jitender	what do you mean next step? it should install
2009-10-24T13:34:00.000Z	psinetic	jitender	did it install it already?
2009-10-24T13:36:00.000Z	psinetic	jitender	also, if you can't find an alternative of the windows-based program that uses .exe, you can run .exe (windows based apps) emulated in ubuntu using wine
2009-10-24T13:40:00.000Z	psinetic	jitender	now check in applications and thunderbird should be there
2009-10-24T13:41:00.000Z	psinetic	jitender	no problem :)
