2010-06-07T12:23:00.000Z	mgiammarco		Hi, I have an old pc where ubuntu 8.04 works perfectly. I have upgraded to 10.04 and I have also tried with live cd: when I login with a new user the upper and lower panel are empty and the panels do not reach the right part of the screen
2010-06-07T12:23:00.000Z	mgiammarco		what can I do?
2010-06-07T12:24:00.000Z	mgiammarco		I am getting crazy it is a very strange problem
2010-06-07T12:26:00.000Z	mgiammarco		it is strange because also with livecd it is the same so it is not a fault during installation or upgrade
2010-06-07T12:27:00.000Z	mgiammarco		yes, after login
2010-06-07T12:27:00.000Z	mgiammarco		I get an upper panel and a lower panel
2010-06-07T12:28:00.000Z	mgiammarco		but they are empty!
2010-06-07T12:28:00.000Z	theadmin	mgiammarco	Oh? Does hitting Alt+F2 give anything?
2010-06-07T12:28:00.000Z	theadmin	mgiammarco	...something's extremely weird there
2010-06-07T12:28:00.000Z	theadmin	mgiammarco	Wait wait - is this an issue for a single user or for all users?
2010-06-07T12:29:00.000Z	mgiammarco	theadmin	in livecd it happens for live user
2010-06-07T12:30:00.000Z	theadmin	mgiammarco	Oh... so not a config/permission issue :/
2010-06-07T12:30:00.000Z	mgiammarco	theadmin	in the hard disk installation (started from 8.04 and now upgraded to 10.04)
2010-06-07T12:30:00.000Z	mgiammarco	theadmin	it does it only for some users
2010-06-07T12:30:00.000Z	mgiammarco	theadmin	the users that have personalized a lot the desktop works
2010-06-07T12:31:00.000Z	mgiammarco	theadmin	users with standard theme do not work. I have created a new user and it does not work too
2010-06-07T12:31:00.000Z	theadmin	mgiammarco	Okay, that's something EXTREMELY weird :/
2010-06-07T12:31:00.000Z	theadmin	mgiammarco	Out of ideas
2010-06-07T12:32:00.000Z	mgiammarco	theadmin	thanks anyway
