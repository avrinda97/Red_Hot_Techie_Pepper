2010-05-31T23:05:00.000Z	magik		Does anyone know how i can stretch a borderless form??????????
2010-05-31T23:07:00.000Z	jonathan__	magik	What do you mean by form?
2010-05-31T23:07:00.000Z	magik	jonathan__	My terminator is borderless and i was wondering how i can make it wider?
2010-05-31T23:08:00.000Z	jonathan__	magik	you might be able to use wmctrl (after installing it) to alter it's size via command line, though I'm not sure.
2010-05-31T23:08:00.000Z	magik	jonathan__	How do i get it?
2010-05-31T23:09:00.000Z	jonathan__	magik	it should just be "sudo apt-get install wmctrl"
2010-05-31T23:10:00.000Z	magik	jonathan__	Ok i got it now what?
2010-05-31T23:12:00.000Z	jonathan__	magik	read over this page.  http://tripie.sweb.cz/utils/wmctrl/
2010-05-31T23:15:00.000Z	jonathan__	magik	I think viewport there is referring to the user of multiple desktops.. I don't think that's what you want.
2010-05-31T23:19:00.000Z	magik	jonathan__	not really but i could experiment
2010-05-31T23:20:00.000Z	jonathan__	magik	alright.  Try this command in a terminal:  "wmctrl -r :SELECT: -e 0,0,0,300,300"
2010-05-31T23:21:00.000Z	jonathan__	magik	once you run that, your cursor will change.  Click on the window you want to resize and it should be resized.
2010-05-31T23:22:00.000Z	jonathan__	magik	you can change what you want the window size to be by switching the last two numbers around as you wish.  the 300's at the end are the width and height, respectively.
2010-05-31T23:24:00.000Z	magik	jonathan__	cheers =] thats great exactly what i wanted thanks a lot!
2010-05-31T23:25:00.000Z	jonathan__	magik	no problem.  I also noticed that the command I sent you resets the window to the (0,0) position on the screen.. that can also be fixed by changing the second and third 0's in the command to whatever you wish. :)
2010-05-31T23:26:00.000Z	magik	jonathan__	Yeah i noticed that also, thanks a lot man I really appreciate it =]
2010-05-31T23:27:00.000Z	jonathan__	magik	not a problem.  I'm glad you were able to find what you needed. :)
2010-05-31T23:27:00.000Z	magik	jonathan__	I've been using ubuntu and xubuntu for about a month now and I'm just getting used to it. I love it much more than windows.
2010-05-31T23:29:00.000Z	jonathan__	magik	that's great! :)
