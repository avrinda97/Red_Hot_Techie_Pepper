2009-10-30T03:46:00.000Z	Yos		Guys, how can I get my internet connection to show up on networks so that I can browse the internet;'
2009-10-30T03:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Yos	how do you connect?
2009-10-30T03:47:00.000Z	Yos	ActionParsnip	, I use a usb modem
2009-10-30T03:49:00.000Z	Yos	ActionParsnip	I have it all set up already...I'm using it now to chat with you and I am updating I just can't browse is all
2009-10-30T03:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Yos	you may need to define name servers in /etc/resolv.conf
2009-10-30T03:53:00.000Z	Yos	ActionParsnip	and what should I use for nameserver ?  IP address or something ?
2009-10-30T03:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Yos	yes you'll need an ip
2009-10-30T03:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Yos	gksudo gedit /etc/resolv.conf
2009-10-30T03:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Yos	add these lines:   nameserver 208.67.222.222
2009-10-30T03:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Yos	nameserver 208.67.220.220
2009-10-30T03:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Yos	when you have added the lines, run: sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart
2009-10-30T03:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Yos	you will now have DNS servers
2009-10-30T04:04:00.000Z	Yos	ActionParsnip	I followed each of those steps but it didn't solve the problem
2009-10-30T04:07:00.000Z	Yos	ActionParsnip	Do you have any other ideas about what I can do ?
2009-12-12T20:51:00.000Z	Yos	ActionParsnip	do you still have that lp link that you gave me a few days ago?  I have no sound at startup

2009-12-12T21:10:00.000Z	Yos	ActionParsnip	thank you.  FYI, my alsa-utils was in /sbin and the line to comment out was #377
