2006-06-14T05:11:00.000Z	chapium		anyone here know  of a linux publishing program?  (ability to import .pub files would be good too)
2006-06-14T05:12:00.000Z	LjL	chapium	scribus. don't think it imports from .pub
2006-06-14T05:33:00.000Z	LjL	chapium	i don't think you'll find *many* alternatives, though you'll probably find one or two. what about just using a word processor? those things can do a lot of layouting nowadays
2006-06-14T05:34:00.000Z	LjL	chapium	you can still isntall KWord if you like, you'll just get a few libraries with it (sudo aptitude install kword will allow you to remove them easily later)
2006-06-14T05:35:00.000Z	LjL	chapium	scribus itself is a Qt/KDE program, so it'll have installed some of those already
2006-06-14T05:35:00.000Z	chapium	LjL	I here you need to install another library to make qt not look gross.  Do you know which one it is? (its kde related)
2006-06-14T05:36:00.000Z	LjL	chapium	wouldn't really know.. i'm using KDE, so that's the kind of problem I can have with *Gnome* programs ;-)
2006-06-14T05:36:00.000Z	LjL	chapium	but i think Dapper, by default, uses a reasonable enough theme for KDE inside Gnome... at least I think it did for me when I last tried
2006-06-14T05:37:00.000Z	LjL	chapium	perhaps you could install qt3-qtconfig, that will allow you to select from a (limited) set of (not-very-good) themes
2006-06-14T05:38:00.000Z	LjL	chapium	i like it better as a concept -- it's less bloated, both from a performance and a GUI-cluttering point of view... however, it crashes
2006-06-14T05:39:00.000Z	LjL	chapium	i try to use koffice whenever i can, but i end up having openoffice installed too most of the time
2006-06-14T05:39:00.000Z	chapium	LjL	if its faster, and compatible with the ms documents we are fed, it should be nice since this is a low end system
2006-06-14T05:40:00.000Z	LjL	chapium	it's certainly faster to load... i think it's also faster during operation
2006-06-14T05:41:00.000Z	LjL	chapium	for a low end system, you could also give AbiWord a try. it's surely more stable than KWord, though it's probably the one with the smallest feature set (but good enough for many purposes)
2006-06-14T05:42:00.000Z	LjL	chapium	on the other hand, i'm not sure kword is a good choice for a low end system that's running *Gnome*. it'll mean loading up the KDE libraries *as well* as the gnome libraries, which will probably make startup time go up, and keep more RAM filled
2006-06-14T05:43:00.000Z	LjL	chapium	kde doesn't crash *too* much in my experience, although koffice itself certainly does. konqueror crashes a bit too much these times (at least here), but it's very fast to recover with the "Crash" plug-in, if nothing else
2006-06-14T05:44:00.000Z	LjL	chapium	i dunno about that, scribus is *intended* for layouting, while kword is intended as a word processor -- though it's actually much more layout-oriented that openoffice writer
2006-06-14T05:44:00.000Z	LjL	chapium	scribus certainly looked kind of ugly/unintuitive when i tried it
2006-06-14T05:44:00.000Z	chapium	LjL	its very very glithcy
