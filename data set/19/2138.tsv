2010-10-15T05:56:00.000Z	Skaperen		SD cards will work (I use a 16GB SDHC card with a full installed system on it for my Asus netbook)
2010-10-15T05:58:00.000Z	Da_Wrecka	Skaperen	The Acer Aspire One is apparently not one of those
2010-10-15T05:58:00.000Z	Skaperen	Da_Wrecka	not one in what respect?  how is it different (I don't have one)
2010-10-15T05:59:00.000Z	Skaperen	Da_Wrecka	oh ... hmmm ... in Linux what does the SD come up as for a device name?
2010-10-15T05:59:00.000Z	Da_Wrecka	Skaperen	Not sure offhand. One second.
2010-10-15T06:00:00.000Z	Skaperen	Da_Wrecka	of course at that point it may be possible to use an external memory card reader that connects via USB
2010-10-15T06:00:00.000Z	Da_Wrecka	Skaperen	/dev/mmcblkXp1, the X being either 0 for the left-hand reader or 1 for the right-hand reader.
2010-10-15T06:00:00.000Z	Da_Wrecka	Skaperen	Oh yeah, I could do that.
2010-10-15T06:01:00.000Z	Skaperen	Da_Wrecka	hmmm ... my Dell laptop at work comes up like that ... but its BIOS does boot from SD ... guess it's a different BIOS
2010-10-15T06:06:00.000Z	Skaperen	Da_Wrecka	all my SD readers at home come up like any SATA/SCSI/USB drive does
2010-10-15T06:06:00.000Z	Da_Wrecka	Skaperen	Like /dev/sdX or something similar?
2010-10-15T06:07:00.000Z	Skaperen	Da_Wrecka	just to have choice handy ... like why do people need to have 10000 hours of MP3s
2010-10-15T06:07:00.000Z	Skaperen	Da_Wrecka	I loan them out at work sometimes, for example ... I suppose I don't really need the Kubuntu ones since only one person at work likes it
2010-10-15T06:08:00.000Z	Da_Wrecka	Skaperen	the card in my USB reader comes up as /dev/sde1... Apparently the internal readers are treated differently, and that's probably why they aren't bootable.
2010-10-15T06:12:00.000Z	Skaperen	Da_Wrecka	nope ... I just tried -netbook- and put -desktop- back over it
2010-10-15T06:12:00.000Z	Skaperen	Da_Wrecka	so basically, I didn't spend enough time with it to be motived to find that
2010-10-15T06:12:00.000Z	Da_Wrecka	Skaperen	Nuts. I kinda like the netbook launcher, I just don't like the fact that the icons are huge and have large, unnecessary spaces between them.
2010-10-15T06:13:00.000Z	Skaperen	Da_Wrecka	that was my thought when I did try it ... wanted them to be about 75% of the size they were, and tighter
2010-10-15T06:14:00.000Z	Skaperen	Da_Wrecka	maybe I will try it again when I get stuff backed up off my other netbook
