2010-05-16T16:45:00.000Z	TheMusicGuy	shashwatpns	what do you mean?
2010-05-16T16:46:00.000Z	shashwatpns	TheMusicGuy	: I mean ubuntu studios irc was just empty so i thought i would found help about it in #ubuntu
2010-05-16T16:47:00.000Z	TheMusicGuy	shashwatpns	you can turn a Ubuntu installation into a UbuntuStudio install by installing the package ubuntustudio-desktop
2010-05-16T16:48:00.000Z	shashwatpns	TheMusicGuy	: I have already done that
2010-05-16T16:49:00.000Z	TheMusicGuy	shashwatpns	that depends on what you're trying to do with the MIDI input data.
2010-05-16T16:50:00.000Z	TheMusicGuy	shashwatpns	lmms can connect midi input to its instruments.
2010-05-16T16:51:00.000Z	shashwatpns	TheMusicGuy	: For the first time have i connected my casio ctk-710 to a linux machine. How do I know whether Ubuntu has identified or not
2010-05-16T16:53:00.000Z	TheMusicGuy	shashwatpns	well, if you just want to acknowledge that something happened when you plugged it in, assuming its a USB midi adapter you're using, you can type `tail -f /var/log/messages` into a command prompt and watch the output for anything about a MIDI device. Try unplugging it and plugging it in again.
2010-05-16T16:55:00.000Z	TheMusicGuy	shashwatpns	I guess I should have started by asking, how does the MIDI keyboard physically connect to the computer?
2010-05-16T16:55:00.000Z	shashwatpns	TheMusicGuy	: What do you mean by " Physically Connect" ?
2010-05-16T16:57:00.000Z	shashwatpns	TheMusicGuy	& Stereocaulon : I mean Definetly USB
2010-05-16T16:59:00.000Z	shashwatpns	TheMusicGuy	: I have connected now how do i record?
2010-05-16T16:59:00.000Z	TheMusicGuy	shashwatpns	You want to record the MIDI input, or just the audio of the keyboard speakers?
2010-05-16T17:00:00.000Z	TheMusicGuy	shashwatpns	ok. well, there are a wealth of different things you can do with MIDI input. "record" is kind of a vague term here.
2010-05-16T17:01:00.000Z	TheMusicGuy	shashwatpns	its kind of complicated. you will probably begin by starting a JACK server with the command `jackd`.
2010-05-16T17:03:00.000Z	TheMusicGuy	shashwatpns	From there, you have to start one of the MANY applications available for MIDI input. You can check out Rosegarden, LMMS, ZynAddSubFx, or any combination thereof.
2010-05-16T17:03:00.000Z	TheMusicGuy	shashwatpns	I find LMMS fairly easy to use and configure.
2010-05-16T17:04:00.000Z	shashwatpns	TheMusicGuy	:Ya its really great
