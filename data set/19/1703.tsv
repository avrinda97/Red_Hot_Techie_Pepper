2010-10-27T09:18:00.000Z	digital_838		Why does Ubuntu download packages during installation?  Isn't everything on the CD?
2010-10-27T09:18:00.000Z	digital_838		But I didn't check the option to download updates.
2010-10-27T09:19:00.000Z	digital_838		So why would it download them anyway?
2010-10-27T09:19:00.000Z	digital_838		Yes
2010-10-27T09:19:00.000Z	digital_838		Ok thanks.
2010-10-27T09:20:00.000Z	digital_838		And last question... Is PulseAudio working ok for you guys?
2010-10-27T09:20:00.000Z	digital_838		Ok thanks again
2010-10-27T09:21:00.000Z	digital_838		I cannot play World of Warcraft anymore using Wine with whatever PulseAudio changes happened between 10.4 and 10.10
2010-10-27T09:21:00.000Z	digital_838		The sound lasts about 30 seconds, starts stuttering and then just quits entirely.
2010-10-27T09:21:00.000Z	digital_838		Is there a #Wine channel?
2010-10-27T09:21:00.000Z	Gnea	digital_838	#winehq
2010-10-27T09:22:00.000Z	digital_838	Gnea	do you use Alsa instead of Pulse Audio?
2010-10-27T09:22:00.000Z	Gnea	digital_838	yes
2010-10-27T09:23:00.000Z	digital_838	Gnea	 It's all stable and good even after removing PulseAudio?
2010-10-27T09:23:00.000Z	Gnea	digital_838	on my systems, yes
2010-10-27T09:23:00.000Z	Gnea	digital_838	there are some soundcards that require pulseaudio for full use, though
2010-10-27T09:25:00.000Z	digital_838	Gnea	 I could be wrong, but it seems to me that PulseAudio is lagging my whole system.  I get lots of messages in /Var/Logs/Messages and the system gets periods of sluggishness for a few seconds and then it just goes away.  Like I could type, and my input is being buffered and not displayed.  After a few seconds, everything catches up.  I want to see if this is PulseAudio causing this.
2010-10-27T09:26:00.000Z	Gnea	digital_838	unfortunately, pulseaudio hasn't been designed within ubuntu very well to do proper detection, it just blindly assumes that it will work
2010-10-27T09:28:00.000Z	Gnea	digital_838	pulseaudio is a daemon, not a kernel module. it sits on top of alsa, basically
