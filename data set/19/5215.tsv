2010-01-06T02:58:00.000Z	dooglus_		can someone tell me a reliable way to find out how big a directory is please?
2010-01-06T02:58:00.000Z	dooglus_		"du" doesn't work for me
2010-01-06T02:59:00.000Z	guntbert	dooglus_	whats wrong with du -sh <directory> ?
2010-01-06T03:00:00.000Z	dooglus_	guntbert	it lies.  hugely underestimates the space used.  tells me a 165MB file takes '0M'
2010-01-06T03:01:00.000Z	guntbert	dooglus_	it doesn't "lie" - maybe there are soft links in the file system
2010-01-06T03:01:00.000Z	dooglus_	guntbert	it's a single file
2010-01-06T03:01:00.000Z	dooglus_	guntbert	I gzipped it to see if it was 'sparse'.  it stayed 165MB
2010-01-06T03:02:00.000Z	dooglus_	guntbert	I made a pastebin 'cos people wouldn't believe me earlier either: http://paste.ubuntu.com/351842/
2010-01-06T03:02:00.000Z	dooglus_	guntbert	notice the '1', showing it's not a softlink
2010-01-06T03:03:00.000Z	dooglus_	guntbert	that's what the last guy said, too
2010-01-06T03:04:00.000Z	guntbert	dooglus_	confess: you made that up :-)
2010-01-06T03:04:00.000Z	dooglus_	guntbert	nope, it's not the case :)
2010-01-06T03:05:00.000Z	dooglus_	guntbert	I have another 175MB file that shows as 70M or so :)
2010-01-06T03:05:00.000Z	dooglus_	guntbert	du lies, I tell you!
2010-01-06T03:05:00.000Z	guntbert	dooglus_	the problem really interests me - but here it is way past bedtime - sorry
2010-01-06T03:06:00.000Z	dooglus_	guntbert	I'll give you a clue if you like...
2010-01-06T03:07:00.000Z	dooglus_	guntbert	when I in installed ubuntu 9.10, it asked if I wanted to encrypt my home folder.  I told it I did.
2010-01-06T03:07:00.000Z	dooglus_	guntbert	so none of my files are as they seem, I guess.  could that be what's causing the porkies?
2010-01-06T03:08:00.000Z	dooglus_	guntbert	here's some more output: http://paste.ubuntu.com/351979/
