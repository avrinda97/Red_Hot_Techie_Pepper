2008-10-12T08:21:00.000Z	teadict		what's the better way to clean a compiled source installation?
2008-10-12T08:22:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	teadict	No, chaddy's suggestions are the convention
2008-10-12T08:23:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	teadict	For debian/Ubuntu packages, use "fakeroot debian/rules clean"
2008-10-12T08:23:00.000Z	teadict	IntuitiveNipple	what could have possibly gone wrong if the package doesn't go away after a make clean?
2008-10-12T08:23:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	teadict	"go away" ??
2008-10-12T08:24:00.000Z	teadict	IntuitiveNipple	get cleaned.. for example.. not that is the most important issue, but the menu links are still there
2008-10-12T08:24:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	teadict	OH! You don't mean the source code at all! You mean the installed binary package?
2008-10-12T08:24:00.000Z	teadict	IntuitiveNipple	but a package installed by compiling its source
2008-10-12T08:25:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	teadict	What package / application is it you're working with?
2008-10-12T08:25:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	teadict	Usually, the source will have a target to uninstall: "sudo make uninstall"
2008-10-12T08:25:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	teadict	If you're not sure, open the source-code's Makefile and look for any target name that suggests it uninstalls the package
2008-10-12T08:27:00.000Z	teadict	IntuitiveNipple	the source from which i configured and "made" the package is gone.. downloaded it again.. so I should re-./configure it, right?
2008-10-12T08:27:00.000Z	teadict	IntuitiveNipple	with same prefix
2008-10-12T08:28:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	teadict	I'd guess so, to recreate the Makefile, yes, then you an look for an uninstall target
2008-10-12T08:28:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	teadict	Yes, same configure options
2008-10-12T08:28:00.000Z	teadict	IntuitiveNipple	will do
2008-10-12T08:29:00.000Z	teadict	IntuitiveNipple	worked.. must've done something wrong first time.. ty guys
2008-10-12T08:30:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	teadict	great, glad you got it sorted :)
2008-10-12T08:30:00.000Z	teadict	IntuitiveNipple	see ya :)
