2009-11-21T09:22:00.000Z	rikupw		oops, this isn't c, \n doesnt' work haha
2009-11-21T09:23:00.000Z	rikupw	gasull	not sure whats the problem, it just suddenly stopped working.  did an apt-get update/etc and suddenly nothin's workin.  any what the problem could be?
2009-11-21T09:24:00.000Z	rikupw		well, the issue could have been there for a while, as i hadn't untar'd anything for a while.  :-/  happens on both tar and tar.gz.  haven't tried bzip
2009-11-21T09:25:00.000Z	gasull	rikupw	I don't know, but try this:   sudo aptitude install --reinstall gzip
2009-11-21T09:25:00.000Z	rikupw		thanks gasull, i did try that i'll try that again
2009-11-21T09:25:00.000Z	rikupw		error:  gzip: stdin: not in gzip format tar: Child returned status 1 tar: Exiting with failure status due to previous errors \n i've tried uninstalling reinstalling :-/  no go.
2009-11-21T09:25:00.000Z	rikupw		thats the problem
2009-11-21T09:26:00.000Z	rikupw		no matter what it is, bzip (just tried), tar, tar.gz, all the same error related to the compression
2009-11-21T09:26:00.000Z	gasull	rikupw	also  aptitude install --reinstall tar
2009-11-21T09:26:00.000Z	rikupw		thanks :-)
2009-11-21T09:27:00.000Z	gasull	rikupw	did it work now?
2009-11-21T09:27:00.000Z	rikupw		no, forgot to say sudo :P
2009-11-21T09:28:00.000Z	rikupw		same error gasull :(
2009-11-21T09:30:00.000Z	rikupw		ok that worked, thanks gasull apparently i typed "tar" twice with apt-get.  reinstalling gzip worked this time around.
2009-11-21T09:30:00.000Z	gasull	rikupw	I'm glad :)
