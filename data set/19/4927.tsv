2008-10-20T22:12:00.000Z	smoovep		i cannot see eth1 under ifconfig
2008-10-20T22:13:00.000Z	smoovep		i can see the NIC card under dmesg loaded as e100 module, but not listed in ifconfig
2008-10-20T22:13:00.000Z	smoovep		Any IDEAS?
2008-10-20T22:14:00.000Z	smoovep		is there a network tool to setup eth1 ?
2008-10-20T22:16:00.000Z	Kr0ntab	smoovep	how many NIC's do you have?
2008-10-20T22:16:00.000Z	smoovep	Kr0ntab	: yes
2008-10-20T22:17:00.000Z	Kr0ntab	smoovep	lshw -C net
2008-10-20T22:17:00.000Z	Kr0ntab	smoovep	that command will tell you the logical names the cards are identified by...
2008-10-20T22:18:00.000Z	smoovep	Kr0ntab	The card is loaded as module e100 .. i can see it also as intel under lspci and dmesg... but nothing under ifconfig
2008-10-20T22:19:00.000Z	Kr0ntab	smoovep	did you run that command I told you?
2008-10-20T22:19:00.000Z	Kr0ntab	smoovep	lspci -C net
2008-10-20T22:19:00.000Z	smoovep	Kr0ntab	yes. and it shows logical name eth1 ..
2008-10-20T22:20:00.000Z	smoovep	Kr0ntab	Yep.. its there.. if i reboot, will it go away?
2008-10-20T22:21:00.000Z	Kr0ntab	smoovep	it just means your nic is not configured or turn on.  "ifconfig eth1" demonstrates that your NIC is there... you just need to do something with it.
2008-10-20T22:21:00.000Z	Kr0ntab	smoovep	what is your goal.. if eth0 is up and working...  what do you want to do with eth1?
2008-10-20T22:22:00.000Z	smoovep	Kr0ntab	i want it to be my main NIC .. dhcp
2008-10-20T22:22:00.000Z	Kr0ntab	smoovep	cool.. then you need to configure it as your primary NIC...
2008-10-20T22:22:00.000Z	Kr0ntab	smoovep	brb mate...
2008-10-20T22:29:00.000Z	Kr0ntab	smoovep	in /etc/network/interfaces you should have one line that says "auto eth0"... just change that to "auto eth1"... reboot... and make sure your e100 nic is plugged in...
