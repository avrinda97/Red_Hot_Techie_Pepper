2007-10-29T01:10:00.000Z	PirateHead	naxa	maybe you're suffering from the bug that makes Ubuntu kill hard drives. Tons of people have been affected.
2007-10-29T01:11:00.000Z	naxa	PirateHead	is that true?! uh.. .what is it?
2007-10-29T01:11:00.000Z	PirateHead	naxa	On many people's machines, Ubuntu makes the hard drive go through a load/unload operation a minute, or more, which wears the hard drive down really fast.
2007-10-29T01:11:00.000Z	PirateHead	naxa	you can install smartmontools and see how many loads/unloads your hard drive has gone through versus how many hours your computer has been use to determine whether you're being affected by the hard drive bug.
2007-10-29T01:12:00.000Z	naxa	PirateHead	is there a solution?
2007-10-29T01:12:00.000Z	naxa	PirateHead	I'll try this...
2007-10-29T01:12:00.000Z	PirateHead	naxa	if that bug is causing you applications to crash, the solution would be to get a new hard drive -- so it's a good idea to use smartmontools and check it out
2007-10-29T01:13:00.000Z	naxa	PirateHead	could you help me? Now I will download smartmontools and install
2007-10-29T01:13:00.000Z	naxa	PirateHead	After that it would be more secure if you could assist me :) I'm a bit new to these things
2007-10-29T01:13:00.000Z	PirateHead	naxa	I'll help.
2007-10-29T01:16:00.000Z	PirateHead	naxa	how's it going?
2007-10-29T01:17:00.000Z	naxa	PirateHead	uh I'm trying my best I think smartmontools installed but I also downloading 7.04 becouse it worked yesterday...
2007-10-29T01:17:00.000Z	naxa	PirateHead	smartmontools is ready what should I do?
2007-10-29T01:18:00.000Z	naxa	PirateHead	I started smartd
2007-10-29T01:18:00.000Z	PirateHead	naxa	run this command: sudo smartctl -a /dev/sda | grep Load_Cycle_Count
2007-10-29T01:18:00.000Z	PirateHead	naxa	and tell me what it says
2007-10-29T01:19:00.000Z	naxa	PirateHead	193 Load_Cycle_Count        0x0032   253   253   000    Old_age   Always       -       0
2007-10-29T01:20:00.000Z	PirateHead	naxa	that seems to indicate that your hard drive isn't counting the number of times it's load cycling, or doesn't have load cycling enabled at all
2007-10-29T01:20:00.000Z	PirateHead	naxa	in that case, I don't know how to check as to whether the hard drive bug is affecting you -- but it seems less likely
