2010-01-13T13:12:00.000Z	EastDallas		Does anyone know what the format is for the Calendar link in gnome-about-me (System>Preferences>About Me) in the Personal Info tab?  I tried iCal, but it doesn't seem to work.  XML?
2010-01-13T13:13:00.000Z	MenZa	EastDallas	What do you mean?
2010-01-13T13:13:00.000Z	MenZa	EastDallas	It just links to a calendar. If you want to add a calendar, you can do so in, say, Evolution and it'll show up in your clock applet and in Evolution itself.
2010-01-13T13:14:00.000Z	MenZa	EastDallas	Evolution definitely takes iCal, and a number of other common formats.
2010-01-13T13:14:00.000Z	EastDallas	MenZa	When you open 'About Me' in the Personal info tab, there's a place to enter a url for a calendar.
2010-01-13T13:14:00.000Z	EastDallas	MenZa	I don't use Evolution.
2010-01-13T13:14:00.000Z	MenZa	EastDallas	Correct. What are you attempting to achieve by adding the calendar?
2010-01-13T13:14:00.000Z	EastDallas	MenZa	SO I guess no luck
2010-01-13T13:15:00.000Z	EastDallas	MenZa	Trying to get it to work with the panel applet like the Evolution calendar does.
2010-01-13T13:16:00.000Z	MenZa	EastDallas	Well, Evolution comes with a cute little program (called evolution-webcal, I /think/), which adds it to the panel.
2010-01-13T13:16:00.000Z	MenZa	EastDallas	I believe it's in /usr/lib/evolution/something
2010-01-13T13:17:00.000Z	EastDallas	MenZa	But that means I'll have to open Evolution occassionally to get it to update correct?
2010-01-13T13:17:00.000Z	MenZa	EastDallas	No, no
2010-01-13T13:17:00.000Z	MenZa	EastDallas	That's what makes that thing so clever. You don't need to.
2010-01-13T13:17:00.000Z	MenZa	EastDallas	It's not in the PATH, though, and I forget what it's called.
2010-01-13T13:20:00.000Z	EastDallas	MenZa	 I should use the url to the iCal format?
2010-01-13T13:20:00.000Z	MenZa	EastDallas	yup
2010-01-13T13:20:00.000Z	MenZa	EastDallas	for example. /usr/lib/evolution-webcal/evolution-webcal http://example.com/calendar.ics
2010-01-13T13:23:00.000Z	EastDallas	MenZa	looks like it worked.  Thanks.
