2012-01-04T03:44:00.000Z	supasnashbuhl	shades	use checkinstall
2012-01-04T03:46:00.000Z	supasnashbuhl	shades	you can install checkinstall, then install it with checkinstall and remove it with apt-get remove afterwards
2012-01-04T03:47:00.000Z	supasnashbuhl	shades	got it?
2012-01-04T03:49:00.000Z	shades	supasnashbuhl	so, install checkinstall, re make && make all, then run chckinstall ?
2012-01-04T03:49:00.000Z	supasnashbuhl	shades	checkinstall will only help for the next time you manually install - it can't help with whatever you have installed right now.
2012-01-04T03:49:00.000Z	supasnashbuhl	shades	that's right
2012-01-04T03:57:00.000Z	supasnashbuhl	shades	for what? for checkinstall?
2012-01-04T03:58:00.000Z	shades	supasnashbuhl	no for synatpic
2012-01-04T03:59:00.000Z	supasnashbuhl	shades	ok.. what do you need synaptic for? Did removing the program work with checkinstall?
2012-01-04T03:59:00.000Z	shades	supasnashbuhl	I haven't got that far yet, I as going to need synatpic to 'install it properly'
2012-01-04T04:00:00.000Z	supasnashbuhl	shades	i thought you were installing from source?
2012-01-04T04:00:00.000Z	shades	supasnashbuhl	I was going to yes but someone else told me tha tI shouldn't do it that way
2012-01-04T04:00:00.000Z	supasnashbuhl	shades	yeah but if it's installed already, it's a bad idea to install another version "on top of it"
2012-01-04T04:01:00.000Z	supasnashbuhl	shades	best to get rid of your compiled version first. or things'll get even more messed up
2012-01-04T04:07:00.000Z	shades	supasnashbuhl	alright it's running now, we'll see if it uninstalled it or not
2012-01-04T04:07:00.000Z	supasnashbuhl	shades	what is running?
2012-01-04T04:07:00.000Z	shades	supasnashbuhl	what do I need to apt-get remove now?
2012-01-04T04:09:00.000Z	shades	supasnashbuhl	so I apt-get remove httpd_2.2.21-1_i386.deb?
2012-01-04T04:14:00.000Z	supasnashbuhl	shades	Try 'apt-get -f install' with no packages
