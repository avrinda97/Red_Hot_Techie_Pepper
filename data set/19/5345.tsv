2008-07-25T07:05:00.000Z	rockenrola	r0oter	do you have the Customlog command setup?
2008-07-25T07:08:00.000Z	r0oter	rockenrola	do you mean  CustomLog "/opt/var/apache2/log/access_log" combined
2008-07-25T07:08:00.000Z	rockenrola	r0oter	yes.
2008-07-25T07:09:00.000Z	r0oter	rockenrola	thats the one I have for access_log.The weird thing it was working hours ago
2008-07-25T07:09:00.000Z	rockenrola	r0oter	if you access your server, that file doesn't change ?
2008-07-25T07:09:00.000Z	r0oter	rockenrola	I kinda been testing apache restarting it couple times and then no more...
2008-07-25T07:10:00.000Z	r0oter	rockenrola	nop, I access couple pages but nothing...
2008-07-25T07:11:00.000Z	rockenrola	r0oter	paste the file that contains that line in pastebin.com
2008-07-25T07:14:00.000Z	r0oter	rockenrola	http://pastebin.com/d20d393f8
2008-07-25T07:17:00.000Z	r0oter	rockenrola	what u think it could be wrong?
2008-07-25T07:19:00.000Z	rockenrola	r0oter	I don't use mod_log_config in my apache
2008-07-25T07:21:00.000Z	rockenrola	r0oter	do you have any access.log file configured under a virtualhost ?
2008-07-25T07:22:00.000Z	r0oter	rockenrola	no, I dont have any virtualhost directive
2008-07-25T07:22:00.000Z	rockenrola	r0oter	humm, let me see what youn have then
2008-07-25T07:24:00.000Z	r0oter	rockenrola	according to apache it says that if I dont define any virtulhost then it should load log_config_module
2008-07-25T07:27:00.000Z	rockenrola	r0oter	where does it say that?
2008-07-25T07:27:00.000Z	r0oter	rockenrola	http://pastebin.com/d20d393f8 the commented lines
2008-07-25T07:32:00.000Z	rockenrola	r0oter	I see. I was thinking that you might have someother customlog overwriting that one
2008-07-25T07:33:00.000Z	rockenrola	r0oter	have you check the usal place: /var/log/apache2/ ?
