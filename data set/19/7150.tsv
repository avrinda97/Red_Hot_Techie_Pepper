2012-05-27T06:06:00.000Z	ace7		I can't see D and E partition
2012-05-27T06:06:00.000Z	ace7		does this mean all files on D and E are all deleted??
2012-05-27T06:07:00.000Z	yeats	ace7	linux doesn't use those letter designations like windows does
2012-05-27T06:11:00.000Z	yeats	ace7	did you pastebin what wilee-nilee asked you to?
2012-05-27T06:14:00.000Z	yeats	ace7	it's 'fdisk -l' not 'fdisk -1'
2012-05-27T06:17:00.000Z	yeats	ace7	it doesn't show on the screen
2012-05-27T06:18:00.000Z	yeats	ace7	you must be typing the password incorrectly
2012-05-27T06:21:00.000Z	yeats	ace7	those last two listed are windows partitions, so looks like you're probably okay
2012-05-27T06:22:00.000Z	yeats	ace7	what are you trying to do now?
2012-05-27T06:23:00.000Z	yeats	ace7	open nautilus (the file manager)... you should see the other partitions in the side panel
2012-05-27T18:33:00.000Z	yeats	ace7	you'll need to do that with a live CD (the ubuntu install CD has gparted on it)
