2009-04-03T13:04:00.000Z	rbo_		hello!
2009-04-03T13:04:00.000Z	rbo_		what's the difference between Hardy and Gutsy?
2009-04-03T13:05:00.000Z	Flannel	rbo_	Gutsy is 7.10, Hardy is 8.04.  Hardy is an LTS, supported for 3 years on the desktop.  Gutsy isn't.  It's also actually just about to go end of Life.  You definately should not be installing Gutsy at this point in time.
2009-04-03T13:06:00.000Z	rbo_	Flannel	LTS?
2009-04-03T13:07:00.000Z	Flannel	rbo_	Long Term Support.
2009-04-03T13:07:00.000Z	rbo_	Flannel	why is it supported for 3 years?
2009-04-03T13:07:00.000Z	Flannel	rbo_	Because it's an LTS release.
2009-04-03T13:07:00.000Z	rbo_	Flannel	what's going to happen after 3 years?
2009-04-03T13:08:00.000Z	Flannel	rbo_	well, the server is supported for 5.  But, when stuff goes EOL (end of life, at the end of the support term) it's not updated anymore.  No more security fixes, etc.  Non-LTS versions are only supported for 18 months.
2009-04-03T13:09:00.000Z	Flannel	rbo_	If you reinstlal what?
2009-04-03T13:10:00.000Z	rbo_	Flannel	the new copy of it
2009-04-03T13:10:00.000Z	Flannel	rbo_	Oh, a newer version?  Yes.  Although most people upgrade instead of reinstalling.
2009-04-03T13:10:00.000Z	rbo_	Flannel	or it doesn't matter as it's term of Hardy?
2009-04-03T13:11:00.000Z	rbo_	Flannel	term of life
2009-04-03T13:11:00.000Z	Flannel	rbo_	Hardy will be supported until 2011 (April).  10.04 will come out, and also be an LTS in April of 2010.  You can upgrade straight from LTS to LTS, so you can upgrade to 10.04 in a year when it comes out.
2009-04-03T13:11:00.000Z	rbo_	Flannel	ok, i go for Hardy
2009-04-03T13:12:00.000Z	Flannel	rbo_	Go with Hardy, yes.
2009-04-03T13:12:00.000Z	rbo_	Flannel	tnx
2009-04-03T13:12:00.000Z	rbo_	Flannel	i'd go for Gentoo, but we don't have a time
