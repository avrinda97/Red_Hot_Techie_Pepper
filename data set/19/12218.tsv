2006-08-14T12:30:00.000Z	soundray	datacrusher	can you restore your original /etc/X11/xorg.conf, then try startx again and check 'tail /var/log/Xorg.0.log'
2006-08-14T12:33:00.000Z	soundray	datacrusher	did you say this problem began after a power failure?
2006-08-14T12:34:00.000Z	soundray	datacrusher	if it was my system, I would back up all data files and do a fresh installation.
2006-08-14T12:36:00.000Z	soundray	datacrusher	boot a live CD, make a .tar for backup and copy it to one of the Windows drives
2006-08-14T12:45:00.000Z	soundray	datacrusher	you mean you can't mount the partition?
2006-08-14T12:46:00.000Z	soundray	datacrusher	no
2006-08-14T12:47:00.000Z	soundray	datacrusher	do it in the terminal -- you'll want to run tar in a terminal anyway.
2006-08-14T12:47:00.000Z	soundray	datacrusher	assuming hda1 is the partition you want to mount, the command is 'sudo mount /dev/hda1 /mnt'
2006-08-14T12:48:00.000Z	soundray	datacrusher	'sudo fdisk -l'
2006-08-14T13:01:00.000Z	soundray	datacrusher	are you sure the data you want is on the first partition of hda?
2008-08-14T18:08:00.000Z	soundray	datacrusher	some software is in inofficial repositories (e.g. Adobe Reader, Skype and Google Earth)
2008-08-14T18:09:00.000Z	soundray	datacrusher	others you have to compile from source -- checkinstall can be helpful for that
