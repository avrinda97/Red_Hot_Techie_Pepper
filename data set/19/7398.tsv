2007-10-03T07:11:00.000Z	soundray	adac	cat /proc/cpuinfo
2007-10-03T07:12:00.000Z	adac	soundray	thx! it shows me the right model...but only 800MHZ
2007-10-03T07:12:00.000Z	adac	soundray	thx! it shows me the right model...but only 800MHZ!?
2007-10-03T07:13:00.000Z	soundray	adac	that's fine, it means that speedstep or powernow has scaled down your frequency
2007-10-03T07:13:00.000Z	soundray	adac	it will go up on demand.
2007-10-03T07:13:00.000Z	adac	soundray	but why..it isn't running on battery right now
2007-10-03T07:13:00.000Z	adac	soundray	oh..i see :)

2007-10-03T07:14:00.000Z	adac	soundray	how nice it is to me that ubuntu:) it cares about my hardware;)
2007-10-03T07:15:00.000Z	soundray	adac	you can add the CPU Frequency Monitor applet to the panel and watch the frequency going up and down as you load your CPU
2007-11-06T05:35:00.000Z	soundray	adac	any processes hogging the CPU?
2007-11-06T05:36:00.000Z	soundray	adac	is it stuck at a reduced frequency?
2007-11-06T05:43:00.000Z	soundray	adac	can you give an example of what's slow?
2007-11-06T05:47:00.000Z	adac	soundray	opening apps for example. this takes simply to long. changing between apps and windows is slow as hell too
2007-11-06T05:48:00.000Z	soundray	adac	always or intermittently?
2007-11-06T05:50:00.000Z	soundray	adac	I understand
2007-11-06T05:57:00.000Z	soundray	adac	could your hard drive be failing?
