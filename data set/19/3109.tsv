2011-10-22T14:33:00.000Z	almoxarife	dngr	I am not understanding, when you boot up the machine stops at what point waiting for input?
2011-10-22T14:34:00.000Z	dngr	almoxarife	just a text terminal and bootup messages
2011-10-22T14:34:00.000Z	dngr		then i have to do alt-f1 and log in then start gdm manually
2011-10-22T14:35:00.000Z	almoxarife	dngr	this was on a fresh install or you made modifications?

2011-10-22T14:36:00.000Z	dngr		11.04 to 11.10
2011-10-22T14:38:00.000Z	almoxarife	dngr	I would suggest you re-install ubuntu-desktop, that should cover all the needed files who seem to be missing or corrupted
