2007-02-05T09:06:00.000Z	geeksauce		installing linux on the rents' computer cause i'm tired of fixing windows every day.  can it run on 128 ram?  and can i install from the live cd without booting into the live part first?
2007-02-05T09:07:00.000Z	genii	geeksauce	You'll need 192 on it to use the livecd regular iso install. but it runs on 128 fine. You can install by alternate cd with less that 192Mb
2007-02-05T09:11:00.000Z	genii	geeksauce	No, the minimalistic installer just isn't on it unfortunately.
2007-02-05T09:12:00.000Z	genii	geeksauce	What I normally do actually is get the server install cd which goes to a cli install. Then I do a   apt-get install ubuntu-desktop   and then it just goes for the rest over internet
2007-02-05T09:13:00.000Z	geeksauce	genii	 you mean run the server install cd from another pc on the network?
2007-02-05T09:15:00.000Z	genii	geeksauce	No, I mean use the server install cd to quickly get a basic system on the box. with little resources etc so usually successful. Then get whatever desktop you like installed  by way of the command apt-get install    kubuntu-desktop for KDE xubuntu-desktop for xfce or ubuntu-desktop for regular Gnome
2007-02-05T09:16:00.000Z	geeksauce	genii	will that install all the default packages and respective dependencies that are normally installed with the alternate ubuntu cd?
2007-02-05T09:16:00.000Z	genii	geeksauce	Yes
2007-02-05T09:18:00.000Z	geeksauce	genii	ok thanks.  their pc is a real heap.  celeron 466, 128 ram, 4 mb video... think i should install xununtu, or is that designed more to conserve hdd space?
2007-02-05T09:20:00.000Z	genii	geeksauce	Well, we have had a bit of debate earlier over that. but as for bang for the buck as goes a gui and usable, xubuntu is fine for something like that box is capable of
2007-02-05T09:21:00.000Z	geeksauce	genii	so will it run any faster that way?  is the only different the gui? xfce instead of gnome?
2007-02-05T09:22:00.000Z	genii	geeksauce	Basically the same sort of interface. in current xfce version tho, be warned is not intuitive how to make desktop shortcuts like in kde  or gnome tho.
2007-02-05T09:25:00.000Z	genii	geeksauce	Also by default gnome gdm login is installed, so you can put a minimalistic one if you like. i prefer wdm and then I uninstall gdm . It puts in a buinch on gnome stuff just to make the login screen pretty so I don't care to have it when I'm just going into xfce anyhow
2007-02-05T09:36:00.000Z	geeksauce	genii	second statement you lost me... i thought you were using gnome with a minimalistic login screen, then you said something about "when i'm going into xfce anhow"
2007-02-05T09:40:00.000Z	genii	geeksauce	wdm is a minimalistic x display manager. But even if you install only xubuntu-desktop for instance, it wants to pinstall a bunch of stuff gnome related just to give you gdm
2007-02-05T09:50:00.000Z	geeksauce	genii	ah ok.  either way i should use wdm though?  it's not gonna be passworded and there will only be one account other than root, so i'd set to autologin anyway
2007-02-05T09:51:00.000Z	genii	geeksauce	If only 1 account with autologin then you don't need a display manager. If it wants one by default then wdm is lightest.
2007-02-05T09:52:00.000Z	geeksauce	genii	gotcha, thanks.
