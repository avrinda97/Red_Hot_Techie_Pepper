2008-05-02T12:40:00.000Z	napnap_		I try to use java plugin with Hardy x64, I'm very sad because all my tests fails... :-( ...I've installed a 32bit version of firefox, with a 32bits JRE, then I created the symbolic link in the firefox plugin dir ... But all applets said me "Class not found". Anyone can tell me how to do please ?
2008-05-02T12:41:00.000Z	ikonia	napnap_	is your class path setup ?
2008-05-02T12:42:00.000Z	napnap_	ikonia	is not stupid :) lol, I will try
2008-05-02T12:45:00.000Z	napnap_	ikonia	I set the JAVA_HOME , CLASSPATH, and PATH but same error
2008-05-02T12:46:00.000Z	ikonia	napnap_	what class is it failing to load
2008-05-02T13:17:00.000Z	ikonia	napnap_	are you using a 32bit OS
2008-05-02T13:17:00.000Z	napnap_	ikonia	no, a 64 os
2008-05-02T13:17:00.000Z	ikonia	napnap_	the java plugin is a real effort with 64bit
2008-05-02T13:17:00.000Z	ikonia	napnap_	what class is failing ?
2008-05-02T13:18:00.000Z	napnap_	ikonia	all...specific class of the applet, not inner java class (the first attempt)
2008-05-02T13:19:00.000Z	ikonia	napnap_	can you just use the jvm to do say -version
2008-05-02T13:19:00.000Z	ikonia	napnap_	sounds like it's not got all the 32bit stuff it wants
2008-05-02T13:19:00.000Z	napnap_	ikonia	Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_06-b02)
2008-05-02T13:20:00.000Z	ikonia	napnap_	can you build a hello world class ?
2008-05-02T13:20:00.000Z	napnap_	ikonia	I will try... a moment.
2008-05-02T13:20:00.000Z	ikonia	napnap_	apologies this is overkill
2008-05-02T13:22:00.000Z	napnap_	ikonia	 I don't javac , I only the jre for the moment
2008-05-02T13:22:00.000Z	ikonia	napnap_	ah
2008-05-02T13:30:00.000Z	napnap_	ikonia	 I installed the jdk, compiled the class, then java test said me "Hello World", so it works
