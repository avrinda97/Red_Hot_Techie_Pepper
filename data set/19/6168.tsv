2008-05-08T01:55:00.000Z	sectech		updated kernel.... but people would have reported that....
2008-05-08T01:55:00.000Z	sectech		not being able to use the CDs
2008-05-08T01:57:00.000Z	sectech		hrmmm.... k I don't want to repeat my question.... I triage your bugs ppl lol lol
2008-05-08T01:58:00.000Z	ejer	sectech	do you know what drive controller you use? have you tried modprobing it
2008-05-08T01:59:00.000Z	sectech	ejer	I can't even get that far.... As soon as I put in the CD I get a initramfs prompt
2008-05-08T01:59:00.000Z	ejer	sectech	have u tried booting without quiet option
2008-05-08T02:00:00.000Z	ejer	sectech	the CD is bailing, nothing to do with hard drive from your description
2008-05-08T02:02:00.000Z	sectech	ejer	 I see where your coming from.... but I don't think it's the CD.... This one worked before.... brb
2008-05-08T02:02:00.000Z	ejer	sectech	not saying it is phys cd, but it is the cdrom or cd that is not booting
2008-05-08T02:03:00.000Z	ejer	sectech	unless i am misunderstanding, you are not trying to boot installed ubuntu correct? just livecd?
2008-05-08T02:04:00.000Z	sectech	ejer	it's just the livecd at the moment.....
2008-05-08T02:04:00.000Z	sectech	ejer	I am trying to boot without the quiet
2008-05-08T02:07:00.000Z	ejer	sectech	try booting with option acpi=off
2008-05-08T02:09:00.000Z	ejer	sectech	cabling was my next step ;)
2008-05-08T02:16:00.000Z	ejer	sectech	have you md5'd the cd?
2008-05-08T02:16:00.000Z	sectech	ejer	 no I haven't... but that's a good idea
2008-05-08T02:22:00.000Z	ejer	sectech	i don't get where the hard drive comes into the picture... until you want to install anyways
2008-05-08T02:22:00.000Z	sectech	ejer	Okay maybe I got two problems.... but it wasn't like this when I had my ata drive hooked up
2008-05-08T02:23:00.000Z	ejer	sectech	u can boot livecd with no hard drive installed even
