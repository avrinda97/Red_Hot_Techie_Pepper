2008-02-06T11:06:00.000Z	puff	user11_011	I've never really worked with jboss, but I've worked with java a bunch and been using ubuntu for a couple years.  I strongly suspect you'll be doing a manual install process for jboss.

2008-02-06T11:08:00.000Z	puff	user11_011	That's the jboss.org bug/feature tracking for a ubuntu package for jboss, looks liek they don'thave oney et.
2008-02-06T11:08:00.000Z	user11_011	puff	right. so is there no way?
2008-02-06T11:09:00.000Z	puff	user11_011	Of course there's a way, you just don't get debian/ubuntu's lovely "sudo aptitude install jboss".
2008-02-06T11:09:00.000Z	puff	user11_011	You have to do it the old-fashioned way.
2008-02-06T11:10:00.000Z	user11_011	puff	i tried building from source but for some java class  not fouind it fails to build
2008-02-06T11:10:00.000Z	puff	user11_011	JBoss has an installer, IRRC.
2008-02-06T11:11:00.000Z	puff	user11_011	Did you install the JDK?
2008-02-06T11:12:00.000Z	puff	user11_011	Are you familiar with java?  With jboss?

2008-02-06T11:12:00.000Z	puff	user11_011	Specifically http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=4031613
2008-02-06T11:13:00.000Z	puff	user11_011	That ubuntuforums URL looks like a pretty good step-by-step. It's from last year, but I don't see anything out of date for ubuntu in there.  I'mnot current enough on jboss to know.
2008-02-06T11:14:00.000Z	user11_011	puff	yes. i have sun java6 version
2008-02-06T11:14:00.000Z	puff	user11_011	Ah, well, check into the reported incompatibility between jboss and java 6, see if they fixed it.
2008-02-06T11:14:00.000Z	puff	user11_011	And are you sure you haave the _JDK_, not simply the JRE?
2008-02-06T11:15:00.000Z	puff	user11_011	Okay, gotta go, good luck.
2008-02-06T12:09:00.000Z	user11_011	puff	??
