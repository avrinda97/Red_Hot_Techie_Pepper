2010-02-06T19:02:00.000Z	Xanova		I kinda need your help. It seems that my network card (who used to work perfectly on windows, both ethernet and wifi) can't detect any wireless network. I'm connected with my eth, but i don't have any wlan option.
2010-02-06T19:04:00.000Z	Xanova		Hi there :) I got a wifi problem that i can't fix. My card is recognized by Ubuntu. It's a Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd. RTL-8139/8139C/8139C+ (rev 10) but i can't use the wireless option (no wlan0 option)

2010-02-06T19:09:00.000Z	Xanova		Please help me i don' know what else to do i've tried everyhing i could see on the internet...
2010-02-06T19:09:00.000Z	richthegeek	Xanova	update your system?
2010-02-06T19:10:00.000Z	richthegeek	Xanova	try a different wireless dongle?
2010-02-06T19:10:00.000Z	richthegeek	Xanova	yes, but the ISO will have been created at launch time back in October
2010-02-06T19:11:00.000Z	richthegeek	Xanova	search on amazon for "linux wireless dongle" or similar
2010-02-06T19:13:00.000Z	richthegeek	Xanova	it probably is. Try pluggin in the computer via a cable, running an update, and trying the dongle again
2010-02-06T19:15:00.000Z	Xanova	richthegeek	The thing is I don't have any dongle it's a wireless card in my mother card. (Please excuse my bad english, I'm europ√©an)
2010-02-06T19:15:00.000Z	richthegeek	Xanova	same idea anyway - connect via cable and update
2010-02-06T19:15:00.000Z	Xanova	richthegeek	You advice me to update my driver ?
2010-02-06T19:16:00.000Z	Xanova	richthegeek	Cause I've been looking for a linux driver for my card but I never found it...
2010-02-06T19:16:00.000Z	richthegeek	Xanova	your whole system
2010-02-06T19:16:00.000Z	Xanova	richthegeek	Aw ok
2010-02-06T19:16:00.000Z	richthegeek	Xanova	run the Update Manager until there are no more updates
2010-02-06T19:17:00.000Z	Xanova	richthegeek	Except some python or ubuntuone updates i don't have anything else...
2010-02-06T19:20:00.000Z	Xanova	richthegeek	Well i don't have any updates left.
