2010-05-24T22:38:00.000Z	bluelf		but it isnt running when i click run ActionParsnip
2010-05-24T22:40:00.000Z	sebsebseb	bluelf	depends on the program, where the files for it get stored,  and you woudn't normally need to know.  What you should know about though is hidden program user data in Home.
2010-05-24T22:46:00.000Z	sebsebseb	bluelf	try KOffice
2010-05-24T22:46:00.000Z	sebsebseb	bluelf	try Abiword and Gnumeric as well
2010-05-24T22:48:00.000Z	bluelf	sebsebseb	i used word 2010 its really great. will it work under wine ?, and i will definitely give them a try
2010-05-24T23:02:00.000Z	sebsebseb	bluelf	maybe you can help, their issue is that, the screen goes black when using sometimes, so I thought may need to install a graphics card driver
2010-05-24T23:03:00.000Z	bluelf	sebsebseb	is the graphic card installed ? Liara
2010-05-24T23:03:00.000Z	sebsebseb	bluelf	no Liara  hasn't installed a graphics card driver  them selves,  however heres a pastebin of the lspci which might be slightly useful  http://paste.ubuntu.com/438982/
2010-05-24T23:04:00.000Z	sebsebseb	bluelf	and system > administration > hardware drivers didn't show anything according to  Liara
2010-05-24T23:04:00.000Z	sebsebseb	bluelf	as I thought it woudn't if its ATI
2010-05-24T23:05:00.000Z	bluelf	sebsebseb	i did for me check ati site for compatibility
2010-05-24T23:05:00.000Z	sebsebseb	bluelf	sure, but they don't  know what card they have exactly,  I know theres a command of some sort, but don't remember what that is
2010-05-24T23:05:00.000Z	bluelf	sebsebseb	oh ..
2010-05-24T23:08:00.000Z	bluelf	sebsebseb	i think the command is sudo lspci |more
2010-05-24T23:17:00.000Z	sebsebseb	bluelf	reminder doing the graphics card driver from website, can be difficult for newbies.
2010-05-24T23:17:00.000Z	sebsebseb	bluelf	might have to tell them what to do with the file for the driver and all that
2010-05-24T23:37:00.000Z	sebsebseb	bluelf	I am going through stuff that was earlier looking for something,  and just saw something I missed before.  You can do Office 2010 online now by  the way, I assume it will also work with Linux distros.  Word, Powerpoint, and Excell online yes for free, on Microsoft's thing.  Plus theres the good and free Google Docs.
