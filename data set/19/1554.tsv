2011-04-30T01:58:00.000Z	lcb	ny51bern	check the scenarios there, you might get the one you need
2011-04-30T01:59:00.000Z	ny51bern	lcb	I'm not sure what GRUB i have
2011-04-30T01:59:00.000Z	lcb	ny51bern	btw, a2c4n9e1 receives a commission on every user i try to help, that's why
2011-04-30T01:59:00.000Z	ny51bern	lcb	i think I have grub 2, they only lst 1.99
2011-04-30T02:00:00.000Z	lcb	ny51bern	check the commands for grub :P that's how i learn
2011-04-30T02:00:00.000Z	lcb	ny51bern	on those pages there is one with the list of commands
2011-04-30T02:02:00.000Z	ny51bern	lcb	i really am not sure what to do..
2011-04-30T02:04:00.000Z	lcb	ny51bern	look, handling grub is not difficult. difficult and very risky is trying to help someone remotely, because you can easily screw everything. go slowly and with patience and you'll get it.
2011-04-30T02:04:00.000Z	lcb	ny51bern	unless someone else want to give a try, with this "confusion" in the #chan
2011-04-30T02:22:00.000Z	ny51bern	lcb	 theres a help button on the dialog when it asks me to choose that says " a new version of config file /etc/default/grub is avail, but the version installed has been locally modified
2011-04-30T02:22:00.000Z	ny51bern	lcb	that help?
2011-04-30T02:22:00.000Z	lcb	ny51bern	yes, sure
2011-04-30T02:23:00.000Z	ny51bern	lcb	any ideas?
2011-04-30T02:23:00.000Z	lcb	ny51bern	yes, update
2011-04-30T02:24:00.000Z	lcb	ny51bern	backup your /home dir to play on the safe side
2011-04-30T02:24:00.000Z	ny51bern	lcb	theres no option to update..?
2011-04-30T02:37:00.000Z	ny51bern	lcb	is that "install the package maintainer's version"
2011-04-30T02:37:00.000Z	ny51bern	lcb	option
