2007-05-29T11:32:00.000Z	gaten	REGJAVA	animated cube images, more options for window affects and such
2007-05-29T11:32:00.000Z	REGJAVA		ok , so its only the animations and the themes from Emerald
2007-05-29T11:33:00.000Z	REGJAVA		I love to use beryl, but it gives me the Black window Bug :(
2007-05-29T11:33:00.000Z	REGJAVA		so, i think i will stick with compiz
2007-05-29T11:34:00.000Z	gaten	REGJAVA	yeah that gets annoying,  i find that when i minimize the window and bring it back up the blackness goes away
2007-05-29T11:34:00.000Z	REGJAVA		it will keep u r desktop clean ., the rain
2007-05-29T11:34:00.000Z	REGJAVA	gaten	, thats soo irritating , but i never get those with compiz
2007-05-29T11:34:00.000Z	gaten		well that settles it; im moving the france!
2007-05-29T11:34:00.000Z	REGJAVA		I can sense the gdp of france going UP
2007-05-29T11:35:00.000Z	gaten	REGJAVA	yes, no one argues that compiz is more stable than beryl. hopefully the merge will fix that
2007-05-29T11:36:00.000Z	REGJAVA		Lets Hope for the best and hope the Merge will fix it!
2007-05-29T11:36:00.000Z	REGJAVA		Is the Black bug only with Nvidia cards?
2007-05-29T11:37:00.000Z	REGJAVA		Damn it! , i Shud have gone for an ATI
2007-05-29T11:37:00.000Z	REGJAVA		How abt Intel?
2007-05-29T11:37:00.000Z	gaten	REGJAVA	ati and linux NEVER mix. trust me, nvidia is the better choice
