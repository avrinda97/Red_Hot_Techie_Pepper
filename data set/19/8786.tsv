2007-02-07T09:46:00.000Z	Alucart		hello
2007-02-07T09:47:00.000Z	Alucart		is eanybody able to explaine me how i activate the fullduplex off my soundcard?
2007-02-07T09:48:00.000Z	bluefox83	Alucart	fullduplex?
2007-02-07T09:53:00.000Z	bluefox83	Alucart	whats the matter?
2007-02-07T09:56:00.000Z	Alucart	bluefox83	i am not able to hear music an play or talk in teamspeak
2007-02-07T09:57:00.000Z	bluefox83	Alucart	what kind of headset are you using?
2007-02-07T09:57:00.000Z	Alucart	bluefox83	it is a standard headdy
2007-02-07T09:57:00.000Z	bluefox83	Alucart	and your speakers and headset don't plug into the same hole?
2007-02-07T09:58:00.000Z	bluefox83	Alucart	i doubt it's a problem of drivers, i believe you have a seperate sound device for each output
2007-02-07T09:58:00.000Z	bluefox83	Alucart	i only use ubuntu ;)
2007-02-07T09:59:00.000Z	bluefox83	Alucart	yeah, i can do that now O.o
2007-02-07T09:59:00.000Z	bluefox83	Alucart	fullduplex probably creates a second sound device listing
2007-02-07T10:00:00.000Z	bluefox83	Alucart	no
2007-02-07T10:00:00.000Z	bluefox83	Alucart	it means you need to find out what all of your audio output /dev listings are, and then make sure teamspeak and your music player are pointing to different ones ;)
2007-02-07T10:01:00.000Z	bluefox83	Alucart	poke around man..that's how you learn...
2007-02-07T10:02:00.000Z	bluefox83	Alucart	i would try something like skype first, to check out your audio input/output stuff, while playing music in something like amarok or xmms ;)
2007-02-07T10:03:00.000Z	bluefox83	Alucart	it's not hard, just try different listings till something works
2007-02-07T10:03:00.000Z	bluefox83	Alucart	why not?
