2008-03-25T12:51:00.000Z	DistroJockey	GEIS	What sizes are the 2 hard drives?
2008-03-25T12:59:00.000Z	DistroJockey	GEIS	What mount point are you wanting to rename? And to what? And what device?
2008-03-25T13:02:00.000Z	DistroJockey	GEIS	hmm. Renaming / to /example is probably not a good idea
2008-03-26T11:35:00.000Z	DistroJockey	GEIS	"Renaming root is generally a bad idea"
2008-03-26T11:38:00.000Z	DistroJockey	GEIS	Not sure yet ;) Looking into it.  (sounds like a bad idea though)
2008-03-26T11:38:00.000Z	DistroJockey	GEIS	I know it is common on Windows to rename Administrator, so ...
2008-03-26T11:40:00.000Z	DistroJockey	GEIS	What is the reason you wish to change root?
2008-03-26T12:00:00.000Z	DistroJockey	GEIS	I guess deleting the file would do it. But it does have other stuff besides SSH
2008-03-26T12:01:00.000Z	DistroJockey	GEIS	make a copy first if you try :)
2008-03-26T12:02:00.000Z	GEIS	DistroJockey	why?
2008-03-26T12:03:00.000Z	DistroJockey	GEIS	well, I can't say what will happen when you delete it. And once it's gone, it's gone
2008-03-26T12:04:00.000Z	DistroJockey	GEIS	Well I just deleted mine, so far so good :)
2008-03-26T12:04:00.000Z	DistroJockey	GEIS	didn't make a backup either
