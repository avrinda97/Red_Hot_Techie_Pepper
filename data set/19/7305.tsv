2008-01-25T17:49:00.000Z	SleepingSloth	zetheroo	- are you installing from repos?
2008-01-25T17:49:00.000Z	zetheroo	SleepingSloth	sorry.... sometimes I post too early after opening the chat and my post does not actually get seen
2008-01-25T17:50:00.000Z	zetheroo	SleepingSloth	I added the repo and the key
2008-01-25T17:50:00.000Z	zetheroo	SleepingSloth	I am installing through Synaptic
2008-01-25T17:51:00.000Z	zetheroo	SleepingSloth	is elisa in the Ubuntu repo?
2008-01-25T17:52:00.000Z	zetheroo	SleepingSloth	I was told by someone else that I had to add a repo
2008-01-25T17:53:00.000Z	zetheroo	SleepingSloth	oh ok... I see that the Ubuntu repo has elisa media center there....
2008-01-25T17:53:00.000Z	zetheroo	SleepingSloth	but with the added repo you get elisa-extra which supposedly gives you the added features for iPod's etc
2008-01-25T17:57:00.000Z	SleepingSloth	zetheroo	- i see. i've just installed elisa from official repos - what repository are you using?
2008-01-25T18:00:00.000Z	zetheroo	SleepingSloth	do you have gutsy backport enabled?
2008-01-25T18:06:00.000Z	zetheroo	SleepingSloth	ok I got elisa installed
2008-01-25T18:07:00.000Z	zetheroo	SleepingSloth	well, I had to settle for the Ubuntu repo version
2008-01-25T18:07:00.000Z	zetheroo	SleepingSloth	thing is that now when I start Elisa it opens in a window and makes everything on my screen dissapear
