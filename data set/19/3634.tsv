2009-06-27T17:52:00.000Z	Manifest		I have an HP laptop that comes with touch sensitive music control buttons built in. They've been working fine, but now they're not. I've checked hardware drivers, and there's nothing there for this. How can I make them work again?
2009-06-27T17:54:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	Manifest	You might want to google "ubuntu community, HP <your model>" to see if there are anything about it.  Usually, there are pages dedicated to popular models.
2009-06-27T17:54:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	Manifest	Also, there are multimedia keys, but I'm not sure if that applies to you too.  Worth something to read.
2009-06-27T17:54:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	Manifest	There you go.  Good luck. :3
2009-06-27T17:55:00.000Z	Manifest	mobi-sheep	Thanks
2009-06-27T17:58:00.000Z	Manifest	mobi-sheep	The touch keys always used to work before though.
2009-06-27T17:59:00.000Z	Manifest	mobi-sheep	What would have happened to cause them to stop working? The only one that works is volume, and only the up/down. Mute doesn't work.
2009-06-27T17:59:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	Manifest	I don't really know.  Certain changes in updates is possible.
2009-06-27T18:00:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	Manifest	Did you check/find your HP page?
2009-06-27T18:00:00.000Z	Manifest	mobi-sheep	Looking now
2009-06-27T18:01:00.000Z	Manifest	mobi-sheep	Just updated a day ago, and that's when the problem started...so I'm gonna guess it was updates. anyway to do like a restore?
2009-06-27T18:03:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	Manifest	What model?
2009-06-27T18:03:00.000Z	Manifest	mobi-sheep	HP Pavilion DV9720US
2009-06-27T18:05:00.000Z	Manifest	mobi-sheep	Google search is looking pretty bland, no?
2009-06-27T18:06:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	Manifest	Still looking.  Laptop or PC?
2009-06-27T18:06:00.000Z	Manifest	mobi-sheep	Laptop
2009-06-27T18:08:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	Manifest	Another suggestion -- Come back at later time when somebody more knowledge is here and may help you with your issue or make a new thread and post your issue on Ubuntu Forum.
2009-06-27T18:10:00.000Z	Manifest	mobi-sheep	I've tried the Ubuntu forums many times. The only thing I get is other's posting their problems in my threads, and then my thread getting ignored after 3 days
2009-06-27T18:10:00.000Z	Manifest	mobi-sheep	I'll have to come back later then. Thanks for the help
