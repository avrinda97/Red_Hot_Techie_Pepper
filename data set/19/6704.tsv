2007-12-21T08:49:00.000Z	Lennalf		I'm setting up ubuntu for the first time on a home theatre PC... I am not sure how to get ubuntu to recognize my USB RF wireless keyboard...
2007-12-21T08:49:00.000Z	Lennalf		can anybody help?
2007-12-21T08:50:00.000Z	bazhang	Lennalf	does it require certain drivers--try plugging it in
2007-12-21T08:50:00.000Z	Lennalf	bazhang	it comes with drivers on a CD, but it was plug-and-play on Windows XP
2007-12-21T08:51:00.000Z	bazhang	Lennalf	plug in the base station and see if it works
2007-12-21T08:52:00.000Z	Lennalf	bazhang	sorry, base station?
2007-12-21T08:52:00.000Z	bazhang	Lennalf	how does the wireless connect? to the cpu? likely to a dongle that you plug into a usb port, yes?
2007-12-21T08:53:00.000Z	Lennalf	bazhang	yes it is a USB dongle.  It is listed in my hardware information screen
2007-12-21T08:54:00.000Z	Lennalf	bazhang	It sees a Wireless Keyboard/Mouse in my USB UHCI Controller #2
2007-12-21T08:54:00.000Z	bazhang	Lennalf	try syncing it with the keyboard--there should be buttons on both base station and keyboard that may need to be pressed simultaneously
2007-12-21T08:54:00.000Z	Lennalf	bazhang	hmm okay, I'll look...
2007-12-21T08:55:00.000Z	bazhang	Lennalf	so it works now? if it is recognized then just try using it--othewise try the sync
2007-12-21T08:55:00.000Z	Lennalf	bazhang	I'll try to sync... the button isn't clear.... one says ID...
2007-12-21T08:56:00.000Z	Lennalf	bazhang	no luck yet.  Thanks for your help btw :)
2007-12-21T08:57:00.000Z	bazhang	Lennalf	what keyboard by the way
2007-12-21T08:57:00.000Z	Lennalf	bazhang	It is the SpecResearch 01027; although the box actually says X-Gene :-P
2007-12-21T09:00:00.000Z	Lennalf	bazhang	yes :)
2007-12-21T09:01:00.000Z	bazhang	Lennalf	the writer of that article seems to suggest that it is no prob with ubuntu
2007-12-21T09:03:00.000Z	Lennalf	bazhang	yeah... hmm :(  I guess I'll just keep tinkering.  Thanks for the help though.
