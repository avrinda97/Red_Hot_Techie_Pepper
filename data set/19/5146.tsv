2008-12-19T06:51:00.000Z	Terralthra		I am trying to install gnome via apt-get on 8.04, and it fails because gnome depends on gnome-keyring-manager, which is apparently unavailable now
2008-12-19T06:51:00.000Z	Terralthra		ideas?
2008-12-19T06:52:00.000Z	lucent	Terralthra	replaced by "gnome-keyring"
2008-12-19T06:54:00.000Z	Terralthra	lucent	How do I get apt-get to recognize the package change?
2008-12-19T06:57:00.000Z	lucent	Terralthra	I have to think there's an easier way to do what you're ultimately wanting to do
2008-12-19T06:57:00.000Z	lucent	Terralthra	*why* are you installing gnome from apt?
2008-12-19T06:59:00.000Z	Terralthra	lucent	because I installed ubuntu from the minimal install CD
2008-12-19T06:59:00.000Z	lucent	Terralthra	oh.  well unless you're interested in wasting a lot of time, I suggest installing from the desktop cd ;)
2008-12-19T07:00:00.000Z	lucent	Terralthra	ah, I've been there mate... can it boot off USB?
2008-12-19T07:00:00.000Z	lucent	Terralthra	shame about that
2008-12-19T07:01:00.000Z	lucent	Terralthra	it does work, but it's not just like you can conjure up a few packages and have a full Desktop experience
2008-12-19T07:01:00.000Z	Terralthra	lucent	I am aware
2008-12-19T07:03:00.000Z	lucent	Terralthra	try "sudo apt-get install ubuntu-standard"
2008-12-19T07:03:00.000Z	lucent	Terralthra	try "sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop" instead then
2008-12-19T09:53:00.000Z	lucent	Terralthra	impressive
2008-12-19T09:54:00.000Z	Terralthra	lucent	is there a reasonable way to disable the nvidia thing?
2008-12-19T09:55:00.000Z	lucent	Terralthra	kill it with fire?    um... dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg maybe
2008-12-19T09:55:00.000Z	lucent	Terralthra	there's a command like that, I forgot the exact one
2008-12-19T11:31:00.000Z	lucent	Terralthra	I really don't know, I might joke about chuck norris and the time continuum, but really which bug?
