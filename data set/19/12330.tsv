2006-04-25T06:10:00.000Z	nalioth	rukuartic	NO. this is a smear attempt on that channel, they are not involved
2006-04-25T06:10:00.000Z	rukuartic	nalioth	Oh... whoops!
2006-04-25T06:11:00.000Z	rukuartic	nalioth	I was making a poor joke =\
2006-04-25T06:23:00.000Z	nalioth	rukuartic	the error msgs from w/e you are doing will advise what you need
2006-04-25T06:26:00.000Z	rukuartic	nalioth	Ask Axe for the error messages... says GCC can't build executables or something.
2006-04-25T06:29:00.000Z	rukuartic	nalioth	I'm just trying to figure out what I need... its build-essential, gcc, and what else?
2006-04-25T06:29:00.000Z	nalioth	rukuartic	try a version up or downstream of wine source

2006-04-25T06:30:00.000Z	rukuartic	nalioth	i was going to have him get source and checkinstall
2006-04-25T06:30:00.000Z	nalioth	rukuartic	build-esential and checkinstall are good basics to have
