2011-07-24T02:16:00.000Z	linux_noob		you mean what it caused to happen? cause i don't remember the error in terminal but it was something like could not locate even though it was there. i wouldn't want to try it again because it sometimes stopped ubuntu booting, or it would auto boot in safe graphics and if it did ever boot normally then everything gets so slow and stops responding
2011-07-24T02:18:00.000Z	linux_noob		a link to a wiki how to page?
2011-07-24T02:20:00.000Z	linux_noob		um, i confused, that page just explains what a how to page is...    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howto

2011-07-24T02:23:00.000Z	linux_noob		yup, thats the driver that totally wrecked natty, maverick and almost lucid aswell
2011-07-24T02:24:00.000Z	linux_noob		im looking for that link that explains why its not supported...
2011-07-24T02:25:00.000Z	linux_noob		the card used to be supported, but it just doesn't work
2011-07-24T02:27:00.000Z	linux_noob		from the amd site, its the desktop version, x series, x8xx series linux x86
2011-07-24T02:27:00.000Z	linux_noob		the card is the x800
2011-07-24T02:28:00.000Z	linux_noob		thats the thing, i think i am but how do i check if i am running the open source driver?
2011-07-24T02:28:00.000Z	Barnabas	linux_noob	install glxinfo
2011-07-24T02:29:00.000Z	Barnabas	linux_noob	try typing glxinfo in a terminal
2011-07-24T02:30:00.000Z	Barnabas	linux_noob	no the pkg is not called glxinfo
2011-07-24T02:31:00.000Z	Barnabas	linux_noob	that util is very very handy when fault finding your gpu driver
2011-07-24T02:33:00.000Z	Barnabas	linux_noob	try to do a glxinfo | grep vendor
2011-07-24T02:33:00.000Z	Barnabas	linux_noob	but use pastebin or paste.ubuntu.com
2011-07-24T02:37:00.000Z	Barnabas	linux_noob	looks like the oss drivers to me
2011-07-24T02:46:00.000Z	Barnabas	linux_noob	buing a new gpu sounds to me as the last resort
2011-07-24T02:48:00.000Z	Barnabas	linux_noob	could you msg me directly?
