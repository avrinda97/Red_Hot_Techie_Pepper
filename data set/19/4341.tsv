2010-08-19T05:42:00.000Z	pZombie		ok, after trying some time, i have to come back and ask again
2010-08-19T05:44:00.000Z	pZombie		did anyone in here manage to install 10.4 lucid lynx SERVER _from_ a bootable USB stick onto a computer without network access and without a CDrom drive?
2010-08-19T05:45:00.000Z	pZombie		Ke1ha mind sharing the knowledge? I came quite far.. using grub4dos with following entries find --set-root /ubu-s.iso
2010-08-19T05:45:00.000Z	pZombie		map /ubu-s.iso (hd32)
2010-08-19T05:45:00.000Z	pZombie		map --hook
2010-08-19T05:45:00.000Z	pZombie		chainloader (hd32)
2010-08-19T05:46:00.000Z	pZombie		it starts booting, but then gets stuck at the CDrom
2010-08-19T05:46:00.000Z	pZombie		which i read is normal, because a usb stick cannot do a full cdrom emulation
2010-08-19T05:47:00.000Z	pZombie		Ke1ha - why would the startup disk creator be useful? And how would i use it?
2010-08-19T05:49:00.000Z	pZombie		ke1ha - do you maybe use a special usb stick which can emulate a cdrom?
2010-08-19T05:49:00.000Z	turt1e	pZombie	 are you trying to USB boot a machine that doesn't have support for booting via USB in the bios?
2010-08-19T05:49:00.000Z	pZombie	turt1e	- i made a partition on my usb 250gb HDD, and i made it boot grub4dos
2010-08-19T05:58:00.000Z	turt1e	pZombie	 so explain to us the current state of the system as far as operating systems installed on it.  and how you got Grub loaded on it
2010-08-19T06:01:00.000Z	turt1e	pZombie	 ok, and just to be clear,  this system has no support for booting via USB in the bios right?
2010-08-19T06:03:00.000Z	turt1e	pZombie	 wait,  if you have a bios option that you can set the boot order to USB first I don't understand why you are using grub4dos
2010-08-19T06:25:00.000Z	pZombie	turt1e	- amazing, how easy unetbootin worked. it works
2010-08-19T06:27:00.000Z	pZombie	turt1e	- of course it killed my original MBR booting grub4dos, but that can be fixed easy later. i have one more question however if you happen to know. is what unetbootin does with one ISO, possible with many ISOs, so i can pick which ISO to install, or do i have to use unetbootin everytime i want to install a different ISO without the CD?
2010-08-19T06:27:00.000Z	turt1e	pZombie	 very cool, glad you got that resolved.  and I'll have to file unetbootin away for future use.  Hadn't seen that one before
2010-08-19T06:28:00.000Z	turt1e	pZombie	 I've never used unetbootin before
