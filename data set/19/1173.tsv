2011-12-21T07:04:00.000Z	TheHackOps		Just about to ask about 11.10, is it fast enough now to run on a medium speced laptop ?
2011-12-21T07:05:00.000Z	TheHackOps		as far as flgrx and unity
2011-12-21T07:05:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	TheHackOps	have to be more specific
2011-12-21T07:07:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	TheHackOps	wait don't
2011-12-21T07:07:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	TheHackOps	do a live image first. See how it runs. Then, if you use windows, try doing a wubi install.
2011-12-21T07:08:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	TheHackOps	ah nvm them. Still, try running through a live image.
2011-12-21T07:08:00.000Z	TheHackOps	kroq-gar78	Virtual box?
2011-12-21T07:08:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	TheHackOps	no. burn a Live CD or make a Live USB.
2011-12-21T07:09:00.000Z	TheHackOps	kroq-gar78	sometimes the images i download don't have the "Try" option i find it a hit and miss is their anyway to tell whats what
2011-12-21T07:09:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	TheHackOps	Probably means a corrupted image.
2011-12-21T07:10:00.000Z	TheHackOps	kroq-gar78	well it allways installs fine ;)
2011-12-21T07:10:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	TheHackOps	just means you have to re-download :(
2011-12-21T07:10:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	TheHackOps	oh, I don't know then.
2011-12-21T07:10:00.000Z	TheHackOps	kroq-gar78	Seem's some are guiless installers
2011-12-21T07:11:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	TheHackOps	that means you're downloading the wrong image
2011-12-21T07:11:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	TheHackOps	good luck!
2011-12-21T07:11:00.000Z	TheHackOps	kroq-gar78	whats the right image?
2011-12-21T07:11:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	TheHackOps	desktop something... ubuntu-11.10-desktop-i386.iso or whatever.
