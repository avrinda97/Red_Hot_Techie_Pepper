2005-06-11T13:41:00.000Z	sproingie		does xfce use the standard .desktop files?
2005-06-11T13:42:00.000Z	levander	sproingie	how is ubuntu weak on the server?
2005-06-11T13:42:00.000Z	sproingie	levander	no selinux, mostly
2005-06-11T13:43:00.000Z	levander	sproingie	what's selinux?
2005-06-11T13:44:00.000Z	sproingie	levander	thats mostly a debian weakness i guess.  tho debian shines other places for server work
2005-06-11T13:44:00.000Z	sproingie	levander	security enhanced linux.  sort of the de facto standard for secure linux installs these days
2005-06-11T13:44:00.000Z	levander	sproingie	do you think fedora is better for servers than ubuntu? and, if so, why?
2005-08-08T11:59:00.000Z	levander	sproingie	so, there's no perceived benefit of freezing features in the industry?
2005-08-08T11:59:00.000Z	sproingie	levander	feature freezes are a way of life in the industry.  they're a novelty in the open source world
2005-08-08T12:00:00.000Z	levander	sproingie	but if fedora seems no less stable than ubuntu, what's the point?
2005-08-08T12:00:00.000Z	sproingie	levander	the linux kernel itself is the worst offender.  a 0.0.1 release will make drastic changes to API's
2005-08-08T12:00:00.000Z	levander	sproingie	ah, didn't know that about the kernel
2005-08-08T12:01:00.000Z	sproingie	levander	it's stable, but how stable does it remain over time, and how easy is it to maintain over time, that's the question
2005-08-08T12:01:00.000Z	sproingie	levander	fc4 didn't even support the last kernel revision to support fglrx just before release.  i've no idea whether it made it in by release time or not
2005-08-08T12:02:00.000Z	levander	sproingie	but the way they do things, can't they release fglrx after they make their release?
2005-08-08T12:03:00.000Z	sproingie	levander	fat lot of good it does me if it doesn't work tho
2005-08-08T12:04:00.000Z	levander	sproingie	so, basically, your criticism of fedora isn't there release model, but that they don't stay on top of getting some applications packaged that you think they should?
2005-09-22T08:20:00.000Z	levander	sproingie	They have a guide on what you need to know?
2005-09-22T08:21:00.000Z	levander	sproingie	Or will by the time they realease breezy?
