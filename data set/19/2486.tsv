2010-04-14T23:54:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	toyman61	DivX-compatible doesnt mean anything
2010-04-14T23:57:00.000Z	toyman61	brontosaurusrex	: I will refine my question: I want to save it into a format which is playable on my home theater equipment. (MPEG 4 ASP?)
2010-04-14T23:57:00.000Z	toyman61	brontosaurusrex	: My home theater is capable of playing "DivX" (aka MPEG4 ASP?).
2010-04-14T23:57:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	toyman61	what player do you have?
2010-04-14T23:58:00.000Z	toyman61	brontosaurusrex	: Samsung HT-BD 1255
2010-04-14T23:58:00.000Z	toyman61	brontosaurusrex	: But it should also be playable on Samsung HT-BD2
2010-04-14T23:59:00.000Z	toyman61	brontosaurusrex	: I used Pinnacle Studio 11 on Windows XP before, and it was able to store videos in what they called "DivX"...  :-)
2010-04-14T23:59:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	toyman61	select xvid asp, make it two-pass, set desired bitrate, leave everything default, but you can raise 'motion search precision'
2010-04-14T23:59:00.000Z	toyman61	brontosaurusrex	: But DivX is not a format as such..
2010-04-15T00:00:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	toyman61	audio can be mp3, make it CBR
2010-04-15T00:01:00.000Z	toyman61	brontosaurusrex	: I'm using avidemux 2.5.1. but I'm not able to find xvid asp as a choice in the program ??!?!?
2010-04-15T00:02:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	toyman61	MPEG-4 ASP (Xvid)
2010-04-15T00:03:00.000Z	toyman61	brontosaurusrex	: I see.. :-))  I'll try that. Thanx!!  :-)
2010-04-15T00:03:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	toyman61	no problemo
2010-04-15T00:04:00.000Z	toyman61	brontosaurusrex	: Which is the best to choose: "Two pass - video size" or "Two pass - average bitrate" ?
2010-04-15T00:05:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	toyman61	this are the same thing quality-wise
2010-04-15T00:05:00.000Z	toyman61	brontosaurusrex	: OK. I'll try it out.
2010-04-15T00:09:00.000Z	toyman61	brontosaurusrex	: Does it matter which format I use ?  Should I use AVI, or is it better to use another format (MPEG4?) ?
