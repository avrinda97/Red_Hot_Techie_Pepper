2006-11-06T15:47:00.000Z	ChrisNiemy		hi, someone uses FLAC for music files? trying to play them with xine-backend and amarok. seems that its still not working under egdy. _can_ anybody here play FLAC under amarok (edgy eft)?

2006-11-06T15:48:00.000Z	cge	ChrisNiemy	You need to install xine-extracodecs
2006-11-06T15:48:00.000Z	ChrisNiemy	cge	did that, also tried from a fresh install. i must be crazy ;) refuses to work.
2006-11-06T15:49:00.000Z	ChrisNiemy	cge	so the problem concerning the xinelibs which occured under dapper is now fixed in edgy?
2006-11-06T15:49:00.000Z	cge	ChrisNiemy	I don't know. I think it was working. But flac works well with gstreamer.
2006-11-06T15:50:00.000Z	ChrisNiemy	cge	seems to work with rhythmbox :) just missing the crossfading-function of amarok
2006-11-06T15:50:00.000Z	cge	ChrisNiemy	amarok can use gstreamer.
2006-11-06T15:51:00.000Z	ChrisNiemy	cge	ok, then i have to check the settings there. I'll give it a try. thanks
2006-11-06T16:03:00.000Z	ChrisNiemy	cge	whoo, it works with amarok, had to delete the ~/.xine directory. and I guess the flac files which were produced by grip, had wrong parameters or so, another flac file which i made with soundconverter works.
2006-11-06T16:04:00.000Z	cge	ChrisNiemy	strange
2006-11-06T16:04:00.000Z	ChrisNiemy	cge	it is ;)
2006-11-06T16:10:00.000Z	ChrisNiemy	cge	i got it: in grip in the encoder section there are wrong parameters by default. i manually converted a wav with command-line flac and that works, though the with grip created flacs do work with gstreamer. however, thanks for listening ;))
2006-11-06T16:11:00.000Z	cge	ChrisNiemy	Interesting
2006-11-06T16:12:00.000Z	cge	ChrisNiemy	You should file a bug about it.
2006-11-06T16:13:00.000Z	ChrisNiemy	cge	ok, this morning im getting used to launchpad it seems ;)
2006-11-06T16:43:00.000Z	ChrisNiemy	cge	rm ~/.grip and rm ~/.xine was it. I must have messed the settings in grip.
2006-11-06T16:43:00.000Z	cge	ChrisNiemy	ah
2006-11-06T16:43:00.000Z	ChrisNiemy	cge	no bug
