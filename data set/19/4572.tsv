2008-12-20T10:28:00.000Z	brusteve		is there a way I can get a list of TTYs and switch from one to another through the command line?
2008-12-20T10:28:00.000Z	n2diy	brusteve	setserial, but you'll have to fetch it.
2008-12-20T10:30:00.000Z	brusteve	n2diy	thanks, i'll fetch it, check it out and read the man page - this will allow me to list or switch TTYs, or both?
2008-12-20T10:42:00.000Z	brusteve	n2diy	I'm a little confused I'm currently on /dev/pts/1 - how do I jump onto another TTY, this don't seem to work > setserial /dev/pts/0
2008-12-20T10:44:00.000Z	n2diy	brusteve	go pack to setserial, and select another comm, port. But I don't think setserial will play with a pts port?
2008-12-20T10:45:00.000Z	n2diy	brusteve	 what is a  pts port?
2008-12-20T10:46:00.000Z	brusteve	n2diy	well I wanted to know what TTW was being used by a shell so i typed in the command "tty"
2008-12-20T10:46:00.000Z	brusteve	n2diy	that outputed /dev/pts/1
2008-12-20T10:47:00.000Z	brusteve	n2diy	I wat to switch from one open shell terminal to another open shell terminal
2008-12-20T10:47:00.000Z	n2diy	brusteve	ttw? are you playing on a test box or mission critical box?
2008-12-20T10:47:00.000Z	brusteve	n2diy	test
2008-12-20T10:47:00.000Z	n2diy	brusteve	ok, cool.
2008-12-20T10:49:00.000Z	brusteve	n2diy	so how can I switch between each terminal on a machine to see what is going on inside it?
2008-12-20T10:52:00.000Z	n2diy	brusteve	cltr+alt+F1, F2, F3 etc....
2008-12-20T10:53:00.000Z	brusteve	n2diy	wow, you totally misunderstand what i'm trying to do
2008-12-20T10:53:00.000Z	n2diy	brusteve	not unsual. :)
2008-12-20T10:54:00.000Z	brusteve	n2diy	thanks for the effort though
2008-12-20T10:54:00.000Z	n2diy	brusteve	gl
2008-12-20T10:54:00.000Z	brusteve	n2diy	thx
