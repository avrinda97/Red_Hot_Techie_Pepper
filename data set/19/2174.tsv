2011-01-25T02:09:00.000Z	brontoeee	agentgasmask	try #ubuntu-server
2011-01-25T02:10:00.000Z	agentgasmask	brontoeee	warrenachild was the one asking about it. I will forward it allong
2011-01-25T02:11:00.000Z	agentgasmask	brontoeee	Rsync
2011-01-25T02:11:00.000Z	brontoeee	agentgasmask	yeah, something gui based i need
2011-01-25T02:14:00.000Z	agentgasmask	brontoeee	rsync's manual looks looming, but it realy is just: rsync -a -z --delete -e ssh <path to files to coppy> REMOTE-USER@REMOTEHOST:REMOTE-TARGET
2011-01-25T02:14:00.000Z	brontoeee	agentgasmask	i know rsync and its limitations
2011-01-25T02:15:00.000Z	agentgasmask	brontoeee	ok, then why were you asking for a backup solution if you already know what you need?
2011-01-25T02:15:00.000Z	brontoeee	agentgasmask	i know its NOT rsync
2011-01-25T02:15:00.000Z	agentgasmask	brontoeee	what don't you like about rsync?
2011-01-25T02:16:00.000Z	agentgasmask	brontoeee	ok, I think there is a GUI front end to rsync, let me check...
2011-01-25T02:17:00.000Z	agentgasmask	brontoeee	it looks like it is called grsync. I've never used it, but it's worth a shot.
2011-01-25T02:18:00.000Z	brontoeee	agentgasmask	then there is cron and all the backup logic i would need to write? grsync is just a basic gui for rsync
2011-01-25T02:19:00.000Z	agentgasmask	brontoeee	Are you looking to backup specific files, or a full system backup?
2011-01-25T02:20:00.000Z	brontoeee	agentgasmask	specific folders + home folder
2011-01-25T02:20:00.000Z	agentgasmask	brontoeee	the nice thing about rsync, is that it only copies the changes made to a file, and not the entire file for just the little change.
2011-01-25T02:21:00.000Z	agentgasmask	brontoeee	Setting up something like that would not be hard. It would basicly be a one-liner.
2011-01-25T02:21:00.000Z	brontoeee	agentgasmask	ok, but what if i need a file the way it was 3 days ago?
2011-01-25T02:23:00.000Z	brontoeee	agentgasmask	rsync is a production syncer, nothing more, and even then only one-way route
2011-01-25T02:26:00.000Z	agentgasmask	brontoeee	Yes, I see your point. My backup needs are such that I don't need that dynamic of a setup. You could look at Sun's ZFS. It has a roleback feature that alows you to take "snapshots" in time. They also don't take up much space.
