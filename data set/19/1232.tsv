2011-04-01T19:21:00.000Z	janolap1		Hi, I would like to know how I can configure my ubuntu server (10.10) to resolv the FQDN name of my other computers. I can do it from another ubuntu box (8.04), but I can't remember how I did this...
2011-04-01T19:22:00.000Z	meganerdca	janolap1	you could put entries in /etc/hosts
2011-04-01T19:22:00.000Z	meganerdca	janolap1	you could also setup a DNS server on your LAN, probably overkill... probably
2011-04-01T19:23:00.000Z	janolap1	meganerdca	: Ok, but on the other box, I didn't do that ...
2011-04-01T19:24:00.000Z	janolap1	meganerdca	: There's already a DNS on the LAN. But when I type "ping proxy" for example, my new server doesn't resolve
2011-04-01T19:25:00.000Z	janolap1	meganerdca	: but the old one does !
2011-04-01T19:25:00.000Z	meganerdca	janolap1	is this a business LAN?
2011-04-01T19:25:00.000Z	janolap1	meganerdca	: yes
2011-04-01T19:25:00.000Z	meganerdca	janolap1	check /etc/resolv.conf
2011-04-01T19:25:00.000Z	meganerdca	janolap1	there should be a line that says "search my.domain.tld"
2011-04-01T19:25:00.000Z	meganerdca	janolap1	also make sure that nameserver line points to the proper name servers
2011-04-01T19:26:00.000Z	janolap1	meganerdca	: it's the same ont the 2 hosts, and serach my.domain.tld is present (with the good value)
2011-04-01T19:26:00.000Z	meganerdca	janolap1	what happens when you type "host proxy"
2011-04-01T19:27:00.000Z	janolap1	meganerdca	: I'm trying
2011-04-01T19:27:00.000Z	meganerdca	janolap1	then compare to "host proxy <ip of dns server>"
2011-04-01T19:28:00.000Z	janolap1	meganerdca	: I'm reinstalling the system, hold on 2 minutes...
2011-04-01T19:28:00.000Z	meganerdca	janolap1	ok
2011-04-01T19:29:00.000Z	meganerdca	janolap1	I am going to go and get a coffee, BRB
2011-04-01T20:05:00.000Z	meganerdca	janolap1	try "host proxy <ip of dns server>
