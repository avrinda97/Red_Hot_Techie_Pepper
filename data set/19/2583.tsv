2010-03-05T06:33:00.000Z	neezer		I tried doing sudo cp -r .ssh /home/ryan, and it won't let me check to see if it copied properly. unop
2010-03-05T06:34:00.000Z	brjann	neezer	that's because /home/ryan/.ssh is now owned by root, since you copied it using sudo. try   sudo chown ryan:ryan /home/ryan/.ssh
2010-03-05T06:36:00.000Z	brjann	neezer	you might also need to explicitly set permissions on that directory, too, after you've chowned it:   chmod 700 /home/ryan/.ssh
2010-03-05T06:38:00.000Z	neezer	brjann	I still can get into the .ssh folder.
2010-03-05T06:39:00.000Z	brjann	neezer	openssh does not like it when anyone but the owner has read access to the .ssh directory.
2010-03-05T06:41:00.000Z	neezer	brjann	When I created the user, I used sudo adduser ryan, and went through the steps. then I looked in /home/ryan, and the only thing in it was desktop_examples. I think the rest of the folders are created on the first login.
2010-03-05T06:42:00.000Z	brjann	neezer	but you said you copied in the .ssh directory using     sudo cp -r .ssh /home/ryan
2010-03-05T06:43:00.000Z	brjann	neezer	right, that's what i'm saying. the .ssh directory you created (using sudo) is now owned by root. ryan can't write anything to it.
2010-03-05T06:44:00.000Z	neezer	brjann	I haven't even logged in as ryan. I want to get ssh access, but he needs a .ssh folder first right?
2010-03-05T06:44:00.000Z	brjann	neezer	if your sshd_config is set to only allow public key authentication, yes.
2010-03-05T06:45:00.000Z	brjann	neezer	where is his public key coming from?
2010-03-05T06:45:00.000Z	brjann	neezer	that's typically what I do, yes.
2010-03-05T06:46:00.000Z	brjann	neezer	only if you're giving him your private key. which I would not recommend.
2010-03-05T06:47:00.000Z	brjann	neezer	yes. ryan needs his own key, and needs some way to get the public key portion of his key added to .ssh/authorized_users
2010-03-05T06:47:00.000Z	brjann	neezer	yes, giving out your private key means he can log in as you.
2010-03-05T06:48:00.000Z	brjann	neezer	no, your private key lives on your laptop. on the server, there is a public key in .ssh/authorized_keys
2010-03-05T06:52:00.000Z	brjann	neezer	no problem. here's some reading material for you :) https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH/OpenSSH/Keys
2010-03-05T06:53:00.000Z	neezer	brjann	thanks for the link. it is used to be one of my bookmarks until I got my ssh up and running smoothly. now I just need to get his going.
2010-03-07T03:10:00.000Z	brjann	neezer	lucid support is in #ubuntu+1
