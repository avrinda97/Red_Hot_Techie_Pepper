2006-03-21T16:57:00.000Z	Titan		I can not get wine through synaptec, see I need to compile from source because I need to patch it to work with World of Warcraft.
2006-03-21T16:59:00.000Z	Titan		I have done that but get that first error I posted here when I try to run wine
2006-03-21T17:00:00.000Z	Titan		did you have a suggeston fluxt?
2006-03-21T17:00:00.000Z	fluxt	Titan	i'd like to know if this works

2006-03-21T17:01:00.000Z	Titan	fluxt	I have compiled wine and did sudo make install but I get this error                           titan@Titan:~/wine-0.9.9$ wine
2006-03-21T17:03:00.000Z	fluxt	Titan	so it compiles ok?
2006-03-21T17:03:00.000Z	Titan	fluxt	that is after running ./configure then make depend && make, then sudo make install.
2006-03-21T17:04:00.000Z	Titan	fluxt	well, I am not really sure it does, I am still kind of new to linux
2006-03-21T17:04:00.000Z	Titan	fluxt	yes I did.
2006-03-21T17:06:00.000Z	Titan	fluxt	thanks :)
