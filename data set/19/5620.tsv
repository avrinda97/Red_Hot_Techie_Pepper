2008-06-12T16:02:00.000Z	ikonia	the_eraser	there are multiple encoders, search synaptic for "encode" then pick the packag eyou want, plus the codec
2008-09-26T01:20:00.000Z	the_eraser	ikonia	ok
2008-09-26T01:19:00.000Z	ikonia	the_eraser	no
2008-09-26T01:19:00.000Z	ikonia	the_eraser	it's not been released, so it's not stable
2008-09-26T01:19:00.000Z	ikonia	the_eraser	it's not due out for another month
2008-09-29T16:27:00.000Z	ikonia	the_eraser	possibly because it's not been updated yet
2008-09-29T16:28:00.000Z	the_eraser	ikonia	this version has no album/artist browser :(

2008-09-29T16:29:00.000Z	the_eraser	ikonia	so there is need :(((
2008-09-29T16:29:00.000Z	ikonia	the_eraser	for you
2008-09-29T16:30:00.000Z	ikonia	the_eraser	for the mass majority, who knows, speak to the package mainterin to find out if there is a reason it's not been updated, or if it could be updated
2008-09-29T16:31:00.000Z	ikonia	the_eraser	why, who said it was updated in intrepid, speak tot he package maintainer
2008-09-29T16:33:00.000Z	ikonia	the_eraser	thats not causing trouble
2008-09-29T16:33:00.000Z	ikonia	the_eraser	asking if there is a reason it's not been updated is fine, making a request to have it updated, nothing wrong with that
2008-09-29T16:33:00.000Z	ikonia	the_eraser	just ask politly, and you'll find it not a problem
2008-09-29T16:34:00.000Z	the_eraser	ikonia	ok :)
