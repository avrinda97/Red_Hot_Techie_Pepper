2011-02-12T12:37:00.000Z	MaslowK		Hey guys, is this the official ubuntu help channel?
2011-02-12T12:38:00.000Z	ejv	MaslowK	yes
2011-02-12T12:44:00.000Z	ejv	MaslowK	which version of ubuntu?
2011-02-12T12:44:00.000Z	MaslowK	ejv	10/10
2011-02-12T12:45:00.000Z	ejv	MaslowK	uname -ra
2011-02-12T12:45:00.000Z	MaslowK	ejv	I havent used linux in years, im not familiar with that command
2011-02-12T12:45:00.000Z	ejv	MaslowK	just run it, it'll spit out your current kernel and architecture
2011-02-12T12:46:00.000Z	ejv	MaslowK	details you always want to include when describing a driver problem, FYI
2011-02-12T12:49:00.000Z	ejv	MaslowK	why reinstall?
2011-02-12T12:49:00.000Z	MaslowK	ejv	I uninstalled it after failing to figure out my wireless cards
2011-02-12T12:49:00.000Z	ejv	MaslowK	there's an easy fix, just requires going to the vendor website and doing some compiling
2011-02-12T12:50:00.000Z	ejv	MaslowK	i can't comment on wubi, having never used it
2011-02-12T12:50:00.000Z	ejv	MaslowK	but i don't believe so
2011-02-12T12:52:00.000Z	ejv	MaslowK	anyways i'd go to the realtek website and download the latest drivers
2011-02-12T12:55:00.000Z	ejv	MaslowK	latest driver from the vendor website is RTL8191SU_usb_linux_v2.6.6.0.20101111.zip
2011-02-12T12:55:00.000Z	ejv	MaslowK	should work perfectly
2011-02-12T12:59:00.000Z	ejv	MaslowK	questions like that aren't supported here, please ask in #ubuntu-offtoipc
2011-02-12T13:00:00.000Z	MaslowK	ejv	Sorry, more of a generic question
2011-02-12T13:34:00.000Z	ejv	MaslowK	sees you guys talking, then he feels like it's ok to chime in on the (off) topic as well
