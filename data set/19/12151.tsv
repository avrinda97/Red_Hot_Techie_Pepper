2009-10-20T15:46:00.000Z	GIR7590		Hey, I recently installed SDL via apt-get, but whenever I try to compile something, it doesn't seem to see the libraries, and it always says "error: <sdl header file> : No such file or directory" (Replacing <sdl header file> with an actual header filename obvoisly)...
2009-10-20T15:46:00.000Z	GIR7590		Any thoughts?
2009-10-20T15:47:00.000Z	GIR7590		Anyone?
2009-10-20T15:47:00.000Z	rsk	GIR7590	you need the -dev packages
2009-10-20T15:48:00.000Z	rsk	GIR7590	regular packages don't contain headers
2009-10-20T15:48:00.000Z	GIR7590		like sdl-mixer<version>-dev Right?
2009-10-20T15:48:00.000Z	rsk		maybe, not sure
2009-10-20T15:49:00.000Z	GIR7590		Hm, I think that may be my problem with some sections of SDL, but I installed the dev for mixer, and it still didn't detect it... Is there a full bundle for the -dev apckages?
2009-10-20T15:49:00.000Z	GIR7590		packages*
2009-10-20T15:53:00.000Z	GIR7590		Hey
2009-10-20T15:54:00.000Z	GIR7590		Thanks, I'll check that out.
2009-10-20T16:03:00.000Z	GIR7590		I think I found my problem, looks like there isn't just a universal repo for all versions of Ubuntu, I am currently using Hardy Heron, and it isn't updating SDL to the extent that is needed by the source I am trying to compile, does anyone know if (If possible) I could update my repos so they use a newer version of Ubuntu's repos?
2009-10-20T16:03:00.000Z	GIR7590		I would upgrade, but I really don't feel like partitioning, or restarting from scratch on this system...
2009-10-20T16:05:00.000Z	GIR7590		Any ideas anyone? :\
2009-10-20T16:06:00.000Z	GIR7590		I am trying to build a little program called EDuke32, it requires newer SDL libraries than what I currently have...
2009-10-20T16:08:00.000Z	GIR7590	Ademan	Sounds like you had fun. :o
2009-10-20T16:08:00.000Z	rsk	GIR7590	looked at? http://wiki.eduke32.com/wiki/Building_EDuke32_on_Linux
2009-10-20T16:08:00.000Z	GIR7590		Yeah.
2009-10-20T16:08:00.000Z	rsk	GIR7590	gotten in contact with upstream?
