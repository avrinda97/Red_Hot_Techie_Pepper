2011-01-15T12:55:00.000Z	sam-_-	akav	look into /etc/default/acpi-support
2011-01-15T12:56:00.000Z	akav	sam-_-	can you explain that a little further? How would looking into that solve the problem when it happens?
2011-01-15T12:56:00.000Z	akav	sam-_-	I assume this is due to a faulty driver.
2011-01-15T12:56:00.000Z	sam-_-	akav	you can select different suspend methods there.
2011-01-15T12:57:00.000Z	akav	sam-_-	how do I know which one to choose?
2011-01-15T12:57:00.000Z	sam-_-	akav	you don't unless you what's causing your problem.
2011-01-15T12:58:00.000Z	sam-_-	akav	i would try setting APCI_SLEEP_MODE  to standby
2011-01-15T13:01:00.000Z	sam-_-	akav	are you using restricted drivers. then you may want to add them to the MODULES list in the file given
2011-01-15T13:02:00.000Z	akav	sam-_-	"acpi-support" is not currently enabled in /etc/default/acpi-support. And my notebook has Intel graphics.
2011-01-15T13:02:00.000Z	akav	sam-_-	so driver support should be solid in theory
2011-01-15T13:03:00.000Z	sam-_-	akav	what do you mean it is not enabled?
2011-01-15T13:04:00.000Z	akav	sam-_-	SUSPEND_METHODS="dbus-pm dbus-hal pm-utils"
2011-01-15T13:04:00.000Z	sam-_-	akav	looks fine
2011-01-15T13:05:00.000Z	sam-_-	akav	yes. as said there: DEPRECATED
2011-01-15T13:05:00.000Z	akav	sam-_-	then it says the options below only work for the deprecated apci-support method.
2011-01-15T13:06:00.000Z	akav	sam-_-	so I take that to mean that changing ACPI_SLEEP_MODE as you suggested will have no effect.
2011-01-15T13:06:00.000Z	sam-_-	akav	oh. cheers for actually reading the thing :-)
2011-01-15T13:06:00.000Z	sam-_-	akav	suppose so
2011-01-15T13:06:00.000Z	akav	sam-_-	haha
