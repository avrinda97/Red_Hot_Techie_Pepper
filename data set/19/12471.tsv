2012-08-17T18:24:00.000Z	exarkun		Does even one of the video dvd burning applications on Ubuntu work?  I've tried all the ones I can find, k3b, brasero, devede, they're all horribly broken.
2012-08-17T18:24:00.000Z	mneptok	exarkun	i used DeVeDe 48h ago to create a DVD. it worked fine.
2012-08-17T18:25:00.000Z	exarkun	mneptok	I just spent an hour fighting with devede.  All it will do is telling me I don't have permission to write to the temporary directory.
2012-08-17T18:25:00.000Z	exarkun		(And a review of the code suggests it was written by someone extremely incompetent, so it's probably riddled with other critical bugs)
2012-08-17T18:26:00.000Z	mneptok	exarkun	what is it using as a temporary directory?
2012-08-17T18:26:00.000Z	exarkun		(Surprise, if you _delete_ the temporary directory, you won't be able to write to it!)
2012-08-17T18:26:00.000Z	exarkun	mneptok	I told it to use "/tmp/scratch", amongst various other settings.  I have write permission to it, honest.
2012-08-17T18:27:00.000Z	mneptok	exarkun	i have never seen that behavior. and i have used DeVeDe more than once.
2012-08-17T18:27:00.000Z	exarkun	mneptok	Well, that's quite fortunate for you, but it doesn't really help me.
2012-08-17T18:27:00.000Z	exarkun		Do you want to bring your laptop over to my house and burn this dvd for me?
2012-08-17T18:28:00.000Z	mneptok	exarkun	if you have found bugs, report them and fix them in your local tree.
2012-08-17T18:28:00.000Z	exarkun	mneptok	Seriously, the devede code is a trainwreck.  It's not worth fixing, it should be thrown away.
2012-08-17T18:28:00.000Z	mneptok	exarkun	i don't need a DVD. you do. you drtive.
2012-08-17T18:28:00.000Z	mneptok		*drive.
2012-08-17T18:28:00.000Z	exarkun		Along with the other useless, broken software that is, for some mysterious reason, packaged at all.
2012-08-17T18:28:00.000Z	mneptok	exarkun	so throw it away and write something better. since that's the approach you seem to want to take.
2012-08-17T18:29:00.000Z	exarkun	mneptok	You're being quite helpful.
2012-08-17T18:29:00.000Z	mneptok	exarkun	GIGO.
2012-08-17T18:29:00.000Z	exarkun	mneptok	Thanks for your recommendation.  Unfortunately devede is not going to work for me.
