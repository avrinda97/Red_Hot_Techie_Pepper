2006-03-28T14:52:00.000Z	oskude	toxic_	just some quessing, where did you get the "/etc/acpi/screenblank.sh" ? was it with ubuntu ?
2006-03-28T14:53:00.000Z	toxic_	oskude	That would be my guess yeah. Why ?
2006-03-28T14:54:00.000Z	oskude	toxic_	i was just quessing that the script is not "correct" (if you got it outside ubuntu)
2006-03-28T14:55:00.000Z	oskude	toxic_	but i remember seeing "MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1" but dunno where...
2006-03-28T14:55:00.000Z	toxic_	oskude	That would have been quite a good guess, but since kernel 2.4 something acpi is part of the linux kernel, and I haven't installed any external acpi scripts ..
2006-03-28T14:56:00.000Z	toxic_	oskude	yeah, there's alot of info about that part on google. Not with this is specific, but trying to start a program (gui) and the x server complains. It seems it's solved by su prog_name by most. But that doesn't seem to help in my case though.
2006-03-28T14:57:00.000Z	oskude	toxic_	you could try runnig that script from terminal for error hunting...
2006-03-28T14:58:00.000Z	toxic_	oskude	yeah. I get the same error though. Error: Xlib: connection to ":0.0" refused by server acpi, and magic cookie error again :S
2006-03-28T15:00:00.000Z	oskude	toxic_	i dont know more neither, (and if google didnt help) so _i_ would trial and error in that script :)
2006-03-28T15:01:00.000Z	toxic_	oskude	There's probably some good info on page 30992 on google :P Yeah, I guess I'll go for the trial and error. Just buggs me that all sugestions that I've found so far is typing "su -" before performing the cmd. Oh well, thanks anyway for your help.
2006-03-28T15:02:00.000Z	oskude	toxic_	or its just a "simple" problem with rights
2006-03-28T15:03:00.000Z	oskude	toxic_	what does "echo $DISPLAY" say ?
2006-03-28T15:03:00.000Z	toxic_	oskude	might be. But then it should work as root I guess
2006-03-28T15:04:00.000Z	oskude	toxic_	do you get the exact same error with and with out "sudo" (when running the script form terminal) ?
2006-03-28T15:04:00.000Z	toxic_	oskude	hmm .. nvm actually. That might be the problem. In regular usermode DISPLAY gives me :0.0 something, but as root it's blank :D I'll assign correct val to it and try again.
2006-03-28T15:09:00.000Z	toxic_	oskude	bash export DISPLAY=:0.0 ... Isn't that the way it's supposed to be typed ?
2006-03-28T15:10:00.000Z	oskude	toxic_	could be...
2006-03-28T15:11:00.000Z	oskude	toxic_	btw, i dont know if anyone else (even root) has permissions (by default) to communicate with your x display...
2006-03-28T15:12:00.000Z	toxic_	oskude	That seems strange to me. I'm guessing there's no chmoding to set permissions either :|
