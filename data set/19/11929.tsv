2006-02-27T16:15:00.000Z	rukuartic		What runs faster, KDE or Gnome?
2006-02-27T16:15:00.000Z	LjL	rukuartic	they're both dog slow
2006-02-27T16:15:00.000Z	rukuartic	LjL	What do you reccomend?
2006-02-27T16:15:00.000Z	LjL	rukuartic	KDE
2006-02-27T16:16:00.000Z	rukuartic	LjL	Its faster?
2006-02-27T16:16:00.000Z	LjL	rukuartic	hm no, not really... it's slow in a different way. to me, it feels like gnome is consistently slow, while kde is more temperamental :)
2006-02-27T16:16:00.000Z	LjL	rukuartic	but the reason i prefer KDE is really not speed anyway
2006-02-27T16:16:00.000Z	rukuartic	LjL	Haha I perfer temperamental over consistancy
2006-02-27T16:26:00.000Z	LjL	rukuartic	not X apps
2006-02-27T16:26:00.000Z	LjL	rukuartic	you can certainly *switch* to a console though :)
2006-02-27T16:27:00.000Z	LjL	rukuartic	well then "sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop" if you've got gnome
2006-02-27T16:32:00.000Z	rukuartic	LjL	Ah...
2006-02-27T16:27:00.000Z	LjL	rukuartic	"sudo /etc/init.d/kdm stop" if you've got kde
2006-02-27T16:32:00.000Z	LjL	rukuartic	no need to startx, you can just call the script manually... i.e. sudo /etc/init.d/gdm start
2006-02-27T16:47:00.000Z	LjL	rukuartic	neiras: what, the karma, or the runlevel pri? :)
2006-02-27T16:47:00.000Z	rukuartic	LjL	runlevels :P
2006-02-28T17:23:00.000Z	LjL	rukuartic	tried linuxprinting.org?
2006-02-28T17:23:00.000Z	rukuartic	LjL	triumphs again!!
2007-04-20T06:49:00.000Z	rukuartic	LjL	Aha, #ubuntu-effects
