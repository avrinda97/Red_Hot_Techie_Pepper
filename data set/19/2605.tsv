2010-04-06T21:48:00.000Z	calum		Does anyone here know any virtualisation software that supports windows aero for Ubuntu?
2010-04-06T21:48:00.000Z	calum		I've tried numerous things in virtualbox but it doesnt suppport it
2010-04-06T21:49:00.000Z	valari	calum	vbox with nested paging and amd-v or intel vt on will also work
2010-04-06T21:50:00.000Z	valari	calum	aero will run only if 3-d acc and intelvt or amd-v technology is activated
2010-04-06T21:51:00.000Z	calum	valari	Also virtual machines don't access the hosts graphics directly :(
2010-04-06T21:51:00.000Z	valari	calum	yes yeah too risky architecture like this i work with vmware :)
2010-04-06T21:52:00.000Z	calum	valari	I just can't stand vista or 7 without aero
2010-04-06T21:53:00.000Z	calum	valari	So It will work if I enable nested paging and amd-v in virtual box? I was also using the virtualbox guest additions driver... but I removed it
2010-04-06T21:54:00.000Z	valari	calum	go ahead try!!
2010-04-06T21:55:00.000Z	calum	valari	Umm, amd-v and nested paging are enabled, and I tried the aero transparency and glass effects before but they didn't work :(
2010-04-06T21:56:00.000Z	valari	calum	:( ...... hm..
2010-04-06T21:57:00.000Z	calum	valari	If it is any help my graphics card is an ATI Radeon Mobility HD 4200

2010-04-06T21:58:00.000Z	valari	calum	pero !!
2010-04-06T22:00:00.000Z	calum	valari	So I guess I should try vmware? I need the VM for my Uni course
2010-04-06T22:00:00.000Z	valari	calum	vmware will do.. install the xen kernal for ultimate experience
