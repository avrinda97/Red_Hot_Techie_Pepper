2009-07-08T19:46:00.000Z	axisys		!gnome
2009-07-08T19:46:00.000Z	coz_	axisys	    rm -rf .gnome .gnome2 .gconf .gconfd .metacity
2009-07-08T19:46:00.000Z	coz_	axisys	 restart x  and all should be back to default
2009-07-08T19:47:00.000Z	axisys	coz_	i think there is a better tool.. something like gnome-reset .. something.. can't find it
2009-07-08T19:47:00.000Z	coz_	axisys	 well that command should do it for you
2010-08-31T05:32:00.000Z	coz_	axisys	 you want to change the positions of the buttons ,,,the menu button I am not sure  but the other buttons are easily changed in gconf-editor
2010-08-31T05:32:00.000Z	axisys	coz_	where in gconf-editor.. i have that open
2010-08-31T05:33:00.000Z	coz_	axisys	  go to  apps/metacity/general
2010-08-31T05:33:00.000Z	coz_	axisys	 look on the right column for  "button_layout"
2010-08-31T05:33:00.000Z	axisys	coz_	found it! thanks a lot
2010-08-31T05:34:00.000Z	coz_	axisys	 if you want the buttons on the right  notice the  :  at the end  put that at the beginning  then it should look like this after editing  the words  :minimize,maximize,close
2010-08-31T05:34:00.000Z	axisys	coz_	thanks
2010-08-31T05:35:00.000Z	coz_	axisys	 no problem...the menu button on the other hand I do not believe has a gconf key for it
2010-08-31T05:36:00.000Z	axisys	coz_	i think the button_layout is what I was looking for.. probly explaining it wrong :-)
2010-08-31T05:36:00.000Z	coz_	axisys	 oh cool :)
2010-08-31T05:36:00.000Z	axisys	coz_	thanks a lot!
2010-08-31T05:36:00.000Z	coz_	axisys	 no problem
