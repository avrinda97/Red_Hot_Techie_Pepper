2010-09-03T10:16:00.000Z	etherealite	Arrick	select the recover options on boot
2010-09-03T10:17:00.000Z	Arrick	etherealite	what are the key strokes, I cant see anything on it
2010-09-03T10:17:00.000Z	etherealite	Arrick	either that or mount the drive volume and change the default run level to 1 instead of 2
2010-09-03T10:18:00.000Z	Arrick	etherealite	I dont see any of these options on the install screen

2010-09-03T10:27:00.000Z	Arrick	etherealite	there are only 4 options, and none are "Safe graphics Mode" like you used to have to do to load the OS, and then get to a shell to change xorg.conf
2010-09-03T10:29:00.000Z	etherealite	Arrick	use the console mode
2010-09-03T10:29:00.000Z	Arrick	etherealite	thats what I thought I was asking about, how do I get to it?
2010-09-03T10:31:00.000Z	etherealite	Arrick	what are all the modes listed when you press f4?
2010-09-03T10:32:00.000Z	Arrick	etherealite	I'm trying the one that said "Install a minimal virtual machine" right quick
