2009-01-15T23:50:00.000Z	neosuki		how to check whether a package has already been installed or not in ubuntu using apt-get?
2009-01-15T23:51:00.000Z	ASULutzy	neosuki	You can use apt-cache policy packageName
2009-01-15T23:57:00.000Z	ASULutzy	neosuki	Network manager makes it pretty pain free, you have to apt-get install a certain package depending on what kind of VPN it is, but after that simple
2009-01-15T23:57:00.000Z	neosuki	ASULutzy	wassy121 I've installed tightvnc client
2009-01-15T23:58:00.000Z	ASULutzy	neosuki	vnc and vpn are different?
2009-01-15T23:59:00.000Z	neosuki	ASULutzy	I need to work with vnc only
2009-01-15T23:59:00.000Z	ASULutzy	neosuki	Then why did you ask about vpn's? I'm confused :)
2009-01-15T23:59:00.000Z	neosuki	ASULutzy	Sorry for the confusion...
2009-01-16T00:00:00.000Z	neosuki	ASULutzy	i've vnc client running whereas vnc server is running at the other end. I know the server's ip address
2009-01-16T00:03:00.000Z	ASULutzy	neosuki	try sudo apt-get install tsclient, then go to applications -> internet -> terminal server client, and configuring it from there
2009-01-16T00:04:00.000Z	ASULutzy	neosuki	All VNC does is forward the display from one machine to another
2009-01-16T00:04:00.000Z	neosuki	ASULutzy	wassy121 tsclient work with vncserver also?
2009-01-16T00:05:00.000Z	ASULutzy	neosuki	Yes
2009-01-16T00:05:00.000Z	neosuki	ASULutzy	thanks dude!
2009-01-16T00:05:00.000Z	ASULutzy	neosuki	oCean_: Yes, this too, I just have some weird bias for tsclient, don't really know why :)
2009-01-16T00:06:00.000Z	ASULutzy	neosuki	I would also try what oCean_ recommended
2009-01-16T00:07:00.000Z	neosuki	ASULutzy	wht kind of server does the other end should run for me to see the desktop?
2009-01-16T00:08:00.000Z	ASULutzy	neosuki	Well, a VNC server. Alternatively, if they're running Windows, they can run remote desktop, and tsclient can be used to connect to that using RDP
2009-01-16T00:08:00.000Z	neosuki	ASULutzy	thanks! but will port# matters?
