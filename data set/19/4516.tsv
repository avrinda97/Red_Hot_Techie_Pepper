2008-12-31T11:55:00.000Z	ganu		how to estimate the operating system performance .. is there any tool to do that
2008-12-31T11:55:00.000Z	miranda_psi	ganu	performance in waht?
2008-12-31T11:55:00.000Z	ganu	miranda_psi	overall system performace
2008-12-31T11:57:00.000Z	miranda_psi	ganu	you can see how much cpu and memory s used by running top or you can use the default system monitor (also gives network usage, etc) for a basic look at the performance
2008-12-31T11:58:00.000Z	ganu	miranda_psi	what is the default sytem monitor
2008-12-31T11:58:00.000Z	miranda_psi	ganu	you can find it under System, Administration  and its in there as System Monitor
2008-12-31T11:59:00.000Z	ganu	miranda_psi	ok
2008-12-31T12:00:00.000Z	miranda_psi	ganu	the system monitor is 'gnome-system-monitor' if you need that
2008-12-31T12:00:00.000Z	ganu	miranda_psi	after using this tool .. how can i control it
2008-12-31T12:01:00.000Z	miranda_psi	ganu	what is it that you want to get out of it?
2008-12-31T12:01:00.000Z	ganu	miranda_psi	not clear
2008-12-31T12:05:00.000Z	miranda_psi	ganu	there are 4 tabs - System: just info on the computer, Resources: just shows usage of memory, cpu and network (can change update rate in preferences), File systems just shows all filesystems that are mounted and their usage, Process is a list of processes that you can configure to show different types of processes from view, and configure what info is shown in preferences and update speed and you can order the process in
2008-12-31T12:07:00.000Z	ganu	miranda_psi	ok .. i understood the tool
2008-12-31T12:07:00.000Z	miranda_psi	ganu	np
2008-12-31T12:08:00.000Z	ganu	miranda_psi	is there any tool to test the  operating system efficency
2008-12-31T12:10:00.000Z	miranda_psi	ganu	efficiency at what? there are a variety of benchmarking tools available that test different aspects of a system (you can get some from http://www.phoronix.com)
2008-12-31T12:11:00.000Z	ganu	miranda_psi	how can i say the ubuntu operating system is a best one ..
2008-12-31T12:12:00.000Z	ganu	miranda_psi	when i ask others to use the ubuntu .. they asked me this question ..
2008-12-31T12:13:00.000Z	miranda_psi	ganu	if you look at http://www.phoronix.com you will see a lot of benchmarks of linux there that test a lot of things - a recent one was the performance of java on windows vs linux (linux won :D )
