2006-03-09T10:12:00.000Z	cafuego	AscendedOne	What is he trying to sue as nickname?
2006-03-09T10:17:00.000Z	cafuego	AscendedOne	Looks like the nicks he's trying to use may be banned.
2006-03-09T10:18:00.000Z	cafuego	AscendedOne	Can he try a nick wtihout a hyphen?
2006-03-09T10:21:00.000Z	cafuego	AscendedOne	maybe his irc plugin is busted and it's appending non-ascii data on the nickname command to the server.
2006-03-09T10:21:00.000Z	cafuego	AscendedOne	Get him to use a real irc client, see if that works OK.
2006-03-09T10:22:00.000Z	cafuego	AscendedOne	Yes, but obviously not for him <heh>. Check a different client, if that works, the plugin is his problem.
2006-03-09T10:23:00.000Z	cafuego	AscendedOne	The message you pasted is not related to this channel.
2006-03-09T10:24:00.000Z	cafuego	AscendedOne	I'm talking about the 3 lines you pasted before.
2006-03-09T10:24:00.000Z	cafuego	AscendedOne	That error is caused by the irc server, it's not related to specific channels.
2006-03-09T10:25:00.000Z	cafuego	AscendedOne	Step one on the way to solving it would be to try a different client and see what happens.
