2008-02-21T23:58:00.000Z	Yegar		does it matter that it says "firmware=n/a" in the reponce from sudo -C network?
2008-02-22T00:00:00.000Z	Yegar		what is the trick to enabling a wired network card?
2008-02-22T00:01:00.000Z	ewook	Yegar	is it detected and installed?
2008-02-22T00:01:00.000Z	ewook	Yegar	ifconfig eth[nr] up
2008-02-22T00:02:00.000Z	Yegar	ewook	still no lights
2008-02-22T00:03:00.000Z	ewook	Yegar	and you did of course do a sudo with it? do you have a gui?
2008-02-22T00:03:00.000Z	ewook	Yegar	isn't  there a nice program in the gui to control the nics?
2008-02-22T00:04:00.000Z	ewook	Yegar	 uhm, okay..
2008-02-22T00:05:00.000Z	ewook	Yegar	well, I'm lost =/
2008-02-22T00:05:00.000Z	ewook	Yegar	if you had a working link before, that really shouldn't matter
2008-02-22T00:07:00.000Z	ewook	Yegar	I'd say that your nic isn't correctly installed anyway..
2008-02-22T00:08:00.000Z	Yegar	ewook	thats what I'm trying to determine, but I guess I don't know the right place to look
2008-02-22T00:08:00.000Z	ewook	Yegar	start with IRQ
2008-02-22T00:09:00.000Z	Yegar	ewook	where can I see IRQ conflicts?
2008-02-22T00:10:00.000Z	ewook	Yegar	ifconfig eth[nr] gives you the right stuff
2008-02-22T00:11:00.000Z	Yegar	ewook	it is on IRQ 17
2008-02-22T00:11:00.000Z	ewook	Yegar	I'd say, check in windows and look if that's the same
2008-02-22T00:11:00.000Z	ewook	Yegar	and doublecheck it's the right drivers.
2008-02-22T00:14:00.000Z	ewook	Yegar	is it a 'normal' nic? search for issues with the card .. don't know much else to say =/
