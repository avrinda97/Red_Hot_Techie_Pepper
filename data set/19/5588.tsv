2008-09-21T15:21:00.000Z	JuzzyD		Im using Hardy, maybe thats my issue
2008-09-21T15:21:00.000Z	JuzzyD		For instance, I've been transferring an 800mb file to USB for the last 25 minutes
2008-09-21T15:21:00.000Z	JuzzyD		Im almost 3/4 of the way there. People expect USB to just work
2008-09-21T15:22:00.000Z	JuzzyD		25 minutes
2008-09-21T15:22:00.000Z	JuzzyD		329 k/sec
2008-09-21T15:22:00.000Z	JuzzyD		But Im not an exception with Windows XP, you see where that is going?
2008-09-21T15:23:00.000Z	JuzzyD		It's better than my stints with Linux 5 years ago, come ahead in leaps and bounds
2008-09-21T15:23:00.000Z	JuzzyD		Im just saying I don't think that ma and pa users are quite ready to swap over
2008-09-21T15:24:00.000Z	JuzzyD		Agreed
2008-09-21T15:24:00.000Z	airtonix	JuzzyD	on the contrary...if ma and pa bought a pc in the shop with ubuntu presinstalled they wouldnt care....
2008-09-21T15:24:00.000Z	airtonix	JuzzyD	its the power users who 'think' they know how their machine works with windows are the ones who will never switch
2008-09-21T15:25:00.000Z	airtonix	JuzzyD	the windows power user is one who know the steps (clicks) required to get X working but understands nothing of the process involved....windows is for diagram driven intruction manuals
2008-09-21T15:27:00.000Z	airtonix	JuzzyD	dont use pulse..
2008-09-21T15:27:00.000Z	airtonix	JuzzyD	i have set my multimedia system selector to alsa...and i use aoss on progs that seem to hog the soundserver..
2008-09-21T15:29:00.000Z	airtonix	JuzzyD	for the record i havent removed pulse audio
2008-09-21T15:29:00.000Z	airtonix	JuzzyD	i merely used 'multimedia system selector' to use alsa instead.
2008-09-21T15:31:00.000Z	JuzzyD	airtonix	I've never bought a machine with Windows installed on it
2008-09-21T15:31:00.000Z	airtonix	JuzzyD	neither have i...
