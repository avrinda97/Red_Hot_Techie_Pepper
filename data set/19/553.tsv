2011-12-29T04:59:00.000Z	Melissa		i want to run W7 for an online game I have and run Ubuntu for evertythiung else.  Whatrs best way to install?  W7 first or install Ubuntu first?  and can I run W732bit and Ubuntu 64bit on the same laptop?
2011-12-29T05:00:00.000Z	LogicallyDashing	Melissa	usually you have to install Windows first or else it clobbers the bootloader. And there's no reason not to run the different arch versions.
2011-12-29T05:00:00.000Z	Melissa	LogicallyDashing	whats arch version?
2011-12-29T05:00:00.000Z	LogicallyDashing	Melissa	architecture versions of operating systems. x86 x64
2011-12-29T05:01:00.000Z	Melissa	LogicallyDashing	but I want to run ubuntu 64 bit.. but my W7 is 32 bit.. Can I dual boot them?
2011-12-29T05:01:00.000Z	LogicallyDashing	Melissa	if you use the alternate install disc you can set up an encrypted volume
2011-12-29T05:01:00.000Z	LogicallyDashing	Melissa	yes, certainly
2011-12-29T05:05:00.000Z	Melissa	LogicallyDashing	if I dont grab the alternative CD, then someone can get my data on Ubuntu?
2011-12-29T05:07:00.000Z	LogicallyDashing	Melissa	Ubuntu doesn't know or care about drive letters. You'll need to make a new *partition* by shrinking the Windows one.
2011-12-29T05:07:00.000Z	LogicallyDashing	Melissa	you can still do that but it will overwrite ubuntu.
2011-12-29T05:11:00.000Z	LogicallyDashing	Melissa	you should probably start referring to those drives by their numbers instead
2011-12-29T05:12:00.000Z	LogicallyDashing	Melissa	the letters are a Windows specific thing
2011-12-29T05:12:00.000Z	Melissa	LogicallyDashing	i dont know what the letters are for C: and D: and E: etc?
2011-12-29T05:12:00.000Z	LogicallyDashing	Melissa	the numbers are usually 1 for recovery and 2 for Windows
2011-12-29T05:13:00.000Z	LogicallyDashing	Melissa	depending on how you partition, Ubuntu will be on partition 3 or 5
2011-12-29T05:13:00.000Z	Melissa	LogicallyDashing	so C: = sda1?  And D: = sda2? e: = sda3
2011-12-29T05:13:00.000Z	Melissa	LogicallyDashing	eh? :P
2011-12-29T05:13:00.000Z	LogicallyDashing	Melissa	it *really* depends on the order that the partitions appear on the disk, so all I can say is "probably"
2011-12-29T05:14:00.000Z	LogicallyDashing	Melissa	think of partitions as really enormous files. they are in a particular order. so we give them numbers.
