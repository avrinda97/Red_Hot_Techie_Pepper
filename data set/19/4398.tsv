2009-01-24T09:47:00.000Z	puff		I think /dev/hdc is the old ubuntu install, it appears to be an LVM parittion.
2009-01-24T09:47:00.000Z	puff		Do I need to do osmething funky to mount it?
2009-01-24T09:47:00.000Z	carl-m	puff	what problem are you having with it?
2009-01-24T09:48:00.000Z	puff	carl-m	Well, given the paste, what -t arg do I use with mount?
2009-01-24T09:50:00.000Z	carl-m	puff	you can just guess a type, or use file -s /dev/hdc1

2009-01-24T09:50:00.000Z	carl-m	puff	you need to mount /dev/hdc1
2009-01-24T09:51:00.000Z	carl-m	puff	or /dev/hdc3
2009-01-24T09:51:00.000Z	puff	carl-m	Ah, cool, that owrked.
2009-01-24T09:54:00.000Z	puff	carl-m	Okay, so /dev/hdc1 mounts ifne as ext3, but that's grub, vm, etc.  hdec2 is the boot partition so that doesn't buy me much.  sudo file -s /dev/hdc5 gets me: /dev/hdc5: LVM2 (Linux Logical Volume Manager) , UUID: r2qPJg6voPhTQpF5MiN2ZUvEHUiI4AV
2009-01-24T09:55:00.000Z	puff	carl-m	So... how do I mount that?
2009-01-24T09:56:00.000Z	puff	carl-m	I guess more importantly, what are the odds I'll be able to mount that on this machien (centos 5.2)?
2009-01-24T09:58:00.000Z	carl-m	puff	 I never used lvm, look at http://www.brandonhutchinson.com/Mounting_a_Linux_LVM_volume.html
2009-01-24T10:01:00.000Z	puff	carl-m	I can't get past the second command in there, it says "mount /dev/hda /tmp/mnt" and doesn't specify a -t, when I leave out -t mount comiplains.

2009-01-24T10:02:00.000Z	carl-m	puff	apparently you need to use the commands 'pvs' and 'lvdisplay' to see the names of the volumes
2009-01-24T10:04:00.000Z	puff	carl-m	Mucho thanks for your help.
