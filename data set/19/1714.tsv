2010-10-23T05:43:00.000Z	dli	tuyetmy	or you mean exif viewer? I think shotwell(gnome) can view exif, try others also, gimp, gpicview, gqview
2010-10-23T05:45:00.000Z	dli	tuyetmy	if you know when the image was generated originally, then, exif records the modification time as well.
2010-10-23T05:45:00.000Z	tuyetmy	dli	ah, I understand
2010-10-23T05:46:00.000Z	tuyetmy	dli	how about gimp , inkscape, will they show that information ?
2010-10-23T05:46:00.000Z	dli	tuyetmy	but if the student knows about exif, he/she probably can modify it to fake the origin as well
2010-10-23T05:47:00.000Z	tuyetmy	dli	is exif more special than gimp or inkscape ?
2010-10-23T05:47:00.000Z	dli	tuyetmy	exif is quite old, so I suppose many software support it, but I have no experience myself
2010-10-23T05:47:00.000Z	dli	tuyetmy	no, exif is part of image file format
2010-10-23T05:51:00.000Z	dli	tuyetmy	yes, just check shotwell and gqview shows exif info
2010-10-23T05:52:00.000Z	tuyetmy	dli	how to view exif info in dqview ?
2010-10-23T05:53:00.000Z	dli	tuyetmy	gqview, choose View->Exif WIndow, it generates more numbers, to get it more human readable try: shotwell View->Exif Info
2010-10-23T05:58:00.000Z	tuyetmy	dli	shotwell : view => fullScreen ; just has that option
2010-10-23T05:58:00.000Z	dli	tuyetmy	have you imported your photos first in shotwell?
2010-10-23T05:59:00.000Z	tuyetmy	dli	it's in jpg
2010-10-23T05:59:00.000Z	dli	tuyetmy	then, click a photo first, and click 'View' -> 'Extended Information'
2010-10-23T06:00:00.000Z	tuyetmy	dli	there is no "modify" information
2010-10-23T06:02:00.000Z	dli	tuyetmy	I think shotwell arranges photos by date :) and display photo time at the left bottom corner
2010-10-23T06:03:00.000Z	dli	tuyetmy	if you see the modified time be later, it's a clear sign of manipulation, however, the time can be easily reset to whatever, if the user knows exif
2010-10-23T06:10:00.000Z	dli	tuyetmy	try this one: sudo apt-get install mapivi , I think it's enough for forensic purposes
