2009-01-09T01:08:00.000Z	omnydevi	hudnix	try ntfs3g /dev/sda1/ /mnt/what_ever_name_here
2009-01-09T01:08:00.000Z	hudnix		or that :)
2009-01-09T01:08:00.000Z	omnydevi	hudnix	my bad, i thought you were asking a question mate. i just got back from lunch, heh
2009-01-09T01:10:00.000Z	hudnix	omnydevi	hehe. since we're on the subject, do you know of an oss ntfs fsck/file recovery type utility?
2009-01-09T01:11:00.000Z	omnydevi	hudnix	not off the top of my head. i just use the system rescue cd to try and recover data off of client machines with rsync. is it a windows box or just ntfs partition?
2009-01-09T01:11:00.000Z	omnydevi		i am sure i could find one
2009-01-09T01:11:00.000Z	omnydevi		i think gparted comes with a checker/fixer thing
2009-01-09T01:13:00.000Z	hudnix	omnydevi	I have to repair dead windows systems with corrupt/dying disks from time to time. Would be nice to just be able to plug the disks into my ubuntu box and have it take it from there since that's my gerneral-purpose data recovery machine anyway. having to run windows recovery first is just a pain.
2009-01-09T01:14:00.000Z	omnydevi	hudnix	amen to that, sounds like we do some of the same stuff. normally i just use a usb drive though, we have had to fix them in the past, just forget exactly how we did it. been a while
2009-01-09T01:15:00.000Z	omnydevi	hudnix	generally we just copy the my documents and format and then reinstall. usually virus infected systems we get :/
2009-01-09T01:16:00.000Z	hudnix	omnydevi	Yeah, we do the same stuff :)
2009-01-09T01:16:00.000Z	omnydevi	hudnix	wonder if you could test a oooo!! i can test in my vm i bet
2009-01-09T01:17:00.000Z	omnydevi		that would be awesome to play with
2009-01-09T01:17:00.000Z	hudnix	omnydevi	an oooo?
2009-01-09T01:18:00.000Z	omnydevi	hudnix	just got the idea to break an XP vm i have and see what it does booting from my rescuecd, i am sure it has some kinda partion fixer in it
2009-01-09T01:20:00.000Z	hudnix	omnydevi	sounds interesting. Ever tried taking a windows disk and booting it inside a VM?
2009-01-09T01:22:00.000Z	omnydevi	hudnix	roger. i run vmware workstation 6.5 on my desktop at home. i have ubuntu as my host, and a windows 7 vm and xp vm. i will just snapshot my xp vm then break the hell out of it and see what all system rescue cd can do to fix it
2009-01-09T01:23:00.000Z	hudnix	omnydevi	let me know how it goes :). I have to run now.
2009-01-09T01:24:00.000Z	omnydevi	hudnix	will do man, take care!
