2008-05-14T00:08:00.000Z	InvisiblePinkUni	Jburrke	Use synaptic and install.
2008-05-14T00:08:00.000Z	InvisiblePinkUni	Jburrke	If in doubt use synaptic package manager.
2008-05-14T00:08:00.000Z	Jburrke	InvisiblePinkUni	synaptic = the add/remove thing under applications? Oo
2008-05-14T00:09:00.000Z	InvisiblePinkUni	Jburrke	System->Administration->Synaptic
2008-05-14T00:09:00.000Z	Jburrke	InvisiblePinkUni	what's the difference between this and the add/remove thing?
2008-05-14T00:10:00.000Z	InvisiblePinkUni	Jburrke	I think they are related, Both of them use apt, but Add/Remove is supposed to be Friendlier to use for Windoze users.
2008-05-14T00:11:00.000Z	Jburrke	InvisiblePinkUni	lmfao windoze.. synaptic is confusing.. there are so many things here
2008-05-14T00:12:00.000Z	InvisiblePinkUni	Jburrke	:-)
2008-05-14T00:12:00.000Z	InvisiblePinkUni	Jburrke	Synaptic is the best in my opinion.
2008-05-14T00:12:00.000Z	InvisiblePinkUni	Jburrke	I don't use it much, but its very easy to use.
2008-05-14T00:12:00.000Z	Jburrke	InvisiblePinkUni	lol, but i have no idea what to do from here XD.. there are so many results under bittorrent ><
2008-05-14T00:12:00.000Z	InvisiblePinkUni	Jburrke	I use apt-get a lot.
2008-05-14T00:13:00.000Z	InvisiblePinkUni	Jburrke	Just click on the one you like and install.
2008-05-14T00:13:00.000Z	Jburrke	InvisiblePinkUni	okay ><
