2008-05-07T16:33:00.000Z	Outlander		I've set the root password on my newly installed Ubuntu 8.04 system. It appears to have altered the sudo system so that I cannot run Synaptic from the menu. What would definitive answer be for this?
2008-05-07T16:34:00.000Z	zcat[1]	Outlander	It shouldn't have made any difference at all. How did you set it?
2008-05-07T16:34:00.000Z	zcat[1]	Outlander	and also 'why'?!
2008-05-07T16:36:00.000Z	zcat[1]	Outlander	I'm not sure you've done what you think you've done at all..
2008-05-07T16:41:00.000Z	zcat[1]	Outlander	well, that should not have caused the problem... although I still would not recommend setting a root password unless you have a very specific idea of why you need it (and if you know what you're doing, you'll see that even then you actually don't need it!)
2008-05-07T16:42:00.000Z	zcat[1]	Outlander	alias su="sudo -i" ;)
2008-05-07T16:43:00.000Z	zcat[1]	Outlander	setting the root password should not have caused your problem though. You must have done something more than just setting the root password
2008-05-07T16:44:00.000Z	Outlander	zcat[1]	finally, progress...ok well other stuff ive done are: install the infernal citrix client and uninstall it and install it again
2008-05-07T16:48:00.000Z	Outlander	zcat[1]	so you mentioned that doing sudo passwd should not cause this issue: "ï»¿Unable to copy the user's Xauthorization file" ?
2008-05-07T16:49:00.000Z	zcat[1]	Outlander	yes. Just setting a root password should not cause that. I don't know what does.
2008-05-07T16:52:00.000Z	zcat[1]	Outlander	so the problem is gksu picking up your Xauthority ... I suspect just logging out and back in might be enough to fix it
2008-05-07T16:54:00.000Z	Outlander	zcat[1]	so setting root's password would cause this issue then? as it could have tinkered with sudo related config files?
2008-05-07T16:54:00.000Z	zcat[1]	Outlander	I'm lazy.. I never really understood how Xauthority works. But I think it generates tokens when you first log in.. logging out and back in should regerate them
2008-05-07T16:55:00.000Z	zcat[1]	Outlander	Not sure how they'd have got messed up. I'm sure just setting a root password wouldn't do it.
2008-05-07T16:56:00.000Z	zcat[1]	Outlander	well, that might help. I never bothered figuring it out too much. I know how to turn all the xauth off so I can launch windows from anywhere without having to use ssh -X :)
2008-05-07T17:09:00.000Z	zcat[1]	Outlander	sot sudo?
2008-05-07T17:10:00.000Z	zcat[1]	Outlander	ahhh.. that would be a problem :)
2008-05-07T17:12:00.000Z	zcat[1]	Outlander	that would probably explain the gksu problem too.. likely it tries to make tmp files
2008-05-07T17:26:00.000Z	Outlander	zcat[1]	does this solution look ok? http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=4901962#post4901962
