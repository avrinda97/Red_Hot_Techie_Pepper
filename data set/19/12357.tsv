2007-05-18T05:37:00.000Z	ryan__		I have ubuntu desktop edition. 7.04 installed already.. I dont have a copy of the server but can download it.. Is there any reason for me to switch, or is all the server stuff easily installable through apt-get? I'm trying to setup a webserver testbed.
2007-05-18T05:37:00.000Z	Flannel	ryan__	The server vs desktop is only different in the packages installed by default
2007-05-18T05:37:00.000Z	Flannel	ryan__	you can convert one to the other and v.v. easily, and have components of both installed easily and stuff.
2007-05-18T05:38:00.000Z	Flannel	ryan__	they're really all just "ubuntu", and then you install whatever you want on them.
2007-05-18T05:38:00.000Z	Flannel	ryan__	that page (the url) gets you up to speed with LAMP
2007-06-23T13:03:00.000Z	Flannel	ryan__	programs don't really have folders.  The different components are spread out in different parts of the filesystem.
2007-06-23T13:04:00.000Z	Flannel	ryan__	it's somewhere in your home folder, guaranteed.
2010-05-16T05:21:00.000Z	Flannel	ryan__	Please mind your language
2010-05-16T05:21:00.000Z	ryan__	Flannel	Pf.
2010-05-16T05:23:00.000Z	Flannel	ryan__	No, he didn't hide it, but him being rude and obnoxious doesn't give you the right to use foul language
2010-05-16T05:24:00.000Z	ryan__	Flannel	he used it why shouldn't I.
2010-05-16T05:24:00.000Z	Flannel	ryan__	Now, back to your issue.  Have you tried asking in #winehq? (I certainly don't know enough about steam or wine to diagnose)
2010-05-16T05:24:00.000Z	ryan__	Flannel	nope, but I 'll certainly have a look in there, thanks.
2010-08-22T07:40:00.000Z	Flannel	ryan__	What version of Ubuntu are you using?
2010-08-22T07:40:00.000Z	ryan__	Flannel	10.04
2010-08-22T07:43:00.000Z	Flannel	ryan__	10.04 has 1.2 in the official Ubuntu repositories.  You must have the winehq repositories (or some other third party repository) enabled.  Remove wine (and anything else that says *wine* in the package name), disable whatever repository it came from (`apt-cache policy wine` before you remove it will help you figure out where it came from) and then apt-get update, and install wine.
2010-08-22T07:44:00.000Z	ryan__	Flannel	My bad, I hadn't the brain the check my Wine version. Apparently I have version 1.1.42, through using the wine --version command.
2010-08-22T07:45:00.000Z	ryan__	Flannel	If I only want to update to version 1.3, what should I type?
2010-08-22T07:46:00.000Z	Flannel	ryan__	Oh, that's a development version.  http://www.winehq.org/download/deb  Will tell you how to install it from a PPA (and there is wine1.3 in that PPA, apparently)
