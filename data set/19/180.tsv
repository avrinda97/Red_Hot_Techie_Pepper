2012-08-11T01:27:00.000Z	W4sp	arrrghhh	This sounds as if yu do not have a desktop environment but your WM is up. Try to log in and select a different DE.
2012-08-11T01:27:00.000Z	arrrghhh	W4sp	that will probably work... but how can i fix gnome-panel?
2012-08-11T01:29:00.000Z	W4sp	arrrghhh	Re-install the the related packages. There are meta packages that will give you everything. Requires some patience during download and installation but it usually fixes it.
2012-08-11T01:33:00.000Z	arrrghhh	W4sp	can you tell me which ones?  i did a purge on gnome-panel and then installed it again.  no dice.
2012-08-11T01:34:00.000Z	W4sp	arrrghhh	I can't guide you through everything but if your lightdm comes up your previous session (before update) may be flawed. 1. Create a new user and see if that one has the same problems.
2012-08-11T01:36:00.000Z	W4sp	arrrghhh	2. Check if your ~/.dmrc has a session entry that is valid.
2012-08-11T01:39:00.000Z	arrrghhh	W4sp	so 'Unity' works.  but is it possible to fix gnome-fallback?
2012-08-11T01:40:00.000Z	W4sp	arrrghhh	Would it be fair to ask what you have done, I gave you some advice and don't know what you've tried.
2012-08-11T01:40:00.000Z	arrrghhh	W4sp	apologies.  i'm not sure what you mean by a 'valid session entry'
2012-08-11T01:40:00.000Z	arrrghhh	W4sp	i haven't tried much.  Unity works.  It sounds like Gnome Classic (No Effects) works
2012-08-11T01:41:00.000Z	W4sp	arrrghhh	I'm lost, you said it works for Unity. Did you install a new user?
2012-08-11T01:42:00.000Z	W4sp	arrrghhh	Did you use a different profile in a new session.
2012-08-11T01:43:00.000Z	arrrghhh	W4sp	no new user.  just works logging into Unity or Gnome Classic (no effects)
2012-08-11T01:45:00.000Z	W4sp	arrrghhh	Teh odd thing is that .dmrc is (or has been) ignored by GNOME.
2012-08-11T01:48:00.000Z	arrrghhh	W4sp	no worries i think he'll just use gnome classic (no effects)
2012-08-11T01:49:00.000Z	W4sp	arrrghhh	np.
2012-08-11T02:25:00.000Z	W4sp	arrrghhh	Exactly, now we're talking.
2012-08-11T02:24:00.000Z	W4sp	arrrghhh	Yeah, but exclude .3 on your router.
2012-08-11T02:24:00.000Z	arrrghhh	W4sp	or just make a dhcp range above .100.  that's what *most* do from the factory it seems.
