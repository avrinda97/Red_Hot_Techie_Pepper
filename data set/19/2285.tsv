2012-06-07T11:36:00.000Z	Jon--	fasta	Custom paths? You want to block based on a proc name?
2012-06-07T11:36:00.000Z	fasta	Jon--	no, based on a path.
2012-06-07T11:37:00.000Z	fasta	Jon--	so, /foo/bar/baz is started, and then everything coming out of port 10230 for that program should be blocked.
2012-06-07T11:37:00.000Z	fasta	Jon--	a path has had the same meaning since at least 20 years.
2012-06-07T11:38:00.000Z	Jon--	fasta	Fix your problem yourself then smartass.
2012-06-07T11:38:00.000Z	fasta	Jon--	you are the one asking stupid questions.
2012-06-07T11:38:00.000Z	Jon--	fasta	I am the second person you have disrespected as they try to help you. You're clearly too arrogant for me to bother. Figure it out.
2012-06-07T11:39:00.000Z	fasta	Jon--	ignorant person, but yes.
2012-06-07T11:41:00.000Z	Jon--	fasta	iptables has a --pid-owner. Use that.
2012-06-07T11:41:00.000Z	fasta	Jon--	that's not what I originally asked.
2012-06-07T11:42:00.000Z	fasta	Jon--	no, I am not trolling. You are spinning around the question.
2012-06-07T11:43:00.000Z	fasta	Jon--	it has a very definite answer. So far, Windows Firewall has been superior to any GUI tool presented to you from Ubuntu.
2012-06-07T11:43:00.000Z	Jon--	fasta	Key words are "GUI tool". If you want GUI tools for networking tools and firewalling, go back to Windows.
2012-06-07T11:45:00.000Z	fasta	Jon--	I said that gufw has no such option.
2012-06-07T11:46:00.000Z	fasta	Jon--	perhaps ufw does, but it still doesn't change the original statement.
2012-06-07T11:46:00.000Z	Jon--	fasta	1) enter #ubuntu 2) call people idiots for asking questions to clarify your question (by the way, referring to anything in the Unix world by its path, and then mocking us when we ask what you mean, does make you the idiot. It's all based on the proc id on Unix systems). 3) Continue to be arrogant to those trying to help you.  Yep, us free tech support guys are really going to be motivated to look into that problem fo
2012-06-07T11:47:00.000Z	fasta	Jon--	not really; anyone with the slightest intelligence would understand. Now, just accept that someone crushed your ego and live on.
2012-06-07T11:51:00.000Z	fasta	Jon--	do you even know what a PID is?
2012-06-07T11:52:00.000Z	fasta	Jon--	no, not the best solution. Please, just go idling or something.
