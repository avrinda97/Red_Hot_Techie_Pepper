2008-08-02T00:04:00.000Z	dmitrig01		I burned a live CD
2008-08-02T00:04:00.000Z	dmitrig01		Now I stuck it in my windows box
2008-08-02T00:04:00.000Z	dmitrig01		I don't know how to boot from it though
2008-08-02T00:05:00.000Z	atlef	dmitrig01	have you set your bios to boot from cd-rom
2008-08-02T00:05:00.000Z	dmitrig01	atlef	how do I do that?
2008-08-02T00:06:00.000Z	atlef	dmitrig01	enter your bios settings and set it up
2008-08-02T00:57:00.000Z	dmitrig01	atlef	how?

2008-08-02T01:00:00.000Z	atlef	dmitrig01	well, enter your bios and setup which device your computer should boot from
2008-08-02T01:02:00.000Z	dmitrig01	atlef	I can enter the bios, and I can set it to boot from the cd drive but that doesn't work
2008-08-02T01:02:00.000Z	atlef	dmitrig01	exactly what does not work?
2008-08-02T01:03:00.000Z	dmitrig01	atlef	It boots from the hard drive
2008-08-02T01:03:00.000Z	dmitrig01	atlef	I set the CD drive to be first
2008-08-02T01:03:00.000Z	dmitrig01	atlef	actually, I might ahve burned a DVD
