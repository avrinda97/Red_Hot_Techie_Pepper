2005-04-20T10:03:00.000Z	Dreamer32	crimsun	tried all different apic, pci=noacpi, etc... to no avail
2005-04-20T10:03:00.000Z	Dreamer32	crimsun	my video card to return to console
2005-04-20T10:03:00.000Z	Dreamer32	crimsun	it works with the NV driver, but not nvidia's binary
2005-04-20T10:03:00.000Z	crimsun	Dreamer32	did you post as much to nvnews.net?
2005-04-20T10:04:00.000Z	Dreamer32	crimsun	no, is that a good resource?
2005-04-20T10:04:00.000Z	crimsun	Dreamer32	and send a bug report to nvidia?
2005-04-20T10:05:00.000Z	Dreamer32	crimsun	nope, never hard of nvnews.net, and not sure the best way to send a bug-report, maybe it's mentioned in one of those text files :)
2005-04-20T10:05:00.000Z	crimsun	Dreamer32	it is. linux-bugs@
2005-04-20T10:06:00.000Z	Dreamer32	crimsun	i've been running apps from my laptop on my desktop using X over SSH tunnels, pretty sweet stuff....
2005-04-20T10:07:00.000Z	Dreamer32	crimsun	is it nvidia.com?
2005-04-20T10:13:00.000Z	Dreamer32	crimsun	i sent a bug report
2005-04-20T10:13:00.000Z	crimsun	Dreamer32	excellent.
2005-04-20T10:13:00.000Z	Dreamer32	crimsun	i asked if they had any suggestions, should i expect a personal reply you think, or it'll just b efiled and cataloged? :)
2005-04-20T10:14:00.000Z	Dreamer32	crimsun	you don't have any idea why sometimes my laptop would realize it's been reattached to power and other times it would not do you?  it continue to "think" (ie, spin down HD, etc) it's on battery until I run /etc/acpi/power.sh by hand, at which point it resolves things
2005-04-20T10:15:00.000Z	crimsun	Dreamer32	they will contact you if they require additional info. Don't expect a personal reply otherwise.
2005-04-20T10:15:00.000Z	Dreamer32	crimsun	ah
2005-04-20T10:15:00.000Z	Dreamer32	crimsun	so it's not "support" :)
