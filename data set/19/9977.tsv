2008-03-04T20:57:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	grmbl	Did you ever run a script called automatix or envy?

2008-03-04T20:58:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	grmbl	try this..  apt-get install pastebinit
2008-03-04T20:59:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	grmbl	then  cat /etc/apt/sources.list | pastebinit and it gives you the web address   and give us the address of the pastebin...
2008-03-04T20:59:00.000Z	grmbl	Jack_Sparrow	the source list is a local mirror
2008-03-04T21:00:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	grmbl	So that should answer your question...

2008-03-04T21:03:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	grmbl	You have main repo rem'd out?
2008-03-04T21:04:00.000Z	grmbl	Jack_Sparrow	eh? on the apt-cacher? i dont know to be honest
2008-03-04T21:05:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	grmbl	the sources list you posted, has the MAIN repo disabled.
2008-03-04T21:06:00.000Z	grmbl	Jack_Sparrow	but only the commercial, or not?
2008-03-04T21:07:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	grmbl	you only have multiverse and universe enabled.
2008-03-04T21:07:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	grmbl	I gotta run.. bbl
