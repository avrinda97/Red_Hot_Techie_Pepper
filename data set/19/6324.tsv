2008-03-01T02:40:00.000Z	_Oz_		should it take me 15 minutes to copy a 2.5gb file from one computer to another on a wired 100mbit network?
2008-03-01T02:41:00.000Z	fx|RabBit	_Oz_	definitely
2008-03-01T02:41:00.000Z	_Oz_	fx|RabBit	so that's not too long? my network's not "slow"?
2008-03-01T02:42:00.000Z	fx|RabBit	_Oz_	it is a bit slow but not out of the normal
2008-03-01T02:42:00.000Z	fx|RabBit	_Oz_	whats the infrastructure of your network?
2008-03-01T02:42:00.000Z	_Oz_	fx|RabBit	is there a new higher-speed protocol in the works? if I wanted a "fast" network, how would I get one?
2008-03-01T02:42:00.000Z	_Oz_	fx|RabBit	a few PCs...  netgear router...  cable modem
2008-03-01T02:43:00.000Z	fx|RabBit	_Oz_	clearly the netgear router its not built for that
2008-03-01T02:43:00.000Z	_Oz_	fx|RabBit	how's that?
2008-03-01T02:43:00.000Z	_Oz_	fx|RabBit	it's a wireless + wired network router
2008-03-01T02:43:00.000Z	fx|RabBit	_Oz_	if you want to speed up you net a switch and of course gigabit lan dies a great job...
2008-03-01T02:43:00.000Z	fx|RabBit	_Oz_	router!=switch
2008-03-01T02:44:00.000Z	_Oz_	fx|RabBit	what does the switch do for me?
2008-03-01T02:44:00.000Z	fx|RabBit	_Oz_	well its an educated, yes
2008-03-01T02:44:00.000Z	_Oz_	fx|RabBit	what's the difference between a router and a switch?
2008-03-01T02:44:00.000Z	fx|RabBit	_Oz_	basically a switch is used to connect a network internally
2008-03-01T02:45:00.000Z	fx|RabBit	_Oz_	as a difference to a router that is used to route to the outworld as the name mimplies
2008-03-01T02:45:00.000Z	_Oz_	fx|RabBit	so what would I buy and how would I deploy it in my home network?  I have 4 desktops PCs and 2 laptops (wireless)
2008-03-01T02:46:00.000Z	fx|RabBit	_Oz_	best switchhub if cou can afford:)
