2009-01-14T21:21:00.000Z	archman_		guys it says 'Qt... configure: error: Qt (>= Qt 3.2) (library qt-mt) not found' when i try to ./configure kiso; and i checked out for it and i have limqt-mt 333
2009-01-14T21:22:00.000Z	Pici	archman_	Why are you compiling it from source?
2009-01-14T21:23:00.000Z	archman_	Pici	because it requires to update pidgin-data in synaptic...and i dont want to mess pidgin...
2009-01-14T21:24:00.000Z	Pici	archman_	I don't see anything in the kiso dependencies that looks like pidgin
2009-01-14T21:25:00.000Z	archman_	Pici	i try to install it and it says i need to update pidgin-data and libpurple0...nonsense; but i will try; btw: is kiso as good as daemon t00ls?
2009-01-14T21:26:00.000Z	archman_	Pici	btw: i'm on gnome...maybe thats why he asks for that...
2009-01-14T21:26:00.000Z	Pici	archman_	Why not use gisomount if you're using gnome?
2009-01-14T21:27:00.000Z	archman_	Pici	it support just iso mounting, i need complete support
2009-01-14T21:27:00.000Z	Pici	archman_	The kiso description doesn't say that it mounts images at all.
2009-01-14T21:28:00.000Z	archman_	Pici	???
2009-01-14T21:28:00.000Z	archman_	Pici	oh ok, i see LOL
2009-01-14T21:31:00.000Z	archman_	Pici	mount to fuse or to loop. what does it mean?
2009-01-15T00:58:00.000Z	Pici	archman_	ubuntuuser101: http://packages.ubuntu.com is the proper site
2009-01-15T00:58:00.000Z	archman_	Pici	yeah, that's it ;)
2009-01-15T01:02:00.000Z	archman_	Pici	he need gtk 2.14
2009-01-15T01:03:00.000Z	Pici	archman_	No need for the language, 2.14 is the current gtk version in Intrepid
2009-01-15T01:03:00.000Z	archman_	Pici	wtf?? isn't hardy LTS? i hate those release dates!
2009-01-15T01:04:00.000Z	Pici	archman_	LTS does not mean new versions. see above.
2009-01-20T01:31:00.000Z	archman_	Pici	thanks!
