2007-07-25T11:40:00.000Z	RickH		PS?
2007-07-25T11:40:00.000Z	RickH		"kill -9, no more cpu time"
2007-07-25T11:42:00.000Z	RickH		Anyone know why flash sometimes messes up in other tabs when browsing in Netscape or Opera?
2007-07-25T11:43:00.000Z	RickH		I'll have YouTube playing, for example, and then navigate through other sites in other tabs.  Sometimes the YouTube page goes gray and has to be restarted
2007-07-25T11:43:00.000Z	RickH		Firefox I mean.  Man, I'm tired. :(
2007-07-25T11:44:00.000Z	RickH		Automatix can solve several problems.
2007-07-25T11:44:00.000Z	RickH		What does it break?  I haven't seen it break anything.
2007-07-25T11:44:00.000Z	RickH		I've only used it maybe five times.
2007-07-25T11:45:00.000Z	RickH		The biggest problem I've seen so far is running out of disk space.
2007-07-25T11:45:00.000Z	RickH		That's what messes up your system. :)

2007-07-25T11:45:00.000Z	RickH	ilovejesus	 perhaps.  But, I love Jesus too. :)
2007-07-25T11:46:00.000Z	RickH	ilovejesus	 Seriously...  I haven't had any problems, but will no longer recommend it on #ubuntu.
2007-07-25T11:46:00.000Z	ilovejesus	RickH	for it ravaged my machine, very unholy like. Praise jesus!
2007-07-25T11:49:00.000Z	RickH	ilovejesus	 It's smitten with you, not smiting you. :)

2007-07-25T11:51:00.000Z	RickH	ilovejesus	 Hatred?
2007-07-25T11:51:00.000Z	RickH	ilovejesus	 Where are you being hated?
2007-07-25T11:52:00.000Z	RickH	ilovejesus	 One thing Jesus taught us is to meet people where they are... and engaging in activities which push people away isn't a good way of reaching the lost.  Love is though.  Work on that maybe? :)
