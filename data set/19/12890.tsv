2005-06-19T05:43:00.000Z	zukalk		i read this in some article: Another Note: Ubuntu installs with a default kernel set for i386 processors. Because I use an i686 kernel, I found upgrading also increased my system performance significantly. To do this, you can use Synaptic to search for linux-image-2.6.10-5-k7 if you use AMD or linux-image-2.6.10-5-686 for Pentium Pro/Celeron/Pentium II/Pentium III/Pentium IV.
2005-06-19T05:43:00.000Z	zukalk		and i was thinking of getting the 686 linux image
2005-06-19T05:44:00.000Z	zukalk		is there anything special i have to do, beside using Synaptic? (sounds too easy)
2005-06-19T05:44:00.000Z	zukalk		and what'll happen on reboot?
2005-06-19T05:46:00.000Z	nickrud	zukalk	yes, that simple.
2005-06-19T05:33:00.000Z	nickrud	zukalk	bigbill52a flodine the offical answer (as given by people who should know) is http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/BinaryDriverHowto, but, since I have neither an ati or nvidia, ymmv
2005-06-19T05:34:00.000Z	zukalk	nickrud	yeah, i've followed those, but the problem was actually monitor-related, the rest was fine
2005-06-19T05:34:00.000Z	nickrud	zukalk	then I'll shut up :)
2005-06-19T05:43:00.000Z	nickrud	zukalk	true
2005-06-19T05:44:00.000Z	nickrud	zukalk	no, and, while you're at it, change to libc6-i686
2005-06-19T05:45:00.000Z	nickrud	zukalk	grub had no problem changing over to the 686 kernel for me
2005-06-19T05:46:00.000Z	zukalk	nickrud	-- so is it really as simple as apt-getting linux-image-2.6.10-5-686 and libc6-i686 ?
2005-06-19T05:46:00.000Z	zukalk	nickrud	-- great, i'll try it later then ;)
2005-06-19T06:01:00.000Z	nickrud	zukalk	ymmv ;P
2005-06-19T06:01:00.000Z	nickrud	zukalk	this is what debian is good at
2005-06-19T06:13:00.000Z	zukalk	nickrud	- 686 is working fine, i just got back to 386 to get ndiswrapper woking on 686
2005-06-19T06:15:00.000Z	nickrud	zukalk	great
2005-06-19T06:16:00.000Z	nickrud	zukalk	you missed my last comment before you left, 'this is what debian is good at :)
2005-06-19T06:16:00.000Z	zukalk	nickrud	no doubt about that ;)
