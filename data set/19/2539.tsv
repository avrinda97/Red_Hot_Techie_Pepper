2010-03-16T15:02:00.000Z	edomeda	sqwertle	well that says it's working.   When you tried to run it, you use ./yourapp from the command line?
2010-03-16T15:03:00.000Z	sqwertle	edomeda	Nope.
2010-03-16T15:03:00.000Z	edomeda	sqwertle	ah, try that, from inside the directory
2010-03-16T15:03:00.000Z	sqwertle	edomeda	Well that most certainly solved that... Is it possible to execute it from the UI?
2010-03-16T15:04:00.000Z	edomeda	sqwertle	sure, use the codeblocks run menu option
2010-03-16T15:04:00.000Z	sqwertle	edomeda	So it can't be run standalone?
2010-03-16T15:04:00.000Z	edomeda	sqwertle	as long as you told codeblocks it's a terminal program, and to pause on exit, you should see it
2010-03-16T15:05:00.000Z	edomeda	sqwertle	not sure I understand, it's a console app, which needs to be run from inside a terminal.  What UI are you talking about?
2010-03-16T15:05:00.000Z	sqwertle	edomeda	The file browser I suppose?
2010-03-16T15:06:00.000Z	sqwertle	edomeda	Sorry, I come from programming in NT. I was hoping for it to be able to compile console applications in the way that an NT system would; run the executable it opens the console and runs, similarly if I were to run the executable from the file browser it would open the terminal and 'work'.
2010-03-16T15:07:00.000Z	edomeda	sqwertle	you just need to launch your terminal of choice, then use -e '/path/yourapp' to run it
2010-03-16T15:08:00.000Z	sqwertle	edomeda	So then something executalbe with a GUI would be capable of running without being launched from terminal but any sort of console application must be run from the terminal?
2010-03-16T15:08:00.000Z	edomeda	sqwertle	apps don't specifically run a term, you need to run it from inside one.  You can make a launcher shortcut to run say gnome-terminal, that then runs your app if that helps.
2010-03-16T15:09:00.000Z	sqwertle	edomeda	I'm sorry if I have too many questions, I'm trying to get my bearing after switching over from windows.
2010-03-16T15:10:00.000Z	edomeda	sqwertle	again, not sure what your asking, but you need to run a terminal app in the GUI (xorg) to see/run a console app, yes.
2010-03-16T15:11:00.000Z	edomeda	sqwertle	windows does the same thing, just auto-launches the cmd.exe for you.
2010-03-16T15:12:00.000Z	sqwertle	edomeda	Ah, thank you, that clarifies everything.
2010-03-16T15:12:00.000Z	edomeda	sqwertle	yw, gl
