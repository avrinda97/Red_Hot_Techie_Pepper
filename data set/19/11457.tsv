2006-01-19T06:11:00.000Z	pete_a		ok, BIG TIME rookie mistake.  I accidently removed the firefox dir under /opt
2006-01-19T06:11:00.000Z	pete_a		After your done laughing, can some please tell me how I reinstall firefox
2006-01-19T06:12:00.000Z	mwe	pete_a	like you did the first time :)
2006-01-19T06:13:00.000Z	mwe	pete_a	whatever suits you
2006-01-19T06:18:00.000Z	mwe	pete_a	did you install firefox 1.5 before following the wiki
2006-01-19T06:19:00.000Z	pete_a	mwe	Yes, but I've been trying to track down an issue and consequently screwing everything up
2006-01-19T06:19:00.000Z	mwe	pete_a	you probably used dpkg-divert in the process
2006-01-19T06:20:00.000Z	pete_a	mwe	 it just gets worse and worse.  not a good day in whoville
2006-01-19T06:20:00.000Z	mwe	pete_a	so the firefox executable is renamed
2006-01-19T06:20:00.000Z	pete_a	mwe	 ok,.  to what where?
2006-01-19T06:20:00.000Z	mwe	pete_a	sudo dpkg-divert --remove /usr/bin/firefox will get it back
2006-01-19T06:21:00.000Z	pete_a	mwe	 i'll try that,... thanks for now.
2006-01-19T06:23:00.000Z	pete_a	mwe	 i got the following:  Removing `local diversion of /usr/bin/firefox to /usr/bin/firefox.ubuntu'
2006-01-19T06:23:00.000Z	pete_a	mwe	 does that seem right?
2006-01-19T06:23:00.000Z	mwe	pete_a	sudo rm /usr/bin/firefox first
2006-01-19T06:23:00.000Z	mwe	pete_a	it's should be a broken symlink
2006-01-19T06:24:00.000Z	pete_a	mwe	 done.  then should i reinstall via synaptic b4 i use the wiki to get 1.5?
2006-01-19T06:25:00.000Z	pete_a	mwe	or is that already done?
2006-01-19T06:25:00.000Z	mwe	pete_a	see if it works now. if not reinstall it
