2008-01-21T11:41:00.000Z	CK_L		i got 1 monitor and 1 tv , how can i make it display the same thing...
2008-01-21T11:42:00.000Z	MrObvious	CK_L	What kind of TV?
2008-01-21T11:42:00.000Z	CK_L	MrObvious	normal TV
2008-01-21T11:43:00.000Z	MrObvious	CK_L	You mean NVidia FX5200? I have the same card on my downstairs machine.
2008-01-21T11:43:00.000Z	MrObvious	CK_L	Why a normal TV? It's not worth it at those horrible resolutions.
2008-01-21T11:45:00.000Z	CK_L	MrObvious	yup nividia fx5200 brand ATI
2008-01-21T11:46:00.000Z	MrObvious	CK_L	Uhh no. ATi and NVidia are opposite companies. ATi would never make an NVidia card (unless I've never heard of this one before?).
2008-01-21T11:46:00.000Z	CK_L	MrObvious	mine is ATI brand FX5200
2008-01-21T11:46:00.000Z	MrObvious	CK_L	Whatever.
2008-01-21T11:47:00.000Z	CK_L	MrObvious	so how to make it display on monitor and tv
2008-01-21T11:48:00.000Z	MrObvious	CK_L	What outputs does your video card have?
2008-01-21T11:48:00.000Z	CK_L	MrObvious	same like your fx5200 i think
2008-01-21T11:48:00.000Z	MrObvious	CK_L	Is it VGA and DVI? If so you can get some kind of converter for like DVI -> RGB or VGA -> RGB. Then just run the monitor off the other. Try that.
2008-01-21T11:52:00.000Z	CK_L	MrObvious	vga to my monitor dvi to my tv then how can i configure?
2008-01-21T11:53:00.000Z	MrObvious	CK_L	Just work with dual monitors and the NVidia driver. IDK how to do it from there but you'll get the idea. You'll have to set the second resolution probably manually.
2008-01-21T11:54:00.000Z	CK_L	MrObvious	do i need install ATI driver?
2008-01-21T11:55:00.000Z	CK_L	MrObvious	i use mplayer to watch rm and rmvb file it fine for me , because i cant solve realplayer problem :(
2008-01-21T11:55:00.000Z	MrObvious	CK_L	I like mplayer much better too.
2008-01-21T11:57:00.000Z	CK_L	MrObvious	now monitor and tv problem , too bad
