2004-11-17T11:25:00.000Z	gloin_		well, if any devs are listening, aside from the annoyances of moving to gnome (which really does feel like it's about 10 years behind KDE), nice distro!  Very well executed!  Keep up the good work.  I appreciate seeing the posts on bugtraq as well - lets me know the dev team is interested in keeping up with things.
2004-11-17T11:26:00.000Z	gloin_		heh
2004-11-17T11:26:00.000Z	gloin_		well
2004-11-17T11:26:00.000Z	gloin_		it is horrid
2004-11-17T11:26:00.000Z	gloin_		but the distro behind it makes it worthwhile
2004-11-17T11:26:00.000Z	gloin_		LOL
2004-11-17T11:26:00.000Z	gloin_		rofl
2004-11-17T11:26:00.000Z	gloin_		well
2004-11-17T11:27:00.000Z	gloin_		cool deal
2004-11-17T11:27:00.000Z	jdub	gloin_	gnome is not dumbed down. it just doesn't expect you to make it work properly yourself.
2004-11-17T11:28:00.000Z	jdub	gloin_	why force the user into understanding fifty million different options, when you can make things 'just work'?
2004-11-17T11:28:00.000Z	gloin_	jdub	gnome is so sumbed down - I'd like to be able to customize my menubar without looking in obscure, counter-intuitive places, and don't get me started about the whole win95-style filebrowser
2004-11-17T11:29:00.000Z	jdub	gloin_	the menu editing issue is well known; it's hidden because it doesn't work well.
2004-11-17T11:29:00.000Z	jdub	gloin_	the gtk+ 2.5 file browser is great.
2004-11-17T11:31:00.000Z	jdub	gloin_	the distro is impressive because it was designed with some of the same objectives as gnome.
2004-11-17T11:31:00.000Z	gloin_	jdub	??
2004-11-29T09:28:00.000Z	gloin_	jdub	please kickban
2004-11-29T09:31:00.000Z	jdub	gloin_	because there is no point responding unless it gets ridiculous.
2004-11-29T09:32:00.000Z	jdub	gloin_	and i would ask you to not encourage it by responding ni future.
