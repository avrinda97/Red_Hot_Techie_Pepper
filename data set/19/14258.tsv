2004-11-17T15:52:00.000Z	lml	bob2	faw? ahh - faq ;-) I have been looking but did not find anything.
2004-11-17T15:53:00.000Z	bob2	lml	there's a section on the website about it
2004-11-17T15:54:00.000Z	lml	bob2	The problem we are expirensing is not described in that section.
2004-11-17T15:54:00.000Z	bob2	lml	ask on the list
2004-11-17T15:55:00.000Z	lml	bob2	Ahh - yes it is. Had missed the very first part about going to recovery mode to get root access.
2004-11-17T15:55:00.000Z	lml	bob2	thx.
2004-11-17T15:58:00.000Z	lml	bob2	Actually it does not answer it completely.
2004-11-17T15:59:00.000Z	lml	bob2	When the installation reboots my friend is presented with a text login screen - not the continued installation process.
2004-11-17T16:00:00.000Z	bob2	lml	ok

2004-11-25T15:51:00.000Z	bob2	lml	no
2004-11-25T15:51:00.000Z	bob2	lml	just use cdrecord dev=/dev/hdc
2004-11-25T15:51:00.000Z	lml	bob2	Oki, so no cdrecored -scanbus?
2004-11-25T15:51:00.000Z	bob2	lml	right
2004-11-25T15:52:00.000Z	lml	bob2	thx.
2004-11-25T15:52:00.000Z	bob2	lml	you don't need that in 2.6, you just use the IDE device directly
