2011-10-29T19:29:00.000Z	pycoderf	Gentoo64	i have been googling for weeks with no luck. this is a clean install of ubuntu 10.04 server
2011-10-29T19:30:00.000Z	Gentoo64	pycoderf	did you have to install special drivers for it?
2011-10-29T19:30:00.000Z	pycoderf	Gentoo64	no they are supposedly built into the kernel
2011-10-29T19:30:00.000Z	Gentoo64	pycoderf	you could maybe try 11.10 (just to see if its a kernel thing)
2011-10-29T19:30:00.000Z	Gentoo64	pycoderf	^
2011-10-29T19:31:00.000Z	pycoderf	Gentoo64	i cant i tried it and can only boot into recovery mod forsome reason. it hangs at an error about system v startup scripts
2011-10-29T19:31:00.000Z	Gentoo64	pycoderf	11.04? i dont know what else to suggest. i cant get on google right now
2011-10-29T19:32:00.000Z	pycoderf	Gentoo64	probably sam issue but i used 11.10. also if i plug in a wsb drive what is the default device i should mount? i cant tell im using cli only
