2007-07-27T09:37:00.000Z	CaptainFrisbee	vikku	is your dual boot not working? Or do you just want to access an ntfs volume in ubuntu?
2007-07-27T09:40:00.000Z	CaptainFrisbee	vikku	so the windows partition isn't automatically mounted?
2007-07-27T09:41:00.000Z	vikku	CaptainFrisbee	No :(
2007-07-27T09:43:00.000Z	CaptainFrisbee	vikku	you can try something like: mount -t vfat /dev/hd?? /media/windows
