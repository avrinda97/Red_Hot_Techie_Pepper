2012-10-14T21:56:00.000Z	Abrackadabra		I have a problem which is easily solvable may be
2012-10-14T21:57:00.000Z	Abrackadabra		I have an ubuntu server, which shares internet from a LTE modem into a WiFi net
2012-10-14T21:57:00.000Z	Abrackadabra		I have also installed no-ip on it
2012-10-14T21:59:00.000Z	Abrackadabra		So, I can easily ssh to it from the wireless net. But I cannot do so from the internet, using the domain name given.
2012-10-14T21:59:00.000Z	Abrackadabra		Domain name resolves to an IP adress and .. connection timeouts
2012-10-14T22:00:00.000Z	kriskropd	Abrackadabra	do you have port 80 on the router forwarding to the local server ip?
2012-10-14T22:01:00.000Z	kriskropd	Abrackadabra	port 22 I meant
2012-10-14T22:01:00.000Z	kriskropd	Abrackadabra	or whatever port you have it set to
2012-10-14T22:03:00.000Z	kriskropd	Abrackadabra	modem or router should be able to do it portforwading.com may help

2012-10-14T22:07:00.000Z	kriskropd	Abrackadabra	so is it like, 3G? or something? is there any interface for it or is it controlled by the ISP entirely?
