2012-04-17T04:18:00.000Z	DrManhattan		ok so I want to make sure the gui doesn't start - what's the app - preferably a console app - to adjust my services
2012-04-17T04:18:00.000Z	yeik	DrManhattan	runlevel?
2012-04-17T04:20:00.000Z	yeik	DrManhattan	why not install ubuntu server? i don't think it has a gui
2012-04-17T04:20:00.000Z	DrManhattan	yeik	it's on a VM and I need the easycap driver
2012-04-17T04:39:00.000Z	yeik	DrManhattan	i thought you were using a virtual machine? maybe i haven't been paying attention
2012-04-17T04:40:00.000Z	yeik	DrManhattan	ok good. just didn't think virtual machine and software raid went together (for most people anyway)
2012-04-17T04:42:00.000Z	yeik	DrManhattan	you might be able to put the driver in 12.04
2012-04-17T04:43:00.000Z	DrManhattan	yeik	oh yeah its easy post install, but pre-install, you can't  parition the raid devices or install to them
2012-04-17T04:43:00.000Z	yeik	DrManhattan	so you need a pre-install environment. you can install a newer version of linux from an older bootable disk.
2012-04-17T04:44:00.000Z	DrManhattan	yeik	I don't know whats newer than 12.04
2012-04-17T04:44:00.000Z	yeik	DrManhattan	nothing now.
2012-04-17T04:52:00.000Z	yeik	DrManhattan	not sure about that. but it sounds like you just need the right drivers, if you could add them to the live-cd and installation i think it would work.
2012-04-17T04:53:00.000Z	DrManhattan	yeik	that would be pretty tight
2012-04-17T04:53:00.000Z	DrManhattan	yeik	but even with software raid it does this, so I don't think it's a driver issue
2012-04-17T04:54:00.000Z	yeik	DrManhattan	you mean hardware raid? software raid is high level, hardware is low level.
2012-04-17T04:55:00.000Z	DrManhattan	yeik	it gives me the error I discussed earlier with the created raid devices not appearing in the partitioner with software raid
2012-04-17T04:58:00.000Z	yeik	DrManhattan	i haven't tried lots of raids, i have seen too many of them fail. but when i do set them up, they just work. So i'm afraid im not much help really.
2012-04-17T04:58:00.000Z	DrManhattan	yeik	same here - especially in linux
2012-04-19T07:56:00.000Z	yeik	DrManhattan	cool!
