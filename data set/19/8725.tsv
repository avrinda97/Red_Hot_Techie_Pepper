2007-03-18T05:12:00.000Z	thcmonkey		ah well
2007-03-18T05:13:00.000Z	ikonia	thcmonkey	fesity support is in #ubuntu+1
2007-03-18T05:13:00.000Z	ikonia	thcmonkey	thats no reason - fesity support is #ubuntu+1 - address why they don't like you
2007-03-18T05:13:00.000Z	thcmonkey	ikonia	i think it's just because i don't know a huge amount
2007-03-18T05:14:00.000Z	ikonia	thcmonkey	thats no reason to discuss fesity problems in here, fesity support is #ubuntu+1 - ask yourself why if you don't know much your running an alpha product
2007-03-18T05:18:00.000Z	ikonia	thcmonkey	if you want to learn, learn from a stable build, not an alpha product
2007-03-18T05:18:00.000Z	thcmonkey	ikonia	yeah man, i got ya... but i may just wait 'till the 19th
2007-03-18T05:19:00.000Z	ikonia	thcmonkey	then I suggest you don't discuss feisty in here until the 19th
2007-03-18T05:26:00.000Z	ikonia	thcmonkey	thats nothing to do with ubuntu
2007-03-18T05:26:00.000Z	thcmonkey	ikonia	god man
