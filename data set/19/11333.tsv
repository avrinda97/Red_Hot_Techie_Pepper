2008-02-12T09:43:00.000Z	nomopofomo		how do i change the resolution of the login screen?
2008-02-12T09:43:00.000Z	Rubin	nomopofomo	it should be the same resolution as after you log in, isnt it?
2008-02-12T09:44:00.000Z	nomopofomo	Rubin	no.
2008-02-12T09:44:00.000Z	nomopofomo	Rubin	is there any way I might be able to restore all settings related to graphics like when everything was first installed?
2008-02-12T09:45:00.000Z	Rubin	nomopofomo	not all, but those settings are stored in /etc/X11/xorg.conf so you can back that up and restore it
2008-02-12T09:46:00.000Z	nomopofomo	Rubin	what about the login screen?
2008-02-12T09:47:00.000Z	Rubin	nomopofomo	some of it is in /etc/gdm/gdm.conf or local.conf
2008-02-12T09:52:00.000Z	nomopofomo	Rubin	where can I find local.conf?
2008-02-12T09:52:00.000Z	Rubin	nomopofomo	/etc/gdm
2008-02-12T10:01:00.000Z	Rubin	nomopofomo	how do you set it back?
2008-02-12T10:03:00.000Z	nomopofomo	Rubin	in screens and graphics.
2008-02-12T10:03:00.000Z	Rubin	nomopofomo	try logging out and pressing ctrl-alt-backspace
2008-02-12T10:03:00.000Z	nomopofomo	Rubin	what will that do btw?
2008-02-12T10:03:00.000Z	Rubin	nomopofomo	restart the x server
2008-02-12T10:06:00.000Z	nomopofomo	Rubin	it always resets to 1280x768.........
2008-02-12T10:06:00.000Z	Rubin	nomopofomo	thats odd. try editing /etc/X11/xorg.conf directly
2008-02-12T10:06:00.000Z	Rubin	nomopofomo	tbh i havnt really used the gui to do it
2008-02-12T10:07:00.000Z	nomopofomo	Rubin	in fact, I replaced the entire contents of the conf file with the contents of a file from 4 days ago when things were working fine.
2008-02-12T10:07:00.000Z	Rubin	nomopofomo	yeah, what Jack_Sparrow said.
