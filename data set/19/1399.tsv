2012-10-17T12:23:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	Tobias__	 it detects your HD and shows it contains los/found
2012-10-17T12:25:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	Tobias__	 type sudo fdisk -l |pastebinit and paste the url here
2012-10-17T12:26:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	Tobias__	 yes
2012-10-17T12:27:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	Tobias__	 no, use pastebinit, it returns a url, paste that here
2012-10-17T12:28:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	Tobias__	 you'll see, it's very easy and handy
2012-10-17T12:29:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	Tobias__	 great, now type sudo fdisk -l|pastebinit
2012-10-17T12:31:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	Tobias__	 is it a 3TB harddisk?
