2009-09-08T17:57:00.000Z	lardon		i have a laptop that has internet wireless and i want to share my connection to my PS3 via eth...
2009-09-08T17:57:00.000Z	twoslice	lardon	does the wireless act as an AP or only an end device?
2009-09-08T17:58:00.000Z	twoslice	lardon	usually a wireless nic can only be ad-hoc or point-to-point only no routing
2009-09-08T17:59:00.000Z	twoslice	lardon	can you do a traceroute to the Intnernet? where does it stop
2009-09-08T18:00:00.000Z	lardon	twoslice	i'll have to leave to check it

2009-09-08T18:04:00.000Z	twoslice	lardon	if you use traceroute you can findout where the traffic is being stopped
2009-09-08T18:04:00.000Z	twoslice	lardon	use and ip address for traceroute not a name to rule out name resolution issues
2009-09-08T18:05:00.000Z	twoslice	lardon	on the laptop?
2009-09-08T18:05:00.000Z	twoslice	lardon	what is your default route?
2009-09-08T18:12:00.000Z	twoslice	lardon	as long as you use the same subnet mask for all devices on your network you should be fine.
2009-09-08T18:18:00.000Z	twoslice	lardon	where you at with things?
2009-09-08T18:19:00.000Z	twoslice	lardon	you got things working?
