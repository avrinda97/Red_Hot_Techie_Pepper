2011-03-05T20:46:00.000Z	keith27		how come i get an icmp destination unreachable (port unreachable) like every second on my lo interface ?
2011-03-05T20:47:00.000Z	keith27		jasonn the port is closed but what could be creating the failed attempts in the first place ?
2011-03-05T20:49:00.000Z	keith27		jasonn im not trying to ping it or anything i'm trying to figure out what is running
2011-03-05T20:49:00.000Z	edbian	keith27	If something was running you could ping it
2011-03-06T05:18:00.000Z	edbian	keith27	What's the problem?
2011-03-06T05:19:00.000Z	edbian	keith27	I'll research a bit.  Since it is to and from localhost it's your computer talking to itself (not a security flaw)
2011-03-06T05:21:00.000Z	edbian	keith27	That is a non-standard port which is a bad sing.
2011-03-06T05:21:00.000Z	keith27	edbian	before this use to happen i use to get connections on strange ports to other ip's, just recently they always show as localhost.  im worried that firestarter is showing localhost when in fact it could be something else.  maybe firestarter itself is compromised?
2011-03-06T05:22:00.000Z	edbian	keith27	That would be very surprising as it would be an extremely elaborate attack
2011-03-06T05:22:00.000Z	edbian	keith27	Although it is possible if you've been installing and running random software
2011-03-06T05:22:00.000Z	edbian	keith27	Like outside of the repos
2011-03-06T05:23:00.000Z	edbian	keith27	Take a look at netstat -ao
2011-03-06T05:24:00.000Z	edbian	keith27	Umm, yeah.  It would probably take them at least months to put together such an elaborate attack.
2011-03-06T05:26:00.000Z	edbian	keith27	hahaha, ok
2011-03-06T05:26:00.000Z	edbian	keith27	can you pastebin netstat -ao for me?
2011-03-06T05:27:00.000Z	keith27	edbian	its longer than the terminal shows
2011-03-06T05:27:00.000Z	edbian	keith27	I think maybe there is some program that we don't understand using localhost for app - app communication (that is a thing).  That or there is a packet generator doing random nonsence
2011-03-06T05:27:00.000Z	edbian	keith27	You can set the scroll back in edit -> profile preferences
2011-03-06T07:02:00.000Z	keith27	edbian	is a god, you all should bow to him
