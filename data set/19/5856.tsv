2008-04-26T00:21:00.000Z	nucco	thomasc599	what graphic card are you using?
2008-04-26T00:23:00.000Z	thomasc599	nucco	> how do i find that out?
2008-04-26T00:23:00.000Z	nucco	thomasc599	no straightforward way that I know of... when you do dpkg-reconfigure, what driver does it select by default?

2008-04-26T00:25:00.000Z	nucco	thomasc599	when you do the dpkg thingy, what's the first thing that shows up, what option is highlighted by default?
2008-04-26T00:26:00.000Z	thomasc599	nucco	> a thing about a video frame buffer
2008-04-26T00:26:00.000Z	nucco	thomasc599	hmmm... it doesn't ask you to select a driver?
2008-04-26T00:27:00.000Z	thomasc599	nucco	> no
2008-04-26T00:27:00.000Z	nucco	thomasc599	do "lspci" in a terminal and paste the output somewhere, then give me the link, lemme see if I can make something out of it
2008-04-26T00:27:00.000Z	thomasc599	nucco	> i edited the xorg.conf to put this in "Modes       "1280x800"
2008-04-26T00:28:00.000Z	nucco	thomasc599	probably using the wrong drivers, we gotta identify which one you should be using first

2008-04-26T00:34:00.000Z	nucco	thomasc599	been trying to open that since, my darn connection is giving me 550Bytes per second :(
2008-04-26T00:34:00.000Z	thomasc599	nucco	> kk
2008-04-26T00:40:00.000Z	nucco	thomasc599	somethings wrong with your xorg.conf
