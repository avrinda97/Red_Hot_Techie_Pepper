2006-06-02T14:57:00.000Z	GuerillaTactiks		How do I slow down the gnome menus? They open too fast, they look like they are flickering, I would like them to slide open if possible.
2006-06-02T14:58:00.000Z	GuerillaTactiks		Anyway to slow down the menus in gnome?
2006-06-02T14:59:00.000Z	Warbo	GuerillaTactiks	You can't get them to slide, but you can get them to fade
2006-06-02T14:59:00.000Z	GuerillaTactiks	Warbo	: How?
2006-06-02T15:00:00.000Z	Warbo	GuerillaTactiks	Either use XGL or Composite
2006-06-02T15:00:00.000Z	GuerillaTactiks	Warbo	: You lost me, say that again
2006-06-02T15:01:00.000Z	Warbo	GuerillaTactiks	Either XGL (all of those fancy, wobbly window things) or just composite (an extension to X, letting you have shadows and fades)
2006-06-02T15:01:00.000Z	GuerillaTactiks	Warbo	: Where are these options
2006-06-02T15:02:00.000Z	Warbo	GuerillaTactiks	I don't know of a guide for composite, I would have to walk you through it, but there is one for XGL if you choose that route
2006-06-02T15:06:00.000Z	GuerillaTactiks	Warbo	: Seems a little difficult, and untested, isnt there an easier way?
2006-06-02T15:06:00.000Z	Warbo	GuerillaTactiks	XGL is a little unstable, but Composite is easier
2006-06-02T15:06:00.000Z	Warbo	GuerillaTactiks	First install xcompmgr ("sudo apt-get install xcompmgr")
2006-06-02T15:08:00.000Z	Warbo	GuerillaTactiks	OK
2006-06-02T15:09:00.000Z	Warbo	GuerillaTactiks	Rubbish? Dunno, change the preferences (and maybe install ms truetype fonts)
2006-06-02T15:10:00.000Z	Warbo	GuerillaTactiks	There is a package in multiverse I think
2006-06-02T15:17:00.000Z	Warbo	GuerillaTactiks	I have no idea
2006-06-02T15:23:00.000Z	Warbo	GuerillaTactiks	I actually use a font called Comic Book, but you probably won't want that :)
2006-06-02T15:29:00.000Z	Warbo	GuerillaTactiks	Are you sure it is enabled? Look in Settings>Repositories, select the Dapper repo and click edit. Make sure multiverse is ticked and reload
2006-06-02T15:30:00.000Z	Warbo	GuerillaTactiks	Dunno then
