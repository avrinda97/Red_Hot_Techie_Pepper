2005-09-30T08:13:00.000Z	Xorlev	steely	Does your network config have a valid DNS server?
2005-09-30T08:14:00.000Z	Xorlev	steely	Can you ping within the network?
2005-09-30T08:14:00.000Z	Xorlev	steely	Sounds like DNS problems to me. Can you try pinging a known external IP?
2005-09-30T08:17:00.000Z	Xorlev	steely	So its just one site?
2005-09-30T08:18:00.000Z	Xorlev	steely	The site could be down. Which site?
2005-09-30T08:24:00.000Z	Xorlev	steely	heheh, sometimes ISPs are quirky.
2005-09-30T08:24:00.000Z	Xorlev	steely	iptables, but Firestarter is a GUI frontend to it.
2005-09-30T08:31:00.000Z	Xorlev	steely	Never used it.
2005-09-30T08:32:00.000Z	Xorlev	steely	Firestarter is about as basic as it gets.
