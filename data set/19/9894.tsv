2006-08-31T06:59:00.000Z	sethk	new11	from the terminal?  control-z
2006-08-31T06:59:00.000Z	sethk	new11	then bg
2006-08-31T07:00:00.000Z	sethk	new11	is that what you meant?
2006-08-31T07:00:00.000Z	sethk	new11	already running, you type control-z
2006-08-31T07:00:00.000Z	sethk	new11	before it starts, whatever&
2006-08-31T07:00:00.000Z	sethk	new11	jobs -l to list background jobs
2006-08-31T07:01:00.000Z	sethk	new11	if you want it to continue to run even if you close the terminal, use nohup
2006-08-31T07:02:00.000Z	sethk	new11	yes
2006-08-31T07:02:00.000Z	sethk	new11	control-z is if you forgot to do the & initially
2006-08-31T07:02:00.000Z	sethk	new11	or intentionally didn't do it, for that matter
2006-08-31T07:02:00.000Z	sethk	new11	jobs -l will lists jobs running in the background
2006-08-31T07:03:00.000Z	new11	sethk	ty :)
2006-08-31T07:03:00.000Z	sethk	new11	fg will bring it back into the foreground (bring back the most recent if there is more than one)
2006-08-31T07:03:00.000Z	sethk	new11	jobs -l only lists background jobs started by that particular shell.  you can see all of your processes using ps.
2006-08-31T07:05:00.000Z	new11	sethk	wont it show up in ps x?
2006-08-31T07:05:00.000Z	sethk	new11	yes
2006-08-31T07:06:00.000Z	sethk	new11	lots of ways to do it.  as I said, jobs -l are the jobs run by one shell.  ps aux | grep username   will get all your processes, foreground, background, etc.
2006-08-31T07:06:00.000Z	sethk	new11	you mentioned ps x; I usually use ps ax
2006-08-31T07:07:00.000Z	sethk	new11	you've got both the bsd ps syntax and the system V ps syntax, so there are a _lot_ of interesting ps variations
