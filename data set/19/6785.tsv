2008-05-13T04:28:00.000Z	bluefoxx		whears the magical hidden trash folder gone to now? uit used to be /home/<user>/.trash but its changed locations and now i cant delete corrupted items from the command line[sudo rm -R /home/bluefoxx/.trash/*] as my computer decided to freeze while i was moving a folder between disk drives
2008-05-13T04:28:00.000Z	bluefoxx		speaking of which, my computer has been completely freezing a lot lately
2008-05-13T04:28:00.000Z	bluefoxx		when im doing not much on it[only burning a disk or browsing the web/files]
2008-05-13T04:29:00.000Z	bluefoxx		even reisub stops working
2008-05-13T04:29:00.000Z	mneptok	bluefoxx	/home/$USERNAME/.local/share/Trash/files
2008-05-13T04:30:00.000Z	bluefoxx	mneptok	tyvm ^^ [now i can go back to working a little more efficiently]
2008-05-13T04:49:00.000Z	bluefoxx	mneptok	i got a ISA card working in my other machine
2008-05-13T04:49:00.000Z	bluefoxx	mneptok	no reason he cant, provided he can find the correct module
2008-05-13T04:49:00.000Z	mneptok	bluefoxx	feel free to help do that. i'll cut my losses and recommend a 2 quid PCI sound card ;)
2008-05-13T04:50:00.000Z	bluefoxx	mneptok	i find that the awe64pro i had from my first computer runs very nicely so far :)
2008-05-13T04:50:00.000Z	mneptok	bluefoxx	cool, my AWE64 refused due to BIOS oddness.
2008-05-13T04:50:00.000Z	mneptok	bluefoxx	but hey, maybe this guy has your BIOS. ;)
2008-05-13T04:51:00.000Z	mneptok	bluefoxx	2 quid soundcard = waaaaaaaay easier
2008-05-13T04:51:00.000Z	bluefoxx	mneptok	ouch:( you tried PnP?
2008-05-13T04:51:00.000Z	mneptok	bluefoxx	oh yes.
2008-05-13T04:51:00.000Z	bluefoxx	mneptok	cheap PCI== fired my mobo T_T
2008-05-13T05:24:00.000Z	mneptok	bluefoxx	the extra T is for "try not to notice." kthxbai.
