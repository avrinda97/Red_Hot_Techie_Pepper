2006-07-29T06:20:00.000Z	davey_		I followed all the instructions it just didn't work
2006-07-29T06:20:00.000Z	ex-parrot	davey_	all you need to do is edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf and change the driver
2006-07-29T06:20:00.000Z	davey_	ex-parrot	can you tell me what to put in it?
2006-07-29T06:20:00.000Z	ex-parrot	davey_	you could switch it to "ati" from "fglrx" to get you back up and running
2006-07-29T06:22:00.000Z	davey_	ex-parrot	so I should naviagate in console to /ect/X11/xorg.conf and type nano xorg.config and then when i see the file look for flxglx and put ati their? I really am lost
2006-07-29T06:23:00.000Z	davey_	ex-parrot	seriously I have no idea where hat is in the file, so should I just boot it up and look around?
2006-07-29T06:25:00.000Z	davey_	ex-parrot	I'm going to try that right now i'll be back
2006-07-29T06:39:00.000Z	davey_	ex-parrot	you stil their
2006-07-29T06:40:00.000Z	davey_	ex-parrot	configured it wrong, when it asks me the question how much memorty to give my graphics card it doesn't fill it in for me and I think my card doesn't have any memory on it
2006-07-29T06:41:00.000Z	davey_	ex-parrot	and while I'm working on it, sometimes it would fliker with the old graphics driver, can that be fixed with the new config I have to do
