2011-10-16T09:17:00.000Z	polecat		Hi, I'm trying to get the unity dock to go to my primary (right) monitor.  Has anyone found a workaround for this?  I'm aware of the current discussion on the bug reports page, and have tried fooling with nvidia settings and compizconfig.  I just upgraded to Oneiric
2011-10-16T09:19:00.000Z	zoclo	polecat	i gonna try nomodeset, im very new in this enviroment
