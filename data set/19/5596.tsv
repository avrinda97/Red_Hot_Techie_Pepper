2008-09-09T05:47:00.000Z	jamrun9		Seeing as folks are coming and going, I hope no one takes offense if I re-post my original question...
2008-09-09T05:48:00.000Z	soundray	jamrun9	that's okay if you've left at least 10 minutes
2008-09-09T05:52:00.000Z	jamrun9	soundray	Installed ubuntu-restricted-extras, seems to not have changed anything...
2008-09-09T05:53:00.000Z	jamrun9	soundray	disregard, I have another thing to try.
2008-09-09T05:54:00.000Z	soundray	jamrun9	try loading an mp3 file into totem. It should offer to download codecs for you.
2008-09-09T05:55:00.000Z	soundray	jamrun9	failing that, use the medibuntu repository and install w32codecs (or w64codecs if you're on 64bit)
2008-09-09T05:55:00.000Z	jamrun9	soundray	yep, that's what I'm doing right now
2008-09-09T05:55:00.000Z	soundray	jamrun9	medibuntu?
2008-09-09T05:56:00.000Z	jamrun9	soundray	yep
2008-09-09T05:59:00.000Z	jamrun9	soundray	=/ and failing both restricted-extras and w32codecs... what now?
2008-09-09T06:00:00.000Z	soundray	jamrun9	try loading an mp3 file into totem?
2008-09-09T06:01:00.000Z	soundray	jamrun9	or just 'cat file.mp3 >/dev/audio'. Mind you, you will have to train your brain to do the MP3 decoding.
2008-09-09T06:01:00.000Z	jamrun9	soundray	the song loads, loads the data, says 0:00/time... and just doesn't play.
2008-09-09T06:01:00.000Z	jamrun9	soundray	heh. I'd rather watch youtube recordings.
2008-09-09T06:02:00.000Z	soundray	jamrun9	tried mplayer? It tends to at least give some meaningful error output.
2008-09-09T06:02:00.000Z	jamrun9	soundray	I'll grab it.
2008-09-09T06:02:00.000Z	soundray	jamrun9	perhaps it's something stupid and you just have to (gasp) reboot
2008-09-09T06:04:00.000Z	jamrun9	soundray	MPlayer does... nothing.
2008-09-09T06:04:00.000Z	jamrun9	soundray	meh, been having this issue for a while. Amarok was the only player that's worked.
