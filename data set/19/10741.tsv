2006-08-31T14:09:00.000Z	Lieter		a linux newbie here, i installed kubuntu a few days ago and i did an upgrade, but now everytime i try to login in my KDE enviroment it returns me to the login. i already downgraded the xorg server from 10.4 to 10(cd version) but no cigar. Ideas anyone? btw i cant use my ethernet in commandline mode.. it worked in the graphical enviroment.
2006-08-31T14:10:00.000Z	Tonren	Lieter	That's pretty bizarre.  Have you tried reinstalling?
2006-08-31T14:10:00.000Z	Tonren	Lieter	(sorry to suggest such a spartan tactic)
2006-08-31T14:11:00.000Z	Lieter	Tonren	prefer not to, i'm happy itsa dual boot now... had some bad experiances with grub in the past ;)
2006-08-31T14:11:00.000Z	Tonren	Lieter	Can you login from the command prompt?  At the login window, use Ctrl + Alt + F1 to drop beneath Xorg, and login.
2006-08-31T14:12:00.000Z	Lieter	Tonren	yes i can, but my ethernet card doesnt work then, so i cant apt-get etc.. i downgraded the xorg server to teh on eon the install cd (version 10.. compared to 10.4 that was upgraded)
2006-08-31T14:13:00.000Z	Tonren	Lieter	That's strange.  Your ethernet card should function without Xorg.
2006-08-31T14:14:00.000Z	Lieter	Tonren	it all works,works finw when booted in wondows, and it worked in ubuntu
2006-08-31T14:17:00.000Z	Tonren	Lieter	But your internet just doesn't work until Xorg is booted, huh?  That's awfully strange.  And you still have this Kubuntu problem.  Hmmm...
2006-08-31T14:18:00.000Z	Lieter	Tonren	yeah thats what i though, ping says it cant resolve, and ifconfig doesnt staat my ip
2006-08-31T14:19:00.000Z	Tonren	Lieter	What is the exact behavior of your Kubuntu login?  What happens from when you hit "Enter" on the password dialogue?
2006-08-31T14:20:00.000Z	Lieter	Tonren	black screen, some gitter, blackscreen, and then back to the login
2006-08-31T14:21:00.000Z	Tonren	Lieter	Use Ctrl + Alt + F1 to drop into terminal and take a look at the output of "dmesg"
2006-08-31T14:21:00.000Z	Tonren	Lieter	You can drop back into Xorg with Ctrl + Alt + F7.
2006-08-31T14:21:00.000Z	Lieter	Tonren	ok
2006-08-31T14:22:00.000Z	Tonren	Lieter	Are you familiar with pipes and the grep command?
2006-08-31T14:22:00.000Z	Lieter	Tonren	i can manage that yes
2006-08-31T14:22:00.000Z	Tonren	Lieter	OK.  You may want to try grepping for KDE, Xorg, etc.
2006-08-31T14:23:00.000Z	Lieter	Tonren	ok will do(switch to pm maybe?)
