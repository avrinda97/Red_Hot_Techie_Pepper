2010-04-28T20:12:00.000Z	jbwiv		guys, I experience pretty regular system freezes. Hard freezes... magic sysrq won't even work. Turned off Compiz...the lockups happen much less frequently. Replaced video card, no dice. Replaced RAM, and it seemed to fix if for a few days, but after upgrading to Lucid, seems the lockups are back. Opened case, all fans are working properly. I'm not sure what to do at this point. Could it be the motherboard? Something with Linux itself?
2010-04-28T20:12:00.000Z	acicula	jbwiv	what kind of computer
2010-04-28T20:15:00.000Z	jbwiv	acicula	it's a home-built one
2010-04-28T20:16:00.000Z	jbwiv	acicula	asus motherboard, dual quad core xeons, 12 gb ram
2010-04-28T20:16:00.000Z	acicula	jbwiv	what kind of psu(brand model wattage) and what hardware
2010-04-28T20:17:00.000Z	jbwiv	acicula	500W OCZ ps, Asus Z8NA-D6 board
2010-04-28T20:17:00.000Z	acicula	jbwiv	what gpu?
2010-04-28T20:17:00.000Z	jbwiv	acicula	we built 12 of them, all running ubuntu. As far as I know, I'm the only one experiening lockups
2010-04-28T20:17:00.000Z	jbwiv	acicula	GeForce 9800 GT
2010-04-28T20:18:00.000Z	jbwiv	acicula	the only difference between mine and the others is that I have a Netgear WG311T wireless adapter installed
2010-04-28T20:18:00.000Z	acicula	jbwiv	well its not an exceptionally heavy psu for that config but it should be enough
2010-04-28T20:19:00.000Z	jbwiv	acicula	would you think a bad motherboard is a possibility?
2010-04-28T20:19:00.000Z	jbwiv	acicula	for what it's worth, it's much more stable with Compiz disabled for some reason
2010-04-28T20:19:00.000Z	jbwiv	acicula	which is why I tried replacing the Gfx card, but the problem persisted
2010-04-28T20:20:00.000Z	acicula	jbwiv	if you load it heavily without a gui can you make it crash?
2010-04-28T20:20:00.000Z	acicula	jbwiv	if it has an igp can you try using that and remove the gpu/wireless
2010-04-28T20:20:00.000Z	jbwiv	acicula	I haven't tried that. igp?
2010-04-28T20:20:00.000Z	acicula	jbwiv	integrated graphics card on the motherboard
2010-04-28T20:22:00.000Z	jbwiv	acicula	seems odd that lmsensors doesn't support it? yes, I was sad
