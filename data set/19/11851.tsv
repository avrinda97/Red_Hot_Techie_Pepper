2006-11-22T17:59:00.000Z	recon		Does anybody know a tr/sed command to extract extensions (delete everything after the frist dot including the dot)?
2006-11-22T06:00:00.000Z	LjL	recon	"basename" if often used for that, but you have to specify which extension
2006-11-22T06:01:00.000Z	LjL	recon	a stupid shell command could be "echo whateverfilename | rev | cut -f1 "." | rev"
2006-11-22T06:01:00.000Z	LjL	recon	well no actually, that does the opposite -
2006-11-22T06:02:00.000Z	recon	LjL	I'm trying to batch sox to convert about 13 .ogg files to .mp3 (due to player restrictions) so that info 'll work.
2006-11-22T06:02:00.000Z	LjL	recon	"basename" should be fine for that
2007-10-02T12:53:00.000Z	recon	LjL	if you're there, i reported the xchat TCL thing as a bug at https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xchat/+bug/148222 , you can confirm it if you like.
2007-12-06T02:41:00.000Z	recon	LjL	i thought that was rather obvious, due to his name.
2008-10-26T19:02:00.000Z	LjL	recon	like we'd care
2008-10-26T19:02:00.000Z	recon	LjL	:P
2008-12-06T19:33:00.000Z	recon	LjL	http://www.lockergnome.com/it/2007/01/23/video-editing-for-ubuntu/
2008-12-06T19:37:00.000Z	LjL	recon	i'd try kdenlive and i know of others, but i'd like to at least know whether they support cropping, at the very least
2008-12-06T19:38:00.000Z	recon	LjL	avidemux, then?
2008-12-06T19:38:00.000Z	recon	LjL	http://fixounet.free.fr/avidemux/
2008-12-06T19:39:00.000Z	LjL	recon	uhm the avidemux package description says it supports "filtering", so that might be interesting
2008-12-06T19:39:00.000Z	recon	LjL	"Avidemux is a free video editor designed for simple cutting, filtering and encoding tasks. It supports many file types, including AVI, DVD compatible MPEG files, MP4 and ASF, using a variety of codecs. Tasks can be automated using projects, job queue and powerful scripting capabilities." I assume "cutting" == "cropping".
2008-12-06T19:40:00.000Z	LjL	recon	no i think "cutting" just means removing frames to edit
2008-12-06T19:40:00.000Z	LjL	recon	but i'm looking at the documentation about filtering, and it does indeed have a cropping filter.
2008-12-06T19:40:00.000Z	recon	LjL	Oh.
