2011-07-02T00:53:00.000Z	stephenh		i'm still quite nooby with ubuntu/debian
2011-07-02T00:54:00.000Z	stephenh		running it on my work pc now though, so forced to learn :)
2011-07-02T00:54:00.000Z	oCean	stephenh	you run ubuntu or debian?
2011-07-02T00:54:00.000Z	oCean	stephenh	and on the desktop you want to install build-essential?
2011-07-02T00:55:00.000Z	oCean	stephenh	ok. What happens if you run  apt-cache search build-essential
2011-07-02T00:55:00.000Z	stephenh	oCean	already resolved it, i hadn't updated my repos
2011-08-19T15:47:00.000Z	oCean	stephenh	there is apt-file search (have to install apt-file package) and dpkg -S /path/to/file is similar to rpm -qf /path/to/file
2011-08-19T15:48:00.000Z	stephenh	oCean	this is to show where an existing file comes from?
2011-08-19T15:49:00.000Z	oCean	stephenh	dpkg -S is to show for existing file, apt-file will show you any file matching the searchstring (in the packages available in repository, similar to yum whatprovides)
2011-08-19T15:50:00.000Z	stephenh	oCean	nice, will remember that thanks
2011-08-19T15:54:00.000Z	oCean	stephenh	use -F to prevent that  apt-file search -F /bin/cp
