2006-01-08T13:31:00.000Z	Jonc101		ah ok ill check it out.  but let me explain why i need it and maybe you can give me some direction here.  i have a couple xp boxes that are unable to logon to a domain wirelessly with users that have roaming profiles, the reason for this is that the windows wireless zero config utility hasnt started at pre-logon so hence the box cant see the domain.  what i was thinking of doing was setting up linux and then installing xp with a vmwar
2006-01-08T13:32:00.000Z	Jonc101		would i be able to do that above with ubuntu?
2006-01-08T13:34:00.000Z	Jonc101		so my little hack is to use linux to maintain the wireless connection.  windows will be unaware of this and simply see a network connection allowing users to login logout etc
2006-01-08T13:34:00.000Z	Jonc101		mwe?
2006-01-08T13:35:00.000Z	Jonc101		i just need linux to support the infrastructure.  ill load windows xp up on top of a vmware-type app which will allow the users to do their thing.
2006-01-08T13:36:00.000Z	ScootaDoota	Jonc101	that sounds very messy to me
2006-01-08T13:37:00.000Z	Jonc101	blue-frog	about 5 users in this scenario.  schoota, ya very messy lol but if it works :D.
2006-01-08T13:38:00.000Z	ScootaDoota	Jonc101	what spec machines are your clients using
2006-01-08T13:38:00.000Z	Jonc101		scoota: p4 3.0ghz, 512mb ram.  they're hp dc7100sff 's
2006-01-08T13:39:00.000Z	Jonc101		bluefrog how does that work?
2006-01-08T13:39:00.000Z	ScootaDoota	Jonc101	okay they are good enough spec for vmware, but I reckon there must be a way of doing this without going the Linux/vmware method
2006-01-08T13:40:00.000Z	Jonc101		scoota ye i wish there was a way to do this windows only but if microsoft doesnt even know how to solve the problem then i'd say its an issue
2006-01-08T13:40:00.000Z	Jonc101		bluefrog: no, the problem is that (in windows) the wireless connection doesnt start until after you have logged on.
2006-01-08T13:41:00.000Z	ScootaDoota		 Jonc101: okay...and they can't log on until they get the domain!
2006-01-08T13:42:00.000Z	ScootaDoota	Jonc101	chicken and egg situation.......hmmm...you can't be the first one to have encountered this one
2006-01-08T13:43:00.000Z	Jonc101		Okay let me rephrase thing's a little, I think I'm being a bit confusing.  We have 5 desktop computers that sit in a warehouse, its very difficult to pull a network cable so they have wireless cards.  The users are people that update items in a database, they all have roaming profiles.  The problem lies in them being un-able to log onto the windows domain because at the 'Ctrl-Alt-Dlt' screen the wireless connection hasn't started.  So
2006-01-08T13:44:00.000Z	ScootaDoota	Jonc101	i'm sure the wireless connection should be up and running before the user logs in
2006-01-08T13:46:00.000Z	Jonc101		scoota: thats the thing, it doesnt start, and it SET to start in services.msc but it doesnt thats the bug.  and because im using PEAP and 802.1x authentication (which is user dependant) i am unable to establish the wireless connection.  the wireless connection does work AFTER you've loggged on with cached logon credentials
2006-01-08T13:47:00.000Z	ScootaDoota	Jonc101	good old windows!.....do these clients have to run Windows...you can't migrate them to Linux?
