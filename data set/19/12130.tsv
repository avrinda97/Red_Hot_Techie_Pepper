2005-12-12T13:25:00.000Z	AceMilo		5.10 comse with 1.07 version of firefox but 1.5 is the newest, how do you update it?
2005-12-12T13:25:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	AceMilo	We're still waiting on the Breezy build of 1.5.
2005-12-12T13:26:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	AceMilo	If you want you can still get it from http://www.getfirefox.com, but most people are content to wait.
2005-12-12T13:28:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	AceMilo	Try changing the umask in /etc/fstab.
2005-12-12T13:30:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	AceMilo	I believe you just need to edit the string defaults to defaults,umask=000 on the line for the drive in question.
2005-12-12T13:31:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	AceMilo	You could use other numbers there if you want; 000 allow full permissions for everyone.  The numbers for umask are just the opposite for the file permissions ones, so umask=000 equates to perm.s of 777.
2005-12-12T13:32:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	AceMilo	You'll have to umount and mount it again.
2005-12-12T13:33:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	AceMilo	Make sure to say umount not unmount.
2005-12-12T13:33:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	AceMilo	Very common mistake.
2005-12-12T13:34:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	AceMilo	Same process, mount <mountpoint>.
2005-12-12T13:34:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	AceMilo	Isn't it nice when things do that?
2005-12-12T13:36:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	AceMilo	They would usually be named installer, install, or something obvious.  Otherwise, it doesn't really look any different.
2005-12-12T13:37:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	AceMilo	I don't think I can help you there.
2005-12-12T13:38:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	AceMilo	Doesn't that come as a package though so you wouldn't have to?
2005-12-12T13:40:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	AceMilo	libglib maybe?  I'm not really familiar with this one.
2005-12-12T13:44:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	AceMilo	& Kyral: Is it considered "executing" to play an MP3?
2005-12-12T13:54:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	AceMilo	You can, but it's best to check for Ubuntu ones first.
2005-12-12T13:55:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	AceMilo	They aren't identical, but a lot of Debian stuff will still run just fine.  Most things are included in the Ubuntu repos, but for the things that aren't you can use Debian's.
2005-12-12T13:56:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	AceMilo	VLC is in the Ubuntu universe repo.
