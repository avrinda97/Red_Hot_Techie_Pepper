2007-06-03T06:07:00.000Z	clouder`grr		I did something really weird, and I don't know how I did it.  I was trying to alt-tab between windows but mashed some keys and my file menu tore away from my application.  Then I tried to emulate the same smashing of keys and the file menu want back to the application but it's not at the very top.  Anyone know how to fix this?

2007-06-03T06:11:00.000Z	Azzkikr	clouder`grr	oh right... it's an application. I thought the gnome-panel
2007-06-03T06:12:00.000Z	Azzkikr	clouder`grr	of course, you've tried dragging, right clock on  the menu's
2007-06-03T06:13:00.000Z	clouder`grr	Azzkikr	yeah I've tried middle button dragging ctrl dragging everything pretty much
2007-06-03T06:19:00.000Z	Azzkikr	clouder`grr	oh, nevermind, misunderstood. Did you enable detachable menu's in System->Prefernces->Menu's and toolbars?
2007-06-03T06:14:00.000Z	Azzkikr	clouder`grr	probably, PenguinTV stores it's data in ~/.penguintv/ or the like. Perhaps if you delete that directory the UI will be restored. However, all your data for PenguinTV  will be removed too. Try making a backup of that directory, and then removing it alltogether (last resort :))
2007-06-03T06:15:00.000Z	Azzkikr	clouder`grr	hmmm... consult that application then :D
2007-06-03T06:16:00.000Z	clouder`grr	Azzkikr	want to see what it looks like with the File menu torn off just for kicks?
2007-06-03T06:16:00.000Z	Azzkikr	clouder`grr	sure heh

2007-06-03T06:18:00.000Z	Azzkikr	clouder`grr	what on earth?!
2007-06-03T06:18:00.000Z	clouder`grr	Azzkikr	nutty eh?
2007-06-03T06:18:00.000Z	Azzkikr	clouder`grr	what application was it that you mentioned which enables such behaviour?
2007-06-03T06:19:00.000Z	clouder`grr	Azzkikr	what do you mean?  So far it's only done it with PenguinTV
2007-06-03T06:21:00.000Z	clouder`grr	Azzkikr	nope it's unchecked.  I fixed it though finally, I just kept selecting different menus and smashing alt tab and space and it went back
2007-06-03T06:21:00.000Z	Azzkikr	clouder`grr	err... very odd heh. I hope it's a 'feature' from Penguin TV!
2007-06-03T06:23:00.000Z	clouder`grr	Azzkikr	yeah, seems like it only happens with PenguinTV.  I tried doing it with filezilla and firefox and got nothing
