2012-02-26T06:06:00.000Z	bluezone		i'm experiencing video tearing and when i enable ati's "tear free desktop" option, it only lags the film and makes it worse, any ideas?
2012-02-26T06:06:00.000Z	gogeta	bluezone	does not enabling it fix it
2012-02-26T06:07:00.000Z	bluezone	gogeta	no, it makes the video lag an extreme amount if it's in fullscreen
2012-02-26T06:07:00.000Z	gogeta	bluezone	it sounds like a conflict with the gl rendering
2012-02-26T06:07:00.000Z	bluezone	gogeta	gl?
2012-02-26T06:08:00.000Z	gogeta	bluezone	yea those 3d effects are open gl and its also used to acell video
2012-02-26T06:08:00.000Z	gogeta	bluezone	ati has never played nice with desktop effects
2012-02-26T06:09:00.000Z	gogeta	bluezone	try running compiz 2d see if the videos work
2012-02-26T06:09:00.000Z	gogeta	bluezone	sorry i ment unity 2d
2012-02-26T06:10:00.000Z	bluezone	gogeta	well right now i'm running gnome classic
2012-02-26T06:11:00.000Z	bluezone	gogeta	isn't it the same difference? i dont think there's any effects on classic
2012-02-26T06:11:00.000Z	gogeta	bluezone	ok then turn off desktop effects
2012-02-26T06:11:00.000Z	gogeta	bluezone	yea it has them
2012-02-26T06:12:00.000Z	bluezone	gogeta	such a shame because i have a high end video card xD
2012-02-26T06:12:00.000Z	gogeta	bluezone	the card works fine and will do high end stuf
2012-02-26T06:12:00.000Z	gogeta	bluezone	its just that firegl conflicts with unitys gl and slows things down
2012-02-26T06:13:00.000Z	gogeta	bluezone	at least the newer cards for some reasion
2012-02-26T06:17:00.000Z	bluezone	gogeta	okay i disaled all the effects in compiz but it's still very laggy with the tear free environment
2012-02-26T06:21:00.000Z	bluezone	gogeta	ello? xD
