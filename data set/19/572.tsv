2012-02-15T01:04:00.000Z	_Marcus		OerHerks: ukbot is here though
2012-02-15T01:04:00.000Z	_Marcus		Okay, I need to know, who here has successfully installed and started up the Ubuntu minimal iso?
2012-02-15T01:05:00.000Z	__Alex_	_Marcus	Me
2012-02-15T01:06:00.000Z	__Alex_	_Marcus	Strange, had no problems here. Seems that GUI-oriented OSs have a lot of problems with the bare basics
2012-03-12T23:29:00.000Z	__Alex_	_Marcus	shred -fvn1 /dev/hdX will do the same thing
2012-03-12T23:30:00.000Z	_Marcus	__Alex_	I may want to write something else besides /dev/urandom later on though.
2012-03-12T23:35:00.000Z	__Alex_	_Marcus	And also you'll have to make a new MBR
2012-03-12T23:35:00.000Z	_Marcus	__Alex_	What do you mean?
2012-03-12T23:38:00.000Z	__Alex_	_Marcus	/dev/sda1 is the Partition. /dev/sda is the disk bthe partition is located on.
2012-03-12T23:38:00.000Z	_Marcus	__Alex_	I want to write to the parition. It's 16GB and I want to fill that up with /dev/urandom
2012-03-12T23:40:00.000Z	__Alex_	_Marcus	here is your command then: "sudo dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/sda1"
2012-03-12T23:40:00.000Z	_Marcus	__Alex_	sda1 isn't the one I want to write to :x
2012-03-12T23:41:00.000Z	_Marcus	__Alex_	I know :P sda1 is my main partition
2012-03-12T23:41:00.000Z	__Alex_	_Marcus	Then where do you want to write?
2012-03-12T23:41:00.000Z	_Marcus	__Alex_	/dev/sdc1
2012-03-12T23:42:00.000Z	_Marcus	__Alex_	It's my flash drive.
2012-03-12T23:42:00.000Z	__Alex_	_Marcus	here is your command then: "sudo dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/sdc1"
2012-03-12T23:42:00.000Z	_Marcus	__Alex_	Thank you
2012-03-12T23:42:00.000Z	__Alex_	_Marcus	YW
