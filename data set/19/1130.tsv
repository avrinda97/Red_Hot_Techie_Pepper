2011-04-30T20:46:00.000Z	kkal	Guest68448	can you open it and see the contents?
2011-04-30T20:45:00.000Z	kkal	Guest68448	can you mount the mp4 player as a mass storage device?
2011-04-30T20:45:00.000Z	kkal	Guest68448	what do you mean by seeing the files but not the contents?
2011-04-30T20:46:00.000Z	Guest68448	kkal	is shows up on my desktop as a 7.8 GB Filesystem
2011-04-30T20:46:00.000Z	Guest68448	kkal	I see the folders but not the mp3/mp4/avi, or whatever
2011-04-30T20:47:00.000Z	Guest68448	kkal	I don't have this problem on Windoze so I suspect I am simply missing a file
2011-04-30T20:48:00.000Z	kkal	Guest68448	tried pasting the mp4 files directly into a folder on the mp4 player that looks like "music/audio" ?
2011-04-30T20:49:00.000Z	Guest68448	kkal	I had the same problem under a different distro. Help told me I was simply missing a file but I cannot even remember the name of it. It was something about compatibility or codecs or something
2011-04-30T20:50:00.000Z	Guest68448	kkal	the mp4 player's software is android
2011-04-30T20:54:00.000Z	kkal	Guest68448	you would be missing a package if you're talking about missing codecs. Although I dont see how missing a codec will prevent you from transfering files to the player
2011-04-30T20:54:00.000Z	Guest68448	kkal	could it be due to me missing ffmpeg?
2011-04-30T20:55:00.000Z	Guest68448	kkal	I'm just installing ffmpeg now
2011-04-30T20:58:00.000Z	Guest68448	kkal	it hasn't made a difference. I can see the files within the folders through Ubuntu but when I try to run them with the mp4 player is see only folders without content.
2011-04-30T21:06:00.000Z	Guest68448	kkal	there is some sort of file I must download through synaptic that let's my laptop communicate properly with my mp4 player. I am sorry I don't know the terminology.
2011-04-30T21:07:00.000Z	Guest68448	kkal	I've downloaded and solved the problem in the past, but I just cannot remember the name of it.
2011-04-30T21:14:00.000Z	kkal	Guest68448	gnokii?
2011-04-30T21:15:00.000Z	Guest68448	kkal	can't remember but I'll try it
2011-04-30T21:17:00.000Z	Guest68448	kkal	I'm not sure this is the right one but yes it is this sort of program
2011-04-30T21:24:00.000Z	Guest68448	kkal	no, that didn't work. However, in the mp4 player I could finally see the avi file. But, unfortunately I got the message it was an unsupported file. This has something to do with communication between Ubuntu and the mp4 player.
