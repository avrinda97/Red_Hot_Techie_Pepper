2008-11-09T00:05:00.000Z	jordo2323		When I open firefox now, it covers the Gnome panels at the top and bottom of the screen. I can hit F-11 to get it correct again, but does anyone know how to fix this?
2008-11-09T00:06:00.000Z	MnemonicPunk	jordo2323	I have the same problem sometimes (not always) but no idea what causes it. =( Tell me if you find a solution, please. xD
2008-11-09T00:07:00.000Z	jordo2323	MnemonicPunk	 Working on it....
2008-11-09T00:08:00.000Z	jordo2323	MnemonicPunk	I don't think it's because of Emerald themes,
2008-11-09T00:09:00.000Z	MnemonicPunk	jordo2323	Not sure, it looks like those bugs that emerald caused when it was new. But I have working window decorations programs when it happens.
2008-11-09T00:09:00.000Z	MnemonicPunk	jordo2323	Are you running AWN?
2008-11-09T00:10:00.000Z	jordo2323	MnemonicPunk	I was, but I went back to normal Gnome panels
2008-11-09T00:10:00.000Z	MnemonicPunk	jordo2323	Okay. So we can probably rule that out.
2008-11-09T00:11:00.000Z	jordo2323	MnemonicPunk	the weird thing is that only firefox does this....everything else seems fine
2008-11-09T00:11:00.000Z	MnemonicPunk	jordo2323	Yeh. Out of ideas. =(

2008-11-09T00:16:00.000Z	MnemonicPunk	jordo2323	Maybe we should just wait for it to get fixed. It's not nice but only a minor annoyance (at least for me since I start FF only 2-3 times a day)
2008-11-09T00:16:00.000Z	jordo2323	MnemonicPunk	I hear ya, but it sure is ANNOYING!
2008-11-09T00:17:00.000Z	MnemonicPunk	jordo2323	You could make some gconf workaround if you want to. Compiz has a setting that tells it what the resctrictions for window positions are. Edit that so it just can't pop under your top panel. =)
2008-11-09T00:19:00.000Z	jordo2323	MnemonicPunk	Unless it's an easier fix, I will wait like you :)  Not that I wouldn't attempt it, but that may cause another issue down the road
2008-11-09T00:19:00.000Z	MnemonicPunk	jordo2323	If you want to edit compiz settings, install the ccsm-simple package, then go to System -> Settings -> Appearance -> Visual effects -> Custom

2008-11-09T00:31:00.000Z	jordo2323	MnemonicPunk	 If you mark firefox 3.0 for complete removal, then reinstall it, it fixes the issue.  Remember to back up your bookmarks and stuff though...
