2007-01-19T10:57:00.000Z	eXistenZ		How can I keep a program running even after I close the terminal from which I run?
2007-01-19T10:58:00.000Z	Pici	eXistenZ	: you could also do nohup <command> & , that'll keep it from quitting when you close the terminal
2008-03-13T04:39:00.000Z	eXistenZ	Pici	is this new in 7.10?
2008-03-13T04:39:00.000Z	Pici	eXistenZ	I don't think so
2008-03-13T04:37:00.000Z	Pici	eXistenZ	apache2.conf
2008-03-13T04:37:00.000Z	eXistenZ	Pici	although I create public_html folder, it doesn't work
2008-03-13T04:38:00.000Z	Pici	eXistenZ	Did you enable and set UserDir?
2008-03-13T04:38:00.000Z	eXistenZ	Pici	is it disabled by default?
2008-03-13T04:38:00.000Z	Pici	eXistenZ	By default everything is served out of /var/www
2008-03-13T04:39:00.000Z	Pici	eXistenZ	If you want to set up per-user serving you need to do it yourself
2008-03-13T04:39:00.000Z	eXistenZ	Pici	in previous versions it wasn't this way
2008-03-13T04:40:00.000Z	Pici	eXistenZ	I don't remember how the previous versions were. :?
2008-03-13T04:41:00.000Z	eXistenZ	Pici	where do I set UserDir?
2008-03-13T04:41:00.000Z	Pici	eXistenZ	read: http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/howto/public_html.html  :)
2008-03-13T04:41:00.000Z	eXistenZ	Pici	thanks a million!
2008-03-13T04:41:00.000Z	Pici	eXistenZ	Explains it better than I can since I'm just reading it out of there anyway :p
2008-03-13T04:45:00.000Z	eXistenZ	Pici	How can it be that the base module is not included ? I get this error message :/ "Invalid command 'UserDir', perhaps misspelled or defined by a module not included in the server configuration httpd not running, trying to start"
2008-03-13T04:48:00.000Z	Pici	eXistenZ	Looks like you'll need to symlink the modules from /etc/apache2/mods-available/ into /etc/apache2/mods-available/ for the modules you want.  I think a2enmod userdir will do it automagically for you though.
2008-03-13T04:52:00.000Z	eXistenZ	Pici	I just got it, did you have it by default?
