2012-07-10T16:47:00.000Z	BluesKaj	T3X	run lshw to see if it's listed
2012-07-10T16:51:00.000Z	T3X	BluesKaj	yes it there
2012-07-10T16:54:00.000Z	BluesKaj	T3X	what about network manager , does it list another ethX
2012-07-10T16:54:00.000Z	T3X	BluesKaj	there is no destop interface for me i am running server edition
2012-07-10T17:00:00.000Z	BluesKaj	T3X	what does,  lspci | grep -i net , show
2012-07-10T17:01:00.000Z	T3X	BluesKaj	shows Two diffirent Ethernet controller one is intel and ather one is VIA.
2012-07-10T17:02:00.000Z	BluesKaj	T3X	what's the purpose of 2 NICs anyway ?
2012-07-10T17:03:00.000Z	T3X	BluesKaj	for setting it up as router and firewalle box
2012-07-10T17:03:00.000Z	T3X	BluesKaj	cant afford to buy $2000 Cisco Router to secure my network
2012-07-10T17:04:00.000Z	BluesKaj	T3X	how many machines on your network ?
2012-07-10T17:05:00.000Z	T3X	BluesKaj	between 20~50
2012-07-10T17:06:00.000Z	T3X	BluesKaj	ifconfig eth1 up, start showing data transmission but i think i need to add it in /etc/network/interfaces and configure it manualy right
2012-07-10T17:07:00.000Z	BluesKaj	T3X	yes have you set tthe infaces file up for static internal IP ?
2012-07-10T17:08:00.000Z	T3X	BluesKaj	will do now
2012-07-10T17:10:00.000Z	BluesKaj	T3X	dunno how this will apply to a large network, but here's a guide , http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/howto-ubuntu-linux-convert-dhcp-network-configuration-to-static-ip-configuration.html
2012-07-10T17:32:00.000Z	T3X	BluesKaj	it working like a charm, I just had to identify it in /etc/network/interfaces, after that execute ifconfig ethX up.
2012-07-10T17:32:00.000Z	BluesKaj	T3X	cool :)
