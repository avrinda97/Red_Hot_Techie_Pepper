2012-10-20T06:36:00.000Z	saby		I downloaded the Ubuntu 12.10 amd64 iso so that I can upgrade my 12.04 to 12.10, but the live cd hangs at boot "Stopping save kernel messages [Ok]"
2012-10-20T06:38:00.000Z	saby		Thanks DaemonicApathy , will check it
2012-10-20T06:40:00.000Z	saby		ubuntu-12.10-desktop-amd64.iso
2012-10-20T06:41:00.000Z	saby		so i'm basically at the start :P
2012-10-20T06:42:00.000Z	saby		I already have 12.04 and wanted to upgrade the OS, but since that would require atleast 2gb of download, so i got the live cd and will upgrade using that
2012-10-20T06:43:00.000Z	saby		wastrel tried with unetbootin and the usb disc creator in ubuntu
2012-10-20T06:43:00.000Z	saby		startup disk creator *
2012-10-20T06:44:00.000Z	xangua	saby	by upgrade you mean clean installÂ¿
2012-10-20T06:45:00.000Z	saby		wastrel yes it doesnt boot, hangs at "Stopping Save kernel messages [Ok]"
2012-10-20T06:45:00.000Z	saby	xangua	nopes, not a clean install
2012-10-20T06:45:00.000Z	saby		would want to upgrade
2012-10-20T06:45:00.000Z	saby		i've too much installed to do a clean install :P
2012-10-20T06:45:00.000Z	xangua	saby	then you just need the iso, there wasn't need to create a bootable usb
2012-10-20T06:46:00.000Z	saby	xangua	how can I do that ?
2012-10-20T06:46:00.000Z	xangua	saby	and anyways you'll have to still upgrade all the programs that are not in the cd, those 2gb for upgrade didn't create on their own ;)
2012-10-20T06:46:00.000Z	saby		hahahah xangua indeed, but i was able to save atleast 800mb by getting the iso from office lol :P
2012-10-20T06:47:00.000Z	saby		cos my net sucks big time
2012-10-20T06:48:00.000Z	saby	xangua	then how can I upgrade ?
2012-10-20T06:49:00.000Z	xangua	saby	you will not save nothing at the end, plenty of documetation since official to a lot of unoficial(blog) guides https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Upgrades#Upgrades_via_alternate_CD
