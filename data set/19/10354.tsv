2008-09-05T02:51:00.000Z	compengi	ray__	xmms is not developed anymore. it's old. you can use audacious, it's like xmms and winamp
2008-09-05T02:51:00.000Z	ray__	compengi	should i use xmm2 now
2008-09-05T02:52:00.000Z	ray__	compengi	should i get all xmm2 stuff
2008-09-05T02:52:00.000Z	compengi	ray__	as you wish. but the idea is it's already old and project is abandoned. audacious is always under developement and i *think* xmms isn't supported by hardy good
2008-09-05T02:53:00.000Z	ray__	compengi	understand but im asking about xmm
2008-09-05T02:53:00.000Z	ray__	compengi	i mean xmm2
2008-09-05T02:56:00.000Z	ray__	compengi	is xmm2 still going
2008-09-05T02:57:00.000Z	compengi	ray__	i never used it. i prefer personally audacious as i can find plugins and scripts for it
2008-09-05T02:57:00.000Z	compengi	ray__	and it's stylish
