2007-10-21T16:03:00.000Z	raidproblem		oh, looks like it just doesn't work
2007-10-21T16:04:00.000Z	saloxin	raidproblem	google says ich9r is badly supported under linux (it's software raid). use linux native software raid (md)?
2007-10-21T16:04:00.000Z	raidproblem	saloxin	Yup I think that is what I have to do. Of course now I have a full windows install on a striped volume that I have to trash :(
2007-10-21T16:05:00.000Z	raidproblem	saloxin	What I really wanted was to have windows striped for games, then linux mirrored
2007-10-21T16:05:00.000Z	raidproblem	saloxin	Not sure how I get windows to stripe unless the ICH9R is doing it, I'll have a look
2007-10-21T16:05:00.000Z	saloxin	raidproblem	get a proper raid controller
2007-10-21T16:06:00.000Z	raidproblem	saloxin	I guess. I wish there was a law that the stuff on motherboards couldn't be called RAID. Call it "FURAID" or something
2007-10-21T16:06:00.000Z	saloxin	raidproblem	yep, that would save the world for a lot of pain.
2007-10-21T16:07:00.000Z	raidproblem	saloxin	With a proper RAID card, would the volumes appear as disks to the standard installer?
2007-10-21T16:07:00.000Z	saloxin	raidproblem	yep. hwraid presents the finnished raiddevice as a normal scsi
2007-10-21T16:07:00.000Z	saloxin	raidproblem	unless you get a highend raidcard linux software raid will be just as fast
2007-10-21T16:08:00.000Z	raidproblem	saloxin	Yup, so I guess I can set up two partitions of the same size for windows, then use the rest of each disk for a SW raid under linux?
2007-10-21T16:08:00.000Z	saloxin	raidproblem	yep
2007-10-21T16:09:00.000Z	raidproblem	saloxin	Can I do the SW raid in the kubuntu installer easily, or does it require lots of typing?
2007-10-21T16:09:00.000Z	saloxin	raidproblem	you need the alternate cd for raid/lvm setups
2007-10-21T16:09:00.000Z	raidproblem	saloxin	Ah ok I have that already
2007-10-21T16:09:00.000Z	raidproblem	saloxin	thanks for the help, you seem to be very busy :)
2007-10-21T16:10:00.000Z	saloxin	raidproblem	im multitasking :-)
2007-10-21T16:10:00.000Z	raidproblem	saloxin	Okee dokee I'd better go hose my system again :) Thanks :)
