2007-04-28T07:09:00.000Z	flatfilm		can anyone link me to a decent xorg.conf howto?
2007-04-28T07:09:00.000Z	Pelo	flatfilm	 what do you need to know ?
2007-04-28T07:10:00.000Z	flatfilm	Pelo	when i change to a different tty using control-alt f1-6, my screen is shifted to the side a bit
2007-04-28T07:11:00.000Z	Pelo	flatfilm	I'm not sure you can correct that in xorg.conf
2007-04-28T07:11:00.000Z	flatfilm	Pelo	I think i can because i ripped out a few of the lower end resolutions to get gdm working properly
2007-04-28T07:12:00.000Z	Pelo	flatfilm	 you can restore the xorg.conf with   sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2007-04-28T07:13:00.000Z	flatfilm	Pelo	What depth does the a terminal screen run at?
2007-04-28T07:14:00.000Z	flatfilm	Pelo	I know my desktop runs at 24
2007-04-28T07:14:00.000Z	Pelo	flatfilm	not sure  640x480 probably
2007-04-28T07:14:00.000Z	flatfilm	Pelo	Sorry I meant depth not resolution
2007-04-28T07:14:00.000Z	Pelo	flatfilm	 sorry,  I miss read
2007-04-28T07:14:00.000Z	flatfilm	Pelo	I'm guessing one?
2007-04-28T07:14:00.000Z	Pelo	flatfilm	 would you like a copy of my xorg.conf so you can copy stuff over ?
2007-04-28T07:15:00.000Z	flatfilm	Pelo	no thanks i made a backup of mine
2007-04-28T07:15:00.000Z	flatfilm	Pelo	i just don't want to reconfigure xorg cause everything works great except this slight problem
2007-04-28T07:21:00.000Z	flatfilm	Pelo	think i fixed it by fiddling with the settings on my lcd menu
2007-04-28T07:21:00.000Z	Pelo	flatfilm	 I thought it was probably not xorg
2007-04-28T07:33:00.000Z	flatfilm	Pelo	thanks for your help. got my problem solved
2007-04-28T07:33:00.000Z	Pelo	flatfilm	I'm happy for you
