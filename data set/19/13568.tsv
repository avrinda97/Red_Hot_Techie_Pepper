2005-03-05T11:53:00.000Z	encryptio		kde 3.
2005-03-05T11:53:00.000Z	encryptio		3.3.2
2005-03-05T11:53:00.000Z	encryptio		here
2005-03-05T11:54:00.000Z	Pelle_	encryptio	got if from ubuntu archives?
2005-03-05T11:54:00.000Z	encryptio	Pelle_	nope, from debian unstable. gotta be really careful mixing distros, so be warned.
2005-03-05T11:55:00.000Z	Pelle_	encryptio	I thought of that - but does it work? mixing debian pkgs with ubuntu?
2005-03-05T11:55:00.000Z	encryptio	Pelle_	it does, but you have to know what you're doing. messing your system up a few times will help you learn that.
2005-03-05T11:56:00.000Z	Pelle_	encryptio	hmm... im considering switching to fedora 3 (comes with kde 3.3 preinstalled). but i like ubuntu. its more stable...
2005-03-05T11:57:00.000Z	encryptio	Pelle_	well, you have fun with the rpms. i'm staying away from fc for that reason only
2005-03-05T11:58:00.000Z	Pelle_	encryptio	yes, well. apt is one step ahead. cant compete with it.
2005-03-05T11:59:00.000Z	encryptio	Pelle_	you can compete with it. gentoo competes with it, and has some serious advantages -- plus the disadvantage of a >8hour install, not just looking at the screen.
2005-03-05T12:00:00.000Z	Pelle_	encryptio	have you ever used apt on an rpm system?
2005-03-05T12:00:00.000Z	encryptio	Pelle_	yes. i hated it.
2005-03-05T12:00:00.000Z	Pelle_	encryptio	it didn't work?
2005-03-05T12:01:00.000Z	encryptio	Pelle_	it was slow to load stuff -- i had to find out what i needed manually, get dependencies manuallt...
2005-03-05T12:01:00.000Z	encryptio	Pelle_	nonetheless, it did "work"
2005-03-05T12:02:00.000Z	Pelle_	encryptio	hmm... im really fond of kde. have you tried the new 3.4?
2005-03-05T12:02:00.000Z	encryptio	Pelle_	i'm in kde right now, and i like it. but, 3.4 is too on-the-edge for me.
2005-03-05T12:05:00.000Z	encryptio	Pelle_	i wouldn't be surprised if they did.
