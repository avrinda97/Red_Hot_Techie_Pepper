2006-08-20T10:45:00.000Z	bobovski		hi again, all
2006-08-20T10:45:00.000Z	bobovski		is there a way to apt-get a previous version of firefox?
2006-08-20T10:46:00.000Z	jrib	bobovski	how come? is the current version broken in some way?
2006-08-20T10:47:00.000Z	bobovski	jrib	well, I think so. I'm having problems with flashplayer hanging. Only in firefox, in opera it's fine. I've tried pretty much everything I've come across as a fix. Before the update a few weeks ago, of firefox that is, it all worked fine
2006-08-20T10:47:00.000Z	bobovski	jrib	now firefox hangs randomly when I leave a page with flash content
2006-08-20T10:48:00.000Z	jrib	bobovski	apt-cache policy firefox, can tell you available versions
2006-08-20T10:48:00.000Z	bobovski	jrib	ok, so let me askl a question about apt-get
2006-08-20T10:49:00.000Z	bobovski	jrib	when I apt-get install firefox
2006-08-20T10:49:00.000Z	bobovski	jrib	that just installs the newest version listed here, 1.2.dfsg+1.5.0.5-0ubuntu6.06.1 right?
2006-08-20T10:50:00.000Z	jrib	bobovski	yes, you can do 'sudo apt-get install firefox=VERSION' though
2006-08-20T10:50:00.000Z	bobovski	jrib	ok, from the version table, how do I tell which version to type in?
2006-08-20T10:51:00.000Z	jrib	bobovski	yes, but beware these new versions are basically security fixes so you will be running an exploitable firefox
2006-08-20T10:51:00.000Z	jrib	bobovski	also I don't know how well a downgrade of firefox will work
2006-08-20T10:53:00.000Z	bobovski	jrib	well, it's worth a shot just to see if it's a version specific problem with firefox, right?
2006-08-20T10:53:00.000Z	jrib	bobovski	you can try.  But to let you know, flash has always done that to me in firefox on linux.  I am fairly certain it's flash's fault, not firefox's
2006-08-20T10:53:00.000Z	bobovski	jrib	well, I can't even get the firefox-=VERSION thing to work right, so whatever :)
2006-08-20T10:54:00.000Z	bobovski	jrib	ah, that's good information to have. You don't know a workaround?
2006-08-20T10:55:00.000Z	bobovski	jrib	I thought at first it was a sound issue, but that doesn't seem to be the case
2006-08-20T10:56:00.000Z	bobovski	jrib	thanks for the help!
