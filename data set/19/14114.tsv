2006-10-14T05:30:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Nothing_about	I can recommend a good shrink ;-)
2006-10-14T05:31:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Nothing_about	you can get ready-made vmware Ubuntu from their website, I believe
2006-10-16T16:04:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Nothing_about	try saying what you want to install
2006-10-16T16:04:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Nothing_about	not your root pass unless you set one
2006-10-16T16:05:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Nothing_about	ubuntu uses sudo
2006-10-16T16:05:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Nothing_about	no, it wants your USER pass
2006-10-16T16:07:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Nothing_about	 sudo <command here>
2006-10-16T16:08:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Nothing_about	in most distros it defaults to root as the user to switch to - in ubuntu you use sudo <command>
2006-10-16T16:09:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Nothing_about	read the link about root and sudo
2006-10-16T16:10:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Nothing_about	try asking in #vmware perhaps
2006-10-16T16:11:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Nothing_about	currently 61 people there ....
