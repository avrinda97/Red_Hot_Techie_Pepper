2006-01-08T13:02:00.000Z	hippo		hi everyone... i have an ubuntu setup on a box that i want to turn into a web hosting server. can anyone point me in the direction of setting that up professionally and securely? i am a total linux noob :(
2006-01-08T13:02:00.000Z	hippo		feel free to pm me if you would like
2006-01-08T13:02:00.000Z	hippo		ty
2006-01-08T13:03:00.000Z	polpak	hippo	I'd suggest either becoming less of a linux noob, or hiring someone who knows more about it before trying to set up a professional server.. It's better left to the professionals ;p
2006-01-08T13:03:00.000Z	polpak	hippo	not to say you shouldn't try
2006-01-08T13:03:00.000Z	hippo		well its not like that exactly...
2006-01-08T13:03:00.000Z	hippo		im a senior designer at a company who uses windows nt hosting
2006-01-08T13:04:00.000Z	hippo		and i complain to them regularly that every linux hosting ive seen is better, more open source software etc...
2006-01-08T13:04:00.000Z	polpak	hippo	but administrating web servers (and the security issues therein) isn't an easy job for someone just starting out
2006-01-08T13:04:00.000Z	hippo		so we are doing a trial linux box for my personal website
2006-01-08T13:04:00.000Z	hippo		its not like im about to start a professional linux hosting company... but i do want to host my site on our lines and ips, but on ubuntu
2006-01-08T13:04:00.000Z	hippo		yes.
2006-01-08T13:04:00.000Z	hippo		we run about 200 sites
2006-01-08T13:05:00.000Z	hippo		all. nt4
2006-01-08T13:05:00.000Z	polpak	hippo	I'd still suggest hiring someone to help you get started
2006-01-08T13:06:00.000Z	hippo		not really scoota
2006-01-08T13:06:00.000Z	hippo		so seveas... just go straight to apache?
2006-01-08T13:06:00.000Z	hippo	sas171	which wikki, ubuntu?
2006-01-08T13:06:00.000Z	polpak	hippo	you'll need apache, and either a ftp or sftp daemon at a minimum
