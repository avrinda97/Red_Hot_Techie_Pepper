2010-01-24T13:21:00.000Z	PacketCollision		Does anyone have any ideas on how to completely disable graphical terminal in 9.10? The server I'm working on just shows a blank screen when it boots up (ubuntu-server netboot install).
2010-01-24T13:22:00.000Z	PacketCollision		I edited /etc/default/grub and enabled GRUB_TERMINAL=console
2010-01-24T13:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	PacketCollision	 disabel the gdm service.  if it exists..   but you are using the server edition?
2010-01-24T13:23:00.000Z	PacketCollision	Dr_Willis	gdm isn't installed
2010-01-24T13:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	PacketCollision	 thats odd then.
2010-01-24T13:25:00.000Z	PacketCollision	Dr_Willis	I disabled "quiet" in grub, and it shows the stuff that quiet hides at the start of the boot process, but then the screen goes blank, even with recovery mode
2010-01-24T13:25:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	PacketCollision	 perhaps use verbose, and nosplash, and nofb as options...
2010-01-24T13:26:00.000Z	PacketCollision	Dr_Willis	good idea with nofb
2010-01-24T13:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	PacketCollision	 im not even sure if fb is the default any more
2010-01-24T13:35:00.000Z	PacketCollision	Dr_Willis	none of those options worked, but I know that the last thing that shows up is fsck, then a flash of what I think is setting console fonts
2010-01-24T13:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	PacketCollision	 what video card is in that thing?
2010-01-24T13:47:00.000Z	PacketCollision	Dr_Willis	Intel Corporation Pineview Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 02
2010-01-24T13:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	PacketCollision	 Hmm. other then nofb, nosplash, noquiet, verbose, im out of ideas... and disable gdm of course. but theres no gdm on a server install
2010-01-24T13:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	PacketCollision	 can you still ssh into the server?
2010-01-24T13:54:00.000Z	PacketCollision	Dr_Willis	yes, ssh works fine
2010-01-24T13:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	PacketCollision	 check what modules are loading..  (just a guess)
2010-01-24T13:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	PacketCollision	 also try commenting that line you uncomented perhaps?
2010-01-24T14:19:00.000Z	PacketCollision	Dr_Willis	SmartSsa ardchoille: adding "blacklist i915" to /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf is enough to fix the blank screen problem
2010-01-24T14:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	PacketCollision	 so my 'module' suggestion helped? :)
