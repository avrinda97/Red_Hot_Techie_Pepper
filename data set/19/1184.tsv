2012-03-23T07:20:00.000Z	sacarlson	gdea73	if I recall skype did some auto volume setting so I wonder if it changed some volume setting you don't see?
2012-03-23T07:21:00.000Z	gdea73	sacarlson	That's what I'm guessing. I wonder how I can reset ALL audio settings to the defaults. The defaults worked great for me before.
2012-03-23T07:24:00.000Z	sacarlson	gdea73	I look at my sound on UB 11.10 and I don't see any mixer settings so maybe you need a mixer installed to even see all the settings
2012-03-23T07:24:00.000Z	gdea73	sacarlson	well that's true... but ... what do I install? alsamixergui doesn't do much apparently
2012-03-23T07:25:00.000Z	sacarlson	gdea73	I'm not sure I just installed this version, my 10.04 had one but forget name
2012-03-23T07:33:00.000Z	sacarlson	gdea73	I just installed gnome alsa mixer, just so I have one, it seems to have settings I've never even seen before like headphone enable
2012-03-23T07:33:00.000Z	gdea73	sacarlson	I will try that one, thanks.
2012-03-23T07:33:00.000Z	gdea73	sacarlson	what worries me is that the mic works for a second, and then when accessed by an application, it fails.
2012-03-23T07:34:00.000Z	sacarlson	gdea73	oh that doesn't sound like a mixer thing then, i'm not sure
2012-03-23T08:00:00.000Z	sacarlson	gdea73	the record part is the capture settings
2012-03-23T08:01:00.000Z	gdea73	sacarlson	but Rec. is checked already, and it didn't seem to do anything
2012-03-23T08:01:00.000Z	sacarlson	gdea73	oh there is another setting for mic boost on some sound cards
2012-03-23T08:02:00.000Z	gdea73	sacarlson	yeah I saw that. The problem though isn't the volume, it's that I can't actually USE the mic in anything
2012-03-23T08:03:00.000Z	sacarlson	gdea73	without mic boost on my mike I don't hear anything,  but ya you said it works in feed back so that can't be it eather
2012-03-23T08:03:00.000Z	gdea73	sacarlson	well and it's not the boost, it's that it's literally unrecognized as a recording device after a second
2012-03-23T08:05:00.000Z	sacarlson	gdea73	might want to take a peak at what your audio card is with sudo lspci  and see if any others are having problems with it, if you didn't check that already
2012-03-23T08:06:00.000Z	gdea73	sacarlson	I'm not sure, I think it's an unnamed ATI, i.e. Device 17xx, and the problem is that it *worked* before - Skype changed some stupid setting somewhere and now it doesn't.
2012-03-23T08:06:00.000Z	sacarlson	gdea73	take a closer look at sudo lspci and google with added skype in search
2012-03-23T08:07:00.000Z	gdea73	sacarlson	I've got nothing else to do, but sleep, so I'll give it a shot.
