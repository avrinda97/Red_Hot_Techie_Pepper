2006-03-30T11:17:00.000Z	blueOrange		ok REAL basic question here . . . i found a program that says it should enable my svideo out port.  i have navigated to the directory and i understand i need to do a "make install" which file should i do it on ?
2006-03-30T11:18:00.000Z	NigelS	blueOrange	just type the command in the directory; make looks for a Makefile you don;'t need to type anything else
2006-03-30T11:20:00.000Z	blueOrange	NigelS	thxs. i tried "sudo make install" and i got back "sudo: make: command not found" .
2006-03-30T11:20:00.000Z	blueOrange	NigelS	but i do see a "makefile" in this directory.
2006-03-30T11:20:00.000Z	NigelS	blueOrange	install the make program with sudo apt-get install make
2006-03-30T11:22:00.000Z	blueOrange	NigelS	ok great, that helps, thxs.
2006-03-30T11:25:00.000Z	blueOrange	NigelS	is there something else i need to do to install the code? it does seem to have worked i got "setting up make"
2006-03-30T11:27:00.000Z	NigelS	blueOrange	a "normal" series of instructions to build a program would be to run a configure script with ./configure from the same dir ( that's not essential but quite useful for some projects so they include one) then to run "make" just on its own.  Then optionally to install the compiled binaries into the system tree with make install
2006-03-30T11:29:00.000Z	NigelS	blueOrange	but in any event read the "INSTALL" file which is usually in the root dir of the source code by convention and that should tell you what steps it needs; also there might be specific make "targets" for this program
2006-03-30T11:32:00.000Z	blueOrange	NigelS	thxs, i know this stuff is basic, but i am just figuring it out. ok so i hadnt done the config thing, there is no install file, just a readme.  it looks to me like the last step is "make install" but i still dont seem to have the command at my disposal.
2006-03-30T11:37:00.000Z	NigelS	blueOrange	when you say the make install command is not at your disposal - how so? with make installed now, there should be an "install" target inside the makefile which tells it where to put stuff; have you followed the steps before then though?
2006-03-30T11:38:00.000Z	blueOrange	NigelS	i thought i went through all the steps but when i call the pgram, it says that command is not available.
2006-03-30T11:40:00.000Z	NigelS	blueOrange	ok, are you sure that there wasn't an error along the way? what were the steps you took and what output did you get?
2006-03-30T11:42:00.000Z	blueOrange	NigelS	I did: "sudo apt-get install make" resulted in: "
2006-03-30T11:44:00.000Z	blueOrange	NigelS	I did: "sudo apt-get install make" resulted in: "reading packages lists...done    building dependency tree . .. done new packages insatlled: make" . . . . . "setting up make"
2006-03-30T11:44:00.000Z	NigelS	blueOrange	ok, so you installed make - what next?
2006-03-30T11:45:00.000Z	blueOrange	NigelS	makeinstall ?
2006-03-30T11:46:00.000Z	NigelS	blueOrange	two separate words "make install" but quite often there's more to be done first; often "make" on its own
2006-03-30T11:46:00.000Z	blueOrange	NigelS	ps i never did a .configure as that file is not listed in the directory.
