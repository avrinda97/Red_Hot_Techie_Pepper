2006-06-22T16:23:00.000Z	maxkelley		I tried doing the same the other day, but then again, I didn't mess around too much.
2006-06-22T16:23:00.000Z	maxkelley		not in the channel, though! Flippy!
2006-06-22T16:23:00.000Z	Warbo	maxkelley	lol

2006-06-22T16:31:00.000Z	Warbo	maxkelley	Better than min: _______________________________________________
2006-06-22T16:31:00.000Z	maxkelley	Warbo	you didn't have to paste it, we all know ;)
2006-06-22T16:34:00.000Z	maxkelley	Warbo	precisely.
2006-06-22T05:14:00.000Z	Warbo	maxkelley	You just asked to as to ask a question. That's not allowed
2006-06-22T05:19:00.000Z	maxkelley	Warbo	know the wikidoc about dual-booting? my internet connection is a bit slow.
2006-06-22T05:20:00.000Z	Warbo	maxkelley	Nope, but I think I have the Wiki open on one of my desktops........
2006-06-22T05:20:00.000Z	maxkelley	Warbo	ah, nvm.. it was about his dual-booting problem
2006-06-22T05:21:00.000Z	Warbo	maxkelley	Hmmm. The "Community Docs" page on Installation has a dual-booting link, but the page doesn't exist (yet)
2006-06-22T05:36:00.000Z	maxkelley	Warbo	no-no, automagically :)
2006-06-22T05:37:00.000Z	Warbo	maxkelley	I would say "automagically" if it detected that you wanted it, then installed it. Automatic hasn't got groovy detection stuff (that's how I see it anyway)
2006-06-22T05:37:00.000Z	maxkelley	Warbo	o
2006-10-22T11:57:00.000Z	Warbo	maxkelley	Try Application>Accessories>Character Map
2006-10-22T11:57:00.000Z	maxkelley	Warbo	is there a keyboard shortcut?
2006-10-22T11:57:00.000Z	Warbo	maxkelley	No idea, sorry
