2010-08-13T05:42:00.000Z	_DGM_		i dont see a package named ubuntutweek
2010-08-13T05:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	_DGM_	 go to the Ubuntu tweak homepage and download  tghe .deb
2010-08-13T05:43:00.000Z	_DGM_	Dr_Willis	i know :P sm3gal is asking for it, not me
2010-08-21T07:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	_DGM_	 thats the Me Menu I think. :)
2010-08-21T07:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	_DGM_	 are you using the NETBOOK interface?
2010-08-21T07:59:00.000Z	_DGM_	Dr_Willis	ye
2010-08-21T08:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	_DGM_	 then you need to basically make a 'gnome desktop' session that clones the netbook interface. then you can customize it. the Netbook interface is locked down for some odd reason.
2010-08-21T08:00:00.000Z	_DGM_	Dr_Willis	the option to remove wasnt there on my desktop either though i checked
2010-08-21T08:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	_DGM_	 its here on my Desktop version..  i just looked
2010-08-21T08:02:00.000Z	_DGM_	Dr_Willis	hmm strange. either way thanks for the link :) i'll give that a go
2010-08-21T08:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	_DGM_	 i found the kde netbook intface better in a great many ways.
2010-08-21T08:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	_DGM_	 but with 10.10 theres that new Unity Interface.
2010-08-21T08:10:00.000Z	_DGM_	Dr_Willis	it unlocked my bar but if i remove it it also removes the shutdown button :P oh well
2010-08-21T08:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	_DGM_	 my new one does also. Not tried it yet.
2010-08-21T08:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	_DGM_	 not really
2010-10-16T19:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	_DGM_	  the /dev/sdXX entries are not fixed. They can move around depending on whats plugged in on boot time.
2010-10-16T19:02:00.000Z	_DGM_	Dr_Willis	but nothing changed. Its a server :P and the annoying part is, now my kvm's wont boot because it cant find /dev/sdd xD
2010-10-16T19:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	_DGM_	 fstab entries should be using the UUID's
2010-10-16T19:03:00.000Z	_DGM_	Dr_Willis	i know. But the kvm storages dont ;)
