2011-03-25T18:31:00.000Z	soreau	psymin	why do you ask?
2011-03-25T18:32:00.000Z	psymin	soreau	I'm in the market for a new laptop and I'm hearing bad things about this onboard Intel video not playing nice with the binary drivers.  Machines with really good video cards getting stuck using the Intel video.
2011-03-25T18:32:00.000Z	soreau	psymin	Your best bet would be radeon since they have very good open drivers
2011-03-25T18:32:00.000Z	psymin	soreau	the open drivers are an option, but they don't compare to the binary ones
2011-03-25T18:33:00.000Z	soreau	psymin	Yes, they do ;)

2011-03-25T18:35:00.000Z	soreau	psymin	I couldn't care less what phoronix has to say
2011-03-25T18:36:00.000Z	soreau	psymin	I am telling you though, radeon is the better bet because it has full support from AMD, including hw specs and paid devs to work full time on the open driver
2011-03-25T18:37:00.000Z	soreau	psymin	nvidia on the other hand, does not release any hw specs and refuses to cooperate with FOSS community
2011-03-25T18:38:00.000Z	soreau	psymin	I don't understand why you are asking about a 'gpu driver'/'cpu' combo. That doesn't seem to make sense
2011-03-25T18:40:00.000Z	soreau	psymin	Ohhh, you mean a switchable gpu mobo?
2011-03-25T18:40:00.000Z	soreau	psymin	The open drivers have support for it. Try asking in #radeon
2011-03-25T18:40:00.000Z	soreau	psymin	Think it's called switcheroo
2011-03-25T18:41:00.000Z	psymin	soreau	IMO the open drivers aren't 'good' enough :) .. but I'll do more research
2011-03-25T18:42:00.000Z	soreau	psymin	Here on my lowly rv350, after monitoring the progression for r300g (the gallium driver) and now gallium is faster and better than fglrx ever was, before it dropped support for these older cards
2011-03-25T18:43:00.000Z	soreau	psymin	Over the course of several years I have monitored the development and I am telling you, the open driver situation will continue to improve drastically
2011-03-25T18:44:00.000Z	soreau	psymin	It is. Ask in #radeon
2011-03-25T18:44:00.000Z	psymin	soreau	what type of FPS do you get with the open driver?
