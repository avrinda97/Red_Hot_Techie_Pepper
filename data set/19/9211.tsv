2007-01-04T08:04:00.000Z	aeromix		hi.. I am trying to download this file via wget  http://scripts.xchat.centrum.cz/scripts/online_txt.php?nick=SexyLeon
2007-01-04T08:04:00.000Z	adaptr	aeromix	it says "0"
2007-01-04T08:05:00.000Z	aeromix	adaptr	when I download it via wget, I get a void file, there is no zero
2007-01-04T08:06:00.000Z	adaptr	aeromix	works for me
2007-01-04T08:07:00.000Z	aeromix	adaptr	how did you download that page? with firefox?
2007-01-04T08:07:00.000Z	adaptr	aeromix	and wget
2007-01-04T08:08:00.000Z	aeromix	adaptr	just wget and no paramters?
2007-01-04T08:08:00.000Z	aeromix	adaptr	when I do cat that_downloaded_page I always can't see anything
2007-01-04T08:09:00.000Z	adaptr	aeromix	that's because you're not looking straight - the file has no LF at the end, so the 0 gets put at the start of your next porompt
2007-01-04T08:09:00.000Z	aeromix	adaptr	aha... so I need to modify the file first?
2007-01-04T08:10:00.000Z	adaptr	aeromix	I would think so.. being able to download a "0" is.... limited in functionality, I would say
2007-01-04T08:10:00.000Z	aeromix	adaptr	echo "\EOF">> file ? sth like that?
2007-01-04T08:10:00.000Z	adaptr	aeromix	whatever, why don't you make things easier on yourself and put something in there that will show up easily ?
2007-01-04T08:11:00.000Z	adaptr	aeromix	echo will normally insert a LF at the end, so you already did something non-standard to it
2007-01-04T08:11:00.000Z	aeromix	adaptr	ok, so just echo ""
2007-01-04T08:12:00.000Z	adaptr	aeromix	no, of course not - how about "echo TEST > file" ?
2007-01-04T08:12:00.000Z	aeromix	adaptr	you mean with >> ?
2007-01-04T08:12:00.000Z	adaptr	aeromix	no
2007-01-04T08:13:00.000Z	aeromix	adaptr	anyway, it works for me.. thank you
