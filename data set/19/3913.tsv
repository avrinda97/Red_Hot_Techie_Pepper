2012-10-03T23:31:00.000Z	ner0x		Working on a terrible old ubuntu computer ( I believe ). How can I confirm and then upgrade the system?
2012-10-03T23:33:00.000Z	ner0x		ssh? linux to linux?
2012-10-03T23:35:00.000Z	ner0x		Lot of newbs in here today. :-)
2012-10-03T23:36:00.000Z	webjocky	ner0x	I represent that remark!
2012-10-03T23:37:00.000Z	ner0x	webjocky	You are entitled to your opinion. :-)
2012-10-03T23:38:00.000Z	webjocky	ner0x	I'd hope so. The internets that I come from are kinda free in that regard.
2012-10-03T23:38:00.000Z	ner0x	webjocky	There are different internets!?
2012-10-03T23:38:00.000Z	webjocky	ner0x	haven't you hears? China has their own, Iran is starting their own... so yes! :P
2012-10-03T23:39:00.000Z	ner0x	webjocky	Fair enough. Guess it depends on your definition. lol
2012-10-03T23:40:00.000Z	webjocky	ner0x	as would anything else?
2012-10-03T23:40:00.000Z	ner0x	webjocky	Are you always this combative? lol
2012-10-03T23:41:00.000Z	webjocky	ner0x	heh, sorry to come across that way. I'm just stongly opinionated & got too much sleep last night :)
2012-10-03T23:42:00.000Z	ner0x	webjocky	No worries. I always get hate for the newb comments. lol
2012-10-03T23:43:00.000Z	webjocky	ner0x	newb comments make me feel welcome - especially when they come AFTER help :P
2012-10-03T23:44:00.000Z	ner0x	webjocky	We were all newbs at one time.
2012-10-03T23:45:00.000Z	ner0x	webjocky	Consider yourself lucky, when I started I had a dial-up connection.
2012-10-03T23:46:00.000Z	webjocky	ner0x	yeah, I guess the only guy that was never a Linux n00b is Linus Torvalds...
2012-10-03T23:46:00.000Z	ner0x	webjocky	Of course he was. When he started writing it. :-)
2012-10-03T23:56:00.000Z	webjocky	ner0x	are you always this combative?
