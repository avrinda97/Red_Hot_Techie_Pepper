2008-01-25T12:48:00.000Z	YALex		sudo chroot /media/root
2008-01-25T12:48:00.000Z	YALex		i've tried chroot /media/root /bin/bash too
2008-01-25T12:49:00.000Z	YALex		I've mounted and everything else
2008-01-25T12:49:00.000Z	YALex		which ones?
2008-01-25T12:49:00.000Z	YALex		yeah the shell
2008-01-25T12:49:00.000Z	YALex		i realise
2008-01-25T12:49:00.000Z	YALex		i was reading the forums and they suggested the second command
2008-01-25T12:50:00.000Z	YALex		chroot /media/root doesn't work
2008-01-25T12:50:00.000Z	travisat	YALex	why are you trying to chroot
2008-01-25T12:50:00.000Z	travisat	YALex	normally you don't have to chroot
2008-01-25T12:51:00.000Z	travisat	YALex	well what did you do to the partitions so it won't boot
2008-01-25T12:54:00.000Z	travisat	YALex	hmm ok, so you can get to grub?
2008-01-25T12:55:00.000Z	travisat	YALex	have you started the kernel with quiet and splash off so you can see where it fails?
2008-01-25T12:59:00.000Z	travisat	YALex	not good
2008-01-25T13:01:00.000Z	travisat	YALex	nvm meant /bin/bash
2008-01-25T13:03:00.000Z	travisat	YALex	sry im a little confused I don't see how adding a new partition could kill /sbin/init but not /bin/bash unless you have /bin and /sbin on different partitions
2008-01-25T13:03:00.000Z	travisat	YALex	my suggestion would be to save your home directory and reinstall
2008-01-25T13:05:00.000Z	travisat	YALex	I am sure you can fix it, but I think the effort outweighs reinstalling unless you have a bunch of custom compiled programs or the kernel
2008-01-25T13:05:00.000Z	travisat	YALex	I just don't know how or don't have enough info
