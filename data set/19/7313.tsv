2008-01-15T22:43:00.000Z	Ongaku		ok, odd, I haven´t had this thing on for a day and it says something is wrong with my gnome-settings-daemon....
2008-01-15T22:45:00.000Z	Ongaku		Unable to start the Gnome settings manager ¨gnome-settings-daemon"
2008-01-15T22:46:00.000Z	Ongaku		everything works except my windows colours and fonts are default... ?? lol
2008-01-15T22:48:00.000Z	Ongaku		Unable to start the settings manager 'gnome-settings-daemon'.
2008-01-15T22:48:00.000Z	Ongaku		Without the GNOME settings manager running, some preferences may not take effect. This could indicate a problem with Bonobo, or a non-GNOME (e.g. KDE) settings manager may already be active and conflicting with the GNOME settings manager.
2008-01-15T22:49:00.000Z	Ongaku		I don´t have KDE installed so I don´t know wth is going on
2008-01-15T22:50:00.000Z	Juhaz	Ongaku	try running /usr/lib/gnome-control-center/gnome-settings-daemon from terminal and see if you get any error messages there
2008-01-15T22:51:00.000Z	Ongaku		ok Juhaz
2008-01-15T22:51:00.000Z	Ongaku	Juhaz	LOL wow...i ran it and my theme came back...it must have not started up when i booted I guess
2008-01-15T22:52:00.000Z	Ongaku		juhaz: it has some errors but it fixed itself i guess
2008-01-15T22:53:00.000Z	Juhaz		perhaps, unless it won't ever start on login, but hard to say about that.
2008-01-15T22:53:00.000Z	Ongaku		juhaz: first time I
2008-01-15T22:53:00.000Z	Ongaku		have had this problem

2008-01-15T22:56:00.000Z	Ongaku		juhaz: oh and if i take off the terminal it goes back to default....
