2011-11-29T07:52:00.000Z	Jordan_U	_Neytiri_	Are you still having problems booting?
2011-11-29T07:57:00.000Z	Jordan_U	_Neytiri_	If you can pastebin the RESULTS.txt from boot info script I can probably tell you what's going wrong.
2011-11-29T08:03:00.000Z	Jordan_U	_Neytiri_	Did you manually select where grub should be installed to in the Ubuntu installer?
2011-11-29T08:04:00.000Z	_Neytiri_	Jordan_U	the first time no, the second time yes, and every time afterwoerd
2011-11-29T08:05:00.000Z	Jordan_U	_Neytiri_	Where did you tell the installer to install grub's boot sector to?
2011-11-29T08:05:00.000Z	_Neytiri_	Jordan_U	Executing 'grub-install /dev/sda' failed.   this is a fatal error.          i didnt select /dev/sda
2011-11-29T08:06:00.000Z	_Neytiri_	Jordan_U	i told it to insall on /dev/sdh
2011-11-29T08:09:00.000Z	Jordan_U	_Neytiri_	How did you check what drive sdh corrosponds to, and what your BIOS calls that drive?
2011-11-29T08:10:00.000Z	_Neytiri_	Jordan_U	sdh was a flash card
2011-11-29T08:11:00.000Z	Jordan_U	_Neytiri_	How did you check that sdh was a flash card? Are you sure that you set your BIOS to boot from that same flash card?
2011-11-29T08:14:00.000Z	Jordan_U	_Neytiri_	You selected "sdh" and not "sdh1" as the device to install grub's boot sector to?
2011-11-29T08:15:00.000Z	Jordan_U	_Neytiri_	Boot info script output would be very enlightening if you can find a way to get it.
2011-11-29T08:20:00.000Z	_Neytiri_	Jordan_U	as soon as i remake my usb boot drive i will boot into the live demo again and run the dang boot script

2011-11-30T11:01:00.000Z	Jordan_U	_Neytiri_	You should also mention that you're using FakeRAID.
2011-11-30T11:03:00.000Z	_Neytiri_	Jordan_U	my bios gave me the option to use SATA-mode RAID-mode or AHCI-mode
