2006-12-16T13:02:00.000Z	osah		do you recommend any website learning some basics like i have no clue what grep does... :)
2006-12-16T13:02:00.000Z	osah		its my first time on linux.. been on windows since win95
2006-12-16T13:03:00.000Z	osah		i was wondering, when i run an application from console for example  "xchat" if i close console xchat closes. I know there is a command to make it run but i still can type other commands in console..
2006-12-16T13:04:00.000Z	Born_In_Xixax	osah	you may find it nice to use 'Alt+F2' to open a 'run' command window and issue it there
2006-12-16T13:04:00.000Z	osah		yup that was it  & sign :D
