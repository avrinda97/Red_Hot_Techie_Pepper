2009-11-21T14:13:00.000Z	seanj		Ubuntu recognizes my sound card, but the input doesn't work. I need it to work :|
2009-11-21T14:14:00.000Z	tenmuzni9	seanj	the input as in microphone?
2009-11-21T14:14:00.000Z	seanj	tenmuzni9	yes... it has a combination line-in/mic... neither function works
2009-11-21T14:15:00.000Z	tenmuzni9	seanj	are you sure that you are using the correct mixerI?
2009-11-21T14:15:00.000Z	seanj	tenmuzni9	the sound preferences say it's a SB X-Fi, with "1 Output/1 Input"
2009-11-21T14:16:00.000Z	seanj	tenmuzni9	I messed with the volume sliders and there is no sound.
2009-11-21T14:16:00.000Z	tenmuzni9	seanj	ugh x-fi are trouble. If your using gnome open up a terminal and type gnome-volume-control
2009-11-21T14:16:00.000Z	seanj	tenmuzni9	no sound.
2009-11-21T14:17:00.000Z	tenmuzni9	seanj	you should see a list of devices at the top, one of them probably says "such and such - capture"
2009-11-21T14:17:00.000Z	seanj	tenmuzni9	You mean under "Input" tab?
2009-11-21T14:18:00.000Z	tenmuzni9	seanj	no, there should be "Devices:" and a list of devices you can choose from
2009-11-21T14:18:00.000Z	seanj	tenmuzni9	there is only one device... "SB X-Fi"
2009-11-21T14:20:00.000Z	tenmuzni9	seanj	a long while ago I had to compile a more recent versino of alsa to get my creative card to work
2009-11-21T14:21:00.000Z	seanj	tenmuzni9	How do I get alsa?
2009-11-21T14:21:00.000Z	tenmuzni9	seanj	you should already have it, but you can google for the latest version
2009-11-21T14:23:00.000Z	seanj	tenmuzni9	there's like 8 different programs here, including "alsa-driver", "alsa-lib" .. do I need them all?
2009-11-21T14:24:00.000Z	tenmuzni9	seanj	I haven't compiled alsa in a while, im sure that there is a guide though, google compile alsa from source ubuntu
2009-11-21T14:25:00.000Z	tenmuzni9	seanj	i would try googling your specific sound card + ubuntu too
2009-11-21T14:45:00.000Z	tenmuzni9	seanj	ive ran into all kinsd of problems like that with creative cards, random settings in random places
