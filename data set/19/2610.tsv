2010-02-22T03:33:00.000Z	Sledge	Red_HamsterX	 yes
2010-02-22T03:25:00.000Z	Red_HamsterX	Sledge	what are you trying to change about it?
2010-02-22T03:25:00.000Z	Sledge	Red_HamsterX	 the way it appears
2010-02-22T03:26:00.000Z	Sledge	Red_HamsterX	 trying to make it look more like MAC OSX
2010-02-22T03:26:00.000Z	Sledge	Red_HamsterX	 i loaded up a theme called Mac4l
2010-02-22T03:27:00.000Z	Red_HamsterX	Sledge	do you mean the OS X bar or the dock?
2010-02-22T03:27:00.000Z	Sledge	Red_HamsterX	 uhm.. the part that holds all the icons, and moves n stuff
2010-02-22T03:28:00.000Z	Sledge	Red_HamsterX	 i want that instead of what it looks like now.
2010-02-22T03:28:00.000Z	Red_HamsterX	Sledge	do you have an OS X system yourself or are you going based on what eyecandy you've seen demonstrated in stores?
2010-02-22T03:29:00.000Z	Red_HamsterX	Sledge	while I can say that the dock is pretty intuitively designed, it does take some getting used to.
2010-02-22T03:30:00.000Z	Red_HamsterX	Sledge	are you talking about the thing that's usually at the bottom of the screen, with giant icons, and that makes icons bigger when the cursor is on top of them?
2010-02-22T03:33:00.000Z	Red_HamsterX	Sledge	are you still there?
2010-02-22T03:33:00.000Z	Sledge	Red_HamsterX	 yes that is what im talking about
2010-02-22T03:34:00.000Z	Red_HamsterX	Sledge	that's called the 'dock' in OS X. Try using that term while searching for leads.
2010-02-22T03:35:00.000Z	Sledge	Red_HamsterX	 thanks
2010-02-22T03:35:00.000Z	Red_HamsterX	Sledge	I can't point you in the direction of any project or package in particular because I don't want such functionality on my Linux systems. I just keep it on my Mac, for when I actually have to develop for that platform.
2010-02-22T03:37:00.000Z	Red_HamsterX	Sledge	XQDE might be like what you want, but it's KDE-based and if you're not using Kubuntu, you'd have to play with some OS stuff to make the switch. (It's a good way to learn about how Ubuntu is set up if you're willing to nuke everything when done)
2010-02-22T04:07:00.000Z	Sledge	Red_HamsterX	 i found something else, ill show you when im done
2010-02-22T04:07:00.000Z	Sledge	Red_HamsterX	 i have libwnck22, this theme calls for 1.0
