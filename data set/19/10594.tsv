2007-09-22T12:42:00.000Z	Frustrated		Yeah, it might be broken or something
2007-09-22T12:42:00.000Z	Frustrated		I'll try a different one
2007-09-22T12:43:00.000Z	Frustrated		Now it works
2007-09-22T12:43:00.000Z	Frustrated		I used anther disc and it works now
2007-09-22T12:45:00.000Z	Frustrated		This might be slightly offtopic, but does Linux provide any effective tools for shrinking png size without affecting the quality?
2007-09-22T12:46:00.000Z	Frustrated		Does that come with the default package?
2007-09-22T12:48:00.000Z	Frustrated		Well, I am currently erasing another disc to make sure that it is empty
2007-09-22T12:49:00.000Z	Frustrated		Then I'll try burning the ISO again
2007-09-22T12:49:00.000Z	Frustrated		I have kind of bad memories of Nero now :/
2007-09-22T12:49:00.000Z	Frustrated		It has failed me before as well
2007-09-22T12:49:00.000Z	Pelo	Frustrated	burn at very low speed
2007-09-22T12:56:00.000Z	Pelo	Frustrated	 as low as you can
2007-09-22T12:57:00.000Z	Pelo	Frustrated	whut ?
2007-09-22T12:57:00.000Z	Pelo	Frustrated	 if you don'T know what they mean, leave them alone
2007-09-22T12:58:00.000Z	Pelo	Frustrated	 and you are burning an imaghe, not  burning data , get out of there now
2007-09-22T12:58:00.000Z	Frustrated	Pelo	What do you actually mean?
2007-09-22T12:59:00.000Z	Pelo	Frustrated	you want to burn an iso file ? that is a cd image, you do not copy it to a cd like files,  you need to "burn image" , look around your menus for that option
2007-09-22T13:01:00.000Z	Frustrated	Pelo	Using the open source one now
2007-09-22T13:01:00.000Z	Pelo	Frustrated	best of luck
