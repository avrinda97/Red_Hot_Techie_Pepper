2009-06-19T07:36:00.000Z	jimmyjh		hello all, is there a way to disable gnome-panel?
2009-06-19T07:36:00.000Z	Titan8990	jimmyjh	use a different DE?
2009-06-19T07:37:00.000Z	jimmyjh	Titan8990	well i wanted to keep gnome, i wanted to replace both panels with an dock
2009-06-19T07:37:00.000Z	Titan8990	jimmyjh	you should be able to right click on the panel to delete it
2009-06-19T07:37:00.000Z	Titan8990	jimmyjh	may have to uncheck "locked"
2009-06-19T07:38:00.000Z	Titan8990	jimmyjh	but you will be losing a clock and possibly a notification area
2009-06-19T07:38:00.000Z	jimmyjh	Titan8990	i dont wanna delete the panels.. i was wondering if there was a way to stop the loading or kill gnome-panel
2009-06-19T07:38:00.000Z	jimmyjh	Titan8990	so easy putting them back on later...
2009-06-19T07:38:00.000Z	Titan8990	jimmyjh	ehh
2009-06-19T07:39:00.000Z	Titan8990	jimmyjh	don't use gnome but try: ps | grep gnome-panel
2009-06-19T07:39:00.000Z	Titan8990	jimmyjh	then kill the pid
2009-06-19T07:41:00.000Z	jimmyjh	Titan8990	it comes back on,, it has that issue lol
2009-06-19T07:42:00.000Z	Titan8990	jimmyjh	wouldn't know then, havn't tried anything like that
2009-06-19T07:42:00.000Z	Titan8990	jimmyjh	you could just remove the bottom panel and auto-hide the top
2009-06-19T07:42:00.000Z	jimmyjh	Titan8990	 yea would be nice to do,, what do you use?
2009-06-19T07:42:00.000Z	jimmyjh	Titan8990	.. true
2009-06-19T07:42:00.000Z	Titan8990	jimmyjh	XFCE on my desktop and icewm on my laptop
2009-06-19T07:43:00.000Z	Titan8990	jimmyjh	I like lighter-weight desktops
2009-06-19T07:43:00.000Z	jimmyjh	Titan8990	lxde is looking nice
