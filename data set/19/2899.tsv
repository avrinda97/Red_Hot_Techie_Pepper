2010-05-09T05:00:00.000Z	krazykrivda		how do i put something in fstab?
2010-05-09T05:01:00.000Z	edbian	krazykrivda	Using a text editor as root.  "gksu gedit /etc/fstab"
2010-06-13T21:55:00.000Z	edbian	krazykrivda	Load a live CD and see if it's still there.  From there you can reinstall grub.
2010-06-13T21:55:00.000Z	krazykrivda	edbian	my live CD doesn'tdo anythign at bootup
2010-06-13T21:56:00.000Z	edbian	krazykrivda	Then you have to get into your bios and tell the system to boot from the CD
2010-06-13T21:56:00.000Z	edbian	krazykrivda	What?  I thought you said you lost grub and you thought you erased Ubuntu?
2010-06-13T21:57:00.000Z	edbian	krazykrivda	So how did you get into Ubuntu right now?
2010-06-13T21:57:00.000Z	edbian	krazykrivda	Then you did run the live CD
2010-06-13T21:58:00.000Z	edbian	krazykrivda	That's what you're in right now.  Go to gparted (it might be called partition editor).  Or look at the output of sudo fdisk -l
2010-06-13T21:58:00.000Z	krazykrivda	edbian	Before, when everythign WAS working.. i would boot and get several options, variosu ubuntu options, and then windows, windows vista etc... if I clicked my win7, i woudl get ubuntu or windows
2010-06-13T21:58:00.000Z	edbian	krazykrivda	Do you see your ubuntu partition there?
2010-06-13T21:58:00.000Z	edbian	krazykrivda	Yeah, that's called the grub menu.
2010-06-13T21:59:00.000Z	krazykrivda	edbian	now i just go straight to the windows/ubuntu option
2010-06-13T21:59:00.000Z	edbian	krazykrivda	See what I just said a bit ago? ^ ^
2010-06-13T21:59:00.000Z	krazykrivda	edbian	yes.. I looked in gparted.. and I have several partitions.. and I'm fearing that the one I used.. is wiped.. althoguh I do not recall which it was
2010-06-13T22:00:00.000Z	edbian	krazykrivda	You can mount those partitions on the live CD and see what's on them.  They should show up in "Computer"
2011-08-05T02:04:00.000Z	edbian	krazykrivda	You need a space after the ;
2011-08-05T02:04:00.000Z	krazykrivda	edbian	still same results
2011-08-05T02:04:00.000Z	edbian	krazykrivda	then IDK
