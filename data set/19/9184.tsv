2007-11-08T00:29:00.000Z	manchicken		Is there a GUI diff program for GNOME?
2007-11-08T00:30:00.000Z	scorp123	manchicken	gvimdiff
2007-11-08T00:30:00.000Z	manchicken	scorp123	That's not a GNOMEish program :P
2007-11-08T00:30:00.000Z	scorp123	manchicken	gvimdiff?? Of course it is.
2007-11-08T00:31:00.000Z	scorp123	manchicken	as you can tell by the letter "g" there :-)
2007-11-08T00:32:00.000Z	manchicken	scorp123	No, that's just vim wrapped in a GTK styled window.  It's still a text-based editor.
2007-11-08T00:33:00.000Z	scorp123	manchicken	of course it is. "vim" and "diff" are always about text. But the menus work tip top, so you don't need to bother about vim's cryptic commands such as ":wq" and all that.
2007-11-08T00:34:00.000Z	manchicken	scorp123	Have you ever used kompare?
2007-11-08T00:34:00.000Z	manchicken	scorp123	Or winmerge?
2007-11-08T00:34:00.000Z	scorp123	manchicken	"k"ompare <= sounds like a KDE program?
2007-11-08T00:35:00.000Z	manchicken	scorp123	I'm looking for something more like that.
2007-11-08T00:35:00.000Z	manchicken	scorp123	Yeah
2007-11-08T00:35:00.000Z	scorp123	manchicken	sorry, garbled message
2007-11-08T00:35:00.000Z	scorp123	manchicken	kompare ... sounds like a KDE program?
2007-11-08T00:35:00.000Z	manchicken	scorp123	Yes
2007-11-08T00:35:00.000Z	scorp123	manchicken	haven't been on KDE in a while now
2007-11-08T00:35:00.000Z	manchicken	scorp123	Ever used winmerge?
2007-11-08T00:36:00.000Z	scorp123	manchicken	although ... my corporate desktop is KDE but whenever I do "vi" or "diff" I am on the command line anyway :-)  So ... sorry, no, I don't know those programs.
2007-11-08T00:39:00.000Z	manchicken	scorp123	Yes, "meld" is the program I was looking for.
