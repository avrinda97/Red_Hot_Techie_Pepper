2010-05-01T10:21:00.000Z	thak		I was wonder if anyone knows why DVD-RWs might be recognized for a second and then quickly dissappear
2010-05-01T10:21:00.000Z	thak		Does that make any sense?
2010-05-01T10:22:00.000Z	brous-kee	thak	 see the results of  dmesg perhaps?
2010-05-01T10:22:00.000Z	thak	brous-kee	how do I run that?
2010-05-01T10:23:00.000Z	brous-kee	thak	on command line   type   dmesg
2010-05-01T10:24:00.000Z	thak	brous-kee	Can you help me interpret? http://pastebin.com/R3uR2dTn
2010-05-01T10:27:00.000Z	brous-kee	thak	it seems okay, what is the issue?
2010-05-01T10:28:00.000Z	thak	brous-kee	Essentially if I manage to blank a disk via Brasero it seems to bork it
2010-05-01T10:28:00.000Z	thak	brous-kee	and sometimes when I just put a disk in it will recognize it for a second and then go away
2010-05-01T10:28:00.000Z	brous-kee	thak	 insert a non-blank dvd after.. can it read it?
2010-05-01T10:32:00.000Z	thak	brous-kee	I put a music CD in and it wasn't recognized
2010-05-01T10:32:00.000Z	thak	brous-kee	I can eject by going eject /dev/cdrom but it doesn't automount, although it does show up for a moment
2010-05-01T10:33:00.000Z	brous-kee	thak	 look in your /etc/fstab file to see how the cdrom/dvd is mounting
2010-05-01T10:34:00.000Z	thak	brous-kee	Once more I have no idea what this should look like: http://pastebin.com/irvfHDT8
2010-05-01T10:36:00.000Z	brous-kee	thak	 looks okay to me
2010-05-01T10:40:00.000Z	thak	brous-kee	What does the manual mount command look like? Would that help?
2010-05-01T10:41:00.000Z	brous-kee	thak	 man mount  please  and i believe it has a sample command there n the man pages
2010-05-01T10:41:00.000Z	thak	brous-kee	sudo mount /dev/scd0 /media/cdrom0 doesn't work, but could I do something similar to recognize the disk?
2010-05-01T11:22:00.000Z	brous-kee	thak	 your'e welcome
