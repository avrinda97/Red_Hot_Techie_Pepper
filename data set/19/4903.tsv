2008-10-13T12:46:00.000Z	mib_88cqzp94		hello everyone :)
2008-10-13T12:46:00.000Z	mib_88cqzp94		what are you talking about?
2008-10-13T12:48:00.000Z	mib_88cqzp94		guys, can I ask something..?
2008-10-13T12:49:00.000Z	frybye	mib_88cqzp94	just ask - no need to ask to ask..
2008-10-13T12:50:00.000Z	frybye	mib_88cqzp94	is a support channel for ubuntu linux operating system...
2008-10-13T12:51:00.000Z	frybye	mib_88cqzp94	and so not a place for general chat... specific tech quesitons about this o.system..
2008-10-13T12:51:00.000Z	frybye	mib_88cqzp94	i think most folks find the one in firefox 3 does it all..
2008-10-13T12:53:00.000Z	frybye	mib_88cqzp94	if not mistaken it can restart etc..
2008-10-13T12:57:00.000Z	frybye	mib_88cqzp94	paste the results from the termin window to - http://paste.ubuntu.com/ and then copy the resulting url for the past here ok?
2008-10-13T12:59:00.000Z	frybye	mib_88cqzp94	it is a way of giving folks here access to the results of stuff you do in the terminal window - to troubleshoot better...
2008-10-13T13:01:00.000Z	frybye	mib_88cqzp94	well done - you cracked the thing with pasting.. :=)
2008-10-13T13:06:00.000Z	frybye	mib_88cqzp94	you need to do an update - top left in synaptic - after youi click to add new repos...
2008-10-13T13:08:00.000Z	frybye	mib_88cqzp94	when ppl give you an apt-get for this or that here - it is very easy to copy and past it to the terminal ans so have no mistakes etc..
2008-10-13T13:09:00.000Z	mib_88cqzp94	frybye	yes it is..
2008-10-13T13:11:00.000Z	frybye	mib_88cqzp94	some download sites use code that requires that it is a normal browser that is d-loading i guess...
2008-10-13T13:12:00.000Z	mib_88cqzp94	frybye	well, the download link is from a website that ask for temporary username and password for login. Is it the case? So I can't use download manager?
2008-10-13T13:12:00.000Z	frybye	mib_88cqzp94	i am no expert - perhaps others know better.. ??
2008-10-13T13:13:00.000Z	mib_88cqzp94	frybye	okay, thank you so much :)
