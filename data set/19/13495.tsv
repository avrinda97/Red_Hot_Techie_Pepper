2005-05-06T10:28:00.000Z	Absenth	x2comp	the root account is disabled by default on ubuntu.  you have to enable it.  the Ubuntu/Debian way of doing things is through sudo.
2005-05-06T10:29:00.000Z	Absenth	x2comp	vi, and nano I believe are both installed by default.
2005-05-06T10:45:00.000Z	Absenth	x2comp	which windows programs.
2005-05-06T10:46:00.000Z	Absenth	x2comp	wine works for several, or if you're willing to spend $39 for crossover office, I think it's worth every penny,.
2005-05-06T10:48:00.000Z	Absenth	x2comp	I've been a redhat/clones guy since 5.2  Been using ubuntu for about a month now, and won't go back if I can avoid it.
2005-05-06T10:50:00.000Z	Absenth	x2comp	imho, Windows is super easy to setup, and it's performance/stability degrades over the next 3 months -> 12 months.
2005-05-06T10:50:00.000Z	Absenth	x2comp	linux takes longer to get configured the way you want it, but it's performance/stability seem to stay pretty constant after that point.
2005-05-06T10:51:00.000Z	Absenth	x2comp	we have 9 servers running deadrat 8.0 at work, that each have over 200 days of uptime, with over 45 users on each of them.
2005-05-06T10:55:00.000Z	Absenth	x2comp	linux has more programs?  that's about right.
2005-05-06T10:56:00.000Z	Absenth	x2comp	for games there's Cedega.  It works for most the games I play,  Including World of Warcraft, Half Life 2, and Star Wars Galaxies.
2005-05-06T10:56:00.000Z	Absenth	x2comp	with Cedega you can.

2005-05-06T10:59:00.000Z	Absenth	x2comp	I almost picked up an Amd64 3000+ last weekend.  Decided to replace my nforce2 board, and hold out for cheep dual cores
2005-05-06T11:08:00.000Z	Absenth	x2comp	running my 2400+ at 11/200 (simple 200mhz overclock) but the memory timings are 1:1
2005-05-06T11:10:00.000Z	Absenth	x2comp	yeah, I only got mine to 200 from 133 because I reduced the multiplier from 15 to 11
2005-05-06T11:12:00.000Z	Absenth	x2comp	time to crack open google, and do some research.  Start with www.overclockers.com  later all.
