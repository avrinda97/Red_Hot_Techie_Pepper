2006-03-01T12:29:00.000Z	Quinch		Oh, by the way, Ompaul, you probably don't remember, but about a week ago, I bugged you about a disk's worth of files that disappeared and couldn't find. I found out what happened to them, though I've no idea how I've accomplished that.
2006-03-01T12:30:00.000Z	ompaul	Quinch	vague
2006-03-01T12:32:00.000Z	ompaul	Quinch	ooch / lucky
2006-03-01T12:34:00.000Z	Quinch	ompaul	Yeah. I'd never have found it out if I didn't decide to mess with fstab and mounting for kicks. Took a look in /media and bam, there it was. Took me a while to piece together what happened. Altough I still don't understand how I could have copied it like that. I mean, I dragged and dropped it in Nautilus from /media to... where? /media? But that would be essentially copying it to the same place.
2006-03-01T12:34:00.000Z	ompaul	Quinch	you got them back - don't worry about it
2006-03-01T12:35:00.000Z	Quinch	ompaul	Yep, that's the main thing. I think I'll chalk up this one up to the list of unexplainable things. Anything, thanks again for putting up with me earlier.

2006-05-24T14:27:00.000Z	Quinch	ompaul	No, I meant the s/m/n thing... what did that mean?

2006-05-24T14:31:00.000Z	ompaul	Quinch	the little "lifebouy" type red and white icon has a good beginners guide for ubuntu
2006-05-24T14:32:00.000Z	Quinch	ompaul	I know that one. I've gone through it. I'm not looking for Ubuntu-specific, but how the whole thing works under the hood, as it were.
2006-05-24T14:32:00.000Z	ompaul	Quinch	well there is help.ubuntu.com wiki.ubuntu.com
2006-05-24T14:32:00.000Z	ompaul	Quinch	^^^
