2006-07-15T11:45:00.000Z	pharcvde		seg fault means u tried to access memory outside your assigned page
2006-07-15T11:47:00.000Z	epimer	pharcvde	i have no idea what you just said, but ty anyway: )
2006-07-15T11:48:00.000Z	pharcvde		 epimer, the os assigns a program to run in a specified block of memory
2006-07-15T11:48:00.000Z	pharcvde		if the program tries to run outside of that then you get a segmentation fault
2006-07-15T11:48:00.000Z	epimer		ok
2006-07-15T11:48:00.000Z	epimer		why would it do that. and how would it be fixed?
2006-07-15T11:48:00.000Z	pharcvde	epimer	the program could ahve a bug in it
2006-07-15T11:49:00.000Z	pharcvde		where it is gettign a buffer overlflow of some sort
2006-07-15T11:49:00.000Z	epimer	pharcvde	given that it's devilspie, is it likely that i'm screwing up the .ds files and that's doing it?
2006-07-15T11:50:00.000Z	pharcvde	epimer	i've actually never used that program before...
2006-07-15T11:50:00.000Z	pharcvde	epimer	i'm not even sure what it is for
2006-07-15T11:51:00.000Z	epimer	pharcvde	oh, ok. it involves writing little scripts to tell different windows what to do (e.g. center, maximise, set workspace), etc.
2006-07-15T11:51:00.000Z	pharcvde	epimer	oh
2006-07-15T11:51:00.000Z	epimer		and given that i'm grossly incompetent, i'd be willing to bet it's my terrible scripting files that are causing problems
2006-07-15T11:51:00.000Z	pharcvde	epimer	its possible
2006-07-15T11:52:00.000Z	pharcvde	epimer	sorry i couldnt be of more help
2006-07-15T11:52:00.000Z	epimer	pharcvde	thing is, it was working fine until i wrote a new one for amarok. so i deleted that script, and tried it again, and it's still broken :-/
2006-07-15T11:52:00.000Z	epimer	pharcvde	no problem, you've been helpful all the same :)
