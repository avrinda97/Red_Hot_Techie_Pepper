2007-05-31T06:41:00.000Z	sobersabre		hi guys.
2007-05-31T06:42:00.000Z	sobersabre		what is more usable - audacious or bmpx ?
2007-05-31T06:42:00.000Z	ikonia	sobersabre	personal choice
2007-05-31T06:42:00.000Z	sobersabre	ikonia	so what.
2007-05-31T06:42:00.000Z	ikonia	sobersabre	so its personal preference - not fact
2007-05-31T06:48:00.000Z	sobersabre	ikonia	I think it is personal preference in case both work, and  thus are comparable.
2007-05-31T06:48:00.000Z	sobersabre	ikonia	bmpx doesn't work on my machine.
2007-12-31T01:42:00.000Z	ikonia	sobersabre	why would it be missing a library
2007-12-31T01:42:00.000Z	ikonia	sobersabre	it would not install if it was missing a dependency
2007-12-31T01:42:00.000Z	sobersabre	ikonia	I don't know.
2007-12-31T01:42:00.000Z	sobersabre	ikonia	there are misc. deps.
2007-12-31T01:42:00.000Z	ikonia	sobersabre	functionatliy = required
2008-08-08T14:43:00.000Z	ikonia	sobersabre	I think so yes
2008-08-08T14:43:00.000Z	ikonia	sobersabre	it's not bleeding edge but not far
2009-03-28T16:43:00.000Z	ikonia	sobersabre	what version of ubuntu is this
2009-03-28T16:43:00.000Z	ikonia	sobersabre	lots of missing files
2012-06-25T23:36:00.000Z	ikonia	sobersabre	intel
2012-06-25T23:37:00.000Z	sobersabre	ikonia	I am currently on it and I'm suffering.
2012-06-25T23:37:00.000Z	ikonia	sobersabre	that is the only other real option
