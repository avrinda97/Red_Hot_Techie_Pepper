2009-02-04T08:44:00.000Z	mib_ribrwqt8		wad do u mean?
2009-02-04T08:46:00.000Z	mib_ribrwqt8		the router will probably allow that traffic
2009-02-04T08:46:00.000Z	mib_ribrwqt8		only if a remote is trying to access without invitation the router will block ..
2009-02-04T08:46:00.000Z	mib_ribrwqt8		or am I off ..

2009-02-04T08:48:00.000Z	mib_ribrwqt8		it's just a very interesting challenge
2009-02-04T08:48:00.000Z	Cpudan80	mib_ribrwqt8	networking doesnt work like that
2009-02-04T08:49:00.000Z	Cpudan80	mib_ribrwqt8	I mean you can send invitations I guess, but that would require some fancy stuff
2009-02-04T08:49:00.000Z	mib_ribrwqt8	Cpudan80	ah .. why?
2009-02-04T08:50:00.000Z	Cpudan80	mib_ribrwqt8	What would have to happen (on consumer grade routers) would be for your server to open a connection to the guy on the other end
2009-02-04T08:50:00.000Z	Cpudan80	mib_ribrwqt8	then the guy on the other end can do whatever needs to be done
2009-02-04T08:50:00.000Z	mib_ribrwqt8	Cpudan80	Oh thanks
2009-02-04T08:50:00.000Z	Cpudan80	mib_ribrwqt8	##networking if you want to talk more
2009-02-04T08:51:00.000Z	mib_ribrwqt8	Cpudan80	So it will have to be a socket connection?
2009-02-04T08:51:00.000Z	mib_ribrwqt8	Cpudan80	thanks .. u've helped enuff! :D
