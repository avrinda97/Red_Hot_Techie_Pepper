2008-10-19T12:46:00.000Z	gandalfcome		I installed new open office 3 on my gfs laptop but it seems to be installed in /opt/openoffice3/.... and not accesible via the menu. my gf is complaining, which I can understand. Why is openoffice 3 not inthe repos and if I install it is not in the menus.
2008-10-19T12:46:00.000Z	Mez	gandalfcome	It's not in the archives because 1) It's new 2) we're in freeze.
2008-10-19T12:48:00.000Z	gandalfcome	Mez	It's now a week old, but debs have existed for very long time (of course only beta or rc but you could see whats it is doing from there). what do you mean by freeze?
2008-10-19T12:49:00.000Z	Mez	gandalfcome	we tend not to package RC stuff, and debs from upstream dont get into ubuntu, ubuntu/debian have to package it ourselves
2008-10-19T12:54:00.000Z	gandalfcome	Mez	to compete with windows. these big opensource packages should be added into ubuntu a few days later, even if they are upstream. My GF says, on windows I could just download and install the new version and, its hard to compete with that :D. Isn't it possible to make a temporary solution until the new version comes out?
2008-10-19T12:56:00.000Z	Mez	gandalfcome	create a menu link for what you've installed?
2008-10-19T13:01:00.000Z	gandalfcome	Mez	thats what I'm going to do, but this only works if people know that it installs in /opt/.... and that it doesnt just create links. I'm suggesting making it easier for newbies to get new opensource software packages like openoffice. I guess that is one of the widest used opensource packages. well anyway, not having to have a virus scanner and a quick os will hopefully convince her to stay on ubuntu :D
2008-10-19T13:02:00.000Z	Mez	gandalfcome	yeah, that's the fault of the OOo packagers though. This is why it takes time for ubuntu - quality control. We only opackage stable stuff
2008-10-19T13:04:00.000Z	gandalfcome	Mez	I didnt mean including betas or rcs, im talking about the final release (the 13th of oct one). So if OOo would make a ubuntu package you would include it or not?
2008-10-19T13:05:00.000Z	gandalfcome	Mez	Or is it olicy to compile it from source?
2008-10-19T13:06:00.000Z	Mez	gandalfcome	It's policy for it to be compiled from source on our buildds... so a debian packager or an ubuntu packager has to make a package, ubuntu specific patches have to be applied, etc etc. PLUS, intrepid is near release. We froze a month ago. Please, feel free to go consult the developer documentation
2008-10-19T13:07:00.000Z	gandalfcome	Mez	will openoffice 3 come on hardy? after intrepids release?
2008-10-19T13:07:00.000Z	Mez	gandalfcome	hardy is before intrepid. Only security updates are applied to older versions of ubuntu
2008-10-19T13:08:00.000Z	Mez	gandalfcome	we actually froze back in june...
2008-10-19T13:09:00.000Z	Mez	gandalfcome	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/TimeBasedReleases <-- please read, this conversation is getting beyond the scope of this channel.
2008-10-19T13:11:00.000Z	gandalfcome	Mez	This suggestion adding OO3 as soon as it comes out (creating an exception). wheres the best place to discuss this? Is there a suggestion box ;-)
2008-10-19T13:13:00.000Z	Mez	gandalfcome	read what the exceptions are generally for - please, I'm not here to do your research for you, your answer has been given.
2008-10-19T13:14:00.000Z	Mez	gandalfcome	and the final freeze was 3 days ago. It's bugfixes and ONLY bugfixes now
2008-10-19T13:15:00.000Z	gandalfcome	Mez	okay
