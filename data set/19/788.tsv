2011-08-26T22:02:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain		ah. what version?
2011-08-26T22:04:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain		ok look
2011-08-26T22:04:00.000Z	librarian-user01	[THC]AcidRain	- my fstab shows /dev/sdb1 as mounted to the mount point /
2011-08-26T22:06:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain	librarian-user01	im not sure. but that may be a permissions issue as well
2011-08-26T22:07:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain	librarian-user01	i rly think that both of you have the same issue
2011-08-26T22:09:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain	librarian-user01	same issue for you. i was right
2011-08-26T22:10:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain	librarian-user01	do "sudo fdisk -l" to find the mount point. and change it like that
2011-08-26T22:13:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain	librarian-user01	after changing the owner. try to unplug it and plug it back in
2011-08-26T22:16:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain	librarian-user01	check the permissions again to confirm that they actually changed
2011-08-26T22:18:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain	librarian-user01	did you use "sudo" to change permission?
2011-08-26T22:22:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain	librarian-user01	paste your fstab to pastebin.com and show link
2011-08-26T22:22:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain	librarian-user01	also tell me what the drive mount point is
2011-08-26T22:25:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain	librarian-user01	and the mount point of your drive you are having issues with?
2011-08-26T22:26:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain	librarian-user01	right. but other flash drives dont require root to mount
2011-08-26T22:27:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain	librarian-user01	try this: blkid
2011-08-26T22:28:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain	librarian-user01	with ext4 filesystem. i dont see why we are having issues changing the owner
2011-08-26T22:28:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain	librarian-user01	actually... i think mounting anything at "/" requires root
2011-08-26T22:28:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain	librarian-user01	type is vfat?
2011-08-26T22:29:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain	librarian-user01	and im sure that a uuid is longer than 8 characters. i may be wrong though
