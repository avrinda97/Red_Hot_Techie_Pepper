2006-12-09T12:10:00.000Z	echosystm		guys, i have a wee question to ask
2006-12-09T12:10:00.000Z	echosystm		im installing x/gnome on ubuntu server
2006-12-09T12:10:00.000Z	echosystm		i used aptitude
2006-12-09T12:10:00.000Z	echosystm		and i got this bs about needing libfam0 or something
2006-12-09T12:11:00.000Z	echosystm		then it said "keep blah blah blah at current version"
2006-12-09T12:11:00.000Z	echosystm		and said y/n or quit
2006-12-09T12:11:00.000Z	echosystm		i just said yeah lets do it
2006-12-09T12:11:00.000Z	echosystm		but in hindsight i prbably should have checked what "it" actually is
2006-12-09T12:11:00.000Z	echosystm		:P
2006-12-09T12:11:00.000Z	echosystm		can anyone help?
2006-12-09T12:12:00.000Z	lemonsCC	echosystm	can you be more specific?  what was the issue?
2006-12-09T12:13:00.000Z	lemonsCC	echosystm	it should install it automatically, its normal
2006-12-09T12:13:00.000Z	lemonsCC	echosystm	just a library for the package
2006-12-09T12:17:00.000Z	lemonsCC	echosystm	thats fine just wait for it to finish
2006-12-09T12:18:00.000Z	lemonsCC	echosystm	i think it was just telling you how much memory the install would take and such (this is normal)
2006-12-09T12:19:00.000Z	lemonsCC	echosystm	x-window-system-core has a million things associated with it so all is good
2006-12-09T12:20:00.000Z	lemonsCC	echosystm	 i recoomend waiting til its done and trying startx and see if it worked
2006-12-09T12:20:00.000Z	lemonsCC	echosystm	no need to troubleshoot non-existant problems
2006-12-09T12:25:00.000Z	lemonsCC	echosystm	done installing yet?
