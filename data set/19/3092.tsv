2009-11-16T06:38:00.000Z	lotec	epinky	i have not tried to install yet, if it is all not going to work. i sent you a link
2009-11-16T06:40:00.000Z	epinky	lotec	look at this http://whatareyoublogging.blogspot.com/2008/09/ubuntu-netbook-remix-on-acer-aspire-one.html
2009-11-16T06:42:00.000Z	epinky	lotec	it's using UNR 8.04, however with latest there are some problems with audio and keyboard. What operating system is running now?
2009-11-16T06:42:00.000Z	lotec		xp
2009-11-16T06:43:00.000Z	lotec	epinky	xp
2009-11-16T06:43:00.000Z	epinky	lotec	my advice is that "if it works then don't touch it" :)
2009-11-16T06:45:00.000Z	lotec	epinky	maybe ill just install to a 4gb sd card and boot ubuntu that way
2009-11-16T06:46:00.000Z	epinky	lotec	good idea!, it's better to try before installing :)
