2008-07-22T08:28:00.000Z	s_spiff	s3a	thanks, will check it out
2008-07-22T08:28:00.000Z	s3a	s_spiff	np, tell me if it works for u if im here
2008-07-22T08:32:00.000Z	s_spiff	s3a	I'l try install sane, but should I uninstall xsane for that? or both can work side by side?
2008-07-22T08:34:00.000Z	s3a	s_spiff	im not sure honestly try first with both then uninstall xsane
2008-07-22T08:34:00.000Z	s3a	s_spiff	u can also try on live cd first
2008-07-22T08:34:00.000Z	s3a	s_spiff	probably
2008-07-22T08:34:00.000Z	s3a	s_spiff	sry this is not my area of expertise :(
2008-07-22T08:49:00.000Z	s_spiff	s3a	I installed sane without removing xsane, but when I clikc on GIME > File > Aqure > Sane.... nothing happens... :( what to do?
2008-07-22T08:51:00.000Z	s3a	s_spiff	sry like i said im not an expert with scanners, i suggest posting to the thread i gave u and stating u have a similar problem since the thread is recent because the first post was 3 weeks ago and the last one was 1 week ago
2008-07-22T08:52:00.000Z	s_spiff	s3a	okies, would have done that, but the forums are acting weird today... can't seem to login and post. :(
