2012-04-14T06:28:00.000Z	Ben64	TechIsCool	what did you run exactly
2012-04-14T06:29:00.000Z	TechIsCool		How can I repair the install or is it a format
2012-04-14T06:29:00.000Z	TechIsCool		this is server not gui
2012-04-14T06:30:00.000Z	Ben64	TechIsCool	if you don't show the command or script you ran, the likelihood of someone here fixing your problem is very small
2012-04-14T06:30:00.000Z	TechIsCool	Ben64	http://shirker.blog.com/2010/03/29/daily-rsnapshot-backup-mysql-db-mysqldump-gzip-rsync/ this and I replaced the BAKRSNROOT=/raid5/mysql_dump with BAKRSNROOT=
2012-04-14T06:30:00.000Z	TechIsCool		the top script not bottom
2012-04-14T06:31:00.000Z	TechIsCool		I would assume it deleted root right... fail
2012-04-14T06:32:00.000Z	Ben64	TechIsCool	you set BAKRSNROOT as what?
2012-04-14T06:32:00.000Z	TechIsCool	Ben64	blank
2012-04-14T06:32:00.000Z	TechIsCool		I failed at setting a folder unintentional
2012-04-14T06:32:00.000Z	TechIsCool		I know it happened though
2012-04-14T06:33:00.000Z	Ben64	TechIsCool	and you ran the script as root i guess?
2012-04-14T06:33:00.000Z	TechIsCool	Ben64	Yup
2012-04-14T06:34:00.000Z	Ben64		yeah, thats not good, but there shouldn't really be anything in / that could be deleted like that
2012-04-14T06:38:00.000Z	TechIsCool	Ben64	if I boot into recovery I have 3 partitions sda 1 titled linux sda2 extened and sda5 linux vm
