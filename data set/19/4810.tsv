2010-11-27T06:22:00.000Z	zetheroo		ok ... so according to synaptic I have the latest Java installed ... but FF is obviously not seeing it that way
2010-11-27T06:24:00.000Z	zetheroo		java.com says: Your Java version is Version 6 Update 20.  ... but in synaptic I have updated to 22
2010-11-27T06:26:00.000Z	zetheroo		anyone with 10.10 using FF not able to access this page? : http://supportapj.dell.com/support/downloads/index.aspx?c=au&l=en&s=dhs
2010-11-27T06:26:00.000Z	quant	zetheroo	works for me
2010-11-27T06:27:00.000Z	zetheroo	quant	and can you see what this says: http://www.java.com/en/download/installed.jsp?detect=jre&try=1
2010-11-27T06:27:00.000Z	quant	zetheroo	indeed I can
2010-11-27T06:28:00.000Z	zetheroo	quant	thanks
2010-11-27T06:28:00.000Z	quant	zetheroo	np
2010-11-27T06:30:00.000Z	zetheroo	quant	for my it says that I am using version 6 update 20
2010-11-27T06:32:00.000Z	quant	zetheroo	yes, same
2010-11-27T06:33:00.000Z	zetheroo	quant	that's odd ... 'cause you probably also have update 22 installed in synaptic ...
2010-11-27T06:33:00.000Z	quant	zetheroo	let me check again
2010-11-27T06:33:00.000Z	quant	zetheroo	it's 22, you're right
2010-11-27T06:34:00.000Z	zetheroo	quant	hmm
2010-11-27T06:35:00.000Z	zetheroo	quant	but still oddly you can still access that page ... whereas I cannot
2010-11-27T06:38:00.000Z	zetheroo	quant	btw ... did you open that dell link in FF?
2010-11-27T06:39:00.000Z	quant	zetheroo	yes
2010-11-27T06:39:00.000Z	zetheroo	quant	ok ... because that link works fine for me in Chromium ... but not at all in FF
2010-11-27T06:40:00.000Z	zetheroo	quant	and this is testing on two machines both running fully updated 10.10
