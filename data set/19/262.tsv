2012-05-16T10:32:00.000Z	kkrauss	dr_willis	in other version of ubuntu I could move the window control buttons back to the right side, can that be done with unity/
2012-05-16T10:36:00.000Z	kkrauss	dr_willis	Why dont they just make it an option you can access easily instead of using terminal lol
2012-05-16T10:36:00.000Z	dr_willis	kkrauss	 its a per theme setting. some themes do move them to the right hand side
2012-05-16T10:37:00.000Z	dr_willis	kkrauss	 because when mazed tthey are not part of the window any more
2012-05-16T10:39:00.000Z	dr_willis	kkrauss	 under the server settings. a autoconnect checkbox
