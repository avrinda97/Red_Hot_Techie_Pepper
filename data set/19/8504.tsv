2007-03-28T07:04:00.000Z	abasinisvacant		question:  i' want to upgrade my Fedora to Ubuntu.  i have the cd and everything, but i have one question, will my files be erased?
2007-03-28T07:05:00.000Z	abasinisvacant		hello?
2007-03-28T07:06:00.000Z	harpette	abasinisvacant	/usr, /var, /boot will be reformatted blank
2007-03-28T07:07:00.000Z	abasinisvacant	harpette	huh?
2007-03-28T07:08:00.000Z	harpette	abasinisvacant	if you have a separate partition for /home, i think you're safe. Otherwise everything will be erased
2007-03-28T07:09:00.000Z	harpette	abasinisvacant	i suppose that you're concerned with your personal data, not the system software, right?
2007-03-28T07:09:00.000Z	abasinisvacant	harpette	correct
2007-03-28T07:10:00.000Z	harpette	abasinisvacant	i recommend a separate partition for /home (any linux install doc will tell you what that is), and another for /usr/local. This way you can conserve them between systems
2007-03-28T07:11:00.000Z	harpette	abasinisvacant	df -h
2007-03-28T07:12:00.000Z	abasinisvacant	harpette	can i change my /home to a separate partition?
2007-03-28T07:12:00.000Z	harpette	abasinisvacant	then you need to make one. Boot from a live CD, or Systemrescue CD, ...
2007-03-28T07:12:00.000Z	harpette	abasinisvacant	...use parted or gparted to shrink your existing hda1 to the minimum, ...
2007-03-28T07:13:00.000Z	abasinisvacant	harpette	i don't know how to do that last part
2007-03-28T07:13:00.000Z	harpette	abasinisvacant	you're gonna have to read on hard drive partitioning
2007-03-28T07:15:00.000Z	harpette	abasinisvacant	in order to use parted or gparted correctly, you're gonna have to know what you're doing, so you have to learn, just like the rest of us, what partitioning (slicing) a drive is all about
2007-03-28T07:16:00.000Z	abasinisvacant	harpette	can i try to send myself 700mb of files over email?
2007-03-28T07:17:00.000Z	harpette	abasinisvacant	i doubt you'll find an e-mail agent that'll let you do that: gmail limits at 10M per mail
2007-03-28T07:17:00.000Z	abasinisvacant	harpette	ok, cause i've been trying to do that with gmail
2007-03-28T07:18:00.000Z	harpette	abasinisvacant	but you can burn a CD with all of your $HOME directory, provided it's under 700MB
