2006-05-28T11:37:00.000Z	njan	andrejkw	what do you mean by routers, what are they attached to, and how are you trying to attach them to your PC?
2006-05-28T11:41:00.000Z	njan	andrejkw	do they both use different IP address ranges?
2006-05-28T11:42:00.000Z	andrejkw	njan	yes one is 0.x and other 1.x
2006-05-28T11:42:00.000Z	njan	andrejkw	with your PC connected to both, can you paste the outputs of the ifconfig -a and route commands run using sudo to pastebin?
