2008-08-11T06:20:00.000Z	Syco54645	jmichelsen	i am trying to get windows xp to see my linux share, which is backwards from what i can find on google and what have you
2008-08-11T06:21:00.000Z	jmichelsen	Syco54645	this is what I was just doing as well
2008-08-11T06:21:00.000Z	jmichelsen	Syco54645	did you define the share in your smb.conf
2008-08-11T06:22:00.000Z	Syco54645	jmichelsen	yes i have, i can connect to it with my virtual machine that has xp installed on it (it is on the same machine as the share).  as soon as i try to access it from my laptop it does not work.  it gives no error, just keeps prompting for user and pass over and over again
2008-08-11T06:23:00.000Z	jmichelsen	Syco54645	yea same thing I had earlier
2008-08-11T06:23:00.000Z	jmichelsen	Syco54645	how did you define the share, guest ok = yes?
2008-08-11T06:23:00.000Z	Syco54645	jmichelsen	i have tried editing my registry on my laptop but it didnt work
2008-08-11T06:23:00.000Z	Syco54645	jmichelsen	let me check
2008-08-11T06:24:00.000Z	jmichelsen	Syco54645	no need to edit the win machine reg really, it is the samba share i beleive that causes that
2008-08-11T06:24:00.000Z	Syco54645	jmichelsen	guest ok = no
2008-08-11T06:25:00.000Z	jmichelsen	Syco54645	change to yes and see if you can access the share
2008-08-11T06:26:00.000Z	Syco54645	jmichelsen	will this not leave me open to anyone though
2008-08-11T06:26:00.000Z	jmichelsen	Syco54645	just for testing, it opens it to your local net
2008-08-11T06:27:00.000Z	Syco54645	jmichelsen	ok, let me check now
2008-08-11T06:28:00.000Z	Syco54645	jmichelsen	nope, didnt work.  i entered a username and password though
2008-08-11T06:29:00.000Z	jmichelsen	Syco54645	when you enter the usname pw does it show the servername there or laptop name
2008-08-11T06:34:00.000Z	Syco54645	jmichelsen	it shows BEHEMOTH\frank, which behemoth is the name of the machine where the share is located.  the server address is \\192.168.1.100\3-Music
2008-08-12T04:43:00.000Z	Syco54645	jmichelsen	are you around?
