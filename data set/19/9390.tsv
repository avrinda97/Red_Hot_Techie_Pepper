2006-12-25T10:48:00.000Z	needhel1		Anyone familar with running Windows games under ubuntu ? I get some weird errors when trying to execute it. (seems I have to reinstall Windows :( )
2006-12-25T10:49:00.000Z	dark_light	needhel1	do you have wine or cedega?
2006-12-25T10:49:00.000Z	needhel1	dark_light	I use wine
2006-12-25T10:50:00.000Z	needhel1	dark_light	I have tried three different Windows PC games. No luck with any of them :(
2006-12-25T10:50:00.000Z	dark_light	needhel1	you typed wine exec.exe, right?
2006-12-25T10:50:00.000Z	dark_light	needhel1	any errors? if yes, paste them at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org
2006-12-25T10:52:00.000Z	needhel1	dark_light	Game 1: odd Windows error turns up at once (Application Error....). Game 2: lets me install, but odd errors turns up when trying to run the game. Game 3: Also lets me install, but not play. It asks me for the original CD, not backup CD even though I DO use the original CD!
2006-12-25T10:53:00.000Z	needhel1	dark_light	burner: here is the error for one of the games: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/38770/
2006-12-25T10:54:00.000Z	dark_light	needhel1	maybe some dlls missing? or, hmm.. what about trying cedega? (note: cedega isnt free software)
2006-12-25T10:55:00.000Z	needhel1	dark_light	hmm.. how can I know which dll's should be missing? I will try cedega
2006-12-25T10:56:00.000Z	dark_light	needhel1	first try the lastest wine :P and, i don't know :( seems very gamwe-specific (ah, actually cedega has a bypass over this original cd thing. but try wine first)
2006-12-25T10:57:00.000Z	needhel1	dark_light	burner: here is the error for one of the other 3 games: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/38773/
2006-12-25T10:59:00.000Z	dark_light	needhel1	do you have a 3d video card? is 3d acceleration working?
2006-12-25T10:59:00.000Z	dark_light	needhel1	i think you can configure wine to do software rendering instead
2006-12-25T11:00:00.000Z	needhel1	dark_light	have abit nvidia  siluro t200
2006-12-25T11:01:00.000Z	dark_light	needhel1	type glxinfo|grep direct
2006-12-25T11:01:00.000Z	dark_light	needhel1	you should see direct rendering: Yes
2006-12-25T11:02:00.000Z	needhel1	dark_light	not really.... this is what I get: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/38776/
2006-12-25T11:05:00.000Z	dark_light	needhel1	see that link
