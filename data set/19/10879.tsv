2011-09-24T10:36:00.000Z	Petskull		Hey guys, I want to download some packages after my roomie steps out in about 3 hours.  How do I do that?  Do I have to set up a cron job or something?
2011-09-24T10:37:00.000Z	Petskull		basically I want to run 'sudo apt-get install xchat' at a certain time
2011-09-24T10:38:00.000Z	Flannel	Petskull	for one-time things like this, you can use 'at'
2011-09-24T10:42:00.000Z	Flannel	Petskull	sudo at now+3hour, then type your command, enter, ctrl-d.
2011-09-24T10:44:00.000Z	Flannel	Petskull	it won't run it in your shell, it'll just run it.
2011-09-24T10:44:00.000Z	Flannel	Petskull	after you add something, you can see it with 'atq'  (or sudo atq if you've added it to root's queue)
2011-09-24T10:45:00.000Z	Flannel	Petskull	gedit won't work.  It's not connected to 'you' at all.
2011-09-24T10:47:00.000Z	Flannel	Petskull	You can't do anything that interacts with the user.  Because it doesn't know which xserver to connect to, or which tty, etc, etc.
2011-09-24T10:48:00.000Z	Flannel	Petskull	that'll work.  Although I'd give both commands an absolute path.
2011-09-24T10:52:00.000Z	Flannel	Petskull	What exactly are you doing?
2011-09-24T10:54:00.000Z	Petskull	Flannel	I have this long line of packages I want to install on my new ubuntu machine.  I've used this line of apt a lot before
2011-09-24T10:55:00.000Z	Petskull	Flannel	does this make sense?
2011-09-24T10:56:00.000Z	Flannel	Petskull	No, no, what are you doing with at?
2011-09-24T10:58:00.000Z	Flannel	Petskull	What exactly are you doing (with your test case) to enter the line into at?
2011-09-24T11:00:00.000Z	Flannel	Petskull	That command works fine here to adding it to the at queue.
2011-09-24T11:01:00.000Z	Flannel	Petskull	No.
2011-09-24T11:01:00.000Z	Flannel	Petskull	Unless you feel like coming home to a broken system tomorrow.
2011-09-24T11:01:00.000Z	Flannel	Petskull	If you have to force it to yes, it's asking if you really want to do something you shouldn't.
2011-09-24T11:02:00.000Z	Flannel	Petskull	that's what -y does
