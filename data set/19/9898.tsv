2006-08-30T08:28:00.000Z	SiLV3R^2	jrib	 oculd you send again please, win sucks :D
2006-08-30T08:30:00.000Z	jrib	SiLV3R^2	when you select the partition, the bottom should say "Status", make sure that is enabled
2006-08-30T08:31:00.000Z	jrib	SiLV3R^2	this is in the system > administration > disks dialog
2006-08-30T08:31:00.000Z	SiLV3R^2	jrib	partition is disabled. but i can't activate it, becuase of "status: Inaccessible"
2006-08-30T08:31:00.000Z	SiLV3R^2	jrib	if i try to activat it doesn't work
2006-08-30T08:31:00.000Z	jrib	SiLV3R^2	does it give you an error?
2006-08-30T08:32:00.000Z	jrib	SiLV3R^2	ok, what filesystem does it use?  and what is its name? (/dev/hda6?)
2006-08-30T08:33:00.000Z	SiLV3R^2	jrib	name /dev/hda6 -- filesystem: extend 3
2006-08-30T08:34:00.000Z	jrib	SiLV3R^2	ok that is probably why, go into a terminal and do 'mkdir /media/hda6'.  That create the /media/hda6 directory, then use that is the access path and try to enable again
2006-08-30T08:34:00.000Z	jrib	SiLV3R^2	sorry, that should be 'sudo mkdir /media/hda6'
2006-08-30T08:35:00.000Z	jrib	SiLV3R^2	wait, why?
2006-08-30T08:36:00.000Z	jrib	SiLV3R^2	but mounting it on the livecd won't affect anything.  What are you trying to do?
2006-08-30T08:37:00.000Z	jrib	SiLV3R^2	or was this like a practice run?
2006-08-30T08:38:00.000Z	SiLV3R^2	jrib	so the main prob, ist that my hda6 is / (boot) partition and i can't boot ubuntu. just used the live cd to make those settings
2006-08-30T08:39:00.000Z	jrib	SiLV3R^2	oh ok, I didn't understand what you were doing
2006-08-30T08:40:00.000Z	SiLV3R^2	jrib	ok, what can i try now to make it work
2006-08-30T08:41:00.000Z	jrib	SiLV3R^2	not sure why mounting /dev/hda6 on the livecd would work but it complains during bootup
2006-08-30T08:42:00.000Z	jrib	SiLV3R^2	maybe NickRivers can help, I'm about to leave.  gl
2006-08-30T08:44:00.000Z	SiLV3R^2	jrib	thanks anyway :)
