2012-04-04T22:50:00.000Z	ikonia	aslan	depends how you configure them
2012-04-04T22:50:00.000Z	aslan	ikonia	could you explain me please.
2012-04-04T22:51:00.000Z	ikonia	aslan	you configure your guest OS's to get IP's from where you want
2012-04-04T22:51:00.000Z	aslan	ikonia	How to identify my IP address configuration
2012-04-04T22:52:00.000Z	ikonia	aslan	you put it on - so you know it
2012-04-04T22:52:00.000Z	aslan	ikonia	It shows that I'm using NAT for both the OS
2012-04-04T22:53:00.000Z	ikonia	aslan	ok, so you are natting out onto whatever network you've set it to nat from
2012-04-04T22:54:00.000Z	aslan	ikonia	NAT in the scene it is a kind of LAN which I' m getting the IP address for the primary OS to the guest OS.
