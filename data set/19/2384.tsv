2010-04-21T01:51:00.000Z	RikFshr		OK here's my boot issue
2010-04-21T01:51:00.000Z	RikFshr		Win 7 and Ubuntu 9.10 on a single drive
2010-04-21T01:51:00.000Z	RikFshr		 I was able to boot both then lost Ubuntu
2010-04-21T01:51:00.000Z	RikFshr		 Ran Super Grub .9799 and now can only boot Ubuntu
2010-04-21T01:51:00.000Z	RikFshr		 I used Super Grub to boot into Winerz but Sudo update-grub doesn't find the winderz install
2010-04-21T01:53:00.000Z	RikFshr		Hello everyone
2010-04-21T01:54:00.000Z	RikFshr		I have question about dual boot problem
2010-04-21T01:54:00.000Z	RikFshr		Win 7 and Ubuntu 9.10 on single drive
2010-04-21T01:55:00.000Z	RikFshr		Used Super Grub 0.9799 to fix Ubuntu boot problem and now Grub won't boot Windoze 7
2010-04-21T01:56:00.000Z	BluesKaj	RikFshr	did you do , sudo update-grub afterwards
2010-04-21T01:56:00.000Z	RikFshr		Any easy solution to restore windoze 7 to Grub boot options?
2010-04-21T01:56:00.000Z	RikFshr	BluesKaj	yes I did
2010-04-21T01:58:00.000Z	BluesKaj	RikFshr	i have to state the obvious, but sometimes the windows option becomes hidden at the bottom when there are too many old kernels filling up the the boot menu
2010-04-21T01:59:00.000Z	RikFshr		I removed all the clutter and have Main Ubuntu recovery and Memtest and something called chainloader that's all
2010-04-21T01:59:00.000Z	RikFshr		Sorry I don't know what you mean by pastebin
2010-04-21T02:00:00.000Z	RikFshr		I know what that file is
2010-04-21T02:01:00.000Z	RikFshr		OK thanks
2010-04-21T02:05:00.000Z	BluesKaj	RikFshr	actually the file to paste is:  /boot/grub/grub.cfg
