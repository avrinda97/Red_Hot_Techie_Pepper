2008-09-18T00:07:00.000Z	lashi		I have a fairly technical problem
2008-09-18T00:08:00.000Z	lashi		basically, as you all know, US airports are allowed to search people and their computers setc
2008-09-18T00:08:00.000Z	lashi		I'm going to be travelling through the US in 2 months
2008-09-18T00:08:00.000Z	lashi		I have about 16GB of music that I really don't want to discard
2008-09-18T00:08:00.000Z	lashi		I had an initial idea
2008-09-18T00:08:00.000Z	lashi		the idea was to burn a DVD of some of my photos, say so it takes up sectors 0 to 4000
2008-09-18T00:09:00.000Z	lashi		then fill 4001 to 4324 with /dev/random
2008-09-18T00:09:00.000Z	lashi		then have an XFS filesystem that's encrypted and "burn" that from 4325 to the end of the disc
2008-09-18T00:09:00.000Z	lashi		well, they won't know it's hidden
2008-09-18T00:09:00.000Z	lashi		the idea is, I have no idea if I could do that
2008-09-18T00:09:00.000Z	Scunizi	lashi	what? you have stuff that isn't legal? how would they know if it's not legal?
2008-09-18T00:10:00.000Z	lashi	Scunizi	they don't need to know that it isn't legal
2008-09-18T00:10:00.000Z	lashi		Especially as an Australian travelling through the US, we have to sign something called the "Visa Waiver"
2008-09-18T00:10:00.000Z	lashi		where we sign away our rights for stuff
2008-09-18T00:10:00.000Z	Scunizi	lashi	of course but how would they know in the first place.. they simply turn on the lappy to see if it actually functions.
2008-09-18T00:11:00.000Z	lashi		actually Scunizi, I've had some academic mates of mine travel from sweden
2008-09-18T00:11:00.000Z	lashi		they downloaded all their contents
2008-09-18T00:11:00.000Z	lashi		sorry ubottu, I didn't realise, I was wondering if ther were any experts in recording here
2008-09-18T00:11:00.000Z	Scunizi	lashi	weird.. but this really should be on #ubuntu-offtopic
