2006-01-13T09:37:00.000Z	Strat		I am using breezy.  Have an old dell with a Cirrus Logic CS4610/11
2006-01-13T09:37:00.000Z	Strat		Accordning to ALSA, it is supported
2006-01-13T09:38:00.000Z	Strat		lspci returns: 0000:00:0b.0 Multimedia audio controller: Cirrus Logic CS 4610/11 [CrystalClear SoundFusion Audio Accelerator]  (rev 01)
2006-01-13T09:39:00.000Z	Strat		The sound icon shows audio muted - if I try to turn in on I get an error that it can't find the device
2006-01-13T09:40:00.000Z	Strat		Error I get is: No volume control elements and / or devices found
2006-01-13T09:41:00.000Z	Strat		ok, this is where it starts to drive me crazy - alsamixer isn't there
2006-01-13T09:42:00.000Z	Strat		brand new install - only thing I have done is install the WMV support drivers
2006-01-13T09:42:00.000Z	Strat		the error I get when I run alsamixer: alsamixer: function snd_ctl_open failed for default: No such file or directory
2006-01-13T09:43:00.000Z	Strat		says its already there: alsa-utils is already the newest version.

2006-01-13T09:43:00.000Z	Goldfisch	Strat	Do you have alsa-utils installed? dpkg -l | grep alsa
2006-01-13T09:45:00.000Z	Strat	Goldfisch	- says alsa-base, utils, gstreamer0.8-also, libesd-alsa0 and plugins are there
2006-01-13T09:46:00.000Z	Goldfisch	Strat	My system has /usr/bin/alsamixer. You are saying you don't have that?
2006-01-13T09:51:00.000Z	Strat	Goldfisch	the actual error is: alsamixer: function snd_ctl_open failed for default: No such file or directory
2006-01-13T09:52:00.000Z	Goldfisch	Strat	I have typed that in to Google.com to see if anyone else has had a similar problem.
2006-01-13T09:57:00.000Z	Goldfisch	Strat	I did some poking around. NOthing real conclusive. All I can say is, you need to do the same. That is what google is there to help you with.
2006-01-13T09:58:00.000Z	Strat	Goldfisch	- I know.  I have spent four hours on this.
2006-01-13T09:58:00.000Z	Goldfisch	Strat	Kind of weird, but sometimes you need to walk away from tough problems and stop thinking about them. Then come back and attack them the next day. Sometimes it makes the answer fall right in front of you. :)
2006-01-13T10:02:00.000Z	Goldfisch	Strat	Uhh...patience? Sounds cheesy, I know. :p
