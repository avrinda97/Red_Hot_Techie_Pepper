2007-06-26T16:32:00.000Z	Catball		Hello, I had a couple of Ubuntu questions, not just due to accessibility quesitons, for the blind Linux user, but I wanted to ask a couple of questions here just to see if you folks could help.
2007-06-26T16:32:00.000Z	Catball		First,
2007-06-26T16:33:00.000Z	Catball		I know that Orca in Gnome 2.18 is the default screen-reading utility when used on the Ubuntu desktop. However, I also know that in Feisty itself, Ubuntu includes the Speakup screen reading kernel patched as modules to allow access to the console. Now, I have a couple of very spisific questions.
2007-06-26T16:34:00.000Z	Catball		I wanted to ask first of all, if it is possible to edit a run level system in Ubuntu desktop after installation, to insure that it boots strate away into the text console.
2007-06-26T16:35:00.000Z	Catball		Just in case you seriously do not feel like using Gnome at that moment, etc.
2007-06-26T16:35:00.000Z	wols_	Catball	of course it's possible
2007-06-26T16:37:00.000Z	wols_	Catball	64MB is the minimum requirement yes
2007-06-26T16:38:00.000Z	wols_	Catball	do you need a computer for a blind person and don't like frequent upgrades?
2007-06-26T16:39:00.000Z	wols_	Catball	the problem with linux on 64bit is proprietary stuff. flash, acrobat, proprietary drivers, etc. linux itself runs very very well under 64bit
2007-06-26T16:40:00.000Z	wols_	Catball	I'd use a distro with longe support cycles. ubuntu LTS, debian, RH, etc
2007-06-26T16:41:00.000Z	wols_	Catball	give him kde instead. and it depends a bit what your father uses
2007-06-26T16:42:00.000Z	wols_	Catball	as long as you do the admin stuff, any linus is usable for him imho
2007-06-26T16:42:00.000Z	wols_	Catball	you can also give him windows via vmware or WINE
2007-06-26T16:43:00.000Z	wols_	Catball	it will work too. it has mail, web and a text processing app. what more does he need?
2007-06-26T16:45:00.000Z	wols_	Catball	easily doable
2007-06-26T16:47:00.000Z	wols_	Catball	which debian did you use and when?
2007-06-26T16:49:00.000Z	wols_	Catball	it does. google for "dmix"
2007-06-26T16:57:00.000Z	wols_	Catball	look for a linux accessibility channel or better forum/mailinglist in gernal. not just ubuntu
2007-06-26T16:57:00.000Z	wols_	Catball	imho, with accessibility questions, the pools is too small so ask general questions and be prepared to do your won config work is best. better results than only relying on a distro
