2007-12-03T18:16:00.000Z	ubun00b		could someone test my ssh-connection? (ip: 84.48.58.62)
2007-12-03T18:16:00.000Z	ubun00b		user: toresn
2007-12-03T18:18:00.000Z	IdleOne	ubun00b	no response here either
2007-12-03T18:23:00.000Z	IdleOne	ubun00b	still nothing
2007-12-03T18:23:00.000Z	IdleOne	ubun00b	language please
2007-12-03T18:24:00.000Z	ubun00b	IdleOne	sorry, i'm very frustrated atm :)
2007-12-03T18:24:00.000Z	IdleOne	ubun00b	understandable but it does not help to curse and is rude. you are intelligent enough to find better ways of expressing your emotions :)
2007-12-03T18:27:00.000Z	ubun00b	IdleOne	is it possible for me to test this connection myself, by 'ssh user@my-ip-address' ?
2007-12-03T18:27:00.000Z	ubun00b	IdleOne	so i don't have to bother you guys each time i need to test it
2007-12-03T18:28:00.000Z	IdleOne	ubun00b	that might work but you wouldnt know if anybody outside your network can connect. have you open ports on your router?
2007-12-03T18:28:00.000Z	ubun00b	IdleOne	that's what i'm working on... opening port 22 on my router
2007-12-03T18:29:00.000Z	IdleOne	ubun00b	get that port open and then let me know when you got it I will test with you
2007-12-03T18:29:00.000Z	ubun00b	IdleOne	oki
2007-12-03T19:44:00.000Z	ubun00b	IdleOne	could you try one last time? if it doesn't work this time i'm giving up for the day :-)
2007-12-03T19:46:00.000Z	ubun00b	IdleOne	ahh, great! thank you :)
2007-12-03T19:46:00.000Z	IdleOne	ubun00b	np
2010-08-26T21:32:00.000Z	IdleOne	ubun00b	Do the drivers provided by Ubuntu work ?
2010-08-26T21:37:00.000Z	IdleOne	ubun00b	yes :)
2010-08-26T21:40:00.000Z	IdleOne	ubun00b	see the second link ubottu just gave you
