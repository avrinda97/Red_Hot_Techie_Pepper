2007-05-14T13:54:00.000Z	zaggynl		What's the difference between /usr/bin and /usr/sbin ?
2007-05-14T13:54:00.000Z	zaggynl		gl hf Gruelius
2007-05-14T13:54:00.000Z	pv2b	zaggynl	/usr/sbin contains utilities typically only used by administrators
2007-05-14T13:54:00.000Z	zaggynl		ah okay, thanks
2007-05-14T13:54:00.000Z	zaggynl		I just downloaded this poweriso commandline tool, I'll put it in /usr/bin then
2007-05-14T13:55:00.000Z	pv2b	zaggynl	you probably want to put it in /usr/local/bin
2007-05-14T13:55:00.000Z	zaggynl	pv2b	how so?
2007-05-14T13:55:00.000Z	pv2b	zaggynl	on debian-based systems, you typically keep files that are managed by debian packages in /usr/bin et cetera
2007-05-14T13:56:00.000Z	zaggynl		ah okay
2007-05-14T13:56:00.000Z	zaggynl		so 'loose' programs should be put in /usr/local/bin
2007-05-14T13:56:00.000Z	pv2b	zaggynl	for stuff built from source code or installed otherwise outside the .deb system, you should put them in /usr/local somewhere /usr/local/bin for a binary for example
2007-05-14T13:56:00.000Z	pv2b		yeah
2007-05-14T13:56:00.000Z	pv2b		it might already be in your path
2007-05-14T13:56:00.000Z	zaggynl		will do, thanks for the info
2007-05-14T13:56:00.000Z	pv2b		echo $PATH and find out
2007-05-14T13:57:00.000Z	pv2b	zaggynl	it's more a convention than a loose rule, really
2007-05-14T13:57:00.000Z	pv2b		s/loose/strict/
2007-05-14T13:59:00.000Z	pv2b	zaggynl	i'm not sure how compliant Ubuntu specifically is with the FHS, but that's one standard that is pretty close to, if not entirely in line with what ubuntu does.
2007-05-14T14:00:00.000Z	pv2b	zaggynl	take a look at http://www.pathname.com/fhs/ -- as i said, it might not be completely accurate for ubuntu, but the basics should be correct
