2008-10-20T07:04:00.000Z	hitman1985		hi everyone, whats the best way to setup a house internal remote desktop viewer (got a server (winxp) what i need to control) from ubuntu 8.04 hardy heron
2008-10-20T07:05:00.000Z	the_lost_one	hitman1985	i use remote admin under wine
2008-10-20T07:05:00.000Z	hitman1985	the_lost_one	think teamviewer will run under wine ?
2008-10-20T07:06:00.000Z	hitman1985	the_lost_one	never liked radmin :(
2008-10-20T07:06:00.000Z	the_lost_one	hitman1985	haha, good question, let me check it
2008-10-20T07:06:00.000Z	hitman1985	the_lost_one	no need runing now
2008-10-20T07:06:00.000Z	hitman1985	the_lost_one	just didnt remember i had wine tho ;) easier things are always  the worst to realize
2008-10-20T07:08:00.000Z	the_lost_one	hitman1985	yeah, working like a charm :-)
2008-10-20T07:08:00.000Z	hitman1985	the_lost_one	just surprises me that they dont have a linux version yet, that is actually bad points for them from my position :)
2008-10-20T07:09:00.000Z	hitman1985	the_lost_one	thanks im still dling it :)
2008-10-20T07:09:00.000Z	the_lost_one	hitman1985	100% agree :(
2008-10-20T07:10:00.000Z	hitman1985	the_lost_one	 i started with linux about 3 month ago, and i got all my work apps runing on ubuntu so far, wont go back for work to M$
2008-10-20T07:10:00.000Z	the_lost_one	hitman1985	but hey, now whe have first wine estable, and its awesome ow good works
2008-10-20T07:10:00.000Z	the_lost_one	hitman1985	yeah, thats the idea haha
2008-10-20T07:11:00.000Z	hitman1985	the_lost_one	wine is nice and neat but i still prefer to have the ubuntu repos involved rather then runing "mounted" stuff
2008-10-20T07:12:00.000Z	the_lost_one	hitman1985	of course, but, for work, i must use some stupid stuff like radmin, and i must get it working hehe
2008-10-20T07:13:00.000Z	hitman1985	the_lost_one	im planing on having the ubuntu tower as work machine, pleasure / gaming i use xp and media center will be xp as well :( cuz linux is just not as good in media playback options yet in my opinion
2008-10-20T07:13:00.000Z	the_lost_one	hitman1985	hey.. which ones have you tried?
2008-10-20T07:15:00.000Z	the_lost_one	hitman1985	tell us your story then huh? :-)
