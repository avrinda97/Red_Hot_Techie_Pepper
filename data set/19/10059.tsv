2006-11-01T15:53:00.000Z	noxxle		i was also wondering if its possible to defrag an external usb harddrive that has formated to fat32 from ubuntu?
2006-11-01T15:54:00.000Z	soundray	noxxle	the best way to defrag is to back up, format and restore.
2006-11-01T15:55:00.000Z	noxxle	soundray	are u joking?
2006-11-01T15:56:00.000Z	soundray	noxxle	no
2006-11-01T15:57:00.000Z	soundray	noxxle	if you haven't got a way to backup your 150GB, you're not following best practice, anyway. Get a backup drive.
2006-11-01T15:58:00.000Z	soundray	noxxle	especially if you're entrusting your data to a flaky filesystem like fat32
2006-11-01T16:00:00.000Z	soundray	noxxle	then backup, format *to ext3*, restore, and never worry about defragging again.
2006-11-01T16:00:00.000Z	soundray	noxxle	no
2006-11-01T16:01:00.000Z	soundray	noxxle	feel free to try with Partition Magic. Most likely, it's going to mess things up. Backup, format... I've said it before.
2006-11-01T16:10:00.000Z	soundray	noxxle	mabus, iter: please ask yourselves whether your discussion is still on topic.
