2008-06-29T18:55:00.000Z	amikrop		How can I see which packages do I lack as dependencies, for a certain package to install?
2008-06-29T18:56:00.000Z	IdleOne	amikrop	synaptic will list them for you when you choose to install a package and ask if you want them marked for installation
2008-06-29T18:56:00.000Z	amikrop	IdleOne	I ask, because the system that lacks those dependencies has no Internet connection.
2008-06-29T18:58:00.000Z	IdleOne	amikrop	you can also check on packges.ubuntu.com dowload the packages you need and then move them to the machine with no internet and use dpkg -i package-name to install
2008-06-29T18:58:00.000Z	amikrop	IdleOne	The things is that I need to recursively get all of the dependencies of the dependencies of the depen... etc.
2008-06-29T19:00:00.000Z	IdleOne	amikrop	well that could be thousands of packages even tens of thousands. might be better off just giving internet access to that machine
2008-06-29T19:00:00.000Z	amikrop	IdleOne	How? ueagle-atm modem did not work, not even the dialup modem.
2008-06-29T19:03:00.000Z	IdleOne	amikrop	you are on the internet now. go to packages.ubuntu.com and download the packages you need. burn them to cd. put the cd in the ubuntu machine with no internet and install the packages
2008-06-29T19:04:00.000Z	IdleOne	amikrop	seems it is right now
2008-06-29T19:06:00.000Z	amikrop	IdleOne	mnemo: OK. Let's say I want to install build-essential to a freshly installed system (no internet connection, no packages installed apart from the default ones). What packages would I need to download, to install build-essential to that machine?
2008-06-29T19:07:00.000Z	IdleOne	amikrop	build-essential is a meta-package. ( a list ) it download several other packages and installs them. you need to download build-essential and the package manager does the rest
2008-06-29T19:10:00.000Z	amikrop	IdleOne	Again, I don't have an Internet connection at the target system, so I have to download the packages manually from here (another Ubuntu system).
2008-06-29T19:10:00.000Z	IdleOne	amikrop	burn the packages to a cd. this is the third time I tell you. then move the cd to the other machine and install
2008-06-29T19:11:00.000Z	amikrop	IdleOne	Yes, I asked *which* packages?
2008-06-29T19:11:00.000Z	IdleOne	amikrop	build-essential
2008-06-29T19:12:00.000Z	amikrop	IdleOne	Only? But that is a metapackage.
2008-06-29T19:13:00.000Z	IdleOne	amikrop	packages.ubuntu.com is down ATM but it does list what packages are included or needed . ( not sure how to word it ) on the site
2008-06-29T19:13:00.000Z	amikrop	IdleOne	OK. Let's hope it comes back fast.
2008-06-29T19:13:00.000Z	IdleOne	amikrop	it should
