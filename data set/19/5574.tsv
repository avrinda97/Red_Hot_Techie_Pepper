2008-08-03T09:08:00.000Z	evilGUI		ok so I get it to install kubuntu and it fails brings me to a black screen then it restarts
2008-08-03T09:08:00.000Z	evilGUI		now my mouse is all laggy in windows
2008-08-03T09:09:00.000Z	evilGUI		and firefox seems to reinstalled it self
2008-08-03T09:10:00.000Z	evilGUI		wonder why kubuntu would just stop during the install...
2008-08-03T09:10:00.000Z	evilGUI		I'm installing it through wubi
2008-08-03T09:11:00.000Z	evilGUI		also is it even possible that it messed with windows
2008-08-03T09:13:00.000Z	evilGUI		mabye linux doesn't work on my system?
2008-08-03T09:13:00.000Z	unavailable	evilGUI	maybe you should ditch wubi and try installing the normal way?
2008-08-03T09:14:00.000Z	unavailable	evilGUI	mind you AFTER A FULL SCANDISK AND DEFRAG of windows
2008-08-03T09:14:00.000Z	unavailable	evilGUI	order a free cd then
2008-08-03T09:15:00.000Z	unavailable	evilGUI	it takes about 2 weeks and comes with stickers
2008-08-03T09:15:00.000Z	unavailable	evilGUI	or you could go that route, and if you dont have a usb stick,  heh, use a camera
2008-08-03T09:16:00.000Z	unavailable	evilGUI	you have a digicam or ipod or psp?
2008-08-03T09:17:00.000Z	unavailable	evilGUI	1 gb is > 700 megs
2008-08-03T09:19:00.000Z	unavailable	evilGUI	its worth a try, if you can get your ipod bootable with the iso contents (not the iso itself, but you probably know that) on it you can run livecd from there
2008-08-03T09:25:00.000Z	unavailable	evilGUI	as long as you manually do the partition editing you *should* not run into problems (provided you know what youre doing)
2008-08-03T09:26:00.000Z	unavailable	evilGUI	again before you do anything...   SCANDISK DEFRAG SCANDISK
2008-08-03T09:27:00.000Z	unavailable	evilGUI	during the install process (unless you have a partition ready for ubuntu) you are going to be asked to make one
2008-08-03T09:32:00.000Z	unavailable	evilGUI	yes, but again you must choose wisely at the right screen >> see the manual partitoning https://help.ubuntu.com/8.04/installation-guide/i386/module-details.html#di-partition
