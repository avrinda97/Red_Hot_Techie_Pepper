2011-01-25T20:57:00.000Z	devios		hey all - i could really use some help here - I have an Ubuntu Intrepid server running inside of a colocation facility.  I want to upgrade it to current version.  Is it in any way possible to do remotely given Intrepid is EOL'd?
2011-01-25T20:58:00.000Z	TheFuzzball	devios	/etc/apt/sources.list and apt-get dist-upgrade
2011-01-25T20:59:00.000Z	devios	TheFuzzball	where do I go to get the /etc/apt/sources.list file contents?
2011-01-25T21:00:00.000Z	TheFuzzball	devios	do sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list and replace intrepid with maverick
2011-01-25T21:01:00.000Z	TheFuzzball	devios	but Intrepid is very old, I don't know how well it will work, upgrading over that many versions...
2011-01-25T21:01:00.000Z	devios	TheFuzzball	ya this could get very ugly very fast, eh?
2011-01-25T21:01:00.000Z	devios	TheFuzzball	since I cant keep Intrepid secure and up-to-date, what do I have to lose, right?
2011-01-25T21:02:00.000Z	TheFuzzball	devios	are you doing this in a production environment?
2011-01-25T21:03:00.000Z	devios	TheFuzzball	sort of - nothing that cant be redeployed easily
2011-01-25T21:03:00.000Z	devios	TheFuzzball	backing up everything important now
2011-01-25T21:04:00.000Z	TheFuzzball	devios	OK, do: sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list and replace all instances of intrepid with maverick
2011-01-25T21:04:00.000Z	TheFuzzball	devios	then do sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
2011-01-25T21:04:00.000Z	devios	TheFuzzball	thx - gotta finish this backup first since it's hioghly likely this thing is gonna brick.
2011-01-25T21:04:00.000Z	TheFuzzball	devios	If anything fails do sudo apt-get -f install
2011-01-25T21:05:00.000Z	devios	TheFuzzball	I'll post the modified sources.list file to a pastebin before I do it
2011-01-25T21:06:00.000Z	TheFuzzball	devios	I can't predict what will happen, dist-upgrade is usually fine from one release to another, but I've never done it across 4 releases...
2011-01-25T21:40:00.000Z	TheFuzzball	devios	np
2011-01-25T21:40:00.000Z	devios	TheFuzzball	indeed - on debian systems, you can set up the sources.list file in such a way that it is release agnostic - just have to manually do dist-upgrade every one in a while.  it's awesome.
2011-01-25T21:42:00.000Z	TheFuzzball	devios	arch linux is best for rolling release
