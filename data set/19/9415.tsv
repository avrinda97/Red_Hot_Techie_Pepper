2007-03-16T12:15:00.000Z	h1st0		All ubuntu machines have nano
2007-03-16T12:16:00.000Z	h1st0		Who ever came up with the default keys for vim should be shot.
2007-03-16T12:16:00.000Z	cafuego_	h1st0	why?
2007-03-16T12:16:00.000Z	cafuego_		:x
2007-03-16T12:16:00.000Z	cafuego_		:ZZ
2007-03-16T12:16:00.000Z	cafuego_		Actually, no, just 'ZZ'
2007-03-16T12:17:00.000Z	h1st0		The scroll keys etc...
2007-03-16T12:17:00.000Z	cafuego_	h1st0	the arrow keys work if your terminal type isn't broken.
2007-03-16T12:18:00.000Z	h1st0	cafuego_	I must be thinking of anothe reditor but still the whole : stuff is assinine
2007-03-16T12:18:00.000Z	h1st0	cafuego_	nano's interface is so much more user friendly.  Still not perfect but better.
2007-03-16T12:19:00.000Z	cafuego_	h1st0	nano is far too slow and limited
2007-03-16T12:19:00.000Z	h1st0		They could have ctrl+x at the bottom instead of ^X etc...
2007-03-16T12:19:00.000Z	h1st0	cafuego_	for a text editor?
2007-03-16T12:19:00.000Z	cafuego_		I don't know if it can even do a conditional regex search & replace.
2007-03-16T12:20:00.000Z	h1st0	cafuego_	use sed for that.
2007-03-16T12:20:00.000Z	cafuego_	h1st0	Yah
2007-03-16T12:20:00.000Z	cafuego_	h1st0	I don't want to have to save, exit, run sed, reopen.
2007-03-16T12:20:00.000Z	h1st0	cafuego_	^W
2007-03-16T12:21:00.000Z	h1st0	cafuego_	actually ^\
