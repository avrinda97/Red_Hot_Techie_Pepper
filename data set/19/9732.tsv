2008-08-17T21:52:00.000Z	wols_	shooters	your kernel logs as I said
2008-08-17T21:42:00.000Z	wols_	shooters	what network chip?
2008-08-17T21:43:00.000Z	shooters	wols_	Broadcom, I've tried using b43 and ndiswrapper, but neither is working
2008-08-17T21:44:00.000Z	shooters	wols_	the light turns on and "Wireless network" displays on Network Manager, but no network appears in the list, no drivers seems to be loaded when I "lshw" and I can't connect to anything... Moreover, Network Manager says in the log "eth1: Device is fully-supported using driver '(null')"
2008-08-17T21:45:00.000Z	wols_	shooters	lshw doesn't load drivers. are any drivers loaded and what is in your logs?
2008-08-17T21:46:00.000Z	shooters	wols_	modprobe tells me b43 is loaded
2008-08-17T21:46:00.000Z	wols_	shooters	lsmod should tell you, not modprobe. and I asked about logs
2008-08-17T21:48:00.000Z	shooters	wols_	http://paste.ubuntu.com/38266/
2008-08-17T21:49:00.000Z	wols_	shooters	that's only part of what I asked about
2008-08-17T21:51:00.000Z	shooters	wols_	http://paste.ubuntu.com/38267/
2008-08-17T21:52:00.000Z	wols_	shooters	that's only one log. there are more
2008-08-17T21:52:00.000Z	shooters	wols_	what logs do you want, all of them?
2008-08-17T21:57:00.000Z	shooters	wols_	http://paste.ubuntu.com/38268/
2008-08-17T22:02:00.000Z	shooters	wols_	do you need more information?
2008-08-17T22:03:00.000Z	wols_	shooters	looks alright. I'd stop using gnome network manager and use wireless-tools instead, iwconfig, iwspy, etc
2008-08-17T22:03:00.000Z	shooters	wols_	iwlist doesn't return any networks either.
2008-08-17T22:03:00.000Z	wols_	shooters	any errors?
2008-08-17T22:04:00.000Z	shooters	wols_	"no scan results"
2008-08-17T22:09:00.000Z	shooters	wols_	Is it normal that ifconfig -a displays a "wmaster0" interface?
