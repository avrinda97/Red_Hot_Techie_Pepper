2007-09-18T07:02:00.000Z	IdleOne	runemaste644	there is alot of chatter in this room to avoid adding to it use /msg ubotu xorg
2007-09-18T07:03:00.000Z	IdleOne	runemaste644	you should now have a tab named ubotu click on it and ubotu will give you the info it can. use that window for subsequent searches

2007-09-18T07:10:00.000Z	IdleOne	runemaste644	what is wubi?
2007-09-18T07:10:00.000Z	runemaste644	IdleOne	It installs Ubuntu on a virtual disk
2007-09-18T07:10:00.000Z	runemaste644	IdleOne	Sort of like VirtualBox
2007-09-18T07:11:00.000Z	runemaste644	IdleOne	what do you mean EWWWW!?
2007-09-18T07:12:00.000Z	runemaste644	IdleOne	It works fine and I used it cuz i couldnt ditch WInblows
2007-09-18T07:12:00.000Z	IdleOne	runemaste644	dont see why anyone would want a Virtual Ubuntu setup when the Real thing is great
2007-09-18T07:13:00.000Z	runemaste644	IdleOne	& Pelo: You actually dual boot, not a virtual machine. It edits boot.lst and you have a half real install. You can also use LVPM to make it a real install
2007-09-18T07:14:00.000Z	IdleOne	runemaste644	yeah I get that but I dont have any need for windows. anything I need to do I can do with linux
