2011-11-16T03:00:00.000Z	SushiDude|Laptop		Can someone tell me why the default permissions for the home folders of new users that you add are messed up?
2011-11-16T03:01:00.000Z	SushiDude|Laptop		okay
2011-11-16T03:01:00.000Z	SushiDude|Laptop		wait
2011-11-16T03:02:00.000Z	SushiDude|Laptop		I am running Ubuntu 11.10, when I create a new user(users other then the one made when you first installed) the permissions of the home directory are set to all others to view the files
2011-11-16T03:02:00.000Z	SushiDude|Laptop		It should not be like that
2011-11-16T03:03:00.000Z	SushiDude|Laptop		Thats crazy!
2011-11-16T03:03:00.000Z	SushiDude|Laptop		I could just look at the users private info
2011-11-16T03:04:00.000Z	SushiDude|Laptop		It is a pretty big flaw =\
2011-11-16T03:04:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	SushiDude|Laptop	I agree with you, but this was already discussed and the Technical Board made a deliberate decision to do it that way.  You can change it for your machine, of course.
2011-11-16T03:04:00.000Z	SushiDude|Laptop	tonyyarusso	why did they do that on purpose!?!
2011-11-16T03:05:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	SushiDude|Laptop	Because the average user wants to be able to share their files with their family and doesn't understand the concept of permissions to know why it doesn't work otherwise, basically.
2011-11-16T03:08:00.000Z	SushiDude|Laptop	tonyyarusso	is there any other _very_ important security things that you left out of Ubuntu because of that and/or a similar reason?
2011-11-16T03:09:00.000Z	SushiDude|Laptop	tonyyarusso	because I want to know so I can fix it on my system =
2011-11-16T03:11:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	SushiDude|Laptop	*I* didn't leave anything out of Ubuntu - I'm not a developer.  But what sort of things do you mean?
2011-11-16T03:11:00.000Z	SushiDude|Laptop	tonyyarusso	anything like that... I file permissions are very important
2011-11-16T03:12:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	SushiDude|Laptop	Oh, I see - you're just wondering.  The next thing that comes to mind is that Ubuntu no longer has a "Zero open ports" policy, since there's one for Avahi (zeroconf), although that's not really a big deal.
2011-11-16T03:14:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	SushiDude|Laptop	Ctrl-Alt-Del for reboot works by default on a console, so you may want to disable that if you're concerned about physical access issues on a server.
2011-11-16T03:18:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	SushiDude|Laptop	Most Ubuntu users fall into one of two categories:  1) Home users, where the default makes sense.  2) Server administrators, who shouldn't just be blindly accepting defaults anyway.  So while I'm not a big fan of the policy, it does kidn of make sense.
2011-11-16T03:27:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	SushiDude|Laptop	Which makes more sense - you, who understands permissions, needing to change them from the default, or the average user, who does not, needing to change them from the default?  I mean come on now.
