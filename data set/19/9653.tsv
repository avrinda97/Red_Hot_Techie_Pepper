2007-01-18T09:25:00.000Z	leal	kitche	wmd is a python script...

2007-01-18T09:25:00.000Z	leal	kitche	or something like that...
2007-01-18T09:26:00.000Z	kitche	leal	you need to download it seperate probably I'm reading their website
2007-01-18T09:26:00.000Z	leal	kitche	i did download the python-bluez, but it depends on python-central...
2007-01-18T09:27:00.000Z	leal	kitche	python-central conflicts with ubuntu-help.
2007-01-18T09:27:00.000Z	leal	kitche	sorry, deb-helper...
