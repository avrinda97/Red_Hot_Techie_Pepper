2009-05-13T03:31:00.000Z	Brack10		I'm on the Ubuntu livecd that I installed on my USB key.... when I reboot all changes I made to the filesystem are reset, despite / being mounted as rw.....what can I do so that it keeps my changes?
2009-05-13T03:32:00.000Z	Titan8990	Brack10	it is rw but its your ram which is volatile
2009-05-13T03:32:00.000Z	Brack10	Titan8990	So is this posible?
2009-05-13T03:33:00.000Z	Titan8990	Brack10	livecds/usb don't use the cd or usb for the filesystem, it loads a squashfs into the ram
2009-05-13T03:33:00.000Z	Titan8990	Brack10	for persistant change usb?
2009-05-13T03:33:00.000Z	Brack10	Titan8990	I see...so then use a CD to install to the USB?
2009-05-13T03:33:00.000Z	Titan8990	Brack10	that should work
2009-05-13T03:33:00.000Z	Titan8990	Brack10	although I know there are other ways to do it
2009-05-13T03:34:00.000Z	Brack10	Titan8990	Any foreseeable booting issues?
2009-05-13T03:34:00.000Z	Brack10		BTW 9.10 on USB FTMFW
2009-05-13T03:34:00.000Z	Titan8990	Brack10	do you have grub on your internal hdd?
2009-05-13T03:34:00.000Z	Brack10		compiz works out of the box
2009-05-13T03:34:00.000Z	Brack10	Titan8990	not yet...
2009-05-13T03:34:00.000Z	Brack10		booted up in like 20 seconds
2009-05-13T03:34:00.000Z	Brack10		very satisfied
2009-05-13T03:34:00.000Z	Titan8990	Brack10	you will just have to manually select the usb from the bios boot menu
2009-05-13T03:35:00.000Z	Brack10	Titan8990	Okey dok...thanks
2009-05-13T03:35:00.000Z	Titan8990	Brack10	make sure you don't write grub to the internal
