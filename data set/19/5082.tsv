2008-09-05T07:15:00.000Z	luqui		I'm trying to remove nautilus from my gnome session (by setting its style to trash), but it keeps coming back!
2008-09-05T07:16:00.000Z	luqui		i.e. set its style to trash, log out, log back in (and it's not there), log out, log back in (it's back!)
2008-09-05T07:16:00.000Z	luqui		how do I get rid of it!?
2008-09-05T07:18:00.000Z	luqui		anybody?
2008-09-05T07:19:00.000Z	Slade	luqui	how are you setting its style to trash? and also, is this a theme?
2008-09-05T07:19:00.000Z	luqui	Slade	using gnome-session-properties
2008-09-05T07:19:00.000Z	luqui	Slade	is what a theme?
2008-09-05T07:20:00.000Z	Slade	luqui	your nautilus style. Did you download it from gnome-look.org or something similar?
2008-09-05T07:20:00.000Z	luqui	Slade	... nautilus... style?   I did install a theme, maybe that's it.  But I think it's just a gtk theme.
2008-09-05T07:21:00.000Z	Slade	luqui	you may want to try using another theme and see if it fixes the problem. if it does, you may even know where to go from there so you can use the previous theme without it affecting nautilus.
2008-09-05T07:21:00.000Z	luqui	Slade	okay thanks
2008-09-05T07:22:00.000Z	Slade	luqui	no problem. If you're trying to get rid of nautilus all together, what do you plan to use?
2008-09-05T07:22:00.000Z	luqui	Slade	xmonad ;-)
2008-09-05T07:23:00.000Z	Slade	luqui	your other option, tho IMO undesirable is to uninstall nautilus and install xmonad. Create a symbolic link of xmonad and call it nautilus.
2008-09-05T07:23:00.000Z	luqui		eeeeeewwwwwwww
2008-09-05T07:23:00.000Z	Slade	luqui	ie: ln -s /usr/bin/xmonad /usr/bin/nautilus
2008-09-05T07:23:00.000Z	luqui		yeah, first, that's system wide, and second, eeww :-)
2008-09-05T07:24:00.000Z	luqui		trying your suggestion Slade
2008-09-05T07:24:00.000Z	Slade	luqui	hence why i said undesirable :)
