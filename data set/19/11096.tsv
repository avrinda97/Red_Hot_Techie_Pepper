2006-07-28T14:48:00.000Z	sanmarcos	ic56	I was trying to find out where the partition was
2006-07-28T14:50:00.000Z	ic56	sanmarcos	Yes, I realize that.  Remember that fdisk -l is essentially equivalent to cat /proc/partitions .  If the kernel cannot autodetect teh partition table for a disk, it doesn't show up there and you have to fall back on personal knowledge of the hardware layout
2006-07-28T14:50:00.000Z	sanmarcos	ic56	yeah, but he should try reformating the whole disk again, and if it doesnt work then just throw it away, or maybe windows can do some voodoo to get it to work, though i doubt it
2006-07-28T14:52:00.000Z	ic56	sanmarcos	by reformatting, you imply partitioning, right?
2006-07-28T14:52:00.000Z	sanmarcos	ic56	no, just wiping the whole disk with dd, then creating a 100% vfat partition on it
2006-07-28T14:53:00.000Z	ic56	sanmarcos	yeah, so long as you do create a partition, it can be autodetected.  If you don't partition, the kernel cannot autodetect.
2006-07-28T14:54:00.000Z	sanmarcos	ic56	i am not sure it works quite that way, its not the kernel that mounts your thumb drive automatically
2006-07-28T14:55:00.000Z	sanmarcos	ic56	the kernel will recognize the usb device, then it will try to use scsi emulation for the whatever volumes there are on it. Its a combination of hal/udev/dbus and gnome-volume-manager that makes the magic work
2006-07-28T14:55:00.000Z	ic56	sanmarcos	for example, my /dev/hdb contains a single filesystem.  There is not /dev/hdb1 There is no partition table.  Just one big filesystem starting at block 0.  mount -l doesn't report that drive.
2006-07-28T14:56:00.000Z	sanmarcos	ic56	really? It has to have a main partition, it should be /dev/hdb1 what you mount, not /dev/hdb as it is the device itself
2006-07-28T15:06:00.000Z	ic56	sanmarcos	you may be right.  Then again, we never found out if his partition table was corrupt.  The electronics may be fine -- just the formatting data may be corrupt.
2006-07-28T14:57:00.000Z	ic56	sanmarcos	yes, I mount /dev/hdb directly.  I'm cheap!
2006-07-28T14:59:00.000Z	sanmarcos	ic56	well I would guess the devs would have made it so that devices with a single partition are able to use such shortcut
2006-07-28T15:00:00.000Z	sanmarcos	ic56	but its better to use /dev/hdb1 and get used to the numbers. You wouldnt want to confuse yourself when doing risky stuff (dd, file systems, partitions, fdisk) etc.
2006-07-28T15:03:00.000Z	ic56	sanmarcos	no special code is needed to make /dev/hdb work as a filesystem.  /dev/hdb is just raw disk sectors /dev/hdb1 is more raw disk sectors but beginning at an offset specified by the partition table.  I agree that it's better to advise newbies to partition, then format a filesystem.  Which is why I was surprised when you said to format the whole disk.
2006-07-28T15:04:00.000Z	sanmarcos	ic56	:) anyways I think that thumb drive is doomed anyways.. they are so cheap these days, and flash memory isnt exaclty durable
2006-07-28T15:06:00.000Z	sanmarcos	ic56	indeed.. Gparted could easily fix that
2006-07-28T15:07:00.000Z	ic56	sanmarcos	agreed
2006-07-28T15:10:00.000Z	sanmarcos	ic56	totally dude
