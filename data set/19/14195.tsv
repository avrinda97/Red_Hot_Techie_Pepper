2006-08-05T12:12:00.000Z	p3980		Hello all... have a question for you
2006-08-05T12:12:00.000Z	p3980		Mind taking a shot at it?
2006-08-05T12:12:00.000Z	p3980		Apparentally not
2006-08-05T12:13:00.000Z	p3980		OK, simply enough, whenever I'm on one of the virtual terminals (accessed by Alt+F[somenumberhere] , the top inch or so of the screen ends up on the bottom
2006-08-05T12:13:00.000Z	Seveas	p3980	freaky
2006-08-05T12:13:00.000Z	p3980		Yes
2006-08-05T12:13:00.000Z	Seveas		which video card?
2006-08-05T12:13:00.000Z	p3980		Nvidia, unsure of exact model number as the computer isn't mine and they won't let me take it apart
2006-08-05T12:14:00.000Z	Seveas		have you tried the proprietary drivers?
2006-08-05T12:14:00.000Z	p3980		Yes, they're installed
2006-08-05T12:14:00.000Z	p3980		IIRC, I think I may have forgot to run the config command to tell X to use those drivers
2006-08-05T12:14:00.000Z	p3980		ok
2006-08-05T12:14:00.000Z	Seveas	p3980	sudo nvidia-glx-config enable
2006-08-05T12:14:00.000Z	Seveas		!language > twotwenty
2006-08-05T12:15:00.000Z	p3980	frogzoo	I'll try it
2006-08-05T12:16:00.000Z	p3980		what did you want me to pass to /boot/grub/menu.lst again?
2006-08-05T12:17:00.000Z	p3980		thank you
2006-08-05T12:18:00.000Z	p3980		do I need to uncomment the #kopt line?
2006-08-05T12:18:00.000Z	Seveas	p3980	no, you MUST leave it commented
