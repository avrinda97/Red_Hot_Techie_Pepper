2012-05-23T12:24:00.000Z	Onkeltem		I need to get Google Chrome 18th version. Where/how can I get it?
2012-05-23T12:24:00.000Z	Onkeltem		It is now autoupdated to 19, which is crap for me
2012-05-23T12:25:00.000Z	Onkeltem		How to roll it back??
2012-05-23T12:25:00.000Z	RawChid	Onkeltem	I thought Google Chrome updates itself 'undER The hood'
2012-05-23T12:27:00.000Z	Onkeltem	RawChid	well, I need somehow to browse and get old deb
2012-05-23T12:30:00.000Z	RawChid	Onkeltem	maybe this helps http://askubuntu.com/questions/92019/how-to-install-specific-ubuntu-packages-with-exact-version
2012-05-23T12:31:00.000Z	Onkeltem	RawChid	for this I should know the exact version of the package
2012-05-23T12:31:00.000Z	Onkeltem	RawChid	which is not the case. For example, current version is called: 19.0.1084.46-r135956
2012-05-23T12:33:00.000Z	RawChid	Onkeltem	I understand. Sorry can't help you with that.
2012-05-23T12:41:00.000Z	Onkeltem	RawChid	disaster. They deleted the version I found in logs ( 18.0.1025.168-r134367 ) :((
2012-05-23T12:42:00.000Z	Onkeltem	RawChid	would you paste a link to the repo you are using for Chrome?
2012-05-23T12:42:00.000Z	Onkeltem	RawChid	for chromium I meant
2012-05-23T12:43:00.000Z	Onkeltem	RawChid	because some malicious bastard made a change which had led to Autosave Extension stopped working from 19 and over
2012-05-23T12:44:00.000Z	Onkeltem	RawChid	ok, I'll check it
2012-05-23T12:44:00.000Z	Onkeltem	RawChid	until it start working again. Imagine, you moved all your development to some tool, and then it stopped working
2012-05-23T12:45:00.000Z	RawChid	Onkeltem	I see
2012-05-23T12:45:00.000Z	Onkeltem	RawChid	Autosave, to say truth, is saving hours per week, not to say its much more convinient to, keeing editing CSS/JavaScript on your fingertips
2012-05-23T12:47:00.000Z	Onkeltem	RawChid	I now confirm I see 18th of Chromium in stable. Thank you
2012-05-23T12:58:00.000Z	Onkeltem	RawChid	huh, feeling much warmer now. Installed Chromium, copied all Chrome personal stuff, things run smooth.
