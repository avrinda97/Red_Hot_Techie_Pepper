2010-05-02T20:36:00.000Z	s0ja		hey i just found out there is now xorg.conf in lucid - how do I get compiz on my gma 950 now!?
2010-05-02T20:38:00.000Z	Jowi	s0ja	it's supported but not really needed. Go to System > Preferences > Appearance > Visual effects and click in the "Normal" box if you can.
2010-05-02T20:38:00.000Z	s0ja	Jowi	It says looking for driver if I do that, then it stays on normal, when I reopen the dialogue it's back on standard
2010-05-02T20:39:00.000Z	s0ja		JowI: I'm not that keen on Compiz, if I could just playback my .avi files using VLC I'd be content...
2010-05-02T20:41:00.000Z	Jowi	s0ja	weird. you can generate an xorg.conf by running "Xorg -configure" that you can then modify to your needs
2010-05-02T20:42:00.000Z	s0ja		Jovi: Nope, tried that a few times. Nothing happens when I run dpgk-reconfigure and so on, when I try to edit xorg.conf afterwards all i get is an empty file

2010-05-02T20:42:00.000Z	s0ja		sure thing
2010-05-02T20:43:00.000Z	Jowi	s0ja	you need to run the command when Xorg is not running (e.g. stop gdm, run the command to generate the file)
2010-05-02T20:44:00.000Z	s0ja	Jowi	http://pastebin.org/198079 - PM me, might be less confusing ;)
2010-05-02T20:46:00.000Z	s0ja	Jowi	right, will keep it in the channel :)
2010-05-02T20:51:00.000Z	Jowi	s0ja	sorry, I'm not sure
2010-05-02T20:51:00.000Z	s0ja	Jowi	did they change the way they implement drivers in lucid? if not, could I just use another driveR?
2010-05-02T20:51:00.000Z	s0ja	Jowi	Like this one http://www.petergodwin.org/blog/?p=147 !?
2010-05-02T20:54:00.000Z	Jowi	s0ja	yes, the xserver is a newer one (1.7.6). I've only used Lucid for a couple of days so I'm not too familiar with the versions of the intel drivers and why gma950 doesn't work correctly
2010-05-02T20:55:00.000Z	Jowi	s0ja	I have the 945gm myself.
2010-05-02T20:55:00.000Z	s0ja	Jowi	What machine do you have? I have a white macbook (late 2006) - could that be the problem?
2010-05-02T20:56:00.000Z	Jowi	s0ja	mac mini intel (core duo)
2010-05-02T20:56:00.000Z	Jowi	s0ja	mine should also be from around 2006-2007
