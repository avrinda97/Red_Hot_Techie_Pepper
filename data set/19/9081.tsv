2007-02-11T09:26:00.000Z	arrenlex		Can anyone recommend a good, light, functional desktop I could install?
2007-02-11T09:26:00.000Z	nemo_home	arrenlex	XFCE4!
2007-02-11T09:26:00.000Z	nemo_home	arrenlex	I use that on my old P133 with 96MiB of ram
2007-02-11T09:26:00.000Z	arrenlex	nemo_home	What are the benefits of XFCE with respect to things like enlightenment?
2007-02-11T09:26:00.000Z	nemo_home	arrenlex	What I like is it uses GTK2 for rendering
2007-02-11T09:27:00.000Z	nemo_home	arrenlex	on my old machine I simply only installed GTK2 apps
2007-02-11T09:27:00.000Z	nemo_home	arrenlex	that cut down on the libs I needed to load in my tiny amount of ram
2007-02-11T09:27:00.000Z	nemo_home	arrenlex	for example, I used audacious as my music player
2007-02-11T09:28:00.000Z	nemo_home	arrenlex	worked pretty well, with X running, and relatively little swap used, I used only about 35MiB with XFCE4 running
2007-02-11T09:28:00.000Z	nemo_home	arrenlex	switch his driver in xorg.conf
2007-02-11T09:28:00.000Z	nemo_home	arrenlex	he just needs to change the driver line
2007-02-11T09:28:00.000Z	nemo_home	arrenlex	anyway, it worked well for me
2007-02-11T09:29:00.000Z	arrenlex	nemo_home	I'll try xfce, then. Thanks.
2007-02-11T09:29:00.000Z	nemo_home	arrenlex	I think there's even an XFCE4 ubuntu. I don't know if they stuck to a single gui toolkit
2007-02-11T09:29:00.000Z	nemo_home	arrenlex	personally, I went gentoo, with -Os set - my theory was I cared more about the size of libraries in memory than saving on cycles :)
2007-02-11T09:30:00.000Z	arrenlex	nemo_home	Life is too short to run gentoo.
2007-02-11T09:30:00.000Z	nemo_home	arrenlex	heh. have 5 gentoo machines personally :) but hey, to each his own
2007-02-11T09:31:00.000Z	nemo_home	arrenlex	I must say I'm spending far too much time poking at obscure issues with my mom's ubuntu system too. like this latest ubuntu breaking wireless with recent kernel rename.
2007-02-11T09:31:00.000Z	nemo_home	arrenlex	seems all distros are prone to stupid updates
