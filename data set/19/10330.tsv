2007-01-24T08:45:00.000Z	wolfwalker		|Spasticteapot:| join the club. I can't even get my Linux computer connected to the net
2007-01-24T08:45:00.000Z	cablesm102	wolfwalker	are you using wireless?
2007-01-24T08:46:00.000Z	cablesm102	wolfwalker	have you tried configuring with PPPoE?
2007-01-24T08:47:00.000Z	cablesm102	wolfwalker	you might be able to get a different modem from your ISP. Some have more than one model available
2007-01-24T08:49:00.000Z	cablesm102	wolfwalker	just get a router and connect it to the modem. Most routers can connect to a linux box, and most routers can connect to a DSL modem
2007-01-24T08:50:00.000Z	cablesm102	wolfwalker	most should. I use a WRT54G.
2007-01-24T08:51:00.000Z	cablesm102	wolfwalker	most routers are configured through an HTTP interface
2007-01-24T08:55:00.000Z	cablesm102	wolfwalker	plug it in to someone else's ethernet. Preferably someone who you don't know. Break in.
2007-01-24T08:57:00.000Z	cablesm102	wolfwalker	if you've got an aquaintance with broadband, try taking your computer over.
2007-01-24T08:58:00.000Z	cablesm102	wolfwalker	i just said broadband because of etherent
