2010-07-27T10:11:00.000Z	uLinux		hello
2010-07-27T10:12:00.000Z	uLinux		I connected 2 Ubuntu (Lucid) machines on lan and Im trying to share a folder
2010-07-27T10:12:00.000Z	uLinux		but it's not working
2010-07-27T10:12:00.000Z	uLinux		i use same user and hostname on both machines
2010-07-27T10:13:00.000Z	uLinux		I can ping both machines
2010-07-27T10:14:00.000Z	natex	uLinux	have you looked at https://help.ubuntu.com/10.04/internet/C/networking-shares.html
2010-07-27T10:15:00.000Z	natex	uLinux	you could also look into NFS
2010-07-27T10:17:00.000Z	natex	uLinux	have you looked at https://help.ubuntu.com/10.04/internet/C/networking-shares.html?
2010-07-27T10:33:00.000Z	uLinux	natex	i restarted both machines and then connect using "Connect to Server" at Places.. and now I can see the folder im sharing but cant open it/mount it
2010-07-27T10:34:00.000Z	natex	uLinux	you have a permissions problem
2010-07-27T10:35:00.000Z	uLinux	natex	allow others to access it and guests.. these options are enabled
2010-07-27T10:36:00.000Z	uLinux	natex	"Others: Create and delete files"
2010-07-27T10:36:00.000Z	natex	uLinux	are we talking about two linux boxes?
2010-07-27T10:37:00.000Z	natex	uLinux	first I would read https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SettingUpSamba
2010-07-27T10:42:00.000Z	natex	uLinux	have you read the doc I mentioned?
2010-07-27T10:42:00.000Z	uLinux	natex	 im reading it but it's too complex
2010-07-27T10:42:00.000Z	natex	uLinux	...
2010-07-27T10:43:00.000Z	natex	uLinux	focus :)
2010-07-27T10:44:00.000Z	natex	uLinux	using the terminal is nearly foolproof. no GUI junk to fsck things up.
