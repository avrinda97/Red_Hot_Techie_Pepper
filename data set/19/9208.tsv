2006-12-26T10:49:00.000Z	Slart		hmm, inserting a DVD disc seems to have killed my gnome-panel.. grrrr.. brb
2006-12-26T10:50:00.000Z	adaptr	Slart	that's nothing.. adding konsole to my panel completely destroyed mine :)
2007-01-07T17:44:00.000Z	Slart	adaptr	I've never seen one that does that.. but let me know if you find one.. I want it too
2007-01-07T17:44:00.000Z	adaptr	Slart	if I could program I'd build one, because this has irritated me from the first ime I've used IRC.. it is sooo obvious
2007-01-07T17:45:00.000Z	Slart	adaptr	indeed.. I'm using gnome xchat at the moment.. it's ok.. but it could be better
2007-01-07T17:46:00.000Z	Slart	adaptr	hmm.. I still think irc is pretty much all text =)
2007-01-07T17:46:00.000Z	adaptr	Slart	mnoir: you know of an IRC client that's at least decently scriptable, like mIRC is ?
2007-01-07T17:46:00.000Z	Slart	adaptr	I think xchat is among the better..
2007-01-07T17:47:00.000Z	adaptr	Slart	true, in its essence, yes  - but one of the advantages of a GUI is that it lets me manipulate text outside of the restrictions associated with a text-only screen... a very, very simple and obvious concept that a lot of OSS programmers still fail to grasp
2007-01-07T17:50:00.000Z	adaptr	Slart	I used to think so too. .until I started ripping all the superfluous KDE stuff out again, because I could not get shit to work anymore.. think artsd (iiiew!) the dcop framework, kdm, and a lot of smaller things that can generously break your system, or at least make it less stable
2007-01-07T17:51:00.000Z	Slart	adaptr	oh? I haven't had any problems yet.. perhaps I'm just lucky.. I think i have artsd installed.. but it just sits there.. =)
2007-01-07T17:52:00.000Z	adaptr	Slart	do you use JACK, or anything else that would like to share your audio ? small tip : KDE ...won't
2007-01-07T17:53:00.000Z	Slart	adaptr	I've been fighting with getting sound to work so I think I have pretty much everything installed.. jackd, esd, arts.. probably something else too.. yes.. Alsa of course.. and OSS.. and OSS through ALSA..
2007-01-17T15:38:00.000Z	Slart	adaptr	you're not starting that old discussion again, are you ? =)
2007-05-25T05:19:00.000Z	Slart	adaptr	oh.. you will... you will =)
2009-02-24T04:27:00.000Z	adaptr	Slart	there are definite advantages to sharing a local disk with a VM that has no network connectivity itself
2009-02-24T04:27:00.000Z	adaptr	Slart	for example, you could set up a Windows install that's actually secure :)
2009-02-24T04:28:00.000Z	Slart	adaptr	hehe.. indeed... but can't you keep the virtual network separated from the real network? and just add the host computer on the virtual network?
2009-02-24T04:28:00.000Z	adaptr	Slart	that is what I am talking about, yes
