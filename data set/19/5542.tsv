2010-05-24T21:18:00.000Z	bastidrazor	mohamad	please don't PM, keep it in the channel.
2010-05-24T21:19:00.000Z	mohamad	bastidrazor	no1 is answering me in the channel
2010-05-24T21:19:00.000Z	bastidrazor	mohamad	i will nto answer you in PM, either.
2010-05-24T21:21:00.000Z	bastidrazor	mohamad	once you run sudo nvidia-config you should  log out then back in. then run gksudo nvidia-settings .. none of this will work if you have not installed a nVidia driver
2010-05-24T21:21:00.000Z	mohamad	bastidrazor	thx i'll try it now
2010-05-24T21:24:00.000Z	mohamad	bastidrazor	when i type sudo nvidia-config it says command not found
2010-05-24T21:25:00.000Z	bastidrazor	mohamad	then it is not installed. sudo apt-get install nvidia-config
2010-05-24T21:27:00.000Z	mohamad	bastidrazor	now it says " E: Couldn't find package nvidia-config " ,, the nvidia driver was downloaded 30 min ago
2010-05-24T21:32:00.000Z	bastidrazor	mohamad	how did you get the nvidia driver?
2010-05-24T21:33:00.000Z	mohamad	bastidrazor	some1 showed me how to get it and it downloaded like +60MB then spent 10 min unpacking and setting up
2010-05-24T21:34:00.000Z	bastidrazor	mohamad	okay, that still does not tell me how you acquired the driver. did you sudo apt-get something or use synaptic or download it from nVidia?
2010-05-24T21:34:00.000Z	mohamad	bastidrazor	the sudo apt-get
