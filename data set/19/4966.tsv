2008-09-27T10:32:00.000Z	pooki		i just installed 8.04 64. but i dont seem to be able to boot from hdd
2008-09-27T10:32:00.000Z	pooki		installed on a sata drive. the livecd saw it fine. p45 chipset so i changed bios sata drives to ahci
2008-09-27T10:32:00.000Z	pooki		but after install when i reboot it says reboot and select proper boot device
2008-09-27T10:33:00.000Z	pooki		erm DasEi1 i dont think it starts, it cant find the hdd to boot from. i post, get past bios, then it cant find anything
2008-09-27T10:34:00.000Z	pooki		bios can see my hdds, the livecd can see them too. but when i try to boot no go
2008-09-27T10:34:00.000Z	pooki		before install DasEi1
2008-09-27T10:34:00.000Z	pooki		the livecd wouldnt load into gnome without ahci

2008-09-27T10:38:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	pooki	have you installed ubuntu? and are you able to boot into it?
2008-09-27T10:38:00.000Z	pooki	arvind_khadri	installed, will not boot
2008-09-27T10:38:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	pooki	does grub show up?
2008-09-27T10:39:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	pooki	the drive in which you installed ubuntu should boot first... assuming you have two drives
2008-09-27T10:39:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	pooki	do you get error about grub?
2008-09-27T10:40:00.000Z	pooki	arvind_khadri	no doesnt get that far. doesnt find the hdd
2008-09-27T10:40:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	pooki	make sure no external drives are attached...check for CD in the tray
2008-09-27T10:40:00.000Z	pooki	arvind_khadri	ill try changing which hdd is booting in the bios again. but im pretty sure i got the right one
