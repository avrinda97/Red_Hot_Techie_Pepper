2005-10-25T15:18:00.000Z	ptashek		hi ubuntuers
2005-10-25T15:19:00.000Z	ptashek		is there a list of differences between ubuntu-dvd and ubuntu-cd versions?
2005-10-25T15:19:00.000Z	Seveas	ptashek	ubuntu-dvd has all of the main repository on dvd
2005-10-25T15:28:00.000Z	ptashek	Seveas	would you know how much is Ubuntu different from Debian in terms of directory layout etc.?
2005-10-25T15:28:00.000Z	Seveas	ptashek	not at all in that aspect
2005-10-25T15:28:00.000Z	Seveas	ptashek	Ubuntu and debian have different goals, a different release schedule and different, but overlapping communities. See also http://www.ubuntulinux.org/ubuntu/relationship
2005-10-25T15:43:00.000Z	Seveas	ptashek	it's nice enough
2005-10-25T15:44:00.000Z	Seveas	ptashek	in fact: it can even resize the ntfs thing to make room for itself :)
2005-10-25T15:54:00.000Z	ptashek	Seveas	how come a dutchman knows how to swear in hiberno-english? (bollocks)
2005-10-25T15:55:00.000Z	Seveas	ptashek	I've talked to jdub :)
2005-10-26T16:09:00.000Z	Seveas	ptashek	nooooooooooooo
2005-10-26T16:10:00.000Z	ptashek	Seveas	why? It's more error-proof as it checks dependencies more strictly
2005-10-26T16:10:00.000Z	Seveas	ptashek	nonsense :)
2005-10-26T16:10:00.000Z	ptashek	Seveas	sense :-
2005-10-26T16:11:00.000Z	ptashek	Seveas	yes, but aptitude will fail in cases where apt-get will hapilly turn your OS into an broken packages nightmare
2005-10-26T16:11:00.000Z	Seveas	ptashek	ENEVERHAPPENEDHERE
2005-10-26T16:11:00.000Z	ptashek	Seveas	ever used Sid? ;-)
2005-10-26T16:12:00.000Z	Seveas	ptashek	don't blame apt errors on sid
2005-10-26T16:12:00.000Z	ptashek	Seveas	yes, yes, it's unstable :-)
