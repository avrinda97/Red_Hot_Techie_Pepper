2006-10-11T13:35:00.000Z	compilerwriter		Hello all I am a newbie that needs someone to take pity on me and help me mount a floppy drive.  I keep screwing something up.
2006-10-11T13:35:00.000Z	Goomie	compilerwriter	i think it auto mounts it in /media/floppy
2006-10-11T13:39:00.000Z	Goomie	compilerwriter	sudo mount /dev/fd /mnt/floppy , assuming its on that
2006-10-11T13:40:00.000Z	compilerwriter	Goomie	I just installed 6.01 a few weeks ago.
2006-10-11T13:45:00.000Z	Goomie	compilerwriter	when you try and mount the floppy do u get an erro?
2006-10-11T13:46:00.000Z	Goomie	compilerwriter	mount /dev/fd0 /media/floppy
2006-10-11T13:47:00.000Z	Goomie	compilerwriter	/media/floppy, if that directory doesnt exist you will have to make it
2006-10-11T13:48:00.000Z	Goomie	compilerwriter	you can name it whatever you want thats just the mount directory the /dev/fd0 depends on how many like paddy asked
2006-10-11T13:50:00.000Z	Goomie	compilerwriter	if floppy0 is already present in /media then go ahead and run mount /dev/fd0 /media/floppy0
2006-10-11T13:53:00.000Z	Goomie	compilerwriter	mount -t vfat /dev/fd0 /media/floppy0 if that dont work try msdos
2006-10-11T13:53:00.000Z	Goomie	compilerwriter	that would be a good idea
2006-10-11T13:55:00.000Z	Goomie	compilerwriter	maybe, not a big gui fan, if not just open up filebrowser and go to /media/floppy0
2006-10-11T13:57:00.000Z	Goomie	compilerwriter	dont be lazy :)
2006-10-11T13:57:00.000Z	Goomie	compilerwriter	you can try googling automount floppy
2006-10-11T13:58:00.000Z	Goomie	compilerwriter	there you go IcemanV9, you can write scripts to make your life easier
2006-10-11T13:59:00.000Z	Goomie	compilerwriter	i think you have to due to the nature of it
2006-10-11T13:59:00.000Z	Goomie	compilerwriter	you shouldnt need the sudo actually
2006-10-11T14:03:00.000Z	Goomie	compilerwriter	i think the entry is in your fstab all you have to do is mount /dev/fd0 and it should mount it there
2006-10-11T14:14:00.000Z	Goomie	compilerwriter	u can hit the button any time , but if you have stuff that you wanted to write to it , then it might not get wrote unless u umount first
