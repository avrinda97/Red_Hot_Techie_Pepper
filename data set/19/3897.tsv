2009-05-08T04:23:00.000Z	mgwalk		i changed the name in that file and in /etc/network/interfaces to eth0 and it started
2009-05-08T04:24:00.000Z	mgwalk		sorry and restarted networking and still showing eth1
2009-05-08T04:24:00.000Z	thewrath	mgwalk	did you do eth0 ifup or something like that
2009-05-08T04:25:00.000Z	mgwalk	thewrath	i tried ifup eth0 and ifup eth1
2009-05-08T04:25:00.000Z	mgwalk	thewrath	and it said they are not configured..so i tried ifdown on same interfaces
2009-05-08T04:25:00.000Z	thewrath	mgwalk	what did that do then
2009-05-08T04:27:00.000Z	mgwalk	thewrath	its sill up and working but labeled eth1
2009-05-08T04:27:00.000Z	thewrath	mgwalk	eth1 instead of eth0?
2009-05-08T04:27:00.000Z	mgwalk	thewrath	maybe i need to reboot after editing that file...i just changed the 0 to a 1 and removed the eth0 that was in there because it came from an image of a previous machine..
2009-05-08T04:28:00.000Z	thewrath	mgwalk	that would work
