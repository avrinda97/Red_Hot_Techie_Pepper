2007-10-23T03:54:00.000Z	jburd		I mean it shows you the GDM login screen does it not?
2007-10-23T03:55:00.000Z	jburd		oh hehe
2007-10-23T03:55:00.000Z	jburd		well try the 64-bit version
2007-10-23T03:57:00.000Z	jburd		hehe
2007-10-23T03:58:00.000Z	jburd		well so far gutsy has been good except for the desktop effects part.
2007-10-23T03:59:00.000Z	levmatta	jburd	Why didn't you like the desktop effects
2007-10-23T03:59:00.000Z	jburd	levmatta	Uhm, well it stops X from responding.
2007-10-23T04:00:00.000Z	levmatta	jburd	did you install the compiz fusion manager?
2007-10-23T04:01:00.000Z	jburd	levmatta	The bug is in compiz, not gutsy.  Every time I minimize and restore any window, compiz's memory consumption goes up 1% and after a while X crashes.
2007-10-23T04:02:00.000Z	levmatta	jburd	I was just thinking of installing compizconfig-settings-manager and disabling some effects
2007-10-23T04:02:00.000Z	levmatta	jburd	compizconfig-settings-manager lets you configure it and test it better
2007-10-23T04:03:00.000Z	jburd	levmatta	Try this on your box if you can:  open a term and type top.  (watch compiz.real)    turn on desktop effects and minimize and maximize a window repeatedly.  watch the mem consumption.
2007-10-23T04:03:00.000Z	levmatta	jburd	OK
2007-10-23T04:04:00.000Z	jburd	levmatta	What happens at your end?
2007-10-23T04:07:00.000Z	levmatta	jburd	it did not move, %MEM, SHR, VIRT did not change
2007-10-23T04:07:00.000Z	levmatta	jburd	I am using the nvidia driver
2007-10-23T04:08:00.000Z	jburd	levmatta	Well I'm using the nvidia driver too, and I also tried the git repo version of compiz.
2007-10-23T04:09:00.000Z	jburd	levmatta	Still the same thing.
2007-10-23T04:10:00.000Z	levmatta	jburd	sorry to bug you, I will try to google it and search the compiz-fusion forum
