2005-11-18T11:29:00.000Z	MrFarts		 where exactly can i get the ms core fonts package for ubuntu ?
2005-11-18T11:30:00.000Z	Amaranth	MrFarts	install that
2005-11-18T11:31:00.000Z	Amaranth	MrFarts	yeah, you need to enable the multiverse repository, look at what ubotu just PMed you
2005-11-18T11:32:00.000Z	MrFarts	Amaranth	i wish the errors were a bit less preposterous
2005-11-18T11:32:00.000Z	Amaranth	MrFarts	Well, it can't read minds...
2005-11-18T11:32:00.000Z	Amaranth	MrFarts	I don't see how that error message can say anything different and still actually make sense.
2005-11-18T11:33:00.000Z	MrFarts	Amaranth	i did enable the multiverse repository
2005-11-18T11:33:00.000Z	Amaranth	MrFarts	and ran sudo apt-get update? (or clicked reload in synaptic)
2005-11-18T11:36:00.000Z	Amaranth	MrFarts	Language.
2005-11-18T11:36:00.000Z	MrFarts	Amaranth	what about it ?
2005-11-18T11:37:00.000Z	Amaranth	MrFarts	Please don't swear.
2005-11-18T11:38:00.000Z	Amaranth	MrFarts	That's breezy-security, you need to edit the line that says for just breezy
2005-11-18T11:51:00.000Z	Amaranth	MrFarts	You have the base installed though.
2005-11-18T11:51:00.000Z	Amaranth	MrFarts	Install the build-essential package.
2005-11-18T11:53:00.000Z	MrFarts	Amaranth	of course it doesn't actually work ...
2005-11-18T11:54:00.000Z	Amaranth	MrFarts	Exactly what it sounds like, the essential stuff for building things.
2005-11-18T11:54:00.000Z	MrFarts	Amaranth	why would i want the compiler by itself ?
2005-11-18T11:55:00.000Z	Amaranth	MrFarts	err, build-essential installs more than the compiler
2005-11-18T11:56:00.000Z	Amaranth	MrFarts	If you want the low-level details build-essential contains all of the packages you can assume are already installed on a buildd (server to build packages for the distro)
