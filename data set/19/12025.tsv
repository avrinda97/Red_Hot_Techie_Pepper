2005-12-12T14:02:00.000Z	St^Anger^19m		most would disagree with me and say "that what's nice, you have a choice", but the thing i dislike most is the different interfaces and menu system in different distros.....finally i decided to stick to ubuntu, come hell or high water
2005-12-12T14:04:00.000Z	St^Anger^19m		i want Linux to take over M$ :)

2005-12-12T14:07:00.000Z	St^Anger^19m		in 5 months i learnt a lot...i can configure my ubuntu installation in a few hours
