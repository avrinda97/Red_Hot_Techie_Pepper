2007-11-01T21:15:00.000Z	limen		I have problems with my wlan-card (a SMC2802W V.1). I can see the card in gutsy but it can't find any accespoints. If I do a "lshw" the status of the card is "NOT READY!". A strange symphtom is that the status-LEDs on the card doesn't flash, not even when I boot. Tried the card in another comp. also running gutsy, and there the LEDs flashed during the boot-sequence... Any ideas?
2007-11-01T21:16:00.000Z	webwolf_27	limen	is the firmware installed
2007-11-01T21:17:00.000Z	limen	webwolf_27	how do I see if its not?
2007-11-01T21:18:00.000Z	webwolf_27	limen	for that specific card, I don't know. Find out the name of the firmware in question then rund a locate on it
2007-11-01T21:30:00.000Z	webwolf_27	limen	probably, you obviosly can use a hardware that the kernal can't talk to
2007-11-01T21:26:00.000Z	webwolf_27	limen	can you read gernam?
2007-11-01T21:27:00.000Z	webwolf_27	limen	make sure the prism modules are installed and loaded
2007-11-01T21:29:00.000Z	limen	webwolf_27	No sorry, my deutch-skills are rather crappy. The prism-modules are loaded. But would that really affect the LEDs flashing during bootup?
2007-11-01T21:31:00.000Z	webwolf_27	limen	can == can'T
2007-11-01T21:32:00.000Z	limen	webwolf_27	but its strange that the card works on my other computer when they have the same configuration
2007-11-01T21:32:00.000Z	webwolf_27	limen	same distro and version? exact same card?
2007-11-01T21:33:00.000Z	limen	webwolf_27	yes installed from the same disc :) And yes the same card
2007-11-01T21:34:00.000Z	webwolf_27	limen	because there are two versions. v1 works. v2 is a paperweight
2007-11-01T21:36:00.000Z	limen	webwolf_27	yes I've read that. And its the V.1 I got. But I checked the hardware information now and it seems like the computer for some reason recognizes the card as V.2.. Maybe I screwed it all up trying to get it working... Maybe a reinstall would help..
2007-11-01T21:37:00.000Z	webwolf_27	limen	that would explain it. maybe it also has a slieghtly differant chip
2007-11-01T21:37:00.000Z	limen	webwolf_27	than the V.1 ?
2007-11-01T21:38:00.000Z	webwolf_27	limen	according to what I'v found here (in german) yes
2007-11-01T21:39:00.000Z	limen	webwolf_27	OK, I just reinstall and hope that'll do it.. Thanks for all the help!
2007-11-01T21:39:00.000Z	webwolf_27	limen	No problem. I've still got a netgear here I've been trying to get working
