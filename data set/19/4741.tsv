2011-09-27T23:37:00.000Z	b3ta		and it fixed MY issue.
2011-09-27T23:38:00.000Z	b3ta		i haven't personally tested it on 11.10.  i utilized that on 10.04
2011-09-27T23:39:00.000Z	b3ta		is 11.10 out of alpha/beta yet?
2011-09-27T23:40:00.000Z	b3ta		ahhh
2011-09-27T23:40:00.000Z	b3ta		have you tried to replicate on a previous version?
2011-09-27T23:41:00.000Z	b3ta		but that's previous to html5
2011-09-27T23:43:00.000Z	b3ta		there are always quirks
2011-09-27T23:44:00.000Z	b3ta		dual core!
2011-09-27T23:44:00.000Z	b3ta		you're set
2011-09-27T23:46:00.000Z	b3ta		enjoy your ubuntu server :)
2011-09-27T23:47:00.000Z	jpds	b3ta	â†‘
2011-09-27T23:48:00.000Z	jpds	b3ta	wut.
2011-09-27T23:48:00.000Z	jpds	b3ta	You do realize you get no security upgrades of you don't apt-get upgrade?
2011-09-27T23:49:00.000Z	b3ta	jpds	do you realize that if your network is setup properly you don't need to upgrade anything?
2011-09-27T23:49:00.000Z	jpds	b3ta	No, that's not true.
2011-09-27T23:52:00.000Z	jpds	b3ta	And what about security updates like http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-1215-1/ ?
2011-09-27T23:53:00.000Z	jpds	b3ta	Which doesn't apply to a an external facing service but is still a security risk?
2011-09-27T23:53:00.000Z	b3ta	jpds	 so you're saying just b/c there's an exploit it should be updated.  wrong.
2011-09-27T23:54:00.000Z	b3ta	jpds	 if noone can get into my system to RUN apt-get, then why would I care?
