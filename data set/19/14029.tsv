2004-11-17T07:25:00.000Z	Zimpee		which is the generic driver for all graphics cards? at install it asks, but there isn't my video card
2004-11-17T07:25:00.000Z	Zimpee		Nvidia GeForce 4 ti 4200 64MB TV-OUT
2004-11-17T07:26:00.000Z	Zimpee		nv driver doesnt work
2004-11-17T07:26:00.000Z	kent	Zimpee	have you tried using the nonfree driver?
2004-11-17T07:26:00.000Z	kent		I have a Nvidia TNT2. It works just perfectly.
2004-11-17T07:26:00.000Z	Zimpee	kent	i'd, but i couldn't find the kernel source
2004-11-17T07:27:00.000Z	Zimpee		and it needs it
2004-11-17T07:27:00.000Z	Zimpee		but if i want to configure a new kernel, it messes with ncurses, says it is not installed. but it is
2004-11-17T07:27:00.000Z	kent	Zimpee	add restricted to apt (or synaptic) and install nvidia-glx. Thats all that is needed.
2004-11-17T07:28:00.000Z	Zimpee		yes i know, but it didn't find ncurses-dev
2004-11-17T07:28:00.000Z	Zimpee		and i didn't find it too
2004-11-17T07:29:00.000Z	Zimpee	kent	: sorry, i don't understand what to do:) my english...:)
2004-11-17T07:30:00.000Z	kent	Zimpee	use synaptic. Edit the repositories (its in the menu) and add restricted where it sais main.. etc. Then refresh, and install nvidia-glx
2004-11-17T07:30:00.000Z	kent	Zimpee	i have to shower now. Perhaps some other can help you on this.
2004-11-17T07:30:00.000Z	Zimpee		oh, i got it
2004-11-17T07:30:00.000Z	Zimpee		i got it, thanks kent
2004-11-17T07:30:00.000Z	Zimpee		[away] 
2004-11-17T07:31:00.000Z	kent	Zimpee	though i think you have to manually edit /etc/X11/XF86config-4 and  change Driver "nv" to Driver "nvidia" or something..
