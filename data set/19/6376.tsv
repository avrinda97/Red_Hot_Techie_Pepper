2008-06-13T13:02:00.000Z	bazhang	Ububegin	why not bzr subversion or git
2008-06-13T13:07:00.000Z	Ububegin	bazhang	Just a generic cvs question.. Once i have imported the module... why do i have to checkout a working copy... why doesnt the imported module already become a cvs folder.. Does the other clients automatically make the imported folder the cvs folder or is there additional check out needed.
