2007-10-20T17:46:00.000Z	NotSure		Can someone tell me how to solve the following problem. Sometimes applications want to alert user by flashing their titlebar. Unfortunately, the titlebars may show up in the workspace that they were not opened in. It is very uncomfortable for me. Can somebody offer a solution to this problem? I use Gnome. Thank You.
2007-10-20T17:47:00.000Z	Saied	NotSure	it is not a problem! kind of notification :D
2007-10-20T17:48:00.000Z	NotSure	Saied	thank you for replying. I find this feature to be extremely annoying as it clutters my workspace and I lose the sense of organization. Could you help me?
2007-10-20T17:50:00.000Z	Saied	NotSure	i'm using KDE but this is configurable maybe by using gconf-editor. did you search ubuntuforums?
2007-10-20T17:52:00.000Z	NotSure	Saied	I have invested a considerable bulk of my time into this issue. I have been googling for a while but to no avail. gconf-editor apparantly does not contain the necessary options. I am certain however that my request may be fulfilled as everything is open source. Again, I beg for the help of open source community.

2007-10-20T17:56:00.000Z	NotSure	Saied	this feature was apparently designed for help. However, whenever there are certain programs that tend to misbehave. For instance, Krusader will flash the titlebar without apparent justification. Konsole does that as well.
2007-10-20T17:56:00.000Z	NotSure	Saied	I realize I misspoke
2007-10-20T17:57:00.000Z	Saied	NotSure	it exists on all applications?
2007-10-20T17:58:00.000Z	Saied	NotSure	or on gnome-terminal only?
2007-10-20T17:58:00.000Z	NotSure	Saied	no, this is not peculiar to every program. I don't use gnome-terminal, I use Konsole.
2007-10-20T18:02:00.000Z	Saied	NotSure	Konsole in Gnome? great!
2007-10-20T18:03:00.000Z	NotSure	Saied	is there anything wrong in using Konsole in Gnome?
2007-10-20T18:04:00.000Z	Saied	NotSure	absolutely no! you are using compiz?
2007-10-20T18:06:00.000Z	NotSure	Saied	I am not familiar with compiz
2007-10-20T18:08:00.000Z	Saied	NotSure	maybe it is a bug! send it to ubuntu-bugs@lists.ubuntu.com , there are people that can solve it and create updates
2007-10-20T18:08:00.000Z	NotSure	Saied	thank you for the reference, I will certainly write an email
2007-10-20T18:09:00.000Z	NotSure	Saied	compize seems to be something like beryl
2007-10-20T18:26:00.000Z	NotSure	Saied	I am sorry to bother you, could you please supply me with the email to ubuntu community support? I cannot scroll up, so many messages have been posted since your last message.
