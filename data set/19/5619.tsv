2008-06-18T14:10:00.000Z	wgrant	the_eraser	sudo swapon -a
2008-06-18T14:10:00.000Z	the_eraser	wgrant	its empty :/
2008-06-18T14:09:00.000Z	wgrant	the_eraser	'working'?
2008-06-18T14:09:00.000Z	the_eraser	wgrant	yea i might have erased it or something :)
2008-06-18T14:09:00.000Z	wgrant	the_eraser	cat /proc/swaps
2008-06-18T14:10:00.000Z	the_eraser	wgrant	i get errors.. i've messed up this hehe :/
2008-06-18T14:11:00.000Z	the_eraser	wgrant	oh it has to be the uuid
2008-06-18T14:11:00.000Z	wgrant	the_eraser	You can always run mkswap on it, but make sure you have no useful data on it.
2008-06-18T14:11:00.000Z	the_eraser	wgrant	it has changed
2008-06-18T14:11:00.000Z	wgrant	the_eraser	Not necessarily.
2008-06-18T14:12:00.000Z	the_eraser	wgrant	does mkswap update the uuid for me?
2008-06-18T14:12:00.000Z	wgrant	the_eraser	It will generate a new UUID.
2008-06-18T14:12:00.000Z	the_eraser	wgrant	ok thx
2008-06-18T14:14:00.000Z	the_eraser	wgrant	if i want to set uuid manually in fstab, how can i see what number the filesystem is actually using?
2008-06-18T14:14:00.000Z	wgrant	the_eraser	Use vol_id.
2008-06-18T14:14:00.000Z	the_eraser	wgrant	ok
2008-06-18T14:22:00.000Z	the_eraser	wgrant	swap's is on now thx :-)
