2012-01-13T18:53:00.000Z	gametstr		I need to get 2.6.37 on 11.04 anyone?
2012-01-13T18:53:00.000Z	auronandace	gametstr	why?
2012-01-13T18:54:00.000Z	gametstr	auronandace	: Power consumption problems and overheating
2012-01-13T18:54:00.000Z	auronandace	gametstr	can't use 11.10? that has the 3 kernel
2012-01-13T18:56:00.000Z	auronandace	gametstr	ah i see
2012-01-13T18:58:00.000Z	gametstr	auronandace	read those but synaptic wont return me any results
2012-01-13T18:59:00.000Z	auronandace	gametstr	2.6.37 isn't in the repos, you'd need to compile it
2012-01-13T19:00:00.000Z	gametstr	auronandace	ahh.. I dont know if I am up to compiling it
2012-01-13T19:01:00.000Z	auronandace	gametstr	in that case you may need to go further back (10.04 is still supported)
2012-01-13T19:07:00.000Z	gametstr	auronandace	: is compiling a kernel difficult much for a noob?
2012-01-13T19:07:00.000Z	auronandace	gametstr	i couldn't tell you sorry, i've never done it
2012-01-13T19:09:00.000Z	auronandace	gametstr	you could check to see if someone made a ppa of 2.6.37
2012-01-13T19:22:00.000Z	gametstr	auronandace	: searched there with no luck.. is there an easier way to find it?
2012-01-13T19:23:00.000Z	auronandace	gametstr	about ppas? i don't use them, i'm just aware they exist
2012-01-13T19:39:00.000Z	gametstr	auronandace	: so u can easily remove ubuntu if need be?
2012-01-13T19:40:00.000Z	auronandace	gametstr	as opposed to deleting a partition? i don't get what is so complicated about that?
2012-01-13T19:40:00.000Z	gametstr	auronandace	: with dual boot it messes ur mbr
2012-01-13T19:41:00.000Z	auronandace	gametstr	assuming you let it
2012-01-13T19:43:00.000Z	gametstr	auronandace	: well thats how beginners 'd do it
