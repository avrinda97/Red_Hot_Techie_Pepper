2006-08-28T16:03:00.000Z	Tomtheman70		I had an issue while installing xubuntu, the select and install software portion of the install failed.
2006-08-28T16:03:00.000Z	Tomtheman70		I'm using the alternate PC install
2006-08-28T16:03:00.000Z	Tomtheman70		text based.
2006-08-28T08:52:00.000Z	Tomtheman70		Ok, complete noob question, I just installed xubuntu, and I'm a BRAND new user to linux. I'm trying to run a file I've downloaded from ATi, the drivers. (ati-driver-installer08.28.8.run) How do I run it?
2006-08-28T08:53:00.000Z	oskude	Tomtheman70	read that, its an easier way to install ati binary drivers
2006-08-28T08:53:00.000Z	Tomtheman70	oskude	thanks, I'll refer to that.
2006-08-28T08:53:00.000Z	Tomtheman70	oskude	I don't have internet on the laptop.
2006-08-28T08:54:00.000Z	oskude	Tomtheman70	hmm... you could download it from repo and install it "offline"... you need atleast fglrx and some kernel modules...
2006-08-28T08:55:00.000Z	Tomtheman70	oskude	this is going to take some getting used to .__.
2006-08-28T08:56:00.000Z	oskude	Tomtheman70	if you had interent, it would just be "sudo apt-get instal server-xorg-driver-ati"
2006-08-28T08:56:00.000Z	oskude	Tomtheman70	no wait, ment this "xorg-driver-fglrx"
2006-08-28T08:56:00.000Z	Tomtheman70	oskude	so just type that in the terminal and it'll get it and install it for me?
2006-08-28T08:57:00.000Z	Tomtheman70	oskude	when I have internet of course.
2006-08-28T08:57:00.000Z	oskude	Tomtheman70	yes, if you have internet access. but you may need to change the driver in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2006-08-28T08:59:00.000Z	oskude	Tomtheman70	so you install that driver with "sudo apt-get install xorg-driver-fglrx" and edit with this "sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf" and change "Driver          "ati"" to "Driver "fglrx" then restart gnome
2006-08-28T08:59:00.000Z	Tomtheman70	oskude	thank you very much
2006-08-28T09:04:00.000Z	oskude	Tomtheman70	maybe this could help https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/LinksysWPC54G
