2007-09-17T13:10:00.000Z	vsayikiran		i want to know where the programs get installed when i install them using apt-get install package-name
2007-09-17T13:11:00.000Z	vsayikiran		what is the equivlent of progrma files in ubuntu
2007-09-17T13:11:00.000Z	vsayikiran		in which folder does the package gets installed
2007-09-17T13:11:00.000Z	LjL	vsayikiran	there is none. while on Windows programs are divided into one directory for each program (generally), in Unix directories tend to contain specific kinds of files, *regardless* of the program they belong to
2007-09-17T13:12:00.000Z	LjL	vsayikiran	so, executable programs are mostly in /usr/bin, but their icons (for instance) can be in /usr/share
2007-09-17T13:26:00.000Z	LjL	vsayikiran	i just told you
2007-09-17T13:26:00.000Z	LjL	vsayikiran	i also told you it's unnecessary, and won't give you any perceivable speed improvement, but feel free to try
2007-09-25T09:50:00.000Z	LjL	vsayikiran	ctrl+alt+backspace restarts X windows
2007-09-25T09:57:00.000Z	LjL	vsayikiran	i sometimes pull the plug, but that's too generic a question to answer. you have a problem with a screensaver -- then finding out what causes it is the question, not what to do when your PC hangs
2007-10-02T07:23:00.000Z	LjL	vsayikiran	not really, but i know you should install the 'irda-utils' package and edit /etc/default/irda-utils
2007-10-02T07:25:00.000Z	vsayikiran	LjL	does your solutiion work , did you try yourself
2007-10-02T07:25:00.000Z	LjL	vsayikiran	it's not a "solution". it's just installing the standard Linux IrDA stack utils.
2007-10-02T07:26:00.000Z	LjL	vsayikiran	what is certain is that nothing *will* work if you don't install that.
2007-10-02T07:26:00.000Z	LjL	vsayikiran	and, no, i've had many problems with my IrDA, including not being able to transfer files via OBEX. however, if you don't install irda-utils, you're *guaranteed* not to be able to use IrDA at all.
2007-10-02T07:27:00.000Z	vsayikiran	LjL	which laptop model are you using
2007-10-02T07:28:00.000Z	LjL	vsayikiran	i'm not using a laptop. i've got a USB dongle.
2007-10-02T07:32:00.000Z	vsayikiran	LjL	i dont have this file in my pc "/etc/default/irda-utils"
2007-10-02T07:34:00.000Z	LjL	vsayikiran	you should have it *after* installing 'irda-utils'
2007-10-02T07:34:00.000Z	vsayikiran	LjL	ok
