2005-04-25T11:44:00.000Z	shad0w1e		no
2005-04-25T11:44:00.000Z	shad0w1e		ah thanks
2005-04-25T11:45:00.000Z	shad0w1e		wil that also give me a graphical startup screen?
2005-04-25T11:45:00.000Z	shad0w1e		ok after doing this update, all my fonts changed
2005-04-25T11:45:00.000Z	shad0w1e		their nicer now..
2005-04-25T11:46:00.000Z	kkathman	shad0w1e	what did you do to get your fonts nicer ?
2005-04-25T11:47:00.000Z	kkathman	shad0w1e	you should only have to update once really now
2005-04-25T11:48:00.000Z	kkathman	shad0w1e	and even then if you installed from a 5.04 hoary final, that probably doesnt need much at all
2005-04-25T11:49:00.000Z	kkathman	shad0w1e	probably you dont
2005-04-25T11:52:00.000Z	kkathman	shad0w1e	I dont understand why you'd be updating so much
2005-04-25T11:53:00.000Z	kkathman	shad0w1e	what are you updating?
2005-04-25T11:54:00.000Z	kkathman	shad0w1e	you only need to dist-upgrade once
2005-04-25T11:54:00.000Z	kkathman	shad0w1e	ahh ok...well you shouldnt have many updates from now on
2005-04-25T12:00:00.000Z	shad0w1e	kkathman	got a better solution?
2005-04-25T12:04:00.000Z	kkathman	shad0w1e	when you own 95+% of the world's desktops, you kinda dont need to go and get something else :)
2005-04-25T12:05:00.000Z	kkathman	shad0w1e	why do they need to...they have no motivation lol :)
2005-04-25T12:07:00.000Z	kkathman	shad0w1e	linux probably has more of a chance to give mac a run than ms
2005-05-08T11:54:00.000Z	kkathman	shad0w1e	yes, install hoary first, then apt-get kubuntu-desktop
