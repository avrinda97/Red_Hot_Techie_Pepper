2006-09-08T12:30:00.000Z	com4		i want to add a path to PATH for bash, but i can't figure out where that gets set system wide
2006-09-08T12:30:00.000Z	com4		Which file do i edit to update PATH globally?
2006-09-08T12:31:00.000Z	Arafangion	com4	define "globally"
2006-09-08T12:31:00.000Z	com4	Arafangion	system wide
2006-09-08T12:31:00.000Z	Arafangion	com4	For every single user?
2006-09-08T12:31:00.000Z	com4	Arafangion	yes
2006-09-08T12:32:00.000Z	Arafangion	com4	I don't think it's possible, unless you ensure that every users uses bash, and you configure /etc/profile
2006-09-08T12:32:00.000Z	com4	Arafangion	every user uses bash and there's no predefined PATH in /etc/profile
2006-09-08T12:32:00.000Z	Arafangion	com4	Then define it.
2006-09-08T12:32:00.000Z	Arafangion	com4	export PATH=foo;$PATH
2006-09-08T12:33:00.000Z	Arafangion	com4	Use :, not ;, that was a typo.
2006-09-08T12:33:00.000Z	com4	Arafangion	gotcha... just seems like it should already be there. this is comming from slackware/redhat usage though
2006-09-08T12:34:00.000Z	Arafangion	com4	Investigate man bash, and /etc/profile.d
2006-09-08T12:34:00.000Z	com4	Arafangion	usually the profile script will execute everything in /etc/profile.d :)
2006-09-08T12:34:00.000Z	com4	Arafangion	it would seem that's now how debian/ubuntu does it though
2006-09-08T12:35:00.000Z	com4	Arafangion	it also appearse that adding the PATH into /etc/profile doesn't work
2006-09-08T12:36:00.000Z	Arafangion	com4	afaik, most distros have a default .bashrc and .bash_profile in skel
2006-09-08T12:36:00.000Z	com4	Arafangion	debian does have that, and nevermind... i just made the same ;/: typo as you :D
2006-09-08T12:36:00.000Z	com4	Arafangion	thanks
