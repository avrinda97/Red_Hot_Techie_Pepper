2008-04-10T19:31:00.000Z	ChaosTheory^	marx2k	Can you use naim on Ubuntu?
2008-04-10T19:32:00.000Z	marx2k	ChaosTheory^	of course
2008-04-10T19:32:00.000Z	ChaosTheory^	marx2k	Trying it out. =P
2008-04-10T19:32:00.000Z	ChaosTheory^	marx2k	Naim was one of the main reasons I switched to Ubuntu. XD
2008-04-10T19:33:00.000Z	ChaosTheory^	marx2k	Do you know how to fix my problem?
2008-04-10T19:33:00.000Z	marx2k	ChaosTheory^	Im not really sure what your problem is
2008-04-10T19:33:00.000Z	ChaosTheory^	marx2k	I made a new profile in terminal where the menu bar was disabled and I set it as my default. =P
2008-04-10T19:34:00.000Z	ChaosTheory^	marx2k	I want to go back to my default profile.
2008-04-10T19:34:00.000Z	marx2k	ChaosTheory^	not sure. I dont use terminal. when I use naim, I am ssh'ing to my home linux box (like now) via PuTTY
2008-04-10T19:34:00.000Z	ChaosTheory^	marx2k	Oh, I see.
2008-04-10T19:35:00.000Z	ChaosTheory^	marx2k	Actually, I think centerim is pretty easy to use. =P
2008-04-10T19:38:00.000Z	ChaosTheory^	marx2k	Just installed, having the same problem, too.
2008-04-10T19:38:00.000Z	marx2k	ChaosTheory^	weir,d right? I dont get it..
2008-04-10T19:38:00.000Z	ChaosTheory^	marx2k	CenterIM is a better text-based client. =P
2008-04-10T19:42:00.000Z	ChaosTheory^	marx2k	I'm getting blank messages from myself even after uninstall naim.
2008-04-10T19:43:00.000Z	marx2k	ChaosTheory^	Ok... that is REALLY weird.. dont know what to tell you on that one :) You sure it's not running? (Even though you uninstalled it)
2008-04-10T19:43:00.000Z	ChaosTheory^	marx2k	Yes.
2008-04-10T19:43:00.000Z	ChaosTheory^	marx2k	. . . -_-"
