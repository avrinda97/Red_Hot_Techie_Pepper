2010-01-11T17:59:00.000Z	om26er	theadmin	try mkfs.ntfs -f
2010-01-11T18:00:00.000Z	theadmin	om26er	Eh... But that's not the problem. It hangs my computer up when it gets to 47%. Why the heck?
2010-01-11T18:00:00.000Z	om26er	theadmin	might be your hardrive is the problem?
2010-01-11T18:01:00.000Z	theadmin	om26er	It's not a real hard-drive or anything, it's a... eh... file. Kinda. Ever heard of TrueCrypt? So... it's in /dev/mapper/truecrypt1 because I chose to "not mount" it, so I can format it to another filesystem. ext4 and others work fine with this kinda stuff.
2010-03-18T16:00:00.000Z	theadmin	om26er	I dunno, i'm a pidgin user lol

2010-06-07T14:20:00.000Z	theadmin	om26er	Install the "dkms" package, which provides Dynamic KernelModule Support.
2010-06-07T14:20:00.000Z	om26er	theadmin	already the newest version
2010-06-07T14:21:00.000Z	theadmin	om26er	Oh. Hm, well... Then those drivers don't support DKMS and i think you'll have to either keep on reinstalling em or stick to a specific kernel version
