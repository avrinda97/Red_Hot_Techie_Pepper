2008-03-31T02:13:00.000Z	shawnr34		anyone familiar with getting the 3g nano working with rhythmbox or amarok? i'm in need of some assistance
2008-03-31T02:14:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	shawnr34	3g nano?
2008-03-31T02:15:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	shawnr34	not sure how it would do for importing videos.
2008-06-23T06:23:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	shawnr34	don't think so..
2008-06-23T06:24:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	shawnr34	so its connected and mounted, what is the problem?
2008-06-23T06:24:00.000Z	shawnr34	IndyGunFreak	amarok doesn't see it
2008-06-23T06:25:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	shawnr34	so configure amarok to see it.
2008-06-23T06:28:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	shawnr34	if the ipod worked in rhythmbox before you removed it, then the issue isnt' the ipod, its clearly the settings in amarok.
2008-06-23T06:29:00.000Z	shawnr34	IndyGunFreak	thats what i was thinking but can't figure it out...
2008-06-23T06:29:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	shawnr34	open amarok.. and make sure your ipod is plugged in
2008-06-23T06:30:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	shawnr34	do you have your ipod plugged in and amarok open?
2008-06-23T06:30:00.000Z	shawnr34	IndyGunFreak	yes
2008-06-23T06:31:00.000Z	shawnr34	IndyGunFreak	you know what.. i just plugged in my thumbdrive... amarok used to always ask me if it should handle it. it doesn't and its not in the list of avail media devices
2008-06-23T06:32:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	shawnr34	is your ipod plugged in?
2008-06-23T06:32:00.000Z	shawnr34	IndyGunFreak	yes it is
2008-06-23T06:34:00.000Z	shawnr34	IndyGunFreak	amarok is open and plugged in
2008-06-23T06:34:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	shawnr34	ok, did you do what i said?
2008-06-23T06:36:00.000Z	shawnr34	IndyGunFreak	auto-detect says no new media detected
2008-06-23T06:36:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	shawnr34	you'll have to manually mount it in amarok.
