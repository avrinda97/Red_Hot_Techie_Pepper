2004-12-05T11:41:00.000Z	siimo	mdz	yes i understand all that but i still want root
2004-12-05T11:42:00.000Z	mdz	siimo	when I say it is answered in the FAQ, I mean that you will find the answer to your question by reading the FAQ

2004-12-05T11:43:00.000Z	siimo	mdz	that does not say anything about enabling root account
2004-12-05T11:43:00.000Z	mdz	siimo	yes it does
2004-12-05T11:44:00.000Z	siimo	mdz	it only talks about setting a root password which doesnt necessarily mean the account will be enabled as it does not say that anywhere
2004-12-05T11:46:00.000Z	mdz	siimo	perhaps you can suggest an alternative wording which would have made it more obvious
2004-12-05T11:47:00.000Z	siimo	mdz	all im saying is - it should say somewhere that "by setting the root password the root account is enabled" ?
2004-12-05T11:49:00.000Z	mdz	siimo	better now?
