2009-01-16T11:35:00.000Z	Sajuuk		what's the "Gnome Desktop" for apt-get again?
2009-01-16T11:36:00.000Z	ziroday	Sajuuk	you mean the ubuntu desktop and all its settings or just gnome?
2009-01-16T11:37:00.000Z	Sajuuk	ziroday	so yeah, just gnome
2009-01-16T11:39:00.000Z	ziroday	Sajuuk	in that case you want sudo apt-get install gnome. However that is _just_ gnome, nothing else
2009-01-16T11:41:00.000Z	Sajuuk	ziroday	I saw what i did wrong... i didn't have install lol, I have a new problem, the only PC in the house that has a graphis card is my AMD comp... I dont think it will boot up on that processor, and if it gets past that, I have to figure out how to get linux to like my Nvidia 9800gt, unless someone here knows how to transfer my OS to another hdd via command line
2009-01-16T11:42:00.000Z	ziroday	Sajuuk	erm, it should boot up fine on that processor. And then you can install the nvidia drivers
2009-01-16T11:43:00.000Z	Sajuuk	ziroday	where do i find the 9800gt drivers?
2009-01-16T11:43:00.000Z	ziroday	Sajuuk	the same place you find other graphics drivers. In System > Administration > Hardware Drivers
2009-01-16T11:45:00.000Z	Sajuuk	ziroday	if I could do that, I would... im running on command line at the moment until I have gnome installed on my server, why im asking to do it on command line is that I tried booting up with a live session on the 9800gt and it didn't work
2009-01-16T11:46:00.000Z	ziroday	Sajuuk	okay, to install the nvidia drivers from the command line do sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx-177 and then restart X
2009-01-16T11:47:00.000Z	Sajuuk	ziroday	I should also add, that the two comps have 2 diff processors, are you sure that it will be fine?
2009-01-16T11:48:00.000Z	ziroday	Sajuuk	erm you should be doing a fresh install, why don't you just backup your old data and copy it across
2009-01-16T11:48:00.000Z	Sajuuk	ziroday	its running samba stuff and print server that took ages to configure, I don't want to do it again
2009-01-16T11:48:00.000Z	ziroday	Sajuuk	you can copy across the samba.conf files...
2009-01-16T11:51:00.000Z	Sajuuk	ziroday	well live disc boot I can't do cos I will have to do it via my amd machine, although the install is going to be run on the intel machine, and the amd machine is the only one with a graphics card
2009-01-16T11:52:00.000Z	ziroday	Sajuuk	why can't you do live install on the amd machine?
2009-01-16T11:53:00.000Z	Sajuuk	ziroday	it wouldn't load, it complained about the VGA card (9800gt) and then went black then the CD idled and didn't do anything for 15 min
2009-01-16T11:53:00.000Z	ziroday	Sajuuk	right, try in safe graphics mode
2009-01-16T11:54:00.000Z	Sajuuk	ziroday	I think I set that but still no luck
