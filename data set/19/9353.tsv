2007-05-31T05:55:00.000Z	Slart	ph8	in grub?
2007-05-31T05:55:00.000Z	Slart	ph8	it sets the videomode during boot
2007-05-31T05:56:00.000Z	Slart	ph8	I don't know what mode 771 is... there are tables out there on the intarweb
2007-05-31T05:57:00.000Z	Slart	ph8	from one site.. 771 800x600, 8-bit color
2007-05-31T05:58:00.000Z	Slart	ph8	sounds reasonable enough... your computer should be able to handle it.. but if it works without it there's no harm in removing it
2007-09-11T14:38:00.000Z	Slart	ph8	fortunately not =)
2007-09-11T14:39:00.000Z	Slart	ph8	you need the calendar bit or the email bit?
2007-09-11T14:39:00.000Z	Slart	ph8	then thunderbird of evolution will do the trick
2007-09-11T14:42:00.000Z	Slart	ph8	yes
2008-02-25T23:38:00.000Z	Slart	ph8	I think it's the only one.. unfortunately
2008-02-29T01:21:00.000Z	Slart	ph8	what kind of errors do you get if you try to mount it?
2008-02-29T01:22:00.000Z	ph8	Slart	Well, there's no sdc1 so i can't mount it? There are some read errors in dmesg
2008-02-29T01:23:00.000Z	Slart	ph8	well.. if it isn't recognized as a hard drive I doubt you can run fsck on it..
2008-02-29T01:23:00.000Z	Slart	ph8	have you tried running testdisk on it?
2008-02-29T01:25:00.000Z	Slart	ph8	it's the only thing I know of that might be able to see some files.. or tell you what's wrong
2008-03-04T03:50:00.000Z	Slart	ph8	I'd check what module is being used and see if that might be the problem.. perhaps there is an updated module available..
2008-03-04T03:50:00.000Z	Slart	ph8	I've heard of auto-sense creating connection trouble.. but not crashing a machine
2008-03-04T04:11:00.000Z	ph8	Slart	+ bascule: It's a d-link, looked like a really nice card - came with different brackets for server mounting etc, overall quite impressed until now - i believe the entire machine shuts down on error
2008-03-04T04:12:00.000Z	ph8	Slart	+ bascule: I'm using ubuntu-server with the Xen kernel so i can run VPS, so i unfortunately can't be in front of the machine - i tried disabling autoneg and lost the machine and/or connection earlier
