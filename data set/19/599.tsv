2011-12-21T10:32:00.000Z	Captain_Crow		i just did a fresh install of ubuntu 11.10 and updates, is there anything else I need to do before trying to run the cube or other compiz effects? (last few attempts of running the cube caused ubuntu to completely crash every time i rebooted the pc, which is why i had to reinstall)
2011-12-21T10:34:00.000Z	Captain_Crow		should I just run compiz, or is there some prerequisite to keeping ubuntu from crashing and becoming corrupted?
2011-12-21T10:34:00.000Z	DrPenguin	Captain_Crow	ubuntu has compiz in it by default now
2011-12-21T10:55:00.000Z	DrPenguin	Captain_Crow	ccsm &?
2011-12-21T10:56:00.000Z	Captain_Crow	DrPenguin	& what?
2011-12-21T10:56:00.000Z	DrPenguin	Captain_Crow	its just ccsm &
2011-12-21T10:57:00.000Z	DrPenguin	Captain_Crow	just because you istalled the updates it doesnt mean your gonna have a package, jus install the settings mgr.. but it should be in there
2011-12-21T11:07:00.000Z	DrPenguin	Captain_Crow	Why are you worried about "crashing or corrupting the OS"? This isnt Windows
2011-12-21T11:08:00.000Z	DrPenguin	Captain_Crow	Ive NEVER had an issue where Ive broken Ubuntu beyound repair with compiz
2011-12-21T11:10:00.000Z	Captain_Crow	DrPenguin	i couldn't get the desktop to work at all aside from tapping the power button to get the shutdown menu to come up, I had to reinstall ubuntu completely to get it to work again
2011-12-21T11:10:00.000Z	DrPenguin	Captain_Crow	thats not a compiz break, you broke something severely there
2011-12-21T11:11:00.000Z	DrPenguin	Captain_Crow	as I said, your breakin something there.. compiz wouldnt bork your system
2011-12-21T11:15:00.000Z	DrPenguin	Captain_Crow	that doesnt sound like somehting compiz would do.. Did you pay attention to the other things that compiz asked you to do when you enabled cube?
2011-12-21T11:15:00.000Z	DrPenguin	Captain_Crow	what else did you change
2011-12-21T11:15:00.000Z	DrPenguin	Captain_Crow	I call bs, theres no way
2011-12-21T11:18:00.000Z	DrPenguin	Captain_Crow	you can vt switch
2011-12-21T11:37:00.000Z	DrPenguin	Captain_Crow	no
2011-12-21T11:39:00.000Z	Captain_Crow	DrPenguin	what editor should i be using? (maybe im downloading the wrong one im not really sure)
