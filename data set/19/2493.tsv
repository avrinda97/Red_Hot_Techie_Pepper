2012-06-10T15:17:00.000Z	augustl		a process has the parent process with the pid "1". What is that process? Where should I look in order to _not_ have this child process started?
2012-06-10T15:19:00.000Z	augustl		a grep for "wpa" in /etc/init returns nothing, odd
2012-06-10T15:20:00.000Z	augustl		(wpa_supplicant is the name of the process that init starts on boot that I'd like to disable)
2012-06-10T15:21:00.000Z	sacarlson	augustl	I hope it's not a laptop you hope to use to connect to wifi
2012-06-10T15:25:00.000Z	augustl	sacarlson	it is :)
2012-06-10T15:26:00.000Z	augustl	sacarlson	I prefer wpa_supplicant + dhclient in a screen to network-manager
2012-06-10T15:26:00.000Z	sacarlson	augustl	well then I hope all you wifi will never be encrypted
2012-06-10T15:26:00.000Z	augustl	sacarlson	wpa_passphrase "ssid here" "password here" >> ~/Dropbox/wpa_supplicant.conf
2012-06-10T15:26:00.000Z	augustl	sacarlson	:)
2012-06-10T15:27:00.000Z	sacarlson	augustl	well I'm an anti network-manger guy so I'm sure there are other methods
2012-06-10T15:29:00.000Z	augustl	sacarlson	you're not using network-manager? If not, do you also have a wpa_supplicant running when you boot?
2012-06-10T15:29:00.000Z	sacarlson	augustl	no I write scripts or run static in most cases
2012-06-10T15:29:00.000Z	augustl	sacarlson	I see, cool :)
2012-06-10T15:30:00.000Z	augustl	sacarlson	btw, not looking forward to connecting to a wpa2 enterprise network, that's pretty nasty with wpa_supplicant.conf it seems
2012-06-10T15:30:00.000Z	sacarlson	augustl	good point as this is a box that will never touch wifi direct but probly might have wpa_supplicant running
2012-06-10T15:31:00.000Z	augustl	sacarlson	I guess you have then
2012-06-10T15:51:00.000Z	sacarlson	augustl	that's what I ended up doing is uninstalling network-manager package
2012-06-10T15:58:00.000Z	sacarlson	augustl	I just noted that with my wpa-supplicant isn't running so I guess not having network-manager installed has made it go away
2012-06-10T15:58:00.000Z	augustl	sacarlson	yeah I just uninstalled network-manager, it works fine now
