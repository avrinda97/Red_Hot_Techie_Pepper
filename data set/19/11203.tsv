2008-03-09T03:47:00.000Z	Draco		cyphase: gnome and os x, and even kde now are starting to get this mentality
2008-03-09T03:47:00.000Z	cyphase	Draco	how do you figure that?
2008-03-09T03:48:00.000Z	Draco	cyphase	well, osx first. then gnome fell, and kde is going to start falling
2008-03-09T03:48:00.000Z	Draco	cyphase	have you seen some gnome 1.x apps?
2008-03-09T03:48:00.000Z	cyphase	Draco	umm, no :)
2008-03-09T03:49:00.000Z	cyphase	Draco	what about them?
2008-03-09T03:49:00.000Z	Draco	cyphase	old gnome-terminal is actually more useful than the new one
2008-03-09T03:50:00.000Z	cyphase	Draco	that's not really the same thing as what i was talking about
2008-03-09T03:51:00.000Z	Draco	cyphase	you used to have to use the command line to edit menus in gnome2
2008-03-09T03:51:00.000Z	cyphase	Draco	i'm talking about someone wanting to be able to, for example, easily share a printer with windows machines through samba, and being told "you can already do that. just edit this file and that file, and run these commands.."
2008-03-09T03:51:00.000Z	cyphase	Draco	i know
2008-03-09T03:52:00.000Z	Draco	cyphase	well, konqueror already has a way to manage that
2008-03-09T03:52:00.000Z	cyphase	Draco	but do you see my point?
2008-03-09T03:53:00.000Z	Draco	cyphase	yeah, there are a lot of things that just haven't been added to any GUI
2008-03-09T03:53:00.000Z	cyphase	Draco	it's not even that
2008-03-09T03:53:00.000Z	Draco	cyphase	sometimes they are an oversight, other times when it goes 8 or so years without... THEN you can pretty much say they don't care
2008-03-09T03:54:00.000Z	Draco	cyphase	for instance Konqueror has NEVER gotten xslt handling for... 7 years
2008-03-09T03:54:00.000Z	cyphase	Draco	that's just laziness (not to be mean to the konqueror devs)
2008-03-09T03:55:00.000Z	Draco	cyphase	it's worse than laziness, people have spent more time arguing than it would have been taken to add the proper libmagic and set associations
