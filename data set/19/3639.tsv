2010-05-25T07:15:00.000Z	Mrpeepers310		Is anyone here having trouble enabling the nvidia driver?
2010-05-25T07:15:00.000Z	ElTimo	Mrpeepers310	you have to run nvidia-xconfig
2010-05-25T07:16:00.000Z	Mrpeepers310	ElTimo	did that after installing them and activating the current one using jockey
2010-05-25T07:16:00.000Z	Mrpeepers310	ElTimo	still didn't work
2010-05-25T07:16:00.000Z	ElTimo	Mrpeepers310	did you try logging out and back in?
2010-05-25T07:16:00.000Z	Mrpeepers310		ya
2010-05-25T07:17:00.000Z	ElTimo		huh
2010-05-25T07:17:00.000Z	Mrpeepers310	ElTimo	ya i did
2010-05-25T07:17:00.000Z	ElTimo		did you use jockey? or did you do sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx-185?
2010-05-25T07:17:00.000Z	Mrpeepers310	ElTimo	jockey
2010-05-25T07:18:00.000Z	ElTimo	Mrpeepers310	that's why. jockey is a raging piece of shit. do it manually
2010-05-25T07:18:00.000Z	Mrpeepers310	ElTimo	ok good to know. so is version 195 not working?
2010-05-25T07:19:00.000Z	ElTimo	Mrpeepers310	i think for compatibility they kept the package name as -185, but it installs 195 afaik
2010-05-25T07:19:00.000Z	Mrpeepers310	ElTimo	ok thank you for your help
2010-05-25T07:19:00.000Z	ElTimo		don't thank me until it works :P
2010-05-25T07:37:00.000Z	ElTimo		is there any way to get pidgin to use the new tooltip system?
2010-05-25T07:38:00.000Z	Mrpeepers310		ok I am not able to enable nvidia-glx-185 and get the desktop graphics to work. anyone have this same problem?
2010-05-25T07:40:00.000Z	Mrpeepers310		has anyone had trouble installing/ enabling the nvidia driver and getting compiz to start?
2010-05-25T07:41:00.000Z	ElTimo	Mrpeepers310	still no luck?
