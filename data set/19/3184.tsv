2009-10-08T15:45:00.000Z	bazi		oh, usb stick, for them you NEED scsi drivers
2009-10-08T15:46:00.000Z	bazi		this could be the reason for some delays. he must wait for the usb stick
2009-10-08T15:47:00.000Z	bazi		i don't think that you could change anything on this behaviour
2009-10-08T15:48:00.000Z	bazi		sda (4gb medium) is your usb stick, right?
2009-10-08T15:49:00.000Z	naxa	bazi	i also have a boot delay however not like this one. i'm booting from an USB hard drive (not flash) and after hitting enter on ubuntu in grub, but before first "[0.0000021] message" appears (i'm not using splash nor quiet) there is a 20 second delay, what seems to be some timeout for me. any idea what could it be?
2009-10-08T15:50:00.000Z	naxa	bazi	i don't have messages like StaRetji however
2009-10-08T15:50:00.000Z	bazi	naxa	could you paste a log (dmesg)?
2009-10-08T15:50:00.000Z	naxa	bazi	I could but there is no log for that 20 seconds due the kernel is not up
2009-10-08T15:51:00.000Z	bazi	naxa	this means that the first log entry is AFTER the 20 seconds?
2009-10-08T15:51:00.000Z	naxa	bazi	hey, actually it means that i'm not aware what's the real dmesg output! :D i'm pasting it
2009-10-08T15:52:00.000Z	naxa	bazi	however the first message has a timestamp not [20.00000] but [00.00000]
2009-10-08T15:52:00.000Z	bazi	naxa	aaaah now i understand
2009-10-08T15:53:00.000Z	naxa	bazi	http://paste.ubuntu.com/288522/ sorry i meant you
2009-10-08T15:56:00.000Z	bazi	naxa	i think he tries to access the harddisk, to is not a think of linux, more a thing of grub/lilo/{own bootloader}/...
2009-10-08T15:57:00.000Z	naxa	bazi	i use grub
2009-10-08T15:57:00.000Z	naxa	bazi	should i ask it on the grub chanel?
2009-10-08T15:57:00.000Z	bazi	naxa	you could
2009-10-08T16:05:00.000Z	naxa	bazi	thanks for help :)
2009-10-08T16:06:00.000Z	naxa	bazi	anyway 70% of booting my system consists of usb timeouts... :D
