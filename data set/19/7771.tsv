2007-07-29T15:41:00.000Z	azi		i'd like to apt build-essential  but synaptics want me to insert the installation CD :( why is that so?
2007-07-29T15:42:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	azi	you need to remove the cdrom references from /etc/apt/sources.list
2007-07-29T15:42:00.000Z	azi	fyrestrtr	thank you very much
2007-07-29T15:42:00.000Z	azi	fyrestrtr	do you also happen to know if it's possible to downgrade gutsy to feisty?
2007-07-29T15:42:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	azi	no, I'm sorry I don't know about that. If your /home is on another partition, then its easy.
2007-07-29T15:44:00.000Z	azi	fyrestrtr	easy? you mean I could just backup the partition and install feisty?
2007-07-29T15:45:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	azi	why not?
2007-07-29T15:47:00.000Z	azi	fyrestrtr	feisty doesn't work on my new laptop due to unsupported HW
2007-07-29T15:47:00.000Z	azi	fyrestrtr	i'm unable to run the installer
2007-07-29T15:47:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	azi	please be more specific.
