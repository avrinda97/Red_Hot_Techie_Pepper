2009-02-19T20:09:00.000Z	tiredbones		I ran this command -  growisofs -Z /dev/scd0 -speed=1 -iso-level 4 -r /var/dar/home.1.dar    and got his error - /dev/scd0: media is not recognized as recordable DVD: A  -  I'm using distro 8.04. can someone tell me what this error is? I have burn ubuntu iso files with this burner.
2009-02-19T20:11:00.000Z	sipior	tiredbones	is there in fact a recordable dvd in the drive? the error seems pretty clear. you've used this exact command before successfully?
2009-02-19T20:12:00.000Z	tiredbones	sipior	no I have not use this command before. I use sony cd +rw disk. my drive is suppose to write on all media.
2009-02-19T20:14:00.000Z	sipior	tiredbones	could you verify that your userid is a member of the "cdrom" group?
2009-02-19T20:14:00.000Z	tiredbones	sipior	sure.
2009-02-19T20:15:00.000Z	tiredbones	sipior	give me a second.
2009-02-19T20:18:00.000Z	tiredbones	sipior	my sign on is a member of cdrom.
2009-02-19T20:19:00.000Z	tiredbones	sipior	my sign on is a member of cdrom. Here's the entry -  cdrom:x:24:wayne
2009-02-19T20:19:00.000Z	sipior	tiredbones	wait, did you say you were using a *CD* +RW disk?
2009-02-19T20:20:00.000Z	tiredbones	sipior	yes
2009-02-19T20:20:00.000Z	sipior	tiredbones	clearly the drive is expecting a writable dvd disk, yes?
2009-02-19T20:21:00.000Z	tiredbones	sipior	I always used cd+rw, are you saying I now have to use dvd disk.
2009-02-19T20:22:00.000Z	sipior	tiredbones	you've always used cds with growisofs?
2009-02-19T20:23:00.000Z	tiredbones	sipior	not with this command. I'm trying to backup my system using command line tool for the purpose.
2009-02-19T20:24:00.000Z	tiredbones	sipior	I'm tired of trying to get various gui tool for this purpose.
2009-02-19T20:25:00.000Z	sipior	tiredbones	yeah, the growisofs manpage does not mention CD support, and i'm fairly certain the program will fail on them. but if you're backing up a system, surely DVDs are the better choice anyhow? (well, best would be to copy your data to two removable hard drives)
2009-02-19T20:26:00.000Z	tiredbones	sipior	I guess I'll go to staples and buy some dvd +rw.
2009-02-19T20:27:00.000Z	tiredbones	sipior	thanks for your help.
2009-02-19T20:27:00.000Z	sipior	tiredbones	depending on the amount you have to back up, please consider getting two removable hard drives. less money per gigabyte, easier to manage.
