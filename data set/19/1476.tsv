2011-01-12T03:57:00.000Z	nuradin	rubbs	it is a video/audi/text chat
2011-01-12T03:58:00.000Z	rubbs	nuradin	and what are you trying to do with it exactly?
2011-01-12T03:59:00.000Z	nuradin	rubbs	i want to play music in the rooms without taking the mic,
2011-01-12T03:59:00.000Z	rubbs	nuradin	is paltalk configured to use pulseaudio?
2011-01-12T04:00:00.000Z	nuradin	rubbs	i want to play music directly from my soundblaster without the mic
2011-01-12T04:00:00.000Z	nuradin	rubbs	pulseaudio causes error in my squeeze box
2011-01-12T04:01:00.000Z	rubbs	nuradin	I guess I'm not understanding. Are you trying to play music on a second soundcard?
2011-01-12T04:01:00.000Z	nuradin	rubbs	i have alsa
2011-01-12T04:01:00.000Z	nuradin	rubbs	something like using the line in,but not exactly
2011-01-12T04:03:00.000Z	rubbs	nuradin	I'd look into using pulse audio again, but you can use an alsa passthrough command (I can't find it right now) for your squeeze box. Pulse will make it fairly easy for two audio cards
2011-01-12T04:03:00.000Z	nuradin	rubbs	maybe u can help me with getting rid of this error in pulseaudio
2011-01-12T04:05:00.000Z	nuradin	rubbs	pulseaudio says error connection refused and it dies
2011-01-12T04:06:00.000Z	rubbs	nuradin	I'd help more, but I have to leave actually.
2011-01-12T04:06:00.000Z	nuradin	rubbs	ok thanks anyways
2011-01-12T04:06:00.000Z	rubbs	nuradin	try asking a PA question to the room and they may be able to help
2011-01-12T04:06:00.000Z	nuradin	rubbs	ok thanks again
