2009-06-17T05:26:00.000Z	Unpredictable		Can someone help me fix my nvidia drivers. I had a radeon 7000 installed and I pulled it out to put in a geforce 5500 fx card. I installed the drivers hardware told me to 173. I think. The only 2 resolutions I have is 640x480 and some 320 one. Im new to linux and didn't know how to uninstall radeon drivers. Thx
2009-06-17T05:26:00.000Z	cabrey	Unpredictable	use nvidia-settings
2009-06-17T05:27:00.000Z	Unpredictable	cabrey	nvidia settings is what giving me the 2 resolutions only.. Display won't let me use it and suggest nvidia settings.
2009-06-17T05:32:00.000Z	Unpredictable	cabrey	still here?
2009-06-17T05:32:00.000Z	cabrey	Unpredictable	yes
2009-06-17T05:32:00.000Z	Unpredictable	cabrey	did you read the last msg to u?
2009-06-17T05:32:00.000Z	cabrey	Unpredictable	yea i just saw it hold on
2009-06-17T05:33:00.000Z	cabrey	Unpredictable	you want to remove ati's proprietary drivers?
2009-06-17T05:33:00.000Z	Unpredictable	cabrey	yes.
2009-06-17T05:34:00.000Z	cabrey	Unpredictable	wait you said you used a Radeon 7000, so you couldn't have been using the proprietary drivers
2009-06-17T05:34:00.000Z	Unpredictable	cabrey	I had 7000 installed when I installed ubuntu.. So I dunno if it installs it on its own.. I can show u my xorg.conf in paste bin if that helps..
2009-06-17T05:38:00.000Z	Unpredictable	cabrey	heres my xorg.conf and my lspci http://pastebin.com/m6032aa4b and http://pastebin.com/m320a496a
2009-06-17T05:41:00.000Z	Unpredictable	cabrey	I know ur a busy person it seems, but let me know if u have the time to check out the pastebin.. this resolution thing is way too big. and annoying
2009-06-17T05:41:00.000Z	cabrey	Unpredictable	don't worry i can multitask :)
2009-06-17T05:48:00.000Z	Unpredictable	cabrey	should I just try to download the nvidia driver straight from their site instead of using the hardware driver ubuntu recommends such as 173?
2009-06-17T05:49:00.000Z	cabrey	Unpredictable	you can try, but you must uninstall the ubuntu-provided one first
2009-06-17T06:49:00.000Z	Unpredictable	cabrey	u still around
2009-06-17T06:52:00.000Z	cabrey	Unpredictable	yes i'm here
2009-06-17T06:52:00.000Z	Unpredictable	cabrey	Well after installing 173 recommended drivers from hardware, I couldn't get past a resolution of 640x480. I tried installing 173 straight from nvidia and it installed fine, after I rebooted my monitor said Out of Range. I then tried to proceed to fix graphics card to enable default drivers. All I got was blank screen. So here I am fresh format :(
