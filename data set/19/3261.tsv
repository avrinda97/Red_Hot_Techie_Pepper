2010-03-25T13:16:00.000Z	darolu	theadmin	york105, Tru7h's initial problem was GRUB not adding Win7 to the boot list, he had to remove os-prober and edit /etc/grub.d/40_custom to add the entry; and now Windows 7 won't boot
2010-03-30T10:27:00.000Z	theadmin	darolu	Not the name, it looks in description too

2010-05-05T11:16:00.000Z	darolu	theadmin	yeah I just re-read what I said XD now I'm thinking he may have installed grub2 with the apt-get install grub
