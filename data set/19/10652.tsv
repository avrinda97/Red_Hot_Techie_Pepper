2006-11-20T17:19:00.000Z	Zambezi		Which is the best tool to erase DVDRW in Ubuntu? K3B, Gnomebaker doesn't erase the DVD at all.
2006-11-20T09:34:00.000Z	Zambezi		How do I configure the networkssettings in the terminal? I totally forgot and don't have a clue where to begin to look.
2006-11-20T09:35:00.000Z	dabaR	Zambezi	there is a /et/network/interfaces file to configure the interfaces
2006-11-20T09:36:00.000Z	Zambezi	dabaR	MarcN rickyfingers I need to check.
2006-11-20T09:36:00.000Z	Zambezi	dabaR	MarcN rickyfingers I forgot to say it static IP.
2006-11-20T09:37:00.000Z	dabaR	Zambezi	check what?
2006-11-20T09:37:00.000Z	Zambezi	dabaR	In the file what there was for information.
2006-11-20T09:40:00.000Z	dabaR	Zambezi	man /etc/network/interfaces will show you how to set up static IP
2006-11-20T09:41:00.000Z	Zambezi	dabaR	I hate those manuals. I'll try, but it will never work and then I'm there and need to install Windows instead.
2006-11-20T09:43:00.000Z	dabaR	Zambezi	man interfaces, rather
2007-04-12T08:50:00.000Z	dabaR	Zambezi	gnome-cups-add
2007-04-12T08:51:00.000Z	Zambezi	dabaR	I know that, but what about the rest? ;-)
2007-04-12T08:51:00.000Z	dabaR	Zambezi	click the add new printer icon
2007-04-12T08:52:00.000Z	Zambezi	dabaR	But I don't know what I should write. IPP and that shit.
2007-04-12T08:53:00.000Z	dabaR	Zambezi	read some of that.
2007-04-12T08:55:00.000Z	Zambezi	dabaR	There's a problem. The printer is installed on a server without X. Every howto is for install on the same computer. :-/
2007-04-12T09:19:00.000Z	Zambezi	dabaR	I'm feeling helpless. The howtos won't help me at all cause it's made for local computers, not networkcomputers.
2007-04-12T09:20:00.000Z	dabaR	Zambezi	the howto is made for local not networked computers?
2007-04-12T09:22:00.000Z	Zambezi	dabaR	I installed a Brotheprinter on my Dapperserver without X. I managed to print the testpage in the cups (localhost:631). But if stuck when I'm going to add it on my desktop (Feisty with X).
