2008-03-30T11:58:00.000Z	goob	Dam778	what machine?
2008-03-30T11:59:00.000Z	goob	Dam778	yes
2008-03-30T12:00:00.000Z	goob	Dam778	know what soundcard or motherboard?
2008-03-30T12:00:00.000Z	goob	Dam778	i
2008-03-30T12:01:00.000Z	goob	Dam778	brb i'll go look for you
2008-03-30T12:03:00.000Z	goob	Dam778	run 'lspci' in terminal and it will tell you what card you have
2008-03-30T12:03:00.000Z	goob	Dam778	nevermind i see
2008-03-30T12:06:00.000Z	goob	Dam778	try this link - the third post down says how to revert to an older sound driver for that card - are you using an older Thinkpad by any chance?

2008-03-30T12:14:00.000Z	goob	Dam778	it is the location of your sound driver
2008-03-30T12:14:00.000Z	goob	Dam778	- or rather the location of blacklisted ones
2008-03-30T12:17:00.000Z	Dam778	goob	I am completely lost...
2008-03-30T12:17:00.000Z	goob	Dam778	are you familiar with terminal?
2008-03-30T12:22:00.000Z	goob	Dam778	didn't get anywhere with that thread?
2008-03-30T12:23:00.000Z	goob	Dam778	the best i can tell you is to read lots of threads until you find someone that has solved the same problem - but i would try a couple different drivers if possible
2008-03-30T12:27:00.000Z	goob	Dam778	try "sudo gedit /etc/modules.conf"
