2007-04-21T12:33:00.000Z	sarikan		hi there, I can't watch movies over smb in edgy eft, any ideas?
2007-04-21T12:33:00.000Z	Kraeloc	sarikan	we are in the same boat
2007-04-21T12:34:00.000Z	sarikan	Kraeloc	seems like a common thing
2007-04-21T12:34:00.000Z	sarikan	Kraeloc	but no solution from gogole search :(
2007-04-21T12:34:00.000Z	Kraeloc	sarikan	what video player are you using?
2007-04-21T12:34:00.000Z	sarikan	Kraeloc	Totem and mplayer
2007-04-21T12:35:00.000Z	sarikan		Kraeloc:both fail over the network
2007-04-21T12:35:00.000Z	Kraeloc	sarikan	if you stream with vlc on the server machine, it should work fine
2007-04-21T12:35:00.000Z	Kraeloc	sarikan	but it's kind of an awkward solution
2007-04-21T12:35:00.000Z	sarikan		Kraeloc:yep, it's just a windows machine with movies on it
2007-04-21T12:36:00.000Z	sarikan		Kraeloc:and I want to watch them over network
2007-04-21T12:36:00.000Z	sarikan		Kraeloc:a normal requirement?
2007-04-21T12:36:00.000Z	Kraeloc	sarikan	i think there is a way to fully mount a network share as a drive
2007-04-21T12:36:00.000Z	Kraeloc	sarikan	that would make it seem "local"
2007-04-21T12:36:00.000Z	sarikan	Kraeloc	hmmm maybe I try smbmount
2007-04-21T12:37:00.000Z	sarikan		Kraeloc:thanks anyway, seems no one else knows about it
2007-04-21T12:37:00.000Z	sarikan	Kraeloc	bye now
2007-04-21T12:37:00.000Z	Kraeloc	sarikan	bye
2007-04-21T12:46:00.000Z	Kraeloc	sarikan	smbmount FTW
