2005-09-14T12:04:00.000Z	dannym		hmmm, how do I find the source used for a deb file ?
2005-09-14T12:04:00.000Z	dannym		i.e. I have some package installed with synaptic, and want to get back to the source code to mess things
2005-09-14T12:04:00.000Z	deFrysk	dannym	apt-get source
2005-09-14T12:05:00.000Z	deFrysk	dannym	apt-get source -b
2005-09-14T12:08:00.000Z	deFrysk	dannym	apt-get install build-essential
2005-09-14T12:09:00.000Z	deFrysk	dannym	also apt-get install fakeroot (in case build-essential does not provide it)
2005-09-14T12:11:00.000Z	dannym	deFrysk	ok, and next ? :)
2005-09-14T12:12:00.000Z	dannym	deFrysk	I want to patch gtk2 a bit
2005-09-14T12:13:00.000Z	deFrysk	dannym	good luck hehe
2005-09-14T12:13:00.000Z	dannym	deFrysk	i.e. libgtk2.0-0 version 2.8.3-0ubuntu1
2005-09-14T12:13:00.000Z	dannym	deFrysk	i.yeah, the actual task of patching it is easy :)
2005-09-14T12:13:00.000Z	deFrysk	dannym	dunno much about that
2005-09-14T12:13:00.000Z	dannym	deFrysk	however I'm quite new in debian, so I dont how how to make it i.e. prepare the source directory like it did when building the binary package already present
2005-09-14T12:14:00.000Z	deFrysk	dannym	with fakeroot you can make the packages locally , no root needed
2005-09-14T12:15:00.000Z	dannym	deFrysk	ok, will try ... thanks :)
2005-09-14T12:16:00.000Z	deFrysk	dannym	apt-get build-dep <package> install the dependencies needed to be abkle to compile the .deb and install it
2005-09-14T13:19:00.000Z	deFrysk	dannym	than you can also help out :)
