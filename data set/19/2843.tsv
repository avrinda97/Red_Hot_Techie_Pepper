2009-12-21T19:46:00.000Z	richthegeek1		Hi - I'm using 9.10x64 with two monitors, one is rotated CCW, with a 260 GT gfx card. I can't get compiz to enable (desktop effects) and I can't figure out why. Any help?
2009-12-21T19:46:00.000Z	soreau	richthegeek1	Pastebin the output of compiz from your terminal
2009-12-21T19:48:00.000Z	soreau	richthegeek1	Keep it in #compiz
2009-12-21T19:49:00.000Z	richthegeek1	soreau	you are a cunt
2009-12-21T19:49:00.000Z	soreau	richthegeek1	You need to learn how to pastebin
2009-12-21T19:49:00.000Z	richthegeek1	soreau	its short output, no need
2009-12-21T19:50:00.000Z	soreau	richthegeek1	 No it is not short output and yes there is a need
2009-12-21T19:50:00.000Z	richthegeek1	soreau	if it was 300 lines then sure but you're just being petty. I try and get help and you kick me from where I'm getting it?
2009-12-21T19:50:00.000Z	soreau	richthegeek1	You will learn to use a pastebin service
2009-12-21T19:51:00.000Z	richthegeek1	soreau	i know how to use a pastebin, just the channels I frequent are less strict about "X lines is too many". Seriously, arbitrary rules don't help anyone esp when no-one else was talking when i pasted
2009-12-21T19:53:00.000Z	soreau	richthegeek1	I specifically said pastebin and you ignored that not once but twice
2009-12-21T19:53:00.000Z	soreau	richthegeek1	Then you childishly call names. You deserve a ban
2009-12-21T19:54:00.000Z	richthegeek1	soreau	paste/pastebin, easy to confuse. Didn't ignore it twice so much as read once on two channels. You kicked me from where there was someone helping me instaed of this channel? that's just a powertrip on your part
2009-12-21T19:55:00.000Z	soreau	richthegeek1	Paste. Bin. Not Flood
2009-12-21T19:55:00.000Z	richthegeek1	soreau	I'm getting 50% of my lines just about XYZ entered/left the room. This room is flooding faster than the titanic anyway
2009-12-21T19:56:00.000Z	soreau	richthegeek1	Anyway, like adamk told you, using xinerama disables composite extension. use twinview instead
2009-12-21T22:45:00.000Z	richthegeek1	soreau	whats your problem? you speak to people like youve got a stick stuck somewhere... no reason to be so rude all the time
2009-12-21T22:47:00.000Z	soreau	richthegeek1	I thought they showed you how to use /ignore already
2009-12-21T22:47:00.000Z	richthegeek1	soreau	but then I wouldn't have you as a perfect example of everything that is wrong with opensource and internet tough guys
