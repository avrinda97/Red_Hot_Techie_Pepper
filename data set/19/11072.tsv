2007-04-05T06:53:00.000Z	cowbud		hrmm coffee sounds kinda good now
2007-04-05T06:54:00.000Z	cowbud		I am always amazed at how people can find their way into this channel but not to a web browser to google the exact question they ask here
2007-04-05T06:55:00.000Z	duelboot	cowbud	I'm amazed that people in this channel would even say what you just said
2007-04-05T06:55:00.000Z	cowbud	duelboot	really? stick around more
2007-04-05T06:55:00.000Z	duelboot	cowbud	I do, but I actually like helping people rather than making snide comments
2007-04-05T06:56:00.000Z	cowbud	duelboot	hahahha
2007-04-05T06:56:00.000Z	cowbud	duelboot	funny this is the firt time i've seen you chat in here
2007-04-05T06:56:00.000Z	duelboot	cowbud	most are new and don't know what to do...this is their first taste of the Ubuntu community
2007-04-05T06:56:00.000Z	cowbud	duelboot	look spare it, I know, my point was just I would think it would be easier for people to find a browser than an irc channel which typically it is
2007-04-05T06:56:00.000Z	duelboot	cowbud	I've been coming here off and on for over 1.5 years
2007-04-05T06:59:00.000Z	cowbud	duelboot	haha is that supposed to make sense?
2007-04-05T06:59:00.000Z	duelboot	cowbud	as much sense as your web comment...seriously though, not really...just was saying enough
2007-04-05T07:00:00.000Z	cowbud	duelboot	and yet im still lost
2007-04-05T07:00:00.000Z	duelboot	cowbud	it's okay, I'm sure you'll find yourself soon enough
2007-04-05T07:01:00.000Z	cowbud	duelboot	I hope so, maybe you could help me with that this is a help channel after all
2007-04-05T07:01:00.000Z	cowbud	duelboot	how do I check that?
2007-04-05T07:01:00.000Z	cowbud	duelboot	im laughing myself hehehe
