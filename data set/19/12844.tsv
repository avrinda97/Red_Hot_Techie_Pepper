2005-06-27T14:05:00.000Z	HappyFool		i think it has to do with multiple windows being open; i think nautilus also 'remembers' where the windows were for when they're next opened
2005-06-27T14:06:00.000Z	mbirkis	HappyFool	yes remember the places nautilus does
2005-07-08T14:19:00.000Z	mbirkis	HappyFool	you are correct
2005-07-08T14:19:00.000Z	HappyFool	mbirkis	there's something called update-grub which might help you -- depends how you broke it, i guess
2005-07-08T14:20:00.000Z	mbirkis	HappyFool	ok... where do i use update-grub? as an boot option from the cd?
2005-07-08T14:21:00.000Z	HappyFool	mbirkis	no, a shell command
2005-07-08T14:21:00.000Z	mbirkis	HappyFool	but i can't reach my shell... my grub is broken, and i cannot boot...
2005-07-08T14:21:00.000Z	HappyFool	mbirkis	ah
2005-07-08T14:25:00.000Z	HappyFool	mbirkis	it should be doable
2005-07-08T14:26:00.000Z	HappyFool	mbirkis	what happens when you boot ?
2005-07-08T14:26:00.000Z	mbirkis	HappyFool	without cd?
2005-07-08T14:26:00.000Z	HappyFool	mbirkis	yeah
2005-07-08T14:26:00.000Z	mbirkis	HappyFool	i broke it when i was installing windows xp
2005-07-08T14:26:00.000Z	HappyFool	mbirkis	ah-ha
2005-07-08T14:27:00.000Z	HappyFool	mbirkis	there seems to be a wiki page related to this
2005-07-08T14:27:00.000Z	HappyFool	mbirkis	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows
2005-07-08T14:27:00.000Z	mbirkis	HappyFool	thnx will check it out...
2005-07-08T14:29:00.000Z	mbirkis	HappyFool	the wiki page tells me i need a live cd... i don't have a live cd :(
2005-07-08T14:30:00.000Z	HappyFool	mbirkis	i think you can start the install cd, and then use Ctl-Alt-F2 to switch to a console
