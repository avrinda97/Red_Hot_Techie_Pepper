2007-09-05T07:15:00.000Z	rm130		Is there some program that can detect if I have the right drivers or not for my computer?
2007-09-05T07:15:00.000Z	rm130		 similar to driver genius for windows
2007-09-05T07:15:00.000Z	rm130		because I'm pretty sure I don't have the correct drivers for this machine's video card
2007-09-05T07:16:00.000Z	rm130		it's an intergrated card
2007-09-05T07:17:00.000Z	rm130		how can I check?
2007-09-05T07:18:00.000Z	rm130		!paste
2007-09-05T07:19:00.000Z	rm130		why does it say access denied?
2007-09-05T07:20:00.000Z	rm130		Everything was working fine before I reinstalled OS on the computer
2007-09-05T07:20:00.000Z	rm130		now like I can't do anything 3D
2007-09-05T07:21:00.000Z	Vlet	rm130	run it using sudo
2007-09-05T07:22:00.000Z	rm130		ok
2007-09-05T07:22:00.000Z	Vlet	rm130	what are you trying to run?
2007-09-05T07:22:00.000Z	rm130	Vlet	lspci -v

2007-09-05T07:22:00.000Z	rm130		thanks renzo17
2007-09-05T07:22:00.000Z	rm130	Vlet	it says  Capabilities: <access denied> under some stuff
2007-09-05T07:22:00.000Z	Vlet	rm130	yeah, I guess you need to run that as: sudo lspci -v
2007-09-05T07:23:00.000Z	Vlet	rm130	that likely means that regular users do not have the rights to probe hardware for certain things - doesn't necessarily mean you can't use em for 3d apps
2007-09-05T07:24:00.000Z	rm130	Vlet	renzo17, here is the more complete lspci -v http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36429/
