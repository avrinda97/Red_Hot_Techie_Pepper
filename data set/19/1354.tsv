2011-02-17T10:12:00.000Z	KXTwo		Hello everyone
2011-02-17T10:12:00.000Z	KXTwo		ubuntu novice here
2011-02-17T10:12:00.000Z	KXTwo		had a question about swappiness
2011-02-17T10:13:00.000Z	gaelfx	KXTwo	usually the swap partition should be double what your physical RAM is
2011-02-17T10:13:00.000Z	gaelfx	KXTwo	at the very least, a little larger
2011-02-17T10:17:00.000Z	gaelfx	KXTwo	well, I think the only place where you might notice any difference is if you're running a lot of different apps and changing between them pretty often
2011-02-17T10:25:00.000Z	gaelfx	KXTwo	probably gparted, that's on the livecd
2011-02-17T10:26:00.000Z	KXTwo	gaelfx	are you showing up colored because you typed my name?
2011-02-17T10:26:00.000Z	KXTwo	gaelfx	thanks for the help
2011-02-17T10:26:00.000Z	gaelfx	KXTwo	no prob
2011-02-17T10:31:00.000Z	gaelfx	KXTwo	actually, using Pidgin on a non-linux compy
2011-02-17T10:31:00.000Z	gaelfx	KXTwo	it shouldn't be a big deal, especially since you have plenty of RAM and aren't running heavy programs
2011-02-17T10:32:00.000Z	gaelfx	KXTwo	yeah, not so great on Ubuntu atm
2011-02-17T10:53:00.000Z	gaelfx	KXTwo	well, I believe the windows partitions are shown because they are not mounted by default, and they are outside of the linux part of the computer
2011-02-17T10:54:00.000Z	KXTwo	gaelfx	no they are mounted
2011-02-17T10:55:00.000Z	gaelfx	KXTwo	oooooooooooh, gotcha. Indeed, very strange
2011-02-17T10:56:00.000Z	KXTwo	gaelfx	this might be a learningn opportunity, is there a simple way I could send you a screen shot?  I thought I used to do tht on here back in the day
2011-02-17T10:56:00.000Z	gaelfx	KXTwo	er, probably, but I can't remember how :P
2011-02-17T11:17:00.000Z	gaelfx	KXTwo	that or Chrome
