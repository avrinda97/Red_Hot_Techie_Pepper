2010-04-12T08:06:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	rgs_	When you switch to gtkpod its best to totally start from scratch the itunes db and all.
2010-04-12T08:06:00.000Z	rgs_	LinuxGuy2009	how do i reset the itunes db from iPod?
2010-04-12T08:06:00.000Z	rgs_	LinuxGuy2009	sorry, from gtkpod
2010-04-12T08:06:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	rgs_	format it. Itll recreate the whole file system when the ipod restarts.
2010-04-12T08:07:00.000Z	rgs_	LinuxGuy2009	mkfs.vfat ?
2010-04-12T08:07:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	rgs_	no idea. I usually just use gparted
2010-04-12T08:08:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	rgs_	or you can browse to it in nautilus and throw everything away in it.
