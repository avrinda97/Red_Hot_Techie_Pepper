2007-02-11T09:22:00.000Z	Anomal1		i've just installed ubuntu, but i can't get it to boot: about 40% of the way in, I get an error: Bug: Soft lockup detected on CPU#0
2007-02-11T09:22:00.000Z	Anomal1		anyone know how I can fix this?
2007-02-11T09:23:00.000Z	ikonia	Anomal1	you using core 2 ?
2007-02-11T09:23:00.000Z	Anomal1	ikonia	what's that? :/
2007-02-11T09:23:00.000Z	ikonia	Anomal1	intel core2 chip
2007-02-11T09:24:00.000Z	ikonia	Anomal1	what versiono of ubuntu
2007-02-11T09:24:00.000Z	ikonia	Anomal1	some of the core2 chipsets arn't supported yet, (that I'm aware of)
2007-02-11T09:25:00.000Z	Anomal1	ikonia	well, I had xubuntu installed last week, and that worked fine :/
2007-02-11T09:25:00.000Z	ikonia	Anomal1	really ? same version ?
2007-02-11T09:25:00.000Z	Anomal1	ikonia	yes
2007-02-11T09:25:00.000Z	ikonia	Anomal1	thats VERY strange
2007-02-11T09:28:00.000Z	Anomal1	ikonia	so, any ideas? :(
2007-02-11T09:29:00.000Z	ikonia	Anomal1	well, that error is basiclly suggesting that there is a problem with your cpu, the most common is because its not supported so either you have a problem with you cpu - or your using a different version of ubuntu
2007-02-11T09:29:00.000Z	Anomal1	ikonia	hum, ok.
2007-02-11T09:44:00.000Z	Anomal1	ikonia	:)
2007-02-11T09:44:00.000Z	ikonia	Anomal1	great, thats the problem
2007-02-11T09:44:00.000Z	Anomal1	ikonia	huh? what's the problem? :S
2007-02-11T09:44:00.000Z	ikonia	Anomal1	the fix
2007-02-11T09:45:00.000Z	ikonia	Anomal1	sorry I was asking what the fix was
