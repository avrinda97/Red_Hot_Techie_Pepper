2007-02-09T13:06:00.000Z	duckdown	cafuego_	it should be blocking everything, i keep seeing some DROP'ed attempts in the syslog
2007-02-09T13:06:00.000Z	cafuego_	duckdown	As long as they're dropped that's fine :-)
2007-02-09T13:07:00.000Z	cafuego_	duckdown	if it makes you sleep better at night, why not?  :-)
2007-02-09T13:07:00.000Z	duckdown	cafuego_	it does :D  what syntax would I use for that then?
2007-02-09T13:08:00.000Z	cafuego_	duckdown	sudo iptables -I <chain> <position> -s <ip address> -j REJECT --reject-with icmp-host-prohibited
2007-02-09T13:09:00.000Z	cafuego_	duckdown	I tend to make a chain called MORONS and route traffic through that first, so I justa dd such probles to the MORONS table.
2007-02-09T13:11:00.000Z	cafuego_	duckdown	There are some automated tools that keep an eye on your kernel logs and modify iptables blacklists as required.
2007-02-09T13:14:00.000Z	cafuego_	duckdown	Allow the BNC *only* for your friends IP (range)
2007-02-09T13:14:00.000Z	duckdown	cafuego_	some of them are dynamic, some of them connect from work, etc
2007-02-09T13:15:00.000Z	cafuego_	duckdown	Dynamic are only at mosta  /16 usually. Work would have a specific IP range too.
2007-02-09T13:15:00.000Z	cafuego_	duckdown	more or less - check /usr/share/doc/iptables/html   :-)
2007-02-09T13:16:00.000Z	cafuego_	duckdown	For stuff like that I prefer to only allow ssh (with a certificate) and tunnel other sruff via that ssh connection.
2007-02-09T13:17:00.000Z	cafuego_	duckdown	sudo iptables -I INPUT 1 -s <source ip> -j REJECT
2007-02-09T13:17:00.000Z	duckdown	cafuego_	thanks alot man, much appreciated
2007-02-09T13:17:00.000Z	cafuego_	duckdown	That will insert that rule as #1 in the INPUT chain.
2007-02-09T13:19:00.000Z	cafuego_	duckdown	Some MS exploit probably.
2007-02-09T13:21:00.000Z	cafuego_	duckdown	Check the first half of "Microsoft netmeeting" and then ask again whether it might be exploitable ;-)
2007-02-09T13:21:00.000Z	cafuego_	duckdown	vnc is *really* best tunneled over ssh.
