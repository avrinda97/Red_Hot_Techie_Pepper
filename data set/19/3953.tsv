2011-05-27T00:43:00.000Z	lethu		plz can I have some help with mpd ?
2011-05-27T00:44:00.000Z	VCoolio	lethu	it's just a config file, but apparantly apt-get misses it; create an empty file named /etc/mpd.conf and try again
2011-05-27T00:45:00.000Z	VCoolio	lethu	sudo touch /etc/mpd.conf
2011-05-27T00:46:00.000Z	lethu	VCoolio	I have tried that and now I get "* /etc/mpd.conf must have pid_file set; cannot stop daemon." when I try removing it and it exits with error
2011-05-27T00:48:00.000Z	VCoolio	lethu	^
2011-05-27T00:49:00.000Z	lethu	VCoolio	I get this "5177  4163  0 20:48 pts/1    00:00:00 grep --color=auto mpd"
2011-05-27T00:50:00.000Z	VCoolio	lethu	so mpd is not running? try to add a line like this in /etc/mpd.conf: pid_file "/tmp/mpd.pid"
2011-05-27T00:50:00.000Z	lethu	VCoolio	ok let me try
2011-05-27T00:51:00.000Z	VCoolio	lethu	it seems it should be like this: pid_file "/var/run/mpd/pid"
2011-05-27T00:52:00.000Z	lethu	VCoolio	it worked, thank you lots :)
2011-05-27T00:53:00.000Z	VCoolio	lethu	no problem
2011-05-27T00:54:00.000Z	VCoolio	lethu	with this config mpd won't work btw, so reinstall and create a proper config; have fun, mpd is the best
2011-05-27T00:55:00.000Z	lethu	VCoolio	thanks, yeah I have removed/purged it, now I am doing a new install
2011-05-30T02:31:00.000Z	VCoolio	lethu	that's from two years ago, don't use that
2011-05-30T02:32:00.000Z	lethu	VCoolio	oh ok, what shall I use ?
