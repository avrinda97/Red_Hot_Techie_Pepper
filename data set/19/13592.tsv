2005-03-01T06:35:00.000Z	pauldaoust		now this is curious: has anyone encountered this problem? Whenever I have Firefox running, and click my Firefox icon in the panel, it does that stupid 'open another profile' thingy.
2005-03-01T06:35:00.000Z	pauldaoust		I've had that problem a lot, and i know I can delete the 'lock' file in my ~/.mozilla/firefox/default directory... but even that's not working anymore.
2005-03-01T06:37:00.000Z	pauldaoust		sooooo... nobody with this problem?
2005-03-01T06:37:00.000Z	moquist	pauldaoust	I don't use Gnome, so I don't click on anything.  Sorry.  :|
2005-03-01T06:37:00.000Z	pauldaoust	moquist	serious?
2005-03-01T06:37:00.000Z	moquist	pauldaoust	ion2.  I type "firefox" in a terminal and away I go.  :)
2005-03-01T06:38:00.000Z	moquist	pauldaoust	yep.
2005-03-01T06:38:00.000Z	moquist	pauldaoust	WRT your problem, though, I think it's a rather terrible usability problem that FF needs to fix.
2005-03-01T06:39:00.000Z	pauldaoust	moquist	hear hear. I don't know why this would be such a headache...
2005-03-01T06:39:00.000Z	moquist	pauldaoust	asking the user about that sort of profile junk is a tremendous bother, as you've found.  (*especially* on Linux, where each user has his/her own home directory with his/her own FF profile, etc.)
2005-03-01T06:39:00.000Z	pauldaoust	moquist	too true
2005-03-01T06:40:00.000Z	moquist	pauldaoust	as far as I understand it moz and ff try to do some magic to re-use their already-running sessions if any are found.  perhaps you have some hung/zombie/runaway FF processes hanging around?
2005-03-01T06:40:00.000Z	moquist	pauldaoust	you comfortable on the command line?
2005-03-01T06:40:00.000Z	pauldaoust	moquist	perhaps... hm, let me check
2005-03-01T06:41:00.000Z	pauldaoust	moquist	oh yeah, like I said, I have a no-X Ubuntu machine in the other room
2005-03-01T06:41:00.000Z	moquist	pauldaoust	k.  That'll make this easier.  :)
2005-03-01T06:43:00.000Z	pauldaoust	moquist	ha, that's exactly what it was
2005-03-01T06:43:00.000Z	moquist	pauldaoust	cool.  glad I could help even though I don't use Gnome.  ;)
2005-03-01T06:44:00.000Z	moquist	pauldaoust	I've done the same thing.
