2005-06-24T12:04:00.000Z	synd_	cthulfuego	of course, Tiger wont run very well on an older G3.
2005-06-24T12:06:00.000Z	synd_	cthulfuego	but, older versions of OS X, the ones designed with the G3's in mind, will run fine. I admit, Linux sure would run faster, but theres a bunch of other factors than just speed.
2005-06-24T13:22:00.000Z	synd_	cthulfuego	how about you give an example
2005-06-24T13:22:00.000Z	cthulfuego	synd_	Of what?
2005-06-24T13:22:00.000Z	synd_	cthulfuego	your music prefs
2005-06-24T13:49:00.000Z	synd_	cthulfuego	whats that ubotu topic for internet sharing?
2005-06-24T13:50:00.000Z	synd_	cthulfuego	think that would work for wlan0 to eth0 ?
2005-06-24T13:50:00.000Z	cthulfuego	synd_	yes
2005-06-24T13:50:00.000Z	cthulfuego	synd_	That works for any set of more than one network interfaces
2005-06-24T13:50:00.000Z	synd_	cthulfuego	so, i can take my incoming connection (from wlan0) and output it thru eth0?
2005-06-24T13:51:00.000Z	synd_	cthulfuego	while still maintaining my wlan0 connection, of course
2005-06-24T13:53:00.000Z	cthulfuego	synd_	yes
2005-06-24T14:07:00.000Z	synd_	cthulfuego	is ubotu running on ubuntu?
2005-06-24T14:07:00.000Z	cthulfuego	synd_	No, on Debian sarge ;-)
2005-06-24T14:11:00.000Z	synd_	cthulfuego	sounds like ubotu's got a good life
2005-06-24T14:12:00.000Z	cthulfuego	synd_	1970's fridge sized pre-DOS computers.
2005-06-24T14:15:00.000Z	cthulfuego	synd_	ubotu is already smarter then most redhat users. What else do you want?
2005-06-24T14:16:00.000Z	synd_	cthulfuego	does that mean its smarter than win users as well?
2005-06-24T14:16:00.000Z	cthulfuego	synd_	cabbages are smarter than windows users.
