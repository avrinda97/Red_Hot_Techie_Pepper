2005-02-15T06:22:00.000Z	socketbind		clamav, but there isn't much native viruses that works properly hizz!
2005-02-15T06:22:00.000Z	socketbind		they're just too specific to the system
2005-02-15T06:23:00.000Z	socketbind		i still don't get it

2005-02-15T06:25:00.000Z	housetier	socketbind	what printer do you have?
2005-02-15T06:26:00.000Z	housetier	socketbind	that's a laser printer?
2005-02-15T06:27:00.000Z	housetier	socketbind	are ALL printjobs cancelled or just some?
2005-02-15T06:30:00.000Z	housetier	socketbind	what kind of documents are those cancelled jobs? just pages from, say, openoffice, or pdf files, or...
2005-02-15T06:33:00.000Z	housetier	socketbind	on a side note, the word you were looking for was "fed" :)
2005-02-15T06:36:00.000Z	housetier	socketbind	so it seems something in cupsys-bsd does not work the way it should
2005-02-15T06:36:00.000Z	housetier	socketbind	as I don't know the real cause maybe we can come up with a workaround for the time being
2005-02-15T06:37:00.000Z	housetier	socketbind	you could create pdf files "by hand" and print them from gpdf
2005-02-15T06:38:00.000Z	housetier	socketbind	I open any pdf and click on the "print" icon yes, then I select the network printer and print it
