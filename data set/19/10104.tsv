2008-08-01T09:19:00.000Z	nickrud		Johnny nautilus is what displays the icons; when you run with --no-desktop there will be no icons
2008-08-01T09:20:00.000Z	nickrud		Johnny precisely. If you run nautilus  without --no-desktop, you get icons.
2008-08-01T09:21:00.000Z	Johnny	nickrud	i had it set to use oxygen icons and now i dont know how
2008-08-01T09:21:00.000Z	Johnny		it went on top of awesome Blaqlight
2008-08-01T09:21:00.000Z	Johnny		i couldnt get to the terminal
2008-08-01T09:22:00.000Z	Johnny		and i couldnt open anything
2008-08-01T09:22:00.000Z	nickrud		Johnny I repeat: when nautilus draws the desktop, you get icons. Now, if you use some other desktop manager, that may be setting your icons
2008-08-01T09:22:00.000Z	nickrud		yeah, gnome-session starts a window manager and all

2008-08-01T09:23:00.000Z	Johnny		i just want to replace the folder icons in nautilus --no-desktop from the standard ones to the ones i had it set for
2008-08-01T09:23:00.000Z	Johnny		i had it just a second ago
2008-08-01T09:23:00.000Z	nickrud		Johnny oh, the icons <inside> of nautilus, not on the desktop
2008-08-01T09:24:00.000Z	Johnny		yea
2008-08-01T09:24:00.000Z	nickrud		Johnny iirc, you can start gnome-settings-daemon but I'm not sure
2008-08-01T09:24:00.000Z	nickrud	notsonerdysunny	sudo mv /etc/rc2.d/S30gdm /etc/rc2.d/K30gdm
2008-08-01T09:26:00.000Z	Johnny		is there an app to change the icons in my gtk icons in a light window manger
2008-08-01T09:27:00.000Z	nickrud		Johnny you can set an icon theme with gconf-editor /desktop/gnome/interface/icon_theme .
2008-08-01T09:28:00.000Z	Johnny		its already set to the theme i want Nick_
