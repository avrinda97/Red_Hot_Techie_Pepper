2009-04-22T01:03:00.000Z	Clopin		Hey guys, is it possible to update my OpenGL?
2009-04-22T01:04:00.000Z	crdlb	Clopin	what exactly does that mean? what driver are you using?
2009-04-22T01:04:00.000Z	Clopin	crdlb	Offical Nvidia 180.44
2009-04-22T01:06:00.000Z	crdlb	Clopin	you should already have it, there's really nothing to update ...
2009-04-22T01:06:00.000Z	crdlb	Clopin	the nvidia driver has supported opengl 2.x for years
2009-04-22T01:06:00.000Z	Clopin	crdlb	Well I did glxinfo in terminal and it says I got 1.4
2009-04-22T01:07:00.000Z	crdlb	Clopin	for what line, precisely?
2009-04-22T01:07:00.000Z	Clopin	crdlb	Ubuntu 32bit.
2009-04-22T01:07:00.000Z	Clopin	crdlb	glxinfo|more gives me this (and a lot more) server glx version string: 1.4
2009-04-22T01:08:00.000Z	crdlb	Clopin	glx != gl
2009-04-22T01:08:00.000Z	Clopin	crdlb	Hmm, glx is no command I'm afraid.
2009-04-22T01:08:00.000Z	crdlb	Clopin	look at the OpenGL version string
2009-04-22T01:09:00.000Z	crdlb	Clopin	I said "glx does not equal gl" :)
2009-04-22T01:09:00.000Z	Clopin	crdlb	Oh lol, sorry :D Of course not,
2009-04-22T01:10:00.000Z	Clopin	crdlb	Okay, so I've just checked the opengl string, and I'm embarresed. It says 3.0.0 (:. But for some reason, Savage 2 still doesnt work.
2009-04-22T01:12:00.000Z	crdlb	Clopin	is that running in wine or is it native?
2009-04-22T01:12:00.000Z	Clopin	crdlb	Native, if that = linux versino.
2009-04-22T01:13:00.000Z	crdlb	Clopin	in what way doesn't it work? have you tried running it in a terminal?
2009-04-22T01:14:00.000Z	Clopin	crdlb	Aye, that's why I know what the error could be. But I've just read that I might to have update it. Ill look a bit more into that. Thanks mate.
