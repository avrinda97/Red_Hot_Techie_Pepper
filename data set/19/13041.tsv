2006-12-27T17:15:00.000Z	Madpilot	Eclypse	be glad you can't use automatix. It's a good way to break your system.
2006-12-27T17:16:00.000Z	Madpilot	Eclypse	excuse me?
2006-12-27T17:18:00.000Z	Madpilot	Eclypse	regulars on this channel have seen too many systems broken by autobreakitz, and too much bad attitude from the dev team of the thing... hence the default 'avoid entirely' attitude here...
2006-12-27T17:21:00.000Z	Madpilot	Eclypse	if your issue is with Automatix, then #automatix is probably a better channel for you than #ubuntu...
2006-12-27T17:22:00.000Z	Madpilot	Eclypse	which repos?
2006-12-27T17:23:00.000Z	Madpilot	Eclypse	can you pastebin your sources.list?
2006-12-27T17:29:00.000Z	Madpilot	Eclypse	which of those repos isn't authenticating?
2006-12-27T17:30:00.000Z	Madpilot	Eclypse	odd. you've got a standard repo set except for the automatix & wine ones - you probably need to add the keys for either/both of them
2006-12-27T17:31:00.000Z	Madpilot	Eclypse	let me find you a link, it's been ages since I've added keys manually for repos...
2006-12-27T17:33:00.000Z	Madpilot	Eclypse	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/Ubuntu
2006-12-27T17:33:00.000Z	Madpilot	Eclypse	scroll down to the 'Managing Keys' section
2006-12-27T17:34:00.000Z	Madpilot	Eclypse	no idea, I still don't run Edgy myself
2006-12-27T17:36:00.000Z	Madpilot	Eclypse	the URL I gave you does?
2006-12-27T17:38:00.000Z	Madpilot	Eclypse	which repos' key is that?
2006-12-27T17:39:00.000Z	Madpilot	Eclypse	on the URL I gave you? Any keys on there will probably be for demonstration purposes
2006-12-27T17:39:00.000Z	Madpilot	Eclypse	the various 3rd-party repos you've added should have their keys listed
2006-12-27T17:40:00.000Z	Madpilot	Eclypse	automatix doesn't have it's repo keys listed on it's website somewhere?
2006-12-27T17:41:00.000Z	Madpilot	Eclypse	that and the wine repo keys, those are the ones I bet you'll need. Ubuntu should have all of it's own repo keys already for the official repos you use
2006-12-27T17:46:00.000Z	Madpilot	Eclypse	got apt working now?
