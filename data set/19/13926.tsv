2004-12-12T16:15:00.000Z	colombre		but I'm new to mac
2004-12-12T16:15:00.000Z	colombre		how can I do please?
2004-12-12T16:16:00.000Z	Felix_the_Mac	colombre	I have dual boot on my PowerBook, lets talk!
2004-12-12T16:17:00.000Z	Felix_the_Mac	colombre	Great! The rest is easy ... honestly
2004-12-12T16:17:00.000Z	Felix_the_Mac	colombre	have you downloaded the ubuntu ISOs?
2004-12-12T16:18:00.000Z	Felix_the_Mac	colombre	Sorry no, I was thinking about yellow dog. One is good.
2004-12-12T16:22:00.000Z	Felix_the_Mac	colombre	I am new at IRC. I dont know how this DCC chat thing works in my client!!!
2004-12-12T16:24:00.000Z	Felix_the_Mac	colombre	do you know how to burn the ISO so that it is bootable?
2004-12-12T16:24:00.000Z	Felix_the_Mac	colombre	I use cdrecord
2004-12-12T16:25:00.000Z	Felix_the_Mac	colombre	Oh ... I was very pleased when you said you could do it :-(
2004-12-12T16:28:00.000Z	Felix_the_Mac	colombre	I reinstalled OS X and made a special partition ready for linux
2004-12-12T16:29:00.000Z	Felix_the_Mac	colombre	obviously this can be a bit of a drag
2004-12-12T16:29:00.000Z	Felix_the_Mac	colombre	otherwise there a various tools available such a iPartition which I have just read about.
2004-12-12T16:30:00.000Z	Felix_the_Mac	colombre	also VolumeWorks from subrosasoft
2004-12-12T16:32:00.000Z	Felix_the_Mac	colombre	unfortunately not because. When I had a blank partition on my main disk it would not even let me _format_ it!!
2004-12-12T16:33:00.000Z	Felix_the_Mac	colombre	Check your DCC chat window :-)
2004-12-12T16:33:00.000Z	Felix_the_Mac	colombre	and /me go somewhere quiet to talk
