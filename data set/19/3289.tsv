2010-07-29T19:30:00.000Z	cgroza	ActionParsnip	its not an app, its just a keyword used to troubleshoot my firefox
2010-09-15T06:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cgroza	should be ran at login, not startup
2010-09-15T06:53:00.000Z	cgroza	ActionParsnip	whats the difference?
2010-09-15T06:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cgroza	the startup stuff starts before the login screen. There is a list of use apps which run at logon too, the startup stuff runs as root
2010-09-15T06:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cgroza	if it needs root then add it to /etc/rc.local    above the exit 0 line. If its a command to run after login add a reference to it in System -> preferences -> Startup items
2010-09-15T06:57:00.000Z	cgroza	ActionParsnip	no , it must be run as regular user. Thanks. You Helped me a lot.
2010-09-15T06:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cgroza	no worries duder
