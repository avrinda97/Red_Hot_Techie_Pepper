2011-05-05T04:44:00.000Z	gregL	gonzalo_	Did you look under places and see if it was recognized,but not mounted
2011-05-05T04:45:00.000Z	gonzalo_	gregL	I'll both ideas right away
2011-05-05T04:50:00.000Z	gonzalo_	gregL	How do I look in Places to see if it was recognized?
2011-05-05T04:51:00.000Z	gregL	gonzalo_	no clue I am not using 11.04,sorry
2011-05-05T04:52:00.000Z	gonzalo_	gregL	And is there an equivalent to "My Computer"?
2011-05-05T04:53:00.000Z	gregL	gonzalo_	Yes, It would have been under Places..
2011-05-05T04:53:00.000Z	gonzalo_	gregL	oops... I'll look
2011-05-05T04:55:00.000Z	gonzalo_	gregL	I opened any folder and I found an icon at the top that looks like a computer... that opened My Computer. I see LGE Android Device.
2011-05-05T04:56:00.000Z	gregL	gonzalo_	you should be able to right click and choose mount..
2011-05-05T04:57:00.000Z	gonzalo_	gregL	Sadly, there is no option to mount. My cellphone is asking me to "Turn on USB storage"
2011-05-05T04:58:00.000Z	gonzalo_	gregL	However, I don't want to use it as a mass storage device.

2011-05-05T04:58:00.000Z	gonzalo_	gregL	But at least now I know it was recognized, so thanks!

2011-05-05T04:59:00.000Z	gonzalo_	gregL	And I want to load a HelloWorld Android App onto my cellphone
