2008-03-14T05:51:00.000Z	scall		I am having such a hard time getting my domain name to forward to the proper folder. I have created the necessary config files in sites-available and sites-enabled and restarted apache but my domain name still points to the www folder instead of www/mydomainname/. Any suggestions?
2008-03-14T05:53:00.000Z	scall		No. The tutorials don't mention that.
2008-03-14T05:55:00.000Z	genii	scall	Since version 2 httpd.conf is deprecated. Use instead /etc/apache2/apache2.conf or /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default

2008-03-14T06:06:00.000Z	scall	genii	I can't find anything in apache2.conf that needs to be changed. Can you point me in the right direction?
2008-03-14T06:07:00.000Z	genii	scall	Please say again what it is you wish to configure/do, I missed it previously
2008-03-14T06:08:00.000Z	scall	genii	I want to set up virtual hosts. My domain name resolves to the IP Address of my server but in the browser I just get /var/www instead of /var/www/mydomainname.
2008-03-14T06:09:00.000Z	scall	genii	I have created the necessary config files in sites-available and sites-enabled but it is not working still.
2008-03-14T06:09:00.000Z	genii	scall	Did you reload/restart apache2 ?
2008-03-14T06:09:00.000Z	scall		Yes.
2008-03-14T06:10:00.000Z	scall	genii	Yes and there were no errors.
2008-03-14T06:10:00.000Z	genii	scall	I don't understand what you mean by seeing /var/www in the browser. If you point a web browser to the ip/name you should see all BELOW that directory
2008-03-14T06:12:00.000Z	scall	genii	Yes but I am trying to set it up so that domainone.com goes to one folder and domaintwo.com goes to another. They all go to /var/www instead of them each going to /var/www/domainone and /var/www/domaintwo
2008-03-14T06:12:00.000Z	genii	scall	If you have an alias/virtual host entry in 000-default for example, there will not be a directory which is named /var/www/virtualname unless the alias/virtualhost dir is ALSO in /var/www
2008-03-14T06:13:00.000Z	scall	genii	I am trying so hard to understand that sentence but it went over my head.
2008-03-14T06:16:00.000Z	genii	scall	What did you put for DocumentRoot    when you made alterations to the 000-default or apache2.conf file?
2008-03-14T06:20:00.000Z	scall	genii	I searched for DocumentRoot in apache2.conf and found nothing.
2008-03-14T06:22:00.000Z	genii	scall	Perhaps take a look at the virtual host entry the person here made, it's the 7th greyish panel down the page, and compare it with whatever you put:  http://www.mjmwired.net/resources/mjm-apache-virtual-sites.html
2008-03-14T06:23:00.000Z	genii	scall	Adjust directories accordingly, of course
