2006-09-24T06:40:00.000Z	shmulik		Certain .m4a files are really not working.  Amarok can't add them to its collection and SoundConverter can't change them to Ogg Vorbis.  They aren't .m4p files and some of them work, but not all.
2006-09-24T06:41:00.000Z	crimsun	shmulik	GSt- or Xine-based player?
2006-09-24T06:41:00.000Z	shmulik	crimsun	Amarok was configured to use Xine... fwiw, I got m4a support from EasyUbuntu....
2006-09-24T06:42:00.000Z	crimsun	shmulik	via libxine-extracodecs?
2006-09-24T06:42:00.000Z	shmulik	crimsun	That package is installed, yes... version 1.1.1+ubuntu1-2
2006-09-24T06:43:00.000Z	crimsun	shmulik	^^ not only playable but audible
2006-09-24T06:44:00.000Z	shmulik	crimsun	That's the thing, they can play for the most part, but Amarok craps out when trying to add them to it's collection.
