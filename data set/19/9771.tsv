2007-12-04T18:31:00.000Z	vds		hi all
2007-12-04T18:32:00.000Z	vds		I'm playing with kvm/qemu installed on my ubuntu gutsy, I've been able to create a vm and make it run, the vm can access internet and can ping the physical machine, but I'm not able to reach the physical machine from the vm
2007-12-04T18:32:00.000Z	vds		any suggestion ?
2007-12-04T18:32:00.000Z	ikonia	vds	should your vm be able to access the host ?
2007-12-04T18:33:00.000Z	vds	ikonia	that's what I would like
2007-12-04T18:33:00.000Z	ikonia	vds	how are you trying to access the host?
2007-12-04T18:34:00.000Z	vds	ikonia	actually I don't know from where to start...
2007-12-04T18:34:00.000Z	ikonia	vds	if you don't know where to start how do you know you can't access it
2007-12-04T18:35:00.000Z	vds	ikonia	because they are on two different network
2007-12-04T18:35:00.000Z	ikonia	vds	so how are you trying to access it then
2007-12-04T18:37:00.000Z	vds	ikonia	the host is 192.168.1.110 the vm is 10.0.2.15 but can access the host using 10.0.2.2 I don't know how to access the vm I'm trying using 10.0.2.15 but of course it doesn't work...
2007-12-04T18:37:00.000Z	ikonia	vds	you need a route
2007-12-04T18:39:00.000Z	vds	ikonia	how do I create it ?
2007-12-04T18:39:00.000Z	ikonia	vds	route add
2007-12-04T18:40:00.000Z	vds	ikonia	yes, but what interface should I use ?
2007-12-04T18:40:00.000Z	ikonia	vds	the command line
2007-12-04T18:41:00.000Z	vds	ikonia	sorry I mean network interface
2007-12-04T18:41:00.000Z	ikonia	vds	which ever one you want to route from, to
2007-12-04T18:43:00.000Z	vds	ikonia	sorry I don't get it :(
