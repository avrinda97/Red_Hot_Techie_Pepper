2006-10-17T14:21:00.000Z	chuckyp	jewbilee	You want grub to not complain about it when its unplugged?
2006-10-17T14:24:00.000Z	chuckyp	jewbilee	yeah to try it and see what specific error you are getting then deal with it when it comes.
2006-10-22T07:17:00.000Z	chuckyp	jewbilee	what version are you trying to install?
2006-10-22T07:19:00.000Z	chuckyp	jewbilee	download that extract and put it in your /usr/lib/firefox/plugins
2006-10-22T07:20:00.000Z	chuckyp	jewbilee	restart firefox and flash will be working.
2006-10-22T07:22:00.000Z	chuckyp	jewbilee	ahh you want to install gnash.   I think they use cvs.

2006-10-22T07:23:00.000Z	chuckyp	jewbilee	well you have two choices basically gnash or adobes version of flash.
