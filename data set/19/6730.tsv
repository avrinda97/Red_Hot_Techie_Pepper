2008-05-31T20:00:00.000Z	Ben__	rodolfo_	use a console and type ps -ef|grep -v 00:00
2008-05-31T20:01:00.000Z	rodolfo_	Ben__	there is nothing under those columns
2008-05-31T20:01:00.000Z	Ben__	rodolfo_	ok, how long has yer machine been at 100%?
2008-05-31T20:01:00.000Z	rodolfo_	Ben__	app. 3min
2008-05-31T20:03:00.000Z	rodolfo_	Ben__	could you take a look @ http://paste.ubuntu.com/15998/ for me?
2008-05-31T20:07:00.000Z	Ben__	rodolfo_	- the only thing that seems to be using a lot of CPU is /usr/bin/X so unless im being really stupid (quite likely) then it would look like it's the X system that could be hammering it.
2008-05-31T20:07:00.000Z	Ben__	rodolfo_	are you running any apps on the machine?
2008-05-31T20:08:00.000Z	rodolfo_	Ben__	it makes sense since X has been a headache since these days I got Ubuntu hardy
2008-05-31T20:09:00.000Z	rodolfo_	Ben__	what do you want me to do?
2008-05-31T20:09:00.000Z	Ben__	rodolfo_	not sure really
2008-05-31T20:09:00.000Z	Ben__	rodolfo_	i've hardly used linux stuff with X - I'm a linux/unix server guy mostly
2008-05-31T20:10:00.000Z	Ben__	rodolfo_	and not a very good one at that lol
2008-05-31T20:10:00.000Z	Ben__	rodolfo_	what video card do you have?
2008-05-31T20:11:00.000Z	rodolfo_	Ben__	so I have a question, how can I make compiz-fusion NOT to be initialized after the system start up? I mean how can I make Ubuntu to use metacity as the default window manager instead of C-F?
2008-05-31T20:12:00.000Z	Ben__	rodolfo_	im sorry I have no idea
2008-05-31T20:12:00.000Z	Ben__	rodolfo_	im sure I have seen something in the ubuntu forums about metacity
2008-05-31T20:12:00.000Z	Ben__	rodolfo_	might be worth searching there
2008-05-31T20:13:00.000Z	rodolfo_	Ben__	I'm sure that it is. thanks
2008-05-31T20:14:00.000Z	Ben__	rodolfo_	yer welcome :)
