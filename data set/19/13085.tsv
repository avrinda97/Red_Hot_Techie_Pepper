2006-03-16T11:00:00.000Z	nalioth	Jivenix	no errors? no nothing?
2006-03-16T10:58:00.000Z	nalioth	Jivenix	did it tell you about any errors?
2006-03-16T10:59:00.000Z	nalioth	Jivenix	this channel needs more info to help you
2006-03-16T11:02:00.000Z	nalioth	Jivenix	can you try "sudo apt-get -f dist-upgrade" for us ?
2006-03-16T11:03:00.000Z	nalioth	Jivenix	i assume you had no problems before the upgrade?
2006-03-16T11:04:00.000Z	nalioth	Jivenix	and you upgraded to what?
2006-03-16T11:04:00.000Z	nalioth	Jivenix	AH, you need to be in #ubuntu+1
2006-03-16T11:04:00.000Z	nalioth	Jivenix	well, that is where the dapper questions are asked and answered
2006-03-16T11:05:00.000Z	nalioth	Jivenix	then i'd wait until tomorrow and upgrade again
2006-03-16T11:05:00.000Z	nalioth	Jivenix	use lynx
