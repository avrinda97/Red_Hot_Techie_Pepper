2007-10-23T10:03:00.000Z	jacquesmerde		 aldraughan: yeah, me too. but it still bothers me. i must be anal
2007-10-23T10:05:00.000Z	jacquesmerde		does the "screen and graphics" part of administration effect ONLY X???
2007-10-23T10:06:00.000Z	macogw	jacquesmerde	what *else* would it affect?
2007-10-23T10:06:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	macogw	i'm having bad display problems BEFORE X is even loaded..
2007-10-23T10:07:00.000Z	macogw	jacquesmerde	that's framebuffer.  it's broken in gutsy AFAIk
2007-10-23T10:07:00.000Z	macogw	jacquesmerde	it was broken as of a week and a half ago
2007-10-23T10:07:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	macogw	yeah, exactly. does it effect the framebuffer? i would presume all those settings are in grub to be passed to the kernel
2007-10-23T10:08:00.000Z	macogw	jacquesmerde	framebuffer is sent in grub. if you enable it there, it will disable your tty
2007-10-23T10:09:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	macogw	hold on, ubuntu doesn't seem to use a framebuffer by default. what are you talking about?
2007-10-23T10:25:00.000Z	macogw	jacquesmerde	you're right
2007-10-23T10:27:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	macogw	i AM right? wow, that's a first.
2007-10-23T10:28:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	macogw	so i take it compiz isn't supposed to have window borders and titlebars? that means i can only resize from right-clicking in the taskbar, and selecting resize, but i can only resize horizontally, not vertically
2007-10-23T10:30:00.000Z	macogw	jacquesmerde	yes it should have them. you were right that metacity+compiz=impossible.
2007-10-23T10:30:00.000Z	macogw	jacquesmerde	you should be able to use either emerald or gtk-window-decorator with compiz though
2007-10-23T10:30:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	macogw	what's the n00b way of settign that up?
2007-10-23T10:31:00.000Z	macogw	jacquesmerde	i suggest installing http://ubuntulinuxtipstricks.blogspot.com/2007/10/compiz-fusion-notification-area-icon.html so you have the nice little icon like beryl had that makes things easy
2007-10-23T10:33:00.000Z	macogw	jacquesmerde	i dont know. i dont use restricted drivers, so mine always "just work"
2007-10-23T10:33:00.000Z	macogw	jacquesmerde	i couldnt get compiz working right in kubuntu with nvidia on friday though
2007-10-23T10:34:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	macogw	i'm sticking with metacity. i honestly don't see the point of compiz
