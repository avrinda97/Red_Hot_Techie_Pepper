2006-01-02T08:06:00.000Z	sethk	pashaw	it's easy.  u for user, g for group, o for other, a for all.
2006-01-02T08:07:00.000Z	pashaw	sethk	  i see where it would be more obvious your talking stuff away

2006-01-05T15:44:00.000Z	pashaw	sethk	  no any clever ways of using smb over the net between his home and work
2006-01-05T15:45:00.000Z	sethk	pashaw	he was saying that he can't do it simply as with windows.  I'm pointing out that if he can do it simply with windows, he can do the same thing with samba
2006-01-05T15:45:00.000Z	pashaw	sethk	  yeah just wanted to be sure you knew what he was asking to do  :)

2006-01-05T15:49:00.000Z	sethk	pashaw	install the cygwin toolkit in windows.  gives you both an ssh client and server
2006-01-05T15:50:00.000Z	pashaw	sethk	  thx i know  but  thats not my preferred way   thx tho
2006-01-05T15:50:00.000Z	sethk	pashaw	that's ok, but the point is it is not only possible but quite easy
2006-01-05T15:50:00.000Z	pashaw	sethk	  perhaps you could help j2daosh  with this then
