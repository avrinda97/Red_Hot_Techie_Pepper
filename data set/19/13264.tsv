2005-04-24T10:05:00.000Z	FC		Can anyone help me with my resolution, there are 4 in my xorg.conf but in gnome only 1
2005-04-24T10:06:00.000Z	SeamusLP	FC	 Got anywhere you can post your xorg.conf?
2005-04-24T10:09:00.000Z	FC	SeamusLP	http://parabol.nl/xorg.txt
2005-04-24T10:10:00.000Z	SeamusLP	FC	 xorg.txt????
2005-04-24T10:11:00.000Z	FC	SeamusLP	I renamed it
2005-04-24T10:13:00.000Z	SeamusLP	FC	Hold on I'm looking at it.  What resolution are you running currently, and what resolution can you choose in gnome?
2005-04-24T10:16:00.000Z	SeamusLP	FC	 I don't see any problems so far.  What type of graphics are you using?
2005-04-24T10:17:00.000Z	SeamusLP	FC	 Like what type of manufacturer...
2005-04-24T10:24:00.000Z	SeamusLP	FC	 I'm thinking we need to have a look at the xorg log
2005-04-24T10:24:00.000Z	FC	SeamusLP	where can I find that?
2005-04-24T10:25:00.000Z	SeamusLP	FC	 it's in /var/log/Xorg.0.log
2005-04-24T10:25:00.000Z	SeamusLP	FC	 If there's some error on the server startup it'd be in there
2005-04-24T10:26:00.000Z	FC	SeamusLP	there are no errors
2005-04-24T10:27:00.000Z	SeamusLP	FC	There aren't any errors near the bottom of the log?
2005-04-24T10:27:00.000Z	FC	SeamusLP	ill check
2005-04-24T10:32:00.000Z	FC	SeamusLP	http://parabol.nl/Xorg.0.log
2005-04-24T10:33:00.000Z	SeamusLP	FC	Alright digging through that now...
2005-04-24T10:34:00.000Z	FC	SeamusLP	ill be back in half an hour or something, could you say everything in query please? thanks.
2005-04-24T10:34:00.000Z	SeamusLP	FC	Sure
