2005-05-04T12:48:00.000Z	Jet2k5	Seveas	lol just one last thing, I get a problem on lsb?
2005-05-04T12:48:00.000Z	Jet2k5	Seveas	it's a package that it's not updating, but when I force it , it doesn't install either
2005-05-04T12:49:00.000Z	Seveas	Jet2k5	are you using marillat?
2005-05-04T12:49:00.000Z	Jet2k5	Seveas	probably not, because I have no idea what that is
2005-05-04T12:50:00.000Z	Jet2k5	Seveas	no, it emerged way before I decided to add the extra repos
2005-05-04T12:50:00.000Z	Jet2k5	Seveas	hold on let me try the -f option again
2005-05-04T12:50:00.000Z	Jet2k5	Seveas	got it :)
2005-05-04T12:50:00.000Z	Jet2k5	Seveas	seems like I'm really really over looking stuff
2005-05-04T12:57:00.000Z	Seveas	Jet2k5	woody is the current debian stable
2005-05-04T12:57:00.000Z	Jet2k5	Seveas	ok after removing the backports I can't seem to download any other apps
2005-05-04T12:57:00.000Z	Seveas	Jet2k5	java is not available in ubuntu
2005-05-04T12:58:00.000Z	Seveas	Jet2k5	read the JavaHOWTO on ubuntulinux.org/wiki
2005-05-04T12:58:00.000Z	Jet2k5	Seveas	guess that would be the way to do it
2005-05-04T12:58:00.000Z	Seveas	Jet2k5	it is very easy to install java
