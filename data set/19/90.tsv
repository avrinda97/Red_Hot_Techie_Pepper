2012-09-25T00:26:00.000Z	mbeierl_	GlenUK	you can also type "/dev/sdb6" in the
2012-09-25T00:17:00.000Z	mbeierl_	GlenUK	pastebin the output of "mount", please
2012-09-25T00:18:00.000Z	mbeierl_	GlenUK	also check the output of 'dmesg' to see if there are any disk errors and the OS put the filesystem into read-only mode to prevent damage

2012-09-25T00:20:00.000Z	mbeierl_	GlenUK	I don't like that last line of the mount cmd output: mount: warning: /etc/mtab is not writeable (e.g. read-only file-system)  That typically means your / filesystem had an error and the whole thing has gone read-only
2012-09-25T00:21:00.000Z	mbeierl_	GlenUK	I should add: it means "/" went that way, as /etc/ and /tmp are all on the / filesystem according to the mount output you shared
2012-09-25T00:23:00.000Z	GlenUK	mbeierl_	i cannot get the full output of dmesg, can i pipe that to a text file?
2012-09-25T00:25:00.000Z	mbeierl_	GlenUK	you can try "dmesg | less" and then hit the space bar to go through page at a time
2012-09-25T00:27:00.000Z	mbeierl_	GlenUK	less command and it will search for dev/sdb6 one occurence at a time.  Hit / again to search for the next occurrence
2012-09-25T00:27:00.000Z	GlenUK	mbeierl_	let me grab a better irc client, getting bogged down with join/leave spam :)
2012-09-25T00:30:00.000Z	GlenUK	mbeierl_	ok i cannot install software atm :)
2012-09-25T00:30:00.000Z	GlenUK	mbeierl_	'dmesg | less /dev/sdb6' ?
2012-09-25T00:31:00.000Z	mbeierl_	GlenUK	you will not be able to install or modify the system at all until it is fixed
2012-09-25T00:31:00.000Z	mbeierl_	GlenUK	sorry, no.  'dmesg | less' then, when you get the first page, "/" starts entering a "search for" command
2012-09-25T00:32:00.000Z	mbeierl_	GlenUK	so you want to look for entries relating to dev/sdb6, so "/" followed by "dev/sdb6" and hit enter
2012-09-25T00:32:00.000Z	GlenUK	mbeierl_	not found
2012-09-25T00:33:00.000Z	mbeierl_	GlenUK	try "grep '/dev/sdb' /var/log/syslog" ?
2012-09-25T00:34:00.000Z	GlenUK	mbeierl_	http://paste.ubuntu.com/1225328/
2012-09-25T00:35:00.000Z	GlenUK	mbeierl_	ok :) thank you
