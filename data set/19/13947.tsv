2009-08-10T06:42:00.000Z	zefyx		it wants to remove linux headers
2009-08-10T06:42:00.000Z	zefyx		even though it didn't install them,.
2009-08-10T06:44:00.000Z	calamari_	zefyx	I'd suggest doing apt-get update && apt-get upgrade   and then try removing wine again

2009-08-10T06:45:00.000Z	zefyx		it didn't install all of that stuff.
2009-08-10T06:46:00.000Z	zefyx		calamari, i did that.
2009-08-10T06:46:00.000Z	zefyx		when i remove wine, ubuntu wants to remove   wine-gecko linux-headers-2.6.28-11 ttf-liberation linux-headers-2.6.28-11-generic winbind libaudio2
2009-08-10T06:46:00.000Z	zefyx		im assuming i need linux-headers
2009-08-10T06:46:00.000Z	zefyx		if not, then i'll proceed, but i know installing wine didn't install those linux headers.
2009-08-10T06:47:00.000Z	calamari_	zefyx	perhaps those are autoremovable
