2009-05-20T10:45:00.000Z	jyg_	losher	I tried, but grub isnt even in /boot.  So I booted off a usb drive I have which I did an full install and copied /boot/grub over to the internal drive's  root... still had issues.  bleh
2009-05-20T10:46:00.000Z	losher	jyg_	usually an install leaves a log file behind (I forget where). You might check that for clues...
2009-05-20T10:46:00.000Z	jyg_	losher	thanks
2009-05-20T10:46:00.000Z	jyg_	losher	in fedora is /root
2009-05-20T10:47:00.000Z	losher	jyg_	somewhere in /var/log ?
2009-05-20T10:48:00.000Z	jyg_	losher	looking in boyth places, seeinh nothing relevant
2009-05-20T10:49:00.000Z	jyg_	losher	there's some dropping that has some info in it , something aout perm denied for /root/.pangorc' ... something in Ubiquity
2009-05-20T10:51:00.000Z	losher	jyg_	not sure that's fatal. pango is optional I think. Might be better to redo the installation from scratch and watch it more closely?
2009-05-20T10:57:00.000Z	jyg_	losher	i went into the advanced table, just before committing to install, and realized it was set to put the bootloader on 'hd0' .. which i sould suppose translates to /dev/sda ... i hope it did not install to the top fo the device!  if it did, it wrecked my windows part... for not its set to /dev/sda2, my root
2009-05-20T11:01:00.000Z	losher	jyg_	there's a way to recover the windows booloader. Hopefully nothing else got trashed...
2009-05-20T11:01:00.000Z	jyg_	losher	i dont care about losing the windows boot loaders... i just hope that the beginning of the drive wasn't overwritten
2009-05-20T11:02:00.000Z	losher	jyg_	if it chkdisks ok, you should be fine. If not, you're screwed I think...
2009-05-20T11:02:00.000Z	jyg_	losher	well 55% now, reinstall... guess I'll find out soon enough... the unbuntu install shoudl really assume that the boot loader is install in the /boot partition and if there is not one then in (root)/boot
2009-05-20T11:03:00.000Z	losher	jyg_	Ubuntu is usually pretty good about detecting existing windows installs....
2009-05-20T11:09:00.000Z	jyg_	losher	2nd time things are cool, windows looks ok still.. thanks for the moral support :)
2009-05-20T11:09:00.000Z	losher	jyg_	great news!
2009-05-20T11:10:00.000Z	jyg_	losher	is there a prettier bootloader for ubuntu? :)
2009-05-20T11:12:00.000Z	losher	jyg_	Someone asked that eariler today. Apparently there's not really. There's some customisation you can do in grub, i.e. colors & splash, but otherwise no.
