2005-08-25T16:05:00.000Z	vot3		no, that does not sound right.
2005-08-25T16:06:00.000Z	vot3		what do you mean same group as the directory?
2005-08-25T16:07:00.000Z	vot3		and if that group is one that all users share then they will all have +rw to all files uploaded in those dirs?
2005-08-25T16:07:00.000Z	vot3		well i can read them
2005-08-25T16:07:00.000Z	vot3		but i cannot move the folders because a different user put them there
2005-08-25T16:08:00.000Z	vot3		if i put my user in her group i will have +rw to her files right?
2005-08-25T16:08:00.000Z	vot3		how do i set group permissions?
2005-08-25T16:10:00.000Z	vot3		i do not know what a cron sciprt is, but it sounds like overkill
2005-08-25T16:11:00.000Z	vot3		this seems like such a small easy thing, ubuntu is very configurable about everything else, i do not see why i would have to script for this
2005-08-25T16:13:00.000Z	vot3		i thought it was umask 000
2005-08-25T16:13:00.000Z	thoreauputic	vot3	either
2005-08-25T16:35:00.000Z	thoreauputic	vot3	this all seems rather tortuous - if you have read access to her dir you can scp the files to your own home dir and the permissions will say they belong to you
2005-08-25T16:44:00.000Z	thoreauputic	vot3	then as I said. all you need is read access - if you scp the files as yourself the ownership will change to your user, which means you can then write to them - have I missed something? Works here...
2005-08-25T16:46:00.000Z	vot3	thoreauputic	i have no reason to scp the files as my user, it is useless. i have nautilus
2005-08-25T16:46:00.000Z	thoreauputic	vot3	*cough* it's the same whether you do it in nautlus or CLI
2005-08-25T16:49:00.000Z	vot3	thoreauputic	i was testing it out for her, because she uses windows and i wanted to make sure it would work
2005-08-25T16:50:00.000Z	thoreauputic	vot3	ahh - OK my bad :)
2005-08-25T16:53:00.000Z	thoreauputic	vot3	re: GUI - you can drag and drop files over scp/sftp using nautilus - just type ssh://user@hostname
2005-08-25T16:53:00.000Z	vot3	thoreauputic	i am not the one making the connection though, she is. all i need is for the files she uploads to have the correct permissions so i do not have to chmod everytime she uploads something
