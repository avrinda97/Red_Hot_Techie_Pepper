2011-01-19T20:41:00.000Z	sgzfx		i'm having issues booting into ubuntu
2011-01-19T20:42:00.000Z	sgzfx		it leaves me at a command line interface
2011-01-19T20:42:00.000Z	sgzfx		:|
2011-01-19T20:42:00.000Z	sgzfx		alright, just a sec
2011-01-19T20:42:00.000Z	sgzfx		booting into ubuntu on the other computer i'm having the problem on
2011-01-19T20:43:00.000Z	sgzfx		Okay, as I boot into ubuntu it fails to mount things and says the target filesystem lacks a /sbin/init. Then it leads to BusyBox
2011-01-19T20:43:00.000Z	sgzfx		and does nothing from there on
2011-01-19T20:44:00.000Z	erUSUL	sgzfx	boot the machne with a livecd and check the filesystem
2011-01-19T20:44:00.000Z	sgzfx		I haven't made any significant changes to the ubuntu partition
2011-01-19T20:44:00.000Z	sgzfx		haven't even installed any packages since the last successful isntall
2011-01-19T20:44:00.000Z	sgzfx		install*
2011-01-19T20:45:00.000Z	sgzfx		so, have you guys ever had this problem before?
2011-01-19T20:45:00.000Z	sgzfx		don't have one right now
2011-01-19T20:45:00.000Z	sgzfx		this ubuntu install is ancient but it was working until just /one/ restart
2011-01-19T20:45:00.000Z	sgzfx		:(
2011-01-19T20:46:00.000Z	erUSUL	sgzfx	well looks like a filesystem corruption
2011-01-19T20:46:00.000Z	erUSUL	sgzfx	or a dying disk
2011-01-19T20:46:00.000Z	sgzfx	edbian	yes
2011-01-19T20:46:00.000Z	erUSUL	sgzfx	use a livecd to check if that's the case
