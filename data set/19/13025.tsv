2005-08-10T15:55:00.000Z	Xyc0	batma8_	If you have a seperate partition for just music, you might want to consider formating in fat32.  Both Linux and Windows can read/write to fat32
2005-08-10T15:56:00.000Z	Xyc0	batma8_	if it is the same partition as windows, dont bother
2005-08-10T15:59:00.000Z	Xyc0	batma8_	back up your music, when you format you erase everything on that partition
2005-08-10T16:05:00.000Z	Xyc0	batma8_	did you get everything working?
2005-08-10T16:06:00.000Z	Xyc0	batma8_	you need to add backports
2005-08-10T16:08:00.000Z	Xyc0	batma8_	no time is better then now
2005-08-10T16:10:00.000Z	Xyc0	batma8_	wiki.ubuntu.com, that site has alot of help to offer
2005-08-10T16:10:00.000Z	Xyc0	batma8_	search that site from now on to see if you can answer yourself
