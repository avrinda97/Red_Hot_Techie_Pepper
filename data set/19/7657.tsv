2007-08-13T09:05:00.000Z	Usrl		argh, tovid has dependancies I can't seem to find..
2007-08-13T09:06:00.000Z	bruenig	Usrl	tovid is week
2007-08-13T09:06:00.000Z	Usrl	bruenig	and I suppose you have something even better, then?
2007-08-13T09:06:00.000Z	bruenig	Usrl	devede
2007-08-13T09:06:00.000Z	Usrl	bruenig	yeah, I already tried that, and it didn't work.
2007-08-13T09:06:00.000Z	bruenig	Usrl	"didn't work" what do you mean by that
2007-08-13T09:08:00.000Z	bruenig	Usrl	what do you mean doesn't work
2007-08-13T09:08:00.000Z	Usrl	bruenig	doesn't burn to dvd or create an iso.
2007-08-13T09:08:00.000Z	bruenig	Usrl	it creates an iso
2007-08-13T09:08:00.000Z	Usrl	bruenig	No, it didn't, which is my point when I say it didn't work. Duh.
2007-08-13T09:09:00.000Z	bruenig	Usrl	no but what happens
2007-08-13T09:10:00.000Z	Usrl	bruenig	it makes am mpeg file, which puts me no better off than I already was.
2007-08-13T09:10:00.000Z	Usrl	bruenig	works for them, maybe. I'm looking for something that works for me, thanks.
2007-08-13T09:10:00.000Z	bruenig	Usrl	ok, you might be more suited for ##windows with that kind of mindset, stuff doesn't just "not work" for certain people, you probably have make compliant mpeg option checked instead of the iso option
2007-08-13T09:11:00.000Z	Usrl	bruenig	Actually, no, I use Linux, so windows wouldn't be much help. By nature of using linux, I'm actually intelligent enough to click the right button.
2007-08-13T09:12:00.000Z	bruenig	Usrl	you obviously aren't intelligent enough to realize that when something "doesn't work" that means you have something messed up, and doesn't mean well throw it away it is broken dur dur,
2007-08-13T09:12:00.000Z	Usrl	bruenig	Considering it doesn't do what it should, it's broken. If there's an error, it should report it.
2007-08-13T09:13:00.000Z	bruenig	Usrl	it is your fault it doesn't work
2007-08-13T09:14:00.000Z	bruenig	Usrl	oh nevermind Usrl I forgot I was in #ubuntu for a second, you probably should just try to find something else, computer confuse
