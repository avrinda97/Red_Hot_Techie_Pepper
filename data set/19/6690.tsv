2007-12-25T20:08:00.000Z	madxzen		can noone help me? heeeelp ;-)
2007-12-25T20:10:00.000Z	neko	madxzen	what is your problem ?
2007-12-25T20:10:00.000Z	madxzen	neko	i want to use a desktop-screen on my dell notebook with ATI graphics
2007-12-25T20:10:00.000Z	neko		okey you want to make dualscreen
2007-12-25T20:11:00.000Z	madxzen		yes exactly
2007-12-25T20:11:00.000Z	neko		i once have some test with my dell (but intel 945 chipset) it have nearly work
2007-12-25T20:12:00.000Z	neko		it doesn't work at all for you or it is just buggy ?
2007-12-25T20:12:00.000Z	madxzen		if i change it in settings, either screen works anymore after that
2007-12-25T20:12:00.000Z	madxzen		it goes all black
2007-12-25T20:13:00.000Z	madxzen		and restarting ubuntu doesn't solve the problem. i've reinstalled it like the 4th time
2007-12-25T20:13:00.000Z	neko		you have not any graphical output now ?
2007-12-25T20:13:00.000Z	madxzen		yes right now i have
2007-12-25T20:14:00.000Z	madxzen		but resolution is wrong
2007-12-25T20:14:00.000Z	madxzen		and in fact i only want to use the desktop screen instead of the notebook screen
2007-12-25T20:14:00.000Z	neko		it seems you will need to edit your xorg.conf file
2007-12-25T20:14:00.000Z	madxzen		manually?
2007-12-25T20:15:00.000Z	neko		if you want dualscreens waiting for some better solution. as far as i know, because i don't own an ati to tell you more
2007-12-25T20:15:00.000Z	madxzen	neko	alright. the problem is i'm completely new to ubuntu/linux, so i don't want to mess around too much with those files
2007-12-25T20:17:00.000Z	madxzen	neko	is there any manual out there how to reconfigure the xorg.conf?
