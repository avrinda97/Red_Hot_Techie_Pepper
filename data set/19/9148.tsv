2006-12-28T17:53:00.000Z	defiant		How many of you got a migraine when dealing with ubuntu for the first time
2006-12-28T11:01:00.000Z	defiant		Can anyone help me figure out why my remote desktop keeps crashing
2006-12-28T11:02:00.000Z	defiant		it just tells me
2006-12-28T11:02:00.000Z	defiant		that it crashed
2006-12-28T11:02:00.000Z	defiant		it happens when someone connects to me
2006-12-28T11:03:00.000Z	defiant		is there another way
2006-12-28T11:03:00.000Z	defiant		kinda like gnome did without the pass
2006-12-28T11:03:00.000Z	defiant		I am on Kubuntu with KDE
2006-12-28T11:04:00.000Z	defiant		There where different parts to that question. It did not warrant being on one line.
2006-12-28T11:05:00.000Z	un_operateur	defiant	it's just better to keep everything on one line so that people keep easy track of what you say.. even if they are multipart queries
2006-12-28T11:10:00.000Z	un_operateur	defiant	now you know why we say, keep your questions together
2006-12-28T11:26:00.000Z	un_operateur	defiant	it's a busy channel, you have to keep up with the paste, because no one is expected to remember what you said 2 minutes ago
2006-12-28T11:27:00.000Z	un_operateur	defiant	single line please
2006-12-28T11:28:00.000Z	un_operateur	defiant	well, suit yourself, if it gets busy, just dont expected to be treated like a king :)
2006-12-28T11:29:00.000Z	un_operateur	defiant	have you tried running remote desktop from the command line to see what errors it spits out to the console?
2006-12-28T11:30:00.000Z	un_operateur	defiant	you are talking about the remote desktop to windows, are you not?
2006-12-28T11:31:00.000Z	un_operateur	defiant	err, do you use this particular "remote desktop" to connect to windows machines?
2006-12-28T11:32:00.000Z	un_operateur	defiant	i think you need to open up more and explain the issue, because none of us here have crystal balls, comprende?
2006-12-28T11:35:00.000Z	un_operateur	defiant	whats the _exact_ command you are typing out?
