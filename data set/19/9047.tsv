2007-02-28T06:54:00.000Z	linuxnewbie756		how can i remove folder groups in alacarte? delete them i mean
2007-02-28T06:54:00.000Z	Amaranth	linuxnewbie756	select the parent folder on the left side
2007-02-28T06:55:00.000Z	Amaranth	linuxnewbie756	then you can delete (or hide, in older versions) the folders
2007-02-28T06:55:00.000Z	linuxnewbie756	Amaranth	i am supposed to be able to delete, but it isn't clickable. I can delete folders i have created, but how can i delete other ones?
2007-02-28T06:55:00.000Z	Amaranth	linuxnewbie756	you have an older version
2007-02-28T06:56:00.000Z	Amaranth	linuxnewbie756	you can only hide then
2007-02-28T06:56:00.000Z	linuxnewbie756	Amaranth	how would i update my version? Im using dapper, and I am waiting for feisty.
2007-02-28T06:57:00.000Z	Amaranth	linuxnewbie756	the newer versions are apart of the GNOME releases
2007-02-28T06:57:00.000Z	Amaranth	linuxnewbie756	No, GNOME is most of the software that runs your desktop :)
2007-02-28T06:57:00.000Z	Amaranth	linuxnewbie756	you need to upgrade to edgy or feisty
2007-02-28T06:58:00.000Z	linuxnewbie756	Amaranth	oh, when is feisty officially out?
2007-02-28T06:58:00.000Z	Amaranth	linuxnewbie756	april
2007-02-28T06:58:00.000Z	linuxnewbie756	Amaranth	will i be able to upgrade from dapper?
2007-02-28T06:58:00.000Z	Amaranth	linuxnewbie756	only if you upgrade to edgy first
2007-02-28T06:59:00.000Z	linuxnewbie756	Amaranth	that sounds hard, wouldn't it be just as easy to download fiesty and fresh install?
2007-02-28T06:59:00.000Z	Amaranth	linuxnewbie756	probably
2007-02-28T06:59:00.000Z	Amaranth	linuxnewbie756	easier, actually
2007-02-28T06:59:00.000Z	linuxnewbie756	Amaranth	thats what I will do then!!! Thanks.
2007-02-28T07:00:00.000Z	Amaranth	linuxnewbie756	well the upgrade it automated but it uses a lot of bandwidth and can cause problems, especially if you use 3rd party repos or automatix
