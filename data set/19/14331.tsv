2006-03-21T11:59:00.000Z	kip		andil thats what i used
2006-03-21T12:00:00.000Z	kip		beacuse it was in hibernate and it didnt want to be on
2006-03-21T12:00:00.000Z	kip		and this moring it beeped at the loading

2006-03-21T12:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kip	 installing Linux - should have no effect on your windows installl.
2006-03-21T12:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kip	 prove its linux's fault.. remove the linux hd. and see..
2006-03-21T12:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kip	 you dident reformat the drive with the swap file did ya?
2006-03-21T12:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kip	 sound s like windows is being stupid. :P
2006-03-21T12:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kip	 disable D: in the device manager or whatever its called.
2006-03-21T12:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kip	 thats an even better idea
2006-03-21T12:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kip	 if its allready installed - you dont need to reinstall.
2006-03-21T12:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kip	 i tend to use VNC for that task
2006-03-21T12:24:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kip	 use 'mount' to see if its mounte, and 'fdisk -l' to see what partitions are on it.. and perhaps mounti it manually if you need to
