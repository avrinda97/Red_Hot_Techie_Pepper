2008-06-16T21:33:00.000Z	olifre	capri	which awn-manager are you using, the one from normal hardy-repository?
2008-06-16T22:02:00.000Z	olifre	capri	Windows shut down correctly? Try chkdsk in windows.
2008-06-16T22:06:00.000Z	olifre	capri	I am not using KDE, no idea ^^.
2008-06-16T22:11:00.000Z	olifre	capri	what does df give you?
2008-06-16T22:11:00.000Z	olifre	capri	chkdsk n windows, df in KDE ^^.
2008-06-16T22:13:00.000Z	olifre	capri	it should list anything it tried to mount ^^.
2008-06-16T22:14:00.000Z	olifre	capri	Card, driver?
2008-06-16T22:15:00.000Z	olifre	capri	Ah, you can simply set it to roaming then.
2008-06-16T22:15:00.000Z	olifre	capri	Manual settngs, wlan, roaming.
2008-06-16T22:17:00.000Z	olifre	capri	try sudo iwlist scan in console and see if it finds any networks.
2008-06-16T22:20:00.000Z	olifre	capri	So there seems to be a problem with the driver or something.
2008-06-16T22:21:00.000Z	olifre	capri	yes, this one should also work in hardy.
2008-06-16T22:25:00.000Z	olifre	capri	Might try, but things look okay. Something seems to be blocking the card, however.
2008-06-16T22:26:00.000Z	olifre	capri	you can check with dmesg | grep kill
