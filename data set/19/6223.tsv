2008-03-03T22:42:00.000Z	AstorZZZ		well, i bought the card and monitors long time ago soo
2008-03-03T22:43:00.000Z	muchacho	AstorZZZ	is there a feature or description to look for to make sure the card can do dual display?  or does having 2 outputs = it will do it?
2008-03-03T22:43:00.000Z	muchacho	AstorZZZ	i saw some 1 dvi 1 vga cards pretty cheap at newegg but i want ot make sure it can do dual display
2008-03-03T22:43:00.000Z	AstorZZZ	muchacho	dunno, i think having two outputs is enough
2008-03-03T22:43:00.000Z	muchacho		how do you activate nfs file locking for openoffice?  using gutsy client/feisty server and oo v2.3
2008-03-03T22:44:00.000Z	muchacho	AstorZZZ	thanx
2008-03-03T22:44:00.000Z	AstorZZZ		unless both outputs are connected to one, (just to get vga and dvi on one card)
2008-03-03T22:44:00.000Z	muchacho	AstorZZZ	ok thats what i am afraid of
2008-03-03T22:44:00.000Z	muchacho	AstorZZZ	surely there must be a feature or desc one can look for
