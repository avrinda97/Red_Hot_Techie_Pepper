2006-07-02T10:03:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	lufis	 things you need to play copyrighted formats
2006-07-02T10:03:00.000Z	lufis	Jack_Sparrow	In the kernel?
2006-07-02T10:04:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	lufis	read up there then ask questions
2006-07-02T10:04:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	lufis	one and the same
2006-07-02T10:05:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	lufis	 better questions make for better answers
2006-07-02T10:05:00.000Z	lufis	Jack_Sparrow	How fucking clear could I possibly get?
2006-08-08T09:45:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	lufis	Only while turning the knob..?  Dirty volume/potentiometer
2006-08-08T09:46:00.000Z	lufis	Jack_Sparrow	Hm... well I Google'd and got pretty much the same answer, but I've cleaned it out with compressed air and it's still doing it
2006-08-08T09:47:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	lufis	Air will seldom get inside the case of the pot.  Tapping and turning sometmes cleans it.. for awhile
2006-08-08T09:47:00.000Z	lufis	Jack_Sparrow	Gr... it's annoying
2006-08-08T09:47:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	lufis	USe the software volume control
2006-08-08T09:48:00.000Z	lufis	Jack_Sparrow	I guess I'll have to. :P That or get some new speakers... I've been wanting some better ones anyway
