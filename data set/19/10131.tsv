2010-01-24T22:30:00.000Z	crystalblue		when i try to connect to photobucket.com it shuts down my internet connection on karmic?
2010-01-24T22:31:00.000Z	crystalblue		ah ok
2010-01-24T22:31:00.000Z	crystalblue		thanks
2010-01-24T22:31:00.000Z	crystalblue		will do
2010-01-24T22:32:00.000Z	crystalblue		i'll try again in a couple days then.
2010-01-24T22:32:00.000Z	crystalblue		it works on my mac, just not on my linux machine
2010-01-24T22:32:00.000Z	sebsebseb	crystalblue	well that's a bit odd in a way
2010-01-24T22:30:00.000Z	sebsebseb	crystalblue	not sure about that, but  if I remember correctly it's photobucket that don't support Linux properly anymore
2010-01-24T22:31:00.000Z	sebsebseb	crystalblue	well flickr and what not as alternatives
2010-01-24T22:31:00.000Z	sebsebseb	crystalblue	also maybe it's just at the moment you can't get on photobucket, but later on you can
2010-01-24T22:32:00.000Z	sebsebseb	crystalblue	it should work on Linux as well, but photobucket might have done something so  Linux users can't just go on it anymore
2010-01-24T22:34:00.000Z	sebsebseb	crystalblue	so that you can't go on webistes at all?
2010-01-24T22:34:00.000Z	sebsebseb	crystalblue	that's odd
2010-01-24T22:35:00.000Z	sebsebseb	crystalblue	here's an idea little test, still got the Ubuntu Live CD?
2010-01-24T22:36:00.000Z	sebsebseb	crystalblue	ok so boot up the LIve CD, and go on photobucket and find out, if  you get the problem or not with that as well
2010-01-24T22:36:00.000Z	sebsebseb	crystalblue	if not,  maybe something has gone bad with your actsaul install,  which might of happended, but not that likely
2010-01-24T22:37:00.000Z	sebsebseb	crystalblue	ok
2010-01-24T22:38:00.000Z	sebsebseb	crystalblue	oh wireless
2010-01-24T22:38:00.000Z	sebsebseb	crystalblue	you can set up wireless on the Live CD
