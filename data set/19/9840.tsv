2008-03-31T12:54:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	LDS_Trooper	uh, what is it?
2008-03-31T12:54:00.000Z	LDS_Trooper	tonyyarusso	its a game
2008-03-31T12:54:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	LDS_Trooper	what game?
2008-03-31T12:54:00.000Z	LDS_Trooper	tonyyarusso	armagetron
2008-03-31T12:55:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	LDS_Trooper	You don't.  You 'sudo apt-get install armagetron'
2008-03-31T12:55:00.000Z	LDS_Trooper	tonyyarusso	this is on a remote server not my home machine
2008-03-31T12:55:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	LDS_Trooper	So?
2008-03-31T12:56:00.000Z	LDS_Trooper	tonyyarusso	will that give me the dedicated server edition?
2008-03-31T12:56:00.000Z	LDS_Trooper	tonyyarusso	we do have shell access through PuTTY
2008-03-31T12:56:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	LDS_Trooper	armagetrond-dedicated then
2008-03-31T12:57:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	LDS_Trooper	either way, you should be installing from the repos, not random files you find online that aren't even for your distro.
2008-03-31T12:58:00.000Z	LDS_Trooper	tonyyarusso	one sec
2008-03-31T13:00:00.000Z	LDS_Trooper	tonyyarusso	the .package is from the arma site and its what they offer for linux.. one sec while we try the spt-get option
2008-03-31T13:01:00.000Z	LDS_Trooper	tonyyarusso	the sudo apt-get install armagetron-dedicated says "couldn't find package armagetron-dedicated"
2008-03-31T13:01:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	LDS_Trooper	that's because you mistyped it.  There's a d in there.
2008-03-31T13:02:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	LDS_Trooper	apt-cache search armegatron
2008-03-31T13:06:00.000Z	LDS_Trooper	tonyyarusso	just running the commands now.. one sec..
2008-03-31T13:06:00.000Z	LDS_Trooper	tonyyarusso	thanks by the way
