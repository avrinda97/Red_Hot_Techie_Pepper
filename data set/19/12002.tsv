2005-11-04T07:30:00.000Z	necator		seveas lets not start a windows vs linux flame war. I actually got nothing against windows.
2005-11-04T07:31:00.000Z	necator		can someone tell me what the programs etherape and etherreal are for?
2005-11-04T07:32:00.000Z	dooglus	necator	etherape shows you a diagram of which hosts are sending stuff to each other.  ethereal shows it in a table.
2005-11-04T07:32:00.000Z	dooglus	necator	they monitor ethernet traffic, yeah.
2005-11-04T07:40:00.000Z	necator	dooglus	https://wiki.ubuntu.com//
2005-11-18T06:39:00.000Z	dooglus	necator	all over the place, wherever they belong.
2005-11-18T06:39:00.000Z	dooglus	necator	you can "dpkg -L <packagename>" to see what it installed for any given package
2005-11-18T08:36:00.000Z	dooglus	necator	he's forgotten his user's password - or someone's changed it for him
2005-11-18T08:36:00.000Z	necator	dooglus	he thinks he needs another password called root.
2005-11-18T08:36:00.000Z	necator	dooglus	we are telling him his usr accoutn is the root password.
2005-11-18T08:36:00.000Z	dooglus	necator	I don't think he does.
2005-11-18T08:37:00.000Z	necator	dooglus	if he does sudo he will be fine
2005-11-18T08:37:00.000Z	necator	dooglus	but hes rude no point helping him.
2005-11-18T08:38:00.000Z	dooglus	necator	I think he's being rude 'cos he's frustrated that everyone is answering a question that he didn't ask :)
2005-11-18T08:38:00.000Z	necator	dooglus	i think someone did tell him that solution first and he said it was wrong so we told him another one.
2005-11-18T08:38:00.000Z	dooglus	necator	boot into rescue mode and reset your password from there if it really has changed.
2005-11-18T08:39:00.000Z	dooglus	necator	try typing it at the command prompt to see if it looks right
2005-11-18T08:40:00.000Z	necator	dooglus	im not the one with the password problem he is.
2005-11-18T08:40:00.000Z	dooglus	necator	you all look the same to me, you IRC nicks
