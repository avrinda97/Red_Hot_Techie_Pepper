2007-07-11T16:33:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Dr_Link	You cant just put the iso onto the flash drive and get it to work.
2007-07-11T16:34:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Dr_Link	I have it working here.. but it is a 4 gig flash
2007-07-11T16:35:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Dr_Link	You can go persistent, and just have home on the flash and boot from the cd
2007-07-11T16:36:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Dr_Link	Are you tring to install from the flash or run live from the flash to recover windows data
2007-07-11T16:39:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Dr_Link	You need to define something for me..  Having an installer implies you are going to install ubuntu on the hard drive of the problem computer..
2007-07-11T16:40:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Dr_Link	HAving a working install is different

2007-07-11T16:44:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Dr_Link	You install the live version on a usb
2007-07-11T16:45:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Dr_Link	Have you run the live version of ubuntu before?
