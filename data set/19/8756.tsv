2007-06-23T10:19:00.000Z	megafauna		HI. Can someone recommend a decent file backup utility that can copy directories which only replaces the files which have been altered and leaves the unaltered ones? I had one in windoze but not now
2007-06-23T10:19:00.000Z	madman91	megafauna	you can try rsync
2007-06-23T10:19:00.000Z	madman91	megafauna	its in command line
2007-06-23T10:19:00.000Z	madman91	megafauna	it basically mirrors the dest. to any changes in source
2007-06-23T10:20:00.000Z	megafauna	madman91	thanks! I am looking it up now
2007-06-23T10:20:00.000Z	madman91	megafauna	the manual is a little bit deep
2007-06-23T10:21:00.000Z	madman91	megafauna	you can try Konserve or rsync.. but if you choose rsync, just use rsync -av SOURCE DEST
2007-06-23T10:21:00.000Z	madman91	megafauna	easy stuff
2007-06-23T10:21:00.000Z	megafauna	madman91	the manual is deeeeep!
2007-06-23T10:22:00.000Z	megafauna	madman91	I'm trying your command line
2007-06-23T10:22:00.000Z	madman91	megafauna	thats because rsync isnt only used in this simple sense
2007-06-23T10:22:00.000Z	madman91	megafauna	its also throughout the internet and stuff
2007-06-23T10:22:00.000Z	madman91	megafauna	you can use rsync with ftp, http, across lan, across ssh, etc..
2007-06-23T10:23:00.000Z	megafauna	madman91	no this is just my home files backup to an external drive. nice and easy:)
2007-06-23T10:24:00.000Z	madman91	megafauna	yeah.. i do that all the time
2007-06-23T10:24:00.000Z	madman91	megafauna	rsync -av SOURce DESTination
2007-06-23T10:27:00.000Z	megafauna	madman91	by st. george's dragon it works! now to backup the BIG directory. Thanks again!
