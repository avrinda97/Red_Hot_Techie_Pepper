2009-04-29T05:29:00.000Z	sebsebseb	neskat	the Windows registery is a load of junk
2009-04-29T05:29:00.000Z	sebsebseb	neskat	got to be a Windows geek to know how to use the Windows registery properly
2009-04-29T05:29:00.000Z	neskat	sebsebseb	I think it's a way better design that what Linux does
2009-04-29T05:29:00.000Z	sebsebseb	neskat	just like got to be a Windows geek to know what the blue screen of death error codes actsaully mean
2009-04-29T05:30:00.000Z	neskat	sebsebseb	I spent years being a 'windows geek' for work
2009-04-29T05:30:00.000Z	sebsebseb	neskat	and Windows is the one that is meant to be all user friendly, ha ha
2009-04-29T05:30:00.000Z	neskat	sebsebseb	at least it forces you into a standard making rolling out apps accross multiple server easy
2009-04-29T05:31:00.000Z	sebsebseb	neskat	Windows server,  uh pretty pointless, since Unix and Linux servers :)
2009-04-29T05:31:00.000Z	sebsebseb	neskat	plus the whole freedom stuff :)  with opensource and freesoftware
2009-04-29T05:31:00.000Z	neskat	sebsebseb	I agree, but half the world still runs them for enterpirse apps
2009-04-29T05:31:00.000Z	sebsebseb	neskat	yeah well that's, because most computer users are ignorant, hence why Windows gained most of the market,  anyway off topic
2009-04-29T05:32:00.000Z	neskat	sebsebseb	ignorance has nothing to do with corporate windows server usage, please go work  in the real world then try and scholl me
2009-04-29T05:32:00.000Z	sebsebseb	neskat	propritary software  locks people in, end of story
2009-04-29T05:33:00.000Z	neskat	sebsebseb	 I agree, I never contested that point, that was totally random
2009-04-29T05:33:00.000Z	sebsebseb	neskat	Unix used to lock people in to, hence why Richard Stallman started the GNU project,  and  yeah along come Linux distros later.  I assume you know this story
2009-04-29T05:33:00.000Z	sebsebseb	neskat	Windows server is laughed at by many in the Linux community :d
2009-04-29T05:33:00.000Z	neskat	sebsebseb	I don't need a histroy lesson, please stop spoting random facts in an attempt to look clever
2009-04-29T05:34:00.000Z	sebsebseb	neskat	and companies like to standardize, and so naturalely they are going to usually go for the one that has most marekt share, for the computer task they want to do
