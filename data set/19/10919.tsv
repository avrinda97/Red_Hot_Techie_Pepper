2006-06-11T07:18:00.000Z	bootlick		Using asureus, on drapper, i get a warning saying that if i have a firewall please check to see if port 46761 UDP is open, this is a fresh install of drapper and I have installed no firewall, is there a firewall or such on by default?
2006-06-11T07:20:00.000Z	bootlick		Will - I am plugged right into the cable modem, no router
2006-06-11T07:20:00.000Z	slackern	bootlick	Dapper does not have a firewall enabled by default.
2006-06-11T07:21:00.000Z	slackern	bootlick	the command 'sudo iptables -L' in a shell will show you if you have some firewallrules enabled.
2006-06-11T07:25:00.000Z	slackern	bootlick	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/15522 this is how my output looks, thats without any rules.
2006-06-11T07:29:00.000Z	slackern	bootlick	you had a router you said? which brand and modell?
2006-06-11T07:29:00.000Z	slackern	bootlick	oh adsl modem?
2006-06-11T07:30:00.000Z	slackern	bootlick	Just wondering since some adslmodems are routers also with firewalls
2006-06-11T07:31:00.000Z	slackern	bootlick	i think it's installed as default.
2006-06-11T07:32:00.000Z	slackern	bootlick	'which update-alternatives' will show you where the binary is located.
2006-06-11T07:33:00.000Z	slackern	bootlick	oh, then it could be something with azuerus/java messing around with you probably.
2006-06-11T07:34:00.000Z	slackern	bootlick	aye there you got it, you need to use 'sudo update-alternatives' for it since it needs to be run using superuser priviligies
2006-06-11T07:35:00.000Z	slackern	bootlick	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Java and read the section "Selecting the default Java version"
2006-06-11T07:37:00.000Z	slackern	bootlick	hmm https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Java doesn't work?
2006-06-11T07:38:00.000Z	slackern	bootlick	hmm must be something messy then, works fine here.
2006-06-11T07:39:00.000Z	slackern	bootlick	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/15523 works?
2006-06-11T07:39:00.000Z	slackern	bootlick	i copied the section for you and put it there.
2006-06-11T07:43:00.000Z	slackern	bootlick	your welcome.
2006-06-11T07:43:00.000Z	slackern	bootlick	they are probably not installed then, not sure if you need them though.
