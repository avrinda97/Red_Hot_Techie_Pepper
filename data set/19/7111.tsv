2007-10-07T14:41:00.000Z	ikonia	jbish	just ask the question in public
2007-10-07T14:42:00.000Z	ikonia	jbish	do you have general network connectivity over wirless network ?
2007-10-07T14:43:00.000Z	jbish	ikonia	yes it do
2007-10-07T14:43:00.000Z	ikonia	jbish	ok, so which applications are not working over wirless
2007-10-07T14:44:00.000Z	ikonia	jbish	what do you mean, you actually can't open a terminal window, or you can't connect to anything from within a terminal
2007-10-07T14:45:00.000Z	jbish	ikonia	when i click on any icon in the gui nothing runs , even when i do alt f2 and run the command, nothing happens
2007-10-07T14:45:00.000Z	ikonia	jbish	ok, when you disable the wirless network card, does it work ?
2007-10-07T14:46:00.000Z	jbish	ikonia	yes everyint work find when it's not connected
2007-10-07T14:46:00.000Z	ikonia	jbish	thats bizare, I can only suggest that something like pam is trying to do a network auth before opening any apps, 1.) check your resolv.conf file for your dns servers and make sure its reachable by the ip address your machine has got when on the wirless network
2007-10-07T14:47:00.000Z	ikonia	jbish	boot into non-graphical mode to check
2007-10-07T14:52:00.000Z	ikonia	jbish	you've been asked about caps now, 3 times
2007-10-07T14:53:00.000Z	ikonia	jbish	its nothing to do with drivers
2007-10-07T14:53:00.000Z	ikonia	jbish	askt the question
2007-10-07T14:55:00.000Z	ikonia	jbish	you've not asked a question apart from saying "ubuntu tablet PC"
