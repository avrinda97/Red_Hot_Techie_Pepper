2006-04-28T15:16:00.000Z	mart	vladuz976	I guess you need scim and scim-tables-ja
2006-04-28T15:22:00.000Z	mart	vladuz976	not as far as I know :(
2006-04-28T15:22:00.000Z	vladuz976	mart	are you using japanese on ubuntu?
2006-04-28T15:23:00.000Z	mart	vladuz976	no, but I've messed around with scim before when debugging that sort of thing.
2006-04-28T15:24:00.000Z	mart	vladuz976	are you still having problems?  did you install those packages I mentioned?
2006-04-28T15:25:00.000Z	vladuz976	mart	i am updating righ now. i`ll try once i get this done
2006-04-28T15:26:00.000Z	vladuz976	mart	my girlfriend had issues with windows so i installed ubuntu on her laptop, i just hope that the input method works out fine, coz she doesn`t do much except for browsing and emailing, so i am sure she`ll like it
2006-04-28T15:27:00.000Z	mart	vladuz976	well, to be honest, I've only ever used cjk support in kubuntu - I'm not sure how different it is under gnome.
2006-04-28T15:27:00.000Z	vladuz976	mart	what is cjk?
2006-04-28T15:28:00.000Z	mart	vladuz976	chinese, japanese and korean input.
2006-04-28T15:28:00.000Z	vladuz976	mart	oh ok
2006-04-28T15:28:00.000Z	vladuz976	mart	should be the same in ubuntu then
2006-04-28T15:37:00.000Z	vladuz976	mart	you know the difference between scim anthy prime and canna?
2006-04-28T15:38:00.000Z	mart	vladuz976	only what "apt-cache show scim-anthy scim-prime scim-canna" tells me
2006-04-28T15:42:00.000Z	mart	vladuz976	can't see anything... :(
2006-04-28T15:43:00.000Z	mart	vladuz976	Package: language-support-ja
2006-04-28T15:43:00.000Z	mart	vladuz976	perhaps that's it?
2006-04-28T15:43:00.000Z	vladuz976	mart	i think that`s it, i am trying, thanks
