2007-07-21T07:45:00.000Z	arcade	SoulPropagation	hmm.
2007-07-21T07:45:00.000Z	arcade	SoulPropagation	Do you have a dhcp server on that network?
2007-07-21T07:45:00.000Z	SoulPropagation	arcade	yes, my router.
2007-07-21T07:45:00.000Z	arcade	SoulPropagation	Well, is that on the TAP-network?
2007-07-21T07:46:00.000Z	arcade	SoulPropagation	I mean, you use TUN/TAP, or whatever, and that talks to your ubuntu-box ..
2007-07-21T07:46:00.000Z	arcade	SoulPropagation	.. and no dhcp-server? :P
2007-07-21T07:47:00.000Z	SoulPropagation	arcade	Static IP's on Ubuntu and Qemu
2007-07-21T07:48:00.000Z	SoulPropagation	arcade	as a general rule I'll use static IPs whenever I can.
2007-07-21T07:48:00.000Z	arcade	SoulPropagation	I'm not sure how VM's and so forth works, but I would expect your machine to talk to itself through some virtual interface shared between the machines, and the one of the hosts doing the routing, and providing dhcp to the other machines.  I may, however, be completely wrong in how it works.
2007-07-21T07:48:00.000Z	arcade	SoulPropagation	Or static IP's, as long as the 'host OS' provides the routing.
2007-07-21T07:48:00.000Z	SoulPropagation	arcade	I followed the instructions on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsXPUnderQemuHowTo :p
2007-07-21T07:49:00.000Z	arcade	SoulPropagation	I know how it works with SOlaris and zones, and there you have virtual interfaces that is inherited by the guest-solarises.  No clue in your environment though.
2007-07-21T07:50:00.000Z	arcade	SoulPropagation	heh.  Look at the 'cons' for the TAP network
2007-07-21T07:51:00.000Z	SoulPropagation	arcade	*blank stare*(
