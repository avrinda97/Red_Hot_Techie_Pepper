2007-06-13T09:22:00.000Z	carajea1		Is there a reason why ubuntu is so unstable and unpredictable?
2007-06-13T09:22:00.000Z	preaction	carajea1	can you be more specific and less troll-worthy?
2007-06-13T09:24:00.000Z	preaction	carajea1	these things do not just magically happen, no matter how used to window's behavior you are. do you have automatic updates turned on?
2007-06-13T09:24:00.000Z	preaction	carajea1	then what changed?
2007-06-13T09:25:00.000Z	preaction	carajea1	again, these things do not magically happen. does anyone else use the computer? what have you done recently?
2007-06-13T09:27:00.000Z	preaction	carajea1	"kinda on-going"?
2007-06-13T09:30:00.000Z	preaction	carajea1	ubuntu fiesty? sounds like you're using OSS and not ALSA
2007-06-13T09:31:00.000Z	preaction	carajea1	what sound card? it's possible the sound card is blocking, if it's ancient or cheap
2007-06-13T09:36:00.000Z	preaction	carajea1	but you told me nothing changed?
2007-06-13T09:39:00.000Z	preaction	carajea1	lesson for today, in the computer (logical) world, answering "no" means "no". not "no, except for this, this, and this."
2007-06-13T09:39:00.000Z	preaction	carajea1	not easily, no. what changed?
2007-06-13T09:41:00.000Z	preaction	carajea1	also, unless you see an update you need, you don't have to update really.
2007-06-13T09:41:00.000Z	preaction	carajea1	was a kernel update included? did it ask you to restart?
2007-06-13T09:42:00.000Z	preaction	carajea1	okay, so we're getting closer now: what kind of sound card do you have? PCI or onboard?
2007-06-13T09:43:00.000Z	preaction	carajea1	does it show up in "lspci"? (open a terminal, type "lspci" look for "creative sound blaster" or otherwise)
2007-06-13T09:45:00.000Z	preaction	carajea1	that'd be the one
2007-06-13T09:50:00.000Z	preaction	carajea1	what does "uname -a" say?
2007-06-13T09:52:00.000Z	preaction	carajea1	little3lue: did you start here? https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DebuggingSoundProblems
2007-06-13T09:56:00.000Z	preaction	carajea1	no, they don't use sudo. init is setuid root, and init runs those things
