2012-06-05T11:08:00.000Z	nydel	maverick	all your files are owned by nobody?
2012-06-05T11:10:00.000Z	nydel	maverick	what happens?
2012-06-05T11:10:00.000Z	nydel	maverick	when you do "sudo chown (your user name) file"
2012-06-05T11:12:00.000Z	nydel	maverick	this is good, yes?
2012-06-05T11:13:00.000Z	nydel	maverick	is it one folder's contents?
2012-06-05T11:15:00.000Z	nydel	maverick	sudo chown [username] ~/Downloads/*
2012-06-05T11:15:00.000Z	nydel	maverick	happy to
2012-06-05T11:19:00.000Z	maverick	nydel	this helped my sudo chown [username] Downloads/*/*
2012-06-05T11:20:00.000Z	nydel	maverick	sudo chown -R [username] ~/Downloads
2012-06-05T11:20:00.000Z	nydel	maverick	the -R is recursive, it changes every directory & file.
2012-06-05T11:20:00.000Z	nydel	maverick	but yours worked too so, nicely done ;)
2012-06-05T11:21:00.000Z	nydel	maverick	if i didn't guess 90% of the time i'd get less than 10% of my work done ;)
