2004-12-10T10:02:00.000Z	Hikaru79		Are there any easy-to-use graphical FTP server softwares to save me all the headache that is vsftpd? =/ You know, like Windows' G6 Bulletproof FTP server
2004-12-10T10:03:00.000Z	Hikaru79		I need a SERVER
2004-12-10T10:04:00.000Z	Hikaru79		Just a graphical configuration utility
2004-12-10T10:04:00.000Z	Hikaru79		Because I've been ripping my hair out for the last week trying to make vsftpd work properly
2004-12-10T10:04:00.000Z	Hikaru79		So far, I've got it locally accepting anonymous connections
2004-12-10T10:04:00.000Z	Hikaru79		Forget global connections :P
2004-12-10T10:04:00.000Z	Hikaru79		Simply won't work
2004-12-10T10:06:00.000Z	Hikaru79		proftpd, eh? You got it going the way you like?
2004-12-10T10:07:00.000Z	kurtw	Hikaru79	Do you have a firewall running?
2004-12-10T10:07:00.000Z	Hikaru79	kurtw	not a firewall. I do have a router, but I forwarded all the correct ports
2004-12-10T10:08:00.000Z	kurtw	Hikaru79	Run an nmap from an external source to verify that the ports are open and working
2004-12-10T10:08:00.000Z	kurtw	Hikaru79	yes.  Msg me is you need a hand doing a scan from remote.
2004-12-10T10:12:00.000Z	kurtw	Hikaru79	Either your ISP is blocking traffic our your router is not configured correctly.  I was not able to return any ports being open.  I just scanned from three different major ISP's with the same results.
2004-12-10T10:13:00.000Z	kurtw	Hikaru79	Scratch that, I just got the port list.
2004-12-10T10:14:00.000Z	kurtw	Hikaru79	connection is refused but the port is open.
2004-12-10T10:14:00.000Z	kurtw	Hikaru79	Is vsftp set to listen on your LAN interface?
2004-12-10T10:17:00.000Z	Hikaru79	kurtw	What do you mean? I can connect to the ftp from within the lan, but from anywhere else, it's 'connection refused'
2004-12-10T10:18:00.000Z	kurtw	Hikaru79	check the port forwarding on the router.
2004-12-10T11:01:00.000Z	Hikaru79	kurtw	it comes with inetd
