2008-08-10T19:33:00.000Z	bastid_raZor		possibly a reason why on a fresh install 2nd round of updates are held back.. most i'm curious as to why 2.6.24-19-generic is being held back
2008-08-10T19:34:00.000Z	histo	bastid_raZor	because you aren't doing a dist upgrade.
2009-10-20T09:17:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	histo	can you install pastebinit from where you are?

2010-05-08T03:50:00.000Z	histo	bastid_raZor	yeah it should be three times as fast appears to be a driver issue
2010-05-08T03:51:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	histo	9.10 actually copied up to 2.5MB/s .. only wifi has slow speeds.. ethernet cable is full 10MB/s speeds
