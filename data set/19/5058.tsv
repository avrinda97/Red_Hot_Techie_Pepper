2011-11-06T17:59:00.000Z	christian__		  * discard 9/udp - failed! and os on...
2011-11-06T17:59:00.000Z	christian__		i really dont know why he cant start them... any tipps ? please
2011-11-06T17:59:00.000Z	christian__		Couldn't create TCP socket: Cannot assign requested address at /usr/local/lib/perl/5.10.1/Net/DNS/Nameserver.pm line 90
2011-11-06T17:59:00.000Z	christian__		its a perl program
2011-11-06T18:00:00.000Z	christian__		why cant perl create a tcp socket nor asign an address to it ? i am not familiar with perl
2011-11-06T18:00:00.000Z	bekks	christian__	Because the address/port is already in use, most likely.
2011-11-06T18:01:00.000Z	christian__	bekks	inetsm is a honeypot, it creates all the fake services (e.g. port < 1024)
2011-11-06T18:01:00.000Z	bekks	christian__	You said that before. That does not change a word about what I said.
2011-11-06T18:01:00.000Z	christian__		of course these ports are already in use, but inetsim uses an other ip adress to bind the services to
2011-11-06T18:01:00.000Z	christian__		no bekks you unerstood me wrong
2011-11-06T18:02:00.000Z	christian__		inetsim uses 192.102.1.205 to bind the serivces too, there shouldn be any ports listeing
2011-11-06T18:02:00.000Z	christian__		*shouldn't
2011-11-06T18:04:00.000Z	christian__		it doenst matter what ip adress i use to bind the services too it always fails to create the sockets
2011-11-06T18:05:00.000Z	christian__		nobody here knows inetsim ?
2011-11-06T18:06:00.000Z	bekks	christian__	Check wether that address/port is already used.
