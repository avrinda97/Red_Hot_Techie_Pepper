2010-08-19T23:35:00.000Z	Magnetro		Nah, you just can run through wine..
2010-08-19T23:36:00.000Z	Magnetro		I'm actually a newborn to linux but I found out how much better it is than windows.
2010-08-19T23:37:00.000Z	Magnetro		My unbuntu is like 8. something.
2010-08-19T23:37:00.000Z	Magnetro		I got this off cragslist for 125 >_>
2010-08-19T23:37:00.000Z	Magnetro		craigs*'

2010-08-19T23:38:00.000Z	Magnetro		Yeah i'm quite sure my unbuntu is old.
2010-08-19T23:38:00.000Z	Magnetro		as heck, if I can't curse in here.
2010-08-19T23:38:00.000Z	Magnetro		my unbuntu is old, smh.
2010-08-19T23:40:00.000Z	Magnetro		If I get an update from this 8. w/e to a more recent model when Iose all my current programs and such?
2010-08-19T23:40:00.000Z	syn-ack	Magnetro	Depends on how you upgrade
2010-08-19T23:41:00.000Z	syn-ack	Magnetro	if you do a fresh install you'll lose anything you've not backed up; if you do an inline upgrade, you may lose a couple deprecated app, but that's about it
2010-08-19T23:42:00.000Z	syn-ack	Magnetro	Before any upgrade though, it is highly advised that you back up
2010-08-19T23:43:00.000Z	syn-ack	Magnetro	that's what you do when you upgrade from the repos instead of installing from a CD
2010-08-19T23:44:00.000Z	syn-ack	Magnetro	I generally do a fresh install when I upgrade.
2010-08-19T23:45:00.000Z	syn-ack	Magnetro	Anymore I only run the LTSs until the EOL so yeah
2010-08-19T23:46:00.000Z	syn-ack	Magnetro	I don't touch wine if I can help it
2010-08-19T23:46:00.000Z	syn-ack	Magnetro	I use Virtual Machines instead.
2010-08-19T23:48:00.000Z	syn-ack	Magnetro	yeppers
