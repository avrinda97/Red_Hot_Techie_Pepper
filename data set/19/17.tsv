2004-09-28T06:46:00.000Z	JanneM		ok, I have a first draft of a howto for using qemu - any suggestions what I do with it?
2004-09-28T06:46:00.000Z	JanneM		send to the mailing list?
2004-09-28T06:47:00.000Z	jdub	JanneM	perhaps mail -users?
2004-10-04T08:22:00.000Z	jdub	JanneM	should be pretty good
2004-10-04T08:22:00.000Z	jdub	JanneM	modulo wifi support :|
2004-10-26T16:53:00.000Z	jdub	JanneM	we want to do i* for hoary
2004-10-26T16:56:00.000Z	JanneM	jdub	thing is, I've used i* in the past, and I was surprised how much smoother uim seems to be
2004-10-26T16:56:00.000Z	jdub	JanneM	mmm, seems it's the growing standard though - so best to support and improve it...
2004-10-26T16:56:00.000Z	jdub	JanneM	perhaps we can provide both if it's easy to handle
2004-10-29T08:45:00.000Z	JanneM	jdub	true
2004-10-29T08:48:00.000Z	JanneM	jdub	real example?
2004-10-29T08:48:00.000Z	jdub	JanneM	including japanese input support and fonts
2004-10-29T08:48:00.000Z	JanneM	jdub	yep.
2004-10-29T08:48:00.000Z	jdub	JanneM	versus a tightly honed, minimal firewall derivative
2004-10-29T09:16:00.000Z	jdub	JanneM	bouncing a sacred animal is a bit over the top, though.
2004-11-07T09:40:00.000Z	jdub	JanneM	it's not package-dependent
2004-11-07T09:41:00.000Z	JanneM	jdub	how would apt know what MIME to register a packaged mplayer handles, for instance?
2004-11-07T09:42:00.000Z	jdub	JanneM	talking about gnome packages
2004-11-07T09:42:00.000Z	jdub	JanneM	if mplayer had a .desktop file, it would work too
