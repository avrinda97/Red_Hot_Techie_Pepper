2008-08-20T01:26:00.000Z	k31to		can someone please tell me the chmod settings for rwxr--r--?
2008-08-20T01:27:00.000Z	k31to		i'm trying sudo chmod -R 0744 /file/path
2008-08-20T01:27:00.000Z	gaintsura	k31to	thats um, 733?
2008-08-20T01:27:00.000Z	k31to	gaintsura	you sure? ;)
2008-08-20T01:27:00.000Z	k31to	gaintsura	thanks
2008-08-20T01:30:00.000Z	gaintsura	k31to	what was it?
2008-08-20T01:30:00.000Z	k31to	gaintsura	744?!
2008-08-20T01:30:00.000Z	gaintsura	k31to	hmm *ponders 733*
2008-08-20T01:31:00.000Z	k31to	gaintsura	no worries, I'm more worried about why I can't access the folder after running 744
2008-08-20T01:31:00.000Z	gaintsura	k31to	probably because you are not the owner
2008-08-20T01:33:00.000Z	k31to	gaintsura	you are indeed correct... but why then does it return the results of ls -l when the folder is set to 755 ?
2008-08-20T01:33:00.000Z	k31to	gaintsura	is 755 a safe setting for a nas share then?
2008-08-20T01:33:00.000Z	k31to	gaintsura	for *most* files
2008-08-20T01:34:00.000Z	gaintsura	k31to	how well do you trust the users?
2008-08-20T01:34:00.000Z	k31to	gaintsura	exactly...  surely adding executable rights to text files, movies and music isn't so bad? (right!)
2008-08-20T01:35:00.000Z	gaintsura	k31to	no, as long as they are not/do not have the ability of effecting the system
2008-08-20T01:36:00.000Z	k31to	gaintsura	no ts is only a samba share of music and movies
2008-08-20T01:36:00.000Z	k31to	gaintsura	thanks for the help , appreciate it
2008-08-20T01:38:00.000Z	gaintsura	k31to	np ^_^
