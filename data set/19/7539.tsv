2007-08-06T07:26:00.000Z	Naitsirk		How can I get my screen resolution higher than 1024 x 768 ?
2007-08-06T07:26:00.000Z	Naitsirk		My hardware should support much higher, but maybe it's not installed correctly or not supported?
2007-08-06T07:27:00.000Z	mr_dude	Naitsirk	What video card do you have?
2007-08-06T07:27:00.000Z	Naitsirk	mr_dude	XFX fatal1ty Geforce 7600 GT
2007-08-06T07:28:00.000Z	Naitsirk	mr_dude	it is recognised as G70 [GeForce 7600 GT] 
2007-08-06T07:28:00.000Z	mr_dude	Naitsirk	Did you install the latest Nvidia drivers?
2007-08-06T07:29:00.000Z	Naitsirk	mr_dude	I just installed a clean ubuntu desktop version using liveCD, not sure how to upgrade/find the best drivers.. can I use synaptic or browse for it?
2007-08-06T07:29:00.000Z	mr_dude	Naitsirk	Look up the script Envy in google, it will automate and install the latest Nvidia drivers and provide you with a way to add more resolutions very easily from a program that's added to your Applications menu.
2007-08-06T07:59:00.000Z	Naitsirk	mr_dude	I installed the envy script and nvidia driver, but when choosing my resolution (1600x1024) I get white horizontal stripes flashing up and down on my screen :/ suggestions?
2007-08-06T07:59:00.000Z	mr_dude	Naitsirk	What's the refresh rate set at?
2007-08-06T08:00:00.000Z	Naitsirk	mr_dude	Auto, and all i can choose is 60 hz
2007-08-06T08:04:00.000Z	Naitsirk	mr_dude	found out 1680 x 1050 was max resolution, so updated to that and the stripes went away :) cheers :D  ..now if I could only get the "Save to X configuration file" to work - "Uable to remove old X config backup file '/etc/X11/xorg.conf.backup'
2007-08-06T08:05:00.000Z	mr_dude	Naitsirk	Rename xorg.conf.backup to something else by using the mv command.
2007-08-06T08:07:00.000Z	Naitsirk	mr_dude	oops, i used rm and now I get: "Unable to create new X config backup file '/etc/X11/xorg.conf.backup'"
2007-08-06T08:07:00.000Z	mr_dude	Naitsirk	Type cat /etc/X11/xorg.conf does anything come up?
2007-08-06T08:08:00.000Z	mr_dude	Naitsirk	Type cat /etc/X11/xorg.conf.backup does anything come up?
2007-08-06T08:08:00.000Z	Naitsirk	mr_dude	yes, it list display information
2007-08-06T08:09:00.000Z	mr_dude	Naitsirk	I wouldn't worry about that error message if everything is working.
2007-08-06T08:14:00.000Z	Naitsirk	mr_dude	when restarting the resolution was back to 1024 x... and still won't let me save configuration
