2007-08-30T10:28:00.000Z	z0rz		Anyone have a recomendation for a good terminal replacement (aside xtemr)?
2007-08-30T10:29:00.000Z	z0rz		I want the emulator*
2007-08-30T10:29:00.000Z	marty_	z0rz	GNOME terminal seems fine, bash seems fine. Anything more specific you'd like to ask?
2007-08-30T10:30:00.000Z	z0rz	marty_	Yeah.. refer to my meta key question ^^
2007-08-30T10:30:00.000Z	marty_	z0rz	try edit>Keyboard Shortcuts ;-)
2007-08-30T10:31:00.000Z	marty_	z0rz	what do you want to accomplish?
2007-08-30T10:32:00.000Z	z0rz	marty_	When I press Alt+Left or Alt+Right to change between chans it says "3D" and "3C" instead of changing to different chans .. What do I need to change in Ubuntu's terminal to fix this?
2007-08-30T10:32:00.000Z	marty_	z0rz	chans? I use the terminal quite a bit, but I'm unsure what you mean...
2007-08-30T10:33:00.000Z	z0rz	marty_	Then I assume you don't know what irssi is
2007-08-30T10:33:00.000Z	marty_	z0rz	I assume you're right.
2007-08-30T10:33:00.000Z	z0rz	marty_	:D
2007-08-30T10:34:00.000Z	z0rz	marty_	You can still help if you know how to make gnome-terminal send a 'meta' key when I use Alt+Key combinations
2007-08-30T10:43:00.000Z	marty_	z0rz	you're in BSD? Well, should be sh, the original Bourne Shell, or Kornshell? I think just sh.
2007-08-30T10:46:00.000Z	marty_	z0rz	try bash --version, that would tell you if bash is there.
2007-08-30T10:46:00.000Z	z0rz	marty_	2.05b.0(1)-release (i386-unknown-openbsd3.4)
2007-08-30T10:47:00.000Z	marty_	z0rz	well, bash is there, then.
2007-08-30T10:47:00.000Z	z0rz	marty_	I guess my 98% assurity was pretty accurate
2007-08-30T10:48:00.000Z	marty_	z0rz	? I thout you said you weren't using bash now and wonder what you _were_ using?
2007-08-30T10:48:00.000Z	z0rz	marty_	You are probably read my "It's not bash" statement.. which I cleared up in my next message
