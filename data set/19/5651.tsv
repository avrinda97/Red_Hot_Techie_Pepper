2008-05-21T01:30:00.000Z	Nyad		How do I resize my ubuntu HD partition in the command line while in ubuntu?
2008-05-21T01:31:00.000Z	Pepsi_	Nyad	on a mounted partition ?
2008-05-21T01:31:00.000Z	Nyad		yes
2008-05-21T01:32:00.000Z	Nyad	Pepsi_	yes it is mounted
2008-05-21T01:32:00.000Z	Nyad	Pepsi_	it's what I'm booted into atm
2008-05-21T01:33:00.000Z	Pepsi_	Nyad	without unmounting the partition, it won't be possible to resize it
2008-05-21T01:33:00.000Z	Nyad		hmm, then I would probably have to use a gutsy liveCD
2008-05-21T01:34:00.000Z	Pepsi_	Nyad	indeed
2008-05-21T01:34:00.000Z	Nyad		but how do I go about resizing a partition?
2008-05-21T01:35:00.000Z	Pepsi_	Nyad	just use gparted, it is include on the livecd
2008-05-21T01:35:00.000Z	Pepsi_	Nyad	although it isn't command line
2008-05-21T01:36:00.000Z	Nyad	Pepsi_	I'm running kubuntu and I only have the kubuntu liveCD, would parted suffice?
2008-05-21T01:37:00.000Z	Pepsi_	Nyad	that would work indeed
2008-05-21T01:37:00.000Z	Pepsi_	Nyad	and do backup before resizing
2008-05-21T01:38:00.000Z	Pepsi_	Nyad	really :)
2008-05-21T01:38:00.000Z	Pepsi_	Nyad	there is also an article on how to resize on howtoforge
2008-05-21T01:39:00.000Z	Nyad	Pepsi_	parted has resize option but it wants a start and end. what would I put there?
2008-05-21T01:40:00.000Z	Pepsi_	Nyad	start and endpoint in megabytes
2008-05-21T01:41:00.000Z	Nyad	Pepsi_	wouldn't it just be start=0 and end=X   why would someone need a start? or is that part of the entire disk that start part?
