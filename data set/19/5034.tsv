2010-05-07T06:04:00.000Z	wubba		I am not getting any sound but lspci shows: 00:10.1 Audio device: nVidia Corporation MCP51 High Definition Audio (rev a2)
2010-05-07T06:04:00.000Z	wubba		any idea why I can't hear sound?  This worked before upgrading to 10.04
2010-05-07T06:05:00.000Z	DasEi	wubba	alsamixergui installed ?
2010-05-07T06:05:00.000Z	wubba	DasEi	not sure
2010-05-07T06:06:00.000Z	DasEi	wubba	sudo apt-get install alsamixergui && alsamixergui
2010-05-07T06:09:00.000Z	DasEi	wubba	so can you launch it ?
2010-05-07T06:10:00.000Z	wubba	DasEi	yes it launched on the install
2010-05-07T06:10:00.000Z	DasEi	wubba	is your s-card shown correctly in it's tilebar ?
2010-05-07T06:11:00.000Z	wubba	DasEi	The card is showing up as PulseAudio - I have a Nvidia
2010-05-07T06:12:00.000Z	DasEi	wubba	nah, pulse acts as a sound-proxy, and not as a s-card;  are the channels unmuted ?
2010-05-07T06:13:00.000Z	wubba	DasEi	on the mixer it shows green with little speakers
2010-05-07T06:13:00.000Z	wubba	DasEi	green means muted?
2010-05-07T06:13:00.000Z	DasEi	wubba	no, green is fine
2010-05-07T06:14:00.000Z	wubba	DasEi	The bar is about 3/4 up on both channels
2010-05-07T06:14:00.000Z	DasEi	wubba	so need some more debugging then, follow :
2010-05-07T06:15:00.000Z	wubba	DasEi	thanks - I will take a look
2010-05-07T06:16:00.000Z	DasEi	wubba	least I know card is supported, if it all fails, install latest alsa from source
2010-05-07T06:16:00.000Z	wubba	DasEi	it worked before upgrading to 10.04
2010-05-07T06:16:00.000Z	DasEi	wubba	as said, works with ubuntu, minor issue
