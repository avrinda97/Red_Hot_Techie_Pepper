2009-05-18T18:23:00.000Z	houdin8888		would someone suggest a good sound card for use in UBUNTU? I've really struggled (unsuccessfully) getting my Creative Sound Blaster X-Fi XtremeGamer Fatal1ty Pro card to function.. i wish i could, but, i'm too stupid, i guess.
2009-05-18T18:25:00.000Z	Piet	houdin8888	if you still have the card physically installed, please pastebin the output of this: sudo lspci -n && sudo lspci
2009-05-18T18:33:00.000Z	houdin8888	Piet	did you see the output from my running "sudo lspci -n && sudo lspci"?
2009-05-18T18:35:00.000Z	Piet	houdin8888	not yet, the url is?
2009-05-18T18:35:00.000Z	houdin8888	Piet	not sure what you mean. 'the url is?"
2009-05-18T18:36:00.000Z	houdin8888	Piet	I private messaged it to you.
2009-05-18T18:37:00.000Z	Piet	houdin8888	where can i see the output of the lspci commands?
2009-05-18T18:37:00.000Z	Piet	houdin8888	i do not accept private messages from unregistered users. please put it on a pastebin
2009-05-18T18:50:00.000Z	houdin8888	Piet	are you still there? I put the output to http://paste.ubuntu.com/174931/
2009-05-18T18:50:00.000Z	Piet	houdin8888	please paste the output of the commands i sent you to a pastebin. see above for ubottu's explanation how to use a pastebin service. once you are done, please copy the internet address and paste only this address here.
2009-05-18T18:56:00.000Z	houdin8888	Piet	are you still there? I put the output to http://paste.ubuntu.com/174931/. did you see it, yet?
2009-05-18T18:59:00.000Z	Piet	houdin8888	didn't see the URL yet, but will have a look now

2009-05-18T19:11:00.000Z	Piet	houdin8888	your sound card is not supported by jaunty, but it is likely to be supported in one of the next releases.
2009-05-18T19:12:00.000Z	houdin8888	Piet	thanks for checking into that for me. I had the feeling my card wasn't yet supported. So, again, would you or someone else suggest a good sound card that is supported?
2009-05-18T19:14:00.000Z	Piet	houdin8888	how about using your onboard chip?
2009-05-18T19:15:00.000Z	houdin8888	Piet	my onboard chip isn't supported, either.. its a mild nightmare.
2009-05-18T19:15:00.000Z	Piet	houdin8888	from your paste: 00:1b.0 Audio device: Intel Corporation 82801I (ICH9 Family) HD Audio Controller (rev 02)
2009-05-18T19:17:00.000Z	Piet	houdin8888	your onboard chip should be supported since linux 2.6.25 using snd-hda-intel
