2008-01-14T21:06:00.000Z	`m0		It is the webadmin's fault
2008-01-14T21:07:00.000Z	`m0		No, the website doens't work with firefox it needs IE, and linux doesn't have IE
2008-01-14T21:07:00.000Z	`m0		unless I do a wine iexplorer
2008-01-14T21:09:00.000Z	`m0		is there a way to reset my LOGIN screen?  When updating from gutsy my login screen doesn't show the users
2008-01-14T21:10:00.000Z	`m0		err the prev
2008-01-14T21:10:00.000Z	`m0		did it when it came out, but just wondering about it now
2008-01-14T21:11:00.000Z	sn0w	`m0	System -> Administration -> Login Window
2008-01-14T21:11:00.000Z	sn0w	`m0	just change to a skin that shows the user list
2008-01-14T21:12:00.000Z	`m0	sn0w	I have the skin for the user list ... But that didn't work after the update
2008-01-14T21:12:00.000Z	sn0w	`m0	so that is the one selected but it is still not showing up?
2008-01-14T21:12:00.000Z	`m0	sn0w	the userlist is empyu
2008-01-14T21:14:00.000Z	sn0w	`m0	oh, hmm not sure on that one maybe try a diff skin, you can get a ton from gnome-look.org
2008-01-14T21:14:00.000Z	`m0	sn0w	already did
2008-01-14T21:14:00.000Z	`m0	sn0w	after the update, the login screen is corrupted (i would guess) and I would want to see if I can recover it
2008-01-14T21:15:00.000Z	sn0w	`m0	have you tried reinstalling the gdm?
