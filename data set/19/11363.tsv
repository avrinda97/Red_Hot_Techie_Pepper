2006-02-23T17:55:00.000Z	twb	morphix	how many concurrent users?
2006-02-23T17:56:00.000Z	twb	morphix	then you spent about 10 times too much on hardware.
2006-02-23T17:56:00.000Z	morphix	twb	i got it way before i used ubuntu
2006-02-23T17:57:00.000Z	twb	morphix	that's at least eight times more than you need for *any* single-user desktop linux.
2006-02-23T17:57:00.000Z	twb	morphix	then you have my sympathy.
2006-02-23T17:59:00.000Z	twb	morphix	depending what your doing, of course...
