2005-09-24T12:00:00.000Z	angry_games		it will run the glxgears thing, but not fgl_glxgears
2005-09-24T12:01:00.000Z	angry_games		i think i am just going to destroy this drive and start over one more time...my graphics were totally corrupted after I restarted and they are pretty ugly right now
2005-09-24T12:02:00.000Z	angry_games		yes
2005-09-24T12:02:00.000Z	angry_games		i had to hit reset because the corruption was so bad that i couldnt see any menus at all
2005-09-24T12:02:00.000Z	angry_games		just a bunch of snow on the screen
2005-09-24T12:02:00.000Z	angry_games		well....does anyone know if latest Ubuntu supports the Nvidia NForce4 network controller without any hassle?
2005-09-24T12:03:00.000Z	angry_games		if it does, I will easily swap this out for an NF4 board and a 6800GT or 7800GT
2005-09-24T12:04:00.000Z	angry_games		i can always put an Intel Pro 10/100 NIC in it to get it up and running i guess
2005-09-24T12:05:00.000Z	angry_games		i know that SuSe 64-bit would not detect anything on the NF4 boards
2005-09-24T12:05:00.000Z	angry_games		should I download the 5.10 Breezy stuff, or the 5.04 Hoary?
2005-09-24T12:05:00.000Z	darkheart	angry_games	5.10 is still hoary isn't it?
2005-09-24T12:05:00.000Z	angry_games		it says breezy on the site
2005-09-24T12:06:00.000Z	darkheart	angry_games	Ok. But if you are using Breezy, then download the Breezy stuff.
2005-09-24T12:06:00.000Z	angry_games	botbuilder	the ALC850 Audio codec that most NF4's use is covered by Nvidia's Nforce chipset drivers....the MSI motherboard that has Creative integrated audio however is not
2005-09-24T12:07:00.000Z	angry_games		this that i am using is 5.04 Hoary...I should have asked "should I download Breezy 5.10 and try that?"
2005-09-24T12:07:00.000Z	angry_games		ie: is breezy 5.10 good and stable enough to fool with?
2005-09-24T12:08:00.000Z	angry_games		haha ok  let me download it on my WINDOWS SERVER lol
2005-09-24T12:08:00.000Z	angry_games		since i freakin know how to use Windows
2005-09-24T12:08:00.000Z	darkheart	angry_games	I've heard people have some trouble, but I think it's stable enough. If you want to wait, the stable release should be coming out in a couple weeks.
