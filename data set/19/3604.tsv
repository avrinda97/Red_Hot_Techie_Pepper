2009-09-01T04:41:00.000Z	Emery		what is the command to see what devices i have connected in terminal
2009-09-01T04:42:00.000Z	mechdave	Emery	what kind of devices you talking about?
2009-09-01T04:44:00.000Z	Emery	mechdave	usb stick
2009-09-01T04:45:00.000Z	mechdave	Emery	you could type in mount that will tell you what is mounted
2009-09-01T04:46:00.000Z	mechdave	Emery	then you could do a dmesg | grep /dev/whatever/your/usb/is/attached/to
2009-09-01T04:47:00.000Z	mechdave	Emery	that will tell you what it is
2009-09-01T04:47:00.000Z	Emery	mechdave	i did mount /media/sda1 /mnt/media and .. mount: special device /media/sda1 does not exist
2009-09-01T04:48:00.000Z	mechdave	Emery	try sudo mount -a /dev/sda1 /mnt/
2009-09-01T04:49:00.000Z	Emery	mechdave	i am root
2009-09-01T04:49:00.000Z	mechdave	Emery	get out of root and use sudo
2009-09-01T04:50:00.000Z	mechdave	Emery	using root is way too dangerous... even for me :)
2009-09-01T04:52:00.000Z	Emery	mechdave	i'm not a linux nub
2009-09-01T04:53:00.000Z	mechdave	Emery	Well ok, neither am I, I have been using Linux for about 10 years. Use root at your own risk.
2009-09-01T04:53:00.000Z	Emery	mechdave	i've been using it for 6
2009-09-01T04:54:00.000Z	mechdave	Emery	You need to find where the system has attached your usb stick in the /dev directory structure
2009-09-01T04:54:00.000Z	Emery	mechdave	it's just being a bitch
2009-09-01T04:55:00.000Z	mechdave	Emery	un plug your usb stick and then wait 30 secs to 1 min and then re plug it
2009-09-01T04:55:00.000Z	Emery	mechdave	i have
2009-09-01T04:56:00.000Z	mechdave	Emery	Then dmesg and see where your usb has been attached
