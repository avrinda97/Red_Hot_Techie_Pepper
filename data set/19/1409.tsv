2011-05-17T18:04:00.000Z	Sidewinder1		Or is it Conkie?
2011-05-17T18:04:00.000Z	Sidewinder1		Standby...
2011-05-17T18:04:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Sidewinder1	yes, conky
2011-05-17T18:11:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Sidewinder1	that is true of any linux
2011-05-17T18:12:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	ThinkT510	Certainly puts winbloze on the sidelines. Uh oh, OT...Side slaps himself in the face....Won't happen again. :-)
2011-07-28T16:04:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	ThinkT510	You beat me. :-)
2011-07-28T16:08:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	ThinkT510	Beat ma, again. :-(
2011-12-03T19:13:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	ThinkT510	That was my thought, as well.
2011-12-03T20:44:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	ThinkT510	C-Chat must be configured to log the chanel.
2011-12-03T20:45:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Sidewinder1	works for me straight off the bat, i always get a log of what was said last time when i log on again
2011-12-03T20:45:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Sidewinder1	are you thinking of xchat-gnome (the slimmed down thingy)
2011-12-03T20:46:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	ThinkT510	Perhaps logging is turned on, by default, when installing; turned mine off, a while ago..
2011-12-03T20:46:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	ThinkT510	I'm on 10.04, so perhaps, the answer is yes.. :D
2011-12-03T20:47:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Sidewinder1	i've only ever used the normal xchat so i wouldn't know about the defaults of xchat-gnome
2011-12-03T20:49:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	ThinkT510	Me neither; I just know that since I've used it, I turned off logging, to save disk space.
2011-12-03T23:32:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Sidewinder1	i wonder why people bother with ppa's at all
2011-12-03T23:33:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	ThinkT510	Being on 10.04, me too!
2012-07-27T16:32:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Sidewinder1	+1
2012-08-19T21:13:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Sidewinder1	eol for desktop support is fast approaching for 10.04
