2012-02-26T07:57:00.000Z	Ben64	Ernesto_	then you need a router or a switch
2012-02-26T08:01:00.000Z	Ben64	Ernesto_	you need a crossover cable, or two network cables and a hub, switch, or router
2012-02-26T08:05:00.000Z	Ben64	Ernesto_	then what are you trying to do
2012-02-26T08:06:00.000Z	Ben64	Ernesto_	no, what is your goal?
2012-02-26T08:07:00.000Z	Ernesto_	Ben64	how to mentiion you?

2012-02-26T08:07:00.000Z	Ernesto_	Ben64	Let me try
2012-02-26T08:10:00.000Z	Ben64	Ernesto_	just try to explain the problem you're having, theres probably a better solution than making a crossover cable
2012-02-26T08:12:00.000Z	Ben64	Ernesto_	why
2012-02-26T08:12:00.000Z	Ernesto_	Ben64	because i cant install os in my laptop so i need to secure files before i delete the entire disk (cant delete specific C: partition using windows cmd promt)
2012-02-26T08:13:00.000Z	Ben64	Ernesto_	can't install which os?
2012-02-26T08:13:00.000Z	Ernesto_	Ben64	I cant install Windows 7 again in my laptop any more.. It says all disk partitions are dynamic
2012-02-26T08:14:00.000Z	Ernesto_	Ben64	I wish i had a 1 TB Portable Hard drive :P
