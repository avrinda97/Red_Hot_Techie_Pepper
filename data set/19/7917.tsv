2010-06-06T05:50:00.000Z	YC		I'm actually using Fedora here thune3 , this stuff will still apply, I'm guessing
2010-06-06T05:50:00.000Z	YC		Still running Gnome after all
2010-06-06T05:51:00.000Z	YC		Most things, especially a keyboard, should be the same
2010-06-06T05:52:00.000Z	YC		I don't use Ubuntu
2010-06-06T05:52:00.000Z	YC		I mentioned that up there

2010-06-06T05:54:00.000Z	YC		I'm just trying to go to the place where I might get help getting it added to linux
2010-06-06T05:54:00.000Z	YC		You don't need to be like that bastid_raZor
2010-06-06T05:54:00.000Z	YC		I need help, I'm going anywhere I can to get it
2010-06-06T05:54:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	YC	you don't need to act the way you are when your issues have nothing today with ubuntu.
2010-06-06T05:53:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	YC	you're not using ubuntu but want keyboard support for yiddish?
2010-06-06T05:54:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	YC	if you're not using Ubuntu then throw such a big fit in #ubuntu?
2010-06-06T05:55:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	YC	#ubuntu is not going to be able to help you.. since you're not using Ubuntu
2010-06-06T05:55:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	YC	i understand perfectly. you're not using ubuntu yet you want #ubuntu to help you.
2010-06-06T05:57:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	YC	no, this channel is for ubuntu support. nothing else.
2010-06-06T05:57:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	YC	##linux or #fedora or whatever OS your using
2010-06-06T05:58:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	YC	good luck.
2010-06-06T05:58:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	YC	i do mean it.
