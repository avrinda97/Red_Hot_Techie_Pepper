2005-03-28T12:56:00.000Z	Madiba		gday sic
2005-03-28T12:57:00.000Z	Madiba		can i ask for some advice please?
2005-03-28T12:59:00.000Z	ompaul	Madiba	you can always ask
2005-03-28T13:00:00.000Z	ompaul	Madiba	and you most likely will get an answer unless no person in the channel knows the answer (or simular)
2005-03-28T13:01:00.000Z	Madiba	ompaul	thank you
2005-03-28T13:02:00.000Z	ompaul	Madiba	well what is your question, just jump right in and ask :)
2005-03-28T13:03:00.000Z	ompaul	Madiba	that depends on how you are connected to the outside world, how do you do that?
2005-03-28T13:05:00.000Z	ompaul	Madiba	okay you can providing you are not running a win modem (even that is possible but would drive a new user around the bend to have to do it every day :))
2005-03-28T13:06:00.000Z	Madiba	ompaul	im using a smartlink modem is that a winmodem
2005-03-28T13:07:00.000Z	ompaul	Madiba	you can - but the trouble factor would be very high to do it as something temporary - have you any linux experiance
2005-03-28T13:10:00.000Z	ompaul	Madiba	can you get an external serial modem?
2005-03-28T13:20:00.000Z	ompaul	Madiba	that question stands - and it is still valid :)
2005-03-28T13:21:00.000Z	ompaul	Madiba	can you tell me if you can get a serial modem?
2005-03-28T13:21:00.000Z	Madiba	ompaul	i could get one at work ,yes
2005-03-28T13:24:00.000Z	ompaul	Madiba	it would be good for that to remove the other modem from the machine to lessen the chances of confusion - in fact if it is not a win modem those commands  may just work with it - if they fail go for the serial
2005-03-28T13:25:00.000Z	ompaul	Madiba	the idea is that you do not need drivers - and where would you install the drivers? onto a floppy or burn the settings onto a cdrom - that is a whole new level of pain for a new user
2005-03-28T13:26:00.000Z	ompaul	Madiba	well you can give it a shot with your existing modem but I do not hold out much hope
2005-03-28T13:26:00.000Z	ompaul	Madiba	have fun
