2011-04-18T20:55:00.000Z	ThinkT510	sancas	sorry but i have no idea why one picks up more networks than the other
2011-04-18T21:31:00.000Z	ThinkT510	sancas	managed to figure out your network availability?
2011-04-18T21:33:00.000Z	sancas	ThinkT510	i think this is good because i test the networks controllers on windows and allways have the same
