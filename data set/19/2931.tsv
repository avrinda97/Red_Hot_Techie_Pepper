2009-11-30T06:56:00.000Z	agorist		Where do you install/put stand alone apps? Do you make a .file for them?
2009-11-30T06:57:00.000Z	rhorse	agorist	is it a single exec file or what?
2009-11-30T06:59:00.000Z	agorist	rhorse	- yes. Foxit Reader installs to just an executable & i noticed a .foxit dir in my home dir with a config file. Should I put the executable file in the .foxit dir??
2009-11-30T07:00:00.000Z	rhorse	agorist	no, put it in /usr/local/bin or /usr/bin -- it will find the config by itself
2009-11-30T07:01:00.000Z	rhorse	agorist	but make sure you chmod +x it so it will run!
2009-11-30T07:06:00.000Z	agorist	rhorse	- thanks.
2009-11-30T07:07:00.000Z	rhorse	agorist	how is it better than the native viewer in U?
2009-11-30T07:10:00.000Z	rhorse	agorist	how is foxit better than the Ubuntu reader?
2009-11-30T07:11:00.000Z	agorist	rhorse	- great question. I don't know, All I know is that ubuntu's default reader kept crashing on me. Literally every 10-20 minutes it would just crash
2009-11-30T07:13:00.000Z	rhorse	agorist	ok, one more Q: what version of Ubuntu?
2009-11-30T07:17:00.000Z	agorist	rhorse	- version 9.10. However, due to this, and some other issues, I'm now running 9.04 in the form of Mint (Please don't berate me)
2009-11-30T07:18:00.000Z	rhorse	agorist	ya, 9.10 is still kinda rough. I run 8.04/Mint Elyssa, cuz it's so stable.
2009-11-30T07:22:00.000Z	agorist	rhorse	- stability is important. Thanks a lot btw.
2009-11-30T07:23:00.000Z	rhorse	agorist	NP
2009-11-30T07:24:00.000Z	agorist	rhorse	-- really quick. How do I access the file system dir in the terminal?
2009-11-30T07:24:00.000Z	agorist	rhorse	- i need to get to usr/bin
2009-11-30T07:26:00.000Z	rhorse	agorist	well, just 'cd /usr/bin'. You will need to use 'sudo' before any copy commands cuz /usr/bin is root access only.
2009-11-30T07:28:00.000Z	agorist	rhorse	- sudo cd /usr/bin -- command not found
2009-11-30T07:28:00.000Z	rhorse	agorist	NOT for cd (!)
