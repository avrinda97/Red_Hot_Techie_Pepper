2011-10-15T08:33:00.000Z	johndoe_		hii, i was wondering if someone can help me out with vgaswitcheroo
2011-10-15T08:33:00.000Z	johndoe_		i have no idea how to install it or how to use it
2011-10-15T08:34:00.000Z	johndoe_		hi , can someone kindly walk me through how vga switcheroo works and how i can use it?
2011-10-15T08:35:00.000Z	arghx	johndoe_	it is "installed" by default since it's a kernel setting. do you have a /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo ?
2011-10-15T08:36:00.000Z	johndoe_	arghx	yeah its there
2011-10-15T08:36:00.000Z	arghx	johndoe_	then you can use it. with it, you can tell X and the kernel which card to use before starting X
2011-10-15T08:37:00.000Z	johndoe_	arghx	thank you, but how exactly do i tell the kernal how to use the intelhd card instead of the ati discrete card t?
2011-10-15T08:38:00.000Z	arghx	johndoe_	echo "IGD" > /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo/switch   is typical for enabling the internal card and "DIS" would be for the discrete card
2011-10-15T08:39:00.000Z	arghx	johndoe_	cat /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo/switch   to see which options you actually have and which one is currently selected
2011-10-15T08:40:00.000Z	johndoe_	arghx	thank you so much
2011-10-15T08:41:00.000Z	johndoe_	arghx	this is the output and im not really sure what it means 0: :Pwr:0000:01:00.0 1:+:Pwr:0000:00:02.0
2011-10-15T08:42:00.000Z	arghx	johndoe_	can you pastebin the output of lspci -nn ?
2011-10-15T08:44:00.000Z	johndoe_	arghx	also when i use the code "sudo echo OFF > /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo/switch" it says no such commamnd found
2011-10-15T08:45:00.000Z	arghx	johndoe_	cause "echo" is a bash intrinsic command
2011-10-15T08:46:00.000Z	johndoe_	arghx	so what can i exactly do with that?
2011-10-15T08:47:00.000Z	arghx	johndoe_	you can use a interactive root shell with sudo -i and enter the echo command there. or you use a script that runs suid root or in root context
2011-10-15T08:48:00.000Z	johndoe_	arghx	alright perfect it went through
2011-10-15T08:49:00.000Z	arghx	johndoe_	I'm not totally sure vgaswitcheroo works with your hardware. the output is very very sparse :(  I guess the numbers relate to your PCI slots but since you didn't pastebin the lspci command I cannot be sure
2011-10-15T08:50:00.000Z	johndoe_	arghx	im not really sure on how to pastebin the lspci command
