2007-10-24T04:34:00.000Z	cassandra		I don't think so, but I'll check synaptic.
2007-10-24T04:34:00.000Z	Jimdb	cassandra	 load emerald and it's supporting files using synaptic package manager.
2007-10-24T04:35:00.000Z	Jimdb	cassandra	 find and install fusion-icon
2007-10-24T04:35:00.000Z	Jimdb	cassandra	 and tell us if that all works
2007-10-24T04:36:00.000Z	Jimdb	cassandra	 if you install fusion-icon you can tell the system what window decorator to use.  so you can tell it to use metacity
2007-10-24T04:37:00.000Z	Jimdb	cassandra	 tell it to use metacity as your window manager.  and it will shift back to metacity's window decorator.
2007-10-24T04:41:00.000Z	cassandra	Jimdb	 ther was no fusion-icon when I searched in synaptic, but there is a compiz-fusion...
2007-10-24T04:43:00.000Z	Jimdb	cassandra	it isn't in synaptic.  go to google and search for fusion-icon install in gutsy
2007-10-24T04:46:00.000Z	Jimdb	cassandra	 try this  http://tombuntu.com/index.php/2007/08/26/compiz-fusion-tray-icon/
2007-10-24T04:49:00.000Z	cassandra	Jimdb	 Compiz did it. ^_^
