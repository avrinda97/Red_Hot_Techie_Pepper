2010-10-25T15:16:00.000Z	bobbi		i have a problem when enabling nvidia proprietary graphic driver, my virtual consoles (Ctrl-Alt-F[1-6]) are flickering and are unusable. what is this?
2010-10-25T15:17:00.000Z	karni	bobbi	lucky you, my are not even accessible ;d (ASUS UL30VT)
2010-10-25T15:19:00.000Z	bobbi	karni	your grpx drivers? :( i have google'd it, and one solution was something about framebuffer...
2010-10-25T15:19:00.000Z	karni	bobbi	didn't have time to look into that. I've just put I'm I don't have those tty accessible ;(
2010-10-25T15:19:00.000Z	karni	bobbi	my nvidia card is on, but system is using integrated chip for the time being
2010-10-25T15:20:00.000Z	karni	bobbi	(I've got 2 cards in my laptop)
2010-10-25T15:20:00.000Z	bobbi	karni	ok
2010-10-25T15:21:00.000Z	karni	bobbi	good luck with that. you might find someone here to help you. just ask from time to time :)
2010-10-25T15:21:00.000Z	karni	bobbi	preferably with your hardware specs / laptop model
2010-10-25T15:22:00.000Z	bobbi	karni	you're the first to answer :)
2010-10-25T15:22:00.000Z	karni	bobbi	I'd call it "welcoming to the same problem club" ;)
2010-10-25T15:24:00.000Z	bobbi	karni	hehe yeah, damn these proprietary drivers.
2010-10-25T15:24:00.000Z	karni	bobbi	true. that's why, eventually, I'm using noveau (if I'm using it. I'm not even sure)
2010-10-25T15:26:00.000Z	bobbi	karni	ok, maybe you have some idea of how i can apply proper resolution to my laptop without prop. drivers? because thats the reason i have to use them..
2010-10-25T15:27:00.000Z	karni	bobbi	some time ago there was xorg.conf ... but now it's legacy. I don't know how to change the resolution manually (from the console)
2010-10-25T15:28:00.000Z	bobbi	karni	ok, some googling ahead then, thx
2010-10-25T15:29:00.000Z	karni	bobbi	good luck mate
2010-10-25T15:29:00.000Z	karni	bobbi	^ xrandr :)
2010-10-25T15:30:00.000Z	bobbi	karni	acicula: ok i will look into that :)
