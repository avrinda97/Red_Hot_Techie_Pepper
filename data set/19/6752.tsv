2007-12-12T15:57:00.000Z	jq`	ikonia	so whats my best bet? downloading and burning xp onto a cd then installing vista over that installation and then installing ubuntu
2007-12-12T15:57:00.000Z	ikonia	jq`	what ever window install method you want
2007-12-12T15:58:00.000Z	jq`	ikonia	well i'd have to do xp first because thats could fit on a cd and i don't have dvd's. can you tell me a program that can burn iso's in ubuntu?
