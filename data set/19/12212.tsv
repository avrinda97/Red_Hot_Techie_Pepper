2006-05-14T05:16:00.000Z	avalost		anyone experiencing problems when doing upgrades with flashplayer-nonfree hanging up the update process?
2006-05-14T05:16:00.000Z	avalost		seems everytime I do an upgrade the thing stalls
2006-05-14T05:18:00.000Z	soundray	avalost	it probably can't download the archive.
2006-05-14T05:18:00.000Z	avalost	soundray	yes indeed.. I have tried using the flashplayer-update cmd and that gives and error
2006-05-14T05:19:00.000Z	soundray	avalost	proxy error?
2006-05-14T05:19:00.000Z	avalost	soundray	can't recall off  the top of my head..
2006-05-14T05:20:00.000Z	soundray	avalost	make sure you don't have a proxy set for wget connections. Check with 'env | grep -i proxy' and look in /etc/wgetrc
2006-05-14T05:22:00.000Z	avalost	soundray	proxy is set to on ;/
2006-05-14T05:22:00.000Z	soundray	avalost	no, it's not set if there is a # at the beginning of the line
2006-05-14T05:24:00.000Z	avalost	soundray	indeed, any other ideas then?
2006-05-14T05:24:00.000Z	soundray	avalost	env | grep -i proxy
2006-05-14T05:25:00.000Z	soundray	avalost	if there is a http_proxy or similar variable set, do 'export http_proxy=' before the upgrade
2006-05-14T05:25:00.000Z	avalost	soundray	 env | grep -i proxy returns nothing
2006-05-14T05:26:00.000Z	soundray	avalost	okay, then proxy settings aren't what's causing the trouble.
2006-05-14T05:27:00.000Z	avalost	soundray	I just wgetted a pic from my webserver
2006-05-14T05:28:00.000Z	soundray	avalost	gotta go. Hope you can fix it.
2006-10-25T06:33:00.000Z	soundray	avalost	unzip unpacks the file to the current dir, you just need to give it the full path to the zipfile.
2006-10-25T06:34:00.000Z	avalost	soundray	unzip *.zip -ed /path/to/dir?
2006-10-25T06:36:00.000Z	soundray	avalost	I don't think there is a -e option. -d should work, though.
