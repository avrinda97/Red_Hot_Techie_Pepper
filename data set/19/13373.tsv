2005-04-10T13:07:00.000Z	jldugger		anyone know if lm-sensors supports nforce3 motherboards?
2005-04-10T13:09:00.000Z	jldugger		unless their favorite distro already packages it
2005-04-10T13:09:00.000Z	jldugger		or rather the software they want
2005-04-10T13:09:00.000Z	jldugger		not the autopackager
2005-04-10T13:11:00.000Z	jldugger		i would have thought kill -9 as super user would fix anything
2005-04-10T13:13:00.000Z	jldugger		wierd
2005-04-10T13:15:00.000Z	jldugger		ok
2005-04-10T13:16:00.000Z	jldugger		i didnt realize the metaphor was so complete
2005-04-10T13:16:00.000Z	jldugger		totem totally fucks up as a media player for me
2005-04-10T13:16:00.000Z	jldugger		i prefer xine
2005-04-10T13:17:00.000Z	FlimFlamMan	jldugger	i was surprised to see totem play back realmedia streams from c-span.org where everything else failed
2005-04-10T13:17:00.000Z	jldugger		i donno what it is, but after the first file, totem is done until i restart it
2005-04-10T13:17:00.000Z	FlimFlamMan		ni hau
2005-04-10T13:17:00.000Z	jldugger	FlimFlamMan	maybe its something about warty vs hoary
2005-04-10T13:17:00.000Z	FlimFlamMan	jldugger	actually i was on sid
2005-04-10T13:18:00.000Z	jldugger		ah, good old sid
2005-04-10T13:18:00.000Z	jldugger		is there an ubuntu version of sid?
2005-04-10T13:19:00.000Z	jldugger		oh, that's another good one! gstreamer preferences will crash on me
2005-04-10T13:20:00.000Z	FlimFlamMan	jldugger	i too have had crashiness with gstreamer in the past, but just using totem has never caused me problems
