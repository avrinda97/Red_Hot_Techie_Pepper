2011-06-14T06:31:00.000Z	edbian	BeBo	What is it called in the output of lspci ?
2011-06-14T06:32:00.000Z	BeBo	edbian	: what is that ?
2011-06-14T06:32:00.000Z	edbian	BeBo	lspci is a command that lists hardware connected to your pc.  It is a command you run in the terminal
2011-06-14T06:34:00.000Z	BeBo	edbian	: sorry i now using ms windows 7 because i install ubuntu 10.10 because i need wireless
2011-06-14T06:34:00.000Z	edbian	BeBo	You need to be running ubuntu to debug ubuntu
2011-06-14T06:34:00.000Z	edbian	BeBo	It is not a simple thing to fix unfortunately
2011-06-14T06:36:00.000Z	BeBo	edbian	: so i have to use ubuntu 10.10 until ubuntu 11.10 coming and i hope they will fix this proplem
2011-06-14T06:36:00.000Z	edbian	BeBo	It probably can be fixed.  But you have to boot it in order to figure out how to fix it.
2011-06-14T06:39:00.000Z	BeBo	edbian	: i tried to change kernel
2011-06-14T06:39:00.000Z	edbian	BeBo	What card do you have listed in lspci ?
2011-06-14T06:40:00.000Z	BeBo	edbian	: and still not fixed
2011-06-14T06:41:00.000Z	BeBo	edbian	: i told you i'm now using ms windows 7
2011-06-14T06:41:00.000Z	edbian	BeBo	and I told you.  You need to boot Ubuntu!
2011-06-14T06:42:00.000Z	BeBo	edbian	: ok but how i can conect to you throw here too
2011-06-14T06:44:00.000Z	edbian	BeBo	You'll have to go back and forth I'm afraid.  I suggest getting a second machine.  I have to go now though :(
2011-06-14T06:45:00.000Z	BeBo	edbian	: ok,bye
