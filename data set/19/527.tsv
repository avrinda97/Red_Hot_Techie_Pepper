2012-01-15T21:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Masters	there is a 3rd party ppa, it may break some things
2012-01-15T21:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Masters	sure, via ppa purge
2012-01-15T21:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Masters	press ALT+F2 and run: ccsm
2012-01-15T21:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Masters	you will need to disable the unity plugin then disable the sideway unity one
2012-01-15T22:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Masters	sudo add-apt-repository ppaaddress    change ppaaddress for the actual address of the ppa

2012-01-15T22:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Masters	if you try and guess things, it more than likely won't work
2012-01-15T22:13:00.000Z	Masters	ActionParsnip	if I think I did something wrong or its not working, will it cause problems if I run the comands again?
2012-01-15T22:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Masters	if you want the folder read and writable you'll need that command
2012-01-15T22:14:00.000Z	Masters	ActionParsnip	what folder?
2012-01-15T22:22:00.000Z	Masters	ActionParsnip	what was that link again to the guide?
