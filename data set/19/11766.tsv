2008-01-20T07:53:00.000Z	oreth		guys
2008-01-20T07:53:00.000Z	oreth		im an idiot
2008-01-20T07:53:00.000Z	oreth		i installed 8.04 some time back
2008-01-20T07:54:00.000Z	oreth		without realizing that I was on AMD64
2008-01-20T07:54:00.000Z	oreth		i think that is why my cd burning always fails
2008-01-20T07:54:00.000Z	oreth		and my dvd burning fails
2008-01-20T07:54:00.000Z	oreth		and everything is clunky
2008-01-20T07:54:00.000Z	oreth		yeah
2008-01-20T07:54:00.000Z	oreth		the normal x386 install
2008-01-20T07:55:00.000Z	oreth		well
2008-01-20T07:55:00.000Z	dman	oreth	that shouldn';t have any bad effects. just not any of the advantages of 64-bit. cd burning should work fine.
2008-01-20T07:55:00.000Z	oreth	dman	:(
2008-01-20T07:56:00.000Z	dman	oreth	yeah, what robdig said. that's most likely your problem. a bug
2008-01-20T07:57:00.000Z	dman	oreth	back up first. lol
2008-01-20T07:58:00.000Z	dman	oreth	faster speeds on encoding, archiving, etc. stuff like that. lets you use more ram. downside is much less compatibility
2008-01-20T08:00:00.000Z	dman	oreth	i doubt it. not enough to make it worth the hassle yet.
2008-01-20T08:01:00.000Z	dman	oreth	i don't think you can. just back up, then reinstall
2008-01-20T08:02:00.000Z	dman	oreth	sorry, but that's how it is =[
2008-01-20T08:03:00.000Z	dman	oreth	it happens. you'll know better next itme.
