2007-12-26T20:58:00.000Z	Pici	Urbandale1990	What are you trying to do that gives this error?
2007-12-26T21:00:00.000Z	Pici	Urbandale1990	Does NWN work? or does it just give you that error and quit?
2007-12-26T21:01:00.000Z	Urbandale1990	Pici	when i 'mkdir ~/.kde/socket-kim-desktop' and rerun, it returns 'mcop warning: user defined signal handler found for SIG_PIPE, overriding. Failed to initialize graphics. Aborted (core dumped)
2007-12-26T21:03:00.000Z	Pici	Urbandale1990	Have you tried running nwn with bash instead of just doing ./nwn ?
2007-12-26T21:04:00.000Z	Pici	Urbandale1990	Well, you're doing ./nwn right now to run the game, right?
2007-12-26T21:04:00.000Z	Urbandale1990	Pici	right...
2007-12-26T21:05:00.000Z	Pici	Urbandale1990	do this:  bash nwn
2007-12-26T21:09:00.000Z	Pici	Urbandale1990	Also try removing the grave accents ` from OPT_USERNAME=`kim`
2007-12-26T21:09:00.000Z	Pici	Urbandale1990	Turns out I was looking at your post when I searched for this on the forums
2007-12-26T21:11:00.000Z	Pici	Urbandale1990	it says OPT_USERNAME=`kim`  change it to OPT_USERNAME=kim
2007-12-26T21:12:00.000Z	Pici	Urbandale1990	Oh.. nevermind.
2007-12-26T21:13:00.000Z	Pici	Urbandale1990	I was looking in that script that you posted along with your question.  Typically those accents ` should not be used in config files, they mean something else when used on the command line.
2007-12-26T21:14:00.000Z	Pici	Urbandale1990	Thats what I would do, but I'm not sure if its going to work.
