2011-05-12T22:10:00.000Z	Almehdi	fathead	That means you have no DE or applications installed... so install Gnome
2011-05-12T22:05:00.000Z	Almehdi	fathead	cause the thing you do while on a live session dissipate when rebooted
2011-05-12T22:06:00.000Z	Almehdi	fathead	Do it give you a login promt or what does it say?
2011-05-12T22:08:00.000Z	Almehdi	fathead	type "startx"
2011-05-12T22:08:00.000Z	Almehdi	fathead	did you use the alternate live cd?
2011-05-12T22:11:00.000Z	Almehdi	fathead	type "sudo apt-get update" then "sudo apt-get upgrade"
2011-05-12T22:11:00.000Z	Almehdi	fathead	then "sudo apt-get install gnome firefox
2011-05-12T22:14:00.000Z	Almehdi	fathead	You could mount the minimal iso and then chroot into it and install gnome and firefox
2011-05-12T22:16:00.000Z	Almehdi	fathead	it should only be "sudo apt-get install firefox"
