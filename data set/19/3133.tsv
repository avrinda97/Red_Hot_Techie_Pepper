2009-10-21T02:52:00.000Z	jrib	Garnol9956	where is the official ubuntu tutorial you speak of?
2009-10-21T02:53:00.000Z	Garnol9956	jrib	its on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompilingEasyHowTo
2009-10-21T02:53:00.000Z	jrib	Garnol9956	it's a wiki, you can fix it!
2009-10-21T02:59:00.000Z	Garnol9956	jrib	the tutorial i sent you is very confusing
2009-10-21T03:06:00.000Z	Garnol9956	jrib	can you help me to install this source code driverhttp://aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=ipw3945 ??
2009-10-21T03:06:00.000Z	jrib	Garnol9956	aircrack should be in the repositories...
2009-10-21T03:09:00.000Z	jrib	Garnol9956	you're sure that driver isn't in the repositories?
2009-10-21T03:10:00.000Z	jrib	Garnol9956	anyway, what do you have a question about on that page?
2009-10-21T03:13:00.000Z	Garnol9956	jrib	i try to follow this page but i am stuck with the driver because i have to compile it. I didnt fond the ipwraw -ng driver in the repositories. The page again is: http://aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=ipw3945
2009-10-21T03:13:00.000Z	jrib	Garnol9956	yes, what part of that page are you stuck on?
2009-10-21T03:14:00.000Z	Garnol9956	jrib	its the part next to "installation"
2009-10-21T03:14:00.000Z	jrib	Garnol9956	specifically, what don't you know how to do?
2009-10-21T03:14:00.000Z	jrib	Garnol9956	I assume you can download the driver...
2009-10-21T03:14:00.000Z	Garnol9956	jrib	the make command gives errors
2009-10-21T03:17:00.000Z	Garnol9956	jrib	http://paste.ubuntu.com/297834/ thanks for having a look at my problems
2009-10-21T03:18:00.000Z	jrib	Garnol9956	did you read the output?
2009-10-21T03:19:00.000Z	Garnol9956	jrib	the first and last lines, but i didnt find the mistake
2009-10-21T03:20:00.000Z	jrib	Garnol9956	well I doubt the shell remark is related, but do it anyway to rule it out.  Then make sure you've installed the headers for your kernel
2009-10-21T03:22:00.000Z	Garnol9956	jrib	i tried the make=SHELL ..... same result
