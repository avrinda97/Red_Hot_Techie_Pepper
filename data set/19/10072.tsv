2006-07-30T15:05:00.000Z	eLoC		does anybody know what file do i edit to put a command to execute in the boot of the OS?
2006-07-30T15:06:00.000Z	timalot	eLoC	inittab :)
2006-07-30T15:07:00.000Z	eLoC	timalot	but where is it? /dev? i'm a newbie in linux... and i'm trying to discover how it works, lol
2006-07-30T15:07:00.000Z	timalot	eLoC	whats the command?
2006-07-30T15:08:00.000Z	timalot	eLoC	if it's daemon installed in a package then it usually automatically starts
2006-07-30T15:09:00.000Z	eLoC	timalot	i've installed it "manually" :S
2006-07-30T15:10:00.000Z	timalot	eLoC	no dont put it in inittab.... it was a nerdly joke
2006-07-30T15:10:00.000Z	timalot	eLoC	ok
2006-07-30T15:10:00.000Z	eLoC	timalot	ok, i thought i could edit it
2006-07-30T15:14:00.000Z	eLoC	timalot	the files in the path /etc/rc2.d, are like this: S99filename. if i want to start the teamspeak server, then i create a file in the init.d path called "teamspeak" with the command that will be executed... and after this, i call the file "teamspeak" in rc2.d with another file called S99teamspeak?
2006-07-30T15:15:00.000Z	eLoC	timalot	i'll try it here! Thanx for the help!!!
