2011-08-21T15:25:00.000Z	salvatore		what you intend with alias? i changed DocmentRoot because i moved my www folder to dropbox
2011-08-21T15:27:00.000Z	oCean	salvatore	when installing phpmyadmin, it should create a /etc/apache2/conf.d/phpmyadmin.conf file
2011-08-21T15:28:00.000Z	oCean	salvatore	in your apache2.conf should be an include line to include all these files in apache2/conf.d
2011-08-21T15:29:00.000Z	salvatore	oCean	i havent got /etc/apache2/conf.d/phpmyadmin.conf
2011-08-21T15:29:00.000Z	oCean	salvatore	did you install the software from the ubuntu repositories?
2011-08-21T15:31:00.000Z	oCean	salvatore	but you do have an /etc/phpmyadmin/apache.conf ?
2011-08-21T15:34:00.000Z	oCean	salvatore	very strange that the other link was not created. It should have been created at install. You can create it:   sudo ln -s /etc/phpmyadmin/apache.conf /etc/apache2/conf.d/phpmyadmin.conf
2011-08-21T15:35:00.000Z	oCean	salvatore	also, when you run this:   grep -i include /etc/apache2/apache2.conf |grep -v ^#     several lines should show, and 1 should be  Include conf.d/
2011-08-21T15:37:00.000Z	oCean	salvatore	have you created the link?
2011-08-21T15:37:00.000Z	oCean	salvatore	I think you have to restart the apache2 server:  sudo service apache2 restart
2011-08-21T15:40:00.000Z	oCean	salvatore	test it? And keep an eye on the logs in /var/log/apache2
2011-08-21T15:40:00.000Z	salvatore	oCean	now i got this message: Wrong permissions on configuration file, should not be world writable!
2011-08-21T15:41:00.000Z	oCean	salvatore	well, something messed up your installation. I'm not sure which configuration file? What is the permissions on /etc/phpmyadmin/apache2.conf? Should be 644
2011-08-21T15:42:00.000Z	oCean	salvatore	that is not a clever thing to do
2011-08-21T15:43:00.000Z	oCean	salvatore	that messed up your permissions
2011-08-21T15:44:00.000Z	oCean	salvatore	yes, but several linux programs check that the security/permissions is not set too open.
2011-08-21T15:44:00.000Z	oCean	salvatore	linux has lots of security systems build in. Don't mess with that, such workaround always end in error
2011-08-21T15:45:00.000Z	oCean	salvatore	yes
2011-08-21T15:46:00.000Z	oCean	salvatore	there are *many* configurationfiles. Some have 644, some have other permissions
