2010-03-31T20:53:00.000Z	ThJ		Can anyone explain to me why such a simple thing as adjusting mouse sensitivity has never worked for me in any distribution of Linux I've ever used? Such a seemingly simple thing...
2010-03-31T20:54:00.000Z	maginot	ThJ	conspiracy ?
2010-03-31T20:55:00.000Z	ThJ	maginot	annoying as "#Â¤# ... Linux UIs have borrowed tons of other concepts from Windows and other OSes, but mouse adjustments? Naah...
2010-03-31T20:55:00.000Z	maginot	ThJ	windows took concepts from UNIX
2010-03-31T20:55:00.000Z	maginot	ThJ	and windows doesn't have sensibility adjustments out of the box, you always have to use a driver for that
2010-03-31T20:56:00.000Z	ThJ	maginot	UNIX? I suppose. The first versions of Windows were blatant ripoffs of Apple.
2010-03-31T20:56:00.000Z	maginot	ThJ	this is out of subject here...
2010-03-31T20:56:00.000Z	ThJ	maginot	Not true. Any old driverless mouse is adjustable.
2010-03-31T20:57:00.000Z	maginot	ThJ	what the heck are you talking about? You can make many more adjustments on linux out of the box to your mouse them windows... will not argue this with you
2010-03-31T20:58:00.000Z	maginot	ThJ	System > Preferences > Mouse
2010-03-31T20:58:00.000Z	ThJ	maginot	Ubuntu offers me two sliders for mouse speed related things. Admittedly, Windows offers me only one slider, and a checkbox, but does what I am in need of right now.
2010-03-31T20:59:00.000Z	ThJ	maginot	I don't have my digitizer tablet with me, and I want to draw on the computer, so I want my mouse to have no acceleration and a low speed.
2010-03-31T21:01:00.000Z	maginot	ThJ	this is what I have: http://picpaste.com/Captura_de_tela.png
2010-03-31T21:02:00.000Z	ThJ	maginot	No pic here, it says.
2010-03-31T21:03:00.000Z	maginot	ThJ	yeah, just updated the picture to English http://picpaste.com/Captura_de_tela-1.png
2010-03-31T21:04:00.000Z	maginot	ThJ	try to fix the problem don't keep complaining of it... you don't pay to use linux after all
2010-03-31T21:05:00.000Z	ThJ	maginot	I would, if the XInput architecture wasn't such a complete horror XD
2010-03-31T21:06:00.000Z	maginot	ThJ	my tablet works pretty good, my wacon and my genius
2010-03-31T21:06:00.000Z	ThJ	maginot	yes, but the API, it is complex.
