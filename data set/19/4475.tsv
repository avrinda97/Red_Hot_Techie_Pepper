2009-02-27T16:08:00.000Z	lollan		I installed unbuntu on my USB disk but it wrote grun into the mbr of my internal hdd, so I wrote back the mbr and then I thought that If from the bios I ask to start from the usb key it will work, but it didn't. What I want basically is to install ubuntu on my usb disk, all of it.

2009-02-27T16:09:00.000Z	vigo	lollan	Maybe put the USB stick in and run fix grub
2009-02-27T16:11:00.000Z	lollan	vigo	I am going to reinstall it, since I rewrite the mbr with windows booter, but I don't want to have the same problem twice, my idea was to install ubuntu all on my usb drive and then plug it if I want to run linux.
2009-02-27T16:14:00.000Z	vigo	lollan	Yes, ok, just download the USB or to USB, then maybe want to set BIOS to look for USB as first boot, or just boot into windows, then it might autodetect, that would be like running from a liveCD. sorta
2009-02-27T16:15:00.000Z	vigo	lollan	If the system is not installed, it is not installed, see what I mean?
2009-02-27T16:16:00.000Z	lollan	vigo	sorry I didn't get that. what do you mean by download the usb ? The system is installed but can't boot because I deleted grub, I already set the bios to start the usb drive but ubuntu didn't start.
2009-02-27T16:16:00.000Z	vigo	lollan	Right, you need to fix grub, it is a command, hold on
2009-02-27T16:17:00.000Z	vigo	lollan	Here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
2009-02-27T16:18:00.000Z	vigo	lollan	That is fix grub and update grub, which is the most likely error
2009-02-27T16:18:00.000Z	lollan		thanks vigo I got check it out
2009-02-27T16:20:00.000Z	lollan	vigo	thanks but I have no access to ubuntu anymore, since I could'nt started I'm on windows. What I would like is some info on how avoid to do the same mistake (installing grub into internal hdd instead of the usb hdd) twice.
2009-02-27T16:23:00.000Z	vigo	lollan	Update Grub will update and repair the current Grub, I think the Grub on the USB is faulty, or sounds like it, maybe try a fresh download, check the MD5! then install the new clean Ubuntu onto USB, that is probably or is the best solution that I can muster up.
2009-02-27T16:24:00.000Z	lollan	vigo	my problem is that there was no grub on the usb otherwise it would boot when from the bios I boot on the usb drive. can't use update grub because no access to ubuntu.
2009-02-27T16:26:00.000Z	vigo	lollan	Right, in windows download a fresh version to that USB, it will or should replace the Grub to a working one.
2009-02-27T16:26:00.000Z	lollan		ok vigo thanks
2009-02-27T16:30:00.000Z	lollan	vigo	there is no grub into my usb
2009-02-27T16:32:00.000Z	vigo	lollan	Aha! that is why it will not boot, I think, so do a fresh download, check the MD5 , then put it on the USB fresh.
