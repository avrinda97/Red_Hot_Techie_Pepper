2006-06-30T13:01:00.000Z	ompaul	Intelligi	please put all your comments about the issue on one line then someone stands a chance of seeing it in one go - scattered over 10 minutes looses your audience#
2006-06-30T13:04:00.000Z	ompaul	Intelligi	if your card is not supported out of the box you need to  install is using ndiswrapper
2006-07-01T05:43:00.000Z	ompaul	Intelligi	as you have been here for hours has it not occured to you that those who get help ask informed direct questions of the channel and wait for a reply
2006-07-01T05:47:00.000Z	ompaul	Intelligi	I told you ndiswrapper eariler, if it worked last night then click on System Administration Networking and work on it from there
2006-07-01T05:48:00.000Z	ompaul	Intelligi	get other card or router and test setup
2006-07-01T05:48:00.000Z	ompaul	Intelligi	it does not stop working unless you do something
2006-07-01T05:49:00.000Z	ompaul	Intelligi	did you try that menu I pointed you to?
2006-07-01T05:50:00.000Z	ompaul	Intelligi	so you installed got it working and between the install and the shutdown you added something that broke the network
2006-07-01T05:50:00.000Z	ompaul	Intelligi	if it worked yesterday then it should work today
2006-07-01T05:50:00.000Z	ompaul	Intelligi	and other things no doubt
2006-07-01T05:51:00.000Z	ompaul	Intelligi	is it some kind of usb device?
2006-07-01T05:51:00.000Z	ompaul	Intelligi	does lspci show it?
2006-07-01T05:54:00.000Z	ompaul	Intelligi	how did you get it to work the first time?
2006-07-01T05:54:00.000Z	ompaul	Intelligi	got any other slots?
2006-07-01T05:55:00.000Z	ompaul	Intelligi	that was misunderstood, was it in a slot other than the one it is in
2006-07-01T05:56:00.000Z	ompaul	Intelligi	okay do this - turn it off move it and turn it on again
2006-07-01T06:02:00.000Z	ompaul	Intelligi	- note this, pci and usb can at times do things we don't quite grok easiest to just move the device
