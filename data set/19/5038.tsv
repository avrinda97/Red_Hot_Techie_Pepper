2008-09-14T13:48:00.000Z	kevin_needs_help		Anyone wanna help with a frusterated ubuntu noob trying to fix his nvidia driver?
2008-09-14T13:48:00.000Z	koshari	kevin_needs_help	whats actually wrong with it?
2008-09-14T13:50:00.000Z	koshari	kevin_needs_help	copt back your xorg.conf file. you did back up the original one before you edited it?
2008-09-14T13:51:00.000Z	kevin_needs_help	koshari	i'll be back to square 1 w/ my synaptics device if i revert...
2008-09-14T13:51:00.000Z	koshari	kevin_needs_help	save the edited one, you obviousely have dont something in the screen or monitor section
2008-09-14T13:52:00.000Z	kevin_needs_help	koshari	i dont think that I did...but i'll double check..
2008-09-14T13:55:00.000Z	koshari	kevin_needs_help	thats ok, nothing woth doing can be mastered ovenight
2008-09-14T13:56:00.000Z	kevin_needs_help	koshari	im a programmer..i should be able to pull something simple like this off
2008-09-14T13:58:00.000Z	koshari	kevin_needs_help	lets hope so
2008-09-14T13:59:00.000Z	kevin_needs_help	koshari	i ran a diff -- only mouse seeetings changed....
2008-09-14T13:59:00.000Z	kevin_needs_help	koshari	is there a way i can just have ubuntu auto-detect and reinstall what i need?
2008-09-14T13:59:00.000Z	koshari	kevin_needs_help	that would depend on the hardware, my synaptic touch pad "just works" other hardware needs some tweaking
2008-09-14T14:00:00.000Z	kevin_needs_help	koshari	right...well on the fresh install of ubuntu..all worked fine. It wasn't till i tried using the "cool" features like the cube and such....that problems started.
2008-09-14T14:02:00.000Z	koshari	kevin_needs_help	if you have problems the logical way to isolate the problem is to roll back to a working install, then figure out the things that arent working, thats why its always good to backup files such as xorg.conf , fstab and menu.1st
2008-09-14T14:03:00.000Z	kevin_needs_help	koshari	like I said... <3 window's registry -- us windows users know not to mess with it -- so what do you suggest i do?
2008-09-14T14:05:00.000Z	koshari	kevin_needs_help	you need to isolate the problem, if as i mentioned its an xorg issue which would be unusual due to your diff output you need chage that, its easy to swap the original xorg cont alt backspace back into x and check it ,
2008-09-14T14:06:00.000Z	koshari	kevin_needs_help	otherwise you can always boot a live session and get your issues sorted there and backup the xorg file to a usb disk ect and overwrite it back in the installed issue, remmember theres always more than one way to skin a cat, but you still need to isolate the problem
2008-09-14T14:09:00.000Z	kevin_needs_help	koshari	alright -- I'll revert to a "working" config and go from there ... thanks for the help
2008-09-14T14:09:00.000Z	koshari	kevin_needs_help	good luck
