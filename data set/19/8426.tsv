2010-03-02T00:39:00.000Z	Grey_Loki		Hi, I can't log in to MSN messenger using any client - Empathy, centerim, finch, the web messenger client in firefox, etc. HOw can I go about debugging this?
2010-03-02T00:39:00.000Z	frostburn	Grey_Loki	try pidgin? what are the errors you're seeing?
2010-03-02T00:42:00.000Z	Grey_Loki	frostburn	one sec while I install it, though i've not experienced any errors with any client - they all just fail to connect
2010-03-02T00:45:00.000Z	Grey_Loki	frostburn	pidgin tells me that my connection was refused
2010-03-02T00:46:00.000Z	Grey_Loki	frostburn	slight update, seems that web-messenger does work, but i'd much rather have a decent client running :D
2010-03-02T00:52:00.000Z	frostburn	Grey_Loki	check with #pidgin with your error message
2010-03-02T00:56:00.000Z	frostburn	Grey_Loki	check with #pidgin with your error message
2010-03-02T00:56:00.000Z	frostburn	Grey_Loki	are you at work? do they block that port?
2010-03-02T00:57:00.000Z	Grey_Loki	frostburn	at home, ports are forwarded, though fwiw (should've mentioned this earlier, sorry) I can't sign on with anything but the official client in Windows
2010-03-02T00:57:00.000Z	frostburn	Grey_Loki	wait, so you have your firewall redirect all msn traffic to your windows box?
2010-03-02T00:58:00.000Z	Grey_Loki	frostburn	my windows box is my ubuntu box, and no, not by default - tried it for testing, and it didn't seem to make any difference
2010-03-02T01:01:00.000Z	frostburn	Grey_Loki	the next troublshooting step would be to install tcpdump and investigate why the packets aren't reaching where they are supposed to
2010-03-02T01:02:00.000Z	Grey_Loki	frostburn	righto, gimme a few mins to install and look for howtos or peruse man pages, etc
2010-03-02T01:03:00.000Z	frostburn	Grey_Loki	wireshark might be a little easier that tcpdump it's basically a gui to libpcap
2010-03-02T01:04:00.000Z	Grey_Loki	frostburn	just did a quick ping - messenger.hotmail.com isn't responding (IP is 64.4.9.254, and that doesn't respond to ping either)
2010-03-02T01:05:00.000Z	frostburn	Grey_Loki	try mtr messenger.hotmail.com
2010-03-02T01:08:00.000Z	Grey_Loki	frostburn	a few IPs in the list seem to be losing packets, the main one is 213.123.109.6. Want a pastebin of the output?
2010-03-02T01:11:00.000Z	frostburn	Grey_Loki	nah thats ok, not all hops will respond to ping, i'm really not familiar on how msn handshakes, the folks in #pidgin or other places would know the protocol better than i
2010-03-02T01:12:00.000Z	Grey_Loki	frostburn	righto, i'll move on over and bother them for a bit - thanks for pointing me in the right direction (and introducing me to mtr - seems to be a rather handy tool! :D)
