2009-04-30T11:04:00.000Z	space_cadet	Kengine	silver oxide is conductive
2009-04-30T11:05:00.000Z	Kengine	space_cadet	what does that mean ? its not good ?
2009-04-30T11:05:00.000Z	space_cadet	Kengine	best to use alcohal to clean the old residue off
2009-04-30T11:05:00.000Z	space_cadet	Kengine	conductive to electricity
2009-04-30T11:05:00.000Z	space_cadet	Kengine	you short out the databus to the cpu your done
2009-04-30T11:05:00.000Z	Kengine	space_cadet	so I can use it right ? or not ?
2009-04-30T11:06:00.000Z	space_cadet	Kengine	don't use anything but alchohal
2009-04-30T11:07:00.000Z	space_cadet	Kengine	alcohol is the only recommended thing to clean the residue off with because anything else can leave residue.
2009-04-30T11:07:00.000Z	Kengine	space_cadet	ohh ok
2009-04-30T11:07:00.000Z	space_cadet	Kengine	particularly, DO NOT use fingernail polish remover
