2007-11-06T03:10:00.000Z	nintendo64		I've tried 3 CD's already
2007-11-06T03:11:00.000Z	nintendo64		I can open it in explorer so it's fine
2007-11-06T03:11:00.000Z	nintendo64		wine i think
2007-11-06T03:11:00.000Z	nintendo64		or ist hat just for mac
2007-11-06T03:12:00.000Z	nintendo64		how do I check a disk's integrity then -.-
2007-11-06T03:13:00.000Z	nintendo64		what?
2007-11-06T03:14:00.000Z	nintendo64		ya I boot the CD and I select 'check CD for errors' and it freezes then too
2007-11-06T03:14:00.000Z	nintendo64		Maybe I'll just try makign another burn on a new disk -.-
2007-11-06T03:16:00.000Z	nintendo64		Would using a lower burn speed make it work better
2007-11-06T03:16:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	nintendo64	make what work better
2007-11-06T03:17:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	nintendo64	again what is on the cd.. burning things slowy anyway is better practice
2007-11-06T03:17:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	nintendo64	anything under 12x is good.. although I still burn much slower
2007-11-06T03:18:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	nintendo64	not a good thing
2007-11-06T03:59:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	nintendo64	acpi
2007-11-06T03:59:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	nintendo64	its disabled through ubuntu
2007-11-06T04:14:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	nintendo64	that would probably be a good idea... if its to hard for you to install then dont
2007-11-06T04:20:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	nintendo64	I really dont think linux is for you.. :)
