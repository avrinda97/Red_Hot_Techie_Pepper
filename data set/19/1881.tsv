2010-10-07T11:14:00.000Z	Jordan_U	antIP	That's a form of DRM. Use ddrescue to make an iso of the DVD then play that.
2010-10-07T11:16:00.000Z	antIP	Jordan_U	Oh, really? The Buffer I/O error on device sr0, logical block 2282330 is due to DRM? Because I played these same DVDs within the last couple of weeks on this same Linux box without a problem? Are you sure?
2010-10-07T11:18:00.000Z	Jordan_U	antIP	The fact that it played well before suggests it's not DRM that's causing the problem now. But yes, that message is consistent with DRM (Disk manufacturers add bogus checksums to simulate scratches on the disk).
2010-10-07T11:19:00.000Z	antIP	Jordan_U	In order to install ddrescue I have to uninstall a whole bunch of packages. Here they are: http://paste.ubuntu.com/507810/
2010-10-07T11:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U	antIP	If should have said before, even though the comand is "ddrescue" the package name is "gddrescue" (dd_rescue, the program installed by the ddrescue package, is a different program).
2010-10-07T11:23:00.000Z	antIP	Jordan_U	Hmmm. gddrescue still want's to uninstall those packes.
2010-10-07T11:24:00.000Z	Jordan_U	antIP	What happens if you just run "sudo apt-get upgrade"?
2010-10-07T11:25:00.000Z	antIP	Jordan_U	You might be right about the DRM. I was under the impression that these DVDs were played on this linux box within the last few weeks since I installed Ubuntu, BUT, I was just asking my wife if she was SURE and she said that she may have played them on our old windows installation (which is now long gone). Soooo....DRM may be the culprit. Except that we did play at least one of them on my Linux Mint laptop just fine.
2010-10-07T11:26:00.000Z	antIP	Jordan_U	Again, ISOs of other DVDs are playing fine. I don't know if that means anything though.
2010-10-07T11:31:00.000Z	antIP	Jordan_U	Maybe I should install 10.10 ;) It's almost ready to go, right?
2010-10-07T11:32:00.000Z	antIP	Jordan_U	PS> I'm doing that upgrade right now.
2010-10-07T11:47:00.000Z	Jordan_U	antIP	There are multiple forms of DRM, CSS is the original DRM using "encryption", and has been useless as a form of DRM for ages. This newer techneque of virtual scratches is still effective at stopping "unauthorized" programs such as mplayer/vlc but can be thwarted by standard data recovery tools like ddrescue.
2010-10-07T11:48:00.000Z	Jordan_U	antIP	It's somewhat ironic that you need to copy the DVD to bypass the copy protection preventing you from playing it directly :)
2010-10-07T11:52:00.000Z	antIP	Jordan_U	What I don't understand is why aptitude wants to remove several packages before installing gddrescue. All sorts of packages. Is there any other program I can use. I usually us k3b for ripping DVDs.
2010-10-07T11:53:00.000Z	Jordan_U	antIP	Then if you're getting IO errors there really is a problem with the disk / drive.
2010-10-07T11:54:00.000Z	Jordan_U	antIP	In which case ddrescue may still help, as recovery from damaged media is it's primary purpose.
2010-10-07T11:56:00.000Z	antIP	Jordan_U	You may be right, but other DVDs are playing fine.
2010-10-07T12:23:00.000Z	Jordan_U	antIP	You're welcome.
