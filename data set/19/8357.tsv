2007-05-14T13:36:00.000Z	Jonah		arrrgh i hate RAM, i've just spent a shed load of cash on it and now i don't know what to do
2007-05-14T13:36:00.000Z	Jonah		nothing works with 4x1gb ram dimms in
2007-05-14T13:37:00.000Z	Jonah		with 3 in the system boots but crashes a little into doing anything
2007-05-14T13:37:00.000Z	Jonah		and then some on the internet say it's not good to have 3 sticks in and faster to just have 2 sticks with less mem
2007-05-14T13:37:00.000Z	Jonah		i'm mad and don't know where to turn
2007-05-14T13:37:00.000Z	bbrazil	Jonah	sound like you have some bad ram
2007-05-14T13:38:00.000Z	Jonah	bbrazil	yeah i just dunno - is it not efficient to use three sticks as it goes into single channel mode?
2007-05-14T13:39:00.000Z	bbrazil	Jonah	what are you doing that's so memory intensive?
2007-05-14T13:41:00.000Z	Jonah	bbrazil	vmware
2007-05-14T13:41:00.000Z	bbrazil	Jonah	in that case you need all the memory you can get
2007-05-14T13:42:00.000Z	Jonah	bbrazil	even though some people seem to think that three sticks of more memory is worse than two sticks of less, somthing to do with flicking into single channel mode??
2007-05-14T13:42:00.000Z	bbrazil	Jonah	the difference is not likely to be noticable, if you're worried benchmark your app
2007-05-14T13:43:00.000Z	bbrazil	Jonah	discussion without data is pointless
2007-05-14T13:43:00.000Z	bbrazil	Jonah	if you really care about speed, you shouldn't use a virtual machine
2007-05-14T13:44:00.000Z	Jonah	bbrazil	so basically it' s not gonna be that noticeable really and is better to just have more ram?
2007-05-14T13:44:00.000Z	bbrazil	Jonah	in general, yes
2007-05-14T13:48:00.000Z	Jonah	bbrazil	ok i've tried booting with 3 sticks in but my system is ok for a bit then will just lock up, been swapping mem modules around to try isolate a bad one but can't seem to....
2007-05-14T13:48:00.000Z	bbrazil	Jonah	try one at a time and memtest86
2007-05-14T13:48:00.000Z	bbrazil	Jonah	should be a boot option, if not it's on the livecd
