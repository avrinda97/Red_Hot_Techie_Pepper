2007-04-09T05:43:00.000Z	ompaul	T0uCH	read web page, follow instructions, enjoy that is how it works
2007-04-09T05:43:00.000Z	ompaul	T0uCH	the reason for the gap in replies is I am not sitting at the computer - just passing by
2007-04-09T05:43:00.000Z	T0uCH	ompaul	i can't acces the fstab
2007-04-09T05:44:00.000Z	ompaul	T0uCH	what I did was give you a way to do the job, you are doing it your own way
2007-04-09T05:47:00.000Z	ompaul	T0uCH	laughing out loud at everything you do, does not encourge people to take you seriously:  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions

2007-04-09T05:58:00.000Z	T0uCH	ompaul	 it work for the c drive... but i got a d drive too... do i need to do something else?
2007-04-09T05:59:00.000Z	ompaul	T0uCH	add the same kind of data for that drive and make another directory for it - gksu gedit /etc/fstab for fun
2007-04-09T06:01:00.000Z	T0uCH	ompaul	 you meen like doing it another time..... but probably i will to change something on the files because it seem to be written for c drive
2007-04-09T06:05:00.000Z	T0uCH	ompaul	 it told me no other usable partitions found....
2007-04-09T06:05:00.000Z	ompaul	T0uCH	put the contents of the output of "sudo fdisk -l" in http://pastebin.ubuntu-nl.org
2007-04-09T06:11:00.000Z	T0uCH	ompaul	what is that site? is it a FAQ ? or kind of like
2007-04-09T06:12:00.000Z	ompaul	T0uCH	are you trolling me?
2007-04-09T06:14:00.000Z	T0uCH	ompaul	really not
2007-04-09T06:14:00.000Z	ompaul	T0uCH	so the question arrises where the use of a pastebin becomes a FAQ
