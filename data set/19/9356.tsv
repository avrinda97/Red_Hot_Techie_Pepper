2009-09-26T16:49:00.000Z	cheslyn		can someone tell me what is IRQ and OS and what does it do pls
2009-09-26T16:50:00.000Z	Slart	cheslyn	or.. not a physical item.. but a term
2009-09-26T16:50:00.000Z	Slart	cheslyn	IRQ is easiest explained by wikipedia.. it's a general computer hardware item...
2009-09-26T16:52:00.000Z	Slart	cheslyn	hmm.. I just read that article.. and it's very dry and technical.. basically it's a way for the cpu to be alerted when something wants attention.. so instead of the cpu asking the cd-rom, "are you done yet?" "are you done yet?"  and so on.. the cd-rom tells the cpu when it's done
2009-09-26T16:55:00.000Z	Slart	cheslyn	huh? what process?
2009-09-26T16:57:00.000Z	Slart	cheslyn	yes
2009-09-26T16:59:00.000Z	Slart	cheslyn	hmm.. what is a "fen" ?
2009-09-26T17:00:00.000Z	Slart	cheslyn	ahh.. fan.. sorry.. for a shorter while I would guess.. depends on a lot of other stuff.. cooling in the case and so on
2009-09-26T17:10:00.000Z	Slart	cheslyn	yes.. with a powerful enough computer that should be possible.. I'm not sure about how I would do it though..
2009-09-26T18:28:00.000Z	Slart	cheslyn	I don't think you can, not with the normal filesystem at least..
2009-09-26T18:29:00.000Z	Slart	cheslyn	I'm not entirely sure though.. there might be something clever out there
2009-09-26T18:31:00.000Z	Slart	cheslyn	you could encrypt it, change the permissions so noone but you can read the contents and so on
2009-09-26T18:33:00.000Z	Slart	cheslyn	possible, yes... easy to do and keep working through updates and so on, no
2009-09-26T18:35:00.000Z	Slart	cheslyn	no
2009-09-26T18:36:00.000Z	Slart	cheslyn	you're welcome
2009-09-26T18:38:00.000Z	Slart	cheslyn	administrative password? you mean your user password? (ie the one you log in with?)
2009-09-26T18:41:00.000Z	Slart	cheslyn	when do you use this password?
2009-09-26T18:53:00.000Z	Slart	cheslyn	that is the same password you use when you log in
2009-09-26T18:59:00.000Z	Slart	cheslyn	when you click on "Synaptic Package Manager" in System, Administration ?
