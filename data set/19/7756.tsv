2007-07-27T08:05:00.000Z	windio00		hmmm i think my router is going bad . . . . my theory is that it is the wan port only as the other ones work . . . any ideas for help?
2007-07-27T08:06:00.000Z	jetscreamer	windio00	i had one where the router worked, but the incoming internet connection port didn't.. brownout did it. linksys wrt54g
2007-07-27T08:06:00.000Z	windio00	jetscreamer	 mine is the gp2 from linksys
2007-07-27T08:07:00.000Z	jetscreamer		use hwinfo and set the v&h rates correctly in xorg.conf
2007-07-27T08:07:00.000Z	jetscreamer		!info hwinfo
2007-07-27T08:07:00.000Z	jetscreamer		hwinfo --monitor when x isn't running
2007-07-27T08:07:00.000Z	jetscreamer		now you do.. or will
2007-07-27T08:07:00.000Z	jetscreamer		i also find googling just the monitor's model # returns the v&h rates the most
2007-07-27T08:07:00.000Z	jetscreamer		when googling
2007-07-27T08:08:00.000Z	jetscreamer		ah
2007-07-27T08:08:00.000Z	windio00	jetscreamer	 did a ping from all computers connect to router . . . 100% . . . .and then 20% from computer to router just above this one
2007-07-27T08:08:00.000Z	jetscreamer		it did for me.. make sure xorg/gedm isn't running
2007-07-27T08:08:00.000Z	jetscreamer		gdm
2007-07-27T08:08:00.000Z	jetscreamer		/etc/init.d/gdm stop
2007-07-27T08:08:00.000Z	jetscreamer		if you use gnome/gdm
2007-07-27T08:08:00.000Z	jetscreamer		kdm for kde
2007-07-27T08:08:00.000Z	windio00	jetscreamer	 then i pinged the one above directly from ubuntu
2007-07-27T08:08:00.000Z	jetscreamer		apt-get install hwinfo first
2007-07-27T08:08:00.000Z	windio00	jetscreamer	100%
