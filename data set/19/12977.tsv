2005-06-03T05:02:00.000Z	prasad	xoz	but why my bios and ubuntu time are different ?
2005-06-03T05:03:00.000Z	xoz	prasad	maybe it is running ntpupdate?
2005-06-03T05:04:00.000Z	prasad	xoz	yes ntpdate is running
2005-06-03T05:04:00.000Z	prasad	xoz	how todisable?
2005-06-03T05:04:00.000Z	xoz	prasad	which means that the system is sync to a time server. during shutdown, your bios will be updated
2005-06-03T05:05:00.000Z	xoz	prasad	disable /etc/init.d/ntpdate
2005-06-03T05:06:00.000Z	prasad	xoz	will /etc/init.d/ntpdate stop solve ?
2005-06-03T05:06:00.000Z	xoz	prasad	i think your question is confusing
2005-06-03T05:06:00.000Z	xoz	prasad	you meant maybe timezone problem.. not the real time problem
2005-06-03T05:07:00.000Z	prasad	xoz	time problem
2005-06-03T05:07:00.000Z	xoz	prasad	possible also that when you boot to window, it uses utc or not uses utc while linux is using the opposite.
2005-06-03T05:08:00.000Z	prasad	xoz	no windows on my machine
2005-06-03T05:08:00.000Z	prasad	xoz	i have only hoary and fc3
2005-06-03T05:10:00.000Z	xoz	prasad	make sure that both system agrees in setting utc or disabling it.
