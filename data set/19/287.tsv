2012-05-05T23:28:00.000Z	brightsparks		Hi. I'm trying to play a commercial DVD but the system is refusing to play it. It does play other dvd's though but for some reason it's refusing to play this one. Need help. Thanks.
2012-05-05T23:29:00.000Z	brightsparks		ubottu:: hi ok thanks. I'm heading off there now. THanks again.
2012-05-05T23:30:00.000Z	escott	brightsparks	if you have already properly installed decss then its probably just region locked
2012-05-05T23:30:00.000Z	brightsparks	escott	no. I borrowed it from my local lilbrary!
2012-05-05T23:31:00.000Z	brightsparks	escott	anyway I'll try what the  ubottu suggested first.
2012-05-05T23:32:00.000Z	brightsparks	escott	what is the decss?
2012-05-05T23:33:00.000Z	escott	brightsparks	the routine to decrypt the css on dvd's. its what you are instructed to install in the !dvd factoid
2012-05-05T23:33:00.000Z	brightsparks	escott	ok em so how do I know if I have it installed or not?
2012-05-05T23:34:00.000Z	escott	brightsparks	did you follow the instructions in !dvd to run the install-css.sh script?
2012-05-05T23:35:00.000Z	brightsparks	escott	I don't what you're referrring to - I'm just reading now the ubuntu dot com page about restricted formats...

2012-09-22T23:53:00.000Z	escott	brightsparks	is open source and pgp compatible. general purpose file encryption tool
2012-09-22T23:54:00.000Z	brightsparks	escott	ok thanks
2012-10-06T03:28:00.000Z	escott	brightsparks	you can convert ext3 to ext4 very easily, but you would have to copy any larger files to benefit from the ext4 features
2012-10-06T03:28:00.000Z	brightsparks	escott	tell me more!
2012-10-06T03:29:00.000Z	escott	brightsparks	the main feature of ext4 is extents (more efficient storage of large files). by copying files to new locations you can force the allocation of extents for the larger files
2012-10-06T03:33:00.000Z	brightsparks	escott	you couldn't refer me to a website that would explain what you said in more detail could you?

2012-10-06T03:34:00.000Z	brightsparks	escott	great. Thanks v much
