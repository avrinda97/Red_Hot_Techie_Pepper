2009-06-22T18:43:00.000Z	mbeichorn	bob_rock	what does the error say
2009-06-22T18:43:00.000Z	bob_rock	mbeichorn	i have shared both computer but when I click share folder in my network, it always unable to mount drive or something like that
2009-06-22T18:44:00.000Z	mbeichorn	bob_rock	it might be a permissions thing
2009-06-22T18:44:00.000Z	bob_rock	mbeichorn	how i could solve that
2009-06-22T18:45:00.000Z	mbeichorn		if so chmod 777
2009-06-22T18:45:00.000Z	mbeichorn		then the location of the mount point
2009-06-22T18:45:00.000Z	mbeichorn		ie "chmod 777 /media/sdb"
2009-06-22T18:46:00.000Z	bob_rock	mbeichorn	/media/D
2009-06-22T18:47:00.000Z	bob_rock		mbeichorn?
2009-06-22T18:48:00.000Z	mbeichorn	bob_rock	if the mountpoint is /media/D try the terminal command "sudo chmod 777 /media/D"
2009-06-22T18:49:00.000Z	bob_rock	mbeichorn	ok i'll try it, thanks alot.
2009-06-22T18:50:00.000Z	mbeichorn	bob_rock	hardware changes such as undocking before unmounting will prevent remouting until reboot
2009-06-22T18:51:00.000Z	bob_rock	mbeichorn	is the command permanent or not (sudo chmod 777 /media/D)?
2009-06-22T18:52:00.000Z	mbeichorn	bob_rock	yes it will stay until the drive in question is reformatted or renamed
2009-06-22T18:53:00.000Z	bob_rock	mbeichorn	sory, i'm in internet cafe so I can't practice it, so I have to be sure about the way out
