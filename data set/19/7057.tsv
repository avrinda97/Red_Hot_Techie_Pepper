2007-10-19T08:37:00.000Z	magicrobotmonkey	Flyzoola	sudo allows you toto run a command as the admin user
2007-10-19T08:38:00.000Z	magicrobotmonkey	Flyzoola	so using sudo vi /etc/.. is a good way to remind you to be careful and it prevents applications you run as a normal user from messing around in there
2007-10-19T08:40:00.000Z	Flyzoola	magicrobotmonkey	so I should just type in sudo vi /etc/icecast2 on the terminal?
2007-10-19T08:40:00.000Z	magicrobotmonkey	Flyzoola	try gksudo gedit /etc/../file

2007-10-19T08:43:00.000Z	magicrobotmonkey	Flyzoola	did it prompt you for a passwork?
2007-10-19T08:43:00.000Z	magicrobotmonkey	Flyzoola	er, pasword
2007-10-19T08:44:00.000Z	magicrobotmonkey	Flyzoola	did you use gksudo or just sudo?
2007-10-19T08:44:00.000Z	Flyzoola	magicrobotmonkey	haha I've been trying to get this damn internet radio station working for the past 5 hours. I typed gksudo
2007-10-19T08:45:00.000Z	magicrobotmonkey	Flyzoola	you know how to use vi?
2007-10-19T08:45:00.000Z	Flyzoola	magicrobotmonkey	nope. like I said, this is my 3rd day on any linux based OS.
2007-10-19T08:46:00.000Z	magicrobotmonkey	Flyzoola	ok, try sudo nano /etc/icecast2
2007-10-19T08:46:00.000Z	Flyzoola	magicrobotmonkey	the terminal changed all weird. what is it?
2007-10-19T08:47:00.000Z	magicrobotmonkey	Flyzoola	erm, perhaps thats not a text file, what directions are you trying to follow?
2007-10-19T08:53:00.000Z	magicrobotmonkey	Flyzoola	icecast is probably your best bet, you're going to have to figure out the configuration for *Any* of them
2007-10-19T08:54:00.000Z	magicrobotmonkey	Flyzoola	did you check ubuntuforums?
