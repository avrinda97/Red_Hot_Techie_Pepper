2006-08-06T13:27:00.000Z	DanaG		argh, my sound stopped working.
2006-08-06T13:29:00.000Z	DanaG		My onboard HD Audio needed some position_fix setting, but I can't find it.
2006-08-06T13:30:00.000Z	DanaG		I can't find how to unload and reload the snd_hda_intel module.
2006-08-06T13:31:00.000Z	DanaG		It's in use.
2006-08-06T13:32:00.000Z	holycow	DanaG	*hmmm* thats outside my knowledge
2006-08-06T13:32:00.000Z	holycow	DanaG	if its a driver for hard drivers you wont be able unload it as the os is probably mounted off of it
2006-08-06T13:49:00.000Z	holycow	DanaG	it doesn't except for kernel updates.  of course ifyou don't know what you are doing, sure a reboot is a shortcut
2006-08-06T13:51:00.000Z	holycow	DanaG	what Jowi said.  generally any change to a process requires the restart of that process it self.  in some cases a logout/login is required indeed
2006-11-27T12:52:00.000Z	holycow	DanaG	i'm going to take a wild stab at this and suggest your keyboard is busted
2006-11-27T12:52:00.000Z	holycow	DanaG	your explanation in understand but i cannot see how it could result in such errors
2006-11-27T12:53:00.000Z	holycow	DanaG	you have definitavely ruled out your keyboard?
2006-11-27T12:53:00.000Z	holycow	DanaG	well yes it does autocomplete, you just hit enter and done
2006-11-27T12:54:00.000Z	holycow	DanaG	its not highlighting the prompt/suggestion?
2006-11-27T12:55:00.000Z	holycow	DanaG	but its supposed to do that?
2006-11-27T12:56:00.000Z	holycow	DanaG	have you looked for gnome settings via gconf editor to turn this off?
2006-11-27T12:59:00.000Z	holycow	DanaG	that might be better indeed
2006-11-27T12:59:00.000Z	holycow	DanaG	sorry we couldn't help you
2007-04-20T16:36:00.000Z	holycow	DanaG	not yet, but just download their .tar.gz and extract and double click on their binary
2007-04-20T16:36:00.000Z	holycow	DanaG	it runs just like that no need to install until you get a deb packaged for you
