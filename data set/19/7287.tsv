2007-09-20T08:19:00.000Z	Fluffy-Wuffy		im trying to compile a program for the first time since i cant find it anywhere in a synaptic compatible package and i really need it, i got my terminal to say "myaccountname@computername: ~/Desktop/ProgramName-0.1$" but the "less install" or "./configure" commands wont work, what am i doing wrong?
2007-09-20T08:20:00.000Z	Fluffy-Wuffy		MoBlock-0.8
2007-09-20T08:20:00.000Z	Fluffy-Wuffy		i thought sudo apt-get was only for programs listed in synaptic or add & remove prorams?
2007-09-20T08:20:00.000Z	Fluffy-Wuffy		"bash:  ./configure:  No such file or directory"
2007-09-20T08:21:00.000Z	Scunizi	Fluffy-Wuffy	there are deb available here.. http://moblock-deb.sourceforge.net/
2007-09-20T08:25:00.000Z	Scunizi	Fluffy-Wuffy	you've got 3 lines for the res you want.  I would comment out 2 of the three and restart gdm.  If that doesn't work switch to the next one.. then the next.
2007-09-20T08:26:00.000Z	Scunizi	Fluffy-Wuffy	sorry .. were you wanting someone to look at your xorg in pastebin or did I get the nick wrong?
2007-09-20T08:28:00.000Z	Scunizi	Fluffy-Wuffy	did you see my post for the deb for that program? You can find it here..http://moblock-deb.sourceforge.net/
2007-09-20T08:30:00.000Z	Scunizi	Fluffy-Wuffy	is there a reason to compile it instead of installing the deb?
2007-09-20T08:31:00.000Z	Scunizi	Fluffy-Wuffy	I hope it works for you.. I used the Linux portion of google to find it by going to www.google.com/linux... very helpful
2007-09-20T08:35:00.000Z	Scunizi	Fluffy-Wuffy	no problem..
2007-09-20T08:41:00.000Z	Fluffy-Wuffy	Scunizi	where do i add the sources for moblock in my sources.list file?
2007-09-20T08:42:00.000Z	Scunizi	Fluffy-Wuffy	hang on I'll look on my machine.
