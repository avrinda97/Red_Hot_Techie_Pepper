2009-06-08T21:18:00.000Z	drewby		 Hi everyone, I'm running firefox 3.0.10 for Ubuntu 9.04, when I try to load my webpage in firefox, I get 'failed to load xpcom component' in the error console and none of the javascript runs. WTF is up?
2009-06-08T21:19:00.000Z	becomingGuru	drewby	Just remove and reinstall firefox.. simple
2009-06-08T21:19:00.000Z	drewby	becomingGuru	I tried that, didn't work
2009-06-08T21:19:00.000Z	drewby	becomingGuru	I even tried marking all firefox related packages for complete removal and reinstalling
2009-06-08T21:19:00.000Z	becomingGuru	drewby	The bundled version is 3.0.10
2009-06-08T21:20:00.000Z	drewby	becomingGuru	that's what I'm running, it had never given me this problem before today
2009-06-08T21:20:00.000Z	drewby	becomingGuru	now I can't get rid of it
2009-06-08T21:20:00.000Z	becomingGuru	drewby	BTW, in the mean while, while firefox acts as a bitch, use Chrome, works for me like a charm
2009-06-08T21:21:00.000Z	becomingGuru	drewby	When U said, I removed all packages related to FF, where all from did u remove...
2009-06-08T21:21:00.000Z	drewby	becomingGuru	I need firefox to run because I have to make sure my code supports it
2009-06-08T21:22:00.000Z	drewby	becomingGuru	I just used synaptic, removed firefox ubufox xulrunner etc...
2009-06-08T21:22:00.000Z	becomingGuru	drewby	No. That doesnt remove your personal ~/.firefox which by my experience is the sole reson for all the problem
2009-06-08T21:23:00.000Z	becomingGuru	drewby	Just start by renaming it to something else so that ff doesnt get your personalization stuff
2009-06-08T21:24:00.000Z	becomingGuru	drewby	As grawity and kbrosnan suggest it is perhaps ~/.mozilla
2009-06-08T21:27:00.000Z	drewby	becomingGuru	yep, that seemed to fix it, sucks that i had to lose all my bookmarks though
2009-06-08T21:28:00.000Z	becomingGuru	drewby	No U dont hv to loose bookmarks... I think U can choose and pick the folder U want from that .mozilla
2009-06-08T21:29:00.000Z	becomingGuru	drewby	I am sure some one small file would hv caused the problem
2009-06-08T21:29:00.000Z	drewby	becomingGuru	well it's done now
2009-06-08T21:30:00.000Z	drewby	becomingGuru	it's okay though, they were all their for speed rather than for memory, I'm sure I'll be able to find the mozilla dom reference the msdn dom reference w3schools and all the other places I had bookmarked again
