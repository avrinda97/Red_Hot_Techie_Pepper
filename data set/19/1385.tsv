2011-02-05T11:23:00.000Z	bazhang	xgt001	then be patient
2011-02-05T11:23:00.000Z	bazhang	xgt001	its offtopic here
2011-06-14T17:17:00.000Z	bazhang	xgt001	what do you need it for
2011-06-14T17:18:00.000Z	xgt001	bazhang	to save my battery power, the kernel 2.6.37 doesn't have the power regression, https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/760131
2011-06-19T11:54:00.000Z	bazhang	xgt001	why not just upgrade 10.10 to 11.04
2011-06-19T11:55:00.000Z	xgt001	bazhang	11.04 runs a lot noisy, in laptops with reduced battery i had  tried before (a known launchpad bug #760131)... so i want a triple boot
2011-06-19T12:00:00.000Z	bazhang	xgt001	with what? fixing grub?
2012-02-11T11:59:00.000Z	bazhang	xgt001	good question, there is more than likely to be a PPA before a backport
2012-02-11T11:59:00.000Z	xgt001	bazhang	so right now there are no ppa's to i guess? coz the unity-staging ppa wont work in oneiric
2012-02-11T12:00:00.000Z	bazhang	xgt001	I dont directly know of one, just pointing that out
2012-02-18T20:01:00.000Z	bazhang	xgt001	what is mplayer-vaapi
2012-02-18T20:03:00.000Z	xgt001	bazhang	it is a custom build of mplayer to get hardware acclerated video working on amd card based systems,
2012-02-18T20:03:00.000Z	bazhang	xgt001	installed from where?
2012-02-18T20:04:00.000Z	xgt001	bazhang	not installed its built from the splitted-desktop website source,
