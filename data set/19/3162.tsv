2009-10-23T08:34:00.000Z	johntron		who here uses virtualization on their ubuntu server?
2009-10-23T08:35:00.000Z	johntron		cwillu_clone: do you use kvm or something else?
2009-10-23T08:35:00.000Z	cwillu_clone	johntron	kvm and qemu on different machines
2009-10-23T08:35:00.000Z	johntron	cwillu_clone	so you have a xeon or an opteron?
2009-10-23T08:36:00.000Z	cwillu_clone	johntron	also have used virtualbox for one instance where I needed a working usb passthrough and didn't have the patience to figure it out
2009-10-23T08:36:00.000Z	johntron	cwillu_clone	ok. well i don't have one of those, and i don't think i'm going to fork out the cash for one, but i'm curious. how hard was it to setup?
2009-10-23T08:37:00.000Z	cwillu_clone	johntron	pretty simple;  libvirt + virt-manager makes it quite simple
2009-10-23T08:38:00.000Z	johntron	cwillu_clone	ok thanks. do you know if there is any way to run kvm on a processor that doesn't support virtualization (i guess you'd call it emulation)? intel xeon/itanium and amd opterons seem to be the only ones with hardware support
2009-10-23T08:39:00.000Z	cwillu_clone	johntron	you'd use qemu or something equivilent
2009-10-23T08:39:00.000Z	johntron	cwillu_clone	i think that's what the OLPC folks use
2009-10-23T08:39:00.000Z	cwillu_clone	johntron	or in some cases you could use something like user-mode linux as a pseudo virtualization
2009-10-23T08:39:00.000Z	johntron	cwillu_clone	hmm
2009-10-23T08:40:00.000Z	johntron	cwillu_clone	ok, thanks a lot!
2009-10-23T08:41:00.000Z	cwillu_clone	johntron	take a look at cgroups
2009-10-23T08:42:00.000Z	cwillu_clone	johntron	actually, you're looking at networking load-balancing, nvm :p
2009-10-23T08:42:00.000Z	cwillu_clone	johntron	I know there's a usermode app that can do it, and I think you could also do it with firewall rules, it's just a not a problem I've had to try hard to deal with
2009-10-23T08:44:00.000Z	johntron	cwillu_clone	yeah, the ufw is just a wrapper for iptables. ufw doesn't do anything as far as load balancing. it can be done in iptables, but it's really really gross
2009-10-23T08:44:00.000Z	cwillu_clone	johntron	it'll put hair on your chest :p
2009-10-23T08:45:00.000Z	johntron	cwillu_clone	hah, that's for sure. i don't need anymore of that
