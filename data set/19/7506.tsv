2007-12-01T06:12:00.000Z	scguy318	user1	what's the problem?
2007-12-01T06:12:00.000Z	scguy318	user1	if you run VLC from the terminal, can you pastebin the error messages at the terminal prompt?
2007-12-01T06:12:00.000Z	scguy318	user1	or perhaps an excerpt of the messages that VLC produces
2007-12-01T06:13:00.000Z	scguy318	user1	you need to enable the Medibuntu repo
2007-12-01T06:13:00.000Z	scguy318	user1	and install libdvdcss2, that cannot be distributed legally in some jurisdictions
2007-12-01T06:14:00.000Z	user1	scguy318	it is fine besides proud US of A and afair Franch?
2007-12-01T06:14:00.000Z	scguy318	user1	?
2007-12-01T06:15:00.000Z	user1	scguy318	wonder is it ok here
2007-12-01T06:15:00.000Z	scguy318	user1	possibly, ask a lawyer, but I'm sure it'll be fine, I doubt the MAFIAA will be kicking in doors to find copies of libdvdcss2
