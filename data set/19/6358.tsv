2008-02-03T03:34:00.000Z	gmcastil		is there an easy way to view the contents of an installed package from the CLI?
2008-02-03T03:35:00.000Z	crimsun	gmcastil	dpkg -L package.
2008-02-03T03:35:00.000Z	gmcastil	crimsun	how is that different from dpkg -c package?
2008-02-03T03:35:00.000Z	crimsun	gmcastil	-c -> provided deb file.  -L -> installed package.
2008-02-03T03:36:00.000Z	gmcastil	crimsun	the man pages for apt aren't very descriptive
2008-02-03T03:36:00.000Z	crimsun	gmcastil	meaning for dpkg?
2008-02-03T03:36:00.000Z	gmcastil	crimsun	yeah...pkg mgmt in general - i'm really missing RPM at this point
2008-02-03T03:36:00.000Z	gmcastil	crimsun	i've spent most of the past day or so trying to figure out how to see what packages are installed and which aren't, etc
2008-02-03T03:37:00.000Z	crimsun	gmcastil	I think, from dpkg(1), that "-L, --listfiles package-name...  List files installed to your system from package-name" is fairly descriptive.
2008-02-03T03:38:00.000Z	gmcastil	crimsun	as oppose to "list contents of a deb package"
2008-02-03T03:38:00.000Z	crimsun	gmcastil	yes.  Feel free to file a bug and attach a patch to rectify the purported ambiguity.
2008-02-03T03:38:00.000Z	gmcastil	crimsun	at this point, i'm pretty frustrated with the whole apt system...sorry for whining
2008-02-03T03:39:00.000Z	crimsun	gmcastil	I presume you've discovered by now that `dpkg -l` will return which binary packages are installed?
2008-02-03T03:40:00.000Z	gmcastil	crimsun	i think so...i'm starting to think that dpkg is the correct way to interact with the apt db, rather than apt-cache
2008-02-03T03:40:00.000Z	gmcastil	crimsun	that sound right?
2008-02-03T03:40:00.000Z	crimsun	gmcastil	depends on the goal, I think.  apt-cache exposes "meta", like dependencies and such between packages (handled by dpkg).
2008-02-03T03:41:00.000Z	crimsun	gmcastil	an analogy could be yum vice rpm.
2008-02-03T03:41:00.000Z	gmcastil	crimsun	yeah...exactly what i'd been thinking
2008-02-03T03:45:00.000Z	gmcastil	crimsun	dpkg -l is a lot better than what i was doing...i was doing apt-cache pkgnames
