2008-05-10T20:38:00.000Z	omer		hey folks,i wanna to get higher than 640x480 resolution in ubuntu 8.04
2008-05-10T20:39:00.000Z	amirman84	omer	have you enabled third party software souces?
2008-05-10T20:39:00.000Z	omer	amirman84	no
2008-05-10T20:40:00.000Z	amirman84	omer	go to system > administration > software sources and check off the two checkboxes under the third party tab, then check off the checkboxes beside proposed and backports under the next tab
2008-05-10T20:41:00.000Z	omer	amirman84	ok, next
2008-05-10T20:41:00.000Z	amirman84	omer	then it'll automatically update your repositories, and shortly after it should automatically find a video driver for you to download
2008-05-10T20:42:00.000Z	amirman84	omer	if it doesnt automatically pop up within a minute or two then go to system>administration>hardware drivers and look for your video card driver in there
2008-05-10T20:42:00.000Z	omer	amirman84	ok, i am looking
2008-05-10T20:43:00.000Z	omer	amirman84	my graphic card already installed but the highest resolution is 640x480
2008-05-10T20:45:00.000Z	omer	amirman84	system>administration>hardware drivers  from here i enabled my card but still the highest res. is 640x480
2008-05-10T20:45:00.000Z	amirman84	omer	after you enable the driver you should reboot your machine
2008-05-10T20:45:00.000Z	amirman84	omer	installing the drivers is one of the few times you'll ever need to reboot ubuntu
2008-05-10T20:46:00.000Z	omer	amirman84	i know ,i had rebooted machine before i join this channel
2008-05-10T20:47:00.000Z	amirman84	omer	have you rebooted since enabling the driver?
2008-05-10T20:47:00.000Z	omer	amirman84	yes
2008-05-10T20:48:00.000Z	amirman84	omer	you will want to find out about the xorg.conf file and how you can manually put your setting in there. when your driver is enabled but your resolution is still limited, its usually because of the xorg.conf file
2008-05-10T20:49:00.000Z	omer	amirman84	yes, you are right, how can make that
2008-05-10T20:51:00.000Z	amirman84	omer	when i had a similar problem i went to #compiz and someone in there was nice enough to look at my xorg.conf file and rewrite one for me, I don't really know much about it except that you can manually put all your graphics info in there to tell X how to use your graphics driver, i would recommend googling your graphics card and xorg.conf to see what others have done
2008-05-10T20:52:00.000Z	omer	amirman84	ok,thank you
