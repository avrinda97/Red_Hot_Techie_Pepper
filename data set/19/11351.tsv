2006-02-20T10:41:00.000Z	vwguy337	ulrik	mac hardware
2006-02-20T10:42:00.000Z	vwguy337	ulrik	ok...do you know if breezy will work on the new MacBook with the Intel chipsets?
2006-02-20T10:43:00.000Z	ulrik	vwguy337	no linux will work on them so far, they use EFI, not Open Firmware or BIOS
2006-02-20T10:44:00.000Z	vwguy337	ulrik	damn...guess i'm not buying a macbook then
2006-02-20T10:44:00.000Z	ulrik	vwguy337	in short, the firmware is a new kind that neither linux nor windows is adapted to yet
2006-02-20T10:44:00.000Z	ulrik	vwguy337	Red Hat is working on it though
2006-02-20T10:44:00.000Z	vwguy337	ulrik	i've not been able to get a redhat disty to work on anything so far...LOL
2006-02-20T10:45:00.000Z	vwguy337	ulrik	now...if i could only get my damn wireless working on this laptop, i could blow away winblows...lol
2006-02-20T10:45:00.000Z	ulrik	vwguy337	yep, that's the case for many of us. I still don't have wireless working on mine.. though I need to try even harder
2006-02-20T10:46:00.000Z	vwguy337	ulrik	it's a matter of time for me...i have the files downloaded from the acx111.sf.net page...just don't have time to hack them into the system...lol
2006-02-20T10:47:00.000Z	vwguy337	ulrik	thanks for the info!  =] 
2006-02-20T10:48:00.000Z	ulrik	vwguy337	no problem
2006-02-20T11:00:00.000Z	vwguy337	ulrik	quick question...you mentioned redhat on the new macbook...is that actually redhat or fedora?
2006-02-20T11:01:00.000Z	ulrik	vwguy337	I have no Idea... it should go into both.. and then into every distro around
2006-02-20T11:01:00.000Z	ulrik	vwguy337	I have no Idea... it should go into both.. and then into every distro around
2006-02-20T11:02:00.000Z	vwguy337	ulrik	k...thanks...i'm still seeing PPC only on the fedora site...  =[
2006-02-20T11:02:00.000Z	ulrik	vwguy337	absolutely, it will take quite long time... my guess is a year... I mean there aren't many of these machines to work on yet
2006-02-20T11:03:00.000Z	vwguy337	ulrik	tja...verdammt...lol
