2008-01-12T19:19:00.000Z	erawfish	th0r	it doesn't need a manual route if the IP is set up right since the damn thing is int he same subnet
2008-01-12T19:20:00.000Z	th0r	erawfish	first...no need to be an ass. Second...it doesn't ping so it was a quick check
2008-01-13T05:10:00.000Z	erawfish	th0r	it's not the menu.lst that is wrong. it's the way you installed grub. grub can't find one of its files
2008-01-13T05:11:00.000Z	th0r	erawfish	addressed that line to the wrong person <smile>
2008-01-13T19:02:00.000Z	th0r	erawfish	yeah...if you know how to determine the uid it is a better choice
2008-01-13T19:04:00.000Z	th0r	erawfish	I learn the neatest stuff when you show up <smile>
2008-01-16T09:28:00.000Z	erawfish	th0r	what won't purge apache2 at all. apache2 is a metapackage
2008-01-16T09:29:00.000Z	th0r	erawfish	ok....how can he kill apache2 and the configs for it?
2008-01-16T09:30:00.000Z	th0r	erawfish	Chamunks apt-get can handle the metapackage right?
2008-01-16T09:30:00.000Z	erawfish	th0r	it won't
2008-01-16T09:31:00.000Z	th0r	erawfish	well, he says it doesn't show in synaptic....how does he go about removing it?
2008-01-16T09:31:00.000Z	erawfish	th0r	dpkg -l |grep apache to first check if and what is installed
2008-01-16T09:31:00.000Z	th0r	erawfish	ok...I had the package wrong <smile>. I should get a point for being close
2008-01-16T09:32:00.000Z	erawfish	th0r	"close" doesn't cut it for apt-get I'm afraid
2008-01-16T09:33:00.000Z	erawfish	th0r	if grub can't find itself you will have to reinstall it wherever you installed it
2008-01-16T09:33:00.000Z	th0r	erawfish	grub is for someone else <smile>
2008-01-16T09:44:00.000Z	th0r	erawfish	 but if you don't remove worker doesn't it stay in the db? It will show as installed even though there is nothing there?
2008-01-17T00:51:00.000Z	th0r	erawfish	you going to follow up on that or should I go ahead?
2008-01-17T00:51:00.000Z	erawfish	th0r	go ahead
