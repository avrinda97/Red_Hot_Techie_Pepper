2011-07-04T04:33:00.000Z	Zzzzz		i want manually edit to /etc/shadow for changing password of root and any other user, how can i do this ?
2011-07-04T04:34:00.000Z	Zzzzz		can i create that hash value and edit to shadow file?
2011-07-04T04:35:00.000Z	Zzzzz		can i use any tool for making md5 hash or whatevery shadow file use i am on ubuntu 10.10 so
2011-07-04T04:35:00.000Z	pfifo	Zzzzz	yes
2011-07-04T04:36:00.000Z	pfifo	Zzzzz	no
2011-07-04T04:36:00.000Z	Zzzzz	pfifo	md5sum ?
2011-07-04T04:37:00.000Z	pfifo	Zzzzz	/etc/shadow uses DES, specifically the crypt() function
2011-07-04T04:37:00.000Z	Zzzzz	pfifo	then what should i do ?
2011-07-04T04:38:00.000Z	pfifo	Zzzzz	I would write my own program that uses crypt()... I dont know a ready made tool for this, possibly 'passwd'
2011-07-04T04:39:00.000Z	Zzzzz	pfifo	if i will go in another ubuntu 10.10 and then type passwd username and then go in that diff shadow file and then copy it and paste in that another shadow file will it work ?
2011-07-04T04:39:00.000Z	pfifo	Zzzzz	i dont know
2011-07-04T04:40:00.000Z	Zzzzz	pfifo	did you make your own tool for this task ? making encrypted ?
2011-07-04T04:40:00.000Z	pfifo	Zzzzz	what is the real goal here? normally you use passwd to set passwords, why dosent this work for you?
2011-07-04T04:49:00.000Z	Zzzzz	pfifo	and guvnor: yes it work if we create user in another ubuntu and then just copy/paste its encrypted pass into another shadow file then it works as well..
2011-07-04T04:51:00.000Z	pfifo	Zzzzz	you still havent explained why your doing it manually, theres an easier way for sure
2011-07-04T04:54:00.000Z	Zzzzz	pfifo	i had two ubuntu 10.10 , which roots and normal user's password were forgotten, now i cant recover pass fro startup recovery mode, if lilo were installed still it was getting any key, i had ony kvm, i had run ubunt live cd and then create user with pass and went in shadow file of that live cd os and then paste in my geniune server's shadow file and paste it there and on reboot it start working
2011-07-04T04:55:00.000Z	pfifo	Zzzzz	boot a livecd and then mount the root filesystem, then chroot into the filesystem and run passwd
