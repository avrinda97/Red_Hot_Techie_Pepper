2009-10-08T20:44:00.000Z	mquin	Join-D	what does '/set user_name' give you?
2009-10-08T20:36:00.000Z	mquin	Join-D	which nick are you trying to connect using?
2009-10-08T20:37:00.000Z	Join-D	mquin	i think i havent set one yet
2009-10-08T20:37:00.000Z	Join-D	mquin	i just installed irssi
2009-10-08T20:38:00.000Z	mquin	Join-D	do '/set nick' and look for 'nick =' in the status window
2009-10-08T20:38:00.000Z	Join-D	mquin	ok that worked..  i am now trying to reconnect
2009-10-08T20:40:00.000Z	Join-D	mquin	next error is !chat.freenode.net *** No identd (auth) response
2009-10-08T20:40:00.000Z	mquin	Join-D	you can ignore the identd message - it's not important

2009-10-08T20:41:00.000Z	mquin	Join-D	are you getting an error message when it is closed?
