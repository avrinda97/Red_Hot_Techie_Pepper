2010-11-07T21:17:00.000Z	sejer		Hello all.
2010-11-07T21:18:00.000Z	sejer		I hope someone can help me
2010-11-07T21:18:00.000Z	sejer		Today flash is not working on my 10.10 x64 machine
2010-11-07T21:18:00.000Z	sejer		not working in chrome or FF
2010-11-07T21:19:00.000Z	duffydack	sejer	updated it?
2010-11-07T21:19:00.000Z	sejer		All I can think of is that I ran some updates last night
2010-11-07T21:19:00.000Z	duffydack	sejer	32bit or 64bit alpha flash?
2010-11-07T21:19:00.000Z	sejer		But I am a Linux novice and so do not know how to roll back
2010-11-07T21:19:00.000Z	sejer		Well, the OS is x64
2010-11-07T21:20:00.000Z	duffydack	sejer	I'll assume its 32bit flash since you need to install 64bit version yourself or with a ppa
2010-11-07T21:21:00.000Z	sejer		OK daffy, I see what you mean, I have donloaded the 64bit file from Adobe Labs but not done anything with it yet.
2010-11-07T21:21:00.000Z	duffydack	sejer	32bit works ok here.  remove it, reinstall it ? or use the 64bit.
2010-11-07T21:21:00.000Z	duffydack	sejer	there is a ppa if you want it easy
2010-11-07T21:21:00.000Z	sejer		I searched for libflashplugin.so and the only file was in my Boxee folder
2010-11-07T21:22:00.000Z	duffydack	sejer	that doesnt help then..
2010-11-07T21:22:00.000Z	sejer		OK duffydack, so I go into Ubuntu software centre and remove, reinstall?
2010-11-07T21:22:00.000Z	duffydack	sejer	sudo apt-get install --reinstall flashplugin-installer
2010-11-07T21:23:00.000Z	sejer		Thanks duffy, trying it now
2010-11-07T21:26:00.000Z	sejer	duffydack	you're a superstar. Thanks very much for your help
