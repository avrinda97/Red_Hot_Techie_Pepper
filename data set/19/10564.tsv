2006-12-29T09:45:00.000Z	psycode		for some reason i have no internet access from my ubuntu machine. i get an ip from the router, but that's about it. can someone help me with that? (im a windows user usually) - how can i for example check my defauly gateway settings?
2006-12-29T09:47:00.000Z	stefg	psycode	DNS trouble?
2006-12-29T09:47:00.000Z	psycode		stef, nope, i tried google.com's ip.
2006-12-29T09:47:00.000Z	psycode	stefg	that was for you^
2006-12-29T09:47:00.000Z	stefg		got it... still chewing on it
2006-12-29T09:48:00.000Z	psycode	stefg	how can i check my default gateway?
2006-12-29T09:48:00.000Z	stefg		cat /etc/network/interfaces
2006-12-29T09:49:00.000Z	psycode	stefg	yup that's incorrect:) how can i change the default gateway?
2006-12-29T09:49:00.000Z	stefg		Psycode just edit the file with root privilegs and save it
2006-12-29T09:50:00.000Z	psycode	stefg	anything i need to do for changes to take affect?
2006-12-29T09:51:00.000Z	stefg	psycode	sudo ifdown eth*, sudo ifup eth*
2006-12-29T09:51:00.000Z	stefg		or whatever your NIC is called
2006-12-29T09:52:00.000Z	psycode	stefg	doesn't help :( is there a different way to check my current gateway? (not the config file itself)
2006-12-29T09:52:00.000Z	stefg	psycode	there's a GUI-applet for it in System-Admin-Network
2006-12-29T09:53:00.000Z	psycode	stefg	that's a bit of a problem since i can only access its shell :\
2006-12-29T09:53:00.000Z	stefg	psycode	no, then all you can do is edit the config-file
2006-12-29T09:54:00.000Z	stefg	psycode	but a reboot should fix it, if the gateway is right then
2006-12-29T09:55:00.000Z	psycode	stefg	k thx
2006-12-29T09:58:00.000Z	psycode	stefg	a reboot did the job :) thanks!
