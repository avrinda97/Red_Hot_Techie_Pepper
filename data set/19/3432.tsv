2009-08-12T03:28:00.000Z	kunji		....I'm kind of confused on how I would go about doing this...I already have a partition with windows 7, how would I go about using that for virtualbox?
2009-08-12T03:30:00.000Z	User9927	kunji	>  Your question pertains to using Virtualbox under Windows 7?
2009-08-12T03:31:00.000Z	kunji	User9927	No, using virtualbox on Ubuntu 9.04 to run windows 7, which is installed on another partition of the same hard drive
2009-08-12T03:32:00.000Z	User9927	kunji	>  Aha!  Okay, well I've never tried running Windows 7 under Virtualbox in Ubuntu 9.04.  Do you have it downloaded and set up?  Where are you having trouble?
2009-08-12T03:34:00.000Z	kunji	User9927	I installed it from the repositories and after opening it I went to new, then next, picked the os and a name for it next, picked the amount of ram to allocate (only goes to 3584 MB though?) next, and I'm not sure what to do at the next prompt.
2009-08-12T03:35:00.000Z	User9927	kunji	>  What does the next prompt say?
2009-08-12T03:36:00.000Z	kunji	User9927	Select a hard disk image to be used as the boot hard disk....
2009-08-12T03:37:00.000Z	User9927	kunji	>  Ah, okay.  You may need to create a new virtual hard disk.  There should be a set of icons on a toolbar above a screen which normally lists the virtual hard disks.  Mouse over them to see which button does what, and when you find one that says "Create New Hard Disk" or something similar, click it.
2009-08-12T03:41:00.000Z	User9927	kunji	>  Were you having trouble setting VirtualBox up generally, or were you getting a specific error?
2009-08-12T03:45:00.000Z	kunji	User9927	 Just general setup trouble.  When I create the virtual disk how large should I make it?
2009-08-12T03:47:00.000Z	User9927	kunji	>  As much as you think it would be practical to have, given your system specs.  So for the *bare minimum*, (according to Microsoft's Website), 1GB RAM (32 Bit)/2GB Ram (64 Bit), 16 GB of Hard drive space, and a decent amount of graphics memory.
2009-08-12T03:47:00.000Z	User9927	kunji	>  So add however much you think would be practical to the minimum.  Of course, I'd reccommend more than 1GB of RAM for Windows 7, since I usually use about that for Ubuntu to keep it running smoothly.
2009-08-12T03:48:00.000Z	User9927	kunji	>  Dr_Willis has a good point, you can always resize it later.
2009-08-12T03:52:00.000Z	User9927	kunji	>  Unless you're planning on storing massive amounts of audio, video, and other media on it, that should do you for the time being.  And it will expand as needed.

2009-08-12T04:07:00.000Z	kunji	User9927	on that site, in the 4th command line box I'll need to change /dev/sda to my partition right, will I need to change the part that says partitions 2 ?
2009-08-12T04:10:00.000Z	User9927	kunji	>  I honestly have no idea.  I've only ever set up clean disks on VirtualBox, otherwise I'd tell you myself instead of directing you to that site. :-)
2009-08-12T04:12:00.000Z	User9927	kunji	>  I need to get going, but here's a walkthrough that I found of how to set up Windows 7 (a clean install) on VirtualBox.  http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9127980/Take_Windows_7_for_a_spin_with_VirtualBox
2009-08-12T04:13:00.000Z	kunji	User9927	Thanks, I'm gonna try it.... I'll let you know how it turns out.
