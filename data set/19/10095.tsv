2007-07-27T15:42:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	bene	i've never used type3. my first bet would be to look at /var/www/ and see if there's a folder called typo3 in there
2007-07-27T15:43:00.000Z	bene	howlingmadhowie	there is nothing, that was the first I was looking for
2007-07-27T15:44:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	bene	maybe there's a typo3 configuration utility which will generate that.
2007-07-27T15:46:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	bene	there are two packages called "typo3-testsite" and "typo3-quickstart" . maybe they'll help you here
2007-07-27T15:47:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	bene	i'm just installing it now. i'll let you know what i do to get it to work (if i can get it to work)
2007-07-27T15:51:00.000Z	bene	howlingmadhowie	hmm
2007-07-27T15:51:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	bene	is it doing anything?
2007-07-27T15:53:00.000Z	bene	howlingmadhowie	no =(
2007-07-27T16:01:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	bene	if you can read german http://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/TYPO3
2007-07-27T16:01:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	bene	if not, we can open a private chat and i can guide you through it (provided the german instructions work)
2007-07-27T16:05:00.000Z	bene	howlingmadhowie	look at single chat
2007-07-27T16:06:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	bene	i've never used single chat, what do i do?
2007-07-27T16:06:00.000Z	bene	howlingmadhowie	I try the wiki howto
2007-07-27T16:07:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	bene	look in /usr/share/typo3. you'll find the source there
2007-07-27T16:26:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	bene	how far have you got? Ive got to " cannot find configuration. this file is probably executed from the wrong location" :)
2007-07-27T16:40:00.000Z	bene	howlingmadhowie	ln -s /usr/share/typo3 was the only think I must do ^^
2007-07-27T16:42:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	bene	 cool :) where did you link it to? /var/www ?
2007-07-27T16:49:00.000Z	bene	howlingmadhowie	yes
2007-07-27T16:53:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	bene	doesn't work with me :( i keep getting "Cannot find configuration. This file is probably executed from the wrong location."
