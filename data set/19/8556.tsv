2008-08-22T11:31:00.000Z	Dacvak		Could someone be extremely helpful and tell me step by step what I need to do in order to add 1024x768 to my possible screen resolutions?
2008-08-22T11:33:00.000Z	Dacvak		No one here knows how to add screen resolutions that aren't listed?
2008-08-22T11:33:00.000Z	jeffz	Dacvak	usually by adding them to xorg.conf
2008-08-22T11:34:00.000Z	Dacvak	jeffz	I'm an ubuntu noob. Can you tell me what to type?
2008-08-22T11:34:00.000Z	jeffz	Dacvak	if you do it wrong then X may not start
2008-08-22T11:35:00.000Z	jeffz	Dacvak	first of all, open /etc/X11/xorg.conf in a text editor, scroll to the bottom and you should see a list of default resolutions
2008-08-22T11:35:00.000Z	jeffz	Dacvak	tell me when you understand what you're looking at
2008-08-22T11:37:00.000Z	Dacvak	jeffz	I'm in xorg.conf right now. I'm just trying to add 1024x768 as a possible resolution
2008-08-22T11:37:00.000Z	jeffz	Dacvak	you should see the existing format, just write in the new value so that it looks the same
2008-08-22T11:37:00.000Z	jeffz	Dacvak	but, to save this file you'll need to edit it using sudo
2008-08-22T11:37:00.000Z	Dacvak	jeffz	I looked around and didn't see anything.
2008-08-22T11:38:00.000Z	jeffz	Dacvak	Dacvak towards the bottom, you should see a list of resolutions
2008-08-22T11:39:00.000Z	Dacvak	jeffz	There are no resolutions for some reason.
2008-08-22T11:39:00.000Z	jeffz	Dacvak	can you copy and paste it to http://rafb.net/paste
2008-08-22T11:41:00.000Z	Dacvak	jeffz	http://rafb.net/p/a9fiiI60.html
2008-08-22T11:41:00.000Z	jeffz	Dacvak	do you have a Section "Screen" in the file?
2008-08-22T11:42:00.000Z	jeffz	Dacvak	mine looks like this http://rafb.net/p/AJllnT70.html
2008-08-22T11:42:00.000Z	Dacvak	jeffz	There are no resolutions listed
2008-08-22T11:43:00.000Z	jeffz	Dacvak	if yours doesn't resemble mine, I think I'll stop trying to help, kind of dizzy, need to take a break
