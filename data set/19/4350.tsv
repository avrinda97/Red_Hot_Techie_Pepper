2009-02-01T13:58:00.000Z	quincunx55555		I was so impressed when I installed ubuntu
2009-02-01T13:59:00.000Z	quincunx55555		anyone here use "approx", or other programs to get one computer to look at a local computer for repository downloads?
2009-02-01T14:00:00.000Z	quincunx55555		my isp caps my bandwidth, and since both computer download mostly the same stuff, I've been trying to figure how to get them to share
2009-02-01T14:01:00.000Z	_2	quincunx55555	common storage area ?  sshfs maybe ?    or a caching server ?
2009-02-01T14:02:00.000Z	quincunx55555	_2	with approx, you can get one machine to check another for packages before checking the internet
2009-02-01T14:03:00.000Z	_2	quincunx55555	yeah,  there are also caching proxy services for linux   would make that more seemless
2009-02-01T14:04:00.000Z	_2	quincunx55555	right now the most common name eludes me.
2009-02-01T14:04:00.000Z	quincunx55555	_2	it seems like that is what "approx" does.  From comments that I googled, people were favoring approx to the other similar apps
2009-02-01T14:05:00.000Z	_2	quincunx55555	  squid  maybe
2009-02-01T14:08:00.000Z	_2	quincunx55555	if you are only talking about the debian packages  then  their are several ways and yes approx is one
2009-02-01T14:09:00.000Z	quincunx55555	_2	yea, I'm not sure if approx is supposed to be running on both machines, where the config file is supposed to be (one machine, or both)
2009-02-01T14:11:00.000Z	_2	quincunx55555	it might also be to your liking to just share the /var/cache/apt/packages/  with the remote box  mounting it on the dir of the same name   again sshfs would work well for that.
2009-02-01T14:11:00.000Z	_2	quincunx55555	that's a pretty easy fast and simple setup
2009-02-01T14:12:00.000Z	quincunx55555	_2	yea, actually, thanks.  I would have never thought of that
2009-02-01T14:13:00.000Z	_2	quincunx55555	welcome.   i actually used that setup for a while, i'm on dialup and don't want to dl any more than i have to.
2009-02-01T14:14:00.000Z	quincunx55555	_2	when my ISP throttles me down after downloading too much per month, it's worse than dialup
2009-02-01T14:14:00.000Z	_2	quincunx55555	no. you have forgotten how slow dialup is.
2009-02-01T14:14:00.000Z	quincunx55555	_2	well, I can only connect after 11pm, and then only text chat, maybe download a text web page
2009-02-01T14:15:00.000Z	_2	quincunx55555	heh.  yeah  that's about the same.
