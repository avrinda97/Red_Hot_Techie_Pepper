2012-06-02T01:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	EtgarDizz	where from?
2012-06-02T01:01:00.000Z	EtgarDizz	ActionParsnip	/usr/share/gnome-shell/open-search-providers/
2012-06-02T01:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	EtgarDizz	ah, i don't use gnome-shell, sorry
2012-06-04T14:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	EtgarDizz	why would you need wine?
2012-06-04T14:39:00.000Z	EtgarDizz	ActionParsnip	that's cos most things i've found online suggest using Foxit reader throught wine, cos the linuxy version is buggy
2012-06-04T14:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	EtgarDizz	what pdf viewers have you tried?
2012-06-04T14:40:00.000Z	EtgarDizz	ActionParsnip	foxit for linux, evince, okular, xpdfepdfviewer
2012-06-04T14:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	EtgarDizz	evince has tabs
2012-06-04T14:42:00.000Z	EtgarDizz	ActionParsnip	how do u activate tabs on evince?
2012-06-04T14:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	EtgarDizz	just open another PDF in it and it should work
2012-06-04T14:43:00.000Z	EtgarDizz	ActionParsnip	I'm doing that, and it just opens more and more windows...
2012-06-04T14:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	EtgarDizz	seems its just an idea: http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com/item/15899/
2012-06-04T14:44:00.000Z	EtgarDizz	ActionParsnip	yes, i've seen that request :) any other ideas?
2012-06-04T14:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	EtgarDizz	have you tried the adobe PDF reader?
2012-06-04T14:46:00.000Z	EtgarDizz	ActionParsnip	i've tried it, but i am looking for something more OS and less proprietary :) also it's bulky and convoluted in my opinion, that's why i like evince
2012-06-04T14:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	EtgarDizz	surely its sleeker than wine + windows app.....
2012-06-04T14:49:00.000Z	EtgarDizz	ActionParsnip	i agree :) that's why i was looking for something more lightweight like evince, just that supports tabs
2012-06-04T14:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	EtgarDizz	I believe the text in the .desktop file in /usr/share/applications dictates that stuff
