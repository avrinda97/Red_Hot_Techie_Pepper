2010-08-26T19:24:00.000Z	sacarlson	gasull	it apears to be some kind of encypted install?  can't you just install a ubuntu live cd and encypt it later?
2010-08-26T19:27:00.000Z	gasull	sacarlson	I was able to boot my system commenting that line out.  But I wonder why I cannot boot up with that line.
2010-08-26T19:29:00.000Z	sacarlson	gasull	I just setup an encrypted account today, it's built in on 10.04,  just create an account an select encypt box.  keep on account unecrypted so you can still do repairs and run your user as encypted.
2010-08-26T20:01:00.000Z	gasull	sacarlson	sorry, I had to go for a few minutes.  I have my hard drive encrypted, that secures it from being stolen.  But I'm using DropBox for online backups, so when I travel I have my docs there if I need them and there's a problem (it already happened to me). I want to have my docs encrypted in Dropbox with EncFS.
2010-08-26T20:02:00.000Z	sacarlson	gasull	well it's easy to setup with just your personal home dir encrypted.  just create a new account that's encrypted.  on 10.04 it's built in
2010-08-26T20:03:00.000Z	sacarlson	gasull	if you want to change the encryption method I guess you can do that.  but I would setup a secound account to encrypt and keep a usable unencrypted account for service and repair.
2010-08-26T20:05:00.000Z	gasull	sacarlson	how is the home dir encrypted? with encfs?
2010-08-26T20:05:00.000Z	gasull	sacarlson	are we talking about the same thing?
2010-08-26T20:05:00.000Z	sacarlson	gasull	yes I think so
2010-08-26T20:07:00.000Z	sacarlson	gasull	take a look https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EncryptedHome  I was about to try this in a test account to find it was just one box to set at user create to have it all done for you.
2010-08-26T20:08:00.000Z	sacarlson	gasull	it defaults to use AES256 encryption
2010-08-26T20:16:00.000Z	gasull	sacarlson	I'm reading about it, but I still don't get if this will encrypt /home/myuser or /home/myuser/Private
2010-08-26T20:19:00.000Z	sacarlson	gasull	it can do eather but I setup so that is encrypted /home/myuser dir
2010-08-26T20:21:00.000Z	gasull	sacarlson	I see
2010-08-26T20:22:00.000Z	sacarlson	gasull	takes about 3 minits to setup a complete new account with fully encrypted /home/mydir  System>Administration>User groups>add >click encrypt botton box.
2010-08-26T21:17:00.000Z	gasull	sacarlson	My understanding is that eCryptFS won't help in this scenario: My laptop is broken or I don't have it with me and I am travelling. I can access my encrypted documents in Dropbox. If I was using eCryptFS, can I decrypt them?
2010-11-20T09:03:00.000Z	sacarlson	gasull	is proxy from your self posible?  does your proxy from yourself work with a browser?
2010-11-20T09:05:00.000Z	gasull	sacarlson	I'm using ssh tunneling as a proxy
2010-11-20T09:06:00.000Z	sacarlson	gasull	ok and does firefox work with it?
