2010-04-19T14:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Rocket16: its not working because you used the rpm. Find a deb file or a ppa to install the dep
2010-04-19T14:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Rocket16: just because its not on the site doesn't mean it doesn't exist
2010-04-19T14:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Rocket16: alien is really not advised. Find a ppa or deb online. You may even find a ppa for wesnoth, or one may be on getdeb
2010-04-19T14:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Rocket16: then you will need to compile libsdl

2010-04-19T14:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Rocket16: there are some sdl packages on the repo which may give you what you need
2010-04-19T14:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Peddy	if you had 2 x servers you could set seperate wallpapers but a combined image is far easier in my eyes
2010-04-19T14:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Rocket16: have you checked getdeb for a wesnoth deb?
2010-04-19T14:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Rocket16: you could contact them and ask how they made it
2010-04-19T14:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Rocket16: I see

2010-04-19T15:04:00.000Z	Peddy2	ActionParsnip	if I did 2 seperate X servers, would the monitors be able to interact with each other?..
