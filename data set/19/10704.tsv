2007-05-16T12:12:00.000Z	ori		anything to extend batery life for laptops running ubuntu?
2007-05-16T12:13:00.000Z	rohan	ori	well, not much .. turn of the unnecessary services.
2007-05-16T12:13:00.000Z	rohan	ori	but i think the kernel 2.6.21 should significantly help battery life. but we won't have it till gutsy gibbon is released .. so well :(
2007-05-16T12:14:00.000Z	ori	rohan	ok so there's no power management software or anything?
2007-05-16T12:14:00.000Z	rohan	ori	oh, there is ofcourse. what do you use ? gnome or kde ?
2007-05-16T12:14:00.000Z	rohan	ori	on gnome, press alt-f2 type "gnome-power-manager"
2007-05-16T12:14:00.000Z	ori	rohan	gnome
2007-05-16T12:15:00.000Z	ori	rohan	does it do much?
2007-05-16T12:15:00.000Z	rohan	ori	yep, it's excelent
2007-05-16T12:15:00.000Z	ori	rohan	thanks a lot
2007-05-16T12:15:00.000Z	rohan	ori	np. and on kde there should be a battery icon in your system notification area
2007-05-16T12:16:00.000Z	rohan	ori	which laptop is it ? (just curiosity)
2007-05-16T12:16:00.000Z	ori	rohan	aspire 5100
2007-05-16T12:16:00.000Z	rohan	ori	ah ok. so you won't have any software brightness control.
2007-05-16T12:17:00.000Z	ori	rohan	could I download something?
2007-05-16T12:19:00.000Z	rohan	ori	no. our only hope is to email acer and have them make a software so that linux can access bios. but until then you won't get cool features like brightness reduces to half when AC adapter is removied
2007-05-16T12:19:00.000Z	ori	rohan	it does reduce brightness a bit I've noticed
2007-05-16T12:20:00.000Z	rohan	ori	oh ? cool .. it doesn't work here on my acer travelmate 3260
2007-05-16T12:20:00.000Z	ori	rohan	I think this is newer
