2010-02-26T06:26:00.000Z	Gstar		sorry spokes you have to remind me what the issue was
2010-02-26T06:27:00.000Z	Gstar		use the older kernel then
2010-02-26T06:28:00.000Z	Gstar		linux is not windows just because something is upgraded you dont have to use it
2010-02-26T06:29:00.000Z	Gstar		probably because 2.6.28 is not a valid ip internally or externally

2010-02-26T06:39:00.000Z	Viking667	Gstar	does the same thing.
2010-02-26T06:40:00.000Z	Viking667	Gstar	For mandrake, I believe the behaviour was the same. I haven't run it since 10.2 thoug, when they changed over to Mandriva
2010-02-26T06:41:00.000Z	Viking667	Gstar	yes. Since 10.2
