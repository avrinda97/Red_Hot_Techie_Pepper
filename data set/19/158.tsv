2012-10-10T23:37:00.000Z	rsser		I'm on ubuntu 12.04, I've installed plymouth. But when I reboot the system I can't see the splash, because it so fast. How to fix that?
2012-10-10T23:38:00.000Z	rsser		I was reading on this website ==> http://www.ubuntugeek.com/quick-tipplymouth-themes-in-ubuntu-10-04-lucid-lynx.html => but the info is TOO OLD
2012-10-10T23:38:00.000Z	rsser		CPU Info: (8 CPU's - Intel Core(TM) i7-2600K CPU @, 3.41 GHz, (20% Load))
2012-10-10T23:39:00.000Z	rsser		yeah, StefanT
2012-10-10T23:39:00.000Z	rsser		I guess
2012-10-10T23:40:00.000Z	rsser		how does sleep work, StefanT?
2012-10-10T23:40:00.000Z	rsser		I didn't get it
2012-10-10T23:40:00.000Z	zykotick9	rsser	fyi "20% load" doesn't make any sense.  load is NOT a %
2012-10-10T23:40:00.000Z	rsser	zykotick9	it is refering about cpu usage
2012-10-10T23:41:00.000Z	zykotick9	rsser	"i" know what load is, you're a bit confused on the subject.
2012-10-10T23:42:00.000Z	zykotick9	rsser	then don't call it "load" :)  load is NOT a % measurement
2012-10-17T01:55:00.000Z	zykotick9	rsser	right an install script ;) "sudo apt-get install foo1 foo2 etc" is how i deal with that...
2012-10-17T01:58:00.000Z	rsser	zykotick9	what does foo mean?
2012-10-17T01:59:00.000Z	zykotick9	rsser	"foo" is a variable, insert what you really need in place ;)  it's a unix thing.
2012-10-17T02:00:00.000Z	zykotick9	rsser	sorry, lol.  there is no foo package ;)
2012-10-17T02:01:00.000Z	zykotick9	rsser	i didn't mean too!  sorry.
2012-10-17T02:01:00.000Z	zykotick9	rsser	could you possible ask your question again - all on one line, so the entire channel can see it, thanks.
2012-10-17T02:03:00.000Z	zykotick9	rsser	i still find that a bit unclear.  i guess i misunterpreted what you wanted the first time ;)  best of luck.
2012-10-17T02:06:00.000Z	zykotick9	rsser	do you have a technical issue right now?  if not, it's OT (see "/msg ubottu ot" for details)?
