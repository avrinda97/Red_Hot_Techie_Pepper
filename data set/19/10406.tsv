2008-07-14T17:37:00.000Z	MatthewV	bushwakko	something here about high cpu usage being normal for glxgears... http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Glxgears_is_not_a_Benchmark FWIW i have the same graphics card as you and also get 100% cpu usage...
2008-07-14T17:37:00.000Z	bushwakko	MatthewV	dragging windows around also gives high cpu
2008-07-14T17:38:00.000Z	bushwakko	MatthewV	whats your fps in glxgears then?
2008-07-14T17:38:00.000Z	MatthewV	bushwakko	i dont know, cant remember the switch to show fps ;)
2008-07-14T17:38:00.000Z	bushwakko	MatthewV	glxgears shows its fps in console
2008-07-14T17:38:00.000Z	bushwakko		just type glxgears in a console and you'll see it
2008-07-14T17:39:00.000Z	MatthewV	bushwakko	not by default - it needs a switch, to do so, and I can't remember it ;)
2008-07-14T17:39:00.000Z	bushwakko	MatthewV	pretty sure i've never used a switch
2008-07-14T17:39:00.000Z	bushwakko		just turn it on
2008-07-14T17:39:00.000Z	bushwakko		wait 5 sec
2008-07-14T17:39:00.000Z	bushwakko		it will report it
2008-07-14T17:40:00.000Z	bushwakko		9829 frames in 5.0 seconds = 1965.758 FPS
2008-07-14T17:40:00.000Z	MatthewV	bushwakko	ah you're right, sorry that was the case in the old one - i get around 3300 fps, with that vid card, athlon X2 3800+ and 1GB ram
2008-07-14T17:41:00.000Z	bushwakko	MatthewV	seems wrong to me though
2008-07-14T17:41:00.000Z	MatthewV	bushwakko	i personally wouldn't worry about it, unless its affecting other things...
2008-07-14T17:42:00.000Z	bushwakko	MatthewV	I started checking this stuff out after getting some poor performance in the kde4 effects, like their impl. of wobbly windows and stuff
2008-07-14T17:42:00.000Z	MatthewV	bushwakko	well i'm running gnome and stock compiz - so i can't really help you other than to let you know that it all works fine for me..
2008-07-14T17:50:00.000Z	bushwakko	MatthewV	5,5 fps 116 in score in the sanctuary demo benchmark! doesn't sound right at all
2008-07-14T17:51:00.000Z	MatthewV	bushwakko	i can't help you at all with that, I'm sorry...
