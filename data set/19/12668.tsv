2005-07-27T12:33:00.000Z	The_Vox	LuNaTiK^GuY	you can chose gnome or kde in the login screen
2005-07-27T12:41:00.000Z	The_Vox	LuNaTiK^GuY	X paints pixels in your screen...kde or gnome or enlightenment or whatever else just tells X which pixels to paint and with what characteristics to paint them
2005-07-28T13:58:00.000Z	The_Vox	LuNaTiK^GuY	yes
2005-07-28T13:59:00.000Z	LuNaTiK^GuY	The_Vox	also after doing all the guide says...should i modify the xorg.conf?
2005-07-28T14:00:00.000Z	The_Vox	LuNaTiK^GuY	check it...in most instances it *should* be modified by debconf when installing the -glx package, but..."trust but verify" should be your life's motto :)
2005-07-28T14:14:00.000Z	The_Vox	LuNaTiK^GuY	edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2005-07-28T14:14:00.000Z	LuNaTiK^GuY	The_Vox	i dont know where and what to edit!
2005-07-28T14:15:00.000Z	The_Vox	LuNaTiK^GuY	it's actually pretty obvious...the line you want is Refresh or VertRefresh or something like that
2005-07-28T14:16:00.000Z	LuNaTiK^GuY	The_Vox	10ks i;ll see wot i can do
