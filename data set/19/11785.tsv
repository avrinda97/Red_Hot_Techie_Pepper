2005-11-21T14:12:00.000Z	polpak	darkness_	read the getting started guide
2005-11-21T14:25:00.000Z	polpak	darkness_	my guess is you missed a step..
2005-11-21T14:26:00.000Z	darkness_	polpak	i can't see how i stuffed it up.
2005-11-21T14:26:00.000Z	polpak	darkness_	well what did you do?
2005-11-21T14:26:00.000Z	darkness_	polpak	I did exactly what it told me to do on the site. I typed it in word for word, but i had to change the file name because it was different to the one in the tutorial thing.
2005-11-21T14:27:00.000Z	polpak	darkness_	 Which site?
2005-11-21T14:27:00.000Z	darkness_	polpak	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats
2005-11-21T14:28:00.000Z	polpak	darkness_	Did you install the Blackdown installer? or Sun Java JRE 5.0
2005-11-21T14:29:00.000Z	polpak	darkness_	 There were 2 sets of instructions on that site. Which one did you follow?
2005-11-21T14:30:00.000Z	polpak	darkness_	Also did you sudo update-alternatives --config java
2005-11-21T14:31:00.000Z	polpak	darkness_	you want the sun one
2005-11-21T14:32:00.000Z	polpak	darkness_	so did you select it?
2005-11-21T14:33:00.000Z	polpak	darkness_	It should give you a menu and ask for a number
2005-11-21T14:33:00.000Z	polpak	darkness_	you want to choose the one for sun jre
2005-11-21T14:36:00.000Z	polpak	darkness_	blame sun and their restrictive licensing
2005-11-21T14:36:00.000Z	polpak	darkness_	They won't let anyone distribute java but them
