2006-03-09T08:51:00.000Z	wastrel		ok gedit is leaving little poop files all over my filesystem!  how long do these things stick around?  filename~
2006-03-09T08:51:00.000Z	kbrooks	wastrel	any filename with ~ means "backup"
2006-03-09T08:52:00.000Z	wastrel	kbrooks	 new to me :] 
2006-03-09T09:08:00.000Z	wastrel	kbrooks	 where'd this file~ = backup thing come from ?  is it a gnomeism?
2006-03-09T09:08:00.000Z	kbrooks	wastrel	No.
2006-03-09T09:08:00.000Z	kbrooks	wastrel	its a unixism

2006-07-01T07:40:00.000Z	wastrel	kbrooks	 i'm gathering that it lets you run both 32 and 64 bit apps on a 64 bit kernel (?)
2006-07-01T07:42:00.000Z	kbrooks	wastrel	hate, hate, hate, eh?
2006-07-01T07:51:00.000Z	kbrooks	wastrel	oh really?

2006-07-01T07:52:00.000Z	wastrel	kbrooks	 i gathered that people weren't being discriminating about the factoids they were adding.  not commercial spamming :] 
2007-08-30T06:47:00.000Z	wastrel	kbrooks	 maybe chmod the gnome config files read only?
2007-10-08T06:50:00.000Z	kbrooks	wastrel	a language
