2005-06-15T14:29:00.000Z	lonewolff	joxer	to change the language the output comes in - log out and select a different language from the login screen (assuming its installed)
2005-06-15T14:34:00.000Z	joxer	lonewolff	heres the error i get, libwxgtk2.4-python has no installation candidate
2005-06-15T14:34:00.000Z	lonewolff	joxer	try enabling universe in your config
2005-06-15T14:34:00.000Z	joxer	lonewolff	ok ?

2005-06-15T14:35:00.000Z	lonewolff	joxer	edit /etc/apt/sources.list and un comment the commented stuff, or do it in synaptic (not sure how as i dont use it)
