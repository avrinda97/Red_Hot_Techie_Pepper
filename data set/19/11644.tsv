2005-12-15T09:32:00.000Z	Emberly		anyone know how to download a .run file from a website that won't let you 'save-as' ?  it just opens inside the browser

2005-12-15T09:34:00.000Z	Emberly	HymnToLife	do you know what browser settings to tweak?  I'm using firefox?
2005-12-15T09:42:00.000Z	HymnToLife	Emberly	> in FF 1.5 : Edit > Preferences > Downloads > View & Edit Actions
2005-12-15T09:45:00.000Z	Emberly	HymnToLife	I'm still trying to locate that preference setting but I don't see it...
2005-12-15T09:46:00.000Z	HymnToLife	Emberly	> which FF version do you run ?
2005-12-15T09:47:00.000Z	Emberly	HymnToLife	1.07.  i see "change action" but it is greyed out. i can edit the plugin behavior but i can't tell it "do this to this type of file"
2005-12-15T09:47:00.000Z	HymnToLife	Emberly	> upgrade to 1.5 :)
2005-12-15T09:48:00.000Z	Emberly	HymnToLife	it's on my to-do list.  But there must be a way to download a .run file from a website like that. I can't imagine that no linux user has ever downloaded .run files from a website like that before me...
2005-12-15T09:48:00.000Z	Emberly	HymnToLife	thanks for the help and i'm not trying to be a smart-ass...
2005-12-15T09:49:00.000Z	Emberly	HymnToLife	ok i'll try flashgot
2005-12-15T09:57:00.000Z	HymnToLife	Emberly	> try with another browser then (Opera)
2005-12-15T09:59:00.000Z	HymnToLife	Emberly	> or you can use opera
2005-12-15T09:59:00.000Z	Emberly	HymnToLife	I guess i could try opera, but i've never had any other reason to switch away from firefox
2005-12-15T09:59:00.000Z	Emberly	HymnToLife	seems like a very round-about work-around.
2005-12-15T09:59:00.000Z	HymnToLife	Emberly	> neither do I
2005-12-15T10:00:00.000Z	HymnToLife	Emberly	> but you vould have opera, just to use in such cases
2005-12-15T10:04:00.000Z	Emberly	HymnToLife	I upgraded firefox to 1.5 but that settings section you are talking about actually doesn't let you add or customize filetypes. it lets you change how existing behaviors work
2005-12-15T10:05:00.000Z	HymnToLife	Emberly	> then try with opera
