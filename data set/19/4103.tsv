2010-01-19T05:29:00.000Z	meganerd		I am glad to have left the CRT world behind
2010-01-19T05:29:00.000Z	meganerd		I had a 21" CRT once, it broke my desk
2010-01-19T05:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	meganerd	 hard on the back also... :)
2010-01-24T14:14:00.000Z	meganerd	Dr_Willis	it is a VPN protocol
2010-01-24T14:21:00.000Z	meganerd	Dr_Willis	at least Intel's drivers are upstream... and the latest ATI as well
2010-01-24T14:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	meganerd	 it is.. and ntfs-config tweaks it to allow users to mount ntfs/vfat on removeable media.
2010-01-24T14:30:00.000Z	meganerd	Dr_Willis	on 9.10 that works out of the box for me, no need to tweak
2010-01-24T14:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	meganerd	 ive had it work for some.. and not for others.. Not sure why
2010-01-24T14:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	meganerd	 had some be read only
2010-01-24T14:30:00.000Z	meganerd	Dr_Willis	I usually install ntfsprogs so that I can run ntfsfix on volumes that were not cleanly unmounted
2010-01-24T14:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	meganerd	 ive heard thats not totally safe.. but  whatever works. :)
2010-01-24T14:31:00.000Z	meganerd	Dr_Willis	I have been using it for a couple of years without issue
2010-01-24T14:32:00.000Z	meganerd	Dr_Willis	I usually just format the drives ext3 now, ext2 for flash devices
2010-03-14T14:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	meganerd	 theres whold guides on customing the bash Prompt. :)
2010-03-14T14:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	meganerd	 and i recall some PS 'constructor' tool also
2010-03-14T14:47:00.000Z	meganerd	Dr_Willis	there are guides, but I built mine in the late 90s.
2010-03-14T14:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	meganerd	 you just use the proper escape codes to change the color
2010-03-14T14:48:00.000Z	meganerd	Dr_Willis	It is simply once you learn the syntax.  I have just grown attached to how mine looks.
2010-03-14T14:52:00.000Z	meganerd	Dr_Willis	I never used it.  I just followed some guides then spent hours playing with it.  Of course most of my friends thought I was an idiot doing this while they were having fun with Starcraft :)
