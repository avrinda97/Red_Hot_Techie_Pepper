2005-06-20T09:02:00.000Z	mhz		How can I know which group is running php???
2005-06-20T09:02:00.000Z	bob2	mhz	ps aux
2005-06-20T09:04:00.000Z	mhz	bob2	nop, ps ax |grep -i php
2005-06-20T09:04:00.000Z	bob2	mhz	er, presumably you're running it as a module inside apache
2005-06-20T09:05:00.000Z	mhz	bob2	if so, then it is www-data
2005-06-20T09:05:00.000Z	bob2	mhz	yes
2005-10-09T10:58:00.000Z	bob2	mhz	that's really annoying
2005-10-09T10:58:00.000Z	bob2	mhz	just ask your question
2005-10-09T10:59:00.000Z	mhz	bob2	why annoying?
2005-10-09T10:59:00.000Z	bob2	mhz	omg!1111
2005-10-09T10:59:00.000Z	bob2	mhz	just ask your question, no need for annoying levels of punctuation
2005-10-09T11:00:00.000Z	bob2	mhz	where did you explain the problem?
2005-10-09T11:01:00.000Z	mhz	bob2	#elive, #ubuntu-laptop, #kubuntu, #debian (the latter 6 hours ago)
2005-10-09T11:02:00.000Z	bob2	mhz	er
2005-10-09T11:02:00.000Z	bob2	mhz	presumably you're not having the identical problem on Debian and Ubuntu
2005-10-09T11:03:00.000Z	bob2	mhz	there's no tftp to restart, it runs out of inetd
2005-10-09T11:03:00.000Z	mhz	bob2	I get DHCP right, but when it comes to TFTP.. it times out and reboots to windows :(
2005-10-09T11:03:00.000Z	bob2	mhz	and you still don't seem to have explained what isnt working
2005-10-09T11:05:00.000Z	mhz	bob2	I have a Fujitsu laptop, thin laptop (no cd nor floppy, not usb booting). I must install linux there, but I have 2 options and both have failed. a) Grub4Nt v.0.4 is broken and I can't find 0.2   b) local netboot fails in TFTP :(
