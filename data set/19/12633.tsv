2005-11-21T07:47:00.000Z	trinidad		After searching, I wondered if anyone could point me to a replacement for WinISO in Linux.
2005-11-21T07:48:00.000Z	trinidad		any good .iso file manipulation apps for windows besides "mount"
2005-11-21T07:49:00.000Z	trappist	trinidad	what do you want to do with it
2005-11-21T07:49:00.000Z	trinidad	trappist	I can use rar for most of my iso's, but for some they don't work.  I am just trying to view/extract
2005-11-21T07:50:00.000Z	trinidad	trappist	I used to use WinISO and MagicISO in Windows.  Now that I've migrated to Linux, I am in need of an ISO utility app
2005-11-21T07:50:00.000Z	trappist	trinidad	I don't know what those things do.  what are you trying to do.
2005-11-21T07:51:00.000Z	trinidad	trappist	open/view/extract .iso files
2005-11-21T07:51:00.000Z	trappist	trinidad	oh.  well then, pretty much you mount them and treat them like any other (read-only) filesystem.
2005-11-21T07:51:00.000Z	trappist	trinidad	umount
2005-11-21T07:52:00.000Z	trappist	trinidad	get out of the filesystem :)
2005-11-21T07:52:00.000Z	trinidad	trappist	thanks
2005-11-21T08:06:00.000Z	trinidad	trappist	I have tried to unmount using sudo umount -a in the non mounted directory but to no avail, i get a device busy error
2005-11-21T08:07:00.000Z	trappist	trinidad	not -a!  that tries to umount all your filesystems! just sudo umount /where/you/mounted/the/iso
2005-11-21T08:07:00.000Z	trinidad	trappist	ok brb
2005-11-21T08:08:00.000Z	trinidad	trappist	still keep getting device is busy....I have it mounted in ~/Desktop/new....I am running shell at /
2005-11-21T08:09:00.000Z	trappist	trinidad	you don't have anything open that could be using it?  try lsof | grep Desktop/new
2005-11-21T08:10:00.000Z	trappist	trinidad	kill 7907
2005-11-21T08:11:00.000Z	trinidad	trappist	got it to unmount thank you again.....any idea why 7907 is coming up when i mount it
2005-11-21T08:14:00.000Z	trinidad	trappist	thank you for your services sir/mam!
