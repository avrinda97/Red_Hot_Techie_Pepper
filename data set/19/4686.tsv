2008-11-24T00:18:00.000Z	hmw_	Dracey	what exactly do you have in mind?
2008-11-24T00:20:00.000Z	hmw_	Dracey	- usually you should be able just to browse to your windows drive. maybe you didnt name your windows drives, so you will have to find them by some cryptic name, e.g. sda1 in "Places/Computer"
2008-11-24T00:21:00.000Z	hmw_	Dracey	ubuntu can access them by default
2008-11-24T00:22:00.000Z	hmw_	Dracey	did you boot from the LiveCD or is your ubuntu installed onto the hard disk?
2008-11-24T00:27:00.000Z	hmw_	Dracey	you should have full access. but many programs need to be "installed" - meaning, they have to be configured and squeezed into the operating system. you can instert CDs and start the setup like in windows, if you have wine installed already. So called "Portable" apps run without an install process, you can just doubleckick .exe files in these cases.
2008-11-24T00:28:00.000Z	hmw_	Dracey	Notepads runs in wine. Try to find your C: drive, go into the WINDOWS folder, find notepad.exe and tell me, if it pops up.
2008-11-24T00:30:00.000Z	hmw_	Dracey	your install of AIM seems to need the full "install process", so you cant simply start it. You can install it anew into the simulated wine-windows-system. its the same, as if you tried to just copy the program folder of you AIM to another windows pc, whic wouldnt run eithre
2008-11-24T00:31:00.000Z	hmw_	Dracey	if you want to "share" apps between wine and your native windows, go to portableapps.com and use these stuff.
2008-11-24T00:32:00.000Z	hmw_	Dracey	think of your WINE as of a new PC with its own windows. Act according to this. If youre lucky, the programmers made some stuff "independent" or a "Portable" version of that app has been released.
2008-11-24T00:33:00.000Z	hmw_	Dracey	try Pidgin (already installed in your ubuntu) as an alternative to AIM
2008-11-24T00:36:00.000Z	hmw_	Dracey	yes
