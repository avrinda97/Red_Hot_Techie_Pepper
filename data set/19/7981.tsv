2007-05-22T16:01:00.000Z	Silent_G		hello, somebody can tell me how to set the Cflags on ubuntu?
2007-05-22T16:01:00.000Z	Silent_G		how ?
2007-05-22T16:01:00.000Z	Silent_G		its not for me its for a friend
2007-05-22T16:01:00.000Z	Silent_G		uh
2007-05-22T16:01:00.000Z	Silent_G		ok
2007-05-22T16:02:00.000Z	Silent_G		;ole
2007-05-22T16:02:00.000Z	LjL	Silent_G	if you mean rebuilding everything using different gcc flags - this is not gentoo.
2007-05-22T16:03:00.000Z	LjL	Silent_G	packages on Ubuntu come *precompiled*. binary. executable. you don't normally download source and build it. it's possible, and there are automated tools to do it, but if you want to do that sort of thing for *every* or almost every package on the system, then just go use Gentoo, much better off
2007-05-22T16:06:00.000Z	LjL	Silent_G	"cflags" are simply options to the GCC compiler. as such, Ubuntu with GCC installed (like any other distribution) can certainly use them. however, the point is that you normally just *don't compile packages*, in Ubuntu
2007-05-22T16:08:00.000Z	LjL	Silent_G	keep in mind that all these "solutions" i'm giving you are... well, hacks, to be a little extreme. they're not part of Ubuntu's standard package management framework. they may work, they may work with some troubles, they may break stuff.
2007-05-22T16:09:00.000Z	LjL	Silent_G	no, he types "sudo apt-get install xchat", or uses Synaptic
2007-05-22T16:09:00.000Z	LjL	Silent_G	no, he doesn't have to manually download anything.
2007-05-22T16:10:00.000Z	LjL	Silent_G	yes, as long as he's got the right repositories enabled. xchat happens to be in Universe. your friend should probably make sure he's got all of Main, Restricted, Universe and Multiverse enabled. the first two are enabled by default.
2007-05-22T16:11:00.000Z	LjL	Silent_G	of course, we mentioned apt-get now, but he can certainly also use the Synaptic graphical interface if he prefers. they're equivalent.
2007-05-22T16:13:00.000Z	LjL	Silent_G	well, is another process using it? i.e. is there Synaptic open, or another instance of apt-get, or anything that uses the APT system?
2007-05-22T05:03:00.000Z	Silent_G	LjL	is it posible to make KDE as defualt window manager on ubuntu ?
2007-05-22T05:04:00.000Z	Silent_G	LjL	is it posible to make KDE as defualt window manager on ubuntu ?
2007-05-22T05:04:00.000Z	LjL	Silent_G	why don't you just select KDE as your session when you login? it should be remembered the next time.
2007-05-22T05:05:00.000Z	LjL	Silent_G	err, no, Ubuntu comes with GNOME by default. Kubuntu comes with KDE by default.
