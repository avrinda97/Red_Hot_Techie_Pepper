2009-11-04T03:19:00.000Z	Nubosal		Then select it
2009-11-04T03:20:00.000Z	Nubosal		After selecting the RAM
2009-11-04T03:20:00.000Z	Nubosal		Says something about HDD
2009-11-04T03:20:00.000Z	Nubosal		Is not especially hard to setup a Virtual Machine
2009-11-04T03:21:00.000Z	Nubosal		In wich OS are you at the moment, aoupi ?
2009-11-04T03:21:00.000Z	aoupi	Nubosal	neither, it's all fresh
2009-11-04T03:22:00.000Z	Nubosal	aoupi	Boot into the PC, and come and tell us which OS is booted
2009-11-04T03:22:00.000Z	aoupi	Nubosal	blank disc
2009-11-04T03:22:00.000Z	aoupi	Nubosal	nothing on it
2009-11-04T03:22:00.000Z	Nubosal		Oh
2009-11-04T03:22:00.000Z	Nubosal		Mmm
2009-11-04T03:22:00.000Z	Nubosal		I'd recommend to first install Windows
2009-11-04T03:23:00.000Z	Nubosal		Resize the partition to whatever you want in NTFS, and leave the blank space to Ubuntu
2009-11-04T03:23:00.000Z	aoupi	Nubosal	but seems like grub2 will completely forget about windows once ubuntu installs
2009-11-04T03:23:00.000Z	aoupi		so was hoping for some howto, since someone must have done this before
2009-11-04T03:23:00.000Z	aoupi		hrm found this http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1035999
2009-11-04T03:23:00.000Z	aoupi		what a mess :D
2009-11-04T03:23:00.000Z	aoupi		oh well
2009-11-04T03:24:00.000Z	Nubosal	aoupi	No
