2012-03-26T09:13:00.000Z	wylde	J-Escobar	have you tried making a usb thumbdrive?
2012-03-26T09:16:00.000Z	wylde	J-Escobar	sounds like something is misconfigured then.
2012-03-26T09:17:00.000Z	J-Escobar	wylde	yeah i figured that too. but i have tried every possible configuration i could think of. nothing has worked.
2012-03-26T09:17:00.000Z	wylde	J-Escobar	well a usb should work at any rate
2012-03-26T09:18:00.000Z	J-Escobar	wylde	ok so I have it cloned already and bootable. should i just get gparted on a USB and boot from that?
2012-03-26T09:18:00.000Z	wylde	J-Escobar	probably some bios setting hidden under 3 layers of menus with an obscure name lol
2012-03-26T09:19:00.000Z	wylde	J-Escobar	you have access to another computer that can boot the live cd? .... actually, that *might* work
2012-03-26T09:20:00.000Z	J-Escobar	wylde	I do not have another computer here that will work. This is my only PC and using OS X on everything else.
2012-03-26T09:22:00.000Z	wylde	J-Escobar	hmm..does unetbootin work on OSX? ... I wonder
2012-03-26T09:24:00.000Z	J-Escobar	wylde	i downloaded it. what program should i make bootable? i do not see gparted
2012-03-26T09:25:00.000Z	wylde	J-Escobar	gparted is a tool not an os
2012-03-26T09:25:00.000Z	wylde	J-Escobar	there should be ubuntu in the list of options.
2012-03-26T09:25:00.000Z	J-Escobar	wylde	ok, i can boot my hd. i just need to resize it to the full 2tb. what would you use?
2012-03-26T09:26:00.000Z	wylde	J-Escobar	make a bootable usb with unetbootin.... choose ubuntu then you will have to boot from the usb to be able to resize the partition on your hard drive
2012-03-26T09:27:00.000Z	wylde	J-Escobar	you can NOT resize a filesystem you are using. If you boot from your hard drive then you are using it's filesystem....do you understand that?
2012-03-26T09:28:00.000Z	J-Escobar	wylde	i do yes. but i have 2 hard drives with 10.04. and from what i am seeing i do not have the hd mounted that i am wanting to resize. i will try a usb to make sure.
2012-03-26T09:29:00.000Z	wylde	J-Escobar	so...that said. You need to make a bootable usb to use to access your hard drive to resize the partiton
2012-03-26T09:30:00.000Z	wylde	J-Escobar	that would be best, then we know for sure you are not on the partition you want to resize
2012-03-26T09:33:00.000Z	J-Escobar	wylde	ok, i am trying that now.
