2007-02-04T07:00:00.000Z	LjL	Moxxon	there are screenshots on the site i think
2007-02-04T07:00:00.000Z	Moxxon	LjL	whereabouts?
2007-02-04T07:00:00.000Z	LjL	Moxxon	http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop
2007-02-04T15:45:00.000Z	LjL	Moxxon	Gaim
2007-02-04T15:50:00.000Z	LjL	Moxxon	you don't run any script. aMSN can be installed from the Ubuntu repositories, you don't need to download or run anything
2007-02-06T06:16:00.000Z	LjL	Moxxon	err, the *only* flash that is available for ubuntu is the player. what do you think you have?
2007-02-06T06:16:00.000Z	LjL	Moxxon	it is the flash player, i cannot say whether it's version 9 or 7
2007-02-06T06:18:00.000Z	LjL	Moxxon	... debian?
2007-02-06T06:18:00.000Z	LjL	Moxxon	ubuntu != debian
2007-02-06T06:19:00.000Z	LjL	Moxxon	what line does it tell you to add? you SHOULD NOT add repositories intended for Debian to your Ubuntu sources.list!
2007-02-06T06:19:00.000Z	LjL	Moxxon	read the Backports page instead
2007-02-06T06:19:00.000Z	LjL	Moxxon	right, doing that is a totally. terrible. idea.
2007-02-06T06:20:00.000Z	LjL	Moxxon	you'll break your system. use the Ubuntu backports. as i just said. read the page that Ubotu gave you
2007-02-06T06:20:00.000Z	LjL	Moxxon	DO NOT use Debian packages on Ubuntu, and especially DO NOT use Debian repositories on Ubuntu. do it, and you win a free reinstall.
