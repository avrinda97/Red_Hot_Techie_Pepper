2005-04-26T15:16:00.000Z	confrey		I'va installed hoary on my laptop, but I can't suspend to ram; what can I do?
2005-04-26T15:16:00.000Z	delire	confrey	this is not uncommon. one of the only things we linux laptop users usually miss
2005-04-30T14:14:00.000Z	delire	confrey	you need to talk to crimsun, he has a good solution for you. a program 'alsaconf' is what i use to fix this problem, but only in debian.
2005-04-30T14:14:00.000Z	delire	confrey	in the meantime can you 'ls -l dev/snd/seq'?
2005-04-30T14:15:00.000Z	delire	confrey	ubuntu is just 'desktop debian'. can't compare them without including the application.
2005-04-30T14:16:00.000Z	confrey	delire	I haven't it, and in sndstat I have this :
2005-04-30T14:17:00.000Z	delire	confrey	no.. 'ls -l dev/snd/seq'?
2005-04-30T14:17:00.000Z	confrey	delire	no
2005-04-30T14:17:00.000Z	delire	confrey	precisely see /etc/modiles.conf and or ~/.asoundrc
2005-04-30T14:18:00.000Z	delire	confrey	/etc/modules.conf i mean to say
2005-04-30T14:18:00.000Z	confrey	delire	what can I find in modules.conf?
2005-04-30T14:19:00.000Z	delire	confrey	all the aliasing mapping for devices and their system names/addresses.
2005-04-30T14:19:00.000Z	delire	confrey	but as i say, talk to crimsun. there's an 'Ubuntu way' for doing this, that he reccomends.
2005-04-30T14:19:00.000Z	delire	confrey	i would say it has something to do with 'modconf' or similar.
2005-04-30T14:20:00.000Z	delire	confrey	perhaps 'modules-config'
2005-04-30T14:20:00.000Z	confrey	delire	is there some doc, or wiki page about?
2005-04-30T14:21:00.000Z	delire	confrey	search based on the relevant part of your error in http://google.com/linux
2005-04-30T15:32:00.000Z	confrey	delire	hi, crimsun - it seems- is not here, do you know something about jachd and qjackctl?
2005-04-30T15:33:00.000Z	delire	confrey	yep what's up
