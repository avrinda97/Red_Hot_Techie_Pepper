2010-04-26T20:39:00.000Z	QueeenZ		Why can't an Extended partition be deleted?
2010-04-26T20:39:00.000Z	sebsebseb	QueeenZ	it's a container
2010-04-26T20:39:00.000Z	sebsebseb	QueeenZ	so to get rid of an extended partiton, you would have to delete teh partitions inside it
2010-04-26T20:40:00.000Z	sebsebseb	QueeenZ	yep, and of course have any data backed up first if there is anything.
2010-04-26T20:41:00.000Z	sebsebseb	QueeenZ	I mean if you delete a partition that has data on it,  the partition and the data will go,  may be able to recover the data though
2010-04-26T20:42:00.000Z	sebsebseb	QueeenZ	see above for my mesage, if you missed it, since the mini net split
2010-04-26T20:42:00.000Z	QueeenZ	sebsebseb	saw it, thanks for the info
2010-04-26T20:42:00.000Z	sebsebseb	QueeenZ	oh?
2010-04-26T20:43:00.000Z	QueeenZ	sebsebseb	yep, it's such a mess... i have like 10 partitions and most of them i don't need... so i'm trying to organize them..
2010-04-26T20:43:00.000Z	sebsebseb	QueeenZ	How so?  I mean Karmic or Hardy can be upgraded to Lucid when it's time.  Clean installs of Karmic  will have Ext4 file system by default, and so on upgrade to Lucid yep.  Where as Hardy upgrades will still have Ext3.
2010-04-26T20:44:00.000Z	sebsebseb	QueeenZ	ah yes partition mess's
2010-04-26T20:44:00.000Z	sebsebseb	QueeenZ	been there done that a few times
2010-04-26T20:44:00.000Z	QueeenZ	sebsebseb	yep... i just never really understood the difference between primary, extended and logical partitions.. (shame on me..)
2010-04-26T20:45:00.000Z	sebsebseb	QueeenZ	I sort of understand it I think,  primary main partitions.  logical not so important ones.  and then the extended is when you have if  I remember correctly more than four partitions.
2010-04-26T20:46:00.000Z	QueeenZ	sebsebseb	right, extended is just a container, logical goes into that container and primary is without/outside the extended
2010-04-26T20:46:00.000Z	sebsebseb	QueeenZ	yeah basically I guess
2010-04-26T20:47:00.000Z	QueeenZ	sebsebseb	i hate it when i delete a partition and then i have this unallocated space between partitions and i can't really use them until they're next to each other..
2010-04-26T20:48:00.000Z	sebsebseb	QueeenZ	what I tend to get is well a tiny bit of unalloacted space that has to be unalloacted space, unless I make like a 4mb SWAP which is rather pointless
