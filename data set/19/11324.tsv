2006-02-28T07:53:00.000Z	keithhhhhhhhh		Ill read the wiki
2006-02-28T07:54:00.000Z	keithhhhhhhhh		khan - Im losing interest in ubuntu such a hassle installing software, I guess that is the reason linux cant seem to catch on
2006-02-28T07:56:00.000Z	keithhhhhhhhh		what does Sudo stand for?
2006-02-28T07:57:00.000Z	keithhhhhhhhh		ah hehehe I was right thanks
2006-02-28T07:57:00.000Z	dooglus	keithhhhhhhhh	substitute user do
2006-02-28T08:19:00.000Z	dooglus	keithhhhhhhhh	ls -R is recursive
2006-02-28T08:19:00.000Z	dooglus	keithhhhhhhhh	but for searching, try "find"
2006-02-28T08:21:00.000Z	dooglus	keithhhhhhhhh	just try "find" on its own.  it takes a million options, but works without any
2006-02-28T08:33:00.000Z	dooglus	keithhhhhhhhh	(sudo) runs a command as root (apt-get) which manages packages (install) and installs a package called (libstdc++5)
2006-02-28T08:34:00.000Z	keithhhhhhhhh	dooglus	ok I mostly understood but why is libstdc++5 on my computer but not installed
2006-02-28T08:35:00.000Z	dooglus	keithhhhhhhhh	it's not on your computer - the command will download it (or take it from the CD if it's on the CD) and install it
2006-02-28T08:35:00.000Z	dooglus	keithhhhhhhhh	apt-get is a downloader and installer all-in-one
2006-02-28T08:35:00.000Z	keithhhhhhhhh	dooglus	- oh wow its fast for getting from cd or net
2006-02-28T08:37:00.000Z	dooglus	keithhhhhhhhh	that's what's nice about apt-get - it can access thousands of packages, all neatly arranged on the ubuntu servers.  you don't have to do all the steps you need to do on windows: (track down a web page, then find the download link, then save it to disk, find it on disk, run it, click 'next' 15 times)
2006-02-28T08:37:00.000Z	dooglus	keithhhhhhhhh	apt-get uses the file /etc/apt/sources.list - that file tells it which repositories to use
2006-02-28T08:38:00.000Z	dooglus	keithhhhhhhhh	apt-get is a debian thing
2006-02-28T08:38:00.000Z	dooglus	keithhhhhhhhh	ubuntu is a descendant of debian
2006-02-28T08:39:00.000Z	dooglus	keithhhhhhhhh	all linux distributions have something like apt-get I think.  but most use .rpm packages instead of .deb packages.  I don't really know what the difference is, if there is any difference.
