2009-02-12T19:33:00.000Z	heatmzzr	hateball	can i install 64 bit ubuntu without completely distroying other data?
2009-02-12T19:25:00.000Z	heatmzzr	hateball	64bit
2009-02-12T19:25:00.000Z	hateball	heatmzzr	I'd have installed the 64-bit version instead. Works a charm
2009-02-12T19:26:00.000Z	hateball	heatmzzr	Even Flash and the Java plugin are 64-bit these days so
2009-02-12T19:33:00.000Z	hateball	heatmzzr	Well if you put /home on it's partition you can keep that. / will get overwritten tho
2009-02-12T19:34:00.000Z	hateball	heatmzzr	if you specifically tell the installer to keep /home, that is... not doing a guided install
2009-02-12T19:34:00.000Z	heatmzzr	hateball	best to just wipe it out and restart anyway right, fresh everything?
2009-02-12T19:35:00.000Z	hateball	heatmzzr	if it's a brand new install, yeah. Takes like 20 minutes anyhow :)
2009-02-12T19:35:00.000Z	hateball	heatmzzr	I suggest making a separate /home partition when/if you do so tho
2009-02-12T19:36:00.000Z	heatmzzr	hateball	not that, just all the extra stuff. Ive been considering getting rid of winblows all together as I no longer use it so maybe a good time to do it all over... damn though, i got alot on these drives\
2009-02-12T19:37:00.000Z	hateball	heatmzzr	backup whatever data you need to an external source if possible, wipe the legacy OS and start anew :)
2009-02-12T19:39:00.000Z	hateball	heatmzzr	ext4 is stable, but the 8.10 kernel doesnt have it. So you'd have to go for 9.04 alpha if you want it
2009-02-12T19:48:00.000Z	heatmzzr	hateball	width says 64bit.... is that what i was looking for?
2009-02-12T19:50:00.000Z	hateball	heatmzzr	yeah
2009-02-12T19:51:00.000Z	hateball	heatmzzr	It's up to you really. Use 64-bit which works perfectly fine for me and many others, or hold on to old technology and mess about with PAE kernels...
2009-02-12T19:52:00.000Z	heatmzzr	hateball	I just wanted to be sure i could run 64bit. Which by the looks of things here I can... thanks man
2009-02-12T19:54:00.000Z	hateball	heatmzzr	also, the live-cd will tell you right away if it doesnt like your cpu :)
2009-02-12T19:56:00.000Z	heatmzzr	hateball	it will like it fine, gonna try 64bit and see how it goes.. I think april is scheduled release date of stable ext4
2009-02-12T19:56:00.000Z	hateball	heatmzzr	you can always convert to ext4 later on anyhow
