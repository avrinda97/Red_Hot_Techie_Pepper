2009-12-21T00:13:00.000Z	SAM_theman		How do I get my xorg.conf file in ubuntu 9.10?
2009-12-21T00:14:00.000Z	jmyers	SAM_theman	/etc/X11/xorg.conf
2009-12-21T00:14:00.000Z	SAM_theman	jmyers	yes but its not in there
2009-12-21T00:15:00.000Z	SAM_theman	jmyers	we tried it on live as well as installed and its empty
2009-12-21T00:15:00.000Z	SAM_theman	jmyers	also the /etc/X11 has no xorg.conf file by default
2009-12-21T00:15:00.000Z	jmyers	SAM_theman	what do you need the xorg.conf file for?  I've read several troubleshooting docs that tells me to delete it if I can't get X to load.
2009-12-21T00:16:00.000Z	jmyers	SAM_theman	therefore, x WILL load without it, with default settings.
2009-12-21T00:16:00.000Z	SAM_theman	jmyers	to increase the resolution from 800x600 to 1024x768
2009-12-21T00:16:00.000Z	SAM_theman	jmyers	mind you Im on a tosh laptop
2009-12-21T00:17:00.000Z	jmyers	SAM_theman	use System>Preferences>Display
2009-12-21T00:17:00.000Z	SAM_theman	jmyers	there is no restricted drivers its blank
2009-12-21T00:17:00.000Z	jmyers	SAM_theman	uugh, ati video card?
2009-12-21T00:18:00.000Z	SAM_theman	jmyers	trident
2009-12-21T00:19:00.000Z	jmyers	SAM_theman	not sure I can help you any further my man.  Have you searched synaptic for any trident video drivers?
2009-12-21T00:19:00.000Z	SAM_theman	jmyers	nope, thx anyway
2009-12-21T00:23:00.000Z	SAM_theman	jmyers	its installed by defalut
2009-12-21T00:26:00.000Z	SAM_theman	jmyers	But going back to my main question which was "why is there no xorg.conf file in the X11 directory?"
2009-12-21T00:26:00.000Z	SAM_theman	jmyers	in 9.04 there was an "xorg.conf" file in the X11 directory
2009-12-21T00:26:00.000Z	jmyers	SAM_theman	I don't have an answer to that question.  I know trolling about in here the last couple weeks, you aren't the only one who doesn't have xorg.conf after a fresh install.
