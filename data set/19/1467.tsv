2012-05-12T20:00:00.000Z	Darkenvy		I'm trying to use gnome classic but the Unity bar keeps coming up unless I log into Gnome classic No Effects
2012-05-12T20:00:00.000Z	Darkenvy		All the sources on the internet state that I shouldnt have a problem. well more of they dont provide a solution because my problem is unique XD
2012-05-12T20:01:00.000Z	Darkenvy		Is it safe to uninstall unity altogether on ubuntu 12.04?
2012-05-12T20:01:00.000Z	Darkenvy		windows blinds?
2012-05-12T20:02:00.000Z	Darkenvy		I believe your in the wrong channel for that though my friend
2012-05-12T20:02:00.000Z	Bsims	Darkenvy	heh apt-get install kde... or lubuntu and not select it
2012-05-12T20:02:00.000Z	Darkenvy	Bsims	I dont want KDE or LXDE
2012-05-12T20:03:00.000Z	Bsims	Darkenvy	then install gnome panel
2012-05-12T20:03:00.000Z	Darkenvy	Bsims	I have gnome-panel installed. I get the correct gnome classic as it looks in ubuntu 10.04. However the Unity bar ALSO appears
2012-05-12T20:03:00.000Z	Darkenvy		every guide and video online shows that the unity bar doesnt appear but it does on my computer
2012-05-12T20:04:00.000Z	Bsims	Darkenvy	install gnome fallback
2012-05-12T20:04:00.000Z	Bsims		its the classic gnome
2012-05-12T20:04:00.000Z	Darkenvy		I have fallback installed
2012-05-12T20:05:00.000Z	Darkenvy	Bsims	classic gnome is up and running but Unity overlaps it. I have unity on top of my peanut butter
2012-05-12T20:05:00.000Z	Darkenvy		I have watched 6 videos on youtube and they all show that unity wont come up on 12. but on mine it does
2012-05-12T20:05:00.000Z	Darkenvy		(for installing Gnome classic/fallback)
2012-05-12T20:05:00.000Z	Bsims	Darkenvy	try uninstalling it?
2012-05-12T20:06:00.000Z	Darkenvy		thats what Im asking :). if its safe to uninstall unity on 12. or if its critical to the desktop build
2012-05-12T20:06:00.000Z	Bsims	Darkenvy	try uninstalling it... it will tell you what packages it will break if any
