2009-01-15T06:59:00.000Z	dmi3on		hi all, i dont know exactly what i need and how to do it i have at work win vista and home ubuntu how do i set up ubuntu so i can control vista at office (in office computer just connect to a router no server)
2009-01-15T07:01:00.000Z	dmi3on		:(
2009-01-15T07:02:00.000Z	dmi3on		is there any way to do it with out configuring router ?>
2009-01-15T07:03:00.000Z	h4mx0r	dmi3on	you can do a reverse connection
2009-01-15T07:03:00.000Z	h4mx0r	dmi3on	I'd suggest nx or vnc reverse connection to home
2009-01-15T07:04:00.000Z	h4mx0r	dmi3on	its not a very good fix but would give you a graphical remote desktop
2009-01-15T07:05:00.000Z	h4mx0r	dmi3on	it means the system behind the firewall connects outside to the other system
2009-01-15T07:05:00.000Z	h4mx0r	dmi3on	rather than you connecting into the server the server connects to the client
2009-01-15T07:08:00.000Z	dmi3on	h4mx0r	how hard is to set up nx or vnc reverse to set up ? i need to run one only one program in vista from ubuntu thats all
2009-01-15T07:09:00.000Z	h4mx0r	dmi3on	try this http://www.nomachine.com/ just set the vista machine as server and have it connect out to you every 10-20  minutes or so then you run the client at home and get a nicely compressed remote desktop
2009-01-15T07:11:00.000Z	dmi3on	h4mx0r	thx  how save is it ?
2009-01-15T07:13:00.000Z	h4mx0r	dmi3on	the only problem is if your ip changes but if on the client side at home you install this other app it reports to a static site online what your ip is so the server connects to that server to see where you are
2009-01-15T07:14:00.000Z	dmi3on	h4mx0r	what other application ?
2009-01-15T07:15:00.000Z	h4mx0r	dmi3on	well I read this nx guide and it mentioned a place.. trying to find it
2009-01-15T07:16:00.000Z	dmi3on	h4mx0r	thank you very much
2009-01-15T07:16:00.000Z	h4mx0r	dmi3on	try no-ip.com that will give you a dns name to use instead of an ip
2009-01-15T07:17:00.000Z	h4mx0r	dmi3on	its not the one I was recommended to use but it gets the job done
2009-01-15T07:17:00.000Z	dmi3on	h4mx0r	will you be here tomorrow so i can ask you more questions ?
2009-01-15T07:21:00.000Z	dmi3on	h4mx0r	can i PM you ?
