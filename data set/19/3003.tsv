2009-12-28T15:27:00.000Z	Xaero	mka	you are severely misinformed
2009-12-28T15:27:00.000Z	mka	Xaero	huh?
2009-12-28T15:27:00.000Z	mka	Xaero	severely misinformed?
2009-12-28T15:28:00.000Z	Xaero	mka	its true you cant directly convert between the two filesystems
2009-12-28T15:28:00.000Z	Xaero	mka	however, you don't have to lose all your data to do it
2009-12-28T15:28:00.000Z	mka	Xaero	bring facts forward next time that acting like a player hater
2009-12-28T15:29:00.000Z	Xaero	mka	its factual that you can now safely resize ntfs partitions and migrate the data to ext3
2009-12-28T15:30:00.000Z	mka	Xaero	can you CONVERT ntfs to EXT3 without losing data inside?
2009-12-28T15:30:00.000Z	Xaero	mka	yes
2009-12-28T15:30:00.000Z	mka	Xaero	how?
2009-12-28T15:31:00.000Z	Xaero	mka	not direct conversion, but by resizing the NTFS partition bit by bit and copying the data to the ext3 counterpart
2009-12-28T15:31:00.000Z	mka	Xaero	I mean DIRECT convertion
2009-12-28T15:31:00.000Z	mka	Xaero	I have been doing what you are saying since Warty
2009-12-28T15:32:00.000Z	Xaero	mka	thats just not possible, I mean theorhetically it could be done since we know enough about both filesystems, but it would be an incredibly delicate process
2009-12-28T15:32:00.000Z	mka	Xaero	it's an insult to say I am severely misinformed
2009-12-28T15:32:00.000Z	Xaero	mka	you said it couldn't be done without losing all his data, which was wrong
2009-12-28T15:32:00.000Z	mka	Xaero	I meant DIRECT CONVERSION
2009-12-28T15:33:00.000Z	Xaero	mka	this is silly, drop it
2009-12-28T15:33:00.000Z	mka	Xaero	you the silly one
