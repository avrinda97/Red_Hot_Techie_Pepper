2006-09-24T06:45:00.000Z	chuckyp	new2linx	people are talking about ubuntu and asking questions for help
2006-09-24T06:47:00.000Z	chuckyp	new2linx	well you type their name and then say what you want it will hilight on their screen.  after a few letters of their name you should be able to hit tab to auto complete the name.
2006-09-24T06:48:00.000Z	chuckyp	new2linx	what program are you trying to install
2006-09-24T06:53:00.000Z	chuckyp	new2linx	you did what?

2006-09-24T07:01:00.000Z	chuckyp	new2linx	nah hold on
2006-09-24T07:02:00.000Z	chuckyp	new2linx	click on the window that says chuckyp, I'll talk to you there real quick since this is overwhelming
2006-09-24T07:03:00.000Z	chuckyp	new2linx	do you see the window still?
2006-09-24T07:06:00.000Z	new2linx	chuckyp	why isn't anyone talking to me in the tabs that are on the left side of xchat?
2006-09-24T07:06:00.000Z	chuckyp	new2linx	well I was talking to you in a dialog but you weren't responding.
2006-09-24T07:07:00.000Z	chuckyp	new2linx	the buttons at the bottom should show the different channels you are in.  If you right click someones name you can open a dialog with them.
2006-09-24T07:07:00.000Z	chuckyp	new2linx	I think that is what you are looking for.
