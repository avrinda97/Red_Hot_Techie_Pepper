2010-10-07T12:37:00.000Z	tiox		I don't thi nk any of this matters.
2010-10-07T12:38:00.000Z	tiox		Yeah.
2010-10-07T12:39:00.000Z	tiox		It's made for a disk, but I prefer USB because it's almost failproof.
2010-10-07T12:41:00.000Z	tiox		Meg is most likely a girl,.
2010-10-07T12:41:00.000Z	tiox		:P
2010-10-07T12:41:00.000Z	tiox		Much like your min spec check.
2010-10-07T12:42:00.000Z	tiox		Hmmm.
2010-10-07T12:42:00.000Z	tiox		An uninstall doesn't remove config files.
2010-10-07T12:42:00.000Z	tiox		Except for a COMPLETE uninstall.
2010-10-07T12:43:00.000Z	tiox		A girl? Wanting to try Linux? OMFG!! [/sarcasm]
2010-10-07T12:43:00.000Z	Gnea	tiox	enough.
2010-10-07T12:47:00.000Z	Gnea	tiox	it's a trend of toshibas, unfortunately. there's always virtualbox.
2010-10-07T12:48:00.000Z	Gnea	tiox	what are you trying to do, exactly?
2010-10-07T12:49:00.000Z	Gnea	tiox	if it doesn't, you could always use the cd drive to boot from usb
2010-12-31T11:59:00.000Z	Gnea	tiox	pretty sure kubuntu uses adept
2010-12-31T12:01:00.000Z	Gnea	tiox	ox3a: actually, you can run many KDE applications just fine in Ubuntu, as it will automatically install kde library support for them. the applications that will likely fail are those requiring the K environment to be running
2010-12-31T12:05:00.000Z	Gnea	tiox	there are KDE tools he can use in place of them
2010-12-31T12:06:00.000Z	Gnea	tiox	indeed, but even then it's not going to run gnome applets and such
2010-12-31T12:15:00.000Z	Gnea	tiox	don't forget, the kubuntu-desktop will actually install kdm
