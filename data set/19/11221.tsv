2006-03-08T08:24:00.000Z	perry		and it will run on an xbox
2006-03-08T08:24:00.000Z	perry		as opposed to ps2buntu
2006-03-08T08:25:00.000Z	perry		actually, i was wondering
2006-03-08T08:25:00.000Z	perry		my workplace has draconian proxy filtering rules...i can't use synaptic at work
2006-03-08T08:25:00.000Z	perry		i think its because its trying to check so many archives more or less simultaneously
2006-03-08T08:25:00.000Z	Josh43	perry	ssh tunnel ;P
2006-03-08T08:26:00.000Z	perry	Josh43	how would i do that?
2006-03-08T08:27:00.000Z	Josh43	perry	there is always a way.. I have the entire thing locked down, but I portscanned my own machine and found one port: 23.. set the home ssh server to port 23; tunnel all day long :)
2006-03-08T08:31:00.000Z	perry	Josh43	would you mind pointing me towards a decent tutorial for setting up ssh so i can do my thing at work?
2006-03-08T08:31:00.000Z	perry	Josh43	or helping me get it setup
2006-03-08T08:32:00.000Z	perry	Josh43	thanks :)
2006-03-08T08:33:00.000Z	Josh43	perry	Step 1: Turn on something on your home pc that lets you find out every port someone is hitting; I did it with the router, but that's tricky.. some sort of honeypot would work
2006-03-08T08:34:00.000Z	Josh43	perry	Step 2: Run a port scanner from work on your home machine; let it do all 65k ports
2006-03-08T08:34:00.000Z	Josh43	perry	Dunno about nessus.. stopped doing active hacking a few years ago
2006-03-08T08:35:00.000Z	Josh43	perry	Step 3: Go home, collect the logs - see what came through
2006-03-08T08:36:00.000Z	Josh43	perry	Step 4: Set up the ssh server on that port, and make sure you set it to allow tunnelling (check the ubuntuforums or wiki)
2006-03-08T08:36:00.000Z	Josh43	perry	Step 5: Use Putty from work to ssh tunnel through your home connection :)
2006-03-08T08:37:00.000Z	perry	Josh43	thanks, i'll give it a go
2006-03-08T08:38:00.000Z	Josh43	perry	Hope it works out and you learn a bunch :)
