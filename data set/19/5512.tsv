2008-06-15T11:46:00.000Z	airstrikeivanov		Hello everyone. Why does my sound not work?
2008-06-15T11:48:00.000Z	airstrikeivanov		Does anyone know how to make my sound work?
2008-06-15T11:48:00.000Z	mycroftiv	airstrikeivanov	open a terminal and type cat /proc/asound/cards to find out if the kernel sees your hardware
2008-06-15T11:50:00.000Z	airstrikeivanov	mycroftiv	It finds two cards: a Live! 7.1 and an Intel ICH5.
2008-06-15T11:52:00.000Z	mycroftiv	airstrikeivanov	ok thats a good start, you should be able to get sound working since iits found your hardware, theres probably something about having two cards available thats confusing alsa or pulseaudio. pulseaudio is new and i admit i dont know much about how to set it up
2008-06-15T11:52:00.000Z	airstrikeivanov	mycroftiv	How do I fix the problem for ALSA?
2008-06-15T11:55:00.000Z	mycroftiv	airstrikeivanov	in the GUI volume control program under the file menu is an option "change device" that should show you different possible sound pipelines
2008-06-15T11:55:00.000Z	airstrikeivanov	mycroftiv	I tried setting it to ALSA and no sound came out.
2008-06-15T11:57:00.000Z	mycroftiv	airstrikeivanov	cat /proc/asound/modules shows what kernel sound modules are loaded, that should show something that matches your sound card
2008-06-15T11:58:00.000Z	airstrikeivanov	mycroftiv	0 snd_ca0106; 1 snd_intel8x0
2008-06-15T11:59:00.000Z	mycroftiv	airstrikeivanov	there are two directions to head in debugging: the kernel module configuration/codec options, and the userland pulseaudio settings.
2008-06-15T11:59:00.000Z	airstrikeivanov	mycroftiv	i have no idea what youre talking about,
2008-06-15T12:00:00.000Z	mycroftiv	airstrikeivanov	im sorry, sound debugging can get kind of technical, ive actually been doing a lot of it lately, the kernel module loaded needs to match your card and be configured with the right codec, and also the pulseaudio sound daemon has to feed stuff into the correct alsa pipeline
2008-06-15T12:01:00.000Z	airstrikeivanov	mycroftiv	i'm a simple webhoster, you'll have to walk me through it.
2008-06-15T12:01:00.000Z	mycroftiv	airstrikeivanov	id say try some shortcuts first: have you searched the ubuntu web forums for the name of your soundcard, or google searched it + linux?
2008-06-15T12:08:00.000Z	mycroftiv	airstrikeivanov	thats a very common audio controller, you should be able to find a lot of information on it, it used to be a lot of people needed to set it to 'triple stack' in their module configuration, but that was a few versions ago
2008-06-15T12:10:00.000Z	mycroftiv	airstrikeivanov	aha -- found you this via google: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=791028 its marked solved and its your chipset
2008-06-15T12:16:00.000Z	mycroftiv	airstrikeivanov	im looking the kernel source right now, relevant info such as: The ac97_quirk option is used to enable/override the workaround for
2008-06-15T12:45:00.000Z	mycroftiv	airstrikeivanov	assuming its an AC'97 quirk thats the issue, you might be able to fix with adding line in the /etc/modprobe.d/options file, (might need to update your initramfs after that) as described in some of those links we gave you
