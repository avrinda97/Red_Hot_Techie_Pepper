2005-09-27T09:51:00.000Z	r0bnyc		i just finish installing ubuntu and im trying to install mc but it said it cant find it
2005-09-27T09:52:00.000Z	robbkidd	r0bnyc	Have you "enabled" the Universe respository?
2005-09-27T09:52:00.000Z	r0bnyc	robbkidd	no im just using the default settings right now
2005-09-27T09:53:00.000Z	robbkidd	r0bnyc	Therein lies your problem. mc is a package in the "universe" repository. You can turn this on in System -> Administration -> Update Manager. (Or, if you're comfortable with a text editor, uncomment the "universe" lines in /etc/apt/sources.list")
2005-09-27T09:58:00.000Z	r0bnyc	robbkidd	so i can check them all ?
2005-09-27T09:58:00.000Z	robbkidd	r0bnyc	Sorry, check all of what?
2005-09-27T09:58:00.000Z	r0bnyc	robbkidd	repository from update manager
2005-09-27T09:59:00.000Z	robbkidd	r0bnyc	Sure. S'what I did.
2005-09-27T10:00:00.000Z	robbkidd	r0bnyc	Not necessary for getting mc installed, but if this is your desktop, enabled all of those sources gives you the most options.
2005-09-27T10:00:00.000Z	r0bnyc	robbkidd	yes thanks
2005-09-27T10:02:00.000Z	r0bnyc	robbkidd	thanks for your help btw do you know where i can get nice gnome themes ? (complete with icons or so) "?
2005-09-27T10:04:00.000Z	robbkidd	r0bnyc	Indeed. art.gnome.org and gnome-look.org.  Bonus: install the "gnome-art" package which will automatically download previews of themes at art.gnome.org and install what you select.
2005-09-27T10:04:00.000Z	r0bnyc	robbkidd	thanks again . what themes do you use
2005-09-27T10:05:00.000Z	robbkidd	r0bnyc	I'm ambivalent on eyecandy.  I've got Human up with the graphic icon set.  The whole graphite theme suite is rather nice, though.
2005-09-27T10:06:00.000Z	robbkidd	r0bnyc	Graphite is available at gnome-look.org, I think. Not through art.gnome.org or the gnome-art utility.
2005-09-27T10:07:00.000Z	robbkidd	r0bnyc	Yep. http://www.gnome-look.org/content/show.php?content=26757 Another bonus: the graphite icon set includes the "proper" Firefox and Thunderbird icons.
2005-09-27T12:13:00.000Z	r0bnyc	robbkidd	thanks
2005-09-27T12:16:00.000Z	robbkidd	r0bnyc	What's this about new human?
2005-09-27T12:17:00.000Z	r0bnyc	robbkidd	looks nicer man
