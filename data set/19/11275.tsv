2006-03-13T08:16:00.000Z	bigfoot1	Healot	i'm looking for input ability, not viewing ability. I can view japanese fonts. I just want to be able to type them in my keyboard.
2006-03-13T08:18:00.000Z	bigfoot1	Healot	can you give me a simple im?
2006-03-13T08:19:00.000Z	bigfoot1	Healot	that's why i asked, which IME has an easy setup?
2006-03-13T08:30:00.000Z	bigfoot1	Healot	canna is in repository. i don't know if i stil need to do alien on it
2006-03-13T08:31:00.000Z	bigfoot1	Healot	how come you said that i had to do "alien" on them?
2006-03-13T08:31:00.000Z	Healot	bigfoot1	: about setting up canna... it is very tedious,,, I don't really like discussing that :(
2006-03-13T08:31:00.000Z	Healot	bigfoot1	: that was not for you :)
2006-03-13T08:39:00.000Z	Healot	bigfoot1	: anyways, try to understand this >> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/JapaneseInputHowto
2006-06-17T06:41:00.000Z	bigfoot1	Healot	it does, or it did, when i installed xubuntu-desktop alongside my ubunu-desktop
2006-06-17T06:41:00.000Z	bigfoot1	Healot	aptitude would have made removed the xubuntu apps a lot easier
