2011-05-01T01:45:00.000Z	ebiester		Howdy all. My xorg.conf is broken without backup. I want to regenerate, but the only thing I saw while googling was uninstalling xorg and reinstalling/dpkg-reconfigure. Is there a less drastic option?
2011-05-01T01:45:00.000Z	ohsix	ebiester	move it out of the way
2011-05-01T01:46:00.000Z	ohsix	ebiester	you shouldn't need an xorg.conf
2011-05-01T01:46:00.000Z	ebiester	ohsix	I'm currently running without any xorg.conf. :)
2011-05-01T01:46:00.000Z	ohsix	ebiester	welcome to this century ;] what do you need a .conf for?
2011-05-01T01:48:00.000Z	ebiester	ohsix	I have a new laptop that has two separate video cards, so I can't tell if it's running on the intel or the nvidia chipset right now. However, when I upgraded to 11.04, I got a popup that said my video card wasn't powerful enough to run unity.
2011-05-01T01:49:00.000Z	ohsix	ebiester	ok
2011-05-01T01:50:00.000Z	ohsix	ebiester	either video card you are using should work with unity, something else is going on
2011-05-01T01:52:00.000Z	ebiester	ohsix	Sometimes I think a decade+ of unix experience gets in my way with ubuntu. :) -- what would be the best route for debugging this?
2011-05-01T01:52:00.000Z	ohsix	ebiester	well, first, open a terminal and paste the output of glxinfo to paste.ubuntu.com
2011-05-01T01:54:00.000Z	ebiester	ohsix	http://paste.ubuntu.com/601467/
2011-05-01T01:57:00.000Z	ohsix	ebiester	ok so it's not using either of your video cards, but vesa or something; did you use nomodeset when you booted or otherwise have to do anything special to get it to start?
2011-05-01T01:58:00.000Z	ebiester	ohsix	The nvidia is Nvidia GeForce GT 540M -- I had to look it up. But the series of events is. 1. Install 10.10. 2. try to install the proprietary extension, which kills X. 3. After trying to get the open source nv or intel working, delete xorg.conf. 4. Upgrade to Natty
2011-05-01T02:00:00.000Z	ohsix	ebiester	hm ok so you need to nuke the bits of the nvidia driver left around, did you install the .bin from nvidia or something from a package manager?
2011-05-01T02:03:00.000Z	ebiester	ohsix	I installed it from the popup in ubuntu. (Sorry, that was a few weeks ago, I don't have the exact other than remember it suggesting proprietary drivers.) I got rid of all of that, but natty seems to have brought some of it back. Do I just purge all of this? http://paste.ubuntu.com/601469/
2011-05-01T02:04:00.000Z	ohsix	ebiester	ah ok that was probably jockey and it shouldn't have broken anything you can't just remove, sec
2011-05-01T02:07:00.000Z	ebiester	ohsix	If you said something, could you repeat it? I just accidentally cleared the window.
2011-05-01T02:11:00.000Z	ohsix	ebiester	let me think a bit, and i didn't say anything
2011-05-01T02:11:00.000Z	ebiester	ohsix	no worries. Thanks. :)
