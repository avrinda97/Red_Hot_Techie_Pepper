2008-04-26T06:07:00.000Z	cardstroker		pelo, correction, "fatal server error, No valid font path could be found."
2008-04-26T06:07:00.000Z	cardstroker		nothing but Ubuntu, a clean load.
2008-04-26T06:07:00.000Z	CITguy	cardstroker	have you tried "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg"?
2008-04-26T06:08:00.000Z	cardstroker	CITguy	will try.
2008-04-26T06:10:00.000Z	cardstroker	CITguy	"No Xserver known for your video hardware."
2008-04-26T06:11:00.000Z	CITguy	cardstroker	how have you installed Ubuntu?
2008-04-26T06:12:00.000Z	cardstroker	CITguy	from a server ISO that I downloaded and burned, installation went fine untill I tried to install the gui.
2008-04-26T06:12:00.000Z	CITguy	cardstroker	try "sudo tasksel" and choose "gnome-desktop"
2008-04-26T06:13:00.000Z	CITguy	cardstroker	sorry, "Ubuntu desktop"
2008-04-26T06:25:00.000Z	cardstroker	CITguy	I am selecting my mouse setup, I use USB, which should I seleect? /dev/psaux or ttys0 or tts0 or gpmdata?
2008-04-26T06:26:00.000Z	CITguy	cardstroker	try gpmdata
2008-04-26T06:35:00.000Z	cardstroker	CITguy	I get a screen full when I execute startx, but it boils down to a fatal server error "no valid font path could be found."
2008-04-26T06:40:00.000Z	cardstroker	CITguy	I get "fontpath could not be found" when I xecute startx.
2008-04-26T06:41:00.000Z	CITguy	cardstroker	I'm looking into the error. I'll let you know what I find.
2008-04-26T06:42:00.000Z	cardstroker	CITguy	thank you, I'll provide more info if necessary.
2008-04-26T06:43:00.000Z	CITguy	cardstroker	try "sudo apt-get install xfonts-100dpi-transcoded xfonts-75dpi-transcoded"
2008-04-26T06:44:00.000Z	CITguy	cardstroker	or "sudo apt-get install xfonts* "
