2008-08-22T22:33:00.000Z	macd	juanan	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=338178   has some people using your card, and one with the same chipset (which means it is the same driver) and they haver had some success, make sure to read it all the way through before starting
2008-08-22T22:34:00.000Z	juanan	macd	OK, thanks, I'm reading now
2008-08-22T22:34:00.000Z	macd	juanan	though you can skip trying to configure your kernel, just do the things post 5 mentions aside from that, as well as making sure you have the proper line in modprobe
2008-08-22T22:36:00.000Z	juanan	macd	Thanks
2008-08-22T22:37:00.000Z	juanan	macd	My dmesg: [   50.222993] mt352_read_register: readreg error (reg=127, ret==-5)
2008-08-22T22:39:00.000Z	macd	juanan	I'm not going to be able to help you fix it, I dont have that specific card, might I suggest asking more later here, or posting to that forum thread
2008-08-22T22:40:00.000Z	juanan	macd	Ok, thanks.
