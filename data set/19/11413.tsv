2006-04-03T09:36:00.000Z	WebMaven		So, any advice/help with my scanner?
2006-04-03T09:36:00.000Z	slavik	WebMaven	plug your scanner in and reboot
2006-04-03T09:36:00.000Z	WebMaven	slavik	reboot?
2006-04-03T09:37:00.000Z	WebMaven	slavik	will I have to do that every time I want to plug it in?
2006-04-03T09:37:00.000Z	slavik	WebMaven	maybe, but try it
2006-04-03T09:38:00.000Z	WebMaven	slavik	Do you know why this is necessary, given that the device is showing up in the device manager?
2006-04-03T09:39:00.000Z	slavik	WebMaven	I dunno, just try it
2006-04-03T09:39:00.000Z	slavik	WebMaven	if it works, then you know there is something to do with proper detection and such
2006-04-03T09:39:00.000Z	WebMaven	slavik	OK. see y'all in a bit.
2006-04-03T10:04:00.000Z	WebMaven	slavik	still no joy after rebooting.
2006-04-03T10:04:00.000Z	slavik	WebMaven	then I dunno what to say ...
2006-04-03T10:04:00.000Z	WebMaven	slavik	is there something I should have installed or configured?
2006-04-03T10:04:00.000Z	slavik	WebMaven	from what I know, it should work
2006-04-03T10:08:00.000Z	WebMaven	slavik	OK, so how do I diagnose this further?
2006-04-03T10:09:00.000Z	slavik	WebMaven	I have no idea ...
2006-04-03T10:09:00.000Z	slavik	WebMaven	disconnect your scanner
2006-04-03T10:10:00.000Z	slavik	WebMaven	then do 'dmsg' from terminal
2006-04-03T10:12:00.000Z	WebMaven	slavik	there are detailed instructions for my scanner on this page, which I just found: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ScanningHowTo
2006-04-03T10:13:00.000Z	slavik	WebMaven	even better :D
