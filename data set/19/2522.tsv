2010-10-10T07:07:00.000Z	Killaklown		anyone having problems with nvidia drivers?
2010-10-10T07:07:00.000Z	Killaklown		my video looks jacked
2010-10-10T07:07:00.000Z	Mathuin	Killaklown	I'm not having trouble, and I'm using somewhat bleeding edge drivers.
2010-10-10T07:07:00.000Z	Killaklown	Mathuin	where u get ur drivers from?
2010-10-10T07:08:00.000Z	Killaklown	Mathuin	ubuntu's repo?
2010-10-10T07:09:00.000Z	Mathuin	Killaklown	http://ppa.launchpad.net/ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates/ubuntu lucid
2010-10-10T07:09:00.000Z	Mathuin		That's the repo I have in Synaptic.
2010-10-10T07:09:00.000Z	Killaklown		why that one?
2010-10-10T07:09:00.000Z	Killaklown		instead of the built in nvidia proprietary drivers?
2010-10-10T07:09:00.000Z	Mathuin	Killaklown	I was trying to determine if the problems I was seeing in Civilization V via Steam were due to drivers or not.
2010-10-10T07:10:00.000Z	Killaklown	Mathuin	when I book I get like a scrambled, garbled screen
2010-10-10T07:10:00.000Z	Killaklown		*boot
2010-10-10T07:11:00.000Z	Mathuin	Killaklown	wow, that sucks.  You might want to disable them and try the other drivers.
