2010-10-24T11:28:00.000Z	geboy		hi, i have a problem with ubuntu 10.10.
2010-10-24T11:29:00.000Z	geboy		i installed it and first thing, the screen dont fit. and everytime i log in with the username and pass i made when in instalation, it kicked me back to the login screen.
2010-10-24T11:30:00.000Z	geboy		can somebody give me a clue on what to do?
2010-10-24T11:30:00.000Z	Diamondcite	geboy	Sounds like X is crashing... I wonder if the right drivers were used..
2010-10-24T11:30:00.000Z	geboy	Diamondcite	hmm...it might be. coz i'm using old machine
2010-10-24T11:32:00.000Z	geboy	Diamondcite	how can i fix it? i'm using ECS P4M800-M mobo. 512 DDR1 Ram. with onboard vga.
2010-10-24T11:32:00.000Z	Diamondcite	geboy	ECS is a pain to work with since the company isn't around anymore!
2010-10-24T11:33:00.000Z	geboy	Diamondcite	ouch. ECS is gone? since when? geez i thought they made success here in asia
2010-10-24T11:33:00.000Z	Diamondcite	geboy	Maybe I had the wrong company in mind.. well atleast there are specs for this board this time..
2010-10-24T11:33:00.000Z	geboy	Diamondcite	okay, any idea how to fix it without changing the hardware?
2010-10-24T11:34:00.000Z	Diamondcite	geboy	The last couple of times I had to work with then I was working blind x.x
2010-10-24T11:34:00.000Z	Diamondcite	geboy	Looking up drivers for S3 Unichrome
2010-10-24T11:35:00.000Z	geboy	Diamondcite	ok. gonna try looking on ubuntu site then.
2010-10-24T11:36:00.000Z	Diamondcite	geboy	If possible I would seriously recommend getting an AGP graphic card.. ANYTHING...
2010-10-24T11:37:00.000Z	geboy	Diamondcite	actually the reason i use the onboard one was because mine is broken. T.T
2010-10-24T11:40:00.000Z	Diamondcite	geboy	Currently reading through http://ubuntu-ky.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=6648810
2010-10-24T11:40:00.000Z	Diamondcite	geboy	It relates to your driver..
2010-10-24T11:41:00.000Z	geboy	Diamondcite	ok thanks. hold on a momment, reading to it...
2010-10-24T11:42:00.000Z	Diamondcite	geboy	It links to an ubuntu help page.. it seems to still be valid to try to follow it.
