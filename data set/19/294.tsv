2012-04-26T10:47:00.000Z	P-CHAN		I want create a distro like Apodio with remaster
2012-04-26T10:48:00.000Z	P-CHAN		what is the better remastersys? UCK?
2012-04-26T10:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	P-CHAN	both are fine, there is no best or the other would die out as nobody would use it
2012-04-26T10:50:00.000Z	P-CHAN	ActionParsnip	no. For example.... Unetbootin is better than USB Creator
2012-04-26T10:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	P-CHAN	its as intelligent as asking which is better, blue or red. Neither is better. All you will get is opinion
2012-04-26T10:51:00.000Z	P-CHAN	ActionParsnip	 Blue
2012-04-26T10:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	P-CHAN	unetbootin isn't better, neither is better. That's just your opinion and nothing more
2012-04-26T10:52:00.000Z	P-CHAN	ActionParsnip	what do you do doing for live?
2012-04-26T10:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	P-CHAN	NOC engineer, how is that relevant to support?
2012-04-26T10:53:00.000Z	P-CHAN	ActionParsnip	 yes... why?
2012-04-26T10:57:00.000Z	P-CHAN	ActionParsnip	You talk as if there were no better or worse.
2012-04-26T11:08:00.000Z	P-CHAN	ActionParsnip	go se
2012-04-26T11:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	P-CHAN	you lost me
2012-04-26T11:10:00.000Z	P-CHAN	ActionParsnip	:(
2012-04-26T11:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	P-CHAN	'go se' isn't a sentence
2012-04-26T11:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	P-CHAN	simple
2012-04-26T11:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	P-CHAN	32bit will run on BOTH 64bit and 32bit. The target audience of Ubuntu is the average user. So if they are not sure, they can use the recommended and it will work
2012-04-26T11:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	P-CHAN	yeah, well the Linux standard base species RPM, not DEB....
2012-04-26T11:37:00.000Z	P-CHAN	ActionParsnip	???????
