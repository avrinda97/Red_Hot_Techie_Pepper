2005-02-07T11:14:00.000Z	hou5ton		my son just got Ubuntu on this laptop, and it has version 2.0.8 XChat, .... and I can't figure out how to get a later version ... like 2.4.x ???
2005-02-07T11:15:00.000Z	ficusplanet	hou5ton	Is something missing that you need/want?
2005-02-07T11:17:00.000Z	ficusplanet	hou5ton	Well, you could either use gaim for irc or download the latest version of xchat from xchat.org - or upgrade to hoary on march 9th.
2005-02-07T11:17:00.000Z	hou5ton	ficusplanet	well, new to this, ... but I take you mean by that, that hoary will have the later version?
2005-02-07T11:18:00.000Z	ficusplanet	hou5ton	Hoary is the next version of ubuntu.  You could upgrade to it right now, but it is a development version so it may not be as solid as what you have right now, which is referred to as "warty."
2005-02-07T11:19:00.000Z	hou5ton	ficusplanet	can i just do a root terminal and:  aptget gnucash   ??
2005-02-07T11:20:00.000Z	ficusplanet	hou5ton	You can just click computer>>synaptic package manager and search for whatever you want.
2005-02-07T11:39:00.000Z	hou5ton	ficusplanet	what I can't figure out is how to get synaptic to show me the new packages to choose from.  It's only showing me the ones I already have.  ??
2005-02-07T11:40:00.000Z	ficusplanet	hou5ton	If you go to Settings>>Repositories and then check the box that have universe in the sections, you'll have a much bigger selection.  Oh, and click reload after you check those boxes.
2005-02-07T11:43:00.000Z	hou5ton	ficusplanet	ok,..... there are two of them that do that, ... and when I check those boxes it asks if i'm sure, because the packages are unsupported..    Is that still ok?
2005-02-07T11:51:00.000Z	hou5ton	ficusplanet	for example, it brings up four gnucash packages, but when I click to mark the main one, "gnucash" for installation, it gives me four other dependencies to mark, but when I do that, it says it can't install gnucash-common because of other dependencies that are unistallable?
2005-02-07T11:53:00.000Z	ficusplanet	hou5ton	Did you click the reload button after changed the repositories?
2005-02-07T11:54:00.000Z	hou5ton	ficusplanet	should I just check all repository options in the preferences?
2005-02-07T11:57:00.000Z	hou5ton	ficusplanet	that seemed to have fixed it, ... i checked the other repository options
2005-02-07T12:03:00.000Z	hou5ton	ficusplanet	SUCCESS
2005-02-07T12:03:00.000Z	ficusplanet	hou5ton	np.  Congrats.
2005-02-07T12:23:00.000Z	ficusplanet	hou5ton	First, just run killall gnome-panel to see if it will just update after the panels reload.
2005-02-07T12:24:00.000Z	hou5ton	ficusplanet	absolutely.  thanks again
