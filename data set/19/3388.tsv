2009-12-23T01:22:00.000Z	adalal		um, anyone aware of the default webmin user and password?
2009-12-23T01:24:00.000Z	adalal		right ebox it is then
2009-12-23T01:25:00.000Z	guntbert	adalal	but be warned: ebox is no replacement for webmin at all - it insists on using only its own config files,...
2009-12-26T00:35:00.000Z	adalal	guntbert	i think it's a bit more annoying than adding/removign a line in grub2
2009-12-26T00:47:00.000Z	guntbert	adalal	please keep to the topic :-)
2009-12-26T00:51:00.000Z	guntbert	adalal	especially when I *want* to kick someone I'm glad that I cannot :-)
2009-12-26T22:49:00.000Z	guntbert	adalal	if the keyserver is unresponsive you can use any other as well - try http://pgp.mit.edu/
2009-12-26T22:50:00.000Z	guntbert	adalal	thats "a very good question" (TM)
2009-12-26T22:56:00.000Z	guntbert	adalal	you'll have to use port 11371
2009-12-26T22:57:00.000Z	adalal	guntbert	how do you set that?
2009-12-26T22:57:00.000Z	adalal	guntbert	for some reason, i dont think i can connect to that port from here for some reason
2009-12-26T22:58:00.000Z	guntbert	adalal	that might be the main issue - but for once you can d/l a key from there via the web interface
2009-12-26T22:59:00.000Z	adalal	guntbert	i just did a search string on the mit php public key server, it keeps saying 'connecting' and never connects, which is why i think it really can't connect to that port for some reason :S
2009-12-26T23:00:00.000Z	guntbert	adalal	so we assume some sort of network misconfiguration somewhere
2009-12-26T23:04:00.000Z	guntbert	adalal	did you check your settings for network proxy?
2009-12-26T23:05:00.000Z	adalal	guntbert	yeah, someone else on the network, put a block on it for soem reason... sorry for botherin u guys with that :P
2009-12-26T23:06:00.000Z	adalal	guntbert	it was part of the torrent blocking shecule
2009-12-26T23:06:00.000Z	guntbert	adalal	np - it often helps just to voice the problem :-)
2010-02-21T02:17:00.000Z	guntbert	adalal	how do you manage the rules?
