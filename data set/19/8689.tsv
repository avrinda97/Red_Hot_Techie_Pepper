2007-02-25T06:32:00.000Z	JR302GT		Why do I get a "Permission denied" when trying to run a game server?  It's in my user's folder.
2007-02-25T06:34:00.000Z	adaptr	JR302GT	for one thing, if the game server wanted to use low network sockets, your normal user would be prohibited from doing so
2007-02-25T06:34:00.000Z	JR302GT	adaptr	 Not sure what low network sockets are, but how do I get around it if that is the case?
2007-02-25T06:34:00.000Z	adaptr	JR302GT	you can't - start the server as root
2007-02-25T06:35:00.000Z	adaptr	JR302GT	many "server" services need to be run as root regardless
2007-02-25T06:35:00.000Z	JR302GT	adaptr	 How do I log into root when it's disabled?
2007-02-25T06:36:00.000Z	adaptr	JR302GT	you never "log into root" - you run a program *as* root, with sudo
2007-02-25T06:37:00.000Z	JR302GT	adaptr	 I did try that, not sure if it was done correctly though!  I got into the correct folder and typed sudo ./server-bin and it returns a different error...command not found.
2007-02-25T06:37:00.000Z	JR302GT	adaptr	 I did that in Terminal.  Is that correct place to be?
2007-02-25T06:38:00.000Z	adaptr	JR302GT	how would I know ? I don't know what you're trying to run
2007-02-25T06:38:00.000Z	JR302GT	adaptr	 It's a game server, America's Army.
2007-02-25T06:39:00.000Z	adaptr	JR302GT	never seen it, is it linux native ? don't you need to setup a config before running the server ?
2007-02-25T06:40:00.000Z	JR302GT	adaptr	 No, it was just unzipped to a folder.  I have had it running on other versions of Linux, but having trouble here.
2007-02-25T06:40:00.000Z	adaptr	JR302GT	did you run it as user there, too ? then strace it and see what happens
2007-02-25T06:41:00.000Z	adaptr	JR302GT	ubuntu is by default a lot less forgiving than other linux distro's, where one tends to do these things as root
2007-02-25T06:41:00.000Z	JR302GT	adaptr	 I'm sorry, I have no idea what strace is.
2007-02-25T06:47:00.000Z	JR302GT	adaptr	 strace ./server-bin spit out a lot of stuff.  Should I post it here or IM?  I was using root in other versions of Linux.
2007-02-25T06:47:00.000Z	adaptr	JR302GT	if you were using root in other versions of Linux then the best you could do is enable the root account, but I would not normally recommend that - better SUID the server binary
2007-02-25T06:48:00.000Z	JR302GT	adaptr	 What is the command for that?
