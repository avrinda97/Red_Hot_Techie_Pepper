2008-01-07T16:51:00.000Z	Kyouki		im trying to run the partition program, GParted or something.. but it doesnt find anything
2008-01-07T16:51:00.000Z	Kyouki		it just keeps "scanning all devices..."
2008-01-07T16:52:00.000Z	littlebear72	Kyouki	 sounds like you have a hardware error there
2008-01-07T16:52:00.000Z	Kyouki		;_; i kinda hate the udundun more than windows already
2008-01-07T16:52:00.000Z	littlebear72	Kyouki	 if you are having it scan your hardware and find s nothting then your hard drives are not visable for some reason have you had hard drive issues lately ?
2008-01-07T16:53:00.000Z	Kyouki	littlebear72	not really, i have two 500gb samsung sata drives
2008-01-07T16:54:00.000Z	littlebear72		thats od dthen cos gparted usually sees all that are connected properly and workign fine can you see them in your post screen ? or when you enter yoru bios ?
2008-01-07T16:55:00.000Z	Kyouki	littlebear72	yeah, the HDDs work just fine, but this udundun doesnt find them
