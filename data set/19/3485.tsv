2009-07-31T13:31:00.000Z	tanners		guys how do I load menu.lis?
2009-07-31T13:31:00.000Z	tanners		lst
2009-07-31T13:32:00.000Z	tanners		err edit
2009-07-31T13:32:00.000Z	moymoy	tanners	if you want grub to read menu.lst, you'll need to reboot...
2009-07-31T13:32:00.000Z	moymoy	tanners	just edit it with any text editor .. but with root privelages
2009-07-31T13:33:00.000Z	moymoy	tanners	gksu gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst
2009-07-31T13:36:00.000Z	moymoy	tanners	post the output of `sudo fdisk -l` and also show us your menu.lst .. you can paste everything at pastebin
2009-07-31T13:42:00.000Z	moymoy	tanners	the partition specified in your menu.lst is correct.. try adding `makeactive` right above `chainloader +1`
2009-07-31T13:43:00.000Z	moymoy	tanners	yeah
2009-07-31T13:44:00.000Z	tanners	moymoy	ok ill try ill brb
2009-07-31T13:56:00.000Z	moymoy	tanners	how are things?
2009-07-31T13:57:00.000Z	moymoy	tanners	also.. when i was looking at your pastebin, i noticed you had two NTFS partitions.. which one is Vista installed on?
2009-07-31T13:59:00.000Z	moymoy	tanners	then i don't know.. everything in your menu.lst is right.. and grub should work with any other bootloader
2009-07-31T14:09:00.000Z	moymoy	tanners	back up your vista and win7 partitions using dd
2009-07-31T14:09:00.000Z	moymoy	tanners	do you have a huge external harddrive?
2009-07-31T14:10:00.000Z	moymoy	tanners	it copies a whole disk image of a partition .. a cloning tool sorta
2009-07-31T14:11:00.000Z	moymoy	tanners	=p .. i've never had these problems with ubuntu... then again, i never tried installing win7 .. seems to be a complicated process since a lot of people post about it on the ubuntuforums
2009-07-31T14:12:00.000Z	moymoy	tanners	what version are you installing anyway? .. that's weird.. the installer shouldn't be making these mistakes
2009-07-31T14:13:00.000Z	moymoy	tanners	well, i'm sorry ubuntu's been giving you this trouble.. you can try another distro... perhaps one with a more up-to-date GRUB
