2005-11-22T17:29:00.000Z	socketbind		hi, anybody managed to enable Coolbits in breezy?
2005-11-22T17:30:00.000Z	socketbind		I have no idea why Coolbits isn't working in breezy with the 7667 NVidia drivers
2005-11-22T17:30:00.000Z	socketbind		any idea, somebody? :(
2005-11-22T17:31:00.000Z	Kamping_Kaiser	socketbind	did you install the driver? or use the prepackaged?
2005-11-22T17:31:00.000Z	socketbind	Kamping_Kaiser	prepackaged version the restricted modules what I get with the kernel
2005-11-22T17:31:00.000Z	socketbind	Kamping_Kaiser	should I install it by hand? :-/
2005-11-22T17:31:00.000Z	socketbind		or manually perhaps
2005-11-22T17:33:00.000Z	socketbind	Kamping_Kaiser	did you managed to enable it? I would rather stick with the modules shipped with my current kernel
2005-11-22T17:33:00.000Z	socketbind		lol :D
2005-11-22T17:33:00.000Z	socketbind		seriously, I googled this thing to hell, anyone has an idea why coolbits isn't working? :D
2005-11-22T17:35:00.000Z	socketbind	Kamping_Kaiser	did you managed to enable it with the drivers available at nvidia's site?
2005-11-22T17:35:00.000Z	Kamping_Kaiser	socketbind	i havent tried. the ubuntu ones worked (ie i can play quake 3), so i havent pushed my luck
2005-11-22T17:36:00.000Z	socketbind	Kamping_Kaiser	well my card can run on a much higher core frequency and I would love to use the extra performance
2005-11-22T17:36:00.000Z	socketbind	Kamping_Kaiser	it's a simple FX5700 but I managed to get +100mhz core frequency from it
2005-11-22T17:37:00.000Z	Kamping_Kaiser	socketbind	yeh, my 5600 got damaged, but it's going, so I'm not screwing with it :)
2005-11-22T17:38:00.000Z	socketbind	Kamping_Kaiser	well I always overclocked all my cards, even the first one I got (Riva TNT), and I can't bear to overclock this one, on windoze it works nicely with this clock frequency
2005-11-22T17:38:00.000Z	Kamping_Kaiser	socketbind	yeh, know the feel, i just cant help  :(
2005-11-22T17:38:00.000Z	socketbind	Kamping_Kaiser	but I have no idea how to enable it on ubuntu, well whatever I should try it with the ones available nvidia's site
2005-11-22T17:39:00.000Z	socketbind	Kamping_Kaiser	well thanks for trying to help wish me luck :D
