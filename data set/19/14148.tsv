2008-07-24T06:31:00.000Z	Abed		i am running ssh server but i would like to use public/private keys in stead of regular password so anyone can help?
2008-07-24T06:31:00.000Z	jmarsden	Abed	what is the problem exactly with using SSH keys?
2008-07-24T06:33:00.000Z	jmarsden	Abed	OK.  That is not a problem.. Go ahead and use them...
2008-07-24T06:34:00.000Z	jmarsden	Abed	See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSHHowto#Public%20key%20authentication
2008-07-24T06:34:00.000Z	jmarsden	Abed	Ask if you have questions after that.
2008-07-24T06:37:00.000Z	jmarsden	Abed	Keep reading, see the section "Tip: Generating Public Keys" :-)
2008-07-24T06:45:00.000Z	jmarsden	Abed	It runs ssh-keygen with appropriate params to geenrate a public key....
2008-07-24T06:59:00.000Z	jmarsden	Abed	You need to create that authorized-keys file to include the keys you decide are authorized :-)
2008-07-24T07:00:00.000Z	jmarsden	Abed	Did you run the ssh-keygen command?
2008-07-24T07:01:00.000Z	jmarsden	Abed	Look in your ~/.ssh/ dir and see what files you have there?
2008-07-24T07:02:00.000Z	jmarsden	Abed	There should be both id_rsa (the secret key) and id_rsa.pub (the public one)
2008-07-24T07:03:00.000Z	jmarsden	Abed	Right, so you have both private and public key files there.... OK?
2008-07-24T07:03:00.000Z	jmarsden	Abed	Correct.
2008-07-24T07:04:00.000Z	jmarsden	Abed	Yes, in principle.  The PC you will be logging in from runs Ubuntu, right?
2008-07-24T07:05:00.000Z	jmarsden	Abed	For some other ssh apps you may have to "import" the key and convert it to a different file format
2008-07-24T07:06:00.000Z	jmarsden	Abed	The doc I linked to before has some info about using Putty from WIndows, for example.
2008-07-24T07:07:00.000Z	jmarsden	Abed	you can just copy the id_rsa and id_rsa.pub files to another Ubuntu PC into the ~/.ssh dir and use them from there
2008-07-24T07:08:00.000Z	jmarsden	Abed	Not 100% needed, but the public key is public anyway and keeping them together makes sense.
2008-07-24T07:09:00.000Z	jmarsden	Abed	No problem.
