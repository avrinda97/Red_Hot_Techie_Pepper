2007-05-12T08:15:00.000Z	kazol		How do I find the path of the DVD\CD drives in the syntax "/dev/*"?
2007-05-12T08:16:00.000Z	LjL	kazol	you don't. you need to guess. my CD could be, for instance, /dev/hdb, if i have PATA and the CD is the primary slave
2007-05-15T06:49:00.000Z	LjL	kazol	remove the "quiet" option from the kernel options
2007-05-15T06:55:00.000Z	kazol	LjL	How do I disable the kernel quiet option? Is it in the menu.Ist file?
2007-05-15T06:55:00.000Z	LjL	kazol	yep
2007-05-15T06:56:00.000Z	kazol	LjL	I have 3 instances of it.
2007-05-15T06:56:00.000Z	kazol	LjL	1st: "/boot/vmlinuz-2.6.20-15-generic root=UUID=bbfb28c1-8baf-4407-8aae-def237bf92f1 ro quiet splash"
2007-05-15T06:56:00.000Z	LjL	kazol	one is the normal kernel, another is the recovery mode, and the third honestly i don't know
2007-05-15T06:57:00.000Z	kazol	LjL	there is no quiet in recovery. Should I just remove "quiet" in normal?
2007-05-15T06:58:00.000Z	LjL	kazol	yes
2007-05-15T06:58:00.000Z	kazol	LjL	Thanks.
2007-05-15T06:58:00.000Z	kazol	LjL	also should I remove the "quiet" in "/boot/vmlinuz-2.6.20-15-generic root=UUID=bbfb28c1-8baf-4407-8aae-def237bf92f1 ro quiet splash"?
2007-05-15T06:59:00.000Z	LjL	kazol	remove it from everywhere it appears
2007-05-22T05:54:00.000Z	LjL	kazol	#users.openoffice.org if memory doesn't fail..
2007-05-25T06:15:00.000Z	LjL	kazol	because the first is b0rken
2007-12-22T06:36:00.000Z	LjL	kazol	none really
2007-12-22T06:41:00.000Z	kazol	LjL	:(
2007-12-22T06:41:00.000Z	kazol	LjL	I'm not sure why compiz crashes.
2007-12-22T06:41:00.000Z	LjL	kazol	you might try asking in #compiz-fusion as well
