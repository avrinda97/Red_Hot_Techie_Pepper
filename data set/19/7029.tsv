2008-03-18T08:13:00.000Z	berlylabs	xq	i cant figure this out to save my life, noone can find the answer
2008-03-18T08:13:00.000Z	berlylabs	xq	i edited the files by telnetting to the port they are running on
2008-03-18T08:13:00.000Z	berlylabs		then exited and did ripd SIGHUP
2008-03-18T08:13:00.000Z	berlylabs		this is the first time I've ever done that
2008-03-18T08:13:00.000Z	xq	berlylabs	It looks like it's a file permissions issue. What is trying to access/read/write to it? It may need permission to do so (read/write/execute)?
2008-03-18T08:13:00.000Z	berlylabs		zebra SIGHUP doesn't give that error
2008-03-18T08:13:00.000Z	berlylabs		it has permission
2008-03-18T08:14:00.000Z	berlylabs		ls -l /var/run/quagga/ripd.pid is... -rw----------
2008-03-18T08:14:00.000Z	xq	berlylabs	hmmm. Is Zebra already running?
2008-03-18T08:15:00.000Z	xq	berlylabs	OR are you -positive- zebra is being run with the correct permissions? OR /var/run/quagga exists / has the correct permissions? ;)
2008-03-18T08:15:00.000Z	berlylabs		just stopped it
2008-03-18T08:15:00.000Z	berlylabs		error still occurring
2008-03-18T08:16:00.000Z	xq	berlylabs	I recommend e-mailing http://www.quagga.net/lists.php the quagga list
2008-03-18T08:16:00.000Z	xq	berlylabs	They may be able to assist further. Let them know all steps you've done so far (all permission steps, everything.....) in detail. So they can assist from the get-go.
2008-03-18T08:16:00.000Z	xq	berlylabs	Because permissions and another instance of Zebra running is usually what is causing that error for most people.
2008-03-18T08:17:00.000Z	berlylabs		ok
2008-03-18T08:17:00.000Z	xq	berlylabs	Exact list - http://lists.quagga.net/mailman/listinfo/quagga-users
2008-03-18T08:17:00.000Z	berlylabs		maybe i should restart hte computer
2008-03-18T08:17:00.000Z	xq	berlylabs	They should respond pretty rapidly. I wish you luck. You may wish to restart, but it should not be needed at all. I recommend e-mailing the list. Make the e-mail as detailed as possible :)
