2009-10-10T20:31:00.000Z	bobo123		i installed rsh-server on my computer, but i can't find there the file known_hosts
2009-10-10T20:31:00.000Z	grawity	bobo123	Why the hell are you using rsh, tell me?
2009-10-10T20:32:00.000Z	bobo123	grawity	on university we are learning about it, so i'm trying it out
2009-10-10T20:32:00.000Z	grawity	bobo123	Really? rsh is quite insecure and never used anymore... you sure they aren't using _s_sh?
2009-10-10T20:33:00.000Z	bobo123	grawity	we will use ssh, later but i just wanna check rsh also
2009-10-10T20:33:00.000Z	bobo123	grawity	i've read some forum posts and they say ~/.rsh/known_hosts, file, but i can't find that file
2009-10-10T20:34:00.000Z	bobo123	grawity	so when i do rsh -l logName remoteComputer ls, it says Permission Denied, but without command i can log on
2009-10-10T20:34:00.000Z	grawity	bobo123	I think rshd is looking for the client host in ~/.rhosts
2009-10-10T20:35:00.000Z	grawity	bobo123	But, one more thing. Very often, the 'rsh' command actually runs a ssh client.
2009-10-10T20:36:00.000Z	bobo123	grawity	no .rhosts directory, there is nothing in /etc/ssh, just how to configure the ssh server, no hosts file
2009-10-10T20:36:00.000Z	grawity	bobo123	rsh and ssh are different things.
2009-10-10T20:36:00.000Z	bobo123	grawity	so how to set that my host is good for the rsh-server
2009-10-10T20:37:00.000Z	grawity	bobo123	create a _file_ ~/.rhosts
2009-10-10T20:37:00.000Z	bobo123	grawity	and what should i put there?
2009-10-10T20:38:00.000Z	grawity	bobo123	For a start, "+ +"
2009-10-10T20:38:00.000Z	grawity	bobo123	This will allow all users from all hostnames.
2009-10-10T20:38:00.000Z	bobo123	grawity	ok
2009-10-10T20:39:00.000Z	bobo123	grawity	thanks a lot, it works now
2009-10-10T20:40:00.000Z	grawity	bobo123	'man hosts.equiv' for more details.
