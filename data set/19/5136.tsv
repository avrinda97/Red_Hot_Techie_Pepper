2011-02-27T04:43:00.000Z	tuzlo		I somehow am not in the sudo users file anymore, what can I do to fix this other than re-installing Ubuntu.
2011-02-27T04:44:00.000Z	tuzlo		magpile I said I have been removed from the sudo list, that doesnt work
2011-02-27T04:46:00.000Z	tuzlo		why the hell does ubuntu have to complicate debian
2011-02-27T04:48:00.000Z	tuzlo		and how do you get into root? never set a root password or account for that matter of fact
2011-02-27T04:48:00.000Z	Ampelbein	tuzlo	you can't, root account has no valid password. why did you remove yourself from the sudoer file in the first place?
2011-02-27T04:49:00.000Z	tuzlo		im not tryin to hack anything
2011-02-27T04:49:00.000Z	tuzlo		and I never removed myself tfomr the sudoer file
2011-02-27T04:51:00.000Z	tuzlo		like I said the damn OS is saying im not a sudo user any more
2011-02-27T04:52:00.000Z	Ampelbein	tuzlo	does the 'groups' command say you are in the admin group?
2011-02-27T04:52:00.000Z	tuzlo	tuzlo	is not in the sudoers file.  This incident will be reported.
2011-02-27T04:52:00.000Z	tuzlo		in terminal
2011-02-27T04:52:00.000Z	tuzlo		not no more by the looks of iit
2011-02-27T04:53:00.000Z	tuzlo		yes
2011-02-27T04:55:00.000Z	tuzlo		was tryin to add users
2011-02-27T04:55:00.000Z	tuzlo		thats all
2011-02-27T04:56:00.000Z	Ampelbein	tuzlo	with the graphical tool or from the command line?
2011-02-27T04:56:00.000Z	tuzlo		would sdb be set if he had master slave to slave?
2011-02-27T04:56:00.000Z	tuzlo		it was thru an ssh connection, so command line
2011-02-27T04:57:00.000Z	Ampelbein	tuzlo	ok, then you must have used the wrong command, as none of the tools in ubuntu remove yourself from admin group automatically
