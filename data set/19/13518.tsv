2005-05-08T14:51:00.000Z	tsume	aroman	mono is not very stable yet
2005-05-08T14:51:00.000Z	aroman	tsume	are you sure? runs VERY stable here...
2005-05-08T14:51:00.000Z	tsume	aroman	I'm sure.
2005-05-08T14:51:00.000Z	tsume	aroman	and novell stole away the mono for bsd :(
2005-05-08T14:51:00.000Z	aroman	tsume	okay... which version did you run last?
2005-05-08T14:52:00.000Z	aroman		0.8? :P
2005-05-08T14:52:00.000Z	tsume	aroman	the current release, and it made a big fat segfault on me
2005-05-08T14:52:00.000Z	aroman	tsume	really? did you compile yourself?
2005-05-08T14:52:00.000Z	tsume	aroman	yes, with gcc 3.4
2005-05-08T14:52:00.000Z	tsume	aroman	I wasn't very happy
2005-05-08T14:52:00.000Z	aroman	tsume	I'm running mono and all the mono-related things compilef from svn with gcc-3.4... rock solid :/
