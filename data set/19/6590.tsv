2008-01-13T11:01:00.000Z	drgonzo00000		i got alsa mixer to detect my soundcard finally, but i still am getting no sound. Any suggestions?
2008-01-13T11:01:00.000Z	desertc	drgonzo00000	The sound is most likely muted
2008-01-13T11:01:00.000Z	drgonzo00000	desertc	its not muted in alsa
2008-01-13T11:02:00.000Z	desertc	drgonzo00000	There are lots of channels.  >> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/alsa-driver/+bug/156930 << Try this
2008-01-13T11:11:00.000Z	desertc	drgonzo00000	Did you read my link yet?
2008-01-13T11:13:00.000Z	desertc	drgonzo00000	You set all the channels to 100%?  And no sound?
2008-01-13T11:13:00.000Z	desertc	drgonzo00000	Are your speakers turned on?  Try a pair of headphones in the port, instead.
2008-01-13T11:15:00.000Z	desertc	drgonzo00000	You need to do more troubleshooting, because if it works in ALSA, then it is playing somewhere...
2008-01-13T11:15:00.000Z	drgonzo00000	desertc	it doesn't work in alsa. it just detects it
2008-01-13T11:30:00.000Z	desertc	drgonzo00000	What was it?
2008-01-13T11:30:00.000Z	desertc	drgonzo00000	What kind of lines?
2008-01-13T11:32:00.000Z	drgonzo00000	desertc	options snd-hda-intel model=toshiba was in quotes at the bottom of /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base
2008-01-13T11:32:00.000Z	desertc	drgonzo00000	Ooooohhh.... Jack was right
2008-01-13T11:33:00.000Z	drgonzo00000	desertc	i appreciate the help. thanks a lot. i understand its not very fun trying to troubleshoot others problems
2008-01-13T11:33:00.000Z	desertc	drgonzo00000	Thanks for the update.
2008-01-13T11:33:00.000Z	desertc	drgonzo00000	Glad to hear you're fixed up. Hey...
2008-01-13T11:33:00.000Z	desertc	drgonzo00000	Want some advice you'll thank me for later?
2008-01-13T11:34:00.000Z	desertc	drgonzo00000	Make a backup of that file.  Save it in your /home directory, print it out somewhere, save it in a million places, because you'll bump into this again with that computer.
2008-01-13T11:35:00.000Z	desertc	drgonzo00000	you're welcome, night
