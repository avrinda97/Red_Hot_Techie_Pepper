2007-08-07T09:05:00.000Z	serenityUK		welcome DigitalNinja ! we can see you
2007-08-07T09:05:00.000Z	DigitalNinja	serenityUK	Thanks
2007-08-07T09:06:00.000Z	serenityUK	DigitalNinja	kde is bigger, because it installs alot of apps with it
2007-08-07T09:07:00.000Z	DigitalNinja	serenityUK	I see. Any idea how big it is?
2007-08-07T09:07:00.000Z	DigitalNinja		I should install it my self and see
2007-08-07T09:08:00.000Z	serenityUK	DigitalNinja	i cant remember exactly because i have lost of extra download by now.. gnome on its own was less thatn 2 gig i think.. but you want free space for temp files etc
2007-08-07T09:09:00.000Z	DigitalNinja	serenityUK	Lets see... How about 10 gig's fro kde and gnome?
2007-08-07T09:09:00.000Z	serenityUK	DigitalNinja	yes fine..otherwise you will downloads will fill it up
2007-08-07T09:09:00.000Z	DigitalNinja	serenityUK	That includes /var and /tmp
2007-08-07T09:10:00.000Z	serenityUK		10 is plenety
2007-08-07T09:10:00.000Z	DigitalNinja	serenityUK	I'll put /home on another partition
2007-08-07T09:10:00.000Z	DigitalNinja		250 gig drive
2007-08-07T09:14:00.000Z	serenityUK	DigitalNinja	 ok even better.. if you home is separate you can even move it to another drive without breaking things. also reinstall and keep you settings
2007-08-07T09:14:00.000Z	DigitalNinja	serenityUK	That's the idea
2007-08-07T09:15:00.000Z	DigitalNinja	serenityUK	Thanks for the info. I'll install gnome and then add kde. That way I know for sure how much space it takes.
2007-08-07T09:16:00.000Z	serenityUK	DigitalNinja	yes you can pick one to use at the login screen
2007-08-07T09:16:00.000Z	DigitalNinja		Yup
2007-08-07T09:16:00.000Z	DigitalNinja		I don't use kde but I want to know how much space both will take up
2007-08-07T09:16:00.000Z	serenityUK	DigitalNinja	i saw a guy on the forums had 3 installs on ubuntu kubuntu and xubuntu didnt realise lol
