2007-05-29T16:53:00.000Z	silent_		jk ;P
2007-05-29T16:54:00.000Z	silent_		yes, 10 000 human beings spamming this channel with ignorance
2007-05-29T16:54:00.000Z	nickrud	silent_	that question was asked about 1000 users when there were only about 300 idling; the answer is the same: explain
2007-05-29T16:55:00.000Z	silent_	nickrud	I would be willing to bet money that either this channel had similar traffic due to the hype of the OS initially, and was filled with more experienced users, as most 'newbies' these days get linux because some one said its 'easy'
2007-05-29T16:56:00.000Z	nickrud	silent_	heh. The quality level of questions now is well above then; I could answer most then, hardly any now :)
2007-05-29T05:24:00.000Z	silent_	nickrud	If I had a system without important data on it, I'd be a little more careless and probably learn a lot :P
2007-12-15T13:44:00.000Z	nickrud	silent_	you will need to remove totem-mozilla as well
2007-12-15T13:45:00.000Z	silent_	nickrud	fantastic
2007-12-15T13:46:00.000Z	nickrud	silent_	what does about:plugins say in firefox?
2007-12-15T13:47:00.000Z	silent_	nickrud	I have both VLC plugin and Quicktime plugin enabled
2007-12-15T13:48:00.000Z	silent_	nickrud	any suggestions?
2007-12-15T13:48:00.000Z	silent_	nickrud	I have both VLC and quicktime plugin enabled
2007-12-15T13:49:00.000Z	nickrud	silent_	remove mozilla-plugin-vlc , totem-mozilla , install mozilla-mplayer, and go to https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Medibuntu#head-381bea41610683e5e26322fd7028e7aef85e3105-2 to get the codecs
2007-12-15T13:50:00.000Z	nickrud	silent_	Works for Meâ„¢
2008-02-04T08:11:00.000Z	nickrud	silent_	yeah, he mentioned cheap. Gateway seem to specialize in cheap these days
2008-02-04T08:11:00.000Z	silent_	nickrud	if I were to buy a new laptop, in hindsight with my hp purchase, I'd go for an ultra-portable lenovo
2008-02-04T08:11:00.000Z	nickrud	silent_	you mean, your $1500 :)
2008-02-04T08:12:00.000Z	silent_	nickrud	you want to buy it off me?
