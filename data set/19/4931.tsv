2008-10-07T06:39:00.000Z	dr_willis	voglster	 is that the app that moves a running X program from one X display to another?
2008-10-07T06:40:00.000Z	voglster	dr_willis	yup... im thinking about using this to accomplish my goal of running azureus or some other gui torrent app on a server and then moving it to the current Xserver im on
2008-10-07T06:41:00.000Z	dr_willis	voglster	 i rember it not working very well.. for your proboem.. what i do is use vncserver, with a minimal window manager. like jwm, then if i want to access the torrent app. I just run a vncclioent and connect to the 'torrent-vncdesktop'
2008-10-07T06:41:00.000Z	dr_willis	voglster	 my way lets the thing run inthe background and can be accessed from any box's with very little work.
2008-10-07T06:42:00.000Z	dr_willis	voglster	 many torrent apps have web interfaces/plugins these days also. :)

2008-10-07T06:44:00.000Z	dr_willis	voglster	 lets just say that last i used xmove... it was barely useable. :) it may be better now.
2008-10-07T06:45:00.000Z	voglster	dr_willis	ah well i didnt want to mess too much with vnc... meybe ill just use a text based torrent system with screen ;-)
