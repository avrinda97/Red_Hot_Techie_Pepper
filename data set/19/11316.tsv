2006-03-11T10:48:00.000Z	asterisk99		How can I tar -xvf xxxx.tar so that the files are placed into root and NOT the relative to the directory in which I am executing the tar???
2006-03-11T10:49:00.000Z	nickrud	asterisk99	sudo -i ; cd /root ; tar -xf there
2006-03-11T10:50:00.000Z	asterisk99	nickrud	Thanks... I was going blind looking for that option :)
2006-03-11T10:51:00.000Z	nickrud	asterisk99	reading back, avu had a simpler method; I use that one because I usually needed to get into root after the untar
2006-03-11T11:36:00.000Z	nickrud	asterisk99	your very first destructive testing, I take it 
2006-03-11T11:37:00.000Z	asterisk99	nickrud	hahahaha   yes .... very!!!!   better than one of the operators at Control Data who had a head crash on a removable disk pack, removed the pack, and tried it on 8 other disk units.... transferring metal oxide bits to every obne of the drives (thus, ruining them)
2006-03-11T11:38:00.000Z	nickrud	asterisk99	heh
2006-03-11T11:49:00.000Z	asterisk99	nickrud	This is pretty kewl.... My user id looked quite broken... I logged of to get ready for the Rescue boot, but tried to log back in again... linux repaired itself... happy camper time :)
2006-03-11T11:50:00.000Z	nickrud	asterisk99	something was out of sync, it seems. Perseverance Provides ;)
2006-03-11T11:50:00.000Z	asterisk99	nickrud	And... dumb luck
2006-03-11T11:51:00.000Z	nickrud	asterisk99	you ever use the shotgun approach to troubleshooting (hm, I think we're getting off topic here, too badk)
2006-03-11T11:58:00.000Z	asterisk99	nickrud	Guess what??? My regular user ... now has root privileges!!!!  Have I discoevered a HOLE in ubuntu security?
2006-03-11T12:01:00.000Z	nickrud	asterisk99	you shouldn't, you may have some oddities though. what's your user number?
2006-03-11T12:03:00.000Z	asterisk99	nickrud	1000
2006-03-11T12:04:00.000Z	nickrud	asterisk99	bummer. First one out. What groups do you belong to?
2006-03-11T12:06:00.000Z	asterisk99	nickrud	It was something residual --- a reboot fixed it ---- weird
2006-03-11T12:07:00.000Z	nickrud	asterisk99	judicious shotgunning, I see ;)
