2011-05-06T16:11:00.000Z	FrankJameso		Draco : does verything play slowly or just that one video?
2011-05-06T16:12:00.000Z	Draco_	FrankJameso	just that one ( it's the only highQ video I have, I think )
2011-05-06T16:13:00.000Z	FrankJameso	Draco_	check your graphics drivers, in 11.04 you can use the start button, and then just type in drivers to get to the additional drivers option
2011-05-06T16:14:00.000Z	Draco_	FrankJameso	I'm using the opensource drivers, video card is legacy and no longer supported ( Radeon 9600 Pro 256mb ddr )
2011-05-06T16:15:00.000Z	Draco_	FrankJameso	I've been strongly advised to do not install the propetary drivers ... and I don't know how to do that anyway
2011-05-06T16:17:00.000Z	Draco_	FrankJameso	I tought maybe there is some process that's eating up too much cpu, that might explain it
2011-05-06T16:18:00.000Z	FrankJameso	Draco_	I would really assume it's the driver, but try installing htop from the terminal, and then running it through the terminal while playing the video to see how much cpu it eats
2011-05-06T16:19:00.000Z	Draco_	FrankJameso	htop? anyway VLC uses 100%, of course
2011-05-06T16:20:00.000Z	FrankJameso	Draco_	it's really using 100% of cpu? what kind of cpu do you have?
2011-05-06T16:21:00.000Z	Draco_	FrankJameso	good old AMD XP 3000+ ( little more than 2ghz, single core )
2011-05-06T16:21:00.000Z	FrankJameso	Draco_	that seems a bit excessive, but the two options I see really are either trying with a different video card driver, or with a different codec. There's not much else I could suggest aside from compiling vlc from source, which is a bit complex
2011-05-06T16:23:00.000Z	Draco_	FrankJameso	the point is, I could never imagine the same video, with the same program, to go much slower  on ubuntu than on winxp ... I was expecting quite the opposite actually ...
2011-05-06T16:24:00.000Z	Draco_	FrankJameso	that's because I'm pretty sure the bottleneck here is the cpu, that's why I took this chance to make a little test, not sure if you get it
2011-05-06T16:24:00.000Z	Draco_	FrankJameso	but yeah, maybe it's the video driver ....
2011-05-06T16:25:00.000Z	Draco_	FrankJameso	could you explain me how to install this ati driver? I even downloaded it some day ago, but I don't know what to do with it
2011-05-06T16:26:00.000Z	FrankJameso	Draco_	I'm used to installing the nvidia driver, and I can go through the basic steps needed for that, I'm not too used to ati, so this guide may be more help https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI
2011-05-06T16:29:00.000Z	Draco_	FrankJameso	thanks but, that guide doesn't cover the legacy driver I need to install
2011-05-06T16:32:00.000Z	Draco_	FrankJameso	I guess I'll just try, if I screw up the ubuntu install even better ... maybe I should try some other distribution, ty for help
