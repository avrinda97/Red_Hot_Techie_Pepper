2007-03-30T13:29:00.000Z	ubunt00b		ubuntu won't start :(
2007-03-30T13:29:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	ubunt00b	you need to be more specific
2007-03-30T13:29:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	ubunt00b	you need to reinstall grub
2007-03-30T13:32:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	ubunt00b	i use live cd to rinstall grub on the correct partition
2007-03-30T13:33:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	ubunt00b	grub might be looking for your / on the bad HD, but i might be wrong
2007-03-30T13:34:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	ubunt00b	what I do is boot Live CD, go in terminal, sudo grub
2007-03-30T13:46:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	ubunt00b	call grub?
2007-03-30T13:46:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	ubunt00b	grub is a boot loader, so the specific wway to call it would be to boot your PC
2007-03-30T13:47:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	ubunt00b	that might be why its not booting, you sure all your HDs are correctly set up?
2007-03-30T14:27:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	ubunt00b	and it didn't work?
2007-03-30T14:28:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	ubunt00b	are you sure everything is setup right?
2007-03-30T14:29:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	ubunt00b	what partition is it on?
2007-03-30T14:29:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	ubunt00b	then try hd2,2
2007-03-30T15:30:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	ubunt00b	the problem is your grub doesn't find your / partition
2007-03-30T15:26:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	ubunt00b	/boot/grub/menu.lst
2007-03-30T15:27:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	ubunt00b	ive never used grub-config
2007-03-30T15:31:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	ubunt00b	the menu.lst was broken?
2007-03-30T15:31:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	ubunt00b	if it was broken, give it a try
