2011-01-26T05:22:00.000Z	jsec	ratpit	yes. how did you go about it? from the additional drivers prompt? apt-get? ati's website?
2011-01-26T05:22:00.000Z	ratpit	jsec	apt-get.
2011-01-26T05:23:00.000Z	jsec	ratpit	ok. and how is it not working?
2011-01-26T05:25:00.000Z	ratpit	jsec	when i try to open the ati catalys control center it says no adapter cards i nuse on this system, and when i look in under system>admin>hardware drivers, nothing shows p
2011-01-26T05:25:00.000Z	ratpit		up*
2011-01-26T05:26:00.000Z	jsec	ratpit	what kind of card do you have?
2011-01-26T05:26:00.000Z	jsec	ratpit	and did you run the config after installation?
2011-01-26T05:27:00.000Z	ratpit		thanks had it since childhood
2011-01-26T05:27:00.000Z	ratpit	jsec	 lspci says radeon 9200
2011-01-26T05:28:00.000Z	jsec	ratpit	fglrx discontinued support for that card. :(
2011-01-26T05:29:00.000Z	ratpit	jsec	any ideas on what I can do now?
2011-01-26T05:30:00.000Z	jsec	ratpit	buy an nvidia. much better support than ati. (coming from someone that just fought for two days to get compiz+fglrx working on his mobility radeon 3200)
2011-01-26T05:30:00.000Z	jsec		;)
2011-01-26T05:30:00.000Z	jsec	ratpit	otherwise you're stuck with the regular "ati" driver that comes with X.
2011-01-26T05:30:00.000Z	ratpit	jsec	how do i get that back?
2011-01-26T05:33:00.000Z	jsec	ratpit	i'd imagine opening synaptic and removing any fglrx packages would be sufficient, but i don't want to mislead you and bork your system as i've never had to do it before.
