2005-04-20T06:44:00.000Z	kerframil	mdke	have you tried removing your "~/.gnome2/session" file from a console prior to logging in?
2005-04-20T06:44:00.000Z	mdke	kerframil	will do
2005-04-20T06:44:00.000Z	kerframil	mdke	worth a shot anyway
2005-04-20T06:52:00.000Z	mdke	kerframil	that did the trick, nice one

2005-04-20T06:53:00.000Z	kerframil	mdke	probably tried to persist something dodgy to your session at one logout
2005-04-20T06:53:00.000Z	mdke	kerframil	it only happened after upgrading to the last splash screen
2005-04-20T06:53:00.000Z	kerframil	mdke	I see
