2009-08-16T21:45:00.000Z	neodragon		can anyone help me with samba problems in ubuntu 9.04?
2009-08-16T21:45:00.000Z	jrib	neodragon	best to just ask the channel your actual question (on a single line)
2009-08-16T21:46:00.000Z	jrib	neodragon	repeat every ~10 minutes so new people know what your issue is.  Also try other support options
2009-08-16T21:50:00.000Z	jrib	neodragon	you should probably say how you are trying to access them and what the result was
2009-08-16T21:52:00.000Z	neodragon	jrib	I can access them through firefox, but when I go to >Places>Networks and click on Windows Network, it says "unable to mount location, failed to retreive share list from server."
2009-08-16T21:54:00.000Z	jrib	neodragon	try entering "smb://ip_or_computer_name/share_name" in nautilus's location bar
2009-08-16T21:57:00.000Z	neodragon	jrib	when I do that it says "Could not dislplay 'smb://ip-address/share-name'. Nautilus cannot handle this kind of locations."
2009-08-16T21:58:00.000Z	neodragon	jrib	does this mean I am missing some plugin for nautilus?
2009-08-16T21:58:00.000Z	neodragon	jrib	yes
2009-08-16T21:59:00.000Z	jrib	neodragon	what version of ubuntu is this?
2009-08-16T21:59:00.000Z	neodragon	jrib	ubuntu 9.04 on both the server and the laptop
2009-08-16T22:00:00.000Z	jrib	neodragon	what if you just do: smb://local-ip-address-of-comupter
2009-08-16T22:01:00.000Z	neodragon	jrib	the same exact error message comes up
2009-08-16T22:02:00.000Z	jrib	neodragon	hrmm, can you use smbclient?
2009-11-08T02:56:00.000Z	jrib	neodragon	chees is in the repositories
2009-11-08T02:56:00.000Z	jrib	neodragon	cheese too
2009-11-08T02:57:00.000Z	jrib	neodragon	how are you looking?
2009-11-08T03:00:00.000Z	neodragon	jrib	nevermind I found it, I just needed to update synaptic
