2007-07-06T07:04:00.000Z	zenobia	rejden	Are your universe sources uncommented?
2007-07-06T07:05:00.000Z	rejden	zenobia	i'm using source.list from ubuntuguide.org (copy/paste)
2007-07-06T07:05:00.000Z	zenobia	rejden	Give me a sec to check in which repo the headers are

2007-07-06T07:08:00.000Z	zenobia	rejden	I only have 6.20 in my repo's, since I use feisty. Sorry.
2007-07-06T07:09:00.000Z	rejden	zenobia	6.20?
2007-07-06T07:10:00.000Z	zenobia	rejden	linux-headers-2.6.20-16 and such
2007-07-06T07:10:00.000Z	rejden	zenobia	have the same, but they ain't kernel headers
2007-07-06T07:10:00.000Z	zenobia	rejden	linux-headers-2.6.20-16-386 - Linux kernel headers for version 2.6.20 on i386
2007-07-06T07:11:00.000Z	rejden	zenobia	but they are not complete
2007-07-06T07:11:00.000Z	rejden	zenobia	I cannot build third party modul drivers
2007-07-06T07:12:00.000Z	zenobia	rejden	Strange, this is what I had to use to compile them.
2007-07-06T07:12:00.000Z	zenobia	rejden	Afraid I can't help oyu then
