2005-07-13T12:22:00.000Z	sono		Hello  friends.
2005-07-13T12:23:00.000Z	sono		I am trying to clean and recreate a bug that makes VIA sound chipsets to produce slight audio crackles.
2005-07-13T12:23:00.000Z	sono		I have been testing and recompiling my audio apps looking for the source of the problem.
2005-07-13T12:24:00.000Z	_crimsun	sono	snd_via82xx?
2005-07-13T12:25:00.000Z	_crimsun	sono	default alsa on hoary? (1.0.6)
2005-07-13T12:25:00.000Z	_crimsun	sono	using alsa directly or esound/polypaudio?
2005-07-13T12:26:00.000Z	_crimsun	sono	alsa's oss emulation or oss/free?
2005-07-13T12:27:00.000Z	_crimsun	sono	does plughw:0,0 work (presuming snd_via82xx is driver 0)
2005-07-13T12:29:00.000Z	sono	_crimsun	I am about to test the output of xmms using the plughw:0,0 output
2005-07-13T12:30:00.000Z	_crimsun	sono	for the alsa output plugin
2005-07-13T12:30:00.000Z	sono	_crimsun	yep
2005-07-13T12:33:00.000Z	sono	_crimsun	ok... this is pretty interesting, little cracking was reduced, but didn't dissapeared; is there a buffering or sound chunk priority parameter set for the ALSA Playback code?
2005-07-13T12:33:00.000Z	_crimsun	sono	yes, there's a /proc entry
2005-07-13T12:34:00.000Z	_crimsun	sono	keep in mind you can also adjust the buffer parameters from within alsa
2005-07-13T12:34:00.000Z	_crimsun	sono	rather, xmms
2005-07-13T12:34:00.000Z	sono	_crimsun	ok... anyway I only use xmms for testing
2005-07-13T12:59:00.000Z	sono	_crimsun	hmmm well, I still raised buffers to the top, getting no better output.  Volumes indeed are under 30%, but the cracking is still present...
2005-07-13T13:00:00.000Z	sono	_crimsun	now I will test on the file format end... going to Audacity.
2005-07-13T13:01:00.000Z	_crimsun	sono	via onboard, unfortunately, is highly suspect
