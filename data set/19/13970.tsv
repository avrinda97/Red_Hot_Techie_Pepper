2006-03-16T08:41:00.000Z	kditty		i have a newb question here, really newbie ;]  i downloaded thunderbird, and decompressed it to my temp folder and i cant figure out how to install it
2006-03-16T08:43:00.000Z	Managu	kditty	happen to recall the filename extension of what you downloaded?
2006-03-16T08:45:00.000Z	Managu	kditty	couple of thoughts.  First, Ubuntu probably has Thunderbird packaged, and unless you've got a reason to use the newest version, you'd probably be better off with the package
2006-03-16T08:46:00.000Z	Managu	kditty	if you do want to install from the tarball, you've almost certainly got the right filename.  Might want to run it with sudo, e.g. "sudo /path/mo\zilla-installer-bin"
2006-03-16T08:51:00.000Z	Managu	kditty	it gets easier with practice.
2006-03-16T09:21:00.000Z	Managu	kditty	(a) did you install with english as the default language/etc?
2006-03-16T09:22:00.000Z	Managu	kditty	(b) have you tried synaptic? (System->administration->Synaptic package manager)
2006-03-16T09:25:00.000Z	Managu	kditty	ouch.  Where did you find them?
2006-03-16T09:25:00.000Z	Managu	kditty	yes, but under which category?
2006-03-16T09:27:00.000Z	Managu	kditty	ok.  lemme see.  What's in your sources.list file?
2006-03-16T09:30:00.000Z	Managu	kditty	in synaptic, go back to the categories view, and find the "email" category
2006-03-16T09:36:00.000Z	Managu	kditty	errm, could you paste your sources.list file into http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/?
2006-03-16T09:39:00.000Z	Managu	kditty	got that sources.list file open in an editor?  Take the '#' off the beginning of lines 3 and 4.  Get rid of the first space too, so that they start with "deb"
2006-03-16T09:40:00.000Z	Managu	kditty	save.  Close synaptic and restart it
2006-03-16T09:41:00.000Z	Managu	kditty	when you get synaptic restarted, click "reload"
2006-03-16T09:42:00.000Z	Managu	kditty	depends on the error.  PRobably not, but let's cross our fingers
2006-03-16T09:43:00.000Z	Managu	kditty	good.  Sources.list is an important file in debian and in ubuntu.  You'll want to probably "uncomment" a few more of those lines as time goes on.  There's more information on the support pages at ubuntulinux.com
2006-03-16T09:44:00.000Z	Managu	kditty	now if only someone knew the answer to my question =D
2006-03-16T09:48:00.000Z	Managu	kditty	yeah, you can use synaptic to remove packages as well
