2012-01-18T14:01:00.000Z	spim		Hello.
2012-01-18T14:01:00.000Z	spim		Is this the place to ask about VCD?
2012-01-18T14:01:00.000Z	spim		.
2012-01-18T14:01:00.000Z	spim		VLC*
2012-01-18T14:02:00.000Z	spim		I am. ;)
2012-01-18T14:02:00.000Z	spim		So there's no dedicated VLC serv?
2012-01-18T14:04:00.000Z	spim		Ugh, sorry. Not VLC.
2012-01-18T14:04:00.000Z	spim		VNC.
2012-01-18T14:04:00.000Z	Corey	spim	What's the real world problem you're trying to solve? :-)
2012-01-18T14:06:00.000Z	Corey	spim	Again, what's the real world problem you're trying to solve?
2012-01-18T14:06:00.000Z	spim	Corey	I apoligize. Just want to make sure I'm in the right place.
2012-01-18T14:07:00.000Z	Corey	spim	Fire away, if you're not we'll point you in the right direction.
2012-01-18T14:11:00.000Z	Corey	spim	Firstly, I'm doing something similar.  The iPad3 will help this.
2012-01-18T14:11:00.000Z	spim	Corey	iPad 3? Has it even been announced?
2012-01-18T14:11:00.000Z	Corey	spim	Secondly, I do everything via GNU screen and the console, so I can't lend much wisdom on the GUI side.
2012-01-18T14:11:00.000Z	Corey	spim	No, but it's going to have better resolution.
2012-01-18T14:11:00.000Z	Corey	spim	Release in probably two months or less.
2012-01-18T14:12:00.000Z	spim	Corey	Cool.
