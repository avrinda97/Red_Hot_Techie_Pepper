2006-10-08T13:40:00.000Z	jaux		hi, could anyone help me about my "GWGET"?
2006-10-08T13:42:00.000Z	jaux		I can't make GWGET work, it always gives me error msg "ERROR: unknown error", could anyone help me about that?
2006-10-08T13:43:00.000Z	jrib	jaux	what command are you issuing?
2006-10-08T13:44:00.000Z	jaux	jrib	gwget
2006-10-08T13:46:00.000Z	jrib	jaux	strange, did it ever work?
2006-10-08T13:47:00.000Z	jaux	jrib	I tried several times, but it only works when I am trying to download a image from flickr
2006-10-08T13:47:00.000Z	jaux	jrib	otherwise, it doesn't work at all
2006-10-08T13:48:00.000Z	jrib	jaux	if you run 'gwget' from a terminal does it open?
2006-10-08T13:48:00.000Z	jaux	jrib	yes
2006-10-08T13:48:00.000Z	jrib	jaux	oh oh, so the problem is with downloading specific files
2006-10-08T13:48:00.000Z	jaux	jrib	but it can't download anything except an image from flickr
2006-10-08T13:49:00.000Z	jrib	jaux	does it give you any errors in the terminal when it fails?
2006-10-08T13:54:00.000Z	jaux	jrib	when I run gwget from termial, I got"** (Gwget:4218): CRITICAL **: view_selection_func: assertion `gwget_data_get_selected()!=NULL' failed
2006-10-08T13:55:00.000Z	jaux	jrib	and in the gwget window, it says "ERROR: Unknown error"
2006-10-08T13:56:00.000Z	jrib	jaux	that error pops up in the terminal everytime you get the "unknown error"?  Or does it only show up once when you start gwget?
2006-10-08T13:56:00.000Z	jaux	jrib	only show up once when I type in the command
2006-10-08T13:57:00.000Z	jaux	jrib	I was trying to download "http://superb-west.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/drjava/drjava-stable-20060918-1737.jar"
2006-10-08T13:59:00.000Z	jrib	jaux	hmm not really sure what is happening jaux, sorry
2006-10-08T14:00:00.000Z	jaux	jrib	all right, thank you anyway, I am going to try whether my wget is working or not
