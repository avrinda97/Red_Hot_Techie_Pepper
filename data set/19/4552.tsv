2008-12-21T08:36:00.000Z	enovativ_		but i thought i read some where that a "RAW" drive could be converted to FAT32 or NTFS using linux
2008-12-21T08:36:00.000Z	enovativ_		i have tried other utilities thru windows and had no luck
2008-12-21T08:37:00.000Z	dmole	enovativ_	I thought I told you the problem is not converting ?was I wrong?
2008-12-21T08:37:00.000Z	dmole	enovativ_	you need to recover your partition
2008-12-21T08:38:00.000Z	enovativ_	dmole	how do i go about doing that ?   can i used gparted to do that ?
2008-12-21T08:38:00.000Z	dmole	enovativ_	no
2008-12-21T08:38:00.000Z	enovativ_	dmole	is there a utility in  linux that can "recover" the partition ?
2008-12-21T08:39:00.000Z	dmole	enovativ_	you need some HD recovery tools but it would help if you knew what it was before it got corupted
2008-12-21T08:39:00.000Z	dmole	enovativ_	do you know?
2008-12-21T08:39:00.000Z	enovativ_	dmole	i am going to assume NTFS....because windws xp only sees but so much GB of space on a FAT32 partition ...am i correct ?
2008-12-21T08:41:00.000Z	dmole	enovativ_	NTFS is probable
2008-12-21T08:41:00.000Z	enovativ_	dmole	so now i have to find HD recovery tools...i used several in windows, and they did not work
2008-12-21T08:41:00.000Z	enovativ_		so i will research to see if linux offers any
2008-12-21T08:43:00.000Z	dmole	enovativ_	yah there are good ones for linux but they are harder to use you can edit it manualy but you want to avoid that.
2008-12-21T08:43:00.000Z	dmole	enovativ_	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DataRecovery#Lost%20Partition
2008-12-21T08:43:00.000Z	enovativ_	dmole	i do not want to pay any utility to do what i need done...so i might have to learn how to do it manually
2008-12-21T08:44:00.000Z	enovativ_	dmole	thanks for the link
2008-12-21T08:46:00.000Z	dmole	enovativ_	you should also look up some tools to see if the HD is faulty. + repair the file system
2008-12-21T08:50:00.000Z	dmole	enovativ_	keep in mind that your partition could be ok but the FS on it could be corrupted
