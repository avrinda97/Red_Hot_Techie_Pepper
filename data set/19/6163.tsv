2012-04-05T21:10:00.000Z	netbus	danny	if you're using chrome, that's a different story.
2012-04-05T21:11:00.000Z	netbus	danny	on the windows and osx chrome programs, flash is automatically maintained and updated by the browser
2012-04-05T21:11:00.000Z	netbus	danny	it automatically updates the flash for you so..i'm not sure why your video isn't working.
2012-04-05T21:11:00.000Z	danny	netbus	that means i just have to wait for an update :(
2012-04-05T21:11:00.000Z	danny	netbus	works fine on windows
2012-04-05T21:11:00.000Z	netbus	danny	not necessarily, it could mean there's a setting or something that's not on

2012-04-05T21:12:00.000Z	netbus	danny	you could try installing flash for another browser, like firefox,
