2010-08-14T07:45:00.000Z	smw	Jordan_U	true
2010-08-24T00:20:00.000Z	smw	Jordan_U	I installed it after the fact. It is very easy to do

2010-12-15T06:06:00.000Z	smw	Jordan_U	It is not that offtopic
2010-12-15T06:06:00.000Z	Jordan_U	smw	It is not related to Ubuntu support.

2010-12-15T06:35:00.000Z	smw	Jordan_U	so you agree with me?
2010-12-15T06:35:00.000Z	Jordan_U	smw	If you think that in most cases it's better *not* to use a separate /home, yes.
2010-12-15T06:36:00.000Z	smw	Jordan_U	than I don't agree with you. Did you read the link you gave me?
2010-12-15T06:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U	smw	Ahh, I got that link from googling and expected it to be the post quoted rather than that post.
2010-12-15T06:37:00.000Z	smw	Jordan_U	I agree with the post, not the quote ;-)
2010-12-15T06:37:00.000Z	smw	Jordan_U	having a separate /home helps me keep my data when I upgrade (by reinstalling)
2010-12-15T06:38:00.000Z	smw	Jordan_U	I was also able to keep data after switching from archlinux back to ubuntu
2010-12-15T06:38:00.000Z	Jordan_U	smw	If you read the quoted post, http://castrojo.tumblr.com/post/1093664654/no-need-to-complicate-your-life , you'll see that you don't need a separate /home to keep your /home during a re-install.
2010-12-15T06:38:00.000Z	smw	Jordan_U	I would argue with anyone who wanted a separate /usr or /var ;-).
2010-12-15T06:39:00.000Z	smw	Jordan_U	I am reading it now
2010-12-15T06:43:00.000Z	smw	Jordan_U	great post... it still won't change my mind. (and yes, I "upgrade" with full installs. But I don't recommend that to others ;-)
2010-12-15T06:44:00.000Z	Jordan_U	smw	Fair enough :)
