2009-12-14T09:48:00.000Z	workstation		wow, can someone help me with deleting a file!? I am root, and cant chown or chmod the file whatsoever, do Not have permission to do anything? What is going on?
2009-12-14T09:48:00.000Z	losha	workstation	what does ls -l <file> say (that's lower case L)
2009-12-14T09:49:00.000Z	workstation	losha	-r--r--r-- 1 root root 12800 2009-12-13 14:07 extlinux.sys
2009-12-14T09:49:00.000Z	losha	workstation	and also, ls -ld .
2009-12-14T09:50:00.000Z	losha	workstation	and also, ls -ld .  <---- note trailing dot
2009-12-14T09:50:00.000Z	workstation	losha	exact same thing
2009-12-14T09:50:00.000Z	losha	workstation	the containing directory has to be wx by root I think
2009-12-14T09:50:00.000Z	workstation	losha	drwxr-xr-x 3 root root  4096 2009-12-13 20:40 .     -r--r--r-- 1 root root 12800 2009-12-13 14:07 extlinux.sys
2009-12-14T09:51:00.000Z	losha	workstation	did that do it?
2009-12-14T09:52:00.000Z	workstation	losha	well I  chmod -wx to the directory it is contained in, but did not help to delete the file within
2009-12-14T09:52:00.000Z	workstation	losha	I believe it was   wx before, now all the permission are completely different
2009-12-14T09:53:00.000Z	losha	workstation	that's weird. Is there something you haven't told me about this filesystem?
2009-12-14T09:55:00.000Z	workstation	losha	well.... its a mounted partition on a USB Drive that is formated to fat32. I used Unetbootin to install a MintLinux distro to it. But now I want to delete all the contents of the partition, which I have, except this file.
2009-12-14T09:59:00.000Z	workstation	losha	any other suggestions?
2009-12-14T10:00:00.000Z	losha	workstation	since you're wiping the partition anyway, why not just reformat it....?
2009-12-14T10:00:00.000Z	workstation	losha	yea I gess I can do that
2009-12-14T10:08:00.000Z	losha	workstation	did that work?
2009-12-14T10:08:00.000Z	workstation	losha	yes, Thank you for the help
2009-12-15T10:12:00.000Z	losha	workstation	you have to make sure the uuids and the file pathnames are correct
