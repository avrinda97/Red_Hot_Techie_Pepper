2008-05-23T02:01:00.000Z	TimMatrix		Help, anyone experienced a missing capital 'c'?    I tried pressing SHIFT-c and nothing comes out.  All other characters works, both UPPER and lower.  Why isn't the character 'c' working?
2008-05-23T02:02:00.000Z	Lt88	TimMatrix	is capslock [on]?
2008-05-23T02:03:00.000Z	TimMatrix	Lt88	the letter 'c' works if on capslock, see this...  C  .. but that's besides the point, why can't shift-c make it capitalized?
2008-05-23T02:03:00.000Z	Lt88	TimMatrix	if capslock is on, shift+c will be in lower case
2008-05-23T02:04:00.000Z	TimMatrix	Lt88	capslock is OFF,  I know what I am doing.
2008-05-23T02:05:00.000Z	TimMatrix	Lt88	just that it's weird that capital-c doesn't work , when the rest of the keyboard works with SHIFT keys.
2008-05-23T02:06:00.000Z	TimMatrix	Lt88	just a note to let you know:  if i keep the capslock ON, pressing SHIFT-c would not come out, but on its own, it came out as capital c.
2008-05-23T02:08:00.000Z	TimMatrix	Lt88	when I typed dmesg | grep -i input, the relevant came up which reads:  AT Translated Set 2 keyboard as /devices/platform/i8042/serio0/input/input1.   Mean anything
2008-05-23T02:10:00.000Z	TimMatrix	Lt88	any ideas?
2008-05-23T02:11:00.000Z	Lt88	TimMatrix	click system - preferences - keyboard - layout.
2008-05-23T02:11:00.000Z	Lt88	TimMatrix	check the plug, be sure it's not loose.
2008-05-23T02:12:00.000Z	TimMatrix	Lt88	the keyboard model says: Generic 105-Key (intl) Pc
2008-05-23T02:12:00.000Z	Lt88	TimMatrix	try generic 104
2008-05-23T02:12:00.000Z	TimMatrix	Lt88	I can type the characters, so the connection is OK.
2008-05-23T02:13:00.000Z	TimMatrix	Lt88	nope didn't work
2008-05-23T02:13:00.000Z	TimMatrix	Lt88	 maybe I try a different keyboard????
2008-05-23T02:14:00.000Z	Lt88	TimMatrix	if you have spare, yes try it.
2008-05-23T02:14:00.000Z	Lt88	TimMatrix	restart X possibly too.
2008-05-23T02:14:00.000Z	TimMatrix	Lt88	sure, brb, signing off.
