2010-08-13T15:59:00.000Z	Somelauw		I can't figure out how to open a certain postscript file. I tried using open-office, but it doesn't work. I can upload the postscript file, if you want me to.
2010-08-13T16:00:00.000Z	shirtless	Somelauw	what is contained in the postscript file
2010-08-13T16:01:00.000Z	shirtless	Somelauw	Yeah, but what kind of data is it. Is it a book about your dog? What is it
2010-08-13T16:02:00.000Z	Somelauw	shirtless	it was an example for metauml: http://metauml.sourceforge.net/old/faq.html
2010-08-13T16:03:00.000Z	Somelauw	shirtless	I followed the compilation step using mpost and it created a file called example.1 but I can't open it.
2010-08-13T16:04:00.000Z	shirtless	Somelauw	you should be able to open it with gv/ghostscript.
2010-08-13T16:05:00.000Z	shirtless	Somelauw	i googled and it seems like OO is not very good at postscript.
2010-08-13T16:12:00.000Z	Somelauw	shirtless	I tried ghostscript, but it gave me an error.
2010-08-13T16:12:00.000Z	shirtless	Somelauw	what was the error?
2010-08-13T16:16:00.000Z	shirtless	Somelauw	Can you PM me a link to the file?
2010-08-13T16:27:00.000Z	Somelauw	shirtless	here it comes
2010-08-13T16:27:00.000Z	shirtless	Somelauw	you mean by DCC?
2010-08-13T16:27:00.000Z	shirtless	Somelauw	It won't work, because I'm behind a firewall.
2010-08-13T16:28:00.000Z	Somelauw	shirtless	wait I'll upload
2010-08-13T16:30:00.000Z	Somelauw	shirtless	my upload-site doesn't work, but since it is readable as text, I pastebin'd it: http://www.pastebin.org/478700
2010-08-13T16:30:00.000Z	shirtless	Somelauw	that's best anyway
2010-08-13T16:46:00.000Z	shirtless	Somelauw	I think I found a solution for this
2010-08-13T16:46:00.000Z	shirtless	Somelauw	install texlive-fonts-recommended
2010-08-13T17:00:00.000Z	Somelauw	shirtless	I tried install texlive-fonts-recommended, but it told me I already have the latest version.
