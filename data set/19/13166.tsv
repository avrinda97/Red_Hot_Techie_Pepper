2005-05-10T15:20:00.000Z	outlier		Can you tap into debian repositories?  I'd like to grab some packages I'm not seeing in ubuntu (kids' stuff: junior-* in particular)
2005-05-10T15:20:00.000Z	Nafallo	outlier	they are in universe
2005-05-10T15:22:00.000Z	Nafallo	outlier	ahh, you'll need to add universe for them. you will probably never have to touch debian :-).
2005-05-10T15:23:00.000Z	outlier	Nafallo	Good, I like debian, but life's complicated enough as is.  If I can get my hands on a supported wireless card, I should be in business then.
2005-05-10T15:24:00.000Z	Nafallo	outlier	I got unsupported ralink rt2500. just had to borrow my girlfriend tp while installing and then compiled the wireless drivers from cvs :-).
2005-05-10T15:27:00.000Z	outlier	Nafallo	sounds like the same one I have - linksys wmp54g v4.
2005-05-10T15:29:00.000Z	outlier	Nafallo	Rather than mess with it, I'm going to return the card (which I'm allowed to do for a few days yet) and tell them it wasn't compatible with my OS.  They have several others in stock, so I should be able to swap it for a supported one.
2005-05-10T15:30:00.000Z	Nafallo	outlier	oki. I stick to mine. the drivers are GPL'd and a rewrite of the driver is in beta-stage :-).
2005-05-10T15:30:00.000Z	Nafallo	outlier	should support a/b/g :-)
2005-05-10T15:38:00.000Z	outlier	Nafallo	I have to admit I like the idea of GPL drivers, and if I had some other networking on that box I'd take the time, but as is I'll be satisfied to give another 'returned because no linux drivers' data point to the vendor.
2005-05-10T15:39:00.000Z	Nafallo	outlier	well. the vendor broke against GPL. I notified the holder of the broken copyright, and the driver is GPL'd. I would say they don't need more pointers for a while ;-).
2005-05-10T15:41:00.000Z	outlier	Nafallo	I see.  Thanks for the info.
2005-05-10T15:43:00.000Z	Nafallo	outlier	no problem. if you know how to compile the driver I would keep the card and compile the driver from sf.net/projects/rt2400, but that's your call :-).
2005-05-10T15:45:00.000Z	outlier	Nafallo	I guess I'll give it a go before I swap out the card. From what I'd read, I would need to use a windows driver with some sort of wrapper that didn't work with every kernel, etc.  I gather its better than that now.
2005-05-10T15:46:00.000Z	Nafallo	outlier	if it is an rt2500-chipset it sure is :-)
2005-05-10T15:46:00.000Z	outlier	Nafallo	That's what lspci claims, so I guess it is.
2005-05-10T15:46:00.000Z	Nafallo	outlier	kewl :-)
2005-05-10T15:47:00.000Z	outlier	Nafallo	catch you later, and thanks.
2005-05-10T15:47:00.000Z	Nafallo	outlier	oki. see ya :-).
