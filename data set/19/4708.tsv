2009-03-02T14:51:00.000Z	n838901	hmw	did you right-click on Network Manager and edit the connection before you tried to connect?
2009-03-02T14:52:00.000Z	hmw	n838901	wicd deinstalled NetworkManager. It would not function anyways, I tried quite hard.
2009-03-02T15:30:00.000Z	n838901	hmw	gnome-ppp is a good gui
2009-03-02T15:31:00.000Z	hmw	n838901	thats not the thing, which is already installed. Any other similar programs?

2009-03-02T15:31:00.000Z	hmw	n838901	it should work already, i just forgot how to start the connection.
2009-03-02T15:31:00.000Z	n838901	hmw	gnome-ppp will start the connection
2009-03-02T15:33:00.000Z	n838901	hmw	configure gnome-ppp to use /dev/***  (*** being the modem in question)
2009-03-02T15:33:00.000Z	hmw	n838901	you misunderstand me. I need to figure out, how to use the existing solution. I need it quickly for the other noteboook.
