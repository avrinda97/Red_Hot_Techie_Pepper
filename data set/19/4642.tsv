2008-12-04T05:53:00.000Z	bdelin88	amikrop	get more users to linux is what you have to do
2008-12-04T05:56:00.000Z	bdelin88	amikrop	how do you think MAC feels?
2008-12-04T05:56:00.000Z	amikrop	bdelin88	don't know
2008-12-04T06:04:00.000Z	bdelin88	amikrop	yes but then we are still dealing with the same directx problem i think, microsoft still holds the bread and butter for gaming platforms
2008-12-04T06:05:00.000Z	amikrop	bdelin88	If Linux gets into the market share, then, games will be ported to OpenGL...
2008-12-04T06:05:00.000Z	bdelin88	amikrop	but opengl is not near as wonderful :)
2008-12-04T06:05:00.000Z	amikrop	bdelin88	what do you mean?
2008-12-04T06:06:00.000Z	bdelin88	amikrop	i just always see better frames with directx games
2008-12-04T06:06:00.000Z	amikrop	bdelin88	Well, OpenGL can be improved...
2008-12-04T06:07:00.000Z	bdelin88	amikrop	it's been around and "improving" forever lol
2008-12-04T06:07:00.000Z	amikrop	bdelin88	Especially, if nVidia and stuff take the Linux thing more seriously
2008-12-04T06:08:00.000Z	bdelin88	amikrop	linux, even though it is very nice right now, just still isn't "there" for the typical user
2008-12-04T06:08:00.000Z	amikrop	bdelin88	why not?
2008-12-04T06:08:00.000Z	bdelin88	amikrop	well yes you can take a bunch of steps to make it looks nice and things like that, but it looks very ugly out of the box imo, they need things like screenlets and awn packaged right into it
2008-12-04T06:09:00.000Z	amikrop	bdelin88	That's mostly a marketing issue.
2008-12-04T06:09:00.000Z	amikrop	bdelin88	Out of the box image of the product, is marketing.
