2010-09-08T11:24:00.000Z	p1oooop		yes.
2010-09-08T11:25:00.000Z	p1oooop		my network consists of 2 gateways
2010-09-08T11:25:00.000Z	p1oooop		1 leading to the internal network, and another leading to the internal internal network
2010-09-08T11:27:00.000Z	p1oooop		and from my internal internal network, I can ping my internal network, but nothing beyond that...
2010-09-08T11:27:00.000Z	p1oooop		DNS servers included...
2010-09-08T11:27:00.000Z	p1oooop		perhaps it's something wrong with my configuration?
2010-09-08T11:28:00.000Z	iter	p1oooop	your internal internal router needs a route to 0.0.0.0
2010-09-08T11:28:00.000Z	iter	p1oooop	that is to say a default gw
2010-09-08T11:31:00.000Z	p1oooop	iter	you mean my internal router?
2010-09-08T11:35:00.000Z	iter	p1oooop	on the internal internal do 'sudo route add default 192.168.1.1'
2010-09-08T11:35:00.000Z	p1oooop	iter	okay.
2010-09-08T11:36:00.000Z	p1oooop	iter	no such device... 0.o
2010-09-08T11:37:00.000Z	iter	p1oooop	hmm maybe I got syntax wrong-- try 'sudo add default gw 192.168.1.1'
2010-09-08T11:37:00.000Z	iter	p1oooop	you may also want to add the if there at the end, for example eth0
2010-09-08T11:38:00.000Z	p1oooop	iter	okay.
