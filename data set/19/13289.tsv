2005-12-06T08:25:00.000Z	glyph		Hello, folks
2005-12-06T08:25:00.000Z	glyph		My machine is crashing once per day.
2005-12-06T08:26:00.000Z	glyph		Windows seems to be rock solid, Breezy on my laptop is rock solid, and I have no debugging information upon which to base a diagnosis of the problem
2005-12-06T08:26:00.000Z	glyph		but nevertheless Breezy on my desktop is exploding to bits every 16 hours or so, "reliably"
2005-12-06T08:27:00.000Z	thundr	glyph	that's strange.
2005-12-06T08:27:00.000Z	glyph	thundr	Yes, very much so.
2005-12-06T08:28:00.000Z	glyph	thundr	Previously when I've had unexplained crashes in a Linux distro, I've been able to poke around in /var/log and find SOME indication of what happened immediately before the crash...
2005-12-06T08:28:00.000Z	glyph	thundr	but these are hard, fast crashes, that are instantaneous
2005-12-06T08:28:00.000Z	glyph	thundr	no opportunity for the kernel to say "oh crap!" before it dies
2005-12-06T08:28:00.000Z	glyph	thundr	Considering that my machine is already an unstable wreck, I am considering "upgrading" to dapper :)
2005-12-06T08:30:00.000Z	thundr	glyph	yeah.  I know what you're describing, but I doubt I'll be able to help.  Dapper might be a fun experiment - you can watch your computer melt before you format.  :)
2005-12-06T08:30:00.000Z	glyph	thundr	Yeah... I see the topic, and I recognize the sort of grief unprepared dapper users might have caused you all :) but I would like some advice on the recommended upgrade path if anyone here has had good/bad experiences with dapper so far
2005-12-06T08:31:00.000Z	glyph	thundr	I suspect that it is a known kernel bug that has been fixed in versions after the one packaged in breezy.  I mean, heck, practically the whole SCSI system has been replaced since then :-P
2005-12-06T08:32:00.000Z	thundr	glyph	I'm probably not the right person to ask for advice.   People wiser than I will help you when they're done with the problems they're working on.  You might want to try #ubuntu after you register with nickserv - it might be a little faster to get help there.
2005-12-06T08:32:00.000Z	glyph	thundr	erm
2005-12-06T08:33:00.000Z	glyph	thundr	aren't I *in* #ubuntu?
2005-12-06T08:33:00.000Z	glyph	thundr	I am registered, and also, the tab for this channel says "#ubuntu", not "##ubuntu" or anything wacky like that
2005-12-06T08:33:00.000Z	thundr	glyph	oh, yeah.
2005-12-06T08:34:00.000Z	thundr	glyph	This is a new install for me, so I just thought I'd be thrown into #ubuntu-unregged since I didn't put in a password or anything in xchat.
