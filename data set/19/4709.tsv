2009-02-21T12:06:00.000Z	Stueh		Hello, I was hoping someone could help me with a rather unusual problem. Last night in installed the nvidia drivers so that I could have opengl support, and after having done so, I've lost all borders etc. for my windows. I installed a few applications at the same time, but narrowed it down to the nvidia drivers (I uninstall them, problem gone, install them, problem back.)

2009-02-21T12:08:00.000Z	Stueh	hmw	noobie question ... how do I turn off compiz?
2009-02-21T12:08:00.000Z	hmw	Stueh	- i know, thats not the answer, you are looking for. but try it for verifying. install fusion-icon, it lets you switch window manager easily.
2009-02-21T12:09:00.000Z	Stueh	hmw	ok
2009-02-21T12:10:00.000Z	Stueh	hmw	okay, downloading and installing now
2009-02-21T12:12:00.000Z	hmw		Hacker - problem solved?
2009-02-21T12:13:00.000Z	Stueh	hmw	compix fusion-icon will not start. I was going to start it via terminal to see what error it came up with but terminal is just a blank white box,
2009-02-21T12:14:00.000Z	hmw	Stueh	- uhm... i need to goole the command... stand by
2009-02-21T12:15:00.000Z	Stueh	hmw	I found one way to fix it, and while it's not uber technical it works. I went to System > Preferences > Appearance and under Visual Effects tab I changed it to None ...That seems to of fixed it =S
2009-02-21T12:16:00.000Z	hmw	Stueh	- wait... you can also switch it off in the preferences menu... go to "appearance", rightmost tab "interface" ... ah, tahts what i was about to tell yer.
2009-02-21T12:16:00.000Z	Stueh		=D
2009-02-21T12:16:00.000Z	Stueh		Well, I'm happy with that :)
2009-02-21T12:16:00.000Z	Stueh	hmw	I assume I still have opengl support?
2009-02-21T12:16:00.000Z	hmw	Stueh	- you still have a chance to repair your compiz, but i cant really help you. try finding solutions on google, you have a good chance to find something.
2009-02-21T12:17:00.000Z	Stueh		cheers hmw
2009-02-21T12:17:00.000Z	hmw	Stueh	- i honestly dont know.
2009-02-21T12:17:00.000Z	Stueh	hmw	It seems it does not effect opengl. I can play an opengl game with no problem now
2009-02-21T12:18:00.000Z	hmw	Stueh	- btw. you would want to turn off compiz when using 3d apps anyways.
