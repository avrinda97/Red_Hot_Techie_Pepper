2007-09-19T11:39:00.000Z	Veinor		for some reason, at least once a day, my computer almost totally freezes. I can still move the mouse, and even minimize things b clicking on the taskbar, and my wallpaper cron job ran on schedule, but nothing else works. could this be an issue with compiz-fusion, or is it an issue with my drivers?
2007-09-19T11:39:00.000Z	marx2k	Veinor	can you reset the X server?
2007-09-19T11:41:00.000Z	Veinor	marx2k	nothing short of ctrl-alt-sysrq works
2007-09-19T11:42:00.000Z	marx2k	Veinor	Hmmmm I had that problem a few months ago... I wonder... does it happen during network file transfers over NFS by any chance?
2007-09-19T11:42:00.000Z	marx2k	Veinor	also, are you running compiz-fusion?
2007-09-19T11:43:00.000Z	Veinor	marx2k	no and yes, in thar order.
2007-09-19T11:43:00.000Z	marx2k	Veinor	Im trying to remember how I fixed my issue... are you in Gnome on Feisty?
2007-09-19T11:43:00.000Z	Veinor	marx2k	yes
2007-09-19T11:45:00.000Z	Veinor	marx2k	could it be beryl/compiz? or could it be a driver issue?
2007-09-19T11:46:00.000Z	marx2k	Veinor	Well, rule them out one by one... I'd suggest killing your .compiz config dor
2007-09-19T11:46:00.000Z	Veinor	marx2k	or just using metacity instead?
2007-09-19T11:47:00.000Z	marx2k	Veinor	kill your compiz config dir
2007-09-19T11:47:00.000Z	marx2k	Veinor	compiz
2007-09-19T11:49:00.000Z	Veinor	marx2k	ah, you think it might be one of the plugins or something?
2007-09-19T11:49:00.000Z	marx2k	Veinor	probably
2007-09-19T11:51:00.000Z	Veinor	marx2k	is there any sort of log file I could check?
2007-09-19T11:51:00.000Z	marx2k	Veinor	I wish.. I spent days trying to track down a log file that would tell me the deal
2007-09-19T11:56:00.000Z	marx2k	Veinor	Im thinking removing the default config dir and restarting compiz will do it for you
2007-09-19T11:58:00.000Z	marx2k	Veinor	its probably a setting you have/had in the config
