2012-07-25T20:56:00.000Z	mang0_	bobweaver	No luck :/ I just did apt-get update and then checked if your thing was installed (it was) and then rebooted. dmesg says [   75.372118] b43legacy-phy0 ERROR: MAC suspend failed and the normal timeout thing...
2012-07-25T20:59:00.000Z	bobweaver	mang0_	 uninstall and purge th e repo if you like. And Like I was talking about the last time that we talked if this did not work lets just try the b43 all by its lonesome :)     so      sudo apt-get remove bobsdriver firmware-b43legacy && sudo apt-get install firmware-b43-installer
2012-07-25T20:59:00.000Z	bobweaver		make sure you uninstall bobsdriver thou 1st :) or it will not know what to do
2012-07-25T20:59:00.000Z	bobweaver		sorry mang0_  &^^
