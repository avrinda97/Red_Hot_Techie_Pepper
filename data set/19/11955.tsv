2005-11-06T17:12:00.000Z	kevix	Alex_BO2	the problem may be with the film itself. poor resoluton, bad encoding....

2005-11-06T17:15:00.000Z	kevix	Alex_BO2	another thing is if you can take a snapshot of the 'bad' image and post it. so folks can see what you mean.
2005-11-06T17:15:00.000Z	Alex_BO2	kevix	yes, that's a great idea.where can i post a pic?
2005-11-06T17:17:00.000Z	kevix	Alex_BO2	as Seveas said. go to the site, it will have a web page to paste a pic.
2005-11-06T17:21:00.000Z	Alex_BO2	kevix	nooo!!! i can't!!! when i try to take a snapshot, there is a blu image instead of the film!

2005-11-06T17:23:00.000Z	Alex_BO2	kevix	what's that?
2005-11-06T17:23:00.000Z	kevix	Alex_BO2	well you are having a problem with the screen shot. not sure where the problem lies.
2005-11-06T17:33:00.000Z	Alex_BO2	kevix	can be a deinterlacing problem?
2005-11-06T17:34:00.000Z	kevix	Alex_BO2	it maybe , I'm not a video expert.
