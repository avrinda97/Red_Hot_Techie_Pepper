2009-07-15T05:38:00.000Z	mazda01		anyone know why jaunty phpmyadmin doesn't work?
2009-07-15T05:38:00.000Z	mazda01		i installed phpmyadmin in jaunty and created the symlink to /var/www/ but when I use firefox and type in localhost/phpmyadmin it asks about either opening or saving a phtml file. here's the screenshot. http://img12.imageshack.us/my.php?image=screenshot2nrk.png
2009-07-15T05:39:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	mazda01	Yeah, you didn't set a php handler in your apache configuration from the sound of it.
2009-07-15T05:39:00.000Z	mazda01	KB1JWQ	shouldn't that be done by default when I install apache?
2009-07-15T05:40:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	mazda01	Not necessarily.
2009-07-15T05:40:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	mazda01	Note the "bot" part of FloodBot's nickname.
2009-07-15T05:40:00.000Z	mazda01	KB1JWQ	that seems sort of weird. how would the average user know that they have to do all this configuring of apache just to get it to work? I will check out the wiki. thank you
2009-07-15T05:41:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	mazda01	The second part of your line answered the first part.
2009-07-15T05:41:00.000Z	mazda01	KB1JWQ	yeah i know. i figured he was bot but I thought I'd try
2009-07-15T05:46:00.000Z	mazda01	KB1JWQ	i just made sure that libapache2-mod-php5 is installed and it it. I still can't fuigure out why phpmyadmin isn't working.
2009-07-15T05:46:00.000Z	mazda01	KB1JWQ	I don't see how the second line answered the question in line 1 though? I still need help please
2009-07-15T05:46:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	mazda01	Read the documentation. :)
2009-07-15T06:02:00.000Z	mazda01	KB1JWQ	now it says I don't have permission to access this page. can you please help?
2009-07-15T06:02:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	mazda01	Seriously.  Go read, follow the steps it outlines.
2009-07-15T06:03:00.000Z	mazda01	KB1JWQ	i believe I have. I just can't believe there's this much config to get something that seems so easy to work. it seems like i have to know how to build a website just to use phpmyadmin.
2009-07-15T06:04:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	mazda01	Heh, phpmyadmin is a relatively involved web application.
2009-07-15T06:05:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	mazda01	If setting it up is too daunting, I'm not sure what you expect it to be able to do for you; I just access mysql via the CLI.
2009-07-15T06:09:00.000Z	mazda01	KB1JWQ	I have tried that but I don't know all the mysql command to show privileges and create tables and whatnot. I'll keep reading I guess. I am sure I'll figure it out sooner or later. it'll just take me hours instead of minutes if you could tell me what to do. gotta go. thanks anyway.
2009-07-15T06:11:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	mazda01	I'm sure I could set it up faster than you.  But doing it yourself 1. will teach you what you're doing better than having me do it for you, and 2. I don't recall you paying me to do your job for you. :-D
