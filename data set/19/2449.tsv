2010-04-25T17:44:00.000Z	red2kic	JayX	Darik :)
2010-04-25T17:45:00.000Z	JayX	red2kic	yea that dude's name
2010-04-25T17:46:00.000Z	red2kic	JayX	I would imagine they'll try to look at whatever they can find... but not scanning the hard drives and recover whatever and copies them. They're just going to plug the hard drive in and see what shows up in Windows.
2010-04-25T17:47:00.000Z	red2kic	JayX	No. The whole partition would be encrypted and you only have to type password every time you turn on the machine.
2010-04-25T17:48:00.000Z	JayX	red2kic	acicula  Ohh..... encrypting disk sounds good...
2010-04-25T17:48:00.000Z	JayX	red2kic	acicula  can u encrypt the disk and have a dual boot?
2010-04-25T17:48:00.000Z	JayX	red2kic	acicula  Win 7 and Ubuntu 10.04
2010-04-25T17:51:00.000Z	red2kic	JayX	I imagine you could use truecrypt too. I have 20GB HDD (for encrypted /) and 300GB HDD (for encrypted /home). I'm not sure how to dual-boot.
2010-04-25T17:52:00.000Z	red2kic	JayX	Also, I know TrueCrypt do offer full system encryption. It's just easier / cheaper to get another hard drives.
2010-04-25T17:53:00.000Z	JayX	red2kic	 well I got  2x1TB SATA HDD, and oen 250GB IDE/PATA HDD
2010-04-25T17:54:00.000Z	JayX	red2kic	acicula  BTW that reminds me of a question i had asked ealier on the forums... http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1347488  << Answer is still unclear to me
2010-04-25T17:54:00.000Z	red2kic	JayX	Consider buying a smallest HDD you can find (for system core) and the rest? Media. :)
2010-04-25T18:01:00.000Z	JayX	red2kic	 I want to give up Window
2010-04-25T18:02:00.000Z	JayX	red2kic	 should i install Win7  as a VM(to force myself to learn Ubuntu) or should i install Ubuntu as a VM on Win7?  alzamabar
