2006-07-09T12:56:00.000Z	top222		I had fun using a 40MB FAT32 partition on the HD of a laptop, downloading the installer there, and then using a GRUB bootdisk to start the installer.
2006-07-09T12:58:00.000Z	top222		Then it took some hours to download all the packages from the 'net, but the end result was a working Dapper system (not including the Thinkpad-ish problems I had after that).
2006-07-09T12:59:00.000Z	top222		Has anyone thought about a world file for Ubuntu?
2006-07-09T12:59:00.000Z	top222		It means you need, let's say, 10 different programs or packages
2006-07-09T12:59:00.000Z	top222		They pull in some 200 dependencies
2006-07-09T13:00:00.000Z	top222		Then you remove one of those programs, but the dependencies that were there only for that program still remain
2006-07-09T13:00:00.000Z	tritium	top222	using aptitude eliminates that problem
2006-07-09T13:00:00.000Z	top222		Is Aptitude a GUI for apt-get?
2006-07-09T13:01:00.000Z	tritium	top222	not a gui, no
2006-07-09T13:02:00.000Z	top222		How do I get to use aptitude?
2006-07-09T13:02:00.000Z	tritium	top222	it's already installed for you.
2006-07-09T13:02:00.000Z	top222	tritium	Where do I go to specify the packages I really want, to separate them from pure dependencies?
2006-07-09T13:03:00.000Z	top222		Thanks, I'll check that
2006-07-09T13:03:00.000Z	tritium	top222	as I said, aptitude can do that (not retroactively, of course)
2006-07-09T13:03:00.000Z	top222	tritium	Then a world-file-ish functionality would still be an improvement
2006-07-09T13:04:00.000Z	tritium	top222	no, just use aptitude to begin with
2006-07-09T13:04:00.000Z	tritium	top222	there are also deborphan and debfoster
2006-07-09T13:04:00.000Z	top222	tritium	How many people know to do that?
2006-07-09T13:04:00.000Z	tritium	top222	I've never taken a poll
