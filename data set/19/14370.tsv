2005-06-20T09:00:00.000Z	bob2	egabert	er, try again then
2005-06-20T09:00:00.000Z	bob2	egabert	and then come back and explain exactly what happens
2005-06-20T09:01:00.000Z	bob2	egabert	you're being too vague
2005-06-20T09:01:00.000Z	bob2	egabert	what happens when you try to run xterm from a terminal? what error do you get?
2005-06-20T09:01:00.000Z	bob2	egabert	did you REALLY follow the instructions?
2005-06-20T09:05:00.000Z	bob2	egabert	please don't /msg me
2005-06-20T09:21:00.000Z	bob2	egabert	please stop it
2005-06-20T09:22:00.000Z	bob2	egabert	please don't /msg me
2005-06-20T09:22:00.000Z	bob2	egabert	you haven't given enough information for anyone to help you, and your attitude isn't very enticing
2005-06-20T09:24:00.000Z	bob2	egabert	that's not your result
2005-06-20T09:24:00.000Z	bob2	egabert	presumably somthing isn't working, why don't you tell us what?
2005-06-20T09:26:00.000Z	bob2	egabert	dude
2005-06-20T09:26:00.000Z	bob2	egabert	all we know is what you tell us
2005-06-20T09:26:00.000Z	bob2	egabert	and you haven't even explained what isn't working yet
2005-06-20T09:29:00.000Z	bob2	egabert	this is an english channel
2005-06-20T09:29:00.000Z	bob2	egabert	#ubuntu.de or -de
