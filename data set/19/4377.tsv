2009-01-27T00:20:00.000Z	lilendian_G	wolter	finally. got it fixed. But now I have this one problem, I cant log back in to my own user because it gives off an 'no input supported' error
2009-01-27T00:20:00.000Z	lilendian_G		Is there a bleeping config file I can edit to fix my resolution settings?
2009-01-27T00:20:00.000Z	wolter	lilendian_G	wait, how did you fix it?
2009-01-27T00:20:00.000Z	wolter	lilendian_G	and, you can't log in?
2009-01-27T00:21:00.000Z	lilendian_G		well, turns out that the wrong kernel interface was installed. and I had it all mixed up- All i really had to do was uninstall that and once again reinstall the binary nvidia drivers.
2009-01-27T00:22:00.000Z	lilendian_G		I had done it so many times, I actually lost track of it - and the last time I did uninstall it, it hadn't completed before I terminated the process.
2009-01-27T00:23:00.000Z	lilendian_G	wolter	so the question remains, there must be be some local user config thats messing up my login. gdm runs fine- good resolution. But as soon as I log in, i have no input signal supported.
2009-01-27T00:23:00.000Z	lilendian_G		Where'd I go to change that?
2009-01-27T00:23:00.000Z	lilendian_G		i believe its the one set from gnome-display-settings
2009-01-27T00:24:00.000Z	wolter	lilendian_G	are you logging into another user?
2009-01-27T00:24:00.000Z	wolter	lilendian_G	oh
2009-01-27T00:24:00.000Z	lilendian_G		yeah, i've had two users. this is just a temporary one though.
2009-01-27T00:24:00.000Z	wolter	lilendian_G	well, i would suggest you to create a new user, and if that user works for you, then you should probably delete the configurations at home that relate to input and video stuff
2009-01-27T00:25:00.000Z	wolter	lilendian_G	then try to log into your old user
2009-01-27T00:25:00.000Z	lilendian_G	wolter	yeah, but what? i've already looked in .gnome2 and gnome2_private.
2009-01-27T00:25:00.000Z	lilendian_G		nothing in there that remotely registers with screen resolution / x config
2009-01-27T00:26:00.000Z	wolter	lilendian_G	no problem.. save all the configs of your applications you want (or even better, move all your directory to another one, for example $ mv /home/lilendian /home/lilendian/backup
2009-01-27T00:26:00.000Z	wolter	lilendian_G	and relog/log
2009-01-27T00:27:00.000Z	wolter	lilendian_G	the system will create a default configuration for you
