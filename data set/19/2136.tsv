2011-10-11T12:23:00.000Z	jpohl		my ubuntu hangs for about four minutes before it finally boots
2011-10-11T12:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jpohl	once you get booted, run:  dmesg | less     and read through, look for large gaps in the left colomn (those are seconds since the kernel came up)
2011-10-11T12:26:00.000Z	jpohl	ActionParsnip	the very last line is only at 41.95
2011-10-11T12:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jpohl	any large gaps though?
2011-10-11T12:28:00.000Z	jpohl	ActionParsnip	no more than 17 seconds
2011-10-11T12:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jpohl	hmm, strange. Is the RAM healthy?
2011-10-11T12:31:00.000Z	jpohl	ActionParsnip	1.5 GB, i just ran memtest a few days ago
2011-10-11T12:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jpohl	so the dmesg is quite quick, what GPU do you use?
2011-10-11T12:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jpohl	ok thats cool :)
2011-10-11T12:31:00.000Z	jpohl	ActionParsnip	it seems like the hang occurs while unpacking the initrd
2011-10-11T12:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jpohl	could try reinstalling the linux-image-2.x.x.x   see if it helps
2011-10-11T12:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jpohl	uname -r   will show the kernel version
2011-10-11T12:33:00.000Z	jpohl	ActionParsnip	kernel is 2.6.38-11-generic
2011-10-11T12:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jpohl	sudo apt-get --reinstall install 2.6.38-11-generic
2011-10-11T12:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jpohl	and do as arghx says too :)
2011-10-11T12:36:00.000Z	jpohl	ActionParsnip	arghx: will do
2011-10-11T12:59:00.000Z	jpohl	ActionParsnip	arghx: at least one of you was right... whatever I just did solved the problem, thanks!
2011-10-11T12:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jpohl	sweet
2011-10-11T12:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jpohl	thats all we want :)
