2008-05-31T22:42:00.000Z	[KS]`	soundray	none
2008-05-31T22:43:00.000Z	soundray	[KS]`	sorry, I have to give up. Do head over to tuxmobil.org , though, like I said earlier, there are bound to be people  who have solved this problem on your very model
2008-05-31T22:44:00.000Z	[KS]`	soundray	I've been there, there is no my model :(
2008-05-31T22:44:00.000Z	soundray	[KS]`	did you get the latest driver with usser's help?
2008-05-31T22:45:00.000Z	[KS]`	soundray	yes, last night
2008-05-31T22:45:00.000Z	soundray	[KS]`	have you checked the BIOS setup for an enabling switch?
2008-05-31T22:46:00.000Z	[KS]`	soundray	yes, no option
2008-05-31T22:48:00.000Z	soundray	[KS]`	sorry. I think the best hope is to wait for a new driver version
2008-05-31T22:50:00.000Z	[KS]`	soundray	I got it!
2008-05-31T22:50:00.000Z	soundray	[KS]`	what?!
2008-05-31T22:50:00.000Z	[KS]`	soundray	now that you mentioned BIOS, I remembered that I read somewhere, that Restoring bios defaults should help. And it did. Even my bluetooth is working now!
