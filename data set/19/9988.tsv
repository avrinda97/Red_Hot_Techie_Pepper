2007-01-11T17:29:00.000Z	pebblestone		Hi, I have a question. I need to rebuild apache2 because Virtualmin needs suexec builded with homedir=/home. I downloaded apache 2.2.4 and used "./configure --with-suexec-docroot=/home && make && make install". but the problem is, after I restart apache2, it's still the old version. What's wrong with my process?
2007-01-11T17:29:00.000Z	kjaer	pebblestone	use the --prefix option to ./configure and install into /opt
2007-01-11T17:47:00.000Z	pebblestone	kjaer	it's not working. what's interesting is that I've already removed apache2.
2007-01-11T17:47:00.000Z	kjaer	pebblestone	Any errors ?
