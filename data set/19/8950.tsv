2011-12-06T22:45:00.000Z	Pici	batlock	This channel is for support only. If you want to have a duscussion, use #ubuntu-offtopic
2011-12-06T22:46:00.000Z	Pici	batlock	"discussing ubuntu related issues" would be discussion, not asking for ubuntu related support. You just said that.
2011-12-06T22:46:00.000Z	Pici	batlock	But as you can see, this channel is very busy, so we try to keep all discussion in another channel so that people can get help here without all sorts of other noise.
2011-12-06T22:50:00.000Z	Pici	batlock	What release of Ubuntu are you using?
2011-12-06T22:51:00.000Z	Pici	batlock	Did the instruction for !classic not help?
2011-12-06T22:54:00.000Z	Pici	batlock	I'm trying to find the config file that stores what starts up from GDM, one moment.
2012-05-09T22:51:00.000Z	Pici	batlock	Ubuntu and Debian are not the same thing. We cannot help you here.
2012-05-09T22:55:00.000Z	Pici	batlock	tiny_fan_, krababbel: Debian support is offtopic for this channel. If you want to help him, feel free to join #debian. Otherwise, I'm going to have to ask again that we stay on-topic here.
