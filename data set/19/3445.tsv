2010-03-12T20:13:00.000Z	PSPdemon		but ofcourse if what you are asking is
2010-03-12T20:14:00.000Z	PSPdemon		"can i boot into my windows partition via linux and vice versa without rebooting"
2010-03-12T20:14:00.000Z	PSPdemon		thats a no
2010-03-12T20:16:00.000Z	PSPdemon		meh....looks like my question is too specific/technicaly to come up with a answer :/
2010-03-12T20:18:00.000Z	DarkStar	PSPdemon	do you meand load windows or access your windowsdirectory
2010-03-12T20:18:00.000Z	PSPdemon	DarkStar	neither
2010-03-12T20:18:00.000Z	DarkStar	PSPdemon	sorry for the typos
2010-03-12T20:18:00.000Z	PSPdemon		my question was is there a way to browse the repo's for armv6 built debs
2010-03-12T20:18:00.000Z	PSPdemon		or a place to get armv6 debs
2010-03-12T20:19:00.000Z	PSPdemon		debian's arm builds are based around armv4
2010-03-12T20:19:00.000Z	PSPdemon		and ubuntu supposedly has armv6
2010-03-12T20:19:00.000Z	PSPdemon		but their site doesnt list the arm arch debs so i can access them via packages.ubuntu
2010-03-12T20:20:00.000Z	DarkStar	PSPdemon	I only browsed as far as your last question which was about booting into windows fom Linux and vice versa
2010-03-12T20:20:00.000Z	PSPdemon	DarkStar	that wasnt my question
2010-03-12T20:20:00.000Z	PSPdemon		that was a answer to a question
2010-03-12T20:20:00.000Z	PSPdemon		<Zenker> can i switch between ubuntu and windows without shutting one down and starting the other?
2010-03-12T20:20:00.000Z	PSPdemon		that was the question asked that i answered :P
2010-03-12T20:21:00.000Z	DarkStar	PSPdemon	My apologies
