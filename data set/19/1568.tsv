2011-01-04T20:19:00.000Z	phpjim		can anyone tell me why my gnome panel looks gray and lame like this screenshot: http://tinypic.com/r/1r6wjd/7   versus sexy in the images here: http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop     running ubuntu 10.10...  have tried changing gtk2 themes but the gnome panel won't change from its current look....
2011-01-04T20:21:00.000Z	h-dee	phpjim	I just tried solving it for one person today. Its a bug. Either you're on high processor such as core i7
2011-01-04T20:21:00.000Z	h-dee	phpjim	or using NVIDIA card
2011-01-04T20:21:00.000Z	phpjim	h-dee	indeed..  I'm high on processors babeee..
2011-01-04T20:21:00.000Z	phpjim	h-dee	and in deed I am using an nvidia card..
2011-01-04T20:21:00.000Z	h-dee	phpjim	kill the gnome-settings-daemon and restart it
2011-01-04T20:22:00.000Z	phpjim	h-dee	you beast..
2011-01-04T20:22:00.000Z	phpjim	h-dee	that worked..
2011-01-04T20:23:00.000Z	phpjim	h-dee	I wonder why restarting never fixed the issue if that's what it took?
2011-01-04T20:23:00.000Z	h-dee	phpjim	hey, listen...that might be temporary because its a bug.
2011-01-04T20:23:00.000Z	h-dee	phpjim	check http://askubuntu.com/questions/11406/gnome-settings-daemon-doesnt-apply-themes-unless-i-kill-it-and-start-it-manuall
2011-01-04T20:24:00.000Z	phpjim	h-dee	yeah.. the install of this machine was a pain..  the video card is rather tame nvidia in my opinion...  but I had video problems after the install (had to edit my grub config to get something going so I could fix the video modes)
2011-01-04T20:24:00.000Z	h-dee	phpjim	maybe the next Ubuntu release will fix it. You just got to hold on to your seat for a while. :-)
2011-01-04T20:24:00.000Z	phpjim	h-dee	and I fall into the criteria for the bug 100% (6 core i7, SSD, nvidia)
2011-01-04T20:25:00.000Z	phpjim	h-dee	dude... it's not like I planned on restarting anytime soon.. I should be good for a while
2011-01-04T20:25:00.000Z	h-dee	phpjim	that's how I pointed out that u got high processor and NVIDIA ;-)
2011-01-04T20:25:00.000Z	h-dee	phpjim	use hibernation :-D
2011-01-04T20:27:00.000Z	phpjim	h-dee	alright.. thanks for the help
2011-01-04T20:28:00.000Z	h-dee	phpjim	your welcome bud! :-)
