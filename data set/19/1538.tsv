I am trying to install Ubuntu on my laptop and have created a USB bootable, however just discovered my bios does not support USB booting. Figured Id make a CD but the CD drive is not being detected, powers up and ejects etc just isnt shown on the PC

2010-12-30T13:53:00.000Z	adds	Doinkle	nope
2010-12-30T13:53:00.000Z	Doinkle	adds	you have a few options...
2010-12-30T13:54:00.000Z	Doinkle	adds	1. enter bios and 100% confirm the boot order is there for cd and usb.  also confirm the BIOS sees the CDrom
2010-12-30T13:55:00.000Z	Doinkle	adds	 if you don't have any luck at all, you can install ubuntu to that hdd by removing it.. and either use another laptop with that hdd or a usb > 2.5" adapter
2010-12-30T13:56:00.000Z	Doinkle	adds	yet another way is if you can boot over ethernet.
2010-12-30T13:57:00.000Z	adds	Doinkle	it allows boot over LAN
2010-12-30T13:57:00.000Z	Doinkle	adds	if you have another computer available up and running you can install over ethernet
2010-12-30T13:57:00.000Z	Doinkle	adds	google for install ubuntu over ethernet
