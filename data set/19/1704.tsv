2011-05-06T10:04:00.000Z	mentoc		I have everything mounted on one hard drive (mounted as /) is it possible to change a directory to mount on my unused SSD drive?
2011-05-06T10:05:00.000Z	genewitch	mentoc	you'd have to rsync the directory onto the ssd in a mount point, unmount the ssd, delete the directory you want it to replace, then mkdir the name, and then mount /dev/(whatever ssd is) /(whatever folder you want)
2011-05-06T10:06:00.000Z	genewitch	mentoc	then you have to edit /etc/fstab to reflect your changes so it keeps it on boot
2011-05-06T10:06:00.000Z	mentoc	genewitch	So basically copy everything over that I want mounted on the new drive, and edit fstab.. i see.
2011-05-06T10:07:00.000Z	genewitch	mentoc	yesir. what folder are you wanting to be on the ssd?
2011-05-06T10:08:00.000Z	mentoc	genewitch	I'm thinking /home but I'm trying to figure out which folders use up more space
2011-05-06T10:08:00.000Z	genewitch	mentoc	look up how mount works, you might just be able to mount /dev/(ssd) /home
2011-05-06T10:08:00.000Z	genewitch	mentoc	maybe. don't quote me.
2011-05-06T10:09:00.000Z	genewitch	mentoc	i know you can do that with portage temp dirs in gentoo
2011-05-06T10:09:00.000Z	mentoc	genewitch	That seems like it would mount the contents of /dev/sd(x) onto /home instead of vice versa
2011-05-06T10:10:00.000Z	genewitch	mentoc	yeah. i'd just move everything. the home stuff isn't system critical anyhow.
2011-05-06T10:10:00.000Z	mentoc	genewitch	It seems /usr/ would be a fine move since most binaries are there including libraries
2011-05-06T10:11:00.000Z	genewitch	mentoc	in all honesty, if it were me i'd do a reinstall and set up the partitioning at the beginning
2011-05-06T10:11:00.000Z	mentoc	genewitch	:) I'm too happy with the work I've puut into this install so far :P
2011-05-06T10:11:00.000Z	mentoc	genewitch	well, except for the mounting issue lol
2011-05-06T10:13:00.000Z	genewitch	mentoc	mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/ssd && rsync -avHx /home /mnt/ssd && sync;sync;sync;sync && umount /mnt/ssd && rm -rF /home && mkdir /home && mount /dev/sdb1 /home
2011-05-06T10:13:00.000Z	genewitch	mentoc	replace the /dev/sdb1 with whatever your ssd is.
2011-05-06T10:14:00.000Z	mentoc	genewitch	Nice one liner. I'll copy that with screen :) Thanks for the help.
2011-05-06T10:15:00.000Z	genewitch	mentoc	it may not work like that, because something in /home might be in use or something
