2011-07-18T11:37:00.000Z	nkh		hi every body! any one can help me for an easy way to upgrade my gcc to 4.6 in Lucid ?
2011-07-18T11:38:00.000Z	nkh		I'm in a hury unfortunately :|
2011-07-18T11:38:00.000Z	nkh		Is there any repo to add and apt-get it to do all? I also need g++ to be the same version
2011-07-18T11:39:00.000Z	nkh		So gcc and g++ 4.6
2011-07-18T11:39:00.000Z	nkh		any help!?
2011-07-18T11:39:00.000Z	flexy	nkh	source...
2011-07-18T11:39:00.000Z	flexy	nkh	install from source...
2011-07-18T11:39:00.000Z	flexy		How do I set sda to have deadline scheduler right at boot, so that the rest of the disks still get cfg scheduler? (I have ssd as sda, other drives are normal spindles...)
2011-07-18T11:39:00.000Z	flexy		I know the elevator=deadline line to /etc/default/grub GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT... but it changes the default elevator. The rest of the disks get the same elevator. I could echo to /sys/block/... at boot time, but then when usb hdds are attached, they too get the deadline elevator...
2011-07-18T11:40:00.000Z	nkh	flexy	Ok which sources I should get !? for both g++ and gcc ?
2011-07-18T11:40:00.000Z	nkh	flexy	can you lead me a link?
2011-07-18T11:40:00.000Z	flexy	nkh	sure, compile and install
2011-07-18T11:40:00.000Z	flexy	nkh	no, but google is your friend
2011-07-18T11:40:00.000Z	flexy	nkh	there might be a repo also, but I don't know about those
2011-07-18T11:40:00.000Z	nkh	flexy	yes you right I'm in hury and I can't think on what i say :D
2011-07-18T11:41:00.000Z	nkh	flexy	Hmmm tnx
2011-07-18T11:43:00.000Z	nkh	flexy	one another Q ! does g++ have another source for itself ? or gcc contains g++ ?
2011-07-18T11:44:00.000Z	flexy	nkh	don't know about that.
2011-07-18T11:44:00.000Z	nkh	flexy	Thanks
