2009-07-02T08:50:00.000Z	edbian	forces	It was released yesterday for windows
2009-07-02T08:52:00.000Z	edbian	forces	Right to the point aren't we?  Do you know what the repos are??
2009-07-02T08:52:00.000Z	edbian	forces	Then I'm assuming you can install open-office.
2009-07-02T08:53:00.000Z	edbian	forces	Are you sure you want these on hardy?
2009-07-02T08:53:00.000Z	edbian	forces	If you simply upgrade to 9.04 you'll have open office 3 and flash 10 will be in your repos.
2009-07-02T08:55:00.000Z	edbian	forces	 Check out backporting.  It allows you to get packages from repos that are newer than your current ubuntu version's repos.

2009-07-24T03:58:00.000Z	edbian	forces	Search synaptic.
2009-07-24T03:58:00.000Z	forces	edbian	search what? more than 15,000 packages
2009-07-24T03:59:00.000Z	edbian	forces	I think the ubuntu notifications are part of the ubuntu-desktop package
