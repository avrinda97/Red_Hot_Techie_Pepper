2010-04-30T03:15:00.000Z	bappy2		i'm on hardy LTS, but update manager doesn't show me the option to upgrade to Lucid. is that the intended behavior ?
2010-04-30T03:16:00.000Z	sebsebseb	bappy2	it should show it, also if you upgrade now well good luck, since the amount of other people doing Lucid
2010-04-30T03:16:00.000Z	sebsebseb	bappy2	also in certain ways Hardy is actsaully better than Lucid
2010-04-30T03:16:00.000Z	sebsebseb	bappy2	plus no Ext4 file system or Grub 2, when upgrading Hardy to Lucid, but you don't really need those anyway
2010-04-30T03:17:00.000Z	bappy2	sebsebseb	i do have a few things broken on hardy, which is part of the reason why i want to upgrade to LucidGUI
2010-04-30T03:17:00.000Z	sebsebseb	bappy2	things that are broken such as?
2010-04-30T03:18:00.000Z	bappy2	sebsebseb	i'm missing a few .so files in my /usr/lib directory
2010-04-30T03:18:00.000Z	sebsebseb	bappy2	why?
2010-04-30T03:18:00.000Z	sebsebseb	bappy2	ok yes maybe upgrade will put that back or not, but  10.04 is a good one to clean install really since what I mentioned about Ext4 file system
2010-04-30T03:18:00.000Z	sebsebseb	bappy2	even though it's not really needed
2010-04-30T03:20:00.000Z	bappy2	sebsebseb	what about ext4 and grub2? i didn't quite understand you the first time
2010-04-30T03:20:00.000Z	sebsebseb	bappy2	Do you know what a file system is?  Do you know what a boot loader is?
2010-04-30T03:20:00.000Z	bappy2	sebsebseb	i do, but i didnt get that part of why b/c of those two things i should do a clean install
2010-04-30T03:27:00.000Z	sebsebseb	bappy2	Lucid is LTS so it should show
2010-04-30T03:28:00.000Z	sebsebseb	bappy2	elie-m is wrong
2010-04-30T03:28:00.000Z	sebsebseb	bappy2	you can't just directly upgrade hardy to karmic
2010-04-30T03:29:00.000Z	sebsebseb	bappy2	nevermind turns out I read what elie-m  put wrong
2010-04-30T03:29:00.000Z	bappy2	sebsebseb	ok, i'm confused now :)
2010-04-30T03:29:00.000Z	sebsebseb	bappy2	you  should be able to directly upgrade a LTS to the next LTS
