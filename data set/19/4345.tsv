2009-04-09T14:34:00.000Z	brEz-		question: I run a program on linux, that was built for windows initially, but now also has linux support - the default beahviour of the perogram is to go to the "notification area" when minimized on windows; however when I do this on on ubuntu, it acts the same, but I can't see the icon. I have to kill the process and restart the program again
2009-04-09T14:35:00.000Z	ikonia	brEz-	what program
2009-04-09T14:35:00.000Z	ikonia	brEz-	what program
2009-04-09T14:35:00.000Z	ikonia	brEz-	what program
2009-04-09T14:35:00.000Z	brEz-	ikonia	I said, it's a 2D game I play.
2009-04-09T14:36:00.000Z	ikonia	brEz-	what program
2009-04-09T14:36:00.000Z	ikonia	brEz-	what is the name of the program / where did you get it
2009-04-09T14:36:00.000Z	brEz-	ikonia	it's called spark, a clone of Siera's game A.R.C
2009-04-09T14:37:00.000Z	ikonia	brEz-	where did you get it ?
2009-04-09T14:37:00.000Z	brEz-	ikonia	spark-hq.net
2009-04-09T14:39:00.000Z	ikonia	brEz-	looking at the contents of the zip file for the linux version, it doesn't appear to be "desktop" aware, which is why you're not seeing it in your desktop when minimised
2009-04-09T14:39:00.000Z	ikonia	brEz-	I'd ask the spark support process
2009-04-09T14:39:00.000Z	brEz-	ikonia	thanks for looking into it, I've tried - there response is "it works"
2009-04-09T14:40:00.000Z	brEz-	ikonia	the whole community runs windows, there is only few who have linux.
2009-04-09T14:40:00.000Z	ikonia	brEz-	maybe explain it a little more detail, eg: the desktop your using, the distro, the versions, even to the point of the theme you're using
2009-04-09T14:41:00.000Z	ikonia	brEz-	no, I mean explain to them
2009-04-09T14:41:00.000Z	ikonia	brEz-	if you log the bug they can investigate
2009-04-09T14:42:00.000Z	ikonia	brEz-	game over then
