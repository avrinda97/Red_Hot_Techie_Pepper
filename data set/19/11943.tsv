2006-02-26T12:33:00.000Z	linuxboyfriend		can anyone else tell me, how can i put a script in system startup?
2006-02-26T12:34:00.000Z	LjL	linuxboyfriend	man update-rc.d
2006-02-26T12:34:00.000Z	LjL	linuxboyfriend	not as easy at editing autoexec.bat, mind you
2006-02-26T12:37:00.000Z	LjL	linuxboyfriend	basically you need to create a script in /etc/init.d/, which can take a "start", "stop" or "restart" argument, and then use update.rc-d to register that script
2006-03-08T09:59:00.000Z	LjL	linuxboyfriend	try "sudo aptitude install x-window-system-dev"
2006-03-08T10:01:00.000Z	linuxboyfriend	LjL	is that OK http://pastebin.com/582016
2006-03-08T10:02:00.000Z	LjL	linuxboyfriend	no, it doesn't seem very right. does "apt-cache policy x-window-system-dev" show anything under "Installed:" ?

2006-03-08T10:05:00.000Z	linuxboyfriend	LjL	I am trying to solve this for the last two hours :(
2006-03-08T10:05:00.000Z	LjL	linuxboyfriend	what program are you trying to compile?
2006-03-08T10:06:00.000Z	linuxboyfriend	LjL	its one of my economics related software
2006-03-08T10:06:00.000Z	linuxboyfriend	LjL	now! do you have any idea whats going wrong?
2006-03-08T10:07:00.000Z	LjL	linuxboyfriend	no. the configure is complaining about missing X headers, but if you have x-window-system-dev installed (which you do), you have the headers
2006-03-08T10:08:00.000Z	linuxboyfriend	LjL	then how can I tell configure script about that?
2006-03-08T10:09:00.000Z	LjL	linuxboyfriend	it really depends on the program...
2006-03-08T10:11:00.000Z	linuxboyfriend	LjL	ok leave it, i wanna ask one more thank, I was thinking that whethe it is possible to install kde-3.5 via apt
2006-03-08T10:11:00.000Z	LjL	linuxboyfriend	yes it is, see kubuntu.org for the repositories
2006-03-08T10:11:00.000Z	linuxboyfriend	LjL	ok thanks
2006-03-08T10:12:00.000Z	LjL	linuxboyfriend	if the program you're compiling is open-source and all, i can try it here.
