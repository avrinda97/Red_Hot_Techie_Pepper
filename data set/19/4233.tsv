2009-03-01T15:04:00.000Z	n2diy		I archived my home directory, moved it to my test, box, extracted it, and I I end up with /home/me, and home/me(2), am I doing something wrong?
2009-03-01T15:06:00.000Z	sprinkmeier	n2diy	which tools did you use to archive/exrtact? looks like the extract tool saw the existing directory and tried to be 'helpful'
2009-03-01T15:07:00.000Z	n2diy	sprinkmeier	what ever Nautilus uses when you right click on a dir?
2009-03-01T15:08:00.000Z	sprinkmeier	n2diy	OK... I think that's a case of the extracter being too helpful, refusing to clobber the existing directory, hence the (2) one. Can you move the files you want from ...(2) to ...?
2009-03-01T15:10:00.000Z	n2diy	sprinkmeier	I suppose I could? I was wondering if I could delete /home/me, then extract the archive, would /home/me be rebuilt? /home has it's own partition, on both boxes.
2009-03-01T15:11:00.000Z	sprinkmeier	n2diy	that should work, assuming there's nothing in the old /home you want to keep (i.e. BACK IT UP just in case). Also, are both systems runing the same distro? lots of config files get dumped in ~, and if you're moving from one distro to another (with different versions of apps) you could break things
2009-03-01T15:12:00.000Z	n2diy	sprinkmeier	fine business, it is a test box, so no worries about losing stuff, and yes, both are running Hardy.
2009-03-01T15:23:00.000Z	n2diy	sprinkmeier	quibbler , I trashed /home/me, extracxted the archive, and /home/me was recreated!
2009-03-01T15:31:00.000Z	sprinkmeier	n2diy	gnome virtual filesystem. It's a way of network mounting windows boxes (among other things)
2009-03-01T16:39:00.000Z	sprinkmeier	n2diy	so test machine now has a fresh, clean homedirectory, and X still won't work.... error messages?
2009-03-01T16:45:00.000Z	n2diy	sprinkmeier	yes, the first message is about my /home/.dmrc file, which is being ignored, I must own the file, and I must own my home directory. The second message states "unable to lock file /home/me/ICEauthority, and I should report it as a bug. Of course I won't do that, as I'm the bug. :)
2009-03-01T16:46:00.000Z	sprinkmeier	n2diy	sounds like the name is the same, but the UID/GID are mismatched (i.e. just because the directory is called /home/foo does not give user 'foo' access to it, the UID/GID have to match). chown --recursive uid.gid /home/foo is a ham-fisted way to change uids, might fix your peoblem
2009-03-01T16:47:00.000Z	n2diy	sprinkmeier	ok, I'll give it a try.
2009-03-01T16:56:00.000Z	n2diy	sprinkmeier	ok, that did the trick, it wasn't the precise command syntax, but close enough for me to figure it out, thanks.
2009-03-01T17:19:00.000Z	n2diy	sprinkmeier	 are you still here?
2009-03-15T11:39:00.000Z	n2diy	sprinkmeier	how do you backup your stuff without /home?
2009-03-15T11:43:00.000Z	sprinkmeier	n2diy	I use backuppc to do all my backups and occasionally copy the tarballs to an external drive
2009-03-15T11:44:00.000Z	n2diy	sprinkmeier	have you ueed sbackup?
2009-03-15T11:46:00.000Z	sprinkmeier	n2diy	no. link? gotta go run an errand, back in a while
