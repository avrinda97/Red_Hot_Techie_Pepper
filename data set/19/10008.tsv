2007-06-15T13:57:00.000Z	perlmonkey		ive been running ubuntu for 2-3 weeks now
2007-06-15T13:58:00.000Z	perlmonkey		gnome seems much slower than debian, but on the positive side alot of stuff works out of the box better
2007-06-15T13:59:00.000Z	perlmonkey		gnome on Ubuntu is noticeably slower than gnome on Debian
2007-06-15T14:00:00.000Z	perlmonkey		Ubuntu's gnome seems to be a little bloated
2007-06-15T14:00:00.000Z	perlmonkey		but I have no problems running xfce4 under Ubuntu
2007-06-15T14:00:00.000Z	perlmonkey		ok
2007-06-15T14:00:00.000Z	perlmonkey		ubuntu looks promising so far
2007-06-15T14:01:00.000Z	perlmonkey		ya
2007-06-15T14:01:00.000Z	perlmonkey		ubuntu experience under gnome seems to be closer to windows
2007-06-15T14:01:00.000Z	perlmonkey		its definitely easier to use and more user friendly than debian
2007-06-15T14:02:00.000Z	ivx	perlmonkey	that's the idea, but don't forget where ubuntu came from
2007-06-15T14:02:00.000Z	perlmonkey		and dont forget where debian came from too ;-)
2007-06-15T14:03:00.000Z	perlmonkey		i did consider running freebsd before i decided to go with ubuntu
2007-06-15T14:03:00.000Z	ivx	perlmonkey	you mean mostly GNU?
2007-06-15T14:03:00.000Z	perlmonkey		well debian is based on bsd
2007-06-15T14:03:00.000Z	ivx	perlmonkey	what? who said that?
2007-06-15T14:03:00.000Z	perlmonkey		everyone knows it
2007-06-15T14:04:00.000Z	perlmonkey	_phreaky	gdm?
2007-06-15T14:04:00.000Z	ivx	perlmonkey	ubuntu and debian is a make up of GNU with linux kernal and some other stuff, GNU is not unix
