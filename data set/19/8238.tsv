2007-10-14T13:50:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	underwatercow	ya, i just have always foudn the man pages  pretty informative.
2007-10-14T13:50:00.000Z	underwatercow	IndyGunFreak	I do too... but this program isn't very well documented...

2008-02-03T12:04:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	underwatercow	everyone with sense doesn't
2008-02-03T12:07:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	underwatercow	well, why can't you get webcam support, there's a few out there that supposedly work(i say supposedly, because i have no experience w/ them)
2008-02-03T12:08:00.000Z	underwatercow	IndyGunFreak	I want it in pidgin... aMSN supports it I know...
2008-02-03T12:09:00.000Z	underwatercow	IndyGunFreak	lol... I thought they were supposed to be adding it at some point

2008-02-03T12:10:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	underwatercow	 i think a lot of stuff got thrown off track when they were forced to switch from GAIM to pidgin, and dealing with that whole mess
2008-02-03T12:36:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	underwatercow	?... why so long
2008-02-03T12:37:00.000Z	underwatercow	IndyGunFreak	lol, because I had some password issues in samba.
2008-02-03T12:37:00.000Z	underwatercow	IndyGunFreak	I can't even remember now what I did... but I had to use smbpasswd for something
2008-02-20T23:03:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	underwatercow	well, if you have a system w/ low resources, alt. install cd is good.
2008-02-20T23:03:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	underwatercow	minimal install cd is different from alt. install.
2008-02-20T23:04:00.000Z	underwatercow	IndyGunFreak	I thought a minimal install was done from the alt.
2008-02-20T23:04:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	underwatercow	not that i know of.
