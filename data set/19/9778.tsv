2006-12-16T17:20:00.000Z	Lynoure	theclaw	I think there are a lot of front-ends in debian too. But yes, first one has to find them
2006-12-16T17:21:00.000Z	theclaw	Lynoure	hrm
2006-12-16T17:21:00.000Z	Lynoure	theclaw	But yes, the out-of-box configuration is less hassle in ubuntu
2006-12-16T17:22:00.000Z	theclaw	Lynoure	well, a think a lot of frontends do the whole configuration thing aself rathern than changing the distribution-specific configuration files (/etc/network/interfaces in debian/ubuntu for example)
2006-12-16T17:22:00.000Z	theclaw	Lynoure	in ubunut 6.06 it worked *flawlessly*!
2006-12-16T17:23:00.000Z	Lynoure	theclaw	for me, and for you. But not for all. Helps to have Linux friendly hardware to start with. :)
2006-12-16T17:25:00.000Z	theclaw	Lynoure	my hardware supports wpa under linux (ipw3945)
2006-12-16T17:25:00.000Z	theclaw	Lynoure	everything what needs to be done is starting/configuring wpa_supplicant, thats my prob :/
2006-12-16T17:27:00.000Z	Lynoure	theclaw	yep, network-manager is by far the easiest way to do it. In my case, install, comment out stuff from /etc/network/interfaces and it was done. But if you need static ips that are not given to you by dhcp, I guess that takes more work
2006-12-16T17:28:00.000Z	theclaw	Lynoure	hmm why do i have to comment out the stuff from "interfaces"?
2006-12-16T17:28:00.000Z	Lynoure	theclaw	because it works? :)
2006-12-16T17:29:00.000Z	theclaw	Lynoure	this answer sucks ;)
2006-12-16T17:30:00.000Z	Lynoure	theclaw	I did not go digging in the code for the reason
2006-12-16T17:30:00.000Z	Lynoure	theclaw	see http://www.lynoure.org/blog/index.php?/archives/76-Solving-the-common-NetworkManager-problem.html for what I mean
2006-12-16T17:31:00.000Z	Lynoure	theclaw	it seemed to be common enough problem to merit blogging about :(  Yes. I would prefer it not to need that, but I do not maintain that package
2006-12-16T17:31:00.000Z	theclaw	Lynoure	hrm
2006-12-16T17:32:00.000Z	theclaw	Lynoure	okay i see
2006-12-16T17:32:00.000Z	theclaw	Lynoure	that definitly sucks
2006-12-16T17:33:00.000Z	Lynoure	theclaw	well, it's not a unrecoverable change, nor require memorizing lines and lines of options. So could be worse. Trying it only takes a min or two
