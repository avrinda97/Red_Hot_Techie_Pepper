2008-04-28T02:21:00.000Z	nhuyanhuk		hey guys, do you think i should uninstall FF 3 ?
2008-04-28T02:22:00.000Z	errpast	nhuyanhuk	depends. Do you use a lot of extensions that might not be supported?
2008-04-28T02:22:00.000Z	errpast	nhuyanhuk	ah ha. I need to go back to ff2 for my fave extension. vimperator
2008-04-28T02:23:00.000Z	errpast	nhuyanhuk	I was told here just to install ff2 and run both side by side. I haven't personally done it. But two folks out here says it works fine
2008-04-28T02:25:00.000Z	errpast	nhuyanhuk	ya, makes sense. I like the compiz effects. Is that the main attraction of compiz, the swish type effects, or is it more?
2008-04-28T02:25:00.000Z	errpast	nhuyanhuk	I really like those effects by the way
2008-04-28T02:26:00.000Z	errpast	nhuyanhuk	I'm not on that laptop right now. So I can't say. Though ff3 was fine on that laptop. And I was getting the effets
2008-04-28T02:27:00.000Z	errpast	nhuyanhuk	ah ha. I'm going to go dual head soon. Do you think I should avoid any monitors? or is it really just about the graphics card?
2008-04-28T02:27:00.000Z	errpast	nhuyanhuk	ah ha
2008-04-28T02:27:00.000Z	errpast	nhuyanhuk	I see
2008-04-28T02:27:00.000Z	errpast	nhuyanhuk	you mean for the card? sorry to be so dumb on video?
2008-04-28T02:28:00.000Z	errpast	nhuyanhuk	I'll stay clear of ATI
2008-04-28T02:28:00.000Z	errpast	nhuyanhuk	let me lspic and see what I've got in laptop
2008-04-28T02:28:00.000Z	errpast	nhuyanhuk	nv34m nvidia. Guess I got lucky
2008-04-28T02:29:00.000Z	errpast	nhuyanhuk	lspci will list the hardware components found by the kernel
2008-04-28T02:29:00.000Z	errpast	nhuyanhuk	yes. It can be really frustrating. I bought a laptop based on linux compat
2008-04-28T02:29:00.000Z	errpast	nhuyanhuk	I would find a model I liked, then I would google for "model +headaches"
2008-04-28T02:29:00.000Z	errpast	nhuyanhuk	I'm serious. It worked
2008-04-28T02:30:00.000Z	errpast	nhuyanhuk	anyway, gotta run. Need exercise :) good luck. See you out here soon! errpast
