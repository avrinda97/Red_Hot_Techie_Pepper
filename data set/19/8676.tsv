2007-03-10T11:57:00.000Z	kalorin		anyway, is there anyone here that's really good with X?
2007-03-10T11:57:00.000Z	kalorin		specifically Xorg?
2007-03-10T11:57:00.000Z	kalorin		heh
2007-03-10T11:58:00.000Z	kalorin		it's about trying to get the Xlib XFree86-DRI errors to go away
2007-03-10T11:58:00.000Z	kalorin		I don't have any real issues with this radeon card
2007-03-10T11:59:00.000Z	kalorin		I just can't seem to get the direct drawing stuff to work under xorg
2007-03-10T11:59:00.000Z	kalorin		and it's making me wonder if XFree is the better option?
2007-03-10T11:59:00.000Z	kalorin		Xinerama seems to kill direct draw
2007-03-10T11:59:00.000Z	kalorin		so I did it the ATI way and that didn't seem to help either
2007-03-10T12:00:00.000Z	kalorin		but it seems alittle snappier
2007-03-10T12:00:00.000Z	Rei-chan	kalorin	Did you get direct rendering enabled with your flgrx (ATI Binary) drivers?
2007-03-10T12:00:00.000Z	kalorin	Rei-chan	I think so
2007-03-10T12:00:00.000Z	kalorin	Rei-chan	how would I tell?
2007-03-10T12:00:00.000Z	Rei-chan	kalorin	If it didn't say Direct Rendering: Yes, then you didn't.
2007-03-10T12:01:00.000Z	Rei-chan	kalorin	In a terminal, use glxinfo.
2007-03-10T12:01:00.000Z	Rei-chan	kalorin	The ATI binary drivers section on the Ubuntu wiki describes installing and testing Radeon drivers, both open source and binary.
2007-03-10T12:01:00.000Z	kalorin	Rei-chan	any thoughts on how to change it's mind?
2007-03-10T12:24:00.000Z	Rei-chan	kalorin	Yes.
2007-03-10T12:24:00.000Z	Rei-chan	kalorin	Yes. Mine is "STUPID GRAPHICS CARD."
