2009-07-12T11:27:00.000Z	Skaperen	Jordan_U	unfortunately, making a dual-OS box increases the risk of those partition disasters
2010-12-15T06:57:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Skaperen	In what way is GNU tar not "full"?
2010-12-15T06:59:00.000Z	Skaperen	Jordan_U	the GNU version does not support sockets (it did in version 1.13 and earlier, but they removed that feature)
2010-12-15T07:01:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Skaperen	You can try bsdtar.
2010-12-15T07:02:00.000Z	Skaperen	Jordan_U	thanks ... I'll check into that one
2010-12-15T07:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Skaperen	You're welcome.
2010-12-15T07:07:00.000Z	Skaperen	Jordan_U	nope, bsdtar can't do sockets, either
2010-12-15T07:10:00.000Z	Skaperen	Jordan_U	I think the problem is they all switched to using libarchive and libarchive itself is the problem
2010-12-15T07:14:00.000Z	Skaperen	Jordan_U	I guess I'll have to use cpio for now, but cpio is such a pain
2011-05-15T07:56:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Skaperen	What is the output of "file ubuntu-11.04-server-amd64-00-installed.img"? (if it's more than one line please use pastebin).
2011-05-15T07:59:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Skaperen	That doesn't look like a cpio image at all...
2011-05-15T08:00:00.000Z	Skaperen	Jordan_U	the file I named is not a cpio image ... it's a vm image I'm trying to package up in cpio
2011-05-15T08:00:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Skaperen	Why are you trying to package up a single file with cpio?
2011-05-15T08:00:00.000Z	Skaperen	Jordan_U	I wasn't ... that's the first file it broke on
2011-05-15T08:01:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Skaperen	Ahh, OK.
2011-05-15T08:01:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Skaperen	What is your end goal? What features are you missing from GNU tar?
2011-05-15T08:15:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Skaperen	What error message are you getting with GNU tar?
2011-05-15T09:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Skaperen	What error message are you getting with GNU tar?
2011-05-15T09:02:00.000Z	Skaperen	Jordan_U	something about "pipe ignored"
