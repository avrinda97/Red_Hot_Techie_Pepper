2009-07-31T04:28:00.000Z	n33ds_h3lp		could anyone please tell me how to get to Networkmanager > VPN-Connections > Configure VPN
2009-07-31T04:29:00.000Z	cellofellow	n33ds_h3lp	right click the Network Manager applet, and click Edit Connections
2009-07-31T04:29:00.000Z	n33ds_h3lp	cellofellow	i don't see the configurevpn option
2009-07-31T04:30:00.000Z	cellofellow	n33ds_h3lp	there should be a VPN tab.
2009-07-31T04:32:00.000Z	cellofellow	n33ds_h3lp	you want to add a VPN connection. If the button is disabled, as mine appears to be, you probably need to install something.
2009-07-31T04:32:00.000Z	n33ds_h3lp	cellofellow	what would i need to install?
2009-07-31T04:32:00.000Z	cellofellow	n33ds_h3lp	not sure, let me check something
2009-07-31T04:33:00.000Z	cellofellow	n33ds_h3lp	what kind of VPN you trying to connect to?
2009-07-31T04:34:00.000Z	n33ds_h3lp	cellofellow	openvpn
2009-07-31T04:34:00.000Z	cellofellow	n33ds_h3lp	then install network-manager-openvpn
2009-07-31T04:35:00.000Z	cellofellow	n33ds_h3lp	there's also -pptp and -vpnc, for Microsoft and Cisco VPNs.
2009-07-31T04:35:00.000Z	n33ds_h3lp	cellofellow	 i have installed that before
2009-07-31T04:36:00.000Z	cellofellow	n33ds_h3lp	what was wrong?
2009-07-31T04:36:00.000Z	n33ds_h3lp	cellofellow	that's what im trying to find out now
2009-07-31T04:36:00.000Z	cellofellow	n33ds_h3lp	you might have to log out and back in for the installation to register.
2009-07-31T04:37:00.000Z	n33ds_h3lp	cellofellow	i restarted
2009-07-31T04:37:00.000Z	cellofellow	n33ds_h3lp	and it's still disabled in network manager?
2009-07-31T04:38:00.000Z	n33ds_h3lp	cellofellow	everything but "import". but its not that type of file.
2009-07-31T04:42:00.000Z	cellofellow	n33ds_h3lp	you're asking the wrong question. Maybe "how do I get NetworkManager working with OpenVPN?" would be better.
