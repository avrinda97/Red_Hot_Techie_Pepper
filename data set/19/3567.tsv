2009-07-30T19:10:00.000Z	Viliny		what keyword would you suggest in finding new themes in my synaptics manager? (gnome themes)
2009-07-30T19:12:00.000Z	Viliny		gtk+ themes? is that something FOR my gnome or INSTEAD of my gnome?
2009-07-30T19:13:00.000Z	Viliny		any quick way to check synaptics packages instead of right click and mark for installation?
2009-07-30T19:15:00.000Z	Viliny		:) - so... what about all these other... things that i have, their names escape me at the moment but it seems like theres a lot of different names floating out there when it comes to programs that alter my ubuntu visually. Compiz and so forth, i have little clue what works at which layer and which is actually an alternative to another and so forth
2009-07-30T19:17:00.000Z	Viliny		thank you edbian
2009-07-30T19:18:00.000Z	Viliny		so gnome and say... metacity work at the same level?
2009-07-30T19:19:00.000Z	Viliny		how would it all look without an "complete desktop environment" ?
2009-07-30T19:19:00.000Z	Viliny		so in short, some of the window managers are able to run on their own?
2009-07-30T19:20:00.000Z	Viliny		okay i see, but how does it then work to first have gnome and then go about choosing a window manager on top of that? sounds like something that would conflict?
2009-07-30T19:22:00.000Z	Viliny		so gnome comes with metacity as default?
2009-07-30T19:22:00.000Z	trashbarg	Viliny	yes
2009-07-30T19:22:00.000Z	Viliny		mine has compiz as well, is that instead of metacity?
2009-07-30T19:22:00.000Z	Viliny		or is that yet another addition to the pyramid?
2009-07-30T19:23:00.000Z	Viliny	im	pretty sure my ubuntu came with gnome and compiz out of the package
2009-07-30T19:23:00.000Z	trashbarg		BFevoly, this is not the point. You are telling him gnome is a window manager which is wrong.
2009-07-30T19:23:00.000Z	trashbarg	Viliny	You are right
2009-07-30T19:24:00.000Z	Viliny		so in short trashbarg, i would need to replace compiz with metacity if i wanted to switch to that
2009-07-30T19:24:00.000Z	trashbarg	Viliny	yes
2009-07-30T19:25:00.000Z	trashbarg	Viliny	Gnome is a collection of tools (like the control panel), a window manager (metacity) and some other applications(like the gnome panel)
