2007-06-14T07:48:00.000Z	stefg	lenzzzinoleonard	i dont have enough time to walk you through an install... so i can try to clarify if you need to understand certain terms, but i'm not going to solve the problem for you
2007-06-14T07:53:00.000Z	stefg	lenzzzinoleonard	it's described on that page. you need the windows driver CD, find the file containing the firmware and copy that over to your disk... the sequence of commands is written there, you just have to copy them (and maybe adjust the paths)
2007-06-14T07:56:00.000Z	lenzzzinoleonard	stefg	r u there?
