2005-09-16T10:54:00.000Z	Utopiate		Direct rendering: Yes
2005-09-16T10:54:00.000Z	Utopiate		The driver looks fine and everything works... it's just slower then on any other distro...
2005-09-16T10:54:00.000Z	Utopiate		gforce4 MX 4000 64meg pci
2005-09-16T10:55:00.000Z	Utopiate		ns 17 fps isn't good
2005-09-16T10:56:00.000Z	Utopiate		transgaming runs winex as a yearly service or 2 major versions
2005-09-16T10:57:00.000Z	Utopiate		yeah... you have one year subscription or two major version which ever first... or so I thought...
2005-09-16T10:57:00.000Z	Utopiate		heh
2005-09-16T10:57:00.000Z	Utopiate		linux native is the way to go and I support it because we need more games!
2005-09-16T10:58:00.000Z	Utopiate		transgaming has the right idea but it doesn't help us getting native games...
2005-09-16T10:58:00.000Z	Utopiate		The only games I ever played don't work in cedega
2005-09-16T10:59:00.000Z	gardenia	Utopiate	im not even sure they have the right idea given how many games dont work or dont work effectively
2005-09-16T11:00:00.000Z	gardenia	Utopiate	if your so into windows games why bother running linux at all
2005-09-16T11:00:00.000Z	gardenia	Utopiate	you do little to advance linux adoption this way
2005-09-16T11:01:00.000Z	Utopiate	gardenia	if you read up a bit I posted that native is the way to go but transgaming has the right idea creating an interest...
2005-09-16T11:01:00.000Z	gardenia	Utopiate	yeah I saw it
2005-09-16T11:01:00.000Z	gardenia	Utopiate	and I disagree completely
2005-09-16T11:03:00.000Z	gardenia	Utopiate	so support linuxgamepublishing then ;-)
2005-09-16T11:04:00.000Z	Utopiate	gardenia	I had no idea this place existed...
2005-09-16T11:32:00.000Z	gardenia	Utopiate	not sure rarely mess with it..you can always search in synaptic or use console with apt-cache search
