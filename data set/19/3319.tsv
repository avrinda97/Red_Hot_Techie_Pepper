2010-02-19T03:44:00.000Z	Scombr0		I have a question.
2010-02-19T03:44:00.000Z	Scombr0		How can I install PHP5 but with parameters?
2010-02-19T03:44:00.000Z	Scombr0		I was writing it =P
2010-02-19T03:44:00.000Z	Scombr0		I like being polite SpaceGhostC2C, you should try the same.
2010-02-19T03:45:00.000Z	Scombr0		I actually installed php5 with apt
2010-02-19T03:45:00.000Z	Scombr0		But I need to install it with parameters.
2010-02-19T03:45:00.000Z	Scombr0		./configure --enable-sockets --enable-pcntl --with-mysql
2010-02-19T03:45:00.000Z	Scombr0		I need those params.
2010-02-19T03:46:00.000Z	lime	Scombr0	You would have to recompile it yourself to add additional flags
2010-02-19T03:46:00.000Z	lime	Scombr0	But php on ubuntu is compiled with almost everything
2010-02-19T03:46:00.000Z	lime	Scombr0	If it√¶s not in the php5 package, they are in some other php-[something]
2010-02-19T03:47:00.000Z	lime	Scombr0	Check the docs installed with php
2010-02-19T03:48:00.000Z	lime	Scombr0	if you need to check for what capabilities are enabled by php installation, do a phpinfo(); in your phpfile
2010-02-19T03:49:00.000Z	lime	Scombr0	Hmm, let me check what pcntl does
2010-02-19T03:49:00.000Z	Scombr0	lime	tbh I have no idea what 'pcntl' is, but I need it in order to make this run properly.
2010-02-19T03:50:00.000Z	lime	Scombr0	You will need to recompile PHP with process control support
2010-02-19T03:50:00.000Z	Scombr0	lime	i used the apt to get PHP5.
2010-02-19T03:58:00.000Z	lime	Scombr0	Well, it seems that the module you want is not available by default. . .
2010-02-19T03:59:00.000Z	Scombr0	lime	Alright, so apt-get source php5 and do it manually right?
