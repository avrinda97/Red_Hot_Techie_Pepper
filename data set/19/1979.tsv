2010-08-10T18:07:00.000Z	happydonut		hi, in ubuntu server 10.04, why can't i: sudo apt-get install mysql; stop mysql;
2010-08-10T18:08:00.000Z	happydonut		1) dbus isn't installed, why?
2010-08-10T18:08:00.000Z	happydonut		2) when I install dbus, I get the error about sending message, why?
2010-08-10T18:08:00.000Z	happydonut		but mostly, why can't I: sudo apt-get install mysql; stop mysql in an out of the box ubuntu 10.04 LTS server?
2010-08-10T18:08:00.000Z	happydonut		you can in 9.10
2010-08-10T18:08:00.000Z	joschi	happydonut	stop is no command. try service mysql stop or /etc/init.d/mysql stop
2010-08-10T18:09:00.000Z	happydonut	joschi	take that as read
2010-08-10T18:09:00.000Z	happydonut	joschi	question 1) why isn't dbus installed on mysql server, 2) why isn't dbus a dependency of mysql (a little know / little used package?)
2010-08-10T18:10:00.000Z	joschi	happydonut	why should mysql need dbus?
2010-08-10T18:10:00.000Z	joschi	happydonut	anyway, you can install dbus yourself anytime
2010-08-10T18:11:00.000Z	happydonut	joschi	service mysql restart (cannot connecto system bus), so are you asking, why does mysql need "service mysql restart"?
2010-08-10T18:13:00.000Z	joschi	happydonut	how have you installed ubuntu?
2010-08-10T18:13:00.000Z	joschi	happydonut	livecd, alternative cd, pxeboot, ...
2010-08-10T18:14:00.000Z	happydonut	joschi	ubuntu server 10.03
2010-08-10T18:15:00.000Z	joschi	happydonut	yes, but how have you installed it? because dbus will get installed with a standard installation from an official livecd
2010-08-10T18:16:00.000Z	happydonut	joschi	which live cd do you mean? I mean ubuntu-server from the ubuntu website. You don't mean desktop do you?
2010-08-10T18:17:00.000Z	joschi	happydonut	you have downloaded the ubuntu server livecd from the website and installed ubuntu server on your system using it?
2010-08-10T18:17:00.000Z	happydonut	joschi	the server co did that
2010-08-10T18:17:00.000Z	joschi	happydonut	please do a fresh install using the official installation cd
