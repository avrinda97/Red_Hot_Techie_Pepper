2008-04-14T18:57:00.000Z	alx54		hi everyone.. "according to mtab this drive is already mounted" but i still cannot access my data, anyone know why this happens?
2008-04-14T18:57:00.000Z	jrib	alx54	what filesystem?
2008-04-14T18:58:00.000Z	alx54	jrib	should i pastebin something?
2008-04-14T18:58:00.000Z	jrib	alx54	where is it mounted?  what permissions are on the mount point?
2008-04-14T18:59:00.000Z	alx54	jrib	it is mounted in /media/Drivename and i just set chmod 777 on it
2008-04-14T18:59:00.000Z	jrib	alx54	what is the output of 'ls -ld /media/Drivename'?
2008-04-14T19:03:00.000Z	alx54	jrib	i can cd to the path /media/Eigenschaften no error message
2008-04-14T19:03:00.000Z	jrib	alx54	k, so what doesn't work exactly?
2008-04-14T19:05:00.000Z	jrib	alx54	notice that the 777 permissions apply only to /media/Eigenschaften, not the stuff under it
2008-04-14T19:06:00.000Z	alx54	jrib	wasnt thers something like chmod 777 * or so to apply it to subfolders?
2008-04-14T19:06:00.000Z	jrib	alx54	are you sure that is what you want?
2008-04-14T19:06:00.000Z	alx54	jrib	yes, im the only user of this pc
2008-04-14T19:07:00.000Z	jrib	alx54	sudo chmod -R 777 /media/Eigenschaften   (if you apply this to the wrong place, your install will be broken)
2008-04-14T19:08:00.000Z	alx54	jrib	its a storage drive, should be safe to do that right?
2008-04-14T19:08:00.000Z	jrib	alx54	yes
2008-04-14T19:11:00.000Z	alx54	jrib	just another question if u dont mind... since this is an internal drive, i want it to mount on startup, but that didnt work with this line in fstab "/dev/hdb1  /media/Eigenschaften  ext3  rw,defaults,umask=0000  0  2"
2008-04-14T19:12:00.000Z	alx54	jrib	and when i replaced /dev.. with the UUID it also didnt work
2008-04-14T19:12:00.000Z	jrib	alx54	ext3 does not use the umask option
2008-04-14T19:12:00.000Z	jrib	alx54	"defaults" should work fine
