2009-03-17T08:17:00.000Z	Bearcat		hey folks, i'm losing my mind. I'm trying to get a pixmap gtk2 theme working and i can't get any apps to use it. I've coped the theme to /usr/share/themes and the gtkrc file to ~/  What else would i have to do. (note, i'm not using gnome, i just want some matching gtk apps in kde)
2009-03-17T08:18:00.000Z	crdlb	Bearcat	that's not how you do it
2009-03-17T08:18:00.000Z	Bearcat	crdlb	oh? Teach me oh wise one :")
2009-03-17T08:18:00.000Z	crdlb	Bearcat	first of all, I believe kde has support for setting the gtk theme
2009-03-17T08:19:00.000Z	crdlb	Bearcat	if it doesn't, you can use switch2 from the gtk-theme-switch package, which writes gtk-theme-name to ~/.gtkrc-2.0
2009-03-17T08:19:00.000Z	Bearcat	crdlb	well the idea is that soon i will be using neither kde or gnome.
2009-03-17T08:19:00.000Z	Bearcat	crdlb	ahh
2009-03-17T08:19:00.000Z	crdlb		also, you can put themes in ~/.themes/ instead of doing it systemwide
2009-03-17T08:20:00.000Z	Bearcat	crdlb	right, but i'd rather it were system wide
2009-03-17T08:20:00.000Z	Bearcat	crdlb	thanks. I'll try that
2009-03-17T08:26:00.000Z	Bearcat	crdlb	what would the manual option be? i dont have gtk-theme-switch avail.
2009-03-17T08:26:00.000Z	crdlb	Bearcat	you don't have a gtk-theme-switch package in the repos?
2009-03-17T08:27:00.000Z	Bearcat	crdlb	i'm not a ubuntu user, i'm using sourcemage
2009-03-17T08:28:00.000Z	crdlb	Bearcat	don't they have a channel? :/
2009-03-17T08:28:00.000Z	Bearcat	crdlb	they do but...
2009-03-17T08:28:00.000Z	Bearcat	crdlb	finally someone who uses gtk stuff :")
2009-03-17T08:28:00.000Z	Bearcat	crdlb	i think i just figured it out
2009-03-17T08:28:00.000Z	crdlb	Bearcat	#gtk+ on irc.gnome.org
2009-03-17T08:29:00.000Z	Bearcat	crdlb	thanks. I'll check there next. I appreciate the help
