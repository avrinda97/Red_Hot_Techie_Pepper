2012-09-19T09:53:00.000Z	gypsy_blood		hello, i am trying to get a game to work, and it specifies a range of network ports i need to choose from, when i list the ports in terminal, no ports are there in that range...anyone know how to create a new port? or any other way around this issue?
2012-09-19T09:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gypsy_blood	is it a game server or a game itself?
2012-09-19T09:55:00.000Z	gypsy_blood	ActionParsnip	its an mmorpg...Final Fantasy XIV, so i believe game server
2012-09-19T09:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gypsy_blood	did you check the appdb?
2012-09-19T09:56:00.000Z	gypsy_blood	ActionParsnip	appdb? whats that?
2012-09-19T09:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gypsy_blood	why not find out
2012-09-19T09:58:00.000Z	gypsy_blood	ActionParsnip	im complete noob with linux...i dont even know what appdb is, muchless how to find...can you give a lil more info plz
2012-09-19T09:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gypsy_blood	use web searches. Even the simplest search will find it. I promise
2012-09-19T09:59:00.000Z	gypsy_blood	ActionParsnip	kk
2012-09-19T09:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gypsy_blood	try using a little initiative, it really goes far
2012-09-19T09:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gypsy_blood	even if you literally search for just: appdb  you find what you need.
2012-09-19T09:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gypsy_blood	being new to linux is so over used. I am VERY sure you are not new to using the web to find out new stuff, are you?
2012-09-19T10:00:00.000Z	gypsy_blood	ActionParsnip	lol, ive been trying to work on this for the past 8 hours...learned ALOT in that time as far as how to use terminal to get stuff done...still dont know too much tho
2012-09-19T10:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gypsy_blood	but you are good at finding new stuff out online....yes?
2012-09-19T10:00:00.000Z	gypsy_blood	ActionParsnip	you are correct in that...just half asleep and not thinking completely straight atm lol, yeah im searching it now
2012-09-19T10:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gypsy_blood	so how is this any different?
2012-09-19T10:01:00.000Z	gypsy_blood	ActionParsnip	oh ok, appdb as in wine correct?
2012-09-19T10:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gypsy_blood	yes as you are running a windows app
2012-09-19T10:02:00.000Z	gypsy_blood	ActionParsnip	ok...well, yeah i have wine...i have the game fully installed...the question wasnt about how to install, was about how to set up a port
