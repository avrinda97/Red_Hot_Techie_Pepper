2008-02-25T22:13:00.000Z	Falgor_		how do I destroy ubuntu from my HD?
2008-02-25T22:13:00.000Z	Falgor_		I seem to be unable to install windows 2000.
2008-02-25T22:14:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Falgor_	Install anything you want right over the top
2008-02-25T22:14:00.000Z	Falgor_	Jack_Sparrow	I dont know but for some reason windows 2000 wont install
2008-02-25T22:15:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Falgor_	If you are booting the win2000 cd then it has nothing to do with ubuntu and you should ask in #Windows
2008-02-25T22:16:00.000Z	Falgor_	Jack_Sparrow	I was just thinking it was somehow linux related that it was unable to install.
2008-02-25T22:16:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Falgor_	Cant be the problem
2008-02-25T22:18:00.000Z	Falgor_	Jack_Sparrow	I was first asking how I can remove Ubuntu
2008-02-25T22:20:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Falgor_	And I told you..
2008-02-25T22:21:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Falgor_	Ask in windows, there is no magic hold that Ubuntu has on your hard drive
2008-02-25T22:22:00.000Z	Falgor_	Jack_Sparrow	is there some kinda command line for ubuntu that lets me format the drive (like just after boot)?
2008-02-25T22:22:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Falgor_	gparted livecd which you were also already told would work
2008-02-25T22:22:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Falgor_	the ubuntu livecd with gparted will also work..
2008-02-25T22:23:00.000Z	Falgor_	Jack_Sparrow	yes. I was just asking if it was possible without another livecd.... I dont know if I have gparted on this cd.
2008-02-25T22:23:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Falgor_	You NEED to go ask for support in the channel that supports the OS you want to install.. this is NOT the place
2008-02-25T22:24:00.000Z	Falgor_	Jack_Sparrow	I havent mentioned windows in my last few sentences.
2008-02-25T22:24:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Falgor_	Doesnt matter what you mention...  you want to remove ubuntu.. fine.. install anything you want over the top of it..  You are bordering on troll.. please stop
2008-02-25T22:25:00.000Z	Falgor_	Jack_Sparrow	I wouldnt WANT to remove ubuntu.
2008-02-25T22:26:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Falgor_	Then dual boot
