2007-02-20T13:55:00.000Z	Subhuman		you cant install dpkg
2007-02-20T13:55:00.000Z	Subhuman		since apt-get uses dpkg.....
2007-02-20T13:56:00.000Z	Subhuman		so how can you use dpkg to install itself?
2007-02-20T13:56:00.000Z	dhorn	Subhuman	any suggestions?
2007-02-20T13:56:00.000Z	dhorn	Subhuman	so I'm basically going to have to reinstall ubuntu?
2007-02-20T13:56:00.000Z	Subhuman	dhorn	nah theyll be a way to sort it.
2007-02-20T13:57:00.000Z	dhorn	Subhuman	thanks
2007-02-20T13:58:00.000Z	Subhuman	dhorn	if you type "dpkg" do you get some text?
2007-02-20T13:58:00.000Z	dhorn	Subhuman	it says that the command is notn found
2007-02-20T13:59:00.000Z	dhorn	Subhuman	it was removed from /usr/bin so yeah...
2007-02-20T13:59:00.000Z	dhorn	Subhuman	my stupidity
2007-02-20T13:59:00.000Z	dhorn	Subhuman	removed the wrong file "rm dpkg"....
2007-02-20T14:00:00.000Z	Subhuman	dhorn	hmm - well you could compile your own dpkg, and then use that to install dpkg from packages.ubuntu.com....
2007-02-20T14:00:00.000Z	dhorn	Subhuman	is that a bitch to do?
2007-02-20T14:01:00.000Z	Subhuman	dhorn	ledbettj 's idea might be better - grab the dpkg.deb and open it yourself
2007-02-20T14:02:00.000Z	Subhuman	dhorn	the executable, yes.
2007-02-20T14:02:00.000Z	dhorn	Subhuman	should that fix my issues?
2007-02-20T14:02:00.000Z	Subhuman	dhorn	yep.
2007-02-20T14:04:00.000Z	dhorn	Subhuman	one last question, am I going to have to change any permissions?  or should i?
