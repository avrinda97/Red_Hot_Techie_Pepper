2012-04-19T18:41:00.000Z	meganerd	StevenCodes	do you want to zip it?
2012-04-19T18:42:00.000Z	meganerd	StevenCodes	I use 7zip on Windows and Ubuntu as it pretty much can uncompress anything
2012-04-19T18:43:00.000Z	StevenCodes	meganerd	 Thing is this ain't my server and I don't have SSH just FTP and trying to unzip my site but net2ftp said it was too big to unzip so im thinking thats in php.ini is there another way i can trasnfer
2012-04-19T18:43:00.000Z	meganerd	StevenCodes	so you have a tar.bz that you want to unzip?
2012-04-19T18:43:00.000Z	StevenCodes	meganerd	 nah but its reg zip but I can make it tar.bz
2012-04-19T18:44:00.000Z	meganerd	StevenCodes	it doesn't matter, where is this zip file (remote or local to your machine
2012-04-19T18:46:00.000Z	StevenCodes	meganerd	 Desktop
2012-04-19T18:47:00.000Z	meganerd	StevenCodes	on windows I use winscp to download, and 7zip to uncompress
2012-04-19T18:47:00.000Z	StevenCodes	meganerd	 I'm trying to uncompress it onto the server though
2012-04-19T18:48:00.000Z	meganerd	StevenCodes	and you do not have shell access?
2012-04-19T18:48:00.000Z	meganerd	StevenCodes	so no ssh or telnet?
2012-04-19T18:48:00.000Z	StevenCodes	meganerd	 Nopes
2012-04-19T18:48:00.000Z	meganerd	StevenCodes	so that is kind of your problem right there
2012-04-19T18:48:00.000Z	StevenCodes	meganerd	 I'm coincidently migrating to new host
2012-04-19T18:50:00.000Z	meganerd	StevenCodes	I didn't think that ftp supports that sort of transaction, I could be wrong as I have not used ftp in close to a decade.  The webhost I use allows ssh and sftp/scp
2012-04-19T18:50:00.000Z	StevenCodes	meganerd	 Yeah too young to pay gonna use 000webhost till I can get a paid one
