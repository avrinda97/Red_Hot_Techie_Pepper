2010-12-15T21:39:00.000Z	Jemt	bonjoyee	Thank you, I know. Remastering the Live CD is what I want though.
2010-12-16T21:56:00.000Z	bonjoyee	Jemt	check the application name in the launcher..
2010-12-16T21:57:00.000Z	Jemt	bonjoyee	Thanks, but this is an applet in the panel. But perhaps I can access some properties of sort
2010-12-16T21:58:00.000Z	bonjoyee	Jemt	what applet is it?
2010-12-16T21:59:00.000Z	Jemt	bonjoyee	Broadcast Accounts in Indicator
2010-12-16T22:00:00.000Z	Jemt	bonjoyee	I figured it out. 'xprop' can provide me the information I need
2010-12-16T22:00:00.000Z	Jemt	bonjoyee	It was already running. But thank you for your suggestion :)
2011-01-10T22:05:00.000Z	bonjoyee	Jemt	right click > preferences?
2011-01-10T22:06:00.000Z	Jemt	bonjoyee	I need to be able to change it using gconf. Then I can change it using the XML files underneath gconf

2011-01-10T22:07:00.000Z	Jemt	bonjoyee	Tried that, doesn't work. I still got 4 desktops after changing the value to 1
2011-01-10T22:07:00.000Z	Jemt	bonjoyee	I even restarted X
2011-01-10T22:07:00.000Z	bonjoyee	Jemt	might be restoring it..
2011-01-10T22:08:00.000Z	Jemt	bonjoyee	Possibly :-/
2011-01-10T22:09:00.000Z	bonjoyee	Jemt	try doing it with gconf-tool..read somewhere it is recommended!
2011-01-10T22:10:00.000Z	Jemt	bonjoyee	Do you know what package contains gconf-tool ? I don't have it installed
2011-01-10T22:12:00.000Z	bonjoyee	Jemt	its gconftool
