2011-04-27T19:09:00.000Z	LAcan	PhYoshi	there should be a safe mode in your grub2 loader?
2011-04-27T19:09:00.000Z	LAcan	PhYoshi	like the second option
2011-04-27T19:10:00.000Z	PhYoshi	LAcan	I'm trying to get the installer to run at all, unfortunately - no grub2 here
2011-04-27T19:10:00.000Z	LAcan	PhYoshi	is it a sony?
2011-04-27T19:11:00.000Z	PhYoshi	LAcan	samsung
2011-04-27T19:11:00.000Z	LAcan	PhYoshi	are you able to boot from the live CD?
2011-04-27T19:11:00.000Z	PhYoshi	LAcan	nope, but whether that's due to insufficient RAM or a more serious issue I don't know
2011-04-27T19:12:00.000Z	PhYoshi	LAcan	it lets me try, but everything spends more time crashing and restarting than doing anything of use
2011-04-27T19:12:00.000Z	LAcan	PhYoshi	what is the hardare? like how much ram and drive space?
2011-04-27T19:13:00.000Z	PhYoshi	LAcan	256mb RAM, not a clue about drive space but shouldn't be an issue for a live system, and a 2GHz celeron
2011-04-27T19:14:00.000Z	LAcan	PhYoshi	i suggest lubuntu
2011-04-27T19:15:00.000Z	PhYoshi	LAcan	Is that likely to work given that the /installer/ crashes? Will it not use the same basic structure up until there?
2011-04-27T19:15:00.000Z	LAcan	PhYoshi	try it, its a 640MB download, shouldnt take very long
2011-04-27T19:15:00.000Z	LAcan	PhYoshi	lubuntu is amazing on old hardware
2011-04-27T19:16:00.000Z	PhYoshi	LAcan	Well, I'm a hair off my bandwidth cap this month, so unfortunately doing it just to check is a bit much :P
2011-04-27T19:17:00.000Z	LAcan	PhYoshi	look ubuntu is not gonna perform well on that setup. lubuntu is gonna fly, i promise
2011-04-27T19:17:00.000Z	PhYoshi	LAcan	I've accepted that, and am totally willing to run it entirely from a terminal if I have to :P
2011-04-27T19:18:00.000Z	LAcan	PhYoshi	ok then, for the recod lubuntu also has a terminal :)
2011-04-27T19:18:00.000Z	PhYoshi	LAcan	I'll absolutely consider it come 1st may, I promise ;)
