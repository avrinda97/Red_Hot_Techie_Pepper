2009-07-12T05:25:00.000Z	OttifantSir	Ramonster	A little, what's the problem?
2009-07-12T05:26:00.000Z	Ramonster	OttifantSir	I got samba installed now. But if I get into the samba folder from my XP Machine and put some files/folders in it, I cant get to them on the ubuntu machine
2009-07-12T05:27:00.000Z	OttifantSir	Ramonster	On which machine is the samba-folder? The Ubuntu? Or the XP?
2009-07-12T05:27:00.000Z	Ramonster	OttifantSir	On the Ubuntu machine
2009-07-12T05:27:00.000Z	OttifantSir	Ramonster	Where is it placed?
2009-07-12T05:29:00.000Z	OttifantSir	Ramonster	The files too?
2009-07-12T05:29:00.000Z	Ramonster	OttifantSir	Just need to chmod the folder right? Dont need to chmod every file?
2009-07-12T05:31:00.000Z	OttifantSir	Ramonster	Check the permissions on one of the files. I believe the command for changing the permissions on folder and files within them are chmod -R uga+rwx/777 /dir/to/
2009-07-12T05:42:00.000Z	OttifantSir	Ramonster	I like to use ugoa+rwx instead of 777 as I can never remember the values, so in your case, the command would be: sudo chmod -R u+rwx /srv/samba. If you don't know what that means, ask me, and I'll explain.
2009-07-12T05:42:00.000Z	Ramonster	OttifantSir	What does that mean? :P
2009-07-12T05:44:00.000Z	OttifantSir	Ramonster	-R = recursive, includes all files and sub-folders and files in sub-folders. u = user, you +rwx = Read,Write,eXecute. And of course the folder you wish to perform the operation on.
2009-07-12T05:47:00.000Z	Ramonster	OttifantSir	Thanks for explaining.
2009-07-12T05:48:00.000Z	OttifantSir	Ramonster	No Prob. I just wish I had thought of IRC the first day I switched from Windows to Linux. I'd be so much farter ahead than I am now... :-(
