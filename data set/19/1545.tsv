2011-04-02T06:12:00.000Z	azizLIGHTS		what do you mean rww ?
2011-04-02T06:12:00.000Z	rww	azizLIGHTS	You didn't say what protocol you're talking about. I assume it's ssh?
2011-04-02T06:12:00.000Z	rww	azizLIGHTS	over ssh?
2011-04-02T06:12:00.000Z	rww	azizLIGHTS	modify ~/.ssh/known_hosts
2011-04-02T06:16:00.000Z	rww	azizLIGHTS	you changed something with the public key files on either the client or the ~/ of the user you're sshing to.
2011-04-02T06:17:00.000Z	azizLIGHTS	rww	ok how do i fix it now
2011-04-02T06:17:00.000Z	rww	azizLIGHTS	depends, what did you change?
2011-04-02T06:18:00.000Z	rww	azizLIGHTS	allow password-based connections, then ssh-copy-id user@hostname on the client.
2011-04-02T06:18:00.000Z	azizLIGHTS	rww	i am not sure, really
2011-04-02T06:18:00.000Z	azizLIGHTS	rww	oh yes.. i have pssword login disabled on sshd
2011-04-02T06:18:00.000Z	rww	azizLIGHTS	although I don't do EC2, so that may or may not work for you.
2011-04-02T06:19:00.000Z	azizLIGHTS	rww	when you say do ssh-copy-id user@host on the client, which pc do i run that from? ec2 or the comptuer who wants to connect to ec2
2011-04-02T06:20:00.000Z	rww	azizLIGHTS	the user who wants to connect to ec2
2011-04-02T06:20:00.000Z	rww	azizLIGHTS	hence me saying "client"
2011-04-02T06:25:00.000Z	rww	azizLIGHTS	sudo service ssh restart
2011-04-02T06:26:00.000Z	rww	azizLIGHTS	it still works, generally
2011-04-02T06:31:00.000Z	rww	azizLIGHTS	no. PasswordAuthentication No is
