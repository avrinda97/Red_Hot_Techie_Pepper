2007-11-30T07:05:00.000Z	allenc		I am getting soundcard errors.  How do I reinstall the soundcard drivers?
2007-11-30T07:06:00.000Z	DaveQB	allenc	you cant if they are built into the kernel
2007-11-30T07:06:00.000Z	DaveQB	allenc	 might be a module and you can re-compile that, but why ?
2007-11-30T07:09:00.000Z	DaveQB	allenc	 what type ?
2007-11-30T07:09:00.000Z	DaveQB	allenc	 card supported by the Linux kernel ?
2007-11-30T07:10:00.000Z	allenc	DaveQB	just says there was a problem with soundcard, doesn't list specifics... I don't know if it supported or not.
2007-11-30T07:12:00.000Z	DaveQB	allenc	 try alsaconf too
2007-11-30T07:22:00.000Z	allenc	DaveQB	any ideas for me?
2007-11-30T07:38:00.000Z	DaveQB	allenc	 did you run alsaconf to reconfigure sound card ?
2007-11-30T07:38:00.000Z	DaveQB	allenc	 sounds liek cardm ight not be supported, buy a new card for $10 !!
2007-11-30T07:38:00.000Z	DaveQB	allenc	 run it from a virtual terminal
2007-11-30T07:38:00.000Z	DaveQB	allenc	 know how to do that ?
2007-11-30T07:38:00.000Z	DaveQB	allenc	 oh ?
2007-11-30T07:38:00.000Z	DaveQB	allenc	 thats odd
2007-11-30T07:39:00.000Z	allenc	DaveQB	sudo alsaconf says command not found
2007-11-30T07:42:00.000Z	allenc	DaveQB	How do I run that, it says command not found.
2007-11-30T07:43:00.000Z	DaveQB	allenc	 alsaconf ? yeah it seems to be gone now a days, I used to use it heaps over the years
2007-11-30T07:43:00.000Z	DaveQB	allenc	 there must be something comparable to it now a days
2007-11-30T07:43:00.000Z	DaveQB	allenc	 google alsaconf ubuntu
