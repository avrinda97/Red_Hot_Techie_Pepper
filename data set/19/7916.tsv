2010-11-08T08:56:00.000Z	brverg		I need help on manual partitioning
2010-11-08T08:57:00.000Z	brverg		how much space is necessary for swap area?
2010-11-08T08:58:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	brverg	most use around 2GB but some suggest equal to your RAM.
2010-11-08T08:59:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	brverg	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SwapFaq    read that to understand what swap is
2010-11-08T09:04:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	brverg	you'll need a / with no less than 10GB if you will do a seperate /home (i use 15GB) and a /swap around 2GB or equal to your RAM, and if you wish a /home being as large as you want which this is where your files and configurations will be
2010-11-08T09:04:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	brverg	yes, perfect
2010-11-08T09:06:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	brverg	what is the error you get? there has to be an error during boot or when gnome loads
2010-11-08T09:06:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	brverg	Home Folder is not listed in Places?
2010-11-08T09:08:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	brverg	pastebin the contents of /etc/fstab and the output of mount
2010-11-08T09:11:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	brverg	/home can be ext4 yes, can you pastebin the output of the command mount?
2010-11-08T09:12:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	brverg	in a terminal type mount   ..copy paste that to the paste.ubuntu.com website and give the link here
2010-11-08T09:21:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	brverg	that is not what i asked you to pastebin. type mount  and pastebin the output
2010-11-08T09:29:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	brverg	from what i see the commit=0 may be the issue, is there a reason you have this option?
2010-11-08T09:30:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	brverg	this is a confirmed bug, https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/pm-utils/+bug/610055
2010-11-08T09:40:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	brverg	would taking the commit=0 out of fstab be an issue for you?
2010-11-08T09:42:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	brverg	pastebin /etc/fstab .. in a terminal type cat /etc/fstab then copy paste that.
2010-11-08T09:49:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	brverg	i don't know what else to do since it is a known bug with no fix as of yet.
2010-11-08T09:51:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	brverg	not that i can find.
2010-11-08T09:53:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	brverg	best of luck
