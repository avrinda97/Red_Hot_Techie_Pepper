2004-11-22T13:49:00.000Z	JDahl	matson	just ask your question... otherwise how do we know if we can help?
2004-11-22T13:53:00.000Z	matson		i made this: apt-get install ntp -> ok then i tried to start ntpd but it dosent work
2004-11-22T13:56:00.000Z	JDahl	matson	do you get any error messsages when you start ntpd? (and are you running Warty?)
2004-11-22T13:56:00.000Z	matson		bash: ntpd: command not found
2004-11-22T13:57:00.000Z	JDahl	matson	I think you need to install ntpserver also... (you probably used apt-get and didnt install recommended packages, right?)
2004-11-22T13:58:00.000Z	matson		yes warty...what is the name of that package?
2004-11-22T14:00:00.000Z	matson	JDahl	i did not find ntpd or similar package...
2004-11-22T14:00:00.000Z	JDahl	matson	I dont think you're supposed to run ntpd yourself... try "sudo /etc/init.d/ntpdate restart"
2004-11-22T14:01:00.000Z	JDahl	matson	I was probably wrong - but I remember installing ntp + ntpserver on debian
2004-11-22T14:02:00.000Z	JDahl	matson	then do "ps -ef | grep ntpd" to see if it is running
2004-11-22T14:03:00.000Z	matson	JDahl	this:
2004-11-22T14:04:00.000Z	matson		oops..root@ubuntu:/home/mika # ps -ef | grep ntpd
2004-11-22T14:04:00.000Z	matson		root     23380 17071  0 10:03 pts/4    00:00:00 grep ntpd
2004-11-22T14:06:00.000Z	JDahl	matson	then I am out of ideas - you installed ntp and ntpdate?
2004-11-22T14:07:00.000Z	matson	JDahl	yes..i hawe done this many times in mdk and debian...
2004-11-22T14:08:00.000Z	matson	JDahl	does it work in your computer?
2004-11-22T14:08:00.000Z	matson		with ubuntu
2004-11-22T14:09:00.000Z	JDahl	matson	yes, from the basic installation
2004-11-22T14:10:00.000Z	matson	JDahl	strange...ok thanks...i have to take maybe base-config again..
