2010-09-04T19:43:00.000Z	fladd	jrib	that does not work for sh scripts, only for installed programmes!
2010-09-04T19:43:00.000Z	jrib	fladd	works fine for sh scripts
2010-09-04T19:43:00.000Z	jrib	fladd	how are you trying to start them?
2010-09-04T19:44:00.000Z	jrib	fladd	just give the full path and make sure it's executable
2010-09-04T19:44:00.000Z	jrib	fladd	that will work
2010-09-04T19:44:00.000Z	fladd	jrib	well, not here, that is why I am askin (ubuntu lucid netbook remix)
2010-09-04T19:45:00.000Z	jrib	fladd	pastebin the script?  Have you troubleshooted?  Try just making it touch a file that doesn't exist
2010-09-04T19:45:00.000Z	fladd	jrib	wait, i pastebin it...
2010-09-04T19:45:00.000Z	jrib	fladd	FASTER
2010-09-04T19:45:00.000Z	jrib	fladd	j/k
2010-09-04T19:46:00.000Z	fladd	jrib	the script works fine btw when I start it from a shell after login
2010-09-04T19:47:00.000Z	jrib	fladd	how do you execute in the shell exactly?
2010-09-04T19:48:00.000Z	jrib	fladd	but that's not what you put in autostart :)
2010-09-04T19:49:00.000Z	jrib	fladd	almost certainly the issue is your script runs and then gnome overwrites your settings
2010-09-04T19:49:00.000Z	jrib	fladd	add "touch ~/im_totally_getting_executed" before the "exit" line and make sure that file gets created
2010-09-04T19:50:00.000Z	fladd	jrib	I will try that
2010-09-04T19:56:00.000Z	fladd	jrib	you were right, it is getting sourced, but gnome does seem to overwrite stuff. that is weird, one would assume that gnome sources the autostart stuff in the beginning of the login process...
2010-09-04T19:56:00.000Z	fladd	jrib	so, what can I do about this? any idea?
