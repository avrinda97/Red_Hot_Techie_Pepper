2009-05-12T12:59:00.000Z	matt_		I am having problems with mounting usb drives... When I insert the drive, I receive a "Cannot mount volume" message. Clicking on the more info option, I get told: mount: /dev/sdb1: cannot read superblock.
2009-05-12T13:00:00.000Z	SirErugor	matt_	try fsck'ing it
2009-05-12T13:01:00.000Z	SirErugor	matt_	what fs is running on it+
2009-05-12T13:01:00.000Z	SirErugor	matt_	man fsck.vfat
2009-05-12T13:09:00.000Z	SirErugor	matt_	it should be there since it's in the base system
2009-05-12T13:13:00.000Z	matt_	SirErugor	just ran it again. Seems I typed sbd instead of sdb. Lol. It just outputs saying "Contains a free cluster. Assuming EOF. FAT32 root dir starts with a bad cluster"
2009-05-12T13:15:00.000Z	SirErugor	matt_	hehe.. ;) now you fsck.vfat -t -y -a then path to dev
2009-05-12T13:15:00.000Z	matt_	SirErugor	identical output
2009-05-12T13:16:00.000Z	SirErugor	matt_	oh and remember the -w option
2009-05-12T13:16:00.000Z	matt_	SirErugor	same output again
2009-05-12T13:17:00.000Z	SirErugor	matt_	weird.. but it should have corrected something
2009-05-12T13:18:00.000Z	SirErugor	matt_	try the -V for verification pass too
2009-05-12T13:18:00.000Z	matt_	SirErugor	did that... And guess what? Same output. Lol
2009-05-12T13:19:00.000Z	SirErugor	matt_	haha.. weird, for sure :S
2009-05-12T13:19:00.000Z	matt_	SirErugor	yeah, definitely. Is there a way to force it to mount and then format it?
2009-05-12T13:20:00.000Z	SirErugor	matt_	you format before mounting it
2009-05-12T13:20:00.000Z	SirErugor	matt_	mkfs.vfat
2009-05-12T13:24:00.000Z	matt_	SirErugor	that fixed the problem. Thank you. ^_^
2009-05-12T13:24:00.000Z	SirErugor	matt_	np :)
