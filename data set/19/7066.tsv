2007-10-18T03:29:00.000Z	scooby2		gutsy is not even close to being ready for release
2007-10-18T03:30:00.000Z	lamego	scooby2	do you have a question ?
2007-10-18T03:30:00.000Z	scooby2		yeah, why did bacula blow away my config files when i upgraded from feisty to gutsy?
2007-10-18T03:32:00.000Z	lamego	scooby2	because upgrades are complex processes, you can easly reset your config files, do you know how to do it, also this is about support questions, not about bug reports, use launchpad for that
2007-10-18T03:32:00.000Z	scooby2	lamego	i'd give loads of dollars to get my old config files and my old /var/spool/bacula directory back
2007-10-18T03:33:00.000Z	lamego	scooby2	people which gives loads of dollars for some data, performs backups
2007-10-18T03:34:00.000Z	lamego		specially, before an upgrade
2007-10-18T03:34:00.000Z	scooby2		i do perform backups
2007-10-18T03:34:00.000Z	scooby2		asshats overwrite config files
2007-10-18T03:34:00.000Z	lamego	scooby2	so just restore the data from your backups, if you are unable to use it, create a bug report at launchpad.net
2007-10-18T03:35:00.000Z	scooby2		i have a backup of my backup software
2007-10-18T03:35:00.000Z	scooby2		its just going to take me hours to rewrite the configs to get them back
2007-10-18T03:35:00.000Z	scooby2		cause some asshat packagerr doesnt have a brain
2007-10-18T03:35:00.000Z	lamego	scooby2	and what help do you expect get from us on such task ?
2007-10-18T03:35:00.000Z	lamego		besides your complains which have no use for this channel ?
2007-10-18T03:35:00.000Z	scooby2	lamego	so how do i downgrade and get my configs back like you said
2007-10-18T03:36:00.000Z	lamego	scooby2	install feisty, and restore your config files from the backups that you have told us, you have
2007-10-18T03:37:00.000Z	lamego	scooby2	if your problem is with bacula, it maybe a problem specific to the bacula app upgrade, you could have tested it during development, it would be a bit more helpful
2007-10-18T03:38:00.000Z	scooby2	lamego	the package was the exact same version just minor revision difference as feisty
