2009-09-12T08:23:00.000Z	hentaiNeko		where can I get prior releases of ubuntu at
2009-09-12T08:23:00.000Z	hentaiNeko		like 8.10
2009-09-12T08:24:00.000Z	seidos	hentaiNeko	do you not have access to #ubuntu?
2009-09-12T08:25:00.000Z	hentaiNeko	seidos	this is #ubuntu is it not?
2009-09-12T08:25:00.000Z	seidos	hentaiNeko	he said ubuntu.com
2009-09-12T08:25:00.000Z	seidos	hentaiNeko	as in http://www.ubuntu.com
2009-09-12T08:30:00.000Z	seidos	hentaiNeko	I have used wget in ubuntu
2009-09-12T08:31:00.000Z	seidos	hentaiNeko	I'm pretty sure it does, if not apt-get install wget
2009-09-12T08:31:00.000Z	seidos	hentaiNeko	I would recommend the LTS version
2009-09-12T08:31:00.000Z	hentaiNeko	seidos	8.04?
2009-09-12T08:31:00.000Z	seidos	hentaiNeko	if I could do it over again, I wouldn't have upgraded to 8.10 and 9.04
2009-09-12T08:32:00.000Z	seidos	hentaiNeko	yes
2009-09-12T08:32:00.000Z	seidos	hentaiNeko	and if I could do it over again, I would install the 64bit version
2009-09-12T08:33:00.000Z	seidos	hentaiNeko	I found out later my processors were 64bit
2009-09-12T08:33:00.000Z	seidos	hentaiNeko	thought dualcore processors were 32bit
2009-09-12T08:33:00.000Z	hentaiNeko	seidos	when did I say it was dual core?
2009-09-12T08:34:00.000Z	hentaiNeko	seidos	oh you mean yourself
2009-09-12T08:34:00.000Z	seidos	hentaiNeko	didn't say you did
2009-09-12T08:34:00.000Z	seidos	hentaiNeko	yes, for myself, didn't know my cpu was 64bit
