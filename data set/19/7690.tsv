2007-08-03T08:31:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	yaustar	Did you get gsynaptic from the Debian repos.. and trying to use in Feisty?
2007-08-03T08:32:00.000Z	yaustar	Jack_Sparrow	I got GSynaptic from the Synaptic Package manager
2007-08-03T08:33:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	yaustar	What sources list did you add/change .. I dont see it in mine
2007-08-03T08:34:00.000Z	yaustar	Jack_Sparrow	 I just used the search tool to found GSynaptic on the Package Manager. I can get a screen grab if you need it?
2007-08-03T08:34:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	yaustar	Post your sources.lst on the pastebin.. that would be more helpful
2007-08-03T08:35:00.000Z	yaustar	Jack_Sparrow	 Where would I find the file?
2007-08-03T08:35:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	yaustar	/etc/apt/sources.list
2007-08-03T08:36:00.000Z	yaustar	Jack_Sparrow	.list file http://rafb.net/p/gemZLN53.html
2007-08-03T08:37:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	yaustar	My fault...  I was on a dapper system.. it is in my feisty system
2007-08-03T08:39:00.000Z	yaustar	Jack_Sparrow	Pici: Any ideas without the 'broken' log?
2007-08-03T08:39:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	yaustar	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2007-08-03T08:39:00.000Z	yaustar	Jack_Sparrow	 Ok..
2007-08-03T08:40:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	yaustar	Or sudo nano and restore your old xorg from a backup
2007-08-03T08:41:00.000Z	yaustar	Jack_Sparrow	Are you referring to restoring an old xorg.conf file?
2007-08-03T08:41:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	yaustar	yes
2007-08-03T08:41:00.000Z	yaustar	Jack_Sparrow	Done that, same problem
2007-08-03T08:41:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	yaustar	then reconfigure a new one.
2007-08-03T08:42:00.000Z	yaustar	Jack_Sparrow	If the xorg.conf file is broken, then why would it run 1 out 5 times?
2007-08-03T08:43:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	yaustar	All I can think of is an init of your gsynaptic touchapd or whatever it is.
