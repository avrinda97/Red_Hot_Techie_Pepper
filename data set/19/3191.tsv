2011-08-22T19:56:00.000Z	iceroot_	chewed-on	because you are not using sudo
2011-08-22T19:58:00.000Z	chewed-on	iceroot_	I did use sduo
2011-08-22T19:58:00.000Z	iceroot_	chewed-on	sudo fdisk -l  ?
2011-08-22T19:58:00.000Z	iceroot_	chewed-on	what you expect?
2011-08-22T19:59:00.000Z	chewed-on	iceroot_	to see my samsung external usb drie
2011-08-22T19:59:00.000Z	iceroot_	chewed-on	vbox-nonfree? usb enabled? sounds like the general usb-vbox issue. please use #vbox
2011-08-22T20:00:00.000Z	iceroot_	chewed-on	#vbox, the free version doesnt support usb, the nonfree version supports usb
2011-08-22T20:00:00.000Z	iceroot_	chewed-on	free as in free speech not as in free beer
2011-08-22T20:00:00.000Z	chewed-on	iceroot_	ah crap = /
2011-08-22T20:03:00.000Z	iceroot_	chewed-on	its not a ntfs issue
2011-08-22T20:03:00.000Z	iceroot_	chewed-on	i already told you why you dont see the drive
2011-08-22T20:04:00.000Z	iceroot_	chewed-on	sudo but again!!! that is not the problem
2011-08-22T20:04:00.000Z	iceroot_	chewed-on	you are using the "wrong" version of vbox which doesnt support usb
2011-08-22T20:05:00.000Z	chewed-on	iceroot_	I did type sudo! I just pasted the error it returned
2011-08-22T20:05:00.000Z	iceroot_	chewed-on	and you dont need to modprobe anything to write on ntfs
2011-08-22T20:05:00.000Z	chewed-on	iceroot_	waitâ€¦are you talking about mac osx or ubuntu ?
2011-08-22T20:06:00.000Z	iceroot_	chewed-on	you said you are using vbox and dont see your external usb drive there
2011-08-22T20:06:00.000Z	chewed-on	iceroot_	fdisk -l would show the hard drive it vbox free version had support for it.
2011-08-22T20:07:00.000Z	iceroot_	chewed-on	if you dont see the drive with fdisk -l you cant mount the drive because its not there
