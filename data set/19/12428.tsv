2005-09-06T16:19:00.000Z	vbgunz		umount: /media/cdrom0: device is busy
2005-09-06T16:19:00.000Z	vbgunz		eject: unmount of `/dev/hdc' failed
2005-09-06T16:19:00.000Z	vbgunz		this happened before but enough is enough... it really is frustrating

2005-09-06T16:21:00.000Z	d2dchat	vbgunz	i dont know where that si
2005-09-06T16:24:00.000Z	d2dchat	vbgunz	is there anyway to get the guide with apt-get?
2005-09-06T16:24:00.000Z	vbgunz	d2dchat	I don't believe Ubuntu will let you write to your Windows drive.... I believe it will mount read only
2005-09-06T16:24:00.000Z	d2dchat	vbgunz	actually, i dont need to download the unofficial guide right? I can just read it from this site?
2005-09-06T16:25:00.000Z	d2dchat	vbgunz	all i really want to do with the files on windows is play them in xmms
