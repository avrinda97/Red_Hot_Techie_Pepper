2005-08-04T12:38:00.000Z	Jemt		Greetings. I have just booted my brand new IBM X31 laptop based on Centrino Technology with the LiveCD. Everything seems to be working fine. But I'm wondering; Is there ANY chance, that Ubuntu could harm/damage my hardware? Ie by scaling the CPU badly or by bad battery management.
2005-08-04T12:39:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	Jemt	 not likely
2005-08-04T12:39:00.000Z	Jemt	hybrid_goth	> Sounds great. But how can you know that ?
2005-08-04T12:40:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	Jemt	 all it does is boot in ram and i have used the livecd on computer after computer
2005-08-04T12:40:00.000Z	Jemt	hybrid_goth	> Oh. Well, I want to install it too :)
2005-08-04T12:41:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	Jemt	no worries
2005-08-04T12:41:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	Jemt	dual boot or just ubuntu?
2005-08-04T12:41:00.000Z	Jemt	hybrid_goth	Dual. I'm developing in .NET so i can't get rid of Windows just yet :)
2005-08-04T12:41:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	Jemt	 gotmono.com
2005-08-04T12:42:00.000Z	Jemt	hybrid_goth	> Hopefully MONO will become just as good as .Net in the future
2005-08-04T12:42:00.000Z	Jemt	hybrid_goth	Yeah, I know :)
2005-08-04T12:42:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	Jemt	 yea it isnt as compatiable
2005-08-04T12:43:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	Jemt	 just another prove to show M$ services arent needed
2005-08-04T12:43:00.000Z	Jemt	hybrid_goth	> Heard ! :)
2005-08-04T12:43:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	Jemt	 you should be able
2005-08-04T12:43:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	Jemt	 the iwconfig tool would prolly do it
2005-08-04T12:44:00.000Z	Jemt	hybrid_goth	Great. I'll check it out :)
2005-08-04T12:44:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	Jemt	 have fun and best of luck
