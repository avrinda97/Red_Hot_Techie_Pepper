2011-06-10T01:38:00.000Z	Xase		I had to reinstall ubuntu after gnome 3 failed to run properly on this laptop.... on my desktop however it flies @klown, just don't blame us when it doesn't work.
2011-06-10T01:39:00.000Z	Xase		I highly recommend trying it klown if you don't mind tinkering... however, just like they've said previously... not fully supported, I'd say wait till oneiric is a bit more stable.
2011-06-10T01:39:00.000Z	Xase		Well there is a way to back up, depending on how you do the install
2011-06-10T01:39:00.000Z	Xase		for some ppa-purge fixed it... others... no.
2011-06-10T01:40:00.000Z	Xase		I'd recommend a reinstall or recovery if things goterible.
2011-06-10T01:40:00.000Z	Xase		go terrible*
2011-06-10T01:40:00.000Z	Xase		Anyone know why an AMD computer with an AMD vision setup on Natty Narwhal would be... "Laggy" ?
2011-06-10T01:40:00.000Z	klown	Xase	I may try it, the look of some of the new gnome3 shells are pretty nice.  Would def make it worth it.  I'm sure upgrading later would require a full install.
2011-06-10T01:41:00.000Z	Xase	klown	you might want to try doing what I do from now on if you're a bit familiar with linux, and keep a seperate home partition.
2011-06-10T01:41:00.000Z	Xase		That way all your really vital files remain intact.
2011-06-10T01:42:00.000Z	klown	Xase	thats a good idea..Maybe I'll try it if gnome 3 breaks :P
2011-06-10T01:42:00.000Z	Xase		It's good for tinkering and if and when stuff breaks, you don't have to go oh crap! where's my backup.
2011-06-10T01:43:00.000Z	Xase		I'm getting terrible lag on an ATI/AMD system with 4gigs of ram =/
2011-06-10T01:43:00.000Z	klown		Upgrade to 8gb :P
2011-06-10T01:43:00.000Z	Xase		videos are choppy and there's an obvious delay with typing and stuff actually apppearing on screen...
2011-06-10T01:43:00.000Z	Xase		It wouldn't be a big deal if this wasn't being built as an arcade machine.
2011-06-10T01:43:00.000Z	Xase		It's not the ram...
2011-06-10T01:43:00.000Z	Xase		I'm sure it's the gfx card itself
2011-06-10T01:43:00.000Z	klown	Xase	I was kidding.
