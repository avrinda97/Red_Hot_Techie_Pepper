2010-07-22T05:01:00.000Z	randy_	osmodivs	yeah, it can get pretty hairy at this point.  its possible that several things could be happening.  what is most likely, though, is that there is an issue with drivers and your network card, whatever that may be
2010-07-22T05:02:00.000Z	randy_	osmodivs	in the even that you can successfully boot into a LiveCD, the most reliable method of determining network connectivity if through the command line, using the ipconfig command
2010-07-22T05:02:00.000Z	randy_	osmodivs	the ifconfig command is much like the ipconfig command from windows, but much much more powerful
2010-07-22T05:03:00.000Z	randy_	osmodivs	in order to determine, quickly, wether or not your network card was detected properly, you should check what is listed from simply running 'ipconfig' in the terminal
2010-07-22T05:03:00.000Z	randy_	osmodivs	if you are using a Ethernet connection, there should be at least one ethernet port listed, starting with '
2010-07-22T05:04:00.000Z	randy_	osmodivs	eth0, and eth1 for the second ethernet port, etc...
2010-07-22T05:04:00.000Z	randy_	osmodivs	wireless cards, generally more tricky to work with, should have an interface name of something like wlan0 and such
2010-07-22T05:06:00.000Z	randy_	osmodivs	are you trying to use wireless?
2010-07-22T05:06:00.000Z	randy_	osmodivs	ifconfig not iwconfig
2010-07-22T05:07:00.000Z	randy_	osmodivs	ifconfig is for all network interfaces (if = interface) iwconfig is just for wireless interfaces (iw = interface, wireless)
