2005-04-30T14:24:00.000Z	holycow	kakalto	how do you define good?
2005-04-30T14:25:00.000Z	holycow	kakalto	don't worry :)
2005-04-30T14:25:00.000Z	holycow	kakalto	oh thats cool, i miss konqueror my self
2005-04-30T14:26:00.000Z	kakalto	holycow	absolutely
2005-04-30T14:26:00.000Z	holycow	kakalto	yes they are, konq is for power users
2005-04-30T14:28:00.000Z	holycow	kakalto	i would say gnome 2.10 has addressed that to some degree with the new menus
2005-04-30T14:28:00.000Z	kakalto	holycow	I know this much: under gentoo, my sound card had REAL ISSUES because of ALSA (new) and OSS (old)
2005-04-30T14:28:00.000Z	kakalto	holycow	I'll have to try gnome 2.10 out some time
2005-04-30T14:29:00.000Z	holycow	kakalto	just install hoary, it uses it
2005-04-30T14:29:00.000Z	kakalto	holycow	I did
2005-04-30T14:30:00.000Z	kakalto	holycow	any ideas of what file(s) in my home folder would make gnome screw up on login?
2005-04-30T14:31:00.000Z	holycow	kakalto	i find that having a good big picture understanding of the subsystems helps in debugging issues, most of the stuff on the net focuses very tightly to specific isues
2005-04-30T14:56:00.000Z	kakalto	holycow	true that.
2005-05-01T14:07:00.000Z	holycow	kakalto	only the gpl packages
2005-05-01T14:08:00.000Z	kakalto	holycow	so there's different versions?
2005-05-01T14:08:00.000Z	kakalto	holycow	or do you mean I can copy Xandros, so long as I don't copy the proprietory packages?
2005-05-01T14:09:00.000Z	holycow	kakalto	xandros is based on debian
2005-05-01T14:10:00.000Z	kakalto	holycow	so I can't just copy the cd
2005-05-01T14:11:00.000Z	holycow	kakalto	correct
