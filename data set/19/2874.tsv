2011-03-23T21:48:00.000Z	naptastic		What do I have to add to my /etc/apt/mirror.list to make my local apt-mirror so I can *install* from it and not just *update*?
2011-03-23T21:49:00.000Z	iceroot	naptastic	you install from /etc/apt/sources.list and you mirror other repos from /etc/apt/mirror.list
2011-03-23T21:50:00.000Z	iceroot	naptastic	apt-mirrir is reading the mirror-file, apt-get is reading the sources.list
2011-03-23T21:50:00.000Z	naptastic	iceroot	right. My client is booting from PXE into the Ubuntu installer, which works, but if I tell it to install from my local repository, it says the necessary files aren't there.
2011-03-23T21:51:00.000Z	iceroot	naptastic	you have a Packages.gz there?
2011-03-23T21:52:00.000Z	naptastic	iceroot	where specifically?
2011-03-23T21:52:00.000Z	iceroot	naptastic	in your local repo
2011-03-23T21:53:00.000Z	naptastic	iceroot	the local repo is a big place :-) where should it be relative to mirror/archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu?
2011-03-23T21:53:00.000Z	iceroot	naptastic	in the branche, e.g. maverick/i386 also "all" and "amd64" have there own Packages.gz
2011-03-23T21:54:00.000Z	naptastic	iceroot	yes, there are Packages.gz files there.
2011-03-23T21:54:00.000Z	iceroot	naptastic	and what is "apt-get update" telling?
2011-03-23T21:55:00.000Z	naptastic	iceroot	apt-get update and apt-get upgrade work fine on all my local clients. Installing fails. Lemme go get the exact error message...
2011-03-23T21:56:00.000Z	iceroot	naptastic	if installing fails, sound like the Packages.gz is out of sync with the packages the repo contains
2011-03-23T21:59:00.000Z	naptastic	iceroot	I can understand that; does Packages.gz represent the packages from the original release, or does it keep up with updates?
2011-03-23T21:59:00.000Z	naptastic	iceroot	I'm pretty sure I've cleaned out all the original packages and just have the updated versions...
2011-03-23T22:00:00.000Z	iceroot	naptastic	Packages and Packages.gz contains the same content. i dont know if apt-mirror is syncing the Packages or if it is calling something like apt-archive which is building the Packages
2011-03-23T22:01:00.000Z	naptastic	iceroot	:-/ well, . . . I'mma go symlink... something... to something else... or something. Thanks!
2011-03-23T22:01:00.000Z	iceroot	naptastic	have a look at the Packages(.gz) if it is sharing the same packages as in your repo
2011-03-23T22:03:00.000Z	iceroot	naptastic	if you are not syncing all packages but syning the packages.gz you shuld rebuid it with apt-ftparchive
