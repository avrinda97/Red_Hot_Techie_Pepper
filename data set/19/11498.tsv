2006-07-27T10:28:00.000Z	dr_willis	s_spiff	 it also depends on what you did to the fstab

2006-07-27T10:30:00.000Z	s_spiff	dr_willis	but it wont mount it at boot right?
2006-07-27T10:31:00.000Z	dr_willis	s_spiff	 it should auto mount
2006-07-27T10:31:00.000Z	dr_willis	s_spiff	 thats what the noauto option is for. :P
2006-07-27T10:31:00.000Z	s_spiff	dr_willis	by adding noauto it will or will not mount?
2006-07-27T10:32:00.000Z	s_spiff	dr_willis	thanks
2006-07-27T10:32:00.000Z	dr_willis	s_spiff	 its time to read the mount man pages and the fstab man pages. :P and google for some mounting tutorials.. its worth the effort to learn this stiff  VERY well. :)
