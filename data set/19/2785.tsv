2010-01-06T03:26:00.000Z	dooglus_	DarkS7ar1	did you pastebin it?  I had to go for a while so may have missed it.
2010-01-06T03:27:00.000Z	DarkS7ar1	dooglus_	what do u want me to pastebin? i'll do it
2010-01-06T03:27:00.000Z	dooglus_	DarkS7ar1	your interaction with ndiswrapper
2010-01-06T03:28:00.000Z	DarkS7ar1	dooglus_	when i start ndiswrapper i get "Unable to see if hardware is present"
2010-01-06T03:29:00.000Z	dooglus_	DarkS7ar1	can you pastebin the interaction?
2010-01-06T03:29:00.000Z	dooglus_	DarkS7ar1	so I can see what you're doing wrong
2010-01-06T03:30:00.000Z	DarkS7ar1	dooglus_	but how to find the interaction
2010-01-06T03:30:00.000Z	dooglus_	DarkS7ar1	I mean copy/paste your terminal session
2010-01-06T03:31:00.000Z	DarkS7ar1	dooglus_	im startin' it through the menu not terminal
2010-01-06T03:32:00.000Z	DarkS7ar1	dooglus_	 was that for me
2010-01-06T03:33:00.000Z	dooglus_	DarkS7ar1	try these steps: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/Ndiswrapper#Installing%20Windows%20driver
2010-01-06T03:35:00.000Z	DarkS7ar1	dooglus_	im also getting this error after i installed ndiswrapper driver:WARNING: All config files need .conf: /etc/modprobe.d/ndiswrapper, it will be ignored in a future release.
2010-01-06T03:36:00.000Z	dooglus_	DarkS7ar1	what version of ubuntu do you have?
2010-01-06T03:36:00.000Z	dooglus_	DarkS7ar1	I ask because my one has a .conf ending: chris@chris-laptop:/etc/modprobe.d$ ls -l ndis*
2010-01-06T03:38:00.000Z	DarkS7ar1	dooglus_	see what i get when ndiswrapper -l :device (168C:002A) present (alternate driver: ath9k)
2010-01-06T03:42:00.000Z	dooglus_	DarkS7ar1	so ndiswrapper is seeing your device
2010-01-06T03:43:00.000Z	dooglus_	DarkS7ar1	you need to get the windows driver for it
2010-01-06T03:45:00.000Z	DarkS7ar1	dooglus_	i have already installed it. the confusing thing is that i have 2 drivers from my manufacturer and just installed the one who has driver for xp
