2008-05-08T17:52:00.000Z	justAsset		i've instructions how to achieve that
2008-05-08T17:52:00.000Z	justAsset		and one of the steps is to install ubuntu-base and ubuntu-desktop
2008-05-08T17:52:00.000Z	joaopinto		sorry, I have no experience with RAID hw
2008-05-08T17:53:00.000Z	joaopinto	justAsset	that would be: sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
2008-05-08T17:53:00.000Z	joaopinto		from the command line, assuming at that part of the instructions you already did a base install on the hd
2008-05-08T17:53:00.000Z	justAsset	joaopinto	it doesn't want to install desktop from live cd
