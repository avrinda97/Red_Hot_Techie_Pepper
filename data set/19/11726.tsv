2006-04-16T08:33:00.000Z	UncleD		ANyone here use lynx?
2006-04-16T08:34:00.000Z	UncleD		I'm using lynx on a page where the only way to submit is to click on a 'radio' button. I can toggle the radio button, but i cant seem to force the submission. Any ideas?
2006-04-16T08:35:00.000Z	UncleD		Are there any console based alternatives to lynx that are better?
2006-04-16T08:35:00.000Z	mwe	UncleD	highlight it and press right arrow?
2006-04-16T08:35:00.000Z	UncleD	mwe	I tried the right arrow, no success.
2006-04-16T08:36:00.000Z	mwe	UncleD	hmm
2006-04-16T08:36:00.000Z	mwe	UncleD	sounds like a crappy web site though
2006-04-16T08:36:00.000Z	mwe	UncleD	who makes a web site submit with a radio button?
2006-04-16T08:37:00.000Z	UncleD	mwe	I keep getting the error "One radio button must be checked at all times"
2006-04-16T08:38:00.000Z	mwe	UncleD	I don't know why
2006-04-16T08:40:00.000Z	UncleD	mwe	here's an example -> http://www.silktide.com/index.php?node=18448&url=http://www.i3brains.com/
2006-04-16T08:45:00.000Z	mwe	UncleD	the page seems to be broken for lynx
2006-04-16T08:46:00.000Z	mwe	UncleD	I don't think it understands the page
2006-04-16T08:46:00.000Z	UncleD	mwe	know a browser that does?
2006-04-16T08:47:00.000Z	mwe	UncleD	firefox
2006-04-16T08:49:00.000Z	UncleD	mwe	console based browser?
2006-04-16T08:49:00.000Z	UncleD	mwe	im in terminal mode
2006-04-16T08:49:00.000Z	mwe	UncleD	I haven't tried. w3c maybe or elinks
