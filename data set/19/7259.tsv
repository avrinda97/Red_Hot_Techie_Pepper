2007-09-20T13:38:00.000Z	calpolyt		i do have it
2007-09-20T13:39:00.000Z	calpolyt		yes
2007-09-20T13:39:00.000Z	calpolyt		i can connect just fine to my WEP home network
2007-09-20T13:39:00.000Z	calpolyt		but i need WPA to connect to the LEAP network at my campus
2007-09-20T13:41:00.000Z	calpolyt		i tried to; there's a guest network on campus as well and i couldnt connect to it either.
2007-09-20T13:42:00.000Z	calpolyt		right
2007-09-20T13:42:00.000Z	calpolyt		it wont give me WPA options. only WEP
2007-09-20T13:42:00.000Z	calpolyt		im guessing it needs to be configured somehow
2007-09-20T13:43:00.000Z	calpolyt		and i dont know where or how to do that exactly
2007-09-20T13:43:00.000Z	calpolyt		the GUI isnt very exhaustive
2007-09-20T13:43:00.000Z	rausb0	calpolyt	network manager cannot work with ralink chipsets
2007-09-20T13:49:00.000Z	rausb0	calpolyt	fix what?
2007-09-20T13:49:00.000Z	rausb0	calpolyt	wrong
2007-09-20T13:53:00.000Z	rausb0	calpolyt	for LEAP you are out of luck. the old drivers only support WPA-PSK, not LEAP. the new drivers (ralink driver rewrite) are too unstable now.
2007-09-20T13:54:00.000Z	rausb0	calpolyt	if the driver rewrite becomes stable, it will work with wpa_supplicant and you can use all kinds of WPA.
2007-09-20T13:56:00.000Z	rausb0	calpolyt	so for now, you can only do unencrypted and WEP using network manager, or WPA-PSK using some awkward iwpriv commands
2007-09-20T14:03:00.000Z	calpolyt	rausb0	last question regarding WPA; if i were to buy a new wireless card, what chipset would work best with feisty?
2007-09-20T14:04:00.000Z	rausb0	calpolyt	atheros works well with the madwifi driver, but there are revisions of the atheros chipset which are too new for the driver.
2007-09-20T14:05:00.000Z	rausb0	calpolyt	the problem is how to know which card has which chipset. the card manufacturers keep changing chipsets frequently and without notice.
