2007-06-29T16:51:00.000Z	Zaibot	ReK_	I'll download it
2007-06-29T16:52:00.000Z	ReK_	Zaibot	http://madwifi.org/wiki/UserDocs/Distro/Ubuntu
2007-06-29T16:56:00.000Z	Zaibot	ReK_	is there any way to download linux-restricted-modules when im on xp? the madwifi.com download didnt work
2007-06-29T16:56:00.000Z	Zaibot	ReK_	or download madwifi drivers somewhere else
2007-06-29T16:57:00.000Z	ReK_	Zaibot	did you install ubuntu from the desktop cd img?
2007-06-29T16:58:00.000Z	Zaibot	ReK_	I installed it from a CD that I downloaded from the website
2007-06-29T16:58:00.000Z	ReK_	Zaibot	did you change any of the options on the download, or just hit the download button
2007-06-29T05:00:00.000Z	Zaibot	ReK_	It has worked fine so far and I've used it for at least a month so it shouldn't be a faulty download. And no, I didn't change anything. I'm downloading madwifi now
2007-06-29T05:00:00.000Z	ReK_	Zaibot	then you already have linux-restricted-modules-common, and you just need the tools pkg listed on that page. then go to the madwifi homepage and look for the newbie docs
2007-06-29T05:00:00.000Z	ReK_	Zaibot	wait, your wireless worked fine and now it doesnt?
2007-06-29T05:01:00.000Z	Zaibot	ReK_	yes, i tried updating linux.restricted-modules and there was some error when i did it, and when i restarted my computer it didnt find the wifi properly
2007-06-29T05:01:00.000Z	Zaibot	ReK_	I didnt change any settings
2007-06-29T05:02:00.000Z	ReK_	Zaibot	that's why then. linux-restricted-modules contains madwifi, which was installed and working without you knowing it. updating it broke it. try rolling it back
2007-06-29T05:03:00.000Z	Zaibot	ReK_	how do i roll it back?
2007-06-29T05:03:00.000Z	ReK_	Zaibot	no idea, ask someone else, but that's what you need to do to fix it, im pretty sure
2007-06-29T05:04:00.000Z	Zaibot	ReK_	Okey, thanks for your help
