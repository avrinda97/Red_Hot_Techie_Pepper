2011-06-16T19:40:00.000Z	alienmindtrick		 , E:Some index files failed to download. They have been ignored, or old ones used instead.
2011-06-16T19:41:00.000Z	Pici	alienmindtrick	Remove the repository, it looks like the PPA was deleted.

2011-06-22T18:08:00.000Z	alienmindtrick	Pici	 thanks.  here it is:  http://paste.ubuntu.com/630799/
2011-06-22T18:09:00.000Z	alienmindtrick	Pici	i think that i should add more information to that and try again. wait one, please.
2011-06-22T18:17:00.000Z	Pici	alienmindtrick	I think you mentioned earlier that you had installed the gnome3 ppa? If so, that is unsupported, we don't know what changes and/or problems that will cause for you.
2011-06-22T18:18:00.000Z	alienmindtrick	Pici	this problem started when i downloaded 11.04, and i didn't change the gnome3 ppa until yesterday. this problem predates that.
2011-06-22T18:18:00.000Z	alienmindtrick	Pici	and i've just discovered that now i can't unlock ANY keys
2011-06-22T18:21:00.000Z	Pici	alienmindtrick	did you try any of these fixes before you installed the ppa?
2011-06-22T18:21:00.000Z	alienmindtrick	Pici	yes
2011-06-22T18:22:00.000Z	alienmindtrick	Pici	i also discovered, and should have added this to the longer post, that even if i unlock a key, when i restart my machine, it's locked again
2011-06-22T18:23:00.000Z	Pici	alienmindtrick	I don't have a desktop install here to test along with you, but I'd make sure that your gnome config files in your home directory are all owned by you.
2011-06-22T18:26:00.000Z	alienmindtrick	Pici	do you have a link to how i'd do that, or can you tell me how?
2011-06-22T18:41:00.000Z	Pici	alienmindtrick	Sorry, got sidetracked with real work on my end.  Did you figure things out?
2011-06-22T18:41:00.000Z	alienmindtrick	Pici	no
2011-06-22T18:42:00.000Z	Pici	alienmindtrick	sudo chown -R $USER:$USER ~/.config/ ~/.gnome*
2011-06-22T18:42:00.000Z	Pici	alienmindtrick	BluesKaj: both of you stop it.
2011-06-22T18:52:00.000Z	alienmindtrick	Pici	no change. i still get 3 login prompts.
