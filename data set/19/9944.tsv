2006-09-11T15:13:00.000Z	Adam		(according to the guide, it should be at "Applications -> Accessories -> Archive Manager", but it isn't.
2006-09-11T15:13:00.000Z	Adam		will it unrar?
2006-09-11T15:13:00.000Z	sethk	Adam	perhaps the guide is a bit off or the menus have changed.  look around.
2006-09-11T15:14:00.000Z	Adam	sethk	I definitely have "Archive Manager" installed, but it's just not on the menu.
2006-09-11T15:15:00.000Z	sethk	Adam	and you installed it with apt-get?
2006-09-11T15:15:00.000Z	Adam	sethk	nope, it came preinstalled.
2006-09-11T15:15:00.000Z	sethk	Adam	what do you mean?  you bought a machine with linux already on it?
2006-09-11T15:16:00.000Z	Adam	sethk	i.e. it got installed along with Dapper 6.06
2006-09-11T15:16:00.000Z	sethk	Adam	that's not preinstalled, that just means it's part of the default install set.  effectively the answer to my question is yes.  sounds like a dapper bug.

2006-09-11T15:53:00.000Z	sethk	Adam	too late, he's gone.  :)
2006-09-11T15:53:00.000Z	sethk	Adam	but thanks
2006-09-11T15:53:00.000Z	Adam	sethk	sure :)
2006-09-12T16:03:00.000Z	Adam	sethk	before someone got their eye poked out ;)
2006-09-12T16:14:00.000Z	sethk	Adam	I think he just wants to separate iptables info from all other info
2006-09-12T16:24:00.000Z	sethk	Adam	grep rc from your ~/.bash_history file
2006-09-12T16:28:00.000Z	Adam	sethk	you mean like so? -> "grep rc .bash_history". nothing interesting, why?
2006-09-12T16:28:00.000Z	sethk	Adam	grep rc ~/.bash_history
2006-09-12T16:30:00.000Z	Adam	sethk	ah, ok :)
