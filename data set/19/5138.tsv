2008-08-23T11:52:00.000Z	Uriens		does anyone know how to use virtualhosts with SSL in apache2?
2008-08-23T11:52:00.000Z	Uriens		I have some different domains working in my server, and I only want to enable SSL for one of them, but when I enable SSL, it is enabled for all hosts, displaying inapropiate content for the other hosts when doing https://no-ssl-domain
2008-08-23T11:53:00.000Z	Uriens		any way to solve it?
2008-08-23T11:53:00.000Z	Flannel	Uriens	you'd just use it on that particular virtual host, yeah.
2008-08-23T11:53:00.000Z	Flannel	Uriens	Either by binding virtual hosts to a port, or otherwise.
2008-08-23T11:54:00.000Z	Uriens	Flannel	binding, you mean using a diferent port for each domain?
2008-08-23T11:55:00.000Z	Flannel	Uriens	https runs on port 443 while http runs on port 80. so.. technically yes, different ports, but not in the way it sounds.
2008-08-23T11:56:00.000Z	Flannel	Uriens	NameVirtualHost blah:80  and then <VirtualHost blah:80> as the first two lines (add the :80) on the http-only ones
2008-08-23T11:56:00.000Z	Uriens	Flannel	i have read that no virtualhosts are possible in the SSL layer
2008-08-23T11:56:00.000Z	Flannel	Uriens	so, you won't be able to view those sites with https then.
2008-08-23T11:57:00.000Z	Flannel	Uriens	Isn't that what you were trying to accomplish?
2008-08-23T11:58:00.000Z	Flannel	Uriens	er... you just said it was working.
2008-08-23T11:58:00.000Z	Flannel	Uriens	no, if you've bound those other virtualhosts to only port 80, they won't work with 443 (https)
2008-08-23T11:59:00.000Z	Flannel	Uriens	So, your problem is just with general virtual host disambiguation.  You might find more help with that in #apache
2008-08-23T12:02:00.000Z	Uriens	Flannel	let's talk with you in private mode
2008-08-23T23:58:00.000Z	Flannel	Uriens	Move squirrel mail from where to where?
2008-08-23T23:59:00.000Z	Flannel	Uriens	you want to transfer email from one server to another, basically?  Is the destination IMAP?
2008-08-24T00:00:00.000Z	Flannel	Uriens	Mmm, you answered that.  Is it a remote IMAP or local IMAP?
