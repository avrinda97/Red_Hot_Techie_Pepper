2012-10-05T00:13:00.000Z	crazydip		why does bzr branch ubuntu:<package> download quantal and not precise?
2012-10-05T00:14:00.000Z	trism	crazydip	because it is the current dev version, if you want precise, bzr branch lp:ubuntu/precise/package
2012-10-05T00:15:00.000Z	trism	crazydip	though the branches are kind of all over the place so you may not necessarily get what you want there
2012-10-05T00:15:00.000Z	crazydip	trism	aye, makes sense though dev version is what's usually needed when fetching source not current stable
2012-10-12T20:47:00.000Z	trism	crazydip	it is already gone in 12.10
2012-10-12T20:47:00.000Z	crazydip	trism	good :) how's the upgrade from 12.04 going to look like, will be be removed or kept?
2012-10-12T20:48:00.000Z	trism	crazydip	the packages are there but they are empty
2012-10-12T20:49:00.000Z	crazydip	trism	ok, the normal "transitional package" deal - thanks!
2012-10-21T04:50:00.000Z	trism	crazydip	bug 1065806
2012-10-21T04:50:00.000Z	crazydip	trism	good thing i have meld installed and working :D
2012-10-23T00:07:00.000Z	trism	crazydip	you could try com.canonical.unity.dash home-lens-ordering , not played with it myself though
2012-10-23T00:08:00.000Z	crazydip	trism	thanks! is this dbus?
2012-10-23T00:08:00.000Z	trism	crazydip	gsettings/dconf-editor
2012-10-23T00:08:00.000Z	crazydip	trism	ahh, ok :)
2012-10-23T00:08:00.000Z	trism	crazydip	though it does use dbus underneath
2012-10-23T00:13:00.000Z	trism	crazydip	hmm unfortunately seems to make no difference here
2012-10-23T00:15:00.000Z	crazydip	trism	hrm, I also don't see where the order of the scorpes is located for the file and application lenses
2012-10-23T00:31:00.000Z	trism	crazydip	#ubuntu-unity maybe?
2012-10-23T00:31:00.000Z	crazydip	trism	thanks!
