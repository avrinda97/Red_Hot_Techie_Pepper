2006-05-12T09:47:00.000Z	holycow	ferronica	just ask
2006-05-12T09:49:00.000Z	holycow	ferronica	don't install it, extract it and just double click on the binary
2006-05-12T09:49:00.000Z	holycow	ferronica	wait for dapper to be released it will have 1.5 in it properly packaged
2006-05-12T09:51:00.000Z	holycow	ferronica	not really, most of the instructions are fairly trivial.  its NEVER possible to put ALL of the knowledge required in every single tutorial
2006-05-12T09:52:00.000Z	holycow	ferronica	part of learning a new tool is discovering what skills you don't have and googling them
2006-05-12T09:52:00.000Z	holycow	ferronica	right click on file and select extract
2006-05-12T09:57:00.000Z	holycow	ferronica	i don't mean to be mean, i strongly urge you to go back to windows or get a mac
2006-05-12T09:57:00.000Z	holycow	ferronica	you don't seem to be ready to 'unlearn' a lot of things
2006-05-12T10:02:00.000Z	holycow	ferronica	just go back to windows, forget linux
2006-05-12T10:02:00.000Z	holycow	ferronica	you will never be happy here
2006-05-12T10:02:00.000Z	ferronica	holycow	r u happy???
2006-05-12T10:08:00.000Z	holycow	ferronica	i also use it because it is an incredibly rich,sophisticated and sane computing envrionment as well as having some serious implications for democracy
2006-05-12T10:09:00.000Z	holycow	ferronica	that is the stupidest statement ever
2006-05-12T10:09:00.000Z	holycow	ferronica	you clearly don't know you are in a jail then
2006-05-12T10:11:00.000Z	holycow	ferronica	sounds like you don't care about freedom, just the convenience of being a consumer
2006-05-12T10:11:00.000Z	holycow	ferronica	good luck with that
