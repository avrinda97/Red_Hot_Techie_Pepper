2011-11-09T21:30:00.000Z	johnnychimpo		anyone out there
2011-11-09T21:31:00.000Z	jstoone	johnnychimpo	What's your problem?
2011-11-09T21:32:00.000Z	jstoone	johnnychimpo	Whoch model is it?
2011-11-09T21:32:00.000Z	jstoone	johnnychimpo	which*
2011-11-09T21:33:00.000Z	jstoone	johnnychimpo	Ok, well have you enabled the drivers in "Hardware Drivers" - (Press Win/Super-key and then write "Driver" choose the first program)
2011-11-09T21:34:00.000Z	jstoone	johnnychimpo	Sorry it's called "Additional Drivers"
2011-11-09T21:34:00.000Z	jstoone	johnnychimpo	Is it activated?
2011-11-09T21:36:00.000Z	jstoone	johnnychimpo	Cool, well in my case my laptop has a GeForce graphics, but I've had to actually DISABLE my drivers to get the maximum out of my card ;)
2011-11-09T21:36:00.000Z	jstoone	johnnychimpo	Oh.. well don't be afraid, mine says that too ;)
2011-11-09T21:37:00.000Z	jstoone	johnnychimpo	Even if Activate the card again, it doesn't say GForce. I think it's because we've got some pretty newish GPUs and they're not recognized by the system yet ;)
2011-11-09T21:38:00.000Z	jstoone	johnnychimpo	Well, would you test something for me ?
2011-11-09T21:48:00.000Z	jstoone	johnnychimpo	Yupp.
2011-11-09T21:40:00.000Z	jstoone	johnnychimpo	could you try to DISABLE the Gaphics Driver in your "Additional Drivers" tab, reboot, and then test, and tell if it makes any difference?
2011-11-09T21:40:00.000Z	jstoone	johnnychimpo	It truely does for me.
2011-11-09T21:40:00.000Z	jstoone	johnnychimpo	Open terminal and write "Free"
2011-11-09T21:41:00.000Z	jstoone	johnnychimpo	just "free" sorry
2011-11-09T21:42:00.000Z	jstoone	johnnychimpo	Uff.. maybe you're not that familiar with IRC yet, but you should make a habbit of pasting suck outputs into sites like - pastebinit.com - or the like.
2011-11-09T21:43:00.000Z	jstoone	johnnychimpo	imagine everyone pasting their code and .conf files into here, it would be a mess ;)
2011-11-09T21:47:00.000Z	jstoone	johnnychimpo	Try disabling, reboot, test and give us some feedback of the changes. Is that a bad idea? CJKay?
