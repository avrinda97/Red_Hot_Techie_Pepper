2009-06-27T08:04:00.000Z	Myst_		hello, can anyone tell me how to burn a dvd with the contents of a folder in command line mode?
2009-06-27T08:05:00.000Z	tekteen	Myst_	is it a data dvd?
2009-06-27T08:06:00.000Z	Myst_	tekteen	yes it will be a data dvd
2009-06-27T08:06:00.000Z	tekteen	Myst_	I think you want to look at growisofs
2009-06-27T08:07:00.000Z	Myst_	tekteen	just was looking at it but can't seem to get it to work
2009-06-27T08:07:00.000Z	tekteen	Myst_	I am not sure if I can help, but what did you try?
2009-06-27T08:10:00.000Z	Myst_	tekteen	growisofs -dvd-compat -Z /dev/dvd=/tmp/backup.iso and other variations... all basically do the same thing but dont actually write anything
2009-06-27T08:12:00.000Z	tekteen	Myst_	growisofs -dvd-compat -Z /dev/dvd=/tmp/backup.iso is not the correct format
2009-06-27T08:13:00.000Z	tekteen	Myst_	/dev/dvd=/tmp/backup.iso does not make sense. /dev/dvd is supposed to be the dvd burner
2009-06-27T08:15:00.000Z	Myst_	tekteen	i have been following a few different websites but im still new to everything...
2009-06-27T08:16:00.000Z	tekteen	Myst_	that is ok :-). You will eventually learn
2009-06-27T08:17:00.000Z	Myst_	tekteen	of everything i have been able to do with linux... burning a cd from the command line has been the only thing i havent been able to figure out...
2009-06-27T08:17:00.000Z	tekteen	Myst_	I have never really tried to do it. I only burn all ready made isos
2009-06-27T08:18:00.000Z	Myst_	tekteen	see i created my own ISO it mkisofs
2009-06-27T08:18:00.000Z	tekteen	Myst_	you did?
2009-06-27T08:18:00.000Z	tekteen	Myst_	why didn't you say so?!
2009-06-27T08:19:00.000Z	tekteen	Myst_	cdrecord file.iso
2009-06-27T08:19:00.000Z	Myst_	tekteen	let me check
2009-06-27T08:24:00.000Z	Myst_	tekteen	sudo mkisofs -r -o /tmp/backup.iso -joliet-long /home/backup
