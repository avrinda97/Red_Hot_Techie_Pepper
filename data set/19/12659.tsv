2005-07-29T13:59:00.000Z	v1ru5		i cannot get GRUB installed from the Ubuntu install. (re-installed/tried about 8 times now, kinda pissed) Everything else works out just fine but not it. IS THERE AN ALTERNATIVE WAY (like putting it to a floppy [how?] ) OF GETTING GRUB TO WORK??
2005-07-29T14:00:00.000Z	bob2	v1ru5	please don't take your frustration out on strangers you're asking for help from
2005-07-29T14:00:00.000Z	bob2	v1ru5	I'd assume your cd is busted until you check and show otherwise
2005-07-29T14:01:00.000Z	v1ru5	bob2	umm. ok. Is GRUB Legacy same as GRUB?
2005-07-29T14:01:00.000Z	bob2	v1ru5	I've never heard of "grub legacy"
2005-07-29T14:02:00.000Z	v1ru5	bob2	well it's on GNU org's pages. They only list GRUB Legacy and GRUB2. and the legacy is only available as a test download.. Where to get GRUB the regular version? (i mean, you probably know how to build a boot floppy with it)
2005-07-29T14:03:00.000Z	bob2	v1ru5	grub is grub legacy
2005-07-29T14:33:00.000Z	bob2	v1ru5	if you have a question, ask it in the channel
2005-07-29T06:11:00.000Z	bob2	v1ru5	please name one virus in the wild that has affected users in the past 5 years
2005-07-29T06:12:00.000Z	v1ru5	bob2	bliss?
2005-07-29T06:12:00.000Z	bob2	v1ru5	url to media coverage of it affecting users?
2005-07-29T06:13:00.000Z	bob2	v1ru5	no
2005-07-29T06:14:00.000Z	bob2	v1ru5	please stop being silly
2005-07-29T06:14:00.000Z	v1ru5	bob2	sorry, but i am really, really really, REALLY FUCKING PISSED here.
2005-07-29T06:14:00.000Z	bob2	v1ru5	that's awesome, but don't take it out on us
2005-07-29T06:14:00.000Z	bob2	v1ru5	go and have a cup of tea or go for a walk or something
2005-07-29T06:16:00.000Z	bob2	v1ru5	have you verified the cd yet?
2005-07-29T06:17:00.000Z	bob2	v1ru5	then go do that before whinging
2005-07-31T15:18:00.000Z	v1ru5	bob2	whee bob, i got the right md5 summed iso now :) but i have to wait for about 10 hours before i can get it burned; my win XP doesn't let me burn anything.. ("power convert error" or something")
