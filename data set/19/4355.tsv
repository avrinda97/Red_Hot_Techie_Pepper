2009-01-31T02:58:00.000Z	SiDi	matrixx02	do you have an SSH server setup on a linux server which has FULL access to the internet  ?that's the first step. then only you can use SSH from a proxified connection in order to login on your server
2009-01-31T02:59:00.000Z	SiDi	matrixx02	oh yeh i see
2009-01-31T02:59:00.000Z	SiDi	matrixx02	you need to configure the SSH server to run on port 443, and then use "ssh -P 443 user@server", sorry, forgot this
2009-01-31T02:59:00.000Z	matrixx02	SiDi	i think i have to setup somethink in ubuntu ssh
