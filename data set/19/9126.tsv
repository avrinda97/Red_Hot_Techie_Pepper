2007-07-26T09:46:00.000Z	umop-apisdn	Some_Person	is there an issue with using gparted?
2007-07-26T09:47:00.000Z	Some_Person	umop-apisdn	it wont let me resize the ext3 partition to use the unallocated space
2007-07-26T09:47:00.000Z	umop-apisdn	Some_Person	which unallocated space?
2007-07-26T09:48:00.000Z	Some_Person	umop-apisdn	the only one i have: http://img409.imageshack.us/img409/9576/gp2gg6.png
2007-07-26T09:48:00.000Z	umop-apisdn		ah, i see... your ext3 partition is after the unallocated space
2007-07-26T09:48:00.000Z	Some_Person	umop-apisdn	correct
2007-07-26T09:48:00.000Z	umop-apisdn		if it were before, you could probably make it work
2007-07-26T09:49:00.000Z	Some_Person	umop-apisdn	what can i do about it?
2007-07-26T09:49:00.000Z	umop-apisdn		well, right offhand, i would be inclined to say "nothing"
2007-07-26T09:50:00.000Z	umop-apisdn	Some_Person	if you don't want to buy another drive, and you don't want to lose the install you have, then i would suggest purchasing a commercial drive partitioning software, like partition magic... except i don't know if partition magic is still around
2007-07-26T09:50:00.000Z	Some_Person	umop-apisdn	so i'm stuck with less than half a gig of free space on my ext3 partition?
2007-07-26T09:50:00.000Z	Some_Person	umop-apisdn	I am not buying another drive
2007-07-26T09:50:00.000Z	Some_Person	umop-apisdn	i have partition magic on windows
2007-07-26T09:51:00.000Z	umop-apisdn	Some_Person	then the only thing i can suggest is blowing away your install, and being more careful when you reinstall next time :)
2007-07-26T09:51:00.000Z	Some_Person	umop-apisdn	should i try that?
2007-07-26T09:51:00.000Z	umop-apisdn	Some_Person	aha! yes, that may do the trick
2007-07-26T09:51:00.000Z	Some_Person	umop-apisdn	ok, i'll try partition magic
