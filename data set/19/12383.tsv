2008-01-15T09:36:00.000Z	firefoxIE		hey in Synaptic, the latest version of the program they list isn't actually the latest, is this normal?
2008-01-15T09:36:00.000Z	firefoxIE		for example they dont even have Pidgin instead of Gaim
2008-01-15T09:36:00.000Z	Flannel	firefoxIE	You're still in feisty, aren't you
2008-01-15T09:37:00.000Z	Flannel	firefoxIE	Yes.  That's normal.  Each version of Ubuntu has frozen versions of software (besides bugfixes)
2008-01-15T09:38:00.000Z	Flannel	firefoxIE	You can upgrade via the internet.  Don't use a CD.  It'll save you on bandwidth too
2008-01-15T09:42:00.000Z	Flannel	firefoxIE	Feisty will only ever have the stuff it was released with.  You should upgrade to gutsy if you want the newer stuff.
2008-01-15T09:42:00.000Z	Flannel	firefoxIE	Thats the easiest and most hassle free method.
2008-01-15T09:44:00.000Z	Flannel	firefoxIE	You can.  But you should use package management.  Its easier and friendlier during upgrades.
2008-01-15T09:46:00.000Z	Flannel	firefoxIE	You don't want to do it that way.  You should just upgrade to gutsy.
2008-01-15T09:47:00.000Z	Flannel	firefoxIE	"Latest" in that sense means latest in the repositories.  Which is different than latest released ever.
2008-01-15T09:48:00.000Z	Flannel	firefoxIE	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GutsyUpgrades  Follow that, upgrde to gutsy
2008-01-15T09:52:00.000Z	Flannel	firefoxIE	because you need to have update-manager up to date to do the gutsy upgrade
2008-01-15T09:53:00.000Z	Flannel	firefoxIE	Theyre different, they suit different needs
2008-01-15T13:42:00.000Z	Flannel	firefoxIE	Check out edubuntu.org, they've got a pretty informative site
2008-01-15T13:46:00.000Z	Flannel	firefoxIE	No, thats wrong.  Theyre both just as capable.  Edubuntu can install as a regular system, or as the LTSP/thin-client thing.
2008-01-15T14:00:00.000Z	Flannel	firefoxIE	no
2008-01-15T14:00:00.000Z	Flannel	firefoxIE	Instead of being mouse point/click its keyboard arrow point/click
2008-01-15T14:01:00.000Z	Flannel	firefoxIE	nope.  Its just menus that are text based
2008-01-15T14:01:00.000Z	Flannel	firefoxIE	The questions are essentially the same
