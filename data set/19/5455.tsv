2008-06-27T07:30:00.000Z	Storrgi1		can i launch he Gui installer
2008-06-27T07:30:00.000Z	Storrgi1		i dont think thats my issue
2008-06-27T07:30:00.000Z	Storrgi1		i have a machine that has 6 drives in it, most of them used by windows
2008-06-27T07:31:00.000Z	Storrgi1		i want to install ubuntu to my raptor drive
2008-06-27T07:31:00.000Z	Storrgi1		but i have windows on a partion on that drive
2008-06-27T07:31:00.000Z	Storrgi1		the rest is raw
2008-06-27T07:32:00.000Z	Storrgi1		is it because I have windows on my primary drive?

2008-06-27T07:33:00.000Z	Storrgi1		should I boot to windows and try the installer?
2008-06-27T07:35:00.000Z	poseidon	Storrgi1	all you really need to know is what partitions you need to make.  Keep in mind that you don't need a /home partition (I don't use it), nor do you need a swap partition if you have a descent amount of ram.
2008-06-27T07:37:00.000Z	poseidon	Storrgi1	You really don't need the /home partition.
2008-06-27T07:45:00.000Z	poseidon	Storrgi1	no you don't need a swap partition
2008-06-27T07:46:00.000Z	poseidon	Storrgi1	You should be able to.  All you need is a / partition.  A /home partition will just back up your /home/ directory (ie music files etc) which you can manually back up do a cd or something (saves room)
2008-06-27T07:47:00.000Z	poseidon	Storrgi1	also make sure you choose primary partition.
2008-06-27T07:48:00.000Z	poseidon	Storrgi1	it will ask you somewhere in the set up.  It will auto detect windows and set up everything for you. ;)
2008-06-27T07:50:00.000Z	Storrgi1	poseidon	I installed vista on a 50GB partion.... I have a 71GB raptor
2008-06-27T07:51:00.000Z	poseidon	Storrgi1	ok.  The defualt partitioner for the installer doesn't always work well when shrinking windows.
2008-06-27T07:58:00.000Z	poseidon	Storrgi1	lol, it's not hard is it?  When I started linux I tried about 6 different distros alongside windows in one day (installed then all so I could see how they would natively work on my hardware).
