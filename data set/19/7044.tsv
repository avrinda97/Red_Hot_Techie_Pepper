2007-10-19T23:29:00.000Z	zerokill		hi, i think i completely screwed up my pc via grub anybody care to help me out?
2007-10-19T23:29:00.000Z	[chr0n0s]	zerokill	a liitle more explainiation
2007-10-19T23:31:00.000Z	zerokill	[chr0n0s]	ive got a 2 sata2 harddrive setup. hda had vista and hdb was supposed to be the ubuntu one. after i made the partitions in hdb i installed grub in the mbr of hda (hd0)
2007-10-19T23:32:00.000Z	zerokill		after the 1st boot grub hungs with an error 22 and after  couple of tried with error 17
2007-10-19T23:32:00.000Z	[chr0n0s]	zerokill	and ... now ?
2007-10-19T23:32:00.000Z	zerokill		what i did was to change the sata2 cables and make hda hdb and vise versa
2007-10-19T23:32:00.000Z	zerokill		installed again and all is ok for ubuntu
2007-10-19T23:33:00.000Z	zerokill		but the mbr of hdb (now containing vista)
2007-10-19T23:33:00.000Z	zerokill		has a broken grub
2007-10-19T23:33:00.000Z	zerokill		hence i cant load vista
2007-10-19T23:33:00.000Z	zerokill		2 questions
2007-10-19T23:33:00.000Z	[chr0n0s]	zerokill	do you have vista DVD/CD ?
2007-10-19T23:33:00.000Z	zerokill		can i restore vista mbr in hdb ? and if i do that will vista load ok after i manualy changed its mapping?
2007-10-19T23:34:00.000Z	zerokill		i have it but i cant load recovery console cause it doesnt recognise my password
2007-10-19T23:35:00.000Z	[chr0n0s]	zerokill	put the HDD's back the way they were, fix mbr, then reinstall grub
2007-10-19T23:35:00.000Z	zerokill		i cant cause i found out that the grub problem i had was because i didnt install grub in the linux mbr
2007-10-19T23:36:00.000Z	zerokill		it just hungs if i use that setup
2007-10-19T23:37:00.000Z	zerokill		does this make any sense? grub asking for my primary hd to be a linux native?
2007-10-19T23:38:00.000Z	[chr0n0s]	zerokill	nope..
