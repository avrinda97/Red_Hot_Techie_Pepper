2011-08-08T05:58:00.000Z	diamonds		does anyone actually use empathy?
2011-08-08T05:58:00.000Z	diamonds		I'm using it to get the ootb ubuntu experience...
2011-08-08T05:58:00.000Z	ejv	diamonds	i use pidgin
2011-08-08T05:59:00.000Z	ejv		pidgin + pidgin-otr > *
2011-08-08T05:59:00.000Z	diamonds		pidgin less than ideal for irc, imo
2011-08-08T06:00:00.000Z	ejv		that's what xchat and irssi are for
2011-08-08T06:00:00.000Z	diamonds		yeah
2011-08-08T06:00:00.000Z	ejv		take your pick ;)

2011-08-08T06:00:00.000Z	diamonds		irssi was a bit... complex
2011-08-08T06:00:00.000Z	diamonds		but I should probably give it another go
2011-08-08T06:00:00.000Z	ejv	diamonds	you won't regret the time invested in memorizing the keybinds
2011-08-08T06:01:00.000Z	diamonds		do they integrate with the desktop notification system?
2011-08-08T06:01:00.000Z	diamonds		on mac this was always an issue...
2011-08-08T06:01:00.000Z	ejv	diamonds	yes there is an irrsi libnotify integration, just google
2011-08-08T06:01:00.000Z	diamonds	ejv	ty
