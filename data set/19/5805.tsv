2009-07-20T15:52:00.000Z	Adlai		I installed wicd, it doesn't see the wireless networks, and now I want to get network-manager back.

2009-07-20T15:55:00.000Z	Adlai		network-manager worked fine, shit only broke now that I tried to use wicd.
2009-07-20T15:55:00.000Z	iMatter	Adlai	did you go into wicd preferences, and make sure it has the right device
2009-07-20T15:56:00.000Z	iMatter	Adlai	go to wicd, press preferences and tell me the wifi device
2009-07-20T15:56:00.000Z	Adlai	iMatter	I'm in fucking WinXP b/c I have no internet on my Ubuntu boot.

2009-07-20T15:57:00.000Z	iMatter	Adlai	well when you get to ubuntu go to wicd, press perferences and see what it says under Wi-Fi interface
2009-07-20T15:57:00.000Z	Adlai	iMatter	how do I "go to wicd"?
