2012-09-19T06:59:00.000Z	dandaman1	ActionParsnip	i'm on 10.04 lts :\ will it still work?
2012-09-19T07:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dandaman1	yes but the old libs and such make it harder to work with, should be a similar method
2012-09-19T07:07:00.000Z	dandaman1	ActionParsnip	didn't help for the external sd card :\
2012-09-19T07:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dandaman1	try the gksudo nautilus $HOME    see if you get write access. Sounds like you haven't been unplugging the device correctly
2012-09-19T07:11:00.000Z	dandaman1	ActionParsnip	not sure what that's supposed to do
2012-09-19T07:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dandaman1	when you unplug the phine, do you use the safetly remove option?
2012-09-19T07:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dandaman1	or do you just rip it out?
2012-09-19T07:15:00.000Z	dandaman1	ActionParsnip	i just rip it out, there is no safety remove option on the phone itself
