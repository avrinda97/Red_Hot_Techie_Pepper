2008-11-23T14:27:00.000Z	facefaceface		I am following the instructions about wireless networks in the docs, but I have a problem - Network Manager isn't on my panel
2008-11-23T14:27:00.000Z	facefaceface		hi ValentineXX
2008-11-23T14:28:00.000Z	facefaceface		https://help.ubuntu.com/7.10/internet/C/wireless.html
2008-11-23T14:28:00.000Z	facefaceface		https://help.ubuntu.com/7.10/internet/C/wireless-connecting.html
2008-11-23T14:29:00.000Z	facefaceface		quote "In the Taskbar click the Network Manager icon." ... no icon here
2008-11-23T14:29:00.000Z	facefaceface		!tollerance
2008-11-23T14:30:00.000Z	facefaceface		so I fail at step 1 of 'connecting to a wifi'
2008-11-23T14:30:00.000Z	timob	facefaceface	 you can go system->admin->network
2008-11-23T14:30:00.000Z	facefaceface		(although I am connected)
2008-11-23T14:30:00.000Z	facefaceface	timob	yeh
2008-11-23T14:30:00.000Z	facefaceface		yeah
2008-11-23T14:30:00.000Z	facefaceface		that works
2008-11-23T14:30:00.000Z	facefaceface		but I would like to use NM
2008-11-23T14:31:00.000Z	timob	facefaceface	that is network manager
2008-11-23T14:31:00.000Z	facefaceface		and I can't find it, although it is apparently installed
2008-11-23T14:31:00.000Z	facefaceface	timob	oh...
2008-11-23T14:31:00.000Z	timob		its the configuration for it
2008-11-23T14:32:00.000Z	facefaceface	timob	what is the name of the app that manages what happens when I plug in a cable?
