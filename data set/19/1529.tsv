2011-02-21T05:43:00.000Z	bustedup277		i have no idea what that is
2011-02-21T05:44:00.000Z	bustedup277		perhaps i should let it load a little longer this time

2011-02-21T05:45:00.000Z	bradg	bustedup277	Okay. It may not. I just remember it taking 5 or 6 minutes to finally move forward when I installed.

2011-02-21T06:24:00.000Z	bradg	bustedup277	Is it possible to install from a different medium? When I tried installing 10.10 (64-bit) on my laptop with a CD-R it failed and gave a weird error that I can't recall. There were a few complicated fixes, but the easiest solution was to just use a DVD instead. Just a thought. Otherwise I got nothing. :-/
