2012-01-16T17:15:00.000Z	glebihan	wdp	the openoffice package in ubuntu is only a transitional package used to replace openoffice with libreoffice when openoffice was previously installed. openoffice is no longer supported on ubuntu

2012-01-16T17:16:00.000Z	glebihan	wdp	why ? they're the same ?
2012-01-16T17:16:00.000Z	wdp	glebihan	if they're the same, why name them differently?
2012-01-16T17:16:00.000Z	glebihan	wdp	political issues, which lead to the fork
2012-01-16T17:17:00.000Z	wdp	glebihan	if its a fork, they're not the same.
