2005-04-29T09:18:00.000Z	Raskall		*sigh* I'm up at 5am to bake bread for my family. Am  I a good "housewife", or what?
2005-04-29T05:55:00.000Z	Raskall		Agh... I wish I had some startup capital. There are so many small domain-/hosting-/mail-providers I am already running a better service than. I just need a server with decent storage system, backup system and a line I am allowed to sell services on.
2005-04-29T05:55:00.000Z	Shufla	Raskall	and insurance, when someone sues you.
2005-04-29T05:56:00.000Z	Raskall	Shufla	of course. :) But that will my business manager (also called wife) handle.
2005-04-29T05:58:00.000Z	Shufla	Raskall	if you feel that it's safer...
2005-04-29T06:00:00.000Z	Raskall	Shufla	just for practical reasons, really. or for old habits.
2005-04-29T06:00:00.000Z	Shufla	Raskall	i feel more comfortable(? good) with sudo and sudo -s -H when I do need 0uid shell
2005-04-29T06:00:00.000Z	Shufla	Raskall	imagine situation:
2005-04-29T06:01:00.000Z	Raskall	Shufla	ok. It's just about habits, I guess. Why would sudo be safer than becoming root?
2005-04-29T06:03:00.000Z	Raskall	Shufla	just if you havent typed the su password the last 30 minutes.
2005-04-29T06:04:00.000Z	Shufla	Raskall	well. with unpriviliged account you have to type `sudo' before # commands. and that the time when i think second time.
2005-04-29T06:05:00.000Z	Shufla	Raskall	afair it's possibile to change that time to 0. than anytime you need go superuser you need to use password. and when you need longer superuser work, you go into sudo -s -H
2005-04-29T06:05:00.000Z	Raskall	Shufla	hmm. ok. But still. I have ben god^H^H^Hroot for >15 years and never had any accidents, so the habit is bad to break.
2005-04-29T06:06:00.000Z	Shufla	Raskall	ah. i'm much younger than you :>
2005-04-29T06:06:00.000Z	Raskall	Shufla	:) Yup. and learn more easily, I guess.
2005-04-29T06:07:00.000Z	Shufla	Raskall	no. less habits, that's it. but i think that sudo-like typing should be used for newbies in ubuntu as more supported.
2005-04-29T06:08:00.000Z	Raskall	Shufla	mm.. I love the way it is done in ubuntu. Newbies are less prone to accidents that way. So when I help people, I tro to remember "sudo" before the commands I tell them to run.
2005-04-29T06:10:00.000Z	Shufla	Raskall	and one less password to remember...
2005-04-29T06:11:00.000Z	Raskall	Shufla	of course. But I have always figured you cannot get enought passwords.
