2006-11-10T17:27:00.000Z	sobersabre		then I did the same with xubuntu-desktop
2006-11-10T17:28:00.000Z	sobersabre		then the boot image was gray
2006-11-10T17:28:00.000Z	sobersabre		I want the boot image to be brown again.
2006-11-10T17:28:00.000Z	sobersabre		how do I achieve this ?
2006-11-10T17:28:00.000Z	sobersabre		torpor fdisk ?
2006-11-10T17:29:00.000Z	sobersabre		torpor r do you mean the 'logical volume manager' ?
2006-11-10T17:29:00.000Z	sobersabre		torpor there's gparted - a partition editor with GUI
2006-11-10T17:29:00.000Z	sobersabre		it also allows to format the partitions you create with it
2006-11-10T17:30:00.000Z	sobersabre		torpor apt-get install gparted
2006-11-10T17:30:00.000Z	cge	sobersabre	Hah, you're just like me. You come here with a question, and no one answers, but you get pulled into answering other people :)
2006-11-10T17:30:00.000Z	sobersabre	cge	I don't know if I am like you... are you a good thing to be alike ?
2006-11-10T17:30:00.000Z	sobersabre		:)
2006-11-10T17:31:00.000Z	sobersabre		torpor paypal, donate ... duh
2006-11-10T17:31:00.000Z	sobersabre		:)
2006-11-10T17:31:00.000Z	sobersabre		hmm... he gave me no  choice to explain it is a joke.
2006-11-10T17:31:00.000Z	cge	sobersabre	Well, it isn't a very good way to be, because you're questions usually don't get answered, and you end up spending too much time helping people here. But as for you second question, you want to run "sudo update-alternatives --config usplash-artwork.so"
2006-11-10T17:32:00.000Z	cge	sobersabre	Err, your there. As you can see, I've been here too long.
2006-11-10T17:32:00.000Z	sobersabre	cge	... I am surely am
