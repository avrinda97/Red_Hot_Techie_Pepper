2010-03-05T03:53:00.000Z	datz		Hi, I was wondering if I don't update for awhile, and their are multiple kernel updates in that time, will I be able to update to the latest one, or will I have to update to each missed one in order?
2010-03-05T03:55:00.000Z	chili555	datz	skipping is perfectly fine
2010-03-05T03:59:00.000Z	chili555	datz	skipping is generally OK, but there may be some differences in the way config files are handled, they should work pretty well
2010-03-05T04:00:00.000Z	datz	chili555	I am talking about kernel updates. Is that what you were referring to?
2010-03-05T04:00:00.000Z	chili555	datz	yes, indeed
2010-03-05T04:01:00.000Z	datz	chili555	great. :) I realized that apt-get upgrade doesn't update the kernel when there are updates released, and I'd rather keep my system up... just was wondering what would happen when kernel updates pile up. ;)
2010-03-05T04:02:00.000Z	chili555	datz	it doesn't? it has for me
2010-03-05T04:02:00.000Z	datz	chili555	it didn't last time I checked.
2010-03-05T04:03:00.000Z	datz	chili555	looking at the update log, almost looks like it does though..
2010-03-05T04:03:00.000Z	chili555	datz	how did you determine it didnt? apt-get didnt and Update Mnger did?
2010-03-05T04:04:00.000Z	chili555	datz	did you run apt-get update first and then upgrade?
2010-03-05T04:04:00.000Z	datz	chili555	well I ran apt-get upgrade once before, and when I got to the GUI, I noticed that there were only kernel updates availiable, so I figured it skipped them. but maybe their were quickly more kernel updates in that time period.
2010-03-05T04:05:00.000Z	datz	chili555	yes, I ran update first
2010-03-05T04:05:00.000Z	chili555	datz	the apt routine _should_ be identical to Update Mgr, AFAIK
2010-03-05T04:06:00.000Z	datz	chili555	ok, thanks. I wasn't sure about that
2010-03-05T04:06:00.000Z	chili555	datz	sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
2010-03-05T04:07:00.000Z	chili555	datz	not beyond minor config changes, but those are usually quite minor and easy to fix
2010-03-05T04:08:00.000Z	datz	chili555	ok. I guess it is probably better to restart the system after kernel updates anyway...
2010-03-05T04:08:00.000Z	chili555	datz	i agree
