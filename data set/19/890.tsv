2011-11-15T07:43:00.000Z	abraxas_		you won't believe what's happening.  I don't believe what's happening... my gnome-terminal (11.10, gnome-3) is mysteriously PICKING up hotkeys... suddenly backspace===paste... yesterday, c===new window ...it's making no sense to me, right now...anyone have a clue?
2011-11-15T07:44:00.000Z	elz89	abraxas_	you got cracked...
2011-11-15T07:44:00.000Z	abraxas_	elz89	This happened to me while I was troubleshooting wifi. that is, zero access, fresh install
2011-11-15T07:45:00.000Z	elz89	abraxas_	you on a laptop?
2011-11-15T07:45:00.000Z	abraxas_		yep
2011-11-15T07:45:00.000Z	abraxas_	elz89	yep, that is
2011-11-15T07:45:00.000Z	elz89	abraxas_	tried a usb keyboad?
2011-11-15T07:45:00.000Z	abraxas_	elz89	nope... not yet...however, the hotkeys are actually getting set... I will be mid-sentence and "C" becomes the hotkey for "New Window"... to thep oint that it's in the file menu, and I have to go into the prefs and reset it
2011-11-15T07:46:00.000Z	abraxas_		not sure if it happens mid-line...just know about it when I next hit "c"
2011-11-15T07:46:00.000Z	elz89	abraxas_	sorry I still don;t get all these random hotkey issues people seem to have...
2011-11-15T07:46:00.000Z	abraxas_	elz89	and if it helps, it's happening approximately once every 4-6 hours of work
2011-11-15T07:47:00.000Z	abraxas_	elz89	so this is common?  I'm happy to try to figure out more and present it...I've been using gnome-terminal for the last, oh, 5 years...but this is sudden and really bizarre... can you point me to a ticket or issue?
2011-11-15T07:47:00.000Z	abraxas_	elz89	I got nothing through the wisdom of google
2011-11-15T07:48:00.000Z	elz89	abraxas_	like I say, try an external keyboard first just to be sure, a random pube may be crossing tracks on the keyboard :-P
2011-11-15T07:48:00.000Z	abraxas_	elz89	What confuses me, more than a random pube, is that I wasn't aware that any hotkey exists that SETS hotkeys... When I click the "Edit" button in gnome-terminal and see "BACKSPACE" next to paste, I cannot imagine how it got set within the last 60 seconds
2011-11-15T07:49:00.000Z	elz89	abraxas_	google is useless to about 99% of people who do not know how to use it properly..
2011-11-15T07:49:00.000Z	abraxas_	elz89	so far, the only suggestion you made that would otherwise make sense is that someone dropped a trojan on me and is evil enough to JUST be playing around with my gnome-term while I work in it...
2011-11-15T07:50:00.000Z	abraxas_	elz89	but if you can point me to an official issue/ticket, I'll be happy to continue my search from there
2011-11-15T07:50:00.000Z	elz89	abraxas_	sorry I have never seen or heard of such an outlandish issue, maybe try the external keyboard like I said...
