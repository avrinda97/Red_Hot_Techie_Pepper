2010-09-17T11:18:00.000Z	RealOpty		anyone know how to program a button on my mouse to operate my music player rhythmbox ?
2010-09-17T11:20:00.000Z	NoTownKasper	RealOpty	I forget the exact program name, but playdeb.net and probably getdeb.net have a program called omnijoy or something very similar which allows you to configure all sorts of mouse/joystick/controller functions for just that sort of issue. So there's an option. I use my logitect controller as a remote for VLC and Rhythmbox. :P
2010-09-17T11:22:00.000Z	RealOpty	NoTownKasper	thanks. ill look that up. that reminds me.
2010-09-17T11:23:00.000Z	RealOpty	NoTownKasper	how do you get your remote to work with rhythmbox? i know about enabling the plugin lirc, but did you have to config anything?
2010-09-17T11:25:00.000Z	NoTownKasper	RealOpty	It's been a few weeks I'd have to look back at the specifics and it's not on this machine, it's on my laptop, but yeah, I used the program to bluff the gamepad buttons into mimicing the same commands on my media keyboard.
2010-09-17T11:26:00.000Z	NoTownKasper	RealOpty	So if the command for my media keyboard was something like MKBplay for the play button, that's what I set the 'x' button on my controller to send when Rhythmbox is in the forefront. Make sense?
2010-09-17T11:48:00.000Z	RealOpty	NoTownKasper	yeah what about rhythmbox though. I have a remote and such, i want to use lirc
2010-09-17T11:50:00.000Z	NoTownKasper	RealOpty	Honestly, I don't remember how I configured it...but it will require some configuring and playing around with the program I mentioned.
2010-09-17T11:51:00.000Z	NoTownKasper	RealOpty	And I think the controller/mouse needs to be hardwired into the system for omnijoy or whatever it's called to work...if you have a real remove, I can't help ya.

2010-09-17T12:00:00.000Z	NoTownKasper	RealOpty	You said you wanted to use your remote with Rhythmbox right? Well, that same thread had a fix for making a remote work with Rhythmbox using lirc.
2010-09-17T12:01:00.000Z	RealOpty	NoTownKasper	lol i know that. i was just pointing it out, i found the answer to my question.
