2008-05-16T17:03:00.000Z	pinnerup		A question: I'm on HH. When I use irssi regularly, I can easily use ALT+arrow keys to change windows (right-left), but when I ssh to a shell and try the same, ALT+arrow keys just gives me "3D" and "3C". Any idea how to fix that? (Note: When I use PuTTY to ssh from Windows to the same shell, it works fine.)
2008-05-16T17:04:00.000Z	ikonia	pinnerup	there your terminal emmulation
2008-05-16T17:04:00.000Z	ikonia	pinnerup	alt+arrow is not a standard key sequence
2008-05-16T17:05:00.000Z	pinnerup	ikonia	Ehm ... ok. But how do I fix it?
2008-05-16T17:05:00.000Z	ikonia	pinnerup	echo $TERM look at your term time
2008-05-16T17:06:00.000Z	pinnerup	ikonia	"echo $term" doesn't return anything.
2008-05-16T17:06:00.000Z	ikonia	pinnerup	echo $TERM
2008-05-16T17:06:00.000Z	pinnerup	ikonia	It returns "xterm".
2008-05-16T17:06:00.000Z	ikonia	pinnerup	Hmmm what is the terminal your using
2008-05-16T17:07:00.000Z	ikonia	pinnerup	thats odd,
2008-05-16T17:08:00.000Z	ikonia	pinnerup	when you do echo $TERM is that on your local machine or the machine your ssh'd into
2008-05-16T17:08:00.000Z	pinnerup	ikonia	Tried on both - they both give "xterm".
2008-05-16T17:08:00.000Z	ikonia	pinnerup	that should be "ok"
2008-05-16T17:08:00.000Z	ikonia	pinnerup	what ssh client are you using
2008-05-16T17:09:00.000Z	pinnerup	ikonia	The standard in HH. It's just called "ssh", I guess.
2008-05-16T17:09:00.000Z	ikonia	pinnerup	yup, all should be fine
2008-05-16T17:09:00.000Z	ikonia	pinnerup	what is the remote box your sshing to, ubuntu ?
2008-05-16T17:10:00.000Z	pinnerup	ikonia	Debian.
2008-05-16T17:10:00.000Z	ikonia	pinnerup	let me see if I have a debian sysstem I can access to check the term types
