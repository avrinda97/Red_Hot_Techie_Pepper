2009-12-25T15:34:00.000Z	digitalchemist	X-Sleepy-X	that won't work ... he's in a live session trying to repair his gnome-panel configuration files
2009-12-25T15:35:00.000Z	digitalchemist	X-Sleepy-X	he's mounted his harddrive and is supposedly somewhere close to /media/the_disk/home/his_name/.gconf
2009-12-25T15:41:00.000Z	X-Sleepy-X	digitalchemist	it might be easier to guide him without the live session?
2009-12-25T15:41:00.000Z	digitalchemist	X-Sleepy-X	I think he can't log into his regular install   :-)
2009-12-25T15:41:00.000Z	X-Sleepy-X	digitalchemist	not even with ctrl+alt+f1?
2009-12-25T15:42:00.000Z	X-Sleepy-X	digitalchemist	to get the cli
2009-12-25T15:42:00.000Z	digitalchemist	X-Sleepy-X	I think it's graphical that gives the problem. I'm trying to disable gnome-panel from loading ... either that or deleting gnome-panel's configuration files ... but the gconf files don't seem to have content, and I'm not sure what gconf-editor is using as its backend
2009-12-25T15:43:00.000Z	digitalchemist	X-Sleepy-X	that'd probably work. then he could use gconf-tool2 to alter the key ...  it's that or trying to chroot from the live session
2009-12-25T15:43:00.000Z	X-Sleepy-X	digitalchemist	:)
2009-12-25T15:54:00.000Z	digitalchemist	X-Sleepy-X	thanks for fielding those other questions   :-)
2009-12-25T15:54:00.000Z	X-Sleepy-X	digitalchemist	:)
2009-12-25T15:57:00.000Z	digitalchemist	X-Sleepy-X	that looks really cool. never heard of it before  :-D
2009-12-25T15:57:00.000Z	X-Sleepy-X	digitalchemist	it's nice, formerly called elisa
2009-12-25T15:58:00.000Z	digitalchemist	X-Sleepy-X	ah, that project looked like it had some promise. and this appears to be Python stuff, so that add some cool points
2009-12-25T15:58:00.000Z	X-Sleepy-X	digitalchemist	Yeah, they recently release v.1.0
2009-12-25T15:58:00.000Z	X-Sleepy-X	digitalchemist	movvida i mean.
2009-12-25T16:04:00.000Z	digitalchemist	X-Sleepy-X	ShazbotMcNasty: I'm not an apt expert, but there's got to be a command to check the version of installed packages ... this seems to be what (s)he wants
2009-12-25T16:04:00.000Z	X-Sleepy-X	digitalchemist	there is, but i cant seem to remember at the moment
