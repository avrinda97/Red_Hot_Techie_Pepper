2007-04-19T16:00:00.000Z	tecta		anyone know where i can get a .deb file of realplayer
2007-04-19T16:00:00.000Z	TheVault	tecta	Go to Realone.com and they got a easy step by step on how to setup. Its super easy
2007-04-19T16:00:00.000Z	tecta	TheVault	thanks
2007-04-19T16:01:00.000Z	TheVault	tecta	Yup. Download the file, then to a+x filenamehere.bin
2007-04-20T16:01:00.000Z	TheVault	tecta	Do that in the terminal.
2007-04-20T16:04:00.000Z	tecta	TheVault	for some reason it wont play the audio just the video
2007-04-20T16:04:00.000Z	tecta	TheVault	no sound when playing video is what i mean
2007-04-20T16:05:00.000Z	TheVault	tecta	Do you have the Mp3 codecs installed?
2007-04-20T16:05:00.000Z	tecta	TheVault	just for gstreamer
2007-04-20T16:06:00.000Z	TheVault	tecta	Is the file you trying to play corrupt?
2007-04-20T16:06:00.000Z	tecta	TheVault	no
2007-04-20T16:06:00.000Z	TheVault	tecta	Hmmm, what format is the video?
2007-04-20T16:06:00.000Z	tecta	TheVault	realplayer
2007-04-20T16:07:00.000Z	TheVault	tecta	Hmmm, it should be playing. Do you have volume down accidently. I had my volume up on my speaker, but not the computer
2007-04-20T16:07:00.000Z	tecta	TheVault	no i can play music
2007-04-20T16:09:00.000Z	TheVault	tecta	Hmmm thats very strange. I donno what else the problem can be. Sometimes I get good luck playing the videos in differ media players. VLC player is what I use the most, but I don't recall it playing realone files
2007-04-20T16:11:00.000Z	TheVault	tecta	Wish I could help more, but I gave all suggestions that I know of. Another test would be is to download another Realone type file and try playing it in realone media player to make sure its not just the file you orginally downloaded may be corrupt, even though it don't seem like it
2007-04-20T16:11:00.000Z	tecta	TheVault	i have like 40 rm files cant get sound out of any
2007-04-20T16:11:00.000Z	TheVault	tecta	Very very odd
