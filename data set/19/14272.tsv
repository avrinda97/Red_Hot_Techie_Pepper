2004-12-17T13:22:00.000Z	sn0n		howdy all
2004-12-17T13:22:00.000Z	sn0n		this is honestly the best live CD i've used
2004-12-17T13:23:00.000Z	sn0n		(but im still an Arch user)  :-p
2004-12-17T13:23:00.000Z	sn0n		not quite convinced   ;-)
2004-12-17T13:23:00.000Z	sn0n		there are a few problems
2004-12-17T13:23:00.000Z	sn0n		1) lack of a GOOD gtk ftp client
2004-12-17T13:24:00.000Z	|trey|	sn0n	Arch kinda sucked last I tried it... most software is out of date... and it made me do too much to get a working system  :
2004-12-17T13:25:00.000Z	|trey|	sn0n	lftp  :/
2004-12-17T13:25:00.000Z	|trey|	sn0n	no one gives a fuck about Windoze...
2004-12-17T13:27:00.000Z	|trey|	sn0n	I have yet to find another good use for them  :/
2004-12-17T13:32:00.000Z	|trey|	sn0n	I already told you, no one gives a fuck about winblows.
2004-12-17T13:33:00.000Z	|trey|	sn0n	then fix it... but shut up either way.
2004-12-17T13:34:00.000Z	|trey|	sn0n	seriously dude, if they don't run with wine at least, you need to shut up about these apps  :/
2004-12-17T13:35:00.000Z	|trey|	sn0n	they provide source code? great, get them to port to Windows...
2004-12-17T13:36:00.000Z	|trey|	sn0n	get them to make a Linux port... we don't care  :/
2004-12-17T13:37:00.000Z	|trey|	sn0n	true enough I guess... cept this is #ubuntu... so there is everything wrong with you talking about it here...
2004-12-17T13:38:00.000Z	|trey|	sn0n	you did... now you can leave... thanks
2004-12-17T13:47:00.000Z	|trey|	sn0n	trolling = annoying and repetitious discussion that no one wants to read.
2004-12-17T13:49:00.000Z	|trey|	sn0n	who said pay?  I don't pay for software... but I don't steal it either...
