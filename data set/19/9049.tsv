2007-03-05T11:04:00.000Z	ikonia	kenthomson_	two quick questions. 1.) are you using berly out of the ubuntu repo's (or the suggest ubuntu repo's) 2.) what drivers are you using
2007-03-05T11:05:00.000Z	kenthomson_	ikonia	1) i am using beryl from "deb http://ubuntu.beryl-project.org/ edgy main". 2) I am using the latest nvidia drivers from its website (installed though "envy")
2007-03-05T11:06:00.000Z	ikonia	kenthomson_	ok - so you fine on the beryl version, what as the reason for not using the ubuntu supported nvidia drivers ?
2007-03-05T11:07:00.000Z	kenthomson_	ikonia	i wanted the latest nvidia drivers (stable) so i do it from their website. they are a sane company and wouldn't release any beta-buggy stuff as final-release drivers, besides i wanted the latest stuff and so had to bypass the lethargic packaging team at ubuntu's repos, besides ubuntu can't support proprietary stuff, so its not an ussye
2007-03-05T11:08:00.000Z	ikonia	kenthomson_	thats not quite what I was asking. Why did you want the latest nvidia drivers, and you're a little out of understanding on the support issue
2007-03-05T11:09:00.000Z	kenthomson_	ikonia	because later versions = stabler versions + effecient harware management, besides they are not buggy-stable as they are final release drivers from a reputable company
2007-03-05T11:10:00.000Z	ikonia	kenthomson_	ok - so there was no real reason. The reason I say your out of understanding ont he support option, is because not all drivers are compatible with all kernel and glibc versions, which can cause unusual effects, which is why ubuntu packages certain versions that have no compatability issues
2007-03-05T11:10:00.000Z	ikonia	kenthomson_	just as an FYI for you
2007-03-05T11:10:00.000Z	kenthomson_	ikonia	so you mean to say the later nvidia drivers may be causing this?
2007-03-05T11:10:00.000Z	ikonia	kenthomson_	possibly
2007-03-05T11:11:00.000Z	ikonia	kenthomson_	just giving you food for thought
2007-03-05T11:11:00.000Z	ikonia	kenthomson_	its not always about latest = better, compatability and supportability
2007-03-05T11:11:00.000Z	kenthomson_	ikonia	but i noticed observable performance boost while running beryl+kiba-dock when i upgraded from ubuntu's nvidia drivers to nvidia's official latest drivers, and i would like to have that. besides i don't think nvidia would release a driver without thinking about having its negative effect on the worlds largest-growing most-used newbie-intensive distro
2007-03-05T11:12:00.000Z	ikonia	kenthomson_	I disagree, the nvidia drivers are built genericly and its up to the distro to move around them (mostly)
2007-03-05T11:12:00.000Z	kenthomson_	ikonia	so you suggest downgrading the drivers? :(
2007-03-05T11:13:00.000Z	ikonia	kenthomson_	well moving to a supported platform is often the easy way to debug problems and get ideas, then once its fixed you can always look at upgrading
2007-03-05T11:17:00.000Z	kenthomson_	ikonia	globe thanks! i will have to do some more research on this issue
