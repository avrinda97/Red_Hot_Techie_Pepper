2005-08-10T09:19:00.000Z	traveller		does firestarter stop the firewall when i exit it?
2005-08-10T09:21:00.000Z	traveller		so iptables and the firestarter rules would still continue to run even if firestarter is not?
2005-08-10T09:23:00.000Z	rob_p	traveller	 Yes.  All Firestarter does is load a bunch of packet filtering rules/policies into the kernel.  Unless you specifically have it remove them, they will stay intact.
2005-08-10T09:26:00.000Z	traveller	rob_p	thanks
2005-08-10T09:29:00.000Z	rob_p	traveller	 No problem.  By the way, in case you are interested in a firewall alternative that is designed to automatically load at boot time, and is designed for Ubuntu, you can get it here: http://rob.pectol.com/content/view/27/1/
2005-08-10T09:30:00.000Z	traveller	rob_p	i'll check it out
2005-08-10T09:31:00.000Z	rob_p	traveller	   Let me know what you think.  It's been through several revs now and I believe it to be a good firewall solution for Ubuntu.
2005-08-10T09:32:00.000Z	traveller	rob_p	the page doesn't seem to be loading
2005-08-10T09:33:00.000Z	rob_p	traveller	 that's odd!  let me double-check the URL...
2005-08-10T09:34:00.000Z	traveller	rob_p	i think it's firestarter, i stopped it and the page loads
2005-08-10T09:34:00.000Z	rob_p	traveller	 Ok... whew!  I was worried for a minute :)
2005-08-10T09:35:00.000Z	traveller	rob_p	it's odd that firestarter would block it
2005-08-10T09:35:00.000Z	rob_p	traveller	 Yeah, that is odd!
2005-08-10T09:36:00.000Z	traveller	rob_p	it seems that the block was triggered by a traceroute from the server
2005-08-10T09:36:00.000Z	rob_p	traveller	 triggered by what?
2005-08-10T09:37:00.000Z	traveller	rob_p	a traceroute, it is logged by firestarter in events
2005-08-10T09:38:00.000Z	rob_p	traveller	 as in a traceroute being done from my server to you?
2005-08-10T09:38:00.000Z	traveller	rob_p	that's what it says on the log
2005-08-10T09:39:00.000Z	rob_p	traveller	 I do have a Web-based traceroute utility on my website... but what are the chances...  hrm...
