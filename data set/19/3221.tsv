2009-11-21T15:12:00.000Z	mikeyfbi		im on a dell inspiron with the intel 945GM graphics card and just upgraded to 9.10 and can't get flash to play nice, or smooth scroll FF, or even smooth drag windows
2009-11-21T15:12:00.000Z	mikeyfbi		this has happened everytime i upgrade fresh since 8.something but i can't for the life of me remember how i fixed it
2009-11-21T15:13:00.000Z	mikeyfbi		i already tried reverting the driver
2009-11-21T15:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip29	mikeyfbi	tried renaming /home/$USER/.mozilla  and rerunning FF?
2009-11-21T15:13:00.000Z	mikeyfbi	ActionParsnip29	not just a FF issue :(
2009-11-21T15:14:00.000Z	mikeyfbi	ActionParsnip29	also with dragging windows, and i can't enable desktop effects (i dont want too, but it's the telltale sign i've always got)
2009-11-21T15:15:00.000Z	mikeyfbi	ActionParsnip29	but i'll try that to see if it fixes the flash
2009-11-21T15:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip29	mikeyfbi	try removing the driver, then reinstall it. reboot in between so you are using vesa driver
2009-11-21T15:15:00.000Z	mikeyfbi	ActionParsnip29	ok will do ... do you also have the intel chip?  or just experience? ;)
2009-11-21T15:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip29	mikeyfbi	i hate intel chips, it just makes sense to me
2009-11-21T15:17:00.000Z	mikeyfbi	ActionParsnip29	wow!  that worked to fix the flash issue!!
2009-11-21T15:17:00.000Z	mikeyfbi	ActionParsnip29	why does that work?
2009-11-21T15:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip29	mikeyfbi	removes the settings for the driver, then gives you defaults.
2009-11-21T15:18:00.000Z	mikeyfbi	ActionParsnip29	default video driver?  or default flash plugin
2009-11-21T15:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip29	mikeyfbi	default settings for the video driver
2009-11-21T15:19:00.000Z	mikeyfbi	ActionParsnip29	so when would it have changed from 'default' ... ?  isn't default 'default' for a reason?
2009-11-21T15:20:00.000Z	mikeyfbi	ActionParsnip29	lol, srry for the questions, but i like to try and understand instead of just do :)
2009-11-21T15:21:00.000Z	mikeyfbi	ActionParsnip29	ok well i'll try the driver thing ... hey do you have paypal?  i'd like to buy you a 'beer' for your help because this has been driving me nuts
2009-11-21T15:26:00.000Z	mikeyfbi	ActionParsnip29	still here?
