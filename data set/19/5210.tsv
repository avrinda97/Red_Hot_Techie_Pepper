2010-08-08T15:38:00.000Z	rooks	guntbert	 in which repository gm-notify is placed?
2010-08-08T15:38:00.000Z	rooks	guntbert	that is what i asked
2010-08-08T15:39:00.000Z	rooks	guntbert	since i have it installed on my lappy bunt i dont have a clue how i did it :P
2010-08-08T15:39:00.000Z	guntbert	rooks	yes, but there is no package gm-notify, so it cannot be in any repo, I misinterpreted then...
2010-08-08T15:39:00.000Z	guntbert	rooks	or do you mean gmail-notify?
2010-08-08T15:40:00.000Z	rooks	guntbert	i think i have this https://launchpad.net/gm-notify running
2010-08-08T15:40:00.000Z	guntbert		!info gmail-notify | rooks
2010-08-08T15:41:00.000Z	rooks	guntbert	how does it relate to gm-notify?
2010-08-08T15:42:00.000Z	guntbert	rooks	because its a "Highly Ubuntu integrated GMail Notifier" ? might be the very same
2010-08-08T15:43:00.000Z	rooks	guntbert	i have this https://launchpad.net/gm-notify running, not any other, so i dont knwo, are you sure its the same package?
2010-08-08T15:44:00.000Z	guntbert	rooks	no, I am not, if you have exactly this running then its probably from *this* ppa :-)
2010-08-08T15:45:00.000Z	rooks	guntbert	i guess , meh, i should keep notice of installing one-off packages
2010-08-08T15:45:00.000Z	rooks		:)
2010-08-08T15:46:00.000Z	guntbert	rooks	:-)
