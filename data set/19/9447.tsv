2007-01-10T08:53:00.000Z	CyberCod		I went into my media folder, and one of the subfolders "TV Shows" had a double.. Two folders named "TV Shows".  One had everything in it... and the other had nothing.   Well, I sent the empty one to trash.  But somehow it deleted it completely instead.  And when i looked back in my media folder, both were gone.  I had deleted all my shows.  My freespace showed that they were gone as I suddenly had like 40GB more space than I had moments before.  N
2007-01-10T08:55:00.000Z	CyberCod		is there perhaps an undelete command?
2007-01-10T08:56:00.000Z	CyberCod		Bummer
2007-01-10T08:56:00.000Z	CyberCod		she had like 140GB of shows (a real tv head)

2007-01-10T09:19:00.000Z	Jordan_U	CyberCod	You can move their .desktop files to another folder, the files are in /usr/share/applications/screensavers on Edgy
2008-07-19T10:42:00.000Z	Jordan_U	CyberCod	What problem are you having?
2008-07-19T10:43:00.000Z	Jordan_U	CyberCod	Can you pastebin the script?
2008-07-19T10:45:00.000Z	Jordan_U	CyberCod	If superfirelord42 is right you could try adding "export DISPLAY=:0.0" to the script and see if that gets it to work ( though hard coding :0.0 may fail if you use fast user switching )
2008-07-19T10:47:00.000Z	Jordan_U	CyberCod	That should be #!/bin/sh ( I assume you just missed that pasting but mention it just in case )
2008-07-19T10:48:00.000Z	Jordan_U	CyberCod	Or rather, if you want it to run in bash you should use #!/bin/bash :)
2008-07-19T10:53:00.000Z	Jordan_U	CyberCod	either do "DISPLAY=:0.0 command" on one line or "export DISPLAY=:0.0 <newline> command"
2008-07-19T10:57:00.000Z	Jordan_U	CyberCod	Try redirecting stderr to your log file so you can see what is going wrong
2008-07-19T10:57:00.000Z	Jordan_U	CyberCod	"command 2> /path/to/file"
2008-07-19T10:58:00.000Z	Jordan_U	CyberCod	Using just ">" will just get you regular output, not errors
2008-07-19T11:08:00.000Z	Jordan_U	CyberCod	"DISPLAY:0.0 command"
2008-07-19T11:08:00.000Z	Jordan_U	CyberCod	Forgot the "=" :)
2008-07-19T11:09:00.000Z	Jordan_U	CyberCod	"DISPLAY=:0.0 command" :)
2008-07-19T11:34:00.000Z	Jordan_U	CyberCod	Open a terminal and "echo $DISPLAY"
