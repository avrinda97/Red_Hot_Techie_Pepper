2005-07-16T10:29:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Sonderblade	sounds like a gnome thing more than a Ubuntu thing
2005-07-16T11:41:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Sonderblade	erm... dev packages are needed for compiling
2005-07-16T11:42:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Sonderblade	you shouldn't need to manually install stuff, and I suggest you look into the apt-get build-dep command if you must
2005-07-16T11:43:00.000Z	Sonderblade	thoreauputic	sometimes that's not possible
2005-07-16T11:44:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Sonderblade	well, if you are compiling you need to read the apt howto and see how apt can make your life easier for dev packages
2005-07-16T11:45:00.000Z	Sonderblade	thoreauputic	but i thought ubuntu was user friendly
2005-07-16T11:45:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Sonderblade	it is - compiling isn't something most users need to do
2005-07-16T11:46:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Sonderblade	usually we find people compiling things that are already available anyway, but they haven't looked in the right places
2005-07-16T11:47:00.000Z	Sonderblade	thoreauputic	you shouldn't need to look in the right places
2005-07-16T11:47:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Sonderblade	what are you trying to compile?
2005-07-16T11:48:00.000Z	Sonderblade	thoreauputic	anjuta
2005-07-16T11:48:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Sonderblade	and that's a silly statement - even in Windows you have to know where to look
2005-07-16T11:48:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Sonderblade	anjuta is avsailable in synaptic
2005-07-16T11:49:00.000Z	Sonderblade	thoreauputic	i know but not the latest version
2005-07-16T11:49:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Sonderblade	if you are using anjuta I wpuld think you would know how to compile in Linux, no?
2005-07-16T11:50:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Sonderblade	it *is* a development app, is it not?
2005-07-16T11:50:00.000Z	Sonderblade	thoreauputic	i know how to compile, it is just that in some distros you don't have to go through the pains of -dev packages to do it
2005-07-16T11:52:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Sonderblade	that's why I mentioned apt-get build-dep. There is also auto-apt and a whole lot of other goodies you haven't learnt about, apparently - apt-get install apt-howto would be a good start :)
