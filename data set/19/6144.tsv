2009-05-22T19:37:00.000Z	heogen	felix_	amule
2009-05-22T19:38:00.000Z	heogen	felix_	im not under the proxy
2009-05-22T19:38:00.000Z	felix_	heogen	i think there was an option to change the port you use and check if it works. in emule it was
2009-05-22T19:38:00.000Z	heogen	felix_	but i did update
2009-05-22T19:39:00.000Z	heogen		and what port i'll write
2009-05-22T19:39:00.000Z	felix_	heogen	one you have open and works
2009-05-22T19:40:00.000Z	heogen		may you say me an example?
2009-05-22T19:41:00.000Z	felix_	heogen	i dunno
2009-05-22T19:41:00.000Z	felix_		try 80 its http port
2009-05-22T19:41:00.000Z	felix_		surely its open
