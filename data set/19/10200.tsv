2008-11-11T23:57:00.000Z	lorenzosu		Hi N1X0N
2008-11-11T23:58:00.000Z	lorenzosu		I upgraded from ubuntu studio 8.04 to 8.10 and system was broken. Tried completely removing ubuntu studio, then re-installing. But when I boot in the rt I get no wifi. Any clue?
2008-11-11T23:58:00.000Z	lorenzosu		"normal" kernel works fine now
2008-11-11T23:58:00.000Z	Taza	lorenzosu	The upgrade process from 8.04 to 8.10 seems to break a lot of systems.
2008-11-11T23:59:00.000Z	Taza	lorenzosu	And the problems somehow don't appear in fresh installs, at the very least mostly
2008-11-11T23:59:00.000Z	Taza	lorenzosu	I've just worked some 12 hours restoring my machine. You're not alone in that sentiment
2008-11-11T23:59:00.000Z	Taza	lorenzosu	Back everything up, wipe HDD of everything Ubuntu, fresh install.
2008-11-12T00:00:00.000Z	Taza	lorenzosu	Usually /home and /etc
2008-11-12T00:00:00.000Z	Taza	lorenzosu	Though you can't directly restore /etc or otherwise you'll re-break your system
2008-11-12T00:01:00.000Z	Taza	lorenzosu	If you did it as an user, /home
2008-11-12T00:01:00.000Z	Taza	lorenzosu	Backing up everything /home is a good idea anyway
2008-11-12T00:02:00.000Z	Taza	lorenzosu	Probably /home/lorenzosu/.software
2008-11-12T00:02:00.000Z	Taza	lorenzosu	"File System" from places, there's a directory called "home"
2008-11-12T00:03:00.000Z	Taza	lorenzosu	Usually but not always
2008-11-12T00:03:00.000Z	Taza	lorenzosu	Usually I migrate file-by-file. Firefox's data folder is always safe.
2008-11-12T00:04:00.000Z	Taza	lorenzosu	That's why people use Fedora. :P
2008-11-12T00:04:00.000Z	Taza	lorenzosu	Ubuntu isn't always that stable - everytime you upgrade you risk getting everything broken
2008-11-12T00:05:00.000Z	Taza	lorenzosu	Not necessarily. Sometimes.
