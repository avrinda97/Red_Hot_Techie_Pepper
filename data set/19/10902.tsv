2007-06-28T13:37:00.000Z	ferronica		can i use KDE applications on GNOME ?
2007-06-28T13:37:00.000Z	pike_	ferronica	yeah
2007-06-28T13:38:00.000Z	pike_	ferronica	no it will pull down some kde libs but it does that automatically. most people use k3b for instance to burn cds
2007-09-25T11:16:00.000Z	pike_	ferronica	you want to dual boot xp and ubuntu or install xp and run it virtually inside ubuntu?
2007-09-25T11:18:00.000Z	pike_	ferronica	it is very easy but keep in mind xp will overwrite the mbr so youll need to fix that with livecd after install. 1) boot to livecd and use gparted to resize and free up disk space 2) install xp to free space 3) recover mbr
2007-09-25T11:18:00.000Z	pike_	ferronica	unless you need xp for gaming id install and run virtually

2007-10-23T21:43:00.000Z	pike_	ferronica	lighter. i dont need openoffice or anything and i just dont like all the redundancy of gnome though this is getting better i hear
2007-10-23T21:44:00.000Z	ferronica	pike_	there is abi word in xfce ?
2007-10-23T21:44:00.000Z	pike_	ferronica	yes default is abi instead of open office
