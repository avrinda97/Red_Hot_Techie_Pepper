2004-11-02T12:06:00.000Z	ulisse		Someone can help me with updates?
2004-11-02T12:07:00.000Z	ulisse		Yes, it relaods the packing lists, but I think the operation is too fast
2004-11-02T12:07:00.000Z	ulisse		as if the list is already up to date...
2004-11-02T12:08:00.000Z	stvn	ulisse	if you reloaded it already today, it will be fast, there are not /that/ many updates that you'll see changes within a day
2004-11-02T12:14:00.000Z	stvn	ulisse	did it ever work?
2004-11-02T12:19:00.000Z	stvn	ulisse	you don't remember what was updated just before it stopped working, do you?
2004-11-02T12:21:00.000Z	stvn	ulisse	you might want to try to add pci=noacpi but not nolapic
2004-11-02T12:22:00.000Z	stvn	ulisse	have no idea
2004-11-02T12:23:00.000Z	stvn	ulisse	it disable local apic (still no idea what that means though)
2004-11-02T12:25:00.000Z	stvn	ulisse	hm, not sure really, I've had quite some problems with apm and acpi but couldn't really find the logic in when it worked or not
2004-11-02T12:25:00.000Z	stvn	ulisse	so I'd suggest try some different setups, sorry that I can't help you better
2005-01-19T09:13:00.000Z	stvn	ulisse	same here
2005-01-19T09:13:00.000Z	ulisse	stvn	I'm not alone!
2005-01-19T09:14:00.000Z	ulisse	stvn	let's try to track down a method to reproduce
2005-01-19T09:15:00.000Z	stvn	ulisse	basically if the window is not focussed, window list doesn't respond the first time
2005-01-19T09:22:00.000Z	stvn	ulisse	do you also have focus follows mouse enabled?
2005-01-19T09:22:00.000Z	ulisse	stvn	no, i can try...
2005-01-19T09:25:00.000Z	ulisse	stvn	focus follow mouse seems not to work on my machine...
2005-01-19T09:25:00.000Z	stvn	ulisse	seb128 : if i move 'n click fast, it works if not it doesn't
