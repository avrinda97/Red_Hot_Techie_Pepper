2010-07-16T03:47:00.000Z	Mahjongg		what utility gives this output on console login? 0 packages can be updated.
2010-07-16T03:47:00.000Z	Mahjongg		0 updates are security updates.
2010-07-16T03:49:00.000Z	VCoolio	Mahjongg	update-manager probably, it's some python script it runs from /usr/lib/update-manager I believe, I modified it once
2010-07-16T03:50:00.000Z	Mahjongg	VCoolio	how can I get my application to run next to that output?
2010-07-16T03:53:00.000Z	VCoolio	Mahjongg	it's a file 'apt_check.py', run that like 'python /path/to/apt_check.py --help' to get the options
2010-07-16T03:55:00.000Z	VCoolio	Mahjongg	it's part of update-notifier, by default in startup applications
2010-07-16T03:56:00.000Z	VCoolio	Mahjongg	python /usr/lib/update-notifier/apt_check.py --help
2010-07-16T03:58:00.000Z	Mahjongg	VCoolio	sorry, I couldn't make myself clear, I'd like to my app to the autorun script that is run everytime a console sheel is opened just like the apt-check.py applicaiton. But I do not know which autostart script file that might be
2010-07-16T04:00:00.000Z	VCoolio	Mahjongg	you mean you want it when you open a terminal? Add the command to ~/.bashrc then
2010-07-16T04:00:00.000Z	Mahjongg	VCoolio	but it should run for any user
2010-07-16T04:01:00.000Z	Mahjongg		just like apt_check.py
2010-07-16T04:02:00.000Z	VCoolio	Mahjongg	you can put unverisal startup scripts in /etc/xdg/autostart
2010-07-16T04:02:00.000Z	VCoolio	Mahjongg	automatically run after login that is, in .desktop format
2010-07-16T04:03:00.000Z	Mahjongg	VCoolio	is apt_check.py run that way too?
2010-07-16T04:06:00.000Z	VCoolio	Mahjongg	you can create a .desktop file that does that, put the command on the Exec= line and use a notification bubble or something: notify-send "Updates" "$(python ../../apt_check.py --human-readable)"
2010-07-16T04:07:00.000Z	Mahjongg	VCoolio	I think /etc/xdg/autostart is only run when a gdm session is open
2010-07-16T04:07:00.000Z	Mahjongg	VCoolio	that would not help me
2010-07-16T04:07:00.000Z	Mahjongg	VCoolio	thanks anyways for your help
2010-07-16T04:08:00.000Z	VCoolio	Mahjongg	ok
