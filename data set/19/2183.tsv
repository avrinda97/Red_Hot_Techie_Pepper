2010-06-03T23:08:00.000Z	ZvB		i tried to run a program but it gets killed after a few secs, terminal: "Killed"
2010-06-03T23:08:00.000Z	ZvB		can someone give me a hint what the problem could be?
2010-06-03T23:09:00.000Z	rocket16	ZvB	Are all dependencies satisfied?
2010-06-03T23:09:00.000Z	rocket16		Cam: His used the word "Camp" which contained "cam" your nick, so you got highlghited
2010-06-03T23:10:00.000Z	ZvB	rocket16	do you mean libs? yes
2010-06-03T23:10:00.000Z	rocket16	ZvB	Well, is there any message been displayed in Terminal?
2010-06-03T23:11:00.000Z	ZvB	rocket16	just "Killed"
2010-06-03T23:11:00.000Z	ZvB	rocket16	normal output and than Killed
2010-06-03T23:14:00.000Z	rocket16	ZvB	Is your System swapping? The memory usage, if high, can cause the Kernel to kill some-processes
2010-06-03T23:15:00.000Z	ZvB	rocket16	ill reboot and try it again, thanks for the tip!
2010-06-03T23:15:00.000Z	rocket16	ZvB	My pleasure,  :)
2010-06-03T23:21:00.000Z	ZvB	rocket16	thanks obvs you were right, now ive got a segfault :D
2010-06-03T23:22:00.000Z	rocket16	ZvB	I see, the process is trying to access the memory which it is not allowed to access, :(
2010-06-03T23:23:00.000Z	ZvB	rocket16	yes ik, we've to find out how to solve that now :S
2010-06-03T23:25:00.000Z	rocket16	ZvB	Are you sure the process is safe? Sometimes bachtracing works in that way,
2010-06-03T23:27:00.000Z	ZvB	rocket16	what do you mean 'safe'?
2010-06-03T23:28:00.000Z	rocket16	ZvB	I mean, sometimes such processes might intrude into System resources,so is that process from a trusted source?
2010-06-03T23:28:00.000Z	ZvB	rocket16	its a project of our own :D
2010-06-03T23:29:00.000Z	rocket16	ZvB	I see. :) Then it is ok,
