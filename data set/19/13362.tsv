2005-04-30T11:00:00.000Z	FR500	itay	 in the multimiedia systems selector, try the different sound pipelines, for games most lilely requiere alsa or oss, if they dont work you need to fix them first
2005-04-30T11:01:00.000Z	FR500	itay	 did you tried what i said?
2005-04-30T11:02:00.000Z	FR500	itay	 i never used kde
2005-04-30T11:04:00.000Z	FR500	itay	 yo need to be sure that alsa and oss work
2005-04-30T11:10:00.000Z	itay	FR500	I think alsa works fine, cause I can hear sounds, I think the problem is just with Midis
2005-04-30T11:10:00.000Z	FR500	itay	 how do you know if the prog is using alsa?
2005-04-30T11:11:00.000Z	itay	FR500	no
2005-04-30T11:13:00.000Z	FR500	itay	 dunno man, zero problems with ubuntu and sound here
