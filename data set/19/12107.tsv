2006-02-22T15:37:00.000Z	Kerrian		um, hate to be a bother, but I don't think it worked
2006-02-22T15:37:00.000Z	Kerrian		I followed the directionx exactly
2006-02-22T15:37:00.000Z	mustard5	Kerrian	did you sudo nvidia-config enable?
2006-02-22T15:39:00.000Z	mustard5	Kerrian	try what dooglus said above
2006-02-22T15:39:00.000Z	mustard5	Kerrian	yep
2006-02-22T15:41:00.000Z	mustard5	Kerrian	try doing it again I would say
2006-02-22T15:42:00.000Z	mustard5	Kerrian	you might need the legacy drivers ..I'm not sure..its a pretty old card isnt it?
2006-02-22T15:44:00.000Z	mustard5	Kerrian	well its still go sudo password, but it usually remembers your password being entered for a time period
2006-02-22T15:46:00.000Z	mustard5	Kerrian	thats good then :)
2006-02-22T15:46:00.000Z	mustard5	Kerrian	its working
2006-02-22T15:47:00.000Z	mustard5	Kerrian	I would install nvidia-settings
2006-02-22T15:47:00.000Z	mustard5	Kerrian	that should allow you to play with brightness/contrast/gamma and would confirm
2006-02-22T15:48:00.000Z	mustard5	Kerrian	the splash screen is pretty good confirmation though
2006-02-22T15:48:00.000Z	mustard5	Kerrian	k...type nvidia-settings in terminal then to run it
2006-02-22T15:49:00.000Z	mustard5	Kerrian	well done :)  not too many hiccups with that one then
2006-02-22T15:50:00.000Z	mustard5	Kerrian	I can only imagine... :)
2006-02-22T15:50:00.000Z	mustard5	Kerrian	I've only been on linux since June last year...Ubuntu is my first distro
2006-02-22T15:52:00.000Z	mustard5	Kerrian	a lot of stuff is covered in the Ubuntu Starter Guide in your help menu...under 'System'
2006-02-22T15:53:00.000Z	mustard5	Kerrian	I've still got win98se installed for windows games
