2008-12-07T13:25:00.000Z	rom1v		impossible to install sun-java6-plugin
2008-12-07T13:26:00.000Z	rom1v		"no version of sun-java6-plugin packet is available, but it exists in database
2008-12-07T13:26:00.000Z	rom1v		"
2008-12-07T13:28:00.000Z	rom1v		this packet doesn't appear in synaptic
2008-12-07T13:28:00.000Z	rom1v		while one month ago, it worked
2008-12-07T13:29:00.000Z	Flannel	rom1v	Please pastebin the output to: sudo apt-get update
2008-12-07T13:34:00.000Z	rom1v	Flannel	here is the result of sudo apt-get update :
2008-12-07T13:35:00.000Z	Flannel	rom1v	Yes, use the ubuntu pastebin
2008-12-07T13:36:00.000Z	Flannel	rom1v	use paste.ubuntu.com
2008-12-07T13:37:00.000Z	Flannel	rom1v	You really should disable -proposed.  That could very well be the problem
2008-12-07T13:39:00.000Z	rom1v	Flannel	I disabled it, no changes :(
2008-12-07T13:39:00.000Z	Flannel	rom1v	Did you do sudo apt-get update after changing?
2008-12-07T13:41:00.000Z	Flannel	rom1v	alright, please pastebin: apt-cache policy sun-java6-plugin && sudo apt-get install sun-java6-plugin
2008-12-07T13:43:00.000Z	Flannel	rom1v	Odd.  Alright, let me manually check the french mirror.
2008-12-07T13:45:00.000Z	rom1v	Flannel	I use 64bits
2008-12-07T13:45:00.000Z	Flannel	rom1v	It shouldn't be, but I'll check
2008-12-07T13:48:00.000Z	Flannel	rom1v	Oh... interesting.  It does seem that -plugin is missing from amd64... let me check other mirrors
2008-12-07T13:48:00.000Z	Flannel	rom1v	Looks like -plugin doesn't exist on AMD64, which... is odd, to say the least.
