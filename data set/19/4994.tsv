2008-10-20T23:59:00.000Z	Strife89		Woah! I tried changing my resolution from 1024x768 to 800x600, then I tried to activate Desktop Effects (the latter failed). I had to download an NVidia Legacy Driver and reboot; now I can't change my resolution back.
2008-10-21T00:00:00.000Z	Strife89		The graphics card is a RIVA TNT2, if I'm not mistaken. Can anyone suggest a way to upsize my resolution again?
2008-10-21T00:00:00.000Z	csilk	Strife89	 isn't an old card?
2008-10-21T00:01:00.000Z	Strife89	csilk	Truth be told, *all* of my hardware is old. :)
2008-10-21T00:01:00.000Z	csilk	Strife89	oh tire, do you have the grfx driver installed?
2008-10-21T00:02:00.000Z	Strife89	csilk	I believe that installing the (restricted) driver is that cause of the problem.
2008-10-21T00:04:00.000Z	csilk	Strife89	yeah that's a pretty handy menu ;)
2008-10-21T00:05:00.000Z	Strife89	csilk	I've been using Ubuntu for a while, so I was looking for "Restricted Drivers" insted.
2008-10-21T00:06:00.000Z	csilk	Strife89	 that menu was removed and merged with "hardware drivers" in last version :)
2008-10-21T00:06:00.000Z	Strife89	csilk	So I noticed. :)
2008-10-21T00:06:00.000Z	Strife89	csilk	Rebooting now, let's hope it works.
2008-10-21T00:18:00.000Z	Strife89	csilk	Thanks for the pointer. :)
2008-10-21T00:19:00.000Z	csilk	Strife89	 did uninstalling work?
2008-10-21T00:20:00.000Z	Strife89	csilk	Yep; I'm back in the joy of 1024x768. :D
2008-10-21T00:20:00.000Z	Strife89	csilk	My monitor was made in 1997. Go figure. :)
2008-10-21T00:21:00.000Z	Strife89	csilk	My graphics card? 1999.
2008-10-21T00:21:00.000Z	Strife89	csilk	I mean, c'mon. Every time I open the case, I swear I smell rotting wood. ;)
2008-10-21T00:26:00.000Z	Strife89	csilk	Have some spare time? Treat yourself: http://strife89.deviantart.com/gallery
2008-10-21T00:28:00.000Z	Strife89	csilk	Thank you. :)
