2007-09-24T07:35:00.000Z	Emperor886		Does anyone here know how to reset the Xorg.conf file from the command line after it has been backed up then changed?
2007-09-24T07:35:00.000Z	jrib	Emperor886	sudo cp /path/to/your/old/xorg.conf /path/to/your/new/xorg.conf
2007-09-24T07:36:00.000Z	Emperor886	jrib	I dont know the path's, I screwed up my Xorg.conf file and I can only get the command line when I boot Ubuntu now. I am using Puppylinux now.
2007-09-24T07:36:00.000Z	jrib	Emperor886	so you don't know where the backup is?
2007-09-24T07:37:00.000Z	Emperor886	jrib	It is backed up in the default place that Ubuntu would back it up in, but I have no idea where that is.
2007-09-24T07:37:00.000Z	jrib	Emperor886	what did you use?  dpkg-reconfigure?
2007-09-24T07:38:00.000Z	Emperor886	jrib	I gave the command 'sudo nvidia-glx-new enable' figuring that would render better, and Ubuntu automatically made a backup of my Xorg.conf file.
2007-09-24T07:39:00.000Z	jrib	Emperor886	you do this 'cd /etc/X11'.  Then list what you see with 'ls'.  Then look for the backup (will be xorg.conf.blahblahblah or similar).  Then 'cp xorg.conf.blahblahblah xorg.conf'
2007-09-24T07:41:00.000Z	Emperor886	jrib	Thanks, will be back if it doesn't work.
2007-09-24T07:49:00.000Z	Emperor886	jrib	There was no xorg.conf.blahblahblah file. =/
2007-09-24T07:49:00.000Z	jrib	Emperor886	what was there?
2007-09-24T07:51:00.000Z	Emperor886	jrib	X, Xserver, xorg.conf, display-session-options, and some other stuff, but nothing to do with the .conf file.
2007-09-24T07:53:00.000Z	jrib	Emperor886	I don't know then.  You'll have to try reading the documentation for the nvidia driver or consult google to see where it creates the backup.  Better approach: just make a new one with 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg'
2007-09-24T07:54:00.000Z	jrib	Emperor886	or 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg' for less questions
2007-09-24T07:55:00.000Z	Emperor886	jrib	As in y/n questions?
2007-09-24T07:56:00.000Z	jrib	Emperor886	not quite, it will ask you for the driver you want to use
2007-09-24T07:57:00.000Z	Emperor886	jrib	I don't know the driver I want to use though, I've only been using Linux for a month.**
2007-09-24T07:57:00.000Z	jrib	Emperor886	nv is the normal one for nvidia cards (not proprietary)
2007-09-24T07:58:00.000Z	Emperor886	jrib	Thanks, will be back.
