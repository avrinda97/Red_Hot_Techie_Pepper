2007-12-07T08:24:00.000Z	DM|	skar	use the vmware uninstal script
2007-12-07T08:25:00.000Z	skar	DM|	how do i do that? i think the kernels were installed when i installed the vmware server
2007-12-07T08:25:00.000Z	skar	DM|	from synaptic
2007-12-07T08:26:00.000Z	DM|	skar	look in /usr/bin, should be named "vmware-uninstall" or similar
2007-12-07T08:26:00.000Z	DM|	skar	will have a .pl after it
2007-12-07T08:26:00.000Z	skar	DM|	ah thanks, i'll check it out
2007-12-07T08:27:00.000Z	skar	DM|	i can't find anything with vmware in /usr/bin

2007-12-07T08:27:00.000Z	skar	DM|	k
2007-12-07T08:28:00.000Z	DM|	skar	try this in a terminal  "sudo apt-get remove vmware-player --purge" should go through stopping the services
2007-12-07T08:29:00.000Z	DM|		vmnet is a service, vmmon is the kernel module
2007-12-07T08:30:00.000Z	DM|		dont ask to ask a question, just ask it
2007-12-07T08:30:00.000Z	skar	DM|	ah, i think it might work now..one sec
