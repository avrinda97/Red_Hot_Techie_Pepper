2012-03-10T21:30:00.000Z	victor__		I downloaded the latest nvidia drivers for my gfx and linux 64bit. I checked the permission tab on the file to be able to run as a program. However I have to run it as root, how do I do that via GUI?
2012-03-10T21:30:00.000Z	victor__		Or via line...
2012-03-10T21:31:00.000Z	victor__		I dont understand, I just installed ubuntu fresh and I never picked a root password, how am I supposed to login as root to install the nvidia.run package?
2012-03-10T21:32:00.000Z	victor__		su ./file ?
2012-03-10T21:32:00.000Z	victor__		"You appear to be running an Xserver, please exit X before installing"
2012-03-10T21:32:00.000Z	victor__		What does that mean? :P
2012-03-10T21:33:00.000Z	victor__		Successfully ran it with the sudo command now and that prompted
2012-03-10T21:34:00.000Z	victor__		 " ERROR: You appear to be running an X server; please exit X before
2012-03-10T21:34:00.000Z	victor__		         installing." when running sudo ./file
2012-03-10T21:34:00.000Z	victor__		is X the GUI?
