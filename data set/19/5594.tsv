2008-05-31T06:14:00.000Z	Leefmc		Question: Long story short, i installed Ubuntu Desktop from an ISO, but did not get any install options such as Partitioning, anyone know why?
2008-05-31T06:14:00.000Z	JoshJ	Leefmc	you probably picked one of the options that didn't allow for partitioning
2008-05-31T06:22:00.000Z	JoshJ	Leefmc	if UNetBootIn is similar to the normal disc, that's exactly what you have to do
2008-05-31T06:23:00.000Z	Leefmc	JoshJ	K
2008-05-31T06:27:00.000Z	JoshJ	Leefmc	that would be this channel

2008-05-31T06:27:00.000Z	Leefmc	JoshJ	ty
2008-05-31T06:27:00.000Z	Leefmc	JoshJ	I didn't want to annoy this channel with stupid usage questions hehe :)
2008-05-31T06:27:00.000Z	JoshJ	Leefmc	also, linuxcommand.org is great for linux newbies in general
2008-05-31T06:28:00.000Z	JoshJ	Leefmc	linuxcommand.org is a basic (and advanced) command line tutorial that's good at teaching you the real power of linux
2008-05-31T06:28:00.000Z	Leefmc	JoshJ	Noted, thankyou
2008-05-31T06:29:00.000Z	JoshJ	Leefmc	gimme a sec, i had a list a minute ago
2008-05-31T06:30:00.000Z	JoshJ	Leefmc	definitely.
2008-05-31T06:30:00.000Z	JoshJ	Leefmc	also you can look at sites like this: http://www.linuxrsp.ru/win-lin-soft/table-eng.html and http://www.linuxalt.com/
2008-05-31T06:31:00.000Z	Leefmc	JoshJ	Since were on the subject, last night from ubuntu i was going through some flash tuts on basics. One of which was the basic ubuntu repository (linux/whatever) for installed programs. How is this maintained? Are there many "dead" or "not well written" programs in that list?
2008-05-31T06:31:00.000Z	JoshJ	Leefmc	note that while those sites list programs, you really should install them from the package manager if you can rather than downloading/compiling them yourself
2008-05-31T06:32:00.000Z	Leefmc	JoshJ	Yea, i think the package manager is what the tut was talking about, iirc
2008-05-31T06:32:00.000Z	JoshJ	Leefmc	the few dead programs are mostly in "universe"; the main stuff is all actively maintained
2008-05-31T06:33:00.000Z	JoshJ	Leefmc	also, "universe" programs are not necessarily reviewed by the Ubuntu people so they are more likely to be lower quality or just plain viewed as "un-essential" for some reason
