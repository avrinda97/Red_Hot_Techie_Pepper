2010-02-16T19:00:00.000Z	wacek		hey, why can't I remove Firefox from Ubuntu?
2010-02-16T19:01:00.000Z	wacek		I do, I can't remove it through the software center thingy though. There's no remove button, only update.
2010-02-16T19:01:00.000Z	wacek		Removing through sudo indeed does work though. Isn't that just weird?
2010-02-16T19:02:00.000Z	wacek		How does the control center determine when you can remove apps then?
2010-02-16T19:02:00.000Z	wacek		I know Linux.
2010-02-16T19:03:00.000Z	wacek		My point is, there's no "Remove" button in Firefox list item, but there is one for eg. X-Chat. Why so?
2010-02-16T19:03:00.000Z	wacek		I know Linux.
2010-02-16T19:03:00.000Z	indus	wacek	the software center is not finished
2010-02-16T19:04:00.000Z	wacek	indus	oh, I see. :) Thanks!
2010-02-16T19:04:00.000Z	indus	wacek	also i believe firefox is integral to ubuntu and so maybe software center doesnt allow
2010-02-16T19:04:00.000Z	wacek	indus	yeah, I thought so, but apt-get remove works fine and doesn't delete any more apps.
2010-02-16T19:04:00.000Z	indus	wacek	but frankly avoid it till 10,04 comes out, i cant see either install or remove button sometimes
2010-02-16T19:05:00.000Z	wacek	indus	oh, okay, I thought they should have released it by now. This is my first Ubuntu after like a year.
2010-02-16T19:05:00.000Z	indus	wacek	released what
2010-02-16T19:05:00.000Z	wacek	indus	the new app-store like control center
2010-02-16T19:05:00.000Z	indus	wacek	yes the store might come in with 10,04 i think for now its just install .remove
2010-02-16T19:06:00.000Z	indus	wacek	 had that issue
2010-02-16T19:07:00.000Z	wacek	indus	Ubuntu store? Like what could you buy there?
2010-02-16T19:07:00.000Z	indus	wacek	you could buy stuff from 10,04 is what i hear
