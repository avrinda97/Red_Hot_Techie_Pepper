2006-03-22T07:34:00.000Z	kingspawn		i thought build-essential installed the linker for you? gcc seems to be present before you install b-e
2006-03-22T07:34:00.000Z	gnomefreak	kingspawn	open synaptic and search for gcc
2006-03-22T07:35:00.000Z	kingspawn	gnomefreak	you can just tell me :) im a work, which means winXP
2006-03-22T07:35:00.000Z	gnomefreak	kingspawn	gcc is not installed by default some gcc apps are but the package gcc is not
2006-03-22T07:36:00.000Z	kingspawn	gnomefreak	okay, i see. i tried to compile something on a fresh ubuntu-install, but gcc reported "cant build executable files" - which led me to believe that gcc was there, but not the linker
2006-03-22T07:49:00.000Z	kingspawn	gnomefreak	http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-source.html has information about build-essential. it does not in any way contain gcc, it simply instructs the system which programs/packages are needed to compile, link, etc.
2006-03-22T07:53:00.000Z	kingspawn	gnomefreak	prolly just me that misunderstood. sorry about that. a good page to read through anyhow.
2006-03-22T07:54:00.000Z	gnomefreak	kingspawn	i am reading it
2006-03-27T16:27:00.000Z	gnomefreak	kingspawn	you mean dpkg -l
2006-03-27T16:27:00.000Z	kingspawn	gnomefreak	perhaps i do :)
2006-04-13T16:50:00.000Z	kingspawn	gnomefreak	now we are getting philosophical
2006-04-13T16:50:00.000Z	gnomefreak	kingspawn	no what one person doesnt know another might
2006-04-13T16:50:00.000Z	kingspawn	gnomefreak	still, that does not pertain to the definition of a question
2006-04-27T15:50:00.000Z	gnomefreak	kingspawn	does wav not stand for windows audio video anymore?
2006-04-27T15:52:00.000Z	kingspawn	gnomefreak	heh, yes, but it again is encoded in PCM, but I was trying to kind of abbreviate the level of information
2006-04-27T15:52:00.000Z	gnomefreak	kingspawn	ah
2006-05-03T05:43:00.000Z	kingspawn	gnomefreak	just did...
2006-05-03T05:43:00.000Z	kingspawn	gnomefreak	no prob, he needs another run of it, heh
2006-05-18T05:27:00.000Z	kingspawn	gnomefreak	files ending with a ~ are usually emacs backups
