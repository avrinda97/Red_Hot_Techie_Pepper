2007-02-11T13:01:00.000Z	kenthomson		Hello i am in a little trouble can somebody please help me? It's about kiba-dock, anyone familiar with it?
2007-02-11T13:02:00.000Z	kenthomson		It's like this: Till i am having beryl as my window manager, the kiba-dock will show transparent background (as i have switched off all colours), but as soon as i change my window manager to metacity, the kiba-dock as got this ugly black background, and all the icons to have it around them. Can someone please help me correct this?
