2005-10-08T06:28:00.000Z	egoleo		hello
2005-10-08T06:28:00.000Z	egoleo		is backports not working for breezy?
2005-10-08T06:28:00.000Z	Ng	egoleo	there's nothing to backport yet ;)
2005-10-22T16:00:00.000Z	Ng	egoleo	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats
2005-10-22T16:01:00.000Z	egoleo	Ng	trying that
2005-10-22T06:36:00.000Z	Ng	egoleo	have you followed the DVD instructions on the RestrictedFormats wiki page?
2005-10-22T06:37:00.000Z	Ng	egoleo	specifically, did you run the script that downloads libdvdcss?
2005-10-22T06:37:00.000Z	Ng	egoleo	sometimes people miss that bit
2005-10-22T06:39:00.000Z	Ng	egoleo	sudo /usr/share/doc/libdvdread3/examples/install-css.sh
2005-10-22T06:39:00.000Z	Ng	egoleo	(the script bit)
2005-10-22T06:39:00.000Z	Ng	egoleo	if you already did that bit then ignore me and don't bother doing it again ;)
2005-10-22T06:44:00.000Z	Ng	egoleo	that would mean you don't have libdvdread3 installed, which means you don't have gstreamer0.8-dvd installed, which means you probably didn't completely follow the RestrictedFormats wiki page DVD instructions
2005-10-22T06:46:00.000Z	Ng	egoleo	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats
2005-10-22T06:49:00.000Z	Ng	egoleo	right, ignore that bit, you don't need that repository for the dvd packages
2005-10-22T06:49:00.000Z	Ng	egoleo	people keep rewriting that page so it makes no sense :(
2005-10-22T06:50:00.000Z	Ng	egoleo	start from the bit where they install totem-xine and some gstreamer stuff
2005-10-22T06:52:00.000Z	egoleo	Ng	>> now is given me this problem rather
2005-10-22T06:53:00.000Z	Ng	egoleo	that's not really a problem, it's a warning, you can ignore it and still install packages
2005-10-22T06:54:00.000Z	egoleo	Ng	>> sudo apt-get install totem-xine gstreamer0.8-plugins gstreamer0.8-plugins-multiverse
