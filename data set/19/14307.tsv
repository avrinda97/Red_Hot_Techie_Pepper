2004-10-23T14:31:00.000Z	mteira		I have a lot of problems with usb devices.
2004-10-23T14:31:00.000Z	mteira		Just now, I'm not able to do:
2004-10-23T14:31:00.000Z	mteira		cat /proc/bus/usb/devices
2004-10-23T14:31:00.000Z	mteira		It locks.
2004-10-23T14:31:00.000Z	mteira		Any idea?
2004-10-23T14:31:00.000Z	daniels	mteira	what do you have plugged in?
2004-10-23T14:31:00.000Z	mteira	daniels	Only an scanner.
2004-10-23T14:31:00.000Z	mteira	daniels	But yesterday I also had a usb laser printer.
2004-10-23T14:32:00.000Z	mteira	daniels	Let's try
2004-10-23T14:32:00.000Z	mteira	daniels	OK.
2004-10-23T14:32:00.000Z	mteira	daniels	I'll try after the update.
2004-10-23T14:32:00.000Z	mteira	daniels	I have problems also with dhal and friends.
2004-10-23T14:33:00.000Z	mteira	daniels	Device manager says it's not able to get the device list.
2004-10-23T14:33:00.000Z	mteira	daniels	But dhal is started.
2004-10-23T14:35:00.000Z	mteira	daniels	-k7
2004-10-23T14:35:00.000Z	mteira	daniels	Well, I  have both ones, but I'm using -k7.
2004-10-25T11:47:00.000Z	daniels	mteira	does your system hang for ages if you start with the scanner plugged in?
2004-10-25T11:47:00.000Z	daniels	mteira	if so, then you've hit https://bugzilla.ubuntu.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1923
2004-10-25T11:48:00.000Z	mteira	daniels	Yes.
