2010-10-08T05:34:00.000Z	phil_in_london	HiddenKnowledge	why not just start over, install 10.04 but don't do the apt-get upgrade.
2010-10-08T05:35:00.000Z	HiddenKnowledge	phil_in_london	It's a tool you can use to install linux without a dvd/cd.
2010-10-08T05:35:00.000Z	HiddenKnowledge	phil_in_london	Even from windows.
2010-10-08T05:35:00.000Z	phil_in_london	HiddenKnowledge	and it apparently works great too ;)
