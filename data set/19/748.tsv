2011-09-15T06:56:00.000Z	firc_	usr13	woops sorry, I was dc. Did I miss soemthing?
2011-09-15T06:56:00.000Z	firc_	usr13	yeah. I used apt-get
2011-09-15T06:56:00.000Z	usr13	firc_	have you rebooted since then?
2011-09-15T06:57:00.000Z	firc_	usr13	and I upgraded 11.04 ( apt-get upgrade ) earlier today so all packages are updated. and yes, rebooted.
2011-09-15T06:57:00.000Z	usr13	firc_	How did it work before the reboot?
2011-09-15T06:57:00.000Z	firc_	usr13	same like now. 1024x768 is my max. resolution.
2011-09-15T06:58:00.000Z	usr13	firc_	Does the 1024x768 resolution fit the screen properly?
2011-09-15T06:58:00.000Z	usr13	firc_	How does it look?
2011-09-15T06:59:00.000Z	firc_	usr13	kind of. But icons, etc are still bigger ( at least than my windows install )
2011-09-15T06:59:00.000Z	usr13	firc_	What screen size resolution does windows use?
2011-09-15T07:00:00.000Z	firc_	usr13	1280x1024 I think
2011-09-15T07:00:00.000Z	usr13	firc_	What caused you to install xserver-xorg-intel-video ?
2011-09-15T07:01:00.000Z	firc_	usr13	I think that was installed by default. or maybe someone here told me to install that since I have intel 945gm
2011-09-15T07:02:00.000Z	usr13	firc_	ls /etc/X11/xorg.conf     #Does that file exist on your system?
2011-09-15T07:02:00.000Z	firc_	usr13	it does now, because I created it
2011-09-15T07:02:00.000Z	firc_	usr13	but earlier it did not, no.
2011-09-15T07:03:00.000Z	usr13	firc_	see my pm
2011-09-15T07:03:00.000Z	firc_	usr13	replied
2011-09-15T07:15:00.000Z	firc_	usr13	sorry again. was dc
