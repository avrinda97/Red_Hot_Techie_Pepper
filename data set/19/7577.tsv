2007-09-12T10:36:00.000Z	stefg	aguitel	so you don't have a 'windows' item in your boot menu?

2007-09-12T10:37:00.000Z	aguitel	stefg	it appears in the grub list but do not boot in windows when i press enter key to that
2007-09-12T10:38:00.000Z	stefg	aguitel	the probably the 'chainloader' entry in /boot/grub/menu.lst points to the wrong partition. Did you change your partition layout?
2007-09-12T10:38:00.000Z	aguitel	stefg	,ony reinstalling ubuntu i did
2007-09-12T10:39:00.000Z	stefg	aguitel	so where does your windows live ?

2007-09-12T10:42:00.000Z	aguitel	stefg	,i paste in :http://pastebin.com/dbbbbc39
2007-09-12T10:43:00.000Z	stefg	aguitel	so windows is on the first partition of sda, i assume? post your /boot/grub/menu.lst to pastebin, too, please
2007-09-12T10:45:00.000Z	stefg	aguitel	wait.... there's something really wrong with your partition table on sda1.... as i see just now
2007-09-12T10:46:00.000Z	aguitel	stefg	,i yes windows is in sda :menu.list :http://pastebin.com/d7e58ffa1
2007-09-12T10:48:00.000Z	stefg	aguitel	teh menu.lst looks good for a windows living on sda1... but have a look: sda1 isn't a valid partition. something broke your partition table on /dev/sda
2007-09-12T10:49:00.000Z	stefg	aguitel	high time for a backup
2007-09-12T10:49:00.000Z	aguitel	stefg	,ok
