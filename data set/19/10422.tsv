2009-05-29T18:26:00.000Z	jrib	merlin2049er	so good.  Now install that package
2009-05-29T18:27:00.000Z	jrib	merlin2049er	unfortunately, what you pasted does not say to install 7zip
2009-05-29T18:29:00.000Z	jrib	merlin2049er	so now read the part on the wiki page at the beginning titled "basic archives" to see how you can use archive manager
