2010-10-04T18:46:00.000Z	jazzfish		my wireless doesn't work...  i just installed wubi after a serious crash - in doze I had to manually install driver for it...  I may have to do the same here...
2010-10-04T18:47:00.000Z	acicula	jazzfish	manual driver installation is ussually not needed, just updating ubuntu and/or activating a hardware driver(under administation) may solve your issue
2010-10-04T18:49:00.000Z	acicula	jazzfish	easiest way is to find a network cable, plug it in, update and then from there on in use the wireless drivers.
2010-10-04T18:49:00.000Z	acicula	jazzfish	yeah thats possible
2010-10-04T18:50:00.000Z	acicula	jazzfish	so it is already up to date then?
2010-10-04T18:51:00.000Z	acicula	jazzfish	i understand, its not a given that a wireless driver shows up there. is your system up to date?
2010-10-04T18:59:00.000Z	jazzfish	acicula	fresh install as of yesterday...
2010-10-04T19:03:00.000Z	acicula	jazzfish	after the fresh install did you run the update-manager?
2010-10-04T19:04:00.000Z	jazzfish	acicula	noob here - how do I do that?  Is that not "automatic"?
2010-10-04T19:04:00.000Z	acicula	jazzfish	yes it is
2010-10-04T19:05:00.000Z	acicula	jazzfish	did you poste the output from lspci on pastebin?
