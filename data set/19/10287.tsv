2006-08-13T11:34:00.000Z	davidjohnston		I am very new to linux, but very noob to ubuntu
2006-08-13T11:35:00.000Z	davidjohnston		I decided I was going to do my first install tonight and just use it as a subversion server with a basic apache install
2006-08-13T11:36:00.000Z	davidjohnston		well I decided to go with the server install but for some reason when I load my server install disks it just refuses to do anything with them and I have to do a typical ubuntu install
2006-08-13T11:37:00.000Z	davidjohnston		but anyway, I have finished my ubuntu install, do you all see any problems with now just using gnome to do some slight configurations then stripping all windowing systems and unneeded stuff and then just doing all my server installs
2006-08-13T11:37:00.000Z	davidjohnston		would there be any main difference from the server install...I'm not for sure what all the server version included
2006-08-13T11:38:00.000Z	davidjohnston		i can handle the LAMP install by myself and also the subversion
2006-08-13T11:38:00.000Z	davidjohnston		what do you mean you don't know why they call it LAMP
2006-08-13T11:39:00.000Z	Flannel	davidjohnston	the "server ISO" installs some server optomized kernels, as to what is different for them, I'm not certain.  Theres also a LAMP pre-configure option.  However, stripping everything odwn takes a lot of work, youre better off with the alternate ISO with a 'server' install (which is just the ordinary base (non graphical) system, without special kernels)
2006-08-13T11:43:00.000Z	Flannel	davidjohnston	there is no root user, use sudo instead
2006-08-13T12:00:00.000Z	Flannel	davidjohnston	get the alternate ISO, or the server ISO.
2006-08-13T12:01:00.000Z	davidjohnston	Flannel	 i have the server iso but it won't load for some reason on my machine
2006-08-13T12:01:00.000Z	Flannel	davidjohnston	perhaps you burned it too quckly, 4x is recommended speed
2006-08-14T10:12:00.000Z	Flannel	davidjohnston	ubuntu has iptables, and also provides firestarter, which is an interface to iptables
2006-08-14T10:12:00.000Z	davidjohnston	Flannel	thanks you have been a world of help today
2006-08-14T10:14:00.000Z	davidjohnston	Flannel	actually I don't have firestarter and apt-get can't find it
2006-08-14T10:15:00.000Z	Flannel	davidjohnston	right, it's not installed.  Oh, its a gtk program.  Um.  I'm sure you can find a curses frontend to iptables
2007-01-28T11:47:00.000Z	Flannel	davidjohnston	a win server?  And, your message got cutoff
2007-01-28T11:48:00.000Z	Flannel	davidjohnston	servers are real easy, they don't need much of any hardware at all
2007-01-28T11:49:00.000Z	Flannel	davidjohnston	it got cutoff, again.  There are length limits.  after "and some of these servers can be combined on one machine"
