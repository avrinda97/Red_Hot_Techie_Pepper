2006-09-24T11:05:00.000Z	Sakireth		i want my direct rendering back!
2006-09-24T11:06:00.000Z	ArrenLex	Sakireth	try using the radeon driver
2006-09-24T11:07:00.000Z	Sakireth	ArrenLex	Tried. doesn't work.
2006-09-24T11:07:00.000Z	ArrenLex	Sakireth	why?
2006-09-24T11:07:00.000Z	Sakireth	ArrenLex	Still no direct rendering.
2006-09-24T11:08:00.000Z	ArrenLex	Sakireth	what card?
2006-09-24T11:08:00.000Z	Sakireth	ArrenLex	Radeon 9200. worked on first install.
2006-09-24T11:08:00.000Z	Sakireth	ArrenLex	Then I installed fglrx and overwrote /usr/lib/libGL.so.1.2 for a fix.
2006-09-24T11:08:00.000Z	Sakireth	ArrenLex	Could that be it?
2006-09-24T11:08:00.000Z	ArrenLex	Sakireth	radeon should support that. Can you start x with radeon and then pastebin your /var/log/Xorg.0.log?
2006-09-24T11:09:00.000Z	ArrenLex	Sakireth	I know fglrx requires a hacked version of libGL.
2006-09-24T11:10:00.000Z	ArrenLex	Sakireth	it doesn't matter. If it came with the system it's in a package.
2006-09-24T11:12:00.000Z	Sakireth	ArrenLex	Well atl east I don't get that DRI error anymore.. but i DO get "Direct rendering: NO"
2006-09-24T11:12:00.000Z	ArrenLex	Sakireth	did you install the mesa package, change X to use radeon, and restart X?
2006-09-24T11:12:00.000Z	Sakireth	ArrenLex	Yes
2006-09-25T11:03:00.000Z	Sakireth	ArrenLex	Hi.
2006-09-25T11:03:00.000Z	Sakireth	ArrenLex	I have trouble here. Installed kubuntu-desktop and can't remove it. PC has become slow because of KDE. I tried removing kdelibs and stuff, but... not everything is gone.
2006-09-25T11:09:00.000Z	ArrenLex	Sakireth	why would you want to remove KDE? :(
2006-09-25T11:09:00.000Z	Sakireth	ArrenLex	Made things slow. Messed up my menu's.
