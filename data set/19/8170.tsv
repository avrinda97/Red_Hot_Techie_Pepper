2007-08-29T05:08:00.000Z	deCon		can anyone help me troubleshoot please?>
2007-08-29T05:08:00.000Z	neverblue	deCon	what is the device ?
2007-08-29T05:09:00.000Z	deCon	neverblue	for some reason, it just won't share audio amongst anything, and nothing seems to work without an error for ALSA showing up in term
2007-08-29T05:09:00.000Z	neverblue	deCon	ill ask again, what is the device ?
2007-08-29T05:09:00.000Z	deCon	neverblue	device?
2007-08-29T05:09:00.000Z	deCon	neverblue	like software?
2007-08-29T05:10:00.000Z	neverblue	deCon	no, not 'like software'
2007-08-29T05:10:00.000Z	neverblue	deCon	what hardware device are you using for your audio
2007-08-29T05:10:00.000Z	deCon	neverblue	realtekALC850
2007-08-29T05:10:00.000Z	neverblue	deCon	onboard?
2007-08-29T05:10:00.000Z	deCon	neverblue	yes
2007-08-29T05:11:00.000Z	neverblue	deCon	what application are you using to 'test' your sound ?
2007-08-29T05:11:00.000Z	neverblue	deCon	have you looked at alsamixer  ?
2007-08-29T05:11:00.000Z	deCon	neverblue	yes i believe...here is the full problem...
2007-08-29T05:12:00.000Z	deCon	neverblue	when i open anything that utilizes audio it will work generally, (for an emulated ventrilo program, the mic sounds AWFUL ...but still works)...
2007-08-29T05:12:00.000Z	deCon	neverblue	but amarok/firefox/mplayer etc.. when i choose to use one, they will work as long as it is the first program to access audio after a restart
2007-08-29T05:13:00.000Z	neverblue	deCon	sorry, cannot help you, good luck
2007-08-29T05:13:00.000Z	deCon	neverblue	after that, they will not share/switch/ or work even if i close the first program that used it
