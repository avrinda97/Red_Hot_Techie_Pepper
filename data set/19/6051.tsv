2008-08-10T12:12:00.000Z	DistroJockey	DeFi	you will need to use the Manual option. You should be able to delete the 40GB and use it to make a  /  partition and a  swap  partition (backup first)
2008-08-10T12:13:00.000Z	DeFi	DistroJockey	/ wols_: i cant backup the second partition, and what size and filesystem type must i make the / and swap partition?
2008-08-10T12:13:00.000Z	DistroJockey	DeFi	if you can't backup you really shouldn't be messing around with partitions
2008-08-10T12:14:00.000Z	DeFi	DistroJockey	then how do you suggest i install ubuntu? i dont want to touch the second partition
2008-08-10T12:15:00.000Z	DistroJockey	DeFi	I make swap = to RAM on 2GB systems (so  /  =  40GB - RAM size  and  swap  =  what's left)
2008-08-10T12:15:00.000Z	DeFi	DistroJockey	what fine system must the / be?
2008-08-10T12:15:00.000Z	DistroJockey	DeFi	ext3 for /
2008-08-10T12:16:00.000Z	DeFi	DistroJockey	and swap for swap
2008-08-10T12:16:00.000Z	DistroJockey	DeFi	aye
2008-08-10T12:16:00.000Z	DistroJockey	DeFi	just be sure you set the NTFS to Keep
2008-08-10T12:17:00.000Z	DeFi	DistroJockey	"keep" ?
2008-08-10T12:17:00.000Z	DistroJockey	DeFi	as in don't format it
2008-08-10T12:17:00.000Z	DeFi	DistroJockey	ah yes of course :)
2008-08-10T12:17:00.000Z	DistroJockey	DeFi	break a leg ;)
2008-08-10T12:19:00.000Z	DistroJockey	DeFi	as long as your backup is on a drive that is currently not connected you are fine :)
2008-08-10T12:19:00.000Z	DeFi	DistroJockey	its on the second partition...
2008-08-10T12:19:00.000Z	DistroJockey	DeFi	yeah, thought as much. Be careful :)
2008-08-10T12:20:00.000Z	DeFi	DistroJockey	i managed to corrupt my file system 12 hours ago by editing my xorg.conf file...
2008-08-10T12:20:00.000Z	DistroJockey	DeFi	good luck
