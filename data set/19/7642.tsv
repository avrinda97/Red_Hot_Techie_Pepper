2007-07-20T08:15:00.000Z	nich0s		Does anyone feel like assisting me with an openssh problem?
2007-07-20T08:16:00.000Z	DakotaSmith	nich0s	who are you trying to log in as?
2007-07-20T08:17:00.000Z	nich0s	DakotaSmith	my account
2007-07-20T08:17:00.000Z	DakotaSmith	nich0s	it's OUTSIDE your network that has a problem?  Yeah, you need your firewall to forward port 22 to your Linux box.
2007-07-20T08:18:00.000Z	nich0s	DakotaSmith	I can connect to the box, it refuses to recognize my uname/pw.
2007-07-20T08:18:00.000Z	DakotaSmith	nich0s	you're not trying to log in as root?  What happens if you use ssh -vvv username@host?  Usually verbose mode will reveal a lot of detailed info.
2007-07-20T08:19:00.000Z	nich0s	DakotaSmith	I'm trying to get to the box off of a windows laptop using a proggie called Putty, I don't know if it has a verbose mode. I'm not trying to log in as root...
2007-07-20T08:20:00.000Z	nich0s		I am ssh'd to the term right now using Irssi to talk to you. :P
2007-07-20T08:21:00.000Z	DakotaSmith	nich0s	ah yes, PuTTY -- my favorite Windows app.  :)  Not sure how to do verbose mode on that.  It's a pain in the ass, but you might try getting the Cygwin utilities.  They include a port of OpenSSH, which you call from their port of BASH.
2007-07-20T08:23:00.000Z	DakotaSmith	nich0s	also, if you get the Cyqwom utilities, your Windows box will love you for the rest of your life.  ;)
2007-07-20T08:23:00.000Z	nich0s	DakotaSmith	LOL!
2007-07-20T08:23:00.000Z	nich0s	DakotaSmith	I had that on a previous install, I think my fav aspect was the ability to ls from command prompt.
2007-07-20T08:24:00.000Z	DakotaSmith	nich0s	and you can do cute things, like see your Windows registry from a bash shell ... actually see and delete stuff in the IE cache, and run shell scripts against your own and networked computers.  I drop into bash under cygwin for a huge amount of Windows system administration.
2007-07-20T08:25:00.000Z	DakotaSmith		It's a very weird experience indeed to type 'cd /registry/hklm' and actually see stuff there ... lol
2007-07-20T08:27:00.000Z	DakotaSmith		All the Internet's a stage, and all the people are merely users.  :)
2007-07-20T08:28:00.000Z	DakotaSmith		Well, see y'all later.  I was actually just messing with my new used monitor.  Have a good [ day | afternoon | evening | night ]  (depending on where in the world you are).  :)
2007-07-20T08:28:00.000Z	nich0s	DakotaSmith	Ok, cygwin = installed. Ports = forwarded. Next?
2007-07-20T08:29:00.000Z	DakotaSmith		Oh ... sorry, nich0s  ...
2007-07-20T08:29:00.000Z	DakotaSmith	nich0s	run 'ssh -vvv user@host, and see if it spits out a useful reason why the connection is refused.
