2005-12-04T14:53:00.000Z	maddash	jareth_	how's it feel/look? better when tied to gnome?
2005-12-04T14:54:00.000Z	jareth_	maddash	you have openbox installed already?
2005-12-04T14:54:00.000Z	maddash	jareth_	I've installed openbox, and logged into it w/o gnome, but I can't get any of the desktop icons/taskbar to be displayed
2005-12-04T14:55:00.000Z	jareth_	maddash	try logging into gnome again
2005-12-04T14:55:00.000Z	jareth_	maddash	when logged in type: openbox --replace
2005-12-04T14:55:00.000Z	jareth_	maddash	this will change defailt wm in gnome
2005-12-04T14:56:00.000Z	jareth_	maddash	openbox running alone is pretty bare..
2005-12-04T14:56:00.000Z	maddash	jareth_	no, I got that part already, and I'm actually running openbox on top of gnome, but I can't seem to get openbox w/o gnome working properly...
2005-12-04T14:57:00.000Z	jareth_	maddash	that i haven't found out yet...
2005-12-04T14:57:00.000Z	jareth_	maddash	what problems do you have now then?
2005-12-04T14:58:00.000Z	maddash	jareth_	openbox w/o gnome is rather bare...I'm trying to get some icons/taskbar widgets to be displayed, in addition to the context menu which only launches firefox and the terminal
2005-12-04T14:59:00.000Z	jareth_	maddash	have you looked in .openbox?
2005-12-04T14:59:00.000Z	jareth_	maddash	not existing :)
2005-12-04T15:00:00.000Z	maddash	jareth_	huh? where's it located?
2005-12-04T15:00:00.000Z	maddash	jareth_	I've already tried editing the rc.xml and obconf - they don't do much
2005-12-04T15:01:00.000Z	jareth_	maddash	hmmm thinking.. but....
2005-12-04T15:08:00.000Z	maddash	jareth_	I'm gonna try E16 now. thanks anyway
