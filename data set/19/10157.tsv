2007-07-21T11:52:00.000Z	lmosher		hexstart: There was another system he tried it on that has a Duron 1.3ghz w/ 384 ram and he got the same error. 384 should be enough... 256 isn't rediculus... if you can't even get the -install- going on that, that's pathetic. Ubuntu isn't a bloat OS.
2007-07-21T11:54:00.000Z	lmosher		I'll ask again. Friend got the ubuntu CD shipped to his house now he get's an error: "there was an error starting the GNOME settings daemon". He has 384mb ram - that should be enough. Any ideas why the install fails there?
2007-07-21T11:55:00.000Z	lmosher		TaJ: yes

2007-07-21T11:56:00.000Z	varun0	lmosher	is there any other error message?
2007-07-21T11:56:00.000Z	lmosher	varun0	It's a forum post, that's all the information I have to go on :(
2007-07-21T11:57:00.000Z	varun0	lmosher	can you link me the forum post?
2007-07-21T11:58:00.000Z	lmosher	varun0	It's a priv forum, sorry :(. that's all he says though "there was an error starting the GNOME settings daemon" ..
2007-07-21T11:58:00.000Z	varun0	lmosher	hm. I'm wondering if he installed (all of) gnome correctly?
2007-07-21T11:59:00.000Z	lmosher	varun0	He's just trying to get the installer going. He said "I have goten close to being able to get to the install screen, but there was an error message:... " He's not really trying to do anything special as far as I know.
2007-07-21T11:59:00.000Z	lmosher	varun0	I think the issue is his machine cannot boot the liveCD
2007-07-21T12:00:00.000Z	varun0	lmosher	hm
2007-07-21T12:01:00.000Z	lmosher	varun0	But he hasn't posted the details, I think for now I"ll just ask him for calrification... Maybe he got it booted and it failed during install, but I have a feeling it's failing during the livecd boot.
2007-07-21T12:02:00.000Z	varun0	lmosher	sorry. Command Line Interface. The command prompt
2007-07-21T12:02:00.000Z	lmosher	varun0	No idea, but I would imagine so since he got that text error... that's usually how it works.
2007-07-21T12:03:00.000Z	varun0	lmosher	what if he types startx?
2007-07-21T12:04:00.000Z	varun0	lmosher	LOL. Well it's a little difficult to help second hand :-)
2007-07-21T12:04:00.000Z	lmosher	varun0	I appreciate your help, but I can see that I really just need more info before I can do something. If it's not a common error I'll see if I can't get him to give me all the details. Thanks! :)
2007-07-21T12:04:00.000Z	varun0	lmosher	no problem. sorry I couldn't be of more help
