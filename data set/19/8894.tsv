2007-01-19T17:05:00.000Z	Slart	denardo	connecting a cell phone via bluetooth?
2007-01-19T17:05:00.000Z	denardo	Slart	yes
2007-01-19T17:06:00.000Z	Slart	denardo	I did just that a week ago.. nearly put me in the loony hospital
2007-01-19T17:07:00.000Z	Slart	denardo	I never got it to work.. but I could connect the phone.. apparently .. because I managed to mess up my phonebook
2007-01-19T17:07:00.000Z	denardo	Slart	Ah, so at least it's not me being an idiot :-) It works when booted into Windoze XP, so I'm wondering if the phone's bluetooth is making some assumption about the pairing already being set up.
2007-01-19T17:08:00.000Z	Slart	denardo	bluetooth is a kludge on linux
2007-01-19T17:08:00.000Z	Slart	denardo	I'll see if I can remember what I did
2007-01-19T17:16:00.000Z	Slart	denardo	ok.. did you use the guide at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BluetoothSetup
2007-01-19T17:19:00.000Z	denardo	Slart	Yup, I did. As I attempted to tell ubotu (not realizing he was a bot): OK, I've followed the instructions on that page. My phone's discoverable, but a "sudo hidd --search" doesn't find it, even after I tried the other command that they suggest for Edgy.
2007-01-19T17:20:00.000Z	Slart	denardo	hmm.. same thing here (I'm trying this again).. can't remember what I did to find it... probably some voodoo
2007-01-19T17:21:00.000Z	Slart	denardo	but I can find my computer from the phone (add device pn the phone)
2007-01-19T17:22:00.000Z	Slart	denardo	try hcitool scan
2007-01-19T17:25:00.000Z	denardo	Slart	OK, hcitool scan sees it.
2007-01-19T17:26:00.000Z	Slart	denardo	ah. then you have the address of the phone at least
2007-01-19T17:26:00.000Z	denardo	Slart	Yup. So I may just not be spotting the command or tool to communicate with the phone.
2007-01-19T17:27:00.000Z	Slart	denardo	there are so many of these, hcitool, hidd, rfcomm etc.. I don't know which to run when.. and which of these depend on each other
2007-01-19T17:28:00.000Z	Slart	denardo	oh.. and I had to install some kind of bluetooth pin application.. to be able to input the pin code from the phone
2007-01-19T17:29:00.000Z	denardo	Slart	Yup, I think one of the gazillion apps that I installed does this.
