2005-10-13T15:16:00.000Z	ompaul	Loevborg	there is that,
2005-10-13T15:08:00.000Z	ompaul	Loevborg	they did on all the boxes I installed it on it
2005-10-13T15:09:00.000Z	Loevborg	ompaul	weird because on mine as well as on the one of a friend, it doesn't
2005-10-13T15:09:00.000Z	ompaul	Loevborg	funny mice?
2005-10-13T15:09:00.000Z	Loevborg	ompaul	very regular ones (intellimouse explorer)
2005-10-13T15:10:00.000Z	Loevborg	ompaul	it is not required to have the mouse plugged in at a cretain point of time, now isit?
2005-10-13T15:11:00.000Z	ompaul	Loevborg	no and yes : it should be there when you are configuring the xserver
2005-10-13T15:11:00.000Z	Loevborg	ompaul	is that true?
2005-10-13T15:11:00.000Z	ompaul	Loevborg	well how else is the xserver going to figure out what mouse is there?
2005-10-13T15:12:00.000Z	Loevborg	ompaul	on a laptop it should be a common use case to plug in another mouse which should not require reconfiguring the X server...
2005-10-13T15:13:00.000Z	Loevborg	ompaul	by configuring, you mean dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg? Is there a way to suppress questions about keyboard etc.?
2005-10-13T15:13:00.000Z	ompaul	Loevborg	 yeap and the most basic mice does not have the 3 button syndrome
2005-10-13T15:13:00.000Z	ompaul	Loevborg	i do mean that, and I don't know
2005-10-13T15:13:00.000Z	ompaul	Loevborg	however I do know that it suggests sensible options
2005-10-13T15:15:00.000Z	Loevborg	ompaul	yes, but suggesting dpkg-reconfigure to a neophyte can be embarassing... ("nodeadkeys what??")
2005-10-13T15:15:00.000Z	Loevborg	ompaul	ah maybe "dpkg-reconfigure --default-priority"  wll do the job
2005-11-25T15:01:00.000Z	ompaul	Loevborg	server lag?
2005-11-25T15:01:00.000Z	Loevborg	ompaul	I guess
2005-11-25T15:01:00.000Z	ompaul	Loevborg	I have mine in there and in server and today it kicked me back
