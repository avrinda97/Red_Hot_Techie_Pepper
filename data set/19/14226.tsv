2004-10-18T05:56:00.000Z	wm_eddie		lets face it IBM makes the best laptops
2004-10-18T05:56:00.000Z	t35t0r	wm_eddie	the most expensive ones
2004-10-18T05:58:00.000Z	t35t0r	wm_eddie	you can opt not to use trusted computing
2004-10-18T05:58:00.000Z	wm_eddie	t35t0r	What do you mean?
2004-10-18T05:59:00.000Z	t35t0r	wm_eddie	not have it enabled?
2004-10-18T05:59:00.000Z	t35t0r	wm_eddie	which model are you talking about?
2004-10-18T05:59:00.000Z	t35t0r	wm_eddie	that's just paranoia
2004-10-18T06:00:00.000Z	wm_eddie	t35t0r	It's no paranoia, I won't be using any programs that would use the TC chip.  But I diagree with everything it stands for.
2004-10-18T06:01:00.000Z	t35t0r	wm_eddie	i'm not saying i don't ..but there may come a time when you cannot find one without it
2004-10-18T06:02:00.000Z	t35t0r	wm_eddie	trusted computing is the analog of the patriot act
2004-10-18T06:02:00.000Z	wm_eddie	t35t0r	I hope that day never comes.  I'm not saying I won't buy one, but I'd rather not if I can.
2004-10-18T06:02:00.000Z	t35t0r	wm_eddie	give us your freedom and we'll make sure you are secure
2004-10-18T06:03:00.000Z	t35t0r	wm_eddie	except in RL you can't just "turn off" the patriot act
2004-10-18T06:03:00.000Z	wm_eddie	t35t0r	yes you can. I can move to Canada.
2004-10-18T06:04:00.000Z	t35t0r	wm_eddie	that's not simply "turning it off" ...and i still think living in the US is much better than any other country
2004-10-18T06:04:00.000Z	t35t0r	wm_eddie	just get a generic like an ecs or acer or whatever
2004-10-18T06:05:00.000Z	wm_eddie	t35t0r	I'm actually looking at this one: http://elementcomputer.com/store/product_info.php?cPath=1&products_id=33
2004-10-18T06:06:00.000Z	t35t0r	wm_eddie	how often do people really use the LCD screen in such a manner ..turning it an a crazy obtuse angle
2004-10-18T06:06:00.000Z	wm_eddie	t35t0r	to show it off :p
