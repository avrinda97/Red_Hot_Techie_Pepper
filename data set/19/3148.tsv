2010-08-04T23:18:00.000Z	john38	BluesKaj	i was told nvidia has a special tool unlike Ati that allows secondary monitor support?
2010-08-04T23:24:00.000Z	john38	BluesKaj	i was having a problem with that because my Tv only supports S-video composite video and i have ATI Radeon card i heard Nvidia has no problem with S-video

2010-08-04T23:30:00.000Z	BluesKaj	john38	dunno , you have to make sure you have an s-video out on the card for tv viewing
