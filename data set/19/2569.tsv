2010-07-23T06:01:00.000Z	duli		I'm trying to capture sound in Ubuntu. Actually, I can caputre and play the sound captured. But I cannot listen to the sound I'm capturing while I'm capturing. Any pointers?
2010-07-23T06:03:00.000Z	wiesshund	duli	 what source are you capturing from?
2010-07-23T06:04:00.000Z	duli	wiesshund	Line-in
2010-07-23T06:04:00.000Z	duli	wiesshund	on MIC i get the same result
2010-07-23T06:04:00.000Z	wiesshund	duli	 can you listen to line in when not capturing?
2010-07-23T06:04:00.000Z	duli	wiesshund	no, that's the problem
2010-07-23T06:05:00.000Z	wiesshund		in the mixer did you double check that mute is not checked on both the input and output level of line-in and mic?
2010-07-23T06:05:00.000Z	wiesshund		and for giggles try to mute then unmute
2010-07-23T06:06:00.000Z	duli	wiesshund	you mean in the gnome-volume-control?
2010-07-23T06:06:00.000Z	wiesshund	duli	 system > preference > sound > input
2010-07-23T06:07:00.000Z	duli	wiesshund	yes, the same as gnome-volume-control
2010-07-23T06:08:00.000Z	duli	wiesshund	well, it's unmuted... The input level bar is moving
2010-07-23T06:08:00.000Z	duli		but no sound is heard
2010-07-23T06:10:00.000Z	wiesshund	duli	well i just checked mine and i have the same thing lol
2010-07-23T06:10:00.000Z	duli	wiesshund	guess I'll have to reboot and do it in win...
