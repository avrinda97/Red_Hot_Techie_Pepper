2008-03-24T19:13:00.000Z	aoshi		when I'm watching videos for some reason people look purple now
2008-03-24T19:13:00.000Z	aoshi		and the colors are all wrong
2008-03-24T19:13:00.000Z	aoshi		I just put in a new video card so maybe that's it..
2008-03-24T19:14:00.000Z	ketzerei	aoshi	Do you have the drivers for it installed?
2008-03-24T19:14:00.000Z	ketzerei		Lap_top: MythTV maybe?
2008-03-24T19:14:00.000Z	aoshi	ketzerei	yes
2008-03-24T19:15:00.000Z	aoshi		I actually just reinstalled them.
2008-03-24T19:15:00.000Z	ketzerei	aoshi	Okay, well, somewhere in the preferences menu, theres some video stuff. I couldn't tell you exactly, because I use Kubuntu. Try messing around with that for awhile.
2008-03-24T19:15:00.000Z	aoshi		and restarted.
2008-03-24T19:16:00.000Z	aoshi	ketzerei	do you know of another program for viewing .avis other than Totem?
2008-03-24T19:16:00.000Z	ketzerei		Mplayer
2008-03-24T19:16:00.000Z	ketzerei		WAY better.
2008-03-24T19:16:00.000Z	ketzerei	aoshi	sudo apt-get install mplayer
2008-03-24T19:16:00.000Z	aoshi		kk
2008-03-24T19:17:00.000Z	aoshi		because it only makes them look purple when I'm watching like an avi or mpg
2008-03-24T19:17:00.000Z	aoshi		not a youtube video
2008-03-24T19:17:00.000Z	ketzerei	aoshi	yeah, do you have an ati card?
2008-03-24T19:18:00.000Z	aoshi	ketzerei	installing mplayer fixed it XD
