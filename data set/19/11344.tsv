2007-02-09T08:02:00.000Z	lightcap		argh, why is it possible to compile from source and get apache 2.2 working with svn, but trying to roll your own backports fails miserably when compiling (running tests) for libapache2-svn
2007-02-09T08:03:00.000Z	lightcap		I really don't want to go around the damn package management system so I know what's on my system, but I *need* apache 2.2 and SVN running
2007-02-09T08:05:00.000Z	mnoir	lightcap	if you want to inject a custom built pkg back into your pkg mgt, use checkinstall to do the final install of the built package
2007-02-09T08:05:00.000Z	lightcap	mnoir	I'm not familiar with that...will that just keep tabs on it via dpkg then?
2007-02-09T08:06:00.000Z	mnoir	lightcap	what it does is make a .deb and install that, during an install event
2007-02-09T08:06:00.000Z	lightcap	mnoir	I'm also just tripping on why this damn thing won't build...seems like I've backported all the needed dependencies...
2007-02-09T08:06:00.000Z	mnoir	lightcap	backporting is an adventure....
2007-02-09T08:06:00.000Z	lightcap	mnoir	cool, I'll look into that...that'd have saved me oh, 6 hours today ;-)
2007-02-09T08:07:00.000Z	lightcap	mnoir	always, but this time is a particular bitch.
2007-02-09T08:07:00.000Z	mnoir	lightcap	the nice thing is that you don't need to know how to construct the .deb
2007-02-09T08:07:00.000Z	lightcap		right
2007-02-09T08:07:00.000Z	mnoir	lightcap	it is in the repositories :)
2007-02-09T08:07:00.000Z	lightcap	mnoir	well, shit, now I've gotta go undo all my changes I did today
2007-02-09T08:08:00.000Z	lightcap	mnoir	how have I not known about checkinstall...that's brilliant!
2007-02-09T08:08:00.000Z	lightcap	mnoir	thanks for pointing that little gem out!
2007-02-09T08:09:00.000Z	mnoir	lightcap	i didn't know about it myself until like 4 minths ago :)
2007-02-09T08:09:00.000Z	lightcap		ha ha
2007-02-09T08:09:00.000Z	mnoir	lightcap	i HAVE had it fail
2007-02-09T08:09:00.000Z	mnoir	lightcap	occasionally
