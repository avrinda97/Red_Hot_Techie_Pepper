2005-12-21T17:01:00.000Z	gnomefreak		windows Xp only allows one user at a time
2005-12-21T17:02:00.000Z	Peaker	gnomefreak	there's Switch User in Windows XP now
2005-12-21T17:02:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Peaker	 yes you can switch user but not run 2 users on same XP at same time
2005-12-21T17:03:00.000Z	Peaker	gnomefreak	You can switch user to log in as another user, that's what switch user is all about
2005-12-21T17:03:00.000Z	Peaker	gnomefreak	and then switch back to the open desktop..
2005-12-21T17:03:00.000Z	Peaker	gnomefreak	or you can use "runas" which is like "su"
2005-12-21T17:04:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Peaker	 you could always switch user in XP :( the way he asked it first time was like he wanted 2 users to use linux at same time
2005-12-21T17:05:00.000Z	Peaker	gnomefreak	you can switch user while the existing programs of user still run
2005-12-21T17:05:00.000Z	Peaker	gnomefreak	and you can use terminal services to log in from afar as another user at same time
2005-12-21T17:06:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Peaker	1st off this doesnt belong here second off you CANNOT use 2 peoples login at same time on win anything if you do as you say you can only use 1 persons at a time
2005-12-21T17:06:00.000Z	Peaker	gnomefreak	that is just wrong, at least since WinXP
2005-12-21T17:07:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Peaker	 i have xp installed on other hd
2005-12-21T17:08:00.000Z	Peaker	gnomefreak	runas, switch user, and terminal services allow everything GNU/Linux distributions allow
2005-12-21T17:08:00.000Z	Peaker	gnomefreak	(in terms of multiple users at same time)
2005-12-21T17:11:00.000Z	Peaker	gnomefreak	You can login to Windows via multiple terminal services sessions
2005-12-21T17:12:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Peaker	 ok but if im not mistaken XP or anyother win products do not come defaul like that unless you mean use a DOS term while loged into xp
2005-12-21T17:12:00.000Z	Peaker	gnomefreak	WinXP has terminal services installed by default, I believe
2005-12-21T17:13:00.000Z	Peaker	gnomefreak	which allows for remote gui logins
2005-12-21T17:13:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Peaker	 what your saying sounds like ssh for windows?
