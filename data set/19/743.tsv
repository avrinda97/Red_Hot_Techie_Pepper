2011-09-18T21:02:00.000Z	Guest90616		how i change my self to admin at the recovery mode? or make it have rights for sudo  and even root?
2011-09-18T21:02:00.000Z	theadmin	Guest90616	sudo adduser username admin
2011-09-18T21:03:00.000Z	Guest90616	theadmin	it says admin doesn't exist?
2011-09-18T21:03:00.000Z	theadmin	Guest90616	Huh?...
2011-09-18T21:04:00.000Z	theadmin	Guest90616	You can also try "sudo usermod -aG admin username"
2011-09-18T21:06:00.000Z	Guest90616	theadmin	is gave me errror:' usermod: group 'admin' doesn't exist'
2011-09-18T21:06:00.000Z	theadmin	Guest90616	You seriously made some mess there
2011-09-18T21:07:00.000Z	Guest90616	theadmin	indeed i'm totally at lost i just installed a fresh and some how i messed it up
2011-09-18T21:31:00.000Z	theadmin	Guest90616	sudo ip link set wlan0 up ; wpa_passphrase "whatever" > /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf ; wpa_supplicant -Dwext
2011-09-18T21:31:00.000Z	theadmin	Guest90616	That's the basic idea
2011-09-18T21:32:00.000Z	Guest90616	theadmin	do i have to backup wpa_supplicant.conf before editing?
2011-09-18T21:32:00.000Z	theadmin	Guest90616	I don't think so, unless you had anything there before
2011-09-18T21:33:00.000Z	Guest90616	theadmin	i just want get habit saving the file before changing.
2011-09-18T21:33:00.000Z	theadmin	Guest90616	Well, then do backup, not like I have anything against it
2011-09-18T21:35:00.000Z	Guest90616	theadmin	what is the command to backup the .conf?
2011-09-18T21:35:00.000Z	theadmin	Guest90616	sudo cp /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf.bak
2011-09-18T21:42:00.000Z	Guest90616	theadmin	the requirement for wpa_supplicant . is to sudo apt-get install wpasupplicant?
2011-09-18T21:43:00.000Z	Guest90616	theadmin	the strange thing is their is no file call wpa_supplicant.conf unless i looking at the wrong folder
2011-09-18T21:51:00.000Z	Guest90616	theadmin	you told me to do this ' sudo ip link set wlan0 up ; wpa_passphrase "whatever" > /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf ; wpa_supplicant -Dwext  ' how would i make it automatic connect when i reboot the server?
