2005-11-25T15:12:00.000Z	Archite		Is anyone able to spell check in OpenOffice using AMD64?
2005-11-25T15:13:00.000Z	Archite		spell checking from the command line works fine, but OO does nothing.
2005-11-25T15:15:00.000Z	ompaul	Archite	sudo apt-get install openoffice.org-help-en << might help you
2005-11-25T15:15:00.000Z	Archite	ompaul	I know how to use OO
2005-11-25T15:17:00.000Z	ompaul	Archite	what I am suggesting is that there may be parts missing - like the one I mentioned and this one >>  openoffice.org-l10n-en  << assuming you are using the language englishy
2005-11-25T15:17:00.000Z	ompaul	Archite	language is not really required
2005-11-25T15:17:00.000Z	Archite	ompaul	I got just about everything installed. Kinda weird though
2005-11-25T15:17:00.000Z	Archite	ompaul	I guess just one more issue with a 32-bit prog and a 64-bit system
2005-11-25T15:18:00.000Z	ompaul	Archite	there is a tab that you use for adding in that
2005-11-25T15:18:00.000Z	ompaul	Archite	if you give me a min I will find you something that you may not be aware of
2005-11-25T15:19:00.000Z	Archite	ompaul	thanks
2005-11-25T15:20:00.000Z	ompaul	Archite	tools -> options -> language -> settings languages  << that used to catch me out
2005-11-25T15:21:00.000Z	Archite	ompaul	That's all set up correctly, unfortunitely.
2005-11-25T15:22:00.000Z	ompaul	Archite	well then I have no idea
2005-11-25T15:22:00.000Z	Archite	ompaul	thanks though. This one of the few reasons I hate Ubuntu, you know?
2005-11-25T15:23:00.000Z	ompaul	Archite	you do have to add the spell data as I showed in that last thing but you reckon you  have your stuff installed .. so no idea where to go from there
2005-11-25T15:23:00.000Z	Archite	ompaul	I already installed it all, thinking that was the issue
2005-11-25T15:24:00.000Z	ompaul	Archite	so i noted but I once I do those things it works so there is no additional info I can give you
2005-11-25T15:24:00.000Z	Archite	ompaul	Thanks again ;)
