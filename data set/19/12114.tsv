2006-03-04T13:16:00.000Z	mustard5	bad_iNFO	they are always handy to boot up with if you have problems with another kernel
2006-03-06T11:57:00.000Z	mustard5	bad_iNFO	which channels?
2006-03-06T11:57:00.000Z	mustard5	bad_iNFO	ah ok..I see now

2006-03-06T11:59:00.000Z	mustard5	bad_iNFO	you talking about from the repositories?
2006-03-06T12:00:00.000Z	mustard5	bad_iNFO	I think its to do with whether the source is 'free'
2006-03-06T12:00:00.000Z	mustard5	bad_iNFO	there is free as in beer and free as in free speech..is a analogy that is often used
2006-03-06T12:01:00.000Z	mustard5	bad_iNFO	free as in free beer I meant to say
