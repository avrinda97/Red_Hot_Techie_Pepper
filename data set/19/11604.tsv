2007-01-20T13:26:00.000Z	dimeo		I'm installing ubuntu on a new laptop... and wammo... letter rip... and I've got everything I wanted installed with one sentence!
2007-01-20T13:28:00.000Z	dimeo		if you want a good 3D game on ubuntu... tremulous is *certainly* the most innovative FPS I've seen in a while... I'm not missing Counterstrike much anymore

2007-01-20T13:34:00.000Z	dimeo		whats the best ubuntu-edgy eyecandy I should install?  I looked at compiz, but it's too resource hungry for wiggly windows... anything else worth doing?
2007-01-20T13:34:00.000Z	Ignite	dimeo	you might wanna install the gnome art manager and take a visit to gnome-looks.org and art.gnome.org.
2007-01-20T14:07:00.000Z	Ignite	dimeo	it certainly is.
2007-01-20T14:09:00.000Z	Ignite	dimeo	VirtualBox is generally on par with Vmware workstation for me.
2007-01-20T14:11:00.000Z	Ignite	dimeo	http://virtualbox.org/wiki/Screenshots
2007-01-20T14:12:00.000Z	Ignite	dimeo	I haven't installed Windows in it, I have no need and I lack a license.
2007-01-20T14:16:00.000Z	Ignite	dimeo	it's free as in beer and most is GPL, there are some proprietary things though, that's just USB support and something else, but that's also free as in beer, so you can just download the ubuntu edgy package.
2007-01-20T14:18:00.000Z	Ignite	dimeo	one thing you'll need to do, that confused me a little, is you need to add yourself to a group it creates when it installs, then logout and back in, then restart it by running "VirtualBox shutdown" in the terminal, then starting it from the menu again. Otherwise it doesn't have permission for you... but it's really simple to do, infact, here is a link: http://virtualbox.org/wiki/User_FAQ <-= It's the top Linux users one.
2007-01-20T15:18:00.000Z	Ignite	dimeo	click the link for the virtual CD drive, add an ISO image to the disk manager and choose it from the drop down menu, for physical devices I don't think you have to add anything.
2007-01-20T15:19:00.000Z	Ignite	dimeo	I don't know, I never had that problem, when you start the VM, try pressing f12 so you can choose which device to boot.
