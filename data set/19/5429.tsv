2008-07-04T15:31:00.000Z	cellofellow		hello, I have a Everex STEPNote here with VIA Chrome9 video card. It works ok, except the screen resolution is too high. Displayconfig will set it right, but that doesn't effect the login screen.
2008-07-04T15:31:00.000Z	cellofellow		How do I set the default resolution in Xorg.conf?
