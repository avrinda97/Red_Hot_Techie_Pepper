2011-03-03T23:18:00.000Z	scarleo		Just upgraded to Natty on test computer. Is it at all interesting to report found bugs at this stage? I mean since it's still in Alpha...
2011-03-03T23:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	scarleo	yes log bugs, discussion and support in #ubuntu+1
2011-09-22T12:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	scarleo	if you don't reboot it doesn't affect the OS, you just have a kernel update which needs one to load the new stuff, that'ss all. The OS can happily run fiorever more without you rebooting
2011-09-22T12:44:00.000Z	scarleo	ActionParsnip	Yeah, I can still see a point in being told before committing the update that it will require a reboot to complete
2011-10-10T16:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	scarleo	you cn add the 64bit flash ppa and get native 64bit flash
2011-10-10T16:32:00.000Z	scarleo	ActionParsnip	I know, but since flash 11 is provided in Ubuntu repos I thought that would be enough
2011-10-10T16:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	scarleo	its not the 64bit version
2011-10-10T16:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	scarleo	http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2009/12/64bit-flash-ppa/
2011-10-10T16:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	scarleo	remove all flash plugin packages you have installed, works a treat
2011-10-10T16:33:00.000Z	scarleo	ActionParsnip	Ok, thanks
2011-10-10T16:35:00.000Z	scarleo	ActionParsnip	xangua "Adobe flash 11 providing amd64 support has been released and is available from the ubuntu partner repository>"
2011-10-10T16:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	scarleo	http://ppa.launchpad.net/sevenmachines/flash/ubuntu/dists/   its there
2011-10-15T15:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	scarleo	beat me to it ;)
2011-10-15T15:52:00.000Z	scarleo	ActionParsnip	;)
2011-10-20T01:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	scarleo	what is 'u3'?
2011-10-20T01:11:00.000Z	scarleo	ActionParsnip	It something SanDisk puts on usb sticks so you can have protable apps
2011-10-20T01:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	scarleo	try using dd to write from o to n, should kill it good
2011-10-20T01:12:00.000Z	scarleo	ActionParsnip	I have done that many times, doesn't help
2011-10-20T01:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	scarleo	could jam a magnet next to it as a last resort. I have ressurrected USB flash storage devices using a magnet.
