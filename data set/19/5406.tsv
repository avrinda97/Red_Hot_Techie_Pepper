2009-10-09T10:48:00.000Z	notsonerdysunny		my laptop has this wierd behaviour of the screen dimming when on AC power but bright screen when it is running on battery. I would like to change this behaviour .. how can I do it?
2009-10-09T10:49:00.000Z	DigitalKiwi	notsonerdysunny	what happens when you change the brightness and then unplug/replug
2009-10-09T10:50:00.000Z	notsonerdysunny	DigitalKiwi	I can't increase the brightness with the function key on my laptop .. is there any other way to do it?
2009-10-09T10:51:00.000Z	notsonerdysunny	DigitalKiwi	right now .. the only way for me to increase the brightness is to unplug
2009-10-09T10:53:00.000Z	DigitalKiwi	notsonerdysunny	system > preferences > display
2009-10-09T10:58:00.000Z	DigitalKiwi	notsonerdysunny	did that help?
2009-10-09T11:00:00.000Z	notsonerdysunny	DigitalKiwi	I have been trying the power management thing .. the GUI never comes up .. it seems like it is broken..
2009-10-09T11:01:00.000Z	DigitalKiwi	notsonerdysunny	gnome-power-manager is the binary file on my sys, try running it from cli (or whatever it is named on yours) and see what it says
