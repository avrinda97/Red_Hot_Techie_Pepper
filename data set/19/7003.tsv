2007-11-21T20:49:00.000Z	boris_		i was using gnomebaker to burn the iso to the cd, but it failed and now i cant get my cd out
2007-11-21T20:49:00.000Z	boris_		is there anything i can do , except to tear apart my comp ?
2007-11-21T20:49:00.000Z	Profanephobia	boris_	do you see where the cd is mounted? can you right click the icon and select eject?
2007-11-21T20:50:00.000Z	boris_	Profanephobia	No, i dont see any icon
2007-11-21T20:50:00.000Z	boris_	Profanephobia	but the red light that means something is going on is shining
2007-11-21T20:51:00.000Z	Profanephobia	boris_	maybe just restart?
2007-11-21T20:51:00.000Z	boris_	Profanephobia	ok ill try

2007-11-21T21:08:00.000Z	Profanephobia	boris_	startup-manager is known to cause many problems
2007-11-21T21:08:00.000Z	boris_	Profanephobia	can i somehow revert what it did and delete it ?
2007-11-21T21:09:00.000Z	Profanephobia	boris_	well what all did you do ?
2007-11-21T21:09:00.000Z	boris_	Profanephobia	 well i changed a few things, like show text during boot
2007-11-21T21:21:00.000Z	Profanephobia	boris_	in your BIOS do you have it set to boot from CD-Rom
2007-11-21T21:21:00.000Z	boris_	Profanephobia	 how do i open BIOS ?
2007-11-21T21:22:00.000Z	boris_	Profanephobia	 i gotta press DEL button during startup ?
2007-11-21T21:22:00.000Z	Profanephobia	boris_	when the computer is starting youll see a screen with the logo or name of the computer manufacturer hit what ever button needed to enter setup
2007-11-21T21:31:00.000Z	boris_	Profanephobia	 it seems the cd wont boot, other cds do
