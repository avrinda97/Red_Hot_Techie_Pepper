2009-09-15T18:47:00.000Z	noelferreira		how can i see the encoding of a file?
2009-09-15T18:47:00.000Z	genii	noelferreira	file <filename>    gives some info
2009-09-15T18:48:00.000Z	noelferreira		 Non-ISO extended-ASCII text
2009-09-15T18:48:00.000Z	noelferreira		 genni is the endoing extended-ASCII in this case?
2009-09-15T18:49:00.000Z	noelferreira		genni extended-ACCII is a encoding type. that's because iconv doesn't recognise it.
2009-09-15T18:50:00.000Z	noelferreira		gennii extended-ACCII is a encoding type. that's because iconv doesn't recognise it.
2009-09-15T18:50:00.000Z	noelferreira		genii extended-ACCII is a encoding type. that's because iconv doesn't recognise it.
2009-09-15T18:51:00.000Z	genii	noelferreira	It's probably then iso 8859
2009-09-15T18:53:00.000Z	noelferreira		genii and how can i check that. because there's diffetent types of iso and i need to convert it to utf-8 and o need the correct actual code tu use with iconv
2009-09-15T18:59:00.000Z	genii	noelferreira	Apologies on lag, work required me. You might want to try convmv
2009-09-15T18:59:00.000Z	genii		!info convmv | noelferreira
2009-09-15T19:01:00.000Z	noelferreira	genii	i am using a server where i am not adminsitrator and i can't installl convmv: is there any other option. i just need the correct file encoding listed. the i use iconv
2009-09-15T19:03:00.000Z	genii	noelferreira	Does output of: iconv -l         show 8859 as a type it knows about?
2009-09-15T19:05:00.000Z	noelferreira	genii	iconv -l <filename> gives me all the types available. how can i get the one the file is using?
2009-09-15T19:08:00.000Z	genii	noelferreira	Sometimes: file -i <filename> will give more specific info, but not guaranteed
2009-09-15T19:09:00.000Z	noelferreira	genii	:( text/plain; charset=unknown
2009-09-15T19:10:00.000Z	genii	noelferreira	It's apparently an unknown character set then
2009-09-15T19:11:00.000Z	noelferreira	genii	so how can i convert it to utf-8?
2009-09-15T19:15:00.000Z	genii	noelferreira	If exact coding IS known, with iconv the syntax is like:  iconf -f ISO_8859-1  -t UTF-8 <filename>
