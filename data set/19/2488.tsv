2010-03-27T05:38:00.000Z	Uboss	histo	are you here?
2010-03-27T05:38:00.000Z	histo	Uboss	yes
2010-03-27T05:39:00.000Z	Uboss	histo	I think 4 speakers enabled. My laptop has 4 speakers right? (One friend told me that laptops do have 4. I don't know)
2010-03-27T05:40:00.000Z	histo	Uboss	no most only have two
2010-03-27T05:40:00.000Z	histo	Uboss	just fronts
2010-03-27T05:40:00.000Z	Uboss	histo	In Windows if I set the volume up to 75% the sound plays still good. On Ubuntu at 75% it wasn't clean sound.
2010-03-27T05:41:00.000Z	histo	Uboss	what do you mean by clean sound?
2010-03-27T05:44:00.000Z	histo	Uboss	like white noise when the volume is cranked?
2010-03-27T05:44:00.000Z	histo	Uboss	I would search the forums for your laptop and see if anyone else has commented about that. I'm sure there is a fix out there.
2010-03-27T05:44:00.000Z	Uboss	histo	I'm googling it now. THanks all guys!
