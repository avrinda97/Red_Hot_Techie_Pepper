2005-04-22T16:22:00.000Z	ZyV		well SeamusLP, but i.e. while booting you get the grub saying: "Press F1 for help, ENTER to continue"
2005-04-22T16:22:00.000Z	ZyV		i can't press ENTER !!
2005-04-22T16:23:00.000Z	ZyV		i think maybe it recognizes keyboard during hotplug daemon boot
2005-04-22T16:23:00.000Z	ZyV		yes saik0
2005-04-22T16:23:00.000Z	ZyV		no SeamusLP i cant get working keymoard even in the live cd distrib
2005-04-22T16:24:00.000Z	ZyV		wow ... did you say maybe in my bios i can specify the usb keyboard by default or something SeamusLP and saik0 ???
2005-04-22T16:25:00.000Z	ZyV		ok
2005-04-22T16:25:00.000Z	ZyV		lets try !!! thanx SeamusLP and saik0  !!
2005-04-22T05:07:00.000Z	ZyV		hi everyone again !!
2005-04-22T05:09:00.000Z	ZyV		i've tried the recovery mode with same result webtoe
2005-04-22T05:10:00.000Z	paulfox	ZyV	boot with linux=noacpi, try that
2005-04-22T05:11:00.000Z	paulfox	ZyV	er, that should be linux acpi=off.
2005-04-22T05:11:00.000Z	paulfox	ZyV	i had similar problem with warty, but booting with acpi=off would be fine. what dist is it? warty or hoary?
2005-04-22T05:12:00.000Z	paulfox	ZyV	that problem is fixed with hoary
2005-04-22T05:13:00.000Z	paulfox	ZyV	you should be able to boot then, yeah. but i'd get hoary installed, which fixes this.
2005-04-22T05:26:00.000Z	paulfox	ZyV	thats no problem. you can put pciehp and shpchp in /etc/hotplug/blacklist to not get those errors anymore
2005-04-22T05:26:00.000Z	paulfox	ZyV	yeah you can ignore them
2005-04-22T05:32:00.000Z	paulfox	ZyV	without acpi=off warty will NOT boot. the errors are not important
2005-04-22T05:44:00.000Z	ZyV	paulfox	 definitly it hangs on starting hotplug subsystem
