2008-02-22T22:47:00.000Z	chazco	ejer	- Sounds promising, thanks :)
2008-02-23T02:17:00.000Z	ejer	chazco	look at the font settings in the application, sometimes sizes or kerning gets changed
2008-02-23T02:18:00.000Z	chazco	ejer	- Cant find anything obvious, its the same app as im using on Windows, but renders wrong on Ubuntu. Afaiks the only thing it could be is the fonts...
2008-02-23T02:18:00.000Z	ejer	chazco	could be lots of stuff, including bugs... it is not uncommon for rendering to be different across two platforms, web pages will look different, etc...
2008-02-23T02:19:00.000Z	chazco	ejer	- As I understand the application it is the same code base. It uses their own file format filters and so on. The only aspect that seems to be OS dependant is OLE (not used here) and fonts...
2008-02-23T02:20:00.000Z	ejer	chazco	what is the actual problem?
2008-02-23T02:21:00.000Z	chazco	ejer	- The documents dont display as the do on Windows. Without the msfonts the app uses the best it can find, which comes close to rendering correctly, but not quite. With the msfonts the document renders badly (fonts visibly not padded out) and can end up losing over a page (but not losing it if that makes sense)
2008-02-23T02:22:00.000Z	ejer	chazco	very possible problem is within document itself.. i have never even heard of the app you are using, have you considered using OO or pdf?
2008-02-23T02:23:00.000Z	chazco	ejer	- Happens with mutliple documents... OO gets it worse than Textmaker (its fairly popular). PDF isnt accepted at uni :(
2008-02-23T02:23:00.000Z	chazco	ejer	- PDF also doesnt solve the problem if i need to download a .doc and print it here
2008-02-23T02:23:00.000Z	chazco	ejer	- It doesnt render them as Office does. Textmaker gets much closer, but still not perfect - when it should be
2008-02-23T02:24:00.000Z	ejer	chazco	that is a document problem then IMO... word uses lots of weird formatting
2008-02-23T02:24:00.000Z	chazco	ejer	- I would agree - except when converted to .odt or even .tmd (the Textmaker) format it still happens. I'm 99% sure its something to do with the MS fonts
2008-02-23T02:25:00.000Z	ejer	chazco	as long as MS fonts are installed, what other problem do you think it could be then
2008-02-23T02:25:00.000Z	chazco	ejer	- I was thinking something preventing the usual padding/spacing or something
2008-02-23T02:25:00.000Z	ejer	chazco	you have reset the font size etc?
2008-02-23T02:26:00.000Z	chazco	ejer	- Tried everything that seems obvious (although the solution probably will be simple)... am trying a few last ideas. If I dont make progress i'll send you an example
