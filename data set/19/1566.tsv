2010-12-22T14:42:00.000Z	dc5ala	Freebo	do you know which network card do you have?
2010-12-22T14:42:00.000Z	Freebo	dc5ala	no I do not
2010-12-22T14:43:00.000Z	Freebo	dc5ala	if I type lshw -C network, it says that my network card is DISABLED
2010-12-22T14:43:00.000Z	Freebo	dc5ala	I'm sorry that's not the right interface, forget the last message
2010-12-22T14:44:00.000Z	dc5ala	Freebo	but you see any vendor/chipset info? or try lspci maybe too
2010-12-22T14:45:00.000Z	Freebo	dc5ala	no I do not see it in lspci either
2010-12-22T14:47:00.000Z	Freebo	dc5ala	When I boot ubuntu, sometimes it works and sometimes doesn't. it is really annoying
2010-12-22T14:48:00.000Z	dc5ala	Freebo	is this an onboard one? or what bus type it's using? when it works sometimes maybe there is a conflict with other cards
2010-12-22T14:49:00.000Z	Freebo	dc5ala	I think it is an onboard one
2010-12-22T14:52:00.000Z	dc5ala	Freebo	hard to tell if can't get any info about it =/ which kernel are you running?
2010-12-22T14:54:00.000Z	Freebo	dc5ala	yes I agree it's hard to tell.... I don't understand it either. (Kernel 2.6.32-26)
2010-12-22T14:54:00.000Z	Freebo	dc5ala	what I can try is to reboot again and hope it will work :(
2010-12-22T14:56:00.000Z	dc5ala	Freebo	you could try booting from newer live cd with newer kernel and see if it has same effect
2010-12-22T14:57:00.000Z	Freebo	dc5ala	ok I'll try to upgrade the kernel for now, hoping it will solve the problem
2010-12-22T14:58:00.000Z	Freebo	dc5ala	is there a way to see if there have been a conflict with other modules?
2010-12-22T14:58:00.000Z	dc5ala	Freebo	only if you have old legacy cards, or if you have some interrupts reserved for that, check bios
2010-12-22T14:59:00.000Z	dc5ala	Freebo	you could look at cat /proc/interrupts
2010-12-22T15:00:00.000Z	dc5ala	Freebo	but trying newer Kernel is probably the easier way to go if you have some uncommon network card
2010-12-22T15:01:00.000Z	Freebo	dc5ala	thanks I try the new kernel first and then I'll check for the interrupts
