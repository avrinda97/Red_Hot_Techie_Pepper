2011-06-03T12:35:00.000Z	brylie	osmosis_paul	 check your Apache access.log
2011-06-03T12:36:00.000Z	osmosis_paul	brylie	somebody enter phisicaly in the server i think and upload one file
2011-06-03T12:37:00.000Z	brylie	osmosis_paul	did they access over the network or at a locally attached keyboard?
2011-06-03T12:38:00.000Z	brylie	osmosis_paul	the Apache2 server access.log(s) are located in /var/log/apache2
2011-06-03T12:39:00.000Z	osmosis_paul	brylie	already look there nothing
2011-06-03T12:39:00.000Z	osmosis_paul	brylie	but again they access into the terminal dont have anything with Apache
2011-06-03T12:39:00.000Z	brylie	osmosis_paul	try doing a 'sudo find / -name access.log' from the command line.
2011-06-03T12:41:00.000Z	brylie	osmosis_paul	try this article: http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-log-files-location-and-how-do-i-view-logs-files/
2011-06-03T12:42:00.000Z	osmosis_paul	brylie	thanks
2011-06-03T12:46:00.000Z	brylie	osmosis_paul	you can also find files that were changed in the last day with this command: sudo find / -mtime 1
2011-06-03T12:48:00.000Z	osmosis_paul	brylie	and what mean the 1?
2011-06-03T12:49:00.000Z	brylie	osmosis_paul	1 day
2011-06-03T12:49:00.000Z	brylie	osmosis_paul	/ means root directory
2011-06-03T13:09:00.000Z	osmosis_paul	brylie	it is possible use sudo find / -mtime 1 with less time than one day?
2011-06-03T13:10:00.000Z	osmosis_paul	brylie	and more important thing that told me the dates of every changes?
2011-06-03T13:19:00.000Z	brylie	osmosis_paul	I am looking at the manual for find
2011-06-03T13:28:00.000Z	brylie	osmosis_paul	do you know what user may have edited the file?
