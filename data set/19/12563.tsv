2005-08-12T06:18:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Dolph	sure. I run Ubuntuon an iBook G4
2005-08-12T06:18:00.000Z	Dolph	thoreauputic	ok two questions, 1. Does it run stable, as for i38x, and 2. I'm thinking about installing this on my iMac, but how the .will I get around the fact that it only has one mouse button?
2005-08-12T06:19:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Dolph	1) Stable - yes 2) Get yourself an USB 3button mouse
2005-08-12T06:22:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Dolph	It will be quicker than those mhz suggest
2005-08-12T06:22:00.000Z	Dolph	thoreauputic	good
2005-08-12T06:23:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Dolph	Linux/ubuntu is noticeably more snappy than OS-X on my machine
2005-08-12T06:24:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Dolph	if you can afford more RAM, get it though - makes a difference
2005-08-12T06:25:00.000Z	Dolph	thoreauputic	it's a laptop.. ? :o
2005-08-12T06:26:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Dolph	well, mine's a laptop too - but you could get it with 256 512 or 768MB (Probably up to 1Gig) I have 768MB but 512 would have been fine too
2005-08-12T06:27:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Dolph	not at all - use the F11 and F12 keys
2005-08-12T06:28:00.000Z	Dolph	thoreauputic	what do they do?
2005-08-12T06:28:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Dolph	you can mimic right and left buttons
2005-08-12T06:29:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Dolph	Linux has an "eject" command
2005-08-12T07:01:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Dolph	the package manager takes care of getting the right debs for you
2005-08-12T07:02:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Dolph	there are no win 32 codecs for ppc of course
2005-08-12T07:03:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Dolph	you can set up mac on linux and run multimedia in that, if you want to
2005-08-12T07:04:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Dolph	there's a mac-on-linux howto int he wiki (or was anyway) .. hang on I'll look
