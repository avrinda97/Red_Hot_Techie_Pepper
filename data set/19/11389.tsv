2006-03-01T14:50:00.000Z	Khaaaaan		Guys I cannot get my PCMCIA card WLAN to lite up
2006-03-01T14:50:00.000Z	Khaaaaan		Anybody help?
2006-03-01T14:51:00.000Z	Khaaaaan		NDISGTK seems to think everything is kosher...
2006-03-01T14:52:00.000Z	iBalo	Khaaaaan	have you checked in dmesg if there's firmware to upload to the card and if it's done correctly?
2006-03-01T14:52:00.000Z	Khaaaaan	iBalo	what do you mean?
2006-03-01T14:54:00.000Z	iBalo	Khaaaaan	'dmesg' gives you some system information about hardware setup. read what it spits out
2006-03-01T14:54:00.000Z	Khaaaaan	iBalo	okay one sec
2006-03-01T14:57:00.000Z	Khaaaaan	iBalo	should I put the output into the pastebin??
2006-03-01T14:57:00.000Z	iBalo	Khaaaaan	you could, but i can't promise that this yields any hints
2006-03-01T14:58:00.000Z	Khaaaaan	iBalo	it is better than nothing...
2006-03-01T14:59:00.000Z	Khaaaaan	iBalo	okay I posted it
2006-03-01T15:00:00.000Z	iBalo	Khaaaaan	if you don't give the link i can't see it :-)
2006-03-01T15:00:00.000Z	Khaaaaan	iBalo	oops!
2006-03-01T15:02:00.000Z	Khaaaaan	iBalo	any thoughts??/
2006-03-01T15:03:00.000Z	iBalo	Khaaaaan	this looks messy .-(
2006-03-01T15:03:00.000Z	Khaaaaan	iBalo	I know.... is all that related to the PCMCIA card??
2006-03-01T15:06:00.000Z	Khaaaaan	iBalo	anything?
2006-03-01T15:11:00.000Z	iBalo	Khaaaaan	i'm sorry for you. But it's better to not ruin the system more than it is already by diletantic attempts to fix something I#m not capable of...
2006-03-01T15:12:00.000Z	Khaaaaan	iBalo	man, so are you saying my system is hosed???
