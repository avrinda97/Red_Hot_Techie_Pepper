2008-04-17T09:39:00.000Z	lartza_	nickrud	Notice my post. I pasted the code said in there, because I'm not rally sure about it.
2008-04-17T09:39:00.000Z	nickrud	lartza_	doing that command is not going to break anything
2008-04-17T09:39:00.000Z	nickrud	lartza_	so give it a shot :)
2008-04-17T09:58:00.000Z	nickrud	lartza_	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/TranslatingUbuntu , and #ubuntu-translators will get you going
2008-04-17T10:00:00.000Z	lartza_	nickrud	there is only like 10 ppl besides me on the tranlators channel
2008-04-17T10:01:00.000Z	nickrud	lartza_	so ask them. And the links on that wiki page will get you started.
2008-04-17T10:03:00.000Z	lartza_	nickrud	They are not helping. The wiki is for ubuntu tranlating which happens on launchpad :(
2008-04-17T10:16:00.000Z	nickrud	lartza_	that command would find you the package name to use sudo apt-get install on
2008-04-17T10:17:00.000Z	nickrud	lartza_	it's libavcodec1d now
2008-04-17T10:18:00.000Z	lartza_	nickrud	well then the problem is somewhere else in ffmpeg
2008-04-17T10:18:00.000Z	nickrud	lartza_	and I'm on hardy, so ignore me. Forgot for a sec
2008-04-19T21:33:00.000Z	nickrud	lartza_	in the linux world, yes
2008-04-19T21:34:00.000Z	lartza_	nickrud	So it wont affect if i install the official nvidia drivers from nvidia site?
2008-04-19T21:34:00.000Z	nickrud	lartza_	the latest from nvidia *might* be better, depends on the chip and what they've done
2008-04-19T21:35:00.000Z	lartza_	nickrud	Well then it wont affect me a much since i cant play games that my GFX card can handle :S
2008-04-19T21:35:00.000Z	nickrud	lartza_	myself, I've given up running games in wine, never seem to run as well as they do natively
2008-04-19T21:36:00.000Z	lartza_	nickrud	I can't get some pretty simple games like Icytower or Hellcarrier to work since I have 800mhz cpu
