2011-11-07T09:02:00.000Z	Bpendragon		I have a question. Does anyone know how to run Eclipse (the Java IDE) in Ubuntu?
2011-11-07T09:03:00.000Z	carlosqueso	Bpendragon	you should just be able to install it through software center and run it from the menu
2011-11-07T09:05:00.000Z	Bpendragon	carlosqueso	thanks, I was trying to download and install it from the web. I just switched to Linux a week or so ago and am just learning the ropes.
2011-11-07T09:06:00.000Z	carlosqueso	Bpendragon	welcome to linux!  Your first bet for any software is to search the software center (or Synaptic).  You'll be surprised at how much is there!
2011-11-07T09:06:00.000Z	Bpendragon	carlosqueso	I'll keep that in mind. I'm going to stay in here till I'm sure it installed properly, then I'll skeddadle.
2011-11-07T09:08:00.000Z	carlosqueso		Bpendragon...let me know if you need help
2011-11-07T09:19:00.000Z	Bpendragon	carlosqueso	got it installed, I need to install a specific .jar file, where do I put it on the computer?
2011-11-07T09:19:00.000Z	carlosqueso	Bpendragon	if you installed it through the software center, it should be in your menus and ready to go
2011-11-07T09:21:00.000Z	Bpendragon	carlosqueso	it's not available through the software center. Any ideas?
2011-11-07T09:22:00.000Z	carlosqueso		Bpendragon...sure, open up a terminal and type "sudo apt-get install eclipse"
2011-11-07T09:22:00.000Z	carlosqueso		without the quotes of course
2011-11-07T09:24:00.000Z	Bpendragon		wait... I'm past that. I have eclipse up and running. But I need to get a specific  .jar file available. On windows and mac there's a specific folder you place it in, I was wondering if the same was true for ubuntu, and if so, where
2011-11-07T09:24:00.000Z	carlosqueso		Bpendragon...I'm not sure...what are you trying to do with the jar file?
2011-11-07T09:25:00.000Z	Bpendragon		I need it to be able to use the classes in it, for a class on introductory Java I'm in
2011-11-07T09:26:00.000Z	carlosqueso		Bpendragon...you can do that from within eclipse IIRC
2011-11-07T09:26:00.000Z	carlosqueso		let me fire it up and check
2011-11-07T09:28:00.000Z	carlosqueso	Bpendragon	you shoudl be able to save the file to your home directory or your desktop, then import it using File -> Import in eclipse
2011-11-07T09:28:00.000Z	Bpendragon		ok
2011-11-07T09:32:00.000Z	Bpendragon	carlosqueso	ok, I've got it, thanks.
