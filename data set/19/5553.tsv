2011-07-25T16:39:00.000Z	dli	linuxR	'doesn't work' is a vague statement, please explain in detail about how, error messages, etc.
2011-07-25T16:40:00.000Z	linuxR	dli	when booting from the hard drive (freshly installed ubuntu 11.04), it runs extremely slow (about 20secs to load grub bootloader)
2011-07-25T16:41:00.000Z	dli	linuxR	booting sequence problem?
2011-07-25T16:41:00.000Z	dli	linuxR	set hard drive as the first device to boot
2011-07-25T16:41:00.000Z	linuxR	dli	I did
2011-07-25T16:42:00.000Z	dli	linuxR	does it run smoothly after grub loaded?
2011-07-25T16:42:00.000Z	linuxR		but its grub itself that runs so slow...when I press "e" to edit a grub line, this takes additional 20 seconds to open the edit screen
2011-07-25T16:42:00.000Z	linuxR	dli	no, operating system runs equally slow
2011-07-25T16:43:00.000Z	dli	linuxR	how slow? elaborate
2011-07-25T16:44:00.000Z	linuxR	dli	so slow you can't work with it...some minutes to boot (insteal of 20 seconds), 20 seconds to start a terminal, 10 more seconds to get a prompt..
2011-07-25T16:44:00.000Z	linuxR		when I remove one memory module (doesnt matter which one) it runs perfectly fast
2011-07-25T16:45:00.000Z	dli	linuxR	but the speed seems to be normal when running memtest?
2011-07-25T16:45:00.000Z	linuxR	dli	that is a good question..don't know how fast memtest usually is..but it appeared normal to me
2011-07-25T16:46:00.000Z	dli	linuxR	memtest prints out memory speed, cache speed, etc.
2011-07-25T16:46:00.000Z	linuxR		oh okay..then maybe I should do a little comparison
2011-07-25T16:47:00.000Z	linuxR		I wonder if there are different methods that linux/grub can access system memory
2011-07-25T16:47:00.000Z	linuxR		will also try to install a different OS and see if that one runs okay
2011-07-25T16:47:00.000Z	dli	linuxR	also, try to rearrange order of memory modules, mismatching speed, or gap in address space?
2011-07-25T16:48:00.000Z	linuxR	dli	I already physically switched memory modules, with no change in result
