2010-04-02T14:33:00.000Z	Whisky`		my ethernet connection wouldn't work and it would show as unplugged. Turned out I didn't have anything for eth0 in /etc/network/interfaces so I added a line for it there and now it works. Was that all?
2010-04-02T14:34:00.000Z	Whisky`		hey costre  :)

2010-04-02T14:36:00.000Z	erUSUL	Whisky`	well you just changed one method of configuring it (Network manager) for another traditional debian interfaces file.
2010-04-02T14:37:00.000Z	Whisky`	erUSUL	Network Manager didn't do me ANY good. It still shows my wired network has never been used :/
2010-04-02T14:50:00.000Z	erUSUL	Whisky`	do « sudo iwlist wlan0 scan »
2010-04-02T14:52:00.000Z	erUSUL	Whisky`	sudo ifconfig wlan0 up
2010-04-02T14:53:00.000Z	Whisky`	erUSUL	did that.
2010-04-02T14:53:00.000Z	erUSUL	Whisky`	and? « sudo iwlist wlan0 scan » works ?
2010-04-02T14:53:00.000Z	Whisky`	erUSUL	yes it works now in terminal but KDE's connection manager won't show my network :/
2010-04-02T14:54:00.000Z	erUSUL	Whisky`	:/ i'm not familiar with kde's NM front end.
2010-04-02T14:55:00.000Z	Whisky`	erUSUL	Why wasn't wlan0 up in the first place? :(\
2010-04-02T14:56:00.000Z	erUSUL	Whisky`	in laptops sometiomes the bios downs network to powersave...
2010-04-02T16:52:00.000Z	Whisky`	erUSUL	I fixed my NetworkManager :D it sees my Wired and wireless networks now. But now even with wifi connected, I don;t have internet access :/
2010-04-02T16:54:00.000Z	erUSUL	Whisky`	what do you get if you try to "ping www.google.com"
2010-04-02T16:54:00.000Z	Whisky`	erUSUL	it isn't able to resolve
