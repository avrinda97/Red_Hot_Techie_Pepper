2006-06-10T06:07:00.000Z	devnull		hello i was wondering since i have asked this question about 20 times ... why is it i can connect to wireless networks that are WEP with a passphrase, but no other networks ?????
2006-06-10T06:08:00.000Z	devnull		i just put WEP on it because other wise i can not connect
2006-06-10T06:08:00.000Z	devnull		so why is it my father's windows laptop can connect to every network in anyway but i can only connect to a WEP with a passphrase ?
2006-06-10T06:08:00.000Z	h3sp4wn	devnull	can you reflash it with openwrt check http://toh.openwrt.org
2006-06-10T06:09:00.000Z	devnull	h3sp4wn	reflash what ?
2006-06-10T06:09:00.000Z	h3sp4wn	devnull	The wireless accesspoint
2006-06-10T06:09:00.000Z	devnull	h3sp4wn	why would have i have to flash the AP ??
2006-06-10T06:09:00.000Z	h3sp4wn	devnull	Run linux on it makes stuff easier to debug works better generally (if it is supported)
2006-06-10T06:09:00.000Z	devnull	h3sp4wn	why would i do that
2006-06-10T06:10:00.000Z	h3sp4wn	devnull	see the link above
2006-06-10T06:10:00.000Z	h3sp4wn	devnull	If your router is in it it can be reflashed
2006-06-10T06:11:00.000Z	h3sp4wn	devnull	Run linux on it so you can use iptables instead of whatever junk is currently on there
2006-06-10T06:11:00.000Z	devnull	h3sp4wn	that makes no sense towards my question ... there is no problem with the AP i am connected to it right now
2006-06-10T06:12:00.000Z	h3sp4wn	devnull	What is the problem ?
2006-06-10T06:14:00.000Z	h3sp4wn	devnull	Use wpa_supplicant
2006-06-10T06:14:00.000Z	devnull	h3sp4wn	i have wpa_supplicant ....
2006-06-10T06:14:00.000Z	h3sp4wn	devnull	Well it supports ndiswrapper
2006-06-10T06:14:00.000Z	h3sp4wn	devnull	You can connect using wpa_cli
2006-06-10T06:15:00.000Z	h3sp4wn	devnull	Don't know I don't use any of that stuff
