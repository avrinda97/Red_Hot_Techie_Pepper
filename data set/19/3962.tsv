2009-05-19T16:38:00.000Z	indus		If i change root password, will it ask for password when i log in recovery mode?
2009-05-19T16:38:00.000Z	indus		As i remember ,recovery mode doesnt ask for password for login
2009-05-19T16:39:00.000Z	sipior	indus	yes, i believe it will nowadays.
2009-05-19T16:44:00.000Z	sipior	indus	recovery mode is just single-user mode (runlevel 1). everything is available to you, but not all services are running by default.
2009-05-19T16:53:00.000Z	indus	sipior	thanks
2009-06-10T17:41:00.000Z	sipior	indus	i think ChatWatch is confused. best just to let it go, i think.
2009-06-10T17:41:00.000Z	indus	sipior	ok but is that a bot?
2009-07-30T17:50:00.000Z	indus	sipior	agreed
2009-07-31T15:17:00.000Z	indus	sipior	vikas:now that is strange behaviour isnt it? are you sure you are  saving settings in bios?
2009-07-31T15:21:00.000Z	indus	sipior	he says,in case a customer cant boot windows,they insert sd card ,then grub auto boots from that device
2009-09-09T15:13:00.000Z	indus	sipior	i dont think so
2009-09-09T15:13:00.000Z	indus	sipior	will take much more than taht to install it
2009-09-09T15:13:00.000Z	sipior	indus	doesn't on the machines at my facility.
2009-09-09T15:13:00.000Z	indus	sipior	yeah u mean it takes more time?
2009-09-09T15:13:00.000Z	sipior	indus	no, i don't.
2009-09-09T15:14:00.000Z	indus	sipior	hmm so what is the time taken at your facility
2009-09-09T15:14:00.000Z	sipior	indus	i just mentioned it. is there a point to this conversation?
2009-09-09T15:15:00.000Z	indus	sipior	yes, do you have any average time it takes to install to a 'modern' machine>?
2009-09-09T15:16:00.000Z	sipior	indus	if you have an opinion, please state it. but not to me, as i am not particularly interested. the man asked if his install went too quickly. without evidence to the contrary, i don't see any reason to be overly concerned on this point.
