2010-05-04T01:01:00.000Z	delac		hey! how to disable hibernate and suspend system wide for all users, so that all references will be disabled too (especially in "indicator applet session")?
2010-05-04T01:03:00.000Z	Jowi	delac	System > preferences > Power management. "Make Default". When you add users make sure they are not admins.
2010-05-04T01:05:00.000Z	Jowi	delac	also, if you right click on the ubuntu icon in the top left corner you can edit the menus and remove the preferences you don't want to show.
2010-05-04T01:11:00.000Z	Jowi	delac	for advanced configuration you can set mandatory values in gconf-editor ("gksudo gconf-editor" and select  Help > Contents > Default and Mandatory Settings)
2010-05-04T01:14:00.000Z	delac	Jowi	yes, but exactly what settings i should set to disable the hibernate and suspend?
2010-05-04T01:17:00.000Z	Jowi	delac	/apps/gnome-power-manager/buttons/ (have a look at all the values, right click on the ones you want after you edit them and select "Set as Mandatory")
2010-05-04T01:17:00.000Z	Jowi	delac	I meant have a look at all values under /apps/gnome-power-manager/ :)
2010-05-04T01:17:00.000Z	delac	Jowi	just did, they have no effect whatsoever
2010-05-04T01:19:00.000Z	Jowi	delac	/apps/gnome-power-manager/actions/sleep_type_ac - have a look at the "Lond description" for example. looks like a good match to me.
2010-05-04T01:21:00.000Z	delac	Jowi	i suppose that is the same setting as in Power Management. However it doesnt prevent user from going to hibernate or suspend from "indicator applet session"
2010-05-04T01:24:00.000Z	Jowi	delac	ah. I see your point. hang on let's see what's in there :)
2010-05-04T01:38:00.000Z	Jowi	delac	It's a bug in the indicator applet: https://bugs.launchpad.net/indicator-session/+bug/432598
2010-05-04T01:39:00.000Z	delac	Jowi	have been reading that. i thought it said that the fix has been released
2010-05-04T01:41:00.000Z	Jowi	delac	that what the bug report looks like however /apps/indicator-session/ does not have any suppress_suspend_menuitem etc
2010-05-04T01:42:00.000Z	delac	Jowi	Indeed it doesnt :)
2010-05-04T01:43:00.000Z	Jowi	delac	solution: use "log out button" instead of the indicator session - Bug Closed! ;)
2010-05-04T01:45:00.000Z	delac	Jowi	Actually I was starting to think about that myself too :) Propably the easiest solution at this point... Thanks!
2010-05-04T02:44:00.000Z	delac	Jowi	FYI: at least got what I wanted. I was able to remove those options from everywhere by disabling suspend from BIOS and disabling hibernate by setting my swap less than my ram. Since the Indicator Applet did respond to that, I suspect that there might be some setting somewhere, that would have this same effect. But where...
2010-05-04T02:46:00.000Z	Jowi	delac	yeah that's an idea. Since your problem I got annoyed at those suspend buttons my self so I replaced it with the User Switcher applet which doesn't include them :)
