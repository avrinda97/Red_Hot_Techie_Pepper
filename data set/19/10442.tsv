2011-01-25T21:07:00.000Z	jrib	devios	don't upgrade from intrepid to maverick :/  follow ubottu's instructions on how to properly upgrade (or just do a fresh install)
2011-01-25T21:11:00.000Z	devios	jrib	TheFuzzball: ActionParsnip: it's in a remote datacenter.  physical access not an option.  the proper upgrade instructions say to go From 8.10 to 9.04, but to "Be sure that you have all updates applied to Ubuntu 8.10 before you upgrade. " which is not possible
2011-01-25T21:11:00.000Z	devios	jrib	TheFuzzball: ActionParsnip: is it?
2011-01-25T21:11:00.000Z	jrib	devios	it is possible, read the link ubottu sent you :)
2011-01-25T21:15:00.000Z	devios	jrib	how do i update intrepid prior to going to juanty if intrepid is EOL?
2011-01-25T21:16:00.000Z	devios	jrib	i dont see that in the instructions...
2011-01-25T21:16:00.000Z	jrib	devios	did you read the link I sent you?  It tells you about the old-releases repository: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EOLUpgrades/Intrepid
2011-01-25T21:22:00.000Z	devios	jrib	i found it thx!
2011-01-25T21:39:00.000Z	devios	jrib	TheFuzzball: ActionParsnip: GanjaReefer: backup to complete shortly - then gonna start the process of remotely upgrading from intrepid to jaunty, then jaunty to karmic, then karmic to lucid then lucid to maverick following the instructions at ( https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes ) and ( https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes#Unsupported%20%28Obsolete%29%20Versions ) - will let you know if I am successful or n
2011-01-25T21:40:00.000Z	devios	jrib	TheFuzzball: ActionParsnip: GanjaReefer: thx you all for the help!
2011-01-25T22:48:00.000Z	devios	jrib	TheFuzzball: ActionParsnip: GanjaReefer: intrepid to jaunty upgrade process complete,,, rebooting... *crosees fingers and stops breathing*
2011-01-25T22:49:00.000Z	jrib	devios	only 3 more times!
2011-01-25T22:58:00.000Z	devios	jrib	TheFuzzball: ActionParsnip: GanjaReefer: success! doing next one...
2011-01-25T23:30:00.000Z	devios	jrib	TheFuzzball: ActionParsnip: GanjaReefer: intrepid to jaunty and jaunty to karmic complete! great success!  doing karmic to lucid now, then hopefully lucid to maverick following the instructions at ( https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes ) and ( https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes#Unsupported%20%28Obsolete%29%20Versions ) - so far so good... *crosses fingers again*
2011-01-25T23:30:00.000Z	jrib	devios	by the way, why not just stay on lucid so you only need to upgrade every 2 years (hopping LTS -> LTS)
2011-01-25T23:31:00.000Z	devios	jrib	that clearly makes way too much sense for my dumb ass...
2011-01-25T23:37:00.000Z	devios	jrib	TheFuzzball: ActionParsnip: GanjaReefer: i actually have an edgy system that im gonna try to update all the way up too... lol
2011-01-25T23:38:00.000Z	jrib	devios	you can try e -> f -> g -> h -> l  (you're on the worst releases, the ones right after LTS :P)
2011-01-26T00:54:00.000Z	devios	jrib	TheFuzzball: ActionParsnip: GanjaReefer: intrepid to jaunty, jaunty to karmic, and karmic to lucid done and working!  ( https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes ) and ( https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes#Unsupported%20%28Obsolete%29%20Versions ) - thank you so much!
