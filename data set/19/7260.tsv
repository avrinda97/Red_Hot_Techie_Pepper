2007-09-20T08:25:00.000Z	mindrape		it's a netsplit folks... nothing to see here
2007-09-20T08:27:00.000Z	mindrape		I live in Phoenix, AZ :)
2007-09-20T08:29:00.000Z	mindrape		Flannel - an IDE and everything?
2007-09-20T08:29:00.000Z	mindrape		FLannel - by default most languages only come with the basic compiler... to truly develop you need more.
2007-09-20T08:30:00.000Z	mindrape		Flannel - since writing code in vi is for elitists that don't realize there is a better way.
2007-09-20T08:31:00.000Z	mindrape		Flannel - I need an IDE...
2007-09-20T08:31:00.000Z	mindrape		Flannel - in my mind it does... it's like having a ton of wood, cement, and tile in piles and calling it a house.
2007-09-20T08:33:00.000Z	mindrape		sixpence - he is trying to stay a hardliner to Ubuntu standards... you really shouldn't use root as an ubuntu user (even though it IS possible)
2007-09-20T08:34:00.000Z	sixpence	mindrape	Well judging by the croud, i'm not suprised =P
2007-09-20T08:34:00.000Z	sixpence	mindrape	Maybe, but it get's daunting when you're changing permissions recursively in no specific order and having to sudo each one.
2007-09-20T08:35:00.000Z	sixpence	mindrape	Like I said, judging by the croud, i'm not surpised
2007-09-20T08:36:00.000Z	sixpence	mindrape	You know very well.
2007-09-20T08:36:00.000Z	sixpence	mindrape	Well, compare this channel to the channel of a distro that uses the root user account
2007-09-20T08:37:00.000Z	sixpence	mindrape	Forget Fedora. I'm talking Gentoo, Suse, Arch or Slackware
2007-09-20T08:38:00.000Z	sixpence	mindrape	It's not bothersome. I simply understand the reasoning for the sudo predicate, is all.
2007-09-20T08:39:00.000Z	sixpence	mindrape	I'm not reccomending it. Jeese.
2007-09-20T08:42:00.000Z	sixpence	mindrape	Go figure.
2007-09-20T08:42:00.000Z	sixpence	mindrape	I've been out of the loop for a while.
2007-09-20T08:42:00.000Z	sixpence	mindrape	You used to have to use vfat
