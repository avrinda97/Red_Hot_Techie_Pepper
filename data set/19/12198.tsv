2005-10-08T13:16:00.000Z	tzapachuau		ok
2005-10-08T13:17:00.000Z	tzapachuau		i think VLC does not support it
2005-10-08T13:17:00.000Z	tzapachuau		only Linux OSS
2005-10-08T13:17:00.000Z	tzapachuau		Dummy

2005-10-08T13:17:00.000Z	topyli	tzapachuau	that's very lame
2005-10-08T13:18:00.000Z	tzapachuau		os the best option will be Linux OSS
2005-10-08T13:19:00.000Z	topyli		that's the worst option for linux sound AFAIK, but if you really want vlc, and it supports nothing else, then what the hell
2005-10-08T13:23:00.000Z	tzapachuau	topyli	then how do i change my sound output functions
