2011-08-07T21:49:00.000Z	kernelpanicker		I want install ubuntu on my laptop, then create a virtual win7 (for work reasons)... what's the best route for this?  Should I create the image off the restore partition on the laptop, or is there a way to use the ubuntu installer, then create an kvm image off the shrunk windows 7 partition, then delete that partition?
2011-08-07T21:51:00.000Z	wols	kernelpanicker	neither is possible
2011-08-07T21:52:00.000Z	kernelpanicker	wols	I do have a legit win7 license... am I going to have to go some heinous route with it all?
2011-08-07T21:52:00.000Z	wols	kernelpanicker	restore from restore partition will overwrite your ubuntu and using the shrinked win7 partition in a VM won't work since the hardware will have changed too much (and kvm is the wrong thing to run virtualized windows anyways)
2011-08-07T21:53:00.000Z	kernelpanicker	wols	hmmm... well, they use kvm at the place I work, so I'll have to make it work...
2011-08-07T21:53:00.000Z	wols	kernelpanicker	look at virtualbox instead
2011-08-07T21:54:00.000Z	kernelpanicker	wols	what will virtualbox do over kvm (I'll have to convince my boss on why I don't want to use kvm?
2011-08-07T21:55:00.000Z	wols	kernelpanicker	virtualbox integrates a lot lot better into your ubuntu. remember: you virtualize a desktop OS
2011-08-07T21:56:00.000Z	kernelpanicker	wols	ok.  I'm assuming one can only really virtualize a dektop OS, unless I were running some sort of hypervisor
2011-08-07T21:57:00.000Z	wols	kernelpanicker	yes and no
2011-08-07T21:57:00.000Z	wols	kernelpanicker	what do you need to run on windows?
2011-08-07T21:58:00.000Z	kernelpanicker	wols	It's to test stuff on windows, since that's partly what the company does... and I have to make sure it works,
2011-08-07T21:58:00.000Z	kernelpanicker	wols	we develop software
2011-08-07T21:58:00.000Z	wols	kernelpanicker	test what?
2011-08-07T21:58:00.000Z	kernelpanicker	wols	dll mods etc
2011-08-07T21:59:00.000Z	kernelpanicker	wols	I definitely, tragically, need a win7 vm if I want to work in ubuntu
2011-08-07T21:59:00.000Z	kernelpanicker	wols	I totally wouldn't even mess with win7 if I didn't have to
2011-08-07T21:59:00.000Z	kernelpanicker	wols	and they're all into kvm, so I'm going to have to make it work, alas
2011-08-07T22:00:00.000Z	kernelpanicker	wols	sad to find out it'll be tough, but oh well
