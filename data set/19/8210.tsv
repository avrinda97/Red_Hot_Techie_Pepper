2008-01-12T18:38:00.000Z	Kalamansi	asathoor	firestarter have error like this " error failed to start firewall the device eth1 is not ready" but it is plug there
2008-01-12T18:39:00.000Z	asathoor	Kalamansi	>> firestarter : try Preferences > Network settings, and choose the correct device
2008-01-12T18:41:00.000Z	Kalamansi	asathoor	maybe my eth1 is dead?

2008-01-12T18:45:00.000Z	asathoor	Kalamansi	>> I can see that the network is ok, and you do have an ip adress
2008-01-12T18:46:00.000Z	asathoor	Kalamansi	>> I think Firestarter should be reconfigured.
