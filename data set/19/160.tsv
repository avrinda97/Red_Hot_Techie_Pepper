2012-07-30T06:53:00.000Z	JonnySoTerrible		My instillation of Ubuntu is running rather slow, I installed from windows so I would have a side by side partition.
2012-07-30T06:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JonnySoTerrible	installin from windows willuse Wubi, using a file in your NTFS to store the data
2012-07-30T06:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JonnySoTerrible	can you give some system details please
2012-07-30T06:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JonnySoTerrible	what video chip?
2012-07-30T06:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JonnySoTerrible	did you install the additional driver?
2012-07-30T06:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JonnySoTerrible	not really, it just means you fully use all the features in the hardware
2012-07-30T06:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JonnySoTerrible	tried Unity2D session?
2012-07-30T06:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JonnySoTerrible	before you log in, click the ubuntu logo and change session
2012-07-30T06:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JonnySoTerrible	Unity2D
2012-07-30T06:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JonnySoTerrible	it uses metacity instead of compiz
2012-07-30T06:59:00.000Z	JonnySoTerrible	ActionParsnip	not familiar, but i'll google it, thanks for the advice.
2012-07-30T07:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JonnySoTerrible	i just gave you all you need, what is there you need to look for?
2012-07-30T07:01:00.000Z	JonnySoTerrible	ActionParsnip	So I know what the difference is between the two?
2012-07-30T07:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JonnySoTerrible	I just told you...
2012-07-30T07:01:00.000Z	JonnySoTerrible	ActionParsnip	i'm not familiar with what metacity or compiz is.
2012-07-30T07:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JonnySoTerrible	compiz makes the desktop effects you see, metacity doesn't and uses fewer resources, italso doesn't require 3D accelleration to exist
2012-07-30T07:03:00.000Z	JonnySoTerrible	ActionParsnip	i'd rather have the effects honestly... my setup should be able to handle it, i'm sure it's most likely because I installed using Wubi
2012-07-30T07:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JonnySoTerrible	using wubi doesn't change anything reall
2012-07-30T07:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JonnySoTerrible	if your ntfs is fragmented it may affect speed, otherwise it's the same
