2009-05-19T02:33:00.000Z	dotblank	DarkRavin	hmm is your system up-to date?
2009-05-19T02:34:00.000Z	dotblank	DarkRavin	well in theory it should work.. try using the cdrecord command
2009-05-19T02:36:00.000Z	dotblank	DarkRavin	see if you can force it to use /dev/cdrw
2009-05-19T02:37:00.000Z	dotblank	DarkRavin	use sudo
2009-05-19T02:38:00.000Z	dotblank	DarkRavin	sudo?

2009-05-19T02:40:00.000Z	dotblank	DarkRavin	its like windows' "run as service". when in the terminal you can prefix any command with "sudo " and it will run the command as root
