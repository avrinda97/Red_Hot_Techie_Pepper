2007-06-18T11:21:00.000Z	Cotton-Swab		how can I change the premsissions or var/www?
2007-06-18T11:22:00.000Z	pha|con	Cotton-Swab	who do you want to own the directory?
2007-06-18T11:22:00.000Z	Cotton-Swab	pha|con	the admin
2007-06-18T11:23:00.000Z	pha|con	Cotton-Swab	do you plan on making that directory viewable from the net?
2007-06-18T11:24:00.000Z	pha|con	Cotton-Swab	sudo chown username:users /var/www
2007-06-18T11:24:00.000Z	pha|con	Cotton-Swab	just make sure you don't point httpd at it if you have it installed
2007-06-18T11:27:00.000Z	pha|con	Cotton-Swab	sudo chown yourusername:users /var/www
2007-06-18T11:27:00.000Z	pha|con	Cotton-Swab	just don't point any servers at that dir unless you change it back to root:root
2007-06-18T11:28:00.000Z	Cotton-Swab	pha|con	how could I point a server to that dir?
2007-06-18T11:29:00.000Z	pha|con	Cotton-Swab	then you don't want to change the ownership to /var/www
2007-06-18T11:31:00.000Z	pha|con	Cotton-Swab	if you're trying to set up a LAMP then leave /var/www as being owned by root.  if you want to edit things within that dir then use sudo, or sudo su until you're done working int that dir
2007-06-18T11:31:00.000Z	Cotton-Swab	pha|con	but it is much easier just dragging files into the dir
2007-06-18T11:31:00.000Z	pha|con	Cotton-Swab	if it's internal just make a directory that you can write to and link it from within /var/www
2007-06-18T12:07:00.000Z	pha|con	Cotton-Swab	/etc/apache2
2007-06-18T12:08:00.000Z	pha|con	Cotton-Swab	np
2007-06-18T12:08:00.000Z	Cotton-Swab	pha|con	I don't see a webmin conf, what is the name on it?
2007-06-18T12:08:00.000Z	pha|con	Cotton-Swab	what do you mean by webmin?
2007-06-18T12:09:00.000Z	pha|con	Cotton-Swab	you'll have to use their forum or FAQs, never heard of it
2007-06-18T14:20:00.000Z	pha|con	Cotton-Swab	means you can't change it or del it or read it
