2007-02-21T15:55:00.000Z	paul__		Hi - Can someone please tell me how I can add an application to UBuntu's startup?
2007-02-21T15:56:00.000Z	paul__		Adding programs to startup? Anyone?
2007-02-21T15:57:00.000Z	Jimmey	paul__	system>preferences>session is one way
2007-02-21T15:57:00.000Z	paul__	Jimmey	Another way, you say?
2007-02-21T15:58:00.000Z	Jimmey	paul__	yes, there are a few ways
2007-02-21T15:58:00.000Z	paul__	Jimmey	How would you recommend I add "beryl-manager" to startup
2007-02-21T15:59:00.000Z	Jimmey	paul__	one moment
2007-02-21T15:59:00.000Z	paul__	Jimmey	Cheers.
2007-02-21T16:03:00.000Z	Jimmey	paul__	Ideally, you want to sort the problem you're having with system>preferences>sessions, as you want Beryl to start as soon as you log on, and not as soon as the computer boots..
2007-02-21T16:03:00.000Z	paul__	Jimmey	That's what I figured, so why isn't the command beryl-manager saving?
2007-02-21T16:11:00.000Z	Jimmey	paul__	sorted?
2007-02-21T16:12:00.000Z	paul__	Jimmey	Err - Not yet. I was just saying I am awesome. I'll figure it out in a second, I'm sure.
2007-02-21T16:13:00.000Z	Jimmey	paul__	amen to that :-(
2007-02-21T16:14:00.000Z	Jimmey	paul__	sellout :-(
2007-02-21T16:14:00.000Z	paul__	Jimmey	Again, I don't actually have 3...I was just saying :D
2007-02-21T16:15:00.000Z	Jimmey	paul__	too late. My feelings are already hurt :-P
2007-02-21T16:15:00.000Z	paul__	Jimmey	No help on the startup problem then?
2007-02-21T16:16:00.000Z	Jimmey	paul__	well there's got to me a text file you can edit somewheres. I'll find it in a mo
2007-02-21T16:17:00.000Z	paul__	Jimmey	You'd think so - Just a thought, perhaps I need to add the entire path of beryl-manager, not just "beryl-manager" - What would the path of that executable be in Linux, how can I find out?
