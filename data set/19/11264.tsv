2010-04-09T15:34:00.000Z	amar		seems everyone is busy over here
2010-04-09T15:35:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	amar	might want to try other browser and media players
2010-04-09T15:37:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	amar	what sort of CPU is this?
2010-04-09T15:37:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	amar	like the speed of processor
2010-04-09T15:38:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	amar	and you don't know the CPU specs?
2010-04-09T15:40:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	amar	grep MHz /proc/cpuinfo
2010-04-09T15:41:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	amar	hmm reasonably fast CPU, have you installed the video drivers?
2010-04-09T15:42:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	amar	you meant onboard chipset
2010-04-09T15:45:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	amar	probably a better idea to pastebin lspci -nnk output instead
2010-04-09T15:47:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	amar	hmm I suppose its already using the native driver included, have you tried this on another computer to see if it has the same effect?
2010-04-09T15:48:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	amar	and which version of ubuntu is this?
2010-04-09T15:49:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	amar	I'd try looking for any video driver tweaks, failing that I'd try alternative programs such as chromium and smplayer
2010-04-09T15:50:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	amar	no worries
2010-04-09T15:51:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	amar	probably lot more ideal if you went through hardware drivers for that matter, I'd say it could be a codecs issue somewhere along the lines
2010-04-09T15:52:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	amar	could be the same issue or the output driver is slow
2010-04-09T15:53:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	amar	there's smplayer which allows finetuning, including output driver
2010-04-09T15:54:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	amar	other than that I'm not really sure whats the problem, probably give jaunty a try just to be sure
2010-04-09T15:55:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	amar	I meant running livecd of jaunty
2010-04-09T15:58:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	amar	if you mean firefox as in when loading youtube pages for example or any pages with multimedia, firefox parses on to the decoder via plugins
