2012-10-10T02:08:00.000Z	ISTguy15		does it work in windows now and the bios?
2012-10-10T02:09:00.000Z	ISTguy15		ok if it is an external keyboard it is probably broken or u messed a config up
2012-10-10T02:09:00.000Z	ISTguy15		ok then it sounds like a hardware problem
2012-10-10T02:10:00.000Z	ISTguy15		if it doesn't work in the bios and every other key works its hardware
2012-10-10T02:10:00.000Z	ISTguy15		reset ur bios by moving ur jumper from 1-2 to 2-3 then back
2012-10-10T02:11:00.000Z	ISTguy15		and if u still have the problem get a new keyboard and try
2012-10-10T02:11:00.000Z	ISTguy15		yea its hardware
2012-10-10T02:11:00.000Z	ISTguy15		just try a new keyboard

2012-10-10T02:34:00.000Z	crazydip	ISTguy15	i never heard of massive windows deployments via linux... maybe you can by deplaying virtual servers somehow.. maybe this will help?: http://fai-project.org
