2006-08-30T11:20:00.000Z	ceruleantiger		does anyone here have experience installing ubuntu on a macbook? The alt-install and liveCD will not even boot citing kernel panic. I picked up a liveCD which will boot here: http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=160126&package_id=181927&release_id=397932, but unfortunately, this is text only, and does not even have an installer as far as I can tell
2006-08-30T11:21:00.000Z	ceruleantiger		so does anyone have a guide on installing ubuntu from the command line? I'm guessing this is uncommon/non-existent
2006-08-30T11:21:00.000Z	JoseStefan	ceruleantiger	afaik, macbook is not a power PC
2006-08-30T11:23:00.000Z	JoseStefan	ceruleantiger	afaik, macbook is not a power PC
