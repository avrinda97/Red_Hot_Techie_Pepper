2011-02-12T05:45:00.000Z	torrancew	admini	what version of ubuntu?
2011-02-12T05:45:00.000Z	torrancew	admini	10.<what> ?
2011-02-12T05:46:00.000Z	torrancew	admini	do you know if it's Ubuntu Lucid Lynx, or Maverick Meerkat?
2011-02-12T05:47:00.000Z	torrancew	admini	likely 10.10 Maverick Meerkat
2011-02-12T05:48:00.000Z	torrancew	admini	Afraid I can't help with 10.10 - I've not upgraded yet, and I think they started to introduce some of the graphics changes in that one
2011-02-12T05:54:00.000Z	torrancew	admini	I'm sure some have, but that's not quite enough detail to pin it down
2011-02-12T05:55:00.000Z	torrancew	admini	we can say for sure that your X server is broken
2011-02-12T05:56:00.000Z	torrancew	admini	X is the program that manages the graphical display of your machine
2011-02-12T05:58:00.000Z	torrancew	admini	fglrx is a driver for ATI (i think) graphics cards
2011-02-12T06:01:00.000Z	torrancew	admini	well, it sounds like you don't have many options other than the terminal at the moment...
