2007-04-06T08:48:00.000Z	KurtKraut	bruenig	thanks a lot.
2007-04-06T08:50:00.000Z	bruenig	KurtKraut	you are trying to install or remove? why would post-installation script matter if you are removing?
2007-04-06T08:51:00.000Z	KurtKraut	bruenig	I'm trying to remove
2007-04-06T08:51:00.000Z	KurtKraut	bruenig	the post-installation script is somehow called when I do a remove or purge.
2007-04-06T08:58:00.000Z	bruenig	KurtKraut	ok, try this, sudo sed -i.backup 's/^/#/g' /var/lib/dpkg/info/mldonkey-server.postinst && sudo apt-get remove mldonkey-server
2007-04-06T08:58:00.000Z	KurtKraut	bruenig	thanks for the help, but I just managed to fix the problem thru this: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/mldonkey/+bug/42847
2007-09-03T11:09:00.000Z	KurtKraut	bruenig	but he should be banned to avoid some sort of return
2007-09-03T11:10:00.000Z	bruenig	KurtKraut	well call them
2007-09-30T11:20:00.000Z	KurtKraut	bruenig	I'd not say that... you think you won because your message is prompted to you right after you press enter, not when it is broadcasted to everybody :P
