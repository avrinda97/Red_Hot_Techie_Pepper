2010-03-07T23:38:00.000Z	VCoolio	MgMt	the default permissions for /dev/sda was probably 660, revert that
2010-03-07T23:40:00.000Z	VCoolio	MgMt	do 'mount' and see what /dev/sda2 is mounted to; that's the folder you want to mess with; for example /media/Download
2010-03-07T23:41:00.000Z	VCoolio	MgMt	now in that folder make a new folder that is going to be your user folder, so "sudo mkdir /media/sda2/Downloads" then own it by "sudo chown -R MgMt /media/sda2/Downloads
2010-03-07T23:46:00.000Z	VCoolio	MgMt	try this "sudo chown -R andy:andy /media/sda2/Downloads
2010-03-07T23:49:00.000Z	VCoolio	MgMt	ah, good thinking, try that
2010-03-07T23:49:00.000Z	VCoolio	MgMt	yes
2010-03-07T23:51:00.000Z	VCoolio	MgMt	that's right, sudo umount /dev/blah
2010-03-07T23:55:00.000Z	VCoolio	MgMt	mount again, then try to "mkdir /media/sda2/Downloads/test" (without sudo!)
2010-03-07T23:56:00.000Z	VCoolio	MgMt	yay! you've experienced one of linux' good old permissions annoyances
