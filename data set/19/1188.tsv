2011-04-15T18:19:00.000Z	RetroReactive		Hi, I'm having trouble with the final stage of installation. Whenever I restart and select Ubuntu from the menu it has a black screen with a white rectangle that says I need to have 1600x1200@60hz for the video settings. I have double-checked these but I keep getting the error!
2011-04-15T18:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RetroReactive	what video chip
2011-04-15T18:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RetroReactive	is the system a laptop or branded pc?
2011-04-15T18:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RetroReactive	is it branded or is it a home build?
2011-04-15T18:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RetroReactive	is it for instance a Dell or a Sony desktop system?
2011-04-15T18:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RetroReactive	ok, what model?
2011-04-15T18:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RetroReactive	look around the system, it will tell you
2011-04-15T18:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RetroReactive	aspire doesn't narrow it down enough. We need the model
2011-04-15T18:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RetroReactive	what model sysyem is the Acer, or what video card are you using??
2011-04-15T18:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RetroReactive	ok well try adding the bootoption: nomodeset   may help
2011-04-15T18:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RetroReactive	because if it's an nvidia chip you may need to blacklist the nouveau driver using boot options
2011-04-15T18:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RetroReactive	if you could have told me the model I could have easily websearched to see if it was an nvidia then advised the bootoption
2011-04-15T18:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RetroReactive	which is why I was asking the model
2011-04-15T18:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RetroReactive	make sense now??
2011-04-15T18:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RetroReactive	then use another bootoption:   nouveau.blacklist=1
2011-04-15T18:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RetroReactive	those 2 are great for troublesome nvidia cips, once you get the proprietary driver installed then all will be well
2011-04-15T18:54:00.000Z	RetroReactive	ActionParsnip	About the 'noveau.blacklist=1' thing you told me about, where do I put that?
2011-04-15T18:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RetroReactive	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootOptions
2011-04-15T18:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RetroReactive	doesn't matter, its the same difference
