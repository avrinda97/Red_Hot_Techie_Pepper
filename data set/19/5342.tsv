2008-08-12T02:06:00.000Z	kaiwen	Lunis	you may also want to try searching "c interpreter", if I'm thinkig that's what you want,.
2008-08-12T02:09:00.000Z	kaiwen	Lunis	c interpreter then.
2008-08-12T02:09:00.000Z	kaiwen	Lunis	are you looking for something that doesn't compile?
2008-08-12T02:10:00.000Z	Lunis	kaiwen	in old Visual Stuios we would hit F5 to "build & run"
2008-08-12T02:10:00.000Z	kaiwen	Lunis	that compiles, so you are looking for an IDE
2008-08-12T02:11:00.000Z	kaiwen	Lunis	IDE then, there is kdevelop and eclipse.
2008-08-12T02:11:00.000Z	Lunis	kaiwen	yeah, but i'm not finding a lot in the way of ide's right now
2008-08-12T02:11:00.000Z	kaiwen	Lunis	use eclipse, then, it has that kind of function.
2008-08-12T02:11:00.000Z	Lunis	kaiwen	i've been told eclipse is terrible with C, any truth to that?
2008-08-12T02:11:00.000Z	kaiwen	Lunis	I think it's fine, I'm using it for java and C
2008-08-12T02:12:00.000Z	kaiwen	Lunis	like in all IDE's you need to direct where you compiler is, that's all.
2008-08-12T02:12:00.000Z	kaiwen	Lunis	if you install kdevelop, that has a c/C++ ide
2008-08-12T02:14:00.000Z	kaiwen	Lunis	it's open source ;) and i just checked, kdevelop also has that function you want.
2008-08-12T02:14:00.000Z	kaiwen	Lunis	so go to synaptic and search kdevelop and eclipse and ddd, install them all! and see which one you like best.
2008-08-12T02:14:00.000Z	Lunis	kaiwen	aye
2008-08-12T02:16:00.000Z	kaiwen	Lunis	lol, but it's powerful, it can be used for different languages,
2008-08-12T02:16:00.000Z	Lunis	kaiwen	aye, that's what i'm noticing. impressive for sure
2008-08-12T02:16:00.000Z	Lunis	kaiwen	i'm installing both mind you
2008-08-12T02:17:00.000Z	kaiwen	Lunis	that's good ;)
