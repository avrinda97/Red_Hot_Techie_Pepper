2010-04-05T05:07:00.000Z	subone		wtf is block special
2010-04-05T05:08:00.000Z	alpicola	subone	That just means it's a block device (read: disk)
2010-04-05T05:16:00.000Z	alpicola	subone	Why not just add the apache user to the 'plugdev' group, set DocumentRoot to /media/FreeAgent Drive, and be done with it?
2010-04-05T05:17:00.000Z	subone	alpicola	i will look into that
2010-04-05T05:19:00.000Z	alpicola	subone	Define 'does nothing'.  Do you mean 'doesn't change perms' or 'doesn't accomplish what you need it to accomplish'?
2010-04-05T05:19:00.000Z	subone	alpicola	doesnt change perms
2010-04-05T05:24:00.000Z	subone	alpicola	i just tried what you said adding www to plugdev and still doesnt work, i still get "(13)Permission denied: access to / denied" from apache
2010-04-05T05:38:00.000Z	alpicola	subone	What happens if you try to browse the folder as the apache user (sudo -u www)?
2010-04-05T05:40:00.000Z	subone	alpicola	i never used that command and im failing at trying to :p
2010-04-05T05:41:00.000Z	alpicola	subone	Oh... duh.  It'd help to tell sudo to give you a shell, too.  (sudo -u www -s)
2010-04-05T05:43:00.000Z	subone	alpicola	ls: cannot open directory /media/FreeAgent Drive_/: Permission denied
2010-04-05T05:43:00.000Z	alpicola	subone	Check permissions on /media.
2010-04-05T05:49:00.000Z	alpicola	subone	Yay!  Glad you got that working  =)
2010-04-05T05:50:00.000Z	alpicola	subone	A gentle warning, though.  If that device isn't the first USB device you plug in after boot, your automount might break.
2010-04-05T05:51:00.000Z	subone	alpicola	thats what i was asking earlier, anyway to make sure?
2010-04-05T05:52:00.000Z	alpicola	subone	What psusi said.  Or give it a custom /dev node using UDEV - http://reactivated.net/writing_udev_rules.html
2010-04-05T05:54:00.000Z	subone	alpicola	psusi, ty "UUID=7ED05D74D05D341D /media/FreeAgent\040Drive ntfs defaults 0 0" works
2010-04-05T05:55:00.000Z	subone	alpicola	psusi, Pirate_Hunter, whoever else helped, ty so much
2010-04-05T05:55:00.000Z	alpicola	subone	glad it's working!
