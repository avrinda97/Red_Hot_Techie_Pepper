2009-08-24T04:59:00.000Z	mtlife		is a celeron 500mhz with a geforce2mx to slow for gnome?
2009-08-24T04:59:00.000Z	canthus13	mtlife	Nah.
2009-08-24T05:00:00.000Z	canthus13	mtlife	My wife runs on a PIII 1ghz stuck at 731 mhz, using plain old vesa, and has plenty to spare.
2009-08-24T05:00:00.000Z	mtlife	canthus13	well it feels like there is almost no hardware acceleration going on in the interface itself. the driver in xorg.conf says nvidia though
2009-08-24T05:01:00.000Z	canthus13	mtlife	Odd.
2009-08-24T05:01:00.000Z	mtlife	canthus13	yeah, 786mb :p, glxgears running at 350 fps:|
2009-08-24T05:02:00.000Z	canthus13	mtlife	Compiz might be a bit much though.
2009-08-24T05:05:00.000Z	mtlife	canthus13	yes emailing and browsing should be fine, but it handles sluggish. Example: it runs openttd fine in windows, but it does not in gnome (openttd is a game)
2009-08-24T05:05:00.000Z	canthus13	mtlife	Hmm. trackerd might be running.
2009-08-24T05:07:00.000Z	mtlife	canthus13	how to disable it?
2009-08-24T05:07:00.000Z	canthus13	mtlife	It's kinda rude at times.
2009-08-24T05:07:00.000Z	canthus13	mtlife	Hmm. I don't remember, honestly. Gimme a sec.
2009-08-24T05:08:00.000Z	canthus13	mtlife	Which version are you using?
2009-08-24T05:09:00.000Z	mtlife	canthus13	8.04
2009-08-24T05:10:00.000Z	canthus13	mtlife	Hmm. Look for it in synaptic and uninstall it.
2009-08-24T05:12:00.000Z	canthus13	mtlife	or sudo apt-get remove tracker
2009-08-24T05:12:00.000Z	mtlife	canthus13	i am now running top in a terminal and it says 80% cpu to gnome-panel :|
2009-08-24T05:12:00.000Z	canthus13	mtlife	gnome-panel shouldn't do that.
2009-08-24T05:15:00.000Z	mtlife	canthus13	ah well.. now removing tracker
