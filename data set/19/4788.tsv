2008-11-04T08:45:00.000Z	FAJ	dominik1	ok then you should just have to install aticonfig and it would install the other right packages for your card... does it say what it is trying to install?

2008-11-04T08:48:00.000Z	dominik1	FAJ	yes?
2008-11-04T08:48:00.000Z	FAJ	dominik1	it's because you have another instance of synaptic/ aptitude/apt-get running
2008-11-04T08:48:00.000Z	FAJ	dominik1	 or because you are not sudo
2008-11-04T08:48:00.000Z	dominik1	FAJ	I just closed all, and I do not belive I am root, how do I become root, right now I am dominik
2008-11-04T08:49:00.000Z	FAJ	dominik1	 don't become root, just start your commands with sudo.  so     sudo apt-get install <package-name>
2008-11-04T08:49:00.000Z	FAJ		!sudo | dominik1
