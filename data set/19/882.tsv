2012-02-10T22:18:00.000Z	Benkinooby2		hi, i'm on a lenovo t43p and watching youtube videos is quite resource consuming.. anything i can do about that?
2012-02-10T22:19:00.000Z	auronandace	Benkinooby2	nope, thats flash's fault
2012-02-10T22:19:00.000Z	Benkinooby2	auronandace	 :(
2012-02-10T22:20:00.000Z	Benkinooby2	auronandace	what about that HTML5 stuff?
2012-02-10T22:20:00.000Z	auronandace	Benkinooby2	if your vid is available in html5 that would be great, it would indeed be less resource intensive
2012-02-10T22:24:00.000Z	Benkinooby2	auronandace	 ok i wll head for that ... also will do some investigations towards unsing minitube or vlc to play vids from youtube
2012-02-10T22:24:00.000Z	Benkinooby2	auronandace	thank you for your input
2012-02-10T22:25:00.000Z	auronandace	Benkinooby2	no worries :) (good idea to download and watch them too)
2012-02-10T22:25:00.000Z	Benkinooby2	auronandace	using minitube it only requires 27%
2012-02-10T22:26:00.000Z	Benkinooby2	auronandace	usually it's at 50 or more
2012-02-10T22:26:00.000Z	Benkinooby2	auronandace	i don't think minitube downloads it...
2012-02-10T22:26:00.000Z	Benkinooby2	auronandace	also vlc can stream the vid directly... just enter the youtube url as stream :D
2012-02-10T22:27:00.000Z	Benkinooby2	auronandace	vlc just has trouble with youtube again :(
2012-02-10T22:28:00.000Z	auronandace	Benkinooby2	fat32 has a 4gb max filesize limit, so ntfs is really the only option
2012-02-10T22:30:00.000Z	auronandace	Benkinooby2	thats true of ntfs too
2012-02-10T22:31:00.000Z	Benkinooby2	auronandace	afaic ntfs is not safe for linux writing on it
2012-02-10T22:31:00.000Z	auronandace	Benkinooby2	ntfs write support has been stable for years
2012-02-10T22:32:00.000Z	Benkinooby2	auronandace	ok... i once used it (i admit: was some time ago) and it really messed up stuff... never heard that it is safe to use... but you might be right
2012-02-10T23:04:00.000Z	Benkinooby2	auronandace	wow... minitube uses half the cpu compared to chromium or firefox... even when they are using html 5()
