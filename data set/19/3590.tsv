2009-07-16T15:26:00.000Z	dabukalam		okay
2009-07-16T15:26:00.000Z	dabukalam		haha grub fetish?
2009-07-16T15:26:00.000Z	dabukalam		now how do i reflect those changes in menu.lst?
2009-07-16T15:27:00.000Z	dabukalam		yup
2009-07-16T15:27:00.000Z	dabukalam		i'm at my desktop
2009-07-16T15:27:00.000Z	dabukalam		(home sweet home) i was getting bored of windows 7
2009-07-16T15:27:00.000Z	dabukalam		sudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst?
2009-07-16T15:27:00.000Z	moymoy	dabukalam	did you quickly find that nothing was new? =p
2009-07-16T15:29:00.000Z	dabukalam	moymoy	i disagree, nothing is new on the outside, but there is a huge performance improvement, and it feels a lot more snappy. not ubuntu-snappy, but at least it doesn't look like an undeveloped fetus in comparison to ubuntu
2009-07-16T15:35:00.000Z	moymoy	dabukalam	rofl.. that was exactly what i thought when i first used ubuntu .. but it's exactly that undeveloped fetus look that makes ubuntu so recognizeable ... i went to a Japanese marken out in the suburbs, and i noticed that their cash registers used Ubuntu .. the window took the whole screen, but i recognized the human theme
2009-07-16T15:36:00.000Z	dabukalam	moymoy	if it wasn't for active directory, windows would have died out ages ago
2009-07-16T15:37:00.000Z	dabukalam	moymoy	but windows 7 is a definite improvement, and if microsoft keeps working, i see some potential by windows 15/16
2009-07-16T15:38:00.000Z	moymoy	dabukalam	i haven't tested windows 7 myself, but i've heard too many mixed reviews to really believe anything
2009-07-16T15:39:00.000Z	dabukalam	moymoy	try it. you have nothing to lose
2009-07-16T15:39:00.000Z	dabukalam	moymoy	you shouldn't give your own reviews on something from simply what you've read
2009-07-16T15:42:00.000Z	moymoy	dabukalam	dragon_: already downloading =p .. now all i have to do is compile my virtualbox module D; .. i'll do that when i'm not messing with "galaxy"
