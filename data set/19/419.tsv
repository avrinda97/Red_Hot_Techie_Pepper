2012-03-15T07:06:00.000Z	Jeremy3D		how do i use metacity instead of compiz?
2012-03-15T07:07:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	Jeremy3D	what desktop are you running?
2012-03-15T07:07:00.000Z	Jeremy3D	Fyodorovna	i did metacity --replace command but i lost all taskbars, panels, toolbars, etc
2012-03-15T07:08:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	Jeremy3D	you have a panel on the left if so that is unity and it is a compiz plugin the window manager is compiz
2012-03-15T07:08:00.000Z	Jeremy3D	Fyodorovna	yea i have a panel on the left
2012-03-15T07:08:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	Jeremy3D	you did. :) you need to run compiz
2012-03-15T07:09:00.000Z	Jeremy3D	Fyodorovna	basically i'm using Blender for 3d but my Alt keys are being overrun by ubuntu (or compiz?). i read changing the metacity keybindings in gconfig will fix it but it didnt do anything for me
2012-03-15T07:09:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	Jeremy3D	there are keybindings in compiz but I have never messed around there.
2012-03-15T07:10:00.000Z	Jeremy3D	Fyodorovna	someone mentioned using metacity --replace so to use blender, both for the key bindings and because compiz wont be eating up my graphics processing power
2012-03-15T07:10:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	Jeremy3D	not sure really I only tweak my setup a little really.
2012-03-15T07:10:00.000Z	Jeremy3D	Fyodorovna	i've searched all over the net and nothing seems to be working. unless i remap everything and i was hoping i could just change ALT keys to SUPER keys like you can with metacity
2012-03-15T07:11:00.000Z	Jeremy3D	Fyodorovna	but i cant figure out why when i run metacity i lose all my panels and whatnot
2012-03-15T07:11:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	Jeremy3D	because all that runs with a compiz plugin, you replaced compiz with metacity
2012-03-15T07:12:00.000Z	Jeremy3D	Fyodorovna	is there anyway to run metacity with metacity plugins?
2012-03-15T07:12:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	Jeremy3D	not sure really.
2012-05-06T23:57:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	Jeremy3D	you can change the edges pressure point in compizconfig settings manager.
2012-05-06T23:59:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	Jeremy3D	Yeah the control is in the unity plugin 3rd tab
2012-05-07T00:02:00.000Z	Jeremy3D	Fyodorovna	which one do i want? none seem to be doing much. Launcher Reveal Edge Responsiveness, Launcher Reveal Pressure, Launcher Edge Stop Overcome Pressure, Pressure Decay Rate, Edge Stop Velocity
2012-05-07T00:05:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	Jeremy3D	I am in gnome 3 right now, but I think I set the Reveal Edge Responsiveness at 10 so you kind of have to mess around a bit
