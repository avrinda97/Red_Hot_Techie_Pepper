2007-12-11T00:01:00.000Z	differentreality	soundray	yes :)
2007-12-11T00:00:00.000Z	soundray	differentreality	still here?
2007-12-11T00:02:00.000Z	soundray	differentreality	to eliminate duplicate lines in a file called foo, do 'j="init" ; cat foo | while read i ; do test $i == $j ; j=$i ; done'
2007-12-11T00:02:00.000Z	soundray	differentreality	sorry, trying again
2007-12-11T00:02:00.000Z	soundray	differentreality	to eliminate duplicate lines in a file called foo, do 'j="init" ; cat foo | while read i ; do test $i == $j || echo $i ; j=$i ; done'
2007-12-11T00:03:00.000Z	soundray	differentreality	if you don't mind your lines being sorted, you can just do 'cat foo | sort | uniq'
2007-12-11T00:03:00.000Z	soundray	differentreality	argh, I take it all back now
2007-12-11T00:03:00.000Z	differentreality	soundray	hmm i c :)  one question though.. what does j="init" do exactly??
2007-12-11T00:04:00.000Z	soundray	differentreality	initiates the variable j with a value that is unlikely to be equal to the first line in your file
2007-12-11T00:04:00.000Z	differentreality	soundray	what if line1 is equal to line 100  ?
2007-12-11T00:04:00.000Z	soundray	differentreality	question: do your duplicates always succeed one another? Or do you want to eliminate duplicates, even if there are other lines in between?
2007-12-11T00:05:00.000Z	differentreality	soundray	heh exactly that.. other lines might exist in between
2007-12-11T00:05:00.000Z	soundray	differentreality	does the order of the lines in the output matter?
2007-12-11T00:06:00.000Z	differentreality	soundray	 no
2007-12-11T00:06:00.000Z	differentreality	soundray	 but I don't want thems orted
2007-12-11T00:06:00.000Z	differentreality	soundray	 *sorted
2007-12-11T00:08:00.000Z	soundray	differentreality	okay, then you have to go through the file line-by-line, each time checking whether the same line has been issued previously
2007-12-11T00:13:00.000Z	soundray	differentreality	I can't solve that quickly. Perhaps ask in #bash
2007-12-11T00:14:00.000Z	differentreality	soundray	 yes.. tnx anyway :))
