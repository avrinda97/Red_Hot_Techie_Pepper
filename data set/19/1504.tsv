2011-06-17T01:02:00.000Z	raido	eoss	ok, are you wanting a ftp server of are you using this to actually host boot images on the tftp server
2011-06-17T01:03:00.000Z	eoss	raido	use this as a house for cisco IOS images so i can upgrade the IOS
2011-06-17T01:03:00.000Z	raido	eoss	ok
2011-06-17T01:04:00.000Z	raido	eoss	you are running thin is daemon mode yes? i.e. you have a startup script in /etc/init.d
2011-06-17T01:05:00.000Z	eoss	raido	I did sudo service xinetd start
2011-06-17T01:07:00.000Z	raido	eoss	see this: http://www.davidsudjiman.info/2006/03/27/installing-and-setting-tftpd-in-ubuntu/
2011-06-17T01:07:00.000Z	eoss	raido	that's what I used. It worked from the same host the server is on just not from another node =[
2011-06-17T01:12:00.000Z	raido	eoss	ssh-agent will source ~/.ssh
2011-06-17T01:15:00.000Z	raido	eoss	see http://pastebin.com/AKH0jLms
2011-06-17T01:17:00.000Z	raido	eoss	Allow new files to be created. By default, tftpd will only allow upload of files that already exist. Files are created with default permissions allowing anyone to read or write them, unless the -p or -U options are specified.
2011-06-17T01:18:00.000Z	raido	eoss	you neet the "-c" option in the xinetd config
