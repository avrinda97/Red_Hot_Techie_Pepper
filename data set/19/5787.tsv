2012-05-10T13:58:00.000Z	chu	xuserx	In the future, be a little more patient. Someone will come to your help when they know your problem. In the mean time, you haven't verified the PPA. There should have been a little code for you to enter to get the associated public key. What is the PPA?
2012-05-10T14:02:00.000Z	chu	xuserx	Hope you don't mind reading: http://blog.launchpad.net/ppa/adding-a-ppas-key-to-ubuntu
2012-05-10T14:03:00.000Z	chu	xuserx	Did you read the page?
2012-05-10T14:03:00.000Z	chu	xuserx	You just have to add the PPAs key to your install.
2012-05-10T14:04:00.000Z	chu	xuserx	By reading that page I linked you to.
2012-05-10T14:11:00.000Z	chu	xuserx	From doing a search on google, this is what has come up: `sudo add-apt-repository ppa:user/ppa-name' will add the PPA and apparently fetch the key also.
2012-05-10T14:11:00.000Z	xuserx	chu	doesnt work
2012-05-10T14:16:00.000Z	chu	xuserx	Yep, because there is no key associated with the PPA, and PPAs make strict requirements they want keys.
2012-05-10T14:16:00.000Z	chu	xuserx	Follow the steps above to add the associated key
2012-05-10T14:16:00.000Z	chu	xuserx	`sudo add-apt-repository ppa:flexiondotorg/java'
2012-05-10T14:17:00.000Z	chu	xuserx	So, I'm having difficult working out which one you tried. There are two I have given you, one with ppa:user/ppa-name and one with the actual text pasted in.
2012-05-10T14:18:00.000Z	chu	xuserx	And "doesn't work" doesn't really give me any indication what's going on.
2012-05-10T14:20:00.000Z	chu	xuserx	I don't know, apparently there's no key there. You might want to look around the web site where that PPA is and see if they have anything to say about it.
2012-05-10T14:21:00.000Z	chu	xuserx	I can't really help you - I have no idea what you're trying to do (what that PPA does), I have no idea how PPAs work in general, I have just done some quick google searching. Sorry I can't be of more help.
