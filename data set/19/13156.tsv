2006-04-28T13:59:00.000Z	Jake_		im going to stream movies to my xbox in xboxmediacenter and i would rather have samba sharing that anything else
2006-04-28T13:59:00.000Z	Jake_		but is there a way to just put the new package in ubuntu now?
2006-04-28T13:59:00.000Z	anto9us	Jake_	for streams you don't need samba
2006-04-28T14:00:00.000Z	anto9us	Jake_	that wouldn't be a stream, that would be a file share
2006-04-28T14:06:00.000Z	anto9us	Jake_	depends on your hardware, half an hour to an hour maybe on a modern system
2006-04-28T14:07:00.000Z	anto9us	Jake_	oh and bandwidth is an issue too
2006-04-28T14:08:00.000Z	anto9us	Jake_	shouldn't take too long then :)
2006-04-28T14:09:00.000Z	anto9us	Jake_	I usuallly use ssh for remote file access, is that not an option?
2006-04-28T14:11:00.000Z	anto9us	Jake_	ssh is much more secure, inherits permissions of the linux users and can be compressed too
2006-04-28T14:17:00.000Z	anto9us	Jake_	you can configure gdm to log you in automatically, anything you want to run you can put in .bashrc
2006-04-28T14:49:00.000Z	anto9us	Jake_	'man hier' will describe the linux file system hierarchy
