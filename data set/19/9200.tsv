2006-12-22T12:27:00.000Z	jw_606		Can someone help me with an error I get while trying to compile a program please? The error is  "security.h:37:7: warning: no newline at end of file"
2006-12-22T12:28:00.000Z	DarthLappy	jw_606	That's a warning. Shouldn't affect the compilation.
2006-12-22T12:30:00.000Z	DarthLappy	jw_606	Those might 'cause it :)
2006-12-22T12:31:00.000Z	jw_606	DarthLappy	can I pm you these 2 errors? They are only 2 lines
2006-12-22T12:31:00.000Z	DarthLappy	jw_606	Yeah, sure.
2006-12-22T12:33:00.000Z	DarthLappy	jw_606	Did you send the PM?
2006-12-22T12:33:00.000Z	jw_606	DarthLappy	Yes I did
2006-12-22T12:34:00.000Z	DarthLappy	jw_606	Just stick 'em in a pastebin so others can have a look too.
2006-12-22T12:45:00.000Z	DarthLappy	jw_606	Yes?
2006-12-22T12:45:00.000Z	DarthLappy	jw_606	Nope.
2006-12-22T12:45:00.000Z	DarthLappy	jw_606	Your nick isn't registered.
2006-12-22T12:49:00.000Z	jw_606	DarthLappy	sorry :)
2006-12-22T12:50:00.000Z	DarthLappy	jw_606	You don't seem to have the string.h header.
2006-12-22T12:51:00.000Z	jw_606	DarthLappy	that file should have been included with the rest of the source?
2006-12-22T12:51:00.000Z	DarthLappy	jw_606	No, it should have come with gcc, I imagine.
2006-12-22T12:51:00.000Z	jw_606	DarthLappy	is that an easy install then?
2006-12-22T12:51:00.000Z	DarthLappy	jw_606	Anyway, I've gotta head off -- sorry.
2006-12-22T12:52:00.000Z	DarthLappy	jw_606	If you're compiling stuff, you should have it :)
