2011-01-08T02:39:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	alaing	mongy's link works here?
2011-01-08T02:44:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	alaing	when you add a cron job it is tied to a user
2011-01-16T02:20:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	alaing	scp = secure copy, uses ssh for file transfers
2011-01-16T02:21:00.000Z	alaing	ZykoticK9	is that not the same as SFTP?
2011-01-16T02:21:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	alaing	very similar, if not identical
2011-06-26T12:37:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	alaing	use double quotes around the name(s) ---- cd "2001-01-01 - example"
2011-06-26T12:42:00.000Z	alaing	ZykoticK9	thank you
2011-06-26T12:42:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	alaing	glad to help
2011-06-26T12:46:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	alaing	<CAREFUL> "rm *" would remove all files, except subdirectories
2011-06-26T12:47:00.000Z	alaing	ZykoticK9	oh very simpliar to dos delete *.*.
2011-06-26T12:48:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	alaing	exactly, but many gnu/linux files don't have extentions and *.* would NOT delete those
2011-06-26T12:48:00.000Z	alaing	ZykoticK9	could you recommend a good line resource for learning the command line
2011-06-26T12:49:00.000Z	alaing	ZykoticK9	line=online
2011-06-26T12:49:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	alaing	sorry I don't know of one - but I'm sure many exist... good luck
2011-06-26T12:49:00.000Z	alaing	ZykoticK9	thank you once again.
