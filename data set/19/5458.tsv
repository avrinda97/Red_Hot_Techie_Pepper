2008-06-30T21:22:00.000Z	SrgSantos54		hello to all
2008-06-30T21:22:00.000Z	SrgSantos54		i have a question how do i place my wireless card in monitor mode ?!?
2008-06-30T21:24:00.000Z	SrgSantos54		the thing is my fiend and i are trying to see if wep can actually be broken in my own network
2008-06-30T21:24:00.000Z	SrgSantos54		mmm i have no idea it is integrated in my desktop
2008-06-30T21:24:00.000Z	SrgSantos54		where can i find that
2008-06-30T21:25:00.000Z	SrgSantos54		?!?
2008-06-30T21:26:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	SrgSantos54	but not all cards' drivers are compatible with monitor mode
2008-06-30T21:26:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	SrgSantos54	lspci
2008-06-30T21:27:00.000Z	SrgSantos54	Seven_Six_Two	am in the lspci and now ?!?
2008-06-30T21:28:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	SrgSantos54	do you see anything that looks like a wireless card?
2008-06-30T21:31:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	SrgSantos54	I don't see a wireless card there. is it usb?
2008-06-30T21:33:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	SrgSantos54	is there a switch on the laptop to turn it on and off? because there isn't one listed in the devices (even one that linux doesn't recognize)
2008-06-30T21:38:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	SrgSantos54	is it firewire? the one listed is the firewire controller, not a wifi card
2008-06-30T21:39:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	SrgSantos54	oh wait...maybe not
2008-06-30T21:40:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	SrgSantos54	yeah. that's just a firewire controller. not a firewire card
2008-06-30T21:40:00.000Z	SrgSantos54	Seven_Six_Two	> it was working before
2008-06-30T21:41:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	SrgSantos54	sorry, that's not a valid argument for anything. do you have an antenna sticking out of the back of your computer?
2008-06-30T21:42:00.000Z	SrgSantos54	Seven_Six_Two	> yes is wlan
2008-06-30T21:43:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	SrgSantos54	and it's enabled in the bios? Was it working in linux before, or just windows?
