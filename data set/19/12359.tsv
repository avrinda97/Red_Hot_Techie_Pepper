2012-06-25T10:31:00.000Z	vodoo_		no
2012-06-25T10:31:00.000Z	vodoo_		when i using a 32 bit ubuntu. one file size is showed as 1g but when I using 64 bit ubuntu it is showed less then 1gb WHY? this is my question
2012-06-25T10:31:00.000Z	vodoo_		i know what is GB what is MB i want to know why it is different under different OS 32 bit and 64 bit
2012-06-25T10:32:00.000Z	vodoo_		in Linux it just 1000 MB = 1 GB in windows it is 1024MB = 1GB
2012-06-25T10:34:00.000Z	vodoo_		1.0 GB (1,033,324,394 bytes)
2012-06-25T10:34:00.000Z	vodoo_		so you means ubuntu 32 bit uses 1000 schema and ubuntu 64bit use 1024 schema
2012-06-25T10:34:00.000Z	vodoo_		1.0 GB (1,033,324,394 bytes) this is the 32 bit OS says
2012-06-25T10:35:00.000Z	vodoo_		64 bits says some number around 9xx
2012-06-25T10:36:00.000Z	vodoo_		12.04 both 32bit and 64 bit
2012-06-25T10:36:00.000Z	Flannel	vodoo_	They're both 12.04?  Are you sure?
2012-06-25T10:33:00.000Z	Flannel	vodoo_	Exactly how big is the file?
2012-06-25T10:34:00.000Z	Flannel	vodoo_	And what does the 32bit one say it is?
2012-06-25T10:34:00.000Z	Flannel	vodoo_	Also, what versions of Ubuntu are each, the 32 and 64bit?
2012-06-25T10:35:00.000Z	Flannel	vodoo_	And then the 64bit version says what?
2012-06-25T10:35:00.000Z	Flannel	vodoo_	Alright, and what versions of Ubuntu are each of these?
2012-06-25T10:36:00.000Z	Flannel	vodoo_	That's interesting.
2012-06-25T10:38:00.000Z	Flannel	vodoo_	Yeah, there's something odd going on.  Your best course of action is probably to file a bug, that'll get it answered, and maybe fix the problem for the next guy who comes along.
2012-06-25T10:39:00.000Z	Flannel	vodoo_	They should be the same, yes.  Unless you've configured one to use SI and th other to use IEC or something, but if you haven't done that, yeah, they should be the same.
2012-06-25T10:40:00.000Z	Flannel	vodoo_	That's why the different-ubuntu-version question came up, because there has been some changes related to default display somewhat recently
