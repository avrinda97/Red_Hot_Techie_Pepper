2007-11-17T22:01:00.000Z	meta4ical		Could anyone help me? I have an ATI Radeon X800 Pro and when I try to install the restricted drivers and restart I get a black screen? :O
2007-11-17T22:02:00.000Z	josephk	meta4ical	why use the restricted drivers?
2007-11-17T22:02:00.000Z	meta4ical	josephk	Because this is my first time trying Ubuntu and it's the only method I read about and could understand :(
2007-11-17T22:02:00.000Z	josephk		Doesnt the video work without the restricted driver?
2007-11-17T22:03:00.000Z	meta4ical		it does but I things like desktop effects etc are kind of choppy, I also wanted to do some light wine gaming
2007-11-17T22:04:00.000Z	josephk	meta4ical	I have a ATI 9600 and the restricted drivers does not work with compiz effects.  How much memory is on your graphics card?
2007-11-17T22:05:00.000Z	meta4ical		I had a radeon 9600xt and x1550 that I had working on ubuntu 7.04, i forget to mention it's my first time on 7.10 not linux/ubuntu in general ><
2007-11-17T22:05:00.000Z	meta4ical		it's the pci-e version, 256mb
2007-11-17T22:06:00.000Z	josephk		Oh!  I have the ATI version of ATI 9600.  Does your graphics work at all or just a black screen?
2007-11-17T22:06:00.000Z	josephk		AGP version of 9600 (correction)
2007-11-17T22:07:00.000Z	meta4ical	josephk	I recieve a black screen :P
2007-11-17T22:10:00.000Z	josephk	meta4ical	Want to do a side window?
2007-11-17T22:11:00.000Z	meta4ical	josephk	I'm not sure what you mean?
2007-11-17T22:11:00.000Z	josephk		I am using XChat and clicked your name and openned a "dialog" window.
2007-11-17T22:13:00.000Z	josephk		Right click my name and "open dialog window"
