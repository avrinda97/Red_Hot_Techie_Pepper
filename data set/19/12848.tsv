2006-06-09T05:22:00.000Z	arun		hi.. i tried installing g++ and tried to run a program in ubuntu but i keep getting this error http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/15357.. can somebody PLEASE help me solve this..
2006-06-09T05:23:00.000Z	Kyral	arun	whats in test.cpp
2006-06-09T05:24:00.000Z	arun	Kyral	its a C++ simple program that uses a vector.. do you want to see the code
2006-06-09T05:24:00.000Z	Kyral	arun	yes
2006-06-09T05:24:00.000Z	Kyral	arun	pastebin it
2006-06-09T05:24:00.000Z	arun	Kyral	 just a moment
2006-06-09T05:25:00.000Z	arun	Kyral	this is the code i ran http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/15358
2006-06-09T05:26:00.000Z	Kyral	arun	honestly I have no idea what you are trying to do
2006-06-09T05:27:00.000Z	arun	Kyral	Oh! i am writing a program that has a function which creates a STL vector int and returns it..
2006-06-09T05:27:00.000Z	Kyral	arun	its prolly reacting to the garbage in the memory address
2006-06-09T05:28:00.000Z	Kyral	arun	why don't you just do vector<int> a; a.push_back(1); a.push_back(2);
2006-06-09T05:30:00.000Z	arun	Kyral	OK that works.. probably sth wrong with the code
2006-06-09T05:30:00.000Z	Kyral	arun	I could have told you that immeadiatly :P
2006-06-09T05:30:00.000Z	Kyral	arun	I can fix it to do what you want...
2006-06-09T05:30:00.000Z	arun	Kyral	thanks for your help.. i was breaking my head for the past hour thinking sth was wrong with g++ :P:P
2006-06-09T05:31:00.000Z	arun	Kyral	I would really appreciate that
2006-06-09T05:32:00.000Z	Kyral	arun	This SHOULD work http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/15359
2006-06-09T05:33:00.000Z	arun	Kyral	ok i will try that.. thanks a lot
2006-06-09T05:35:00.000Z	arun	Kyral	It worked.. great.. thanks a lot
