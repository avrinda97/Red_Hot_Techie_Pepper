2009-06-18T09:58:00.000Z	Jaunty_Guy		Hello guys and gals
2009-06-18T09:59:00.000Z	Jaunty_Guy		I have really a serious problem and I can't fix it
2009-06-18T09:59:00.000Z	Jaunty_Guy		Can some one help me
2009-06-18T10:00:00.000Z	Jaunty_Guy		OK I just migrated from Windows and I have one problem
2009-06-18T10:00:00.000Z	Jaunty_Guy		The PC freezes at randon times
2009-06-18T10:00:00.000Z	ectospasm	Jaunty_Guy	does it ever exhibit that behavior in Windows?
2009-06-18T09:59:00.000Z	ectospasm	Jaunty_Guy	don't preface your question, or ask to ask, just ask your question already
2009-06-18T10:01:00.000Z	ectospasm	Jaunty_Guy	you could be having a number of problems.
2009-06-18T10:01:00.000Z	ectospasm	Jaunty_Guy	it could be that Ubuntu is stressing your system in ways Windows does not, and you've got a hardware problem that Ubuntu has uncovered.  This is pure conjecture.
2009-06-18T10:02:00.000Z	ectospasm	Jaunty_Guy	you may want to run a benchmarking or stress testing tool to see if your system can handle it.  I suggest mprime.
2009-06-18T10:03:00.000Z	ectospasm	Jaunty_Guy	I had a problem with an old computer randomly hard locking (in Windows and in Linux), and mprime led me to believe the problem was with the memory controller on the motherboard.
2009-06-18T10:03:00.000Z	ectospasm	Jaunty_Guy	does it freeze when you view Flash movies in your browser?
2009-06-18T10:03:00.000Z	ectospasm	Jaunty_Guy	I assume you're using Jaunty?
2009-06-18T10:04:00.000Z	ectospasm	Jaunty_Guy	what flavor (i386 or x86_64)?
2009-06-18T10:12:00.000Z	Jaunty_Guy	ectospasm	how to run mprime ? :) sorry not an expert
2009-06-18T10:17:00.000Z	ectospasm	Jaunty_Guy	you should be able to find a link to the source on the MPrime Wikipedia article.
2009-06-18T10:18:00.000Z	ectospasm	Jaunty_Guy	know that the grub edit is only for that boot, you still need to correct the problem.
2009-06-18T10:21:00.000Z	Jaunty_Guy	ectospasm	OK Thanks ..... I'll get back with the results
