2008-04-26T00:03:00.000Z	joonas_		anyone here who is not busy?
2008-04-26T00:03:00.000Z	DBautell	joonas_	did you 'sudo chmod'?
2008-04-26T00:03:00.000Z	joonas_		i did chmod folder
2008-04-26T00:04:00.000Z	DBautell	joonas_	throw a sudo in front of it
2008-04-26T00:04:00.000Z	joonas_		mkay but how can i change the root permissions?
2008-04-26T00:04:00.000Z	joonas_		it wont let me go further than desktop with cd
2008-04-26T00:07:00.000Z	DBautell		!iso leonardo_
2008-04-26T00:07:00.000Z	joonas_		dbautell, i did it with sudo but still the permissions wont change on root
2008-04-26T00:08:00.000Z	joonas_		still says im not the owner and wont let me change files
2008-04-26T00:09:00.000Z	DBautell		sorry, joonas_ all I caught was the permissions bit, don't know much about full filesystems (if that's where you're at) as far as permissions go
2008-04-26T00:10:00.000Z	joonas_	DBautell	all i need to do is test my php scripts on the server, but it wont let change files in the www folder
2008-04-26T00:12:00.000Z	DBautell	joonas_	you might try adding -R or --recursive to your chmod, which will set permissions for everything below your target
2008-04-26T00:13:00.000Z	joonas_		il try that
2008-04-26T00:13:00.000Z	DBautell		!sound dassouki_, don't know if this will help, but
2008-04-26T00:14:00.000Z	joonas_	DBautell	So i would write sudo chmod 777   -R filename?
2008-04-26T00:14:00.000Z	DBautell		!sound dassouki_
2008-04-26T00:14:00.000Z	DBautell		durn
2008-04-26T00:14:00.000Z	DBautell		!sound |dassouki_
2008-04-26T00:16:00.000Z	DBautell	joonas_	you would 'chmod -R' a directory, and it will change the permissions for all files and dirs underneath it.. sometimes you can change a file but not the directory it's in
