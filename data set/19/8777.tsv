2007-02-09T15:54:00.000Z	fips		anyone here who knows with which options (to configure) and which layout apache2 is compiled for ubuntu?
2007-02-09T15:54:00.000Z	fips		i wanted to compile it without that much modules builtin
2007-02-09T15:54:00.000Z	jrib	fips	read debian/rules of the source package for apache2
2007-02-09T15:55:00.000Z	fips	jrib	ok thx
2007-02-09T15:59:00.000Z	fips	jrib	can you tell me the path to that file, please? i don't find it!
2007-02-09T15:59:00.000Z	jrib	fips	do you know how to obtain the source package for apache2?
2007-02-09T16:00:00.000Z	fips	jrib	oh, i'd obtained it from the apache website...
2007-02-09T16:00:00.000Z	fips	jrib	so: no? ;)
2007-02-09T16:00:00.000Z	jrib	fips	right but to get the source package for the .deb in ubuntu you would do  'apt-get source PACKAGE_NAME_HERE'
2007-02-09T16:02:00.000Z	jrib	fips	once you issue that command, you'll end up with a directory that starts with apache2*.  Inside you will find another directory called "debian" and inside that the "rules" file.  Note that you may need apache2-common's source package, I'm not sure
2007-02-09T16:03:00.000Z	fips	jrib	thank you, that should suffice for me! :)
2007-02-09T16:05:00.000Z	jrib	fips	np, the best way to do what you want (compile with less modules) is probably to edit the source package and then rebuild it.  See http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/apt-howto/ch-sourcehandling.en.html
2007-02-09T16:17:00.000Z	fips	jrib	how do i build this source? 'apt-get build-dep apache2-2.0.55' doesn't work
2007-02-09T16:18:00.000Z	jrib	fips	apt-get build-dep PACKAGE_NAME  gets you the dependencies to build it.  Then you can use dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -uc -b to build the deb
2007-02-09T16:19:00.000Z	fips	jrib	No i get "E: Unable to find a source package for apache2-2.0.55"
2007-02-09T16:20:00.000Z	jrib	fips	use tha package name (apache2)
2007-02-09T16:21:00.000Z	fips	jrib	ah, ok! ;)
2007-02-09T16:29:00.000Z	fips	jrib	it works! :)
2007-02-09T16:30:00.000Z	jrib	fips	np
