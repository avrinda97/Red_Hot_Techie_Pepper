2007-03-15T16:31:00.000Z	craigbass1976	Pollywog	amazing how in some ways we are now spoiled using Linux.  I had to fix a windows box the other day and it rebooted seven or eight times.
2009-02-12T05:34:00.000Z	Pollywog	craigbass1976	yes Ubuntu installs one
2009-02-12T05:35:00.000Z	Pollywog	craigbass1976	you can get that by hitting esc key when the machine boots
2009-02-12T05:36:00.000Z	craigbass1976	Pollywog	when it boots off the cd?
2009-02-12T05:39:00.000Z	craigbass1976	Pollywog	how to I boot to cli only?  I' at a boot: prompt, and haven't yet found the answer in google.  I don't want to install, just grab some files
2009-02-12T05:40:00.000Z	Pollywog	craigbass1976	there is an option to boot off the disk
2009-02-12T05:41:00.000Z	craigbass1976	Pollywog	disk won't boot; cooked drive
