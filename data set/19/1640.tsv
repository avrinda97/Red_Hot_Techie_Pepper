2010-11-21T12:57:00.000Z	krunal		thoughts?
2010-11-21T12:57:00.000Z	krunal		this is my first time using linux
2010-11-21T12:58:00.000Z	krunal		been a week
2010-11-21T12:59:00.000Z	krunal		yes i hate windows
2010-11-21T13:01:00.000Z	krunal		yeah astropirate ... I really like Ubuntu for this reason - and the fact that it "kinda" feels like mac
2010-11-21T13:03:00.000Z	krunal		does ubuntu support multi touch touch pad?
2010-11-21T13:04:00.000Z	krunal		I have a question...
2010-11-21T13:04:00.000Z	krunal		after spending HOURS configuring ubuntu to get everything working just right... is there a way you can "save" your hardware profiles???
2010-11-21T13:05:00.000Z	iceroot	krunal	hardware-profiles?
2010-11-21T13:05:00.000Z	krunal	iceroot	incase you have to reinstall ubuntu
2010-11-21T13:05:00.000Z	iceroot	krunal	on every start the hardware will be detected again, there is no profile
2010-11-21T13:07:00.000Z	iceroot	krunal	for the drivers you can rebuild the initrd and put the drivers in it
2010-11-21T13:08:00.000Z	krunal	iceroot	i'm sorry I am still a novice user - what do u mean by rebuild the initrd
2010-11-21T13:09:00.000Z	iceroot	krunal	the initrd contains the needed kernel-moduls bevor udev comes up, so putting the moduls (e.g. nvidia in it) then you have a initrd for your system, the problem is, that the initrd can getting very big and only containg modules for your current hardware
2010-11-21T13:10:00.000Z	krunal	iceroot	ah very nice - so how would I do this?
2010-11-21T13:10:00.000Z	iceroot	krunal	sudo update-initramfs -k all -u
2010-11-21T13:12:00.000Z	krunal	iceroot	okay so now terminal is at "update-initramfs: Generating /boot/initrd.img-2.6.35-22-generic-pae
2010-11-21T13:12:00.000Z	krunal	iceroot	i'm assuming i have to wait till it is done
