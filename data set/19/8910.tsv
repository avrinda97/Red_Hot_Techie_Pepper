2007-01-16T08:56:00.000Z	bisho		Anybody is having problems with the nividia drivers after last update (on edgy)?
2007-01-16T08:57:00.000Z	bisho		It says: (EE) Failed to load module "nvidia" (module does not exist, 0)
2007-01-16T08:57:00.000Z	bisho		(EE) No drivers available.
2007-01-16T08:57:00.000Z	PriceChild	bisho	please reinstall your nvidia drivers
2007-01-16T08:57:00.000Z	PriceChild	bisho	we have seen reports of it ont he forums from a very small minority of people... you just need to reinstall nvidia
2007-01-16T08:58:00.000Z	bisho	PriceChild	nvidia-glx?
2007-01-16T08:59:00.000Z	PriceChild	bisho	please follow the guide again, unisntalling and reinstalling your nvidia-glx package
2007-01-16T09:03:00.000Z	bisho	PriceChild	same problem... I have reinstalled nividia-glx, the restricted drivers, and even rebooted
2007-01-16T09:03:00.000Z	PriceChild	bisho	hmmm
2007-01-16T09:04:00.000Z	PriceChild	bisho	no problem... I'm thinking...
2007-01-16T09:14:00.000Z	bisho	PriceChild	I think it could be a problem with paths and where the xorg tries to load the nvidia_drv... See strace at: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/1809/
2007-01-16T09:18:00.000Z	PriceChild	bisho	I'm sorry but that means nothing to me :)
2007-01-16T09:46:00.000Z	bisho	PriceChild	The problem was I was using xserver-xorg-core version 1.1.99.903-1
2007-01-16T09:46:00.000Z	PriceChild	bisho	oh and you need a new version?
2007-01-16T09:46:00.000Z	PriceChild	bisho	ah cool :)
2007-01-16T09:47:00.000Z	PriceChild	bisho	you might have needed to recompile nvidia to get it working...
2007-01-16T09:47:00.000Z	PriceChild	bisho	with new xserver-xorg comes new headers which needs new recompilation of nvidia
2007-01-16T09:52:00.000Z	PriceChild	bisho	yeah we had several people affected a while ago... too many to call it a co-incidence, too little for it to be anything major
2007-01-16T09:53:00.000Z	bisho	PriceChild	maybe only a few people is using edgy-updates
