2005-01-17T07:45:00.000Z	bob2	jintonic_	you can't use sudo with cd
2005-01-17T07:45:00.000Z	bob2	jintonic_	cd isn't a command, it's bulit-in to your shell.  maybe you want 'sudo -s'?
2005-01-17T07:47:00.000Z	bob2	jintonic_	change the mount options to include the option 'umask=002'
2005-01-17T07:51:00.000Z	bob2	jintonic_	you need to add it to the right place...
2005-01-17T07:52:00.000Z	bob2	jintonic_	how are you mounting it?
2005-01-17T10:14:00.000Z	bob2	jintonic_	it's a lot easier to just use X
