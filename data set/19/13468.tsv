2005-03-28T10:32:00.000Z	madstop		and a helluva lot more stuff like that
2005-03-28T10:34:00.000Z	madstop		exactly, kain.  I can't believe it.  I'm lost without bbc radio 4, dammit.  Back to windows till I can resolve this.  Or back to warty.
2005-03-28T10:35:00.000Z	madstop		I'm amazed I haven't seen this issue raised on this channel before, I've been reading everything here about hoary
2005-03-28T10:36:00.000Z	madstop		I don't know kain, I can try opening the url in there, but I think I need the firefox realplay plugin... hmmm
2005-03-28T10:37:00.000Z	madstop		just thought of something-- maybe I can try copying the realplayer folders from warty on my other computer to this one...
2005-03-28T10:37:00.000Z	madstop		think that might work...?
2005-03-28T10:39:00.000Z	madstop		thanks thoreauputic , kain.  I will, but this strikes me as impracticable, since, unfortunately many radio sites force realplay based applets on us
2005-03-28T10:39:00.000Z	geneo93	madstop	 boycot them then
2005-03-30T09:41:00.000Z	geneo93	madstop	 just kde and that gives you all you need
2005-03-30T09:43:00.000Z	madstop	geneo93	believe it or not, I don't see any "just kde" packages here -- unless you mean all this stuff with the languages listed; I thought all that was documentation
2005-03-30T09:44:00.000Z	geneo93	madstop	 all i did was apt-get install kde
2005-03-30T09:45:00.000Z	geneo93	madstop	 np
2005-03-30T10:42:00.000Z	geneo93	madstop	 my windows key brings up menu
2005-03-30T10:42:00.000Z	madstop	geneo93	it used to for me too, pre-kubuntu
2005-04-02T11:59:00.000Z	geneo93	madstop	 i prefer lilo myself
2005-04-02T11:59:00.000Z	madstop	geneo93	i was afraid you'd say that...
