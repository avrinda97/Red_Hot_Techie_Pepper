2005-05-03T10:51:00.000Z	SeamusLP		Hey guys, in related news, gcc 4.0 is out and it's supposed to give C++ a 40% performance boost.  Good for you kde users I suppose ;)
2005-05-03T10:51:00.000Z	SeamusLP		Also there are some optimizations that are supposed to speed up C as well -- so you may even notice a difference in gnome.
2005-05-03T10:52:00.000Z	sobersabre	SeamusLP	this 40% sounds ... too much.
2005-05-03T10:54:00.000Z	sobersabre	SeamusLP	wtf are you talking about...  sorry for roughness.
2005-05-03T10:54:00.000Z	sobersabre	SeamusLP	what is the connection between file size and the performance ?
2005-05-03T10:54:00.000Z	SeamusLP	sobersabre	 GCC 4.0 is out.  It has great optimizations for C++.  This translates into a faster KDE.
2005-05-03T10:55:00.000Z	SeamusLP	sobersabre	 Boot times?  KDE does take a little while to boot.
2005-05-03T10:55:00.000Z	sobersabre	SeamusLP	it is fine.. just don't through such excessive numbers
2005-05-03T10:55:00.000Z	SeamusLP	sobersabre	 I said 40% smaller libraries :P that's not a made-up number
2005-05-03T10:56:00.000Z	sobersabre	SeamusLP	Hey guys, in related news, gcc 4.0 is out and it's supposed to give C++ a 40% performance boost.  Good for you kde users I suppose ;)
2005-05-03T10:56:00.000Z	SeamusLP	sobersabre	 Did I not correct myself?
2005-05-03T10:56:00.000Z	sobersabre	SeamusLP	Err, sorry, the filesize will be 40% smaller
2005-05-03T10:57:00.000Z	SeamusLP	sobersabre	 lib filesize.
2005-05-03T10:57:00.000Z	SeamusLP	sobersabre	 This should improve startup times :P
2005-05-03T10:58:00.000Z	sobersabre	SeamusLP	if all the system is built upon this gcc. can it link with older libs ?
2005-05-03T10:58:00.000Z	SeamusLP	sobersabre	 Supposedly.  I compiled a few programs with GCC4 and had no problems with the old libraries.  But by no means did I test this extensively.
2005-05-03T10:59:00.000Z	sobersabre	SeamusLP	you know what major ver. number change in gcc means to the system ?
2005-05-03T11:00:00.000Z	SeamusLP	sobersabre	mjr:  You guys should check out #ubuntu-motu, those guys in there have more experience compiling with GCC4.  They've been doing it for about a month now.
2005-05-03T11:01:00.000Z	SeamusLP	sobersabre	 It's a requirement, you know, since breezy will be 100% gcc4 from what I've heard ;)
