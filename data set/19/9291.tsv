2006-11-30T10:46:00.000Z	Pie-rate		Question: in your opinion, what is the best music/media player utility (winamp-like?) to use with linux?
2006-11-30T10:47:00.000Z	Pie-rate		Ok, i'll look into that after i get fglrx working
2006-11-30T10:48:00.000Z	Pelo	Pie-rate	 I like rhythmbox but I am not very demanding
2006-11-30T10:55:00.000Z	Pelo	Pie-rate	 reboot
2007-04-25T10:07:00.000Z	Pelo	Pie-rate	  devede
2007-08-31T09:18:00.000Z	Pelo	Pie-rate	 I suspect i over-writes
2007-08-31T09:21:00.000Z	Pelo	Pie-rate	usualy in text editors when you want to save to another name you use save as
2007-08-31T09:22:00.000Z	Pie-rate	Pelo	but an autosave feature designed to keep your document backed up in case of power failure or crash should not overwrite.
2007-08-31T09:22:00.000Z	Pelo	Pie-rate	 most autosave I've seen save to the same file
2007-08-31T09:23:00.000Z	Pie-rate	Pelo	for example, openoffice has a "document recovery" feature
2007-08-31T09:37:00.000Z	Pelo	Pie-rate	 because there are to many possibly variotions on the size of / and of /home
2007-08-31T09:38:00.000Z	Pie-rate	Pelo	so have the system pick one, or develop a tool that dynamically resizes them.
2007-08-31T09:38:00.000Z	Pelo	Pie-rate	 do other distros automaticaly do it ?
2007-08-31T09:38:00.000Z	Pie-rate	Pelo	i don't know, but it would be a good idea.
2007-08-31T09:39:00.000Z	Pelo	Pie-rate	I'm sure there is a suggestion box somewhere
2007-08-31T09:39:00.000Z	Pie-rate	Pelo	yeah. there's launchpad.
2007-09-27T07:14:00.000Z	Pelo	Pie-rate	then use  native linux apps instead of MS apps running on wine, or go back to windows
2007-09-27T07:16:00.000Z	Pie-rate	Pelo	hmm, well there's this little problem that windows costs $200, randomly fails, is susceptible to hundreds of vulnerabilities, has built-in DRM in newer versions, is ugly, and isn't configurable.
2007-09-27T07:16:00.000Z	Pie-rate	Pelo	the sound is great though!
