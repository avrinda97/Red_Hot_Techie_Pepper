2006-12-07T09:30:00.000Z	dsnyders	Lovloss	what were you running them with before?  And what did you do between?
2006-12-07T09:30:00.000Z	Lovloss		uive tried multiple dvds  :<
2006-12-07T09:31:00.000Z	Lovloss		Ive done a lot between with packages, no idea
2006-12-07T09:31:00.000Z	Lovloss		I believe it went wrong when i installed xgl
2006-12-07T09:32:00.000Z	dsnyders	Lovloss	What dvd players do you have installed?
2006-12-07T09:32:00.000Z	Lovloss		I have vlc, ogle, totem, and gxine
2006-12-07T09:32:00.000Z	Lovloss		Not a single one of them work
2006-12-07T09:33:00.000Z	dsnyders	Lovloss	Do you have room to download/try mplayer?
2006-12-07T09:33:00.000Z	Lovloss		I installed mplayer yesterday because i was trying to encode a video to flash - didnt work out.
2006-12-07T09:34:00.000Z	Lovloss		I dunno whats wrong with my compy at this point. I manually apt-get installed a lot of stuff
2006-12-07T09:36:00.000Z	dsnyders	Lovloss	well, I've never had luck with totem.  Have you looked in your log files for error or warning messages?
2006-12-07T09:36:00.000Z	Lovloss	dsnyders	no... i havent gotten any error messages
2006-12-07T09:37:00.000Z	dsnyders	Lovloss	I'm stumped.  Perhaps doing an uninstall/reinstall of your playback software?
2006-12-07T09:38:00.000Z	Lovloss		I guess so... i think ive messed this thing up from farting around without even understanding command line
2006-12-07T09:39:00.000Z	dsnyders	Lovloss	With the command line comes much power, and much responsibility
