2005-06-22T09:26:00.000Z	Madpilot		quick question: should my CD drives be "owned" by root?
2005-06-22T09:28:00.000Z	mcking	Madpilot	ah
2005-06-22T09:27:00.000Z	mcking	Madpilot	the cdrom drives are symlinks to the actual device, which should be owned by root:cdrom
2005-06-22T09:28:00.000Z	Madpilot	mcking	OK, just checking. Neither of my CD drives are auto-mounting anymore, so I'm trying to check their settings...
2005-06-22T09:29:00.000Z	mcking	Madpilot	is you user in the right group?
2005-06-22T09:29:00.000Z	Madpilot	mcking	I think so. Everything else still works - Synaptic, sudo, etc
2005-06-22T09:30:00.000Z	mcking	Madpilot	go to the users and groups app in the system->admin menu and make sure that the "access cdrom drives" and "can use external drives immediately" boxes are checked
2005-06-22T09:31:00.000Z	mcking	Madpilot	also make sure gnome-volume-manager is running
2005-06-22T09:32:00.000Z	Madpilot	mcking	gnome-volume-mngr is running, and my settings in users & groups all seem correct.
2005-06-22T09:32:00.000Z	mcking	Madpilot	hrm, does a usb pen dirve work?
2005-06-22T09:33:00.000Z	Madpilot	mcking	I don't own one... just a sec, will check to see what happens w/ my floppy drive...
2005-06-22T09:35:00.000Z	Madpilot	mcking	no automount with my floppy drive, either - that should be automounting as well, right? (can you tell I don't use the floppy much?)
2005-06-22T09:35:00.000Z	mcking	Madpilot	i haven't used one in years  ;)
2005-06-22T09:36:00.000Z	Madpilot	mcking	I keep my floppy drive for old time's sake... :) and because I don't have a USB pendrive quite yet...
2005-06-22T09:36:00.000Z	mcking	Madpilot	i couldn't exist without a pendrive
2005-06-22T09:37:00.000Z	Madpilot	mcking	I'm just waiting for the price to drop a bit more... and until I get around to installing front USB ports on my box!
2005-06-22T09:38:00.000Z	mcking	Madpilot	I have a keyboard with usb ports on it
2005-06-22T09:38:00.000Z	mcking	Madpilot	Viewsonic ku709
2005-06-22T09:40:00.000Z	Madpilot	mcking	very cool. I'm (slowly) building a front panel into a spare 5.25" drive bay cover - USB, audio, switches for the lights, etc
