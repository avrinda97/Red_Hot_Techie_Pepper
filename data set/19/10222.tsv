2006-07-31T07:34:00.000Z	Strife		does anyone have experience correcting filesystems with errors?
2006-07-31T07:34:00.000Z	dmsantam	Strife	fsck does
2006-07-31T07:35:00.000Z	dmsantam	Strife	use fsck -a to start
2006-07-31T07:35:00.000Z	Strife	dmsantam	right, except that everytime I run e2fsck it keeps telling me the fs has errors
2006-07-31T07:35:00.000Z	dmsantam	Strife	you tried fsck -a? what is the output
2006-07-31T07:36:00.000Z	Strife	dmsantam	I don't even know what the -a option is... I am using e2fsck besides
2006-07-31T07:36:00.000Z	dmsantam	Strife	fsck -a
2006-07-31T07:36:00.000Z	dmsantam	Strife	try it please
2006-07-31T07:36:00.000Z	Strife	dmsantam	I'm not running that without knowing what it does
2006-07-31T07:37:00.000Z	Strife	dmsantam	it's the same as e2fsck -p, actually
2006-07-31T07:37:00.000Z	Strife	dmsantam	but I don't really know what "preen" means
2006-07-31T07:37:00.000Z	dmsantam	Strife	e2fsck has -a but its deprecated
2006-07-31T07:38:00.000Z	dmsantam	Strife	then go off and read something that will convince you that it isn't bad. coz you clearly don't believe me
2006-07-31T07:39:00.000Z	dmsantam	Strife	once you're convinced, and you've run it, and it doesn't work (if it doesn't rather), then come back and paste the output
2006-07-31T07:39:00.000Z	Strife	dmsantam	I have been looking for information, but I haven't found any yet... if you happen to have a link handy that would explain to me what it does, I'd appreciate it
2006-07-31T07:54:00.000Z	Strife	dmsantam	ok, I ran e2fsck -p despite still not finding out what it really does... see http://main.zgib.net/~mvd/fsck-error
2006-07-31T07:56:00.000Z	dmsantam	Strife	looks like it. and you tried "e2fsck" without any options?
2006-07-31T07:56:00.000Z	Strife	dmsantam	yes
2006-07-31T07:56:00.000Z	dmsantam	Strife	what was its output?
