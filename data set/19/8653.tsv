2007-02-27T11:14:00.000Z	ikonia_	teeL	what do you mean
2007-02-27T11:15:00.000Z	ikonia_	teeL	setup what
2007-02-27T11:16:00.000Z	ikonia_	teeL	you shouldn't have to - you should get it via dhcp from your DSL provider
2007-02-27T11:17:00.000Z	ikonia_	teeL	ahhh ok - so your not getting anything configured on your network card?
2007-02-27T11:17:00.000Z	ikonia_	teeL	thats a totally different think to what you asked
2007-02-27T11:18:00.000Z	ikonia_	teeL	I don't have a guide for setting up an adblock server
2007-02-27T11:20:00.000Z	ikonia_	teeL	oooh you want other users to proxy out of it
2007-02-27T11:21:00.000Z	teeL	ikonia_	Yes :D You know how to do that?
2007-02-27T11:21:00.000Z	ikonia_	teeL	you need to look up ip_forwarding or masqurading with iptables
2007-02-27T11:22:00.000Z	teeL	ikonia_	Ok thanks
2007-03-01T07:25:00.000Z	ikonia_	teeL	drag and drop - or use Karmera or something like that
2007-03-01T07:26:00.000Z	teeL	ikonia_	its a server without a monitor.
2007-03-01T07:26:00.000Z	ikonia_	teeL	not really then, you'd have to script it
2007-03-01T07:26:00.000Z	teeL	ikonia_	aw ok
2007-03-01T09:56:00.000Z	ikonia_	teeL	not a problem
2007-03-02T07:18:00.000Z	ikonia_	teeL	I don't believe so unless its a video camera
2007-03-02T07:19:00.000Z	teeL	ikonia_	: It can record video too =p
2007-03-02T07:19:00.000Z	ikonia_	teeL	but can it stream video - most cameas can't
