2012-10-06T01:12:00.000Z	crazydip		source control is one of those things that once you get used to it, you wonder how insane it was when you did not have it
2012-10-06T01:12:00.000Z	gordonjcp	crazydip	yup
2012-10-06T01:12:00.000Z	gordonjcp	crazydip	and when it saves your backside...
2012-10-06T02:04:00.000Z	gordonjcp	crazydip	why would you want a GUI for a source control system?
2012-10-06T02:04:00.000Z	gordonjcp	crazydip	I mean, how would you represent that in a GUI?
2012-10-06T02:07:00.000Z	crazydip	gordonjcp	gui is really nice for example when looking at the log/history - i love bzr-explorer but don't like any git gui
2012-10-06T02:08:00.000Z	gordonjcp	crazydip	how does that work?
2012-10-06T02:11:00.000Z	crazydip	gordonjcp	i'm not sure what your question is - if you wan't to see it (and you use bzr) just install bzr-explorer - for git it's git-cola but i don't think it's that great so not sure if i'll use it
2012-10-06T02:11:00.000Z	gordonjcp	crazydip	well, I don't know how you'd have a GUI for version control
2012-10-06T02:11:00.000Z	gordonjcp	crazydip	it just kind of doesn't make sense to me
2012-10-06T02:12:00.000Z	crazydip	gordonjcp	makes sense to me, if its a good gui :) for what i need out of bzr, bzr-explorer has me covered

2012-10-06T02:20:00.000Z	crazydip	gordonjcp	in case you're interested, bzr for git users (i'm reading up on git for bzr users): http://doc.bazaar.canonical.com/migration/en/survival/bzr-for-git-users.html
2012-10-10T02:22:00.000Z	gordonjcp	crazydip	it keeps the really lazy skript kiddies out
2012-10-10T02:22:00.000Z	crazydip	gordonjcp	aye
2012-10-10T02:21:00.000Z	gordonjcp	crazydip	eh, I've found it quietens things down a bit
2012-10-10T02:23:00.000Z	crazydip	gordonjcp	bigbill : if you intend to use password on server, a much better option than changing port is to setup fail2ban
2012-10-10T02:26:00.000Z	gordonjcp	crazydip	yup
