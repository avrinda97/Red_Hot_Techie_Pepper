2007-06-29T14:12:00.000Z	Flannel	niuq	netbeans is in the repositories, in multiverse.  Just install the package.
2007-06-29T14:13:00.000Z	niuq	Flannel	i tried netbeans5.5    but this appeared at the end
2007-06-29T14:15:00.000Z	niuq	Flannel	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/27731/
2007-06-29T14:16:00.000Z	Flannel	niuq	oh, how... odd.
2007-06-29T14:17:00.000Z	niuq	Flannel	then i tried to install that package and when i run it appears JDK IS NOT FOUND
2007-06-29T14:18:00.000Z	niuq	Flannel	then i install jdk, and try again and the same
2007-11-23T11:22:00.000Z	Flannel	niuq	Why telnet?  use ssh
2007-11-23T11:22:00.000Z	niuq	Flannel	it's a practice
2007-11-23T11:23:00.000Z	Flannel	niuq	SSH is easy as install the openssh-server package.  And I strongly recommend it over telnet.
2007-11-23T11:24:00.000Z	niuq	Flannel	i have to install telnet, it's like a homework
2007-11-23T11:24:00.000Z	niuq	Flannel	i might use ssh for a real environment
2007-11-23T11:24:00.000Z	Flannel	niuq	wait, telnet server? or telnet client?
2007-11-23T11:24:00.000Z	niuq	Flannel	client
2007-11-23T11:24:00.000Z	Flannel	niuq	Oh.  Its already installed.  telnet.
2007-11-23T11:24:00.000Z	niuq	Flannel	and server?
2007-11-23T11:25:00.000Z	Flannel	niuq	uh, I guess.... telnetd.  Its in universe.
2007-11-23T11:26:00.000Z	niuq	Flannel	thanks
2007-11-23T11:36:00.000Z	niuq	Flannel	ok, now how i start the telnet service?
