2011-08-25T19:20:00.000Z	user_564		Can anyone help me...How can I reinstall last updates?
2011-08-25T19:20:00.000Z	contrast	user_564	what did you delete?
2011-08-25T19:23:00.000Z	contrast	user_564	which are you using, chrome or chromium? and can you pastebin the error you're getting from it?
2011-08-25T19:31:00.000Z	contrast	user_564	you still didn't give me the info i asked for which is kinda necessary to troubleshoot your issue
2011-08-25T19:35:00.000Z	contrast	user_564	you should never delete files outside of your home directory unless you know 110% what you're doing. just for future reference. ;-)
2011-08-25T19:37:00.000Z	contrast	user_564	ahh, ok... well that's good then.
2011-08-25T19:38:00.000Z	contrast	user_564	i would probably just completely remove chromium and chrome in software center, then install them again. that should bring back in whatever dependencies you got rid of.
2011-08-25T19:47:00.000Z	contrast	user_564	erm, you (or the user management gui) must have accidentally removed you from the sudo group in the process
2011-08-25T19:54:00.000Z	contrast	user_564	do you have "sun-java6-plugin" installed?
2011-08-25T19:57:00.000Z	contrast	user_564	to see if a package is installed: "apt-cache policy <package>" (that shows the availble versions and which, if any, are installed) or "dpkg --get-selections | grep <package>"
2011-08-25T20:00:00.000Z	contrast	user_564	now *there* is some useful output. which release of ubuntu are you on?
2011-08-25T20:02:00.000Z	contrast	user_564	can you pastebin the output from this command: dpkg --get-selections | grep flash
2011-08-25T20:04:00.000Z	contrast	user_564	"ALL" ?
2011-08-25T20:08:00.000Z	contrast	user_564	have you tried moving your chrome user data folder and seeing how it does with a clean profile? (you should have a folder like ~/.chrome, ~/.google/chrome, ~/.config/chrome or ~/.config/google/chrome - try renaming it to chrome-OLD)
2011-08-25T20:10:00.000Z	contrast	user_564	if you already tried deleting it and got the same problem on a clean chrome profile, then no
2011-08-25T20:13:00.000Z	contrast	user_564	just so people don't misunderstand you (as i did), you may want to start saying "uninstalled" instead of "deleted" ;)
2011-08-25T20:17:00.000Z	contrast	user_564	sorry, but i'm pretty much at a loss... you might post your issue on the forums (with all relevant details) and see if anyone there can figure out what's wrong
