2009-11-27T02:29:00.000Z	acicula	gdiz	log in using the -X flag, lets you start gui aps remotely
2010-01-09T07:15:00.000Z	acicula	gdiz	permissions probably
2010-01-09T07:15:00.000Z	acicula	gdiz	can whatever handles the nfs stuff write locally?
2010-01-09T07:15:00.000Z	gdiz	acicula	yeah no problem
2010-01-09T07:20:00.000Z	gdiz	acicula	I had chmod'd the directory.  Is there anything else I could do on the ubuntu end or should that be it?
2010-01-09T07:21:00.000Z	acicula	gdiz	if you cant write its either a failed authentication to the nfs daemon or whatever it uses for authentication  or not enough write permissions(owner,group or worldwide)
2010-01-09T07:21:00.000Z	acicula	gdiz	other then that i dont know
2010-01-09T07:22:00.000Z	gdiz	acicula	real quick what authentication is there for nfs
2010-01-09T07:22:00.000Z	acicula	gdiz	not a clue, probably involves portmap?
2010-01-09T07:23:00.000Z	gdiz	acicula	thanks
2010-01-16T02:58:00.000Z	acicula	gdiz	force all files to be created with read only permissions
2010-01-16T02:59:00.000Z	gdiz	acicula	is there a way to force any file added via samba to be set with read only permissions on ubuntu
2010-01-16T02:59:00.000Z	acicula	gdiz	yeah you can set a default user and permissions with which a faile is create
2010-01-16T03:00:00.000Z	gdiz	acicula	I don't think I follow, would you be able to give me an example
2010-01-16T03:02:00.000Z	acicula	gdiz	you have to specify a share in samba and specify the userid and permissions to use for that particular share, i dont have a ctrl-c and  ctrl-v example for you, google and man smb.conf
2010-01-16T03:03:00.000Z	gdiz	acicula	oh, so I do this via smb.conf?
2010-01-16T03:03:00.000Z	gdiz	acicula	I think I get it now
2010-01-16T03:03:00.000Z	acicula	gdiz	think so, not sure how nautilus share folder interacts with samba, but since you want something specific the best way to go is via smb.conf
2010-01-16T03:04:00.000Z	gdiz	acicula	got it, I I will go searching on google
