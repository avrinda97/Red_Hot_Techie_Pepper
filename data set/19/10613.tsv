2006-06-25T14:07:00.000Z	Ng	pekay	the kernel is saying it doesn't recognise the filesystem on that "disk"
2006-06-25T14:08:00.000Z	pekay	Ng	it used to work fine :/

2006-06-25T14:08:00.000Z	Ng	pekay	have you reformatted it recently?
2006-06-25T14:09:00.000Z	Ng	pekay	when you have finished using the stick, do you just pull it out? or "eject" it first?
2006-06-25T14:09:00.000Z	pekay	Ng	eeer, i must have pulled it out :/
2006-06-25T14:10:00.000Z	Ng	pekay	yeah, you really really don't want to do that - you've probably corrupted the filesystem on it. instead you should right click on its icon on the desktop and choose "eject"
2006-06-25T14:12:00.000Z	pekay	Ng	aff, but, when I was on Mandriva, this happened, i formatted in Windows to FAT again, same problems..
2006-06-25T14:13:00.000Z	Ng	pekay	hmm. perhaps see if windows can read it now?
2006-06-25T14:13:00.000Z	pekay	Ng	mmm alright
2006-06-25T15:01:00.000Z	pekay	Ng	are you there?
