2008-01-18T15:09:00.000Z	joot	Sterling	do you have windows installed?
2008-01-18T15:10:00.000Z	joot	Sterling	Are you using the ubuntu live cd??
2008-01-18T15:12:00.000Z	joot	Sterling	Why do you not use the guided resize option ubuntu is not greedy and will leave plenty for windows
2008-01-18T15:13:00.000Z	joot	Sterling	If you defragged window before you start then the guided resize will be ok for you
2008-01-18T15:16:00.000Z	joot	Sterling	you should see a slider showing your ntfs (windows) at around 60 percent at the balance for ubuntu
2008-01-18T15:16:00.000Z	joot	Sterling	you should see a slider showing your ntfs (windows) at around 60 percent at the balance for ubuntu
2008-01-18T15:17:00.000Z	joot	Sterling	If you move the slider left you will make windows partion smaller
