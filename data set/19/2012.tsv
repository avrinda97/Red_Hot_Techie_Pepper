2011-07-02T05:55:00.000Z	vandemar	Monotoko	is there some reason you can't just leave the computer on?
2011-07-02T06:02:00.000Z	Monotoko	vandemar	I wouldn't feel comfortable leaving it on for a span of days...it gets pretty warm and crashes
2011-07-02T06:29:00.000Z	Monotoko	vandemar	even with having to buy it?
2011-07-02T06:19:00.000Z	vandemar	Monotoko	computers are not supposed to crash if left on.  Either your hardware is broken or your case isn't cooled well, or the computer's in a hot environment with no AC
2011-07-02T06:22:00.000Z	Monotoko	vandemar	it's an ancient computer, from 2002...it crashes and it crashes a lot. I only use it to run cron jobs anyway
2011-07-02T06:22:00.000Z	vandemar	Monotoko	can you get a cheap low-power embedded computer (even a wireless gateway would suffice... buffalo wifi are cheap at $65-70 and have lots of flash and ram) and run the cronjobs from that?
2011-07-02T06:23:00.000Z	vandemar	Monotoko	since you got the computer, have you reapplied thermal compound and reseated the cpu cooler and gotten rid of dust
2011-07-02T06:24:00.000Z	vandemar	Monotoko	and have you run memtest86 overnight?
2011-07-02T06:24:00.000Z	Monotoko	vandemar	most likely...it's usually fine, it's just on a really warm day it gets too warm...and were in the middle of summer :P
2011-07-02T06:26:00.000Z	vandemar	Monotoko	is the cron stuff specific to that computer or could any computer do it without much trouble
2011-07-02T06:27:00.000Z	vandemar	Monotoko	even if the NIC/bios supports wake on lan, you'd need another computer on the LAN to wake it up...
2011-07-02T06:27:00.000Z	Monotoko	vandemar	I think any computer could do it...however I'm in the process of implimenting the link quin gave me which involves setting a timer
2011-07-02T06:27:00.000Z	vandemar	Monotoko	the only other option I can think of is some sort of telephone-controlled power switch, if you have a landline
2011-07-02T06:28:00.000Z	vandemar	Monotoko	but that would be more expensive than an embedded low-power system like a wireless gateway
2011-07-02T06:31:00.000Z	Monotoko	vandemar	I did at one point try to hack the router my ISP have given us...but with no luck
2011-07-02T06:31:00.000Z	vandemar	Monotoko	I meant the telephone power switch.  even LAN (web-based) power switches (turn on/off power sockets) would cost $100ish or more
2011-07-02T06:32:00.000Z	Monotoko	vandemar	but I can program it to switch on after a timer in the OS itself using ACPI: http://blog.gulfsoft.com/2010/05/scheduled-wakeup-in-ubuntu.html
2011-07-02T06:33:00.000Z	vandemar	Monotoko	if that works, that's really cool.  I've always regarded desktop power management stuff as unreliable, maybe it's reliable these days
