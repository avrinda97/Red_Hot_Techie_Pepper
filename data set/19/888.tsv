2011-08-01T12:05:00.000Z	stealz		I am running dual monitors and have some flash issues: When going full screen, Flash Videos open on monitor A with resolution of Monitor B. Is there any way to have them use the appropriate resolution for the appropriate monitor
2011-08-01T12:06:00.000Z	theadmin	stealz	It's Flash, nothing you can do, it's buggy
2011-08-01T12:06:00.000Z	theadmin	stealz	Wait for Adobe to fix it, unlikely though
2011-08-11T09:20:00.000Z	theadmin	stealz	yay Arch xD
2011-08-11T09:20:00.000Z	stealz	theadmin	I have no clue about arch =)
2011-08-11T09:21:00.000Z	stealz	theadmin	its just the only clue I could find so far
2011-08-11T09:21:00.000Z	theadmin	stealz	Ah
2011-08-11T09:34:00.000Z	theadmin	stealz	^
2011-08-11T19:48:00.000Z	theadmin	stealz	I got sound to work in wine using "padsp" before
2011-08-11T19:48:00.000Z	theadmin	stealz	Try that
2011-08-11T19:48:00.000Z	stealz	theadmin	thanks
2011-08-11T19:50:00.000Z	stealz	theadmin	I'm just reading on a forum about padsp, and it seems I also need to use it on winecfg, but I dont know where to put it... I just type padsp winecfg in a terminal? or will that just run another instance of it?
2011-08-11T19:51:00.000Z	stealz	theadmin	putting it in the launcher alone didnt work
2011-08-11T19:51:00.000Z	theadmin	stealz	I think that'd do, yeah
2011-08-11T19:53:00.000Z	stealz	theadmin	nope, still no result :( the only thing that worked so far was disabling pulse by doing killall pulseaudio and then editing etc/pulse to disable autolaunch, but that causes a lot of other problems
2011-08-11T19:53:00.000Z	stealz	theadmin	I also tried switching to OSS Sound
2011-08-11T19:54:00.000Z	theadmin	stealz	Oh... Well, sad... I don't think I could help more than that. Well I tried.
2011-08-11T19:54:00.000Z	stealz	theadmin	ok, thanks anyways
2011-08-26T16:08:00.000Z	theadmin	stealz	There is a virtual character map preinstalled, gucharmap
