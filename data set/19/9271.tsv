2006-12-01T15:06:00.000Z	RoC_MM_0w		I don't use Ubuntu, but my question could be applicable to Ubuntu if I choose to use it.  I current have a HD install of KNOPPIX, and my drive died.  I got a new drive (for now, it's a totally diff size and geometry), and moved my files onto it.  All the files copied, and now when I run "grub-install", I never get a working bootloader.  I've even dd'ed my old 446byte grub into the mbr manually, and all I get is a "cha cha cha cha cha"
2006-12-01T15:06:00.000Z	RoC_MM_0w		 out of the floppy drive, even though it can't be the BIOS booting the floppy, and grub does not have a floppy config.   Could it be my stage1/stge2 that I havwe to delete to get them regerneated?
2006-12-01T15:08:00.000Z	RoC_MM_0w		Anybody catch that?
2006-12-01T15:09:00.000Z	soundray	RoC_MM_0w	it came through
2006-12-01T15:09:00.000Z	soundray	RoC_MM_0w	did you take care to make exact copies of the device files etc.?
2006-12-01T15:10:00.000Z	RoC_MM_0w	soundray	oh yes...I tarballed all of /
2006-12-01T15:11:00.000Z	soundray	RoC_MM_0w	confusing that it should try to access the floppy.
2006-12-01T15:12:00.000Z	soundray	RoC_MM_0w	from what context did you run grub-install?
2006-12-01T15:12:00.000Z	RoC_MM_0w	soundray	it was chroot /mnt/hda1 grub-install /dev/hda (from a KNOPPIX offline environment)
2006-12-01T15:13:00.000Z	RoC_MM_0w	soundray	the command has worked flawlessly numerous times before.
2006-12-01T15:13:00.000Z	soundray	RoC_MM_0w	with /boot/grub/ in place in /mnt/hda1 I assume?
2006-12-01T15:14:00.000Z	soundray	RoC_MM_0w	I know what I would do.
2006-12-01T15:14:00.000Z	soundray	RoC_MM_0w	get the new install booted somehow, perhaps with Super Grub Disk or a tool like that. Then run grub-install from there.
2006-12-01T15:15:00.000Z	RoC_MM_0w	soundray	is super grub disk more than just a simple linux bootcd with grub?  It would be nice to have something smarter or more helpful.
2006-12-01T15:16:00.000Z	soundray	RoC_MM_0w	I haven't used it myself, but once you manage to boot grub (any grub, could even be a floppy one), you can do 'find', 'geometry', 'kernel', 'boot' etc from the command line.
2006-12-01T15:16:00.000Z	RoC_MM_0w	soundray	this super grub disk looks interesting, I will try it out right away.
2006-12-01T15:17:00.000Z	soundray	RoC_MM_0w	hope it helps.
2006-12-01T15:18:00.000Z	RoC_MM_0w	soundray	if I was using Ubuntu, and I moved my system to a new drive, does the ubuntu livecd have a tool to fix my mbr?
2006-12-01T15:19:00.000Z	soundray	RoC_MM_0w	yes, and there is a set of instructions to do it (because Windows installation routinely messes up grub)
