2010-06-05T19:54:00.000Z	slops_	kevin009	i did a fresh install of 9.10 and have a mouse pointer but no mouse it does not work
2010-06-05T19:54:00.000Z	kevin009		is it a usb mouse?
2010-06-05T19:54:00.000Z	kevin009	slops_	is it a usb mouse? if it is, try running lsusb in a terminal and seeing if anything about a mouse shows up
2010-06-05T19:54:00.000Z	slops_	kevin009	i am using a usb mouse that going through a kvm anc comining out as ps2
2010-06-05T19:55:00.000Z	slops_	kevin009	the mouse works on my 10.4 desktop and my win 7 box
2010-06-05T19:55:00.000Z	slops_	kevin009	just not on this box
2010-06-05T19:55:00.000Z	kevin009	slops_	have you tried powering down after connecting it? i don't think ps/2 is hotpluggable and it doesn't work until you restart, which is a pain. i have a usb kvm and it works great

2010-06-05T19:57:00.000Z	slops_	kevin009	i think its something on this box
2010-06-05T19:57:00.000Z	slops_	kevin009	as the mouse works on others
2010-06-05T19:57:00.000Z	kevin009	slops_	perhaps someone else can help then. i'm not sure what to do. you may want to try googling "ubuntu ps/2 kvm" and seeing if anything comes up
2010-06-05T19:58:00.000Z	slops_	kevin009	i have
