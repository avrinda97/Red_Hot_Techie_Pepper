2011-09-18T14:56:00.000Z	guest665		hi all, just wondering if anyone can help with sed awk grep? im looking for a one-liner to shirt the last char of a line to the front of the line
2011-09-18T14:57:00.000Z	jrib	guest665	why would you want to do this?  Sounds like homework...
2011-09-18T15:00:00.000Z	guest665	jrib	awk sed | something else ?
2011-09-18T15:00:00.000Z	jrib	guest665	you don't need anything other than bash
2011-09-18T15:01:00.000Z	jrib	guest665	I will be less cryptic for you: bash substring
2011-09-18T15:05:00.000Z	jrib	guest665	really it doesn't make sense to use sed for this...
2011-09-18T15:06:00.000Z	guest665	jrib	please explain
2011-09-18T15:06:00.000Z	jrib	guest665	you're using regular expressions to extract substrings given by position.  Kind of silly
2011-09-18T15:07:00.000Z	guest665	jrib	so what make sense to you
2011-09-18T15:08:00.000Z	jrib	guest665	you know the old joke about regular expressions? "Some people, when confronted with a problem, think 'I know, I'll use regular expressions.'   Now they have two problems." Anyway, it's fine but I would suggest you just use bash's ability to extract substrings.  Here is an example: foo="this is a line"; echo ${foo:3:5} .  There's some documentation here if you want:
2011-09-18T15:13:00.000Z	guest665	jrib	thanks for the link, how would you # cat file | swap last to first.
2011-09-18T15:14:00.000Z	jrib	guest665	http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/001
2011-09-18T15:18:00.000Z	jrib	guest665	did you figure out how to do what you asked on a line using bash?  Or are you not really interested?
2011-09-18T15:21:00.000Z	guest665	jrib	still not working as expected, but working on it! if you have a solution / example i am very interested!
2011-09-18T15:21:00.000Z	jrib	guest665	what are you trying?
2011-09-18T15:24:00.000Z	jrib	guest665	if you take the time to read about bash substring extraction, the answer should be pretty straightforward...
2011-09-18T15:25:00.000Z	jrib	guest665	but llutz_'s sed solution should work too... it's just not as pure as I would like :P
2011-09-18T15:26:00.000Z	guest665	jrib	so what is your example, im reading but not getting it yet ;)
2011-09-18T15:28:00.000Z	jrib	guest665	I gave my example: foo="this is a line"; echo ${foo:3:5}.   That gives you substring starting at 3 and taking 5 characters.  But you want "last character" + "first character to second to last character".  So you now have 2 substrings that you need to figure out how to extract
