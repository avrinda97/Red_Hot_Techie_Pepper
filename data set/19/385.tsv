2012-03-13T10:58:00.000Z	samster34		so, it seems I can't successfully run or install any kind of linux on this computer, while windows works fine.
2012-03-13T11:00:00.000Z	samster34		??
2012-03-13T11:02:00.000Z	samster34		well, I guess since linux tries very hard not to run, I'll just have to use windows
2012-03-13T11:02:00.000Z	samster34		?
2012-03-13T11:03:00.000Z	samster34		there is no windows currently on the computer
2012-03-13T11:03:00.000Z	samster34		but it ran win7 for months before
2012-03-13T11:04:00.000Z	samster34		I've tried ubuntu 12, 10, mint, fedora, debian...
2012-03-13T11:05:00.000Z	samster34		mint I could actually get to launch in text mode, and start X from there, then proceed to install it, but the installed one wont even launch into text mode...
2012-03-13T11:06:00.000Z	samster34		it's a little frustrating, seeing how all the versions I've tried work flawlessly on my main computer
2012-03-13T11:07:00.000Z	root________	samster34	what can you tell us about the specs?  Have you some older distros?  old slack, puppy, or even an archaic debian or ubuntu ?
2012-03-13T11:09:00.000Z	root________	samster34	Hmm.  it should just work.  try editing the command line and removing quiet splash and see if it hangs up on any particular step to isolate the problem.
2012-03-13T11:11:00.000Z	root________	samster34	I'm thinking either one small piece of bad hardware, or an incompatible setting somewhere that windows either doesn't trip (hardware) or isn't incompatible with (setting)
2012-03-13T11:11:00.000Z	root________	samster34	tried a 32 bit version?
2012-03-13T11:12:00.000Z	root________	samster34	could be 64 bit is disabled.  Make sure it's enabled and try a 32 bit OS.
2012-03-13T11:25:00.000Z	samster34	root________	okay it seems stuck now. last line was "[TTM] Zone kernel: Avilable graphics memory: 431040 kiB."
2012-03-13T11:26:00.000Z	root________	samster34	32 or 64 bit this time, and what boot-time options?
2012-03-13T11:29:00.000Z	root________	samster34	I'm sorry, but I'm out of ideas here.  Best I can suggest is to keep trying and watch the boot output for something useful.  there might be something in the acpi and apic settings but I don't remember them off the top of my head.
2012-03-13T11:30:00.000Z	root________	samster34	and if you can't figure it out, try again when there are more people active.  they're generally pretty helpful.  Or the forums.
2012-03-13T11:31:00.000Z	root________	samster34	I had the same problem with an old win 95 compaq computer.  never did figure it out.  settled for partial data recovery and junked it.
