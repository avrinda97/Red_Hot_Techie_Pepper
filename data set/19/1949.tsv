2012-06-18T16:02:00.000Z	fidel		hi - i am wondering what apps you guys might recommend on ubuntu for time-tracking. I.e. i would like to track single tasks in my daily workflow in categories like: doing mail, doing research etc
2012-06-18T16:03:00.000Z	fidel		i stumpled upon hamster right now - which seems ...ok ... but its the only app i tested so far
2012-06-18T16:03:00.000Z	fidel		it would be great if the app would let me generate reports
2012-06-18T16:05:00.000Z	UndiFineD	fidel	zeitgeist does most of that
2012-06-18T16:06:00.000Z	UndiFineD		it does not tell you what to do, but you can look at what you have done before
2012-06-18T16:13:00.000Z	fidel	UndiFineD	yep it does - but then again it does it NOT in categories
2012-06-18T16:13:00.000Z	fidel		it does it on file-system layer iirc
2012-06-18T16:13:00.000Z	fidel		so - its not really usefull for time-tracking - but for file-usage history or am i wrong?
2012-06-18T16:18:00.000Z	UndiFineD	fidel	well perhaps you could schedule some tasks in evolution calender
2012-06-18T16:19:00.000Z	UndiFineD	fidel	or how about a crontab :P
2012-06-18T16:19:00.000Z	fidel	UndiFineD	not using evolution either ;)
2012-06-18T16:19:00.000Z	fidel	UndiFineD	using cron for time-tracking sounds ....well like using os2 nowadays
2012-06-18T16:20:00.000Z	fidel		os2 was fine - but you wouldnt consider it today in99,99% of all cases ;)
2012-06-18T16:20:00.000Z	UndiFineD		os2 is still being used today :P
2012-06-18T16:20:00.000Z	fidel	UndiFineD	yep - but not in most cases ...see 99,99% ;)
2012-06-18T16:21:00.000Z	UndiFineD		IBM loves it for their old tape robotics
2012-06-18T16:21:00.000Z	fidel	UndiFineD	anyway it was just an example - i am looking for time-tracking apps - not manual hacks offering some workaround for not having a real solution ;)
2012-06-18T16:26:00.000Z	UndiFineD	fidel	http://askubuntu.com/questions/4113/which-time-tracker-application-do-you-recommend
2012-06-18T16:26:00.000Z	fidel	UndiFineD	thanks ...lets see if theres something new.
