2012-04-27T07:00:00.000Z	psusi	gogeta	according to that link, there were two different sempron 3200+ part numbers, one supports 64 bit
2012-04-27T07:00:00.000Z	gogeta	psusi	well yea the 3200 x2
2012-04-27T07:02:00.000Z	gogeta	psusi	yea thats the 64 bit ones
2012-04-27T07:10:00.000Z	psusi	gogeta	huh?  "some" 64 bit support?  it's kind of either all or nothing
2012-04-27T07:11:00.000Z	gogeta	psusi	nope some atoms had 64 emu
2012-04-27T07:14:00.000Z	gogeta	psusi	some prossers like the atom n270 are not true 64
2012-04-27T07:15:00.000Z	psusi	gogeta	how is there a half way?  either it supports 64 bit instructions/addressing/registers, or not...
