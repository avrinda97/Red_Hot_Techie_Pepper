2007-06-17T13:23:00.000Z	tom_		Hey Everyone - I am trying to setup some shared in Samba but getting some authentification issues - ive tried the samba channel - but there just confusing me! Can someone spare 5 minutes to walk me through it?
2007-06-17T13:23:00.000Z	huzz	tom_	what exactly do you need
2007-06-17T13:24:00.000Z	tom_	huzz	Just want to setup 2 shares one for music and one for films for our home network - but with user authentification (so i can write changes to the share but others cant!)
2007-06-17T13:24:00.000Z	huzz	tom_	have you added users to samba?
2007-06-17T13:25:00.000Z	tom_	huzz	sure have - they just point me to a Wiki where i get highly confused, bang my fist on the table a few times and throw the computer out the window in frstration
2007-06-17T13:25:00.000Z	huzz	tom_	lol thats ok
2007-06-17T13:25:00.000Z	tom_	huzz	ive set the shares up and can access them fine - but cant write to them. Once i change the authentification mode - i get all sorts of problems :(
2007-06-17T13:25:00.000Z	huzz	tom_	you can easily assign shares via the gui as well
2007-06-17T13:26:00.000Z	tom_	huzz	Theres a GUI!? (ive been using webmin!!)
2007-06-17T13:27:00.000Z	huzz	tom_	actually the gui just allows normal sharing access to the folders
2007-06-17T13:27:00.000Z	tom_	huzz	N00b Question here - but will that still work for windows clients?? (with authentification)
2007-06-17T13:27:00.000Z	huzz	tom_	the webmin is more precise but if you want to just have users to just have normal read access
2007-06-17T13:27:00.000Z	huzz	tom_	yup they just have to type the username and password (you will need to create another user on your box, though)
2007-06-17T13:28:00.000Z	tom_	huzz	Awesome - is the gui pre-installed or a seperate install requirement?
2007-06-17T13:28:00.000Z	huzz	tom_	all i've done is typed, samba in the synaptic package installer and installed samba
2007-06-17T13:29:00.000Z	tom_	huzz	Ok - which i have done - wheres the client to configure it?
2007-06-17T13:30:00.000Z	huzz	tom_	basically what you need to do is create a user give him read only access and then add the user to samba, with the same username and your own password or no password and thats all. When the windows clients try to access the shares they will use the user account with the read only access simple and sweet
2007-06-17T13:30:00.000Z	huzz	tom_	theres no client as such, all you need to do is right click on a file allow it for sharing
2007-06-17T13:30:00.000Z	tom_	huzz	Ok thanks man - i will give that a shot :)
