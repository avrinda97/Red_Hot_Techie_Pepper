2010-07-27T01:39:00.000Z	c3l		okay, so you have a folder containing files you want to link to? and you dont want to move the folder (why?) but you want to access it from your ~/Documents?
2010-07-27T01:41:00.000Z	srk9	c3l	Send him to #gentoo to learn how to install Gentoo Linux. He will get over his fear of the terminal if he suceeds in installing it.
2010-07-27T01:42:00.000Z	c3l	srk9	haha, it might scare him away too ;)
2010-07-27T01:43:00.000Z	srk9	c3l	Well, the alternative is Mac OS X.
2010-07-27T01:43:00.000Z	c3l	srk9	why not just use ubuntu? I guess Im missing your point
2010-07-27T01:44:00.000Z	srk9	c3l	I think the idea was to make someone learn how to use the terminal.
2010-07-27T01:50:00.000Z	srk9	c3l	do you have any idea why he does not just do that if a symlink is what he wanted to make?
2010-07-27T01:51:00.000Z	c3l	srk9	newcomers from the dark side are often stubborn and wants to do it the way they did it before (then why change..)
2010-07-27T01:52:00.000Z	srk9	c3l	I thought windows did not support symbolic links.
2010-07-27T01:53:00.000Z	c3l	srk9	me too, I dont really know what he's refering to
2010-07-27T01:53:00.000Z	c3l	srk9	irssi, the besct client af them all (incl guis :)
2010-07-27T01:56:00.000Z	c3l	srk9	tbh ive never seen anyone use another terminalbased irc client than irssi. (when trying it, dont get scared of, it is quite annoying at the start if not used to similar programs. but its well documented on its site)
2010-07-27T01:57:00.000Z	srk9	c3l	thanks for the information. I have it installed now, so I will try it out in a bit.
2010-07-27T01:58:00.000Z	c3l	srk9	the #irssi is good too for help, anyways gl :)
2010-07-27T01:58:00.000Z	srk9	c3l	The reason is because binaries restrict what you can do with software.
2010-07-27T01:59:00.000Z	srk9	c3l	thanks. I will try that.
2010-07-27T01:59:00.000Z	c3l	srk9	I can still easily get the sourceif I want in ubuntu, but mostly I never have too
2010-07-27T02:01:00.000Z	srk9	c3l	Anyway, with binaries, you have quite a few things chosen for you. Large pieces of software typically have different build options. Those build options turn on and off different features. Sometimes they control the selection of multiple mutually exclusive features. You need to compile from source to get them. By having an OS that always compiles from source, you can get the best of both worlds, because it needs to be designed
2010-07-27T02:03:00.000Z	srk9	c3l	I am moving to $ubuntu-offtopic
