2007-01-28T17:09:00.000Z	Enverex		My machine seems to take far too long to boot --- Grub --> Login = 64 seconds, Login --> Idle = 30 seconds
2007-01-28T17:10:00.000Z	eternalswd	Enverex	what are your specs?
2007-01-28T17:11:00.000Z	Enverex	eternalswd	Athlon64 X2 3800+, 2GB PC3200 RAM, HD that clocks in at 76MB/s under HDParm
2007-01-28T17:14:00.000Z	Enverex	eternalswd	Thoughts?
2007-01-28T17:17:00.000Z	eternalswd	Enverex	I don't know what to tell you.  Is this a vanilla install?  Did it used to go faster?
2007-01-28T17:17:00.000Z	Enverex	eternalswd	Erm, no, relatively new install
2007-01-28T17:18:00.000Z	eternalswd	Enverex	are you using 64-bit kernel?
2007-01-28T17:18:00.000Z	Enverex	eternalswd	No
2007-01-28T17:18:00.000Z	eternalswd	Enverex	are you on dapper or edgy?
2007-01-28T17:19:00.000Z	Enverex	eternalswd	Edgy, updated to Feisty to see if that would help but no change in performance
2007-01-28T17:24:00.000Z	Enverex	eternalswd	Thoughts then?
2007-01-28T17:25:00.000Z	eternalswd	Enverex	you might want to contact jinacio on ubuntuforums.org looks like he has the same processor as you and knows ways of speeding up boot times
2007-01-28T17:26:00.000Z	eternalswd	Enverex	specifically using initNG instead of init
2007-01-28T17:27:00.000Z	Enverex	eternalswd	It's more the bit after boot that I'm more bothered about. 30 seconds from login to idle is excessive
2007-01-28T17:28:00.000Z	eternalswd	Enverex	do you have any startup scripts?
2007-01-28T17:29:00.000Z	Enverex	eternalswd	Not that I'm aware of
2007-01-28T17:33:00.000Z	eternalswd	Enverex	under System->Preferences->Sessions, Startup Programs tab, by default I had 4 scripts running, update-manager, gnome-power-manager, gnome-volume-manager --sm-disable, and /usr/lib/evolution/2.8/evolution-alarm-notify, you can probably disable the first and fourth
2007-01-28T17:33:00.000Z	Enverex	eternalswd	Yeah, I'd already turned those two off and nothing else special there, so still no idea :(
2007-01-28T17:34:00.000Z	eternalswd	Enverex	do you have compiz or beryl?
