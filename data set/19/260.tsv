2012-09-17T12:15:00.000Z	Josh		so How do you restart gui :[
2012-09-17T12:16:00.000Z	Josh		No
2012-09-17T12:16:00.000Z	Josh		On ubuntu\
2012-09-17T12:18:00.000Z	crizis	Josh	gnome-shell, to be exact. not gnome3
2012-10-10T10:04:00.000Z	crizis	Josh	it _is_ actual proper install of ubuntu
2012-10-10T10:04:00.000Z	crizis	Josh	it only runs inside an image in windows'es filesystem
2012-10-10T10:04:00.000Z	Josh	crizis	Yes, but people say, It is not a "proper" install
2012-10-10T10:05:00.000Z	crizis	Josh	install 'guest additions' in virtualbox to get better gfx performance
2012-10-10T10:05:00.000Z	Josh	crizis	Did
2012-10-10T10:06:00.000Z	Josh	crizis	what exactly guest addition does, Basically, how it has all the necessary drivers for every type of guest os?
2012-10-10T10:13:00.000Z	crizis	Josh	eventually it will break when you install updates
2012-10-10T10:35:00.000Z	Josh	crizis	Upgrade I assume
2012-10-10T10:36:00.000Z	crizis	Josh	for regular updates, just click top-right power icon and there's updates available / system is up to date- menu entry which opens update manager
2012-10-10T10:36:00.000Z	crizis	Josh	for upgrade, this same updater app will tell 'new distribution release available' when stable release comes
2012-10-10T10:36:00.000Z	Josh	crizis	I know how to update stuff with update manager
2012-10-10T10:36:00.000Z	crizis	Josh	well, it's the same app that will notify you about distribution upgrades
2012-10-10T10:36:00.000Z	Josh	crizis	then entire ~600MB is downloaded again?
2012-10-10T10:37:00.000Z	crizis	Josh	also from ubuntu software centre -> manage software sources, you can define whether the updater prompts you for LTS releases only or for all releases
2012-10-10T10:37:00.000Z	crizis	Josh	it'll update all the packages. so ye, it's usually 500-1500mb depending how much software you got intsalled
