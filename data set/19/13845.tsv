2006-06-06T05:35:00.000Z	ighost		does anyone know the advantage of using the new broadcom wireless drivers instead of ndiswraper?
2006-06-06T05:36:00.000Z	Managu	ighost	new Broadcom drivers?
2006-06-06T05:37:00.000Z	ighost	Managu	ya there is a new module called bcm4xx or something
2006-06-06T05:37:00.000Z	Managu	ighost	tried google?
2006-06-06T05:37:00.000Z	ighost	Managu	well i was looking for a 'review' of them but no result
2006-06-06T05:38:00.000Z	ighost	Managu	they seem pretty flacky to me compared with ndiswrapper, but there might be an advantage in avoiding windows drivers...
2006-06-06T05:39:00.000Z	Managu	ighost	without really knowing, my guess would be (a) free software ideals and (b) distributability.
2006-06-06T05:39:00.000Z	ighost	Managu	that's what i would guess but i'm more interesting in the practical solution and ndiswrapper seems to work fine
2006-06-06T05:40:00.000Z	Managu	ighost	the only other thing I can think of is that ndiswrapper has no way to support master mode.  Free drivers _might_ support master mode, depending on the driver.
2006-06-06T05:41:00.000Z	ighost	Managu	master mode, is that the same as ad-hoc mode?
2006-06-06T05:41:00.000Z	Managu	ighost	no.  in master mode, your computer plays the same role as a wireless router
2006-06-06T05:42:00.000Z	ighost	Managu	and amphi: o that's interesting,
2006-06-06T05:45:00.000Z	ighost	Managu	well that is a pretty nice feature but i'd rather be able to run g mode not just b and ndiswrapper only supports b
2006-06-06T05:46:00.000Z	Managu	ighost	ehh?  You mean the bcm4xx drivers only support b?
2006-06-06T05:46:00.000Z	ighost	Managu	yup
2006-06-06T05:46:00.000Z	ighost	Managu	i've read it in a few places and also the instructions require that you set your ap to allow mixed mode
2006-06-06T05:47:00.000Z	ighost	Managu	mixed mode is when the ap allows both 802.11b and g
2006-06-06T05:47:00.000Z	Managu	ighost	I'm really no familiar with the details; and it's not clear that the bcm4xx driver even supports master mode
2006-06-06T05:47:00.000Z	Managu	ighost	yup
