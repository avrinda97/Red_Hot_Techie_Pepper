2005-04-19T13:47:00.000Z	RastaMahata		aight, be right back
2005-04-19T13:49:00.000Z	mackid_iBook	RastaMahata	yeah
2005-04-19T13:51:00.000Z	mackid_iBook	RastaMahata	I would suggest you just try sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx
2005-04-19T13:51:00.000Z	RastaMahata	mackid_iBook	I already did that, thats my problem
2005-04-19T13:52:00.000Z	mackid_iBook	RastaMahata	I see.  well, maybe sudo dpkg-reconfigure nvidia-glx.. that's all i can think of
2005-04-19T13:52:00.000Z	mackid_iBook	RastaMahata	what kernel are you running?
2005-04-19T14:04:00.000Z	mackid_iBook	RastaMahata	really, your problem shouldn't be a problem.  I've been running hoary for a month and everything has worked fine
2005-04-19T14:05:00.000Z	mackid_iBook	RastaMahata	i would suggest you do a format-reinstall of hoary
2005-04-19T14:05:00.000Z	mackid_iBook	RastaMahata	from the hoary final install CD released today.
2005-04-19T14:05:00.000Z	RastaMahata	mackid_iBook	I will have to download it first :( my connection sucks
2005-04-19T14:05:00.000Z	mackid_iBook	RastaMahata	if you're not in a hurry, order the CD
2005-04-19T14:06:00.000Z	RastaMahata	mackid_iBook	i already did
2005-04-19T14:06:00.000Z	RastaMahata	mackid_iBook	the thing that bothers me is that this was supposed to be easy as pie...
2005-04-19T14:06:00.000Z	mackid_iBook	RastaMahata	i see.  well, I don't know what to tell you - I'd wait.
2005-04-19T14:07:00.000Z	mackid_iBook	RastaMahata	it SHOULD BE.  on my machine, and this is with the hoary preview like a month ago, i just installed it fresh and *everything* worked.. sound, and all i had to do to get nvidia to work was sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx
2005-04-19T14:07:00.000Z	mackid_iBook	RastaMahata	the only thing that didn't work for me right away were DVDs, and all i had to do to fix that was enable DMA on my DVD drive, so really.  it should work.  what hardware do you have?
2005-04-19T14:08:00.000Z	RastaMahata	mackid_iBook	nforce2 chipset (sound, net), geforce4 mx 440 64 mb..
2005-04-19T14:08:00.000Z	mackid_iBook	RastaMahata	AMD or Intel?  not that it matters..
2005-04-19T14:09:00.000Z	RastaMahata	mackid_iBook	amd
