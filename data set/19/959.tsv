2011-07-04T20:01:00.000Z	ILoatheVista		Ack, where do I uninstall packages?!
2011-07-04T20:01:00.000Z	KM0201	ILoatheVista	synaptic, ubuntu software center, apt-get... there's several places
2011-07-04T20:03:00.000Z	ILoatheVista	KM0201	okay...you might be able to help a noob find the most painless way...in order to install restricted-extras I have to get rid of the libav codecs and another package that escapes me at the moment...suggestions?
2011-07-04T20:04:00.000Z	KM0201	ILoatheVista	so?... you don't really need those codecs w/ restricted-extras installed (or you shouldn't anyway)
2011-07-04T20:05:00.000Z	KM0201	ILoatheVista	what version of ubuntu are you using?
2011-07-04T20:07:00.000Z	KM0201	ILoatheVista	well, thats not a very good answer, because you can still download 10.04.. but anyway.. open up a terminal and type "sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras"  it will remove the conflicts and install the new software (frankly, ubuntu software center should have done this also)
2011-07-04T20:12:00.000Z	KM0201	ILoatheVista	ok, that makes sense...
2011-07-04T20:12:00.000Z	KM0201	ILoatheVista	i should say, that makes more sense...
2011-07-04T20:14:00.000Z	ILoatheVista	KM0201	this is an XPS One [Red] that I got from Dell in 2008.  I had Vista [insert sarcastic air quotes here] ULTIMATE and nothing but headaches.  I had a friend tell me to just jump into Ubuntu...I'm still in the "getting used to things mode."
2011-07-04T20:15:00.000Z	KM0201	ILoatheVista	your friend is an idiot... please tell me you're dual booting
2011-07-04T20:15:00.000Z	KM0201	ILoatheVista	good... going cold turkey to a new OS, is a good way to reinstall Windows in less than 3 days.
2011-07-04T20:15:00.000Z	KM0201	ILoatheVista	just use it, and only use vista when ou absolutely can't get something to work.
2011-07-04T20:15:00.000Z	ILoatheVista	KM0201	I am.  I thought I would try it out to make sure everything worked, first.
2011-07-04T20:16:00.000Z	KM0201	ILoatheVista	did you install w/ Wubi?
2011-07-04T20:16:00.000Z	ILoatheVista	KM0201	Yep.
2011-07-04T20:17:00.000Z	ILoatheVista	KM0201	sigh as in "uh-oh" or sigh as in "relief"? LOL
2011-07-04T20:17:00.000Z	KM0201	ILoatheVista	as in "uh-oh".. wubi si a train wreck.
2011-07-04T20:19:00.000Z	ILoatheVista	KM0201	it really wouldn't be any different than what I experienced with Vista...there were days when I couldn't keep Windows Explorer stable long enough to COPY FILES...sometimes my system backups would take days and I was virus/spyware/malware free.
2011-07-04T20:20:00.000Z	KM0201	ILoatheVista	well.. my biggest problem w/ Wubi, is if something happens to Windows, there's a good chance it will brick both OS's, if something happens to Ubuntu, there's a good chance it will brick both OS's.. if you have a traditional dual boot system, you should usually be able to boot at least one of the OS's.
