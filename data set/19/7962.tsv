2007-05-25T09:06:00.000Z	KaKaRoTo	crimsun	result isn't helpful :  http://pastebin.ca/509561
2007-05-25T09:07:00.000Z	crimsun	KaKaRoTo	no, use bash.
2007-05-25T09:07:00.000Z	KaKaRoTo	crimsun	symptoms : module hda_intel gets loaded, alsamixer works, /dev/dsp works, everything *seems* to work, but I hear no sound. I tried with kernels 2.6.17, 2.6.20 and 2.6.22
2007-05-25T09:08:00.000Z	KaKaRoTo	crimsun	oh ok, I thought sh was symlinked to bash. here's the result : http://pastebin.ca/509563
2007-05-25T09:10:00.000Z	crimsun	KaKaRoTo	have you tried probe_mask=1 or probe_mask=3 ?
2007-05-25T09:10:00.000Z	KaKaRoTo	crimsun	no, what's that supposed to do ?
2007-05-25T09:11:00.000Z	crimsun	KaKaRoTo	initialise the codec.
2007-05-25T09:11:00.000Z	KaKaRoTo	crimsun	should I do it on modprobe snd-hda-intel probe_mask=3 ?
2007-05-25T09:11:00.000Z	crimsun	KaKaRoTo	yes, but unload snd-hda-intel first, of course
2007-05-25T09:12:00.000Z	KaKaRoTo	crimsun	great! it works with probe_mask=3
