2009-08-29T10:07:00.000Z	Dan48p		well, i'm kind of trying to figure out which version to use ubuntu or kubuntu
2009-08-29T10:08:00.000Z	Dan48p		i have 3 different ones installed now
2009-08-29T10:08:00.000Z	Dan48p		i have been using ubuntu on this computer for about 6 months now, but in school we use the kde
2009-08-29T10:09:00.000Z	Dan48p		what does that do?
2009-08-29T10:11:00.000Z	Dan48p		the main thing in ubuntu that i use a lot that i haven't figured out is the multi compiz with the multi-desktops with icons in the boxes
2009-08-29T10:11:00.000Z	Dan48p		it seems as though i have 4 boxes with nothing in them and have to guess or remember whats there

2009-08-29T10:13:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	Dan48p	The text is red for you because that message is highlighted for you.
2009-08-29T10:14:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	Dan48p	Also, use nickname to specify who you're talking to.. Try typing "leaf" then press TAB key
2009-08-29T10:14:00.000Z	Dan48p	leaf-sheep	like this?
2009-08-29T10:14:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	Dan48p	Yup.
2009-08-29T10:14:00.000Z	Dan48p	leaf-sheep	that shows up a different color to you
2009-08-29T10:15:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	Dan48p	Right.
2009-08-29T10:20:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	Dan48p	You only should worry about your home directory (~) and nothing else.  That's where all your personal files and configuration usually are stored on.
2009-08-29T10:24:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	Dan48p	Assuming Windows are already installed when it arrive in the mail, you could resize the partition to make room for Ubuntu and install away.
2009-08-29T10:34:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	Dan48p	Google "Ubuntu Pocket Guide"  It's in PDF form and is free.
