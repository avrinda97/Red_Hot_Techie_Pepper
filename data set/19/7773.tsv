2007-06-25T09:13:00.000Z	Zeelot		hey, I just installed ubuntu feisty the and I wanted to add a simple LAMP server to test my projects but none of it seems to be included, is there a simple way of doing this without installing the server version?
2007-06-25T09:14:00.000Z	mike3_	Zeelot	You don't have to install the server version for any server servicese. :) Should all be in Synaptic.
2007-06-25T09:15:00.000Z	Zeelot	mike3_	hmm I couldnt seem to find but I'll look again
2007-06-25T09:15:00.000Z	mike3_	Zeelot	Did you enable the third party respotoires ?

2007-06-25T09:22:00.000Z	mike3_	Zeelot	Are you trying to install apache?
2007-06-25T09:23:00.000Z	mike3_	Zeelot	from the cmd line if you put in apt-get install apache
2007-06-25T09:23:00.000Z	mike3_	Zeelot	what happens?
2007-06-25T09:24:00.000Z	mike3_	Zeelot	You are suppose to do it via Synaptic
2007-06-25T09:24:00.000Z	mike3_	Zeelot	That's the frontend to apt-get
2007-06-25T09:24:00.000Z	mike3_	Zeelot	Not add/Remove
