2009-07-19T06:58:00.000Z	sebsebseb	chs200123	someone else Googled for you, when I  told him about this.   stage 2 error 2  2 : Bad file or directory type  This error is returned if a file requested is not a regular file, but something like a symbolic link, directory, or FIFO.

2009-07-19T06:59:00.000Z	chs200123	sebsebseb	im not really sure what all that means, but thank you
2009-07-19T07:00:00.000Z	sebsebseb	chs200123	yeah me either, or him
2009-07-19T07:00:00.000Z	chs200123		lol
2009-07-19T07:00:00.000Z	sebsebseb	chs200123	maybe  the  /boot/grub  stuff has been installed in a werid place,   which also means your menu.lst is,   or simpally the  menu.lst entrys aren't detecing your partition properly
2009-07-19T07:01:00.000Z	chs200123		im wondering if this has something to do with my raid configuration
2009-07-19T07:01:00.000Z	sebsebseb	chs200123	http://www.ubuntuforums.org is also good by the way
2009-07-19T07:02:00.000Z	chs200123		thankyou
2009-07-19T07:02:00.000Z	sebsebseb	chs200123	well it's a Grub error so it's not exactly distro specific and so  ##linux could be useful the general Linux channal
2009-07-19T07:03:00.000Z	sebsebseb	chs200123	well  I expect it's something to do with how your RAID is set up
