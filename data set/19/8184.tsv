2009-07-08T00:34:00.000Z	ShortWave	tyler_d	bash editor?
2009-07-08T00:34:00.000Z	ShortWave	tyler_d	You mean text editor.
2009-07-08T00:34:00.000Z	ShortWave	tyler_d	Bash is a shell
2009-07-08T00:34:00.000Z	tyler_d		no, bash.... shell script editor...
2009-07-08T00:35:00.000Z	ShortWave	tyler_d	nano
2009-07-08T00:35:00.000Z	ShortWave		or pico
2009-07-08T00:35:00.000Z	ShortWave		or joe
2009-07-08T00:35:00.000Z	ShortWave		or jed
2009-07-08T00:35:00.000Z	tyler_d		is nano gui or is that straight from terminal?
2009-07-08T00:35:00.000Z	ShortWave		it's a terminal-based text editor
2009-07-08T00:35:00.000Z	tyler_d		is there a gui one recommended?
2009-07-08T00:35:00.000Z	ShortWave		if you're looking for someone to do general text editing you might look at Eddie
2009-07-08T00:36:00.000Z	tyler_d		gedit isn't bad, or kate, just wondering if there is others that may be recommended
2009-07-08T00:36:00.000Z	ShortWave		Eddie is kinda neat, does syntax highlighting, and most compelling, has a nice "shell" kinda window (the worksheet) where you can test your scripts in situ

2009-07-08T00:37:00.000Z	ShortWave	tyler_d	Might do what you need, it's very lean, but I've used it for a long old time.
2009-07-08T00:38:00.000Z	tyler_d	ShortWave	checking it out... ty
