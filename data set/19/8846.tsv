2007-06-25T05:29:00.000Z	cafuego	nexous	i am
2007-06-25T05:29:00.000Z	nexous	cafuego	could you pastebin your menu.lst for me/
2007-06-25T05:29:00.000Z	cafuego	nexous	No, the machine that dualboots isn't on.
2007-06-25T05:30:00.000Z	nexous	cafuego	ehh :/
2007-06-25T05:30:00.000Z	cafuego	nexous	Bbasically I created /boot/fedora under grub and put the fedora ekrnel and initrd there, then I added kernel lines for fedora to my menu.lst
2007-06-25T05:30:00.000Z	nexous	cafuego	alright.
2007-06-25T05:31:00.000Z	cafuego	nexous	So root (hdx,y) stays the same for grub, you just use kernel /boot/fedora/vmlinuz-whatever root=/dev/whatever rgbh
2007-06-25T05:31:00.000Z	nexous	cafuego	alright, well I'm trying something like that and going to reboot, hopefully it works.
2007-06-25T05:31:00.000Z	cafuego	nexous	As long as you leabr the Ubuntu lines you can always mount the fedora stuff and copy files off.
2007-06-25T05:32:00.000Z	nexous	cafuego	alright.
2007-06-29T06:06:00.000Z	cafuego	nexous	/etc/hostname
2007-06-29T06:07:00.000Z	nexous	cafuego	System -> Network hostname will do the same as GUI right?
2007-06-29T06:07:00.000Z	cafuego	nexous	Umm... maybe? :-)
2007-06-29T06:07:00.000Z	nexous	cafuego	okay :-p ill just edit /etc/hostname :P
2007-07-19T08:30:00.000Z	cafuego	nexous	In many cases you don't, the server kernel package lacks the firmware needed for most wifi cards.
2007-07-19T08:30:00.000Z	nexous	cafuego	no, I configured the drivers into ndiswrapper like I would in desktop version
2007-07-19T08:31:00.000Z	nexous	cafuego	and I dont feel like installing ubuntu-desktop just to run one gui configuration when i can do it through server.
2007-07-19T08:34:00.000Z	cafuego	nexous	Ah ok, then just via either iwconfig or wpasupplicant, i suppose.
