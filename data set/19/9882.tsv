2006-09-02T09:28:00.000Z	Gevaudan82		Hi, I don't mean to start a rant or anything but is there any reason why the synaptec repos only have an older version of apache available with a non-traditional folder structure? are there other repos out there that have the latest version with a more standard feel to it?
2006-09-02T09:28:00.000Z	Flannel	Gevaudan82	its the debian/ubuntu folder structure, and, versions are frozen (besides bugfixes) per release
2006-09-02T09:29:00.000Z	Gevaudan82	Flannel	cool, thanks...i was just really surprised when installing apache, ssl, php, perl and the like through synaptec and all the version informatino showed up when accessing localhost or whatever it may be...this alone seems like a giant security risk
2006-09-02T09:30:00.000Z	Flannel	Gevaudan82	Er, version info?  That's fairly standard for apache
2006-09-02T09:30:00.000Z	Gevaudan82	Flannel	for apache, yes...but for everything else, it seems unnecessary
2006-09-02T09:30:00.000Z	Flannel	Gevaudan82	all the security patches are applied, its up-to-date that way
2006-09-02T09:30:00.000Z	Flannel	Gevaudan82	no, normal apache gives versions for everything else as well
2006-09-02T09:31:00.000Z	Gevaudan82	Flannel	interesting, i'll have to look how to turn that off...I'm normally a redhat/centos guy but i'm slowly migrating to ubuntu as a home/personal server platform
2006-09-02T09:32:00.000Z	Flannel	Gevaudan82	you'll probably find the ubuntu method of files/mods/etc a bit more friendly/intuitive, but as far as I know generic apache does provide that info
2006-09-02T09:33:00.000Z	Gevaudan82	Flannel	i've read the faq, but aside from a text mode installer and a XAMPP option which I don't want, is there any real difference between the server iso and the regular iso which I already have? lightning struck my server a couple weeks ago and my new box comes in on monday
2006-09-02T09:34:00.000Z	Flannel	Gevaudan82	it's not XAMMP, its LAMP.  The server ISO does have some server-tuned kernels.  Server and Alternate use the same text-mode installer
2006-09-02T09:34:00.000Z	Flannel	Gevaudan82	but, you can use the desktop ISO to install the entire thing, you'll just have a GUI ontop as well.  (alternate 'server' option is simply ubuntu-standard, instead of ubuntu-desktop)
2006-09-02T09:34:00.000Z	Gevaudan82	Flannel	interesting, i'll download the iso and try it out
2006-09-02T09:35:00.000Z	Gevaudan82	Flannel	good information, thanks
2006-09-02T10:00:00.000Z	Gevaudan82	Flannel	gotcha, first time connecting to ubuntu's irc servers
2006-09-20T11:20:00.000Z	Flannel	Gevaudan82	no, he won't.  He's already done that.
2006-09-20T12:16:00.000Z	Gevaudan82	Flannel	well it is 2:15 am at least on the east coast...i suppose the rules can bend about this hour ;)
2006-11-01T08:44:00.000Z	Gevaudan82	Flannel	there's the gui mysqladmin and a console mysqladmin...the former is basically to edit users, set permissions, and import/export dumps...the console can basically do everything that the gui can do
2006-11-28T08:08:00.000Z	Flannel	Gevaudan82	no, it's not installed by default.
