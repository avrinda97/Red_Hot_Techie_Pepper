2010-03-24T18:59:00.000Z	Urda	erUSUL	sorry, should have said I was already cd'd into the dir I want to use
2010-03-24T19:00:00.000Z	erUSUL	Urda	then use . --> find . -mtime +30 -delete (i would run it with -ptint instead of -delete first to make sure )
2010-04-01T18:41:00.000Z	erUSUL	Urda	if the file is yours sure
2010-04-01T18:41:00.000Z	Urda	erUSUL	hmmm doesn't seem to be working :-\ trying to change a file from my ownership to www-data:
2010-04-01T18:42:00.000Z	erUSUL	Urda	what error you get?
2010-04-01T18:42:00.000Z	erUSUL	Urda	what directorie is the file in?
2010-04-01T18:42:00.000Z	Urda	erUSUL	oh you know www-data might own the dir hang on
2010-04-01T18:43:00.000Z	Urda	erUSUL	it is in a directory in /var/www/ and I own the sub directory the chown is going on in
2010-04-01T18:45:00.000Z	Urda	erUSUL	basically I am copying a settings file into a backup dir, and want to chown, chmod the file afterwards
2010-04-01T18:46:00.000Z	erUSUL	Urda	if the parent dir is not yours maybe you have no permissions to chmod it
2010-04-01T18:47:00.000Z	Urda	erUSUL	ok I see
2010-04-01T18:48:00.000Z	erUSUL	Urda	ok
