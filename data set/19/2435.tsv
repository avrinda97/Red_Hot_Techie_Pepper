2010-09-03T22:15:00.000Z	lgp171188		Hi all, I have a query. I had a FAT32 partition that was shared between my Windows and Ubuntu installation. It was showing up in Ubuntu as 12 GB filesystem. But suddenly it now shows its name as æ±». Any clues on whysuch a thing has happened and how to correct it?
2010-09-03T22:17:00.000Z	sebsebseb	lgp171188	not sure, but you probably don't really need a FAT32 anymore, because Ubuntu can deal with NTFS read and write stabley since 7.10, and yeah other distros can do NTFS like this as well of course
2010-09-03T22:17:00.000Z	sebsebseb	lgp171188	and NTFS is also quite a bit better than FAT32
2010-09-03T22:17:00.000Z	lgp171188	sebsebseb	Yeah I agree, but how did such a name corruption happen? I am considering converting to NTFS
2010-09-03T22:18:00.000Z	sebsebseb	lgp171188	ideally  Linux file systems, but those aren't so easy to use with Windows as well
2010-09-03T22:21:00.000Z	lgp171188	sebsebseb	I know. The support for accessing extX filesystems in Windows is very poor. I will convert to NTFS but how to find out what could have caused it?
2010-09-03T22:21:00.000Z	sebsebseb	lgp171188	actsauly Ext3
2010-09-03T22:21:00.000Z	sebsebseb	lgp171188	theres a driver for Windows, that in my experience has worked reasaonbly well
2010-09-03T22:22:00.000Z	lgp171188	sebsebseb	ubottu: I have a ext4 filesystem. I haven't tried accessing that from Windows, though I had used some software to access ext3 from it when it was the default in Ubuntu
2010-09-03T22:22:00.000Z	sebsebseb	lgp171188	also maybe Pici or someone like that should change the !ext3 factoid a bit, since it used to be the default file system.
2010-09-03T22:22:00.000Z	sebsebseb	lgp171188	don't try and access Ext4 from Windows, probably won't really work out to well
2010-09-03T22:23:00.000Z	sebsebseb	lgp171188	however I am thinking you  could replace your Fat32 with a Ext3, and then probably use that driver, to access it from WIndows as well
2010-09-03T22:23:00.000Z	sebsebseb	lgp171188	however you don't need to do that really, since NTFS will probably be good enough
2010-09-03T22:24:00.000Z	lgp171188	sebsebseb	By using a non-native fs in Windows, I will lose a lot of benefits, so NTFS is the best bet for me. But how do such name corruptions like the name changing to æ±»happen?
2010-09-03T22:24:00.000Z	sebsebseb	lgp171188	Why do you want to use data in Windows anyway?
2010-09-03T22:25:00.000Z	sebsebseb	lgp171188	as for the name, I have no idea
2010-09-03T22:25:00.000Z	lgp171188	sebsebseb	Also NTFS support is *good* in Ubuntu
2010-09-03T22:25:00.000Z	sebsebseb	lgp171188	NTFS support is good in Linux distros, not only Ubuntu :)
2010-09-03T22:25:00.000Z	lgp171188	sebsebseb	No it was a FAT partition from some old installation of Windows
