2007-10-04T15:57:00.000Z	Pelo	F3000	 the ppl in #xubuntu can probably help

2007-10-04T15:57:00.000Z	F3000	Pelo	it's quite quiet in there.
2007-10-04T15:58:00.000Z	Pelo	F3000	ask your question we'll see what we can do
2007-10-04T16:02:00.000Z	Pelo	F3000	  start xfce4  , two words
2007-10-04T16:03:00.000Z	Pelo	F3000	 tell the ppl in #xubuntu , it's their guide
2007-10-04T16:03:00.000Z	Pelo	F3000	 try  sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg  see if there is something wrong with it ,  should restart x properly
2007-10-05T16:05:00.000Z	Pelo	F3000	assuming that xubuntu uses X as a windows manager , then you need to install it ,   sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg
2007-10-05T16:07:00.000Z	Pelo	F3000	 it should have been
2007-10-05T16:07:00.000Z	Pelo	F3000	 try this instead    sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop
2007-10-05T16:09:00.000Z	Pelo	F3000	ifyourinstall got borked you migth hve to instal xubuntu-desktop as well
2007-10-05T16:15:00.000Z	Pelo	F3000	took me 30 min to install the first time I tried ubuntu and it worked perfectly right from the start ,  you'rs is a special case
2007-10-05T16:16:00.000Z	Pelo	F3000	 do you bother to check the system requirements of the distro before you try to intall it ?
2007-10-05T16:16:00.000Z	F3000	Pelo	true is, that the CPU range of those 3 or 4 PCs have been 120MHz - 366MHz.
2007-10-05T16:17:00.000Z	Pelo	F3000	 maybe you should try an older version of slackware
2007-10-05T16:17:00.000Z	Pelo	F3000	 and I wouldn'T expect ay of the latest  snazzy  desktop to work
2007-10-05T16:17:00.000Z	F3000	Pelo	which is why I'm trying Xubuntu.
2007-10-05T16:18:00.000Z	Pelo	F3000	  xubuntu needs 128 megs of mem to work properly and i can tell you it is klunky on my aunts  700mhz pc
