2010-08-29T01:44:00.000Z	johzephine		haha
2010-08-29T01:44:00.000Z	johzephine		yeah
2010-08-29T01:45:00.000Z	maco	johzephine	*if* the source has a configure script, then "./configure && make && sudo make install"  but it could use something other than autotools, so if there isnt one, say so
2010-08-29T01:53:00.000Z	johzephine		okay I don't know what "do" ./configure && make install means
2010-08-29T01:55:00.000Z	maco	johzephine	in a terminal, go to the directory where you unpacked the source, and run "./configure && make && sudo make install"
2010-08-29T01:55:00.000Z	maco	johzephine	Paragon missed the "make" step in there
2010-08-29T01:56:00.000Z	maco	johzephine	leave off the quotes when you copy and paste it
2010-08-29T01:57:00.000Z	johzephine		to go to a directory i would just type it in and hit enter right?  then it says bash: the directory?
2010-08-29T01:58:00.000Z	johzephine		If I were new to windows I'd be lost too. :P
2010-08-29T01:59:00.000Z	johzephine	jrib	what do I do to go to a directory then?
2010-08-29T02:00:00.000Z	johzephine		cd?

2010-08-29T02:02:00.000Z	johzephine	jrib	okay.  What do I do to run it then?
2010-08-29T02:03:00.000Z	johzephine	jrib	yes
2010-08-29T02:03:00.000Z	maco	johzephine	is there a "configure" file or not?
