2010-10-01T21:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	l0de	 clamav is in the repos.
2010-10-01T21:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	l0de	 one of the many reasons to use 'noscript' and 'adblock'
2010-10-01T21:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	l0de	 theres clamav for linux, and a few others.. but if its a silly browser popup/scam.. an av program wont see that.
2010-10-01T21:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	l0de	 oh? ive never had the issue on linux.. and all the time on windows.
2010-10-01T21:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	l0de	 a browser scam ad. is not a virus.. and not really a OS  security 'issue' so have fun.
2010-10-01T21:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	l0de	 theres 3 differnt av softeares for linux,  try them out if you want.
2010-10-01T21:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	l0de	 as we mentioned.. a browser popup/scam - is not a virus.
2010-10-01T21:46:00.000Z	l0de	Dr_Willis	it is when it launches with your computer
2010-10-01T21:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	l0de	 best help.. reformat, reinstall, dont run as root next time. Have a nice day.
