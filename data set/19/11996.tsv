2005-12-13T08:16:00.000Z	YukiIkyuta	Absenth	its*!
2005-12-13T08:17:00.000Z	Absenth	YukiIkyuta	 with a little help from the new version of Crossover Office anyway :)
2005-12-13T08:17:00.000Z	YukiIkyuta	Absenth	blah! OpenOffice works just as well.
2005-12-13T08:20:00.000Z	Absenth	YukiIkyuta	 sure, as long as you're not going to school at ITT-Tech where their online courses are EXTREMELY picky about having IE, and MS Office.
2005-12-13T08:20:00.000Z	Absenth	YukiIkyuta	 problem 2 is I manage a windows network as my job, so some of the tools I just have to have.
2005-12-13T08:20:00.000Z	YukiIkyuta	Absenth	I suppose so!
2005-12-13T08:29:00.000Z	YukiIkyuta	Absenth	export CC=gcc-3.4
2005-12-13T08:48:00.000Z	YukiIkyuta	Absenth	`tar jxvf'
2005-12-13T08:48:00.000Z	YukiIkyuta	Absenth	and `tar zxvf' for .tar.gz's.
2005-12-13T08:49:00.000Z	Absenth	YukiIkyuta	 good to know,  I didn't know the j switch.  well versed in xvfz  :)
2005-12-13T08:49:00.000Z	YukiIkyuta	Absenth	^^
2005-12-13T09:00:00.000Z	YukiIkyuta	Absenth	the kernel headers installed don't match the one running!
2005-12-13T09:02:00.000Z	Absenth	YukiIkyuta	frogzoo, yeah I gathered that,  Synaptic doesn't have a headers 2.6.12-9 option....   And this is for installing vmware, it needs to create a kernel module.
2005-12-13T09:02:00.000Z	YukiIkyuta	Absenth	there's no kernel-headers-2.6.12-9 ?
2005-12-13T09:03:00.000Z	Absenth	YukiIkyuta	my bad, I'm a moron....
2005-12-13T09:03:00.000Z	YukiIkyuta	Absenth	glad you found it!
2005-12-13T09:12:00.000Z	Absenth	YukiIkyuta	Seveas, frogzoo, soundray, Thank you all for your assistance in getting vmware up and running on my system.
2005-12-13T09:47:00.000Z	YukiIkyuta	Absenth	unzip! Install it if you've not got it.
