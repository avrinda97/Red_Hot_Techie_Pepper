2009-04-09T05:19:00.000Z	insomnia		We got the Linksys WUSB54GC USB thing because ubuntu.com said it worked "out of the box"
2009-04-09T05:19:00.000Z	insomnia		but, um.  Their concept of "out of the box" is apparently different from mine.
2009-04-09T05:19:00.000Z	insomnia		I went and got a driver rt73 and compiled it, inserted the module, try to bring up the interface, doesn't work.
2009-04-09T05:19:00.000Z	insomnia		says no such interface
2009-04-09T05:20:00.000Z	insomnia		so at this point, I'm thinking Red Hat might be a better option.
2009-04-09T05:20:00.000Z	insomnia		and this join/part/quit stuff is making me insane.  The default IRC client pidgin is apparently not even configurable
2009-04-09T05:21:00.000Z	insomnia		I'm reading it right now.
2009-04-09T05:21:00.000Z	insomnia		I followed it step-by-step
2009-04-09T05:21:00.000Z	jrib	insomnia	and?
2009-04-09T05:21:00.000Z	jrib	insomnia	check your plugins.  Also, have you read the wireless documentation on the wiki?
2009-04-09T05:21:00.000Z	insomnia	jrib	of course I have.
2009-04-09T05:22:00.000Z	jrib	insomnia	more context...

2009-04-09T05:22:00.000Z	jrib	insomnia	can you link me to the docs you are following?
2009-04-09T05:23:00.000Z	jrib	insomnia	I don't see a link to the wiki there
2009-04-09T05:26:00.000Z	jrib	insomnia	well you're confusing me now, because we started this conversation with "have you read the docs on the wiki"
2009-04-09T05:26:00.000Z	insomnia	jrib	I start at the beginning.  At the wiki.  I got linked off to this thread from the wiki
2009-04-09T05:27:00.000Z	jrib	insomnia	hope you sort it out
2009-04-09T05:28:00.000Z	insomnia	jrib	well thanks for the help?
