2004-12-21T10:01:00.000Z	wood1		Well I have to my knowledge removed all the programs that I don't need
2004-12-21T10:02:00.000Z	wood1		What I need is some information about system programs which can be removed safely linke LVM, etc ?
2004-12-21T10:03:00.000Z	socomm	wood1	Bash.
2004-12-21T10:03:00.000Z	socomm	wood1	Just kidding.
2004-12-21T10:05:00.000Z	socomm	wood1	Well you can get rid of postfix, assuming you don't run a mail server.
2004-12-21T10:06:00.000Z	socomm	wood1	You can also remove cups, assuming you don't have any printing needs.
2004-12-21T10:08:00.000Z	socomm	wood1	Dunno about that.
2004-12-21T10:11:00.000Z	socomm	wood1	Not that I'm aware of.
2004-12-21T10:12:00.000Z	socomm	wood1	What I'd usualy do to cut down on HDD space is get rid of my DE since that usually is a big chunk of disk.
2004-12-21T10:13:00.000Z	socomm	wood1	If you're tight on space I'd go with fluxbox since it's one of the smallest WM's I've seen so far.
2004-12-21T10:21:00.000Z	socomm	wood1	vi is not installed.
2004-12-21T10:22:00.000Z	socomm	wood1	vim is the only vi like editor installed, as far as I know.
2004-12-21T10:22:00.000Z	socomm	wood1	If you wanna keep any settings just  back em up before you delete anything.
2004-12-21T10:24:00.000Z	socomm	wood1	Maybe dev tools if you have no use for them.
2004-12-21T10:25:00.000Z	wood1	socomm	which dev tools
2004-12-21T10:25:00.000Z	socomm	wood1	Dunno, I don't know any installed by default. Check if you have gcc installed.
2004-12-21T10:26:00.000Z	socomm	wood1	Like I said if you have no use for them ...
2004-12-21T10:27:00.000Z	socomm	wood1	Check if you have any foreign tongue dictionaries.
