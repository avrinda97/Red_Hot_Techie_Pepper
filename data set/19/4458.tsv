2009-01-09T15:19:00.000Z	SmokeyD1		hey people. On a standard ubuntu install, are users able to boot grub into single user mode and change the root password without knowing it first?
2009-01-09T15:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	SmokeyD1	log a bug
2009-01-09T15:21:00.000Z	SmokeyD1	ActionParsnip	why?
2009-01-21T18:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	SmokeyD1	i found the clamav on the repos refused to update definitoins and had to compile the source for the latest from the clamav site
2009-01-21T18:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	SmokeyD1	try: sudo freshclam
2009-01-21T18:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	SmokeyD1	if it doesnt update you may have to compile it
2009-01-21T18:10:00.000Z	SmokeyD1	ActionParsnip	freshclam only updates the virus definitions, not the program itself
2009-01-21T18:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	SmokeyD1	apt-get upgrade upgrades the app
2009-01-21T18:11:00.000Z	SmokeyD1	ActionParsnip	0.94 isn't available for hardy
2009-01-21T18:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	SmokeyD1	but you are relying on the repo maintainers to update them
2009-01-21T18:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	SmokeyD1	then compile it
2009-01-21T18:13:00.000Z	SmokeyD1	ActionParsnip	so there is no other ubuntu repository that provides 0.94.1?
2009-03-10T12:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	SmokeyD1	wise to ask, buy whats compatible and you save a TONNE of grief
2009-03-10T12:47:00.000Z	SmokeyD1	ActionParsnip	ok, yeah that is a complete list of supported hardware, but is there no recommendation for a specific chipset?
2010-05-11T01:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	SmokeyD1	cups has one
2010-05-11T01:04:00.000Z	SmokeyD1	ActionParsnip	cups as in the print server? It has an app to draw that type of pictures?
2010-05-11T01:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	SmokeyD1	http://www.debianadmin.com/images/cups/1.png
2010-05-11T01:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	SmokeyD1	i am not clear what you are after
2010-05-11T01:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	SmokeyD1	many apps have web UIs, Transmission and many other torrent clients have them
