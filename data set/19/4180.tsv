2009-03-09T07:54:00.000Z	billybigrigger		when is it going to be a good idea to purchase ATI gfx cards? are they going to release decent or fix their current drivers any time soon?
2009-03-09T07:55:00.000Z	ZyktoicK9	billybigrigger	even Cannonical has asked ATI for better driver - I wouldn't hold my breath...
2009-03-09T07:56:00.000Z	ZyktoicK9	billybigrigger	7025 can't be too bad.  what are you trying to run that slow?  compiz or games?
2009-03-09T07:57:00.000Z	billybigrigger	ZyktoicK9	i want a new 22" widescreen lcd and this doesnt have onboard dvi
2009-03-09T07:57:00.000Z	ZyktoicK9	billybigrigger	ahhh that explains it - kinda surprised gaming is so poor...
2009-03-09T07:57:00.000Z	billybigrigger	ZyktoicK9	im buying another monitor, and i need dual dvi
2009-03-09T07:58:00.000Z	billybigrigger	ZyktoicK9	well, railroad tycoon 3 runs...red alert 3, supreme comander dont, they new tom clancy hawx demo doesnt...i have amd x2 5000 oc'd to 2.9ghz with 2gb ram so i shouid be ok there...onboard gfx = no good for gaming, no matter what onboard chip you have
2009-03-09T08:00:00.000Z	ZyktoicK9	billybigrigger	ya i got a 8800 GT which drives dual monitors - it's pretty sweet.  i can pretty run most games flat out.  gaming and multimonitor is a pain though :(  <NOT A GAME I PLAY>Savage 2 has a native 64bit linux version and even played perfectly with the dual monitors</NOT A GAME I PLAY>
2009-03-09T08:01:00.000Z	billybigrigger	ZyktoicK9	some guy on craigslist here in calgary has an 8800 gts for sale, $140 canadian i think
2009-03-09T08:02:00.000Z	billybigrigger	ZyktoicK9	i think im gonna go with a 9600 or 9800 depends how much i feel like spending that day, im cheap and havent weighed out the options of going with a 9800
2009-03-09T08:02:00.000Z	ZyktoicK9	billybigrigger	bet you could be an ATI for a lot less -- joking of course
2009-03-09T08:03:00.000Z	billybigrigger	ZyktoicK9	i havent owned an ati card for years...last one came in my old laptop x600 i think
2009-03-09T08:05:00.000Z	billybigrigger	ZyktoicK9	so if you dont play savage2 on your 8800 what do you play? and native or in wine?
2009-03-09T08:07:00.000Z	ZyktoicK9	billybigrigger	i'm pretty much exclusivly a FPS guy: Quake 4, Doom 3, UT2004, i did have a cool MedalofHonour(i think) game running under wine that required DX10, that was fun to get running.
2009-03-09T08:08:00.000Z	billybigrigger	ZyktoicK9	so you run all games in wine? good i was thinking my gaming performace was due to wine, was thinking of going with cedega or transgaming or whatever but ill stick with wine
2009-03-09T08:08:00.000Z	ZyktoicK9	billybigrigger	no wine at all
2009-03-09T08:08:00.000Z	billybigrigger	ZyktoicK9	native only?
2009-03-09T08:09:00.000Z	ZyktoicK9	billybigrigger	all the games i mentioned have native linux - run servers too
2009-03-09T08:09:00.000Z	billybigrigger	ZyktoicK9	ahh
