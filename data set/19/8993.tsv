2007-12-02T02:15:00.000Z	eNons3nse		can someone please help me.  i'm getting an input/output error when i try to copy files from my external mp3 player.
2007-12-02T02:15:00.000Z	juano__	eNons3nse	what sort of error ?
2007-12-02T02:15:00.000Z	eNons3nse	juano__	here is an example of what it says.  cp: reading `Dubwise & Otherwise 2/Gregory Isaacs - Slave Master.mp3': Input/output error
2007-12-02T02:16:00.000Z	juano__	eNons3nse	is the device properly mounted ?
2007-12-02T02:16:00.000Z	juano__	eNons3nse	when you plugged in the mp3 player, it should appear on the desktop
2007-12-02T02:16:00.000Z	eNons3nse	juano__	should be.  it auto mounts when i plug it in.  i can browse the file system & see everything that's there.  nothing looks out of the ordinary.
2007-12-02T02:17:00.000Z	juano__	eNons3nse	i see... , do a cat /etc/mtab and see if it appears there
2007-12-02T02:19:00.000Z	juano__	eNons3nse	what filesystem ?
2007-12-02T02:21:00.000Z	eNons3nse	juano__	i don't know what file system is on there.  it runs on linux though.
2007-12-02T02:22:00.000Z	juano__	eNons3nse	sudo fdisk -l  should output all disks connected to the motherboard, there your device's filesystem should appear
2007-12-02T02:22:00.000Z	juano__	eNons3nse	and there partitions of course
2007-12-02T02:24:00.000Z	eNons3nse	juano__	it's FAT32
2007-12-02T02:24:00.000Z	juano__	eNons3nse	filesystem should be mounted as vfat then
2007-12-02T02:25:00.000Z	eNons3nse	juano__	it's /dev/sdb1
2007-12-02T02:25:00.000Z	juano__	eNons3nse	yep, does it show up while connected in /etc/mtab ?
2007-12-02T02:26:00.000Z	juano__	eNons3nse	does this happen only in ubuntu, have you tried connecting it to windows box or other OS ?
2007-12-02T02:26:00.000Z	eNons3nse	juano__	yea.  it says vfat in there.  /dev/sdb1 /media/AV404 vfat rw,nosuid,nodev,shortname=mixed,uid=1000,utf8,umask=077,usefree 0 0
2007-12-02T02:27:00.000Z	juano__	eNons3nse	mmm seems fine with the rw option, that should let you write fine , is this USB ? try another USB if it is
2007-12-02T02:27:00.000Z	juano__	eNons3nse	also do what gordonjcp suggests
