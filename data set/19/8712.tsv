2008-09-17T06:54:00.000Z	hellcattrav		is there something comparable in linux(prob with compiz) to Mac's dashboard? to have the widgets not on hte litteral desktop?
2008-09-17T06:55:00.000Z	airtonix	hellcattrav	no, not completly
2008-09-17T06:55:00.000Z	hellcattrav	airtonix	what is there then?
2008-09-17T06:55:00.000Z	airtonix	hellcattrav	avant-window-navigator comes pretty close
2008-09-17T06:56:00.000Z	airtonix	hellcattrav	but its not a direct clone of dashboard unfortunatly

2008-09-17T06:57:00.000Z	airtonix	hellcattrav	or sudo apt-get install avant-window-navigator
2008-09-17T06:58:00.000Z	airtonix	hellcattrav	awn wesbite here : http://wiki.awn-project.org/index.php?title=Main_Page
2008-09-17T08:13:00.000Z	airtonix	hellcattrav	yes
2008-09-17T08:14:00.000Z	airtonix	hellcattrav	avant-window-navigator is as close as it gets to dashboard
2008-09-17T08:15:00.000Z	airtonix	hellcattrav	you could just remove the bottom panel
2008-09-17T08:16:00.000Z	airtonix	hellcattrav	no....awn is a launcher with applets too...but you will find gnome-panel has the most functionality and applets available to it

2008-09-17T08:18:00.000Z	airtonix	hellcattrav	you can drag icons from the desktop onto avants panel
2008-09-17T08:19:00.000Z	airtonix	hellcattrav	for example if i dragged the launcher icon for pidgn to the avant panel, then when i launch pidgn from there....i can then click on that icon to minimisi it to the panel...plugins availble will also change pidgns icon to your current status icon
2008-09-17T08:21:00.000Z	airtonix	hellcattrav	its pretty much like dashboard cept not so open ended and powerful
2008-09-17T08:23:00.000Z	airtonix	hellcattrav	if you say the panel is the thing up top with the apple symbol then yes the two are different....when i said panel i was refering to the panel avant craetes....i call it panel because it doesnt extend right across the desktop..it merely sizes itself based on the contents
2008-09-17T08:25:00.000Z	airtonix	hellcattrav	install it and look for yourself...
