2008-07-24T03:49:00.000Z	binskipy2u		hey guys, any REAL advantage of 64bit over 32bit besides seeing all your ram if you have over 3.5 gigs?
2008-07-24T03:49:00.000Z	binskipy2u		performance wise?
2008-07-24T03:50:00.000Z	binskipy2u		will 32bit see 3 cores? i have a triple core computer
2008-07-24T03:52:00.000Z	binskipy2u		im just having issues w/multimedia on sites etc w/64bit
2008-07-24T03:52:00.000Z	binskipy2u		not enough codecs
2008-07-24T03:52:00.000Z	binskipy2u		so besides losing 500mb of ram.. will there be any negative effects using 32 bit on a triple core amd 8450 computer?
2008-07-24T03:54:00.000Z	binskipy2u		ok , will 32bit see all 3 cores just like 64bit ubuntu? i know it will "miss" 500mb of ram.. thats' ok as long as i dont have to worry bout "force" installing some of my favorite things
2008-07-24T03:54:00.000Z	binskipy2u		wont it use the same restricted video drivers whether its 32 or 64bit
2008-07-24T03:55:00.000Z	nickrud	binskipy2u	it should, if you boot the live cd and do cat /proc/cpuinfo , you should see all three processors
2008-07-24T03:57:00.000Z	nickrud	binskipy2u	if you use the -server version of the kernel, it should also see the lost memory
2008-07-24T03:57:00.000Z	binskipy2u	nickrud	even on 32bit?
2008-07-24T03:57:00.000Z	nickrud	binskipy2u	if you have pae hardware that is
2008-07-24T03:58:00.000Z	nickrud	binskipy2u	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_Address_Extension
2008-08-04T09:12:00.000Z	nickrud	binskipy2u	working java plugin in the browser? (workaroundable)
2008-08-04T09:20:00.000Z	nickrud	binskipy2u	probably 30 or 40 (at most) actually watching.
2008-08-04T09:21:00.000Z	nickrud	binskipy2u	I think you might get some better insight on the server kernel on #ubuntu-server. Maybe
2008-08-04T09:22:00.000Z	nickrud	binskipy2u	no one is sure about an answer for you. I know a few things about the server kernel, but have never timed the differences.
2008-08-04T09:29:00.000Z	nickrud	binskipy2u	no one has the answer, so chill for a bit. Ask the complete question every 15 minutes or so, if someone knows the answer they will answer
2008-08-04T09:34:00.000Z	nickrud	binskipy2u	#ubuntu-server , or maybe #ubuntu-offtopic. the latter often has dev's floating around, and if they're not playing too much they answer that kind of question
