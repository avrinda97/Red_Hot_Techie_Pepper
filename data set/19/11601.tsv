2006-01-17T08:32:00.000Z	lowman62	Katie^	may i pm you?
2006-01-22T09:35:00.000Z	lowman62	Katie^	then yes I would create a fat32 partition for both to access
2006-01-22T09:36:00.000Z	lowman62	Katie^	personally I use partitionmagic for windows...errmm! you have that?
2006-01-22T09:37:00.000Z	lowman62	Katie^	well the reason I say that is that it would be easier to do from the windows side of your system then just mount it from the ubuntu side
2006-01-22T09:38:00.000Z	lowman62	Katie^	then you should be able to access your mp3's or whatever from bothsides
2006-01-22T09:40:00.000Z	lowman62	Katie^	If you are going to use partitionmagic just use the resize widows partiton wizard and resize the windows partition and format it as fat32...you will see it is easy in partitionmagic
