2005-12-14T14:48:00.000Z	jdier	franfar	go to your sessions menu and add there
2005-12-14T14:48:00.000Z	jdier	franfar	- system, preferences, sessions
2005-12-14T14:50:00.000Z	franfar	jdier	- I'm sorry, but I don't know how to do that, I'm using X-Chat
2005-12-14T14:52:00.000Z	franfar	jdier	- Yes, version 5.10, but I never used this program before...
2005-12-14T14:53:00.000Z	jdier	franfar	- I was answering your question about how to start gdesklets automatically when a session starts.
2005-12-14T14:54:00.000Z	franfar	jdier	- Oh thanks, could you tell me how to do that? Is bcause is very annoing to start manually every time
2005-12-14T14:54:00.000Z	jdier	franfar	- from the gnome or ubuntu menu choose system, then choose preferences, then choose session
2005-12-14T14:56:00.000Z	franfar	jdier	- Oh I see! but... the thing is that since Gdesklets is on the Programs menu, I can't find on that dialogue (startup programs)
2005-12-14T14:58:00.000Z	jdier	franfar	 you are not looking for start up menu.  You are looking for the systems menu.  At the bottom or top of your screen there is a panel or menu bar that has the ubuntu logo, then <applications> <places> <system>....  yes?
2005-12-14T15:00:00.000Z	franfar	jdier	- yes, I found that place on System>Preferences>Sesions>Programs at startup right?
2005-12-14T15:00:00.000Z	jdier	franfar	 you want the <System> menu  from there you want the <Preferences> menu from there choose <Sessions>
2005-12-14T15:00:00.000Z	jdier	franfar	you are rocking now!!!
2005-12-14T15:01:00.000Z	franfar	jdier	- thanks!
2005-12-14T15:03:00.000Z	jdier	franfar	- click the add button then type <gdesklests> in the Startup command box
2005-12-14T15:05:00.000Z	franfar	jdier	- ok, what about the order? (it says 50), I left it as is.
2005-12-14T15:05:00.000Z	jdier	franfar	- I left mine along at 50
2005-12-14T15:06:00.000Z	franfar	jdier	thank you very much for your help, you've been very nice!
2005-12-14T15:07:00.000Z	jdier	franfar	- I am a newbie too.  I just happened to have figured out that exact thing last week.
