2010-04-30T11:52:00.000Z	KeithWeisshar		the download is stalled
2010-04-30T11:52:00.000Z	KeithWeisshar		i'm installing into vbox
2010-04-30T11:52:00.000Z	KeithWeisshar		the network light in vbox isn't flashing
2010-04-30T11:54:00.000Z	KeithWeisshar		i'm doing a clean install on a blank virtualbox drive
2010-04-30T11:55:00.000Z	KeithWeisshar		why is the the retreiving file process stalled during the install?
2010-04-30T11:55:00.000Z	KeithWeisshar		the install won't finish if the donwload is stalled
2010-04-30T11:55:00.000Z	KeithWeisshar		does the installer need to download updates during installation?
2010-04-30T11:56:00.000Z	KeithWeisshar		how can i disconnect the installer from the net
2010-04-30T11:57:00.000Z	KeithWeisshar		does the installer use the internet to download additonal software
2010-04-30T11:57:00.000Z	KeithWeisshar		no
2010-04-30T11:57:00.000Z	maco	KeithWeisshar	you can disconnect using the network manager widget at the top of the screen
2010-04-30T11:58:00.000Z	maco	KeithWeisshar	the internet is not required for installation
2010-04-30T11:58:00.000Z	maco	KeithWeisshar	it /can/ pull from the net if you choose a language thats not on the cd (the dvd has more languages, i think) but iirc there should be a "skip" button
2010-04-30T11:58:00.000Z	maco	KeithWeisshar	though skip button may be a kubuntu thing... hmm
2010-04-30T11:59:00.000Z	maco	KeithWeisshar	then it could be pulling updates. either way there's a network manager icon at the top of your screen. thatll let you disconnect from the internet
2010-04-30T12:00:00.000Z	maco	KeithWeisshar	oh...there is one other case where it can pull.... thats if a bug is found in the installer, the installer can download a new version of itself. but again, disconnecting the internet will prevent that
2010-04-30T12:01:00.000Z	maco	KeithWeisshar	not in kubuntu. i dont know about ubuntu.  but kubuntu's making the installer window disappear (but still finish the install i believe) is a known bug
2010-04-30T12:02:00.000Z	maco	KeithWeisshar	check the release notes. if there's no mention of it, youre fine
2010-04-30T12:02:00.000Z	maco	KeithWeisshar	or "should be" fine
