2011-01-25T12:30:00.000Z	sam-_-	anirvana	there are a few limitations. for example you can't upgrade.
2011-01-25T12:30:00.000Z	sam-_-	anirvana	i had a wubi installation going corrupt because the system crashed. so i'm not a fan.
2011-01-25T12:32:00.000Z	sam-_-	anirvana	i don't understand. the upgrade goes from where to where?
2011-01-25T12:33:00.000Z	sam-_-	anirvana	i'm afraid no
2011-01-25T12:34:00.000Z	anirvana	sam-_-	:and for installing ubuntu I need to create one free drive on my system?
2011-01-25T12:34:00.000Z	sam-_-	anirvana	doesn't have to be free. just needs to be xfs/ext2-4/reiserfs etc...
2011-01-25T12:35:00.000Z	sam-_-	anirvana	and about 4gb
2011-01-25T12:35:00.000Z	sam-_-	anirvana	of free space
2011-01-25T12:36:00.000Z	anirvana	sam-_-	:how do I check if it's xfs/ext2-4/reiserfs ?
2011-01-25T12:36:00.000Z	sam-_-	anirvana	your existing install?
2011-01-25T12:37:00.000Z	anirvana	sam-_-	:+ ubuntu 32 bit on wubi
2011-01-25T12:38:00.000Z	sam-_-	anirvana	it's wubi? so then you can't install on this drive anyway.
2011-01-25T12:39:00.000Z	sam-_-	anirvana	it's possible but rly. shouldn't be done
2011-01-25T12:41:00.000Z	anirvana	sam-_-	,Jordon_U , Just to make it clear, I am going to install ubuntu 64 from scratch, I'll do a boot time install and ubuntu would offer me to compress my existing drive and I wouldn't loose any data?
2011-01-25T12:41:00.000Z	sam-_-	anirvana	correct
2011-01-25T12:41:00.000Z	sam-_-	anirvana	backup your data though :-)
2011-01-25T12:42:00.000Z	sam-_-	anirvana	also you can resize the windows partition in windows via computer manager
2011-01-25T12:42:00.000Z	sam-_-	anirvana	diskmgmt.msc
2011-01-25T12:42:00.000Z	sam-_-	anirvana	some say it is a bit safer
