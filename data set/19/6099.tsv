2008-03-28T10:57:00.000Z	kindofabuzz		i really haven't found a definate answer
2008-03-28T10:58:00.000Z	kindofabuzz		according to dd-wrt, impossible
2008-03-28T10:58:00.000Z	kindofabuzz		like you said, up to v4
2008-03-28T10:59:00.000Z	kindofabuzz		but i've also been reading it's very hard to get it to talk to a linksys router
2008-03-28T10:59:00.000Z	kindofabuzz		belkin to belkin it could work though
2008-03-28T10:59:00.000Z	kindofabuzz		yeah
2008-03-28T11:00:00.000Z	kindofabuzz		hehe, actually i forgot, i did brick one, i took it back to walmart and just said it doesn't work, they gave me another
2008-03-28T11:01:00.000Z	davenull	kindofabuzz	un related, the routers att sells, you can take the wifi radio out of it, mini-pci, and put it in a lappy for two wifi cards and use it as a bridge
2008-03-28T11:01:00.000Z	kindofabuzz	davenull	cool
2008-03-28T11:02:00.000Z	davenull	kindofabuzz	in reality, its cheaper to buy a range extender than that, but this was more fun
2008-03-28T11:02:00.000Z	kindofabuzz	davenull	yeah i thought about that, but i wanna geek out and use this router
2008-03-28T11:02:00.000Z	davenull	kindofabuzz	thats the spirit
2008-03-28T11:03:00.000Z	davenull	kindofabuzz	if you want to have a real geekout, build an ipcop box
2008-03-28T11:04:00.000Z	kindofabuzz	davenull	i'll look that up
2008-03-28T11:04:00.000Z	kindofabuzz	davenull	actually yeah i been wanting to do that, i got an old 486
2008-03-28T11:05:00.000Z	davenull	kindofabuzz	beautiful, full firewall and dns, dhpc, intrusion detection. and then you can just run a cat5 to the router and use it a standalone access point
2008-03-28T11:05:00.000Z	kindofabuzz	davenull	wow cool
2008-03-28T11:06:00.000Z	davenull	kindofabuzz	my router has been moved about 50 feet from the modem, it doesnt do any dhcp or firewalling
