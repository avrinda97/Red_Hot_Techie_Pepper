2007-01-08T17:27:00.000Z	rizenine	uberspaced	why?
2007-01-08T17:27:00.000Z	uberspaced	rizenine	the dependancy is kindof busted;
2007-01-08T17:28:00.000Z	rizenine	uberspaced	no, just use ndiswrapper 1.8
2007-01-08T17:28:00.000Z	uberspaced	rizenine	yeah, i know that now
2007-01-08T17:28:00.000Z	rizenine	uberspaced	it will install commons

2007-01-08T17:29:00.000Z	uberspaced	rizenine	now i just need apt to work so i can install stuff.
2007-01-08T17:29:00.000Z	rizenine	uberspaced	you also know to run ndiswrapper-1.8 right instead of just ndiswrapper
2007-01-08T17:29:00.000Z	uberspaced	rizenine	yes, i know, i got that working.  now i have other crappy issues.
