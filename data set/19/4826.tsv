2008-12-13T06:13:00.000Z	Alejo-Expat		hi, i'Â¡ve always been a happy ubuntu user, but my ubuntu 8.04 is so slow that it's unusable. I've googled and i've seen people complain, but i haven't seen any solutions. What do i do?
2008-12-13T06:15:00.000Z	Alejo-Expat		what is the solution to the massive slowdown in ubuntu?
2008-12-13T06:17:00.000Z	Alejo-Expat		ubuntu has become so horribly slow that i can't use it. What do i do?
2008-12-13T06:18:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Alejo-Expat	What flavor of ubuntu are you running, and what all have you added from outside official repos?
2008-12-13T06:19:00.000Z	Alejo-Expat	Jack_Sparrow	it's 8.04 hardy, and i have added nothing
2008-12-13T06:20:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Alejo-Expat	what flavor of ubuntu and can you pastebin your sources.list for us.. NOT in the channel
2008-12-13T06:24:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Alejo-Expat	did you upgrade through all version of jump from feisty to hardy
2008-12-13T06:24:00.000Z	Alejo-Expat	Jack_Sparrow	i skipped 7.10. I went from 7.04 to 8.04
2008-12-13T06:25:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Alejo-Expat	BAd mojo.. you cant do that
2008-12-13T06:25:00.000Z	Alejo-Expat	Jack_Sparrow	i just told it to upgrade, shouldn't it be clever enough to either do it smoothly or tell me: you can't do that!    ?
2008-12-13T06:26:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Alejo-Expat	if you change the sources and tell it to upgrade it will try to do it
2008-12-13T06:26:00.000Z	Alejo-Expat	Jack_Sparrow	i didn't mess with the sources, i promise
2008-12-13T06:26:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Alejo-Expat	k, sources.list looks a bit odd
2008-12-13T06:30:00.000Z	Alejo-Expat	Jack_Sparrow	so what can i do? It's driving me crazy, and after 4 and 1/2 years of using ubuntu i'm pissed off enough to go back to windows. I didn't mess with it. I just clicked on the button offering me to upgrade to the newest version.
2008-12-13T06:30:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Alejo-Expat	install your last backup
2008-12-13T06:31:00.000Z	Alejo-Expat	Jack_Sparrow	as in.. my last system backup ?
2008-12-13T06:31:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Alejo-Expat	if you have used ubuntu for 4.5 years and never had a backup and never had to reinstall , windows is sure to disappoint
2008-12-13T06:34:00.000Z	Alejo-Expat	Jack_Sparrow	no, i had to reinstall it 20 billion times. Granted, left often than windows. But still a lot. And it doesn't take a phd to install your sound or your video card. I have advocated ubuntu for years, but i'm really angry at the moment
2008-12-13T06:35:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Alejo-Expat	So no backups?  Sorry you are frustrated , but this is not the place to vent your frustration
