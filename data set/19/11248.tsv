2006-03-06T11:21:00.000Z	_jason	Klick_	use srate=48000 if you want to keep alsa
2006-03-06T11:21:00.000Z	Klick_		haha -ao ass
2006-03-06T11:22:00.000Z	_jason	Klick_	ass :P you mean oss?
2006-03-06T11:22:00.000Z	Klick_		thats what im thining about mplayer at the moment
2006-03-06T11:22:00.000Z	_jason	Klick_	just put srate=48000 in ~/.mplayer/config, works fine for me
2006-03-06T11:23:00.000Z	Klick_		well using oss worked.. but that srate=48000 idnt unless im doing it wrong, is this right
2006-03-06T11:23:00.000Z	Klick_		mplayer -vo xv -ao alsa srate=48000 /data/Videos/Breakdancing\ -\ Kollaboration\ 2003\ -\ David\ Elsewhere\ Bernal.mpeg
2006-03-06T11:23:00.000Z	_jason	Klick_	the option would be '-srate 48000'
2006-03-06T11:24:00.000Z	Klick_		ahh cool, thanks a ton!
2006-03-06T11:24:00.000Z	_jason	Klick_	but just put that stuff in ~/.mplayer/config so you don't type it all the time, the syntax looks like 'srate=48000' and you can put the vo an ao stuff there too
2006-03-06T11:26:00.000Z	Klick_	_jason	ok that works perfect one more small thing maybe is easy for you to help me fix, on some videos i get this when i try to play them

2006-03-06T11:27:00.000Z	_jason	Klick_	you have w32codecs?
2006-03-06T11:27:00.000Z	Klick_	_jason	I believe so how do i tell
2006-03-06T11:28:00.000Z	_jason	Klick_	good question, depends on how you installed them.  does 'ls /usr/lib/win32/' show a lot of files?
2006-03-06T11:28:00.000Z	Klick_	_jason	yes, i downloaded the CVS all codec respository and coppied them all to there, and also to /usr/local/lib/codecs/
2006-03-06T11:29:00.000Z	_jason	Klick_	don't know then, try #mplayer if no one else here can help you out
