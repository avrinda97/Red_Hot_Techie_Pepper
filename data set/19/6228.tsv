2008-02-23T10:19:00.000Z	Housefly7k		my compiz doesnt work, although Beryl worked on Fiesty, after installing gutsy it just would not work tried everything possible
2008-02-23T10:19:00.000Z	prohna	Housefly7k	thats weird cause i had the exact opposite problem lol
2008-02-23T10:22:00.000Z	prohna	Housefly7k	what does it do? can you enable any compiz effects?
2008-02-23T10:24:00.000Z	Housefly7k	prohna	no, none if i try from the System -> pref -> Appearance to enable Visual effects
2008-02-23T10:24:00.000Z	Housefly7k	prohna	 then it doesnt work it just says it was not able to switch or something like that, wait let me try
2008-02-23T10:25:00.000Z	prohna	Housefly7k	install the compiz config manager
2008-02-23T10:26:00.000Z	Housefly7k	prohna	"Desktop effects could not be enabled"
2008-02-23T10:27:00.000Z	Housefly7k	prohna	installing now
2008-02-23T10:27:00.000Z	Housefly7k	prohna	although i have pretty much given up hope
2008-02-23T10:28:00.000Z	Housefly7k	prohna	installed ccsm
2008-02-23T10:30:00.000Z	Housefly7k	prohna	but what would installing ccsm help if the basic desktop effects wont work?
2008-02-23T10:31:00.000Z	prohna	Housefly7k	idk worth a shot
2008-02-23T10:31:00.000Z	prohna	Housefly7k	mine acted wacky till i got it working
2008-02-23T10:32:00.000Z	prohna	Housefly7k	especially switching that setting yer trying to change would lock me up for 15+ seconds sometimes
2008-02-23T10:34:00.000Z	Housefly7k	prohna	so now that ccsm is installed...should i disable all the effects and try enabling some? is that what you suggest....and what effects should i try first?
2008-02-23T10:35:00.000Z	prohna	Housefly7k	does it let you open ccsm?
2008-02-23T10:36:00.000Z	Housefly7k	prohna	yeah
2008-02-23T10:36:00.000Z	prohna	Housefly7k	try some of them then
2008-02-23T10:37:00.000Z	Housefly7k	prohna	but the desktop effects are not enabled...i am not sure i understand
