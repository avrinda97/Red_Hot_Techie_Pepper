2006-12-04T06:21:00.000Z	LordGoth		I could use some help
2006-12-04T06:23:00.000Z	LordGoth		is a j2re hard to load on this distro?
2006-12-04T06:25:00.000Z	LordGoth		ok, so just rpm it like I usually do or is there some special sequence I have to use?
2006-12-04T06:26:00.000Z	LordGoth		I see.
2006-12-04T06:26:00.000Z	LordGoth		this is weird. I've never used Debian or anything like it.
2006-12-04T06:26:00.000Z	LordGoth		it was either Mandrake, or SuSe.
2006-12-04T06:27:00.000Z	LordGoth		is Ubuntu better than its low-end cousin or does it make a difference?
2006-12-04T06:28:00.000Z	LordGoth		I tried installing Ubuntu, but it kept slogging out at 59% -.-
2006-12-04T06:29:00.000Z	LordGoth		and since I'm not a Debian user, this is all new to Me.
2006-12-04T06:30:00.000Z	sc4ttrbrain	LordGoth	sorry, but have u check the cd itself? maybe corrupted ...
2006-12-04T06:32:00.000Z	sc4ttrbrain	LordGoth	if u mean accesssing ur windows partition from linux, yes u can
2006-12-04T06:33:00.000Z	sc4ttrbrain	LordGoth	what do u mean?
2006-12-04T06:34:00.000Z	sc4ttrbrain	LordGoth	its all the same, suse and ubuntu just have different package
2006-12-04T06:35:00.000Z	LordGoth	sc4ttrbrain	what do I use to pull then in Debian?
2006-12-04T06:36:00.000Z	sc4ttrbrain	LordGoth	with anything u want, we have also konquerror if u want
2006-12-04T06:36:00.000Z	LordGoth	sc4ttrbrain	just install konqueror then, and do it like I used to?
2006-12-04T06:37:00.000Z	sc4ttrbrain	LordGoth	yes :D
2006-12-04T06:37:00.000Z	sc4ttrbrain	LordGoth	if u use konqueror in suse, big chance u use kde, so i suggest u use kubuntu,instead of ubuntu
2006-12-04T06:44:00.000Z	LordGoth	sc4ttrbrain	thanks for your help. you too, x-r00t-x.
