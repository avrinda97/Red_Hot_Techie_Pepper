2007-11-30T12:20:00.000Z	allenc		Hi, my sound was working fine in Ubuntu and now it doesn't.  How do I re-install sound drivers?
2007-11-30T12:21:00.000Z	soldats	allenc	when and how did this happen
2007-11-30T12:21:00.000Z	allenc	soldats	tonight.  I don't know if it was related to the update that ubuntu installed or not.
2007-11-30T12:22:00.000Z	soldats	allenc	have you restarted alsa
2007-11-30T12:23:00.000Z	allenc	soldats	I have rebooted but know nothing about alsa
2007-11-30T12:25:00.000Z	soldats	allenc	try typing "/etc/init.d/alsamixer restart" in a terminal
2007-11-30T12:25:00.000Z	soldats	allenc	or just alsamixer restart
2007-11-30T12:26:00.000Z	allenc	soldats	bash: /etc/init.d/alsamixer: No such file or directory
2007-11-30T12:26:00.000Z	soldats	allenc	type cd then type alsamixer restart
2007-11-30T12:27:00.000Z	allenc	soldats	it brings up a screen with level bars on it
2007-11-30T12:28:00.000Z	soldats	allenc	yes it should have restarted it now turn all the levels up and see if it worked
2007-11-30T12:28:00.000Z	allenc	soldats	how do I move from one to the other?
2007-11-30T12:30:00.000Z	allenc	soldats	ok turned all up.  sound pref tab is still open and is locked up.
2007-11-30T12:31:00.000Z	soldats	allenc	try this "/etc/rc.d/init.d/alsasound stop" then do this "/etc/rc.d/init.d/alsasound start"
2007-11-30T12:32:00.000Z	allenc	soldats	no such command or directory
2007-11-30T12:33:00.000Z	soldats	allenc	hmm i have no clue why that command isnt working
2007-11-30T12:33:00.000Z	allenc	soldats	I don't seem to have that directory, are you sure it's the correct one?
2007-11-30T12:36:00.000Z	allenc	soldats	should I just re-install ubuntu?
