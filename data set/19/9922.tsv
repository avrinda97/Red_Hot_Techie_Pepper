2006-09-01T16:16:00.000Z	jazzrocker		esd isn't actually even running right now
2006-09-01T16:16:00.000Z	jazzrocker		even though "enable sound system" is checked in GNOME
2006-09-01T16:16:00.000Z	jazzrocker		does gnome not use ESD anymore?
2006-09-01T16:18:00.000Z	minimec	jazzrocker	Hmm... Is it installed by default? At least in Debian esd is not installed by default
2006-09-01T16:18:00.000Z	jazzrocker	minimec	so wtf does gnome use for the sound system and where/how do i configure it by hand cuz the GUI sucks
2006-09-01T16:20:00.000Z	minimec	jazzrocker	it uses alsa. the esd module is a kind of sound server. Try 'sudo apt-get install esd'
2006-09-01T16:20:00.000Z	jazzrocker	minimec	so how do i configure gnome to not use alsa and use OSS instead
2006-09-01T16:21:00.000Z	minimec	jazzrocker	use alsa in combination with esd.
2006-09-01T16:21:00.000Z	jazzrocker	minimec	ummmm
2006-09-01T16:21:00.000Z	minimec	jazzrocker	why can't you use alsa?
2006-09-01T16:24:00.000Z	minimec	jazzrocker	I don't know if 'esd' handels OSS. I don't think so.
2006-09-01T16:24:00.000Z	jazzrocker	minimec	well does gnome use esd or not? if not then that doesn't matter.
2006-09-01T16:26:00.000Z	minimec	jazzrocker	You can use alsa or OSS with gnome, but if you use OSS, esd will probably not work. But you will have sound. You just won't be able to listen to a CD and watch a Movie at the same time. ;)
2006-09-01T16:27:00.000Z	minimec	jazzrocker	esd is a sound server that handels different 'sound-streams' ...
2006-09-01T16:28:00.000Z	jazzrocker	minimec	actually the 4Front driver for my card provides a number of /dev/dsp devices to use as a primitive mixer
2006-09-01T16:28:00.000Z	minimec	jazzrocker	So you have sound...
2006-09-01T16:28:00.000Z	jazzrocker	minimec	yes indeed
2006-09-01T16:28:00.000Z	jazzrocker	minimec	gaim and amarok both
2006-09-01T16:29:00.000Z	minimec	jazzrocker	ok. but you would like to have the gaim sounds, while listening to a CD :_)
