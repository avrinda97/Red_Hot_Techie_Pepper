2006-10-29T11:30:00.000Z	Corbo		hello
2006-10-29T11:30:00.000Z	Corbo		can anyone spare a few minutes for a new ubuntu user?
2006-10-29T11:31:00.000Z	Corbo		thanks lostat, I have an NTFS drive, I have mounted it and can access it in the terminal as root, but don't have permission to access it as a user in gnome, how can I give myself permission?
2006-10-29T11:32:00.000Z	Corbo		yes, I just want to get in to it and copy the files out of it lostat
2006-10-29T11:33:00.000Z	lostat1	Corbo	is it a one time copy/
2006-10-29T11:30:00.000Z	lostat1	Corbo	just ask
2006-10-29T11:33:00.000Z	lostat1	Corbo	Or is this a permanent drive for storage you will use allot.
2006-10-29T11:39:00.000Z	lostat1	Corbo	go to a command line in a terminal. And try this out: sudo chmod 777 -R /media/usbdisk or usbdisk1
2006-10-29T11:40:00.000Z	Corbo	lostat1	that has set all permissions in it to read only, but I can still only access it as root, not as myself
2006-10-29T11:41:00.000Z	lostat1	Corbo	can you PVT?
2006-10-29T11:45:00.000Z	lostat1	Corbo	Why not open nautilus up from a command line. sudo nautilus and then copy the contents of the NTFS drive to /home/whomever and then reformat with a more compatible drive format?
2006-10-29T11:49:00.000Z	lostat1	Corbo	You are attempting to access an External USB HD or an internal SCSI or IDE hard-drive that is not the primary drive and is formatted in foul NTFS?
2006-10-29T11:50:00.000Z	Corbo	lostat1	I am trying to access an NTFS sata drive, local to the machine.  I can access it, but most folders are showing "The folder contents could not be displayed" when I open them
2006-10-29T11:53:00.000Z	lostat1	Corbo	Stupid question but those files that show the error were they at all pgp or ntfs protected?
2006-10-29T12:03:00.000Z	lostat1	Corbo	what r u trying.
2006-10-29T12:05:00.000Z	lostat1	Corbo	So take that NTFS drive make it master and copy those files to CD or copy them to another slave drive
2006-10-29T12:06:00.000Z	lostat1	Corbo	You know what i mean?
2006-10-29T12:08:00.000Z	lostat1	Corbo	Do you have a winxp machine around? Use the SATA drive as a slave on that to copy to cD
2006-10-29T12:08:00.000Z	lostat1	Corbo	Sorry I am of no use on this. I have ot get ready for a formal dinner. If your on later tell me how it goes
