2007-09-04T13:38:00.000Z	clearzen		I'm getting a file size limit exceeded error with dd. Does anyone know why this happens?
2007-09-04T13:39:00.000Z	sauvin	clearzen	I assume you're making an image and storing it in a file?
2007-09-04T13:40:00.000Z	sauvin	clearzen	the resulting file is too large for the filesystem on which you're storing that image.
2007-09-04T13:41:00.000Z	clearzen	sauvin	How do I break it into pieces with dd then?
2007-09-04T13:45:00.000Z	clearzen	sauvin	It's a fat32 system. The drive itself shows up as W95 Ext'd (LBA) with fdisk as well.
2007-09-04T13:48:00.000Z	sauvin	clearzen	would it be an option to make the image on an ext3 volume and then copy it AFTER you've seen what size it really is?
2007-09-04T13:48:00.000Z	clearzen	sauvin	The drive itself is 100GB's give or take 20GB
2007-09-04T13:52:00.000Z	clearzen	sauvin	no. I was just naming the ouput file with the extension .iso
2007-09-04T13:52:00.000Z	sauvin	clearzen	so what's the image you're making?
2007-09-04T13:53:00.000Z	clearzen	sauvin	It's a clone of a partition on a hard drive
2007-09-04T13:54:00.000Z	sauvin	clearzen	what size is that partition?
2007-09-04T13:54:00.000Z	clearzen	sauvin	It is about 100GB
2007-09-04T13:54:00.000Z	sauvin	clearzen	you're not going to get a 100GB image onto a FAT filesystem.
2007-09-04T13:55:00.000Z	clearzen	sauvin	can I break it into 2GB files and then use cat to put it together
2007-09-04T13:56:00.000Z	sauvin	clearzen	you might be able to do something similar, but I believe dd only knows how to make a single monolithic image; the chunking will happen afterwards.
2007-09-04T13:56:00.000Z	sauvin	clearzen	the folks on #linux may have a better idea.
2007-09-04T13:57:00.000Z	clearzen	sauvin	Okay, I'll look around. But if worse comes to worse then I can format the destination drive ext3
2007-09-04T13:57:00.000Z	sauvin	clearzen	that might be your best option. I don't remember what the filesize limit on ext3 is, but it's a hella bigger than some damn 2GB.
