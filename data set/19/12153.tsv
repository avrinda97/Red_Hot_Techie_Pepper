2007-01-23T11:55:00.000Z	juicyfish		I have some source for an application I'd like to install, however, I am clueless as how to compile source to be able to use it.
2007-01-23T11:55:00.000Z	juicyfish		Anyone have any information on compiling source with Ubuntu?
2007-01-23T11:55:00.000Z	Ruffles	juicyfish	u'll need the package build-essential
2007-01-23T11:55:00.000Z	juicyfish	IdleOne	Just a vocoder application for audio.
2007-01-23T11:56:00.000Z	juicyfish		Installing package now.
2007-01-23T11:56:00.000Z	juicyfish		Done.
2007-01-23T11:57:00.000Z	juicyfish		What is the next step I need to take?
2007-01-23T11:57:00.000Z	Ruffles	juicyfish	./configure ?
2007-01-23T11:57:00.000Z	juicyfish		Ah. That was simple. :P
2007-01-23T11:58:00.000Z	juicyfish		Unfortunately there is no configure file.
2007-01-23T11:58:00.000Z	juicyfish		It is still source.
2007-01-23T11:59:00.000Z	juicyfish		Is there some step to compile/build the code into a binary I can use? o.O
2007-01-23T11:59:00.000Z	Ruffles	juicyfish	remember to always search the desired program on the repositories before compiling anything
2007-01-23T11:59:00.000Z	juicyfish		This is some little vocoder written for SuSE
2007-01-23T11:59:00.000Z	juicyfish		Doubt Synaptic would have had it.
2007-01-23T11:59:00.000Z	Ruffles	juicyfish	apt-cache search what_you_want
2007-01-23T12:00:00.000Z	juicyfish		It was tested successfully for Ubuntu, though. But I'll check.
2007-01-23T12:00:00.000Z	juicyfish		Not found.
2007-01-23T12:01:00.000Z	Ruffles	juicyfish	the common steps are ./configure, make, make install
