2007-06-23T16:12:00.000Z	HardDisk		evening folks, I'd like to know, and I did try google first, why ubuntu decided to bork and not read either my cd drives unless I have to restart the pc, reads a cd, when i eject and insert another one doesn't show on desktop.
2007-06-23T16:12:00.000Z	crabgrass	HardDisk	sudo mount /dev/cdrom /media/cdrom0
2007-06-23T16:12:00.000Z	crabgrass	HardDisk	or whatever the correct params for your system are
2007-06-23T16:13:00.000Z	HardDisk		but it was doing it automagically
2007-06-23T16:13:00.000Z	HardDisk		it would show a CD icon on the desktop
2007-06-23T16:13:00.000Z	crabgrass		SUP /g/ !
2007-06-23T16:15:00.000Z	HardDisk		crabgrass nope nothing
2007-06-23T16:16:00.000Z	crabgrass	HardDisk	try mount
2007-06-23T16:16:00.000Z	crabgrass	HardDisk	see if it's on there
2007-06-23T16:16:00.000Z	HardDisk		no it isnt
2007-06-23T16:17:00.000Z	HardDisk	crabgrass	like I said it was working fine, then decided not to work.
2007-06-23T16:17:00.000Z	crabgrass	HardDisk	between reboots>?
2007-06-23T16:18:00.000Z	HardDisk	crabgrass	well it loads a cd when I boot, when i insert a different cd doesnt work, and I have two drives, same thing
2007-06-23T16:18:00.000Z	crabgrass	HardDisk	did you unmount before ejecting?
2007-06-23T16:19:00.000Z	HardDisk	crabgrass	I did remove acetone2 and installed nautilus scripts to mount/unmount
2007-06-23T16:19:00.000Z	crabgrass	HardDisk	might be something with the script then
2007-06-23T16:19:00.000Z	crabgrass	HardDisk	maybe
2007-06-23T16:19:00.000Z	HardDisk	crabgrass	possible.  I will try again, thanx btw.
