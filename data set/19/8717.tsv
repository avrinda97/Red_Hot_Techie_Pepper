2007-08-10T07:47:00.000Z	sgtmattbaker		http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33226/plain/ I have an issue with my 8800GTS videocard I think in relation to Ubuntu
2007-08-10T07:49:00.000Z	sipior	sgtmattbaker	i don't think your partition corruption issues can be traced to the graphics card. i must confess i
2007-08-10T07:49:00.000Z	sipior	sgtmattbaker	i'm a little concerned: i just got a 8800GTS for my new system, and was going to install ubuntu tonight :)
2007-08-10T07:49:00.000Z	sgtmattbaker	sipior	I know, but wat about my system beep, and the glitchy things at the BIOS?
2007-08-10T07:50:00.000Z	sipior	sgtmattbaker	possible. is the system adequately ventilated for this card? it draws ~100 watts peak.
2007-08-10T07:51:00.000Z	sipior	sgtmattbaker	the heat might be problematic for the system, and would result in strange behaviour
2007-08-10T07:53:00.000Z	sipior	sgtmattbaker	also, have you seen this thread: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=3137136
2007-08-10T07:53:00.000Z	sipior	sgtmattbaker	the issue is not power supply, it is heat mitigation :)
2007-08-10T07:54:00.000Z	sipior	sgtmattbaker	is this a new card, btw?
2007-08-10T07:54:00.000Z	sgtmattbaker	sipior	yes it is like 2 days old
2007-08-10T07:55:00.000Z	sgtmattbaker	sipior	but why would I only get a system beep when restarting from the livecd?  I have 3 or 4 case fans, and a huge zalman CPU fan with a 5" diameter
2007-08-10T07:55:00.000Z	sipior	sgtmattbaker	do you have on-board video to test with?
2007-08-10T07:55:00.000Z	sgtmattbaker	sipior	no
2007-08-10T07:56:00.000Z	sipior	sgtmattbaker	then cooling is probably not an issue, but of course i don't know the details of your system a priori
2007-08-10T07:56:00.000Z	sipior	sgtmattbaker	you might consider plugging in an older card to get going, installing the latest nvidia drivers and reinstall
2007-08-10T08:00:00.000Z	sipior	sgtmattbaker	the graphical glitches at the bios screen are anotehr matter. i thought we were talking about the blank screen later?
2007-08-10T08:01:00.000Z	sgtmattbaker	sipior	yeah I dont care about edgy, I know that is a driver issue.  I care about the continuous system beep when I hit restart while in teh feisty livecd and it only stops beeping when it gets to the BIOS screen
2007-08-10T08:03:00.000Z	sipior	sgtmattbaker	might be worth contacting customer support. you said you had problems under windows as well? could the card be bad?
