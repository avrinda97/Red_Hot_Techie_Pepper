2005-11-23T10:33:00.000Z	Daniel_Libanori	mustard5	It is about gdm.conf, it wanna to know if I want to preserver it
2005-11-23T10:34:00.000Z	mustard5	Daniel_Libanori	what are you installing that is changing your gdm.conf?

2005-11-23T10:34:00.000Z	Daniel_Libanori	mustard5	sorry, new version gdm
2005-11-23T10:35:00.000Z	mustard5	Daniel_Libanori	I would think you should preserve your old gdm.conf
2005-11-23T10:35:00.000Z	mustard5	Daniel_Libanori	maybe it wants to reset it to default, but that might mean you lose your personal settings.
2005-11-23T10:36:00.000Z	Daniel_Libanori	mustard5	ok, I was waiting about 15 minutes, but now it pop up the question in my  gnome
2005-11-23T10:37:00.000Z	mustard5	Daniel_Libanori	I would keep your old settings personally
2005-11-23T10:37:00.000Z	Daniel_Libanori	mustard5	it was too late
2005-11-23T10:37:00.000Z	Daniel_Libanori	mustard5	I keep it
