2009-02-10T21:46:00.000Z	ArcSighter		I got "Failed to set servicePrincipalNames. Please ensure that the DNS domain of this server matches the AD domain, Or rejoin with using Domain Admin credentials" Waht's going on?
2009-02-10T21:47:00.000Z	mick02	ArcSighter	what exactly are you trying to do?
2009-02-10T21:47:00.000Z	ArcSighter	mick02	trying to join to a ADS domain using samba/winbind
2009-02-10T21:48:00.000Z	mick02	ArcSighter	is it a Windows Domain
2009-02-10T21:48:00.000Z	ArcSighter	mick02	a w2k3 ad domain
2009-02-10T21:48:00.000Z	mick02	ArcSighter	why don't you just use Likewise ... www.likewise.com
2009-02-10T21:49:00.000Z	ArcSighter	mick02	I want to join this linux server to the AD domain
2009-02-10T21:49:00.000Z	ArcSighter	mick02	and I got that error
2009-02-10T21:52:00.000Z	mick02	ArcSighter	it sounds like there's something wrong in your config files
2009-02-10T21:53:00.000Z	ArcSighter	mick02	it isn't a desktop
2009-02-10T21:53:00.000Z	mick02	ArcSighter	I never said that it was
2009-02-10T21:54:00.000Z	ArcSighter	mick02	the error is telling that my dns name in the server doesn't match the dns of the AD domain, what should I try?
2009-02-10T21:54:00.000Z	mick02	ArcSighter	have you even looked at Likewise? They provide a command line utility to join domains ... why don't you just take a look at it and then if it doesn't do what you're looking for come back to me
2009-02-10T21:54:00.000Z	mick02	ArcSighter	have you got a Windows box attached to the domain?
2009-02-10T21:55:00.000Z	ArcSighter	mick02	yes of course I do
2009-02-10T21:55:00.000Z	ArcSighter	mick02	I'll go lunch to get new strengths I come back shorly
2009-02-10T21:55:00.000Z	ArcSighter	mick02	yes of course I have the name, I'm network coadmin
2009-02-10T21:56:00.000Z	ArcSighter	mick02	please pv me
2009-02-10T21:56:00.000Z	mick02	ArcSighter	I probably won't be here, but check out that link I sent you
