2010-11-05T02:06:00.000Z	allowoverride		most users will not be going to cmdline in a gui world
2010-11-05T02:06:00.000Z	allowoverride		however, if you have some suggestions, without threat of losing my data on this card, im all ears
2010-11-05T02:06:00.000Z	PhantomString	allowoverride	Depend on GUI, expect fail.  Just my 2 cents
2010-11-05T02:07:00.000Z	allowoverride	PhantomString	lol. yah, but it worked before on last 10.04 version
2010-11-05T02:07:00.000Z	allowoverride	PhantomString	im using Gnome
2010-11-05T02:18:00.000Z	PhantomString	allowoverride	 Not sure why you need one.  Ubuntu is mainly gui unless you go ubuntu server.
2010-11-05T02:19:00.000Z	allowoverride	PhantomString	??? are you saying take away the cmd line from a linux user on his desktop? lolol
2010-11-05T02:19:00.000Z	PhantomString	allowoverride	You have to see the pattern.  Ubuntu is going further away from cmdline.  If you wish, you can control your services from commandline but a GUI will be started anyways UNLESS you remove gdm
2010-11-05T02:25:00.000Z	allowoverride	PhantomString	cmdline is necessary if the gui fails for example... and to keep users  from learning command is a bad move... but i see your point i guess, i just dont agree with it.  for example, i have found in the GUI if you have a wireless connection issue, i simply do a sudo Network-Restart, since unchecking the little handy box in Network-Manager on the sysbar, that never works by the way...  so you see, service restar
2010-11-05T02:26:00.000Z	PhantomString	allowoverride	But that logic can be used on any operating system.  I can run powershell on windows and you could argue that the GUI on M$ is a frontend to the cmdline
2010-11-05T02:26:00.000Z	allowoverride	PhantomString	why would i argue any point that has to do with windoze
2010-11-05T02:27:00.000Z	PhantomString	allowoverride	No one said you shouldn't use cmdline at all.  Your references were involving a Sys V like 'runlevel' system but on Ubuntu, it doesn't work like that.
2010-11-05T02:27:00.000Z	allowoverride	PhantomString	i heard you the first time
2010-11-05T03:57:00.000Z	PhantomString	allowoverride	use dmesg
2010-11-05T04:03:00.000Z	allowoverride	PhantomString	yep
2010-11-05T04:06:00.000Z	allowoverride	PhantomString	explain a little more... messages show it is working, and i would think as a mod as i pasted in bin
2010-11-05T04:06:00.000Z	PhantomString	allowoverride	is the package usb-modeswitch, installed?
2010-11-05T04:07:00.000Z	allowoverride	PhantomString	ill double check, im pretty sure it is. sb
2010-11-05T04:08:00.000Z	allowoverride	PhantomString	yes it is
