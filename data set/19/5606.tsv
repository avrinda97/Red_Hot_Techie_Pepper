2008-07-22T01:50:00.000Z	glitsj16		moldy: current stable kernel in 8.04.1 is already at 2.6.24-19, and there's 2.6.24-20 in hardy-proposed
2008-07-22T01:51:00.000Z	moldy_	glitsj16	what do i have to do to see the .19? aptitude search does not show it
2008-07-22T01:52:00.000Z	moldy_	glitsj16	oh, i just read that i need 2.6.25 actually. can i install this whithout compiling it myself?
2008-07-22T01:52:00.000Z	glitsj16	moldy_	that one you will have to compile yourself yes, i think only intrepid has that
2008-07-22T01:53:00.000Z	moldy_	glitsj16	it's not possible to use a backport of the kernel from intrepid?
2008-07-22T01:54:00.000Z	glitsj16	moldy_	might be possible yes, might also create dependency hell .. is there anything special you need the -25 for ?
2008-07-22T01:54:00.000Z	moldy_	glitsj16	yes, the NIC in a thin client
2008-07-22T01:55:00.000Z	moldy_	glitsj16	the driver in .24 is broken, and earlier kernels seem to have other fatal issues :-/
2008-07-22T01:55:00.000Z	moldy_	glitsj16	seems to be this bug: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/229113
2008-07-22T01:56:00.000Z	moldy_	glitsj16	out of curiosity: why do i not see the 24-19 kernel?
2008-07-22T01:56:00.000Z	glitsj16	moldy_	i see, well, it's either compile yourself or if you have the spare HD space you could install Intrepid and test it from there
2008-07-22T01:57:00.000Z	glitsj16	moldy_	you might have to look at your sources.list and check which repositories you have active in there, you should see it at least
2008-07-22T01:59:00.000Z	moldy_	glitsj16	ah, now i see the driver. how painful is a hardy  -> intrepid upgrade ?
2008-07-22T01:59:00.000Z	moldy_		s/driver/kernel
2008-07-22T01:59:00.000Z	glitsj16		moldy: there is no upgrade from hardy to intrepid yet, as INtrepid is still in alpha testing fase
2008-07-22T02:00:00.000Z	moldy_	glitsj16	ok, thanks for your help.
2008-07-22T02:00:00.000Z	moldy_		i will either buy the other client or compile the kernel myself.
2008-07-22T02:02:00.000Z	glitsj16	moldy_	you're welcome .. ask around in #ubuntu+1 for intrepid
2008-07-22T02:02:00.000Z	moldy_	glitsj16	ok, thanks
