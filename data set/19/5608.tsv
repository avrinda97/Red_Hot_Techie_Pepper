2008-06-03T15:42:00.000Z	PastorBones		when denyhosts does a block, where does it store that info and how do I remove it?
2008-06-03T15:42:00.000Z	thefish	PastorBones	it is probably in hosts.deny
2008-06-03T15:43:00.000Z	thefish	PastorBones	but removing it from there will not help, you will need to whitelist the ip
2008-06-03T15:43:00.000Z	thefish	PastorBones	because next time it runs, it will see all the failures, and re-add it :)
2008-06-03T15:44:00.000Z	thefish	PastorBones	check the docs, i cant remember exactly, but its pretty easy
2008-06-03T15:44:00.000Z	thefish	PastorBones	you have a serial connection?
2008-06-03T15:45:00.000Z	thefish	PastorBones	you could "bounce" there
2008-06-03T15:45:00.000Z	thefish	PastorBones	get a free shell somewhere and use that
2008-06-03T15:45:00.000Z	thefish	PastorBones	or get a trusted friend to do it for you
2008-06-03T15:45:00.000Z	thefish	PastorBones	of course, after that change the password and have the friend killed
2008-06-03T15:46:00.000Z	thefish	PastorBones	your ip is blocked, getting another ip will let you in
2008-06-03T15:46:00.000Z	thefish	PastorBones	ah ok important info that
2008-06-03T15:47:00.000Z	thefish	PastorBones	check hosts.*
2008-06-03T15:49:00.000Z	thefish	PastorBones	then its not denyhosts, unless you have a very interesting config
2008-06-03T15:49:00.000Z	thefish	PastorBones	ssh -vvv host will give you more detail as to why you cant get in
2008-06-03T15:50:00.000Z	thefish	PastorBones	why you say "get to the site" do you mean browse some web pages, or log on with ssh?
2008-06-03T15:53:00.000Z	PastorBones	thefish	I can telnet to the domain.com 80 get the index.php but my browser gives network timeout
2008-06-03T15:54:00.000Z	thefish	PastorBones	then your browser is the problem, have you tried using the ip address in your browser?
2008-06-03T15:56:00.000Z	thefish	PastorBones	i think maybe you have dns issues then - so you have 2 apache vhosts on that box?
