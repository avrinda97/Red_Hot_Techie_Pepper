2007-08-19T05:13:00.000Z	finalbeta		Thunderbird is not maintained much?!?
2007-08-19T05:13:00.000Z	Downsay	finalbeta	are you familiar with thunderbird?
2007-08-19T05:13:00.000Z	finalbeta	Downsay	yes
2007-08-19T05:14:00.000Z	Downsay	finalbeta	have you tried thunderbird 3.0 yet?  I've heard you can browse the net with it just as firefox?
2007-08-19T05:14:00.000Z	finalbeta	Downsay	mozilla moved it away, that doesn't mean it's not maintained.
2007-08-19T05:14:00.000Z	finalbeta		I haven't used the 3.0
2007-08-19T05:15:00.000Z	Downsay	finalbeta	is there a way it can be used as your browser as well that you've experienced?
2007-08-19T05:15:00.000Z	finalbeta	Downsay	no...
2007-08-19T05:16:00.000Z	Downsay	finalbeta	is a POP server supposed to be more secure?  what are the perks to using tbird?
2007-08-19T05:17:00.000Z	finalbeta	Downsay	I find it more practical then evolution, that's all. no perks.. I used it in windows, now I use it in linux
2007-08-19T05:18:00.000Z	Downsay	finalbeta	did you recently make the switch from windows to linux?
2007-08-19T05:18:00.000Z	Downsay	finalbeta	I've never used a client like this before...figured I'd try it out
2007-08-19T05:18:00.000Z	finalbeta	Downsay	about a year ago.
2007-08-19T05:19:00.000Z	finalbeta		I like the way thunderbird has a show images button, it's safe that way
2007-08-19T05:19:00.000Z	Downsay	finalbeta	how are you finding the switch?  Are you used to everything in Linux now?  I just made the switch 4 days ago and I have so much to learn...want to learn all about Wine and the capabilities within Linux itself
2007-08-19T05:21:00.000Z	finalbeta	Downsay	for me linux is better in some way, worse in many other ways. I'm a windows admin at work, this is more a hobby OS for me. For my hardware it's lacking, but for home usage it does what I need it to do.
2007-08-19T05:21:00.000Z	Downsay	finalbeta	ahh, makes sense:)
2007-08-19T05:22:00.000Z	finalbeta	Downsay	the best thing about linux is that you see it improving. hope keeps me on it.
