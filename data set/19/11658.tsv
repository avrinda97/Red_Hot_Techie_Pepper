2005-12-14T14:35:00.000Z	MWettendorff		this n00b here is in badly need of help from some one that can help with instructions to apache/php/mysql setup
2005-12-14T14:36:00.000Z	diesel	MWettendorff	ask your question
2005-12-14T14:39:00.000Z	diesel	MWettendorff	How did you install apache/php5/mysql?
2005-12-14T14:43:00.000Z	diesel	MWettendorff	 https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ApacheMySQLPHP
2005-12-14T14:44:00.000Z	diesel	MWettendorff	You're on the right track, but still missing some things...specificaly libapache2-mod-php5
2005-12-14T14:46:00.000Z	diesel	MWettendorff	I would not install ftp if all you want to do is work on MySQL.  I would install phpmyadmin which will allow you to work on MYSQL from any browser anywhere
2005-12-14T14:48:00.000Z	diesel	MWettendorff	one other thing...spelling my nick would be nice so that I can see that you are chatting directly with me
2005-12-14T14:48:00.000Z	diesel	MWettendorff	why do you want to install FTP?  For what purpose?
2005-12-14T14:49:00.000Z	MWettendorff	diesel	want to be abel to upload webpages from my main PC.
2005-12-14T14:50:00.000Z	diesel	MWettendorff	cool, now I can tell that you are speaking directly to me...If you want a secure and easy way to upload web pages from a windows pc to your ubuntu box I would look into installing WinSCP on windows and ssh server on ubuntu
2005-12-14T14:57:00.000Z	MWettendorff	diesel	let me do 1 thing at the time. im a old man, and my fuches burns over a litle easy, when it comes to Linux..
2005-12-14T14:58:00.000Z	diesel	MWettendorff	Have you installed libapache2-mod-php5 to get php5 to work with Apache2?
2005-12-14T14:59:00.000Z	MWettendorff	diesel	not yet.. im reading the guide you gave a link to...
2005-12-14T15:00:00.000Z	MWettendorff	diesel	is there a way that i can uninstall it all, so i can follow that guide right down to the dot?
2005-12-14T15:02:00.000Z	diesel	MWettendorff	You could probably just start from where you are at the moment and follow the guide
2005-12-14T15:03:00.000Z	MWettendorff	diesel	if i can figure out where that is :)
2005-12-14T15:07:00.000Z	MWettendorff	diesel	i just ran  sudo bin/mysql_install_db --user=mysql and now it sais that i have to copy some support-files/mysql.server to the right place. how adn where do i finde thoes?? (If that is something i need to do)
2005-12-14T15:10:00.000Z	diesel	MWettendorff	I don't know the answer to your question...sorry
