2011-11-01T17:14:00.000Z	digitalfiz		hey guys I have a remote VM I need to resize the partitions on how can I do this?
2011-11-01T17:14:00.000Z	digitalfiz		I don't have access to console but I had the IT department make the drive larger in VMWare
2011-11-01T17:14:00.000Z	digitalfiz		they refuse to work on linux so I have to resize it myself
2011-11-01T17:16:00.000Z	histo	digitalfiz	you'd have to unmount the partitions and grow them somehow
2011-11-01T17:16:00.000Z	digitalfiz	histo	I can't do that from SSH though can I?
2011-11-01T17:16:00.000Z	histo	digitalfiz	hrm....
2011-11-01T17:17:00.000Z	histo	digitalfiz	can you boot the vm to a live cd?
2011-11-01T17:17:00.000Z	digitalfiz	histo	I don't access to console
2011-11-01T17:18:00.000Z	histo	digitalfiz	how'd you install the distro on the vm?
2011-11-01T17:19:00.000Z	digitalfiz	histo	I built it locally and sent the vm files to my support department and they booted it
2011-11-01T17:20:00.000Z	histo	digitalfiz	without booting the vm to a live cd or something I can't think of a way to do it. Perhaps someone else can.
2011-11-01T17:21:00.000Z	histo	digitalfiz	what partitions are you planningon resizing?
2011-11-01T17:21:00.000Z	digitalfiz	histo	its ext3
2011-11-01T17:22:00.000Z	digitalfiz	histo	it was originally a 10gb partition I want to make 40gb
2011-11-01T17:22:00.000Z	histo	digitalfiz	is everything on one / partition?
2011-11-01T17:22:00.000Z	digitalfiz	histo	yes
2011-11-01T17:26:00.000Z	histo	digitalfiz	you could create a seperate partition with the freespace then mount that to part of the filesystem.
2011-11-01T17:27:00.000Z	histo	digitalfiz	can't you have them boot the vm to an iso and then go fromthere?
2011-11-01T17:33:00.000Z	digitalfiz	histo	I am going to walk the IT department through a live cd/gparted solution on a few test servers then go with the live server
