2005-06-14T12:16:00.000Z	lsuactiafner		i run firefox in a chroot
2005-06-14T12:16:00.000Z	lsuactiafner		too much effort to get it to work in hoary
2005-06-14T12:18:00.000Z	lsuactiafner		1.0.2 has a bug thats exploitable as far as i know..
2005-06-14T12:18:00.000Z	lsuactiafner		so yar..
2005-06-14T12:18:00.000Z	lsuactiafner		1.0.4 or doesnt run firefox
2005-06-14T12:18:00.000Z	thoreauputic	lsuactiafner	no, the Ubuntu version has been fixed
2005-06-14T12:20:00.000Z	thoreauputic	lsuactiafner	read what bob2  and I just said
2005-06-14T13:22:00.000Z	thoreauputic	lsuactiafner	ubotu has a factoid for that URL - it's !restricted
2005-06-25T15:08:00.000Z	thoreauputic	lsuactiafner	bad advice - there's a Debian way for kernels
2005-06-25T15:10:00.000Z	thoreauputic	lsuactiafner	that would be why ubuntu.com runs on ubuntu...
2005-07-18T11:42:00.000Z	thoreauputic	lsuactiafner	mplayer is fine, but sometimes people have more luck with xine or vlc - it depends
2005-07-18T15:10:00.000Z	thoreauputic	lsuactiafner	we've kind of covered that ground...
2005-07-18T15:16:00.000Z	thoreauputic	lsuactiafner	and ubuntu developers recommend users like you dont figure out how to compile your own kernel btw <-- not true, as long as people read the debian howto on compiling kernels
2005-07-18T15:18:00.000Z	thoreauputic	lsuactiafner	erm... that sounds... apocryphal shall we say
2005-07-18T15:20:00.000Z	thoreauputic	lsuactiafner	if you watch crimsun at work on sound issues you'll see he can usually do wonders with kernel headers, and no recompile at all
2005-07-29T06:25:00.000Z	thoreauputic	lsuactiafner	I think my solution is less trouble ;-)
2005-07-29T06:25:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	thoreauputic	: yeh
2005-09-16T06:02:00.000Z	thoreauputic	lsuactiafner	no, sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg is the "Debian Way"
2005-09-16T06:34:00.000Z	thoreauputic	lsuactiafner	you are totally off topic
