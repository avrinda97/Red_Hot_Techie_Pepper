2006-07-18T14:01:00.000Z	osfameron		how do I format an external drive ?
2006-07-18T05:40:00.000Z	osfameron		wooot!  finished my backup via rsync
2006-07-18T05:40:00.000Z	osfameron		what's the best way to verify a backup?   rsync?
2006-07-18T05:40:00.000Z	osfameron		er
2006-07-18T05:40:00.000Z	osfameron		I mean dirdiff?
2006-07-18T05:41:00.000Z	frogzoo	osfameron	restore somewhere else & diff -r if you've space
2006-07-18T05:41:00.000Z	osfameron	frogzoo	hmmm, not really gonna happen for space :-(
2006-07-18T05:42:00.000Z	frogzoo	osfameron	no, it's a luxury - but maybe pipe to md5 ?
2006-07-18T05:42:00.000Z	osfameron	frogzoo	testing your backups is a luxury?  Or you mean diff -r across filesystems is too heavy?
2006-07-18T05:43:00.000Z	frogzoo	osfameron	space to restore a full backup is a luxury
2006-07-18T05:43:00.000Z	frogzoo	osfameron	it's a pet peeve
2006-07-18T05:44:00.000Z	osfameron	frogzoo	the thing is, I've been, for example,. receiving emails and stuff in the mean time. Nothing I necessarily want to backup (e.g. email is still on server) but it will affect an md5sum of the whole caboodle, so I have to think about the granularity
2006-07-18T05:45:00.000Z	frogzoo	osfameron	just restore a decent sample sized chunk & diff -r
2006-07-18T05:49:00.000Z	osfameron	frogzoo	will diff -r now work from local to USB drive?
2006-07-18T05:52:00.000Z	frogzoo	osfameron	as long as you can read from the USB disk, sure
2007-01-17T14:55:00.000Z	frogzoo	osfameron	the core 2 duo lappies look sweet
2007-01-17T14:55:00.000Z	osfameron	frogzoo	not sure about the keyboards though
2007-01-17T14:56:00.000Z	frogzoo	osfameron	yeah, dunno, not in the market for a new lappie yet
2007-01-17T14:56:00.000Z	osfameron	frogzoo	I would be except I just ordered a Nokia N800 tablet, and that ate into my gadget budget a bit
