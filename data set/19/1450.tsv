2011-01-20T01:09:00.000Z	SeeQue		hello all... anyone here who can help me with changing the default permissions on Ubuntus automount drives (inserting a usbstick) ?
2011-01-20T01:09:00.000Z	JackyAlcine	SeeQue	It's usually in Nautilus, System > Prefrences > File Management
2011-01-20T01:10:00.000Z	SeeQue	JackyAlcine	dont seem to have any "File Management" there ?
2011-01-20T01:11:00.000Z	JackyAlcine	SeeQue	open Nautlius and then Edit > Preferences.
2011-01-20T01:13:00.000Z	SeeQue	JackyAlcine	cant see what exactly im looking for there
2011-01-20T01:14:00.000Z	JackyAlcine	SeeQue	what happened to your fonts?
2011-01-20T01:14:00.000Z	SeeQue	JackyAlcine	my fonst ??
2011-01-20T01:14:00.000Z	JackyAlcine	SeeQue	isn't that what you're asking help for?
2011-01-20T01:15:00.000Z	SeeQue	JackyAlcine	no, i might have been a bit unclear... i was looking for at way to give all users access to my USB-stick when it get automountet after i insert it
2011-01-20T01:16:00.000Z	JackyAlcine	SeeQue	you should put everyone under a certain group 'automount' and allow them access to mount and unmount drives.
2011-01-20T01:16:00.000Z	JackyAlcine	SeeQue	It's in the Users and Groups preference.
2011-01-20T01:18:00.000Z	SeeQue	JackyAlcine	hmm... i can create the group but i see no way of setting any group rules in there
2011-01-20T01:21:00.000Z	SeeQue	JackyAlcine	ok :)
2011-01-20T01:21:00.000Z	SeeQue	JackyAlcine	anyway i could use it if i just could give the www-data user access to any automountet usb that i have inserted
2011-01-20T01:22:00.000Z	SeeQue	JackyAlcine	but i dont see the www-data user in the user/group management
2011-01-20T01:23:00.000Z	JackyAlcine	SeeQue	I don't know *too much* about account administration in Linux.
2011-01-20T01:24:00.000Z	SeeQue	JackyAlcine	any idea what file i have to look in to change the www-date users group or permission settings instead ?
2011-01-20T01:24:00.000Z	JackyAlcine	SeeQue	no, sorry. Try searching the forums.
2011-01-20T01:25:00.000Z	SeeQue	JackyAlcine	ok... but thanks for the help anyway ;-)
