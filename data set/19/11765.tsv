2006-07-03T05:14:00.000Z	deemo		hey everyone, i have been following the following instructions to fix my boot loader: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows but when i try to set the root it tells me the Selected Disk does not exist
2006-07-03T05:14:00.000Z	deemo		anyone know whats wrong? im doing root (hd0,0) and my / is mounted on hda1
2006-07-03T05:14:00.000Z	mwe	deemo	that windows
2006-07-03T05:15:00.000Z	mwe	deemo	or not?
2006-07-03T05:15:00.000Z	mwe	deemo	on a dual boot windows is usually hda1
2006-07-03T05:16:00.000Z	deemo	mwe	on my box, i have hda2 set as my ntfs partition. hda1 is ext3
2006-07-03T05:17:00.000Z	mwe	deemo	I thought windows would insist on installing on the first partition on the first drive usually. but ok
2006-07-03T05:17:00.000Z	deemo	mwe	i dont know, i dont think so
2006-07-03T05:17:00.000Z	mwe	deemo	ok then
2006-07-03T05:18:00.000Z	mwe	deemo	the grub shell should let you tab complete though
2006-07-03T05:19:00.000Z	deemo	mwe	it has tab completion for the commands but if i do root (hd and press tab it wont work
2006-07-03T05:20:00.000Z	mwe	deemo	then I think it doesn't recognize it. it should let you usually I think
2006-07-03T05:20:00.000Z	deemo	mwe	hmm alright ill try some other things i guess
2006-07-03T05:20:00.000Z	mwe	deemo	are you doing it from the live cd or what?
2006-07-03T05:21:00.000Z	deemo	mwe	yes from live cd, but im going to try and do it through the rescue console in the main menu of the live cd
2006-07-03T05:21:00.000Z	mwe	deemo	is the live cd able to mount your linux partition?
2006-07-03T05:21:00.000Z	deemo	mwe	yes i have mounted it
2006-07-03T05:21:00.000Z	mwe	deemo	odd then
