2009-02-02T14:36:00.000Z	remoteCTR1	scizzo-	that would be this: http://nopaste.org/p/aqKEHaZ5d
2009-02-02T14:32:00.000Z	scizzo-	remoteCTR1	maybe you could tell us a little more about what exactly is the permission problem
2009-02-02T14:33:00.000Z	remoteCTR1	scizzo-	i am trying to backup my workstation to an nfs mounted volume, if i do it as user i get access errors on the workstation (perm ission denied), if i do it with gksudo i get the permission problems on the nfs-volume... how can i solve that?
2009-02-02T14:34:00.000Z	scizzo-	remoteCTR1	pastebin what the mount command gives you
2009-02-02T14:34:00.000Z	remoteCTR1	scizzo-	the mount command works perfect, gives nothing in return
2009-02-02T14:34:00.000Z	scizzo-	remoteCTR1	I don't believe that comment
2009-02-02T14:35:00.000Z	remoteCTR1	scizzo-	well what do you want me to paste then?
2009-02-02T14:35:00.000Z	scizzo-	remoteCTR1	what I mean is: Type "mount" only in the terminal......not anything else and pastebin the output
2009-02-02T14:35:00.000Z	remoteCTR1	scizzo-	ah! hehe, sec pls
2009-02-02T14:37:00.000Z	scizzo-	remoteCTR1	ls -d /backup
2009-02-02T14:38:00.000Z	remoteCTR1	scizzo-	klaus@katana:~$ ls -d /backup
2009-02-02T14:39:00.000Z	scizzo-	remoteCTR1	right I wanna know the permissions on /backup
2009-02-02T14:40:00.000Z	remoteCTR1	scizzo-	drwxr-xr-x   2 nobody nogroup  4096 2009-02-02 10:32 backup
2009-02-02T14:40:00.000Z	scizzo-	remoteCTR1	that explains a lot
2009-02-02T14:40:00.000Z	remoteCTR1	scizzo-	the nobody nogroup thingie i guess you mean right?
2009-02-02T14:41:00.000Z	scizzo-	remoteCTR1	well part of it yes
2009-02-02T14:41:00.000Z	remoteCTR1	scizzo-	point is: if i use it as my nomral user. ie. klauis it works just fine, but i cant execute rsync as user as that as said before returns me "permission denied's" on my filesystem
2009-02-02T14:43:00.000Z	scizzo-	remoteCTR1	rsync is something I don't know much of...however my question would then be if its the source dir or the dest dir that gives the error
2009-02-02T14:44:00.000Z	remoteCTR1	scizzo-	that depends on what user i execute it with; if as user then the local filesystem gives the permission denieds, if as superuser the nfs-volume mocks
