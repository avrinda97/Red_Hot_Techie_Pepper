2011-04-03T05:36:00.000Z	tristan325		hi everyone, i'm new to ubuntu.  i'm using it now from the trial installed on my usb
2011-04-03T05:36:00.000Z	tristan325		i really like it and want to install
2011-04-03T05:36:00.000Z	edbian	tristan325	So install it!
2011-04-03T05:36:00.000Z	edbian	tristan325	What are you curious about?
2011-04-03T05:37:00.000Z	edbian	tristan325	sure...
2011-04-03T05:37:00.000Z	edbian	tristan325	Please type everything on one line
2011-04-03T05:39:00.000Z	edbian	tristan325	then do that.
2011-04-03T05:40:00.000Z	edbian	tristan325	yeah so.
2011-04-03T05:40:00.000Z	edbian	tristan325	How much space do you want for each OS?
2011-04-03T05:40:00.000Z	edbian	tristan325	Ubuntu needs at the MOST 10Gb plus your personal files
2011-04-03T05:41:00.000Z	edbian	tristan325	yes.  It just uses the entire drive.  But you have to split the drive in 'half'
2011-04-03T05:42:00.000Z	edbian	tristan325	FILES refers to all of your windows OS
2011-04-03T05:43:00.000Z	edbian	tristan325	If you go into manual mode its clearer about what you're doing
2011-04-03T05:43:00.000Z	edbian	tristan325	Sure?  What does option3 say?
2011-04-03T05:44:00.000Z	edbian	tristan325	Linux rocks
2011-04-03T05:45:00.000Z	edbian	tristan325	then don't give it that much
2011-04-03T05:45:00.000Z	edbian	tristan325	You can always boot a live CD later and re-arrange again
2011-04-03T05:46:00.000Z	edbian	tristan325	hurray
