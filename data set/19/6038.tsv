2008-03-26T08:20:00.000Z	xb3rt		Does anyone know of any 'good' network diagraming programs for linux, I can't seem to find anything decent
2008-03-26T08:21:00.000Z	lanoxx	xb3rt	nmap
2008-03-26T08:21:00.000Z	xb3rt	lanoxx	does that allow creating diagrams, or does it just simply map out the network im on
2008-03-26T08:25:00.000Z	lanoxx	xb3rt	no just gives you console output of the pcs in a network
2008-03-26T08:25:00.000Z	xb3rt	lanoxx	im looking for something along the lines of smartdraw or visio, but for linux
2008-03-26T08:25:00.000Z	lanoxx	xb3rt	that makes it pretty easy to see who is up and resonds, you can scan every thing or just see if a host is up.
2008-03-26T08:26:00.000Z	lanoxx	xb3rt	sorry, in that case i dont know, you could install crossover office and get visio running, worked pretty well for me.
2008-03-26T08:27:00.000Z	xb3rt	lanoxx	ive got a copy of smartoffice, but its locked up on my 'mybook' drive right now, which id also like to get working
2008-03-26T08:27:00.000Z	lanoxx	xb3rt	why is it locked up?
2008-03-26T08:28:00.000Z	xb3rt	lanoxx	its connected to my wireless router with an ethernet cable, which makes it wireless,...but beins that im on linux Its not able to pick it up
2008-03-26T08:28:00.000Z	xb3rt	lanoxx	it also needs special software i beleive, which right now is only windows compatible
2008-03-26T09:13:00.000Z	lanoxx	xb3rt	what do you want to know?
2008-03-26T09:14:00.000Z	xb3rt	lanoxx	how to use it
2008-03-26T09:17:00.000Z	xb3rt	lanoxx	with nmap is it possible to scan my isps network?
2008-03-26T09:27:00.000Z	lanoxx	xb3rt	with traceroute
2008-03-26T09:27:00.000Z	lanoxx	xb3rt	try traceroute www.google.com to see how it works
