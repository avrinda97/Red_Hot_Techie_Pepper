2009-11-04T00:08:00.000Z	garymaurizi		i shouldent have too tell you to do this
2009-11-04T00:10:00.000Z	garymaurizi		im not trying too be condescending, nor was i being--i dont appreciate you saying that too me its kind of rude
2009-11-04T00:11:00.000Z	garymaurizi		and i don't see what right you have too insult me? furthermore
2009-11-04T00:13:00.000Z	garymaurizi		Sorry mMezquitale: you are correct. I was feeding the troll
2009-11-04T00:14:00.000Z	garymaurizi		is gnome keyring installed with karmic koala by default?
2009-11-04T00:15:00.000Z	Pici	garymaurizi	I believe it is.
2009-11-04T00:15:00.000Z	garymaurizi	Pici	where is the wallet manager ?
2009-11-04T00:15:00.000Z	garymaurizi		I can not find it anywhere
2009-11-04T00:16:00.000Z	garymaurizi		Speculator: if that option exists in compiz I have not seen it yet.
2009-11-04T00:16:00.000Z	Pici	garymaurizi	'wallet manager'?.  I think theres an application that might fit this in Applications>Accessories.  I don't have a GUI system in front of me to check the exact name though. I think it may have been called Encryption and Password.
2009-11-04T00:17:00.000Z	garymaurizi	Pici	thanks ill look now
2009-11-04T00:17:00.000Z	Pici	garymaurizi	As FCalderon said: Passwords and encryption keys
2009-11-04T00:18:00.000Z	garymaurizi		Pici:FCalderon: This is nothing like the gnome-keyring & wallet manager in ubuntu 9.04, nor does this look associated at all with gnome-keyring?
2009-11-04T00:21:00.000Z	Pici	garymaurizi	Are you perhaps thinking of kwalletmanager ? Thats a KDE application and is not installed by default with Ubuntu.
2009-11-04T00:21:00.000Z	garymaurizi	Pici	perhaps, but there was a very similiar app in gnome too
