2008-08-16T18:23:00.000Z	Bangers		hi I just started using Ubuntu
2008-08-16T18:23:00.000Z	Bangers		Why do fonts suck soo much? I think I did the msstfont package, but even things like youtube still look really bad
2008-08-16T18:23:00.000Z	Bangers		what am I doing wrong?
2008-08-16T18:24:00.000Z	dz__	Bangers	Go to Appearance -> Fonts and change to
2008-08-16T18:25:00.000Z	Bangers	dz__	where do i change that?
2008-08-16T18:26:00.000Z	dz__	Bangers	Click the font name and it'll bring up a list of available fonts.
2008-08-16T18:26:00.000Z	dz__	Bangers	then choose DejaVu Sans for each one EXCEPT Window title font (DejaVu Bold) and Fixed-width font (monospace)
2008-08-16T18:27:00.000Z	Bangers	dz__	Oh ok, ok 1 sec let me try
2008-08-16T18:28:00.000Z	Bangers	dz__	which "style" do I apply to the Dejavu Sans?
2008-08-16T18:28:00.000Z	dz__	Bangers	Styles? Do you mean rendering?
2008-08-16T18:29:00.000Z	Bangers	dz__	possibly.  in 'fonts' it says "Family" which I select Dejavu Sans then "Style" to the right (Bold, etc)
2008-08-16T18:29:00.000Z	dz__	Bangers	Ah - choose Book.
2008-08-16T18:29:00.000Z	dz__	Bangers	And for WIndows-title font, choose Bold
2008-08-16T18:32:00.000Z	dz__	Bangers	Try making sure your rendering options are as follows: Click all of the 4 options (Monochrome, Best Shapes, Best Contrast, Subpixel smoothing)
2008-08-16T18:32:00.000Z	dz__	Bangers	Then go into Details
2008-08-16T18:33:00.000Z	dz__	Bangers	and choose Subpixel and Slight
2008-08-16T18:33:00.000Z	dz__	Bangers	Then test the fonts again
2008-08-16T18:34:00.000Z	Bangers	dz__	Well, my fonts in ubuntu look nice, in the GUI
2008-08-16T18:36:00.000Z	dz__	Bangers	Sorry i can't help any further - I have to get going. Try someone else or try a google search. :)
