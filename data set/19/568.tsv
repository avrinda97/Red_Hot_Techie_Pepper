2011-12-17T00:31:00.000Z	lolol^		My eog (eye of gnome) is broken
2011-12-17T00:31:00.000Z	soreau	lolol^	How did you break it?
2011-12-17T00:32:00.000Z	lolol^	soreau	Don't know...
2011-12-17T00:33:00.000Z	lolol^	soreau	I even reinstalled the eog package...
2011-12-17T00:33:00.000Z	soreau	lolol^	What happens when you try to run it from terminal?
2011-12-17T00:34:00.000Z	lolol^	soreau	Sth like "Timelimit reached"
2011-12-17T00:35:00.000Z	soreau	lolol^	Can you pastebin the complete output to paste.ubuntu.com?
2011-12-17T00:36:00.000Z	lolol^	soreau	Exactly this one line
2011-12-17T00:36:00.000Z	soreau	lolol^	It just says "Timelimit reached" and returns?
2011-12-17T00:37:00.000Z	lolol^	soreau	"GLib-GIO-CRITICAL **: Zeit√ºberschreitung wurde erreicht"
2011-12-17T00:37:00.000Z	lolol^	soreau	Yes, with this prefix...
2011-12-17T00:39:00.000Z	lolol^	soreau	Just found this: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1869052&page=2
2011-12-17T00:40:00.000Z	soreau	lolol^	Yea I'm finding reports too
2011-12-17T00:42:00.000Z	soreau	lolol^	This seems to suggest downgrading glib to a stable version will fix it https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/eog/+bug/880227
2011-12-17T00:43:00.000Z	soreau	lolol^	and it has a new version of eog with a fix
2011-12-17T00:47:00.000Z	lolol^	soreau	Seems a restart is also needed... Going down for restart...
2011-12-17T00:48:00.000Z	lolol^	soreau	Upgrading to newer eog version is working fine!
2011-12-17T00:54:00.000Z	soreau	lolol^	Cool ;-)
