2005-03-18T10:22:00.000Z	JordanAU		Hello, I am cleaning off space on my hard drive to install ubuntu for the first time
2005-03-18T10:23:00.000Z	JordanAU		i have been spending some time reading up on linux and i have a partitioning question
2005-03-18T10:24:00.000Z	JordanAU		should i partition anything more than 1 partition and a swap or should i sererate my root etc
2005-03-18T10:24:00.000Z	JordanAU		sererate/seperate
2005-03-18T10:25:00.000Z	JordanAU		what is a recommended partitioning scheme for ubuntu?
2005-03-18T10:26:00.000Z	crimsun	JordanAU	the default is fine unless you wish to exercise more control and/or have specific requirements
2005-03-18T10:29:00.000Z	crimsun	JordanAU	you could also use wine or cedega to play it in Linux if you have an Nvidia or an ATI graphics card
2005-03-19T07:18:00.000Z	crimsun	JordanAU	for ubuntu, you use linux-headers-$(uname -r)
2005-03-19T07:18:00.000Z	crimsun	JordanAU	not kernel-headers-foo, which is what debian uses
2005-03-19T07:19:00.000Z	JordanAU	crimsun	i downoaded this file <linux-2.6.8.1.tar.gz> on my windows boot and was going to tar it, is that wrong?
2005-03-19T07:20:00.000Z	crimsun	JordanAU	that's upstream vanilla source
2005-03-19T07:20:00.000Z	crimsun	JordanAU	you can just apt-get install linux-source-2.6.8.1
2005-03-19T07:20:00.000Z	crimsun	JordanAU	what's preventing you from getting online?
2005-03-19T07:22:00.000Z	crimsun	JordanAU	well, since you're online now, you'll find the instructions here: http://www.ubuntulinux.org/support/documentation/howto/ndiswrapper
2005-03-19T07:22:00.000Z	crimsun	JordanAU	in particular, scroll down to the bottom of the page and read the post entitled "It's not that hard"
2005-03-19T07:23:00.000Z	crimsun	JordanAU	you don't have to compile anything
2005-03-19T07:24:00.000Z	JordanAU	crimsun	thank you, i have done that before and it tells me there is no command called ndis wrapper
2005-03-19T07:24:00.000Z	crimsun	JordanAU	did you follow the directions?
2005-03-19T07:26:00.000Z	JordanAU	crimsun	okay i think i installed the source package, not the utils package
