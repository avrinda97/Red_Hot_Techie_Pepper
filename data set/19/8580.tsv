2008-06-18T07:53:00.000Z	RabidWeezle		according to photobucket's site, they got hacked, and in order to see photobucket again you need to in windows type in ipconfig /flushdns, is there a way to flush the dns in linux?
2008-06-18T07:54:00.000Z	KyleK	RabidWeezle	i dont think it actually caches properly
2008-06-18T07:55:00.000Z	RabidWeezle	KyleK	basically, my inlaw's visited photobucket when it was being hacked, and they can't access it now
2008-06-18T07:55:00.000Z	KyleK		ah
2008-06-18T07:55:00.000Z	RabidWeezle	KyleK	the dns needs to be flushed
