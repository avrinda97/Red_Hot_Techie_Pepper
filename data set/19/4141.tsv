2009-08-13T14:45:00.000Z	WeazelON	ActionParsnip	there is no browser i've seen that has a full screen like chromium, its just the page in fullscreen
2009-08-13T14:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	WeazelON	IE is ok in F11 fullscreen. I use opera personally
2009-08-13T14:46:00.000Z	WeazelON	ActionParsnip	dude, if fullscreen is your bag, you should really check the fullscreen there
2009-08-13T14:46:00.000Z	WeazelON	ActionParsnip	in Chromium that is of course
2009-08-13T14:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	WeazelON	i dont use alpha software

2009-08-13T14:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	WeazelON	if you want speed, try LXDE :D
2009-08-13T14:49:00.000Z	WeazelON	ActionParsnip	maybe i will, but currently i'm too excited to switch browsers :D
