2008-06-26T20:00:00.000Z	genii		Hmm. Why does the bot not know about an LTS that is still good?
2008-06-26T20:00:00.000Z	babolat	genii	i just need to know if ITALC comes with dapper's synaptic
2008-06-26T20:00:00.000Z	genii	babolat	At any rate you can install italc-client or italc-server. Yes
2008-06-26T20:01:00.000Z	babolat	genii	you mean from source codE?
2008-06-26T20:02:00.000Z	genii	babolat	No, it is a binary. Bur if you wanted the source code the usual way is to:    apt-get source <packagenamehere>
2008-06-26T20:02:00.000Z	babolat	genii	where do i get those binaries?
2008-06-26T20:02:00.000Z	genii	babolat	Um... use the package manager to install either italc-client  package  or italc-server package
2008-06-26T20:02:00.000Z	babolat	genii	so it _is_ in the main dapper repository?
2008-06-26T20:03:00.000Z	babolat	genii	that's in dapper right?
2008-06-26T20:03:00.000Z	genii	babolat	Yes, dapper (6.06.1) reports to me these packages are available
2008-06-26T20:03:00.000Z	babolat	genii	thanks
2008-06-26T20:06:00.000Z	babolat	genii	last question.. stupid one I think.. Does Dapper have System > Admin > Synaptic Package Manager ?
2008-06-26T20:07:00.000Z	genii	babolat	Use Add/Remove Programs which should just want to open Synaptic by default
2008-06-26T20:08:00.000Z	babolat	genii	Will that require universe and multiverse enabled?
2008-06-26T20:09:00.000Z	genii	babolat	Since the bot is thinking dappedr is not a valid distribution it is not telling me the repository for that one. But it should be same place on other dists. 1 sec
