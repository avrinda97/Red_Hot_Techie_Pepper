2008-08-31T14:50:00.000Z	qmunke		anyone able to help with grub issues? getting an error 15 and would appreciate some assistance walking through configuring fstab and menu.lst and whatever else it is causing the issue
2008-08-31T14:51:00.000Z	ikonia	qmunke	fstab is nothing to do with grub
2008-08-31T14:54:00.000Z	ikonia	qmunke	grub error 15 is normally down to grub being setup against the wrong partition
2008-08-31T14:54:00.000Z	ikonia	qmunke	how many disks do you have in your system ?
2008-08-31T14:55:00.000Z	qmunke	ikonia	i had three physical drives, two IDE one SATA. I've disconnected the two physical IDEs since installing. in the bios this drive shows up as third ide master even when the others are disconnected (this drive has no jumpers set)
2008-08-31T14:56:00.000Z	ikonia	qmunke	connecting / disconnecting drives trying to solve a grub problem is not a good idea as it will/can change the device order
2008-08-31T14:56:00.000Z	qmunke	ikonia	yeah just ran fdisk and realised this, now read as sda instead of sdc
2008-08-31T14:56:00.000Z	ikonia	qmunke	I suggest you put your disks in how you want them - then start debugging
2008-08-31T14:57:00.000Z	qmunke	ikonia	i'm good with a single disk for now, would you recommend just re-installing rather than attempting to configure manually?
2008-08-31T14:58:00.000Z	ikonia	qmunke	no - I'd strongly suggesst put your disks in - then fix it, as soon as you put disks in a a later date you'll have issues
2008-08-31T14:59:00.000Z	qmunke	ikonia	i don't need the other disks and won't be adding any in future, this is a short/medium term install and the exisitng disk will be more than enough to be going on with.
2008-08-31T15:00:00.000Z	ikonia	qmunke	if you've not messed with / installed anything on your system, then it's quicker/easier/safer to just re-install
2008-08-31T15:00:00.000Z	qmunke	ikonia	okay, will do , thanks!
2008-08-31T15:00:00.000Z	ikonia	qmunke	if you have you ubuntu install setup as you want, then we can debug it so you don't have to install
2008-08-31T15:01:00.000Z	qmunke	ikonia	i've just done a standard install and am currently running via the livecd, if you could help debug would be appreciated
2008-08-31T15:02:00.000Z	ikonia	qmunke	have you changed anything on your install yet ?
2008-08-31T15:04:00.000Z	qmunke	ikonia	i've fiddled around with fstab and menu.lst, but as you've pointed out by removing the disks I think i've knacked my fstab - currently the entries all refer to sdc which has now become sda
2008-08-31T15:05:00.000Z	ikonia	qmunke	that it will be quicker / easier to just re-install,
2008-08-31T15:05:00.000Z	qmunke	ikonia	yeah okay, that's what i thought. thanks for the advice
