2011-01-13T04:39:00.000Z	kosmarnik		any ide where PYTHONPATH should point to?
2011-01-13T04:40:00.000Z	Gnea	kosmarnik	did you compile python?

2011-01-13T04:48:00.000Z	kosmarnik	Gnea	Ubuntu 10.04.1 LTS
2011-01-13T04:48:00.000Z	Gnea	kosmarnik	"If easy_install prints a message containing error: bad install directory or PYTHONPATH, try to use --prefix /usr in the above command."
2011-01-13T04:50:00.000Z	kosmarnik	Gnea	 easy_install --prefix /usr pyrocore  -> error: installation into /usr  ->Trying to install into the system managed parts of the file system.
2011-01-13T04:52:00.000Z	Gnea	kosmarnik	I do not know then...
2011-01-13T04:52:00.000Z	kosmarnik	Gnea	do you at least have an idea what PYTHONPATH is for? is it a lib dir or an install dir?
2011-01-13T04:56:00.000Z	Gnea	kosmarnik	I've never dealt with it, perhaps #python would know
2011-01-13T04:56:00.000Z	kosmarnik	Gnea	thanks, I'll try there
