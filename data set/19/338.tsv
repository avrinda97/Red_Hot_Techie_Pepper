2012-04-07T00:00:00.000Z	GremlynTab		I am about to do a clean install, but first I am partitioning my drive to separate /home
2012-04-07T00:01:00.000Z	GremlynTab		do I assume directly that once I have created the new partition for the OS (35GB for now) that I can just delete everything from the old position except /home?
2012-04-07T00:02:00.000Z	GremlynTab		assume correctly*
2012-04-07T00:02:00.000Z	GremlynTab		stupid autocorrect not understanding technical words...
2012-04-07T00:03:00.000Z	yeats	GremlynTab	I wouldn't delete anything you can't easily replace unless I had backups (just in general)
2012-04-07T00:03:00.000Z	GremlynTab		lshw to
2012-04-07T00:03:00.000Z	GremlynTab		too
2012-04-07T00:04:00.000Z	GremlynTab		lshw -html > hardware_info.html will give you a more readable output you can view in your browser
2012-04-07T00:05:00.000Z	GremlynTab		USB webcam?
2012-04-07T00:06:00.000Z	GremlynTab		should be shown on lspci
2012-04-07T00:06:00.000Z	GremlynTab		I think
2012-04-07T00:07:00.000Z	GremlynTab		hmm, no mine isn't
2012-04-07T00:09:00.000Z	GremlynTab		fernando, I was wrong, mine doesn't show there either it seems
2012-04-07T00:09:00.000Z	GremlynTab		looking for it now
2012-04-07T00:11:00.000Z	GremlynTab		fernando, try the lshw command
2012-04-07T00:14:00.000Z	GremlynTab	yeats	I have backed up the relevant pieces, assuming I don't screw up and delete /home
2012-04-07T00:15:00.000Z	yeats	GremlynTab	gotcha
2012-04-07T00:16:00.000Z	GremlynTab		just partitioning the drive and doing a fresh install on a new 35GB partition, wanting to keep home separate so it's easier to do fresh installs in the future
2012-04-07T00:18:00.000Z	yeats	GremlynTab	then yes, theoretically, deleting all but /home would do accomplish what you're after
