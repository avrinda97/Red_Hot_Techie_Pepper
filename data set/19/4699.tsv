2009-01-29T22:08:00.000Z	paul68		is there a good program that I can use to take remote control between a linux pc and a windows pc?
2009-01-29T22:09:00.000Z	carpii	paul68	theres a few, try vncserver or krdp
2009-01-29T22:10:00.000Z	paul68	carpii	and the vncserver needs to be installed on the windows right or am I wrong? and I can use the client version right
2009-01-29T22:10:00.000Z	carpii		yes, for vnc thats true. krdp just uses windows remote desktop
2009-01-29T22:11:00.000Z	carpii		so nothing needs installing on windows
2009-01-29T22:12:00.000Z	paul68	carpii	since the other workstation is behind a router do I need to do something specific to get through?
2009-01-29T22:13:00.000Z	carpii		yes youd need to open tcp 3389
2009-01-29T22:14:00.000Z	paul68	carpii	is there a way to do this automaticly since the workstation that I need to take control of is from someone with very little IT experience
2009-01-29T22:15:00.000Z	carpii		no, theres no automatic way. Thats the whole point of the firewall, to stop people remoting into you ;)
2009-01-29T22:16:00.000Z	carpii		theres a commercial service which lets you remote in without changing router, gotomypc.co.uk or theres a few others
2009-01-29T22:16:00.000Z	carpii		logmeinrescue.com
2009-01-29T22:16:00.000Z	carpii		?
2009-01-29T22:17:00.000Z	carpii		why is that funny?
2009-01-29T22:17:00.000Z	carpii		well maybe, but its ok for emergencies
2009-01-29T22:18:00.000Z	paul68	carpii	I agree with you there but since its my uncle its difficult to explain it the correct way
2009-01-29T22:18:00.000Z	paul68	carpii	ok thanks
2009-01-29T22:19:00.000Z	paul68		Flash its not a joke
2009-01-29T22:19:00.000Z	carpii	paul68	yup, always a problem. it might help to find his router and then read this http://portforward.com/routers.htm
2009-01-29T22:20:00.000Z	paul68	carpii	I know for me its quite simple however not for him
