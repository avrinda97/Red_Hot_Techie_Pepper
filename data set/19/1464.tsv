2011-01-15T04:35:00.000Z	KM0201	Lynxi	your best bet(especially for audio) is to install 10.10... 9.10 was a train wreck because that was when pulse audio was implemented, and the intelHDA chipsets caused lots of probs
2011-01-15T04:35:00.000Z	KM0201	Lynxi	why don't you just clean install 10.10?
2011-01-15T04:36:00.000Z	Lynxi	KM0201	because i like 9.10.. I tried 10.10.
2011-01-15T04:36:00.000Z	KM0201	Lynxi	well, i liked WIndows 95 to, but when it's useful life expired, i knew i had to move on
2011-01-15T04:38:00.000Z	Lynxi	KM0201	Also, I didn't  enjoy 10.10 because I ha dthe same sound problems as I am having now, exxept there was no sound what so ever
