2005-11-20T07:49:00.000Z	StDellis		Is linux very limited on what printers work for it? I want to install a dell printer but its not listed and I cant find the driver?
2005-11-20T07:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	StDellis	 check the cups.org site and see what they say about the printer.
2005-11-20T07:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	StDellis	 also a 'dell' printer is proberly just some other comanies printer with a dell logo on it.
2005-11-20T07:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	StDellis	 google is your friend. :P
2005-11-20T07:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	StDellis	 could check the output of 'dmesg' when you plug the printer in also.
2005-11-20T07:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	StDellis	 check the CUPS homepage and see what they say about it. Ubuntu  uses the CUPS printing system
2005-11-20T07:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	StDellis	 'with CUPS' - Linux has nothing todo with it. :P
2005-11-20T07:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	StDellis	 and its possible its a clone of some other printer that does work.. try googleing for that 'printer make and linux'
2005-11-20T07:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	StDellis	 CUPS is the default ubuntu printing software - its allready there.
2005-11-20T08:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	StDellis	 first hit on google says --->  The Dell 720 can be used with the Lexmark Z615 printer driver
2005-11-20T08:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	StDellis	 use 'sudo' not 'su -'    -- Its a Ubuntu "feature" for more security
2005-11-20T08:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	StDellis	 no clue - never used alien.      you may need to do 'sudo alien whatever.rpm'
2005-11-20T09:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	StDellis	 cuop's web interface is disabled i think by default. you have to use the gnome cups tool.
2005-11-20T09:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	StDellis	 if you got the driver isntalled - you may need to restart the cups service
2005-11-20T09:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	StDellis	 thats the place.
2005-11-22T10:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	StDellis	 you need some SNES roms.
2005-11-22T10:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	StDellis	 perhaps. never noticed. :P  just select file, in the menus and load the roms.
2005-11-22T10:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	StDellis	 it may of come with a demo/pd rom or 2.
2005-11-24T11:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	StDellis	 care to give a little more details?
