2006-03-19T12:02:00.000Z	sybariten		i made a bin dir in my homedir ... whats the best place to implement that it should be in the path every time i log in over SSH ?
2006-03-19T12:03:00.000Z	sybariten		or, in other words: i have some scripts etc that i want to use without supplying the whole path. How do i make sure

2006-03-19T12:03:00.000Z	_jason	sybariten	look at ~/.bash_profile, I *think* that gets sourced when you login over ssh.  If not, just put it in ~/.bashrc
2006-03-19T12:04:00.000Z	sybariten	_jason	thank you!
2006-03-19T12:12:00.000Z	_jason	sybariten	it's commented though
2006-03-19T12:12:00.000Z	_jason	sybariten	at least I think it is
2006-03-19T12:12:00.000Z	sybariten	_jason	no, it wasnt, i probably removed that comment if there was one ... in other words, i had already fixed what i came here asking about
2006-03-19T12:12:00.000Z	_jason	sybariten	ah so it works then?
2006-03-19T12:13:00.000Z	sybariten	_jason	yes, it worked all the time, forgot to check     *blush*
2006-04-29T07:10:00.000Z	sybariten	_jason	thank you
2006-04-29T07:10:00.000Z	_jason	sybariten	erm, do you have X?
2006-04-29T07:10:00.000Z	sybariten	_jason	no, why ?
2006-04-29T07:11:00.000Z	_jason	sybariten	well, can you read the link ubotu provided ok?
2006-04-29T07:12:00.000Z	sybariten	_jason	hey i've got computers high and low. I'm doing IRC from an XP computer for instance, so thats not a problem
2006-04-29T07:12:00.000Z	_jason	sybariten	ok good, in case the wiki doesn't discuss how to do it with synaptic, just read the comments in /etc/apt/sources.list or you can just use the official sources ubotu provided for breezy (those give you multiverse which the comments don't include afaik)
2006-04-29T07:15:00.000Z	sybariten	_jason	ok thanks! (repositories issues are so damn confusing ... why not just add as many servers as possible from the beginning?)
2006-05-17T16:11:00.000Z	_jason	sybariten	yes i believe so
