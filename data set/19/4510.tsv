2009-01-02T04:15:00.000Z	ikonia	mib_idz5t157	the window shuts once the script is run
2009-01-02T04:15:00.000Z	ikonia	mib_idz5t157	so fast you can't see
2009-01-02T04:15:00.000Z	ikonia	mib_idz5t157	keep in mind, a shell is not a terminal
2009-01-02T04:15:00.000Z	ikonia	mib_idz5t157	you can launch a bash shell without a visual window
2009-01-02T04:18:00.000Z	mib_idz5t157	ikonia	but when I run the same script from the terminal, it does not return until i ctrl+c, how come the script returns when run from the desktop
2009-01-02T04:18:00.000Z	mib_idz5t157	ikonia	sorry if i am a little confused
2009-01-02T04:19:00.000Z	ikonia	mib_idz5t157	as I said unless your launching a terminal THEN launching a script you won't see the shell open
2009-01-02T04:19:00.000Z	ikonia	mib_idz5t157	your launching a shell behind the desktop,
2009-01-02T04:19:00.000Z	ikonia	mib_idz5t157	you need a terminal to see a shell
2009-01-02T04:19:00.000Z	ikonia	mib_idz5t157	does that make sense ?
2009-01-02T04:19:00.000Z	mib_idz5t157	ikonia	right
2009-01-02T04:20:00.000Z	mib_idz5t157	ikonia	it's just it works differently on say osx
2009-01-02T04:20:00.000Z	ikonia	mib_idz5t157	possible
2009-01-02T04:22:00.000Z	mib_idz5t157	ikonia	what would be the command to run the script in a terminal window? The current desktop shortcut goes something like "/bin/sh my/script.sh"
2009-01-02T04:22:00.000Z	ikonia	mib_idz5t157	something like xterm -c "/bin/bash my/script.sh"
2009-01-02T04:23:00.000Z	mib_idz5t157	ikonia	can I expect xterm command to be available and on the path for all ubuntus (this is for an installer)
2009-01-02T04:24:00.000Z	ikonia	mib_idz5t157	use gnome-terminal if you want
2009-01-02T04:24:00.000Z	mib_idz5t157	ikonia	ok, thanks a lot
