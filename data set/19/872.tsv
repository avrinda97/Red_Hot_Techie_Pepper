2011-08-02T01:29:00.000Z	Hot2Trot	w3bcrawler	is your problem involving samba? I may actually be able to help you, but I came in too late to see your question
2011-08-02T01:31:00.000Z	Hot2Trot	w3bcrawler	i'm not so hot at windows 7... but do you think your problem is configuration maybe?
2011-08-02T01:31:00.000Z	Hot2Trot	w3bcrawler	ie smb.conf
2011-08-02T01:31:00.000Z	Hot2Trot	w3bcrawler	therin lies all problems
2011-08-02T01:32:00.000Z	Hot2Trot	w3bcrawler	are you logging in with an admin user? Should try that first make sure there aren't weird permissions things going on.  Check the permissions on the files you are sharing on samba
2011-08-02T01:34:00.000Z	Hot2Trot	w3bcrawler	you have smb.conf setup correctly?
2011-08-02T01:36:00.000Z	Hot2Trot	w3bcrawler	let me get this straight, your end goal is to just get files off your windows 7 machine and ONTO an ubuntu mahine?
2011-08-02T01:37:00.000Z	Hot2Trot	w3bcrawler	winscp will resume if something happens for any reason
2011-08-02T01:38:00.000Z	Hot2Trot	w3bcrawler	1. go to ubuntu machine and do sudo apt-get install ssh 2. go to windows machine and download and install winscp
2011-08-02T01:40:00.000Z	Hot2Trot	w3bcrawler	type this exactly in a prompt without the quotes "sudo apt-get install ssh"
2011-08-02T01:45:00.000Z	Hot2Trot	w3bcrawler	yes, something along the lines of 192.168.1.*** usually
2011-08-02T01:46:00.000Z	Hot2Trot	w3bcrawler	yes, put that ip in your hostname and same username/password you use to login to the computer
2011-08-02T01:47:00.000Z	Hot2Trot	w3bcrawler	the server should already be going after you installed it
2011-08-02T01:49:00.000Z	w3bcrawler	Hot2Trot	+10 Internets to you, sir.
2011-08-02T01:49:00.000Z	Hot2Trot	w3bcrawler	thanks, let's hope the karma passes along
