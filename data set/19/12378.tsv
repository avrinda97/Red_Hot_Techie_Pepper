2011-06-11T06:44:00.000Z	Darkenvy		How do I add a user to the sudoer file while in vim?
2011-06-11T06:44:00.000Z	Darkenvy		as in where do I put the name?
2011-06-11T06:44:00.000Z	Flannel	Darkenvy	What are you hoping to accomplish by adding the user to sudoers?
2011-06-11T06:45:00.000Z	Flannel	Darkenvy	Yeah, it does, because if you're just trying to give a user the ability to sudo, you don't modify sudoers.
2011-06-11T06:46:00.000Z	Flannel	Darkenvy	They were mistaken, you instead want to add the user that you want to allow to sudo to the admin group.
2011-06-11T06:46:00.000Z	Flannel	Darkenvy	sudo adduser username admin (where "username" is the user you want to give the ability to sudo to)
2011-06-11T06:47:00.000Z	Flannel	Darkenvy	alright, well, try sudo adduser admin admin
2011-06-11T06:47:00.000Z	Flannel	Darkenvy	Are you currently logged in as admin?
2011-06-11T06:48:00.000Z	Flannel	Darkenvy	can you please pastebin the output of 'id admin'?
2011-06-11T06:48:00.000Z	Flannel	Darkenvy	Are you using Ubuntu?
2011-06-11T06:49:00.000Z	Flannel	Darkenvy	You want #debian then.
2011-06-11T06:49:00.000Z	Flannel	Darkenvy	This is set up entirely different than Ubuntu, you don't already have an admin group, and your sudoers file is likely completely different as well.
2011-06-11T06:50:00.000Z	Flannel	Darkenvy	So really, you wouldn't be able to use the help that we would give you anyway.  Go ask in #debian, they can help you much more effectively than we can in this matter.
