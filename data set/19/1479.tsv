2012-04-04T16:26:00.000Z	Rienzilla		Hey guys, I'm trying to make a SIP-call with ubuntu empathy. The sip call seems to be doing fine (it connects, and my pbx passes and connects the call), but I hear absolutely nothing. Sound works fine on the machine otherwise. Any ideas what I might be dopin gwrong?
2012-04-04T16:27:00.000Z	schnuffle	Rienzilla	Any NAT between the 2 endpoints?
2012-04-04T16:28:00.000Z	Rienzilla	schnuffle	I just hear nothing, evennot the ring-tones
2012-04-04T16:29:00.000Z	schnuffle	Rienzilla	So you have a setup         your phone -> PBX -> other phone ( in the same network)?
2012-04-04T16:30:00.000Z	Rienzilla	schnuffle	yes
2012-04-04T16:30:00.000Z	schnuffle	Rienzilla	have you checked the logs of your PBX and eventually the logs of empathy?
2012-04-04T16:31:00.000Z	Rienzilla	schnuffle	the pbx seems to do fine (it receives the call, and starts playing a message)
2012-04-04T16:32:00.000Z	schnuffle	Rienzilla	 have you checked with another softphone? I left empathy beside as I don't like it and had some problems as well
2012-04-04T16:33:00.000Z	schnuffle	Rienzilla	Then do that before anything else
2012-04-04T16:35:00.000Z	Rienzilla	schnuffle	what would be a decent voip phone?
2012-04-04T16:37:00.000Z	schnuffle	Rienzilla	 linphone, twinkle
2012-04-04T16:38:00.000Z	schnuffle	Rienzilla	You were not adviced  you got the hint to test another softphone. That hint came as you mentioned everything with the PBX is alright
2012-04-04T16:41:00.000Z	schnuffle	Rienzilla	 Have you any pone connected to your PBX that works correctly?
2012-04-04T16:41:00.000Z	Rienzilla	schnuffle	yes
2012-04-04T16:42:00.000Z	schnuffle	Rienzilla	Hardware, Softphone, Linux,Windows?
2012-04-04T16:43:00.000Z	schnuffle	Rienzilla	Okay, then is your Box running a Firewall?
2012-04-04T16:44:00.000Z	schnuffle	Rienzilla	So my hint ( advice ) in the end was correct :)
2012-04-04T16:45:00.000Z	schnuffle	Rienzilla	I think empathy is a peace of crap, but that's jst my opinion
2012-04-04T16:46:00.000Z	schnuffle	Rienzilla	It could be due to having a mixture of pulse audio and alsa
