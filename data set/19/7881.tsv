2008-02-26T22:49:00.000Z	prasanna		this is weird, after doing an update just not i lost the ability to go wireless
2008-02-26T22:49:00.000Z	prasanna		i can only connect to the net through wired
2008-02-26T22:50:00.000Z	eljak	prasanna	try using wlassistant
2008-02-26T22:50:00.000Z	eljak		with it i can connect to wireless, parallel to my wired connection
2008-02-26T22:51:00.000Z	prasanna		wats that eljak?
2008-02-26T22:51:00.000Z	prasanna		i'm pretty new to all this, so sorry if that was a dumb question
2008-02-26T22:52:00.000Z	eljak	prasanna	a wireless connection manager
2008-02-26T22:52:00.000Z	prasanna		see, i dont even have that option anymore, i only see 'wired' and 'modem'
2008-02-26T22:52:00.000Z	eljak	prasanna	sudo apt-get install wlassitant and i guess to work fine you should run it with sudo
2008-02-26T22:53:00.000Z	prasanna		 Couldn't find package wlassitant
2008-02-26T22:54:00.000Z	eljak	prasanna	sorry forgot an "s" it is wlassistant

2008-02-26T22:55:00.000Z	prasanna		after its downloaded, anything else i need to do?
2008-02-26T22:55:00.000Z	prasanna		basically configure it?
2008-02-26T22:56:00.000Z	prasanna		just weird, i mean i do an update, and after reboot wifi has been removed. is that a common occurrence?
2008-02-26T22:57:00.000Z	eljak	prasanna	as i said maybe you will need to run it with sudo, and it should work fine other than that, check that you have your wireless card "on"
2008-02-26T22:58:00.000Z	prasanna		ya its downloading right nw, did need sudo. thanks again
2008-02-26T22:59:00.000Z	prasanna	eljak	its been downloaded and installed, what should i do now? reboot for things to take effect?
