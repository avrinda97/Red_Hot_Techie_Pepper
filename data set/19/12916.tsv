2006-01-04T09:08:00.000Z	rev	erUSUL	sata_sil and libata are loaded http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/6376
2006-01-04T09:10:00.000Z	erUSUL	rev	use /dev/dm/* if /dev/sd* are not aviable
2006-01-04T09:11:00.000Z	rev	erUSUL	I get 3 devices in /dev/dm ...that disk is unformatted...which one should I use? and why do I not get /dev/sd* ?
2006-01-04T09:12:00.000Z	erUSUL	rev	i do not know :(. You should get the /dev/sd* devices. do you see something in the dmesg?
2006-01-04T09:13:00.000Z	rev	erUSUL	only these lines http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/6376
2006-01-04T09:15:00.000Z	erUSUL	rev	i do not have sata myself so i can not know for sure. do you have any /dev/scsi0 or something?
2006-01-04T09:15:00.000Z	rev	erUSUL	nope nothing beside that dm thingy
2006-01-04T09:16:00.000Z	rev	erUSUL	and I cannot unload dm_mod ...it's in use
2006-01-04T09:17:00.000Z	erUSUL	rev	i do not know. sata support in linux is a little bit beta http://linuxmafia.com/faq/Hardware/sata.html
2006-01-04T09:19:00.000Z	rev	erUSUL	I think dm_mod is resposible for this but I dont know how to unload it... well thanks so far :)
