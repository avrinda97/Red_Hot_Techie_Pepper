2006-09-02T12:21:00.000Z	DigitalNinja		I've got an IPod Nano I would like to connect to my Ubuntu box
2006-09-02T12:21:00.000Z	DigitalNinja		It's in HFS+ format
2006-09-02T12:22:00.000Z	DigitalNinja		I'm not sure if I should format etc... or try to mount it read write using HFS+
2006-09-02T12:22:00.000Z	DigitalNinja		Well, I can mount the IPod and banshee can see it
2006-09-02T12:23:00.000Z	brendonjt	DigitalNinja	 ok  i didn't think much of basnshee  try gtkpod  it works wonders  and  works great with ipods
2006-09-02T12:23:00.000Z	DigitalNinja	brendonjt	banshee should work. I just need to mount the IPod read write
2006-09-02T12:24:00.000Z	brendonjt	DigitalNinja	 i couldn't do it with  my g4 ipod photo,  it kept crashing,  but i used  gtkpod and would never look back
2006-09-02T12:25:00.000Z	DigitalNinja	brendonjt	How do I mount the IPod read write? Or should I format it fat32?
2006-09-02T12:26:00.000Z	brendonjt	DigitalNinja	 the mac one hfs+ formated and the windows is fat32, with the ipod software on a windows machine will format it fat32
2006-09-02T12:27:00.000Z	brendonjt	DigitalNinja	 format it and use gtk pod,  rockbox  is power hungry  i found
2006-09-02T12:28:00.000Z	brendonjt	DigitalNinja	 rockbox is a simple linux replacment firmware on the ipod
2006-09-02T12:29:00.000Z	brendonjt	DigitalNinja	 nope  it recreates the files system and the likes
2006-09-02T13:17:00.000Z	brendonjt	DigitalNinja	 nope
2006-09-02T13:18:00.000Z	DigitalNinja	brendonjt	I see
2006-09-02T13:19:00.000Z	brendonjt	DigitalNinja	 yip  and ur battery  will be used in notime flat
2006-09-02T13:21:00.000Z	brendonjt	DigitalNinja	 cool and what linux app you going to use
2006-09-02T13:22:00.000Z	brendonjt	DigitalNinja	 make sure u use windows to do it and use the ipod updater  to do that
2006-09-02T13:23:00.000Z	DigitalNinja	brendonjt	I'm doing it all on Linux
2006-09-02T13:24:00.000Z	brendonjt	DigitalNinja	 um best to do it on a windoes machine as the software recreates the directory structure and the likes which is needed
