2007-12-01T21:40:00.000Z	graulich		I can't get my new creative webcam working. I'm on gutsy. what do I do?
2007-12-01T21:42:00.000Z	graulich		I just spent twenty euro on this cam ><
2007-12-01T21:42:00.000Z	tz80122	graulich	you should have checked if the webcams runs before buying it
2007-12-01T21:44:00.000Z	graulich		I looked around earlier and the first result I got was the wiki page about webcams which starts with "some webcams autodetect" so I mistakenly assumed if I get a mainstream brandname it'l just work
2007-12-01T21:45:00.000Z	tz80122	graulich	no. creative, just like any other manufacturer use all kind of chipsets in their webcams. and they keep changing those chipsets very fast.
2007-12-01T21:45:00.000Z	graulich		great. I'll have to see what the return policy is over there.
2007-12-01T21:47:00.000Z	tz80122	graulich	before returning it, google for the usb-id you get from lsusb
2007-12-01T21:47:00.000Z	graulich	tz80122	did already before
2007-12-01T21:47:00.000Z	tz80122	graulich	alright
2007-12-01T21:47:00.000Z	tz80122	graulich	i guess then you are out of luck with this one
2007-12-01T21:48:00.000Z	graulich	tz80122	looks like it. =\
2007-12-01T21:49:00.000Z	tz80122	graulich	just a suggestion. before buying a new one, try to download the windows driver for that new model and look at the usb-id in the driver's .inf file.
2007-12-01T21:49:00.000Z	tz80122	graulich	so you get an idea of the chipset in there
2007-12-01T21:49:00.000Z	graulich		I'm just gonna stick to the lists of supported webcams
2007-12-01T21:50:00.000Z	tz80122	graulich	note that there are revisions
2007-12-01T21:50:00.000Z	graulich		oh
2007-12-01T21:50:00.000Z	tz80122	graulich	even if the product name is the same, a newer revision can have a totally different chipset
2007-12-01T21:51:00.000Z	tz80122	graulich	that's why i suggest taking a look at the usb-id in the recent windows driver
2007-12-01T21:52:00.000Z	tz80122	graulich	some manufacturers print the revision number on the package. for example d-link does that for their wlan products.
