2010-02-26T20:59:00.000Z	sbts	phox_	there is a very good company here in Australia that does data recovery at very reasonable rates, they also take on work from all around the globe, give me a moment and I will find a link for you
2010-02-26T21:01:00.000Z	phox_	sbts	thx that would be great..
2010-02-26T21:01:00.000Z	sbts	phox_	and rifter: the url for the company is http://www.payam.com.au  I have personally spoken to the manager and have clients that have used them, all reports have been 5+ stars
2010-02-26T21:01:00.000Z	phox_	sbts	is that better then using photorec?
2010-02-26T21:03:00.000Z	sbts	phox_	you may have some luck with photorec, but make sure the drive is mounted readonly. once anything starts writing to the drive, your chances drop VERY rapidly.
2010-02-26T21:03:00.000Z	phox_	sbts	fuck, its been in normal mode all the time, and writing
2010-02-26T21:06:00.000Z	sbts	phox_	the drive that got formatted, is it the one that the system is now installed on, or is it a second drive
2010-02-26T21:07:00.000Z	phox_	sbts	its a laptop so i guess its only one disk, atleast thats all i find. Plus it says that the hd had bad sectors or something..
2010-02-26T21:10:00.000Z	sbts	phox_	if that is the case, you likely will have a hard job recovering old photos, but things that were saved more recently may be ok. can you please run "df -h" in a terminal and post the results for /dev/sdax where x is all numbers reported
2010-02-26T21:11:00.000Z	phox_	sbts	im not on that computer right now. Im not sure if i wanna start it and write even moore to it, mayby i should just leave it to some professionel.
2010-02-26T21:12:00.000Z	sbts	phox_	if you have a live CD around, boot from that, you shouldn't make it any worse atm.
2010-02-26T21:13:00.000Z	sbts	phox_	once you have booted from a live cd, let me know and I will help you mount it readonly, df needs the filesystem to be mounted :(
2010-02-26T21:14:00.000Z	phox_	sbts	well the weird thing is that when i tried to install ubuntu from the live cd it took ages to even get into the install-menu, and most of the times i tried it didnt even work. I think the disk might be broken.
2010-02-26T21:14:00.000Z	phox_	sbts	and as i said, ubuntu says it has bad sectors and stuff
2010-02-26T21:16:00.000Z	sbts	phox_	hm, I think you will be best passing it to the experts, and from what I have seen around the industry in recent times the link I gave you is one of the best. I believe they do a lot of work for very highlevel clients around the globe
2010-02-26T21:16:00.000Z	sbts	phox_	where abouts are you?
2010-02-26T21:18:00.000Z	phox_	sbts	i live in sweden.
2010-02-26T21:19:00.000Z	phox_	sbts	plus im a student so i cant afford it anyways i think. Ill probably leave to a friend of mine who is a pc-wiz. thx for the info anyways
2010-02-26T21:22:00.000Z	sbts	phox_	no problem, there are a couple of good linux tools that you can investigate, search aptitude for terms like "data recovery" and "forensic" (I think I spelled that right). to overcome the problems with booting the laptop from the live CD, I would remove the drive, and connect it to another machine, if it is a SATA drive this is a direct plugin, if it is an IDE drive you will need an adaptor. don't use a usb adaptor though as it will be co
