2011-06-20T07:29:00.000Z	Starminn		When I play something through the mic input on my system, if goes straight through to the computer's speakers, but Audacity, etc. don't pick anything up. Ubuntu 10.10 32-bit, any assitance would be appreciated. :)
2011-06-20T07:31:00.000Z	Wildinc	Starminn	What is your chipset? Intel?
2011-06-20T07:32:00.000Z	Starminn	Wildinc	I assume this would be under lspci -- but which option under that output is it?

2011-06-20T07:35:00.000Z	Starminn	Wildinc	Care to elaborate on what exactly I'm looking for on that page?
2011-06-20T07:40:00.000Z	Wildinc	Starminn	try and change the setting using HDA Analyzer
2011-06-20T07:47:00.000Z	Starminn	Wildinc	/proc/asound/card0/codec* does not exist on my system apparently
2011-06-20T07:49:00.000Z	Wildinc	Starminn	pastebin the output of lspci -nv

2011-06-20T07:52:00.000Z	Wildinc	Starminn	cant see the soundcard from that output. Please run arecord -l
2011-06-20T07:53:00.000Z	Starminn	Wildinc	If I understand correctly, the sound card should just be: 03:03.0 Multimedia audio controller: Creative Labs SB X-Fi

2011-06-20T07:58:00.000Z	Starminn	Wildinc	"As of Ubuntu 8.10 (Intrepid Ibex) and 9.04 (Jaunty Jackalope) they work fine" is this "...work fine [by default]" or "...work fine [after doing these steps]?"
2011-06-20T07:59:00.000Z	Wildinc	Starminn	There not working at the moment right? So i would try those steps just in case you have nothing to lose
2011-06-20T08:00:00.000Z	Starminn	Wildinc	Well, all the sound works fine -- the only thing that doesn't work is recording from mic input.
2011-06-20T08:01:00.000Z	Wildinc	Starminn	I have had the same issue but i was using an Intel sound card and the fix was to play with settings in the HDA Anyaliser. As for creative sound cards i have no clue.... Sorry
2011-06-20T08:02:00.000Z	Starminn	Wildinc	Well, if you had this same issue and similar steps solved it, then it's certainly worth the time playing around with it. :) Thanks
2011-06-20T08:03:00.000Z	Wildinc	Starminn	Yea finally got it working, I wish you luck
