2012-03-22T12:59:00.000Z	ejv	ohs	that's better, but i don't see anything besides your optical drives and primary disk
2012-03-22T12:59:00.000Z	ejv	ohs	this makes me wonder if your kernel doesn't have the proper support for this kingston SD card
2012-03-22T13:02:00.000Z	ohs	ejv	I get the SD card with a TI product, normally it should be working fine I guess I never seen any notice about it. this is the printscreen of my wmware http://i42.tinypic.com/2h6c36s.jpg
2012-03-22T13:03:00.000Z	ejv	ohs	this might sound... archaic, but why not use filezilla or any other SFTP client, and copy your files INTO your VM?
2012-03-22T13:07:00.000Z	ohs	ejv	MestreLion: thank you very very much for your help and time, I will download virtual box
2012-03-22T13:08:00.000Z	ejv	ohs	i've used vbox on both windows and ubuntu hosts, works great, and it's free-er than vmware
