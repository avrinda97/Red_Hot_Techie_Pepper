2008-04-05T22:38:00.000Z	christophoros		guys anyone care to tell me how i check for restricted drivers?
2008-04-05T22:40:00.000Z	nickrud	christophoros	which one?
2008-04-05T22:40:00.000Z	christophoros	nickrud	for grafic card
2008-04-05T22:41:00.000Z	nickrud	christophoros	which video card?    lspci | grep -i vga    in a terminal will tell you exactly
2008-04-05T22:41:00.000Z	christophoros	nickrud	00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation Mobile 945GM/GMS, 943/940GML Express Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 03)
2008-04-05T22:42:00.000Z	nickrud	christophoros	that chip doesn't have a restricted driver, the one that comes native with ubuntu is the best available
2008-04-05T22:42:00.000Z	christophoros	nickrud	so why i cant enable the visual effects?
2008-04-05T22:43:00.000Z	nickrud	christophoros	because it has a bug, and is blacklisted. See http://wiki.compiz-fusion.org/Hardware/Blacklist for the reason, and a way to override the blacklisting
2008-04-05T22:46:00.000Z	christophoros	nickrud	how i can use this command in terminal? "SKIP_CHECKS=yes compiz-manager"
2008-04-05T22:46:00.000Z	nickrud	christophoros	 type it directly in the terminal, without the   "  .
2008-04-05T22:49:00.000Z	christophoros	nickrud	i done what the page says but it doesnt seem i can enable my grafics now:/
2008-04-05T22:49:00.000Z	nickrud	christophoros	if that command worked, you'd have the effects running immediately. I've seen some 965's work, and others not. Don't know why.
2008-04-05T22:50:00.000Z	christophoros	nickrud	so i cant use any effects now ?
2008-04-05T22:51:00.000Z	nickrud	christophoros	maybe when hardy comes out, you should ask for info about it in #ubuntu+1 (only a couple weeks away)
2008-04-05T22:51:00.000Z	nickrud	christophoros	I meant ask for info in #ubuntu+1 now, that is. That sentence didn't quite say that :)
2008-04-05T22:51:00.000Z	christophoros	nickrud	when i do that command i get some error too
2008-04-05T22:51:00.000Z	nickrud	christophoros	put the error on http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org
2008-04-05T22:52:00.000Z	nickrud	christophoros	saw it
2008-04-05T22:52:00.000Z	nickrud	christophoros	you can get more info on #compiz-fusion as well
