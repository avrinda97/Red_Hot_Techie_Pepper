2006-04-20T07:18:00.000Z	tRSS		quick question: i have curl, wget, sed installated and using pipes, i want to be able to download pdf files from a few sites. these sites have documentations (as pdfs) of our company. instead of downloading each and every document individually, i just want to harness the power of linux to make my work easier, so need some help from you folks!
2006-04-20T07:18:00.000Z	tRSS		how can I do it?
2006-04-20T07:19:00.000Z	slavik	tRSS	use perl :)
2006-04-20T07:19:00.000Z	tRSS	slavik	don't know perl that well! :(
2006-04-20T07:20:00.000Z	slavik	tRSS	the site is html?
2006-04-20T07:20:00.000Z	tRSS	slavik	it is html
2006-04-20T07:21:00.000Z	tRSS	slavik	to be exact, it htm
2006-04-20T07:21:00.000Z	slavik	tRSS	once you load a file into a variable: open $in, "index.html |" or die$!;
2006-04-20T07:22:00.000Z	tRSS	slavik	you lost me there :'(
2006-04-20T07:22:00.000Z	tRSS	slavik	hold on, don't tell me yet, let me try again on my own and see if I can do it
2006-04-20T07:23:00.000Z	tRSS	slavik	if i can't, i know whom to look for! :)
2006-04-20T07:23:00.000Z	slavik	tRSS	the pdfs are all on the same html page?
2006-04-20T07:23:00.000Z	slavik	tRSS	what company is this btw? (your company)
2006-04-20T07:23:00.000Z	tRSS	slavik	yes sir
2006-04-20T07:25:00.000Z	tRSS	slavik	i thought curl can download the htm content of the webpage, and I can somehow parse it to extract the pdf links, doing a stdout to wget, using pipes somehow. I understand what to do, just don't know how to do it
2006-04-20T07:36:00.000Z	slavik	tRSS	did that command for wget work for you?
2006-04-20T07:38:00.000Z	tRSS	slavik	the command is working beautifully
2006-04-20T07:39:00.000Z	tRSS	slavik	& mauper: may be it is time for me to learn to use the bigger weapons, such as perl :)
2006-04-20T08:04:00.000Z	tRSS	slavik	/ mauper: quick question: i want to disable and then enable eth0 of a remote machine. to disable and enable it, i would use ifconfig eth0 down (and up) but, once eth0 goes down, i will also lose connection. how can I disable/enable eth0, such that i am not disconnected. or even if I am disconnected, eth0 is back up
