2009-02-27T01:56:00.000Z	ToKico	obi	what model is your wireless card?
2009-02-27T01:57:00.000Z	obi	ToKico	atheros 5007 i think, i have the proper driver i believe, so thats not the issue, its installing the driver.
2009-02-27T01:57:00.000Z	ToKico	obi	you're trying to use ndiswrapper? or it is a native linux driver and trying to compile it?
2009-02-27T01:58:00.000Z	obi	ToKico	its madwifi driver
2009-02-27T01:59:00.000Z	ToKico	obi	yes, it is native. try this: http://linux-wireless.org/Install-HOWTO/Drivers/madwifi/0.Howto.Install.Madwifi.txt
2009-02-27T01:59:00.000Z	ToKico	obi	I don't have a wireless card, so I can't try anything...
2009-02-27T02:03:00.000Z	ToKico	obi	have you tried it?
2009-02-27T02:03:00.000Z	obi	ToKico	no i dont think that works for the particular driver i have. i think i jsut need to learn how to build from the .tar file
2009-02-27T02:05:00.000Z	ToKico	obi	it should be how any "normal" package compiles: extract the tar, and inside of the folder containing the extracted file, run "./configure", then "make" and then "sudo make install". That should install it.
2009-02-27T02:13:00.000Z	ToKico	obi	because you have to change into the extracted files. imagine that the files extracted to a certain "madwifi-obi" folder. you have to type "cd madwifi-obi" to change into that directory.
2009-02-27T02:14:00.000Z	obi	ToKico	oh so the individual files. there are a ton of files, need i do this to all of them?
2009-02-27T02:14:00.000Z	obi	ToKico	or jsut the make files?
2009-02-27T02:15:00.000Z	ToKico	obi	no. i'm going to guide you step by step. delete all the files extracted. tell when done.
2009-02-27T02:15:00.000Z	ToKico	obi	it's just more simple :D
2009-02-27T02:16:00.000Z	obi	ToKico	ok
2009-02-27T02:16:00.000Z	obi	ToKico	do you mind PMing me?
2009-02-27T02:16:00.000Z	ToKico	obi	ok.
2009-02-27T02:18:00.000Z	obi	ToKico	done, all deleted
