2007-02-06T15:29:00.000Z	towlieban		im using xchat-gnome. is there a way to connect to more than 1 server at a time ?
2007-02-06T15:30:00.000Z	haxality_	towlieban	ctrl-t IIRC
2007-02-06T15:30:00.000Z	towlieban	haxality_	i tried that and nothing happened
2007-02-06T15:30:00.000Z	haxality_	towlieban	is there an option for 'open new server tab' anywhere in the menu on the top of the screen?
2007-02-06T15:31:00.000Z	haxality_	towlieban	if you hold for like 2 minutes I'll install it and find it
2007-02-06T15:31:00.000Z	towlieban	haxality_	 ok
2007-02-06T15:33:00.000Z	haxality_	towlieban	hit ctrl-n
2007-02-06T15:34:00.000Z	towlieban	haxality_	ahh i see it automatically opens a new server tab
2007-02-06T15:34:00.000Z	towlieban	haxality_	in the past you had a choice
2007-02-06T15:35:00.000Z	towlieban	haxality_	you could connect to a server in the existing tab or open a new server tab and connect to the server in there
2007-02-06T15:35:00.000Z	haxality_	towlieban	yeah, I used xchat for a looong time
2007-02-06T15:36:00.000Z	towlieban	haxality_	actually ive used linux for a long time but am switching to os x
2007-02-06T15:36:00.000Z	haxality_	towlieban	if I had a mac I would use OSX probably :P
2007-02-06T15:36:00.000Z	towlieban	haxality_	 i dont have a mac but im using os x ;)
2007-02-06T15:37:00.000Z	haxality_	towlieban	heh, I would, except none of my hardware is supported by osx86
2007-02-06T15:37:00.000Z	towlieban	haxality_	im using osx86 on my gateway laptop....
2007-02-06T15:37:00.000Z	towlieban	haxality_	how old is it ?
2007-02-06T15:37:00.000Z	haxality_	towlieban	3 or so years, but it has a weird video card
2007-02-06T15:37:00.000Z	towlieban	haxality_	 i just bought my comp not too long ago. i want to sell it though so i can buy a macbook pro
