2005-07-13T12:06:00.000Z	rabies	Franklinux	got anything else?
2005-07-13T12:06:00.000Z	rabies	Franklinux	well then you are missing a few critical things, such as a cdrom drive
2005-07-13T12:07:00.000Z	rabies	Franklinux	i would go and get a processor, case, maybe a few fans, powersupply, etc
2005-07-13T12:08:00.000Z	rabies	Franklinux	ohh, ok
2005-07-13T12:08:00.000Z	rabies	Franklinux	that makes more sense then
2005-07-13T12:09:00.000Z	rabies	Franklinux	more detail = better
2005-07-13T12:09:00.000Z	rabies	Franklinux	hard to fix a problem with what you are telling us
2005-07-13T12:12:00.000Z	rabies	Franklinux	give us your COMPLETE system specifications
2005-07-13T12:12:00.000Z	rabies	Franklinux	i want to know the material of the case
2005-07-13T12:12:00.000Z	rabies	Franklinux	with what you are telling us we couldnt figure out if its the videocard or the fact that the computer isnt plugged in
2005-07-13T12:13:00.000Z	rabies	Franklinux	thats a step in the right direction
2005-07-13T12:13:00.000Z	rabies	Franklinux	now the CPU temp while running?
2005-07-13T12:15:00.000Z	rabies	Franklinux	you seem to know a lot for someone who doesnt give any info..
2005-07-13T12:16:00.000Z	rabies	Franklinux	look, you have hardware you arent talking about, you have steps leading up to that black screen
2005-07-13T12:17:00.000Z	rabies	Franklinux	its like me saying "I HAVE A COMPUTER" and expecting everyone to know how to take it apart and put it back together again without knowing what components are there and what they are
2005-07-13T12:17:00.000Z	rabies	Franklinux	what happens before the blank screen, and right after?
2005-07-13T12:17:00.000Z	rabies	Franklinux	any noises? tell tale signs of an issue?
2005-07-13T12:17:00.000Z	rabies	Franklinux	is it black or some other color?
