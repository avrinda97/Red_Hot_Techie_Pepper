2009-03-15T06:49:00.000Z	blahblah1lah		i've installed flash player (with no error messages). restarted firefox and still, youtube tells me that i still don't have it installed (FireFox). Now what? solution?
2009-03-15T06:50:00.000Z	sprinkmeier	blahblah1lah	are you running add-ons like flashblock?
2009-03-15T06:50:00.000Z	blahblah1lah	sprinkmeier	not to my knowledge. if it's not a default in firefox then no
2009-03-15T06:51:00.000Z	sprinkmeier	blahblah1lah	can you try a different size (like the adobe test-flash site) to confirm/deny that flash is working?
2009-03-15T06:52:00.000Z	sprinkmeier	blahblah1lah	http://www.adobe.com/shockwave/welcome/ should do it
2009-03-15T06:54:00.000Z	sprinkmeier	blahblah1lah	if adobe can't find flash then youtube won't either.... check FF options to make sure flash is enabled?
2009-03-15T06:55:00.000Z	blahblah1lah	sprinkmeier	alright, let me look once more at that..
2009-03-15T06:55:00.000Z	blahblah1lah	sprinkmeier	it doesn't make sense to me though that i'd have installed flash player and that it wouldn't be enabled
2009-03-15T06:56:00.000Z	blahblah1lah	sprinkmeier	which menu should i check at?
2009-03-15T06:57:00.000Z	sprinkmeier	blahblah1lah	edit->prefs->security? (not running FF at the moment, going from memory...)
2009-03-15T06:59:00.000Z	blahblah1lah	sprinkmeier	there's no setting that would indicate it would be disabled.
2009-03-15T06:59:00.000Z	blahblah1lah	sprinkmeier	Adobe Flash player, that is
2009-03-15T07:01:00.000Z	sprinkmeier	blahblah1lah	did you install flash as root (i.e. is it available for everyone?) does it work from another account? Are you going through some sort of proxy/.firewall/filter that might be disabling flash?
2009-03-15T07:03:00.000Z	sprinkmeier	blahblah1lah	try the gust login (8.10 right?) to see if it's just something to do with your account. FF-Flash should work out of the box...
2009-03-15T07:04:00.000Z	blahblah1lah	sprinkmeier	this is the main administrative account. no reason why it shouldn't work in this account, of all accounts, heh.
2009-03-15T07:04:00.000Z	blahblah1lah	sprinkmeier	as for the version, let me double check
2009-03-15T07:06:00.000Z	sprinkmeier	blahblah1lah	the 'main admin' account is just art of the admin group, which allows sudo to run and configure things. otherwise it's the same as a 'normal' account. I'd suggest switching users just in case something is messed up in your settings (maybe old pages are cached, maybe there's an add-on you, whatever).  8.04 does not have a guest login by default so you might have to create a junk account to test this.
2009-03-15T07:07:00.000Z	blahblah1lah	sprinkmeier	 okay. i'll try it for the hell of it
2009-03-15T07:18:00.000Z	blahblah1lah	sprinkmeier	it doesn't even work under another user account. heh, some as-is package :P
