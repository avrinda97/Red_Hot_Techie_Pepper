2009-04-26T15:30:00.000Z	ideasman_42		Hi there, Im a blender3d developer and we often get reports about building on Ubuntu because by default there is no libGL.so
2009-04-26T15:30:00.000Z	ideasman_42		libGL.so.1 exists but not libGL.so
2009-04-26T15:31:00.000Z	ideasman_42		Ofcourse you can manually simlink but this isnt great
2009-04-26T15:31:00.000Z	user___	ideasman_42	+1
2009-04-26T15:31:00.000Z	ideasman_42		Is there some way we can support it?
2009-04-26T15:32:00.000Z	ideasman_42		eg build with -lGL.1
2009-04-26T15:32:00.000Z	ideasman_42		Blender3d we have a lot of users that build there own but are not devs
2009-04-26T15:32:00.000Z	user___	ideasman_42	how about joining ubuntu packagers or pointing users to your own repo  so theres no need for users to build blender
2009-04-26T15:33:00.000Z	ideasman_42		user__, no users should build :)
2009-04-26T15:33:00.000Z	ideasman_42	user___	we have a lot of technical users that build daily
2009-04-26T15:33:00.000Z	user___	ideasman_42	they can symlink :-)
2009-04-26T15:33:00.000Z	ideasman_42		sure they can, but if there was some solution Id like to fix it
2009-04-26T15:34:00.000Z	ideasman_42		so there is no way to link to libGL.so.1?
2009-04-26T15:34:00.000Z	user___	ideasman_42	you might submit a patch, state your background, and packagers might be well happy to include it
2009-04-26T15:35:00.000Z	ideasman_42		user__, would this patch make the symlink?
2009-04-26T15:35:00.000Z	user___	ideasman_42	yes, in the deb build process i guess
2009-04-26T15:36:00.000Z	ideasman_42		user__, hrm, will bug report instead, I mostly use arch, only ubuntu on every other system
2009-04-26T15:37:00.000Z	user___	ideasman_42	you just need to do the ln in $blender-source-deb/debian/postinst/. this gives ubuntu motu a start, they can discuss then anyway
2009-04-26T15:38:00.000Z	ideasman_42	user___	yep, but personally not interested in packaging
