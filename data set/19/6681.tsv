2008-10-05T13:05:00.000Z	Aron		I have bought a nvidia 8500GT graphic card,but how can I get it work?
2008-10-05T13:06:00.000Z	Aron		using that one,I cannot use compiz
2008-10-05T13:06:00.000Z	Aron		only a simple look
2008-10-05T13:08:00.000Z	Buyydee	Aron	install envy, start it from the main menu under 'system' and install the nvidia proprietary drivers. Then install nvidia-settings and start it with 'sudo nvidia-settings' from the terminal, make all changes, save them to the xorg.conf file by clicking the button there and things should be set up. Also think about having a look at the ubuntu wiki
2008-10-05T13:10:00.000Z	Aron	Buyydee	You do not appear to be using the NVIDIA X driver. Please edit your X configuration file (just run `nvidia-xconfig` as root), and restart the X server.
2008-10-05T13:10:00.000Z	Buyydee	Aron	did you install the driver using envy?
2008-10-05T13:10:00.000Z	Aron		yes
2008-10-05T13:11:00.000Z	Buyydee		restarted x-server?
2008-10-05T13:11:00.000Z	Aron		yes
2008-10-05T13:11:00.000Z	Aron		but only installed without do anything else
2008-10-05T13:12:00.000Z	Buyydee	Aron	without anything else means you installed envy, said install and then it should have asked you, if you want it to configure the drivers, did you do that?
2008-10-05T13:13:00.000Z	Aron		I use envy ,installed the drivers for nvdia
2008-10-05T13:13:00.000Z	Aron		nvidia
2008-10-05T13:14:00.000Z	Buyydee	Aron	at what point did you get the error message you posted?
2008-10-05T13:15:00.000Z	Aron		while I attemp to use some visual effects
2008-10-05T13:16:00.000Z	Buyydee	Aron	you'd help me a lot if you'd be more specific with your answers
2008-10-05T13:17:00.000Z	Buyydee	Aron	did envy aks you to configure the drivers for you?
2008-10-05T13:17:00.000Z	Aron		no
2008-10-05T13:18:00.000Z	Buyydee	Aron	try 'sudo nvidia-xconfig' and restart with ctrl+alt+backspace
