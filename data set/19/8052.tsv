2007-06-15T13:27:00.000Z	Lacrymology		ok
2007-06-15T13:27:00.000Z	Lacrymology		that's good
2007-06-15T13:27:00.000Z	Lacrymology		from there you can do what you were told
2007-06-15T13:27:00.000Z	Lacrymology		which I don't remember, sorry
2007-06-15T13:28:00.000Z	Lacrymology		yes.. something about somethingsomething xorg-config
2007-06-15T13:28:00.000Z	Lacrymology		that one
2007-06-15T13:28:00.000Z	Lacrymology		I'm new to debian distros
2007-06-15T13:28:00.000Z	erUSUL	Lacrymology	try 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg'
2008-05-06T20:42:00.000Z	erUSUL	Lacrymology	nope
2008-05-06T20:43:00.000Z	Lacrymology	erUSUL	what about adding debian's repos to my sources?
2008-05-06T20:43:00.000Z	erUSUL	Lacrymology	bad idea
2008-05-06T20:45:00.000Z	Lacrymology	erUSUL	I thought as much. I still need the newer package, and I don't have the 2+ days updating to HH takes (until having a stable machine for development)
2008-05-06T20:45:00.000Z	erUSUL	Lacrymology	you can try to enable backports and hope there is a new version there or in getdeb
2008-05-06T20:45:00.000Z	erUSUL	Lacrymology	which program do you want to upgrade?
2008-05-06T20:46:00.000Z	Lacrymology	erUSUL	libc
2008-05-06T20:46:00.000Z	Lacrymology	erUSUL	GG's version is ancient
2008-05-06T20:47:00.000Z	erUSUL	Lacrymology	pretty core package (second to the kernel but more risky to change) upgrading it may be risky ...
2008-05-06T20:50:00.000Z	erUSUL	Lacrymology	you know every (or close to) package on the system ends up depending on it if there is some issue you may end up with a useless system ...
2008-05-06T22:19:00.000Z	Lacrymology	erUSUL	it's been a long time, but it's been updated in HH, and it being lts I expect it to be ok
