2008-11-18T02:11:00.000Z	herrmess		Does anyone here uses Banshee? (media app)
2008-11-18T02:13:00.000Z	apeiron	herrmess	No Jamendo support == serious loss, for me.
2008-11-18T02:15:00.000Z	herrmess	apeiron	Really? What player supports Jamendo?
2008-11-18T02:15:00.000Z	apeiron	herrmess	rhythmbox
2008-11-18T02:15:00.000Z	apeiron	herrmess	How I learned about it, in fact.
2008-11-18T02:15:00.000Z	herrmess	apeiron	I just spent the last 2 days checking out music apps to replace Rhythmbox.
2008-11-18T02:16:00.000Z	apeiron	herrmess	Why trying to replace it?
2008-11-18T02:18:00.000Z	herrmess	apeiron	Something about the interface bugged me. I wanted a filesystem-view and pidgin "Now Playing".... hmm come to think of it the pidgin angle is covered by a musictracker plugin.
2008-11-18T02:18:00.000Z	apeiron	herrmess	ah.
2008-11-18T02:19:00.000Z	apeiron	herrmess	Migrating from OS X here, actually, was searching for an iTunes clone. :)
2008-11-18T02:19:00.000Z	herrmess	apeiron	Exaile looked like a worthy candidate, until I found out it simply cannot "JUST PLAY" a file on click.
2008-11-18T02:19:00.000Z	apeiron	herrmess	no me gusta
2008-11-18T02:20:00.000Z	herrmess	apeiron	Did you try Songbird ? It looks like iTunes AFAIK.
2008-11-18T02:20:00.000Z	herrmess	apeiron	(although it's still beta quality)
2008-11-18T02:20:00.000Z	apeiron	herrmess	Way, way, *way* too heavy.
2008-11-18T02:20:00.000Z	apeiron	herrmess	I don't want another XUL app running.
2008-11-18T02:20:00.000Z	herrmess	apeiron	Yeah, I can relate to that. Took it forever to index 10k files.
2008-11-18T02:21:00.000Z	apeiron	herrmess	I do appreciate its format support, though.
2008-11-18T02:21:00.000Z	herrmess	apeiron	I'll give Rhythmbox a second chance... will look into plugins.
