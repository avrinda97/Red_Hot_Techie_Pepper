2005-12-06T15:10:00.000Z	bunnynhb		Could someone build a kde compressed file so I could get just one file instead of many small ones at 56k.
2005-12-06T15:11:00.000Z	anavim	bunnynhb	the files coming from synaptic are compressed already
2005-12-06T15:13:00.000Z	bunnynhb	anavim	I'm having problems finding out what all I need and at 56k withmany files it get's tedious.  I need justone file.
2005-12-06T15:14:00.000Z	anavim	bunnynhb	if there are lots of dependencies needed to install, you won't be able to skip them
2005-12-06T15:15:00.000Z	bunnynhb	anavim	I was just hoping someone could put all of them into one easy downloadable fiole.

2005-12-06T15:17:00.000Z	bunnynhb	anavim	I aamdownloading in microsoft OS and amattempting to get Linux on the net to use apt-get.
2005-12-06T15:17:00.000Z	anavim	bunnynhb	your best best, imho, is to leave it overnight while it downloads and installs.. I've had to do similar things downloading oracle 9i (300MB) over 56k modem  :D

2005-12-06T15:28:00.000Z	bunnynhb	anavim	If Ubuntu shows my modem installed, is it really installed?  I've had problems with other linux OSs.
2005-12-06T15:29:00.000Z	anavim	bunnynhb	I haven't used a modem on ubuntu, sorry
