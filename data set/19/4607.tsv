2009-04-10T07:22:00.000Z	eseven73		I got my sounds working by doing this, set everything in sound options to ALSA, then in terminal: sudo alsa-force reload
2009-04-10T07:23:00.000Z	Davide	eseven73	I have no idea how to do that I"m noob at linux
2009-04-10T07:24:00.000Z	eseven73	Davide	ok it's very easy, Prefereces> Sound, set it all to ALSA, then alt+F2 and type gnome-terminal and then in that type sudo alsa force-reload
2009-04-10T07:27:00.000Z	Davide	eseven73	not sure where I find "preferences" I'm looking

2009-04-10T07:32:00.000Z	Davide	eseven73	I'm adding "ubuntu Desktop" maybe I'll have the option once I do that
2009-04-10T07:34:00.000Z	eseven73	Davide	is there a reason you use Mythbuntu over Ubuntu?
2009-04-10T07:34:00.000Z	Davide	eseven73	that's the only reason it is hooked up to my TV
2009-04-10T07:35:00.000Z	eseven73	Davide	ok well again I know next to nothing about mythbuntu really, so Im not sure how much further I could help at this point, if my above "Fix" doesnt work for you
2009-04-10T07:36:00.000Z	eseven73	Davide	I would just get regular Ubuntu, and stick some DVR functions in it

2009-04-10T07:43:00.000Z	Davide	eseven73	I didnt' say I was going to "purchase" Windows...

2009-04-10T07:46:00.000Z	eseven73	Davide	if you plan on dual booting, put windows on first
