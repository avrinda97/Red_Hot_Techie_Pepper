2009-08-21T22:17:00.000Z	tdn		How do I make a script run every time the machine is started up, and the network has come up?
2009-08-21T22:19:00.000Z	IdleOne	tdn	cron would be the way but I don't know how to use cron. man cron will help you
2009-08-21T22:19:00.000Z	tdn	IdleOne	isn't cron for things that should be run cronostically?
2009-08-21T22:21:00.000Z	IdleOne	tdn	I believe so but it can also be set to run a script at boot. like I said I don't know how to use it but reading up might get you more info
