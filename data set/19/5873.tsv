2008-07-06T14:11:00.000Z	babo		how do i forcibly reload my local dns cache again ?
2008-07-06T14:11:00.000Z	erichammond	babo	Do you know what dns server /caching server you are running?
2008-07-06T14:12:00.000Z	babo		flush dns or something like that ...
2008-07-06T14:12:00.000Z	babo	erichammond	why does that matter ? I just want to flush the named daemon ...
2008-07-06T14:12:00.000Z	erichammond	babo	Ah, so you're running bind9 :)
2008-07-06T14:12:00.000Z	babo	erichammond	BIND 9.4.1-P1
2008-07-06T14:13:00.000Z	erichammond	babo	Have you tried: /etc/init.d/bind9 restart
2008-07-06T14:13:00.000Z	erichammond	babo	Generally does it for me, but then I find that there are DNS servers upstream with caches I can't affect.
2008-07-06T14:13:00.000Z	babo	erichammond	i could. but i'm specifically looking to flush ...
