2007-01-16T07:53:00.000Z	Hawkins	stefg	that IPv6 link did help a bit with FireFox (15s connect time vs. 35s before) but didn't help for example using system update
2007-01-16T07:54:00.000Z	stefg	Hawkins	your ISP's DNS servers might be a bit slow today... look up another DNS server and try that
2007-01-16T07:56:00.000Z	Hawkins	stefg	don't think it's DNS related problem because my other PC isn't slow at all and different days do not matter either
2007-01-16T07:56:00.000Z	stefg	Hawkins	ok, one point to rule out then
2007-01-16T07:58:00.000Z	stefg	Hawkins	and be aware that ubuntus quickly rising popularity causes some mirrors to be slow at times... the infrastructure can't keep up with the speed of usernumber increase
2007-01-16T07:59:00.000Z	Hawkins	stefg	Ah, yeah, but the problem does appear downloading from local http servers which are working at maximum speed on my other PC
2007-01-16T08:09:00.000Z	Hawkins	stefg	I'm sorry I accidentally turned FF IPv6 option back on as I had week ago turned it off. Network seems to be working as fast as it can on this mighty old Pentium :D Big thanks
2007-05-29T05:43:00.000Z	stefg	Hawkins	desktop effects enabled?
2007-05-29T05:43:00.000Z	Hawkins	stefg	Don't know, how I'll check it ?
2007-05-29T05:44:00.000Z	stefg	Hawkins	they are disabled by default. What machine (cpu/memory/graphics) do you have there?
2007-05-29T05:45:00.000Z	Hawkins	stefg	AMD Athlon64 3800+ / Kingston 2Gb 400Mhz RAM / ATI Radeon X850XT
2007-05-29T05:46:00.000Z	stefg	Hawkins	what does glxinfo | grep direct tell? (use pastebin if there's more than 2 lines of output
2007-05-29T05:47:00.000Z	Hawkins	stefg	it says: direct rendering: Yes
2007-05-29T05:49:00.000Z	stefg	Hawkins	does glxinfo | grep Mesa give anythin?
2007-05-29T05:50:00.000Z	stefg	Hawkins	does glxinfo | grep Mesa give anythin?
2007-05-29T05:51:00.000Z	Hawkins	stefg	OpenGL renderer string: Mesa DRI R300 20060815 x86/MMX+/3DNow!+/SSE2 TCL and on 2nd line OpenGL version string: 1.3 Mesa 6.5.2
2007-05-29T05:51:00.000Z	stefg	Hawkins	i think your 3D acceleration isn't set up properly. You are using software emulation for 3D this is waht makes things so sluggish
2007-05-29T05:52:00.000Z	stefg	Hawkins	i'm no ati expert, but getting ati cards to work properly can be a bit of pain
2007-05-29T05:53:00.000Z	Hawkins	stefg	OK then I need to find a way to get card in operation. Thank you for this. I'll try that link
