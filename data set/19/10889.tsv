2010-10-04T12:59:00.000Z	Lychaeus		anyone know why Ubuntu keeps booting to a black screen?
2010-10-04T13:00:00.000Z	coz_	Lychaeus	 hold on I think I have a link for you
2010-10-04T13:00:00.000Z	coz_	Lychaeus	  here you go    http://it.toolbox.com/blogs/securitymonkey/black-screen-on-boot-with-ubuntu-104-lucid-lynx-solution-38426
2010-10-04T13:03:00.000Z	coz_	Lychaeus	 when having issues with current ubuntu  ,,,in google it always helps to start the search string  with    Ubuntu lucid  and then the issue     that generally give a few hits
2010-10-04T13:03:00.000Z	coz_	Lychaeus	 of course you may have to adjust the search string a bit but ...there it is :)
2010-10-04T13:04:00.000Z	coz_	Lychaeus	 that is not far fetched...hardware can effect how any OS is going to perform  ...I have had client computers that flat out refulsed to allow linux installed
2010-10-04T13:05:00.000Z	coz_	Lychaeus	 right ...older systems can be a bit tricky at times
2010-10-04T13:05:00.000Z	coz_	Lychaeus	 try that boot  option and see if it works
2010-10-04T13:06:00.000Z	coz_	Lychaeus	 mm  off hand  with no experience with booting from usb  I am going to say   probably
2010-10-04T13:06:00.000Z	coz_	Lychaeus	  try it out and test it
2010-10-04T13:06:00.000Z	coz_	Lychaeus	 and if you are booting from usb  that system cannot be super old
2010-10-04T13:08:00.000Z	coz_	Lychaeus	 you tried the "e" and also the holding of shift with that
2010-10-04T13:09:00.000Z	coz_	Lychaeus	  did you install with live cd?
2010-10-04T13:10:00.000Z	coz_	Lychaeus	 you didnt want to install to the hard drive?
2010-10-04T13:11:00.000Z	coz_	Lychaeus	 mm  ..well.. not having the laptop in my hands to see the results  I am not sure what I can say at this point
2010-10-04T13:11:00.000Z	coz_	Lychaeus	 although I have little experience with laptops   ...many many here are using lapttops and would be better suited to troubleshooting this for you
2010-10-04T13:16:00.000Z	coz_	Lychaeus	 maybe what will help?
2010-10-04T13:17:00.000Z	coz_	Lychaeus	 sorry you did indeed  I sometimes dont look for those pm tabs
2010-10-04T13:50:00.000Z	coz_	Lychaeus	 has an issue with booting into lucid from usb   he can get to command prompt but gdm does not start...if someone would PM him he has a live feed from his android
