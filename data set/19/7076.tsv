2007-10-25T18:07:00.000Z	Doomguy0505		For some reason the GDM will say it worked but simply flashes, maybe x11 isn't installed?
2007-10-25T18:07:00.000Z	Doomguy0505		It stops flashing after a while and goes to text-mode login
2007-10-25T18:09:00.000Z	Doomguy0505		i use ati
2007-10-25T18:09:00.000Z	Doomguy0505		I think the x11 isn't loading, because the console fonts aren't smoothened like usual
2007-10-25T18:10:00.000Z	jotil	Doomguy0505	ps el | grep -i x
2007-10-25T18:10:00.000Z	Doomguy0505		I used an upgrade to 7.10 with the alternate cd
2007-10-25T18:11:00.000Z	jotil		do you see x?
2007-10-25T18:11:00.000Z	jotil	Doomguy0505	if it was working with feisty, chances are it will work with Gutsy.
2007-10-25T18:11:00.000Z	Doomguy0505		So why does it not show?
2007-10-25T18:12:00.000Z	jotil	Doomguy0505	check you xorg error log
2007-10-25T18:12:00.000Z	Doomguy0505		where is that?
