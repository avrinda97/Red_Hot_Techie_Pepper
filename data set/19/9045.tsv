2008-06-16T09:36:00.000Z	ShdwShinobi		How can I figure out what is causing ubuntu to freeze up?
2008-06-16T09:36:00.000Z	Ahadiel	ShdwShinobi	You could see what dmesg reports
2008-06-16T09:36:00.000Z	Ahadiel	ShdwShinobi	But other than that, you'd need to be more specific about the freezing.
2008-06-16T09:37:00.000Z	ShdwShinobi	Ahadiel	ubuntu will still run. However, network won't work, sudo hangs, and random features won't work
2008-06-16T09:37:00.000Z	ShdwShinobi		I'll paste my dmesg
2008-06-16T09:37:00.000Z	Ahadiel	ShdwShinobi	Define "network not working" and how do you know that sudo is hanging?
2008-06-16T09:38:00.000Z	ShdwShinobi	Ahadiel	by that it means I can't access the network. When I do a sudo command, it just stays there. nothing happens and I can't ctrl+c out of it. Dmesg: http://pastebin.com/d7fb1d24
2008-06-16T09:39:00.000Z	Ahadiel	ShdwShinobi	Are you connected to the wireless network right now? (Assuming you aren't wired)
2008-06-16T09:39:00.000Z	ShdwShinobi		Correct, I'm using ndiswrapper as well
2008-06-16T09:40:00.000Z	Ahadiel	ShdwShinobi	Does connecting via nm-applet return an error?
2008-06-16T09:40:00.000Z	ShdwShinobi	Ahadiel	nope. It connected just fine
2008-06-16T09:40:00.000Z	Ahadiel	ShdwShinobi	And you can't access the internet?
2008-06-16T09:41:00.000Z	ShdwShinobi		When it happens, I can not. But the nm-applet still says i'm connected.
2008-06-16T09:41:00.000Z	Ahadiel	ShdwShinobi	trying pinging google, ping -c 5 google.com
2008-06-16T09:41:00.000Z	ShdwShinobi		It's working now, but that's one of the first things I tried when it happened and I lost every packet.
2008-06-16T09:43:00.000Z	Ahadiel	ShdwShinobi	Are you doing something in particular when it freezes?
2008-06-16T09:43:00.000Z	ShdwShinobi		No, it doesn't seem to be triggered y anything I do
2008-06-16T09:44:00.000Z	Ahadiel	ShdwShinobi	I'm not sure then =/
2008-06-16T09:44:00.000Z	ShdwShinobi	Ahadiel	ok, thanks for your help
