2007-08-30T13:53:00.000Z	serenityUK	omarr_pr	is this  32bit or 64bit?
2007-08-30T13:54:00.000Z	serenityUK	omarr_pr	i don't think wine works properly in 64bit
2007-08-30T13:55:00.000Z	serenityUK	omarr_pr	are you trying to install via apt-get?
2007-08-30T13:56:00.000Z	serenityUK	omarr_pr	i have wine installed on my 64bit  but only  via synaptic...  apt-get i had similar error... goto System->Admin->Synaptic  and search for wine
2007-08-30T14:02:00.000Z	serenityUK	omarr_pr	you need to go to www.winehq.org   and   look for instructions  to add the  winehq repository for amd64
2007-08-30T14:02:00.000Z	serenityUK	omarr_pr	  then you can install the 64bit version of wine
