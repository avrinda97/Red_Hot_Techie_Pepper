2007-04-22T14:23:00.000Z	BlueStorm	clearzen	error while loading shared libraries: libvorbisfile.so.3: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
2007-04-22T14:25:00.000Z	clearzen	BlueStorm	sounds like a dependancy problem try sudo aptitude search libvorbis .... i dunno what the program is supposed to do but I assume it is video editing/encoding anyway there is packages you need that you do not have.
