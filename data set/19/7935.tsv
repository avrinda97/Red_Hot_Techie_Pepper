2007-06-29T14:11:00.000Z	Hobbsee		<sigh>
2007-06-29T14:13:00.000Z	Hobbsee		is there anyone else who does not wish to behave, and stay on topic, and not act as an op?
2007-06-29T14:13:00.000Z	Hobbsee		when they are not one?
2007-06-29T14:15:00.000Z	Hobbsee		seriously, what are people *on* tonight?
2007-06-29T14:15:00.000Z	shiester_miester	Hobbsee	im not sure
2007-06-29T14:15:00.000Z	Hobbsee	shiester_miester	some form of strong crack, i think
2007-06-29T14:16:00.000Z	Hobbsee	shiester_miester	woulda thought it was kind of obvious not to pick a fight with an op, to say the least...
2007-06-29T14:16:00.000Z	shiester_miester	Hobbsee	you would be surprised what some people think of as 'obvious'
2007-06-29T14:16:00.000Z	Hobbsee	shiester_miester	seeing as the op tends to hold everyone's access to the channel in their hands :P
