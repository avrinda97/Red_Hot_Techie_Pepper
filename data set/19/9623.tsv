2006-10-14T09:20:00.000Z	faceface		how to use apt to find a specific file?
2006-10-14T09:20:00.000Z	faceface		apt-cache search aclocal ... dosn't seem to work
2006-10-14T09:21:00.000Z	faceface		apt-file search OK
2006-10-14T09:21:00.000Z	faceface		apt-file - no such file or dir
2006-10-14T09:21:00.000Z	faceface		command not found I mean
2006-10-14T09:22:00.000Z	faceface		apt-cache search searches description, not files .
2006-10-14T09:23:00.000Z	faceface		OK, installing apt-files :)
2006-10-14T09:23:00.000Z	faceface		<cpk2>, I don't think the results of apt-cache search alocal are correct
2006-10-14T09:25:00.000Z	faceface		hrm... apt-cache search alocal is now not reporting results
2006-10-14T09:25:00.000Z	faceface		heheh - I prolly did
