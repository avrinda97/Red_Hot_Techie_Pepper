2010-11-03T15:00:00.000Z	jits		iptables question .. how do i redirect trafic to a  gateway to a different from my default gateway ..  redirection is required for all traffic from some particular ip address
2010-11-03T15:02:00.000Z	dli	jits	can be done by iptables rules
2010-11-03T15:03:00.000Z	jits	dli	thanks.. i think that can be done .. i tried => sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -s 10.1.23.9 -p tcp -j DNAT --to-destination 10.1.0.7
2010-11-03T15:04:00.000Z	jits	dli	but that did not work :(
2010-11-03T15:05:00.000Z	dli	jits	need to figure out your subnets, all iptables rules
2010-11-03T15:08:00.000Z	jits	dli	i have this server 10.1.0.6 and 10.1.0.10 .. connected different ISPs .. 10.1.0.7 is the dhcp server which has 10.1.0.6 as its default gateway . .. and the dhcp server has other nic giving out dhcp address 10.1.23.xx range.. in that range a particular pc needs to go to 10.1.0.10 instaed of 10.1.0.6
2010-11-03T15:12:00.000Z	dli	jits	iptables -I FORWARD -s 10.1.0.7 -d 10.1.23.0 -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
2010-11-03T15:13:00.000Z	dli	jits	try to accept the traffic of other way, still make sure your routing table sound
2010-11-03T15:15:00.000Z	jits	dli	my route here http://paste.ubuntu.com/524995/
2010-11-03T15:16:00.000Z	dli	jits	iptables -I FORWARD -i eth1 -o usb0 -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
2010-11-03T15:17:00.000Z	jits	dli	 my normal connection is working fine.. the issue is with spl ips i want to take alternate path
2010-11-03T15:18:00.000Z	dli	jits	you want to forward all usb0 to eth1?
2010-11-03T15:18:00.000Z	jits	dli	no . i want only specific ips to go thru that ...
2010-11-03T15:20:00.000Z	dli	jits	not a problem, just add -[sd] IP/mask to iptables rules, I will give you a script example to do usb0->eth1
2010-11-03T15:21:00.000Z	jits	dli	yeah please do .. i need some ips assigned by usb0 to go thru eth1 to 10.1.0.10 instead of 10.1.0.6 which is default gateway of 10.1.0.7(eth1)
2010-11-03T15:28:00.000Z	dli	jits	try: http://pastebin.ca/1980541
2010-11-03T15:33:00.000Z	dli	jits	I think I misunderstood the problem, hold on one minute

2010-11-03T15:36:00.000Z	dli	jits	your situation is more like multiple ISPs
