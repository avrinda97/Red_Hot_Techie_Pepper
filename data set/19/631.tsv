2011-11-07T21:14:00.000Z	healern		A exe can't install maleware on linux though, right?
2011-11-07T21:14:00.000Z	healern		Well Id like to try to bash at it
2011-11-07T21:15:00.000Z	urlin2u	healern	rootkits will run in any platform if you have a funky p2p your stupid to continue.
2011-11-07T21:22:00.000Z	healern	urlin2u	So if you have already have installed wine, and run a .exe that may or may not be suspicious, how do you confirm whether any damage has been done? And if so, mitigate said damage?
2011-11-07T21:23:00.000Z	urlin2u	healern	never ran wine I wold not know.
2011-11-07T21:26:00.000Z	urlin2u	healern	there are various av scanners for linux but if you have not ran your user password your probably safe, that is the key here root access generally.
2011-11-07T21:27:00.000Z	healern	urlin2u	Well finding a AV for linux seems a harder task then finding a PW cracker for it
2011-11-07T21:28:00.000Z	healern	urlin2u	All sorts of ones I have tried have had issues of one kind or another, and the one I did find that works has now expired
2011-11-07T21:28:00.000Z	urlin2u	healern	if you have to crack the password and you can't confirm its legitimacy your acting stupid.
2011-11-07T21:35:00.000Z	healern	urlin2u	the point is that I can't travel back in time, so if you might help me with my current situation rather then criticize me for what I should have done differently, that would be appreciated
2011-11-07T21:38:00.000Z	urlin2u	healern	I was just staing the obvious don't take it personally, we are not here to fix things you have done by not thinking through what your doing, if you acted without thinking then realize that.
2011-11-07T21:45:00.000Z	urlin2u	healern	don't just believe what you hear including here investigate using a correct inquiry method.
2011-11-07T21:46:00.000Z	healern	urlin2u	I take what I hear with a grain of salt, and I am not sure what "correct inquiry methods" you mean
2011-11-07T21:47:00.000Z	urlin2u	healern	if you were a scientist it would be peer reviewed data from research you can use the same methid here.
2011-11-07T21:49:00.000Z	healern	urlin2u	Scientists have mutual understanding of the subject and laboratory environments to test things out, I am a linux newbie and I could muck around with files for a long awhile and not learn much of anything, they are hardly comparable
2011-11-07T21:50:00.000Z	urlin2u	healern	hehe so who is running half the servers on the web and all of them at google the opensuse OS at the large hadron collider?
2011-11-07T21:51:00.000Z	healern	urlin2u	I only half understood that, and the half I did barely helped me understand it as a complete thought
2011-11-07T21:53:00.000Z	urlin2u	healern	I'm not surprised hehe just be careful don't mess with stuff that is well known to possibly be a problem like p2p stuff that needs a password to crack it.
2011-11-07T22:40:00.000Z	urlin2u	healern	it is a quieter channel you will actually get stuff done faster.:D
