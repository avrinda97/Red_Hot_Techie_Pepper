2009-08-12T10:34:00.000Z	Kris07		Can someone help?
2009-08-12T10:35:00.000Z	Revrus	Kris07	please use pastebin instead of pasting into irc, it makes it much easier to read, and stops you from getting kicked by floodbot
2009-08-12T10:38:00.000Z	Revrus	Kris07	are you using the updater program or installing from a disc, if your using a disc, make sure you burn it at a very low speed, and if your using the updater, make sure you dont have your cd drive as a repository, otherwise, i cant be of much help
2009-08-12T10:39:00.000Z	Kris07	Revrus	I'm using the upgrade program. And I don't think I'm using the my cd drive as a repository. How can I check and fix it if I am though?
2009-08-12T10:41:00.000Z	Revrus	Kris07	go to administration -> software sources, and make sure CDrom with Ubuntu XXX is unchecked, then in updates, make sure "Release Upgrade" is set to Normal Releases
2009-08-12T10:47:00.000Z	Kris07	Revrus	there was another error with that, but I can't put it into pastebin to show you because I'm tripping the spam filter
2009-08-12T10:47:00.000Z	Revrus	Kris07	you cannot use http://pastebin.com/ ?
2009-08-12T10:48:00.000Z	Kris07	Revrus	I'm trying but I keep tripping the spam filter
2009-08-12T10:49:00.000Z	Revrus	Kris07	what about http://paste.ubuntu.com/
2009-08-12T10:51:00.000Z	Kris07	Revrus	nevermind, it seems to be working now.
2009-08-12T10:51:00.000Z	Revrus	Kris07	the entire update?
2009-08-12T10:52:00.000Z	Kris07	Revrus	Yeah, its downloading right now
2009-08-12T10:52:00.000Z	Revrus	Kris07	good, glad to know its working
2009-08-12T10:53:00.000Z	Kris07	Revrus	Yeah me too. Thanks for your help.
2009-08-12T23:40:00.000Z	Revrus	Kris07	not sure exactly how the ipod does its album art, but with an mp3 player i had, as long as you have the album art file in the same folder as the song, it should show it
2009-08-12T23:40:00.000Z	Kris07	Revrus	Nah that doesn't work
