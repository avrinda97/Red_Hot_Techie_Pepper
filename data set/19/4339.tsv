2010-08-31T23:14:00.000Z	janisozaur	alfy	the alfy aaaah, source
2010-08-31T23:16:00.000Z	janisozaur	alfy	kernel.org
2010-08-31T23:16:00.000Z	janisozaur	alfy	apt-get source linux-...
2010-08-31T23:17:00.000Z	janisozaur	alfy	"apt-get source <package>" will get the source of the package into your cwd. do not run it as root
2010-08-31T23:18:00.000Z	janisozaur	alfy	then why don't you just execute it?
2010-08-31T23:20:00.000Z	janisozaur	alfy	alfy you don't install the source
2010-08-31T23:20:00.000Z	janisozaur	alfy	and source != headers
2010-08-31T23:20:00.000Z	janisozaur	alfy	what do you want to do?
2010-08-31T23:22:00.000Z	janisozaur	alfy	why do you need kernel sources? what for?
2010-08-31T23:22:00.000Z	janisozaur	alfy	don't get me wrong, but fiddling kernel is a bit trickier than getting its sources
