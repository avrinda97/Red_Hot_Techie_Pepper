2007-12-16T10:21:00.000Z	Skrypt		I'm using a LiveCD and am trying to copy files from one of my hard drives to my external hard drive but am getting "You do not have permissions to write to this folder."  chmod +x and chown -R haven't worked :/ Help?
2007-12-16T10:21:00.000Z	lockd	Skrypt	well, chmodding +x does nothing for write
2007-12-16T10:23:00.000Z	Skrypt	lockd	ntfs 3.1. do I need ntfs-3g?
2007-12-16T10:25:00.000Z	lockd	Skrypt	you need ntfs-3g to write too, forgot about that
2007-12-16T10:25:00.000Z	Skrypt	lockd	can i do that on a live cd?
2007-12-16T10:26:00.000Z	lockd	Skrypt	I have no idea, but I'm fairly sure not - which limits a livecd's use for rescuing a system
2007-12-16T10:30:00.000Z	Skrypt	lockd	if I formet the ntfs external to ext3, problem solved, right?
2007-12-16T10:30:00.000Z	lockd	Skrypt	oh, you don't care about the files on it?
2007-12-16T10:31:00.000Z	Skrypt	lockd	I don't care about the files on the external
2007-12-16T10:32:00.000Z	lockd	Skrypt	then blow it away, but of course it will only work on Linux/Mac (and windows with a ton of prodding)
2007-12-16T10:32:00.000Z	lockd	Skrypt	you blow the disk away if you don't care about his data
2007-12-16T10:33:00.000Z	lockd	Skrypt	probably a good idea to "shred" it as well
2007-12-16T10:33:00.000Z	lockd	Skrypt	incase of framing et al
2007-12-16T10:33:00.000Z	lockd	Skrypt	err, etc
2007-12-16T10:33:00.000Z	Skrypt	lockd	yeah but a little snooping first would be nice.
2007-12-16T10:34:00.000Z	lockd	Skrypt	well yeah, but nothing more can happen to him...
2007-12-16T10:36:00.000Z	lockd	Skrypt	copy over stuff, you'll be able to use ext3 wherever it matters. I have an 80gb fat external, but that's just because I need to use so many windows computers
2007-12-16T10:36:00.000Z	Skrypt	lockd	there's a really great windows driver for reading/writing ext2/3
2007-12-16T10:37:00.000Z	lockd	Skrypt	well, when you work with locked down windows machines...
