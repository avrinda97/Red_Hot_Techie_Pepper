2006-06-29T16:46:00.000Z	ara		does someone has experience dual booting?
2006-06-29T16:47:00.000Z	ara		windows & ubuntu
2006-06-29T16:48:00.000Z	ara		my windows XP won't start anymore.. after installing ubuntu
2006-06-29T16:48:00.000Z	ara		my bootrecord?
2006-06-29T16:48:00.000Z	ara		nah
2006-06-29T16:49:00.000Z	ara		I can boot ubuntu though
2006-06-29T16:49:00.000Z	stefg	ara	please paste your /etc/grub/menu.lst to the pastebin, maybe the 'chainloader' for win isn't called correctly
2006-06-29T16:51:00.000Z	stefg	ara	see /topic
2006-06-29T05:04:00.000Z	stefg	ara	then i doubt that this has somthing to do with ubuntu
2006-06-29T05:49:00.000Z	ara	stefg	I posted the fdisk..
2006-06-29T05:51:00.000Z	stefg	ara	i got it... your partiton table is a mess ...
2006-06-29T05:53:00.000Z	stefg	ara	i got it... your partiton table is a mess ...
2006-06-29T05:55:00.000Z	stefg	ara	make a complete backup, reinitialize the disk... i think the problem with Win not booting is the Compaq service partition... it has to be the first. And wtf is sda1? some sort of other boot-manager?
2006-06-29T05:57:00.000Z	stefg	ara	Listen... your partiton table was broken before, so the ubuntu install just revealed this brokenness... Do yourself a favour: Make a complete Backup and clean up your harddrive. Gaining a backup never hurts
2006-06-29T06:01:00.000Z	stefg	ara	i could give you a suggestion how to partiton your drive BEFORE installing XP... But you'll need a complete backup before
2006-06-29T06:04:00.000Z	stefg	ara	no, you can Xp tell to install to a specific partiton (given you have a proper XP installation medium, not a OEM-recovery thing)
2006-06-29T06:06:00.000Z	stefg	ara	Bad news... blame the vendor. Then your only option is using a really clever partition imaging program... the procedure would be: 1.) backup 2.) do the recover install 3.) make room for ubuntu then with gparted 4.) install ubuntu
2006-06-29T06:08:00.000Z	stefg	ara	But wiping the disk is pretty much mandatory ...
2006-06-29T06:14:00.000Z	stefg	ara	I assume that the recovery disk will completly erase everything... the whole disk
