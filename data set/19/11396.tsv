2006-06-09T14:08:00.000Z	stephan__		how do i make a filesystem reiserFS?
2006-06-09T14:08:00.000Z	intelikey	stephan__	convert to rieser ????  eeek.   or just format to rieserfs ?
2006-06-09T14:09:00.000Z	stephan__	intelikey	format
2006-06-09T14:09:00.000Z	intelikey	stephan__	mkfs.rieser /dev/blah
2006-06-09T14:10:00.000Z	intelikey	stephan__	example  sudo mkfs.rieserfs /dev/hda1
2006-06-09T14:10:00.000Z	intelikey	stephan__	example2  sudo mkfs.rieser4 /dev/sdb3
2006-06-09T14:10:00.000Z	stephan__	intelikey	command not found :/
2006-06-09T14:11:00.000Z	intelikey	stephan__	tab key is your friend.   mkfs.[tab] [tab] 
2006-06-09T14:12:00.000Z	intelikey	stephan__	it's called tab-completion   bash is funny that way....
2006-06-09T14:17:00.000Z	stephan__	intelikey	mkreiserfs was the command:o
2006-06-09T14:18:00.000Z	intelikey	stephan__	depends on where.  that looks like a busybox command.   doing it from an install cd ?
2006-06-12T08:21:00.000Z	intelikey	stephan__	man chmod
2006-06-12T08:22:00.000Z	intelikey	stephan__	 short answer   chmod [args]  inode
2006-06-12T08:23:00.000Z	intelikey	stephan__	seeing that you are wanting access to something you don't have access to may i ask what it is ?    (incase any sujestions or warnings should be issued)
2006-06-12T08:24:00.000Z	stephan__	intelikey	i put someone quake3 files in a reiserfs filesystem but i can only play the game in root
2006-06-12T08:25:00.000Z	intelikey	stephan__	k chmod it
2006-06-12T08:25:00.000Z	stephan__	intelikey	 ok
2006-06-12T08:25:00.000Z	intelikey	stephan__	if you need exec    chmod +x file
2006-06-12T08:27:00.000Z	intelikey	stephan__	only reason i asked is people come in here, it's their first day ever seeing linux and they ask how to make all files 777   and you just don't do things like that.
