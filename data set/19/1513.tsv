2011-01-06T09:43:00.000Z	Danny78_		VOtalent:  What kind of studio?  programming?  arts?
2011-01-06T09:43:00.000Z	Blue1	Danny78_	did you md5sum check it?
2011-01-06T09:44:00.000Z	Danny78_		Blue1--  no but I should.  It's damn small linux
2011-01-06T09:44:00.000Z	Blue1	Danny78_	i have 10.04 on a 733 mhz compaq deskpro with 384 meg o ram
2011-01-06T09:45:00.000Z	Danny78_	Blue1	 It boots and says in a boxed window that there's a bootable cd in the drive, and then it hangs during bootup, just freezes  (has 256MB RAM, AMD K62
2011-01-06T09:46:00.000Z	Blue1	Danny78_	are you doing the desktop install or the alternatate install?  256 m is pretty slim
2011-01-06T09:46:00.000Z	Danny78_		I wrote on it "Mini ubuntu 10.04.1"
2011-01-06T09:48:00.000Z	Blue1	Danny78_	that;s meaningless
2011-01-06T09:48:00.000Z	Danny78_	Blue1	 it was supposed to be the most stripped down for old comps, from the Ubuntu site
2011-01-06T09:48:00.000Z	Blue1	Danny78_	in my experience with the compaq, I had to do the alternate install
2011-01-06T09:49:00.000Z	Danny78_	Blue1	 You think a 500MHz processor could handle it?
2011-01-06T09:49:00.000Z	Blue1	Danny78_	I have never heard of mini ubuntu what is the url for it?
2011-01-06T09:49:00.000Z	Blue1	Danny78_	yes
2011-01-06T09:49:00.000Z	Danny78_	Blue1	 one sec
2011-01-06T09:50:00.000Z	Danny78_	Blue1	 https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD
2011-01-06T09:50:00.000Z	Danny78_		they're between 7 and 12 MB
2011-01-06T09:51:00.000Z	Blue1	Danny78_	okay that's already using the alternate install (text based) which makes sense -- I'd md5sum that sucker
2011-01-06T09:51:00.000Z	Blue1	Danny78_	and on a machine that old, you need to write (burn) the disc at the slowest speed -- 1X if possible
2011-01-06T09:52:00.000Z	Danny78_	Blue1	 yeah, I reading into that cause it's been years, and yes I know that's really bad practice
