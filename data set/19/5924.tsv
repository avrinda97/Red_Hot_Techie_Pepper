2008-04-15T18:33:00.000Z	carldani		hi, is it possible to create an ubuntu live usb key without having to boot ubuntu? the wiki suggests I have to boot ubuntu and install to usb
2008-04-15T18:33:00.000Z	bazhang	carldani	from windows? sure can be done
2008-04-15T18:33:00.000Z	carldani	bazhang	no, from linux
2008-04-15T18:38:00.000Z	carldani	bazhang	the www.pendrivelinux.com tutorial explicitly says I have to boot ubuntu to create the live usb pen drive image. any tutorial which does not require booting ubuntu and can work from a running linux system will be appreciated
2008-04-15T18:38:00.000Z	bazhang	carldani	what is your final goal? to dual boot linux/linux; or replace current linux with ubuntu or other
2008-04-15T18:40:00.000Z	carldani	bazhang	I have a working linux machine (my desktop) which I can't reboot due to long-running programs. I'd like to use this machine to create a bootable usb flash drive for my thincan/linutop thin client. The thin client can only boot from usb.
2008-04-15T18:41:00.000Z	bazhang	carldani	does the thin client have some OS on it now? or is it using the desktop as a thick client
2008-04-15T18:42:00.000Z	carldani	bazhang	the thin client is completely empty. no os whatsoever.
2008-04-15T18:44:00.000Z	bazhang	carldani	you dont need to boot ubuntu, but you need at least an ubuntu iso (or the necessary files to copy over) to create the bootable usb stick
2008-04-15T18:45:00.000Z	carldani	bazhang	the iso is on my disk.
2008-04-15T18:46:00.000Z	bazhang	carldani	the instructions on the site are insufficiently clear?
2008-04-15T18:48:00.000Z	carldani	bazhang	no, the installation instructions assume ubuntu has been booted from cd and I have verified that they will not work if ubuntu has not been booted from cd
2008-04-15T18:49:00.000Z	carldani	bazhang	booting ubuntu from cd does some setup automatically which is not mentioned explicitly in any of the guides
2008-04-15T18:49:00.000Z	bazhang	carldani	what system you running now--which distro
2008-04-15T18:49:00.000Z	carldani	bazhang	opensuse 10.3
2008-04-15T18:51:00.000Z	carldani	bazhang	by the way, the instructions will also not work if you have booted ubuntu, but not from the install cd
2008-04-15T18:54:00.000Z	bazhang	carldani	hmm; I had success with the instructions. what went wrong for you? at any rate the usb option is clearly out for you as it requires a boot regardless of the linux distro including suse
2008-04-15T18:56:00.000Z	carldani	bazhang	I'll try to figure out a way combining the various instructions, if I'm successful, I'll tell you (including what needs to be considered if you don't want to boot from the cd)
2008-04-15T18:57:00.000Z	bazhang	carldani	there are other options but they do not involve a usb stick
