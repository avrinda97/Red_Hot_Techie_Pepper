2009-03-19T12:32:00.000Z	jtaji	lakitu	the < should be >
2009-03-19T12:32:00.000Z	lakitu	jtaji	ok
2009-03-19T13:33:00.000Z	jtaji	lakitu	what happens if you open just the .001 file with 7zip?
2009-03-19T13:33:00.000Z	jtaji	lakitu	first off, have you installed p7zip ?
2009-03-19T13:33:00.000Z	lakitu	jtaji	it doesn't recognize it. & yes
2009-03-19T13:36:00.000Z	lakitu	jtaji	any ideas?
2009-03-19T13:37:00.000Z	lakitu	jtaji	is there a way to test the .001-.006 files?
2009-03-19T13:38:00.000Z	jtaji	lakitu	I don't know, do you know who/what split it?
2009-03-19T13:38:00.000Z	lakitu	jtaji	windows prog, Cobian Backup
2009-03-19T13:38:00.000Z	lakitu	jtaji	i'm *pretty sure* these were good
2009-03-19T13:39:00.000Z	jtaji	lakitu	there's a good chance the files can't simply be cat'd together then
2009-03-19T13:39:00.000Z	lakitu	jtaji	well, i BELIEVE (not positive) i did it once. that's why i'm so discombobulated over this
2009-03-19T13:40:00.000Z	lakitu	jtaji	i'm not missing any arguments/etc to pass to cat?
2009-03-19T13:40:00.000Z	jtaji	lakitu	no the cat command looks good
2009-03-19T13:40:00.000Z	lakitu	jtaji	hm. ok. thanks for the help
2009-03-19T13:47:00.000Z	lakitu	jtaji	thing is, i swore i did this before
2009-03-19T13:58:00.000Z	lakitu	jtaji	ActionParsnip, i'm trying another set now
