2012-06-19T08:52:00.000Z	magnumXopus	tomatosalad	it looks like you're on the internet already
2012-06-19T08:53:00.000Z	tomatosalad	magnumXopus	different computer >_>
2012-06-19T08:55:00.000Z	magnumXopus	tomatosalad	are you referring to using ndiswrapper for a windows driver?
2012-06-19T08:56:00.000Z	magnumXopus	tomatosalad	I have no idea about a macbook
2012-06-19T08:59:00.000Z	magnumXopus	tomatosalad	here is an article that may give some direction at least.  Like which packages to put on your usb. http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1935799

2012-06-19T09:01:00.000Z	magnumXopus	tomatosalad	that looks promising, leave it on your screan and unplug your current ethernet and plug it into the macbook and follow the steps
2012-06-19T09:02:00.000Z	magnumXopus	tomatosalad	is the current computer wireless?
2012-06-19T09:03:00.000Z	magnumXopus	tomatosalad	it looks like you need to download the b43-fwcutter packaga and the broadcom firmware to your usb
2012-06-19T09:04:00.000Z	magnumXopus	tomatosalad	okay so what's the question again?  Sounds like you have it handled.
