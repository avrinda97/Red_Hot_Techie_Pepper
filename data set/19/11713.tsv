2006-10-31T10:29:00.000Z	mike_	sevtastic	how do I get a codec for mp3's
2006-10-31T10:30:00.000Z	sevtastic	mike_	 http://easyubuntu.freecontrib.org/
2006-10-31T10:35:00.000Z	mike_	sevtastic	that has nothing to do with mp3 codecs
2006-10-31T10:36:00.000Z	sevtastic	mike_	it has a lot of codecs. if you just wanna play mp3s then get xmms and use that
2006-10-31T10:37:00.000Z	sevtastic	mike_	 sure it will.
2006-10-31T10:38:00.000Z	mike_	sevtastic	how do you get xmms to play a folder across the network?
2006-10-31T10:38:00.000Z	sevtastic	mike_	you mount the samba share to a folder and then select it through xmms. not much more to it
