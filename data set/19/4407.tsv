2009-08-28T09:00:00.000Z	linux	IdleOne	Thank you.
2009-11-26T05:32:00.000Z	IdleOne	linux	you here to help or just to troll?
2010-05-22T05:56:00.000Z	IdleOne	linux	please don't post links here
2010-05-23T18:40:00.000Z	IdleOne	linux	in the Update Manager you can select what packages you want to install be selecting or deselecting the check box next to them. Like ikonia just mentioned it is not a good idea in any OS to split updates
2010-05-23T18:42:00.000Z	IdleOne	linux	well, we told you how you could do it and we gave you the warning about it's dangers. the system is yours and you may admin it how you please
2010-05-23T18:51:00.000Z	IdleOne	linux	you could download the Alternate CD and do an upgrade with the cd
2010-05-23T19:01:00.000Z	IdleOne	linux	I believe you can also do sudo apt-get upgrade -d
2010-05-23T19:01:00.000Z	IdleOne	linux	the -d switch should download only
2010-05-23T19:02:00.000Z	IdleOne	linux	what do you save?
2010-05-23T19:03:00.000Z	IdleOne	linux	what do you mean by will it save?
2010-05-23T19:06:00.000Z	IdleOne	linux	after you download the updates they will be stored in /
2010-05-23T19:06:00.000Z	IdleOne	linux	/var/cache/apt/archives/ sorry
2010-05-23T19:07:00.000Z	IdleOne	linux	yes they will be .deb files
2010-05-23T19:11:00.000Z	IdleOne	linux	after you run sudo apt-get upgrade -d   and you want to install those debs that have been downloaded you will run sudo apt-get upgrade --no-download (that will install the debs that have been already downloaded)
2010-05-23T19:16:00.000Z	IdleOne	linux	linux: that will install vlc, not sure if using the -d switch with apt-get install is necessary because the .deb will automatically be saved in  /var/cache/apt/archives
2010-06-10T04:40:00.000Z	IdleOne	linux	is a big universe
2010-07-03T09:41:00.000Z	IdleOne	linux	you can run apt-get autoremove like it says if you want to
2011-02-19T10:09:00.000Z	IdleOne	linux	test!
