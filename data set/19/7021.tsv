2007-11-23T15:23:00.000Z	nomad111		i disabled ipv6 in firefox and that made no change
2007-11-23T15:23:00.000Z	nomad111		i have cable
2007-11-23T15:23:00.000Z	nomad111		and its much faster in windows
2007-11-23T15:23:00.000Z	nomad111		im starting to use windows more than ubuntu and its getting annoying enough
2007-11-23T15:25:00.000Z	nomad111		hasnt anyone had my problem
2007-11-23T15:25:00.000Z	nomad111		firefox takes 30 seconds to load any page
2007-11-23T15:25:00.000Z	nomad111		then it works fast
2007-11-23T15:25:00.000Z	nomad111		but the initial delay is killing me
2007-11-23T15:26:00.000Z	nomad111		i dont know whats causing and im sure its not my isp or connection because it runs flawlessly under windows
2007-11-23T15:27:00.000Z	Guillem_	nomad111	if you reaload the page is it fast?
2007-11-23T15:27:00.000Z	Guillem_	nomad111	in that case, looks like you have problems with the nameservers: check /etc/resolv.conf
2007-11-23T15:40:00.000Z	Guillem_	nomad111	some broadcom cards do not work well...
2007-11-23T15:41:00.000Z	Guillem_	nomad111	I've had bad experiences with some of them
2007-11-23T15:41:00.000Z	Guillem_	nomad111	hmm my dell9400 has no network issues with gutsy.
2007-11-23T15:45:00.000Z	Guillem_	nomad111	try starting the laptop with the option "pci=noacpi" at the kernel
2007-11-23T15:45:00.000Z	Guillem_	nomad111	I've seen a HP laptop with network problems solved with that...
2007-11-23T15:46:00.000Z	Guillem_	nomad111	I *think* it had a broadcom card....
2007-11-23T15:46:00.000Z	Guillem_	nomad111	kevev seems wiser than me, anyway.
