2010-11-23T04:34:00.000Z	ubuntu4shane	intrader	what is the problem?
2010-11-23T04:37:00.000Z	intrader	ubuntu4shane	until Nov 10th, I could connect a USB stick with FAT volum and navigate in the folder to a .sh file. When I clicked on the .sh file, a dialog would pop to ask me whether to execute the .sh file. and when I said yes, the Smalltalk IDE would start and execute.
2010-11-23T04:38:00.000Z	ubuntu4shane	intrader	ok, and now when you double click on a sh file, it doesn't?
2010-11-23T04:38:00.000Z	intrader	ubuntu4shane	now, now it does not, it wants to open the text editor. The .sh file is not executable anymore.
2010-11-23T04:39:00.000Z	ubuntu4shane	intrader	ok, it is the file association
2010-11-23T04:39:00.000Z	ubuntu4shane	intrader	right click on a sh file and select properties
2010-11-23T04:41:00.000Z	ubuntu4shane	intrader	after that click on the permissions tab, and make sure the box is checked that says Executable
2010-11-23T04:41:00.000Z	ubuntu4shane	intrader	I mean allow executing file as program
2010-11-23T04:42:00.000Z	intrader	ubuntu4shane	 right click on the file gives me a tab with permissions, in it there is an execute checkbox, when I check it, it momentarily checks but the it unchecks.
2010-11-23T04:42:00.000Z	ubuntu4shane	intrader	that is because you are working on FAT filesystem, and I think* that FAT doesn't allow those kind of permissions.
2010-11-23T04:43:00.000Z	ubuntu4shane	intrader	there is a openwith tab, however I don't see an option that you need, like terminal
2010-11-23T04:43:00.000Z	ubuntu4shane	intrader	probably it would be easier for you to learn to use the terminal, and execute it that way.
2010-11-23T04:45:00.000Z	intrader	ubuntu4shane	 when I navigate to the Smalltalk IDE, it does not associate.
2010-11-23T04:47:00.000Z	ubuntu4shane	intrader	at the bottom it says custom command, just click that and put sh
2010-11-23T04:47:00.000Z	ubuntu4shane	intrader	after that click ok, and now when you double click on it you it will offer to run it.
2010-11-23T04:49:00.000Z	intrader	ubuntu4shane	 it say that "Could not find application' Perhaps because execute permission is not given.
2010-11-23T04:50:00.000Z	ubuntu4shane	intrader	oh, that is possible, I don't have a FAT drive/partition to mess with, but I'm about 96% sure that FAT doesn't do permissions
2010-11-23T04:51:00.000Z	intrader	ubuntu4shane	st__, maco, I must leave for a bit, thanks for the help. That is correct, until a couple of weeks ago I could do .sh files in FAT volumes.
2010-11-23T04:52:00.000Z	ubuntu4shane	intrader	yes, I can't explain why you could do it before, and can't now, that is odd, it isn't terrible hard to use terminal and do the same thing as a work around, catch ya later.
