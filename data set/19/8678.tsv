2007-08-27T10:32:00.000Z	sahil		hey guys, i am in a big mess. My windows is acting crazy and all i get is a black screen when i boot into it. Luckily i have Ubuntu, but i cannot use my USB stick. It says unable to mount and that i should shut down windows properly, or unmount the drive properly from windows or run ntfsfix in linux. SInce i cant do the first 2, can someone help me on what to do
2007-08-27T10:33:00.000Z	sahil		yeah
2007-08-27T10:33:00.000Z	sahil		but this has never happened b4
2007-08-27T10:33:00.000Z	sahil		yup
2007-08-27T10:34:00.000Z	sahil		i have been using linux for over 6 months now, and everything is fine, i love linux, the problem is with windows and ntfs
2007-08-27T10:34:00.000Z	sahil		windows
2007-08-27T10:34:00.000Z	deviantintegral	sahil	it sounds like your USB stick is formatted with NTFS. After you fix it, you should format it as FAT32 to copy your data back on.
2007-08-27T10:34:00.000Z	sahil		can i format it to fat32 on linux, and if so how?
2007-08-27T10:34:00.000Z	sahil		my USB stick is NTFS and wlinux will not mount it
2007-08-27T10:35:00.000Z	sahil		linux would mount it fine b4 this, but now im in a tizzy
2007-08-27T10:36:00.000Z	sahil		because my windows is on an NTFS drive, and my USB stick is formatted as NTFS and for some reason Ubuntu says it cannot mount it and i should run ntfsfix and that i have an unclean ntfs log file
2007-08-27T10:37:00.000Z	sahil	neverblue	you know what i can do
2007-08-27T10:38:00.000Z	sahil	neverblue	nope
2007-08-27T10:38:00.000Z	sahil		bcuz they are both NTFS and Ubuntu says i have an unclean ntfs log file, thats why
2007-08-27T10:38:00.000Z	deviantintegral	sahil	so why not just unplug your uUSB key?
2007-08-27T10:39:00.000Z	deviantintegral		I answered my own question: iostat needs a time parameter otherwise it shows stats since boot
2007-08-27T10:39:00.000Z	sahil	neverblue	yeah even when I boot without the USB
2007-08-27T10:39:00.000Z	sahil		deviantintergral unplug the usb key and then what?
2007-08-27T10:39:00.000Z	deviantintegral	sahil	and then boot?
