2010-10-14T07:34:00.000Z	liquidmeson_	manu__	the sda3 is just a name, give us more info. ex, i need more space for my windows install or windows dosen't show in the menu
2010-10-14T07:36:00.000Z	liquidmeson_	manu__	applications >accessories > terminal, type in: sudo update-grub
2010-10-14T07:37:00.000Z	liquidmeson_	manu__	are windows and ubuntu in the same computer
2010-10-14T07:40:00.000Z	liquidmeson_	manu__	so when you turn on the computer you see ubuntu, it works good?
2010-10-14T07:41:00.000Z	liquidmeson_	manu__	what windows was on there before? 7 xp, vista?
2010-10-14T07:42:00.000Z	liquidmeson_	manu__	put in the 7 disk and look for a repair option

2010-10-14T07:44:00.000Z	manu__	liquidmeson_	I nither have a cd nor a second usb stick nor a burner
2010-10-14T07:46:00.000Z	liquidmeson_	manu__	so if you don't have the windows disk then there is no way to have ONLY windows on the laptop.. I would recomend using the usb stick and booting ubuntu
2010-10-14T07:47:00.000Z	liquidmeson_	manu__	when you open the installer do you see windows?
2010-10-14T07:48:00.000Z	liquidmeson_	manu__	the ubuntu live usb should have a installer on the desktop
2010-10-14T07:50:00.000Z	manu__	liquidmeson_	i need windows 7 again .... and this is installed on sda1
2010-10-14T07:51:00.000Z	liquidmeson_	manu__	before windows starts there is a loader (windows boot strap or grub) it seems your missing the windows boot strap and no grub... so you have to install grub since you have no windows cd
2010-10-14T07:54:00.000Z	manu__	liquidmeson_	it is a hp notebook, i changed the boot order to usb, harddrive, ... to get online somehow ... we linux has a kind of bootloader, but i don't really know which bootloader
