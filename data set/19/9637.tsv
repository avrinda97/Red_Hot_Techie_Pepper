2008-01-31T08:22:00.000Z	LockesRabb	singlesun	i'm deaf, so i don't know if it's emitting any sounds ;p

2008-01-31T08:24:00.000Z	LockesRabb	singlesun	-- i'd much rather NOT be deaf, i hate it, and i prefer not to mention it, i wouldn't have mentioned it if u hadnt asked me if i could hear it
2008-01-31T08:25:00.000Z	dsnyders	LockesRabb	have you tried mplayer.  I find it works much better than totem.

2008-01-31T08:27:00.000Z	dsnyders	LockesRabb	I'm pretty sure it does.  It is quite flexible
