2007-02-19T09:39:00.000Z	kjon	arrenlex	I guess it might be easier to try a grub, "root (hd0,0)", and "setup (hd0)".
2007-02-19T09:39:00.000Z	arrenlex	kjon	You know what you doing (move Zig) :)
2007-02-19T09:40:00.000Z	kjon	arrenlex	^.^
2007-02-19T09:40:00.000Z	arrenlex	kjon	Except that root should be 1,5, no?
2007-02-19T09:40:00.000Z	kjon	arrenlex	dunno... I wasn't reading ;)
2007-02-19T09:43:00.000Z	kjon	arrenlex	Another way might be to try an chroot....
2007-02-19T09:43:00.000Z	arrenlex	kjon	That's what I was going to do to him.
2007-02-19T09:43:00.000Z	kjon	arrenlex	copying the mtab... and blah blah blah (the gentoo way)
2007-02-19T09:44:00.000Z	arrenlex	kjon	Why do you need to copy the mtab if the system is already installed? You only need to mount /proc, and then grub-install /dev/sda. I've done it tons of times.
2007-02-19T09:44:00.000Z	kjon	arrenlex	nopes, because grub-install relies on mtab, and not on /proc.
2007-02-19T09:45:00.000Z	kjon	arrenlex	grub, sometimes, can be very... buy very stupid.
2007-02-19T09:45:00.000Z	arrenlex	kjon	Then how do you explain that I've done it so many times successfully?
2007-02-19T09:45:00.000Z	kjon	arrenlex	. ... ok ok... you won... :)
2007-02-19T09:46:00.000Z	kjon	arrenlex	chroot way... isn't it?
2007-02-19T09:47:00.000Z	arrenlex	kjon	Yeah.
2007-02-19T09:48:00.000Z	arrenlex	kjon	You don't need to build them, they're available in the giftshop! Also pick up an "I killed arrenlex and all I got was this lousy t-shirt" tshirt!
2007-02-19T09:49:00.000Z	kjon	arrenlex	cool! I'm going to pick one of those...
2007-02-19T09:49:00.000Z	arrenlex	kjon	Okay, I lost. Your turn. xD
2007-02-19T09:51:00.000Z	arrenlex	kjon	(20:48:40) mbrnoob: /dev/sda: Not found or not a block device.
