2006-07-14T15:02:00.000Z	DerDracle		Um, I'm using Dapper, and, for some reason the g++ compiler is 4.0, but gcj is 4.1--- and there doesn't seem to be a g++-4.1 package.
2006-07-14T15:03:00.000Z	DerDracle		So, I'm having to specify the 'entire' library path for g++ 4.1 (where gcj4.1 installs the .h files etc) to compile binaries.
2006-07-14T15:03:00.000Z	DerDracle		Is there a repository somewhere with g++-4.1 in it?
2006-07-14T15:05:00.000Z	DerDracle		Hm.
2006-07-14T15:07:00.000Z	DerDracle		Hm.
2006-07-14T15:07:00.000Z	DerDracle		The package I want appears to be in "Edgy."
2006-07-14T15:07:00.000Z	ThunderStruck	DerDracle	good chance its broken
2006-07-14T15:08:00.000Z	DerDracle	ThunderStruck	How do I include edgy in my sources.list to find out?
2006-07-14T15:08:00.000Z	ThunderStruck	DerDracle	you dont want to do that
2006-07-14T15:09:00.000Z	DerDracle	ThunderStruck	Do you think trying to install the g++-4.1 .deb package would be a good idea?
2006-07-14T15:09:00.000Z	ThunderStruck	DerDracle	no
2006-07-14T15:10:00.000Z	DerDracle	ThunderStruck	Then, is there 'no' intelligent way to get g++-4.1 working on Dapper?
2006-07-14T15:11:00.000Z	DerDracle	ThunderStruck	Do you know how well g++-4.0 and g++-4.1 produce ABI compatible binaries?
2006-07-14T15:11:00.000Z	ThunderStruck	DerDracle	they are fine but i dont use g++ anymore thank goodness
2006-07-14T15:12:00.000Z	DerDracle	ThunderStruck	I seem to have been able to compile binaries with gcj-4.1, and link them with g++4.0 binaries.
2006-07-14T15:12:00.000Z	DerDracle	ThunderStruck	And it produced a working program.
2006-07-14T15:12:00.000Z	DerDracle	ThunderStruck	What are you using instead?
2006-07-14T15:13:00.000Z	DerDracle	ThunderStruck	Hm, I'd prefer not to as well :0
2006-07-14T15:13:00.000Z	DerDracle	ThunderStruck	I'd prefer C/Ruby here ;) But Python is quite nice. Unfortunately C++ is still widely used. Well this, sucks :p
