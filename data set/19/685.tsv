2011-10-15T16:06:00.000Z	jANaM	can73	Did you connect with wifi?
2011-10-15T16:07:00.000Z	jANaM	can73	Do you connect to wireless router? Our connection stopped working too after the upgrade because it forgot the router password.
2011-10-15T16:09:00.000Z	jANaM	can73	You must open network settings (just click on the icon) and then enter settings for your wireless connection and there we added the password (it was blank for WPA2)
2011-10-15T16:12:00.000Z	jANaM	can73	Did you do the same?
2011-10-15T16:12:00.000Z	can73	jANaM	what was it you did
2011-10-15T16:12:00.000Z	jANaM	can73	Ok, try this. You know it worked for us, so it could work for you.
2011-10-15T16:13:00.000Z	jANaM	can73	Do you need help to open it?
2011-10-15T16:17:00.000Z	jANaM	can73	What if you choose "Dynamic WEP (802.1x)? It lets you enter a password.
2011-10-15T16:17:00.000Z	can73	jANaM	ill try that
2011-10-15T16:19:00.000Z	jANaM	can73	If it works, plz tell me. If it doesn't work, plz tell me.
2011-10-15T16:19:00.000Z	can73	jANaM	After i put in the pass, i got a grayed out button for save meaning something wrong
2011-10-15T16:20:00.000Z	jANaM	can73	Uhm, sorry I got no experience with WEP.
2011-10-15T16:21:00.000Z	can73	jANaM	i wish ubuntu had customer support number
