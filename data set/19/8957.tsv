2009-06-19T18:06:00.000Z	scunizi	Pici	are the packages you download from the repos when running 64bit, are they compiled as 64bit as well?
2009-06-19T18:08:00.000Z	Pici	scunizi	Each architecture requries that the binaries be compiled for them separately, so yes.

2010-01-28T18:59:00.000Z	scunizi	Pici	lenswipe correct.. webmin isn't supported because it changes some file settings that get borked on some upgrades, patches etc.. I think the supported package is ebox or something similar
