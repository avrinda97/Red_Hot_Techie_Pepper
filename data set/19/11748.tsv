2005-11-25T11:27:00.000Z	LjL		what was the recommended (?) repository for bleeding-edge Wine? was it simply the WineHQ repository? (I thought it was in Ubotu, but it's not)
2005-11-25T11:29:00.000Z	LjL		!tell _hello_ about repos
2005-11-25T11:29:00.000Z	psychocat	LjL	check this out, should work http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=29996&highlight=wine
2005-11-25T11:30:00.000Z	psychocat	LjL	you can build it from CVS if you want the latest
2005-11-25T11:30:00.000Z	LjL	psychocat	yep i know, but i don't want to compile it, i was just positive that some sort of bleeding-edge (or recent, anyway) repository was mentioned a few times here
2005-11-25T11:34:00.000Z	psychocat	LjL	maybe it's this one, I don't remember -> deb http://wine.sourceforge.net/apt/ binary/
2005-11-25T11:35:00.000Z	LjL	psychocat	quite possibly!
2005-12-01T08:49:00.000Z	LjL	psychocat	ah ok
2005-12-01T08:57:00.000Z	psychocat	LjL	it's on the english version too, lol
2005-12-01T08:58:00.000Z	LjL	psychocat	well, i supposed so, but couldn't be sure, never read the english version (though i should, as i have some hundred megabytes of saved comics in english ;)
2005-12-01T08:58:00.000Z	psychocat	LjL	holy cow
2005-12-01T08:59:00.000Z	LjL	psychocat	well my Debian server is downloading the new strips every night... there's a program specifically to download comics
2005-12-01T08:59:00.000Z	LjL	psychocat	i mean, a program in the Debian reps
2005-12-01T09:00:00.000Z	LjL	psychocat	it's "dailystrips" and i've found it in the ubuntu reps as well :)
2005-12-01T09:00:00.000Z	psychocat	LjL	i get the dilbert comic sent to my work pc everyday.
2005-12-01T09:00:00.000Z	LjL	psychocat	i have them on my debian
2005-12-01T09:00:00.000Z	LjL	psychocat	i have them on my debian's internal webserver
2005-12-01T09:00:00.000Z	psychocat	LjL	nice :)
2005-12-01T09:04:00.000Z	LjL	psychocat	put them on the webserver so that the rest of my family could read them too, but they're too lazy to learn enough english to understand comics ;-\ i should find an handwriting-OCR and a decent machine translator... hey, perhaps i'll have them in 20 years or so :)
