2010-02-18T21:53:00.000Z	FunkyWeasel		Had an old bug greet me on a new pc today - good old screensaver-crashing-when-you-type-in-the-wrong-password.
2010-02-18T21:53:00.000Z	FunkyWeasel		Has anyone ever experienced the gnome-screensaver crash-on-wrong-password and, heaven forbid, found a solution?
2010-02-18T21:55:00.000Z	FunkyWeasel		Not that I don't love rebooting if I am stupid enough to get my screensaver password wrong, of course.  I *swear* I reboot more often than I ever did with XP.
2010-02-18T21:55:00.000Z	diago	FunkyWeasel	what do you mean
2010-02-18T21:57:00.000Z	FunkyWeasel	diago	On an older pc gnome-screensaver would lock up with the message 'checking...' if I typed in the wrong password when unlocking the screensaver.  Now the same thing is happening on my current pc.   (The comment about rebooting combines my sound locking in a loop once a week which also can ONLY BE RESOLVED by a reboot)
2010-02-18T21:58:00.000Z	diago	FunkyWeasel	you can of course restart any service without rebooting. But the lock ups sound strange
2010-02-18T21:59:00.000Z	FunkyWeasel	diago	Yeah, so I heard.  Pity it's not true when the sound gets stuck into a repeating loop.  Likewise if the screensaver gets stuck in a 'checking password' loop you have to do a hardware reset.
2010-02-18T22:00:00.000Z	diago	FunkyWeasel	ctl+alt+F2 doesn't bring up a console?
2010-02-18T22:00:00.000Z	FunkyWeasel	diago	I have found NOTHING that stop the soundloop problem apart from rebooting, which was the only recommendation I got in the past from this chan.  Which is fair enough - it's nice to know that sound is so broken on ibex for my pc that I don't have to waste time looking for a solution, if you want a silver lining.
2010-02-18T22:00:00.000Z	FunkyWeasel	diago	nope
2010-02-18T22:02:00.000Z	FunkyWeasel	diago	GeForce 6150SE nForce 430, using nVidia drivers.  I've since rebooted (it's my work PC so I don't have the luxury of taking a few hours to research) so I can't really run any additional tests.
2010-02-18T22:04:00.000Z	FunkyWeasel	diago	Yup
2010-02-18T22:04:00.000Z	diago	FunkyWeasel	why not upgrade?
2010-02-18T22:05:00.000Z	FunkyWeasel	diago	It's a work pc - in short I don't have time atm.
2010-02-18T22:06:00.000Z	FunkyWeasel	diago	Yeah, key 5 words there ;)
2010-02-18T22:07:00.000Z	FunkyWeasel	diago	Ideally I'd like to do a fresh install rather than building on top of cruft, but I'd need another box to do that.
2010-02-18T22:08:00.000Z	FunkyWeasel	diago	But I can't really allow my pc to get to a potentially unusable state atm.
2010-02-18T22:08:00.000Z	diago	FunkyWeasel	You could do an install to an external and get it ready on that machine
2010-02-18T22:10:00.000Z	FunkyWeasel	diago	True.  Hopefully the company's springing for a laptop for us soonish though
