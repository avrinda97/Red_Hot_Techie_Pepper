2008-08-07T08:39:00.000Z	NemesisD		complaining to adobe, that sounds like it will work...
2008-08-07T08:39:00.000Z	NemesisD		it was working like 2 days ago
2008-08-07T08:40:00.000Z	zelrikriando	NemesisD	what did you do since those 2 days?
2008-08-07T08:41:00.000Z	zelrikriando	NemesisD	what about updates?
2008-08-07T08:41:00.000Z	NemesisD	zelrikriando	when i see an update comes in i just fire up aptitude and upgrade, i don't look though whats in there, but there's definitely been updates the past 2 days
2008-08-07T08:42:00.000Z	zelrikriando	NemesisD	there is an history of the various changes in your synaptic manager
2008-08-07T08:42:00.000Z	zelrikriando	NemesisD	I doubt it can help though
2008-08-07T08:43:00.000Z	zelrikriando	NemesisD	is it hot at your place?
2008-08-07T08:45:00.000Z	zelrikriando	NemesisD	your computer being hot could be a problem..
2008-08-07T08:46:00.000Z	zelrikriando	NemesisD	not sure if it relates to your flash things but flash do make your processor work :p
2008-08-07T08:48:00.000Z	zelrikriando	NemesisD	is midori that good?
2008-08-07T08:48:00.000Z	NemesisD	zelrikriando	blows is a term in america which means its not very good
2008-08-07T08:49:00.000Z	zelrikriando	NemesisD	try epiphany to see if the problem is there too
2008-08-07T08:50:00.000Z	NemesisD	zelrikriando	flash is functional in epiphany as well
2008-08-07T08:50:00.000Z	zelrikriando	NemesisD	actually that reminds me of something, what version of ubuntu/firefox are you using?
2008-08-07T08:52:00.000Z	zelrikriando	NemesisD	you could complain to #firefox@irc.mozilla.org
2008-08-07T08:52:00.000Z	NemesisD	zelrikriando	firefox 3.01, ubuntu hardy
2008-08-07T08:52:00.000Z	zelrikriando	NemesisD	ok
