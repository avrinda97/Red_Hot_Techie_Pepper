2004-11-03T09:22:00.000Z	Gmail	miguel_	ever ones cpu goes at 100%
2004-11-03T09:22:00.000Z	miguel_	Gmail	you say then it's normal?
2004-11-03T09:23:00.000Z	Gmail	miguel_	well for me what ever i do for that second my cpu is 100% but my load is not highish at all
2004-11-03T09:24:00.000Z	Gmail	miguel_	have you ever used linux before?
2004-11-03T09:25:00.000Z	Gmail	miguel_	your load isnt 100%
2004-11-03T09:25:00.000Z	Gmail	miguel_	nor is your load
2004-11-03T09:25:00.000Z	Gmail	miguel_	it just that your cpu is working 100%
2004-11-03T09:25:00.000Z	Gmail	miguel_	you should use the command uptime to see the load
2004-11-03T09:26:00.000Z	Gmail	miguel_	you want your cpu to work 100%
2004-11-03T09:26:00.000Z	Gmail	miguel_	you dont want it to be broken do you?
2004-11-03T09:27:00.000Z	Gmail	miguel_	you should be worried it you are doing some major and it not 100% (unless your compueter is one of the 500 super computers)
