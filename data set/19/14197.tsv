2005-05-23T06:42:00.000Z	Seveas	herzi	have you since november upgraded?
2005-05-23T06:45:00.000Z	herzi	Seveas	no, i don't need OOo
2005-05-23T06:46:00.000Z	Seveas	herzi	do an apt-get -s install ubuntu-desktop and check what you are still missing
2005-05-23T06:48:00.000Z	herzi	Seveas	anacron is to only package i can think of which could be related to that thing
2005-05-23T06:48:00.000Z	Seveas	herzi	waht else isn't installed?
2005-05-23T06:50:00.000Z	herzi	Seveas	/query

2005-05-24T16:52:00.000Z	herzi	Seveas	it works, anacron has been the missing package
2005-05-24T16:52:00.000Z	Seveas	herzi	good to know
2006-12-16T13:02:00.000Z	Seveas	herzi	depends on the bug
2006-12-16T13:03:00.000Z	herzi	Seveas	"Can't use USB drives" (because /dev/sdb is specified as a cd drive)
2006-12-16T13:03:00.000Z	Seveas	herzi	usb drives are not to be put in /etc/fstab
2006-12-16T13:03:00.000Z	herzi	Seveas	right
2006-12-16T13:04:00.000Z	Seveas	herzi	and that entry was created when?
2006-12-16T13:04:00.000Z	herzi	Seveas	install time
2006-12-16T13:05:00.000Z	Seveas	herzi	mention all that in the bug please and file it against the installer (ubiquity is the graphical installer, debian-installer is the command-line one)
2006-12-16T13:05:00.000Z	herzi	Seveas	thank's for your help
