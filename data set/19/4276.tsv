2009-02-14T22:20:00.000Z	marc1453		hello, can someone help a novice with finding Windoze shares and mounting them in Ubuntu?  I want to start using Ubuntu instead of Windows for my system, but all the rest of the computers here run windows and have shared drives I need to access
2009-02-14T22:21:00.000Z	ikonia	marc1453	a good start is calling it "windows" not "windoze"
2009-02-14T22:21:00.000Z	ikonia	marc1453	windoze is not an OS, it's called "windows"
2009-02-14T22:22:00.000Z	ikonia	marc1453	samba will allow that
2009-02-14T22:24:00.000Z	ikonia	marc1453	system menu - then "connect to" menu
2009-02-14T22:24:00.000Z	marc1453	ikonia	I gave that a shot
2009-02-14T22:25:00.000Z	marc1453	ikonia	\\computer\sharename does not appear to work?
2009-02-14T22:25:00.000Z	marc1453	ikonia	I try again
2009-02-14T22:25:00.000Z	ikonia	marc1453	you don't put in \
2009-02-14T22:25:00.000Z	ikonia	marc1453	in the Server put in the server name - not \\servername
2009-02-14T22:25:00.000Z	ikonia	marc1453	in the share nam, put in the share name, not \sharename
2009-02-14T22:27:00.000Z	marc1453	ikonia	the machine is 192.168.0.8 (aka zaphod) and the shared folder is music
2009-02-14T22:27:00.000Z	ikonia	marc1453	so put the server as 192.168.0.8 and the share as music
2009-02-14T22:28:00.000Z	marc1453	ikonia	I know I am doing something worng
2009-02-14T22:28:00.000Z	marc1453	ikonia	1 sec, I try something
2009-02-14T22:29:00.000Z	marc1453	ikonia	think I figured it out... there is no network ;-)
2009-02-14T22:30:00.000Z	marc1453	ikonia	I am using xubuntu.  The network browser must not be installed (xubuntu is the one configured for older hardware, they must have left that one out)
2009-02-14T22:30:00.000Z	ikonia	marc1453	ahhh xubuntu
2009-02-14T22:31:00.000Z	ikonia	marc1453	that makes more sense, I don't know about the xfce layout off the top of my head, but people in #xubuntu will
