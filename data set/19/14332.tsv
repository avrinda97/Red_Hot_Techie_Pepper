2006-01-13T15:13:00.000Z	david_m_e		is there an "anonymous" or "guest" type user that can be activated so that i can log in to my linux box from an WinXp box without having to provide a user name and password?
2006-01-13T15:13:00.000Z	david_m_e		did u see my earlier question?
2006-01-13T15:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	david_m_e	 you could make a 'public' share i belive.. but you will need to learn how to manually edit the samba config.
2006-01-13T15:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	david_m_e	 the 'using samba' book has examples.
2006-01-13T15:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		or just make a guest account.
2006-01-13T15:14:00.000Z	david_m_e		i have an XP computer and a Ubuntu/Samba computer; when on the XP computer, the "computers in this workgroup" shows both computers, but when i try to log on to the linux box from the XP box, i get rejected; when i try the net use command, it seems to try, but the username/password are rejected; where do i set up users to allow them to log in to a Linux box from  another machine (specifically, WinXP)
2006-01-13T15:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		well a account named guest, or somthing :P
2006-01-13T15:15:00.000Z	david_m_e	yatesy	where?
2006-01-13T15:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	david_m_e	 for the users on the linux box to allow windows in.. they must have theur samba password set with 'smbpasswd -a username'  then restart samba
2006-01-13T15:15:00.000Z	david_m_e		thank you Dr Willis
2006-01-13T15:16:00.000Z	david_m_e		restarting samba requires logoff/logon or reboot?
2006-01-13T15:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	david_m_e	 that 'using samba' book has details - and its a free download. :P
2006-01-13T15:16:00.000Z	david_m_e		Dr Willis: i  will try the book again;
2006-01-13T15:16:00.000Z	david_m_e		i DID try the book; i assume u refer to the book on samba.org?
2006-01-13T15:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	david_m_e	 theres a book out called 'using samba' its free for download i recall.. i read it ages ago.. and its  the definitive guide :P lol..
2006-01-13T15:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	david_m_e	 by the time i was through chapter 4 - i knew about all i needed to know.
2006-01-13T15:17:00.000Z	david_m_e		however, this seems to be enuf info; i don't like asking questions without RTM'ng first, but i have been tryhing to figure this out for over a week now
2006-01-13T15:17:00.000Z	david_m_e		all help appreciated
2006-01-13T15:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	david_m_e	 its fairly straight forward. but it depends on exactly what/how you want to do things
