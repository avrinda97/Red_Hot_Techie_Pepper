2005-05-23T16:59:00.000Z	BrianB04		Man, I just installed Hoary, could any Linux distro be any easier?
2005-05-23T05:06:00.000Z	BrianB04		Now, I have my next challenge...figuring out the best way to start encoding CDs to MP3s
2005-05-23T05:08:00.000Z	holycow	BrianB04	i think you got it, ubuntu just goes to show that with a good underpinning (unix) an extremely usable desktop (polished automagic for the unwashed masses) is extremely doable
2005-05-23T05:09:00.000Z	BrianB04	holycow	Yep, and I think with the advent of user friendly Linux distros like Ubuntu, and Mandriva, and Suse, eventually software companies will have to look Linux's way.
2005-05-23T05:09:00.000Z	holycow	BrianB04	little by little, however there is a third phenomenon happening
2005-05-23T05:10:00.000Z	BrianB04	holycow	What's the third phenomenon?
2005-05-23T05:10:00.000Z	holycow	BrianB04	one of the things that i notice is that business really is about cherry picking, there isn't a lot of money to be made by "doing it right, doing it slowly" so ...
2005-05-23T05:11:00.000Z	BrianB04	holycow	That is very true. I mean you can find just about anything out there, including Bail Bond software, which had me worried;)
2005-05-23T05:12:00.000Z	holycow	BrianB04	hehe :)
2005-05-23T05:12:00.000Z	BrianB04	holycow	Talk about a vertical product, that's a pain to find.
2005-05-23T05:15:00.000Z	holycow	BrianB04	having the drivers included is kinda nifty *nod*
2005-05-23T05:20:00.000Z	BrianB04	holycow	Wow, Gimp has matured a lot since I last played with it...
2005-05-23T05:22:00.000Z	holycow	BrianB04	i just finished two commercial projects with it
2005-05-23T06:26:00.000Z	holycow	BrianB04	what features are you looking for?
2005-05-23T06:26:00.000Z	BrianB04	holycow	Nice tagging, ability to move files within the program, and have it update automatically.
2005-05-23T06:29:00.000Z	BrianB04	holycow	And the ability to lookup and retag MP3s based on the CDDB would be nice too.
2005-05-23T06:29:00.000Z	holycow	BrianB04	not sure of a tool that does all that
2005-05-23T06:36:00.000Z	holycow	BrianB04	yeah a lot of comments have been made about gnome and kde splitting up the destkop environment but ...
2005-05-23T06:39:00.000Z	holycow	BrianB04	welcome :)
