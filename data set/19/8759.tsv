2007-04-21T15:55:00.000Z	aatdark		Q: why is there no flashplayer for x64 avaliable =
2007-04-21T15:55:00.000Z	Agrajag	aatdark	because Adobe has not released one.
2007-04-21T15:55:00.000Z	aatdark	Agrajag	is there any chanceh that there will be one ?
2007-04-21T15:55:00.000Z	Agrajag	aatdark	I doubt it.
2007-04-21T15:56:00.000Z	aatdark	Agrajag	is there a tecnical problem ?
2007-04-21T15:56:00.000Z	Agrajag	aatdark	I don't know.
2007-04-21T15:56:00.000Z	aatdark	Agrajag	i think im going to write these heliox guys
2007-04-21T15:56:00.000Z	Agrajag	aatdark	Since the plugin is closed-source, there's nothing much that can be done besdies writing to Adobe and asking for an AMD64 port
2007-04-21T15:57:00.000Z	Agrajag	aatdark	you can, however, run a 32-bit browser, and thus 32-bit plugins, in a 64-bit OS
2007-04-21T15:57:00.000Z	aatdark	Agrajag	but isn't there an opensource port from the suse guys ?
2007-04-21T15:57:00.000Z	Agrajag	aatdark	no idea, I don't have to deal with it so I haven't paid attention
2007-04-21T15:57:00.000Z	aatdark	Agrajag	that a good idee ,but how can i install an x86 browser with apt ?
2007-04-21T15:58:00.000Z	Agrajag	aatdark	there's a couple different ways. Back when I tried using a 64-bit OS I used a chroot and loaded a 32-bit userland there, the entire OS. I'd suggest looking on the forums for HOWTOs on this stuff
2007-04-21T15:59:00.000Z	aatdark	Agrajag	sounds like a lot of space
2007-04-21T15:59:00.000Z	aatdark	Agrajag	but i think there is an prog called setarch ..
2007-04-21T15:59:00.000Z	aatdark	Agrajag	i will try
2007-04-21T15:59:00.000Z	Agrajag	aatdark	not really, a few hundred megs out of a few hundred gigs
2007-04-21T15:59:00.000Z	Agrajag	aatdark	however you end up doing it, running a 32-bit browser will allow you to use Adobe Flash.
2007-04-21T16:00:00.000Z	aatdark	Agrajag	thx
