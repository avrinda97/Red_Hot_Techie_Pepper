2008-07-25T16:04:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	wols	oh sorry i didnt know that ...
2008-07-25T16:04:00.000Z	wols	arvind_khadri	usually it means a dependency mentions it but there is no such package
2008-07-25T16:05:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	wols	oh i used to feel that it meant that it had a different installation candidate ...
2008-07-25T16:06:00.000Z	wols	arvind_khadri	it never did
2008-07-25T16:06:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	wols	ohh .. thanks for the information
2008-08-22T17:36:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	wols	i have a hp all in one.. deskjet f2200 series... i am unable to install it using hp-setup
2008-08-22T17:36:00.000Z	wols	arvind_khadri	linuxprinting.org especially
2008-08-22T17:36:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	wols	ok :)
2008-08-22T17:40:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	wols	doesn't help... i have a all in one
2008-08-22T17:40:00.000Z	wols	arvind_khadri	huh? there is no "all in one"
2008-08-22T17:41:00.000Z	wols	arvind_khadri	just cause it'S a printer and scanner in one case still means ubuntu sees it as two devices. one printer like any other, one scanner like any ohter
2008-08-22T17:41:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	wols	in the linuxprinting thingy its not there...in our community docs its there...i did everything but it doesnt help...
2008-08-22T17:43:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	wols	scanning doesnt happen... when i run sudo hp-setup , the printer isnt found...if i enter the usb id manually then too it says cant find...
2008-08-22T17:44:00.000Z	wols	arvind_khadri	scanning is the domain of sane-project
2008-08-22T17:44:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	wols	so you want me to ask #sane?
2008-08-22T17:44:00.000Z	wols	arvind_khadri	for the scanner part I want you to check their website
2008-08-22T17:45:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	wols	ok...
2008-08-22T17:45:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	wols	the printer works fine anyways
