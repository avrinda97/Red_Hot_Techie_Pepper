2007-08-16T12:36:00.000Z	PaulEU		hello!
2007-08-16T12:36:00.000Z	PaulEU		where can I submit bug in gedit2 ?
2007-08-16T12:37:00.000Z	PaulEU		when I unselected wrap lines - some very long lines has strange characters..
2007-08-16T12:37:00.000Z	wolferine	PaulEU	can you recreate it?
2007-08-16T12:38:00.000Z	PaulEU	wolferine	Yes, I do create screenshot
2007-08-16T12:38:00.000Z	wolferine	PaulEU	showing me it will do nothing
2007-08-16T12:39:00.000Z	PaulEU	wolferine	how can I show you ?
2007-08-16T12:39:00.000Z	wolferine	PaulEU	i have nothing to do with gedit
2007-08-16T12:40:00.000Z	PaulEU	wolferine	who is interested with it? ;)
2007-08-16T12:40:00.000Z	PaulEU	wolferine	is there any developer of ubuntu?
2007-08-16T12:40:00.000Z	wolferine	PaulEU	the creators, which you can probably find in help
2007-08-16T12:40:00.000Z	PaulEU	wolferine	ok, thx :)
2007-08-16T12:41:00.000Z	wolferine	PaulEU	my point was, once the error happened once, no point in submitting it, if you can recreate, then you might have something
2007-08-16T12:41:00.000Z	PaulEU	wolferine	first I'll try contact with autors of gedit2
2007-08-16T12:41:00.000Z	wolferine	PaulEU	if you can recreate, then they might want to hear from you
2007-08-16T12:42:00.000Z	PaulEU	wolferine	I know
2007-08-16T12:42:00.000Z	PaulEU	wolferine	thx for help
2007-08-16T12:42:00.000Z	wolferine	PaulEU	also, you may want to run it from command line, which will offer some output
2007-08-16T12:42:00.000Z	PaulEU	wolferine	ok
