2012-04-06T15:39:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	karan4	ok, now try running "sudo rfkill unblock all" it should work now that acer_wmi is blacklisted
2012-04-06T15:33:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	karan4	hello. could you please tell me if anything shows up when running "lsmod | grep acer_wmi" on your ubuntu machine?
2012-04-06T15:40:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	karan4	did the output of "rfkill list" change?
2012-04-06T15:41:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	karan4	did you get any errors when running unblock?
2012-04-06T15:42:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	karan4	can you check if you are still getting that weird airplane mode behaviour?
2012-04-06T15:46:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	karan4	can you post the output of "ifconfig"?
2012-04-06T15:51:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	karan4	thanks
2012-04-06T15:53:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	karan4	try "sudo ifup wlan0"
2012-04-06T15:57:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	karan4	just a sec, looking up a command
2012-04-06T15:58:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	karan4	ok, try "sudo ifup -a"
2012-04-06T15:59:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	karan4	then run "ifconfig" again and see if any new entries (other than lo and eth0) appear
2012-04-06T16:06:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	karan4	I cannot think of any other troubleshooting ideas for your problem. I recommend opening a bug report (as it appears to be a bug) and linking it to https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-nettool/+question/175340 and mention that you are the second person with the same wireless card to have this problem
2012-04-06T16:07:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	karan4	add as much detail as possible, and make sure to mention the airplane mode issue
