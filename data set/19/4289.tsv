2009-07-12T14:21:00.000Z	gribouille		hi
2009-07-12T14:22:00.000Z	gribouille		I've installed firefox 3.5 and it really sux
2009-07-12T14:24:00.000Z	mzz	gribouille	is the problem with fonts?
2009-07-12T14:24:00.000Z	gribouille	mzz	no
2009-07-12T14:25:00.000Z	mzz	gribouille	ok, then I'll just wait for the screenshot :)
2009-07-12T14:34:00.000Z	mzz	gribouille	I saw, sorry, was multitasking. Renders just fine in 3.5 here. Does it work in firefox safe mode (exit it completely and use "firefox-3.5 -safe-mode" to start it again) or in a temporary fresh profile?
2009-07-12T14:35:00.000Z	mzz	gribouille	wait, grawity has a point. You *are* complaining about the content, not the firefox interface?
2009-07-12T14:35:00.000Z	gribouille	mzz	let's try it
2009-07-12T14:37:00.000Z	gribouille	mzz	what do you mean ?
2009-07-12T14:37:00.000Z	gribouille	mzz	I'm complaining about the way firefox diplays a page
2009-07-12T14:37:00.000Z	mzz	gribouille	you're in kde, and getting the stock gtk theme, so the firefox user interface looks a bit clunky.
2009-07-12T14:38:00.000Z	gribouille	mzz	the problem is not the interface
2009-07-12T14:40:00.000Z	gribouille	mzz	don't you see the thick black lines on the screenshot ?
2009-07-12T14:40:00.000Z	mzz	gribouille	yes, but mainly you're getting a completely different page style than I'm getting here.
2009-07-12T14:40:00.000Z	gribouille	mzz	what do you mean by page style ?
2009-07-12T14:40:00.000Z	mzz	gribouille	err, no, wait. I didn't scroll down far enough.
2009-07-12T14:42:00.000Z	mzz	gribouille	huh, not sure what's going on there :(
2009-07-12T14:42:00.000Z	mzz	gribouille	(unless it's some pretty weird cairo/driver interaction)
2009-07-12T14:42:00.000Z	mzz	gribouille	I've seen vaguely similar corruption but only on very tall pages
