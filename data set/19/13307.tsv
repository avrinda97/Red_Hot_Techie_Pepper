2005-04-19T09:42:00.000Z	Epicenter		Hello, I was wondering perhaps someone could help me out with something? ...
2005-04-19T09:42:00.000Z	Epicenter		I got this new Hedgehog 5.something build of Kubuntu and when I try to run the i386 or AMD64 liveCDs I get 2 distint problems.
2005-04-19T09:42:00.000Z	Epicenter		On the AMD64 one, the system stops responding at trying to read the hardware clock
2005-04-19T09:43:00.000Z	Epicenter		I read a thread about it and saw no fix
2005-04-19T09:43:00.000Z	Epicenter		On the i386 front, X comes up and it's all vertical colored lines. I can move the mouse and see different corruption or kill X but no output appears and I can't find the problem.
2005-04-19T09:43:00.000Z	Epicenter		None of this happens in Debian.
2005-04-19T09:45:00.000Z	Epicenter		I cannot explain any of this at all .. everyone else seems to just grab the CDs and run with it. No such luck for me.
2005-04-19T09:47:00.000Z	Epicenter		can no one help me?
2005-04-19T09:47:00.000Z	Epicenter		No one even replies, or says hello, here, #kubuntu, or the forums :(
2005-04-19T09:47:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Epicenter	what's wrong ?
2005-04-19T09:49:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Epicenter	for the X problem I would try the vesa driver for your video card. It ususally works on most video cards (not very well tho)
2005-04-19T09:49:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Epicenter	your using the warty live cd ?
2005-04-19T09:51:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Epicenter	change your video driver to vesa in /etc/X11/Xorg.conf and try starting X again
2005-04-19T09:51:00.000Z	Epicenter	LinuxJones	this is going to be in the ramdisk? I can edit it?
2005-04-19T09:51:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Epicenter	your i386 is a live cd ?
2005-04-19T09:52:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Epicenter	just do an install dude it's easier to fix that way and only takes about 25 mins
2005-04-19T10:17:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Epicenter	are there any options under the help option in the Live CD. That sounds like something that could be done as a commandline option @ boot
2005-04-19T10:28:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Epicenter	it was slashdotted today
2005-04-19T10:40:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Epicenter	there is none use sudo -s in console
