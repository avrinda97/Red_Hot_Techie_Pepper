2005-10-03T13:51:00.000Z	deFrysk	marco_g	using backports and having probs with firefox ?
2005-10-03T13:51:00.000Z	marco_g	deFrysk	I did a dist-upgrade from hoary to breezy and firefox doesn't start anymore.
2005-10-03T13:52:00.000Z	deFrysk	marco_g	apt-get remove --purge mozilla-firefox is the solution I think
2005-10-03T13:52:00.000Z	deFrysk	marco_g	and get rid of those backports!
2005-10-03T13:53:00.000Z	marco_g	deFrysk	I never used backports...
2005-10-03T13:53:00.000Z	deFrysk	marco_g	and then reinstall mozilla-firefox
2005-10-03T13:53:00.000Z	deFrysk	marco_g	strange that it does not work then
2005-10-03T13:54:00.000Z	marco_g	deFrysk	I agree.
2005-10-03T13:54:00.000Z	marco_g	deFrysk	Purging didn't work for me.
2005-10-03T13:55:00.000Z	deFrysk	marco_g	remove the .mozillafolder perhaps that works
2005-10-03T13:55:00.000Z	marco_g	deFrysk	That was the first thing I tried.
2005-10-03T13:56:00.000Z	marco_g	deFrysk	A new .mozilla directory is created, but it exits and the .mozilla dir is left empty.
2005-10-03T13:57:00.000Z	deFrysk	marco_g	sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop (in case something is missing)
2005-10-03T13:58:00.000Z	marco_g	deFrysk	I did that too...
2005-10-03T13:59:00.000Z	deFrysk	marco_g	sorry I am at a loss
2005-10-03T13:59:00.000Z	marco_g	deFrysk	Thanks anyways. :)
2005-10-03T13:59:00.000Z	deFrysk	marco_g	good luck
