2009-01-30T02:17:00.000Z	subsume		Can I install jaunty app for mysql-server-5.1 in intrepid?
2009-01-30T02:18:00.000Z	ikonia	subsume	no
2009-01-30T02:18:00.000Z	ikonia	subsume	don't mix packages for ubuntu versions
2009-01-30T02:19:00.000Z	ikonia	subsume	why ? what's in 5.1 that you need
2009-01-30T02:19:00.000Z	subsume	ikonia	there's a bug in 5.0 that's causing me hell and its fixed in 5.1
2009-01-30T02:19:00.000Z	ikonia	subsume	which bug ?
2009-01-30T02:20:00.000Z	subsume	ikonia	causes random InterfaceError
2009-01-30T02:21:00.000Z	ikonia	subsume	log bug against the mysql package to get the bug fix back ported
2009-01-30T02:22:00.000Z	subsume	ikonia	I'm sorry?
2009-01-30T02:22:00.000Z	ikonia	subsume	if you log a but on launchpad.net against the mysql package the bug fix you want will be back ported to 8.10
2009-01-30T02:22:00.000Z	subsume	ikonia	hmmmmmmm that would be awesome.
2009-01-30T02:23:00.000Z	subsume	ikonia	but that will probably take weeks, eh?
2009-01-30T02:23:00.000Z	ikonia	subsume	speak to the package maintainer, it can be turned around quite quick
2009-01-30T02:23:00.000Z	subsume	ikonia	awesome. you're a big help.
2009-01-30T02:23:00.000Z	ikonia	subsume	not a problem
2009-01-30T02:25:00.000Z	subsume	ikonia	what am I doing wrong? https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+search?text=mysql-server&start=75&batch=75
2009-01-30T02:25:00.000Z	ikonia	subsume	you need to log a new bug
2009-01-30T02:25:00.000Z	ikonia	subsume	have you created an account yet ?
