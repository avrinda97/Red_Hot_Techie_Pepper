2007-02-23T13:33:00.000Z	sparr	dthorenj	adjust your monitor
2007-02-23T13:45:00.000Z	sparr	dthorenj	because your monitor is broken
2007-02-23T13:46:00.000Z	sparr	dthorenj	then use 800x600
2007-02-23T13:46:00.000Z	sparr	dthorenj	then buy a working monitor
2007-02-23T13:46:00.000Z	sparr	dthorenj	well, youre wrong.  have you considered changing the refresh rate?
2007-02-23T13:47:00.000Z	dthorenj	sparr	it wont let me change the refresh rate
2007-02-23T13:47:00.000Z	sparr	dthorenj	"it"?
2007-02-23T13:48:00.000Z	dthorenj	sparr	how would i go about changing the resolution somewhere else?
2007-02-23T13:48:00.000Z	sparr	dthorenj	edit your X config, and im dont helping.
