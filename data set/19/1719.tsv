2010-10-20T17:48:00.000Z	c1arc		tried all bunch of stuff: un-installed all the nvidia stuf there was, removerd any nvidia ko,o files etc
2010-10-20T17:48:00.000Z	c1arc		reinstalled nvidia-173
2010-10-20T17:48:00.000Z	c1arc		ran nvidia-xconfig
2010-10-20T17:49:00.000Z	c1arc		and ran nvidia settings
2010-10-20T17:51:00.000Z	c1arc		AGP-V8200 T2-T5 GeForce-3
2010-10-20T17:52:00.000Z	c1arc		I think nvidia-173 and Geforce-3 are compatible

2010-10-20T17:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	c1arc	what is the output of:  lsb_release -c    ,thanks
2010-10-20T17:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	c1arc	can you give the output of:  lspci | grep -i vga    thanks
2010-10-20T18:04:00.000Z	c1arc	ActionParsnip	any further ideas?
2010-10-20T18:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	c1arc	you may need an xorg.conf to make it nice
2010-10-20T18:05:00.000Z	c1arc	ActionParsnip	I have one and tried various things to it, no luck
2010-10-20T18:06:00.000Z	c1arc	ActionParsnip	created it several times using nvidia-xconfig
2010-10-20T18:08:00.000Z	c1arc	ActionParsnip	thanks for your time
2010-10-20T23:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	c1arc	remove all the nvidia drivers and you will use nv or nouveau driver which supports your chip
2010-10-20T23:32:00.000Z	c1arc	ActionParsnip	will it support all the  resolutions etc?
2010-10-20T23:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	c1arc	sure
