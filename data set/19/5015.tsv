2008-11-10T12:02:00.000Z	locainex		remove the directory nibsa1242?
2008-11-10T12:02:00.000Z	locainex		this a new user?
2008-11-10T12:02:00.000Z	locainex		or just add the user and link the /home dir later
2008-11-10T12:02:00.000Z	nibsa1242	locainex	no, its from my old install... just did a clean install but kept the /home partition
2008-11-10T12:03:00.000Z	locainex	nibsa1242	you picked a new username and want to reassociate it with an old home dir?
2008-11-10T12:04:00.000Z	nibsa1242	locainex	no, I have about 4 users on this machine... they all have directories in /home and need user accounts so they can log in
2008-11-10T12:05:00.000Z	nibsa1242	locainex	but the admin->users and groups gets annoyed because their home directories already exist
2008-11-10T12:06:00.000Z	locainex		thought there was something for that in the installer now nibsa1242 :/ but maybe it doesnt work right
2008-11-10T12:06:00.000Z	locainex		hm
2008-11-10T12:07:00.000Z	locainex		well nibsa1242 you tried to manually create the users on the commandline, without giving them a home dir
2008-11-10T12:07:00.000Z	locainex		you can add that in later in the gui
2008-11-10T12:07:00.000Z	locainex		easiest way i can think of to fix it
2008-11-10T12:07:00.000Z	nibsa1242	locainex	I just installed and it didn't ask me anything or set them up properly... I installed from live cd... perhaps alternate had options. I normally do alternate, seems to be more configurable.
2008-11-10T12:07:00.000Z	locainex		or work around it
2008-11-10T12:07:00.000Z	locainex		yeah ive done a few installs and its only asked to import a fraction of those times
2008-11-10T12:07:00.000Z	nibsa1242	locainex	no I'll try that, I've never created a user that way before, so I was afraid to do that.
2008-11-10T12:08:00.000Z	locainex		theres good steps on the forums nibsa1242
2008-11-10T12:08:00.000Z	nibsa1242	locainex	alright... thanks I'll go look
