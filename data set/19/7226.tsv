2008-01-16T02:38:00.000Z	fx|RabBit		what do you folks watch tv with on ubuntu?
2008-01-16T02:38:00.000Z	pike_	fx|RabBit	i use a regular torrent client but you may like miro
2008-01-16T02:38:00.000Z	pike_	fx|RabBit	miro + tvrss.net is pretty cool like a dvr for your comp
2008-01-16T02:39:00.000Z	fx|RabBit	pike_	 umm i really meant tv, like using a tv-card?
2008-01-16T02:39:00.000Z	pike_	fx|RabBit	ive used vlc to test capture cards but other than that not sure
2008-01-16T02:40:00.000Z	fx|RabBit	pike_	vlc???
2008-01-16T02:41:00.000Z	pike_	fx|RabBit	video lan client
2008-01-16T02:42:00.000Z	fx|RabBit	pike_	i know what that is  but i think you are talking about watching some video files and i am talking abeot watching that television buddy;)
2008-01-16T02:42:00.000Z	pike_	fx|RabBit	nope vlc is pretty handy since yoiu can specify capture sources and stream em to remote machines etc
2008-01-16T02:42:00.000Z	pike_	fx|RabBit	its the easiest tool to test the capture cards initially imo
2008-01-16T02:42:00.000Z	fx|RabBit	pike_	 and you can stream from a tv-adapter with vlc????
2008-01-16T02:43:00.000Z	pike_	fx|RabBit	yeah
2008-01-16T02:43:00.000Z	fx|RabBit	pike_	 i havent heard of that, thats kinda surprse to me ill test it rioght away
2008-01-16T02:43:00.000Z	fx|RabBit	pike_	 does that come along with the standard vlc client or do i need any plugins?
2008-01-16T02:44:00.000Z	pike_	fx|RabBit	no its the standard app
2008-01-16T02:45:00.000Z	fx|RabBit	pike_	 can i have a talk in a query pls?
2008-01-16T02:45:00.000Z	pike_	fx|RabBit	you can msg me but im at work so  it may take me a while to respond
2008-01-16T02:48:00.000Z	fx|RabBit	pike_	 ok thanx, see query for further puzzles gg
