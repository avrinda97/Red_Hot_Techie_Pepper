2012-04-05T21:02:00.000Z	scarykitties		i'm having some trouble attempting to install Ubuntu for the first time.
2012-04-05T21:03:00.000Z	scarykitties		Basically, I've tried multiple times to burn ubuntu to a DVD+R (from an ISO gotten from the torrent available on the Ubuntu website for desktop 32-bit of the latest version) and it verifies fine, but when I try to verify the disk on an installing computer, I always get "Error found in 1 files"
2012-04-05T21:03:00.000Z	scarykitties		No, compdoc; I want a fresh install.
2012-04-05T21:04:00.000Z	scarykitties		It doesn't say
2012-04-05T21:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	scarykitties	tried a different CD brand? Are you burning as slowly as possible?
2012-04-05T21:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	scarykitties	tried USB?
2012-04-05T21:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	scarykitties	you will need the DVD ISO to burn to DVD

2012-04-05T21:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	scarykitties	you can use PAE and access up to 64Gb in 43bit OS
2012-04-05T21:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	scarykitties	just use the OS, as you play you will learn
2012-04-05T21:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	scarykitties	it is for the most part
2012-04-05T21:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	scarykitties	software centre is for installing apps, in the past it was synaptic
2012-04-05T21:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	scarykitties	eactly, thats why I use Linux
