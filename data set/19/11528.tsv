2006-05-27T06:31:00.000Z	sonasks		i tried growisofs, mkudffs
2006-05-27T06:31:00.000Z	sonasks		went through all the forum
2006-05-27T06:32:00.000Z	sonasks		can i directly burn to a dvd via dvdrecord/cdrecord ??
2006-05-27T06:32:00.000Z	sonasks		without making the image first ?
2006-05-27T06:33:00.000Z	sonasks		not even mentioning that every time i execute something on a drive, it takes ages
2006-05-27T06:33:00.000Z	sonasks		and this smiley red led won`t even blink
2006-05-27T06:33:00.000Z	sonasks		of course CD works fine
2006-05-27T06:33:00.000Z	sonasks		reading the dvd works fine too
2006-05-27T06:34:00.000Z	sonasks		but when it comes to dvd... ehh... - some 2GB limitations of files, even in UDF - i don`t know how this is possible
2006-05-27T06:34:00.000Z	sonasks		UDF IS for big files, isn`t it ??
2006-05-27T06:34:00.000Z	arcade	sonasks	huh?
2006-05-27T06:35:00.000Z	arcade	sonasks	Calm down and we can probably figure things out for you. :)
2006-05-27T06:35:00.000Z	arcade	sonasks	First off, do you want to be able to do this graphically or from the command line?
2006-05-27T06:35:00.000Z	arcade	sonasks	And, is it the creation of the image that fails, or the burning of the image to the dvd-rom?
2006-05-27T06:36:00.000Z	arcade	sonasks	Okay, how do you attempt to create the image?
2006-05-27T06:37:00.000Z	arcade	sonasks	Not interested in that.  Interested in the command.
2006-05-27T06:37:00.000Z	arcade	sonasks	Begin with the command for creating the image.
2006-05-27T06:38:00.000Z	arcade	sonasks	sounds like a very wrong command, if /dev/hdc is your dvd-drive.
2006-05-27T06:40:00.000Z	arcade	sonasks	I usually create the .iso first, then burn.
