2011-02-15T07:04:00.000Z	_pg_		!multijava usage help
2011-02-15T07:05:00.000Z	jrib	_pg_	what is your question?
2011-02-15T07:05:00.000Z	_pg_	jrib	do i have to set the default for each thing? --jre --jre headless --plugin etc
2011-02-15T07:06:00.000Z	jrib	_pg_	no that's the point of update-java-alternatives
2011-02-15T07:06:00.000Z	_pg_	jrib	i cant figure out how to tell what the default is for each thing
2011-02-15T07:06:00.000Z	_pg_		or at all
2011-02-15T07:07:00.000Z	jrib	_pg_	if you don't pass --jre-headless or --jre or --plugin, I believe it just sets everything
2011-02-15T07:07:00.000Z	_pg_		how do i know what is set?
2011-02-15T07:08:00.000Z	jrib	_pg_	don't know
2011-02-15T07:08:00.000Z	_pg_	jrib	most of the options dont seem to do anything
2011-02-15T07:09:00.000Z	jrib	_pg_	use update-java-alternatives -s YOUR_CHOICE
2011-02-15T07:09:00.000Z	_pg_		whats the format for your choice?
2011-02-15T07:09:00.000Z	_pg_		i tried java-6-sun 63
2011-02-15T07:09:00.000Z	jrib	_pg_	update-java-alternatives -l  lists your choices
2011-02-15T07:09:00.000Z	jrib	_pg_	drop the "63"
2011-02-15T07:10:00.000Z	_pg_		i get all this output that it doesnt exist
2011-02-15T07:13:00.000Z	jrib	_pg_	that's because you don't have the jdk.  Pass the --jre option if you want
2011-02-15T07:14:00.000Z	_pg_	jrib	:]
2011-02-15T07:15:00.000Z	_pg_	jrib	nice call with the --jre. totally made the magic happened
