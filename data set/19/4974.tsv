2009-10-25T11:54:00.000Z	madsj		what's the terminal command for upgrading the distribution ?
2009-10-25T11:56:00.000Z	dracnoc	madsj	sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
2009-10-25T11:57:00.000Z	madsj	dracnoc	thanks :-) I was looking for a "dist-upgrade"-command
2009-10-25T12:09:00.000Z	madsj	dracnoc	it only a few packages to upgrade;
2009-10-25T12:09:00.000Z	madsj		and the kernel is not 2.6.31
2009-10-25T12:10:00.000Z	dracnoc	madsj	then it shouldn't take too long to do :)
2009-10-25T12:11:00.000Z	madsj	dracnoc	yeah :-) but it seems that it didn't upgrade the things it was supposed to
2009-10-25T12:13:00.000Z	dracnoc	madsj	have you got all the repositories selected? Use "Software Sources" in your Admin menu and check.
2009-10-25T12:33:00.000Z	madsj	dracnoc	I'm running it from the commandline
2009-10-25T12:34:00.000Z	dracnoc	madsj	how many files is it trying to upgrade?
2009-10-25T12:34:00.000Z	madsj	dracnoc	7
2009-10-25T12:35:00.000Z	dracnoc	madsj	what are they?
2009-10-25T12:36:00.000Z	madsj	dracnoc	I upgraded them, but it should be a log somewhere
2009-10-25T12:37:00.000Z	dracnoc	madsj	/var/log/dist-upgrade?
2009-10-25T12:40:00.000Z	madsj	dracnoc	ubuntu-minimal, friendly-recovery, system-services upstart-logd and startup-tasks were removed, and sysvinit was installed
2009-10-25T12:42:00.000Z	dracnoc	madsj	so, what exactly is your problem? Did the dist-upgrade work? Your computer isn't going to remove things it needs, and it will only upgrade what can be upgraded. Do you also need to run "sudo apt-get upgrade"?
2009-10-25T12:44:00.000Z	madsj	dracnoc	don't know; maybe I should try with the GUI-tool instead
2009-10-25T12:44:00.000Z	madsj		clea
2009-10-25T12:47:00.000Z	dracnoc	madsj	if you think that some software should be updated and it isn't, then you need to check if you have all your repositories enabled. Like I said earlier, you can use  "Software Sources" in your Admin menu, or you can edit the sources file directly - /etc/apt/sources.list
