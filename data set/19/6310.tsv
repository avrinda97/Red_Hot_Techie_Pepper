2008-03-07T17:09:00.000Z	marco	rhineheart_m	have you installed apache, and php?
2008-03-07T17:09:00.000Z	rhineheart_m	marco	yeah.. I do have
2008-03-07T17:17:00.000Z	rhineheart_m	marco	yes marco?
2008-03-07T17:17:00.000Z	rhineheart_m	marco	found something?
2008-03-07T17:18:00.000Z	marco	rhineheart_m	just extract the archive from http://phpsysinfo.sourceforge.net/ and put in your htdocs folder. Run apache and point your browser to localhost
2008-03-07T17:20:00.000Z	marco	rhineheart_m	I just finished installing it locally on my laptop. Was a pretty easy setup once you edit the config.php file.
2008-03-07T17:23:00.000Z	rhineheart_m	marco	I got here.. Bad file descriptor. Failed to write..
2008-03-07T17:23:00.000Z	marco	rhineheart_m	did you download the RC or Current Release?
2008-03-07T17:24:00.000Z	rhineheart_m	marco	phpSysInfo 2.5.4
2008-03-07T17:24:00.000Z	marco	rhineheart_m	I didn't have any trouble with extraction. Are you using CommandLine or an archive program?
2008-03-07T17:29:00.000Z	rhineheart_m	marco	okay.. I got it working.. but do you think this is safe?
2008-03-07T17:30:00.000Z	marco	rhineheart_m	Not sure to be completely honest. My webserver on my laptop is localhost only I use it for development only. So far the script looks pretty clean - I don't see any harm in making it public.
2008-03-07T17:31:00.000Z	rhineheart_m	marco	thanks... have you checked the files already if it is really clean?
2008-03-07T17:31:00.000Z	marco	rhineheart_m	I scanned through the main function files. The ones that do all the calls. Dosn't seem like anything is malicious. Plus this is included in the Package Manager. Meaning Ubuntu team have already looked through and approved it.
2008-03-07T17:32:00.000Z	rhineheart_m	marco	ah.. really? okay.. thanks...
2008-03-07T17:32:00.000Z	marco	rhineheart_m	No problem.
2008-03-07T17:33:00.000Z	rhineheart_m	marco	can you please check this one for me? http://gentoox.shallax.com/
2008-03-07T17:34:00.000Z	rhineheart_m	marco	have you seen the module int eh left side of the page.. do you know what is it?
2008-03-07T18:07:00.000Z	rhineheart_m	marco	Is there a way to remove the local IP there?
