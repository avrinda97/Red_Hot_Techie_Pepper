2006-12-03T17:58:00.000Z	reverseblade		how can I prevent my users to delete a directory itself, but they should be able to create files within ?
2006-12-03T06:50:00.000Z	reverseblade		How do I enable ACL ?
2006-12-03T06:51:00.000Z	Vorbote	reverseblade	it depends on your filesystem.
2006-12-03T06:51:00.000Z	reverseblade	Vorbote	since this is #ubuntu , what file system I could be using ?
2006-12-03T06:52:00.000Z	Vorbote	reverseblade	that's a combination of religigous belief and personal experience. But as DARKGuy points out (erroneusly to me, btw) ext3 is the default in Debian and derivatives.
2006-12-03T06:53:00.000Z	reverseblade	Vorbote	you are very helpful, in deed
2006-12-03T06:53:00.000Z	Vorbote	reverseblade	in the case of ext2/3/4 you use tune2fs to enable ACLs in the filesystem.
2006-12-03T06:53:00.000Z	reverseblade		alright
2006-12-03T06:53:00.000Z	reverseblade	Vorbote	I have just installed a package called ACL
2006-12-03T06:54:00.000Z	Vorbote	reverseblade	yes, you need the userspace tools to be able to manipulate ACLs in the filesystem
2006-12-03T06:55:00.000Z	reverseblade		alright, one more thing Vorbote , is it worth enough to deal ? do you think it is stable ? and why it is not enabled by default in gnu linux? or will it be in the future ?
2006-12-03T06:57:00.000Z	Vorbote	reverseblade	it is very stable. Particularly in the case of extX because that was the first file system where ACLs were implemented. (XFS was the second; reiserfs is a hack, JFS is very recent but works nicely). The reason is is not enabled by default is perhaps historic; ACLs are used in massive multi-user setups mostly and that was the domain of Solaris and AIX in the past.
2006-12-03T06:57:00.000Z	reverseblade	Vorbote	and for the future , what is your expectations ?
2006-12-03T06:58:00.000Z	Vorbote	reverseblade	Linux multi-user servers will rule ;-)
2006-12-03T06:58:00.000Z	reverseblade	Vorbote	I meant about the availability of ACL by default ?
2006-12-03T06:59:00.000Z	reverseblade	Vorbote	I am just curious, if we could see ACL as the de facto standard
2006-12-03T07:00:00.000Z	Vorbote	reverseblade	that's always a prerogative of the sysadmin. If you like me, are a BOfH or former one, you will enabled them first thing in the list. But to enable them by efault? Hmm... I think the traditional POSIX scheme works well enough, unless you have to interoperate with SMB/CIFS filesystems (namely WinNT/Samba).
2006-12-03T07:01:00.000Z	reverseblade	Vorbote	I got it, thanks
2006-12-03T07:01:00.000Z	Vorbote	reverseblade	your welcome
