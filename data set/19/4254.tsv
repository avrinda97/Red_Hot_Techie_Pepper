2009-03-01T22:01:00.000Z	Cyclist		Hello, again! has anyone of you ever had a problem with your CD drive not playing a music CD? the hardware is OK [I am sure of it], but the media player only returns the message ''not playing''
2009-03-01T22:02:00.000Z	ortsvorsteher	Cyclist	the cd is mounted? can you read the files on the cd? which format do they have?
2009-03-01T22:03:00.000Z	Cyclist	ortsvorsteher	I do not know whether it is mounted or not
2009-03-01T22:04:00.000Z	Cyclist		i inserted the CD and the media player started, then stoped...
2009-03-01T22:04:00.000Z	ortsvorsteher	Cyclist	insert the cd in drive, close it. open a terminal and type there "mount"
2009-03-01T22:04:00.000Z	Cyclist		ok
2009-03-01T22:06:00.000Z	Cyclist	ortsvorsteher	I assumed that the CD drive would have been ''mounted'' when the system acknwoledged its existence by opening the media player...
2009-03-01T22:07:00.000Z	Cyclist	ortsvorsteher	it is a music CD
2009-03-01T22:07:00.000Z	ortsvorsteher	Cyclist	yes, i think you are right. may you can open nautilus to look which files are on the cd
2009-03-01T22:08:00.000Z	ortsvorsteher	Cyclist	are there files on the cd like .ogg? or mp3?
2009-03-01T22:08:00.000Z	Cyclist		ortsvorsteher:funny thing about that; the CD files should come up as .cda [I think] but in the Nautilus they are identified as .wma
2009-03-01T22:09:00.000Z	ortsvorsteher	Cyclist	are you familiar with commandline?
2009-03-01T22:09:00.000Z	Cyclist	ortsvorsteher	no, not really...
2009-03-01T22:10:00.000Z	ortsvorsteher	Cyclist	no problem. may you open a terminal. type there "mount" please. look where youre cd is mounted
2009-03-01T22:12:00.000Z	Cyclist	ortsvorsteher	ok, but that try will have to be postponed until tomorrow, as I cannot restart my pc now [I have a dual-boot system and am using the WinXP OS at the moment...]
2009-03-01T22:13:00.000Z	Cyclist	ortsvorsteher	is that all I need to type: ''mount''?
2009-03-01T22:14:00.000Z	ortsvorsteher	Cyclist	okay. so come back when you need. no, not at all. mount shows you where the cd is mounted. cd to location of the cd. after you listed the files, you can look which format they are with "file music.wma"
2009-03-01T22:17:00.000Z	Cyclist	ortsvorsteher	thank you; I will be here tomorrow by this time; if necessary I will call on you again [I hope you wil not mind it]; o/
2009-03-01T22:18:00.000Z	ortsvorsteher	Cyclist	if i am here, no problem. :)
