2012-05-03T07:25:00.000Z	ayebear	vexaxv	does the game use opengl on both windows and linux?
2012-05-03T07:26:00.000Z	vexaxv	ayebear	im pretty sure it does, i think i remember seeying that but feel free to double check me
2012-05-03T07:26:00.000Z	ayebear	vexaxv	what video card do you have? (the brand name)
2012-05-03T07:26:00.000Z	vexaxv	ayebear	radeon 4200
2012-05-03T07:27:00.000Z	ayebear	vexaxv	ah it is probably just the drivers... you could try using openbox and see if it improves your FPS.
2012-05-03T07:27:00.000Z	vexaxv	ayebear	openbox?
2012-05-03T07:28:00.000Z	ayebear	vexaxv	it is a different window manager. i don't think you could run unity on it, so just try using unity2d which uses metacity. to do this, you could try doing metacity --replace, but it could mess up stuff, so just log off, and log back into "ubuntu 2d" by changing the option before you log in.
2012-05-03T07:29:00.000Z	vexaxv	ayebear	so use unity 2d and it should improve my performce?
2012-05-03T07:29:00.000Z	vexaxv	ayebear	that was obvious lol not to be rude i mean i didnt think of it
2012-05-03T07:31:00.000Z	vexaxv	ayebear	thanks for your help
