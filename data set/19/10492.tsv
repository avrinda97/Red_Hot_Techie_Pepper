2006-09-13T16:45:00.000Z	blinky		can anyone help me set up dual monitors with a nvidia 6600GT on ubuntu?
2006-09-13T16:46:00.000Z	ootput	blinky	likewise
2006-09-13T16:46:00.000Z	ootput	blinky	have you consulted the nvidia wiki entry yet?
2006-09-13T16:46:00.000Z	blinky	ootput	no, i am just starting to look into it now
2006-09-13T16:48:00.000Z	ootput	blinky	also, do intend on being able to drag windows across screens (xinerama, twinview,) or would you rather have each display separate?
2006-09-13T16:49:00.000Z	blinky	ootput	 i would like to use it prettymuch like windows dual monitors (able to drag across, yeah)
2006-09-13T16:50:00.000Z	ootput	blinky	I have a xorg.conf that allows separate displays, which contains custom modelines (for my monitors) and full acceleration on both displays. I was never a big fan of xinerama or twinview. I'm using a bfg 6800GT OC card.
2006-09-13T16:51:00.000Z	blinky	ootput	can i get it off you? what do you mean by seperate displays?
2006-09-13T16:51:00.000Z	blinky	ootput	like having to tab between displays?
2006-09-13T16:51:00.000Z	ootput	blinky	i'm able to use different window managers on either (xfce on one, and openbox on the other, for instance)
2006-09-13T16:51:00.000Z	ootput	blinky	with xinerama, iirc, only the first display has acceleration
2006-09-13T16:52:00.000Z	blinky	ootput	thats not a problem
2006-09-13T16:53:00.000Z	ootput	blinky	my xorg.conf:  http://pastebin.ca/168823
2006-09-13T16:53:00.000Z	ootput	blinky	the modelines allow me to manuall specify the refresh rates at the desired resolutions on either monitor
2006-09-13T16:55:00.000Z	blinky	ootput	yeah well these need different resolutions and refresh rates..
2006-09-13T16:55:00.000Z	blinky	ootput	gbrent, could i download/install xinerama through synaptic?
2006-09-13T16:56:00.000Z	ootput	blinky	ubuntu can (and most likely will) incorrectly detect the optimal refreshrate for a particular resolution. It's up to you to add the right modeline (google for modeline xorg generator, or something)
2006-09-13T16:57:00.000Z	ootput	blinky	no, that's not an apt feature. The nvidia site has documentation on setting up xinerama/twinview in Linux
