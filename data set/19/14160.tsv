2004-10-29T06:44:00.000Z	finn_		is there a guide somewhere for how to upgrade a kernel 'the ubuntu way'?  i'm trying to get ndiswrapper working and apprently first i need to upgrade the kernel.  i've tried googling and the wiki didn't seem to have anything on this
2004-10-29T06:45:00.000Z	uman	finn_	are you sure that the kernel needs updating ?
2004-10-29T06:45:00.000Z	finn_		well, the wiki entry on getting ndiswrapper to work says that i need to
2004-10-29T06:45:00.000Z	uman		kernel >2.4.23 should be fine for ndiswrapper
2004-10-29T06:46:00.000Z	uman	finn_	what kernel version do you have now ?
2004-10-29T06:47:00.000Z	finn_	uman	the stock one that comes with warthog RC, and installing ndiswrapper-utils wasn't enough to get ndiswrapper to work
2004-10-29T06:48:00.000Z	uman		for wlan you'll need ndiswrapper and wireless-tuils
2004-10-29T06:48:00.000Z	uman		utils
2004-10-29T06:48:00.000Z	uman		I don't know how ubuntu does it... maybe I SHOULD install it, heh
2004-10-29T06:48:00.000Z	finn_	uman	it complained about a missing module or something, and http://www.ubuntulinux.org/support/documentation/howto/helpcenterhowto.2004-10-07.7773155363 says i need linux-image-2.6.7.1-3* or later
2004-10-29T06:49:00.000Z	uman		I've used ndiswrapper with 2.4. kernels fine
2004-10-29T06:49:00.000Z	uman		as long as they were 2.4.23 or later
2004-10-29T06:49:00.000Z	finn_		the wireless config part isn't the problem, ndiswrapper isn't being happy (and i managed to get it working with gentoo)
2004-10-29T06:50:00.000Z	uman	finn_	I'll better stop blabbing, I'm not eaving running ubunti
2004-10-29T06:50:00.000Z	uman		ubuntu
2004-10-29T06:50:00.000Z	uman		I shall soon, though
2004-10-29T06:50:00.000Z	finn_		that's cool, i'd be running it right now if i could work out how to get my wireless card working with it... laptop with no net connection is like a large paperweight
2004-10-29T06:51:00.000Z	uman		I still use crux atm
2004-10-29T06:51:00.000Z	uman	finn_	if you want a nice live CD, mepis has working ndiswrapper and wireless tools
