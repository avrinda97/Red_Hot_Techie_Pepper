Try logging in with one of the failsafe sessions to see if you can fix this problem
2009-10-11T07:53:00.000Z	carpediem	nic1	that happens anytime X fails immediately
2009-10-11T07:53:00.000Z	carpediem	nic1	have you been messing with X, or is this a new install?
2009-10-11T07:54:00.000Z	carpediem	nic1	have you been messing with X, or is this a new install?
2009-10-11T07:58:00.000Z	nic1	carpediem	not a new install
2009-10-11T07:59:00.000Z	carpediem	nic1	have you been playing with X config lately?
2009-10-11T08:01:00.000Z	carpediem	nic1	what do you mean you installed xdesktop?  that could be it if it altered /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2009-10-11T08:02:00.000Z	carpediem	nic1	to empty trash you just right click on it and choose empty
2009-10-14T10:14:00.000Z	carpediem	nic1	what warning levels
2009-10-14T10:17:00.000Z	nic1	carpediem	i tried making a package, and just a variable being declared and not being used stops my make telling error:
2009-10-14T10:18:00.000Z	carpediem	nic1	if the compiler decides its an error, its an error.
2009-10-14T10:18:00.000Z	carpediem	nic1	you can't "make it a warning"
2009-10-14T10:20:00.000Z	carpediem	nic1	but a little googling shows that that package has problems being compiled with gcc 4.3
2009-10-14T10:21:00.000Z	carpediem	nic1	you will need to use an older gcc, or find out if the developers have fixed the issue.  Google is a good place to search for your error.
2009-10-14T10:22:00.000Z	carpediem	nic1	I googled for you, and there's plenty of info to look at
2009-10-14T10:24:00.000Z	nic1	carpediem	sure i wil google and can you please tell me command to see the version of gcc?
2009-10-14T10:51:00.000Z	nic1	carpediem	i got the ebuild patch for my error, can you please tel me how to patch it??
2009-10-14T10:51:00.000Z	carpediem	nic1	ebuilds are gentoo
2009-10-14T10:51:00.000Z	carpediem	nic1	meaning, gentoo != ubuntu
