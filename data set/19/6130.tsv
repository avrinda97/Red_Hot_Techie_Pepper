2008-03-11T12:24:00.000Z	mdemocritus	hfmls	unfortunately i haven't messed with themes, and besides it's different for gnome... i'm running kubuntu these days, so i don't even have the same interface as you... try googling ubuntu theme install
2008-03-11T12:27:00.000Z	mdemocritus	hfmls	i think its in themes or windows or something like that... in the prefrences or system menu
2008-03-11T12:27:00.000Z	mdemocritus	hfmls	aha
