2006-04-10T11:24:00.000Z	Mitja		Where can I find root settings at boot?
2006-04-10T11:24:00.000Z	carthik	Mitja	what do you mean by "root settings"?
2006-04-10T11:25:00.000Z	Mitja	carthik	global ones
2006-04-10T11:25:00.000Z	Mitja	carthik	system-wide
2006-04-10T11:25:00.000Z	carthik	Mitja	that is not vey helpful in making it clearer. could you explain what settings you wnt to see? settings for which application?
2006-04-10T11:26:00.000Z	Mitja	carthik	settings that get loaded when a computer is booted.
2006-04-10T11:26:00.000Z	Mitja	carthik	for all users, the entire OS
2006-04-10T11:26:00.000Z	carthik	Mitja	the entire OS, well, it is all over the place.... tell us what exactly your problem is, and we can help
2006-04-10T11:27:00.000Z	carthik	Mitja	explain in detail what you want to do, so we can see what you want
2006-04-10T11:27:00.000Z	Mitja	carthik	I want to set shmmax to be permanent of certain value
2006-04-10T11:28:00.000Z	carthik	Mitja	what is shmmax? something somewhere in /proc/ ? where exactly?
2006-04-10T11:28:00.000Z	Mitja	carthik	/proc/sys/kernel/shmmax
2006-04-10T11:32:00.000Z	carthik	Mitja	there that was much better, you can edit /etc/sysctl.conf and add kernel.shmmax = 2147483648 (or whatever you want) and save it. The next time you reboot the value will be set right. If you want to change it without rebooting, use $sudo /sbin/sysctl -p
2006-04-10T11:32:00.000Z	carthik	Mitja	is that what you were looking for? why do you need to mess with that, if I may ask?
2006-04-10T11:32:00.000Z	Mitja	carthik	what if there is no /etc/sysctl.conf? Do I create it?
2006-04-10T11:34:00.000Z	carthik	Mitja	highly unlikely that you wont have it, check the spelling, and if you dont have one, create it. man sysctl.conf for detailed notes - read it
2006-04-10T11:35:00.000Z	Mitja	carthik	sorry, there is one, just tab in console won't show it
2006-04-10T11:36:00.000Z	carthik	Mitja	next time that happens, try two tabs, this will give you a list of files matching the letters you typed
2006-04-13T06:34:00.000Z	carthik	Mitja	care to explain a bit more detail?
