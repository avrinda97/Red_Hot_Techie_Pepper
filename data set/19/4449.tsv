2009-02-10T12:46:00.000Z	DeadDrive		Ya, didn't think about messing with the permissions
2009-02-10T12:47:00.000Z	DeadDrive		burning speed seems a lot better with kde
2009-02-10T12:48:00.000Z	DeadDrive		ya :) Mev, I'm also burning a cd iso and not dvd :)
2009-02-10T12:48:00.000Z	DeadDrive		I know, the burning is faster because it is a cd and not dvd
2009-02-10T12:49:00.000Z	DeadDrive		Ya, the only thing I miss about windows is Zmud running better :)
2009-02-10T12:49:00.000Z	DeadDrive		Haven't found a linux native client that compares
2009-02-10T12:50:00.000Z	DeadDrive		a faster computer would help my burning speeds too
2009-02-10T12:51:00.000Z	DeadDrive		<---p3 running at 448mhz with 640 megs of ram
2009-02-10T12:52:00.000Z	DeadDrive		That's not true Titan, there are things where GUI is better.
2009-02-10T12:52:00.000Z	DeadDrive		dmphot, command line interface
2009-02-10T12:53:00.000Z	Titan8990	DeadDrive	agreed, I would be lost without phpmyadmin for mysql
2009-02-10T12:53:00.000Z	Titan8990	DeadDrive	but for the most part, it is true
2009-02-10T12:57:00.000Z	Titan8990	DeadDrive	also you can usually do apt-cache search faster than you can even open synaptic :)
2009-02-10T14:16:00.000Z	Titan8990	DeadDrive	don't know the drill?
2009-02-10T14:18:00.000Z	Titan8990	DeadDrive	very possible because there will likely be some kernel updates in there
2009-02-10T14:33:00.000Z	Titan8990	DeadDrive	have you tried?
2009-02-10T14:33:00.000Z	Titan8990	DeadDrive	running compiz on that atique
2009-02-10T15:24:00.000Z	Titan8990	DeadDrive	:(
2009-02-10T15:52:00.000Z	Titan8990	DeadDrive	congrats
