2009-01-29T11:51:00.000Z	Gohalien_NB		i already download linux header, build essential... no clue why it wont install
2009-01-29T11:53:00.000Z	cool2k	Gohalien_NB	did you installed the kernel headers?
2009-01-29T11:55:00.000Z	cool2k	Gohalien_NB	ok, did you use the comand ./configure before make??
2009-01-29T11:56:00.000Z	cool2k	Gohalien_NB	do that (./configure) so it will configure properly to use make and try make again
2009-01-29T12:02:00.000Z	cool2k	Gohalien_NB	i think your problem could be the tree where you have your drivers
2009-01-29T12:07:00.000Z	cool2k	Gohalien_NB	is your problem solved??
2009-01-29T12:08:00.000Z	cool2k	Gohalien_NB	move your madwifi-hal-0.10.5.6-r3933-20090127 dir into some other place, maybe your home dir
2009-01-29T12:10:00.000Z	cool2k	Gohalien_NB	you have and space in de dir name "Driver notebook", i think it could be the problem
2009-01-29T12:10:00.000Z	Gohalien_NB	cool2k	k i will move it
2009-01-29T12:12:00.000Z	cool2k	Gohalien_NB	once you have moved or copied it  try "make" and "sudo make install" again
2009-01-29T12:12:00.000Z	Gohalien_NB	cool2k	savvas problem solved.... it was the space
2009-01-29T12:12:00.000Z	cool2k	Gohalien_NB	ok
2009-01-29T12:14:00.000Z	cool2k	Gohalien_NB	yeap, stranger things will happend man (jajaja), you could see that it was the problem by watching this line:  make[1]: *** No rule to make target `notebook/Wireless/madwifi-hal-0.10.5.6-r3933-20090127'.  Stop.
2009-01-29T12:14:00.000Z	Gohalien_NB	cool2k	 savvas, thanks a lot for your help, for sure I wasnt goint to change the dir name, for the reason I said before, I compiled already the drivers for other kernels in same directory
2009-01-29T12:15:00.000Z	cool2k	Gohalien_NB	yes, i think that happend to me to once
