2011-02-19T15:02:00.000Z	jrgill		can someone please tell me how to use this?  http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/lucid/man1/get-edid.1.html
2011-02-19T15:03:00.000Z	ikonia	jrgill	what's the issue with it ?
2011-02-19T15:03:00.000Z	jrgill	ikonia	i downloaded it and ungzipped it.  how do i use it?
2011-02-19T15:03:00.000Z	ikonia	jrgill	use the deb
2011-02-19T15:04:00.000Z	ikonia	jrgill	it doesn't matter, use the deb
2011-02-19T15:04:00.000Z	ikonia	jrgill	install the package "read-edid"
2011-02-19T15:05:00.000Z	ikonia	jrgill	open the package manager, and install the package "read-edid" you can then use that command
2011-02-19T15:05:00.000Z	ikonia	jrgill	it's another file type,
2011-02-19T15:06:00.000Z	ikonia	jrgill	run file against it
2011-02-19T15:06:00.000Z	ikonia	jrgill	can't you just install the package and run the command you want
2011-02-19T15:07:00.000Z	jrgill	ikonia	i can install it through the package manager, but i dont see why you cant explain what i found; im not an idiot.
2011-02-19T15:08:00.000Z	ikonia	jrgill	it's a man page, and if you read the info, you'd know it was a man page
2011-02-19T15:08:00.000Z	ikonia	jrgill	the fact that I told you how to find out what it was and you wouldn't do it, so I had to download it for you and see what it was suggests to the contrary
2011-02-19T15:09:00.000Z	jrgill	ikonia	if you had to download it, it suggests the contrary to you as well...
2011-02-19T15:09:00.000Z	ikonia	jrgill	not at all, you'd be surprised how many people don't download the file correctly
2011-02-19T15:15:00.000Z	jrgill	ikonia	how does someone download that file incorrectly?
2011-02-19T15:15:00.000Z	ikonia	jrgill	fail to unzip it properly
2011-02-19T15:23:00.000Z	ikonia	jrgill	synaptic is the package manager and I told you the exact package name earlier
2011-02-19T15:52:00.000Z	ikonia	jrgill	try them out, it's personal taste
