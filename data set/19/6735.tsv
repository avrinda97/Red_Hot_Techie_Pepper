2007-12-14T11:15:00.000Z	jahisthebalance		I just want to open the networks program again so I can switch networks easily like I did less than ten minutes ago
2007-12-14T11:16:00.000Z	jahisthebalance		so if it's not incredibly silly to ask, how would I restart nm-applet?
2007-12-14T11:17:00.000Z	balleyne	jahisthebalance	try typing "nm-applet &" into the terminal (without the quotes)
2007-12-14T11:18:00.000Z	jahisthebalance	balleyne	that didn't quite do it honestly
2007-12-14T11:20:00.000Z	balleyne	jahisthebalance	nothing happened when you did that? a brute force way could be just to log out and back in, the app should load on startup even if you've managed to close it now
2007-12-14T11:23:00.000Z	balleyne	jahisthebalance	there are some things that are panel items/gadget things, and other things that go into the notification area on the panel when a program is running - that's the difference
2007-12-14T11:34:00.000Z	balleyne	jahisthebalance	blah... so, running 'nm-applet' from the command line doesn't do anything?
2007-12-14T11:36:00.000Z	balleyne	jahisthebalance	right.. I had that problem a while back, I was almost positive that running nm-applet brought the applet back (ie. the selector)
2007-12-14T11:44:00.000Z	balleyne	jahisthebalance	... are you sure you have the notification applet on your panel? a bit of a far fetched guess, but if that's gone then nm-applet will have no where to appear
2007-12-14T11:45:00.000Z	balleyne	jahisthebalance	if you open a program like say... pidgin, will that appear in the notification area?
2007-12-14T11:45:00.000Z	balleyne	jahisthebalance	also, `ps -e | grep nm-applet` should tell you for sure if the applet is running (whether or not you can see it)
2007-12-14T11:46:00.000Z	jahisthebalance	balleyne	as a matter of fact it does not
2007-12-14T11:46:00.000Z	balleyne	jahisthebalance	there you go!
2007-12-14T11:47:00.000Z	balleyne	jahisthebalance	ok, try right-clicking on the panel, Add Applet, and make sure to put a Notification Area onto the panel, then see if those programs appear
2007-12-14T11:47:00.000Z	balleyne	jahisthebalance	also, 'ps -e | grep nm-applet' should tell you if it's running, regardless of whether or not you can see it
2007-12-14T11:49:00.000Z	balleyne	jahisthebalance	sorry, maybe it just says "Add" or something? when you right-click a blank area of the panel? (assuming you're in Gnome and not KDE or XFCE)
2007-12-14T11:50:00.000Z	balleyne	jahisthebalance	ok, yeah, that's what you want. Click than, then select something that says Notification Area or something like that from the list, and drag it to the top left where those icons should be appearing
2007-12-14T11:51:00.000Z	balleyne	jahisthebalance	ahahaha, nice! better than none, lol
2007-12-14T11:52:00.000Z	balleyne	jahisthebalance	np!
