2006-09-15T05:40:00.000Z	Douggie		Can apt be set to download a packages dependencies automatically? trying to install libsdl-dev but getting a heap of umet libraries..
2006-09-15T05:41:00.000Z	jrib	Douggie	pastebin the output and your sources.list
2006-09-15T06:04:00.000Z	jrib	Douggie	pastebin the whole message as well as your sources
2006-09-15T06:12:00.000Z	jrib	Douggie	sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install libsdl1.2-dev   <-- still the same thing after this?
2006-09-15T06:19:00.000Z	Douggie	jrib	Doesn't seem to have attempted to install, however to throw some failed to fetch errors on the update in relation to the new sources and Sources.gz (404 error)
2006-09-15T06:21:00.000Z	jrib	Douggie	hmm can you put those errors on pastebin as well?
2006-09-15T06:33:00.000Z	jrib	Douggie	it is most likely an issue with your repository setup
2006-09-15T06:34:00.000Z	jrib	Douggie	the update now goes through without error, and you still have the same error?
2006-09-15T06:34:00.000Z	Douggie	jrib	Yes
2006-09-15T06:34:00.000Z	jrib	Douggie	what does 'sudo apt-get install libesd0-dev' say?
2006-09-15T06:36:00.000Z	Douggie	jrib	Depends: libaudiofile-dev but it is not going to be installed'
2006-09-15T06:37:00.000Z	jrib	Douggie	keep trying to install what it says until it gives you something meaningfull
2006-09-15T06:40:00.000Z	jrib	Douggie	I need to reboot now, another thing you could try is passing -v to apt-get and see if it gives you more info.  Eventually you usually get to the root of the problem
2006-09-15T06:50:00.000Z	jrib	Douggie	what happened?
2006-09-15T06:54:00.000Z	Douggie	jrib	Nothing will install and uninstall with apt, is there any way I can 'check' the integrity of apt itself, something has obviously messed with a configuration file or the like...might just be easier to reinstall
2006-09-15T06:55:00.000Z	jrib	Douggie	I noticed, that there was a problems witht he codeblocks install.  It may be complaining about that until you resolve it
2006-09-15T07:01:00.000Z	Douggie	jrib	Very difficult to install the dependency it's looking for because once I download it, libpango1.0-common for example wont install because some totally unrelated dependency is unsatisfiable...how difficult is it to reinstall apt-get?
2006-09-15T07:03:00.000Z	jrib	Douggie	you shouldn't download and overwrite current versions, that usually causes trouble.  Can you remove codeblocks for now and see if you can resolve your other problems?
2006-09-15T07:06:00.000Z	Douggie	jrib	Uninstalled codeblocks and now apt will install again....how weird
