2010-12-22T08:01:00.000Z	glitchd		i keep getting an error when trying to install a plugin in pidgin http://pastie.org/1396893
2010-12-22T08:01:00.000Z	glitchd		can someone help me?
2010-12-22T08:03:00.000Z	trism	glitchd	you likely need to install libnotify-dev
2010-12-22T08:03:00.000Z	glitchd	trism	instead of just libnotify? or in place of libnotify?
2010-12-22T08:04:00.000Z	glitchd	trism	??
2010-12-22T08:05:00.000Z	trism	glitchd	you need both, one is just the library, the -dev package has headers needed to link programs to the library
2010-12-22T08:05:00.000Z	glitchd	trism	ok ill try installing the dev and see if that solves the compiling problem then, thx
2010-12-22T08:11:00.000Z	glitchd	trism	dammit. now its telling me that i need checking for PIDGIN... configure: error: Package requirements (pidgin >= 2.0.0) were not met:
2010-12-22T08:11:00.000Z	glitchd	trism	but i have pidgin, its even open right now
2010-12-22T08:11:00.000Z	glitchd	trism	im not understanding this at all
2010-12-22T08:13:00.000Z	trism	glitchd	when you compile software, you need the -dev packages for program, that provide necessary header files to compile, in this case pidgin-dev
2010-12-22T08:14:00.000Z	trism	glitchd	the headers are kept in a separate package from the programs and libraries because most people don't need them
2010-12-22T08:14:00.000Z	glitchd	trism	r00t4rd3d, im tryin to get pidgins libnotify to work
2010-12-22T08:14:00.000Z	glitchd	trism	so i should get the pidgin-dev package from synaptic?
2010-12-22T08:14:00.000Z	trism	glitchd	you shouldn't need to compile anything for that, libnotify support is included by default
2010-12-22T08:15:00.000Z	trism	glitchd	Tools/Plugins/Libnotify Popups
2010-12-22T08:15:00.000Z	glitchd	trism	i was changing the notify package to display differently
2010-12-22T08:16:00.000Z	trism	glitchd	yes, or: sudo apt-get install pidgin-dev;
2010-12-22T08:17:00.000Z	glitchd	trism	thx ill try again nd see if it works this time
