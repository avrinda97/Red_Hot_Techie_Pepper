2006-12-17T13:06:00.000Z	stockfisch		hi folks, ive got a azureus problem... my upload is below 1kB, though it is limited to 100kB. I am seeding ubuntu isos, but this way my share ratio is far from good
2006-12-17T13:06:00.000Z	stockfisch		suggestions?
2006-12-17T13:08:00.000Z	stockfisch		this one iso at the moment
2006-12-17T13:09:00.000Z	stockfisch		wtf?
2006-12-17T13:09:00.000Z	stockfisch		somehow my complete network seems to be messed up
2006-12-17T13:10:00.000Z	stockfisch		azureus just crashed and kicked xchat, too
2006-12-17T13:12:00.000Z	stockfisch		i have possibly found the error...
2006-12-17T13:12:00.000Z	stockfisch		java takes 99% cpu
2006-12-17T13:12:00.000Z	stockfisch		can anyone tell how this might come?
2006-12-17T13:13:00.000Z	stockfisch		i mean how i can find out?
2006-12-17T13:13:00.000Z	yeager	stockfisch	garbage collection or just a crappy java application perhaps
2006-12-17T13:14:00.000Z	yeager	stockfisch	azureus is known to use too much cpu. try qbittorrent instead
2006-12-17T13:14:00.000Z	yeager	stockfisch	no, ubuntu package available at www.qbittorrent.org
2006-12-17T13:16:00.000Z	yeager	stockfisch	yes, a qt4 gui
2006-12-17T13:24:00.000Z	yeager	stockfisch	well, try qbittorrent, it's qt4 (kde) and easy to use
2006-12-17T13:45:00.000Z	yeager	stockfisch	did you like qbittorrent?
2006-12-17T13:52:00.000Z	yeager	stockfisch	set it up as default application for .torrent files
2006-12-17T13:54:00.000Z	stockfisch	yeager	how do i set the default application for a file type under ubuntu?
2006-12-17T13:58:00.000Z	yeager	stockfisch	:)
