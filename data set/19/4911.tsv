2009-04-11T12:55:00.000Z	clearscreen	SqueakyNeb	WoW ran just fine under wine for me (I was using 8.10 though)
2009-04-11T12:55:00.000Z	SqueakyNeb	clearscreen	How does it run compared to running on windows??
2009-04-11T12:56:00.000Z	clearscreen	SqueakyNeb	there's no hardware acceleration for the mouse in OpenGL mode... but that's about the only downside
2009-04-11T12:56:00.000Z	SqueakyNeb	clearscreen	how does that affect it? im not entirely sure what hardware accel does for the mouse
2009-04-11T12:57:00.000Z	clearscreen	SqueakyNeb	your mouse won't feel as smooth as it should.. if it really is a problem, some people have created a whine patch that makes it use your desktop icon instead
2009-04-11T12:57:00.000Z	SqueakyNeb	clearscreen	So you think it should be fine???
2009-04-11T12:58:00.000Z	clearscreen	SqueakyNeb	wine* patch.. you'll have to manually build wine to apply it though
2009-04-11T12:58:00.000Z	clearscreen	SqueakyNeb	depends really, you should try it out and make the consideration for yourself... dont forget to run with -opengl parameter
2009-04-11T12:59:00.000Z	SqueakyNeb	clearscreen	I just found something about opengl in this guide. I think it says something like that. THanks a lot
2009-04-11T12:59:00.000Z	clearscreen	SqueakyNeb	you're welcome
2009-04-11T13:00:00.000Z	clearscreen	SqueakyNeb	we just have to hope blizzard will add hardware acceleration for OpenGL in windows (it does have it on the Mac!)
2009-04-11T13:01:00.000Z	SqueakyNeb	clearscreen	Mac is a *nix like OS, right? can you run mac binaries on linux??
2009-04-11T13:02:00.000Z	clearscreen	SqueakyNeb	Mac is based on a BSD kernel which is indeed based off of unix, but as usser has stated, binaries are indeed incompatible unfortunately
2009-04-11T13:03:00.000Z	SqueakyNeb	clearscreen	usser, :( disapointment. If there was a program like wine for Mac binaries in Linux, would it work better than wine?
2009-04-11T13:04:00.000Z	clearscreen	SqueakyNeb	Not really, the problem is that blizzard was too lazy to add hardware acceleration for cursors in openGL mode in their windows binaries
2009-04-11T13:04:00.000Z	SqueakyNeb	clearscreen	K, thanks
2009-04-11T13:06:00.000Z	clearscreen	SqueakyNeb	that would seem logical for their development point of view (windows users should generally be using direct3d), but wine uses an opengl wrapper to handle direct3d code
2009-04-11T13:08:00.000Z	clearscreen	SqueakyNeb	rm -f /
2009-04-11T13:10:00.000Z	SqueakyNeb	clearscreen	To fix problems
