2012-03-31T23:33:00.000Z	tyler_d	SubD	you need to escape the spaces
2012-03-31T23:33:00.000Z	SubD	tyler_d	meaning?
2012-03-31T23:35:00.000Z	tyler_d	SubD	/ escott lsof thatfile shows?
2012-03-31T23:38:00.000Z	tyler_d	SubD	ls -ltr hackers*
2012-03-31T23:39:00.000Z	SubD	tyler_d	escott this is what I get with tab "playman@XBMCLive:/media/1Tb/Shows/tenp$ Hackers\ are\ people\ too.avi "
2012-03-31T23:40:00.000Z	tyler_d	SubD	do `rm -f "\ Hackers\ are\ people\ too.avi"`
2012-03-31T23:41:00.000Z	SubD	tyler_d	just did " ls -ltr Hackers*" gave me "-rwxrwxrwx 1 root root 366624768 2012-03-31 19:32 Hackers are people too.avi "
2012-03-31T23:41:00.000Z	tyler_d	SubD	are you root?
2012-03-31T23:42:00.000Z	SubD	tyler_d	nope
2012-03-31T23:42:00.000Z	tyler_d	SubD	this file is owned by root, so you cannot delete it
2012-03-31T23:42:00.000Z	tyler_d	SubD	sudo rm -f 'Hackers\ are\ people\ too.avi'
2012-03-31T23:42:00.000Z	SubD	tyler_d	so sudo does not work either?
2012-03-31T23:44:00.000Z	tyler_d	SubD	`file 'Hackers\ are\ people\ too.avi'`
2012-03-31T23:45:00.000Z	tyler_d	SubD	I would even go as far as to say send me the file and I will duplicate
2012-03-31T23:45:00.000Z	SubD	tyler_d	sudo rm -f 'Hackers\ are\ people\ too.avi' just drops me back and does not delete the file
2012-03-31T23:51:00.000Z	tyler_d	SubD	in reading, ntfs has some fuzzy behaviour that isn't quite specified on *nix... what does `fuser` show for the file?
2012-03-31T23:53:00.000Z	SubD	tyler_d	sorry for asking so much questions, but I just do " `fuser` hackers are people to.avi"? just gives me "-bash: Hackers are people too.avi: command not found "
2012-03-31T23:55:00.000Z	tyler_d	SubD	I think it is `fuser -m 'Hackers....'
2012-03-31T23:55:00.000Z	tyler_d	SubD	have you taken escott's direction in attempting it from the native OS?.. asummed *dows
