2009-11-22T02:18:00.000Z	hackel1		It works for other guests here.  And I have been connecting to other aps fine with this computer for months, both public and encrypted.
2009-11-22T02:18:00.000Z	nytek_	hackel1	what is the card?
2009-11-22T02:18:00.000Z	hackel1	nytek_	bcm4312
2009-11-22T02:19:00.000Z	nytek_	hackel1	ubuntu 9.10 right?
2009-11-22T02:19:00.000Z	hackel1	nytek_	yes, that's right.
2009-11-22T02:20:00.000Z	nytek_	hackel1	one second, doing some research
2009-11-22T02:23:00.000Z	nytek_	hackel1	have you followed this thread at all? http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1288865&page=2
2009-11-22T02:23:00.000Z	nytek_	hackel1	it seems that people have resolved the issue
2009-11-22T02:24:00.000Z	hackel1	nytek_	that.s just about installing the driver.  As I said, the card works just fine with most other access points.  There is just some peculiar incompatibility with this particular ap (one that doesn't seem to exist on Windows).
2009-11-22T02:25:00.000Z	nytek_	hackel1	then it the network, not your card
2009-11-22T02:25:00.000Z	nytek_		its*
2009-11-22T02:26:00.000Z	nytek_	hackel1	you could always downgrade
2009-11-22T02:26:00.000Z	nytek_	hackel1	:(
2009-11-22T02:26:00.000Z	hackel1	nytek_	upgrading wasn't the issue.  I mean, I never had a chance to test this particular access point with any earlier version.
2009-11-22T02:27:00.000Z	nytek_	hackel1	but you've connected to it before? with a unix based machine?
2009-11-22T02:27:00.000Z	hackel1	nytek_	no, I haven't...
2009-11-22T02:29:00.000Z	nytek_	hackel1	what about testing it on another machine, or popping in a live cd and seeing if you can connect to it
2009-11-22T02:30:00.000Z	hackel1	nytek_	don't really have that option as I'm in a hotel, I just happened to ask some other guests if they were able to connect and it works for them.
2009-11-22T02:32:00.000Z	nytek_	hackel1	i dont know then, im sorry. do you think there could be something against non windows and mac machine configured into the network?
