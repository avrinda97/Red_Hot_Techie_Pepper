2007-04-10T14:38:00.000Z	Gabz	Quarup	you installed your kernal headers ?
2007-04-10T14:39:00.000Z	Quarup	Gabz	kbidd  Yes it says linux-headers-2.6.20-14-generic is already the newest version.

2007-04-10T14:41:00.000Z	Quarup	Gabz	did ya see the link?
2007-04-10T14:43:00.000Z	Gabz	Quarup	 are you sure you did these right "apt-get install build-essential linux-headers-`uname -r`"
2007-04-10T14:43:00.000Z	Gabz	Quarup	you also probably want to run sudo make
2007-04-10T14:43:00.000Z	Quarup	Gabz	I copy pasted it, and I checked and tried again and I got this linux-headers-2.6.20-14-generic is already the newest version.
2007-04-10T14:45:00.000Z	Gabz	Quarup	 um.. the problem is apt-get install  linux-headers-`uname -r`  double check that worked
2007-04-10T14:45:00.000Z	Quarup	Gabz	please read what I just told you before that
2007-04-10T14:45:00.000Z	Quarup	Gabz	here I will repaste it for you
2007-04-10T14:46:00.000Z	Quarup	Gabz	I copy pasted it, and I checked and tried again and I got this linux-headers-2.6.20-14-generic is already the newest version.
2007-04-10T14:46:00.000Z	Quarup	Gabz	so NO that is not the problem
