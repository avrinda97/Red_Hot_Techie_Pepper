2010-03-05T12:45:00.000Z	Andorin		This is serious... I cannot afford to lose access to the data on this drive.
2010-03-05T12:46:00.000Z	Andorin		Guys, Ubuntu has suddenly stopped being able to mount my portable HD, and I REALLY need access to it!
2010-03-05T12:46:00.000Z	theadmin	Andorin	Try to fsck it
2010-04-11T08:25:00.000Z	theadmin	Andorin	Well, you can do "sudo apt-get purge pidgin rhythmbox gimp && sudo apt-get autoremove"
2010-04-11T08:32:00.000Z	theadmin	Andorin	Oh, OH. tasksel will help you (do "sudo tasksel")
2010-04-11T08:33:00.000Z	Andorin	theadmin	What will this do, exactly? I'm looking at it atm
2010-04-11T08:33:00.000Z	theadmin	Andorin	It's a metapackage manager
2010-04-11T08:34:00.000Z	Andorin	theadmin	So... this will let her do... what? I see "You can choose to install one or more predefined collections of software." Will this reset the packages on her system?
2010-04-11T08:34:00.000Z	theadmin	Andorin	Well, if you remove ubuntustudio with tasksel, it will also drag away all packages that came with it
2010-04-11T08:38:00.000Z	Andorin	theadmin	Does she want "manual package selection"?
2010-04-11T08:39:00.000Z	theadmin	Andorin	I've no idea whether "she" wants it. You want to remove Ubuntustudio, i tell ya how to do it
2010-04-11T08:39:00.000Z	Andorin	theadmin	I'm trying to help my friend.
2010-04-11T08:45:00.000Z	theadmin	Andorin	Just find Ubuntu Studio there, press space, press enter
2010-04-11T08:46:00.000Z	Andorin	theadmin	If Ubuntu Studio is supposed to be in that very first list that appears when you run tasksel, she says it's not there. Which is why I asked about manual package stuff.
2010-04-11T08:47:00.000Z	theadmin	Andorin	Hm. Sorry, problem is I don't have a Ubuntu machine near me. Might have forgotten.
2010-04-11T08:49:00.000Z	theadmin	Andorin	Well, you can use other support software (Yuuguu, for instance), it's simplier. That one requires X and Java though
2010-04-11T08:51:00.000Z	theadmin	Andorin	is right, vegar_, Synaptic and apt-get don't mark dependencies when removing metapackages
2010-04-11T08:56:00.000Z	Andorin	theadmin	vegar_: trina is the one I'm trying to help, so tell her what to run in order to remove the dependencies
2010-04-11T08:57:00.000Z	theadmin	Andorin	I think you can run "sudo tasksel remove ubuntustudio" or "sudo tasksel remove ubuntu-studio", unsure what's the proper name
