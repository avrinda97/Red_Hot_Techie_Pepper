2012-02-06T01:07:00.000Z	frybye		anybody else have a tip on how to recover after a bad manual nvidia driver install...?
2012-02-06T01:09:00.000Z	frybye		I would imagine that if you personally think method a is bad you know enough to be able to use method b c or d I dont...
2012-02-06T01:11:00.000Z	frybye		can -somebody- tell me to delet a bad xorg.config on booting...?
2012-02-06T01:11:00.000Z	frybye		assuming this is the right way to recover the system...
2012-02-06T01:12:00.000Z	auronandace	frybye	deleting xorg.conf won't magically uninstall the nvidia driver
2012-02-06T01:13:00.000Z	frybye	auronandace	I see - so what do.. i need to do...?
2012-02-06T01:14:00.000Z	auronandace	frybye	i've never installed the nvidia driver from their website, i stick to the repo, hang on
2012-02-06T01:16:00.000Z	frybye	auronandace	I dont have a lot of background ubuntu knowledge.. I followed instructions again and again yesterday for an established method of installing but none of it actually worked.. that is why out of desperation I tried thisr risky method.. thanks for your concern...
2012-02-06T01:16:00.000Z	auronandace	frybye	there is an uninstall section here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/NvidiaManual
2012-02-06T01:19:00.000Z	frybye	auronandace	had a look at the nvidia manual - but to do the stuff they say I need read+write access to the system - I dont know how to get that at the moment - the recovery consol only gives read access?
2012-02-06T01:20:00.000Z	auronandace	frybye	you're at the recovery console? well, thats a bit beyond me, i've never got my system into that state
2012-02-06T01:20:00.000Z	auronandace	frybye	sorry i can't help
2012-02-06T01:20:00.000Z	frybye	auronandace	well not sure what it is called in english - i am a brit living in berlin and so have a germanlanguage ubuntu 11.10
2012-02-06T01:21:00.000Z	frybye	auronandace	ok - thanks for the try...
2012-02-06T01:22:00.000Z	auronandace	frybye	i'm from uk too, but i think recovery console is the right term, i've just never been there
2012-02-06T01:22:00.000Z	frybye	auronandace	i see - but do you know any way to get read+write access when the video driver is shot to hell and back..
2012-02-06T01:23:00.000Z	frybye	auronandace	just out of interest - which part - i am a cornishman...
2012-02-06T01:24:00.000Z	auronandace	frybye	i don't know sorry, i'd recommend a fresh install (backup what you need with a livecd) (i was born in essex but lived in wales most my life)
2012-02-06T01:27:00.000Z	frybye	auronandace	spent a great 2 weeks holiday "celebrating"my first divorce in aberistwith... back in a bit...
