2009-02-09T14:52:00.000Z	riz0n		anyone here have any experience with ircd-hybrid on ubuntu?
2009-02-09T14:53:00.000Z	riz0n		i have a small irc conferencing server set up using irc-hybrid and ubuntu
2009-02-09T14:53:00.000Z	riz0n		the number of clients to my server will be between 5 to 10 users
2009-02-09T14:53:00.000Z	Sergeant_Pony	riz0n	I use unreal ircd
2009-02-09T14:54:00.000Z	riz0n	Sergeant_Pony	how hard is it to set up on Ubuntu?
2009-02-09T14:54:00.000Z	Sergeant_Pony	riz0n	was very easy, took me less than 2 minutes
2009-02-09T14:55:00.000Z	Sergeant_Pony	riz0n	very easy, took me less than 2 minues
2009-02-09T14:55:00.000Z	riz0n	Sergeant_Pony	does it allow you to set modes in channels as an irc op but not an operator in the chan?
2009-02-09T14:56:00.000Z	Sergeant_Pony	riz0n	that I'm not sure... I'm an ircop so I have full control
2009-02-09T14:57:00.000Z	riz0n	Sergeant_Pony	right, well the problem i had with ircd-hybrid was that when i was an oper, it would not let me set modes in channels (for instance if i joined a channel with no ops i could not op myself or anyone else)
2009-02-09T14:58:00.000Z	Sergeant_Pony	riz0n	what are you looking for exactly, when I'm an ircop I have full control. so I can op myself and others if need be.
2009-02-09T14:58:00.000Z	riz0n		i just want to be able to op/deop set/unset bans without being a channel op while being an irc op
2009-02-09T14:59:00.000Z	Sergeant_Pony	riz0n	that I can do with unreal
2009-02-09T14:59:00.000Z	riz0n		my irc server will never carry more than 5 to 10 people in a channel at a time... i cant see justifying setting up "services" for this server
2009-02-09T15:00:00.000Z	riz0n		basically the irc server is only bound to 127.0.0.1 and the end users will be sshing to the irc server and then running irssi to connect to the irc server
2009-02-09T15:00:00.000Z	riz0n		this way all connecting clients is guaranteed a layer of ssl encryption when chatting through the system
2009-02-09T15:00:00.000Z	Sergeant_Pony	riz0n	ok.. take a look at unreal. as long as your in the unrealircd.conf file as the ircop it should work out for you.
2009-02-09T15:01:00.000Z	riz0n		 kewl
2009-02-09T15:01:00.000Z	riz0n	Sergeant_Pony	can you set up unreal to automatically force a user to join a channel upon connect?
