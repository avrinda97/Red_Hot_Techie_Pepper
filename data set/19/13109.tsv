2005-05-22T11:22:00.000Z	Thirsteh		Guess I gotta reboot to eject the CD, lol
2005-05-22T11:23:00.000Z	Thirsteh		lol
2005-05-22T11:23:00.000Z	Thirsteh		gl4, .....yes.
2005-05-22T11:23:00.000Z	Thirsteh		gl4, I/O error, I can't even press the eject button on my cdrom
2005-05-22T11:23:00.000Z	Thirsteh		I'm talking about the eject button on the actual drive
2005-05-22T11:24:00.000Z	linux_galore	Thirsteh	if you cant eject it that means an app has locked it
2005-05-22T11:24:00.000Z	Thirsteh	linux_galore	no, it doesn't, it's unmounted.
2005-05-22T11:25:00.000Z	linux_galore	Thirsteh	so you did umount /dev/cdrom
2005-05-22T11:25:00.000Z	linux_galore	Thirsteh	type  eject
2005-05-22T11:25:00.000Z	Thirsteh	linux_galore	lol :P
2005-05-22T11:26:00.000Z	Thirsteh	linux_galore	I'm not stupid, it's an I/O error. There's nothing that will make my CD drive eject. And no, 'eject -r' doesn't work, neither does forcefully unmount it, cause it's mountable and unmountable, but not ejectable.
2005-05-22T11:26:00.000Z	linux_galore	Thirsteh	do you have a master reset on the drive....usually a small hole on the front
2005-05-22T11:33:00.000Z	Thirsteh	linux_galore	you live in China?
2005-05-22T12:50:00.000Z	Thirsteh	linux_galore	well, the way I get it, Kubuntu is the "alternative", not the "real thing" ... :S
2005-05-22T12:51:00.000Z	linux_galore	Thirsteh	yes but KDE is still the most prefered desktop so saying Ubuntu is GTK only is a bit dumb from a corp point of view and a community point of view
2005-05-22T12:53:00.000Z	Thirsteh	linux_galore	that's why they created Kubuntu, but you can't expect that Kubuntu is 100% like Ubuntu, when Ubuntu is the main project
2005-05-22T12:54:00.000Z	linux_galore	Thirsteh	Im very familair with kde's underside doesnt matter what distro you give me i totally change kde into a different beast.....I dont even use the kicker task bar I use KXdocker....KXdocker works 95% like OSX's docker even has the animations
2005-05-22T12:55:00.000Z	linux_galore	Thirsteh	people see my Kubuntu install and wonder how I got OSX running on a IBM T23 laptop
