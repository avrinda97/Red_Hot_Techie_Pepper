2005-04-29T15:04:00.000Z	forsaker8k6		mm.. about evince: it doesn't seem to be so different to gpdf or similiars

2005-04-29T15:06:00.000Z	Burgundavia	forsaker8k6	evince is built on a new framework for pdf, one that uses a common backend for it and kpdf
2005-04-29T15:07:00.000Z	forsaker8k6	Burgundavia	mmm.. i see
2005-04-29T15:07:00.000Z	Burgundavia	forsaker8k6	the backend is called libpoppler, it is a freedesktop.org project
2005-05-13T13:10:00.000Z	Burgundavia	forsaker8k6	ubuntu is a fork, but is also tries to give back as much as possible, as soon as possible
2005-05-13T13:12:00.000Z	Burgundavia	forsaker8k6	I gather you read the ian murdock thing?
2005-05-13T13:12:00.000Z	Burgundavia	forsaker8k6	remember, ubuntu syncs to sid, not sarge
2005-05-13T13:12:00.000Z	Burgundavia	forsaker8k6	there are things on sid that don't install on sarge
2005-05-13T13:13:00.000Z	Burgundavia	forsaker8k6	there are legit concerns
2005-05-13T13:13:00.000Z	Burgundavia	forsaker8k6	but ubuntu is being pretty good about staying true to the debian core
