2010-10-18T00:59:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Skaperen	to create DVD Video disks I've personally had the most luck with DeVeDe (it's in default repo)
2011-05-30T05:17:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Skaperen	I'd try booting with the nomodeset option, see if that makes any difference.  Good luck.
2011-05-30T05:17:00.000Z	Skaperen	ZykoticK9	how to do that?
2011-05-30T05:18:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Skaperen	press a button (space maybe) at the first graphic of the LiveCD then I think you get an F6 option for boot options - nomodeset is in there.
2011-05-30T05:18:00.000Z	Skaperen	ZykoticK9	OK ... I'll go back to 11.04 and try that
2011-05-30T05:27:00.000Z	Skaperen	ZykoticK9	no go ... once I ran the installer, it goes to where it asks if I want third party software, I click forward, and then it's hung right there, just as before
2011-05-30T05:27:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Skaperen	sorry, I don't have any other suggestions.  Best of luck.
2011-05-30T05:28:00.000Z	Skaperen	ZykoticK9	I guess I'll just have to ask on the forums
2011-05-30T07:11:00.000Z	Skaperen	ZykoticK9	I found the problem ... the Ubuntu installer does not support GPT partition table
2011-05-30T07:12:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Skaperen	good work man.  I'm not even sure what GPT partitions are.  Glad you figured it out!
2011-05-30T07:13:00.000Z	Skaperen	ZykoticK9	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUID_Partition_Table
2011-05-30T07:13:00.000Z	Skaperen	ZykoticK9	it's a requirement for drives (or RAID array created big drives) larger than 2TB
2011-05-30T07:14:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Skaperen	are you using Apple hardware by chance?
2011-05-30T07:14:00.000Z	Skaperen	ZykoticK9	no
2011-05-30T07:15:00.000Z	Skaperen	ZykoticK9	my drive is only 1TB ... just a cheap $300 box ... but I used GPT to get lots of partitions to make it a multiboot machine
2011-05-30T07:16:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Skaperen	GPT is certainly not required for multiboot...
2011-05-30T07:16:00.000Z	Skaperen	ZykoticK9	no, but it is a lot easier when you are setting up 53 partitions
2011-05-30T07:18:00.000Z	Skaperen	ZykoticK9	I worked around it by re-partitioning with MBR, giving it just the 4 partitions it will have ... I backed up the GPT and will restore it when done
2011-05-30T07:18:00.000Z	Skaperen	ZykoticK9	at the same sectors, of course
