2005-05-16T16:20:00.000Z	Tallia1		hey guys, i've to ask you a question.. what does imply to create a link to a folder in /bin? example: "andrea@taglia:/bin$ ln -s /usr/java/bin java" ??
2005-05-16T16:21:00.000Z	topyli	Tallia1	well, then you have a link in /usr/bin that's all
2005-05-16T16:21:00.000Z	topyli	Tallia1	which is good if you want to have java in your path
2005-05-16T16:22:00.000Z	Tallia1		but it isn't the same to add a export $/usr/java/jre1.5.0_02/bin
2005-05-16T16:22:00.000Z	Tallia1		to the bash.bashrc file!?
2005-05-16T16:23:00.000Z	topyli	Tallia1	no it's not
2005-05-16T16:23:00.000Z	Tallia1		why!?
2005-05-16T16:23:00.000Z	Tallia1		i wanna to know why!! :)
2005-05-16T16:23:00.000Z	Tallia1		i wanna know why!! :) :)
2005-05-16T16:23:00.000Z	topyli	Tallia1	in bashrc, you add directories to your path. with the link, you add the link to your current path
2005-05-16T16:24:00.000Z	Tallia1		i haven't understand..
2005-05-16T16:25:00.000Z	topyli	Tallia1	either mohammed goes to the mountain, or the mountain comes to mohammed you know :)
2005-05-16T16:25:00.000Z	Tallia1		.. ;|
2005-05-16T16:26:00.000Z	Tallia1	topyli	why i have to do both the operations in order to make java operative?
2005-05-16T16:26:00.000Z	topyli	Tallia1	ah, you're probably setting the $JAVA_HOME variable in bashrc, and the link is just to find the binary
2005-05-16T16:26:00.000Z	topyli		which is not the same thing, again :)
2005-05-16T16:27:00.000Z	Tallia1		nope.. look at this page http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/AddingJavaSupport
2005-05-16T16:27:00.000Z	Tallia1		the $JAVA_HOME is created in the bashrc file too
2005-05-16T16:29:00.000Z	topyli	Tallia1	ok, step 3. that's so that your shell finds java. the link is probably for scripts and possibly the mozilla plugin
