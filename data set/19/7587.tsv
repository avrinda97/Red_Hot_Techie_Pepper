2007-07-29T07:56:00.000Z	marcz	dystopianray	I just bought packetpenguin.net and want to have a FQDN for my boxes, how do i go about that?
2007-07-29T07:57:00.000Z	dystopianray	marcz	are you going to be pointing your domain at your boxes?
2007-07-29T07:57:00.000Z	marcz	dystopianray	what do you man?
2007-07-29T07:58:00.000Z	dystopianray	marcz	is your domain going to be pointing at your network?
2007-07-29T07:58:00.000Z	dystopianray	marcz	are you marchines going to be accessible from the internet using your new domain?
2007-07-29T07:59:00.000Z	marcz	dystopianray	just the web/mail and ftp boxes
2007-07-29T08:00:00.000Z	marcz	dystopianray	so where do I have to make the domain changes/
2007-07-29T08:00:00.000Z	dystopianray	marcz	just point your domains A records at your ip address
2007-07-29T08:00:00.000Z	marcz	dystopianray	already done that
2007-07-29T08:00:00.000Z	dystopianray	marcz	forward the necessary ports to the correct machine and you're pretty much done
2007-07-29T08:01:00.000Z	marcz	dystopianray	I dont have to worry about the domain name invalid entry in admin>networking?
2007-07-29T08:01:00.000Z	dystopianray	marcz	shouldn't have to
2007-07-29T08:02:00.000Z	dystopianray	marcz	you don't need to be using the domain in your internal lan
2007-07-29T08:02:00.000Z	dystopianray	marcz	it'll only be useful for external access
2007-07-29T08:02:00.000Z	marcz	dystopianray	ok , thanks, i just am getting readyto set up postfix and was not sure about the FQDN
2007-07-29T08:03:00.000Z	dystopianray	marcz	i don't know anything about setting up postfix, only sendmail
2007-07-29T08:05:00.000Z	dystopianray	marcz	should be able to just point an MX record at your mail server, then postfix likely has an option in it's config to set the FQDN
