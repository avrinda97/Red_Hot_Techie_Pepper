2011-05-04T18:40:00.000Z	fredrik__		how do I create a "launcher" that act likes an installed app in Unity? Ie when I browse installed apps I want to se the launcher
2011-05-04T18:41:00.000Z	syockit	fredrik__	it's probably a .desktop entry
2011-05-04T18:41:00.000Z	syockit	fredrik__	maybe quite tricky to find tutorial for that one, seeing google doesn't recognize the .
2011-05-04T18:42:00.000Z	syockit	fredrik__	if you "ls /usr/share/applications" you get a list of system-installed .desktop files
2011-05-04T18:42:00.000Z	fredrik__	syockit	But how can I make it act like a "installed app"? can I make unity find it to launch it. I dont want to pin it to the launcher.. I dont use it that often..
2011-05-04T18:43:00.000Z	syockit	fredrik__	if you want to make your own, put it in "~/.local/share/applications"
2011-05-04T18:43:00.000Z	fredrik__	syockit	I just want to be able to browse it whitout looking up the exe file in nautilus everytime I want to start it
2011-05-04T18:44:00.000Z	syockit	fredrik__	hence the .desktop file
2011-05-04T18:44:00.000Z	syockit	fredrik__	I'm pretty sure Unity also searches it
2011-05-04T18:44:00.000Z	fredrik__	syockit	Ok. Think I understand... its not easy this... In Gnome all wine apps was installed to the startmenu in wine folder
2011-05-04T18:47:00.000Z	fredrik__	syockit	Ok, in my .local/share/applications I have a bunch of files like: wine-extension-gif.desktop nothing more... What should I put here?
2011-05-04T18:48:00.000Z	syockit	fredrik__	first let's confirm whether it finds the .desktop entry or not. gedit that wine-extension-gif.desktop and check its name. Then use unity's finder to find it. Is it able to find?
2011-05-04T18:48:00.000Z	fredrik__	syockit	sorry.. there was a folder called wine and in that one lays my windows app.. Still.. unity cant find my windows app.. still lost..
2011-05-04T18:49:00.000Z	syockit	fredrik__	I just restarted my unity-applications-daemon and it manages to find my custom .desktop. So I suppose it works. After making one .desktop file, you may have to relogin
2011-05-04T18:50:00.000Z	fredrik__	syockit	ok.. Im trying to relogin then
2011-05-04T18:50:00.000Z	syockit	fredrik__	do you already have the .desktop entry?
2011-05-04T18:51:00.000Z	fredrik__	syockit	yes. In a subfolder of the .local/share/applications lays a .desktop file for my windows app
2011-05-04T18:51:00.000Z	fredrik__	syockit	rebooting.. brb
2011-05-04T18:51:00.000Z	syockit	fredrik__	okay go on and relogin, then try to find that file
