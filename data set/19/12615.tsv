2005-08-10T09:27:00.000Z	Evil		hello
2005-08-10T09:27:00.000Z	Evil		how can we reinstall french keyboard layout please
2005-08-10T09:28:00.000Z	jowi	Evil	you want the keyboard layout for a specific user ?
2005-08-10T09:29:00.000Z	Evil	jowi	i want back my french layout but i can't find it
2005-08-10T09:29:00.000Z	jowi	Evil	I have a french install for ubuntu but uses a swedish keyboard in my session by adding "setxkbmap se" to ~/.xinitrc
2005-08-10T09:29:00.000Z	jowi	Evil	oh.
2005-08-10T09:30:00.000Z	jowi	Evil	you can set it in gnome-keyboard-properties
2005-08-10T09:31:00.000Z	jowi	Evil	"Agencements" and press the "default" tickbox
2005-08-10T09:31:00.000Z	jowi	Evil	you have the french keyboard available in gnome-keyboard-settings?
2005-08-10T09:32:00.000Z	jowi	Evil	"gnome-keyboard-properties" i mean
2005-08-10T09:34:00.000Z	jowi	Evil	what happens when you click "add"?
2005-08-10T09:35:00.000Z	jowi	Evil	then i think you could run "dpkg-reconfigure locales" to set up the language if i am not mistaken (please someone correct me if i am wrong)
2005-08-10T09:41:00.000Z	jowi	Evil	I have no idea what that is. try just to type in a terminal: "setxkbmap fr" and see if that works for you.
2005-08-10T09:42:00.000Z	jowi	Evil	so that is the problem.
2005-08-10T09:42:00.000Z	jowi	Evil	hang on
2005-08-10T09:44:00.000Z	jowi	Evil	sudo apt-get install language-pack-fr-base language-pack-fr
2005-08-10T09:50:00.000Z	jowi	Evil	did it do the trick?
2005-08-10T09:51:00.000Z	jowi	Evil	ok. then you go into gnome-keyboard-properties and set the keyboard type so it matches yours (usually 105 keys or something)
2005-08-10T09:52:00.000Z	jowi	Evil	i need to be on my way. if you need help in french you can have a look in #ubuntu-fr channel
