2008-01-06T08:49:00.000Z	Xintruder		guys, does you tube movies appear in less quality than windows with ubuntu codecs, or is it just me?
2008-01-06T08:51:00.000Z	Xintruder		guys i think video quality with ubuntu is lesser than windows, is that correct or me mistaken?
2008-01-06T08:51:00.000Z	tritium	Xintruder	mistaken, as the visual quality is hardware-dependent.
2008-01-06T08:51:00.000Z	tritium	Xintruder	codec issues are another matter...
2008-01-06T08:51:00.000Z	Xintruder	tritium	my hardware were fine with vista installed >< !

2008-01-06T08:53:00.000Z	Xintruder	tritium	i believe the quality i see in youtube clips are lower quality, pixels and colors
2008-01-06T08:54:00.000Z	tritium	Xintruder	linux flash support isn't where it should be

2008-01-06T08:57:00.000Z	tritium	Xintruder	my point was that flash support on linux is behind that on windows and mac
