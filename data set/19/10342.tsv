2006-08-09T11:48:00.000Z	azureal		well, if you set up your sources to include Universal, you should be seeing skype w/ apt-get
2006-08-09T11:49:00.000Z	gnomefreak	azureal	it better not be in universe
2006-08-09T11:50:00.000Z	azureal	gnomefreak	what?!
2006-08-09T11:51:00.000Z	azureal	gnomefreak	 what do you mean, "better"... perhaps it's better to live under a rock?
2006-08-09T11:51:00.000Z	gnomefreak	azureal	if skype is in your repos than you are not using official repos
2006-08-09T11:51:00.000Z	gnomefreak	azureal	if it was added to universe people would be in trouble
2006-08-09T11:52:00.000Z	azureal	gnomefreak	ok, i don't know the specifics of this particular program (which exact repo controls it)... i just assumed that he had only the defaults checked off, and didnt have Universal checked
2006-08-10T13:43:00.000Z	azureal	gnomefreak	how's gnome treating you?
2006-08-10T13:44:00.000Z	gnomefreak	azureal	dont know havent seen gnome in a few days
