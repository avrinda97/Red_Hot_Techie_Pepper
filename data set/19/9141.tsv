2006-12-20T10:32:00.000Z	elysium444		thanks
2006-12-20T10:33:00.000Z	elysium444		ok I will check
2006-12-20T10:35:00.000Z	Rookie_	elysium444	- this is one way to forward ports within the script - http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/38040/
2006-12-20T10:40:00.000Z	elysium444	Rookie_	I had the problem before testing the script
2006-12-20T10:40:00.000Z	elysium444	Rookie_	I thought the script would solve it
2006-12-20T10:41:00.000Z	Rookie_	elysium444	- depence on how you connect to the net ...
2006-12-20T10:45:00.000Z	Rookie_	elysium444	- i guess you have a router, check the rules in the router, if nothing wrong with the rules then flush the iptables rules ( iptables -F ) and run the sc ript you want
2006-12-20T10:48:00.000Z	Rookie_	elysium444	- you see it says "iptables" in the beginin of each row ? but the system dont know where that is, you have to set up a path for that ... and you need paths and definition for each NIC / eth too
2006-12-20T10:58:00.000Z	Rookie_	elysium444	- wrote you an answer
2006-12-20T10:59:00.000Z	Rookie_	elysium444	- want to learn more about iptables and how it works? www.iptables.org
2006-12-20T11:03:00.000Z	Rookie_	elysium444	- you have to spec your internal ip, if you use the puter as a gateway too you need to spec both nics
2006-12-20T11:05:00.000Z	Rookie_	elysium444	- you wan to take the shortcut, try this - http://easyfwgen.morizot.net/gen/
2006-12-20T11:07:00.000Z	elysium444	Rookie_	ok thanks, I didnt know. I will do some learning. Enjoy your coffe
