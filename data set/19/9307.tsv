2008-10-04T20:01:00.000Z	Dragan91		what is best partition to install ubuntu on? ext3?
2008-10-04T20:02:00.000Z	Dragan91		Photon why ext2?
2008-10-04T20:02:00.000Z	Dragan91		photon is there any difrence between ext2 and 3 when OS is installed on it?
2008-10-04T20:03:00.000Z	hyperair	Dragan91	journaling. ext3 has it, ext2 doesn't. it means that you can go through a power cut without having to run a disk check
2008-10-04T20:04:00.000Z	hyperair	Dragan91	no, not such a stark difference
2008-10-04T20:05:00.000Z	hyperair	Dragan91	ext2 >>>>> fat32, ext3 >> ntfs,
2008-10-04T20:06:00.000Z	hyperair	Dragan91	from what i hear you can get it from system->administration->hardware drivers
2008-10-04T20:06:00.000Z	hyperair	Dragan91	or at least that's what my ex-classmate said
2008-10-04T20:07:00.000Z	hyperair	Dragan91	have fun
2008-10-04T20:11:00.000Z	hyperair	Dragan91	are you in a console or in a GUi environment?
2008-10-04T20:11:00.000Z	hyperair	Dragan91	is the terminal in a GUI environment or is the whole screen the terminal?
2008-10-04T20:12:00.000Z	hyperair	Dragan91	well, what erUSUL said. :0.0 is the default display, you can see it in "echo $DISPLAY"
