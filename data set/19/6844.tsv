2008-08-26T04:36:00.000Z	qwstar		how do I resize my LVM partitions? I want to shrink the / filesystem and make a separate /home partition, then upgrade to (reinstall) 64-bit ubuntu in /
2008-08-26T04:37:00.000Z	Kuwanger	qwstar	What filesystem type is /?
2008-08-26T04:37:00.000Z	qwstar	Kuwanger	ext3
2008-08-26T04:37:00.000Z	Kuwanger	qwstar	Are you using any features of ext3 beyond journaling?
2008-08-26T04:38:00.000Z	qwstar	Kuwanger	features such as what?
2008-08-26T04:38:00.000Z	Kuwanger	qwstar	Extended attributes..which I guess ext2 can have too.
2008-08-26T04:39:00.000Z	Kuwanger	qwstar	My overall question is based on that you need to resize the filesystem first, then you can use lvm tools to shrink the container.
2008-08-26T04:40:00.000Z	Kuwanger	qwstar	And since you're wanting to resize /, you'll need to use a livecd/recovercd with a resizer.
2008-08-26T04:40:00.000Z	qwstar	Kuwanger	I tried using GParted from the PartedMagic livecd, but it did not recognize the LVM partition
2008-08-26T04:42:00.000Z	Kuwanger	qwstar	From a quick glance, it looks like partedmagic might not support lvm.
2008-08-26T04:44:00.000Z	qwstar	Kuwanger	what would you recommend?
2008-08-26T04:44:00.000Z	Kuwanger	qwstar	Ah..even futher: "GParted does not support logical volume management (LVM) at present, although this feature has been requested[3] by many users and may be implemented in a future release."
2008-08-26T04:45:00.000Z	qwstar	Kuwanger	would the Kubuntu live CD work?
2008-08-26T04:46:00.000Z	Kuwanger	qwstar	I'm not sure.  I don't know what files it includes.
2008-08-26T04:46:00.000Z	Kuwanger	qwstar	Mount it and check if it has resize2fs.
2008-08-26T04:46:00.000Z	Kuwanger	qwstar	I've used resize2fs in the past and it's worked fine.
2008-08-26T04:47:00.000Z	Kuwanger	qwstar	If you go that approach, you'll want to resize your / down by some amount (say 1.5GB), shrink its container (by say 1GB), then resize again to enlarge to take up all the available space.
2008-08-26T04:48:00.000Z	Kuwanger	qwstar	At least, that seems to be the recommended safest approach.
2008-08-26T04:54:00.000Z	Kuwanger	qwstar	Good luck.
