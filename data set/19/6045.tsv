2008-03-23T22:30:00.000Z	Infernalord	Flannel	you want to restore the windows loader to the mbr?
2008-03-23T22:30:00.000Z	Flannel	Infernalord	He wants to get rid ofUbuntu, so yes.
2008-03-23T22:31:00.000Z	Flannel	Infernalord	He has no windows CD
2008-03-23T22:33:00.000Z	Flannel	Infernalord	What's your problem with dualboot?
2008-03-23T22:34:00.000Z	Infernalord	Flannel	I had windows installed, and yesterday I installed the newest Ubuntu, but when I reboot the pc, it goes straight for Windows, it won't let me choose and I don't know how to make it work
2008-03-23T22:37:00.000Z	Flannel	Infernalord	Try the first link there, it gives instructions on (re)installing GRUB to the MBR
2008-03-23T22:37:00.000Z	Infernalord	Flannel	I have been there, the problem is that I don't know the commands like setup(0,0) i don't know how to configure those commands
2008-03-23T22:38:00.000Z	Flannel	Infernalord	What do you mean?  Its just a partition number.  The first is the drive number, second is partition.  So, 0,0 would be your first drive, first partition (sda1 equivalent in linux)
2008-03-23T22:39:00.000Z	Infernalord	Flannel	I have 2 hard drives, one IDE and one SATA, how do I know which partition I should tell grub to boot? when I installed ubuntu, i created one swap partition and one ext3, do i need another one?
2008-03-23T22:40:00.000Z	Infernalord	Flannel	I remember that my ext3 partition was on sdb, the sata drive
2008-03-23T22:41:00.000Z	Flannel	Infernalord	No, you don't need another.  GRUB (stage 1, the MBR bit) installs to your first harddrive (since thats what your BIOS boots to), it doesn't have a partition.  You tell GRUB to boot to the partition that your /boot directory is in (whether thats /boot independant of something else, or inside of /)
2008-03-23T22:42:00.000Z	Infernalord	Flannel	i see, is there a way of seeing a map of the partitions while on the grub prompt? so that i know which one to type on the setup (x,x) ?
2008-03-23T22:45:00.000Z	Flannel	Infernalord	Not while at the GRUB prompt, I don't believe, no.  If you (on your harddrive) check out /boot/grub/device.map, it should list them.  (Thats the one on your harddrive, not actually at '/boot/grub/device.map', since you're on a liveCD
2008-03-23T22:46:00.000Z	Infernalord	Flannel	Ok I will search for that, so afterwards all I need to do is enter the grub prompt and type setup (x,x) and reboot?
2008-03-23T22:47:00.000Z	Flannel	Infernalord	just follow the steps on that page, yeah.
2008-03-23T22:49:00.000Z	Infernalord	Flannel	I will try that now, I should be online in a few minutes. Thank you for your patience.
2008-03-23T23:27:00.000Z	Infernalord	Flannel	I tried but I couldn't get it to work :( I wrote setup (1,2) and it would give me "error 11" :( wanna see a paste of the terminal?
2008-03-23T23:40:00.000Z	Flannel	Infernalord	even.
2008-03-23T23:41:00.000Z	Infernalord	Flannel	 i will try
