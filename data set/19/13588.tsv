2005-12-12T09:13:00.000Z	shadeofgrey	fr500	 did you do distro-upgrade and all that stuff?
2005-12-12T09:13:00.000Z	fr500	shadeofgrey	no, it is a clean breezy install
2005-12-12T09:14:00.000Z	shadeofgrey	fr500	 if thats how you upgraded to breezy i highly recommend blowing away yourentire installation and starting from scratch
