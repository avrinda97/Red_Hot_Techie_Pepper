2009-02-11T15:54:00.000Z	ociugi		why is it root access in ubuntu is off by default?
2009-02-11T15:55:00.000Z	Tyrath	ociugi	I don't get what you mean, off by default
2009-02-11T15:57:00.000Z	Tyrath	ociugi	have you tried sudo su ?
2009-02-11T15:57:00.000Z	Tyrath	ociugi	that puts you into root
2009-02-11T15:57:00.000Z	Tyrath	ociugi	and if you're lazy bind an alias and stick it in .bash_aliases
2009-02-11T15:58:00.000Z	Tyrath	ociugi	do you know how to use vim?
2009-02-11T15:59:00.000Z	Tyrath	ociugi	ok, well if you open up .bashrc in vim, you will see a line where the link to .bash_aliases is commented out (ie, is surrounded by # characters)
2009-02-11T16:00:00.000Z	Tyrath	ociugi	after you have uncommented the # characters surrounding the file link type :w! to save
2009-02-11T16:00:00.000Z	Tyrath	ociugi	then exit
2009-02-11T16:03:00.000Z	Tyrath	ociugi	when trying to talk to me, please type Tyr then hit the tab key, it will highlight your phrases for me so I can locate them more easily
2009-02-11T16:03:00.000Z	Tyrath	ociugi	so after you have uncommented the lines in the .bashrc file
2009-02-11T16:03:00.000Z	Tyrath	ociugi	you will make a new file called .bash_aliases
2009-02-11T16:04:00.000Z	Tyrath	ociugi	you do that by typing wine .bash_aliases in a terminal
2009-02-11T16:04:00.000Z	Tyrath	ociugi	then when inside the file you need to type :w! to save it
2009-02-11T16:05:00.000Z	Tyrath	ociugi	now, to create an alias type alias <name>="<function>" where <name> is the name you want to type in terminal to execute some command and <function> is the command
2009-02-11T16:05:00.000Z	Tyrath	ociugi	you have you do that in .bash_aliases or .bashrc. Otherwise it will only exist for the session you are in
2009-02-11T16:06:00.000Z	Tyrath	ociugi	basically what that means is if you do it in terminal, but not in vim, the alias will only exist until you shut the terminal
2009-02-11T16:07:00.000Z	Tyrath	ociugi	the .bashrc file contains the settings for what is termed the bourne shell or bash which you use the terminal to interface with
2009-02-11T16:07:00.000Z	Tyrath	ociugi	let me know if you have any problems
