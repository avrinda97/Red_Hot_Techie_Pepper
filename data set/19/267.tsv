2012-10-06T09:03:00.000Z	theadmin	williamherry	Tell us what it does
2012-10-06T09:03:00.000Z	williamherry	theadmin	quick switch application
2012-10-06T09:04:00.000Z	theadmin	williamherry	Err... uh... I'm not sure I understand, like, Alt-Tab?
2012-10-06T09:04:00.000Z	williamherry	theadmin	some key weak it up and type a few work of application to switch to that app
2012-10-06T09:05:00.000Z	theadmin	williamherry	Oh that, sure, just hit the Super key (normally has a Windows logo on it) and start typing
2012-10-06T09:05:00.000Z	theadmin	williamherry	That's in Ubuntu though, doesn't work in variants
2012-10-06T09:07:00.000Z	williamherry	theadmin	similar but that thing in ubuntu is more like to launch app, I want if one already launched, switch to it, if not, launch,
2012-10-06T09:07:00.000Z	theadmin	williamherry	I think it does that
2012-10-06T09:08:00.000Z	williamherry	theadmin	really, didn't know that, how to make it switch not launch?
2012-10-06T09:09:00.000Z	theadmin	williamherry	I'm not sure, I don't use it to be honest, doesn't it do that by default? I always thought it does but I never really checkee
