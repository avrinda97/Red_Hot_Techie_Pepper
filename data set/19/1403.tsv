2011-04-14T18:27:00.000Z	MonkeyDust		dist-upgrade
2011-04-14T18:27:00.000Z	Pici	MonkeyDust	no. Thats not what a dist-upgrade is for.
2011-05-05T17:22:00.000Z	Pici	MonkeyDust	what was that for?
2011-05-31T21:21:00.000Z	Pici	MonkeyDust	!pamerr or !pamerror
2011-09-14T16:06:00.000Z	Pici	MonkeyDust	It is perfectly safe.
2011-09-14T16:08:00.000Z	Pici	MonkeyDust	Younder: There is nothing inherently unsafe about forwarding port 80.  If your website itself is insecure, then thats a whole different issue.
2011-12-01T01:26:00.000Z	Pici	MonkeyDust	no please do not join #ubuntu-offtopic for that kind of chat
2011-12-01T01:26:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	Pici	 you're right
2011-12-06T22:52:00.000Z	Pici	MonkeyDust	He wants to use gnome 2.
2012-01-26T19:36:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	Pici	 "#network Channel is open." :)
2012-02-07T21:15:00.000Z	Pici	MonkeyDust	:P
2012-02-09T21:22:00.000Z	Pici	MonkeyDust	You'll probably want to ask in #freenode if you are being denied a connection.
2012-02-09T21:23:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	Pici	yes, but then there's still the mailclient issue
2012-03-27T22:49:00.000Z	Pici	MonkeyDust	tsk
2012-05-02T16:24:00.000Z	Pici	MonkeyDust	Perhaps there is an alternatives entry for wine?
2012-06-13T19:23:00.000Z	Pici	MonkeyDust	he was asking about irssi logs
2012-08-07T16:11:00.000Z	Pici	MonkeyDust	write one, and we'll use it.
2012-08-21T19:07:00.000Z	Pici	MonkeyDust	what? No. #ubuntu-offtopic is not a support channel, nor does it handle documentation issues.
2012-10-29T19:46:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	Pici	 was faster :)
