2006-08-05T13:03:00.000Z	nicholaspaul		Q: I'm trying to copy everything from my system drive to a blank drive, and when I use cp -rv * /media/other, it gets stuck at copying 'proc/kmsg'... just pauses for a really long time. Is there a reason for that, or a better way to duplicate the entire system?

2006-08-05T14:28:00.000Z	nicholaspaul	fyrestrtr	i followed the grub HOWTO, first of all i just got the word GRUB on the screen, wouldnt boot.Copying grub from the old to new drive wont work?
2006-08-05T14:28:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	nicholaspaul	no, you just need to set it up, grub-install /dev/whateveristhebootdrive
2006-08-05T14:29:00.000Z	nicholaspaul	fyrestrtr	 oh i see. tanks!
2006-08-05T14:30:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	nicholaspaul	are you running xgl?
2006-08-05T14:31:00.000Z	nicholaspaul	fyrestrtr	 wassat? I dont think i am ...
2006-08-05T14:31:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	nicholaspaul	okay then, ignore what I said :)
2006-08-05T14:39:00.000Z	nicholaspaul	fyrestrtr	i did a sudo grub-install /dev/hdd1 but all i get is GRUB on the screen when i restart... ?
2006-08-05T14:39:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	nicholaspaul	you need to install it on /dev/hdd (if that really is your drive, more than likely, its /dev/hda)
2006-08-05T14:42:00.000Z	nicholaspaul	fyrestrtr	am i going to run into problems when i reorganise the drives ie. the old master gets removed and the new one gets plugged in as Primary Master?
2006-08-05T14:43:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	nicholaspaul	to be honest, you should not -- beyond the fact that if you were auto-mounting your old master, then it would not mount properly, but that is a minor thing.
2006-08-05T14:43:00.000Z	nicholaspaul	fyrestrtr	oh ok.
2006-08-05T14:48:00.000Z	nicholaspaul	fyrestrtr	 is there a config file, like menu.lst, that i can check to see if its going to start up when i switch the drives over?
