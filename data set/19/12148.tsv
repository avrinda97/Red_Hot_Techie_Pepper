2006-03-05T17:54:00.000Z	maxkelley	zax1	it's hard for us to support all devices...
2006-03-05T17:55:00.000Z	maxkelley	zax1	big companies don't make drivers for linux, often.. what is the device?
2006-03-05T17:55:00.000Z	maxkelley	zax1	all I can say is google
2006-03-05T17:56:00.000Z	maxkelley	zax1	what is the brand?
2006-03-05T17:57:00.000Z	maxkelley	zax1	They're fairly cheap.. methinks :)
2006-03-05T17:58:00.000Z	maxkelley	zax1	hire a coder :)
2006-03-05T17:58:00.000Z	maxkelley	zax1	I understand your position
2006-03-05T06:00:00.000Z	maxkelley	zax1	hehe.. you probably won't be able to find one  :)
2006-03-05T06:01:00.000Z	maxkelley	zax1	who isn't? :)
2006-03-05T06:01:00.000Z	maxkelley	zax1	it's hard to find drivers sometimes.. a lot of more hardware should be supported in the next release. hopefully.
2006-03-05T06:02:00.000Z	maxkelley	zax1	it depends how locked up it is.
2006-03-05T06:02:00.000Z	maxkelley	zax1	google for ndiswrapper... it sometimes has help with that.
2006-03-05T06:03:00.000Z	maxkelley	zax1	how secured the manufacturer made it, as in how hard it is to figure out how the insides work.
2006-03-05T06:06:00.000Z	maxkelley	zax1	good to be of any help
