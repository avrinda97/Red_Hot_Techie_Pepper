2011-03-30T15:34:00.000Z	jatt		how can I make an external usb bootable?
2011-03-30T15:34:00.000Z	jatt		I already installed ubuntu on it and I can mount the partitions and run programs from the usb with chroot
2011-03-30T15:36:00.000Z	guampa	jatt	you need to install a bootloader in the usb drive
2011-03-30T15:36:00.000Z	jatt	guampa	you mean grub?
2011-03-30T15:37:00.000Z	jatt	guampa	will try that, I also try to follow: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootFromUSB
2011-03-30T15:37:00.000Z	jatt	guampa	however it seemed to me very complicated, I will try to just install grub and see what happens
2011-03-30T15:38:00.000Z	guampa	jatt	no, its not necessary to chroot to install it
2011-03-30T15:39:00.000Z	jatt	guampa	how can I do it without chroot? I chroot to it and then run apt-get or gnome-session to run graphical programs there
2011-03-30T15:39:00.000Z	guampa	jatt	i think the instructions in that page are grub1, its easier now with grub2
2011-03-30T15:39:00.000Z	jatt	guampa	I see
2011-03-30T15:40:00.000Z	jatt	guampa	will try with grub2, but you mean apt-get install grub from the chroot is not the way to go isn't it?
2011-03-30T15:41:00.000Z	guampa	jatt	it isn't but for other reasons, "apt-get install grub" installs the grub software package in your system, its not for arbitrarily installing grub to some device
2011-03-30T15:41:00.000Z	jatt	guampa	I see, thanks!
2011-03-30T15:42:00.000Z	guampa	jatt	found the grub2 command line to install to usb
2011-03-30T15:43:00.000Z	jatt	guampa	great, can you share it with me :)?
2011-03-30T15:43:00.000Z	jatt	guampa	I just found with google http://www.pendrivelinux.com/install-grub2-on-usb-from-ubuntu-linux/
2011-03-30T15:43:00.000Z	jatt	guampa	is grub-install?
2011-03-30T15:43:00.000Z	guampa	jatt	that's the one :)
2011-03-30T15:44:00.000Z	jatt	guampa	ok, I will try it tonight at home
