2007-06-04T13:15:00.000Z	opapo		gparted says that it can't format a partition because it is "apparently in use by the system"
2007-06-04T13:15:00.000Z	opapo		I don't have it mounted
2007-06-04T13:16:00.000Z	opapo		I am in the Ubuntu partition
2007-06-04T13:16:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	opapo	so you are running from the hdd that you are trying to modify :)
2007-06-04T13:15:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	opapo	are you running from the live cd
2007-06-04T13:16:00.000Z	opapo	Paddy_EIRE	no
2007-06-04T13:17:00.000Z	opapo	Paddy_EIRE	I had Fedora on that partition and now I want to wipe it.
2007-06-04T13:17:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	opapo	have you unmounted that partition
2007-06-04T13:17:00.000Z	opapo	Paddy_EIRE	yes it is unmounted
2007-06-04T13:18:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	opapo	close gparted open a terminal and type sudo umount -a then type gksudo gparted and try again
2007-06-04T13:19:00.000Z	opapo	Paddy_EIRE	won't umount -a unmount all file systems installed?
2007-06-04T13:19:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	opapo	yeah bt you will still be running, and as far as I know it wont impede you in anyway
2007-06-04T13:22:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	opapo	any joy ?
2007-06-04T13:24:00.000Z	opapo	Paddy_EIRE	I get a lot of "device is busy" warnings
2007-06-04T13:24:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	opapo	yeah thats ok
2007-06-04T13:24:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	opapo	did u do "gksudo gparted"
2007-06-04T13:26:00.000Z	opapo	Paddy_EIRE	I did gksudo gparted and it gives me the same error
2007-06-04T13:27:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	opapo	hmm, maybe you should just do it from a live cd much less hassle
2007-06-04T13:28:00.000Z	opapo	Paddy_EIRE	I will try that
