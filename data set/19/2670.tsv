2010-02-06T09:54:00.000Z	unixalot		Lxde is so ugly
2010-02-06T09:54:00.000Z	semitones	unixalot	it really is, but it's slightly faster
2010-02-06T09:56:00.000Z	unixalot	semitones	so ugly.. '
2010-02-06T09:56:00.000Z	semitones	unixalot	the only really "ugly" part I'm finding is their logo, but what did you think?
2010-02-06T09:57:00.000Z	semitones	unixalot	that, and all the config screens are awkward as hell
2010-02-06T09:57:00.000Z	unixalot	semitones	i dont like the gradient of the menu bar
2010-02-06T09:57:00.000Z	semitones	unixalot	good point -- there's also the way the open window tabs are shadowed, and spaced
2010-02-06T09:57:00.000Z	semitones	unixalot	it looks like it could use a few more revisions
2010-02-06T09:57:00.000Z	unixalot	semitones	Yeah, so effin ugly they should spruce it up a tad
2010-02-06T09:58:00.000Z	unixalot	semitones	it is super fast tho, like on a craptop
2010-02-06T09:58:00.000Z	semitones	unixalot	which is what I'm using :)
2010-02-06T10:45:00.000Z	unixalot	semitones	lxde is so ug, stick with gnome
2010-02-06T10:46:00.000Z	semitones	unixalot	but gnome makes firefox go sooo sloooow
2010-02-06T10:46:00.000Z	unixalot	semitones	use chrome
2010-02-06T10:46:00.000Z	semitones	unixalot	I use chrome. same problem
2010-02-06T10:49:00.000Z	semitones	unixalot	you seem to have a very specific criteria for beauty :P
2010-02-06T10:50:00.000Z	semitones	unixalot	but I agree, kde doesn't look very pretty imo
2010-02-06T10:50:00.000Z	unixalot	semitones	and gnome-do, not that you cant run it in kde
2010-02-06T10:56:00.000Z	semitones	unixalot	I just asked him that :)
