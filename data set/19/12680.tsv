2005-07-25T09:35:00.000Z	aio	Toasta	so what's it doing?
2005-07-25T09:35:00.000Z	aio	Toasta	sorry if you mentioned above....
2005-07-25T09:35:00.000Z	aio	Toasta	have you modified your xorg.conf?
2005-07-25T09:36:00.000Z	aio	Toasta	if you're going to run fglrx, i'd recommend getting the latest from ati.
2005-07-25T09:39:00.000Z	aio	Toasta	so you need to update your xorg.conf file to reflect the fglrx package you've installed.
2005-07-25T09:40:00.000Z	aio	Toasta	i think fglrxconfig is a gui configuration tool to run some utilities
2005-07-25T09:40:00.000Z	aio	Toasta	but i don't think it'll change your xorg.conf file....i may be wrong.  lemme check...
2005-07-25T09:41:00.000Z	aio	Toasta	you're right - i was thinking ati control center.
2005-07-25T09:41:00.000Z	aio	Toasta	i modified mine by hand.  does it modify your xorg.conf.
2005-07-25T09:42:00.000Z	aio	Toasta	?
2005-07-25T09:42:00.000Z	aio	Toasta	errors on installing the fglrx stuff or on trying to create the xorg.conf?
2005-07-25T09:43:00.000Z	aio	Toasta	what errors are you getting?
2005-07-25T09:44:00.000Z	aio	Toasta	how are you trying to install?  through apt-get or synaptic (or some other)?
2005-07-25T09:46:00.000Z	Toasta	aio	will you be here awhile, i need to go take care of something, just a min
2005-07-25T09:46:00.000Z	aio	Toasta	ok - are you sure you want to install the ati drivers from ati and not the package installed with hoary
