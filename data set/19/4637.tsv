2008-12-17T16:54:00.000Z	tiyowan	terryx	Are you doing this through System -> Admin. -> Hardware Drivers?
2008-12-17T16:55:00.000Z	tiyowan	terryx	Hmm...okay...now could you *go* to Hardware Drivers and check if the nvidia drivers are activated?
2008-12-17T16:57:00.000Z	tiyowan	terryx	As long as there is a platform, someone, somewhere will try to install Linux on it. Even if it only boots. :-)
2008-12-17T16:58:00.000Z	tiyowan	terryx	Right.
2008-12-17T16:59:00.000Z	tiyowan	terryx	Ok wait, and let it do its work.
2008-12-17T17:02:00.000Z	tiyowan	terryx	Hmm. Cancel. Reboot and try to enable your effects.
2008-12-18T15:33:00.000Z	tiyowan	terryx	What was the model of your video card again?
2008-12-18T15:33:00.000Z	tiyowan	terryx	nvidia and? model? As in Radeon, Geforce etc.
2008-12-22T14:11:00.000Z	tiyowan	terryx	Are you using Wine to run utorrent?
2008-12-22T14:12:00.000Z	tiyowan	terryx	Um, is there any particular reason why can't use a native torrent client for linux?
2008-12-22T14:14:00.000Z	tiyowan	terryx	There's lots of them. bittornado, deluge, ktorrent, rtorrent, etc.
2008-12-22T14:15:00.000Z	tiyowan	terryx	Personally, transmission does the job for me.
2008-12-22T16:01:00.000Z	tiyowan	terryx	You dual-booting Windows?
2008-12-22T16:02:00.000Z	tiyowan	terryx	Copy your /var/log/Xorg.0.log and paste it into paste.ubuntu.com.
