2007-08-20T09:04:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	garrettt	go to the link above, download the .deb for pidgin, uninstall gaim, then install pidgin by double clicking the .deb
2007-08-20T09:05:00.000Z	garrettt	IndyGunFreak	thanks a lot
2007-08-20T09:05:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	garrettt	no sweat
2007-08-20T09:10:00.000Z	garrettt	IndyGunFreak	hey i really hate to bother you again but i just started up the .deb file and it says "Error: wrong architecture 'amd64' " does this mean i can't install it :/
2007-08-20T09:11:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	garrettt	yes... yuou didn' say you were using 64bit.
2007-08-20T09:13:00.000Z	garrettt	IndyGunFreak	thats because i didn't know haha but this means i am stuck with Gaim
2007-08-20T09:14:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	garrettt	or try to compile it for 64bit...
2007-08-20T09:14:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	garrettt	or do what you're probably gonna end up doing anyways, download and install 32bit.
2007-08-20T09:15:00.000Z	garrettt	IndyGunFreak	i just tried both and they both had the same error
2007-08-20T09:16:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	garrettt	tried both?
2007-08-20T09:16:00.000Z	garrettt	IndyGunFreak	yeah the 64 and 32 bit .deb files
2007-08-20T09:17:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	garrettt	and wha ti actually meant, is what you're gonna do eventually anyways, download the 32bit Feisty, and reinstall ubuntu 32bit... and ditch 64bit
2007-08-20T09:18:00.000Z	garrettt	IndyGunFreak	oo i see ok well thanks for your time sorry for bothering you with my lack of knowledge
2007-08-20T09:18:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	garrettt	youd idn't bother me at all... its just 64bit is a pain in the rump w/ ubuntu... its really not quite ready yet
