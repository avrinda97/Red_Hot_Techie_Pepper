2011-10-15T05:47:00.000Z	aioe		I am guessing this is some kind of framebuffer issue and appending vga=normal to grub seems to have worked, so again, how do I change the grub command line perminantly?
2011-10-15T05:48:00.000Z	velociostrich	aioe	Oooh, take a look at the grub wiki docs, it's rather different from the old menu.lst days and I can't remember
2011-10-15T05:49:00.000Z	aioe	velociostrich	yeah thats how far I know the subject ;
2011-10-15T06:14:00.000Z	velociostrich	aioe	Ibis: I had the same exact gripe. With GNOME 2's menus, it's just Applications->Category->App, no waiting for some silly search then having to wade through massive 128x128 icons
2011-10-15T06:15:00.000Z	velociostrich	aioe	Ibis: The company I work for has a few older machines that I have LTS ubuntu on, and while they could run Gnome 2, there's no way they could handle that
2011-10-15T06:15:00.000Z	aioe	velociostrich	well I'd be embracing it as a wonderful innovation if it werent for the fact  gnome's regular interface is broken in at least nautilus and gnome-panel if not other places I didnt have time to explore because I had to get something that worked since this isn't a machine I use..
2011-10-15T06:16:00.000Z	velociostrich	aioe	Yeah, I know what that's like
2011-10-15T06:16:00.000Z	velociostrich	aioe	Lol, but watch the language
2011-10-15T06:18:00.000Z	aioe	velociostrich	I realize I speak a little tasteless sometimes but I also think using "colorful" language is not something people should agonize over the way they do in here. especially when they're quicker to notice that, then they are to solve issues.
2011-10-15T06:18:00.000Z	velociostrich	aioe	True, but think of the children! (sarcasm)
2011-10-15T06:19:00.000Z	velociostrich	aioe	It's really just when it gets to the f-word being thrown around that it's a problem
2011-10-15T06:20:00.000Z	aioe	velociostrich	I'm with ol George Carlin on the 7 dirty words thing.. heh
2011-10-15T06:20:00.000Z	velociostrich	aioe	True @ the kids knowing foul stuff -- the things I've had said to me in the 4th grade would make most sailors queasy
2011-10-15T06:21:00.000Z	aioe	velociostrich	I have noticed a cleaning up of language in the open source community but it was flame wars and curse words since the beginning, grab yourself some kernel source and grep for that f word you mentioned
2011-10-15T06:22:00.000Z	aioe	velociostrich	those words better express the feeling of aggrivation that leads to the inability to properly express oneself better and it lends the kind of cues this kind of communication lack
2011-10-15T06:23:00.000Z	velociostrich	aioe	lol @ the grep, and you are right, but I think more of the stodgy old geezers running many businesses. It wouldn't do for your boss to walk past your desk in IT to see the f-word all over the place when you're just trying to get help in an IRC channel...
2011-10-15T06:26:00.000Z	aioe	velociostrich	yeah I suppose...  personally I wont work for people who rather me nicely not do something than ignorantly get it done.. this lady from an IT company had me running around for the last month sending me offer letters me going places and wasting time and money just to change her mind before I make any money.. and I told her off.. said she lives in an imaginary world where people who are qualified and reliable magically appear t
2011-10-15T06:27:00.000Z	velociostrich	aioe	Yeah, that won't let you get far (though I completely know what you're talking about)
2011-10-15T06:29:00.000Z	velociostrich	aioe	good stuff
