2006-09-20T12:48:00.000Z	boink		the /etc/resolv.conf is your dns
2006-09-20T12:49:00.000Z	boink		there is an #ubuntun-nl right?
2006-09-20T12:49:00.000Z	boink		most .nl computer nerds speak english well enuf
2006-09-20T12:50:00.000Z	boink		install it?
2006-09-20T12:52:00.000Z	boink		are there linux drivers for the dwl-g510?
2006-09-20T12:52:00.000Z	boink		otherwise, you'll need to use the ndiswrapper stuff
2006-09-20T12:53:00.000Z	boink		ideally, you want to buy a wireless card with an atheros chip
2006-09-20T12:53:00.000Z	boink		the atheros drivers are really good in linux
2006-09-20T12:53:00.000Z	boink		but there are other options too, like the ralink drivers as well (for the d-link G122)
2006-09-20T12:54:00.000Z	boink		apt-get install gcc ?
2006-09-20T12:54:00.000Z	uzyn	boink	it's not in synaptic
2006-09-20T12:54:00.000Z	uzyn	boink	I needed gcc 3.2, dapper comes with 4.0
2006-09-20T12:55:00.000Z	uzyn	boink	i found this, http://packages.ubuntu.com/warty/devel/gcc-3.2
2006-09-20T13:12:00.000Z	uzyn	boink	yeah i'm trying to compile
2006-09-20T13:12:00.000Z	uzyn	boink	http://www.qualnet.com/products/developer/sysreq.php it's this program. It requires gcc 3.2 to compile
2006-09-20T13:12:00.000Z	uzyn	boink	I've tried making, it's still using 4.0
2006-09-20T13:13:00.000Z	uzyn	boink	even thoguh I have gcc3.2 installed now
2006-09-20T13:18:00.000Z	uzyn	boink	thanks
2006-09-20T13:21:00.000Z	uzyn	boink	kalif: I've found it. It's indeed at /usr/bin/gcc-3.2. However, I tried CC=/usr/bin/gcc-3.2 gcc -v , and it's still showing version 4.0
