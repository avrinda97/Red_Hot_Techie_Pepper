2010-02-22T20:35:00.000Z	elliotjhug	otswim	svn co svn+ssh://your.remote-server.com/home/svn/test
2010-02-22T20:36:00.000Z	elliotjhug	otswim	the command I just sent should be the one you need
2010-02-22T20:36:00.000Z	otswim	elliotjhug	i'll try
2010-02-22T20:39:00.000Z	elliotjhug	otswim	any luck with the svn+ssh:// ?
2010-02-22T20:39:00.000Z	otswim	elliotjhug	but i don't have the /home/ path on the svn serv, i just have https://svnserv/trunk
2010-02-22T20:40:00.000Z	elliotjhug	otswim	just change the url - so svn+ssh://svnserv/trunk
2010-02-22T20:40:00.000Z	elliotjhug	otswim	svn co svn+ssh://svnserv/trunk
2010-02-22T20:40:00.000Z	otswim	elliotjhug	what about the sshserv path?
2010-02-22T20:41:00.000Z	elliotjhug	otswim	one moment - let me reread your earlier post and I'll make it trivial for you
2010-02-22T20:42:00.000Z	elliotjhug	otswim	is your svnserv on the same machine as your ssh serv?
2010-02-22T20:42:00.000Z	elliotjhug	otswim	e.g does your svn machine support ssh
2010-02-22T20:42:00.000Z	otswim	elliotjhug	no
2010-02-22T20:42:00.000Z	elliotjhug	otswim	so re-explain your question - cos I'm not sure what you're trying to do now
2010-02-22T20:43:00.000Z	otswim	elliotjhug	the university gave me some computer from which i can access the svn by 'svn co https://svnserv/trunk' and i can connect to this computer with my laptop using 'ssh username@sshserv', and i want to use svn+ssh from my laptop to access the svn
2010-02-22T20:48:00.000Z	elliotjhug	otswim	OK, svn+ssh is a bit different - svn+ssh is a protocol for accessing an svnserve over the ssh protocol, not what you want it for - you'll probably have to use the more complex suggestions
2010-02-22T20:49:00.000Z	otswim	elliotjhug	so the svn and the ssh need to be on the same server?
2010-02-22T20:49:00.000Z	elliotjhug	otswim	yeah - or at least as far as my understanding goes
2010-02-22T20:57:00.000Z	elliotjhug	otswim	you'd have to do that bit from the command line ssh
2010-02-22T20:57:00.000Z	otswim	elliotjhug	right i'm stupid :d
