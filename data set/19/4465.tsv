2009-03-23T04:35:00.000Z	buttons1		can someone tell me where the default desktop backgrounds are stored?
2009-03-23T04:36:00.000Z	oCean_	buttons1	/usr/share/backgrounds
2009-03-24T01:46:00.000Z	oCean_	buttons1	"dpkg -L packagename" will show you the files in that package.
2009-03-24T04:24:00.000Z	oCean_	buttons1	no, it's not in the alternatives method
2009-03-24T04:24:00.000Z	oCean_	buttons1	sometimes programs require JAVA_HOME to be set
2009-03-24T04:25:00.000Z	oCean_	buttons1	it should point to the root of your actual java installation.
2009-03-24T04:25:00.000Z	oCean_	buttons1	which java did you install? Like, I have java-6-sun installed, and the root of that installation is in /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun/jre
2009-03-24T04:27:00.000Z	oCean_	buttons1	Yes, I think that should work: "export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun/jre"
2009-03-24T04:28:00.000Z	oCean_	buttons1	but that depends on how well the script is written. Sometimes that JAVA_HOME has to be set to the JAVA_ROOT/bin subdirectory, so you might have to test it
2009-03-24T04:33:00.000Z	oCean_	buttons1	how are you coming along?
2009-03-24T04:33:00.000Z	oCean_	buttons1	error messages?
2009-03-24T04:34:00.000Z	oCean_	buttons1	what program are you running? As sudo maybe ?
2009-03-24T04:35:00.000Z	oCean_	buttons1	setting the variable as user, then running script sudo will not work
2009-03-24T04:35:00.000Z	oCean_	buttons1	are you running the script as sudo?
2009-03-24T04:36:00.000Z	oCean_	buttons1	it's just that you have to set the JAVA_HOME the right way
2009-03-24T04:37:00.000Z	oCean_	buttons1	are you running the script (whatever it is) as sudo??
2009-03-24T04:38:00.000Z	oCean_	buttons1	ok. And as user you do "export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/jre" and then ./scripttorun?
2009-03-24T04:39:00.000Z	oCean_	buttons1	no man
2009-03-24T04:40:00.000Z	oCean_	buttons1	but suit yourself, if you think it might help...
