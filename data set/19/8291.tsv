2007-05-10T15:45:00.000Z	usr_rob		what are the advantage of using ubuntu 7.04 server edition than debian etch ? (i am very familiar with debian on the server, i hav not tested ubuntu thou)
2007-05-10T15:45:00.000Z	usr_rob		*have
2007-05-10T15:46:00.000Z	idefixx	usr_rob	well i guess ubuntu is a lot faster in distribuitin cycles (6 month static)
2007-05-10T15:47:00.000Z	idefixx	usr_rob	even though i myself prefer debian on my server.. i can allways get some unstable stuff and think stability > features.
2007-05-10T15:49:00.000Z	usr_rob	idefixx	okey, thx. i will look up what version of mysqld, php ubuntu got, and se if i need the newer packages from it rather then the ones that are in debian
2007-05-10T15:50:00.000Z	idefixx	usr_rob	right now feisty and etch are pretty close together but the next ubuntu version is due in about 5 month... debian will probably be more than a year
2007-05-10T15:50:00.000Z	idefixx	usr_rob	again.. debian got unstable.. so no big deal there.
2007-05-10T15:51:00.000Z	usr_rob	idefixx	heh, i don't want to run debian unstable on the server
2007-05-10T15:52:00.000Z	idefixx	usr_rob	well they got testing as well ;)
2007-05-10T15:52:00.000Z	usr_rob	idefixx	yeah, yeah ;)
2007-05-10T15:53:00.000Z	idefixx	usr_rob	im not talking about updateing the whole system though just pick a few packages from testing and/or unstable to fit your version needs
2007-05-10T15:53:00.000Z	usr_rob	idefixx	that is okey, but a security risk thou, but indeed it will work ..
2007-05-10T15:53:00.000Z	idefixx	usr_rob	im no authority on ubuntu server (since i dont use them) but i guess they are in any case not as stable as debian - i mean how can they? they take stuff from testing/unstable themselfes
2007-05-10T15:55:00.000Z	usr_rob	idefixx	yeah, that's right but i asumed they have tested the unstable/testing packages more than the unstable/testing packages in debian
2007-05-10T15:55:00.000Z	idefixx	usr_rob	well i guess so :) who knows
2007-05-10T15:56:00.000Z	usr_rob	idefixx	that's why i wrote the first question ;)
2007-05-10T15:57:00.000Z	usr_rob	idefixx	thx for your thoughts about it
2007-05-10T15:57:00.000Z	idefixx	usr_rob	not much more left for me to say then... thats pretty much all i know ;)
2007-05-10T15:57:00.000Z	idefixx	usr_rob	np
