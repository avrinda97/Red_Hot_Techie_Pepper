2008-01-06T07:15:00.000Z	shadix		so is Compiz another desktop enviro like gnome and KDE?
2008-01-06T07:15:00.000Z	RyanPrior	shadix	No. It is another window manager like Metacity.
2008-01-06T07:16:00.000Z	shadix	RyanPrior	so my theme and other customizations would remain the same?
2008-01-06T07:17:00.000Z	RyanPrior	shadix	Your themes should stay in tact when you switch to Compiz, I think.
2008-01-06T07:17:00.000Z	shadix	RyanPrior	np
2008-01-06T07:17:00.000Z	shadix	RyanPrior	one way to find out lol
2008-01-06T07:34:00.000Z	shadix	RyanPrior	I have that installed but i still don't see the effects. do I need to enable Extra visual effects or custom in apperance managaer?
2008-01-06T07:35:00.000Z	RyanPrior	shadix	You need to enable Custom, and then use the Custom options to enable things like fire.
2008-01-06T07:35:00.000Z	RyanPrior	shadix	It's one of those things that's a lot easier to show in person, I wish I could look over your shoulder and walk you through it. =D
2008-01-06T07:35:00.000Z	shadix	RyanPrior	it says the composite extrention is not available
2008-01-06T07:36:00.000Z	RyanPrior	shadix	That means your graphics card isn't set up to handle compiz.
2008-01-06T07:36:00.000Z	RyanPrior	shadix	What graphics card to you have?
2008-01-06T07:36:00.000Z	shadix	RyanPrior	ATI X700 pro
2008-01-06T07:37:00.000Z	RyanPrior	shadix	You can try using xgl. The package name is xserver-xorg I think
2008-01-06T07:39:00.000Z	shadix	RyanPrior	what exactly is xgl?
2008-01-06T07:39:00.000Z	RyanPrior	shadix	It's a replacement x server that enables graphical effects on many ATI graphics cards.
2008-01-06T07:41:00.000Z	shadix	RyanPrior	ok it's dled and installed do I have to active it or just try now
