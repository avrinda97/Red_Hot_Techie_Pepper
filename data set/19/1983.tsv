2010-08-08T03:28:00.000Z	fidelix_		Not possible only with apache
2010-08-08T03:28:00.000Z	fidelix_		I know how to configure apache
2010-08-08T03:28:00.000Z	fidelix_		Well, i dont use it anyway
2010-08-08T03:29:00.000Z	fidelix_		I use nginx, and i have several sites working already on my server
2010-08-08T03:29:00.000Z	fidelix_		The problem is, mx records dont work, and some people on some zones cant access my site. Cuz i'm using a free dns hosting at freedns.ws
2010-08-08T03:30:00.000Z	fidelix_		Not that simple ilovefairuz.
2010-08-08T03:31:00.000Z	fidelix_		as i said... i need wildcard subdomains, i need mx records for all domains.
2010-08-08T03:31:00.000Z	fidelix_		OK. Could you please help me setting bind?
2010-08-08T03:32:00.000Z	fidelix_		Or point me to a cheap&good dns hosting
2010-08-08T03:34:00.000Z	fidelix_		I have webmin installed, but i still dont know how to configure bind.
2010-08-08T03:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fidelix_	 theres entire boosk written on using/configuring bind.
2010-08-08T03:35:00.000Z	fidelix_	Dr_Willis	saying that does not help.
2010-08-08T03:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fidelix_	 you expect us here in IRC to give you a 'configure bind in 10 sec' summary? or what excactly?
2010-08-08T03:35:00.000Z	fidelix_		I want my sites to work and thats all, i dont need to manage a hosting corp so i dont need to read a fu**** book.
2010-08-08T03:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fidelix_	 i dont even know why youa re using bind at all.
2010-08-08T03:36:00.000Z	fidelix_		So, why should i use Dr_Willis?
2010-08-08T03:36:00.000Z	fidelix_		*what should i use.
2010-08-08T03:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fidelix_	 why are you needing it? what are you doing thasts so special you need your own dns server?
2010-08-08T03:36:00.000Z	fidelix_	Dr_Willis	i have a VPS hosting package. And i host several sites of mine in it.
