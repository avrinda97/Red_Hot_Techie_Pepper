2006-09-10T15:10:00.000Z	mooky		still sets the mode ro 102x768
2006-09-10T15:12:00.000Z	mooky		didn't really do much
2006-09-10T15:12:00.000Z	mooky		it just explains how to run dpkg-reconfigure for x
2006-09-10T15:13:00.000Z	mooky		when you say the nvidia driver thats shipped with ubuntu - do you mean the binary nvidia or the nv driver ?
2006-09-10T15:13:00.000Z	Jowi	mooky	no idea, i don't have nvidia here. :) does it work with the vesa driver?
2006-09-10T15:04:00.000Z	Jowi	mooky	LCD or CRT?
2006-09-10T15:04:00.000Z	mooky	Jowi	LCD
2006-09-10T15:04:00.000Z	Jowi	mooky	comment out the HorizSync line in xorg.conf. set the VertRefresh to 60 and see if that help.
2006-09-10T15:05:00.000Z	Jowi	mooky	sometimes the configurator for Xorg "helpfully" add a horizsync even though an LCD don't use it.
2006-09-10T15:09:00.000Z	mooky	Jowi	no difference
2006-09-10T15:10:00.000Z	Jowi	mooky	either a) your monitor does not support it or b) your driver is not working as it should or c) if the Modes line in xorg.conf only contain "1280x1024" does it work then?
2006-09-10T15:12:00.000Z	mooky	Jowi	monitor supports it - works in windows, and other distros with xorg 7/nvidia binary driver. Driver is x86_64 - so it could be not working as expected, but it shouldn't be. c.) modeline only 1280x1024 - xserver fails to start
2006-09-10T15:12:00.000Z	mooky	Jowi	used the fix resolution wiki page
2006-09-10T15:13:00.000Z	Jowi	mooky	does the nvidia driver that ubuntu is shipped with work with that resolution?
2006-09-10T15:14:00.000Z	Jowi	mooky	if vesa works at least we know where the prob lies
2006-09-10T15:15:00.000Z	mooky	Jowi	bang on the money, vesa works, nvidia driver doesn't
2006-09-10T15:15:00.000Z	Jowi	mooky	file a bug :)
2006-09-10T15:16:00.000Z	mooky	Jowi	thanks,good call suggesting vesa
2006-09-10T15:30:00.000Z	mooky	Jowi	bug logged
