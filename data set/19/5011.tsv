2008-09-20T07:11:00.000Z	sfer3		Is anyone able to help me with getting a microphone (or at least my microphone inputs) working on ubuntu?
2008-09-20T07:12:00.000Z	sfer3		Doesn't look like the command exists...
2008-09-20T07:14:00.000Z	sfer3		Yes, that's what it says, ceil420
2008-09-20T07:14:00.000Z	ceil420	sfer3	try su -c 'alsaconf' with root's password
2008-09-20T07:11:00.000Z	ceil420	sfer3	try alsaconf?
2008-09-20T07:12:00.000Z	sfer3	ceil420	just type alsaconf into command line, do I?
2008-09-20T07:12:00.000Z	ceil420	sfer3	if you have the alsa-utils package installed, yes. you may need to be root or use sudo to use the command
2008-09-20T07:13:00.000Z	sfer3	ceil420	Tried with sudo - command not found. Tried to install it - says it is the newset version. Any help?
2008-09-20T07:14:00.000Z	ceil420	sfer3	alsa-utils is already installed?
2008-09-20T07:15:00.000Z	sfer3	ceil420	su: Authentication failure
2008-09-20T07:15:00.000Z	ceil420	sfer3	it needs root's password, not yours
2008-09-20T07:15:00.000Z	sfer3	ceil420	Yeah, I know... I entered the root's password, but with no success
2008-09-20T07:16:00.000Z	sfer3	ceil420	Tried every possible password I have the root password set as - even the one I type to get sudo su
2008-09-20T07:16:00.000Z	ceil420	sfer3	can you use "su -" to login as root?
2008-09-20T07:17:00.000Z	sfer3	ceil420	Nope. :S
2008-09-20T07:17:00.000Z	ceil420	sfer3	i actually use Debian, not Ubuntu; apparently they're not as similar as i'd hoped :x sorry, but someone else will have to help you
2008-09-20T07:19:00.000Z	ceil420	sfer3	alsa-utils is just a package that provides the alsaconf command
2008-09-20T07:19:00.000Z	sfer3	ceil420	I think I know why it doesn't have it - https://bugs.launchpad.net/alsa-utils/+bug/29597
2008-09-20T07:20:00.000Z	ceil420	sfer3	that's weird; i'm on Debian Lenny and got alsaconf from alsa-utils
