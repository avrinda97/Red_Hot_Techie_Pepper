2009-05-08T15:00:00.000Z	roxahris		I keep having an error on trying to ompile programs
2009-05-08T15:00:00.000Z	roxahris		checking for GTK... configure: error: Package requirements (gtk+-2.0 >= 2.0.0) were not met:
2009-05-08T15:00:00.000Z	roxahris		Every damn time
2009-05-08T15:01:00.000Z	roxahris		I'm quite sure I have gtk
2009-05-08T15:03:00.000Z	roxahris		But... yeah
2009-05-08T15:03:00.000Z	roxahris		It can't find GTK! What do I do?
2009-05-08T15:03:00.000Z	ikonia	roxahris	what can't ?
2009-05-08T15:03:00.000Z	roxahris		Anything I try to compile
2009-05-08T15:03:00.000Z	roxahris		It just tells me it can't fine gtk+-2.0
2009-05-08T15:03:00.000Z	ikonia	roxahris	read the basics on how to compile and dependencies/headers/development packages
2009-05-08T15:04:00.000Z	ikonia	roxahris	tldp.org has a good introduction
2009-05-08T15:04:00.000Z	roxahris		I know how to compile
2009-05-08T15:04:00.000Z	ikonia	roxahris	then why are you asking questions ?
2009-05-08T15:04:00.000Z	roxahris		This has just never happened before
2009-05-08T15:04:00.000Z	roxahris		:x
2009-05-08T15:04:00.000Z	roxahris		I've tried three things; guake, tilda, and mdxplay
2009-05-08T15:04:00.000Z	roxahris	lesshaste	What's it's name?
2009-05-08T15:05:00.000Z	ikonia	roxahris	what are you trying to build ?
