2007-03-07T17:00:00.000Z	xethx96		apt-get install build-essential fakeroot linux-headers-$(uname -r)
2007-03-07T17:00:00.000Z	xethx96		i dont understand this code...
2007-03-07T17:00:00.000Z	xethx96		mostly the $(uname -r)
2007-03-07T17:00:00.000Z	bruenig	xethx96	it is installing three packages
2007-03-07T17:00:00.000Z	bruenig	xethx96	do uname -r in the terminal, then you will get it
2007-03-08T17:07:00.000Z	bruenig	xethx96	there is something seriously wrong with your sources.list, pastebin the output of this command "cat /etc/apt/sources.list"
2007-03-08T17:15:00.000Z	bruenig	xethx96	yeah that is your problem
2007-03-08T17:13:00.000Z	bruenig	xethx96	what are you doing?
2007-03-08T17:13:00.000Z	bruenig	xethx96	you are installing build-essential?
2007-03-08T17:14:00.000Z	bruenig	xethx96	right but that is what you are trying to do?
2007-03-08T17:15:00.000Z	bruenig	xethx96	ok and you have an internet connection right?
2007-03-08T17:15:00.000Z	bruenig	xethx96	it needs to download build-essential and install it
2007-03-08T17:16:00.000Z	bruenig	xethx96	it is going to take more than that. You will need ndiswrapper and others, I don't know all the exact packages
2007-03-08T17:17:00.000Z	xethx96	bruenig	i dont have a connection on linux
