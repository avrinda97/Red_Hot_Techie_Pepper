2006-03-25T16:39:00.000Z	Blissex	nlogax	that would be amazing...
2006-03-25T16:40:00.000Z	nlogax	Blissex	    Ahem... Enlightenment 16 :-)
2006-03-25T16:41:00.000Z	nlogax	Blissex	I've heard quite a few ppl saying Gnome's now faster (again)
2006-03-25T16:49:00.000Z	nlogax	Blissex	what advantages in JFS?
2006-03-25T16:49:00.000Z	Blissex	nlogax	well, depends -- but it usually resists fragmentation rather better, and it has btree directories, and can scale up a lot better (latter not important for root though).
2006-03-25T16:50:00.000Z	Blissex	nlogax	I have done some extensive testing, links to follow...

2006-03-25T16:53:00.000Z	Blissex	nlogax	kingspawn: more to follow, wait
2006-03-25T16:53:00.000Z	nlogax	Blissex	does JFS have a higher memory overhead?  either for cache or for the kernel module itself?

2006-03-25T16:54:00.000Z	Blissex	nlogax	no.

2006-03-25T16:56:00.000Z	nlogax	Blissex	I can now say I've met my 1st filesystem evangelist :-P
2006-03-25T16:57:00.000Z	nlogax	Blissex	so you have to fsck?
2006-03-25T16:58:00.000Z	Blissex	nlogax	no, of course it is journaled.
2006-03-25T16:58:00.000Z	Blissex	nlogax	the issue is that some people that recovery recovers not just metadata but data too. Only 'ext3' with 'data=journal' recover data too.
2006-03-25T16:59:00.000Z	nlogax	Blissex	O I C - I thought fsck already did that (lost+found) or is this withouth needing fsck?
