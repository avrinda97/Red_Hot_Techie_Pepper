2005-06-14T13:40:00.000Z	HappyFool	syntaxerror64	ah, fair enough

2005-06-14T13:41:00.000Z	syntaxerror64	HappyFool	on my xp machine, when i browse the network it sees the ubuntu machine, but no shared folder under it.

2005-06-14T13:41:00.000Z	HappyFool	syntaxerror64	i can help you tweak /etc/samba/smb.conf, but i think you should first read the page ubotu posted up there
2005-06-14T13:41:00.000Z	syntaxerror64	HappyFool	i'll check it out and get back to you, thanks.
