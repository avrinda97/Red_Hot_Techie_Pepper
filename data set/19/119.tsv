2012-08-31T10:30:00.000Z	pyrrhic		Anyone experienced with VirtualBox on 12.04?
2012-08-31T10:32:00.000Z	smw	pyrrhic	that is done in your computer's BIOS
2012-08-31T10:32:00.000Z	smw	pyrrhic	it normally is an option that mentions "virtualization"
2012-08-31T10:36:00.000Z	smw	pyrrhic	success?
2012-08-31T10:36:00.000Z	pyrrhic	smw	yep
2012-08-31T10:36:00.000Z	pyrrhic	smw	changed virtualization to enabled from disabled. lol
2012-08-31T10:36:00.000Z	smw	pyrrhic	yep
2012-08-31T10:42:00.000Z	pyrrhic	smw	think i can repair a corrupt ntfs partition with win7 in vbox?
2012-08-31T10:42:00.000Z	smw	pyrrhic	the corrupt ntfs partition is actually in vbox?
2012-08-31T10:45:00.000Z	pyrrhic	smw	no
2012-08-31T10:45:00.000Z	pyrrhic	smw	i had windows 7 before ubuntu 12.04 ; got rid of it and had a media partition thats NTFS
2012-08-31T10:46:00.000Z	smw	pyrrhic	wait, so you overwrote your entire disk with linux and want to recover the partition?
2012-08-31T10:48:00.000Z	pyrrhic	smw	no smw. I had a separate partition for media all on the same drive.
2012-08-31T10:48:00.000Z	smw	pyrrhic	is the partition still there?
2012-08-31T10:49:00.000Z	pyrrhic	smw	yes it's just corrupt
2012-08-31T10:49:00.000Z	pyrrhic	smw	i was resizing it in gparted and the power went out
2012-08-31T10:49:00.000Z	smw	pyrrhic	ok, this is beyond my knowledge
2012-08-31T10:49:00.000Z	smw	pyrrhic	ouch, that is bad luck
2012-08-31T10:49:00.000Z	pyrrhic	smw	yep. just a surge.\
