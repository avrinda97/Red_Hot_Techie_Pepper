2008-08-23T04:03:00.000Z	koushik		I have ubunutu installed on my HDD. Still it will not boot. If I use install CD I get the boot-menu, then I choose boot from first hard disk - this works!
2008-08-23T04:04:00.000Z	koushik		can someone help me fix this and get booting from hard drive w/o CD ?
2008-08-23T04:04:00.000Z	ShdwShinobi	koushik	do you have more than one harddrives in your computer?
2008-08-23T04:07:00.000Z	ShdwShinobi	koushik	you'll want to make sure grub is installed right... give me one second
2008-08-23T04:08:00.000Z	ShdwShinobi	koushik	I would say try this if it isn't getting to grub. It should make sure that grub is the bootloader. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows
2008-08-23T04:10:00.000Z	koushik	ShdwShinobi	thanks. I will try that. I will get back after a reboot.

2008-08-23T04:26:00.000Z	koushik	ShdwShinobi	I checked the link.. I tried the option for running grub within ubuntu: section "From Inside Ubuntu"
2008-08-23T04:27:00.000Z	koushik	ShdwShinobi	however, I don't see the item grub inside my /sbin directory
2008-08-23T04:27:00.000Z	koushik	ShdwShinobi	I do see it in /usr/sbin/grub
2008-08-23T04:28:00.000Z	koushik	ShdwShinobi	Can I run that instead ?
2008-08-23T04:28:00.000Z	ShdwShinobi	koushik	sorry... I didn't specify. just follow the quick start
