2006-10-04T10:01:00.000Z	iter	mztriz	should be like eth0 or ath0
2006-10-04T10:01:00.000Z	iter	mztriz	ok, and you're supposed to get a IP by DHCP or is it static
2006-10-04T10:02:00.000Z	iter	mztriz	lo and sit0 you can ignore for now
2006-10-04T10:02:00.000Z	iter	mztriz	eth0 and eth1 are your network cards
2006-10-04T10:02:00.000Z	mztriz	iter	it's suppose to be DHCP
2006-10-04T10:02:00.000Z	iter	mztriz	so the network that's plugged in right now has a working dhcp server ?
2006-10-04T10:03:00.000Z	iter	mztriz	plug it in
2006-10-04T10:03:00.000Z	iter	mztriz	then run dhclient and see what happens
2006-10-04T10:10:00.000Z	mztriz	iter	what do you want me to do ?
