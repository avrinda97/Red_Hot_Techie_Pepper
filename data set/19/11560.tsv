2006-11-21T06:08:00.000Z	Belboz99		well, I haven't heard of any software issues that would cause that between that version and that CPU PhibreOptix
2006-11-21T06:10:00.000Z	Belboz99		so, anyone know why Cedega locks up Ubuntu-64 entirely, leaving a hard reset as the only solution?
2006-11-21T06:11:00.000Z	Belboz99		I can't even get past the Licence Agreement page :(
2006-11-21T06:12:00.000Z	soundray	Belboz99	is Cedega even meant to be 64bit compatible?
2006-11-21T06:12:00.000Z	Belboz99	soundray	not sure
2008-11-05T00:45:00.000Z	soundray	Belboz99	is it a fresh installation, or has it worked previously?
2008-11-05T00:45:00.000Z	Belboz99	soundray	it's an upgraded 8.04 -> 8.10, and yes, it did work
2008-11-05T00:46:00.000Z	soundray	Belboz99	have you tried with another user?
2008-11-05T00:46:00.000Z	Belboz99	soundray	yes, that doesn't work, xfce does work however
2008-11-05T00:47:00.000Z	soundray	Belboz99	has your upgrade completed? If in doubt, try 'sudo apt-get -f install ; sudo dpkg --configure -a'
2008-11-05T00:48:00.000Z	Belboz99	soundray	I did have some interruptions during the upgrade, one hard-lock, but I've since recovered from it otherwise sucessfully, everything you mentioned checks out ok
2008-11-05T00:49:00.000Z	soundray	Belboz99	anything in your $HOME/.xsession-errors ?
2008-11-05T00:51:00.000Z	Belboz99	soundray	the last line includes a "Gdk-CRITICAL" dealing with gnome-screensaver-gl-helper
2008-11-05T00:53:00.000Z	soundray	Belboz99	perhaps it's hanging on that very program. You could enter your login details, switch to the text console and check with ps whether it's running, and possibly kill it.
2008-11-05T00:54:00.000Z	Belboz99	soundray	dpkg returned an error trying to reinstall gnome-screensaver, exit status 245
2008-11-05T00:55:00.000Z	soundray	Belboz99	interesting -- look at /var/lib/dpkg/info/gnome-screensaver.postinst to see what it's doing when it throws the 245
2008-11-05T00:56:00.000Z	soundray	Belboz99	or maybe it's another gnome-screensaver.* script -- you should be able to tell from the dpkg output
2008-11-05T01:05:00.000Z	Belboz99	soundray	thanks for getting me on the right track, I ran sudo gconf-schemas --register /usr/share/gconf/schemas/* and then sudo apt-get install --reinstall gnome-screensaver, works flawlessly now! :-D
2008-11-05T01:06:00.000Z	soundray	Belboz99	interesting. How did you find the gconf-schemas thing?
