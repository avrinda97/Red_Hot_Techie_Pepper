2007-04-16T10:48:00.000Z	wj32	user____	make sure its still in the resps. Check the wine Package's properties to see if your version is in there.
2007-04-16T10:49:00.000Z	wj32	user____	open up synaptic. right-click on the wine package. select Properties
2007-04-16T10:49:00.000Z	wj32	user____	Click on Versions. See if the version you want is there.
2007-04-16T10:51:00.000Z	wj32	user____	is wine already installed? if so, goto Package -> Force Version... and select the version that you want. then Apply.
2007-04-16T10:52:00.000Z	wj32	user____	yes, but does it work?
2007-04-16T10:52:00.000Z	wj32	user____	so... you've installed 9.22 already?

2007-04-16T10:54:00.000Z	wj32	user____	is your cache set to delete itself every day or something?
2007-04-16T10:54:00.000Z	wj32	user____	i recommend setting it to not delete anything in your cache.
2007-04-16T10:54:00.000Z	wj32	user____	so if you want to downgrade or create your own package CD, you can use your cache
2007-04-16T10:55:00.000Z	wj32	user____	ok.
