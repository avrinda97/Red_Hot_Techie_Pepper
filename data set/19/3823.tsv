2009-07-23T08:18:00.000Z	type_t		wit command sudo iwconfig channel 11
2009-07-23T08:19:00.000Z	type_t		but 11 has to be the channel the AP is using too.

2009-07-23T08:25:00.000Z	type_t		the Acces Point you mean? well when you do sudo iwconfig wifiblah0 channel 2 and keep doing it 1- 11 you should cycle up until it lets you know.
