2006-10-12T06:03:00.000Z	bayzider	kitche	how do you startx
2006-10-12T06:06:00.000Z	kitche	bayzider	you just type in startx after you log into the console
2006-10-12T06:07:00.000Z	bayzider	kitche	X: it igves me this
2006-10-12T06:07:00.000Z	kitche	bayzider	use paste

2006-10-12T06:11:00.000Z	kitche	bayzider	try this in a console dpkg-reconfigure xorg-xserver
2006-10-12T06:12:00.000Z	kitche	bayzider	don't forget sudo
2006-10-12T06:13:00.000Z	kitche	bayzider	hmm maybe I got the package name wrong xserver-xorg
2006-10-12T06:15:00.000Z	kitche	bayzider	umm you have to know that but you can probably just press enter to that
