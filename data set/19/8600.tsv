2007-04-14T13:11:00.000Z	variant	xyz-abc	click places > network
2007-04-14T13:12:00.000Z	variant	xyz-abc	it will show a list of network shares that are available
2007-04-14T13:12:00.000Z	xyz-abc	variant	it doesnt see my winxp pc
2007-04-14T13:12:00.000Z	variant	xyz-abc	and do you have the drive shared on winxp?
2007-04-14T13:13:00.000Z	variant	xyz-abc	whichever one you're shareing
2007-04-14T13:13:00.000Z	variant	xyz-abc	really depends how you have it set up..
2007-04-14T13:16:00.000Z	xyz-abc	variant	just for the hell of it i shared another folder, called 'movies-xp", but this is irrelevant, simply my XP pc doesn't show up smb://mshome on my Ubuntu pc
2007-04-14T13:17:00.000Z	xyz-abc	variant	the MSHOME workgroup shows up
2007-04-14T13:17:00.000Z	xyz-abc	variant	I think I told SMB to 'belong' to the MSHOME workgroup in the apst
