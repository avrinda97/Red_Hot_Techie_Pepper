2010-06-05T14:00:00.000Z	TommyH		How about hiding partitions/volumes in the File Browser? (i hae a windows partition i want to make sure i never touch)
2010-06-05T14:02:00.000Z	OldPete	TommyH	If you never want to touch it, just don't mount it at boot.
2010-06-05T14:03:00.000Z	TommyH	OldPete	 How do i not mount it at boot?  i just installed ubuntu, and it automounts all my partitions
2010-06-05T14:04:00.000Z	OldPete	TommyH	Do you know how to edit fstab from the command line?
2010-06-05T14:04:00.000Z	TommyH	OldPete	no :'(
2010-06-05T14:04:00.000Z	OldPete	TommyH	You know how to use the command line at all?
2010-06-05T14:05:00.000Z	TommyH	OldPete	ya, i know how to enter commands haha
2010-06-05T14:06:00.000Z	OldPete	TommyH	Okay.  I'm not sure what text editor you have installed, so the command I'm going to give will have to be changed for whatever it is.  I use one called pico.
2010-06-05T14:07:00.000Z	OldPete	TommyH	sudo pico /etc/fstab
2010-06-05T14:08:00.000Z	OldPete	TommyH	Look for a line that will be labeled showing where the windows partition is currently being mounted.  Comment out the line after that with a #.  Then save.
2010-06-05T14:08:00.000Z	OldPete		Dangit ... Is imagebin.ca down for everyone, or is it just me?
2010-06-05T14:12:00.000Z	TommyH	OldPete	 There's no windows drives listed there, i guess the issue is not that my drives are being mounted
2010-06-05T14:12:00.000Z	TommyH		It's that they are even listed in my File Browser
2010-06-05T14:12:00.000Z	TommyH		I want to remove them from all visibility as if they never existed
2010-06-05T14:13:00.000Z	OldPete	TommyH	If it's being mounted, it's listed there somewhere unless you're doing it manuall, which it doesn't sound like you are.
2010-06-05T14:14:00.000Z	TommyH	OldPete	 I think i found a post on the ubuntu forums! http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=99086&page=2 so i think that will work out exactly what i need
2010-06-05T14:14:00.000Z	TommyH		thanks!
2010-06-05T14:15:00.000Z	OldPete	TommyH	Yeah, that should help you.
