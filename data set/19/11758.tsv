2005-12-18T14:59:00.000Z	purplefeltangel		about:config doesn't do nothing
2005-12-18T14:59:00.000Z	purplefeltangel		the middle click thing does nothing
2005-12-18T14:59:00.000Z	purplefeltangel		its no big deal; i was ust curious
2005-12-18T14:59:00.000Z	purplefeltangel		uh, yeah i am using firefox. about:config is working; it's the middle click that wasn't
2005-12-18T14:59:00.000Z	purplefeltangel		i'm not an idiot
2005-12-18T15:01:00.000Z	dooglus	purplefeltangel	you said it didn't no nothing
2005-12-18T15:01:00.000Z	dooglus	purplefeltangel	you didn't say what it did no
2005-12-18T15:01:00.000Z	purplefeltangel	dooglus	what?
2005-12-18T15:02:00.000Z	dooglus	purplefeltangel	replace 'no' with 'do' in my previous 2 sentences and they might make sense.
2005-12-18T15:02:00.000Z	dooglus		"21:59 < purplefeltangel> about:config doesn't do nothing"
2005-12-18T15:02:00.000Z	purplefeltangel	dooglus	oh o_O maybe i typed about:config in the wrong window
2005-12-18T15:03:00.000Z	dooglus	purplefeltangel	type control-l then type about:config and hit return
2005-12-18T15:03:00.000Z	purplefeltangel	dooglus	i did that! jesus. about:config is working.
2005-12-18T15:03:00.000Z	purplefeltangel		apparently the first time i typed it it was in this window by mistake.
2005-12-18T15:04:00.000Z	dooglus	purplefeltangel	so what's the problem?
2005-12-18T15:04:00.000Z	purplefeltangel	dooglus	there was none.
2005-12-18T15:04:00.000Z	dooglus	purplefeltangel	glad to hear it.  next?
