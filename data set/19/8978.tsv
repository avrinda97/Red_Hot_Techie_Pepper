2007-01-13T17:33:00.000Z	pollywog		any ideas on configuring a rt2500 card in Edgy?
2007-01-13T17:33:00.000Z	un_operateur	pollywog	is that the wireless card?
2007-01-13T17:34:00.000Z	un_operateur	pollywog	IIRC there is a rt2500 package containing the drivers
2007-01-13T17:34:00.000Z	pollywog	un_operateur	I have it installed
2007-01-14T06:40:00.000Z	un_operateur	pollywog	IIRC, inetd needs to be installed (correct me if i am wrong)
2007-01-14T06:40:00.000Z	pollywog	un_operateur	that is possible but I already have a /etc/inetd.conf
2007-01-14T06:42:00.000Z	un_operateur	pollywog	you only need [x] inetd if you are going to run services that depend on them -- so for the average desktop user installing inetd has no real benefit
2007-01-14T06:43:00.000Z	pollywog	un_operateur	correct, so they should not have installed ktalk
2007-01-14T06:43:00.000Z	un_operateur	pollywog	do you indeed have inetd running -- ps aux | grep -i inetd ?
2007-01-14T06:44:00.000Z	pollywog	un_operateur	no it is not installed but the conf file for it was there
2007-01-14T06:45:00.000Z	un_operateur	pollywog	errr, to come to think about it, just because a configuration file for a peice of software exists doesn't necessarily mean the software does exist.. :)
2007-01-14T06:45:00.000Z	pollywog	un_operateur	but in this case the presence of the file would make the user think they had protection they in fact do not have
2007-01-14T06:46:00.000Z	un_operateur	pollywog	well, it's like saying -- Mr Smith over the road has a garage in his house, therefore he must have a car!! :)
2007-01-14T06:46:00.000Z	pollywog	un_operateur	no that logic is faulty
2007-01-14T06:47:00.000Z	un_operateur	pollywog	just install inetd and be done with it :)
2007-01-14T06:48:00.000Z	un_operateur	pollywog	lots of network-capable packages make changes to inetd.conf .. its possible one of them touched the file
2007-01-14T06:49:00.000Z	pollywog	un_operateur	you just don't get it.  If the file is there it is for inetd daemon
2007-01-14T06:49:00.000Z	un_operateur	pollywog	no, you just dont get it -- the file exists, the software doesnt -- why waste your time going on about it? lol
2007-01-14T06:49:00.000Z	pollywog	un_operateur	okay truce
