2006-11-11T15:23:00.000Z	graeme		upgrading breezy to dapper ... what's the best way ?
2006-11-11T15:24:00.000Z	xarq	graeme	you could dist-upgrade or do a clean install, depends on how much backing up you feel like doing
2006-11-11T15:24:00.000Z	xarq	graeme	if your data really matters to you you'll back up in either case though
2006-11-11T15:25:00.000Z	graeme	xarq	don't care about backing anything up ...
2006-11-11T15:54:00.000Z	xarq	graeme	you probably want to run DSL on it
2006-11-11T15:54:00.000Z	graeme	xarq	?
2006-11-11T15:54:00.000Z	xarq	graeme	damn-small linux
2006-11-11T15:55:00.000Z	graeme	xarq	I don't think it's that bad. Dapper should run fine methinks ?
2006-11-11T15:55:00.000Z	xarq	graeme	depends on how much frustration and performance you feel like putting up with
2006-11-11T15:57:00.000Z	xarq	graeme	well you have enough hard drive space, but 256 MB of ram and P3 it will run a bit slow
2006-11-11T15:58:00.000Z	graeme	xarq	yeah, sorry I checked. It's running with 386MB
2006-11-11T15:59:00.000Z	xarq	graeme	also, you might try a lighter-weight window manager like fluxbox or xubuntu if it feels sluggish
2006-11-11T16:06:00.000Z	xarq	graeme	you can set it later if you wish
2006-11-11T16:06:00.000Z	graeme	xarq	it's empty ?
2006-11-11T16:07:00.000Z	xarq	graeme	no, it's off
2006-11-11T16:07:00.000Z	graeme	xarq	even in breezy ?
2006-11-11T16:07:00.000Z	xarq	graeme	in all versions
2006-11-11T16:08:00.000Z	xarq	graeme	sudo -s usually does
2006-11-11T16:11:00.000Z	xarq	graeme	the point is it's safer to only elevate privileges when you nede to
