2007-12-14T00:48:00.000Z	Arelis		How do i speed Ubuntu up?
2007-12-14T00:48:00.000Z	disasm	Arelis	use fluxbox ;-)
2007-12-14T00:49:00.000Z	Arelis	disasm	Once in there: How do i run my programs, how do i browse my files, how do i access my hardware?
2007-12-14T00:49:00.000Z	disasm	Arelis	command line? I know, not the answer you're looking for, it's all I use though ;-)
2007-12-14T00:50:00.000Z	Arelis	disasm	Naw, i want to be able to access my hardware quick 'n easy
2007-12-14T00:50:00.000Z	disasm	Arelis	what's quicker than the command line :-P
2007-12-14T00:51:00.000Z	Arelis	disasm	the GUI is somehow faster.
2007-12-14T00:51:00.000Z	disasm	Arelis	there is always the option of adding more ram, maybe a faster processor as well
2007-12-14T00:53:00.000Z	disasm	Arelis	most of the apps I use (firefox, thunderbird, aterm, rox, xlock) I map in fluxbox to WIN-X where X is a given letter, such ash WIN-F for firefox, that way that stupid windows key has a use, and I can open up applications a heck of a lot faster than using a mouse and scrolling through menus
2007-12-14T00:53:00.000Z	Arelis	disasm	and what about games?
2007-12-14T00:53:00.000Z	disasm	Arelis	WIN-D for Diablo II, that's about the only game I play :-P
2007-12-14T00:54:00.000Z	Arelis	disasm	hmm, sounds like fluxbox may be handy after all - and how do i get a run dialog? and does it really make so much difference againt GNOME? i mean, it's only the desktop environment - the other applications use CPU too
2007-12-14T00:54:00.000Z	disasm	Arelis	you could create ~/games directory, symlink all your games into it, then do WIN-G to run rox in the directory ~/games, and then double click the one you want
2007-12-14T00:55:00.000Z	disasm	Arelis	by run dialog you mean a terminal?
2007-12-14T00:55:00.000Z	Arelis	disasm	no, the thing you get when you press ALT+F2
2007-12-14T00:56:00.000Z	disasm	Arelis	there's something called grun, might be what you're looking for
2007-12-14T00:57:00.000Z	disasm	Arelis	yeah, that looks like what you want, install grun in synaptic, then map in your keys file alt-F2 to run grun
2007-12-14T00:58:00.000Z	disasm	Arelis	of course, I map alt-F2 to my workspaces, so I'd do something like alt-R instead, which would be Mod1 R :ExecCommand grun
2007-12-14T01:00:00.000Z	Arelis	disasm	no problem, i guess:0
