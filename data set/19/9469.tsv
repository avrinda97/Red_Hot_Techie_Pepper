2006-11-22T11:58:00.000Z	Eclypse	rickyfingers	what's firestarter?
2006-11-22T11:58:00.000Z	rickyfingers	Eclypse	maby I don't have your situation understood properly, you have a wireless router that you want to get the laptop working with
2006-11-22T12:03:00.000Z	rickyfingers	Eclypse	try firestarter
2006-11-22T12:04:00.000Z	Eclypse	rickyfingers	what exactly will it do?
2006-11-22T12:04:00.000Z	rickyfingers	Eclypse	it's easy to use (gui) and it has internet connection sharing built in
2006-11-22T12:04:00.000Z	rickyfingers	Eclypse	it also will run dhcp server to the wireless router
2006-11-22T12:04:00.000Z	rickyfingers	Eclypse	makes everything easy.
2006-11-22T12:04:00.000Z	Eclypse	rickyfingers	I don't use DCHP
2006-11-22T12:05:00.000Z	Eclypse	rickyfingers	static works much better.
2006-11-22T12:05:00.000Z	rickyfingers	Eclypse	I'm just listing what you can do with it
2006-11-22T12:05:00.000Z	Eclypse	rickyfingers	ah ok
2006-11-22T12:05:00.000Z	Eclypse	rickyfingers	I'll try yours next if malt's doesn't work, his sounds better at the moment.
2006-11-22T12:06:00.000Z	rickyfingers	Eclypse	one very important detail: the machine that connects directly to dial up is running ubuntu, right?
2006-11-22T12:06:00.000Z	Eclypse	rickyfingers	no.
2006-11-22T12:06:00.000Z	Eclypse	rickyfingers	as I stated, it's running windows.
2006-11-22T12:07:00.000Z	Eclypse	rickyfingers	I used to use ubuntu, and I know this is a good community, that's why I'm here.
2006-11-22T12:07:00.000Z	rickyfingers	Eclypse	internet connection sharing doesn't work?
2006-11-22T12:07:00.000Z	Eclypse	rickyfingers	not through my router sadly, it worked well when I didn't have the router :P
