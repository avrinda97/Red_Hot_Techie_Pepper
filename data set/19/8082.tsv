2007-12-04T09:35:00.000Z	Fezzler		Sometimes when using Firefox, I click a link and my desktop completely clears, except for my background desktop image??
2007-12-04T09:35:00.000Z	Fezzler		GNOME menu is gone too?
2007-12-04T09:37:00.000Z	h1st0	Fezzler	sounds like a bug.  Can you reproduce the lock up?
2007-12-04T09:38:00.000Z	h1st0	Fezzler	also to recover you could try hitting alt+f2 to bring up a run prompt and restart gnome-panel.  Or you could hit ctrl+alt+backspace to restart X
2007-12-04T09:38:00.000Z	Fezzler	h1st0	Thanks!
2007-12-04T09:40:00.000Z	h1st0	Fezzler	well then probably gnome-panel crashed is all.
2007-12-04T09:41:00.000Z	h1st0	Fezzler	if you get a run dialog up you could do something like killall gnome-panel.  It should restart the panel up top on its own.
2007-12-04T09:42:00.000Z	h1st0	Fezzler	then just type in killall gnome-panel
2007-12-04T09:47:00.000Z	h1st0	Fezzler	why don't you run linux on the old computers
2007-12-04T09:49:00.000Z	Fezzler	h1st0	CP/M computer and old 8085/Z80 computers.  No room for Linux.  32k max rom/ram.  64k is a powerhouse :)
2007-12-04T09:49:00.000Z	h1st0	Fezzler	hrm...
2007-12-04T10:28:00.000Z	h1st0	Fezzler	register what your nick?
2007-12-04T10:28:00.000Z	h1st0	Fezzler	once you log in the freenode and identify yourself you are fine.
