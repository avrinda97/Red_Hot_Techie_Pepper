2006-08-30T14:35:00.000Z	Gooblakan		is there any way to detect devices connected to the parallel port?
2006-08-30T14:35:00.000Z	Gooblakan		or even a way to detect if my parallel port is supported?
2006-08-30T14:36:00.000Z	Gooblakan		frustrated
2006-08-30T14:37:00.000Z	Gooblakan		isn't fat 32 known for it's instability?
2006-08-30T14:39:00.000Z	vik	Gooblakan	what device?
2006-08-30T14:40:00.000Z	Gooblakan	vik	frankly, i'm not even sure if my kernel supports it....
2006-08-30T14:41:00.000Z	Gooblakan	vik	you there man?
2006-08-30T14:42:00.000Z	vik	Gooblakan	patience. Some of us multitask. type lsmod and see if parport and lp modules are there.
2006-08-30T14:44:00.000Z	Gooblakan	vik	sorry man, and thanks.
2006-08-30T14:44:00.000Z	Gooblakan	vik	 parport_pc             31812  1
2006-08-30T14:46:00.000Z	vik	Gooblakan	what device are you trying to connect?
2006-08-30T14:46:00.000Z	Gooblakan	vik	a scanner
2006-08-30T14:47:00.000Z	Gooblakan	vik	an artec scanner that is supposed to be supported by Xsane
2006-08-30T14:47:00.000Z	vik	Gooblakan	Hmm... dunno really.
2006-08-30T14:48:00.000Z	vik	Gooblakan	I don't think it will autodetect magically like USB
2006-08-30T14:48:00.000Z	vik	Gooblakan	you could always try a parallel printer to make sure the ports working (though it's unlikely that it isn't)
2006-08-30T14:48:00.000Z	Gooblakan	vik	any idea where to search for some help? perhaps a clever search string for google?
2006-08-30T14:49:00.000Z	vik	Gooblakan	and make sure your parport is set to ECP mode - you gotta do this in the BIOS
2006-08-30T14:49:00.000Z	Gooblakan	vik	hmm.... I'll give that a shot, thanks , be back shortly perhaps...
