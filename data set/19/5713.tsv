2008-05-13T13:03:00.000Z	haile		i upgraded from gusty to hardy and all the gusty repos are still in my source.list so my updater just crashes when i try to update. Is there a way i can change the repos in the source.list to the hardy repos ?
2008-05-13T13:04:00.000Z	bazhang	haile	sure open them gskudo gedit
2008-05-13T13:05:00.000Z	bazhang	haile	just replace gutsy with hardy unless third party
2009-06-29T15:39:00.000Z	bazhang	haile	watch the language
2009-06-29T15:41:00.000Z	bazhang	haile	it works fine on Sata
2009-06-29T15:45:00.000Z	bazhang	haile	check the md5 of the iso yet?
2009-06-29T15:45:00.000Z	bazhang	haile	check the md5 sum of the iso, reburn at low speed, do the disk integrity check
2009-06-29T15:46:00.000Z	bazhang	haile	looks like you got a bad burn/bad media
2009-06-29T15:47:00.000Z	bazhang	haile	do the disk integrity check then
2009-06-29T15:49:00.000Z	bazhang	haile	this is a wubi install?
2009-06-29T15:50:00.000Z	bazhang	haile	wubi and dual boot?
2009-06-29T15:50:00.000Z	bazhang	haile	wubi means you install inside windows; dual boot means you install next to windows
2009-06-29T15:51:00.000Z	bazhang	haile	that link above showed a wubi install
2009-06-29T15:52:00.000Z	bazhang	haile	that is wubi
2009-06-29T15:56:00.000Z	bazhang	haile	you should try booting the livecd, instead of wubi, to see how well it works
2009-06-29T15:56:00.000Z	bazhang	haile	I am trying to help you.
2009-06-29T15:57:00.000Z	bazhang	haile	okay.
2009-06-29T15:57:00.000Z	bazhang	haile	I know very little about wubi, perhaps someone else can assist you.
2009-06-29T15:57:00.000Z	haile	bazhang	so
