2010-05-15T01:59:00.000Z	Timon2		Voer tekst hier in...Hi
2010-05-15T02:00:00.000Z	Timon2		Somebody can help with my not working internet on Ubuntu?
2010-05-15T02:00:00.000Z	Timon2		The behaviour my internet shows is quite interesting, but annoying too
2010-05-15T02:01:00.000Z	Timon2		The problem is that i have done a rest on my router, and after that it stopped working
2010-05-15T02:01:00.000Z	Timon2		Everyone in the house can internet, except me\
2010-05-15T02:02:00.000Z	Timon2		Sometimes, with luck, i can connect to my network
2010-05-15T02:02:00.000Z	Timon2		And when it does, my internet still doesn't work, or really really slow
2010-05-15T02:02:00.000Z	Timon2		Somebody knows how it comes, or how to fix it?
2010-05-15T02:03:00.000Z	egc	Timon2	check /var/log/messages, maybe theres something interesting at the end
2010-05-15T02:05:00.000Z	Timon2	egc	is that i map i can find, or do i have to type it in the console?
2010-05-15T02:07:00.000Z	egc	Timon2	 u can do it a couple ways:  System->Administration->Log Viewer and look at the messages entry, or in a terminal type "sudo view /var/log/messages"
2010-05-15T02:07:00.000Z	egc	Timon2	view is the same as vi, but read-only
2010-05-15T02:08:00.000Z	Timon2	egc	and i am looking for what?
2010-05-15T02:09:00.000Z	egc	Timon2	if it were me i would look for messages that look like they came from the network subsystem, or drivers
2010-05-15T02:09:00.000Z	egc	Timon2	or just any messages that print around the time that you experience issues
2010-05-15T02:10:00.000Z	egc	Timon2	this helps narrow the issue
2010-05-15T02:11:00.000Z	Timon2		he seems to connect, to scan, and then disconnect a few times
2010-05-15T02:11:00.000Z	Timon2		And then, after a minute, he says something like fail because it takes to long. egc
2010-05-15T02:12:00.000Z	egc	Timon2	right, so that's the kind of message that would be helpful
