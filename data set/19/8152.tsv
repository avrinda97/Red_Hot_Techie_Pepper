2007-07-06T08:24:00.000Z	NigelS	iShock	hmm odd, is this a fresh install - have you changed anything?
2007-07-06T08:25:00.000Z	iShock	NigelS	I have had some odd problems lately, when I got to log in, I chaned session thingy to GNOME.
2007-07-06T08:25:00.000Z	NigelS	iShock	when you got to log in?
2007-07-06T08:25:00.000Z	NigelS	iShock	I mean what do you mean?
2007-07-06T08:25:00.000Z	NigelS	iShock	ah, you have to manually choose gnome?
2007-07-06T08:26:00.000Z	NigelS	iShock	what happens if you don't?
2007-07-06T08:26:00.000Z	iShock	NigelS	It stops doing anything and splash screen doesn't load, making Ubuntu not load. However, I was about to try and restart, should I?
2007-07-06T08:27:00.000Z	NigelS	iShock	what do you mean by restart? reboot or reinstall? and did you change anything before this started happening?
2007-07-06T08:29:00.000Z	iShock	NigelS	Reboot, should I?
2007-07-06T08:29:00.000Z	NigelS	iShock	has a reboot changed anything before?
2007-07-06T08:30:00.000Z	iShock	NigelS	Well, TBH, the last time I did is when problem started...I shall try it again though
