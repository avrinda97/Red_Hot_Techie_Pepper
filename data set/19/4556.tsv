2008-12-20T18:35:00.000Z	dev12341234		I have a 28" viewsonic screen running at 1920x1200, and an nvidia 9800GT - all runs fine. Vista needed the latest nvidia driver to support this monitor
2008-12-20T18:35:00.000Z	dev12341234		When I enable restricted drivers, two things happen
2008-12-20T18:35:00.000Z	dev12341234		the gamma gets knocked out, and the screen is very dark
2008-12-20T18:35:00.000Z	dev12341234		the second thing is the same as what happened on vista, the screen is zoomed... it gets the right reslution but dirplsyas it nicorewnt
2008-12-20T18:37:00.000Z	dev12341234		that was meant to say 'but it displays it incorrectly
2008-12-20T18:38:00.000Z	dev12341234		not only has the manufacturer *(*$($ up a keyboard I used to buy, and made it spongy (same model, now spongy and unusable) but this nvidia thing is nanoying
2008-12-20T18:39:00.000Z	dev12341234		Why is ubuntu showing a google custom search?
2008-12-20T18:40:00.000Z	dev12341234		that is completely broken, why would one OS have a different google? how pointless is that - is it a money thing? (I realise it is a default)
2008-12-20T18:40:00.000Z	dev12341234		thus can be changed
2008-12-20T18:40:00.000Z	white-sheep	dev12341234	Yeah.  It's a money thing. ;)
2008-12-20T18:42:00.000Z	white-sheep	dev12341234	-- You can change it.
2008-12-20T18:42:00.000Z	dev12341234	white-sheep	spectacular deduction. What helped you? The part where I said 'obviously' previously, or  your immense intellect. Now, since the argument isn't about whether you can change it, why would that even enter into the conversation?
2008-12-20T18:43:00.000Z	white-sheep	dev12341234	-- Don't cry over a spilled milk.
2008-12-20T18:43:00.000Z	dev12341234	white-sheep	no I am crying over my 28" monitor having some issue with nvidia card and taking resolution but 'zooming' it
2008-12-20T18:45:00.000Z	white-sheep	dev12341234	-- I'm only here for social // to help people if I can -- Check your resolution -- Is it same resolution as you expected it would be for your said monitor?
2008-12-20T18:45:00.000Z	dev12341234	white-sheep	and the issue isn't me whining about the custom search, it is just a direct criticism with reasoning, I don't care either way, but it will annoy users
2008-12-20T18:45:00.000Z	dev12341234	white-sheep	no everything is ok, as I said
2008-12-20T18:46:00.000Z	white-sheep	dev12341234	-- Good. ;)
2008-12-20T18:52:00.000Z	white-sheep	dev12341234	-- Sounds like an antisocial issue.
