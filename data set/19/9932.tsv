2009-10-18T10:16:00.000Z	wookienz		if i install gub using root (hd0,0) does this mean my devoce needs to be hda or can it be sda/
2009-10-18T10:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	wookienz	 hda used to refer to ide drives.. and sda  scsi or sata - but now a days sda is used  for ide drives also.  you rarely see hdXX used.
2010-01-04T07:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	wookienz	 theres books on using samba in the repios. and many samba tutortial pages. :)
2010-01-04T07:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	wookienz	 one tip - DONT use spaces in share names on the windows machine
2010-01-04T07:54:00.000Z	wookienz	Dr_Willis	yes learned about spaces the hard way! i have just moved to Koala GUI - usually only CLI for m other nix machines. So just trying to get used to the GUI nuances of nix now.
2010-01-04T07:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	wookienz	 thers some trick to using spaces in share names in fstab.. but i forget what the trick is/was now.. :)
2010-01-04T07:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	wookienz	 that will NOT work for a samba share in fstab...
2010-01-04T07:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	wookienz	 theres some other sequence thats needed...
2010-07-06T16:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	wookienz	 you may want to 'dd' it to a file if you want to 'archive' it . theres other tools that can also do that task.
2010-07-06T16:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	wookienz	 you can dd one hd to another of larger size and it 'should' work. but dding it BACK can be an issue. (thus the use of a file)
2010-07-06T16:53:00.000Z	wookienz	Dr_Willis	ok thanks.
2010-07-06T16:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	wookienz	 also using dd with a hard drive PARTITION is  more commonly done to 'archive' a partition.  unless you really want a clone of the whole hard drive - including  the mbnr, swap, and otehr partitions in one swoop
2010-07-06T16:55:00.000Z	wookienz	Dr_Willis	yes i want to image the whole drive so i can switch to a different OS for a short time to try and fix my fakeraid issue, then go back to ubuntu
2010-07-06T16:59:00.000Z	wookienz	Dr_Willis	from what i understand fakeraid is from bios controller chips and the like, and software raid is through nix sftware using mdadm etc
2010-07-06T17:05:00.000Z	wookienz	Dr_Willis	can i dd my OS drive while the OS is running?
2010-07-06T17:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	wookienz	 short answer.. You dont.
2010-07-06T17:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	wookienz	 use a live cd. theres several out with many disk imageing/recovery/restore tools included
2010-07-06T17:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	wookienz	  think about it.. :)
2010-07-06T17:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	wookienz	 you are dding a drive.. somthing writes to the first part of the hd. (a log or somthing) and then your dd image.. is then wrong.
