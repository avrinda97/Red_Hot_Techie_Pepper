2012-03-04T01:03:00.000Z	LukeNukem		my ip is renewing
2012-03-04T01:03:00.000Z	LukeNukem		how can i stop this
2012-03-04T01:04:00.000Z	tr33m4n	LukeNukem	surely that's to do with dhcp on your router?
2012-03-04T01:04:00.000Z	LukeNukem	tr33m4n	any idea on how to disable it or something
2012-03-04T01:04:00.000Z	LukeNukem		i use DLINK
2012-03-04T01:05:00.000Z	tr33m4n	LukeNukem	you can define a static ip in /etc/network/interfaces
2012-03-04T01:05:00.000Z	tr33m4n	LukeNukem	for the router I'd recommend leaving it on, however there should be an option to reserve ips based on your computers mac address
2012-03-04T01:06:00.000Z	tr33m4n	LukeNukem	leaving dhcp on that is
2012-03-04T01:06:00.000Z	LukeNukem	tr33m4n	its not that, on my router i have certain rules to 192.168.1.2 (apache and so on) if the shit keeps changing ip adress
2012-03-04T01:06:00.000Z	LukeNukem		the rules are ignored
2012-03-04T01:06:00.000Z	LukeNukem		i need to change ip adress to the correct one after checking in ifconfig every damn time

2012-03-04T01:07:00.000Z	tr33m4n	LukeNukem	so you have http:80 etc pointing at a specific IP, but you want your server to have that IP everytime you boot up right?
2012-03-04T01:08:00.000Z	LukeNukem	tr33m4n	yes
2012-03-04T01:08:00.000Z	tr33m4n	LukeNukem	have a look here http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/howto-ubuntu-linux-convert-dhcp-network-configuration-to-static-ip-configuration.html
2012-03-04T01:09:00.000Z	tr33m4n	LukeNukem	you will need to add some extra settings to /etc/network/interfaces which will reserve the ip for that computer
2012-03-04T01:10:00.000Z	tr33m4n	LukeNukem	you shouldn't have to bother with the DNS part
