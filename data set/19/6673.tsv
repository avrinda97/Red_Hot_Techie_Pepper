2008-01-02T05:08:00.000Z	Marfi	aswear	sudo dhcpcd <device>
2008-01-02T05:09:00.000Z	Marfi	aswear	yes?  =)
2008-01-02T05:09:00.000Z	aswear	Marfi	device is eth0 ??
2008-01-02T05:10:00.000Z	Marfi	aswear	sorry, missed it. it should be
2008-01-02T05:10:00.000Z	Marfi	aswear	never used it
2008-01-02T05:12:00.000Z	aswear	Marfi	- it says dhcpcd is not a command
2008-01-02T05:12:00.000Z	Marfi	aswear	you may have to install the package. reboot possibly?
2008-01-02T05:13:00.000Z	Marfi	aswear	or unplug the cord, plug it back in. eth0 may also be down. you could try sudo ifconfig eth0 up
2008-01-02T05:18:00.000Z	aswear	Marfi	- sorry, one more thing, how do i get dhcpcd from the install cd??
2008-01-02T05:18:00.000Z	Marfi	aswear	sudo apt-get install dhcpcd
2008-01-02T05:37:00.000Z	Marfi	aswear	sudo mount /dev/cdrom0 /media/cdrom
2008-01-02T05:38:00.000Z	Marfi	aswear	you may have to use the filesystem if you know it. sudo mount -t <Filesystem> /dev/cdrom /media/cdrom
2008-01-02T05:38:00.000Z	Marfi	aswear	and when typign...tab is your friend
2008-01-02T05:40:00.000Z	aswear	Marfi	- how is tab my friend??
2008-01-02T05:41:00.000Z	Marfi	aswear	whenever typing in the terminal, you can type a few letters then hit tab, and it will finish the rest for you. for example, i run wow from the terminal...but it would take a good 3 minutes to type everything with the escape characters. i can type "Wo [tab]" and it will finish the rest for me. using tab in the terminal cuts your time, its just a shortcut
2008-01-02T05:47:00.000Z	Marfi	aswear	yessm? =)
2008-01-02T05:48:00.000Z	aswear	Marfi	- i'm not connected to the internet, but even when I mount the cdrom at /media/cdrom apt-get does not find the dhcpcd package
2008-01-02T05:48:00.000Z	Marfi	aswear	it will have to be installed from a cd, or from a thumb drive if you have one
