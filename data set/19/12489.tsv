2005-08-29T10:27:00.000Z	Milk	Dr_Willis	I'm trying to get shares setup using the wiki guide via the networking gui.. but I don't have options for windows networking
2005-08-29T10:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Milk	 hmm... i cant actually recall using the gui. im not even sure that the samba servers are installed by default.
2005-08-29T10:29:00.000Z	Milk	Dr_Willis	I used apt-get to install samba
2005-08-29T10:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Milk	 did you start the service? did ya do a 'smbpasswd -a USERNAME' for your users?
2005-08-29T10:33:00.000Z	Milk	Dr_Willis	its not starting
2005-08-29T10:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Milk	 then whats it doing dare i ask.. :P
2005-08-29T10:34:00.000Z	Milk	Dr_Willis	not sure, its failing.. checking the logs now
2005-08-29T10:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Milk	 ya could just edit the samba config manually :P
2005-08-29T10:36:00.000Z	Milk	Dr_Willis	my brain isn't up to manual tonight
2005-08-29T10:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Milk	 its one of the most trivial config files out. :P   in fact i think the default is 90# commants..
2005-08-29T10:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Milk	 the book (online) of 'using samba' is dang handy also. to read when ya got the time
2005-08-29T10:37:00.000Z	Milk	Dr_Willis	I will, thanks!
