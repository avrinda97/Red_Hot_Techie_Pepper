2005-04-26T15:08:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Absenth	what is ids ??
2005-04-26T15:08:00.000Z	Absenth	LinuxJones	Intrusion Detection System (ie configuring it for Snort/Acid)
2005-04-26T15:12:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Absenth	sorry was afk there is aide but I wouldn't run it if your going to run the testing branch (too many file changes)
2005-04-26T15:13:00.000Z	Absenth	LinuxJones	Aide is great for auditing the security of the linux computer itself.  What I'm shooting for is an IDS on the internet connection.  Ie, Eth0 has no IP, is in Promisc. and listens to all traffic outside the firewall to detect things like portscans, etc etc etc.
2005-04-26T15:18:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Absenth	sorry dude I am running around the house :P ..... you can install a few things to help keep an eye on your system. Aide, Firestarter (firewall gui which is a bit like zone alarm),Portmap, chkrootkit (searches for installe rootkits)
2005-04-26T15:19:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Absenth	are you running many different services on your network ?
2005-04-26T15:20:00.000Z	Absenth	LinuxJones	this is for work....  We have I believe 30 World avalible IP addresses all funneled through a PIX 515,  The goal of the IDS is to watch all the traffic that's on the outside of the pix.  It's not because I want to guard the linux box persay (although having the outside interface deny all is a pretty good idea)
2005-04-26T15:23:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Absenth	there are dedicated distros that might be a better choice than Ubuntu.
2005-04-26T15:24:00.000Z	Absenth	LinuxJones	I kinda figured.  Looking into some of those now.

2005-05-23T06:37:00.000Z	Absenth	LinuxJones	won't boot to usb, or I'd have slapped a cdrom on it :).
2005-05-23T06:37:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Absenth	argh
