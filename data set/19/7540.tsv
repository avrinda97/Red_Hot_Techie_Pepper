2007-08-10T12:32:00.000Z	neozen	bmachine	for lightweight systems, I prefer xfce
2007-08-10T12:33:00.000Z	bmachine	neozen	xface eh?
2007-08-10T12:33:00.000Z	neozen	bmachine	aye, xfce
2007-08-10T12:33:00.000Z	neozen		goes like hell on this 1.4ghz
2007-08-10T12:33:00.000Z	neozen		though I suppose anything would..
2007-08-10T12:34:00.000Z	bmachine	neozen	does it minimalize the work area ?
2007-08-10T12:34:00.000Z	neozen	bmachine	what do you mean?
2007-08-10T12:35:00.000Z	neozen	bmachine	you can have it take up as much or as little as you want
2007-08-10T12:35:00.000Z	neozen	bmachine	think of it as anemic gnome... that still supports gtk themes
2007-08-10T12:35:00.000Z	bmachine	neozen	well fluxbox focalizes in just giving your right click on desktop option to open your files apps, etc.
2007-08-10T12:36:00.000Z	bmachine	neozen	makes it cleaner and gives more window to use
2007-08-10T12:36:00.000Z	neozen		I've found the notes one particularly useful
2007-08-10T12:37:00.000Z	neozen		and the themes.. sooo pretty
2007-08-10T12:37:00.000Z	bmachine	neozen	i think i'll try it
2007-08-10T12:38:00.000Z	neozen	bmachine	you'll find a shot of what mine used to look like before I stripped it down here: http://neozen.homelinux.org/index.png
