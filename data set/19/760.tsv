2011-09-07T18:16:00.000Z	meowsus		I'm sure a lot of you guys use Chromium Browser. I was wondering if anyone else is having problems with getting Flash to work. I've tried the steps outlined here, to no avail: http://www.ubuntugeek.com/howto-enable-flash-support-for-google-chromium-browser.html
2011-09-07T18:17:00.000Z	archae	meowsus	I'm running natty on latest version of chromium, having no issues with flash for the record
2011-09-07T18:18:00.000Z	meowsus	archae	so /usr/lib/chromium-browser/plugins/ contains the flash plugin .so file?
2011-09-07T18:19:00.000Z	archae	meowsus	.../plugins is empty on my drive.
2011-09-07T18:20:00.000Z	meowsus	archae	hmmm... but you download from the dailys?
2011-09-07T18:20:00.000Z	archae	meowsus	No, I am saying that flash is working fine w/o any non-vanilla plugins from the chromium base download.
2011-09-07T18:21:00.000Z	meowsus	archae	hm...
2011-09-07T18:32:00.000Z	meowsus	archae	https://launchpad.net/~chromium-daily/+archive/ppa right from the source. The dailys focus on using integrated solutions, rather than sym-linking or copying the plugin to the plugin directory
2011-09-07T18:36:00.000Z	archae	meowsus	my mistake, I am not running the latest release. My fault for thinking the default repository would have it. I'm currently on 12.0.742.112 (90304) Ubuntu 11.04; will download latest and let you know how it goes
2011-09-07T18:37:00.000Z	meowsus	archae	ah, right on. Yeah repos would never have the most recent version of any highly developed app. That's Windows logic you're using there ;)
2011-09-07T18:40:00.000Z	archae	meowsus	does flash perform in firefox/other browsers?
2011-09-07T18:42:00.000Z	meowsus	archae	of course :)
2011-09-07T18:43:00.000Z	archae	meowsus	he means to type about:version in your address bar and post the version number stated for flash
2011-09-07T18:48:00.000Z	archae	meowsus	run chromium from the terminal and see what error is reported when flash crashes
2011-09-07T18:48:00.000Z	meowsus	archae	good idea
2011-09-07T18:53:00.000Z	archae	meowsus	try running chromium with the -g flag
2011-09-07T18:53:00.000Z	meowsus	archae	i did, but it wouldn't launch the browser. It goes into some strange shell... like... window...
2011-09-07T18:54:00.000Z	meowsus	archae	and i'm looking at that page. The player may have had inproper permissions
2011-09-07T18:58:00.000Z	archae	meowsus	have you tried the instructions @ http://pastebin.com/yevpWg1H  ?
