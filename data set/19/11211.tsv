2006-03-19T13:12:00.000Z	A10n		hey guys
2006-03-19T13:12:00.000Z	A10n		when i try to do apt-get update i get a warning about packages that can't be authenticated.
2006-03-19T13:13:00.000Z	A10n		WARNING: The following packages cannot be authenticated!

2006-03-19T13:13:00.000Z	A10n		any advice? is my apt sources un trusted?
2006-03-19T13:13:00.000Z	jetscreamer	A10n	long as you trust the source, it's ok. you'll need a gpg key for the server to fix that
2006-03-19T13:14:00.000Z	jetscreamer	A10n	but you can install the programs, it will work
2006-03-19T13:14:00.000Z	A10n		yes i know but don't know if i trust them. let me check my sources really quick
2006-03-19T13:15:00.000Z	A10n		i had everything with ubuntu.com and one line that had debian
2006-03-19T13:15:00.000Z	A10n	jetscreamer	I guess having a line that said debian.com is a mistake huh?
2006-03-19T13:16:00.000Z	jetscreamer	A10n	ahhh....
2006-03-19T13:16:00.000Z	jetscreamer	A10n	no don't mix debian and ubuntu sources
2006-03-19T13:17:00.000Z	A10n		okay i thought it would be okay. I wonder whyi put it there in the first place...
2006-03-19T13:17:00.000Z	A10n	jetscreamer	is there a way to check if i installed anythign from the debian repository?
2006-03-19T13:18:00.000Z	A10n		looks like you guys put out a new kernel
2006-03-19T13:19:00.000Z	jetscreamer	A10n	yes, but i don't know how exactly. (you don't know?) one way would be to comment out the debian line, use a front end like (gasp) dselect or aptitude synaptic and see what winds up 'orphaned'... that's not the exact term, but you can tell the orphan state when you see it.
2006-03-19T13:19:00.000Z	jetscreamer		then just uninstall those
2006-03-19T13:19:00.000Z	jetscreamer		unless you did an upgrade :(
2006-03-19T13:20:00.000Z	A10n	jetscreamer	okay :/ i think i messed around with installing flash for mozilla firefox but its not that big of a deal
