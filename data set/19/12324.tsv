2005-09-20T11:29:00.000Z	jakelo		Hmm... it seems I can ssh and http into the machine but I can't seem to get out other than ping.  Anyone know what might be wrong?
2005-09-20T11:31:00.000Z	bob2	jakelo	your problem is just that you can't get out fro ma machine aside from ping?
2005-09-20T11:31:00.000Z	jakelo	bob2	that seems to be the issue
2005-09-20T11:32:00.000Z	bob2	jakelo	is it an ubuntu machine?
2005-09-20T11:33:00.000Z	jakelo	bob2	yup
2005-09-20T11:33:00.000Z	bob2	jakelo	default settings? ie, no manually setup firewall?
2005-09-20T11:34:00.000Z	jakelo	bob2	 there was no firewall that was set up that I know of.
2005-09-20T11:35:00.000Z	bob2	jakelo	can you ssh to other machines on the same lane?
2005-09-20T11:36:00.000Z	bob2	jakelo	but you can ping other machines on the lan, and on the interweb?
2005-09-20T11:36:00.000Z	jakelo	bob2	yup
2005-09-20T11:38:00.000Z	jakelo	bob2	ideas?
2005-09-20T11:38:00.000Z	bob2	jakelo	did it used to work?
2005-09-20T11:41:00.000Z	bob2	jakelo	what did you change since it last worked?
2005-09-20T11:46:00.000Z	jakelo	bob2	do you have any other ideas or at least point me in a direction?  I'm out of ideas, (other than reinstall.)
2005-09-20T11:47:00.000Z	bob2	jakelo	if someone else had root, it could be anything
2005-09-20T11:48:00.000Z	jakelo	bob2	 I figure it might be bind with what I've read... but I don't knwo what bind does.
2005-09-20T11:48:00.000Z	bob2	jakelo	no, bind does not have the ability to randomly drop packets
2005-09-20T11:49:00.000Z	jakelo	bob2	 not random.... happening each time.
2005-09-20T11:49:00.000Z	bob2	jakelo	bind does not have that ability
