2005-09-29T12:59:00.000Z	djjason		does anyone know why I am getting "dpkg-deb: subprocess paste killed by signal (Broken pipe)" when I am trying to update firefox
2005-09-29T12:59:00.000Z	bob2	djjason	that's not the whole error, show us the whole thing in #flood
2005-09-29T13:00:00.000Z	bob2	djjason	if you're using the broken firefox "backport", that could explain it
2005-09-29T13:01:00.000Z	djjason	bob2	I didnt change anything ...I just got a message that updates were available for firefox and tried to install them and then I got this error...which I will paste in #flood now
2005-09-29T13:03:00.000Z	bob2	djjason	sudo dpkg --purge --force-depends firefox firefox-gnome-support ; sudo apt-get install firefox firefox-gnome-support
2005-09-29T13:05:00.000Z	djjason	bob2	when I perform the install it complains that package firefox does not exist
2005-09-29T13:06:00.000Z	djjason	bob2	isnt the package mozilla-firefox
2005-09-29T13:06:00.000Z	bob2	djjason	it is in ubuntu, but not in the backports
2005-09-29T13:06:00.000Z	bob2	djjason	what does "dpkg -l firefox | tail -n1" print out?
2005-09-29T13:08:00.000Z	djjason	bob2	its fixed...I did your purge and then fixed the broken packages and it works now
2005-09-29T13:09:00.000Z	djjason	bob2	thanks alot bob2

2005-10-31T09:41:00.000Z	bob2	djjason	'sudo /etc/init.d/powernowd start' fails?
2005-10-31T09:42:00.000Z	djjason	bob2	it seems to work fine if I start it myself
2005-10-31T09:42:00.000Z	bob2	djjason	is it in /etc/rc2.d or /etc/rcS.d?
2005-10-31T09:44:00.000Z	djjason	bob2	in rc2.d there is a S20powernowd
2005-10-31T09:45:00.000Z	bob2	djjason	do you see any output of it at boot?
