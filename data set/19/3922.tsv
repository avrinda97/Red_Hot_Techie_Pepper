2009-10-06T03:29:00.000Z	_Tristan		you can still get it if you fix my problem ;)
2009-10-06T03:31:00.000Z	_Tristan		see, but I like 9.04 a lot.
2009-10-06T03:31:00.000Z	sebsebseb	_Tristan	Somtimes an older reason of  Ubuntu is actsauly better for someone, because of the hardware they have for example
2009-10-06T03:31:00.000Z	sebsebseb	_Tristan	9.10 is out on October 29th :)
2009-10-06T03:31:00.000Z	_Tristan	sebsebseb	I got it working before
2009-10-06T03:32:00.000Z	sebsebseb	_Tristan	yes it is
2009-10-06T03:32:00.000Z	_Tristan	sebsebseb	I don't suppose I could search the logs?
2009-10-06T03:33:00.000Z	sebsebseb	_Tristan	it seems that they can't easilley be searched, and you might have your own IRC client log for that
2009-10-06T03:33:00.000Z	_Tristan	sebsebseb	tried that
2010-02-01T05:05:00.000Z	sebsebseb	_Tristan	uhmm probably not
2010-02-01T05:06:00.000Z	sebsebseb	_Tristan	did you just upgrade from 9.04 to 9.10?
2010-02-01T05:06:00.000Z	_Tristan	sebsebseb	no. I did that months ago. Update manager just finished installing then all themes disappeared.
2010-02-01T05:06:00.000Z	sebsebseb	_Tristan	ok odd
2010-02-01T05:06:00.000Z	sebsebseb	_Tristan	maybe if you log out and back in again they are there again though
2010-02-01T05:06:00.000Z	_Tristan	sebsebseb	any way to revert an update?
2010-02-01T05:07:00.000Z	sebsebseb	_Tristan	don't think you can just undo an update
2010-02-01T08:43:00.000Z	_Tristan	sebsebseb	I fixed the wireless
2010-02-01T08:41:00.000Z	sebsebseb	_Tristan	there was someon earlier with a similar issue, or the same issue, unless that was you as well?
2010-02-01T08:41:00.000Z	_Tristan	sebsebseb	that was me, you told me to restart, it did nothing but break my wireless.
