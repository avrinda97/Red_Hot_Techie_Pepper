2007-12-20T03:31:00.000Z	backgen		anybody know about installing Ubuntu from live CD onto partition created by Gparted?
2007-12-20T03:31:00.000Z	Phusion	backgen	should just be able to select the partition you made
2007-12-20T03:33:00.000Z	Phusion	backgen	you need to define the root partition :) you need to put a / in the mount point
2007-12-20T03:34:00.000Z	Phusion	backgen	/ is the root partition, so you need to edit it w/ the livecd
2007-12-20T03:34:00.000Z	backgen	Phusion	ok so how do i do that?
2007-12-20T03:34:00.000Z	Phusion	backgen	in the installer, you can select manual partition editing, for the "Mount Point" field, type in a  /
2007-12-20T03:35:00.000Z	backgen	Phusion	ok so just a "/" and nothing else?
2007-12-20T03:36:00.000Z	backgen	Phusion	alrighty then, let me give it a whirl...now i have another partition that's NTFS and that has my windows on it...none of this should affect it right?
2007-12-20T03:36:00.000Z	Phusion	backgen	as long as you select manual partition editing, and you don't edit your NTFS partitions, you're fine
2007-12-20T03:37:00.000Z	backgen	Phusion	ok i just got a warning saying this: File system doesn't have expected sizes for Windows to like it. Cluster size is 2k (1k expected); number of clusters is 24026 (47959 expected); size of FATs is 94 sectors (188 expected).....will this do any damage to my computer?
2007-12-20T03:37:00.000Z	Phusion	backgen	what's telling you that?
2007-12-20T03:37:00.000Z	backgen	Phusion	eek! the Ubuntu installer
2007-12-20T03:38:00.000Z	Phusion	backgen	yikes, well, I don't want to be responsible for any lost data, not sure how you should procede
2007-12-20T03:53:00.000Z	Phusion	backgen	looks like you have NTFS and FAT32 partitions, with a restore partition by dell
2007-12-20T03:53:00.000Z	backgen	Phusion	yeah and i want to install Ubuntu in the FAT32 partition
2007-12-20T03:53:00.000Z	Phusion	backgen	you mean you want to delete it and install linux there?
2007-12-20T03:54:00.000Z	Phusion	backgen	you dont install to the fat partition, you install an ext3 partition in its place for linux
2007-12-20T05:10:00.000Z	backgen	Phusion	hey phusion....its very confusing...and so far i dont think i have any OS that works on my system...or my hard disk is fried...which would really piss me off
2007-12-20T05:11:00.000Z	Phusion	backgen	yeah, it sounded like you had some serious data corruption issues
