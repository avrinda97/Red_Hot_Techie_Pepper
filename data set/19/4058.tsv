2009-04-11T05:13:00.000Z	RedMushroom		used on linux
2009-04-11T05:13:00.000Z	centHOGGr	RedMushroom	yeah I've use it a few times I think.. do you have all 3 components loaded up?
2009-04-11T05:14:00.000Z	centHOGGr	RedMushroom	on your client side
2009-04-11T05:14:00.000Z	RedMushroom		well, on the linux box i installed all of the available components listed in the package manager, so i'm assuming i do.
2009-04-11T05:14:00.000Z	RedMushroom		on the client side, i dunno. i had to d/l the client from a third party source (cnet) because the nomachine site wouldn't send it
2009-04-11T05:14:00.000Z	centHOGGr	RedMushroom	ok lemme that site out to refresh brb
2009-04-11T05:15:00.000Z	RedMushroom	centHOGGr	say what?
2009-04-11T05:16:00.000Z	centHOGGr	RedMushroom	ok you've loaded client node server right?
2009-04-11T05:16:00.000Z	centHOGGr		DEBs
2009-04-11T05:16:00.000Z	centHOGGr		3 DEBs
2009-04-11T05:17:00.000Z	RedMushroom		i dunno. i'm able to setup a connection to the remote machine, login, and see gnome in the nx window. i'm also able to use this normally, but i'm wanting to be able to see what windows i left open on the remote desktop, not just a new login
2009-04-11T05:18:00.000Z	centHOGGr	RedMushroom	heh, sorry I really haven't messed with it that intensly, but I got connectivity though
