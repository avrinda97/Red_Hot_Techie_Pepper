2008-10-01T13:32:00.000Z	Blinkiz		Hi. I have a question. If I forget to turn on my hardware wireless radio switch at boot, my network is not working. Okay. If I then turn the radio switch on, it takes up to 10 minutes before networkmanager is rescanning and connects to my accesspoint. My question is, how can I force networkmanager (or ubuntu) to scan for AP's? I have tried "sudo iwlist wlan0 scanning" but that does only work when am connected(?!?)
2008-10-01T13:33:00.000Z	Sdz	Blinkiz	iwconfig ?
2008-10-01T13:34:00.000Z	Blinkiz	Sdz	Yeah, and then?
2008-10-01T13:34:00.000Z	Sdz	Blinkiz	well, do u see ur hardware?
2008-10-01T13:34:00.000Z	Blinkiz	Sdz	Yeah, sure, np
2008-10-01T13:36:00.000Z	Blinkiz	Sdz	I can probably connect manually to the accesspoint with iwconfig. But that is not what I want. Its hard also because network is wpa-eps.
2008-10-01T13:37:00.000Z	Blinkiz	Sdz	I want networkmanager (or ubuntu) to scan the air again for wireless accesspoints. Its only doing that every 10 minute or so..
2008-10-01T13:37:00.000Z	Sdz	Blinkiz	i never tried to get scan results through command line :P all i know is that even when u dont see the net it lets you connect, thats enough for me
2008-10-01T13:38:00.000Z	Sdz	Blinkiz	afaik the network manager will work much better with 8.10 for wireless networks, so maybe we shall wait & see
2008-10-01T13:38:00.000Z	Blinkiz	Sdz	Try "sudo iwlist wlan0 scanning" and you see what I mean.
2008-10-01T13:39:00.000Z	Blinkiz	Sdz	Maybe restart of networkmanager will do the trick? How do I restart networkmanager?
2008-10-01T13:40:00.000Z	Sdz	Blinkiz	i don't know... it shall work better in a month with the new one. Maybe there's a command to restart manager and then it will scan when it starts ?

2008-10-01T13:48:00.000Z	Sdz	Blinkiz	still alive? saw the link i sent you?
2008-10-01T13:49:00.000Z	Blinkiz	Sdz	No, did not see it. Scrolling...

2008-10-01T13:50:00.000Z	Blinkiz	Sdz	Na, that does not work. NetworkManager is not rescanning the network. Probably because networkmanager is not restarted with that command
2008-10-01T13:51:00.000Z	Blinkiz	Sdz	Think the solution to my problem is to kill "NetworkManager" and "NetworkManagerD" and start these two up again.
2008-10-01T13:52:00.000Z	Sdz	Blinkiz	isnt there a "network-manager" command? maybe call it with --kill or --restart ?
