2004-10-26T10:33:00.000Z	z2nOnly		hello all, does the rc of ubuntu now install xorg or is it still xfree86?
2004-10-26T10:33:00.000Z	wm_eddie	z2nOnly	xOrg is for next year's release.
2004-10-26T10:34:00.000Z	z2nOnly	wm_eddie	thanks for the info
2004-10-26T10:34:00.000Z	z2nOnly	wm_eddie	any ideas when next year?
2004-10-26T10:35:00.000Z	wm_eddie	z2nOnly	you don't read the site do you? 5.3
2004-10-26T10:35:00.000Z	z2nOnly	wm_eddie	i will go there now and read up on, thanks!
2004-10-26T10:41:00.000Z	z2nOnly	wm_eddie	i have a pc with ati radeon 9800, will this be difficult to install after installing rc ubuntu?
2004-10-26T10:43:00.000Z	wm_eddie	z2nOnly	good question.  It worked fine on my nVidia.
2004-10-26T10:44:00.000Z	z2nOnly	wm_eddie	i thought i read that only nvidia was supported, however, was curious if rc supports ati now
2004-10-26T10:45:00.000Z	wm_eddie	z2nOnly	let me check the wiki
2004-10-26T10:45:00.000Z	z2nOnly	wm_eddie	thanks
2004-10-26T10:47:00.000Z	wm_eddie	z2nOnly	I see the the Radeon 9500 not only works but is auto-detected.
2004-10-26T10:47:00.000Z	z2nOnly	wm_eddie	thanks, i will try tomorrow
2004-10-26T10:48:00.000Z	wm_eddie	z2nOnly	if you do get it to work add a row to http://wiki.ubuntulinux.org/HardwareSupport
2004-10-26T10:48:00.000Z	z2nOnly	wm_eddie	will do
2004-10-26T10:56:00.000Z	z2nOnly	wm_eddie	i just looked at the wiki hardware support and did not see my laptop (gateway solo 5350) which i tried installing ubuntu on several weeks ago.  after successfully booting from the ubuntu cd and watching the hardware detection begin, screen went blank and nothing else happened.  any ideas?
2004-10-26T10:56:00.000Z	wm_eddie	z2nOnly	you got me there, perhaps you should disable auto-detection?
2004-10-26T10:57:00.000Z	z2nOnly	wm_eddie	how does one do that?
2004-10-26T10:57:00.000Z	wm_eddie	z2nOnly	I don't know, I've never had to do it :)
