2011-01-11T15:30:00.000Z	skilz		when I click on Appearence Preferences > Visual Effects > Normal or Extra it says searching for drivers
2011-01-11T15:31:00.000Z	skilz		then it hangs when I try to press Close
2011-01-11T15:31:00.000Z	skilz		I don't think the Nvidia drivers are working I installed
2011-01-11T15:33:00.000Z	skilz		Now I get the error: The Composite extension is not available.
2011-01-11T15:34:00.000Z	skilz		when I click on Appearence Preferences > Visual Effects > Normal or Extra it says searching for drivers, then I get the error "The Composite extension is not available"...... Any ideas how to fix this? I think the nvidia drivers I installed may not be working correctly

2011-01-11T15:38:00.000Z	skilz	histo	Geforce 210 Galaxy, Ubuntu searched for the driver and downloaded it and installed
