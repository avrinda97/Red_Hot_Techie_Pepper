2010-04-12T15:33:00.000Z	maginot	Arunomi	did you tried using fsck.vfat on that partition ?
2010-04-12T15:36:00.000Z	maginot	Arunomi	okay, you don't seen to be listen on what I'm telling you. Did you run fsck.vfat on that disk already?
2010-04-12T15:37:00.000Z	maginot	Arunomi	go to pastebin.com and post something and paste the link here.
2010-04-12T15:41:00.000Z	maginot	Arunomi	you can choose first or second, don't matter, it will just show what is wrong, if you use "-r" switch then it will make changes, so just choose the first option and wait the result to see what it shows you
2010-04-12T15:43:00.000Z	maginot	Arunomi	Hmmm don't know yet, can be relative to your disk size, you said 1.5tb, right?
2010-04-12T15:46:00.000Z	maginot	Arunomi	did you tried using any MS tool? After all fat partitions are MS
2010-04-12T15:51:00.000Z	maginot	Arunomi	Did you tried the first ( 1 ) option?
2010-04-12T15:52:00.000Z	maginot	Arunomi	and, did you tried using any microsoft util ? like check disk (is this the right name?) ?
2010-04-12T15:54:00.000Z	maginot	Arunomi	well, maybe someone else have a better idea, but if fsck is returning with a malloc problem, I really suggest you to try some MS tool or some fat32 specialized tool. Sorry can't help anymore.
