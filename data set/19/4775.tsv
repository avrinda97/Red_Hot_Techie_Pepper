2008-11-18T21:21:00.000Z	SOURdiesel		as far as increasing my swap partition, i don't know if i feel comfortable booting from live cd, increasing partition and interupting the install.  is there a way to disable the partition, increase the size, then re enable?
2008-11-18T21:21:00.000Z	hwilde	SOURdiesel	why do you wnat to increase swap?
2008-11-18T21:23:00.000Z	hwilde	SOURdiesel	ok so you have to shutdown, boot into livecd, run gparted, and resize your swap partition.
2008-11-18T21:25:00.000Z	hwilde	SOURdiesel	run without making changes.  it just runs off the cd
2008-11-18T21:26:00.000Z	hwilde	SOURdiesel	you can't resize your partitions while they are active.  that is why you boot from livecd
2008-11-18T21:27:00.000Z	hwilde	SOURdiesel	how did you get into gparted ?
2008-11-18T21:29:00.000Z	hwilde	SOURdiesel	maybe can you resize the other partition not swap, then delete the swap, then create a new swap partition that is larger ?
2008-11-18T21:30:00.000Z	SOURdiesel	hwilde	sorry i just noticed i was mispelling your name.  can't resize/move any partition or drive off the live cd.
2008-11-18T21:31:00.000Z	hwilde	SOURdiesel	if you boot from the livecd, you can run gparted, and resize the partitions....
2008-11-18T21:32:00.000Z	SOURdiesel	hwilde	apparently not mine.
2008-11-18T21:33:00.000Z	hwilde	SOURdiesel	try opening a terminal and type gksu gparted
2008-11-18T21:37:00.000Z	SOURdiesel	hwilde	ok
2008-11-18T22:01:00.000Z	SOURdiesel	hwilde	would the fact that the partitions have key icons next to them have anything to do with not being able to do anything to them even with live cd?
2008-11-18T22:01:00.000Z	hwilde	SOURdiesel	lol is there an "unlcok" button on your screen
2008-11-18T22:02:00.000Z	SOURdiesel	hwilde	no
2008-11-18T22:02:00.000Z	hwilde	SOURdiesel	are you sure?  look harder.   you need to hit the unlock button
2008-11-18T22:03:00.000Z	SOURdiesel	hwilde	don't see one.  are talking in live cd i should see an unlock feature?
2008-11-18T22:43:00.000Z	SOURdiesel	hwilde	i must be blind.
2008-11-18T22:44:00.000Z	SOURdiesel	hwilde	i tried again with live cd.  and it gives me the option to resize the main partition.  but sda2 and sda5 nothing.
