2012-04-27T12:57:00.000Z	gaelfx		I'm trying to connect to an NFS share I set up on another computer in my network, but the connection always times out, both comps are running 12.04, can someone help me figure this out?
2012-04-27T12:58:00.000Z	halfie	gaelfx	are NFS ports open or is the firewall inactive?
2012-04-27T12:58:00.000Z	gaelfx	halfie	good thought, I'll check
2012-04-27T12:59:00.000Z	halfie	gaelfx	first try getting your setup running with no firewall (iptables -F)
2012-04-27T13:01:00.000Z	gaelfx	halfie	hm, I don't see any ports being forwarded on my router RE NFS, how can I check if the NFS is actually running on the server?
2012-04-27T13:02:00.000Z	halfie	gaelfx	netstat -nltp should show portmap and some rpc process. though there is a better way which i forgot
2012-04-27T13:02:00.000Z	halfie	gaelfx	got it, run "rpcinfo -p"
2012-04-27T13:02:00.000Z	gaelfx	halfie	osiris I'll try both in a minute
2012-04-27T13:05:00.000Z	gaelfx	halfie	actually, I just noticed transmission's port doesn't seem to be automatically forwarding either, which seems rather strange
2012-04-27T13:10:00.000Z	gaelfx	halfie	ok, I found that NFS shows up in rpcinfo, and it listed the port for it as well, but I was wondering whether or not NFS uses upnp or not?
2012-04-27T13:19:00.000Z	halfie	gaelfx	NFS doesn't use upnp AFAIK
2012-04-27T13:19:00.000Z	gaelfx	halfie	so I have to add the rule to my router myself?
2012-04-27T13:19:00.000Z	halfie	gaelfx	yes, and some NFS ports are random (there is a way to make them static though).
2012-04-27T13:20:00.000Z	halfie	gaelfx	for simple file sharing, sshfs works without all this mess.
2012-04-27T13:21:00.000Z	gaelfx	halfie	I kinda need it to be gui though
2012-04-27T13:22:00.000Z	halfie	gaelfx	sshfs mount points can be opened in GUI explorers, is that what you are talking about?
2012-04-27T13:22:00.000Z	gaelfx	halfie	I suppose, more or less
2012-04-27T13:23:00.000Z	gaelfx	halfie	does sshfs require login using the machines UID and pass though?
2012-04-27T13:24:00.000Z	halfie	gaelfx	ssh requires running sshd on the server and on client it involves giving credentials to mount a folder.
