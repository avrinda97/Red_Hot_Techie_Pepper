2006-04-18T09:39:00.000Z	ubun2		Is there a way to disable DMA of an installation via a livecd?
2006-04-18T09:40:00.000Z	mwe	ubun2	you can't install from the live cd
2006-04-18T09:40:00.000Z	mwe	ubun2	sure
2006-04-18T09:41:00.000Z	mwe	ubun2	edit /etc/hdparm.conf on the drive
2006-04-18T09:41:00.000Z	mwe	ubun2	or disable it complete with the boot option dma=off IIRC
2006-04-18T09:42:00.000Z	mwe	ubun2	is it because you can't boot with dma?
2006-04-18T09:42:00.000Z	ubun2	mwe	read http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=144889. That's basically me problem.
2006-04-18T09:42:00.000Z	mwe	ubun2	you could edit /boot/grub/menu.lst and add dma=off
2006-04-18T09:43:00.000Z	mwe	ubun2	let me check that
2006-04-18T09:44:00.000Z	mwe	ubun2	I don't know if disabling dma would help, but to do it edit /boot/grub/menu.lst and add dma=off to the kernel line
2006-04-18T09:44:00.000Z	mwe	ubun2	it will decrease performance considerably though
2006-04-18T09:46:00.000Z	mwe	ubun2	I don't know. it sure looks bad
2006-04-18T09:50:00.000Z	ubun2	mwe	Can I do that edit from grub or must I use a livecd?
2006-04-18T09:50:00.000Z	mwe	ubun2	you can edit from the menu. highlight the entry and press e
2006-04-18T09:51:00.000Z	mwe	ubun2	the highlight the kernel line and press e again
2006-04-18T09:51:00.000Z	mwe	ubun2	then b to boot it
2006-04-18T09:51:00.000Z	mwe	ubun2	it's only temporarely changed though
2006-04-19T11:54:00.000Z	mwe	ubun2	see /msg from ubotu
2006-04-19T14:34:00.000Z	mwe	ubun2	because it wasn't coded maybe
