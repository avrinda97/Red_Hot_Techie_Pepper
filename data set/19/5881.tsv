2008-05-12T19:56:00.000Z	tim`-		while in windows installing, working and installation is one thing
2008-05-12T19:56:00.000Z	tim`-		its different in ubuntu - either you work OR u install
2008-05-12T19:56:00.000Z	tim`-		sure i'm not logged in as root
2008-05-12T19:57:00.000Z	tim`-		therefore for 'real work' i need windows
2008-05-12T19:57:00.000Z	tim`-		where i can easily safe and install what i want were i want
2008-05-12T19:57:00.000Z	tim`-		sure i can Vlet
2008-05-12T19:57:00.000Z	tim`-		but installing a program without using linux very long
2008-05-12T19:57:00.000Z	tim`-		is sometimes difficult
2008-05-12T19:58:00.000Z	tim`-		doubleclicking on a .exe seems more easy :D
2008-05-12T19:58:00.000Z	Fritzel	tim`-	yeah you lost me on that comment too
2008-05-12T19:58:00.000Z	Fritzel	tim`-	well you could always download the deb  and double click it if it makes you feel better
2008-05-12T19:59:00.000Z	Fritzel	tim`-	I've always thought that to be a waste of time though since its done automatically with the package maanger
2008-05-12T19:59:00.000Z	Fritzel	tim`-	by linux you mean a console?
2008-05-12T20:01:00.000Z	Fritzel	tim`-	Xchat is good
2008-05-12T20:03:00.000Z	Fritzel	tim`-	it's actually quite a bit better than windows update as it handles everything
2008-05-12T20:04:00.000Z	Fritzel	tim`-	I forget what that is
2008-05-12T20:05:00.000Z	Fritzel	tim`-	ahh that's where I have seen it
2008-05-12T20:06:00.000Z	Fritzel	tim`-	I knew I recognized it but I couldn't recall if it was a component of opengl or what
