2009-12-25T02:56:00.000Z	nucc1	phillip	ha, what version of ubuntu are you using?
2009-12-25T02:57:00.000Z	nucc1	phillip	you know what video card you got? you shouldn't be messing with xorg.conf for dualhead
2009-12-25T02:57:00.000Z	nucc1	phillip	not with the modern ubuntus :)
2009-12-25T02:58:00.000Z	nucc1	phillip	prefix your messages with my nick. just type the first few letters, then press tab. what video card have you got?

2009-12-25T03:01:00.000Z	nucc1	phillip	you should delete your xorg.conf, and re-run dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2009-12-25T03:01:00.000Z	nucc1	phillip	then login, and use the GUI to configure the dualhead.
2009-12-25T03:02:00.000Z	phillip	nucc1	Done. Restarting X now
2009-12-25T03:06:00.000Z	nucc1	phillip	System > Preferences > Display

2009-12-25T03:06:00.000Z	nucc1	phillip	uncheck the mirror button.
2009-12-25T03:07:00.000Z	phillip	nucc1	Yeah I have my desired setup done
2009-12-25T03:07:00.000Z	phillip	nucc1	I'll apply and relogin
2009-12-25T03:07:00.000Z	nucc1	phillip	you don't need to relogin
