2006-11-13T06:56:00.000Z	usr13		I've sent a Ubuntu CD to my sister who has apparently installed it and doing fine with it, but, was wondering if any media player is installed by default?  And if not, how is the easiest way to tell her how to install mplayer or xine?
2006-11-13T06:57:00.000Z	coz_	usr13	totem gstreamer is deafault but not really great unless al the codecs have been installed and totem gstreamer replaces with totem-xine
2006-11-13T06:58:00.000Z	coz_	usr13	hold on
2006-11-13T06:59:00.000Z	usr13	coz_	I've not tried totem or gstreamer yet, but will check into those as well.
2006-11-13T06:59:00.000Z	coz_	usr13	well I have all the codecs needed and that particular link you gave seems to be stubborn to play
2006-11-13T07:00:00.000Z	usr13	coz_	what player are you using?
2006-11-13T07:00:00.000Z	coz_	usr13	I use mplayer and the mozilla-mplayer plugin for firefox to play online movies etc
2006-11-13T07:01:00.000Z	coz_	usr13	that link opens up mplayer but it won't play, the video may be unavailable
2006-11-13T07:04:00.000Z	coz_	usr13	she is running dapper or edgy?
2006-11-13T07:04:00.000Z	coz_	usr13	yes
2006-11-13T07:04:00.000Z	usr13	coz_	 Let me look
2006-11-13T07:05:00.000Z	coz_	usr13	here is the link for the restricted format read carefully https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats
2006-11-13T07:06:00.000Z	coz_	usr13	also make sure you have enabled all of the repositories
2006-11-13T07:07:00.000Z	usr13	coz_	what is the easiest way to tell her how to enable all repositories
2006-11-13T07:08:00.000Z	coz_	usr13	well .. the easiest way is to go to synaptic , click on system then repsositories and be sure they are al checked
2006-11-13T07:09:00.000Z	coz_	usr13	however the best way is to use the terminal and type this ins   sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
2006-11-13T07:10:00.000Z	coz_	usr13	when the repsitory list comes up, you want to look for the files that star with "deb" and if they have an "#" in front of it, just remove the #  for all of them and then click the red "X" and hit save
2006-11-13T07:10:00.000Z	coz_	usr13	then in the terminal you want to type sudo apt-get update
2006-11-13T07:11:00.000Z	coz_	usr13	let that run its course... then you can sudo apt-get  thename of file youwant to install
