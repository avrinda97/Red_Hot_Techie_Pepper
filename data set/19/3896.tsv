2009-08-30T23:46:00.000Z	mickster04		does anyone know how to diagnose a broken vlc, it wont start, i dunno how to test what it might be
2009-08-30T23:47:00.000Z	boss_mc	mickster04	try opening it from the command line with vlc -vvvv
2009-08-30T23:47:00.000Z	mickster04	boss_mc	what does -vvvv do?
2009-08-30T23:47:00.000Z	boss_mc	mickster04	super super super verbose
2009-08-30T23:47:00.000Z	boss_mc	mickster04	if it gives too much info, drop a few v's
2009-08-30T23:48:00.000Z	mickster04	boss_mc	i dont know what im looking for
2009-08-30T23:48:00.000Z	boss_mc	mickster04	when it crashes there might be an error reported in the output?
2009-08-30T23:49:00.000Z	mickster04	boss_mc	Halitech ,right did that an it all seems fine apart from the last line which is LibVLC fatal error locking mutex in thread 3082135248 at misc/objects.c:395: 22 Error message: Invalid argument at: /usr/lib/libvlccore.so.0(vlc_pthread_fatal+0xb5)[0xb8060235]
2009-08-30T23:50:00.000Z	boss_mc	mickster04	that's the problem, I'd go ask in #videolan, tell them you're seeing that and it's crashing
2009-08-30T23:50:00.000Z	mickster04	boss_mc	where is #videolan
2009-08-30T23:51:00.000Z	boss_mc	mickster04	on freenode
2009-08-30T23:54:00.000Z	boss_mc	mickster04	did they help?
2009-08-30T23:54:00.000Z	mickster04	boss_mc	not yet im waitin tho...
2009-08-30T23:54:00.000Z	boss_mc	mickster04	ok, well good luck
2009-08-30T23:54:00.000Z	mickster04	boss_mc	;)
2009-08-30T23:56:00.000Z	boss_mc	mickster04	you could try vlc --reset-config
2009-08-30T23:56:00.000Z	boss_mc	mickster04	resets any config changes you've made
2009-08-30T23:56:00.000Z	boss_mc	mickster04	might help, might be really annoying, might do nothing....
2009-08-30T23:56:00.000Z	mickster04	boss_mc	no luck
