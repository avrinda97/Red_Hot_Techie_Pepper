2011-08-09T17:49:00.000Z	maptz		 I have an issue with my samba bdc. When I try to obtain the domain sid or join the domain my server answer : Unable to find suitable server for domain 'MYDOMAIN'.    My pdc is wins server in his subnet (192.168.56. ) and my bdc is wins client of my pdc but in another subnet (192.168.46.). How can I solve my resolution name issue? i suppose it's the main issue
2011-08-09T17:50:00.000Z	ChickenHawk	maptz	are you able to successfully get forward and reverse lookups from the bdc?
2011-08-09T17:53:00.000Z	ChickenHawk	maptz	what is the result of forward and reverse DNS lookups from the bdc...does it resolve both ways?
2011-08-09T17:54:00.000Z	maptz	ChickenHawk	I try
2011-08-09T17:57:00.000Z	maptz	ChickenHawk	name query failed
2011-08-09T17:57:00.000Z	ChickenHawk	maptz	DNS is broken then
2011-08-09T17:58:00.000Z	ChickenHawk	maptz	Do you have admin rights on the DNS server?
2011-08-09T17:58:00.000Z	maptz	ChickenHawk	we use Wins to resolve local name
2011-08-09T17:58:00.000Z	ChickenHawk	maptz	Add the BDC to DNS
2011-08-09T18:00:00.000Z	maptz	ChickenHawk	Ok I'll see that
2011-08-09T18:01:00.000Z	ChickenHawk	maptz	by the way, WINS isn't going to be happy talking to your SAMBA server, WINS is for Microsoft products (or Microsoft's version of NetBIOS)
2011-08-09T18:02:00.000Z	ChickenHawk	maptz	are you just referring to your machine running WINS as a DNS server?  i.e., do you actually have a DNS server running?
2011-08-09T18:03:00.000Z	maptz	ChickenHawk	I'm referring to my PDC only, I ask to my sysAdmin and we just have a wins server
2011-08-09T18:04:00.000Z	ChickenHawk	maptz	You'll need your sysadmin to run a true DNS server to get the functionality you want
2011-08-09T18:05:00.000Z	maptz	ChickenHawk	So no machine with DNS server. It should work with wins, when you look at samba-doc they said samba wrk well with wins
2011-08-09T18:06:00.000Z	ChickenHawk	maptz	idc what the doc says, if you're having that much trouble with it, clearly it's an advanced feature for you and the easier route would be (not surprisingly) the standard route -- use a DNS server
2011-08-09T18:10:00.000Z	maptz	ChickenHawk	Ok, thx I'm going to find information to implements my samba domain with dns resoltion until wins
2011-08-09T18:11:00.000Z	ChickenHawk	maptz	there ya go :)
2011-08-09T18:20:00.000Z	maptz	ChickenHawk	lol
