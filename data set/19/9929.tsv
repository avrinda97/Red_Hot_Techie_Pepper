2006-10-05T11:52:00.000Z	SoH|Tony		hello its me again
2006-10-05T11:53:00.000Z	SoH|Tony		whats the best filesystem for a linux root partition and for a swap partition?
2006-10-05T11:53:00.000Z	ladydoor	SoH|Tony	the best for swap is swap :-)
2006-10-05T11:53:00.000Z	SoH|Tony		i dont have only fat32 and ntfs... i got a whole load of filesystems =(
2006-10-05T11:53:00.000Z	ladydoor	SoH|Tony	and there're a lot of good filesystems for / ...fat32 isn't recommended, and ntfs would be deadly. i'd go for ext3.
2006-10-05T11:54:00.000Z	SoH|Tony		"and ntfs would be deadly" whoooo i was going to chose that
2006-10-05T11:54:00.000Z	SoH|Tony		thanks lady and oskude
2006-10-05T11:54:00.000Z	ladydoor	SoH|Tony	no problem :-)
2006-10-05T11:55:00.000Z	SoH|Tony		swap filesystem is linux-swap right? gon chose that for my 800mb swap partition
2006-10-05T11:55:00.000Z	SoH|Tony		kk great
2006-10-05T11:57:00.000Z	SoH|Tony		what does "mount" mean?
2006-10-05T11:58:00.000Z	SoH|Tony	ubuntu	is asking me if i want to mount my already-in-use 90gb partition to /media/sda5 and my windows partition to /media/sda1
2006-10-05T11:58:00.000Z	SoH|Tony		ok ill let him mount them then
2006-10-05T11:58:00.000Z	ladydoor	SoH|Tony	well, in linux, there's only a single filesystem, with a root at / (pronounced ``slash'' or ``root'')...when you put a partition into a dir in that filesystem so you can access it, you've mounted it.
2006-10-05T11:58:00.000Z	SoH|Tony		im overwhelmed... so much help for a small user =)
2006-10-05T11:59:00.000Z	SoH|Tony		ok so this doesnt mean loss of data for those partitions? hope not =)
2006-10-05T12:00:00.000Z	SoH|Tony		that is really bad!
2006-10-05T12:00:00.000Z	SoH|Tony		because my 90gb partition is NTFS and i really need that data =\
2006-10-05T12:00:00.000Z	ladydoor	SoH|Tony	tell windows to release their source! then linux could read/write them easily.
