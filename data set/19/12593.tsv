2006-05-17T15:25:00.000Z	sparkling		how i can add to my desktop a new hard drive icon?
2006-05-17T15:26:00.000Z	paradizelost	sparkling	the easy way is to mount the hard drive to a folder in /media
2006-05-17T15:26:00.000Z	sparkling	paradizelost	i've mounted it..and i've set in fstab the automount at boot
2006-05-17T15:26:00.000Z	paradizelost	sparkling	but did you mount it in /media/?
2006-05-17T15:27:00.000Z	paradizelost	sparkling	when it mounts, it should autmatically make the icon
2006-05-17T15:27:00.000Z	paradizelost	sparkling	what filesystem?
2006-05-17T15:28:00.000Z	paradizelost	sparkling	you need to make sure you added the user,umask=000 option to the fstab line

2006-05-17T15:32:00.000Z	paradizelost	sparkling	look at the mount location.
2006-05-17T15:33:00.000Z	paradizelost	sparkling	yes, change /mnt/sata100 to /media/sata100
2006-05-17T15:39:00.000Z	paradizelost	sparkling	that work for ay?
2006-05-17T15:40:00.000Z	paradizelost	sparkling	shouldn't need to reboot for taht
2006-05-17T15:43:00.000Z	sparkling	paradizelost	ok all done thanks too much :D
2006-05-17T15:46:00.000Z	sparkling	paradizelost	if i copy files from a ntfs partition he set folder as read only..is it possible to automatic convert all files i copy in read/write after copying?
2006-05-17T15:47:00.000Z	sparkling	paradizelost	ok but i need to open terminal and use chmod command...is it possible to automatize that all times i copy something?
2006-05-17T15:48:00.000Z	paradizelost	sparkling	i never copy in GUI.
2006-05-17T15:50:00.000Z	paradizelost	sparkling	that's what the -Rf of the chmod command is for
2006-05-17T15:58:00.000Z	paradizelost	sparkling	nite
