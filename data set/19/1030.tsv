2011-10-06T14:47:00.000Z	imadper	jrib	there is another thing. My hotkey doesn't work, such as ALT + F2
2011-10-06T14:49:00.000Z	imadper	jrib	it works again。。
2011-10-06T14:49:00.000Z	jrib	imadper	ok

2011-10-06T14:51:00.000Z	imadper	jrib	I can't open other gtk program such as pidgin if i use sudo
2011-10-06T14:51:00.000Z	imadper	jrib	but it works well without sudo
2011-10-06T14:51:00.000Z	jrib	imadper	you shouldn't be using sudo for those programs
2011-10-06T14:52:00.000Z	imadper	jrib	yes, i know. I just want to know if is sudo's fault
2011-10-06T14:53:00.000Z	jrib	imadper	you should be using gksudo when you /need/ to open a graphical program with root privileges
2011-10-06T14:54:00.000Z	imadper	jrib	but, i used sudo to open the software more than half a year 。。。
2011-10-06T14:54:00.000Z	jrib	imadper	gksudo plays more nicely with graphical applications, I don't know details
2011-10-06T14:55:00.000Z	imadper	jrib	OK, thank you very very very much~  :D
2011-10-06T15:05:00.000Z	imadper	jrib	Hi, I try to use "export DISDPLAY=localhost:0.0"  and then it works well
