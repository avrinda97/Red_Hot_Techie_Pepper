2007-03-09T07:21:00.000Z	Joshooa		Can I get some opinions from any of you on why you use Ubuntu, and not Kubuntu?
2007-03-09T07:21:00.000Z	Pelo	Joshooa	 it's a question of preference,  I like the look and feel of gnome,  and I don'T realy care for the look and feels of kde
2007-03-09T07:22:00.000Z	Joshooa	Pelo	Hmm, cause I installed Ubuntu off a DVD, heard lots that Kubuntu was better, did that, lots of stuff from Gnome didn't work, and now I just crashed Kubuntu and can't get back in
2007-03-09T07:23:00.000Z	Pelo	Joshooa	congrats , you crashed a linux distro, almost impossible
2007-06-01T08:02:00.000Z	Pelo	Joshooa	that is the first thing I heard of beryl on windows,  try asking in #beryl they might know (but expect a chuckle at the very least)
2007-06-01T08:03:00.000Z	Joshooa	Pelo	I don't know where I read it, but I SWEAR I saw somethings somewhere, I don't care too much I don't use Windows but they do.
2007-06-01T08:03:00.000Z	Pelo	Joshooa	get them to switch
2007-06-01T08:04:00.000Z	Joshooa	Pelo	My Roommates? They would except they play Doom 3 and Microsoft Flight Simulator, so if I can't get those to run well in Ubuntu they wont do it.
2007-06-01T08:05:00.000Z	Pelo	Joshooa	tell them they are lame and that all the cool kids are using ubuntu now
2007-06-01T08:05:00.000Z	Pelo	Joshooa	 tell them the first one is free,  and so is the second and the third ...
2007-06-01T08:05:00.000Z	Joshooa	Pelo	At work, everywhere I go, Windows sucks, Microsoft sucks, switch to Ubuntu, although Microsoft's Surface is cool.
2007-12-16T07:36:00.000Z	Pelo	Joshooa	 that's an RC level thing but I can't tell you how to do it
2007-12-16T07:36:00.000Z	Joshooa	Pelo	RC?
2007-12-16T07:37:00.000Z	Pelo	Joshooa	/etc/RC.d or rc.2 and such, those ar folder in which you put links to apps that you need started as services
2007-12-16T07:38:00.000Z	Joshooa	Pelo	No ideas on why network manager wont just connect to my network? if it's on roaming I think it sees it, but I have to click on my network name or it wont connect, it just tries and fails otherwise.
2007-12-16T07:38:00.000Z	Pelo	Joshooa	not rea;l;y my area , sorry
2007-12-16T07:38:00.000Z	Joshooa	Pelo	 Alright thanks anyway, maybe I'll look into RC
2008-04-27T07:05:00.000Z	Pelo	Joshooa	run the cd integrety check on the ubuntu cd, from the boot menu
2008-04-27T07:13:00.000Z	Joshooa	Pelo	Ok
