2005-05-03T08:29:00.000Z	tritium	jubei1024	you'll have to build your own nvidia module now, since you're not able to use the one in linux-resricted-modules
2005-05-03T08:30:00.000Z	jubei1024	tritium	with mandrake I just d/l the drivers from nvidia.com and the installer built a module automatically. Can I do that in ubunut?
2005-05-03T08:30:00.000Z	tritium	jubei1024	that's not the best approach, no
2005-05-03T08:31:00.000Z	jubei1024	tritium	ok so are there any guides then? Or can you help? =)
2005-05-03T08:31:00.000Z	tritium	jubei1024	there are guides, but they're for the general case (most users don't need custom kernels)
2005-05-03T08:32:00.000Z	jubei1024	tritium	ok, what are the downfalls of using the nvidia installer?
2005-05-03T08:32:00.000Z	tritium	jubei1024	this is the main guide: http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/BinaryDriverHowto
2005-05-03T08:32:00.000Z	tritium	jubei1024	it won't be a .deb package, and hence not under package management
2005-05-03T08:33:00.000Z	jubei1024	tritium	not a huge prob then is it?
2005-05-03T08:33:00.000Z	tritium	jubei1024	well, if you run into trouble with it, it'll be unsupported, since it's not in ubuntu main or restricted
2005-05-03T08:33:00.000Z	jubei1024	tritium	that guide doesnt say anything about compiling the modules yourself does it?
2005-05-03T08:34:00.000Z	tritium	jubei1024	precisely, because few people need to
2005-05-03T08:34:00.000Z	tritium	jubei1024	not even many ubuntu developers have the need to compile their own kernel.  Why did you need to?
2005-05-03T08:35:00.000Z	jubei1024	tritium	i want to use this 500hz usb polling patch
2005-05-03T08:36:00.000Z	tritium	jubei1024	you're best off installing nvidia-kernel-source, and reading the documentation that comes with it to build a module for your custom kernel
2005-05-03T08:37:00.000Z	jubei1024	tritium	I just used the nvidia installer =) seems ok
2005-05-03T08:39:00.000Z	tritium	jubei1024	used the nvidia installer because he built a custom kernel
2005-05-03T08:41:00.000Z	tritium	jubei1024	don't put words in my mouth
2005-05-03T08:42:00.000Z	tritium	jubei1024	no problem :)
