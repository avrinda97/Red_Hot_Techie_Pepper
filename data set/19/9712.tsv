2007-03-10T07:27:00.000Z	kbrooks		I'd like to setup a FTP server. Is there a simple and easy way to do so?
2007-03-10T07:28:00.000Z	PirateHead	kbrooks	if you want to run a server, you'll have to do some configuring,.
2007-04-20T16:54:00.000Z	kbrooks	PirateHead	no.
2007-04-20T16:54:00.000Z	PirateHead	kbrooks	if I use rm, it will delete the file, won't it?
2007-04-20T16:55:00.000Z	kbrooks	PirateHead	a symlink is a file.
2007-04-20T16:55:00.000Z	kbrooks	PirateHead	with the actual file path in it
2007-04-20T16:56:00.000Z	kbrooks	PirateHead	there are symlink rules in GNU/Linux
2007-04-20T16:58:00.000Z	kbrooks	PirateHead	just open up a shell, and go to the directory where the symbolic link is
2007-04-20T16:58:00.000Z	PirateHead	kbrooks	I renamed the destination file, then double clicked on the symlink in nautilus, and it said "This link is broken. Want to move it to the trash?" and i said, "Yeah!"
2007-04-20T16:59:00.000Z	PirateHead	kbrooks	It's an unintuitive way to get the job done, unfortunately.
2007-04-20T16:59:00.000Z	kbrooks	PirateHead	yes, it is broken now
2007-04-20T16:59:00.000Z	kbrooks	PirateHead	symlinks are (or work just like, if you want) like windows shortcuts
2007-04-20T05:00:00.000Z	kbrooks	PirateHead	hang on please ...
2007-04-20T05:01:00.000Z	PirateHead	kbrooks	but Nautilus doesn't treat them the same way that Windows Explorer does. It treats them, for all intents and purposes, like the original. For example, if I have a link to an executable in Windows, deleting it says "Deleting the shortcut will not uninstall the program", etc. Here, deleting the shortcut just tries to move the destination file to the trash, and in my case caused an...
2007-04-20T05:02:00.000Z	kbrooks	PirateHead	well, that's unintutive, and "non-unixy" so to speak
2007-04-20T05:03:00.000Z	kbrooks	PirateHead	gnome is not windows. just to be clear: gnome is more "simpler" than windows
2007-04-20T05:04:00.000Z	kbrooks	PirateHead	i suggest you reinstall feisty on another computer
2007-04-20T05:04:00.000Z	PirateHead	kbrooks	that's a crappy suggestion. This is my only computer.
2007-04-20T05:04:00.000Z	PirateHead	kbrooks	Edgy sound worked just fine.
