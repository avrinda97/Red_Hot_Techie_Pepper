2007-06-15T08:25:00.000Z	tritium	CyberMad	evolution is very buggy when used as an exchange client, though
2007-06-15T08:34:00.000Z	tritium	CyberMad	depends on what you need.
2007-06-15T08:35:00.000Z	tritium	CyberMad	if you're connecting to an exchange server, evolution has exchange support (albeit buggy), while thunderbird does not
2008-01-23T09:09:00.000Z	tritium	CyberMad	free
2008-01-23T09:11:00.000Z	tritium	CyberMad	luckily that's a short paste.  In general, please don't paste here.
2008-01-23T09:13:00.000Z	tritium	CyberMad	yes, see the links above
2008-01-23T09:16:00.000Z	tritium	CyberMad	likely you're using all that memory, but swapping out less.
2008-01-23T09:17:00.000Z	tritium	CyberMad	memtest86+, as "apt-cache search memtest" would reveal
2008-01-23T09:26:00.000Z	tritium	CyberMad	that's not unusual.
2008-01-23T09:26:00.000Z	tritium	CyberMad	I think everything is normal.  You don't have a problem.
2008-01-23T09:27:00.000Z	CyberMad	tritium	i ask the problem few minutes ago because i got weird problem... my free memory is only 8084
2008-01-23T09:28:00.000Z	tritium	CyberMad	so?
2008-01-23T09:28:00.000Z	tritium	CyberMad	if you only have 512 MB, I'm sure most of it is being utilized.  You're probably also swapping heavily as well.
2008-01-23T09:29:00.000Z	CyberMad	tritium	that's really weird... something eat my memory drop to 8084 from 512MB, i just run File Browser, XChat, Psi and Terminal
2008-01-23T09:29:00.000Z	tritium	CyberMad	see my comments above
2008-01-23T09:30:00.000Z	CyberMad	tritium	if you my pastebin above... my swap isn't use... just only memory eat by something (monster maybe... eh??)
2008-01-23T09:30:00.000Z	tritium	CyberMad	you're not listening...
2008-01-23T09:32:00.000Z	tritium	CyberMad	in particular, read that gentoo wiki page.  It'll explain about the disk cache, etc.
