2005-11-17T06:24:00.000Z	marlun		how can I unpack a tar file to a special directory? I don't get the man page for tar.
2005-11-17T06:25:00.000Z	oofnik	marlun	are you trying to extract the files in a different directory than the one you're working in or what?
2005-11-17T06:26:00.000Z	marlun	oofnik	well, yeah kinda, I'm in a dir with a tar file in it, now I want to extract them to a directory I'm not in.
2005-11-17T06:26:00.000Z	oofnik	marlun	it should just be tar -options [file]  [dir] 
2005-11-17T06:27:00.000Z	marlun	oofnik	hmmm I believe I tried that, but I'll do it again. thanks
2005-11-17T06:37:00.000Z	marlun	oofnik	Ok I'm still having problems, I've managed to gunzip it so now it's only a .tar file, but now to extract it to another dir, what options should I use? If I use tar -x file directory, everything freezes and I have to click CTRL+c to get back.
2005-11-17T06:38:00.000Z	oofnik	marlun	try tar -xvf
2005-11-17T06:42:00.000Z	marlun	oofnik	I get this: tar: ./test: Not found in archive
2005-11-17T06:43:00.000Z	marlun	oofnik	I'm trying to extract it to a directory "test" which is inside the same directory as the tar file.
2005-11-17T06:43:00.000Z	oofnik	marlun	you think you can just use file-roller for this?
2005-11-17T06:44:00.000Z	marlun	oofnik	proberbly, but I want to learn how to use tar :)
2005-11-17T06:47:00.000Z	marlun	oofnik	If I do "tar xfv file.tar" everything works great, however it extract into the same directory and not a directory of my choosing.
2005-11-17T06:48:00.000Z	oofnik	marlun	from what i understand now tar just extracts into wherever you are, you can't tell it to extract somewhere.. so you have to cd into your working directory first, then point tar to the file from there and extract it
2005-11-17T06:50:00.000Z	marlun	oofnik	ah ok, thanks I'll try that
2005-11-17T06:57:00.000Z	marlun	oofnik	Well I tried to go into the directory where I wanted it to be extracted to, and then do tar xfv /path/to/tarfile but that didn't work, seems that I have to extract it in the same directory as the tar file and then use mv to move the directory/files to the place where I want them.
2005-11-17T06:58:00.000Z	marlun	oofnik	hehe yeah =)
2005-11-17T06:59:00.000Z	oofnik	marlun	i know.. you want to know how to do it the command line way because you feel lazy using the gui tool right :P
2005-11-17T07:05:00.000Z	marlun	oofnik	something like that ;P well no, not lazy but it's bugging me that it doesn't work to extract it to any directory.
2005-11-17T07:06:00.000Z	marlun	oofnik	going to bed now, thanks for the help! (even though I didn't get it to work :P)
