2007-04-18T07:17:00.000Z	slyfox		what is the command to check disk for errors ?
2007-04-18T07:19:00.000Z	slyfox		Can someone tell me if this is bad?
2007-04-18T07:19:00.000Z	slyfox		The number of cylinders for this disk is set to 38912.
2007-04-18T07:19:00.000Z	slyfox		There is nothing wrong with that, but this is larger than 1024,
2007-04-18T07:20:00.000Z	slyfox		That is an ext3 clean disk
2007-04-18T07:20:00.000Z	nilleso	slyfox	no that;s normal
2007-04-18T07:20:00.000Z	slyfox	nilleso	ok, so I am ready to use the drive then? I formatted a new hard drive to ext3, want to use it now.
2007-04-18T07:21:00.000Z	nilleso	slyfox	yep you've created partitions then?
2007-04-18T07:21:00.000Z	slyfox	nilleso	is there any way I can rename how the drive is labeled? it automatically mounts (it is an external ahrd drive via usb) as /media/disk-1  I want it to be called instead of disk-1 to be MediaDrive  how can I do it ?
2007-04-18T07:22:00.000Z	slyfox	nilleso	yes, the whole drive is as one partition ext3 formatted.
2007-04-18T07:22:00.000Z	nilleso	slyfox	yes there is a way... checking

2007-04-18T07:33:00.000Z	nilleso	slyfox	cheers !
2007-04-18T07:34:00.000Z	slyfox	nilleso	 one more question, say I gave the drive name label "MediaDrive" once unmounted, how do I mount it back on? sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /media/MediaDrive ?   what if I will mount it to /media/disk-2 for example how will disk-2 mount point conflict with the label MediaDrive ?
2007-04-18T07:36:00.000Z	nilleso	slyfox	you do that in /etc/fstab
2007-04-18T07:36:00.000Z	slyfox	nilleso	"do that" that being what exactly ?
2007-04-18T07:37:00.000Z	nilleso	slyfox	then you can just 'mount /media/MediaDrive"
2007-04-18T07:38:00.000Z	nilleso	slyfox	enter a line for the drive and set it not to boot automatically .. google it, lots of info avail
