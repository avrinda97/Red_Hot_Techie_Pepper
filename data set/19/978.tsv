2011-06-29T05:29:00.000Z	minimee		is there any way to get the proprietary nvidia geforce go 7300 drivers to work?
2011-06-29T05:31:00.000Z	minimee		deww
2011-06-29T05:32:00.000Z	minimee		i have 11.04
2011-06-29T05:32:00.000Z	minimee		yes i do
2011-06-29T05:32:00.000Z	minimee		that's what i mena
2011-06-29T05:32:00.000Z	minimee		mean
2011-06-29T05:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	minimee	you will need t clean reinstall
2011-06-29T05:34:00.000Z	minimee	ActionParsnip	is that the only way to get it to work with the geforcego7300?
2011-06-29T05:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	minimee	if you install nvidia-current it will work
2011-06-29T05:36:00.000Z	minimee	ActionParsnip	that does not work.
2011-06-29T05:37:00.000Z	minimee		the driver doesnt work. it goes back to generic
2011-06-29T05:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	minimee	can you expand on that. Simply saying "It doesn't work" helps nobody, most of all you
2011-06-29T05:38:00.000Z	minimee	ActionParsnip	i DID expand on it
2011-06-29T05:38:00.000Z	minimee		it wont function defaults back to the generic driver
2011-06-29T05:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	minimee	keeping stuff on one line makes things clearer
2011-06-29T05:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	minimee	use nvidia-xconfig to generate an xorg.conf file, it should make the driver load
2011-06-29T05:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	minimee	if not then you can run:  less /var/log/Xorg.0.log    and read the x server log to see what's going on
2011-06-29T05:39:00.000Z	minimee	ActionParsnip	is there a site that describes how to do it?
2011-06-29T05:39:00.000Z	minimee	ActionParsnip	take a look at my forum post. one second...
