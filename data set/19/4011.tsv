2009-04-17T16:09:00.000Z	edoreld		Doesn't someone know how to make a shell script with an infinite loop run in the system boot without it stopping the system boot!?
2009-04-17T16:11:00.000Z	cwillu	edoreld	back up, what are you wanting to do in broad terms?
2009-04-17T16:12:00.000Z	edoreld	cwillu	I'm tring to execute a plugin called nsca_check that communicates with a server and passes info to it
2009-04-17T16:12:00.000Z	cwillu	edoreld	for what purpose?
2009-04-17T16:12:00.000Z	cwillu	edoreld	give the high-level picture
2009-04-17T16:12:00.000Z	edoreld	cwillu	the information is used by a monitoring program to check the status of a service (http, ftp, etc)
2009-04-17T16:13:00.000Z	cwillu	edoreld	look into nagios or a similar package, sounds like that's the sort of monitoring you're trying to do
2009-04-17T16:13:00.000Z	edoreld	cwillu	yes i have nagios installed
2009-04-17T16:13:00.000Z	cwillu		at the very least, look into how they hook into the system
2009-04-17T16:13:00.000Z	edoreld	cwillu	and im using it
2009-04-17T16:13:00.000Z	edoreld	cwillu	the problem is I need to do some checks from the client machine every X minutes
2009-04-17T16:14:00.000Z	edoreld	cwillu	so i need kind of a daemon or something similar
2009-04-17T16:14:00.000Z	cwillu	edoreld	I believe nagios has provisions to do exactly that, but the simplest approach would be to use cron like Titan8990 said
2009-04-17T16:14:00.000Z	cwillu		you can make a cron job to run something periodically
2009-04-17T16:14:00.000Z	edoreld	cwillu	can i make cron start my script at system startup?
2009-04-17T16:14:00.000Z	cwillu	edoreld	read up on cron
2009-04-17T16:15:00.000Z	edoreld	cwillu	^_^
2009-04-17T16:15:00.000Z	cwillu		seriously
2009-04-17T16:15:00.000Z	edoreld	cwillu	im on it ^_^ thanks Titan8990 and cwillu  ^_^
