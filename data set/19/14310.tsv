2004-09-27T15:14:00.000Z	xxorroxx		the problem is obvious , kdebase wont install
2004-09-27T15:14:00.000Z	xxorroxx		However the following packages replace it:
2004-09-27T15:14:00.000Z	xxorroxx		  gnome-icon-theme
2004-09-27T15:14:00.000Z	xxorroxx		E: Package kdebase has no installation candidate
2004-09-27T15:14:00.000Z	xxorroxx		you know what the problem is , I just specified it
2004-09-27T15:14:00.000Z	xxorroxx		dont talk to me like im stupid and being vague
2004-09-27T15:15:00.000Z	xxorroxx		I said .. gnome-icon-themes conflicts with kdebase .. and you said they had a common file , which is the problem
2004-09-27T15:15:00.000Z	xxorroxx		Sirus: sudo passwd root , su root 
2004-09-27T15:16:00.000Z	xxorroxx		can you add regular debian unstable sources to apt ?

2004-09-27T15:20:00.000Z	schweeb	xxorroxx	when you edit your sources.list, you need to apt-get update afterwards
2004-09-27T15:20:00.000Z	xxorroxx	schweeb	I did ...
2004-09-27T15:20:00.000Z	xxorroxx	schweeb	I dunno how it didnt work .. but I tried again and it did .
2004-09-27T15:22:00.000Z	schweeb	xxorroxx	you obviously have never used sid
2004-09-27T15:23:00.000Z	xxorroxx	schweeb	sid == unstable ?
2004-09-27T15:23:00.000Z	schweeb	xxorroxx	well, that's why they call it stable
2004-09-27T15:24:00.000Z	schweeb	xxorroxx	as has been mentioned to you, KDE and friends are in "universe" are unsupported, and my not work
2004-09-27T15:24:00.000Z	schweeb	xxorroxx	not to mention it's a preview release
