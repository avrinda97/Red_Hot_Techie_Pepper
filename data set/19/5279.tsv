2009-11-14T09:46:00.000Z	lokpest	lstarnes	ok, is there anything on the web about this? so EOL for kubuntu hardy will be the same as for ubuntu hardy?

2009-11-14T09:46:00.000Z	lstarnes	lokpest	the only difference between ubuntu and kubuntu is the default applications
2009-11-14T09:47:00.000Z	lokpest	lstarnes	but no official word of this?
2009-11-14T09:47:00.000Z	lstarnes	lokpest	everything else is exactly the same
2009-11-14T09:47:00.000Z	lstarnes	lokpest	kubuntu is an official derivitave of ubuntu
2009-11-14T09:47:00.000Z	lokpest	lstarnes	I know that!
2009-11-14T09:48:00.000Z	lstarnes	lokpest	you can even turn kubuntu into regular ubuntu by installing ubuntu-desktop
2009-11-14T09:48:00.000Z	lokpest	lstarnes	I know! retard
2009-11-14T09:49:00.000Z	lstarnes	lokpest	I'm sorry, but please refrain from using words like that
2009-11-14T09:49:00.000Z	lokpest	lstarnes	why do you treat me like a noob then?
2009-11-14T09:50:00.000Z	lokpest	lstarnes	that is basic questions, I ask about a specific situation
2009-11-14T09:50:00.000Z	lstarnes	lokpest	I was just making sure that you understood what I was saying. I am very sorry if you were offended and I won't do it again
2009-11-14T09:52:00.000Z	lokpest	lstarnes	https://wiki.kubuntu.org/HardyHeron/RC/Kubuntu says that Kubuntu Hardy will not be LTS, and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kubuntu says EOL for Kubuntu Hardy is 2009-10 but my repositories are working fine
2009-11-14T09:57:00.000Z	lstarnes	lokpest	I'm trying to find an answer regarding your question about kubuntu 8.04 being an LTS
2009-11-14T09:58:00.000Z	lstarnes	lokpest	from what I have seen so far, kubuntu isn't an LTS, but the repositories (possubly excluding kubuntu-specific packages) will still be treated as LTS repositories
