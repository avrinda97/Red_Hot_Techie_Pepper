2010-03-01T03:29:00.000Z	surf		Hi is it possible to recompile the kernel without the udevd daemon?
2010-03-01T03:30:00.000Z	ikonia	surf	why would you want to do that , udev is critical to the system
2010-03-01T03:30:00.000Z	surf	ikonia	ok because I have a problem with that. Each time I download smt I get 100% cpu
2010-03-01T03:30:00.000Z	ikonia	surf	udev goest to %100 when you download something ?
2010-03-01T03:31:00.000Z	surf	ikonia	yeah. Each time I use the internet connection to transfer files
2010-03-01T03:31:00.000Z	ikonia	surf	what version of ubuntu ?
2010-03-01T03:31:00.000Z	surf	ikonia	9.10
2010-03-01T03:31:00.000Z	ikonia	surf	have you seen if there is a bug logged on launchpad for that ?
2010-03-01T03:32:00.000Z	ikonia	surf	I've never heard of that
2010-03-01T03:32:00.000Z	surf	ikonia	yeah I looked for that on launchpad but there are always different bugs from mine
2010-03-01T03:32:00.000Z	ikonia	surf	is there nothing even similar ?
2010-03-01T03:33:00.000Z	surf	ikonia	no they usually say it's related to the optical drive...
2010-03-01T03:33:00.000Z	ikonia	surf	have you tried unplugging the optical drive ?
2010-03-01T03:34:00.000Z	surf	ikonia	I'm on a laptop
2010-03-01T03:34:00.000Z	ikonia	surf	ok - so the bug can still be valid then
2010-03-01T03:34:00.000Z	surf	ikonia	it can be
2010-03-01T03:43:00.000Z	surf	ikonia	so what shall I do? I can't use this system in these conditions...
2010-03-01T03:43:00.000Z	ikonia	surf	could always kill udev and update the bug report
2010-03-01T03:45:00.000Z	surf	ikonia	when I kill the process it just restarts!
