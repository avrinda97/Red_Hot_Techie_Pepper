2008-02-15T14:17:00.000Z	Agent_bob		blag yes
2008-02-15T14:18:00.000Z	Agent_bob		blag VAR="something \n something else"
2008-02-15T14:18:00.000Z	blag	Agent_bob	how do i go about including a newline in a string variable?
2008-02-15T14:18:00.000Z	blag	Agent_bob	sry, lag...
2008-02-15T14:20:00.000Z	blag	Agent_bob	that dint work...  the \n printed out \n literally, and writing the variable on different lines just added a space, any other ideas?
2008-02-15T14:22:00.000Z	blag	Agent_bob	neil_d: the first part is simply a test, everything after "exit 0" is the part in the script: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/56043/
2008-02-15T14:24:00.000Z	blag	Agent_bob	what type of quotes should I be using?
2008-02-15T14:24:00.000Z	blag	Agent_bob	great!  many thanks!
2008-02-15T14:25:00.000Z	blag	Agent_bob	okay, will do
2008-02-15T14:28:00.000Z	blag	Agent_bob	Sry, its late here, is the thing that's surprising the use of single quotes?
2008-02-15T14:31:00.000Z	blag	Agent_bob	ah, that is weird.  any idea why they did it that way?
2008-02-15T14:31:00.000Z	blag	Agent_bob	I guess I'm too used to the PHP way of thinking about quotes.  But thanks for pointing that out, I'll have to delve deeper into quotes.
2008-02-15T14:34:00.000Z	blag	Agent_bob	since you seem to be far more knowledgeable than I: I got my script to work with short flags ("-h") with getopts, how do I get it to work with long options ("--help")?
2008-02-15T14:36:00.000Z	blag	Agent_bob	I updated it, here's the link: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/56044/
2008-02-15T14:37:00.000Z	blag	Agent_bob	np
2008-02-15T14:40:00.000Z	blag	Agent_bob	Error: Unknown option -
2008-02-15T14:43:00.000Z	blag	Agent_bob	and just for clarification, you meant I should add a space between "--" and ")", right?
2008-02-15T14:47:00.000Z	blag	Agent_bob	there is this: http://nlp.cs.jhu.edu/~edrabek/utils/
2008-02-15T14:51:00.000Z	blag	Agent_bob	That's okay.  THanks for all your help!
