2005-02-16T11:04:00.000Z	LinkMasterSab		Blah, when I upgraded to Gaim 1.1.2, it stopped connecting to MSN
2005-02-16T11:05:00.000Z	LinkMasterSab		I asked on #gaim and they couldn't help me either
2005-02-16T11:06:00.000Z	Dreamer3	LinkMasterSab	sounds like a gaim problem
2005-02-16T11:06:00.000Z	Dreamer3	LinkMasterSab	go back to the older version
2005-02-16T11:06:00.000Z	Dreamer3	LinkMasterSab	/var/cache/apt i'd say... locating and install an old versoin
2005-02-16T11:08:00.000Z	LinkMasterSab	Dreamer3	Where are the packages that the installation CD installs?
2005-02-16T11:08:00.000Z	Dreamer3	LinkMasterSab	i don't know
2005-02-16T11:08:00.000Z	Dreamer3	LinkMasterSab	search for .deb files
2005-02-16T11:38:00.000Z	LinkMasterSab	Dreamer3	Windows is a damned good thing to emulate in a quite a few places
2005-02-16T11:38:00.000Z	Dreamer3	LinkMasterSab	sure, but don't say you're windows until you are :)
2005-02-16T11:39:00.000Z	Dreamer3	LinkMasterSab	things won't just work until vendors properly support linux
2005-02-16T11:39:00.000Z	Dreamer3	LinkMasterSab	until them (some) linux users live in a second rate world
2005-02-16T11:40:00.000Z	LinkMasterSab	Dreamer3	Yeah. There's a reason I'm considering moving back to Windows already.
2005-02-16T11:48:00.000Z	LinkMasterSab	Dreamer3	I've been running Ubuntu for a week now.
2005-02-16T11:49:00.000Z	LinkMasterSab	Dreamer3	That's generally because manufacturers provide drivers to Windows and not Linux.
2005-02-16T11:49:00.000Z	Dreamer3	LinkMasterSab	i know :)
2005-02-16T11:50:00.000Z	Dreamer3	LinkMasterSab	it's because linux is the minority
2005-02-16T11:54:00.000Z	Dreamer3	LinkMasterSab	i agree
2005-02-16T11:54:00.000Z	Dreamer3	LinkMasterSab	not that it's ubuntu's fault or anything
