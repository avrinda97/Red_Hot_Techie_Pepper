2007-08-13T09:26:00.000Z	kyncani	Sunnyboi14	from windows or from ubuntu's livecd
2007-08-13T09:28:00.000Z	kyncani	Sunnyboi14	either format your drive from windows, or from ubuntu livecd, or from ubuntu on another computer
2007-08-13T09:58:00.000Z	kyncani	Sunnyboi14	boot ubuntu's livecd, there may be a tool in a system menu somewhere that can partition your hard drive the way you want
2007-08-13T10:01:00.000Z	kyncani	Sunnyboi14	forget about fdisk
2007-08-13T10:02:00.000Z	kyncani	Sunnyboi14	if you have ubuntu on your other pc, you can install gparted and partition your external hard drive with it
2007-08-13T10:02:00.000Z	kyncani	Sunnyboi14	from the Add/Remove package manager
2007-08-13T10:05:00.000Z	kyncani	Sunnyboi14	it should be called partition something and be located in a system menu somewhere
2007-08-13T10:10:00.000Z	kyncani	Sunnyboi14	resize the ubuntu partition, then move it, then resize your windows partition
2007-08-13T10:15:00.000Z	kyncani	Sunnyboi14	well, if ext3 cannot be resized, you'll have to delete all the ubuntu partitions then resize your windows partition to take up the entire disk space
