2005-07-15T09:13:00.000Z	gm78		Does anyone know what is a really good FTP server that is easy to set up for Ubuntu?
2005-07-15T09:13:00.000Z	Lathiat	gm78	proftpd
2005-07-15T09:14:00.000Z	gm78	Lathiat	i checked that one in synaptic, doesnt look like it is in main, i would prefer something supported with security updates
2005-07-15T09:14:00.000Z	Lathiat	gm78	Thats not very nice, arabics are not all terrorists
2005-07-15T09:14:00.000Z	gm78	Lathiat	ummmm, think u got the wrong guy there
2005-07-15T09:15:00.000Z	Lathiat	gm78	yeh, vsftpd works, and thats in main
2005-07-15T09:15:00.000Z	Lathiat	gm78	erghh
2005-07-15T09:15:00.000Z	Lathiat	gm78	my appologies
2005-07-15T09:15:00.000Z	gm78	Lathiat	lol, thats alright
2005-07-15T09:16:00.000Z	gm78	Lathiat	would u say proftpd is easier to set up? i can always compile the latest version of their are security holes in the one in universe?
2005-07-15T09:16:00.000Z	Lathiat	gm78	well, it just works (tm)
2005-07-15T09:17:00.000Z	Lathiat	gm78	but, if you want main (which is a good idea)
2005-07-15T09:17:00.000Z	Lathiat	gm78	vsftpd would be the way to go
2005-07-15T09:17:00.000Z	Lathiat	gm78	no experience in setting that up however
2005-07-15T09:18:00.000Z	gm78	Lathiat	alright, hopefully there are some good docs out there for vsftpd....im not very good at setting server stuff up
2005-07-15T09:18:00.000Z	Lathiat	gm78	in theory, for just ftping as a user, it should work out of th ebox
2005-07-15T09:19:00.000Z	gm78	Lathiat	dabaR, alright. will do. also, this ftp server is going to only be run occasionally from a desktop (mainly if i need to transfer a very large file to someone), most daemons seem to set themselves up to load at system boot, will making the script in /etc/init.d/ non executable make it not load at boot?
2005-07-15T09:20:00.000Z	Lathiat	gm78	using SSH with SCP/SFTP woudl probably be better in that situation
2005-07-15T09:28:00.000Z	gm78	Lathiat	kbrooks, dabaR, anyways, thanks for your guys' help with the ftp questions :)
