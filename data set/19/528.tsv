2012-01-13T22:21:00.000Z	Pici	glioross	it needs to be spelled correctly: multiverse
2012-01-13T22:23:00.000Z	Pici	glioross	:q!
2012-01-13T22:23:00.000Z	glioross	Pici	same
2012-01-13T22:24:00.000Z	Pici	glioross	you need to run apt-get update first.
2012-01-13T22:25:00.000Z	Pici	glioross	No, you should keep it there.
2012-01-13T22:26:00.000Z	Pici	glioross	Can you rephrase the last part of that sentence? I don't understand what you're asking.
2012-01-13T22:27:00.000Z	glioross	Pici	: metatropeas.com is a script converts youtube videos to mp3. I installed ffmpeg and mp3lame and the site is still not working
2012-01-13T22:29:00.000Z	Pici	glioross	What does that have to do with installing ffmpeg and lame on your server?
2012-01-13T22:30:00.000Z	glioross	Pici	the script requires the installation of ffmpeg and lame
2012-01-13T22:30:00.000Z	Pici	glioross	You're running the script that powers that site on your site?
2012-01-13T22:31:00.000Z	glioross	Pici	that script is installed on my server. and i am trying to use my server to convert the videos
2012-01-13T22:32:00.000Z	Pici	glioross	Where is this script?
2012-01-13T22:34:00.000Z	Pici	glioross	Thats just a website.  How you are you trying to get this to work on your server?
2012-01-13T22:35:00.000Z	glioross	Pici	using define('FFMPEGPath', 'ffmpeg'); //OR "/usr/bin/ffmpeg"
2012-01-13T22:36:00.000Z	Pici	glioross	Did you write this tool yourself?
2012-01-13T22:36:00.000Z	glioross	Pici	: no
2012-01-13T22:37:00.000Z	Pici	glioross	Then where did you get the tool? metatropeas.com has no information on it, just a textbox, two buttons and non-technical information.
2012-01-13T22:37:00.000Z	glioross	Pici	i bought that script from a developer. And the developer is not responding to emails
2012-01-13T22:38:00.000Z	Pici	glioross	I think that the developer is your best source for help here. Its really out-of-scope for this channel.
