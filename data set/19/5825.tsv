2008-05-06T04:56:00.000Z	jedimind		would you guys recommend something other than WINE for better performance? more specifically for photoshop; i find that the redraw rates are sluggish at best w/ WINE
2008-05-06T04:56:00.000Z	jedimind		transmission thats it
2008-05-06T04:57:00.000Z	jedimind		is htere anything you guys would recommend over WINE for seemless windows integration
2008-05-06T04:59:00.000Z	jedimind		yeah im looking for a local solution on my laptop; just essentially have to be able to run photoshop as transparently as possible and w/ decent response
2008-05-06T04:59:00.000Z	jedimind		is there a virtualbox version compatible w/ hardy ?
2008-05-06T04:59:00.000Z	h00k	jedimind	check out Virtualbox
2008-05-06T05:00:00.000Z	jedimind		im looking at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VirtualBox there's no mention of hardy support
2008-05-06T05:00:00.000Z	h00k	jedimind	yes, there is.  There's the Sun version that's closed source, and the open source one in synaptics
2008-05-06T05:00:00.000Z	jedimind		fair enough
2008-05-06T05:00:00.000Z	h00k	jedimind	in hardy: 'sudo apt-get install virtualbox-ose'
2008-05-06T05:01:00.000Z	h00k	jedimind	also grab the kernel modules for your kernel
2008-05-06T05:01:00.000Z	h00k	jedimind	and finally add your username to vboxusers
2008-05-06T05:01:00.000Z	jedimind		that might be a little out of my league (kernel modules)
2008-05-06T05:01:00.000Z	h00k	jedimind	I can help you if you'd like
2008-05-06T05:02:00.000Z	jedimind	h00k	mind if i msg you real quick ?
2008-05-06T05:02:00.000Z	h00k		no prob
2008-05-06T05:02:00.000Z	h00k	jedimind	no prob
2008-05-06T05:02:00.000Z	h00k	jedimind	you might have to register on the server to privmsg
2008-05-06T05:03:00.000Z	h00k	jedimind	join chan #h00k
