2010-12-30T01:51:00.000Z	airman00		right now I'm sending UDP packets, and I see in wireshark that 29 bytes are being used for Ethernet layer ( says its between my router and my server). If I remove my router and just connect my server directly to the modem, will that remove the ethernet layer ( aka I'll save 29 bytes)
2010-12-30T01:52:00.000Z	baggar11	airman00	not if you're still using ethernet ;)
2010-12-30T01:52:00.000Z	airman00		isn't ethernet only between the router and the other computers? Is there anyway to remove the ethernet layer but still connect to the internet?
2010-12-30T01:54:00.000Z	baggar11	airman00	not if you're connection is using ethernet. ethernet is a form of layer 2
2010-12-30T01:55:00.000Z	airman00	baggar11	but a direct connection to the modem ( no router or hub ) even that uses the ethernet layer?
2010-12-30T01:55:00.000Z	baggar11	airman00	other options include frame relay, token ring, etc.
2010-12-30T01:55:00.000Z	baggar11	airman00	of which you aren't using
2010-12-30T01:56:00.000Z	baggar11	airman00	besides the actual physical cable, there is no other layer below ethernet
2010-12-30T01:56:00.000Z	baggar11	airman00	you can google OSI Model to find out more, basics of networking...
2010-12-30T01:57:00.000Z	airman00	baggar11	thanks! I'm reading into it now. Its strange, when i reduce my data from 9 bytes to 3 bytes, the ethernet bytes increases!
2010-12-30T01:57:00.000Z	baggar11	airman00	your mtu?
2010-12-30T02:00:00.000Z	airman00	baggar11	I'm unsure. Is that something I would have set in the code for the socket server? Or a router property?
2010-12-30T02:01:00.000Z	baggar11	airman00	for total frame size
2010-12-30T02:01:00.000Z	airman00		oh total frame is 60 bytes
2010-12-30T02:01:00.000Z	airman00		according to wireshark
2010-12-30T02:03:00.000Z	airman00	baggar11	but im unsure how to find out my mtu
2010-12-30T02:04:00.000Z	baggar11	airman00	ifconfig
2010-12-30T02:04:00.000Z	baggar11	airman00	listed as MTU:1500 or something similar
2010-12-30T02:05:00.000Z	airman00	baggar11	yea its 1500. Why?
