2005-12-23T12:58:00.000Z	munzir		hi sirs, I see that for breezy there is apache2 and apache2-common, what's the difference please?
2005-12-23T12:59:00.000Z	Pygi	munzir	just install apache2, and it'll install common with it
2005-12-23T13:00:00.000Z	munzir	Pygi	but what I did is that I installed apache2-common and now apache seems to work without apache2!!
2005-12-23T13:01:00.000Z	Pygi	munzir	apache2-common is essential part, but it won't work all ;)
2005-12-23T13:01:00.000Z	munzir	Pygi	can  you give an example of what won't work?
2005-12-23T13:02:00.000Z	Pygi	munzir	not really, but I higly advise you to install apache2 as well ;)
2005-12-23T13:03:00.000Z	munzir	Pygi	ok then I will install apache to make sure apahce would work. funny ;)
2005-12-23T13:03:00.000Z	Pygi	munzir	hehe ;)
2005-12-23T13:14:00.000Z	Pygi	munzir	try to use /media/ not /mnt
2005-12-23T13:15:00.000Z	munzir	Pygi	ok I will try but why?
2005-12-23T13:15:00.000Z	munzir	Pygi	mnt is still on the LSB standard, no?
2005-12-23T13:15:00.000Z	Pygi	munzir	that won't solve your problem, and mnt is not standard I think *anymore*
2005-12-23T13:17:00.000Z	munzir	Pygi	still same problem after using media
2005-12-23T13:17:00.000Z	Pygi	munzir	I know, I told you that won't solve your problem ;)
2005-12-23T13:18:00.000Z	munzir	Pygi	;)
2005-12-23T13:18:00.000Z	munzir	Pygi	thanks for guessing correctly ;)
2005-12-23T13:18:00.000Z	Pygi	munzir	what seems to be your problem exactly? ;)
2005-12-23T13:19:00.000Z	munzir	Pygi	nothing beside I was about to trash a very valuable partition because of a false report by fdisk -l !!
2005-12-23T13:19:00.000Z	Pygi	munzir	HEH !!!
