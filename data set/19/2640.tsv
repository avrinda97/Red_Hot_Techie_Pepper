2010-08-08T13:54:00.000Z	paranoidphreak		hi everybody, i'm new to linux and this question may sound dumb but i have installed a package called "MultiGet" and i have specified a place where to save the downloads but it only shows up in that folder once the download is complete. is there anyway to access the file while it's being downloaded? if so, how?
2010-08-08T13:56:00.000Z	KE1HA	paranoidphreak	Depends on how your downloading it. Do you need Download status or actual access to the file itself?
2010-08-08T13:56:00.000Z	paranoidphreak	KE1HA	actual access to the file
2010-08-08T13:57:00.000Z	KE1HA	paranoidphreak	I think that will be locked until the DL is complete.
2010-08-08T14:00:00.000Z	paranoidphreak	KE1HA	oh, is there any other download manager out there that allows me access to the downloading file?
2010-08-08T14:03:00.000Z	KE1HA	paranoidphreak	It also depends on the file type, if it's a Binary file (compiled) its a non-starter, but as asci file, you could use Tail -f or something in a terminal to show new data. You risk file corruption on a file that's being DL'ed. I dont know of a DL manager that will do that off hand.
2010-08-08T14:05:00.000Z	paranoidphreak	KE1HA	i'm interested in dloading ISO files
2010-08-08T14:07:00.000Z	paranoidphreak	KE1HA	thanks anyways for your help......i'll keep looking in the synaptic to find a package that's suitable to me
2010-08-08T14:08:00.000Z	KE1HA	paranoidphreak	Oh, ok, I certainly don't know of an app for ISO viewing during download. I use Zsync to keep all the ISO I want up to date.
2010-08-08T14:10:00.000Z	KE1HA	paranoidphreak	check out ubuntu-qa-tools there's a script in it called d-ubuntu-test-iso. can be useful for other ISO's as well. Just ahve to do a few mods / tweeks to it.
2010-08-08T14:11:00.000Z	KE1HA		dl-ubuntu-test-iso*
2010-08-08T14:11:00.000Z	paranoidphreak	KE1HA	my filesystem partition is very small and i'm worried the incompleted file is being downloaded on that before it's moved to the location i had specified to save the files
2010-08-08T14:13:00.000Z	KE1HA	paranoidphreak	if you specified the final location, and there's plenty of space there, you should have any trouble.
2010-08-08T14:14:00.000Z	KE1HA		oops you should "not" have .. ..
2010-08-08T14:14:00.000Z	KE1HA	paranoidphreak	what app are you using to download with ?
2010-08-08T14:15:00.000Z	paranoidphreak	KE1HA	im currently using "MultiGet" and it only shows the file in that folder once it's completed
2010-08-08T14:18:00.000Z	KE1HA	paranoidphreak	if its the partition space you worked about, not th file itself initially, use the system resource monitor or DF to watch the disk space closely. I use Zsync or rsync because it dramatically cuts down on DL time.
2010-08-08T14:18:00.000Z	KE1HA		.. worried*
2010-08-08T14:19:00.000Z	paranoidphreak	KE1HA	got it, thanks
