2008-04-19T05:26:00.000Z	Pelo	eaglestar	there are drivers that are not available for amd64 yet and some packages like flash are not available either,  unless you have a need for 64bit OS you are better off running the i386 for now
2008-04-19T05:32:00.000Z	Pelo	eaglestar	yes,  but you will need to do it from the live cd , you can'T resize a live partiton
2008-04-19T05:36:00.000Z	Pelo	eaglestar	you can do with 1 gig or less even
2008-04-19T21:39:00.000Z	Pelo	eaglestar	you are stating your case backward
2008-04-19T21:43:00.000Z	Pelo	eaglestar	did you take the time to read the INSTALL file in the tar.gz package ?
2008-04-19T21:48:00.000Z	Pelo	eaglestar	try looking in the forum  www.ubuntuforums.org
2008-04-19T21:53:00.000Z	Pelo	eaglestar	 it helps if ou use the name of the person you are talking to in each line
2008-04-19T21:53:00.000Z	Pelo	eaglestar	extract to your desktop and read the file in it
2009-09-30T05:44:00.000Z	Pelo	eaglestar	guest documents are not saved
2009-09-30T05:45:00.000Z	Pelo	eaglestar	it's gone
