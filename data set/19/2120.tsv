2010-06-25T16:46:00.000Z	Ulmo		Hi. Has anyone here been able to get alltray working for Lucid lynx?
2010-06-25T16:46:00.000Z	Ulmo		I click on a window and nothing happens. Using Gnome.
2010-06-25T16:47:00.000Z	VCoolio	Ulmo	what version is it? still 0.69? then try the much improved 0.7.4 from launchpad.net, also check what output it gives in a terminal
2010-06-25T16:48:00.000Z	Ulmo	VCoolio	Yea, 0.69
2010-06-25T16:49:00.000Z	VCoolio	Ulmo	then add the repo from launchpad, install that one (mind that apt thinks 0.69 is higher than 0.7.4 so be careful with updates)
2010-06-25T16:49:00.000Z	Ulmo	VCoolio	It says 0.71a is the latest stable release.
2010-06-25T16:51:00.000Z	VCoolio	Ulmo	try that if you don't fancy the dev version then; whatever works is ok
2010-06-25T16:58:00.000Z	VCoolio	Ulmo	try this https://launchpad.net/~alltray-developers/+archive/ppa
2010-06-25T16:58:00.000Z	Ulmo	VCoolio	Thanks
2010-06-25T16:59:00.000Z	VCoolio	Ulmo	you know how adding ppa etc works?
2010-06-25T17:00:00.000Z	VCoolio	Ulmo	nvm, you can click 'Read about installing' there, very instructive
2010-06-25T17:00:00.000Z	Ulmo	VCoolio	I read that, ran the command, sorted.
2010-06-26T02:15:00.000Z	VCoolio	Ulmo	reinstall windows, you will loose grub, so reinstall grub and done
2010-06-26T02:16:00.000Z	VCoolio	Ulmo	can't windows do that? for ntfs better use windows; or use an ubuntu live cd and use gparted from there
2010-06-26T02:16:00.000Z	Ulmo	VCoolio	You can use Gparted from the Ubuntu cd??
2010-06-26T02:17:00.000Z	VCoolio	Ulmo	I thought so, at least parted; you may need to 'install' gparted, you can install stuff with a livecd session as long as it doesn't require a reboot (like video drivers)
2010-06-26T02:18:00.000Z	Ulmo	VCoolio	I have gparted installed but it only shows a 320gb partition, despite ubuntu being installed alongside windows.
2010-06-26T02:21:00.000Z	VCoolio	Ulmo	I'm not the man for this to debug; you don't overlook some 'scan' button?
2010-06-26T02:22:00.000Z	Ulmo	VCoolio	That's ok. No there is no scan button, just one partition in /dev/sda/  298.09gb.
