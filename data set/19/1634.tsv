2011-06-21T01:04:00.000Z	sw0rdfish		hey guys how do I install python-software-properties in 11.04?
2011-06-21T01:05:00.000Z	trism	sw0rdfish	sudo apt-get install python-software-properties; is there some error?
2011-06-21T01:06:00.000Z	trism	sw0rdfish	pastebin: apt-cache policy python python-software-properties;
2011-06-21T01:10:00.000Z	sw0rdfish	trism	https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/natty/+package/python-software-properties
2011-06-21T01:10:00.000Z	sw0rdfish	trism	can you guide me through it, I just download that and do dpkg on it?
2011-06-21T01:11:00.000Z	trism	sw0rdfish	the reason I wanted policy was not for the version, but for the repos from which the packages come from
2011-06-21T01:14:00.000Z	sw0rdfish	trism	http://pastebin.com/pderTtx0
2011-06-21T01:16:00.000Z	trism	sw0rdfish	I see, you are on lucid, but are just using the python version from natty, that is probably not the greatest idea
2011-06-21T01:17:00.000Z	sw0rdfish	trism	I believe I'm on Natty Narwal
2011-06-21T01:18:00.000Z	trism	sw0rdfish	pastebin /etc/apt/sources.list, because policy has lucid repos
2011-06-21T01:23:00.000Z	sw0rdfish	trism	but yeah I can tell its all using Lucid!
2011-06-21T01:25:00.000Z	trism	sw0rdfish	not sure why the system indicates natty, that isn't a stock sources.list though, anyway, easiest fix is probably to revert to the lucid python: sudo apt-get install python=2.6.5-0ubuntu1; then python-software-properties should install
2011-06-21T01:25:00.000Z	trism	sw0rdfish	unless of course there are deeper problems
2011-06-21T01:27:00.000Z	trism	sw0rdfish	yes
2011-06-21T01:27:00.000Z	trism	sw0rdfish	you're welcome
2011-06-21T01:31:00.000Z	trism	sw0rdfish	were there any issues installing the older python version? did it try to change any other packages?
2011-06-21T01:54:00.000Z	trism	sw0rdfish	did you get everything working with python-software-properties? after rethinking it, I agree with wols_, even though you have the lucid repos, the command I gave is probably a very bad idea without further investigation
2011-06-21T01:57:00.000Z	trism	sw0rdfish	probably the safest bet, although you should probably ask whoever set up the VPS why you have natty packages but lucid repos
2011-06-21T02:00:00.000Z	sw0rdfish	trism	do you think I should wait till he responds to me lol
