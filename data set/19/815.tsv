2011-09-18T08:26:00.000Z	SIFTU	terr	snapshots & replication of the deltas
2011-09-18T08:31:00.000Z	SIFTU	terr	most places do it at the SAN/NAS level.. you take a snapshot (online) of the filesystem the difference is transferred from the last snapshot.
2011-09-18T08:31:00.000Z	terr	SIFTU	in this case they already have copies of the data before its loaded into the HDD's... it just takes so long to read the data in.
2011-09-18T08:32:00.000Z	terr	SIFTU	like on a 3490 they might have a pallet of tapes.
2011-09-18T08:33:00.000Z	SIFTU	terr	yeah but a backup which takes months to restore isnt a good backup IMHO
2011-09-18T08:34:00.000Z	terr	SIFTU	their "backup" is what they read the data from.
2011-09-18T08:35:00.000Z	SIFTU	terr	so how long does it take to restore if the disk system goes down?
2011-09-18T08:36:00.000Z	terr	SIFTU	I don't know.  It doesn't happen very often and they just reload it as if it ahd never been loaded b4
2011-09-18T08:37:00.000Z	terr	SIFTU	I suspec tthey have more than 120,000 tapes loaded.  We have warehouses with 60,000 tapes.
2011-09-18T08:37:00.000Z	terr	SIFTU	I can ask but they likely won't even know.
2011-09-18T08:37:00.000Z	SIFTU	terr	ok, just sounded like it took a long time.. which means they cant use that data until its restored.. which sounds like it could takes months
2011-09-18T08:38:00.000Z	terr	SIFTU	well these are mnultiple jobs.
2011-09-18T08:38:00.000Z	terr	SIFTU	I know when the 9GB's first came out and were $5,000 each I use to sell all I could lay my hot hands on.
2011-09-18T08:40:00.000Z	terr	SIFTU	if there is a way to copy the data from a modren disk to some other storage media then we're real insterested./.. but I don't think there is anything at this time.
2011-09-18T08:40:00.000Z	terr	SIFTU	you would have to know how to read seg-d to do it
2011-09-18T08:41:00.000Z	SIFTU	terr	its getting off topic.. PM me if you wish to discuss
2011-09-18T08:41:00.000Z	terr	SIFTU	some of that data is in IBM360 FLOAT notation and you would have to swap it to IEEE.  Some of it is in Digital Equipment FLOAT too.
2011-09-18T08:42:00.000Z	terr	SIFTU	lets get on to things which are productive.
