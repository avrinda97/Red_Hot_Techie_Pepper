2006-10-05T05:29:00.000Z	martijn		Hey, I just installed the package gnochm (chm viewer) from synaptic, and when I run it I get this error: "You do not have all of the required Python modules to run gnochm. ... could not import gtk"
2006-10-05T05:29:00.000Z	martijn		I have python-gtk2 installed though
2006-10-05T05:30:00.000Z	martijn		What can I do?
2006-10-05T05:30:00.000Z	oskude	martijn	findout what version of pythong gtk it wants
2006-10-05T05:33:00.000Z	martijn	oskude	In the readme it says pygtk2 is needed
2006-10-05T05:34:00.000Z	oskude	martijn	hmm... you better surf the makers site for help...
2006-10-05T05:36:00.000Z	martijn	oskude	I'm thinking this is a bug in the gnochm packaging
2006-10-05T05:39:00.000Z	oskude	martijn	where did you got it ? i cant find it with apt-cache...
2006-10-05T05:40:00.000Z	martijn	oskude	I got it from universe
2006-10-05T05:41:00.000Z	oskude	martijn	whats the package name ?
2006-10-05T05:41:00.000Z	oskude	martijn	got a link to chm i can test ?
2006-10-05T05:42:00.000Z	martijn	oskude	it also gives that error simply starting it from the terminal
2006-10-05T05:42:00.000Z	oskude	martijn	hmm, not here... seems to work...
2006-10-05T05:43:00.000Z	oskude	martijn	as i said, gnochm works here... are you using "pure" dapper ?
2006-10-05T05:49:00.000Z	martijn	oskude	on a suggestion from somebody on #gnome, I ran 'python -c "import gtk"'. I get this result: http://pastebin.ca/191803.
2006-10-05T05:50:00.000Z	oskude	martijn	"undefined symbol: cairo_surface_write_to_png_stream" hmm, maybe youre missing some python/cairo png librarys...
2006-10-05T06:02:00.000Z	martijn	oskude	thanks for your help. I can't figure this out though. I've tried reinstalling python2.4-cairo, but that doesn't fix it.
2006-10-05T06:03:00.000Z	oskude	martijn	good boy ;)
2006-10-05T06:06:00.000Z	oskude	martijn	dunno, it works here with out errors.. but if you have good error/debug logs, a bugreport wouldnt hurt
