2011-02-15T08:26:00.000Z	ElderDryas	yeik	Bingo! Congrats. No one here over the past few days realised he was running off the .iso (it took us a day to realize he was running off a usb at all)
2011-02-15T08:27:00.000Z	yeik	ElderDryas	thanks, i wish i could get my iso to run that well off of a usb (my iso was about 1 gb containing 3 differen't os installers)

2011-02-15T08:34:00.000Z	yeik	ElderDryas	nice. ok. I work in computer support, so i am good at knowing what people are doing with very little data, and being able to easily explain to them how to go about fixing it.
