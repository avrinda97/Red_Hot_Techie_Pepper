2007-04-28T09:24:00.000Z	whaq		Greetings, y'all
2007-04-28T09:24:00.000Z	whaq		Any VMWare users?
2007-04-28T09:26:00.000Z	whaq		I'm wondering, if one were to run XP on VMWare. Would there be any performance difference between a Windows Host vs Ubuntu Host?
2007-04-28T09:26:00.000Z	sanityx	whaq	Shouldn't be much really
2007-04-28T09:26:00.000Z	sanityx	whaq	XP performance in vmware is near native, as far as I can tell.
2007-04-28T09:27:00.000Z	whaq	sanityx	I've experienced Oracle performing 30-60% slower running on Windows, compared to linux. I thought windows just had that much more overhead, which would show similar difference to VMWare.
2007-04-28T09:30:00.000Z	whaq	sanityx	i tried running vmware on Vista. It's DOG slow.
2007-04-28T09:30:00.000Z	sanityx	whaq	its not supported.
2007-04-28T09:31:00.000Z	sanityx	whaq	Download the workstation 6 release candidate. works great on vista.
2007-04-28T09:31:00.000Z	whaq	sanityx	workstation 6.0 beta supports vista.. that's what I'm using.
2007-04-28T09:31:00.000Z	sanityx	whaq	It works great for me.
2007-04-28T09:31:00.000Z	whaq	sanityx	still dog slow.. athlon 4200, 2gb ram.. i don't know what's wrong.
2007-04-28T09:31:00.000Z	whaq	sanityx	ok, must be some config on my end.
2007-04-28T09:32:00.000Z	sanityx	whaq	I donnu man. Cuz I'm using a turion 64 1.6 ghz with 2gb ram in a laptop and it works great
2007-04-28T09:32:00.000Z	whaq	sanityx	so it's about the same perf then.. mine is 2ghz x2
2007-04-28T09:33:00.000Z	whaq	sanityx	i think i'll just try vmware on ubuntu
2007-04-28T09:33:00.000Z	sanityx	whaq	not really. turions are optimized for low power and your cpu has a lot more cache than mine. mine has like 256k cache or something
2007-04-28T09:35:00.000Z	whaq	sanityx	ok, i'm just pretty much being screwed by karma right now then.
2007-04-28T09:35:00.000Z	sanityx	whaq	Yeah. Mark Shuttleworth is  haunting you.
