2009-11-12T00:33:00.000Z	BluesKaj		anyone using openssh to connect remotely thru a router ?
2009-11-12T00:33:00.000Z	Scunizi	BluesKaj	there's probably lots of people.. what's the real question? how to accomplish that?
2009-12-19T01:51:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Scunizi	the latest and safest (I've been informed) is to use 'sudo do-realease-upgrade -d ', for alpha&beta versions , drop the -d for official releases
2009-12-19T01:52:00.000Z	Scunizi	BluesKaj	dist-upgrade isn't designed to upgrade to the next ubuntu release.. you use it from within your current release to "possibly" upgrade packages to the latest version.. however .. you are correct in what you have said for a release upgrade
2009-12-19T01:52:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Scunizi	yeah , but I use aptitude so the syntax is a bit different there too
2009-12-19T01:54:00.000Z	Scunizi	BluesKaj	pretty close.. apt-get was just shorter for me to type :)
2010-07-14T04:58:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Scunizi	pick the printer then your driver options should change
2010-07-14T04:59:00.000Z	Scunizi	BluesKaj	picked "generic" and it gave me the cups-pdf driver.. checking it now.. prints things upside down.. and crops the page..
2010-07-14T05:01:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Scunizi	i said choose your  printer first
2010-07-14T05:02:00.000Z	Scunizi	BluesKaj	cups-pdf is the printer but there is no option for that in the printer list..
2010-07-14T05:02:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Scunizi	the make and model should be in the list
2010-07-14T05:04:00.000Z	Scunizi	BluesKaj	I don't think you're aware of what cups-pdf is.. it creates a printer called cups-pdf that is selectable from a printer dialogue box in any program.
2010-07-14T05:07:00.000Z	Scunizi	BluesKaj	you've totally misunderstood.  I know cups is a backend server.  It's just this goofy kde printer setup forces me to http://localhost:631 where I can actually get done what I need.. thanks for trying though.
2011-03-21T22:19:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Scunizi	in the server text do /whois theperson'snick
2011-03-21T22:19:00.000Z	Scunizi	BluesKaj	got it thanks.. switching to irssi to attempt again.
2011-03-21T22:20:00.000Z	Scunizi	BluesKaj	just to see if quassel "doesn't" support /whois.. which I would think would be a network function anyway.
2011-03-21T22:21:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Scunizi	afaik quassel supports whois
2011-03-21T22:21:00.000Z	Scunizi	BluesKaj	ah.. ok. thanks
2011-09-06T00:14:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Scunizi	404 errors ?
