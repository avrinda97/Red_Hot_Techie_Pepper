2006-08-01T09:20:00.000Z	m1ckeyknox		alright... anybody... I'm trying to connect via tightvnc to vncserver on my ubuntu server box... can't. It worked prior to a restart. Suggestions?
2006-08-01T09:22:00.000Z	m1ckeyknox		4992 pts/0    R+     0:00 grep vncserver
2006-08-01T09:22:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	m1ckeyknox	sure the vncserver started?
2006-08-01T09:23:00.000Z	m1ckeyknox	TheGateKeeper	no
2006-08-01T09:24:00.000Z	m1ckeyknox	TheGateKeeper	how can I start it from the command line? honestly... I did an apt-get and no idea how it works... it's just "magic" ;-)

2006-08-01T09:35:00.000Z	m1ckeyknox	TheGateKeeper	ideally... I don't want xserver running on a regular basis underpowered development box
2006-08-01T10:07:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	m1ckeyknox	not that I have ever done this, but don't you ssh onto your server, start X which then starts the vncserver, you use the vnc client and off you go?
2006-08-01T10:10:00.000Z	m1ckeyknox	TheGateKeeper	this is a first time for me as well...
2006-08-01T10:10:00.000Z	m1ckeyknox	TheGateKeeper	seems that I can't just "startx"
2006-08-01T10:28:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	m1ckeyknox	just found this: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VNCOverSSH
2006-08-01T10:29:00.000Z	m1ckeyknox	TheGateKeeper	you might be my hero.
2006-08-01T10:47:00.000Z	m1ckeyknox	TheGateKeeper	that was an interesting read... but ultimately... not really what I'm looking for...
2006-08-01T10:48:00.000Z	m1ckeyknox	TheGateKeeper	it seems that remote desktop only works if somebody is logged in... but I want it to function that it logs in when somebody connects.
2006-08-01T10:49:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	m1ckeyknox	you want a script to copy logs over so you can look at them?
2006-08-01T10:50:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	m1ckeyknox	it's alright I misunderstood
2006-08-01T10:51:00.000Z	m1ckeyknox	TheGateKeeper	the goal is simply to be able to use the GUI remotely (from another computer)
2006-08-01T10:51:00.000Z	m1ckeyknox	TheGateKeeper	I don't want to have to leave a window manager running...
2006-08-01T10:56:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	m1ckeyknox	when you ssh into your server you can start X and the vnc server correct?
