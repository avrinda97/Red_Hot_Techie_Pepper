2009-08-26T22:11:00.000Z	jonii3		my dad uses ubuntu linux, and I really want to use it, but I have one question. I know my wireless doesn't work out of the box, what are my chances of getting it working.
2009-08-26T22:11:00.000Z	Halitech	jonii3	depends, probably pretty good but you may need a wired connection to get it going
2009-08-26T22:14:00.000Z	Halitech	jonii3	you need the windows driver files, usually the inf and .sys files
2009-08-26T22:14:00.000Z	Halitech	jonii3	what do you mean you have them but don't know where they are?
2009-08-26T22:15:00.000Z	Halitech	jonii3	do you have a cd that came with the wireless card? they are usually on there
2009-08-26T22:16:00.000Z	Halitech	jonii3	ok, you should be able to get the wireless drivers from the laptop site
2009-08-26T22:16:00.000Z	Halitech	jonii3	I would suggest using the windows 2000 drivers if available and not the XP drivers
2009-08-26T22:17:00.000Z	Halitech	jonii3	I can try, I'm not the best at it but will try
2009-08-26T22:17:00.000Z	Halitech	jonii3	not sure on the vista drivers
2009-08-26T22:18:00.000Z	Halitech	jonii3	before you try an install, maybe try the live cd and see if we can get it working there
2009-08-26T22:18:00.000Z	Halitech	jonii3	if not, it will at least give us info about the card
2009-08-26T22:18:00.000Z	Halitech	jonii3	yes
2009-08-26T22:23:00.000Z	jonii3	Halitech	I have a 2 gig usb stick, would that be big enough?
2009-08-26T22:24:00.000Z	Halitech	jonii3	yes
2009-08-26T22:25:00.000Z	Halitech	jonii3	not outdated, just an older version, 9.04 would be a better option now
2009-08-26T22:27:00.000Z	jonii3	Halitech	no forum acccount, might get one though
2009-08-26T22:27:00.000Z	Halitech	jonii3	should, very useful to have
2009-08-26T22:27:00.000Z	Halitech	jonii3	same name there as here for me
