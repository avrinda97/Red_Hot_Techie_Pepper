2008-09-13T16:39:00.000Z	holyguyver_		Hello I have a nasty little problem here
2008-09-13T16:40:00.000Z	holyguyver_		I was running a program in wine & when it crashed it killed my (USB)Mouse & all of my other USB so that they don't even get power, Now what can I do in terminal to get my mouse activated again?
2008-09-13T16:41:00.000Z	holyguyver_		Please even if you don't know how to help, any suggestion would be nice, but don't ask me to pastebin anything as I cannot do that without a mouse.
2008-09-13T16:41:00.000Z	holyguyver_		USB I already told you
2008-09-13T16:41:00.000Z	alkaliv2	holyguyver_	did you restart X at all?
2008-09-13T16:42:00.000Z	alkaliv2	holyguyver_	hit ctrl+alt+backspace
2008-09-13T16:43:00.000Z	holyguyver_	alkaliv2	but I do not want to restart my system as there are things I need to save.
2008-09-13T16:43:00.000Z	alkaliv2	holyguyver_	it's only going to restart the graphical server.  Your mouse, keyboard, and monitor drivers
2008-09-13T16:46:00.000Z	holyguyver_	alkaliv2	but when it restarts those won't it turn off any programs I currently have open?
2008-09-13T16:47:00.000Z	alkaliv2	holyguyver_	yes but the workaround for that is to bring the program you need to save into focus and tab until you can choose the option to save with your keyboard and arrow keys
2008-09-13T16:47:00.000Z	holyguyver_	alkaliv2	 I don't know how to do that.
2008-09-13T16:48:00.000Z	alkaliv2	holyguyver_	alt+tab to bring the program you want into focus
2008-09-13T16:49:00.000Z	alkaliv2	holyguyver_	then press tab until you highlight the file drop down menu and then press enter and use the arrow keys to navigate
2008-09-13T16:51:00.000Z	alkaliv2	holyguyver_	I'd hate to say you're running into a string of bad luck but you're going to want to just save it to your hard drive until you can activate your usb ports again
2008-09-13T16:51:00.000Z	holyguyver_	alkaliv2	I know, I am asking how can I save it to my harddrive?
2008-09-13T16:52:00.000Z	alkaliv2	holyguyver_	when you're in the save menu just tab around by using the enter key and arrows to navigate until you can save to your home folder
2008-09-13T16:53:00.000Z	alkaliv2	holyguyver_	press tab until the tabs are highlighted and then move the arrow keys left or right and press enter
2008-09-13T16:54:00.000Z	holyguyver_	alkaliv2	when I press tab in Pidgin it makes a paraggraph indent
2008-09-13T16:55:00.000Z	alkaliv2	holyguyver_	I'm not sure how to navigate out of the typing area.  give me a second and I'll use my pidgin to try it
