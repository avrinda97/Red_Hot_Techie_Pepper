2009-01-23T10:35:00.000Z	Shakedown		How come the vimtutor doesn't do anything when I run it?
2009-01-23T10:35:00.000Z	_Vi_	Shakedown	just keep pressing j or page down
2009-01-23T10:36:00.000Z	_Vi_	Shakedown	its just a online text file,
2009-01-23T10:37:00.000Z	_Vi_	Shakedown	that is the tutorial lol
2009-01-23T10:38:00.000Z	_Vi_	Shakedown	hang on let me see if i get the same problems.. one sec
2009-01-23T10:40:00.000Z	_Vi_	Shakedown	hmmm what command are you using exactly for that ?
2009-01-23T10:41:00.000Z	_Vi_	Shakedown	vimtutuor is interactive, but all it is a online (not online as web) text file, it kinda looks like a man page, that's it. nothing too fancy
2009-01-23T10:42:00.000Z	Shakedown	_Vi_	So...why is my vimtutor page blank?
2009-01-23T10:43:00.000Z	_Vi_	Shakedown	run 'dpkg -l *vim*' in a terminal, pastebin the results
2009-01-23T10:43:00.000Z	Shakedown	_Vi_	pastebin?
2009-01-23T10:47:00.000Z	Shakedown	_Vi_	http://paste.ubuntu.com/108457/
2009-01-23T10:48:00.000Z	_Vi_	Shakedown	if you type gvim do you get anything?
2009-01-23T10:49:00.000Z	Shakedown	_Vi_	I don't have it, it can be found though.
2009-01-23T10:50:00.000Z	_Vi_	Shakedown	hmmm i'd do 'sudo apt-get install vim*' and see if that fixes it.
2009-01-23T10:51:00.000Z	Shakedown	_Vi_	Wow, a ton of dependencies I
2009-01-23T10:52:00.000Z	Shakedown	_Vi_	Oh well, forget it
2009-01-23T10:54:00.000Z	_Vi_	Shakedown	i thought you already had vim installed, that's why i had you do vim*, but meh, what ever it works now :)
2009-01-23T10:54:00.000Z	Shakedown	_Vi_	Ha I thought I had vim too!
2009-01-23T10:55:00.000Z	Shakedown	_Vi_	I guess I had vim-tiny though
