2010-10-10T21:37:00.000Z	linuxR		hello everyone, I try to create a ubuntu 10.04 live cd with persistent storage using the "startup disk creator", but I cannot boot from it, getting the error " can not mount /dev/loop0 on //filesystem.squashfs"....ISO image is okay, booting from this image also works when not created using "startup disk creator"...can someone help?
2010-10-10T21:38:00.000Z	Ryen	linuxR	What type of disk did you write to?
2010-10-10T21:38:00.000Z	linuxR		ryen, a 4gb usb stick
2010-10-10T21:38:00.000Z	linuxR	Ryen	I mean :)
2010-10-10T21:38:00.000Z	Ryen	linuxR	What computer are you trying to boot with it?
2010-10-10T21:39:00.000Z	linuxR	Ryen	a netbook...I tried with another computer as well, didnt work either
2010-10-10T21:39:00.000Z	linuxR	Ryen	can boot from another 10.04 usb stick though
2010-10-10T21:40:00.000Z	Ryen	linuxR	So the co,puter cant boot from just this one flash drive?
2010-10-10T21:41:00.000Z	Ryen		*computer
2010-10-10T21:41:00.000Z	linuxR	Ryen	I think the problem is that the "startup disk creator" of 10.04 creates invalid media when using the "persitent files" feature
2010-10-10T21:41:00.000Z	linuxR		but I don't know how to fix this
2010-10-10T21:41:00.000Z	Ryen	linuxR	Give me a second, let me see if I can find something.
2010-10-10T21:42:00.000Z	linuxR	Ryen	thanks, I also did some googling, the error is quite unspecific unfortunately :(
2010-10-10T21:43:00.000Z	Ryen	linuxR	So it is only the flash drive that is set to persistent?
2010-10-10T21:44:00.000Z	linuxR	Ryen	I did not yet try to create a non-persistent disk with THIS stick...thats the next thing Im going to try
2010-10-10T21:44:00.000Z	Ryen	linuxR	You might want to try that, since this issue is really unknown.
2010-10-10T21:45:00.000Z	linuxR	Ryen	okay, going to try...thanks for now, I'll give feedback when I know more
2010-10-10T21:45:00.000Z	Ryen	linuxR	Okay. Good luck, I will continue to look for something.
2010-10-10T22:02:00.000Z	linuxR	Ryen	I now created the stick without using the "peristent storage" feature, and indeed it works!
