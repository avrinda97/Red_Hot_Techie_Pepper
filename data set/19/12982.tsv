2005-06-10T06:34:00.000Z	Belial_		PLEASE HELP: Linksys EG1032 v3 gigabit NIC on hoary, see's it as device but doesn't show up in Networking panel (no connection)
2005-06-10T06:35:00.000Z	cafuego	Belial_	Find the required modiule (google) and load it.
2005-06-10T06:35:00.000Z	Belial_	cafuego	did, still nothing
2005-06-10T06:36:00.000Z	cafuego	Belial_	Then it might simply not be supported
2005-06-10T06:37:00.000Z	Belial_	cafuego	it's based on the natsemi 83820 chipset, which means that it needs ns83820, i modprobed it, lsmoded to make sure it loaded, and nothing
2005-06-10T06:37:00.000Z	cafuego	Belial_	it loaded OK? Did it show up in 'dmesg' ?
2005-06-10T06:37:00.000Z	Belial_	cafuego	it shows up in lsmod
2005-06-10T06:38:00.000Z	cafuego	Belial_	That wasn't my question.
2005-06-10T06:38:00.000Z	Belial_	cafuego	i don't know if it shows up in dmesg
2005-06-10T06:38:00.000Z	cafuego	Belial_	Could you check?
2005-06-10T06:39:00.000Z	Belial_	cafuego	lets asume that it loads with no problem, i'm dual booting win/linux and i have to be in windows for NIC to work (now) and to check a single thing would require two reboots
2005-06-10T06:39:00.000Z	cafuego	Belial_	Could you check?
2005-06-10T06:40:00.000Z	Belial_	cafuego	ok
2005-06-10T06:40:00.000Z	cafuego	Belial_	if it loads OK, there will be an 'ethX: natsemi ... ' log message in dmesg.
2005-06-10T06:41:00.000Z	Belial_	cafuego	just "dmesg" in commandline/
2005-06-10T06:41:00.000Z	cafuego	Belial_	yep
2005-06-10T06:41:00.000Z	Belial_	cafuego	ok i'll be back after i check
2005-06-10T06:51:00.000Z	Belial_	cafuego	back
2005-06-10T06:52:00.000Z	Belial_	cafuego	dmesg does not return eth0 etc etc, it returns ns83820.c: NatSemi 10/100/1000 DP83820 etc
