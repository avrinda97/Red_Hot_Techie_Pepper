2009-12-29T08:03:00.000Z	unop	ndroftheline	 find recovery/ -name "*.jpg" -exec mv -t recovery/JPG/ {} +
2009-12-29T08:04:00.000Z	unop	ndroftheline	just be careful, mv will silently overwrite existing files
2009-12-29T08:05:00.000Z	ndroftheline	unop	wow ok
2009-12-29T08:05:00.000Z	ndroftheline	unop	can you explain what that command does exactly?
2009-12-29T08:06:00.000Z	unop	ndroftheline	 find has an -exec option where you can pass filenames to commands ... here we pass filenames ({}) to mv
2009-12-29T08:07:00.000Z	ndroftheline	unop	oh i see...its giving an error message saying that "filex" and "filex" are the same file, x b eing a number
2009-12-29T08:07:00.000Z	ndroftheline	unop	hrm...only other issue is that this appears to have moved all the jpg's from all my ~ subdirecories too. was that an expected behavior?
2009-12-29T08:08:00.000Z	ndroftheline	unop	i just wanted to move the jpgs in the top directory
2009-12-29T08:08:00.000Z	unop	ndroftheline	 that is expected yes.. if you want to only operate on the top directory, you need to add  -maxdepth 1
2009-12-29T08:08:00.000Z	ndroftheline	unop	got it.
2009-12-29T08:09:00.000Z	ndroftheline	unop	ok...now that they're in the same directory, i'd like to sort them based on size...
2009-12-29T08:11:00.000Z	unop	ndroftheline	 du *.jpg | sort -n
2009-12-29T08:12:00.000Z	ndroftheline	unop	ok so i've got something like 38k files
2009-12-29T08:12:00.000Z	ndroftheline	unop	how do i get the number of files?
2009-12-29T08:12:00.000Z	ndroftheline	unop	i'm so sorry these are dumb questions...is there a guide on these basic commands you would recommend?
2009-12-29T08:13:00.000Z	unop	ndroftheline	the folks in #bash have a brilliant FAQ and guide
2009-12-29T08:14:00.000Z	ndroftheline	unop	ok...how do i get to it? i'm on xchat-gnome
2009-12-29T08:14:00.000Z	unop	ndroftheline	/j #bash
2009-12-29T08:15:00.000Z	ndroftheline	unop	thank you so much
