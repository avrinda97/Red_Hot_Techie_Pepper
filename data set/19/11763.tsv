2005-12-23T07:40:00.000Z	shadox		does someone has an easy solution for mp3?
2005-12-23T07:40:00.000Z	shadox		doesn't work
2005-12-23T07:40:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	shadox	libmad0
2005-12-23T07:42:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	shadox	that's because you're spelling it wrong.  It's gstreamer0.8-mad
2005-12-23T07:42:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	shadox	why don't you use synaptic?  It's graphical-- you can browse through the packages and such
2005-12-23T07:49:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	shadox	beep-media-player is like xmms but better and plays mp3s by default I think
2005-12-23T07:50:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	shadox	in fact it's like exactly the same program.  Open up synaptic and search for it, dude
2005-12-23T09:30:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	shadox	really?  When I first discovered debian, apt was my favorite part of it!  I loved it instantly
2005-12-23T09:31:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	shadox	synaptic is just apt with graphics, dude
2005-12-23T09:32:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	shadox	you should.  Right-click it and pin it somewhere you can access quickly-- it's great
2005-12-23T09:43:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	shadox	not planning on having any kids?
2005-12-23T09:44:00.000Z	shadox	tiglionabbit	no thnQ still to young :D
2005-12-23T09:45:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	shadox	which error?
2005-12-23T09:45:00.000Z	shadox	tiglionabbit	bash
2005-12-23T09:46:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	shadox	you mean when it says "bash: command not found: yourcommand" ?
2005-12-23T09:46:00.000Z	shadox	tiglionabbit	yes
2005-12-23T09:46:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	shadox	well, that means bash looked in all the directories in the $PATH variable, and couldn't find a file with the same name as the one you told it to run
2005-12-23T09:47:00.000Z	shadox	tiglionabbit	that would mean, or the name or the directory is wrong?
2005-12-23T09:47:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	shadox	bash is your shell.  When a program wants to give you an error, it tends to say it like so:  "programname: type of error: specific input that caused it"
