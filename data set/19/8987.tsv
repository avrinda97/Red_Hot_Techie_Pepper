2007-08-09T10:16:00.000Z	MasterShrek	orudie	lol what are you trying to install?
2007-08-09T10:17:00.000Z	MasterShrek	orudie	why not install xchat from the repositories/
2007-08-09T10:18:00.000Z	orudie	MasterShrek	because the version i installed from there is a 0.16 so i guess its too old, the one i use in windows is a 2.8.4.0 and they have the same version for fedora linux
2007-08-09T10:19:00.000Z	MasterShrek	orudie	mine from the repositories is 2.8
2007-08-09T10:22:00.000Z	MasterShrek	orudie	there shoudl be just an xchat

2007-08-09T10:23:00.000Z	orudie	MasterShrek	under which category, cause its not there under internet or all, i even typed in xchat in search, and only xchat-gnome comes up
2007-08-09T10:23:00.000Z	MasterShrek	orudie	its in the universe repo
2007-08-09T10:29:00.000Z	MasterShrek	orudie	use synaptic
2007-08-09T10:30:00.000Z	orudie	MasterShrek	synaptic? whats that?
2007-08-09T10:42:00.000Z	MasterShrek	orudie	put the proper resolutions in /etc/X11/xorg.conf and restart X
2007-08-09T10:43:00.000Z	orudie	MasterShrek	how exactly would i do that lol
2007-08-09T10:44:00.000Z	MasterShrek	orudie	   sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf             then scroll to the bottom and put the resoultion you want in there, save and do a ctrl+alt+backspace
2007-08-09T10:47:00.000Z	orudie	MasterShrek	i can only locate the available modes, cant see the part that i have to modify
2007-08-09T10:48:00.000Z	MasterShrek	orudie	if you see where the resolutions are in there, i usually just add the resolution that i want in there for each depth
2007-08-09T10:49:00.000Z	orudie	MasterShrek	1600x1200 is listed there for each depth but not letting me choose it though
2007-08-09T10:50:00.000Z	MasterShrek	orudie	try putting just 1600x1200 in there and get rid of the other resolutions (back up xorg.conf first)
