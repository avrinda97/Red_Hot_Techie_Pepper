2010-06-27T20:34:00.000Z	Over^Kill		Should the CD-ROM show up under Places/Home Folder?
2010-06-27T20:36:00.000Z	Over^Kill		am new to Ubuntu just cant get this NIC card working
2010-06-27T20:36:00.000Z	Over^Kill		I have the drivers on the CD
2010-06-27T20:36:00.000Z	Over^Kill		I think
2010-06-27T20:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Over^Kill	 you could just mount it by hand. or look in /media/cdrom to see if its there
2010-06-27T20:37:00.000Z	Over^Kill	Dr_Willis	Just finished installing Ubuntu the CD-ROM isnt mounted by default?
2010-06-27T20:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Over^Kill	 ive never noticed. if its not mounted.. then mount it.
2010-06-27T20:38:00.000Z	Over^Kill	Dr_Willis	sorry im not sure how to do that :/
2010-06-27T20:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Over^Kill	 sudo mount /media/cdrom
2010-06-27T20:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Over^Kill	 then look in /media/cdrom to see the cd. (if it mounts)
2010-06-27T20:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Over^Kill	 you did use sudo mount /media/cdrom ? with the /media ? not 'media/cdrom' ?
2010-06-27T20:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Over^Kill	 or try mounting it this way 'sudo mkdir /media/cdrom' 'sudo mount /dev/cdrom /media/cdrom'
2010-06-27T20:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Over^Kill	 the 'filesystem type' shoudl be iso9660
2010-06-27T20:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Over^Kill	 or 'udf'   the option would be -t iso9660    or -t udf
2010-06-27T20:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Over^Kill	 thats to be expected. :)
2010-06-27T20:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Over^Kill	 whats the exact command line you are using?
2010-06-27T20:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Over^Kill	 as command line similer to 'sudo mount /dev/sr0 /media/cdrom -t iso9660' should mount the device to the directory /media/cdrom (make that dir with sudo mkdir /media/cdrom first)
2010-06-27T21:03:00.000Z	Over^Kill	Dr_Willis	- ok I got it, tyvm
2010-06-27T21:03:00.000Z	Over^Kill	Dr_Willis	now I just gota figure how to install the files on it to install my NIC card
