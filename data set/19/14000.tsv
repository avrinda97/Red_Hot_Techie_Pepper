2005-01-11T06:25:00.000Z	scoon	nirai	if i would try and open a bunch of tabs my entire sys would lock.
2005-01-11T06:26:00.000Z	scoon	nirai	i thought it was my hardware, wireless card or video card.

2005-01-11T06:29:00.000Z	scoon	nirai	what worked for me was just opening 1 or 2 tabs at a time.  Letting them load and then open up 1 or 2 more.
