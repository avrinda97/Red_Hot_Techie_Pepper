2007-04-13T16:43:00.000Z	foug	hamlet	i don't see a lilo.conf, only a libao
2007-04-13T16:43:00.000Z	hamlet	foug	maybe you are using grub and lilo is not even installed?
2007-04-13T16:43:00.000Z	foug	hamlet	is that a bad thing?
2007-04-13T16:43:00.000Z	hamlet	foug	not at all
2007-04-13T16:44:00.000Z	hamlet	foug	just the tutorial cannot be followed litteraly
2007-04-13T16:44:00.000Z	foug	hamlet	well see, the next lesson says i can change what it says at start up. But it wants me to hav lilo.conf
2007-04-13T16:44:00.000Z	hamlet	foug	yes lilo was state of the art up until a couple of years
2007-04-13T16:45:00.000Z	foug	hamlet	damn outdated tutorials
