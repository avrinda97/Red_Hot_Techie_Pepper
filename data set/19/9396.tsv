2007-07-29T16:55:00.000Z	reverseblade		err dunno, I detest C++ and avoid it at any cost:)
2007-07-29T16:55:00.000Z	buzzbuzz	reverseblade	it works by installing not a thing on feisty, all you have to do is go to System > Administration > Restricted Drivers, then select the nvidia driver which appears there
2007-07-29T16:55:00.000Z	reverseblade	buzzbuzz	what was your problem again ?
2007-07-29T16:56:00.000Z	buzzbuzz	reverseblade	sorry, not mine exactly, but puvneet's problem
2007-07-29T16:56:00.000Z	reverseblade	buzzbuzz	what you said not worked on my computer
2007-07-29T16:56:00.000Z	buzzbuzz	reverseblade	Oh, it did very well for me, I'm using a GeForce 7600 GT
2007-07-29T05:07:00.000Z	buzzbuzz	reverseblade	Is there a way to get Colin McRae: DiRT to work in Wine? Google didn't help me :p
2007-07-29T05:08:00.000Z	reverseblade	buzzbuzz	have you searched app database of wine
2007-07-29T05:08:00.000Z	reverseblade	buzzbuzz	and ?
2007-07-29T05:08:00.000Z	buzzbuzz	reverseblade	didn't find anything so far

2007-07-29T05:10:00.000Z	reverseblade	buzzbuzz	the answer seems no
2007-07-29T05:10:00.000Z	reverseblade	buzzbuzz	firstly I recommend virtualbox over VMWare , althoug VMWare is a perfect solution
2007-07-29T05:11:00.000Z	reverseblade	buzzbuzz	2ndly when you go for Virtual Machines, everything works except ... Hardware accelerations . Meaning forget about DirectX and only software rendering with opengl
2007-07-29T05:12:00.000Z	reverseblade	buzzbuzz	there is one exception to this  and that is VMWare workstation which is not free
2007-07-29T05:12:00.000Z	buzzbuzz	reverseblade	Ah, I see, thanks though!!
