2007-12-12T09:33:00.000Z	craptasticles		Why does wireless suck so bad in ubuntu?
2007-12-12T09:34:00.000Z	craptasticles		I've had nothing but problems from anything to do with wireless. Network Manager sees my network but it just refuses to connect to it. Any ideas?
2007-12-12T09:35:00.000Z	andymushu	craptasticles	could you give me some more info about your setup?
2007-12-12T09:36:00.000Z	craptasticles	andymushu	dell xps 400 desktop, recent upgrade from feisty to gutsy (it worked in feisty), linksys wmp54g and linksys wusb54g
2007-12-12T09:36:00.000Z	andymushu	craptasticles	is your wireless network encrypted?
2007-12-12T09:36:00.000Z	craptasticles	andymushu	unencrypted and broadcasted
2007-12-12T09:37:00.000Z	andymushu	craptasticles	so if you click on the signal bars in the top right on the top toolbar, does it show any networks?
2007-12-12T09:38:00.000Z	craptasticles	andymushu	yes. It shows the network on both cards, ~80% signal
2007-12-12T09:38:00.000Z	andymushu	craptasticles	and if you click on your network, what happens?
2007-12-12T09:39:00.000Z	craptasticles	andymushu	the thing circles around the 2 dots for about 2 minutes and gives the equivalent of limited/no connectivity in windows.
2007-12-12T09:39:00.000Z	craptasticles	andymushu	169.25.x.x
2007-12-12T09:39:00.000Z	andymushu	craptasticles	does one dot turn green or are they both grey?
2007-12-12T09:40:00.000Z	craptasticles	andymushu	both stay gray
2007-12-12T09:40:00.000Z	andymushu	craptasticles	do you have any security settings set for your router? such as mac address filtering, etc?
2007-12-12T09:41:00.000Z	craptasticles	andymushu	um, the only protection I have is a mac-filtered static ip to the windows side of this same box
2007-12-12T09:44:00.000Z	andymushu	craptasticles	alright, i'm not getting any ideas. this is a really good post on wireless troubleshooting, it had helped me numerous times. http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=571194
2007-12-12T09:45:00.000Z	andymushu	craptasticles	go ahead and follow the stuff on that site, it will at least help you isolate the issue
2007-12-12T09:45:00.000Z	craptasticles	andymushu	thanks.
2007-12-12T09:45:00.000Z	andymushu	craptasticles	sure. good luck
