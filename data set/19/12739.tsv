2005-07-14T16:20:00.000Z	jcoxon		just wondering how to make applications exec on startup of fluxbox
2005-07-14T16:21:00.000Z	jtgameover	jcoxon	you need to put it in your ~/.fluxbox/startfluxbox file
2005-07-14T16:22:00.000Z	jtgameover	jcoxon	CORRECTION: it is your ~/.fluxbox/startup file
2005-07-14T16:22:00.000Z	jcoxon	jtgameover	i just worked that out :)
2005-07-14T16:22:00.000Z	jcoxon	jtgameover	the power of google :)
2005-07-14T16:22:00.000Z	jtgameover	jcoxon	fluxbox is awesome
2005-07-14T16:23:00.000Z	jcoxon	jtgameover	i'm combining it with pogo, even cooler
2005-07-14T16:23:00.000Z	jtgameover	jcoxon	what's pogo
2005-07-14T16:25:00.000Z	jcoxon	jtgameover	just trying to find a screenshot

2005-07-14T16:25:00.000Z	jcoxon	jtgameover	fluxbox provides the perfect manager for it
2005-07-14T16:25:00.000Z	jcoxon	jtgameover	all the others are to crowded
2005-07-14T16:28:00.000Z	jcoxon	jtgameover	brb gonna test it
2005-07-14T16:34:00.000Z	jcoxon	jtgameover	very cool, though it wasn't startup i had to edit, i had to make a new file called apps
2005-07-14T16:35:00.000Z	jcoxon	jtgameover	in .fluxbox/apps you put [startup]  {program}
2005-07-14T16:36:00.000Z	jtgameover	jcoxon	i use startup
2005-07-14T16:36:00.000Z	jcoxon	jtgameover	oh well, i'm happy
