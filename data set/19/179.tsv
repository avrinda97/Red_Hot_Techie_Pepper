2012-08-11T02:00:00.000Z	W4sp	deadmund	Apologies, I didn't see you have been asked directly.
2012-08-11T02:01:00.000Z	deadmund	W4sp	:)
2012-08-11T22:50:00.000Z	deadmund	W4sp	He wants to change it
2012-08-20T01:42:00.000Z	W4sp	deadmund	HAve a look at 'mediabuntu' and see what tools they offer. The progs can be used on your installation, too.
2012-08-21T03:54:00.000Z	W4sp	deadmund	Do you know if ozpy's issue has been addressed with this command 'sudo setpci -s 00:02.0 F4.B=00'?
2012-08-21T03:55:00.000Z	deadmund	W4sp	I don't know how he resolved it but he posted a link to some bug report.  You can scroll back to find it.
2012-08-21T03:56:00.000Z	W4sp	deadmund	I did. I've gone through the post and there a some recommendations. Not sure though if the command I pasted is the right one. I want to make a mental note as ozpy wasn't the only one with the issue.
2012-08-21T03:57:00.000Z	deadmund	W4sp	IDK and he's gone :(
2012-08-21T03:57:00.000Z	deadmund	W4sp	there he is! :P
2012-08-23T22:35:00.000Z	deadmund	W4sp	newbzilla the flash player that is in there is new enough and at this time will perform waay better than the alternatives (in terms of flash objects on the web will work)
2012-08-23T22:35:00.000Z	W4sp	deadmund	the latest avalable is 11 on 12.04
2012-08-23T22:35:00.000Z	deadmund	W4sp	yep
2012-08-23T22:36:00.000Z	W4sp	deadmund	From terminal you can run 'apt-get install flashplugin-installer'.
2012-08-23T22:37:00.000Z	W4sp	deadmund	Sorry, wrong nick.
2012-08-23T22:37:00.000Z	deadmund	W4sp	haha
2012-08-23T22:38:00.000Z	deadmund	W4sp	He already has it installed
2012-08-23T22:38:00.000Z	W4sp	deadmund	Sorry mate. It's so noisy tonight - I thought I have cat'ted my kernel. :-(
2012-08-23T22:39:00.000Z	deadmund	W4sp	ummm... it's ok...
