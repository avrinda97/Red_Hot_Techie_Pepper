2009-06-14T11:07:00.000Z	Cry__Baby	calvin	good luck, hope opera works
2009-06-14T11:07:00.000Z	Cry__Baby	calvin	did you install flash properly?
2009-06-14T11:07:00.000Z	Cry__Baby	calvin	did you sudo apt-get install it?
2009-06-14T11:08:00.000Z	Cry__Baby	calvin	ok try opera
2009-06-14T11:09:00.000Z	Cry__Baby	calvin	did you type this:: " sudo apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree" ?
2009-06-14T11:10:00.000Z	Cry__Baby	calvin	ahh i thiougfht so, thats why I said, did you try  sudo apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree
2009-06-14T11:10:00.000Z	Cry__Baby	calvin	 sudo apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree works perfect for me
2009-06-14T11:11:00.000Z	Cry__Baby	calvin	that explains it
2009-06-14T11:11:00.000Z	Cry__Baby	calvin	try this anyway...  sudo apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree
2009-06-14T11:12:00.000Z	Cry__Baby	calvin	go to a flash testting website?
2009-06-14T11:12:00.000Z	Cry__Baby	calvin	never ever install anythging outside the repos, unless you have made a image first using something like Acronis Trueimage
2009-06-14T11:14:00.000Z	Cry__Baby	calvin	sounds like a conflict
2009-06-14T11:14:00.000Z	Cry__Baby	calvin	learn from the experience and reinstall ubuntu?
2009-06-14T11:15:00.000Z	Cry__Baby	calvin	I only did this and flash works:  sudo apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree
