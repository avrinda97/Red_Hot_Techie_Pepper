2009-01-25T04:05:00.000Z	cwillu	nbeebo	you can't use an output as an input, unless your card supports it (some cards let you use the mic and line inputs as outputs to get surround sound:  if your card doesn't mention surround sound, odds are you can't do it, it's electrically impossible)
2009-01-25T04:06:00.000Z	nbeebo	cwillu	i mean inside the filesyste
