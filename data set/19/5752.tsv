2008-05-06T06:22:00.000Z	Baatti		guys..
2008-05-06T06:22:00.000Z	Baatti		Ubuntu has a live CD right?
2008-05-06T06:23:00.000Z	Baatti		ok, great
2008-05-06T06:23:00.000Z	Baatti		it's almost 700MB, that'll barely fit on my CD..
2008-05-06T06:23:00.000Z	Baatti		now, what are the major differences between Ubuntu and Fedora Core?
2008-05-06T06:24:00.000Z	Baatti		yeah, it's an 80 min
2008-05-06T06:24:00.000Z	Baatti		kk
2008-05-06T06:25:00.000Z	Baatti		now, if I run Ubuntu as a live CD everytime, and don't actually install it on my HD, I'll lose any saved data that I created while using Ubuntu OS, right?
2008-05-06T06:26:00.000Z	Baatti		kk
