2005-09-16T15:49:00.000Z	cute_bettong		and i have written down some of the errors that the box spit out when i tryed to log in
2005-09-16T15:50:00.000Z	cute_bettong		can someone help me fix this ice problem
2005-09-16T15:50:00.000Z	cute_bettong		or is there another display manager that i can use so i can fix gnome?
2005-09-16T15:50:00.000Z	cute_bettong		something i can get through apt-get?
2005-09-16T15:51:00.000Z	cute_bettong		err i mean window manager
2005-09-16T15:51:00.000Z	cute_bettong		is there another windows manager besides kde that i can get for breezy through apt-get?
2005-09-16T15:52:00.000Z	topyli	cute_bettong	there are many. try fluxbox or enlightenment for example
2005-09-16T15:52:00.000Z	topyli	cute_bettong	btw, those really are window managers, unlike gnome and kde :)
2005-09-16T15:53:00.000Z	topyli	cute_bettong	strange, my apt-cache shows fluxbox 0.9
2005-09-16T15:56:00.000Z	topyli	cute_bettong	then you don't have universe enabled i guess
2005-09-17T16:03:00.000Z	topyli	cute_bettong	yes it is sweet. i used it for a while, but i really used to be a huge enlightenment fan
2005-09-17T16:04:00.000Z	topyli	cute_bettong	all your important stuff should be in your home directory. gnome has nothing to do with it
2005-09-17T16:05:00.000Z	topyli	cute_bettong	but you might as well try and fix gnome :)
2005-09-17T16:06:00.000Z	topyli	cute_bettong	you might have to clean up some auth files from your home dir and /tmp. it's a great nuisance :(
2005-09-17T16:07:00.000Z	topyli	cute_bettong	start with ~/.ICEauthority :)
2005-09-17T16:09:00.000Z	topyli	cute_bettong	open a terminal window and remove those files with rm
2005-09-17T16:10:00.000Z	topyli	cute_bettong	no, just the ones related to ICE.
2005-09-17T16:10:00.000Z	topyli	cute_bettong	use 'ls -la' to see all the hidden files and their owners
