2006-08-05T16:45:00.000Z	nathanial		after I log in, my wallpaper is 'edubuntu' wallpaper
2006-08-05T05:52:00.000Z	nathanial		hello folks. A little help please.
2006-08-05T05:53:00.000Z	nathanial		I'm using easyUbuntu to install my media/NVIDIA/etc. packages.
2006-08-05T05:54:00.000Z	nathanial		and I'm getting an "error. fix broken packages first" when trying to install the "Videos: Enable viewing videos embedded in webpages with totem"
2006-08-05T05:54:00.000Z	nathanial		no. everything else was fine.
2006-08-05T05:55:00.000Z	nathanial		this is the only 'package' I can't install
2006-08-05T05:55:00.000Z	sethk	nathanial	that doesn't matter, unless after seeing the error you've tried to install something else
2006-08-05T05:55:00.000Z	sethk	nathanial	because the most recent install may have corrupted the database
2006-08-05T05:55:00.000Z	sethk	nathanial	or may not have completed properly
2006-08-05T05:56:00.000Z	sethk	nathanial	therefore, try to install something else, to see if it is a general problem or really specific to that package
2006-08-05T05:56:00.000Z	sethk	nathanial	you mean workaround?  there is a dpkg command to repair the errors
2006-08-05T05:56:00.000Z	sethk	nathanial	start with what eigenlambda just said
2006-08-05T05:58:00.000Z	sethk	nathanial	ok.  eigenlambda's command doesn't show anything wrong?
2006-08-05T13:41:00.000Z	sethk	nathanial	NTSC is the television spec used in north america.  so your statement makes no sense.
2006-08-05T13:44:00.000Z	nathanial	sethk	i don't want to change the ntsc, but the region code, rather.
