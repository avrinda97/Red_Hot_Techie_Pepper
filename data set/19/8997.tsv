2007-03-02T15:51:00.000Z	famicommie		can someone answer a quick question on cron jobs for me?
2007-03-02T15:51:00.000Z	famicommie		I wrote a script to execute fetchmail, and placed it in the /etc/cron.hourly folder
2007-03-02T15:51:00.000Z	famicommie		What else do I have to do to get it to run?
2007-03-02T15:52:00.000Z	famicommie		would simply placing it in the cron.hourly folder even work?
2007-03-02T15:53:00.000Z	eck	famicommie	fetchmail can run as a daemon
2007-03-02T15:53:00.000Z	famicommie		:O
2007-03-02T15:53:00.000Z	famicommie		how?
2007-03-02T15:53:00.000Z	eck		which is probably preferable
2007-03-02T15:53:00.000Z	eck		i think with -d
2007-03-02T15:53:00.000Z	eck		rtfm :-)
2007-03-02T15:53:00.000Z	famicommie		zomg ty
2007-03-02T15:53:00.000Z	famicommie		I was too busy reading tfm of mutt lol
2007-03-02T15:54:00.000Z	eck		yes, the mutt documentation is, uh, painful
2007-03-02T15:54:00.000Z	eck		i think that's the best term
2007-03-02T15:54:00.000Z	famicommie		haha
2007-03-02T15:56:00.000Z	eck		tbh, i wouldn't recommend using mutt unless you are really deadset on using a cli mail client... it is kind of backwards to be using mutt + fetchmail when we have the modern day wonder of imap
2007-03-02T15:57:00.000Z	eck		and mutt is really retarded about imap and especially the concept of nested folders in a maildir
2007-03-02T16:00:00.000Z	eck		i am curious, why was support for webmin dropped? was it just considered too broken?
2007-03-02T16:00:00.000Z	famicommie	eck	thanks, got fetchmail running on an hourly basis now :D
