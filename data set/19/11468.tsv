2007-07-28T15:02:00.000Z	jowi	locke	usually startx runs what's in ~/.xsession
2007-07-28T15:02:00.000Z	locke	jowi	ok, cool, i think my plan will work then :p
2007-07-28T15:03:00.000Z	jowi	locke	usually you can have it like this in .xsession: xterm & [new line]  xclock & [new line]  exec windowmanager (whatever you want)
2007-07-28T15:04:00.000Z	locke	jowi	well i have it loading what i want from GDM, but i just want to login to terminal rather than GDM for appearance sake
2007-07-28T15:05:00.000Z	jowi	locke	you can try it out without removing GDM. create a user and a custom .xsession file in the user dir. in GDM chose "default" session (that will launch .xsession).
2007-07-28T15:06:00.000Z	jowi	locke	then log in with the new user
2007-07-28T15:06:00.000Z	locke	jowi	hmm , let me see
2007-07-28T15:08:00.000Z	locke	jowi	in GDM { HEED_DEFAULT_DISPLAY_MANAGER=true        |        DEFAULT_DISPLAY_MANAGER_FILE=/etc/X11/default-display-manager } are the display manager options, they don't seem to go by user?
2007-07-28T15:08:00.000Z	locke	jowi	unless i am missing your point..
2007-07-28T15:14:00.000Z	jowi	locke	the option itself say "default system session" in GDM
2007-07-28T15:08:00.000Z	jowi	locke	you misunderstood me. in GDM login screen you can select a session. chose "Default" then login
2007-07-28T15:09:00.000Z	locke	jowi	oh, i see what you mean
2007-07-28T15:09:00.000Z	jowi	locke	no need to go through config files :)
2007-07-28T15:11:00.000Z	locke	jowi	"run xclient script", hmm
2007-07-28T15:11:00.000Z	jowi	locke	what?
2007-07-28T15:12:00.000Z	locke	jowi	that's the session option/description, so im assuming that startx runs according to user, so if this is the case, then if i logged in and used startx it should run what i want, unless....there is a specific xclient script?
2007-07-28T15:14:00.000Z	jowi	locke	oh. on my system the desctiption is "this is the default system session". should be fine.
2007-07-28T15:14:00.000Z	locke	jowi	yea, but when you mouse over that it says "run clientx script"
2007-07-28T15:15:00.000Z	jowi	locke	maybe the description changed in feisty. should be the same.
