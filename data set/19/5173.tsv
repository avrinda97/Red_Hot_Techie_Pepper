2008-08-28T11:06:00.000Z	Theaxiom		I completely hosed my system, I tried reinstalling and it overwrote important data. I don't want that to happen next time I decide to reinstall linux, so is there a guide to setting up usr and home on separate partitions?
2008-08-28T11:07:00.000Z	Theaxiom		I am installing Ubuntu onto a 230GB part of the drive
2008-08-28T11:08:00.000Z	Theaxiom		Maybe I mean etc?
2008-08-28T11:09:00.000Z	nosilver4u	Theaxiom	/etc is for all your system settings, is that what you were thinking of?
2008-08-28T11:09:00.000Z	Theaxiom		Yes
2008-08-28T11:09:00.000Z	Theaxiom		All my installed applications are gone, etc
2008-08-28T11:09:00.000Z	Theaxiom		I don't want that next time
2008-08-28T11:09:00.000Z	Theaxiom		nevermind I can't explain it
2008-08-28T11:10:00.000Z	Theaxiom		I just dont want my stuff uninstalled next time I ever have to reinstall the OS
2008-08-28T11:10:00.000Z	Theaxiom		its too late, it already killed everything
2008-08-28T11:10:00.000Z	nosilver4u	Theaxiom	it would be pretty tough to keep all your installed programs after doing a reinstall, that's kind of the point
2008-08-28T11:11:00.000Z	Theaxiom	nosilver4u	I had important stuff installed, such as MySQL, etc
2008-08-28T11:11:00.000Z	Theaxiom	nosilver4u	So I lost all my databases
2008-08-28T11:11:00.000Z	nosilver4u	Theaxiom	how about /var then, that would save that stuff
2008-08-28T11:11:00.000Z	Theaxiom	nosilver4u	I don't want that to happen next time
2008-08-28T11:12:00.000Z	nosilver4u	Theaxiom	you'd still have to reinstall mysql, but the databases themselves are in /var
2008-08-28T11:12:00.000Z	Theaxiom	nosilver4u	Ok, so that is what I need on a separate partition
2008-08-28T11:12:00.000Z	nosilver4u		yup
2008-08-28T11:14:00.000Z	nosilver4u	Theaxiom	I would think 2-3 GB would be more than sufficient (mostly because apt stores all your downloaded packages there as well)
