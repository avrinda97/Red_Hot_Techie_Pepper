2010-03-08T23:27:00.000Z	iggimin		Thanks guys - Ubuntu 9.10 would not install on the Toshiba laptop unless I had acpi=off - do you think there's a way to install on the thing without disabling acpi?
2010-03-08T23:28:00.000Z	iggimin		every time I loaded from the CD it displayed a LINUXVIDEO error and wouldn't go anywhere unless I set acpi=off
2010-03-08T23:28:00.000Z	iggimin		Is there possibly a different distro that might work better with that particular hardware?
2010-03-08T23:29:00.000Z	Lord-Readman	iggimin	bios update?
2010-03-08T23:30:00.000Z	iggimin	Lord-Readman	that's worth a try. I will look into it. The bummer is I recommended to a grandma this new Toshiba (her old Toshiba worked fine) but it won't take
2010-03-08T23:30:00.000Z	iggimin		:(
2010-03-08T23:30:00.000Z	iggimin		I will check the BIOS update and return
2010-03-08T23:30:00.000Z	iggimin		Thanks!
2010-03-08T23:31:00.000Z	Lord-Readman	iggimin	for one of my toshiba laptops there was an update for XP and update for vista, i put the highest version number on
2010-03-08T23:31:00.000Z	Lord-Readman		and it made ubuntu work with it much better

2010-03-08T23:39:00.000Z	iggimin	Lord-Readman	before you updated your BIOS on the Toshiba, did you have to use "acpi=off" ?
2010-03-08T23:40:00.000Z	Lord-Readman	iggimin	didnt try it because no linux worked
2010-03-08T23:40:00.000Z	Lord-Readman		I put the latest bios on and then it installed fine
2010-03-08T23:41:00.000Z	iggimin	Lord-Readman	oh - you didn't even with acpi=off before updating the BIOS?
2010-03-08T23:41:00.000Z	Lord-Readman	iggimin	i updated the bios in windows
2010-03-08T23:41:00.000Z	Lord-Readman		x
2010-03-08T23:42:00.000Z	iggimin	Lord-Readman	also, you mentioned Vista and XP - this new box has Windows 7 - would you say I need to go into Win7 and update the BIOS from there?
2010-03-08T23:42:00.000Z	Lord-Readman	iggimin	yes go to win7 visit the toshiba website, download the bios for ur machine
