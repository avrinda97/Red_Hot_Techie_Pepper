2009-02-04T19:20:00.000Z	m0RrE		does anyone of you use raid0 ?
2009-02-04T19:21:00.000Z	remoteCTR1	m0RrE	i use raid 5 can i also help you?
2009-02-04T19:22:00.000Z	m0RrE	remoteCTR1	i was just wondering if it does any good to use it.. i was wondering if it will give me any performance boost using raid0
2009-02-04T19:22:00.000Z	remoteCTR1	m0RrE	sure will as you read and write on two disks simultaneously
2009-02-04T19:23:00.000Z	remoteCTR1	m0RrE	the downside of it is if on of the two disks crashes all data are gone
2009-02-04T19:23:00.000Z	m0RrE	remoteCTR1	i have a new motherboard, will i be able to use the integraded raid controller when i install ubuntu?
2009-02-04T19:24:00.000Z	remoteCTR1	m0RrE	wel then the answer to your question is, it doesnt quite doulbe read and write speeds but about 1,7 time faster you can count on
2009-02-04T19:24:00.000Z	m0RrE	remoteCTR1	but do you know if the "hardware controller" on my motherboard will be supported or is it just software raid?
2009-02-04T19:26:00.000Z	remoteCTR1	m0RrE	software raid iworks just fine with ubuntu,  you can of course try to set up a hardware raid in bios but to find out if that is being supported by ubuntu...
2009-02-04T19:27:00.000Z	m0RrE	remoteCTR1	aight, i tried to install on a raid0 setup with the ordinary disc, but then i read that i have to use the alternative cd
2009-02-04T19:28:00.000Z	remoteCTR1	m0RrE	that can be i dunno precisely if the standard supports it as i use the alternate per default...
2009-02-04T19:28:00.000Z	remoteCTR1	m0RrE	go for it!
2009-02-04T19:29:00.000Z	m0RrE	remoteCTR1	btw, is it necessary to create the swap disk?
2009-02-04T19:29:00.000Z	remoteCTR1	m0RrE	sure as hell is
2009-02-04T19:30:00.000Z	remoteCTR1	m0RrE	know what the swap is?
2009-02-04T19:30:00.000Z	m0RrE	remoteCTR1	a backup when i run out of ram?
2009-02-04T19:31:00.000Z	remoteCTR1	m0RrE	backup, well  yes linux writes back information from your ram into the swap to free some space in the ram in case you need som, if it cant write the infos back to somewhere youre in deep sh**
2009-02-04T19:32:00.000Z	m0RrE	remoteCTR1	but i have 6gb ram so i think i'll be fine?
2009-02-04T19:33:00.000Z	remoteCTR1	m0RrE	no matter how much ram you got always use a swap partition
