2008-05-06T01:29:00.000Z	dulpit		hey, i'm having trouble with Hardy Heron - I just installed it today (total noob here) and I am unable to access more than 1 workspace, i can see 4 but i can only use workspace 1... Am i missing something obvious to access the rest?
2008-05-06T01:30:00.000Z	dulpit		@ ramukmar: nope. I can see them but they are greyed out...
2008-05-06T01:31:00.000Z	dulpit		nothing happens then
2008-05-06T01:31:00.000Z	dulpit		and ya, i do have compiz...
2008-05-06T01:31:00.000Z	dulpit		(i want to use the Desktop CUbe thing i've seen so much on youtube)
2008-05-06T01:33:00.000Z	Jobias	dulpit	have you tried changing the number of workspaces? and then changing it back?
2008-05-06T01:34:00.000Z	dulpit	Jobias	- ya, i've tried switching between 1 - 4 - loads...
2008-05-06T01:35:00.000Z	Jobias	dulpit	this might sound kind of stupid, but did you also vary the number of columns and rows while you did it?
2008-05-06T01:36:00.000Z	Jobias	dulpit	when you run gconf-editor /apps/workspace_switcher_applet/prefs do you get any errors?
2008-05-06T01:37:00.000Z	Jobias	dulpit	yes
2008-05-06T01:38:00.000Z	Jobias	dulpit	try using it to change the number of workspaces; if it throws you an error when you try to do so, tell me what it is
2008-05-06T01:39:00.000Z	Jobias	dulpit	alrighty, one second
2008-05-06T01:40:00.000Z	Jobias	dulpit	now i don't have an ubuntu box in front of me, i'm just going from (http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=258690). you'll need to navigate to the WorkspaceSwitcherApplet, and find out what applet value it has. then find the appropriate applet and try manually switching the number of rows and/or the display_all_workspaces value
2008-05-06T01:44:00.000Z	Jobias	dulpit	:(
2008-05-06T01:44:00.000Z	Jobias	dulpit	i'm at a loss then. sorry :(
2008-05-06T01:47:00.000Z	Jobias	dulpit	actually, out of curiosity, do the keyboard shortcuts for switching workspaces work?
2008-05-06T01:47:00.000Z	Jobias	dulpit	i think the default shortcuts are ctrl + alt + <arrow key>
2008-05-06T01:48:00.000Z	Jobias	dulpit	if they work, then the problem isn't with the workspaces, but with gnome-panel
2008-05-06T01:48:00.000Z	Jobias	dulpit	alright, then i don't know :(
