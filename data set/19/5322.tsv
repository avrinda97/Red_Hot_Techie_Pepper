2008-07-25T17:36:00.000Z	Peace_Keeper	MooCows	Hello, Font smoothing is under System > Preferences > Appearance. Sorry if someone beat me to it, I could see a reply.
2008-07-25T17:38:00.000Z	MooCows	Peace_Keeper	 alrighty.  Now if I just figure out my externals
2008-07-25T17:39:00.000Z	Peace_Keeper	MooCows	External hard drives automount by default. Have you plug it in and nothing has happened?
2008-07-25T17:40:00.000Z	MooCows	Peace_Keeper	they are plugged in.  I go to /media/ and only see Cdrom0
2008-07-25T17:40:00.000Z	Peace_Keeper	MooCows	Are your externals formatted with an NTFS file system, by any chance?
2008-07-25T17:41:00.000Z	MooCows	Peace_Keeper	yes, I am running Ubuntu atop of Windows.
2008-07-25T17:41:00.000Z	MooCows	Peace_Keeper	Amazingly it still runs better than XP.
2008-07-25T17:41:00.000Z	Peace_Keeper	MooCows	Atop as in a virtual system?
2008-07-25T17:41:00.000Z	MooCows	Peace_Keeper	I mean I clicked the Install With Windows, not a virtual machine.
2008-07-25T17:42:00.000Z	MooCows	Peace_Keeper	I tried Ubuntu over VMware, and it ran like crap
2008-07-25T17:44:00.000Z	Peace_Keeper	MooCows	Ah, yeah, go figure. What I was going to say is that if an NTFS filesystem has been unplugged without being unmounted, Ubuntu will not mount it. It's a data protection thing, and a right nuisance.
2008-07-25T17:45:00.000Z	MooCows	Peace_Keeper	I have thought about going full linux.. I don't know yet.  But I can't lose data on the drives, so I figure I will wait for that jump.
2008-07-25T17:45:00.000Z	Peace_Keeper	MooCows	Solutions are; plug it into a windows machine, and ensure you use the "Safely remove hardware" function. Or there is a command line switch that can force it to mount.
2008-07-25T17:52:00.000Z	Peace_Keeper	MooCows	116MB sounds about right. That number won't include anything it already has.
2008-07-25T17:52:00.000Z	MooCows	Peace_Keeper	Ok, I just hope no one else gets on youtube or myspace today lol
2008-07-25T17:56:00.000Z	Peace_Keeper	MooCows	I would right click on the icon and disable  networking.
2008-07-25T17:56:00.000Z	MooCows	Peace_Keeper	I need something (like cron) to terminate it at 5 AM
2008-07-25T17:58:00.000Z	MooCows	Peace_Keeper	automatically that is.  My Internet has the FAP (fair access policy) open window from 2-5 AM , where I can download whatever I want.  And I don't trust download managers to stop at 5 AM themselves
2008-07-25T17:58:00.000Z	Peace_Keeper	MooCows	Yeah, my mates have something similar. I'm pondering how to do it.
