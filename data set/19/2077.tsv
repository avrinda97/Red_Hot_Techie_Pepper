2010-07-11T14:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	vasu	 If you want to totally delete the windows partitions, You can do so with fdisk , instead of gparted, or the installer. Theres been issues with the installer not seeing all parittions for some odd reason
2010-07-11T14:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	vasu	 unallocated space wont show in the places menu.   If you want to use teh whole HD for linux. use fdisk, and delete all the partitions, and let the installer auto partition it by telling it to use the 'whole disk'
2010-07-11T14:08:00.000Z	vasu	Dr_Willis	I want not the xp to be writtenover.
2010-07-11T14:08:00.000Z	vasu	Dr_Willis	Also, IN the places menu, I get teh list. but not on gparetd or on partitioner..
2010-07-11T14:09:00.000Z	vasu	Dr_Willis	other than wipeoutentire harddisk.. There is NO other way to... :( ??
2010-07-11T14:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	vasu	 you may want to check the forums. Theres been some issues with the Installer partionier not seeing drives properly. I always partiotion my disks with fdisk befor i even start the Partioner. so i never have had the issue.
2010-07-11T14:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	vasu	 you could try a gparted live cd. and see what it sees. and let it resize things how you want.
2010-07-11T14:10:00.000Z	vasu	Dr_Willis	so i have to get gparted live disk .. Downloading ? is free it ?
2010-07-11T14:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	vasu	 its free like ubuntu. so yes.
2010-07-11T14:10:00.000Z	vasu	Dr_Willis	ok.
2010-07-11T14:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	vasu	 theres several gparted type 'rescue' cds out there. Must have tools for any PC tool box.
2010-07-11T14:11:00.000Z	vasu	Dr_Willis	:( . I am at a friend's , actually... i wanted to isntall ubuntu not replacing widnows. but alongside xp.
2011-02-14T19:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	vasu	  ive seen others that have the reverse problem. Never seen a definitive 'fix' for it. The forums may have some help,
