2007-02-13T13:30:00.000Z	gOLdenHaWK3D	unop	ok, and any other place i migt empty? to free space?
2007-02-13T13:32:00.000Z	unop	gOLdenHaWK3D	 remove old logs from /var/log/ . purge/deinstall unneeded software . install and use !localepurge and finally manually clean out your ~/ directory
2007-02-13T13:32:00.000Z	gOLdenHaWK3D	unop	thanx. trying
2007-02-13T13:57:00.000Z	gOLdenHaWK3D	unop	do i delete all files in /var/log to empty space?
2007-02-13T13:58:00.000Z	unop	gOLdenHaWK3D	 no no .. just the old ones -- e.g. the old versions of /var/log/messages might be messages.0.gz, messages.1.gz etc
2007-02-13T13:58:00.000Z	gOLdenHaWK3D	unop	oh got it!!! but they are too many!!!
2007-02-13T14:00:00.000Z	unop	gOLdenHaWK3D	 usually -- you can remove all the ones matching *gz .. check them with this command - ls /var/log/*gz  . if you are happy that they are all old .. you can use this - sudo rm -/var/log/*gz
2007-02-13T14:00:00.000Z	gOLdenHaWK3D	unop	thanx
2007-02-13T14:02:00.000Z	gOLdenHaWK3D	unop	oh! :P

2007-02-13T14:09:00.000Z	unop	gOLdenHaWK3D	 yep, localepurge is a good thing, it monitors when you install packages next and will clean up after you then too :)
