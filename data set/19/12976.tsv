2007-02-28T10:26:00.000Z	ki4cgp		My wife and I run this box simultaneously with different X sessions (CTRL+ALT+F7 and F9)  Is there a way I can set up a vnc server so sessions are available for both desktops?  I'm running edgy.
2007-02-28T10:26:00.000Z	Dr_willis	ki4cgp	 you could run a vncserver session, and then connect to it from either desktiop with vncviewer
2007-02-28T10:27:00.000Z	Dr_willis	ki4cgp	 theres lots of neat tricks one can do with vnc.. depends on exadtly you are wanting to do with it.
2007-02-28T10:27:00.000Z	ki4cgp	Dr_willis	I'm wanting to connect to currently open sessions
2007-02-28T10:28:00.000Z	Dr_willis	ki4cgp	 you mean you want to view desktop 1 from desktop #2 and  visa-versa
2007-02-28T10:28:00.000Z	ki4cgp	Dr_willis	I'm sometimes out of town, and the wife might be on her desktop, but I'
2007-02-28T10:29:00.000Z	ki4cgp	Dr_willis	I'm sometimes out of town, and the wife might be on her desktop, but I'd like to log into my running desktop and not disturb her
2007-02-28T10:29:00.000Z	Dr_willis	ki4cgp	 you could just start your desktop in a vncserver session.. that way it stays running, and you can connect to it.. but vnc over the internet may not be that secure.. best to use ssh tunnles with it .. Or course theres a dozen ways to do this stuff.. depending on exactly how you want to do things.
2007-02-28T10:30:00.000Z	ki4cgp	Dr_willis	Yeah, I normally port forward using ssh
2007-02-28T10:30:00.000Z	Dr_willis	ki4cgp	 for a linux to linux box.. you may want to check into that 'freenx' stuff.
2007-02-28T10:31:00.000Z	Dr_willis	ki4cgp	 i just 'ssh' to the box. run vncserver, and then connect with vncviewer.. but thats not shareing the currently running desktop.. kde/gnome have that feature some how built in.. but i never use it.
2007-02-28T10:33:00.000Z	ki4cgp	Dr_willis	right.  That is the problem.  I'm always running irc and multiple IMs so it often has messages waiting on me, so a persistent desktop I could log into without bothering the wife is what I'm looking for.
2007-02-28T10:34:00.000Z	ki4cgp	Dr_willis	I realize also that this is asking a lot from several different facets of running any linux
2007-02-28T10:34:00.000Z	Dr_willis	ki4cgp	 set up gnome or kde to share the currently runing desktop is one way.. or run a 'vncserver' with all the stuff in it..  (it will be a hidden desktop) then run vncviewer to connect. (even locally ) which is a little weird.
2007-02-28T10:35:00.000Z	Dr_willis	ki4cgp	 i normally keep a minimal vncserver desktop in the background all the time running my torrent client. that way i can exit out of X  and keep it running.
2007-02-28T10:36:00.000Z	ki4cgp	Dr_willis	Yep.  You know the value of that then.  Kinda odd, yes, but its handy
2007-02-28T10:36:00.000Z	ki4cgp	Dr_willis	Perhaps I have a couple of directions I can take from the last suggestion.  That's do-able I think
2007-02-28T10:37:00.000Z	Dr_willis	ki4cgp	 vnc is really a big 'multi-tool' :) with a lot of neat tricks..  with kde/gnome getting to support it now- the ability to share the currently running desktop is another blade- in the vnc-multi-tool-knife. :)
2007-02-28T10:38:00.000Z	ki4cgp	Dr_willis	Indeed.  I'm looking to see what I can google on that
