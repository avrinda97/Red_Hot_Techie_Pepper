2012-05-30T16:59:00.000Z	echo083		how to know the maximum amount of ram that my laptop will support ?
2012-05-30T17:00:00.000Z	gvo	echo083	check manuf, specs.
2012-05-30T17:00:00.000Z	echo083	gvo	where ?
2012-05-30T17:00:00.000Z	gvo	echo083	search for you make and model on line
2012-05-30T17:03:00.000Z	echo083	gvo	ok i found it even i expected a geek linux command :) whatever do you know if it is better to have have two identical ram memories stick or we don't care ?
2012-05-30T17:04:00.000Z	gvo	echo083	not important unless the computer is old
2012-05-30T17:05:00.000Z	echo083	gvo	ok ! we don't care about brand too ? i can have a 2Gb samsung and a 4G crucial for example or it is better the same brand for the two sticks ?
2012-05-30T17:06:00.000Z	gvo	echo083	better yes I don't know if you can mix sizes that well.  Also it's best if they are the same speed.
2012-05-30T17:07:00.000Z	gvo	echo083	It probably won't hurt to try it.
2012-05-30T17:07:00.000Z	echo083	gvo	if i had them i'll try !! but i need to buy them first :) i'll take a two sticks kit. anyway thanks for your help
2012-05-30T17:16:00.000Z	echo083	gvo	are you still here ?
2012-05-30T17:21:00.000Z	gvo	echo083	Yes
2012-05-30T17:22:00.000Z	echo083	gvo	the command dmidecode --type memory returns "Physical Memory Array Maximum Capacity: 4 GB Number Of Devices: 2" is it 4 GB by slot or for both ?
2012-05-30T17:22:00.000Z	gvo	echo083	4 total
2012-05-30T17:22:00.000Z	gvo	echo083	so you need 2 sticks of 2 gb
2012-05-30T17:23:00.000Z	echo083	gvo	cool :) 8Gb would have be cool it is too bad :(
2012-05-30T17:24:00.000Z	echo083	gvo	by chance are you a lottery winner or someone rich ?
2012-05-30T17:24:00.000Z	gvo	echo083	Well if I were the former I'd be the latter, but no.
2012-05-30T17:25:00.000Z	echo083	gvo	and/or would be my question logically correct ?
