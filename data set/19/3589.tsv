2009-07-08T18:33:00.000Z	StarLionIsaac		hmm, little wireless issue - two laptops, both the same except one on intrepid one on jaunty. wireless network is on WPA2, I can't change that. Intrepid connects fine, Jaunty fails every time
2009-07-08T18:35:00.000Z	oskar-	StarLionIsaac	 have you tried to watch "tail -f /var/log/wpa_supplicant.log" (or similar named) while connecting?
2009-07-08T18:36:00.000Z	StarLionIsaac	oskar-	no, though someone else suggested trying a wpa_supplicant, which actually crashed jaunty entirely, and forced me to fresh install
2009-07-08T18:38:00.000Z	oskar-	StarLionIsaac	 ubuntu is using wpa_supplicant for connecting to wpa2 networks, afaik
2009-07-08T18:39:00.000Z	StarLionIsaac	oskar-	I can try reinstalling yet again, but since it's a fresh install, I assumed it'd work as it does on the intrepid one - right out of the box, no issues
2009-07-08T18:40:00.000Z	oskar-	StarLionIsaac	 yes, it should... try watching, what error causes wpa_supplicant to not connect
2009-07-08T18:41:00.000Z	StarLionIsaac	oskar-	not sure, I'm using the gnome network manager applet, it tries connecting, asks for the password for the network several times, then disconnects, nothing extra
2009-07-08T18:42:00.000Z	oskar-	StarLionIsaac	 as i said, try: "tail -f /var/log/wpa_supplicant.log", disable wireless networking, enable it, then connect and see, what is added to the log file
2009-07-08T18:43:00.000Z	StarLionIsaac	oskar-	alright, back in a few with result
2009-07-08T18:50:00.000Z	StarLionIsaac	oskar-	returns CTRL-EVENT-DISCONNECTED - Disconnect event - remove keys then Authentication with 00:00:00:00:00:00 timed out.
2009-07-08T18:52:00.000Z	oskar-	StarLionIsaac	 hm, that's not much... does the ap accept the mac of the wlan device?
2009-07-08T18:53:00.000Z	oskar-	StarLionIsaac	 you could also try to watch the output of "sudo iwconfig" (call it multiple times while connecting), to see, if the device get associated with the ap and gets a key
2009-07-08T18:54:00.000Z	oskar-	StarLionIsaac	 is it the same network device, that is used? or only a similar? every network device has a different mac address burnt into
2009-07-08T18:55:00.000Z	StarLionIsaac	oskar-	it's the same network device on both, though I have third computer which has a different device also on jaunty, that fails too
2009-07-08T18:59:00.000Z	StarLionIsaac	oskar-	it does appear to get a key and connect, but that's as far as it seems to go, it seems to me like it's not sending the network password
2009-07-08T19:02:00.000Z	oskar-	StarLionIsaac	 does it expect dhcp which is perhaps not there? you could also try to run wpa_supplicant manually to get more debugging output and find out what causes the problem
2009-07-08T19:03:00.000Z	StarLionIsaac	oskar-	I don't think so, how exactly do you run it manually, and I'll have a look and try to find out
2009-07-08T19:05:00.000Z	oskar-	StarLionIsaac	 you have to tell the running wpa_supplicant instance to not configure you wlan device (disable wireless?), then setup a simple wpa_supplicant.conf configuration file (google will find many examples) and run wpa_supplicant as root with the options for device, mode and so on (wpa_supplicant --help will tell possible options)
2009-07-08T19:06:00.000Z	StarLionIsaac	oskar-	thanks, hopefully this will solve it
