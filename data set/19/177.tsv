2012-07-15T16:49:00.000Z	pckchem	bixop	Sorry, I'm not clear on your question. Do you need help moving the package to the computer, or finding the package?
2012-07-15T16:50:00.000Z	pckchem	bixop	if the former, why not use a usb thumb drive?
2012-07-15T16:50:00.000Z	bixop	pckchem	i found the package, i need help installing it since the machine doesn't seem to let me do it.
2012-07-15T16:50:00.000Z	pckchem	bixop	can you give me a more precise error message?
2012-07-15T16:50:00.000Z	bixop	pckchem	i have it on a 12.04 Cd
2012-07-15T16:50:00.000Z	bixop	pckchem	1 sec
2012-07-15T16:54:00.000Z	bixop	pckchem	so L3top came back to help now, thx
2012-07-15T17:23:00.000Z	bixop	pckchem	maybe you could help me?
2012-07-15T17:24:00.000Z	pckchem	bixop	I have totally tuned out. Can you re-ask with a summary of what you tried? Maybe copy the converstation into a pastebin?
2012-07-15T17:34:00.000Z	bixop	pckchem	http://paste.ubuntu.com/1093174/
2012-07-15T17:36:00.000Z	pckchem	bixop	So to summarize: You can see the package, but it is asking you to download more files, which you cannot do, because your internet isn't working yet?
2012-07-15T17:37:00.000Z	bixop	pckchem	basically yeah. and also the system doesn't grant me access to install the files on the cd - which i suppose should be enough to install the package. at least according to the ubuntu documentation
2012-07-15T17:43:00.000Z	pckchem	bixop	Are you doing all this from the liveCD too?
2012-07-15T17:43:00.000Z	bixop	pckchem	no, i just recently loaded the livCD
2012-07-15T17:44:00.000Z	pckchem	bixop	So it doesn't work on the install ubuntu either.
2012-07-15T17:44:00.000Z	pckchem	bixop	installed (as in, booted from the HDD)
2012-07-15T17:46:00.000Z	bixop	pckchem	it doesn't work from the install either. the only thing i tried from the liveCD was sudo fsck -f /dev/sda1
2012-07-15T17:47:00.000Z	pckchem	bixop	I am stumped then. The only suggestion I can offer is to grab the package you need on another computer and copy it over with a flash drive.
2012-07-15T17:49:00.000Z	bixop	pckchem	the weirdest thing is that it says access denied when i am doing a sudo command. Well I do have the package and the file, but on the liveCD.
