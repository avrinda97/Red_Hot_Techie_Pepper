2007-04-27T07:38:00.000Z	Ademan		hey in fiesty is compiz the default wm? (whether or not all the fancy features are turned on)
2007-04-27T07:38:00.000Z	Ademan		cause i turned off desktop effects, and i still see a compiz process and no metacity process
2007-04-27T07:39:00.000Z	Ademan		regardless, so you're saying metacity SHOULD kick in?
2007-04-27T07:39:00.000Z	jo_	Ademan	check out system>preferences>desktop effects
2007-04-27T07:40:00.000Z	jo_	Ademan	oh thats strange
2007-04-27T07:40:00.000Z	Ademan	jo_	? that metacity isn't starting up?
2007-04-27T07:40:00.000Z	jo_	Ademan	strange stuff, desktop effects turnd off?
2007-04-27T07:41:00.000Z	Ademan	jo_	yep, i might try restarting, or at least starting a new session
2007-04-27T07:41:00.000Z	jo_	Ademan	u could disable composite on option in xorg etc..
2007-04-27T07:42:00.000Z	Ademan	jo_	you think it detects that and goes "lawl turn on compiz"
2007-04-27T07:42:00.000Z	jo_	Ademan	but till u discover culprit u can disable gl in xorg and compiz will not work, if it irritates u...
2007-04-27T07:44:00.000Z	jo_	Ademan	option "composite" "disable" to start with
2007-04-27T07:44:00.000Z	Ademan	jo_	well i've setup beryl on my own before, i know more of xorg.conf than i ever wanted to
2007-04-27T07:44:00.000Z	Ademan	jo_	but like i said i'm gonna try a new session first
2007-04-27T07:45:00.000Z	jo_	Ademan	aha u have beryl installed? and running?
2007-04-27T07:45:00.000Z	Ademan	jo_	oh no, previous install
2007-04-27T07:45:00.000Z	jo_	Ademan	ok...
2007-04-27T07:46:00.000Z	Ademan	jo_	i found out the problem too, the "enable desktop effects" button actually functions like a checkbox, which wasn't very clear in my current theme, i'm running metacity now
2007-04-27T07:46:00.000Z	jo_	Ademan	yeah, found it strange, good for u!!
