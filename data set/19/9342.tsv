2009-01-12T20:38:00.000Z	andy__		hi. I updated yesterday. Now I cant move my mouse.
2009-01-12T20:39:00.000Z	Slart	andy__	tried reconnecting it?
2009-01-12T20:39:00.000Z	andy__	Slart	yes
2009-01-12T20:39:00.000Z	andy__	Slart	I am in virtual terminal lol, only keyboard shortcut i could remember
2009-01-12T20:40:00.000Z	Slart	andy__	run "tail -f /var/log/syslog" in a  terminal, reconnect the mouse and pastebin the result
2009-01-12T20:40:00.000Z	Slart	andy__	hehe
2009-01-12T20:40:00.000Z	Slart	andy__	install pastebinit.. "sudo apt-get install pastebinit"
2009-01-12T20:41:00.000Z	Slart	andy__	then you can just do "tail -f /var/log/syslog > tempfile.txt"
2009-01-12T20:41:00.000Z	Slart	andy__	check the tempfile so nothing secret is there.. then pastebin it by using "cat tempfile.txt | pastebinit"
2009-01-12T20:41:00.000Z	Slart	andy__	you'll get a pastebin url back.

2009-01-12T20:45:00.000Z	Slart	andy__	ok.. it seems to find your mouse alright..strange that it doesn't want to use it..
2009-01-12T20:46:00.000Z	Slart	andy__	you're sure that the mouse hasn't died on you in some way? does it work in another computer?
2009-01-12T20:47:00.000Z	andy__	Slart	Dont have any others atm, but yes, i am pretty sure, and yesterday in an attempt to fix my corrupted ipod i installed some third party debian software, but i added debian repos and upgraded half my installation from the debian repo by accident. So I'm pretty much screwed and will reinstall soon. But for now, can I fix my mouse?
2009-01-12T20:47:00.000Z	Slart	andy__	ouch.. who knows what that might have messed up..
2009-01-12T20:48:00.000Z	andy__	Slart	New kernel doesnt even boot up, lol.
2009-01-12T20:48:00.000Z	andy__	Slart	But I guess I can use lynx for now. You wouldnt know any command line MSN programs would you? :)_
2009-01-12T20:51:00.000Z	Slart	andy__	hmm.. command line msn.. there is one im for command line.. can't remember the name though
2009-01-12T20:51:00.000Z	Slart	andy__	but msn seems to be broken for everyone anyways.. so you might as well wait until you've reinstalled
