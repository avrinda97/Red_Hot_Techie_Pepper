2011-01-15T01:47:00.000Z	iamjebus		Hi. Just installed Ubuntu 10.10 amd64. Also installed the proprietary Nvidia driver for my GTX 580. But for some reason Ubuntu looks like this: http://i.imgur.com/Qe15W.jpg and not like this: http://softfive.com/files/uploads/Ubuntu.jpg (which it does on other computers I've installed Ubuntu on)?
2011-01-15T01:47:00.000Z	undecim	iamjebus	You mean the theme?
2011-01-15T01:48:00.000Z	iamjebus	undecim	Well, yeah, some of it seems to use the ambience theme and other stuff looks "old"
2011-01-15T01:48:00.000Z	undecim	iamjebus	Have you relogged Ubuntu since it was like this?
2011-01-15T01:49:00.000Z	undecim	iamjebus	I used to have a similar issue when gnome-settings-daemon didn't start right
2011-01-15T01:49:00.000Z	iamjebus	undecim	I rebooted after installing the nvidia driver, will try again
2011-01-15T01:53:00.000Z	iamjebus	undecim	hmm.. still not looking right :/
2011-01-15T01:53:00.000Z	undecim	iamjebus	What shows up as your thme under appearance?
2011-01-15T01:53:00.000Z	iamjebus	undecim	Ambiance
2011-01-15T01:53:00.000Z	undecim	iamjebus	change it to another
2011-01-15T01:53:00.000Z	undecim	iamjebus	And see if it changes it
2011-01-15T01:53:00.000Z	iamjebus	undecim	tried before, doesn't help
2011-01-15T01:54:00.000Z	undecim	iamjebus	Have you tried alt+f2 and type "killall gnome-panel"?
2011-01-15T01:54:00.000Z	iamjebus	undecim	will try
2011-01-15T01:54:00.000Z	undecim	iamjebus	Current WINE version is 1.3.10
2011-01-15T01:55:00.000Z	iamjebus	undecim	Doesn't help :/ This is really weird
2011-01-15T01:55:00.000Z	undecim	iamjebus	Is it anything other than the panel?
2011-01-15T01:57:00.000Z	undecim	iamjebus	A agree, that is odd. Though that means that the problem is with GTK.
2011-01-15T01:58:00.000Z	iamjebus	undecim	Hmm... Very weird indeed. Will try reinstalling, perhaps something fucked up. Thanks for trying though :).
