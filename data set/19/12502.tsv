2005-11-09T13:11:00.000Z	CookedGryphon	erUSUL	thanks
2005-11-09T13:14:00.000Z	CookedGryphon	erUSUL	it says System startup links for /etc/init.d/gdm already exist. will it have done anything?
2005-11-09T13:15:00.000Z	erUSUL	CookedGryphon	then it is not a problem of startup scripts for some reason gdm won't start
2005-11-09T13:15:00.000Z	erUSUL	CookedGryphon	check the config of gdm and the logs
