2009-07-30T16:46:00.000Z	pkkm		Few days ago "Suspend" button disappeared. How to fix that?
2009-07-30T16:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	pkkm	 you are not using KDM to launch gnome, or gdm to launch kde are you? ive seen the logout options change if you do that.
2009-07-30T16:48:00.000Z	pkkm	Dr_Willis	I use gdm and gnome
2009-09-05T19:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	pkkm	 official or unofficial? :)
2009-09-05T19:44:00.000Z	pkkm	Dr_Willis	does not matter, must run on 64 MB RAM, Pentium 2
2009-09-05T19:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	pkkm	 64mb  Ugh.. - More ram would be a good idea. You may have to go to a Nonubuntu disrto to get that thing going decently well.
2009-09-05T19:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	pkkm	 puppy linux, Dam Small Linux, or perhaps Tiny Core Linux.
2009-11-12T18:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	pkkm	imagemagick tools (spelling?) can do thgat i think
2010-04-10T16:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	pkkm	 you dont.
2010-04-10T16:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	pkkm	 whixch part of gnomr
2010-04-10T16:47:00.000Z	pkkm	Dr_Willis	Whole GNOME - active program is working, but whole GNOME is hung up.
2010-04-10T16:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	pkkm	 you could kill/restart one at a time.. but  the whole X may crash at any time
2010-04-10T16:48:00.000Z	pkkm	Dr_Willis	Alt+Tab is not working, panels are not working and I can't click.
2010-04-10T16:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	pkkm	 i would save all data and restart X.
2010-04-10T16:51:00.000Z	pkkm	Dr_Willis	thanks
2010-09-06T19:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	pkkm	 i wonder why they dont work. most are just front ends to the various backend tools
2010-09-06T19:19:00.000Z	pkkm	Dr_Willis	these backend tools crash during creating a DVD, in both cases.
2010-09-06T19:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	pkkm	 thats odd.. but these other tools might use the same backend tools.
2010-09-06T19:20:00.000Z	pkkm	Dr_Willis	I'll try them and see.
