2012-02-03T11:12:00.000Z	noyb		hello.  using ubuntu 11.10... still trying to mount cdrom... slowly figuring it out... now when i try to mount using gmount i get "pixmap error."  time to go back to pencil and paper  :-)  any ideas?
2012-02-03T11:13:00.000Z	wiggmpk	noyb	your cdrom doesnt mount automatically when you insert the disc?
2012-02-03T11:14:00.000Z	wiggmpk	noyb	do you have a cdrom that you absolutely know works? not damage?
2012-02-03T11:16:00.000Z	wiggmpk	noyb	in terminal, what does this say "ls /dev/cd*
2012-02-03T11:18:00.000Z	wiggmpk	noyb	note the * after it, "ls /dev/cd* "
2012-02-03T11:22:00.000Z	wiggmpk	noyb	hmm, I think this should try and mount it "sudo mount /dev/cdrom /mnt"
2012-02-03T11:25:00.000Z	wiggmpk	noyb	well then do "cd /mnt" and then "ls" to see whats there
2012-02-03T11:32:00.000Z	wiggmpk	noyb	then there is probably a driver issue with your cdrom drive (at least it indicates that) or a program with the actual drive (physically)
2012-02-03T11:35:00.000Z	wiggmpk	noyb	did you install from scratch (alternate cd) or through a livecd?
2012-02-03T11:37:00.000Z	wiggmpk	noyb	lol right, but was it through a LiveCD (where you had a fully functioning Ubuntu loaded) or through the older text menu driven installer?
2012-02-03T11:39:00.000Z	wiggmpk	noyb	hmm, then I might seek a second opinion for troubleshooting, because the drive shouldnt have an issue wiht drivers if you used the livecd
2012-02-03T11:40:00.000Z	wiggmpk	noyb	it should, or  a box to ask you what you want to do. but if it gives you an input/output error that's not good
2012-02-03T11:41:00.000Z	wiggmpk	noyb	is there a disc or cd image on your desktop?
2012-02-03T11:43:00.000Z	wiggmpk	noyb	yeah, like something that would indicate a disc in the drive on your desktop (icon)
2012-02-03T11:48:00.000Z	wiggmpk	noyb	probably repeat the command with "sudo" in front
2012-02-03T11:49:00.000Z	wiggmpk	noyb	oh wait, it should show you permissions (sorry brain fart)
2012-02-03T12:01:00.000Z	noyb	wiggmpk	& Ben64, thx for the help... it is appreciated.
2012-02-03T12:01:00.000Z	wiggmpk	noyb	np bud, wish I could have helped more (been saying that a lot tonight)
2012-02-03T12:06:00.000Z	wiggmpk	noyb	np buddy =P
