2007-12-16T19:24:00.000Z	ompaul	zobban	that you can burn many times - you are leaving us a little short on information
2007-12-16T19:25:00.000Z	ompaul	zobban	and have you done what I suggest - which makes a DVD unless you are talking about transccoding in which case you got to do some more work
2007-12-16T19:33:00.000Z	ompaul	zobban	have a look at the application: dvdauthor I think that might be what you want. if someone does not have the answer to your question or answers it not the way you expect it to be answered, restate the question and this time change the way you talk about it - helps us help you
