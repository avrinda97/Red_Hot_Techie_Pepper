2006-12-10T07:44:00.000Z	craigbass1976		How do I make ubuntu ask for the root password rather than the user's when I click on something like printer config?  Or even when I do a sudo command in the command line.
2006-12-10T07:45:00.000Z	Arwen	craigbass1976	basically you have to sudo passwd root and then visudo
2006-12-10T07:45:00.000Z	craigbass1976	Arwen	so /etc/sudoers IS the file I'm loking to edit?  Ok, that's where I looked first but saw nothing that struck me as the solution.
2006-12-10T07:46:00.000Z	Arwen	craigbass1976	you have to tack rootpw somewhere
2006-12-10T07:46:00.000Z	craigbass1976	Arwen	what do you mean?  I gave root a password
2006-12-10T07:46:00.000Z	Arwen	craigbass1976	rootpw is a parameter - you did passwd root?
2006-12-10T07:47:00.000Z	craigbass1976	Arwen	I did sudo passwd
2006-12-10T07:47:00.000Z	Arwen	craigbass1976	on the line with "Defaults" on it, add !rootpw at the end
2006-12-10T08:04:00.000Z	craigbass1976	Arwen	I still get asked for my pass and not root's.  The line goes Defaults        !lecture,tty_tickets,!fqdn,!rootpw
2006-12-10T08:05:00.000Z	Arwen	craigbass1976	it asks you for yours, but enter root's
2006-12-10T08:06:00.000Z	craigbass1976	Arwen	but I want mine to stop working
2006-12-10T08:06:00.000Z	Arwen	craigbass1976	does your still work?
2006-12-10T08:06:00.000Z	Arwen	craigbass1976	have you tried?
2006-12-10T08:06:00.000Z	craigbass1976	Arwen	yes
2006-12-10T08:06:00.000Z	craigbass1976	Arwen	I just installed jackd with my pass
2006-12-10T08:06:00.000Z	Arwen	craigbass1976	hmm.... run sudo from the command line and see if you can enter ro0t's password
2006-12-10T08:07:00.000Z	Arwen	craigbass1976	why would you ever want rootpw anyway?
2006-12-10T08:07:00.000Z	craigbass1976	Arwen	it would ease my transition from Fedora.
2006-12-10T08:08:00.000Z	craigbass1976	Arwen	I did sudo apt-get install jackd, and type my pass in when it asked.  Everything went
