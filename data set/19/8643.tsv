2011-05-08T18:11:00.000Z	ezra_		can someone help me with a gnome-session error? maybe causing my system to lockup, have the syslog but not sure what it means
2011-05-08T18:12:00.000Z	jrib	ezra_	paste actual error and relevant log in pastebin, otherwise there's no way to possibly help
2011-05-08T18:13:00.000Z	ezra_	jrib	well the actual error is system lockup.. with a few gnome-session CRITICAL and WARNING's http://pastebin.com/pVxgeUiA
2011-05-08T18:18:00.000Z	jrib	ezra_	describe what happens (does it randomly lock up?  And then?  Do you have to hard reboot or can you get to a tty or use magic sysrq keys?)
2011-05-08T18:20:00.000Z	ezra_	jrib	yes randomly locks up, i used to have to cold reboot, but then i discovers the magic sysrq keys so i can safly reboot. Computer is a Lenovo thinkpad T510 btw
2011-05-08T18:21:00.000Z	jrib	ezra_	is there anything relevant in ~/.xsession-errors? or /var/log/Xorg.0.log perhaps?
2011-05-08T18:22:00.000Z	ezra_	jrib	where do i access .xession-errrors?
2011-05-08T18:22:00.000Z	jrib	ezra_	~ means /home/username
2011-05-08T18:22:00.000Z	ezra_	jrib	i dont know about the Xorg log, its not timestampped so.. dunno where to look
2011-05-08T18:25:00.000Z	ezra_	jrib	heres the pastebin of the xsession-error log http://pastebin.com/A5XteJ9v
2011-05-08T18:30:00.000Z	jrib	ezra_	you're not using ubuntu?
2011-05-08T18:31:00.000Z	ezra_	jrib	Technicly not, Running Linux Mint 10. but no one was answering in the Linux Mint channel and this issue happens on most distros.
2011-05-08T18:32:00.000Z	jrib	ezra_	please use the mint channel for support; we're not even sure what "this issue" is exactly...
2011-05-08T18:32:00.000Z	ezra_	jrib	neither is anyone else.
2011-05-08T18:33:00.000Z	jrib	ezra_	ok, but the mint channel is the appropriate channel to ask for help with this
2011-05-08T18:33:00.000Z	ezra_	jrib	well put it this way, i was running ubuntu 11.04 an hour ago and its the same error
2011-05-08T18:34:00.000Z	jrib	ezra_	I can try to help you troubleshoot your ubuntu install if you wish
2011-05-08T18:35:00.000Z	ezra_	jrib	i wiped ubuntu for Mint, couldnt stand Unity :(
2011-05-08T18:35:00.000Z	jrib	ezra_	that's fine
