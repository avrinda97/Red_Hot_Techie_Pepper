2007-07-04T15:50:00.000Z	fourbit_		I have just made the jump to Ubuntu. Found an old install disk for breezy. Installed sweet. But, now, find that it's unsupported. :(
2007-07-04T15:51:00.000Z	fourbit_		Which version should I use?
2007-07-04T15:52:00.000Z	fourbit_		Currently downloading 6.06 . will that be a good install to use for a while?
2007-07-04T15:53:00.000Z	stefg	fourbit_	that depends on your hardware and your usage scenario.... generally newer is better, and there's already  one year of the 3-year LTS-period over for dapper
2007-07-04T15:55:00.000Z	fourbit_	stefg	thank you
2007-07-04T15:56:00.000Z	stefg	fourbit_	what kind of box you got there?
2007-07-04T15:58:00.000Z	fourbit_	stefg	asus a7n8x board.
2007-07-04T15:59:00.000Z	fourbit_	stefg	I use it in my business. Web hosting etc.
2007-07-04T16:00:00.000Z	stefg	fourbit_	oh, so for server use? yeah, should be the right choice. On the desktop side dapper starts to look oldish (firefox 1.5 e.g.)
2007-07-05T16:02:00.000Z	fourbit_	stefg	I use limited server use. only developement.
2007-07-05T16:02:00.000Z	fourbit_	stefg	Looking old is ok. I'm OLD!
2007-07-05T16:03:00.000Z	stefg	fourbit_	given the rapid pace of OSS development i'd prefer feisty (7.04) you won't have fun develoing with outdated libs
2007-07-05T16:04:00.000Z	fourbit_	stefg	is there anyway to update directly? Or, do I have to continue with this download and wait 6 hours to install this in place of the current one?
2007-07-05T16:06:00.000Z	stefg	fourbit_	cancel the download... upgrading is only supported in incremental steps, edgy is a mess and and fresh install will be around 200 - 400 MB smaller than an upgraded install.
2007-07-05T16:07:00.000Z	fourbit_	stefg	I'm downloading the full 'dapper' version, I think.
2007-07-05T16:08:00.000Z	stefg	fourbit_	get the recent version
2007-07-05T16:20:00.000Z	fourbit_	stefg	 I am dl'ng from the ubuntu site. Which release do you want?
2007-07-05T16:21:00.000Z	fourbit_	stefg	doing the ubuntu 6.06. and 13% done.
2007-07-05T16:21:00.000Z	fourbit_	stefg	Well, gotta run. Thanks. email if I misunderstood. nichols@midrivers.com thanks again
