2007-10-11T16:29:00.000Z	Sukoshi	Zhiva	When compiling, set your prefix.
2007-10-11T16:30:00.000Z	Zhiva	Sukoshi	I don't want the compile to go to /usr/bin, I want it in local. But it seems the system still thinks the old binaries are there.
2007-10-11T16:30:00.000Z	Sukoshi	Zhiva	Well ... I guess other packages depend on it being there ....
2007-10-11T16:30:00.000Z	Sukoshi	Zhiva	I don't use Ruby much, but maybe there's an environmental variable here?
2007-10-11T16:31:00.000Z	Zhiva	Sukoshi	it's not a ruby thing, I've experienced it before on other things
2007-10-11T16:31:00.000Z	Sukoshi	Zhiva	I meant as in, I'm not certain what env vars Ruby wants.
2007-10-11T16:32:00.000Z	Sukoshi	Zhiva	A cursory look over http://phrogz.net/ProgrammingRuby/rubyworld.html talks about 3 env vars (LOADPATH, RUBYPATH, and the typical PATH).
2007-10-11T16:32:00.000Z	Zhiva	Sukoshi	the ruby compile and all is fine, the problem seems to be in the path. the system still thinks that /usr/bin/ruby is there, even tho I did an apt-get remove ruby*
2007-10-11T16:32:00.000Z	Zhiva	Sukoshi	as mentioned, I've had this trouble with trivial things like irssi earlier
2007-10-11T16:33:00.000Z	Sukoshi	Zhiva	Check those env vars.
2007-10-11T16:33:00.000Z	Sukoshi	Zhiva	Are you familiar with env vars? (I'm just asking to be pedantic here.)
2007-10-11T16:33:00.000Z	Zhiva	Sukoshi	yes, I am :)
2007-10-11T16:33:00.000Z	Sukoshi	Zhiva	Thought so.
2007-10-11T16:34:00.000Z	Sukoshi	Zhiva	Hmph.
2007-10-11T16:34:00.000Z	Sukoshi	Zhiva	A hackish solution is to create an alias to the ruby interpreter, and that may or may not work ....
2007-10-11T16:35:00.000Z	Sukoshi	Zhiva	Or use aptitude, which works out removing things much better.
2007-10-11T16:35:00.000Z	Zhiva	Sukoshi	yeah, but I seldom have ncurses in
2007-10-11T16:36:00.000Z	Sukoshi	Zhiva	Does aptitude depend on curses?
2007-10-11T16:36:00.000Z	Sukoshi	Zhiva	I've used it as a drop-in replacement for apt-get and it's worked fine for me.
