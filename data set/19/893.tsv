2011-10-15T08:24:00.000Z	JZApples		When upgrading Ubuntu 11.04 to 11.10, I don't need to worry about losing any data or setup, will I?  Software RAID array, Evolution Mail, and my backup configuration are high on the list of concerns.
2011-10-15T08:26:00.000Z	sebsebseb	JZApples	well you might lose evolution as part of the upgrade
2011-10-15T08:26:00.000Z	sebsebseb	JZApples	since Gnome 2 isn't part of Ubuntu 11.10
2011-10-15T08:28:00.000Z	JZApples	sebsebseb	that was what i was worried about.  So it will uninstall evolution and I will lose all that?
2011-10-15T08:29:00.000Z	sebsebseb	JZApples	maybe, but I don't know
2011-10-15T08:29:00.000Z	sebsebseb	JZApples	and your user stuff for evolution will probably be ok
2011-10-15T08:30:00.000Z	JZApples	sebsebseb	i've been thinking of just switching to thunderbird for some time.
2011-10-15T08:30:00.000Z	sebsebseb	JZApples	personaly if I was going ot use a email client I would use Thunderbird or maybe even  the email  client in Seamonkey,  but well never used Evolution as an actsaul email client before so hmm
2011-10-15T08:31:00.000Z	sebsebseb	JZApples	anyway web mail for me for now :)
2011-10-15T08:31:00.000Z	sebsebseb	JZApples	of course there's Kmail as well for example, if you don't mind having KDE apps
2011-10-15T08:31:00.000Z	JZApples	sebsebseb	yeah i used to use web mail and regret setting up evolution.  I had the
2011-10-15T08:32:00.000Z	JZApples	sebsebseb	i had the 'delete mail from server' option checked and it removed everything from the server so i just keep my own backup now.
2011-10-15T08:32:00.000Z	sebsebseb	JZApples	oh ok
2011-10-15T08:32:00.000Z	JZApples	sebsebseb	i'd rather not use kde, gnome works great, wish Ubuntu would have stuck with Gnome 3
2011-10-15T08:33:00.000Z	sebsebseb	JZApples	right, but you can use KDE  apps with Gnome, that's what I mean
2011-10-15T08:33:00.000Z	JZApples	sebsebseb	yeah i know
2011-10-15T08:33:00.000Z	JZApples	sebsebseb	i'm kind of a linux newb so i'm trying to keep it simple for awhile
2011-10-15T08:34:00.000Z	JZApples	sebsebseb	yeah i'm aware of that.  Gnome 3 looks great.  I'm curious to see how Unity works in 11.10 but am hesitant to upgrade right away.
2011-10-15T08:35:00.000Z	sebsebseb	JZApples	it seems according to bazhang that upgrading  from 11.04 to 11.10, that your evolution  emails and such will still be ok. and I did say you probably have the settings for that in home or wheever it saves earlier anyway
