2008-11-04T21:05:00.000Z	wh1t3_UB	`TonY	any reason that should not work here btw? used to work fine in hardy, after upgrade smb:// links give me an error
2008-11-04T21:06:00.000Z	`TonY	wh1t3_UB	have you installed nautilus-share ?
2008-11-04T21:06:00.000Z	`TonY	wh1t3_UB	have you installed nautilus-share package ?
2008-11-04T21:07:00.000Z	wh1t3_UB	`TonY	nautilus-share is already the newest version.
2008-11-04T21:09:00.000Z	wh1t3_UB	`TonY	the nautilus-share package is installed, any other ideas?
2008-11-04T21:10:00.000Z	`TonY	wh1t3_UB	are you using an ip or name in the address ?
2008-11-04T21:10:00.000Z	`TonY	wh1t3_UB	use IP
2008-11-04T21:11:00.000Z	wh1t3_UB	`TonY	IP did work, any particular reason why? and... any way around using IP all the time?
2008-11-04T21:13:00.000Z	`TonY	wh1t3_UB	this is due to name resolving , add search LAN in your /etc/resolv.conf file using sudo
2008-11-04T21:13:00.000Z	`TonY	wh1t3_UB	then try using names after that
2008-11-04T21:13:00.000Z	wh1t3_UB	`TonY	resolv already has search mydomain, is that not enough?
2008-11-04T21:14:00.000Z	`TonY	wh1t3_UB	just add LAN after mydomain , seperated by single space
2008-11-04T21:15:00.000Z	wh1t3_UB	`TonY	Yep, that did the trick, great :) Cheers man!
2008-11-04T21:15:00.000Z	`TonY	wh1t3_UB	most welcome
2008-11-04T21:16:00.000Z	`TonY	wh1t3_UB	nmap is in network tools, port scanner
2008-11-04T21:17:00.000Z	wh1t3_UB	`TonY	i dont even have network tools
2008-11-04T21:18:00.000Z	`TonY	wh1t3_UB	in system menu -> administration
2008-11-04T21:19:00.000Z	wh1t3_UB	`TonY	ah, didnt realise that uses nmap, but still there does not seem to be a way to change any settings (and id rather use it with cli tbh)
2008-11-04T21:19:00.000Z	`TonY	wh1t3_UB	i'd rather too
