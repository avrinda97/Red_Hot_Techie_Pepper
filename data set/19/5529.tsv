2008-11-18T07:41:00.000Z	error404notfound		how can I completely remove gnome? I tried apt-get autoremove ubuntu-desktop gnome gnome-core, but there are still atleast 90 appliation gnome-* which are installed...
2008-11-18T07:43:00.000Z	Dr_willis	error404notfound	 you could just not start the kdm/gdm service...
2008-11-18T07:43:00.000Z	error404notfound	Dr_willis	yes, that's what I did 2 hours ago, but they are still consuming space....
2008-11-18T07:44:00.000Z	Dr_willis	error404notfound	  fire up the package manger and start removing stuff I guess...
2008-11-18T07:45:00.000Z	error404notfound	Dr_willis	excuse me.... I am not into any UI, and using aptitude's ui would be headache, autoremove should have removed them, shouldn't it?
2008-11-18T07:45:00.000Z	Dr_willis	error404notfound	 most likely not.. depoedns on how they got installed.
2008-11-18T07:45:00.000Z	error404notfound	Dr_willis	did a fresh intrepid installl
2008-11-18T07:46:00.000Z	Dr_willis	error404notfound	 and what exactly did you do to try to remove them?
2008-11-18T07:46:00.000Z	error404notfound	Dr_willis	as said before apt-get autoremove ubuntu-desktop which is also the way recommend on the link bazhang gave
2008-11-18T07:47:00.000Z	Dr_willis	error404notfound	 from what i recall thats just a meta-package.. if it had been installed with appitude, then aptitude  remove  ubuntu-desktop  might of gotten rid of it.. but ive never really tried.. Just heard of others trying to clean the stuff out, and failing
2008-11-18T07:48:00.000Z	Dr_willis	error404notfound	 thats an issue  with using meta-packages I guess.
2008-11-18T07:48:00.000Z	error404notfound	Dr_willis	yes, it's a meta package, but the way to uninstall it is recommended on ubuntu community docs...
