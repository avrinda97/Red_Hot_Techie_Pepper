2009-01-09T18:13:00.000Z	gogereaver	ikonia	look at eve linux
2009-01-09T18:13:00.000Z	ikonia	gogereaver	running quite well is not running on native platform,.
2009-01-09T18:13:00.000Z	gogereaver	ikonia	it uses it won version of cedega
2009-01-09T18:13:00.000Z	ikonia	gogereaver	running a game on the native platform will always be the best option
2009-01-09T18:14:00.000Z	gogereaver	ikonia	eve linux aculy runs better then eve windows
2009-01-09T18:14:00.000Z	gogereaver	ikonia	eve online uses ther own version of cedega
2009-01-09T18:16:00.000Z	gogereaver	ikonia	it just depends on the game on some bechmark games run better other worse
2009-01-09T18:16:00.000Z	gogereaver	ikonia	mostly due to linux having less overhead then lets say vista
2009-01-09T18:16:00.000Z	ikonia	gogereaver	I would doubt very much that any native windows platform game will run better through an abstraction layer on an different OS than it would on the correct native OS
