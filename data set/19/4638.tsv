2008-12-01T06:18:00.000Z	cheesebender		can anyone tell me how to set my system time to utc?
2008-12-01T06:19:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	cheesebender	the internal clock should already be UTC. what application do you want to change? gnome?
2008-12-01T06:20:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	cheesebender	the TZ variable controls the displayed timezone. so  "TZ= date"  shows UTC for example
2008-12-01T06:21:00.000Z	cheesebender	zsquareplusc	where would i set that?
2008-12-01T06:24:00.000Z	cheesebender	zsquareplusc	i just dont want anyone knowing what my timezone is
2008-12-01T06:25:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	cheesebender	when starting programms on the command line prefix with TZ=  not sure in which file you can set it for your user and all apps
2008-12-01T06:27:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	cheesebender	try that once on a terminal "TZ= date" and then hust "date"
2008-12-01T06:27:00.000Z	cheesebender	zsquareplusc	i dont want to screw up my computer
2008-12-01T06:29:00.000Z	cheesebender	zsquareplusc	do you know what you're talking about ?
2008-12-01T06:30:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	cheesebender	there are environment variables that contol program behavior for example LANG sets the language and TZ the timezone. so you have to set the envirionmet variable TZ to empty and the app you run will display UTC
2008-12-01T06:31:00.000Z	cheesebender	zsquareplusc	is that better than GMT?
2008-12-01T06:32:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	cheesebender	dont know if GMT also display what you want, it wont matter
2008-12-01T06:33:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	cheesebender	GMT is just an other name for UTC
2008-12-01T06:34:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	cheesebender	huh? you want that apps display UTC, so set TZ=UTC and they will
2008-12-01T06:34:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	cheesebender	bu why hide timezone as its so easy to get an IP to country mapping ;-)
2008-12-01T06:37:00.000Z	cheesebender	zsquareplusc	where do i put tz=utc in a program launcher
2008-12-01T06:39:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	cheesebender	good question...  "env TZ=UTC application" should work
2008-12-01T06:40:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	cheesebender	you were asking about application starters... edit the preferences of them..
2008-12-01T06:45:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	cheesebender	we had that already.. "TZ=UTC app"
