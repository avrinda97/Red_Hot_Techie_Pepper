2008-07-07T21:43:00.000Z	Xavura		How do I get it so I don't have to re-enter my DNS settings every time I start Ubuntu
2008-07-07T21:43:00.000Z	Xavura		It's kind of annoying
2008-07-07T21:45:00.000Z	Pici	Xavura	Because your router is giving you other dns servers? You can add a line to your /etc/dhcp3/dhclient.conf   with the following:  prepend domain-name-servers xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx xx.xxx.xx.xx;
2008-07-07T21:46:00.000Z	Xavura	Pici	then I won't have to go to network settings > then unlock it then edit the dns servers it chose?
2008-07-07T21:46:00.000Z	Pici	Xavura	indeed, it should fix that
2008-07-07T21:47:00.000Z	Xavura	Pici	so I add that to the very end?
2008-07-11T18:07:00.000Z	Pici	Xavura	you can modify compiz's settings for opacity, but #compiz-fusion would be the right place to speicifcally ask about that
2008-08-27T17:26:00.000Z	Pici	Xavura	scientus: Either you have libflashsupport installed, and flash is crashy or you remove it and have issues with sound.
2008-08-27T17:26:00.000Z	Xavura	Pici	Come again?
2008-08-27T17:26:00.000Z	Pici	Xavura	Do you have the libflashsupport package installed?
2008-08-27T17:27:00.000Z	Pici	Xavura	apt-cache policy libflashsupport
2008-08-27T17:27:00.000Z	Xavura	Pici	http://pastie.org/260890
2008-08-27T17:28:00.000Z	Pici	Xavura	Heres the deal: If you remove that package, the crashing will probably stop, but you may have issues with concurrent sounds
2008-08-27T17:29:00.000Z	Xavura	Pici	With sounds for Flash, or with sounds in general?
2008-08-27T17:29:00.000Z	Pici	Xavura	Sounds for flash
2008-08-27T17:29:00.000Z	Pici	Xavura	Because Adobe can't make a version of Flash that works with modern sound processing.
2008-08-27T17:30:00.000Z	Pici	Xavura	They aren't then.
2008-08-27T17:30:00.000Z	Pici	Xavura	Windows isn't linux.
2008-08-27T17:30:00.000Z	Pici	Xavura	I'm talking about Linux, that should be a given.
