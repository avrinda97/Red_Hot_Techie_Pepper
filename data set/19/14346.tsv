2004-10-25T08:55:00.000Z	AndyFitz		ubuntu = humanity .. wallpaper/artwork = humans.  A tasteful and very mature concept too
2004-10-25T08:55:00.000Z	AndyFitz		not true.  its ubuntu's close link with humanity that sets it apart
2004-10-25T08:57:00.000Z	AndyFitz		people will criticize. and cultures have different ideals. but being impersonal wont drive the philosophy home.   no doubt people would be e-mailing saying " why arent they wearing glasses "  if all the artwork were just heads hots
2004-10-25T08:58:00.000Z	AndyFitz		heads hots = headshots :-P
2004-10-25T08:58:00.000Z	mxpxpod	AndyFitz	good point :)
2004-10-25T09:02:00.000Z	AndyFitz	mxpxpod	i love the idea of no root
2005-04-14T08:40:00.000Z	AndyFitz	mxpxpod	 its because it looks like the icon names have just changed
2005-04-14T08:41:00.000Z	mxpxpod	AndyFitz	where can I find that out? (it looks like it's just a ppc issue... my brother's freshly installed ubuntu on i386 works fine)
2005-04-14T08:41:00.000Z	mxpxpod	AndyFitz	of course on both counts
2005-04-14T08:42:00.000Z	mxpxpod	AndyFitz	ok, they might not have come over to ppc yet
2005-04-14T08:42:00.000Z	AndyFitz	mxpxpod	 yeah most likely..  its shouldnt be long
2005-04-14T08:42:00.000Z	mxpxpod	AndyFitz	oh, did they scrap the polypaudio thing for hoary?
2005-04-14T08:44:00.000Z	AndyFitz	mxpxpod	 I have no idea, sorry
2005-04-14T08:44:00.000Z	mxpxpod	AndyFitz	that's ok
2005-04-14T08:45:00.000Z	mxpxpod	AndyFitz	thanks for the other answers
2005-04-14T08:46:00.000Z	AndyFitz	mxpxpod	all good...hey  your nick is familiar..  is it an ID software cheat code perhaps ?
2005-04-14T08:46:00.000Z	mxpxpod	AndyFitz	heh, no
2005-04-14T08:47:00.000Z	mxpxpod	AndyFitz	I guess they did scrap polypaudio... I wonder why
