2006-01-11T06:05:00.000Z	Morg		I'm not sure I get why they can't update Firefox.
2006-01-11T06:06:00.000Z	mwe	Morg	because stuff that depends on gecko will break
2006-01-11T06:06:00.000Z	mwe	Morg	that's like 50 things or more
2006-01-11T06:07:00.000Z	Morg	mwe	So if I can install it myself in a new directory, why don't they make a new package that does the same thing, but integrates with the other things I've installed?
2006-01-11T06:08:00.000Z	mwe	Morg	like I told you it would break too much stuff
2006-01-11T06:08:00.000Z	Morg	mwe	I guess you didn't read my statement.
2006-01-11T06:08:00.000Z	mwe	Morg	read http://distrowatch.com/weekly.php?issue=20051212#3 for reference. you installing it yourself keeps the old one around for stuff that needs the old gecko
2006-01-11T06:09:00.000Z	Morg	mwe	Precisely, so why can't they make a package that does the equivalent of what installing it yourself does?
2006-01-11T06:09:00.000Z	mwe	Morg	they could. but that would mean having two versions of firefox around
2006-01-11T06:09:00.000Z	Morg	mwe	And why can't they do that?
2006-01-11T06:10:00.000Z	mwe	Morg	I guess they could. I don't know why they wont. maybe they think it's a mess
2006-01-11T06:10:00.000Z	Morg	mwe	Seems like they already made a mess if they can't install new versions of a web browser.
2006-01-11T06:11:00.000Z	mwe	Morg	no wrong
2006-01-11T06:11:00.000Z	Morg	mwe	How so?
2006-01-11T06:11:00.000Z	mwe	Morg	firefox developers should start thinking and not change the api all the time
2006-01-11T06:12:00.000Z	mwe	Morg	making it independent of other apps would mean not installing anything the depends on gecko
2006-01-11T06:12:00.000Z	mwe	Morg	that includes the help browser and other stuff
2006-01-11T06:13:00.000Z	Morg	mwe	If Ubuntu set up any of their software so that it was dependent on Firefox, then I'd say Ubuntu already made a mess.
2006-01-11T06:15:00.000Z	mwe	Morg	I guess keeping gecko as a seperate package and providing firefox as standalone would solve. file a bug report
