2007-09-12T06:59:00.000Z	Sajes		Let me check what modle I have.
2007-09-12T06:59:00.000Z	Sajes		module*
2007-09-12T07:00:00.000Z	Sajes		Okay. It's an Intel(R) 82845G/GL/GE/PE/GV Graphics controller. :o
2007-09-12T07:00:00.000Z	Sajes		Integrated.
2007-09-12T07:01:00.000Z	Sajes		Yes.
2007-09-12T07:01:00.000Z	Sajes		But after the X server stops it doesn't align with my monitor properly for some reason.
2007-09-12T07:02:00.000Z	Sajes		Where would I do that? :o
2007-09-12T07:03:00.000Z	Sajes		Ah. Thanks. Now I have another question - If I emulate Windows in Linux, will I be able to use my Winmodem to connect in the virtualized Windows, and use that connection in Ubuntu?
2007-09-12T07:04:00.000Z	Sajes		I tried the linuxant drivers for my modem but.. sadly, they must not be compatible with my modem. :o
2007-09-12T07:04:00.000Z	arkanes	Sajes	I would be amazed beyond believe if that worked
2007-09-12T07:05:00.000Z	Sajes		Ah.. So I should just invest in a hardware modem?
2007-09-12T07:05:00.000Z	arkanes		ndiswrapper was originally invented for winmodems, so odds are good
2007-09-12T07:05:00.000Z	arkanes		hardware modems are better for a lot of reasons though, back when it mattered I spent the extra 30 bucks on one and never regretted it
2007-09-12T07:06:00.000Z	Sajes	arkanes	I heard they were better because it uses the actual hardware to do all of the work, unlike winmodems.
2007-09-12T07:06:00.000Z	arkanes	Sajes	thats correct
2007-09-12T07:07:00.000Z	Sajes	arkanes	Cool. Are all external modems hardware modems, or do I still have a chance of getting an external winmodem? That would bite.
2007-09-12T07:07:00.000Z	arkanes	Sajes	I don't really know, it was years ago that I got mine
2007-09-12T07:07:00.000Z	arkanes	Sajes	they're generally labelled as hardware modems if they are, and unlabelled if not
