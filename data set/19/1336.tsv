2011-02-24T01:08:00.000Z	__osh____	iiname	try modprobe or insmod on the files you have. If they are .so files.

2011-02-24T01:14:00.000Z	iiname	__osh____	 on the terminal i am in the directory, and tried the command with file name as insmod WDMInstaller.zip  error: insmod: error inserting 'WDMInstaller.zip': -1 Operation not permitted
2011-02-24T01:16:00.000Z	__osh____	iiname	you can't use insmod on zip-files. only on drivername.so files. Unzip the file. Look inside. Look for the driver and try to insmod that. And I'm not really sure that will work either.
2011-02-24T01:16:00.000Z	__osh____	iiname	are you sure you got linux drivers?
2011-02-24T01:16:00.000Z	iiname	__osh____	 will try
