2006-05-22T11:12:00.000Z	Centaur5		Is there a way to find out what caused my laptop to completely lock up?
2006-05-22T11:13:00.000Z	dli	Centaur5	what is a "complete lock up"?
2006-05-22T11:13:00.000Z	Centaur5	dli	I had to hold the power button til it shut off because nothing at all would work.  I was wondering if maybe something would be in a log file.
2006-05-22T11:14:00.000Z	dli	Centaur5	weird, did you try to network?
2006-05-22T11:14:00.000Z	Centaur5	dli	I was already connected to a network and I had firefox open but it was idle.
2006-05-22T11:14:00.000Z	dli	Centaur5	could be a dead X, or cpu overheating
2006-05-22T11:15:00.000Z	dli	Centaur5	no, can you connect to the machine via network?
2006-05-22T11:15:00.000Z	Centaur5	dli	I have a laptop cooler with 2 fans blowing on it all the time.
2006-05-22T11:15:00.000Z	Centaur5	dli	Oh, it's the only computer I have at home so I can't try that.
2006-05-22T11:16:00.000Z	dli	Centaur5	what were you doing when it happened? standard ubuntu kernel?
2006-05-22T11:16:00.000Z	Centaur5	dli	It did this last night so I would like to see if it's a bug.
2006-05-22T11:16:00.000Z	Centaur5	dli	I was listening to music with xmms, had gaim open but idle, firefox open but idle, and one terminal open
2006-05-22T11:17:00.000Z	Centaur5	dli	Updates were installing and now I can't open the update manager (it installed all but 4)
2006-05-22T11:17:00.000Z	dli	Centaur5	sounds okay, stable breezy?
2006-05-22T11:17:00.000Z	Centaur5	dli	Dapper
2006-05-22T11:18:00.000Z	Centaur5	dli	Standard smp kernel
2006-05-22T11:18:00.000Z	dli	Centaur5	then, check for hardware problem (memtest86), but still go #ubuntu+1
2006-05-22T11:19:00.000Z	Centaur5	dli	Alright, nothing would be in a log though?
2006-05-22T11:20:00.000Z	dli	Centaur5	run memtest86 first
