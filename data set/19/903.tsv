2011-07-24T07:26:00.000Z	pfifo	HavokD	what is the desired outcome, and what are acceptable outvcomes?
2011-07-24T07:30:00.000Z	pfifo	HavokD	Im pretty sure the odl GPU couldeasilly be used with the intel drivers that come stock on linux at 1366*768, the better card of course has hardware accelration, which is what you need if you want ot ply black ops 2 on linus, but hey, black ops 2 wasnt ported to linux by the developer, I dont even thing blackops 1 was ported, or MW2 or COD4 or even sim city 2000
2011-07-24T07:30:00.000Z	HavokD	pfifo	wut?
2011-07-24T07:31:00.000Z	pfifo	HavokD	do you NEED hardware accelration in linux?
2011-07-24T07:34:00.000Z	pfifo	HavokD	so what exactly are you trying todo with the superior graphics card that the lesser graphic cannot do?
2011-07-24T07:34:00.000Z	HavokD	pfifo	get it working
2011-07-24T07:35:00.000Z	pfifo	HavokD	for what purpose?
2011-07-24T07:38:00.000Z	HavokD	pfifo	Tigerboy i restarted my computer after choosing this no-screen no device option - i've been dropped to a command line on boot, startx says there are no screens found
2011-07-24T07:38:00.000Z	pfifo	HavokD	yes it does, greatly. You old video card is 100% supported and works flawlessly with your needs so far, there is nothing it cannot do that you couls want todo with with linux. It works great in Windows you said, and of course games are made for windows, which leaves a big blak spot followed by a question mark for your intention. If your whole intention is to get a non working piece of hardware to function properly in linux then #kernel
2011-07-24T07:40:00.000Z	HavokD	pfifo	i wish to use it for calculations, GPU's are great for that
2011-07-24T07:40:00.000Z	pfifo	HavokD	what kind of calculations? sha256?
2011-07-24T07:41:00.000Z	pfifo	HavokD	last i checked OpenCL dosent cre what card is runing your display or what resolution your display is at
2011-07-24T07:42:00.000Z	HavokD	pfifo	i'm guessing your thinking of bitcoin mining, no never, what a stupid waist of resources that is
2011-07-24T07:42:00.000Z	pfifo	HavokD	are you looking for a one line fix all fr getting gigahashes on your bitcoin miner?
2011-07-24T07:44:00.000Z	HavokD	pfifo	i simply want my hardware to work, and to be able to use it, most it'll get used for is oblivion
2011-07-24T07:44:00.000Z	pfifo	HavokD	well lucky for you the develpoers of the HD intel linux drive do not, but it not ready and not included in 2.6.32.32, you HAVE to use the old card with 2D for now.
2011-07-24T07:45:00.000Z	pfifo	HavokD	Oblivion a linux only game?
2011-07-24T07:46:00.000Z	HavokD	pfifo	i thought something of you earlier today, but now i don't want to feed the trolls
2011-07-24T07:48:00.000Z	HavokD	pfifo	its not its a radeon 4500M
