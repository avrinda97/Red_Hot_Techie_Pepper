2012-09-20T20:30:00.000Z	PatrickC	Sidewinder1	never done that before when installing ubuntu, as there has always been an "Install alongside windows" option that i used
2012-09-20T20:34:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	PatrickC	The drfrag is done from/within the win OS; you may wish to resize it (the NTFS partition) also, from within the win OS. I've never resized from within win, but have read many times that that is the preferred method.
2012-09-20T20:35:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	PatrickC	Just stay as far from WUBI as you can; WADR to the developers. of course.
2012-09-20T20:35:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	PatrickC	With All Due Respect.
2012-09-20T20:37:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	PatrickC	Here is a GREAT resource, if you've not already seen it: http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/index
2012-09-20T20:38:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	PatrickC	It's written and maintained by an ubuntuforums.org, moderator.
2012-09-20T20:38:00.000Z	PatrickC	Sidewinder1	their instructions to do windows and ubuntu... WUBI -___-
2012-09-20T20:40:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	PatrickC	Yes, he is rather confusing regarding WUBI; you need to read his entire site to fully understand his rationale, but, I don't particularly agree with him; at least on that point.
2012-09-20T20:42:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	PatrickC	That screenshot may be from a previous version of ubuntu.
2012-09-20T20:44:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	PatrickC	Are you familiar with http://ubuntuforums.org?
2012-09-20T20:44:00.000Z	PatrickC	Sidewinder1	not really
2012-09-20T20:45:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	PatrickC	It, also is a fantastic resource; especially the 'search' function.
2012-09-20T20:46:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	PatrickC	But, obviously not as quick as here, on IRC..
2012-09-20T20:47:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	PatrickC	I strongly suggest that you register {it's free} :-) there and avail yourself of all that it has to offer.
2012-09-20T20:47:00.000Z	PatrickC	Sidewinder1	i'll register there.. and wait for my friend who is on the ubuntu dev team to return to his computer ;)
2012-09-20T20:49:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	PatrickC	There are some very nice/knowledgeable folks there; then there's me.. ;-)
2012-09-20T20:54:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	PatrickC	As you're probably aware, server is CLI; has no desktop/GUI, unless you add one..
2012-09-20T20:54:00.000Z	PatrickC	Sidewinder1	i would install something like cinnamon
