2008-03-22T07:23:00.000Z	dthacker		Hi.  One of our loco members has not worked with his machine for awhile.  He has lost his password. Now he gets a login prompt of "Nobody" and can't login.  How can he reset the password?
2008-03-22T07:24:00.000Z	xtknight	dthacker	he can go into single-user(Recovery Mode) and type "passwd username" to get a prompt to reset "username"'s password
2008-03-22T07:24:00.000Z	xtknight	dthacker	recovery mode appears at the GRUB start.  standard boot
2008-03-22T07:25:00.000Z	xtknight	dthacker	sometimes you need to press ESC at bootup to show the grub menu.  Recovery Mode is there.
2008-03-22T07:34:00.000Z	dthacker	xtknight	can you useradd from recovery mode?
2008-03-22T07:35:00.000Z	xtknight	dthacker	why, did "passwd username" not work for changing username's password
2008-03-22T07:35:00.000Z	xtknight	dthacker	you just need to change a passowrd right?  but ya useradd works
2008-03-22T07:36:00.000Z	dthacker	xtknight	I'm not sure if he remembers his username, so I thought I might have him add one.  thanks
2008-03-22T07:36:00.000Z	xtknight	dthacker	oh.  you can list usernames
2008-03-22T07:37:00.000Z	xtknight	dthacker	just type "cat /etc/passwd"
2008-03-22T07:37:00.000Z	xtknight	dthacker	and you will probably recognize a username somewhere in there
2008-03-22T07:37:00.000Z	xtknight	dthacker	follow Fryguy-- 's suggestion "grep bash /etc/passwd" it will list any worthwihle users
2008-03-22T07:38:00.000Z	dthacker	xtknight	ok, will do
2008-03-22T07:43:00.000Z	dthacker	xtknight	this user has "noboby" in his login prompt, and he says it won't clear out.  Suggestions?
2008-03-22T07:43:00.000Z	xtknight	dthacker	hmm that's odd.  ive never seen that before.  this is at gdm?
2008-03-22T07:44:00.000Z	xtknight	dthacker	he can press ctrl alt backspace
2008-03-22T07:44:00.000Z	dthacker	xtknight	will it auto restart?
2008-03-22T07:44:00.000Z	xtknight	dthacker	it just restarts the gnome program
2008-03-22T07:45:00.000Z	xtknight	dthacker	ya
