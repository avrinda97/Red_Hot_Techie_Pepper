2006-11-11T15:37:00.000Z	LjL	Clin1	you need to read about iptables
2006-11-11T15:40:00.000Z	LjL	Clin1	i could give you a ready-made recipe possibly (though it's not the best idea, you should really read before trying this sort of thing), but now right now, i'm in a hurry. ping me next time you see me here perhaps
2006-11-12T09:27:00.000Z	LjL	Clin1	enable universe
2006-11-12T09:27:00.000Z	LjL	Clin1	yes.
2006-11-12T09:29:00.000Z	LjL	Clin1	yes, enabled Universe.
2006-11-12T09:32:00.000Z	LjL	Clin1	perhaps. i don't know what's on your last 8 lines - the website does mention that using the GUI is the recommended method anyway
2006-11-12T09:32:00.000Z	LjL	Clin1	at any rate, if you have enabled it succesfully, type "sudo apt-get update", and then you should be able to install it
2006-11-12T09:36:00.000Z	LjL	Clin1	and no, you need to enable it for "dapper" and "dapper-updates", not just for "dapper-security"
2006-11-17T09:52:00.000Z	LjL	Clin1	*one*? no, not really.
2006-11-18T11:38:00.000Z	LjL	Clin1	?
2006-11-18T11:41:00.000Z	LjL	Clin1	what goes on in your private queries is not really #ubuntu's business
