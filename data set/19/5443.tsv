2009-01-25T06:19:00.000Z	eljaco		can anyone help me figure out what is wrong with my X server? it starts up, but I can't use my mouse or keyboard
2009-01-25T06:20:00.000Z	dean	eljaco	can you try upgrading
2009-01-25T06:20:00.000Z	eljaco	dean	upgrading to what? do you mean apt-get upgrade?
2009-01-25T06:20:00.000Z	dean	eljaco	yes
2009-01-25T06:21:00.000Z	eljaco	dean	well, I just installed a new wireless card, so I don't have a connection
2009-01-25T06:21:00.000Z	eljaco	dean	it says there is nothing upgradable when I run apt-get upgrade
2009-01-25T06:23:00.000Z	dean	eljaco	the keyboard and the mouse don't work or is it just the mouse
2009-01-25T06:23:00.000Z	eljaco	dean	both keyboard and mouse - but I can hit ctrl+alt+F1 and go to the terminal session
2009-01-25T06:24:00.000Z	eljaco	dean	aside from switching sessions, I can't do anything else
2009-01-25T06:25:00.000Z	eljaco	dean	in case it's related, I get a "User Switcher" error when I start X, although when I start normally (not in recovery mode) I can't even type anything in the login screen
2009-01-25T06:26:00.000Z	eljaco	dean	haha - ok, is there a way I can check that?
2009-01-25T06:26:00.000Z	dean	eljaco	sudo update-rc.d -f gdm remove && sudo update-rc.d gdm defaults 99 01
2009-01-25T06:27:00.000Z	dean	eljaco	well you could restart gdm through ssh
2009-01-25T06:27:00.000Z	dean	eljaco	by doing /etc/init.d/gdm restart
2009-01-25T06:27:00.000Z	dean	eljaco	i think it needs sudo
2009-01-25T06:27:00.000Z	eljaco	dean	i did that, but i still can't type anything or move the mouse
2009-01-25T06:28:00.000Z	eljaco	dean	the cursor is blinking though, so I assume it's not frozen
2009-01-25T06:28:00.000Z	dean	eljaco	is it a USB or ps2 mouse and what kind of mouse is it
2009-01-25T06:28:00.000Z	dean	eljaco	this bug might be related https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xserver-xorg-video-openchrome/+bug/274340
