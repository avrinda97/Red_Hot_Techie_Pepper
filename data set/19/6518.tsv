2011-09-26T19:49:00.000Z	helpme	ActionParsnip	I thnk i need to fully re-install grub because one the steps i attempted did get grub to work, just no cfg, it was a ubuntu live cd version of the help
2011-09-26T19:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	helpme	then chroot and run:  grub-install /dev/drive; sudo update-grub     obviously change drive to the actual drive name (sda is common)

2011-09-26T19:54:00.000Z	helpme	ActionParsnip	ahh man....one of the threads must have changed something, now the linux partition isnt eveing showin up
2011-09-26T19:55:00.000Z	helpme	ActionParsnip	itll prob be easier to just re-install from scratch? all the tweaks i can do easily, files can be temp moved to the win partition
2011-09-26T19:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	helpme	makes sense, I'd move them back one at a time and test in case there are issues
2011-09-26T19:56:00.000Z	helpme	ActionParsnip	wasnt there an easy way to fix/install grub from a program that does it almost automatically?
2011-09-26T19:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	helpme	the only way I know is to use a chroot
