2007-01-21T10:20:00.000Z	n2diy	HymnToLife	welcome to the party, that is what we thought about apt-get, but it isn't installed.
2007-01-21T10:21:00.000Z	HymnToLife	n2diy	it obviously is, since which apt-get returned somrthing
2007-01-21T10:23:00.000Z	n2diy	HymnToLife	, alyssa_  I was going on this info. <sasuun> Package `apt-get' is not installed and no info is available.
2007-01-21T10:23:00.000Z	HymnToLife	n2diy	apt-get is not a package in itself

2007-01-23T16:39:00.000Z	HymnToLife	n2diy	you need to use the WAN IP (the one you get from your ISP)
2007-01-23T16:40:00.000Z	n2diy	HymnToLife	Ok, I'll give it a try.
