2006-10-06T15:20:00.000Z	david83		Draco do you got a onboard or hardware network card?
2006-10-06T15:20:00.000Z	Draco	david83	its onboard, MSI mbd
2006-10-06T15:22:00.000Z	Draco	david83	physical network is fine if I plug the laptop in the same network point with the same configuration everything is fine
2006-10-06T15:22:00.000Z	Draco	david83	data is received according to support tab but 0 bytes sent
2006-10-06T15:23:00.000Z	Draco	david83	I can ping the IP address assigned to the card via network tools
2006-10-06T15:23:00.000Z	Draco	david83	no only 1 oboard
2006-10-06T15:24:00.000Z	Draco	david83	first time installation on this machine
2006-10-06T15:25:00.000Z	david83	Draco	maybe try knoppix and if the network works write down the used driver
2006-10-06T15:25:00.000Z	Draco	david83	knoppix ?
2006-10-06T15:27:00.000Z	Draco	david83	thanks for the help anyways going to install windows to test the card
2006-10-06T15:29:00.000Z	Draco	david83	I have 23 other MSI workstations running on the network with Ubuntu never had this problem before so I just need to identify if its hardware related
2006-10-06T15:30:00.000Z	Draco	david83	K9NGM2-FID
2006-10-06T15:30:00.000Z	Draco	david83	first time with K9N motherboard so it may not be supported in Ubuntu, board is 2 days old
2006-10-06T15:32:00.000Z	Draco	david83	ok gonna install windows quick to see if card works there
2006-10-06T15:32:00.000Z	david83	Draco	good luck
