2010-02-28T20:26:00.000Z	xxthink		I use ubuntu 9.10 to access a ntfs diskpartion where the windows xp is installed
2010-02-28T20:27:00.000Z	xxthink		I modified somefiles, for example, a.c, in ubuntu and then I sleep my ubuntu
2010-02-28T20:27:00.000Z	xxthink		Then I re-modified the same files in windows xp
2010-02-28T20:27:00.000Z	xxthink		Then I wakeup my ubuntu
2010-02-28T20:28:00.000Z	xxthink		the a.c file now can't be accessed both in ubuntu and windows xp
2010-02-28T20:28:00.000Z	xxthink		even I use ls command in ubuntu
2010-02-28T20:28:00.000Z	xxthink		It prompts : i/o error
2010-02-28T20:28:00.000Z	oskar-	xxthink	 you destroyed your file system
2010-02-28T20:28:00.000Z	xxthink	oskar-	is there some method than can save my work?
2010-02-28T20:29:00.000Z	xxthink		what can i do?
2010-02-28T20:29:00.000Z	xxthink		I reboot many times
2010-02-28T20:30:00.000Z	xxthink		it doesn't work
2010-02-28T20:30:00.000Z	xxthink		these files can't accessed now
2010-02-28T20:30:00.000Z	xxthink		although I can see there names
2010-02-28T20:30:00.000Z	xxthink		yes
2010-02-28T20:31:00.000Z	oskar-	xxthink	 you may never mount an already opened filesystem a second time and then additionally return using it in the first system. you should try fsck or the windows thing, or "photorec" or similar software to recover the file
2010-02-28T20:31:00.000Z	xxthink		photorec?
2010-02-28T20:32:00.000Z	oskar-	xxthink	 yes. it may help. there is also a free tool from convar, and maybe many more
