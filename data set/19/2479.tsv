2010-03-25T17:29:00.000Z	Knofensa	abhi_nav	WhiteDawn I'm really sorry..but I still can't get it to work :( My problem is, that I need to move a file from here to my windows system32, but whenever I do that over the normal filesystem browser, It tells me that I don't have permission to write on that /dev/sdb/
2010-03-25T17:30:00.000Z	abhi_nav	Knofensa	change permissions using chown and chmod (dont know much)
