2011-08-19T17:53:00.000Z	Logos01		Greetings.
2011-08-19T17:53:00.000Z	Logos01		After a reboot my audio device is no longer being detected. No kernel updates, no major updates of any kind.
2011-08-19T17:53:00.000Z	Logos01		It is now persisting across three updates.
2011-08-19T17:53:00.000Z	Logos01		Running Ubuntu 11.04 amd64 on an hpdv7t-1000
2011-08-19T17:53:00.000Z	escott	Logos01	hot or cold reboots
2011-08-19T17:54:00.000Z	escott	Logos01	do you know what kind of driver it is? you could try and modprobe it directly
2011-08-19T17:56:00.000Z	escott	Logos01	hda is actually a bit broad. you need snd_hda_intel and maybe a snd_hda_codec_???? for the ich9. im not sure what that would be
2011-08-19T17:57:00.000Z	escott	Logos01	it might be snd_hda_codec_realtek try that one
2011-08-19T17:59:00.000Z	Logos01	escott	Here's my modprobe -l | grep -i hda outpud: http://pastebin.com/2EqEUc3X
2011-08-19T18:02:00.000Z	escott	Logos01	i guess lspci -v shows the device but the kernel module doesn't appear beneath it

2011-08-19T18:11:00.000Z	escott	Logos01	have you tried to rmmod, modprobe the snd_hda_intel maybe udev didnt pick up the insertion
2011-08-19T18:11:00.000Z	Logos01	escott	I've rebooted like six times.
2011-08-19T18:13:00.000Z	escott	Logos01	the module seems to be associated with the device so it seems the problem must be with the creation of the device file
2011-08-19T18:13:00.000Z	Logos01	escott	Heh. Either way I just rmmodded ... and it said it wasn't loaded.
2011-08-19T18:16:00.000Z	Logos01	escott	Again, thank you sir.
2012-06-17T23:58:00.000Z	escott	Logos01	but he needs a session manager as well. mputtr needs to make some kind of reference to an Xsession.d session
2012-06-17T23:59:00.000Z	Logos01	escott	Grow up.
2012-06-17T23:59:00.000Z	escott	Logos01	these are the rules of the channel. if you dont want to follow them please leave
