2007-09-09T14:14:00.000Z	Yuzzy		is it normal that Xubuntu runs slower than XP on my AMD 550 mhz ?
2007-09-09T14:16:00.000Z	Yuzzy		Is Xubuntu supposed to be slwer than XP?
2007-09-09T14:16:00.000Z	scguy318	Yuzzy	no, how much mem do you have?
2007-09-09T14:19:00.000Z	scguy318	Yuzzy	more than enough for Xubuntu, im using a crappy 700 Mhz lappy with that much mem
2007-09-09T14:19:00.000Z	scguy318	Yuzzy	what difficulties are you experiencing?
2007-09-09T14:20:00.000Z	scguy318	Yuzzy	if you run top in Terminal, any processes that are significatly taking CPU time?
2007-09-09T14:21:00.000Z	scguy318	Yuzzy	open the Terminal, type top, Enter, what processes are taking up most CPU/mem?
2007-09-09T14:23:00.000Z	scguy318	Yuzzy	-> Applications -> Accessories -> Terminal
2007-09-09T14:24:00.000Z	scguy318	Yuzzy	the process name, and what value?
2007-09-09T14:24:00.000Z	scguy318	Yuzzy	though it sounds like Xorg to me
2007-09-09T14:25:00.000Z	scguy318	Yuzzy	if you shut down gaim, any better?
2007-09-09T14:25:00.000Z	scguy318	Yuzzy	and is Firefox open

2007-10-21T06:01:00.000Z	scguy318	Yuzzy	have you done integrity check on the CD?
2007-10-21T06:02:00.000Z	scguy318	Yuzzy	not memtest, CD integrity test
2007-10-21T06:03:00.000Z	scguy318	Yuzzy	perhaps you should check the MD5 of the ISO, and perhaps reburn
2007-10-21T06:04:00.000Z	scguy318	Yuzzy	is it the old /bin/sh tty job control issue? probably boot with all_generic_ide in that case, otherwise
2007-10-21T06:04:00.000Z	scguy318	Yuzzy	you could try the alternate issue
