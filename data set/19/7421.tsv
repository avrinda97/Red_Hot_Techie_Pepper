2008-09-07T07:48:00.000Z	Ziroday	Xime	you may want to read on how to ask a good question on irc, posting links is usually not a good idea
2008-09-07T07:48:00.000Z	Ziroday	Xime	did you try the alternate cd and what does the busybox shell say?
2008-09-07T07:49:00.000Z	Ziroday	Xime	okay, please address .Did you try the alternate cd?
2008-09-07T07:50:00.000Z	Ziroday	Xime	well try the alternate cd like recommended to you
2008-09-07T07:51:00.000Z	Ziroday	Xime	please address, can you please try the alternative installer
2008-09-07T07:52:00.000Z	Ziroday	Xime	yes, but something in your computer may be incompatible with the graphical installer. Please try the alternate cd
2008-09-07T07:53:00.000Z	Ziroday	Xime	I could try and diagnose your issue farther, but with no error messages and sparse computer information its very difficult
2008-09-07T07:53:00.000Z	Ziroday	Xime	no I am not
2008-09-07T07:55:00.000Z	Ziroday	Xime	I am going to need something better then that sorry
2008-09-07T07:57:00.000Z	Ziroday	Xime	unless knowing the full error message, we cannot tell.
