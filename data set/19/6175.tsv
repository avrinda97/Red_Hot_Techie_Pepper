2009-06-05T18:38:00.000Z	[T]ank		im having some trouble with dns on a machine... I can ping ips, but not names... I have the resolv.conf pointed at my router which all of the windows machines are pointed at as well. The windows machines resolve just fine. Its just my ubuntu box. What else besides resolv.conf can I check?
2009-06-05T18:39:00.000Z	rob_p	[T]ank	You have something similar to, "nameserver 192.168.1.1" in your /etc/resolv.conf file?
2009-06-05T18:40:00.000Z	[T]ank	rob_p	yes
2009-06-05T18:40:00.000Z	[T]ank	rob_p	nameserver 192.168.1.1
2009-06-05T18:41:00.000Z	rob_p	[T]ank	So if you type, "dig yahoo.com" it comes back with no IP response?
2009-06-05T18:41:00.000Z	[T]ank	rob_p	Correct
2009-06-05T18:41:00.000Z	[T]ank	rob_p	# ping google.com
2009-06-05T18:43:00.000Z	rob_p	[T]ank	Seems like your resolver is not working right.  Let me google a bit...
2009-06-05T18:45:00.000Z	rob_p	[T]ank	...or 4.2.2.1 which is a public DNS server.
2009-06-05T18:46:00.000Z	rob_p	[T]ank	If you can resolve IPs with that, then it's your router's nameserver configuration.
2009-06-05T18:50:00.000Z	rob_p	[T]ank	Any luck with a different nameserver in there?
2009-06-05T18:51:00.000Z	rob_p	[T]ank	Did you put, "nameserver 4.2.2.1" in your /etc/resolv.conf file?
2009-06-05T18:53:00.000Z	rob_p	[T]ank	Ok.  If that didn't work, then the resolver seems broken.  Either that or your ISP is redirecting DNS queries to their own nameservers.  Perhaps they have a broken nameserver...
2009-06-05T18:54:00.000Z	rob_p	[T]ank	What is your ISP's nameserver IP?  (I just need one of them)
2009-06-05T18:56:00.000Z	rob_p	[T]ank	They still have nameservers that they are (almost) universally obligated to provide to you.  But whatever...
2009-06-05T18:57:00.000Z	rob_p	[T]ank	Have you tried rebooting the CSU/DSU box?
2009-06-05T18:58:00.000Z	rob_p	[T]ank	T1 service *always* comes with an SLA.  I'd contact them and have 'em fix it!
2009-06-05T18:58:00.000Z	rob_p	[T]ank	I know 'cause I used to have a couple of them.
2009-06-05T18:59:00.000Z	rob_p	[T]ank	Anyway, good luck with it.
