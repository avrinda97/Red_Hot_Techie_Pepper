2010-03-17T23:25:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	Resonate	You installed build-essentials?
2010-03-17T23:26:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	Resonate	And are you calling anything at compiletime that isn't in stdio.h?
2010-03-17T23:27:00.000Z	Resonate	KB1JWQ	Yup, installed build-essentials long ago, and I'm not calling any libraries.  Only using pointers, char and int really.
2010-03-17T23:28:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	Resonate	Can you pastebin an example of shellcode?
2010-03-17T23:30:00.000Z	Resonate	KB1JWQ	It's from Shell Coder's Handbook if you know it. http://pastebin.com/5jLpxjM9
2010-03-17T23:31:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	Resonate	Stand by, attempting it here.
2010-03-17T23:32:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	Resonate	Works correctly here.
2010-03-17T23:32:00.000Z	Resonate	KB1JWQ	What compiling options did you use?
2010-03-17T23:33:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	Resonate	None.  gcc shellcode.c, throws a warning about casting from a pointer to an integer of differing size at line 13.
2010-03-17T23:33:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	Resonate	Running the resulting binary completes successfully; you have a hosed gcc maybe?
2010-03-17T23:35:00.000Z	Resonate	KB1JWQ	This is weird. I reinstalled GCC, and it seems to work for that one now, so thanks. There is one more that still seg_faults, if you're not busy?
2010-03-17T23:36:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	Resonate	Sure.
2010-03-17T23:38:00.000Z	Resonate	KB1JWQ	http://pastebin.com/fuBPdfEf
2010-03-17T23:38:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	Resonate	And what does this do?
2010-03-17T23:40:00.000Z	Resonate	KB1JWQ	I just realised how dangerous it would be if I didn't explain it first, especially with that kind of a name. It's designed to guess program offsets between the ESP and the first instruction of the shellcode.
2010-03-17T23:41:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	Resonate	Segfaults on multiple systems; it's a code issue, not a Ubuntu issue.
2010-03-17T23:44:00.000Z	Resonate	KB1JWQ	Thanks, I assume I've forgotten to change an aspect of it before using it, as I doubt the code by itself is at error.
2010-03-17T23:45:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	Resonate	Yeah, it blows up on BSD as well as Linux.
2010-03-17T23:50:00.000Z	Resonate	KB1JWQ	I found the website of the coder SCH got it off initially, and his/her code runs perfectly, but theirs does not. Not quite sure why not, but it's all solved now. Thanks for your help.
