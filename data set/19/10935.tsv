2006-04-25T11:56:00.000Z	romulo		hello, what is the default kernel shipped in dapper flight6?
2006-04-25T11:58:00.000Z	romulo		hmm it should be shipping 2.6.16...no?
2006-04-25T11:58:00.000Z	romulo		that sux
2006-04-25T11:59:00.000Z	romulo		that means i will have to recompile my own kernel.
2006-04-25T11:59:00.000Z	romulo		again
2006-04-25T11:59:00.000Z	romulo		im wondering why 2.6.16 is on debian-amd64 and not in ubuntu, since ubuntu updates fastly
2006-04-25T11:59:00.000Z	romulo		=P
2006-04-25T12:01:00.000Z	romulo		so i will have to compile it by hand like i said.
2006-04-25T12:02:00.000Z	Warbo	romulo	Sure it would not be easier to only recompile the driver? (or am I in way over my head?)
2006-04-25T12:02:00.000Z	romulo	Warbo	i dont know...seens i couldnt get it compiled with headers
2006-04-25T12:04:00.000Z	Warbo	romulo	might not...
2006-04-25T12:04:00.000Z	romulo	Warbo	hmm why not
2006-04-25T12:04:00.000Z	Warbo	romulo	Dunno, just might not
2006-04-25T12:04:00.000Z	romulo	Warbo	i have imported ubuntu kernels on debian before
2006-04-25T12:07:00.000Z	Warbo	romulo	OK, so Debian wasn't dodgy enough?
2006-04-25T12:08:00.000Z	romulo	Warbo	yeah, that time i was missing stuff that was on ubuntu
2006-04-25T12:20:00.000Z	romulo	Warbo	free.
2006-04-25T12:20:00.000Z	romulo	Warbo	the proprietary one is fglrx
2006-04-25T12:20:00.000Z	Warbo	romulo	I know, but I thought the free was ati (I'm using on my dad's new graphics card)
