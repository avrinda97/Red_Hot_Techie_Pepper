2010-01-21T23:38:00.000Z	_2		hello  i have installed ubuntu 9.10   and i need help with networking
2010-01-21T23:38:00.000Z	actionparsnip	_2	ask away
2010-01-21T23:39:00.000Z	actionparsnip	_2	can you ping 8.8.8.8 ?
2010-01-21T23:39:00.000Z	_2	actionparsnip	no.  not from my new ubuntu 9.10 install
2010-01-21T23:40:00.000Z	actionparsnip	_2	can you ping your routers internal ip?
2010-01-21T23:41:00.000Z	_2	actionparsnip	i am sshed into the 192.168.0.1 box and irc'ing from there to you.
2010-01-21T23:41:00.000Z	actionparsnip	_2	if you run: ifconfig.  Can you pastebin the output please
2010-01-21T23:42:00.000Z	_2	actionparsnip	i can't pastebin from the 9.10 box   i would need gpm installed to do that and can't install anything until i get the network fixed
2010-01-21T23:42:00.000Z	actionparsnip	_2	output the text to a file. Then copy to a web active system
2010-01-21T23:42:00.000Z	_2	actionparsnip	i might redirrect it to a file and scp it to the gateway then post it.
2010-01-21T23:43:00.000Z	actionparsnip	_2	think outside the box
2010-01-21T23:47:00.000Z	actionparsnip	_2	Trek: are the metrics meant to be all zero?
2010-01-21T23:48:00.000Z	_2	actionparsnip	</shrugs>
2010-01-21T23:50:00.000Z	actionparsnip	_2	i'd look into the metric bit. I'm not at home on my g1 phone so cannot confirm zero metrics as ok. Maybe someone else can verify. Doesn't look right to me though
2010-01-21T23:51:00.000Z	_2	actionparsnip	a quick idea of how i'm wired here.    inet--dialup_modem-192.168.0.1-eth0---eth2-192.168.0.6         if that helps any
2010-01-21T23:55:00.000Z	_2	actionparsnip	yes metric's all 0 on gateway also   so that's not a problem.
2010-01-21T23:55:00.000Z	_2	actionparsnip	ummm but i may need to turn on ipv4 forwarding  somewhere ?
2010-01-21T23:56:00.000Z	actionparsnip	_2	sure if the connecting system is a pc
2010-01-22T00:10:00.000Z	_2	actionparsnip	ok, i'll go work on this a while,  i'll let you know if i can't get it worked out.  ;/
