2008-05-28T03:33:00.000Z	Chiselhuk_Plus1		funkyhat: I did that, and it took me to the flash site & there are 3 file formats to d/load! I was told to look for .DEB files 'n there aren't any!! :(
2008-05-28T03:35:00.000Z	Steve-cal	Chiselhuk_Plus1	Why not just install it with Synaptic? "flashplugin-nonfree" is in the repos.
2008-05-28T03:38:00.000Z	Chiselhuk_Plus1	Steve-cal	Thanks, I tried synaptic but it didn't pick up anything I typed! Will look for "flashplugin-nonfree" Thanks *mwah*
2008-05-28T03:39:00.000Z	Steve-cal	Chiselhuk_Plus1	You have to make sure all of your repositories are enabled in the "Software Sources"...
2008-05-28T03:39:00.000Z	Chiselhuk_Plus1	Steve-cal	You say that like u think I know wot i'm doing!! lol
2008-05-28T03:40:00.000Z	Chiselhuk_Plus1	Steve-cal	How do I do that, plse? :)
2008-05-28T03:41:00.000Z	Steve-cal	Chiselhuk_Plus1	OK, if you are all ready in Synaptic, just go to the menu "Settings" and choose "Repositories"
2008-05-28T03:44:00.000Z	Chiselhuk_Plus1	Steve-cal	I'm there now.....
2008-05-28T03:44:00.000Z	Chiselhuk_Plus1	Steve-cal	everything under "ubuntu software" is ticked, do I need to go under the other headings 'n tick stuff too? :)
2008-05-28T03:45:00.000Z	Steve-cal	Chiselhuk_Plus1	You should be OK I think, close it, go back to Synaptic, and hit the "Reload" button...
