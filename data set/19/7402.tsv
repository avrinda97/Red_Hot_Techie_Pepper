2008-03-20T19:24:00.000Z	neopsyche_		hi.. i need to connect to wireless using my linux pc.
2008-03-20T19:24:00.000Z	neopsyche_		in other words.. i need to use my ubuntu box as AP for my laptop.
2008-03-20T19:25:00.000Z	neopsyche_		I have configured Atheros card.. but now need to configure it to be the AP for laptop.
2008-03-20T19:26:00.000Z	recon69	neopsyche_	: you ever think of getting a wireless router , it's much easer and not that dear
2008-03-20T19:27:00.000Z	neopsyche_	recon69	no resources for that .. please dont take up lines of text if you are not able to help me with this issue.
2008-03-20T20:00:00.000Z	recon69	neopsyche_	: you need to do the AP step by step, first get internet working on wired computer from the radio connection, then setup you local wireless network unencrypted, then setup the bridge on you main computer using ipchains
2008-03-20T20:01:00.000Z	neopsyche_	recon69	can you talk me through it.
2008-03-20T20:01:00.000Z	recon69	neopsyche_	: well, first do you have internet on you main PC?
2008-03-20T20:02:00.000Z	neopsyche_	recon69	yes.. that is how i am talking to you.. have you looked at the png?
2008-03-20T20:05:00.000Z	recon69	neopsyche_	:  well, I setup APHOST a couple of years ago to do this. took quite a while to get working
2008-03-20T20:07:00.000Z	neopsyche_	recon69	what is your suggestion?
2008-03-20T20:09:00.000Z	neopsyche_	recon69	any suggestions?
2008-03-20T20:09:00.000Z	recon69	neopsyche_	: well, first check that you wireless card is working on main pc. use ipconfig to see what interfaces you have setup
2008-03-20T20:10:00.000Z	recon69	neopsyche_	: well i take it you have a pc that has a wired connection to your isp, and you want the pc to share the connection wireless to your lap top
2008-03-20T20:13:00.000Z	recon69	neopsyche_	: so you need 3 interfaces. eth0 for your ips connection, ra0 for you wireless network and br0 as a bridge between the two. so run ipconfig and post it so we can have a look at what is working now.
2008-03-20T20:16:00.000Z	recon69	neopsyche_	the AP is a bit of software that makes your computer act as a internet server. gives IP address and such.
2008-03-20T20:16:00.000Z	recon69	neopsyche_	most people just buy a router as it's so much easer
2008-03-20T20:19:00.000Z	neopsyche_	recon69	YES AP .. THATS WHAT I NEED TO SET UP. (AND YES I KNOW I AM USING CAPS)
2008-03-20T20:19:00.000Z	recon69	neopsyche_	but to set it you, you need to set up your wireless card with some access point software. the first step to getting help is to run ipconfig on the command line and post the results into a paste box !!!!
