2009-02-05T02:23:00.000Z	KenBW2		if i upgrade to hardy through Update Manager will i be able to downgrade afterwards if needed
2009-02-05T02:25:00.000Z	joco	KenBW2	Not that I know of, but I have not searched the forums on it, I was on Intrepid and reverted back to Hardy, tip: download and burn the ISO for Hardy now, also make backups, if all works well, then you have some christmas tree ornaments
2009-02-05T02:27:00.000Z	KenBW2	joco	how did you "revert"?
2009-02-05T02:28:00.000Z	joco	KenBW2	After the intrepid upgrade, I used the ISO's that I made on Hardy and just reinstalled, sorta.
2009-02-05T02:29:00.000Z	KenBW2	joco	you effectively wiped Intrepid and installed Hardy?
2009-02-05T02:30:00.000Z	joco	KenBW2	Yes, the Hardy reformatted over the Intrepid and it worked, I am now on Hardy 8.01.2
2009-02-05T02:30:00.000Z	KenBW2	joco	i was trying to avoid a reinstall
2009-02-05T02:31:00.000Z	joco	KenBW2	What are you on now?
2009-02-05T02:31:00.000Z	KenBW2	joco	hardy
2009-02-05T02:33:00.000Z	KenBW2	joco	i have /home on its own partition if that's what you mena
2009-02-05T02:34:00.000Z	joco	KenBW2	No, I mean a Home backup, on CD-R or DVD-r, I like to play it with all options covered.
2009-02-05T02:36:00.000Z	KenBW2	joco	just had a thought... the reason i'm wary about upgrading to Intrepid is because i installed it only to find it doesnt support my network card. Would it work to install Intrepid in a VM and troubleshoot it there, and then apply the fix(es) to a real install afterwards??
2009-02-05T02:38:00.000Z	joco	KenBW2	That sounds very logical, and perhaps you could workaround the error, it must be solve able becuase it is an upgrade, or it could be broken for the same reasons.
2009-02-05T02:39:00.000Z	KenBW2	joco	i installed Hardy with the intention of trying an upgrade to Intrepid
2009-02-05T02:39:00.000Z	KenBW2	joco	but ive invested too much time into this install to bork it now
2009-02-05T02:40:00.000Z	KenBW2	joco	?
2009-02-05T02:42:00.000Z	KenBW2	joco	i take it you mean Update Manager?
2009-02-05T02:42:00.000Z	joco	KenBW2	Yes
2009-02-05T02:44:00.000Z	KenBW2	joco	taxi :D
