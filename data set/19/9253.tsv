2006-12-04T14:34:00.000Z	g0tw00d		where would I start....lol ....<---new to ubuntu
2006-12-04T14:36:00.000Z	g0tw00d		its a Dell USB mouse
2006-12-04T14:36:00.000Z	bray	g0tw00d	Do you know the model number?
2006-12-04T14:34:00.000Z	bray	g0tw00d	You may need to get drivers for it
2006-12-04T14:35:00.000Z	bray	g0tw00d	Well, you might try your mouse maker's website and see if they have the binaries for it. Most binaries come with instructions on how to install them
2006-12-04T14:38:00.000Z	bray	g0tw00d	Is it really that short? Must be an old one...
2006-12-04T14:39:00.000Z	bray	g0tw00d	My bad, I meant p/n
2006-12-04T14:40:00.000Z	g0tw00d	bray	0YH933 is DP/N
2006-12-04T14:43:00.000Z	bray	g0tw00d	I can't seem to find it... go to the dell website and try searching all the numbers you can find, and if all else fails, try searching for the product (eg. Dell P990)
2006-12-04T14:44:00.000Z	bray	g0tw00d	I'm not sure. They might. If not, I'll go look through the forums and the wiki to see if I can find anything about mice
2006-12-04T14:46:00.000Z	bray	g0tw00d	Well... search for your mouse type on the forums (http://www.ubuntuforums.com) and see if you can find anything
2006-12-04T14:59:00.000Z	g0tw00d	bray	after some searching it looks liek a very common issue
2006-12-04T14:59:00.000Z	g0tw00d	bray	I see people blaming dell for BIOS problems....which i don't believe it works with XP
2006-12-04T15:00:00.000Z	bray	g0tw00d	Ok, well there you go... did you find a troubleshoot or a walkthrough or anything like that?
2006-12-04T15:00:00.000Z	g0tw00d	bray	I did find where they said using USB hub works and plugging mousing into usb slot on keyboard
2006-12-04T15:00:00.000Z	g0tw00d	bray	I am tryign this first thx for your help
2006-12-04T15:00:00.000Z	bray	g0tw00d	np, if you need anymore help, I should be here for a while longer
2006-12-04T15:01:00.000Z	bray	g0tw00d	Haha, yeah, that happens when you're first learning
