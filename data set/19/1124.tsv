2011-05-07T04:40:00.000Z	ErezCohen		what is the best way to cennect to a remote server over the web?
2011-05-07T04:41:00.000Z	ErezCohen		server = Ubuntu 10.04
2011-05-07T04:43:00.000Z	KNUBBIG	ErezCohen	SSH?
2011-05-07T04:44:00.000Z	KNUBBIG	ErezCohen	nope, just ssh
2011-05-07T04:45:00.000Z	KNUBBIG	ErezCohen	hum maybe .. what do you want to do? ;)
2011-05-07T04:47:00.000Z	ErezCohen	KNUBBIG	i am starting with open source development this days, installed ubuntu 10.04 with apache and all the rest and i want to be able to connect to the www directory from outside of the lan (so i could work not only form home/office and also let my designer work on the filed....so i need to allow connection over the internet to the network and the server
2011-05-07T04:48:00.000Z	KNUBBIG	ErezCohen	so you want to set up a web server and have no idea how to do that?
2011-05-07T04:49:00.000Z	ErezCohen	KNUBBIG	i am learning on the fly, what can i do, do you know anyone that knew every thing from the start? :-)
2011-05-07T04:50:00.000Z	KNUBBIG	ErezCohen	well it's a long process, you have to set up apache, your router, NAT on your router, users and groups on your server, maybe there's a tutorial @ howtoforge
2011-05-07T04:50:00.000Z	ErezCohen	KNUBBIG	i did all of that
2011-05-07T04:51:00.000Z	KNUBBIG	ErezCohen	ah okay, than you probably have to change your firewall/router settings if you can do all the things in LAN
2011-05-07T04:52:00.000Z	KNUBBIG	ErezCohen	then please reexplain your problem in detail, I don't get it :)
2011-05-07T04:54:00.000Z	ErezCohen	KNUBBIG	ok, i will explain...sorry, all i am asking is...After having a NAT set up, an Apache2 server, and ssh connection from the server to the laptop inside a LAN, and every thing is working great...now i want to connect from the internet over secured connection, (OVER THE INTERNET) what do i need to do...that is all. All the rest is set up already
2011-05-07T04:56:00.000Z	KNUBBIG	ErezCohen	you have to forward port 22 and then you should be able to ssh your server through the internet
2011-05-07T04:57:00.000Z	KNUBBIG	ErezCohen	ssh -l user server
2011-05-07T04:57:00.000Z	KNUBBIG	ErezCohen	see ssh --help :)
2011-05-07T04:58:00.000Z	ErezCohen	KNUBBIG	ok, never used -l when using is localy...but i will chekc it...10x
2011-05-07T04:58:00.000Z	KNUBBIG	ErezCohen	-l is for giving login name, if you don't set it, ssh will use your current username which is sometimes desirable and sometimes not :)
2011-05-07T04:59:00.000Z	ErezCohen	KNUBBIG	ok thx :-)
