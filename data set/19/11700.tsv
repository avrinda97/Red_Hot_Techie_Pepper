2005-12-06T06:18:00.000Z	aptiko		Hi, I'm trying to install ubuntu on a powerpc using xfs.  When it boots for the first time, I get "kernel panic: vfs: unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(0,0)".
2005-12-06T06:19:00.000Z	oskude	aptiko	do you know in which partition you installed ubuntu ?
2005-12-06T06:19:00.000Z	aptiko		Yes, it should be /dev/hda3.
2005-12-06T06:20:00.000Z	aptiko		(I'm now booting from a live cd to check it.)
2005-12-06T06:21:00.000Z	oskude	aptiko	ok, then in grub (the start menu at boot) go to the ubuntu entry and press "e", then edit the "hd(0,0)" to "hd(0,2)" and press "b"
2005-12-06T06:21:00.000Z	aptiko	oskude	No grub.  I've got yaboot.
2005-12-06T06:21:00.000Z	oskude	aptiko	doh, forgot that :)
2005-12-06T06:21:00.000Z	aptiko		oskide: But I'll try to see if I can do it on yaboot.
2005-12-06T06:22:00.000Z	oskude	aptiko	theres allso away booting through "open firmware" (if your mac has it)
2005-12-06T06:25:00.000Z	oskude		[A] ndy80, have you looken under System>Preferences or >Administration ? (i never had/used suspend, sry)
2005-12-06T06:25:00.000Z	oskude		*looked
2005-12-06T06:25:00.000Z	oskude		doh
2005-12-06T06:28:00.000Z	aptiko	oskude	yaboot tells me that I caould specify "device" and "partno" parameters, and that if I don't, the defaults are "device=/pci@f40000000/ata-6@d/disk@0" and "partition=3".  So yaboot must be having the correct information.
2005-12-06T06:29:00.000Z	oskude	aptiko	hmm
2005-12-06T06:29:00.000Z	aptiko		I think I'd like to have an ext3 root partition of, say 300M,
2005-12-06T06:29:00.000Z	aptiko		and have all the rest in another partition (I think the problem could be the xfs).
2005-12-06T06:30:00.000Z	aptiko		Is it possible to install ubuntu in such a way that /var, /usr and /home are all in the same partition?
2005-12-06T06:30:00.000Z	oskude	aptiko	you can have all (except swap) in one partition
2005-12-06T06:30:00.000Z	oskude	aptiko	if you just define "/" partition at install, all others are in there
