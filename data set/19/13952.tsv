2005-01-31T10:14:00.000Z	melazyboy		does anyone have an idea why after i get xorg-fglrx-driver, I can't modprbe it, i get module fglrx not found
2005-01-31T10:14:00.000Z	diego	melazyboy	xorg modules and kernel modules are not the same
2005-01-31T10:15:00.000Z	melazyboy	diego	so if i edit xorg.conf and put it fglrx for card driver, you would expect it to work?
2005-01-31T10:15:00.000Z	diego	melazyboy	sounds good
2005-01-31T10:15:00.000Z	melazyboy	diego	is there anyway to force load a module into xorg without logging out, just out of curiosity
2005-01-31T10:16:00.000Z	diego	melazyboy	hmm not that i know of
2005-01-31T10:18:00.000Z	melazyboy	diego	wow, ok any idea why im still getting such low fps in glxgears im only getting 1243, im getting a warning in xgears, 'Xlinb: extension "Xfree86-DRI" missing on display ":0:0".
2005-01-31T10:19:00.000Z	diego	melazyboy	meh i dunno
2005-01-31T10:25:00.000Z	melazyboy	diego	god this is so not working
2005-01-31T10:25:00.000Z	diego	melazyboy	roofle
2005-01-31T10:25:00.000Z	melazyboy	diego	fglrx, must be a kernel module.
2005-01-31T10:25:00.000Z	melazyboy	diego	type lsmod |grep fglrx
2005-01-31T10:25:00.000Z	diego	melazyboy	look through the filesystem for it
2005-01-31T10:25:00.000Z	melazyboy	diego	im sure you have it im only getting 250fps
2005-01-31T10:25:00.000Z	melazyboy	diego	why isn't it just installing to the right place with apt-get or why am i not getting an error of any sort
2005-01-31T10:27:00.000Z	diego	melazyboy	nope, said a minute ago i was using a geforce 5650 go! on a half-way related subject
2005-01-31T10:28:00.000Z	diego	melazyboy	what files does it provide?
