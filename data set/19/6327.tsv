2008-02-10T10:06:00.000Z	_Oz_		I can't get VM to start
2008-02-10T10:08:00.000Z	_Oz_		you around, badkitty?
2008-02-10T10:08:00.000Z	_Oz_		...  you didn't reply
2008-02-10T10:10:00.000Z	_Oz_		wow
2008-02-10T10:10:00.000Z	_Oz_		my machine is now massively messed up
2008-02-10T10:10:00.000Z	_Oz_		something vm did made ubuntu very unhappy
2008-02-10T10:10:00.000Z	Scunizi	_Oz_	which vm manager are you using?
2008-02-10T10:11:00.000Z	Scunizi	_Oz_	sorry I don't know that one.. I'm using vmware server.. pretty easy.
2008-02-10T10:13:00.000Z	Scunizi	_Oz_	with server you can install any os from cd or iso. with player you're limited to preconfigured vm's
2008-02-10T11:01:00.000Z	Scunizi	_Oz_	sort of simple in windows..
2008-02-10T11:02:00.000Z	Scunizi	_Oz_	kinda like an .exe.. with variations..
2008-02-22T09:11:00.000Z	Scunizi	_Oz_	have you tried gimp with the mods.. gimpshop.. it rearranges the menu structure to mirror photoshop
2008-02-22T09:14:00.000Z	Scunizi	_Oz_	illistrator maybe inkscape or scribus
2008-02-22T09:15:00.000Z	_Oz_	Scunizi	I could probably stand to switch from Illustrator since I don't use it as much, but I do need the ability to save .AIs and open them
2008-02-22T09:15:00.000Z	Scunizi	_Oz_	you can run windows in a window on gnome, kde, xfce.. sorry .ai's are tough.. nothing doing here for that.
2008-02-22T09:16:00.000Z	Scunizi	_Oz_	could you export .ai's as postscript or something and import them?
2008-02-22T09:16:00.000Z	_Oz_	Scunizi	maybe...  but from a practical perspective, probably not.  People expect to exchange those files freely with me.
2008-02-22T09:20:00.000Z	Scunizi	_Oz_	take a look at krita
2008-02-22T09:25:00.000Z	Scunizi	_Oz_	check out www.tigerdirect.com I saw some today.
