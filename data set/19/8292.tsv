2007-06-12T14:55:00.000Z	Dacvak		Can someone help me run Beryl?
2007-06-12T14:55:00.000Z	Dacvak		I believe I installed it correctly, but it's not running properly.
2007-06-12T14:19:00.000Z	Dacvak		I need some hardcore help fixing my MBR, if anyone would be able to help me...
2007-06-12T14:20:00.000Z	Dacvak		I installed Ubuntu on one hard drive with XP on a different one.
2007-06-12T14:20:00.000Z	Dacvak		I finally got Ubuntu to boot, but XP won't boot anymore.
2007-06-12T14:20:00.000Z	idefixx	Dacvak	just (re)install grub to /dev/sda (or /dev/hda) and that fixes the mbr.
2007-06-12T14:21:00.000Z	idefixx	Dacvak	ok i though u broke your mbr.. if windows doesnt boot its probably not the mbr
2007-06-12T14:22:00.000Z	idefixx	Dacvak	what happens when you select windows from the Bootloader menu?
2007-06-12T14:24:00.000Z	idefixx	Dacvak	insert your windows cd start the >'Recovery Console'< log into your windows (it prompts for the admin pw) after that type 'fixboot' and be done with it.
2007-06-12T14:24:00.000Z	idefixx	Dacvak	also i was asking for the error msg. Does it or does it not say 'ntldr not found'
2007-06-12T15:56:00.000Z	idefixx	Dacvak	did you do what i told you before.. boot with the windows cd in recovery mode?
2007-06-12T15:56:00.000Z	Dacvak	idefixx	I don't have my Windows CD... I was going to burn another copy of it, but Ubuntu won't let me install any new programs
2007-06-12T15:57:00.000Z	idefixx	Dacvak	do you have a floppy drive?
2007-06-12T15:58:00.000Z	idefixx	Dacvak	do you have/can you boot from an usb-stick?
2007-06-12T15:58:00.000Z	Dacvak	idefixx	I can boot from CD, if that helps...
2007-06-12T15:59:00.000Z	idefixx	Dacvak	dumb me.. yes that helps google for 'super grub' download and brun the iso. boot from it and use the 'restore bootsector' command in it.
2007-06-12T16:00:00.000Z	Dacvak	idefixx	I'd try that, but I don't have any burning software on Ubuntu right now, and the fscking thing won't let me add any new programs
2007-06-13T16:01:00.000Z	idefixx	Dacvak	well in that case get a windows cd and use the recovery console... i cant help you without any of the essential tools, sry.
2007-06-13T16:06:00.000Z	idefixx	Dacvak	bwt you should be able to burn isos with ubuntu out of the box by right clicking on them in nautilus.
