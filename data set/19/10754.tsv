2006-05-16T14:36:00.000Z	inx|David		i wonder if the live disk works
2006-05-16T14:36:00.000Z	inx|David		i really want ubuntu on my laptop
2006-05-16T14:36:00.000Z	doctormo	inx|David	whats wrong?
2006-05-16T14:37:00.000Z	doctormo	inx|David	sounds like the wrong cpu
2006-05-16T14:38:00.000Z	doctormo	inx|David	and what is the linux compiled for?
2006-05-16T14:39:00.000Z	doctormo	inx|David	386? 586? 686? AMD64? P4?
2006-05-16T14:40:00.000Z	inx|David	doctormo	should i download a different one?
2006-05-16T14:41:00.000Z	doctormo	inx|David	the problem is that AMD chip might be something special and I'm not sure if ubuntu is clever enough to install 386 or amd64 kernel
2006-05-16T14:42:00.000Z	doctormo	inx|David	so your best bet I think is to compile your kernel
2006-05-16T14:42:00.000Z	doctormo	inx|David	actualy before that, do a search with apt-cache search kernel to see if there is an amd64 version
2006-05-16T14:45:00.000Z	doctormo	inx|David	yes?
2006-05-16T14:46:00.000Z	doctormo	inx|David	ok, you can use grep to limit the results, press up to get back to the same command and type after it | grep -i amd
2006-05-16T14:49:00.000Z	doctormo	inx|David	did you manage to get the livecd to work?
2006-05-16T14:51:00.000Z	doctormo	inx|David	yea I'd say that was a damn cpu issue, what do you end up with when you install? just a command prompt right?
2006-05-16T14:52:00.000Z	doctormo	inx|David	sudo apt-get install kernel-source-2.6.11
2006-05-16T14:52:00.000Z	inx|David	doctormo	cant find it
2006-05-16T15:00:00.000Z	doctormo	inx|David	I just installed a desktop machine with a samperon amd64 and it worked fine...
2006-05-16T15:29:00.000Z	doctormo	inx|David	have you tried other linux distros?
