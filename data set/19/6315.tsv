2008-04-07T23:27:00.000Z	Survivorman	yaselmane	how are you trying to make your document?
2008-04-07T23:27:00.000Z	Survivorman	yaselmane	ie which program? command line?
2008-04-07T23:28:00.000Z	Survivorman	yaselmane	so you right click, go to create document and nothing happens?
2008-04-07T23:30:00.000Z	Survivorman	yaselmane	ok. are you using gnome? does it even highlight the generic name on the screen?
2008-04-07T23:33:00.000Z	Survivorman	yaselmane	I'm looking it up, but that's a new one to me. so the keyboard is fine otherwise? And you're using ubuntu, not kubuntu? And it's gutsy?
2008-04-07T23:34:00.000Z	Survivorman	yaselmane	can you right click and rename a folder in your home directory?
2008-04-07T23:34:00.000Z	Survivorman	yaselmane	or can you do it from the terminal?
2008-04-07T23:36:00.000Z	Survivorman	yaselmane	have you installed any language support for additional languages recently? I'm just reading some bugs reports similar to your situation, and that was one cause.
2008-04-07T23:37:00.000Z	Survivorman	yaselmane	you did? There was a bug report saying that the fix was to uninstall the language support.
2008-04-07T23:37:00.000Z	Survivorman	yaselmane	that may be the cause. here is an example with a japanese pack installed.
2008-04-07T23:39:00.000Z	Survivorman	yaselmane	well I know that fixed the problem, I don't know how to deal with the bug. You might be able to google it further. If you need the packs, you could possibly download and use thunar file manager to rename, but you'd never be able to do it with right click.
2008-04-07T23:39:00.000Z	Survivorman	yaselmane	or you could rename from the terminal.
2008-04-07T23:42:00.000Z	Survivorman	yaselmane	after you do it a few times, it becomes quite easy :)
2008-04-07T23:42:00.000Z	Survivorman	yaselmane	no problem
