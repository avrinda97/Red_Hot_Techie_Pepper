2011-06-01T01:13:00.000Z	Koobalita		Wow some really nifty questions
2011-06-01T01:14:00.000Z	Koobalita		I can just watch and laern :D
2011-06-01T01:15:00.000Z	Koobalita		I first had FEdora
2011-06-01T01:15:00.000Z	Koobalita		then I went to UBUntu easier
2011-06-01T01:15:00.000Z	Koobalita		if there is an easier Linux Distro then Ubuntu then I am up for it!
2011-06-01T01:16:00.000Z	Koobalita		AS Fast as possible and as windowsy as possible :D
2011-06-01T01:17:00.000Z	Koobalita		Ya I thought so but ya never know
2011-06-01T01:17:00.000Z	KM0201	Koobalita	being "windowsy" is a negative IMO..
2011-06-01T01:22:00.000Z	KM0201	Koobalita	as longa syou're not effected by the freezing issues.
2011-06-01T01:23:00.000Z	KM0201	Koobalita	i like it, when it works..lol
2011-06-01T01:24:00.000Z	KM0201	Koobalita	thus my clarifying statement, if it works, its awesome... the recent version is the issue.
2011-06-01T01:24:00.000Z	KM0201	Koobalita	no
2011-06-01T01:25:00.000Z	KM0201	Koobalita	my point, if its not effecting you, thats the reason its awesome.. if it was, you'd be a little more than upset when your whole system locks up.
2011-06-01T01:33:00.000Z	KM0201	Koobalita	easiest way is to install gnomebaker and use it to burn the image to a CD
2011-06-01T01:34:00.000Z	KM0201	Koobalita	not really, about the only thing.. when you burn an ISO, burn them as slow as possible.
2011-06-01T01:34:00.000Z	KM0201	Koobalita	just sudo apt-get install gnomebaker then go to gnomebaker and tools/burn CD(or DVD) ISO".. then from there is pretty much self explanatory
2011-06-01T01:35:00.000Z	KM0201	Koobalita	lol
2011-06-01T01:40:00.000Z	KM0201	Koobalita	just do the defaults.. only thing you should need to change, is make sure it burns as slow as possible  Koobilito
