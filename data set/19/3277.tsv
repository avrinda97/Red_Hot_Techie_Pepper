2010-03-16T18:52:00.000Z	theadmin		Any idea whether Compiz runs with KDE?
2010-03-16T18:52:00.000Z	eremite	theadmin	yes it does
2010-03-16T18:52:00.000Z	eremite	theadmin	I would assume it does.
2010-03-16T18:53:00.000Z	eremite	theadmin	it does not jive well with Fluxbox, OpenBox, BlackBox, Icewm ETC.
2010-03-16T18:53:00.000Z	theadmin	eremite	icewm? I thought that's a window manager?
2010-03-16T18:54:00.000Z	eremite	theadmin	yes, but if you dont have a full environment installed compiz wont work.  Many peopel dont recognize the difference between a full desktop environment and a WM when not familiar with the terms.
2010-03-17T22:57:00.000Z	eremite	theadmin	nothing as far as I know.
2010-03-17T22:58:00.000Z	eremite	theadmin	maybe Ubuntu's is optimized for use with the Ubuntu system.
2010-03-17T22:58:00.000Z	theadmin	eremite	Well except the About box? And the loading screen (it is orange instead of blue)
2010-03-17T22:59:00.000Z	eremite	theadmin	the only difference I can think of is that the one from the ubuntu repos is easily updated, manually installed versions are not.
2010-03-17T23:00:00.000Z	theadmin	eremite	Well, i guess. Icons are also different (from Windows version, at least)
2010-03-17T23:01:00.000Z	eremite	theadmin	minor visual differences like icons are hardly in the way of productivity.  If you were to change your Windows system-wide icon theme, your OO icons would look different than they do now.  Just like Ubuntu.
2010-03-17T23:01:00.000Z	theadmin	eremite	Meh, Windows version of OOo uses old GTK icons, so theme does not affect those
2010-03-17T23:02:00.000Z	eremite	theadmin	I wouldnt know, I dont use windows for openoffice.
2010-03-23T15:57:00.000Z	theadmin	eremite	Same here o_O That's really fast
2010-03-23T16:35:00.000Z	eremite	theadmin	use the search utility?  Faster usually.
2010-03-23T16:35:00.000Z	theadmin	eremite	I'm helping a friend of mine, don't have a local apache installation
2010-03-23T16:36:00.000Z	eremite	theadmin	tell yoru firend to use the search utility?
2010-03-23T16:36:00.000Z	theadmin	eremite	Problem is they renamed it to something like apache.conf or apache2.conf or whatever
