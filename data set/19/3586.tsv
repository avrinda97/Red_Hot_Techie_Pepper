2009-07-09T23:23:00.000Z	ctmjr	Agent11	what exactly is not working?
2009-07-09T23:26:00.000Z	ctmjr	Agent11	by not installing what kind of error do you get
2009-07-09T23:27:00.000Z	Agent11	ctmjr	it doesnt give an error really. it just doesnt do anything. with envyng it just gets stuck at 71% for installing the drivers and freezes up. off of the official sites download it says to terminate x server or something, i looked into it and.. probably did something wrong, because it didnt go well.
2009-07-09T23:35:00.000Z	ctmjr	Agent11	to install the driver from nvidia you need to go into a terminal crtl + alt + f1 then sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop then run the installer
2009-07-09T23:37:00.000Z	ctmjr	Agent11	sorry that is how you get into the terminal
2009-07-09T23:38:00.000Z	Agent11	ctmjr	yea pretty bad about this. that is the same terminal as applications>accessories>terminal, right?
2009-07-09T23:38:00.000Z	ctmjr	Agent11	no
2009-07-09T23:39:00.000Z	Agent11	ctmjr	well ctrl-alt-f1 doesnt seem to be.. doing anything, as far as i see at least
2009-07-09T23:41:00.000Z	Agent11	ctmjr	should i be seeing something when i hit Ctrl+alt+f1?
2009-07-09T23:45:00.000Z	ctmjr	Agent11	reboot into rescue mode then run the installer
2009-07-09T23:46:00.000Z	Agent11	ctmjr	will i still need to run sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop or just run the installer?
2009-07-09T23:46:00.000Z	ctmjr	Agent11	just the installer
2009-07-09T23:46:00.000Z	Agent11	ctmjr	alright, trying that now.
