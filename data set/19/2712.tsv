2011-07-13T08:21:00.000Z	alesan		I wanted to configure thunderbird to use the correct application when I open a .doc file
2011-07-13T08:21:00.000Z	alesan		and I need to specify the binary used to open such MIME type
2011-07-13T08:21:00.000Z	alesan		thanks anyway
2011-07-13T08:21:00.000Z	alesan		bye
2011-07-13T08:21:00.000Z	magn3ts	alesan	trust me, you're better off ignoring him.
2011-07-13T08:21:00.000Z	magn3ts	alesan	hold on.
2011-07-13T08:22:00.000Z	alesan	magn3ts	well but he kind of helped me to find the solution
2011-07-13T08:22:00.000Z	alesan		"libreoffice" is the name of the command I need to call
2011-07-13T08:22:00.000Z	magn3ts	alesan	which office app do you want it to open in
2011-07-13T08:22:00.000Z	magn3ts	alesan	for example Writer would be:   `` libreoffice -writer %U ``
2011-07-13T08:22:00.000Z	alesan		the one that is associated with the particular file
2011-07-13T08:23:00.000Z	alesan		well if I have a .doc it should be smart enought to use the writer thing
2011-07-13T08:23:00.000Z	magn3ts	alesan	lol it's making you match mime-types with programs, expecting it to be smart is asking a bit much.
2011-07-13T08:23:00.000Z	magn3ts	alesan	throwing random files at `libreoffice` may work. If it does, good for you I suppose :P
2011-07-13T08:24:00.000Z	alesan	magn3ts	once I assign .doc to "libreoffice" then it opens writer, that's how it works
2011-07-13T08:24:00.000Z	magn3ts	alesan	okay, they must have built that in, sounds like you've got it then.
2011-07-13T08:24:00.000Z	alesan	magn3ts	it always worked with StarOffice and also Openoffice
2011-07-13T08:24:00.000Z	alesan		I remember when you had to download a binary tarball from staroffice.de with a modem 56MB it took all night
2011-07-13T08:24:00.000Z	magn3ts	alesan	I see, sounds good.
