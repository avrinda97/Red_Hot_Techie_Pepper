2008-09-03T11:10:00.000Z	negativefps		hi, i have a small problem. when trying to rebuild the kernel, while in the process, i encounter this problem: http://pastebin.com/d6c6ebf65
2008-09-03T11:10:00.000Z	negativefps		as a result i can't boot because the sata driver won't load
2008-09-03T11:12:00.000Z	niuq	negativefps	how did you rebuild your kernel?
2008-09-03T11:12:00.000Z	negativefps	niuq	well im using arch, but the userbase is really small, i always have a tough time getting support from them
2008-09-03T11:12:00.000Z	negativefps	niuq	im following this guide http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Kernel_Compilation_From_Source
2008-09-03T11:13:00.000Z	niuq	negativefps	well for me rebuilding is not compiling
2008-09-03T11:13:00.000Z	negativefps	niuq	ok wrong terminilogy
2008-09-03T11:15:00.000Z	niuq	negativefps	well since it's a new kernel, it has new "numbers", and your modules are located inside a directory with a different name
2008-09-03T11:16:00.000Z	niuq	negativefps	maybe you can try verifying a match of the location of your modules and the kernel's version
2008-09-03T11:17:00.000Z	negativefps	niuq	hmm, well i'm doing this all from the directory i untarred the original kernel to
2008-09-03T11:17:00.000Z	niuq	negativefps	and you are sure, that your kernel is pointing to the correct directory?
2008-09-03T11:18:00.000Z	negativefps	niuq	i dont see a reason why it wouldn't. im following the guide step by step and not doing anything with the old kernel
2008-09-03T11:18:00.000Z	niuq	negativefps	well that's all i can suggest now, if that doesn't help you, you may ask to another guy, sorry
2008-09-03T11:18:00.000Z	niuq	negativefps	were are your modules located?
2008-09-03T11:19:00.000Z	niuq	negativefps	where*
2008-09-03T11:19:00.000Z	negativefps		i really don't know. just typing commands in the order i see them :P
2008-09-03T11:20:00.000Z	niuq		mmm
2008-09-03T11:20:00.000Z	niuq	negativefps	maybe that's the problem you don't really understand that guide, i suggest you find what the commands are you typing are suppose to do
2008-09-03T11:21:00.000Z	niuq	negativefps	btw sorry for my english hehe, just learning xD
