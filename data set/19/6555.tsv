2009-05-19T14:50:00.000Z	areels	ActionParsnip	is there an easy way to reach linux computors like in windows \\computor\c$ ?
2009-05-19T14:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	areels	you can use samba
2009-05-19T14:50:00.000Z	areels	ActionParsnip	 samba for linux to linux ?
2009-05-19T14:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	areels	sure, why not
2009-05-19T14:51:00.000Z	areels	ActionParsnip	i thought samba for linux to windows
2009-05-19T14:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	areels	your ubuntu install has a samba client app, if you want to conect to another linux system which just happens to be sharing with samba, it will work
2009-05-19T14:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	areels	samba isnt ONLY for windows to linux
2009-06-19T16:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	areels	you can use the find command in terminal or an app like beagle
2009-06-19T16:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	areels	sudo find / -name *.exe | less              is a ood way to find all .exe files
2009-06-19T16:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	areels	you can use any globbing you like, you can even grep the output to make it more sensical
2009-06-19T16:22:00.000Z	areels	ActionParsnip	i'm in trouble with cd burning, can't create proper cd's, %50 of discs are stopping in the middle
2009-06-19T16:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	areels	are you using brasero ?
2009-06-19T16:23:00.000Z	areels	ActionParsnip	 ONLY BRASERO  is working but it's too slow and can't automatically create 10 copies for example
2009-06-19T16:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	areels	if it works i'd run with it. you in a hurry?
2009-06-19T16:25:00.000Z	areels	ActionParsnip	 i'm burning 50 copies now and it's like torture with brasero
2009-07-16T16:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	areels	you can even skin it like XP or mac if it floats your boat
2009-07-16T16:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	areels	9.04 has been out 3 months, they will be fine
