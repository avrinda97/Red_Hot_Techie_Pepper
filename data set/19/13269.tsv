2005-05-07T14:32:00.000Z	eleusis		:)
2005-05-07T14:33:00.000Z	eleusis		it's still competition
2005-05-07T14:33:00.000Z	eleusis		and lack of competition doesn't make a bad product - complacency does
2005-05-07T14:35:00.000Z	eleusis		can you exhaustively prove your point? :P
2005-05-07T14:36:00.000Z	eleusis		examples are just points, they don't cover the whole domain ;)
2005-05-07T14:36:00.000Z	eleusis		XP didn't suck..
2005-05-07T14:36:00.000Z	eleusis		how so?
2005-05-07T14:37:00.000Z	eleusis		hahaha
2005-05-07T14:37:00.000Z	eleusis		you need to read a book about OS design ;)
2005-05-07T14:38:00.000Z	scizzo	eleusis	you need to open your eyes and read about problems people have had
2005-05-07T14:38:00.000Z	eleusis	scizzo	?
2005-05-07T14:39:00.000Z	scizzo	eleusis	look...many people today...AFAIK does only want win because they think they know it....however the problem comes with security when the kernel has over 2xxxxxx open backdoors
2005-05-07T14:40:00.000Z	eleusis	scizzo	um, ok..
2005-05-07T14:41:00.000Z	scizzo	eleusis	The problem is not that people want to change to something better..but because it is the only thing they know...
2005-05-07T14:42:00.000Z	scizzo	eleusis	now...if you look at this also: There was a article like 1 year ago or something that was talking about worms and viruses....Win was the system that was aimed for mostly...and linux has a few of them...Mac OS X had none...at that time
2005-05-07T14:43:00.000Z	scizzo	eleusis	we are not at my work supporting outlook for example...its the customers problem if they use it...I won't fix the damage it might do
2005-05-07T14:43:00.000Z	scizzo	eleusis	that they have stoped with security and hopes that a new interface and a few new features will bring people to the OS
2005-05-07T14:44:00.000Z	scizzo	eleusis	instead of putting time on trying to close the backdoors and look at the security issues
