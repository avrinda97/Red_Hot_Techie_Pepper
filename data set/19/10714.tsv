2006-05-21T10:03:00.000Z	AgentCy		is it possible to get XFree86 to work on Ubuntu?
2006-05-21T10:03:00.000Z	DBO	AgentCy	it probably could be worked out, but why>
2006-05-21T10:04:00.000Z	AgentCy	DBO	Cant get Xorg to work with my laptop
2006-05-21T10:05:00.000Z	DBO	AgentCy	can you please describe what isnt working?
2006-05-21T10:06:00.000Z	AgentCy	DBO	I have a Gateway M350, with intel 810 chipset.. cant get it above 800x600 resolution
2006-05-21T10:07:00.000Z	DBO	AgentCy	look at the link ubotu sent you
2006-05-21T10:08:00.000Z	AgentCy	DBO	Ill give that a whirl I guess
2006-05-21T10:08:00.000Z	DBO	AgentCy	you would have the same issue in XFree86 anyhow, its just a matter of configuring your /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2006-05-21T10:09:00.000Z	AgentCy	DBO	I posted on the forums.. seems I'm S.O.L. with this chipset and my laptop :P
2006-05-21T10:09:00.000Z	DBO	AgentCy	what resolution is your native?
2006-05-21T10:10:00.000Z	DBO	AgentCy	put your /etc/X11/xorg.conf -> pastebin
2006-05-21T10:13:00.000Z	DBO	AgentCy	please put your xorg.conf in pastebin so I can take a look =)
2006-05-21T10:35:00.000Z	AgentCy	DBO	No VGA Buffer Setting
2006-05-21T10:35:00.000Z	DBO	AgentCy	ok, please hold
2006-05-21T10:40:00.000Z	DBO	AgentCy	well you arent going to like this... but I believe you are correct, breezy cannot run at 1024x768 with your i810/LCD combo.  I do know there has been lots of work to the i810 driver and its all in dapper, might be worth a shot?
2006-05-21T10:41:00.000Z	DBO	AgentCy	you have a fine reason to install dapper if you want today
2006-05-21T10:41:00.000Z	DBO	AgentCy	no, you can do an upgrade
2006-05-21T10:42:00.000Z	DBO	AgentCy	first you have to modify /etc/apt/sources.list and change all occurances of the word breezy to dapper, then you do "sudo apt-get update" then "sudo apt-get dist-upgrade"
2006-05-21T10:42:00.000Z	DBO	AgentCy	also make sure to back up all your important data
