2006-01-03T12:53:00.000Z	tonyyarusso		Okay, so I've gathered a little bit more diagnostic information, so maybe someone can help me now.
2006-01-03T12:53:00.000Z	tonyyarusso		The issue is: console switching capability is messed up.
2006-01-03T12:54:00.000Z	tonyyarusso		On a normal boot, X starts, I log in to my desktop, and after that Ctrl-Alt-F# doesn't work.
2006-01-03T12:54:00.000Z	tonyyarusso		However, I can open up gnome-terminal, and /etc/init.d/gdm stop.
2006-01-03T12:55:00.000Z	tonyyarusso		After that, I can switch between consoles just fine.
2006-01-03T12:55:00.000Z	tonyyarusso		Additionally, I can log in on tty2 and use startx.
2006-01-03T12:56:00.000Z	tonyyarusso		After issueing startx from the console, it starts up on tty7 as usual, and from there my console switching is still fine, with X running.
2006-01-03T12:56:00.000Z	Squee-D	tonyyarusso	it's not taking keystrokes when you 'should have switched' is it?
2006-01-03T12:56:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Squee-D	You mean when it's first up, what happens?
2006-01-03T12:57:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Squee-D	In a terminal, Ctrl-Alt-F(1-4) was typing as P, Q, R, and S, respectively.
2006-01-03T12:57:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Squee-D	Ctrl-Alt-F(5-12) were ;7~
2006-01-03T12:58:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Squee-D	I also know it still recognized them, because in the keyboard shortcuts menu I could set Ctrl-Alt-F1 as a shortcut for something.
2006-01-03T12:58:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Squee-D	It means nothing to me though, so any translation would be helpful.
2006-01-03T13:00:00.000Z	Squee-D	tonyyarusso	its just I had this problem once, but im terribly helpless too. What i did was search /etc/X11 and all those . dirs in my home dir for something looking like a shortcut. removed, tested. failed.. replaced and moved on until i finally found the setting. that was quite some time ago.
2006-01-03T13:01:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Squee-D	A shortcut to what?  You succeeded eventually?
2006-01-03T13:01:00.000Z	Squee-D	tonyyarusso	yes i did, but thats as far as my memory takes me, and it may not apply to your problem at all.
2006-01-03T13:02:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Squee-D	Okay.
2006-01-03T13:02:00.000Z	Squee-D	tonyyarusso	i think im more of a confusion to you than a help
2006-01-03T13:03:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Squee-D	or intelikey: Do you know what types of things I might be looking for in something like the init.d script?
