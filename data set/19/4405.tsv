2009-02-01T02:28:00.000Z	Mood		Hello. Is it possible to remote compute into another Ubuntu box? (not ssh, but something similar to Windows Remote Computing)
2009-02-01T02:30:00.000Z	Mood		Ravel_: any hints for me to google?
2009-02-01T02:30:00.000Z	jtaji	Mood	easiest way is system > prefs > remote desktop, and enable sharing on the target machine, then use Remote Desktop Viewer
2009-02-01T02:31:00.000Z	Mood	jtaji	i'm using xubuntu, so i don't have system -> prefs -> remote desktop. do you know what package it is?
2009-02-01T02:31:00.000Z	jtaji	Mood	nope sorry
2009-02-01T02:32:00.000Z	Mood	jtaji	but it's called "remote desktop"?
2009-02-01T02:32:00.000Z	Mood	jtaji	in ubuntu it's called "remote desktop"?
2009-02-01T02:32:00.000Z	jtaji	Mood	it's a part of the Gnome desktop
2009-02-01T02:32:00.000Z	Mood	jtaji	ahh, oi. i'm using xfce. i'll have to find an equivalent
2009-02-01T02:33:00.000Z	jtaji	Mood	perhaps the x11vnc package
2009-02-01T02:34:00.000Z	Mood	jtaji	would you recommend remote desktop in practice? or is there really no advantage over ssh?
2009-02-01T02:35:00.000Z	Mood	jtaji	/ Ravel_: i need to help troubleshoot a friend's ubuntu box remotely. i don't know whether i could simply use ssh and poke around, or whether i need to install some remote desktop software
2009-02-01T02:35:00.000Z	jtaji	Mood	I use ssh for all my administration
2009-02-01T02:36:00.000Z	jtaji	Mood	is your friend running Gnome
2009-02-01T02:36:00.000Z	Mood	jtaji	they are running gnome. but i'm running xfce
2009-02-01T02:36:00.000Z	jtaji	Mood	you can set up the server on their end like I mentioned, then use any vnc client on your end
2009-02-01T02:37:00.000Z	jtaji	Mood	you can do everything over ssh, one of the great things about ubuntu is that gui tools don't mess up text config files
2009-02-01T02:38:00.000Z	jtaji	Mood	they coexist peacefully ;)
2009-02-01T02:38:00.000Z	Mood	jtaji	ah ok. thanks momomo + Ravel_
