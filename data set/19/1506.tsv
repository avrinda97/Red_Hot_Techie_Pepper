2011-01-08T04:35:00.000Z	mosty	cradam	isn't there a "get third party hardware drivers" icon bugging you when you login?
2011-01-08T04:39:00.000Z	mosty	cradam	they are all installed for you when you install ubuntu
2011-01-08T04:40:00.000Z	mosty	cradam	nope. if it works, you're good to go
2011-01-08T04:42:00.000Z	mosty	cradam	that's because it's using your hard drive a lot
2011-01-08T04:43:00.000Z	cradam	mosty	dreamwalk its a rubbish netbook, 488MB ram and a GHz processor
2011-01-08T04:43:00.000Z	mosty	cradam	this is normal behaviour for a netbook, nothing to worry about
2011-01-08T04:44:00.000Z	cradam	mosty	 is unity meant to work on first boot?
2011-01-08T04:44:00.000Z	mosty	cradam	no i meant that things slow down when running a software update
2011-01-08T04:57:00.000Z	mosty	cradam	can you paste the exact message?
2011-01-08T04:58:00.000Z	mosty	cradam	i know but i don't think anyone can help without more details
2011-01-08T04:59:00.000Z	mosty	cradam	try pasting it in google first, then ask here if you can't find anything
2011-01-08T05:13:00.000Z	cradam	mosty	no required driver detected for unity. you will need to choose the ubuntu desktop edition once you select your user name. if you are yousing a live cd then your username is ubuntu with a password of ubuntu
2011-01-08T05:16:00.000Z	cradam	mosty	 i just found a solution on the first link on google lol
2011-01-08T05:16:00.000Z	mosty	cradam	great- because that error message is really crappy ;)
2011-01-08T05:18:00.000Z	mosty	cradam	what video chipset do you have?
2011-01-08T05:19:00.000Z	mosty	cradam	login and install the proprietary nvidia driver
2011-01-08T05:19:00.000Z	mosty	cradam	do a google search for ubuntu nvidia
