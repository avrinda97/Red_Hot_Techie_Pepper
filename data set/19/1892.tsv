2010-09-06T23:45:00.000Z	Grappleseed		what size is the ubuntu installer?
2010-09-06T23:45:00.000Z	Grappleseed		my browser has a habit of half downloading files and saying they're complete
2010-09-06T23:45:00.000Z	Grappleseed		thanks dpac_: the size i have is 22.3 mb -_-
2010-09-06T23:46:00.000Z	Grappleseed		Incidentally, does anyone know how to fix this problem with Google Chrome?
2010-09-06T23:47:00.000Z	Grappleseed		Thanks dpac_, do you know of a good torrent to download the current ubuntu iso on?
2010-09-06T23:47:00.000Z	Grappleseed		I do have a very poor connection, so you're probably right.
2010-09-06T23:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Grappleseed	could try chromium :)
2010-09-06T23:47:00.000Z	Grappleseed	ActionParsnip	what's that?
2010-09-06T23:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Grappleseed	its the open source version which chrome is based on
2010-09-06T23:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Grappleseed	its in the repo now. There's also a daily build ppa if you want bleeding edge
2010-09-06T23:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Grappleseed	you could use a download helper like uget
2010-09-06T23:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Grappleseed	bleeding edge means compiled very recently
2010-09-06T23:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Grappleseed	ppa and repo are just names for the servers you download stuff from in software centre
2010-09-06T23:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Grappleseed	the official ones are called repositorys, or repos for short. If you add 3rd party servers to download from they will be ppas or personal package archives
2010-09-06T23:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Grappleseed	every day is a school day :)
2010-09-06T23:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Grappleseed	we can only advise you. Technically its their responsibility to keep you out ;)
2010-09-06T23:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Grappleseed	pretty much sums it up :). Like it
2010-09-06T23:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Grappleseed	just read. Its not hard :)
2010-09-07T00:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Grappleseed	as you use the OS you will learn, the same you did with the other OSes
