2006-01-27T07:53:00.000Z	Kleggas	tatters	well, why do you delete something you have no idea what it is?
2006-01-27T07:54:00.000Z	Kleggas	tatters	what application?
2006-01-27T07:55:00.000Z	Kleggas	tatters	they are all in apt repositories
2006-01-27T07:59:00.000Z	Kleggas	tatters	never heard of mysql-snort.... but what you are trying to do, basically, is to install mysql and apache to work together?
2006-01-27T08:05:00.000Z	Kleggas	tatters	none
2006-01-27T08:11:00.000Z	Kleggas	tatters	best way of restoring any os is to make a ghost image of it
2006-01-27T08:13:00.000Z	Kleggas	tatters	which ghost you talk about? norton? and a ghost images makes a copy of whatever is on the disk, shouldn't care about OS
2006-01-27T08:14:00.000Z	Kleggas	tatters	np. you could also check out the dd command in linux ;)
2006-01-27T08:18:00.000Z	Kleggas	tatters	use whatever you feel works. as you said before, you are new to linux, so use windows for ghosting if you allready know how
