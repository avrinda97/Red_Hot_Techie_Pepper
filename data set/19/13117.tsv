2005-05-22T12:33:00.000Z	ivoks	Flav	changelog of package
2005-05-22T12:34:00.000Z	ivoks	Flav	go to /usr/share/doc/libgnutls11/
2005-05-22T12:34:00.000Z	ivoks	Flav	and checkout changelo
2005-05-22T12:34:00.000Z	ivoks	Flav	and checkout changelog
2005-05-22T12:35:00.000Z	Flav	ivoks	cool, thanks - i was kind of hoping for something like http://security.debian.org/ with an online listing, but the changelog works nicely
2005-05-22T12:35:00.000Z	ivoks	Flav	all packages have changelogs
2005-05-22T12:35:00.000Z	ivoks	Flav	changelog.Debian.gz is the one you need
2005-05-22T12:36:00.000Z	Flav	ivoks	right, but i have to install the update to see that changelog, right?  an online one makes it easier to tell whether i need to install the package or not
2005-05-22T12:36:00.000Z	ivoks	Flav	true
2005-05-22T12:36:00.000Z	Flav	ivoks	yeah, the fix is for CAN-2005-1431
2005-05-22T12:39:00.000Z	ivoks	Flav	you can subscribe to bugtraq
2005-05-22T12:39:00.000Z	ivoks	Flav	you'll get changes mailed to you :)
2005-05-22T12:39:00.000Z	Flav	ivoks	unsub'd from that quite awhile back, too much noise relative to the small set of things i care about :)
2005-05-22T12:40:00.000Z	ivoks	Flav	filter it
2005-05-22T12:40:00.000Z	ivoks	Flav	you can choose what mails you want
2005-05-22T12:40:00.000Z	ivoks	Flav	not quite
2005-05-22T12:45:00.000Z	Flav	ivoks	notice he said "I know i'm not supposed to use breezy yet"
2005-05-22T12:45:00.000Z	ivoks	Flav	:)
