2011-01-11T22:07:00.000Z	zteam		Hi
2011-01-11T22:09:00.000Z	zteam		Can somebody here please tell me how to troubleshoot a floopy disc issue??
2011-01-11T22:11:00.000Z	zteam		Abhijit: yes, a floppy disc issue, I need to update my BIOS and I have no USB-stick to use either, so I need to use a floppy
2011-01-11T22:11:00.000Z	AbhiJit	zteam	details please
2011-01-11T22:13:00.000Z	zteam	AbhiJit	Well, like I said, I need to update my BIOS on a Ubuntu-machine and I have no USB-stick avaible
2011-01-11T22:14:00.000Z	AbhiJit	zteam	no i mean whats wrong with that floppy drive? does it not recognized etc?
2011-01-11T22:14:00.000Z	AbhiJit	zteam	yah see what compdoc says
2011-01-11T22:16:00.000Z	zteam	AbhiJit	The floppy drive works perfectly, and is enabled in BIOS, and I can format it in Ubuntu too
2011-01-11T22:16:00.000Z	AbhiJit	zteam	then where is there is the actual problem? i am discribe the problem so if i or anyone knows then they can help you
2011-01-11T22:20:00.000Z	zteam	AbhiJit	The strange thing is that It can't seem to write to it, I have mounted it, and checked my permissions for the mount point, and it seems to be OK, BUT the files is written to the folder (the mountpoint)  and not to the floppy drive itself
2011-01-11T22:21:00.000Z	AbhiJit	zteam	so you are trying it from inside ubuntu? i suggest you to get that freedos i.e. bootable dos insert cd run that dos and from then try to update bios using floppy
2011-01-11T22:21:00.000Z	AbhiJit	zteam	is it laptop?
2011-01-11T22:23:00.000Z	zteam	AbhiJit	Yes, I have tried it from inside Ubuntu and no it's not a laptop :-)
2011-01-11T22:23:00.000Z	AbhiJit	zteam	ok then try from bootable dos in cd
2011-01-11T22:24:00.000Z	AbhiJit	zteam	you may ask in ##windows too
2011-01-11T22:24:00.000Z	AbhiJit	zteam	in my case its laptop so hp only gives bios update in .exe format so i need to must go to windows to update it. :'(
2011-01-11T22:24:00.000Z	zteam	AbhiJit	Yes it seems that may be the only easy way to solve it...
2011-01-11T22:27:00.000Z	zteam	AbhiJit	Well, I have used Windows for about 10-15 years myself so I do know how dos works pretty well :-)
2011-01-11T22:27:00.000Z	AbhiJit	zteam	yah :)
