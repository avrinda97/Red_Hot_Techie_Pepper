2008-12-20T01:02:00.000Z	Scunizi_	_Bluey__	are you using virtual box?
2008-12-20T01:03:00.000Z	_Bluey__	Scunizi_	yes
2008-12-20T01:03:00.000Z	_Bluey__	Scunizi_	sun xvm virtualbox ver 2.0.6
2008-12-20T01:04:00.000Z	Scunizi_	_Bluey__	at the bottom right of the windows vm window you'll see some icons. the one that looks like a "usb plug" click that and see if your ipod is listed there
2008-12-20T01:04:00.000Z	_Bluey__	Scunizi_	it is listed but its greyed out
2008-12-20T01:04:00.000Z	Scunizi_	_Bluey__	are you a member of the vbox group?
2008-12-20T01:05:00.000Z	_Bluey__	Scunizi_	how do i check that?
2008-12-20T01:05:00.000Z	Scunizi_	_Bluey__	System>Admin>Group>virtual box
2008-12-20T01:07:00.000Z	Scunizi_	_Bluey__	you also need to add the following line in /etc/fstab.. none /proc/bus/usb usbfs devgid=125,devmode=664 0 0
2008-12-20T01:07:00.000Z	_Bluey__	Scunizi_	there was only 2 things "root" and "bluey" in the properties box. i ticked against bluey and saved
2008-12-20T01:07:00.000Z	Scunizi_	_Bluey__	then in a terminal type ... grep vboxusers /etc/group to get the righ devgid number to put in that line in fstab
2008-12-20T01:07:00.000Z	_Bluey__	Scunizi_	i have done the ftab part
2008-12-20T01:09:00.000Z	Scunizi_	_Bluey__	ASULutzy sometimes you have to reboot.. went round and round trying to restart the right systems yesterday with someone and nothing worked until reboot
2008-12-20T01:17:00.000Z	Scunizi_	_Bluey__	you might want to head over to #vbox.. they are pretty helpful there and might be able to diagnose what's going on.
2008-12-20T01:18:00.000Z	_Bluey__	Scunizi_	ASULutzy : thank you i will try my luck at #vbox
2008-12-20T01:18:00.000Z	Scunizi_	_Bluey__	wait.. are you using the version from vbox or the repos?
2008-12-20T01:19:00.000Z	_Bluey__	Scunizi_	vbox
2008-12-20T01:19:00.000Z	Scunizi_	_Bluey__	thanks.. didn't know.
