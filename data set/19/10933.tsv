2006-06-17T05:59:00.000Z	eric__		ok, still cant install and run any program
2006-06-17T05:59:00.000Z	eric__		says i need to rename real player on desktop to install
2006-06-17T06:00:00.000Z	eric__		can change it b/c there is a "/" in the name
2006-06-17T06:00:00.000Z	Warbo	eric__	There is a repo for realplayer which I use
2006-06-17T06:01:00.000Z	Warbo	eric__	In Synaptic go on Settings>Repositories and Add then Custom and put "deb ftp://ftp.nerim.net/debian-marillat/ sarge main"
2006-06-17T06:07:00.000Z	Warbo	eric__	System > Administration > Synaptic Package Manager (how everything should be installed)
2006-06-17T06:09:00.000Z	Warbo	eric__	Just search for whatever you want in Synaptic and mark it for installation then apply the changes. If something is not in Ubuntu (like realplayer) then add a new repository (like the one I gave you)
2006-06-17T06:17:00.000Z	Warbo	eric__	Click the little writing thing at the top left of the screen which says "System" and some more writing will magically appear. Put the little arrow thing over "Administration" and more magical writing. Now click on Synaptic Package Manager. Put in your password (your normal user's password) then when it comes up click on "Settings" at the top (more magical writing) then "Repositories", now "Add" and there is a little b
2006-06-17T06:21:00.000Z	Warbo	eric__	? I think those instructions (apart from 3 typos) are pretty easy to follow
2006-06-17T06:23:00.000Z	Warbo	eric__	I wrote that explanation about as dumb as I could make it (the little arrow thing is your mouse pointer if that is confusing you)
2006-06-17T06:34:00.000Z	Warbo	eric__	deb ftp://ftp.nerim.net/debian-marillat/ sarge main
2006-06-17T06:35:00.000Z	Warbo	eric__	Hit "reload" in Synaptic then search for realplayer
2006-06-17T06:36:00.000Z	Warbo	eric__	That's OK
2006-06-17T06:37:00.000Z	Warbo	eric__	(I keep it disabled after installing what I want from it anyway. That stops the error)
2006-06-17T06:40:00.000Z	Warbo	eric__	No problem. You may want to disable that repository now to stop the GPG warning (just untick the box next to it in Settings>Repositories) but I also use it for flashplayer
2006-06-17T06:50:00.000Z	Warbo	eric__	There is a list of repositories (Apper LTS should be at the top) and on their left should be tick boxes
2006-06-17T06:50:00.000Z	Warbo	eric__	In Synaptic's Settings>Repositories
2006-06-17T06:53:00.000Z	Warbo	eric__	OK, well never mind. (if you run "sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list" and go down to the line with nerim.net in it and put a "#" at the beginning of that line, then press ctrl-x, y then enter to save it you will have done the same thing)
2006-06-17T06:54:00.000Z	Warbo	eric__	OK, np
