2010-03-01T01:31:00.000Z	nytek_	aliciapg	is it the correct device name?
2010-03-01T01:31:00.000Z	aliciapg	nytek_	what do you mean by the correct device name? it's probably not
2010-03-01T01:32:00.000Z	aliciapg	nytek_	i just don't know what to change it to
2010-03-01T01:33:00.000Z	nytek_	aliciapg	go into you /dev/ and look for "video0"
2010-03-01T01:33:00.000Z	aliciapg	nytek_	yeah that doesn't exist
