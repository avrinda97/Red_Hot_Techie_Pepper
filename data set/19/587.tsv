2011-12-09T11:05:00.000Z	mohammadtiti		I just downloaded Ubuntu 11.10. When trying to install it, surprisingly I saw that it didn't detect my Windows 7 HP SP1.what should i do to not harming my windows and having ubuntu?
2011-12-09T11:06:00.000Z	dr_willis	mohammadtiti	 ive seen windows systems with 4 primary partions confuse the installer
2011-12-09T11:06:00.000Z	dr_willis	mohammadtiti	 you cant even do an install correct?
2011-12-09T11:09:00.000Z	dr_willis	mohammadtiti	 pastebin your sudo fdisk -l     output
2011-12-09T11:12:00.000Z	dr_willis	mohammadtiti	 make a restore dvd set for your hp. :-)
2011-12-09T11:26:00.000Z	dr_willis	mohammadtiti	 the installer is not seeing your hd?
2011-12-09T11:28:00.000Z	mohammadtiti	dr_willis	the installed is seeing my hd, but not my windows partition. it doesn't detect that i have windows 7 HP SP1 preinstalled
2011-12-09T11:29:00.000Z	dr_willis	mohammadtiti	  clarify what 'not seeing it' means...
2011-12-09T11:29:00.000Z	dr_willis	mohammadtiti	 cant access the data? grub not adding an entry for it?
2011-12-09T11:31:00.000Z	mohammadtiti	dr_willis	my problem is:when trying to install ubuntu, it does detect my hd. But it doesn't detect my windows. in the installation procedure there come a window saying installing alongside windows or repartitioning the whole disk
2011-12-09T11:33:00.000Z	dr_willis	mohammadtiti	  if you have 4 primary partitions on the hd to begin with .. the installer will stop. it must be able to make more partitions... so... pastebin the output of  'sudo fdisk -l' for us to look at . to verify if this is the issue
2011-12-09T11:33:00.000Z	mohammadtiti	dr_willis	i just booted the live dvd, I can access my windows data and its contents. But as I told u before i didn't dare installing it
2011-12-09T11:34:00.000Z	mohammadtiti	dr_willis	you mean I have to type that phrase in the terminal
2011-12-09T12:00:00.000Z	mohammadtiti	dr_willis	u there?
2011-12-09T12:02:00.000Z	mohammadtiti	dr_willis	i did what u told me
2011-12-09T12:07:00.000Z	dr_willis	mohammadtiti	 ive no idea what you were doing with that.. all you needed to do from the live cd was run 2 commands..and pastw the url it gives  here
2011-12-09T12:10:00.000Z	dr_willis	mohammadtiti	 i did..... ;) several times
