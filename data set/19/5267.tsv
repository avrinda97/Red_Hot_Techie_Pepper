2009-09-13T09:23:00.000Z	lstarnes	scott___	which ISP are you using?
2009-09-13T09:24:00.000Z	lstarnes	scott___	it might be possible that your ISP is blocking port 80
2009-09-13T09:24:00.000Z	lstarnes	scott___	your webserver may also be misconfigured
2009-09-13T09:25:00.000Z	scott___	lstarnes	how does apache listen for traffic
2009-09-13T09:25:00.000Z	lstarnes	scott___	it usually binds to port 80 if possible then listens
2009-09-13T09:26:00.000Z	lstarnes	scott___	try checking /etc/apache2/ports.conf
2009-09-13T09:30:00.000Z	lstarnes	scott___	from its local IP?
2009-09-13T09:30:00.000Z	lstarnes	scott___	have you tried 127.0.0.1?
2009-09-13T09:30:00.000Z	lstarnes	scott___	it works locally, right?
2009-09-13T09:30:00.000Z	lstarnes	scott___	and you set your router to forward it?
2009-09-13T09:31:00.000Z	lstarnes	scott___	does it work with the LAN ip in telnet?
2009-09-13T09:32:00.000Z	lstarnes	scott___	then it may be your ISP blocking it
2009-09-13T09:32:00.000Z	lstarnes	scott___	your ISP must do that
2009-09-13T09:33:00.000Z	lstarnes	scott___	it may be against its terms of service to do so
2009-09-13T09:33:00.000Z	lstarnes	scott___	you could try 8080
2009-09-13T09:37:00.000Z	lstarnes	scott___	you could forward 8080 on the router to 80 on your LAN IP
