2010-07-24T01:58:00.000Z	BCMM		i'm trying to update a friend's system which is way out of date (hardy), and am running into problems
2010-07-24T01:58:00.000Z	BCMM		i've tried apt-get install -f, and get "package is in very bad inconsistent state" and so on for flashplugin
2010-07-24T01:59:00.000Z	BCMM		how can i fix that?
2010-07-24T02:00:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	BCMM	pastebin command and all output
2010-07-24T02:14:00.000Z	BCMM	ilovefairuz	http://pastebin.org/413774
2010-07-24T02:16:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	BCMM	apt-get install --reinstall flashplugin-nonfree
2010-07-24T02:23:00.000Z	BCMM	ilovefairuz	"flashplugin-nonfree: Depends: flashplugin-installer but it is not going to be installed"
2010-07-24T02:24:00.000Z	BCMM	ilovefairuz	i should say the first error was "you have held broken packages" while trying to do a dist upgrade
2010-07-24T02:30:00.000Z	BCMM	ilovefairuz	should i just do a clean install or what?
2010-07-24T02:31:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	BCMM	try sudo apt-get install --reinstall -f Â flashplugin-installer flashplugin-nonfree libasound2-plugins
2010-07-24T02:51:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	BCMM	did you try the last command i gave you ?
2010-07-24T02:52:00.000Z	BCMM	ilovefairuz	oh, sorry - for some reason i don't highlight on bcmm_
2010-07-24T02:52:00.000Z	BCMM	ilovefairuz	now i just have the "held broken packages" thing, but i don't know how to list my held packages
2010-07-24T02:53:00.000Z	BCMM	ilovefairuz	that command seemed to help, it's running now
2010-07-24T02:54:00.000Z	BCMM	ilovefairuz	and then "held broken packages" again
2010-07-24T02:54:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	BCMM	pastebin
2010-07-24T03:00:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	BCMM	dpkg --configure -a
2010-07-24T03:04:00.000Z	BCMM	ilovefairuz	would the log file help?
2010-07-24T03:04:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	BCMM	apt-get autoremove flashplugin-nonfree
