2010-03-29T07:31:00.000Z	LinuX2half		I'm wondering why does ubuntu remove some of my packages when I'm remove only specific packages.
2010-03-29T07:32:00.000Z	LinuX2half		Like for example, when I try to remove a package, the system would also remove additional packages? Why is that?

2010-03-29T07:35:00.000Z	LinuX2half		Oh, so its an dependency matter. Alright but when I remove those following package: gvfs gvfs-backends gvfs-bin gvfs-fuse libgvfscommon0 ifuse libgpod-dev  libgpod-common libiphone-utils, it removed some of my panel's applications?
2010-03-29T07:36:00.000Z	LinuX2half		it removed my usb creator and docs
2010-03-29T07:36:00.000Z	LinuX2half		there are numerous others that they also had removed
2010-03-29T07:37:00.000Z	LinuX2half	Trek	Really, I thought they aren't related
2010-03-29T07:38:00.000Z	LinuX2half	Trek	Alright, thanks I thought it might be a major issue...
2010-03-29T07:42:00.000Z	LinuX2half		See ya

2010-03-29T07:57:00.000Z	LinuX2half		Now, the whole desktop has gone
2010-03-29T07:57:00.000Z	LinuX2half		The panel disappeared.

2010-03-29T08:00:00.000Z	LinuX2half		I'm having trouble with my desktop
2010-03-29T08:01:00.000Z	LinuX2half		The apnel is gone
2010-03-29T08:01:00.000Z	LinuX2half		It seemed that the terminal had removed all the related packages, resulting in an error
