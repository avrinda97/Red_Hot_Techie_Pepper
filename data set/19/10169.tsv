2007-01-23T07:59:00.000Z	Tonren	eternalswd	I might change it over
2007-01-23T07:53:00.000Z	eternalswd	Tonren	upload slots are how many clients you're willing to seed to
2007-01-23T07:53:00.000Z	Tonren	eternalswd	Hmm... it's only four.  Maybe that's what's going on.
2007-01-23T07:54:00.000Z	Tonren	eternalswd	Is it a bad idea to have no upload slot limit on a commercial router?
2007-01-23T07:54:00.000Z	eternalswd	Tonren	doesn't depend on router, depends on connection speed.
2007-01-23T07:54:00.000Z	Tonren	eternalswd	Sorry, I meant commercial cable modem, not router
2007-01-23T07:57:00.000Z	Tonren	eternalswd	Shields Up got it, btw
2007-01-23T07:57:00.000Z	eternalswd	Tonren	shouldn't need to limit it unless you need upload bandwidth somewhere else.  Unlimited though can limit the speed of websurfing.
2007-01-23T07:57:00.000Z	Tonren	eternalswd	hmm
2007-01-23T07:58:00.000Z	eternalswd	Tonren	I usually use 30000+ port numbers to avoid conflicts
2007-01-23T07:59:00.000Z	eternalswd	Tonren	do you have encryption enabled on the packets?
2007-01-23T07:59:00.000Z	Tonren	eternalswd	I dunno.  I don't think so
2007-01-23T07:59:00.000Z	Tonren	eternalswd	No, it's not enabled
2007-01-23T08:00:00.000Z	Tonren	eternalswd	Maybe the seeders are on filtered/proxied/packet-shaped connections, and the connection packet gets through but the data packets aren't?
2007-01-23T08:00:00.000Z	eternalswd	Tonren	depending on the swarm, that could be it.  Always enable encryption, but use the fallback.
2007-01-23T08:00:00.000Z	Tonren	eternalswd	In other words, enable encryption, but also allow unencrypted connections.
2007-01-23T08:00:00.000Z	eternalswd	Tonren	exactly
2007-01-23T08:00:00.000Z	Tonren	eternalswd	OK, I just enabled encryption
2007-01-23T08:02:00.000Z	eternalswd	Tonren	it is possible to have seeders that cut their bandwidth while seeding even to the point of being bytes per second, but that shouldn't apply accross the board
