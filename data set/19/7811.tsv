2010-09-02T12:15:00.000Z	illmortal		can someone assist me in trying to re-install grub... I installed ubuntu 10.04 onto the same SSD that my Windows 7 is on, but on a 2nd partition, and grub didn't install or at least it looked like it installed but after reboot, only windows loads up, don't get a dual boot option

2010-09-02T12:17:00.000Z	Jordan_U	illmortal	Though re-reading your comment I think you just let the Ubuntu installer do what it does automatically, which is in fact to install to the mbr.
2010-09-02T12:22:00.000Z	Jordan_U	illmortal	No, definitely not (that would make windows unbootable). Install grub to sdb, not to any partitions like sdb1.
2010-09-02T12:24:00.000Z	Jordan_U	illmortal	Unfortunately it seems to have installed to the *wrong* mbr (probably to the mbr of another drive). To fix this follow this guide: http://grub.enbug.org/Grub2LiveCdInstallGuide but instead of running grub-install run "dpkg-reconfigure grub-pc".
2011-03-13T07:45:00.000Z	Jordan_U	illmortal	OK, that most likely means that at some point you accidentily installed grub to your windows partition (in the future remember *never* install grub to a partition's boot sector).
2011-03-13T07:45:00.000Z	Jordan_U	illmortal	Can you run boot info script as explained here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1291280 and pastebin the RESULTS.txt ?
2011-03-13T07:46:00.000Z	Jordan_U	illmortal	If that is the problem it's fairly easy to recover.
2011-03-13T08:11:00.000Z	illmortal	Jordan_U	looks like I needed to install the MBR onto /dev/sdd not /dev/sda?
2011-03-13T08:13:00.000Z	Jordan_U	illmortal	I haven't been able to see your paste, the page keeps loading a completely blank box where it should be. Could you try using pastebin.ubuntu.com instead?

2011-03-13T08:17:00.000Z	Jordan_U	illmortal	Wow, that's a lot of disks.
2011-03-13T08:17:00.000Z	illmortal	Jordan_U	^
2011-03-13T08:19:00.000Z	Jordan_U	illmortal	According to that output you don't have any Wubi install.
2011-03-13T08:19:00.000Z	illmortal	Jordan_U	o.o; I'm pretty sure that's how I installed it.. but then again I could be thinking of this laptop, assuming I did the same to my desktop =X
2011-03-13T08:20:00.000Z	illmortal	Jordan_U	how do we go about fixing this issue if it's not installed via Wubi, rather on it's own partition? (sdd2)
2011-03-13T08:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U	illmortal	Follow this guide: http://grub.enbug.org/Grub2LiveCdInstallGuide
2011-03-13T08:23:00.000Z	Jordan_U	illmortal	When you are booted into Ubuntu again run "sudo dpkg-reconfigure grub-pc" and select sdd as an install device for grub (and make sure *no* partitions are selected). This is an important step as it will prevent this problem from occuring again.
2011-03-13T08:23:00.000Z	Jordan_U	illmortal	You're welcome.
