2012-01-31T14:06:00.000Z	JadedJacob		sweet, that's exactly what I want!
2012-01-31T14:07:00.000Z	JadedJacob		my BIOS doesn't have an option to boot off USB, can I install GRUB onto my harddrive and boot the flashdrive from there?
2012-01-31T14:08:00.000Z	JadedJacob		Yep.
2012-01-31T14:08:00.000Z	[deXter]	JadedJacob	you can configure grub to boot PLOP, which can then boot your flash drive. You could configure gurb to boot the USB but it's not straightforward.

2012-01-31T14:11:00.000Z	JadedJacob	[deXter]	thanks
2012-01-31T14:13:00.000Z	[deXter]	JadedJacob	re. that link, you might want to refer to the "GRUB2" section instead of the GRUB1 I accidentally linked you to :)
2012-01-31T14:14:00.000Z	[deXter]	JadedJacob	ah, well I suggest you go with GRUB4DOS then, it's simpler and more flexible
2012-01-31T14:15:00.000Z	[deXter]	JadedJacob	it can be installed onto a FAT or NTFS partition too
2012-01-31T14:17:00.000Z	[deXter]	JadedJacob	Those instructions assume an existing Linux install... what's on your system right now?
2012-01-31T14:19:00.000Z	[deXter]	JadedJacob	Do you really want to go ahead with this though? Booting and running a full fledged distro via USB 1.1 is *painfully* slow
2012-01-31T14:20:00.000Z	JadedJacob	[deXter]	I have a USB 2.0 PCI card :D
2012-01-31T14:20:00.000Z	[deXter]	JadedJacob	I would suggest going with a lightweight distro optimised for older machines. Newer distros pack the newer kernel which is bloated and optimised for newer processors.
2012-01-31T14:20:00.000Z	[deXter]	JadedJacob	 ah that's awesome.
2012-01-31T14:21:00.000Z	[deXter]	JadedJacob	In that case I would recommend a Puppy Linux based distro, like Turbo Puppy
2012-01-31T14:22:00.000Z	[deXter]	JadedJacob	Turbopup uses like 10 MB of RAM.. yes, that's 10 MB.. not 100+ like any modern distro. http://www.murga-linux.com/puppy/viewtopic.php?t=40477
2012-01-31T14:30:00.000Z	JadedJacob	[deXter]	that link you sent me is Turbopup EXTREME
2012-01-31T14:30:00.000Z	[deXter]	JadedJacob	Yep, you need all the speed you can get ;)
2012-01-31T14:40:00.000Z	[deXter]	JadedJacob	I've run it on many old machines without any issues
