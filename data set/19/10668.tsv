2006-05-27T13:44:00.000Z	achandra		HELLO...what do I need to get the kernel-sources kernel-headers for my kernel?? its not custom..just the basic one
2006-05-27T13:45:00.000Z	achandra		for breezy..
2006-05-27T13:45:00.000Z	apokryphos	achandra	sudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r)
2006-05-27T13:46:00.000Z	achandra	apokryphos	do i need to set up the extra sites in repo?
2006-05-27T13:46:00.000Z	apokryphos	achandra	extra repos on the site, do you mean? Nope, kernel headers are in main
2006-05-27T13:47:00.000Z	achandra	apokryphos	yes...lol..im new to the repo concept...used to be an rpm guy....lol...how to ask properly??
2006-05-27T13:48:00.000Z	apokryphos	achandra	just replace all thoughts of "source" with "repository" 8)
2006-05-27T13:49:00.000Z	achandra	apokryphos	makes sense...nice explanation..
2006-05-27T13:49:00.000Z	apokryphos	achandra	after that it's just a case of learning the different options; rpm and .debs aren't all that different, it's just the options that change.
2006-05-27T13:50:00.000Z	achandra	apokryphos	never really loved rpms..really...certain rpm packaging..makes you friend of the find command..beacuse of where "they" think things should be installed..what a mess..no distro is the same..
2006-05-27T13:51:00.000Z	apokryphos	achandra	my guess is the problem probably wasn't down to rpm at all itself, but more the organisation of the distribution
2006-05-27T13:52:00.000Z	achandra	apokryphos	agreed.. ...dealt with that on MDK, and suse...a mess.
2006-05-27T13:53:00.000Z	apokryphos	achandra	I haven't tried Mandrake since 10, but I'm a big-ish aficionado of suse; their organisation *is* quite good, really ;-)
2006-05-27T13:55:00.000Z	achandra	apokryphos	In trying to compile some I get this error - gcc-3.4: command not found any ideas.?
2006-05-27T13:56:00.000Z	apokryphos	achandra	just means you don't have gcc 3.4 which you're looking for
2006-05-27T13:56:00.000Z	achandra	apokryphos	how to get it??
2006-05-27T13:57:00.000Z	apokryphos	achandra	it's in the ubuntu repositories
2006-05-27T13:57:00.000Z	achandra	apokryphos	is it simply aptget install gcc or gcc-3.4?
2006-06-20T16:47:00.000Z	apokryphos	achandra	damn! Maybe there was a --help page?
