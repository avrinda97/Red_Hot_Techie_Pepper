2008-05-09T23:53:00.000Z	SliM1		please, i really need my ubuntu to work
2008-05-09T23:53:00.000Z	spiderfire	SliM1	whats up?
2008-05-09T23:54:00.000Z	SliM1	spiderfire	 http://paste.ubuntu.com/11158/
2008-05-09T23:54:00.000Z	SliM1	spiderfire	after a failed visual (network) upgrade
2008-05-09T23:55:00.000Z	SliM1	spiderfire	and after a command-line upgrade (dial-up connection!) which also failed generating that error
2008-05-09T23:55:00.000Z	spiderfire	SliM1	well i would first remove gnome-screensaver
2008-05-09T23:56:00.000Z	SliM1	spiderfire	but i at least have the packages cached, after 12 hours of waiting
2008-05-09T23:57:00.000Z	spiderfire	SliM1	but you can probably just uninstall gnome-screensaver and then that theme
2008-05-09T23:57:00.000Z	SliM1	spiderfire	oh, i have just tried: i cannot remove it unless i have solved the problem
2008-05-09T23:59:00.000Z	SliM1	spiderfire	what next? :)
2008-05-10T00:00:00.000Z	spiderfire	SliM1	is this hardy and are the packages from the repo?
2008-05-10T00:01:00.000Z	SliM1	spiderfire	it's somewhere between hardy and gutsy, closer to gutsy, due to a failed upgrade, and the packages are indeed from the repo
2008-05-10T00:02:00.000Z	spiderfire	SliM1	are all your apt sources set to hardy?
2008-05-10T00:03:00.000Z	SliM1	spiderfire	this, i do not know, but i think sow; the "software sources" application isn't working
2008-05-10T00:04:00.000Z	spiderfire	SliM1	i dont know, try sudo update-manager -d?
2008-05-10T00:05:00.000Z	SliM1	spiderfire	hmm, "software index is broken" suggestions: synaptic/'sudo apt-get -f install'
2008-05-10T00:13:00.000Z	SliM1	spiderfire	maybe another idea?
2008-05-10T00:13:00.000Z	spiderfire	SliM1	 im stumped
2008-05-10T00:14:00.000Z	SliM1	spiderfire	so am i
