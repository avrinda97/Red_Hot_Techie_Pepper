2006-04-23T16:35:00.000Z	gymsmoke	arrick	if you're running Ubuntu as a server, you definitely do not need a gui to run web sites
2006-04-23T16:36:00.000Z	arrick	gymsmoke	I know, but I cant find the info to run the blasted multiple sites, as I just said a minute ago
2006-04-23T16:36:00.000Z	gymsmoke	arrick	are you running your own dns?
2006-04-23T16:37:00.000Z	gymsmoke	arrick	do you have more than 1 static IP address?
2006-04-23T16:37:00.000Z	arrick	gymsmoke	Ive been in here for 10 hours so far and no help on this topic here
2006-04-23T16:37:00.000Z	gymsmoke	arrick	are you familiar with setting up virtual hosts in apache?
2006-04-23T16:38:00.000Z	arrick	gymsmoke	thats where I cant find a tutorial that has the correct commands in it
2006-04-23T16:38:00.000Z	gymsmoke	arrick	there's tut's out there for it... lemme see if i can grab one for you
2006-04-23T16:38:00.000Z	arrick	gymsmoke	I even spent $32 on a apache2 book, and it doesnt even have the correct commands in it.
2006-04-23T16:39:00.000Z	gymsmoke	arrick	"correct" commands??
2006-04-23T16:39:00.000Z	arrick	gymsmoke	no correct locations, or any of that sort of stuff
2006-04-23T16:40:00.000Z	gymsmoke	arrick	http://www.netahoy.org/tutorials/apache2.htm
2006-04-23T16:43:00.000Z	gymsmoke	arrick	ok, one more -- http://community.unixcities.com/node/9
2006-04-23T16:53:00.000Z	arrick	gymsmoke	duelboot, DBO why do all the tutorials reference NameVirtualHost when there is not one in apache?, am I supposed to create this somewhere, as they give no directory referenced
2006-04-23T16:54:00.000Z	gymsmoke	arrick	you have to set up NameVirtualHost in the apache conf file...
2006-04-23T16:56:00.000Z	gymsmoke	arrick	there's also an example file in apache that (i think) shows both ip and non-ip based setups
2006-04-23T16:57:00.000Z	arrick	gymsmoke	not from what I see, in the examples folder
2006-04-28T08:37:00.000Z	arrick	gymsmoke	good job
2006-04-28T08:37:00.000Z	gymsmoke	arrick	a couple of tweaks left (like, how to just dump mail that is marked "SPAM"...
