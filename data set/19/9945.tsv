2007-01-11T10:45:00.000Z	AdamKrier		Hello. I was wondering why jpg's do not open when you double click on them (in fact they bring up a warning) but jpeg's do work correctly. Also, how can i fix it for jpg's
2007-01-11T10:46:00.000Z	AdamKrier		I was wondering if anyone could tell me how to get gThumb or EoG to work with .jpg instead of just .jpeg
2007-01-11T10:47:00.000Z	AdamKrier		i have >200 images from a trip and i don't want to rename ALL of them
2007-01-11T10:47:00.000Z	EnsignRedshirt	AdamKrier	Actually, it would not be difficult to rename all of them--but you shouldn't have to.
2007-01-11T10:48:00.000Z	AdamKrier	EnsignRedshirt	how can i avoid it -- in EoG and gThumb it just looks as if the 200 some odd pictures do not even exist because of the .jpg... If i rename some to .jpeg they show up
2007-01-11T10:49:00.000Z	EnsignRedshirt	AdamKrier	Sorry, I don't know the answer to your question, but I agree that the apps should recognize the .jpg extension.
2007-01-11T10:50:00.000Z	AdamKrier	EnsignRedshirt	how would you rename them all easily?
2007-01-11T10:52:00.000Z	EnsignRedshirt	AdamKrier	rename 's/\.jpg$/.jpeg/'  *.jpg
2007-01-11T10:54:00.000Z	AdamKrier	EnsignRedshirt	thanks man i will try that
2007-01-11T10:54:00.000Z	EnsignRedshirt	AdamKrier	If you're nervous, you should create a few .jpg files in /tmp and test it first.
2007-01-11T10:56:00.000Z	AdamKrier	EnsignRedshirt	i made a copy of the image folder  cuz i was nervous actually :-) trying it now
2007-01-11T10:56:00.000Z	EnsignRedshirt	AdamKrier	Smart man ;)
2007-01-11T10:57:00.000Z	AdamKrier	EnsignRedshirt	can you send that command again? i lost it when liek a million ppl signed off and on of the channel
2007-01-11T10:57:00.000Z	AdamKrier	EnsignRedshirt	 sorry :-/
2007-01-11T10:57:00.000Z	EnsignRedshirt	AdamKrier	rename 's/.jpg$/.jpeg/'  *.jpg
2007-01-11T10:58:00.000Z	EnsignRedshirt	AdamKrier	Wait...
2007-01-11T10:58:00.000Z	EnsignRedshirt	AdamKrier	rename 's/\.jpg$/.jpeg/'  *.jpg
2007-01-11T11:03:00.000Z	EnsignRedshirt	AdamKrier	no problem
2007-01-11T11:03:00.000Z	AdamKrier	EnsignRedshirt	I'm still pissssssed that shit doesn't work with .jpgs though, but this will do :-D
