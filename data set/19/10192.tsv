2006-09-20T14:27:00.000Z	boink		both are good
2006-09-20T14:28:00.000Z	boink		it's like comparing apples and oranges
2006-09-20T14:28:00.000Z	boink		for some, they prefer fedora .. for some, they prefer ubuntu
2006-09-20T14:28:00.000Z	boink		and some prefer pain, and use debian sid
2006-09-20T14:29:00.000Z	boink		try both and see which one you like
2006-09-20T14:29:00.000Z	boink		rpm now have yum, which works much like apt-get
2006-09-20T14:29:00.000Z	boink		sometimes apt-get can sux too
2006-09-20T14:30:00.000Z	boink		nothing is perfect in an imperfect world :P
2006-09-20T14:30:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	boink	then use YUM
2006-09-23T12:32:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	boink	it would be pointless
2006-09-23T12:32:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	boink	i agree
2006-09-23T12:33:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	boink	i tried once to make a cd repo from all the debs on my system and it failed miserably
2006-09-23T12:34:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	boink	i think by the time they produce the cd with the debs they would all be out of date
2006-09-23T12:35:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	boink	whats the httpd.conf?
2006-09-23T12:36:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	boink	i added the cd via the software management dialogue... i also tried the dpkg -i -get-selections- method
2006-10-17T11:51:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	boink	want to do it the automated way as in add mp3s to cd playlist for burning the let it convert and burm them...ala Windows Media Player
2006-10-17T11:54:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	boink	you are missing the point I got a library of 1000s of mp3s so no good using a cd ripper at this point
2006-10-17T11:57:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	boink	xmms pulls down the appropriate codecs when you install it
2006-10-17T11:57:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	boink	although it would not be playing them from default install this would be illegal and ubuntu would not exist anymore
