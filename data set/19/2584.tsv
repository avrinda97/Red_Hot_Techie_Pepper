2010-03-02T10:25:00.000Z	LaPrinj		I installed Ubuntu for the first time today on my family computer. I've never used Linux, but always knew that it's not prone to viruses at all like Windows and this computer's close to death (parents/sister kept doing things which caused viruses to load and caused a lot of damage). I got this working, and mostly got the hang of it, except I messed up the video. I tried installing EnvyNG and attempted at installing an unrecommended version o
2010-03-02T10:26:00.000Z	LaPrinj		I hope that description provides as much insight as possible.
2010-03-02T10:27:00.000Z	brjann	LaPrinj	your description cut off after "installing an unrecommended version"
2010-03-02T10:29:00.000Z	brjann	LaPrinj	since troubleshooting video can be such a pain, if it were my computer and I'd just installed ubuntu today, i would reinstall :)
2010-03-02T10:32:00.000Z	brjann	LaPrinj	did you try the xserver-xorg-video-radeonhd driver?
2010-03-02T10:33:00.000Z	brjann	LaPrinj	that's the one which lists the X1650 in the ubuntu repositories
2010-03-02T10:35:00.000Z	brjann	LaPrinj	okay, research
2010-03-02T10:35:00.000Z	brjann	LaPrinj	sorry, i mean i'm researching ;)
2010-03-02T10:36:00.000Z	brjann	LaPrinj	well it may have just broken down and decided to go with a failsafe which doesn't even bother to talk to the monitor
2010-03-02T10:37:00.000Z	brjann	LaPrinj	nono, merely that the system was confused and decided to go with a driver it knew would work but that offers no features.
2010-03-02T10:49:00.000Z	brjann	LaPrinj	heh, you too :)
2010-03-02T10:39:00.000Z	brjann	LaPrinj	the X1650 should work, it's got a driver and everything. :)
2010-03-02T10:40:00.000Z	brjann	LaPrinj	you can always try going through the xorg reconfiguration and trying to select the driver manually
2010-03-02T10:41:00.000Z	brjann	LaPrinj	are you logged on to that machine now?
2010-03-02T10:41:00.000Z	brjann	LaPrinj	as in, are you talking to us on that machine?
2010-03-02T10:42:00.000Z	brjann	LaPrinj	bummer, as this procedure involves killing xorg and dropping to a virtual terminal ;)
2010-03-02T10:44:00.000Z	brjann	LaPrinj	here's the procedure: http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/columns/how_to_fix_your_computers_graphics_with_dpkg-reconfigure
2010-03-02T10:45:00.000Z	brjann	LaPrinj	so if you're going to attempt that I'd either print it out or have it up on another computer
2010-03-02T10:47:00.000Z	brjann	LaPrinj	no problem, hope it helps. when you pick your driver, try either radeon or radeonhd, and make sure to leave the defaults alone when the guide says to :)
