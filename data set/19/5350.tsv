2008-09-20T09:51:00.000Z	vgambit		I just installed the latest version of ubuntu on a second partition on my laptop, so I can dual boot it with windows xp, but I get error 18 when I turn on the pc
2008-09-20T09:51:00.000Z	vgambit		I've been researching this problem and trying to fix it for about 2 hours and found that my bios doesn't support the hard drive (160 gb)
2008-09-20T09:51:00.000Z	vgambit		I just wanted to know if there was some way to get the mbr or whatever to work properly without having to destroy my windows partition
2008-09-20T09:52:00.000Z	FAJALOU1	vgambit	 there is a think called super grub disk
2008-09-20T09:54:00.000Z	vgambit	FAJALOU1	I'll try it but I'm not sure it will work
2008-09-20T10:01:00.000Z	vgambit	FAJALOU1	I tried to fix the boot of GNU/Linux and got SGD has not succeeded
2008-09-20T10:01:00.000Z	FAJALOU1	vgambit	 then you could try reinstalling GRUB; found on the last step of ubuntu setup under advanced.
2008-09-20T10:02:00.000Z	vgambit	FAJALOU1	I tried restoring for windows, but it could only find the linux installation
2008-09-20T10:03:00.000Z	FAJALOU1	vgambit	 go into your live cd, mount your linux installation and then type in 'sudo touch <pathtoHdd>/forcefsck
2008-09-20T10:06:00.000Z	vgambit	FAJALOU1	I'm starting up ubuntu live now, but I just tried booting into the installed linux using super grub disc and that didn't work
2008-09-20T10:06:00.000Z	FAJALOU1	vgambit	 sounds like your linux part is corrupted
2008-09-20T10:07:00.000Z	vgambit	FAJALOU1	hm. I dunno how that happened, considering all I did was install it
2008-09-20T10:08:00.000Z	FAJALOU1	vgambit	 i would try reinstalling it then; b/c it's a possibility that something just went a little wrong
2008-09-20T10:12:00.000Z	vgambit	FAJALOU1	I tried typing sudo touch <pathtoHdd>/forcefsck and that didn't seem to do anything
2008-09-20T10:12:00.000Z	FAJALOU1	vgambit	 try restarting now
2008-09-20T10:14:00.000Z	vgambit	FAJALOU1	I tried mounting the windows partition after typing the touch command, but it would not mount
2008-09-20T10:20:00.000Z	vgambit	FAJALOU1	I tried super grub disk again to see if I could boot into linux, and this time it gave a more verbose error 18: Selected cylinder exceeds maximum supported by BIOS
2008-09-20T10:47:00.000Z	FAJALOU1	vgambit	 use the gparted cd
2008-09-20T11:09:00.000Z	FAJALOU1	vgambit	 not gparted?
