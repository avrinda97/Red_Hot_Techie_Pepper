2011-04-07T15:09:00.000Z	edwinkcw		I have a laptop CQ42-170TX, I want to connect it with my external monitor BENQ 22". But in monitor resolution setting, the max res. is 1280x768 only, but my monitor can support 1920x1080
2011-04-07T15:09:00.000Z	edwinkcw		How can I fix it?
2011-04-07T15:10:00.000Z	ohsix	edwinkcw	you need to add the mode manually because the monitors edid information is incomplete/incorrect
2011-04-07T15:11:00.000Z	edwinkcw	ohsix	may I know how can I add it? I didn't have much knowledge about this.
2011-04-07T15:13:00.000Z	ohsix	edwinkcw	i can't walk you through it, but i can tell you you use "cvt" and xrandr --newmode and then --addmode with its output
2011-04-07T15:14:00.000Z	edwinkcw	ohsix	thanks, because in the old day, there is a x11.conf
2011-04-07T15:14:00.000Z	ohsix	edwinkcw	are you using nvidias binary driver?
2011-04-07T15:15:00.000Z	edwinkcw	ohsix	I am using Radeon propietary
2011-04-07T15:20:00.000Z	ohsix	edwinkcw	re: ati, i do not know if it does xrandr, if it doesn't you'll need to use xorg.conf or their control panel
2011-04-07T15:35:00.000Z	edwinkcw	ohsix	thanks and I fixed my problem
2011-04-07T15:35:00.000Z	ohsix	edwinkcw	good :]
2011-04-17T19:17:00.000Z	ohsix	edwinkcw	are you using the native player or the one with nspluginwrapper? i've had much better luck with nspluginwrapper NOT in the picture
2011-04-17T19:17:00.000Z	edwinkcw	ohsix	I use native player
2011-04-17T19:18:00.000Z	ohsix	edwinkcw	so you extracted and installed an .so yourself?
2011-04-17T19:20:00.000Z	edwinkcw	ohsix	I think I install it using apt-get
2011-04-17T19:20:00.000Z	ohsix	edwinkcw	ok then it is using nspluginwrapper, not native
2011-04-17T19:21:00.000Z	edwinkcw	ohsix	I am sorry, I don't know about it
2011-04-17T19:21:00.000Z	edwinkcw	ohsix	it says it is Adobe Flash player plugin installer
2011-04-17T19:22:00.000Z	ohsix	edwinkcw	basically, nspluginwrapper is a huge pile of mess and compromise, and the native 64bit plugin is much better
