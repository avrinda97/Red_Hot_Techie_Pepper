2005-07-12T06:03:00.000Z	nalioth		holy cow
2005-07-12T06:05:00.000Z	Wyzard	nalioth	thanks
2005-07-12T06:10:00.000Z	nalioth	Wyzard	if you are experienced, you know how to bring root back
2005-07-12T06:10:00.000Z	nalioth	Wyzard	sudo was set up for new users
2005-07-12T06:11:00.000Z	Wyzard	nalioth	Yes, I do, and I understand and agree with the default setting...  just trying to get a good sense of what's best for my own needs
2005-07-12T06:12:00.000Z	nalioth	Wyzard	only you can answer that. i've been using linux over 5 years and the sudo doesnt bother me (took a bit of gettin used to, tho)
2005-07-12T06:13:00.000Z	Wyzard	nalioth	The only thing about it that bothers me is that if someone figures out my login password, they effectively have my root password too
2005-07-12T06:14:00.000Z	nalioth	Wyzard	password security is a never ending journey
2005-07-12T06:14:00.000Z	Wyzard	nalioth	Indeed...  anyway, thanks for your help
2005-07-12T06:53:00.000Z	nalioth	Wyzard	they are very not necessarily compatible
2005-07-12T06:54:00.000Z	Wyzard	nalioth	Well, I don't want to unilaterally say "not compatible" because some probably are, but I don't want him to get the idea that he should go installing packages from Debian without knowing what he's doing  :-)
2005-07-12T06:55:00.000Z	nalioth	Wyzard	installing debian packages will quickly break us
2005-07-12T06:56:00.000Z	nalioth	Wyzard	i get packages 1 from apt, 2 source built from apt, 3d, hand-compiled (although i run PPC)
2005-07-12T07:05:00.000Z	Wyzard	nalioth	I read some of their developer docs today, about creating RPMs, and from what I can see of the metadata, I think the dpkg system is more robust...  but I still think I should learn RPM better
2005-07-12T07:05:00.000Z	nalioth	Wyzard	knowledge is power
2005-07-12T07:06:00.000Z	nalioth	Wyzard	yum hasnt brought much relief from 'dependency hell'
2005-07-12T07:07:00.000Z	Wyzard	nalioth	It seems OK to me...  downloads and installs deps as needed...  though I just installed the system yesterday so I don't have much experience with it yet
2005-07-12T07:09:00.000Z	nalioth	Wyzard	this is very very much better than rpms
