2005-03-31T09:36:00.000Z	GammaRay		mandrake supports kde and gnome about the same in my opinion
2005-03-31T09:36:00.000Z	GammaRay		mdk used to be "redhat w/ kde" but no longer
2005-03-31T09:38:00.000Z	GammaRay		huh? I never thought they were trying to make it look like kde.. and the unified theme they use looks like neigther
2005-03-31T09:40:00.000Z	GammaRay		eww
2005-03-31T09:41:00.000Z	GammaRay		I think we can all agree on that!
2005-03-31T09:42:00.000Z	GammaRay		I liek certain things about kde but I always am pissed when I run into a wall trying to make it work like xfce or gnome
2005-03-31T09:42:00.000Z	GammaRay		s/liek/like
2005-03-31T09:44:00.000Z	GammaRay		atleast that's my opinion
2005-03-31T09:45:00.000Z	GammaRay		dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xfree86 I think
2005-03-31T09:45:00.000Z	maxchee	GammaRay	KDE is supposed to be windows like and while I don't agree with its ways of making everything under the sun configuration, it actually works well (unlike gnome, which always leaves quite a bit to be desired)
2005-03-31T09:47:00.000Z	GammaRay	maxchee	I perfer smooth operation and configuration to "a mess" and I'm not that convinced that gnome really is that unconfigurable
2005-03-31T09:47:00.000Z	maxchee	GammaRay	they problem is not with configuration. Gnome doesn't even have proper menu editing and Dnd
2005-03-31T09:48:00.000Z	GammaRay	maxchee	that's certainly something to complain about
2005-03-31T09:49:00.000Z	GammaRay	maxchee	but I'm glad they atleast are taking their time and doing it right
2005-03-31T10:05:00.000Z	GammaRay	maxchee	buhahahaha!
2005-03-31T10:06:00.000Z	maxchee	GammaRay	Freaky...
2005-03-31T10:20:00.000Z	GammaRay	maxchee	well they are full of crap (-;
2005-03-31T10:23:00.000Z	maxchee	GammaRay	most people find that book to be very useful
2005-03-31T10:24:00.000Z	GammaRay	maxchee	well I'm sure they burn most of their brain cells just understanding OOP instead of learning how to program. two seperate things.
