2009-05-21T17:05:00.000Z	dooner	bullgard4	it means the chipset for the wireless card, not the actual model.
2009-05-21T17:06:00.000Z	bullgard4	dooner	How can I detrmine the chipset of the NETGEAR Wireless PC Card WG511?
2009-05-21T17:06:00.000Z	dooner	bullgard4	google seems to think the older wg511 are prism based,  where the newer ones are  atheros based
2009-05-21T17:07:00.000Z	bullgard4	dooner	I googled that result myself before. My question remains as I cannot see if my card is older or newer.
2009-05-21T17:08:00.000Z	dooner	bullgard4	you say the computer sees it?
2009-05-21T17:08:00.000Z	bullgard4	dooner	Yes.
2009-05-21T17:09:00.000Z	dooner	bullgard4	try dmesg  | grep -i wg511
2009-05-21T17:10:00.000Z	dooner	bullgard4	or lspci | grep -i Wireless
2009-05-21T17:11:00.000Z	dooner	bullgard4	or just lspci and read the output.
2009-05-21T17:30:00.000Z	bullgard4	dooner	'~$ dmesg  | grep -i wg511' produces no output. Nor '~$ lspci | grep -i Wireless'. '~$lspci' produces the line: "02:00:0 Network controller: Intersil Corporation ISL3890 [Prism GT/Prism Duettel/ISL3886 [Prism Javelin/Prism Xbow] (rev 01)." How can I use this information for the  man iwconfig statement: "Please refer to the man page of each device for details."?
2009-05-21T17:36:00.000Z	dooner	bullgard4	hmm.  so it is a prism xbox/javelin
2009-05-21T17:39:00.000Z	dooner	bullgard4	which release of ubuntu ?
2009-05-21T17:40:00.000Z	bullgard4	dooner	I cannot put to good use your answer. I'd like to know how I can use the above statement to make good use of the man iwconfig statement: ""Please refer to the man page of each device for details."?
2009-05-21T17:40:00.000Z	bullgard4	dooner	Ubuntu 9.04
2009-05-21T17:41:00.000Z	dooner	bullgard4	seems to be some issues with that card.  some suggestions saying use ndiswrappers (I don't know who to do that,sorry). this might help though...http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=701287
2009-05-21T17:41:00.000Z	bullgard4	dooner	I do not need ndiswrapper because the present driver works.
2009-05-21T17:42:00.000Z	dooner	bullgard4	 ok sorry, thought you where having issues getting it to work
2009-05-21T17:43:00.000Z	dooner	bullgard4	driver is prism54pci
2009-05-21T17:46:00.000Z	bullgard4	dooner	The driver is not prism54pci. The driver is prism54. --  I repeat my question: Where is the associated man page for it?
