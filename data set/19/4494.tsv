2009-01-04T11:47:00.000Z	tristanmike	LawnGnome1	problem is when we run alsamixer on 8.10, we get Pulse Audio, and for me, that's only one option, "Master". I need to get to the "old" alsamixer
2009-01-04T11:49:00.000Z	LawnGnome1	tristanmike	Uhm,,I have seen some of the Alsa bytes in the synaptic thing, let me look again...
2009-01-04T11:50:00.000Z	tristanmike	LawnGnome1	it's good
2009-01-04T11:50:00.000Z	tristanmike	LawnGnome1	I fiddled with some buttons and got it finally

2009-01-04T11:51:00.000Z	tristanmike	LawnGnome1	seems it's a couple of things
2009-01-04T11:52:00.000Z	tristanmike	LawnGnome1	it would seem that 1) I had to ensure that the switch "SB Live Analog/Digital Output Jack" needed to be Unchecked
2009-01-04T11:52:00.000Z	LawnGnome1	tristanmike	Usually is, that is what happens on overlays and stuff.
2009-01-04T11:53:00.000Z	tristanmike	LawnGnome1	2) I had to adjust some sliders
2009-01-04T11:54:00.000Z	tristanmike	LawnGnome1	sad that it doesn't detect it by default. Thanks for the kick in the pants in the right direction

2009-01-04T11:57:00.000Z	tristanmike	LawnGnome1	got it now... but it crackles very slightly
2009-01-04T11:58:00.000Z	LawnGnome1	tristanmike	Could be anything from a bad cord to a bad program,,I am going with cord or a mouse in the house. :o
2009-01-04T11:59:00.000Z	tristanmike	LawnGnome1	well, I'm gonna tackle that another day, again, thanks for the help. There's good karma for you ;)
