2005-07-26T09:05:00.000Z	desrt		rommer; there are a lot more advanced methods too that might work out better for you
2005-07-26T09:05:00.000Z	desrt		rommer; as long as you use a single database and the webservers themselves are stateless, you're fine
2005-07-26T09:06:00.000Z	desrt		rommer; things like phpbb, for example, are fine
2005-07-26T09:07:00.000Z	desrt		rommer; you can make multiple copies of static content and scripts
2005-07-26T09:07:00.000Z	desrt		rommer; but you need a single database
2005-07-26T09:07:00.000Z	desrt		rommer; or multiple database servers with replication
2005-07-26T09:08:00.000Z	desrt		dam_; did you chmod +x armyops230-linux.run ?
2005-07-26T09:09:00.000Z	desrt		dam_; on linux, you have to mark a program as 'executable' (+x) before you can run it....
2005-07-26T09:09:00.000Z	desrt		dam_; it's sort of like the equivilent of a file being .exe on windows
2005-07-26T09:10:00.000Z	desrt		pdg; what sort of card do you have?
2005-07-26T09:10:00.000Z	pdg	desrt	Radeon 9700
2005-07-26T09:12:00.000Z	pdg	desrt	it's already fglrx
2005-07-26T09:14:00.000Z	pdg	desrt	I was having some other kind of troubles with a NVidia, so I changed the video card, and now there's something else
2005-07-26T09:26:00.000Z	pdg	desrt	do you have any clue what that conflicting module could be?
2005-07-26T09:29:00.000Z	pdg	desrt	?
2005-07-26T09:30:00.000Z	pdg	desrt	(EE) fglrx(0): incompatible kernel module detected - HW accelerated OpenGL will not work
2005-07-26T09:32:00.000Z	pdg	desrt	yeah
2005-07-26T09:33:00.000Z	pdg	desrt	    Option "UseInternalAGPGART"         "no"
2005-07-26T09:36:00.000Z	pdg	desrt	intel_agp is in use, and agpgart is needed by it
