2005-03-16T13:25:00.000Z	FiNeX		i've found a problem in ubuntu... where can I report it?
2005-03-16T13:25:00.000Z	antrix	FiNeX	ubuntu has a bugzilla :-)
2005-03-16T13:25:00.000Z	FiNeX	antrix	wow... thx :-)
2005-03-16T13:31:00.000Z	antrix	FiNeX	Interesting.. I've never thought abt checking for speed that the media can support.
2005-03-16T13:31:00.000Z	FiNeX	antrix	yes
2005-03-16T13:31:00.000Z	FiNeX	antrix	k3b do that
2005-03-16T13:32:00.000Z	FiNeX	antrix	and it's based on the cdrtools package as gnomeburning frontend... I think
2005-03-16T13:33:00.000Z	antrix	FiNeX	sounds like a valid bugzilla report to me
2005-03-16T13:34:00.000Z	FiNeX	antrix	sorry... what do you mean (I don't know english very well -_- )
2005-03-16T13:35:00.000Z	antrix	FiNeX	I meant you should definitely file a report in bugzilla :-)
2005-03-16T13:36:00.000Z	FiNeX	antrix	... I want to try... maybe later I'll download it :)
2005-03-16T13:52:00.000Z	antrix	FiNeX	for hibernation, boot loader doesn't have to be modified. Just edit grub to get the resume=/dev/hdax part in
2005-03-16T13:52:00.000Z	FiNeX	antrix	thanks :)
2005-03-16T13:55:00.000Z	FiNeX	antrix	if the system wasn't hibernated, the "resume=/dev/hdaX" is ok?
2005-03-16T13:57:00.000Z	antrix	FiNeX	and u can leave that in ur kernel boot params in grub's config file. if system didn't hibernate - then it'll boot up normally, otherwise resume
2005-03-16T13:57:00.000Z	FiNeX	antrix	ok... thanks... :)
