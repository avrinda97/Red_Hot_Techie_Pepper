2010-07-10T19:09:00.000Z	cyberfux		hi all
2010-07-10T19:11:00.000Z	cyberfux		anyone with good knowledge of v4l there?
2010-07-10T19:12:00.000Z	hylian	cyberfux	you talking about video 4 linux and linuxTv?
2010-07-10T19:15:00.000Z	cyberfux	hylian	just video4linux, it's my effin webcam - totally laggy and timeshifted while taking a vid
2010-07-10T19:16:00.000Z	hylian	cyberfux	i can't say i am a expert. as a matter of fact i never used it. i actually looked ito it because i was gonna make a tivo out of a old intel box i have lying around. linuxtv was what i was referring to.
2010-07-10T19:19:00.000Z	hylian	cyberfux	so you are trying to find out why your webcam is acting up. im assuming your seeing this problem live and not via the internet, because net conditions can really mess things up
2010-07-10T19:21:00.000Z	cyberfux	hylian	yes it's live totally laggy w8 i upload a vid so u can c
2010-07-10T19:23:00.000Z	hylian	cyberfux	i dont need a video. ill take your word for it. hmm. assuming you have the latest drivers for your card (you said it was a bit old) is there a chance that another card is causing some problems? (like a buitl in sis or intel)
2010-07-10T19:25:00.000Z	cyberfux	hylian	well it's recognized otb and all i could see there is no newer driver, also the ASUS K50IJ was shipped with 10.04 and eery component is fully linux compatible. i THINK it's some weird settings prob, but video is not my world
2010-07-10T19:26:00.000Z	cyberfux	hylian	see http://n3rd.ws/1.ogv that says it better then words
2010-07-10T19:27:00.000Z	hylian	cyberfux	sadly it's not mine either. i would think if your card is 100% compatable it has to eb a software setting or ubuntu glitch. hmm. can you download the pclinuxos 2010 distro? im mwondering if you have the same glitch with that. pclinuxos has some drivers ubuntu hasnt. 2010 for newer cards, 2009 for older.
2010-07-10T19:28:00.000Z	cyberfux	hylian	i could try that but i'm really more a "ubuntu"-geek ;-) also the prob is in OpenSuSE, RedHat, Fedora etc. it LOOKS like settings
2010-07-10T19:28:00.000Z	hylian	cyberfux	if nothing else if you did or did not have a problem with that, it wouls atleast give you some diagnostic direction
2010-07-10T19:30:00.000Z	hylian	cyberfux	ubuntu, for it's few problems, is still way better than pclinuxos. i agree. it's just that 2009 uses older fglrx and nvidia drivers for older cards and 2010 has some specially built drivers as well. good for troubleshooting
2010-07-10T19:35:00.000Z	cyberfux	hylian	isn't that phrase correctly "In the immortal words of Khan Noonien Singh 'He tasks me....'"
2010-07-10T19:48:00.000Z	hylian	cyberfux	i must be a lucky son of a gun then because 10.04 runs on this machine like a dream. (ati drivers do suck on this though, just tossed my ati x1300 for that reason)
2010-07-10T19:49:00.000Z	cyberfux	hylian	must be ;-) i feel like getting worse since 8.04
2010-07-10T19:50:00.000Z	hylian	cyberfux	i actually agree with you on that, my ati x1300 worked great untill 8.10. then my driver was "no longer supported" i had to use pclinuxos for years
2010-07-10T19:52:00.000Z	cyberfux	hylian	effin crap shuttleworth is gettin it worse and worse only to "speed up the boot" and other $%&/()
