2010-11-19T05:01:00.000Z	Sonsee		Ok. Why does compiz --replace need sudo in Kubuntu anyway?
2010-11-19T05:02:00.000Z	neurochrome	Sonsee	that is weird...
2010-11-19T05:02:00.000Z	Sonsee	neurochrome	any suggestions?
2010-11-19T05:02:00.000Z	neurochrome	Sonsee	is this to get it to run on startup?
2010-11-19T05:03:00.000Z	neurochrome	Sonsee	have you tried "compiz --replace &"
2010-11-19T05:04:00.000Z	Sonsee	neurochrome	if I run it without sudo it crashes and asks to send a bug
2010-11-19T05:05:00.000Z	neurochrome	Sonsee	from the terminal?
2010-11-19T05:05:00.000Z	Sonsee	neurochrome	yes
2010-11-19T05:06:00.000Z	neurochrome	Sonsee	in a terminal you should run  "compiz --replace & exit"
2010-11-19T05:06:00.000Z	neurochrome	Sonsee	does it give any error, have you checked your logs?
2010-11-19T05:07:00.000Z	Sonsee	neurochrome	yes, it crashes. WIthout sudo. WITH sudo it works fine.
2010-11-19T05:07:00.000Z	neurochrome	Sonsee	check your logs for errors
2010-11-19T05:08:00.000Z	Sonsee	neurochrome	oh, come on !!! why does it work with & exit ?? )))))) lol I did it without & exit
2010-11-19T05:09:00.000Z	neurochrome	Sonsee	lol so it works with that command I said? ;0)
2010-11-19T05:10:00.000Z	neurochrome	Sonsee	if you add the command to Startup Applications it doesn't need the exit (because it is not run in a terminal then)
2010-11-19T05:10:00.000Z	neurochrome	Sonsee	the command to run in Startup Apps is "compiz --replace"
2010-11-19T05:11:00.000Z	Sonsee	neurochrome	but it needs an end (&) I guess ;) because without it doesn't work.
2010-11-19T05:12:00.000Z	neurochrome	Sonsee	mine hasn't got one and it works fine
2010-11-19T05:13:00.000Z	neurochrome	Sonsee	the & is only needed in the terminal, to continue the process, the reason you use exit is to close the terminal, without using exit you kill compiz when you want it to continue
