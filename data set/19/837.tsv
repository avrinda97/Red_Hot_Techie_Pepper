2011-10-18T14:16:00.000Z	txomon		hi, How can I upgrade to oneiric? I am using gnome-shell ppa and says I cant upgrade...
2011-10-18T14:16:00.000Z	arghx	txomon	what is the output of apt-get when you try to upgrade?
2011-10-18T14:16:00.000Z	txomon	arghx	nothing to be done
2011-10-18T14:17:00.000Z	arghx	txomon	are you actually trying to dist-upgrade?
2011-10-18T14:17:00.000Z	txomon	arghx	yes
2011-10-18T14:18:00.000Z	arghx	txomon	why wouldn't there be? e.g. uninstall the ppa packages at worst and then dist-upgrade
2011-10-18T14:18:00.000Z	arghx	txomon	not all X stuff
2011-10-18T14:19:00.000Z	txomon	arghx	http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/711823/
2011-10-18T14:19:00.000Z	txomon	arghx	its gnome-shell ppa
2011-10-18T14:19:00.000Z	arghx	txomon	you have no oneiric sources in your sources.list
2011-10-18T14:20:00.000Z	txomon	arghx	because I cant upgrade
2011-10-18T14:50:00.000Z	txomon	arghx	if I uninstall al X stuff, and remove gnome-shell ppa, will I be able to upgrade correctly, won't I?
2011-10-18T14:51:00.000Z	arghx	txomon	you do not want to uninstall "all X stuff"
2011-10-18T14:51:00.000Z	txomon	arghx	yes I want
2011-10-18T14:51:00.000Z	arghx	txomon	no you don't
2011-10-18T14:52:00.000Z	txomon	arghx	its gnome shell, so If I uninstall all gnome shell things, all will work, won't it?
2011-10-18T14:52:00.000Z	arghx	txomon	for such a special upgrade I strongly suggest to use apt-get instead of update center, but your choice
2011-10-18T15:05:00.000Z	txomon	arghx	how can I know which packages do depend on a ppa
2011-10-18T15:06:00.000Z	arghx	txomon	you can do it with aptitude but I dunno how anymore, I'd have to look
