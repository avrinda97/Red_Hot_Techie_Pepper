2010-11-01T18:16:00.000Z	abstrakt		is there a way to record and play back keyboard and mouse events?
2010-11-01T18:16:00.000Z	abstrakt		I want to make a screencast, but what I want to do is go through the motions/actions, take however long it takes me
2010-11-01T18:17:00.000Z	abstrakt		and then replay back those actions but all at a smooth consistent pace so people don't have to sit there and watch a motionless screen because I was thinking
2010-11-01T18:17:00.000Z	burhan	abstrakt	sounds like you need to plan your screencast before you start recording it :)
2010-11-01T18:18:00.000Z	abstrakt	burhan	no I have it planned out
2010-11-01T18:18:00.000Z	abstrakt	burhan	but for example, if I have code snippets, instead of typing them out myself, why not just echo snippet | myTypingProgram
2010-11-01T18:18:00.000Z	burhan	abstrakt	I might have a solution for the keyboard problem, but can't think of one for the mouse.
2010-11-01T18:18:00.000Z	abstrakt	burhan	so then people don't have to watch me backspace and correct typos for example
2010-11-01T18:19:00.000Z	abstrakt	burhan	ditto for mouse actions really
2010-11-01T18:19:00.000Z	burhan	abstrakt	hmm ... a history enabled clipboard might solve that part.
2010-11-01T18:19:00.000Z	abstrakt	burhan	ok, how do I get such a thing?
2010-11-01T18:19:00.000Z	burhan	abstrakt	you'd have to search for one and install it - or use an editor that can store snippets with keyboard hotkeys.
2010-11-01T18:20:00.000Z	abstrakt	burhan	it's not about storing the snippets, it's about having them appear as if they were typed out at a consistent e.g. 50wpm or so
2010-11-01T18:21:00.000Z	burhan	abstrakt	aaah okay, I understand your question now. You want the *appearance* of characters being typed even if you say - copy paste a snippet.
2010-11-01T18:21:00.000Z	abstrakt	burhan	yup
2010-11-01T18:22:00.000Z	abstrakt	burhan	and e.g. if I move my mouse from x,y to x+100,y+100 I would much rather have it just transition smoothely from point A to point B and ignore any of the jigger that my mousing hand might have introduced
2010-11-01T18:22:00.000Z	abstrakt	burhan	just want to make things as smooth and seamless as possible
2010-11-01T18:22:00.000Z	abstrakt	burhan	I supposed I just might have to write something like this myself
2010-11-01T18:23:00.000Z	burhan	abstrakt	I'm sorry I don't know of a way to do this, its a good idea though.
