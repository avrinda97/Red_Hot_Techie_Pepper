2010-12-28T05:30:00.000Z	oneliner		Hello there, just installed 10.10 and am beeing greeted by a blinking cursor and no boot, using live cd right now, any suggestions appreciated
2010-12-28T05:30:00.000Z	Jordan_U	oneliner	Do you have more than one hard drive?
2010-12-28T05:32:00.000Z	oneliner	Jordan_U	 yes Vincent1800  how would i check cd integrity, live versions is running ok, am using it
2010-12-28T05:32:00.000Z	oneliner	Jordan_U	 sata drive is my target drive for install, is set as primary boot after cd drive
2010-12-28T05:33:00.000Z	Jordan_U	oneliner	Grub was probably not installed to the drive you're booting from. Try changing the boot order (Ubuntu doesn't always install grub to the hard drive the rest of Ubuntu is installed to, which I don't particularly like).
2010-12-28T05:36:00.000Z	Jordan_U	oneliner	Once you're booted (or chrooted) into your Ubuntu system you can run "sudo dpkg-reconfigure grub-pc" to change what drive(s) Ubuntu installs grub to.
2010-12-28T05:39:00.000Z	oneliner	Jordan_U	 the installation completed sucesfuly, maybe i could check the grub folder config in the target drive_
2010-12-28T05:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U	oneliner	It's not an issue with the grub folder, it's an issue with what drive's mbr + embedded area grub was installed to.
2010-12-28T05:54:00.000Z	oneliner	Jordan_U	 could you give me that reconfigure command again_
2010-12-28T05:55:00.000Z	Jordan_U	oneliner	"sudo dpkg-recofnigure grub-pc" But that needs to be run from the installed system or from a chroot into the installed system.
2010-12-28T05:57:00.000Z	Jordan_U	oneliner	The error you're getting from grub suggests that your BIOS can only handle one of PATA or SATA at a given time, i.e. when you boot from the PATA drive the BIOS can't read from the SATA drive.
2010-12-28T05:59:00.000Z	Jordan_U	oneliner	Yes. To do so follow this guide: http://grub.enbug.org/Grub2LiveCdInstallGuide
2010-12-28T06:00:00.000Z	Jordan_U	oneliner	Once you're booted into Ubuntu you should still run "sudo dpkg-reconfigure grub-pc" to make sure that Ubuntu is configured to install grub to the SATA drive whenever there is an upgrade of the grub-pc package.
2010-12-28T06:00:00.000Z	oneliner	Jordan_U	 thank you, please stick while i try those two >)
2010-12-28T06:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	oneliner	You're welcome, I do need to leave in about 8 minutes though.
2010-12-28T06:11:00.000Z	oneliner	Jordan_U	 question i have chroot now, should i run your query or continue this guide from the link?
2010-12-28T06:12:00.000Z	Jordan_U	oneliner	Just run "dpkg-reconfigure grub-pc" within the chroot. dpkg-reconfigure grub-pc itself runs grub-install and grub-mkconfig.
2010-12-28T06:13:00.000Z	Jordan_U	oneliner	Make sure you select only the drive, like /dev/sdb, and *not* any partition like /dev/sdb1.
2010-12-29T06:46:00.000Z	oneliner	Jordan_U	around?
