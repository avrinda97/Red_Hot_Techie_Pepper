2005-03-13T13:20:00.000Z	Noob1		hey guys
2005-03-13T13:20:00.000Z	Noob1		anyone out there tonight
2005-03-13T13:22:00.000Z	Noob1		how do u switch to kde session on ubuntu?
2005-03-13T13:22:00.000Z	apokryphos	Noob1	you log out, select "Session > KDE" then login
2005-03-13T13:23:00.000Z	apokryphos	Noob1	if it's now there? Have you installed kde, first? It [Ubuntu]  doesn't automatically come with kde
2005-03-13T13:24:00.000Z	Noob1	apokryphos	oh ok thanks , on more question ... where do i install new apps on ubuntu that are on the cd
2005-03-13T13:24:00.000Z	apokryphos	Noob1	Not sure if there's an add/remove package manager in Gnome... there might be. You can always just put in the cd and drag the debs out, but you'll probably have quite a few dependency issues
2005-03-13T13:25:00.000Z	apokryphos	Noob1	if you've got a decent connection, the easiest way is to just get them from the repositories
2005-03-13T13:26:00.000Z	Noob1	apokryphos	lol i have ubuntu on laptop and cant get wireless to work , the program jamms the whole time
2005-03-13T13:26:00.000Z	apokryphos	Noob1	I know Warty has quite a few laptop issues, a lot of which -- I hear -- are sorted in hoary. Which one are you using?
2005-03-13T13:26:00.000Z	Noob1	apokryphos	warty i think ,
2005-03-13T13:27:00.000Z	apokryphos	Noob1	what's your Internet connection like?
2005-03-13T13:27:00.000Z	Noob1	apokryphos	pretty good
2005-03-13T13:27:00.000Z	apokryphos	Noob1	it's probably worth upgrading to hoary, then.
2005-03-13T13:28:00.000Z	Noob1	apokryphos	is there uprage files ? or do i have to get the whole iso?
2005-03-13T13:28:00.000Z	apokryphos	Noob1	it's very, very easy to do.
2005-03-13T13:33:00.000Z	apokryphos	Noob1	you can do either. Updating from ubuntu is far easier
2005-03-13T13:34:00.000Z	apokryphos	Noob1	Ok. No worries; you can still update from the iso.
2005-03-13T13:35:00.000Z	apokryphos	Noob1	see the topic for the latest array
