2010-03-21T04:12:00.000Z	Resistol		Anyone in here have Ubuntu running on a toshiba a135?
2010-03-21T04:14:00.000Z	Trek	Resistol	what exactly is your issue with it?
2010-03-21T04:15:00.000Z	Resistol	Trek	right now I've got a really messed up Vista installed on the a135, and I'm trying to put Ubuntu on instead - but I couldn't get the livecd to boot - when I select "try without making changes' i just get a black screen with a blinking cursor
2010-03-21T04:16:00.000Z	Trek	Resistol	you have to give the darn thing some time to load, the blinky cursor screen is normal for a little while.  ANd also, in Vista, you cant shrink the active partition :P
2010-03-21T04:16:00.000Z	Trek	Resistol	the CD will let you mess with the partitions as you install it, so just give it time to load up the livecd
2010-03-21T04:17:00.000Z	Trek	Resistol	perhaps you have a bad/incomplete CD?
2010-03-21T04:17:00.000Z	Trek	Resistol	use a different image file (redownload)
2010-03-22T03:17:00.000Z	Trek	Resistol	hardware failure?
2010-03-22T03:18:00.000Z	Resistol	Trek	no the hard drive is fine.  the boot manager is just confused apparently - after changing from sda2 to sda1, it's freaking out
2010-03-22T03:18:00.000Z	Trek	Resistol	reinstall the bootloader, get SuperGrubDisk or whatever its called
2010-03-22T03:19:00.000Z	Resistol	Trek	could i use grub to load windows instead of windows boot loader?
2010-03-22T03:19:00.000Z	Trek	Resistol	I use GRUB just to switch from XP and 7 :P  but you might consider waiting for histo to find you instructions for reloading the windows boot loader
2010-03-22T03:19:00.000Z	Trek	Resistol	or let me see what my technicians repair CD has for repairing the MBR
2010-03-22T03:20:00.000Z	Trek	Resistol	if it has a repair tool for MBR, then I'll refer you to a downloader for the ISO ;P
2010-03-23T00:31:00.000Z	Trek	Resistol	System > Adminstration > Hardware Drivers for starters, it lists the updated drivers for proprietary cards (ATI, NVIDIA)
2010-03-23T00:31:00.000Z	Trek	Resistol	/ theadmin: i guess you'll have to search the interwebz then
2010-03-23T00:32:00.000Z	Trek	Resistol	sounds a bit older, whats the specs on your system in terms of age
2010-03-23T00:33:00.000Z	Resistol	Trek	it's probably 4-5 years old, intel celeron m, 512mb ram
2010-03-23T01:02:00.000Z	Trek	Resistol	run the make command in the terminal (which I assume you did), then select all the output, go to the edit menu, select copy, and paste it to pastebin.com.  and give me the link it sends you to after it pastes it
