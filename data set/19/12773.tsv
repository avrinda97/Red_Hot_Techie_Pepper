2005-07-08T08:29:00.000Z	whitti		sure
2005-07-08T08:29:00.000Z	sfvt	whitti	is it a USB wireless? I just build the driver for a Linksys WUSB11
2005-07-08T08:29:00.000Z	whitti	sfvt	that's it
2005-07-08T08:30:00.000Z	sfvt	whitti	it's easy to build... hold on I'll give the URL for the instructions
2005-07-08T08:30:00.000Z	whitti	sfvt	I have the Belkin with the atmel chip
2005-07-08T08:31:00.000Z	sfvt	whitti	here are the steps I took: http://sbb.uvm.edu/~sfeehan/dads-computer/Atmel/INSTRUCTIONS
2005-07-08T08:31:00.000Z	whitti	sfvt	I'll take a look
2005-07-08T08:32:00.000Z	sfvt	whitti	note that this doesn't use the ubuntu package for the driver... it's in the universe repo adn I plan to take a look at some point. it should work with module-assistant and therefore be a better solution than compiing from CVS
2005-07-08T08:32:00.000Z	whitti	sfvt	great
2005-07-08T08:33:00.000Z	whitti	sfvt	I could perform most of these steps from a different PC and copy them across via CD?
2005-07-08T08:33:00.000Z	sfvt	whitti	yes, as long as the kernel headers you compile against match the kernel you will run with
2005-07-08T08:35:00.000Z	sfvt	whitti	if you look in the directory on my site there is a tar.gz of the modules compiled for the current 386 kernel for hoary... feel free to use them, though I make no guarentee ;)
2005-07-08T08:36:00.000Z	whitti	sfvt	The easy option: I'm running the 686 kernel on this, so that would be easier :)
2005-07-08T08:37:00.000Z	sfvt	whitti	not being a kernel guru, I'm not sure if my modules will work on a 686 kernel... probably better to just follow the directions. It should only take a few minuets.
2005-07-08T08:39:00.000Z	whitti	sfvt	The one I'm transferring to is 386. The one I would compile on is 686
2005-07-08T08:40:00.000Z	whitti	sfvt	Therefore, thanks for the modules :)
2005-07-08T08:40:00.000Z	sfvt	whitti	yeah, should be ok. no problem... hope they work.
2005-07-08T08:48:00.000Z	whitti	sfvt	If it fails, I'll come back and tell you. Thanks for the help
2005-07-08T08:48:00.000Z	sfvt	whitti	cool. good luck.
