2009-11-10T23:10:00.000Z	vMCubun		im a total noob, i need a GUI'd firewall that can be setup as i use the internet, so it learns from allow/blocks that i do ..any sugggetions?
2009-11-10T23:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	vMCubun	 why do you think you need a firewall?
2009-11-10T23:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	vMCubun	 You might want to learn some more linux basics befor messing with selinux
2009-11-10T23:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	vMCubun	 learn how linux works.. and realize it proberly allready is.
2009-11-10T23:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	vMCubun	 they are all front ends to the iptables commands
2009-11-10T23:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	vMCubun	 because4 theres no default rules...
2009-11-10T23:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	vMCubun	 theres no need.. this is not windows
2009-11-10T23:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	vMCubun	 dont install any services you dont need... done...
2009-11-10T23:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	vMCubun	 no rules = its not really enabled.. its just showing a gui
2009-11-10T23:24:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	vMCubun	 you are being paranoid.. in theory if you did things that way - you wouldent be able to do much. Linux wull not pop up a dialalog saying 'allow this app to access the internet' like windows does.. the program if blocked just wont work right.
2009-11-10T23:25:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	vMCubun	 read up on firewalling/iptables and learn what it can do and how to lck things  down
2009-11-10T23:25:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	vMCubun	 do 'sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade' is one way
2009-11-10T23:27:00.000Z	vMCubun	Dr_Willis	that seems to be doing a whole bunch of stuff ...why didn't it do it automatically?
2009-11-10T23:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	vMCubun	 it checks once a day.  and nags you
2009-11-10T23:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	vMCubun	 when it says  theres updates.. then update..
2009-11-10T23:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	vMCubun	 it checks once  a day normally, and I have seen it nag me on a new install. its just a matter of the time of day
2009-11-10T23:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	vMCubun	 yes
2009-11-10T23:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	vMCubun	 all the apt programs get the same packages
2009-11-10T23:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	vMCubun	 yes.,
