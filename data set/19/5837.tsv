2008-05-20T23:52:00.000Z	m1dn1ght	rangnamei_absolu	have you installed the non-free flash package?
2008-05-20T23:53:00.000Z	m1dn1ght	rangnamei_absolu	like erUSUL said - flash is one of the few areas where windows still has advantage it seems.  Even now firefox still crashes for me sometimes opening flash vids.
2008-05-20T23:53:00.000Z	m1dn1ght	rangnamei_absolu	is it crashing your whole system, or just firefox?
2008-05-20T23:54:00.000Z	m1dn1ght	rangnamei_absolu	 is the non-free flash package the only one you have installed?
2008-05-20T23:56:00.000Z	m1dn1ght	rangnamei_absolu	do you know how to use synaptic?
2008-05-21T00:02:00.000Z	m1dn1ght	rangnamei_absolu	www.pastebin.com - then post the URL here for things like that
2008-05-21T00:04:00.000Z	m1dn1ght	rangnamei_absolu	do you know how to use synaptic?  try uninstalling what flash you have then install all of the libflash packages in Synaptic package manager maybe.  That's the method I used, but even now it still crashes firefox sometimes
2008-05-21T00:06:00.000Z	m1dn1ght	rangnamei_absolu	like people have said - flash is temperemental as hell in linux for some reason.  Adobe doesn't seem to be overly interested in devoted resources to fixing it
2008-05-21T00:07:00.000Z	m1dn1ght	rangnamei_absolu	don't know if it's possible to install the windows version of firefox under wine with the windows flash plugins?  I'm just thinking out loud, but maybe that could work?
2008-05-21T00:09:00.000Z	m1dn1ght	rangnamei_absolu	go to System -> Admin -> Synaptic Package Manager.  Hit search and type flash.  Scroll down and see if flashplugin-nonfree is shaded in
2008-05-21T00:12:00.000Z	m1dn1ght	rangnamei_absolu	go to System -> Admin -> Synaptic Package Manager.  Hit search and type flash.  Scroll down and see if flashplugin-nonfree is shaded in.  That is the Adobe plugin.
