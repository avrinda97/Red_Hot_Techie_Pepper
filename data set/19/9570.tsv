2006-10-21T08:50:00.000Z	Lubix		hey i got a like total sacrilige question....i downloaded a copy of xp that was from my gf's laptop, i have a licensed copy but its at home, the install totally sucks it cant connect to the net or nothing is it b/c it was designed for her hardware?
2006-10-21T08:51:00.000Z	Lubix		i only need it cuz i do vs2003 for a class
2006-10-21T08:52:00.000Z	agent	Lubix	probably.... just install ubuntu... no need to taint your computer with that x...p... creature :P
2006-10-21T08:52:00.000Z	Lubix	agent	i need visual studio 03 for school
2006-10-21T08:53:00.000Z	agent	Lubix	but seriously... thats probably your problem... windows usually is computer specific
2006-10-21T08:54:00.000Z	agent	Lubix	another idea: run a windows emulator on ubuntu
2006-10-21T08:55:00.000Z	Lubix	agent	where might i get one?
2006-10-21T08:56:00.000Z	agent	Lubix	there is qemu (open source) and vmware (not open source) that i know of... i have used both before with success
2006-10-21T08:57:00.000Z	Lubix	agent	im downloading qemu now
2006-10-21T08:58:00.000Z	agent	Lubix	from what i remember, 98 works  best on qemu
2006-10-21T09:00:00.000Z	Lubix	agent	how does qemu work
2006-10-21T09:01:00.000Z	agent	Lubix	http://fabrice.bellard.free.fr/qemu/
2006-10-21T09:02:00.000Z	Lubix	agent	i know ima probably sound stupid here but do i have to install xp or what goes on here?
2006-10-21T09:03:00.000Z	agent	Lubix	you can install almost any x32 os... any linux and windows from 95 until xp... but i recommend 98 as its the fastest and its compatible with your program
2006-10-21T09:04:00.000Z	agent	Lubix	think of is as a "computer inside your computer" :)
2006-10-21T09:04:00.000Z	Lubix	agent	im working on it ill let u know if get it up
2006-10-21T09:05:00.000Z	agent	Lubix	i have to get going.... refer to that howto and qemu website (website has good documentation)... it works because i used it as far back as 2 years ago :)
2006-10-21T09:07:00.000Z	Lubix	agent	alirght thanks for the heads up on that app tho
2006-10-21T09:07:00.000Z	agent	Lubix	your welcome
