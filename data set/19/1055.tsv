2011-07-23T17:28:00.000Z	CaptainQuirk		Hi
2011-07-23T17:28:00.000Z	CaptainQuirk		My PC under ubuntu froze twice in a row in the last 30 minutes
2011-07-23T17:28:00.000Z	CaptainQuirk		I had to reboot
2011-07-23T17:29:00.000Z	CaptainQuirk		the first time, I got a set of nasty error message when booting
2011-07-23T17:29:00.000Z	CaptainQuirk		the second time, It did'nt reboot
2011-07-23T17:29:00.000Z	CaptainQuirk		the third time, I could select the OS in grub but it kept on rebooting each time
2011-07-23T17:30:00.000Z	CaptainQuirk		I try to fix the MBR with supergrub disk
2011-07-23T17:30:00.000Z	CaptainQuirk		it seemed that the program hanged on the reading of the grub files
2011-07-23T17:30:00.000Z	CaptainQuirk		I tried to launch a live session with a cd but it wouldn't start correctly
2011-07-23T17:31:00.000Z	CaptainQuirk		I get crc error : system halted
2011-07-23T17:31:00.000Z	dr_willis	CaptainQuirk	 crc error = bad cd/optcal disk/media. or could be a ram issue
2011-07-23T17:32:00.000Z	dr_willis	CaptainQuirk	 a normal ubuntu live should do the job of reinstalling grub also. if you use the right commandline commands.
2011-07-23T17:33:00.000Z	CaptainQuirk	dr_willis	yeah ok, but how can I access the command line from the live CD
2012-03-19T16:13:00.000Z	dr_willis	CaptainQuirk	 if you  use 'echo yourfancycommandline' it will print out how bash would see it after everything is parsed and replaced.
2012-03-19T16:15:00.000Z	CaptainQuirk	dr_willis	ehh, I don't get you
2012-03-19T16:21:00.000Z	dr_willis	CaptainQuirk	 then your $COOKIE is not currently.. You canuse echo as a 'test' to see what its going to do exactly.
2012-03-19T16:21:00.000Z	CaptainQuirk	dr_willis	I do and there's something inside it
2012-03-19T16:21:00.000Z	dr_willis	CaptainQuirk	 depending on how you are doing the command, and whats running it. will dictate how you need to quote the arguments
2012-03-19T16:22:00.000Z	dr_willis	CaptainQuirk	 so i think the channel needs some more details. I dont think you are using 'http get....' from a bash shell are you?
