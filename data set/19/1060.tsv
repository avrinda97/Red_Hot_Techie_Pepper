2011-05-25T14:43:00.000Z	jsuhde		I installed 11.04 64bit, wireless works fine. Couldn't get some packages to work so I bit the bullet and went 32bit route. During install I was able to use wireless no problem, however after 32bit install wireless is dead, I tryed installing again, wireless is still dead except this time I couldn't access it during install. Suggestions?
2011-05-25T14:44:00.000Z	dcg	jsuhde	is this a laptop?
2011-05-25T14:44:00.000Z	jsuhde	dcg	yes
2011-05-25T14:46:00.000Z	jsuhde	dcg	It has a dedicated wifi button, still don't understand why it worked no problem in 64 bit, so you sugest I try a fn-f2?
2011-05-25T14:46:00.000Z	dcg	jsuhde	just try the wifi button, see if it helps
2011-05-25T14:47:00.000Z	jsuhde	dcg	been there done that £åügHîñg Øüt £öüÐ
2011-05-25T14:49:00.000Z	dcg	jsuhde	do you have any working internet connection on the linux machine (wired maybe)?
2011-05-25T14:50:00.000Z	jsuhde	dcg	kinda, but not easily accessable. Any reason why 64bit install would work and 32 wouldn't?
2011-05-25T14:52:00.000Z	dcg	jsuhde	likely driver issues. but if wifi got disabled for some reason you may need to re-enable it using wifi button, or bios
2011-05-25T14:53:00.000Z	jsuhde	dcg	tried that, bios doesnt have that option. Seems strange that it was working during install of 32bit, would the LiveCD use a driver from the 64bit install for some reason?
2011-05-25T14:55:00.000Z	dcg	jsuhde	no more likely the 32 bit install uses an older version of the driver. it is also possible that the 64bit driver has put the card into 64 bit mode, and for some reason the 32bit driver has not reversed that.
2011-05-25T14:56:00.000Z	jsuhde	dcg	but it *was* working during my first install of 32.... after reboot, dead.
2011-05-25T14:56:00.000Z	jsuhde	dcg	I'm at a complete loss
2011-05-25T14:57:00.000Z	dcg	jsuhde	yes, on first install of 32bit it may work, then once you have used 64bit it may be forced into a different mode that will not work in 32bit
2011-05-25T14:59:00.000Z	jsuhde	dcg	the thing is I installed 64 first, then loaded a LiveCD of 32. On the install of 64 after reboot, it worked, during the install of 32 it worked, after reboot nada. I tried reinstalling 32, during install its broken, after reboot it's broken. It just doesn't make sense ¶:(
2011-05-25T15:00:00.000Z	dcg	jsuhde	hmmm, unless one of the drivers has done something strange I don't knwo
2011-05-25T15:01:00.000Z	jsuhde	dcg	I guess I'll just try again
2011-05-25T15:01:00.000Z	jsuhde	dcg	thanks for your time
