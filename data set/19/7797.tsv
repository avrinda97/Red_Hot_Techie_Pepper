2007-10-12T08:16:00.000Z	WaltzingAlong	seb__	which system are you using? feisty? you can install vmware server through the canonical repository
2007-10-12T08:18:00.000Z	seb__	WaltzingAlong	im on 7.04 and i cant find it in the package manager
2007-10-12T08:19:00.000Z	WaltzingAlong	seb__	have you enabled the canonical repository?       deb http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu feisty-commercial main
2007-10-12T08:20:00.000Z	seb__	WaltzingAlong	nope how do i enable it
2007-10-12T08:21:00.000Z	WaltzingAlong	seb__	through synaptic i guess, manager repositories
2007-10-12T08:23:00.000Z	seb__	WaltzingAlong	i must sound like a total noob but i cant find any option is synaptic to add repositories
2007-10-12T08:24:00.000Z	WaltzingAlong	seb__	scroll up?
2007-10-12T08:27:00.000Z	seb__	WaltzingAlong	I added the repository and its still not coming up in search
2007-10-12T08:27:00.000Z	WaltzingAlong	seb__	after you add the repository and enable it, you need to update your sources
