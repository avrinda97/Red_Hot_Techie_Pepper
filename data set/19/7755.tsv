2007-06-29T07:19:00.000Z	Stormx2	UbuntuNewbies	What does it get stuck on? have you tried recovery mode?
2007-06-29T07:19:00.000Z	Stormx2	UbuntuNewbies	I assume you're talking about boot-up, yeah?
2007-06-29T07:20:00.000Z	UbuntuNewbies	Stormx2	yeah, it's getting stuck right before it's about to load the login window. However, the cursor is blinking and everything seems ok, but it never loads next window
2007-06-29T07:20:00.000Z	Stormx2	UbuntuNewbies	Okay.
2007-06-29T07:21:00.000Z	Stormx2	UbuntuNewbies	Load up recovery mode (from the GRUB menu) and look into the X log.
2007-06-29T07:21:00.000Z	Stormx2	UbuntuNewbies	It will be in /var/log. How much experience with linux have you had?
2007-06-29T07:21:00.000Z	UbuntuNewbies	Stormx2	when trying to load up in safe mode, the problem is still there..
2007-06-29T07:22:00.000Z	Stormx2	UbuntuNewbies	Can you hit Ctrl + Alt + F1?
2007-06-29T07:22:00.000Z	Stormx2	UbuntuNewbies	Does that do anything?
2007-06-29T07:22:00.000Z	UbuntuNewbies	Stormx2	I'm not a pro, but I know howto edit the config files, if you route me through it roughly :-)
2007-06-29T07:22:00.000Z	UbuntuNewbies	Stormx2	yeah, the last message on the screen is Loading boot script [OK]  or something..
2007-06-29T07:23:00.000Z	Stormx2	UbuntuNewbies	Okay. Ctrl + Alt + F2, does that give you the option to log in?
2007-06-29T07:24:00.000Z	UbuntuNewbies	Stormx2	already logged in as root and I'm in /var/log
2007-06-29T07:24:00.000Z	Stormx2	UbuntuNewbies	Ah! haha. Okay. ls -l, find the Xorg log. nano it, find any lines beginning with (EE)
2007-06-29T07:25:00.000Z	UbuntuNewbies	Stormx2	any way to make that ls -l list come in steps? Cause it's too big, so I'm loosing the beginning.
2007-06-29T07:25:00.000Z	Stormx2	UbuntuNewbies	in /var/log? Shouldn't be long. Pipe it through more: ls -l | more
2007-06-29T07:26:00.000Z	Stormx2	UbuntuNewbies	You can hit enter to move down, and q to quit.
2007-06-29T07:28:00.000Z	Stormx2	UbuntuNewbies	You deleted your xorg.conf? o.O
2007-06-29T07:31:00.000Z	UbuntuNewbies	Stormx2	I installed it yesterday.. I'll just reinstall it =)
