2006-01-28T14:23:00.000Z	keherman	ashyg	does this computer have a recovery software on the hard drive?
2006-01-28T14:23:00.000Z	keherman	ashyg	what PC is it?
2006-01-28T14:23:00.000Z	keherman	ashyg	is it from a manufacturer?
2006-01-28T14:24:00.000Z	keherman	ashyg	ok so there is no recovery partition good
2006-01-28T14:24:00.000Z	keherman	ashyg	last time it worked was when?
2006-01-28T14:24:00.000Z	ashyg	keherman	never
2006-01-28T14:24:00.000Z	keherman	ashyg	this is a first time install?
2006-01-28T14:24:00.000Z	ashyg	keherman	the first time ubuntu was installed on this system, it occured on the third boot
2006-01-28T14:25:00.000Z	keherman	ashyg	did you format the ENTIRE DISK?
2006-01-28T14:25:00.000Z	keherman	ashyg	sounds like your boot loader is choosing the wrong one then -- is it SERIAL ATA?
2006-01-28T14:29:00.000Z	keherman	ashyg	what FS did you install?
2006-01-28T14:29:00.000Z	ashyg	keherman	ext3
