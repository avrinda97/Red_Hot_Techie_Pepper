2012-11-02T07:17:00.000Z	philllllijw		I'm installing ubuntu and I would like to know more about LVM. Essentailly what I want to do is have my /home as a separate partition. Is there an option for that?
2012-11-02T07:18:00.000Z	psusi	philllllijw	you might want to read http://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lvm
2012-11-02T07:19:00.000Z	psusi	philllllijw	you can have a /home partition without LVM, but LVM has other advantages, also has disadvantages though
2012-11-02T07:19:00.000Z	philllllijw	psusi	what are the disadvantages
2012-11-02T07:19:00.000Z	psusi	philllllijw	Windows doesn't recognize lvm volumes... it's a bit more difficult to setup
2012-11-02T07:20:00.000Z	philllllijw	psusi	I probably don't need all the fanciness LVM provides
2012-11-02T07:20:00.000Z	psusi	philllllijw	the normal gui Ubuntu installer doesn't support it so you have to do some command line management basically
2012-11-02T07:21:00.000Z	psusi	philllllijw	but if you're comfortable on the command line, it has some significant advantages, especially if you tend to use multiple disks and multiple Linux installs
2012-11-02T07:22:00.000Z	philllllijw	psusi	i'm doing a netinstall and i'm fairly comfy with cmdline.
2012-11-02T07:22:00.000Z	psusi	philllllijw	then you might like the features LVM provides... see the wiki entry I wrote for more info... but if you just want a separate /home partition, you can get by without it
2012-11-02T07:23:00.000Z	philllllijw	psusi	I'll just separate /home for now. Any idea if I can do that easily through the curses interface?
2012-11-02T07:23:00.000Z	psusi		if you find yourself occationally setting up partitions to install Linux distros to for testing, resize partitions or move them between disks, then lvm may be for you... otherwise, might not be worth the bother
2012-11-02T07:24:00.000Z	psusi	philllllijw	you can do that easily with the regular GUI Ubuntu installer
2012-11-02T07:24:00.000Z	philllllijw	psusi	I dont have any intentions of installing various versions of linux. I do watn teh option to overwrite my installation without losing my /home directory though
2012-11-02T07:25:00.000Z	psusi	philllllijw	you can do that just fine without LVM
2012-11-02T07:25:00.000Z	psusi	philllllijw	just create a /home partition with the regular gui installer and set it to be mounted at /home
2012-11-02T07:25:00.000Z	philllllijw	psusi	ok, I can't seem to figure it out using the installer
2012-11-02T07:26:00.000Z	psusi	philllllijw	you also don't need a separate /home partition to keep your home directory if you reinstall Ubuntu... just choose manual partitioning, configure the /home partition mount point, and DON'T check the format box
2012-11-02T07:27:00.000Z	psusi	philllllijw	you can even reinstall and preserve your home directory without having a separate partition if you want these days
