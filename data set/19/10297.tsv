2006-06-29T13:33:00.000Z	lampshade	kurzer	you have to install unrar-free or unrar.  Doesn't come by default
2006-06-29T13:33:00.000Z	kurzer	lampshade	 yeah thats what i wanna know ...
2006-06-29T13:33:00.000Z	kurzer	lampshade	 where do i get it ?
2006-06-29T13:36:00.000Z	lampshade	kurzer	 make sure the universe repositories are enabled and then sudo apt-get install unrar-free or use the graphical installer Synaptic or Add Remove
2006-06-29T13:38:00.000Z	kurzer	lampshade	 ok what is the universe repository ???? im absolutely noob
2006-06-29T13:41:00.000Z	lampshade	kurzer	Ok, basically the easiest way to get programs is to use what is known as the repositories, or repos.  In the repos are collections of programs.  There are different repos you can add or remove  such as universe, multiverse, etc.  Anyway, for the most part, you can follow the guides here http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Dapper  or the official wiki at wiki.ubuntu.com  Ubuntuguide is a little more noob friendly in my opinion
2006-06-29T13:44:00.000Z	kurzer	lampshade	 ok i will look there .... just one more question is there a difference between ubuntu and dapper ?????
2006-06-29T13:44:00.000Z	lampshade	kurzer	dapper is a version of Ubuntu
2006-06-29T13:44:00.000Z	lampshade	kurzer	like XP is a version of windows
2006-06-29T13:45:00.000Z	kurzer	lampshade	ok where can i see which version i use ?
2006-06-29T13:45:00.000Z	lampshade	kurzer	system >> About Ubuntu  and it should tell you in that first paragraph that comes up
2006-06-29T13:47:00.000Z	kurzer	lampshade	 ok its dapper
