2012-06-04T03:46:00.000Z	Ceres		Hi. I'm looking for a little help with the terminal.
2012-06-04T03:46:00.000Z	Ceres		I'm new to Linux.
2012-06-04T03:46:00.000Z	Ceres		Okay, so I'm starting a 'process' like this: node filename.js
2012-06-04T03:47:00.000Z	Ceres		And then, when I want it to stop, I do Ctrl+Z
2012-06-04T03:47:00.000Z	Ceres		And then I have to do "ps" to find it's PID, and then I do: kill -9 PID to stop it.
2012-06-04T03:47:00.000Z	Ceres		There must be a better way :/
2012-06-04T03:47:00.000Z	Ceres		Okay, so Ctrl-C.
2012-06-04T03:47:00.000Z	Ceres		Thanks.
2012-06-04T03:48:00.000Z	Ceres		If I ctrl+Z to suspend a process, how do I un-suspend it?
2012-06-04T03:48:00.000Z	reisio	Ceres	fg
2012-06-04T03:48:00.000Z	reisio	Ceres	or look into 'jobs'
2012-06-04T03:49:00.000Z	reisio	Ceres	they're usually shell built-ins, so you can run 'help jobs' or 'help fg'
2012-06-04T03:49:00.000Z	reisio	Ceres	as well as being provided by coreutils if you want to use those for some reason (not likely)
2012-06-04T03:52:00.000Z	reisio	Ceres	I'd probably just open another terminal tab, yeah
2012-06-04T03:54:00.000Z	reisio	Ceres	the meat of it is 'screen' to start, CTRL+a, then c to -create- new "screens", CTRL+a, then K (that's SHIFT+k) to kill the current one, CTRL+a, then # to jump around them (or CTRL+a, then " [SHIFT+']), CTRL+a, then ESC to enter selection mode, SPACE to toggle selection on/off, and CTRL+a, ] to paste
2012-06-04T03:55:00.000Z	reisio	Ceres	try it out after you get screen
2012-06-04T03:57:00.000Z	reisio	Ceres	some Ubuntu people also like byobu http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byobu_%28software%29
2012-06-04T03:58:00.000Z	reisio	Ceres	you can also accidentally (or not) close a terminal with screen running in it, and re-attach to it later, everything will still be running
2012-06-04T03:59:00.000Z	reisio	Ceres	what sort of commands
