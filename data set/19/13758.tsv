2005-02-26T17:47:00.000Z	marcin_ant		just a second - I need to verify
2005-02-26T07:20:00.000Z	marcin_ant		well guys you know what is the most frustrating thing about ubuntu as rootless distro?
2005-02-26T07:20:00.000Z	marcin_ant		that there is no completion when you type command after sudo
2005-02-26T07:20:00.000Z	LinuxJones	marcin_ant	sudo -s get's you a root terminal
2005-02-27T07:49:00.000Z	LinuxJones	marcin_ant	swap is not a bad thing
2005-02-27T07:50:00.000Z	marcin_ant	LinuxJones	I just don't want to listen to my hdd
2005-02-27T07:51:00.000Z	LinuxJones	marcin_ant	umm what do you do during a big download
2005-02-27T07:52:00.000Z	marcin_ant	LinuxJones	sure - but anyway how much ram is enough?
2005-02-27T07:53:00.000Z	LinuxJones	marcin_ant	nice
2005-02-27T10:03:00.000Z	LinuxJones	marcin_ant	yes
2005-02-27T10:04:00.000Z	marcin_ant	LinuxJones	but I cannot see these variables in "export"
2005-02-27T10:04:00.000Z	marcin_ant	LinuxJones	so I'm not sure if it is safe to remove this file
2005-02-27T10:04:00.000Z	LinuxJones	marcin_ant	what are you trying to do ?
2005-02-27T10:05:00.000Z	marcin_ant	LinuxJones	hmm I just have for example JAVA_HOME in this file
2005-02-27T10:05:00.000Z	marcin_ant	LinuxJones	but I don't have JAVA_HOME in export's output
2005-02-27T10:05:00.000Z	marcin_ant	LinuxJones	and this is why I wonder if ubuntu uses file
2005-02-27T10:07:00.000Z	LinuxJones	marcin_ant	have you checked www.ubuntuguide.org ??
2005-02-27T10:08:00.000Z	marcin_ant	LinuxJones	yes, but why?
2005-02-27T10:08:00.000Z	marcin_ant	LinuxJones	JAVA_HOME?
