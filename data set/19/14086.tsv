2004-11-07T06:31:00.000Z	stvn	jesper	I think the danish support in ubuntu will be more or less similar as it in debian
2004-11-07T06:32:00.000Z	jesper	stvn	it looked quite good, but it didn't seem to install OOo in Danish..
2004-11-07T06:33:00.000Z	jesper	stvn	my Debian does..
2004-11-07T06:33:00.000Z	stvn	jesper	yeah, both ff and OO.o have a different system of internationalisation and is not yet supported
2004-11-07T06:33:00.000Z	stvn	jesper	so you need to chose the language yourself
2004-11-07T06:34:00.000Z	jesper	stvn	Ok.. it's not my own box, I installed Ubuntu for one at an installparty the day before yesterday...
2004-11-07T06:35:00.000Z	jesper	stvn	my own box will come one of the following days.. I think :-)
2004-11-07T06:35:00.000Z	stvn	jesper	just search for -da in synaptic and you get the correct language packages
2004-11-07T06:35:00.000Z	jesper	stvn	Ok..
2004-11-07T06:36:00.000Z	jesper	stvn	Is there a thing like http://packages.debian.org/ for ubuntu?
2004-11-07T06:36:00.000Z	stvn	jesper	don't know really
2004-11-07T06:38:00.000Z	jesper	stvn	I can see that it's not in Debian(testing) either.. .well thanks.
2004-11-07T06:39:00.000Z	stvn	jesper	you can search in apt-get.org for a deb with firefox-da, but it'll prolly conflict with ubuntu's version of ff though
2004-11-07T06:49:00.000Z	stvn	jesper	hoary is supposed to have support for locales for OO.o en ff
2004-11-07T06:50:00.000Z	jesper	stvn	Ok..
2005-03-07T16:44:00.000Z	stvn	jesper	it will make ubuntu unaccasible
2005-03-07T16:45:00.000Z	jesper	stvn	that doesn't matter at the moment. Ubuntu didn't configure X proper either, and he's not geeky enough to do that by himself.
2005-03-07T16:47:00.000Z	stvn	jesper	then it'll restore the windows bootloader yees
2005-03-07T16:47:00.000Z	jesper	stvn	thanks..
