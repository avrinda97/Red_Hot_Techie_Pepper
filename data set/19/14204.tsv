2004-10-20T15:57:00.000Z	tck		im trying to mount a usb key ; not having much luck!
2004-10-20T15:57:00.000Z	tck		/dev/sda isn't availale, how does ubuntu handle it
2004-10-20T15:58:00.000Z	Blissex	tck	in theory it should be fully automatic.
2004-10-20T15:59:00.000Z	Blissex	tck	first check what 'lsusb' says to make sure the device is recognized.
2004-10-20T15:59:00.000Z	Blissex	tck	then check 'cat /proc/scsi/scsi' to see if it is there at all.

2004-10-21T16:03:00.000Z	tck	Blissex	any ideas?
2004-10-21T16:04:00.000Z	Blissex	tck	 on IRC you should not paste more than 3-4 lines.
2004-10-21T16:04:00.000Z	tck		that doesn't help
2004-10-21T16:04:00.000Z	Blissex	tck	in theory 'modprobe usb-storage' should work, but that should have been done automatically by hotplug etc.
2004-10-21T16:05:00.000Z	Blissex	tck	if you want to be helped in general respect IRC rules. Else you will get kicked or banned from channels...
