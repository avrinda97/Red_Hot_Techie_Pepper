2007-04-05T15:00:00.000Z	cables	PhantasyHawk	you have to edit xorg.conf
2007-04-05T15:01:00.000Z	PhantasyHawk	cables	I have it open, what exactly do I change?
2007-04-05T15:01:00.000Z	cables	PhantasyHawk	hold on a sec
2007-04-05T15:02:00.000Z	cables	PhantasyHawk	I can explain, or I can send a link to a guide... I suggest the latter.
