2009-03-17T04:50:00.000Z	Dreamglider		Is there any fix for laggy flash playing in firefox ? Ubuntu 8.10 and hardware drivers activated. Compiz is turned off aswell.
2009-03-17T04:51:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Dreamglider	yeah  Ubuntu's  unoffical version of Firefox can have issues with Flash and stuff like that, how about trying Flash in another browser, such as  Epiphany or Galeon
2009-03-17T04:51:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Dreamglider	they will use the same FLash that Firefox uses
2009-03-17T04:53:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Dreamglider	yep ok, now:  sudo apt-get install galeon epiphany-browser
2009-03-17T04:53:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Dreamglider	then try in those
2009-03-17T04:54:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Dreamglider	oh  yeah epiphany might not add itself to the menu, but you can open it from terminal with epiphany-browser once installed
2009-03-17T04:55:00.000Z	Dreamglider	sebsebseb	alright ill give it a spin.
2009-03-17T04:55:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Dreamglider	and I have my own issues with Flash  or even the alternatives to the Flash player,  in Ubuntu's Firefox, but  it wil work good in those two other browsers
2009-03-17T04:56:00.000Z	Dreamglider	sebsebseb	do i need to install flash for the browser or does it use the same as firefox uses ?
2009-03-17T04:57:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Dreamglider	see the message I just put to the other guy as well
2009-03-17T04:58:00.000Z	Dreamglider	sebsebseb	thankyou works fine :) even in fullscreen :)
2009-03-17T04:59:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Dreamglider	see my message again to other guy
2009-03-18T05:39:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Dreamglider	Windows will overwrite your first or only hard disks,  MBR,  and that's the way it is, nothing you can do about that
2009-03-18T05:41:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Dreamglider	Finuxx     Finnish  Unix? :D
2009-03-23T04:05:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Dreamglider	you should warn people like I did  first :) not just give them that link
2009-03-23T04:06:00.000Z	Dreamglider	sebsebseb	true
2009-04-02T01:12:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Dreamglider	maybe with some configuring to get it working properly in Ubuntu,  but  in a Windows virtual machine inside Ubuntu, I expect that would work
2009-04-02T20:24:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Dreamglider	yes
2009-04-19T23:38:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Dreamglider	be cd'd into the folder and sudo dpkg -i  namegoeshere.deb
