2012-02-18T01:11:00.000Z	GriGi		i can  control volume but it gives me nothing
2012-02-18T01:12:00.000Z	jsec	GriGi	terminal, run "alsamixer"
2012-02-18T01:12:00.000Z	GriGi	jsec	Okay, i got alsamixer on, what should i check now?
2012-02-18T01:13:00.000Z	jsec	GriGi	scroll to the right until you see 'Auto-Mute' and let me know if it's enabled or disabled
2012-02-18T01:15:00.000Z	GriGi	jsec	I got Master, [...], Mic Boost, Beep. And then I can't scroll to right. "Beep" is the last position.
2012-02-18T01:15:00.000Z	jsec	GriGi	what version of ubuntu are you on?
2012-02-18T01:15:00.000Z	GriGi		11.10
2012-02-18T01:15:00.000Z	GriGi		I think i didn't have that bug in 10.10
2012-02-18T01:17:00.000Z	jsec	GriGi	ok, alsamixer again and then hit F6
2012-02-18T01:18:00.000Z	GriGi	jsec	I got "(default)" and "HDA Intel", and "enter device name..."
2012-02-18T01:18:00.000Z	jsec	GriGi	select HDA Intel
2012-02-18T01:20:00.000Z	GriGi	jsec	Okay, you thing that could help?
2012-02-18T01:20:00.000Z	GriGi	jsec	I got HDA Intel, and still can't see any "Auto-Mute"
2012-02-18T01:21:00.000Z	jsec	GriGi	if HDA has been selected, go ahead and try to play some sound
2012-02-18T01:23:00.000Z	GriGi	jsec	Yeah, it works. But I have to restart netbook to check. Because I don't got sound until i plugin and plugout something to minijack, then build in speakers works. Im gonna leave, and check that. Thanks for advices.
