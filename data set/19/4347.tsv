2009-07-31T03:47:00.000Z	ibeekman		hey I was following this howto but I can't import my public pgp key: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1146081
2009-07-31T03:47:00.000Z	ibeekman		but my key won't import
2009-07-31T03:47:00.000Z	ibeekman		I just want my public key...
2009-07-31T03:48:00.000Z	lstarnes	ibeekman	what error do you get?
2009-07-31T03:50:00.000Z	ibeekman	lstarnes	But this error goes silent unless I run seahorse from a shell explicitly
2009-07-31T03:50:00.000Z	lstarnes	ibeekman	have you tried using the name associated with the key instead of its ID?
2009-07-31T03:53:00.000Z	ibeekman	lstarnes	how?  I have been using the seahorse gui to import the key after publishing it publicly to the ubuntu key server
2009-07-31T03:54:00.000Z	lstarnes	ibeekman	are you trying to download the key from the key server?
2009-07-31T03:55:00.000Z	ibeekman	lstarnes	yes I just want a public version of my pgp key
2009-07-31T03:55:00.000Z	lstarnes	ibeekman	you should already have it
2009-07-31T03:56:00.000Z	lstarnes	ibeekman	you can't publish a key that you don't already have
2009-07-31T03:58:00.000Z	ibeekman	lstarnes	I have my private key but I want a copy of the public key so I can email it to people etc.
2009-07-31T03:58:00.000Z	lstarnes	ibeekman	you already have it
2009-07-31T03:58:00.000Z	lstarnes	ibeekman	when you make a private key, it also makes a public key
2009-07-31T03:59:00.000Z	ibeekman	lstarnes	where is it?
2009-07-31T04:00:00.000Z	lstarnes	ibeekman	it should be under the "my personal keys" tab in seahorse
2009-07-31T04:01:00.000Z	lstarnes	ibeekman	you can also export it in a terminal with gpg -a --export $USER
2009-07-31T04:29:00.000Z	ibeekman	lstarnes	hey sorry, I went away... so I thought a public keyfile would end in .pub not .asc
2009-07-31T04:32:00.000Z	ibeekman	lstarnes	also the command line code you gave me produces this:   gpg: WARNING: nothing exported
