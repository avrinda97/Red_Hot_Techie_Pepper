2008-09-09T16:38:00.000Z	Filthpig		indeed. I believe Ubuntu's main strength is the superior documentation and user mass which provide help for new users. The Ubuntu philosophy is unsurpassed in the open source world - humanity towards others. The distro itself is far from the most advanced or bleeding edge, but it is good enough, stable enough and has documentation for 99% of your problems.
2008-09-09T16:39:00.000Z	Filthpig		that was aimed at ActionParsnip and Joe_le_fourbe, by the way ;)
2008-09-09T16:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Filthpig	thats one aspect of the distro but if something else is needed then its not fantastic
2008-09-09T16:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Filthpig	like gentoo can be very robust and stable but takes time to install but the gentoo support is quite decent
2008-09-09T16:41:00.000Z	Filthpig	ActionParsnip	yes, and the installation procedure is why gentoo will never compete with the likes of ubuntu and mandriva.
2008-09-09T16:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Filthpig	why would any distro compete with another
2008-09-09T16:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Filthpig	its not a competition its getting the distro that suits your needs
2008-09-09T16:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Filthpig	why do you think they are competing in any way?
2008-09-09T16:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Filthpig	you still there?
2008-09-09T16:47:00.000Z	Filthpig	ActionParsnip	well I didn't mean compete in a PC vs. Mac kind of way, but you know, today Ubuntu is the face of open source to th world, like it or not. If you say "open source" to a man on the street, he will think of Firefox and Ubuntu, not Epiphany and Gentoo, if you get my meaning. And I also guess that it is in all major distro's interest to have as big an usergroup as possible as that will only enhance the distro's quality in terms of
2008-09-09T16:50:00.000Z	Filthpig	ActionParsnip	yeah I'm here, jI'm just active on several fronts ;)
2008-09-09T16:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Filthpig	i dont think 1 distro will be dominant or the leader as no users needs are identical, if we all used our computers identically then yes a single OS would work
2008-09-09T16:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Filthpig	unfortunately OSes dont fit human variety hence the thousands of distros of linux
2008-09-09T16:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Filthpig	if you head to www.distrowatch.org you will see the vast multitude of linux and bsd OSes
2008-09-09T16:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Filthpig	most notorious doesnt make it "best"
2008-09-09T16:53:00.000Z	Filthpig	ActionParsnip	indeed, and that's what great about the open source world, people can build their linux/bsd/solaris distro of choice, but 90% of the world just wants something that works, and that's why ubuntu/mandriva/fedora/opensuse has the majority of desktop users today.
2008-09-09T16:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Filthpig	indeed but there are also people who want to play and optomise
2008-09-09T16:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Filthpig	its a whole choice but people seem to be jumping on the ubuntu bandwgon due to great press, much like firefox when it was released on windows
2008-09-09T16:56:00.000Z	Filthpig	ActionParsnip	indeed, and that's a good thing for innovation, I never said ubuntu was best either, I said it had superior backing in terms of documentation, which is why so many newbies have embraced it instead of, say, mandriva
