2006-04-10T12:57:00.000Z	brent		graveman gives me exact same problem
2006-04-10T12:58:00.000Z	brent		what im trying to burn is owned by myself with r-w-x
2006-04-10T12:59:00.000Z	brent		i have read others on the Internet with same issues, but nobody has the fix
2006-04-10T13:00:00.000Z	brent		i dont have graveman anymore. sudo will allow burn i think, but how will i then allow users to burn without sudo? i need which command?
2006-04-10T13:01:00.000Z	brent		this is exactly what i think. im trying to pry the useful information from you people for the fix....so whicch command please?
2006-04-10T13:02:00.000Z	brent		and?
2006-04-10T13:02:00.000Z	brent		already there, then?
2006-04-10T13:03:00.000Z	brent		already is. polpak other apps like nerolinux work. i can burn cds but not with nautilus burn. that is my question
2006-04-10T13:04:00.000Z	brent		this is why i cannot understand, perhaps now you can see why im so perplexed.
2006-04-10T13:04:00.000Z	brent		im no noob either, im trying to pry information that nobody has apparently
2006-04-10T13:06:00.000Z	_jason	brent	ls -l device
2006-04-10T13:18:00.000Z	_jason	brent	are you in the cdrom group?
2006-04-10T13:19:00.000Z	_jason	brent	use k3b or something
2006-04-10T13:20:00.000Z	_jason	brent	I see
2006-04-10T13:22:00.000Z	_jason	brent	well you're in the cdrom group so afaik your permissions are fine on the device
2006-04-10T13:23:00.000Z	brent	_jason	i know, it is an application issue
2006-04-10T13:29:00.000Z	_jason	brent	yes, but I don't use nautilus burner so I don't really know what differs from other programs that would cause your problem
2006-04-10T13:31:00.000Z	brent	_jason	are you using gnomebaker?
2006-04-10T13:31:00.000Z	_jason	brent	yes
