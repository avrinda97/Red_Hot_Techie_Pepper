2012-02-05T10:08:00.000Z	Carolyn		How do I figure out what's going on here? -> dnsmasq: failed to create listening socket for port 53: Permission denied
2012-02-05T10:10:00.000Z	lotuspsychje	Carolyn	what exactly are you trying to do?
2012-02-05T10:12:00.000Z	lotuspsychje	Carolyn	permission denied sounds like no root rights, you running firestarter as root?
2012-02-05T10:14:00.000Z	lotuspsychje	Carolyn	maybe this will help: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1428865
2012-02-05T10:18:00.000Z	lotuspsychje	Carolyn	did you try same settings without firestarter?
2012-02-05T10:22:00.000Z	lotuspsychje	Carolyn	you could try gufw to test if its really a firestarter problem
2012-02-05T10:34:00.000Z	lotuspsychje	Carolyn	still around?
2012-02-05T10:39:00.000Z	lotuspsychje	Carolyn	please repost your question, the real experts are in the house now
2012-02-05T10:45:00.000Z	lotuspsychje	Carolyn	maybe something to find in /var/log
2012-02-05T10:48:00.000Z	lotuspsychje	Carolyn	no router that blocks it?
2012-02-05T10:51:00.000Z	lotuspsychje	Carolyn	you have dhcp server running?

2012-02-05T11:11:00.000Z	lotuspsychje	Carolyn	does your laptop have a broadcom wifi card?
2012-02-05T11:16:00.000Z	lotuspsychje	Carolyn	did you manually config etc/dnsmasq.conf?
