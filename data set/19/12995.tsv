2005-10-19T05:43:00.000Z	Blair		IT DIDN'T CREATE /TARGET/VAR/LOG/BOOTSTRAP.LOG
2005-10-19T05:43:00.000Z	Blair		so why did it tell me to look there for the log?
2005-10-19T05:44:00.000Z	Blair		does anyone know why this release was marked as "stable"?
2005-10-19T05:44:00.000Z	Blair		crap...
2005-10-19T05:44:00.000Z	Blair		now the shell crashed
2005-10-19T05:45:00.000Z	Blair		i think it took a ctrl-C as a quit signal
2005-10-19T05:46:00.000Z	Blair		hmmm
2005-10-19T05:46:00.000Z	Blair		chicken and egg problem
2005-10-19T05:46:00.000Z	Blair		i want to run md5sum on /cdrom...
2005-10-19T05:46:00.000Z	Blair		but it won't treat the iso as a iso when it's burned to a cd
2005-10-19T05:47:00.000Z	dooglus	Blair	use dd to reads the iso as an iso...
2005-10-19T05:47:00.000Z	dooglus	Blair	just as soon as I've refreshed myself...  :)
2005-10-19T05:48:00.000Z	dooglus	Blair	I think that's in.  except it's /dev/cdrom or something like that isn't it?
2005-10-19T05:50:00.000Z	dooglus	Blair	/dev/cdrom
2005-10-19T05:51:00.000Z	dooglus	Blair	you don't have /dev/cdrom?
2005-10-19T05:53:00.000Z	dooglus	Blair	how would you find the md5sum of a CD in Windows?  I wouldn't know how to, other than using Nero or something to read it to disk, then using cygwin's md5sum.exe or some such.
2005-10-19T05:54:00.000Z	dooglus	Blair	http://se.releases.ubuntu.com/5.10/MD5SUMS
2005-10-19T05:54:00.000Z	dooglus	Blair	you can find the correct sums there
2005-10-19T05:55:00.000Z	dooglus	Blair	sounds like a bad burn to me.  try another...
