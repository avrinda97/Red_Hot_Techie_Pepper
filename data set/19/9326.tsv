2006-11-21T16:23:00.000Z	Ferret_		Hey I got a question here, I've been looking around on the forum and couldn't find an answer.
2006-11-21T16:23:00.000Z	Ferret_		I'm trying to put Ubuntu on my iBook and the CD drive on it is dead so I can't use the CDs, all I got is an iPod, is it possible to install from that one?
2006-11-21T16:24:00.000Z	dougsko	Ferret_	if you can boot from a usb device, yes

2006-11-21T16:37:00.000Z	Ferret_	dougsko	- I don't want to install linux on the iPod, I want to be able to install -from- it. Like some how copy the CD-image of the install CD to the iPod and install on the iBooks own hardisk.
2006-11-21T16:38:00.000Z	dougsko	Ferret_	yes i know, thats what that how to is for
2006-11-21T16:38:00.000Z	dougsko	Ferret_	you have to put it on it before you can boot from it and install form it
2006-11-21T16:40:00.000Z	dougsko	Ferret_	maybe you can just put the .iso file of the install disk on it and boot from the ipod
2006-11-21T16:41:00.000Z	Ferret_	dougsko	- Well I assume I gotta make the drive bootable some how.
2006-11-21T16:42:00.000Z	dougsko	Ferret_	right, there a section in that last link i posted, about making it bootable
2006-11-21T16:45:00.000Z	dougsko	Ferret_	what OS you running now?
2006-11-21T16:47:00.000Z	Ferret_	dougsko	- On the iBook it's OS X 10.4.6 (I think) it's 10.4.something at any rate.
2006-11-21T16:47:00.000Z	dougsko	Ferret_	you might be able to try this method: http://ftp.ubuntulinux.org/ubuntu/dists/warty/main/installer-i386/current/doc/manual/en/apcs03.html
