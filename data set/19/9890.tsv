2007-02-05T14:47:00.000Z	xhaan		does anyone know a way to take like 100 files with spaces in thier names and change the spaces to hyphens or underscores? :p
2007-02-05T14:48:00.000Z	Jowi	xhaan	"rename 's/ /_/r' *.mp3"
2007-02-05T14:54:00.000Z	Jowi	xhaan	sorry, my mistake "rename 's/ /_/g' *.mp3" (or whatever filename)
2007-02-05T14:55:00.000Z	Jowi	xhaan	the "g" is to make the rename not stop at the first space
2007-02-05T14:56:00.000Z	xhaan	Jowi	hmm.. do i need a special program to use that? didnt work
2007-02-05T14:57:00.000Z	Jowi	xhaan	what do you mean? what error did you get?
2007-02-05T14:58:00.000Z	xhaan	Jowi	no error, just didnt work
2007-02-05T14:58:00.000Z	Jowi	xhaan	what did you type?
2007-02-05T14:58:00.000Z	Jowi	xhaan	no error means it work. maybe you typed something wrong.
2007-02-05T14:59:00.000Z	Jowi	xhaan	that will replace all spaces in the filename with underscores.
2007-02-05T14:59:00.000Z	Jowi	xhaan	that's what you asked for :)
2007-02-05T15:01:00.000Z	Jowi	xhaan	make sure you stand in the directory where you want to rename and try again.
2007-02-05T15:02:00.000Z	Jowi	xhaan	so check the filepermissions to make sure they are not write protected.
2007-02-05T15:02:00.000Z	Jowi	xhaan	no idea if it works with symlinks (never tried)
2007-02-05T15:04:00.000Z	Jowi	xhaan	"rename 's/TextToReplace/ReplaceWithThis/g' filenamepattern" works fine.
2007-02-05T15:06:00.000Z	xhaan	Jowi	thats exactly how im doing it... oh well, its no big deal :0
2007-02-05T15:07:00.000Z	Jowi	xhaan	the files are in your homedir?
2007-02-05T15:08:00.000Z	Jowi	xhaan	and it's not an ntfs partition or fat32?
2007-02-05T15:08:00.000Z	Jowi	xhaan	that is strange. no idea why it doesn't work for you...
