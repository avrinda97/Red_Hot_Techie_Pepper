2007-07-21T09:24:00.000Z	taime1		who wants to come to a support channel and get treated this way?
2007-07-21T09:24:00.000Z	taime1		thats funny, because you were WRONG
2007-07-21T09:25:00.000Z	taime1		jordan_u your method worked, his did NOT
2007-07-21T09:26:00.000Z	taime1		i can say that for jordan_u who was correct and NOT an ass
2007-07-21T09:27:00.000Z	taime1		i didnt install any codecs ... they were already installed
2007-07-21T09:27:00.000Z	taime1		what worked was when jordan_u told me to install totem-mozilla
2007-07-21T09:29:00.000Z	taime1		i have NEVER been treated this way in this channel, am i am very disappointed. all that wa required was a simple, "perhaps totem-mozilla will fix the problem" and instead, i got spoken to like an idiot...and bruenig still thinks he was right when he told me to UNinstall totem-mozilla
2007-07-21T09:29:00.000Z	taime1		he WAS wrong... he told me that mozilla-mplayer needed to be installed and totem-mozilla needed to be uninstalled.... but the opposite was true in the end
2007-07-21T09:30:00.000Z	taime1		so i have to say, he was infact, WRONG
2007-07-21T09:30:00.000Z	taime1		it doesnt matter how many times you say im wrong... it doesnt change the fact that bruenig was wrong and jordan_u was right
2007-07-21T09:30:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	taime1	It is time to drop it..
2008-03-06T01:04:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	taime1	Easy enough to change a gdm theme..
2008-03-06T01:05:00.000Z	taime1	Jack_Sparrow	i have edited gdm.conf, and still cannot get it to stop using that ugly orange color
2008-03-06T01:05:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	taime1	there are gdm themes and gtk themes and emerald themes
2008-03-06T01:05:00.000Z	taime1	Jack_Sparrow	i clearly posted "gtk theme"
2008-03-06T01:06:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	taime1	First adjust the attitude.. you said gtk theme that gdm uses which is not correct.
2008-03-06T01:11:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	taime1	Personally, I used drag and drop of a tar gdm theme onto the gdm login window manager for the main login theme/screen
2008-03-06T01:11:00.000Z	taime1	Jack_Sparrow	heh... still didnt get what i said.. im not trying to sound rude... my question is not about the gdm theme.. but the gtk theme behind it.
2008-04-29T22:30:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	taime1	all new xorg
