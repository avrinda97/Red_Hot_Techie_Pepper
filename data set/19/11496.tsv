2006-07-09T13:19:00.000Z	JuhazOne		maybe there's now someone who could help me with my problem?
2006-07-09T13:19:00.000Z	JuhazOne		grub doesn't seem to find my new serial ata drive when i try to boot from it
2006-07-09T13:19:00.000Z	JuhazOne		it's probably because i don't know what the (hdX,Y) code is
2006-07-09T13:20:00.000Z	JuhazOne		so... is there a way to find out how BIOS (or whatever) maps those drives?
2006-07-09T13:20:00.000Z	samuli	JuhazOne	first 0 = hda, second the partition. So hda1 = hd0,0 in grub and so on.
2006-07-09T13:21:00.000Z	JuhazOne	samuli	yes i know that
2006-07-09T13:22:00.000Z	samuli	JuhazOne	Isn't it still hd0?
2006-07-09T13:23:00.000Z	samuli	JuhazOne	Okay. I don't know then.
2006-07-09T13:27:00.000Z	samuli	JuhazOne	what's in your /boot/grub/device.map?
2006-07-09T13:28:00.000Z	JuhazOne	samuli	originally on this installation there was only (hd0)   /dev/hda
2006-07-09T13:29:00.000Z	samuli	JuhazOne	try making hd0 /dev/sda and hd1 */hda
2006-07-09T13:30:00.000Z	samuli	JuhazOne	it's worth a try and the problem might lie in how grub can only 'sense' how bios handles the drives I think.
2006-07-09T13:30:00.000Z	JuhazOne	samuli	true
2006-07-09T13:58:00.000Z	samuli	JuhazOne	your tried the re-mapping?
2006-07-09T13:58:00.000Z	JuhazOne	samuli	yeah. i was wondering whether it requires reinstalling grub
2006-07-09T13:58:00.000Z	JuhazOne	samuli	because it didn't appear to have any effect whatsoever on how grub behaved
2006-07-09T13:58:00.000Z	samuli	JuhazOne	I doubt that.
2006-07-09T14:00:00.000Z	samuli	JuhazOne	Anyways, I think so many people are trying to help you out because nobody really knows what the heck's the solution, so good luck :)
2006-07-09T14:00:00.000Z	JuhazOne	samuli	:)
