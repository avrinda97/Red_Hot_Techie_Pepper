2006-10-22T14:34:00.000Z	chronosoft		hmm... i was wondering is there a quick and easy way to access super user/root privileges from a user account?
2006-10-22T14:34:00.000Z	chronosoft		(without having to "switch" to the super user/root account)
2006-10-22T14:35:00.000Z	chuckyp	chronosoft	sudo
2006-10-22T14:35:00.000Z	chuckyp	chronosoft	sure it does.
2006-10-22T14:35:00.000Z	chuckyp	chronosoft	you type sudo whateverprogram    it will prompt you for your password then you type it in and it executes whateverprogram as root
2006-10-22T14:36:00.000Z	chronosoft	chuckyp	i have used linux for a couple of years now
2006-10-22T14:37:00.000Z	chuckyp	chronosoft	ok then what do you want to do exactly because that gives you root?
2006-10-22T14:37:00.000Z	chuckyp	chronosoft	sudo su-
2006-10-22T14:38:00.000Z	chuckyp	chronosoft	sudo mount /dev/i'mafucktard
2006-10-22T14:38:00.000Z	chuckyp	chronosoft	sudo mount /dev/coupleofyears /media/usb
2006-10-22T14:39:00.000Z	chuckyp	chronosoft	or just sudo su-  sudo -i or sudo -s and you will have root.  ctrl+d to leave.
2006-10-22T14:40:00.000Z	chuckyp	chronosoft	what?  I'm sorry I'm a little tired.
2006-10-22T14:40:00.000Z	chuckyp	chronosoft	yeap works fine
2006-10-22T14:41:00.000Z	chuckyp	chronosoft	you just have to enter the original users password when it prompts you not the new one
2006-10-22T14:41:00.000Z	chuckyp	chronosoft	using edgy here and no problems with sudo
2006-10-22T14:41:00.000Z	chronosoft	chuckyp	i did
2006-10-22T14:41:00.000Z	chuckyp	chronosoft	well then you have a problem with sudo.
2006-10-22T14:42:00.000Z	chuckyp	chronosoft	 you may want to ask in #ubuntu+1 why sudo isn't working.
