2006-09-19T07:32:00.000Z	Samuli^		adept And kynaptic :)
2006-09-19T07:32:00.000Z	Samuli^		I'm pretty sure there's kynaptic in the repos :)
2006-09-19T07:33:00.000Z	Sanne	Samuli^	that may very well be. I stopped looking because I wanted to use Synaptic anyway.
2006-09-19T07:33:00.000Z	Samuli^	Sanne	I kinda liked adept.
2006-09-19T07:35:00.000Z	Sanne	Samuli^	Synaptic has this... I prefer Synaptic mainly because it keeps an install history. I didn't find such a thing in Adept.
2006-09-19T07:35:00.000Z	Samuli^	Sanne	it does?
2006-09-19T07:35:00.000Z	Sanne	Samuli^	I will tell you in a sec
2006-09-19T07:35:00.000Z	Samuli^	Sanne	I rarely use synaptic either though, comman line is goood :)
2006-09-19T07:36:00.000Z	Samuli^	Sanne	ok, so I found it already.
2006-09-19T07:36:00.000Z	Sanne	Samuli^	the buttons on the left side at the bottom, one of them is "status". Click that, then you can choose "Installed" in the left column. I use it all the time.
2006-09-19T07:37:00.000Z	Sanne	Samuli^	actually, I prefer command line apt, since I raised myself on it :), but as I said, I just love the install history of Synaptic, so I do all actual installs through it.
2006-09-19T07:38:00.000Z	Samuli^	Sanne	yes.
2006-09-20T08:43:00.000Z	Sanne	Samuli^	64bit Ubuntu is pretty nice, you only need to do just a few things by hand, wait a sec for a link.
2006-09-20T08:43:00.000Z	Sanne	Samuli^	lots of help here (and also search the wiki for 64bit): http://www.ubuntuforums.org/forumdisplay.php?f=134
2006-09-20T08:46:00.000Z	Samuli^	Sanne	do you think I can just install the 64bit kernel with apt and make grub entry for both 32 and 64?
2006-09-20T08:47:00.000Z	Sanne	Samuli^	I bet you can do that, but I don't know if it will work if you don't have a 64bit Ubuntu... I wouldn't do that personally before making very sure. Maybe ask in the forums.
2006-09-20T08:48:00.000Z	Samuli^	Sanne	I'm guessing I'd need 64bit libraries etc. etc. too.
2006-09-20T08:49:00.000Z	Sanne	Samuli^	yeah, that's what I'm assuming also. I have a 64bit Kubuntu which works fine except those apps not yet here for 64bit which have to be installed "by hand", but work fine nevertheless.
