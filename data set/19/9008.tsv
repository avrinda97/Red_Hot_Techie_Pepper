2007-01-06T12:30:00.000Z	untung		<christ> sorry, i am new too in Ubuntu

2007-01-06T12:33:00.000Z	untung		hi, i installed monodevelop using sypnatic package but monodevelop doesnt show up in the application. can anyone help?
2007-01-06T12:34:00.000Z	fami_	untung	can you start it from the command prompt?
2007-01-06T12:35:00.000Z	fami_	untung	try opening up the terminal and typing the name of the application
2007-01-06T12:35:00.000Z	fami_	untung	or, conversely use Alt<F2> and enter the name of the program into the run box
2007-01-06T12:36:00.000Z	fami_	untung	if that works, then adding the program to the applications menu via alacarte is easy
2007-01-06T12:37:00.000Z	fami_	untung	you'll have to find the monodevelop binary and see what command is necessary to run it
2007-01-06T12:38:00.000Z	fami_	untung	unfortunately, I'm not familiar with monodevelop, so I can't address any issues other than how to add stuff to the applications menu :(
2007-01-06T12:39:00.000Z	fami_	untung	sometimes programs installed via synaptic don't show up in the applications menu. They have to be added manually
2007-01-06T12:40:00.000Z	fami_	untung	maybe. do a search for it or check the various */bin folders
2007-01-06T12:41:00.000Z	fami_	untung	but once you have the command necessary to launch the binary, you simply need to open alacarte and tell it what the command is that runs the application, where you want to put the link for it, and what icon you want to use :D
