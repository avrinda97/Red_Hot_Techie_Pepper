2008-07-29T23:25:00.000Z	bonez45		I have a system running etch.. I download the .iso and burn it and then try to load.. it gets so far and then does a kernel panic... how do I get past such a challenge?
2008-07-29T23:25:00.000Z	genii	bonez45	You burnt the ubuntu iso?
2008-07-29T23:26:00.000Z	bonez45	genii	YES, I burnt the .iso
2008-07-29T23:27:00.000Z	genii	bonez45	PErhaps check the kernel load line options used in etch and apply the same kernel options when booting from the livecd.
2008-07-29T23:27:00.000Z	genii	bonez45	Also minimum specs met? 256Mb ram, etc etc
2008-07-29T23:27:00.000Z	bonez45	genii	will the ubuntu disk allow me to set those specific boot parameters?
2008-07-29T23:28:00.000Z	bonez45	genii	ok, how do I check my RAM?
2008-07-29T23:28:00.000Z	genii	bonez45	Yes. Something like f5 or f6 at cd menu then add whatever appropriate kernel options at end of line (before the --- )
2008-07-29T23:28:00.000Z	genii	bonez45	You don't know how much ram your box has ? ;)
2008-07-29T23:29:00.000Z	bonez45	genii	well, I havent' looked or check that box in a while... I meant, can I check it with /proc/mem or something?
2008-07-29T23:31:00.000Z	bonez45	genii	looks like I have 500 mb RAM in that machine..
2008-07-29T23:31:00.000Z	genii	bonez45	OK. So enough to run the livecd. Likely then some idiosyncratic kernel option then
2008-07-29T23:33:00.000Z	genii	bonez45	eg:  look at the kernel line which currently loads your etch and make note of the options used. Use the same options off the ubuntu livecd kernel load line
2009-01-03T10:37:00.000Z	genii	bonez45	Lack of an internet connection?
2009-01-03T10:38:00.000Z	bonez45	genii	fine, but I can ping that same IP for mirrors.xmission.com JUST fine.. would I be able to do that, sans internet connection?
2009-01-03T10:40:00.000Z	genii	bonez45	Try surf to http://mirrors.xmission.com/ubuntu/dists/hardy              <or ibex or so>
2009-01-03T10:41:00.000Z	bonez45	genii	 that brings up a menu listing main, multiverse, restricted and universe...
2009-01-03T10:41:00.000Z	genii	bonez45	Then check your sources.list entry for that repository
2009-01-03T10:41:00.000Z	genii	bonez45	Probably malformed
