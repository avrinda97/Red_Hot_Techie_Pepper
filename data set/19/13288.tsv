2006-05-20T08:43:00.000Z	AlinuxOS	ahmad	if you want to download faster, and connet faster, you must open TCP 4662 port on our router.
2006-05-20T08:44:00.000Z	AlinuxOS	ahmad	here you can test our port 4662 http://www.amule.org/testport.php
2006-05-20T08:45:00.000Z	AlinuxOS	ahmad	no on router.
2006-05-20T08:46:00.000Z	AlinuxOS	ahmad	yes
2006-05-20T08:47:00.000Z	AlinuxOS	ahmad	IP to use is your network cards IP
2006-05-20T08:47:00.000Z	AlinuxOS	ahmad	any name "aMule" for example.
2006-05-20T08:47:00.000Z	AlinuxOS	ahmad	it will not work if you have DHCP enablet. It's better if you use static IP
2006-05-20T08:50:00.000Z	AlinuxOS	ahmad	no I don't use IM
2006-05-20T08:51:00.000Z	AlinuxOS	ahmad	I'll help you tommorow, or with google "name of your router port open howto"
