2008-03-21T03:26:00.000Z	urlwolf		my sudo doesn't work :)
2008-03-21T03:26:00.000Z	urlwolf		I did apt-get install sudo
2008-03-21T03:27:00.000Z	urlwolf		but when using it, it ask for a password, but drops you on the command line without doing anything
2008-03-21T03:27:00.000Z	urlwolf		no, I mean I tried to get package sudo
2008-03-21T03:27:00.000Z	urlwolf		but it's not working
2008-03-21T03:27:00.000Z	bazhang	urlwolf	what package do you want to install?
2008-03-21T03:27:00.000Z	urlwolf		sudo
2008-03-21T03:28:00.000Z	urlwolf	bazhang	package sudo
2008-03-21T03:28:00.000Z	urlwolf		believe it or not, my system came without sudo
2008-03-21T03:28:00.000Z	bazhang	urlwolf	that is not something you need to install
2008-03-21T03:28:00.000Z	urlwolf		I did ask (I'm using andlinux, ubuntu based) and it did come without sudo
2008-03-21T03:29:00.000Z	urlwolf		it's my computer
2008-03-21T03:29:00.000Z	urlwolf		I'm root
2008-03-21T03:29:00.000Z	bazhang	urlwolf	wrong channel for you then
2008-03-21T03:29:00.000Z	urlwolf		why?
2008-03-21T03:29:00.000Z	urlwolf		andlinux is ubuntu-based
2008-03-21T03:29:00.000Z	bazhang	urlwolf	read the /topic
2008-03-21T03:30:00.000Z	bazhang	urlwolf	install the *real deal* and then we can talk
