2010-06-08T21:16:00.000Z	Milp_main		I urgently need all the stuff required to compile things for the kernel version 2.6.29 on an arm device, where can i find the kernel headers for that?
2010-06-08T21:17:00.000Z	acicula	Milp_main	are you on ubuntu?
2010-06-08T21:17:00.000Z	Milp_main	acicula	yes
2010-06-08T21:18:00.000Z	acicula	Milp_main	apt-get install build-essential, and you may have to explicitly install the headers package for your kernel version, use apt-cache search to locate those
2010-06-08T21:19:00.000Z	Milp_main	acicula	well i tried searching for it on aptitude and it couldnt find anything with my kernel version, only 2.6.31 and upwards
2010-06-08T21:19:00.000Z	acicula	Milp_main	are you using a stock kernel?
2010-06-08T21:19:00.000Z	Milp_main	acicula	no
2010-06-08T21:20:00.000Z	acicula	Milp_main	then the headers wont be packaged either, you'll have to symlink the headers in /usr/include
2010-06-08T21:20:00.000Z	Milp_main	acicula	uuh what?
2010-06-08T21:21:00.000Z	acicula	Milp_main	if you are using a custom kernel then you will not find the header files packaged for it, unless you run a custom version of a prepackaged kernel
2010-06-08T21:21:00.000Z	Milp_main	acicula	thats why im asking if there was an ubuntu version running version 2.6.29, so i could just use those headers for it, do you happen to know which version used it?
2010-06-08T21:23:00.000Z	acicula	Milp_main	9.04 shipped with .28 and karmic shipped with .31, so no
2010-06-08T21:23:00.000Z	Milp_main	acicula	hm where could i get a set of headers from then?
2010-06-08T21:23:00.000Z	acicula	Milp_main	they are in the kernel source package you build from
2010-06-08T21:25:00.000Z	acicula	Milp_main	if all this is confusing to you perhaps consider switching to prepackaged kernels for you?
2010-06-08T21:25:00.000Z	Milp_main	acicula	thats not possible for that device, ubuntu only runs inside a chroot environment
2010-06-08T21:27:00.000Z	acicula	Milp_main	yeah you'll have to get the sourcepackage that build your kernel(oogle), and then either manually setup the headers via symlinking, or package the kernel (!compile) as debs and install the headers as deb.
2010-06-08T21:27:00.000Z	Milp_main	acicula	or could i just throw all the sources into the folder of the program i want to compile every time i want to compile something? (the lazy but messy way)
2010-06-08T21:27:00.000Z	acicula	Milp_main	well the build chain expects to find headers
