2006-11-01T10:55:00.000Z	leafw		any clues on how to list the hardware specs in gnome or in a terminal?
2006-11-01T10:56:00.000Z	leafw		like, whether this machine has 2 processors or one (can't shut it off to find out and dmesg didn't help)
2006-11-01T10:56:00.000Z	LjL	leafw	perhaps "cat /etc/cpuinfo"
2006-11-01T10:57:00.000Z	LjL	leafw	perhaps "cat /proc/cpuinfo" i meant
2006-11-01T10:58:00.000Z	leafw	LjL	: thanks, the /proc/cpuinfo list it all
2006-11-02T16:09:00.000Z	LjL	leafw	i dunno, but i'd be surprised if DRI was supported over SSH...?
2006-11-02T16:09:00.000Z	leafw	LjL	: should be
2006-11-02T16:09:00.000Z	leafw	LjL	: this error was not there in dapper.
2006-11-09T09:50:00.000Z	LjL	leafw	that's xserver-xorg, and it won't remove much i'm afraid
2006-11-09T09:50:00.000Z	leafw	LjL	: with autoremove it will, for those packages were indirectly isntalled
2006-11-09T09:51:00.000Z	LjL	leafw	i'm not going to try that, but i doubt it... removing ubuntu-desktop won't make autoremove remove anything else
2006-11-09T09:52:00.000Z	leafw	LjL	thijs : to ensure the shot, do a dpkg-quer -W --showformat='${Package}\t${Status}\n' | grep "ok installed" | grep "xserver" | less
2006-11-19T11:17:00.000Z	leafw	LjL	: I bet, kubuntu works and ubuntu fails at putting my laptop to sleep
2006-11-19T11:17:00.000Z	LjL	leafw	sort of the opposite for me :)
2006-11-19T11:17:00.000Z	leafw	LjL	: I wish it worked in both
2008-11-09T20:11:00.000Z	LjL	leafw	i don't know, but try #eeepc
2008-11-09T20:12:00.000Z	LjL	leafw	also, #ubuntu-eeepc is the channel of the ubuntu eeepc compatibility team (but not the channel for alternative distributions)
2009-05-25T01:35:00.000Z	LjL	leafw	#ubuntu-eeepc
2009-05-25T01:35:00.000Z	leafw	LjL	thanks
