2005-07-23T11:52:00.000Z	bojangles		man that is hard to believe that India is pirating windows at 80%...I always thought they were the most honest people and that they would each pay $20,000 for a basic version of MS enterprise
2005-07-23T11:52:00.000Z	robotgeek	bojangles	lol
2005-07-23T11:53:00.000Z	bojangles	robotgeek	what is so funny...the prices escalate far beyond that per person for a basic enterprise system plus a few enhancements
2005-07-23T11:54:00.000Z	robotgeek	bojangles	how did u arrive at the 80% figure?
2005-07-23T11:54:00.000Z	bojangles	robotgeek	that is what this dude said earlier in here.
2005-07-23T11:54:00.000Z	robotgeek	bojangles	sorry, just came in :). I think the figure would be much higher, though
2005-07-23T11:55:00.000Z	bojangles	robotgeek	well i can't understand why they don't each pay the $20,000 to get started and be honest.
2005-07-23T11:55:00.000Z	robotgeek	bojangles	i think it's difficult if that represents your life savings!
2005-07-23T11:56:00.000Z	bojangles	robotgeek	that is no excuse...they know that MS is on the side of "intellectual robbery....i mean property"
2005-07-23T12:23:00.000Z	robotgeek	bojangles	i am from india. I am now studying in the US, but I did not know anyone who has a legal copy of windows
2005-07-23T12:24:00.000Z	bojangles	robotgeek	you mean nobody wants to pay MS $20,000 for a legal copy of windows
2005-07-23T12:24:00.000Z	robotgeek	bojangles	well, lemme see...no!
2005-07-23T12:39:00.000Z	bojangles	robotgeek	it is not just selling all the chips now...but they will lock in future sales because the chip buyers will want to maintain backward compatibility
2005-07-23T13:31:00.000Z	robotgeek	bojangles	for the n'th time. cause they can't afford it!
2005-07-24T08:34:00.000Z	robotgeek	bojangles	there's a way to disable the logo
2005-07-24T08:35:00.000Z	bojangles	robotgeek	well anyway who needs it....kile works great.
2005-07-24T08:35:00.000Z	bojangles	robotgeek	and so does gnumeric
2005-07-24T11:10:00.000Z	bojangles	robotgeek	redhat is not gpl...they are opensource plus they include some proprietary stuff....so you cannot redistribute it
2005-07-24T11:11:00.000Z	bojangles	robotgeek	they can sue your but off if you try to redistribute thier CDs....they are opensource at best not gpl
