2006-07-05T09:19:00.000Z	beerfan	fowlduck	just simple graphics. gimp is seriously gimped imo :-)
2006-07-05T09:20:00.000Z	fowlduck	beerfan	tuxpaint, kpaint?
2006-07-05T09:20:00.000Z	fowlduck	beerfan	karbon14?
2006-07-05T09:20:00.000Z	fowlduck	beerfan	inkscape
2006-07-05T09:20:00.000Z	fowlduck	beerfan	go search on sourceforge.net
2006-07-05T09:20:00.000Z	beerfan	fowlduck	wow, thanks for all the names
2006-07-05T09:21:00.000Z	fowlduck	beerfan	no problem :)
2006-07-05T09:22:00.000Z	beerfan	fowlduck	I guess a lot of those are kde apps
2006-07-05T09:22:00.000Z	fowlduck	beerfan	i'm in kde, was just spouting what I knew
2006-07-05T09:23:00.000Z	beerfan	fowlduck	np. I tried out krita but it doesn't seem to integrate with gnome very well so I figured all kde apps don't
2006-07-05T09:24:00.000Z	fowlduck	beerfan	yeah, integration is the key word.  They work well in gnome, just don't integrate so well
2006-07-05T09:28:00.000Z	fowlduck	beerfan	you there?
2006-07-05T09:28:00.000Z	beerfan	fowlduck	yeah still here
2006-07-05T09:28:00.000Z	fowlduck	beerfan	http://sourceforge.net/softwaremap/trove_list.php?form_cat=106
2006-07-05T09:29:00.000Z	fowlduck	beerfan	in sourceforge it's all their graphcis editors.  It may take some digging but you'll find some good stuff
2006-07-05T09:29:00.000Z	beerfan	fowlduck	thanks much
2006-07-05T09:34:00.000Z	fowlduck	beerfan	more goodness, but some overlap.  I think this seems higher-qualty: http://freshmeat.net/browse/108/
