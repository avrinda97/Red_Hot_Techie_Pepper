2007-11-25T04:07:00.000Z	macogw	sidncoke	you could also use the i810 driver.  both have 3d perfectly.
2007-11-25T04:07:00.000Z	macogw	sidncoke	chess isnt a 3d game, afaik...
2007-11-25T04:07:00.000Z	macogw	sidncoke	are you sure your xorg.conf says intel not vesa?
2007-11-25T04:08:00.000Z	macogw	sidncoke	i dont trust the gui setup thing.  it's lied to me on what driver is in use before
2007-11-25T04:08:00.000Z	macogw	sidncoke	there isnt a 945 driver
2007-11-25T04:08:00.000Z	macogw	sidncoke	there's i810 which works for all intel before 965
2007-11-25T04:08:00.000Z	macogw	sidncoke	and there's intel which works for all of them
2007-11-25T04:10:00.000Z	sidncoke	macogw	will figure it out but one more question.....what good applications can I find for a Digital DJ on linux?
