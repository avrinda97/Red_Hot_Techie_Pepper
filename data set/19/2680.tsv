2010-02-01T07:41:00.000Z	lolhalplz		Figured out that ubuntu picks up my wireless card, which is Atheros AR8132.
2010-02-01T07:41:00.000Z	lolhalplz		But it's not working.
2010-02-01T07:41:00.000Z	lolhalplz		HELP.
2010-02-01T07:43:00.000Z	danbhfive	lolhalplz	what have you done to see that it is picked up but not working?
2010-02-01T07:45:00.000Z	danbhfive	lolhalplz	what is a system test?
2010-02-01T07:45:00.000Z	lolhalplz	danbhfive	System, Administration, System Testing.
2010-02-01T07:46:00.000Z	danbhfive	lolhalplz	so, does it work?  can you connect?
2010-02-01T07:48:00.000Z	lolhalplz	danbhfive	No, I can't connect. When I unplugged my ethernet cord my wireless card wouldn't connect to my home connection. I even created a wireless connection to use when it works, it wouldn't connect. My router is up and running. Dunno what's wrong.
2010-02-01T07:50:00.000Z	danbhfive	lolhalplz	is this a fresh install?  what version?
2010-02-01T07:51:00.000Z	lolhalplz	danbhfive	Yes, it's Ubuntu netbook remix 9.10.
2010-02-01T07:52:00.000Z	lolhalplz	danbhfive	Did you get my reply?
2010-02-01T07:53:00.000Z	danbhfive	lolhalplz	yeah, but i don't know.  Im playing with that testing app you pointed out.  Have you tried configuring your card through network manager?
2010-02-01T07:54:00.000Z	lolhalplz	danbhfive	Network Manager? Do you mean Network Connections?
2010-02-01T07:55:00.000Z	danbhfive	lolhalplz	there should be a small icon on the top right bar of your screen
2010-02-01T07:58:00.000Z	lolhalplz	danbhfive	Yes.
2010-02-01T07:58:00.000Z	lolhalplz	danbhfive	Oh, no I haven't.
2010-02-01T07:59:00.000Z	danbhfive	lolhalplz	also, you can try: iwconfig     and sudo iwlist <IFACE> scanning
2010-02-01T07:59:00.000Z	danbhfive	lolhalplz	but yeah, try the app first
2010-02-01T08:00:00.000Z	lolhalplz	danbhfive	Got no wireless extensions for both of em.
