2008-10-20T21:33:00.000Z	GaMbi_DK		I get delay on my typing some times(now).. is this a known problem and what can i do abut it? (after pushing a key it takes time for it to show up)
2008-10-20T21:34:00.000Z	mongolai	GaMbi_DK	 is your hdd swapping at the time of the lag?
2008-10-20T21:35:00.000Z	GaMbi_DK	mongolai	the delay is on every type...
2008-10-20T21:35:00.000Z	mongolai	GaMbi_DK	 how much RAM do you have?
2008-10-20T21:35:00.000Z	GaMbi_DK	mongolai	dosnt stop before I do a relog
2008-10-20T21:35:00.000Z	GaMbi_DK	mongolai	4 gig
2008-10-20T21:37:00.000Z	GaMbi_DK	mongolai	im not running any heavy programs.. my swap is 8 giggggg
2008-10-20T21:38:00.000Z	mongolai	GaMbi_DK	 hmmm. usually input lag is caused by system resources being maxed out. is there a runaway process somewhere? Did you configure swap manually?
2008-10-20T21:39:00.000Z	GaMbi_DK	mongolai	no runaways .. config swap? :S
2008-10-20T21:39:00.000Z	mongolai	GaMbi_DK	 what's top have to say about load average, mem use, swap use, and cpu use?
2008-10-20T21:41:00.000Z	GaMbi_DK	mongolai	CPU is at 5% and 7% ~ mem is 15% stable swa 0.1% stable
2008-10-20T21:43:00.000Z	GaMbi_DK	mongolai	4 GiB ram 2x2.66GHZ
2008-10-20T21:44:00.000Z	mongolai	GaMbi_DK	 hmmm. the only other thing I can think of is perhaps an X issue, or video driver... Does input work in avirtual terminal -- ie Ctrl+Alt+f1?
2008-10-20T21:44:00.000Z	GaMbi_DK		yeeeee
2008-10-20T21:44:00.000Z	GaMbi_DK	mongolai	 yea
2008-10-20T21:45:00.000Z	mongolai	GaMbi_DK	 then I'm thinking more of an X or vid driver, but other than that, I dunno.
2008-10-20T21:47:00.000Z	GaMbi_DK	mongolai	had to relog.. couldnt take it anymore :P
2008-10-20T21:49:00.000Z	GaMbi_DK	mongolai	I think Im gonna do a clean install of ubuntu.. guess I did some mistakes earlier... thx for trying tho :)
2008-10-20T21:49:00.000Z	mongolai	GaMbi_DK	 np. Good luck.
