2009-12-18T06:34:00.000Z	edbian	goppp	initramfs is the initial system files that ubuntu puts into ram during the boot up sequence.  I don't really know anything else about it though
2009-12-18T06:35:00.000Z	goppp	edbian	 with my ubuntu wubi install
2009-12-18T06:35:00.000Z	goppp		all I see is
2009-12-18T06:35:00.000Z	goppp		windows as my only choose in wubi
2009-12-18T06:35:00.000Z	goppp		err grub
2009-12-18T06:35:00.000Z	goppp		grub
2009-12-18T06:36:00.000Z	edbian	goppp	I understand.  The grub menu does not show wubi.  No offense but I think you should just install ubuntu in a virtual machine or as a dual boot.  Wubi is just sorta proof of concept / a neat trick.  It's not very functional
2009-12-18T06:36:00.000Z	goppp	edbian	 okay
2009-12-18T06:36:00.000Z	edbian	goppp	It is tough to get good support for wubi cause it's very difficult to debug
