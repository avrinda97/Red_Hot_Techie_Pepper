2009-12-08T08:50:00.000Z	clueless2		anyone knows why Ubunto 9.10 is not reading the full capacity of the HD (250 gigs) but it's only reading 40 gigs.  I cloned using Linux bootable disk clone from a 40.0 gigs.
2009-12-08T08:51:00.000Z	ssmy	clueless2	sounds like it just made a 40g partition on the disk.
2009-12-08T08:51:00.000Z	ssmy	clueless2	you can probably fix it with gparted, but be careful.
2009-12-08T08:53:00.000Z	ssmy	clueless2	install gparted, it is a gui.
2009-12-08T08:54:00.000Z	ssmy	clueless2	it's in system > administration > partition manager i think
2009-12-08T08:54:00.000Z	clueless2	ssmy	..Utility ... ;-)
2009-12-08T08:55:00.000Z	ssmy	clueless2	well, that is a different program, less focused on partion editing. i forgot that they included that with 9.10
2009-12-08T08:55:00.000Z	ssmy	clueless2	let me see. one sec.
2009-12-08T08:56:00.000Z	ssmy	clueless2	yeah, that utility doesn't resize, you need gparted for that.
2009-12-08T08:57:00.000Z	ssmy	clueless2	it's in the system > administration menu as partition editor
2009-12-08T08:58:00.000Z	ssmy	clueless2	nvm, it is just called gparted.
2009-12-08T08:58:00.000Z	ssmy	clueless2	did you install gparted, or gpart? they are not the same.
2009-12-08T08:59:00.000Z	ssmy	clueless2	exactly...
2009-12-08T09:01:00.000Z	clueless2	ssmy	.. so i'm here.  stupid question ..what's the next step ..
2009-12-08T09:06:00.000Z	ssmy	clueless2	if this is the disk you are running the system off of, that is why you can't mess with that partition. if you want to resize you'll need to use the gparted livecd (always useful anyways)
2009-12-08T09:06:00.000Z	clueless2	ssmy	.. u want me to pop that in ?
2009-12-08T09:07:00.000Z	ssmy	clueless2	fire that up and you can use gparted from there to resize the partition.
2009-12-08T09:08:00.000Z	ssmy	clueless2	you can install it if it doesn't.
