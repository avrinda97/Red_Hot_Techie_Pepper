2011-12-20T18:16:00.000Z	ikonia		if you read in more detail
2011-12-20T18:18:00.000Z	ikonia		actually I don't care
2011-12-20T18:18:00.000Z	ikonia		at least the demo programs work too,
2011-12-20T18:19:00.000Z	ikonia		I suspect this is more to do with the fact that ManDay is installing via debootstrap and his build enviornment isn't complete/working
2011-12-20T18:19:00.000Z	ikonia		yeah, I'm guessing, that's why I'm supplying you with factual information,
2011-12-20T18:20:00.000Z	ikonia		I'm out
2011-12-20T18:20:00.000Z	DemonWitch	ikonia	you == complete && utter noob
2012-10-25T15:01:00.000Z	DemonWitch	ikonia	go suck a donkeys dick
2012-11-10T14:58:00.000Z	ikonia	DemonWitch	the documentation
2012-11-10T14:58:00.000Z	DemonWitch	ikonia	you again
2012-11-10T14:59:00.000Z	ikonia	DemonWitch	you may also try command --help see if there is an option to specify
2012-11-10T15:01:00.000Z	ikonia	DemonWitch	neither
2012-11-10T15:01:00.000Z	ikonia	DemonWitch	su  is not used in ubuntu
2012-11-10T15:02:00.000Z	ikonia	DemonWitch	then you should know what you are doing
2012-11-10T15:02:00.000Z	ikonia	DemonWitch	we don't support you using "su" as it's not the ubuntu designed security model
2012-11-10T15:02:00.000Z	ikonia	DemonWitch	you are "allowed" to do what you wish, but we don't support it
2012-11-10T15:03:00.000Z	ikonia	DemonWitch	it's the same funcationality as "su" for root, however within the ubuntu security design
2012-11-10T15:03:00.000Z	ikonia	DemonWitch	man sudo will give you the options (possibly some you've not heard of before)
2012-11-10T15:22:00.000Z	DemonWitch	ikonia	you deserve a watery grave
