2007-09-24T16:51:00.000Z	erUSUL	un_dave	sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart
2007-09-24T16:54:00.000Z	un_dave	erUSUL	thanks
2007-09-24T08:00:00.000Z	erUSUL	un_dave	it is not easy if the driver itself does not print versioning info in tha logs
2007-09-24T08:00:00.000Z	un_dave	erUSUL	hey, thanks for the help before. I think i got my driver installed, but i dont know how to check
2007-09-24T08:01:00.000Z	un_dave	erUSUL	it should have overwritten the ubuntu default one i guess
2007-09-24T08:01:00.000Z	erUSUL	un_dave	no problem, glad i've been of help :)
2007-09-24T08:02:00.000Z	erUSUL	un_dave	yes, check the creation time of the <driver>.ko under /lib/modules/2.6.20-16-generic/ ...
2007-09-24T08:05:00.000Z	un_dave	erUSUL	i'm down as far as /lib/modules/2.6.20-16-generic/kernel/net/ where would it be under there?
2007-09-24T08:06:00.000Z	un_dave	erUSUL	oh, wait drivers
2007-09-24T08:09:00.000Z	un_dave	erUSUL	ok, i'm looking in /lib/modules/2.6.20-16-generic/kernel/drivers/net/ and i see lots of .ko files. one of which is r8168.ko, i think thats the one i installed. and has a change date to match.
2007-09-24T08:10:00.000Z	un_dave	erUSUL	but there's lots of .ko files there. how do i know which one is in use by the system?
2007-09-24T08:10:00.000Z	erUSUL	un_dave	you are only interested in the one you instaled (to see loaded modules use lsmod)
2007-09-24T08:13:00.000Z	un_dave	erUSUL	ok, i see r8168 in lsmod, but it says used by 0 ?
2007-09-24T08:14:00.000Z	erUSUL	un_dave	no other module depends on it...
2007-09-24T08:15:00.000Z	un_dave	erUSUL	 oh. so it still means it's loaded? not that it's loaded, but not being used or something?
2007-09-24T08:16:00.000Z	erUSUL	un_dave	yes it's loaded and the 0 means that other modules do not use it but the module itself is working...
2007-09-24T08:17:00.000Z	un_dave	erUSUL	excellent. so i don't need to reboot or anything?
2007-09-24T08:18:00.000Z	erUSUL	un_dave	no
