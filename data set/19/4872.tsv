2009-01-04T03:24:00.000Z	ccvp		64bit version: May provide additional capabilities to computers that are able to use 64bit software
2009-01-04T03:25:00.000Z	ccvp		hmmm

2009-01-04T03:26:00.000Z	ccvp		is because of "warhammer online"

2009-01-04T03:30:00.000Z	mattbd	ccvp	I think you need to jailbreak your iPhone to use it with Ubuntu
2009-01-04T03:31:00.000Z	mattbd	ccvp	You can get TouchTerm and install OpenSSH on your computer
2009-01-04T03:32:00.000Z	mattbd	ccvp	So you could then access your PC via SSH
2009-01-04T03:32:00.000Z	ccvp	mattbd	i dont spam but the app i use is: tversity.co m
2009-01-04T03:37:00.000Z	mattbd	ccvp	Try a few and see which you prefer
2009-01-04T03:38:00.000Z	mattbd	ccvp	So really all you need is a media server
2009-01-04T03:39:00.000Z	mattbd	ccvp	Media Tomb and Fuppes are the two I've heard of
2009-01-04T03:39:00.000Z	mattbd	ccvp	Fuppes definitely has a web interface
