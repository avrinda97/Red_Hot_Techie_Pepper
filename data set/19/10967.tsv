2007-03-24T14:47:00.000Z	h-bomb		got a question, i have a heavily moddified 6.06 installation (mysql, cacti, php, apache, smokeping, munin, monit) if i upgrade to 6.10 will my system survive? i of course will make a backup first. any thoughts?
2007-03-24T14:48:00.000Z	Flannel	h-bomb	Are all those things in the repositories? (I know most of them are)
2007-03-24T14:49:00.000Z	h-bomb	Flannel	yes, but the onces i have installed are the latest versions, the ones on the repositories are always out of date
2007-03-24T14:49:00.000Z	Flannel	h-bomb	ah, so they're not packages.  Then you may have issues, depending on how you manually installed them.
2007-03-24T14:50:00.000Z	Flannel	h-bomb	Edits of the config isn't the issue, it's the fact that you've installed from source on those packages.
2007-03-24T14:50:00.000Z	Flannel	h-bomb	that's correct.  You must go through Edgy
2007-03-24T14:51:00.000Z	Flannel	h-bomb	Ubuntu software will always be a little out of date version number wise, that's the nature of time based releases.
2007-03-24T14:54:00.000Z	h-bomb	Flannel	understood, but those timed released version were to old and had to many bugs and security holes, so i decied to manually compile and edit them, in hindsight that prolly will have made for a messy system upgrade
2007-03-24T14:54:00.000Z	Flannel	h-bomb	Security holes?  Doubt that.  They keep them pretty well patched.
2007-03-24T14:54:00.000Z	Flannel	h-bomb	You might be interested in some other linux distro.  One that does more of a rolling current release.
2007-03-24T14:55:00.000Z	h-bomb	Flannel	well i love mah ubuntu
2007-03-24T14:55:00.000Z	h-bomb	Flannel	take cacti, still has a old version of it that has serious security holes that allow for remote code execution
2007-03-24T14:56:00.000Z	Flannel	h-bomb	cacti is in universe, you should contact the package maintainer.
2007-03-24T14:56:00.000Z	Flannel	h-bomb	which holes?  are you sure hey're still there and not patched?
2007-03-24T14:57:00.000Z	Flannel	h-bomb	right, the new version won't be backported, but all the patches will.  http://changelogs.ubuntu.com/changelogs/pool/universe/c/cacti/cacti_0.8.6h-1ubuntu3/changelog
2007-03-24T14:58:00.000Z	Flannel	h-bomb	but really, stuff in universe is maintained by individuals, not a security team.  You should contact the maintainer about getting the patches integrated.
2007-03-24T14:59:00.000Z	Flannel	h-bomb	right, well, if you did the former, you wouldn't have to worry about upgrade issues either.
2007-03-24T14:59:00.000Z	h-bomb	Flannel	indeed lol
2007-03-24T15:01:00.000Z	h-bomb	Flannel	this is a work server or anything, just my linux box at home i use to monitor my lap and personal network and all the other computers around the house
