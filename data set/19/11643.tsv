2006-01-20T16:29:00.000Z	j2daosh		hey everybody
2006-01-20T16:29:00.000Z	j2daosh		how do i delete stored information about a network server?
2006-01-20T16:30:00.000Z	j2daosh		ip's, usernames, and passwords have been changed but when i try to connect it keeps telling me to enter the old information and it wont accpt it
2006-01-20T16:31:00.000Z	j2daosh		and why does my copy keep dieing when transfering a large file?
2006-01-20T16:32:00.000Z	j2daosh		i can copy about a gig and then the dl dies. i wouldn't mind so much if i could resume but i cant so it is constantly taking like an hour for nothing
2006-01-20T16:32:00.000Z	j2daosh		anyone know a fix for either of those issues?
2006-01-20T16:33:00.000Z	j2daosh		oh
2006-01-20T16:33:00.000Z	j2daosh		well then yeah... do what _jason said
2006-01-20T16:33:00.000Z	redguy	j2daosh	ask better questions: what program are you talking about for example?
2006-01-20T16:34:00.000Z	j2daosh		red... think u got me confuised with someone else... im having a samba issue... not a proggie issue
2006-01-20T16:34:00.000Z	redguy	j2daosh	hrmm, where did you mention samba?
2006-01-20T16:34:00.000Z	j2daosh		lol nbound well it is but a major one
2006-01-20T16:35:00.000Z	redguy		!tell j2daosh about nicktab
2006-01-20T16:35:00.000Z	j2daosh	redguy	in transfering files back and forth from windows to linux box through network.
2006-01-20T16:36:00.000Z	j2daosh		yeah i know about the autocomplete... works in the terminal too
2006-01-20T16:36:00.000Z	redguy	j2daosh	my question is still valid: what program are you talking about? Windows Explorer? smbclient? smb4k?
2006-01-20T16:36:00.000Z	j2daosh		basically the samba issue is... after about halfway through transfering a large file (5g roughly) is dies
2006-01-20T16:37:00.000Z	j2daosh		lol the technical specs of samba i am unsure of... i just know i have the most current version installed and it halfway works
2006-01-20T16:37:00.000Z	redguy	j2daosh	not all filesystems allow files of this size
