2012-03-28T19:44:00.000Z	Dj_FlyBy		This is so confusing. I have tried everything I can think of but cannot for the life of me get logged into mysql whether by term, webmin, phpmyadmin, etc.... I have tried changing the root password and still nothing. I am LOST!
2012-03-28T19:45:00.000Z	sacarlson	Dj_FlyBy	is the mysql server on the localhost of the system you are trying to access?
2012-03-28T19:46:00.000Z	Dj_FlyBy	sacarlson	yes
2012-03-28T19:48:00.000Z	sacarlson	Dj_FlyBy	if it's localhost,  then why can't you access http://localhost/phpmyadmin ?
2012-03-28T19:48:00.000Z	Dj_FlyBy	sacarlson	 -->  ERROR 1045 (28000): Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost' (using password: YES)
2012-03-28T19:49:00.000Z	sacarlson	Dj_FlyBy	oh you lost the root password or you forgot the user password pair?
2012-03-28T19:50:00.000Z	Dj_FlyBy	sacarlson	nope.... I have NEVER been able to log into mysql in any way at all.... tried changing the root password from Ubuntu's default ways and still nothing
2012-03-28T19:51:00.000Z	sacarlson	Dj_FlyBy	but the login screen of phpmyadmin comes up?
2012-03-28T19:51:00.000Z	Dj_FlyBy	sacarlson	nope. I can't even get through the phpmyadmin install. but via webmin it comes up and I get the same error there and in terminal I get the same error
2012-03-28T19:53:00.000Z	sacarlson	Dj_FlyBy	sound like with whatever method of install or something you have corrupted the lamp set,  just remove --purge the set and start from some know state
2012-03-28T19:53:00.000Z	Dj_FlyBy	sacarlson	not sure what "lamp" is ....
2012-03-28T19:55:00.000Z	sacarlson	Dj_FlyBy	what mneptok: says is true root system and mysql root are not the same
2012-03-28T19:59:00.000Z	sacarlson	Dj_FlyBy	webmin?  oh that's might be what started his problems
2012-03-28T20:00:00.000Z	sacarlson	Dj_FlyBy	adding problems on top of other problems just makes it harder to correct
2012-03-28T20:03:00.000Z	Dj_FlyBy	sacarlson	one can only be "adding" problems if they are aware that something is a problem... I never actually knew that Ubuntu didn't support Webmin. Which sucks. webmin is a good tool as it provides access to everything
2012-03-28T20:06:00.000Z	sacarlson	Dj_FlyBy	I agree webmin would be a good tool if it was supported but at this time it's not so if you fix it and update it then we will all be happy
2012-06-13T18:11:00.000Z	sacarlson	Dj_FlyBy	It could be running the fsck to test your drives after a bad shutdown it might take some time depending on size of disk
2012-06-13T18:12:00.000Z	sacarlson	Dj_FlyBy	oh but that should be displayed
2012-06-13T18:18:00.000Z	sacarlson	Dj_FlyBy	might try hold the shift key at boot to get to the grub menu and try select the rescue mode as an option if it fails to boot
