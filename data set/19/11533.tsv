2006-11-02T11:05:00.000Z	alpha255	noxxle	samba.org has terptstra's book there for you to read
2006-11-02T11:05:00.000Z	alpha255	noxxle	it is really really good
2006-11-02T11:06:00.000Z	alpha255	noxxle	linux passwords and smb passwords are different
2006-11-02T11:06:00.000Z	alpha255	noxxle	the smb.conf file is where quite a bit of the configuration is done
2006-11-02T11:07:00.000Z	alpha255	noxxle	also check out swat ... it's a web based interface for configuring smb
2006-11-02T11:07:00.000Z	alpha255	noxxle	usullay runs on localhost
2006-11-02T11:07:00.000Z	alpha255	noxxle	sudo smbpasswd -a  i think
2006-11-02T11:08:00.000Z	alpha255	noxxle	-a     This option specifies that  the  username  following  should  be added  to  the local smbpasswd file
2006-11-02T11:08:00.000Z	alpha255	noxxle	man smbpasswd
