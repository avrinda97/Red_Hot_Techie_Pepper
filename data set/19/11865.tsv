2005-11-10T09:20:00.000Z	shamox		i'm so alone
2005-11-10T09:21:00.000Z	ompaul	shamox	well is it a G5 question or a server question?
2005-11-10T09:22:00.000Z	ompaul	shamox	lets assume its a Ubuntu question and then if not you can wait on some personwith the same hardware
2005-11-10T09:24:00.000Z	ompaul	shamox	so detail the question and lets see what you have
2005-11-10T09:24:00.000Z	shamox	ompaul	 the facts are that just after installing ubuntu-server ppc64
2005-11-10T09:24:00.000Z	shamox	ompaul	i reboot for the second stage and got a beautifull error message
2005-11-10T09:25:00.000Z	shamox	ompaul	my root partition was not the root partition defined ... I got a root tree with nearly nothing in...
2005-11-10T09:25:00.000Z	shamox	ompaul	so impossible to boot
2005-11-10T09:25:00.000Z	shamox	ompaul	when i look at the right partition, everythings is here to continue the installation
2005-11-10T09:25:00.000Z	shamox	ompaul	i imagine that is an error from the bootimage
2005-11-10T09:26:00.000Z	ompaul	shamox	can you check the md5sum of the image you burnt?
2005-11-10T09:27:00.000Z	shamox	ompaul	and if there was an other chan to go for ubunut-server
2005-11-10T09:27:00.000Z	ompaul	shamox	from what you said that would be the first thing I would do,if you can't do it for a while I would try to install again the most basic system and then come back
