2006-09-15T11:16:00.000Z	hantoo		quick question, wonder if anyone knows it.. if i only get a essid for wireless in uni, i should enter that into /etc/networks/interfaces right? can't seem to get wireless working
2006-09-15T11:17:00.000Z	hantoo		sudo apt-get install build-essential
2006-09-15T11:18:00.000Z	withayanda	hantoo	 what kind of encryption is that wifi network running?  you using dapper?  gnome?  kde?
2006-09-15T11:18:00.000Z	hantoo	withayanda	dapper, fluxbox.
2006-09-15T11:19:00.000Z	hantoo		not quite sure what kind of encryption, they didn't say
2006-09-15T11:19:00.000Z	withayanda	hantoo	 know if the network you're trying to connect to uses wep or wpa encryption?
2006-09-15T11:19:00.000Z	withayanda		ah.
2006-09-15T11:20:00.000Z	hantoo	withayanda	not wep for sure.
2006-09-15T11:20:00.000Z	hantoo		they wanted us to install vpn as well, if that helps
2006-09-15T11:23:00.000Z	withayanda	hantoo	 did "they" give you a password to join the wifi network?  any instructions at all?
2006-09-15T11:23:00.000Z	hantoo		No1Viking: no passwords.
2006-09-15T11:23:00.000Z	hantoo		er
2006-09-15T11:23:00.000Z	hantoo	withayanda	no.. no passwords. they gave instructions for windows, =\
2006-09-15T11:24:00.000Z	withayanda	hantoo	 i'm not familiar with all of the various window managers.  can you run gnome applets w/ fluxbox?
2006-09-15T11:25:00.000Z	withayanda		thanks, xuserx.
2006-09-15T11:26:00.000Z	hantoo	withayanda	s'pose so.
2006-09-15T11:27:00.000Z	withayanda	hantoo	 the only reason that i ask is because configuring wireless is MUCH easier using the networkmanager applet for gnome, or knetworkmanager on kde.
2006-09-15T11:28:00.000Z	hantoo	withayanda	so i've heard. i'll look into it, thanks.
2006-09-15T11:30:00.000Z	hantoo	withayanda	i shall bring the problem to the techguys in uni :D
