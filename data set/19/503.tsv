2012-01-25T00:52:00.000Z	god-workbench		hello, I've not used ubuntu in a few years, I'm more use to using Gentoo, but I have an older machine that I don't have much time to spend compilng on, and don't want to cross compile. so i installed ubuntu from a minimal cd.  i have discovered upstart services. I have tried finding a solution to some kind of configuration interface to upstart
2012-01-25T00:53:00.000Z	god-workbench		but all i can find is manually editing the conf files for it to disable the services. is there not a more convienient way to to this with something similar to BUM?
2012-01-25T00:54:00.000Z	god-workbench		that doesn't pertain to rc.d services ActionParsnip
2012-01-25T00:54:00.000Z	god-workbench		err
2012-01-25T00:54:00.000Z	god-workbench		upstart services*
2012-01-25T00:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	god-workbench	worth a crack
2012-01-25T00:54:00.000Z	god-workbench	ActionParsnip	done tried that crack ;)
2012-01-25T00:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	god-workbench	http://nixcraft.com/shell-scripting/542-ubuntu-linux-control-startup-services-scripts.html  may help

2012-01-25T00:56:00.000Z	god-workbench	ActionParsnip	if that is referring to manually editing the upstart .conf files to comment out the start on line
2012-01-25T01:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	god-workbench	I'd suggest you use xpud then ;) it boots in seconds and will give a browser
2012-01-25T01:03:00.000Z	god-workbench	ActionParsnip	"a browser" isn't chrome
2012-01-25T01:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	god-workbench	it has firefox by default, but you can add chromium if you want
2012-01-25T01:04:00.000Z	god-workbench	ActionParsnip	is xpud a distro or something for ubuntu?
2012-01-25T01:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	god-workbench	no its completely separate but you can use ubuntu debs to make the packages for it
2012-01-25T01:05:00.000Z	god-workbench	ActionParsnip	i don't really see the point in changing anything, the only thing i dont like about this really is the upstart/plymouth stuff. i mean  for an old machine and for compatibility reasons is why i chose the ubuntu minimal cd
2012-01-25T01:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	god-workbench	makes sense
2012-01-25T01:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	god-workbench	most things are written with linux in mind ;)
2012-01-25T01:09:00.000Z	god-workbench	ActionParsnip	thats really not true.. look at most static binary pkgs in taballs, for instance skype.. the libraries that are used for most things are precompiled on ubuntu, making  you have to do nasty things in /usr/lib to get pkgs to work
