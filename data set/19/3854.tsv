2011-04-13T08:21:00.000Z	ejv	UbuntuNoob	i scripted it for you, cuz you're special :)
2011-04-13T08:22:00.000Z	UbuntuNoob	ejv	thanks? i have no clue how to even start this but my whole goal was to learn along the way as to what im doing
2011-04-13T08:23:00.000Z	ejv	UbuntuNoob	try this: http://dpaste.com/531497/
2011-04-13T08:23:00.000Z	ejv	UbuntuNoob	if you use Vixie-Cron to call this script every 5 or 10 minutes, you'll be good to go ;)
2011-04-13T08:25:00.000Z	ejv	UbuntuNoob	there's nothing wrong with learning by reading ;)
2011-04-13T08:27:00.000Z	ejv	UbuntuNoob	verdict? :p
2011-04-13T08:27:00.000Z	UbuntuNoob	ejv	alright i see what it does, but my goal was to have somewhere around 4 pictures that would change depending on the time of day (a light one for morning, bright one for noon, sarker of afternoon, and dark for evening)
2011-04-13T08:28:00.000Z	ejv	UbuntuNoob	you could cron 4 scripts, one for each
2011-04-13T08:28:00.000Z	ejv	UbuntuNoob	and have 4 folders for each
2011-04-13T08:29:00.000Z	UbuntuNoob	ejv	the easiest option here is overwrite the xml file i have downloaded with a prearranged set of pictures, and set the filepaths to the pictures i want, but theres too many timeslots
2011-04-13T08:30:00.000Z	ejv	UbuntuNoob	good luck ;)
2011-04-13T08:32:00.000Z	UbuntuNoob	ejv	what i had planned to do was just have some sort of if then where the if would be a certain period of time and the then would be the picture i wanted 4 separate times
