2007-04-08T10:02:00.000Z	shao_lo		can anyone point me to the solution to the feisty "loading, please wait...check root= bootarg" problem?  I've checked the uuid as some posts suggest and it looks right.
2007-04-08T10:04:00.000Z	reep	shao_lo	have you tried supplying the device node instead of the uuid?
2007-04-08T10:04:00.000Z	shao_lo	reep	you mean use the /dev/hda1?
2007-04-08T10:04:00.000Z	reep	shao_lo	yea, root=/dev/hda1
2007-04-08T10:05:00.000Z	shao_lo	reep	booting up knoppix right now...ill try that..thanks!
2007-04-08T10:05:00.000Z	reep	shao_lo	you can do it from the grub, when you boot
2007-04-08T10:05:00.000Z	reep	shao_lo	when you choose the system to boot, you can hit e to edit...
2007-04-08T10:05:00.000Z	shao_lo	reep	cool..thanks!!
2007-04-08T10:06:00.000Z	reep	shao_lo	so you can sort of try and fail a bit till it hopefully boots
2007-04-08T10:13:00.000Z	shao_lo	reep	hmmm...i get the same behaviour now..except it says /dev/hda1 does not exist
2007-04-08T10:13:00.000Z	shao_lo	reep	do i need to edit the fstab for it to boot this way..it has uuids too
2007-04-08T10:14:00.000Z	reep	shao_lo	hm... could it be /dev/hdb1 or /dev/sda1 maybe?
2007-04-08T10:14:00.000Z	reep	shao_lo	no, you can combine them
2007-04-08T10:15:00.000Z	shao_lo	reep	hda1 is what is in fstab..and its waht i grepped for to find the uuid
2007-04-08T10:15:00.000Z	reep	shao_lo	strange
2007-04-08T10:16:00.000Z	shao_lo	reep	does this issue affect teh stable ubuntus..or just the beta?
2007-04-08T10:17:00.000Z	reep	shao_lo	it sounds like grub doesn't see the harddrive for some reason, don't know if it would be different in another release
2007-04-08T10:18:00.000Z	shao_lo	reep	its an old laptop...ive had mandrake installed on it before...cant remember if it was grub or lil
2007-04-08T10:28:00.000Z	reep	shao_lo	I don't know what else to try, except maybe see if lilo works, this seems to be an ok guide for switching to lilo: http://users.bigpond.net.au/hermanzone/p4.html
