2008-10-11T02:58:00.000Z	Blaenk		hey guys I'm trying to create a system link of a script to my /usr/bin so that I can execute it by just calling 'myscript', I did sudo ln -s trace.py /usr/bin/trace
2008-10-11T02:58:00.000Z	Blaenk		but it doesn't seem to work
2008-10-11T02:59:00.000Z	Blaenk		when I cat the script, /usr/bin/trace, it's empty
2008-10-11T02:59:00.000Z	jrib	Blaenk	do you want a better way to do it or do you want to figure out what you are doing wrong?
2008-10-11T02:59:00.000Z	Blaenk		well both if it's not a bother?
2008-10-11T02:59:00.000Z	Blaenk		any would be greatly appreciated
2008-10-11T03:00:00.000Z	Blaenk		basically I don't want to have a copy of the script
2008-10-11T03:00:00.000Z	Blaenk		because it's a check out of a repository
2008-10-11T03:00:00.000Z	Blaenk		if that makes any sense
2008-10-11T03:00:00.000Z	Blaenk		I'll try
2008-10-11T03:00:00.000Z	Blaenk	LjL	/usr/local/trace didn't work either
2008-10-11T03:00:00.000Z	Blaenk		ok
2008-10-11T03:01:00.000Z	Blaenk		same
2008-10-11T03:01:00.000Z	jrib	Blaenk	you want to do 'ln -s TARGET NAME' where TARGET = the path to trace.py and NAME = /usr/local/bin/target
2008-10-11T03:01:00.000Z	Blaenk		I'm doing that, unless target must be an absolute path
2008-10-11T03:01:00.000Z	jrib	Blaenk	it can be relative, but it has to be in relation to /usr/local/bin/
2008-10-11T03:02:00.000Z	Blaenk		I see
2008-10-11T03:02:00.000Z	Blaenk		so I can't just do trace.py just because it's in the curdir
2008-10-11T03:02:00.000Z	jrib	Blaenk	right
