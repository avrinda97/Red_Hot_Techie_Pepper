2011-05-31T12:09:00.000Z	JamezQ1		Hey guys, what do I need to install to get a usb external terabyte drive to work in ubuntu server
2011-05-31T12:10:00.000Z	ejv	JamezQ1	nothing, all the tools you need are available by default, with the exception of like... xfsprogs for xfs afficanados
2011-05-31T12:11:00.000Z	JamezQ1	ejv	Well, it does not connect.
2011-05-31T12:11:00.000Z	JamezQ1	ejv	It does not show in fdisk -l
2011-05-31T12:11:00.000Z	ejv	JamezQ1	what does the kernel buffer say when you attach the device?
2011-05-31T12:12:00.000Z	JamezQ1	ejv	Eh, how do I check that
2011-05-31T12:13:00.000Z	ejv	JamezQ1	`sudo apt-get install pastebinit' in your terminal then 'dmesg | pastebinit'
2011-05-31T12:17:00.000Z	ejv	JamezQ1	have you been plugging and unplugging the device several times?
2011-05-31T12:17:00.000Z	JamezQ1	ejv	only once
2011-05-31T12:18:00.000Z	JamezQ1	ejv	A person in ubuntu-server says to install ubuntu-standard
2011-05-31T12:25:00.000Z	ejv	JamezQ1	figure it out or need more help? :P
2011-05-31T12:33:00.000Z	JamezQ1	ejv	it works now, thanks
2011-05-31T12:33:00.000Z	ejv	JamezQ1	what was the issue? :)
2011-05-31T12:34:00.000Z	JamezQ1	ejv	Eh, I guess the port went bad, it worked last time, but I switched it to another one and it worked
2011-05-31T12:35:00.000Z	ejv	JamezQ1	yup that would explain your kernel buffer, congrats ;)
2011-05-31T12:35:00.000Z	ejv	JamezQ1	you have to rule stuff like that out for us, in the future :P
2011-05-31T12:35:00.000Z	JamezQ1	ejv	hmm?
2011-05-31T12:35:00.000Z	JamezQ1	ejv	Oh, yea, sorry :(
2011-05-31T12:36:00.000Z	ejv	JamezQ1	:) no worries
