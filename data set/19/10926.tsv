2007-03-03T15:16:00.000Z	valehru		Hey guys, I installed php5 on edgy.  I tried going into a wordpress installation and Im getting the error:
2007-03-03T15:16:00.000Z	valehru		Fatal error: Allowed memory size of 8388608 bytes exhausted (tried to allocate 368640 bytes)
2007-03-03T15:16:00.000Z	eck	valehru	maybe you have a ulimit set
2007-03-03T15:16:00.000Z	valehru	eck	where would that be set?
2007-03-03T15:18:00.000Z	valehru	eck	soz for the spam in the window
2007-03-03T15:18:00.000Z	eck	valehru	do you see the problem :-)
2007-03-03T15:19:00.000Z	eck	valehru	ulimit is provided by bash, the documentation can be read by running 'help ulimit'
2007-03-03T15:19:00.000Z	valehru	eck	not exactly.
2007-03-03T15:20:00.000Z	valehru	eck	stack size or open files?
2007-03-03T15:25:00.000Z	valehru	eck	I just increased the php memory in php.ini to 24M.  That did the trick
2007-03-03T15:25:00.000Z	eck	valehru	i don't know much about PHP, but i know highly threaded applications tend to run out of stack space very quickly
2007-04-04T13:59:00.000Z	eck	valehru	definitely nmap
2007-04-25T09:59:00.000Z	eck	valehru	for mod_php the module is libapache2-mod-php5
2007-04-25T10:01:00.000Z	eck	valehru	check your config then
2007-04-25T10:03:00.000Z	eck	valehru	there should be
2007-04-25T10:03:00.000Z	valehru	eck	there isnt
2007-04-25T10:10:00.000Z	eck	valehru	then your install is borked. i would try some art-get remove --purge's and then reinstall
2007-04-25T10:10:00.000Z	valehru	eck	hmm...well I did have lighttpd installed as well...
2007-04-25T10:11:00.000Z	eck	valehru	it should work nonetheless though
