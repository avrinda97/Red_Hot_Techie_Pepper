2006-07-21T09:04:00.000Z	NthDegree		ok solution:
2006-07-21T09:05:00.000Z	NthDegree		easy way to solve this is to mount the CD under a single mount point
2006-07-21T09:05:00.000Z	NthDegree		manually mount the CD drive
2006-07-21T09:05:00.000Z	tanath	NthDegree	well, it's already mounted...
2006-07-21T09:06:00.000Z	NthDegree	tanath	you using WINE or VMWare?
2006-07-21T09:06:00.000Z	tanath	NthDegree	wine
2006-07-21T09:07:00.000Z	NthDegree	tanath	load winecfg
2006-07-21T09:08:00.000Z	NthDegree	tanath	load winecfg, then add a D drive for your CD-ROM drive
2006-07-21T09:10:00.000Z	tanath	NthDegree	still not working
2006-07-21T09:10:00.000Z	NthDegree	tanath	some games use copy protection that requires exclusive access to the CD drive
2006-07-21T09:11:00.000Z	tanath	NthDegree	why wouldn't it have it?
2006-07-21T09:11:00.000Z	NthDegree	tanath	because WINE is a layer on top of linux not linux itself
2006-07-21T09:12:00.000Z	tanath	NthDegree	i tried mounting manually... still no
2006-07-21T09:12:00.000Z	tanath	NthDegree	so what should i do?
2006-07-21T09:14:00.000Z	tanath	NthDegree	cedega does some things wine doesn't
2006-07-21T09:20:00.000Z	NthDegree	tanath	there are many *LINUX* games
2006-07-21T09:20:00.000Z	tanath	NthDegree	yeh, i have a bunch, but most ppl want to play other games that work in windows...
2006-07-21T09:21:00.000Z	tanath	NthDegree	so i'd still like to know how to get 'em working
2006-07-21T09:23:00.000Z	NthDegree	tanath	it uses proprietary copy protection software
