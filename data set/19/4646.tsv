2008-11-29T00:21:00.000Z	newbnewb		Somehow there is a file in my home trashbin owned by root.  (used sudo instead of gksudo for gui) Anyway, does anyone know the absolute path to the trashbin so that I may go there and reowner the file?
2008-11-29T00:21:00.000Z	rww	newbnewb	/home/USERNAME/.local/share/Trash
2008-11-29T00:24:00.000Z	rww	newbnewb	sudo rm -r DIRNAME
2008-11-29T00:24:00.000Z	rww	newbnewb	(you only need sudo because there's a non-you-owned file in there; normally, you wouldn't put it there)
2008-11-29T00:39:00.000Z	rww	newbnewb	Did you get any other errors apart from that?
2008-11-29T00:39:00.000Z	newbnewb	rww	I did not.
2008-11-29T00:39:00.000Z	newbnewb	rww	It looks like a kernal update?
2008-11-29T00:43:00.000Z	newbnewb	rww	I'm a little fearful when it comes to these kernal updates. :)
2008-11-29T00:44:00.000Z	newbnewb	rww	It looks like I do see more errors happened before I posted
2008-11-29T00:47:00.000Z	rww	newbnewb	What's the output when you run "whereis update-grub" in the terminal?
2008-11-29T00:49:00.000Z	newbnewb	rww	http://www.unique511546p.pastebin.com/m389ab20a
2008-11-29T00:50:00.000Z	rww	newbnewb	eep, that's not good. Give me a sec to look something up
2008-11-29T00:53:00.000Z	rww	newbnewb	okays, found it. Are you using a regular PC, or a Mac?
2008-11-29T00:55:00.000Z	rww	newbnewb	actually, nvm, it shouldn't matter. just issue from the terminal: sudo apt-get --reinstall install grub
2008-11-29T01:00:00.000Z	newbnewb	rww	ok reinstalling
2008-11-29T08:27:00.000Z	rww	newbnewb	System -> Preferences -> Appearence ?
2008-11-30T10:57:00.000Z	rww	newbnewb	skill -u username
2008-11-30T10:58:00.000Z	rww	newbnewb	that sends the TERM signal to all of username's processes. If that doesn't work, skill KILL -u username to kill (not graceful)
2008-11-30T10:59:00.000Z	newbnewb	rww	 thank you
