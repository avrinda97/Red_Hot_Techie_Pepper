2005-02-24T07:37:00.000Z	arbeck	bascule	 I need to know if there is a way to fdisk the usb drive
2005-02-24T07:37:00.000Z	bascule	arbeck	cfdisk /dev/sda <-- or b or c or d
2005-02-24T07:38:00.000Z	arbeck	bascule	that gives me a fatal error :)
2005-02-24T07:38:00.000Z	arbeck	bascule	 the funny thing is it works great on OSX and XP
2005-02-24T07:40:00.000Z	arbeck	bascule	 I wonder if I can fix it in OSX or on an XP box
2005-02-24T07:40:00.000Z	arbeck	bascule	 and then try to mount it here
2005-02-24T07:41:00.000Z	bascule	arbeck	I guess I have never used an extrernal drive, just thumbs
2005-02-24T07:41:00.000Z	arbeck	bascule	well, I had an extra 30gb drive sitting around so i spent $15 on a case and made it into an external drive
2005-02-24T07:42:00.000Z	bascule	arbeck	rightly so, I really dunno whats u with it
2005-02-24T07:42:00.000Z	bascule	arbeck	do you have an fstab entry for another usb device in there?
2005-02-24T07:44:00.000Z	arbeck	bascule	i don't have an entry for any USB devices... it mounts my USB camera as a drive just fine without it
