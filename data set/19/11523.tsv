2006-05-18T08:38:00.000Z	Hfuy		To do what to the server I want access to?
2006-05-18T08:38:00.000Z	Hfuy		I need it to talk to a windows network.
2006-05-18T08:38:00.000Z	Hfuy		You know. For file sharing.
2006-05-18T08:39:00.000Z	Hfuy		Nothing to do with SSH or FTP.
2006-05-18T08:40:00.000Z	Hfuy		I can connect to my XP box but not 2K
2006-05-18T08:40:00.000Z	Hfuy		And I can't connect from Windows to Linux at all
2006-05-18T08:40:00.000Z	Hfuy		I have no idea why, I have changed no settings
2006-05-18T08:42:00.000Z	Hfuy		do I just assume ubuntu simply can't talk to older versions of windows
2006-05-18T08:44:00.000Z	Hfuy		That how-to tells me to install Samba.
2006-05-18T08:44:00.000Z	Hfuy		I must already have Samba for it to talk to the XP box.
2006-05-18T08:45:00.000Z	Kr0ntab	Hfuy	you need to make sure yer win2k has file and print sharing installed... along with the NetBios protocol installed.
2006-05-18T08:45:00.000Z	Hfuy	Kr0ntab	The windows network talks amongst itself fine
2006-05-18T08:45:00.000Z	Kr0ntab		and follow instructions from the page dura game you
2006-05-18T08:45:00.000Z	Hfuy		Neither XP nor 2K can talk to Linux. Linux can talk only to XP.
2006-05-18T08:45:00.000Z	Hfuy		That is the situation.
2006-05-18T08:46:00.000Z	Hfuy		In the workgroup, the 2K box does not appear.
2006-05-18T08:48:00.000Z	Hfuy		is there some inherent incompatibility with 2K I need to know about?
2006-05-18T08:50:00.000Z	Kr0ntab		hfuy... to get it going you need to make sure all the correct protocols are installed and configured properly.  that includes tyhe XP/2k and linux hosts...
2006-05-18T08:51:00.000Z	Kr0ntab	Hfuy	there are no compatability issues with win2k
