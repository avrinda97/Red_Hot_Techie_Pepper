2006-12-27T17:12:00.000Z	Madpilot	Yodude	even ^^^
2006-12-27T17:13:00.000Z	Madpilot	Yodude	USB mice should work on the LiveCD - even wireless mice to, IME
2006-12-27T17:15:00.000Z	Madpilot	Yodude	for mice/keyboards/etc, they should just work. Wireless might be tougher.
2006-12-27T17:15:00.000Z	Madpilot	Yodude	the LiveCD does not touch your hard drive or installed OS at all
2006-12-27T17:16:00.000Z	Madpilot	Yodude	just reboot w/ no CD in the drive, Windows will start normally
2006-12-27T17:25:00.000Z	Madpilot	Yodude	if you have a FAT32 partition, then both XP & Ubuntu could read & write files to it, yes
2006-12-27T17:43:00.000Z	Madpilot	Yodude	adaptr - for regular chat, including Windows war stories, please join #ubuntu-offtopic - we try and keep #ubuntu for support questions
2006-12-27T17:46:00.000Z	Madpilot	Yodude	yes
2006-12-27T17:47:00.000Z	Madpilot	Yodude	when you run the LiveCD, there's a big "Install" icon on the desktop
