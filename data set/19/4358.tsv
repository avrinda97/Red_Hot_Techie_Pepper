2011-08-27T01:01:00.000Z	testing123	guntbert	 negative
2011-08-27T01:02:00.000Z	guntbert	testing123	let us have a look

2011-08-27T01:06:00.000Z	guntbert	testing123	looks normal to my eyes, did you try with sudo aptitude safe-upgrade? that often solves those pesky "partial-upgrade" problems
2011-08-27T01:06:00.000Z	testing123	guntbert	 yes
2011-08-27T01:08:00.000Z	guntbert	testing123	then I don't know either - sorry (although I seem to remember some sort of database corruption within the apt-database...)
2011-08-27T01:09:00.000Z	testing123	guntbert	 :) np
2011-08-27T01:09:00.000Z	testing123	guntbert	 ... database curromtpion? hummm it might be (dunno why)
2011-08-27T01:10:00.000Z	guntbert	testing123	such things happen, but I honestly don't know how to deal with such a beast (I don't expect the janitor to help..)
2011-08-27T01:22:00.000Z	guntbert	testing123	as far as I remember there is, but I don't know the procedure
2011-08-27T01:45:00.000Z	guntbert	testing123	and di you try with aptitude too? I now remember once solving a similar problem by using apt-get instead of aptitude (or the other way round)
2011-08-27T01:46:00.000Z	testing123	guntbert	same result
2011-08-27T01:46:00.000Z	guntbert	testing123	sad - I was just fishing for ideas
2011-08-27T01:47:00.000Z	testing123	guntbert	 i still have one :p format
2011-08-27T01:48:00.000Z	guntbert	testing123	?
2011-08-27T01:48:00.000Z	testing123	guntbert	 i cann always format and put ubuntu 11.04 fresh :)
