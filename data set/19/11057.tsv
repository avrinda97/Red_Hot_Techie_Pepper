2006-10-27T10:49:00.000Z	harisund		Helloooo?? ? Where's /etc/inittab in edgy eft?
2006-10-27T10:50:00.000Z	harisund		ripper there is no inittab in there either
2006-10-27T10:50:00.000Z	harisund		ripper there is no output for locate inittab.. this seriously is bad.
2006-10-27T10:50:00.000Z	Adriano	harisund	there's no inittab on edgy
2006-10-27T10:51:00.000Z	harisund	Adriano	I will be most thankful..  ripper .. calming down :)
2006-10-27T10:51:00.000Z	harisund	Adriano	I just want to remove the getty virtual terminals .. I don't want 6 of them running
2006-10-27T10:53:00.000Z	harisund	Adriano	my question is essentially this. A proces listing shows me plenty of crap I dont' need on my system, and I want to know whether Ubuntu allows users to customize it. I want to start by remoivng /sbin/getty . Any ideas?
2006-10-27T10:54:00.000Z	harisund	Adriano	.. ok .. what about removing ssh-agent. Do you know where I can do that?
2006-10-27T10:57:00.000Z	harisund	Adriano	System - Preferences - Sessions doesnt' list ssh-agent. And no, it has nothign to do with a ssh-server being installed. And System->Preferences-Sessions sucks too, since I can't delete any of them, only disable them. If I can't delete them in the first place, why provide a button to delete that is always greyed out?
2006-10-27T10:58:00.000Z	Adriano	harisund	the fourth tab there shows me ssh-agent
2006-10-27T10:59:00.000Z	Adriano	harisund	and I can eliminate it from there (the button is enabled)
2006-10-27T10:59:00.000Z	harisund	Adriano	fourth tab? All I see is 3 tabs (Session Options, Current Session, Startup Programs).
2006-10-27T10:59:00.000Z	Adriano	harisund	third
2006-10-27T10:59:00.000Z	Adriano	harisund	startup programs
2006-10-27T11:00:00.000Z	harisund	Adriano	my startup programs has "update-notifier" '/usr/lib/evolution/2.8/evolution-alarm-notify" gnome-power-manager gnome-volume-manager --sm-disable.
2006-10-27T11:01:00.000Z	Adriano	harisund	I'd say, remove ssh-agent and reinstall, or try and upgrade things
2006-10-27T11:02:00.000Z	Adriano	harisund	I got fresh gaim beta4 this morning
2006-10-27T11:05:00.000Z	harisund	Adriano	ok one last annoyance. Do you know how to turn off the fading of the screen when I want to shutdown/log out etc?
2006-10-27T11:05:00.000Z	Adriano	harisund	no clue
