2006-12-16T15:27:00.000Z	iturk	Administrator	you mean search for webdevelopment
2006-12-16T15:28:00.000Z	Administrator	iturk	search for editor and grep for tags like HTML
2006-12-16T15:29:00.000Z	iturk	Administrator	apt-cache search editor | grep html -> proofgeneral-doc !! just this !!
2006-12-16T15:29:00.000Z	Administrator	iturk	try capital letters for html
2006-12-16T15:30:00.000Z	Administrator	iturk	bluefish is in universe do you have the right repository's in your sources.list?

2006-12-16T15:30:00.000Z	iturk	Administrator	yes i can search for it
2006-12-16T15:31:00.000Z	Administrator	iturk	well there is no console stuff in there.
2006-12-16T15:31:00.000Z	Administrator	iturk	only gui.
2006-12-16T15:32:00.000Z	iturk	Administrator	i already try quanta for it but i think that visual studio its much powerfull !! i would like to find something similar
2006-12-16T15:32:00.000Z	Administrator	iturk	take a while, experiment with edtiors, try vim and emacs, these are the two most used and advanced editors out there. ( #emacs , #vim )
2006-12-16T15:32:00.000Z	iturk	Administrator	i understand
2006-12-16T15:34:00.000Z	iturk	Administrator	i will check bluefish
2006-12-16T15:35:00.000Z	Administrator	iturk	my personal favor: emacs.
2006-12-16T15:35:00.000Z	iturk	Administrator	i understand your point but if the ide its more user friendly then you can program more efficiently and more fast
2006-12-16T15:36:00.000Z	Administrator	iturk	emacs works keyboard binding.
2006-12-16T15:36:00.000Z	iturk	Administrator	i usually use vim but only for c programming
