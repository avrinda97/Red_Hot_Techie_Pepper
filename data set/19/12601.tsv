2005-08-06T08:33:00.000Z	Ohpoo	La_PaRCa	hmmm how did you install the flash plugin?
2005-08-06T08:33:00.000Z	La_PaRCa		apt-get flash-nonfree
2005-08-06T08:34:00.000Z	Ohpoo	La_PaRCa	hmm let me see something one second
2005-08-06T08:35:00.000Z	Ohpoo	La_PaRCa	hmm I didn't install that version . I'll tell you what I did
2005-08-06T08:37:00.000Z	Ohpoo	La_PaRCa	I did this and it works fine #sudo apt-get install flashplayer-mozilla
2005-08-06T08:37:00.000Z	La_PaRCa	Ohpoo	trying that one as we speak
2005-08-06T08:37:00.000Z	Ohpoo	La_PaRCa	sweet

2005-08-06T08:39:00.000Z	La_PaRCa	Ohpoo	might be something wrong with firefox, cuz mozilla is being cool about it
2005-08-06T08:39:00.000Z	Ohpoo	La_PaRCa	yea firefox can be alittle crazy sometimes
2005-08-06T08:39:00.000Z	La_PaRCa	Ohpoo	Ill have to see about it
2005-08-06T08:41:00.000Z	Ohpoo	La_PaRCa	I find that mozilla is more stable then firefox.
2005-08-06T08:42:00.000Z	La_PaRCa	Ohpoo	probably, but its a bunch heavier
