2006-12-08T10:37:00.000Z	Thialfihar		Anyone know a method to measure CPU speed on Linux?
2006-12-08T10:39:00.000Z	zigford	Thialfihar	Do you mean check what cpu speed your running at? ("cat /proc/cpuinfo")
2006-12-08T10:42:00.000Z	zigford	Thialfihar	That command will tell you what it is running at.  If its overclocked it will show it.
2006-12-08T10:45:00.000Z	zigford	Thialfihar	the cpuinfo is continually being updated, don't think of it as a file, but as a query to your cpu
2006-12-08T10:45:00.000Z	zigford	Thialfihar	if you just run something cpu intensive, you can see it going up and down
2006-12-08T10:49:00.000Z	zigford	Thialfihar	lemme check mine
2006-12-08T10:51:00.000Z	zigford	Thialfihar	it is updating dynamic on mine
2006-12-08T10:54:00.000Z	zigford	Thialfihar	works out of the box for me
2006-12-08T10:55:00.000Z	zigford	Thialfihar	dynamic cpu has to be supported by you computer tho
2006-12-08T10:55:00.000Z	zigford	Thialfihar	what is your comp?
2006-12-08T10:57:00.000Z	zigford	Thialfihar	Maybe it only does dynamic frequency scaling on laptops??
2006-12-08T10:57:00.000Z	zigford	Thialfihar	what did you overclock to?
2006-12-08T10:59:00.000Z	zigford	Thialfihar	hmm, I see,  Well, cpuinfo doesn't lie.  For example on my lappy, when I;m just chatting away here, cpuinfo says 800mhz
2006-12-08T11:00:00.000Z	zigford	Thialfihar	when I start zipping a file or somthing, it jumps up to 1.8ghz
2006-12-08T11:01:00.000Z	zigford	Thialfihar	/proc is a dynamic filesystem the represents current hardware/software/kernel settings, so cpuinfo gets updated because /proc is part of the kernel
2006-12-08T11:02:00.000Z	zigford	Thialfihar	its like asking the kernel what its doing now, but its represented in a filesystem
2006-12-08T11:03:00.000Z	zigford	Thialfihar	thats just the scaling factors that my cpu supports.
2006-12-08T11:06:00.000Z	zigford	Thialfihar	you can still see the current bogomips in /proc/cpuinfo |grep bogomips
2006-12-08T11:07:00.000Z	zigford	Thialfihar	your right
