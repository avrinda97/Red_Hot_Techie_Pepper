2010-07-13T00:07:00.000Z	andeeeuk		i come on here every soo often and there is never really great support
2010-07-13T00:07:00.000Z	andeeeuk		thanks for your help though
2010-07-13T00:08:00.000Z	andeeeuk		though i am reasonable technical minded and know what i am doing sometimes small buggy updates are an issue
2010-07-13T00:08:00.000Z	andeeeuk		and always seems to skrew up the system
2010-07-13T00:09:00.000Z	andeeeuk		for a basic question it is good to get a reasonable simple answer
2010-07-13T00:11:00.000Z	andeeeuk		==================================================

2010-07-13T00:11:00.000Z	andeeeuk		Detected configuration:
2010-07-13T00:11:00.000Z	andeeeuk		Architecture: x86_64 (64-bit)
2010-07-13T00:12:00.000Z	thune3	andeeeuk	are you running drivers from the repos, kernel from the repos? Have you tried just reinstalling graphics drivers? Or considered just staying on older kernel (kernel updates within an Ubuntu release are by definition minor.)
2010-07-13T00:13:00.000Z	andeeeuk	thune3	i downloaded the drivers and installed the manually
2010-07-13T00:13:00.000Z	andeeeuk		just dont seem to be working at all now
2010-07-13T00:14:00.000Z	thune3	andeeeuk	then you would certianly need to re-install them for a new kernel version, and every kernel update. This is why drivers from repos are superior.
2010-07-13T00:15:00.000Z	andeeeuk	thune3	can i completely remove them and install the repo ones and if so, how can i do that?
2010-07-13T00:15:00.000Z	andeeeuk		is there a basic tutorial somewhere
2010-07-13T00:15:00.000Z	andeeeuk		need to wipe the old drivers id imagine
2010-07-13T00:16:00.000Z	thune3	andeeeuk	i'm not sure for ATI. it may be possible to just install the drivers from the repos and be OK.
2010-07-13T00:17:00.000Z	andeeeuk	thune3	i have tried many things but nothing working
