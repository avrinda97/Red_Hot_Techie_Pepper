2008-08-04T01:34:00.000Z	NeroGage		Hey, I've just installed Ubuntu as a dual with Window XP (Pre installed) and I have a problem with the start screen for selecting which OS to boot in. My keyboard seems to not work, but as soon as ubuntu loads it works. It's wireless and a Belkin one, any ideas?
2008-08-04T01:35:00.000Z	Eyes`Only	NeroGage	enable legacy usb in your BIOS
2008-08-04T01:35:00.000Z	Eyes`Only	NeroGage	umm well what type of PC do you have?
2008-08-04T01:36:00.000Z	Eyes`Only	NeroGage	reboot and when you see the splash screen hit Delete I think
2008-08-04T01:37:00.000Z	Eyes`Only	NeroGage	It should say at the bottom of your screen right when your monitor comes on which key to press to enter setup
2008-08-04T01:37:00.000Z	NeroGage	Eyes`Only	 Yeah, I can enter the BIOS, but is activating the Legacy USB easy to find? If so I'll jsut hunt around a bit.
2008-08-04T01:38:00.000Z	NeroGage	Eyes`Only	Okay, thanks.
2008-08-04T01:38:00.000Z	Eyes`Only	NeroGage	np. I had the same problem :P
2008-08-04T01:53:00.000Z	NeroGage	Eyes`Only	Thanks, it worked. Is it possible to change the order of the list in the "Select your OS", I'd prefer Windows XP to be at the top.
2008-08-04T01:54:00.000Z	Eyes`Only	NeroGage	yes, edit /boot/grub/menu.lst
2008-08-04T01:54:00.000Z	Eyes`Only	NeroGage	you can rearrange the menu, or just set 'default' to be the XP selection
2008-08-04T02:01:00.000Z	NeroGage	Eyes`Only	I'm in /boot/grub/, which file do I have to edit now?
2008-08-04T02:03:00.000Z	Eyes`Only	NeroGage	menu.lst
2008-08-04T02:06:00.000Z	NeroGage	Eyes`Only	Do I just move this "title: Windows.. blah blah, root, etc" up in the list of the other ones? is it safe to remove the divider?
2008-08-04T02:06:00.000Z	Eyes`Only	NeroGage	move the whole block, yes
2008-08-04T02:06:00.000Z	Eyes`Only	NeroGage	or just change the default to be the 2nd/3rd/whatever
2008-08-04T02:10:00.000Z	Eyes`Only	NeroGage	type 'gksu /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2008-08-04T02:14:00.000Z	NeroGage	Eyes`Only	I've entered that command, but it doesn't seemed to have had any effect.
2008-08-04T02:16:00.000Z	NeroGage	Eyes`Only	Okay it's let me save it. I'll test it now. Thankyou.
