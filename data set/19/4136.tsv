2009-11-12T02:59:00.000Z	Scunizi	Splendid	so am I running irssi
2009-11-12T03:00:00.000Z	Scunizi	Splendid	sounds like you have several screens loaded.. to reattach to one screen -r <first number listed>
2009-11-12T03:01:00.000Z	Splendid	Scunizi	ok then how to I kill that one :D
2009-11-12T03:01:00.000Z	Scunizi	Splendid	then when you're inside that screen session ctrl+a k or "exit
2009-11-12T03:01:00.000Z	Splendid	Scunizi	nope
2009-11-12T03:01:00.000Z	Splendid	Scunizi	and I need to kill it
2009-11-12T03:02:00.000Z	Scunizi	Splendid	ok.. hang on .. looking
2009-11-12T03:02:00.000Z	Scunizi	Splendid	screen -X -S {session # you want to kill} kil
2009-11-12T03:03:00.000Z	Scunizi	Splendid	the last "l" on kill didn't make the paste
2009-11-12T03:03:00.000Z	Splendid	Scunizi	probably that is the solution will try it now
2009-11-12T03:04:00.000Z	Splendid	Scunizi	thanks thats it
2009-11-12T03:04:00.000Z	Scunizi	Splendid	you can also start screen with more useful names .. like this.. screen -S irssi .. will create a screen session named irssi
2009-11-12T03:04:00.000Z	Splendid	Scunizi	tnx, but I don't need that future :D
2009-11-12T03:05:00.000Z	Scunizi	Splendid	how about splitting the terminal session running in screen so you have 2 halves? upper and lower?
2009-11-12T03:05:00.000Z	Splendid	Scunizi	sounds interesting, but still I don't need it very much :D
2009-11-12T03:06:00.000Z	Scunizi	Splendid	no problem.. there's lots of good tutorials out there.. I run irssi in screen and occationally split the terminal so I can look something up in one half while still following irc inthe other.
