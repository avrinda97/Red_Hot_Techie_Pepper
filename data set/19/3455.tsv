2009-08-05T04:07:00.000Z	dumont		HELP PLEASE! why can't I install vnstat? http://pastebin.com/m474431cb
2009-08-05T04:08:00.000Z	lstarnes	dumont	you have no /proc/acpi/event
2009-08-05T04:08:00.000Z	lstarnes	dumont	make sure you don't have acpi disabled
2009-08-05T04:08:00.000Z	dumont	lstarnes	how do I do that?
2009-08-05T04:08:00.000Z	lstarnes	dumont	I don't remember
2009-08-05T04:10:00.000Z	lstarnes	dumont	it may be disabled if "noacpi" appears in /proc/cmdline
2009-08-05T04:12:00.000Z	dumont	lstarnes	the only thing in that file is "auto BOOT_IMAGE=linux ro root=801
2009-08-05T04:13:00.000Z	dumont	lstarnes	the only thing in that file is "auto BOOT_IMAGE=linux ro root=801"
2009-08-05T04:14:00.000Z	lstarnes	dumont	what do you have in /etc/acpi?
2009-08-05T04:14:00.000Z	lstarnes	dumont	oops, /proc/acpi
2009-08-05T22:48:00.000Z	lstarnes	dumont	do you just need something that monitors bandwidth usage, or do you need something with more functionality?
2009-08-05T22:50:00.000Z	dumont	lstarnes	I need something that sits on my desktop, not too big of a graph and displays BW usage, total, today, upload, download, not too big, not too much functionality
2009-08-05T23:01:00.000Z	lstarnes	dumont	I can't think of anything that does exactly what you are asking for, but there is an applet for network monitoring
2009-08-05T23:02:00.000Z	lstarnes	dumont	if you're using gnome, right-click on the panel, select "add to panel", and look for "network monitor"
2009-08-05T23:03:00.000Z	lstarnes	dumont	which version of kde?
2009-08-05T23:04:00.000Z	lstarnes	dumont	you could probably try conky.  If it's KDE 4, there may be a plasma applet for network monitoring
2009-08-05T23:55:00.000Z	lstarnes	dumont	it's several files
2009-08-05T23:55:00.000Z	lstarnes	dumont	/etc/rc.local is one of them
2009-08-05T23:56:00.000Z	dumont	lstarnes	I have vncserver, I'd like for it to start running upon restart, under a normal user, not under root
