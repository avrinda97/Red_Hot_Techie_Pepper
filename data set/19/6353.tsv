2008-03-21T03:02:00.000Z	xomp		I've spent all day trying to get this wireless working, could someone please help me? My wireless (wlan0) shows up, but when I enter in my SSID it just stays at "Attempting to connect to wireless" then fails out after a couple minutes with no error message.
2008-03-21T03:03:00.000Z	xomp		lol danand_ you're still here too?
2008-03-21T03:04:00.000Z	danand_	xomp	- yeah ... i come and go :)
2008-03-21T03:05:00.000Z	xomp	danand_	I know what you mean, after asking for like 2 solid hours straight with either no response, or someone getting you started on something then leave you have to take a break.
2008-03-21T03:06:00.000Z	danand_	xomp	- i spent about a week getting wireless working with my debian laptop ... i know how you feel. Have you tried working through the stuff on that web page to set up your wireless?
2008-03-21T03:07:00.000Z	xomp	danand_	I've spent the past hour looking at the wifidocs, it appears that all is well with the setup. Just don't know why it won't work :(
2008-03-21T03:09:00.000Z	danand_	xomp	- how is your card working? ndiswrapper, kernel module?
2008-03-21T03:10:00.000Z	xomp	danand_	kernel module I believe
2008-03-21T03:10:00.000Z	danand_	xomp	- what card do you have?
2008-03-21T03:10:00.000Z	xomp	danand_	I did an lsmod for prism2_usb and it's all there, even shows up in network tools.
2008-03-21T03:10:00.000Z	danand_	xomp	- k
2008-03-21T03:10:00.000Z	xomp	danand_	I just installed the linux-wlan-ng package, going to reboot and see if it fixes it hehe
2008-03-21T03:11:00.000Z	danand_	xomp	- cool, luck :)
2008-03-21T03:15:00.000Z	xomp	danand_	no love with the linux-wlan-ng package lol
2008-03-21T03:16:00.000Z	danand_	xomp	- bah :(
2008-03-21T03:17:00.000Z	danand_	xomp	- alternative - buy a plug in card thats supported :)
2008-03-21T03:18:00.000Z	xomp	danand_	I could do that, but I was laid off work recently so I have no monies lol
2008-03-21T03:19:00.000Z	danand_	xomp	- i just got made redundant too ... :( ... lousy job anyway :)
2008-03-21T03:19:00.000Z	danand_	xomp	- two cookies ... not bad :)
