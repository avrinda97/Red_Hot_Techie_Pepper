2005-04-20T16:49:00.000Z	Arnia	Hackmo	If its writable and hasn't been finalised then it will bring up nautilus-burn I believe
2005-04-20T16:50:00.000Z	Hackmo	Arnia	I was thinking that but I didn't burn the disk so I don't know if it has been finalised, is there anyway to view the contents of the disk though?
2005-04-20T16:50:00.000Z	Arnia	Hackmo	/media/cdrom should have it
2005-04-20T16:51:00.000Z	Hackmo	Arnia	I tried /media/cdrom but it doesn't display any files, although there is a stop sign like image in the information bar, does that mean I need to be root?
2005-04-20T16:53:00.000Z	Arnia	Hackmo	Right look in cdrom0
2005-04-20T16:54:00.000Z	Hackmo	Arnia	i've already tried that there is nothing in that folder either
2005-04-20T16:54:00.000Z	Arnia	Hackmo	You sure the DVD works? Tried on other systems? (sorry to ask, but always eliminate the obvious first :)
2005-04-20T16:55:00.000Z	Hackmo	Arnia	yeah i'm sure the DVD works, it works on all of my other computers (ask any questions you like I appriciate the help :P )
2005-04-20T16:58:00.000Z	Arnia	Hackmo	I'm not quite sure how to fix this. Does it mount other CDs/DVDs ok?
2005-04-20T16:59:00.000Z	Hackmo	Arnia	This has happened before, sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't
2005-04-20T16:59:00.000Z	Hackmo	Arnia	other cd/dvd's are ok though yeah
2005-04-20T05:00:00.000Z	Arnia	Hackmo	Try posting to project-utopia's mailing lists cos it sounds like HAL being confused
2005-04-20T05:00:00.000Z	Arnia	Hackmo	what do you mean by information bit?
2005-04-20T05:01:00.000Z	Hackmo	Arnia	ok will do, to the left of the nautilus window just under where it says "address" in the address bar there is a grey rectangle that says information
2005-04-20T05:02:00.000Z	Arnia	Hackmo	You're using browser mode?
2005-04-20T05:02:00.000Z	Hackmo	Arnia	I'm not completely sure what you mean by browser mode?
2005-04-20T05:03:00.000Z	Arnia	Hackmo	One window... no memory of where on the desktop it is put
2005-04-20T05:03:00.000Z	Hackmo	Arnia	yeah, just one window
2005-04-20T05:04:00.000Z	Arnia	Hackmo	I shed browser mode a long time ago so I've forgotten its affordances
