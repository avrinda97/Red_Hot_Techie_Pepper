2011-05-05T12:49:00.000Z	Pritesh		i have upgraded from ubuntu 10.10 to 11.04 now it doesn't load and stuck on ubuntu screen
2011-05-05T12:49:00.000Z	Pritesh		anybody seen that problem ??
2011-05-05T12:50:00.000Z	k|oWn	Pritesh	i just had that problem
2011-05-05T12:50:00.000Z	k|oWn		for me i figured out so far that it was actually loading
2011-05-05T12:50:00.000Z	k|oWn		it took 15 minutes
2011-05-05T12:50:00.000Z	k|oWn		someone here suggested it might be something i have connected to my USB that makes 11.04 load slow
2011-05-05T12:50:00.000Z	Pritesh	k|oWn	its not loading at all for me
2011-05-05T12:50:00.000Z	k|oWn		yeah mine seemed like it wasnt loading at all either
2011-05-05T12:51:00.000Z	Pritesh		how did you fix it ?
2011-05-05T12:51:00.000Z	k|oWn		i did turn off quiet-splash and that made it so i could watch it load slowly
2011-05-05T12:52:00.000Z	k|oWn		its still loaded, i havnt tried it again with the USB thing unplugged
2011-05-05T12:52:00.000Z	k|oWn		but my system would make it to the ubuntu logo splash screen thing with the five scrolling dots
2011-05-05T12:52:00.000Z	Pritesh		i don't have usb connected
2011-05-05T12:53:00.000Z	k|oWn		pritesh: are you stuck at the ubuntu logo with the scrolling dots like i was ?
2011-05-05T12:54:00.000Z	Pritesh		yes thats where it is getting stuck
2011-05-05T12:55:00.000Z	k|oWn		"sudo rm -fR ./*" would wipe the whole system, or would it wind up wiping itself and having half a system left, or where does it begin removing files? alphabetically ?
2011-05-05T12:58:00.000Z	k|oWn	Pritesh	try "alt-ctrl-F1" and see if there are any errors? then altctrlF7 brings you back, but at that screen with the scrolling dots, right before it , i pressed escape and removed -quiet-splash form the kernal options and it let me watch what was going on instead of staring at a bunch of neverending scrolling dots
2011-05-05T12:59:00.000Z	k|oWn		from that i learned in not stuck or locked just its taking about fifteen minutes to load instead of the one minute that 10.10 took
2011-05-05T13:01:00.000Z	Pritesh	k|oWn	it simply hangs and can't do anything from that point
