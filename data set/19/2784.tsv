2010-03-15T09:58:00.000Z	pwnkiller		just make?
2010-03-15T09:58:00.000Z	pwnkiller		i get an error msg
2010-03-15T09:58:00.000Z	Losha	pwnkiller	the *exact* text of the error msg?
2010-03-15T10:00:00.000Z	Losha	pwnkiller	unlikely, since it didn't produce a makefile. Run configure again and paste the output to http://ubuntu.pastebin.com
2010-03-15T10:01:00.000Z	Losha	pwnkiller	I can't tell from just those lines if those are fatal errors, or just advisory warnings, but since you didn't get a makefile, I assume the former....
2010-03-15T10:02:00.000Z	Losha	pwnkiller	are you trying to build mozilla?
2010-03-15T10:03:00.000Z	Losha	pwnkiller	fine, I'll just sit here and try and guess which program you're trying to build....
2010-03-15T10:08:00.000Z	Losha	pwnkiller	see this line "error: Package requirements (libxul-unstable mozilla-plugin) were not met" -- that's a fatal error, which is why you didn't get a makefile. You need to fix that before you can proceed...
2010-03-15T10:11:00.000Z	Losha	pwnkiller	since you won't even tell me what program you're trying to build, how am I supposed to help...
2010-03-15T10:14:00.000Z	Losha	pwnkiller	type apt-cache search libxul and see if something suitable shows up. Same for mozilla-plugin (except there are so many plugins for mozilla, I don't know which it wants. Maybe there's something in the documentation?)
2010-03-15T10:18:00.000Z	Losha	pwnkiller	I s'pose so. No guarantee I'll be able to make sense of it though. Isn't there a repo version of moonshine you can install? So much less work if you can...
2010-03-15T10:23:00.000Z	Losha	pwnkiller	patience. The readme doesn't tell me much. I'm reading web pages looking for a way to install moonshine
2010-03-15T10:25:00.000Z	Losha	pwnkiller	Zenker: is this it? http://abock.org/moonshine/
2010-03-15T10:26:00.000Z	Losha	pwnkiller	where did you get the source code from?
2010-03-15T10:26:00.000Z	Losha	pwnkiller	Zenker: so can you install it from that site?
2010-03-15T10:28:00.000Z	Losha	pwnkiller	Zenker: ok, I've downloaded it and got as far as you did. Let me read some docs...
2010-03-15T10:33:00.000Z	Losha	pwnkiller	Zenker: hmm, doesn't look good. Looks like a bug: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xulrunner-1.9/+bug/273956
