2010-01-23T10:58:00.000Z	d4n1		 fork, system, execl, getpid, getppid, wait, waitpid,  perror and exit. <-- i need their man entries, how can i get them?
2010-01-23T10:59:00.000Z	Blue1	d4n1	those are system processes
2010-01-23T10:59:00.000Z	Blue1	d4n1	except for excel
2010-01-23T11:00:00.000Z	Blue1	d4n1	maybe you're using a different version of ubuntu - but mine does NOT have those
2010-01-23T11:01:00.000Z	d4n1	Blue1	exaclty, mine doesnt either
2010-01-23T11:01:00.000Z	Blue1	d4n1	and I wouldn't expect they would those are kernel specific
2010-01-23T11:02:00.000Z	d4n1	Blue1	apparently, try it, sudo apt-get install manpages-dev, they are there
2010-01-23T11:02:00.000Z	Blue1	d4n1	that make sense....
2010-01-23T11:05:00.000Z	Blue1	d4n1	I don't do kernel development - sorry I can't help -- now mvs - that's a different story - that and RSX I do know the internals
2010-01-23T11:06:00.000Z	Blue1	d4n1	fork was born in RSX land
2010-01-23T11:07:00.000Z	d4n1	Blue1	what does that mean?
2010-01-23T11:07:00.000Z	Blue1	d4n1	to fork a process is to send it from kernel process status, to a non-priveleged state to continue processing
2010-01-23T11:08:00.000Z	Blue1	d4n1	i.e. nmi vs mi (non-maskable interrupts vs maskable interrupts)
2010-01-23T11:09:00.000Z	d4n1	Blue1	im lost, im kind of a beginer :(, but you know your stuff
2010-01-23T11:10:00.000Z	Blue1	d4n1	yes, but you don't need to know how a car engine works, to drive a car - neither do you need to know the internals of linux to use it.
2010-01-23T11:12:00.000Z	d4n1	Blue1	you are absolutely right. But you need to learn to drive it before you hop in the drives seat
2010-01-23T11:12:00.000Z	d4n1	Blue1	im still at learning
2010-01-23T11:15:00.000Z	Blue1	d4n1	or free donuts!
2010-01-23T11:15:00.000Z	d4n1	Blue1	u just made me hungry
