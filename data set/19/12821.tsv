2005-07-01T14:57:00.000Z	Shepherd		hello all.
2005-07-01T14:58:00.000Z	Shepherd		I'm having difficulty getting sounds working with another user on this system. Dag meneer hondje!
2005-07-01T14:59:00.000Z	Shepherd		I've made sure that ESD is running, that all users are in the sound group, and checked the following link:
2005-07-01T15:00:00.000Z	Shepherd		hmm. can't find it but it's a forum about sound written by a french person.
2005-07-01T15:00:00.000Z	Seveas	Shepherd	are you trying to let 2 users use the sound server simultaneously?
2005-07-01T15:01:00.000Z	Shepherd	Seveas	okay. I think I looked at that one the other day but I'll make sure right quick.
2005-07-01T15:12:00.000Z	Shepherd	Seveas	do you know where to find the totem configuration file?
2005-07-01T15:13:00.000Z	Shepherd	Seveas	do you know where to find the totem configuration file?
2005-07-01T15:24:00.000Z	Seveas	Shepherd	type 'cat /etc/issue' in a shell to be sure :)

2005-07-01T15:37:00.000Z	Seveas	Shepherd	One-line upgrade: sudo sed -e 's/warty/hoary/' -i /etc/apt/sources.list && sudo aptitude update && sudo aptitude dist-upgrade

2005-07-01T15:38:00.000Z	Seveas	Shepherd	be warned, it will have to download at least 450 MB and need a while to upgrade...
2005-07-01T15:38:00.000Z	Shepherd	Seveas	if I had to install sound modules and such will they be uninstalled when I reboot? OR is there no way of knowing?
2005-07-01T15:39:00.000Z	Seveas	Shepherd	depends on what you mean with install
2005-07-01T15:40:00.000Z	Seveas	Shepherd	probably in /etc/modules
