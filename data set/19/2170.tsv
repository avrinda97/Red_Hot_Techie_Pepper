2010-08-28T07:08:00.000Z	csmith1994		how do i set it up
2010-08-28T07:08:00.000Z	Sc00t3r	csmith1994	You can't.
2010-08-28T07:09:00.000Z	csmith1994	Sc00t3r	are you kidding?
2010-08-28T07:09:00.000Z	Sc00t3r		ssmith1994: Check on Google. If you really think Ubuntu supports a tablet along with the hardware on an iPad, you're nuts.
2010-08-28T07:10:00.000Z	csmith1994	Sc00t3r	it supports the ipad i just have to set it up on a different system
2010-08-28T07:10:00.000Z	csmith1994		yeah thats what i mean
2010-08-28T07:10:00.000Z	Sc00t3r		csmith: One, an iPad doesn't have CD/DVD/USB functionality. 2, you can't take the hard drive out of it without tearing the whole thing apart, and even then, I'm not sure how you would install it to that hard drive.
2010-08-28T07:10:00.000Z	csmith1994		sc00t3r im not trying to put itunes on it
2010-08-28T07:10:00.000Z	Sc00t3r	csmith1994	OH. I am so sorry. I thought you meant install ubuntu to iPad.
2010-08-28T07:11:00.000Z	csmith1994		linux*
2010-08-28T07:11:00.000Z	csmith1994		nah
2010-08-28T07:11:00.000Z	csmith1994		i just bought an ipad
2010-08-28T07:11:00.000Z	Sc00t3r	csmith1994	You have to sync all 'i' devices with Windows to have them prepared, then use them (usually) with Rhythmbox. That's the only option I know of.
2010-08-28T07:11:00.000Z	csmith1994		it doesnt turn on until you plug it in to itunes, i needd to know how to do that on a ubuntu computer
2010-08-28T07:12:00.000Z	csmith1994		are you serious i dont have a windows computer at my disposal
2010-08-28T07:12:00.000Z	csmith1994		so i'm stuck with this. i used to like linux but lately it's been workaround this workaround that.
2010-08-28T07:12:00.000Z	Sc00t3r	csmith1994	I am very serious. I don't think you can do it straight from Linux unless you install iTunes on Linux.
