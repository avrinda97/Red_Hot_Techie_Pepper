2008-11-12T01:54:00.000Z	natbet	Hideme	ethX isn't kept in /dev, what are you trying to do?
2008-11-12T01:56:00.000Z	natbet	Hideme	what is in /etc/network/interfaces ?
2008-11-12T01:58:00.000Z	Hideme	natbet	  just the loopback.    If I run an ifconfig I see all interfaces I should have (eth0, 1 and 2.
2008-11-12T01:59:00.000Z	natbet	Hideme	are you using network manager to manage your network interfaces? and what are your interfaces?
2008-11-12T01:59:00.000Z	Hideme	natbet	 Apparently 8.10 doesn't like when you manually edit the network config. Found that out the hard way and started using the network manager GUI.
2008-11-12T01:59:00.000Z	Hideme	natbet	 yes.  Eth0, eth1 and eth2.
2008-11-12T02:00:00.000Z	natbet	Hideme	no, the network manager is just finiky, I usually uninstall it right off the bat :)
2008-11-12T02:00:00.000Z	natbet	Hideme	all three are ethernet connections?
2008-11-12T02:00:00.000Z	Hideme	natbet	 But as I said... soon as I reboot, I get a second eth2 under the network manager.
2008-11-12T02:00:00.000Z	Hideme	natbet	 Yes
2008-11-12T02:04:00.000Z	natbet	Hideme	does ifconfig show the extra eth2?
2008-11-12T02:05:00.000Z	Hideme	natbet	 At the moment, no. Because I usually delete the second eth2 on start-up since I need eth0 as primary.
2008-11-12T02:06:00.000Z	natbet	Hideme	just to make sure I'm understanding right, the computer has 3 network interfaces, on boot you get eth0, eth1, eth2, eth2?
2008-11-12T02:08:00.000Z	Hideme	natbet	  Two physical ethernet cards.  One of which is a dual interface, all in all 3 ethernet ports eth0, eth1 and eth2.
2008-11-12T02:08:00.000Z	Hideme	natbet	and yes...  eth0, eth1, eth2, eth2 show in the network manager GUI
2008-11-12T02:09:00.000Z	natbet	Hideme	how are you deleting the extra eth2?
2008-11-12T02:09:00.000Z	Hideme	natbet	though I haven't looked to see what MAC address the 2nd eth2 gets... or ifconfig when its happening.  Just usually rm the interface.
2008-11-12T02:09:00.000Z	Hideme	natbet	with the network GUI
2008-11-12T02:14:00.000Z	Hideme	natbet	 brb.. going to reboot and check the MAC
