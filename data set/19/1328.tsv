2011-02-26T08:56:00.000Z	magpii		hi, I have a slight problem, when i click on any folder in the places section in the taskbar, it always takes me to appearance prefferences, anyone else had this problem with 10.10 maverick? if so, how do i resolve it?
2011-02-26T08:57:00.000Z	magpii		i am only a wek old with ubuntu myself and still ironing out some slight issues
2011-02-26T08:58:00.000Z	dr_Willis_	magpii	ive seen that happen if the 'default app' thats used for folders get set to somthing other then the proper "open folder" program.   I think i fixed it once using ubuntu-tweak. but there maybe othe rways to fix it.
2011-02-26T08:59:00.000Z	magpii		where do i fnd the default app selection again?
2011-02-26T09:00:00.000Z	dr_Willis_		i always just use the 'not in the repos' tool 'ubuntu-tweak' to handle that magpii.
2011-02-26T09:00:00.000Z	magpii		is ubuntu tweak in the repository?
2011-02-26T09:01:00.000Z	magpii		i tried the right clicking, but all it does is open the folder thats selected, its not opening the appearance preferences in the programs, but actually every folder in places seems to open app preferences
2011-02-26T09:03:00.000Z	magpii		where do i find ubuntu tweak?
2011-02-26T09:03:00.000Z	magpii		thanks

2011-02-26T10:02:00.000Z	dr_Willis_		Right clicking on a folder in places? Hmm. You mean the sidebar? or the menu item?
2011-02-26T10:03:00.000Z	dr_Willis_		im not in gnome - so cant recreate what hes doing.
2011-02-26T10:04:00.000Z	dr_Willis_		if you were to doiuble click on a folder. or select a folder in the places menu item. and it opens the wrong item. that would be a sign your default application for 'folders' is incorrect.
2011-02-26T10:06:00.000Z	dr_Willis_	magpii	ubuntu-tweak has a 'file assoications'  feature - see what the 'folder'  entry is set to open with by default. It also has a 'reset gnome back to defaults' feature. Im not on a linux box right now so cant suggest anything in more details.
