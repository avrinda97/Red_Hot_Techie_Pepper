2010-04-25T09:05:00.000Z	xangua	^paradox^	maybe adding the vlc PPA if you don't want to wait
2010-04-25T09:05:00.000Z	xangua	^paradox^	but don't know if it's aviable for hardy
2010-07-01T02:06:00.000Z	xangua	^paradox^	how did you update fx¿¿ why not use lucid lynx¿¿
2010-07-01T02:06:00.000Z	^paradox^	xangua	i got the updates thru update manager. they were just there for me today
2010-07-01T02:07:00.000Z	^paradox^	xangua	im not sure
2010-07-01T02:11:00.000Z	^paradox^	xangua	what it does on opening is come up and disappear. its like when u close a window
2010-07-01T02:12:00.000Z	xangua	^paradox^	was xulrunner updated¿¿ check in synaptic hystory
2010-07-01T02:18:00.000Z	^paradox^	xangua	i didnt see anything about xulrunner
2010-07-01T02:19:00.000Z	^paradox^	xangua	ok ill brb
2010-07-01T02:23:00.000Z	^paradox^	xangua	it looks as if it installed more firefox updates and more gnome updates, but i still dont see xulrunner in history
2010-07-01T02:25:00.000Z	^paradox^	xangua	and its still doing the same thing when it opens except now theres a black box instead of firefox icon on my upper panel
2010-07-01T02:28:00.000Z	^paradox^	xangua	i cant pastebin u the history cause firefox isnt working
