2010-06-16T05:49:00.000Z	decay33		hi all
2010-06-16T05:50:00.000Z	decay33		how do i install a program called susi.py
2010-06-16T05:52:00.000Z	decay33		i did and nothing happened
2010-06-16T05:52:00.000Z	decay33		where do i put the file? just on desktop?
2010-06-16T05:52:00.000Z	AAA	decay33	 that is a script, you just run it python susi.py
2010-06-16T05:52:00.000Z	AAA	decay33	 in a terminal
2010-06-16T05:53:00.000Z	AAA	decay33	 chmod a+x susi.py && ./susi.py
2010-06-16T05:54:00.000Z	AAA	decay33	 first do ps aux|grep susi
2010-06-16T05:54:00.000Z	AAA	decay33	 it may be running in the background
2010-06-16T05:56:00.000Z	AAA	decay33	 do the chmod a+x on susi.py, then just ./susi.py :: this assumes python is installed on your machine (is by default) and the script isn't b0rk
2010-06-16T05:58:00.000Z	AAA	decay33	 is that an irc bot?
2010-06-16T05:58:00.000Z	AAA	decay33	 if so, it most likely won't run from your term like you expect
2010-06-16T05:59:00.000Z	AAA	decay33	 you wan't to use that in conjuntion with your irc client then.  I can't help ya there
2010-06-16T06:01:00.000Z	AAA	decay33	 festival
2010-06-16T06:01:00.000Z	AAA	decay33	 apt-get install festival
2010-06-16T06:06:00.000Z	AAA	decay33	 probably /usr/bin/
2010-06-16T06:06:00.000Z	AAA	decay33	 man festival
2010-06-16T06:06:00.000Z	AAA	decay33	 there are tons of docs. it isn't a launch, click and use app
2010-06-16T06:10:00.000Z	AAA	decay33	 neither do I.  you can find out by typing dpkg -L festival
