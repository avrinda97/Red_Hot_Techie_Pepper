2009-02-28T20:44:00.000Z	philipp		but noone sees to notice my problem
2009-02-28T20:45:00.000Z	SiDi	philipp	did you try with brasero ? and btw, saying what error message you get helps people to help you
2009-02-28T20:46:00.000Z	SiDi	philipp	also, check your burning drive is correctly mounted, and check that you can read CDs on it (since burners are obviously also able to read, if it doesnt read its a drive / driver problem, not an app problem)
2009-02-28T20:46:00.000Z	SiDi	philipp	is your drive actually mounted ? when you put a CD with data inside it, does the CD popup in the drives list in nautilus ?
2009-02-28T20:50:00.000Z	SiDi	philipp	well i don't know then. i never use burning apps so i don't know what to do after that, if noone answers here you should have a look at the forums though
2009-02-28T20:52:00.000Z	SiDi	philipp	then maybe its a problem with the rights with which the CD is mounted
2009-02-28T20:53:00.000Z	SiDi	philipp	possibly your system thinks its a normal CD drive and mounts it only with reading rights, instead of read/write rights
2009-02-28T20:53:00.000Z	SiDi	philipp	you should check your /etc/fstab file, there should be a line for your CD burning drive, and on this line, there should be a "ro" amongst the options
2009-02-28T20:53:00.000Z	SiDi	philipp	if you remove it, and then type "sudo mount -a" in a terminal, it should work
2009-02-28T20:54:00.000Z	SiDi	philipp	then its likely your system doesnt recognise the burner... i don't know what to do about that
2009-02-28T20:56:00.000Z	SiDi	philipp	if you cant read / write when you put a CD in the drive, either the drive is not recognised or it is badly mounted. but i can barely help you on that, i don't know much about these subjects
