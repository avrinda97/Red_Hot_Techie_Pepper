2006-07-23T15:35:00.000Z	mnp		LjL; i dont know what a non-standard repository is
2006-07-23T15:35:00.000Z	dyn-afk	mnp	what asus notebook doe you have?

2006-07-23T15:38:00.000Z	mnp	dyn-afk	im having IRQ trouble and my sound card wont work. i have disable acpii in the boot
2006-07-23T15:39:00.000Z	mnp	dyn-afk	yeah, i talked to Lorenzo; he's one of the authors. he sent me his .config file and he told me to compile 2.6.16 and drop his .config in there
2006-07-23T15:42:00.000Z	mnp	dyn-afk	i know that i need acpi on, but if i enable it, the system freezes at start up at the line: "unpacking linux, ok. booting the kernel"
2006-07-23T15:44:00.000Z	mnp	dyn-afk	any idea why that would happen?
2006-07-23T15:45:00.000Z	mnp	dyn-afk	any idea how to fix that?
2006-07-23T15:46:00.000Z	mnp	dyn-afk	ill look again
2006-07-23T15:46:00.000Z	mnp	dyn-afk	send the link once more?
2006-07-23T15:49:00.000Z	mnp	dyn-afk	i rember trying to following the instructions for the acpi for asus stuff but its way over my head and i was told i had to reconfigure the kernel
2006-07-24T16:09:00.000Z	mnp	dyn-afk	i learned about the repos llast week and can't beleive i spent 2 weeks messing around on my own
2006-07-24T09:20:00.000Z	mnp	dyn-afk	i still can't make the changes according to the TuxMobil site for my S1300N notebook
2006-07-24T09:21:00.000Z	mnp	dyn-afk	the patches and compiling are over my head, and im afraid of hoosing my system
