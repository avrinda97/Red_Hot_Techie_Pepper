2008-07-09T20:17:00.000Z	djhash	Ziggy	I wouldn't mind trying kooldock.. wanna tackle an installation together?
2008-07-09T20:18:00.000Z	Ziggy	djhash	What installation you speak of?
2008-07-09T20:18:00.000Z	djhash	Ziggy	i've only tried kiba dock.. and didnt like it much.. but kooldock looks interesting..
2008-07-09T20:21:00.000Z	Ziggy	djhash	I've already installed kooldock through Synaptic Package manager, but I don't know how to run it through Compiz...
2008-07-09T20:24:00.000Z	djhash	Ziggy	try terminal and type "kool" then press tab multiple times and see if it autocompletes or gives you a list.
2008-07-09T20:26:00.000Z	Ziggy	djhash	it gave me a list and  has a -- More -- thing at the bottom, but when I typed "Kool" it said 'bash: kool: command not found'
2008-07-09T20:26:00.000Z	djhash	Ziggy	no.. what I meant.. is type "kool{tab tab}" do the tab after typing kool and dont press enter..
2008-07-09T20:27:00.000Z	Ziggy	djhash	It brought up Accessories-
2008-07-09T20:28:00.000Z	Ziggy	djhash	Accessories for kooldock
2008-07-09T20:29:00.000Z	djhash	Ziggy	try typing kooldock?!
2008-07-09T20:30:00.000Z	Ziggy	djhash	It auto-completed when I typed "Kool" as 'Kooldock'
2008-07-09T20:30:00.000Z	djhash	Ziggy	then press enter.. :-)
2008-07-09T20:31:00.000Z	Ziggy	djhash	I did it shows a list of accessories
2008-07-09T20:33:00.000Z	Ziggy	djhash	Ok it popped-up a window saying "It appears its the first time to run kooldock bla bla bla"
2008-07-09T20:34:00.000Z	Ziggy	djhash	I think I need to configure it somehow either through terminal or Compiz
