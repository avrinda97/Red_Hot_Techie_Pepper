2010-11-08T23:36:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	rinku_kokiri	ok it could be unrelated, have you fot the latest pkgs(update manager)
2010-11-08T23:36:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	rinku_kokiri	tried changing thins, e.g. disable compositing
2010-11-08T23:37:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	rinku_kokiri	but flash crashing could be gfx related
2010-11-08T23:38:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	rinku_kokiri	laptop?
2010-11-08T23:39:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	rinku_kokiri	ok go into alsamixer ( in a terminal and select the output as your creative card instead on the onboard intel
2010-11-08T23:40:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	rinku_kokiri	any other errors occur during this?
2010-11-08T23:41:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	rinku_kokiri	and when you try firefox?
2010-11-08T23:48:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	rinku_kokiri	ok, the only thing i can think of is (besides reinstalling the packages, but i assume you've tried that) is to report the bug and wait
2010-11-08T23:50:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	rinku_kokiri	sorry i couldn't help much
2010-11-08T23:54:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	rinku_kokiri	i do have one other idea though its not great, try OSS
