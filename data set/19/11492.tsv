2008-09-24T05:54:00.000Z	garyc		anybody: Is Dlink DGE-530T pci gigabit lan card plug and play on 6.06 Dapper Drake
2008-09-24T05:54:00.000Z	eDRoaCH	garyc	boot off the live cd and see?
2008-09-24T05:55:00.000Z	eDRoaCH		i didnt have to do anything with drivers, ubu handled it
2008-09-24T05:55:00.000Z	eDRoaCH	garyc	http://www.ubuntuhcl.org/
2008-09-24T05:55:00.000Z	eDRoaCH		glx?
2008-09-24T05:56:00.000Z	eDRoaCH		intel cards are incredibly common and not very fancy
2008-09-24T05:56:00.000Z	garyc	eDRoaCH	why would I do that when 6.06 is running on my HD
2008-09-24T05:56:00.000Z	eDRoaCH		then check the list http://www.ubuntuhcl.org/
2008-09-24T05:56:00.000Z	eDRoaCH		hmm maybe this isnt the official list
2008-09-24T05:57:00.000Z	eDRoaCH		damn you google, first android and now this
2008-09-24T05:57:00.000Z	garyc		eDToaCH: it says the card runs on 7.04 - no word on 6.06
2008-09-24T05:58:00.000Z	eDRoaCH	garyc	you could just go to the manufacturers site and see
2008-09-24T05:58:00.000Z	garyc		eDToaCH: I want to go out and buy one, but thought I would make sure
2008-09-24T05:58:00.000Z	eDRoaCH		then id def go to the manufacturers site and see
2008-09-24T05:59:00.000Z	eDRoaCH		doesnt look like ubu maintains an official HCL, which kinda sucks actually
2008-09-24T05:59:00.000Z	garyc	eDRoaCH	I went there but the Linux support is generic or Redhat in nature
2008-09-24T05:59:00.000Z	eDRoaCH		generic is good
2008-09-24T05:59:00.000Z	eDRoaCH		rpm only is bad
2008-09-24T06:00:00.000Z	garyc	eDRoaCH	just querying to see if anyone used the card on 6.06
