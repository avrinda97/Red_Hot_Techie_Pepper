2011-01-30T15:32:00.000Z	aaron11		I have a problem with my Ubuntu 10.10, I just downloaded an update and after that, the screen will go to a console saying something about a batery power and firefox. I restart it and it was gone, while I was watching a You Tube video the black screen poped up again. I have to restart again and now im here. What should I do?
2011-01-30T15:32:00.000Z	ohzie	aaron11	The error is very very important.
2011-01-30T15:33:00.000Z	ohzie	aaron11	It sounds like a graphics card problem to me
2011-01-30T15:33:00.000Z	aaron11	ohzie	There is no error.
2011-01-30T15:33:00.000Z	ohzie	aaron11	I don't know what the battery/firefox thing could possibly be

2011-01-30T15:48:00.000Z	ohzie	aaron11	run that command, "grep Driver /var/log/Xorg.0.log" that Dr_Willis mentioned.
