2011-10-21T18:51:00.000Z	nils_		hmm my new oneric setup doesn't seem to start the X server
2011-10-21T18:52:00.000Z	devish	nils_	whats the error
2011-10-21T18:52:00.000Z	nils_	devish	doesn't show any, last message I see is mountall: Disconnected from plymouth
2011-10-21T18:53:00.000Z	devish	nils_	so u can login via shell ?
2011-10-21T18:53:00.000Z	nils_	devish	yeah, I can also run X, there is just no login screen
2011-10-21T18:54:00.000Z	devish	nils_	oh login is disabled i suppose its on autologin
2011-10-21T18:54:00.000Z	devish	nils_	just remove that
2011-10-21T18:54:00.000Z	nils_	devish	didn't set autologin, I just tried to start X from the console.
2011-10-21T18:55:00.000Z	devish	nils_	ohhh in that case you have already provided the credentials so why it will ask again
2011-10-21T18:56:00.000Z	devish	nils_	didn't you verify your identity when login into shell
2011-10-21T18:56:00.000Z	nils_	devish	yeah the thing is it doesn't start the X server with the login prompt after booting.
2011-10-21T18:57:00.000Z	devish	nils_	one more guess so xserver is not set as default?
2011-10-21T18:57:00.000Z	devish	nils_	try pressing ctrl +alt f7
2011-10-21T18:58:00.000Z	nils_	devish	it is, maybe it has something to do with installing nvidia drivers
2011-10-21T18:59:00.000Z	devish	nils_	what  pressing ctrl +alt f7gives
2011-10-21T18:59:00.000Z	nils_	devish	the console screen I had after booting
2011-10-21T18:59:00.000Z	devish	nils_	maybe it restores from the last session
2011-10-21T19:00:00.000Z	devish	nils_	you can try updating then upgrading then if the issue exists report back
2011-10-21T19:00:00.000Z	nils_	devish	I'll try, thanks.
