2010-08-30T16:45:00.000Z	industrial		I have compiled and installed Application X (vim 7.3 in my case) to ~/Applications/ApplicationX-0.1/. It is in my path because it is sourced in ~/.bashrc. How do I make my gnome-session and my gnome-do recognize it as something installed so I can start it and assign it to file types in nautilus etc.

2010-08-30T16:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	industrial	 use the 'properties' for a file with the extension you want to assign to it.   and tell it to open with your new vim
2010-08-30T16:47:00.000Z	industrial	Dr_Willis	the problem is 'my new vim' isn't in the list
2010-08-30T16:47:00.000Z	industrial	Dr_Willis	and it's not in the list because I compiled and installed it to my homedir myself, without apt
2010-08-30T16:47:00.000Z	industrial	Dr_Willis	it is however bgin sourced in my bashrc and I can start it from the terminal
2010-08-30T16:48:00.000Z	industrial	Dr_Willis	however my graphical interface doesn't seem to be catching on (or sourcing my .bashrc)
2010-08-30T16:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	industrial	 i tell it to open with whatever app.. giving it the proper FULL path to the app..
2010-08-30T16:48:00.000Z	industrial	Dr_Willis	then I still can't start gvim from my gnome-do.
2010-08-30T16:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	industrial	 because gnomedo is special.. and dosent do it that way.. its also proberly looking for the first item that matches in the path.
2010-08-30T16:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	industrial	 make a script that lauinches your special version and give it a differnt name and put it in your ~/bin perhaps  for gnome do.
2010-08-30T16:50:00.000Z	industrial	Dr_Willis	How are other programs recognized as programs that are startable in the list of applications you can choose from when assigning one to a given file type?
2010-08-30T16:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	industrial	 from the definitions in the various whatever.desktop files i belive.
2010-08-30T16:51:00.000Z	industrial	Dr_Willis	ok.
2010-09-06T16:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	industrial	 you have to click on a empty part of the file listing (and its sort of hard to find a good empty place) or use the menu item. Or are you meaning right clicking ON a directory Icon?  cant say ive ever tried that..
2010-09-06T16:16:00.000Z	industrial	Dr_Willis	well its where I expect it. if the menu item in the File menu does so for the main directory why can't a subdirectory right click menu do it for that subdirectory?
2010-09-06T16:17:00.000Z	industrial	Dr_Willis	I'd like to get somewhere with this. What's the best way to go to the creators of Nautilus? a mailing list somewhere or ticket system?
2010-09-06T16:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	industrial	 post the idea to the brainstorm site. You could make a nautilus script entry that could do it i imagine
