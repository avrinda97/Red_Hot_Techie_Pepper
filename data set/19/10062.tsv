2006-08-01T11:33:00.000Z	ubul4		can i choose which applications i want to install with the alternate iso? (for instance, i don't want openoffice.)
2006-08-01T11:34:00.000Z	shawnr_	ubul4	why don't you just install debian sarge, then add whatever you want
2006-08-01T11:34:00.000Z	shawnr_	ubul4	or just remove everything you don't want after ubuntu install
2006-08-01T11:34:00.000Z	shawnr_	ubul4	or try the alternate iso, i don't know if it gives you that option though, someone else in here might
2006-08-01T11:35:00.000Z	ubul4	shawnr_	i prefer a quick install, so it would be better if i could choose before
2006-08-01T11:36:00.000Z	shawnr_	ubul4	why don't you just go the debian sarge route, you can install the absolute minimal debian system. then add gnome and whatever else you like
2006-08-01T11:36:00.000Z	ubul4	shawnr_	where can i find the minimal debian iso?
2006-08-01T11:38:00.000Z	ubul4	shawnr_	debian seems to be 14cds...
2006-08-01T11:39:00.000Z	shawnr_	ubul4	you only need the first
2006-08-01T11:39:00.000Z	shawnr_	ubul4	as long as you have a net connection you can install everything else from the repositories
2006-08-01T11:39:00.000Z	ubul4	shawnr_	do you mean this one? debian-31r2-i386-binary-1.iso.torrent
2006-08-01T11:39:00.000Z	shawnr_	ubul4	yes
2006-08-01T11:40:00.000Z	ubul4	shawnr_	ok, thx i'll go ahead and download that right now
2006-08-01T11:41:00.000Z	shawnr_	ubul4	from here on out ask for help in #debian if thats the route your gonna take
2006-08-01T11:41:00.000Z	ubul4	shawnr_	would you say that the debian route is a harder route?
2006-08-01T11:42:00.000Z	shawnr_	ubul4	i wouldn't no.. its not "harder". just that the setup isn't as "automatic" as ubuntu. ubuntu uses the live cd, and configures everything for you
2006-08-01T11:43:00.000Z	shawnr_	ubul4	its all menu based.
2006-08-01T11:43:00.000Z	ubul4	shawnr_	and debian is not menu based installation?
2006-08-01T11:44:00.000Z	shawnr_	ubul4	no im saying debian install IS menu based
