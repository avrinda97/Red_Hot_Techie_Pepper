2008-08-13T22:41:00.000Z	qrush		ctrl + alt + f1 put me into a terminal only
2008-08-13T22:41:00.000Z	qrush		i just wanted the gui to restart
2008-08-13T22:41:00.000Z	qrush		like killing explorer in windows.
2008-08-13T22:42:00.000Z	Sylphid|work	qrush	ctrl + alt + backspace
2008-08-13T22:44:00.000Z	Sylphid|work	qrush	what exactly are you trying to do?
2008-08-13T22:44:00.000Z	qrush	Sylphid|work	restart the gnome gui without killing my apps
2008-08-13T22:45:00.000Z	qrush	Sylphid|work	with windows you can open up task manager even if explorer or your apps are frozen, kill explorer, and restart it
2008-08-13T22:45:00.000Z	Sylphid|work	qrush	i cant say that i know an easy way to do that.... looking
2008-08-13T22:48:00.000Z	qrush	Sylphid|work	thanks
2008-08-13T22:50:00.000Z	Sylphid|work	qrush	killall gnome-panel && gnome-panel
2008-08-13T22:51:00.000Z	qrush	Sylphid|work	thanks, i'll keep it mind :)
2008-08-13T22:51:00.000Z	qrush	Sylphid|work	here's another. is there a shortcut for opening a terminal?
2008-08-13T22:52:00.000Z	Sylphid|work	qrush	not by default however alt +f2 will open a run dialog box to start a terminal or you can bind a key to start it via system > preferences > keyboard shortcuts
2008-08-13T22:52:00.000Z	qrush	Sylphid|work	that freezes up too though when gnome-panel does
2008-08-13T22:52:00.000Z	qrush	Sylphid|work	i'll have to bind a key then.
2008-08-13T22:53:00.000Z	Sylphid|work	qrush	and theres alway ctrl + alt + f1-6 for tty's
2008-08-13T22:53:00.000Z	qrush	Sylphid|work	what? ttys?
2008-08-13T22:54:00.000Z	Sylphid|work	qrush	its a terminal w/o a gui ... use ctrl + alt + f7 to get back to the gui
