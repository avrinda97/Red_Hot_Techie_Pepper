2011-11-01T22:16:00.000Z	wxl		sudo luke i am your father
2011-11-01T22:17:00.000Z	wxl		just make sure you disconnect your computer frmo the network before you start sudoing everything under the sun, reisio .. at least if you value it
2011-11-01T22:18:00.000Z	reisio	wxl	lspci is not everything under the sun
2011-11-01T22:18:00.000Z	wxl	reisio	by extension you might as well sudo ls and sudo cd, too
2011-11-01T22:18:00.000Z	reisio	wxl	not really
2011-11-01T22:19:00.000Z	reisio	wxl	ls and cd do not require root in other distros, lspci does
2011-11-01T22:19:00.000Z	wxl	reisio	oh get really fancy and start sudoing gui apps; that's always fun
2011-11-01T22:20:00.000Z	reisio	wxl	what's funny about this conversation is that between us I'm the only one who's used more than one distro
2011-11-01T22:20:00.000Z	wxl	reisio	that's interesting. your psychic abilitities are failing you, unfortunately.
2011-11-01T22:20:00.000Z	reisio	wxl	psychic abilities don't factor into it
2011-11-01T22:22:00.000Z	wxl	reisio	well then you've just assumed incorrectly
2011-11-01T22:22:00.000Z	reisio	wxl	it's important to you for me to think that, isn't it :p
2011-11-01T22:23:00.000Z	wxl	reisio	i think it's important that you don't lead people towards insecure systems-- that's the point
2011-11-01T22:23:00.000Z	reisio	wxl	there's nothing insecure about sudo lspci
2011-11-01T22:24:00.000Z	wxl	reisio	how many minutes is a sudo good for? i.e. how long do you retain superuser privs after one command?
2011-11-01T22:25:00.000Z	wxl	reisio	for that matter, what is sudo?
2011-11-01T22:25:00.000Z	reisio	wxl	you tell me what sudo is
2011-11-01T22:25:00.000Z	wxl	reisio	super user do, baby. ultimate power.
2011-11-01T22:26:00.000Z	reisio	wxl	and if Ubuntu users weren't constantly running sudo, I'm sure that'd matter
