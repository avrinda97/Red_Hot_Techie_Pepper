2011-08-08T05:59:00.000Z	diamonds		pidgin less than ideal for irc, imo
2011-08-08T06:00:00.000Z	diamonds		yeah
2011-08-08T06:00:00.000Z	diamonds		I want to try xchat
2011-08-08T06:00:00.000Z	diamonds		irssi was a bit... complex
2011-08-08T06:00:00.000Z	diamonds		but I should probably give it another go
2011-08-08T06:01:00.000Z	diamonds		do they integrate with the desktop notification system?
2011-08-08T06:01:00.000Z	diamonds		on mac this was always an issue...
2011-08-08T06:02:00.000Z	diamonds		anyone know how to switch tabs in empathy?
2011-08-08T06:02:00.000Z	diamonds		while I'm here? :p
2011-08-08T06:02:00.000Z	KM0201	diamonds	you install a real irc client..lol
2011-08-08T06:04:00.000Z	diamonds	KM0201	I mean "easier for a beginner" not best
2011-08-08T06:04:00.000Z	KM0201	diamonds	still, really.. the same thing... if you're really used to Unity, you probably won't like gnome, i was really used to Gnome 2.x, and found unity horrid
2011-08-08T06:05:00.000Z	diamonds	KM0201	I'm not used to it :p
2011-08-08T06:05:00.000Z	KM0201	diamonds	if you intend to stick w/ Ubuntu, personally... i would stay w/ unity..
2011-08-08T06:06:00.000Z	diamonds	KM0201	ok ty!
2012-08-20T08:04:00.000Z	KM0201	diamonds	lots of people.
