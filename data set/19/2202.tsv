2010-11-01T06:50:00.000Z	Snakkah		Hello. I was wondering if it's possible to do a minimal install of Ubuntu (just the OS without the GUI) and install a custom GUI on top of it?
2010-11-01T06:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Snakkah	sure, there is a minimal iso
2010-11-01T06:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Snakkah	i'd go with minimal
2010-11-01T06:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Snakkah	yeah, minimal is great for that, get it installed, setup networking (wired makes this waaay easier) then install openbox and go make some food :)
2011-01-05T03:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Snakkah	thats your icon theme
2011-01-17T16:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Snakkah	if you open sound properties you can change the sound theme
2011-01-17T16:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Snakkah	there are sound themes in the repos as far as I am aware
2011-01-17T16:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Snakkah	I guess if you find the file you can just replace it
2011-01-17T16:10:00.000Z	Snakkah	ActionParsnip	that's what I'm thinking too. I was hoping someone here could direct me to where it is lol.
2011-01-17T16:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Snakkah	sudo find / -iname "*.ogg"   maybe
2011-02-04T10:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Snakkah	is the pwd in the folder or a subfolder?
2011-02-04T10:44:00.000Z	Snakkah	ActionParsnip	pwd?
2011-02-04T10:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Snakkah	present working directory
2011-02-04T10:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Snakkah	if you run:   pwd   it will tell you the path you are currently standing in
2011-02-04T10:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Snakkah	ok is the partition healthy? If it is NTFS was it gracefully unmounted when it was last removed from a system
2011-02-04T10:46:00.000Z	Snakkah	ActionParsnip	the partition is fine. I'm thinking when transferring my files it may have gotten moved around though.
2011-05-06T23:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Snakkah	the panels factoid shows how to reset one folder in gconf. Just change the item reset to /  then logout and login and you should get vanilla settingz
2011-06-14T08:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Snakkah	check the appdb for the games you want to play
2011-06-14T08:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Snakkah	disable 3D accelleration
