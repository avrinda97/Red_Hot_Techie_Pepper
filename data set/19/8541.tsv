2007-09-13T16:29:00.000Z	Andeh		I wish lame wasn't so lame...
2007-09-13T16:30:00.000Z	rob_p	Andeh	I know ifor sure that it can.  I've used it to do just that.  Not aware of a front end for it though.  I wrote a script to do it for me.
2007-09-13T16:30:00.000Z	Andeh	rob_p	A script?
2007-09-13T16:31:00.000Z	rob_p	Andeh	Yeah, as in shell script.
2007-09-13T16:31:00.000Z	Andeh	rob_p	Why?
2007-09-13T16:32:00.000Z	rob_p	Andeh	I had a directory with hundreds of MP3s that I wanted to downsample.  So I used a script to do it for me.
2007-09-13T16:34:00.000Z	rob_p	Andeh	But anyway, my point is that lame can do it.
