2005-01-03T17:30:00.000Z	bob2		that's one use of it
2005-01-03T06:01:00.000Z	bob2		http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/Kubuntu
2005-01-03T06:01:00.000Z	bob2		no, you're confused
2005-01-03T06:01:00.000Z	bob2		support = will fix bugs in
2005-01-03T06:02:00.000Z	bob2		nearly all of sid is avaiable, but canonical will not go out of it's way to fix bugs in random software
2005-01-03T06:03:00.000Z	bob2		you can file bugs in the debian bts
2005-01-03T06:03:00.000Z	bob2		or ask for help on the ubuntu-user list
2005-01-03T06:03:00.000Z	nakee	bob2	how do I know which packages are supported?
2005-01-03T06:04:00.000Z	bob2		the ones in 'main' are supported
2005-01-03T06:04:00.000Z	bob2		in aptitude and apt that's easy to see, I believe synaptic puts an ubuntu logo next to them
2005-01-03T06:06:00.000Z	nakee		Kubuntu is a whole diffrent distribution or just a project to get kde as integrated into ubuntu main tree?
2005-01-03T06:11:00.000Z	bob2		it's going to be a derivative distribution, aiui
2005-01-03T06:11:00.000Z	nakee		too bad, what a waste of resources
2005-01-03T06:12:00.000Z	bob2		no
2005-01-03T06:12:00.000Z	bob2		please don't make judgements when don't know the full story :)
2005-01-03T06:14:00.000Z	nakee	bob2	you are right, I just think people too often use forking as a way not to compromise/work with each other, instead of working on their man to man skill, I don't know if it's the case on this case but I saw it happen too often
2005-01-03T06:15:00.000Z	nakee		and more of the time forking creates a olot of uneeded overhead
2005-01-03T06:15:00.000Z	nakee		s/more/most
2005-01-03T06:15:00.000Z	bob2	nakee	that is not the case for kubuntu
