2006-07-31T05:30:00.000Z	soundray	J-_	check on www.linuxprinting.org : there is a driver called lm1100 which may work with your allinone
2006-10-13T11:45:00.000Z	soundray	J-_	set that in System-Preferences-Removable Drives...
2006-10-13T11:46:00.000Z	J-_	soundray	thanks
2006-10-13T11:46:00.000Z	soundray	J-_	thank jrib. jrib was faster :)
2006-11-03T12:32:00.000Z	soundray	J-_	links2 has a graphical mode I hear
2006-11-03T12:33:00.000Z	soundray	J-_	dillo is another light browser
2006-11-03T12:34:00.000Z	J-_	soundray	cool, thanks.
2007-04-20T11:56:00.000Z	soundray	J-_	yes. You can connect to the server from the graphical machine with 'ssh -X server' and have all X programs redirected their output to your local screen.
2007-04-20T11:57:00.000Z	J-_	soundray	cool, pretty interesting.
2007-04-20T11:57:00.000Z	J-_	soundray	thought I was onto something new  and cool =X lol
2007-04-20T11:58:00.000Z	soundray	J-_	X was designed with this kind of network use in mind
2007-04-20T12:00:00.000Z	J-_	soundray	cool, never knew that. I thought that I needed to have both systems GUI to actually SSH into one and have a GUI working on the server as well.
2007-04-20T12:02:00.000Z	soundray	J-_	well, you need some client X libraries on the server, but not the actual X server and graphics drivers.
2007-10-13T15:05:00.000Z	soundray	J-_	it's possible that it does have 3D accel. Find out the graphics chipset with lspci
2007-10-13T15:09:00.000Z	soundray	J-_	did you get my line?
2007-10-13T15:09:00.000Z	J-_	soundray	about the lspci?
2007-10-13T15:09:00.000Z	soundray	J-_	yes
