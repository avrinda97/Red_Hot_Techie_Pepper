2006-12-19T14:09:00.000Z	thoreauputic	amphacid	I never needed to use email to register
2006-12-19T14:10:00.000Z	thoreauputic	amphacid	hmm OK - just not something I ever needed to use I guess :)
2006-12-19T14:10:00.000Z	amphacid	thoreauputic	depends on the channel
2006-12-19T14:10:00.000Z	amphacid	thoreauputic	some need to
2006-12-19T14:10:00.000Z	thoreauputic	amphacid	I see
2006-12-19T14:11:00.000Z	amphacid	thoreauputic	i can manage to access to my partitions (i try to install on a new pc, no os before)
2006-12-19T14:12:00.000Z	thoreauputic	amphacid	are they mounted? Try sudo fdisk -l to see what is there, and "mount" to see what is mounted ?
2006-12-19T14:13:00.000Z	amphacid	thoreauputic	can i do it on live cd?
2006-12-19T14:13:00.000Z	thoreauputic	amphacid	.... erm, what are you actually doing? Are you installing?
2006-12-19T14:14:00.000Z	thoreauputic	amphacid	what partitioning method are you using? Manual ?
2006-12-19T14:16:00.000Z	amphacid	thoreauputic	gparted start and i can't even choose the method
2006-12-19T14:17:00.000Z	thoreauputic	amphacid	Personally I would suggest that you use the alternate CD for installing - it often gets around issues that the live CD has
2006-12-19T14:17:00.000Z	thoreauputic	amphacid	do you have a lot of RAM ? How much? What cpu?
2006-12-19T14:17:00.000Z	amphacid	thoreauputic	i'm gonna try, i'll be back soon
