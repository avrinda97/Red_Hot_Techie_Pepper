2008-06-26T02:46:00.000Z	philh	Defaul1	is there a reason why you need to compile the drivers?
2008-06-26T02:47:00.000Z	Defaul1	philh	The installer compiles the kernel if it cannot find a compatible one
2008-06-26T02:48:00.000Z	philh	Defaul1	does the driver from the repository not work or something?
2008-06-26T02:49:00.000Z	Defaul1	philh	Yeah when I tried it the X Windows system crashes until I restore the xorg.conf file
2008-06-26T02:50:00.000Z	philh	Defaul1	ouch, what's your card?
2008-06-26T02:51:00.000Z	Defaul1	philh	It is an 8800GTS
2008-06-26T02:51:00.000Z	philh	Defaul1	oh, beyond my experience
2008-06-26T02:52:00.000Z	philh	Defaul1	have you installed your kernel source package?
2008-06-26T02:52:00.000Z	philh	Defaul1	and compiler
2008-06-26T02:53:00.000Z	Defaul1	philh	From what I am aware of I have, however Ubuntu Studio runs on another kernel which ends in -rt and I may of had difficulty finding the correct files
2008-06-26T02:54:00.000Z	philh	Defaul1	ah, i see what you mean
2008-06-26T02:58:00.000Z	philh	Defaul1	i'm afraid all i can think of is to google hard until you find either a full patched kernel or the RT patches that correspond to your current running kernel
2008-06-26T02:59:00.000Z	Defaul1	philh	Ok, I'm Googling right now for a solution, thanks for the help
2008-06-26T03:08:00.000Z	philh	Defaul1	linux-headers-rt is in the repos
2008-06-26T03:09:00.000Z	philh	Defaul1	not sure if it's for the same kernel but the ubuntustudio package list doesn't list a kernel so it probably uses the standard ubuntu linux-image-rt package
2008-06-26T03:10:00.000Z	Defaul1	philh	Ok I will check those out, thanks
2008-06-26T03:10:00.000Z	philh	Defaul1	np, let me know how it goes
2008-06-26T03:11:00.000Z	Defaul1	philh	Ok
2008-06-26T03:21:00.000Z	Defaul1	philh	I tried to install the drivers after installing the header and kernel files, but I still got an error while compiling the kernel
