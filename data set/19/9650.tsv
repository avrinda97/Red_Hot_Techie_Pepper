2006-10-08T11:46:00.000Z	Zoffix_		Hi, I've just installed Ubuntu 6.10, and I want it to boot up in text mode, for some reason I can't find 'inittab' file. It is not in /etc and 'find' produced no results. Did anybody have a similar problem?
2006-10-08T11:46:00.000Z	Sionide	Zoffix_	$ locate inittab   /etc/inittab    <- it's there for me..
2006-10-08T11:49:00.000Z	Sionide	Zoffix_	it is
2006-10-08T11:51:00.000Z	Sionide	Zoffix_	Edgy is 6.10
2006-10-08T11:51:00.000Z	Sionide	Zoffix_	Dapper is 6.06
2006-10-08T11:53:00.000Z	Zoffix_	Sionide	ok, when I run zoffix@zoffix:~$ locate inittab  I get this: /usr/lib/upstart/migrate-inittab.pl     should I run this script or what?
2006-10-08T11:54:00.000Z	Sionide	Zoffix_	really not sure, i'm just saying it's ok on my machine so i've no idea how to proceed on yours.. sorry
2006-10-08T11:55:00.000Z	Zoffix_	Sionide	well, it seems like the script won't even run, because it checks to see if there is /etc/inittab and it is not there =(
2006-10-08T11:55:00.000Z	Sionide	Zoffix_	i dunno i guess you could copy mine and put it there manually, yourself?? i'm just guessing now..
2006-10-08T11:56:00.000Z	Zoffix_	Sionide	yeah that would be a decent idea
2006-10-08T11:56:00.000Z	Zoffix_	Sionide	can you paste it? http://sial.org/pbot/
2006-10-08T11:57:00.000Z	Sionide	Zoffix_	so are you not even able to properly boot up at all then or what?
2006-10-08T11:58:00.000Z	Zoffix_	Sionide	no, it boots up fine, but in graphical mode, I want it to boot in text mode
2006-10-08T11:58:00.000Z	Sionide	Zoffix_	ah i see, but i'm wondering *how* can it boot up fine if there is no inittab ?
2006-10-08T11:58:00.000Z	Sionide	Zoffix_	ctrl+alt+f1 or f2 or f3 etc
2006-10-08T11:59:00.000Z	Sionide	Zoffix_	oh right oops to boot i dunno..
2006-10-08T12:00:00.000Z	Zoffix_	Sionide	hehe, I know of that, I just need to reboot the X without rebooting the whole system, it seems that the reason why I can't find inittab is because of that Upstart thing, I'm reading now :)
2006-10-08T12:01:00.000Z	Sionide	Zoffix_	awesome, good thinking from bruenig then
2006-10-08T12:25:00.000Z	Zoffix_	Sionide	are you still here? Can you please paste me that file? #ubuntu+1 seems to be dead for now
