2005-08-26T16:29:00.000Z	Grat	leo_	yes
2005-08-26T16:30:00.000Z	Grat	leo_	contact them and ask them if they can open it for you (and then change port back to 80) or use that kind of name
2005-08-26T16:31:00.000Z	Grat	leo_	contact your isp and ask them about it
2005-08-26T16:33:00.000Z	Grat	leo_	you can make an account on zoneedit, put your domain there and use the webforward option
2005-08-26T16:34:00.000Z	Grat	leo_	then they will forward your domain to http://yourip:8080
2005-08-26T16:35:00.000Z	Grat	leo_	i dont know if afraid has that option. i prefer zoneedit
2005-08-26T16:36:00.000Z	Grat	leo_	i think if you ask the isp nicely they should open the port, if not call them every 2 hours for a few days and cry on the phone :>
