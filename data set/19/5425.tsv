2008-07-05T02:17:00.000Z	Bullit		ow to change the rights of a map
2008-07-05T02:17:00.000Z	unop	Bullit	you forgot sudo
2008-07-05T02:18:00.000Z	unop	Bullit	that's the way it should be, you don't want to change permissions on these files
2008-07-05T02:19:00.000Z	unop	Bullit	yes, i understand that, but you are copying system files across, these files require that you have the right permissions on them
2008-07-05T02:21:00.000Z	unop	Bullit	when dealing with system files -- just use sudo -- you really should start getting used to using sudo
2008-07-05T02:22:00.000Z	unop	Bullit	sudo -i # to invoke a root shell
2008-07-05T02:23:00.000Z	Bullit	unop	, i still dont got the acces to graphical change stuff
2008-07-05T02:24:00.000Z	unop	Bullit	it's not a good idea doing this, be very careful --  ALT+F2  and type in  gksu  nautilus
2008-07-05T02:27:00.000Z	unop	Bullit	no, it just takes getting used to
2008-07-05T02:30:00.000Z	Bullit	unop	how to use gsuk nautilus to aplly the rights for 1 map to all sublaying maps ?
2008-07-05T02:31:00.000Z	unop	Bullit	can i first ask you - are you makign a backup of your /boot partition ??
2008-07-05T02:32:00.000Z	Bullit	unop	no im copying a backtrack3 slax version from usb to a hardrive
2008-07-05T02:33:00.000Z	Bullit	unop	i got full permision on the original files on usb , but no permisions when the files are on the HD ?
2008-07-05T02:34:00.000Z	unop	Bullit	see, this is how it is..  system files require very specific permissions on them or else you break security and also stop things from working -- stop trying to change these permissions, just copy them over with sudo and all will be good :)
2008-07-05T02:35:00.000Z	unop	Bullit	that is not the issue, if you change the permissions - your slax thing will suffer - do you really want that? i don't think so
2008-07-05T02:35:00.000Z	unop	Bullit	because slax requires the security or right permissions
2008-07-05T02:38:00.000Z	unop	Bullit	what filesystem on the USB disk? FAT ?
2008-07-05T02:39:00.000Z	Bullit	unop	, yes probably
2008-07-05T02:40:00.000Z	unop	Bullit	does backtrack3 have a source package?
