2007-11-22T04:38:00.000Z	misterecs		UBUNTU NEWBIE --> My NIC is not recognized by Ubuntu. Please Help. It's DELL Ubuntu Box, and worked fine out of the box, but upon a FRESH INSTALL, now fails to be recognized by the system. HELP!
2007-11-22T04:39:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	misterecs	Failure to be recognized is different from failing to work. In a terminal type "lspci | grep Ethernet" without quotes
2007-11-22T04:48:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	misterecs	There you go. It's being detected. So why don't you describe what you're trying to do, how you're doing it, and any error messages (if any) that you get.
2007-11-22T04:53:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	misterecs	It should be possible to describe it here... and you'll have a better chance of others helping if they don't have to click a link to get to your problem. Try describing the problem in four sentences and then we can ask for more info if needed.
2007-11-22T04:54:00.000Z	misterecs	ArthurArchnix	--> Okay, will do.
2007-11-22T04:59:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	misterecs	Heh. Ok, so you're trying to connect to the internet and you can't. And your on 7.04, and we already know that its detected by the OS since we can see it with the lspci command.
2007-11-22T04:59:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	misterecs	Do you see a network thing on your panel, like network manager in the top right?
2007-11-22T05:02:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	misterecs	Ok, it sounds like your in the network manager window. That's connected with /etc/network/interfaces I think. 7.04 is different from 7.10, so I can't try any of this myself. But can you post the output of "cat /etc/network/interfaces" without quotes
2007-11-22T05:02:00.000Z	misterecs	ArthurArchnix	==> Will do, one moment.
2007-11-22T05:10:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	misterecs	That looks ok to me... but then, I'm using gutsy. paste the output of "ifconfig -a"
2007-11-22T05:27:00.000Z	misterecs	ArthurArchnix	==> Are we still good? Any Ideas? My post is at: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/45434/

2007-11-22T05:31:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	misterecs	I've seen your post, but am working on something else right now. You can wait a bit or put your question to the channel. If you ask your question again be sure to mention that you're using Feisty, that lspci can detect your card, but that ifconfig -a doesn't show it.
2007-11-22T05:32:00.000Z	misterecs	ArthurArchnix	==> Got it, thanks.
2007-11-22T05:42:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	misterecs	 Your lspci was "0:19.0 Ethernet controller: Intel Corporation Unknown device 10c0", I think that means it doesn't know what driver to load.
2007-11-22T05:43:00.000Z	misterecs	ArthurArchnix	==> i THINK i've got a Generic Driver from Intel for my integrated NIC, its "Tarballs", would it help if I tried to install that?
2007-11-22T05:44:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	misterecs	Yes. You need to do that, OR try this thread http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=3370406 OR install gutsy, which has it included already.
