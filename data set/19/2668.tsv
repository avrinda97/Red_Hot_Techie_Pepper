2010-03-02T20:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	brokepunk	sup
2010-03-02T20:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	brokepunk	you said you were having issues in vbox?
2010-03-02T20:38:00.000Z	brokepunk	ActionParsnip	Yes sir, cannot get an xp guest client to see a 2k8 server guest
2010-03-02T20:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	brokepunk	have you used bridged LAN for both systems?
2010-03-02T20:39:00.000Z	brokepunk	ActionParsnip	Tried all the networking options... I can get them to ping but cannot get the xp maching to join the 2k8 server...
2010-03-02T20:39:00.000Z	brokepunk	ActionParsnip	tried bridged and internal network
2010-03-02T20:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	brokepunk	if they can ping then your support is in ##windows
2010-03-02T20:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	brokepunk	oce their is a logical link the issue is windows based
2010-03-02T20:40:00.000Z	brokepunk	ActionParsnip	Thanks, Ill try that...
2010-03-02T20:40:00.000Z	brokepunk	ActionParsnip	Makes sense
2010-03-02T20:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	brokepunk	no worries duder
2010-03-02T21:16:00.000Z	brokepunk	ActionParsnip	you are doing backups to the same place you have your torrents?
2010-03-02T21:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	brokepunk	no, to a firewire hdd
2010-03-02T21:17:00.000Z	brokepunk	ActionParsnip	ok... bad business, that
2010-03-02T21:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	brokepunk	why?
2010-03-02T21:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	brokepunk	stuff is stored locally, backup runs every night to the firewire
2010-03-02T21:17:00.000Z	brokepunk	ActionParsnip	if all you have is nameless data in your backups, I guess not bad at all..
2010-03-02T21:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	brokepunk	its worked for a good while
