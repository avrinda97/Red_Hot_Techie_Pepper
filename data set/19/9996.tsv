2006-08-16T15:55:00.000Z	piclez		hi, how can I findout if there is something running in port 2000 please?
2006-08-16T15:55:00.000Z	enyc	piclez	what do you mean.... listening on TCP port 5000? or UDP port 5000?  or something connecting from your machtine to port 5000 somewhere else?
2006-08-16T15:57:00.000Z	piclez	enyc	thanks! nhmm I'm trying to install ofbiz and run tnameserv (Cordoba I think) on port 2000 but something must be using this port because it can't bind to port 2000, so I think is TCP listening
2006-08-16T15:58:00.000Z	enyc	piclez	right... do 'netstat -ltn' to see what is listening on TCP ports on your machine
2006-08-16T15:58:00.000Z	piclez	enyc	thank you a lot :)
2006-08-16T15:59:00.000Z	enyc	piclez	aghually...
2006-08-16T15:59:00.000Z	piclez	enyc	nothing on that port, so must be something else :/ tks :)
2006-08-16T15:59:00.000Z	enyc	piclez	do 'netstat -ltnp' to see what program listening on what port ;--)
2006-08-16T16:00:00.000Z	enyc	piclez	pou may need  'sudo netstat -ltnp'.... to see all processes etc.
