2010-08-23T01:11:00.000Z	netsavy006		E: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), are you root?
2010-08-23T01:12:00.000Z	netsavy006		that's what I'm going to try now.
2010-08-23T01:13:00.000Z	netsavy006		I need to install dchroot but I got this message from the terminal:  E: Couldn't find package dchroot
2010-08-23T01:13:00.000Z	netsavy006		I'm not 100% sure, but that was the last thing I did on the computer .
2010-08-23T01:13:00.000Z	netsavy006		before rebooting.[
2010-08-23T01:14:00.000Z	netsavy006		Are you asking me to reinstall my OS?
2010-08-23T01:15:00.000Z	netsavy006		because I don't want to do that if I don't have to.
2010-08-23T01:15:00.000Z	netsavy006		Oh ok.
2010-08-23T01:17:00.000Z	netsavy006		I think it did.  I'm not 100% sure.  I'm hoping that that's the cause.
2010-08-23T01:17:00.000Z	netsavy006		so that what we are doing will fix the problem
2010-08-23T01:19:00.000Z	collabra	netsavy006	: have you tried the vesa driver in xorg
2010-08-23T01:23:00.000Z	collabra	netsavy006	the recovery mode might just enable the vesa driver by default
2010-08-23T01:24:00.000Z	collabra	netsavy006	no it's the <shift> key
2010-08-23T01:25:00.000Z	collabra	netsavy006	: yeah
2010-08-23T01:26:00.000Z	collabra	netsavy006	: it will give you an option to do a recovery boot.
2010-08-23T01:43:00.000Z	collabra	netsavy006	you could swap the video driver while in text mode
2010-08-23T01:44:00.000Z	collabra	netsavy006	at least you would have a booted system,... more than you had before
2010-08-23T01:46:00.000Z	collabra	netsavy006	: you could potentially use tools like apt or aptitude to do it for you
2010-08-23T03:34:00.000Z	netsavy006	collabra	 I had to reinstall because my /boot partiton died..  I couldn't even boot as far as getting to "Grub"
