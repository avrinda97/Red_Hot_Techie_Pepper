2005-05-24T10:33:00.000Z	gregg_		man. I hate all these "alternative" bittorrent clients like Azureus
2005-05-24T10:34:00.000Z	gregg_		they harm the network and try to make a bad edonkey out of it. great...
2005-05-24T10:34:00.000Z	gregg_		for one thing, they allow multiple downloads
2005-05-24T10:35:00.000Z	gregg_		this is possible with the original client as well, but much more different
2005-05-24T10:36:00.000Z	Funraiser	gregg_	some people have an upload so high (my brother has 1 mga on upload) that even when downloading multiple files, he is still the one uploading the most
2005-05-24T10:38:00.000Z	gregg_	Funraiser	well? I guess most people do multiple torrents when it's much easier
2005-05-24T10:38:00.000Z	gregg_	Funraiser	less then 1% of the bittorrent crowd has such an upstream I guess :)
2005-05-24T10:39:00.000Z	gregg_	Funraiser	you ran a tracker or something?
2005-05-24T10:39:00.000Z	gregg_	Funraiser	as I said, so they are just doing bad things to themselves IMHO
2005-05-24T10:43:00.000Z	gregg_	Funraiser	so what will happen if usenet for warez gets popular?
2005-05-24T10:44:00.000Z	Funraiser	gregg_	there is IRC channels too, XDCC thing
2005-05-25T14:08:00.000Z	gregg_	Funraiser	really? by copy & past'ing instructions?
2005-05-25T14:09:00.000Z	Funraiser	gregg_	well u can copy/past and u can try to understand what that means
2005-05-25T14:09:00.000Z	gregg_	Funraiser	but you can also copy & paste and don't do it... that's my point
2005-05-25T14:10:00.000Z	Funraiser	gregg_	ok but when I do it, i try to understand what that means
2005-05-25T14:10:00.000Z	gregg_	Funraiser	I just think many guys install LFS by simple copy&pasting because its cool and l33t
2005-05-25T14:13:00.000Z	Funraiser	gregg_	I came to linux in part because i wanted to be in control,so LFS is just one more step in that direction
2005-05-25T14:13:00.000Z	gregg_	Funraiser	that's perfectly ok. I guess you don't use an LFS system anymore, though?
2005-05-25T14:14:00.000Z	Funraiser	gregg_	well not yet, i'm using linux for only like 2 months...
