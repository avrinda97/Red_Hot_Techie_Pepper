2010-06-26T03:59:00.000Z	actionParsnip	peturi	what does it do?
2010-06-26T03:59:00.000Z	peturi	actionParsnip	it makes your gum feel funny
2010-06-26T03:59:00.000Z	actionParsnip	peturi	how is that related to ubuntu support?
2010-06-26T04:00:00.000Z	peturi	actionParsnip	It makes me feel more helpful and a bit more talky, so i come here to help users
2010-06-26T04:13:00.000Z	actionParsnip	peturi	Ricky123 : to re-disable root use: sudo usermod -p '!' root
2010-06-26T04:18:00.000Z	actionParsnip	peturi	why not just use: sudo -i    ?
2010-06-26T04:19:00.000Z	peturi	actionParsnip	He said he wants to login as root.
2010-06-26T04:19:00.000Z	peturi	actionParsnip	i already suggested the sudoers file
2010-06-26T04:19:00.000Z	actionParsnip	peturi	its not supported or advised (and is really dumb)
2010-06-26T04:19:00.000Z	peturi	actionParsnip	Yes it's supported, and yes it's dumb
2010-06-26T04:21:00.000Z	peturi	actionParsnip	How do you mean you don't support it? It works just fine
2010-06-26T04:21:00.000Z	actionParsnip	peturi	its NOT supported. to logon as root you need a root password, ubottu clearly shows "We do not support having a root password set" SO IT IS ERGO NOT SUPPORTED
2010-06-26T04:22:00.000Z	actionParsnip	peturi	A lot of other things may work fine and may equally be not supoprted
2010-06-26T04:23:00.000Z	actionParsnip	peturi	envy may work fine but is also not supported here
2010-06-26T04:23:00.000Z	peturi	actionParsnip	How am I supposed to know what is supported and what is not? Just because it's not enabled by default doesn't mean it's not supported. Your argument is invalid as far as i can see, using it I could argue that anonymous ftp access it not supported as well.
2010-06-26T04:24:00.000Z	actionParsnip	peturi	maybe you don't but if you don't know then say it is supported, then you look foolish
2010-06-26T04:26:00.000Z	peturi	actionParsnip	openSSH clearly supports logging as root and the default /etc/ssh/sshd_config file shipped on the Ubuntu 10.04 CD contains the line "PermitRootLogin yes", so from all i can see its supported, please refer me to a documentation showing otherwise.
2010-06-26T04:29:00.000Z	actionParsnip	peturi	maybe but if the account is disabld its not going to work
