2007-02-01T12:56:00.000Z	eleazar123		can anybody help me with grub?
2007-02-01T12:58:00.000Z	eleazar123		hey guys, everytime i install ubuntu grub is configured incorrectly and i have to spend a lot of time manually configuring it, i'm about to install ubuntu now, is there anyway for me to figure out which drive grub should be installed on? i think it might be b/c all of my drives are sata
2007-02-01T12:58:00.000Z	Stormx2	eleazar123	How exactly does it misconfigure, what does it do? Prehaps back up your menu.list?
2007-02-01T12:57:00.000Z	Stormx2	eleazar123	Not unless you tell us the problem...
2007-02-01T12:57:00.000Z	eleazar123	Stormx2	i did, but nobody replied :(
2007-02-01T12:57:00.000Z	Stormx2	eleazar123	Ah. Well ask again, please (hit the up arrow if you use X-Chat)
2007-02-01T13:05:00.000Z	eleazar123	Stormx2	when i install ubuntu and then reboot grub gives an error (typically Error 22 i think) and then i have to reboot the livecd and figure out why i'm getting that error, and typically after error 22 is fixed i get Error 17 :( it's always after a fresh install of Ubuntu :\
2007-02-01T13:06:00.000Z	Stormx2	eleazar123	Eeek...
2007-02-01T13:06:00.000Z	Stormx2	eleazar123	You got some strange disk setup?
2007-02-01T13:07:00.000Z	eleazar123	Stormx2	not really, all sata, it did it when i had a few ide drives mixed with sata (i always install ubuntu on my sata drives)
2007-02-01T13:07:00.000Z	eleazar123	Stormx2	i guess my main question is how do i figure out which drive i should have the installer install ubuntu onto
2007-02-01T13:09:00.000Z	Stormx2	eleazar123	That sounds like the windows numbering of drives. How many do you have? 3?
2007-02-01T13:10:00.000Z	Stormx2	eleazar123	In the installer just go into "custom" or whatever it is or "manually edit partition table". That'll tell ya.
2007-02-01T13:10:00.000Z	Stormx2	eleazar123	Probably. And please, use partition.
2007-02-01T13:11:00.000Z	Stormx2	eleazar123	Drive is a bit misleading...
2007-02-01T13:12:00.000Z	Stormx2	eleazar123	Are all your drives unpartitioned, etc?
2007-02-01T13:12:00.000Z	eleazar123	Stormx2	no, only the drive i'm trying to install ubuntu onto
2007-02-01T13:13:00.000Z	Stormx2	eleazar123	Well, on the installer, go to "manually edit the partition table". Theres a dropdown list of drives. Find the one you want to install on, make the partions, and voila!
2007-02-01T13:13:00.000Z	Stormx2	eleazar123	Can you wait 20 minutes? I really must eat, I haven't eaten in 24 hours...
