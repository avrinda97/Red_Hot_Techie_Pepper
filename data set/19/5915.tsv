2008-12-24T10:13:00.000Z	mysticdarkhack		Anyone here know a good bandwidth cap monitor that ubuntu can use.
2008-12-24T10:13:00.000Z	mysticdarkhack		tried searching for it on google but no luck
2008-12-24T10:14:00.000Z	stan	mysticdarkhack	mrtg?
2008-12-24T10:14:00.000Z	mysticdarkhack	stan	does it work?
2008-12-24T10:15:00.000Z	stan	mysticdarkhack	what do you mean? its a reporting library.. I use it to track bandwidth usage on > 1k servers .. and millions of others use it on millions of other servers/routers.. waht does 'does it work' mean; exactly?
2008-12-24T10:16:00.000Z	mysticdarkhack	stan	well what about those that don't have a router and will it still work?
2008-12-24T10:17:00.000Z	mysticdarkhack	stan	I probably will get a router soon though since I'm getting a laptop
2008-12-24T10:17:00.000Z	stan	mysticdarkhack	 are you slow or retarded?  I use it to monitor >1k servers, and ~40 routers.
2008-12-24T10:18:00.000Z	mysticdarkhack	stan	no but just didn't get what you are saying. Although I get the idea now and thanks for the help.
2008-12-24T10:19:00.000Z	stan	mysticdarkhack	What are you tryign to do? log your network usage per host?
2008-12-24T10:20:00.000Z	mysticdarkhack	stan	just monitor my cable usage since comcast put a cap to 250gg/mth
2008-12-24T10:21:00.000Z	stan	mysticdarkhack	Download and install 'Cacti' is probably the easiest way.. I think it comes with a network usage report built in.. if not.. its trivial to add one.
2008-12-24T10:22:00.000Z	stan	mysticdarkhack	next buy a route that supports DD-WRT/Open-WRT ... My open-wrt router logs monthly network usage I think.
2008-12-24T10:22:00.000Z	mysticdarkhack	stan	thanks
2008-12-24T10:23:00.000Z	mysticdarkhack	stan	I will do that next month when I order my laptop
2008-12-24T10:24:00.000Z	stan	mysticdarkhack	google 'mrtg iptables' might get you started as well .. or 'mrtg iptables <your isp>' im sure someone else has done it.
2008-12-24T10:24:00.000Z	mysticdarkhack	stan	thank
2008-12-24T10:33:00.000Z	stan	mysticdarkhack	gl with that shitty isp cap
