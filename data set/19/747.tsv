2011-09-16T08:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lendsk009	get a backup if your data is important. The drive motor can and will fail, then no amount of software will save your data and you will be forking out literally THOSANDS of dollars for professional and ungarunteeed data recovery. Contrast that with a couple hundred for a USB drive
2011-09-16T08:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		just every now and again copy the data you want, doesn't need to be complex
2011-09-16T08:55:00.000Z	lendsk009		 ActionParsnip:thanx
2011-09-16T08:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lendsk009	you can use foremost or scalpel in the liveCD environment and you may get the data. It may be that your data has been overwritten, in which case it is GONE. You have learned the value of backups the hardest way possible
