2008-11-17T23:37:00.000Z	Mooch		how do you just install security updates?
2008-11-17T23:38:00.000Z	fde	Mooch	System > Administration > Software Sources ... updates tab... ensure only 'intrepid-security' is checked
2008-11-17T23:39:00.000Z	Mooch	fde	any disadvantages of doing that I mean all those other downloads are they really necessary?
2008-11-17T23:40:00.000Z	fde	Mooch	-updates are bug fixes etc... proposed and backports you don't really need though, they are access to software earlier
2008-11-17T23:42:00.000Z	Mooch	fde	ok so like right now synaptic is saying there are 325 updates available I don't really need all of them except the security fixes right?
2008-11-17T23:43:00.000Z	fde	Mooch	sure
2008-11-17T23:44:00.000Z	Mooch	fde	ok good one more question is it hard to dual boot ubuntu with windows?
2008-11-17T23:45:00.000Z	fde	Mooch	no its not difficult...
2008-11-17T23:46:00.000Z	fde	Mooch	if you install Ubuntu second, it should be automatically set up that way
2008-11-17T23:46:00.000Z	Mooch	fde	give me a crash course I am thinking about doing it but I don't wanna mess up windows
2008-11-17T23:48:00.000Z	Mooch	fde	thought you left for good
2008-11-17T23:49:00.000Z	fde	Mooch	nope, new kernel  :/
2008-11-17T23:49:00.000Z	Mooch	fde	give me a crash course on how to do a dual boot with ubuntu and windows
2008-11-17T23:51:00.000Z	fde	Mooch	throw in the Windows installer, partition giving yourself a decent amount of space for Ubuntu... restart, throw in the Ubuntu cd and install into that space... voila  :/
2008-11-17T23:54:00.000Z	Mooch	fde	how much space do you think I need? Most likely use Ubuntu for paying bills that sort of thing most likely nothing else
2008-11-17T23:59:00.000Z	fde	Mooch	it doesn't effect either OS when both are installed
2008-11-18T00:01:00.000Z	fde	Mooch	just jump right in dude, you're asking very strange questions... its not nearly as scary as you seem to think it is  ;)
2008-11-18T00:02:00.000Z	fde	Mooch	best thing about Ubuntu, it has people like you in mind when its being developed  ;)
2008-11-18T00:07:00.000Z	Mooch	fde	thanks for your help
