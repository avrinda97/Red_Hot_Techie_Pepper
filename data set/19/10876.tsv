2006-09-02T13:18:00.000Z	NullVector		can soemone help me with installing Openoffice.org, I am getting md5sum errors. http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/22348
2006-09-02T13:18:00.000Z	Sivik	NullVector	are you downloading via apt-get or the website?
2006-09-02T13:18:00.000Z	NullVector	Sivik	apt-get
2006-09-02T13:19:00.000Z	NullVector	Sivik	I also attempted to install through teh add/remove programs
2006-09-02T13:19:00.000Z	Sivik	NullVector	do you have the us.archive.com/ubuntu?  if so, get rid of the us in front of it, the stuff from those servers are fubared
2006-09-02T13:19:00.000Z	NullVector	Sivik	looks liek the cd is possibly corrupt, even though I recently did a fresh install off it
2006-09-02T13:20:00.000Z	Sivik	NullVector	you know you can change where it downloads the packages from by editing your /etc/apt/sources.list
2006-09-02T13:20:00.000Z	NullVector	Sivik	will try
2006-09-02T13:20:00.000Z	Sivik	NullVector	comment out the cd, thats what the repos are for
2006-09-02T13:21:00.000Z	Sivik	NullVector	you can also search repo at wiki.ubuntu.com
2006-09-02T13:23:00.000Z	NullVector	Sivik	thanks at least the actual install is starting now. lets hope it finishes
2006-09-02T13:24:00.000Z	Sivik	NullVector	are you installing from the cd or just adding the office stuff?
2006-09-02T13:24:00.000Z	NullVector	Sivik	I commented out the cd in the sources list and I removed the us. in the us.archive/ubuntu
2006-09-02T13:25:00.000Z	Sivik	NullVector	also, uncomment all the other repos there and take out all the us's
2006-09-02T13:25:00.000Z	Sivik	NullVector	that allows for adding of more stuff
2006-09-02T13:25:00.000Z	NullVector	Sivik	I removed all the US's, but didn't comment out anything but the cd's what else should I be commenting out?
2006-09-02T13:26:00.000Z	Sivik	NullVector	no, uncomment the rest of those other repos and remove the #
2006-09-02T13:27:00.000Z	NullVector	Sivik	oh, gotcha, I already did that. and thanks again, OpenOffice is installed now
2006-09-02T13:27:00.000Z	Sivik	NullVector	yw
