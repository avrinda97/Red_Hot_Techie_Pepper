2008-09-10T20:08:00.000Z	ZeroSerenity		Cripes. That was smart by me.
2008-09-10T20:09:00.000Z	ZeroSerenity		-a didn't seem to do anything.
2008-09-10T20:10:00.000Z	ZeroSerenity		Yeah, but it didn't seem different with or without flags.
2008-09-10T20:10:00.000Z	ZeroSerenity		Though, this list is friggin' huge.
2008-09-10T20:11:00.000Z	ZeroSerenity		Yeah. Lines and lines of stuff just blew by.
2008-09-10T20:11:00.000Z	ZeroSerenity		Okay. Next question. How do I set up bash to run bins without being told to with ./?
2008-09-10T20:12:00.000Z	ZeroSerenity		Of course.
2008-09-10T20:12:00.000Z	ZeroSerenity		Give me that -v
2008-09-10T20:12:00.000Z	ZeroSerenity		Or, let me try this:
2008-09-10T20:13:00.000Z	ZeroSerenity		How do I set up bash to run bins without being told to with ./? -v
2008-09-10T20:14:00.000Z	Pici	ZeroSerenity	Are you just trying to run them out of one directory or any?
2008-09-10T20:15:00.000Z	Pici	ZeroSerenity	Is this a program that resides in /home/youruser/ or somewhere else on the system?
2008-09-10T20:17:00.000Z	Pici	ZeroSerenity	I dont reccomend adding ./ to your PATH.  Rather, you should either add the path the executable is in or symlink it into a directory that is already in your path, such as /usr/bin/
2008-09-10T20:18:00.000Z	ZeroSerenity	Pici	-v
2008-09-10T20:18:00.000Z	Pici	ZeroSerenity	What is -v? why do you keep saying that?
2008-09-10T20:23:00.000Z	Pici	ZeroSerenity	Ah, -vv.  Anyway, it means that things that are in the current folder will always be interpreted as commands, I can't think of any situation where this would be wanted.
2008-09-10T20:23:00.000Z	ZeroSerenity	Pici	How do I set that up?
2008-09-10T20:25:00.000Z	Pici	ZeroSerenity	modify your ~/.profile to include: PATH=$PATH:/path/that/exec/is/in
2008-09-10T20:26:00.000Z	Pici	ZeroSerenity	OR: sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/myprog /path/to/myprog
