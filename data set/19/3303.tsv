2011-03-22T17:26:00.000Z	Frots		in $HOME
2011-03-22T17:26:00.000Z	Frots		or /etc/X11
2011-03-22T17:27:00.000Z	Frots		in home it is .xinitrc
2011-03-22T17:27:00.000Z	Frots		for each user IIRC
2011-03-22T17:27:00.000Z	Jinxed-	Frots	does the one in $HOME execute with root privlages?
2011-03-22T17:27:00.000Z	Frots	Jinxed-	no, as user
2011-03-22T17:31:00.000Z	Frots	Jinxed-	if it is a binary
2011-03-22T17:37:00.000Z	Frots	Jinxed-	congrats!
2011-03-22T17:48:00.000Z	Jinxed-	Frots	czardoz Is this the correct way to have something start with startup applications: name: foo Command: sh /path/to/script.sh > /path/to/log 2>&1 Comment:foobar ? because it doesn't appear my script ran as the log file was never created?
2011-03-22T17:48:00.000Z	Frots	Jinxed-	you didnt set suid on sh did you/?
2011-03-22T17:48:00.000Z	Jinxed-	Frots	negitive... just on the program the script calls
2011-03-22T17:49:00.000Z	Frots	Jinxed-	why do you prepend the 'sh' ?
2011-03-22T17:51:00.000Z	Jinxed-	Frots	my script calls the program, and if it shuts down waits 30 seconds and then calls it again etc. So it is just a wrapper on how I want to call it. However the only thing segfaulting was my the actual program binary, which is the ONLY thing I changed the SUID on. I am now able to run my script which calls the program at the user level sucessfully.
2011-03-22T17:51:00.000Z	Jinxed-	Frots	and now I'm trying to get Startup applications to start my script
2011-03-22T17:52:00.000Z	Jinxed-	Frots	the only issue is that Startup Applications doesn't seem to be running, as the log file isn't even being created
2011-03-22T17:54:00.000Z	Frots	Jinxed-	first create it and then chown it to the user
2011-03-22T18:17:00.000Z	Frots	Jinxed-	thats really weird
2011-03-22T18:17:00.000Z	Jinxed-	Frots	It REALLY pains me. but I must agree with you
2011-03-22T18:18:00.000Z	Frots	Jinxed-	goodluck
