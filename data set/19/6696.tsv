2007-12-24T07:05:00.000Z	il12		is there a defragmentation tool in Ubuntu?
2007-12-24T07:05:00.000Z	HardDisk	il12	if your HD is in EXT3 you don't need defragmenters
2007-12-24T07:06:00.000Z	il12	HardDisk	it's an external USB connected HDD...I'm unsure of what EXT3 is
2007-12-24T07:07:00.000Z	il12	HardDisk	yes, so that I can install Kubuntu onto it to try so that I can compare it with Ubuntu, so if I don't like Kubuntu I don't have to redo everything I've done on ubuntu.
2007-12-24T07:09:00.000Z	HardDisk	il12	if you're installing ubuntu/kubuntu on that drive, you do not need to defrag.
2007-12-24T07:11:00.000Z	il12	HardDisk	it's not a clean HD, will that make any difference?
2007-12-24T07:11:00.000Z	HardDisk	il12	no difference.
2007-12-24T07:12:00.000Z	il12	HardDisk	so just burn the .iso to a CD, boot from it, click install and then... it will give me the option to choose which drive I want to install it on then, and it won't make a partition that would delete any of my files?
2007-12-24T07:13:00.000Z	HardDisk	il12	it will ask you if you want to resize to give room
2007-12-24T07:15:00.000Z	HardDisk	il12	just install from the cd, and it will ask you to resize, don't worry about it.
2007-12-24T07:16:00.000Z	il12	HardDisk	so it won't harm any of the files already on that disk?
2007-12-24T07:17:00.000Z	HardDisk	il12	no, during the installation you will have the option to erase, or resize.
2007-12-24T07:17:00.000Z	il12	HardDisk	alright, thank you very much. Is there a recommendation you think I should resize to? it's a 500GB and I've got 300GB+ free left on it.
2007-12-24T07:18:00.000Z	HardDisk	il12	as a start if you don't want to let ubuntu do it for you, you can do this, create for example 20-50 gigs of unallocated space using your favorite partition manager, then let ubuntu use all free space.
2007-12-24T07:19:00.000Z	il12	HardDisk	 ok, I don't mind letting ubuntu do it for me, I let it do it on my laptop which I'm on at the moment, I just didn't know if there was a particular size I should ask it to partition the drive to.
2007-12-24T07:24:00.000Z	il12	HardDisk	because you're a bot, remember? ;)
2007-12-24T07:25:00.000Z	HardDisk	il12	affirmative.
2007-12-24T07:26:00.000Z	il12	HardDisk	dumb question, where does gtweakui install to? as in, under the 'Applications' menu, where is it?
2007-12-24T07:27:00.000Z	il12	HardDisk	ty, as I said, it was a dumb question.
