2012-11-21T07:42:00.000Z	ikonia	webnet	it's not an ubuntu issue, you are using backtrack
2012-11-21T07:43:00.000Z	ikonia	webnet	you where told you had installed an EXTERNAL repo
2012-11-21T07:43:00.000Z	ikonia	webnet	that means it is not software provided by backtrack OR ubuntu

2012-11-21T07:44:00.000Z	webnet	ikonia	no it is a ubuntu issue as LibreOffice is a UBUNTU package
