2007-01-24T17:15:00.000Z	Wrongway		hey all.... I'm having a little trouble mounting a drive..... anyone available?
2007-01-24T17:17:00.000Z	Rookie-1	Wrongway	- sudo mount -t filesystem /device /mountpoint
2007-01-24T17:18:00.000Z	Wrongway	Rookie-1	I've had it mounted, and now I'm trying to unmount it following https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MountingWindowsPartitions#head-a37a1b8aefbfb58f198d678a1d97e70ef26a044c
2007-01-24T17:18:00.000Z	Wrongway		but I get an unmount error
2007-01-24T17:19:00.000Z	Rookie-1	Wrongway	to umount just type sudo umount /mointpoint
2007-01-24T17:19:00.000Z	Wrongway		errr, no. it unmounts, then when I try to remount it using sudo ntfsmount /dev/hdb1 /media/storage -o umask=0007 it gives me an error of:
2007-01-24T17:20:00.000Z	Wrongway		Couldn't mount device '/dev/hdb1': Operation not supported
2007-01-24T17:20:00.000Z	Wrongway		Windows did not shut down properly.  Try to mount volume in windows, shut down and try again.
2007-01-24T17:20:00.000Z	Wrongway		Mount failed.
2007-01-24T17:20:00.000Z	Wrongway		the other drive was used as a spare drive for windows, but I no longer have windows to boot from
2007-01-24T17:21:00.000Z	Rookie-1	Wrongway	- forgot the filesystem ? sudo mount -t ntfs /dev/hda1 /media/storage (should be enough anyway)
2007-01-24T17:22:00.000Z	Rookie-1	Wrongway	- but i dont mount up ntfs, only tempting to write on that one ;) and it will only end up with a mess ;(
2007-01-24T17:22:00.000Z	Wrongway		I'm not entirely sure, but I think that's the command I used when I originally mounted the drive. the problem I had before is it wouldn't give me write access
2007-01-24T17:23:00.000Z	Rookie-1	Wrongway	- you need a thierdparty prog to write to an ntfs partition
2007-01-24T17:23:00.000Z	Rookie-1		!ntfs
2007-01-24T17:23:00.000Z	Rookie-1		!ntfs-3g
2007-01-24T17:24:00.000Z	Rookie-1		!fuse
2007-01-24T17:25:00.000Z	Wrongway		alrighty, I'll check those out. thanks Rookie-1
2007-01-24T17:26:00.000Z	Rookie-1	Wrongway	- if you really need to write between windows and linux, use fat32 instead
