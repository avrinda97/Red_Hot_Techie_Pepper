2011-04-09T06:00:00.000Z	unomystEz		I tried installing Ubuntu 10.10 but I get a [drm] nouveau error saying something like "bit 16 expected = 0 but was 0x011000000" or something or other
2011-04-09T06:00:00.000Z	unomystEz		any ideas?
2011-04-09T06:01:00.000Z	unomystEz		I read it could be related to the fact that I have an nvidia quadro card
2011-04-09T06:01:00.000Z	tmbg	unomystEz	I too have a quadro. I had to switch to the nv or nvidia driver
2011-04-09T06:01:00.000Z	unomystEz	tmbg	well this is during the install... so not sure how to do that
2011-04-09T06:01:00.000Z	tmbg	unomystEz	use the other installer
2011-04-09T06:02:00.000Z	unomystEz	tmbg	how is the nv/nvidia driver compared to the nouveau driver?
2011-04-09T06:02:00.000Z	unomystEz	tmbg	which installer?
2011-04-09T06:02:00.000Z	unomystEz	tmbg	alternate.iso?
2011-04-09T06:02:00.000Z	tmbg	unomystEz	exactly
2011-04-09T06:02:00.000Z	unomystEz	tmbg	okie doke
2011-04-09T06:02:00.000Z	unomystEz	tmbg	hmm, I'll check again.. I only saw some graphical menu
2011-04-09T06:03:00.000Z	unomystEz	tmbg	in the installer that is
2011-04-09T06:03:00.000Z	tmbg	unomystEz	I think the alternate iso has a text only version
2011-04-09T06:04:00.000Z	unomystEz	tmbg	how is the nv/nvidia driver, just as good (hopefully) as the nouveau?
2011-04-09T06:05:00.000Z	tmbg	unomystEz	at least for my card, the nv driver was better.
2011-04-09T06:06:00.000Z	unomystEz	tmbg	can you do lsmod -v | grep n
2011-04-09T06:06:00.000Z	tmbg	unomystEz	the machine with the quadro is at home, I'm at work
2011-04-09T06:06:00.000Z	unomystEz	tmbg	ah
