2005-10-25T11:41:00.000Z	bigfoot2	FlannelKing	 that has only the audio. I'm looking for video
2005-10-25T11:42:00.000Z	FlannelKing	bigfoot2	boggle, what file type?
2005-10-25T11:43:00.000Z	bigfoot2	FlannelKing	what do you mean "what file type"?
2005-10-25T11:43:00.000Z	FlannelKing	bigfoot2	offtopic
2005-10-25T12:41:00.000Z	FlannelKing	bigfoot2	then you wont be able to get it to work in a DVDplayer
2005-10-25T12:41:00.000Z	bigfoot2	FlannelKing	but i burned an mp3 file onto a cd-rom and it works on the dvd-player
2005-10-25T12:41:00.000Z	FlannelKing	bigfoot2	yeah, some DVDplayers read music (and pictures) off of CDs
2005-10-25T12:42:00.000Z	FlannelKing	bigfoot2	some DVDplayers will play VCDs though,
2005-10-25T12:42:00.000Z	bigfoot2	FlannelKing	i have an idea, why don't i burn the file in various formats, just to be sure.
2005-10-25T12:43:00.000Z	FlannelKing	bigfoot2	burning a file to a CD wont necessarily make it work, things have to be set up correctly.
2005-10-25T12:43:00.000Z	bigfoot2	FlannelKing	what things  have to be set up?
2005-10-25T12:43:00.000Z	FlannelKing	bigfoot2	suggest you check with your DVD Player to see if it plays VCDs
2005-10-25T12:43:00.000Z	bigfoot2	FlannelKing	if it does?
2005-10-25T12:44:00.000Z	FlannelKing	bigfoot2	it's like CD players, you can't just burn a wav file to a CD, and have it work in CD players, you need to finalize the CD, etc
