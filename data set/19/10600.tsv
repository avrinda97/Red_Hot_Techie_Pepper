2007-05-19T06:19:00.000Z	Pelo	ubuntu-rocks	 install on the other comp ( it's only 30 min anyway ) then just copy over your home folder
2007-05-19T06:21:00.000Z	Pelo	ubuntu-rocks	 you can make a simple  bash script with  apt-get install for that
2007-05-19T06:22:00.000Z	Pelo	ubuntu-rocks	 if you insist on cloning   manpage   dd
2007-05-19T06:23:00.000Z	Pelo	ubuntu-rocks	basicaly you can script any proceedure you had to do with the terminal
2007-05-19T06:25:00.000Z	Pelo	ubuntu-rocks	 much of the basic progs are on the cd to begin with , and donT' have to be downloaded
2007-05-19T06:26:00.000Z	Pelo	ubuntu-rocks	 just run a update after putting the cd in so it notices the packages are there ,  there are even more on the dvd , saves a lot of bandwith
2007-05-19T06:27:00.000Z	Pelo	ubuntu-rocks	 basicaly the cd is being used as a nother repos,  and apt will just used the latest version ofhte package it can find,  if it is on the cd it will use that one first
2007-05-19T06:28:00.000Z	Pelo	ubuntu-rocks	 same as the cd it's jsut the dvd instead,  it has everyting on it,  live,  alternate, server, ,  sudo apt-get update
2007-05-19T08:36:00.000Z	Pelo	ubuntu-rocks	 sudo apt-get update then  run the install command again
2007-05-19T08:37:00.000Z	Pelo	ubuntu-rocks	 sudo then
2007-05-19T08:37:00.000Z	Pelo	ubuntu-rocks	do not edit your sources list , you donT' need to  just update
2007-05-19T08:40:00.000Z	Pelo	ubuntu-rocks	 I know there have been issues with SATA HDD but I haven'T expericed it myself and I have two WDC hdd one sata one IDe
2007-05-19T08:46:00.000Z	Pelo	ubuntu-rocks	 probably a manpage
2007-05-19T08:48:00.000Z	Pelo	ubuntu-rocks	 I donT' know, try locate apache
2007-05-21T07:56:00.000Z	Pelo	ubuntu-rocks	I've asked and never got an answer
2007-05-21T07:58:00.000Z	Pelo	ubuntu-rocks	just use the app's name
2007-05-21T07:58:00.000Z	Pelo	ubuntu-rocks	 kill $(pgrep -f  appname)
