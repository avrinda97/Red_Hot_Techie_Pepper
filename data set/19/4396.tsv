2012-10-15T12:26:00.000Z	chronofusion1980		tried steps on http://superuser.com/questions/342107/getting-macro-keys-from-a-razer-blackwidow-to-work-on-linux when try " cabal configure"  i get " package not found...create the package"
2012-10-15T12:27:00.000Z	chronofusion1980		and yes I have..no one  knows any ppa, installer package, cabal, python package work arounds to get it working
2012-10-15T12:27:00.000Z	chronofusion1980		I just typed in those steps in terminal..hell i dont know.. Ubuntu noob here
2012-10-15T12:28:00.000Z	chronofusion1980		I have no clue how to create a package
2012-10-15T12:29:00.000Z	chronofusion1980		here's the difference..windows just works  LInux requires severe manual tweaking.  and I wasn't being rude.  I didn't realize that here when you ask a quesiton that no one knows the answer to..you get ignored  instead of " sorry not sure" by anyone
2012-10-15T12:30:00.000Z	chronofusion1980		anyways..I tried that url gordon  already have the python-usb packages via synaptic package manager install, but not sure what to do next
2012-10-15T12:31:00.000Z	chronofusion1980		ok did that..when i run it my text editor opens it up with a ton of info
2012-10-15T12:32:00.000Z	chronofusion1980		?? so i type that in terminal?
2012-10-15T12:34:00.000Z	chronofusion1980		because Monkeydust..windows is a hell of a lot easy to deal with.lol.  but I seriously want to replace windows with this distro...getting the m keys to work and gaming.will complete that..LOVE handbrake-gtk
2012-10-15T12:34:00.000Z	chronofusion1980		yes.they do..just like learning how to ride a bike..then learning how to drive a motorcycle
2012-10-15T12:35:00.000Z	gartral	chronofusion1980	obscure gaming hardware can be a PiTA to get working, and usually there's less that 100 people who have a similar setup, maybe 10-15 of those have a god grasp on how to make it work, I myself am tackling getting a driver together for use with the Razer Lachesis mouse to set it's profiles without a windows installation
2012-10-15T12:36:00.000Z	gartral	chronofusion1980	try this: python ./Downloads/blackwidow_enable.py
2012-10-15T12:38:00.000Z	gartral	chronofusion1980	open a terminal and run python ~/Downloads/blackwidow_enable.py
2012-10-15T12:46:00.000Z	gartral	chronofusion1980	to make this a little easier, open up your terminal and run sudo apt-get install pastebinit
2012-10-15T12:47:00.000Z	gartral	chronofusion1980	you're wrong about Wine. As the Synapse application is actually a driver wrapper it won't detect the keyboard and will report "No Device"
2012-10-15T12:48:00.000Z	gartral	chronofusion1980	make that sudo lshw | pastebinit
2012-10-15T12:59:00.000Z	gartral	chronofusion1980	try python ~/Downloads/blackwidow_enable.py
2012-10-15T13:20:00.000Z	gartral	chronofusion1980	it's specifically for the Copperhead mouse
2012-10-15T13:22:00.000Z	gartral	chronofusion1980	well.. it hasn't been updated since '07.. but I'm looking at patching it for use with the Lachesis, and possibly other mice if I can collect the magic strings for all the function
