2009-12-05T14:48:00.000Z	kaduk		Hi
2009-12-05T14:48:00.000Z	kaduk		I removed virus called pulseaudio
2009-12-05T14:48:00.000Z	kaduk		but I dont have volume slider now:(
2009-12-05T14:48:00.000Z	kaduk		how to enable volume slider in gnome-panel with alsa only?
2009-12-05T14:48:00.000Z	kaduk		it should be possible
2009-12-05T14:49:00.000Z	ardchoille	kaduk	I don't think that was a virus
2009-12-05T14:49:00.000Z	kaduk	ardchoille	was not?
2009-12-05T14:49:00.000Z	kaduk	ardchoille	ok.. but I did not like it, can I somehow use just simple alsa with Ubuntu ?
2009-12-05T14:49:00.000Z	ardchoille	kaduk	no idea, I don't use sound
2009-12-05T15:06:00.000Z	ardchoille	kaduk	if I were you I'd try: sudo apt-get instal pulseaudio
2009-12-05T15:06:00.000Z	kaduk	ardchoille	PA is broken
2009-12-05T15:06:00.000Z	kaduk	ardchoille	I dont want to use it
2009-12-05T15:06:00.000Z	ardchoille	kaduk	ok
2009-12-05T15:06:00.000Z	kaduk	ardchoille	it worked before on previous ubuntu versions without this
2009-12-05T15:07:00.000Z	kaduk	ardchoille	so its serious regression
2009-12-05T15:08:00.000Z	kaduk	ardchoille	this is pretty common issue that people are removing buggy software like pulseaudio
2009-12-05T15:08:00.000Z	kaduk	ardchoille	http://www.kdenlive.org/forum/remember-remove-pulseaudio-if-using-kubuntu-karmic
2009-12-05T15:09:00.000Z	ardchoille	kaduk	I understand
2009-12-05T15:09:00.000Z	kaduk	ardchoille	similar problem to mine, I also experience sound problems
