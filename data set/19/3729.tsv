2009-08-19T06:38:00.000Z	edbian	kermit	"metacity --replace&"
2009-08-19T06:38:00.000Z	kermit	edbian	thanks!
2009-08-19T06:39:00.000Z	edbian	kermit	NP
2009-08-19T06:39:00.000Z	edbian	kermit	If it worked then they should return normally after you reboot
2009-08-19T06:41:00.000Z	kermit	edbian	hmm it seems i cant get metacity running with compiz now.. before either both were running, or compiz at least had window management
2009-08-19T06:41:00.000Z	edbian	kermit	compiz should be calling metacity
2009-08-19T06:41:00.000Z	edbian	kermit	They can run both at once
2009-08-19T06:41:00.000Z	edbian	kermit	Do you have ccsm installed?
2009-08-19T06:42:00.000Z	kermit	edbian	a what?
2009-08-19T06:42:00.000Z	kermit	edbian	yes
2009-08-19T06:42:00.000Z	edbian	kermit	Look at the "window borders" plugin
2009-08-19T06:43:00.000Z	kermit	edbian	i dont see that plugin
2009-08-19T06:43:00.000Z	edbian	kermit	Should be in there...
2009-08-19T06:43:00.000Z	kermit	edbian	window decoration?
2009-08-19T06:44:00.000Z	kermit	edbian	window decoration did it, thanks again!
