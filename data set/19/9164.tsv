2006-12-17T08:50:00.000Z	lafielle		Hi, how do I get a program to autostart?
2006-12-17T08:50:00.000Z	lafielle		preferably without having to resort to the commandline.
2006-12-17T08:50:00.000Z	lafielle		cheers!
2006-12-17T08:50:00.000Z	frogzoo	lafielle	sys -> prefs -> session
2006-12-17T08:53:00.000Z	frogzoo	lafielle	well, some people prefer raw iptables
2006-12-17T08:54:00.000Z	lafielle	frogzoo	well, for the layman :)
2006-12-17T08:55:00.000Z	frogzoo	lafielle	you could do much worse - firestarter is fine
2006-12-17T08:59:00.000Z	lafielle	frogzoo	thanks.
2006-12-17T09:00:00.000Z	frogzoo	lafielle	nope - just click the box that says autostart
2006-12-17T09:01:00.000Z	lafielle	frogzoo	in firestarter or in the session manager?
2006-12-17T09:01:00.000Z	lafielle	frogzoo	clicking add leads to a browse button.
2006-12-17T09:02:00.000Z	frogzoo	lafielle	it's in firestarters options - to autostart (but it will start iptables at boot, even when the gui's not showing)
2006-12-17T09:02:00.000Z	lafielle	frogzoo	ah, I'll have another look. Thanks.
2006-12-17T09:03:00.000Z	lafielle	frogzoo	firestarter options has a 'start firewall on program start up'; nothing related to 'system startup' from what I can see.
2006-12-17T09:04:00.000Z	frogzoo	lafielle	that will do fine  - that's just to create the icon in gnome
2006-12-17T09:06:00.000Z	lafielle	frogzoo	hmm, so I don't actually need firestarter to be running for preexisting rules to be enabled?
2006-12-17T09:06:00.000Z	lafielle	frogzoo	in other words, I only need firestarter to change rules (not to actually run the firewall)
2006-12-17T09:06:00.000Z	frogzoo	lafielle	the way to check is, without logging into gnome, from a terminal try 'sudo iptables -v' & you'll see a bunch of rules if the firewall is working
2006-12-17T09:07:00.000Z	lafielle	frogzoo	ok, thanks.
