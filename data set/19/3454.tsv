2010-01-24T07:55:00.000Z	deena		Hi anyone can explain how nat works
2010-01-24T07:55:00.000Z	deena		see i installed virutal box and running opensolaris inside it..
2010-01-24T07:57:00.000Z	deena		when i check ip it is taking it is taking 10.x series
2010-01-24T07:57:00.000Z	deena		but my main pc is working 192.x. series
2010-01-24T07:57:00.000Z	deena		how it works
2010-01-24T07:59:00.000Z	bankix	deena	You're using NAT in VirtualBox.
2010-01-24T08:00:00.000Z	bankix	deena	So your guest system gets 10.0.2.3 for default
2010-01-24T08:00:00.000Z	bankix	deena	And the VirtualBox is doing the translation. You can reach your serving system on IP 10.0.2.2
2010-01-24T08:01:00.000Z	bankix	deena	VirtualBox acts as a normal router does, the only difference is that your gateway is 10.0.2.2 and not .2.1 as usual.
2010-01-24T08:01:00.000Z	bankix	deena	So if you want to log into your host system, you do a ssh to 10.0.2.2.
2010-01-24T08:02:00.000Z	bankix	deena	deena: from inside of your guest system, of course
2010-01-24T08:03:00.000Z	bankix	deena	Yes, you can't reach your guest system from outside of VirtualBox because of the NAT.
2010-01-24T08:03:00.000Z	bankix	deena	VirtualBox does not set up a corresponding network device with the host's IP 10.0.2.2, it's some kind of "embedded" networking device
2010-01-24T08:04:00.000Z	bankix	deena	In fact, VirtualBox just seeds the packages directly into the networking layer.
2010-01-24T08:04:00.000Z	bankix	deena	So you can't ping, ssh or what ever your guest from outside of virtual box when using NAT
2010-01-24T08:04:00.000Z	bankix	deena	If you need access to your guest system, you'll have to use bridging instead of NAT.
2010-01-24T08:05:00.000Z	bankix	deena	Then your network card acts like a network switch and you connect both, your host system and your guest, to this switch -- both getting one exclusive IP through DHCP.
2010-01-24T08:06:00.000Z	bankix	deena	No, using a different IP address for you guest won't help anything. If you need to connect to your guest system, your only chance is setting up network-bridging.
