2008-06-20T03:10:00.000Z	Prose		is there a way to test my fileserver's speed on the LAN Network ?
2008-06-20T03:11:00.000Z	Prose		!ask
2008-06-20T03:11:00.000Z	Slart	Prose	there is a benchmark for ethernet connection..
2008-06-20T03:12:00.000Z	Slart	Prose	iperf, I think it's called.. but it won't benchmark your file server.. just the connection
2008-09-18T23:57:00.000Z	Slart	Prose	what do you mean by "stop" ? you can ask it to quit nicely
2008-09-18T23:57:00.000Z	Prose	Slart	well, throug init.d it doesn't work
2008-09-18T23:58:00.000Z	Slart	Prose	doesn't work? do you get some kind of error message?
2008-09-18T23:58:00.000Z	Slart	Prose	then it isn't running
2008-09-18T23:58:00.000Z	Prose	Slart	but when I ps aux it's clearly running
2008-09-18T23:58:00.000Z	Slart	Prose	so no need to stop it
2008-09-19T00:00:00.000Z	Slart	Prose	that stop command doesn't just kill every process with a certain name.. it kills the process it started earlier.. so if you've run the vsftp program yourself it won't kill it for you.. afaik
2008-09-19T00:00:00.000Z	Slart	Prose	but try killing that stray vsftp process using kill, pkill or whatever method you like..
2008-09-19T00:00:00.000Z	Prose	Slart	hum okay, but init.d won't kill processed it started himself
2008-09-19T00:01:00.000Z	Slart	Prose	it starts a process and saves the pID in a file.. when you stop it it kills the process with the pID from the file.. if I understand things correctly
2008-09-19T00:01:00.000Z	Slart	Prose	so if you start vsftp by running it from a terminal you can't kill it using init.d
2008-09-19T00:02:00.000Z	Prose	Slart	ok it works now
2008-09-19T00:02:00.000Z	Prose	Slart	.... oh damn I see what happened!
2008-09-19T00:04:00.000Z	Slart	Prose	ah..tricky
2008-09-19T00:04:00.000Z	Prose	Slart	yeah it reminds me of when I used Windows :(
