2011-07-26T17:10:00.000Z	dasdsdsa		Its about Unitz
2011-07-26T17:10:00.000Z	dasdsdsa		Unity
2011-07-26T17:11:00.000Z	dasdsdsa		Well Unity 3 D uses Compiy
2011-07-26T17:11:00.000Z	dasdsdsa		and Compiz has got a Desktop Wall
2011-07-26T17:11:00.000Z	dasdsdsa		And if i move a window to the edge and then try to maximise
2011-07-26T17:12:00.000Z	dasdsdsa		It maximise where the window is most port on it
2011-07-26T17:12:00.000Z	dasdsdsa		no swap destinydriven
2011-07-26T17:13:00.000Z	dasdsdsa		And if i move a window to the edge and then try to maximise
2011-07-26T17:13:00.000Z	dasdsdsa		It maximise where the window is most port on it
2011-07-26T17:13:00.000Z	dr_willis	dasdsdsa	 it maxamizes to the monitor contatning the largest % of the window...   thats how it normally works here...
2011-07-26T17:14:00.000Z	dasdsdsa	dr_willis	how to stop
2011-07-26T17:14:00.000Z	dr_willis	dasdsdsa	 thats how it has worked for years..  what are you expecting it to do exactly? its a feature of twinview i thought. Not compiz.
2011-07-26T17:15:00.000Z	dr_willis	dasdsdsa	 thats exactly how  i want it to work normally.
2011-07-26T17:15:00.000Z	dasdsdsa	dr_willis	yes but earlier it was not bad because there were only horizontal
2011-07-26T17:15:00.000Z	dasdsdsa	dr_willis	now in unity there are vertical too
2011-07-26T17:16:00.000Z	dasdsdsa	dr_willis	in unity there are two rows
2011-07-26T17:17:00.000Z	dasdsdsa	dr_willis	earlier in ubuntu 10.10 it was so too but only if i moved the window right or left
2011-07-26T17:17:00.000Z	dasdsdsa	dr_willis	now it is top and bottom too
