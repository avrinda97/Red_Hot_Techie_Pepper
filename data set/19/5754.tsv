2008-11-02T13:20:00.000Z	_2		ok.  i'm declaring that while tar is a file format it's also a filesystem.  poc @ http://ubuntu.pastebin.us/12192
2008-11-02T13:21:00.000Z	djhash	_2	its not a filesystem. its a file system.. two different things
2008-11-02T13:21:00.000Z	_2	djhash	view the link
2008-11-02T13:23:00.000Z	djhash	_2	i did.. its not a filesystem... its just writing the 0s and 1s to the disk.. you dont need a filesystem to write 0s and 1s to a floppy disk.. you will not see it as a file on the disk..
2008-11-02T13:24:00.000Z	_2	djhash	i can browse the disk with mc
2008-11-02T13:26:00.000Z	_2	djhash	while mc doesn't support some of the more common functions it does support viewing and editing of files (doesn't save)  copy files from (but not to) cd up and down the dirrectory tree....   what is the differance in that and a file system i would like to know....      and the limitations are in the mc program not in tar itself.
2008-11-02T13:27:00.000Z	djhash	_2	read the highlighted part... http://ubuntu.pastebin.us/12193     mc is capable of figuring out that a tar file was written to it without a filesystem
2008-11-02T13:29:00.000Z	_2	djhash	but i don't have to use mc.   tar can add and remove files   even list and read them.   that's all any filesystem does.   the only thing missing is tar support in the kernel or it would mount.
2008-11-02T13:29:00.000Z	djhash	_2	simply put.. its a virtual filesystem if you want to be technical about it.. but its different from filesystem
2008-11-02T13:30:00.000Z	djhash	_2	ofcourse tar can do it.. tar doesnt care about filesystems.. it just reads whats there..
2008-11-02T13:30:00.000Z	djhash	_2	you can dd if:/dev/fd0 of:~/tarfile.tar
2008-11-02T13:31:00.000Z	_2	djhash	what highlighted portion ?
2008-11-02T13:32:00.000Z	djhash	_2	scroll to line 147.. it should be highlited in yellow.. http://ubuntu.pastebin.us/12193
2008-11-02T13:32:00.000Z	_2	djhash	yes you can dd it to a file you can do that with /dev/hda1 as well...
2008-11-02T13:33:00.000Z	_2	djhash	no highlighting but yeah i wrote that.   what are you trying to say about it.
2008-11-02T13:33:00.000Z	_2		?
2008-11-02T13:34:00.000Z	_2	djhash	are you implying that my words in a pastebin are more trustworthy than my words in an irc channel ???    just what are you saying ?
2008-11-02T13:40:00.000Z	djhash	_2	no.. i didn't know the you wrote it so thats a moot argument.. anyways.. I just looked up definition of filesystem.. and I guess you can call it a filesystem..
2008-11-02T13:40:00.000Z	_2	djhash	that's the conclusion i came to. also.
