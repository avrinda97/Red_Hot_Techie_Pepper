2007-11-17T00:54:00.000Z	daedra		should be installed be default really
2007-11-17T00:55:00.000Z	daedra		#sudo su
2007-11-17T00:55:00.000Z	nickrud	daedra	sudo -i is more elegant
2008-03-30T04:48:00.000Z	nickrud	daedra	ctl-c
2008-03-30T04:48:00.000Z	daedra	nickrud	no
2008-03-30T04:48:00.000Z	nickrud	daedra	then you'll have to close it
2008-03-30T04:48:00.000Z	nickrud	daedra	or type reset , blindly if you have command line
2008-04-09T04:43:00.000Z	nickrud	daedra	crossover between, and set up forwarding on the one directly connected (firestarter can do that for you)
2008-04-09T04:44:00.000Z	daedra	nickrud	is firestarter a front end for iptables/netfilter
2008-04-09T04:51:00.000Z	daedra	nickrud	it doesn't mount writeable
2008-04-09T04:44:00.000Z	nickrud	daedra	yes
2008-04-09T04:45:00.000Z	daedra	nickrud	wow - that is so much simpler than ubuntu!
2008-04-09T04:46:00.000Z	daedra	nickrud	I mean *windows
2008-04-09T04:47:00.000Z	daedra	nickrud	is there a simplified mounting application in ubuntu? I'm dealing with ntfs
2008-04-09T04:50:00.000Z	nickrud	daedra	no, but doubleclicking the device in the filemanager will mount it
2008-04-09T04:54:00.000Z	nickrud	daedra	then you will need to set up /etc/fstab,  something like:   UUID=<see blkid for uuid of device> /media/<device> ntfs defaults,umask=007,gid=46 0 1  . device is the /dev/<device>
2008-04-09T04:59:00.000Z	daedra	nickrud	the problem is it gets mounted in /media because its a usb plugged in NTFS
