2008-02-12T19:38:00.000Z	Dex-Freudii		what's the purpose of cpu frequency scaling?
2008-02-12T19:39:00.000Z	Slart	Dex-Freudii	to save power by underclocking the cpu when you're not using it
2008-02-12T19:39:00.000Z	Dex-Freudii	Slart	doen't it slow down the performance?
2008-02-12T19:39:00.000Z	Slart	Dex-Freudii	so if I leave my computer on over the night it becomes a 1.2 GHz Amd instead of a 2.4 GHz amd =)
2008-02-12T19:40:00.000Z	Slart	Dex-Freudii	yes.. that's the whole point
2008-02-12T19:40:00.000Z	Slart	Dex-Freudii	but it clocks it right up when you need it to.. so it's only slower when the computer isn't doing anything
2008-02-12T19:40:00.000Z	Dex-Freudii	Slart	the thing is that I'm now using XChat and the cpu freq monitor says 800 MHz instead of 1.8 GHz
2008-02-12T19:41:00.000Z	Dex-Freudii	Slart	why is that?
2008-02-12T19:41:00.000Z	Slart	Dex-Freudii	yes.. and what is your computer doing 99.9% of the time? waiting for you to hit another key.. do you want it to wait faster? sure.. disable the frequency thingy =)
2008-02-12T19:42:00.000Z	Slart	Dex-Freudii	it won't do you much good.. and it will use more electricity.. and get warmer
2008-02-12T19:42:00.000Z	Dex-Freudii	Slart	I see... thank you
2008-02-12T19:45:00.000Z	Slart	Dex-Freudii	the kernel can have stuff compiled in.. that is always enabled.. taking space etc.. then there's modules. those are loaded when they are needed... I don't think the kernel loads modules it doesn't need.. you can see a list of loaded modules with "lsmod"
2008-02-12T19:45:00.000Z	Dex-Freudii	Slart	 so I mean then the compiled stuff
2008-02-12T19:46:00.000Z	Dex-Freudii	Slart	should I recompile? how?
2008-02-12T19:46:00.000Z	Slart	Dex-Freudii	what kind of computer are you running? old? slow? small?
2008-02-12T19:48:00.000Z	Slart	Dex-Freudii	honestly.. I think I'd have a hard time seeing any difference if I recompiled my kernel.. I think it's more work than it's worth
2008-02-12T19:49:00.000Z	Dex-Freudii	Slart	any idea where to get docs or howtos about that?
2008-02-12T19:49:00.000Z	Slart	Dex-Freudii	check the forums.. or the wiki.. or kernel.org, in that order
2008-02-12T19:49:00.000Z	Dex-Freudii	Slart	thnx
