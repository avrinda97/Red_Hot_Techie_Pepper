2011-02-27T04:11:00.000Z	raido	tuzlo	they are all hard to use, that is as an admin
2011-02-27T04:11:00.000Z	raido	tuzlo	drupal is by for more widely used
2011-02-27T04:12:00.000Z	raido	tuzlo	Yeah Wordpress is nice but  a lightweight on fetures
2011-02-27T04:46:00.000Z	raido	tuzlo	vi sudoers
2011-02-27T04:46:00.000Z	raido	tuzlo	scratch that
2011-02-27T04:47:00.000Z	raido	tuzlo	visudo as root
2011-02-27T04:50:00.000Z	raido	tuzlo	what did you do to remove your user from sudo, that doesnt happen on its own?
2011-02-27T04:51:00.000Z	raido	tuzlo	where does it say that
2011-02-27T04:53:00.000Z	raido	tuzlo	is tuzlo the only user you set up on the system
2011-02-27T04:55:00.000Z	raido	tuzlo	you will need to boot into single user mode and fix it by adding your user back to the admin group. Still curious how you did this
2011-02-27T04:59:00.000Z	raido	tuzlo	reboot into recovery mode, that will give you a root prompt, run this command "adduser tuzlo admin", then run "passwd" and choose a password for the root user. Then you can later login as root if you want.
2011-02-27T05:32:00.000Z	raido	tuzlo	do you have the install cd
