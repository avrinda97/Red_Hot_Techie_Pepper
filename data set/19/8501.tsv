2007-07-07T12:19:00.000Z	fivetwentysix		It doesn't say Native.
2007-07-07T12:19:00.000Z	fivetwentysix		It doesn't even give a log file
2007-07-07T12:20:00.000Z	fivetwentysix		I was told my distro was broken.
2007-07-07T12:20:00.000Z	fivetwentysix		How can I check if my distro is broken?
2007-07-07T12:20:00.000Z	PurpZeY	fivetwentysix	What do you mean by that?
2007-07-07T12:21:00.000Z	fivetwentysix		i dunno
2007-07-07T12:21:00.000Z	fivetwentysix		that's what i was told
2007-07-07T12:21:00.000Z	fivetwentysix		They said my distro build was broken
2007-07-07T12:21:00.000Z	PurpZeY	fivetwentysix	What problem are you having?
2007-07-07T12:21:00.000Z	PurpZeY		Who is they?
2007-07-07T12:21:00.000Z	fivetwentysix		Azureus is crashing for no apparent reasons
2007-07-07T12:21:00.000Z	fivetwentysix		And the crashes appear random
2007-07-07T12:21:00.000Z	fivetwentysix		And i can't start azureus till i delete the .azureus directory after a crash
2007-07-07T12:21:00.000Z	PurpZeY	fivetwentysix	Did you download azureus from the repos?
2007-07-07T12:21:00.000Z	fivetwentysix		Yes.
2007-07-07T12:21:00.000Z	PurpZeY	fivetwentysix	It is notoriously unstable. Get it from sourceforge
2007-07-07T12:22:00.000Z	PurpZeY		!font | titun
2007-07-07T12:22:00.000Z	fivetwentysix	PurpZeY	could it be my JRE ?
2007-07-07T12:23:00.000Z	PurpZeY	fivetwentysix	It could but, I am telling you...The version in the repos is known to be unstable. Get Azereus from sourceforge and that should alleviate the issue
