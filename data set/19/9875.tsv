2006-09-03T10:04:00.000Z	baconbacon	glassbits	im sending you a script to backup/restore apt cache
2006-09-03T10:05:00.000Z	glassbits	baconbacon	thanks mate! :)
2006-09-03T10:06:00.000Z	baconbacon	glassbits	it will overwrite apt config, so you restore the sources.list too
2006-09-03T10:07:00.000Z	glassbits	baconbacon	if it overwrites apt config. what will be the consequences
2006-09-03T10:10:00.000Z	glassbits	baconbacon	if it overwrites apt config what will happen ?
2006-09-03T10:11:00.000Z	baconbacon	glassbits	you lose you sources.list
2006-09-03T10:12:00.000Z	glassbits	baconbacon	so i will just have to backup my sources.list
2006-09-03T10:14:00.000Z	baconbacon	glassbits	usually youd want to use the backuped(sp) one
2006-09-03T10:15:00.000Z	baconbacon	glassbits	i was just saying if you have customized sources.list the backup one will replace
2006-09-03T10:15:00.000Z	glassbits	baconbacon	ohh!
2006-09-03T10:17:00.000Z	glassbits	baconbacon	are you writing the script yourself ?
2006-09-03T10:18:00.000Z	baconbacon	glassbits	i took it somewhere but used it many times
2006-09-03T10:19:00.000Z	glassbits	baconbacon	can you just outline your process so that i can manually do that ?
2006-09-03T10:20:00.000Z	baconbacon	glassbits	i execute the first line on the source computer. I transfer the apt.tgz to the other computer. i execute the second line on it. I apt-get update then upgrade
2006-09-03T10:21:00.000Z	glassbits	baconbacon	so basically it just copies all those new files and updates the system using apt-get dist-upgrade
2006-09-03T10:22:00.000Z	baconbacon	glassbits	no it's is just two commands.  you run the first one on the 1st comp and the second... just read the file.
2006-09-03T10:23:00.000Z	glassbits	baconbacon	thts what the script does, i am talking about what the script actually does
