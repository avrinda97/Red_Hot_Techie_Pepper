2011-04-02T07:25:00.000Z	truepurple_		Does having IPv6 off cause any trouble ever?
2011-04-02T07:27:00.000Z	ohsix	truepurple_	did you file a bug?
2011-04-02T07:28:00.000Z	truepurple_	ohsix	Not sure if you would call it a bug, but my browser stopped being able to call up internet, it required me disabling IPv6 to get it to work again
2011-04-02T07:30:00.000Z	ohsix	truepurple_	ah, that's pretty well known
2011-04-02T07:31:00.000Z	ohsix	truepurple_	other things being broken make it a problem though :\
2011-04-02T07:31:00.000Z	truepurple_	ohsix	Well I have been asking on ubuntu forum, ubuntu chat, and firefox chat, as well as searching online, for hours, and noone thought to suggest that
2011-04-02T07:31:00.000Z	ohsix	truepurple_	forums :D
2011-04-02T07:32:00.000Z	truepurple_	ohsix	Someone spend quite some time trying to help me by suggesting different things, and that was not one of them
2011-04-02T07:32:00.000Z	truepurple_	ohsix	What about forums?
2011-04-02T07:32:00.000Z	ohsix	truepurple_	you might as well have asked your grandmother to speculate about what might be wrong
2011-04-02T07:33:00.000Z	truepurple_	ohsix	Where would you suggest I go for help then?
2011-04-02T07:37:00.000Z	ohsix	truepurple_	dunno, for one offs smart friends help, best you can do is support yourself and get an idea about how to do differential diagnosis and rule stuff out
2011-04-02T07:39:00.000Z	truepurple_	ohsix	 I only partially understood that
2011-04-02T07:40:00.000Z	ohsix	truepurple_	your problem was a very narrow one that could be easily checked against dns problems and a networking problem, someone who knew of the problem already would have you paste the output of ifconfig, to see if theres any ipv6 stuff attached to the interface, then see if ipv6 worked, ping6 or something
2011-04-02T07:44:00.000Z	truepurple_	ohsix	I didn't know what kind of problem it was, I don't know how you mean to "check against something. And I had trouble understanding some of that
2011-04-02T13:10:00.000Z	ohsix	truepurple_	about:plugins, or adobes version checker
2011-04-02T13:12:00.000Z	truepurple_	ohsix	Shockwave Flash 10.2 r153, that the latest experimental one?
2011-04-02T13:13:00.000Z	ohsix	truepurple_	no idea
2011-04-02T13:20:00.000Z	truepurple_	ohsix	How do I check if I have autoupdate of ubuntu on?
