2006-06-14T16:07:00.000Z	Gullstad	Hobbsee	Listed in !wireless?
2006-06-14T16:08:00.000Z	Hobbsee	Gullstad	is it listed in that first link?
2006-06-14T16:09:00.000Z	Gullstad	Hobbsee	First topiclink?
2006-06-14T16:10:00.000Z	Hobbsee	Gullstad	yes, in https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsWirelessNetworkCards
2006-06-14T16:11:00.000Z	Hobbsee	Gullstad	if you could pastebin lspci, that would be helpful
2006-06-14T16:11:00.000Z	Gullstad	Hobbsee	I'll check, thanks.
2006-06-14T16:11:00.000Z	Gullstad	Hobbsee	That could be a problem, considering that the computer is not online.
2006-06-14T16:12:00.000Z	Hobbsee	Gullstad	okay, you can just run the command, and then tell me what it says - maybe something on the line of ethernet controller: blah blah blah or something
2006-06-14T16:14:00.000Z	Gullstad	Hobbsee	Apperently Ubuntu dont support any CNet drivers, eaven though is the RaLink chipset
2006-06-14T16:14:00.000Z	Hobbsee	Gullstad	which ralink chipset?  and just because a card isnt listed there, it doesnt mean it's not supported - it means it hasnt been tested
2006-06-14T16:18:00.000Z	Hobbsee	Gullstad	if that's the case, and lspci shows it as a ralink rt2500 chipset, then see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WifiDocs/RalinkRT2500
2006-06-14T16:18:00.000Z	Gullstad	Hobbsee	lspci shows whitch chipset cards are using?
2006-06-14T16:18:00.000Z	Hobbsee	Gullstad	yes
2006-06-14T16:19:00.000Z	Gullstad	Hobbsee	I'll look into it. You probly will get me back here whining in a while.
2006-06-14T16:22:00.000Z	Gullstad	Hobbsee	RT2400 / RT2460
2006-06-14T16:24:00.000Z	Hobbsee	Gullstad	check google - it seems to have some info on that chipset
2006-06-14T16:25:00.000Z	Gullstad	Hobbsee	I'll try the Ubuntu.Wiki =)
