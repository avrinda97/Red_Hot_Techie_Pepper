2008-04-11T16:32:00.000Z	Pici	DJones	And the replacement for nvu ;)
2008-04-11T16:34:00.000Z	DJones	Pici	yep, I knew that, that was going to be my next comment
2008-04-14T18:39:00.000Z	DJones	Pici	Do you mind a quick pm about a factoid?
2008-04-14T18:39:00.000Z	Pici	DJones	I don't, but you could always just suggest it to the bot if you wish.
2008-05-13T22:45:00.000Z	Pici	DJones	thanks anyway ;)
2009-01-12T23:25:00.000Z	DJones	Pici	Just for info, the brokenmsn factiod doesn't need a new account creating, just the orginal one changing from MSN to WLM, I've just done that myself, whether its a case of working for everyone is another matter though, so I guess the factoid is probably better as it stands
2009-01-12T23:25:00.000Z	Pici	DJones	noted
2009-03-16T19:31:00.000Z	DJones	Pici	Is that russian? whois suggests a .ua host
2009-03-25T18:33:00.000Z	DJones	Pici	I'm sure everybody would rather have a short spell of mode spam than the user spam/trolling
2009-05-06T18:09:00.000Z	DJones	Pici	Can I message you
2009-05-06T18:10:00.000Z	Pici	DJones	sure
2009-07-01T18:52:00.000Z	DJones	Pici	This is probably what indus was referring to re the firefox name change https://developer.mozilla.org/devnews/index.php/2009/03/06/shiretoko-to-be-named-firefox-35/
2009-09-30T17:36:00.000Z	DJones	Pici	Sorry, forgot to add the Electronlibre  name to that op.ps call
2009-09-30T17:37:00.000Z	Pici	DJones	No worries, it was a bit obvious :)
2010-11-26T21:10:00.000Z	DJones	Pici	:)
2011-05-26T19:12:00.000Z	DJones	Pici	Thanks, thought that might be useful today
2011-05-26T19:12:00.000Z	Pici	DJones	Indeedy.
2011-05-31T19:01:00.000Z	Pici	DJones	I just aliased !pamerr to the same factoid, for future reference.
2011-05-31T19:02:00.000Z	DJones	Pici	Thanks, I'd hadn't quite noticed the full !trigger, that was just my mistake
