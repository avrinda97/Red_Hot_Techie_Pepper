2011-11-10T12:38:00.000Z	JZApples		I'm using Ubuntu 11.10, why is the Update Manager trying to send me plugins for Gwibber when I don't have it installed???
2011-11-10T12:38:00.000Z	Starminn	JZApples	Did you remove or purge it?
2011-11-10T12:38:00.000Z	JZApples	Starminn	I think I uninstalled it via the Software Center.
2011-11-10T12:39:00.000Z	Starminn	JZApples	When you uninstall through the Software Center it simply removes the core program, but many extra settings (profile data, logs, preferences, etc.) still remain.
2011-11-10T12:39:00.000Z	Starminn	JZApples	Try running "sudo apt-get purge gwibber"
2011-11-10T12:41:00.000Z	Starminn	JZApples	If it says it's not installed just "sudo apt-get install gwibber && sudo apt-get purge gwibber". Anyway, after the purge runs fine, just "sudo apt-get update" and check the updates again
2011-11-10T12:44:00.000Z	JZApples	Starminn	thanks dawg
2011-11-10T12:45:00.000Z	JZApples	Starminn	but they're still there
2011-11-10T12:45:00.000Z	JZApples	Starminn	i just had a similar issue with removing deluge
2011-11-10T12:45:00.000Z	JZApples	Starminn	just wouldn't go away
2011-11-10T12:46:00.000Z	Starminn	JZApples	Hmm... One sec. I don't use Gwibber anyway so I'll try to delete and reproduce it.
2011-11-10T12:49:00.000Z	Starminn	JZApples	I'm not being asked for upgrades. But then, it may have been fully upgraded anyway. Run "sudo apt-get upgrade" and what package names are in "The following packages will be upgraded:"?
2011-11-10T12:49:00.000Z	JZApples	Starminn	it's also trying to install evolution.  I uninstalled evolution when I had 11.04.

2011-11-10T12:51:00.000Z	Starminn	JZApples	Person had the same problem here: http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/ubuntu-63/11-10-with-ubuntu1-and-gwibber-removed-still-getting-gwibber-updates-912325/ The fix was "sudo apt-get purge "gwibber.*""
2011-11-10T12:53:00.000Z	Starminn	JZApples	As for Evolution, I'd suggest something similar. "sudo apt-get purge evolution "evolution.*" "evolution-*"" should be overkill but fix it. :)
2011-11-10T12:53:00.000Z	JZApples	Starminn	thanks man, i'm off to bed
2011-11-10T12:53:00.000Z	Starminn	JZApples	Sure thing. :)
