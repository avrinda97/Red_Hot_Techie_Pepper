2006-09-05T11:20:00.000Z	npster	jozzeph	try installing gsfonts and gsfonts-x11 some things such as flash need those to use text
2006-09-05T11:21:00.000Z	npster	jozzeph	just gsfonts and gsfonts-x11, search synaptic for these
2006-09-05T11:36:00.000Z	npster	jozzeph	do as I told you before !!!
2006-09-05T11:37:00.000Z	npster	jozzeph	difficult to look a bit in synaptic
2006-09-05T11:39:00.000Z	npster	jozzeph	do this. open terminal. write sudo apt-get install gsfonts
2006-09-05T11:39:00.000Z	npster	jozzeph	input your password and wait
2006-09-05T11:40:00.000Z	npster	jozzeph	just do as I tell you ok. It is not contagious
2006-09-05T11:41:00.000Z	npster	jozzeph	then try this. sudo apt-get install gsfonts-x11
2006-09-05T11:42:00.000Z	npster	jozzeph	I have nothing else to tell you, reinstall java
