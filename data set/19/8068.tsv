2007-05-17T06:02:00.000Z	rollerskatejamms		on top of that, can anybody reccomend a good Ruby IDE and or Editor thats in the repositories (please don't say VI/emacs)
2007-05-17T06:02:00.000Z	Aoirthoir	rollerskatejamms	lots of ides have plugins, you might like eclipse.
2007-05-17T06:03:00.000Z	rollerskatejamms	Aoirthoir	I thought Eclipse was for Java
2007-05-17T06:03:00.000Z	Aoirthoir	rollerskatejamms	no. It started out for java but has lots of plugins
2007-05-17T06:03:00.000Z	Aoirthoir	rollerskatejamms	in addition its also written in java, thus the reason I dont use it. Not fond of the interface
2007-05-17T06:04:00.000Z	Aoirthoir	rollerskatejamms	are you looking for an IDE? or just an editor?
2007-05-17T06:04:00.000Z	Aoirthoir	rollerskatejamms	eclipse-gcj is probably based on eclipse
2007-05-17T06:05:00.000Z	rollerskatejamms	Aoirthoir	It is. Eclipse-gcj is compiled eclipse.
2007-05-17T06:05:00.000Z	Aoirthoir	rollerskatejamms	unfortunately atm there are not a lot of good FOSS IDEs
2007-05-17T06:05:00.000Z	Aoirthoir	rollerskatejamms	and only a few good proprietary ones...clarion being among them. But it doesnt run on Gnu/Linux
2007-05-17T06:05:00.000Z	Aoirthoir	rollerskatejamms	not even in wine
2007-05-17T06:06:00.000Z	rollerskatejamms	Aoirthoir	Yeah. And I've tried running some stuff on vmware, but I find vmware to be so slow on ubuntu for whatever reason
2007-05-17T06:06:00.000Z	Aoirthoir	rollerskatejamms	you have to have a LOT of ram to run things on a virtual machine well. Windows requires a lot of ram period.
2007-05-17T06:07:00.000Z	Aoirthoir	rollerskatejamms	512 is enough for like xp.. and it sounds like your specs are up to par. On my system it didnt run slow with those settings.
2007-05-17T06:07:00.000Z	Aoirthoir	rollerskatejamms	so thats probably not the issue...
2007-05-17T06:08:00.000Z	rollerskatejamms	Aoirthoir	My main machine (my laptop), is a 1.6 Ghz Turion 64 X2, with 2gb DDR2 ram.
2007-05-17T06:08:00.000Z	Aoirthoir	rollerskatejamms	yeah thats enough.
2007-05-17T06:08:00.000Z	Aoirthoir	rollerskatejamms	when you say IDE what exactly are you looking for? you can pm me also if you want...less channel noise
2007-05-17T06:08:00.000Z	rollerskatejamms	Aoirthoir	I'll be back in a bit. I have class now :-D
