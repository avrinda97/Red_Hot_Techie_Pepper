2007-08-17T14:14:00.000Z	fiction	bharathyd	alrighty. but its a problem with the way your xorg.conf is setup.
2007-08-17T14:15:00.000Z	fiction	bharathyd	go through your xorg.conf and see if anything doesnt look right
2007-08-17T14:16:00.000Z	fiction	bharathyd	were you here last night?
2007-08-17T14:16:00.000Z	fiction	bharathyd	oh okay
2007-08-17T14:17:00.000Z	fiction	bharathyd	tip: when talking t someone here in irc, put their name first. type the first letters of their username and press tab. see what happens
2007-08-17T14:17:00.000Z	bharathyd	fiction	ok done
2007-08-17T14:17:00.000Z	fiction	bharathyd	see, easy huh? dont have to copy and paste their names
2007-08-17T14:18:00.000Z	fiction	bharathyd	when you put someones name in the sentence, itll be easier for them to find (usually in red, example), and if their irc client is minimized, it will blink so they know someone is talking tot hem
2007-08-17T14:18:00.000Z	bharathyd	fiction	 and if i have a problem of more than 10 lines how shud i post in a single one...how the buddies understand that
2007-08-17T14:19:00.000Z	fiction	bharathyd	try to keep it simple in 3 lines. if it's a code thing, use a pastebin. for example, if you want others to look at your xorg.conf, copy and paste it to www.pastebin.ca (or the pastebin of your choice)
