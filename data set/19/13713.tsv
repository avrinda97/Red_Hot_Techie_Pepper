2005-03-19T14:10:00.000Z	selinium_		Yes i have got both. but then i need to configure apache? That is all i really needed to know. I didn't want to mess up anything if it had already configured itself.
2005-03-19T14:11:00.000Z	selinium_		cheer hile the the pointers
2005-03-19T14:13:00.000Z	hile	selinium_	see docs in /usr/share/doc/php4-curl/ and /usr/share/doc/libapache2-mod-php4 (if you use apache2)
2005-03-19T14:13:00.000Z	selinium_	hile	you star!
2005-03-19T14:14:00.000Z	hile	selinium_	just tested installing php4-curl, seems it configures itself to /etc/php4/apache2/php.ini automatically
2005-03-19T14:14:00.000Z	hile		and now I'll remove it, I have no use for php4-curl ;)
2005-03-19T14:14:00.000Z	selinium_		Aargh: that was what i was worried about!
2005-03-19T14:15:00.000Z	hile	selinium_	it just includes the php4-curl automatically to config, which makes sense: if you install it, you most likely want to use it as well...
2005-03-19T14:16:00.000Z	hile		only line I saw ther was extension=curl.so
2005-03-19T14:16:00.000Z	selinium_		That was what i figured. I dont understand why it hasn't configured. I assume you just did a phpinfo on it?
2005-03-19T14:17:00.000Z	hile		nope I didn't, but did you run apache2ctl restart
2005-03-19T14:17:00.000Z	selinium_		hile; That was what i figured. I dont understand why it hasn't configured. I assume you just did a phpinfo on it?
2005-03-19T14:17:00.000Z	hile		no, and as I said, did you refresh apache?
2005-03-19T14:22:00.000Z	selinium_	hile	sorry, yes I refreshed apache
2005-03-19T14:23:00.000Z	hile	selinium_	well, my phpinfo has 'CURL Information  libcurl/7.12.3 OpenSSL/0.9.7e zlib/1.2.2 libidn/0.5.2
2005-03-19T14:23:00.000Z	hile		CURL Information  libcurl/7.12.3 OpenSSL/0.9.7e zlib/1.2.2 libidn/0.5.2
2005-03-19T14:23:00.000Z	hile		oops
2005-03-19T14:37:00.000Z	selinium_	hile	Got it! for some reason. The first restart didn't get it. Thanks for your help!
2005-03-19T14:37:00.000Z	hile	selinium_	good ;)
