2009-10-21T07:54:00.000Z	Angel-SL		Hey guys
2009-10-21T07:54:00.000Z	Angel-SL		I have a VPS who's time is set to 10:54AM, GMT+8
2009-10-21T07:54:00.000Z	Angel-SL		however the timezone is set to UTC
2009-10-21T07:55:00.000Z	Angel-SL		I have a VPS who's time is set to 10:54AM. However, it thinks the timezone is UTC, while it should be GMT+8. If I change it to GMT+8, it adds eight more hours to the clock. How do I change the timezone without changing the clock?
2009-10-21T07:55:00.000Z	Angel-SL		re what?
2009-10-21T07:56:00.000Z	Angel-SL		It's on a VPS
2009-10-21T07:56:00.000Z	Angel-SL		which means I can't change the time
2009-10-21T07:56:00.000Z	Angel-SL		:|
2009-10-21T07:56:00.000Z	Angel-SL		basically, 21 Oct 10:57:25 ntpdate[30144]: step-systime: Operation not permitted
2009-10-21T07:57:00.000Z	Random832	Angel-SL	well so what, the VPS thinks the hardware clock it sees is on UTC when it's on local time?
2009-10-21T07:57:00.000Z	Random832		maybe there's a configuration there that can fix it
2009-10-21T07:58:00.000Z	Angel-SL	Random832	Not too sure.
2009-10-21T08:02:00.000Z	Angel-SL	Random832	well..?
2009-10-21T08:02:00.000Z	Random832	Angel-SL	i don't know much about VPSes
2009-10-21T08:02:00.000Z	Random832		is that like a virtual machine?
2009-10-21T08:02:00.000Z	Angel-SL		you don't need to know about VPSes
2009-10-21T08:03:00.000Z	Angel-SL		what I need to know
2009-10-21T08:03:00.000Z	Angel-SL		is how to change TZ without changing local time
2009-10-21T08:04:00.000Z	Random832	Angel-SL	no, i don't think that's right...
