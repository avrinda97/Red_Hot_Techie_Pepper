2009-05-20T09:16:00.000Z	th0r	FluxD	http://paste.ubuntu.com/176138/
2009-05-20T09:16:00.000Z	th0r	FluxD	I used it once or twice...but it has been a while. Still, the info should be valid
2009-05-20T09:17:00.000Z	FluxD	th0r	arand, raylu, usr13 is it due to the fact that ubuntu is on an extended partition?
2009-05-20T09:20:00.000Z	FluxD	th0r	arand, raylu, usr13 I am going to try http://paste.ubuntu.com/176138/
2009-05-20T09:21:00.000Z	th0r	FluxD	when you are ready we can discuss the hd(0,0) thing
2009-05-20T09:22:00.000Z	th0r	FluxD	sounds like the drive may have crashed
2009-05-20T09:22:00.000Z	th0r	FluxD	does xp or vista boot? Can you get even a start at booting up?
2009-05-20T09:22:00.000Z	FluxD	th0r	I am on that drive right now
2009-05-20T09:23:00.000Z	FluxD	th0r	vista and xp boots fine
2009-05-20T09:23:00.000Z	th0r	FluxD	are you on a livecd now?
2009-05-20T09:24:00.000Z	FluxD	th0r	yes

2009-05-20T09:26:00.000Z	th0r	FluxD	arand is correct, for sda6 it should be hd0,5
2009-05-20T09:28:00.000Z	FluxD	th0r	arand, raylu, usr13 http://pastebin.ca/1428133
2009-05-20T09:31:00.000Z	th0r	FluxD	the pastebin looks like you got it
2009-05-20T09:31:00.000Z	FluxD	th0r	arand, raylu, usr13 I will readd ubuntu using bcd and test it and come back
