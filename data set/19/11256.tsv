2006-06-07T11:34:00.000Z	Frogzoo	kosnick	first you create a partition, then mkswap to create the swapfs, THEN swapon
2006-06-07T11:35:00.000Z	Frogzoo	kosnick	nothing - zero - nada
2006-06-07T11:35:00.000Z	kosnick	Frogzoo	: do you know what .ICEauthority is for? cause i got a prob with and i can't boot , i thought it had to do with swap
2006-06-07T11:36:00.000Z	Frogzoo	kosnick	.ICEauthority won't stop you booting, but it will cause you problems running X programs
2006-06-07T11:36:00.000Z	kosnick	Frogzoo	: yes thats exactly my prob, is there any way i can fix it?
2006-06-07T11:37:00.000Z	Frogzoo	kosnick	delete it & restart X or reboot
2006-06-07T11:37:00.000Z	kosnick	Frogzoo	: just delete the file
2006-06-07T11:37:00.000Z	Frogzoo	kosnick	yup, & restart X
2006-06-07T11:38:00.000Z	kosnick	Frogzoo	: how do i restart X , just reboot?
2006-06-07T11:38:00.000Z	Frogzoo	kosnick	logout & 'ctrl alt delete' should do it
2006-06-07T11:38:00.000Z	Frogzoo	kosnick	logout & 'ctrl alt backspace' should do it
2006-06-07T11:39:00.000Z	kosnick	Frogzoo	: i think there are lots (about 3) .ICEauthority files (some of them have some extension more) .  I should delete only the .ICEauthority one
2006-06-07T11:40:00.000Z	Frogzoo	kosnick	in your user directory? there should one be .ICEauthority - no .ICEanything else
2006-06-07T11:41:00.000Z	kosnick	Frogzoo	: if i remember right there another 2 files something like .ICEauthorityblablabla
2006-06-07T11:43:00.000Z	Frogzoo	kosnick	noafaik...
