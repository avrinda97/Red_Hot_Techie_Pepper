2007-01-07T08:52:00.000Z	asdfjkahsdfjkha		aggort yes
2007-01-07T08:53:00.000Z	asdfjkahsdfjkha		aggort, I could play all the hl1 modifications but I didnt have hl2 when I did it. But to my knowledge yes
2007-01-07T08:54:00.000Z	asdfjkahsdfjkha		aggort, war rock is just a mod of HL2 and if you can run hl2 then you can run a mod of it
2007-01-07T08:55:00.000Z	asdfjkahsdfjkha		aggort, I just used wine to install/run steam then used it like I was on windows
2007-01-07T08:56:00.000Z	asdfjkahsdfjkha		but you should use cedega since its made for gaming
2007-01-07T08:56:00.000Z	asdfjkahsdfjkha		wasnt cedega originally winex ?
2007-01-07T08:56:00.000Z	asdfjkahsdfjkha		aggort no
2007-01-07T08:57:00.000Z	kitche	asdfjkahsdfjkha	cedega is winex
2007-01-07T08:59:00.000Z	kitche	asdfjkahsdfjkha	with cedega you pay for development and support it's not easy getting all those games working nicely
2007-01-07T08:59:00.000Z	asdfjkahsdfjkha	kitche	I know I am just stating opinion
2007-01-07T10:11:00.000Z	kitche	asdfjkahsdfjkha	that's ebcuase that package doesn't exist
2007-01-07T10:11:00.000Z	kitche	asdfjkahsdfjkha	you probably want linux-tree
2007-01-14T07:15:00.000Z	kitche	asdfjkahsdfjkha	lookat package manager it's called libc6 in ubuntu
2007-01-14T07:16:00.000Z	asdfjkahsdfjkha	kitche	I am running server edition. no gui
2007-01-14T07:16:00.000Z	kitche	asdfjkahsdfjkha	so you still have a package manager look at aptitude
2007-01-14T07:21:00.000Z	kitche	asdfjkahsdfjkha	you can't really
2007-01-14T07:22:00.000Z	asdfjkahsdfjkha	kitche	? why
2007-01-14T07:22:00.000Z	kitche	asdfjkahsdfjkha	only if you want to rebuild your system pretty much
