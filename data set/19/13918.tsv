2004-12-20T14:03:00.000Z	magneto		iso2bin
2004-12-20T14:03:00.000Z	palle1		okay thanx
2004-12-20T14:13:00.000Z	magneto		linuxjones- google theres plenty of info out there
2004-12-20T14:15:00.000Z	magneto		tru quad - with loss and errors
2004-12-20T14:15:00.000Z	magneto		linuxjones - sometimes i download 350mb for a 320mb file with bt
2004-12-20T14:16:00.000Z	magneto		Linuxjones- no its common
2004-12-20T14:16:00.000Z	magneto		moreso with bt than ftp scp http
2004-12-20T14:18:00.000Z	magneto		Linuxjones: is it for server load issues?
2004-12-20T14:19:00.000Z	magneto		linuxjones-  could be a cheap solution
2004-12-20T14:19:00.000Z	magneto		depending on a few things
2004-12-20T14:20:00.000Z	magneto		im assuming the data changes daily weekly - disparate locations
2004-12-20T14:20:00.000Z	magneto		quad- of course not- but he obviously wants a nonstandard solution
2004-12-20T14:20:00.000Z	magneto		gl linuxjones
2004-12-20T14:21:00.000Z	palle1		when i try to open an iso file in k3b it says "could not open document!"
2004-12-20T14:21:00.000Z	magneto	palle1	- choose burn data disc
