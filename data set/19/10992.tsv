2006-05-21T13:21:00.000Z	Remy		hey guys, does anyone know of a html editor for ubuntu like microsoft's frontpage ?
2006-05-21T13:21:00.000Z	dooglus	Remy	bluefish?
2006-05-21T13:22:00.000Z	dooglus	Remy	there's another one that I've seen recommended a few times, but I forget its name
2006-05-21T13:23:00.000Z	dooglus	Remy	run "apt-cache search HTML editor | grep -i html | grep -i edit" to get a list of suggestions
2006-05-21T13:24:00.000Z	dooglus	Remy	I remembered.  It's called 'nvu'.  Check that out too :)
2006-05-21T13:27:00.000Z	Remy	dooglus	- NVU is pefect.  Thanks :)
2006-05-21T13:28:00.000Z	dooglus	Remy	did you try bluefish too?
2006-05-21T13:28:00.000Z	Remy	dooglus	- yes, I like NVU more allready :D
2006-05-21T13:28:00.000Z	dooglus	Remy	ok, cool.
2006-05-21T13:29:00.000Z	Remy	dooglus	it's just cause I'm quite used to frontpage, and NVU is at first glance more similar to it than bluefish
2006-05-21T13:29:00.000Z	Remy	dooglus	 - keep a live CD handy next to each one ?
2006-05-21T13:32:00.000Z	Remy	dooglus	- spikeb's suggestion is a pretty good one :)
2006-05-21T13:32:00.000Z	dooglus	Remy	hmmm.  I don't have a USB key though.  I guess I could buy one, but arent' they quite limited in size?  like to 2 or 4 Gb?
2006-05-21T13:33:00.000Z	Remy	dooglus	- yup
2006-05-21T13:33:00.000Z	Remy	dooglus	- if you want to lash out a couple a hundred $ you could always buy a laptop size external hdd
2006-05-21T13:34:00.000Z	dooglus	Remy	hmmm.  I already did.  :)  I wonder where I put it...
2006-05-21T13:34:00.000Z	dooglus	Remy	I've got a feeling I left it about 1000 miles away from where I am now.
2006-05-21T13:34:00.000Z	Remy	dooglus	- something like : http://www.dse.com.au/cgi-bin/dse.storefront/4469819807086d3c2741c0a87f9c06ef/Product/View/XH8253
2006-05-21T13:36:00.000Z	dooglus	Remy	oh, I see.  I misunderstood... my external HDD is about the same size as a laptop, not a laptop's hdd :)
