2008-03-06T00:48:00.000Z	Captain_Haddock		Hi, I'm looking to purchase a laptop (incidentally, my first one) and am looking for something that will work well with ubuntu / kubuntu. I would appreciate any advice on how best to choose one.
2008-03-06T00:49:00.000Z	Captain_Haddock		I'd obviously not like to pay for a copy of Windows Vista while doing so either.
2008-03-06T00:50:00.000Z	Captain_Haddock		I don't want to pay for it either
2008-03-06T00:50:00.000Z	Captain_Haddock		and I want a laptop that will run well under kubuntu
2008-03-06T00:52:00.000Z	Captain_Haddock		but the windows vista point is also important to me as I don't want to support M$
2008-03-06T00:53:00.000Z	danand	Captain_Haddock	- check out http://www.linux-on-laptops.com/ and http://tuxmobil.org/
2008-03-06T00:53:00.000Z	Captain_Haddock	danand	cheers!
2008-03-06T00:55:00.000Z	danand	Captain_Haddock	- also check out Ubuntu's home page - pretty sure they give a list of certified hardware that ubuntu runs on inc the Toshiba Satellite U300 - which imo is a v nice maching
2008-03-06T00:56:00.000Z	danand	Captain_Haddock	- see http://webapps.ubuntu.com/certification/
2008-03-06T00:56:00.000Z	Captain_Haddock	danand	Thanks. No HD-DVD drive I hope :)
2008-03-06T00:57:00.000Z	danand	Captain_Haddock	- :)
2008-03-06T00:57:00.000Z	Captain_Haddock	danand	that is very helpful - thanks. Most of the sites I've been checking out are dated. This looks promising.
2008-03-06T00:58:00.000Z	danand	Captain_Haddock	- np :)
2008-03-06T01:00:00.000Z	Captain_Haddock	danand	any idea what the norm is nowadays in terms of battery life? 4 hours?
2008-03-06T01:01:00.000Z	danand	Captain_Haddock	- I have no idea - my poor old dell c400 now has a battery life of about 15mins -
2008-03-06T01:23:00.000Z	Captain_Haddock	danand	do you know if Toshiba allow you to ditch windows?
2008-03-06T01:24:00.000Z	danand	Captain_Haddock	- not sure - be suprised if it was easy to do :)
2008-03-06T01:25:00.000Z	danand	Captain_Haddock	- why not go for the dell? I've always found dell rather good
2008-03-06T01:26:00.000Z	Captain_Haddock	danand	I actually want to - but they essentially told me that it's not possible except on their precision models.
