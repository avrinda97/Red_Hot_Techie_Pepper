2006-04-13T07:53:00.000Z	vividhaze		it just says error 22.
2006-04-13T07:54:00.000Z	vividhaze		ok well thats my problem :) GRUB Error 22 just comes up.
2006-04-13T07:54:00.000Z	vividhaze		isn't there a way to bypass putting GRUB on?  I only want Ubuntu on my comp anyway
2006-04-13T07:54:00.000Z	vividhaze		no WinXP
2006-04-13T07:56:00.000Z	vividhaze		cook thanks DBO
2006-04-13T07:56:00.000Z	vividhaze		DB0 even if you could find a way to just not bother about GRUB and just let Ubuntu load up cause I haven't got any other systems on my comp
2006-04-13T07:57:00.000Z	vividhaze		I'm using a Live-CD of Kanotix atm to get in here :S
2006-04-13T07:57:00.000Z	vividhaze		lol
2006-04-13T07:57:00.000Z	vividhaze		but I want ubuntu
2006-04-13T07:57:00.000Z	vividhaze		I remember ages ago i just had RH on my computer and it didn't need a loader, maybe things have changed.
2006-04-13T07:58:00.000Z	errpast_	vividhaze	On install with Ubuntu, there is an option to wipe entire disk and put on Ubuntu
2006-04-13T07:59:00.000Z	errpast_	vividhaze	 a couple minutes in.  I'm just installing Ubuntu on a laptop and desktop and got those options
2006-04-13T07:59:00.000Z	vividhaze	errpast_	the bit you can decide to manually partition or just use a whole HDD?
2006-04-13T08:00:00.000Z	errpast_	vividhaze	yes, that bit shows up about 2 minutes in
2006-04-13T08:00:00.000Z	errpast_	vividhaze	I believe the MBR will be written to boot sector of hd0.  multiple disks are certainly ok
2006-04-13T08:01:00.000Z	errpast_	vividhaze	when you get error 22, does it appear to be coming from Grub?
2006-04-13T08:02:00.000Z	errpast_	vividhaze	let me poke around.  I believe I got that once.
2006-04-13T08:03:00.000Z	errpast_	vividhaze	try http://lists.trolltech.com/qt-interest/2004-07/thread00053-0.html
2006-04-13T08:07:00.000Z	errpast_	vividhaze	I thought you were using a Kanotix live CD to get in there
