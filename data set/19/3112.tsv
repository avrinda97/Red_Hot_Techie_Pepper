2009-10-25T05:56:00.000Z	dogon		hello
2009-10-25T05:56:00.000Z	dogon		I need a little help
2009-10-25T05:56:00.000Z	dogon		I can't run an executable
2009-10-25T05:57:00.000Z	dogon		Hello, I'm trying to run an executable given to me by my teacher, but for some reason it doesn't work...
2009-10-25T05:59:00.000Z	vlt	dogon	Maybe it doesn't match your kernel?
2009-10-25T05:00:00.000Z	vlt	dogon	Is it an ELF file?
2009-10-25T05:01:00.000Z	dogon	vlt	I don't know if it's an ELF file... it was in a tar, when I extracted it into the directory the file type is just listed as "executable"
2009-10-25T05:02:00.000Z	vlt	dogon	hmmm ... What does `file referee` say?
2009-10-25T05:04:00.000Z	vlt	dogon	What does `uname -a` say?
2009-10-25T05:05:00.000Z	vlt	dogon	Maybe you're running an x86 kernel
2009-10-25T05:05:00.000Z	dogon	vlt	I'm pretty sure I'm running an x86 carnel...
2009-10-25T05:06:00.000Z	vlt	dogon	If it's x86 32bit it probably won't work.
2009-10-25T05:07:00.000Z	dogon	vlt	that's a pretty retarded teacher I have... I assume he gave me a 64 bit executable?
2009-10-25T05:07:00.000Z	vlt	dogon	That's what `file` says, yes. The 64 bit part, I mean
2009-10-25T05:08:00.000Z	vlt	dogon	`grep lm /proc/cpuinfo`
2009-10-25T05:11:00.000Z	vlt	dogon	Can you run a virtual 64bit machine on a 32bit kernel?
2009-10-25T05:13:00.000Z	vlt	dogon	I thought you said your OS was 32bit ...
2009-10-25T05:13:00.000Z	dogon	vlt	yes, ubuntu is 32 bit, but I'm running it on a VM
2009-10-25T05:14:00.000Z	dogon	vlt	I didn't want to say the W or the V word, but I'll say it... I'm running a 64 bit Windows Vista and I have a Sun VirtualBox for ubuntu
