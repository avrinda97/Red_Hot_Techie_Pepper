2012-08-01T19:49:00.000Z	alexidoia		hi there, I just bought a new Sony Bravia Led TV, I need a PIC card that output HDMI, any advice on GNU compatible ones ?
2012-08-01T19:50:00.000Z	L3top	alexidoia	I would suggest sticking with nvidia.
2012-08-01T19:50:00.000Z	alexidoia	L3top	nvidia is a driver, but what PCI card can I use ?
2012-08-01T19:51:00.000Z	alexidoia	L3top	so any card ?
2012-08-01T19:53:00.000Z	alexidoia	L3top	what us VDPAU, and I don't think I have PCIe, let me check
2012-08-01T19:53:00.000Z	L3top	alexidoia	Video accelleration. It shares the task between the GPU and CPU for cleaner playback, especially high definition.
2012-08-01T19:54:00.000Z	alexidoia	L3top	ok I have PCIe, so what card would be good ?
2012-08-01T19:55:00.000Z	L3top	alexidoia	pretty much anything nvidia at this point.
2012-08-01T19:55:00.000Z	alexidoia	L3top	but Nvidia build card ?
2012-08-01T19:56:00.000Z	alexidoia	L3top	ok they do, sorry did not know that, any particular recommendation ?
2012-08-01T19:56:00.000Z	L3top	alexidoia	there are basically 4 manufacturers, nVidia, ATI, intel (these are onboard) and via (also onboard).
2012-08-01T19:57:00.000Z	L3top	alexidoia	anything 8300+ will do VDPAU and play video cleanly. (this includes all of the 2xx-6xx, they are actually newer)
2012-08-01T19:57:00.000Z	alexidoia	L3top	thanks a lot for this
2012-08-01T20:01:00.000Z	alexidoia	L3top	what about this one : http://www.amazon.com/EVGA-GeForce-Express-Graphics-01G-P3-1302-LR/dp/B0049MPQA4/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top
2012-08-01T20:03:00.000Z	alexidoia	L3top	I'd like something silent, I don't mind spending more
2012-08-01T20:11:00.000Z	alexidoia	L3top	the card I showed you is a little old and is not very silent, you would not have something to advise me ?
2012-08-01T20:12:00.000Z	L3top	alexidoia	this is really offtopic for ubuntu support... but I would probably go with something more like this http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E1http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E168141214226814121422
2012-08-01T20:13:00.000Z	alexidoia	L3top	sorry for the off topic, is there a channel for this ? Your link is broken
2012-08-01T20:14:00.000Z	L3top	alexidoia	pm.
