2008-06-14T22:02:00.000Z	Zababa		Hello, I need help with mp3 playback in Ubuntu 8.04. Yesterday I could play mp3 files in VLC player, but not today. Today I have installed and uninstalled some libraries when I tried installing sidplay2. But now MP3 is not playing. Totem movie player said I need codecs for MP3 but even when I installed them, it does not play.
2008-06-14T22:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Zababa	you got amarok?
2008-06-14T22:02:00.000Z	Zababa	ActionParsnip	not that I know.
2008-06-14T22:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Zababa	amarok will offer to install mp3 decoders if one is not found
2008-06-14T22:03:00.000Z	Zababa	ActionParsnip	so did Totem player, I think. It installed them, I saw it... but I still cannot play them.
2008-06-14T22:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Zababa	any messages when you try to play em?
2008-06-14T22:04:00.000Z	Zababa	ActionParsnip	No, VLC does like playing (Timecode counting) but no sound comes out. Totem player does not start timecode count ... put its play button changes to Pause... like if it was playing.
2008-06-14T22:14:00.000Z	Zababa	ActionParsnip	ok... will try reinstall VLC.
