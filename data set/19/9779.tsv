2007-12-22T11:11:00.000Z	FluxD		Hi, I setup a VNC server but am getting a connection error. Can someone help?
2007-12-22T11:13:00.000Z	macogw	FluxD	are the right ports open / forwarded on the router
2007-12-22T11:14:00.000Z	FluxD	macogw	there is no router on ubuntu machine how can I check if a port is open in netstat the program is running
2007-12-22T11:14:00.000Z	macogw	FluxD	oh all ports are closed until a service opens it up.  if ssh-server is on the ubuntu machine, you should be able to ssh to it
2007-12-22T11:14:00.000Z	FluxD	macogw	how do I do that connect to 127.0.0.1 ?
2007-12-22T11:15:00.000Z	macogw	FluxD	what?
2007-12-22T11:15:00.000Z	FluxD	macogw	I have ssh access on ubuntu machine how would I get vnc working?
2007-12-22T11:15:00.000Z	macogw	FluxD	that's where youd find a site if you had a web server running on your computer
2007-12-22T11:15:00.000Z	macogw	FluxD	are you trying to get into windows or into ubuntu?
2007-12-22T11:15:00.000Z	FluxD	macogw	from windows to ubuntu( connecting to ubuntu)
2007-12-22T11:16:00.000Z	macogw	FluxD	does the windows machine have any outbound ports blocked?
2007-12-22T11:16:00.000Z	macogw	FluxD	ive never used vnc, im just trying to think of why things wouldnt connect
2007-12-22T11:16:00.000Z	FluxD	macogw	its allowed to connect
2007-12-22T11:17:00.000Z	macogw	FluxD	is the vnc server running on the ubuntu machine?
2007-12-22T11:17:00.000Z	FluxD	macogw	yes
2007-12-22T11:17:00.000Z	macogw	FluxD	what port does vnc run on? are you aiming for the right port from windows?
2007-12-22T11:17:00.000Z	macogw	FluxD	and do you have a vnc client on windows?
2007-12-22T11:18:00.000Z	FluxD	macogw	vnc runnning on 5901 I think thats default? tighvnc viewr on windows
2007-12-22T11:21:00.000Z	FluxD	macogw	computertech99 how do I check if a port is open and connectable?
