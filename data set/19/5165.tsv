2008-08-20T19:20:00.000Z	Gnea	Av1	yes.
2008-08-20T19:20:00.000Z	Av1	Gnea	can you please tell me
2008-08-20T19:21:00.000Z	Gnea	Av1	dpkg -l | grep ^ii | grep ati\
2008-08-20T19:21:00.000Z	Gnea	Av1	make sure you put the \ at the end
2008-08-20T19:21:00.000Z	Gnea	Av1	and a space after it
2008-08-20T19:23:00.000Z	Av1	Gnea	it is saying "new restricted driver in use"
2008-08-20T19:24:00.000Z	Gnea	Av1	then it should be working just fine.  try this: grep Driver /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2008-08-20T19:25:00.000Z	Gnea	Av1	yes, you are definitely using the ati driver :)
2008-08-20T19:28:00.000Z	Gnea	Av1	check out that first url, it tells you how
2008-08-20T19:29:00.000Z	Av1	Gnea	should i check hp website for drivers?
2008-08-20T19:29:00.000Z	Gnea	Av1	the *first* URL
2008-08-20T19:30:00.000Z	Gnea	Av1	and since you have an HP, look for info on there about setting up HPLIP
