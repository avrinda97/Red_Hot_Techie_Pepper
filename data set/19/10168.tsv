2006-08-06T14:02:00.000Z	eternalswd		does anyone know of a program like TaskSwitchXP for Gnome?
2006-08-06T14:03:00.000Z	eternalswd		basically I just want a program that gives access to the tasklist that stays until I select a task
2006-08-06T14:04:00.000Z	dooglus	eternalswd	did you see gnome's window list things?
2006-08-06T14:05:00.000Z	eternalswd	dooglus	where do I look that up?
2006-08-06T14:05:00.000Z	dooglus	eternalswd	right-click on the panel, say 'add to panel' and choose 'window list' or 'window selector' or something like that - I forget which.
2006-08-06T14:06:00.000Z	eternalswd	dooglus	I already have that, I want something that pops up in a window until I select the program with the mouse.  That way I can save panel space and bring up the program with wayv
2006-08-06T14:07:00.000Z	dooglus	eternalswd	check again - there are 2 options - one is what you have, and the other is a small icon that gives a menu when you click in
2006-08-06T14:38:00.000Z	eternalswd	dooglus	just so you know I found the taskswitch program I've been looking for.  It's called skippy.  I now have everything I had in windblows in open source goodness :)
2006-08-06T14:39:00.000Z	dooglus	eternalswd	thanks for getting back to me with that.  I've not seen it, but will give it a go
2006-08-06T14:40:00.000Z	eternalswd	dooglus	it's in the repos
2006-08-06T14:42:00.000Z	dooglus	eternalswd	yes, I know.  I've just tried it, and it's quite nice.
2006-08-06T14:42:00.000Z	dooglus	eternalswd	shame it doesn't update the graphics though
2006-08-06T14:43:00.000Z	eternalswd	dooglus	I believe the graphics update for currently raised windows.
2006-08-06T14:44:00.000Z	dooglus	eternalswd	I see it's an option - Please note that the default skippy behaviour is *not* to update the
2006-08-06T14:44:00.000Z	eternalswd	dooglus	ooh, how do I fix it
2006-08-06T14:45:00.000Z	dooglus	eternalswd	first "cp /etc/X11/skippy/skippyrc ~/.skippyrc" to copy the default config, then edit ~/.skippyrc
2006-08-06T14:47:00.000Z	eternalswd	dooglus	thanks, it's more configurable than I thought it would be
2006-08-06T14:50:00.000Z	dooglus	eternalswd	the autorefresh thing isn't good - it has to bring every window to the front to see what it looks like.
2006-08-06T14:50:00.000Z	dooglus	eternalswd	I liked what you suggested - if it kept an up-to-date picture of the current window - that'd be enough for me
