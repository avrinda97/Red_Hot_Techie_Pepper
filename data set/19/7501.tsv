2007-12-24T12:08:00.000Z	pvl1	abdulla	what do you mean? as far as i remember, they can do all of that
2007-12-24T12:09:00.000Z	abdulla	pvl1	error like this Failed to load media file "/home/abdulla/Pictures/.......a.jpg.dv"
2007-12-24T12:09:00.000Z	pvl1	abdulla	oh i see. well im not too sure about that. google the application, maybe theres a forum or something. i dont see why that function wouldnt be implemented
2007-12-24T12:10:00.000Z	pvl1	abdulla	is the jpg name have .dv at the end?
2007-12-24T12:10:00.000Z	abdulla	pvl1	no but i get a message when i import /home/abdulla/Pictures/71613-1.jpg" is not a DV file. Do you want to import it?
2007-12-24T12:11:00.000Z	pvl1	abdulla	hm i wouldnt know exactly about that
2007-12-24T12:23:00.000Z	abdulla	pvl1	kdenlive is great :) just what i was looking for
2007-12-24T12:27:00.000Z	pvl1	abdulla	look at the applications ubuntu media center has to offer. i forgot its exact name, btu that has the best
2007-12-24T12:28:00.000Z	pvl1	abdulla	i meant but
2007-12-24T12:30:00.000Z	pvl1	abdulla	its called ubuntu studio
2007-12-24T12:35:00.000Z	pvl1	abdulla	ubuntu studio is a version of ubuntu, if you will, that revolves around media. movies, music, it tries to make it as easy as possible
2007-12-24T12:35:00.000Z	abdulla	pvl1	i must reinstall ubuntu ?  or is this an app?
2007-12-24T12:36:00.000Z	pvl1	abdulla	also, almost all open source applications have documentation
2007-12-24T12:36:00.000Z	pvl1	abdulla	: well with something do so soon i wouldnt recommend installing it bc it is more of an operating system.
2007-12-24T12:37:00.000Z	pvl1	abdulla	you should check for documentation of this kdenlive
2007-12-24T12:37:00.000Z	pvl1	abdulla	i'd be surprised
2007-12-24T12:39:00.000Z	pvl1	abdulla	to be honest, the one tihng ive found XP to have over linx, is the backspace for internet, maybe some apps, and uhm, visual studio
2007-12-24T12:40:00.000Z	pvl1	abdulla	all of which i easily live without, if not better. but the reason that its hard to find its counterpart is because microsoft makes it as XP as possible
