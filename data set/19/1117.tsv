2011-06-14T03:56:00.000Z	jspiros		I'm helping a friend build a new machine, he uses Ubuntu exclusively, and he's interested in the Core i3 and using the IGP rather than an external chip, is that advisible?
2011-06-14T03:56:00.000Z	jspiros		All I'm seeing are reports from early 2010 about it being incompatible/problematic, but time has passed...
2011-06-14T03:58:00.000Z	ksni	jspiros	what sort of performance would be required? 2d, video, 3d, crysis?
2011-06-14T03:59:00.000Z	jspiros	ksni	lots of videos, 2d stuff... I know he wants to play Diablo 3 when it comes out (and he's hoping it'll work under Wine quickly), but I don't think that's a deal-breaker
2011-06-14T03:59:00.000Z	jspiros	ksni	otherwise not heavy 3d user
2011-06-14T04:00:00.000Z	jspiros	ksni	I think he does SNES emulation sometimes, but that definitely doesn't matter. I think the biggest issue is he likes to watch videos, sometimes HD
2011-06-14T04:01:00.000Z	ksni	jspiros	about that i3, is it Sandy Bridge or older? http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=intel_snb_natty&num=1
2011-06-14T04:03:00.000Z	jspiros	ksni	Clarkdale, not Sandy Bridge
2011-06-14T04:06:00.000Z	ksni	jspiros	I'm unsure about Diablo 3, but it should be enough for HD videos and older games
2011-06-14T04:07:00.000Z	jspiros	ksni	So the Clarkdale i3 IGP works fine with 11.04 afayk?
2011-06-14T04:10:00.000Z	ksni	jspiros	I have used it with 10.10 for a short while months ago, but ended up using my spare 9600GT
2011-06-14T04:10:00.000Z	ksni		can't remember how well it performed
2011-06-14T04:11:00.000Z	ksni		anyway, this http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=intel_clarkdale_gpu&num=3
2011-06-14T04:11:00.000Z	jspiros	ksni	thanks :)
2011-06-14T04:12:00.000Z	ksni	jspiros	it wasn't buggy or anything
2011-06-14T04:18:00.000Z	ksni	jspiros	ah, now I remember... the FPS rose from about 40 with the Clarkdale, to over 200 with the NVIDIA card in Minecraft with 1920x1080,fullscreen
2011-06-14T04:19:00.000Z	ksni	jspiros	so the Clarkdale performed only slightly better than my laptop from 5 years ago
2011-06-14T04:19:00.000Z	ksni		I'd recommend a separate card if he wants to play any recent games
2011-06-14T04:20:00.000Z	jspiros	ksni	which nVidia did you go to?
