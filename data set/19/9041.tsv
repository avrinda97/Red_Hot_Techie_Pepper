2007-07-27T08:00:00.000Z	raf256		on 3 boxes it worked afair, on 1 it dont work
2007-07-27T08:00:00.000Z	raf256		apache works but .php are downloaded
2007-07-27T08:01:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	raf256	Have you done a manual GET request to the problem server, to see what mime-type it reports for the PHP page?
2007-07-27T08:01:00.000Z	raf256		one second,
2007-07-27T08:01:00.000Z	raf256		but why?
2007-07-27T08:01:00.000Z	raf256		it should JUST WORK no?
2007-07-27T08:01:00.000Z	raf256		the instll was not customized nor anything
2007-07-27T08:01:00.000Z	raf256		if it fails to work by default then its a bug?
2007-07-27T08:01:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple		You've installed a web-site right?
2007-07-27T08:02:00.000Z	raf256		how to reinstall apache+php totally cleanly from start?
2007-07-27T08:02:00.000Z	raf256	IntuitiveNipple	yes, a file foo.php is downloaded instead interpreted
2007-07-27T08:02:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	raf256	so the site has its own apache configuration directives, I'd check those, and also, I'd be reading the /var/log/apache logs
2007-07-27T08:03:00.000Z	raf256		back in a second
2007-07-27T08:04:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	raf256	Have you tried putting a test "info.php" in the web-server's default home, rather than in the specific site, to see if it is a server or site problem?
2007-07-27T08:04:00.000Z	raf256	IntuitiveNipple	yes, that file is also downloaded
2007-07-27T08:06:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	raf256	And have you checked that the two php links are in /etc/apache2/mods-enabled?
2007-07-27T08:06:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple		(php5.load and php5.conf)
2007-07-27T08:14:00.000Z	raf256	IntuitiveNipple	I will in 15 min, brb
