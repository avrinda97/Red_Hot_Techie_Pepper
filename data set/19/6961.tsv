2007-11-03T14:35:00.000Z	moclobemide		i'm getting some strange behaviour, when i logout sometimes the computer screen just goes black and doesn't respond to anything, i end up having to turn power off manually
2007-11-03T14:36:00.000Z	Ziroday	moclobemide	can you post the output of lspci in pastebin please. You may be experiencing something known as a kernel panic. Does the num lock caps lock and scroll lock keys flash when this has happened?

2007-11-03T14:42:00.000Z	moclobemide	Ziroday	do you need the information to report a bug or to help me
2007-11-03T14:43:00.000Z	Ziroday	moclobemide	to help you am currently looking for any of your hardware that may have issues with ubuntu. Can I also have your dmesg output please

2007-11-03T14:46:00.000Z	Ziroday	moclobemide	do you have many externel usb or PCMCIA devices plugged into your computer often. Like a externel hdd or usb wireless modem?
2007-11-03T14:47:00.000Z	moclobemide	Ziroday	Nothing like that.
2007-11-03T14:47:00.000Z	moclobemide	Ziroday	It doesn't happen all the time, occasionally when i log off or ctrl alt backspace
2007-11-03T14:48:00.000Z	Ziroday	moclobemide	okay try the boot option "irqpoll" and hope it doesn't happen again. If it does than come back to #ubuntu
2007-11-03T14:49:00.000Z	moclobemide	Ziroday	what is irqpoll
2007-11-03T14:50:00.000Z	Ziroday	moclobemide	in your dmesg output there were some irq discovery errors. irqpoll will hopefully fix or stop the part of the system which handles IRQ entries and is messing up. It will not cause anything to be disabled that would hamper performance or anything else neccesary
2007-11-03T14:51:00.000Z	moclobemide	Ziroday	how do I set it so it runs
2007-11-03T14:52:00.000Z	Ziroday	moclobemide	you need to edit your menu.lst
2007-11-03T14:52:00.000Z	Ziroday	moclobemide	do you know how?
2007-11-03T14:52:00.000Z	moclobemide	Ziroday	I know how to edit it but not sure where it is located
