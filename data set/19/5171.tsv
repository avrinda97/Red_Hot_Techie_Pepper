2008-10-14T02:13:00.000Z	xomp	robelliott2125	I too have a Belkin Wifi adapter for my laptop and compared to windows my signal strength on windows is 95% good throughput, in linux it's 25% with low throughput.
2008-10-14T02:15:00.000Z	robelliott2125	xomp	, i've 100% signal, but transfering files between the pc downstairs (where the router is based) and ftp'ing from the net, is really slow.  Just wondering how to sort this out.  Any ideas?
2008-10-14T02:15:00.000Z	xomp	robelliott2125	I wouldn't trust what percentage the signal strength shows in ubuntu, I find it to be a lie.
2008-10-14T02:15:00.000Z	robelliott2125	xomp	, That side of things isn't the problem though
2008-10-14T02:16:00.000Z	robelliott2125		Its finding out why the transfer rate is so damned low xomp
2008-10-14T02:16:00.000Z	xomp	robelliott2125	I would say it is a problem if you're being informed incorrectly making you assume all is well, wouldn't you?
2008-10-14T02:16:00.000Z	robelliott2125	xomp	, i know its a problem, but I want a solution to this
2008-10-14T02:17:00.000Z	xomp	robelliott2125	signal strength should be relevant to transfer speeds, right?
2008-10-14T02:18:00.000Z	xomp	robelliott2125	me too :) believe me, I've spent plenty of time asking (both here & on the forums) and nobody has been able to assist with it. I guess there are too many variables that come into play with this kind of stuff :)
2008-10-14T02:18:00.000Z	robelliott2125		Don't know xomp, I know the router is below me, theres nothing which should degrade the transfer rate
2008-10-14T02:19:00.000Z	robelliott2125		Well, considering the dreded winblows is fine with the transfer rate, it seems to be ubuntu, some help should be given xomp
2008-10-14T02:19:00.000Z	robelliott2125	xomp	, i've just stumbled onto this:  http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-382817.html
2008-10-14T02:20:00.000Z	xomp	robelliott2125	yeah, I know, it's why I use Windows primarily on my laptop now and ubuntu on my desktop, maybe in the next 12 years someone can get the wifi right and all will be well :P
2008-10-14T02:20:00.000Z	robelliott2125		lol
2008-10-14T02:21:00.000Z	robelliott2125		But in the meantime, i've slow transfer when trying to use my damned pc.
2008-10-14T02:21:00.000Z	robelliott2125		Great...
2008-10-14T02:22:00.000Z	xomp	robelliott2125	there are 2 things that's killing (and will continue to kill) linux, 1.) Wireless Support 2.) Printer Support. Both are to say the very least lacking :/ Outside of that it's wonderful!
2008-10-14T02:54:00.000Z	robelliott2125	xomp	, you still here???
2008-10-14T02:57:00.000Z	robelliott2125	xomp	, give me a shout when your about...  Think i've solved the wifi bit
