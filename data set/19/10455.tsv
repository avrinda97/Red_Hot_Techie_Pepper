2006-12-18T09:40:00.000Z	jrib	Gosha	sedra: the wiki page should answer your questions.  If after reading it, something still isn't clear just ask
2007-01-07T11:57:00.000Z	jrib	Gosha	it only shows up if you install scripts
2007-01-07T11:59:00.000Z	jrib	Gosha	the scripts directory is ~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts/
2007-01-07T12:00:00.000Z	jrib	Gosha	because you are using gnome 2, that's where a lot of gnome-specific stuff goes
2007-09-08T11:41:00.000Z	jrib	Gosha	nohup or screen.  Or disown the job after you run it
2007-09-08T11:43:00.000Z	jrib	Gosha	to see what the & does try 'gedit &' vs 'gedit' (and try to use your terminal)
2007-09-16T06:19:00.000Z	jrib	Gosha	to search the contents of files
2007-09-16T06:22:00.000Z	jrib	Gosha	yep, | can pipe stdout of one program to stdin of another program, and grep reads from stdin and searches that too
2007-09-16T06:35:00.000Z	jrib	Gosha	head -n 1
