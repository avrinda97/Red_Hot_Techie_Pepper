2009-04-08T01:45:00.000Z	iamstupid		hi everyone - am having issues updating ubuntu because i've left it so long. I managed to sort out the fact that it couldn't download all repository indexes by changing my sources list. I have now done this and when I try to upgrade, I get an error message saying "No valid mirror found" - please can anyone help me?

2009-04-08T01:51:00.000Z	Picassotamus	iamstupid	Did you read the links from !upgrade?
2009-04-08T01:51:00.000Z	iamstupid	Picassotamus	?
2009-04-08T01:56:00.000Z	Picassotamus	iamstupid	Doesn't mean anything to you? /sigh What problem are you having specfically? Is upgrading to 8.04 not an option from Update Manager?
2009-04-08T01:59:00.000Z	iamstupid	Picassotamus	no because i need to update to 7.10 first
2009-04-08T02:01:00.000Z	Picassotamus	iamstupid	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/UpgradeFromOldVersion
2009-04-08T02:02:00.000Z	iamstupid	Picassotamus	is that seriously the only way?
2009-04-08T02:02:00.000Z	Picassotamus	iamstupid	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GutsyUpgrades <- how to get to 7.1 these are all from the links i sent you
2009-04-08T02:03:00.000Z	iamstupid	Picassotamus	i've already tried everything on that instruction page
2009-04-08T02:03:00.000Z	Picassotamus	iamstupid	I can't help you further unless there is a error message... I mean if you followed the instuctions w/o errors than it worked, right?
2009-04-08T02:04:00.000Z	iamstupid	Picassotamus	yes there were error messages - no valid mirror
2009-04-08T02:07:00.000Z	iamstupid	Picassotamus	thanks very much for all your help - i'm logging off but i'm going to keep trying. Am sure I'll be ok.
