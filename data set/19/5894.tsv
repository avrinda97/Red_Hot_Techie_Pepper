2008-04-25T21:32:00.000Z	tacone		why hardy optimization doesn't get applied to upgraded gutsies ? I still have /bin/sh -> bash, fstabs with no relatime and so on. Am I missing something ?

2008-04-25T21:35:00.000Z	pjoul	tacone	if you want improvements then upgrade to hardy
2008-04-25T21:35:00.000Z	tacone	pjoul	I did.
2008-04-25T21:35:00.000Z	pjoul	tacone	so why you ask?
2008-04-25T21:35:00.000Z	tacone	pjoul	I don't have that optimizations even after upgrading.
2008-04-25T21:35:00.000Z	tacone	pjoul	I am wondering why and if it's normal
2008-04-25T21:37:00.000Z	pjoul	tacone	my hardy: rwxrwxrwx 1 root root 4 2008-04-25 16:09 /bin/sh -> dash
2008-04-25T21:37:00.000Z	pjoul	tacone	in fstab everything with relatime
2008-04-25T21:38:00.000Z	tacone	pjoul	not for me. ok, thanks anyway
2008-04-25T21:38:00.000Z	pjoul	tacone	have you performed it with hardy final cd?
2008-04-25T21:38:00.000Z	pjoul	tacone	or via apt?
2008-04-25T21:38:00.000Z	tacone	pjoul	no, I upgraded via apt while it was in beta
2008-04-25T21:39:00.000Z	pjoul	tacone	this could be the issue
2008-04-25T21:39:00.000Z	tacone	pjoul	I am wondering if there's any way to reset to hardy defaults.
2008-04-25T21:39:00.000Z	tacone	pjoul	I can apply those things one by one, but I simply don't know all of them.
2008-04-25T21:39:00.000Z	pjoul	tacone	don't know, try to ask someone's interested
2008-04-25T21:40:00.000Z	tacone	pjoul	Thanks anyway
2008-04-25T21:40:00.000Z	pjoul	tacone	no problem
