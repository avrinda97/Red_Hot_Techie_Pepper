2005-12-27T07:09:00.000Z	QRZ	Delvien	 You can put your Nautilus scripts in ~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts and they'll be available via right-click from within Nautilus.
2005-12-27T07:10:00.000Z	Delvien	QRZ	/.gnome2 is not a directory it says
2005-12-27T07:10:00.000Z	QRZ	Delvien	 ~/.gnome2, not /.gnome2
2005-12-27T07:11:00.000Z	QRZ	Delvien	 Ubuntu seems to like ~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts though.
2005-12-27T07:13:00.000Z	Delvien	QRZ	what is a .sig file?
2005-12-27T07:14:00.000Z	QRZ	Delvien	 ...as in signature file perhaps?
2005-12-27T07:20:00.000Z	Delvien	QRZ	i downloaded this https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/audio-convert/, im trying to make it so i can have the "script" in there so i can can use it via right click
2005-12-27T07:21:00.000Z	QRZ	Delvien	 Ok.  So did it work?
2005-12-27T07:21:00.000Z	Delvien	QRZ	i dont know what kind of file do i need in there to be a "script"?
2005-12-27T07:22:00.000Z	QRZ	Delvien	 All you have to do is download and save it to a file in your ~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts directory and make sure it's executable (chmod 755 ~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts/name_of_script.sh).
2005-12-27T07:24:00.000Z	Delvien	QRZ	it worked
2005-12-27T07:25:00.000Z	QRZ	Delvien	 Cool!  I love the idea of nautilus scripts.  I've written several myself.  My latest is a virus scanner script for it.  It allows you to scan files/directories by right-clicking on them!
2005-12-27T07:26:00.000Z	Delvien	QRZ	cool is there any converts to PNG
2005-12-27T07:27:00.000Z	QRZ	Delvien	 Probably.  You could google for it and see.  If not, write one!  I'm currently working on a file encrypter/decrypter script for Nautilus.
2005-12-27T07:28:00.000Z	Delvien	QRZ	cool
2005-12-27T07:40:00.000Z	QRZ	Delvien	 Nice!  If you are interested in my virus scanner script for Nautilus, you can get it here ---> http://rob.pectol.com/myscripts/vscan  It requires Clam Anti-virus which can be easily gotten by doing, "sudo apt-get install clamav" at the command prompt.
2005-12-27T07:41:00.000Z	Delvien	QRZ	no thank you , i find clam to be a pain in my arse, i dont use a virus scanner hehe :)
2005-12-27T07:43:00.000Z	Delvien	QRZ	any idea how to look up a Konquror script so i may use that script for nautilus?
2005-12-27T07:44:00.000Z	QRZ	Delvien	 I wasn't aware that Konqueror had anything similar...
