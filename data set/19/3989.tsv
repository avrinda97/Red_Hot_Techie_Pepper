2010-09-05T04:03:00.000Z	Lxndr		Thunderbird hangs when I start it up. How can I make it stop hanging?
2010-09-05T04:03:00.000Z	usr13	Lxndr	Don't  know.  Run from terminal and see if you can tell what is hanging it up.
2010-09-05T04:05:00.000Z	Lxndr	usr13	running 'thunderbird' from the terminal starts it normal, and no messages are reported
2010-09-05T04:05:00.000Z	usr13	Lxndr	Must be that the menu item is pointing to wrong thing....
2010-09-05T04:06:00.000Z	Lxndr	usr13	But after the normal start, it still hangs.
2010-09-05T04:07:00.000Z	usr13	Lxndr	What does it say in the terminal?
2010-09-05T04:07:00.000Z	usr13	Lxndr	Any errors...?
2010-09-05T04:08:00.000Z	Lxndr	usr13	No errors. It's just quiet until I finally terminate it, at which point I just see 'terminated'
2010-09-05T04:09:00.000Z	usr13	Lxndr	So did thunderibrd load up and function ok?
2010-09-05T04:09:00.000Z	Lxndr	usr13	It functions for the first... 15 or so seconds, then it freezes.
2010-09-05T04:11:00.000Z	usr13	Lxndr	apt-get upgrade mozilla-thunderbird
2010-09-05T04:12:00.000Z	usr13	Lxndr	Ctrl-c does nothing?
2010-09-05T04:13:00.000Z	Lxndr	usr13	ctrl-c ends the process.
2010-09-05T04:13:00.000Z	usr13	Lxndr	sudo apt-get upgrade mozilla-thunderbird
2010-09-05T04:13:00.000Z	Lxndr	usr13	As for the upgrade, "0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded."

2010-09-05T04:18:00.000Z	Lxndr	usr13	That helped! Looks like it was a theme thing.
2010-09-05T04:19:00.000Z	usr13	Lxndr	aaaahhhh ok
2010-09-05T04:20:00.000Z	Lxndr	usr13	Hm, nevermind. It worked for a few seconds, and now is freezing again.
