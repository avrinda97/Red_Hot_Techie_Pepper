2009-03-22T01:27:00.000Z	user___	keithclark	theres no formatting needed, so no app needed
2009-03-22T01:27:00.000Z	keithclark	user___	ok, hmmm.  Not sure why it is not working then
2009-03-22T01:28:00.000Z	user___	keithclark	whats the error message?
2009-03-22T01:34:00.000Z	user___	keithclark	did you tell the burning program to burn on a cd or dvd (i once made that mistake myself, the program just wasnt capable of creating an image to burn on a dvd..)
2009-03-22T01:34:00.000Z	keithclark	user___	I'm using Brasero and it sees the correct drive
2009-03-22T01:35:00.000Z	user___	keithclark	do you choose to create a dvd data project?
2009-03-22T01:36:00.000Z	keithclark	user___	video project
2009-03-22T01:38:00.000Z	user___	keithclark	ah, so it might be that one of the parts for the dvd-image-composing-process is missing. could you start brasero from the command line with the "-vv" option? this would give us the chance to obtain more debug output
2009-03-22T01:40:00.000Z	keithclark	user___	will do
2009-03-22T01:43:00.000Z	keithclark	user___	unknown option -vv
2009-03-22T01:44:00.000Z	user___	keithclark	ok --debug is used by brasero as Jeruvy suggested
2009-03-22T01:51:00.000Z	user___	keithclark	line 155
2009-03-22T01:56:00.000Z	user___	keithclark	is package vcdimager installed?
2009-03-22T01:56:00.000Z	keithclark	user___	No, installing
2009-03-22T01:57:00.000Z	keithclark	user___	not sure how to use it though
2009-03-22T01:58:00.000Z	user___	keithclark	no need to worry for now, brasero should find it automatically
2009-03-22T01:59:00.000Z	user___	keithclark	also please do an  sudo aptitude install brasero    to get all recommended depencies installed
2009-03-22T02:04:00.000Z	keithclark	user___	done, still the same problem on both machiens
2009-03-22T02:06:00.000Z	user___	keithclark	the debug log shows what programs are still missing. just repeat step by step.
