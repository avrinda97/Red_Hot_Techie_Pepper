2006-10-24T08:27:00.000Z	WiseOdd		hi all. I need some help with my firewall.... dunno how to configure it decently...
2006-10-24T08:28:00.000Z	WiseOdd		any1 know anything about firewalls? I need some help....!
2006-10-24T08:30:00.000Z	WiseOdd		madcowboy: dunno how to configure my firewall properly... im running p2p, but i always seem to totally block everything instead of letting p2p apps go thru...
2006-10-24T08:31:00.000Z	WiseOdd		madcowboy: yup, with nat... but until i tried to configure "firestarter" everything was fine... now nothing works..
2006-10-24T08:32:00.000Z	WiseOdd		is there any firewall apps which would be more similar to windows based firewalls? i have no problem using them... :)
2006-10-24T08:33:00.000Z	WiseOdd		firewall in basic package in ubuntu...
2006-10-24T08:33:00.000Z	WiseOdd		im open to suggestions for other firewalls....
2006-10-24T08:33:00.000Z	rbil	WiseOdd	tell me what you need a firewall for
2006-10-24T08:36:00.000Z	WiseOdd	rbil	what about multiport  applications like most p2p programs?
2006-10-24T08:38:00.000Z	WiseOdd	rbil	thats why i thought a firewall would be a good idea...
2006-10-24T08:38:00.000Z	rbil	WiseOdd	you're still stuck in windowisms, imho
2006-10-24T08:39:00.000Z	WiseOdd	rbil	as i said, i just switched to linux... im figuring out things as they come, but im new to linux....
2006-10-24T08:39:00.000Z	WiseOdd	rbil	so yeah...
2006-10-24T08:40:00.000Z	rbil	WiseOdd	it wasn't a put down, I assure you.
2006-10-24T08:42:00.000Z	WiseOdd	rbil	i didnt really take it to be, but this is pretty hard for a newbie... There ARE many ways you have to adjust your thinking too...
2006-10-24T08:43:00.000Z	WiseOdd	rbil	but nevertheless, i like what i see, eventho i dont always understand whuts wut..
2006-10-24T08:43:00.000Z	rbil	WiseOdd	just that I see so many who have just entered the Linux world from windows, looking for anti-spam, anti-virus, defragging tools, etc. :-)
2006-10-24T08:45:00.000Z	WiseOdd	rbil	u only get smarter by asking questions... so u have to appear stupid once in a while, if u want to learn :)
2006-10-24T08:45:00.000Z	rbil	WiseOdd	I'm always learning, that is why I look so stupid :-)
