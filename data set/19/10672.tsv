2006-05-29T14:24:00.000Z	Schalken	Coag	yeah i got that far, if only it worked
2006-05-29T14:25:00.000Z	Schalken	Coag	well, the printer might have something to do with the lack of printer drivers, but the folder sharing should at least work
2006-05-29T14:25:00.000Z	Schalken	Coag	but its still asking for a password from the other computer
2006-05-29T14:26:00.000Z	Coag	Schalken	then passwd accountname
2006-05-29T14:27:00.000Z	Schalken	Coag	whatdya mean 'the same account as the windows box', i didnt know the windows box has an account
