2011-02-06T04:18:00.000Z	StepNjump		Hi guys, I installed Maverick on my Netbook. It's awsome! great job
2011-02-06T04:19:00.000Z	StepNjump		Is anyone familiar with the make command in bash?
2011-02-06T04:19:00.000Z	r000t_laptop	StepNjump	Under normal circumstances all you need to do is type make and then maybe sudo make install
2011-02-06T04:22:00.000Z	StepNjump	r000t_laptop	if you are looking at your public address, go to whatismyip.com
2011-02-06T04:23:00.000Z	r000t_laptop	StepNjump	That's the problem. All the other computers can connect to it's IP but I can't
2011-02-06T04:24:00.000Z	r000t_laptop	StepNjump	All computers are set for DHCP and I've tried with my wireless that has DMZ and I'm currently on ethernet
2011-02-06T04:25:00.000Z	StepNjump	r000t_laptop	so if you ping your router, do you get a reply?
2011-02-06T04:25:00.000Z	r000t_laptop	StepNjump	It fails instantly on all browsers. I get a "cannot connect" message from the browser before I even let go of the enter key
2011-02-06T04:25:00.000Z	r000t_laptop	StepNjump	Yes I always get a very fast ping reply
2011-02-06T04:26:00.000Z	r000t_laptop	StepNjump	This computer has been able to to it before for years.... and other computers can still do it
2011-02-06T04:27:00.000Z	r000t_laptop	StepNjump	Linksys WRT310N
2011-02-06T04:29:00.000Z	r000t_laptop	StepNjump	All websites I ping reply quickly. I can also access them
2011-02-06T04:29:00.000Z	StepNjump	r000t_laptop	maybe you could try to update your firmware but I doubt this will change anything
2011-02-06T04:29:00.000Z	r000t_laptop	StepNjump	How do I update the firmware if I can't get at the web interface?
2011-02-06T04:30:00.000Z	r000t_laptop	StepNjump	Yeah. Browsers won't load it so I can't get at it. Other computers do, however
2011-02-06T04:31:00.000Z	StepNjump	r000t_laptop	well, why don't u just use another computer to do your administrative work ?
2011-02-06T04:31:00.000Z	r000t_laptop	StepNjump	uk = ?
2011-02-06T04:32:00.000Z	r000t_laptop	StepNjump	Did you ./configure?
2011-02-06T04:44:00.000Z	StepNjump	r000t_laptop	any success?
