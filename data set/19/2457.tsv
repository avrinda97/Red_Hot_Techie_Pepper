2010-03-30T05:05:00.000Z	picard1421		im not relaly sure what i have to have in the hosts file ?
2010-03-30T05:05:00.000Z	picard1421		or resolv file?
2010-03-30T05:06:00.000Z	picard1421		ok what does the hosts file do?
2010-03-30T05:06:00.000Z	picard1421		no i understand.. but what does the resolv.conf and hosts file do .. what if i had them blank persay??
2010-03-30T05:07:00.000Z	picard1421		im confused why i need them and somewhat confused am i pointing them to an External IP or do i point them 127.0.0.1?
2010-03-30T05:07:00.000Z	picard1421		so like mysite.org should be in the hosts file? and pointed somewhere?
2010-03-30T05:08:00.000Z	picard1421		ok
2010-03-30T05:08:00.000Z	picard1421		so like i should have those pointed to like google's dns stuf etc..
2010-03-30T05:08:00.000Z	picard1421		and then in the hosts file i can have localhost and 127.0.0.1
2010-03-30T05:08:00.000Z	picard1421		and that is all i need?
2010-03-30T05:09:00.000Z	autobot	picard1421	say you wan't to ssh to a machine and you wan't to use a friendly name...it's good for that ie. 22.32.12.33 = mylinux.server
2010-03-30T05:09:00.000Z	autobot	picard1421	yes thats enough to get you by
2010-03-30T05:09:00.000Z	autobot	picard1421	not locally
2010-03-30T05:10:00.000Z	autobot	picard1421	like if your router's hostname is linbox.local you could point your browser to http://linbox.local and that would take you to your router
2010-03-30T05:17:00.000Z	autobot	picard1421	so you can run a webserver or similar on your machine and have your IP resolve to a name
2010-03-30T05:21:00.000Z	autobot	picard1421	what is it your trying to do?
2010-03-30T05:23:00.000Z	autobot	picard1421	I suppose it's not a supported redirector
2010-03-30T05:23:00.000Z	autobot	picard1421	looking
2010-03-30T05:24:00.000Z	autobot	picard1421	the example namecheap configuration not getting you there
