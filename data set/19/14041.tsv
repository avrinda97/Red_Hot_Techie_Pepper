2004-12-02T17:36:00.000Z	eim		Hello folks, I'm currently installing Warty on my x86 workstation -- I own an 80GB IDE HDD and I'm planing how to partition the fs. Which size should be the /boot partition? ~40MB? Thanks.
2004-12-02T17:36:00.000Z	eim		I think also 20MB for /boot should suffice.
2004-12-02T17:38:00.000Z	mirak	eim	when we had only 128 meg of ram or even 64 yes
2004-12-02T17:38:00.000Z	eim	mirak	unison is what I use to sync my home.
2004-12-02T17:38:00.000Z	mirak	eim	but if you have 1G of ram you will not use 2G of swap :
2004-12-02T17:38:00.000Z	mirak	eim	thanks I check that
2004-12-02T17:38:00.000Z	eim	mirak	I have 512MB of RAM so 1024 of SWAP should be ok, IMHO.
2004-12-02T17:38:00.000Z	mirak	eim	is it possible to use it with cron ?
2004-12-02T17:39:00.000Z	eim	mirak	Sure, it's a CLI tool.
2004-12-02T17:39:00.000Z	mirak	eim	that's to much I think
2004-12-02T17:39:00.000Z	eim	mirak	I'm away. We'll continue discussion later.
2004-12-02T17:39:00.000Z	mirak	eim	I mean 1G of swap is for using oracle or uge servers I think
2004-12-02T17:39:00.000Z	mirak	eim	bye
2004-12-02T10:34:00.000Z	eim	mirak	And? unison works fine?
2004-12-02T10:55:00.000Z	mirak	eim	I realised that unisson must be installed on both side, unfortunely I don't own the root rights on the other side (and the admin is a loser)
2004-12-02T10:56:00.000Z	eim	mirak	You cold eventually compile it from source and install in ~/bin
2004-12-02T10:56:00.000Z	mirak	eim	I will try to do a user install
2004-12-02T10:56:00.000Z	eim	mirak	As far as you're in any case only syncing user-files and user-level running unison session should suffice.
