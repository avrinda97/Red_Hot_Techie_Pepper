2005-02-18T17:41:00.000Z	hummm		can someone please tell me why i cant switch back to X from a different tty? :/
2005-02-18T17:41:00.000Z	hummm		i have to brute force my computer down from power button :/
2005-02-18T17:42:00.000Z	crimsun	hummm	alt+f7 doesn't work?
2005-02-18T17:42:00.000Z	hummm	crimsun	it works once
2005-02-18T17:42:00.000Z	crimsun	hummm	are you using the binary-only "nvidia" driver?
2005-02-18T17:42:00.000Z	hummm	crimsun	nvidia driver yeah
2005-02-18T17:42:00.000Z	crimsun	hummm	then that's a known issue.
2005-02-18T17:42:00.000Z	hummm	crimsun	how to fix it?
2005-02-18T17:43:00.000Z	hummm	crimsun	oh crap :/
2005-02-18T17:45:00.000Z	hummm	crimsun	would it help if i just disable gettys from /etc/inittab?
2005-02-18T17:45:00.000Z	crimsun	hummm	no
2005-02-18T17:45:00.000Z	hummm	crimsun	but at least i would not be able to accidentally swith to another getty..
2005-02-18T17:49:00.000Z	hummm	crimsun	ok, well thanks for the info
2005-02-19T10:52:00.000Z	crimsun	hummm	what sort of file is .fluxrc?
2005-02-19T10:52:00.000Z	crimsun	hummm	is it specific to fluxbox (e.g., read only on fluxbox execution)?
2005-02-19T10:53:00.000Z	hummm	crimsun	yeah, i just set my background there and x keymap and start gnome-settings-daemon
2005-02-19T10:53:00.000Z	crimsun	hummm	doesn't fluxbox provide functionality to parse such a file on initial execution regardless?
2005-02-19T10:54:00.000Z	hummm	crimsun	i have been reading the flux manual quite a lot lately. i'll check it again.
2005-02-19T11:09:00.000Z	hummm	crimsun	cant find anything
