2008-03-11T11:54:00.000Z	Lartza_		I found good tut how to configure fluxbox, thanks to you.
2008-03-11T11:54:00.000Z	Lartza_		How much does ubuntu install take?
2008-03-11T11:55:00.000Z	Lartza_		And what would be good hdd format when ubuntu windows shared?
2008-03-11T11:55:00.000Z	slytherin	Lartza_	default desktop install is around 2 GB. You should find requirements in the documentation on CD
2008-03-11T11:57:00.000Z	slytherin	Lartza_	please don't install Ubuntu on fat32. You will face problems later
2008-03-11T11:58:00.000Z	slytherin	Lartza_	yes, fat32 is always better as shared hd
2008-03-11T12:00:00.000Z	slytherin	Lartza_	yes
2008-03-11T12:02:00.000Z	slytherin	Lartza_	that is enough for Ubuntu. I will not talk about XP. :-P
2008-03-11T12:05:00.000Z	slytherin	Lartza_	yes, don't use livecd for old systems. use alternate cd.
2008-03-11T12:05:00.000Z	slytherin	Lartza_	and you may also want to try xfce desktop in case gnome is too slow on your machine
2008-03-11T12:05:00.000Z	Lartza_	slytherin	I installed fluxbox to it
2008-03-11T12:06:00.000Z	slytherin	Lartza_	you installed fluxbox and you call yourself noob?
2008-03-11T12:08:00.000Z	slytherin	Lartza_	what I mean is 'noobs don't know what fluxbox is'. :-) And since you have used Debian at some point of time Ubuntu should not be too difficult to you
2008-03-11T12:09:00.000Z	slytherin	Lartza_	Oh, Since you were asking about dual boot Ithought it was your first time
2008-03-11T12:09:00.000Z	Lartza_	slytherin	First time with dualboot :D
2008-03-11T12:16:00.000Z	slytherin	Lartza_	it is Free but not free AFAIK
