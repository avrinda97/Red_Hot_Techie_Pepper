2007-12-31T10:13:00.000Z	jburd		WTF is wrong with Ubuntu?  Why is it giving me such a hard time?  It just doesn't work.
2007-12-31T10:13:00.000Z	jburd		I've reinstalled this shit way too many times now and I'm losing patience.
2007-12-31T10:14:00.000Z	jburd		It was working fine just this time and then boom.  gnome-settings-daemon cannot start.  WTF is all this?  It doesn't work on a fresh installation.
2007-12-31T10:15:00.000Z	jburd		And this is a brand new /Dell/ laptop which is supposed to run Ubuntu flawlessly.
2007-12-31T10:16:00.000Z	jburd		How do I manually start 'gnome-settings-daemon'?
2007-12-31T10:17:00.000Z	jburd		The GNOME user interface looks pathetic at the moment.
2007-12-31T10:18:00.000Z	jburd		I did that.
2007-12-31T10:19:00.000Z	jburd		A Dell laptop has given me the /toughest/ time installing Ubuntu on it.
2007-12-31T10:20:00.000Z	jburd		1.  Installing NetworkManager disables my keyboard.   2.  Enabling compiz crashes GNOME   3. I can't install anything using apt because dpkg --configure -a needs to be run.  4. dpkg --configure -a doesn't want to finish successfully with fixing the problem.  So I'm stuck in a rut.
2007-12-31T10:21:00.000Z	jburd		This is the last f time I'm going to try Ubuntu on this laptop.  After that I'll just dump it into the trash can and install Vista back on it.
2007-12-31T10:21:00.000Z	truna	jburd	can you dump the laptop too, i will pick it up :)
2007-12-31T10:22:00.000Z	jburd	truna	It's not mine.  I was helping someone migrate to Linux and now the sword is on my throat.
2007-12-31T10:24:00.000Z	truna	jburd	which ubuntu version you downloaded? did you burn it a low speed?
2007-12-31T10:25:00.000Z	jburd	truna	Yes, I did burn it at low speed, 24 X to be precise.  It's Gutsy Gibbon
2007-12-31T10:25:00.000Z	truna	jburd	low speed is more like 1x or 2x..not anything above that..somehow they fail if burn at higher speeds..as my experience so far
2007-12-31T10:26:00.000Z	jburd	truna	The burn succeeded.
2007-12-31T10:26:00.000Z	truna	jburd	as an option when burning, verify data?
2007-12-31T10:27:00.000Z	jburd	truna	And I'm doing a "Check CD for defects" now
2007-12-31T10:33:00.000Z	jburd	truna	Integrity check successful.
