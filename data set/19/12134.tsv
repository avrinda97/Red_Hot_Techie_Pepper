2006-01-10T10:07:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	jeff_ii	intelikey: I was hoping all of them, but I'm ignorant like that.  So far I've been using it in XChat, Firefox, and gnome-terminal.
2006-01-10T10:08:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	jeff_ii	Do you know where I would change it if it is an X thing?
2006-01-10T10:08:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	jeff_ii	(Well, I suppose xorg.conf somewhere, but where in / how?)
2006-01-10T10:12:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	jeff_ii	I found the mouse section in xorg.conf, but don't know how I would modify it.  Is there a guide to dealing with this file somewhere?
2006-01-10T10:44:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	jeff_ii	I do indeed have ZAxisMapping  4 5.
2006-01-10T10:45:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	jeff_ii	Where did you get this answer?
2006-01-10T10:47:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	jeff_ii	Not every app has configurations for that though.  Do I just have to tough it out for those, or do the 4 5 mean something along the lines of a default to use in that situation?  (Checking out the link now.)
2006-01-10T10:48:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	jeff_ii	Ah, missing the l at the end.  We're good now.
2006-01-10T11:00:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	jeff_ii	Apparently not.
