2010-02-26T18:57:00.000Z	pngll		Hi, I just installed Ubuntu 9.10 with wubi over an old windows7 partition and now when I select Ubuntu at the boot menu I get to the GRUB command line. Btw, Windows 7 is still in the boot options but obviously doesn't work anymore.

2010-02-26T18:58:00.000Z	gartral	pngll	were you hoping to keep that windows installation?
2010-02-26T18:59:00.000Z	pngll	gartral	nope, I formatted the partition before using wubi anyways.
2010-02-26T18:59:00.000Z	gartral	pngll	well thats a problem, as wubi installed ubuntu into a page file (of sorts) insode the windows partition.. you just nuked everything
2010-02-26T19:00:00.000Z	pngll	gartral	I'm not too worried, I still have access to my windows vista partition (using it right now)
2010-02-26T19:02:00.000Z	gartral	pngll	ok, in control panel, look for Administration tools, and Disk Manager
2010-02-26T19:02:00.000Z	pngll	gartral	got it
2010-02-26T19:02:00.000Z	pngll	gartral	what do i do now
2010-02-26T19:02:00.000Z	gartral	pngll	remove just the win 7, as your ubuntu install will be fixe by installing ubuntu the normal way (or wubi again, if you prefer)
2010-02-26T19:04:00.000Z	gartral	pngll	you should have an MBR tool somewhere in the lists of tools
2010-02-26T19:07:00.000Z	pngll	gartral	there's no windows7 partition that i can delete. Here's a screenshot: http://imgur.com/iNW6L.png
2010-02-26T19:09:00.000Z	gartral	pngll	ewww. .i cant understand your language man. your looking for Master Boot Record
2010-02-26T19:11:00.000Z	pngll	gartral	ouch. I don't see anything that looks like MBR. I'll try rebooting and look again for any specific error message.
2010-02-26T19:11:00.000Z	pngll	gartral	be back in a bit
2010-02-26T19:19:00.000Z	gartral	pngll	repeat please
2010-02-26T19:25:00.000Z	pngll	gartral	hmm things didn't improve. I removed windows 7 from the boot options, and for some reason I now have to manually tell the BIOS which hard drive to boot from. Also I didn't see anything special on the GRUB CLI, but when I enter the command "boot" it tells me "no kernel loaded".
2010-02-26T19:26:00.000Z	gartral	pngll	ok, no, your situation has improved marginally, now you need to reinstall ubuntu again, this time from the graphical installer with the disk in the drive at boot
2010-02-26T19:28:00.000Z	pngll	gartral	ok, I'll burn a live cd and move on from here.
