2010-06-22T06:53:00.000Z	bkadoctaj		Would someone please take a look at the Desktop context section of my rc.xml for Openbox? http://pastebin.com/ZBsXxtYn  I can't get the mouse binding to work with the VolumeNotify.sh script at the bottom.  :(
2010-06-22T06:53:00.000Z	hoverbear1	bkadoctaj	Does it work if you toss it in quotes?
2010-06-22T06:53:00.000Z	bkadoctaj		Hmm, haven't tried that, hoverbear1.
2010-06-22T06:53:00.000Z	hoverbear1	bkadoctaj	"/home/jason/.scripts/VolumeNotify.sh up"
2010-06-22T06:54:00.000Z	bkadoctaj	hoverbear1	nope.  :(
2010-06-22T06:54:00.000Z	hoverbear1	bkadoctaj	is the script +x?
2010-06-22T06:55:00.000Z	bkadoctaj	hoverbear1	I have checked it out in the terminal, and yep, it's executable and fully functional.
2010-06-22T06:55:00.000Z	hoverbear1	bkadoctaj	Interesting.
2010-06-22T06:55:00.000Z	bkadoctaj		lol Yeah, I was thinking it was just me...
2010-06-22T06:56:00.000Z	bkadoctaj	hoverbear1	I've also tried it with C and A instead of W.  No luck.
2010-06-22T06:56:00.000Z	hoverbear1	bkadoctaj	Does it work if you substitute the command for like, firefox or whatever?
2010-06-22T06:57:00.000Z	hoverbear1	bkadoctaj	I'
2010-06-22T06:57:00.000Z	hoverbear1	bkadoctaj	I'm curious if it's the command, or the keybind.
2010-06-22T06:57:00.000Z	bkadoctaj	hoverbear1	aha, no that mousebind doesn't work either.
2010-06-22T06:58:00.000Z	hoverbear1	bkadoctaj	Then it's the mousebind not the exec :)
2010-06-22T06:58:00.000Z	bkadoctaj	hoverbear1	well, how is my syntax any different from the default command to move to the previous desktop?
2010-06-22T06:59:00.000Z	hoverbear1	bkadoctaj	I have no idea. :S I don't use openbox.
2010-06-22T06:59:00.000Z	bkadoctaj	hoverbear1	ah, okay.  :)  Well, thanks for helping.  I guess there's something about the Execute action...
2010-06-22T07:00:00.000Z	hoverbear1	bkadoctaj	It's entirely plausible.
