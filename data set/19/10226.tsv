2006-07-10T12:20:00.000Z	synd2		Hi. I'm having internet oddities..
2006-07-10T12:20:00.000Z	synd2		Firefox is acting weird, connecting fine to some things, and hanging at others
2006-07-10T12:20:00.000Z	Dragonfyre13	synd2	what exactly?
2006-07-10T12:21:00.000Z	synd2	Dragonfyre13	Just general browsing
2006-07-10T12:23:00.000Z	Dragonfyre13	synd2	can you be more specific about the hanging?
2006-07-10T12:23:00.000Z	synd2	Dragonfyre13	It just sits there saying "connecting to.."
2006-07-10T12:24:00.000Z	Dragonfyre13	synd2	try using opera or links and see if it does the same thing. Also, are you on broadband, if so what kind.
2006-07-10T12:24:00.000Z	synd2	Dragonfyre13	I noticed it timing out on things when I apt-get update
2006-07-10T12:25:00.000Z	synd2	Dragonfyre13	Then those same things would connect fine a few secs later
2006-07-10T12:25:00.000Z	synd2	Dragonfyre13	I'm on cable
2006-07-10T12:25:00.000Z	Dragonfyre13	synd2	do you have a router?
2006-07-10T12:25:00.000Z	synd2	Dragonfyre13	WRT54G
2006-07-10T12:26:00.000Z	synd2	Dragonfyre13	I tried surfing from a roommate's XP machine and it doesn't hang
2006-07-10T12:26:00.000Z	Dragonfyre13	synd2	cycle the router, and the cable modem.
2006-07-10T12:26:00.000Z	synd2	Dragonfyre13	Did that :)
2006-07-10T12:26:00.000Z	Dragonfyre13	synd2	also, what programs are you running that access the network, internet or otherwise.
2006-07-10T12:27:00.000Z	synd2	Dragonfyre13	XMMS is connected to a stream and it's going fine
2006-07-10T12:27:00.000Z	synd2	Dragonfyre13	And I'm connected to IRC via X-Chat
