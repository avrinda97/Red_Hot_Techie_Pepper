2009-09-07T06:34:00.000Z	MadSeaDog		anyway to batch change one line in 20 text file in a single command?
2009-09-07T06:35:00.000Z	prince_jammys	MadSeaDog	by line number, by text pattern ... how?
2009-09-07T06:37:00.000Z	MadSeaDog	prince_jammys	 let go with boths... for futurs uses... but text pattern will do the job...
2009-09-07T06:38:00.000Z	prince_jammys	MadSeaDog	well, it's best of you tell me specifics, since the approach changes depending on the requirements. What text pattern?
2009-09-07T06:39:00.000Z	MadSeaDog	prince_jammys	 a path ... something like /home/blahblah/moreblahblah/ to /somethingelse/blahblah/moreblahblah ...
2009-09-07T06:40:00.000Z	prince_jammys	MadSeaDog	sed -i 's:/home/blahblah/moreblah/:/somethingelse/blah:g'  fileone filetwo filethree ....
2009-09-07T06:40:00.000Z	prince_jammys	MadSeaDog	do the twenty filenames have something in common that distinguishes them from the other files in the dir ?
2009-09-07T06:55:00.000Z	MadSeaDog	prince_jammys	 ok  thanks for the hint...
2009-09-07T06:41:00.000Z	prince_jammys	MadSeaDog	make backups before you test this. it'll overwrite the files.
2009-09-07T06:41:00.000Z	MadSeaDog	prince_jammys	 yeah gonna change the end with *.something ...
2009-09-07T06:41:00.000Z	MadSeaDog	prince_jammys	 i dont need the old files after...
2009-09-07T06:41:00.000Z	prince_jammys	MadSeaDog	then sed -i sameasabove  *.something
2009-09-07T06:42:00.000Z	MadSeaDog	prince_jammys	 ok thanks gonna try it now...
2009-09-07T06:42:00.000Z	prince_jammys	MadSeaDog	yes, but still. make backups to make sure the substitution is done how you want.
2009-09-07T06:43:00.000Z	prince_jammys	MadSeaDog	that will not change entire lines. it'll just substitute one string for the other, everywhere.
2009-09-07T06:50:00.000Z	MadSeaDog	prince_jammys	 worked great!
2009-09-07T06:50:00.000Z	prince_jammys	MadSeaDog	good.
2009-09-07T06:51:00.000Z	prince_jammys	MadSeaDog	if you'd like to understand how to use sed, /join #sed and read the guide in the channel topic.
2009-10-19T10:20:00.000Z	prince_jammys	MadSeaDog	pokerstars works under wine.
