2005-10-27T08:40:00.000Z	axisys__1	Servo888	is there a howto on dvd::rip
2005-10-27T08:40:00.000Z	axisys__1	Servo888	i noticed i have it installed but don't seem to work
2005-10-27T08:40:00.000Z	Servo888	axisys__1	you install it and you run it. You may need decss if you want to decrypt an encrypted dvd.
2005-10-27T08:41:00.000Z	Servo888	axisys__1	what's your error message?
2005-10-27T08:41:00.000Z	axisys__1	Servo888	first of all it says open project
2005-10-27T08:41:00.000Z	axisys__1	Servo888	i guess i need a howto first
2005-10-27T08:41:00.000Z	Servo888	axisys__1	how to use the software or how to install it?
2005-10-27T08:42:00.000Z	axisys__1	Servo888	i already have it installed
2005-10-27T08:42:00.000Z	Servo888	axisys__1	just go to their website at: http://www.exit1.org/dvdrip/
2005-10-27T08:43:00.000Z	Servo888	axisys__1	they have a 'how to use the gui' section so that should get you started.
2005-10-27T09:44:00.000Z	axisys__1	Servo888	dvd::rip does not fit in my laptop screen .. can't resize it
2005-10-27T09:44:00.000Z	Servo888	axisys__1	that's strange...
2005-10-27T09:44:00.000Z	axisys__1	Servo888	when i try to open new project
2005-10-27T09:44:00.000Z	axisys__1	Servo888	it shows the top but not sure what in the bottom
2005-10-27T09:45:00.000Z	Servo888	axisys__1	you could run a virtual desktop, of say 1280x1024 resolution on a smaller resolution screen - that will allow you to see the entire program
2005-10-27T09:46:00.000Z	axisys__1	Servo888	hmmm sorry not sure how to do that
2005-10-27T09:47:00.000Z	Servo888	axisys__1	it would be done by editing the xorg.conf file, but I'm sure what ever ubuntu's configuration editor is - it should do it for you.
