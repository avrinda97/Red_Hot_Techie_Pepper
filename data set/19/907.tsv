2011-07-23T16:49:00.000Z	coz_	ionite	 it is pretty self expanatory,, is it opened?
2011-08-02T17:48:00.000Z	coz_	ionite	  what ghz  is your P4?
2011-08-02T17:48:00.000Z	ionite	coz_	3.0
2011-08-02T17:48:00.000Z	coz_	ionite	  ok that should be fine,, I am running a 2.8  on this system...
2011-08-02T17:49:00.000Z	coz_	ionite	  open a terminal and paste this command      lspci | grep -i vga
2011-08-02T17:50:00.000Z	ionite	coz_	GirlyGirl : ThinkT510 : dr_willis : I just want something that's not buggy like my current GNOME/UNITY ubuntu, it's snappy and run a exe file.
2011-08-02T17:51:00.000Z	coz_	ionite	  I am sure its been suggested that you could just log into the classic session
2011-08-02T17:52:00.000Z	coz_	ionite	 out of curiosity,, open a terminal     type or copy paste this command      lspci | grep -i vga
2011-08-02T17:52:00.000Z	ionite	coz_	00:06.0 VGA compatible controller: nVidia Corporation NV34 [GeForce FX 5500] (rev a1) 01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: S3 Inc. VT8375 [ProSavage8 KM266/KL266]
2011-08-02T17:52:00.000Z	coz_	ionite	 ok the fx5500  is most likely what is giving you issues
2011-08-02T17:53:00.000Z	ionite	coz_	 dr_willis GirlyGirl  ThinkT510 schnuffle: i've only got a 256MB graphics. so any recommendations?
2011-08-02T17:53:00.000Z	coz_	ionite	   you could log into classic, or as already suggested ,  install xubuntu-desktop and log into that
2011-08-02T17:53:00.000Z	ionite	coz_	yes u still rem the fx5500!!! amazing.
2011-08-02T17:54:00.000Z	coz_	ionite	  I have one  sitting around here somewhere :)
2011-08-02T17:54:00.000Z	ionite	coz_	 i was so frustrated with my FX5500. anyways, now i'm frustrated with the buggy banshee in UNITY and the delay even browsing from tab to tab.
2011-08-02T17:55:00.000Z	coz_	ionite	 well yes an fx card may not be able to handle Unity's  interface well
2011-08-02T17:56:00.000Z	coz_	ionite	 since compiz is running that,, you may have to disable some of the plugins in compiz  to get to a "decent" working environment
2011-08-02T17:57:00.000Z	coz_	ionite	  you could also install unity2d and switch to that,, it will look nearly the same
