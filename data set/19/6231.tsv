2008-10-02T13:07:00.000Z	moza		it's really getting weird! my folders show nothing inside them, although just one second ago, i was accessing files within them...
2008-10-02T13:08:00.000Z	moza		does somebody know what fspot is?
2008-10-02T13:08:00.000Z	jim_p	moza	fspot is an image managing program. it makes databases of your images, albums and stuff
2008-10-02T13:09:00.000Z	jim_p	moza	no
2008-10-02T13:14:00.000Z	jim_p	moza	i know that several cardreaders built in on laptops dont work *_for certain type of cards_*
2008-10-02T13:14:00.000Z	jim_p	moza	eg they dont recognise xd cards, although they accept them
2008-10-02T13:15:00.000Z	moza	jim_p	: is there any forum/site about these problems with sd-cards?
2008-10-02T13:16:00.000Z	jim_p	moza	the gentoo wiki just lists what works and what not
2008-10-02T13:17:00.000Z	moza	jim_p	ok, i'll try that to see at least in what category is my card
2008-10-02T13:18:00.000Z	jim_p	moza	you siad its an SD!
2008-10-02T13:18:00.000Z	moza	jim_p	yes i said that, is there something i didn't get?
2008-10-02T13:19:00.000Z	jim_p	moza	if it works with one SD card, it will work with all SD cards
2008-10-02T13:19:00.000Z	jim_p	moza	let me find an example
2008-10-02T13:20:00.000Z	moza	jim_p	ok, i only have one SD card, it worked once or twice, but most of the time it doesn't
2008-10-02T13:20:00.000Z	jim_p	moza	http://gentoo-wiki.com/HP_Pavilion_dv6850el scroll down and look at a table with the laptops specifications and what works
2008-10-02T13:26:00.000Z	moza	jim_p	: ok, i checked on the page. it seems the sd card reader is supported on other laptops and was not tested on mine on this wiki
2008-10-02T13:27:00.000Z	jim_p	moza	give me a sec please
2008-10-02T13:28:00.000Z	moza	jim_p	: sorry, take your time, there is no rush
2008-10-03T19:58:00.000Z	moza	jim_p	or any other else : i have this problem with sd-cards on my laptop
