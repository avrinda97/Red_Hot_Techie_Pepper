2008-01-21T22:12:00.000Z	alexvd_		Anyone run intel graphics card with Compiz
2008-01-21T22:13:00.000Z	alexvd_		Ok I have intel 855Gm I ran compiz no problems then enabled dual screens
2008-01-21T22:14:00.000Z	crdlb	alexvd_	an i855 isn't nearly powerful enough to drive compiz on two screens, and there's a hardware limit holding you to 2048x2048 in total resolution
2008-01-21T22:16:00.000Z	alexvd_	crdlb	yes I know that i run into the total 2048 limit.  However that is not my issue.  My issue is now whenever I run Compiz i get a third of the screen chopped off vertically
2008-01-21T22:16:00.000Z	crdlb	alexvd_	you only see the top left 640x480?
2008-01-21T22:17:00.000Z	alexvd_	crdlb	 No I have the 1024x768 screen but the right portion is black. I can see click on items behind it
2008-01-21T22:18:00.000Z	crdlb	alexvd_	I mean what is the size of the part of the screen you can *see* ?
2008-01-21T22:18:00.000Z	crdlb	alexvd_	is it about 640x480 ?
2008-01-21T22:18:00.000Z	alexvd_	crdlb	I guess that is probably close to that
2008-01-21T22:18:00.000Z	alexvd_	crdlb	no way to measure
2008-01-21T22:19:00.000Z	crdlb	alexvd_	ok then I know what happened, open ccsm and go to General Options > Display Settings, and check Detect Outputs
2008-01-21T22:19:00.000Z	alexvd_	crdlb	Ok doing that now
2008-01-21T22:21:00.000Z	alexvd_	crdlb	hot diggity dam that worked.  You guys dont suck!!!!
2008-01-21T22:23:00.000Z	alexvd_	crdlb	should I be concerned that when running compiz from terminal I see it fails the check for texture_from_pixmap and the tries with indirect rendering.  Isnt indirect rendering slower?
2008-01-21T22:23:00.000Z	crdlb	alexvd_	it's accelerated indirect rendering (AIGLX), completely normal
2008-01-21T22:24:00.000Z	alexvd_	crdlb	thanks again
2008-01-21T22:25:00.000Z	alexvd_	crdlb	I am running awn for dock.  Do you know how to enable the hack to speed up the hide?
2008-01-21T22:25:00.000Z	crdlb	alexvd_	I don't, there's an #awn channel on freenode though
2008-01-21T22:25:00.000Z	alexvd_	crdlb	heading over cool bean
