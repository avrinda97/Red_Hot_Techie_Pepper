2012-05-27T13:45:00.000Z	xisor		im on 12.04 and i have AMD drivers on 3.2.0-24
2012-05-27T13:45:00.000Z	xisor		so whoever told you that was apparently wrong
2012-05-27T13:46:00.000Z	xisor		60fps in tuxracer and 1900fps in glxgears confirms it
2012-05-27T13:46:00.000Z	xisor		no way this cpu can manage that without acceleration
2012-05-27T13:46:00.000Z	xisor		so my ati driver is working fine on 3.2 kernel
2012-05-27T13:46:00.000Z	IronSight	xisor	you have a sandybridge?
2012-05-27T13:47:00.000Z	xisor	IronSight	i do but linux isnt on it, its on an amd athlon II dual core 2ghz
2012-05-27T13:47:00.000Z	xisor	IronSight	no way it has that kind of power ;)
2012-05-27T13:49:00.000Z	xisor	IronSight	sandy bridge 6 core on my gaming pc, not going to bother installing linux on it, i dont do anything in linux that requires that kind of power
2012-05-27T13:49:00.000Z	IronSight	xisor	compiling?
2012-05-27T13:50:00.000Z	xisor	IronSight	this is my first day using linux IronSight  so nope :P
2012-05-27T13:51:00.000Z	IronSight	xisor	oh, well, if you ever get into compiling apps, that 6 core would be very useful ^_^ use make -j13
2012-05-27T13:51:00.000Z	xisor	IronSight	what does that flag do? specify number of threads?
2012-05-27T13:52:00.000Z	IronSight	xisor	indeed
2012-05-27T13:52:00.000Z	xisor	IronSight	why 13 threads on a 12 thread cpu?
2012-05-27T13:52:00.000Z	xisor	IronSight	typo? :P
2012-05-27T13:52:00.000Z	IronSight	xisor	no, that's the formula for that flag, threads + 1
2012-05-27T13:53:00.000Z	xisor	IronSight	bigger question is, what the heck could i compile that wouldnt be don nearly instantly on that cpu? :P
2012-05-27T13:53:00.000Z	IronSight	xisor	many game engines, and the kernel of course :)
