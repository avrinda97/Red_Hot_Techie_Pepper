2011-09-08T00:03:00.000Z	thomasj73		Hi everyone
2011-09-08T00:03:00.000Z	thomasj73		Hate being the new guy but I think I messed something up
2011-09-08T00:03:00.000Z	thomasj73		I keep seeing stuff online about swap but when I set my system up, i didn't set up swap
2011-09-08T00:03:00.000Z	thomasj73		is that bad?
2011-09-08T00:04:00.000Z	thomasj73		Is it too late to add swap after I've already installed Ubuntu?
2011-09-08T00:04:00.000Z	share	thomasj73	no, make space and create the partition
2011-09-08T00:05:00.000Z	thomasj73	share	mkswap?
2011-09-08T00:05:00.000Z	share	thomasj73	the only problem is that you could lose files while resizing if disc is fragmented
2011-09-08T00:06:00.000Z	share	thomasj73	boot from livecd and then use gparted. i think you can do that
2011-09-08T00:07:00.000Z	share	thomasj73	administration > system monitor File Systems tab :)
2011-09-08T00:08:00.000Z	thomasj73	share	nope, no swap :(  sudo fdisk -l: /dev/sdb1   *           1        7296    58603520   83  Linux
2011-09-08T00:09:00.000Z	share	thomasj73	do you really need swap? are you gonna hibernate your computer?
2011-09-08T00:09:00.000Z	thomasj73	share	I don't think I do
2011-09-08T00:09:00.000Z	thomasj73	share	nope
2011-09-08T00:09:00.000Z	share	thomasj73	so you are fine.
2011-09-08T00:10:00.000Z	share	thomasj73	do you know what swap is?
2011-09-08T00:10:00.000Z	thomasj73	share	space on the hdd to stash sleeping apps until needed to be brought back into memory?
2011-09-08T00:11:00.000Z	thomasj73	share	Memory: 307MiB of 1.7GiB Swap: 0 of 0
2011-09-08T00:12:00.000Z	thomasj73	share	So by the looks of things, I don't need to worry about swap then?
