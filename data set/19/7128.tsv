2007-11-04T07:05:00.000Z	koshari_		pwnt in what application?
2007-11-04T07:05:00.000Z	pwnt-	koshari_	I tried everything.
2007-11-04T07:06:00.000Z	pwnt-	koshari_	when i plug it into the usb, it pop something saying "Webcam has been detected" but then it doesn't be able to check the images in it. and then all applications can't find it because it cannot open /dev/video0
2007-11-04T07:06:00.000Z	koshari_		pwnt does it work in egiga?
2007-11-04T07:07:00.000Z	pwnt-	koshari_	no. maybe I need to install driver for the webcam first?
2007-11-04T07:08:00.000Z	koshari_		pwnt it would depend on your webcam, can you look in harware properties and find out the type of cam?
2007-11-04T07:09:00.000Z	pwnt-	koshari_	it's intel usb wecam
2007-11-04T07:09:00.000Z	koshari_		pwnt, i tried a sonic twinklecam and it just wouldnt work, however my laptops logitec ormicam works out of the box
2007-11-04T07:10:00.000Z	koshari_		pwnt you may need to load a module for it, i dont know what module the intel cams use,
2007-11-04T07:11:00.000Z	pwnt-	koshari_	okay. I don't know what to do either
