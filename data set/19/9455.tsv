2010-06-30T03:00:00.000Z	Dulak		ext4 needs another 5-10 years to mature before I'd use it in production
2010-06-30T03:01:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Dulak	So I assume you won't be using btrfs for another decade or so?
2010-06-30T03:01:00.000Z	Dulak	Jordan_U	nope
2010-06-30T03:02:00.000Z	Dulak	Jordan_U	I got burned hard by ext3, never again.
2010-06-30T03:11:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Dulak	Why didn't you have backups?
2010-06-30T03:12:00.000Z	Dulak	Jordan_U	the backups got corrupted too.  Biggest mess of my career
2010-06-30T03:13:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Dulak	That's why you should keep backups out of band and check them regularly. With a proper backup scheme that situation shouldn't be possible.
2010-06-30T03:14:00.000Z	Dulak	Jordan_U	I agree it was a budget issue and I screwed it up.  It has made me less of an early adopter though.
2010-09-17T04:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Dulak	wieshka: There should be no need to boot into recovery mode.
2010-09-17T04:40:00.000Z	Dulak	Jordan_U	you don't fsck a read-write mounted partition, recovery mode mounts read-only
2010-09-17T04:41:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Dulak	It's a separate /boot/partition, it can be unmounted without being in recovery mode.
2010-09-17T05:09:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Dulak	Why do you say that?
2010-09-17T05:11:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Dulak	How does mirroring it increase the chance of it being "hosed"?
2010-09-17T05:12:00.000Z	Dulak	Jordan_U	just keep giving bad advice, yer doing great
2010-11-20T06:49:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Dulak	You can choose to install only a base system.
2011-06-02T00:00:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Dulak	aacharya: Network manager can do system wide configuration just as well as anything else.
2011-06-02T00:00:00.000Z	Dulak	Jordan_U	if X isn't running, network-manager isn't either, so no network
2011-06-02T00:01:00.000Z	Dulak	Jordan_U	which is why the very first thing I do on a ubuntu install is replace network-manager with wicd
2011-06-02T00:01:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Dulak	^^
