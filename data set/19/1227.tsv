2012-02-23T05:50:00.000Z	Stelpa		i really wanted to install vlc2.0, and, i uhh... i dun goofed :(
2012-02-23T05:50:00.000Z	Stelpa		i TOTALLY destroyed my vlc package
2012-02-23T05:50:00.000Z	Stelpa		i can't use the package manager anymore
2012-02-23T05:50:00.000Z	Stelpa		ok
2012-02-23T05:50:00.000Z	Stelpa		here is the error: E: vlc: Package is in a very bad inconsistent state - you should  reinstall it before attempting a removal.
2012-02-23T05:50:00.000Z	setuid	Stelpa	dpkg -P vlc
2012-02-23T05:51:00.000Z	Stelpa	setuid	dpkg: error processing vlc (--purge):
2012-02-23T05:52:00.000Z	setuid	Stelpa	"uploaded"?
2012-02-23T05:52:00.000Z	setuid	Stelpa	If your system correctly accepted it, and installed its dependencies, you should be fine
2012-02-23T05:52:00.000Z	Stelpa	setuid	i really wanted vlc 2.0, even though my system is too old for it, but someone made a .deb file for me, and it didn't work
2012-02-23T05:53:00.000Z	setuid	Stelpa	rm /var/lib/dpkg/info/vlc*
2012-02-23T05:54:00.000Z	Stelpa	setuid	that isn't working either... i really screwed things up :(
2012-02-23T05:55:00.000Z	setuid	Stelpa	What does 'dpkg -l | grep vlc' show?
2012-02-23T05:56:00.000Z	Stelpa	setuid	rc, i think?
2012-02-23T05:56:00.000Z	setuid	Stelpa	what does 'aptitude remove vlc' produce?
2012-02-23T05:57:00.000Z	Stelpa	setuid	this seems to be doing something! :0
2012-02-23T05:59:00.000Z	Stelpa	setuid	Errors were encountered while processing:
2012-02-23T06:02:00.000Z	Stelpa	setuid	i am now considering doing a full system upgrade; this is a 2~ year old system anyways
