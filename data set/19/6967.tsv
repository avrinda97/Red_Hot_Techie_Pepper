2007-11-01T20:43:00.000Z	Guerra		Okay, so I'm getting the "black screen" when I'm trying to install. I've checked the forums but it seems none of the solutions help. Any ideas anyone? Trying to install Gutsy
2007-11-01T20:44:00.000Z	aie93	Guerra	Are you using nVidia?
2007-11-01T20:44:00.000Z	aie93	Guerra	also check your usplash.conf file
2007-11-01T20:44:00.000Z	aie93	Guerra	you can also add vga=791 to the boot line to get into some kind of display
2007-11-01T20:45:00.000Z	aie93	Guerra	if you boot a recovery console from Grub or your install disk you can then mount your root drive and edit the usplash.conf from the command line.  It's a known bug with Gutsy that this causes a blank screen.
2007-11-01T20:46:00.000Z	aie93	Guerra	a god tip to check if that is the issue is boot the computer and leave it 10 minutes, if ti boots then it's usplash.conf (it crashes after a while and carries on anyways)
2007-11-01T20:46:00.000Z	Guerra	aie93	I left it on overnight and it was still stuck
2007-11-01T20:46:00.000Z	aie93	Guerra	where does the screen go black?
2007-11-01T20:53:00.000Z	aie93	Guerra	no idea about DX10 on linux other than Cedega
2007-11-01T20:47:00.000Z	aie93	Guerra	it starts to boot though?
2007-11-01T20:47:00.000Z	aie93	Guerra	have you tried to boot into the (recovery mode) in the grub boot menu?
2007-11-01T20:48:00.000Z	aie93	Guerra	are you trying to load the Live Image off a CD or have you actually installed the system?
2007-11-01T20:49:00.000Z	aie93	Guerra	Ah, right... Have you got the correct disc for your CPU?
2007-11-01T20:49:00.000Z	aie93	Guerra	I have no idea if the 64-bit version of Ubuntu runs on 64-bit Intel...
2007-11-01T20:50:00.000Z	aie93	Guerra	try the 32-bit version (it will work on 64 or 32 bit processors) or you can try the Alternative Install disc, that may help
2007-11-01T20:50:00.000Z	aie93	Guerra	hopefully that'll do the job... If not come back :D
2007-11-01T20:52:00.000Z	aie93	Guerra	it depends on the applications you use, not all of them actually use all 64-bits and the AMD processors use their 64-bit functionality in 32-bit mode for integer maths, not sure about Intel, but it shouldn't make a huge difference
2007-11-01T20:53:00.000Z	Guerra	aie93	what do you know about DX10 for linux?
