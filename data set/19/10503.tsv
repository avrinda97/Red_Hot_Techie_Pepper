2006-06-07T06:40:00.000Z	D4rksh4de		i have 512
2006-06-07T06:40:00.000Z	D4rksh4de		mb
2006-06-07T06:40:00.000Z	D4rksh4de		well, i cant create it
2006-06-07T06:40:00.000Z	D4rksh4de		installer wont let it
2006-06-07T06:41:00.000Z	D4rksh4de		i can create ext3 but no swap
2006-06-07T06:41:00.000Z	D4rksh4de		ill try ext3 then...
2006-06-07T06:42:00.000Z	D4rksh4de		i wonder if there is any limitation of partitions?
2006-06-07T06:43:00.000Z	D4rksh4de		i have currently 3 partitions and maybe it is maximum?
2006-06-07T06:43:00.000Z	D4rksh4de		umm
2006-06-07T06:45:00.000Z	Frogzoo	D4rksh4de	you can have max 4 PRIMARY partitions, but you can make the last primary an extended partition, which can hold another 4, so max is 7
2006-06-07T06:46:00.000Z	D4rksh4de		o.O  it wont let me create any new partitions. i have 3 already
2006-06-07T06:47:00.000Z	D4rksh4de	Frogzoo	i have 1st partition made as extended too
2006-06-07T06:48:00.000Z	D4rksh4de	Frogzoo	and there are 2 partitions
2006-06-07T06:48:00.000Z	D4rksh4de	Frogzoo	and it wont let me create 3rd one
2006-06-07T06:50:00.000Z	Frogzoo	D4rksh4de	that's because you've used up your extended partitions - you need to have the 4th primary as extended (otherwise you lose 3 partitions)
2006-06-07T06:51:00.000Z	Frogzoo	D4rksh4de	but you should be able to create at least 4 extended partitions, so maybe you've allocated all your space
2006-06-07T06:55:00.000Z	D4rksh4de	Frogzoo	ok, let me explain: i have 120gb hdd, 1st partition is 80gb then next is extended and it contains 30gb and now i try to make 2 more on the extended, i was able to create 9gb partition but i cant create more (after creating it wont show it on the list, the list where you choose to format (after that is install))
2006-06-07T06:55:00.000Z	D4rksh4de	Frogzoo	what should i do?
