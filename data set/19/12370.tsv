2008-09-02T08:42:00.000Z	Flannel	ray__	Try #ubuntu-us-fl, or #ubuntu-offtopic, this is a support-only channel

2008-09-05T02:28:00.000Z	Flannel	ray__	Do you still have ths source, etc?
2008-09-05T02:31:00.000Z	Flannel	ray__	that... guide is wrong.  And unfortunately it's wrong in the worst way possible for removing.  You should be compiling things to /usr/local/ not /usr/  But, *try* downloading the source again, and *hope* the makefile has a make uninstall or make remove.
2008-09-05T02:33:00.000Z	Flannel	ray__	Run that thing again up through step 3 (so make, but *not* make install) and then look at the files in your make, and then remove each of those files from your filesystem (not the ones in your make, although you can remove those too)
2008-09-05T02:34:00.000Z	Flannel	ray__	Lots of manual file deletions.  This is why we use package management, because it means we don't have to waste time doing this.
2008-09-05T02:35:00.000Z	Flannel	ray__	You'll see files in your made thing, those will correspond to paths in your actual filesystem.  all "make install" does is copies them.  You'll see once you're looking at it.
2008-09-05T02:36:00.000Z	Flannel	ray__	Nothing automated, no.
2008-09-05T02:36:00.000Z	Flannel	ray__	It doesn't make its own folder, it throws stuff all over.  some stuff in /usr/bin some stuff in /usr/lib some in /usr/share, etc.
2008-09-05T02:39:00.000Z	Flannel	ray__	Open what?
2008-09-05T02:40:00.000Z	Flannel	ray__	You need higher permissions to do it.  If you insist on using the GUI, alt-f2 then gksu nautilus, and be *extremely* careful and close the window as soon as you're done.
2008-09-05T02:43:00.000Z	Flannel	ray__	What?
2008-09-05T02:44:00.000Z	Flannel	ray__	alt-f2 then gksu nautilus, and be *very* *extremely* careful, and close that window as soon as you're done
2008-09-05T02:45:00.000Z	Flannel	ray__	Check the folder created when you make it, and those will correspond to places in your filesystem.
2008-09-05T02:47:00.000Z	Flannel	ray__	You deleted everything in /usr/bin and everything in /usr/lib?
2008-09-05T02:48:00.000Z	Flannel	ray__	Do you see anything in /usr/bin/ ?
2008-09-05T02:50:00.000Z	Flannel	ray__	xmms2 is in the repositories.  Use synaptic to install.
