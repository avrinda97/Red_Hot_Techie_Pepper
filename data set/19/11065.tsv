2007-02-17T16:54:00.000Z	nickreynolds		its wierd how the only user i have setup isn't actually root but its password is
2007-02-17T16:55:00.000Z	nickreynolds		yes but i only have a little backround in that as well, well linux as well
2007-02-17T16:56:00.000Z	nickreynolds		i'm a windows user trying to gain some knowledge in linux, i haven't actually had to use command prompt since dos abck when i was 6 years old
2007-02-17T16:57:00.000Z	nickreynolds		since ubuntu uses the debian core then that means apache, python, php, and sql are all preinstalled correct
2007-02-17T16:57:00.000Z	Trunkz	nickreynolds	Providing you dont have some odd hardware.. ubuntu will be a nice thing =p
2007-02-17T16:58:00.000Z	Trunkz	nickreynolds	uh.. you can easily install those using apt-get =P
2007-02-17T16:58:00.000Z	Trunkz	nickreynolds	such as typing.. sudo apt-get install mysql-server will sort u out ur sql server ;)
2007-02-17T16:58:00.000Z	Trunkz	nickreynolds	I was having a look around a while back, on some sort of a LAMP setup on ubuntu.. maybe someone can clariffy this for you as well ;p
2007-02-18T17:42:00.000Z	Trunkz	nickreynolds	try apt-get install tightvnc (or tightvnc-server.. cant remember)
2007-02-18T17:43:00.000Z	Trunkz	nickreynolds	hold on.. lemme do a quick search =p

2007-02-18T17:55:00.000Z	Trunkz	nickreynolds	make sure a vnc server is running on that ubuntu box, and use tightvnc on ur windows box to connect to it :)
2007-02-18T17:55:00.000Z	Trunkz	nickreynolds	using ssh wont give u a gnome session, it'll give u a terminal/console session
