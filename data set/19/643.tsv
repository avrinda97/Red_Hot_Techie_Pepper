2011-11-02T21:49:00.000Z	mathgirl	harsh343	Do you mean that's the name of your terminal window?
2011-11-02T21:51:00.000Z	mathgirl	harsh343	The title of your terminal window is usually something you can set as a preference.  If you tell me which terminal application you're using, I can run it and see where the preference is.
2011-11-02T21:52:00.000Z	mathgirl	harsh343	If you don't know which, I'll give you a command to find out.

2011-11-02T21:57:00.000Z	mathgirl	harsh343	In your terminal, you can go to Edit-> Profile Preferences Then choose the Title and Command tab.
2011-11-02T21:58:00.000Z	harsh343	mathgirl	command not found
2011-11-02T21:59:00.000Z	mathgirl	harsh343	Can you click the Edit menu at the top of your terminal?
2011-11-02T22:02:00.000Z	mathgirl	harsh343	Can you select "Profile Preferences" from that menu?
2011-11-02T22:03:00.000Z	mathgirl	harsh343	Next to the "General" Tab is the "Title and Command" tab.
2011-11-02T22:04:00.000Z	mathgirl	harsh343	Select that.
2011-11-02T22:07:00.000Z	mathgirl	harsh343	A lot of terminals change the title of the window to reflect output inside the terminal.  I'm suggesting you try to turn that off.
2011-11-02T22:09:00.000Z	mathgirl	harsh343	Underneath the Initial Title box, there shoudl be a dropdown that says "Replace initial title" Correct?
2011-11-02T22:23:00.000Z	harsh343	mathgirl	thanks
