2008-12-24T07:25:00.000Z	justmeyogs		are older versions of ubuntu still available?
2008-12-24T07:25:00.000Z	justmeyogs		i have an old ibm thinkpad, would kubuntu be my better bet to install?
2008-12-24T07:25:00.000Z	Cpudan80	justmeyogs	no
2008-12-24T07:26:00.000Z	justmeyogs		A21m
2008-12-24T07:26:00.000Z	Cpudan80	justmeyogs	Why do think kubuntu would be better?
2008-12-24T07:26:00.000Z	Cpudan80		A21 ?
2008-12-24T07:26:00.000Z	Cpudan80		ouch
2008-12-24T07:26:00.000Z	Cpudan80		that is old
2008-12-24T07:26:00.000Z	justmeyogs		Cpudan: I was under the impression kubuntu was for systems with lower resources
2008-12-24T07:26:00.000Z	Cpudan80	justmeyogs	That's Xubuntu
2008-12-24T07:27:00.000Z	Cpudan80	justmeyogs	KDE uses more resources than gnome
2008-12-24T07:27:00.000Z	justmeyogs	Torgoton	A21m
2008-12-24T07:27:00.000Z	justmeyogs		what GUI does xubuntu use?
2008-12-24T07:27:00.000Z	Cpudan80	justmeyogs	XFCE
2008-12-24T07:27:00.000Z	Cpudan80	justmeyogs	Looks very similar to gnome
2008-12-24T07:28:00.000Z	Cpudan80		And Torgoton has a good point -- how much mem do you have justmeyogs
2008-12-24T07:28:00.000Z	justmeyogs		256 ram
2008-12-24T07:28:00.000Z	justmeyogs		max ram is 512
2008-12-24T07:28:00.000Z	Cpudan80	justmeyogs	Go with XUbuntu unless you max it out to 512, in which case go with regular
