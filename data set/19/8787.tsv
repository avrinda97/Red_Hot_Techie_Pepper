2007-02-07T10:12:00.000Z	gpled	guest_uris	i have installed a sata drive
2007-02-07T10:13:00.000Z	guest_uris	gpled	it doesn't detect the hard drive
2007-02-07T10:14:00.000Z	gpled	guest_uris	this the first time you putting a sata in that motherboard?
2007-02-07T10:14:00.000Z	guest_uris	gpled	XP installed fine, but ubuntu can't see the hard drive.
2007-02-07T10:14:00.000Z	gpled	guest_uris	need to make sure your bios is set right for it to work
2007-02-07T10:15:00.000Z	gpled	guest_uris	you using 6.10?
2007-02-07T10:15:00.000Z	guest_uris	gpled	yse
2007-02-07T10:15:00.000Z	guest_uris	gpled	yes*
2007-02-07T10:15:00.000Z	gpled	guest_uris	try 6.06. bet it works
2007-02-07T10:15:00.000Z	guest_uris	gpled	ok, was thinking about using OpenSuSE if it doesnt work, or buy an IDE.
2007-02-07T10:16:00.000Z	gpled	guest_uris	if this is for a server, give centos a try
2007-02-07T10:17:00.000Z	guest_uris	gpled	ok, it is for a server, to host an EMR for a small hospital
2007-02-07T10:17:00.000Z	gpled	guest_uris	think you will be happy with centos for production
2007-02-07T10:18:00.000Z	gpled	guest_uris	also, great support in centos channel
2007-02-07T10:18:00.000Z	guest_uris	gpled	thhanks, will give it a try. but I am running short on time, so have to do it with Ubuntu for now.
2007-02-07T10:19:00.000Z	gpled	guest_uris	sata is great, but can be tricky at your fist try.   if you can go ide, that will get you going fast.  but i would stay away from 6.10 for production
2007-02-07T10:23:00.000Z	guest_uris	gpled	is CentOS Debian-based?
2007-02-07T10:24:00.000Z	gpled	guest_uris	it is redhat enterprise
2007-02-07T10:37:00.000Z	guest_uris	gpled	6.06 isn't installing either, can't find the hard drive. I guess will wait for the IDE drive to reach.
