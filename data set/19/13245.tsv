2008-01-14T11:40:00.000Z	dka7414		i did as you said and i went to /home/username/.wine and its still not got all the original files it had when i first installed
2008-01-14T11:41:00.000Z	dka7414		adamg= what does that purge command do anyway? a complete removal
2008-01-14T11:43:00.000Z	dka7414		I've had this problem before when uninstalling and then reinstalling its like synaptic sees old files and responds differently then it would a clean install
2008-01-14T11:43:00.000Z	dka7414		but i appreciate the help thanx
2008-01-14T11:43:00.000Z	dka7414		any other ideas?
2008-01-14T11:44:00.000Z	dka7414		what kind of search does a all around search of the file system
2008-01-14T11:44:00.000Z	dka7414		or do i have to do it the hard way
2008-01-14T11:44:00.000Z	nickrud	dka7414	locate after a sudo updatedb
2008-01-14T11:46:00.000Z	nickrud	dka7414	it comes standard
2008-01-14T11:50:00.000Z	nickrud	dka7414	it quit without errors
2008-01-14T11:50:00.000Z	nickrud	dka7414	that's what exit 0 means
2008-01-20T23:57:00.000Z	nickrud	dka7414	unmount the partition suse is on, write a new file system to it, then run sudo update-grub
2008-01-20T23:59:00.000Z	nickrud	dka7414	basically reformat it as an ext3 , that will erase all of suse and prep it for use
2008-01-20T23:59:00.000Z	nickrud	dka7414	when you reformat it, the UUID will change, and you will also have to update /etc/fstab to the new value
2008-01-21T00:01:00.000Z	nickrud	dka7414	adding it equally to the two other os's will depend on your layout, you probably can't just do it.
2008-01-21T00:02:00.000Z	nickrud	dka7414	I'm really conservative about my computers, I don't generally resize and move them. I like my data
2008-01-21T00:03:00.000Z	nickrud	dka7414	yes, I did that once (but I had a backup) so I don't do it anymore. I backup, move/change partitions, then put the data back
2008-01-21T00:04:00.000Z	nickrud	dka7414	yes, exactly. Or you could simply mount it as /data (or some other place) and use it for shared data between os's. It's free for any use
2008-01-21T00:07:00.000Z	nickrud	dka7414	I keep /home on a separate partition for several reasons: I can reinstall without losing the data in my home, I use it in different os's, I can use disk level backups. Many good reasons to have it
