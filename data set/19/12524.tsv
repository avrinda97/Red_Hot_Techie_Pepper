2005-08-24T15:45:00.000Z	crimsun	nudnick	you can disable the loading of pcmcia drivers from the boot line
2005-08-24T15:46:00.000Z	crimsun	nudnick	see the help by pressing F3 when the boot line appears when you boot from the installer cd
2005-08-24T15:47:00.000Z	nudnick	crimsun	would you mind walking me through it i'm really new to linux
2005-08-24T15:48:00.000Z	crimsun	nudnick	when you boot from the installer cd, there's an orange Ubuntu screen that shows up
2005-08-24T15:48:00.000Z	crimsun	nudnick	press F3
2005-08-24T15:48:00.000Z	crimsun	nudnick	something along those lines
2005-08-24T15:49:00.000Z	crimsun	nudnick	F1?
2005-08-24T15:49:00.000Z	nudnick	crimsun	I hit F1. then hit F3. then i type in pcmcia=off and hit enter but it dosen't accept it
2005-08-24T15:50:00.000Z	crimsun	nudnick	you need to type the image name first.
2005-08-24T15:50:00.000Z	crimsun	nudnick	linux pcmcia=off
2005-08-24T15:51:00.000Z	nudnick	crimsun	i typed in linux pcmcia:off but it still stalls there
2005-08-24T15:52:00.000Z	crimsun	nudnick	I may, but ping me first
