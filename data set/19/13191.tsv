2005-05-18T06:00:00.000Z	ax		yeah, almost everytime my girlfriend goes to "myspace" it freezes
2005-05-18T06:01:00.000Z	ax		yeah, it freezes for her very often
2005-05-18T06:02:00.000Z	ax		is there a gui tool for killing stuff when it is frozen?
2005-05-18T06:02:00.000Z	synd	ax	yes
2005-05-18T06:02:00.000Z	synd		in gnome
2005-05-18T06:02:00.000Z	ax		i can just teach her to use kill on a terminal but easier for her makes things easier for me
2005-05-18T06:02:00.000Z	ax		yeah, she's using gnome.. what is it called?
2005-05-18T06:03:00.000Z	synd	ax	theres a thing that you can put on the panel and it kills whatever program you click after you click it
2005-05-18T06:03:00.000Z	synd	ax	you do "Add to Panel..." and add the "Force Quit" option to the panel
2005-05-18T06:03:00.000Z	ax	synd	huh, that sounds dangerous, is there an app that she can just see the names of programs running that she can kill and kill what she wants to?
2005-05-18T06:04:00.000Z	synd	ax	its not, really
2005-05-18T06:04:00.000Z	synd	ax	it asks for a confirmation
2005-05-18T06:04:00.000Z	ax	synd	ok.. that's cool :) thanks
2005-05-18T06:04:00.000Z	synd	ax	you try it out?
2005-05-18T06:05:00.000Z	synd	ax	no prob
2005-05-18T06:05:00.000Z	ax		i think the fact that she is a girl is very positive because she is a girl and is using linux
2005-05-18T06:06:00.000Z	synd	ax	those are few and far between
