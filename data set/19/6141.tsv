2009-04-10T14:12:00.000Z	guja		If I get this message "W: GPG error: http://packages.medibuntu.org jaunty Release: The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY 2EBC26B60C5A2783" when trying to do apt-get update, what am I supposed to do to make that repository also update?
2009-04-10T14:14:00.000Z	guja		Hm. When I add medibuntu repo and try to install skype under Jaunty amd64, it pulls me 32bit Skype when doing apt-get install skype. Why?
2009-04-10T14:14:00.000Z	imachine	guja	there's no 64bit skype,afaik
2009-04-10T14:15:00.000Z	imachine	guja	it uses binary compatibility with 32bit apps on 64bit installs.
2009-04-10T14:15:00.000Z	imachine	guja	thank skype.com
2009-04-10T14:15:00.000Z	imachine		:-)
2009-04-10T14:15:00.000Z	guja		Idiots.
2009-04-10T14:15:00.000Z	guja	imachine	is it harmless to install all those 32bit libraries and run 32bit programs under amd64?
2009-04-10T14:15:00.000Z	imachine	guja	perfectly harmless.
2009-04-10T14:16:00.000Z	imachine	guja	ubuntu automates the process anyway
2009-04-10T14:16:00.000Z	guja	imachine	thank you very much for answers.
2009-04-10T14:16:00.000Z	imachine	guja	also, you can use a skype-static version.
2009-04-10T14:16:00.000Z	imachine	guja	that has all the required libs built in so you don't need to pull many deps.
2009-04-10T14:16:00.000Z	guja	imachine	skype-static is? 32bit also?
2009-04-10T14:16:00.000Z	imachine		yea methinks.
2009-04-10T14:16:00.000Z	guja		Aham, it has dependencies inside.
2009-04-10T14:16:00.000Z	guja		Got it.
2009-04-10T14:17:00.000Z	imachine	guja	cheers
2009-04-10T14:17:00.000Z	guja	imachine	*thumbsup*
