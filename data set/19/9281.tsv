2008-01-24T20:11:00.000Z	genii	punkshui	You are trying to remount /home elsewhere or just to umount it ?
2008-01-24T20:11:00.000Z	punkshui	SleepingSloth	I dont know this is all becoming too complicated. you see im trying to recreate the DellUtility partition (I thought I only needed the DellRestore partition)
2008-01-24T20:11:00.000Z	punkshui		genii I am trying to restore my system to its factory settings but I need to recreate a Utility partition that was on here before..
2008-01-24T20:12:00.000Z	punkshui		genii i have too many partitions to recreate it. however the space which the partition used before is still there.. untouched its just no longer a partition anymore
2008-01-24T20:13:00.000Z	genii	punkshui	Because if you are just trying to remount it elsewhere, you can do that with something like edit fstab to the new mountpoint, then: (sudo) mount -o remount /devname        (not /mountname since it is different after editing the fstab)
2008-01-24T20:14:00.000Z	punkshui		genii actually i was trying to make it so i only have a / partition. i dont want my /home partition anymore
2008-01-24T20:14:00.000Z	punkshui		genii i want it reallocated into /
2008-01-24T20:14:00.000Z	punkshui	SleepingSloth	gparted
2008-01-24T20:15:00.000Z	genii	punkshui	Ah. For that you'l have to tinker from livecd then, or Recovery mode since root's home is not in /home but in /root
2008-01-24T20:17:00.000Z	punkshui		genii i see. any ideas for this unallocated space.. presumably it still has all the files I need there. its just not a partition anymore... if i create it as say a fat16 partition would the files formerly there return?
2008-01-24T20:17:00.000Z	punkshui	SleepingSloth	correct
2008-01-24T20:19:00.000Z	genii	punkshui	Recovering the files on it will be possible if you have not deleted the partition or resized it. eg: the only change was to change the partition type or just umount it
2008-01-24T20:19:00.000Z	genii	punkshui	If you deleted the original then resized it not much hope
2008-01-24T20:19:00.000Z	punkshui		genii the partition no longer exists. it is unallocated space
2008-01-24T20:20:00.000Z	genii	punkshui	Then there is not much hope of files recovery
2008-01-24T20:20:00.000Z	punkshui		genii alright. thanks
2008-01-24T20:21:00.000Z	genii	punkshui	Wait. Unallocated... but did you resize it?
2008-01-24T20:21:00.000Z	genii	punkshui	Or just free it up
2008-01-24T20:25:00.000Z	genii	punkshui	Something to try as a last resort:  at Terminal run: sudo fdisk /dev/<the drive name here>       eg: sda3   or whatever used to be the /home    then t to change partition tye. Put in 83 for type. then w  to write changes. then see if you can manually mount it
