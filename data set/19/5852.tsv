2008-05-27T04:53:00.000Z	Chrysalis		whats up with f-spot importing thousands of photos and making duplicates?  i just want something to browse photos with etc. . .
2008-05-27T04:54:00.000Z	Scunizi	Chrysalis	is only makes duplicates to put in it's designated directory when you leave that option on
2008-05-27T04:54:00.000Z	Chrysalis	Scunizi	whats the point? i mean why does it do it
2008-05-27T04:56:00.000Z	Scunizi	Chrysalis	alot of times you're importing from a camera or cd.. you don't want to edit a file on the camera's flash and can't on a cd.. best I can come up with.
2008-05-27T04:57:00.000Z	Scunizi	Chrysalis	it also creates it's own database of the photos .. i guess it's easier to do if they're all in one primary directory. It also takes the imported photos and puts them into directories under the primary by year, month & date..
2008-05-27T04:58:00.000Z	Chrysalis	Scunizi	good you mention the year/month thing too, thats even more retarded
2008-05-27T04:59:00.000Z	Chrysalis	Scunizi	ffs, if you have photos they are already organized on your hd, who puts all photos in a single directory needing a program to sort them for you
2008-05-27T05:00:00.000Z	Scunizi	Chrysalis	depends on your point of view.. easier to find things by date if you remember.. you can also tag photos on import or after. that makes it easier to view a select group of pics.  For other viewing programs try Mapivi & gthumb
2008-05-27T05:02:00.000Z	Scunizi	Chrysalis	gthumb will allow you to browse folders you already have setup
2008-05-27T05:07:00.000Z	Chrysalis	Scunizi	it feels like a juke box now that i think about it (fspot that is) so does pretty much every program on gnome really, i am not sure why its so hard to just make straigt forward light programs that just work
2008-05-27T05:08:00.000Z	Scunizi	Chrysalis	fspot is a lot like Picasa in some ways.. it'll even upload to picasa and other sites like flicker..
2008-05-27T05:16:00.000Z	Chrysalis	Scunizi	being like picasa is nothing to be proud of really ;p, why i left windows is cause i was using open software trying to stay away from all the corporate bloatware to only find its even worse in gnome, its seems kde is really what seems to have the thought out software
2008-05-27T05:17:00.000Z	Scunizi	Chrysalis	sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop then just switch sessions on the login screen or.. install kde progs. inside of gnome.. they work
2008-05-27T05:18:00.000Z	Scunizi	Chrysalis	each to their own needs.. I prefer gnome but there are some kde programs that do what I need.
2008-05-27T05:21:00.000Z	Chrysalis	Scunizi	i used kde for a month, apps are awesome but you just cant find your way around in there, theres like 10 different places to change the same setting and also lots of crashes
2008-05-27T05:21:00.000Z	Scunizi	Chrysalis	that's why I use my kde programs from inside of gnome.
2008-05-27T05:23:00.000Z	Chrysalis	Scunizi	so then its kinda obvious gnome apps suck balls i take it ;p
2008-05-27T05:23:00.000Z	Chrysalis	Scunizi	if your using kde apps in gnome
2008-05-27T05:24:00.000Z	Scunizi	Chrysalis	no.. that's not what I said. I find most of them work just fine for me. It's just a couple of things I use because I like the program or it has a specific feature I use.
