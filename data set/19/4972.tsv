2009-05-25T05:06:00.000Z	jimisrvrox_		hey guys having issues with this broadcom 4318 wireless nic and have tried some guides and am stuck on extracting the .sys file I would appreciate some assistance when possible..
2009-05-25T05:06:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jimisrvrox_	Have you tried System > Administration ? Hardware Drivers?
2009-05-25T05:15:00.000Z	jimisrvrox_	Jordan_U	sorry dude I was getting something to eat but yes Ive tried that as well.
2009-05-25T05:16:00.000Z	jimisrvrox_	Jordan_U	I have the bcmwl5.inf driver installed but I have to also extract the .sys file for the stuff to work
2009-05-25T05:18:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jimisrvrox_	What happened when you tried Hardware Drivers? You should already have the firmware you need and thus shouldn't need to extract anything ( to check if you have the firmware, see if there are directories named /lib/firmware/b43 and /lib/firmware/b43-legacy )
2009-05-25T05:19:00.000Z	jimisrvrox_	Jordan_U	I went the ndiswrapper route
2009-05-25T05:19:00.000Z	jimisrvrox_	Jordan_U	when I do hardware drivers and click activate it gets to about 50% search and fetch whatever and stops
2009-05-25T05:20:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jimisrvrox_	I don't reccommend ndiswrapper as the open source drivers for your chipset are fine once you have the firmware ( though installing ndiswqrapper and blacklisting b43 can both prevent the open drivers from working )
2009-05-25T05:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jimisrvrox_	If Hardware Drivers didn't complete then it's not in use yet
2009-05-25T05:21:00.000Z	jimisrvrox_	Jordan_U	got it
2009-05-25T05:22:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jimisrvrox_	You can download the file manually if Hardware Drivers is failing, or try simply running "sudo /usr/share/b43-fwcutter/install_bcm43xx_firmware.sh
2009-05-25T05:22:00.000Z	jimisrvrox_	Jordan_U	thanks I appreciate it but I would like to know how the hell I managed to get the thing to work bc obviously it was not supported in the kernel..I am absent minded of what firmware I had to grab in order for it to work properly..
2009-05-25T05:23:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jimisrvrox_	So it's working now?
2009-05-25T05:23:00.000Z	jimisrvrox_	Jordan_U	yeah I had tried something like that but it was telling me bcm43xx-fwcutter command not found and I had b43-fwcutter installed..so idk..ive always had probs with installing these stupid wifi cards and Id like to really get it to where I can do that crap in about 10 minutes of work
2009-05-25T05:24:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jimisrvrox_	Be carefull not to use out of date tutorials, the command is now b43-fwcutter not bcm43xx-fwcutter
2009-05-25T05:25:00.000Z	jimisrvrox_	Jordan_U	right right..
2009-05-25T05:25:00.000Z	jimisrvrox_	Jordan_U	do you mind if I pm you?
2009-05-25T05:25:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jimisrvrox_	Before you use any tutorial first check the official documentation and wiki.ubuntu.com *then* if there is no tutorial there make sure that the tutorial you are following explicitly states that it's for your version of Ubuntu
2009-05-25T05:25:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jimisrvrox_	No
