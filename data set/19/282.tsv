2012-11-02T01:17:00.000Z	mpavel		anyone have any idea what to do if only guest account is enabled on new install?
2012-11-02T01:18:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	mpavel	are you sure what is the evidence of this?
2012-11-02T01:19:00.000Z	mpavel	wilee-nilee	switched to ctrl+alt+f1 to terminal tried logging in as defined user in setup, no luck, tried root, no luck
2012-11-02T01:20:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	mpavel	Is this a direct install or a remote?
2012-11-02T01:21:00.000Z	mpavel	wilee-nilee	direct install, but with problems
2012-11-02T01:21:00.000Z	mpavel	wilee-nilee	tried to install (lubuntu 12.10) several times, from USB & CD and no luck. then I booted from live CD and ran Boot Repair, which allowed me to FINALLY boot the system up (which I'm using now) but only from the guest account :(
2012-11-02T01:22:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	mpavel	If it were me I would just install again trying to fix it will take longer probably, but I just go with time spent generally against fixing
2012-11-02T01:22:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	mpavel	This a fairly new computer possibly using a UEFI bios as far as the boot problem.
2012-11-02T01:23:00.000Z	mpavel	wilee-nilee	yeah, but I already went through the install process 5 times :(( I might try something else like Linux Mint - it's my dad's old computer that I wanted to install something light
2012-11-02T01:24:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	mpavel	Mint is ubuntu in drag basically, with way less support just a heads up.
2012-11-02T01:24:00.000Z	mpavel	wilee-nilee	ok, thanks, I'm off, getting late and no more patience to solve this, thanks for your help and a good day/night ahead! :)
2012-11-02T01:25:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	mpavel	YOu might run the bootscript so we can see whats there, the bootrepiar generates a bootinfo url
2012-11-02T01:25:00.000Z	mpavel	wilee-nilee	I have the Boot Repair pastebin: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1324811/
2012-11-02T01:26:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	mpavel	Thanks hold on
2012-11-02T01:30:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	mpavel	I would post that script on the ubuntu forums with boot repair in the header, the maker of that app is there daily and a handful of regulars that know this stuff as well, I see a few anomalies but this needs one who knows more. ;)
2012-11-02T01:31:00.000Z	mpavel	wilee-nilee	ok, thank you again for your help!
2012-11-02T01:31:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	mpavel	If you do the forum make sure the script posted represents the set exactly.
2012-11-02T01:32:00.000Z	mpavel	wilee-nilee	ok, I'll make sure - if I retry setup I will be a different one for sure
2012-11-02T01:32:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	mpavel	cool, hope you get it working.
