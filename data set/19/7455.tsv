2007-08-19T05:31:00.000Z	kmak	Oliazk	you may need to set your wifi card to the correct mode
2007-08-19T05:32:00.000Z	kmak	Oliazk	in terminal 'sudo iwpriv <interface name> authmode 1
2007-08-19T05:33:00.000Z	Oliazk	kmak	yeah i get invalid command authmode when i do that
2007-08-19T05:34:00.000Z	kmak	Oliazk	what is the command you entered?
2007-08-19T05:35:00.000Z	Oliazk	kmak	sudo iwpriv ra0 authmode 1        like you said to do
2007-08-19T05:36:00.000Z	kmak	Oliazk	hmm...and you already have the wep key entered, 'sudo iwconfig ra0 key <wep key>' ??
2007-08-19T05:37:00.000Z	Oliazk	kmak	yes i have entered the key i have also disable the security and tried connecting like that and it works it jsut does not want to work when i secure the connection for some reason
2007-08-19T05:38:00.000Z	kmak	Oliazk	that's very strange. not sure why iwpriv will not let you set authmode. it must be set to 1 for wep to work, iirc
2007-08-19T05:39:00.000Z	Oliazk	kmak	is there anything else i could try to see if iwpriv works with the rt2500 (stupid anoying card arg)
2007-08-19T05:40:00.000Z	kmak	Oliazk	not sure about that. my roommate has a similar card and it works fine. wish i could help!
2007-08-19T05:40:00.000Z	Oliazk	kmak	so far with ubuntu i have had the most lucky and unlucky
2007-08-19T06:00:00.000Z	kmak	Oliazk	you got it?
2007-08-19T06:01:00.000Z	Oliazk	kmak	yeah  i put in wicd and rebooted and it seems to be working now
2007-08-19T06:01:00.000Z	kmak	Oliazk	awesome! I'll remember that
2007-08-19T06:08:00.000Z	kmak	Oliazk	Isn't wireless just a fucking joy :-)
2007-08-19T06:08:00.000Z	Oliazk	kmak	only with this damn card it is
2007-08-19T06:08:00.000Z	kmak	Oliazk	maybe check your routing (route -n) make sure everything is correct
2007-08-19T06:09:00.000Z	Oliazk	kmak	the laptop i am using right now is having no problems what so ever and it can only use wifi but its madwifi
2007-08-19T06:10:00.000Z	kmak	Oliazk	gotta run...best wishes!
