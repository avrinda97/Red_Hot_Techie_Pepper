2006-04-08T15:26:00.000Z	DJ_Tobias		anybody using the latest 2-6.16 kernel?
2006-04-08T15:26:00.000Z	DJ_Tobias		downloading it now healot
2006-04-08T06:38:00.000Z	DJ_Tobias		i am compiling a new kernel and i was wondering.. under cpu info, if i have an amd 64 x2 cpu which option do i pick..386 ?
2006-04-08T06:39:00.000Z	DJ_Tobias		or athlon64 ?
2006-04-08T06:39:00.000Z	dj-fu	DJ_Tobias	are you running 64bit binaries or 32bit? if you have a 32bit system, choose 386 or 686. if not, choose amd64
2006-04-08T06:39:00.000Z	DJ_Tobias	dj-fu	64bit
2006-04-08T06:39:00.000Z	DJ_Tobias		as far as i know..
2006-04-08T06:39:00.000Z	dj-fu	DJ_Tobias	what does uname -r say?
2006-04-08T06:39:00.000Z	dj-fu		`uname -r`
2006-04-08T06:40:00.000Z	DJ_Tobias		AMD Athlon(tm) 64 X2 Dual Core Processor 3800+ is my cpu 2.6.12-9-386 is what uname -r says
2006-04-08T06:40:00.000Z	dj-fu	DJ_Tobias	then you're running a 32bit kernel now
2006-04-08T06:40:00.000Z	dj-fu	DJ_Tobias	you'll want to choose 386
2006-04-08T06:40:00.000Z	DJ_Tobias	dj-fu	how come 386 ?
2006-04-08T06:41:00.000Z	dj-fu	DJ_Tobias	because you're already running 386, if you decide to run a 64bit kernel it *may* lead to problems
2006-04-08T06:41:00.000Z	dj-fu	DJ_Tobias	by all means, try it out. I dare ya. It might work, it might not. I've no experience with 64bit systems, though.
2006-04-08T06:41:00.000Z	DJ_Tobias		oh.. whats the difference in a 32 bit and 64 bit system?
2006-04-08T06:41:00.000Z	dj-fu		Address space for memory access
2006-04-08T06:42:00.000Z	dj-fu		and uh, other things which I forget.
2006-04-08T06:42:00.000Z	DJ_Tobias	dj-fu	^^
