2012-01-05T08:37:00.000Z	stahlie		I'm disappointed with blender on ubuntu...it crashed on me several time... I can't imagine putting hours and hours on it then suddenly it crashed... would have to save it often.    maybe it doesn't like sony vaio graphic driver
2012-01-05T08:37:00.000Z	agoole22	stahlie	I used blender for 1 whole week without rebooting my laptop, worked fine..
2012-01-05T08:37:00.000Z	stahlie	agoole22	 what kind of graphic device do you have?
2012-01-05T08:38:00.000Z	stahlie	agoole22	i have sony vaio and i think it's using intel graphic which it doesn't like
2012-01-05T08:39:00.000Z	agoole22	stahlie	just running an acer, with intel graphics, nothing special
2012-01-05T08:45:00.000Z	stahlie	agoole22	are you using xfce?
2012-01-05T08:45:00.000Z	agoole22	stahlie	no
2012-01-05T08:45:00.000Z	stahlie	agoole22	wonder if blender doesn't like xfce...which one are you using kde? or gnome?
2012-01-05T08:46:00.000Z	agoole22	stahlie	I ran a fresh install, and added blender. Worked fine. You could always try to install from source.
2012-01-05T08:47:00.000Z	agoole22	stahlie	I'd suggest installing from source beforer dumping xfce
2012-01-05T08:47:00.000Z	stahlie	agoole22	 i am using ubuntu studio
2012-01-05T08:47:00.000Z	stahlie	agoole22	from reading online, it said ubuntu studio is best for multimedia
2012-01-05T08:47:00.000Z	agoole22	stahlie	yeah, but that doesn't prevent you from building blender from the source code.
2012-01-05T08:49:00.000Z	stahlie	agoole22	okay i'll try building blender ... so do i need to remove blender first?  (pardon me i'm somewhat newbie)
2012-01-05T08:50:00.000Z	agoole22	stahlie	yeah, save your work, and delete it, and build from source, I would suggest
2012-01-05T08:51:00.000Z	stahlie	agoole22	so what's the best way to delete blender?   I can take it from there
2012-01-05T08:52:00.000Z	agoole22	stahlie	terminal, sudo apt-get remove blender
2012-01-05T08:54:00.000Z	stahlie	agoole22	okay  so after that...do i download tar.gz    or do the apt-get?
2012-01-05T08:54:00.000Z	agoole22	stahlie	follow the .tar.gz instructions
