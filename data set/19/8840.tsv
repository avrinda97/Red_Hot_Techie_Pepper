2007-03-06T11:27:00.000Z	kelsin	zero88	without errors it's REALLY hard to debug dude, do you have any idea what it was saying?
2007-03-06T11:28:00.000Z	zero88	kelsin	ya ill boot up and il write it down, brb
2007-03-06T11:38:00.000Z	zero88	kelsin	the error is ()ww) I810: no matching device section for instance (busid pci:0:2:0) found     (ee) no devices detected fatal server error: no screens found
2007-03-06T11:39:00.000Z	kelsin	zero88	you need to install the i810 driver
2007-03-06T11:40:00.000Z	zero88	kelsin	ok,so whyle in text mode with ubuntu how owuld i do that?
2007-03-06T11:40:00.000Z	kelsin	zero88	one sec
2007-03-06T11:41:00.000Z	zero88	kelsin	k sorry didnt mean to post twice
2007-03-06T11:41:00.000Z	kelsin	zero88	from the console "sudo aptitude install xserver-xorg-video-i810"
2007-03-06T11:41:00.000Z	kelsin	zero88	oh no problem, just telling you one sec while I look up the package
2007-03-06T11:42:00.000Z	zero88	kelsin	ok thanks, so after i do that in text mode i will be able to startx?
2007-03-06T11:42:00.000Z	kelsin	zero88	no garuntees, it sounds like from your error message that the i810 driver was not installed, that command will install it, so let's hope
2007-03-06T11:43:00.000Z	kelsin	zero88	also if you're up for fun you can install irssi and chat from your linux console
2007-03-06T11:43:00.000Z	zero88	kelsin	ok thanks i will give it try ...Ok kool that will be alot easier thanks
2007-03-06T11:44:00.000Z	kelsin	zero88	if that doesn't work you can etc your xorg.conf and switch "i810" to "vesa" just like omeil is recomending
