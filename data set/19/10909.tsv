2007-02-09T06:06:00.000Z	yellow	jrattner	apt-get install tor privoxy
2007-02-09T06:07:00.000Z	jrattner	yellow	no i see the package, but is there any configurational things i need to do
2007-02-09T06:07:00.000Z	yellow	jrattner	then fix privoxy config as in the tor doc, then you're done
2007-02-09T06:07:00.000Z	yellow	jrattner	to use privoxy you need to edit privoxy config
2007-02-09T06:08:00.000Z	jrattner	yellow	do u know where the "tor doc" your refering  to is?
2007-02-09T06:09:00.000Z	jrattner	yellow	?
2007-02-09T06:09:00.000Z	yellow	jrattner	http://tor.eff.org/docs/tor-doc-unix.html.en
2007-02-09T06:09:00.000Z	yellow	jrattner	skip the installation part since you've got it through ubuntu repos already
2007-02-09T06:10:00.000Z	yellow	jrattner	Once you've installed Privoxy (either from package or from source), you will need to configure Privoxy to use Tor. Open Privoxy's "config" file (look in /etc/privoxy/ or /usr/local/etc/) and add the line
2007-02-09T06:15:00.000Z	jrattner	yellow	Is there anyway for me to confirm that Tor is working?
2007-02-09T06:18:00.000Z	yellow	jrattner	try ps aux | grep tor
2007-02-09T06:19:00.000Z	yellow	jrattner	then go to firefox, edit the preferences to use proxy localhost @ 8118 and socks @ 9050
2007-02-09T06:19:00.000Z	yellow	jrattner	then point firefox to ipchicken.com, if it's not your ip then you're good
2007-02-09T06:20:00.000Z	jrattner	yellow	cool its working thanx alot
