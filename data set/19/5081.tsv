2009-04-05T22:48:00.000Z	todd__		Anyone know why lanmap gives me a empty diagram when I do sudo lanmap -i eth0 -r 30 -T png -o /tmp/
2009-04-05T22:49:00.000Z	aar	todd__	probably because your network uses switches? switches prevent pepole from sniffing, which is essentially what lanmap does.
2009-04-05T22:50:00.000Z	todd__	aar	OK how do I get past my switch???
2009-04-05T22:50:00.000Z	aar	todd__	it's impossible i'm afraid. you can't sniff past a switch
2009-04-05T22:50:00.000Z	todd__	aar	has a lynksys router I am trying to diagram
2009-04-05T22:51:00.000Z	todd__	aar	OK... what should I have to allow this to work?
2009-04-05T22:53:00.000Z	todd__	aar	OK... what should I have to allow this to work?
2009-04-05T22:54:00.000Z	aar	todd__	you can't use lanmap unmodified in a network with switches, you'd need to do what ultraj6 is describing (which is fairly complex).
2009-04-05T22:54:00.000Z	todd__	aar	OK, so what are my options outher then a switch?
2009-04-05T22:55:00.000Z	todd__	aar	OK... what should I have other then a switch to allow this to work?
2009-04-05T22:55:00.000Z	aar	todd__	a switch is a physical connection in a network, used to redirect traffic. it prevents users from sniffing past it (unless you do what ultraj6 has described, which is technically speaking not passive sniffing). i'd recommend you read more about sniffing and man in the middle attacks in wikipedia to learn about how the system works
2009-04-05T22:58:00.000Z	todd__	aar	OK so this thing just dosent work, is there another tool I can use to get a network diagram of my network that does??? Or do I have to use windows for this?
2009-04-05T22:59:00.000Z	aar	todd__	as ultraj6 has described, you need to do a man in the middle attack for what you want (be it in linux or in windows). sniffing will not work in your case, because it will only take you to the nearest switch.
2009-04-05T23:00:00.000Z	todd__	aar	NOT TRUE... I have been dong network diagrams on windows for a while now, and thoes tools work out of the box... is there something in linux that will work out of the box as well???
2009-04-05T23:01:00.000Z	aar	todd__	i've tried to describe why it's not working. i can assure you it won't work in linux, windows or a mac. if you're comfortable with out-of -the-box products you might be better of using windows
2009-04-05T23:02:00.000Z	todd__	aar	lol... no wonder everyone is using windows, I am really getting tired of having to fight to get things done :-(
2009-04-05T23:03:00.000Z	todd__	aar	is it BSOD or kill yourself to lift a finger? isnt there something better at this point??? really???
2009-04-05T23:05:00.000Z	aar	todd__	have u understood the conversation between ultraj6 and me? we have made it very clear why you can't currently map your network (rgardless of the OS you use). we have also suggested a possible alternative (albeit a rather complex one). what hae you not understood?
2009-04-05T23:25:00.000Z	aar	todd__	why don't you?
