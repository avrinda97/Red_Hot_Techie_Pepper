2010-09-20T09:44:00.000Z	Chippy		sure you're not the guy hacking me nogo?
2010-09-20T09:44:00.000Z	Chippy		probably related to the rootkit
2010-09-20T09:45:00.000Z	Chippy		chippy@chippy-desktop:~$ apt-get install rkhunter
2010-09-20T09:45:00.000Z	Chippy		E: Could not open lock file /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (13: Permission denied)
2010-09-20T09:45:00.000Z	Chippy		E: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), are you root?
2010-09-20T09:45:00.000Z	Chippy		my account is supposed to be the same as root
2010-09-20T09:46:00.000Z	Chippy		i changed /etc/passwd so the uid is 0
2010-09-20T09:46:00.000Z	Chippy		how do i install rkhunter if apt is broken

2010-09-20T09:47:00.000Z	well_laid_lawn	Chippy	 you need to use sudo with apt-get
2010-09-20T09:54:00.000Z	Chippy	well_laid_lawn	I'm not worried about rtkit now... I'm worried about what rkhunter said.
2010-09-20T09:55:00.000Z	well_laid_lawn	Chippy	 rootkits are diff to malware
2010-09-20T09:56:00.000Z	Chippy	well_laid_lawn	explain to me what they are and why I have them please.
2010-09-20T09:56:00.000Z	well_laid_lawn	Chippy	 http://cayfer.bilkent.edu.tr/~cayfer/linux/Detecting_and_Removing_Rootkits.html - this should do that
2010-09-20T09:58:00.000Z	Chippy	well_laid_lawn	what is a suid binary and why would they be hidden?
2010-09-20T09:59:00.000Z	well_laid_lawn	Chippy	 a binary is is an executable file like windows .exe files and a setuid binary changes the permissions the file is run under - so it is like root ran it
2010-09-20T10:00:00.000Z	well_laid_lawn	Chippy	 you prob allowed the rootkit to install when you changed your user to roots id
2010-09-20T10:07:00.000Z	well_laid_lawn	Chippy	 you can make it very insecure
