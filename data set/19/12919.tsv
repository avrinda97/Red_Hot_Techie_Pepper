2005-06-15T07:29:00.000Z	shadowjack		As most are probably aware, the latest automatic updates break nvidia-glx. My solution was uninstall nvidia-glx then download the latest official NVidia drivers from nvidia.com. I also installed the kernel headers from the Ubuntu repositories because I suspected the NVidia install script would have to compile a driver for the system - and it did. Everything seemed to work but now OpenGL apps give me a "segmentation fault." I've
2005-06-15T07:29:00.000Z	shadowjack		 installed NVidia drivers many times in the past and this is a first for me. I can find very little on it with Google. What do I do?
2005-06-15T07:30:00.000Z	jetscreamer	shadowjack	did you try uninstalling the previous?
2005-06-15T07:30:00.000Z	jetscreamer	shadowjack	did you try asking in #nvidia?

2005-06-15T07:31:00.000Z	shadowjack	jetscreamer	 i wasn't aware of an #nvidia. i don't come on irc much. this is an act of desperation
2005-06-15T07:31:00.000Z	shadowjack	jetscreamer	as far as i know, the latest nvidia driver supports x.org
2005-06-15T07:32:00.000Z	jetscreamer	shadowjack	lots of useful information on irc... #nvidia might be able to help .. i've never had it break that way so i don't know... did you read the README.txt for the advanced options? it's a pretty extensive doc
2005-06-15T07:34:00.000Z	jetscreamer	shadowjack	what kernel? there used to be some conflict, but that was a little while ago
2005-06-15T07:34:00.000Z	jetscreamer	shadowjack	a wise man said to me once that updating you xserver breaks the nvidia.run
2005-06-15T07:35:00.000Z	shadowjack	jetscreamer	whatever comes stock with hoary
2005-06-15T07:35:00.000Z	jetscreamer	shadowjack	he said 'in horrible ways' iirc, not sure
2005-06-15T07:35:00.000Z	shadowjack	jetscreamer	well that's the odd thing, i didn't update x.org. at least i'm pretty sure i didn't
2005-06-15T07:36:00.000Z	jetscreamer	shadowjack	try #nvidia, might take a bit for somebody to answer, might not
2005-06-15T07:38:00.000Z	shadowjack	jetscreamer	ok, i guess i'll have to check it out
