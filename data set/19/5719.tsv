2008-05-15T18:39:00.000Z	PCDJ		anyone know how to fix samba so it does not crash?
2008-05-15T18:40:00.000Z	PCDJ		i just went to 100% ubuntu no more ntfs partition
2008-05-15T18:41:00.000Z	stbain	PCDJ	did you do that manually, or did you use LVPM?
2008-05-15T18:42:00.000Z	PCDJ	stbain	with add/remove
2008-05-15T18:43:00.000Z	stbain	PCDJ	Should have asked first... "were you using Wubi?"
2008-05-15T18:43:00.000Z	PCDJ	stbain	wubi?
2008-05-15T18:44:00.000Z	PCDJ	stbain	all i want to do is share 2 drives with the other XP computer
2008-05-15T18:44:00.000Z	stbain	PCDJ	ahh ok
2008-05-15T18:46:00.000Z	PCDJ	stbain	is there a way to share folders through network without samba?
2008-05-15T18:47:00.000Z	stbain	PCDJ	for sharing with Windows boxes, Samba is probably your best bet.
2008-05-15T18:47:00.000Z	PCDJ	stbain	but it doesn't work lol just my luck too
2008-05-15T18:48:00.000Z	PCDJ	stbain	i installed the sshshs or whatever initials are lol
2008-05-15T18:52:00.000Z	PCDJ	stbain	TY now i have to boot the other gates infected PC and see if it shared
2008-05-15T18:57:00.000Z	PCDJ	stbain	it share but other PC does not see this one
2008-05-15T18:58:00.000Z	stbain	PCDJ	I think there's a #samba channel... they'd be able to get you on track in no time flat
2008-05-15T18:58:00.000Z	PCDJ	stbain	TY
2008-05-15T18:59:00.000Z	stbain	PCDJ	Sorry I couldn't be of more help. I haven't really had to deal with Samba (or Windows for that matter) for years
2008-05-15T18:59:00.000Z	PCDJ	stbain	only my daughter's PC has microcsucks windows i am 100% linux
2008-05-15T19:00:00.000Z	stbain	PCDJ	I have a pretty even mix of Linux, Windows, Mac at home and here in my office, but the core stuff is all Linux
