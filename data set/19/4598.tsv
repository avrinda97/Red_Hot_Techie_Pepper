2009-03-19T21:49:00.000Z	Bob_Dole		I have 8 minutes before I have to leave. Can someone please hurry and give me some help?..actually, 6 minutes now
2009-03-19T21:50:00.000Z	Bob_Dole		http://pastebin.com/m5338d29f  <--- how do I fix this?
2009-03-19T21:50:00.000Z	hatter243	Bob_Dole	fix what?
2009-03-19T21:51:00.000Z	Bob_Dole		Ok, disobeying rules to make it more obvious.. The number of cylinders for this disk is set to 1216.
2009-03-19T21:51:00.000Z	Bob_Dole		There is nothing wrong with that, but this is larger than 1024,
2009-03-19T21:51:00.000Z	Bob_Dole		and could in certain setups cause problems with:
2009-03-19T21:51:00.000Z	Bob_Dole		2) booting and partitioning software from other OSs
2009-03-19T21:51:00.000Z	Bob_Dole		   (e.g., DOS FDISK, OS/2 FDISK)
2009-03-19T21:51:00.000Z	Bob_Dole		Gparted is what is having issues with that
2009-03-19T21:51:00.000Z	hatter243	Bob_Dole	you don't have to worry about that unless you're messing around with old ODs
2009-03-19T21:51:00.000Z	hatter243		OSs*
2009-03-19T21:52:00.000Z	Bob_Dole		But I can't edit the partitions, and It's going to get dd'd onto larger drives
2009-03-19T21:52:00.000Z	hatter243	Bob_Dole	what error message do you get when you attempt to edit the partition?
2009-03-19T21:52:00.000Z	Bob_Dole		I'd really like to be able to use more than 10GB of some of the 80GB drives it is going on
2009-03-19T21:52:00.000Z	Bob_Dole	hatter243	Gparted says it is ALL unallocated
2009-03-19T21:53:00.000Z	Bob_Dole		3 minutes @.@
2009-03-19T21:53:00.000Z	hatter243	Bob_Dole	the filesystem comes up as Unallocated?
2009-03-19T21:53:00.000Z	Bob_Dole	hatter243	yeah.
2009-03-19T21:54:00.000Z	hatter243	Bob_Dole	... wonder why the first command in your pastbin shows the partition type correctly
