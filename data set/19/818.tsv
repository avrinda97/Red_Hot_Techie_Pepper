2011-09-14T19:53:00.000Z	SIFTU	abstrakt	why does aptitude suck?
2011-09-14T19:54:00.000Z	abstrakt	SIFTU	because the interface is EXTREMELY non intuitive, it doesn't follow ANY kind of convention, not emacs, not vim, not anything, and the search is pretty much horrible and completely non-useful

2011-09-14T19:55:00.000Z	abstrakt	SIFTU	ncurses has basically zero to do with what hotkey commands they chose
