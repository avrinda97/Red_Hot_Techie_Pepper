2010-03-14T10:43:00.000Z	Andorin		Okay, everyone who was just helping me: Turns out we were trying to install the wrong driver, as she has a different camera than we thought. This one is supposed to work out of the box, and she's going to reboot her computer (she updated it earlier without rebooting).
2010-03-14T10:44:00.000Z	Andorin		And it turns out we had it wrong xD
2010-03-14T10:45:00.000Z	ChogyDan	Andorin	yeah, if it works in cheese at all, then you have the driver
2010-03-14T10:39:00.000Z	ChogyDan	Andorin	why did you do sudo make?
2010-03-14T10:39:00.000Z	Andorin	ChogyDan	Don't you have to?
2010-03-14T10:40:00.000Z	ChogyDan	Andorin	no, it is just make.  Have you tried gstreamer-properties?
2010-03-14T10:54:00.000Z	ChogyDan	Andorin	gstreamer-properties
2010-03-14T10:55:00.000Z	Andorin	ChogyDan	Okay. What am I going to have her change?
2010-03-14T10:55:00.000Z	ChogyDan	Andorin	are you with her?
2010-03-14T10:55:00.000Z	Andorin	ChogyDan	No, this is over IM.
2010-03-14T10:55:00.000Z	ChogyDan	Andorin	just try to get it working, it should make sense
2010-03-14T10:59:00.000Z	Andorin	ChogyDan	She says that when she clicks Test to test her video output, without changing settings, the cam works fine in that little window that pops up. But it doesn't work in Cheese. I guess the cam itself is fine?
2010-03-14T10:59:00.000Z	ChogyDan	Andorin	yep
2010-03-14T11:00:00.000Z	ChogyDan	Andorin	have her try changing some settings in cheese, or maybe use a different app
2010-03-14T11:00:00.000Z	Andorin	ChogyDan	Yep, that's exactly what we're trying now... thank you very much :)
2010-03-14T11:01:00.000Z	ChogyDan	Andorin	wait, did you say output?
2010-03-14T11:02:00.000Z	Andorin	ChogyDan	I meant input.
2010-03-14T11:02:00.000Z	ChogyDan	Andorin	kk
2010-10-31T05:26:00.000Z	ChogyDan	Andorin	maybe this build will work? https://launchpad.net/~audacity-team/+archive/daily          that isn't stable btw
