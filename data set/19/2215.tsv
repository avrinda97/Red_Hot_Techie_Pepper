2010-06-05T10:15:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mek8630	I don't understand what you mean by "it wants to run the liveCD"? What are the symptoms of the problem you are having?
2010-06-05T10:16:00.000Z	mek8630	Jordan_U	ok you know when you put a iso disc in to install Xubuntu?
2010-06-05T10:16:00.000Z	mek8630	Jordan_U	and a menu will come up and the first option will be to try xubuntu without installing
2010-06-05T10:17:00.000Z	mek8630	Jordan_U	the second option will be to install
2010-06-05T10:17:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mek8630	When you boot from the CD? Then yes, I know what you are taling about.
2010-06-05T10:18:00.000Z	mek8630	Jordan_U	well if you pick the first option it will do what I am talking about and just run the op system without installing it, if you hit install then it will install the op system, which is what I am wanting to do but itstead its just running it.
2010-06-05T10:19:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mek8630	There is very little difference between the two options from a technical perspective, and in 10.04 you are by default given the choice after X (the GUI) has started.
2010-06-05T10:21:00.000Z	mek8630	Jordan_U	yes I know what you are talking about. Being able to install once your desktop comes up. When I try to do it that way since it won't work the other way it crashes on me.
2010-06-05T10:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mek8630	You can get the screen as you would see it in previous versions by pressing a key during early boot, but there isn't much of a reason to do that.
2010-06-05T10:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mek8630	Then it will almost certainly crash with the install option also.
2010-06-05T10:22:00.000Z	mek8630	Jordan_U	I don't understand why its crashing. I mean well its not really crashing its generating errors and semi crashing.
2010-06-05T10:22:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mek8630	But if you want to try it then just press any key during early boot (when you see just the accessability icon at the bottom of the screen)
2010-06-05T10:24:00.000Z	mek8630	Jordan_U	I think it has something to do with the fact its such an old computer
2010-06-05T10:24:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mek8630	If you have integrated graphics then you just barely don't have enough ram for the liveCD installer. Try the alternate (text based) install CD
2010-06-05T10:25:00.000Z	Jordan_U		!alternate | mek8630
2010-06-05T10:26:00.000Z	mek8630	Jordan_U	ubottu: I can't use this cd to switch to that one you are talking about some how?
2010-06-05T10:26:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mek8630	No.
2010-06-05T10:27:00.000Z	mek8630	Jordan_U	oh man figures....Alright well thanks for your help]
2010-06-05T10:27:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mek8630	You're welcome.
