2011-11-19T13:01:00.000Z	ghostnik11		hi i am running a dell optiplex gx240 and for  some reason lubuntu doesn't see that my cd rom drive is on, I wish to burn a puppy linux disc but when i go to the burner software it says my cd rom drive is not there but in the bios its shown to be on and not disabled
2011-11-19T13:02:00.000Z	ghostnik11		how do you mount cd rom drive
2011-11-19T13:03:00.000Z	bekks	ghostnik11	If the burning software tells you your cdrom is missing, you cannot mount it.
2011-11-19T13:04:00.000Z	ghostnik11	bekks	uh, is there a way i can manually force mount it
2011-11-19T13:04:00.000Z	bekks	ghostnik11	Please read again what I wrote.
2011-11-19T13:06:00.000Z	ghostnik11	bekks	i don't get it though, if the bios shows it enabled then how come it doesn't become automatically loaded?
2011-11-19T13:07:00.000Z	bekks	ghostnik11	Because it maybe broken.
2011-11-19T13:07:00.000Z	ghostnik11	bekks	but i installed lubuntu onto it using a cd
2011-11-19T13:08:00.000Z	bekks	ghostnik11	What is the output of the command you were suggested to run?
2011-11-19T13:09:00.000Z	ghostnik11	bekks	The program 'wodim' is currently not installed.  You can install it by typing:
2011-11-19T13:09:00.000Z	bekks	ghostnik11	Why dont you install it then?
2011-11-19T13:11:00.000Z	ghostnik11	bekks	wait just installed it will do a pastebin to show output its weird what it says i can and can't do with this cd rom drive on this old computer
2011-11-19T13:11:00.000Z	bekks	ghostnik11	a cdrom drive isnt a cdrom burning device necessarily.
2011-11-19T13:12:00.000Z	ghostnik11	bekks	http://paste.ubuntu.com/743018/
2011-11-19T13:15:00.000Z	bekks	ghostnik11	No chance to burn anything with that device.
2011-11-19T13:20:00.000Z	bekks	ghostnik11	You will loose the entire ubuntu support doing so.
2011-11-19T13:20:00.000Z	ghostnik11	bekks	how so?
2011-11-19T13:21:00.000Z	bekks	ghostnik11	Because Puppy Linux isnt Ubuntu.
2011-11-19T13:23:00.000Z	ghostnik11	bekks	yeah i know its not ubuntu but there puppy linux lucid edition is supposedly linked with the ubuntu repositories, so even though i might lose the support i will still be able to get into the repositories and get the things that i need from ubuntu or that come pre installed with ubuntu
