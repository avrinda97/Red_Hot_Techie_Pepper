2006-10-31T17:54:00.000Z	B_166-ER-X		ok, i just installed edgy (harder than expected..)   but , i have no idea why, i have no sound at all (it was working as always on dapper before )     any idea?
2006-10-31T17:55:00.000Z	troxor	B_166-ER-X	what does alsamixer -c 0 do?
2006-10-31T17:58:00.000Z	B_166-ER-X		!paste
2006-10-31T06:00:00.000Z	B_166-ER-X	troxor	sorry, was looking fora way to showyou the screenshot wel... the command does what it supposed to i guess, but i dont know  what to look for
2006-10-31T06:00:00.000Z	troxor	B_166-ER-X	just whatever card it's using by default... so long as a mic or webcam didn't take the first audio slot
2006-10-31T06:02:00.000Z	B_166-ER-X	troxor	i still dont have sound and not more advanced on my problem :/
2006-10-31T06:04:00.000Z	troxor	B_166-ER-X	what card is listed in alsamixer?
2006-10-31T06:04:00.000Z	B_166-ER-X		!sound
2006-10-31T06:04:00.000Z	B_166-ER-X	troxor	i dont see that anywhere
2006-10-31T06:05:00.000Z	troxor	B_166-ER-X	did you do that which !sound mentioned?
2006-10-31T06:06:00.000Z	B_166-ER-X	troxor	yup .. and i changed the default to my SBlive! soundcard
2006-10-31T06:06:00.000Z	B_166-ER-X		still no sound
2006-10-31T06:06:00.000Z	troxor	B_166-ER-X	volume levels, speakers plugged  in, etc? ;)
2006-10-31T06:07:00.000Z	B_166-ER-X	troxor	yup, and i was working in dapper a few hours ago..
2006-10-31T06:08:00.000Z	troxor	B_166-ER-X	have you played with the switches in the volume control?

2006-10-31T06:08:00.000Z	troxor	B_166-ER-X	sometimes there's a digital out thing
2006-10-31T06:09:00.000Z	B_166-ER-X		nope, i didnt touch anything ( i think)
2006-10-31T06:10:00.000Z	troxor	B_166-ER-X	it looks like your default card is the SiS one (probably onboard)..  in sound preferences, is everything set to autodetect, or to your sblive?
