2006-01-23T07:22:00.000Z	stevenj		is anyone "testing" dapper flight 3?
2006-01-23T07:23:00.000Z	cafuego	stevenj	i've got a daily build from the same day flight3 was released, does that count?
2006-01-23T07:24:00.000Z	stevenj	cafuego	thats works..just downloaded last night....everything seems to be going just fine until x server will not work.  I have a nvidia 5200 (Nothing exotic!) do you know something I can do to get X working?
2006-01-23T07:25:00.000Z	cafuego	stevenj	Installed nvidia-glx?
2006-01-23T07:25:00.000Z	stevenj	cafuego	please dont tell me its that simple
2006-01-23T07:25:00.000Z	cafuego	stevenj	it's not that simple
2006-01-23T07:25:00.000Z	cafuego	stevenj	Well, it is, but I'm not telling you ;-)
2006-01-23T07:26:00.000Z	stevenj	cafuego	ok..err..also when I do a clean install and sudo apt-get update update...something is not working 1. The US servers are crap or 2. something else any suggestions?
2006-01-23T07:27:00.000Z	cafuego	stevenj	Use other servers (yes, the US are crap)
2006-01-23T07:27:00.000Z	stevenj	cafuego	guess that settles it then...going to reinstall. (Vi makes me nervous) but I guess I'll manage :)
2006-01-23T07:28:00.000Z	cafuego	stevenj	If you dislike vi, use nano ;-)
2006-01-23T07:29:00.000Z	cafuego	stevenj	use 'nano' wherever the manual refers to vi.
2006-01-23T07:29:00.000Z	cafuego	stevenj	much easier to use
2006-01-25T11:41:00.000Z	cafuego	stevenj	Don't use dapper unless you can fix stuff like that by yourself?
2006-01-25T11:42:00.000Z	stevenj	cafuego	I have multiple boxes...I'm just testing it out..having "fun" its not like I lose any sleep over it...but I ran though the common fixes.  In fact I figured out that dapper will not even boot for me unless I move my usb mouse to another port ;)
2006-01-25T11:42:00.000Z	cafuego	stevenj	<heh>
2006-01-25T11:43:00.000Z	cafuego	stevenj	I expect the fix would be to run 2.6.15-12 until the driver is fixed.
2006-01-25T11:44:00.000Z	stevenj	cafuego	yes I figured that was it...prolly should have waited a few days on the last dist-upgrade
2006-01-25T11:46:00.000Z	stevenj	cafuego	the only thing that has ever made me lose sleep is configuring a damn KDE...never again. ;)
