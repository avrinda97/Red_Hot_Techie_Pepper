2008-04-11T01:48:00.000Z	Totem	GrueTamer	They aren't installed yet, that's the problem. I try to install and I get this error: X Server: unable to detect
2008-04-11T01:50:00.000Z	GrueTamer	Totem	did you get the drivers from the repos or from a website?
2008-04-11T01:51:00.000Z	Totem	GrueTamer	the ati website. I did the X reconfigure. Should I just hit enter a whole bunch of times or do I really need to enter anything?
