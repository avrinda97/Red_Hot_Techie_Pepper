2009-04-28T09:11:00.000Z	usr13	Gartral1	Try:  apt-cache search flashplayer
2009-04-28T09:12:00.000Z	Gartral1	usr13	flashplugin-nonfree-extrasound...
2009-04-28T09:12:00.000Z	usr13	Gartral1	There you go....
2009-04-28T09:13:00.000Z	Gartral1	usr13	its also already installed and up to date
2009-04-28T09:13:00.000Z	usr13	Gartral1	So from that, we assume that you can do: sudo apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree
2009-04-28T09:14:00.000Z	usr13	Gartral1	Guess it doesn't work:  sudo apt-get remove flashplugin-nonfree
2009-04-28T09:14:00.000Z	Gartral1	usr13	all of these are up to date, but firefox isnt seeing them
2009-04-28T09:16:00.000Z	usr13	Gartral1	 See that you've done all your updates, (see that firefox is up-to-date): sudo apt-get upgrade firefox
2009-04-28T09:16:00.000Z	usr13	Gartral1	ANd then maybe re-install flashplugin-nonfree   i.e.  sudo apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree
2009-04-28T09:17:00.000Z	usr13	Gartral1	Upgrade
2009-04-28T09:17:00.000Z	Gartral1	usr13	upgrade or update?
2009-04-28T09:17:00.000Z	Gartral1	usr13	its up to date
2009-04-28T09:18:00.000Z	usr13	Gartral1	Ok now re-install flashplugin-nonfree and see if it works.
2009-04-28T09:19:00.000Z	usr13	Gartral1	Close any firefox browser windows b4 installing flashplugin-nonfree
2009-04-28T09:21:00.000Z	Gartral1	usr13	still not working, and firefox needs an internal plugin installed
2009-04-28T09:22:00.000Z	Gartral1	usr13	why are you pointing that at me?
2009-04-28T09:24:00.000Z	usr13	Gartral1	ls /usr/lib/firefox/plugins/
2009-04-28T09:25:00.000Z	Gartral1	usr13	i have flashplugin-alternative.so and libjavaplugin.so...
2009-04-28T09:25:00.000Z	Gartral1	usr13	and the vid im trying is just loading forever
