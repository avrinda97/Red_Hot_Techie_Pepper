2006-06-23T05:44:00.000Z	orbin	dngldoof	seen this: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DapperUpgrades ?
2006-06-23T05:46:00.000Z	dngldoof	orbin	yes, I'm working on it.. I'm currently using version 0.37 something on update manager (breezy) and when I try to reinstall, Ubuntu tells me to insert the 5.10 install CD
2006-06-23T05:46:00.000Z	orbin	dngldoof	remove/disable the cd from your repository list
2006-06-23T05:47:00.000Z	orbin	dngldoof	then update/reload
2006-06-23T05:47:00.000Z	dngldoof	orbin	I'll try
2006-06-23T05:58:00.000Z	dngldoof	orbin	now I'm trying with the cd-option off. First I tried to edit the sources.list, but it didn't solve anything..
2006-07-23T08:53:00.000Z	orbin	dngldoof	as in the libs?
2006-07-23T08:54:00.000Z	dngldoof	orbin	i've installed Glibs and Pango, but GTK keeps on complaining that I should install GLIB 2.13, which doesn't exist (or am I wrong)
2006-07-23T08:55:00.000Z	orbin	dngldoof	what do you mean by gtk complains?  what are you trying to install/get working?
2006-07-23T08:57:00.000Z	dngldoof	orbin	I've been trying to install some audio processing tools (Jackbeat, spiral modular etc), but every program I've tried lacks some packages, and when I try to install the packages I find that there are yet more packages missing.
2006-07-23T08:58:00.000Z	dngldoof	orbin	and I think I should first update my GTK+ to the latest version, but even it doesn't work
2006-07-23T08:58:00.000Z	orbin	dngldoof	step 1: check if the app is already in the repos.  jackbeat and spiralsynthmodular pacakges are in there.
2006-07-23T08:58:00.000Z	dngldoof	orbin	k
2006-07-23T08:59:00.000Z	orbin	dngldoof	only reason i build an app is if i can't find it in the repos
2006-07-23T08:59:00.000Z	orbin	dngldoof	you'd have to pastebin the errors you're getting for configure for me to take a stab at what you need, but like i said,   jsut get it from the repos.  it's so much easier
2006-07-23T09:00:00.000Z	dngldoof	orbin	ok, I'll try. Thanks
2006-07-23T09:00:00.000Z	orbin	dngldoof	yw.
2006-07-23T09:02:00.000Z	dngldoof	orbin	but yeah, the servers are down.. so I quess I'll try to install 'em later
2006-07-23T09:02:00.000Z	orbin	dngldoof	sure
