2005-04-13T13:06:00.000Z	AcidWolf		so if one doesnt work for you then you do have another option to try :)
2005-04-13T13:06:00.000Z	yfir	AcidWolf	it depends on what his(her?) service provider provides.
2005-04-13T13:07:00.000Z	AcidWolf	yfir	most ISP's support everything unless your going for a smaller ISP
2005-04-13T14:36:00.000Z	AcidWolf	yfir	does totem-xine do .ASF
2005-04-13T14:59:00.000Z	yfir	AcidWolf	win32codecs? you'll need them to run .asf I think
2005-04-29T13:33:00.000Z	yfir	AcidWolf	it's actually very easy to manually edit your own menu file
2005-04-29T13:30:00.000Z	yfir	AcidWolf	i set it up on my machine. what do you need to know?
2005-04-29T13:31:00.000Z	yfir	AcidWolf	you have to manually edit the menu or (haven't tried it) get download the menu editor
2005-04-29T13:31:00.000Z	yfir	AcidWolf	there should be example menu files in /usr/share/fluxbox/ or somewhere like that
2005-04-29T13:32:00.000Z	yfir	AcidWolf	package fluxconf comes with a menu editor, but i haven't tried it so...
