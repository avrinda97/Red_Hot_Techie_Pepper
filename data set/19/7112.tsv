2007-10-21T10:35:00.000Z	kwtm	LiMaO	Might be useful to post your script on the Ubuntu forums?
2007-10-21T10:35:00.000Z	LiMaO	kwtm	it's still there.
2007-10-21T10:35:00.000Z	LiMaO	kwtm	er, i mean it's already there
2007-10-21T10:36:00.000Z	kwtm	LiMaO	Good job.  I am still using a 32-bit system but may one day end up using your script. :)
2007-10-21T10:36:00.000Z	LiMaO	kwtm	i'll be around.. if you have any questions at any time, just tell me =) i'll be glad to try and help ya
2007-10-21T10:37:00.000Z	kwtm	LiMaO	So ... would you be able to help me with my question, above?
2007-10-21T10:39:00.000Z	LiMaO	kwtm	have you tried using Ark?
2007-10-21T10:39:00.000Z	kwtm	LiMaO	Actually, funny you ask that --I came here because I was frustrated using Ark.  Two main problems:
2007-10-21T10:40:00.000Z	kwtm	LiMaO	Apparently it doesn't support adding to .tar.bz2 files (what the heck!?  I can only create an archive once and not add to it?)  And the second thing is
2007-10-21T10:40:00.000Z	kwtm	LiMaO	Ark says I've run out of disk space.  I don't know why; I have lots of disk space.  I suspect that it's using a temporary file that's on one of my drives that's almost full, but I don't know how to specify the temporary file.
2007-10-21T10:41:00.000Z	LiMaO	kwtm	i never used it, but some people say xarchive is good
2007-10-21T10:41:00.000Z	kwtm	LiMaO	There are no settings for specifying the temp file.  So now it's completely useless.
2007-10-21T10:41:00.000Z	kwtm	LiMaO	Okay, will check out Xarchive.
2007-10-21T10:43:00.000Z	LiMaO	kwtm	xarchiver is the package.. just checked it out
2007-10-21T10:44:00.000Z	kwtm	LiMaO	Yes, I just checked it in Adept.  Looks like "xarchive" is the shell script wrapper, and "xarchiver" is the one with built-in.  Will apt-get install it now.
2007-10-21T10:59:00.000Z	kwtm	LiMaO	Tried Xarchiver.  Unfortunately, it is not drag&drop.  Will continue to try to use Ark and figure out how to specify the temporary file.  Thanks, though.
2007-10-21T11:00:00.000Z	LiMaO	kwtm	you're welcome. sorry if i don't know of any other better app that would suit to your needs.
2007-10-21T11:02:00.000Z	kwtm	LiMaO	Not your fault.  Just wish the KDE people would have made decent documentation for their programs.  Not like "Manual, Chapter 3: the 'Wigglywoo' menu option.  This option allows you to use the 'Wigglywoo' command."  Like, no, DUHHHhhhh!!!  I really needed a manual to tell me that!
2007-10-21T11:02:00.000Z	LiMaO	kwtm	lol, that's true
