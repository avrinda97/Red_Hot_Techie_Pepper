2007-01-04T16:08:00.000Z	fooy		this is the most f'd up thing a computer has ever done to me. i spent 3 days organizing my files and copying them from my windows partition to my linux partition. i'm able to access my linux partition from windows using ext2/ext3 drivers. then when im finally FINNISHED, i reboot into linux and kde refuses to load for no reason (i shutdown proeperly last time) Then i go back in win2k and it now refuses to let me access my ext3 partition
2007-01-04T16:08:00.000Z	fooy		so now i can't perform a backup
2007-01-04T16:09:00.000Z	fooy		nope
2007-01-04T16:09:00.000Z	mnoir	fooy	what where you using to access ext3 from win?
2007-01-04T16:09:00.000Z	fooy		nope
2007-01-04T16:09:00.000Z	fooy		it just crashes
2007-01-04T16:09:00.000Z	fooy	mnoir	some program called ext2fs or something
2007-01-04T16:10:00.000Z	fooy		when i try to access my linux partition from explorer (which it shows up as a G: drive) instead of  letting me explore it like it was before, it not just pops up a message 'would you like to format the volume? yes/no'
2007-01-04T16:10:00.000Z	mnoir	fooy	accessing ext3 with an ext2 pgm?
2007-01-04T16:10:00.000Z	fooy		it does both
2007-01-04T16:10:00.000Z	fooy		and i was accessing it fine before
2007-01-04T16:10:00.000Z	mnoir		mmkay
2007-01-04T16:11:00.000Z	fooy		ie an hour ago
2007-01-04T16:12:00.000Z	fooy		these are both week old installs of windows and ubuntu, i have no viruses or did anythin crazy to cause both kde to stop working and windows to stop lettin me access my ext3 partition, they just decided to both do this crap at the same time because i spent 3 long days organizing my stuff and was just about to backit up to dvd. computers hate me is the only explantion
2007-01-04T16:12:00.000Z	mnoir	fooy	were you sharing your root partition or a different one?
2007-01-04T16:12:00.000Z	fooy		no
2007-01-04T16:12:00.000Z	fooy		i did nothin out of the ordinary
2007-01-04T16:13:00.000Z	fooy		it better not be i swear to god i'll throw my computer out the window if it wasted 3 days of my life
2007-01-04T16:13:00.000Z	mnoir	fooy	there is no ordinary for this except never share yer root
