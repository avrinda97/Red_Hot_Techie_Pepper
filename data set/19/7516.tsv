2007-10-08T14:16:00.000Z	nikolam		WHY I cant upgrade gamin to 0.1.9 version if I use fiesty - 7.04
2007-10-08T14:16:00.000Z	nikolam		Gamin is uding my Whole CPU!
2007-10-08T14:17:00.000Z	nikolam		gam_server is killing my system
2007-10-08T14:18:00.000Z	nikolam		I am killing gam_server 10 times a day, Ubuntu is a buggy mess..
2007-10-08T14:18:00.000Z	scguy318	nikolam	file a bug?
2007-10-08T14:19:00.000Z	nikolam	scguy318	I will rather throw computer out of window. Bug exist for about a Year >:*-(
2007-10-08T14:21:00.000Z	scguy318	nikolam	huh?
2007-10-08T14:21:00.000Z	scguy318	nikolam	if you boot into single-user mode, you wont get asked for a password, no questions asked
2007-10-08T14:21:00.000Z	scguy318	nikolam	that's by design
2007-10-08T14:22:00.000Z	nikolam	scguy318	Thats just wrong by design and insecure that I am so pissed.
2007-10-08T14:23:00.000Z	scguy318	nikolam	then take it out of your menu.lst
2007-10-08T14:23:00.000Z	scguy318	nikolam	if a person has physical access to a machine, that machine's security is busted tbh
2007-10-08T14:24:00.000Z	nikolam	scguy318	Thank you for advice but i just SET root password in System>Users And groups menu :-I
2007-10-08T14:24:00.000Z	scguy318	nikolam	that's fine, though it doesn't mean anything if you boot in single-user
2007-10-08T14:40:00.000Z	nikolam	scguy318	You are wrong. 64-bit it working Just FINE on Ubuntu. Everything works. It is beacouse of binary Windblows prop. codecs.
2007-10-08T14:40:00.000Z	scguy318	nikolam	except Flash
2007-10-08T14:41:00.000Z	nikolam	scguy318	Flash works fine on 64bit. i use some script/workaround
2007-10-08T14:41:00.000Z	scguy318	nikolam	I know, but the workaround has rendering issues for me
2007-10-08T14:41:00.000Z	nikolam	scguy318	I dunno, sometimes it does.. have issues, so I open new windows etc
