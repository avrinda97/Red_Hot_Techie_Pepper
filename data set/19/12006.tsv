2005-10-23T11:11:00.000Z	cocox		so dudes, i typed "sudo pass" and set up my sudo pass... after that i use it in a root terminal doing something like this... for example "sudo ping google.com" and it does it, but i dont get the point of use of this command if dont even ask me for a password... so, would any user use it like a root ? or is that now i have a root shell just like the "su" command... I READ THE DIFFERENSES but im pretty confuse about this...
2005-10-23T11:12:00.000Z	cocox		ohhh i see.... and can i change it or something ?
2005-10-23T11:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cocox	 you mean you ran 'sudo passwd' ?
2005-10-23T11:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cocox	 you just set up the root user with a dirrect login password then.
2005-10-23T11:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cocox	 as far as i know. Its considered a security issue by the ubuntu guys.. but not many other disrtos worry about it.
2005-11-28T12:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cocox	 if you removed the disk befor umounting it - the systemmay be confised.. may be easiest to just reboot.
2005-11-28T12:48:00.000Z	cocox	Dr_Willis	there is no other way to make this ?
2006-05-23T10:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cocox	 i do all the time. :P
2006-05-23T10:07:00.000Z	cocox	Dr_Willis	i dont understand you, are you saying that you use for everything the first account that you made?
2006-05-23T10:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cocox	 i have just the 1 user i made.
2006-05-23T10:07:00.000Z	cocox	Dr_Willis	and you that would be ok ???
2006-05-23T10:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cocox	 theres notthing special about that user having the sudo password as well.
2006-05-23T10:10:00.000Z	cocox	Dr_Willis	but for me its a problem to have the same pass for a simple account and my root account
2006-05-23T10:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cocox	 then make a new account its no big deal either way
2006-05-23T10:12:00.000Z	cocox	Dr_Willis	yes i know :S i just was wondering about this issue thnx anyway
2006-05-23T10:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cocox	 its a non-issue :P
