2009-11-02T05:11:00.000Z	oscar___		can anyone tell me how to stop grub from loading when I turn on the computer?
2009-11-02T05:11:00.000Z	cellofellow	oscar___	you mean so it hides the menu?
2009-11-02T05:12:00.000Z	cellofellow	oscar___	cause if GRUB doesn't load, then Linux won't load, and Ubuntu won't load.
2009-11-02T05:12:00.000Z	oscar___	cellofellow	I understand, I don'tw ant ubuntu to load
2009-11-02T05:12:00.000Z	cellofellow	oscar___	so you mean you want to completely remove Ubuntu?
2009-11-02T05:12:00.000Z	cellofellow	oscar___	or just default to something else?
2009-11-02T05:12:00.000Z	oscar___	cellofellow	default to something else would be preferable
2009-11-02T05:13:00.000Z	oscar___	cellofellow	I need to test something, but grub is getting in the way
2009-11-02T05:13:00.000Z	cellofellow	oscar___	ok...
2009-11-02T05:13:00.000Z	cellofellow	oscar___	test what?
2009-11-02T05:13:00.000Z	oscar___	cellofellow	I need to run this recovery partition but when I try to , grub menu loads up and the recovery process stops
2009-11-02T05:14:00.000Z	oscar___	cellofellow	the recovery parition is to recover a windows partition
2009-11-02T05:14:00.000Z	cellofellow	oscar___	ok. GRUB is installed in the MBR of your hard drive, outside of any partitions. You may be able to add the recovery partition as a Windows system to GRUB.
2009-11-02T05:15:00.000Z	oscar___	cellofellow	oh okay, how would I do that if you don't mind ? thanks
2009-11-02T05:15:00.000Z	cellofellow	oscar___	just a sec
2009-11-02T05:17:00.000Z	cellofellow	oscar___	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
2009-11-02T05:17:00.000Z	oscar___	cellofellow	thanks I'll check that out
2009-11-02T05:18:00.000Z	cellofellow	oscar___	if you already have Windows installed and set up in GRUB you should be able to copy the Windows option that already exists and modify it for your recovery partition.
2009-11-02T05:19:00.000Z	oscar___	cellofellow	okay I will try that, thank you
