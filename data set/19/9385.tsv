2007-01-19T09:17:00.000Z	dromer		anyone: ever since I moved my /home to a different partition yesterday, Thunderbird keeps crashing every time I try to read  mail (if I don't touch it it stays on)
2007-01-19T09:17:00.000Z	cypher1	dromer	is the thunderbird mails are located at /home ?
2007-01-19T09:17:00.000Z	dromer	cypher1	afaik
2007-01-19T09:18:00.000Z	cypher1	dromer	you can create a symbolic link named "home" to the moved place
2007-01-19T09:18:00.000Z	dromer	cypher1	the partition is mounted on /home
2007-01-19T09:18:00.000Z	cypher1	dromer	ah
2007-01-19T09:18:00.000Z	dromer		I can open htunderbird, it even reads new mail, but as soon as I open the mail ..or I mean after about 5 secs it just closes without warning
2007-01-19T09:19:00.000Z	cypher1	dromer	so the directory path needed by thunderbird has not changed ?
2007-01-19T09:19:00.000Z	dromer		nope
2007-01-19T09:19:00.000Z	dromer		and afaik everything was copied to the new dir as well (all dot folders etc.)
2007-01-19T09:20:00.000Z	cypher1	dromer	so a new partition was mounted on /home and then all the data in the old /home were copied to it.. am i right
2007-01-19T09:20:00.000Z	cypher1	dromer	what does you mount command shows ?
2007-01-19T09:23:00.000Z	dromer	cypher1	yes, I'm not sure what commands I used to copy the files, I found one on google
2007-01-19T09:24:00.000Z	cypher1	dromer	can you please check whether the permissions of folders and files are proper ?
2007-01-19T09:24:00.000Z	cypher1	dromer	i guess you would be safe if the copy was something like "cp -p -R ..."
2007-01-19T09:25:00.000Z	dromer	cypher1	no it was more complicated, first there was a complete list made with find, then it was copied to the partition with cpio
2007-01-19T09:25:00.000Z	cypher1	dromer	ok.. not sure of it
2007-01-19T09:26:00.000Z	dromer	cypher1	a complete archive was made to ensure all hidden files where copied
2007-01-19T09:26:00.000Z	cypher1	dromer	check the directory used by thunderbird.. then from /home check you are allowed to traverse and open the files like inbox.. etc
