2004-10-16T14:08:00.000Z	mwilson		What *is* the big deal you have with gdesklets?
2004-10-16T14:10:00.000Z	mwilson		Karamba requires KDE, which kind of defeats the purpose.
2004-10-16T14:10:00.000Z	lypie	mwilson	gnome sucks anyways. use kde :) :P
2004-10-16T14:10:00.000Z	mwilson	lypie	Why would I use either one?

2004-10-16T14:15:00.000Z	lypie	mwilson	i'm the kde coder thats read 20% of gnomes cvs
2004-10-16T14:15:00.000Z	mwilson	lypie	Oh, then Gnome *didn't* screw things up for their 2.0 release by insisting on technical changes at the expense of their users?  My mistake... I guess all the publicity they got about that was all in my mind.
2004-10-16T14:20:00.000Z	mwilson	lypie	And when there's actually some here, you can go right ahead and hate it.
2004-10-16T14:22:00.000Z	lypie	mwilson	dimwit. i chat to most of the gnome devels
2004-10-16T14:22:00.000Z	mwilson	lypie	You're the one who said it, not me.  So, apparently it's not complete crap, then?
2004-10-16T14:23:00.000Z	lypie	mwilson	i was just being annoying while u seem to actually believe yourself :P
2004-10-16T14:23:00.000Z	mwilson	lypie	So I shouldn't believe myself when I say that Gnome is about excellence, then?
2004-10-16T14:23:00.000Z	mwilson	lypie	You really have an odd way of looking at things.
2004-10-16T14:25:00.000Z	lypie	mwilson	idiot
