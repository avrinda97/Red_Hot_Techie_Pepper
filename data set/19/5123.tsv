2008-08-28T07:33:00.000Z	dunn357		no, wired connection
2008-08-28T07:34:00.000Z	dunn357		through linksys router
2008-08-28T07:34:00.000Z	dunn357		i should note that all other computers on said router are running fine
2008-08-28T07:34:00.000Z	dunn357		i :)
2008-08-28T07:35:00.000Z	dunn357		nope, os x and xp
2008-08-28T07:35:00.000Z	dunn357		will do, sec (using laptop, ubuntu on desktop)
2008-08-28T07:35:00.000Z	dunn357		bash: ipconfig: command not found
2008-08-28T07:36:00.000Z	dunn357		oo
2008-08-28T07:36:00.000Z	dunn357		hahahaha
2008-08-28T07:36:00.000Z	dunn357		:) ok ran it
2008-08-28T07:36:00.000Z	leo_rockway	dunn357	the opposite happens to me when I try to use command.com
2008-08-28T07:36:00.000Z	dunn357		i got: eth0, eth0:avahi
2008-08-28T07:36:00.000Z	dunn357		and lo
2008-08-28T07:37:00.000Z	dunn357		leorockway: :D
2008-08-28T07:37:00.000Z	dunn357		i see the MAC address (tho its called something else), eth0:avahi shows ipaddresses and mask
2008-08-28T07:37:00.000Z	dunn357		eth0 does not
2008-08-28T07:40:00.000Z	dunn357	bofh80	that's what was confusing me, i have no idea what eth0:avahi is, it comes in after the information for eth0 (where ud think eth1 would be, for example), this entry has a corresponding inet addr:<numbers here> and bcast:<...> and mask:<..> whereas eth0, the one you asked about, does not
2008-08-28T07:40:00.000Z	dunn357		does that make any sense?
2008-08-28T07:40:00.000Z	leo_rockway	dunn357	maybe you are better off pastebinning your output
