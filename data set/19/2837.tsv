2010-04-15T07:14:00.000Z	Nitsuga	hiexpo	you can install de win32 codecs from Medibuntu
2010-04-15T07:27:00.000Z	Nitsuga	hiexpo	you mean ripping o making disk images? For ripping I recommend HandBrake.
2010-04-15T07:28:00.000Z	Nitsuga	hiexpo	for imaging there are a lot of good programs. If you want to make a dual layer dvd fit ina  normal dvd you can use dvd::rip. It also works for ripping, but I like HandBrake for that.
2010-04-15T07:33:00.000Z	Nitsuga	hiexpo	or save an image and burn it with a linux program. For my ripping needs HandBrake (dvd to hd) and k9copy (dl-dvd(s) to normal dvd(s)) are fine.
2010-04-15T07:34:00.000Z	hiexpo	Nitsuga	ok
2010-04-15T07:35:00.000Z	Nitsuga	hiexpo	if you need something more advanced you will have 3 options: 1) use windows 2) use wine to make an ISO and burn it with another program 3) code a better tool :P
2010-04-15T07:35:00.000Z	Nitsuga	hiexpo	as long as you installed libdvdcss2 from medibuntu they can handle encryption.
