2010-03-19T05:32:00.000Z	NonHomogenized		I'm trying to get an ADSL connection working in ubuntu, and having little success. Can anyone help?
2010-03-19T05:33:00.000Z	Losha	NonHomogenized	maybe. What's your hardware setup...
2010-03-19T05:34:00.000Z	Losha	NonHomogenized	well, both I suppose...
2010-03-19T05:37:00.000Z	NonHomogenized	Losha	processor is Intel Atom 330, with 2 gigs of pc6400 ram, using some foxconn-provided mobo with an intel 945GC northbridge and a realtek 8100C ethernet port. DSL modem is a cisco 677
2010-03-19T05:38:00.000Z	Losha	NonHomogenized	yes, how are they connected: modem <---> router <--> pc or something else? Ethernet or wireless?
2010-03-19T05:46:00.000Z	Losha	NonHomogenized	you never answered my question about how they were connected. As for moving things from 'here' to 'there' that doesn't really tell me much. You need to try a bit harder to help me to help you...
2010-03-19T05:47:00.000Z	NonHomogenized	Losha	I did, I guess you missed it. It's connected directly via ethernet cable from the modem to the PC
2010-03-19T05:48:00.000Z	Losha	NonHomogenized	ah, you didn't use my nick. It's hard to spot stuff when that happens. Can you ping the modem? Most modems have a default ip address like 192.168.1.100 and will server up a web page. Does yours?
2010-03-19T05:59:00.000Z	NonHomogenized	Losha	it isn't connecting to either 192.168.1.100 or 192.168.1.1, but I'm not sure what the IP for the modem should be :-/
2010-03-19T06:00:00.000Z	Losha	NonHomogenized	so how will you configure the modem?
2010-03-19T06:00:00.000Z	NonHomogenized	Losha	the modem should already be configured
2010-03-19T06:01:00.000Z	Losha	NonHomogenized	since it's apparently not working, that seems a hasty assumption....
2010-03-19T06:03:00.000Z	Losha	NonHomogenized	alright, let's suppose (and it's a big supposition) the modem is working. How does your ISP expect you to connect? PPPOE? DHCP?
2010-03-19T06:05:00.000Z	Losha	NonHomogenized	does the gui have a debug mode, or create some logs?
2010-03-19T06:09:00.000Z	Losha	NonHomogenized	from http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/hw/routers/ps295/products_quick_start09186a00800ea7fa.html, is the wan link led solid?
2010-03-19T06:10:00.000Z	NonHomogenized	Losha	it's blinking on periodically
2010-03-19T06:11:00.000Z	Losha	NonHomogenized	the troubleshooting tips say is should be on continuously....
2010-03-19T06:15:00.000Z	Losha	NonHomogenized	those are complex beasties, with lots of config options....
