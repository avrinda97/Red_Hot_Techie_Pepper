2011-06-27T10:15:00.000Z	NielsMkn		hey guys, How do I remove the grub loader and get my windows loader back?
2011-06-27T10:16:00.000Z	NielsMkn		ah can I use syslinux for this?
2011-06-27T10:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	NielsMkn	use your windows CD, ask in ##windows
2011-07-18T20:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	NielsMkn	then use a different DE
2011-07-18T20:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	NielsMkn	problem solved :D
2011-07-18T20:05:00.000Z	NielsMkn	ActionParsnip	which DE?
2011-07-18T20:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	NielsMkn	KDE, LXDE, XFCE or just go with openbox, fluxbox etc ;)
2011-07-18T20:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	NielsMkn	look at some screenshots, see which you like
2011-07-18T20:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	NielsMkn	then use that, sudo apt-get install xfce4   log off, select xfce as the session and log in
2011-07-18T20:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	NielsMkn	look at screenshots and try it, you can always add another panel if you like the double panel look
2011-07-18T20:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	NielsMkn	in short, there is more selection of desktop in Ubuntu.  More than just Gnome, I'd try a few and review
2012-06-04T21:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	NielsMkn	allows 32bit kernel to access up to 64Gb RAM with a software hack
2012-06-04T21:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	NielsMkn	you can see all the RAM but each process will only be able to see 3.2Gb RAM
2012-06-04T21:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	NielsMkn	you don't need it. 64bit CPU can access 4Eb of RAM
2012-06-05T12:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	NielsMkn	power settings in dash
2012-06-07T11:54:00.000Z	NielsMkn	ActionParsnip	can you tell me how to get 3.2.0-11.19 kernel?
2012-06-07T11:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	NielsMkn	you'll need the debs
2012-06-07T11:56:00.000Z	NielsMkn	ActionParsnip	this page https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Audio/PreciseJackDetectionTesting says that audio detection is available for that kernel version. Will the detection be there for higher versions as well?
2012-06-07T11:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	NielsMkn	Precise has a later kernel than you said, is it not in that too?
