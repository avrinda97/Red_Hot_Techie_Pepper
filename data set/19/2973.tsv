2009-11-15T08:25:00.000Z	francois		how do I find out what compiler my kernel was compiled with ?
2009-11-15T08:26:00.000Z	Wallace	francois	but not always
2009-11-15T08:26:00.000Z	Wallace	francois	why do you need to know anyway?
2009-11-15T08:27:00.000Z	francois	Wallace	I've been trying to run a script, it says my kernel and current compilers are mismatched,
2009-11-15T08:27:00.000Z	francois	Wallace	even though they're both 4.4 i think
2009-11-15T08:28:00.000Z	Wallace	francois	what script?  it may be that the kernel headers you compiler are using do not match the kernel
2009-11-15T08:29:00.000Z	francois	Wallace	its qc-messenger, a script ot install drivers for my quickcam, webcam
2009-11-15T08:29:00.000Z	francois	Wallace	how do I check to make sure my headers are matching ?
2009-11-15T08:29:00.000Z	Wallace	francois	 i'm not entirely sure tbh....have you tried the hardware updater of the preferences or administration menu?
2009-11-15T08:30:00.000Z	francois	Wallace	my camera is one that isn't supported out of the box
2009-11-15T08:30:00.000Z	francois	Wallace	only supported by that qc-messenger driver, and I Can't compile it
2009-11-15T08:31:00.000Z	Wallace	francois	yes, but sometimes it will ask you if you want to install non-open source drivers....worth a try if you haven't already
2009-11-15T08:31:00.000Z	francois	Wallace	it doesnt....nothing shows up for webcams
2009-11-15T08:32:00.000Z	Wallace	francois	hmm, i'm not really sure then...but I suspect that it's not a problem with ubuntu if you have a standard distro....I would expect it to work out of the box tbh
2009-11-15T08:33:00.000Z	Wallace	francois	you could try downloading kernel sources...if not already installed...but i'm clutching at straws here really
2009-11-15T08:34:00.000Z	francois	Wallace	yeah i know, my camera is actually turned on, but i can't get it working at all
2009-11-15T08:34:00.000Z	francois	Wallace	I have the kernel sources already installed, I always have those on hand
2009-11-15T08:36:00.000Z	Wallace	francois	i would think then that it's probably the driver / source you have isn't ubuntu friendly.  maybe search for a different version, or if that fails, you're probably going to end up hacking about with the scripts yourself...but again, i'm really guessing here
2009-11-15T08:37:00.000Z	francois	Wallace	I looked everywhere to get this webcam working, since its a 08f5, its pretty rare and often rarely supported, what a pain :(
