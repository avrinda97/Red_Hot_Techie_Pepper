2006-05-26T15:46:00.000Z	hardcorelamer	jayrod06	libfaac0 ?
2006-05-26T15:48:00.000Z	jayrod06	ompaul	that wiki talks only about faac as an aac encoder, i want quicktime encoding
2006-05-26T15:49:00.000Z	jayrod06		quicktime beat faac in listening tests
2006-05-26T15:49:00.000Z	jayrod06		what sync problems, none that i have seen
2006-05-26T15:50:00.000Z	jayrod06		does mencoder use quicktime's aac encoder?
2006-05-26T15:50:00.000Z	hardcorelamer		mencoder uses libfaac0
2006-05-26T15:50:00.000Z	jayrod06		no i dont care about movie encoding, just music
2006-05-26T15:50:00.000Z	jayrod06		yea see i dont want faac
2006-05-26T15:51:00.000Z	jayrod06		its obsolete
2006-05-26T15:51:00.000Z	jayrod06		quicktime > faac
2006-05-26T15:51:00.000Z	hardcorelamer	jayrod06	the only linux library for any aac encoding you will file is libfaac
2006-05-26T15:51:00.000Z	jayrod06		anyone have any idea where to find that?
2006-05-26T15:52:00.000Z	jayrod06		i know libfaac encodes aac files, but its encoded files are not as good as quicktime's
2006-05-26T15:53:00.000Z	hardcorelamer		quicktime is a file format, not an encoding anyways
2006-05-26T15:53:00.000Z	jayrod06		yeah right i have no idea where to begin
2006-05-26T15:53:00.000Z	jayrod06		quicktime has an aac encoder that is different from faac
2006-05-26T15:53:00.000Z	hardcorelamer		yes, so go use it
2006-05-26T15:54:00.000Z	jayrod06		how hardcorelamer, i cant find it for linux
2006-05-26T15:54:00.000Z	hardcorelamer	jayrod06	it doesn't exist for linux and it never will
