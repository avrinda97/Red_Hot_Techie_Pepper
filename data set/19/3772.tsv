2009-05-30T17:47:00.000Z	lulzSauce_		Hello, I have a Radeon X600 graphics card. How do I install the proprietary drivers for this device?
2009-05-30T17:48:00.000Z	Dillizar	lulzSauce_	go to administrator and then hardware drivers
2009-05-30T17:48:00.000Z	Dillizar	lulzSauce_	apt-get update first
2009-05-30T17:49:00.000Z	lulzSauce_	Dillizar	unfortunately it is still not an option, I just tried updating like you said.
2009-05-30T17:49:00.000Z	Dillizar	lulzSauce_	hmm 9.04?
2009-05-30T17:50:00.000Z	lulzSauce_	Dillizar	If you know the filename, I think I could install it manually.
2009-05-30T17:50:00.000Z	lulzSauce_	Dillizar	yeah, 9.04, installed yesterday
2009-05-30T17:50:00.000Z	Dillizar	lulzSauce_	i have the same problem but after reboot after the update and the upgrade i installed the drivers some times ubuntu need just a lil bit more time :P
2009-05-30T17:51:00.000Z	Dillizar	lulzSauce_	try rebooting and come back we will try smt else :P
2009-05-30T17:52:00.000Z	lulzSauce_	Dillizar	OK, I'm installing xorg-driver-fglx, I think this is the right one.
2009-05-30T17:53:00.000Z	Dillizar	lulzSauce_	when you activate the effects does it start to install the drivers??
2009-05-30T17:53:00.000Z	lulzSauce_	Dillizar	No. My effects work without the 3d driver. However, to use programs like blender, google earth, and 3d games I need the driver. I've been through quite a bit of working with this in the past.
2009-05-30T17:54:00.000Z	Dillizar	lulzSauce_	lol you must have 3d for compiz
2009-05-30T17:54:00.000Z	lulzSauce_	Dillizar	The default drivers work fine with compiz
2009-05-30T17:54:00.000Z	Dillizar	lulzSauce_	 it seems like you have installed the drivers when you were installing the ubuntu
2009-05-30T17:54:00.000Z	Dillizar	lulzSauce_	i know it does this with intel 950 chipset
2009-05-30T17:55:00.000Z	lulzSauce_	Dillizar	When I put in a totally clean, un-used ubuntu live CD, the compiz drivers work fine.
2009-05-30T17:55:00.000Z	Dillizar	lulzSauce_	so i think you are ok
2009-05-30T17:55:00.000Z	Dillizar	lulzSauce_	i think you have the drivers
