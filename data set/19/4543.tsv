2009-02-13T09:47:00.000Z	ScottG489	cpro	uuuh damn whats the name of the program....GParted. Get gparted, burn it to a disk and then boot from it
2009-02-13T09:47:00.000Z	cpro	ScottG489	so is it possible to increase my / partion without dameging my system
2009-02-13T09:47:00.000Z	cpro	ScottG489	so it wont disturb my system right
2009-02-13T09:48:00.000Z	ScottG489	cpro	Your really in luck because I just did this to increase my swap partition so I could hibernate
2009-02-13T09:48:00.000Z	ScottG489	cpro	Nope, but they do recommend that you back up your system.
2009-02-13T09:48:00.000Z	cpro	ScottG489	so takin backup will save every setting right even the eclipse
2009-02-13T09:49:00.000Z	ScottG489	cpro	Hibernate cant write to a swap file partition (which I made) so i made a larger partition for my swap. but now i cant hibernate right :( lol
2009-02-13T09:49:00.000Z	ScottG489	cpro	eclipse?
2009-02-13T09:50:00.000Z	cpro	ScottG489	i mean all the softwares
2009-02-13T09:51:00.000Z	ScottG489	cpro	Well the thing is, when changing a partitions size something can do wrong and your data can get messed up. It is generally pretty safe though. I didnt back up my system when I resized my partitions
2009-02-13T09:52:00.000Z	ScottG489	cpro	What are you trying to resize for?
2009-02-13T09:53:00.000Z	cpro	ScottG489	i had problem in disk space for a time beeing i have deleted some of my files to get the things working
2009-02-13T09:53:00.000Z	cpro	ScottG489	i will increase my / partition l8r
2009-02-13T09:53:00.000Z	ScottG489	cpro	ok good luck
2009-02-13T09:53:00.000Z	cpro	ScottG489	thanks
