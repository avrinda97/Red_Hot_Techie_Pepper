2012-11-01T17:11:00.000Z	RxDx		please, I have 2 NICs (network interfaces) connected on a router... One is connect on a PCI and another is on a miniPCI... How can I know which interface is connect on each device? I mean.. i wanna know if wlan0 is the network connect on a miniPCI or on PCI slot..
2012-11-01T17:11:00.000Z	bekks	RxDx	Connect a cable and see which interface it is.
2012-11-01T17:12:00.000Z	RxDx	bekks	there is no cables.. they are both wireless interfaces
2012-11-01T17:12:00.000Z	bekks	RxDx	Just pull out one of them...
2012-11-01T17:13:00.000Z	RxDx	bekks	u mean.. ifconfig wlan0 down?
2012-11-01T17:13:00.000Z	bekks	RxDx	By looking into your hands...
2012-11-01T17:14:00.000Z	bekks	RxDx	No. I mean "pull it out of your computer".
2012-11-01T17:14:00.000Z	RxDx	bekks	on my hands i can see both.. but i dont know if the device that im looking for is the wlan0 or the wlan1
2012-11-01T17:14:00.000Z	bekks	RxDx	Do you know the difference between PCI and miniPCI?
2012-11-01T17:14:00.000Z	RxDx	bekks	hmm, its an option.. but is there any other way without take the card off?
2012-11-01T17:15:00.000Z	RxDx	bekks	yes.. but both uses the same driver
2012-11-01T17:15:00.000Z	bekks	RxDx	And...?
2012-11-01T17:16:00.000Z	bekks	RxDx	Do you know that PCI and miniPCI have different sizes when compared to each other?
2012-11-01T17:16:00.000Z	RxDx	bekks	physical size? yes, i know
2012-11-01T17:16:00.000Z	bekks	RxDx	Then pull out ONE of them...
2012-11-01T17:17:00.000Z	bekks	RxDx	Where's the problem with that?
2012-11-01T17:17:00.000Z	RxDx	bekks	this routers could be installed on a remote location that i could not have physical access
2012-11-01T17:17:00.000Z	bekks	RxDx	But now, you have access...
2012-11-01T17:18:00.000Z	RxDx	bekks	ill have to do that way hehe.. thanks a lot :)
