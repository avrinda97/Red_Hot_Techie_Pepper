2012-11-24T09:34:00.000Z	brainard52		Hey, I've got another problem. It's been happening since.... 11.04 I think. A completely new installation doesn't help anything, so I think it might be hardware, but I've got to check just to be sure.
2012-11-24T09:35:00.000Z	brainard52		I'm on 12.10, now lol. I said that it's been happening SINCE then.
2012-11-24T09:37:00.000Z	brainard52		Whenever I'm in a virtual console, text periodically lays over whatever I'm doing. If I'm in bash, it inserts onto the next open space, and if I'm in VI or something, it just lays over starting at the tp. A redraw will make the text go away, but it still keeps coming.
2012-11-24T09:38:00.000Z	escott	brainard52	and that text says what
2012-11-24T09:38:00.000Z	brainard52		How would I copy text while in a virtual console?
2012-11-24T09:39:00.000Z	brainard52		I'll get the text, but it would be more efficient if I didn't have to write it down.
2012-11-24T09:39:00.000Z	escott	brainard52	then check dmesg
2012-11-24T09:40:00.000Z	escott	brainard52	saying there is text is about as helpful as saying "there is this window that keeps popping up"
2012-11-24T09:40:00.000Z	brainard52		Sorry, I know that.
2012-11-24T09:43:00.000Z	brainard52		http://paste.ubuntu.com/1381185/ There you go. Like I said, I assume it's got something to do with my HDD, but I'm not going to say I know for sure.
2012-11-24T09:43:00.000Z	brainard52		Well, not just for my HDD, but that it might be failing.
2012-11-24T09:46:00.000Z	escott	brainard52	you should only see that when the device connected
2012-11-24T09:46:00.000Z	escott		connects
2012-11-24T09:46:00.000Z	brainard52		That's really weird. I get it regularily.
2012-11-24T09:47:00.000Z	brainard52		sdb... I don't even have anything connected to sdb.
2012-11-24T09:47:00.000Z	brainard52		well, nothing IS sdb at the moment.
2012-11-24T09:48:00.000Z	brainard52		I've got my phone plugged in... Should I turn off debugging?
2012-11-24T09:49:00.000Z	brainard52		That would disable ADB, right?
2012-11-24T09:53:00.000Z	brainard52	escott	might it help if I turned off debugging on my phone? I've got it connected for tethering, but I think that's why it's giving me the message. That's the only device connected, and I've got a single hard drive.
