2007-11-06T10:18:00.000Z	Peddy		But it would be a hell of a lot easier than doing it from Gnome
2007-11-06T10:18:00.000Z	Peddy		reflashing, or resetting?
2007-11-06T10:19:00.000Z	Peddy		like as in new firmware, or just resetting to defaults?
2007-11-06T10:19:00.000Z	Peddy		jadeangel, did you pay for this laptop?
2007-11-06T10:20:00.000Z	Peddy		@jadeangel, are you willing to open your laptop case?
2007-11-06T10:20:00.000Z	Peddy		do you have access to the motherboard?
2007-11-06T10:20:00.000Z	Peddy		like can you see it?
2007-11-06T10:20:00.000Z	Peddy		hmm
2007-11-06T10:20:00.000Z	Peddy		what brand is your laptop?
2007-11-06T10:21:00.000Z	Peddy		@Markov use synaptic
2007-11-06T10:21:00.000Z	Markov	Peddy	okay. but, is there a reason that i cannot install from this dialog?
2007-11-06T10:22:00.000Z	Peddy	Markov	Not sure, but I can't either, neither can my laptop.
2007-11-06T10:22:00.000Z	Peddy	Markov	its a known problem
2007-11-06T10:22:00.000Z	Markov	Peddy	aah. i see. thanks!
2007-11-06T10:22:00.000Z	Peddy	Markov	Alternately, you could go applications>accessories>terminal
2007-11-06T10:24:00.000Z	Markov	Peddy	heheh. thanks. I'm trying to see how long I can go w/o apt-get
2007-11-06T10:24:00.000Z	Peddy	Markov	Does synaptic work?
2007-11-06T10:25:00.000Z	Markov	Peddy	yes. it appears to be working.
2007-11-06T10:26:00.000Z	Peddy	Markov	I think it may not work in add&remove, because the crowd at Wine did not specify a picture, and other info for add&remove
