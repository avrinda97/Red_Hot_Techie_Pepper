2009-09-29T00:52:00.000Z	shawn_		How do I update my bios if I downloaded a zip file for my motherboard and all it comes with is an exe and a .160 file...
2009-09-29T00:52:00.000Z	maco	shawn_	maybe with some sort of dos boot disk?
2009-09-29T00:53:00.000Z	shawn_	maco	Im not sure how DOS works I use Linux...
2009-09-29T00:53:00.000Z	maco	shawn_	sometimes the exe will contain an iso that you can burn and boot from
2009-09-29T00:53:00.000Z	maco	shawn_	yeah i know, but if they dont provide a linux way to do it, then youre gonna have to go to dos
2009-09-29T00:53:00.000Z	maco	shawn_	exe's are for win & dos
2009-09-29T00:53:00.000Z	shawn_	maco	So how would I do this?
2009-09-29T00:54:00.000Z	maco	shawn_	first thing id check is try unzipping the exe and maybe youre lucky and there's an iso. if not, then um...no idea how to do the dos boot disk stuf
2009-09-29T00:54:00.000Z	shawn_	maco	You can unzip an EXE?
2009-09-29T00:54:00.000Z	maco	shawn_	sure
2009-09-29T00:55:00.000Z	maco	shawn_	many .exe's are zips with an executable inside the zip
2009-09-29T00:55:00.000Z	maco	shawn_	thats how Setup.exe's work
2009-09-29T00:55:00.000Z	shawn_	maco	Oh...
2009-09-29T00:56:00.000Z	shawn_	maco	Nothing happens when I try to unzip the exe
2009-09-29T00:57:00.000Z	maco	shawn_	ok then go with what guntbert said. ask the manufacturer
2009-09-29T00:57:00.000Z	shawn_	maco	How do I contact MSI xD
2009-09-29T00:57:00.000Z	maco	shawn_	ask msi's website how to contact msi :P
2009-09-29T00:57:00.000Z	shawn_	maco	I dont see it
2009-09-29T01:06:00.000Z	maco	shawn_	no idea
