2011-07-12T08:10:00.000Z	mikubuntu		hp deskjet f4480 wont work.  running u-10.04.  gives incorrect error msg 'out of paper', but there is paper.  google searchd installed updated hplip, that din't solve the prob.  (scanner doesn't work either). anybody have any ideas? oh, also idid a power reset, no lu ck.
2011-07-12T08:11:00.000Z	soreau	mikubuntu	Does the printer itself show out of paper or just the UI interface?
2011-07-12T08:11:00.000Z	soreau		redundant..
2011-07-12T08:12:00.000Z	mikubuntu	soreau	the ui, i just lookd at the unit i don't know where it might indicate out of paper on the box itself
2011-07-12T08:13:00.000Z	soreau	mikubuntu	On my hp printer, it will show a blinking 'E' on the unit when there's a problem (such as out-of-paper)
2011-07-12T08:14:00.000Z	soreau	mikubuntu	In addition, my hp psc 1200 works beautifully with hplip
2011-07-12T08:14:00.000Z	soreau	mikubuntu	never had any problems with it
2011-07-12T08:14:00.000Z	mikubuntu	soreau	nope, nothing like that showing anywhere
2011-07-12T08:14:00.000Z	mikubuntu	soreau	yes, thats what surprises me, usually hp plays great with ubuntu
2011-07-12T08:14:00.000Z	soreau	mikubuntu	I guess it could be a driver issue but I'd suspect some configuration is confusing it
2011-07-12T08:15:00.000Z	soreau	mikubuntu	I wouldn't really know what though, as I've never had an issue
2011-07-12T08:15:00.000Z	soreau	mikubuntu	Perhaps try removing/re-adding the printer?
2011-07-12T08:15:00.000Z	mikubuntu	soreau	k, thx --- anybody else know anything about printer issues?
2011-07-12T08:15:00.000Z	mikubuntu	soreau	yeah, tried that
2011-07-12T08:15:00.000Z	soreau	mikubuntu	Check sys>admin>printers and make sure there's only a single device
2011-07-12T08:16:00.000Z	soreau		! print | mikubuntu
2011-07-12T08:17:00.000Z	mikubuntu	soreau	yes, i removed previous printers from configure
2011-07-12T08:17:00.000Z	soreau	mikubuntu	Not really sure what else to tell you other than read the links ubottu offered
2011-07-12T08:18:00.000Z	mikubuntu	soreau	yup
