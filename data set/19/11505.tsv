2006-01-10T13:38:00.000Z	hicksy		hi. I have a problem I can't get around. I was happily  going through the ubuntuguide.org and everything was going great until i tried to install some extra fonts. It gave me an error with msttcorefonts.  So now, when I am trying to install other things, it keeps going back to that and keeps getting the same error. I dont really even need those fonts. Anyone know how I can fix this? Thanks!

2006-01-10T13:39:00.000Z	hicksy	La_PaRCa	... hmm it says: Could not open lock file....
2006-01-10T13:40:00.000Z	La_PaRCa	hicksy	close synaptic first
2006-01-10T13:42:00.000Z	hicksy	La_PaRCa	....i just forgot sudo... but after I ran that command you gave me I got the same error
2006-01-10T13:43:00.000Z	La_PaRCa	hicksy	paste the error to the pastebin

2006-01-10T13:47:00.000Z	La_PaRCa	hicksy	try making the dir thats giving you the error: sudo mkdir /usr/share/X11/fonts/truetype
2006-01-10T13:48:00.000Z	La_PaRCa	hicksy	actually... um... are you behind a proxy?
2006-01-10T13:48:00.000Z	hicksy	La_PaRCa	nope no proxy
2006-01-10T13:49:00.000Z	hicksy	La_PaRCa	perhaps the actual server is down?
2006-01-10T13:49:00.000Z	La_PaRCa	hicksy	so it would seem
2006-01-10T13:49:00.000Z	La_PaRCa	hicksy	just uninstall the package and maybe try later
2006-01-10T13:49:00.000Z	hicksy	La_PaRCa	ahh yes... so what would the command for that be?
2006-01-10T13:50:00.000Z	La_PaRCa	hicksy	sudo apt-get remove msttcorefonts
2006-01-10T13:52:00.000Z	hicksy	La_PaRCa	no more annoying error. Thanks a lot!
2006-01-10T13:54:00.000Z	La_PaRCa	hicksy	it contains the MS truetype fonts. The fonts you would find in windows.
