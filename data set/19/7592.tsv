2009-06-28T10:48:00.000Z	troopperi	greenmanwitch	what is your ubuntu version?
2009-06-28T10:49:00.000Z	greenmanwitch	troopperi	8.10, hopefully. All of these problems happened after upgrading 8.04 > 8.10, but at the end it crashed so I powered off and now I dont' know what's going on
2009-06-28T10:49:00.000Z	greenmanwitch	troopperi	cat /etc/issue says 8.10
2009-06-28T10:50:00.000Z	troopperi	greenmanwitch	if you can paste xorg.conf http://paste.ubuntu.com
2009-06-28T10:51:00.000Z	greenmanwitch	troopperi	I don't think it's possible.. but it's really generic.. just what dpkg-reconfigure does..
2009-06-28T10:53:00.000Z	troopperi	greenmanwitch	have you editet your xorg.conf, change driver "ati" to "vesa"? and restart, if that help?
2009-06-28T10:53:00.000Z	greenmanwitch	troopperi	yeah, it doesn't even have a Driver line, but I'm guessing it's using vesa by default
2009-06-28T10:53:00.000Z	greenmanwitch	troopperi	not ati
2009-06-28T10:55:00.000Z	troopperi	greenmanwitch	maybe your xorg.conf file not working, do you have backup file like xorg.conf.old or something like that...
2009-06-28T10:55:00.000Z	greenmanwitch	troopperi	yeah, ok, I do but it fails
2009-06-28T10:56:00.000Z	troopperi	greenmanwitch	ok
2009-06-28T10:56:00.000Z	greenmanwitch	troopperi	hey, I added a Driver      "vesa" line and it makes my computer lock up hard in a black screen :S
2009-06-28T10:58:00.000Z	troopperi	greenmanwitch	do you have internet connection on your ubuntu pc
2009-06-28T10:58:00.000Z	greenmanwitch	troopperi	I can get one, I suppose. Maybe.
2009-06-28T11:05:00.000Z	troopperi	greenmanwitch	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=966032 if this same problem?
2009-06-28T11:10:00.000Z	greenmanwitch	troopperi	seems to apply, but the answers are really obvious things I've already tried
