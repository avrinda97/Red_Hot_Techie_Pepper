2007-06-14T05:24:00.000Z	ikonia	blueacidfrog	whats the problem
2007-06-14T05:25:00.000Z	blueacidfrog	ikonia	I cant get the widescreen to work on a laptop
2007-06-14T05:25:00.000Z	ikonia	blueacidfrog	I've had this problem and you have to use 915resolution to define a winescreen resolution so that when xorg probes it fines a winescreen mode
2007-06-14T05:26:00.000Z	blueacidfrog	ikonia	do you have a newbie manual for that ? because i tried but somehow i cant get it to work for 8 hours now
2007-06-14T05:26:00.000Z	ikonia	blueacidfrog	no - what have you done so far
2007-06-14T05:27:00.000Z	blueacidfrog	ikonia	first I installed it in synaptic -> didnt work ; then i tried to do this "sudo 915 resolution" then overwritten a mode with 1280 800
2007-06-14T05:28:00.000Z	blueacidfrog	ikonia	 then restarted the gdm
2007-06-14T05:31:00.000Z	blueacidfrog	ikonia	 http://de.gentoo-wiki.com/Cebop_HEL_950 --> this is gentoo but does this work with ubuntu too ?
2007-06-14T05:32:00.000Z	ikonia	blueacidfrog	no idea
2007-06-14T05:32:00.000Z	ikonia	blueacidfrog	took me about 1.5 hours to work out the correct settings to get the 915 video card working for my laptop
2007-06-14T05:33:00.000Z	blueacidfrog	ikonia	 loool
2007-06-14T05:33:00.000Z	blueacidfrog	ikonia	 do you have a log or something that i can work with ?
2007-06-14T05:33:00.000Z	ikonia	blueacidfrog	none of my information would help you
