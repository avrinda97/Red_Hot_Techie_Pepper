2007-02-01T12:30:00.000Z	jracico1	Stormx2	ok, i got the plugins and it shows that the songs are playing but there is no sound. do i need to install audio drivers? i just put linux on yesterday and now that i think if it i haven ever heard any sounds out of the speakers yet for anything
2007-02-01T12:31:00.000Z	Stormx2	jracico1	By default there is a startup noise. You heard that?
2007-02-01T12:31:00.000Z	jracico1	Stormx2	npe
2007-02-01T12:33:00.000Z	jracico1	Stormx2	no i have never heard a startup sound
2007-02-01T12:34:00.000Z	Stormx2	jracico1	Well check your sound volume and stuff. Do you have an icon in your gnome panels (taskbar(s)) that looks like a speaker?
2007-02-01T12:34:00.000Z	jracico1	Stormx2	ya, volume is at max
2007-02-01T12:34:00.000Z	Stormx2	jracico1	Okay. Check here:
2007-02-01T12:35:00.000Z	jracico1	Stormx2	ALSA?
2007-02-01T12:35:00.000Z	Stormx2	jracico1	Its a mixer. Lots of apps send in sound and it mixes it all together and outputs it.
2007-02-01T12:36:00.000Z	jracico1	Stormx2	k, now i have sound but i need to have my speakers on max and my volume on max to hear it...in other words its realllly quiet
2007-02-01T12:37:00.000Z	Stormx2	jracico1	Ah okay. Go into that mixer, and go into Edit>Preferences. Show the PCM control. Is it set to really low?
2007-02-01T12:38:00.000Z	jracico1	Stormx2	i cant see a PCM control
2007-02-01T12:39:00.000Z	Stormx2	jracico1	Well, I'm not sure. Enable anything and check its not really low, etc...
2007-02-01T12:40:00.000Z	jracico1	Stormx2	rythymbox, i like it more than banshee casue it looks more like itunes
2007-02-01T12:40:00.000Z	jracico1	Stormx2	better UI imo
2007-02-01T12:40:00.000Z	Stormx2	jracico1	Is there a volume control on it, etc?
2007-02-01T12:40:00.000Z	jracico1	Stormx2	ya, its at full
2007-02-01T12:40:00.000Z	Stormx2	jracico1	Just fiddle with the controls in that mixer, k?
2007-02-01T13:01:00.000Z	Stormx2	jracico1	The people in ##c?
