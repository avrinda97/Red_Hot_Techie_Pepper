2010-01-07T19:31:00.000Z	gp5st	alienkid10	from source or with apt?
2010-01-07T19:33:00.000Z	alienkid10	gp5st	with apt if possable
2010-01-07T19:34:00.000Z	alienkid10	gp5st	?
2010-01-07T19:35:00.000Z	gp5st	alienkid10	idk, i was reading a little http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com/idea/16475/
2010-01-07T19:35:00.000Z	gp5st	alienkid10	sorry:-\ any
2010-01-07T19:35:00.000Z	alienkid10	gp5st	can't?
2010-01-07T19:36:00.000Z	gp5st	alienkid10	i don't think so:(
2010-01-07T19:36:00.000Z	alienkid10	gp5st	how with source when  I do make install it install normally?
2010-01-07T19:41:00.000Z	gp5st	alienkid10	when you do ./configure you add --prefix=$HOME/bin or somwhere else you have access, then make, make install will put it where the prefix was
2010-01-07T19:42:00.000Z	alienkid10	gp5st	compiling generally take longer then the time I they have on my system
2010-01-07T19:46:00.000Z	gp5st	alienkid10	i would look into chroot jail
2010-01-07T19:46:00.000Z	alienkid10	gp5st	you can't chroot without sudo
2010-01-07T19:47:00.000Z	gp5st	alienkid10	huh? the point of chroot is that each user get's their own little world to play in
2010-01-07T19:47:00.000Z	alienkid10	gp5st	don't they need sudo to chroot?
2010-01-07T19:51:00.000Z	gp5st	alienkid10	i havn't used chroot like that, but i would imagine it would act exactly the same? i'm assuming their using xforwarding so there isn't a big difference betweena  cmd line prob and an x prog
2010-01-07T19:52:00.000Z	gp5st	alienkid10	I think it should work, it's what it was designed for. no they wouldn't be able to
2010-01-07T19:52:00.000Z	gp5st	alienkid10	i havn't used it tooo extensivly so i can't guide you much past here, but i know there are good tutorials on it
