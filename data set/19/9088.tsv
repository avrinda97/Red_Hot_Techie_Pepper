2010-11-07T21:23:00.000Z	fla		How to display grub2 custom background without the menu ? thanks
2010-11-07T21:25:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fla	 the grub2 guides/wiki pages tell how to show a image on teh grub screen.. but not sure whats the point if theres no menui
2010-11-07T21:25:00.000Z	fla	Dr_Willis	hi, i'd like to have the splash displayed during the grub loading
2010-11-07T21:26:00.000Z	fla	Dr_Willis	it only works if i display the menu before
2010-11-07T21:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fla	 gthe grub background is not a splash.. its the grub bacjkground..  normaolly the old splash showed after that.
2010-11-07T21:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fla	 and now a days plymouth is used to show the stuff.
2010-11-07T21:27:00.000Z	fla	Dr_Willis	thanks will look for plymouth
2010-11-07T21:29:00.000Z	fla	Dr_Willis	seems like plymouth is for the "ubuntu" loading screen. what about the loading stages before that ?
2010-11-07T21:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fla	 befor that is GRUB basically...
2010-11-07T21:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fla	 anything between grub and plymouth loading.. would go by so fast.. you would never see it..
2010-11-07T21:29:00.000Z	fla	Dr_Willis	ok, so it shoud be possible to have a custom grub background without having to show the menu ?
2010-11-07T21:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fla	 i dont see the point..  use a grub menu and set it to time out in 1 sec..
2010-11-07T21:31:00.000Z	fla	Dr_Willis	yes that works, but it shoud display company logo. So im trying to get rid of the menu text
2010-11-07T21:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fla	 with no grub menu shown.. it will be shown for sich a short time. i dont see the point.
2010-11-07T21:31:00.000Z	fla	Dr_Willis	nah it sticks a few seconds
2010-11-07T21:32:00.000Z	fla	Dr_Willis	without the menu, the screen goes to 800x600 (correct backg res.) but stasy black
2010-11-07T21:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fla	 thats changeable...
2010-11-07T21:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fla	 if you want a purty grub screen - check out 'burg' perhaps..
2010-11-07T21:33:00.000Z	fla	Dr_Willis	thanks
