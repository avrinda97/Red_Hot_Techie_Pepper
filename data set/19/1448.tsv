2011-01-21T04:47:00.000Z	Hilarie		Is it possible to remove the root password from my system?
2011-01-21T04:48:00.000Z	Hilarie		What are the disadvantages of removing the password?
2011-01-21T04:50:00.000Z	Hilarie		I was confusing what root was
2011-01-21T04:50:00.000Z	Hilarie		I am looking to get rid of the password to install things
2011-01-21T04:51:00.000Z	Hilarie		To not type in passwords when I am installing things, if I wanted that, I might as well use vista :P
2011-01-21T04:52:00.000Z	Hilarie		and remote exploits become much easier for malicious crackers.
2011-01-21T04:52:00.000Z	Hilarie		That's enough for me to keep it :)
2011-01-21T04:54:00.000Z	Hilarie		Do those even still exist gmg?
2011-01-21T04:56:00.000Z	Hilarie		Is it possible in ubuntu to set up music sharing that would work with win7?
2011-01-21T04:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Hilarie	sure you can use samba to share folders
2011-01-21T04:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Hilarie	there is also the web interface in VLC which allows you to remotely control what VLC plays out of the server's remote speakers (or to make it play movies ;))
2011-01-21T04:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Hilarie	yes, a share which would appear and be accessible to your LAN systems
2011-12-06T10:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Hilarie	could use snmp and go old school :)
