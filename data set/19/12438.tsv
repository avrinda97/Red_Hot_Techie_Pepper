2005-09-03T12:14:00.000Z	tommi^		Hi. I've installed mysql, added a user, granted privileges and then made a small php script. I'm getting access denied for the user from the script and from mysql-admin program. Why doesn't mysql accept user/password? Thanks
2005-09-03T12:15:00.000Z	cemc	tommi^	what does it say,
2005-09-03T12:15:00.000Z	cemc	tommi^	when you try to connect to it with mysql -u user -p
2005-09-03T12:16:00.000Z	tommi^	cemc	ERROR 1045: Access denied for user: 'tommi@localhost' (Using password: YES)
2005-09-03T12:16:00.000Z	cemc	tommi^	what grant command did u use ?
2005-09-03T12:16:00.000Z	tommi^	cemc	mysqlnavigator's grant system
2005-09-03T12:17:00.000Z	cemc	tommi^	hm, i don't know that...
2005-09-03T12:17:00.000Z	tommi^	cemc	I think added permission for both mysql and to a db
2005-09-03T12:17:00.000Z	cemc	tommi^	do you have root password ?
2005-09-03T12:18:00.000Z	cemc	tommi^	for mysql, i mean
2005-09-03T12:18:00.000Z	tommi^	cemc	yes, I'm the administator.
2005-09-03T12:18:00.000Z	cemc	tommi^	of course you do... stupid question..
2005-09-03T12:18:00.000Z	cemc	tommi^	with that admin tool,
2005-09-03T12:19:00.000Z	tommi^	cemc	the correct one. Hostname was %
2005-09-03T12:20:00.000Z	cemc	tommi^	uhum... and i guess you type in the password right ?
2005-09-03T12:20:00.000Z	tommi^	cemc	that's for sure. I'll try now removing and adding the user again.
2005-09-03T12:22:00.000Z	cemc	tommi^	try adding localhost as the hostname
2005-09-03T12:23:00.000Z	tommi^	cemc	I think the user information table is somehow screwed. mysql_fix_privilege_tables gives me that kind of idea. Well, I'll poke around it little bit and see what I can come up with. Thanks for your help, I'll get back later..
2005-09-03T12:23:00.000Z	cemc	tommi^	i know that % = everything
