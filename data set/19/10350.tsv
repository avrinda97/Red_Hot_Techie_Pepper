2006-09-28T16:24:00.000Z	Asc		My main drive seems to be assigned to I/O address 0x3F7-0x3F7.  Is there a way to change the I/O address (or better yet make it a range, because 0x3F7 is already in use)?
2006-09-28T16:24:00.000Z	sethk	Asc	that should be handled automatically during PCI bus negotiation.  unless you have ancient hardware
2006-09-28T16:25:00.000Z	Asc	sethk	If it's being handled automatically, it's being handled automatically wrong
2006-09-28T16:27:00.000Z	sethk	Asc	you are talking about what kind of drive interface?  IDE?  SATA?
2006-09-28T16:27:00.000Z	Asc	sethk	IDE
2006-09-28T16:27:00.000Z	sethk	Asc	make sure there are no "hardwired" resource assignments in the BIOS.
2006-09-28T16:28:00.000Z	Asc	sethk	My BIOS has no such options.
2006-09-28T16:28:00.000Z	sethk	Asc	most do, but not all.
2006-09-28T16:29:00.000Z	Asc	sethk	It only happens with kernel 2.6.18; windows and 2.6.15-23 are fine.
2006-09-28T16:30:00.000Z	sethk	Asc	that's odd.  it does rule out the bios.  :)
2006-09-28T16:32:00.000Z	Asc	sethk	I'm recompiling 2.6.18 right now with the same I/O scheduler as the 2.6.15-23 kernel.  If it's not that.....
2006-09-28T16:32:00.000Z	sethk	Asc	I can't imagine the scheduler having an impact on IO port assignments, but we'll see.
2006-09-28T16:32:00.000Z	sethk	Asc	I can't imagine anything else that makes sense either.
2006-09-28T16:33:00.000Z	Asc	sethk	Heh, yeah.  Think the architecture it was compiled for would affect anything? :\
2006-09-28T16:34:00.000Z	sethk	Asc	it's not impossible.
2006-09-28T16:34:00.000Z	Asc	sethk	I've been making mine for P4 coppermine... I guess if this doesn't work I'll try again with 386
2006-11-24T15:59:00.000Z	sethk	Asc	I've never seen a structural dump of FAT
2006-11-24T15:59:00.000Z	sethk	Asc	it might be possible.  it's a windows file system, so it's perfectly possible that it's possible to dump it, and I don't know about it.
2006-11-24T16:01:00.000Z	Asc	sethk	I'll look into that.
