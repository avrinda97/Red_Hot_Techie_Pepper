2007-10-11T13:06:00.000Z	foug	IndyGunFreak	i had to reinstall debian twice after i incorrectly set up my 3d drivers ;\

2007-10-11T13:06:00.000Z	foug	IndyGunFreak	what distro were you using to learn on?
2007-10-11T13:07:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	foug	i mostly learned Xandros, then just didn't like it, tried Fedora, used it for about 6mo, then someone turned me on To Kubuntu, which I hated, then I found Ubuntu, and it was love at first site.
2007-10-11T13:07:00.000Z	foug	IndyGunFreak	using debian atm, not liking it as much i tohguht I would. thinking of trying out Fedora or SUSE on an older comp
2007-10-11T13:08:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	foug	well, my personal opinion, having used both of them, Ubuntu kills Fedora/Suse
2007-10-11T13:08:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	foug	Debian/Ubuntu has a far superior package manager, IMO
2007-10-11T13:09:00.000Z	foug	IndyGunFreak	i wouldn't doubt it, but i'd like to get some better linux knowledge on my plate
2007-10-11T13:09:00.000Z	foug	IndyGunFreak	ya, apt-get is amazing, that's why i tried debian.
2007-10-11T13:09:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	foug	then install slackware..lol
