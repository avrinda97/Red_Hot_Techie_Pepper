2008-08-11T14:52:00.000Z	prince_jammys	neeto	it could be related to the .Xauthority or .ICEauthority files in your home dir, if i recall right
2008-08-11T14:55:00.000Z	prince_jammys	neeto	make sure your user owns both files. On mine, the permissions are rw------- for both
2008-08-11T14:55:00.000Z	neeto	prince_jammys	which files now?
2008-08-11T14:58:00.000Z	prince_jammys	neeto	.Xauthority and .ICEauthority (i think it's the latter). you can even try temporarily renaming .ICEauthority
2008-08-11T15:00:00.000Z	prince_jammys	neeto	did you change the permissions of your home directory at all?
2008-08-11T15:01:00.000Z	neeto	prince_jammys	no, I don't know what happened to this computer, I had seriously just left it in my backpack... it's my school computer, so I hadn't used it really since spring term got over
2008-08-11T15:02:00.000Z	prince_jammys	neeto	what does the following give: ls -ld .Xauthority .ICEauthority ~
2008-08-11T15:02:00.000Z	neeto	prince_jammys	that's what's weird, I can't chmod or ls .Xauthority, but somehow locate still finds it
2008-08-11T15:02:00.000Z	prince_jammys	neeto	ls -ld ~/.Xauthority ~/.ICEauthority ~
2008-08-11T15:04:00.000Z	neeto	prince_jammys	both are -rw------
2008-08-11T15:05:00.000Z	prince_jammys	neeto	owned by your user, right? what about your home dir? ls -ld ~
2008-08-11T15:06:00.000Z	neeto	prince_jammys	all owned by me
2008-08-11T15:06:00.000Z	prince_jammys	neeto	ok, well that eliminates that. those sometimes cause the error you said
2008-08-11T15:07:00.000Z	neeto	prince_jammys	I see, well no worries. I think I am just going to reformat it. It's still running 7.10 anyway, time for an upgrade.
2008-08-11T15:07:00.000Z	prince_jammys	neeto	you can try renaming .ICEauthority to something else, and log back in
2008-08-11T15:08:00.000Z	prince_jammys	neeto	apparently this has worked for some people. if it doesn't, you rename it back.
2008-08-11T15:08:00.000Z	neeto	prince_jammys	sounds strange... I'll try it
2008-08-11T15:09:00.000Z	prince_jammys	neeto	if for whatever reason you can't log in, ctrl-alt-F1 from the login screen an rename .ICEauthority back from the terminal.
2008-08-11T15:10:00.000Z	neeto	prince_jammys	got it
