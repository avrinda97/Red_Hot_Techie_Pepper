2007-02-19T17:26:00.000Z	Icehawk78		lol, okay, just checking.
2007-02-19T10:54:00.000Z	Icehawk78		Can someone point me in the direction of where I need to go to enable DynDNS to upadte my IP on my server?
2007-02-19T10:56:00.000Z	Icehawk78		!dyndns | me
2007-02-19T10:57:00.000Z	Icehawk78		krontab: It wants me to explicitly select a specific one to install
2007-02-19T10:57:00.000Z	Icehawk78		Package dyndns-client is a virtual package provided by:
2007-02-19T10:57:00.000Z	Icehawk78		  ez-ipupdate 3.0.11b8-10ubuntu1
2007-02-19T10:57:00.000Z	Icehawk78		  ddclient 3.6.7-2ubuntu3
2007-02-19T10:57:00.000Z	Icehawk78		You should explicitly select one to install.
2007-02-19T10:57:00.000Z	Icehawk78		E: Package dyndns-client has no installation candidate
2007-02-19T10:58:00.000Z	macd	Icehawk78	ez-ipupdate is the GUI-fied version.
2007-02-19T10:59:00.000Z	macd	Icehawk78	 then you'll do your config in /etc/ddclient/ddclient.conf
2007-02-19T11:00:00.000Z	Icehawk78	macd	Actually, one other question (for now)... What is the "interface used" for the Dynamic DNS service?
2007-02-19T11:01:00.000Z	macd	Icehawk78	as in eth0, etc.
2007-02-19T11:02:00.000Z	macd	Icehawk78	if your using NAT or something make sure to include use=web in your config.
2007-02-19T11:03:00.000Z	Icehawk78	macd	I currently have use=if, if=eth0
2007-02-19T11:03:00.000Z	macd	Icehawk78	that will set your dyndns info to eth0's IP, you want use=web
2007-02-19T11:04:00.000Z	Icehawk78	macd	Do I need to restart the ddclient process now?
2007-02-19T11:05:00.000Z	macd	Icehawk78	I would issue "sudo /etc/init.d/ddclient restart"
2007-02-19T11:05:00.000Z	macd	Icehawk78	the beauty of a large user based community ;P
