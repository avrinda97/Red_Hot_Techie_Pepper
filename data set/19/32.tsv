2012-11-29T12:30:00.000Z	Ozimag	kingbeast	I'm making a script and need to match *Chrome*NAME_OF_FLASH_LIB*
2012-11-29T12:30:00.000Z	Ozimag	kingbeast	with regexp, but I don't have an Ubuntu machine available
2012-11-29T12:32:00.000Z	Ozimag	kingbeast	I need the output when Chrome is running with a flash been shown
2012-11-29T12:33:00.000Z	Ozimag	kingbeast	you can try youtube or justin.tv
2012-11-29T12:33:00.000Z	Ozimag	kingbeast	be sure not to have html5 vids on if on youtube
2012-11-29T12:40:00.000Z	kingbeast	Ozimag	JmanGuy  did the pastebin do it for you?
2012-11-29T12:42:00.000Z	Ozimag	kingbeast	you only posted one don't you? The one I saw from you didn't mention any flash plugin, were you watching any flash vid when running ps?

2012-11-29T12:46:00.000Z	Ozimag	kingbeast	still no flash plugin, maybe you have html5 vids on youtube if that's what you visited? Or maybe chrome on some cases doesn't show an argument with the flash plugin in use.
2012-11-29T12:46:00.000Z	Ozimag	kingbeast	would you mind going to justin.tv , see any channel, and post "ps aux | grep flash"?
2012-11-29T12:47:00.000Z	kingbeast	Ozimag	 it's set how you requested, and that was the output.

2012-11-29T12:52:00.000Z	Ozimag	kingbeast	thank you, same output as before but I needed this time, as said, "ps aux | grep flash". But I won't bother you anymore you have done too much thanks :)

2012-11-29T12:56:00.000Z	Ozimag	kingbeast	thanks again. Seems Chrome don't shows flash plugin in your case. I will have to consider that on my script.
