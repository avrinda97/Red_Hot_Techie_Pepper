2006-06-17T14:10:00.000Z	Madpilot	blacktears	there are apps in Ubuntu's repos that do that - what sort of monitoring?
2006-06-17T14:12:00.000Z	Madpilot	blacktears	the easiest way to install stuff is from repos - if you clarify what you want, someone here can help you find an app that's easier to install...
2006-06-17T14:14:00.000Z	Madpilot	blacktears	go System->Administration->Synaptic Package Manager, use the search button to look for network monitoring - there's lots of apps
2006-06-18T08:08:00.000Z	Madpilot	blacktears	cedega isn't a game, it's a payware emulator for Windows games in Linux
2006-06-18T08:08:00.000Z	Madpilot	blacktears	for good free games - what style of games to you like?
2006-06-18T08:09:00.000Z	Madpilot	blacktears	have a look at Battle of Wesnoth - it's in Ubuntu's repos, it's a turn-based strategy game
2006-06-18T08:10:00.000Z	Madpilot	blacktears	no, wesnoth is more like Heroes of Might & Magic, if you've ever played that
2006-06-18T08:10:00.000Z	Madpilot	blacktears	open Synaptic, search for 'game' or 'games', have a look at what comes up
2006-06-18T08:13:00.000Z	Madpilot	blacktears	hadn't actually heard of it - just checking the website now
2006-06-18T08:13:00.000Z	Madpilot	blacktears	wesnoth has better graphics, no idea about gameplay
2006-06-18T08:15:00.000Z	Madpilot	blacktears	just install all the wesnoth packages
2006-06-18T08:17:00.000Z	Madpilot	blacktears	no, wesnoth is medieval/fantasy
