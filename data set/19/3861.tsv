2009-05-14T00:34:00.000Z	Piet	MUHO987	the traffic you have captured there is both arp traffic, which is fundamental network traffic required to make tcp/ip based protocols work correctly, and a DNS request.
2009-05-14T00:35:00.000Z	MUHO987	Piet	! So wont I never see my network in zero ?
2009-05-14T00:36:00.000Z	MUHO987		There are people in forums whose internet is now using like me...
2009-05-14T00:36:00.000Z	Piet	MUHO987	the DNS request is your computer asking your providers' name server for its own reverse mapping, i think
2009-05-14T00:36:00.000Z	Piet	MUHO987	if you don't want network traffic then disable your network interfaces.
2009-05-14T00:37:00.000Z	MUHO987		What you mean with "interface " ??
2009-05-14T00:37:00.000Z	Piet	MUHO987	or use a firewall if you want to allow certain requests specifically.
2009-05-14T00:37:00.000Z	Piet	MUHO987	by "interface", i mean the network interface card's representation in software.
