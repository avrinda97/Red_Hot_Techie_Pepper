2011-05-02T13:48:00.000Z	ojii		how do I move a window to another workspace in unity? In 10.10 I'd just right-click->move to workspace X
2011-05-02T13:50:00.000Z	usalabs	ojii	right click the app title bar
2011-05-02T13:50:00.000Z	ojii	usalabs	right click does nothing there
2011-05-02T13:51:00.000Z	usalabs		mmm, I just tried it on Xchat title bar, and I have a selection of move to another workspace, and has a choice of 2,3,4
2011-05-02T13:53:00.000Z	usalabs	ojii	if the app is full screen, then click the 3rd icon on the left of the title bar to come off full screen, then you should be able to right click the apps title bar
2011-05-02T13:55:00.000Z	ojii	usalabs	wow that's *really* intuitive :(
2011-05-02T13:56:00.000Z	usalabs	ojii	on the left of the title bar you have a red x, a minus and a squarre,,, click the square to come out of full screen
2011-05-02T13:57:00.000Z	ojii	usalabs	I know how to get out of full screen mode (I prefer double-rightclick), I just find it really odd that I have to do that to move it to another workspace, ideally I'd be able to drag it but maybe that's asking too much
2011-05-02T13:59:00.000Z	usalabs	ojii	I just tried the drag method it works, but only if the app is windowed
2011-05-02T13:59:00.000Z	ojii	usalabs	didn't for me :(
2011-05-02T14:00:00.000Z	ojii		guess I'll just stick to single-workspace mode
2011-05-02T14:00:00.000Z	ojii		also, is there any hack out yet to move the damn 'unitybar'? I have a 4 screen setup + synergy. now the bar is in the middle of my screens and hard to 'activate'
2011-05-02T14:02:00.000Z	usalabs	ojii	click on the workspace switcher, then drag the windowed app across to a workspace,, it works for me that way too
2011-05-02T14:03:00.000Z	ojii		ah thanks usalabs, still seems a bit too hard for such a trivial task, but that's nicer
2011-05-02T14:03:00.000Z	usalabs		glad I could help
2011-05-02T14:07:00.000Z	usalabs	ojii	you can also use the same method for full screen apps too
2011-05-02T14:07:00.000Z	ojii		oh nice
2011-05-02T14:07:00.000Z	ojii	usalabs	thanks a lot, that's how i want it ;-)
2011-05-02T14:08:00.000Z	usalabs	ojii	yw
