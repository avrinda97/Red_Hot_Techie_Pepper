2007-01-19T11:42:00.000Z	ro_		All people around here NEVER have a problem with Tcl/Tk fonts appearance ????
2007-01-19T11:43:00.000Z	Tonren	ro_	This is a total off-the-cuff suggestion, but try running "sudo dpkg-reconfigure fontconfig" or fontconfig-config.
2007-01-19T11:43:00.000Z	Tonren	ro_	I had shitty terminal fonts until I ran that and selected "enable Bitmap fonts"
2007-01-19T11:45:00.000Z	ro_	Tonren	I use xubuntu 6.10
2007-01-19T11:46:00.000Z	Tonren	ro_	I used Xfce for a while but I didn't like its file manager, and it was missing a few other things too
2007-01-19T11:46:00.000Z	ro_	Tonren	Now it have Thunar as default, many better
2007-01-19T11:48:00.000Z	ro_	Tonren	I really prefer gnome and kde over xfce, but this is not my home machine
2007-01-19T11:48:00.000Z	Tonren	ro_	I might try Xfce again some day.  Right now I'm rocking out on KDE.
2007-01-19T11:52:00.000Z	Tonren	ro_	Is English your second language?  There are other chatrooms for several languages, you know.
2007-01-19T11:52:00.000Z	Tonren	ro_	sorry to be blunt.
2007-01-19T11:52:00.000Z	Tonren	ro_	If you want to send someone a private message, type: "/msg username message message message"
2007-01-19T11:58:00.000Z	Tonren	ro_	Most of the time, yes.
2007-01-19T12:00:00.000Z	Tonren	ro_	Most people come here for Questions & Answers, so you can just ask your question and wait for someone to type your name in a response, or keep a lookout for questions you know how to answer.
2007-01-19T12:08:00.000Z	ro_	Tonren	I had enabled bitmapped fonts, and don't help
2007-01-19T12:08:00.000Z	Tonren	ro_	Sorry man... that was my only idea.
2007-01-19T12:09:00.000Z	ro_	Tonren	What i want to do is change the fonts like I do in gtk, or mess with some kind of xresource
2007-01-19T12:09:00.000Z	Tonren	ro_	You know as well as I do.  I don't know anything about fonts, really.
2007-01-19T12:09:00.000Z	ro_	Tonren	But thanks for intention
2007-01-19T12:11:00.000Z	ro_	Tonren	I will try in another places, and wait more time here seeing the posts, its very good to may help in something
