2009-02-20T08:40:00.000Z	anteaya		are there known issues with ibex and firefox? trying to help a friend who just downloaded a bunch of system upgrades and now firefox is running very slow though not using a lot of memory. Suggestions?
2009-02-20T08:41:00.000Z	anteaya		I have searched for ibex and firefox but there is no definitive issue or solution posted
2009-02-20T08:41:00.000Z	ldiamond	anteaya	there are issues yes, some are with Flash tho.
2009-02-20T08:41:00.000Z	ldiamond	anteaya	you might want to use Firefox's binaries instead of the Ubuntu package
2009-02-20T08:41:00.000Z	anteaya	ldiamond	what is the issue with Flash?
2009-02-20T08:41:00.000Z	ldiamond	anteaya	check the CPU usage of Firefox too
2009-02-20T08:42:00.000Z	ldiamond	anteaya	Made firefox crash and high CPU usage
2009-02-20T08:42:00.000Z	ldiamond	anteaya	the newest binaries from Adobe should solve it
2009-02-20T08:44:00.000Z	anteaya	ldiamond	Scunizi thanks guys, transmitted the rename suggestion and will go from there
2009-02-20T08:44:00.000Z	anteaya	ldiamond	so the flash suggestion is to uninstall flash as an ubunut package and reinstall flash as a binary package from adobe?
2009-02-20T08:45:00.000Z	ldiamond	anteaya	you could do it that way. The flash plugin is located in ~/.mozilla/plugins
2009-02-20T08:46:00.000Z	anteaya	ldiamond	thanks I will see how the first suggestion goes and then go for that one
2009-02-20T08:46:00.000Z	ldiamond	anteaya	its called libflashplayer.so. Replacing this file with the Adobe's binaries will work just fine
2009-02-20T08:46:00.000Z	anteaya	ldiamond	thanks so much, I will consider that my next suggestion
2009-02-20T08:47:00.000Z	ldiamond	anteaya	flash is only the problem is the issue occurs on flash sites.
2009-02-20T08:47:00.000Z	ldiamond	anteaya	otherwise, the Firefox binaries might be the problem
2009-02-20T08:47:00.000Z	ldiamond	anteaya	you can download these binaries directly from firefox.com
2009-02-20T08:48:00.000Z	anteaya	ldiamond	thanks I am taking notes
2009-02-20T08:59:00.000Z	anteaya	ldiamond	Scunizi thanks guys the renaming of ~/.mozilla to ~/.mozilla_backup and the restart seemed to have solved the problem for now, and I told him about the suggestion to download the flash binary from adobe, cheers guys
