2008-01-08T23:43:00.000Z	DRebellion		is floodbot an ubuntu maintained bot? or part of freenode? or not?
2008-01-08T23:44:00.000Z	DRebellion		!floodbot | DRebellion
2008-01-08T23:44:00.000Z	LjL	DRebellion	don't be concerned about it.
2008-01-08T23:45:00.000Z	DRebellion	LjL	ignorance == m$ == bad
2008-01-08T23:46:00.000Z	LjL	DRebellion	the people who need to know, know.
2008-01-08T23:47:00.000Z	DRebellion	LjL	i thought ubunutu practiced open values eg. open information?
2008-01-08T23:48:00.000Z	DRebellion	LjL	right...
2008-01-18T21:47:00.000Z	LjL	DRebellion	please give that factoid in PM, since it's so spammy
2008-01-18T21:47:00.000Z	DRebellion	LjL	hmm. its just that some people get pretty annoyed when you send them a pm
2008-01-18T21:48:00.000Z	LjL	DRebellion	that is completely their problem. if they don't want to be helped, they shouldn't be in here.
2008-01-18T21:48:00.000Z	DRebellion	LjL	ok fair enough
2008-01-18T23:15:00.000Z	LjL	DRebellion	aptitude is not a front-end for apt-get, it never uses apt-get
2008-01-19T03:52:00.000Z	DRebellion	LjL	wow, that's pretty cool. How is it used in a system context?
2008-01-19T03:53:00.000Z	LjL	DRebellion	see you too the above, perhaps it answers it?
2008-01-19T03:54:00.000Z	DRebellion	LjL	so when an application wants the user to edit a file it will use the command editor?
2008-01-19T03:55:00.000Z	LjL	DRebellion	yes, at least that's the concept. an instance where it is used massively is "java"
2008-01-19T03:55:00.000Z	DRebellion	LjL	i like it :P
2008-01-19T04:08:00.000Z	DRebellion	LjL	i believe floodbot1 already gave the pastebin link
2008-01-19T04:08:00.000Z	LjL	DRebellion	yes it did, i'm sorry.
