2008-04-02T11:25:00.000Z	Colypso		im ssh root
2008-04-02T11:25:00.000Z	Colypso		ssh root
2008-04-02T11:27:00.000Z	Colypso		i dont know
2008-04-02T11:27:00.000Z	Colypso		remote
2008-04-02T11:28:00.000Z	nikrud	Colypso	did you create a new user on the remote, and log into that new user?
2008-04-02T11:29:00.000Z	nikrud	Colypso	ah, as root:   adduser ssh admin
2008-04-02T11:40:00.000Z	nikrud	Colypso	what irc client are you using?
2008-04-02T11:32:00.000Z	nikrud	Colypso	when you create a new user, it's not automatically given sudo privileges. You have to assign them by adding them to the admin group.   hence,     adduser ssh admin   to give your ssh user admin privs
2008-04-02T11:33:00.000Z	nikrud	Colypso	then, get back out of root on the remote and  try ssh'ing in
2008-04-02T11:35:00.000Z	nikrud	Colypso	to be clear: you have root on the remote, right? And that's the place you want ssh to have sudo privs?
2008-04-02T11:36:00.000Z	nikrud	Colypso	ok, and you want the user   ssh    on the remote to be able to sudo ?
2008-04-02T11:37:00.000Z	nikrud	Colypso	ok, in root in putty, type:       adduser  ssh admin  .  After you do that,  anyone logging in as ssh will be able to use sudo
2008-04-02T11:37:00.000Z	nikrud	Colypso	then, what user on the remote do you want to have sudo privileges?
2008-04-02T11:38:00.000Z	nikrud	Colypso	   you said you'd added the user  ssh , we had a communication problem.    sudo adduer colypso admin
2008-04-02T11:39:00.000Z	nikrud	Colypso	typo:    adduser colypso admin
2008-04-02T11:39:00.000Z	nikrud	Colypso	now, try ssh'ing in as colypso
2008-04-02T11:41:00.000Z	nikrud	Colypso	doesn't it colorize when someone types your name in a line?
2008-04-02T11:42:00.000Z	nikrud	Colypso	in fact, the only reason I was able to keep up with you was I kept my eyes on the screen all the time.  If you had typed, for example    nikrud nope  , that line would be red in xchat
2008-04-02T11:43:00.000Z	nikrud	Colypso	is always welcome :)
