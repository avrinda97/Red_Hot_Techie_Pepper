2010-07-20T17:53:00.000Z	ocs		hi. I have two monitors and two respective X sessions. In addition, I have a ssh server listening. How can I connect, from a remote host, to the desktop of the X session 2 ?
2010-07-20T17:53:00.000Z	thewanderer1	ocs	you connect and set DISPLAY accordingly
2010-07-20T17:54:00.000Z	ocs	thewanderer1	yes
2010-07-20T17:54:00.000Z	ocs	thewanderer1	I know, but how can I do?
2010-07-20T17:55:00.000Z	ocs	thewanderer1	that's not may aim
2010-07-20T17:55:00.000Z	thewanderer1	ocs	so if you want to run a program on a remote desktop only, set DISPLAY properly
2010-07-20T17:55:00.000Z	ocs	thewanderer1	ok, but in which way?
2010-07-20T17:56:00.000Z	thewanderer1	ocs	you should also remember that you won't be able to invade someone else's session in terms of users
2010-07-20T17:57:00.000Z	ocs	thewanderer1	again, I already know that
2010-07-20T17:57:00.000Z	ocs	thewanderer1	on kde I launched kdesktop
2010-07-20T17:58:00.000Z	ocs	thewanderer1	sorry. gnome
2010-07-20T17:58:00.000Z	thewanderer1	ocs	then you have to init it like GDM does
2010-07-20T17:59:00.000Z	ocs	thewanderer1	I'm sure there's a faster way. on kde I simply launched kdesktop
2010-07-20T17:59:00.000Z	thewanderer1	ocs	preferably yes, although I believe you should have run startkde
2010-07-20T18:00:00.000Z	thewanderer1	ocs	but I don't see a friendly script on GNOME... I don't like GNOME anyway :P
2010-07-20T18:01:00.000Z	thewanderer1	ocs	try gnome-session
2010-07-20T18:02:00.000Z	ocs	thewanderer1	so, what could be the way to start gnome from a remote host ?
2010-07-20T18:02:00.000Z	thewanderer1	ocs	export DISPLAY=:1.0; gnome-session;
2010-07-20T18:04:00.000Z	ocs	thewanderer1	great. thanks for all
