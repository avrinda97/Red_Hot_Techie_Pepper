2011-07-07T17:15:00.000Z	chipmonk		i wish i could persuade my two ubuntu 10.10s to share files
2011-07-07T17:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chipmonk	could use samba or sshfs easily
2011-07-07T17:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chipmonk	how did you  configure samba?
2011-07-07T17:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chipmonk	not stupid, just inexperienced
2011-07-07T17:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chipmonk	then run:  sudo smbpasswd -a $USER     set the password and you can authenticate as the user
2011-07-07T17:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chipmonk	you shouldn't be running stull like that as root, you should be using YOUR user
2011-07-07T17:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chipmonk	then samba users can authenticate as your user and get access
2011-07-07T17:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chipmonk	nop, use:   sudo smbpsswd -a eman
2011-07-07T17:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chipmonk	it's a username, not a computer name
2011-07-07T17:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chipmonk	if you quit messing with the root account and used sudo like normal, you would have fewer issues as the advise given here assume (and rightly so) that you do not. You are making it all harder for yourself
2011-07-07T17:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chipmonk	$ is the user prompt
2011-07-07T17:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chipmonk	I never said to run that. I said:    sudo smbpasswd -a $USER    if you change the commands given, you will get issues
2011-07-07T17:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chipmonk	No, type the command EXACTLY as I gave it. I give the exact command so you can copy and paste it
2011-07-07T17:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chipmonk	sudo smbpasswd -a $USER
2011-07-07T17:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chipmonk	what is the output of:   lsb_release -d
2011-08-29T09:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chipmonk	you could cron a job to scan the directory, then have a bash script to print the docs found
2011-08-29T09:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chipmonk	yes, cron
2011-08-29T09:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chipmonk	good :)
2011-08-29T09:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chipmonk	you'll have a script to do the task once, then use cron to make it happen as frequently as you like
