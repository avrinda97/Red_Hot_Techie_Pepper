2004-10-29T16:19:00.000Z	dyn		does ubuntu installs clean out of the box to a sata hda?
2004-10-29T16:19:00.000Z	Ng	dyn	should do
2004-10-29T16:19:00.000Z	Ng	dyn	I installed it to an SATA drive on a via controller
2004-10-29T16:19:00.000Z	dyn	Ng	sounds ok.. my n00b friend would need to install on sata
2004-10-29T16:20:00.000Z	Ng	dyn	I think it should be fine unless he has an unsupported controller
2004-10-29T16:21:00.000Z	Ng	dyn	I'm sure I've come across something still using the IDE layer for SATA, but yeah, they mostly seem to use SCSI now
2004-10-29T16:22:00.000Z	dyn	Ng	just as i said, kernels around 2.6.5-2.6.7 used the /dev/hde,.. stuff
2004-10-29T16:23:00.000Z	Ng	dyn	I think it was a later kernel than that, but I only used the controller once, so it could be my faulty brain ;)
2004-10-30T16:29:00.000Z	Ng	dyn	I think that's somewhere on the wiki/faq
2004-10-30T16:29:00.000Z	Ng	dyn	I vaguely remember reading something about the cpu targets they compile for
2004-10-30T16:30:00.000Z	dyn	Ng	we really have no idea about how this can happen
2004-10-30T16:31:00.000Z	dyn	Ng	ok, you got point here :)
2004-10-30T16:32:00.000Z	Ng	dyn	from what I can see, this is built with -march=i486 -mcpu=pentium4
2004-10-30T16:33:00.000Z	Ng	dyn	http://www.ubuntulinux.org/support/documentation/faq/optimised-packages/view
2004-10-30T16:36:00.000Z	Ng	dyn	there are so many things that can affect that, it's quite hard to pin it down to gcc
2004-10-30T16:36:00.000Z	dyn	Ng	the "optimised C library" stands for a tweaked glibc compilation, or something else?
2004-10-30T16:36:00.000Z	dyn	Ng	yeah i know it's a fast moving target ;)
2004-10-30T16:36:00.000Z	dyn	Ng	i'm just looking for any hints or tips on what can cause that
2004-10-30T16:37:00.000Z	Ng	dyn	I'm not sure if ubuntu does, it was just a possibility that sprung to mind
