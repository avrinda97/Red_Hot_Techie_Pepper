2007-12-20T00:53:00.000Z	DrJohnston		Anyone here running TFTP successfully?
2007-12-20T00:54:00.000Z	DrJohnston		Can anyone give me any hints how i can troubleshoot TFTP?  I see it's listening  in netstat, but the connection always times out when trying to connect locally or otherwise
2007-12-20T00:54:00.000Z	DrJohnston		udp        0      0 *:tftp                  *:*
2007-12-20T00:55:00.000Z	DrJohnston		I need a networking or TFTP ninja
2007-12-20T00:55:00.000Z	ae88925	DrJohnston	Check your iptables rules
2007-12-20T00:55:00.000Z	DrJohnston		how do i do that?
2007-12-20T00:56:00.000Z	ae88925		this will list the rules: sudo iptables -nvL       but it will not teach you how to read them
2007-12-20T00:57:00.000Z	ae88925		Pidgin 2.2.1
2007-12-20T00:58:00.000Z	ae88925		on gutsy
2007-12-20T00:58:00.000Z	DrJohnston	ae88925	- it looks like my iptables are 'empty'
2007-12-20T01:05:00.000Z	DrJohnston		How can i figure out why TFTP connections are working if the service is running, there are no iptables rules?
2007-12-20T01:05:00.000Z	DrJohnston		This is driving me nuts.....
2007-12-20T01:05:00.000Z	DrJohnston		The connection just times out
2007-12-20T01:06:00.000Z	DrJohnston		My hosts.allow / hosts.deny are setup to allow all
2007-12-20T01:06:00.000Z	DrJohnston		So i'm not sure why it's being blocked if the service is running and showing in netstat as well
2007-12-20T01:07:00.000Z	ae88925	DrJohnston	it might be helpful to read the manpage for tftpd.  Some daemons have an option to run in foreground with debug messages.
2007-12-20T01:07:00.000Z	DrJohnston		Ah
2007-12-20T01:07:00.000Z	ae88925	DrJohnston	In the past (years ago) I've seen tftpd problems with directory permissions
2007-12-20T01:08:00.000Z	DrJohnston	ae88925	- The directory setup is 777
