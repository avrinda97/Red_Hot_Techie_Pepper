2010-09-18T16:23:00.000Z	Crash2108		What does it mean when your .bashrc file has a word and ()?  How are you to execute that function?
2010-09-18T16:24:00.000Z	Crash2108		It's just "extract () { ..."
2010-09-18T16:24:00.000Z	Crash2108		jrib
2010-09-18T16:25:00.000Z	Crash2108		But how do I use it?
2010-09-18T16:25:00.000Z	jrib	Crash2108	like any other bash function
2010-09-18T16:25:00.000Z	jrib	Crash2108	it's a function named "extract".  I don't understand your question.
2010-09-18T16:23:00.000Z	jrib	Crash2108	pastebin what you are talking about
2010-09-18T16:25:00.000Z	jrib	Crash2108	i.e.  extract arg1 arg2 ...
2010-09-18T16:26:00.000Z	jrib	Crash2108	your bashrc is likely not sourced when you ssh
2010-09-18T16:27:00.000Z	Crash2108	jrib	what do you mean not sourced?
2010-09-18T16:27:00.000Z	jrib	Crash2108	bash doesn't read it...
2010-09-18T16:28:00.000Z	Crash2108	jrib	how do I ensure that that funciton is always available for all methods and users?
2010-09-18T16:29:00.000Z	jrib	Crash2108	put it in a file that gets sourced system-wide.  What do you mean by "all methods"?
2010-09-18T16:31:00.000Z	Crash2108	jrib	as in, having that function available if I'm SSHing, or using GUI or PHP's method to execute system functions, etc.
2010-09-18T16:31:00.000Z	jrib	Crash2108	put it in /etc/profile or similar.  No idea what php does

2010-09-19T15:05:00.000Z	jrib	Crash2108	it's not evil.  But people often try to brute force the root account...
2010-09-19T15:06:00.000Z	jrib	Crash2108	so ask the person that told you that...?  Anyway, there's no root account by default in ubuntu and it isn't necessary either
2010-09-19T15:07:00.000Z	jrib	Crash2108	what I mean to say is the root account is locked by default
