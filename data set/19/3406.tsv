2009-12-25T19:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	haresh	 if you mean a mp3 player.  Check 'dmesg' output when you pkug it in - see if its seen as a usb 'drive' that you can access.. if thats the issue
2009-12-25T19:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	haresh	 when you first plugin the gizmo - check dmesg output about 5 sec later.. see if it mentions the device.
