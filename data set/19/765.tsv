2011-09-05T04:49:00.000Z	loverbear		So, I have about 9 hours of battery in windows... In ubuntu (live media, I know) I'm seeing not even 5. What's up? I should be able to squeeze at least 9 out of linux. :S
2011-09-05T04:50:00.000Z	notlistening	loverbear	are you using cpu throttling and display dimming?
2011-09-05T04:50:00.000Z	loverbear	notlistening	I haven't checked throttling, will look now thanks
2011-09-05T04:51:00.000Z	loverbear	notlistening	I'm more worried if ubuntu has too many "features" running
2011-09-05T04:53:00.000Z	notlistening	loverbear	which version have you installed?
2011-09-05T04:53:00.000Z	loverbear	notlistening	Scaling is on and the display is as dim as I can get it. Showing 4:45 left (90%)... Using 11.04 live flash
2011-09-05T04:54:00.000Z	loverbear	notlistening	CPU's are being scaled down to 800mhz from their usual 2.5ghz
2011-09-05T04:54:00.000Z	notlistening	loverbear	have you actually done a test to see how reliable that battery data is?
2011-09-05T04:56:00.000Z	loverbear	notlistening	I used this laptop every day for over a month with 6+ hours off power using mathematica/wifi/oneNote... Most days I'd still have at least 1:35 estimated leftover.
2011-09-05T04:56:00.000Z	notlistening	loverbear	i am getting at the point have you run it till the battery dies?
2011-09-05T04:57:00.000Z	loverbear	notlistening	In ubuntu? I haven't.
2011-09-05T04:57:00.000Z	loverbear	notlistening	In windows I got bored after the 8th hour and went to bed.
2011-09-05T05:01:00.000Z	notlistening	loverbear	try installing powertop
2011-09-05T05:05:00.000Z	notlistening	loverbear	try that app its very good
2011-09-05T05:08:00.000Z	notlistening	loverbear	actually my mouse keep going to sleep which is great for power saving but quite annoying always having to wake it up :D
2011-09-05T05:12:00.000Z	loverbear	notlistening	Congratulations. I'm thinking I'll just work on a funtoo set up since I can keep things more tidy
2011-09-05T05:21:00.000Z	notlistening	loverbear	that program i recomend actually is quite cool, it gives some great pointers as to how to save power but only makes the changes temporary to test them out
2011-09-05T05:22:00.000Z	loverbear	notlistening	Powertop? Yeah. :) I use it a lot, but this is a liveUSB so no point.
2011-09-05T05:23:00.000Z	loverbear	notlistening	I'm still looking at distros since ubuntu doesn't seem right for me. :-P
