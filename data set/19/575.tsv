2011-12-14T08:59:00.000Z	blarney		gnome shell crashed on me (11.10) and is not reloading.  i dont have a window manager or anything, but I can start programs (but not switch between them) by browsing the filesystem and double clicking the executables.  given that, how do i restart gnome-shell?
2011-12-14T09:00:00.000Z	nemo	blarney	open a terminal
2011-12-14T09:01:00.000Z	nemo	blarney	since gnome-shell was crashing on me once a minute I actually put into terminal   while((1));do gnome-shell;done
2011-12-14T09:01:00.000Z	blarney	nemo	thanks ill kill chromium and try that
2011-12-14T09:01:00.000Z	nemo	blarney	I was using fglrx FWIW
2011-12-14T09:01:00.000Z	blarney	nemo	how is XFCE?  I tried it years ago and it seemed to be horrendously outdated and nothing was integrated...
2011-12-14T09:01:00.000Z	nemo	blarney	gotten a bit better
2011-12-14T09:02:00.000Z	nemo	blarney	can't hurt to install it if you have 125MiB to burn
2011-12-14T09:03:00.000Z	nemo	blarney	BTW. another thing I hated about gnome-shell - I like translucent terminals, but junk on my desktop and in windows behind them makes it hard to read the text
2011-12-14T09:03:00.000Z	nemo	blarney	in Unity and gnome2 w/ compiz, you can enable blurring of translucent windows
2011-12-14T09:03:00.000Z	blarney	nemo	ah, thanks, the mouse travel in G3 and the number of clicks to do anything in unity is driving me up a wall.  ill see what i can do with XFCE.
2011-12-14T09:03:00.000Z	nemo	blarney	breaks up sharp lines in text behind terminal windows - as far as I can tell, this is impossible in gnome-shell
2011-12-14T09:04:00.000Z	nemo	blarney	gnome-shell was more usable w/ the mint gnome shell extensions
2011-12-14T09:04:00.000Z	nemo	blarney	you can get those from the webupd8 ppa
2011-12-14T09:04:00.000Z	blarney	nemo	yeah, i dont know why theyre in love with that, it really has to be a subtle blending to work well
2011-12-14T09:05:00.000Z	blarney	nemo	so the webupd8 ppa is alright then?  i hadnt heard of them before and i didnt want their ppa messing with stuff
2011-12-14T09:05:00.000Z	nemo	blarney	seems fine to me
2011-12-14T09:05:00.000Z	nemo	blarney	they have a gnome3 specific one - check their blog
2011-12-14T09:05:00.000Z	blarney	nemo	ah, thanks, will do
