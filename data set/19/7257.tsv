2008-01-22T08:39:00.000Z	Vadi		Can anyone recommend me any RAM management programs in Ubuntu?
2008-01-22T08:39:00.000Z	nemilar	Vadi	how do you mean?
2008-01-22T08:40:00.000Z	Vadi	nemilar	Some program to manage my ram more efficiently.. like shut down unused libraries and such. Because I find that if I close down all apps, I still won't get all the ram I'd have as if I'd reboot. And with only 512ram, running gnome+kde, everything counts
2008-01-22T08:41:00.000Z	nemilar	Vadi	I don't know that anything of that sort exists...or is necessary
2008-01-22T08:42:00.000Z	Vadi	nemilar	well, there are similar tools in windows.. I thought I wouldn't need here but it looks like I do
2008-01-22T08:42:00.000Z	nemilar	Vadi	are you hitting swap heavily?
2008-01-22T08:42:00.000Z	Vadi	nemilar	at times very
2008-01-22T08:42:00.000Z	nemilar	Vadi	if you run kde apps in gnome, for example, even if you close the kde apps, the libraries still remain open unless you kill them
2008-01-22T08:42:00.000Z	Vadi	nemilar	I can also close down all apps, and still have like 400mb of swap space in use, haha.
2008-01-22T08:42:00.000Z	nemilar	Vadi	you can use top to see which apps are using the most memory
2008-01-22T08:43:00.000Z	Vadi	nemilar	it doesn't show libraries though.
2008-02-07T07:06:00.000Z	nemilar	Vadi	does apt-get autoremove do anything for you?
2008-02-07T07:06:00.000Z	Vadi	nemilar	no, nothing
2008-02-07T07:08:00.000Z	nemilar	Vadi	some of those dependencies might be in use by other programs, or there might be some other emacs stuff on your system
2008-02-07T07:08:00.000Z	Vadi	nemilar	They aren't though, at least, they weren't before
2008-02-07T07:08:00.000Z	nemilar	Vadi	what package did you remove when you removed emacs?
2008-02-07T07:08:00.000Z	nemilar	Vadi	emacs22-bin-common or something like that might still be installed
2008-02-07T07:10:00.000Z	Vadi	nemilar	Yay, reclaimed 67mb of my space. I'd say that package needs to be looked at :|
2008-02-07T07:10:00.000Z	nemilar	Vadi	'emacs' is just a meta-package... yeah apt can be a pain like that sometimes
