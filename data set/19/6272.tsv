2008-06-18T15:45:00.000Z	db92		is it possible that installing kde would "break" some of my current apps?
2008-06-18T15:45:00.000Z	db92		good :P
2008-06-18T15:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	db92	no, you only install it next to your gnome insta;l;
2008-08-05T16:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	db92	is it a pata or sata drive?
2008-08-05T16:14:00.000Z	db92	ActionParsnip	sata iirc*
2008-08-05T16:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	db92	ok does it detect in bios?
2008-08-05T16:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	db92	ok, do you see it in sudo fdisk -l
2008-08-05T16:16:00.000Z	db92	ActionParsnip	ye its there
2008-08-05T16:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	db92	ok then you'll need to add it to /etc/fsta to make it mount
2008-08-05T16:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	db92	what filesystem does it use?
2008-08-05T16:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	db92	cool
2008-08-05T16:17:00.000Z	db92	ActionParsnip	ntfs
2008-08-05T16:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	db92	maybe it was just waking up
2008-08-05T16:18:00.000Z	db92	ActionParsnip	doesnt look like it
2008-08-05T16:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	db92	then check ntfs-3g if you want it writable
2008-08-05T16:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	db92	hmm, did you md5 check your cd?
2008-08-05T16:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	db92	id check the disk just as a precaution
2008-08-05T16:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	db92	no idea in synaptic, id use sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
2008-08-06T14:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	db92	you could --reinstall install the kernel
