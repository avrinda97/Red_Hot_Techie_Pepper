2009-02-08T07:40:00.000Z	l7		hi, i just installed the openssh server but i can't get a command prompt when i shell in to my box.  do i need to configure it to use a different login shell?
2009-02-08T07:41:00.000Z	terr_	l7	openssh server?
2009-02-08T07:41:00.000Z	l7	terr_	yes
2009-02-08T07:42:00.000Z	l7	terr_	i have openssh-client and openssh-server installed
2009-02-08T07:43:00.000Z	terr_	l7	its been a few years since I worked with that
2009-02-08T07:43:00.000Z	terr_	l7	 if you remind me what they do it might ring a bell.
2009-02-08T07:44:00.000Z	l7	terr_	openssh-server allows you to connect to your box via ssh and and adminster it remotely
2009-02-08T07:45:00.000Z	terr_	l7	start the server daemon... you will need to config the user log in and any shell will owrk.  On the remote machine just ssh blah
2009-02-08T07:47:00.000Z	l7	terr_	how do i start the server daemon?  i can already ssh to localhost, so perhaps this means it is running but not properly configured.
2009-02-08T07:48:00.000Z	terr_	l7	to start the deamon try sshd
2009-02-08T07:49:00.000Z	l7	terr_	it says "sshd re-exec requires execution with an absolute path"
2009-02-08T07:50:00.000Z	terr_	l7	hmm... I've never seen that... try /locate sshd and then /usr/local or wherever it lives
2009-02-08T07:50:00.000Z	l7	terr_	actually /usr/sbin/sshd is already running when i do ps
2009-02-08T07:50:00.000Z	terr_	l7	ok - then the issue is in /etc/sshd
2009-02-08T07:50:00.000Z	terr_	l7	ok - then the issue is in /etc/sshd.config or whatiever its called.  I can check mine
2009-02-08T07:51:00.000Z	l7	terr_	the thing is i can login to my box, but i cannot get a shell
2009-02-08T07:52:00.000Z	l7	terr_	it seems to me that it does not know it needs to give me a bash shell when i log in
2009-02-08T07:52:00.000Z	terr_	l7	what is in the /etc/passwd file?
2009-02-08T07:53:00.000Z	terr_	l7	mine seems ot be 100% defaults
