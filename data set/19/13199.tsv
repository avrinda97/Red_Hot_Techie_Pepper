2005-05-10T16:57:00.000Z	transgress		okay i'm trying to play dvd's on my linux box...
2005-05-10T16:57:00.000Z	transgress		but it refuses
2005-05-10T16:57:00.000Z	indigirl1	transgress	you need libdvdcss
2005-05-10T16:57:00.000Z	transgress	indigirl1	i have it
2005-05-10T16:58:00.000Z	indigirl1	transgress	use gstreamer instead of xine
2005-05-10T16:59:00.000Z	transgress	indigirl1	tried that... totem won't even open.
2005-05-10T16:59:00.000Z	transgress	indigirl1	says the resource is busy
2005-05-10T16:59:00.000Z	indigirl1	transgress	kill any crashed instances first
2005-05-10T16:59:00.000Z	transgress	indigirl1	tried... there weren't any showing up.
2005-05-10T05:00:00.000Z	indigirl1	transgress	close all other audio programs
2005-05-10T05:00:00.000Z	indigirl1	transgress	hopefully sound works in other things
2005-05-10T05:00:00.000Z	transgress	indigirl1	why?  not to mention i'd have to kill ubuntu sounds
2005-05-10T05:01:00.000Z	transgress	indigirl1	yes sound works for everything... but mplayer gets pissed about audio... totem gets pissed about video...
2005-05-10T05:02:00.000Z	indigirl1	transgress	radeon works in mandriva too
2005-05-10T05:02:00.000Z	transgress	indigirl1	i wouldn't use mandriva if you payed me to
2005-05-10T05:03:00.000Z	indigirl1	transgress	you can pay me
2005-05-10T05:03:00.000Z	indigirl1	transgress	and i'll use it
2005-05-10T05:10:00.000Z	indigirl1	transgress	there is a helpful guide on the ubuntu website
2005-05-10T05:10:00.000Z	transgress	indigirl1	followed it
