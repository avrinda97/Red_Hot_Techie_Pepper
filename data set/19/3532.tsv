2009-11-15T13:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jr200747	 ive never even heard of a 'deti' server. how are you trying to get a remote desktop?  vnc? or some other way?
2009-11-15T13:08:00.000Z	jr200747	Dr_Willis	in using tightvnc
2009-11-15T13:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jr200747	 many vncservers default to useing twm, which is NOT installed by default and is rather lacking window mnager. Check your  .vnc/xstartup to see what its doing. and check its logs also to see what its saying
2009-11-15T13:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jr200747	 and if using vnc over the internet you will want to 'ssh tunnle it'
2009-11-15T13:22:00.000Z	jr200747	Dr_Willis	om plz
2009-11-15T13:23:00.000Z	jr200747	Dr_Willis	pm plz
2009-11-15T13:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jr200747	 you dont launch xstartup as a command..  the vncserver RUNS that script to setup the desktop its going to use.
2009-11-15T13:24:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jr200747	 examine the contents of the file to see what its running. If its running 'twm' as its window manager. change it to some other window manager
2009-11-15T13:24:00.000Z	jr200747	Dr_Willis	you have me lost m8
2009-11-15T13:25:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jr200747	 you run vncserver -> it runs xstartup.  You need to set xstartup to launch a proper window manager
2009-11-15T13:25:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jr200747	 install somthing like icewm, and edit xstartup to launch 'icewm' instead of 'twm'
2009-11-15T13:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jr200747	 its a text file.. edit it with a text editor
2009-11-15T13:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jr200747	 its a package called 'icewm' install it like you would anything else. with the package manager system
2009-11-15T13:31:00.000Z	jr200747	Dr_Willis	im sorry im a noob
2009-11-15T13:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jr200747	You really shouldent be using vnc over a unenecrypted connection.
2009-11-15T13:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jr200747	 to admin a remote box. its best to learn the command line very well.
2009-11-15T13:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jr200747	  the default xstartup here launched the default window manager for the user  which was 'gnome' for me.  if you wanted it to launch for example icewm, you would change the last line in the xstartup file to launch icewm instead
2009-11-15T13:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jr200747	 is the remote box running 9.10 or 9.04 or what exactly?
2011-02-13T11:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jr200747	 you might want to spend some time and learn some more linux fundamentals/command line basics also if you are new to linux.
