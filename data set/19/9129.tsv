2007-01-30T12:30:00.000Z	fbc_		Need to fix update manager. I keep getting a message that is damaged, and I need to run "sudo dpkg install -f" but I've run ut several times already but it does not fix the problem.. Is there some directory I can delete to restart it?
2007-01-30T12:31:00.000Z	fbc_		What is the best way to transfer my ubuntu to another hard drive? Is there some imaging utility?
