2006-03-28T15:58:00.000Z	MrMonster		evening all
2006-03-28T15:59:00.000Z	MrMonster		:)
2006-03-28T15:59:00.000Z	MrMonster		just wondering if someone here could offme a spot of advice / help regarding an install
2006-03-28T15:59:00.000Z	MrMonster		fair enuf,
2006-03-28T16:01:00.000Z	MrMonster		kernel panics with something about disks not being in sync
2006-03-28T16:01:00.000Z	MrMonster		I believe I need the i20 drivers to support the card
2006-03-28T16:02:00.000Z	MrMonster		some sort of i20 drivers were loading as I saw them scroll past before panic time
2006-03-28T16:02:00.000Z	MrMonster		yeah, will grab 5.1 tonite and try again in the morning.
2006-03-28T16:02:00.000Z	MrMonster		I've tried the 5.1 normal install CD, as well as the ubuntu-server 5.1 cd
2006-03-28T16:03:00.000Z	MrMonster		of course the official line from asus is only redhat enterprise or suse enterprise
2006-03-28T16:05:00.000Z	Agent_bob	MrMonster	yeah every body likes "pay to play"    sad really.
2006-03-28T16:06:00.000Z	MrMonster		agent_bob, annoying isn't it :) I found a netinst image for deb that includes the needed drivers but its for AMD64, not intel :(
2006-03-28T16:06:00.000Z	Agent_bob		;/
2006-03-28T16:08:00.000Z	MrMonster		any other ideas for installing on hardware RAID 5? I'm grabbing the latest dapper to see if that helps
2006-03-28T16:09:00.000Z	Agent_bob		oooh dapper is kinda unstable atm MrMonster.   if that server is critical, you may not want to run prelease on it.
2006-03-28T16:10:00.000Z	MrMonster		agent_bob, thats what I was thinking. Are there any newer install CD's that feature newer kernels than whats on the 510 release?
2006-03-28T16:10:00.000Z	Agent_bob		errr pre-release ^
2006-03-28T16:11:00.000Z	MrMonster	fyrestrtr	well I was not wanting to run ubuntu with full interface,
2006-03-28T16:11:00.000Z	Agent_bob	MrMonster	no. sorry.   not without going  pre-release
