2006-10-02T11:00:00.000Z	britt		anybody know how to change the default resolution in xfce? I'm in a real tight spot right now and could use some help
2006-10-02T11:00:00.000Z	britt		i'm just looking for a file path

2006-10-02T11:02:00.000Z	britt	khaije1	well theres a program to change it within the session
2006-10-02T11:02:00.000Z	britt		but my screen supports 800x600
2006-10-02T11:02:00.000Z	britt		and somehow my default res is 1024x768
2006-10-02T11:02:00.000Z	britt		causes major problems when i go to login
2006-10-02T11:03:00.000Z	khaije1	britt	the command i mentioned can be used within the session...
2006-10-02T11:03:00.000Z	britt	khaije1	i need it outside of the session
2006-10-02T11:03:00.000Z	britt		liek gdm sort of mode
2006-10-02T11:04:00.000Z	britt		and plus that doesnt work for some reason anyway
2006-10-02T11:04:00.000Z	britt		i cant figure out these keys
2006-10-02T11:04:00.000Z	khaije1		oh, adjust the xorg.conf file?
2006-10-02T11:04:00.000Z	britt	khaije1	talking to me?

2006-10-02T11:07:00.000Z	khaije1	britt	does that answer your question? afaik, xfce doesn't have a resolution config built in :-/
