2011-11-13T02:12:00.000Z	guntbert	monsemannen	you are on oneiric? there is no package "rdoc"
2011-11-13T02:14:00.000Z	monsemannen	guntbert	I am on oneiric, yes. That's funny. It is available here
2011-11-13T02:15:00.000Z	guntbert	monsemannen	true, I fell for ubottu's wrong answer, let me have a look
2011-11-13T02:16:00.000Z	monsemannen	guntbert	but many of my entries in sources.list is with lucid. Not sure if that matters.
2011-11-13T02:18:00.000Z	guntbert	monsemannen	you should clean that up, then run sudo apt-get update again and then install ruby, rdoc is only a "virtual package" (whatever that means) - see http://packages.ubuntu.com/oneiric/rdoc
2011-11-13T02:19:00.000Z	monsemannen	guntbert	thanks! What do you mean by cleaning it up? :)
2011-11-13T02:20:00.000Z	guntbert	monsemannen	what entries in your sources.list contain still "natty"?
2011-11-13T02:21:00.000Z	monsemannen	guntbert	none. But a number of them contains lucid
2011-11-13T02:25:00.000Z	guntbert	monsemannen	that is probably wrong and should be corrected, please show us your sources.list in a !pastebin
2011-11-13T02:29:00.000Z	monsemannen	guntbert	here's my sources.list: http://pastebin.com/krgu0cBp
2011-11-13T02:30:00.000Z	monsemannen	guntbert	should I just change them to oneiric?
2011-11-13T02:30:00.000Z	guntbert	monsemannen	wait a moment, I want to read it
2011-11-13T02:34:00.000Z	guntbert	monsemannen	you should delete line 11  and replace every other ocurrence of lucid with natty. -- How did you upgrade?
2011-11-13T02:35:00.000Z	monsemannen	guntbert	okay! Thanks. I ran 'apt-get dist-upgrade'. Why natty instead of oneiric?
2011-11-13T02:36:00.000Z	guntbert	monsemannen	ouch! thx for asking back - "replace every other ocurrence of lucid with oneiric"  of course, as to the upgrade process, please ask ubottu about it with /msg ubottu upgrade
2011-11-13T02:38:00.000Z	guntbert	monsemannen	see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MaverickUpgrades#Network_Upgrade_for_Ubuntu_Servers_.28Recommended.29  (that is still valid)
2011-11-13T02:39:00.000Z	monsemannen	guntbert	will do! Thanks for helping. Much appreciated :>
2011-11-13T02:39:00.000Z	guntbert	monsemannen	no problem :)  .. and Good luck :-)
2011-11-13T02:40:00.000Z	monsemannen	guntbert	thanks!:)
