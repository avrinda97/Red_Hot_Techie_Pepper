2010-05-06T19:26:00.000Z	nagchampa	ActionParsnip	thanks for your complete lack of help
2010-05-06T19:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nagchampa	http://hardforum.com/showthread.php?t=1460477   seems soe users use it on linux here
2010-05-06T19:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nagchampa	?
2010-05-06T19:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nagchampa	why are you aiming your rant at me. I am not the only person to support users in here so step the hell back
2010-05-06T19:32:00.000Z	nagchampa	ActionParsnip	i wasn't ranting at anyone
2010-05-06T19:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nagchampa	care to explain yourself?
2010-05-06T19:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nagchampa	ok, well Logitec HATE linux a fair old bit and the community coders make a few drivers for some of their products. There is a user who has the same make/model device and sounds quite happy, you could post on there to get a first hand experience od someone who actually has the keyboard with ubuntu to discuss the definite functionality of the device as the dude has one. Make sense?
2010-05-06T19:38:00.000Z	nagchampa	ActionParsnip	i've run into problems with logitech keyboards in the past, might try to find if there's anyone working on it in the kernel
2010-05-06T19:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nagchampa	if its the kernel you are after info on then #kernel should help
2010-05-06T19:39:00.000Z	nagchampa	ActionParsnip	yes, i know where to find it, thank you
2010-05-06T19:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nagchampa	I'd check the HCL, Logitech are notoriously bad with Linux support
2010-05-06T19:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nagchampa	absolutely
2010-05-06T19:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nagchampa	maybe try a different search engine, different engine gives different results
2010-05-06T19:41:00.000Z	nagchampa	ActionParsnip	this i have also done
2010-05-06T19:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nagchampa	good, many see google as the only search engine which is pretty bad
2010-05-06T19:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nagchampa	you could contact logitech to ask but they'll probably tell you to jump
2010-05-06T19:42:00.000Z	nagchampa	ActionParsnip	i will send them a strongly worded letter
2010-05-06T19:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nagchampa	just ignore logitech, vote with your wallet
