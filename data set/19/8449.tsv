2007-04-29T07:21:00.000Z	robinlinth		How can I check what architecture my PC is? I know it's i686, but i have a SMP kernel installed, and i don't know why... i'm confused, and i need to run a game but it has multiple architectures.. anyone?
2007-04-29T07:21:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	robinlinth	what processor?
2007-04-29T07:22:00.000Z	robinlinth	SlimeyPete	AMD Athlon XP 2800+
2007-04-29T07:22:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	robinlinth	that's i686. Don't worry about the smp kernel - it won't break anything.
2007-04-29T07:22:00.000Z	robinlinth	SlimeyPete	but why's it in?
2007-04-29T07:22:00.000Z	robinlinth	SlimeyPete	won't i386 be faster?
2007-04-29T07:22:00.000Z	robinlinth		or i686
2007-04-29T07:22:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	robinlinth	which version of ubuntu are you running? The latest versions use smp by default.
2007-04-29T07:22:00.000Z	robinlinth	SlimeyPete	Feisty.
2007-04-29T07:23:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	robinlinth	i686 will be a bit faster than i386.
2007-04-29T07:23:00.000Z	robinlinth	SlimeyPete	Do I need SMP?
2007-04-29T07:23:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	robinlinth	you don't need it, but it won't make any difference - an smp kernel on a non-smp system will simply not use the smp features.
2007-04-29T07:23:00.000Z	robinlinth	SlimeyPete	ah, okay..
2007-04-29T07:23:00.000Z	robinlinth	SlimeyPete	but the SMP version of the game -DID- run..
2007-04-29T07:24:00.000Z	robinlinth	SlimeyPete	why did it?
2007-04-29T07:24:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	robinlinth	yeah, it will do... smp won't break anything, as I say. I'm not even sure why there's an smp version of the game - that's unusual.
2007-04-29T07:24:00.000Z	robinlinth		alright.
2007-04-29T07:25:00.000Z	robinlinth	SlimeyPete	thanks for your help. See ya :)
2007-04-29T07:25:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	robinlinth	the smp kernel is just a standard kernel with smp features enabled, but on a non-smp system it'll function exactly like a non-smp kernel.
