2008-09-19T03:18:00.000Z	Jacobbs		This blows
2008-09-19T03:18:00.000Z	Jacobbs		I only have 650meg discs lol
2008-09-19T03:19:00.000Z	Jacobbs		Can I put the ISO on a dvd?
2008-09-19T03:19:00.000Z	Jacobbs		Well, I downloaded the normal iso
2008-09-19T03:19:00.000Z	Jacobbs		BUt I don't have big enough CDs
2008-09-19T03:19:00.000Z	Jacobbs		so if a dvd works, that's cool too
2008-09-19T03:20:00.000Z	Jacobbs		Using my nVidia 8800GTS on Ubuntu is possible right?
2008-09-19T03:21:00.000Z	Jacobbs		I went to their site, they kept spitting me the XP drivers
2008-09-19T03:21:00.000Z	airtonix	Jacobbs	im using nvidia 8800gt right now
2008-09-19T03:21:00.000Z	airtonix	Jacobbs	didnt have to use envy
2008-09-19T03:21:00.000Z	airtonix	Jacobbs	guess im the lucky one
2008-09-19T03:23:00.000Z	airtonix	Jacobbs	just use the standard steps outlined in the help.ubuntu.com site..
2008-09-19T03:24:00.000Z	airtonix	Jacobbs	i could be vague, but i definitly did not install any exotic packages like envy
2008-09-19T03:25:00.000Z	airtonix	Jacobbs	you will want the nvidia-xsettings package for the similar gui control you get in windows
2008-10-11T10:28:00.000Z	airtonix	Jacobbs	i use NFS between my ubuntu desktop and my ubuntu server
2008-10-11T10:29:00.000Z	airtonix	Jacobbs	the transfer speeds i get on nfs compared to samba are about double
2008-10-11T10:29:00.000Z	airtonix	Jacobbs	no.
2008-10-11T10:29:00.000Z	Jacobbs	airtonix	I'm not all that concerned about transfer speed
2008-10-11T10:31:00.000Z	airtonix	Jacobbs	dr_Willis is right microsoft have made drivers fro nfs and ext access but i would not trust them, fairly sub-standard implementations designed to make ext and nfs look bad in terms of making admins switch to windows server
