2010-10-09T09:55:00.000Z	geohacker		 hi. I upgraded to Meerkat this morning. and the system freezes for a second or two. The CPU graph stays still. mouse pointer doesn't move. nothing happens. but it gets back to normal after 2-3 seconds. what could be wrong?
2010-10-09T09:55:00.000Z	lucent	geohacker	painful blockage
2010-10-09T09:56:00.000Z	lucent	geohacker	any dmesg errors?
2010-10-09T09:56:00.000Z	geohacker	lucent	haven't checked. let me see. 1 moment.
2010-10-09T09:57:00.000Z	geohacker	lucent	 psmouse.c: GlidePoint at isa0060/serio2/input0 lost synchronization, throwing 1 bytes away. I can see this
2010-10-09T09:57:00.000Z	lucent	geohacker	hm, let's paste to paste.ubuntu.com website, the whole content of dmesg and I will look through also ?
2010-10-09T09:58:00.000Z	geohacker	lucent	okay. 1 moment
2010-10-09T10:00:00.000Z	geohacker	lucent	here it is http://paste.ubuntu.com/509257/
2010-10-09T10:00:00.000Z	lucent	geohacker	great will look now
2010-10-09T10:01:00.000Z	geohacker	lucent	I did not remove the recommended to be removed packages. but chose to keep them.
2010-10-09T10:02:00.000Z	lucent	geohacker	what is this hesitation you notice?  only on startup or is it more frequently
2010-10-09T10:02:00.000Z	geohacker	lucent	frequent. happens now. even when i type.
2010-10-09T10:02:00.000Z	lucent	geohacker	ouch
2010-10-09T10:03:00.000Z	lucent	geohacker	did it happen when booting livecd of the same distro?
2010-10-09T10:03:00.000Z	geohacker	lucent	I upgraded from Lucid.
2010-10-09T10:03:00.000Z	lucent	geohacker	yeah, try a livecd of whichever you're running now to check for that hesitation
2010-10-09T10:04:00.000Z	geohacker	lucent	oh come on! don't tell me to re install.
2010-10-09T10:04:00.000Z	lucent	geohacker	tell ya to go to #ubuntu+1 :)
2010-10-09T10:06:00.000Z	geohacker	lucent	okay. i'm there.
