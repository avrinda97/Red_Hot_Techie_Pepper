2005-04-09T14:10:00.000Z	andrew__		hey, how do i use bittorrent? i get an error every time i try to use it
2005-04-09T14:10:00.000Z	Burgundavia	andrew__	what sort of error?
2005-04-09T14:12:00.000Z	Burgundavia	andrew__	are you warty or hoary?
2005-04-09T14:12:00.000Z	Burgundavia	andrew__	hmm
2005-04-09T14:12:00.000Z	Burgundavia	andrew__	do you have wxpython installed?
2005-04-09T14:13:00.000Z	Burgundavia	andrew__	oh
2005-04-09T14:13:00.000Z	Burgundavia	andrew__	that is interesting
2005-04-09T14:14:00.000Z	Burgundavia	andrew__	do you have universe enabled?
2005-04-09T14:16:00.000Z	andrew__	Burgundavia	i have multiverse but i don't thinki  got universe
2005-04-09T14:16:00.000Z	Burgundavia	andrew__	ok, you need universe as well. Multiverse is for legally questionable stuff
2005-04-09T14:23:00.000Z	andrew__	Burgundavia	i have universe, did a reload and i still cann't find it
2005-04-09T14:24:00.000Z	Burgundavia	andrew__	that is odd
2005-04-09T14:29:00.000Z	Burgundavia	andrew__	hoary has a bitorrent client enabled by default
2005-04-09T14:30:00.000Z	Burgundavia	andrew__	gaim
2005-04-09T14:30:00.000Z	andrew__	Burgundavia	gaim will access yahoo messanger?
2005-04-09T14:30:00.000Z	Burgundavia	andrew__	to the best of my knowledge, yes
2005-04-09T14:32:00.000Z	Burgundavia	andrew__	using all memory is not a bad thing
2005-04-09T14:32:00.000Z	Burgundavia	andrew__	letting go of it is where you need to worry
2005-04-29T08:44:00.000Z	Burgundavia	andrew__	hoary has been in upstream version freeze for quite some time
