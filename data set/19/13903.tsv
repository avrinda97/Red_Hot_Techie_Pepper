2005-03-29T07:37:00.000Z	cef		price you pay for running bleeding edge
2005-03-29T07:37:00.000Z	mdke	cef	?
2005-03-29T07:37:00.000Z	mdke	cef	what is?
2005-03-29T07:37:00.000Z	cef	mdke	editing menus vanishing
2005-03-29T07:37:00.000Z	cef	mdke	edited even
2005-03-29T07:37:00.000Z	mdke	cef	no it isn't, that is not planned for the 2.10 release
2005-03-29T07:38:00.000Z	mdke	cef	editing menus is permanently off the menu until 2.12
2005-03-29T07:38:00.000Z	cef	mdke	ahh ok.. well, that'
2005-03-29T07:38:00.000Z	cef	mdke	ahh ok.. well, that's just my opinion anyway.. based on the way it happens in other dists too
2005-03-29T07:39:00.000Z	cef	mdke	and I don't just mean in gnome, kde does it like that too
2005-03-29T07:39:00.000Z	mdke	cef	i agree that in development systems things can go wrong. But this isn't an example ;) and they were complaining about some features in gnome, rather than bugs ;)
2005-03-29T07:40:00.000Z	cef	mdke	I currently triple-boot this machine.. ubuntu, debian, XP (spit!)
2005-03-29T07:42:00.000Z	cef	mdke	had to tell ubuntu's grub to use the debian kernel images via the symlinks (/vmlinuz et al), so that kernel upgrades on debian don't require so much work, and of course removing grub from debian so it doesn't overwrite the boot setup
2005-03-29T07:42:00.000Z	cef	mdke	XP? cos of work.. debian, cos I do stuff in debian that I'm not sure ubuntu is ready for yet.. and anyway, it's good to look at how the other side works
2005-03-29T07:43:00.000Z	cef	mdke	which is why in debian I'm using primarily using KDE.. *grin*
2005-03-29T07:44:00.000Z	cef	mdke	true.. mebbe in the future.. currently, I'
2005-03-29T07:44:00.000Z	cef	mdke	true.. mebbe in the future.. currently, I'll stick with this setup
2005-03-29T07:45:00.000Z	cef	mdke	well this is on a toshiba, so I got XP Pro installed on it by default
