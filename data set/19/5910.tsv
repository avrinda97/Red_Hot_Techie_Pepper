2008-12-18T07:11:00.000Z	kajo		does anyone know how to use fdisk to mark a partition with a bootflag?
2008-12-18T07:11:00.000Z	kajo		or any other program, I'm flexible...
2008-12-18T07:12:00.000Z	fryguy	kajo	use cfdisk
2008-12-18T07:12:00.000Z	kajo	fryguy	explain?
2008-12-18T07:12:00.000Z	fryguy	kajo	sudo apt-get install cfdisk; cfdisk /dev/sdX, mark bootable, done
2008-12-18T07:12:00.000Z	kajo	fryguy	is cfdisk a gui?
2008-12-18T07:12:00.000Z	fryguy	kajo	no
2008-12-18T07:13:00.000Z	fryguy	kajo	it provides a user interface instead of menu driven
2008-12-18T07:17:00.000Z	fryguy	kajo	nothing, no idea why he's recommending it to you
2008-12-18T07:19:00.000Z	kajo	fryguy	but won't he need to upgrade manually to the latest version of flash 10 to have it work with pulseaudio?
2008-12-18T07:19:00.000Z	fryguy	kajo	no
2008-12-18T07:32:00.000Z	fryguy	kajo	using fat32 is almost certainly the wrong choice
2008-12-18T07:33:00.000Z	kajo	fryguy	but I want it to be able to be read by windows machines. Why is that a bad choice?
2008-12-18T07:33:00.000Z	kajo	fryguy	isn't that a good choice if I want to use Qino's within windows option?
2008-12-18T07:34:00.000Z	fryguy	kajo	use ntfs
2008-12-18T07:37:00.000Z	kajo	fryguy	why does xkill work so well? Random curiousity, xkill never seems to fail me, and is more immediate than any other method.
2008-12-18T07:38:00.000Z	fryguy	kajo	xkill sends a different signal to the window
2008-12-18T07:42:00.000Z	fryguy	kajo	you didn't tell anybody before that you were using a usb drive. so just use it
2008-12-18T07:42:00.000Z	kajo	fryguy	I've repeatedly said, from the beginning and throughout, that this was a usbdrive.
