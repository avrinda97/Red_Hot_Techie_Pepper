2006-01-16T15:19:00.000Z	Battlestar		what do i replace spaces with in my folder names if they have spaces in them
2006-01-16T15:19:00.000Z	Battlestar		as it is it interprets them as seperate folders
2006-01-16T15:20:00.000Z	Battlestar		hmmm i'm confused now. What's the path to the home folder? it says there is no such folder so i'm guessing it's not on the top level of the filesystem tree?
2006-01-16T15:22:00.000Z	Battlestar		ok what exactly is cd supposed to do
2006-01-16T15:23:00.000Z	Battlestar		if i put in "cd home" it just says there is no such directory
2006-01-16T15:24:00.000Z	Battlestar		hey dir works lol
2006-01-16T15:24:00.000Z	Battlestar		another windows command, yay
2006-01-16T15:25:00.000Z	Battlestar		lol
2006-01-16T15:25:00.000Z	levander	Battlestar	um, using 'dir' on UNIX probably isn't such a good practise to get into, i'd learn the 'ls' command, it's the same thing
2006-01-16T15:25:00.000Z	levander	Battlestar	yeah
2006-01-16T15:26:00.000Z	levander	Battlestar	you have no idea how much i had to learn about UNIX to get Linux installed the first time I installed it, ubuntu has spoiled you **way** too much.  I can't imagine getting Linux installed without knowing ls.
2006-01-16T15:26:00.000Z	levander	Battlestar	you're really going to have to read some stuff if you want to be any kind of productive
2006-01-16T15:27:00.000Z	Battlestar	levander	lol yea i know, i can get around the user interface ok but itgets messy whenever i start using console. Why doesn't someone just tell me how to change it so i am the owner without using the console
2006-01-16T15:28:00.000Z	levander	Battlestar	owner of what?
2006-01-16T15:29:00.000Z	Battlestar	levander	a folder i created. It has locked down the folder for some reaosn and won't let me modify privelages
2006-01-16T15:29:00.000Z	levander	Battlestar	try right clicking on the folder in nautilus
2006-01-16T15:30:00.000Z	Battlestar	levander	i'm not that thick; tried that but i just told u what it told me: not owner so i can't modify permissions
2006-01-16T15:31:00.000Z	levander	Battlestar	'sudo chown $USER <file name>'
2006-01-16T15:31:00.000Z	levander	Battlestar	replace <file name> with the name of the file
