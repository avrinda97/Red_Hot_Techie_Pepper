2010-02-10T23:59:00.000Z	jonzbcc		hello, I'm having trouble enabling apache (Server Side Includes) -- does anyone know why I might not be able to use them? I'm reading this: http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/howto/ssi.html#configuringyourservertopermitssi
2010-02-10T23:59:00.000Z	jonzbcc		I've placed the necessary directives in my .htaccess, and I've enabled (and restarted apache) the mod_include
2010-02-11T00:01:00.000Z	jonzbcc		no one's familiar with apache SSI?
2010-02-11T00:01:00.000Z	christopherdstam	jonzbcc	Isn't that just PHP?
2010-02-11T00:02:00.000Z	jonzbcc	christopherdstam	no, its not related to PHP. PHP is a scripting language, a separate entity from Apache, both as software and in functionality.

2010-02-11T00:04:00.000Z	jonzbcc	christopherdstam	thank you, but that's what I just linked to in my first question. I just read the whole article (a couple times, now)
2010-02-11T00:06:00.000Z	jonzbcc	christopherdstam	for some reason, after enabling the appropriate module (mod_include) and inserting the proper directives to .htaccess (mentioned in the beginning of the article)  -- I still have no success. It _does_ say, however, in the beginning of the article, that "Note that most configurations contain multiple Options directives that can override each other. "
2010-02-11T00:06:00.000Z	jonzbcc	christopherdstam	still, I don't know where to start, to tackle what might be overriding what
2010-02-11T00:06:00.000Z	christopherdstam	jonzbcc	try putting in in ur hhtpd.conf rather than htaccess
2010-02-11T00:08:00.000Z	christopherdstam	jonzbcc	 try it
2010-02-11T00:08:00.000Z	christopherdstam	jonzbcc	then make sure nothing in either config file is overrrding it
2010-02-11T00:09:00.000Z	jonzbcc	christopherdstam	that's the first thing I checked, but its a pretty heafty file, I don't know what would override it
2010-02-11T00:09:00.000Z	christopherdstam	jonzbcc	yes, debian uses apache2.conf
2010-02-11T00:10:00.000Z	jonzbcc	christopherdstam	lol, I did that too (its in my apache2.conf and my .htaccess)
2010-02-11T00:11:00.000Z	jonzbcc	christopherdstam	to be clear, its actually the last directive in the file, so I'm assuming the config file gets read top-down
2010-02-11T00:11:00.000Z	christopherdstam	jonzbcc	check this: http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/mod/core.html#options  and make sure that ur not using any options that would override it
2010-02-11T00:12:00.000Z	jonzbcc	christopherdstam	thanks, I'm reading it now.
2010-02-11T00:18:00.000Z	jonzbcc	christopherdstam	well, I just read over that whole section, but it only confirmed for me that I am indeed properly utilizing directives. :(
