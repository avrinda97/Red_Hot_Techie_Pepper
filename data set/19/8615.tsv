2011-06-16T06:49:00.000Z	dr_willis		sounds like you ght the name wrong..
2011-06-16T06:49:00.000Z	shaun	dr_willis	me? I can try again...
2011-06-16T06:50:00.000Z	dr_willis	shaun	 Case is imporntant.. and use the TAB key to auto-complete names
2011-06-16T06:52:00.000Z	shaun	dr_willis	Thank you. I simply copied the file over this time and it worked. However, all it did was produce a file in my home folder that has a bunch of weird characters, and in parenthesis at the end says "(Invalid Encoding)".
2011-06-16T06:52:00.000Z	dr_willis	shaun	sounds like a currupted download perhaps
2011-06-16T06:52:00.000Z	shaun	dr_willis	I downloaded right from the teamspeak site.
2011-06-16T06:53:00.000Z	dr_willis	shaun	 that dosent prove its a good download...
2011-06-16T06:53:00.000Z	dr_willis	shaun	 redownload, check the md5sums (assuming the site givet the sums)
2011-06-16T06:54:00.000Z	shaun	dr_willis	the site doesn't provide md5sums, at least not that I know.
2011-06-16T06:56:00.000Z	shaun	dr_willis	I am also trying to run a DUC that seems to be in the same state as the TS3 tar.gz file. No config files in the directory or anything... and ./configure doesn't work.
2011-06-16T06:57:00.000Z	shaun	dr_willis	I was running the server in Windows and someone recommended I switch to Ubuntu server, more light weight and better performance... but I can't figure it out D:
2011-06-16T07:02:00.000Z	dr_willis	shaun	 ciould be you are doing somthing fundametally/triivially wrong.. basically you download the tar.gz  and use 'tar xzvf thefilename' and the it should extract to some dir, you then cd into and run whatever app you are using.
2011-06-16T07:03:00.000Z	dr_willis	shaun	 its worth spending an hr or 2 learnig shell basics.
2011-06-16T07:03:00.000Z	shaun	dr_willis	I already have the file extracted to a directory and I was able to cd into it
2011-06-16T07:04:00.000Z	dr_willis	shaun	 if its SOURCE you confiogure/compuile it...
2011-06-16T07:04:00.000Z	dr_willis	shaun	 if its precompiled you just run it..
2011-06-16T07:04:00.000Z	shaun	dr_willis	How to I run it?
2011-06-16T07:05:00.000Z	shaun	dr_willis	I don't know what that command is xD I am sorry, I am completely lost.
2011-06-16T07:05:00.000Z	dr_willis	shaun	 so LOOK in the directory.
