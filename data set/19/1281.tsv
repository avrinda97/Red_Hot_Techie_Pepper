2012-05-04T12:23:00.000Z	fidel_	repozitor	afaik its no longer installed by default
2012-05-04T12:23:00.000Z	fidel_	repozitor	why couldnt you install it?
2012-05-04T12:23:00.000Z	repozitor	fidel_	i think 12.04 by defualt should have it, no need to install
2012-05-04T12:24:00.000Z	fidel_	repozitor	its pretty simple to test isnt it?
2012-05-04T12:28:00.000Z	repozitor	fidel_	^^ :D ?
2012-05-04T12:28:00.000Z	fidel_	repozitor	please try to use normal language and somehow full sentences. i dont know what the above should tell me
2012-05-04T12:30:00.000Z	fidel_	repozitor	and whats the question now?
2012-05-04T12:32:00.000Z	fidel_	repozitor	its up to you - launch them by terminal - launch them by alt+f2 - by a special launcher (i.e. Kupfer which is my personal choice)
2012-05-04T12:33:00.000Z	fidel_	repozitor	that depends on the user & the desktop-environment -> so it might differ what you prefer based on the fact if you are using unity, gnome-shell or whatewver else
2012-05-04T12:34:00.000Z	repozitor	fidel_	when i use alt+F2  dash home appear for me :((
2012-05-04T12:35:00.000Z	fidel_	repozitor	i cant help you with unity - as i dont use it.
2012-05-04T12:35:00.000Z	fidel_	repozitor	then dont use it
2012-05-04T12:36:00.000Z	fidel_	repozitor	yep i do use gnome-shell & kupfer as launcher
2012-05-04T12:38:00.000Z	repozitor	fidel_	what is suitable for progammer?
2012-05-04T12:39:00.000Z	fidel_	repozitor	i dont get your question - maybe ask the channel not just me
