2010-11-23T00:35:00.000Z	enathu		can anyone know how to backup to different location rather than home folder using remastersys Backup?
2010-11-23T00:37:00.000Z	enathu		I can't change the backup location as I am running out of space in my home dir. Does anyone know how to backup to different location rather than home folder using remastersys Backup?
2010-11-23T00:38:00.000Z	RottNKorpse	enathu	shouldnt backup to home anyway should backup to external drive or to the cloud...otherwise its pointless
2010-11-23T00:39:00.000Z	enathu	RottNKorpse	indeed. That's why I am here. Do you know how to change the backup default destination in Remastersys Backup?
2010-11-23T00:40:00.000Z	RottNKorpse	enathu	it should have some kind of preferences or options window but sorry I dont use that particular app - I use Back In Time and Simple Backup
2010-11-23T00:41:00.000Z	enathu	RottNKorpse	It doesn't have itself. By using Back In Time, can I able to backup all my settings and apps in my current installation?
2010-11-23T00:43:00.000Z	RottNKorpse	enathu	BIT can technically do that but its not that simple...it saves files and folders but since linux saves preferences into files it technically could
2010-11-23T00:45:00.000Z	enathu	RottNKorpse	I should check it out and I wanted to backup all my settings as I have customised all my setting to suits with my needs.
2010-11-23T00:46:00.000Z	RottNKorpse	enathu	backing up everything to sync it with another install isnt really possible but most apps have preference export like Compiz and Filezilla
2010-11-23T00:47:00.000Z	RottNKorpse	enathu	if you wanted to create an image of your install you could and then just install that image on a new machine
2010-11-23T00:48:00.000Z	enathu	RottNKorpse	but Remastersys Backup does it. It creates a iso image with your all settings. Unfortunately, I don't have the space to save the backup. It always creates the iso image in home folder.
2010-11-23T00:50:00.000Z	RottNKorpse	enathu	try this...it should help you http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/19446/make-a-drive-image-using-an-ubuntu-live-cd/
2010-11-23T00:50:00.000Z	enathu	RottNKorpse	How can I create an image of my current installation settings? Is there any other apps like Remastersys Backup available?
2010-11-23T00:51:00.000Z	enathu	RottNKorpse	Thanks for the link. I am checking it now..
2010-11-23T00:54:00.000Z	enathu	RottNKorpse	but, the post seems to describe how to make the clone of hard drive. Do you think, which can able me to restore my current installation to install another machine as it is?
2010-11-23T00:55:00.000Z	RottNKorpse	enathu	a clone is an exact copy of your current install so yea in theory
2010-11-23T00:59:00.000Z	RottNKorpse	enathu	not sure if it makes a live or not
2010-11-23T00:59:00.000Z	enathu	RottNKorpse	any way, thank you for your cool yet speedy responses. You rock man! :)
2010-11-23T01:02:00.000Z	RottNKorpse	enathu	welcome...whish I could help more
