2010-08-03T08:07:00.000Z	Karen_m		what does -gtk stand for?  gnome tool kit?
2010-08-03T08:07:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Karen_m	GIMP toolkit
2010-08-03T08:07:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Karen_m	Where GIMP is the GNU Image Manipulation Program.
2011-03-23T11:41:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Karen_m	How large is the USB drive?
2011-03-23T11:42:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Karen_m	That's enough for a normal install, which I prefer to a persistant Live install.
2011-03-23T11:42:00.000Z	Karen_m	Jordan_U	how do you install to the USB drive?
2011-03-23T11:44:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Karen_m	Easiest way is to boot from a LiveCD or another LiveUSB and do a normal install. If you have enough RAM (> 1GiB) you can also install from the same USB you booted from, but that's more difficult.
2011-03-23T11:45:00.000Z	Karen_m	Jordan_U	I would need to install from the USB i'm running on.  I do not have a cdrom in the machine
2011-03-23T11:45:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Karen_m	How much RAM do you have?
2011-03-23T11:50:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Karen_m	You need to pass the parameter "toram" to the kernel at boot, I'm not sure how to do that with a LiveUSB created by Startup Disk Creator / Unetbootin.
2011-03-23T11:52:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Karen_m	You're welcome.
2011-03-23T12:16:00.000Z	Karen_m	Jordan_U	how do I know if it successfully loaded TO RAM?
2011-03-23T12:17:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Karen_m	You'll be able to unmount (and even remove) the flash drive.
2011-03-23T12:17:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Karen_m	What is the output of "cat /proc/cmdline"?
2011-03-23T12:26:00.000Z	Karen_m	Jordan_U	<tab>, added toram on the line, now it's installing to the usb.. very nice! thank you
2011-03-24T01:20:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Karen_m	Toram might not work with a normal install. I've only ever used it with live sessions.
2011-03-24T01:30:00.000Z	Karen_m	Jordan_U	toram did not work :(
2011-08-19T01:26:00.000Z	Karen_m	Jordan_U	neat, thanks
2011-08-19T01:26:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Karen_m	You're welcome.
