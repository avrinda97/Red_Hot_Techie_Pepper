2005-09-18T05:58:00.000Z	delaney		the ubuntu live cd allows me to use my hdb1  but for some reason after installing 5.04 i am unable to access hdb1 at all.. i checked in cfdisk for fun to see if hdb1 showed up and it doesnt
2005-09-18T05:58:00.000Z	delaney		any suggestions?
2005-09-18T05:59:00.000Z	tga	delaney	cfdisk looks at your /dev/hda by default.. of course you can use your hdb1 as long as it's there
2005-09-18T05:59:00.000Z	delaney	tga	 its installed and in the computer.. set to slave.. and ive added it into my fstab
2005-09-18T05:59:00.000Z	delaney	tga	 as far as i know ive done it right.. yet nothing
2005-09-18T05:59:00.000Z	tga	delaney	try to mount it manually and see what happens
2005-09-18T06:00:00.000Z	delaney	tga	 mind helping me on that.. ive always just used fstab
2005-09-18T06:00:00.000Z	tga	delaney	mkdir /mnt/someplace && mount /dev/hdb1 /mnt/someplace
2005-09-18T06:00:00.000Z	delaney	tga	 created the /mnt/media mount point and all that like on the ubuntu guide
2005-09-18T06:00:00.000Z	tga	delaney	right, then mount /dev/hdb1 /mnt/media
2005-09-18T06:01:00.000Z	delaney	tga	 that works
2005-09-18T06:01:00.000Z	delaney	tga	 so im gonna assume my fstab is wrong?
2005-09-18T06:01:00.000Z	tga	delaney	what is your hdb1 fstab line?
2005-09-18T06:01:00.000Z	delaney	tga	 /dev/hdb1    /mnt/media   vfat  iocharset=utf8,umask000   0    0
2005-09-18T06:01:00.000Z	delaney	tga	 taken from ubuntuguide
2005-09-18T06:02:00.000Z	tga	delaney	first of all it's umask=0.. you need an equal sign in there
2005-09-18T06:02:00.000Z	delaney	tga	 its there sorry i missed it on typing it out
2005-09-18T06:04:00.000Z	tga	delaney	it looks right.. try getting rid of iocharset=utf8 unless you really need it
2005-09-18T06:04:00.000Z	delaney	tga	 ok
