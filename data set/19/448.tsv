2012-02-20T11:47:00.000Z	terminhell	WaffleGod	use them instead?

2012-02-20T11:53:00.000Z	terminhell	WaffleGod	i can think of some other work arounds that wont be easy, or even practical....
2012-02-20T11:55:00.000Z	WaffleGod	terminhell	do you think it would work anyway?
2012-02-20T11:56:00.000Z	WaffleGod	terminhell	would it work^
