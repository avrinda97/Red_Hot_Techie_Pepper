2012-09-12T20:02:00.000Z	Punisher_		i've encountered a bizzarre error....when i log in to my ubuntu 11.10, it asks me to enter a keyring....what is that? since without entering the password i cannot use my drives to write on them
2012-09-12T20:02:00.000Z	Punisher_		what should i do?
2012-09-12T20:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Punisher_	you can set a blank keyring pass and it won't bother you
2012-09-12T20:05:00.000Z	Punisher_	ActionParsnip	so why is the reason that i cannot download with vuze because it says failed to create a....directory on a drive which has plenty free space and it used to download the same file on it...file partially downloaded
2012-09-12T20:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Punisher_	are you trying to save torrent data to an NTFS partition by any chance?
2012-09-12T20:07:00.000Z	Punisher_	ActionParsnip	Yes i do
2012-09-12T20:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Punisher_	wanna know how I knew :)
2012-09-12T20:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Punisher_	did you mount the NTFS writable and writable as user
2012-09-12T20:08:00.000Z	Punisher_	ActionParsnip	yes i'm very eager to know how...and what is the problem
2012-09-12T20:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Punisher_	using NTFS can be a pain and when users say they have issues doing basic data storage it is nearly always because they are using junky NTFS
2012-09-12T20:09:00.000Z	Punisher_	ActionParsnip	I mount it as usual....
2012-09-12T20:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Punisher_	I suggest you check the mount options, make sure it i swritable and writable by users. If the partition is USB based then be sure you use the safe remove option before you unplug it
2012-09-12T20:10:00.000Z	Punisher_	ActionParsnip	so this problem arose suddenly? and what do u mean by Junky NTFS?
2012-09-12T20:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Punisher_	NTFS cannot hold Linux permissions, so you need to set the file accessing at mount time to apply to the whole storage rather than granular settings like the Lnux file systems you have
2012-09-12T20:11:00.000Z	Punisher_	ActionParsnip	how can i make sure that it is writable? no it's my hdd
2012-09-12T20:11:00.000Z	Punisher_	ActionParsnip	how can i do that?
2012-09-12T20:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Punisher_	add an option in /etc/fstab to mount the NTFS at boot and you can define the options to give users write access
2012-09-12T20:14:00.000Z	Punisher_	ActionParsnip	let me make myself clear.....i'm a begginer in ubuntu...so plz give me instructions so that i can do it....thnx dude
2012-09-12T20:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Punisher_	there are plenty of guides online for how to add an NTFS partition to /etc/fstab   I gotta jet now but a bit of searching online will show you how. Its not hard at all. You will need:  sudo blkid    to get the UUID of the NTFS partition and:  gksudo gedit /etc/fstab   to get write access to the file.
