2005-11-20T15:12:00.000Z	Seveas		you miss all libc headers
2005-11-20T15:13:00.000Z	polpak	Seveas	I don't have build-essentials installed, but I have stdio.h
2005-11-20T15:13:00.000Z	Seveas	polpak	then you have libc6-deb
2005-11-20T15:14:00.000Z	polpak	Seveas	yes.. If I'm going to develop C programs I'd need libc6-deb
2006-01-10T14:14:00.000Z	polpak	Seveas	why doesn't ubotu point people to the Starter Guide for Breezy to install the nvidia and ati drivers?
2006-01-10T15:24:00.000Z	polpak	Seveas	just curious, but why doesn't ubotu reference help.ubuntu.com/starterguide for the ATI and NVIDIA drivers?
2006-01-10T15:25:00.000Z	Seveas	polpak	because it links directly to the right instructions
2006-01-10T15:26:00.000Z	polpak	Seveas	I suppose.. But if people knew about the starter guide they might look there before asking another (different question) that is covered in it
2006-01-11T15:05:00.000Z	polpak	Seveas	why does ubotu send replies directly to me instead of to the channel?
2006-01-14T16:27:00.000Z	polpak	Seveas	does the dapper live CD work better for gparted resizing NTFS partitions? It just wouldn't do anything on the breezy live
2006-01-14T16:27:00.000Z	Seveas	polpak	ntfsresize has been functional since hoary...
2006-01-14T16:27:00.000Z	Seveas	polpak	maybe you need to defrag
2006-01-14T16:28:00.000Z	polpak	Seveas	perhaps, but I could successfully resize on a hoary live CD, or knoppix.
2006-01-14T16:28:00.000Z	Seveas	polpak	that's weird
2006-01-14T16:28:00.000Z	polpak	Seveas	yeah
2006-01-14T16:28:00.000Z	polpak	Seveas	I saw someone else mention something similiar
2006-01-14T16:29:00.000Z	polpak	Seveas	not that it matters to me much since I have no ntfs partitions anymore =))
2006-04-10T06:36:00.000Z	Seveas	polpak	no
2006-05-02T15:47:00.000Z	Seveas	polpak	?
