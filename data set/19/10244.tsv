2006-07-09T08:22:00.000Z	nix4me		mount ip:/dir /mnt/dir
2006-07-09T08:22:00.000Z	nix4me		thats all thats needed
2006-07-09T08:23:00.000Z	ultra	nix4me	yep, trying that but seems not working
2006-07-09T08:23:00.000Z	nix4me		you sure the share is active?
2006-07-09T08:23:00.000Z	ultra	nix4me	I think so, exportfs -v show me the share
2006-07-09T08:23:00.000Z	nix4me		check system->admin->shared folders
2006-07-09T08:24:00.000Z	ultra	nix4me	yes it is active
2006-07-09T08:25:00.000Z	nix4me		are the folder permission set accordingly?
2006-07-09T08:25:00.000Z	nix4me		ither than that, i have no idea
2006-07-09T08:25:00.000Z	ultra	nix4me	on the 2nd box, did a mount -t nfs /myshare /mymountpoint
2006-07-09T08:25:00.000Z	ultra	nix4me	permission set to the second linuxbox ip address
2006-07-09T08:26:00.000Z	nix4me		try just mount ip:/myshare /mymountpoint
2006-07-09T08:26:00.000Z	ultra	nix4me	sorry forgot to write it but did it with ip
2006-07-09T08:27:00.000Z	nix4me		and make sure the /mymountpoint is an actual dir
2006-07-09T08:28:00.000Z	ultra	nix4me	trying again without mount -t nfs now
2006-07-09T08:29:00.000Z	ultra	nix4me	arghh, works now, thanks a lot. I just removed the "-t nfs" and all working now. Thanks a lot for your help
2006-07-09T08:32:00.000Z	nix4me	ultra	also make sure you have portmap installed on the client side - it will speed up mounting
2006-07-09T08:32:00.000Z	nix4me	ultra	no probelm at all
2006-07-09T08:32:00.000Z	ultra	nix4me	did that :-)) thx again
