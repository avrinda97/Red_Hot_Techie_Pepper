2007-07-25T16:58:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie		suse hasn't been german for a while now :(
2007-07-25T16:59:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie		it got bought up by novell
2007-07-25T05:36:00.000Z	bruenig	howlingmadhowie	there shouldn't be, if one claims to be, it is probably someone who doesn't know what they are talking about
2007-07-25T05:37:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	bruenig	well, principally there are methods of making simple GUIs in shell scripts, but i thought the widget stuff was at least one level away from shell scripting :)
2007-07-25T05:38:00.000Z	bruenig	howlingmadhowie	there is stuff like xdialog and such but those aren't DE specific by any measure, maybe nautilus scripts are as close as you could get to what might be considered gnome scripts
2007-07-25T05:39:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	bruenig	exactly that, xdialog :)
2007-07-25T05:51:00.000Z	bruenig	howlingmadhowie	they do the same thing, I read someone where that ` was deprecated so I don't use it, the dollar parenthesis are easier to read too I think
2007-07-25T05:52:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	bruenig	i just find it easy for perl scripting :)
2007-07-25T06:14:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	bruenig	i think they're amaing for turing completeness :)
2007-07-28T12:48:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	bruenig	i think they mean reinstalling the part of grub which lives in the mbr to the mbr and updating menu.lst :)
2007-07-28T12:49:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	bruenig	lol!
2007-07-28T14:36:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	bruenig	nice :)
2007-07-28T14:37:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	bruenig	i particularly like your use of the pipe symbol to seperate fields in a sed replacement command :) very classy :)
2007-07-28T14:39:00.000Z	bruenig	howlingmadhowie	I go back and forth, I am very inconsistent, sometimes even in the same script, I will read back and realize that I have used / and |, my brain is odd
2007-07-28T14:40:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	bruenig	it just took me a while to read it, because i was reading it as a pipe :) have a look at this: http://www.thc.org/root/phun/unmaintain.html
2007-07-28T14:41:00.000Z	bruenig	howlingmadhowie	pipes are actually better for sed because you don't have to escape / when you use them
2007-07-28T14:41:00.000Z	bruenig	howlingmadhowie	but sometimes it won't work with pipes, sed is very fickle
2007-07-28T14:41:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	bruenig	seeing as i'm using an international keyboard, i like using  :)
2007-07-28T14:45:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	bruenig	a pity. you can't use  as a field separator in sed. looks like it has to be a non-alpha-numerik ascii symbol :(
