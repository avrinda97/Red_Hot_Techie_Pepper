2009-06-05T08:17:00.000Z	digitalvaldosta		:'( I still do not have a User List at GDM login prompt. Does anyone have any ideas? I have set the Login Window Manager's Local tab 'Style' setting to Themed with face browser.
2009-06-05T08:17:00.000Z	digitalvaldosta		:'( I have also restarted my computer. This has been like this for the last three days
2009-06-05T08:18:00.000Z	cabrey	digitalvaldosta	make sure the Theme: is set to selected only
2009-06-05T08:20:00.000Z	digitalvaldosta	cabrey	that has never mattered before.
2009-06-05T08:20:00.000Z	cabrey	digitalvaldosta	yes it does, if Random from selected is selected, then your theme wont be used
2009-06-05T08:21:00.000Z	digitalvaldosta	cabrey	I tried both
2009-06-05T08:21:00.000Z	cabrey	digitalvaldosta	can you screenshot your login window preferences screen for us?
2009-06-05T08:22:00.000Z	digitalvaldosta	cabrey	yes

2009-06-05T08:26:00.000Z	cabrey	digitalvaldosta	does that theme support face browsing?
2009-06-05T08:27:00.000Z	cabrey	digitalvaldosta	tbh it doesnt look like it
2009-06-05T08:27:00.000Z	digitalvaldosta	cabrey	YES. I have tried the ones that come with ubuntu also. I am not new to themes for the GDM. I just have never had this issue.
2009-06-05T08:28:00.000Z	cabrey	digitalvaldosta	and do the other themes with face browser work?
2009-06-05T08:28:00.000Z	digitalvaldosta	cabrey	no
2009-06-05T08:28:00.000Z	cabrey	digitalvaldosta	hmm is your system fully up to date?
2009-06-05T08:29:00.000Z	digitalvaldosta	cabrey	yes, up to date. I have even used Human List.
2009-06-05T08:29:00.000Z	cabrey	digitalvaldosta	sounds like a major bug
2009-06-05T08:29:00.000Z	digitalvaldosta	cabrey	with Human List the area that should have the user list has only a white box
2009-06-05T08:30:00.000Z	cabrey	digitalvaldosta	you might want to take it to launchpad :/
