2007-10-08T15:37:00.000Z	Zborg		hello :)
2007-10-08T15:38:00.000Z	Zborg		I have a problem with smb mounts
2007-10-08T15:38:00.000Z	Zborg		ok ;)
2007-10-08T15:38:00.000Z	Zborg		I mounted networks virtual disks
2007-10-08T15:38:00.000Z	Zborg		well, windows shares actually
2007-10-08T15:39:00.000Z	Zborg		and it works fin most of the time
2007-10-08T15:39:00.000Z	Zborg		the problem is, with firefox, I can't access these shares when I want to access a file
2007-10-08T15:39:00.000Z	Zborg		like when you want to attach a file to a mail in a webmail
2007-10-08T15:39:00.000Z	Zborg		(that's the case with OWA)
2007-10-08T15:39:00.000Z	ikonia	Zborg	how are you trying to access a share with firefox, firefox is a web browser
2007-10-08T15:40:00.000Z	ikonia	Zborg	ahh I see
2007-10-08T15:40:00.000Z	ikonia	Zborg	can you not see the mount points, or are they there and not accessable ?
2007-10-08T15:40:00.000Z	ikonia	Zborg	ahh thats not actually mounting them as a local file system
2007-10-08T15:41:00.000Z	ikonia	Zborg	yeah, thats right, but they are not "standard" file systems on the desktop
2007-10-08T15:41:00.000Z	ikonia	Zborg	no, as they are not mounted as a local file system
2007-10-08T15:47:00.000Z	ikonia	Zborg	usse autmounter
2007-10-08T15:47:00.000Z	ikonia	Zborg	much better than a .profile
2007-10-08T15:48:00.000Z	Zborg	ikonia	I'll have a look at that, thanks
2007-10-08T15:48:00.000Z	ikonia	Zborg	much more effective
