2009-06-17T08:03:00.000Z	StephenZ		Digisapien: At your own risk... sudo bash
2009-06-17T08:03:00.000Z	StephenZ		Why not? What's wrong with it? If it's making life harder on me, I'd love to know how.
2009-06-17T08:03:00.000Z	StephenZ		<3
2009-06-17T08:03:00.000Z	StephenZ		Odd.
2009-06-17T08:04:00.000Z	StephenZ		How is sudo bash bad?
2009-06-17T08:04:00.000Z	StephenZ		I've never tried it.
2009-06-17T08:04:00.000Z	StephenZ		Based on...?
2009-06-17T08:05:00.000Z	StephenZ		sudo bash gives me a root@domain prompt.
2009-06-17T08:05:00.000Z	Ghoti	StephenZ	sudo bash doesn't update your environment though; a misplaced ~ could be disaster.
2009-06-17T08:06:00.000Z	StephenZ	Ghoti	Ahhh, thank you. So what would work better, sudo -s?
2009-06-17T08:06:00.000Z	StephenZ		Or, rather...
2009-06-17T08:06:00.000Z	StephenZ		HOW would it work better?
2009-06-17T08:06:00.000Z	Ghoti	StephenZ	if you insist on not using sudo, then sudo -s to get a superuser shell is the "best" plan.
2009-06-17T08:07:00.000Z	StephenZ	Ghoti	I don't typically insist on it; gives me another layer of "I have less chance to screw things up with a typo."
2009-06-17T08:08:00.000Z	StephenZ		Anyhow, I'm off to see if installing Ibis will fix my boot problems.
2009-06-17T08:08:00.000Z	Ghoti	StephenZ	That's one reason that using sudo is safer- if you forget to sudo, you get another chance to think "do I realy want to [insert potentially catastrophic command here]"?
2009-06-17T08:09:00.000Z	Ghoti	StephenZ	exactly my point.  I also accidentally once typoed a / where a . should have been with an rm -r command, and REALLY bad things could have happened if I was root.
