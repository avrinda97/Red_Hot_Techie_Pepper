2011-03-28T17:38:00.000Z	ZieLonKa		hi again... ive got a problem with compiling a 3com-driver... can anybody help me?
2011-03-28T17:40:00.000Z	ZieLonKa		can nobody help me?
2011-03-28T17:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ZieLonKa	 why are you compiling a driver for that?
2011-03-28T17:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ZieLonKa	 Most wired nic drivers are allready incluided.. and i would think most 3com drivers are allready there also.
2011-03-28T17:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ZieLonKa	 this is a wired card? or wireless?
2011-03-28T17:44:00.000Z	ZieLonKa	Dr_Willis	this is a wired card.
2011-03-28T17:46:00.000Z	ZieLonKa	Dr_Willis	i also thought, that linux got the drivers, lspci shows me the device, but ifconfig does not show eth1 and when i try to 'ifconfig eth1 up' the interface, I get a 'no such device'
2011-03-28T17:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ZieLonKa	 you may need to determine the exact chipset.
2011-03-28T17:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ZieLonKa	 ive rarely found a Wired NIC that dident work from the beginning.
2011-03-28T17:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ZieLonKa	 keep it in the channel. I may have to l eave at any time.
2011-03-28T17:48:00.000Z	ZieLonKa	Dr_Willis	yeah, so how do i do this? im real new to linux
2011-03-28T17:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ZieLonKa	 pastebin the lspci output for the channel to see for starters.
2011-03-29T20:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ZieLonKa	 use the 'text' kernel boot option = no gdm, no fancy splash.
2011-03-29T20:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ZieLonKa	 or just disable teh gdm service in /etc/init/ by renaming gdm.conf to be like gdm.DONTRUN
2011-03-29T20:57:00.000Z	ZieLonKa	Dr_Willis	where must i set this 'text-mode' setting to get ubuntu start with it as default?
2011-03-29T20:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ZieLonKa	 /etc/default/grub
2011-03-29T20:57:00.000Z	ZieLonKa	Dr_Willis	thanks!
2011-03-29T20:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ZieLonKa	 replace 'quiet splash' with 'text'
2011-03-29T20:58:00.000Z	ZieLonKa	Dr_Willis	btw... my nic problem from yesterday is now solved, i just switched the cards ;)
