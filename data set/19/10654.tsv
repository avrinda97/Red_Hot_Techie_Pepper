2006-08-07T15:43:00.000Z	rixxon		is there any program in the repos that works like the windows net program?
2006-08-07T15:44:00.000Z	mwe	rixxon	there is not one program like that. there are several more advanced tools though
2006-08-07T15:45:00.000Z	rixxon	mwe	no, the net command, it communicate over netbios/msrpc/msds not sure
2006-08-07T15:46:00.000Z	mwe	rixxon	yes. like I said there is not a program that works the same way but there are several more advanced tools
2006-08-07T15:46:00.000Z	rixxon	mwe	it doesn't matter if it is more capable :p
2006-08-07T15:46:00.000Z	mwe	rixxon	what do you need to do in particular?
2006-08-07T15:47:00.000Z	rixxon	mwe	is there nothing with full support for what them typical windows port does?
2006-08-07T15:47:00.000Z	rixxon	mwe	135,139,445
2006-08-07T15:50:00.000Z	mwe	rixxon	what do you want to do? you can mount shares and so. do you want to control windows remotely or what?
2006-08-07T15:50:00.000Z	rixxon	mwe	remote administration yes
2006-08-07T15:50:00.000Z	mwe	rixxon	you'd probably wanna use vnc
2006-08-07T15:51:00.000Z	mwe	rixxon	linux doesn't know that
2006-08-07T15:51:00.000Z	rixxon	mwe	hence the question =)
2006-08-07T15:51:00.000Z	mwe	rixxon	you'll have to look for alternatives
2006-08-07T15:51:00.000Z	rixxon	mwe	which was my question. is there such an alternative
2006-08-07T15:52:00.000Z	mwe	rixxon	not one that works the same way
2006-08-07T15:52:00.000Z	mwe	rixxon	rdesktop, vnc
2006-08-07T15:52:00.000Z	mwe	rixxon	rdesktop is great
2006-08-07T15:53:00.000Z	rixxon	mwe	i doubt it is scriptable?
