2006-10-02T14:31:00.000Z	ladydoor	cpl-tnt44	sudo aptitude install ndiswrapper-source ndiswrapper-utils
2006-10-02T14:32:00.000Z	ladydoor	cpl-tnt44	there's still some setup to do after that, but it's explained in the man page.
2006-10-02T14:32:00.000Z	cpl-tnt44	ladydoor	: thanks , btw can i do it through  the add\remove ?
2006-10-02T14:33:00.000Z	ladydoor	cpl-tnt44	i don't know what that is. it's not too hard to copy/paste that in...
2006-10-02T14:33:00.000Z	ladydoor	cpl-tnt44	no problem.
2006-10-02T14:38:00.000Z	ladydoor	cpl-tnt44	yeah. did you say something?
2006-10-02T14:39:00.000Z	cpl-tnt44	ladydoor	, yes once i installed it , how can i wire it to my wireless card
2006-10-02T14:39:00.000Z	ladydoor	cpl-tnt44	please read the manual--as i said, most of the information is in the manpage. if you need any clarification on something specific in there, feel free to ask :-)
2006-10-02T14:41:00.000Z	cpl-tnt44	ladydoor	, quastion,,,

2006-10-02T14:44:00.000Z	cpl-tnt44	ladydoor	: after installing the ndiswrapper how do i use it to clearfy it as the driver for my wireless card...
2006-10-02T14:44:00.000Z	ladydoor	cpl-tnt44	well, as it says in there, you need to point it to your driver's inf file with sudo ndiswrapper -i /path/to/driver, first, then do sudo ndiswrapper -l (it *should* say "Driver present, hardware present" or something like that), then sudo ndiswrapper -m, then sudo modprobe ndiswrapper...
2006-10-02T14:44:00.000Z	ladydoor	cpl-tnt44	then take down your wired interface (sudo ifdown eth0) and bring up your wireless (sudo ifup wlan0)
2006-10-02T14:45:00.000Z	ladydoor	cpl-tnt44	if any of that needs clarifying, i'd be glad to do so :-)
2006-10-02T14:46:00.000Z	cpl-tnt44	ladydoor	:  can u poing me to the specific page u found ?
2006-10-02T14:46:00.000Z	ladydoor	cpl-tnt44	what page are you talking about?
