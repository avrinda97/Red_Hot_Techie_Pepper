2005-07-04T16:33:00.000Z	alberto_		so has anyone here battled this problem ?
2005-07-04T16:33:00.000Z	cam	alberto_	is your sound card supported in linux?
2005-07-04T16:34:00.000Z	cam	alberto_	is the module loaded?
2005-07-04T16:35:00.000Z	cam	alberto_	but what's the output from your kernel log or dmes or whatever
2005-07-04T16:39:00.000Z	cam	alberto_	what module are you using for your sound card?
2005-07-04T16:39:00.000Z	cam	alberto_	or what kind of sound card do you have in there?
2005-07-04T16:40:00.000Z	cam	alberto_	?
2005-07-04T16:43:00.000Z	cam	alberto_	yeah
2005-07-04T16:43:00.000Z	cam	alberto_	hey, dump the lspci stuff over there too
2005-07-04T16:47:00.000Z	cam	alberto_	i found this in the ubuntu forums: I experimented further and discovered that by unloading and reloading the snd_atiixp module sound worked, although I had to unmute everything and turn up the volume. Today sound worked without ant intervention from me. Very strange.
2005-07-04T16:47:00.000Z	cam	alberto_	it's a guy w/ the same card/problem as you, you could give it a whirl
2005-07-04T16:51:00.000Z	cam	alberto_	ok, there's a related error i found on google
2005-07-04T16:51:00.000Z	cam	alberto_	check this link out: http://www.linuxcompatible.org/No_sound_since_upgrade_to_Fedora_Core_2_Kernal_2.6.8-1.521_t28449.html
2005-07-04T16:51:00.000Z	cam	alberto_	i gotta go home, there's tons of crap about your card on the web, search around
