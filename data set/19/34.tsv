2012-11-25T19:45:00.000Z	bekks	JediAEL	You dont need vbox for inserting a CD and just copy your data back.
2012-11-25T19:46:00.000Z	bekks	JediAEL	Just insert the Ubuntu installation cd, reboot from CD, and follow the instructions on screen.
2012-11-25T19:47:00.000Z	bekks	JediAEL	You have to burn one.

2012-11-25T19:53:00.000Z	bekks	JediAEL	Dont you have a CD/DVD drive in your laptop?
2012-11-25T19:55:00.000Z	bekks	JediAEL	Just download an Ubuntu CD and burn it with one of the zillion burning applications in windows.

2012-11-25T19:58:00.000Z	JediAEL	bekks	Windows 8 gives a return of 7 when typing //say $os , it is Windows 7 RT aka Windows 8 but people are calling it Vista 8 because of the bad reputation of Vista OS and how Win 8 is as buggy as Vista
2012-11-25T19:58:00.000Z	bekks	JediAEL	I dontcare how peoplecall it. I just know dual booting works up to Windows 2012.
