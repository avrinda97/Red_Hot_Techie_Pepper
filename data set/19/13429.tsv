2005-04-03T16:26:00.000Z	smouche		don't you hate that stuff
2005-04-03T16:26:00.000Z	smouche		I want an ubuntu t-shirt.  anything but brown, please
2005-04-03T10:06:00.000Z	smouche		oh oh kkathman_ -- apt-get clear?  I upgraded warty to hoary, didn't know about the :"apt-get clear"  part -- upgrade seemed ok for me, though...
2005-04-03T10:07:00.000Z	smouche		should I have used "apt-get clear"? (newbie)
2005-04-03T10:07:00.000Z	kkathman_	smouche	- someone told me that it was always a good thing to do...the clear...that way you start with a good slate
2005-04-03T10:07:00.000Z	kkathman_		hell if I know what that means
2005-04-03T10:08:00.000Z	kkathman_		yanno - one of those things you pick up from someone that you think knows
2005-04-03T10:08:00.000Z	smouche	kkathman_	or anyone, what exactly is being "cleared" ?
2005-04-03T10:08:00.000Z	kkathman_	smouche	- no clue dude
2005-04-03T10:08:00.000Z	kkathman_		like i said...was suggested by one of those peeps that seemed to know
2005-04-03T10:08:00.000Z	smouche		I had hoped that the package updates would magically sort out warty, hoary conflicts -- anyway, maybe I got lucky.
2005-04-03T10:09:00.000Z	kkathman_		I dont think clear has anything to do with sync
2005-04-03T10:10:00.000Z	kkathman_		yanno I meant clean..not clear
2005-04-03T10:10:00.000Z	kkathman_		dont know why I said clear :)
2005-04-03T10:11:00.000Z	kkathman_		clean clears out the local repository of retrieved package files.
2005-04-03T10:11:00.000Z	smouche		the ubuntu web site is done with plone/zope -- that stuff runs on python, right?
2005-04-03T10:11:00.000Z	kkathman_		thats why I remember it as clear :)
2005-04-03T10:11:00.000Z	smouche		thanks, kkathman_
2005-04-03T10:12:00.000Z	kkathman_	smouche	- do a man apt-get its all in there
