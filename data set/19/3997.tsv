2009-04-28T19:43:00.000Z	kromar		ok the problem seems not to be the music palyer, i cant load any files in a player somehow. any idea what the problem could be?
2009-04-28T19:44:00.000Z	dbarnett	kromar	you may have to enable non-free sources and install the codecs
2009-04-28T19:53:00.000Z	dbarnett	kromar	something tells me it's not impossible to play music on 9.04
2009-04-28T19:54:00.000Z	kromar	dbarnett	well then tell me how it works, i cant load music files in the player
2009-04-28T19:54:00.000Z	dbarnett	kromar	have you tried all the suggestions people have offered here? codecs? volume?
2009-04-28T19:54:00.000Z	kromar	dbarnett	yes and thats not the problem. i cant load the files into the player
2009-04-28T19:54:00.000Z	dbarnett	kromar	what error do you get?
2009-04-28T19:55:00.000Z	kromar	dbarnett	how can i remove the player settings and start with default?
2009-04-28T19:55:00.000Z	kromar	dbarnett	i dont get an error, theres just nothing happening
2009-04-28T19:55:00.000Z	dbarnett	kromar	have you tried another player? try deleting .gmplayer (or something like that)
2009-04-28T19:55:00.000Z	dbarnett	kromar	try moving it efore deleting
2009-04-28T19:56:00.000Z	kromar	dbarnett	its not loading them into the player
2009-04-28T19:56:00.000Z	kromar	dbarnett	where exactly are the settings stored?
2009-04-28T19:57:00.000Z	dbarnett	kromar	I have no idea. I don't use gmplayer
2009-04-28T19:57:00.000Z	dbarnett	kromar	try a different player. If that works you can rule out some things
2009-04-28T19:58:00.000Z	kromar	dbarnett	works with vlc player, so why the hell cant i load those files in gmusicbrowser? everything worked fine pre 9.04
2009-04-28T19:59:00.000Z	dbarnett	kromar	it doesn't sound like an ubuntu issue, you might want to check the forums for gmusicbrowser. I not familiar with that at all
2009-04-28T20:00:00.000Z	dbarnett	kromar	got to run to a meeting. Good luck
2009-04-28T20:00:00.000Z	kromar	dbarnett	i cant find a .gmusicbroswer file there...
