2006-10-23T05:57:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	slop|lap	You want a dvd to popup in an app when you put the movie in the drive?
2006-10-23T05:57:00.000Z	slop|lap	ianmacgregor	i just want it to play dvds
2006-10-23T05:57:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	slop|lap	System -> Preferences -> Removable Drives and Media
2006-10-23T05:57:00.000Z	slop|lap	ianmacgregor	i don't want it to set to automatically play, i just want it to work :P
2006-10-23T05:58:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	slop|lap	So, you don't want the movie auto play, but you want the app to popup on the desktop so you can play the movie???
2006-10-23T05:59:00.000Z	slop|lap	ianmacgregor	no lol...it won't play dvds...i'm just mentioning that it doesn't pop up on the desktop as a clue to why it won't play...i'm thinking it might not recognize dvd's or something
2006-10-23T05:59:00.000Z	slop|lap	ianmacgregor	i just want to be able to play dvds on my laptop
2006-10-23T06:00:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	slop|lap	Ok, here's how to get the icon to popup on the desktop. Applications -> System -> Configuration editor. Open that and let me know when it's open
2006-10-23T06:00:00.000Z	slop|lap	ianmacgregor	ok , doing that
2006-10-23T06:00:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	slop|lap	When the conf editor is open, go to the left pane and go to apps/nautilus/desktop
2006-10-23T06:03:00.000Z	slop|lap	ianmacgregor	i do, it's installed
2006-10-23T06:09:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	slop|lap	Run gmplayer, go to the prefs, go to the Misc tab and at the bottom, set your dirves up
2006-10-23T06:11:00.000Z	slop|lap	ianmacgregor	i can't...when i run it, it just locks up, doesn't even give me menus to click on or anythhing, just two blank boxes
2006-10-23T06:12:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	slop|lap	Are you using gnome with xgl or compiz?
2006-10-23T06:12:00.000Z	slop|lap	ianmacgregor	nope, just standard install
2006-10-23T06:12:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	slop|lap	Did you install mplayer from the repos?
2006-10-23T06:13:00.000Z	slop|lap	ianmacgregor	yes
