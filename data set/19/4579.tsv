2011-08-20T10:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	krishnan	 How did you install ubuntu server to thge  usb? You  did notuse a tool like Unetbootin or similer to put the server iso on a pendrive did you?
2011-08-20T10:08:00.000Z	krishnan	Dr_Willis	I used the tool that is given in the ubuntu desktop OS. The tool and the step tht is mentioned in the ubuntu.com site.
2011-08-20T10:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	krishnan	 so you did not boot a cd/usb and did a normal install - you used one of the  'live disk' creator tools? I belive the server iso does not work with those. Only the livd-desktop cd  does
2011-08-20T10:10:00.000Z	krishnan	Dr_Willis	I followed ths link. http://www.ubuntu.com/download/server/download . The same iso file works fine in a virtual box.
2011-08-20T10:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	krishnan	 have vbox boot the pendrive as a test
2011-08-20T10:11:00.000Z	krishnan	Dr_Willis	of will do tht.

2011-08-20T10:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	krishnan	 sounds like a badly made usb. You could try that tools at pendrivelinux that make a grub2 setup that boots an ISO file.. it might work better
2011-08-20T10:18:00.000Z	krishnan	Dr_Willis	will try tht & come back.
2011-08-20T10:35:00.000Z	krishnan	Dr_Willis	While I was using the USB Installer suggested by you I got a message stating tht a error has occured while installaing syslinux and hence the device will not be bootable.
2011-08-20T22:31:00.000Z	krishnan	Dr_Willis	While trying to create a USB stick with Ubuntu 10.04 server OS the process is throwing an error mentioning syslinux not able to install. Tried doing in both linux and windows same error occurs. What to do?
2011-08-20T22:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	krishnan	 last i heard the SERVER iso would not work properly when put on a usb stick. You could set up grub2 to boot it i belive.. but its been ages ago.
2011-08-20T22:33:00.000Z	krishnan	Dr_Willis	will I be able to install grub after the installation on usb stick is over. If yes pls tell me how?
2011-08-20T22:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	krishnan	 personally i would check the pendrivelinux web site. they ahve tools that put grub2 on the pendrive and puts the iso there as well.
2011-08-20T22:36:00.000Z	krishnan	Dr_Willis	tht did not help much still I will have a look. Thanks a lot!
