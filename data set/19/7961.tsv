2007-05-26T05:42:00.000Z	DgrMouse		can someone please help me with the command to download and install gnome on my new 6.06 server pls?
2007-05-26T05:42:00.000Z	orbin	DgrMouse	installing the ubuntu-desktop metapackage should grab everything for you
2007-05-26T05:51:00.000Z	orbin	DgrMouse	out of interest, why didn't you just grab the desktop iso if you wanted gnome?
2007-05-26T06:08:00.000Z	orbin	DgrMouse	have a look at the /etc/apt/sources.list file
2007-05-26T06:09:00.000Z	orbin	DgrMouse	nothing at all?
2007-05-26T06:11:00.000Z	orbin	DgrMouse	sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list  ... sudo gives you admin write ability to the file, and nano is the name of the console editor you wish to view the file.
2007-05-26T06:12:00.000Z	DgrMouse	orbin	thanks.. i will try.. what should be in there as default?
2007-05-26T06:14:00.000Z	orbin	DgrMouse	are you on another computer currently?
2007-05-26T06:18:00.000Z	DgrMouse	orbin	looks like my sources.list file was completely commented out
2007-05-26T06:19:00.000Z	orbin	DgrMouse	did you uncomment the deb lines?
2007-05-26T06:23:00.000Z	DgrMouse	orbin	I did, and it still won't go and look for the packages
2007-05-26T06:24:00.000Z	orbin	DgrMouse	did you do an update?
2007-05-26T06:24:00.000Z	orbin	DgrMouse	sudo aptitude update
2007-05-26T06:24:00.000Z	orbin	DgrMouse	after you saved the changes to the file that is
2007-05-26T06:33:00.000Z	DgrMouse	orbin	I found half the problem.... network cable was plugged into the wrong NIC port
2007-05-26T06:35:00.000Z	orbin	DgrMouse	yes, that may have affected things...
2007-05-26T06:37:00.000Z	DgrMouse	orbin	after getting the right port, un-commenting the lines in sources.list and the aptitude update, it's now downloading ubuntu-desktop.  Thanks for your patience
2007-05-26T06:39:00.000Z	orbin	DgrMouse	sure, hope everything goes smoothly for you
2007-05-26T06:39:00.000Z	DgrMouse	orbin	Well.. so far so good.. next step is find a vmware package, if someone has made it
