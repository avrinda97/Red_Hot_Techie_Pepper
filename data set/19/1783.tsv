2011-02-13T17:09:00.000Z	Gaspode		My system will no longer boot into anything! can anyone help please?
2011-02-13T17:11:00.000Z	Gaspode		I can see grub. Then system hangs when starting. Can't boot into live CD just blankscreen
2011-02-13T17:11:00.000Z	rigved	Gaspode	did you install a new OS on this machine?
2011-02-13T17:12:00.000Z	Gaspode	rigved	No it has been working for months, just shutdown as normal yesterday.
2011-02-13T17:14:00.000Z	rigved	Gaspode	when you boot, can you confirm that even though your monitor is blank, your machine (like hard disk) is still running?
2011-02-13T17:15:00.000Z	Gaspode	rigved	As far as I can tell. I can see it in BIOS and it will list options in Grub
2011-02-13T17:16:00.000Z	rigved	Gaspode	no i mean, after the grub menu, can you still hear your machine working?
2011-02-13T17:17:00.000Z	Gaspode	rigved	As far as I can tell. Do you want me to take it apart?
2011-02-13T17:17:00.000Z	rigved	Gaspode	if after you select an option in the grub menu, nothing is displayed on the screen even though your machine is running, then it means that you have a graphics card problem
2011-02-13T17:18:00.000Z	rigved	Gaspode	can you boot into recovery mode and select the failsafex graphics mode
2011-02-13T17:20:00.000Z	Gaspode	rigved	If for example I press esc and then select 10.04 LTS 2.6.32-28-generic (recovery mode) it starts loading and then hangs after NET: Registered protocol family 1
2011-02-13T17:22:00.000Z	rigved	Gaspode	do you see any error message?
2011-02-13T17:24:00.000Z	Gaspode	rigved	Some iomem range could not be reserved messages. It gets past those. Registers protocal family 2, then family 1 (no errors) then stops
2011-02-13T17:26:00.000Z	Gaspode	rigved	Memtest86 does not report any errors.
2011-02-13T17:28:00.000Z	rigved	Gaspode	those unkown range error messages, maybe related to memory even though memtest didn't report anything. can you remove your RAM sticks and reset them?
2011-02-13T17:29:00.000Z	Gaspode	rigved	Yes OK - give me a few mins..
2011-02-13T17:29:00.000Z	rigved	Gaspode	ok
2011-02-13T17:37:00.000Z	Gaspode	rigved	Thany you so much :-) It's working now. You are a star!!
2011-02-13T17:39:00.000Z	rigved	Gaspode	np. you are welcome!
