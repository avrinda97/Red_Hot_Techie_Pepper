2011-10-27T08:31:00.000Z	galmo		Hey folks, I'm in ubuntu 11.04 and looking to find a decent windows emulator that runs well on a slower machine
2011-10-27T08:32:00.000Z	galmo		however i don't want something like, vmware or virtualbox that creates a whole thing, and the main program I want to run crashes in wine all the time
2011-10-27T08:32:00.000Z	galmo		i've been looking a while now and haven't come across anything that really impressed me
2011-10-27T08:33:00.000Z	galmo		i'm just saying i don't want a whole virtual desktop because this computer is fairly old and slow and i have enough performance issues as it is
2011-10-27T08:33:00.000Z	galmo		pokerstars mainly
2011-10-27T08:34:00.000Z	galmo		yeah i'm looking for something similar to wine that's light and doesn't require allocating ram and resources like a virtual machine does
2011-10-27T08:35:00.000Z	gulzar	galmo	: wine has no alternative.
2011-10-27T08:36:00.000Z	gulzar	galmo	virtualization with qemu or Virtualbox is possible but with old hardware wine is the solution .
2011-10-27T08:36:00.000Z	gulzar	galmo	if wine is not working then no luck... YOu have to wait for your app supprot in wine
2011-10-27T08:38:00.000Z	gulzar	galmo	go to wine HQ and see if any disktro support your app . Different distro have different (slight) performance with wine.
2011-10-27T08:39:00.000Z	gulzar	galmo	try Debian LXDE . IT takes only 112MB on my machine with gnome apps
2011-10-27T08:40:00.000Z	gulzar	galmo	with it you can easily run VB
2011-10-27T08:41:00.000Z	gulzar	galmo	: then install LXDE on ubuntu and use it.... though it takes around  190MB ..
2011-10-27T08:41:00.000Z	gulzar	galmo	ya very less
2011-10-27T08:41:00.000Z	gulzar	galmo	try to use names to address a user
2011-10-27T08:42:00.000Z	galmo	gulzar	yep no problem
2011-10-27T08:42:00.000Z	gulzar	galmo	it is very confusing with lots of talks here
2011-10-27T08:42:00.000Z	gulzar	galmo	:)
2011-10-27T08:42:00.000Z	galmo	gulzar	yeah i was kind of noticing that, no problem
