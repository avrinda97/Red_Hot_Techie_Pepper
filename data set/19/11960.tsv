2010-01-28T20:12:00.000Z	erUSUL	jenda_	RX packets:4422 errors:1579 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:1579 a lot of errors ?
2010-01-28T20:13:00.000Z	erUSUL	jenda_	dunno whay again; what are the nic chip on the bad machine ? is same cable/router etc?
2010-01-28T20:13:00.000Z	jenda_	erUSUL	it's an NVidia nForce 10/100/1000 integrated, I think.
2010-01-28T20:13:00.000Z	jenda_	erUSUL	on an M4N82 ASUS motherboard.
2010-01-28T20:14:00.000Z	jenda_	erUSUL	otherwise, I just connected it with a cable that arrived today, and I think the problems were there even with the old cable (or, might have been different problems, lemme check that)
2010-01-28T20:15:00.000Z	erUSUL	jenda_	well nforce nic are not know for stellar performance/reliability in linux but anyway really dunno what may be the problem would be nice if you could try a cheap pci nic card
2010-01-28T20:23:00.000Z	jenda_	erUSUL	it's similar under Windows 7 with official drivers, and it's the same with another cable ( http://pastebin.com/m48fbb9a8 )
2010-01-28T20:31:00.000Z	erUSUL	jenda_	then maybe the hard is busted. or some weird bios setting ?
2010-01-28T20:38:00.000Z	jenda_	erUSUL	as in, the HDD? or the HW, as in the NIC?
2010-01-28T20:38:00.000Z	erUSUL	jenda_	bios settings on the nic
2010-01-28T20:40:00.000Z	jenda_	erUSUL	sounds like something to bug the manufacturer about - I just bought the thing.
2010-01-28T20:41:00.000Z	erUSUL	jenda_	well if it does not work in win7 you can certainly just retrun the Motherboard
2010-01-28T20:42:00.000Z	jenda_	erUSUL	would have to return the machine, as it was bought whole. I'll have to think about whether its worth it :D
2010-01-28T20:42:00.000Z	erUSUL	jenda_	ok;
2010-01-28T20:42:00.000Z	jenda_	erUSUL	thanks for the suggestions.
2010-01-28T20:45:00.000Z	jenda_	erUSUL	One more thing has come to mind. Do you know what ASUS Gate is? Does it mess with BIOS? It boots up before the OS itself, and I might have messed it up (always throws an error instead of booting).
2010-01-28T20:45:00.000Z	erUSUL	jenda_	i know that nforce chipsets have some sort of bios firewall that's why i asked you to check bios settings for the nic
2010-01-28T20:46:00.000Z	erUSUL	jenda_	just like there is bios fakeraid and such
2010-01-28T20:46:00.000Z	jenda_	erUSUL	I'll have a look if Ican't find anything in the BIOS.
