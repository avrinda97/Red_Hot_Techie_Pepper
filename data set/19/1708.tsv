2010-10-25T10:42:00.000Z	MagusOTB	SubCool	try reinstalling KDE, it should at least reset the defaults.
2010-10-25T10:43:00.000Z	SubCool	MagusOTB	howdo i do that? last time i added KDE from scratch, and removed it for that matter, things got really f;ed up
2010-10-25T10:50:00.000Z	SubCool	MagusOTB	anything u can kinda suggest? Im not too sure how i can reinstall KDE, is there a reinstall?
2010-10-25T10:50:00.000Z	MagusOTB	SubCool	use aptitude and delete it and reinstall it? I dunno, you might check if there's a separate channel for kubuntu.
2010-10-25T10:51:00.000Z	SubCool	MagusOTB	i have, no one responses at all
2010-10-25T10:52:00.000Z	MagusOTB	SubCool	hrmm. I haven't used KDE in a really long time, so I can't really suggest anything other than using the command line apt tools to delete it and reinstall it. Sorry :\
2010-10-25T10:54:00.000Z	SubCool	MagusOTB	thats what im about to do here..
2010-10-25T10:58:00.000Z	SubCool	MagusOTB	I wouldnt call it wrapping your head around problems. I do this kinda work for windows, and hardware. Getting wrapped arounda PROGAMMing issue is rediculous. NO one here knows how to fix my issue. I run into this NORMALLY. Either this will just fail, or maybe my Xorg will just crash for no Reason at all, and then i have to somehow fix that, which normally no one knows how to fix, or myself..
2010-10-25T10:58:00.000Z	MagusOTB	SubCool	You deleted ~/.kde. given that you're in a channel full fo people who don't use KDE, our best solution is "delete and reinstall KDE" What do you expect?
2010-10-25T10:59:00.000Z	SubCool	MagusOTB	an intellegent response.
2010-10-25T10:59:00.000Z	MagusOTB	SubCool	Why haven't you reinstalled KDE?
2010-10-25T11:01:00.000Z	MagusOTB	SubCool	Of course it did, it's where KDE stores all your settings...
2010-10-25T11:06:00.000Z	SubCool	MagusOTB	because usually there is a driver, that someone made- but it hasnt spread far enough they, or it needs 3 added patches fore EACH system to work..
