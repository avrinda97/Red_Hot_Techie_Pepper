2008-05-10T09:15:00.000Z	bazhang	olrrai	you trying to install a theme or what
2008-05-10T09:16:00.000Z	olrrai	bazhang	I need to configure themes (I use ubuntu 7.10 amd64)
2008-05-10T09:16:00.000Z	bazhang	olrrai	download them to a  folder and install them that way
2008-05-10T09:17:00.000Z	olrrai	bazhang	I did that, but I also need to change any menu and control colors
2008-05-10T09:18:00.000Z	bazhang	olrrai	does the theme allow that?
2008-05-10T09:18:00.000Z	olrrai	bazhang	nope
2008-05-10T09:19:00.000Z	bazhang	olrrai	you want a total revamp type theme?
2008-05-10T09:21:00.000Z	olrrai	bazhang	no total, only a few things
2008-05-10T09:21:00.000Z	bazhang	olrrai	if you want total there are some fun options
2008-05-10T09:22:00.000Z	olrrai	bazhang	for example?
2008-05-10T09:23:00.000Z	olrrai	bazhang	thanks
2009-07-16T22:34:00.000Z	bazhang	olrrai	which Ubuntu are you on? gnome?
2009-07-16T22:35:00.000Z	olrrai	bazhang	yes, gnome
2009-07-16T22:36:00.000Z	bazhang	olrrai	the exact command is to replace emerald with the gtk window decorator; I have forgotten what it is though; let's go ask in #compiz
2009-07-16T22:36:00.000Z	olrrai	bazhang	ok, thanks!
2009-07-16T22:37:00.000Z	bazhang	olrrai	/join #compiz  (I am there already)
