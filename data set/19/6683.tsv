2007-12-27T18:53:00.000Z	Archie1		is it better to install 7.10 from a cd than to upgrade from 7.4 or is it the same exact thing?
2007-12-27T18:53:00.000Z	Archie1		?
2007-12-27T18:54:00.000Z	Archie1		so yes
2007-12-27T18:54:00.000Z	Archie1		just use vlc
2007-12-27T18:54:00.000Z	Archie1		or mplayer
2007-12-27T18:54:00.000Z	Archie1		mplayer supports everything!
2007-12-27T18:55:00.000Z	Pici	Archie1	Please don't assume like that unless you know what you are talking about.
2007-12-27T18:55:00.000Z	Archie1	Pici	assume what?
2007-12-27T18:56:00.000Z	Pici	Archie1	That since Ubuntu is linux that it supports proprietary codecs.
2007-12-27T18:56:00.000Z	Archie1	Pici	you can install ones even if it doesnt
2007-12-27T18:56:00.000Z	Pici	Archie1	Yes, but he asked about 'out of the box'
2007-12-27T18:57:00.000Z	Pici	Archie1	Its okay :)
2007-12-27T18:58:00.000Z	Archie1	Pici	doesn't totem also provice all the codecs needed?
2007-12-27T18:58:00.000Z	Pici	Archie1	It can, but it needs to install them first.
2007-12-27T18:59:00.000Z	Archie1	Pici	is upgrading from 7.4 just like installing straight from the cd?
2007-12-27T19:00:00.000Z	Pici	Archie1	No, Only the !alternate cd can be used as an upgrade disk, the desktop CD is only for new installs.
2007-12-27T19:01:00.000Z	Archie1	Pici	i am doing it through update manager atm
2007-12-27T19:01:00.000Z	Pici	Archie1	Update manager is fun as well
2007-12-27T19:02:00.000Z	Pici	Archie1	Er, fine (fun too)
