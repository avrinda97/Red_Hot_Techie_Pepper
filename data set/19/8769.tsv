2007-02-10T16:31:00.000Z	atlanta800		anyone on why X wouldn't let you escape to a console?
2007-02-10T16:33:00.000Z	atlanta800		odd
2007-02-10T16:35:00.000Z	atlanta800		I can no longer use Ctrl+Alt+F# to get to a console, any idea why?
2007-02-10T16:37:00.000Z	atlanta800		Can someone please help me out, I can no longer use Ctrl+Alt+F# to get to a console... Ctrl+Alt+Bkspc works, to reboot X...
2007-02-10T16:38:00.000Z	Morrowyn	atlanta800	try booting from grub into the console directly
2007-02-10T16:38:00.000Z	Morrowyn		sda1 iirc
2007-02-10T16:38:00.000Z	Morrowyn		or sda2
2007-02-10T16:38:00.000Z	atlanta800	Morrowyn	well yes I know I can do that, but I need easy access to the console whenever, I don't want to have to boot into it everytime I need it
2007-02-10T16:39:00.000Z	Morrowyn		maybe
2007-02-10T16:39:00.000Z	Morrowyn		go to assceroires -> terminal
2007-02-10T16:39:00.000Z	Morrowyn		in the gnome menu
2007-02-10T16:39:00.000Z	Morrowyn		or do you need need to drop out of X completely
2007-02-10T16:39:00.000Z	atlanta800	Morrowyn	I know of that too, but I used to be able to get to the actual console, I have specific needs to be able to do that
2007-02-10T16:39:00.000Z	Morrowyn		ok
2007-02-10T16:40:00.000Z	atlanta800		the F-key method was working when I installed, and up until just a few days ago, may be because of an update...
2007-02-10T16:40:00.000Z	Morrowyn	atlanta800	could be, i always used the ctrl-alt-f#
2007-02-10T16:41:00.000Z	Morrowyn		for that stuff
2007-02-10T16:41:00.000Z	atlanta800	Morrowyn	I've used it frequently in the past, but I've been tweaking, updating, and trying to get things to work on this system, that I never noticed exactly when it stopped working
2007-02-10T16:44:00.000Z	Morrowyn	atlanta800	maybe check the ubuntu forums , probably some other person on this earth has the same problem you have iwth ubuntu
