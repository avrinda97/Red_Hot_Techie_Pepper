2009-11-05T00:52:00.000Z	knoxville		How do I install a theme? I have some files downloaded in a rar file..
2009-11-05T00:54:00.000Z	knoxville		"114151-Darkside.rar" does not appear to be a valid theme.
2009-11-05T00:56:00.000Z	Colonel_Panik	knoxville	sometimes creators put multiple theme files (like metacity and gtk) into one archved file so check if the theme files are in the archieve by unpacking a copy of the rar in a tmp folder
2009-11-05T00:56:00.000Z	knoxville	Colonel_Panik	Alright! :)
2009-11-05T00:57:00.000Z	knoxville	Colonel_Panik	There is a file called deco_3 (.png files in there) and a file called darkside.qtcurve and darkside.colors

2009-11-05T01:05:00.000Z	Colonel_Panik	knoxville	if the theme is right for your distro put it in a folder named for your theme and put it in /home/you/.themes
2009-11-05T01:06:00.000Z	knoxville	Colonel_Panik	What do you mean by distro?
2009-11-05T01:07:00.000Z	Colonel_Panik	knoxville	if its a wrong theme it won't work but how do you know 'till you try it eh?
2009-11-05T01:07:00.000Z	Colonel_Panik	knoxville	distro is Fedora Ubuntu etc.
2009-11-05T01:08:00.000Z	Colonel_Panik	knoxville	distro/distribution
2009-11-05T01:08:00.000Z	knoxville	Colonel_Panik	Alright.. I'll check it out
2009-11-05T01:12:00.000Z	knoxville	Colonel_Panik	What does it mean by "Kicker"
2009-11-05T01:18:00.000Z	Colonel_Panik	knoxville	kicker is the way the applications or start button presents itself I thinK.
2009-11-05T01:19:00.000Z	knoxville	Colonel_Panik	Okay, a stupid question perhaps.. I skipped the themes I've downloaded so far.. and now i'm on gnome-look.org.. Where is the themes at? GTK 2.x or GDM Themes??
2009-11-05T01:22:00.000Z	Colonel_Panik	knoxville	you need to know what you are running for a window decorator then go to the gtk or metacity themes for desktop themes. gdm is login screens and themes
2009-11-05T01:23:00.000Z	knoxville	Colonel_Panik	I have no clue? I'm running Ubuntu 9.10? and one of their standard themes.
2009-11-05T01:24:00.000Z	Colonel_Panik	knoxville	you need compz  fusion icon to check for what window decorator you are running.
2009-11-05T01:27:00.000Z	Colonel_Panik	knoxville	check synaptic for compiz fusion icon, download, run it and choose window decorator from that menu
