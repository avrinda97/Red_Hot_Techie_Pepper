2010-08-30T00:06:00.000Z	jrib	hoare	they'll probably be restored when you login again or just right click -> create directory yourself...
2010-08-30T00:06:00.000Z	hoare	jrib	their icons do not come back.
2010-08-30T00:07:00.000Z	hoare	jrib	they arent restored upon login

2010-08-30T00:11:00.000Z	hoare	jrib	thanks a lot
2010-10-15T19:15:00.000Z	jrib	hoare	what services do you want to stop?
2010-10-15T19:15:00.000Z	hoare	jrib	mysql proftpd apache21
2010-10-15T19:16:00.000Z	jrib	hoare	if they use upstart, then you won't do it this way (check if there's a file in /etc/init).  If they're still using sysv init scripts, then just use sysv-rc-conf for example
2010-10-15T19:17:00.000Z	hoare	jrib	where is sysv-rc-conf ?
2010-10-15T19:17:00.000Z	hoare	jrib	I can start them manually later. it wont be a problem. just wondering where is the setting.
2010-10-15T19:17:00.000Z	jrib	hoare	you can install it
