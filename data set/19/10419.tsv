2008-04-07T00:45:00.000Z	joel	jrib	it's permissions that's the problem
2008-04-07T00:44:00.000Z	jrib	joel	those options aren't used for ext3
2008-04-07T00:46:00.000Z	jrib	joel	alx75775: you should be able to set permissions with chmod/chown as usual
2008-04-07T00:46:00.000Z	jrib	joel	/media/...
2008-04-07T00:47:00.000Z	joel	jrib	I rarely do it this way so do I just do chmod 777 /media/....
2008-04-07T00:47:00.000Z	jrib	joel	it depends on the permissions you want
2008-04-07T00:49:00.000Z	jrib	joel	then you don't chmod it.  Set a label if you want.  Then it will get assigned the same name every time
2008-04-07T00:50:00.000Z	joel	jrib	how do I set a label?
2008-04-07T00:50:00.000Z	jrib	joel	with mtools, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RenameUSBDrive
2008-04-07T00:59:00.000Z	joel	jrib	can you help me out when you are free?
2008-04-07T01:00:00.000Z	jrib	joel	I can try; what's the issue?
2008-04-07T01:01:00.000Z	jrib	joel	you want umask=000
2008-04-07T01:01:00.000Z	jrib	joel	umask masks permissions (takes them away)
2008-04-07T01:02:00.000Z	jrib	joel	no need to reboot, just remount that partition
2008-04-07T01:11:00.000Z	joel	jrib	that fixed it :) thanks a lot
2008-04-07T01:11:00.000Z	jrib	joel	no problem
2008-04-07T01:11:00.000Z	joel	jrib	one other thing that I'm having is when I delete it says it can't send it to the trash and must immediately delete it
2008-04-07T01:11:00.000Z	jrib	joel	don't know about that
