2008-04-25T13:49:00.000Z	preme	IndyGunFreak	does it works with google mail?
2008-04-25T13:50:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	preme	yes,... quite well actually... ony thing i've found is you have to manually add it to your startup programs so it starts on boot, beyond that though, i love it.. you can delete mails, mark spam, etc, w/o even loggig into your account
2008-04-25T13:52:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	preme	its in the repositories
2008-04-25T13:52:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	preme	system/admin/synaptic
2008-04-25T13:53:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	preme	do a search for checkgmail  it will pop up
2008-04-25T13:53:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	preme	synaptic is generally the way to go...
2008-04-25T13:54:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	preme	just make sure you install checkgmail and not kcheckgmail
2008-04-25T13:55:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	preme	let it install...
2008-04-25T13:56:00.000Z	preme	IndyGunFreak	it's installed
2008-04-25T13:56:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	preme	ok, applications/internet Gmail checker
2008-04-25T13:57:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	preme	you should get a window to configure your gmail account
2008-04-25T13:57:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	preme	once you set it up with your account, you should see an envelope in your taskbar...
2008-04-25T13:58:00.000Z	preme	IndyGunFreak	yes I see it. Cool ubuntu is smooth
2008-04-25T13:58:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	preme	now you need to add checkgmail to your startup programs
2008-04-25T13:58:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	preme	click SYstem/Preferences/Sessions
2008-04-25T13:59:00.000Z	preme	IndyGunFreak	when I take add there it ask for a command. what is the command to start checkgmail?
2008-04-25T14:00:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	preme	this exactly     checkgmail
2008-04-25T14:01:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	preme	i always just put one in the panel
2008-04-25T14:06:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	preme	if you don't use video chat, i'd recommend pidgin..
