2006-06-29T07:34:00.000Z	MattSta		can anyone help me install games
2006-06-29T07:34:00.000Z	cartesian1984	MattSta	What kind of games are we talking about? Native linux, or emulated?
2006-06-29T07:35:00.000Z	cartesian1984	MattSta	Those we'll have to emulate. What kind of video card?
2006-06-29T07:36:00.000Z	cartesian1984	MattSta	I think that's supported by the open source radeon driver, am I right?
2006-06-29T07:37:00.000Z	cartesian1984	MattSta	do you have 3D acceleration? If not we could do a quick test.
2006-06-29T07:37:00.000Z	cartesian1984	MattSta	run glxgears -printfps and see what it says.
2006-06-29T07:38:00.000Z	MattSta	cartesian1984	wow, this is new, i can't acess the terminal
2006-06-29T07:39:00.000Z	cartesian1984	MattSta	ah.......that could be a problem....
2006-06-29T07:39:00.000Z	cartesian1984	MattSta	What does it say?
2006-06-29T07:42:00.000Z	cartesian1984	MattSta	click on the gnome panel, at the top. Right click - add to panel - custom application launcher.
2006-06-29T07:42:00.000Z	cartesian1984	MattSta	and put gnome-terminal in the application bar.
2006-06-29T07:42:00.000Z	MattSta	cartesian1984	could u wait 5 minutes whilest i rest my computer
2006-06-29T07:42:00.000Z	cartesian1984	MattSta	or command.
2006-06-29T07:42:00.000Z	cartesian1984	MattSta	Yeah.
2006-06-29T07:48:00.000Z	cartesian1984	MattSta	Yeah, hang on.
2006-06-29T07:52:00.000Z	cartesian1984	MattSta	its a menu editor
2006-06-29T08:00:00.000Z	cartesian1984	MattSta	Yeah. The games you mentioned earlier were for windows, so they have to be run under cedega or wine. Cedega is better, but it payware. Wine is FOSS.
2006-06-29T08:02:00.000Z	MattSta	cartesian1984	so how do i get through those problems
2006-06-29T08:19:00.000Z	cartesian1984	MattSta	they have a list of supported games at transgaming.org
