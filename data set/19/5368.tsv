2009-07-28T10:12:00.000Z	nanotube	WIGGMPk	if you open the run dialog (alt-f2) and just type in "kismet", it should start....
2009-07-28T10:12:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	nanotube	negative, I dont use gnome-panel, therefore no run dialogs
2009-07-28T10:13:00.000Z	nanotube	WIGGMPk	what /do/ you use?
2009-07-28T10:13:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	nanotube	besides thats not the solution I want.. which is a clickable shortcut.. AWN
2009-07-28T10:14:00.000Z	nanotube	WIGGMPk	in that case, just make the script contain "gnome-terminal -e 'kismet'"
2009-07-28T10:14:00.000Z	nanotube	WIGGMPk	(or use whatever terminal emulator you prefer)
2009-07-28T10:14:00.000Z	nanotube	WIGGMPk	that will open the terminal, and execute the command.
2009-07-28T10:14:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	nanotube	cool... can this be done from alacarte or must it be a script?
2009-07-28T10:15:00.000Z	nanotube	WIGGMPk	since it's a one-liner, i think you can swing it with alacarte...
2009-07-28T10:15:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	nanotube	pog: thanks guys/gals for the help
2009-07-28T10:16:00.000Z	nanotube	WIGGMPk	np :)
2009-07-28T10:18:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	nanotube	works like a charm
2009-07-28T10:22:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	nanotube	sorry to bug you again.. but could you direct me to any good scripting resource sites to read up? I eventually want to try and automate some things for my penetration testing..
2009-07-28T10:22:00.000Z	nanotube	WIGGMPk	google for "advanced bash scripting guide". it's the ultimate scripting reference.
2009-07-28T10:23:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	nanotube	thanks =)
2009-07-28T10:23:00.000Z	nanotube	WIGGMPk	np :)
2009-07-28T10:23:00.000Z	nanotube	WIGGMPk	also, generally, "man somecommand" is a good thing to try on anything :)
2009-07-28T10:24:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	nanotube	yea.. i neglect the manpages resource a lot.. =(
2009-07-28T10:24:00.000Z	nanotube	WIGGMPk	 :)
