2006-03-01T12:15:00.000Z	idefix_		what do you do when you get the feeling you'll never get up to date to the standards of technology?
2006-03-01T12:17:00.000Z	idefix_		how can you find a file somewhere in the file system that contains certain text?
2006-03-01T12:17:00.000Z	kmaynard	idefix_	grep
2006-03-01T12:17:00.000Z	idefix_		so grep "certain text" ?
2006-03-01T12:17:00.000Z	kmaynard		yup
2006-03-01T12:18:00.000Z	kmaynard		if you have no idea where it is, you can try this:  grep -R "some text" /
2006-03-01T12:18:00.000Z	kmaynard		just be prepared to wait :)
2006-03-01T12:18:00.000Z	idefix_	kmaynard	it'll take a long time, won't it?
2006-03-01T12:18:00.000Z	kmaynard	idefix_	yup...try the man page, see if you can exclude directories...im not a grep expert
2006-03-01T12:19:00.000Z	kmaynard		or you can just look in home, var, andetc...where its more likely to be
2006-03-01T12:26:00.000Z	idefix_	kmaynard	how long can it take maximally?
2006-03-01T12:27:00.000Z	kmaynard	idefix_	depends on your box...what are you looking for?
2006-03-01T12:29:00.000Z	idefix_		a file that contains "mijn zooi"
2006-03-01T12:29:00.000Z	idefix_		kmaynard
2006-03-01T12:29:00.000Z	kmaynard	idefix_	ooook...is it an email, a config...? you can narrow down your search likely to etc, home, or var
2006-03-01T12:30:00.000Z	kmaynard		then it wont take so long
2006-03-01T12:31:00.000Z	idefix_	kmaynard	my neighbour used my PC to make it internetaccessible, I saw him type "mijn zooi" in some file and I'd like to know which file it is
2006-03-01T12:50:00.000Z	kmaynard	idefix_	check in /etc
2006-03-01T13:01:00.000Z	idefix_	kmaynard	I can play MP3's so the sound card should be configured in linux, then why doens't it work with the flashplayer? I'll just read the stuff you sent, but I still think it's kinda strange
