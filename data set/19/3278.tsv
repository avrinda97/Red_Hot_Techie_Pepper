2010-01-25T15:45:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	theadmin	highly doubt that will work
2010-01-25T15:48:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	theadmin	either will work I think.. though ntfs-3g is probably better than ntfs itself
2010-01-25T15:49:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	theadmin	mount -t ntfs-3g /dev/<hd> /mnt/some_point
2010-02-28T22:00:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	theadmin	those are low numbered ports, especially assigned by iana
2010-02-28T22:02:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	theadmin	alternative httpd port
2010-02-28T22:03:00.000Z	theadmin	psycho_oreos	Dunno, when i installed mine HTTPD httpd.conf had only 80 there
2010-02-28T22:04:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	theadmin	yeah but like previously mentioned before, port 80 is a privileged/reserved port, only root has that right to run daemons on low port numbers
2010-02-28T22:04:00.000Z	theadmin	psycho_oreos	Well, i just put that in /etc/init.d, so no worries anymore.
2010-02-28T22:05:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	theadmin	yeah and root will start that, therefore it becomes low number
2010-02-28T22:05:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	theadmin	that's to tell the shell interpreter to use a specific shell
2010-02-28T22:06:00.000Z	theadmin	psycho_oreos	What's the default? Although, whatever, i just put "#!/bin/bash"
2010-02-28T22:06:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	theadmin	I don't think there is a default, though if its not defined, it usually goes by /bin/bash
2010-02-28T22:08:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	theadmin	you might want to ask that in #bash
2010-04-07T13:49:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	theadmin	doesn't really matter, its most likely Gnome
2010-04-09T15:00:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	theadmin	its also known as ugo (user, group, others)
2010-04-09T15:00:00.000Z	theadmin	psycho_oreos	chelz: Well, will know
2010-04-09T19:10:00.000Z	theadmin	psycho_oreos	That's not a question even
2010-04-09T19:10:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	theadmin	still classified as repeating :)
2010-04-11T17:36:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	theadmin	dd is mainly to be used on block devices
