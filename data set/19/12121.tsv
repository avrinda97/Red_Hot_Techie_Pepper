2006-04-03T06:34:00.000Z	nathanj	apokryphos	howto?
2006-04-03T06:35:00.000Z	apokryphos	nathanj	Google.
2006-04-03T06:36:00.000Z	nathanj	apokryphos	:o i just want a terminal stuck to my desktop and not able to come above other windows
2006-04-03T06:36:00.000Z	apokryphos	nathanj	yup, just google -- I'm quite sure you can do all that.
2006-04-03T06:37:00.000Z	nathanj	apokryphos	;s
2006-04-03T06:40:00.000Z	nathanj	apokryphos	no luck
2006-04-03T06:41:00.000Z	apokryphos	nathanj	actually, I think it's even all in the man page
2006-04-03T06:42:00.000Z	apokryphos	nathanj	though Google brings up *loads* of links with easy walkthroughs... not sure how you didn't have luck with those.
2006-04-03T06:42:00.000Z	nathanj	apokryphos	what you searching :s
2006-04-03T06:43:00.000Z	nathanj	apokryphos	thats not what im looking for i wnt it "stuck" to my desktop
2006-04-03T06:44:00.000Z	apokryphos	nathanj	that's not all you said. You said borderless etc.. but anyhow, it being "stuck" to the desktop is an issue of the window manager. On KDE you can just alt+f3 on a window and set that from there
2006-04-03T06:44:00.000Z	nathanj	apokryphos	yeah i basically want console text on my desktop
2006-04-03T06:45:00.000Z	apokryphos	nathanj	well that guide describes how to make it transparent and borderless
2006-04-03T06:45:00.000Z	nathanj	apokryphos	yeah the question is pinning it :D
2006-04-03T06:46:00.000Z	apokryphos	nathanj	which is handled by the window manager, as I said. Not running gnome so can't check for sure, but perhaps try clicking the icon on the very top-left of the window (normally  next to File, Edit etc)
2006-04-03T06:46:00.000Z	nathanj	apokryphos	i got the terminal up and running but i cant position it correctly for some reason i set the geomotery but i doesnt comply
