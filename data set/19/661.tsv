2011-10-31T20:01:00.000Z	amee2k		even between consecutive versions of the same distro
2011-10-31T20:01:00.000Z	amee2k		unless you habitually recompile the kernel after installing a distro anyway
2011-10-31T20:02:00.000Z	amee2k		chances are one is in the default install, but i haven't found it yet
2011-10-31T20:03:00.000Z	amee2k		other than the control panel and libreoffice i haven't found anything yet
2011-10-31T20:04:00.000Z	amee2k		and how do i fix that icon bar thing on the left when it disappears >-<
2011-10-31T20:05:00.000Z	amee2k		>_< even
2011-10-31T20:06:00.000Z	amee2k		um... stupid question, btu how do i un-maximize a window? the titel bar is gone
2011-10-31T20:06:00.000Z	s0nee	amee2k	press ctrl space to open the menu
2011-10-31T20:07:00.000Z	amee2k	s0nee	its a terminal window. there is nothing to focus that won't take the keyboard input for itself
2011-10-31T20:07:00.000Z	s0nee	amee2k	wait maybe i changed it ... open "gnome-control-center keyboard" to see the shortcut
2011-10-31T20:08:00.000Z	amee2k	s0nee	its not gnome, its the ghetto DE that comes with ubuntu by default now
2011-10-31T20:09:00.000Z	s0nee	amee2k	its keyboard, not keyboard layout
2011-10-31T20:10:00.000Z	s0nee	amee2k	click on "shortcuts" tab, look under "windows"
2011-10-31T20:13:00.000Z	s0nee	amee2k	whats ghetto DE ? ive never heard of it
2011-10-31T20:14:00.000Z	amee2k	s0nee	i mean the one that comes with a stock 11.10 install
2011-10-31T20:14:00.000Z	s0nee	amee2k	unity you mean
2011-10-31T20:20:00.000Z	amee2k	s0nee	is there some kind of primer to read on all the little tricks like the alt-space thing for unminimizing windows?
2011-10-31T20:23:00.000Z	s0nee	amee2k	idk. i read from various articles and wikis ..
