2007-01-13T14:55:00.000Z	Jowi	threeonefour	what type of OS is that other OS?
2007-01-13T14:56:00.000Z	threeonefour	Jowi	linux man  i don't like to talk about M$    i had a bad experiance
2007-01-13T14:57:00.000Z	Jowi	threeonefour	sure. 1st of all, find out which HDD and partition it resides on. then check where and the name of the kernel you wish to boot. get back to me when you're set
2007-01-13T14:58:00.000Z	threeonefour	Jowi	how do i check the kernel info
2007-01-13T14:59:00.000Z	Jowi	threeonefour	if you know which partition and harddisk your other linux system is installed on - mount it and cd to it. the kernel should be in the /boot directory
2007-01-13T14:59:00.000Z	Jowi	threeonefour	the name is probably vmlinuz-something
2007-01-13T15:01:00.000Z	threeonefour	Jowi	yep 2.6.9
2007-01-13T15:01:00.000Z	Jowi	threeonefour	need the name of the partition it is on (for example hda3 or sdb2 or something similar) and the full name of the kernel
2007-01-13T15:02:00.000Z	threeonefour	Jowi	go to threeonefour
2007-01-13T15:26:00.000Z	Jowi	threeonefour	success?
2007-01-13T15:26:00.000Z	threeonefour	Jowi	it booted  but then x crashed and i have to reinstall
2007-01-13T15:26:00.000Z	Jowi	threeonefour	that's good. so grub is set up ok.
