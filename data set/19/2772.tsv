2010-01-11T08:54:00.000Z	Planetary_	edbian	well mine isnt
2010-01-11T08:54:00.000Z	edbian	Planetary_	Be more specific
2010-01-11T08:54:00.000Z	edbian	Planetary_	It works as one user, you switch users and it doesn't work?
2010-01-11T08:55:00.000Z	edbian	Planetary_	It says "only 1 user can use it at a time" ???
2010-01-11T08:57:00.000Z	edbian	Planetary_	Can the first user to log in use effects regardless of which user?
2010-01-11T08:58:00.000Z	edbian	Planetary_	Or is it only 1 specific user that can use effects and the other can't regardless of who logged in first
2010-01-11T08:59:00.000Z	edbian	Planetary_	Are you logging out or switching user?
2010-01-11T09:00:00.000Z	Planetary_	edbian	switching users

2010-01-11T09:00:00.000Z	edbian	Planetary_	logging out normally and then logging back in does work?  Is there any way to get the other user to use desktop effects after the first one has besides rebooting the entire machine?
