2007-06-17T10:30:00.000Z	HorizonXP	Gnea	Sorry, i didn't think it'd be so big
2007-06-17T10:31:00.000Z	HorizonXP	Gnea	I would've used Pastebin otherwise
2007-06-17T10:31:00.000Z	Gnea	HorizonXP	it's not too late.
2008-02-08T22:30:00.000Z	Gnea	HorizonXP	what yellow annotations?
2008-02-08T22:30:00.000Z	HorizonXP	Gnea	my prof mark an assignment, and I see these yellow bubble icons, where he probably made comments
2008-02-08T22:31:00.000Z	HorizonXP	Gnea	He probably has adobe acrobat or something; i see these icons in evince, but I can't see the text that's inside them
2008-02-08T22:31:00.000Z	HorizonXP	Gnea	I think in Adobe Reader, clicking them opens a post-it note type deal
2008-02-08T22:34:00.000Z	Gnea	HorizonXP	you can install acroread from medibuntu, iirc
2008-02-08T22:35:00.000Z	Gnea	HorizonXP	there is a license difference.  the only failure is yours in that you don't understand that and that you're jumping to false conclusions.
2008-02-08T22:36:00.000Z	Gnea	HorizonXP	too bad, i offered you a solution. take it or leave it.
2008-02-08T22:36:00.000Z	Gnea	HorizonXP	if it gets the job done, then don't complain.
2008-02-08T22:37:00.000Z	HorizonXP	Gnea	I can and will :)
2008-02-08T22:38:00.000Z	Gnea	HorizonXP	it's your fault that you chose to use a free application to view a non-free/proprietary PDF.
2008-02-08T22:38:00.000Z	HorizonXP	Gnea	how's it my fault? Evince worked beautifully up until now
2008-02-08T22:39:00.000Z	Gnea	HorizonXP	you and I are done now.
2008-02-08T22:39:00.000Z	HorizonXP	Gnea	ok Gnea. I do thank you for your help :)
2008-02-08T22:39:00.000Z	Gnea	HorizonXP	you're welcome.
