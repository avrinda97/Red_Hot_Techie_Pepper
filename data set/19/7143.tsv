2007-10-02T09:00:00.000Z	sitaram		does anyone know if there is a way to get the entire install DVD but in CD-sized chunks for people who don't have or can't use a DVD-writer? quick hints or pointers appreciated!
2007-10-02T09:00:00.000Z	Tomcat_	sitaram	What's the point? Just use the CD then. ;)
2007-10-02T09:01:00.000Z	Tomcat_	sitaram	If you need additional packages and the machines don't have net access, there are ways around that.
2007-10-02T09:01:00.000Z	sitaram	Tomcat_	the thing is, I want to take pretty much the whole darn DVD to my dad's PC, but he has no connectivity, and no DVD-reader :-)
2007-10-02T09:02:00.000Z	sitaram	Tomcat_	"take...to my dad's PC" is a one-night train trip away -- hence the need to take everything I can i one shot!
2007-10-02T09:02:00.000Z	Tomcat_	sitaram	I wouldn't know any way... but synaptic can create scripts to download packages on a different PC.
2007-10-02T09:02:00.000Z	Tomcat_	sitaram	Oh, all right...
2007-10-02T09:02:00.000Z	Tomcat_	sitaram	Is there an OS on the PC?
2007-10-02T09:03:00.000Z	sitaram	Tomcat_	yes, right now Mandriva
2007-10-02T09:04:00.000Z	Tomcat_	sitaram	In that case, use the "split" command to split the DVD into many chunks, transport them over on CDs, re-assemble them... and then mount it via loopback (so you don't need a DVD at all)
2007-10-02T09:05:00.000Z	sitaram	Tomcat_	thanks -- that sounds like it would work, I think dad has enough plenty free disk anyway
2007-10-02T09:06:00.000Z	Tomcat_	sitaram	Problem is that when you install Ubuntu this way you'd still need an install CD and a partition on *some* hard drive for the DVD image.
2007-10-02T09:06:00.000Z	Tomcat_	sitaram	But I can't think of another way.
2007-10-02T09:06:00.000Z	sitaram	Tomcat_	thats OK I can take an install CD along...
2007-10-02T09:07:00.000Z	sitaram	Tomcat_	some time ago, when I was still on Mandriva, I know they had a set of 5 or 6 CD images, and you could concatenate them to make a DVD image!  Separately they would be CD's, combined, one dvd -- sounded awesome (and unbelievable)
2007-10-02T09:08:00.000Z	Tomcat_	sitaram	Might be possible. :)
2007-10-02T09:08:00.000Z	sitaram	Tomcat_	yeah, I guess I was hoping :-)  Anyway your idea is probably the easiest for me in the time I have before my trip.
2007-10-02T09:08:00.000Z	sitaram	Tomcat_	thanks...
2007-10-02T09:09:00.000Z	Tomcat_	sitaram	Always. ;)
