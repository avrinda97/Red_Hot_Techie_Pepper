2010-09-02T19:08:00.000Z	veovis_muaddib		I'm using 10.04, is there any way, with a samba share mounted to, say ~/Videos, to keep the folder semi synchronized?  That is to say, that every time a file is accessed in the server's Videos folder, it is saved in the local machine's Videos folder with the same path, until a size threshold is reached, at which point the files with the oldest last accessed times get deleted?
2010-09-02T19:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	veovis_muaddib	if the samba is mounter to ~/Videos then the file on the server and local system will be the same
2010-09-02T19:09:00.000Z	veovis_muaddib	ActionParsnip	Yeah, until the user leaves the  local network
2010-09-02T19:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	veovis_muaddib	then instead use rsync between so that the system can retain a local copy
2010-09-02T19:11:00.000Z	veovis_muaddib	ActionParsnip	rsync will allow for syncronization of only the files that get accessed regularly?  My mother's hard drive is rather small, so I can't just sync the whole folder, but if she is at home, she needs the whole folder to be accessable
2010-09-02T19:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	veovis_muaddib	it will only upload the newer changed files
2010-09-02T19:12:00.000Z	veovis_muaddib	ActionParsnip	So I can syncronize a ~750 GB folder onto her 250 GB hard drive and only have it sync the files she has recently accessed?
2010-09-02T19:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	veovis_muaddib	no as you will attempt to put 750b on her storage which won't fit
2010-09-02T19:14:00.000Z	veovis_muaddib	ActionParsnip	Then that's not what I'm after
2010-09-02T19:14:00.000Z	veovis_muaddib	ActionParsnip	Thank you though
2010-09-02T19:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	veovis_muaddib	she will need to copy the files she needs, then sync the files. If its over WWW you can use sshfs
2011-10-20T02:37:00.000Z	veovis_muaddib	ActionParsnip	After upgrading to 11.10:  The login screen shows up, but upon attempted login, shows a probably 320x480 or so virtual terminal.  Session was set to gnome or unity or whatever it was called, and control-alt-F* blanked the screen.  So I reinstalled, and now there isn't even a login screen.
2011-10-20T02:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	veovis_muaddib	are you using a virtual system?
2011-10-20T02:38:00.000Z	veovis_muaddib	ActionParsnip	Nope, real hardware
2011-10-20T02:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	veovis_muaddib	what GPU do you use
2011-10-20T02:42:00.000Z	veovis_muaddib	ActionParsnip	nvidia onboard something, I'll see if it says on the motherboard
2011-10-20T02:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	veovis_muaddib	use the boot option:  nouveau.blacklist=1
2011-10-20T02:43:00.000Z	veovis_muaddib	ActionParsnip	Can I set that from a live USB?
2011-10-20T02:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	veovis_muaddib	yes
