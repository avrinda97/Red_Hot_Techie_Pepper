2007-01-06T09:03:00.000Z	bulmer	jonf	is eth0 mapped to your wifi or is that a separate nic card ?

2007-01-06T09:04:00.000Z	bulmer	jonf	easy to verify...iwconfig eth0

2007-01-06T09:05:00.000Z	bulmer	jonf	is there a light indicator on your embedded wifi card that tells you it is active?
2007-01-06T09:05:00.000Z	jonf	bulmer	yes, but the light is off
2007-01-06T09:05:00.000Z	bulmer	jonf	look around for a switch to turn in on...or keyboard combo perhaps..
2007-01-06T09:06:00.000Z	jonf	bulmer	 I just push the button, but is not switching
2007-01-06T09:06:00.000Z	bulmer	jonf	next is check with   dmesg|grep eth0
2007-01-06T09:07:00.000Z	jonf	bulmer	 but I cant switch the light on
2007-01-06T09:07:00.000Z	bulmer	jonf	oh there is a switch, you may need to pull out your handy manual and read it..lolz
2007-01-06T09:08:00.000Z	jonf	bulmer	 but when I work with windows, I just push the switch
2007-01-06T09:09:00.000Z	bulmer	jonf	see the dmesg if it detected it..
