2005-09-18T16:24:00.000Z	F_for_Fragging		I installed bittorrent-gui, but it doesn't have a menu entry and it doesn't start from the terminal either. I'm using the Breezy preview, anyone else having this problem?
2005-09-18T16:25:00.000Z	deFrysk	F_for_Fragging	yust use gnome-bitorrent ;)
2005-09-18T16:25:00.000Z	deFrysk	F_for_Fragging	its in the menu under internet
2005-09-18T16:26:00.000Z	F_for_Fragging	deFrysk	I know that gnome-bittorrent is installed by default, but it lacks features, it doesn't let me cap the download and it doesn't let me select the port which bittorrent should use
2005-09-18T16:27:00.000Z	deFrysk	F_for_Fragging	ok
2005-09-18T16:28:00.000Z	deFrysk	F_for_Fragging	if you hit bt <tab> <tab> you have all the bt executables to look at
2005-09-18T16:31:00.000Z	F_for_Fragging	deFrysk	thank you. Just tried that, but the right executable doesn't seem to be installed
2005-09-18T16:31:00.000Z	deFrysk	F_for_Fragging	btdownloadgui <arguments>
2005-09-18T16:31:00.000Z	deFrysk	F_for_Fragging	btdownloadgui <arguments> <url>
2005-09-18T16:32:00.000Z	F_for_Fragging	deFrysk	thank you. But there is no graphical frontend to bittorrent which I can start? It only works from the terminal?
2005-09-18T16:33:00.000Z	deFrysk	F_for_Fragging	alt-f2 and hit your desired command
2005-09-18T16:35:00.000Z	F_for_Fragging	deFrysk	thanks for your help, but if both bittorrent-gui and gnome-bittorrent don't work for me, I think I'll go back to Azureus
2005-09-18T16:36:00.000Z	deFrysk	F_for_Fragging	if you have a fast pc , why not ?
2005-09-18T16:37:00.000Z	F_for_Fragging	deFrysk	my PC can handle Azureus, but I don't like it because it suffers from bloat and featuritis, unfortunately it's my only choice since Azureus has decent UPnP functionality
2005-09-18T16:38:00.000Z	deFrysk	F_for_Fragging	I agree for some part
2005-09-18T16:42:00.000Z	deFrysk	F_for_Fragging	without open source torrents would have never existed dont forget that ;)
2005-09-18T16:49:00.000Z	deFrysk	F_for_Fragging	btw , azureus can be easily locally installed, no deb needed
2005-09-18T16:50:00.000Z	F_for_Fragging	deFrysk	I know, but I'd like to use the repositories
2005-09-18T16:50:00.000Z	deFrysk	F_for_Fragging	stay out of ubuntuguid btw
