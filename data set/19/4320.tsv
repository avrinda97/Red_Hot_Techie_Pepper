2009-04-19T22:20:00.000Z	Barridus		can someone explain what a symlink is in this advice i found?  "i created a script named it "S38umount-cifs" and placed it in /etc/init.d/ with a symlink in /etc/rc6.d/ and that works just great."
2009-04-19T22:21:00.000Z	hbekel	Barridus	man ln
2009-04-19T22:21:00.000Z	Barridus	hbekel	?
2009-04-19T22:21:00.000Z	hbekel	Barridus	read the manpage for the 'ln' command by typing 'man ln' in a terminal
2009-04-19T22:23:00.000Z	hbekel	Barridus	symlink is a symbolic link, that is a "file that points to another file"
2009-04-19T22:26:00.000Z	Barridus	hbekel	ok starting to understand.  perhaps that snipped of advice i c/p'ed does not contail all the info i need.
2009-04-19T22:27:00.000Z	Barridus	hbekel	oh wait.  the snippet was "and named it "S38umount-cifs" and placed it in /etc/init.d/ with a symlink in /etc/rc6.d/ and that works just great."  should i create a dummy file symlinked to this umount-cfs script?
2009-04-19T22:29:00.000Z	hbekel	Barridus	from that snipped i conclude that someone wanted to umount a cifs at shutdown, so he created a script in /etc/init.d and made a link to /etc/rc6.d to make the sysvinit init system run it at shutdown
2009-04-19T22:29:00.000Z	hbekel	Barridus	what is it you want to do, anyways?
2009-04-19T22:29:00.000Z	Barridus	hbekel	exactly what you guesse
2009-04-19T22:32:00.000Z	hbekel	Barridus	so what's your problem, then?
2009-04-19T22:32:00.000Z	Barridus	hbekel	my network processes are terminated on shutdown before shares umounted.  so yes.  i just want to be sure i am understanding which direction i am symlinking this.  so i create a script whatever.sh and put it in /etc/init.d/, then create a 2nd file in /etc/rc6.d/ and symlink to the file in init.d?  or the reverse?
2009-04-19T22:34:00.000Z	hbekel	Barridus	cd /etc/rc6.d; ln -s ../init.d/whatever.sh number-whatever.sh
2009-04-19T22:35:00.000Z	hbekel	Barridus	the numbers of the symlinks in /etc/rc6.d determine the order in which the scripts are called
2009-04-19T22:36:00.000Z	Barridus	hbekel	ok that's golden info.  definitely some of the context i was missing
2009-04-19T22:37:00.000Z	hbekel	Barridus	np. i think you need to chmod +x the script in /etc/init.d, but i'm not sure, it's been a while since i've used a sysv init system. just look around and see how it's done for the other scripts there
2009-04-19T22:39:00.000Z	Barridus	hbekel	yeah i figued that.  thanks a ton i learned quite a bit.  and i can see that umountfs is s40 and networking terminate s35
2009-04-19T23:17:00.000Z	hbekel	Barridus	i'm not on ubuntu right know, maybe this helps: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/InitScriptList
2009-04-19T23:21:00.000Z	Barridus	hbekel	hmm, looks useful for perhaps future reference, but it doesn't specifically say any of them are for shutting down networking
