2007-01-05T14:14:00.000Z	cyphase		Is it legal to install w32codecs for someone who has a Windows license?
2007-01-05T14:14:00.000Z	cyphase		In the US
2007-01-05T14:14:00.000Z	h3xis	cyphase	it's illegal to use w32codecs in the us regardless
2007-01-05T14:14:00.000Z	h3xis	cyphase	but use it anyway.
2007-01-05T14:15:00.000Z	cyphase	h3xis	i'm trying to get my dad, who has a computer shop, to start offering ubuntu
2007-01-05T14:15:00.000Z	cyphase	h3xis	so i'm trying to figure out how to get the most multimedia support legally for his customers
2007-01-05T14:15:00.000Z	h3xis	cyphase	not going to happen
2007-01-05T14:15:00.000Z	h3xis	cyphase	dont try to be "the good guy" and go by the MPAA's laws.
2007-01-05T14:16:00.000Z	h3xis	cyphase	if you want a good system, use it
2007-01-05T14:16:00.000Z	cyphase	h3xis	i'm not talking about me. i've got all the codecs installed
2007-01-05T14:16:00.000Z	h3xis	cyphase	i know
2007-01-05T14:16:00.000Z	h3xis	cyphase	nobody will know they have it. it's not like theyre going to get tasered and throwin into jail for having w32codecs installed
2007-01-05T14:17:00.000Z	cyphase	h3xis	i agree but he doesn't want to take the chance
2007-01-05T14:17:00.000Z	h3xis	cyphase	there's a 0% chance it will happen.
2007-01-05T14:18:00.000Z	h3xis	cyphase	there is no other way
2007-01-05T14:18:00.000Z	h3xis	cyphase	it's stupid to not install them
2007-01-05T14:18:00.000Z	cyphase	h3xis	maybe you should talk to him. please, please talk to him
