2005-10-02T05:38:00.000Z	thoreauputic	someuser	the option you want is currently missing on Ubuntu live CDs
2005-10-02T05:40:00.000Z	thoreauputic	someuser	"takes over" ? What do you mean? grub gives a choice of OS...
2005-10-02T05:41:00.000Z	thoreauputic	someuser	there is, but why?
2005-10-02T05:41:00.000Z	thoreauputic	someuser	grub is much easier to install and use, and more powerful
2005-10-02T05:43:00.000Z	thoreauputic	someuser	this sounds like a personal problem of yours - I suggest counselling *grin*
2005-10-02T05:44:00.000Z	thoreauputic	someuser	but seriously, if you want to do that , google "windows ntloader linux" or similar
2005-10-02T05:48:00.000Z	thoreauputic	someuser	http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&q=windows+ntloader+linux&btnG=Google+Search&meta=
2005-10-02T05:50:00.000Z	thoreauputic	someuser	I gave you a whole page of google links on this subject
2005-10-02T05:51:00.000Z	thoreauputic	someuser	questions about the windows bootloader are kind of off-topic here
