2007-12-08T12:34:00.000Z	bluefoxx		ok, so im still trying to install libdvdcss2 but this is what i get now
2007-12-08T12:34:00.000Z	bluefoxx		  libdvdcss2: Depends: libc6 (>= 2.6-1) but 2.5-0ubuntu14 is to be installed
2007-12-08T12:34:00.000Z	bluefoxx		i was also wondering, how do i make my own channels?
2007-12-08T12:35:00.000Z	wols_	bluefoxx	download your libdvdcss for your feisty or update to gutsy
2007-12-08T12:37:00.000Z	bluefoxx	wols_	i would, but i have no media to backup with, unless i can have it copy all my users accounts, and even then, i dont hacve any blank cds, and my free cd requests are being denied now
2007-12-08T12:38:00.000Z	bluefoxx	wols_	is there a way for me to import user accounts when reinstalling?
2007-12-08T12:38:00.000Z	wols_	bluefoxx	you don't reinstal. you UPGRADE
2007-12-08T12:39:00.000Z	wols_	bluefoxx	no CD necessary either
2007-12-08T12:41:00.000Z	bluefoxx	wols_	i have done that upgrade before, but the side affect was [this was going from 6.10 to 7.04] that the main boot kernel was fried, and hung trying to mount file system, therefore, i prefer a clean install, importing accounts if at all possible
2007-12-08T12:59:00.000Z	wols_	bluefoxx	it means you download from the wrong repo
2007-12-08T12:59:00.000Z	wols_	bluefoxx	download the package from a feisty repo not a gutsy one
2007-12-08T13:00:00.000Z	wols_	bluefoxx	you've been told how to get the proper one
2007-12-08T13:01:00.000Z	wols_	bluefoxx	apt-cache policy libdvdcss2
2007-12-08T14:58:00.000Z	wols_	bluefoxx	no hdd and boot from disk is contradictory
2007-12-08T14:58:00.000Z	bluefoxx	wols_	i meant boot from cd type disk, i use "disk" as slang for "cd"  alot, my bad
2007-12-08T14:59:00.000Z	wols_	bluefoxx	and what about networking there?
2007-12-08T15:00:00.000Z	bluefoxx	wols_	cat6 standard networking cable, using crossover wireing
2007-12-08T15:00:00.000Z	wols_	bluefoxx	that's not ubuntu related. that's ahrdware
2007-12-08T15:02:00.000Z	bluefoxx	wols_	ok, well are there any tutorials for it, im going to bed shortly
