2005-09-24T15:56:00.000Z	Kalidarn		can i use old backports for hoary on breezy preview?
2005-09-24T15:56:00.000Z	johndarkhorse	Kalidarn	backports ARE the same versions as are in breezy
2005-09-24T15:56:00.000Z	Kalidarn		ah perfect.
2005-09-24T15:56:00.000Z	johndarkhorse	Kalidarn	BACKports (from breezy)
2005-09-24T15:57:00.000Z	Kalidarn		hmm then where would Azureus be stored, it was on hoary im pretty sure. not in the breezy repo though
2005-09-24T15:57:00.000Z	johndarkhorse		!info azureus
2005-09-24T15:57:00.000Z	Kalidarn		installing the package is a pain in the arse ;)
2005-09-24T15:57:00.000Z	Kalidarn		!info azureus
2005-09-24T15:58:00.000Z	Kalidarn		!info azureus
2005-09-24T15:58:00.000Z	Kalidarn		lol i could have been told that from http://packages.ubuntu.com/
2005-09-24T15:59:00.000Z	Kalidarn		it was in the old repository though "apparently" and i know for a fact its in the debian one
2005-09-24T15:59:00.000Z	johndarkhorse	Kalidarn	just d/l it from azureus.sourceforge.net
2005-09-24T16:00:00.000Z	Kalidarn	johndarkhorse	done but it aint working and thats why i attempted this method ;) or attempted to find out why.
2005-09-24T16:00:00.000Z	johndarkhorse	Kalidarn	is it a java problem?
2005-09-24T16:00:00.000Z	johndarkhorse	Kalidarn	java is evil
2005-09-24T16:01:00.000Z	Kalidarn		yes and i have set up java properly symbolic links etc works in firefox ;)
2005-09-24T16:01:00.000Z	johndarkhorse	Kalidarn	do other java apps work? (not java plugins for browsers)
2005-09-24T16:02:00.000Z	Kalidarn		unfortuantly the Azureus team decided to stray away from the standard DHT networks that the other clients were using and make their own, if the tracker uses the "azureus one" i can only connect to it from azureus
2005-09-24T16:02:00.000Z	Kalidarn	johndarkhorse	havnt tried any :) havnt got any installed lol
