2007-06-18T15:35:00.000Z	th1	RAH66	if you can use Gimp instead of photoshop it is easier for you. But it is possible to run the Adobe apps inside of Linux, see here: http://blog.publicidadpixelada.com/how-to-adobe-photoshop-cs2-on-ubuntu-10-steps/
2007-06-18T15:36:00.000Z	th1	RAH66	I have used both Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign on linux.
2007-06-18T15:36:00.000Z	th1	RAH66	yes I think it will
2007-06-18T15:50:00.000Z	th1	RAH66	you have to decide if you want to keep XP or just want to have Ubuntu but generally yes
2007-06-18T15:50:00.000Z	th1	RAH66	if you keep XP as well you can still access your files and stuff from inside Ubuntu if that is what you mean
2007-06-18T15:51:00.000Z	th1	RAH66	yes it will, but it needs a separate partition. but the installer can take care of that for you.
2007-06-18T15:53:00.000Z	th1	RAH66	it's not but it is great if you just want to try ubuntu without changing your setup :)
2007-06-18T16:11:00.000Z	th1	RAH66	depends on the type of raid but most likely yes!
2007-06-18T16:12:00.000Z	th1	RAH66	what kind of raid do you have?
