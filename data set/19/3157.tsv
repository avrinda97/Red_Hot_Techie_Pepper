2009-10-16T04:10:00.000Z	BoxMagnet		Can anyone tell me why i must use sudo su to echo -n 95 > /proc/acpi/video/GFX0/DD03/brightness
2009-10-16T04:10:00.000Z	BoxMagnet		sudo does not work nor, sudo -s
2009-10-16T04:10:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	BoxMagnet	your sending a setting to proc - basically direct HW access!  this is root's domain.
2009-10-16T04:12:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	BoxMagnet	what are you trying to do!?!?  strange to be sending "-n 95" to a video card?!?!
2009-10-16T04:12:00.000Z	BoxMagnet	ZykoticK9	lol, its screen brightness
2009-10-16T04:13:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	BoxMagnet	but "-n 95" are you SURE that's the command!
2009-10-16T04:13:00.000Z	BoxMagnet	ZykoticK9	it works
2009-10-20T21:06:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	BoxMagnet	look into copying with recursive feature enabled.  mv does this automatically but copy (cp) does not - if that's what command you're using.  good luck.
2009-10-20T21:07:00.000Z	BoxMagnet	ZykoticK9	no its, simple backup suite, a gui for sbackup
2009-10-20T21:07:00.000Z	BoxMagnet	ZykoticK9	it has a list of packages, but why not just copy the /usr/bin/files
2009-10-20T21:08:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	BoxMagnet	sorry don't know anything about sbackup - though you'd written a simple script for backup and cp might have been giving you troubles.  hope someone else knows.
2009-10-20T21:09:00.000Z	BoxMagnet	ZykoticK9	i might be writing one soon......
2009-10-20T21:10:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	BoxMagnet	typically /usr/bin (and /usr/local/bin/ ) aren't high priorities for backup for me personally - i'm more interested in the packages then the binaries themselves.  best of luck.
2009-10-20T21:10:00.000Z	BoxMagnet	ZykoticK9	will the packages run without the binaries !?
2009-10-20T21:10:00.000Z	BoxMagnet	ZykoticK9	am i missing something
2009-10-20T21:11:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	BoxMagnet	if you have a DEB for a program (that's something i personally backup)
2009-10-20T21:13:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	BoxMagnet	backup the source code then the tar.gz file - keep that
2009-10-20T21:14:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	BoxMagnet	and any config files from that program
2009-10-20T21:20:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	BoxMagnet	see #ubuntu-server -- but ya - i run most of my server vm's in 8g
