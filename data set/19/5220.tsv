2008-09-24T22:02:00.000Z	AlexC		I am trying to run or install Ubuntu 8.04 on a Dell Power Edge SC1430 and it is booting into busybox.
2008-09-24T22:03:00.000Z	AlexC		What can I do?
2008-09-24T22:03:00.000Z	carandraug	AlexC	have you tried alternate CD? You checked the cd for defects?
2008-09-24T22:05:00.000Z	AlexC	carandraug	= Do you have reason to believe Ubuntu 8.04 should work on ths machine?
2008-09-24T22:07:00.000Z	carandraug	AlexC	I don't have any reason to believe it shouldn't work.
2008-09-24T22:08:00.000Z	carandraug	AlexC	think I've found it http://doubleclix.wordpress.com/2007/10/26/ubuntu-710-2-x-quadcore-dell-poweredge-sc1430/
2008-09-24T22:08:00.000Z	AlexC	carandraug	- I tried booting from a new 7.04 CD and got thrown into busybox as well.
2008-09-24T22:13:00.000Z	carandraug	AlexC	the page I sent you seemed to have some problems with 7.10 but it says how he solved it. I never uses raid so I can't help you there
2008-09-24T23:16:00.000Z	carandraug	AlexC	if you think it's a hardware issue, try disconnect as much as you can before booting from LiveCD. You mentioned your HDD before. Try booting LiveCD without HDD. At least that way you'll find where the problem is
2008-09-24T23:17:00.000Z	AlexC	carandraug	- I wanted to see of Red Hat Enterprise Linux would boot and install. It did and it is installing. I would think that If I can run Red Hat then Ubuntu would be no problem.
2008-09-24T23:22:00.000Z	carandraug	AlexC	those assumptions are wrong. I, for example, can install pclos in one computer I have at home and not Ubuntu due to HDD issues. I can boot into liveCD only if I remove the HDD
2008-09-24T23:23:00.000Z	carandraug	AlexC	I meant the first assumption you made, not the second. It means something wrong but I don't know if there's a file to check it
2008-09-24T23:24:00.000Z	carandraug	AlexC	I recommend to disconnect as much as you can and then connect them back, one at a time until you find the origin of the problem.
2008-09-24T23:25:00.000Z	carandraug	AlexC	that's how I found the problem was on the HDD with my other computer. And then, I tried to switch the cables and use a different port to make sure wheter the problem was on the disk or somewhere in the connection
2008-09-24T23:29:00.000Z	carandraug	AlexC	but before you start dismantling your PC, have you tried the alternate CD install yet? That would be my first recommendation
2008-09-25T00:03:00.000Z	carandraug	AlexC	I was away. Have you tried disconnecting the floppy disk drive too?
2008-09-25T00:07:00.000Z	AlexC	carandraug	- No I did not try that. I am downloading the ubuntu iso now. I am going to attempt to create the CD with speed set to 8 and see if that works better.
2008-09-25T00:08:00.000Z	carandraug	AlexC	if you're downloading another iso now, download the alternateCD iso instead
2008-09-25T00:09:00.000Z	carandraug	AlexC	also, didn't you said you used that CD to install Ubuntu into another computer? You can check for defects when it boots from CD.
