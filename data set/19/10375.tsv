2006-07-26T09:53:00.000Z	a2xm		hi all, can I just boot using win xp installer CD and type "fdisk /mbr" to delete the GRUB and then reinstall ubuntu for fixing my broken GRUB?
2006-07-26T09:53:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	a2xm	or you can try the Super Grub Repaid CD
2006-07-26T09:54:00.000Z	a2xm	Jack_Sparrow	what's that?
2006-07-26T09:55:00.000Z	a2xm	Jack_Sparrow	where I can get it?
2006-07-26T09:56:00.000Z	a2xm	Jack_Sparrow	if I delete mbr and reinstall ubuntu, it will make a new grub right? and my win xp will be ok too?
