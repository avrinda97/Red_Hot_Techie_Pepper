2005-09-25T06:08:00.000Z	robzon		and there is a very bad dependency error in nvidia-glx-legacy package
2005-09-25T06:10:00.000Z	rukuartic	robzon	so to add myself, do I just add a shortcut to /usr/myusername ? or edit a text file?
2005-09-25T06:10:00.000Z	robzon	rukuartic	you have to be added to /etc/sudoers then you use your user password, but only allowed users may use it, so it's ok
2005-09-25T06:10:00.000Z	rukuartic	robzon	Gotcha.
2005-09-25T06:11:00.000Z	robzon	rukuartic	you just need to be in admin group
2005-09-25T06:12:00.000Z	rukuartic	robzon	<-- windows user, switching to linux as soon as he gets fiber
2005-09-25T06:13:00.000Z	robzon	rukuartic	welcome to the world of linux then :)
2005-09-25T06:13:00.000Z	robzon	rukuartic	well, not yet, but soon
2005-09-25T06:15:00.000Z	rukuartic	robzon	How do you log in as root on ubuntu?
2005-09-25T06:15:00.000Z	robzon	rukuartic	you don't
2005-09-25T06:15:00.000Z	rukuartic	robzon	Thats interesting...
2005-09-25T06:16:00.000Z	robzon	rukuartic	you don't need to, because you can allow users to do administrative tasks
2005-09-25T06:16:00.000Z	robzon	rukuartic	it's more secure this way
2005-09-25T06:17:00.000Z	rukuartic	robzon	ok... so is there different levels of administrator levels?
2005-09-25T06:18:00.000Z	robzon	rukuartic	well, almost.. you choose what tasks can a user do
2005-09-25T06:21:00.000Z	rukuartic	robzon	There's a config utility or something?
2005-09-25T06:22:00.000Z	robzon	rukuartic	yup, there is
2005-09-25T06:25:00.000Z	robzon	rukuartic	on ubuntu, you can do everything you could do on any other distro :)
