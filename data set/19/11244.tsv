2006-03-24T17:46:00.000Z	kosnick	jerusalem	: what do you mean? (not that i am an expert but i 'll give it a shot)
2006-03-24T17:46:00.000Z	jerusalem		so up until last week when i clicked the X in the top right of gAIM it minimized to the panel on top
2006-03-24T17:46:00.000Z	jerusalem		w/ a little gAIM icon
2006-03-24T17:47:00.000Z	jerusalem		that i could click on to open the buddy list
2006-03-24T17:47:00.000Z	jerusalem		 now when i click the X it closes the program
2006-03-24T17:48:00.000Z	jerusalem	kosnick	?
2006-03-24T17:48:00.000Z	kosnick		that is the proper thing to do , when you press X it should close , not minimize , exept if you have change that earlier. I mean you probably had it changed before so when you pressed it it minimized the window instead of closing it
2006-03-24T17:49:00.000Z	kosnick		i guess that if you want to change it back to the condition where you press X and it minimizes your window , you should follo the same steps. Just a sec i am looking ffor something
2006-03-24T17:52:00.000Z	kosnick		jerusalem?
