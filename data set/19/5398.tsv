2008-08-05T17:36:00.000Z	Kardoso		I want to install Ubuntu to my old computer, because that computer is unusable now from the lot of viruses.       Config: 1 GB RAM, 5 GB free space, very slow videocard. I dont want to store my work there. Guys please help me in the choice! Which would better for that computer, Ubuntu or Xubuntu?
2008-08-05T17:37:00.000Z	Kardoso		VozniakBR, Indoctrine: Thanks. I will try
2008-08-05T17:37:00.000Z	kenkku	Kardoso	what cpu does it have? a slow video card doesn't really make it necessary to use xubuntu
2008-08-05T17:37:00.000Z	kenkku	Kardoso	if it has 1 GB of ram, it will probably run ubuntu quite well
2008-08-05T17:37:00.000Z	Kardoso	kenkku	Intel Celeron 4,00 Ghz
2008-08-05T17:37:00.000Z	Kardoso	kenkku	I worry about the winchester. Its very very slow.
2008-08-05T17:38:00.000Z	kenkku	Kardoso	winchester?
2008-08-05T17:38:00.000Z	Kardoso	kenkku	yes
2008-08-05T17:38:00.000Z	kenkku	Kardoso	I'm sorry, I didn't understand what you mean by that
2008-08-05T17:38:00.000Z	Kardoso	kenkku	I mean hard drive
2008-08-05T17:39:00.000Z	Kardoso	kenkku	because its five years old
2008-08-05T17:39:00.000Z	kenkku	Kardoso	I would doubt that it matters that much. five years is fairly old though
2008-08-05T17:40:00.000Z	kenkku	Kardoso	I would almost recommend ubuntu, although I don't have much experience with slower machines.
2008-08-05T17:41:00.000Z	kenkku	Kardoso	I don't think you'd lose much even if you did use xubuntu instead of ubuntu
2008-08-05T17:42:00.000Z	kenkku	Kardoso	you can always make it into an ubuntu if you like
2008-08-05T17:45:00.000Z	kenkku	Kardoso	you can install the same programs in xubuntu as you can in ubuntu
2008-08-05T17:46:00.000Z	Kardoso	kenkku	wow! really??? great!
2008-08-05T17:47:00.000Z	kenkku	Kardoso	yes, they have the same repositories. the only difference is what comes on the cd
2008-08-05T17:47:00.000Z	Kardoso	kenkku	great! thank you
