2010-09-09T11:45:00.000Z	reggi	_mrn_ver_	are you sure that the computer is booting from hard disk? that error usually comes when you're booting from network.
2010-09-09T11:46:00.000Z	_mrn_ver_	reggi	wait, it also shows pxe-m0f : exitinig intel pxe rom
2010-09-09T11:47:00.000Z	reggi	_mrn_ver_	you should go to your bios and disable network boot
2010-09-09T11:52:00.000Z	_mrn_ver_	reggi	 i have tried to boot from hard disk again it is showing same .but when i   select network to boot( to disable it) it(bios) shows nothig
2010-09-09T11:54:00.000Z	_mrn_ver_	reggi	 u there?
2010-09-09T11:59:00.000Z	reggi	_mrn_ver_	does it still boot to windows properly?
2010-09-09T12:00:00.000Z	reggi	_mrn_ver_	this problem sounds like your hard disk is not being detected by the boot loader
2010-09-09T12:00:00.000Z	reggi	_mrn_ver_	as a result the computer looks for other devices to boot from like cdrom, usb or network.
2010-09-09T12:02:00.000Z	reggi	_mrn_ver_	one sec lemme see
