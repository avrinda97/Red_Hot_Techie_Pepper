2012-09-17T04:18:00.000Z	chriswere		My gnome install now wants to create a new set of panels as well as the existing ones every time I log in. Why is this?
2012-09-17T04:20:00.000Z	chriswere		sorry about that guys, ubuntu crashed, were one of you guys going to help me?
2012-09-17T04:21:00.000Z	jhansonxi	chriswere	I've seen that with non-Xinerama dual-head (Zaphod mode) multi-monitor configurations.
2012-09-17T04:22:00.000Z	chriswere	jhansonxi	how does one fix this?
2012-09-17T04:24:00.000Z	jhansonxi	chriswere	I didn't find a solution.  I'm using gnome-fallback in normal xinerama mode (Ubuntu 12.04) but am planning to use XFCE since it works in zaphod mode.
2012-09-17T04:25:00.000Z	chriswere	jhansonxi	as if i needed another reason why linux is more diffuclt than it needs to be. Would you also recomend switching to xfce? I'm not sure how to use a zaphod set up, are there any guides?
2012-09-17T04:26:00.000Z	jhansonxi	chriswere	XFCE seems better than gnome-fallback (which is old Gnome 2 updated for GTK3).
2012-09-17T04:27:00.000Z	chriswere	jhansonxi	i've found a lot of bugs in xfce
2012-09-17T04:28:00.000Z	chriswere	jhansonxi	how do I get a window on screen 2 in Zaphos mode?
2012-09-17T04:28:00.000Z	jhansonxi	chriswere	  With my AMD card and the buggy fglrx driver (random "ASIC hang happened" lockups with X.org), the Catalyst Control Center calls it "Multi-display desktop"
2012-09-17T04:29:00.000Z	jhansonxi	chriswere	When Zaphod mode is actually working (XFCE), you configure a second set of panels on the other display along with an applications menu.  Apps can't be dragged from one screen to the next but the clipboard still works.
2012-09-17T04:30:00.000Z	jhansonxi	chriswere	I use Zaphod mode because full-screen games can't take over both displays.  I can still monitor my browser/email/IM on the other display.  Works well with Wine.
2012-09-17T04:31:00.000Z	chriswere		xjhansonxi: stupid question, how do i create a panel in gnome fallback?
2012-09-17T04:33:00.000Z	jhansonxi	chriswere	<logo key><alt><right or left mouse click on existing panel>
2012-09-17T04:34:00.000Z	jhansonxi	chriswere	(Gnome is all about being intuitive :D )
2012-09-17T04:35:00.000Z	chriswere		jhanonxi: any ideas how I might move it to my 2nd screen, I can't work out a way to do that?
2012-09-17T04:36:00.000Z	jhansonxi	chriswere	I don't think it is possible in gnome-fallback (at least not with the version in Ubuntu 12.04), and gnome-fallback doesn't work properly with zaphod (non-xinerama) mode.  All kinds of bad behavior happens.
2012-09-17T04:37:00.000Z	chriswere		jahnsonxi: okay, I'm gonna call it a night now it's 1:37 here in the UK. But I think I'll check out xubuntu in the morning. Thanks so much to you and all the other chaps for being far more patient with me than i deserved.
2012-09-17T04:38:00.000Z	jhansonxi	chriswere	You may have better luck with Xubuntu 12.04 or the Linux Mint XFCE version (Cinnamon, Gnome 3, Unity, and Gnome-fallback all have problems with zaphod mode).  Or you could just use normal Xinerama mode with a wide desktop split across multiple monitors.
