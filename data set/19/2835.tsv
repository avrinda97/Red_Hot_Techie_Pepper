2009-12-22T13:55:00.000Z	mr_e_panda		any one here familiar with Ubuntu on a PS3?
2009-12-22T13:55:00.000Z	mneptok	mr_e_panda	i am familiar with Ubuntu and the PS3, but have not installed Linux on my console.
2009-12-22T13:56:00.000Z	mr_e_panda	mneptok	darn... my questions have to do with not being able to use the sudo command because the alternate cd does not set up a root user
2009-12-22T13:57:00.000Z	mneptok	mr_e_panda	yes it does
2009-12-22T13:57:00.000Z	mneptok	mr_e_panda	what happens when you run sudo?
2009-12-22T13:57:00.000Z	mneptok	mr_e_panda	uhhh .... what screen?
2009-12-22T13:58:00.000Z	mr_e_panda	mneptok	when i type sudo it asks me for my password then tells me that my username is not part of the sudoer file
2009-12-22T13:58:00.000Z	mneptok	mr_e_panda	Ubuntu adds the user created during the install process to the admin group. use that account.
2009-12-22T13:59:00.000Z	mr_e_panda	mneptok	I am using that account
2009-12-22T14:03:00.000Z	mneptok	mr_e_panda	Ubuntu does not use a root user
2009-12-22T14:04:00.000Z	mneptok	mr_e_panda	Ubuntu uses sudo
2009-12-22T14:04:00.000Z	mr_e_panda	mneptok	yes i understand that. but when i use sudo it does not allow me to use sudo
2009-12-22T14:05:00.000Z	mneptok	mr_e_panda	note carefully the user you create during the install process
2009-12-22T14:05:00.000Z	mr_e_panda	mneptok	right
2009-12-22T14:06:00.000Z	mr_e_panda	mneptok	without that information i would not even be able to log in to my desktop
2009-12-22T14:08:00.000Z	mr_e_panda	mneptok	finishing up the installation right now
2009-12-22T14:15:00.000Z	mr_e_panda	mneptok	i just got my sudo to work
2009-12-22T14:16:00.000Z	mneptok	mr_e_panda	yes, yes i am.
2009-12-22T14:18:00.000Z	mneptok	mr_e_panda	np.
