2008-10-31T17:37:00.000Z	tsb		In Arch, gnome 2.24's session-manger isn't working. Moreover, when I click log out, all the apps are simply killed and not properly shut down. Is this a problem in ubuntu 8.10 as well? (if it is, I'll stay at 8.04.1)
2008-10-31T17:38:00.000Z	jrib	tsb	how are you determining the apps are not properly shut down?
2008-10-31T17:40:00.000Z	jrib	tsb	did you see my question?
2008-10-31T17:40:00.000Z	tsb	jrib	no
2008-10-31T17:40:00.000Z	jrib	tsb	how are you determining the apps are not properly shut down?
2008-10-31T17:41:00.000Z	tsb	jrib	well, none of them saves their settings; firefox starts up with the crash-handler after logging in, xchat I had to quit manually otherwise I had to enter the favchannels etc everytime
2008-10-31T17:41:00.000Z	jrib	tsb	let me log out with firefox, one sec
2008-10-31T17:41:00.000Z	tsb	jrib	note, this is in archlinux, NOT ubuntu. but I really hate that so if it is the same in ubuntu 8.10 and gnome 2.24 there I'll just stay at 8.04 and gnome 2.22
2008-10-31T17:42:00.000Z	tsb	jrib	cool, thanks.
2008-10-31T17:43:00.000Z	jrib	tsb	yep, firefox says it was closed unexpectedly.  This is probably related as to why I can't get my sessions to save too.  I remember reading a bug on launchpad that pointed upstream regarding gnome-session and the inability to save sessions
2008-10-31T17:44:00.000Z	tsb	jrib	yes, this is correct. gnome is basically released with 2 horrible, showstopper bugs IMO.
2008-10-31T17:46:00.000Z	tsb	jrib	I couldn't save the sessions in gnome 2.24/archlinux either, another major showstopper. I was planing to use gnome in between kde 4.2 but I think I'll either go to kde again or try something else :) I need a sessionmanager and not to mention the ability to close programs like they should.
2008-10-31T17:46:00.000Z	jrib	tsb	http://live.gnome.org/SessionManagement/NewGnomeSession I guess they didn't finish
2008-10-31T17:47:00.000Z	tsb	jrib	yep
2008-10-31T17:47:00.000Z	jrib	tsb	this gives me a good excuse to try hibernate though
2008-10-31T17:48:00.000Z	tsb	jrib	hehe yeah.. I'll have to check that out myself. Really strange though, such a serious bug, makes ubuntu 8.10 a step backwards for me
2008-10-31T17:49:00.000Z	tsb	jrib	if nothing else, it also gives me a good excuse to check out alternative de/wm's :)
2008-10-31T17:50:00.000Z	jrib	tsb	here's yours: http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=555795
2008-10-31T17:50:00.000Z	tsb	jrib	yep that's the one
