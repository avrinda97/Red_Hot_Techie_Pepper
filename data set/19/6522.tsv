2009-08-06T03:16:00.000Z	FastZ		anyone know why my linux box cannot connect to another linux box that's configured as a router/firewall?  when I connect the two, neither NICs link lights come on, but when i connect any other computer or router to these same NICs, they work like a charm.  Any ideas why they might not be playing nicely with one another?
2009-08-06T03:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	FastZ	are you using a crosover cable?
2009-08-06T03:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	FastZ	For computer to computer communicaion you need a dfferent cable to on that conects a computer to a router
2009-08-06T03:18:00.000Z	FastZ	ActionParsnip	I don't need a cross-over cable.  one of the boxes is a router/firewall
2009-08-06T03:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	FastZ	i bet if you try a crosover cable it will work
2009-08-06T03:19:00.000Z	FastZ	ActionParsnip	im trying to connect one maching to the green interface of the router/firewall box, but when i do this, neither NIC shows the connection as being valid, yet when i connect another computer to the same green interface, it works perfectly and likewise, when i connect the PC to my wireless router via cable, the NIC works perfectly
2009-08-06T03:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	FastZ	is the interface up?
2009-08-06T03:21:00.000Z	FastZ	ActionParsnip	both ints are up, all TCP/IP information is correct on both
2009-08-06T03:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	FastZ	what if you connectthe nic to another device or even a different port on the same interconnection device
2009-08-06T03:23:00.000Z	FastZ	ActionParsnip	lemme build a x-over right quick and test that, if it works, the i owe you an apology
2009-08-06T03:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	FastZ	no need for apology dude, just want to get you on your feet :)
2009-08-06T03:39:00.000Z	FastZ	ActionParsnip	brotkasten, Strider22, ok guys, my mistake completely.  the x-over cable i just made works great.  I guess i was just under the impression that since the one box was configured as a router/firewall, that it would act just as though it was a router/firwewall that was built to be such instead of one that's built from an old PC (486Mhz Intel Celeron !!!! Lightning fast!)
2009-08-06T03:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	FastZ	it ssentially a PC connecing to a PC so the TX needs to hit the RX
2009-08-06T03:40:00.000Z	FastZ	ActionParsnip	roger that, I didnt even think of it that way
2009-08-06T03:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	FastZ	my router is a bsd box on not much faster
2009-08-06T03:41:00.000Z	FastZ	ActionParsnip	im just suprised this old rock still runs.  I bought this one about 12 years ago
2009-08-06T03:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	FastZ	old stff lasts, new stff is made to be disposable
2009-08-06T03:44:00.000Z	FastZ	ActionParsnip	i totally believe that.  I took this particular box apart the other day for the first time in years and i couldnt distinguish any single fin on the CPU heatsink....I figure they were fused to one another by the decade's worth of dust
2009-08-06T03:44:00.000Z	FastZ	ActionParsnip	it seemed to run a little quieter before i cleaned it
