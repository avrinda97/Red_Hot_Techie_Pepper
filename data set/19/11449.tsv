2006-09-05T13:46:00.000Z	eugman		Can anyone illuminate me on the differences between lynx and its two varients.
2006-09-05T13:46:00.000Z	eyequeue	eugman	which are the variants?
2006-09-05T13:46:00.000Z	eyequeue	eugman	different code, different projects
2006-09-05T13:47:00.000Z	eyequeue	eugman	very less features
2006-09-05T13:47:00.000Z	eyequeue	eugman	lynx handles multiple protocols, the other handle only https and http
2006-09-05T13:48:00.000Z	eyequeue	eugman	was there something more specific you needed to do perhaps?
2006-09-05T13:48:00.000Z	eyequeue	eugman	those are the primary ones *nod*
2006-09-05T13:49:00.000Z	eyequeue	eugman	ahh :)  i'd recommend lynx myself, but to write that perhaps you should play with the others a bit too
2006-09-05T13:54:00.000Z	eugman	eyequeue	who me?
2006-09-05T13:54:00.000Z	eyequeue	eugman	no, Ych asked
2006-09-05T13:55:00.000Z	eugman	eyequeue	whoops. The name reminds me of the interjection "ech"
2006-09-05T13:55:00.000Z	eyequeue	eugman	heheh
2006-09-17T09:48:00.000Z	eugman	eyequeue	I'm sure you could get people to start a wiki article that covers all the counter-inttuative terms.
2006-09-17T09:49:00.000Z	eyequeue	eugman	is their server large enough? ;-)
2006-09-17T09:50:00.000Z	eyequeue	eugman	slrn seems rather intuitive to me
2006-09-17T09:50:00.000Z	eyequeue	eugman	it's also cli
2006-09-21T13:51:00.000Z	eyequeue	eugman	i think it's elsewhere in edgy from dapper btw
2006-09-21T13:51:00.000Z	eyequeue	eugman	system > something
2006-09-21T13:52:00.000Z	eugman	eyequeue	thanks for the heads up.
