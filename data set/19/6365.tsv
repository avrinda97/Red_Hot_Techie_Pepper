2010-04-06T11:25:00.000Z	Wings		Hey guys.
2010-04-06T11:25:00.000Z	Wings		I need some help after trashing /home/, anyone got experience with that?
2010-04-06T11:25:00.000Z	Wings		I don't need to recover any data, just to get a plain blank user functioning.
2010-04-06T11:26:00.000Z	maginot	Wings	rm -rf /home ?
2010-04-06T11:26:00.000Z	Wings	maginot	Not quite.
2010-04-06T11:27:00.000Z	maginot	Wings	okay, can't see any problem on that, you could delete everything insde that
2010-04-06T11:27:00.000Z	maginot	Wings	the only thing that could happen deleting things inside home is reset program configurations
2010-04-06T11:27:00.000Z	Wings	maginot	Well...
2010-04-06T11:28:00.000Z	maginot	Wings	this is something I done many time to reset everything to default
2010-04-06T11:28:00.000Z	maginot	Wings	I think your program wasn't just deleting the files
2010-04-06T11:29:00.000Z	maginot	Wings	 *program/problem
2010-04-06T11:30:00.000Z	maginot	Wings	it's a godd start reboting or closing and reopening the session
2010-04-06T11:30:00.000Z	Wings	maginot	already did so.
2010-04-06T11:30:00.000Z	Wings	maginot	but I have a liveCD up on the machine now
2010-04-06T11:30:00.000Z	maginot	Wings	what is the permissions for /home (ls -l /home
2010-04-06T11:33:00.000Z	Wings	maginot	ehh.
2010-04-06T11:33:00.000Z	Wings	maginot	I've decided since I have a LiveCD booted up already
2010-04-06T11:34:00.000Z	maginot	Wings	hehe
2010-04-06T11:34:00.000Z	maginot	Wings	well, haven't tested the beta .. don't know how good it is (or bad)
