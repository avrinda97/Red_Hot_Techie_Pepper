2011-04-25T09:53:00.000Z	POOPHAMMER		i hope this install goes past configuring hardware this time
2011-04-25T09:54:00.000Z	POOPHAMMER		it locked up at generating /boot/initrd.im etc last time

2011-04-25T09:57:00.000Z	POOPHAMMER		seems like ubuntu is locking up at the same part as last :/
2011-04-25T09:59:00.000Z	POOPHAMMER		sudo is only bad when you use bad commands with it :P

2011-04-25T10:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	POOPHAMMER	are you having install issues?
2011-04-25T10:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	POOPHAMMER	did you MD5 test the ISO you downloaded?
2011-04-25T10:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	POOPHAMMER	what does that mean?
2011-04-25T10:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	POOPHAMMER	can you please use ENGLISH in replys, it speeds things up
2011-04-25T10:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	POOPHAMMER	did you test your RAM?
2011-04-25T10:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	POOPHAMMER	are you using a CD to install, or USB?
2011-04-25T10:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	POOPHAMMER	did you burn the CD as slowly as you were allowed and did you make the CD test itself when it started to boot?
2011-04-25T10:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	POOPHAMMER	on the same screen as the ram test you can check the CD for consistency too
2011-04-25T10:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	POOPHAMMER	whatever you desire
