2010-02-12T23:48:00.000Z	trism	abstrakt	if this is just a dev machine, I usually leave /var/www as root:root and create symbolic links to projects in $HOME/Websites there, so I can edit them normally
2010-02-12T23:56:00.000Z	abstrakt	trism	hmm... so i can edit the root files without root perms just by putting symlinks in my home folder?
2010-02-13T00:00:00.000Z	trism	abstrakt	I never said anything about editing root files, you have a project in $HOME/Websites/someproject, owned, by you, you place a symbolic link to it in /var/www, and you can access it, but the directory is owned by you
2010-02-13T00:00:00.000Z	abstrakt	trism	ohhh ok, not enough info, i thought you meant the reverse, place symlinks in the home folder
2010-02-13T00:00:00.000Z	trism	abstrakt	oh, sorry, the other way around
2010-02-13T00:01:00.000Z	abstrakt	trism	k, so i mean, why would that be any different though from just telling the vhosts to use /home/abstrakt/Websites/mysite/html as document root
2010-02-13T00:01:00.000Z	trism	abstrakt	it isn't really
2010-02-13T00:02:00.000Z	abstrakt	trism	ok so that's how i have it setup right now, my vhosts just point their document roots straight to my home folder, but i'm getting 403 forbidden
2010-02-13T00:03:00.000Z	trism	abstrakt	I have no idea, I don't mess with apache that much, which is why I use the sym link on my dev machine, then I don't generally have to mess with the default apache config at all
2010-02-13T00:03:00.000Z	abstrakt	trism	do you use vhosts?
2010-02-13T00:09:00.000Z	trism	abstrakt	sorry, I don't know, was just trying to suggest an alternative way, hope you get it all working
2010-02-13T00:18:00.000Z	trism	abstrakt	I see, yeah, that would do it, so it's working now?
2010-02-13T00:24:00.000Z	abstrakt	trism	yup, but i'm not satisfied, so i'm gonna set it up how i usually do, manually chown /var/www to my user
2010-02-15T03:11:00.000Z	trism	abstrakt	old flash versions are archived here http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/142/tn_14266.html , you need to download an archive with all the releases for a specific version
2010-02-15T03:12:00.000Z	abstrakt	trism	thanks
2010-02-16T08:48:00.000Z	trism	abstrakt	right click, select properties, open with tab, change the radio button to gvim
2010-02-16T08:49:00.000Z	abstrakt	trism	any way to do that for *all* file types that are currently set to use gedit... e.g. all at once, so I don't have to do it for every file type?
2010-02-16T08:51:00.000Z	trism	abstrakt	I'm sure there are, but I don't know of any specific tools for it right at the moment
2011-12-11T04:54:00.000Z	trism	abstrakt	doesn't seem to find gvim here either, unless I copy /usr/share/applications/gvim.desktop to ~/.local/share/applications, then it pops right up
