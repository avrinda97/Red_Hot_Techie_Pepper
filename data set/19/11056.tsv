2006-04-29T05:20:00.000Z	harisund		What does the grub option "rescue mode" do, aside from logging me in as root?
2006-04-29T05:20:00.000Z	hachre	harisund	it starts in runlevel 1
2006-04-29T05:21:00.000Z	hachre	harisund	which is single user mode
2006-04-29T05:21:00.000Z	harisund	hachre	does that mean the disks are mounted at that point?
2006-04-29T05:21:00.000Z	hachre	harisund	i think so
2006-04-29T05:21:00.000Z	hachre	harisund	if they dont depend on network or raid or something
2006-04-29T05:21:00.000Z	harisund	hachre	I am asking because I want to run a fsck, for which the disks are not supposed to be mounted. I can do it booting in liveCD..
2006-04-29T05:21:00.000Z	hachre	harisund	you can only do it using a bootcd or another installation
2006-04-29T05:22:00.000Z	hachre	harisund	at least for the / disk
2006-04-29T05:22:00.000Z	hachre	harisund	for some fscks its enough to mount ro
2006-04-29T05:22:00.000Z	hachre	harisund	you can try using mount / -o ro,remount to do that
2006-04-29T05:22:00.000Z	hachre	harisund	but it fails most of the time
2006-04-29T05:23:00.000Z	harisund	hachre	Well thanks for the tips.. I think I can use a LiveCD.. and preferrably a smaller live CD than the Ubuntu one, since I want to only bootin command line mode
2006-04-29T05:23:00.000Z	hachre	harisund	hehe
2006-04-29T05:23:00.000Z	hachre	harisund	good luck :)
2006-04-29T05:23:00.000Z	harisund	hachre	thanks.. though I doubt my hard disk is bad.. It automatically fscks every 30 times anyway.
2006-04-29T05:24:00.000Z	hachre	harisund	if you think its physically damaged do a badblocks on its device
2006-04-29T05:24:00.000Z	harisund	hachre	I doubt that. amphi: yeah, I am going to use the SysRescueCD anyway. It has something called partimage which might come in handy for me :)
2006-04-29T05:27:00.000Z	hachre	harisund	cya around :)
