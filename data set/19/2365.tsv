2012-04-19T07:34:00.000Z	linux_is_my_hero		how do i get around forgetting my admin password?
2012-04-19T07:34:00.000Z	yeik	linux_is_my_hero	 i use password safe to store all my passwords
2012-04-19T07:49:00.000Z	yeik	linux_is_my_hero	you get 200,000 songs right? not enough space?
2012-04-19T07:49:00.000Z	linux_is_my_hero	yeik	it 20,000 and no its not enough
2012-04-19T07:50:00.000Z	linux_is_my_hero	yeik	fantastic interface though
2012-04-19T07:50:00.000Z	yeik	linux_is_my_hero	 you legally have more than 20,000 songs? wow
2012-04-19T08:10:00.000Z	yeik	linux_is_my_hero	if its encrypted you can't just change the password
2012-04-19T08:10:00.000Z	yeik	linux_is_my_hero	all the files for the user will need to  be removed. unless you have the key/restore
2012-04-19T08:10:00.000Z	linux_is_my_hero	yeik	so i might as well do a fresh install?
2012-04-19T08:10:00.000Z	linux_is_my_hero	yeik	screw this im going to bed.
2012-04-19T08:11:00.000Z	yeik	linux_is_my_hero	do you have important files?
2012-04-19T08:11:00.000Z	linux_is_my_hero	yeik	yes i have important files
2012-04-19T08:12:00.000Z	yeik	linux_is_my_hero	you might need  more of an expert then, someone who knows about encrypted user info.
2012-04-19T08:12:00.000Z	linux_is_my_hero	yeik	i changed the root password a few minutes ago
2012-04-19T08:12:00.000Z	linux_is_my_hero	yeik	for some reason the gui won't let me log in
2012-04-19T08:13:00.000Z	yeik	linux_is_my_hero	root can't login by default
2012-04-19T08:13:00.000Z	linux_is_my_hero	yeik	can't root change any users password and get around encryption?
2012-04-19T08:14:00.000Z	linux_is_my_hero	yeik	so basically i'll never be able to get back into that account?
2012-04-19T08:15:00.000Z	yeik	linux_is_my_hero	is that the account you changed the password on?
