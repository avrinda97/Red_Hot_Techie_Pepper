2006-06-30T12:09:00.000Z	Madpilot	stromham	EasyUbuntu isn't in the default repos
2006-06-30T12:10:00.000Z	Madpilot	stromham	that's the trouble with Google & Ubuntu currently
2006-06-30T12:28:00.000Z	Madpilot	stromham	is Gobotu yours?
2006-06-30T12:36:00.000Z	Madpilot	stromham	if people do keep poking the bot when they dont' need to, I might ask you to remove it...
2006-06-30T12:40:00.000Z	Madpilot	stromham	does Gobotu use google.com/linux, or what?
2006-06-30T12:52:00.000Z	Madpilot	stromham	many of the things you're hitting Gobotu for already have !tells in ubotu...
2006-06-30T13:09:00.000Z	Madpilot	stromham	there are actually Freenode servers all over the world - but that's a topic to be continued on #ubuntu-offtopic, if at all
2006-06-30T13:01:00.000Z	Madpilot	stromham	auto-rejoin is not cool, especially in bots...
2006-06-30T13:05:00.000Z	Madpilot	stromham	it's an intesting idea, but we've already got a couple of bots in residence, and ubotu can be chatty enough already...
