2009-01-07T09:03:00.000Z	Kole		well i assume ubuntu comes with an mp3 and basic video player?
2009-01-07T09:04:00.000Z	daw	Kole	actually, as I just found out, it does not. mp3 is a restricted format so you have install the codecs, they aren't there by default
2009-01-07T09:04:00.000Z	Kole		dang
2009-01-07T09:04:00.000Z	Kole		codec easy to find?
2009-01-07T09:05:00.000Z	daw	Kole	sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras
2009-01-07T09:06:00.000Z	Kole	daw	- and thats it?
2009-01-07T09:06:00.000Z	Kole		why is it restricted?
2009-01-07T09:06:00.000Z	daw	Kole	-- it is not a true free format
2009-01-07T09:07:00.000Z	Kole		ohhh ok
2009-01-07T09:07:00.000Z	daw	Kole	- the explanation is found here: http://www.ubuntu.com/community/ubuntustory/philosophy
