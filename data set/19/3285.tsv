2010-07-24T23:01:00.000Z	neocortex		Hello again! I just tried rsync, but had no luck with it to copy my home folder to usb hdd. Previously, I tried cp -fr and cp-a and even tar cvpjf. No luck! Please, help! Either some files are not allowed to be copied or are too big for tar.
2010-07-24T23:02:00.000Z	sharplinux	neocortex	what was the specific command you used?
2010-07-24T23:03:00.000Z	sharplinux	neocortex	you mentioned rsync?
2010-07-24T23:04:00.000Z	sharplinux	neocortex	was there an error?
2010-07-24T23:06:00.000Z	neocortex	sharplinux	yes: too big file and some are not allowed to be copied. I even logout and did everything as root, from console
2010-07-24T23:07:00.000Z	sharplinux	neocortex	what sort of filesystem is on the USB HDD?  ext3?  ntfs?  fat?
2010-07-24T23:07:00.000Z	neocortex	sharplinux	fat32
2010-07-24T23:07:00.000Z	sharplinux	neocortex	fat32 has a 4GB limit for file transfers
2010-07-24T23:08:00.000Z	neocortex	sharplinux	Oooo stupid me
2010-07-24T23:08:00.000Z	sharplinux	neocortex	not stupid - I had to learn that too :-)
2010-07-24T23:08:00.000Z	neocortex	sharplinux	Then, I just need to make ext3 fs?
2010-07-24T23:09:00.000Z	sharplinux	neocortex	do you need it to be visible on Windows (or Mac)?
2010-07-24T23:10:00.000Z	sharplinux	neocortex	if not, ext3 would be ideal
2010-07-24T23:10:00.000Z	neocortex	sharplinux	Yes, I would prefer that, although I use Linux only and VirutalBox Win XP for some compatibility with my colleagues
2010-07-24T23:11:00.000Z	neocortex	sharplinux	Can I exclude whole .VirtualBox folder?
2010-07-24T23:12:00.000Z	sharplinux	neocortex	it *looks like* the rsync option would be --exclude='.VirtualBox' if you wanted to (see man rsync
2010-07-24T23:14:00.000Z	neocortex	sharplinux	H__, THANKS A LOT! So, I should do: rsync -a --exclude=.VirtualBox? rsync is better than cp?
2010-07-24T23:15:00.000Z	sharplinux	neocortex	that should work - yes, rsync is better (designed for what you're doing), and you're welcome
2010-07-24T23:15:00.000Z	neocortex	sharplinux	THANKS!
