2012-01-31T18:18:00.000Z	bijoyvj		guess moving back to lucid lynx will be the best option?
2012-01-31T18:19:00.000Z	bijoyvj		yes searched, but did not find any
2012-01-31T18:21:00.000Z	bijoyvj		no, not sure how to do that
2012-01-31T18:23:00.000Z	bijoyvj		I am a newbie. sorry
2012-01-31T18:24:00.000Z	bijoyvj		yes phone line connected to a modem and connected to network card
2012-01-31T18:24:00.000Z	bijoyvj		does that help?
2012-01-31T18:24:00.000Z	bijoyvj		connection is dsl
2012-01-31T18:25:00.000Z	bijoyvj		i believe it must be a router. it also has wireless capability and can connect multiple lines
2012-01-31T18:26:00.000Z	bijoyvj		ok
2012-01-31T18:27:00.000Z	bijoyvj		let me add some more info on the connection issue
2012-01-31T18:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bijoyvj	can you ping 8.8.8.8?
2012-01-31T18:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bijoyvj	have you tried wicd
2012-01-31T18:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bijoyvj	its an alternative to network manager, install wicd then uninstall network manager, then reboot
2012-01-31T18:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bijoyvj	if you only always use the wired connection I'd just use the interfaces file and not even bother with a network manager app
2012-01-31T18:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bijoyvj	i can give you a page on how to set it up
2012-01-31T18:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bijoyvj	after you type: action   press TAB ;)
2012-01-31T18:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bijoyvj	http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-configure-a-static-ip-address-tutorial/   scroll halfway down to the ubuntu/debian section
2012-01-31T18:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bijoyvj	see how wicd goes, you'll need to reboot after uninstalling network manager
2012-01-31T18:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bijoyvj	you'll needs SPACE and ENTER to set it
