2011-05-17T15:10:00.000Z	Osa2		Hi all, I would like to test drive ubuntu server as a replacement of a windows 2003 server.
2011-05-17T15:11:00.000Z	Osa2		What kind of items will I be missing out or will I be able to preserve all functions?
2011-05-17T15:11:00.000Z	pfifo	Osa2	it depends what services you run
2011-05-17T15:12:00.000Z	Osa2	pfifo	I now run AD, dhcp server, terminal server, exchange server, VPN, printing server
2011-05-17T15:13:00.000Z	pfifo	Osa2	there is no AD in linux obivously, but the rest are replaceable
2011-05-17T15:14:00.000Z	pfifo	Osa2	however linux has its own solutions to AD if your replacing all your desktops as well
2011-05-17T15:15:00.000Z	pfifo	Osa2	in linux we would use ftp for filesharing
2011-05-17T15:15:00.000Z	Osa2	pfifo	I understand but my situation would be to change the server not the workstations. Because otherwise they loose word/excel and a custom written accounting program for window$
2011-05-17T15:16:00.000Z	pfifo	Osa2	we have samba support but not the full scale AD so you could still have remote file access
2011-05-17T15:17:00.000Z	pfifo	Osa2	I highly recommend using linux for dhcp dns and mail
2011-05-17T15:19:00.000Z	Osa2	pfifo	and can windows clients access the linux mailserver?
2011-05-17T15:20:00.000Z	pfifo	Osa2	if your using pop3 and smtp (and/or several other protocols)
2011-05-17T15:21:00.000Z	pfifo	Osa2	there are several webmail apps available, but you obivously need a webserver running too
2011-05-17T15:24:00.000Z	pfifo	Osa2	its basicly preinstalled package differences with the *ubuntu. debian, fedora and suse have some major differences though
2011-05-17T15:26:00.000Z	pfifo	Osa2	there is alot more options available on linux, and the different distros will explot this
2011-05-17T15:28:00.000Z	Osa2	pfifo	and how about backups can these be done easily? Block level or dedup?
2011-05-17T15:28:00.000Z	pfifo	Osa2	there is a wide selection of clone/backup tools
2011-05-17T15:30:00.000Z	pfifo	Osa2	ubuntu has great support for new admins
2011-05-17T15:31:00.000Z	pfifo	Osa2	actuall avoid gentoo for a production server at all cost
