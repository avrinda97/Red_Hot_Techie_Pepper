2011-06-28T07:43:00.000Z	subimage		anyone know why after installing 11.04 from USB without downloading packages or 3rd party tools I can't get the GUI to boot?
2011-06-28T07:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	subimage	what video chip do you use?
2011-06-28T07:44:00.000Z	subimage		i can get to terminal fine if i alt-ctrl-f1 but if i just let it boot my monitor gets no signal. this is on an ati radeon 5xxx
2011-06-28T07:44:00.000Z	subimage		i think its a 5670
2011-06-28T07:44:00.000Z	subimage		5760...somethin like that
2011-06-28T07:44:00.000Z	subimage		yeah
2011-06-28T07:45:00.000Z	subimage		like i see it begin to go through its little dot splash screen
2011-06-28T07:45:00.000Z	subimage		then the monitor just loses...and yes dvi
2011-06-28T07:45:00.000Z	subimage		like i said, i can see terminal on same output just fine
2011-06-28T07:45:00.000Z	subimage		is it because 11.04 is "beta" or is that just a fluke?
2011-06-28T07:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	subimage	try the boot option: nomodeset
2011-06-28T07:45:00.000Z	subimage	ActionParsnip	how do i do that?
2011-06-28T07:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	subimage	11.04 isn't beta, its released and stable
2011-06-28T07:46:00.000Z	subimage	ActionParsnip	ok
2011-06-28T07:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		!bootoption | subimage
2011-06-28T07:46:00.000Z	subimage		!nomodeset
2011-06-28T07:47:00.000Z	subimage	ActionParsnip	is that "safe graphics mode" then?
2011-06-28T07:47:00.000Z	subimage		nmind /me reads forum
2011-06-28T07:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	subimage	it will give you a deskto, you  can then install updates and/or the ati proprietary driver if you wish which should then fix things
