2009-06-17T04:47:00.000Z	lws_		must be my ghost.... spoooooky
2009-06-17T04:48:00.000Z	cabrey	lws_	anyway, ath_pci is blacklisted I believe
2009-06-17T04:48:00.000Z	lws_	cabrey	BUt it still won't load automatically at boot
2009-06-17T04:48:00.000Z	lws_	cabrey	Even Jockey says it's "Activated, but not loaded"
2009-06-17T04:49:00.000Z	cabrey	lws_	it should be automatically detected at boot, you should not need to list it in /etc/modules
2009-06-17T04:49:00.000Z	cabrey	lws_	oh it's a proprietary driver?
2009-06-17T04:49:00.000Z	lws_	cabrey	It's madwifi
2009-06-17T04:50:00.000Z	lws_	cabrey	8139too also isn't loaded at boot.   Is it possible avahi has gone mad, or somesuch?
2009-06-17T04:58:00.000Z	cabrey	lws_	submit a bug, jockey should do all of that automatically
2009-06-17T04:58:00.000Z	lws_	cabrey	 LOts of people use madwifi,  I'm thinking it's something I did to the system to break it?
2009-06-17T04:59:00.000Z	cabrey	lws_	run lsmod and paste it
2009-06-17T04:59:00.000Z	cabrey	lws_	use pastebin
2009-06-17T05:03:00.000Z	lws_	cabrey	http://pastebin.com/d1760f341
2009-06-17T05:03:00.000Z	lws_	cabrey	I wonder if it's because I need to put wlan and ath_hal before it in /etc/modules?   I forgot it doesn't look up dependencies like modprobe does.
2009-06-17T05:04:00.000Z	cabrey	lws_	ok all the modules you are having problems with are loaded. did you manually load them in?
2009-06-17T05:04:00.000Z	lws_	cabrey	Yes
2009-06-17T05:04:00.000Z	cabrey	lws_	yes dependencies matter
2009-06-17T05:05:00.000Z	lws_	cabrey	OKay I just added those to /etc/modules.   I will try rebooting
2009-06-17T05:05:00.000Z	lws_	cabrey	thanks for your help
