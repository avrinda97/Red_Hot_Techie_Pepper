2008-03-02T19:57:00.000Z	danand	Ubuntu-Noob	- have you installed the restricted gfx driver yet?
2008-03-02T19:58:00.000Z	danand	Ubuntu-Noob	- ok. go to system -> administration -> restricted driver management
2008-03-02T19:59:00.000Z	danand	Ubuntu-Noob	- patience - i'm a slow typist :)
2008-03-02T20:01:00.000Z	danand	Ubuntu-Noob	- enable that then restart your system. hopefully after that you will be able to set the screen res you want
2008-03-02T20:36:00.000Z	danand	Ubuntu-Noob	- how are you getting along?
2008-03-02T20:38:00.000Z	danand	Ubuntu-Noob	- cool :D
2008-03-02T20:40:00.000Z	Ubuntu-Noob	danand	any ideas?
2008-03-02T20:40:00.000Z	danand	Ubuntu-Noob	- what is axereus? is it an ubuntu package?
2008-03-02T20:42:00.000Z	danand	Ubuntu-Noob	- thats not the preferred method for installing packages in ubuntu - why dont you have a look in the synaptics package manager for a bit-torrent client? there are some good ones in there
2008-03-02T20:44:00.000Z	danand	Ubuntu-Noob	- applications -> accesories -> terminal - be careful with sudo command - you can easily damage your system running with super user privelidges
2008-03-02T20:47:00.000Z	danand	Ubuntu-Noob	- check out the synaptics package manager - i think it has the bit torrent client you want - see System -> admin -> synaptics package manager. click search and enter bit torrent to see list of clients - azureus is listed in there
