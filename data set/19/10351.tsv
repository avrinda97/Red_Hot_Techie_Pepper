2006-06-20T13:47:00.000Z	dershodan		hey guys dont you know any software that can connect to my mobile phone via usb?
2006-06-20T13:48:00.000Z	dershodan		of viruses ... others that might use the computer
2006-06-20T13:48:00.000Z	Lynoure	dershodan	Actually, when it comes to viruses and malware, having full sudo is about as bad
2006-06-20T13:49:00.000Z	Lynoure	dershodan	and Recovery boot from grub menu gives one root very easily :) But sudo reduces the risk of rm -rf as the wrong user, for example :)
2006-06-20T14:01:00.000Z	Lynoure	dershodan	Mobile phones are pretty non-standard... I don't know any Linux tools for them but I haven't really looked. Worth asking the seller/maker about it.
2006-06-20T14:06:00.000Z	Lynoure	dershodan	there is startalk but that covers just maybe one phone Motorola StarTac, and works over serial :(
2006-06-20T14:09:00.000Z	dershodan	Lynoure	thanks for helping me seek, but im on track of mybe something more ... sophisticated ;) ill inform you

2006-06-20T14:12:00.000Z	Lynoure	dershodan	Is the phone good, btw? I will need to get a new one soon (resigning and the company will keep this old nokia phone)
2006-06-20T14:13:00.000Z	dershodan	Lynoure	hehe its ok, but i guess many mobiles are... however i took this because it was the best deal with the actual provider
2006-06-20T14:16:00.000Z	Lynoure	dershodan	they just started allowing provider&phone tied deals here.
2006-06-20T14:18:00.000Z	dershodan	Lynoure	where are you from? (me Austria)
2006-06-20T14:22:00.000Z	Lynoure	dershodan	Finland (the homeland of Linux and IRC)
