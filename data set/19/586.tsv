2011-12-07T13:40:00.000Z	WanderingEnder	mohammadtiti	instead of bothering with a bunch of !commands at you, I'll give you the run down: If nobody's responded, nobody awake knows.
2011-12-07T13:40:00.000Z	mohammadtiti	WanderingEnder	you mean nobody knows the answer here?
2011-12-07T13:41:00.000Z	WanderingEnder	mohammadtiti	the person who knows may not be awake / active in the channel. Or, they may not be looking at the window.
2011-12-07T13:42:00.000Z	WanderingEnder	mohammadtiti	Didn't you state that 11.10 worked?
2011-12-07T13:43:00.000Z	WanderingEnder	mohammadtiti	Why use an older version?
2011-12-07T13:48:00.000Z	WanderingEnder	mohammadtiti	I use the minimal on my older servers, it deals with all sorts of screwups of hardware.
