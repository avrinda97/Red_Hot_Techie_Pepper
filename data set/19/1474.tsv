2011-01-22T23:13:00.000Z	YouKay		Can anyone please point me to a guide to setup an ethernet connection (using a crossover cable alone) between two Ubuntus? One of them is 10.04, and the other is 10.10. :D
2011-01-22T23:14:00.000Z	erUSUL	YouKay	use network manager connection editor to set up static ip's on both ends
2011-01-22T23:15:00.000Z	YouKay	erUSUL	Do I need to create a new connection for that? Or will I just configure autoeth0?
2011-01-22T23:15:00.000Z	erUSUL	YouKay	but if the purpose is sharing internet the ics factoid/guide is what you want
2011-01-22T23:16:00.000Z	YouKay	erUSUL	I just want it for fire sharing, nothing else. I have independent net connections
2011-01-22T23:16:00.000Z	erUSUL	YouKay	ok
2011-01-22T23:44:00.000Z	YouKay	erUSUL	After creating a new connection, I edited it and went to IP4v tab, and set it to "Manual" , and added a new address with same gateway and netmask on both computers and different IPs. Is this the correct procedure?
2011-01-22T23:44:00.000Z	erUSUL	YouKay	do not set gateaway; just ip and netmask
2011-01-22T23:47:00.000Z	erUSUL	YouKay	works here ( lucid )
2011-01-22T23:48:00.000Z	YouKay	erUSUL	dotblank: Got it. I created a new connection and it worked. :) But how may I test the connection if it works?
2011-01-22T23:49:00.000Z	erUSUL	YouKay	ping one computer from the other
2011-01-22T23:49:00.000Z	erUSUL	YouKay	ping put.ip.he.re
2011-01-22T23:50:00.000Z	YouKay	erUSUL	Oh, thanks. :)
2011-02-09T17:26:00.000Z	erUSUL	YouKay	lp or lpr
2011-02-09T17:26:00.000Z	YouKay	erUSUL	Oh! Should have realized it, thanks
2011-02-18T20:08:00.000Z	erUSUL	YouKay	enable extglobs and try !(*/)
2011-02-18T20:08:00.000Z	YouKay	erUSUL	jrib: Ok, thanks. :)
2011-02-18T20:09:00.000Z	erUSUL	YouKay	it looks that that wont do it ...
2011-02-18T20:09:00.000Z	erUSUL	YouKay	find it is then
