2007-10-22T19:17:00.000Z	josss	Slart	ati X1300 pro
2007-10-22T19:17:00.000Z	Slart	josss	hmm.. I'm not really familiar with ATI graphics cards.. sorry.. try asking the room about ATI graphics and 7.10 boot.. I'm sure there are people here that can help you
2007-10-22T19:18:00.000Z	josss	Slart	so,what graphic card are you using?
2007-10-22T19:19:00.000Z	Slart	josss	I've got a nvidia card... it has it's problems too.. and I guess in a year or so I'll be asking you for advice (since ATI has started to release open source drivers) =)
2007-10-22T19:32:00.000Z	josss	Slart	is 1024X768 a common resolution for today pc?
2007-10-22T19:33:00.000Z	Slart	josss	I'd say yes.. 1027x768 is almost a baseline resolution today.. few people have less.. but many have more.. I use 1280x1024
2007-10-22T19:34:00.000Z	josss	Slart	what is 1280x1024x32 means?
2007-10-22T19:34:00.000Z	Slart	josss	1280 is horizontal resolution, 1024 is vertical resolution, 32 is number of bits for colour.. 32 bits = 4 billion colors?
