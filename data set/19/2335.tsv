2011-09-15T21:00:00.000Z	ubuntu_	zteam	: where can i do this
2011-09-15T21:01:00.000Z	zteam	ubuntu_	there is an option in the plugin menu but you can't do it while you are burning something of course
2011-09-15T21:04:00.000Z	zteam	ubuntu_	why not just burn your most valueable files on a couple of DVDs or something?
