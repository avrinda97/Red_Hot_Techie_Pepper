2006-11-27T08:29:00.000Z	eep		no
2006-11-27T08:29:00.000Z	eep		it doesn't
2006-11-27T08:29:00.000Z	eep		i just made a text file and tried saving it as blah.txt
2006-11-27T08:29:00.000Z	eep		but it isn't really a plain text file
2006-11-27T08:29:00.000Z	w3ccv	eep	 Linux (all unices) don't havew "extensions" like DOS does
2006-11-27T08:30:00.000Z	w3ccv	eep	the only way to change the file type is to change the file.
2006-11-27T08:30:00.000Z	w3ccv	eep	use vo
2006-11-27T08:30:00.000Z	w3ccv	eep	use vi  corrected
2006-11-27T08:33:00.000Z	w3ccv	eep	 look for vim - a vi clone
2006-11-27T08:34:00.000Z	w3ccv	eep	they both are,  they are not word processors
2006-11-27T08:53:00.000Z	w3ccv	eep	I don't know what you're doing ot gedit - it only saves to text here.
2006-11-27T08:53:00.000Z	eep	w3ccv	 when i save a file using gedit, it saves as an rtf file
2006-11-27T08:55:00.000Z	w3ccv	eep	what do you mean by RTF file?
2006-11-27T08:55:00.000Z	eep	w3ccv	 it's mime type is application/rtf
2006-11-27T08:56:00.000Z	w3ccv	eep	how do you know it's mime type - use list (filename) and see what it is
2006-11-27T08:57:00.000Z	eep	w3ccv	i looked at the properties of the file
2006-11-27T08:57:00.000Z	w3ccv	eep	what with
2006-11-27T09:02:00.000Z	w3ccv	eep	are you using Ubunto (or any other linux) or OsX
