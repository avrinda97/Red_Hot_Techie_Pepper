2009-08-01T20:51:00.000Z	RaceCondition		what does the "Basic Ubuntu Server" install option give me?
2009-08-01T20:51:00.000Z	RaceCondition		like what packages
2009-08-01T20:52:00.000Z	funkyHat	RaceCondition	nothing graphical, ssh server I believe, probably just that and the essentials. You choose which services you want to install on top
2009-08-01T20:53:00.000Z	RaceCondition	funkyHat	SSH server is a separate install option
2009-08-01T20:54:00.000Z	funkyHat	RaceCondition	oh ok, well if it doesn't even have that, probably hardly anything!
2009-08-01T20:54:00.000Z	RaceCondition	funkyHat	I just want to decide whether I need it or not
2009-08-01T20:54:00.000Z	funkyHat	RaceCondition	whether you need what?
2009-08-01T20:54:00.000Z	RaceCondition	funkyHat	to select the "Basic Ubuntu Server" installation option when doing  a minimal virtual machine Ubuntu install
2009-08-01T20:55:00.000Z	RaceCondition	funkyHat	...or not
2009-08-01T20:55:00.000Z	funkyHat	RaceCondition	oh I see, it's an additional option in the installer? No, if something is missing that you want to install you can just add it later
2009-08-01T20:55:00.000Z	RaceCondition	funkyHat	yes, it's an option
2009-08-01T21:08:00.000Z	funkyHat	RaceCondition	did you figure it out?
2009-08-01T21:08:00.000Z	RaceCondition	funkyHat	yeah, I just skipped that option
2009-08-01T21:08:00.000Z	funkyHat	RaceCondition	cool
2009-08-01T21:09:00.000Z	RaceCondition	funkyHat	I mean, what can possibly go wrong - everything's an apt package anyway
2009-08-01T21:09:00.000Z	funkyHat	RaceCondition	exactly
2009-08-01T21:10:00.000Z	RaceCondition	funkyHat	which is why I love debian/ubuntu
2009-08-01T21:16:00.000Z	funkyHat	RaceCondition	install the package command-not-found
2009-08-01T21:16:00.000Z	RaceCondition	funkyHat	yeah, I got that myself, but it's not telling me which package has the man command...
