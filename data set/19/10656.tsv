2006-07-10T10:59:00.000Z	edan		ah. I found where to change th eALT behaviour. cool
2006-07-10T11:00:00.000Z	edan		snap
2006-07-10T11:00:00.000Z	edan		use VNC
2006-07-10T11:01:00.000Z	edan		get the GParted live CD
2006-07-10T11:02:00.000Z	edan		DarkLegacy,: the GParted live CD works the same way Partition Magic on Windows does
2006-07-10T11:02:00.000Z	edan		you'd resize the partition to create free space and then create a new partition, yeah
2006-07-10T11:03:00.000Z	edan		I reckon 15GB would be enough but might be very slow
2006-07-10T07:33:00.000Z	edan		howdy all
2006-07-10T07:34:00.000Z	edan		is it possible to get fullscreen maximize in Gnome?
2006-07-10T07:34:00.000Z	rixxon	edan	in certain programs yes, try F11 or look around in the menus
2006-07-10T07:34:00.000Z	edan	rixxon	I'm talking about the same method Windows uses
2006-07-10T07:35:00.000Z	rixxon	edan	i don't know about no fullscreen maximize in windows
2006-07-10T07:35:00.000Z	edan		cos in gnome, it just resizes the window and sticks it to the border. i.e. I can easily pull and move it around
2006-07-10T07:35:00.000Z	rixxon	edan	normal maximization is achieved with the maximize button (or alt+f10)
2006-07-10T07:35:00.000Z	edan		that's not Windows-style maximize tho. that's Mac-style
2006-07-10T07:35:00.000Z	rixxon	edan	so don't move it around ;)
2006-07-10T07:35:00.000Z	edan		hehe
2006-07-10T07:36:00.000Z	edan		so basically, the answer is just plain no?
2006-07-10T07:36:00.000Z	rixxon	edan	i wouldn't call myself an expert, so i wouldn't say plain no.
