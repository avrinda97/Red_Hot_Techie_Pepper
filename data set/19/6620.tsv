2008-01-08T10:11:00.000Z	WinShade		i recently got a laptop my friend wuz gunna just throw away. i've been wanting to try ubuntu forever so what better opportunity. unfortunately it runs in "low graphics mode". after the dialog disappears it remains in a black screen. Somewhere I read I can just press ctrl+alt+F2 to drop to a command line and that works. In windows you can get information like manufacturer code, etc for unidentified devices. Is there anyway to do this in
2008-01-08T10:11:00.000Z	WinShade		the ubuntu command prompt so that I know which drivers i'm looking for?
2008-01-08T10:13:00.000Z	gyaresu	WinShade	You might find either the 'Alternative' (text based) or xubuntu better than the standard install if the machine is very low spec.
2008-01-08T10:15:00.000Z	gyaresu	WinShade	so go to the command prompt ctrl+alt+F2, login and from there you can type lspci to start with.

2008-01-08T10:20:00.000Z	gyaresu	WinShade	And did you run 'lspci'?
2008-01-08T10:21:00.000Z	gyaresu	WinShade	Yep.
2008-01-08T10:24:00.000Z	gyaresu	WinShade	Can you check that the BIOS has allocated enough memory to the video controler. You should be able to give it at least 32MB and 64MB if you've got enough RAM.

2008-01-08T10:31:00.000Z	WinShade	gyaresu	thank you, will check it out now
2008-01-08T10:36:00.000Z	WinShade	gyaresu	UMA Video Memory: 1 MB (something tells me that's pretty low)
2008-01-08T10:36:00.000Z	gyaresu	WinShade	:) I thinx I've foundz it!
2008-01-08T10:36:00.000Z	WinShade	gyaresu	?
2008-01-08T10:37:00.000Z	gyaresu	WinShade	If you've got 512MB ram then set it to 64MB or similar.
2008-01-08T10:38:00.000Z	WinShade	gyaresu	bios only allows me to go up to 8 MB
2008-01-08T10:42:00.000Z	gyaresu	WinShade	malnilion http://wiki.zenwalk.org/index.php?title=82845G/GL_Integrated_Graphics_Device That might help. Set VideoRam higher and get some proper res. Is it an LCD or CRT?
2008-01-08T10:43:00.000Z	gyaresu	WinShade	Can you edit files from the command line?
2008-01-08T10:45:00.000Z	gyaresu	WinShade	Cool. Then you could go to ctrl+alt+F2 and edit the (after backing up) /etc/X11/xorg.conf file
2008-01-08T10:54:00.000Z	gyaresu	WinShade	If you know what you did to fix it. Add it to the help.ubuntu.com wiki for others.
