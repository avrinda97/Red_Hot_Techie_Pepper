2009-06-05T02:30:00.000Z	mdm	mib_bmu46kso	there is no device manager, devices are part of the kernel, you want lshw and lsmod.  You can also see the devices conncted by bus as in lspci and lsusb (notice a theme here?)
2009-06-05T02:32:00.000Z	mdm	mib_bmu46kso	I already told you
2009-06-05T02:40:00.000Z	mdm	mib_bmu46kso	lshw, for the third time
2009-06-05T02:40:00.000Z	mib_bmu46kso	mdm	I already did it, but its just text...
2009-06-05T02:40:00.000Z	mdm	mib_bmu46kso	you do realize you don't have to ask the same question over and over, especially if you ignore the answers you are given, right?
2009-06-05T02:54:00.000Z	mdm	mib_bmu46kso	something is telling you that you have a network interface that understands 802.3
2009-06-05T02:56:00.000Z	mdm	mib_bmu46kso	http://www.google.com/search?q=802.3
2009-06-05T02:57:00.000Z	mdm	mib_bmu46kso	802.3 contains a bunch of protocols it is not a physical layer and not bluetooth
2009-06-05T02:59:00.000Z	mdm	mib_bmu46kso	physical layer of networking
