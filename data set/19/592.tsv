2011-12-05T00:53:00.000Z	batlock		like i want to copy data from the pc's hdd to the live usb
2011-12-05T00:53:00.000Z	batlock		where's it mounted
2011-12-05T00:54:00.000Z	batlock		the live usb
2011-12-05T00:55:00.000Z	batlock		THE usb that has been used to boot from
2011-12-05T00:56:00.000Z	batlock		dammit why can't anyone in here ever just know things, it seems the real keepers of information have all left this channel
2011-12-05T00:56:00.000Z	batlock		lol
2011-12-05T00:57:00.000Z	escott	batlock	and the internal hdd wont be mounted until you open it in nautilus
2011-12-05T01:08:00.000Z	escott	batlock	do you have a persistent usb
2011-12-05T01:10:00.000Z	escott	batlock	can you please !paste your entire mount output. also please confirm you made a persistent liveusb with usb-creator-gtk
2011-12-05T01:12:00.000Z	escott	batlock	its possible you created a non-persistent usb in which case you cannot save files on that usb stick. if you created a persistent on then you could try and put files in $HOME and see if they persist or try to find the fat32 partition and put files there. not sure what is preferred
2011-12-05T01:20:00.000Z	escott	batlock	bind the mountpoint to the mountpoint
2011-12-05T01:21:00.000Z	escott	batlock	you most likely dont have space for the metadata
2011-12-05T01:23:00.000Z	escott	batlock	how did you make this live usb?
2011-12-05T01:24:00.000Z	escott	batlock	i would just save something to $HOME and see if it is persisted
2011-12-05T01:24:00.000Z	escott	batlock	i dont know a thing about LILI, but that cow overlay is suggestive
2011-12-05T01:25:00.000Z	escott	batlock	that may not be possible. but you could boot the livecd and then copy from the livecd to windows
2011-12-05T01:26:00.000Z	escott	batlock	whether or not you can save to the fat32 partition underlying the usb depends on how lili configures stuff. we don't even know if there is a fat32 partition
2011-12-05T01:28:00.000Z	batlock	escott	thx that's probably what we're going to do
