2005-06-22T10:21:00.000Z	Otrayo		hi, can anyone tell me how to setup ubuntu so that i can ping the localhost/127.0.0.1
2005-06-22T10:21:00.000Z	bob2	Otrayo	it works out of the box
2005-06-22T10:21:00.000Z	bob2	Otrayo	did you enable a "firewall" or such?
2005-06-22T10:21:00.000Z	Otrayo	bob2	doesnt seem so...i can even ping the localhost, and i just did the default install
2005-06-22T10:22:00.000Z	bob2	Otrayo	paste the output of "ifconfig lo" to #flood
2005-06-22T10:24:00.000Z	Otrayo	bob2	do you mind waiting while i reconnect from my ubuntu notebook?
2005-06-22T10:24:00.000Z	bob2	Otrayo	no
2005-06-22T10:25:00.000Z	Otrayo	bob2	2 secs
2005-06-22T10:28:00.000Z	Otrayo	bob2	i was messing with settings before joining here...seems a restart did the trick, but tnx for being will to help anyway
2005-06-22T10:30:00.000Z	bob2	Otrayo	something somehow stopped the loopback interface from coming up, perhaps someone ctrl-c'd the network scripts at boot or something
2005-06-22T10:30:00.000Z	Otrayo	bob2	do you know anything about MySQL?
2005-06-22T10:31:00.000Z	bob2	Otrayo	enough to not use it ;p
2005-06-22T10:31:00.000Z	Otrayo	bob2	hehe...ok, i'll ask in open chan
2005-06-22T10:34:00.000Z	bob2	Otrayo	with the mysql client tool? mysql -h 1.2.3.4
2005-06-22T10:35:00.000Z	Otrayo	bob2	and if i wanna specify the database?
2005-06-22T10:35:00.000Z	bob2	Otrayo	same as you would on local host
2005-06-22T10:37:00.000Z	Otrayo	bob2	i'm troubleshooting a problem i'm having to connect to a MySQL database on the localhost via Java. I want to see if i can do it normally from the command line so that i can figure out whether the problem is with the database or my java coding...for java it would be jdbc:mysql://localhost/database
2005-06-22T10:37:00.000Z	Otrayo	bob2	what would it be from the command line
2005-06-22T10:39:00.000Z	bob2	Otrayo	mysql database
