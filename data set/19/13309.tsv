2009-02-27T13:04:00.000Z	gldtn	spike_	I got http://amadme.deviantart.com/art/T3K-103862094 to get rid of the message which also uses pixmap, but my title bar still doesn't look the same as his screenshot.. must need something else installed
2009-02-27T13:04:00.000Z	gldtn	spike_	but the others still give me the error
2009-02-27T13:05:00.000Z	spike_	gldtn	= / so nobody knows how to fix this problem
2009-02-27T13:06:00.000Z	spike_	gldtn	The theme is nice = ) do you use emerald ?
2009-02-27T13:09:00.000Z	gldtn	spike_	unfortunately not.. like I said I msged the creater of the theme, lets see if I get lucky and get an answer.. do you have msn?
2009-02-27T13:10:00.000Z	spike_	gldtn	Yes I have
2009-02-27T13:13:00.000Z	gldtn	spike_	that might be our issue
2009-02-27T13:14:00.000Z	spike_	gldtn	maybe
2009-02-27T13:16:00.000Z	spike_	gldtn	I have emerald but it doesn't work too for me ...

2009-02-27T13:22:00.000Z	spike_	gldtn	crdlb: I change the command line in compiz, I need to restart, I be back
2009-02-27T13:26:00.000Z	spike_	gldtn	Emerald works !
2009-02-27T13:32:00.000Z	gldtn	spike_	it does work.. but it still gives a problem.. but from some reading I did it can be ignored
