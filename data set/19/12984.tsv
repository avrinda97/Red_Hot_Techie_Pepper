2005-06-01T14:17:00.000Z	mikekgr		hello friends. I am tried the latest ubuntu live cd (5.04) on my Fujitsu-Siemens Amilo-A laptop but when th X server tried to start my system freezed. Any suggestion ???
2005-06-01T14:19:00.000Z	malign-traps	mikekgr	Not really.  Is the keyboard completely unresponsive?  Do you have another computer nearby on the same network?
2005-06-01T14:22:00.000Z	mikekgr	malign-traps	I am very sure it freezed completelly...
2005-06-01T14:23:00.000Z	malign-traps	mikekgr	There are two kinds of problems it could be:  A kernel panic/hang, or a console hang.  We need first to fiure out which it is.  Do you have another computer nearby on the same network?
2005-06-01T14:25:00.000Z	mikekgr	malign-traps	The problem appeared not in the booting but when the system tried to activate the X.org server ... and yes it hangs
2005-06-01T14:25:00.000Z	malign-traps	mikekgr	Do you have another computer nearby on the same network?
2005-06-01T14:26:00.000Z	mikekgr	malign-traps	no
2005-06-01T14:28:00.000Z	mikekgr	malign-traps	it is not possible to change to any console (alt+ctrl+F1) not possible to kill X server nor alt+ctrl+del ...
2005-06-01T14:28:00.000Z	malign-traps	mikekgr	 Yes.  That doesn't tell us whether the console is hung or whether the kernel is hung.
2005-06-01T14:30:00.000Z	malign-traps	mikekgr	 Best plan:  Boot the CD without X, from one console, "while sleep 1; do echo ^G; done" .  From another, start X.  If the beeping stops, then it's the kernel.
2005-06-01T14:30:00.000Z	mikekgr	malign-traps	the only sure is that knoppix 3.8.1 / 3.8.2 or older boots and run X server without any problem ... Why ubuntu not ???
2005-06-01T14:31:00.000Z	malign-traps	mikekgr	It has more vowels.  How the heck should I know.  Do you want to find out why, or mull over that it doesn't work?
2005-06-01T14:32:00.000Z	mikekgr	malign-traps	how can boot without X server please explain
2005-06-01T14:34:00.000Z	malign-traps	mikekgr	When the CD first starts to load, it prompts you for various schemes.  Choose the one that says something like "No GUI."
2005-06-01T14:36:00.000Z	mikekgr	malign-traps	OK I dont remember that but I will boot it once again to see it one more time BUT I did not remember any selection or cheat code like this...
2005-06-01T14:36:00.000Z	malign-traps	mikekgr	I'm pretty sure it's there.  Did you get what I said to do with the echo-control-Gs?
2005-06-01T14:37:00.000Z	mikekgr	malign-traps	sait it one more time please  "echo-control-Gs?"
2005-06-01T14:37:00.000Z	malign-traps	mikekgr	 Best plan:  Boot the CD without X, from one console, "while sleep 1; do echo ^G; done" .  From another, start X.  If the beeping stops, then it's the kernel.
2005-06-01T14:38:00.000Z	mikekgr	malign-traps	OK thanks, I will try it.
