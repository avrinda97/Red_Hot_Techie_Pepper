2005-01-02T16:15:00.000Z	Rohan		how do you tell apt-get to go and meet all dependencies for a package?
2005-01-02T16:16:00.000Z	Rohan		thats what i thought.. but sometimes it will say that blabla will not be installed
2005-01-02T16:17:00.000Z	ogra	Rohan	so something in your sources.list is wrong, or your package lists are not up to date
2005-01-02T16:17:00.000Z	ogra	Rohan	what do you try to install ?
2005-01-02T16:18:00.000Z	ogra	Rohan	hmm, there is a official upgrade guide on the wiki
2005-01-02T16:18:00.000Z	ogra	Rohan	nd removed the sarge sources i hope
2005-01-02T16:19:00.000Z	ogra	Rohan	you also did apt-get update ?
2005-01-02T16:20:00.000Z	ogra	Rohan	hmm, pciutils       2.1.11-11
2005-01-02T16:23:00.000Z	ogra	Rohan	thats not good, dont mix ubuntu and debian
2005-01-02T16:25:00.000Z	ogra	Rohan	ubuntu/warty is to old for sid
2005-01-02T16:26:00.000Z	ogra	Rohan	this will certainly break ... if  not now, then on one of the next upgrades
2005-01-02T16:27:00.000Z	ogra	Rohan	seen this ? https://www.ubuntulinux.org/support/documentation/faq/upgrade-sarge
2005-01-02T16:28:00.000Z	ogra	Rohan	you can do sarge to hoary (unstable)
2005-01-02T16:29:00.000Z	ogra	Rohan	but unstable means unstable ..... its a bit like debian unstable with experimental
2005-01-02T16:29:00.000Z	ogra	Rohan	drop sid there
2005-01-02T16:30:00.000Z	ogra	Rohan	then everything gets updated...you can be sure that between sarge and hoary all the versions are newer
2005-01-02T16:40:00.000Z	ogra	Rohan	256 are a requirement with gnome desktop
2005-01-02T16:40:00.000Z	ogra	Rohan	else it will swap
2005-01-02T16:41:00.000Z	ogra	Rohan	but this applys for the newer gnome .... with 2.0 128 was enough
