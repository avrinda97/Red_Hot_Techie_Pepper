2009-11-25T01:58:00.000Z	null_kuhl		hello, need help with xorg,  i installed nvidia drivers manually ver 190 and now after rebooting i can only see a black screen, no response to watever keys, however i can reach console from recovery mode, am using ubuntu 9.04 beta, please advice..
2009-11-25T01:59:00.000Z	Slart	null_kuhl	9.04 beta?
2009-11-25T01:59:00.000Z	null_kuhl	Slart	: yes
2009-11-25T01:59:00.000Z	null_kuhl	Slart	its a karmic beta
2009-11-25T01:59:00.000Z	Slart	null_kuhl	why on earth would you use a beta for a 6 month old os?
2009-11-25T02:00:00.000Z	Slart	null_kuhl	oh.. a karmic beta.. 9.10 you mean then.. but nevermind
2009-11-25T02:00:00.000Z	null_kuhl	Slart	yes sorry
2009-11-25T02:00:00.000Z	Slart	null_kuhl	download the new driver from the nvidia site.. go to the recovery console.. run telinit 3 then sudo sh NVIDIA_blablabla
2009-11-25T02:01:00.000Z	Slart	null_kuhl	basically install the nvidia driver again.. that fixed the problem for me.. I had the same issue
2009-11-25T02:01:00.000Z	Slart	null_kuhl	the "telinit 3" is just to get to runlevel 3.. not sure if that is needed but the nvidia installer complained about it
2009-11-25T02:02:00.000Z	null_kuhl	Slart	urgh so now am on console what to do ?
2009-11-25T02:02:00.000Z	Slart	null_kuhl	do you have the nvidia driver downloaded?
2009-11-25T02:03:00.000Z	Slart	null_kuhl	oh.. you've tried reinstalling it already?.. hmmm.
2009-11-25T02:03:00.000Z	null_kuhl	Slart	no no, look , i had restricted driver enabled and working ok ?
2009-11-25T02:04:00.000Z	null_kuhl	Slart	but it was version 18x and i wanted 190, so i manually downloaded 190 off nvidia website as a .run file , closed X and installed it then rebooted and ended up with a black screen
2009-11-25T02:05:00.000Z	Slart	null_kuhl	oh.. ok.. so the 190 driver didn't work for you at all.. well.. hang on.. let's try installing the one from the repos again then
2009-11-25T02:06:00.000Z	Slart	null_kuhl	try running this "sudo apt-get install --reinstall nvidia-glx-185"
2009-11-25T02:06:00.000Z	Slart	null_kuhl	hopefully it will get you back to 185 .. and hopefully that works better than 190
2009-11-25T02:07:00.000Z	null_kuhl	Slart	actually i wanted to use 190 for development purposes on that nvidia card i have, and nvidia sdk requires ver 190, incase i get back now to a working 185 , any idea what should i do to get a working 190 :)
