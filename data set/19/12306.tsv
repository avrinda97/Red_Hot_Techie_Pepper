2005-11-21T15:25:00.000Z	zxsykco		How do I calculate 0000:02:0a.0 to deciaml? It's looks like a funny number to me!
2005-11-21T15:26:00.000Z	zxsykco		binary I understand, hexidecimal......
2005-11-21T15:27:00.000Z	zxsykco		Does anyone know what 0000:02:0a.0 is in deciaml?
2005-11-21T15:29:00.000Z	zxsykco		I do not know how to convert hexidecimal to decimal, I need to know what 0000:02:0a.0 is in decimal, would someone mind helping me understand?
2005-11-21T15:30:00.000Z	zxsykco		This is why I hate linux.
2005-11-21T15:31:00.000Z	zxsykco		Where is what from?
2005-11-21T15:31:00.000Z	zxsykco		It is a bus Id location for my ati graphics card.
2005-11-21T15:32:00.000Z	zxsykco		The dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg asks for the location of the graphics card.
2005-11-21T15:32:00.000Z	zxsykco		lspci -v says it is located at 0000:02:0a.0
2005-11-21T15:32:00.000Z	onkarshinde	zxsykco	what is output of lspci? It will be normnally 1:0:0
2005-11-21T15:33:00.000Z	onkarshinde	zxsykco	Do you have more than one cards? Or an AGP?
2005-11-21T15:34:00.000Z	onkarshinde	zxsykco	Can you paste output of lspci in pastebin?
2005-11-21T15:39:00.000Z	zxsykco	onkarshinde	here is the link http://pastebin.com/431414 thank you for your assistance! ^_^
2005-11-21T15:40:00.000Z	onkarshinde	zxsykco	I don't think this is output of 'lspci' I have same card and never seen anything like this on lspci
2005-11-21T15:40:00.000Z	onkarshinde	zxsykco	Ok. Then paste output of just 'lspci'

2005-11-21T15:43:00.000Z	onkarshinde	zxsykco	This is ridiculously different than what I see. What version of Ubuntu are you using?
2005-11-21T16:23:00.000Z	onkarshinde	zxsykco	It won't and if it does you will be too busy buying new PC to come here.
