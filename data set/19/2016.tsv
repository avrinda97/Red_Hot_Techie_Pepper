2010-07-31T17:24:00.000Z	Putr		hi! I used samba to connect to a win7 computer... it worked fine, but today it all of a sudden does not work anymore (the connection ubuntu->win times out, other way is fine)
2010-07-31T17:24:00.000Z	Putr		what could be the culprit?
2010-07-31T17:25:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Putr	 you are refering to windows 'shares' ?
2010-07-31T17:25:00.000Z	Putr	Dr_Willis	i connect: smb:\\computer_name\
2010-07-31T17:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Putr	 try using the ip# instead of the name
2010-07-31T17:27:00.000Z	Putr	Dr_Willis	Ok i'll try that
2010-07-31T17:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Putr	 'smb' = samba = how windows does 'shares'
2010-07-31T17:28:00.000Z	Putr	Dr_Willis	Your a genious :D
2010-07-31T17:28:00.000Z	Putr	Dr_Willis	it works
2010-09-07T17:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Putr	 mine do spin down. theres a setting in the power saveeings  control applet to handle it.
2010-09-07T17:16:00.000Z	Putr	Dr_Willis	thanks, i'll check it out
2010-09-07T17:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Putr	 they can take a few sec to spin back up if i access them. Which can be a bother.
2010-09-07T17:17:00.000Z	Putr	Dr_Willis	ye but but if they're running for hours and hours and spining.. that cant bee good for them. I use it for long termn storage, i will not die if they take a few secs to spiin up
2011-01-08T23:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Putr	 dont work where?
2011-01-08T23:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Putr	 well yes.. in 'ubuntu' but you mean in IRC? in terminal? in console? in vi/emacs/whatever?
2011-01-08T23:46:00.000Z	Putr	Dr_Willis	I mean .. EVERYWHERE
2011-01-08T23:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Putr	 double check in the console.
2011-01-08T23:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Putr	 if 'compiz' is to blame. then the keys should work in the alt-ctrl0f1 through f6 consoles.
2011-01-08T23:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Putr	 also you could try installing a simple window manager like 'icewm' and seeif it works in there. If so. that would point to a gnome/compiz setting/issue.
