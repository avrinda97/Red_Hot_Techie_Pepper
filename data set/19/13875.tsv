2004-12-26T15:58:00.000Z	thully	monoxide	check your sound volume - it may be muted by default
2004-12-26T16:00:00.000Z	monoxide		it says enable sound server startup and its ticked
2004-12-26T16:00:00.000Z	thully	monoxide	You want "PCM" up to about 2/3 (in Volume Control-Playback) and Volume and CD to about the same (in Volume Control-Capture)
2004-12-26T16:01:00.000Z	monoxide	thully	its on 100%
2004-12-26T16:01:00.000Z	thully		Nothing important - at least on standard setups
2004-12-26T16:01:00.000Z	thully		Is PCM up also?
2004-12-26T16:02:00.000Z	monoxide		pardon thully?
2004-12-26T16:02:00.000Z	thully	monoxide	what is your "PCM" volume level
2004-12-26T16:02:00.000Z	thully	monoxide	 What about the master volume, and CD?
