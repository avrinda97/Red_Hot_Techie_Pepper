2009-04-19T08:23:00.000Z	Artelus		Hey
2009-04-19T08:23:00.000Z	Artelus		how do you mount something from the filesystem?
2009-04-19T08:23:00.000Z	Artelus		-Using the command line?
2009-04-19T08:24:00.000Z	Artelus		Well...I'm using Fluxbox, but in order to access my windows partition I have to log off and log into Gnome, and I don't want to do that
2009-04-19T08:24:00.000Z	Artelus		Is there a way to mount a USB device with a command?
2009-04-19T08:25:00.000Z	Artelus		My windows partition is NFTS
2009-04-19T08:26:00.000Z	Artelus		I can mount automacally, using GNOME, but Fluxbox doesn't do it
2009-04-19T08:26:00.000Z	usser	Artelus	sudo ntfs-3g /dev/[windows partition] /mountpoint
2009-04-19T08:28:00.000Z	usser	Artelus	sudo fdisk -l to get a list of your partitions
2009-04-19T08:29:00.000Z	usser	Artelus	cameras are tricky some of them are not mass storage device and you cant mount them
2009-04-19T08:30:00.000Z	usser	Artelus	use something like digikam or fspot on gnome to get access to a camera
2009-04-19T08:30:00.000Z	Artelus	usser	Gnome auto detects AND connects to the camera
2009-04-19T08:31:00.000Z	Artelus	usser	It just doesn't work while I'm on another program, like Fluxbox or XFCE
2009-04-19T08:31:00.000Z	usser	Artelus	gnome does a LOT of magic you cant expect a windows manager like fluxbox to do stuff that a full featured Desktop environment does
2009-05-14T07:19:00.000Z	usser	Artelus	you dont need to install java manually
2009-05-14T07:19:00.000Z	usser	Artelus	sudo apt-get install sun-java6-plugin
2009-05-14T07:19:00.000Z	usser	Artelus	^
2009-05-14T07:19:00.000Z	usser	Artelus	java-plugin installed too?
2009-05-14T07:20:00.000Z	usser	Artelus	thats a secret
