2010-05-02T16:10:00.000Z	Sp0t		I tried several ports, portforwarded these ports, tried many things
2010-05-02T16:10:00.000Z	Sp0t		xchat just won't connect where smuxi and pidgin have no problem
2010-05-02T16:11:00.000Z	Ken8521	Sp0t	that suggests a setup error.
2010-05-02T16:12:00.000Z	Sp0t	Ken8521	I copied the settings from a working client and still no go
2010-05-02T16:12:00.000Z	Ken8521	Sp0t	have you been playing w/ iptables or your router/
2010-05-02T16:13:00.000Z	Sp0t	Ken8521	my laptop has a fixed ip from the router
2010-05-02T16:14:00.000Z	Ken8521	Sp0t	well, that doesn't really matter... so does mine... did you set up some rules in your router, that might be blocking your laptop?
2010-05-02T16:14:00.000Z	Sp0t	Ken8521	not really
2010-05-02T16:14:00.000Z	Ken8521	Sp0t	not really or no?
2010-05-02T16:15:00.000Z	Ken8521	Sp0t	do you have a live cd?
2010-05-02T16:16:00.000Z	Ken8521	Sp0t	well thats fine.. is it a Live USB?.. youcan boot it, surf the internet, etc?
2010-05-02T16:17:00.000Z	Ken8521	Sp0t	boot the USB, and install xchat on it, and see if youcan get here from the live USB... if you can, you know it's something you've wonked around w/ on your install, if you can't, it's a setting in your router
2010-05-02T16:17:00.000Z	Sp0t	Ken8521	thanks for the info, I will give that a go one time
2010-05-02T16:18:00.000Z	Ken8521	Sp0t	that will at least isolate the problem.
2010-05-02T16:18:00.000Z	Sp0t	Ken8521	yes
2010-05-02T16:18:00.000Z	Sp0t	Ken8521	but I still find it strange that Pidgin and Smuxi work right out the box and xchat did not
2010-05-02T16:19:00.000Z	Ken8521	Sp0t	they may just be looking at different ports, and one is blocked in your router(or via iptables)
2010-05-02T16:19:00.000Z	Sp0t	Ken8521	I tried many ports
2010-05-02T16:20:00.000Z	Sp0t	Ken8521	will try the stick one time and let you know when I see you again
