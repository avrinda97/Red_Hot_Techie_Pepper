2004-09-24T10:53:00.000Z	jblack		fabbioone: I'm doing dual-head tonight! 
2004-09-24T10:54:00.000Z	fabbione	jblack	it won't be aoutdetected, but if you need a working config i have one for you :-)
2004-09-24T10:54:00.000Z	fabbione	jblack	and dual head rocks !
2004-09-24T10:56:00.000Z	fabbione	jblack	extended desktop you need xinerama
2004-09-24T10:56:00.000Z	fabbione	jblack	for the resolution can you check Horiz/Vert freq?
2004-09-24T10:56:00.000Z	fabbione	jblack	nope.. xinerama needs to be enabled
2004-09-24T10:56:00.000Z	fabbione	jblack	in the config file
2004-09-24T10:57:00.000Z	fabbione	jblack	i can't remember how to enable xinerama.. just a sec that i will RTFM
2004-09-24T11:05:00.000Z	fabbione	jblack	it would be the same for me towards RCS :-)
2004-09-24T11:11:00.000Z	fabbione	jblack	can you check in /var/log/XFree86.0.log how much ram do you have on the board?
2004-09-24T11:13:00.000Z	fabbione	jblack	with 32MB of ram you are lucky you can do dual head :-))))
2004-09-24T11:14:00.000Z	fabbione	jblack	yes.
2004-09-24T11:14:00.000Z	fabbione	jblack	if you believe to have more ram you can force it
2004-09-24T11:15:00.000Z	fabbione	jblack	you need to check the video card specs on google :-)
2004-09-24T11:18:00.000Z	fabbione	jblack	where value is expressed in kB
2004-09-24T11:18:00.000Z	fabbione	jblack	well for the sake of it you should push it to 24bit :-)))
2004-09-24T11:19:00.000Z	fabbione	jblack	it would possibly crash
2004-09-24T11:33:00.000Z	fabbione	jblack	yes.. i realized it a sec after you left
2004-09-24T11:33:00.000Z	fabbione	jblack	64 Mb of ram is detected correctly. 2 heads = 32Mb of ram each
