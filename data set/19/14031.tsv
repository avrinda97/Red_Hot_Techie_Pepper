2005-07-01T09:54:00.000Z	SogniX		how do I get ubuntu to detect my video card? I installed a new video card and now I can't get into X :(
2005-07-01T09:55:00.000Z	SogniX		it was an integrated one...
2005-07-01T09:55:00.000Z	niran	SogniX	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2005-07-01T09:55:00.000Z	niran		i think.
2005-07-01T09:57:00.000Z	SogniX		it's asking me about the bus identifier for it - showing:  PCI:1:0:0
2005-07-01T09:57:00.000Z	SogniX		but I have an AGP one
2005-07-01T09:57:00.000Z	SogniX		I enter AGP and it complained :/
2005-07-01T09:57:00.000Z	SogniX	gm78	- I didn't buy it, I already had it in anothoer computer. :p  nvidia :)
2005-07-01T09:59:00.000Z	niran	SogniX	type lspci
2005-07-01T09:59:00.000Z	niran	SogniX	find the right card, and use that address
2005-07-01T10:00:00.000Z	niran	SogniX	the address is in hex, but X wants it in decimal
2005-07-01T10:00:00.000Z	niran	SogniX	so make sure you convert it
2005-07-01T10:01:00.000Z	niran		configuring a new graphics card shouldn't be this hard.
2005-07-01T10:01:00.000Z	SogniX		X is starting! :D
2005-07-01T10:01:00.000Z	niran		awesome.
2005-07-01T10:01:00.000Z	SogniX		thanks
2005-07-01T10:01:00.000Z	niran		no proble,
2005-07-01T10:01:00.000Z	niran		m
2005-07-01T10:02:00.000Z	niran	SogniX	if it's an nvidia card and you want 3D, install the nvidia drivers
