2010-11-17T10:58:00.000Z	clu3		my downloaded  .iso has correct checksum and i've successfully burned to a CD but when i try to install it, i see the ubuntu trademark for a while before i see the error: "can not mount /dev/loop0" > I googled but found no answer yet. Someone pls help me?
2010-11-17T10:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	clu3	did you check the CD for defects once first booted to?
2010-11-17T10:59:00.000Z	clu3	ActionParsnip	sorry, what do you mean by CD defects?
2010-11-17T11:00:00.000Z	clu3	ActionParsnip	the full error is "Can not mount /dev/loop0 (/cdrom/casper/filesystem.squashfs) on //filesystem.squashfs"
2010-11-17T11:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	clu3	when you boot to the CD you can tell the CD to test itself to see if the burn process was ok, on the same screen you can also test ram. When you start booting the CD pres SPACEBAR and the old school Ubuntu boot screen will show, you should check both
2010-11-17T11:01:00.000Z	clu3	ActionParsnip	thans, I'll check that. back in a min
2010-11-17T11:07:00.000Z	clu3	ActionParsnip	when i choose "Check CD defects"  menu option, i see a blackscreen fora while, and then it goes to the Ubuntu trademark and later on the error as above. Sounds like the CD is ok?
2010-11-17T11:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	clu3	you will be told if its ok on screen in words :)
2010-11-17T11:10:00.000Z	clu3	ActionParsnip	uhm.. this one doesn't sayanything, just goes straight to the install process i think...weird
2011-04-25T10:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	clu3	if you need the extra features in the sun java, use sun
2012-02-09T07:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	clu3	11.10 or 11.04?
2012-02-09T07:24:00.000Z	clu3	ActionParsnip	11.04
2012-02-09T07:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	clu3	http://askubuntu.com/questions/66914/how-to-change-desktop-background-from-command-line-in-unity   try that
2012-02-09T07:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	clu3	not sure if natty uses some gnome3 stuffs
2012-02-09T07:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	clu3	you REALLY need to start adding the full versions. There is no ubuntu 10, there is 10.04 and 10.10
2012-02-09T07:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	clu3	seems to have moved over, could make it into a script. Something like 'setwallpaper' ;)
2012-02-09T07:40:00.000Z	clu3	ActionParsnip	yep, i am actually running it as a script to add my todolist to the desktop background, everytime i start my day. https://github.com/clu3/ubuntu-desktop-todo-list ^^
2012-02-09T07:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	clu3	nice, I have similar but its a post install script called: dostuff
2012-02-09T07:44:00.000Z	clu3	ActionParsnip	nice. i find todolist in the background image so much easier than opening another todolist app
