2012-05-17T18:26:00.000Z	obscurant1st		Is there any possible way to put something on the clipbord? I have coded a script to take screenshot and upload it into the imgur.com service then return the uploaded url. But I need to put that url into the clipboard, for that I just need the linux command! :/
2012-05-17T18:28:00.000Z	wwd	obscurant1st	 xclip
2012-05-17T18:29:00.000Z	obscurant1st		wwwd, I tried that without success. I mean I have a variable with the url, and I don't know any wayof of passing that into xclip. Can you show me How to put "foo" onto clipboard using xclip?
2012-05-17T18:29:00.000Z	wwd		pipe it
2012-05-17T18:31:00.000Z	obscurant1st	wwd	Yep I tried that, somehwo tis not working in python, may be I need some other solution.
2012-05-17T18:32:00.000Z	wwd		can you get xclip to work in bash?
2012-05-17T18:33:00.000Z	obscurant1st		echo yahoo | xclip -selection c
