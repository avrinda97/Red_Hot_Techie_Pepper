2009-04-21T12:01:00.000Z	AK_Dave	loquitus_of_bor1	edit your /etc/apt/sources.list
2009-04-21T12:37:00.000Z	AK_Dave	loquitus_of_bor1	Did you enable -proposed and -backports ??
2009-04-21T12:38:00.000Z	loquitus_of_bor1	AK_Dave	yes
2009-04-21T12:38:00.000Z	AK_Dave	loquitus_of_bor1	did you apt-get update ??
2009-04-21T12:38:00.000Z	loquitus_of_bor1	AK_Dave	doin it from the command line to be sure. the software sources thing did to some sort of update
2009-04-21T12:41:00.000Z	loquitus_of_bor1	AK_Dave	ok sudo apt-get update done... it did not seem to do much
2009-04-21T12:41:00.000Z	AK_Dave	loquitus_of_bor1	Before you try this "new kernel" route, which seems dubious for your problem, have you considered that the audio driver may just be locked? A simple 'modprobe -r [module] && modprobe [module]' will probably fix it.
2009-04-21T12:42:00.000Z	loquitus_of_bor1	AK_Dave	I rebooted the machine and even tried reinstalling the driver... so would your solution matter?
2009-04-21T12:42:00.000Z	AK_Dave	loquitus_of_bor1	It won't hurt, and often works.
2009-04-21T12:44:00.000Z	AK_Dave	loquitus_of_bor1	But if you're intent on the "new kernel" route, I gave you a full commandline to cut-paste: 'sudo apt-get update -f && sudo apt-get upgrade -y && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade'
2009-04-21T12:44:00.000Z	loquitus_of_bor1	AK_Dave	assuming that does not work, how do I install additional kernels so that I can try to boot these on startup?
2009-04-21T12:47:00.000Z	loquitus_of_bor1	AK_Dave	did those commands by the way... no difference...
2009-04-21T12:48:00.000Z	AK_Dave	loquitus_of_bor1	was there anything upgraded by those commands?
2009-04-21T12:48:00.000Z	loquitus_of_bor1	AK_Dave	no... I guess I should mention I am in Jaunty... my bad.
2009-04-21T12:48:00.000Z	AK_Dave	loquitus_of_bor1	Yeah, your bad. Wrong channel.
2009-04-21T12:50:00.000Z	AK_Dave	loquitus_of_bor1	There are NO proposed for Jaunty at this point, as the software is not yet released. Anything that would be proposed, goes main. And since it isn't release, there is nothing being backported to it either as Karmic isn't far enough along to backport out of.
2009-04-21T12:51:00.000Z	loquitus_of_bor1	AK_Dave	I wonder if my sound card not working issue is just some bug that is resolved in Jaunty
2009-04-21T12:51:00.000Z	AK_Dave	loquitus_of_bor1	Since you now fess to using Jaunty, I think we have to guess that your random audio outage is some random regression that happened with an upgrade at some point. Maybe you should report a bug.
2009-04-21T12:51:00.000Z	loquitus_of_bor1	AK_Dave	yes... my thoughts too
