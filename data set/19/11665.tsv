2005-12-14T13:10:00.000Z	Lewix		I've downloaded the dvd iso of ubuntu,burn and check the image with md5sum, boot my laptop toshiba M45-S169 with it but when I type enter , it loads up some files and the screen goes black. I've been trying to find a solution for 4days now but nobody came with a solution,even in forums (I'm a newbie)
