2008-02-19T22:34:00.000Z	xyblor		How do I force X to use the PreferredMode on one of my dual-head displays? (Radeon 8500, Ubuntu 7.10)
2008-02-19T22:36:00.000Z	xyblor		Why isn't X using the preferred resolution reported by my monitor?
2008-02-19T22:37:00.000Z	id10t	xyblor	not defined in your xorg.conf file?
2008-02-19T22:37:00.000Z	xyblor	id10t	defining it in xorg.conf doesn't help
2008-02-19T22:38:00.000Z	xyblor	id10t	it's the preferred mode to begin with, so why wouldn't X use it?
2008-02-19T22:38:00.000Z	id10t	xyblor	maybe not right refresh rate, etc. so it fails over to next mode?
2008-02-19T22:38:00.000Z	xyblor	id10t	no, I can switch to the preferred mode with Xrandr no problem, even using --auto
2008-02-19T22:39:00.000Z	id10t	xyblor	can you switch to that res. using the ctrl+alt and plus/minus keys?
2008-02-19T22:39:00.000Z	xyblor	id10t	X just doesn't want to start with that mode for some reason
2008-02-19T22:39:00.000Z	xyblor	id10t	I'll try
2008-02-19T22:40:00.000Z	id10t		need some quick help... recently got a new machine, moved my ubuntu hd to it and everything works except sound... sound works fine on the new box with the live cd, how can i get the system to reconfigure the sound?
2008-02-19T22:41:00.000Z	xyblor	id10t	a common problem seems to be ALSA using the wrong sound card, like the internal one
2008-02-19T22:42:00.000Z	id10t	xyblor	this is the internal card... same basic chipset as the old one (intel 8x0) but old machine was a Dell GX270 and new box is a kick butt HP workstation
2008-02-19T22:43:00.000Z	xyblor	id10t	asoundconf might help
2008-02-19T22:43:00.000Z	xyblor	id10t	does "asoundconf list" look right?
2008-02-19T22:43:00.000Z	id10t	xyblor	no cards found...
2008-02-19T22:43:00.000Z	id10t	xyblor	think i'll just boot the live cd and see what modules are loaded
2008-02-19T22:44:00.000Z	xyblor	id10t	yeah, it must be serious...
2008-02-19T22:44:00.000Z	xyblor	id10t	maybe it's looking for a card in the wrong PCI slot?
