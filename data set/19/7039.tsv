2007-10-20T05:45:00.000Z	JensenDied		so, compiz seems to be eating part of my screen...
2007-10-20T05:45:00.000Z	kibble	JensenDied	how so?
2007-10-20T05:46:00.000Z	JensenDied	kibble	well, my screen size that is started with X is a bit smaller than i like, so i have xrandr resize it, however everything not in that initial size doesnt display, background, menubar etc... since the update
2007-10-20T05:47:00.000Z	kibble	JensenDied	so they aren't on the screen at all?
2007-10-20T05:48:00.000Z	JensenDied	kibble	its probably due to some of the missing compiz-fusion stuff in the default im gonna try a few more things first, just kinda wierd
2007-10-20T05:49:00.000Z	kibble	JensenDied	I have a 950 gma or something and run at 1280x800, X new it was bigger then 1024x768 but for some reason wasn't telling gnome, I was hoping that;s what you meant because I solved that
2007-10-20T05:50:00.000Z	JensenDied	kibble	well thats not what i meant to be talking about, but while were there, how did you solve that since that something else ive been putting off fixing?
2007-10-20T05:50:00.000Z	kibble	JensenDied	I assume an intel video then? yeah I found a web site that had the fix, lemme find it
2007-10-20T05:51:00.000Z	JensenDied	kibble	well this is an nvidia card on this machine, but its probably a similar issue
2007-10-20T05:54:00.000Z	kibble	JensenDied	give this a shot http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Installing_Ubuntu_7.10_(Gutsy_Gibbon)_Tribe_on_a_ThinkPad_R61
2007-10-20T05:54:00.000Z	JensenDied	kibble	thanks for finding that
2007-10-20T05:56:00.000Z	JensenDied	kibble	well i just finised installing the compiz-kde package, seems to have had stuff not included in the base meta package i needed, still checking out the article though
2007-10-20T05:57:00.000Z	kibble	JensenDied	it lists a bunch of other stuff, but the part about the screen bug fixed is the section I was pointing at
2007-10-20T06:18:00.000Z	JensenDied	kibble	bah, garbage. they really need to stop changing defaults every release. im  gonna deal with apache2.2 crud first
2007-10-20T06:19:00.000Z	kibble	JensenDied	I've been upgrading to 7.10 since tribe1, haven't really had too much trouble yet
2007-10-20T06:20:00.000Z	JensenDied	kibble	any idea where they threw the compiz config stuff?
2007-10-20T06:21:00.000Z	kibble	JensenDied	gnome-compiz-manager or something, it's been pasted a few times
2007-10-20T06:22:00.000Z	JensenDied	kibble	alright, one would think compiz-manager-gnome since thats the package name
2007-10-20T06:22:00.000Z	kibble	JensenDied	hence I said or something
