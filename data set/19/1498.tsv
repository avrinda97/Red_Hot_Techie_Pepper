2011-09-04T22:04:00.000Z	hareldvd		Even though the numlock is on numeric keyboard does the arrows. Any idea? ( It's a laptop on a docking station.)
2011-09-04T22:05:00.000Z	BarkingFish	hareldvd	sometimes there's a problem with reversed leds
2011-09-04T22:09:00.000Z	hareldvd	BarkingFish	didn't help. Any more ideas?
2011-09-04T22:09:00.000Z	BarkingFish	hareldvd	which laptop do you have?
2011-09-04T22:12:00.000Z	BarkingFish	hareldvd	from the looks of that laptop, the numeric keyboard is built in to the regular keyboard, not as a seperate pad, right?
2011-09-04T22:13:00.000Z	hareldvd	BarkingFish	Yea, however I use a docking station to which a regular keyboard is attached.
2011-09-04T22:15:00.000Z	hareldvd	BarkingFish	I think I use qwerty 105 how can I verify?
2011-09-04T22:15:00.000Z	BarkingFish	hareldvd	does it have a QWERTY layout and a seperate number pad to the right?
2011-09-04T22:16:00.000Z	hareldvd	BarkingFish	Sorry I thought you refered to configuration.
2011-09-04T22:17:00.000Z	BarkingFish	hareldvd	the layout on your laptop and the keyboard on the docking station are most likely mismatched.  It sounds to me like the laptop is interpreting the keypresses as being on its own keymap (for the laptop keyboard) rather than the keymap for the one you have plugged in.
2011-09-04T22:17:00.000Z	hareldvd	BarkingFish	mongy I still use 10.04
2011-09-04T22:18:00.000Z	hareldvd	BarkingFish	Interesting. Any tip how to cure this problem?
2011-09-04T22:19:00.000Z	BarkingFish	hareldvd	try looking at what ubottu just posted up, that may be what you need
2011-09-04T22:20:00.000Z	hareldvd	BarkingFish	Didn't find any settings for the different keyboards.
2011-09-04T22:23:00.000Z	hareldvd	BarkingFish	Nothing.
2011-09-04T22:24:00.000Z	BarkingFish	hareldvd	I guess I'm gonna have to turn you over to the ubuntuites then :)  I'm sorry I've not been able to help you.
2011-09-04T22:28:00.000Z	hareldvd	BarkingFish	Thanks.
2011-09-04T22:30:00.000Z	hareldvd	BarkingFish	When I say guys. Do they really listen?
2011-09-04T22:38:00.000Z	hareldvd	BarkingFish	Thanks.
