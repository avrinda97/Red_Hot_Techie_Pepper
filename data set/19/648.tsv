2012-01-26T12:13:00.000Z	BigTaxi		i'm currently just trying to figure out what numbers i put in for the subnet.. after my IP
2012-01-26T12:14:00.000Z	genewitch	BigTaxi	for your ISP or local network
2012-01-26T12:15:00.000Z	genewitch	BigTaxi	the IP you typed in, does it start with 10, 172, or 192, or none of the above
2012-01-26T12:16:00.000Z	genewitch	BigTaxi	then you shouldn't be typing in the subnet unless your ISP assigned you a static address
2012-01-26T12:16:00.000Z	genewitch	BigTaxi	does it start with 209/
2012-01-26T12:17:00.000Z	genewitch	BigTaxi	type ifconfig |grep inet
2012-01-26T12:17:00.000Z	genewitch	BigTaxi	does it say anything about 209 in there or is it 192.168.x.x
2012-01-26T12:18:00.000Z	genewitch	BigTaxi	it's strange that you're connected directly to the network. you see that next thing where it says broadcast address?
2012-01-26T12:19:00.000Z	genewitch	BigTaxi	type ifconfig
2012-01-26T12:20:00.000Z	genewitch	BigTaxi	i missed what exactly you were trying to do, what are you trying to do
2012-01-26T12:21:00.000Z	genewitch	BigTaxi	wireless as in like cellular modem?
2012-01-26T12:22:00.000Z	genewitch	BigTaxi	use networkmanager. you shouldn't need to add routes by hand - are you on ubuntu desktop or server
2012-01-26T12:22:00.000Z	genewitch	BigTaxi	autonegotiation failing
2012-01-26T12:23:00.000Z	genewitch	BigTaxi	you can fix that with some commands i don't remember in a command line. but you can bridge (connection sharing) with the little network manager icon on the ubuntu desktop
2012-01-26T12:31:00.000Z	BigTaxi	genewitch	ethtool says there is autonegotiation, and it is supported, etc.
2012-01-26T12:32:00.000Z	genewitch	BigTaxi	right but it's failing, probably the xbox's fault. google turn off autonegotiation ubuntu eth
2012-01-26T12:37:00.000Z	BigTaxi	genewitch	well the autoneg is off
