2007-02-16T09:00:00.000Z	CapaH		Is there a way I can force my desktop to not have any icons on it -- like right now I have a usb drive plugged in and it put a 'usbdrive' icon on my desktop thus ruining my background image... how can I get around that?
2007-02-16T09:01:00.000Z	CapaH		but knowing how on a particular icon is great info as well
2007-02-16T09:03:00.000Z	CapaH		I have a laptop with wireless networking built in --- but it does not work for Ubuntu... what do I do? :)
2007-02-16T09:03:00.000Z	sebrock	CapaH	what does iwconfig give you?
2007-02-16T09:04:00.000Z	CapaH		shockingly it gives that I am connected to a wireless network :P lol
2007-02-16T09:05:00.000Z	CapaH		apparently I am fortunate and I dont have to worry about any drivers
2007-02-16T09:05:00.000Z	CapaH		... how can I see a list of all wireless networks and choose the one I wish to connect to?
2007-02-16T09:05:00.000Z	sebrock	CapaH	any ESSID?
2007-02-16T09:05:00.000Z	CapaH		yes sebrock
2007-02-16T09:05:00.000Z	sebrock		The right one I guess?
2007-02-16T09:06:00.000Z	sebrock	CapaH	so can you ping the routers IP?
2007-02-16T09:07:00.000Z	sebrock	CapaH	try ping 192.168.0.1 ,this is usually the IP of router
2007-02-16T09:07:00.000Z	CapaH	sebrock	I got replies
2007-02-16T09:08:00.000Z	sebrock		ok so thats a good sign
2007-02-16T09:08:00.000Z	sebrock		and ping www.google.com gives?
2007-02-16T09:08:00.000Z	CapaH		Well one question... how can I instruct my pings to use eth1 instead of eth0 ?
2007-02-16T09:09:00.000Z	sebrock	CapaH	hm... are you connected with the same computer on a wire now?
2007-02-16T09:09:00.000Z	CapaH		i.e. I have an ethernet cable plugged in in addition to wireless -- which is obviously how I am on IRC :)
2007-02-16T09:10:00.000Z	sebrock	CapaH	try ping -I <interface> <adress>
