2006-12-29T14:42:00.000Z	dwhsix		anyone here familiar with midi (hardware, not software)?
2006-12-29T14:42:00.000Z	alex-weej	dwhsix	hello
2006-12-29T14:44:00.000Z	alex-weej	dwhsix	does the keyboard have a USB interface or just MIDI outputs?
2006-12-29T14:44:00.000Z	dwhsix	alex-weej	I believe only MIDI... hang on I'll go check :-)
2006-12-29T14:45:00.000Z	alex-weej	dwhsix	if it has a USB interface, then it has a class-compliant MIDI interface built into it and it's very easy - you just plug and play
2006-12-29T14:45:00.000Z	alex-weej	dwhsix	otherwise, you need some MIDI hardware. most sound cards come with a MIDI port
2006-12-29T14:45:00.000Z	alex-weej	dwhsix	it either looks like a d-sub or a DIN
2006-12-29T14:46:00.000Z	dwhsix	alex-weej	yeah, it's only MIDI... it's a Yamaha PSR-290
2006-12-29T14:46:00.000Z	alex-weej	dwhsix	ok, read up :P
2006-12-29T14:46:00.000Z	dwhsix	alex-weej	am I better off just buying a piano kbd w/ usb
2006-12-29T14:46:00.000Z	alex-weej	dwhsix	er
2006-12-29T14:47:00.000Z	alex-weej	dwhsix	if you want to do decent music production, you'll need a good sound card which will have a MIDI interface anyway
2006-12-29T14:47:00.000Z	alex-weej	dwhsix	it's up to you
2006-12-29T14:47:00.000Z	dwhsix	alex-weej	recommendations?
2006-12-29T14:47:00.000Z	dwhsix	alex-weej	where can I read up?
2006-12-29T14:47:00.000Z	alex-weej	dwhsix	in the channel lol, i meant ^^
2006-12-29T14:48:00.000Z	alex-weej	dwhsix	"otherwise, you need some MIDI hardware. most sound cards come with a MIDI port"
2006-12-29T14:49:00.000Z	dwhsix	alex-weej	aha.  I wasn't keeping up (which can be a problem w/ 930+ people in the room)
2006-12-29T14:49:00.000Z	alex-weej	dwhsix	indeed :)
