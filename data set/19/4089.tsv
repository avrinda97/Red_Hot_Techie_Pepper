2009-07-10T12:56:00.000Z	rjmoore		does anyone know how to add a pgp key???
2009-07-10T12:57:00.000Z	rjmoore		i d-loaded the key to my desktop and it looks like this..............."xxxxxxxx.tar.gz.sig"
2009-07-10T12:58:00.000Z	rjmoore		thats what i thought but i dont know how to use that file type
2009-07-10T13:00:00.000Z	rjmoore		well file roller doesnt know what it is
2009-07-10T13:00:00.000Z	grawity	rjmoore	.sig files are not keys, they're signatures, and you need to use gpg --verify on them.
2009-07-10T13:05:00.000Z	grawity	rjmoore	yes
2009-07-10T13:05:00.000Z	grawity	rjmoore	you need two dashes before --verify
2009-07-10T13:06:00.000Z	grawity	rjmoore	well, it works - now go to TrueCrypt website and get their public key.
2009-07-10T13:07:00.000Z	grawity	rjmoore	the .sig file is a signature, not the key
2009-07-10T13:07:00.000Z	grawity	rjmoore	the actual key is at http://truecrypt.sourceforge.net/TrueCrypt-Foundation-Public-Key.asc
2009-07-10T13:08:00.000Z	grawity	rjmoore	no, wget
2009-07-10T13:10:00.000Z	grawity	rjmoore	wget -q -O- http://truecrypt.sourceforge.net/TrueCrypt-Foundation-Public-Key.asc | gpg --import; gpg --verify truecrypt-6.2a-ubuntu-x86.tar.gz.sig
2009-07-10T13:10:00.000Z	grawity	rjmoore	do you have an actual .tar.gz?
2009-07-10T13:11:00.000Z	grawity	rjmoore	ummm. you probably didn't download the actual program.
2009-07-10T13:11:00.000Z	grawity	rjmoore	.tar.gz?
2009-07-10T13:11:00.000Z	grawity	rjmoore	okay, tar xvf truecrypt-6.2a-ubuntu-x86.tar.gz
2009-07-10T13:17:00.000Z	grawity	rjmoore	well, it says "i686", so x86 should be right.
2009-07-10T13:18:00.000Z	grawity	rjmoore	i386 and i686 are mostly the same, and x86 means the same too.
2009-07-10T13:19:00.000Z	grawity	rjmoore	no, the .sig is not needed anymore
