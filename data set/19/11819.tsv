2006-01-24T07:11:00.000Z	bnD		can someone help me out pls? ive lost the ability to switch to terminals 1-6 when im in my display manager, which loads at boot.. so im unable to get to a console without display manager running :/
2006-01-24T07:12:00.000Z	Xenguy	bnD	Ctrl-Alt-BkSpc  ?
2006-01-24T07:12:00.000Z	bnD	Xenguy	takes me back to the login
2006-01-24T07:12:00.000Z	Xenguy	bnD	wow, and Ctrl-Alt-F2 won't work?
2006-01-24T07:13:00.000Z	bnD		if i press it three times it kills the DM, but then i just have a black screen, the only time i can get to console is when the system is shutting down.. THEN ctrl+alt+f1-6 work
2006-01-24T07:13:00.000Z	bnD	Xenguy	^
2006-01-24T07:13:00.000Z	bnD		for the 4 sec it takes to shutdown
2006-01-24T07:13:00.000Z	bnD		:/.
2006-01-24T07:13:00.000Z	bnD		and because i cant login to root
2006-01-24T07:13:00.000Z	bnD		i cant halt from the DM
2006-01-24T07:13:00.000Z	bnD		:l
2006-01-24T07:14:00.000Z	bnD	Xenguy	any thoughts?
2006-01-24T07:14:00.000Z	Xenguy	bnD	maybe you can logon with 'linux single', then disable gdm with 'apt-get remove gdm'  ?
2006-01-24T07:14:00.000Z	bnD	Xenguy	linux single?
2006-01-24T07:15:00.000Z	Xenguy	bnD	I haven't actually tried 'linux single' with Ubu, but it might work; otherwise perhaps a bootdisk could be made to work
2006-01-24T07:15:00.000Z	bnD	Xenguy	i think ill try remove WDM complete removal from synaptic, which will then force me to shutdown using the power button >_< then hopefully ill dump into a terminal upon boot, whereas i can reinstall wdm and hopefully this retardness wont re-occur :/
2006-01-24T07:15:00.000Z	bnD		ill try that
2006-01-24T07:15:00.000Z	bnD		brb
2006-01-24T07:16:00.000Z	Xenguy	bnD	yeah, that makes sense, if you can just remove *dm, then do that (you can re-install later)
