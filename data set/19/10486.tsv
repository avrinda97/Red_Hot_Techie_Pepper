2006-06-09T14:02:00.000Z	Flannel	Killuminati	there's a "system monitor" in the menues
2006-06-09T14:09:00.000Z	Flannel	Killuminati	you just asked that.  Do you need xampp? will normal lamp not work for you?
2006-06-09T14:09:00.000Z	Killuminati	Flannel	I downloaded xampp but it's calling itself lamp
2006-06-09T14:10:00.000Z	Flannel	Killuminati	xampp is a pre-packaged lamp install, essentially.

2006-06-09T14:40:00.000Z	Flannel	Killuminati	did you do the mp3 stuff for kubuntu?
2006-06-09T14:40:00.000Z	Flannel	Killuminati	you might find that someone in #kubuntu can help you better
2006-06-09T14:40:00.000Z	Killuminati	Flannel	I'M ON GNOME
2006-06-09T14:41:00.000Z	Flannel	Killuminati	did you get the gnome codecs or the kde shortcuts?
2006-06-09T14:41:00.000Z	Killuminati	Flannel	gnome codecs
2006-06-09T14:42:00.000Z	Flannel	Killuminati	that's your problem. amaroK is a KDE based program.
2006-06-09T14:42:00.000Z	Flannel	Killuminati	go install the KDE codecs, see if it works.
2006-06-09T15:04:00.000Z	Flannel	Killuminati	did you install the KDE mp3 codec?
