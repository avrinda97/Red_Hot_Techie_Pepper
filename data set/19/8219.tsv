2007-04-22T12:30:00.000Z	liquiddoom	moosejaw	If it's really shot, try editing fstab from a liveCD
2007-04-22T12:50:00.000Z	liquiddoom	moosejaw	Mount your root dir first
2007-04-22T12:50:00.000Z	liquiddoom	moosejaw	Try fdisk -l /dev/hda
2007-04-22T12:51:00.000Z	liquiddoom	moosejaw	You need to mount your hard drive to edit files on it.
2007-04-22T12:53:00.000Z	moosejaw	liquiddoom	so i want to mount sda1 what is that command?
2007-04-22T12:53:00.000Z	liquiddoom	moosejaw	sudo mount /dev/sda1 (mount point)
2007-04-22T12:54:00.000Z	moosejaw	liquiddoom	what should the mountpoint be?
2007-04-22T12:55:00.000Z	liquiddoom	moosejaw	Depends. Try sudo mkdir /media/hda1 and mount there?
2007-04-22T12:55:00.000Z	liquiddoom	moosejaw	Or sda1
2007-04-22T12:56:00.000Z	moosejaw	liquiddoom	i cant get it to mount
2007-04-22T12:56:00.000Z	liquiddoom	moosejaw	Any errors?
2007-04-22T12:57:00.000Z	liquiddoom	moosejaw	Oh... did I give you the mount command backwards?
2007-04-22T13:00:00.000Z	moosejaw	liquiddoom	thank you
2007-04-22T13:00:00.000Z	liquiddoom	moosejaw	Awesome.
