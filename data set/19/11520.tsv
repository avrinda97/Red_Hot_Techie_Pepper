2006-01-12T16:32:00.000Z	TengkSA		is it possible, through linux, to edit files on your windows mounted drives
2006-01-12T16:33:00.000Z	cyphase	TengkSA	yes, unless it's using NTFS
2006-01-12T16:33:00.000Z	cyphase	TengkSA	Qzxc means dangerous on NTFS
2006-01-12T16:34:00.000Z	cyphase	TengkSA	because linux doesn't have good support for writing to NTFS
2006-01-12T16:36:00.000Z	cyphase	TengkSA	no
2006-01-12T16:36:00.000Z	cyphase	TengkSA	what's your setup?
2006-01-12T16:36:00.000Z	TengkSA	cyphase	windows on one partition and linux on another
2006-01-12T16:37:00.000Z	cyphase	TengkSA	what are the filesystems?
2006-01-12T16:37:00.000Z	TengkSA	cyphase	ntfs
2006-01-12T16:38:00.000Z	cyphase	TengkSA	linux can read ntfs fine, but not write, whereas windows can't do anything with linux formats
2006-01-12T16:38:00.000Z	cyphase	TengkSA	consider making a third partition formatted as FAT32..
2006-01-12T16:39:00.000Z	cyphase	TengkSA	and use it for things you need to have on both
2006-01-12T16:39:00.000Z	TengkSA	cyphase	or format my 2nd hard drive .. my multimedia hard drive to be fat32
2006-01-12T16:39:00.000Z	cyphase	TengkSA	that too
2006-01-12T16:39:00.000Z	cyphase	TengkSA	yes
2006-01-12T16:39:00.000Z	cyphase	TengkSA	and either way, you can read the windows stuff with linux
2006-01-12T16:40:00.000Z	cyphase	TengkSA	so if you need to just move stuff from windows to linux, it'd be fine
2006-01-12T16:41:00.000Z	TengkSA	cyphase	no i wanna download stuff using linux too like music/movies but it obv cant save so that i can access it thru win
2006-01-12T16:41:00.000Z	cyphase	TengkSA	not in ntfs anyway
