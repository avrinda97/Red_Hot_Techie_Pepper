2012-11-13T17:30:00.000Z	PoolShark_		do you have security = user or securtiy = share in smb.conf?
2012-11-13T17:32:00.000Z	Laurenceb	PoolShark_	me?
2012-11-13T17:32:00.000Z	PoolShark_	Laurenceb	yes
2012-11-13T17:32:00.000Z	Laurenceb		ok
2012-11-13T17:32:00.000Z	Laurenceb	PoolShark_	where is smb.conf?
2012-11-13T17:32:00.000Z	PoolShark_	Laurenceb	/etc/samba
2012-11-13T17:33:00.000Z	Laurenceb		#   security = user
2012-11-13T17:33:00.000Z	Laurenceb	PoolShark_	^
2012-11-13T17:34:00.000Z	PoolShark_	Laurenceb	hrm... what GUI is it?
2012-11-13T17:34:00.000Z	Laurenceb	PoolShark_	Samba Server Configuration
2012-11-13T17:34:00.000Z	Laurenceb	PoolShark_	http://www.unixmen.com/how-to-configure-samba-using-a-graphical-interface-in-ubuntu/
2012-11-13T17:34:00.000Z	Laurenceb		im followiung that
2012-11-13T17:35:00.000Z	PoolShark_	Laurenceb	I've only ever configured samba by editing smb.conf... not sure why the GUI is being stupid
2012-11-13T17:35:00.000Z	PoolShark_		if you can create a share with the GUI, and then go in and add the "valid users = @user" to the share section in smb.conf, that will probably do what I think you are trying to do
2012-11-13T17:36:00.000Z	PoolShark_		(replace "@user" with the name of the user you want to have access to that share)
2012-11-13T17:36:00.000Z	Laurenceb	PoolShark_	the gui wont let me finish without users
2012-11-13T17:36:00.000Z	Laurenceb		ill speak to out network guys
2012-11-13T17:37:00.000Z	Laurenceb		it may be i cant see everything properly from here
2012-11-13T17:37:00.000Z	PoolShark_	Laurenceb	don't know what to tell you then... other than maybe try using swat or just do it in smb.conf yourself
