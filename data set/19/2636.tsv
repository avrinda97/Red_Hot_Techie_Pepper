2010-02-11T22:32:00.000Z	SirLoseALot		Hey everyone. I'm going to install Ubuntu on a 100 gig partition. I'll do a separate  /home. So, out of those 100 gigs, with 200MB going to /boot and 2 gigs going to swap, how big can /home be so everything else still has enough space without feeling crammed in?
2010-02-11T22:33:00.000Z	onaogh	SirLoseALot	home dir where all your files stored, in mycase, i filled up 78 gb of my home partition
2010-02-11T22:34:00.000Z	onaogh		if u want do it manually, SirLoseALot, just make partitions for /, /home/ and swap
2010-02-11T22:34:00.000Z	SirLoseALot	onaogh	Yeah, basically I was asking how much space everything *but* home needs. The size of home obviously depends on what I put there.
2010-02-11T22:35:00.000Z	SirLoseALot		I'm going to have /boot, /home and swap as seperate partitions, everything else goes to /
2010-02-11T22:35:00.000Z	onaogh	SirLoseALot	as you said, the size of Home depends on what you put there
2010-02-11T22:35:00.000Z	SirLoseALot	onaogh	Yep, that's why I was asking how much space everything else needs. You know, /dev, /media, /etc.... everything else :)
2010-02-11T22:35:00.000Z	onaogh	SirLoseALot	why a separate paritition for /boot ?
2010-02-11T22:36:00.000Z	SirLoseALot		because I will have / as ext4 but want to use grub (instead of grub2), so /boot can't be ext4
2010-02-11T22:36:00.000Z	onaogh		i use ext4, and i didnt set a separate partition for /boot, SirLoseALot
2010-02-11T22:37:00.000Z	SirLoseALot		using grub legacy??
2010-02-11T22:37:00.000Z	onaogh	SirLoseALot	the default grub that comes with 9.10
2010-02-11T22:37:00.000Z	SirLoseALot	onaogh	That's grub2, which can handle ext4
2010-02-11T22:37:00.000Z	onaogh	SirLoseALot	ok
2010-02-11T22:38:00.000Z	onaogh	SirLoseALot	my / partition uses around 8 GB, the / includes all the dirs except /home which is a separate partition
2010-02-11T22:39:00.000Z	onaogh	SirLoseALot	i am using KVM and setup a virtual machine for winXP, i have another encrypted file i mount with truecrypt of 4 GB, so if you dont use all that, yours will be less
2010-02-11T22:39:00.000Z	SirLoseALot	onaogh	I was thinking around 15gig for / and ~80gigs for /home - sounds like that should work comfortably
2010-02-11T22:39:00.000Z	onaogh		yep, 15 Gigs for / is fine, SirLoseALot
2010-02-11T22:40:00.000Z	onaogh	SirLoseALot	my root partition is 16 GB
