2012-05-01T02:27:00.000Z	nafta		hello, anyone know how could I run all php files in a directory with run-parts? I'm trying to do... run-parts /usr/bin/php /var/www/cron but it says run-parts: missing operand
2012-05-01T02:28:00.000Z	wassy121	nafta	run-parts isn't meant for that use.  What are you trying to do?
2012-05-01T02:28:00.000Z	wassy121	nafta	I think run-parts is part of the cron package itself.  I would try writing a small script, and put that in /etc/cron.d/
2012-05-01T02:29:00.000Z	nafta	wassy121	I'm trying to create a cronjob to run all the files in a directory...so in my crontab I have something like * * * * * run-parts /usr/bin/php /var/www/tweet_tnc/cron/
2012-05-01T02:29:00.000Z	wassy121	nafta	a script that does something like "for file in `ls /var/www/cron/`; do php $file; done"
2012-05-01T02:30:00.000Z	nafta	wassy121	can I actually use that exact piece of code you wrote bro?
2012-05-01T02:30:00.000Z	wassy121	nafta	pretty close, yes.  Directory needs to be changed, but that is the right syntax
2012-05-01T02:30:00.000Z	wassy121	nafta	I would put it in a shell script in like /home/blah/scripts/run-crons.sh .
2012-05-01T02:31:00.000Z	wassy121	nafta	and have run-crons.sh be an executable file that just says what I wrote above
2012-05-01T02:33:00.000Z	wassy121	nafta	l3top is right.  Specifically because ls doesn't translate spaces and special characters right
2012-05-01T02:35:00.000Z	nafta	wassy121	Could not open input file: feed_0.php
2012-05-01T02:36:00.000Z	wassy121	nafta	never 777 :(  755 at most please
2012-05-01T02:36:00.000Z	wassy121	nafta	I think my find command I gave above is a bit better.  Takes "for" and "ls" out of the picture
2012-05-01T02:41:00.000Z	nafta	wassy121	that last script runs fantastic
2012-05-01T02:42:00.000Z	nafta	wassy121	so basically...in my crontab -e I can add * * * * * * /home/myscript
2012-05-01T02:42:00.000Z	wassy121	nafta	that's right.
2012-05-01T02:43:00.000Z	nafta	wassy121	mind my asking...that crontab thing is always running by default? or do i have to activate it? in case I restart the server etc?
2012-05-01T02:44:00.000Z	wassy121	nafta	it should always be running.  It's a system service that you probably wouldn't ever turn off.
2012-05-01T03:19:00.000Z	nafta	wassy121	thanks for all your help, everything is working perfectly.
