2005-11-18T17:52:00.000Z	MrFarts		hey
2005-11-18T17:52:00.000Z	MrFarts		is there anything like yum for ubuntu ?
2005-11-18T17:54:00.000Z	MrFarts		would you guys say that running ubuntu on a server is a reasonable idea ?
2005-11-18T17:55:00.000Z	MrFarts		or is it a bit too bleeding edge ?
2005-11-18T17:55:00.000Z	MrFarts		thanks
2005-11-18T17:55:00.000Z	MrFarts		i quite liked it, but they are way too slow to update
2005-11-18T17:56:00.000Z	MrFarts		i was intrigued by the fact that ubuntu appears to to debian-based
2005-11-18T17:56:00.000Z	Stormx2	MrFarts	Well it is =)
2005-11-18T17:59:00.000Z	Stormx2	MrFarts	One.
2005-11-18T17:59:00.000Z	Stormx2	MrFarts	No.
2005-11-18T17:59:00.000Z	Stormx2	MrFarts	It works fine without downloading anything else
2005-11-18T06:00:00.000Z	Stormx2	MrFarts	But of course, you'll want to put more stuff on eventually ;-) Thats where apt-get or synaptic come in
2005-11-18T06:00:00.000Z	Stormx2	MrFarts	if you enter the server option on the install cd, you get what you need, methinks
2005-11-18T06:01:00.000Z	Stormx2	MrFarts	gcc is available in the repos, yeah
2005-11-18T06:01:00.000Z	MrFarts	Stormx2	it's not installed by default ?!
2005-11-18T06:01:00.000Z	Stormx2	MrFarts	I... don't think so. Not sure, mind.
2005-11-18T06:02:00.000Z	Stormx2	MrFarts	But if you are running a server you'll have internet and hence access to download it ;-)
2005-11-18T06:03:00.000Z	Stormx2	MrFarts	Or simply "sudo apt-get install <packagename>" both work, you're more likely to see instructions with apt-get
2005-11-18T06:04:00.000Z	Stormx2	MrFarts	Good luck =)
