2005-11-15T16:43:00.000Z	bob2	ancient	then you need to be a lot more specific about what you want to do

2005-11-15T16:50:00.000Z	bob2	ancient	I would have thought I'd made it clear over the past couple of months that you need to show things like your sources.list and the error from apt?
2005-11-15T16:50:00.000Z	bob2	ancient	uh, get rid of that line from your sources.list then
2005-11-15T16:50:00.000Z	ancient	bob2	can walk 3 blocks home, and send myself a good sources.list, or ask for one and save the walk
2005-11-15T16:50:00.000Z	bob2	ancient	um
2005-11-15T16:51:00.000Z	bob2	ancient	apt-setup did not put a backports line in your sources.list
2005-11-15T16:52:00.000Z	bob2	ancient	so why is it in there?
