2007-05-13T14:16:00.000Z	ziroday	nathan	bad config
2007-05-13T14:19:00.000Z	ziroday	nathan	did you put the resolutions you wanted in your xorg?
2007-05-13T14:21:00.000Z	ziroday	nathan	what card and how did you install the drivers?
2007-05-13T14:22:00.000Z	nathan	ziroday	MSI 7600GS.  I tried three different drivers configuring different wayts to sunday..  I do know the nVidia driver I'm using now I let automatix install for me.
2007-05-13T14:23:00.000Z	ziroday	nathan	ever try envy?
2007-08-25T14:34:00.000Z	ziroday	nathan	complaining isnt going to solve your porblem
2007-08-25T14:35:00.000Z	ziroday	nathan	yes there is
2007-08-25T14:35:00.000Z	ziroday	nathan	give me a min
2007-08-25T14:36:00.000Z	ziroday	nathan	in a terminal - lspci | grep VGA
2007-08-25T14:36:00.000Z	ziroday	nathan	see what it returns
2007-08-25T14:42:00.000Z	ziroday	nathan	when you ran the command lspci | grep VGA did it return anything
2007-08-25T14:42:00.000Z	ziroday	nathan	that means you have a intergrated intel card
2007-08-25T14:43:00.000Z	ziroday	nathan	which is very unlikely to be able to run compiz fusion
2007-09-01T10:58:00.000Z	ziroday	nathan	wine is better vmware cant take heavy 3d yet
2007-09-01T10:58:00.000Z	nathan	ziroday	I tried wine but it's unplayable since it doesn't hook the mouse
2007-09-01T10:59:00.000Z	ziroday	nathan	theres also crossover offfice and cedega. Plus i reccomend you look at appdb in wine to find out how to play it. VMware is not able to process heavy 3d yet
2007-09-01T11:02:00.000Z	nathan	ziroday	which of those are free and what do you mean about finding out how it is played?
