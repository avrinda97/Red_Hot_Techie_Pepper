2008-05-28T02:32:00.000Z	caleb		It seems that the ati driver 8.5 makes my screen go white when I log in. I upgraded gusty to hardy, but then installed from a live cd to get a clean slate, it didn't do this when I just upgraded. Also, the driver worked for a little while after I installed from a live cd, but now it doesn't.
2008-05-28T02:32:00.000Z	chev_chelios	caleb	check if the system is using restricted drivers.
2008-05-28T02:33:00.000Z	caleb	chev_chelios	I followed the guide here: http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu_Hardy_Installation_Guide
2008-05-28T02:34:00.000Z	chev_chelios	caleb	wait, I'll see that now...
2008-05-28T02:35:00.000Z	caleb	chev_chelios	I did the manual way on that page

2008-05-28T02:35:00.000Z	chev_chelios	caleb	what was wrong with "ubuntu way"?
2008-05-28T02:35:00.000Z	chev_chelios	caleb	i see
2008-05-28T02:36:00.000Z	caleb	chev_chelios	I like to get the latest drivers and being able to somewhat control a problem if something goes wrong during installation
2008-05-28T02:36:00.000Z	chev_chelios	caleb	i think you messed up the default ubuntu packages, and that the system is not using the drivers you installed.
2008-05-28T02:37:00.000Z	chev_chelios	caleb	did the install went good? no problems?
2008-05-28T02:37:00.000Z	caleb	chev_chelios	no problems
2008-05-28T02:38:00.000Z	chev_chelios	caleb	and the driver, does it load? check if the system is using restricted drivers.
2008-05-28T02:38:00.000Z	caleb	chev_chelios	it seems that the bug was reported: http://ati.cchtml.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1107 but that is for 8.4
2008-05-28T02:38:00.000Z	caleb	chev_chelios	I know it loads
2008-05-28T02:38:00.000Z	chev_chelios	caleb	what are you using? not hardy? are you on 7.10?
2008-05-28T02:39:00.000Z	caleb	chev_chelios	I am using hardy
2008-05-28T02:40:00.000Z	chev_chelios	caleb	you installed 8.5 drivers, right? and you got the same problem? perhaps, they are buggy...
2008-05-28T02:41:00.000Z	chev_chelios	caleb	sorry, i cannot help, maybe someone could direct you on changing some config file...
