2007-01-28T15:15:00.000Z	juano	sto_	yes i have vmware
2007-01-28T15:15:00.000Z	juano	sto_	did you run the uninstaller? vmware workstation right?
2007-01-28T15:16:00.000Z	juano	sto_	and when you run the installer? what happens?
2007-01-28T15:17:00.000Z	sto_	juano	it tells me vmware server is already installed
2007-01-28T15:17:00.000Z	juano	sto_	check you /etc and check to see if you have vmware stuff in there
2007-01-28T15:17:00.000Z	juano	sto_	same happened to me, i deleted the vmware folder in there and then ran the installer again fine
2007-01-28T15:17:00.000Z	sto_	juano	i do have a /etc/vmware dir
2007-01-28T15:18:00.000Z	juano	sto_	delete it, rm -r vmwaredir
2007-01-28T15:18:00.000Z	juano	sto_	try running the installer now

2007-01-28T15:19:00.000Z	juano	sto_	i recommend giving the ENTER options at prompts, default options
