2006-05-27T16:51:00.000Z	scottt106		is there something i need to install to use the "make" command?
2006-05-27T16:52:00.000Z	scottt106		oh, wonderful, guess I came at the right time
2006-05-27T16:52:00.000Z	scottt106		thanks  :)
2006-05-27T12:30:00.000Z	scottt106		Hi, I'm trying to compile a library (libid3tag) because I couldn't find it in the repository.  To "make" it, it required another library, zlib, which isn't in the repository.  After downloading them both and compiling zlib, libid3tag still doesn't find zlib installed.  Am I doing something wrong, or is there an easier way?
2006-05-27T12:32:00.000Z	bimberi	scottt106	install libid3tag0
2006-05-27T12:32:00.000Z	scottt106	bimberi	i have lib3tag0 installed, but another library I'm trying to compile is calling for lib3tag... is there some way to tell it to use libid3tag0 ?
2006-05-27T12:34:00.000Z	bimberi	scottt106	you could try a symlink
2006-05-27T12:34:00.000Z	scottt106	bimberi	i'm a little new to linux, is there somewhere i can learn about a symlink?
2006-05-27T12:35:00.000Z	bimberi	scottt106	kk, sec...
2006-05-27T12:36:00.000Z	bimberi	scottt106	what's the actual error you're getting (use the pastebin if it's more than 1 line)
2006-05-27T12:37:00.000Z	bimberi	scottt106	i'm not sure that a symlink is the right solution (not avoiding answering) :)

2006-05-27T12:42:00.000Z	bimberi	scottt106	try installing libid3tag0-dev
2006-05-27T12:42:00.000Z	scottt106	bimberi	ok, i'll tell you if that works
2006-05-27T12:43:00.000Z	bimberi	scottt106	i found that out by doing '/msg ubotu find id3tag.h' and that file is in the libid3tag0-dev package
2006-05-27T12:44:00.000Z	bimberi	scottt106	you can also do package contents searches via http://packages.ubuntu.com
2006-05-27T12:44:00.000Z	scottt106	bimberi	ok cool, thanks
2006-05-27T12:47:00.000Z	scottt106	bimberi	looks like it worked.  thanks for your help
2006-05-27T12:47:00.000Z	bimberi	scottt106	yay, np :)
