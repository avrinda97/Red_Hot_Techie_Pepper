2011-05-29T20:13:00.000Z	johnnee		i have live cd, and using it now ejv.. can you tell me what the next step should be... im real new to ubuntu and don't have a clue
2011-05-29T20:13:00.000Z	edbian	johnnee	Is this Ubuntu 11.04 ?
2011-05-29T20:18:00.000Z	edbian	johnnee	So the live CD is 11.04 and the installed system is 10.10 in between upgrades?
2011-05-29T20:20:00.000Z	edbian	johnnee	I won't teamview in but I will teach you how to fix it.  It's only one command.  How's that sound??
2011-05-29T20:20:00.000Z	johnnee	edbian	yes is the answer to your question, but ialso have a 10.10 live cd also
2011-05-29T20:20:00.000Z	edbian	johnnee	Grab and boot the 10.10 live CD.  I am more confident about the grub-install command that is on that live CD.
2011-05-29T20:22:00.000Z	johnnee	edbian	oh man it took me long enough to get to this point where i can join this chat channel, not sure if i can get back on so you can continue helping me..
2011-05-29T20:23:00.000Z	edbian	johnnee	Sure, no big deal.  You're on a 11.04 live CD then right now?
2011-05-29T20:23:00.000Z	edbian	johnnee	Do you have more than one harddrive?
2011-05-29T20:24:00.000Z	johnnee	edbian	YES, im on live cd 11.04... if i could just get my windows back, im open to back up some important files and reinstall both... i have an external drive i can connect via usb also.
2011-05-29T20:25:00.000Z	edbian	johnnee	first you need to mount the ubuntu partition.  sudo mount /dev/sdaX /mnt   You can figure out what number X should be by looking at the output of sudo fdisk -l
2011-05-29T20:26:00.000Z	edbian	johnnee	awesome.  So if you go into /mnt you see the files for your Ubuntu system right?  It should NOT be an empty folder
2011-05-29T20:29:00.000Z	johnnee	edbian	i can see the contents both in terminal and in the explorer like GUI
2011-05-29T20:29:00.000Z	edbian	johnnee	Excellent.  sudo grub-install --boot-directory=/mnt/boot/ /dev/sda
2011-05-29T20:31:00.000Z	edbian	johnnee	What's it saying?
2011-05-29T20:34:00.000Z	johnnee	edbian	can you teamviewer in my laptop?
2011-05-29T20:35:00.000Z	edbian	johnnee	Nope.
2011-05-29T20:35:00.000Z	edbian	johnnee	Did the command produce errors?
2011-05-29T20:36:00.000Z	edbian	johnnee	I just did.
