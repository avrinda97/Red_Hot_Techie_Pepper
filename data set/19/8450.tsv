2007-04-09T16:06:00.000Z	Zues_62		hey how do i give permisions to a drive
2007-04-09T16:07:00.000Z	Zues_62		does anyone know how to set the permisions
2007-04-09T16:07:00.000Z	Zues_62		so all groups can access them
2007-04-09T16:07:00.000Z	Zues_62		aye
2007-04-09T16:08:00.000Z	Zues_62		what is the comand for setting permisions so all groups can access a drive
2007-04-09T16:09:00.000Z	Zues_62		what is the comand guys
2007-04-09T16:09:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	Zues_62	chmod a+r <folder> will give everyone access to that folder
2007-04-09T16:09:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	Zues_62	a+rwx will give full access
2007-04-09T16:10:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	Zues_62	in a terminal. Do a chmod -R a+r on the mount point of the drive (usually it'll be mounted in /media if it's a secondary drive/partition)
2007-04-09T16:11:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	Zues_62	you can probably use the gnome file manager to do it too but I have old habits ;)
2007-04-09T16:11:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	Zues_62	how do you mean? Are you getting an error?
2007-04-09T16:12:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	Zues_62	well... then you're choosing the wrong directory... or else your filesystem is screwed
2007-04-09T16:13:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	Zues_62	what's the exact command you are running?
2007-04-09T16:13:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	Zues_62	could you paste it here please?
2007-04-09T16:14:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	Zues_62	don't mean to patronise but are you sure you have a directory called media/UsbDisk?
2007-04-09T16:17:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	Zues_62	yup. As I say, for full access use a+rwx instead.
2007-04-09T16:17:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	Zues_62	I told you a+r first because I didn't want to trick you into accidentally giving write access, incase you didn't want that to happen, sorry
2007-04-09T16:19:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	Zues_62	hmm, that's odd. "chmod -R a+rwx /media/UsbDisk" should give everyone full access.
2007-04-09T16:21:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	Zues_62	this may be a mounting issue rather than a permissions one. Type "mount" and check that it's been mounted rw.
