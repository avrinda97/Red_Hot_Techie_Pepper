2009-02-25T02:36:00.000Z	duelboot	shadeslayer	wish I knew...happened to me once...didn't spend enough time to figure it out...it went away next time I did a fresh install though :)
2009-02-25T02:49:00.000Z	duelboot	shadeslayer	.so is a softlink or symbolic link...depending on who you ask...you don't install it
2009-02-25T02:49:00.000Z	shadeslayer	duelboot	its a splash image,like ubuntu loading bar
2009-02-25T02:50:00.000Z	duelboot	shadeslayer	haven't messed with that, but presume you need to put the .so in a specific location that it's looking for the file (the .so will reference the "real"/hard file used)
2009-02-25T02:51:00.000Z	shadeslayer	duelboot	actually i have put it in a specific place

2009-02-25T02:52:00.000Z	duelboot	shadeslayer	give me time to read it...hold one
2009-02-25T02:52:00.000Z	shadeslayer	duelboot	sure np
2009-02-25T02:53:00.000Z	duelboot	shadeslayer	did you copy the command in total?  It should have prompted a question...if you did, then I'm out of suggestions
2009-02-25T02:53:00.000Z	shadeslayer	duelboot	yes
2009-02-25T02:54:00.000Z	shadeslayer	duelboot	but the specific so im trying to install was not shown
2009-02-25T02:54:00.000Z	duelboot	shadeslayer	type "sudo update-alternatives â€“config usplash-artwork" and see what happens
2009-02-25T02:55:00.000Z	duelboot	shadeslayer	actually do this:   apt-get install - -reinstall usplash
2009-02-25T02:58:00.000Z	shadeslayer	duelboot	done,found this too http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=574314
2009-02-25T02:58:00.000Z	shadeslayer	duelboot	what next XD
2009-02-25T02:58:00.000Z	duelboot	shadeslayer	I give up :(
