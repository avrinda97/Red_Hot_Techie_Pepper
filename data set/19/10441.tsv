2006-12-14T06:18:00.000Z	patbam		hi, does anyone happen to know where python2.5 's libs are supposed to live in dapper? they seem to be in /usr/local/lib/python.2.5 but 2.4 was in /usr/lib/python2.4 (no /local/ )
2006-12-14T06:19:00.000Z	jrib	patbam	/usr/local is stuff you installed without using the package manager
2006-12-14T06:20:00.000Z	patbam	jrib	ah, oh yeah. i guess i installed 2.5 from a tarball, forgot. if 2.5 is in the repos now, would installing it from synaptic be extraordinarily bad, ray?
2006-12-14T06:20:00.000Z	jrib	patbam	no, but your system will still prefer the one in /usr/local since /usr/local comes first in your PATH
2006-12-14T06:21:00.000Z	patbam	jrib	that makes sense. thanks for your help
2006-12-14T06:22:00.000Z	jrib	patbam	I would remove the /usr/local installation and use the repositories myself.  np
2006-12-14T06:22:00.000Z	patbam	jrib	i'm looking to see if 2.5 has made it into the repo yet
2006-12-14T06:22:00.000Z	jrib	patbam	I know it is in edgy, don't know about dapper
2006-12-14T06:22:00.000Z	patbam	jrib	doesn't seem to be there, guess not yet.
2006-12-14T06:22:00.000Z	patbam	jrib	the name "edgy" makes me nervous :D
2006-12-14T06:22:00.000Z	jrib	patbam	heh
2006-12-14T06:29:00.000Z	jrib	patbam	no, you can just use gksu, no sudo
2006-12-14T06:29:00.000Z	patbam	jrib	head a splodes somewhat.
2007-01-27T07:40:00.000Z	jrib	patbam	NO :)
2007-01-27T07:40:00.000Z	patbam	jrib	lol , ok
2007-02-22T11:03:00.000Z	jrib	patbam	/home/jrib/.gtk-bookmarks  maybe?
2007-02-22T11:04:00.000Z	patbam	jrib	thanks... hmm,  i don't seem to have a .gtk-boomarks
2007-02-22T11:04:00.000Z	patbam	jrib	nice, that's it. gracias
2007-02-22T11:04:00.000Z	jrib	patbam	for the record, I just crated a bookmark with a name like oiusdfaoiuds and grepped for it :)
