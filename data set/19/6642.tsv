2008-01-06T22:26:00.000Z	MisterChief		Lowest VESA?
2008-01-06T22:26:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	MisterChief	1024x768
2008-01-06T22:29:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	MisterChief	Yes accept the default for the rest of the options after you select vesa mode/driver and 1024 for the max res
2008-01-06T22:29:00.000Z	MisterChief	Jack_Sparrow	COuld I have possibly going wrong when I choose 1440x900 if I have a widescreen monitor?
2008-01-06T22:30:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	MisterChief	If you chose vesa .. yes
2008-01-06T22:30:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	MisterChief	1024 is the max that the all purpose driver veda supports.
2008-01-07T00:03:00.000Z	MisterChief	Jack_Sparrow	I only realised that after I tried installing it, so I'm just trying to get my computer working now
2008-01-07T00:05:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	MisterChief	What are you trying to transfer.. and to where.. a different partition?
2008-01-07T00:07:00.000Z	MisterChief	Jack_Sparrow	I'm transferring to a different computer on the network
2008-01-07T00:08:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	MisterChief	Are you trying to copy /home to a different computer?
2008-01-07T00:08:00.000Z	MisterChief	Jack_Sparrow	Yes, I'm going to try resetting everything on the linux computer
2008-01-07T00:09:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	MisterChief	It is easier to reinstall...  rolling it back is a lot of trouble..  also having a sep /home will help youin the future
2008-01-07T00:10:00.000Z	MisterChief	Jack_Sparrow	the only trouble is that if I want to reinstall, I have to grab a CD drive from another computer and put it on, then run the disk
2008-01-07T00:10:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	MisterChief	If you want to clone your existing install we have a help page for that
2008-01-07T00:11:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	MisterChief	For what it is worth.. we know doing that will work... trying to undo everything you did.. is a lot more work
2008-01-07T00:12:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	MisterChief	During the install.. select manual partitioning and create a sep home and set it's mount point as /home
2008-01-07T00:15:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	MisterChief	Depends on what all you installed and HOW you installed it..  We have told you repeatedly, rolling back your install is a long hard problem.
2008-01-07T00:46:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	MisterChief	I linked.. ages ago on how to clone your install or create a list of installed packages..
2008-01-07T00:47:00.000Z	MisterChief	Jack_Sparrow	Oh, sorry, thanks :D
