2012-01-18T19:17:00.000Z	elo_	bazhang	yeah well i was thinking on connecting an external wifi antenna and for that i need a usb wifi card. so i just asked myself. perhaps ubuntu wont recognize the usb wifi. i really have no idea :)
2012-01-18T19:18:00.000Z	bazhang	elo_	the eeepc has an internal wifi already
2012-01-18T19:20:00.000Z	bazhang	elo_	not really. it's quite good as is
2012-01-18T19:21:00.000Z	bazhang	elo_	do what you wish. won't make much of a difference though. and Ubuntu runs fine on those
