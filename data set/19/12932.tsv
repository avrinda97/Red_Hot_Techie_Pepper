2005-06-16T06:13:00.000Z	mjr	makoto	oh, hm, if you want to convert, that won't cut it, but it seemed that now you want to just format (or make a filesystem, rather)
2005-06-16T06:14:00.000Z	makoto	mjr	yeah i'd rather not have to but I think I have not choice but to format
2005-06-16T06:15:00.000Z	makoto	mjr	is there no part of the command that specifies fat32 and not fat16?
2005-06-16T06:15:00.000Z	mjr	makoto	it determines it automatically, though you can spesify it manually too; man mkfs.vfat
2005-06-16T06:15:00.000Z	mjr	makoto	-F 32 in this case
2005-06-16T06:16:00.000Z	mjr	makoto	hm, actually, it seems that it won't automatically make fat32, so you actually need the -F 32; my bad
2005-06-16T06:17:00.000Z	makoto	mjr	ok thanks last question.  Im new to terminal commads,.  I assume I will also have to specify which drive. Now Linux doesn't seem to use letter like windos does.  The drive used to be D:  what would be the complete command?
2005-06-16T06:19:00.000Z	mjr	makoto	there's no straightforward way to convert that; I would _guess_ it'd be mkfs.vfat -F 32 /dev/hda5, but don't do that until you're sure it actually is that
2005-06-16T06:21:00.000Z	mjr	makoto	(you need to do that with sudo)
2005-06-16T06:21:00.000Z	makoto	mjr	its called Hdb1...
2005-06-16T06:22:00.000Z	mjr	makoto	yep, should, if you're sure that's the one :)
2005-06-16T06:22:00.000Z	makoto	mjr	lets hope so
2005-06-16T06:22:00.000Z	makoto	mjr	: )
2005-06-16T06:22:00.000Z	mjr	makoto	(it's the first partition of your primary slave disk)
2005-06-16T06:23:00.000Z	makoto	mjr	thats right first and only
2005-06-16T06:23:00.000Z	mjr	makoto	good, go for it then
2005-06-16T06:24:00.000Z	makoto	mjr	sweet, But first i have to copy 60G of data.  The fun never ends
2005-06-16T06:33:00.000Z	makoto	mjr	  what would this commmand format my drive to? (Found googling) mke2fs -j /dev/hdb1
