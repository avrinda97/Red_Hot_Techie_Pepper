2012-03-27T11:16:00.000Z	robinsmidsrod		so nobody's got a preseed.cfg that skips everything but disk/mbr questions?
2012-03-27T11:17:00.000Z	sacarlson	robinsmidsrod	there is a gui tool to create preseed.cfg but I've never used it
2012-03-27T11:17:00.000Z	robinsmidsrod	sacarlson	do you have a name for that?
2012-03-27T11:18:00.000Z	sacarlson	robinsmidsrod	it's kickstart  but the verison in ubuntu 10.04 didn't work
2012-03-27T11:19:00.000Z	robinsmidsrod	sacarlson	kickstart and preseed are different things - same tool does both?
2012-03-27T11:19:00.000Z	sacarlson	robinsmidsrod	kickstart is the gui that creates the proseed.cfg file for you
2012-03-27T11:20:00.000Z	robinsmidsrod	sacarlson	well, from what I can see, it creates ks.cfg, not preseed.cfg, which are two vastly different config files
2012-03-27T11:21:00.000Z	sacarlson	robinsmidsrod	or maybe I'm confused it with something else,  oh ok but it creates a config to automate install, is that what preseed.cfg does
2012-03-27T11:21:00.000Z	robinsmidsrod	sacarlson	kickstart is the redhat-derived autoinstall configuration system, but preseed is the debian-installer specific one
2012-03-27T11:21:00.000Z	robinsmidsrod	sacarlson	afaik, ks.cfg is not very well supported on debian
2012-03-27T11:22:00.000Z	sacarlson	robinsmidsrod	well I pulled kickstart from ppa that supports ubuntu
2012-03-27T11:24:00.000Z	robinsmidsrod	sacarlson	do you have a URL to that ppa?
2012-03-27T11:26:00.000Z	sacarlson	robinsmidsrod	not off hand but this is the first I found http://serverfault.com/questions/295174/upgrade-the-ubuntu-puppet-package-within-kickstart-process
2012-03-27T11:27:00.000Z	sacarlson	robinsmidsrod	also note I've never used it just looked at it and was thinking of using it
2012-03-27T11:29:00.000Z	robinsmidsrod	sacarlson	well, the system-config-kickstart gui program works, and it does create a config file, but I need preseed, not kickstart, because kickstart is too coarse to handle the details I want to configure.....
2012-03-27T11:31:00.000Z	robinsmidsrod	sacarlson	I've been working actively on my pxe network booting setup for some time now (using the awesome ipxe) and now I'm trying to minimize the amount of typing I have to do on each ubuntu install
2012-03-27T11:32:00.000Z	sacarlson	robinsmidsrod	sounds cool,  I never seen ipxe before,  I have a standard pxe boot install setup for iso files
2012-03-27T11:32:00.000Z	robinsmidsrod	sacarlson	the main benefit is that it supports loading files via http, which is so much faster than tftp
2012-03-27T11:33:00.000Z	robinsmidsrod	sacarlson	if you're into it, please join us in #ipxe
