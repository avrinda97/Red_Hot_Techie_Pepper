2007-12-17T04:44:00.000Z	ipiz		Does anyone know why, whenever I ssh to my friend's debian box, it's really slow. Both of us have broadband. Is this a known issue or something? How do I speed it up
2007-12-17T04:44:00.000Z	sethk	ipiz	slow how?  command line not responsive?
2007-12-17T04:45:00.000Z	sethk	ipiz	throughput must exist end to end.  Broadband at both ends doesn't help if there's a bottleneck between.
2007-12-17T04:45:00.000Z	ipiz	sethk	It's like when I type "sethk" .. after 5 seconds, it starts with write word by word "sethk"
2007-12-17T04:45:00.000Z	sethk	ipiz	I assume you mean letter by letter
2007-12-17T04:50:00.000Z	ipiz	sethk	any help?
2007-12-17T04:46:00.000Z	sethk	ipiz	try running ping for a while, see what the round trips are.
2007-12-17T04:46:00.000Z	ipiz	sethk	sorry, your right. letter by letter.
2007-12-17T04:46:00.000Z	ipiz	sethk	We
2007-12-17T04:46:00.000Z	ipiz	sethk	We're in opposite of the earth.
2007-12-17T04:47:00.000Z	ipiz	sethk	latency would be high, cause he's in florida, and I'm currently in United Arab Emirates.
2007-12-17T04:48:00.000Z	sethk	ipiz	true, but it will still be useful, especially after the first few packets.
2007-12-17T04:51:00.000Z	sethk	ipiz	you can run some test programs, but all that will tell you is what you already know.
2007-12-17T04:52:00.000Z	sethk	ipiz	try a traceroute, see if that might give any clues.
2007-12-17T04:52:00.000Z	ipiz	sethk	isn't that replaced by tracepath? heh.
2007-12-17T04:53:00.000Z	sethk	ipiz	not for me, I'm a dinosaur  :)
2007-12-17T04:53:00.000Z	ipiz	sethk	Anywho, I can connect , no problem.. but it's just lagging ..
2007-12-17T04:53:00.000Z	ipiz	sethk	Anywho, I can connect , no problem.. but it's just lagging ..
2007-12-17T05:00:00.000Z	ipiz	sethk	sorry, wasn't paying any attention ..
