2012-03-13T08:23:00.000Z	schelry		ok opening up this question to the room: do you know if the full install live cd for 10.04.4 includes packages that were not installed during the normal process? E.g., without network access, is there a way to install ndiswrapper or wicd?
2012-03-13T08:24:00.000Z	dr_willis	schelry	i dont think so
2012-03-13T08:25:00.000Z	schelry	dr_willis	ok how about this. Since I have networking on my mac, how would I go about downloading the necessary packages so I can put them on a disk/usb and then go about installing them from the drive onto the linux box?
2012-03-13T08:25:00.000Z	dr_willis	schelry	 thats doable.
2012-03-13T08:29:00.000Z	schelry	dr_willis	forgive me if this is a stupid question… how?
2012-03-13T08:29:00.000Z	dr_willis	schelry	 no idea. id set um network shareing and run a cable. :)
2012-03-13T08:31:00.000Z	schelry	dr_willis	my network is already shared but unfortunately the cable modem I have has only the one input… can't run a cable to the other computer… (Wired would be awesome but… not willing to make the primary computer have no internet)
2012-03-13T08:32:00.000Z	dr_willis	schelry	 s2itch the cable for the 10 min it wi take to get the files..
2012-03-13T08:33:00.000Z	schelry	dr_willis	it never is only 10 min. every time there's a change to this home network I lose networking for a week_+. I am past the point where just switching cables is something I want to try….
2012-03-13T08:34:00.000Z	dr_willis	schelry	 a home router may be a good investment for you.
2012-03-13T08:38:00.000Z	schelry	dr_willis	I have a home router, belkin, wireless g, however the cable modem from comcast does NOT have enough ports for me to do anything other than link the one pc to the one cable modem (no router capabilities). I guess it assumes other computers would access the network wirelessly, which tehy should/would/could if i could get this linux box to use its wireless card.
2012-03-13T08:46:00.000Z	dr_willis	schelry	 i just go modem -- router -- rest of the lan.  some of my pcs are wired to the router. others are wireless. i do have to power off the modem if i switch routers,
2012-03-13T09:05:00.000Z	schelry	dr_willis	well, it seems that now my router is part of the setup, the mac still gets internet and the ubuntu box still doesn't… having a hard wire going from the router to the linuxbox didn't achieve diddly, even after restart
2012-03-13T09:06:00.000Z	dr_willis	schelry	 check ifconfig, and netwoek manager.  also check the cables perhaps
2012-03-13T09:10:00.000Z	schelry	dr_willis	it seems my problem is a missing power cord… i'm actually surprised that the router is working without it for the main mac connection.
2012-03-13T09:10:00.000Z	dr_willis	schelry	 need moar powar scotty!
2012-03-13T09:12:00.000Z	dr_willis	schelry	 evety time i get a new gizmo i mark the power supply with a marker
2012-03-13T09:26:00.000Z	schelry	dr_willis	i managed to track down a powercord that hadn't mad it into my bag o' wires, and it works. unfortunately, even after restart, the wired connection on the pc still isn't showing up. (there's a red exclamation point).
2012-03-13T09:27:00.000Z	dr_willis	schelry	 use the shell. see if you got an ip. see if you can ping the router
