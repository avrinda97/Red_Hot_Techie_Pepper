2011-08-02T23:17:00.000Z	appi_uppi		hi please help me in configuring dyndns on ubuntu
2011-08-02T23:17:00.000Z	dr_willis	appi_uppi	 many routers these days have built in dyndns servers.
2011-08-02T23:18:00.000Z	appi_uppi	dr_willis	i'm trying to follow the steps given here root@srinivasa-laptop:/home/srinivasa# sudo /etc/init.d/ddclient status
2011-08-02T23:19:00.000Z	appi_uppi	dr_willis	sorry for that paste, i have followed the steps given in https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DynamicDNS
2011-08-02T23:19:00.000Z	appi_uppi	dr_willis	looks like some problem with dyndns setup
2011-10-24T10:30:00.000Z	dr_willis	appi_uppi	 output redirection. using the angle brackets.
2011-11-15T11:50:00.000Z	dr_willis	appi_uppi	 that did not make a lot of sence.
2011-11-15T11:51:00.000Z	appi_uppi	dr_willis	we are using wan accelerator to encrypt/compress the data while transfering, we are internalling using scp to transfer the files across sites
2011-11-15T11:51:00.000Z	appi_uppi	dr_willis	so we are doing encrypting twice
2011-11-15T11:52:00.000Z	appi_uppi	dr_willis	thought if I could use scp without encripting data?
2011-11-15T11:53:00.000Z	dr_willis	appi_uppi	 hmm. never seen an option for that. been reading the oreially ssh book this week. but im only on chapter 4
2011-11-15T11:54:00.000Z	appi_uppi	dr_willis	i have searched in web, but i see that scp cannot be used to unencrypt the data because we it warrants ssl
2011-11-15T11:54:00.000Z	appi_uppi	dr_willis	still not sure
2011-11-15T11:55:00.000Z	dr_willis	appi_uppi	 for my simple needs. i doubt if id even notice any speed differances. guess transfering big files you would.
2011-11-15T11:56:00.000Z	appi_uppi	dr_willis	yeah
2011-11-15T11:57:00.000Z	dr_willis	appi_uppi	 with that special hardware nfs may be a better way.. theres so many ways you could do it...
2011-11-15T11:58:00.000Z	appi_uppi	dr_willis	the hardware is silver peak
2011-11-15T11:59:00.000Z	dr_willis	appi_uppi	 means about as much to me as  greek ;) i just do home networkig.
2011-11-15T12:00:00.000Z	appi_uppi	dr_willis	heh heh
