2009-11-24T11:25:00.000Z	manug	fred321	-- you should, it's fun! =)
2009-11-24T11:22:00.000Z	manug	fred321	-- that is plenty
2009-11-24T11:22:00.000Z	manug	fred321	and yes, ubuntu can read ntfs, although you could just format to something elsee
2009-11-24T11:31:00.000Z	manug	fred321	i think there is a native version of quake iii arena for linux
2009-11-24T11:31:00.000Z	manug	fred321	-- https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Games/Native/QuakeIIIArena
2009-11-24T11:32:00.000Z	manug	fred321	-- it depends on the game
2009-11-24T11:32:00.000Z	manug	fred321	generally it will probably be a bit slower, but some games run VERY well on wine
2009-11-24T11:33:00.000Z	manug	fred321	-- look at this page for some well supported software http://appdb.winehq.org/
2009-11-24T11:35:00.000Z	manug	fred321	-- i think ubuntu's installer can take care of this
