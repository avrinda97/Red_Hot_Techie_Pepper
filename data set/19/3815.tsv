2009-12-15T14:01:00.000Z	q0_0p		any can help me why when i mount my usb the permissions change where only root can see it
2009-12-15T14:03:00.000Z	kuttans	q0_0p	change the permission on the /dev/Your Usb drive and then re plug it you will get it
2009-12-15T14:03:00.000Z	q0_0p	kuttans	how do i do that
2009-12-15T14:04:00.000Z	q0_0p	kuttans	that makes sense
2009-12-15T14:04:00.000Z	q0_0p	kuttans	i didn't think about doing it recursively
2009-12-15T14:04:00.000Z	q0_0p	kuttans	cool thx
2009-12-15T14:05:00.000Z	q0_0p	kuttans	i did chmod 777 and it would only do that folder only
2009-12-15T14:05:00.000Z	q0_0p	kuttans	i didn't want to do it for every single folder
2009-12-15T14:05:00.000Z	q0_0p	kuttans	chmod -R solved it thx
2009-12-15T14:10:00.000Z	q0_0p	kuttans	one more question when i do chmod -R 777 /mnt i can only read everything but cannot execute
2009-12-15T14:11:00.000Z	q0_0p	kuttans	i assume it changed permissions for all the folders but not the files within the folder
2009-12-15T14:11:00.000Z	q0_0p	kuttans	then i tried chmod 777 * but it fails
2009-12-15T14:12:00.000Z	kuttans	q0_0p	if you know the exe well enough then use sudo
2009-12-15T14:13:00.000Z	q0_0p	kuttans	but i dont want to use sudo everytime
2009-12-15T14:13:00.000Z	q0_0p	kuttans	i just want to play mp3s through mplayer
2009-12-15T14:13:00.000Z	q0_0p	kuttans	that would suck to type in sudo every time for that :)
2009-12-15T14:16:00.000Z	kuttans	q0_0p	did you ever tampered udev-rules files??
2009-12-15T14:16:00.000Z	q0_0p	kuttans	i dont think i ever did
2009-12-15T14:16:00.000Z	q0_0p	kuttans	i'm not using ubuntu
