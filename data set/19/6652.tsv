2008-03-26T01:38:00.000Z	Leechzilla		I type sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 start but nothing happens. It just takes me to the next prompt without doing anything
2008-03-26T01:38:00.000Z	un0p	Leechzilla	it means all is good -- continue on to the next step
2008-03-26T01:39:00.000Z	Leechzilla	un0p	what next step?
2008-03-26T01:39:00.000Z	un0p	Leechzilla	i dunno, whatever it is you need to do after starting apache
2008-03-26T01:39:00.000Z	Leechzilla	un0p	It's not starting, is what I'm saying
2008-03-26T01:40:00.000Z	un0p	Leechzilla	sudo /etc/init.c/apache2 restart
2008-03-26T01:40:00.000Z	Leechzilla	un0p	It doesn't do anything
2008-03-26T01:40:00.000Z	un0p	Leechzilla	does it even say anything?
2008-03-26T01:40:00.000Z	Leechzilla	un0p	Nope
2008-03-26T01:40:00.000Z	un0p	Leechzilla	is apache even installed?? I really wonder
2008-03-26T01:41:00.000Z	Leechzilla		un0p? Yeah it's installed
2008-03-26T01:41:00.000Z	un0p	Leechzilla	that's not normal, if i were you, i would reinstall apache -- sudo apt-get install --reinstall apache2
2008-03-26T01:41:00.000Z	Leechzilla	un0p	I did that too, still no luck
2008-03-26T01:42:00.000Z	un0p	Leechzilla	have you tried browsing to http://localhost ?
2008-03-26T01:42:00.000Z	Leechzilla		un0p; yes
2008-03-26T01:42:00.000Z	un0p	Leechzilla	ok, and?
2008-03-26T01:42:00.000Z	Leechzilla		un0p; unable to connect
2008-03-26T01:44:00.000Z	un0p	Leechzilla	ok, have a look in your log files -- grep -i apache /var/log/{syslog,debug} | less  -- see what you can make off the failure to start
2008-03-26T01:45:00.000Z	Leechzilla	un0p	no error messages there
