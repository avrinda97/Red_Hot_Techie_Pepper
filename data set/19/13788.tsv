2005-09-15T11:43:00.000Z	charlesj		how do i create a shortcut for a command that is run so: "./commandname --options" ?
2005-09-15T11:44:00.000Z	HappyFool	charlesj	right click on desktop, choose 'create launcher'
2005-09-15T11:44:00.000Z	HappyFool	charlesj	/path/to/the/program --options
2005-09-15T11:47:00.000Z	HappyFool	charlesj	standby, let me try it
2005-09-15T11:51:00.000Z	HappyFool	charlesj	it works here as i expect
2005-09-15T11:52:00.000Z	HappyFool	charlesj	does the command work from the command line?
2005-09-15T11:55:00.000Z	HappyFool	charlesj	has *not* been compiled?
2005-09-15T11:55:00.000Z	HappyFool	charlesj	but you said it runs from the command line fine ?
2005-09-15T11:56:00.000Z	HappyFool	charlesj	you need to specify the path to the program (i.e., /home/charlesj/software/cybercomm/foo)
2005-09-15T11:56:00.000Z	HappyFool	charlesj	not './cybercomm'
2005-09-15T11:58:00.000Z	HappyFool	charlesj	where exactly is the client file? in your home directory?
2005-09-15T11:59:00.000Z	HappyFool	charlesj	and by '/path' do you actually mean '/home/charlesj/whatever' ?
2005-09-15T12:00:00.000Z	HappyFool	charlesj	ok, does '/path/crclient -u asdf' work from a different folder?
2005-09-15T12:00:00.000Z	HappyFool	charlesj	ok, it might be easiest to write a little wrapper script to first change to the right directory, then run the program
2005-09-15T12:01:00.000Z	HappyFool	charlesj	it's very easy; the file will have two lines: 'cd /path' and './crclient -u asdf'
2005-09-15T12:02:00.000Z	HappyFool	charlesj	yip. make sure to mark it executable (chmod a+x myscript.sh)
2005-09-15T12:02:00.000Z	HappyFool	charlesj	you can also set executable from nautilus (the gnome file explorer)
2005-09-15T12:02:00.000Z	HappyFool	charlesj	cool. good luck
2005-09-15T12:07:00.000Z	HappyFool	charlesj	great :)
