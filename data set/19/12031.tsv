2005-10-21T12:59:00.000Z	starscalling	sn9	from inside that folder that im trying to compile?
2005-10-21T13:01:00.000Z	sn9	starscalling	sudo apt-get build-deps xchat
2005-10-21T13:01:00.000Z	sn9	starscalling	sudo apt-get build-dep xchat
2005-10-21T13:03:00.000Z	sn9	starscalling	you need to have deb-src lines in your /etc/apt/sources.list
2005-10-21T13:03:00.000Z	sn9	starscalling	build-dep gets all the pkgs you need to build something
2005-10-21T13:05:00.000Z	sn9	starscalling	build-dep will correct the error in your pastebin
2005-10-21T13:33:00.000Z	sn9	starscalling	depends on the program
2005-10-21T13:34:00.000Z	sn9	starscalling	you're not replacing the old one anyway
2005-10-21T13:34:00.000Z	sn9	starscalling	that removes the old one
2005-10-21T13:37:00.000Z	starscalling	sn9	you said if i make install im not replacing the old one anyway? that would only happen if i made a package out of it or something? so if i have trouble from my make-install how do i get it out of my system?
2005-10-21T13:38:00.000Z	sn9	starscalling	you shouldn't make pkgs out of stuff that puts itself in /usr/local
2005-10-21T13:40:00.000Z	sn9	starscalling	it's too late for a custom dir, which you shouldn't use anyway
