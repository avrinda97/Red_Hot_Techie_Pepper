2012-06-18T21:00:00.000Z	iLogical		Please. I need thunderbird to the version 8.0 to work with the calendar add-on
2012-06-18T21:01:00.000Z	iLogical		downgrade*
2012-06-18T21:01:00.000Z	iLogical		a*
2012-06-18T21:01:00.000Z	iLogical		how can I do that?
2012-06-18T21:02:00.000Z	emobathtub	iLogical	You can actually open the plug in manually and edit the versions allowed. I forgot how to do it but. A quick google should suffice
2012-06-18T21:06:00.000Z	emobathtub	iLogical	Which plugin are you using
2012-06-18T21:08:00.000Z	emobathtub	iLogical	Add-on, rather. Should be able to go to their website and download a .xml or similar for the plugin, then you can right click it and open it in your text editor and there will be a line with allowed versions, change it to reflect your version number, bam.
2012-06-18T21:08:00.000Z	iLogical	emobathtub	ok
2012-06-18T21:09:00.000Z	iLogical	emobathtub	it's a .xpi :(
2012-06-18T21:10:00.000Z	emobathtub	iLogical	File extensions mean nothing, right click it and try to open it in gedit
2012-06-18T21:12:00.000Z	emobathtub	iLogical	Hm. I forgot how to do it. It might be zipped or something. Try Googling "editing firefox add ons for versions"
2012-06-18T21:17:00.000Z	iLogical	emobathtub	oh no. it workds for 13.0, 13.1, I have 12.0
2012-06-18T21:19:00.000Z	emobathtub	iLogical	So modify it, and see if it works.
2012-06-18T21:23:00.000Z	iLogical	emobathtub	I will just upgrade. Thanks!
2012-06-18T21:23:00.000Z	emobathtub	iLogical	Sounds good :)
2012-06-18T21:37:00.000Z	iLogical	emobathtub	guess what, I can't install the add-on because dayly 16.0b isn't compatible :(
2012-06-18T21:37:00.000Z	emobathtub	iLogical	So you're going to have to do what I said haha. Unfortunate
2012-06-18T21:46:00.000Z	iLogical	emobathtub	I just downloaded the last version on their website HAHAHAH
2012-06-18T21:46:00.000Z	iLogical	emobathtub	and it worked
