2007-06-27T13:21:00.000Z	abhi_	Flannel	u have any idea why i'm facing this strange problem?
2008-07-16T11:08:00.000Z	Flannel	abhi_	What are you having a problem with?
2008-07-16T11:09:00.000Z	abhi_	Flannel	: i just want to schedule a command with crontab. i have tried all the tricks but without any result.
2008-07-16T11:10:00.000Z	Flannel	abhi_	There shouldn't be any tricks.  What command are you trying to run? when? and whats the entry in your crontab currently?
2008-07-16T11:11:00.000Z	abhi_	Flannel	 45 10 * * * /usr/bin/pcmanfm. just testing
2008-07-16T11:12:00.000Z	Flannel	abhi_	pastebin the output of `crontab -l` please
2008-07-16T11:14:00.000Z	abhi_	Flannel	http://paste.ubuntu.com/27651/
2008-07-16T11:15:00.000Z	Flannel	abhi_	And what times/whatever are you under the impression this should run at?
2008-07-16T11:16:00.000Z	abhi_	Flannel	every day at 10.45
2008-07-16T11:18:00.000Z	Flannel	abhi_	Is there a line under that entry?
2008-07-16T11:18:00.000Z	Flannel	abhi_	(as in, you have a newline at the end of that line)
2008-07-16T11:18:00.000Z	abhi_	Flannel	: yes
2008-07-16T11:19:00.000Z	abhi_	Flannel	: this is bug not to have a newline at the end. i know that.
2008-07-16T11:20:00.000Z	Flannel	abhi_	Cron uses system time, doesn't it?  that'd be UTC?
2008-07-16T11:21:00.000Z	abhi_	Flannel	: i d't think so...
2008-07-16T11:22:00.000Z	Flannel	abhi_	Its not 1045 UTC, is it?  (or was it when we tried?)  Try doing something every 10 minutes or something, see if that works (since that's independant of the timezone question)
2008-07-16T11:23:00.000Z	abhi_	Flannel	: so i will add this:     */10 * * * * cmd
2008-07-16T11:23:00.000Z	Flannel	abhi_	yes
2008-07-16T11:36:00.000Z	abhi_	Flannel	: it does't work even for every 10 min.
