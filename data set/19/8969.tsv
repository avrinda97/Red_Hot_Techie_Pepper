2008-12-21T03:39:00.000Z	Taladan		I'm trying to find some accounting software that will run on Ubuntu/Kubuntu that can take the place of Quickbooks (or even read QB company files if possible)
2008-12-21T03:40:00.000Z	sgorf	Taladan	gnucash
2008-12-21T03:40:00.000Z	Taladan	sgorf	will it handle small to medium business/enterprise?
2008-12-21T03:40:00.000Z	sgorf	Taladan	Depends on what features you need. Probably best to have a play with it.
2008-12-21T03:42:00.000Z	sgorf	Taladan	Have you looked into Wine/Crossover stuff? gnucash would be fine for bookkeeping data entry
2008-12-21T03:42:00.000Z	sgorf	Taladan	It can do invoicing and stuff too, but I do that by hand
2008-12-21T03:42:00.000Z	sgorf	Taladan	Really you need a specific set of requirements
2008-12-21T03:43:00.000Z	Taladan	sgorf	I realize that, but keep in mind this isn't just for one business...it's for approximately 20 different ones
2008-12-21T03:44:00.000Z	sgorf	Taladan	In that case, I can almost guarantee that all the features they all use won't be available on gnucash, or really anything else for that matter.
2008-12-21T03:44:00.000Z	sgorf	Taladan	That happens any time you move anyone to a different piece of software
2008-12-21T03:45:00.000Z	sgorf	Taladan	Oooh, look into sql ledger
2008-12-21T03:51:00.000Z	sgorf	Taladan	I _think_ gnucash can import Quickbooks. No idea about versions. I get the impression that the Quickbooks format is reasonably well understood
2008-12-21T03:53:00.000Z	sgorf	Taladan	I think that the best option is crossover office, tbh. Buy the official Codeweavers version and see what support they'll give you.
2008-12-21T03:53:00.000Z	sgorf	Taladan	I use gnucash and am happy with it. But people in general wouldn't like the change
2008-12-21T03:54:00.000Z	Taladan	sgorf	yeah, that's something I've thought about, but I'm trying to see if I can migrate people away from QB altogether...all of this stuff is dependent upon what the CPA tells me as far as usability of the various pieces of software.
2008-12-21T03:55:00.000Z	sgorf	Taladan	Maybe do it in two stages - first, move them to Quickbooks with wine, then they get the benefits of the rest of the system and get a chance to like it. Then they'd be more open to switching away from Quickbooks
2008-12-21T03:56:00.000Z	Taladan	sgorf	Yeah, that's something that I've thought about, as well as using virtualization with an XP install to run QB on.
