2010-05-09T16:28:00.000Z	cherwin	greezmunkey	I have absolutely no idea, but _if_ it has trouble resolving, we will know after this..
2010-05-09T16:29:00.000Z	greezmunkey	cherwin	agreed
2010-05-09T16:54:00.000Z	greezmunkey	cherwin	you could look at the ifup ifupdown scripts, maybe umount there would clean things up a bit.
2010-05-09T16:56:00.000Z	cherwin	greezmunkey	that's a good idea
2010-05-09T16:57:00.000Z	greezmunkey	cherwin	It's definately not a standard thing, and shoudl be documented for that computer, but it should help.
2010-05-09T17:33:00.000Z	cherwin	greezmunkey	kudos for trying so hard.
2010-05-09T17:42:00.000Z	greezmunkey	cherwin	did you see the link I pasted to ravenkhan ?
2010-05-09T17:43:00.000Z	cherwin	greezmunkey	No, why?

2010-05-09T17:44:00.000Z	greezmunkey	cherwin	It looks like his ubuntu wubi may have blown up due to update manager??
2010-05-09T17:47:00.000Z	cherwin	greezmunkey	Indeed.
2010-05-09T17:48:00.000Z	cherwin	greezmunkey	Nice find!
2010-05-09T17:48:00.000Z	greezmunkey	cherwin	looks like he left, maybe he's working through that document (keep your fingers crossed!)
2010-05-09T17:49:00.000Z	greezmunkey	cherwin	if #ubuntu has done anything for me, it has increased my google-fu :)
