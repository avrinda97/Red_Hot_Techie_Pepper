2006-04-12T05:22:00.000Z	krollian		I installed Ubuntu 5.10, but the it doesn't get my video card.  Thought I might need to upgrade x windows.  Is there an easy way?
2006-04-12T05:22:00.000Z	krollian		I don't understand the instructions I found
2006-04-12T05:23:00.000Z	mue1	krollian	autodetecting just probably didn't get it
2006-04-12T05:23:00.000Z	mue1	krollian	just reconfigure your x-server
2006-04-12T05:24:00.000Z	mue1	krollian	most probably your settings are just wrong
2006-04-12T05:24:00.000Z	mue1	krollian	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2006-04-12T05:24:00.000Z	mue1	krollian	what video hardware do you have?
2006-04-12T05:25:00.000Z	mue1	krollian	do you need hardware acceleration?
2006-04-12T05:25:00.000Z	mue1	krollian	2d garphics works fine without it
2006-04-12T05:26:00.000Z	mue1	krollian	3d graphics may be a bit tricky with your card
2006-04-12T05:26:00.000Z	mue1	krollian	I believe you can get into text mode
2006-04-12T05:27:00.000Z	mue1	krollian	yes, but it's good to learn
2006-04-12T05:27:00.000Z	mue1	krollian	I don't think that'll work
2006-04-12T05:28:00.000Z	mue1	krollian	put the following command to the text prompt
2006-04-12T05:31:00.000Z	mue1	krollian	did you get it?
2006-04-12T05:31:00.000Z	krollian	mue1	would you talk to me on a different messenger?
2006-04-12T05:31:00.000Z	mue1	krollian	yes
2006-04-12T05:32:00.000Z	mue1	krollian	I don't have a yahoo account...
