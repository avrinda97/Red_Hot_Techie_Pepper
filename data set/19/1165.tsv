2011-06-17T06:42:00.000Z	escott	SubCool	you dont get any video in skype? can you select the camera in skype?
2011-06-17T06:42:00.000Z	SubCool	escott	there is only one option in skype.. And no- no video.
2011-06-17T06:43:00.000Z	escott	SubCool	you could try using LD_PRELOAD to force skype to use v4l2 library it might work
2011-06-17T06:44:00.000Z	escott	SubCool	#!/bin/bash \n export LIBV4LCONTROL_FLAGS=3 \n LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib32/libv4l/v4l1compat.so skype
2011-06-17T06:44:00.000Z	escott	SubCool	if you are 32bit install it would be /usr/lib instead of /usr/lib32
2011-06-17T06:45:00.000Z	escott	SubCool	im honestly not sure what the V4L control flags do. try it without, then try it with
