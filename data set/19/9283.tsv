2007-03-12T13:50:00.000Z	genii	allyer	How much RAM does the box have?
2007-03-12T13:51:00.000Z	genii	allyer	Is it an Intel or AMD and single core or not?
2007-03-12T13:51:00.000Z	genii	allyer	Put as a kernel option before booting: notsc
2007-03-12T13:53:00.000Z	genii	allyer	Use the alternate install cdrom. It will give you a page which lets you do things like text install or so on not on regular install cdrom. From the main menu there you can modify the parameters it is using to boot
2007-03-12T13:53:00.000Z	genii	allyer	Yes, if that works on your cd
2007-03-12T13:54:00.000Z	genii	allyer	Anyhow, for dual-core amd the notsc  option works often to get the installer working.
2007-03-12T13:55:00.000Z	genii	allyer	No, it is a parameter to the kernel regarding cpu clock cycles
2007-03-12T13:56:00.000Z	genii	allyer	Go to the end of the line it gives you and add   notsc
2007-03-12T13:57:00.000Z	genii	allyer	OK. If still issues report back
