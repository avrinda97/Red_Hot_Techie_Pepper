2006-11-18T17:24:00.000Z	wraithsoul		I was here last night, and I still need help
2006-11-18T17:25:00.000Z	wraithsoul		How do I make panels go behind applications?
2006-11-18T17:27:00.000Z	synjet	wraithsoul	right-click the top panel and properties: hide
2006-11-18T17:27:00.000Z	wraithsoul		thanks
2006-11-18T17:28:00.000Z	wraithsoul	synjet	that just causes the panel to fly off screen.
2006-11-18T17:30:00.000Z	synjet	wraithsoul	if you want the active window to be over a panel, I guess full-screen is the easiest option, as in a browser: F-11
2006-11-18T17:30:00.000Z	wraithsoul		is that really the best that can be done?
2006-11-18T17:30:00.000Z	wraithsoul		Does Beep not know what architexture beep has?
2006-11-18T17:31:00.000Z	synjet	wraithsoul	atleast the one that I use/think of..
2006-11-18T17:31:00.000Z	wraithsoul		xchat does not do it.
2006-11-18T17:32:00.000Z	wraithsoul		basically I have a starcraft screen shot, and am using it as a background. I want the part of the screen shot that says "menu" to open the menu. But I cannot find either a command to do it with gDesklets or a way to make the panel it is on go under the application.
2006-11-18T17:34:00.000Z	synjet	wraithsoul	why does the screenshot have the "menu" part on it? if you want just the screenshot, then press alt-printscreen
2006-11-18T17:34:00.000Z	wraithsoul		:/
2006-11-18T17:34:00.000Z	wraithsoul		starcraft has a panel for commanding troops and such.
2006-11-18T17:34:00.000Z	synjet	wraithsoul	that would get the screenshot of the active window
2006-11-18T17:35:00.000Z	wraithsoul	synjet	have you played the game?
2006-11-18T17:35:00.000Z	synjet	wraithsoul	nope :) thats where I misunderstood you, my wrong
2006-11-18T17:35:00.000Z	wraithsoul	synjet	it is fine
