2008-04-24T09:07:00.000Z	nickrud	kmg	here's mine: /dev/scd0       /media/cdrom0   udf,iso9660 user,noauto,exec,utf8 0       0
2008-04-24T09:09:00.000Z	kmg	nickrud	permission denied
2008-04-24T09:09:00.000Z	nickrud	kmg	not sure then. can you read it as root?
2008-04-24T09:10:00.000Z	kmg	nickrud	yes, i can.
2008-04-24T09:10:00.000Z	nickrud	kmg	and, your user needs to be in the cdrom group
2008-04-24T09:11:00.000Z	nickrud	kmg	you can check that by typing   groups   in the terminal. If it isn't,   sudo adduser <user> cdrom, log out and log back in (the logging is required)
2008-04-24T09:11:00.000Z	kmg	nickrud	when I do 'groups box' (my username) cdrom is in there
2008-04-24T09:11:00.000Z	nickrud	kmg	what's the permissions on your scd?  . should be 660
2008-04-24T09:13:00.000Z	kmg	nickrud	they're 660
2008-04-24T09:13:00.000Z	kmg	nickrud	I did sudo chmod 660 /dev/scd0 and no change
2008-04-24T09:13:00.000Z	nickrud	kmg	no real clue then.
2008-04-24T09:14:00.000Z	kmg	nickrud	=C
