2008-02-12T20:54:00.000Z	Shirakawasuna		Hi.  I use archlinux, not ubuntu, but I was wondering if someone could confirm something which I suspect is universal.  Has anyone here compared EXA performance vs. XAA performance with an intel 915gm card or related?  On my computer, EXA is a bit laggier/draws slowly when viewing youtube or changing windows, while XAA is perfect.
