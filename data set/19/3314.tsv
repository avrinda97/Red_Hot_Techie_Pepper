2009-09-14T02:34:00.000Z	jiksun		hi all, can you someone pls help me with fixing wireless on a brand new hp mini 110?
2009-09-14T02:35:00.000Z	RHorse	jiksun	can you be a lil more specific?
2009-09-14T02:36:00.000Z	jiksun	RHorse	- sure, I've just installed UNR, and my netbook is running Broadcom STA wireless - it can detect networks, but it doesn't connect for some reaso
2009-09-14T02:37:00.000Z	RHorse	jiksun	uggh! broadcom
2009-09-14T02:38:00.000Z	jiksun	RHorse	- yeah I know! I haven't been able to find much about it online. Is this a common problem?
2009-09-14T02:38:00.000Z	RHorse	jiksun	which model?
2009-09-14T02:40:00.000Z	jiksun	RHorse	- Broadcom 4312 wireless with ubuntu netbook remix
2009-09-14T02:41:00.000Z	RHorse	jiksun	9.04?
2009-09-14T02:41:00.000Z	jiksun	RHorse	- yeah the netbook version of 9.04
2009-09-14T02:42:00.000Z	jiksun		Froglet - Nope, it's the HP Mini 110 - 1059tu
2009-09-14T02:43:00.000Z	RHorse	jiksun	the netbook remix is irrelevant - the kernel is the same
2009-09-14T02:44:00.000Z	RHorse	jiksun	you can start here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1092870
2009-09-14T02:44:00.000Z	jiksun	RHorse	- ah, I see. I was going to try the regular version and see if that would make any difference, but I guess not then.
2009-09-14T02:44:00.000Z	jiksun	RHorse	- hey thanks, I'll check it out now.
2009-09-14T02:46:00.000Z	RHorse	jiksun	want to do a few tests on the command line?
2009-09-14T02:47:00.000Z	jiksun	RHorse	- sure thing, what do you want me to type?
2009-09-14T02:48:00.000Z	RHorse	jiksun	PM the results of iwconfig
2009-09-14T02:49:00.000Z	RHorse	jiksun	wait a sec! that box has a pcmcia slot?
2009-09-14T02:50:00.000Z	jiksun	RHorse	- no it doesn't, why?
