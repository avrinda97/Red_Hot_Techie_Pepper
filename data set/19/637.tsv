2012-10-27T11:56:00.000Z	Notimik		hm why is no fw enabled by default on ubuntu?
2012-10-27T11:56:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Notimik	fw?
2012-10-27T11:56:00.000Z	gordonjcp		it depends what firmware you want, surely
2012-10-27T11:56:00.000Z	Notimik		GoGi: firewall
2012-10-27T11:56:00.000Z	Notimik	gordonjcp	firewall
2012-10-27T11:56:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Notimik	oh, firewall
2012-10-27T11:56:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Notimik	it's not something you really need
2012-10-27T11:57:00.000Z	Notimik	gordonjcp	but i guess we have alot of open ports on by deafult?
2012-10-27T11:57:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Notimik	it depends what you're doing
2012-10-27T11:58:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Notimik	generally you don't have any ports open unless you specifically start up a server
2012-10-27T11:58:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Notimik	you don't need a firewall on a desktop machine, in any sane configuration
2012-10-27T11:59:00.000Z	Notimik	gordonjcp	ok..
2012-10-27T11:59:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Notimik	normally a desktop is going to be behind NAT, or some other sort of router
2012-10-27T12:00:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Notimik	you pretty much don't just hook a desktop straight up to an internet connection any more
2012-10-27T12:00:00.000Z	Notimik	gordonjcp	mm have an spi firewall in my router. but on a laptop you connect directly from time to time
2012-10-27T12:01:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Notimik	connect directly through what?
2012-10-27T12:01:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Notimik	if you're on 3G you're behind NAT...
2012-10-27T12:01:00.000Z	Notimik	gordonjcp	thru a usb dongle for example
2012-10-27T12:02:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Notimik	yeah, so on 3G?  That's NATted
