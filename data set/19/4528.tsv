2008-12-28T09:20:00.000Z	Firky		Hey people
2008-12-28T09:21:00.000Z	Firky		Why dose Ubuntu run so slow on my laptop compared to Windows XP ?
2008-12-28T09:22:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Firky	Try turning off compiz effects and telling us what hardware you are running or compare your hardware to our list of supported hardware
2008-12-28T09:24:00.000Z	Firky	Jack_Sparrow	 thing is when my system monitor reads CPU usuage at around 77% but when I look at the processes it only shows around 4% being used ??
2008-12-28T09:25:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Firky	sounds like it isnt reading something correctly
2008-12-28T09:25:00.000Z	Firky	Jack_Sparrow	Hmm..I cant think what else would be running thats causing so much CPU power to be used.... ive only just started using Ubuntu...
2008-12-28T09:26:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Firky	Is it a real install or some vm or worse.. wubi install
2008-12-28T09:26:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Firky	what exactly does lsb_release -a give you in a term.. exactly
2008-12-28T09:27:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Firky	It is when you are running windows and insert the disk and it installs while you are running windows
2008-12-28T09:29:00.000Z	Firky	Jack_Sparrow	http://paste.ubuntu.com/94073/
2008-12-28T09:32:00.000Z	Firky	Jack_Sparrow	  do you have any ideas to why my CPU is reading so much usage ?
2008-12-28T09:32:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Firky	You are getting two different reading so how are you sure it really is eating up cpu
2008-12-28T09:49:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Firky	Could tracker have been eating cpus while logging your dive.  DFId you see disk activity
2008-12-28T09:50:00.000Z	Firky	Jack_Sparrow	 why would it do that ?
2008-12-28T09:51:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Firky	Easy to understand if it was tracker
2008-12-29T05:17:00.000Z	Firky	Jack_Sparrow	 do you know why only 1 window at a time will ever play sound on Ubuntu ????????????
2008-12-29T05:18:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Firky	common problem.. should be easy to fix...  alsa or pulse..
2008-12-29T05:20:00.000Z	Firky	Jack_Sparrow	what are those ??
2008-12-29T05:21:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Firky	alsa and pulseaudio are the two different types os sound architecture for a better choice of words.  /#alsa has a channel and #pulseaudio I think has one
