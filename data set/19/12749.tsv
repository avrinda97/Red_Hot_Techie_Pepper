2005-07-12T13:14:00.000Z	Seveas	BlueSummer_id	you don't have to spam for Ubuntu in here :)
2005-07-12T13:16:00.000Z	BlueSummer_id	Seveas	 i didn't mean to my mouse wheel is paste for some bizzare reason lol
2005-07-12T13:27:00.000Z	Seveas	BlueSummer_id	aliases add an extra shell to be executed
2005-07-12T13:27:00.000Z	BlueSummer_id	Seveas	 ok
2005-07-12T13:27:00.000Z	Seveas	BlueSummer_id	closing the main terminal will close the subshell, which then will close steam (if i memorized it all correct)
2005-07-12T13:28:00.000Z	BlueSummer_id	Seveas	 I understand that but i thought the alias should remain there so i can type "steam" to open my program from any term
2005-07-12T13:28:00.000Z	Seveas	BlueSummer_id	create a simple shell function that does that
2005-07-12T13:29:00.000Z	BlueSummer_id	Seveas	 how?
2005-07-12T13:29:00.000Z	Seveas	BlueSummer_id	or use alias steam="cedega /path/to/steam.exe"
2005-07-12T13:29:00.000Z	Seveas	BlueSummer_id	hmm, I might have misunderstood your problem....
2005-07-12T13:30:00.000Z	BlueSummer_id	Seveas	 it's ok
2005-07-12T13:30:00.000Z	Seveas	BlueSummer_id	can you rephrase your problem
2005-07-12T13:36:00.000Z	BlueSummer_id	Seveas	 also thank you for your help
2005-07-12T14:42:00.000Z	Seveas	BlueSummer_id	dpkg -iinstall filename.deb
2005-07-12T14:43:00.000Z	Seveas	BlueSummer_id	dpkg --install filename.deb
