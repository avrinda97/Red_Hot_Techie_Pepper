2010-01-17T20:37:00.000Z	dupondje		hellow :) i'm using audacious, and playing music from a samba mount, but it seems like it gives 'clicks' sometimes
2010-01-17T20:38:00.000Z	dupondje		any idea what could be the reason ?
2010-01-17T20:39:00.000Z	jami	dupondje	i have bad cifs experiences too
2010-01-17T20:41:00.000Z	jami	dupondje	yes
2010-01-17T20:42:00.000Z	jami	dupondje	in my case the access is blocked for a some ms
2010-01-17T20:42:00.000Z	dupondje	jami	no fixes or bugreports of it ?
2010-01-17T20:42:00.000Z	jami	dupondje	nfs :)
2010-01-17T20:43:00.000Z	dupondje	jami	hard with a winblows box ;)
2010-01-17T20:45:00.000Z	jami	dupondje	full ack. A latence timeout is ok but this fuu.. reaking driver blocks the io
2010-01-17T20:50:00.000Z	dupondje	jami	you know if there is a bugreport about this issue ?
2010-01-17T20:53:00.000Z	jami	dupondje	nothing useable
2010-01-17T20:55:00.000Z	jami	dupondje	i decided to reformat my data stuff to ext4 and keep m$ as blob in a vm
2010-01-17T21:15:00.000Z	dupondje	jami	trying to debug a bit with wireshark, but it seems all correct
2010-01-17T21:16:00.000Z	dupondje	jami	Time from request: 0.218262000 seconds
2010-01-17T21:20:00.000Z	jami	dupondje	with wireshark? I guess the protocol flow on the samba share is well. But the local driver blocks for some reasons i dont know
2010-01-17T21:21:00.000Z	dupondje	jami	it lagged after the out-of-range reponse time :)
2010-01-17T21:36:00.000Z	dupondje	jami	did set rize to 124K, and didn't had any buffer error yet :)
2010-01-17T21:36:00.000Z	jami	dupondje	ok will try that thx
