2012-05-18T01:39:00.000Z	wiggmpk		Installed 12.04 (Desktop) on a 2nd harddrive (/dev/sdb) and It destroyed my MBR (/dev/sda) which now doesnt let me boot Windows 7 or Ubuntu 12.04. After using boot-repair, I am able to boot Ubuntu (/dev/sdb) but os-prober and grub-install will not and have not found my Windows 7 Install.. Not Happy.. plz help
2012-05-18T01:41:00.000Z	wiggmpk		Why is there NO option in the Desktop LiveCD version to leave the MBR untouched?
2012-05-18T01:42:00.000Z	wiggmpk		I want a solution that doesnt involve another piece of software (much like boot-repair that caused more damage than helped)
2012-05-18T01:44:00.000Z	wiggmpk		why does "sudo os-prober" NOT find my Windows 7 disk/partitions?
2012-05-18T01:46:00.000Z	wiggmpk		and I am familiar with boot-repair.. Ubuntu 12.04 Desktop LiveCD is the culprut.. not boot-repair..

2012-05-18T01:48:00.000Z	wiggmpk	TomatoKetchup	dont confuse rude with frustration
2012-05-18T01:49:00.000Z	TomatoKetchup	wiggmpk	nice excuse
2012-05-18T01:51:00.000Z	TomatoKetchup	wiggmpk	have you tried using the windows 7 repair install?
2012-05-18T01:51:00.000Z	TomatoKetchup	wiggmpk	then boot-repairing from the live cd see if that helps?
2012-05-18T01:52:00.000Z	TomatoKetchup	wiggmpk	just a suggestion because grub has had 0 problems detecting my windows 7 install
2012-05-18T01:53:00.000Z	TomatoKetchup	wiggmpk	which is why I'm thinking there is something wrong with it.
2012-05-18T01:53:00.000Z	TomatoKetchup	wiggmpk	I'd read over this thread - http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1855687
2012-05-18T01:55:00.000Z	TomatoKetchup	wiggmpk	sorry if you already posted, but what is your partition/drive setup like?
2012-05-18T01:57:00.000Z	TomatoKetchup	wiggmpk	the link I posted gave your instructions for fixing it yourself
2012-05-18T01:59:00.000Z	wiggmpk	TomatoKetchup	im not running scripts from forums on my machine
2012-05-18T01:59:00.000Z	wiggmpk	TomatoKetchup	apparently you didnt read it when I said I dont want any software
2012-05-18T02:01:00.000Z	TomatoKetchup	wiggmpk	frankly I don't like your attitude
2012-05-18T02:01:00.000Z	wiggmpk	TomatoKetchup	dualy noted
