2010-11-25T20:11:00.000Z	sipior	AbhiJit	you might try installing the libtiff-tools package, but that was from a couple years back, as i recall.
2010-11-25T20:12:00.000Z	AbhiJit	sipior	libtiff4 is already installed
2010-11-25T20:12:00.000Z	sipior	AbhiJit	i didn't say, "install libtiff4".
2010-11-25T20:13:00.000Z	sipior	AbhiJit	do you have libtiff-tools?
2010-11-25T20:13:00.000Z	AbhiJit	sipior	no
2011-01-25T18:51:00.000Z	sipior	AbhiJit	there's some support, depending on what you need. see here: http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.4/c99status.html
2011-01-25T18:51:00.000Z	AbhiJit	sipior	ok
2011-01-26T19:35:00.000Z	sipior	AbhiJit	i wasn't expecting your stratagem to work.
