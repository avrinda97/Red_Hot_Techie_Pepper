2010-09-03T06:26:00.000Z	edd_		Hi, I could do with some support installing Veejay.. I'm running  Ubuntu 10.04 on an athlon 64 dual core. I've added the relevant depository but am chasing a chain of dependencies. The bottom one seems to be libraw1394-8 which is not showing in the list. I do however have libraw1394-11 installed. Any ideas? :)
2010-09-03T06:27:00.000Z	randomusr_	edd_	have you tried installing from the synaptic package manager?
2010-09-03T06:28:00.000Z	randomusr_	edd_	if it's not in the supported repo's then you may want to check the website for the required dependencies
2010-09-03T06:31:00.000Z	randomusr_	edd_	have you checked the website from the program you want to install?  does it list the dependencies?
2010-09-03T06:31:00.000Z	randomusr_	edd_	if you're using synaptic then the dependencies should be assumed.... what's the program again?  is it supported?
2010-09-03T06:38:00.000Z	edd_	randomusr_	it's called veejay, but is a version rebuilt for ubuntu from Redhat?? packages... https://launchpad.net/~veejay/+archive/ppa
2010-09-03T06:40:00.000Z	randomusr_	edd_	yea.... that's hosted via ppa?
2010-09-03T06:41:00.000Z	edd_	randomusr_	I think so... admittedly i'm all new to this
2010-09-03T06:41:00.000Z	randomusr_	edd_	refer to the maintainer of the ppa site
2010-09-03T06:42:00.000Z	randomusr_	edd_	it looks as though you trying to do the more complicated before understanding the basics....
2010-09-03T06:43:00.000Z	edd_	randomusr_	I think i found a newer version (requires make install) but the download page says something about migrating to GIT... Does that just mean the page is down?
2010-09-03T06:43:00.000Z	randomusr_	edd_	that package it built from source (on the fly) and may not include the dependencies..... see google or wikipedia.org for GIT
2010-09-03T06:46:00.000Z	randomusr_	edd_	i suspect the that installer is prompting you for updating or that it's looking to settings in synaptic to resolve the deps.... Again see the PPA maintainer for help.
2010-09-03T06:47:00.000Z	randomusr_	edd_	 or just ask if anyone here has installed veejay successfully
2010-09-03T06:48:00.000Z	edd_	randomusr_	Thanks for your help, i'll try getting in touch with the PPA maintainer, failing that my *nix savvy mate is back from hols next week so should be able to look in to it
2010-09-03T06:48:00.000Z	randomusr_	edd_	did the installer say anything about requiring a particular version of glibc?
2010-09-03T06:49:00.000Z	randomusr_	edd_	 I think there's some command like whatrequires or something to determine missing deps
2010-09-03T06:49:00.000Z	randomusr_	edd_	anywho, good luck
2010-09-03T06:50:00.000Z	edd_	randomusr_	Thanks dude. Think this needs someone at the keyboard to fiddle!
