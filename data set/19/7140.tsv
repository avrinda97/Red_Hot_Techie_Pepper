2007-10-02T14:20:00.000Z	bieb		jimmygoon.. use knoppix or ubuntu live
2007-10-02T14:21:00.000Z	bieb		Jimmy.. you can also use shred
2007-10-02T14:22:00.000Z	exact	bieb	arent shred and wipe from the same package?
2007-10-02T14:22:00.000Z	bieb		ummm.. good question.. I havent used wipe before, but have used shred
2007-10-02T14:23:00.000Z	exact	bieb	nope, you're right, they're different packages
2007-10-02T14:23:00.000Z	exact		how can i determine what daemons are running and how to select which one to start up at boot time?
2007-10-02T14:24:00.000Z	exact		feisty 7.04 btw
2007-10-02T14:24:00.000Z	bieb	exact	I think shred is still the package the feds claim does the best job of clearing a drive so no trace of forensic data
2007-10-02T14:25:00.000Z	exact	bieb	i don't know who said what, but i'm quite sure that if you overwrite a file over 300 times with random data, someone who'd like to look at what was there will have a damn good time ;)
2007-10-02T14:28:00.000Z	bieb		By default shred overwrites a file 25 times with random data
2007-10-02T14:29:00.000Z	bieb		exact... here is the final answer for getting rid of data... For the extremely paranoid, however, no command works better than concentrated sulphuric acid. LOL
2007-10-02T14:29:00.000Z	exact		heh, funnily enough my random kde wallpaper is now set to guybrush threepwood (MI) holding a two headed squirrel (ZMK) in front of the purple tentacle (MM)... for all the lucas fan here, i can send a copy somewhere....
2007-10-02T14:29:00.000Z	exact	bieb	lol ;)
2007-10-02T14:29:00.000Z	bieb		KDE... just use apt-get install and see if that works
2007-10-02T14:30:00.000Z	exact	bieb	http://driveslag.eecue.com/
2007-10-02T14:30:00.000Z	bieb		KDE... see if that will install the package
2007-10-02T14:32:00.000Z	bieb		exact.. that is cool
2007-10-02T14:32:00.000Z	exact	bieb	i'm not sure if "cool" is the best term to describe it, but i'm quite sure you can say your data "bye bye" ;-)
