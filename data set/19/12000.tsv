2006-01-21T13:42:00.000Z	gimmulf	_jason	 theese emails is sent to my ubuntu user
2006-01-21T13:43:00.000Z	_jason	gimmulf	I see, how do you set that up?  If you have a keyword I could search or a link, that's all I'm looking for :)
2006-01-21T13:44:00.000Z	gimmulf	_jason	 i just think i some months ago tried to add something to crontab that got wrong and now the cron deamon sends theese mails becauce the think i tried to add does not work.
2006-01-21T13:45:00.000Z	gimmulf	_jason	 i havent done anything with mail i just use "mail" with standard configuration locally
2006-01-21T13:46:00.000Z	_jason	gimmulf	well while you wait for someone that knows more... have you tried reading pg-microsites-installer.php, or does that file not exist anywhere?
2006-01-21T13:47:00.000Z	gimmulf	_jason	 it doesnt exist
2006-01-21T13:48:00.000Z	_jason	gimmulf	lol sorry wrong name

2006-01-21T13:49:00.000Z	_jason	gimmulf	'locate microsites' turn up anything you can read?  after that I would search all the cron stuff for a mention of microsites
2006-01-21T13:50:00.000Z	gimmulf	_jason	 dont find anything, how do i list daily crontab stuff?
2006-01-21T13:51:00.000Z	_jason	gimmulf	do 'locate cron' and see if any of that stuff mentions microsites, I don't know exactly how ubuntu uses it.  i've only started reading about cron recently
2006-02-27T07:58:00.000Z	_jason	gimmulf	what is the filesystem type and have you set it up in fstab?
2006-02-27T07:59:00.000Z	gimmulf	_jason	 i dont have it there
2006-02-27T07:59:00.000Z	_jason	gimmulf	what is the filesystem type?
2006-02-27T07:59:00.000Z	gimmulf	_jason	 ext2 i think
2006-02-27T08:00:00.000Z	_jason	gimmulf	mount -t ext2 /dev/foo /mount/point
