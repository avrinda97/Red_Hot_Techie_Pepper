2005-07-30T05:56:00.000Z	jwb		gamemaster: can you expand on "external" a bit?  is this a powerbook?
2005-07-30T05:57:00.000Z	jwb		gamemaster: on a mac, you should have no problem installing and booting from a 1394 disk.
2005-07-30T05:57:00.000Z	jwb		gamemaster: much harder on a pc, i'm afraid
2005-07-30T05:58:00.000Z	jwb		gamemaster: you don't see it in the installer?  you might need to load the "sbp2" module
2005-07-30T05:59:00.000Z	codecaine	jwb	how would gamemaster do that?  in installer, jump to another console and load that?
2005-07-30T05:59:00.000Z	jwb	codecaine	that's how i usually do it
2005-07-30T06:00:00.000Z	codecaine	jwb	wouldn't he need to rescan hardware somehow?
