2007-11-21T02:51:00.000Z	firebird619		Could someone help me? When I try to open anything under System ==> Administration, I get this message "Failed to run /usr/sbin/synaptic as user root. Unable to copy the user's Xauthorization file." What can I did to fix this?
2007-11-21T02:51:00.000Z	ikonia	firebird619	are you runnning the Xserver ?
2007-11-21T02:51:00.000Z	ikonia	firebird619	are you using sudo or running as root
2007-11-21T02:53:00.000Z	firebird619	ikonia	Yes, I am running X (GUI). I had to reconfigure xserver when the PC started to use nv, because when I tried nvidia, it said get-edid wasn't installed.
2007-11-21T02:53:00.000Z	ikonia	firebird619	are you running as root or using a sudo method
2007-11-21T02:55:00.000Z	firebird619	ikonia	I never run as root, I always used sudo. I click System, then Administration, and then click on whatever I want to use, it then asks for the password and then that message shows up.
2007-11-21T02:55:00.000Z	ikonia	firebird619	remove the .Xauthority file
2007-11-21T02:57:00.000Z	firebird619	ikonia	Ok, I did that. Do I have to restart for it to take effect?
2007-11-21T02:57:00.000Z	ikonia	firebird619	to be honest, I'm not %100 certain, probably
2007-11-21T02:57:00.000Z	ikonia	firebird619	as in restart X - logout and back in , don't reboot
2007-11-21T02:58:00.000Z	firebird619	ikonia	Ok, I will try to restart X and see what happens. Thanks for the help. I may be back if I am still having problems.
2007-11-21T03:03:00.000Z	firebird619	ikonia	I am still having the same problem. I am under Failsafe GNOME now. When I tried to logon now normally, it said "Your session only lasted less than 10 seconds. If you have not logged out yourself, this could mean that there is some installation problem or that you may be out of diskspace.
2007-11-21T03:04:00.000Z	ikonia	firebird619	the most common problems for that is 1.) you don't have permissions to write to your home directory 2.) your out of disk space
2007-11-21T03:05:00.000Z	firebird619	ikonia	Wow, I have basically nothing installed but a few programs and / is 100 full. I guess thats the problem.
2007-11-21T03:05:00.000Z	ikonia	firebird619	spot on
2007-11-21T03:06:00.000Z	firebird619	ikonia	I will have to investigate now what the world is taking up all of that space.
2007-11-21T03:06:00.000Z	ikonia	firebird619	enjoy
2007-11-21T03:07:00.000Z	firebird619	ikonia	What the world could have happened? Everything was fine yesterday. I do have LVM so I could always add more to /, but I still want to know what is taking up all that space.
2007-11-21T03:07:00.000Z	ikonia	firebird619	investigate
