2012-10-22T09:14:00.000Z	Froward		alright ubuntu developer peoples, I said I was really proud of you for magicking my volume control hotkeys to not be delayed anymore
2012-10-22T09:14:00.000Z	Froward		but I'm TAKING IT BACK
2012-10-22T09:15:00.000Z	Froward		because a few reboots later, they don't work anymore
2012-10-22T09:15:00.000Z	Froward		was it an update? is it an intermittent bug? who knows!?
2012-10-22T09:15:00.000Z	Froward		I'm disappointed in you, developer dudes
2012-10-22T09:15:00.000Z	Froward		I am so sad
2012-10-22T09:17:00.000Z	Froward		oh, okay. thanks.
2012-10-22T09:18:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	Froward	haha, silly user. You forgot to enable the flux capacitor's /0 macro.
2012-10-22T09:18:00.000Z	Froward		man I unno I'm just frustrated
2012-10-22T09:19:00.000Z	Froward		you're right, Parsnip.
2012-10-22T09:19:00.000Z	Froward		sorry for the rant, everyone.
2012-10-22T09:20:00.000Z	Froward		boot to an older kernel, eh?
2012-10-22T09:21:00.000Z	Froward		got it!
2012-10-22T09:21:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	Froward	do you get input from the keys using xev?
2012-10-22T09:22:00.000Z	Froward	Seven_Six_Two	I don't know!
2012-10-22T09:22:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	Froward	run xev in a terminal. put your mouse in the box, then do the media keys. Look in the terminal for output (events)
2012-10-22T09:25:00.000Z	Froward	Seven_Six_Two	media keys don't output anything :~
2012-10-22T09:28:00.000Z	Froward	Seven_Six_Two	thanks for your help though, I'm gonna track it down in the morning when I can think straight :)
2012-10-22T09:29:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	Froward	that's no good. I think it's your kernel if you aren't getting any output
