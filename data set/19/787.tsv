2011-11-15T00:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U_bak	blueblue22	Do the two ext4 partitions you have now have any files in them currently?
2011-11-15T00:41:00.000Z	Jordan_U_bak	blueblue22	OK. Why do you have two of them?
2011-11-15T00:42:00.000Z	Jordan_U_bak	blueblue22	Why do you want a separate /home partition?
2011-11-15T00:51:00.000Z	Jordan_U_bak	blueblue22	I would highly recommend that you delete both ext4 partitions, leaving the free space available, and use the automatic partitioning option of the Ubuntu installer.
2011-11-15T00:53:00.000Z	Jordan_U_bak	blueblue22	Also delete any swap partition you may have made ahead of time. It's much easier to just let the installer create partitions as needed.
2011-11-15T00:54:00.000Z	Jordan_U_bak	blueblue22	Yes. Ubuntu's installer will create a swap partition automatically.
2011-11-15T00:58:00.000Z	Jordan_U_bak	blueblue22	What size swap the installer creates depends on what size drive you have IIRC. I would suggest that you just let it make it whatever size it wants. You can always change it later.
2011-11-15T00:59:00.000Z	Jordan_U_bak	blueblue22	Just use automatic partitioning. That will do everything needed for you.
2011-11-15T01:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U_bak	blueblue22	Yes. That sounds good.
