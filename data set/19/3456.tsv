2010-02-01T13:30:00.000Z	babbio		hi guys i have a question, i use to connect to my work pc with ssh and a password...so i have to insert the passphrase every single time....is there a way to store the passphrase somewhere so i have to insert it only the first time?
2010-02-01T13:30:00.000Z	kindofabuzz	babbio	yeah i can walk you through it
2010-02-01T13:31:00.000Z	babbio	kindofabuzz	what??
2010-02-01T13:32:00.000Z	kindofabuzz	babbio	first run ssh-keygen -t rsa
2010-02-01T13:33:00.000Z	kindofabuzz	babbio	ok, now ssh-copy-id ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub user@server:
2010-02-01T13:33:00.000Z	kindofabuzz	babbio	drop the :
2010-02-01T13:35:00.000Z	kindofabuzz	babbio	another way is just to scp or whatever the id_rsa.pub over to server:~/.ssh
2010-02-01T13:36:00.000Z	babbio	kindofabuzz	i have this error /usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: ERROR: No identities found
2010-02-01T13:36:00.000Z	kindofabuzz	babbio	are you on ubuntu?
2010-02-01T13:43:00.000Z	kindofabuzz	babbio	get it working?
2010-02-01T13:44:00.000Z	kindofabuzz	babbio	this would be the *nix way if the ubuntu way didn't work: http://www.linuxproblem.org/art_9.html
2010-02-01T13:48:00.000Z	babbio	kindofabuzz	i dont have  ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub... i only have "known_host" in my ~/.ssh
2010-02-01T13:49:00.000Z	kindofabuzz	babbio	then you didn't creat an rsa then, as user, ssh-keygen -t rsa
2010-02-01T13:49:00.000Z	babbio	kindofabuzz	i read the link just now....i'll check it out
2010-02-01T13:50:00.000Z	babbio	kindofabuzz	the rsa key was created by my boss
2010-02-01T13:50:00.000Z	kindofabuzz	babbio	once you do that you will have a ~/.ssh with two files in it. id_rsa and id_rsa.put
2010-02-01T13:50:00.000Z	kindofabuzz	babbio	ok then, point the ssh-copy-id to the right directory then
2010-02-01T13:51:00.000Z	kindofabuzz	babbio	ssh-copy-id /path/to/rsakey user@server
2010-02-01T13:54:00.000Z	babbio	kindofabuzz	same error as before :  /usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: ERROR: No identities found
