2012-06-30T23:27:00.000Z	Priyantha		I am having problems with flickerings in my screen :(
2012-06-30T23:27:00.000Z	Priyantha		This is just with transparancy shizzle
2012-06-30T23:27:00.000Z	Priyantha		It will dissapear after a while, because the transparancy is going away after a couple of seconds.
2012-06-30T23:27:00.000Z	Priyantha		And then is the background in my terminal solid again.
2012-06-30T23:27:00.000Z	Priyantha		But during fadings the screen has very anoying flickerings :(
2012-06-30T23:27:00.000Z	Priyantha		Maybe somebody know how come ? I am running the latest stable Ubuntu 12.04 with the latest Nvidia drivers from the repo.
2012-06-30T23:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Priyantha	if you log in to the Unity2D session, is it ok?
2012-06-30T23:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Priyantha	I guess so
2012-06-30T23:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Priyantha	no idea dude, its good to test with that. 2D doesn't use junky compiz :D
2012-06-30T23:49:00.000Z	Priyantha	ActionParsnip	I tried the 2D version
2012-06-30T23:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Priyantha	what make and model is the system
2012-07-01T00:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Priyantha	and what is the output of:  lsb_release -sc
2012-07-01T00:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Priyantha	seems it has that switchable GPU junk, is that right?

2012-07-01T00:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Priyantha	try the boot option: acpi_backlight=vendor
2012-07-01T00:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Priyantha	as I put it, don't change it
2012-07-01T00:18:00.000Z	Priyantha	ActionParsnip	back now booted with those options
2012-07-01T00:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Priyantha	then remove it and reboot after running: sudo update-grub   obviously to apply the new change
