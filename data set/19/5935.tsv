2008-04-17T00:37:00.000Z	Yazan`		guys, why would my two green lights(DSL modem) be on even if i'm not connected to the internet?
2008-04-17T00:39:00.000Z	genii	Yazan`	Might depend on what the labels below those lights says as to what it means when they are on
2008-04-17T00:40:00.000Z	Yazan`	genii	The lights are ON when the computer is connected to the internet. But while it's on, one flashes red.
2008-04-17T00:41:00.000Z	genii	Yazan`	That might be the light indicating network traffic is occurring
2008-04-17T00:41:00.000Z	genii	Yazan`	But if you really want to definitively know, find the user manual for your particular dsl modem
2008-04-17T00:43:00.000Z	Yazan`	genii	I have tried to connect to the internet while runnning on ubuntu, and when I try to go throught the pppconf process, it tells me that the system DO find something called eth0, but after that, it gives me an error that it wont.
2008-04-17T00:46:00.000Z	genii	Yazan`	If on windows you were using some ISP login process, that likely means you need to set up a pppoe cnnection instead of a ppp regular kind.
2008-04-17T00:47:00.000Z	Yazan`	genii	that is exactly how it's done. So, I will try this guide?: http://www.linux-usb.org/SpeedTouch/ubuntu/index.html
2008-04-17T00:47:00.000Z	genii	Yazan`	Use pppoeconf instead of pppconf
2008-04-17T00:48:00.000Z	Yazan`	genii	I did. I just didn't know how to spell it the first time :P
2008-04-17T00:48:00.000Z	genii	Yazan`	Reading the link you gave
2008-04-17T00:50:00.000Z	genii	Yazan`	So this is a usb modem and not connected to your computer by ethernet cable, but by usb cord? Or a usb modem but still connected by ethernet cord, etc etc
2008-04-17T00:50:00.000Z	Yazan`	genii	It's a DSL modem connected to my computer via a USB.
2008-04-17T00:51:00.000Z	genii	Yazan`	OK. So ignore the eth0, it is the ethernet adapter.
2008-04-17T00:51:00.000Z	Yazan`	genii	So when it tells me that it recognizes eth0, it isn't what I need, right?
2008-04-17T00:53:00.000Z	genii	Yazan`	Correct. You would need eth0 if the ethernet plug is how the modem goes to the computer
2008-04-17T00:53:00.000Z	Yazan`	genii	So, I need to do what that guide asks me to?? Or it isn't the right one?? Many people told me it is.
2008-04-17T00:54:00.000Z	genii	Yazan`	Judging by that website, that particular modem is a nightmare to set up. If your modem is the kind listed there, yes, use it as a guide.
2008-04-17T00:55:00.000Z	Yazan`	genii	Yep. Thanks.
