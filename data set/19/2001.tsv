2012-09-15T03:07:00.000Z	whoever		hi all i have a blue tint on  videos that i try to watch on youtube , and I tried Fix one and two, i don't have the option that is listed in fix 3 can someone assist http://www.wiredrevolution.com/ubuntu/fix-blue-tinted-video-in-ubuntu
2012-09-15T03:08:00.000Z	shihan	whoever	which browser (chrome?)?
2012-09-15T03:10:00.000Z	whoever	shihan	firefox , chrome and opera
2012-09-15T03:11:00.000Z	shihan	whoever	hmmm, i know with chrome what i do is install "adobe-flashplugin" package, then in chrome i go to "chrome://plugins" (you should now see two flash plugins) disable the one that has ppapi associated with it...
2012-09-15T03:13:00.000Z	whoever	shihan	and where would i find the one that has pappi associated with it
2012-09-15T03:13:00.000Z	shihan	whoever	there are also these options if your getting it in other places: http://askubuntu.com/questions/117127/flash-video-appears-blue (they all kinda involve disabling hardware accellartion in one way or another)
2012-09-15T03:13:00.000Z	shihan	whoever	in chrome://plugins (go to that in chrome) it'll probably be the first plugin, you should see two versions of it
2012-09-15T03:14:00.000Z	shihan	whoever	the askubuntu.com link is probably one of the more up to date and useful bits of info for fixing blue tint issues tho (from what i've seen before)
2012-09-15T03:16:00.000Z	shihan	whoever	try the chrome one first tho, before doing all the askubuntu ones
2012-09-15T03:16:00.000Z	shihan	whoever	also, if its only happening with flash, you might also try right-clicking on a flash video while its playing and going to "settings" and disable hardware accelation on the first tab
2012-09-15T03:18:00.000Z	shihan		my gf has an intuos 5, i'll go grab and see what it does
2012-09-15T03:19:00.000Z	whoever	shihan	to give you a heads up gotta restart for the fix you gave me to try back in a a second
2012-09-15T03:20:00.000Z	shihan		roey: yeah, actually this one does too... i didnt do anything and it just came straight up... also doesnt load the wacom module
2012-09-15T03:20:00.000Z	shihan		roey: oh, no sorry it did load wacom
2012-09-15T03:20:00.000Z	shihan		roey: yeah, though im on ubuntu not kubuntu
2012-09-15T03:20:00.000Z	shihan		roey: the little oled display things are blank tho
2012-09-15T03:21:00.000Z	shihan		roey: oh wait, sorry, this is an intuos 4, my appologies
2012-09-15T03:27:00.000Z	whoever	shihan	thx , that repo worked
2012-09-15T03:27:00.000Z	shihan	whoever	kewl :)
