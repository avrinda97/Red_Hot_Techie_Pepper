2010-02-06T04:16:00.000Z	terminhell	alexxio	do you have more than 2 primary partitons? or more than 4 logicals?
2010-02-06T04:20:00.000Z	terminhell	alexxio	gparted will show those flags
2010-02-06T04:21:00.000Z	terminhell	alexxio	do you have more than one hdd?
2010-02-06T04:22:00.000Z	terminhell	alexxio	you may need to select another device in gparted, its near the top right
2010-02-06T04:23:00.000Z	terminhell	alexxio	you could try running fdisk -l
2010-02-06T04:25:00.000Z	terminhell	alexxio	what ver of windows is installed?
2010-02-06T04:28:00.000Z	terminhell	alexxio	you may have too many partitions, only t hing i can think of
2010-02-06T04:29:00.000Z	terminhell	alexxio	what are your 2 primary paritions?
2010-02-06T04:40:00.000Z	terminhell	alexxio	you could goback into windows, and manually format one of the paritions to fat32 and see if buntu detects it
