2004-10-19T15:41:00.000Z	agraupe		either my imagination is playing tricks on me, or I didn't get to set a root password during the install
2004-10-19T15:41:00.000Z	credmp	agraupe	only sudo iirc
2004-10-19T15:41:00.000Z	agraupe	credmp	ah
2004-10-19T15:42:00.000Z	agraupe	credmp	I suppose, if desired, I could run sudo passwd to set the root password?
2004-10-19T15:42:00.000Z	credmp	agraupe	tja....
2004-10-19T15:42:00.000Z	agraupe	credmp	what does tja mean?
2004-10-19T15:43:00.000Z	credmp	agraupe	it means... tja.. you could do that... but what would be the point?
2004-10-19T15:43:00.000Z	agraupe		and I just enter my user password for the "enter root password" boxes
2004-10-19T15:43:00.000Z	credmp	agraupe	tja also means I had to much whiskey
2004-10-19T15:43:00.000Z	agraupe		ah so
2004-10-19T15:43:00.000Z	credmp	agraupe	smart kid :)
2004-10-19T15:44:00.000Z	agraupe		wouldn't it be more secure to set a root password and disallow root the ability to log in?
2004-10-19T15:44:00.000Z	credmp	agraupe	they all use gnome-su iirc... make it a graphical sudo
2004-10-19T15:44:00.000Z	agraupe		right
2004-10-19T15:44:00.000Z	credmp	agraupe	so... then you would use su to go to root to perform a task instead of doing exactly the same with sudo?
2004-10-19T15:45:00.000Z	credmp		sudo su gives you root
2004-10-19T15:45:00.000Z	credmp		too
2004-10-19T15:45:00.000Z	credmp		the actual user
2004-10-19T15:46:00.000Z	agraupe	credmp	I see... I am saying that, wouldn't it be more useful to have a separate root password because then an attacker would have to guess a login/password pair and the root password to make any changes
