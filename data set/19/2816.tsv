2010-01-17T08:25:00.000Z	blendmaster1024		are there any known workarounds for the cursed broadcom wifi chipsets?
2010-01-17T08:25:00.000Z	HTT-Bird	blendmaster1024	which broadcom do you have?
2010-01-17T08:27:00.000Z	HTT-Bird	blendmaster1024	do a 'lspci -nn | grep 14e4' and paste me the line you get back
2010-01-17T08:27:00.000Z	blendmaster1024	HTT-Bird	i don't have the system up right now. just generally, are any of the ones that the foss driver doesn't work with workaroundable?
2010-01-17T08:28:00.000Z	HTT-Bird	blendmaster1024	you can use the Broadcom provided STA driver (wl.o).  YMMSV
2010-01-17T08:28:00.000Z	blendmaster1024	HTT-Bird	seriously?
2010-01-17T08:28:00.000Z	HTT-Bird	blendmaster1024	it is a binary blob driver, and may or may not work with your card
2010-01-17T08:29:00.000Z	blendmaster1024	HTT-Bird	that would be it.
2010-01-17T08:29:00.000Z	HTT-Bird	blendmaster1024	yeah, use b43legacy
2010-01-17T08:30:00.000Z	HTT-Bird	blendmaster1024	yes, it's in the kernel
2010-01-17T08:30:00.000Z	blendmaster1024	HTT-Bird	does b43legacy come preinstalled?
2010-01-17T08:30:00.000Z	HTT-Bird	blendmaster1024	no clue
2010-01-17T08:33:00.000Z	HTT-Bird	blendmaster1024	ati on linux isn't that bad with very recent (post AMD) fglrx, or with recent radeon
2010-01-17T08:34:00.000Z	blendmaster1024	HTT-Bird	oh i see i have to deal with 100% pre-amd
2010-01-17T08:34:00.000Z	HTT-Bird	blendmaster1024	most of those pre-amd cards should be supported by r300
2010-01-17T08:34:00.000Z	blendmaster1024	HTT-Bird	yes but it's very very bad support. none of my pixel shaders cards work - the system freezes when i try
2010-01-17T08:35:00.000Z	blendmaster1024	HTT-Bird	that is unless i'm using nvidia, which i do anytime i possibly can
2010-01-17T08:35:00.000Z	HTT-Bird	blendmaster1024	heh, *is an nvidia guy*
2010-01-17T08:35:00.000Z	blendmaster1024	HTT-Bird	of course, much better than intel and ati doesn't seem to work
