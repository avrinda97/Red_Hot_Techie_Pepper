2009-12-15T05:49:00.000Z	LordHawke		Anyone here savvy with VLC Player?
2009-12-15T05:49:00.000Z	spiffman	LordHawke	I use it plenty... what do you want to do?
2009-12-15T05:51:00.000Z	LordHawke	spiffman	I'm just goin' off the top of my head, here. I thought it would be interesting if I could broadcast a video stream so that people with the address/URL/etc. would be able to watch with an internet streaming player. I've looked and see that it's possible on a network, but is what I'm wanting possible? Over the internet? Without paying money for website crap?
2009-12-15T05:52:00.000Z	LordHawke	spiffman	I'd like to play it from my desktop computer so that people over the internet will be able to watch it.
2009-12-15T05:52:00.000Z	spiffman	LordHawke	on an internal network, no problem (haven't done it but it's possible). on the internet, you can try using a dynamic dns service, which is free, and you can connect from anywhere.
2009-12-15T05:53:00.000Z	LordHawke	spiffman	How would I go about such a thing. I don't know what a Dynamic Domain Name Server Service is. . .
2009-12-15T05:54:00.000Z	spiffman	LordHawke	so you'd have to first test it on an internal network. look up how to stream video on ubuntu. Then, to do it over the internet, you're going to have to get a free dynamic dns acccount (like dyndns.org or similar), and you should be able to connect to your streaming server the same way you did internally, but with the ddynamic dns address
2009-12-15T05:56:00.000Z	spiffman	LordHawke	...?
2009-12-15T05:56:00.000Z	spiffman	LordHawke	looks like the solution is not through vlc though http://freakingtips.com/2009/07/23/online-video-streaming-on-ubuntu/
2009-12-15T05:56:00.000Z	LordHawke	spiffman	Sorry. No matter what I'm doin', I tend to be a tad excessive on the elipses. . .
2009-12-15T05:58:00.000Z	spiffman	LordHawke	we know, we're joking
2009-12-15T05:59:00.000Z	LordHawke	spiffman	The package mentioned on the instruction page cannot be found. . .
2009-12-15T05:59:00.000Z	spiffman	LordHawke	ffmpeg or ffserver
2009-12-15T05:59:00.000Z	LordHawke	spiffman	FFServer
2009-12-15T06:00:00.000Z	spiffman	LordHawke	i just looked for it and didn't find it either... that tutorial was for 9.04 though and im on 9.10, i guess you'll have to find another
2009-12-15T06:01:00.000Z	spiffman	LordHawke	i looked online, there are various different methods to stream video
2009-12-15T06:03:00.000Z	spiffman	LordHawke	but to access your computer from the internet for anything, you're going to have to either set your ip to static (so you can always connect to that same address) or use dynamic dns (dyndns.org, there are a lot of tutorials on howtoforge also)
