2005-12-19T17:00:00.000Z	zdennis		yes erUSUL ?
2005-12-19T17:01:00.000Z	zdennis		ok...here's my issue. Say I have Firefox open and 8,000 pages open, and firefox is usijng 500Mb of RAM, 300MB is VIRT
2005-12-19T17:01:00.000Z	zdennis		I have another application open using 500Mb of memory, and say i Only have 512Mb of memory
2005-12-19T17:02:00.000Z	zdennis		so part of program B is in swap. I close firefox, and I'd like program B to be moved out of swap
2005-12-19T17:02:00.000Z	czr	zdennis	how did you measure the memory use?
2005-12-19T17:03:00.000Z	czr	zdennis	VIRT != memory usage
2005-12-19T17:03:00.000Z	zdennis	czr	i am running top
2005-12-19T17:04:00.000Z	zdennis	czr	swap space used "234916k"     ....   total Mem free: "201960k"
2005-12-19T17:04:00.000Z	zdennis	czr	it just bugs me that stuff stays in swap when i have open memory for it
2005-12-19T17:05:00.000Z	czr	zdennis	stuff is paged back into physical memory when it's used. free physical memory will be used for block caches, so it makes linux faster. if this bugs you you can change the swappiness factor in the kernel
2005-12-19T17:05:00.000Z	czr	zdennis	it isn't using the pages that are in swap
2005-12-19T17:05:00.000Z	czr	zdennis	as long as it doesn't use them, the pages won't swap. linux doesn't swap whole processes at a time, but pages at a time (4 or 8 KiB)
2005-12-19T17:06:00.000Z	zdennis	czr	ah
2005-12-19T17:10:00.000Z	czr	zdennis	have fun :-) and remember that VIRT != memory usage
2005-12-19T17:10:00.000Z	zdennis	czr	i have that imprinted in my braind now forever =)
2005-12-19T17:11:00.000Z	czr	zdennis	good, it will get you far in life :-)
2005-12-19T17:12:00.000Z	czr	zdennis	the closest metric you should use is RSS(/RES) which tells how much of virtual memory is present in physical memory at the moment
2005-12-19T17:13:00.000Z	czr	zdennis	so RSS should increase when a process gets some of its pages back from swap
2005-12-19T17:13:00.000Z	czr	zdennis	and RSS will decrease normally when pages are swapped to disk
