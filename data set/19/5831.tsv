2008-04-30T06:52:00.000Z	nowimproved		not the live disc LunaFreeState the alternaive
2008-04-30T06:52:00.000Z	nowimproved		well wtf Dr_willis why does it ask for a media change then? wtf
2008-04-30T06:53:00.000Z	LunaFreeState	nowimproved	look at /etc/fstab use sudo /etc/fstab
2008-04-30T06:53:00.000Z	nowimproved		lmao this is bull
2008-04-30T06:55:00.000Z	nowimproved		hey LunaFreeState what should i look for in fstab , it has no cdrom in it , remember i am on the installer disc so ...   i just need to know where the cdrom is in /dev , anyone know anything at all in here?
2008-04-30T06:56:00.000Z	LunaFreeState	nowimproved	wait a minute you want to eject the live cd while using it?
2008-04-30T06:57:00.000Z	nowimproved	LunaFreeState	that is the plan , seeing how it is asking for a media change?
2008-04-30T06:58:00.000Z	nowimproved		so hopefully if i eject it and put it back in it will fix it i dont know LunaFreeState i have never seen anything like this
2008-04-30T06:59:00.000Z	LunaFreeState	nowimproved	 that does sound strange, i installed from a flash drive, maybe that is an option for you?
2008-04-30T06:59:00.000Z	nowimproved		nope no option for me , my computer cant boot of a flash drive
2008-04-30T07:00:00.000Z	LunaFreeState	nowimproved	 you checked the bios settings?
2008-04-30T07:00:00.000Z	LunaFreeState	nowimproved	 I had to change mine to do it
2008-04-30T07:01:00.000Z	nowimproved	LunaFreeState	number one i am sure that i cant install of a flash drive , number 2 i dont have one handy, number 3 this is ridiculous, i should be able to install from a cd , number 4 this is like the 5th time i have attempted to install this bs and i am sick of it
2008-04-30T07:02:00.000Z	LunaFreeState	nowimproved	 try reburning the cd or another cd drive if one is handy, another distro if not
