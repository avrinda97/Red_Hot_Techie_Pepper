2010-02-12T09:18:00.000Z	Automatrix		Gentlemen, got a problem, my provider changed firmware of my modem/router, but without willing to give me the new administrator pw ...
2010-02-12T09:19:00.000Z	Automatrix		is there a way to intercept their pw at coldboot of the modem ?
2010-02-12T09:19:00.000Z	Out_Cold	Automatrix	any router/modem should have a reset.. but wrong place to ask
2010-02-12T09:20:00.000Z	Automatrix	Out_Cold	firmaware has been changed and pw is hardcoded inside
2010-02-12T09:20:00.000Z	Automatrix	Out_Cold	wher should I ask my questionn ?
2010-02-12T09:21:00.000Z	Out_Cold	Automatrix	what brand is the router/isp?

2010-02-12T09:23:00.000Z	Automatrix		thanks  Out_Cold
2010-02-12T09:26:00.000Z	Automatrix	Out_Cold	I did that but PW seems to be hardcoded in the firmware, so no access
2010-02-12T09:27:00.000Z	Out_Cold	Automatrix	i live in canada but i have never seen a router that can not be reset to default..
2010-02-12T09:27:00.000Z	Automatrix	Out_Cold	I've got one ;) so does several thousand people here
2010-02-12T09:29:00.000Z	Out_Cold	Automatrix	well if many people there have them, try looking for a forum or something similar for the ISP.
2010-02-12T09:30:00.000Z	Automatrix		the same problem fore everyone, nobody s' got the administrator password
2010-02-12T09:30:00.000Z	Out_Cold	Automatrix	it's near certain someone else has had/fixed that before.
2010-02-12T09:30:00.000Z	Out_Cold	Automatrix	i would refuse service if i could not control my own equipment
2010-02-12T09:30:00.000Z	Automatrix	Out_Cold	too late now, the did it
