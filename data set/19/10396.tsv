2007-08-30T11:18:00.000Z	brian__		 so when I enable my desktop effects .. everything works except the cube.. my desktop numbers go down to 1
2007-08-30T11:18:00.000Z	brian__		what do you mean lost gnine
2007-08-30T11:19:00.000Z	brian__		no one is in there
2007-08-30T11:19:00.000Z	brian__		ha, alright
2007-08-30T11:20:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	brian__	That is still non-supported effects... Mine did that as well.. but I turned it all off then back on and it is fixed..for awhile..
2007-11-20T09:15:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	brian__	just for grins.. reduce/change your screen res or try the vesa driver
2007-11-20T09:35:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	brian__	I have never seen a monitor that only supported a single res.
2007-11-20T09:37:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	brian__	Just pointing out that it DOES support more than one res.
2007-11-20T09:39:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	brian__	I have seen many people fight their video driver to find they didnt get their monitor setup correctly in the xorg
2007-11-20T09:40:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	brian__	good luck, lots of help here. but try to avoid blanket statements..
2007-11-20T09:41:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	brian__	But it would tell you a lot about where to go to fix the problem
2007-11-20T09:53:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	brian__	cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf ~/Desktop/xorg.conf.$(date +%m-%d-%Y-%T)            is how I do it
2007-12-26T07:11:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	brian__	If you are trying to get data back from a raid array....   built with windows...  ugh..
2007-12-26T07:12:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	brian__	I have not had any luck with doing it
2007-12-26T07:13:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	brian__	Which is one reason I avoid raid these days, not to mention the drives are so much faster than when I needed raid to get systems up to speed
2007-12-26T07:14:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	brian__	I have been there...   and no I dont have any solutions
2008-03-30T19:13:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	brian__	that line has gotten very fuzzy, I run a ton of kde apps in ubuntu/gnome
2008-03-30T19:14:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	brian__	type three or so letters and hit tab
2008-03-30T19:15:00.000Z	brian__	Jack_Sparrow	OK thanks a lot
