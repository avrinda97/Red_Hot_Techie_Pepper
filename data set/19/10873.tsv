2007-08-23T09:41:00.000Z	MrMist		Hey guys
2007-08-23T09:41:00.000Z	MrMist		I'm having big problems installing the server version of Feisty. The installation stops at 85%
2007-08-23T09:41:00.000Z	MrMist		Any ideas why ?
2007-08-23T09:42:00.000Z	sipior	MrMist	any hint of what it was doing at that point?
2007-08-23T09:42:00.000Z	MrMist	sipior	It says: installed php5-mysql
2007-08-23T09:43:00.000Z	sipior	MrMist	is there a "details" tab you can open up on screen?
2007-08-23T09:45:00.000Z	MrMist	sipior	Ah... luckily the setup program dumps messages to another terminal
2007-08-23T09:45:00.000Z	MrMist	sipior	Seems the installation program tries to resulv norwegian servers, however they seem down
2007-08-23T09:46:00.000Z	sipior	MrMist	yes, a large part of Surfnet is down atm, that may be your trouble
2007-08-23T09:46:00.000Z	MrMist	sipior	Any way I can get the setup program to use other servers?
2007-08-23T09:47:00.000Z	sipior	MrMist	you might try selecting a different location at the beginning, as i assume they choose servers based upon that information. play around, see what you can find.
2007-08-23T09:47:00.000Z	MrMist	sipior	I get an error from security.ubuntu.com
2007-08-23T09:48:00.000Z	sipior	MrMist	might want to wait a bit, till the network craziness dies down
2007-08-23T09:48:00.000Z	MrMist	sipior	Ehm... I've allready formatted the drive
2007-08-23T09:49:00.000Z	sipior	MrMist	don't worry, it'll stay formatted :)
2007-08-23T09:49:00.000Z	MrMist	sipior	ehm... but I want to use the PC
2007-08-23T09:49:00.000Z	MrMist		argh
2007-08-23T09:50:00.000Z	sipior	MrMist	well, you can boot from the live CD, or just try selecting another server set
2007-08-23T09:59:00.000Z	MrMist	sipior	I'm trying to connect to a swedish server now
