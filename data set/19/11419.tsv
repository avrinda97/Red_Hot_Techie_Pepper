2006-01-25T13:15:00.000Z	steve_		hey - wondered how 2 enable ssh connections in ubuntu...  looks like nowhere in gnome 2 do...
2006-01-25T13:16:00.000Z	steve_		allow for connections to it.
2006-01-25T13:16:00.000Z	nanotube	steve_	you want to connect to the outside, or to allow others to connect to your machine?
2006-01-25T13:16:00.000Z	nanotube	steve_	install the openssh package
2006-01-25T13:17:00.000Z	nanotube	steve_	have fun :)
2006-01-25T13:18:00.000Z	nanotube	steve_	ah cool. well apt-getting the openssh is the easiest way. that will automatically set up ssh for you... and as long as you choose good passwords, its secure
2006-01-25T13:19:00.000Z	steve_	nanotube	- i love apt-getting. :)  i go get it now. :)
2006-01-25T13:20:00.000Z	nanotube	steve_	you go! :)
2006-01-25T13:25:00.000Z	nanotube	steve_	hehe, if one of the f keys is fubar, just use one of the other 12 :)
2006-01-25T13:25:00.000Z	steve_	nanotube	maybe i want 2 run something in every term eh?
2006-01-25T13:26:00.000Z	nanotube	steve_	heh well, if you are that hard core, then sure :D
2006-01-25T13:26:00.000Z	steve_	nanotube	- hahah well, i've got limited power --- running this on a PII believe it or no
2006-01-25T13:28:00.000Z	nanotube	steve_	sure, but what if all your f keys except for f7 are fubar - how do you switch to a non-gui console? :)
2006-01-25T13:28:00.000Z	steve_	nanotube	- boot disk?
2006-01-25T13:29:00.000Z	nanotube	steve_	: hehe
2006-01-25T13:35:00.000Z	nanotube	steve_	im using xchat too, cuz it came with ubuntu by default...
2006-01-25T13:43:00.000Z	nanotube	steve_	ah heh ic. well, have fun getting some sleep. im a grad student, got evening classes, so can afford some late night :)
