2006-10-19T16:50:00.000Z	fresch		when i start compiz, the window decorations dissappear and the windows contents are unresponsive. nvidia driver installed and working. any clues?
2006-10-19T16:51:00.000Z	mnepton	fresch	you might want to read the /topic before continuing
2006-10-19T16:51:00.000Z	fresch	mnepton	so how does a security bug in nvidia relate to my question!?
2006-10-19T16:52:00.000Z	mnepton	fresch	it relates to yuor question because you're using the nVidia driver, and there is a remote root exploit for it.
2006-10-19T16:52:00.000Z	mnepton	fresch	which translates to "you probably do not want to use the nVidia driver"
2006-10-19T16:53:00.000Z	fresch	mnepton	i FAIL to see how this security root exploit relates to "compiz not working right"
2006-10-19T16:54:00.000Z	mnepton	fresch	"nVidia driver installed and working" (your words) is translated by anyone caring about system security to "my machine is open to a remote buffer overflow exploit." which is not good.
2006-10-19T16:55:00.000Z	fresch	mnepton	are you suggestiong i should go and buy a ati card!? all i want is to run compiz. and my xserver isnt accepting ANY tcp connections, so there should NOT be a problem
2006-10-19T16:56:00.000Z	mnepton	fresch	i'm suggesting, as the /topic says, that you start by switching from the "nvidia" driver to the "nv" driver, and *then* worrying about compiz
2006-10-19T16:56:00.000Z	mnepton	fresch	and the X server does not have to accept remote connections
2006-10-19T16:57:00.000Z	fresch	mnepton	sure, then i wont be able to run compiz, since the nv driver does not do hw accel
2006-10-19T16:57:00.000Z	mnepton	fresch	which is why i said "you might want to look at the /topic first"
2006-10-19T05:02:00.000Z	fresch	mnepton	yeah, ok, nice... so i'll be careful watching images on the web, heck, i wont even SURF the web while having the nvidia driver loaded (which i will continue to do, since I REALLY WANT HW ACCEL). so there. now, how about my compiz problem?
2006-10-19T05:02:00.000Z	mnepton	fresch	it's any font. in anything. a web page. a text document. anything.
2006-10-19T05:03:00.000Z	fresch	mnepton	so you are saying my problem could be that compiz is asking to render a crazy image?
2006-10-19T05:04:00.000Z	mnepton	fresch	i'm saying that preferring hardware acceleration and eye candy to system security and stability is a really, really poor choice, IMO.
2006-10-19T05:04:00.000Z	fresch	mnepton	its just my almost always offline desktop machine at home.
2006-10-19T05:05:00.000Z	fresch	mnepton	and i never had any problems with nvidia drivers
2006-10-19T05:05:00.000Z	mnepton	fresch	cosidering the bug was indetified outside nVidia 4 days ago, that doesn;t surprise me
