2009-01-09T11:16:00.000Z	giacomo_c		oh no, i tried to take a screenshot, but it only took a screenshot of my screen inside of my bigger screen...
2009-01-09T11:16:00.000Z	giacomo_c		how can i undo proposed updates?
2009-01-09T11:17:00.000Z	giacomo_c		i checked the proposed updates, then did an update and now it's messed up my display
2009-01-09T11:17:00.000Z	giacomo_c		it doesn't seem to have the right resolution for the screen, though it's showing me the full screen, but the wallpaper is only in a smaller portion with the outside just living marks from the windows
2009-01-09T11:19:00.000Z	giacomo_c		does anyone know how to remove proposed updates?
2009-01-09T11:20:00.000Z	giacomo_c		yeah, i disabled it
2009-01-09T11:21:00.000Z	giacomo_c		i disabled proposed updates, now i just want to know how to undo the updates it made
2009-01-09T11:22:00.000Z	giacomo_c		is there a way to see what updates happened when?
2009-01-09T11:22:00.000Z	giacomo_c		where are those?
2009-01-09T11:23:00.000Z	giacomo_c		and i think it update the kernel too
2009-01-09T11:24:00.000Z	therealnanotube	giacomo_c	dpkg logs are in /var/log/dpkg.log
2009-01-09T11:38:00.000Z	therealnanotube	giacomo_c	make a shortcut to the trash folder...
2009-01-09T11:39:00.000Z	giacomo_c	therealnanotube	how do i do that?  could i make a launcher that was like nautilus trash:///
2009-01-09T11:40:00.000Z	therealnanotube	giacomo_c	hm, don't know, try it. :) the actual trash folder is in ~/.local/share/Trash/
2009-01-09T11:41:00.000Z	therealnanotube	giacomo_c	but i suppose if you make a launcher to "nautilus trash:///", it should work too
2009-01-09T11:41:00.000Z	therealnanotube	giacomo_c	but it's probably easiest to just stick a trash icon on the panel... (right click panel, add to panel, trash)
2009-01-09T11:41:00.000Z	giacomo_c	therealnanotube	no, that did it
2009-01-09T11:42:00.000Z	therealnanotube	giacomo_c	nice :)
2009-01-09T11:43:00.000Z	therealnanotube	giacomo_c	good luck... :)
