2006-10-30T17:05:00.000Z	dave		hey I need to remove a package from the repository the problem is its already removed and when I try to add a different package it gets stuck on the one it cannot remove?
2006-10-30T17:06:00.000Z	dave		<wweasel> sounds like we are in the same boat
2006-10-30T17:07:00.000Z	dave		yeah with brscan2
2006-10-30T17:07:00.000Z	dave		lol I cant remove it and I cant leave it
2006-10-30T17:07:00.000Z	cge	dave	Which package?
2006-10-30T17:08:00.000Z	cge	dave	No
2006-10-30T17:09:00.000Z	cge	dave	paste in #flood now
2006-10-30T17:11:00.000Z	cge	dave	What you could try is to make those directories.
2006-10-30T17:12:00.000Z	cge	dave	That might work. You can use apt-get install --reinstall
2006-10-30T17:13:00.000Z	cge	dave	Then you can try creating those directories with mkdir.
2006-10-30T17:13:00.000Z	cge	dave	If you blank that script, then apt will think it uninstalled correctly.
2006-10-30T17:14:00.000Z	cge	dave	For you it should be /var/lib/dpkg/info/brscan2.prerm
2006-10-30T17:14:00.000Z	cge	dave	Just change it to "#!/bin/sh", and that should work.
2006-10-30T17:15:00.000Z	cge	dave	Hmm...
2006-10-30T17:16:00.000Z	cge	dave	I must have the wrong location for the script.
2006-10-30T17:16:00.000Z	cge	dave	You are still getting the same error message, or has the error changed?
2006-10-30T17:17:00.000Z	cge	dave	Hmm...
2006-10-30T17:17:00.000Z	cge	dave	Could you post the removal error message in #flood?
2006-10-30T17:20:00.000Z	cge	dave	Oh! You're having a problem with the postrm script. So you need to blank the /var/lib/dpkg/info/brscan2.postrm
