2011-05-01T13:25:00.000Z	Ubuntu_user		So what could be the problem that natty does not launch my sh programs
2011-05-01T13:26:00.000Z	genii-around	Ubuntu_user	Are you making your sh programs +x ?
2011-05-01T13:26:00.000Z	Ubuntu_user	genii-around	 yes
2011-05-01T13:27:00.000Z	genii-around	Ubuntu_user	Do they have the #!/bin/bash     shebang as first line?
2011-05-01T13:27:00.000Z	genii-around	Ubuntu_user	( or /bin/sh or other shell as you like )
2011-05-01T13:28:00.000Z	Ubuntu_user	genii-around	 i have not made that program, its netbeans 7.0 and jdk 6
2011-05-01T13:29:00.000Z	genii-around	Ubuntu_user	If it is java, and not shell script, are you running the program as like:/usr/bin/java ./local-java-appname
2011-05-01T13:29:00.000Z	Ubuntu_user	genii-around	 I just downloaded netbeans 7.0 from web and executed it, no wizrd comes up ever
2011-05-01T13:30:00.000Z	Ubuntu_user	genii-around	 no sh ./path
2011-05-01T13:31:00.000Z	genii-around	Ubuntu_user	So, you downloaded some source file for netbeans? Why not instead: sudo apt-cache update &&  sudo apt-get install netbeans                            ?
2011-05-01T13:32:00.000Z	genii-around	Ubuntu_user	the first command there should be sudo apt-get update and not apt-cache, apologies
2011-05-01T13:32:00.000Z	Ubuntu_user	genii-around	 because sudo does not have 7.0 it is for 6.9 only
2011-05-01T13:33:00.000Z	Ubuntu_user	genii-around	 thats why i downloaded it and tried to execute, but it works well on 10.10 but not on 11.04
2011-05-01T13:37:00.000Z	Ubuntu_user	genii-around	 are you there?
2011-05-01T13:37:00.000Z	genii-around	Ubuntu_user	Mostly. Is 4:30 or so AM
2011-05-01T13:38:00.000Z	Ubuntu_user	genii-around	 ahh. its 2:00 pm here
2011-05-01T13:38:00.000Z	genii-around	Ubuntu_user	Anyhow, perhaps to: sudo chmod +x <netbeans-filename.sh>
2011-05-01T13:39:00.000Z	Ubuntu_user	genii-around	 okay i try that too
2011-05-01T13:40:00.000Z	genii-around	Ubuntu_user	Then to: sudo /bin/sh ./<netbeans-filename.sh>     when you are in the directory that file sits
