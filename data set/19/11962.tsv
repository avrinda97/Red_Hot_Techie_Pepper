2005-10-29T08:11:00.000Z	jenda		I'd like to know this too: anyone know how to globally change permissions on a folder and al subsequent folders and files under that folder?
2005-10-29T08:12:00.000Z	Stormx2	jenda	Yes. Recursive chmod, but i forget.
2005-10-29T08:15:00.000Z	jenda	Stormx2	thanks. Good enough I'll figure out the rest
2005-11-04T12:55:00.000Z	jenda	Stormx2	drake
2005-11-25T10:45:00.000Z	Stormx2	jenda	Check the wiki
2005-11-25T10:47:00.000Z	jenda	Stormx2	that didn't work :)
2005-11-25T10:47:00.000Z	Stormx2	jenda	It did, it just pmed me it.
2005-11-25T10:47:00.000Z	jenda	Stormx2	ah cool
2005-11-25T10:59:00.000Z	Stormx2	jenda	not really...
2005-11-25T10:59:00.000Z	jenda	Stormx2	thought so
2005-11-25T10:59:00.000Z	Stormx2	jenda	You can use Serpentine for audio or GNOMEBaker for anything else
2005-11-25T11:00:00.000Z	jenda	Stormx2	that's exactly what I do. Sometimes Gbaker is better even for audio
2005-11-25T11:00:00.000Z	Stormx2	jenda	Or there is the command-line tool called cdrecord
2005-11-25T11:01:00.000Z	Stormx2	jenda	I find that.
2005-11-25T11:01:00.000Z	jenda	Stormx2	never tried that. I was just curious if Nero is worth breaking my no-non-free-soft rule...
2005-11-25T11:01:00.000Z	Stormx2	jenda	Hell, if you have mp3 decoders, you are breaking the non-free software rule ;-)
2005-11-25T11:02:00.000Z	jenda	Stormx2	I know... I try to use ogg whenever I can.
2006-03-07T17:01:00.000Z	Stormx2	jenda	wuzza? :P
2006-03-07T17:02:00.000Z	jenda	Stormx2	Ya, wuzza :)
