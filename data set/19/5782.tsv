2011-06-27T05:04:00.000Z	TeamColtra		Okay so I found http://askubuntu.com/questions/40683/how-do-i-share-my-connection-with-ics-and-an-xbox-360 to help me share my internet connection with my xbox (and I tried it with another device too still no dice) -- They get IP addresses assigned to them and all is good but they cannot actually connect to the internet
2011-06-27T05:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TeamColtra	can they ping 8.8.8.8 ?
2011-06-27T05:05:00.000Z	TeamColtra	ActionParsnip	:P unfortunately one is my docked tablet and the other is my xbox neither of which have "ping" capibilities
2011-06-27T05:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TeamColtra	makes sense, xbox sucks for anything intelligent
2011-06-27T05:06:00.000Z	TeamColtra	ActionParsnip	thats why its built by Microsoft ;)
2011-06-27T05:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TeamColtra	try amnually setting the DNS servers to 8.8.8.8  and 8.8.4.4
2011-06-27T05:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TeamColtra	Windows is built by the same and has ping capabilities, your xbox is just an even more crippled windows system
2011-06-27T05:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TeamColtra	you may not be broadcasting DNS settings so you may need to manually set it
2011-06-27T05:09:00.000Z	TeamColtra	ActionParsnip	8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 did not fix it
2011-06-27T05:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TeamColtra	can you web browse to your routers IP address (assuming you have one)
2011-06-27T05:11:00.000Z	TeamColtra	ActionParsnip	can you rephrase that into dummy terms? :P (or if that was dummy terms -- 5 year old terms :P )
2012-11-23T06:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TeamColtra	what video chip do you use?
2012-11-23T06:17:00.000Z	TeamColtra	ActionParsnip	Radion somethinger-other. How do I check the exact card? lspci or something?
2012-11-23T06:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TeamColtra	lspci | grep -i vga
2012-11-23T06:19:00.000Z	TeamColtra	ActionParsnip	lspci | grep -i vga returns nothing (moves down to the next line in terminal)
2012-11-23T06:20:00.000Z	TeamColtra	ActionParsnip	but I just ran lspci and found it
2012-11-23T06:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TeamColtra	and what is the output of:  lsb_release -sc
2012-11-23T06:22:00.000Z	TeamColtra	ActionParsnip	Quantal
2012-11-23T06:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TeamColtra	The Xorg in Quantal hates Ati 2xxx 3xxx and 4xxx GPUs. This PPA will help: http://www.ubuntuvibes.com/2012/10/how-to-install-amd-catalyst-legacy.html
