2010-07-16T09:56:00.000Z	Purpley		hi guys,What is the 3 digit number with chmod to make a .bin file executeable? For example sudo chmod xxx file.bin
2010-07-16T09:56:00.000Z	violinappren	Purpley	chmod u+x
2010-07-16T09:57:00.000Z	Purpley	violinappren	Thanks I always have trouble with chmod :)
2010-07-16T10:03:00.000Z	violinappren	Purpley	downloaded to a temporary file and sent back when saved
2010-07-16T10:03:00.000Z	Purpley	violinappren	Ahh what about if opened with vi?
2010-07-16T10:04:00.000Z	violinappren	Purpley	are you opening is inside an ssh session in a terminal or using Places > Connect To?
2010-07-16T10:04:00.000Z	Purpley	violinappren	inside a ssh session
2010-07-16T10:05:00.000Z	violinappren	Purpley	then no, it's not downloaded, the ssh binary transmits everything you see on a terminal back and forth, as if it's local terminal
2010-07-16T10:05:00.000Z	Purpley	violinappren	Ahh thats what I thought
2010-07-16T10:07:00.000Z	violinappren	Purpley	use nano, it's much more friendlier than VI
2010-07-16T10:36:00.000Z	violinappren	Purpley	use ssh -C (for compressing data back and forth)
2010-07-16T10:36:00.000Z	Purpley	violinappren	Im using putty but im sure theres a noption for that, thanks
2010-07-16T11:33:00.000Z	violinappren	Purpley	do you mean the upload speed for the whole server? try ntop
2010-07-16T11:34:00.000Z	Purpley	violinappren	Does that require a gui?
2010-07-16T11:34:00.000Z	violinappren	Purpley	no, runs in terminal like top
2010-07-16T11:36:00.000Z	Purpley	violinappren	? I dont see anything simple looks like its doing something with a bunch of protocols I just need to test port 80
2010-07-17T03:17:00.000Z	violinappren	Purpley	sprinkle fairy dust on the files
2010-07-17T03:33:00.000Z	violinappren	Purpley	tar -xvf
2010-07-17T03:33:00.000Z	Purpley	violinappren	Ahh thanks
