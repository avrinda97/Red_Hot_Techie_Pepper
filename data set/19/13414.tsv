2005-04-13T12:32:00.000Z	osity	kain	where do i type test parm?
2005-04-13T12:32:00.000Z	kain	osity	you must type in a terminal
2005-04-13T12:33:00.000Z	osity	kain	,,.ya i typed it and nothing happened ,.,,,what does that mean
2005-04-13T12:33:00.000Z	kain	osity	testparm is an utility to check if smb.conf is right
2005-04-13T12:33:00.000Z	osity	kain	,,.ya i typed it and nothing happened
2005-04-13T12:33:00.000Z	kain	osity	maybe you must run it with sudo
2005-04-13T12:33:00.000Z	kain	osity	try sudo testparm
2005-04-13T12:35:00.000Z	kain	osity	no, it can be run from any dir
2005-04-13T12:35:00.000Z	kain	osity	no, I try it from putty right now
2005-04-13T12:39:00.000Z	kain	osity	are you sure you have /etc/samba/smb.conf ? maybe you must rename it because is smb.conf.sample or .new?
2005-04-13T12:44:00.000Z	osity	kain	 i renamed the original smb.conf to smb(orig).conf and created a new one
2005-04-13T12:45:00.000Z	kain	osity	mm.. no, unleass you edit it right
2005-04-13T12:45:00.000Z	kain	osity	check permissions
2005-04-13T12:45:00.000Z	kain	osity	ls -lh and see what permissions original smb.conf has
2005-04-13T12:46:00.000Z	osity	kain	: looking now
2005-04-13T12:47:00.000Z	osity	kain	: permissions are the same
2005-04-13T12:47:00.000Z	kain	osity	try using the default smb.conf and see if the service starts
