2009-03-23T14:17:00.000Z	KoolD		hey all...just wanted to know something.....are the settings in /proc/acpi/themal_zone/THM/ the same in all ubuntu systems or are they specific to the computer being used?
2009-03-23T14:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	KoolD	looks fairly standard, the data in the files will be different though, i guess

2009-03-23T14:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	KoolD	i think its hooking into lm_sensors, i have files in the THRM folder
2009-09-08T17:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	KoolD	do you mean and instead of or?
2009-09-08T17:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	KoolD	that will give evryone LITERALLY, full access to the file
2009-09-08T17:41:00.000Z	KoolD	ActionParsnip	no i meant or like if i want to enable all user to just write to a file
2009-09-08T17:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	KoolD	then add put the users that you want access in a group, then give that group ownership to the file
2009-09-08T17:44:00.000Z	KoolD	ActionParsnip	i dont want to limit the users to a list.isnt there a way to allow any user to write to it?
2009-09-08T17:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	KoolD	you can give group ownership to the group 'users'
2009-09-08T17:45:00.000Z	KoolD	ActionParsnip	how do i do that through the console...I know how to do it via gui but i want to change the ownership of multiple files
2009-09-08T17:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	KoolD	sudo chown :users <folder>
2009-09-08T17:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	KoolD	you can then run: sudo chown g+w <folder>
2009-09-08T17:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	KoolD	to keep others out you can use: sudo chown root <folder>
2009-09-08T17:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	KoolD	so its now roots but you are letting the group of users have access to the folder
2009-09-15T16:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	KoolD	if you have it attatched and run: sudo lshw -C network     you can see what chip it uses and wesearch from that
2009-09-15T16:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	KoolD	if nothing comes up, use     lsusb   you can then search for the 8 character hex code
2009-09-15T16:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	KoolD	nice :)
2009-10-16T17:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	KoolD	sudo kill -9     it
