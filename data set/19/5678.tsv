2008-05-18T05:17:00.000Z	CoolAcid		Is there docs on the differences between -server and -generic kernels somewhere? Server runs fine on -generic but panics on -server or -xen
2008-05-18T05:17:00.000Z	crimsun	CoolAcid	which versions of -generic, -server, and -xen?
2008-05-18T05:17:00.000Z	CoolAcid		hardy
2008-05-18T05:17:00.000Z	CoolAcid		2.6.24-16
2008-05-18T05:17:00.000Z	crimsun	CoolAcid	ideally, you would be able to reproduce this problem using -17-server and -17-xen from hardy-proposed
2008-05-18T05:18:00.000Z	CoolAcid		herm - ok didn't see those in proposed new?
2008-05-18T05:18:00.000Z	CoolAcid		Oh - I know why - I was looking in backports not proposed..
2008-05-18T05:19:00.000Z	CoolAcid	crimsun	docs to add proposed?
2008-05-18T05:21:00.000Z	crimsun	CoolAcid	System> Administration> Software Sources> Updates> Pre-release updates
2008-05-18T05:21:00.000Z	CoolAcid		it's server no gui ;)
2008-05-18T05:21:00.000Z	CoolAcid		but I think I found it
2008-05-18T05:21:00.000Z	crimsun	CoolAcid	edit /etc/apt/sources.list, uncomment the hardy-proposed line for main restricted, update
2008-05-18T05:22:00.000Z	CoolAcid	crimsun	not in the .list found a bug report with edgy so I'll add that and change it to hardy
2008-05-18T05:23:00.000Z	crimsun	CoolAcid	hardy-proposed.  Please note that.
2008-05-18T05:23:00.000Z	CoolAcid		yep - got that.
2008-05-18T05:25:00.000Z	CoolAcid	crimsun	did you want me to report back to you?
2008-05-18T05:25:00.000Z	crimsun	CoolAcid	only if there's a life-threatening issue
2008-05-18T05:26:00.000Z	crimsun	CoolAcid	and in that case, you're better off contacting your local emergency contact  :)
2008-05-18T05:26:00.000Z	CoolAcid	crimsun	Your no fun :) Thanks for the details on the updated kernel.
