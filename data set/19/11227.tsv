2006-03-24T16:32:00.000Z	sethk	Daskies	it's possible, but more likely you just messed up the menus
2006-03-24T16:32:00.000Z	sethk	Daskies	try running it from the command line
2006-03-24T16:32:00.000Z	Daskies	sethk	The command to do so is?
2006-03-24T16:33:00.000Z	sethk	Daskies	I use synaptic, which is one of a couple of programs that do it.  Try sudo synaptic
2006-03-24T16:33:00.000Z	Daskies	sethk	I can acess synaptic just fine
2006-03-24T16:34:00.000Z	sethk	Daskies	I don't remember the command line version of the simpler installer.  But, if in fact you uninstalled the other one, you can reinstall it with synaptic
2006-03-24T16:35:00.000Z	Daskies	sethk	gnomefreak: I did indeed unistall it
2006-03-24T16:36:00.000Z	sethk	Daskies	ok, now we know.  :)
2006-03-24T16:38:00.000Z	Daskies	sethk	gnomefreak: The package is gnome-app-install FYI
2006-04-29T11:39:00.000Z	sethk	Daskies	for future reference, try  "apropos copy"
2006-04-29T11:42:00.000Z	sethk	Daskies	because you didn't use -r
2006-04-29T11:42:00.000Z	sethk	Daskies	it doesn't copy directories by default, only files
2006-04-29T11:42:00.000Z	Daskies	sethk	so cp -r [file]  [destination] 
2006-04-29T11:42:00.000Z	sethk	Daskies	so it is telling you that your copy list included this name, but the name was not used
2006-04-29T11:42:00.000Z	sethk	Daskies	yes, if that is what you want
2006-04-29T11:42:00.000Z	sethk	Daskies	use  cp -av
2006-04-29T11:43:00.000Z	sethk	Daskies	the -v just makes it noisier; the -a tells it to copy everything about the files, permissions, mod times, etc.
2006-04-29T11:43:00.000Z	Daskies	sethk	what's -av ?
2006-04-29T11:43:00.000Z	sethk	Daskies	again, if that's the behavior you want, but most often it's the best choice
