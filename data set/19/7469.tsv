2007-08-17T08:15:00.000Z	winblows		where can i configure how fast the compiz cube moves?
2007-08-17T08:16:00.000Z	shiester_miester	winblows	in compiz cube settings
2007-08-17T08:16:00.000Z	shiester_miester	winblows	although it depends what sort of cube movement you are talking about
2007-08-17T08:16:00.000Z	winblows	shiester_miester	where is that?
2007-08-17T08:16:00.000Z	winblows	shiester_miester	i'm just talking about how fast it spins
2007-08-17T08:16:00.000Z	shiester_miester	winblows	open up the compiz settings application
2007-08-17T08:17:00.000Z	shiester_miester	winblows	there are multiple ways to spin the cube, so it depends which one you are talking about.  do you mean when you drag a window around the edges? or when you spin it by grabbing with the mouse?
2007-08-17T08:17:00.000Z	winblows	shiester_miester	i'm spinning with my keyboard
2007-08-17T08:17:00.000Z	shiester_miester	winblows	so with ctrl+alt+left/right, or something like that
2007-08-17T08:18:00.000Z	winblows	shiester_miester	that's correct
2007-08-17T08:18:00.000Z	shiester_miester	winblows	have you even looked at the settings app
2007-08-17T08:19:00.000Z	winblows	shiester_miester	probably not... this is day 1 on ubuntu for me
2007-08-17T08:19:00.000Z	winblows	shiester_miester	so where is the settings app?
2007-08-17T08:21:00.000Z	shiester_miester	winblows	its in the main menu
2007-08-17T08:23:00.000Z	winblows	shiester_miester	what's it called?
2007-08-17T08:23:00.000Z	shiester_miester	winblows	something like compiz settings
2007-08-17T08:23:00.000Z	shiester_miester	winblows	I'm not in ubuntu at the moment so I can't tell you for sure, but its certainly not something subtle and obscure
2007-08-17T08:23:00.000Z	winblows	shiester_miester	i don't have anything with compiz on it
2007-08-17T08:24:00.000Z	shiester_miester	winblows	maybe you should ask in #opencompositing...they made compiz
