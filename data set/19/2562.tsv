2010-03-02T06:54:00.000Z	Nolan2	brjann	does sudo chmod -R a+w /directory also CHMOD the files inside the directory
2010-03-02T06:54:00.000Z	brjann	Nolan2	_juca: correct, chmod -R operates on directories and files
2010-03-02T06:54:00.000Z	brjann	Nolan2	do you just want to do directories?
2010-03-02T06:55:00.000Z	brjann	Nolan2	then chmod -R is what you want :)
2010-03-02T07:00:00.000Z	Nolan2	brjann	how do I chmod a file with a space in the directory?
2010-03-02T07:00:00.000Z	brjann	Nolan2	"Directory\ With\ Spaces"
2010-03-02T07:01:00.000Z	brjann	Nolan2	wait, actually, you don't need the backslashes if you're using double quotes, my bad. just "Directory With Spaces" would work
2010-03-02T07:03:00.000Z	Nolan2	brjann	I just did chmod -R "Azerus Downloads" and it said Chmod: missing operand after 'Azureus Downloads'
2010-03-02T07:03:00.000Z	brjann	Nolan2	you didn't give it a mode
2010-03-02T07:05:00.000Z	brjann	Nolan2	no, the first letter is some combination of u (user), g (group), o (other), and a (all). then +, -, or =. then some combination of r (read), w (write), and x (execute). so a+r would be "all plus read", go-w = "group and other minus write", etc
2010-03-02T07:10:00.000Z	Nolan2	brjann	i just did sudo chmod -R a+w "My Music" yet it's telling me You do not have the permissions necessary to view the contents of "My Music"
2010-03-02T07:10:00.000Z	brjann	Nolan2	what's the output of   ls -l "My Music"   ?
2010-03-02T07:12:00.000Z	brjann	Nolan2	how about     ls -l .     and copy/paste the line for that directory
2010-03-02T07:16:00.000Z	Nolan2	brjann	total 96
2010-03-02T07:17:00.000Z	brjann	Nolan2	hm, there's no reason you shouldn't be able to read that directory
2010-03-02T07:18:00.000Z	Nolan2	brjann	how would I go about transferring those directories and their contents to a flash drive using terminal?
2010-03-02T07:18:00.000Z	brjann	Nolan2	well you can't if it won't let you read the directories ;)
2010-03-02T07:21:00.000Z	Nolan2	brjann	I can read the files off of the windows installation rofl.
2010-03-02T07:21:00.000Z	brjann	Nolan2	haha
