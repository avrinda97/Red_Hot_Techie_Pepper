2009-09-09T18:58:00.000Z	EF_Codd		I got a Asus 1000HE netbook. I didn't think it would be, but it's the best computer I've bought lol
2009-09-09T18:58:00.000Z	EF_Codd		i hardly use my "real" laptop anymore
2009-09-09T18:59:00.000Z	SingAlong	EF_Codd	you like it so much?
2009-09-09T18:59:00.000Z	SingAlong	EF_Codd	what apps do you use normally?
2009-09-09T18:59:00.000Z	EF_Codd	SingAlong	yeah, I can just chuck it in my bag and take it to university and have it run for 9 hours on the battery
2009-09-09T19:00:00.000Z	EF_Codd	SingAlong	the thing I use the most is Visual Studio 2008 with windows, and eclipse/netbeans/various compilers when using linux. Nothing too heavy
2009-09-09T19:01:00.000Z	SingAlong	EF_Codd	eclipse is heavy! i had to upgrade my comp to 3gb ram to run it happily while playing music and surfing. :)
2009-09-09T19:02:00.000Z	EF_Codd	SingAlong	I guess it depends how you have it configured ... I have no probs. It is more bloated than VS 2008 though lol
2009-09-09T19:03:00.000Z	SingAlong	EF_Codd	ya it worked. but i havent tried eclipse on my AAO netbook yet. just been configuring and setting it up since yesterday
2009-09-09T19:05:00.000Z	SingAlong	EF_Codd	i loved netbooks only aftre i saw my dad happily carrying one instead of his laptop.
2009-09-09T19:06:00.000Z	EF_Codd	SingAlong	yeah, like me. The thinkpad seems like a brute now lol
2009-09-09T19:07:00.000Z	SingAlong	EF_Codd	I'm going to buy one of those foldable USB keyboards to carry around. the keys on my Acer Aspire One are too small and not comfy.
2009-09-09T19:07:00.000Z	EF_Codd	SingAlong	yeah, that's why I chose the 1000HE. I actually type faster than at my normal keyboard
2009-09-09T19:07:00.000Z	SingAlong	EF_Codd	you've got bigger keys?
2009-09-09T19:08:00.000Z	EF_Codd	SingAlong	it's 94% of full keyboard, with chicklet keys. And yes, the keyboard is bigger than the Acer
2009-09-09T19:09:00.000Z	SingAlong	EF_Codd	wow.
2009-09-09T19:19:00.000Z	EF_Codd	SingAlong	yes
2009-09-09T19:20:00.000Z	SingAlong	EF_Codd	are you using ext3 or ext4? suggestions on which is better?
2009-09-09T19:20:00.000Z	EF_Codd	SingAlong	I use ext4 with no problems
