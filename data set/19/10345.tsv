2006-09-03T05:41:00.000Z	midgetg0at		missing my "reboot" option from my shutdown menu (red button)...any idea how to get it back?
2006-09-03T05:43:00.000Z	midgetg0at		how about.....I have dualview working correctly, only now i'd like to configure an alternate xorg.conf to be used when i want the desktop to "span" the two monitors....only i cant figureout how to set it up...anyone?
2006-09-03T05:44:00.000Z	holycow_	midgetg0at	are you using an nvidia dualhead card by chance?
2006-09-03T05:44:00.000Z	holycow_	midgetg0at	i can send you my xorg file, i have dual monis using that nvidia dealie for doing it
2006-09-03T05:44:00.000Z	holycow_	midgetg0at	please don't use automatix
2006-09-03T05:44:00.000Z	holycow_	midgetg0at	if you are using automatix, just as a friend
2006-09-03T05:46:00.000Z	holycow_	midgetg0at	what ompaul said.
2006-09-03T05:46:00.000Z	holycow_	midgetg0at	you want my xorg file?
2006-09-03T05:47:00.000Z	holycow_	midgetg0at	full width across both monis ...
2006-09-03T05:49:00.000Z	holycow_	midgetg0at	no biggie, do something about the automatix thing, i really wish we could get that thing killed
2006-09-03T05:50:00.000Z	holycow_	midgetg0at	its easy enough, just backup /home
2006-09-03T05:50:00.000Z	holycow_	midgetg0at	well renaming xorg files and ctrl/aslt/backspace to restart x, or just logout and login
2006-09-03T05:51:00.000Z	holycow_	midgetg0at	i heard about that but never really thought about it, appologies
2006-09-03T05:55:00.000Z	holycow_	midgetg0at	well one of the things :)
2006-09-03T05:56:00.000Z	holycow_	midgetg0at	there are a LOT of things that bring people to a platform, ubuntu made a HUUUGE step in that direction (thank you mark for spending your mmillions)
2006-09-03T06:07:00.000Z	holycow_	midgetg0at	just ask.  lots of people in here that know more than me
