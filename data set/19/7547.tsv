2008-02-01T23:55:00.000Z	linux1	serenityUK	thats done nothing mate
2008-02-01T23:58:00.000Z	serenityUK	linux1	sorry it must be just a write-protect flag not an open process
2008-02-01T23:59:00.000Z	serenityUK	linux1	what about    fuser -v /var/cahce/debconf/config.dat
2008-02-01T23:59:00.000Z	serenityUK	linux1	without spelling mistake lol
2008-02-02T00:10:00.000Z	linux1	serenityUK	i just get Cannot stat /var/cahce/debconf/config.dat: No such file or directory  Cannot stat /var/cahce/debconf/config.dat: No such file or directory
2008-02-02T00:19:00.000Z	serenityUK	linux1	sorry i said in second message about my spelling mistake  look i wrote  cahce  instead of  cache
2008-02-02T00:40:00.000Z	linux1	serenityUK	sorry eating my dinner ,still not output with that spelt the right way
2008-02-02T00:49:00.000Z	serenityUK	linux1	have you tried rebooting?
2008-02-02T00:55:00.000Z	serenityUK	linux1	try      sudo dpkg --configure -a     &&       sudo apt-get -f install
2008-02-02T00:57:00.000Z	linux1	serenityUK	i have tryed that allready and just again but im getting the same message
2008-02-02T00:59:00.000Z	serenityUK	linux1	i've fixed it before it's bugging me that I can't find the answer again..   I think there is a lock file that is created when you open synaptic that stops you running apt-get at same time etc... if you delete the lock file as root it works
2008-02-02T01:00:00.000Z	serenityUK	linux1	all the searches so far have given previous advice
2008-02-02T01:01:00.000Z	linux1	serenityUK	when i find the file i will
2008-02-02T01:02:00.000Z	serenityUK	linux1	does the error msg say something at the top such as   Could not get lock /var/lib/apt/lock   ?
2008-02-02T01:02:00.000Z	linux1	serenityUK	no
2008-02-02T01:02:00.000Z	serenityUK	linux1	be careful deleting files as root lol..  it's a very specific file
2008-02-02T01:03:00.000Z	linux1	serenityUK	hehehe i know ;)
2008-02-02T01:07:00.000Z	linux1	serenityUK	still not joy
