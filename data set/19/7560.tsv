2008-01-25T13:12:00.000Z	drgeb		Anyone know how I can disable ALT Space in GNOME to show that menu window but instead bring up Katapult ?
2008-01-25T13:13:00.000Z	blayde	drgeb	have you looked at the 'keyboard shortcuts' thing?
2008-01-25T13:14:00.000Z	drgeb		yep but does not work
2008-01-25T13:14:00.000Z	blayde	drgeb	what did you try?
2008-01-25T13:15:00.000Z	drgeb		I disabled what it was set to for I believe Activate Window menu
2008-01-25T13:16:00.000Z	drgeb	blayde	so in the list that comes up I don't see anymore ALT Space entry
2008-01-25T13:16:00.000Z	blayde	drgeb	does alt-space still do anything?
2008-01-25T13:17:00.000Z	drgeb	blayde	however ALT Space still pops up a menu
2008-01-25T13:17:00.000Z	drgeb	blayde	just noticed that alt-space when a window is not selected does nothing and when any window or app is seletced it brings up the menu
2008-01-25T13:17:00.000Z	blayde	drgeb	is your window manager metacity? have you tried restarting the x server?
2008-01-25T13:18:00.000Z	drgeb		how do i determine if its metacity ?
2008-01-25T13:19:00.000Z	blayde	drgeb	i guess a better question would be if you've turned on special desktop effect...
2008-01-25T13:19:00.000Z	drgeb	blayde	I did try restarting xserver CTRL ALT BackSpace
2008-01-25T13:20:00.000Z	blayde	drgeb	you can tell if it's metacity with ps -A | grep metacity
2008-01-25T13:20:00.000Z	drgeb		vlayde its compiz
2008-01-25T13:20:00.000Z	drgeb	blayde	its compiz
2008-01-25T13:21:00.000Z	blayde	drgeb	i know there is supposed to be a gconf backend for compiz to use the controls from 'keyboard shortcuts'
2008-01-25T13:22:00.000Z	blayde	drgeb	perhaps it's looking elsewhere for the config...
2008-01-25T13:29:00.000Z	blayde	drgeb	good luck w/ your tweaking - i need sleep
