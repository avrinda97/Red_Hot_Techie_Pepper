2004-10-01T14:32:00.000Z	JStrike		How is the out-the box multimedia support btw?
2004-10-01T14:32:00.000Z	tseng	JStrike	good for open source codecs
2004-10-01T14:33:00.000Z	tseng	JStrike	bad for dvds/proprietary stuff out of the box
2004-10-22T06:39:00.000Z	JStrike	tseng	: Are you the mono packager for Ubuntu?
2004-10-22T06:43:00.000Z	tseng	JStrike	not officially
2004-10-22T06:44:00.000Z	JStrike	tseng	: I know :-)
2004-10-22T06:45:00.000Z	tseng	JStrike	then yes I guess.
2004-10-22T06:45:00.000Z	JStrike	tseng	: What I wanted to know is if you would consider expanding your repo so that it is similar to MDE (or was until a couple of days ago). I am considering change to Ubuntu from SuSE, but the mono support is quite important to me
2004-10-22T06:46:00.000Z	JStrike	tseng	: Basically adding inotify kernels, Beagle, iFolder
2004-10-22T06:54:00.000Z	JStrike	tseng	: So how about it? Any chance of inotify kernels, beagle and ifolder?
2004-10-30T13:37:00.000Z	JStrike	tseng	has it in his repo iirc 
2004-11-04T09:00:00.000Z	JStrike	tseng	: You in?
2004-11-04T09:05:00.000Z	tseng	JStrike	sure
2004-11-04T09:13:00.000Z	JStrike	tseng	: Muine should preferably use the gstreamer-backend now the gstreamer is up to scratch, or at least have the xine backend use alsa instead of OSS
2004-11-04T09:14:00.000Z	tseng	JStrike	yes im aware. thanks
2004-11-04T09:16:00.000Z	JStrike	tseng	: Ah. Also, any luck making Beagle and iFolder packages? 
2004-11-04T09:16:00.000Z	tseng	JStrike	jdub was working on ifolder i believe. search the wiki for a beagle howto
2004-11-04T09:17:00.000Z	JStrike	tseng	: I know how to get beagle working :-) I was talking about creating packages for people
2004-11-04T09:18:00.000Z	JStrike	tseng	: good stuff
