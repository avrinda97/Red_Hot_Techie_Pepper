2008-07-11T21:42:00.000Z	DieseL`nix		anyone know of a fix for samba in gutsy?
2008-07-11T21:42:00.000Z	DieseL`nix		when i map a windows share it gives and error, then sort of maps it twice?
2008-07-11T21:43:00.000Z	DieseL`nix		anyone aware of the broken samba in ubuntu 8.04?
2008-07-11T21:44:00.000Z	DieseL`nix		it happens on every install of gutsy i've done
2008-07-11T21:45:00.000Z	DieseL`nix		"The specified location is not mounted"
2008-07-11T21:45:00.000Z	DieseL`nix		Jeruvy,
2008-07-11T21:46:00.000Z	DieseL`nix		it appears on the desktop, when i try to open it it sort of mounts a second time
2008-07-11T21:46:00.000Z	DieseL`nix		both mounts disappear after a restart
2008-07-11T21:47:00.000Z	unop	DieseL`nix	if you wish for a partition to be mounted automatically at startup -- make an entry for it in /etc/fstab
2008-07-11T21:50:00.000Z	unop	DieseL`nix	mount your samba shares in /etc/fstab
2008-07-11T21:51:00.000Z	DieseL`nix	unop	and they will appear as volumes on my desktop?
2008-07-11T21:52:00.000Z	unop	DieseL`nix	you can have shortcuts to the mount-points on your desktop, launchers to them or even mount stuff directly on your desktop (which probably won't look as good)
2008-07-11T21:52:00.000Z	DieseL`nix	unop	i want exactly what "connect to server" gave me
2008-07-11T21:52:00.000Z	unop	DieseL`nix	i don't know what that is - i don't use gnome
2008-07-11T21:53:00.000Z	unop	DieseL`nix	right
2008-07-11T21:54:00.000Z	unop	DieseL`nix	well yes, obviously
2008-07-11T21:54:00.000Z	DieseL`nix	unop	it's no good to me then, i'm on a laptop
2008-07-11T21:55:00.000Z	unop	DieseL`nix	you need to be connected to a network if you want to mount a remote share -- using nautilus or otherwise
