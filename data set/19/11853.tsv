2005-11-23T12:45:00.000Z	Amaranth	dirkson	Please don't repeat yourself.
2005-11-23T12:46:00.000Z	dirkson	Amaranth	Ah! So I should just leave if no one notices my post, then?
2005-11-23T12:46:00.000Z	Amaranth	dirkson	It's gst-register-0.8
2005-11-23T12:46:00.000Z	dirkson	Amaranth	Thank you : )
2005-11-23T12:47:00.000Z	Amaranth	dirkson	No, but try to have enough patience to wait more than 2 minutes.
2005-11-23T12:47:00.000Z	dirkson	Amaranth	Meh, perhaps this is true. It is a busy chatroom.
2005-11-23T12:48:00.000Z	Amaranth	dirkson	Yeah, I can see something getting lost in the noise but your first message was still on the screen. :P
2005-11-23T12:48:00.000Z	dirkson	Amaranth	*blinks* Really? .... I should probably resize my window from standard :D
2005-11-23T12:48:00.000Z	dirkson	Amaranth	That'll make the chatroom a lot easy to understand, eh? ;)
2005-11-23T12:50:00.000Z	dirkson	Amaranth	Heya!!!! Sucess! Sound! My giant CD player works! (Ok, so I really want the other computer to do more than that, but right now it's just a CD player with VNC access :D
2005-11-23T12:52:00.000Z	Amaranth	dirkson	congrats, i'll file a bug report about the name issue
2005-11-23T12:53:00.000Z	dirkson	Amaranth	*blinks* Oh, was it really a name issue? 32bit ubuntu, breezy, if that helps any. Running on a stone age celeron.
2005-11-23T12:53:00.000Z	Amaranth	dirkson	The app told you to run gst-register but the program was called gst-register-0.8. That's the name issue. :)
2005-11-23T12:55:00.000Z	dirkson	Amaranth	Ahhh, true : ) It's curious that it asked me to do that, anyway. I don't remember that step on my laptop. Then again, I had to do so much funky stuff with the laptop, I may just have forgotten.
2005-11-23T12:58:00.000Z	dirkson	Amaranth	Ok, good. Now that we've got that step done, I just need to get NAT working....... *stares at the ipmasq man page* Oh, man.
2005-11-23T12:59:00.000Z	Amaranth	dirkson	what he said, i guess. I don't do NAT with a linux box.
2005-11-23T13:00:00.000Z	dirkson	Amaranth	Basically, I'm going to use the other box for skype while I play America's Army. I figure making the other box run skype through a nat is easier than recompiling the openal library on a 64 bit machine.... *grins*
