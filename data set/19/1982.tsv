2010-08-08T06:01:00.000Z	Palm76		Hey guy's. I have a problem. I installed Windows 7 and afterwards I wanted to reinstall grub to the mbr.For some reason grub wouldn't reinstall to the mbr en I did something really dumb. I cleared the mbr with "dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda bs=512 count=1". When I realized what I did it was too late. The entire mbr is erased including the partition table. Is there a way te rewrite the partition table without loosing everything or am I screwed?
2010-08-08T06:02:00.000Z	wildbat	Palm76	try testdisk
2010-08-08T06:03:00.000Z	Palm76		@ Wildbat: I already downloaded the static binary but I can't figure out how to start it
2010-08-08T06:05:00.000Z	wildbat	Palm76	huh start from !terminal ~
2010-08-08T06:05:00.000Z	Palm76		Here's the output of fdisk -l. Disk /dev/sda: 500.1 GB, 500107862016 bytes

2010-08-08T06:08:00.000Z	wildbat	Palm76	testdisk can recover your disk
2010-08-08T06:10:00.000Z	Palm76		@ wildbat: I made it executable and tried to execute it from the commandline but it doesn't start
2010-08-08T06:10:00.000Z	wildbat	Palm76	huh? you can install it from apt ~ " apt-get install testdisk"
2010-08-08T06:11:00.000Z	Palm76	wildbat	I didn;t know that. I'll install it right now.
2010-08-08T06:16:00.000Z	Palm76		Well, testdisk is running and at least it found the first primary partition formatted to NTFS
2010-08-08T06:17:00.000Z	wildbat	Palm76	give it some time ~ no worry you can recover all
2010-08-08T06:18:00.000Z	wildbat	Palm76	it will have to scan for the whole disk which take times
2010-08-08T06:18:00.000Z	Palm76	wildbat	I hope so.
