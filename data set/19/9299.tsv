2006-12-04T08:22:00.000Z	yuk	ineedmoney	you could run mplayer in console and see what's wrong with you
2006-12-04T08:25:00.000Z	yuk	ineedmoney	but vlc can not play wmv files
2006-12-04T08:27:00.000Z	yuk	ineedmoney	maybe you could try alternative video output
2006-12-04T08:27:00.000Z	yuk	ineedmoney	mplayer -vo xxx
2006-12-04T08:32:00.000Z	yuk	ineedmoney	but you can play video media without X,
2006-12-04T08:33:00.000Z	yuk	ineedmoney	so it's not the problem of graphic card driver
2006-12-04T08:35:00.000Z	yuk	ineedmoney	maybe you could try xine
