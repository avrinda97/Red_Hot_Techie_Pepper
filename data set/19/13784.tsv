2005-08-10T13:20:00.000Z	desrt		BeatYou; well.. the general concept behind the offset method is to auto-preload without using evil hacks
2005-08-10T13:20:00.000Z	desrt		BeatYou; so you get preload for free no matter what
2005-08-10T13:20:00.000Z	desrt		:)
2005-08-10T13:20:00.000Z	desrt		css is the present
