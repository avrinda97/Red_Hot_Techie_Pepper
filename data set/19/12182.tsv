2006-09-13T05:41:00.000Z	tscherler		use tabs instead of new windows
2006-09-13T05:41:00.000Z	tscherler		hi all
2006-09-13T05:42:00.000Z	tscherler		I just finished to install draper but my wifi card is not finding any access points
2006-09-13T05:42:00.000Z	tscherler		with breezy that was no prob at all
2006-09-13T05:42:00.000Z	ootput	tscherler	in firefox preferences? I've already done that. The problem is that gaim complains that a firefox window is already open, and that it can't open up a new one
2006-09-13T05:42:00.000Z	tscherler		hmm
2006-09-13T05:42:00.000Z	tscherler		lemme try
