2010-12-24T13:12:00.000Z	ryjyd		hello campers, I've got a hardware/driver/software/suggestion box kind of question
2010-12-24T13:13:00.000Z	ryjyd		specifically to pro sound cards used for recording studios and whatnot
2010-12-24T13:13:00.000Z	DasEi	ryjyd	avoid x-fis
2010-12-24T13:14:00.000Z	ryjyd		begging your pardon, not sure what you're asking of me
2010-12-24T13:15:00.000Z	DasEi	ryjyd	there are certain profs frm creative, the x-fi series, often caused trouble in the past /w linux
2010-12-24T13:15:00.000Z	ryjyd		ohhh... gotcha
2010-12-24T13:16:00.000Z	DasEi	ryjyd	soundblaster, amongst others serve well, check alsaproject.org
2010-12-24T13:16:00.000Z	DasEi	ryjyd	also there are various databases concernning a certain hardware under linux
2010-12-24T13:16:00.000Z	DasEi		!hw
2010-12-24T13:16:00.000Z	DasEi		!hardware
2010-12-24T13:16:00.000Z	ryjyd	DasEi	most of what I've been running into has been leaning on usb2.0, but I've also read that this is a bad nono, as there's just not enough bus to haul the sound after two tracks, and this is kinda what I'm worried about
2010-12-24T13:17:00.000Z	DasEi		^might not be the youngest, ryjyd
2010-12-24T13:18:00.000Z	DasEi	ryjyd	I'm no expert on that, but can tell I helped with rosegarden using usb, and it was fine (usb2.0)
2010-12-24T13:18:00.000Z	DasEi	ryjyd	profs will want to use ocle
2010-12-24T13:18:00.000Z	DasEi		p*
2010-12-24T13:18:00.000Z	ryjyd	DasEi	 alsaproject.org leads to a dead-end... looks like whoever the domain was bough from now is leaving ads to wherever on it...
2010-12-24T13:19:00.000Z	ryjyd	DasEi	rosegarden is for midi-like "stuff" isn't it?
2010-12-24T13:19:00.000Z	DasEi	ryjyd	yes, supporting usb quite well; http://www.alsa-project.org/
2010-12-24T13:20:00.000Z	ryjyd	DasEi	that's the link... thx
