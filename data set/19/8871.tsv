2007-01-26T07:03:00.000Z	Cryoniq	tulga	Mounting / to the first SCSI and its partition should be easy..
2007-01-26T07:03:00.000Z	Cryoniq	tulga	then you want to mount /home over the remaining 2 SCSI drives together?
2007-01-26T07:03:00.000Z	tulga		yes
2007-01-26T07:03:00.000Z	tulga		mount / to 1st SCSI is ok
2007-01-26T07:03:00.000Z	Cryoniq	tulga	then I think you need to raid those 2
2007-01-26T07:04:00.000Z	tulga		ok
2007-01-26T07:04:00.000Z	Cryoniq	tulga	and then mount /home to that patition spanning over those 2 discs
2007-01-26T07:04:00.000Z	tulga		ok
2007-01-26T07:05:00.000Z	Cryoniq		Tulga so what you want to look for is how to raid those 2 SCSI disks and partion them and then how to change so that /home is mounted on that partition
2007-01-26T07:05:00.000Z	tulga		yes. same size
2007-01-26T07:05:00.000Z	tulga		ok
2007-01-26T07:06:00.000Z	tulga		thanks all
2007-01-26T07:06:00.000Z	Cryoniq	tulga	aye Frogzoo is right. If you raid 5 those 2 disks together you mirror them between them. That means that you only will use half of them though so
2007-01-26T07:06:00.000Z	Cryoniq	tulga	those 2's diskspace will become disk1+disk2 / 2 of amount
2007-01-26T07:07:00.000Z	Cryoniq	tulga	but it is priceless if one of the harddrives break and have all data still there
