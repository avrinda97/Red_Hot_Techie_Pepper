2010-04-23T02:29:00.000Z	xangua	Spoils	system> administration> software origins
2010-04-23T02:30:00.000Z	xangua	Spoils	in the fist tab enable all repositorioes (except for source code) ; then reload and install ubuntu-restricted-extras
2010-04-23T02:30:00.000Z	xangua	Spoils	you can do it from terminal, synaptic or the software center
2010-04-23T02:31:00.000Z	Spoils	xangua	 the first 4 options were already checked, mate
2010-04-23T02:32:00.000Z	xangua	Spoils	and it doesn't appear in synaptic¿¿
