2006-07-31T12:12:00.000Z	thundr		Is there a defrag command for linux?
2006-07-31T12:13:00.000Z	mwe	thundr	ext3 file systems don't suffer much from fragmentation
2006-07-31T12:13:00.000Z	thundr	mwe	what about reiser?
2006-07-31T12:14:00.000Z	mwe	thundr	reiserfs is dangerous but I don
2006-07-31T12:14:00.000Z	mwe	thundr	reiserfs is dangerous but I don't think it suffers much from fragmentation either
2006-07-31T12:16:00.000Z	mwe	thundr	you can't convert safely but converfs will do it. it's by no means safe though
2006-07-31T12:19:00.000Z	thundr	mwe	sethk So the filesystem I should use for the next install is ext3?
2006-07-31T12:20:00.000Z	mwe	thundr	I'm using jfs. mostly just to be different but in theory it should be a little safer at the cost of a little speed
2006-07-31T12:21:00.000Z	thundr	mwe	that's mostly why I chose reiser - something different (but there weren't any explanations during the install)
2006-07-31T12:22:00.000Z	mwe	thundr	many ex fans of reiserfs learned the hard way ;)
2006-07-31T12:22:00.000Z	mwe	thundr	me included
2006-07-31T12:25:00.000Z	thundr	mwe	do you know how big is the performance hit is compared to ext3?  50% or just 5%?
2006-07-31T12:26:00.000Z	mwe	thundr	actually it's faster for large files
2006-07-31T12:26:00.000Z	mwe	thundr	but some 10% or sth like that
2006-07-31T12:26:00.000Z	thundr	mwe	that's certainly not huge
2006-07-31T12:26:00.000Z	mwe	thundr	it's somewhat slower when accessing huge directory trees but uses way less cpu
2006-07-31T12:28:00.000Z	mwe	thundr	no. it's more than 10% faster for very large files but about 10% slower in general I'd say
2006-07-31T12:29:00.000Z	mwe	thundr	I can see the difference when copying a large file or searching a large directory tree
2006-07-31T12:30:00.000Z	mwe	thundr	jfs is faster when I copy a large file but slower if I use find in the root for example
