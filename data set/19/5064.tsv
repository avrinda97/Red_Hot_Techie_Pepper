2010-12-31T07:51:00.000Z	icarus-c	lboken	what's good with LVM is that you could join volume on different hard drives as ONE big partition
2010-12-31T07:54:00.000Z	icarus-c	lboken	i would use LVM to join both hard drives. and partition with it. that way you could have a big continuous partition for data (250GB + (120GB - OS size) )
2010-12-31T07:56:00.000Z	icarus-c	lboken	if you use LVM, you could make a 370GB 'partition'  out of your 250GB & 120GB hard disks.  but separating OS & data on different partitions is a good idea.
2010-12-31T07:56:00.000Z	lboken	icarus-c	i dont have lvm option on the installation
2010-12-31T07:58:00.000Z	icarus-c	lboken	anywhere you want it
2010-12-31T08:00:00.000Z	icarus-c	lboken	if you ask me. i would make one partition on the big hard disk,  and mount -t bind  to proper place on the OS
2010-12-31T08:00:00.000Z	icarus-c	lboken	say on the big hard disk, you have one partition, containing 2 folders "home" & "var"     then you mount -t bind these 2 folders back to /home  & /var
2010-12-31T08:01:00.000Z	icarus-c	lboken	that way you don't have to split 2 partitions and resize them like hell when you need to adjust partition size
2010-12-31T08:02:00.000Z	icarus-c	lboken	let ubuntu install on the small hard disk first. after installation, then work on the big hard disk and do the binding
2010-12-31T08:03:00.000Z	icarus-c	lboken	since ubuntu installer is lacking of customization options
2010-12-31T08:03:00.000Z	icarus-c	lboken	unless you use the alternative installer
2010-12-31T08:04:00.000Z	icarus-c	lboken	but the OS would use less than 20GB i suppose so you should still have spare ~100GB on the small disk :P
2010-12-31T08:31:00.000Z	icarus-c	lboken	what is the output of "lspci |grep Network  "
