2009-07-09T13:15:00.000Z	MindVirus		I can barely hear any sound when my volume's turned up 100%. Any suggestions?
2009-07-09T13:15:00.000Z	MindVirus		Is there any way to boost volume past 100%?
2009-07-09T13:16:00.000Z	vise	MindVirus	Use VLC.. it allows up to 400%.
2009-07-09T13:16:00.000Z	vise	MindVirus	Alternatively, open volume control and turn up all internal volumes too.
2009-07-09T13:16:00.000Z	MindVirus	vise	I dd.
2009-07-09T13:17:00.000Z	MindVirus	vise	I mean system-wide.
2009-07-09T13:18:00.000Z	vise	MindVirus	Nope.. I haven't found a way to do that.. But you need probably a sound post-processor which will have a preamplifier...
2009-07-09T13:18:00.000Z	MindVirus	vise	what do you recommend?
2009-07-09T13:18:00.000Z	vise	MindVirus	I will search for one. I don't know.. If i find, i'll let you know..
2009-07-09T13:19:00.000Z	MindVirus	vise	oh, thanks!
2009-07-09T13:31:00.000Z	vise	MindVirus	While there are no programs I could find for sound post processors, are you sure you have turned up all the controls after right clicking volume icon and selecting "Open volume control" ?
2009-07-09T13:32:00.000Z	MindVirus	vise	yes.
2009-07-09T13:32:00.000Z	vise	MindVirus	Okay.. Gimme a few more minutes..
2009-07-09T13:39:00.000Z	vise	MindVirus	Download this package called gnome-alsamixer. It will give you a lot of volume controls. Try tweaking all of them and see if you get the volume you deserve...
2009-07-09T13:40:00.000Z	MindVirus	vise	alright. I'll tell you about it in a second.
2009-07-09T13:44:00.000Z	MindVirus	vise	that did not help -- same options as with the default volume control.
2009-07-09T13:45:00.000Z	vise	MindVirus	Okay.. one last method.. Go to System->Preferences->Sound and select different devices in the sound playback drop down and test each one to find out which one gives you the maximum volume..
2009-07-09T13:47:00.000Z	MindVirus	vise	all of them give the same volume. Some could not be used for playback, but one COULD be used for playback but gave NO sound (as opposed to very quiet).
2009-07-09T13:47:00.000Z	vise	MindVirus	Hmm.. Im stumped!
