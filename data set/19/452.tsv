2012-02-17T11:53:00.000Z	tjadc		Hello
2012-02-17T11:54:00.000Z	cfhowlett	tjadc	  greetings
2012-02-17T11:55:00.000Z	tjadc		I have an Asus(N61J) with a NVidia(GT325M) graphics card, which I am having trouble getting working
2012-02-17T11:55:00.000Z	tjadc		I have tried installing  bumblebee with no luck
2012-02-17T11:56:00.000Z	tjadc		When I install the nvidia-current driver and do a X configuration with it, the configuration is incorrect or fails
2012-02-17T11:56:00.000Z	tjadc		I am running Ubuntu 12.04
2012-02-17T11:56:00.000Z	tjadc		I was running 10.04 but had similar/same issues
2012-02-17T11:56:00.000Z	cfhowlett		!precise|tjadc
2012-02-17T11:57:00.000Z	tjadc	cfhowlett	great, but 'Precise' didn't solve my problems :(
2012-02-17T11:58:00.000Z	tjadc		I would have thought that this laptop and its hardware are old enough on the market for Ubuntu to have made the necessary developments to support my laptop's hardware
2012-02-17T11:58:00.000Z	cfhowlett	tjadc	  12.04 isn't supported on this channel yet.  #ubuntu+1 might be able to help you out though.
2012-02-17T11:58:00.000Z	tjadc		Well that is fine ..
2012-02-17T11:58:00.000Z	tjadc		Ubuntu 12.04 isn't the problem I believe
2012-02-17T11:58:00.000Z	tjadc		as mentioned before, I was running 10.04
2012-02-17T11:59:00.000Z	cfhowlett	tjadc	  sorry but it DOES release in only 3 months!
2012-02-17T11:59:00.000Z	tjadc		That's great to hear, but Ubuntu isn't my problem
2012-02-17T11:59:00.000Z	tjadc		my problem is getting the graphics to run
2012-02-17T12:00:00.000Z	cfhowlett	tjadc	  fiair enough
2012-02-17T12:00:00.000Z	cfhowlett	tjadc	  *fair* enough
