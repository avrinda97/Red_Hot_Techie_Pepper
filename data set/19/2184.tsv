2010-06-03T16:08:00.000Z	vishaltelangre	nyuszika7h	what was your question/
2010-06-03T16:09:00.000Z	nyuszika7h	vishaltelangre	here are my questions: 1. Even if I change language, the login screen and the software center's some parts remain the old language. 2. If I try to change Digital Vibrance or Image Sharpening in NVIDIA X Server Settings, it quits immediately. 3.) Can I change the password dots to be smaller? It was bigger with other Linux distributions, like Mandriva, too. 4.) There are no Cancel or Restore Defaults  buttons in many plac
2010-06-03T16:11:00.000Z	vishaltelangre	nyuszika7h	this means that you chosen language is not fully translated yet..
2010-06-03T16:12:00.000Z	vishaltelangre	nyuszika7h	regarding "changing password dot size", I also having no idea yet, I'm also a beginner too..
