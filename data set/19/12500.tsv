2006-04-21T16:00:00.000Z	bjorn_		How can I check to see if I have GTK installed?
2006-04-21T16:00:00.000Z	bjorn_		hi
2006-04-21T16:00:00.000Z	JDahl	bjorn_	ls /usr/lib/libgtk*
2006-04-21T16:01:00.000Z	bjorn_		ty
2006-04-21T16:06:00.000Z	bjorn_	JDahl	I downloaded gtk+-2.8.0, but I don't know how to install it
2006-04-21T16:06:00.000Z	JDahl	bjorn_	If you use aptitude (the package-manager) or one of the graphical frontends for it, it will install and configure the software for you
2006-04-21T16:07:00.000Z	bjorn_		ok ill try
2006-04-21T16:19:00.000Z	bjorn_	JDahl	can you help me again?
2006-04-21T16:19:00.000Z	JDahl	bjorn_	everyone here tries to help... just ask away - someone else will probably also pitch in
2006-04-21T16:20:00.000Z	bjorn_		k..
2006-04-21T16:20:00.000Z	bjorn_		i did this
2006-04-21T16:20:00.000Z	bjorn_		tar xvfz gnomad2-2.X.X.tar.gz
2006-04-21T16:20:00.000Z	bjorn_		and it installed or something
2006-04-21T16:20:00.000Z	bjorn_		but this cd gnomad2-2.X.X doesnt work
2006-04-21T16:20:00.000Z	bjorn_		also x.x = 3.8
2006-04-21T16:21:00.000Z	JDahl	bjorn_	what's wrong with the precompiled gnomad package? you could write "sudo apt-get install gnomad2" to install it
2006-04-21T16:22:00.000Z	bjorn_		yes thx, it's installed, but it doesnt find my zen
2006-04-21T16:23:00.000Z	JDahl	bjorn_	compiling and configuring gnomad from source + making sure it works with the rest of precompiled Ubuntu gnome is probably beyond me...
2006-04-21T16:24:00.000Z	JDahl	bjorn_	not I don't want to help - I just wouldnt know where to start
