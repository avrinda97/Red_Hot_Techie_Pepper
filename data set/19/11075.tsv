2006-04-07T10:29:00.000Z	Madpilot	Killgore	if the file is owned by root, that'll be true. If it's owned by $USER, Nautilus w/o root should be fine
2006-04-09T12:20:00.000Z	Madpilot	Killgore	umasks are the reverse of chmod, I think - so umask 777 is no perms at all

2006-04-09T12:21:00.000Z	Killgore	Madpilot	damn
2006-04-09T12:25:00.000Z	Killgore	Madpilot	does it matter that the owner of the drive is root?
2006-04-09T12:26:00.000Z	Madpilot	Killgore	have you read the drive mount page in the wiki?
2006-04-09T12:26:00.000Z	Killgore	Madpilot	no not yet but ive read 2 other things i guess it couldnt hurt

2006-04-16T16:23:00.000Z	Killgore	Madpilot	is there any other software i can install to add more things to the panels, or make panels like on OSX for example
