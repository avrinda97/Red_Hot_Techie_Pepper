2012-07-07T12:45:00.000Z	Diazo		One of the techs told me to zero-fill the drive to try and fix it. Seeing as GParted can't seem to delete my primary partition and Disk Utility doesn't seem like it wants to give in. I did somehow get the drive to format in disk utility.
2012-07-07T12:47:00.000Z	compdoc	Diazo	be sure to enable trim for the drive in /etc/fstab
2012-07-07T12:48:00.000Z	Diazo	compdoc	I never zero-filled a drive before so I pretty much am new to the computer term and doing it.
2012-07-07T12:48:00.000Z	Diazo	compdoc	More or less I'm going to wait for confirmation from the tech.
2012-07-07T12:49:00.000Z	compdoc	Diazo	I dont see any advantages to doing that. but if 'trim' is not enalbed, you'll shorten the life of the ssd
2012-07-07T12:51:00.000Z	Diazo	compdoc	Nice to know that if it shortens the lifespan I can always ask the tech.
2012-07-07T12:52:00.000Z	Diazo	compdoc	Zeroing the drive seems like the only way I can install Ubuntu unless I buy a new SSD which I'm not going to do.
2012-07-07T12:55:00.000Z	compdoc	Diazo	why do you have to zero the drive at all? Because it's hanging at install? Ive had an SSD drive do that to me when it was installed in a computer that didnt support it properly
2012-07-07T12:55:00.000Z	Diazo	compdoc	Because I simply cannot install Ubuntu.
2012-07-07T12:56:00.000Z	Diazo	compdoc	I tried installing Ubuntu using the USB installer to install on top of the SSD. Instead, the USB installs on top of the USB and not the SSD.
2012-07-07T12:57:00.000Z	compdoc	Diazo	that does not sound like theres a problem with the ssd
2012-07-07T13:06:00.000Z	Diazo	compdoc	What had happened is I wanted a fresh install of Ubuntu 12.04 LTS to clear the Ubuntu 11.10 junk out so I went about my business and use the LiveUSB. Went through the installation process and checkmarked 'encrypt my home folder' there was no progress indicator to verify indication of how long it takes to encrypt a drive. So in turn I thought the installation stalled or hanged I mistakenly powered off the machine and Ubuntu wouldn't
2012-07-07T13:08:00.000Z	Diazo	compdoc	From there on end I ended up trying to check GParted and Disk Utility the encrypted partition was not possible to delete it had about 15GB of harddrive space. I tried deleting it in GParted and Disk Utility to no luck...from there when I tried to reinstall Ubuntu for some odd reason it didn't install from the SSD but it installed on the USB.
2012-07-07T13:08:00.000Z	compdoc	Diazo	try without encription? or does it just not work anymore? I would boot gparted and see what the partition looks like, and delete it from there.
2012-07-07T13:10:00.000Z	Diazo	compdoc	I can't delete the primary partition within GParted the delete button is grayed out.
2012-07-07T13:11:00.000Z	Diazo	compdoc	Somewhat implying that it's mounted and can't be unmounted.
2012-07-07T13:11:00.000Z	Diazo	compdoc	No kidding huh.
2012-07-07T13:12:00.000Z	Diazo	compdoc	I'm using GParted on the LiveUSB but isn't so called Live anymore when the installation is completely on the USB.
2012-07-07T13:12:00.000Z	compdoc	Diazo	yeah, its still live if its the install iso
