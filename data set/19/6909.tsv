2007-11-20T17:20:00.000Z	Teknomancer		can someone please paste me their GRUB menu.list file please???  I did not install the bootloader and i get some strange error when Ubuntu boots.
2007-11-20T17:21:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Teknomancer	the odds of theirs working for you is not good
2007-11-20T17:21:00.000Z	Teknomancer	Jack_Sparrow	 yes i'm aware of hte partition numbers
2007-11-20T17:21:00.000Z	Teknomancer	Jack_Sparrow	 i just want to see if it matches my old Debian /initrd etc
2007-11-20T17:22:00.000Z	Teknomancer	Jack_Sparrow	 because i had debian in that partition and installed ubuntu and booted ubuntu without changing menu.lst
2007-11-20T17:23:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Teknomancer	I have feisty on this box so that probably wont help you
2007-11-20T17:24:00.000Z	Teknomancer	Jack_Sparrow	oh here is how the existing menu.lst for Ubuntu looks like, it says Debian but its ubuntu. (pasting only the entry) http://phpfi.com/277520
2007-11-20T17:26:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Teknomancer	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/45220/        is my full version
2007-11-20T17:26:00.000Z	Teknomancer	Jack_Sparrow	 thanks
2007-11-20T17:27:00.000Z	Teknomancer	Jack_Sparrow	 can you just check whether there is a link called "vmlinuz" in /boot of your existing install?
2007-11-20T17:28:00.000Z	Teknomancer	Jack_Sparrow	 and whethere there is a link named "initrd.img"  in /boot
2007-11-20T17:30:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Teknomancer	It looks like I have, but my kernel revisin number is added to it
2007-11-20T17:31:00.000Z	Teknomancer	Jack_Sparrow	 but there has got to be a link named just "initrd" and "vmlinuz" without the version numbers.. or is that in "/" could u check? because the idea is it links to your specific kernel version
2007-11-20T17:32:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Teknomancer	those links are in root
2007-11-20T17:32:00.000Z	Teknomancer	Jack_Sparrow	 ah so you have links named "initrd" and "vmlinuz" (WITHOUT the version numbers in /boot) ? right ?
2007-11-20T17:34:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Teknomancer	yes
2007-11-20T17:35:00.000Z	Teknomancer	Jack_Sparrow	 thx a lot , i'll change my grub entry and try :)
2007-11-20T18:02:00.000Z	Teknomancer	Jack_Sparrow	 fixed it .. it was not /boot or /root
2007-11-20T18:02:00.000Z	Teknomancer	Jack_Sparrow	  it was jsut /initrd.img and /vmlinuz
