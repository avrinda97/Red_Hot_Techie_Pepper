2008-04-29T10:56:00.000Z	ackbahr	Yashy	 (WW) warning, (EE) error, (NI) not implemented, (??) unknown.
2008-04-29T10:56:00.000Z	Yashy	ackbahr	so you're not having any X errors if that was the only line that came back, you have a different issue
2008-04-29T10:57:00.000Z	ackbahr	Yashy	There are different lines, but probably linked to my trials and errors trying to get it back again....
