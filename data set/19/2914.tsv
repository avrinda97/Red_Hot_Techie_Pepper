2010-01-30T12:09:00.000Z	igie	actionparsnip	there is no other profile folder besides the one I renamed initially.
2010-01-30T12:10:00.000Z	igie	actionparsnip	yes I do.. so i guess I am doing something wrong
2010-01-30T12:13:00.000Z	igie	actionparsnip	but there is already a plugins sub-folder in a subfolder called firefox within the .mozilla folder
2010-01-30T12:13:00.000Z	igie	actionparsnip	like so... /.mozilla/firefox/plugins
