2006-04-23T11:28:00.000Z	Gent		anyone alive?
2006-04-23T11:29:00.000Z	Gent		anyone know if there are any plans, ever, to change the default music player in ubuntu to banshee?
2006-04-23T11:29:00.000Z	Gent		or for that matter to include mono and some mono apps in general?
2006-04-23T11:30:00.000Z	spikeb	Gent	mono's already available
2006-04-23T11:31:00.000Z	spikeb	Gent	a good idea in the event that banshee actually freezes less than rhythmbox...whenever that happens.
2006-04-23T11:31:00.000Z	spikeb	Gent	oh rhythmbox is a buggy POS, yes.
2006-04-23T11:32:00.000Z	spikeb	Gent	but it works better than banshee for me, at least on my ppc machine
2006-04-23T11:34:00.000Z	spikeb	Gent	me too :)
2006-04-23T11:35:00.000Z	spikeb	Gent	does your primary desktop happen to run one of the famous proprietary operating systems?
2006-04-23T11:35:00.000Z	Gent	spikeb	no, unless slackware is a famou proprietary operating system
2006-04-23T11:35:00.000Z	spikeb	Gent	hehehehhe no, slackware sure isn't that.
2006-04-23T11:36:00.000Z	spikeb	Gent	slackware is many things to many people, but proprietary ain't one of 'em
2006-04-23T11:37:00.000Z	spikeb	Gent	the menu, no. the applet, yes
2006-04-23T11:41:00.000Z	spikeb	Gent	i did when i had an ibook
2006-04-23T11:47:00.000Z	spikeb	Gent	some codecs, but most of them you have to rely on open source implementations
2006-04-23T11:48:00.000Z	spikeb	Gent	ugh, yes it is
2006-04-23T11:48:00.000Z	spikeb	Gent	there's swfdec
2006-04-23T11:48:00.000Z	spikeb	Gent	which is less crap, but not much
2006-04-23T11:49:00.000Z	spikeb	Gent	there's a project called gnash out there that's already further than any other OSS flash project, i'm looking forward to a stable release
