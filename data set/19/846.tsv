2012-01-06T22:32:00.000Z	Remy		Will Xubuntu 11.10 recognize my Intel's drivers on an ASUS netbook (Eee PC 1001PXD)?  I can't get my system to detect my drivers (if netbooks even have any drivers worth installing).  Also, how can I force Xubuntu to give me Read AND Write permissions to my Windows partition?
2012-01-06T22:33:00.000Z	Remy		Nope.  I go to Additional Drivers, and it doesn't detect anything.  It just says something like "There are no available drivers to be installed."
2012-01-06T22:35:00.000Z	urlin2u	Remy	is the live cd running good? ubuntu will automatically have read write access to windows.
2012-01-06T22:36:00.000Z	Remy		Oh, it's a netbook.  I don't have a CD-ROM drive.
2012-01-06T22:36:00.000Z	urlin2u	Remy	right are you running a live desktop?
2012-01-06T22:38:00.000Z	Remy	urlin2u	I am not, but I am intrigued how using a Live USB would allow my Xubuntu partition to gain permanent Read AND Write access to my Windows partition.  You see, I want to run my Windows programs through Wine, but I've run into problems in the past because I didn't have Write permissions.
2012-01-06T22:39:00.000Z	urlin2u	Remy	I know nothing about wine... a dual boot is a better solution in my personal opinion. Make sure when you post that all the variables are posted rather then oh by the way when I said windows I meant wine.

2012-01-06T22:42:00.000Z	Remy	urlin2u	Well yeah, but both are important to each other.  I can't run my Windows programs through Wine if I can't write "executable file" permissions on my programs.
2012-01-06T22:43:00.000Z	Remy		It's like this: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/ExecutableBit
2012-01-06T22:44:00.000Z	Remy		hey Yaktrack5.
2012-01-06T22:48:00.000Z	urlin2u	Remy	All I can say is I don't know why people even use wine, there are other options, at the worse a 2 min reboot time.
2012-01-06T22:50:00.000Z	Remy	urlin2u	Okay. Thanks dude. Would you know of any other apps that I can use to play my Windows games on Xubuntu?
2012-01-06T22:52:00.000Z	urlin2u	Remy	I'm not a gner so I'm not familiar with stuff there is something called playonlinux you might look at.

2012-01-06T22:52:00.000Z	Remy		Oh! I forgot about virtualbox. I'll have to install that later.  Cool, thanks for the tips, urlin2u and bluegrue
2012-01-06T22:52:00.000Z	Remy		Gtg. bye!
2012-01-06T22:53:00.000Z	urlin2u	Remy	cool I assumed you had thought of a virtual.
