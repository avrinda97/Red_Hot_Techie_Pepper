2010-05-01T03:56:00.000Z	Urden		was the QA team totally asleep for Lucid?  I mean, a show-stopping boot bug?  that's pretty serious
2010-05-01T03:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Urden	not seen a boot bug here
2010-05-01T03:57:00.000Z	Urden	ActionParsnip	see above
2010-05-01T03:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Urden	did you md5 test the iso you downloaded?
2010-05-01T03:57:00.000Z	Urden	ActionParsnip	nope...i shall do that
2010-05-01T03:57:00.000Z	Urden	ActionParsnip	good idea
2010-05-01T03:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Urden	if you dont you have zero chance of knowing what you downloaded is complete or consistant do you?
2010-05-01T03:58:00.000Z	Urden	ActionParsnip	this is true.  but the same issue has been reported by multiple in the beta, so i doubt that's the problem
2010-05-01T03:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Urden	well isolate yours by knowing the iso is good, if it fails md5 you know your data is the blame
2010-05-01T03:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Urden	ALWAYS ALWAYS MD% test the ISO and ALWAYS ALWAYS run the CD checker
2010-05-01T03:59:00.000Z	Urden	ActionParsnip	I would run the CD checker, except the CD won't load...won't load anything at all to let me do that.  I will check md5 now though
2010-05-01T04:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Urden	you should have tested it before burning, garbage data will make garbae CDs
2010-05-01T04:00:00.000Z	Urden	ActionParsnip	yes i agree
2010-05-01T04:02:00.000Z	Urden	ActionParsnip	the md5 is good.  it downloaded fine.  it's a bug
2010-05-01T04:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Urden	try some boot options then
2010-05-01T04:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Urden	and/or disable pointless hardware in bios (like sound/lan)
2010-05-01T04:03:00.000Z	Urden	ActionParsnip	yeah there was a mention of a fix, but how do u access the boot menu on the live to change the command line?
2010-05-01T04:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Urden	shift at boot
2010-05-01T04:03:00.000Z	Urden	ActionParsnip	ok thanks :)
