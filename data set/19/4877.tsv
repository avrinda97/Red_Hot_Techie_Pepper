2008-11-21T16:48:00.000Z	diffred		no one can help me getting the acrobat reader running on firefox?
2008-11-21T16:48:00.000Z	jrib	diffred	did you install it?
2008-11-21T16:49:00.000Z	jrib	diffred	you probably want mozilla-acroread
2008-11-21T16:49:00.000Z	diffred	jrib	yea would install it :)
2009-02-03T00:06:00.000Z	jrib	diffred	links2, epiphany?
2009-02-04T18:05:00.000Z	jrib	diffred	usually, I add "linux" as a search term when that happens
2009-02-04T18:05:00.000Z	diffred	jrib	thanks gonna try!
2009-02-04T18:06:00.000Z	jrib	diffred	you might be able to use "convert" from imagemagick too, but I've never tried
2009-02-04T18:08:00.000Z	jrib	diffred	and apparently, you can just use gimp too
2009-03-06T16:54:00.000Z	jrib	diffred	there's a ppa with python 2.6 if you just want the interpreter to play with
2009-03-06T16:54:00.000Z	diffred	jrib	so I cannot install it in an easy way? (don't know what ppa is sorry)
2009-03-06T16:55:00.000Z	jrib	diffred	ppa is a repository (this is the easy way; you add a repository and install the package)
2009-03-06T16:55:00.000Z	diffred	jrib	oh thanks it's like adding a line in the Sources of synaptic?
2009-03-06T16:56:00.000Z	jrib	diffred	yes
2009-03-06T16:56:00.000Z	diffred	jrib	thanks so much! how can I google for that line?
2009-03-06T16:56:00.000Z	jrib	diffred	"python 2.6 ppa", second hit, last comment
2009-07-03T00:35:00.000Z	jrib	diffred	do you happen to use zsh...?
2009-07-03T00:35:00.000Z	diffred	jrib	nope
2009-07-03T00:35:00.000Z	jrib	diffred	then use find
