2005-05-14T07:02:00.000Z	squareff		i partially downloaded an iso file and it seems to be broken. rsync wants to completely redownload it, which i can't easily accept (i am on a slow connection)... so do you know any application which could fix the partial file and resume downloading? or can rsync do this?
2005-05-14T07:04:00.000Z	squareff		how can a md5 checksum help on a partial file?
2005-05-14T07:04:00.000Z	thoreauputic	squareff	wget -c <URL> migh work
2005-05-14T07:06:00.000Z	thoreauputic	squareff	it's the flag for resuming a download
2005-05-14T07:10:00.000Z	thoreauputic	squareff	a linux install without wget is like a woman without kisses *grin*
2005-05-14T07:10:00.000Z	squareff	thoreauputic	i thought curl was enough. do you think i whould use wget instead of curl?
2005-05-14T07:11:00.000Z	thoreauputic	squareff	use both as appropriate
2005-05-14T07:12:00.000Z	squareff	thoreauputic	are both really necessary? can't i just use one?
2005-05-14T07:12:00.000Z	thoreauputic	squareff	do as you wish...
2005-05-14T07:13:00.000Z	thoreauputic	squareff	some apps use wget or curl as a backend
2005-05-14T07:13:00.000Z	squareff	thoreauputic	i noticed that, this is why i kept curl
2005-05-14T07:13:00.000Z	thoreauputic	squareff	both are tiny anyway
2005-05-14T07:14:00.000Z	thoreauputic	squareff	umm.. how big is your hard drive? And how many videos and large music files do you have? better remove those as well </joke>
2005-05-14T07:15:00.000Z	squareff	thoreauputic	on this computer i only have 4 GB
2005-05-14T07:16:00.000Z	thoreauputic	squareff	you didn't answer my other questions - start with your pr0n stash ;-)
2005-05-14T07:16:00.000Z	squareff	thoreauputic	i thought my 4 GB hdd was enough of an answer
2005-05-14T07:18:00.000Z	thoreauputic	squareff	my old P200 has only 2gig, and it has curl and wgwt installed :)
2005-05-14T07:18:00.000Z	squareff	thoreauputic	yeah... i was going to install wget anyway... so... stop persuading me! :))
2005-05-14T07:20:00.000Z	thoreauputic	squareff	I'm not trying to persuade you - you can use telnet and a punchcard system as far as I'm concerned - OH BTW don't forget to uninstall Emacs if you have it ;-)
