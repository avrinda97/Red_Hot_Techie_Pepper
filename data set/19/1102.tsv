2011-06-03T06:47:00.000Z	gskellig		how does it hang?
2011-06-03T06:47:00.000Z	gskellig		I get a mouse and ubuntu loading screen but nothing else happens I can't even ctrl+alt+F1 to get terminal
2011-06-03T06:48:00.000Z	gskellig		dual gpu laptop. but the nvidia one is turned off
2011-06-03T06:48:00.000Z	gskellig		the intel GMA is under unity supported devices, and i've gotten it to run unity in the past
2011-06-03T06:49:00.000Z	gskellig		by default it is, I have actually turned it off
2011-06-03T06:49:00.000Z	gskellig		it doesn't come up in "lshw -C video"
2011-06-03T06:49:00.000Z	gskellig		it did before I turned it off. I found a modprobe online
2011-06-03T06:50:00.000Z	gskellig		turns it off completely
2011-06-03T06:50:00.000Z	gskellig		it's specifically for the asus UL series of laptops, I can link you if you want roothorick
2011-06-03T06:50:00.000Z	Ericthegreat	gskellig	we got same prob
2011-06-03T06:51:00.000Z	gskellig	Ericthegreat	do you have any intention of using your ATI card? Or do you only want to use the intel one
2011-06-03T07:28:00.000Z	gskellig	Ericthegreat	fix your problem?
2011-06-03T08:12:00.000Z	gskellig	Ericthegreat	what happens if you type glxinfo
2011-06-03T08:18:00.000Z	gskellig	Ericthegreat	apt-get install xbase-clients
2011-06-03T08:20:00.000Z	gskellig	Ericthegreat	i did indeed.
2011-06-03T08:28:00.000Z	gskellig	Ericthegreat	see if you can somehow disable your ati graphics card. Google guides for your specific laptop. I have no idea how, I Found a modprobe module for my laptop.
2011-06-03T08:29:00.000Z	gskellig	Ericthegreat	also see if you can forcibly remove the radeon drivers
2011-06-03T08:36:00.000Z	gskellig	Ericthegreat	after you do that you have to copy the new xorg.conf and replace the old one, I've gotta go. Good luck!
