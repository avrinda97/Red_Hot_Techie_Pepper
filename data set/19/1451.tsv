2011-01-24T19:08:00.000Z	amh345		hello?
2011-01-24T19:10:00.000Z	amh345		the other docs i see all show how i can setup wireless using gnome. but i have  only commandline.
2011-01-24T19:11:00.000Z	shcherbak	amh345	man iwconfig, man iwlist, do you have driver already working?
2011-01-24T19:11:00.000Z	amh345	shcherbak	^^
2011-01-24T19:12:00.000Z	shcherbak	amh345	iwconfig , txpower not 0
2011-01-24T19:13:00.000Z	amh345	shcherbak	iwconfig txpower shows 14 dBm
2011-01-24T19:14:00.000Z	shcherbak	amh345	is WEP WPA open network?
2011-01-24T19:14:00.000Z	amh345	shcherbak	no, it's not an open connection
2011-01-24T19:15:00.000Z	amh345	shcherbak	it's wpa2 personal
2011-01-24T19:16:00.000Z	shcherbak	amh345	You need to know wpa_supplicant, hm WPA2, do not recall perfect solution...
2011-01-24T19:17:00.000Z	shcherbak	amh345	anyway to confirm your wireless works: iwlist wlan0 scanning
2011-01-24T19:18:00.000Z	amh345	shcherbak	that returns a result.    i found my essid.  now im trying to iwconfig wlan0 key my_key_here but it's throwing an invalid arg on my_key_here
2011-01-24T19:20:00.000Z	shcherbak	amh345	You need wpa_supplicant to connect (and there is plenty on almost good how-tos, it may be that you will need wicd)
2011-01-24T20:01:00.000Z	shcherbak	amh345	Do you have ip? dhclient
2011-03-09T04:12:00.000Z	shcherbak	amh345	scp? Depense which side and are you behind router.
2011-03-09T04:20:00.000Z	shcherbak	amh345	are you - from local machine: scp <local file> remote.host:/path/to/new/file/ if not how you do it?
