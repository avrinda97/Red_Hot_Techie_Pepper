2006-05-19T16:55:00.000Z	livingdaylight		anyone running from chat from Opera?
2006-05-19T16:55:00.000Z	rambo3	livingdaylight	sometimes
2006-05-19T16:55:00.000Z	livingdaylight	rambo3	its quite different isn't it, first time here
2006-05-19T16:56:00.000Z	livingdaylight	rambo3	i like opera, but downloading and opening music or vid files i always end up in trouble. I find Firefox much easier in that respect
2006-05-19T16:57:00.000Z	livingdaylight	rambo3	is it a matter of configuring opera or is it just not as easy in Linux with opera?
2006-05-19T16:57:00.000Z	rambo3	livingdaylight	yes , making opera do those things is alot of work
2006-05-19T16:58:00.000Z	livingdaylight	rambo3	so, presumably its only alot of work running it with Linux. I want to be able to click on something and my default players automatically open up etc, you know what i mean?
2006-05-19T16:58:00.000Z	rambo3	livingdaylight	its an linux matter
2006-05-19T16:59:00.000Z	rambo3	livingdaylight	no i dont know how to set it up , i just fixed java in opera . i coulden't get vidios to play
2006-05-19T16:59:00.000Z	livingdaylight	rambo3	ahhh....exactly, forgot all about that...that is another problem i have had with opera. How did you fix that. Tell me only if it is easy?
2006-05-19T05:00:00.000Z	livingdaylight	rambo3	vids are one of the things that don't open. No point using opera and then having ot flip over to firefox when i want to open a video or music file
2006-05-19T05:01:00.000Z	livingdaylight	rambo3	is there a more appropriate chat room that handles these Opera/LInux issues?
2006-05-19T05:01:00.000Z	livingdaylight	rambo3	what wiki? or where?
2006-05-19T05:02:00.000Z	livingdaylight	rambo3	ok, thx
