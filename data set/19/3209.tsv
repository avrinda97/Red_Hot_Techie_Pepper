2011-05-17T05:14:00.000Z	pfifo	WinCamXP	you should be fine
2011-05-17T05:15:00.000Z	pfifo	WinCamXP	use ssh, you DONT want x11 on  a server
2011-05-17T05:32:00.000Z	pfifo	WinCamXP	you will be fine, if it can run XP it can run 10X ubuntu-server

2011-05-17T05:45:00.000Z	pfifo	WinCamXP	it will run it with 256 and some swap, but it will be a bit laggy
