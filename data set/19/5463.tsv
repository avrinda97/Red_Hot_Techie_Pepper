2008-09-12T03:42:00.000Z	bluefox83		i need some help sshing to my box at home (yes it has openssh installed, and yes it's listed in dmz on the router) i need help setting ssh up to actually connect to it
2008-09-12T03:43:00.000Z	fozilla	bluefox83	what are the problems connecting?
2008-09-12T03:44:00.000Z	bluefox83	fozilla	times out...all i know how to do is use the network ip, how do i direct it on to the machine i want? (192.168.1.5)
2008-09-12T03:45:00.000Z	fozilla	bluefox83	ar you trying to connect to that ip from outside your home network?
2008-09-12T03:46:00.000Z	bluefox83	fozilla	yeah i'm at work
2008-09-12T03:47:00.000Z	fozilla	bluefox83	you need to connect using the external ip, and have your router configured to forward that to the internal ip
2008-09-12T03:47:00.000Z	bluefox83	fozilla	but...that doesn't work either...
2008-09-12T03:47:00.000Z	fozilla	bluefox83	can you connect from another box on your lan?
2008-09-12T03:48:00.000Z	bluefox83	fozilla	it's on the dmz list of my router...shouldn't that be enough?
2008-09-12T03:48:00.000Z	bluefox83	fozilla	yeah
2008-09-12T03:49:00.000Z	fozilla	bluefox83	it might be trying to do a reverse dns lookup, then timing out...
2008-09-12T03:50:00.000Z	bluefox83	fozilla	if i just did: ssh <WAN ip> would that work?
2008-09-12T03:52:00.000Z	fozilla	bluefox83	yeah, add your username though  user@ipaddress
2008-09-12T03:53:00.000Z	bluefox83	fozilla	it just sits and blinks at me in terminal...any ideas?
2008-09-12T03:54:00.000Z	fozilla	bluefox83	there might be some ssh configs you could change, your work might block port 22, you might need to change router settings
2008-09-12T03:55:00.000Z	bluefox83	fozilla	i doubt it, i work at a college >.>
2008-09-12T03:55:00.000Z	fozilla	bluefox83	check your logs at home, see if there are any failed attempts or clues there
2008-09-12T03:56:00.000Z	bluefox83	fozilla	aww, bummer...i was hoping to start tinkering with it tonight :/
2008-09-12T03:56:00.000Z	fozilla	bluefox83	can you ping your home box?
