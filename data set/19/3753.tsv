2009-07-27T22:51:00.000Z	twig11		How do I remove the default home folder created by a Jaunty install? I set up fstab so ubuntu mounts /home on a different partition, but now how do I access and delete the default /home?
2009-07-27T22:52:00.000Z	DaZ	twig11	umount partition and delete /home ? :f
2009-07-27T22:53:00.000Z	twig11	DaZ	I'm pretty new. can you explain that in more detail?
2009-07-27T22:54:00.000Z	DaZ	twig11	explain what exactly? :f
2009-07-27T22:55:00.000Z	twig11	DaZ	On a previous install, I placed /home on its own partition, sda6. When I reinstalled, I left that partition alone, and after the install I set up fstab to mount sda6 as /home. that's the home folder I'm using now. I'm not sure even how to find the default home directory created during the install.
2009-07-27T22:56:00.000Z	twig11	DaZ	do you understand what I'm doing?
2009-07-27T22:57:00.000Z	DaZ	twig11	default home is hiddem because of partition mounted at /home/
2009-07-27T22:57:00.000Z	DaZ	twig11	unmount it  to see it
2009-07-27T22:58:00.000Z	twig11	DaZ	How do I unmount that partition if it's the home folder I'm using?
2009-07-27T22:58:00.000Z	DaZ	twig11	logout, and log in as root in the terminal
2009-07-27T23:01:00.000Z	DaZ	twig11	sudo passwd root, type password you want, logoud, switch to tty1, login as root and umount /home
2009-07-27T23:02:00.000Z	twig11	DaZ	does it actually matter if the default home directory is there?
2009-07-27T23:03:00.000Z	DaZ	twig11	root uses /root as home directory
2009-07-27T23:03:00.000Z	DaZ	twig11	or you can set up user directory somewhere else with usermod
2009-07-27T23:03:00.000Z	DaZ	twig11	or just remove /home partition from fstab
2009-07-27T23:06:00.000Z	twig11	DaZ	fosco__: thanks for the suggestions. Unfortunately I have to be careful about thinking on my own. I'm pretty new to linux, and the computer's used by non-tech-savvy people who don't have much patience if I've broken the system and they want to check their email. Know what I mean?
2009-07-27T23:06:00.000Z	twig11	DaZ	I think I'll leave things as they are if it won't make future problems.
2009-07-27T23:06:00.000Z	DaZ	twig11	it won't make any problems
2009-07-27T23:07:00.000Z	twig11	DaZ	okay, thanks.
