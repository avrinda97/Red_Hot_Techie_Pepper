2006-12-12T14:34:00.000Z	paolo	owh	I have to deny kde access for a particular user
2006-12-12T14:35:00.000Z	owh	paolo	Ok, lemmie google for a bit.
2006-12-12T14:37:00.000Z	owh	paolo	Which login manager are you using?
2006-12-12T14:38:00.000Z	paolo	owh	kdm
2006-12-12T14:40:00.000Z	paolo	owh	your idea is good: i have to configure kdm, right?
2006-12-12T14:42:00.000Z	owh	paolo	http://lists.kde.org/?l=kde-kiosk&m=111945708505592&w=2 and http://lists.kde.org/?l=kde-kiosk&m=111946860825069&w=2 give some indication on how this might work. I googled for force kdm sessions
2006-12-12T15:05:00.000Z	paolo	owh	i really can't find it: it seems kdmrc, isn't it?
2006-12-12T15:05:00.000Z	owh	paolo	Lemmie look for you :-)
2006-12-12T15:09:00.000Z	owh	paolo	Hmm, that document restricts options, not what we want. Lemmie google some more :-)
2006-12-12T15:10:00.000Z	paolo	owh	your links are obscure
2006-12-12T15:11:00.000Z	paolo	owh	anyway, the idea could be good
2006-12-12T15:11:00.000Z	owh	paolo	No, they do something else :-)
2006-12-12T15:18:00.000Z	owh	paolo	Hmm, this is interesting: http://www.jirka.org/gdm-documentation/x241.html, scroll to the end and look at "Per User Configuration"
2006-12-12T15:21:00.000Z	owh	paolo	Create a file in the user's directory, called .dmrc and put this in it:
2006-12-12T15:22:00.000Z	owh	paolo	Although, you'll change "default" to something else :-)
2006-12-12T15:22:00.000Z	owh	paolo	And likely the language string isn't going to be Australian :-)
2006-12-12T15:23:00.000Z	paolo	owh	I already have a dmrc file
2006-12-12T15:24:00.000Z	owh	paolo	And what's in it?
2006-12-12T15:25:00.000Z	owh	paolo	So, change the 'default' to the session type you want.
