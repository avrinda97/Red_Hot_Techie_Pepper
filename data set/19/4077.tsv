2009-09-13T10:23:00.000Z	sub[t]rnl		No, you can remove 3.0
2009-09-13T10:24:00.000Z	sub[t]rnl		I don't have it installed, and have not ran into any problems
2009-09-13T10:25:00.000Z	micahg	sub[t]rnl	you're not running the ubuntu version then
2009-09-13T10:21:00.000Z	micahg	sub[t]rnl	ff3.5 is in Jaunty
2009-09-13T10:22:00.000Z	sub[t]rnl	micahg	i know, I'm using 3.5.3
2009-09-13T10:23:00.000Z	micahg	sub[t]rnl	that's not correct
2009-09-13T10:24:00.000Z	micahg	sub[t]rnl	the search engines are provided by 3.0 in januty
2009-09-13T10:24:00.000Z	sub[t]rnl	micahg	I apt-get removed firefox and installed 3.5.3 from source
2009-09-13T10:25:00.000Z	micahg	sub[t]rnl	what source?
2009-09-13T10:25:00.000Z	sub[t]rnl	micahg	a tar.gz, from the mozzilla website
2009-09-13T10:26:00.000Z	sub[t]rnl	micahg	It's a non issue really, firefox updates itself with security patches, so you really don't have to rely on the repo's for a stand-alone browser like firefox.
2009-09-13T10:26:00.000Z	micahg	sub[t]rnl	yes, but that can cause problems for some users
2009-09-13T10:28:00.000Z	sub[t]rnl	micahg	 No problems at all here.
2009-09-13T10:33:00.000Z	sub[t]rnl	micahg	ahh, i see from the link why you were saying it's dangerous... lol
2009-09-13T10:33:00.000Z	sub[t]rnl	micahg	I'm not running 3.5 "alongside" 3.0
2009-09-13T10:34:00.000Z	micahg	sub[t]rnl	right, because you are using the upstream version
2009-09-13T10:34:00.000Z	sub[t]rnl	micahg	What I got from reading the warning was having both 3.0 and 3.5 at the same time sharing a profile
2009-09-13T10:34:00.000Z	sub[t]rnl	micahg	I've purged 3.0 and am running 3.5.3 by itself.
2009-09-13T10:34:00.000Z	micahg	sub[t]rnl	that's one problen
