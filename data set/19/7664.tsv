2007-08-01T07:54:00.000Z	dragon_		Is anyone running 2 graphics cards?
2007-08-01T07:55:00.000Z	AmiDaniel_away	dragon_	Why would you need to?
2007-08-01T07:55:00.000Z	AmiDaniel_away		Nothing gets along well with more than one graphics card
2007-08-01T07:55:00.000Z	dragon_	AmiDaniel_away	3 monitors
2007-08-01T07:55:00.000Z	AmiDaniel_away		Oh, yikes :)
2007-08-01T07:55:00.000Z	AmiDaniel_away		Never tried it before, actually
2007-08-01T07:56:00.000Z	AmiDaniel_away	dragon_	What's the trouble you're having?
2007-08-01T07:56:00.000Z	dragon_		I can only get the 2 monitors on the first graphics card to work. the second card and third monitor stay blank
2007-08-01T07:57:00.000Z	AmiDaniel_away	dragon_	What's the chipset? nvidia?
2007-08-01T07:57:00.000Z	dragon_		Radeon X1300 both. PCI-E
2007-08-01T07:59:00.000Z	AmiDaniel_away	dragon_	Hmm ... I do not know. Most I can find about anything is running dual monitors, i.e., http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=221174
2007-08-01T07:59:00.000Z	AmiDaniel_away		Never tried to run 3
2007-08-01T08:00:00.000Z	AmiDaniel_away		And I don't think anyone makes a card with 3 dvis ... have seen em with svideo and 2 dvis
2007-08-01T08:01:00.000Z	dragon_	AmiDaniel_away	I tried that how-to and even with 2 cards 2 monitors the second card still refuses to run
2007-08-01T08:02:00.000Z	AmiDaniel_away	dragon_	Are both cards powering on? Is Ubuntu recognizing the card? (check the system monitor)
2007-08-01T08:02:00.000Z	dragon_		Yes, and lspci shows the card as well
2007-08-01T08:03:00.000Z	AmiDaniel_away	dragon_	I'm going to guess you'll have to edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf yourself .. don't see anything xserver config that would pertain to this
2007-08-01T08:03:00.000Z	dragon_	AmiDaniel_away	Did that:(
2007-08-01T08:04:00.000Z	AmiDaniel_away	dragon_	What'd you do exactly? :)
