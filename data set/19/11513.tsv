2006-01-11T16:36:00.000Z	Despen		Where can I find help so I can install scummVM 0.80?
2006-01-11T07:55:00.000Z	Despen		Can someone help? I want to install ScummVm 0.8.. but I have problems with dependeces.
2006-01-11T07:55:00.000Z	kameron	Despen	try installing with apt-get, it's a dependency solver.
2006-01-11T07:59:00.000Z	Despen	kameron	But I can only find version 0.71 if I use apt-get
2006-01-11T08:00:00.000Z	kameron	Despen	apt-get install it, it will isntall all dependencies, then uninstall the package, and install the recent one! it's one way of doing things. assuming the dependencies between versions is the same.
2006-01-11T08:02:00.000Z	Despen	kameron	Ah, ok.. thanks
2006-01-11T08:09:00.000Z	Despen	kameron	Still problems... scummVM 0.80 wants libflac6, I have libflac7 installed..
2006-01-11T08:10:00.000Z	kameron	Despen	haha... that sucks. hmm. i'll have a look for you.
2006-01-11T08:13:00.000Z	Despen	kameron	Thanks again...
2006-01-11T08:17:00.000Z	kameron	Despen	libflac6 isn't in repositories. you sure it won't work with 7
2006-01-11T08:35:00.000Z	Despen	kameron	It might work with libflac7.. But How od I reconfigure so it tries to use libfalc7 instead of libflac6?
2006-01-11T08:36:00.000Z	Despen	kameron	ScummVM 0.80
2006-01-11T08:45:00.000Z	kameron	Despen	i just thought of a new idea. you can make a symbolic link to libflac7 from libflac6
2006-01-11T08:48:00.000Z	kameron	Despen	i don't know if you got what i said, there was a bit of a flood.. scroll up
2006-01-11T09:07:00.000Z	Despen	kameron	Ok, I'll try that
2006-01-11T09:13:00.000Z	Despen	kameron	Thanks, got it to work!!
2006-01-11T09:14:00.000Z	kameron	Despen	:D good!! i wasn't sure if that was going to work, but worth a shot. symbolic links are awesome.
2006-01-11T09:18:00.000Z	Despen	kameron	Yes, It seems to work.. it started at least
2006-01-11T09:19:00.000Z	kameron	Despen	sounds like a good start at least :P\
