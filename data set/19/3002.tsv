2009-11-29T22:07:00.000Z	gp5st		so, i'm trying to install ubuntu on my netbook: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStick
2009-11-29T22:07:00.000Z	gp5st		but i can't get it to boot from the sd card
2009-11-29T22:09:00.000Z	gp5st		any ideas?
2009-11-29T22:11:00.000Z	mka	gp5st	you have GRUB on an SD card?
2009-11-29T22:13:00.000Z	gp5st	mka	that's not part of the directions, no it doesn't have grub, i assumed it was part of the image
2009-11-29T22:13:00.000Z	mka	gp5st	what is on the SD card then?
2009-11-29T22:15:00.000Z	mka	gp5st	last time I did this was unsuccessful but that was 5 years ago. anyway did you try to get your BIOS to boot from your sd card?
2009-11-29T22:16:00.000Z	gp5st	mka	no, it just boots into windows
2009-11-29T22:17:00.000Z	gp5st	mka	when i plug the drive into my mac it says it's a fat32 fs labeld ubuntu-netbook remix
2009-11-29T22:18:00.000Z	mka	gp5st	sorry
2009-11-29T22:18:00.000Z	gp5st	mka	no problems; better to take something that works but isn't what i was looking for than to waste mine and other people's time
2009-11-29T22:19:00.000Z	mka	gp5st	you dont have a CD?
2009-11-29T22:19:00.000Z	gp5st	mka	netbooks don't have cd drives
2009-11-29T22:20:00.000Z	mka	gp5st	what do you use now for internet?
2009-11-29T22:21:00.000Z	gp5st	mka	wifi from dsl, why?
2009-11-29T22:21:00.000Z	mka	gp5st	I meant to ask which OS are you using now
2009-11-29T22:24:00.000Z	gp5st	mka	mac os on my laptop, windows is on the netbook
2009-11-29T22:25:00.000Z	mka	gp5st	I was gonna say try System -> Administration -> USB Startup Disk Creation
2009-11-29T22:26:00.000Z	gp5st	mka	i have a vm i could try that
