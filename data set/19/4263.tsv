2009-02-19T07:23:00.000Z	ibuclaw	Sal__	you could have a look here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=541656
2009-02-19T07:23:00.000Z	ibuclaw	Sal__	that is for "Remote Desktop in Firefox" though. But the same principles apply
2009-02-19T07:30:00.000Z	ibuclaw	Sal__	have you setup the desktop configuration ?
2009-02-19T07:31:00.000Z	Sal__	ibuclaw	was there anything additional that i needed to setup?
2009-02-19T07:31:00.000Z	ibuclaw	Sal__	gedit ~/.vnc/xstartup
2009-02-19T07:31:00.000Z	ibuclaw	Sal__	are you using Gnome, KDE or XFCE?
2009-02-19T07:33:00.000Z	ibuclaw	Sal__	this is just an example. But if the gnome-desktop package is installed on your server, you'd have something like this: http://paste.ubuntu.com/119897/plain/
2009-02-19T07:34:00.000Z	Sal__	ibuclaw	http://pastebin.com/d6dbf1675
2009-02-19T07:36:00.000Z	Sal__	ibuclaw	even if i change to your settings and restart the vnc server, same issue occurs :l
2009-02-19T07:39:00.000Z	ibuclaw	Sal__	are you still here?
2009-02-19T17:14:00.000Z	ibuclaw	Sal__	did you get everything sorted in the end?
