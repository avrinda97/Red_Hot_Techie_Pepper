2007-02-17T07:46:00.000Z	jonathan__		im trying to convert a wma file in audacity where would i find the libmp3lame.so
2007-02-17T07:46:00.000Z	jonathan__		where do i find that
2007-02-17T07:47:00.000Z	jonathan__		?
2007-02-17T07:47:00.000Z	jonathan__		audacity sais that it uses lame to encode in mpe
2007-02-17T07:47:00.000Z	jonathan__		and this is  audacity
2007-02-17T07:47:00.000Z	jonathan__		what is the best way to convert it
2007-02-17T07:48:00.000Z	jonathan__		i tried soundkonverter i keep getting an error
2007-02-17T07:49:00.000Z	jonathan__		is it worth the quality loss crimsun
2007-02-17T07:49:00.000Z	LjL	jonathan__	imho, not. converting a lossy audio format into another lossy one, for storage, is never a good idea.
2007-02-17T07:51:00.000Z	LjL	jonathan__	and the question is, why? you lose quality, you get a bigger file, and mp3 is patented too
2007-02-17T07:52:00.000Z	LjL	jonathan__	if you feel you have to convert your lossily compressed files into something else, FLAC is probably the least of your evils.
2007-02-17T07:52:00.000Z	LjL	jonathan__	who's saying you should convert them in the first place?
2007-02-17T07:53:00.000Z	LjL	jonathan__	of course, FLAC is lossless -- that means files will be an order of magnitude bigger than MP3, WMA or Vorbis
2007-02-17T07:53:00.000Z	LjL	jonathan__	rip them again. converting lossy->lossy is simply a stupid idea
2007-02-17T07:53:00.000Z	LjL	jonathan__	i don't know if it's "worth" it. i know you won't lose quality
2007-02-17T08:09:00.000Z	LjL	jonathan__	don't know, if i had to convert audio i'd probably just pipe a decoder into an encoder
2007-11-03T00:40:00.000Z	LjL	jonathan__	no. there is just here.
2008-10-17T23:31:00.000Z	LjL	jonathan__	yes
