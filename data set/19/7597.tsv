2007-07-27T13:46:00.000Z	vindbo		Please, I am in dire need of help! I plead you, anyone who can help me, please do so!      I am trying to export mails from Outlook 2003 to Ubuntu Evolution (Feisty) Please, I have been working for 5.5 hours now, and I am running out of ideas, and getting quite upset and desperate
2007-07-27T13:47:00.000Z	Edgan	vindbo	You best bet would be to just upload them to a imap server, and then either use imap from now on, or move them from the imap server to local. This would be easier and faster with a local imap server.
2007-07-27T13:50:00.000Z	vindbo	Edgan	I don't know how to set up an IMAP account, and I have 600 mb worth of emails that needs to be exported. Do you have any other ideas?     frost0: Thank you, but I have tried this guide. it didn't work for me. I followed every little step of it, but no mails are to be found in either Thunderbird for ubuntu or Evolution. Please, I don't know what to do, and I'm feeling so helpless
2007-07-27T13:51:00.000Z	Edgan	vindbo	600mb is nothing with a local imap server
2007-07-27T13:52:00.000Z	Edgan	vindbo	install dovecot, create a user, set a password, make sure firewall/iptables isn't blocking 143, set your outlook to use the ip address/hostname of the linux box as the imap server
2007-07-27T13:55:00.000Z	Edgan	vindbo	You will need to run Outlook on a Windows machine. Unless you want to use Crossover Office, VMware, Wine, or something else like that.
2007-07-27T14:02:00.000Z	vindbo	Edgan	frost0 I am running outlook 2003 on a win xp machine. I exported the emails from outlook 2003 to thunderbird for windows sucessfully. From there I copied the "local folder.sbd" file to my usb stick. plugged it into my ubuntu box, then copied the local folder.sbd to /home/vindbo/.thunderbird/ without any emails showing up in thunderbird for linux. I tried to copy them to /home/vindbo/.evolution/mail/local/ as well, but no emails. I don'
2007-07-27T14:02:00.000Z	Edgan	vindbo	If you still have them in outlook 2003, just use my method
2007-07-27T14:04:00.000Z	vindbo	Edgan	frost0 Yes I still have the emails in Outlook 2003
2007-07-27T14:04:00.000Z	Edgan	vindbo	install dovecot, create a user, set a password, make sure firewall/iptables isn't blocking 143, set your outlook to use the ip address/hostname of the linux box as the imap server

2007-07-27T14:09:00.000Z	vindbo	Edgan	frost0: should I perform a sudo apt-get install dovecot-common  ?

2007-07-27T15:40:00.000Z	Edgan	vindbo	Get it to work?
2007-07-27T15:41:00.000Z	vindbo	Edgan	hey! I'm trying to get Outport to work. Right now I am performing a cp -r /media/MEMORYSTICK__/outport/inbox/* /home/vindbo/.evolution/mail/local/*
2007-07-27T15:42:00.000Z	vindbo	Edgan	this should work, right?
2007-07-27T15:43:00.000Z	Edgan	vindbo	are the files in outport/inbox in mbox format?
2007-07-27T15:44:00.000Z	vindbo	Edgan	I don't know. looking at them from nautilus, they look like regular folders and html-files
2007-07-27T15:47:00.000Z	vindbo	Edgan	ohh, man! It didn't work. Now the sidebar in Evolution is full of the names of the mails, and when i try accessing them (from the sidebar, not the main view) i get an error saying permission denied. How do I undo a terminal command like this?
