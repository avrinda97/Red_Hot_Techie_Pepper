2012-11-22T05:58:00.000Z	extropy		my update installer app always opens up in a screen that doesn't exist
2012-11-22T05:59:00.000Z	extropy		how I do I make it open on the correct output?
2012-11-22T05:59:00.000Z	extropy		like it's open but there's not window
2012-11-22T06:00:00.000Z	extropy		like it's in the memory location of my HDMI port where no display is connected instead of my VGA
2012-11-22T06:00:00.000Z	extropy		ubuntu also doesn't recognize my monitor and won't let me use it's native resolution which is equally frustrating
2012-11-22T06:01:00.000Z	Isaban	extropy	you can force it to use a resolution
2012-11-22T06:01:00.000Z	extropy	Isaban	can I force the update install to open on a display that actually exists instead of "invisible land"?
2012-11-22T06:02:00.000Z	Isaban	extropy	use apt-get
2012-11-22T06:02:00.000Z	extropy	Isaban	use apt-get for what? uninstall/reinstall the update manager?
2012-11-22T06:03:00.000Z	Isaban	extropy	naw, use apt-get to update
2012-11-22T06:03:00.000Z	Isaban	extropy	then you can at least have updated
2012-11-22T06:03:00.000Z	extropy	Isaban	I can isntall updates just using the update manager's icon ... it just never shows me a window for the application
2012-11-22T06:05:00.000Z	Isaban	extropy	did you ever have a second monitor connected?
2012-11-22T06:06:00.000Z	extropy	Isaban	I did at one point connect an HDMI display when I had one but no longer have access to an HDMI device
2012-11-22T06:06:00.000Z	Isaban	extropy	that's the problem
2012-11-22T06:07:00.000Z	extropy	Isaban	why does it try to open it on a device that it should know is no longer connected. Also, why is it that when I close the update manager and re-open it the window comes up on my connect screen but when it automatically launches itself it opens up on the screen that doesn't exist?
2012-11-22T06:11:00.000Z	Isaban	extropy	that's cause support has not been added
2012-11-22T06:12:00.000Z	extropy	Isaban	as someone who owns the hardware and could test future efforts to support it is there anything I can do to move the process along? I'm not exactly a kernel hacker, driver-guru
2012-11-22T06:13:00.000Z	Isaban	extropy	best way is to look at crash logs and submit them
