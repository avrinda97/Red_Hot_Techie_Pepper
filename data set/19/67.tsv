2012-10-20T20:47:00.000Z	Griffin40		Hello
2012-10-20T20:49:00.000Z	Griffin40		Excuse me I have a question, I recently installed some updates through the update manager on 12.04 but now my pc boots into tty1 instead of a gui. What should I do?
2012-10-20T20:49:00.000Z	Optichip	Griffin40	were you using proprietary video drivers?
2012-10-20T20:50:00.000Z	Griffin40	Optichip	I was using a driver I downloaded from AMD
2012-10-20T20:50:00.000Z	Optichip	Griffin40	you'll need to rerun your amd configuration then
2012-10-20T20:51:00.000Z	Griffin40	Optichip	How could I do that from tty1
2012-10-20T20:52:00.000Z	Optichip	Griffin40	just login as yourself, find the driver file you downloaded from AMD and rerun it
2012-10-20T20:53:00.000Z	Griffin40	Optichip	The problem is I can not get into a gui I can only boot into tty1
2012-10-20T20:54:00.000Z	Optichip	Griffin40	you don't need to get to the GUI to cd to the Downloads directory and run the file ./AMDblahblah.bin
2012-10-20T20:55:00.000Z	Griffin40	Optichip	I do not know the file name
2012-10-20T20:57:00.000Z	Optichip	Griffin40	if you downloaded it, then it should be in your Downloads folder, will start with amd or AMD.
2012-10-20T20:58:00.000Z	Griffin40	Optichip	I think it is something really long and funny
2012-10-20T20:58:00.000Z	Optichip	Griffin40	you can type the first few letters of the filename then hit [TAB] key to complete.
2012-10-20T20:58:00.000Z	Griffin40	Optichip	I don't think it is the graphics card though because all the graphics are working fine it is just booting up normally then going into tty1
2012-10-20T20:59:00.000Z	Optichip	Griffin40	then you can check /var/log/Xorg.0.log and see if there's any error message
2012-10-20T21:13:00.000Z	Optichip	Griffin40	did you try to do a    sudo dpkg-reconfigure lightdm
2012-10-20T21:14:00.000Z	Griffin40	Optichip	Yes I think i did
2012-10-20T21:15:00.000Z	Griffin40	Optichip	If I type that nothing happens
