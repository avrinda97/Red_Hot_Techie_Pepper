2006-08-12T05:08:00.000Z	Flannel	OneTruth	but, it's configurable
2006-08-12T05:14:00.000Z	Flannel	OneTruth	which directory?
2006-08-12T05:15:00.000Z	OneTruth	Flannel	 a Wiki web directory
2006-08-12T05:15:00.000Z	OneTruth	Flannel	call twiki in my www folder
2006-08-12T05:15:00.000Z	Flannel	OneTruth	er, if it's in www, you could just chmod it so www-data could see it.  Either by adding www-data to the group, or just chmod 775 or whatnot
2006-08-12T05:16:00.000Z	OneTruth	Flannel	how do I add www-data to the group?
2006-08-12T05:17:00.000Z	Flannel	OneTruth	you'd set the group as www-data, via chown
2006-08-12T05:17:00.000Z	OneTruth	Flannel	ok, and then after installation i need to make some files inaccessible by everyone, how would I do that?
2006-08-12T05:19:00.000Z	Flannel	OneTruth	by everyone?  is this from the computer? or from the web?
2006-08-12T05:19:00.000Z	OneTruth	Flannel	 web
2006-08-12T05:19:00.000Z	Flannel	OneTruth	you'd do that... via web stuff, htaccess or whatnot.
2006-08-12T05:19:00.000Z	OneTruth	Flannel	I just did: chown -hR www-data:www-data twiki
2006-08-12T05:19:00.000Z	OneTruth	Flannel	 and now permission is denied through the wbe
2006-08-12T05:20:00.000Z	OneTruth	Flannel	 ok
