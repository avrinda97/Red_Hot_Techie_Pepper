2010-04-27T15:48:00.000Z	Klanticus		hello ppl. My machine locked up (kernel panic) while installing some packages, and now apt is broken. How do I fix it?
2010-04-27T15:49:00.000Z	leagris	Klanticus	would copy the messages from apt to pastebin
2010-04-27T15:50:00.000Z	Klanticus	leagris	yes, but all messages are in portuguese. Is there any way to made it display them in english?
2010-04-27T15:51:00.000Z	Klanticus	leagris	here it is: http://paste.ubuntu.com/423301/
2010-04-27T15:52:00.000Z	leagris	Klanticus	setting LANG=C or LANG=en befor apt like this: export LANG=C; sudo apt-get whatevercommand
2010-04-27T15:54:00.000Z	Klanticus	leagris	thank you. Here is the link for the english version http://paste.ubuntu.com/423304/
2010-04-27T15:54:00.000Z	leagris	Klanticus	I use this export LANG=C things very often due to my system being in french :)
2010-04-27T15:54:00.000Z	Klanticus	leagris	very handy
2010-04-27T15:57:00.000Z	leagris	Klanticus	As your system crashed I guess it would be wise to force an fsck on / booting on single user (from the grub menu) only then after that, sudo apt-get install -f usually fix broken installs.
2010-04-27T15:59:00.000Z	Klanticus	leagris	I already fsck'ed, and just tried sudo apt-get install -f, but it failed with a similar error :/
2010-04-27T16:02:00.000Z	leagris	Klanticus	well you did not past the errors yet but, firs things I would do is search the web for the error message in default english (LANG=C). Chances are others went into the same situation and solutions are mentioned somewhere on forums or archived mailing lists.

2010-04-27T16:09:00.000Z	leagris	Klanticus	did you try sudo dpkg --remove --force-remove lvm2
2010-04-27T16:12:00.000Z	leagris	Klanticus	reading your past, it appear the lvm2 package is partially installed and it can't execute the post install scripts. You should not have to break you installation down. There are ways around this removing the offending package ignoring the broken scripts
2010-04-27T16:13:00.000Z	Klanticus	leagris	i didn't undestand. Should I try the dpkg --remove --force, or not?
2010-04-27T16:14:00.000Z	leagris	Klanticus	yes
2010-04-27T16:15:00.000Z	Klanticus	leagris	ok.. I'm trying it now
2010-04-27T16:19:00.000Z	Klanticus	leagris	no lucky yet http://paste.ubuntu.com/423313/
2010-04-27T16:27:00.000Z	leagris	Klanticus	try with --force-remove-reinstreq option (man dpkg) there is a way to uninstall a package ignoring pre and post processing scripts which is blocking/broken here
