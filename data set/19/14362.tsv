2005-05-12T07:24:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB		well you NEED opterons for dual
2005-05-12T07:24:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB		yes
2005-05-12T07:24:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB		they are the same core
2005-05-12T07:24:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB		yeah
2005-05-12T07:25:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB		because dualcore is coming and here to stay
2005-05-12T07:25:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB		and there's a clear upgrade path
2005-05-12T07:26:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB		yeah but the point is, buy the motherboard and a decent cpu
2005-05-12T07:26:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB		then in a year
2005-05-12T07:26:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB		you'll have acheap dualcore
2005-05-12T07:26:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB		amd have specifically stated otherwise
2005-05-12T07:26:00.000Z	jamesh	HrdwrBoB	so the chipsets for desktop athlon64's can handle multiple CPUs?
2005-05-12T07:26:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	jamesh	no you won't
2005-05-12T07:27:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	jamesh	no, dualcore amd64 is not SMP
2005-05-12T07:28:00.000Z	jamesh	HrdwrBoB	I was under the impression that it was traditional SMP -- just that the chips are on the same piece of silicon, and share a frontside bus
2005-05-12T07:28:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	jamesh	not at all, it's quite a lot better than tradional SMP
2005-05-12T07:29:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	jamesh	they do, the memory controller is linked to both cores
2005-05-12T07:29:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	jamesh	which amd can do because the memory controller is on die
2005-05-12T07:30:00.000Z	jamesh	HrdwrBoB	DDR2 is not just a bump in clock speed for DDR.  I'd be surprised (but happy) if the new CPUs support both
2005-05-12T07:31:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	jamesh	unlikely DDR2 is going to get anywhere soon
