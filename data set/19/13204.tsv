2005-05-10T10:42:00.000Z	XplOzIon	geppy	ye
2005-05-10T10:42:00.000Z	geppy	XplOzIon	go install all of the nvidia packages and run the configurator
2005-05-10T10:42:00.000Z	XplOzIon	geppy	i already have em
2005-05-10T10:43:00.000Z	geppy	XplOzIon	did you install them and configure the driver?
2005-05-10T10:43:00.000Z	XplOzIon	geppy	i think so. Let me check
2005-05-10T10:48:00.000Z	XplOzIon	geppy	it gives me same problem, and i have everything i said installed
2005-05-10T10:48:00.000Z	geppy	XplOzIon	Go reboot.
2005-05-10T10:49:00.000Z	XplOzIon	geppy	i just did
2005-05-10T10:49:00.000Z	geppy	XplOzIon	Did you read the wiki stuff?
2005-05-10T10:49:00.000Z	XplOzIon	geppy	i did quake3 +set r_gldriver /usr/lib/libGL.so.1
2005-05-10T10:49:00.000Z	geppy	XplOzIon	I don't see any reason that you could logically have to do that.
2005-05-10T10:50:00.000Z	XplOzIon	geppy	i had to, if not quake would never start
2005-05-10T10:50:00.000Z	geppy	XplOzIon	If that was the logical thing to do, then quake works, right?
2005-05-10T10:50:00.000Z	geppy	XplOzIon	If that fixed it, you don't have a problem.
2005-05-10T10:51:00.000Z	geppy	XplOzIon	If that didn't fix the problem, then I stand by my statement that there's no logical reason to have to do that.
