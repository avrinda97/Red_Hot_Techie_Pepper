2005-12-27T06:37:00.000Z	tyler7039	bipolar	yes
2005-12-27T06:37:00.000Z	bipolar	tyler7039	you need to use the 'cd' command.
2005-12-27T06:38:00.000Z	bipolar	tyler7039	so if you are at a command prompt, you are probbly at somthing like "user@ubuntu:~" right?
2005-12-27T06:38:00.000Z	tyler7039	bipolar	thats what i tried...cuz im familiar with MS-DOS
2005-12-27T06:38:00.000Z	tyler7039	bipolar	just not the ubuntu terminal
2005-12-27T06:38:00.000Z	bipolar	tyler7039	the commands work a little diffrent
2005-12-27T06:38:00.000Z	tyler7039	bipolar	yes...thats what shows up
2005-12-27T06:38:00.000Z	bipolar	tyler7039	use 'cd Desktop'
2005-12-27T06:38:00.000Z	tyler7039	bipolar	Tyler@tyler:
2005-12-27T06:39:00.000Z	bipolar	tyler7039	the first thing you need to know is that the commands a Case Sensitive.
2005-12-27T06:39:00.000Z	bipolar	tyler7039	Desktop is not the same as desktop, DeSkToP, etc...
2005-12-27T06:40:00.000Z	bipolar	tyler7039	also, 'cd' all by itself will return you to your home directory, where you are now
2005-12-27T06:40:00.000Z	tyler7039	bipolar	yeah. thats where i am stuck
2005-12-27T06:41:00.000Z	tyler7039		i am stuck in my home directory and i dont know how to navigate with the command line to run any programs
2005-12-27T06:41:00.000Z	bipolar	tyler7039	your desktop is in '~/Desktop' where ~ means your home directory.
2005-12-27T06:42:00.000Z	bipolar	tyler7039	'cd' will always take you back to your home directory. so will 'cd ~'
