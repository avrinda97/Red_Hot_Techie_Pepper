2008-12-08T20:39:00.000Z	Milos_SD		Is there a way when I update Nvidia drivers from repos, to use them without restarting my PC? I can't just restart X, it complains about kernel modules not  being loaded.
2008-12-08T20:39:00.000Z	ikonia	Milos_SD	why do you want to update them ?
2008-12-08T20:40:00.000Z	Milos_SD	ikonia	I had an update today, from 177.80 to 177.82 :)
2008-12-08T20:40:00.000Z	ikonia	Milos_SD	yes ?
2008-12-08T20:40:00.000Z	ikonia	Milos_SD	that doesn't answer my question, why do you want to update the nvidia drivers
2008-12-08T20:41:00.000Z	ikonia	Milos_SD	that doesn't answer my question, why do you want to update the nvidia drivers
2008-12-08T20:41:00.000Z	Milos_SD	ikonia	becouse it was offered to me from update manager...
2008-12-08T20:41:00.000Z	ikonia	Milos_SD	so you've update then, whats the problem
2008-12-08T20:42:00.000Z	Milos_SD	ikonia	problem is that I needed to reboot my PC if I wanted to use them :)
2008-12-08T20:42:00.000Z	ikonia	Milos_SD	whats the actual problem, you'lve applied the driver package, it will take effect next time you reboot
2008-12-08T20:43:00.000Z	ikonia	Milos_SD	yes thats right, it's a running module so requires a reboot
2008-12-08T20:43:00.000Z	Milos_SD	ikonia	problem is that if I install Nvidia drivers with Nvidia .run script, I can just restart X and it will work... but with drivers from repos it is not enough :)
2008-12-08T20:43:00.000Z	ikonia	Milos_SD	because they are tied into the running kernel version
2008-12-08T20:44:00.000Z	ikonia	Milos_SD	if you didn't want to reboot, don't reboot
2008-12-08T20:44:00.000Z	Milos_SD	ikonia	I know... but I want to be able to use new version of drivers (firefox bug repaired)
2008-12-08T20:44:00.000Z	ikonia	Milos_SD	then either kill X, unload the modules, do a depmod reload the new module, restart X
2008-12-08T20:45:00.000Z	ikonia	Milos_SD	just wait until your next reboot
2008-12-08T20:45:00.000Z	Milos_SD	ikonia	did that... didn't worked... only if it's not "nvidia" name of the module :)
2008-12-08T20:46:00.000Z	ikonia	Milos_SD	it's tied to the running kernel
