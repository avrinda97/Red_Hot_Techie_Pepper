2011-05-13T01:18:00.000Z	soreau	boon	What do you mean by 'enable the gui of ubuntu'? You mean start X?
2011-05-13T01:18:00.000Z	boon	soreau	I mean if metacity crashes and the whole gui gets flat
2011-05-13T01:19:00.000Z	soreau	boon	You'd do DISPLAY=:0 metacity --replace & disown
2011-05-13T01:22:00.000Z	boon	soreau	do you know how to crash metacity?
2011-05-13T01:23:00.000Z	soreau	boon	That's a rather odd question.. do you mean stop it from running?
2011-05-13T01:23:00.000Z	soreau	boon	Are you trying to test it by stopping all wm's from running?
2011-05-13T01:24:00.000Z	boon	soreau	yes I need to crash it so I cant move windows and the start menus become unresponsive
2011-05-13T01:25:00.000Z	boon	soreau	then I switch to another terminal and try your command ( ctrl+alt+F1 )
2011-05-13T01:25:00.000Z	soreau	boon	right
2011-05-13T01:45:00.000Z	boon	soreau	it worked thanks
2011-05-13T01:45:00.000Z	soreau	boon	I figured it would ;)
2011-05-13T01:46:00.000Z	boon	soreau	do you know a smiley that shows a user at the brink of going rampant(mad)?
2011-05-13T01:47:00.000Z	boon	soreau	it is totally unrelated but I really like to know one of those

2011-05-13T01:57:00.000Z	boon	soreau	I can't see the used string for the emoticon in chatzilla
2011-05-13T01:58:00.000Z	soreau	boon	I have no idea about emoticons, sorry
