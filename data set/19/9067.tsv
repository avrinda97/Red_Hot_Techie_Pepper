2008-10-19T09:30:00.000Z	Tann		Hello
2008-10-19T09:30:00.000Z	Tann		I am working on building a computer, and I am wondering how well supported the NVIDIA chipsets are.
2008-10-19T09:31:00.000Z	Tann		How well the NVIDIA chipsets are supported.**
2008-10-19T09:31:00.000Z	rdw200169	Tann	they're supported pretty well
2008-10-19T09:31:00.000Z	Tann	rdw200169	Thanks.,
2008-10-19T09:31:00.000Z	rdw200169	Tann	what do you have?
2008-10-19T09:32:00.000Z	rdw200169	Tann	8.04 just upgraded the nvidia_new driver to 169...
2008-10-19T09:32:00.000Z	rdw200169	Tann	so it should support the newer cards
2008-10-19T09:32:00.000Z	Tann	rdw200169	ok, I was just wondering, because a mother board I am looking at has an NVIDIA chipset
2008-10-19T09:33:00.000Z	rdw200169	Tann	the Nvidia chipsets, compared to AMD, are MUCH better supported
2008-10-19T09:33:00.000Z	rdw200169	Tann	yeah, they're fine
2008-10-19T09:33:00.000Z	rdw200169	Tann	I'm using the Nvidia driver with dual monitors
2008-10-19T09:33:00.000Z	rdw200169	Tann	and I'm not having any major difficulties
2008-10-19T09:34:00.000Z	rdw200169	Tann	with 8.10, there's supposed to be X autoconfiguration, so no more xorg.conf file mangling\
2008-10-19T09:34:00.000Z	Tann	rdw200169	ok. Thanks. I knew the NVIDIA graphics cards were supported, but I mean like the motherboard chipsets.
2008-10-19T09:34:00.000Z	rdw200169	Tann	I'm talking about those too; I've got Nforce4 i think
2008-10-19T09:35:00.000Z	rdw200169	Tann	I've got the network ports working, audio, everything
2008-10-19T09:35:00.000Z	rdw200169	Tann	haven't tried SLI, though
2008-10-19T09:37:00.000Z	rdw200169	Tann	no problem
