2009-01-06T01:36:00.000Z	Jaison		Hello peeps
2009-01-06T01:38:00.000Z	Jaison		noone here I guess?
2009-01-06T01:38:00.000Z	Jaison		noone is answering
2009-01-06T01:39:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Jaison	see, we all met in the channel where we really answer questions, and said "nobody answer his questions"
2009-01-06T01:41:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Jaison	do you have the restricted driver enabled?
2009-01-06T01:42:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Jaison	system/admin/hardware drivers
2009-01-06T01:43:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Jaison	ok, so open a terminal and type "gksudo nvidia-settings"... make the chanes, apply, then "save to configuration file"
2009-01-06T01:45:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Jaison	it should, as long asyou "save to configuration file"
2009-01-06T01:45:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Jaison	yes, sudo is for CLI, if you're running GUI apps, you need gksudo
2009-01-06T01:53:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Jaison	gksudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst    and put a # sign in front of the entries you don't want in your grub menu (i woudln't recommend deleting them)
2009-01-06T01:54:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Jaison	what?.. commenting them out?..of course, its safe ignoring them to.. i just wouldn't recommend deleting them.
2009-01-06T01:55:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Jaison	just put a # sign in front of the "Title" you don't want to appear, then save and exit.
2009-01-06T01:59:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Jaison	in front of the title, yes
2009-01-06T01:59:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Jaison	it should look like this... #Title Ubuntu bla bla bla.. .. then that title will not appear in your grub list
2009-01-06T02:00:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Jaison	just the title
2009-01-06T02:01:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Jaison	note lines 137 and 143   http://paste.ubuntu.com/100570/
