2005-01-17T14:33:00.000Z	Stew2		I want to switch my PCI card out with an AGP card. What are the steps in warty+backports?
2005-01-17T14:35:00.000Z	Stew2		Can anyone point me to a howto on changing a video card in Ubuntu?
2005-01-17T14:37:00.000Z	Stew2		pozac it's a pci card now, i have a 16 meg agp card to install
2005-01-17T14:38:00.000Z	Stew2		Is there a basic howto on changing a video card out on an ubuntu box?
2005-01-17T14:39:00.000Z	Stew2		pozac can I run a video config program for X from a terminal or GNOME and tell it Vesa? then switch the card out?
2005-01-17T14:39:00.000Z	Stew2		pozac I don't know what kind of card i'm installing. Is there an autodetect?
2005-01-17T14:40:00.000Z	trey3	Stew2	dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg is about your best option  (replace xorg with xfree86 if warty)
2005-01-17T14:40:00.000Z	Stew2	trey3	I run that with X shut down?
2005-01-17T14:41:00.000Z	trey3	Stew2	what I just said will ask you whether you want it to try autodetect
2005-01-17T14:41:00.000Z	trey3	Stew2	doesn't really matter... just need to restart to take effect...
2005-01-17T14:42:00.000Z	trey3	Stew2	if you don't know, you're not ready to  :)
2005-01-17T14:42:00.000Z	Stew2	trey3	I've followed the information in the ubuntu wiki. It talks about changing from sarge to hoary.
2005-01-17T14:43:00.000Z	Stew2	trey3	pozac this isn't a critical system. I was annoyed that I had to install extra stuff (backports) just to get firefox to 1.0.x
2005-01-17T14:44:00.000Z	trey3	Stew2	just for kicks... cat /etc/issue
2005-01-17T14:45:00.000Z	trey3	Stew2	if that states 5.04, you are running hoary..
2005-01-17T14:45:00.000Z	trey3	Stew2	cuz you just stated a guide told you how to switch from sarge to hoary, and you followed it...
2005-01-17T14:45:00.000Z	Stew2	trey3	pozac It says warty. I've only installed the backports sofar. So Firefox is at least up to 1.x
2005-01-17T14:46:00.000Z	trey3	Stew2	ahh... ok...
2005-01-17T14:47:00.000Z	Stew2	trey3	I read it. I followed it with my eyes. It was a little confusing. Just cause you'all say I shouldn't switch to hoary yet... I've got to tell you, installing warty was no fun. For some reason, the fonts for X were never installed (default installation). So X wouldn't start. I had never troubleshooted X under warty/ubuntu/debian before.
