2011-06-03T02:36:00.000Z	noscript[laptop]		[HELP] possible malware; clam didn't do any scanning when installed, ever
2011-06-03T02:36:00.000Z	edbian	noscript[laptop]	What makes you think you have malware?
2011-06-03T02:37:00.000Z	edbian	noscript[laptop]	How do you know you aren't sending data?
2011-06-03T02:39:00.000Z	edbian	noscript[laptop]	I think it's just lag
2011-06-03T02:39:00.000Z	noscript[laptop]	edbian	i doubt it would be so when it was just fine when i tethered with my phone (until i got it more infected, which slowed it down when tethering)
2011-06-03T02:41:00.000Z	edbian	noscript[laptop]	viruses and malware in general are extremely rare in linux in the wild.  I sincerely doubt you have something malicious like that.  How is the phone infected?
2011-06-03T02:42:00.000Z	noscript[laptop]	edbian	installation of non-market apps
2011-06-03T02:42:00.000Z	edbian	noscript[laptop]	Well that's a possiblity
2011-06-03T02:43:00.000Z	edbian	noscript[laptop]	I think  though that your un-approved app is just hogging bandwidth and that your computer is completely fine.   Try a different network connection for your gaming
2011-06-03T02:44:00.000Z	noscript[laptop]	edbian	i mean when i use a normal wireless connection it gets out of sync... i recently reflashed my phone's ROM (Sprint/HTC Hero sucks w/ default ROM)
2011-06-03T02:45:00.000Z	edbian	noscript[laptop]	When you use normal wifi on the computer it gets out of sync
2011-06-03T02:45:00.000Z	noscript[laptop]	edbian	as in the computer sometimes it won't send anything while it can still receive just fine
2011-06-03T02:46:00.000Z	edbian	noscript[laptop]	Well I suggest you look through the processes in ps -e  Look up each name to see what it is.  If you find any malware then you'll know
2011-06-03T02:47:00.000Z	noscript[laptop]	edbian	thank you... ill check it out... (should i "sudo ps -e" or not?)
2011-06-03T02:47:00.000Z	edbian	noscript[laptop]	sudo is not needed
2011-06-03T02:47:00.000Z	noscript[laptop]	edbian	ok... good luck =)
2011-06-03T02:47:00.000Z	edbian	noscript[laptop]	good luck to you my friend
