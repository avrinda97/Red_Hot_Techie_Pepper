2011-07-20T12:54:00.000Z	janedoe		 hey, I have been thinking about about installing neorouter, however ubuntu gives me a notification about it being my risk installing it and that it could cause damage.. could anyone recommend doing it anyway?
2011-07-20T12:55:00.000Z	tomodachi	janedoe	what do you want? vpn?
2011-07-20T12:55:00.000Z	janedoe		yes
2011-07-20T12:55:00.000Z	tomodachi		between what?
2011-07-20T12:56:00.000Z	tomodachi		2 computers? 2 sites?
2011-07-20T12:56:00.000Z	janedoe		and the client as well
2011-07-20T12:56:00.000Z	janedoe		one computer
2011-07-20T12:56:00.000Z	tomodachi	janedoe	so its between two computers? what will you be running betweem those two computers?
2011-07-20T12:57:00.000Z	janedoe	tomodachi	it is more of the fact that I wanna have access to my computer from another computer, though I read that I ned the vpn-server first.. or sth.. I am not good at thsi yet..
2011-07-20T12:58:00.000Z	janedoe		*need
2011-07-20T12:58:00.000Z	janedoe		*this
2011-07-20T12:58:00.000Z	tomodachi	janedoe	i use openvpn for my vpn connections. Its quite simple to set up and will give you what you want
2011-07-20T12:58:00.000Z	tomodachi	janedoe	but if you only  want filesharing access and maybe remote controll you dont really need vpn. You can use ssh port forwarding. Thats why im asking for specifics.
2011-07-20T12:59:00.000Z	janedoe	tomodachi	oh really, that sounds cool.. I will try that one.. is it part of the apps on the software center or do I have to download it from the homepage?
2011-07-20T12:59:00.000Z	tomodachi		both exists in software center
2011-07-20T13:00:00.000Z	tomodachi		basically you can redirect ports through ssh  so they become enctrypted through the ssh tunnel
2011-07-20T13:00:00.000Z	tomodachi	janedoe	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH/OpenSSH/PortForwarding
2011-07-20T13:00:00.000Z	janedoe	tomodachi	kk, well I just wanna have administrative access and do whatever I wanna do ;)
2011-07-20T13:01:00.000Z	janedoe	tomodachi	well, thx so far..
