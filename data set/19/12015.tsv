2007-04-12T10:04:00.000Z	greenman		I'm gettting this error
2007-04-12T10:04:00.000Z	greenman		ERROR: Cannot compile against GLib.
2007-04-12T10:04:00.000Z	greenman		ERROR: You need libxml2 (http://www.xmlsoft.org/) to compile Gtk-Gnutella.
2007-04-12T10:04:00.000Z	greenman		But i checked and I have libxml2
2007-04-12T10:04:00.000Z	pestilence	greenman	do you have libxml2-dev
2007-04-12T10:04:00.000Z	greenman	pestilence	not sure, lemme check
2007-04-12T10:05:00.000Z	greenman	pestilence	I didn't.  Thanks.
2007-04-12T10:05:00.000Z	pestilence	greenman	sure
2007-04-12T10:06:00.000Z	pestilence	greenman	the easiest thing to do is "apt-get build-dep <whateverpackage>
2007-04-12T10:06:00.000Z	pestilence	greenman	you need -src repos for that command to work, of course
2007-04-12T10:07:00.000Z	greenman	pestilence	what do you mean?  Right now I'm trying to configure gtk-gnutella
2007-04-12T10:07:00.000Z	pestilence	greenman	if there is a ubuntu gtk-gnutella package, running "apt-get build-dep gtk-gnutella" will install everything you need to build gtk-gnutella
2007-04-12T10:08:00.000Z	greenman	pestilence	well I did a apt-get install gtk-gnutella and that worked fine, but when I went to run it, it said it was an ancient version.  So I went to the site to download and build it myself and ran into the problems
2007-04-12T10:08:00.000Z	pestilence	greenman	exactly.  so just do what i'm telling you to do.
2007-04-12T10:09:00.000Z	pestilence	greenman	you have the run-time dependencies.  not the build dependencies
2007-04-12T10:09:00.000Z	pestilence	greenman	you need things like header files to build, which aren't needed just for running
2007-04-12T10:09:00.000Z	pestilence	greenman	and build-dep will get those headers
2007-04-12T10:09:00.000Z	greenman	pestilence	ah, I'll do that
