2006-01-28T15:57:00.000Z	ompaul	preative	bios is bouncing like a mad thing
2006-01-28T15:58:00.000Z	preative	ompaul	anyway to fix that problem?
2006-01-28T15:59:00.000Z	ompaul	preative	it is not a problem - the bios is talking to the box after it figures out that it is going to boot the o/s
2006-01-28T16:01:00.000Z	ompaul	preative	sorry are you saying that your machine does not actually boot ubuntu at all?
2006-01-28T16:01:00.000Z	ompaul	preative	or have we a misunderstanding
2006-01-28T16:03:00.000Z	ompaul	preative	hit enter
2006-01-28T16:05:00.000Z	ompaul	preative	the syntax is avoiding me atm - try this >>set NOAPIC<< on that line
2006-01-28T16:05:00.000Z	ompaul	preative	maybe all lower case
2006-01-28T16:07:00.000Z	ompaul	preative	yes
2006-01-28T16:08:00.000Z	ompaul	preative	try it, it may need more but that is step one
2006-01-28T16:16:00.000Z	preative	ompaul	it said it could not find the kernal image
2006-01-28T16:23:00.000Z	preative	ompaul	i typed in the set noapic , and it said that it could not find kernal image. what now?
2006-01-28T16:31:00.000Z	ompaul	preative	there is something else let me find you a set of things to try
2006-01-28T16:34:00.000Z	ompaul	preative	I am having issues finding offical ubuntu docs on that
