2010-07-30T22:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ovnicraft	cool, please dont abbreviate like that unless its a defacto acronym like tcp or snmp etc
2010-07-30T22:11:00.000Z	ovnicraft	ActionParsnip	i cant run the server
2010-07-30T22:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ovnicraft	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PostgreSQL   may help
2010-07-30T22:13:00.000Z	ovnicraft	ActionParsnip	that site is poor
2010-07-30T22:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ovnicraft	have you asked in #pgp
2010-07-30T22:15:00.000Z	ovnicraft	ActionParsnip	yes they tell that ubuntu has init script
2010-07-30T22:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ovnicraft	ok, have you tried a reboot since the install?
2010-07-30T22:16:00.000Z	ovnicraft	ActionParsnip	in unix world you dont reboor to get a service up just run the daemon and works
2010-07-30T22:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ovnicraft	its free to try, might make it nice. I'm fully aware of the no reboot NIX mantra
2010-07-30T22:17:00.000Z	ovnicraft	ActionParsnip	are you telling me that daemon is not working?
2010-07-30T22:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ovnicraft	i'm just saying a reboot may fix it, you can check running daemons etc and you can restart them too
2010-07-30T22:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ovnicraft	you can ask in the other channel what file the app is looking for
2010-07-30T22:18:00.000Z	ovnicraft	ActionParsnip	i am feel like windows user in ubuntu with gnome faces
2010-07-30T22:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ovnicraft	its free to try, if a reboot is convenient then go for it
2010-07-30T22:18:00.000Z	ovnicraft	ActionParsnip	i want to know what is the script in deb file what configure the posgtgesql for me
