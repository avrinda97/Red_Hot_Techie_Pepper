2007-04-15T06:07:00.000Z	Lilacor	Linuturk	Ooooh..you're trying to get the game working I see.
2007-04-15T06:07:00.000Z	Linuturk	Lilacor	please help!
2007-04-15T06:07:00.000Z	Linuturk	Lilacor	I want to frack cylons
2007-04-15T06:08:00.000Z	Lilacor	Linuturk	 :S
2007-04-15T06:08:00.000Z	Lilacor	Linuturk	 I have never dealt with this program so I can't say very much.
2007-04-15T06:08:00.000Z	Lilacor	Linuturk	What libraries does it require?
2007-04-15T06:09:00.000Z	Lilacor	Linuturk	scratch that...do you have all of the necessary libraries?
2007-04-15T06:09:00.000Z	Linuturk	Lilacor	well, I have the appropriate libraries as far as I know, but my DRI is off, specifically the S3TC with the i915 chipset
2007-04-15T06:10:00.000Z	Lilacor	Linuturk	have you checked your chipset's OpenGL support?
2007-04-15T06:10:00.000Z	Linuturk	Lilacor	I've turned on S3TC using driconf, but I apparently need to compile one of the packages at the bottom of this page >> http://homepage.hispeed.ch/rscheidegger/dri_experimental/s3tc_index.html >> I've ran Freespace2 on this chipset before
2007-04-15T06:10:00.000Z	Linuturk	Lilacor	it can't hurt to recheck for open gl
2007-04-15T06:13:00.000Z	Linuturk	Lilacor	any ideas ?
2007-04-15T06:14:00.000Z	Lilacor	Linuturk	Hmmmm....have you tried using different drivers? [are there any available?] 
2007-04-15T06:15:00.000Z	Linuturk	Lilacor	no, I haven't tried that. I have the best drivers for my chipset with direct rendering out of the box
2007-04-15T06:15:00.000Z	Linuturk	Lilacor	or, I thought I did
2007-04-15T06:15:00.000Z	Lilacor	Linuturk	I'm sorry. I don't have any decent ideas since I am not using that application. :(
2007-04-15T06:16:00.000Z	Linuturk	Lilacor	thanks for trying
2007-04-15T06:16:00.000Z	Lilacor	Linuturk	Good luck. :)
