2008-10-20T17:14:00.000Z	greensun		what is the commad for opening a document
2008-10-20T17:14:00.000Z	LjjjL	greensun	gnome-open
2008-10-20T17:17:00.000Z	LjjjL	greensun	well of course it's asking you for the URL, how would it know which document to open if you don't tell it?
2008-10-20T17:23:00.000Z	LjjjL	greensun	i think i told you. gnome-open.
2008-10-20T17:25:00.000Z	LjjjL	greensun	... yes, you said that before. and i told you that, yes, it isn't a mindreader, you DO have to provide the FILENAME that you want opened
2008-10-20T17:27:00.000Z	LjjjL	greensun	NO, because it CAN'T KNOW what you want to open, why do you think your computer can ever read your mind?
2008-10-20T17:28:00.000Z	LjjjL	greensun	and what happened?
2008-10-20T17:29:00.000Z	LjjjL	greensun	i can't accept DCC CHATs. please talk in the channel.
2008-10-20T17:33:00.000Z	LjjjL	greensun	can you answer ikonia please?
2008-10-20T17:34:00.000Z	LjjjL	greensun	and you can. gnome-open filename   (or gvfs-open filename since apparently gnome-open is a bit broken)
2008-10-20T17:35:00.000Z	LjjjL	greensun	if it says the location is not found, then you're typing the pathname and filename wrong.
2008-10-20T17:37:00.000Z	LjjjL	greensun	what did you type?
2008-10-20T17:39:00.000Z	LjjjL	greensun	i think you were asked to type "cd Desktop" now.
2008-10-20T17:39:00.000Z	LjjjL	greensun	although i suggest you type "cd ~/Desktop" instead
2008-10-20T17:39:00.000Z	LjjjL	greensun	then, you were asked to type "ls"
2008-10-20T17:40:00.000Z	LjjjL	greensun	anyway, you can't type filenames containing spaces like that. type      gnome-open New    then hit the TAB key.
2008-10-20T17:43:00.000Z	LjjjL	greensun	it could have worked 10 minutes ago, if you had answered our questions as asked. still, cheers.
2008-10-20T17:52:00.000Z	LjjjL	greensun	well, of course you'll now have to type the command using the new name. what is it, by the way?
2008-10-20T18:41:00.000Z	LjjjL	greensun	your file browser does have an address bar. it shows up as soon as you hit /, or the button on the left
