2008-10-18T18:23:00.000Z	eth		Hey guys! I got a bit of a problem. I'm trying to install Ubuntu on a P5Q Deluxe motherboard(not on the actual board). But I seem to have hit a snag when it's searching for devices. It stops at 50% and then stays there for 20 seconds. Then the whole computer just freezes. Any help would be appricated
2008-10-18T18:25:00.000Z	eth		Is there someone that might be able to help me?
2008-10-18T18:26:00.000Z	jrib	eth	best to just ask the channel your question
2008-10-18T18:26:00.000Z	eth	jrib	I actually did, it was rather neglected :)
2008-10-18T18:26:00.000Z	jrib	eth	best to just repeat
2008-10-18T18:27:00.000Z	jrib	eth	did you 'check the cd for defects' from the CD's boot menu?
2008-10-18T18:28:00.000Z	eth	jrib	Yea, I tried it once when the disc was brand new. No problemos, and once after i've tried to install it. Then I had one error. But i've tried different versions and maybe 3-4 cd/dvds
2008-10-18T18:29:00.000Z	jrib	eth	if you get errors on the "check CD for defects", you can't use the CD to install.  Try burning at 2x speed
2008-10-18T18:30:00.000Z	eth	jrib	Yea I get that. But I have like two other ones that doesnt have any defects. But still doesn't install.
2008-10-18T18:30:00.000Z	jrib	eth	what two other ones?
2008-10-18T18:30:00.000Z	eth	jrib	CDs
2008-10-18T18:30:00.000Z	jrib	eth	of the desktop cd?
2008-10-18T18:30:00.000Z	eth	jrib	Livecd
2008-10-18T18:30:00.000Z	jrib	eth	what version of ubuntu?
2008-10-18T18:31:00.000Z	eth	jrib	I've tried 8.04 LTS x64 and 8.10 beta x64
2008-10-18T18:31:00.000Z	jrib	eth	k, they're just called desktop CDs.  Did you try the alternate cd to see if was any better?
2008-10-18T18:32:00.000Z	eth	jrib	That's the only thing I haven't done yet.
2008-10-18T18:32:00.000Z	eth	jrib	I guess i'll give it a try
2008-10-18T18:49:00.000Z	eth	jrib	that seems to work, got through the 'search device' thing
