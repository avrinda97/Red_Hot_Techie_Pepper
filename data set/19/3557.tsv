2009-10-04T14:25:00.000Z	Keiffer		Hi. Do you recommend using the 64bit version of Ubuntu? Do I have access tho all apps in 32bit version?
2009-10-04T14:26:00.000Z	lstarnes	Keiffer	there may be some minor compatibility issues, but almost everything in the 32-bit version works in the 64-bit version
2009-10-04T14:33:00.000Z	lstarnes	Keiffer	that is personal preference
2009-10-04T14:33:00.000Z	lstarnes	Keiffer	yes
2009-10-04T14:40:00.000Z	lstarnes	Keiffer	the cores are different too
2009-10-04T14:40:00.000Z	lstarnes	Keiffer	kde uses qt for widgets while gnome and xfce use gtk
2009-10-04T14:51:00.000Z	lstarnes	Keiffer	there is also wine for some windoes apps
2009-10-04T15:06:00.000Z	lstarnes	Keiffer	I don't think so
2009-10-04T15:29:00.000Z	lstarnes	Keiffer	virtualbox and other virtual machines require a windows license and an installation of windows irself
2009-10-04T15:31:00.000Z	Keiffer	lstarnes	what do you mean? can't i use virtual inside ubuntu and install windows?
2009-10-04T15:31:00.000Z	lstarnes	Keiffer	you can
2009-10-04T15:33:00.000Z	Keiffer	lstarnes	and i can use a cracked iso of win, can i?
2009-10-04T15:33:00.000Z	lstarnes	Keiffer	you should only use a legal copy with a legal license
2009-10-04T15:33:00.000Z	lstarnes	Keiffer	we do not advocate or allow piracy here
2009-10-04T15:33:00.000Z	lstarnes	Keiffer	even if it is a product by microsoft
2009-10-04T15:35:00.000Z	Keiffer	lstarnes	what is my alternative? i do have a laptop with vista with licence. can i put that licence on the pc and ubuntu on laptop?
2009-10-04T15:35:00.000Z	lstarnes	Keiffer	buy a copy of windows
2009-10-04T17:55:00.000Z	Keiffer	lstarnes	no SED it was! thanks
2009-10-04T17:54:00.000Z	lstarnes	Keiffer	maybe sed, but I'm probably wrong
