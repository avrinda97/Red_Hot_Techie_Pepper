2007-11-19T15:27:00.000Z	Myrtti	tritty	just ask you're question
2007-11-19T15:32:00.000Z	Myrtti	tritty	where do you get that circular mouse thing
2007-11-19T15:33:00.000Z	Myrtti	tritty	no I mean when you're trying to boot to ubuntu?
2007-11-19T15:34:00.000Z	Myrtti	tritty	to which OS are you trying to boot into when you get that pink screen
2007-11-19T15:34:00.000Z	Myrtti	tritty	windows or ubuntu?
2007-11-19T15:35:00.000Z	Myrtti	tritty	so actually it has nothing to do with windows
2007-11-19T15:35:00.000Z	Myrtti	tritty	you're trying to install with the Desktop CD
2007-11-19T15:36:00.000Z	Myrtti	tritty	did you check if the disk was ok before you started the installation?
2007-11-19T15:37:00.000Z	Myrtti	tritty	when you've started your computer with the installation cd in, there should come about a menu which allows you to pick what to do
2007-11-19T15:37:00.000Z	Myrtti	tritty	one of those options is about checking the cd
2007-11-19T15:37:00.000Z	Myrtti	tritty	and it was ok?
2007-11-19T15:49:00.000Z	Myrtti	tritty	have you tried installing ubuntu before?
2007-11-19T15:47:00.000Z	Myrtti	tritty	barely
2007-11-19T15:48:00.000Z	Myrtti	tritty	so what kind of hardware do you run? have you checked the net if anyone has had trouble with, for instance, your display driver?
2007-11-19T15:50:00.000Z	Myrtti	tritty	so you not having trouble with your display driver (in Windows) doesn't mean that you couldn't have problems with it while installing ubuntu
2007-11-19T15:51:00.000Z	Myrtti	tritty	so, have you checked the net if anyone else has had trouble with the same kind of display driver when installing ubuntu or using it
2007-11-19T15:52:00.000Z	Myrtti	tritty	do you know anything about your hardware? if it's a laptop, the model number etc
