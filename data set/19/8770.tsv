2007-02-17T08:29:00.000Z	Psy		hey guys
2007-02-17T08:29:00.000Z	Psy		i left a ubuntu setup running on a 266 overnight and now i've forgotten what username i gave it - i can remember the password, is there anyway to login as root?
2007-02-17T08:30:00.000Z	ardchoille	Psy	You can boot into recovery mode, that'll give you a root shell.
2007-02-17T08:31:00.000Z	ardchoille	Psy	Press the ESC key during boot and you'll get a grub menu. You can choose recovery from that.
2007-02-17T08:35:00.000Z	ardchoille	Psy	How many users did you set up?
2007-02-17T08:39:00.000Z	ardchoille	Psy	ls /home
2007-02-17T08:40:00.000Z	ardchoille	Psy	users-admin is a GUI app and won't work in a vt
2007-02-17T08:41:00.000Z	ardchoille	Psy	Did you install the oem mode?
2007-02-17T08:41:00.000Z	Psy	ardchoille	- to be honest, i don;t have a clue
2007-02-17T08:41:00.000Z	ardchoille	Psy	I think you did. Did the system ever ask you to set a username and admin password?
2007-02-17T08:43:00.000Z	ardchoille	Psy	If ls /home returns only oem, I think you installed in oem mode, If that is the case, just boot it up and it will let you setup a user,
2007-02-17T08:43:00.000Z	Psy	ardchoille	it took me to the logon screen
2007-02-17T08:43:00.000Z	ardchoille	Psy	Ok, then it may not have been oem.
2007-02-17T08:44:00.000Z	ardchoille	Psy	You still in recovery?
2007-02-17T08:44:00.000Z	Psy	ardchoille	what if i try to create a new user fromt he recovery console?
2007-02-17T08:45:00.000Z	ardchoille	Psy	cat /etc/passwd   <-- and look near the bottom of that list to see if you recognise any usernames
2007-02-17T08:47:00.000Z	ardchoille	Psy	Yeah, I think you installed in oem  mode. Not sure how to get into it as I never used that install methond.
2007-02-17T08:48:00.000Z	ardchoille	Psy	See the link Aldoliel just posted for you
2007-02-17T08:49:00.000Z	ardchoille	Psy	I thought so, since ls /home returned oem
