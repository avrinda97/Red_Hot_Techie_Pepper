2010-11-04T02:09:00.000Z	neil_d	pw-toxic_	"route"
2010-11-04T02:09:00.000Z	pw-toxic_	neil_d	there is no gateway.. it says "*"
2010-11-04T02:10:00.000Z	pw-toxic_	neil_d	one single star at the column of gateway.. this means there is no gateway set?
2010-11-04T02:10:00.000Z	neil_d	pw-toxic_	try "sudo route"
2010-11-04T02:11:00.000Z	pw-toxic_	neil_d	area51pilot neil_d same output... 192.168.42.0   *   255.255.255.0  U  1  0   0  eth0
2010-11-04T02:11:00.000Z	pw-toxic_	neil_d	but please consider that my NAT router is on 192.178.42.1, not 0
2010-11-04T02:13:00.000Z	pw-toxic_	neil_d	do you k now how i can set the gateway manually?
2010-11-04T02:13:00.000Z	neil_d	pw-toxic_	area51pilot  have you checked the /etc/network/interfaces file to see if its brings up eth0 correctly
2010-11-04T02:18:00.000Z	neil_d	pw-toxic_	use the /etc/resolv.conf file
2010-11-04T02:21:00.000Z	pw-toxic_	neil_d	area51pilot /etc/resolv.conf is empty.. is this normal?  only "#Generated by Networkmanager"
2010-11-04T02:21:00.000Z	neil_d	pw-toxic_	no!
2010-11-04T02:22:00.000Z	pw-toxic_	neil_d	what should be found there?.. do i need to restart networking or something like this after i change resolv.conf?
2010-11-04T02:23:00.000Z	neil_d	pw-toxic_	it should have a line... nameserver x.x.x.x ... in it, thou this wont be perminent
2010-11-04T02:25:00.000Z	neil_d	pw-toxic_	area51pilot : how is the dhcp done.?.. is it done by a router etc.?
2010-11-04T02:29:00.000Z	neil_d	pw-toxic_	it does on my setup... I would look at the configuration of the network and "network manager"
2010-11-04T02:29:00.000Z	pw-toxic_	neil_d	what should i look for concretly? i've already looked at the network manager
