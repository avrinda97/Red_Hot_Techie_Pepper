2011-12-14T05:41:00.000Z	Octopus		XFCE has long been weak for DE machines, and Canonical is positioning this as a distribution is "for slower machines."
2011-12-14T05:42:00.000Z	Octopus		bad translate prog sorry
2011-12-14T05:43:00.000Z	Octopus		XFCE is now not suitable for older machines.
2011-12-14T05:44:00.000Z	Octopus		No longer suitable. Xubuntu just slows down for them. A Lubuntu works fine and fast. Then what is the meaning of the sponsor Xubuntu?
2011-12-14T05:45:00.000Z	Octopus		Why are you all silent?
2011-12-14T05:45:00.000Z	Octopus		What is your opinion?
2011-12-14T05:46:00.000Z	Octopus		Where can I find chat of Canonical?

2011-12-14T05:46:00.000Z	szal	Octopus	and define 'chat of Canonical'
2011-12-14T05:47:00.000Z	szal	Octopus	and what do you mean by "what is the meaning of the sponsor Xubuntu"?
2011-12-14T05:49:00.000Z	szal	Octopus	you want to what?
2011-12-14T05:50:00.000Z	szal	Octopus	start making sense or stop it altogether
2011-12-14T05:51:00.000Z	Octopus	szal	Xubuntu has lost its relevance.
2011-12-14T05:52:00.000Z	szal	Octopus	seeing that flocks of Gnome 2 lovers are switching over to XFCE, I don't think Xubuntu will become irrelevant anytime soon
2011-12-14T05:53:00.000Z	szal	Octopus	other than that, this is really not a support issue -> take it to #ubuntu-offtopic or leave it
2011-12-14T05:55:00.000Z	szal	Octopus	again, -offtopic or stfukthxbye
2011-12-14T05:57:00.000Z	szal	Octopus	obviously YOU don't understand..  what you're trying to talk about is NOT a support issue
