2005-09-21T05:20:00.000Z	cafuego_	cyphase	I doubt it
2005-09-27T05:30:00.000Z	cafuego_	cyphase	Yes, 'bash'.
2005-09-27T05:30:00.000Z	cafuego_	cyphase	Can't say I do.
2005-09-27T05:31:00.000Z	cafuego_	cyphase	No good ones, no.
2005-09-27T05:31:00.000Z	cafuego_	cyphase	Payware
2005-10-22T06:46:00.000Z	cafuego_	cyphase	Tools -> Options -> Writer -> Language
2005-10-22T06:50:00.000Z	cyphase	cafuego_	it's not working
2005-10-22T06:51:00.000Z	cyphase	cafuego_	ok..

2005-10-22T06:53:00.000Z	cafuego_	cyphase	Do you have that set in the LANG and LOCALE vars too?

2007-01-06T17:50:00.000Z	cafuego_	cyphase	We now have something of that sort here (a worse one than the US) but it's still not illegal to use DeCSS to watch your DVDs on Linux (or format-shift them to say an iPod)
