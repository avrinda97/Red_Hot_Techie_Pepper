2006-01-05T13:44:00.000Z	ph8		Can anyone tell me where the keyboard config is? I've got the wrong layout set
2006-01-05T13:44:00.000Z	ph8		(command line)
2006-01-05T13:45:00.000Z	ph8		ja
2006-01-05T13:45:00.000Z	ph8		I thought I selected dutch but obviously not
2006-01-05T13:45:00.000Z	ph8		well a dutch keyboard
2006-01-05T13:46:00.000Z	ph8		It's a command line only box
2006-01-05T13:48:00.000Z	ph8		It's actually for a friend, I'm english
2006-01-05T13:49:00.000Z	ph8		there's not a config file for the keyboard somewhere though?
2006-01-05T13:50:00.000Z	ph8		but there's no xorg.conf
2006-01-05T13:50:00.000Z	ph8		as it's not installed?
2006-01-05T13:51:00.000Z	erUSUL	ph8	all i can say is man install-keymap
2007-07-14T05:34:00.000Z	erUSUL	ph8	launchpad? file a bug report with the patch to the apropiate package
2007-07-14T05:35:00.000Z	ph8	erUSUL	I just attach the file to the bug report?
2007-07-14T05:36:00.000Z	erUSUL	ph8	there is, but i guess that you do not have acces to it, do you? i think that a bug report in launchpad is the best aproach
2008-08-10T18:19:00.000Z	erUSUL	ph8	whats the error ping throws?
2008-08-10T18:19:00.000Z	ph8	erUSUL	just can't reach host - i might have interfaces configured wrong actually, sec
2008-08-10T18:19:00.000Z	ph8	erUSUL	 # ping 10.0.0.3
2008-08-18T18:51:00.000Z	erUSUL	ph8	yep
