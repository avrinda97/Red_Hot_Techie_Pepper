2011-08-06T12:42:00.000Z	LarsTorben		Yes, I think to tell you a good explanation
2011-08-06T12:43:00.000Z	LarsTorben		Well, I think I asked the problem before. But no good help.
2011-08-06T12:43:00.000Z	LarsTorben		!help | samy3
2011-08-06T12:44:00.000Z	LarsTorben		I am usinh WIndows 7 by now, because Ubuntu 11.04 did not work good for me. I have a problem with window maximzing. SInce 11.04 Ubuntu uses Compiz because Unity
2011-08-06T12:46:00.000Z	LarsTorben		I will first try to explain the problem
2011-08-06T12:46:00.000Z	LarsTorben		OK, thanks.
2011-08-06T12:47:00.000Z	LarsTorben		Well, my problem with Unity is, Unity uses 2 workspaces vertical, 2 desktops horizontal
2011-08-06T12:47:00.000Z	oCean	LarsTorben	it is really not necessary to explain the problem. You have done so before. The bugs logged against this problem have not been solved
2011-08-06T12:48:00.000Z	oCean	LarsTorben	so this channel cannot provide a solution for you at this point
2011-08-06T12:48:00.000Z	oCean	LarsTorben	I think they are working on it. Yours is marked as "duplicate" so there are others.
2011-08-06T12:49:00.000Z	oCean	LarsTorben	unfortunately in your bug, the duplicates are (incorrectly) not mentioned. I'll do a little search at Launchpad
2011-08-06T12:49:00.000Z	oCean	LarsTorben	ok, if it is *never* going to be fixed, then we still cannot provide the solution. For now, let me have a look at LP (other related bugs)
2011-08-06T12:51:00.000Z	oCean	LarsTorben	ok, let me see
2011-08-06T12:58:00.000Z	oCean	LarsTorben	ok, I did not exactly read that "it is a feature" but there are hints that indicate that. I don't fully understand, since I use KDE, but with this many users affected I would expect some solutions. In https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/compiz/+bug/776435 a workaround is mentioned for unity-2d (final post)
2011-08-06T13:00:00.000Z	oCean	LarsTorben	unfortunately, as IdleOne states, you have to wait. We (this channel) channot help you with a solution
2011-08-06T13:01:00.000Z	oCean	LarsTorben	exactly.
2011-08-06T13:01:00.000Z	oCean	LarsTorben	it's your choice. Can you live with one workspace?
2011-08-06T13:02:00.000Z	oCean	LarsTorben	ok, that's the way to go then for now!
2011-08-06T13:03:00.000Z	oCean	LarsTorben	thank you too
