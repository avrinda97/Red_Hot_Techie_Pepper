2009-03-15T08:10:00.000Z	b1n42y		is NM supposed to manage connections on 8.10 server?
2009-03-15T08:12:00.000Z	tritium	b1n42y	server installs do not install a desktop environment, so I would suspect not.
2009-03-15T08:12:00.000Z	b1n42y	tritium	ahh ok thanks
2009-03-15T08:12:00.000Z	tritium	b1n42y	if you decided to install a desktop, then you could easily make it do so, however
2009-03-15T08:13:00.000Z	b1n42y	tritium	so id need to set that up from within NM ?
2009-03-15T08:13:00.000Z	tritium	b1n42y	set which up?
2009-03-15T08:14:00.000Z	b1n42y	tritium	Network manager
2009-03-15T08:15:00.000Z	tritium	b1n42y	you're asking if you'd need to setup network manager within network manager.   I don't understand.
2009-03-15T08:15:00.000Z	b1n42y	tritium	if you decided to install a desktop, then you could easily make it do so, however   > so how do i do that
2009-03-15T08:17:00.000Z	tritium	b1n42y	if you want gnome, sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop.  kubuntu-desktop for KDE, and xubuntu-desktop for xfce.
2009-03-15T08:19:00.000Z	b1n42y	tritium	given my question was is NM supposed to control network connections i thought it was implied that i had already installed ubuntu-desktop
2009-03-15T08:20:00.000Z	tritium	b1n42y	it was not, as you asked about server installs, for which desktop environments are not default
2009-03-15T08:22:00.000Z	b1n42y	tritium	so now you know, my bad ...  , how do i solve this
2009-03-15T08:22:00.000Z	tritium	b1n42y	so, if you have ubuntu-desktop installed, you have the choice of configuring network-manager, or configuring your interfaces manually in /etc/network/interfaces
2009-03-15T08:23:00.000Z	b1n42y	tritium	well my network works so configs are fine, just would like to have it setup in NM, ive tried adding wired connection, but doesnt seem to work
2009-03-15T08:25:00.000Z	tritium	b1n42y	I'm not a big fan of NM, myself, actually.
2009-03-15T08:26:00.000Z	b1n42y	tritium	same i use wicd on my laptop
2009-03-15T08:26:00.000Z	tritium	b1n42y	cool.  So, I may not be the best person to advise you on configuring NM, if that's your intent.
2009-03-15T08:27:00.000Z	b1n42y	tritium	thanks
