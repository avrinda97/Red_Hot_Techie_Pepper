2008-09-24T08:58:00.000Z	carpediem	chilli0	is it a public file we can get?
2008-09-24T09:00:00.000Z	chilli0	carpediem	 have you looked at it?
2008-09-24T09:00:00.000Z	carpediem	chilli0	well, it's 14 megs, give me a bit
2008-09-24T10:05:00.000Z	carpediem	chilli0	that die hard thing is not a theme, you have to extract it.  Then there is a folder inside called Emerald Window Border, and it has the emerald theme inside.
2008-09-24T10:06:00.000Z	chilli0	carpediem	 go here if u want it http://www.gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Die+Hard+4.0+GTK+theme?content=84355
2008-09-24T10:08:00.000Z	carpediem	chilli0	to each his own, that's one of the ugliest themes I've ever seen.
