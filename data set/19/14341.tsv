2004-12-08T17:57:00.000Z	crimsun	SmokingFire	DSL == DamnSmall Linux
2005-01-06T12:29:00.000Z	crimsun	SmokingFire	dpkg just handles installing and removing packages
2005-01-06T12:29:00.000Z	crimsun	SmokingFire	other programs layer on top of dpkg to handle repos
2005-01-06T12:30:00.000Z	SmokingFire	crimsun	to bad. As I have a deb package with a bunch of depenencies. But getting those depends manually is PITA
2005-01-06T12:30:00.000Z	crimsun	SmokingFire	what package?
2005-01-06T12:31:00.000Z	SmokingFire	crimsun	xmltv and eventually gnometv
2005-01-06T12:32:00.000Z	crimsun	SmokingFire	xmltv is in hoary/universe. Do you have the 'universe' repo enabled?
2005-01-06T12:32:00.000Z	SmokingFire	crimsun	I have, I must have overlooked it
2005-01-06T12:34:00.000Z	SmokingFire	crimsun	I can't find it. I have universe and multiverse enabled
2005-01-06T12:34:00.000Z	crimsun	SmokingFire	`apt-cache policy xmltv'
2005-01-06T12:34:00.000Z	crimsun	SmokingFire	if that returns nothing, then it's only in hoary/universe
2005-01-06T12:35:00.000Z	SmokingFire	crimsun	returns nothing
2005-01-06T12:35:00.000Z	crimsun	SmokingFire	then it's as I said regarding hoary/universe
2005-01-06T12:36:00.000Z	SmokingFire	crimsun	I'm adding the hoary repos temporary just to fetch it
2005-01-06T12:37:00.000Z	crimsun	SmokingFire	that's a really dangerous thing to do...
2005-01-06T12:37:00.000Z	SmokingFire	crimsun	as long as it can't physically destroy my computer its ok.
2005-01-06T12:38:00.000Z	crimsun	SmokingFire	you might end up with a bigger headache
