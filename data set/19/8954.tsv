2007-02-20T09:54:00.000Z	Pici		Is there an easy way for me to tell if I have the proprietary or open ATI drivers installed? I cant remember what I used when I set this thing up.
2007-02-20T09:54:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Pici	 look in the /etc/X11/xorg.conf file for the 'Driver" line
2007-02-20T09:54:00.000Z	Pici	Dr_willis	Thanks
2007-02-20T09:55:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Pici	 Driver "fglrx" or "Driver "ati""
2007-06-28T09:49:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Pici	 porn?
2007-09-24T09:21:00.000Z	Pici	Dr_willis	I remember it because I use `invoke-rc.d ` to stop and start services

2008-05-15T21:01:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Pici	theres a better way to change the default shell from dash to bash.
2008-05-15T21:01:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Pici	 i think its 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure bash' (or was it sh, or dash)
2008-05-15T21:02:00.000Z	Pici	Dr_willis	Thats probably a better route then
2008-05-15T21:02:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Pici	 i had a 'heated' forum discussion once with some script writers on their improper suggestions on how to 'fix' ubuntu's 'dash' problem. :) which wasent a problem at al.. the problemw as with THEIR stuff. :)
