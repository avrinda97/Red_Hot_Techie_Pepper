2009-08-23T02:19:00.000Z	lstarnes	need_help	you need a different package that provides uuencode

2009-08-23T02:20:00.000Z	lstarnes	need_help	I think it's in sharutils
2009-08-23T02:20:00.000Z	lstarnes	need_help	try apt-file search uuencode
2009-08-23T02:21:00.000Z	need_help	lstarnes	try :  http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/257730/
2009-08-23T02:21:00.000Z	lstarnes	need_help	then do as it says and install sharutils
2009-08-23T02:22:00.000Z	lstarnes	need_help	that package contains uuencode and uudecode along with other tools
2009-08-23T02:22:00.000Z	need_help	lstarnes	ok i'm installing dependency although apt must do it
2009-08-23T02:23:00.000Z	need_help	lstarnes	same error i install sharlutils and try to install uuencode didn't work ! it say there is another package similar!
2009-08-23T02:24:00.000Z	lstarnes	need_help	the package's name is sharutils, not sharlutils
