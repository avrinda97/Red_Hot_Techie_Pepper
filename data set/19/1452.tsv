2011-01-21T22:21:00.000Z	gordonjcp	okletsgo	"./src/hantekdsoio.h:23: fatal error: usb.h: Datei oder Verzeichnis nicht gefunden"
2011-01-21T22:22:00.000Z	gordonjcp	okletsgo	that suggests that you are missing the libusb headers, try installing libusb-dev or something similar
2011-01-21T22:23:00.000Z	gordonjcp	okletsgo	what are you trying to do?
2011-01-21T22:26:00.000Z	okletsgo	gordonjcp	| i am trying to install my DOS-2090 Scope under Ubuntu10.10 .  i have to be possible with OpenHantek and this i'm trying to install at the moment :) http://how-to.wikia.com/wiki/How_to_use_the_Hantek_DSO-2100_USB_oscilloscope_in_Linux this is the only usable tutorial if found on google.
2011-01-21T22:26:00.000Z	gordonjcp	okletsgo	awesome
2011-01-21T22:27:00.000Z	gordonjcp	okletsgo	right, how far have you got?
2011-01-21T22:28:00.000Z	okletsgo	gordonjcp	| fatal error: fftw3.h what should i do?
2011-01-21T22:28:00.000Z	gordonjcp	okletsgo	sounds like you're missing libfftw, too
2011-01-21T22:29:00.000Z	gordonjcp	okletsgo	give me a few minutes to grab the sources
2011-01-21T22:35:00.000Z	gordonjcp	okletsgo	looking good so far
2011-01-21T22:36:00.000Z	gordonjcp	okletsgo	ping?
2011-01-21T22:38:00.000Z	gordonjcp	okletsgo	I got OpenHantek to compile, after installing qt4-make, libqt4-dev and libusb-dev
2011-01-21T22:38:00.000Z	gordonjcp	okletsgo	it may also require libfftw3-dev but I already had that
2011-01-21T22:39:00.000Z	gordonjcp	okletsgo	I have to go out for a while, but give that a shot and let me know how you get on ;-)
2011-01-21T22:58:00.000Z	okletsgo	gordonjcp	and undecim | thanks a lot it works fine now :)
