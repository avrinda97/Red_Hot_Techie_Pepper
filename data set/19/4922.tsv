2009-06-09T09:51:00.000Z	frybye		I am trying to set up a command that will be executed at start of the pc - I want it to run this command "  nvidia-settings -l --config=~/.nvidia-settings-rc "
2009-06-09T09:52:00.000Z	losher	frybye	to run it once at boot time, put it in /etc/rc.local
2009-06-09T09:54:00.000Z	frybye	losher	ok thanks. Istarnes - it should run at every reboot - so puting it in /etc/rc.local is right or...?
2009-06-09T09:55:00.000Z	losher	frybye	rohit: oh. I thought it was a one time per boot thing, in which case it can go in /etc/rc.local
2009-06-09T09:56:00.000Z	frybye	losher	it IS a one time per boot thing!!
2009-06-09T09:56:00.000Z	losher	frybye	then put in in /etc/rc.local...
2009-06-09T09:59:00.000Z	losher	frybye	The question is, when *exactly* should the command run, and by whom?
2009-06-09T09:59:00.000Z	frybye	losher	every time the pc starts - is just to get the resoloution setting right -
2009-06-09T10:01:00.000Z	losher	frybye	then you can safely place the line in /etc/rc.local, creating the file if necessary. You may want to expand the "~" explicitly so there are no surprises at run time.
2009-06-09T10:05:00.000Z	losher	frybye	do you really mean every time the pc starts, or do you actually mean every time the x-server starts?
2009-06-09T10:05:00.000Z	losher	frybye	do you really mean every time the pc starts, or do you actually mean every time the x-server starts?
2009-06-09T10:05:00.000Z	losher	frybye	do you really mean every time the pc starts, or do you actually mean every time the x-server starts?
2009-06-09T10:06:00.000Z	frybye	losher	probably the later...
2009-06-09T10:06:00.000Z	losher	frybye	then /etc/rc.local may not be the right place after all. You'll know after testing it...
2009-06-09T10:07:00.000Z	frybye	losher	should I just creat it..??
2009-06-09T10:08:00.000Z	frybye	losher	if a session runs ok it will only have to start xserver once normally or... then wont make much difference or...?
2009-06-09T10:08:00.000Z	losher	frybye	yes, you just create /etc/rc.local
2009-06-09T10:10:00.000Z	losher	frybye	there may be some timing issues. /etc/rc.local runs before any user logs in. The worst that can happen is that the resolution won't be set properly, so its ok to try thiis
2009-06-09T10:10:00.000Z	losher	frybye	yes, you just create /etc/rc.local if it doesn't already exist
