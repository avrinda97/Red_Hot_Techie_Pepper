2010-03-01T12:52:00.000Z	zebastian		its a wireless-G broadband router
2010-03-01T12:52:00.000Z	DelphiWorld	zebastian	how your ISP connect you to the internet? static IP? PPPOE?
2010-03-01T12:53:00.000Z	zebastian	DelphiWorld	how do i find this out?
2010-03-01T12:53:00.000Z	zebastian		i am on a cable connection
2010-03-01T12:53:00.000Z	DelphiWorld	zebastian	you use ubuntu?
2010-03-01T12:54:00.000Z	zebastian		yes, i use ubuntu hardy
2010-03-01T12:54:00.000Z	zebastian		by the way more specifically i have a WRT54G2 V1 router
2010-03-01T12:54:00.000Z	DelphiWorld	zebastian	reset the router to default config
2010-03-01T12:55:00.000Z	zebastian	DelphiWorld	how do i do that from ubuntu? you see i set up the router when it had windows
2010-03-01T12:55:00.000Z	zebastian		with the cd
2010-03-01T12:55:00.000Z	zebastian		i threw that away when i switched to ubuntu
2010-03-01T12:55:00.000Z	DelphiWorld	zebastian	and go to your ubuntu shell and type: ifconfig and check your ethernet nic ip
2010-03-01T12:56:00.000Z	zebastian	DelphiWorld	http://paste.ubuntu.com/386150/
2010-03-01T12:57:00.000Z	zebastian	DelphiWorld	by the way i did see this http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1230662 and of course thats impossible as i dont have a windows computer anymore, i am a happy ubuntu user
2010-03-01T12:58:00.000Z	DelphiWorld	zebastian	i think your ip is public, wait
2010-03-01T12:59:00.000Z	DelphiWorld	zebastian	have you configured your ip in the router or no?
2010-03-01T13:00:00.000Z	DelphiWorld	zebastian	and your ip is static or dynamic?
2010-03-01T13:01:00.000Z	zebastian	DelphiWorld	i dont know if my ip is static or dynamic, i pay the cable company as far that goes,,,never had to deal with htis before, pardon my ignorance, and i had configured the router on the same computer, but with windows and a gui install cd
