2009-03-02T08:05:00.000Z	jhonnyboy		Hello does anyone know how to use Wine? I am having trouble installing software...
2009-03-02T08:05:00.000Z	archer	jhonnyboy	i've used wine to some level, what are you trying to do?
2009-03-02T08:09:00.000Z	archer	jhonnyboy	do you know what version of Wine you are using?
2009-03-02T08:10:00.000Z	jhonnyboy	archer	I am using Wine 1.0.1
2009-03-02T08:11:00.000Z	archer	jhonnyboy	using the same version i've never had any issues running .exe files of any sort.   also, the default settings of wine should be pretty much all you need
2009-03-02T08:11:00.000Z	jhonnyboy	archer	Thanks archer.
2009-03-02T08:11:00.000Z	jhonnyboy	archer	Why do you think i am getting that error message?
2009-03-02T08:12:00.000Z	jhonnyboy	archer	It can't find a volume for extraction, and Ubuntu isn't letting me mount any of my disks all of the sudden.
2009-03-02T08:14:00.000Z	archer	jhonnyboy	that's pretty strange, least i've never had that problem.  treating the two problems as seperate, i'd make sure the .exe file is in a directory all users have read and write privlages too
2009-03-02T08:14:00.000Z	archer	jhonnyboy	as far as the mounting issue, i've never heard of that, first thing i'd do though is restart.
2009-03-02T08:15:00.000Z	jhonnyboy	archer	Should i mount them before i try to install anything?
2009-03-02T08:15:00.000Z	jhonnyboy	archer	Also for some odd reason, when i do a warm boot from Ubuntu, my computer freezes at the BIOS/POST. This doesn't happen when i warm boot from XP though.
2009-03-02T08:16:00.000Z	jhonnyboy	archer	could that be Grub?
2009-03-02T08:16:00.000Z	archer	jhonnyboy	 i wouldn't think so, grub should treat everything equally.
2009-03-02T08:47:00.000Z	archer	jhonnyboy	 what exactly are you trying to run/install?
2009-03-02T08:48:00.000Z	jhonnyboy	archer	Microsoft Visual Basic Express Edition
2009-03-02T08:48:00.000Z	jhonnyboy	archer	I am trying to install it.
2009-03-02T08:48:00.000Z	jhonnyboy	archer	i have the vbsetup.exe on my desktop/
2009-03-02T08:49:00.000Z	archer	jhonnyboy	i'm not familiar with it, but just an idea, everything i've run so far i've run off of a cd.    wine might for some reason like it more if it is on a cd, just for kicks, i'd try putting the exe file on a cd and installing from that.
