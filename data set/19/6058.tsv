2008-03-23T01:29:00.000Z	Deusdies		can anyone please help me? Ubuntu doesn't recognize my TV card! :(
2008-03-23T01:30:00.000Z	saminthemiddle	Deusdies	that happens a lot
2008-03-23T01:30:00.000Z	Deusdies	saminthemiddle	that means that there is solution, right? :S
2008-03-23T01:31:00.000Z	saminthemiddle	Deusdies	no, I'm saying that support for TV cards is weak at best
2008-03-23T01:31:00.000Z	saminthemiddle	Deusdies	are you sure that it is a supported model? what is the chipset?
2008-03-23T01:31:00.000Z	Deusdies	saminthemiddle	but it used to work! Chipset is SAA7131
2008-03-23T01:31:00.000Z	saminthemiddle	Deusdies	hmm, have you tried to manually modprobe the modules?
2008-03-23T01:32:00.000Z	Deusdies	saminthemiddle	yes. I've tried modprobe saa7134 card=65 tuner=54, no success
2008-03-23T01:33:00.000Z	Deusdies	saminthemiddle	the problem is that LSPCI does NOT list my card...
2008-03-23T01:33:00.000Z	saminthemiddle	Deusdies	ooh, that's interesting
2008-03-23T01:34:00.000Z	saminthemiddle	Deusdies	because LSPCI should show ALL PCI cards whether or not they are supported
2008-03-23T01:34:00.000Z	saminthemiddle	Deusdies	maybe you have a dead card, sometimes they break
2008-03-23T01:36:00.000Z	Deusdies	saminthemiddle	one Q: if I have SAA7131 Philips chipset, do I have to use BTTV or no?
2008-03-23T01:37:00.000Z	saminthemiddle	Deusdies	sorry, I'm not familiar with the chipset
2008-03-23T01:39:00.000Z	saminthemiddle	Deusdies	PCI cards are NOT hot-swappable
2008-03-23T01:39:00.000Z	saminthemiddle	Deusdies	never remove those things with power on, you can seriously damage them
2008-03-23T01:39:00.000Z	saminthemiddle	Deusdies	no prob
2008-03-23T01:40:00.000Z	saminthemiddle	Deusdies	* unless you're ultra geeky and have figured out how to control power and signal to them with fancy BIOS and kernel stuff (I know some servers can hot-swap PCI cards, but your computer isn't one of them)
2008-03-23T01:41:00.000Z	saminthemiddle	Deusdies	anyway, night
