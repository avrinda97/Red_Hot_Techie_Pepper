2009-12-31T02:05:00.000Z	Milp		Is there a signal i can send to a process to restart it?
2009-12-31T02:05:00.000Z	ikonia	Milp	-HUP
2009-12-31T02:09:00.000Z	ikonia	Milp	try it on the localhost
2009-12-31T02:09:00.000Z	ikonia	Milp	ssh localhost
2009-12-31T02:10:00.000Z	ikonia	Milp	then how do you know ssh is running ?
2009-12-31T02:10:00.000Z	Milp	ikonia	i have a webinterface that is always online that lets me see processes and some other basic things and sshd is running
2009-12-31T02:10:00.000Z	ikonia	Milp	what is the web interface ?
2009-12-31T02:10:00.000Z	ikonia	Milp	then that web interface would appear wrong - or there is something blocking you
2009-12-31T02:11:00.000Z	ikonia	Milp	can you connect to port 22 on the target machine with telnet ?
2009-12-31T02:11:00.000Z	Milp	ikonia	its parallels power panel
2009-12-31T02:11:00.000Z	Milp	ikonia	telnet on 22? not 23?
2009-12-31T02:11:00.000Z	ikonia	Milp	apologies, 23
2009-12-31T02:12:00.000Z	ikonia	Milp	is this a "container" or a physical machine install ?
2009-12-31T02:12:00.000Z	ikonia	Milp	ok, then the host networking maybe down
2009-12-31T02:13:00.000Z	ikonia	Milp	that situation ssh could be running on the guest, but the host network being unavailable stops it
2009-12-31T02:13:00.000Z	ikonia	Milp	ahh, sshd probably needs restarting if ssl has been updated or libpcap
2009-12-31T02:13:00.000Z	ikonia	Milp	yup, that would make sense
2009-12-31T02:13:00.000Z	Milp	ikonia	hm i already restarted like thrice :/
2009-12-31T02:14:00.000Z	Milp	ikonia	ill just try again, maybe something changed now *prays*
