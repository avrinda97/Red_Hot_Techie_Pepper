2010-07-14T05:15:00.000Z	coz_		acidchild,  there is a utility named  Dban you can download and burn to disk
2010-07-14T05:15:00.000Z	Jordan_U	coz_	I think dban is overkill in this case.
2010-08-20T07:00:00.000Z	Jordan_U	coz_	Defrag is not required before resizing ntfs.
2010-08-20T07:00:00.000Z	coz_	Jordan_U	 I understand
2010-10-23T15:35:00.000Z	coz_	Jordan_U	 ah ok  cool
2010-11-16T11:25:00.000Z	Jordan_U	coz_	It does not (unless you specifically ask it to). It uses the free space on the existing filesystem.
2010-11-16T11:25:00.000Z	coz_	Jordan_U	 ah ok
2010-11-16T11:25:00.000Z	coz_	Jordan_U	 I havent used it frequently enough to remember

2011-05-03T22:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	coz_	Unetbootin is named as such because (IIRC) the netboot images (like mini.iso) are particularly easy to boot from USB :)
2011-05-03T22:03:00.000Z	coz_	Jordan_U	  ok I will try that,, it certainly will be an advantage :)
2011-09-08T00:48:00.000Z	Jordan_U	coz_	It
2011-09-08T00:49:00.000Z	Jordan_U	coz_	... It's dishonest to waste peoples time by lying about which distribution you are using. Please don't suggest that people do so.
2011-09-08T00:49:00.000Z	coz_	Jordan_U	 yes I thought that would be an issue  ,, thanks for pointing that out
2011-11-07T06:38:00.000Z	Jordan_U	coz_	gksudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
