2006-06-02T07:36:00.000Z	jworr		I just posted it
2006-06-02T07:37:00.000Z	jworr		here is my old one http://gnomefreak.pastebin.com/752612
2006-06-02T07:38:00.000Z	jworr		still did not work
2006-06-02T07:38:00.000Z	jworr		apt tries to connect to 127.0.0.1
2006-06-02T07:38:00.000Z	jworr		but when I boot into single user mode it works fine
2006-06-02T07:38:00.000Z	jworr		nope
2006-06-02T07:39:00.000Z	jworr		no proxy
2006-06-02T07:39:00.000Z	jworr		and synaptic doesn't work either
2006-06-02T07:39:00.000Z	jworr		none
2006-06-02T07:41:00.000Z	jworr		I think it is problem with sudo
2006-06-02T07:41:00.000Z	SEJeff	jworr	What is your problem again? This channel is too fast
2006-06-02T07:41:00.000Z	SEJeff	jworr	echo $http_proxy
2006-06-02T07:43:00.000Z	SEJeff	jworr	That is the problem. You do have a proxy set up
2006-06-02T07:44:00.000Z	SEJeff	jworr	So we know the problem, and now we need to figure out how to solve it. Just a second.
2006-06-02T07:46:00.000Z	SEJeff	jworr	Try running this: unset http_proxy
2006-06-02T07:47:00.000Z	SEJeff	jworr	What shell are you using? unset is a bash builtin command
2006-06-02T07:48:00.000Z	SEJeff	jworr	What did?
2006-06-02T07:48:00.000Z	SEJeff	jworr	I knew that was the problem as soon as you said it :)
2006-06-02T07:49:00.000Z	SEJeff	jworr	no problem
