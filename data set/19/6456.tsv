2010-08-05T21:06:00.000Z	scott__		I have an issue with xorg that I can't seem to solve. First, I have no xorg.conf file anywhere on my system, and when I try to run xorg -configure I get told to basically go fish. Can someone please help me?
2010-08-05T21:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	scott__	run: Xorg --configure    in a root recovery console, should be fine
2010-08-05T22:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	scott__	then try websearching what is said..
2010-08-05T22:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	scott__	you can use this guide to make the boot use the framebuffer driver: http://www.namanb.com/2010/05/changing-bootup-resolution-plymouth-in-ubuntu-10-04-lucid-lynx.html
2010-08-05T22:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	scott__	hold shift at boot, then select recovery mode, then select root
2010-08-05T22:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	scott__	it  is, scroll down off the bottom of the menu
2011-03-26T04:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	scott__	both will be available in natty but unity will be default, natty is discussed and supported in #ubuntu+1
2012-02-03T22:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	scott__	add ppa then refresh packages, you can then install it like any other package
2012-02-03T22:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	scott__	sudo add-apt-repository ppa:stebbins/handbrake-releases; sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install handbrake
2012-02-03T22:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	scott__	what is the output of:  lsb_release -sc
2012-02-03T22:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	scott__	the PPA supports that release
2012-02-03T22:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	scott__	there is nothing to 'click' you need the command I ave
2012-02-03T22:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	scott__	all you have to do is copy and paste the command I gave and it will install the app...
2012-02-03T22:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	scott__	no idea where you go the idea you click something
2012-02-03T23:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	scott__	can you give a pastebin of the output please
2012-02-03T23:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	scott__	did the ppa add ok?
2012-02-03T23:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	scott__	then run:  sudo apt-get install handbrake-cli
2012-02-03T23:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	scott__	that too
2012-02-03T23:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	scott__	got the PPA added though :)
