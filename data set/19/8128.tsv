2007-05-06T08:30:00.000Z	justinellison		all: where do I go to see if someone if working on making an Ubuntu package for a certain product?
2007-05-06T08:31:00.000Z	justinellison		I'm pretty sure...its called wgetpro
2007-05-06T08:32:00.000Z	thoreauputic	justinellison	install mimms
2007-05-06T08:33:00.000Z	thoreauputic	justinellison	also mplayer has a -dumpstream flag and it can handle mms streams
2007-05-06T08:34:00.000Z	justinellison	thoreauputic	 thanks for the recommendation...I'll check it out
2007-05-06T08:39:00.000Z	thoreauputic	justinellison	no need - recovery mode gives root prompt by default
2007-05-06T08:40:00.000Z	justinellison	thoreauputic	 how do you get to "recovery mode"
2007-05-06T08:40:00.000Z	thoreauputic	justinellison	hit <esc> on boot, select recovery mode from the grub menu
2007-05-06T08:41:00.000Z	justinellison	thoreauputic	 thanks,  I've never actually tried that...isn't that a little unsecure to have that option available to easily
2007-05-06T08:42:00.000Z	thoreauputic	justinellison	well, anyone with physical access to the machine can boot single user anyway
2007-05-06T08:43:00.000Z	justinellison	thoreauputic	 that's true...it just seems a little obvious...I guess anyone who would know how to harm you computer anyways would already know how to boot into so manually
2007-05-06T08:44:00.000Z	thoreauputic	justinellison	or just boot a live CD and chroot into the install on disc
2007-05-06T08:44:00.000Z	thoreauputic	justinellison	there are multiple ways, as always
2007-05-06T08:46:00.000Z	justinellison	thoreauputic	 why do modern Linux versions even have the so option anyways?
2007-05-06T08:47:00.000Z	thoreauputic	justinellison	I have no idea :) I'm just a user, not a dev
2007-05-06T08:47:00.000Z	justinellison	thoreauputic	 thanks
2007-05-06T08:48:00.000Z	thoreauputic	justinellison	but as I said, chroot can do pretty much the same thing
2007-05-06T08:49:00.000Z	justinellison	thoreauputic	 that's true, but you'd at least need to have a liveCD handy
2007-05-06T08:49:00.000Z	thoreauputic	justinellison	all you need really is either a floppy ( tomsrootboot) or a live CD, yes
