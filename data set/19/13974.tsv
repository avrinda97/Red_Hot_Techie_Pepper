2004-11-27T15:45:00.000Z	makonaima		Hi all.  I'm an absolute noob to ubuntu.  downloaded it last night and have it up and running.  In the Applications | System Tools menu, I don't see Services.  Any idea what I'm missing?
2004-11-27T15:46:00.000Z	GammaRay	makonaima	the services gui is missing from warty.. you will probably have to do it manually.
2004-11-27T15:47:00.000Z	GammaRay	makonaima	lemme pull up a little howto
2004-11-27T15:48:00.000Z	GammaRay	makonaima	http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/From-PowerUp-To-Bash-Prompt-HOWTO.html
2004-11-27T15:49:00.000Z	GammaRay	makonaima	that explains the basic structure of "services" on sysv style linux systems (everyone but slackware)
2004-11-27T16:01:00.000Z	makonaima	GammaRay	 I'm completely lost. Looked hi and lo on the URL you sent me - nothing about Services GUI.  Another cloe please?
2004-11-27T16:03:00.000Z	GammaRay	makonaima	the init section explains
2004-11-27T16:03:00.000Z	GammaRay	makonaima	services are scripts in /etc/init.d/
2004-11-27T16:04:00.000Z	GammaRay	makonaima	for them to be booted at startup.. sumbolic links from /etc/init.d/ are placeed in /etc/rcS.d
2004-11-27T16:05:00.000Z	GammaRay	makonaima	all the symbolic links that start w/ S are started, all the ones that start w/ K are stopped
2004-11-27T16:06:00.000Z	GammaRay	makonaima	the number after the first character is the order
2004-11-27T16:07:00.000Z	makonaima	GammaRay	 Thanks.  I'm working on it.
2004-11-27T16:07:00.000Z	GammaRay	makonaima	update-rc.d is the command line program that halps you manage them. you can gets it's manual w/ the command man update-rc.d
2004-11-27T16:08:00.000Z	GammaRay	makonaima	I'm a little suprised that the gui is missing though, but this is always nice to know
2004-11-27T16:10:00.000Z	GammaRay	makonaima	ubuntu is bebian based btw, so that's a good refrrence point
2004-11-27T16:10:00.000Z	GammaRay	makonaima	gah.. debian based I mean
2004-11-27T16:10:00.000Z	makonaima	GammaRay	 Everything else worked so smoothly.  But I can't stop and start services.  I also can't manage www and FTP services, so I got a bit frustrated.  Love the product.  It's all new as I said, so it's exciting.
2004-11-27T16:12:00.000Z	GammaRay	makonaima	a quick tip is this.. you can run the services in /etc/init.d/ w/ the arguments stop, start or status
2004-11-27T16:14:00.000Z	GammaRay	makonaima	I'm afraid I have to run off.. if you have any questions.. email me.. (I'll pm you the address)
