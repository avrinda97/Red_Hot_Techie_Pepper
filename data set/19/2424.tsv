2010-05-05T04:02:00.000Z	TommyThaGun	thebruce	what was it you changed?
2010-05-05T04:04:00.000Z	TommyThaGun	thebruce	this thread talks about the proper way to change them: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1469475
2010-05-05T04:05:00.000Z	TommyThaGun	thebruce	if you do that that page says to fix it, then it should be okay. basically you will be creating a new theme
2010-05-05T04:06:00.000Z	thebruce	TommyThaGun	also i see in the settings i can change the number of workspaces. i changed it to 7 but nothing happend
2010-05-05T04:07:00.000Z	TommyThaGun	thebruce	I don't know anything about the number of workstations... I think there are several different ways to change the number of them, so I wonder if one overrides another. I don't know where the proper place that change that is
2010-05-05T04:08:00.000Z	TommyThaGun	thebruce	yeah, I know you can control it in compiz properly
2010-05-05T04:09:00.000Z	thebruce	TommyThaGun	do you know where that option is compiz might be?
2010-05-05T04:10:00.000Z	TommyThaGun	thebruce	not off the top of my head. I currently am not using compiz
2010-05-05T04:10:00.000Z	thebruce	TommyThaGun	ahh ok are you using Gnome?
2010-05-05T04:15:00.000Z	thebruce	TommyThaGun	that theme method did not work
2010-05-05T04:25:00.000Z	TommyThaGun	thebruce	did you get it fixed?
2010-05-05T04:27:00.000Z	TommyThaGun	thebruce	I can tell you that my value for button_layout at apps/metacity/general is "close,minimize,maximize:"
2010-05-05T04:32:00.000Z	TommyThaGun	thebruce	did you see what I said a minute ago?
