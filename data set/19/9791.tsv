2008-08-07T01:27:00.000Z	creature		Hello. I installed Ubuntu on my laptop this afternoon from a USB key courtesy of unetbootin. However, my new install will now not boot without the USB key being present. How do I fix this?
2008-08-07T01:28:00.000Z	creature		I guess I need to adjust the grub config and re-install it on my / partition.
2008-08-07T01:28:00.000Z	ikonia	creature	grub goes on your boot sector not your / partition
2008-08-07T01:29:00.000Z	creature	ikonia	OK. Well, right now it seems to be on the USB key.
2008-08-07T01:29:00.000Z	ikonia	creature	pardon ?
2008-08-07T01:29:00.000Z	creature	ikonia	If the laptop has the USB key plugged in, it boots. If it does not have it plugged in, it does not ('Error 24' at stage 1.5, IIRC).
2008-08-07T01:30:00.000Z	ikonia	creature	yes, thats a common issue
2008-08-07T01:31:00.000Z	creature	ikonia	OK. How do I fix it?
2008-08-07T01:31:00.000Z	ikonia	creature	install grub to the mbr of your root hard disk
2008-08-07T01:34:00.000Z	creature	ikonia	Do I have to adjust the hd(X,X) points?
2008-08-07T01:34:00.000Z	ikonia	creature	correct
2008-08-07T01:35:00.000Z	creature	ikonia	OK. To what?
2008-08-07T01:35:00.000Z	ikonia	creature	what ever your root file system is
2008-08-07T01:35:00.000Z	ikonia	creature	is ubuntu installed on the usb stick
2008-08-07T01:35:00.000Z	creature	ikonia	No, it's on the HD.
2008-08-07T01:36:00.000Z	creature	ikonia	I have no idea how I find out what the correct numbers are for grub.
2008-08-07T01:36:00.000Z	ikonia	creature	if you open your /boot/grub/device.map you'll see the hd->/dev mapping
2008-08-07T01:38:00.000Z	creature	ikonia	How do I install grub on a given device?
2008-08-07T01:38:00.000Z	ikonia	creature	check out the link from ubottu
