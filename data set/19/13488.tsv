2005-06-29T05:07:00.000Z	rodimus		guys, i really like to get to learn linux, i heard ubuntu is a fine first choice
2005-06-29T05:07:00.000Z	rodimus		is that true
2005-06-29T05:07:00.000Z	rodimus		and will it run on my 333 mhz 192 ram?
2005-06-29T05:07:00.000Z	PoopinClumpin	rodimus	yeah, but it will be slow
2005-06-29T05:08:00.000Z	rodimus		thats too bad
2005-06-29T05:08:00.000Z	rodimus		hmm
2005-06-29T05:08:00.000Z	rodimus		you all say different things, i mean, gnome is the most fancy one
2005-06-29T05:08:00.000Z	rodimus		and i like to keep it fancy ;)
2005-06-29T05:08:00.000Z	rodimus		but you all believe gnome will run slow on it?
2005-06-29T05:09:00.000Z	rodimus		and kde is faster than gnome?
2005-06-29T05:09:00.000Z	PoopinClumpin		i believe the default ubuntu install will run slw on it. im sure there are many ways to increase the performance on a 333mhz box
2005-06-29T05:10:00.000Z	rodimus		ah , can one choose among these when installing?
2005-06-29T05:10:00.000Z	rodimus		i have no clue how to tweak linux so i hoped it would run pretty ok from the start
2005-06-29T05:11:00.000Z	rodimus		does the live cd give a decent impression of ubuntu?
2005-06-29T05:11:00.000Z	PoopinClumpin	rodimus	it will run, and you will be able to use it. but a faster processor and more ram would be needed to get good performance
2005-06-29T05:11:00.000Z	PoopinClumpin		if you dont mind waiting a split second for dropdown menus and cmboboxes to appear then you wont have a problem
2005-06-29T05:11:00.000Z	rodimus		damn, win xp runs fine, i thought ubuntu would run even faster
2005-06-29T05:12:00.000Z	rodimus	flankk	really? i've downlaoded the live cd, gonna burn it in the morning and try it out
2005-06-29T05:12:00.000Z	PoopinClumpin	rodimus	every machine is different though. you should probably just try it out and see how it works before you start making choices
