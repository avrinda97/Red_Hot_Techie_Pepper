2006-02-25T15:40:00.000Z	asymmetry		net||abuse: did you overwrite the mbr on the boot drive?
2006-02-25T15:41:00.000Z	NET||abuse	asymmetry	so i had to load grub into the mbr on the /dev/sda which is the sata
2006-02-25T15:43:00.000Z	NET||abuse	asymmetry	neither will now boot
2006-02-25T15:43:00.000Z	NET||abuse	asymmetry	basically it's cacked both OS's
2006-02-25T15:44:00.000Z	NET||abuse	asymmetry	i'm havin a minor freak out now.. i've ballsed up my pc ;S
2006-02-25T15:44:00.000Z	NET||abuse	asymmetry	is it worth trying to get the boot commands cause i think it's mixed up the two drives in the boot up.
2006-02-25T15:45:00.000Z	NET||abuse	asymmetry	when i boot xp it's saying Filesystem type is ext2fs
2006-02-25T15:45:00.000Z	NET||abuse	asymmetry	so that sounds like it's looking at the ubuntu install??
2006-02-25T15:45:00.000Z	NET||abuse	asymmetry	it is.
2006-02-25T15:46:00.000Z	NET||abuse	asymmetry	but somehow it's detecting ext2fs with the seleciton of xp
2006-02-25T15:46:00.000Z	NET||abuse	asymmetry	it's calling hd1 and hd0
2006-02-25T15:47:00.000Z	NET||abuse	asymmetry	so i take it hd0 is trying to mount up that drive?
2006-02-25T15:48:00.000Z	NET||abuse	asymmetry	yeh, so i'm write, somereason it's screwed up the drive allocation :)
2006-02-25T15:49:00.000Z	NET||abuse	asymmetry	umm, s/write/right/ :S oops
2006-02-25T15:50:00.000Z	NET||abuse	asymmetry	ok, so i need to fix it for my windows setup next :)
2006-02-25T15:51:00.000Z	NET||abuse	asymmetry	yeh, but it's not intended to be messed with that much :)
2006-02-25T15:58:00.000Z	NET||abuse	asymmetry	sweet good call :)
2006-02-25T15:59:00.000Z	NET||abuse	asymmetry	one more question about the grub commands, in the xp boot, it starts with root (hd1,0) then 2 lines down it has map (hd0) (hd1)\n map (hd1) (hd0)
2006-02-25T16:01:00.000Z	NET||abuse	asymmetry	i mean getting it wrong..
