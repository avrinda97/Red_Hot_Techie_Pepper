2009-12-24T20:32:00.000Z	Diverdude		hmm did anybody in here have success on using skype on ubuntu?
2009-12-24T20:32:00.000Z	maco	Diverdude	mostly... my webcam turns out not to work, but otherwise, yes
2009-12-24T20:34:00.000Z	Diverdude	maco	Any ideas on that?
2009-12-24T20:34:00.000Z	maco	Diverdude	possibly a sound driver bug. can you use the mic otherwise?
2009-12-24T20:35:00.000Z	Diverdude	maco	i didnt actually ever use the mic since i installed ubuntu
2009-12-24T20:35:00.000Z	maco	Diverdude	try gnome-sound-recorder in the audio/video part of the menu
2010-08-21T21:02:00.000Z	maco	Diverdude	find . -name *.m
2010-08-21T21:04:00.000Z	Diverdude	maco	that gives error: find: paths must precede expression: Analysis.m
2010-08-21T21:04:00.000Z	maco	Diverdude	weird. try "find ./ -name *.m"
2010-12-20T18:09:00.000Z	maco	Diverdude	du -csh
2010-12-20T18:11:00.000Z	Diverdude	maco	thx
2011-04-25T22:48:00.000Z	maco	Diverdude	id try that sftp in terminal too for a better comparison. id guess nautilus has some overhead
2011-04-25T22:49:00.000Z	Diverdude	maco	lol it has 10xoverhead in transfer speed just to show some gui crap?
2011-04-25T22:49:00.000Z	maco	Diverdude	when you create a remote filesystem through nautilus....its actually mounting a remote filesystem, not just adding "some gui crap"
2011-04-25T22:49:00.000Z	maco	Diverdude	there's an extra layer of indirection in your ~/.gnomevfs
2011-04-25T22:50:00.000Z	maco	Diverdude	so yeah, i wouldnt be surprised if it created a LOT of overhead.  copying files locally is slower through nautilus or dolphin than through the command line, IME
2011-04-25T22:51:00.000Z	Diverdude	maco	hmmm okay that really is is quite bad for linux i guess if it has to compete with windows gui copy which does not have such overhead
2011-04-25T22:52:00.000Z	maco	Diverdude	does windows have a non-gui copy?
2011-04-25T22:52:00.000Z	Diverdude	maco	yeah it has xcopy
