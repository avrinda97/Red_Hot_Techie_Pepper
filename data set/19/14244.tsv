2004-10-19T09:37:00.000Z	Jaramin		in the same line of thought as grue_, I don't think doing sudo all the time ia a good answer, it's tedious. I'm learning linux, I want to be able to fiddle with things easily. Coming from the windows world, I'm used to have all permissions on my machine...
2004-10-19T09:37:00.000Z	Jaramin		so, is there a way to grant priviliges to a user so that he can edit any files he sees in nautilus?
2004-10-19T09:39:00.000Z	Jaramin		jgeorgson: I know, but I don't want to run just a shell, in fact I want to avoid it :P I want that, from the moment I log in, I can edit any config file I see in nautilus by double clicking on it's icon.
2004-10-19T09:40:00.000Z	whiprush	Jaramin	don't think in windows. ;)
2004-10-19T09:42:00.000Z	Jaramin	whiprush	well, I do want to "think in windows", as it's natural for me, and since I'm leraning linux, I want to muck aroubd with stuff a lot, and if I break my system, well, boohoo, that's the way I'll learn :)
2004-10-19T09:42:00.000Z	whiprush	Jaramin	yeah, that's like the first step though, heh.
2004-10-19T09:44:00.000Z	whiprush	Jaramin	heh, this might kind sound of lame. But after I got used to the linux way, I started running my windows stuff the same way.
2004-10-19T10:07:00.000Z	Jaramin	whiprush	the computer will only be used by me, it's my home computer. The "run as" an idea, but still tedious... is it possible *at all* in linux for a user different than root, from the moment they log on, to be able to access any file as root would through the GUI? that's what I want to know.
2004-10-19T10:08:00.000Z	whiprush	Jaramin	I swear to you man, after you install, you'll need root access like, 5% of the time. Really.
2004-10-19T10:10:00.000Z	Jaramin	whiprush	not really, I'll be changing config files dayly, trying stuff, testing stuff...
2004-10-19T10:10:00.000Z	whiprush	Jaramin	you can do 90% of that as a user.
2004-10-19T11:38:00.000Z	Jaramin	whiprush	I've taken a closer look to the linux permission system, and understand a bit more the orientation of your previous answers ;)
2004-10-19T11:39:00.000Z	whiprush	Jaramin	excellent.
2004-10-19T11:39:00.000Z	whiprush	Jaramin	windows is the same way also. Learn about fast user switching. Same idea.
2004-10-19T11:40:00.000Z	whiprush	Jaramin	don't think of it as a cage. Think of it as a seatbelt.
2004-10-19T11:41:00.000Z	Jaramin	whiprush	so I'll ask for something that would probably be more fitting, though I'm not sure it's easily feasible... let's say I'm in a folder in nautilus. I want to delete a file, but need to be root to do so. I don't want to use the command line (even if I can). Would it be possible to add some sort of "delete as root" button or context menu entry?
2004-10-19T11:43:00.000Z	Jaramin	whiprush	log files. I'm using ipac-ng and I need to delete log files.
2004-10-19T11:45:00.000Z	whiprush	Jaramin	admin function. For that you'll need to sudo to. The "right way" is to set it up so it rotates properly, do you don't need to delete by hand.
2004-10-19T11:45:00.000Z	Jaramin	whiprush	I guess it would be harder to really integrate it as clee said, but how about a just some sort of "delete as root" context entry, is it something I could make myslef?
