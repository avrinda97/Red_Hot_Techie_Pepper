2008-07-08T00:49:00.000Z	Chaotic_Descent		How do I change my Ubuntu login name? I seem to be able to change the real name, but not the account name.
2008-07-08T00:50:00.000Z	Chousuke	Chaotic_Descent	hmmh
2008-07-08T00:50:00.000Z	Chousuke	Chaotic_Descent	that requires editing some files in a way that you could mess up real bad :P
2008-07-08T00:51:00.000Z	Chousuke	Chaotic_Descent	easier just to create a new user and move over your files :)
2008-07-08T00:51:00.000Z	Chaotic_Descent	Chousuke	great. :S I just wish I'd known things like IRC would start using my username in my whois.
2008-07-08T00:51:00.000Z	Chousuke	Chaotic_Descent	heh
2008-07-08T00:55:00.000Z	Chaotic_Descent	Chousuke	is it difficult to copy over the files from one account into another?
2008-07-08T00:57:00.000Z	Chousuke	Chaotic_Descent	create new user, make yourself root, rm -rf /home/newuser; cp -r /home/olduser /home/newuser; chown -R newuser:newuser /home/newuser
2008-07-08T00:57:00.000Z	Chousuke	Chaotic_Descent	that copies the files; you can also use mv, but that may mess up your old user
2008-07-08T00:57:00.000Z	Chousuke	Chaotic_Descent	if you make a mistake
2008-07-08T00:58:00.000Z	Chaotic_Descent	Chousuke	I was reading something about chown. that works?
2008-07-08T00:58:00.000Z	Chousuke	Chaotic_Descent	chown changes file ownership
2008-07-08T00:58:00.000Z	Chousuke	Chaotic_Descent	your new user must own the files in his homedir :P
2008-07-08T00:59:00.000Z	Chousuke	Chaotic_Descent	yes, but once you've copied them and changed owner on the copied files, you can remove the old user and his files.
2008-07-08T01:00:00.000Z	Chousuke	Chaotic_Descent	make sure you make your new user an admin too though :)
2008-07-08T01:00:00.000Z	Chousuke	Chaotic_Descent	otherwise you'll lose access to sudo if you delete the old user
2008-07-08T01:00:00.000Z	Chousuke	Chaotic_Descent	"admin" doesn't mean root
2008-07-08T01:01:00.000Z	Chousuke	Chaotic_Descent	any user who is able to use sudo is "admin"
2008-07-08T01:01:00.000Z	Chousuke	Chaotic_Descent	what did you do?
