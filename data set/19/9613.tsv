2006-10-15T09:54:00.000Z	felixflores86		does anyone know how to setup up the permissions on an external hd so that i can read and write on it even if its on ntfs format
2006-10-15T09:55:00.000Z	felixflores86		thanks guys
2006-10-15T09:55:00.000Z	felixflores86		I have another problem
2006-10-15T09:57:00.000Z	felixflores86		my friend is trying to install ubuntu to his machine, but his cd rom drive doesn't work so we copies the ubuntu image into my external hd. Then we try to boot of my external hd and we got a pxe-e61 error (media test failure)
2006-10-15T09:58:00.000Z	felixflores86		oh
2006-10-15T09:59:00.000Z	felixflores86		no
2006-10-15T09:59:00.000Z	felixflores86		it broke
2006-10-15T09:59:00.000Z	felixflores86		so we copied the ubuntu image on the root directory of the hd to make it act like the cd
2006-10-15T10:00:00.000Z	felixflores86		but that didnt work
2006-10-15T10:01:00.000Z	felixflores86		is there a way to trick the system to thinking that my external hd is a cdrom drive
2006-10-15T10:01:00.000Z	adamh	felixflores86	What do you mean by that? What do you want to do specifically?
2006-10-15T10:02:00.000Z	adamh	felixflores86	There's certainly a way to do it (most likely leaving the CD as an ISO)...
2006-10-15T10:06:00.000Z	adamh	felixflores86	Do you have a floppy drive? :)
2006-10-15T10:07:00.000Z	adamh	felixflores86	Are you in Windows, or in another Linux/UNIX distribution?
2006-10-15T10:07:00.000Z	adamh	felixflores86	Do you have a USB key? :)
2006-10-15T10:08:00.000Z	adamh	felixflores86	Okay... and the CD drive doesn't work *at all*? Or it's just not booting?
2006-10-15T10:09:00.000Z	adamh	felixflores86	Anyway, there's some sort of advice at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SmartBootManagerHowto for booting without the CD (booting is the hardest part, mounting is easy after you're booted)
2006-10-15T10:10:00.000Z	adamh	felixflores86	Ooh, actually, https://wiki.ubuntu.com/InstallationUbuntuFromWindows?highlight=%28install%29
2006-10-15T10:10:00.000Z	felixflores86	adamh	ok let me read this
