2005-05-12T11:06:00.000Z	IcemanV9		why? why? why _only_ RAW blank CD-RW disc works?! it cannot be erased! i've tried gnomebaker, k3b & natuilus; nothing cannot be erased. :-(
2005-05-12T11:06:00.000Z	bob2	IcemanV9	use cdrecord
2005-05-12T11:08:00.000Z	IcemanV9	bob2	is this command correct? cdrecord blank=fast dev=/dev/hdc
2005-05-12T11:09:00.000Z	bob2	IcemanV9	looks ok
2005-05-12T11:12:00.000Z	IcemanV9	bob2	oy. it doesn't work. cannot blank disc, aborted. *sigh* thanks for the hint.
2005-06-08T10:43:00.000Z	bob2	IcemanV9	it's supposed to be slightly faster, but I don't know if it is usefully quicker.  you can try it and see...
2005-06-16T10:05:00.000Z	bob2	IcemanV9	it's not buggy in general, just on some hardware...
2005-06-16T10:06:00.000Z	IcemanV9	bob2	ur right. i didn't add to it. :)
2005-06-20T09:14:00.000Z	bob2	IcemanV9	nothing is wrong with it
2005-06-20T09:14:00.000Z	bob2	IcemanV9	us.archive is screwed
2005-07-24T15:32:00.000Z	bob2	IcemanV9	no
2005-09-18T10:24:00.000Z	bob2	IcemanV9	networkmanager is in breezy
2005-09-21T08:08:00.000Z	bob2	IcemanV9	no
2005-09-21T08:09:00.000Z	IcemanV9	bob2	why not??
2005-09-21T08:09:00.000Z	bob2	IcemanV9	because!!1111
2005-09-21T08:09:00.000Z	bob2	IcemanV9	hoary is a stable release. stable = doesn't change
2005-09-21T08:12:00.000Z	IcemanV9	bob2	alright, whatever. i still think it should be merged into hoary repos when it is stable. :P
2005-09-21T08:13:00.000Z	bob2	IcemanV9	that would be silly and pointless work
2005-09-21T08:13:00.000Z	bob2	IcemanV9	that effort would be wasted, when it could go into just making breezy better
