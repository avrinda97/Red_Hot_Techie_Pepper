2009-09-27T16:08:00.000Z	JonathanEllis		My /tmp directory is getting cluttered. Is it safe to set my machine to empty /tmp on shutdown?
2009-09-27T16:09:00.000Z	grawity	JonathanEllis	Isn't that done automatically?
2009-09-27T16:10:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	grawity	Dont know. Where would I find that option?
2009-09-27T16:10:00.000Z	grawity	JonathanEllis	Actually, it's done on boot, if I remember correctly.
2009-09-27T16:11:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	grawity	How would I check this?
2009-09-27T16:16:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	grawity	I have just rebooted and /tmp has not been emptied. Would it be dangerous to set it up to do that
2009-09-27T16:18:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	grawity	Actually I say it has not been emptied. It is more correct to say it is not empty, but I notice one file that was there has gone so maybe it was emptied and the other files have been newly written. I just checked the dates on the files and they are all after the reboot
2009-09-27T18:04:00.000Z	grawity	JonathanEllis	du -hs directory; echo $(find directory -type d | wc -l) directories; echo $(find directory -type f | wc -l) regular files; and so on.

2009-11-02T17:13:00.000Z	grawity	JonathanEllis	As for IRC accounts, that depends on your IRC client.
2009-11-02T17:15:00.000Z	grawity	JonathanEllis	come on, 7 millibits isn't that much.
2009-11-02T17:15:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	grawity	and JordanC: I was using pidgin but now Karmic uses Empathy. There is some migration wizard but I dont know how to start it
2009-11-02T17:15:00.000Z	grawity	JonathanEllis	If you want to continue using Pidgin -- there are instructions at http://pidgin.im/download/ubuntu, and your settings are in ~/.purple/
2009-11-02T17:16:00.000Z	grawity	JonathanEllis	I don't know about anything related to Empathy migration, sorry. (I'd stay with Pidgin, personally.)
2009-11-02T17:27:00.000Z	grawity	JonathanEllis	Get Pidgin and stop worrying.
2009-11-02T17:27:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	grawity	Yes but I need to find what you and jordan told me about it earlier!
2009-11-02T17:27:00.000Z	grawity	JonathanEllis	What would that be?
2009-11-02T17:28:00.000Z	grawity	JonathanEllis	If you're talking about ~/.purple -- open your homedir's backup, enable "Show Hidden Files", and look for a directory named ".purple"
2009-11-16T19:39:00.000Z	grawity	JonathanEllis	Zeroconf is a very different thing from samba/nfs. It's used for different purposes.
