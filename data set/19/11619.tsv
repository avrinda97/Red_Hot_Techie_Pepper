2005-12-21T12:18:00.000Z	Frosty		hi all
2005-12-21T12:18:00.000Z	Frosty		I'm having issues, anyone willing to help out a noob
2005-12-21T12:18:00.000Z	yubimusubi	Frosty	that's what everyone's here for ^-^
2005-12-21T12:20:00.000Z	yubimusubi	Frosty	Where's the folder? /usr/share/xmms/Skins/ ?
2005-12-21T12:20:00.000Z	yubimusubi	Frosty	what's 'ls -lh /usr/share/xmms/Skins/' return?
2005-12-21T12:21:00.000Z	yubimusubi	Frosty	~/.xmms/Skins also... That should be visible...
2005-12-21T12:21:00.000Z	yubimusubi	Frosty	cd ~/.xmms/Skins/
2005-12-21T12:22:00.000Z	yubimusubi	Frosty	Any file with a leading "." is hidden, but you still have read/write access to it...I don't know how to make it visible in nautilus though...prolly something like rt-click->show hidden files
2005-12-21T12:25:00.000Z	yubimusubi	Frosty	sorry 'ls -lh /usr/share/xmms/Skins'
2005-12-21T12:25:00.000Z	yubimusubi	Frosty	Don't put the slash at the end...that was my typo
2005-12-21T12:26:00.000Z	yubimusubi	Frosty	Oh, that doesn't work either...
2005-12-21T12:26:00.000Z	yubimusubi	Frosty	'ls -lh /usr/share/xmms/ | grep Skins'
2005-12-21T12:26:00.000Z	yubimusubi	Frosty	That should give you a single line
2005-12-21T12:27:00.000Z	yubimusubi	Frosty	Are you using 'cd' or nautilus?
2005-12-21T12:29:00.000Z	yubimusubi	Frosty	and you can't cd into that directory?
2005-12-21T12:30:00.000Z	yubimusubi	Frosty	That means that root has complete read/write/execute access and you only have read/execute access...what exactly are you trying to do?
2005-12-21T12:31:00.000Z	yubimusubi	Frosty	do 'sudo mv [path/to/folder/you/want/]  /usr/share/xmms/Skins/'
2005-12-21T12:59:00.000Z	Frosty	yubimusubi	it actualy didnot work at all, xmms thing that is... after I got the file to move it still did not load, come to find out xmms default path was pointing to a folder that did not exist, that is why it wasn't working properly. so I pointed it to the actual folders. all is working now. Damn I can be dumb sometimes
2005-12-21T12:59:00.000Z	yubimusubi	Frosty	Okay, glad you got it working ^-^
