2010-09-06T01:03:00.000Z	rolo		hello, I have installed ubuntu on my entire disk, without partitions. can I format the disk so that I can install windows 7 on it, and then install ubuntu 10.04 alongside with it?
2010-09-06T01:04:00.000Z	duffydack	rolo	use win7 to resize it to make a free partition space..
2010-09-06T01:05:00.000Z	duffydack	rolo	sorry didnt read properly.  ignore
2010-09-06T01:05:00.000Z	duffydack	rolo	you can install win7 after ubuntu, you just need to reinstall grub later on.
2010-09-06T01:06:00.000Z	duffydack	rolo	make free space first.
2010-09-06T01:06:00.000Z	rolo	duffydack	you mean a partition?
2010-09-06T01:08:00.000Z	duffydack	rolo	yes
2010-09-06T01:08:00.000Z	duffydack	rolo	if you dont care about the installation you have now then the best thing would be win7 first, then ubuntu......
2010-09-06T01:10:00.000Z	duffydack	rolo	 just resize your partition to make an empty partition for win to use
2010-09-06T01:11:00.000Z	duffydack	rolo	no need to format it.. just make it free and available
2010-09-06T01:11:00.000Z	duffydack	rolo	be advised you`ll need to boot a livecd to reinstall grub
2010-09-06T01:14:00.000Z	duffydack	rolo	you`ll need to run sudo grub-install /dev/sda  from a livecd.. and then boot into ubuntu and run sudo update-grub
2010-09-06T01:14:00.000Z	duffydack	rolo	then you`ll get windows in the grub menu.
2010-09-06T01:15:00.000Z	duffydack	rolo	assumiung sda is your hard drive of course.
2010-09-06T01:17:00.000Z	duffydack	rolo	backup your hd before you mess with it
2010-09-06T01:17:00.000Z	duffydack	rolo	if your data isnt important that is..
2010-09-06T01:19:00.000Z	duffydack	rolo	 looking at your partition table,  I`d probably install windows first and then ubuntu...if data isnt important.
2010-09-06T01:35:00.000Z	duffydack	rolo	I dont do DCC
2010-09-06T01:35:00.000Z	duffydack	rolo	imgur or something
