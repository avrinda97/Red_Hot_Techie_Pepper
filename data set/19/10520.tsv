2006-12-03T08:10:00.000Z	Zaggynl		Anyone knows a way to lower the volume with rhytmbox with the terminal? Right now I can only set it to a certain amount with 'rhythmbox --set-volume 0.8', and I want to turn it down by a bit with every keypress
2006-12-03T08:12:00.000Z	hastesaver	Zaggynl	wow, "--set-volume" doesn't work either for me. What are you using?
2006-12-03T08:13:00.000Z	Zaggynl	hastesaver	rhythmbox in dapper
2006-12-03T08:14:00.000Z	hastesaver	Zaggynl	and this feature was removed in edgy?!
2006-12-03T08:14:00.000Z	Zaggynl	hastesaver	can you try 'rhythmbox --volume-down' for me?
2006-12-03T08:15:00.000Z	hastesaver	Zaggynl	you could set it once, write the set value to a file, and write a script which takes the current volume level from the file, calculate the new value to set, and set it
2006-12-03T08:15:00.000Z	Zaggynl	hastesaver	yeah I thought about that too, it's dirty though <:
2006-12-03T08:15:00.000Z	hastesaver	Zaggynl	no it doesn't work for me. The default rhythmbox on edgy doesn't seem to have *any* features for manipulating an existing rhythmbox
2006-12-03T08:16:00.000Z	Zaggynl	hastesaver	what does 'rhythmbox --help' for you?
2006-12-03T08:18:00.000Z	hastesaver	Zaggynl	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35177/
2006-12-03T08:18:00.000Z	Zaggynl	hastesaver	 woot, thanks :D
2006-12-03T08:18:00.000Z	Zaggynl	hastesaver	try ' -help-all '
2006-12-03T08:20:00.000Z	hastesaver	Zaggynl	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35178/
2006-12-03T08:21:00.000Z	Zaggynl	hastesaver	indeed, it doesn't appear to be there, or we're looking at the wrong section of the help
2006-12-03T08:22:00.000Z	hastesaver	Zaggynl	I guess this is a warning to never upgrade to Edgy :-)
2006-12-03T08:23:00.000Z	hastesaver	Zaggynl	no, edgy is Ubuntu's latest *stable* release (since October)
2006-12-03T08:23:00.000Z	Zaggynl	hastesaver	as they say :(
2006-12-03T08:25:00.000Z	hastesaver	Zaggynl	it will be supported for the usual 18 months, IIRC. (Dapper for 3 years.)
2006-12-03T08:31:00.000Z	Zaggynl	hastesaver	meh, so far I haven't found anything as feature rich and light as utorrent
