2007-04-03T10:09:00.000Z	beg1689		frostwire has a ubuntu deb on their main site
2007-04-03T10:09:00.000Z	beg1689		if im not mistaken they are th exact same thing
2007-04-03T10:10:00.000Z	beg1689		(except on is blue)
2007-04-03T10:11:00.000Z	beg1689		so anyway.. how can i get my extra mouse buttons to work
2007-04-03T10:11:00.000Z	beg1689		i have one of those wheels that clicks left and right
2007-04-03T10:11:00.000Z	beg1689		but they dont even show up in xev :(
2007-04-03T10:13:00.000Z	hanbush	beg1689	do you have a link to the website? theres nothing on google, just some weird flash site
2007-04-03T10:13:00.000Z	beg1689		frostwire?
2007-04-03T10:13:00.000Z	beg1689		frostwire.com
2007-04-03T10:14:00.000Z	beg1689		it should autodetect ubuntu and give a .deb download link
2007-04-03T10:20:00.000Z	hanbush		how would i install java?
2007-04-03T10:21:00.000Z	hanbush		whats the name for apt-get
2007-04-03T10:25:00.000Z	hanbush	beg1689	frostwire crashes as soon as it opens
2007-04-03T10:25:00.000Z	hanbush		dabar: no error messages, just closes
2007-04-03T10:26:00.000Z	beg1689	hanbush	sorry forgot to mention that, on old versions of java, you will need to grab the previous version of frostwire; find the download link and change the last 6 to a 5
2007-04-03T10:26:00.000Z	beg1689		or install sun java6
2007-04-03T10:26:00.000Z	beg1689		either method fixed it for me
2007-04-03T10:27:00.000Z	hanbush	beg1689	im installing java6 now thanks
