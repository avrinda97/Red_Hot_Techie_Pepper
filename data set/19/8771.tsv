2007-02-10T12:46:00.000Z	jeffwheeler		so, what's the general concensus on the Linspire stuff?
2007-02-10T12:47:00.000Z	Flannel	jeffwheeler	that's a perfect question for #ubuntu-offtopic ;)  this is for support related chatter
2007-02-10T12:47:00.000Z	jeffwheeler	Flannel	ah, sorry!
2007-03-03T13:15:00.000Z	Flannel	jeffwheeler	you don't write C apps, you write either assembly or TI-basic
2007-03-03T13:15:00.000Z	jeffwheeler	Flannel	you sure? There's a TIGCC compilre available, so I assume the same can be done for lower-level calcs, right?
2007-03-03T13:16:00.000Z	Flannel	jeffwheeler	that's.. equivalent to writing assembly, I suppose.
2007-03-03T13:17:00.000Z	Flannel	jeffwheeler	I'm not sure the TI-84 has ASM hooks though.  I know the 85 didn't, that's why you had to use zshell to bootstrap
2007-03-03T13:20:00.000Z	Flannel	jeffwheeler	yeah, 84 has assembly support, or machine code support, that is.  You should be good.
2007-03-03T13:20:00.000Z	jeffwheeler	Flannel	alright, but I still don't see how I should be able to get it on there... :-/
2007-03-03T13:20:00.000Z	Flannel	jeffwheeler	shrug.  No idea.  I've got a serial cable ;)
2007-03-03T13:20:00.000Z	jeffwheeler	Flannel	ha, alright; thanks. I'll see what I can come up with.
2007-03-03T13:22:00.000Z	Flannel	jeffwheeler	DarkX, guarenteed you don't need to do that, It's already on the web somewhere.
2007-03-03T13:22:00.000Z	jeffwheeler	Flannel	DarkX: I see Tilp (and its dependencies) seem to have gone somewhere.
2007-03-03T13:22:00.000Z	Flannel	jeffwheeler	I imagine it's the exact same protocol theyve been using on that family.  Check for 83 and 82 protocols as well.
2007-03-03T13:23:00.000Z	jeffwheeler	Flannel	likely; will do
2007-03-03T13:23:00.000Z	Flannel	jeffwheeler	DarkX, this is offtopic though.  #ubuntu-offtopic if you have any more TI- stuff jeffwheeler ;)
2007-03-03T13:23:00.000Z	jeffwheeler	Flannel	no problem; thanks for your help
2009-03-29T09:57:00.000Z	Flannel	jeffwheeler	#ubuntu+1 for Jaunty questions/support/etc, Thanks
2009-03-29T09:57:00.000Z	jeffwheeler	Flannel	heh, thanks
