2006-09-16T10:23:00.000Z	thanksjack		same... I must be missing a source
2006-09-16T10:23:00.000Z	Hazarath	thanksjack	it worked before... I dis-connected the drive to take some info to another system, reading data only, now, the drive will not mount both partitions... partition 2 will mount, partition 1 will not.
2006-09-16T10:28:00.000Z	Hazarath	thanksjack	for whatever reason, 'sudo unmount -a' and 'sudo mount -a' worked, it usally doesn't.
2006-09-16T10:29:00.000Z	Hazarath	thanksjack	I NEVER saw it to work before, however. o.o;;;;
2006-09-16T10:29:00.000Z	Hazarath	thanksjack	I usally am _requred_ to re-boot. o.o;;;;;
2006-09-16T10:40:00.000Z	Hazarath	thanksjack	I can't open/save fstab, tried logging in as su via bash, still no good.
2006-09-16T10:44:00.000Z	Hazarath	thanksjack	now it doesn't let me write to it. -.-
2006-09-16T10:45:00.000Z	Hazarath	thanksjack	it will let me read/write to partition 2, but not partition 1
2006-09-16T10:46:00.000Z	Hazarath	thanksjack	that fixed... will this happen again?
2006-09-16T10:46:00.000Z	Hazarath	thanksjack	Okes... let's hope not, heh.
