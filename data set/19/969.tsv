2011-07-02T19:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ItalianGuy	did you boot to the ubuntu CD and install, or did you run a program on the Ubuntu CD from within windows?
2011-07-02T20:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ItalianGuy	so when you boot the liveCD you cannot see your drives?
2011-07-02T20:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ItalianGuy	have you fsck'd your partitions?
2011-07-02T20:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ItalianGuy	boot to the liveCD and you can ensure your Linux filesystems are healthy
2011-07-02T20:06:00.000Z	ItalianGuy	ActionParsnip	I am a Windows User
2011-07-02T20:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ItalianGuy	ahhh, so linux isn't installed yet?
2011-07-02T20:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ItalianGuy	fine, but does the Ubuntu CD not pick up your drives, just to clarify...
2011-07-02T20:11:00.000Z	ItalianGuy	ActionParsnip	Yes, exactly... my HDD is recognized by Ubunto as sda (HD1)
2011-07-02T20:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ItalianGuy	did you MD5 test the ISO you downloaded?
