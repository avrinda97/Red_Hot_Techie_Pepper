2011-03-09T09:07:00.000Z	adventure__		I just installed a new mobo and I can't seem to start x. I get the error messages "[drm] failed to open device" followed by "VESA(0): No valid modes" followed by "Screen(s) found, but none have a usable configuration". How can I debug this?

2011-03-09T09:11:00.000Z	adventure__	drobole	thanks. none of those solutions work though. also when it says "gdm is configured to help you configure your display when gdm fail to start", what is that supposed to mean?
2011-03-09T09:12:00.000Z	drobole	adventure__	well gdm is the login facility, i guess it means it is smart about helping you to get X configured if it doesnt work
2011-03-09T09:12:00.000Z	adventure__	drobole	hmm apparently not smart enough
2011-03-09T09:13:00.000Z	drobole	adventure__	 are you logged in as root?
2011-03-09T09:14:00.000Z	adventure__	drobole	no, I don't think this computer is configured with a root login
2011-03-09T09:15:00.000Z	drobole	adventure__	 you could look at the xorg.conf file and see what modes and drivers it tries to load
2011-03-09T09:16:00.000Z	adventure__	drobole	apparently my xorg.conf file is now empty. let me see if i have a backup
2011-03-09T09:17:00.000Z	adventure__	drobole	yeah, it's empty and i didn't make a backup. I thought that `sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg ` would create a new file from a template. apparently not in ubuntu 10.10

2011-03-09T09:19:00.000Z	adventure__	drobole	hah it would be nice if i could copy and paste, but the computer i'm talking about is beside me
2011-03-09T09:19:00.000Z	adventure__	drobole	let me type that in
2011-03-09T09:20:00.000Z	drobole	adventure__	 might have to change "nvidia" if you dont have that driver loaded. (lsmod | grep nvidia)
2011-03-09T09:21:00.000Z	adventure__	drobole	by golly, it worked!
2011-03-09T09:22:00.000Z	drobole	adventure__	 awsome
2011-03-09T09:22:00.000Z	drobole	adventure__	unix is your friend :D
2011-03-09T09:23:00.000Z	adventure__	drobole	thanks for your help, bud
