2012-11-29T07:48:00.000Z	B0101		Hi, whenever I try to download something from the ubuntu software center or update my system, it reports that it failed to download packages and asks me to check my connection. how can I fix that?
2012-11-29T07:49:00.000Z	almoxarife	B0101	how are you connected
2012-11-29T07:49:00.000Z	B0101	almoxarife	I am connected by a wireless access point, leading to the modem
2012-11-29T07:53:00.000Z	almoxarife	B0101	if you are having connection issues then you should see it with other apps, like the browser, do you have problems with the browser?
2012-11-29T07:53:00.000Z	B0101	almoxarife	Nope, the browser works as per normal
2012-11-29T07:54:00.000Z	almoxarife	B0101	where are you downloading updates from, the mirror you chose is?
2012-11-29T07:56:00.000Z	B0101	almoxarife	my computer uses: sg.archive.ubuntu.com
2012-11-29T07:57:00.000Z	almoxarife	B0101	choose a more common mirror, try us.archive.......... , as a test, if it works then dont use 'sg'
2012-11-29T08:00:00.000Z	B0101	almoxarife	Nope, the browser works as per normal
2012-11-29T08:00:00.000Z	almoxarife	B0101	browser?
2012-11-29T08:01:00.000Z	B0101	almoxarife	If you mean my browser, it is Mozilla Firefox
2012-11-29T08:03:00.000Z	almoxarife	B0101	no, i mean that browser is not the issue i was talking about last, the install/update mirror is related to your issue, 'cant download updates'
2012-11-29T08:06:00.000Z	B0101	almoxarife	sorry about that, but I don't get what you mean by your last message, could your re-write it?
2012-11-29T08:08:00.000Z	almoxarife	B0101	no, i mean that browser is not the issue i was talking about last, the install/update mirror is related to your issue, 'cant download updates' , change the mirror to 'us.archive....' then try to update
2012-11-29T08:16:00.000Z	B0101	almoxarife	Nope, it does not work, even when I change it to us.archive.ubuntu.com
2012-11-29T08:18:00.000Z	almoxarife	B0101	open a terminal, run this, 'sudo apt-get install pastebinit'
2012-11-29T08:19:00.000Z	almoxarife	B0101	then run in terminal, 'sudo apt-get update | pastebinit' , share the link
2012-11-29T08:22:00.000Z	B0101	almoxarife	The install completed successfully
2012-11-29T08:24:00.000Z	B0101	almoxarife	The link: http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ quantal/main pastebinit all 1.3-2ubuntu3
