2006-10-29T12:55:00.000Z	KenThomson	gogeta	You PMed me to say that Linux 6.10 supports 3d desktop out of the box, but i need to install nvidia drivers for it ( i have nvidia fx 5200 - 128MB - Graphics Card), But you aslo said that Ubuntu installs nvidia drivers by default.
2006-10-29T12:56:00.000Z	KenThomson	gogeta	So do i have 3d Desktop out of the box, or do i need to get some EXTRA drivers for 3D? Where do i get the 3D drivers from?
2006-10-29T13:02:00.000Z	KenThomson	gogeta	So i go to Nvidia's website, download the "offical drivers", install them somehow ( i dont know how i am going to manage all this on Linux), and than i shall have 3d desktop, right?
2006-10-29T13:06:00.000Z	KenThomson	gogeta	You were talking about a guide or 3-commands, i could appreciate if you could outline them or link to the guide for me. This is in reference to using 3d official nivida drivers for my fx 5200 graphics card
2006-10-29T13:48:00.000Z	KenThomson	gogeta	i am ready to take risk? But where do i go to do a netboot? What are all the pre-requisites? Some sites?
