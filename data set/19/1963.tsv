2010-08-16T00:21:00.000Z	HoopyFrood		I installed Lucid and Grub to an external hard drive, but whenever I boot to the hard drive, the grub rescue screen appears. I have tried installing grub onto the drive from ubuntu, another copy of which I have on my internal drive, and manually replacing the grub folder as root, both without success
2010-08-16T00:21:00.000Z	ikonia	HoopyFrood	what rescue screen
2010-08-16T00:22:00.000Z	ikonia	HoopyFrood	exactly what do you get on screen
2010-08-16T00:22:00.000Z	HoopyFrood	ikonia	instead of the bootloader, it says GRUB rescue >
2010-08-16T00:23:00.000Z	ikonia	HoopyFrood	ok, so your grub is looking at the wrong partitions for it's menu info
2010-08-16T00:23:00.000Z	HoopyFrood	ikonia	why, though?
2010-08-16T00:23:00.000Z	ikonia	HoopyFrood	probably becuase you're using a USB drive and it didn't work out the install info properly
2010-08-16T00:24:00.000Z	HoopyFrood	ikonia	I reinsatlled it via the terminal on ubuntu on my internal drive
2010-08-16T00:24:00.000Z	HoopyFrood	ikonia	it being grub
2010-08-16T00:24:00.000Z	ikonia	HoopyFrood	then you've installed it to look at the wrong places
2010-08-16T00:25:00.000Z	HoopyFrood	ikonia	so the automatic installation went wrong... :( I can maually edit grub.cfg, then, I guess
2010-08-16T00:25:00.000Z	ikonia	HoopyFrood	that won't do anything
2010-08-16T00:25:00.000Z	HoopyFrood	ikonia	so how should I reconfigure it?
2010-08-16T00:26:00.000Z	HoopyFrood	ikonia	already checked that link
2010-08-16T00:26:00.000Z	ikonia	HoopyFrood	ok, so then you understand how to point grub at the right parrtitions
2010-08-16T00:27:00.000Z	HoopyFrood	ikonia	right, and it hasnt worked
2010-08-16T00:27:00.000Z	ikonia	HoopyFrood	then you've not configured it right, or the ubuntu partition is corrupt/damaged
2010-08-16T00:27:00.000Z	HoopyFrood	ikonia	damn... well, I'll give it another shot
2010-08-16T00:28:00.000Z	HoopyFrood	ikonia	before i reinstall
