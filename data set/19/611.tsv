2011-11-29T00:59:00.000Z	elb0w		So i just installed ubuntu on one of our servers and all I have are random specs of colors
2011-11-29T00:59:00.000Z	elb0w		when it boots
2011-11-29T00:59:00.000Z	elb0w		any idea?
2011-11-29T01:00:00.000Z	hasufell	elb0w	does not happen with the livecd i guess?
2011-11-29T01:00:00.000Z	elb0w	hasufell	installed it straight
2011-11-29T01:00:00.000Z	elb0w		didnt go to live cd
2011-11-29T01:01:00.000Z	hasufell	elb0w	try livecd...
2011-11-29T01:01:00.000Z	elb0w	hasufell	why
2011-11-29T01:01:00.000Z	elb0w		it has nvidia cards in it
2011-11-29T01:01:00.000Z	hasufell	elb0w	if its not even working there, then its about the installation/setup itself
2011-11-29T01:01:00.000Z	hasufell		of ubuntu i mean
2011-11-29T01:02:00.000Z	elb0w		grub works
2011-11-29T01:02:00.000Z	hasufell	elb0w	try with knoppix as well. if it does not work in knoppix, it wont work anywhere
2011-11-29T01:02:00.000Z	elb0w		ive used this cd on 5 other machines
2011-11-29T01:02:00.000Z	elb0w		no issue
2011-11-29T01:02:00.000Z	elb0w		knoppix?
2011-11-29T01:02:00.000Z	hasufell	elb0w	thats a rescue livecd it has the best hardware detection i know of
2011-11-29T01:03:00.000Z	hasufell	elb0w	if knoppix does not work properly for you its definitley a hardware issue...
2011-11-29T01:07:00.000Z	elb0w	hasufell	nomodeset worked fine
