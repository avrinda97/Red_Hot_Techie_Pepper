2009-02-05T08:59:00.000Z	mib		i wanted to trasnfer some of the 68GB of unallocated to my sda4. But there seems no easy way out
2009-02-05T09:00:00.000Z	mib		because the current sda4 space is limited which is 20GB and only left few GB..i plan to find ways to absorb some unalocated space to there
2009-02-05T09:00:00.000Z	mib		any thing i could do currently to do that
2009-02-05T09:01:00.000Z	mib		storage
2009-02-05T09:01:00.000Z	mib		my main current space is 20GB (sda4) which contain the bin...etc..
2009-02-05T09:02:00.000Z	mib		ah?
2009-02-05T09:02:00.000Z	mib		moutn which dirve? the unaalocated space?
2009-02-05T09:02:00.000Z	mib		mount as a new drive arghh2d2?
2009-02-05T09:03:00.000Z	mib		means i will have 20GB as one drive (sda4) and another 68GB as another drive
2009-02-05T09:03:00.000Z	mib		is that formatting them using gparted?
2009-02-05T09:04:00.000Z	arghh2d2	mib	adding it to fstab is easy
2009-02-05T08:56:00.000Z	arghh2d2	mib	cfdisk works
2009-02-05T08:59:00.000Z	arghh2d2	mib	, you cant send partition space to anothe drive
2009-02-05T09:01:00.000Z	arghh2d2	mib	what do you need the new space for? system files or storage?
2009-02-05T09:02:00.000Z	arghh2d2	mib	yeah
2009-02-05T09:03:00.000Z	arghh2d2	mib	well format it first if you havent already
2009-02-05T09:04:00.000Z	arghh2d2	mib	yeah, gparted
2009-02-05T09:05:00.000Z	arghh2d2	mib	yes
2009-02-05T09:06:00.000Z	arghh2d2	mib	thats what i dont understand...you CANNOT put free space from one drive to another drive, it's not a virtual filesystem
