2007-08-01T14:37:00.000Z	CheeseGarener		Quick question, I rescanned my hard drive for errors
2007-08-01T14:37:00.000Z	CheeseGarener		and I used gparted to partition it, and it "seems" to partition it into some unallocated  space, but it says there were some "errors" when it did the partiton
2007-08-01T14:39:00.000Z	CheeseGarener		Do I have to make a new "primary" partition for ubuntu?
2007-08-01T14:40:00.000Z	CheeseGarener		when I install it?  Or will it boot from an extended?
2007-08-01T14:40:00.000Z	Enselic	CheeseGarener	nope, it can e a logical partion as well
2007-08-01T14:41:00.000Z	Enselic	CheeseGarener	how does your current partiion table and OS installations look like?
2007-08-01T14:42:00.000Z	Enselic	CheeseGarener	prefer logical
2007-08-01T14:42:00.000Z	Enselic	CheeseGarener	it does not have any performance impact
2007-08-01T14:42:00.000Z	Enselic	CheeseGarener	iirc logical ones are easier to resize
2007-08-01T14:43:00.000Z	Enselic	CheeseGarener	yes, you will want a swap partition
2007-08-01T14:43:00.000Z	Enselic	CheeseGarener	yes
2007-08-01T14:44:00.000Z	Enselic	CheeseGarener	2 gig: logical partition: swap    18 gig: logical: ext3     mount as root (/)
2007-08-01T14:44:00.000Z	Enselic	CheeseGarener	beginning
2007-08-01T14:44:00.000Z	Enselic	CheeseGarener	but again, it does not matter much for performance
2007-08-01T14:45:00.000Z	Enselic	CheeseGarener	not necessary
2007-08-01T14:46:00.000Z	Enselic	CheeseGarener	for a single laptop install, it is not necessary to boether with a separate /home
2007-08-01T14:47:00.000Z	Enselic	CheeseGarener	if you were building a network with hunders of computers, you would want to plan /home
2007-08-01T14:52:00.000Z	Enselic	CheeseGarener	the installer allows you to specify where to mount what partitions
2007-08-01T14:52:00.000Z	Enselic	CheeseGarener	if not, you can easily fix that afterwards by editing /etc/fstab
