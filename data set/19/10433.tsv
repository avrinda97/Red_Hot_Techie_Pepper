2006-08-10T06:54:00.000Z	demente		Hi
2006-08-10T06:55:00.000Z	demente		I'm having some trouble.
2006-08-10T06:55:00.000Z	demente		I just added a new account, and I wish to switch to it.
2006-08-10T06:56:00.000Z	demente		However, although it is added to sudoers and all apppropriate groups, I have _no_ sound
2006-08-10T06:56:00.000Z	demente		Other than system beep, I can't play music.
2006-08-10T06:58:00.000Z	demente		Actually, how can I change my username in ubuntu?
2006-08-10T06:58:00.000Z	demente		I wish to change what I login as, etc
2006-08-10T07:00:00.000Z	demente		Hello? Anyone?
2006-08-10T07:00:00.000Z	demente		I wish to change my username...
2006-08-10T07:01:00.000Z	jrib	demente	are you in the audio group?
2006-08-10T07:03:00.000Z	demente	jrib	yes
2006-08-10T07:03:00.000Z	jrib	demente	'man usermod' to see how to change your username, you should update the user's home directory as well
2006-08-10T07:03:00.000Z	jrib	demente	are you still having audio problems?
2006-08-10T07:03:00.000Z	demente		yeah
2006-08-10T07:03:00.000Z	jrib	demente	it works with your other user though?

2006-08-10T07:04:00.000Z	demente	jrib	yes
2006-08-10T07:05:00.000Z	jrib	demente	have you logged out and logged back in after adding the user to the 'audio' group?
2006-08-10T07:06:00.000Z	demente	jrib	yeah, but I'll do so again.
