2006-04-08T13:03:00.000Z	walden	cpt_foo	what are you using to partition? during the install process, it asks you to create partition from either free space, or by deleting a previous partition
2006-04-08T13:03:00.000Z	cpt_foo	walden	i mean from within my ubuntu install
2006-04-08T13:04:00.000Z	walden	cpt_foo	do you already have free space?
2006-04-08T13:04:00.000Z	cpt_foo	walden	yes
2006-04-08T13:04:00.000Z	walden	cpt_foo	the free space is not in your current linux disk/install is it?
2006-04-08T13:05:00.000Z	cpt_foo	walden	i think it is
2006-04-08T13:05:00.000Z	walden	cpt_foo	use fdisk to create it. or you can use gnu parted to create the partition
2006-04-08T13:05:00.000Z	walden	cpt_foo	if it is in your current used partition, then i would suggest you partition while re-installing. but you might want a second opinion
2006-04-08T13:06:00.000Z	cpt_foo	walden	how much space does my / need to be so that i can give the rest to my home
2006-04-08T13:06:00.000Z	cpt_foo	walden	I want to just make it from my / partition
2006-04-08T13:06:00.000Z	walden	cpt_foo	how much total space do you have for linux?
2006-04-08T13:07:00.000Z	cpt_foo	walden	a whole 70+gig hd
2006-04-08T13:07:00.000Z	walden	cpt_foo	wow.
2006-04-08T13:08:00.000Z	walden	cpt_foo	i have a 12G space.. 1G swap, 5 GB /home, and the rest to /
2006-04-08T13:08:00.000Z	cpt_foo	walden	hmm so what would I put in term to make /home like 20gb?
2006-04-08T13:17:00.000Z	walden	cpt_foo	use gnu parted. or gparted.
2006-04-08T13:17:00.000Z	cpt_foo	walden	I am but it wont let me
