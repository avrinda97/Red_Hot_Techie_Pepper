2005-07-04T10:34:00.000Z	Quest-Master		Ack!
2005-07-04T10:35:00.000Z	Razor-X	Quest-Master	SYN? ;)
2005-07-14T07:22:00.000Z	Razor-X	Quest-Master	OMG OMG i'm too cheap to buy stuff!!11!! ;)
2005-07-14T07:27:00.000Z	Razor-X	Quest-Master	not at all
2005-07-14T07:27:00.000Z	Razor-X	Quest-Master	you must be smoking something real foreign, numerous test results agree, Opera is second-least among full-featured Linux browsers, preceded only by Konquerer on a KDE box
2005-07-14T07:28:00.000Z	Quest-Master	Razor-X	link me to these recent test results then?
2005-07-14T07:28:00.000Z	Quest-Master	Razor-X	There are fixes for slow rendering with a few quick changes of the options.
2005-07-14T07:29:00.000Z	Razor-X	Quest-Master	some people also would like to pay for a Lambourghini than get a fre car from '78
2005-07-14T07:30:00.000Z	Quest-Master	Razor-X	sorry, but you're comparing apples and oranges now. That argument about cars is void. ;)
2005-07-14T07:30:00.000Z	Razor-X	Quest-Master	doubt it ;)
2005-07-14T07:31:00.000Z	Razor-X	Quest-Master	did I say that?
2005-07-14T07:31:00.000Z	Quest-Master	Razor-X	You sure did imply it. Want me to copy and paste the line where you did?
2005-07-14T07:31:00.000Z	Razor-X	Quest-Master	yes please, go ahead
2005-07-14T07:32:00.000Z	Razor-X	Quest-Master	my ";)" is the equivalent of the :) smilie
2005-07-14T07:32:00.000Z	Quest-Master	Razor-X	Should've used the :) smiley then I suppose to avoid disambiguation, right? :)
2005-07-14T07:34:00.000Z	Razor-X	Quest-Master	I don't follow the OSS Flag like a blind idiot
2005-07-14T07:35:00.000Z	Quest-Master	Razor-X	Neither do I. I use Photoshop all the time because it was designed from a designer's perspective and Gimp not.
2005-07-14T07:35:00.000Z	Razor-X	Quest-Master	good then
2005-07-14T07:36:00.000Z	Quest-Master	Razor-X	Except, I'm simply trying to point out that Firefox isn't as terrible as you make it out to be. :) Don't want to lynch you or anything, we're buds! Everyone is in #ubuntu besides people like vgui..
