2009-04-07T07:57:00.000Z	jrib	tgr_	you are missing a field
2009-04-07T07:59:00.000Z	jrib	tgr_	musikgoat|main: erm, never mind.  My eyes are tired...
2009-04-07T08:04:00.000Z	jrib	tgr_	you realize that if you set a label for your drive, it will get mounted to /media/LABEL automatically?
2009-04-07T08:05:00.000Z	jrib	tgr_	hmm?  I didn't say anything about a problem :/
2009-04-07T08:05:00.000Z	jrib	tgr_	there's no problem that I see...
2009-04-07T08:06:00.000Z	jrib	tgr_	your choice
2009-04-07T08:09:00.000Z	jrib	tgr_	you shouldn't unplug it without mounting
2009-04-07T08:10:00.000Z	jrib	tgr_	possibly
