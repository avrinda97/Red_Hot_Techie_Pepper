2008-06-19T17:58:00.000Z	carlisle		no
2008-06-19T17:59:00.000Z	carlisle		I tried yahoo games and it brings up an error page with links for java downloads
2008-06-19T17:59:00.000Z	carlisle		and right now I am hanging on housecall.antivirus.com
2008-06-19T17:59:00.000Z	soundray	carlisle	what kind of system do you have? 32 or 64bit?
2008-06-19T18:01:00.000Z	soundray	carlisle	seems so. Have a look at http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=1174435
2008-06-19T18:44:00.000Z	soundray	carlisle	remind me
2008-06-19T18:45:00.000Z	soundray	carlisle	did you read the section specific to your release?
2008-06-19T18:45:00.000Z	soundray	carlisle	*ubuntu release
2008-06-19T18:46:00.000Z	soundray	carlisle	are you running firefox32 now?
2008-06-19T18:46:00.000Z	soundray	carlisle	and is a java plugin listed when you enter about:plugins as the URL?
2008-06-19T18:47:00.000Z	soundray	carlisle	then you need to remove all except the one you want to use
2008-06-19T18:48:00.000Z	soundray	carlisle	oh, you've got libgcjplugin, correct?
2008-06-19T18:48:00.000Z	soundray	carlisle	no pasting!
2008-06-19T18:49:00.000Z	soundray	carlisle	use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste the page contents
2008-06-19T18:49:00.000Z	soundray	carlisle	okay
2008-06-19T18:49:00.000Z	soundray	carlisle	in a terminal, run 'sudo update-alternatives --config java' and tell me which one is configured (marked with a *)
2008-06-19T18:51:00.000Z	soundray	carlisle	change it so the icedtea jre is active
2008-06-19T18:52:00.000Z	soundray	carlisle	yes, try. The important thing is that the configured jre and your firefox plugin correspond.
