2011-11-26T04:58:00.000Z	zykotick9	genii-around	(sasori) i believe your initial command is correct (i'd personally have given "usermod -aG ..." but i'm sure your way should work too.  sasori is your username sasori?
2011-11-26T04:58:00.000Z	genii-around	zykotick9	Yeah I always mess up which comes first in that command for some reason
2011-11-26T04:59:00.000Z	genii-around	zykotick9	No, the recovery boot puts you at #
2011-11-26T05:04:00.000Z	zykotick9	genii-around	sorry wasn't thinking about the right thing.  see above ;)
2012-03-04T02:33:00.000Z	zykotick9	genii-around	i'd personally consider anything under /usr to be system sacred territory (but perhaps that's to conservative)
2012-06-09T01:47:00.000Z	zykotick9	genii-around	if you're ever looking for a terminal-based torrent client - rtorrent is excellent
2012-06-27T18:50:00.000Z	zykotick9	genii-around	key word being "Almost" ;)
2012-06-27T18:50:00.000Z	genii-around	zykotick9	Heh, yes
2012-07-03T23:01:00.000Z	zykotick9	genii-around	where you really wondering about DMs?  DE and WM are typically alternatives to one another (though DEs use some sort of WM - but not one that's typically installed by itself)
2012-07-03T23:06:00.000Z	genii-around	zykotick9	Yes, like xdm,gdm, etc.
2012-07-03T23:07:00.000Z	zykotick9	genii-around	i use slim as a dm on my desktop, my netbook doesn't have one
2012-07-03T23:09:00.000Z	genii-around	zykotick9	I was more wondering something like... if you installed manually lightdm for instance as tiger did but have no desktop environment... does it pull one in as a dependency or just maybe dump you into something like twm
2012-07-03T23:09:00.000Z	zykotick9	genii-around	a de/wm shouldn't be a dependency (it might be) - but it's kinda useless to have a DM if you have no environments?!?
2012-07-03T23:10:00.000Z	genii-around	zykotick9	Yes, exactly
2012-07-05T22:29:00.000Z	zykotick9	genii-around	dm != wm
2012-07-05T22:30:00.000Z	genii-around	zykotick9	Yes, I re-read and realized that after I already posted
2012-07-11T21:33:00.000Z	genii-around	zykotick9	Maybe should have used !sudo instead ;)
2012-09-24T22:23:00.000Z	zykotick9	genii-around	!dontzap seems to have been removed both factoid and wiki page
2012-09-24T22:23:00.000Z	genii-around	zykotick9	Hm.
