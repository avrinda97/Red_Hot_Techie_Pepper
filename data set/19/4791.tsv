2008-11-04T04:15:00.000Z	robacarp		How do I permanantly change a device directory permissions?  My sound doesn't work until I chmod 666 /dev/dsp after boot
2008-11-04T04:16:00.000Z	psusi	robacarp	you need to put yourself in the dsp group to access the sound device
2008-11-04T04:17:00.000Z	robacarp	psusi	do all users need to be in that group?
2008-11-04T04:17:00.000Z	psusi	robacarp	only the ones you want to be able to play sound
2008-11-04T04:18:00.000Z	robacarp	psusi	...why is this not done by default?
2008-11-04T04:18:00.000Z	psusi	robacarp	err, it might not be dsp actually... it's whatever group owns /dev/dsp by default
2008-11-04T04:18:00.000Z	psusi	robacarp	I think it is when you make the user with the gui
2008-11-04T04:19:00.000Z	robacarp	psusi	my system says audio
2008-11-04T04:19:00.000Z	psusi	robacarp	that's the one
2008-11-04T04:20:00.000Z	robacarp	psusi	I assume that I'll then not have to reset the permissions on the dsp device at restart?
2008-11-04T04:21:00.000Z	psusi	robacarp	yes... by default it is configured for members of the sound group to have access
2008-11-04T04:21:00.000Z	robacarp	psusi	okay.  thanks for the info, Im working on setting that now
2008-11-04T04:22:00.000Z	psusi	robacarp	I got burned by that one myself once because I had to bootstrap my system by hand and created my user from the command line which didn't put him in the sound group
2008-11-04T04:23:00.000Z	robacarp	psusi	yea, this is on a server, so there is no gui at all, and the main user was deleted when samba was installed ;-)
2008-11-04T04:26:00.000Z	robacarp	psusi	any idea what the default permissions are on that directory?
2008-11-04T04:26:00.000Z	robacarp	psusi	660?
2008-11-04T04:27:00.000Z	psusi	robacarp	it isn't a directory, it's a devnode.... yea... probably 660... just reboot and see ;)
2008-11-04T04:28:00.000Z	robacarp	psusi	thanks again.
2008-11-04T04:36:00.000Z	robacarp	psusi	that didn't seem to work. I added myself to the audio group and still can't play anything except as sudo
