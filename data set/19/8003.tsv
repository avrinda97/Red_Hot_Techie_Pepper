2007-06-08T10:01:00.000Z	v3n0m`		hi i neeed help with this issue http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/24364/
2007-06-08T10:02:00.000Z	gravemind	v3n0m`	you need to chown your stuff
2007-06-08T10:03:00.000Z	gravemind	v3n0m`	try this http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=2308651
2007-06-08T10:31:00.000Z	v3n0m`	gravemind	I'm looking into your link, thx
2007-06-08T10:32:00.000Z	gravemind	v3n0m`	cool. I hope it works
2007-06-08T10:44:00.000Z	v3n0m`	gravemind	I removed my .dmrc, .Xauthority, .ICEauthority directories so I can't chmod these directories
2007-06-08T10:52:00.000Z	gravemind	v3n0m`	...why did you remove that stuff? Anyway, how's it going?
2007-06-08T11:06:00.000Z	v3n0m`	gravemind	I was told to by other helpers (I assumed these directories would be regenerated with the correct permissions automatically)
2007-06-08T11:06:00.000Z	v3n0m`	gravemind	It is not going well, I'm forced to use windows
2007-06-08T11:09:00.000Z	gravemind	v3n0m`	backup your data (if you have any) and reinstall ubuntu if you can't find a better solution.
2007-06-08T11:16:00.000Z	v3n0m`	gravemind	I
2007-06-08T11:16:00.000Z	v3n0m`	gravemind	am aware of that option, but I've a feeling it's a very simple problem, given what I've heard from others..
2007-06-08T11:17:00.000Z	gravemind	v3n0m`	have you tried just recreating those folders and files (and just leaving them empty?)
2007-06-08T11:27:00.000Z	v3n0m`	gravemind	will do =)
2007-06-08T11:27:00.000Z	gravemind	v3n0m`	it might not work, but it's worth a try
2007-06-08T11:28:00.000Z	gravemind	v3n0m`	it might also be easy just to make another user and delete the old broken one
2007-06-08T11:29:00.000Z	v3n0m`	gravemind	rgr
2007-06-08T11:30:00.000Z	gravemind	v3n0m`	?
2007-06-08T13:53:00.000Z	v3n0m`	gravemind	u around?
