2009-10-16T20:37:00.000Z	docmax		windows displays a specific answer
2009-10-16T20:37:00.000Z	IdleOne	docmax	without knowing make and model of the printer, is like me asking you why my car won't start. There is a thousand reasons....
2009-10-16T20:38:00.000Z	IdleOne	docmax	llutz was a little harsh but he was correct in suggesting you look at the manual for the printer
2009-10-16T20:38:00.000Z	docmax	IdleOne	the windows driver tell me: wrong paper format f.e.
2009-10-16T20:38:00.000Z	IdleOne	docmax	then that is probably the issue.
2009-10-16T21:29:00.000Z	IdleOne	docmax	it is not Linux fault if driver support for your printer is "choppy" complain to the manufacturer and ask them to put out some linux drivers for the product
2009-10-18T20:35:00.000Z	IdleOne	docmax	sudo apt-get -f install
2009-10-18T20:36:00.000Z	docmax	IdleOne	still error with subprocess
2009-10-18T20:36:00.000Z	IdleOne	docmax	remove samba and reinstall it
2009-10-18T20:37:00.000Z	docmax	IdleOne	cant remove or install it
2009-10-18T20:37:00.000Z	IdleOne	docmax	paste the error to paste.ubuntu.com please, maybe we can figure this out
2009-10-18T20:38:00.000Z	docmax	IdleOne	problem is its german
2009-10-18T20:38:00.000Z	IdleOne	docmax	that will be a problem
2009-10-18T20:42:00.000Z	docmax	IdleOne	did u get the link?
2009-10-18T20:43:00.000Z	IdleOne	docmax	sudo apt-get --reinstall samba
2009-10-18T20:43:00.000Z	IdleOne	docmax	see if that helps
2009-10-27T21:02:00.000Z	IdleOne	docmax	search in Synaptic package Manager.
