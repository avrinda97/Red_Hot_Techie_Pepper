2008-11-19T22:38:00.000Z	Joker_-_	sipior	I'm nice. Almost no priority at all
2009-03-03T21:13:00.000Z	Joker_-_	sipior	humk, and what is?
2009-03-03T21:13:00.000Z	sipior	Joker_-_	bogomips is not an especially reliable indicator of performance :-)
2009-03-03T21:13:00.000Z	sipior	Joker_-_	that's a complicated question, which depends upon what you want to do with your machine.
2009-03-03T21:16:00.000Z	Joker_-_	sipior	I'm swapping 3 machines for different reasons. I have a media center that is way too weak, my desktop is way too powerfull for what I do but the media center is still too weak for using as a desktop so Imma swap it with my NAS server. all in all, nas will become my desktop, media center will become NAS and my desktop will become the mediacenter.
2009-03-03T21:18:00.000Z	Joker_-_	sipior	My choice of swapping boxes is based on "troughput" of the machines. I was testing some other of my servers and figured that the AMD Athlon XP 2600+ was weaker than a P4 1.8, so I was wondering why. I know it's clocked slower but it's supposed to be the equivalent of a 2600mhz from INTEL since it does more operations per cycles.
2009-03-03T21:19:00.000Z	Joker_-_	sipior	so, got enough tinformations to understand what I wanna do with the boxes?
2009-03-03T21:20:00.000Z	Joker_-_	sipior	the lamp server will get 512mb, so will the nas, my desktop will have 1gb and the media center will get my actual desktop, a quadcore with 4gb
2009-03-03T21:22:00.000Z	sipior	Joker_-_	apologies, i was away.
2009-03-03T21:25:00.000Z	Joker_-_	sipior	lol, no problems
2009-03-03T21:26:00.000Z	Joker_-_	sipior	read back or not, msg me if you have any clue, I'll go to #hardware as suggested by hwilde
2009-03-03T21:26:00.000Z	sipior	Joker_-_	try not to focus too much on processor speed. depending on what you want a machine to do, hard disk speed, memory and cache availability can be far more important. you'll get better advise in #hardware, i suspect :-)
2009-03-03T21:27:00.000Z	Joker_-_	sipior	yeah but in this case thats ram & cpu I need / miss...
2009-03-03T21:27:00.000Z	Joker_-_	sipior	all the hard drives are the same, or almost.
2009-03-03T21:27:00.000Z	Joker_-_	sipior	everything is "hosted" on the nas
2009-03-03T21:28:00.000Z	Joker_-_	sipior	and the nas has an external drive bay (sata)
