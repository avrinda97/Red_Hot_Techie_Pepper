2011-03-29T17:07:00.000Z	ohsix	nick_name	haha someone tricked you, ctrl+s is scroll lock, "unfreeze" it with ctrl+q
2011-03-29T17:07:00.000Z	nick_name	ohsix	thanks for the info
2011-03-29T17:08:00.000Z	ohsix	nick_name	you might have missed someone mention ^Q shortly thereafter
2011-03-29T17:31:00.000Z	ohsix	nick_name	you do it with passwd like anything else, but you really should use sudo, if you want a root shell use sudo -s
2011-03-29T17:31:00.000Z	nick_name	ohsix	why live cd can access as root without prompting for password?
2011-03-29T17:32:00.000Z	ohsix	nick_name	because that's useful, also; the "ubuntu" account has no password, thus it doesn't ask you for "ubuntu"-s password to change to root
2011-03-29T17:32:00.000Z	ohsix	nick_name	if you set a passwd for the "ubuntu" account it'll ask for it when you use sudo
2011-03-29T17:33:00.000Z	nick_name	ohsix	so livecd root uses ubuntu account and i just need to  set password for it?
2011-03-29T17:33:00.000Z	ohsix	nick_name	yes
2011-03-29T17:35:00.000Z	nick_name	ohsix	it shows ubuntu user does not exist
2011-03-29T17:35:00.000Z	nick_name	ohsix	im using ubuntu server btw
2011-03-29T17:35:00.000Z	ohsix	nick_name	then that's not a livecd bro
2011-03-29T17:36:00.000Z	nick_name	ohsix	anyone with access to livecd can    change my system as root?
2011-03-29T17:36:00.000Z	ohsix	nick_name	anyone with physical access to your computer can do anything, far worse things than changing a password
2011-03-29T17:44:00.000Z	ohsix	nick_name	links is great
