2005-09-17T05:22:00.000Z	DVSoftware		its easier than ubuntu
2005-09-17T05:22:00.000Z	DVSoftware		it has shitload of config dialogs
2005-09-17T05:24:00.000Z	DVSoftware		i'll follow linuxfromscratch guide
2005-09-17T05:24:00.000Z	DVSoftware		:D
2005-09-17T05:25:00.000Z	DVSoftware		and i was too bored to continue
2005-09-17T05:26:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	DVSoftware	no, not really
2005-09-17T05:26:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	DVSoftware	it would have been the same speed
2005-09-17T05:26:00.000Z	DVSoftware	HrdwrBoB	like what?
2005-09-17T05:26:00.000Z	DVSoftware		like gentoo?
2005-09-17T05:27:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB		compiling your own software doesn't gain you speed
2005-09-17T05:27:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB		it wastes your time
2005-09-17T05:27:00.000Z	DVSoftware	HrdwrBoB	wrong
2005-09-17T05:28:00.000Z	DVSoftware	HrdwrBoB	you compile it for your own cpu
2005-09-17T05:28:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	DVSoftware	I know EXACTLY how it works.
2005-09-17T05:28:00.000Z	DVSoftware	HrdwrBoB	optimization flags?
2005-09-17T05:28:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	DVSoftware	you're lucky to get 5%
2005-09-17T05:28:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB		at best
2005-09-17T05:29:00.000Z	DVSoftware	HrdwrBoB	and if you compile entire system with that?
2005-09-17T05:29:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	DVSoftware	then you've wasted literally days
