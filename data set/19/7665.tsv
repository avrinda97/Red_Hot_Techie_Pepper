2007-07-16T12:28:00.000Z	Nubbie	Vsop_Vsop	what graphics card do you have?
2007-07-16T12:29:00.000Z	Nubbie	Vsop_Vsop	first off, type sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg

2007-07-16T12:30:00.000Z	Nubbie	Vsop_Vsop	and select the "ati" driver. the rest you should leave default, until you get to the resolutions. choose your monitor's native resolution, nothing higher.
2007-07-16T12:31:00.000Z	Nubbie	Vsop_Vsop	and now your x isn't working.
2007-07-16T12:31:00.000Z	Nubbie	Vsop_Vsop	ctrl alt F6, log in, sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg.
2007-07-16T12:34:00.000Z	Nubbie	Vsop_Vsop	ati driver should work for you.
2007-07-16T12:35:00.000Z	Nubbie	Vsop_Vsop	it should be there for sure.
2007-07-16T12:36:00.000Z	Nubbie	Vsop_Vsop	use vesa then.
2007-07-16T12:38:00.000Z	Nubbie	Vsop_Vsop	all default answers until you get to resolutions
2007-07-16T13:12:00.000Z	Nubbie	Vsop_Vsop	did you try to sleep/suspend your computer?
