2012-06-25T21:05:00.000Z	drag0nius		how could i limit bandwidth usage of server?
2012-06-25T21:05:00.000Z	drag0nius		sth like netlimiter
2012-06-25T21:06:00.000Z	kyle__	drag0nius	I _think_ you can limmit it someways using iptables, but IIRC non trivial.  It's easy to do with a proxy like squid however.
2012-06-26T22:23:00.000Z	kyle__	drag0nius	What "server" are you thinking of?
2012-06-26T22:24:00.000Z	kyle__	drag0nius	If say, you've got it on a mac and are sharing it, then it should use the mac's driver (cups client passes to cups server passes to OSX driver).  If it's a windows share, not so  much.
2012-06-26T22:24:00.000Z	kyle__	drag0nius	Sure, if the server is using the real driver, the client can just use it as generic or anything really.  Cups passes it along.
2012-06-26T22:24:00.000Z	kyle__	drag0nius	Very much so.
2012-06-26T22:25:00.000Z	kyle__	drag0nius	But nicely, if you tell windows to connect to an IPP printer that's on CUPS, and that it's a generic windows color imagesetter, it will push postscript at CUPS, and cups will use it's native driver.
2012-06-26T22:26:00.000Z	kyle__	drag0nius	I think you need help from #cups then.
2012-06-26T22:27:00.000Z	kyle__	drag0nius	If it's a windows client, why not try it as an IPP printer first?
2012-06-26T22:28:00.000Z	kyle__	drag0nius	The only downside in windows is the ugly printer-name it makes.
2012-06-26T22:28:00.000Z	kyle__	drag0nius	And of course if you do IPP first, and it works, then you' know the bulk of the chain is fine, and the smb thing is yoru only problem.
2012-06-26T22:29:00.000Z	kyle__	drag0nius	You add a printer and give it a host of http://<ip of your server>:631/<printername>, then choose generic drivers, generic windows color imagesetter.
2012-06-26T22:29:00.000Z	kyle__	drag0nius	Or if you want you can choose the apple drivers, and one of their color PS printers.  That works too.
2012-06-26T22:36:00.000Z	kyle__	drag0nius	If I recall, on ubuntu you need to login as a user who is in the lpadmin group.
2012-06-26T22:39:00.000Z	kyle__	drag0nius	Maybe it's printers.  It's been awhile....
2012-06-26T22:39:00.000Z	kyle__	drag0nius	Choose a generic one.
2012-06-26T22:39:00.000Z	kyle__	drag0nius	THen CUPS will do it's magic (assuming it's setup right in ubuntu)(
2012-06-26T22:39:00.000Z	kyle__	drag0nius	Yup, that will spit out generic color postscript.
