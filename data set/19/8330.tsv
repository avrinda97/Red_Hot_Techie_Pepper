2007-04-11T09:41:00.000Z	mbt	Cacti1	are you looking to add something to it?
2007-04-11T09:42:00.000Z	Cacti1	mbt	actually remove something from it.

2007-04-11T09:43:00.000Z	Cacti1	mbt	I have to instances of the same program available for choosing and I would like to remove one.
2007-04-11T09:44:00.000Z	Cacti1		It's a video player...
2007-04-11T09:44:00.000Z	Cacti1		xine
2007-04-11T09:45:00.000Z	mbt	Cacti1	Hrm.  I am not sure... I don't see anything in gconf or in the .gnome2 directory that shows what the context menu options are for things like that.
2007-04-11T09:45:00.000Z	Cacti1	mbt	yeah... I looked in the .gnome2 directory and never seen anything either...
2007-04-11T09:47:00.000Z	Cacti1		and in the nautilus-scripts directory
2007-04-11T09:48:00.000Z	mbt	Cacti1	Nautilus-scripts is for the scripted actions that you can add into Nautilus, so that's something different.
