2009-09-10T03:01:00.000Z	Casandrax	Waseem	modem port/remote dialup ?
2009-09-10T03:02:00.000Z	Waseem	Casandrax	not sure what your asking, but I use wifi to connect to the internet with the laptop.
2009-09-10T03:02:00.000Z	Casandrax	Waseem	Then its not advanced enough. Buy a new one
2009-09-10T03:02:00.000Z	Waseem	Casandrax	err what?
2009-09-10T03:03:00.000Z	Casandrax	Waseem	I thought you wanted to bring downed boxes to life with modem callbacks. Just get a new wireless router then
2009-09-10T03:03:00.000Z	Waseem	Casandrax	I think you have me confused with someone else's request.
2009-09-10T03:04:00.000Z	Casandrax	Waseem	No
2009-09-10T03:05:00.000Z	Casandrax	Waseem	Youll see this later on when you get to work on a bit bigger systems. Have fun!
2009-09-10T03:05:00.000Z	Waseem	Casandrax	you have me mixed up with someone else.
2009-09-10T03:05:00.000Z	Casandrax	Waseem	Youbot
2009-09-10T03:06:00.000Z	Waseem	Casandrax	I have a laptop which keeps freezing with ubuntu..
2009-09-10T03:06:00.000Z	Waseem		and im trying to fix that.
2009-09-10T03:06:00.000Z	Casandrax	Waseem	PCMCIA card ?
2009-09-10T03:07:00.000Z	Waseem	Casandrax	sorry i dont think your a real person, you dont seem to be making any sense to me.
2009-09-10T03:07:00.000Z	Casandrax	Waseem	Get an usb wireless adapter that works with linux
2009-09-10T03:09:00.000Z	Casandrax	Waseem	Im sorry, i think we began at different levels of thought. Me thinking you wanted ISP stuff and you misinterpreted my replies. USB will be much better as PCMCIA is going away and you can move the usb thing to newer computers etc.
2009-09-10T03:10:00.000Z	Waseem	Casandrax	I see, I understand what your saying now. However I have had the wifi adaptor work before and would like to attempt to fix it before purchasing a wifi usb adaptor.
2009-09-10T03:11:00.000Z	Waseem		btw what is the linux kernal?
2009-09-10T03:12:00.000Z	Casandrax	Waseem	Check the messages / syslog and see if there are troubles. Gather as much info/fact as you can and talk to someone with knowledge. If knowledge and you feels its a bug then file a bug report, possibly to the kernel mailinglists. Cant help you more then this atm.
