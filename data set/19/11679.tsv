2006-07-20T16:06:00.000Z	Aesop		Hey, is mail 'n stuff for Thunderbird stored in /home/use/.mozilla-thunderbird? (So, if I copy that folder, will t contain all my mail and settings?)
2006-07-20T05:07:00.000Z	Aesop		Ok, correct me if I'm wrong, but when the Ubuntu installer for Dapper says 'Unable to create a filesystem', that's -bad-.
2006-07-20T05:08:00.000Z	Aesop		Yeah, it was kind of a ironic comment...
2006-07-20T05:08:00.000Z	Aesop		What FS does Ubuntu use? Not Reiser, by any chance?
2006-07-20T05:09:00.000Z	Aesop		Meh, I'd hoped Dapper would use Reiser or other journalling FS
2006-07-20T05:10:00.000Z	gregg__	Aesop	resie isn't exactly known as being stable (though it works stable for many people)
2006-07-20T05:11:00.000Z	gregg__	Aesop	of course :)
2006-07-20T05:11:00.000Z	Aesop	gregg__	Was backing stuff up, forgot to unmount
2006-07-20T05:28:00.000Z	gregg__	Aesop	or ipsec on top of your wlan
2006-07-20T05:28:00.000Z	gregg__	Aesop	AFAIK WPA2/AES is considered secure
2006-07-20T05:29:00.000Z	gregg__	Aesop	so, in consequence every VPN should be considered 'insecure'?
2006-07-20T05:30:00.000Z	Aesop	gregg__	True to a lesser extent. A VPN can still be considered a 'secured environment' but is not secure as a localized network with controlled gateways
2006-07-20T05:31:00.000Z	gregg__	Aesop	well, I'm not talking about 'absolute' security by any means :-)
2006-07-20T05:31:00.000Z	Aesop	gregg__	I'm talking calculated risks- mind if we take this to a private query before we get kicked? =P
2006-07-20T05:32:00.000Z	gregg__	Aesop	I won't mind stop talking about that... :)
2006-07-20T05:37:00.000Z	Aesop	gregg__	I gave you a sort of overview of the arguments about why wireless is generally considered not secure
2006-07-20T05:38:00.000Z	gregg__	Aesop	I don't feel like discussing about a 'serious' topic right now, sorry...
2006-07-20T06:52:00.000Z	gregg__	Aesop	ed
2006-07-20T06:54:00.000Z	gregg__	Aesop	remember, ed is teh standard unix text editor! (-:
