2008-10-16T19:09:00.000Z	_Zeus_		Do you guys have any idea to go to the home folder of the main user on the system?
2008-10-16T19:09:00.000Z	_Zeus_		the best I've thought of so far is cd /home/[^l]*
2008-10-16T19:10:00.000Z	raheem	_Zeus_	it is /home/<username>
2008-10-16T19:10:00.000Z	_Zeus_	raheem	i know that
2008-10-16T19:24:00.000Z	_Zeus_	raheem	what do you mean, looking?
2008-10-16T19:25:00.000Z	_Zeus_	raheem	umm, I really don't get what you're saying.  What do you mean by "Looking for new hardware"
2008-10-16T19:25:00.000Z	raheem	_Zeus_	while booting it just stops  for long time saying detecting hardware ..
2008-10-16T19:26:00.000Z	_Zeus_	raheem	that's not looking for new hardware, it's activating what's in the computer, more than likely
2008-10-16T19:26:00.000Z	_Zeus_	raheem	does this happen every time you boot?
2008-10-16T19:26:00.000Z	raheem	_Zeus_	yes
2008-10-16T19:27:00.000Z	raheem	_Zeus_	mine takes 75-80 seconds
2008-10-16T19:28:00.000Z	_Zeus_	raheem	well, I don't know how to stop that.  Never heard of it
2008-10-16T19:29:00.000Z	raheem	_Zeus_	i am sure my laptop shouldn't take that much time .. looking for a way to tweak it
2008-10-16T19:30:00.000Z	_Zeus_	raheem	how are your specs?
2008-10-16T19:31:00.000Z	raheem	_Zeus_	i think we are on the same boat then
2008-10-16T19:31:00.000Z	_Zeus_	raheem	I think that's normal
2008-10-16T19:31:00.000Z	raheem	_Zeus_	hmm.. my slax on the flash drive takes 35 sec
2008-10-16T19:32:00.000Z	_Zeus_	raheem	have you set the option 'nosplash'?
2008-10-16T19:33:00.000Z	_Zeus_	raheem	check out dmesh
