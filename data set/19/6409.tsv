2010-03-02T00:48:00.000Z	erUSUL	jenia	known bug. search in launchpad and you wil se several reports
2011-02-07T16:51:00.000Z	erUSUL	jenia	some people install the fusion-icon and add it to the startup apps
2011-02-07T18:43:00.000Z	erUSUL	jenia	chose a different theme for the window manager?
2011-02-07T18:44:00.000Z	jenia	erUSUL	I tried them all, nothing changes
2011-02-07T18:45:00.000Z	erUSUL	jenia	maybe your compiz configuration has 100% transparency enabled for window borders ? checked in compiz settings? or just removing compiz configuration?
2011-02-07T18:46:00.000Z	jenia	erUSUL	I change them when compiz is on, the theme's frame and title bar don't change. It keeps staying invisible with those 3 buttons on the right. When I turn compiz off, I can see that the theme changed, when I turn compiz back on, the titlebar goes away again and the 3 buttons become visible floating to the right.
2011-02-07T18:46:00.000Z	erUSUL	jenia	i understand.
2011-02-07T18:47:00.000Z	jenia	erUSUL	do you mean deleting .compiz folder from the home folder?
2011-02-07T18:47:00.000Z	erUSUL	jenia	for example
2011-02-07T18:47:00.000Z	erUSUL	jenia	and/or ~/.config/compiz/
2011-02-07T18:50:00.000Z	jenia	erUSUL	thanx, I will try
2011-02-07T19:04:00.000Z	jenia	erUSUL	if anybody would like to know, in order for compiz to work right, gtk window manager has to have compositing turned off. I turned it off, and my titlebar problem disappeard. I found it out from a program, called compiz-check. During testing, it told me that compositing has to be off, if I want for compiz to work ok.
2011-02-19T18:04:00.000Z	erUSUL	jenia	System>Preferences>appearance||effects tab.
2011-02-19T18:06:00.000Z	jenia	erUSUL	It doesn't work, I change it in effects, then when I restart computer, or logout-logon from-to gnome, the effects are off again and I have to turn it on again. Maybe there is some config file I can check.
2011-02-19T18:07:00.000Z	erUSUL	jenia	brute force solution. install and use fusion-icon
