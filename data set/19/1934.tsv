2012-04-01T17:42:00.000Z	marsfligth		Does 'umount' command to empties the trash on removable devices while it is executing? Or to empty the trash i have to use 'rm' or some specific tool? The trash folders that I mean are '.Trash-1000' and '.Trash-0'. Thanks
2012-04-01T17:44:00.000Z	marsfligth		Thanks escott
2012-04-01T17:44:00.000Z	Dr_willis	marsfligth	 unmount as far as i know does not touch the trash. its when you use the gnome gui. it checks the trash
2012-04-01T17:45:00.000Z	Dr_willis	marsfligth	 each trash is  .trash-user-uid-number. so things in .trash-0 are what root deleted.
2012-04-01T17:45:00.000Z	Dr_willis	marsfligth	 the default user is uid 1000.
2012-04-01T17:46:00.000Z	Dr_willis	marsfligth	 not that ive ever noticed.
2012-05-09T15:57:00.000Z	Dr_willis	marsfligth	 'reccomended' as a way of idiot-proofing things for users that have no idea what 32bit vs 64bit means.
2012-05-09T15:57:00.000Z	Dr_willis	marsfligth	 if you got 64bit hardware. use 64bit.
2012-05-09T16:13:00.000Z	Dr_willis	marsfligth	 its suggested that way - to  make sure people get somthing that at least works..  its a known 'point of debate' and  its mainly a form of idiot-proofing.
2012-05-09T16:14:00.000Z	Dr_willis	marsfligth	 theres talk of changeing it to 64bit reccomended..
2012-05-09T16:20:00.000Z	marsfligth	Dr_willis	thanks for answering, but, I don' think that is an idiot point. to choose the right OS version it is the base, I think. so, I hope that Ubuntu makes a note close to the download button, that advise people with more than 3 GB of memory in total (RAM + video adapter), choose the 64-bit for a better Ubuntu experience. Do you agree?
2012-05-09T16:20:00.000Z	Dr_willis	marsfligth	 they are 'idiot proofing'  not an idiot point...
2012-05-09T16:21:00.000Z	marsfligth	Dr_willis	sorry, I'w wrong
2012-05-09T16:21:00.000Z	Dr_willis	marsfligth	 most of the chats on the topic agree that  they should put forthe the effort to 'educate' the users - but people seem to get scared by 'techy terms and stuff like that'
2012-05-09T16:26:00.000Z	marsfligth	Dr_willis	I'll use 64, absolutely. i was just speaking about the confusion that a new user finds when is choosing what to download. to me, close to the download button, should be a hyperlink or a note, that in few words helps the new Ubuntu user to choose for the better
2012-05-09T16:27:00.000Z	Dr_willis	marsfligth	 with that logic everything would have 1000+ notes. :) and the company is trying harder and harder to make things as simple.. BEST would be for the installer to decide. :) but the move to pae-kernel makes it less of an actual issue.
2012-05-09T16:29:00.000Z	marsfligth	Dr_willis	should be interesting to put a java applet or some exe to check the system before to download, assuming that the new users come from m$. asus has something like that in his driver download page
2012-08-05T00:26:00.000Z	Dr_willis	marsfligth	 a soft link works that way.
2012-08-05T00:39:00.000Z	marsfligth	Dr_willis	and openvoid: Thanks for helping
