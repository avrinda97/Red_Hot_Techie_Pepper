2011-09-18T16:01:00.000Z	makro		Can anyone help me with my 'no sound' issue? The card seems be be o.k. I read some googled tutorials but I don't know how to fix, still

2011-09-18T16:04:00.000Z	makro	netyire	I did that tutorial to the 'alsa' script point. Everything seems to be ok, but no sound. Will I have to install manually?
2011-09-18T16:05:00.000Z	makro	netyire	I pasted the output from the alsa script above. Would you be so kind to have a look at it?
2011-09-18T16:06:00.000Z	netyire	makro	I make no promises makro, but I'll take a look -- it might be something easy I can help you fix :-D
2011-09-18T16:07:00.000Z	makro	netyire	I hope so... Maybe we're licky. Here the link again: http://www.alsa-project.org/db/?f=b3c34d5cc74b3b55a8fa97b948472101623978e9
2011-09-18T16:10:00.000Z	netyire	makro	looks normal, the dmesg log doesn't have any alsa-related error messages
2011-09-18T16:11:00.000Z	netyire	makro	has sound ever worked on your current setup?
2011-09-18T16:11:00.000Z	netyire	makro	the pulseaudio system loses sound sometimes, killall pulseaudio and an application restart usually fixes this
2011-09-18T16:11:00.000Z	makro	netyire	no, it's a vitgin 11.4 install. On my old system (linux, too) sound worked correctly
2011-09-18T16:13:00.000Z	netyire	makro	hmm, the link https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshooting isn't so much a script as a series of steps to fix audio issues, did you follow the troubleshooting tips?
2011-09-18T16:14:00.000Z	makro	netyire	Yes, I did follow the tutorial step by step, until the point 'alsa-script'. In did not do the 'manual install' part
2011-09-18T16:14:00.000Z	makro	netyire	killing and restarting pulseaudio did not fix the isue
2011-09-18T16:15:00.000Z	netyire	makro	I'm looking at the page, is alsa script mentioned here? I get no results on the keyword
2011-09-18T16:17:00.000Z	makro	netyire	I refer to the topic: Is ALSA using the correct model?
2011-09-18T16:19:00.000Z	netyire	makro	enter those two items under the options line in the alsa-configuration.txt and run sudo alsa force-reload
2011-09-18T16:24:00.000Z	netyire	makro	I'm running 11.04 too, if you're having any trouble locating the files listed in the troubleshooting guide just holler and I'll be right on it :-)
2011-09-18T16:31:00.000Z	makro	netyire	I added the line 'options snd-hda-intel model=3stack-digout' to /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf and restarted alsa. No effect. What this the action you meant?
2011-09-18T16:38:00.000Z	makro	netyire	Sorry, I have to go. Thank you for helping, so long. I'll retry later
