2006-01-23T08:24:00.000Z	ToRTuReD_X		go null
2006-01-23T08:24:00.000Z	jbzz	ToRTuReD_X	 the mount command that is used should include the option   -o  umask=0000,dmask=0000,fmask=0000    that will mount as 777
2006-01-23T08:24:00.000Z	ToRTuReD_X	jbzz	- i used the fdick mount script >_>
2006-01-23T08:42:00.000Z	jbzz	ToRTuReD_X	  so copy your files to /media/hdb1   and they will go to the mounted hard drive at that location
2006-01-23T08:44:00.000Z	ToRTuReD_X	jbzz	still get a copy error
2006-01-23T08:46:00.000Z	jbzz	ToRTuReD_X	  Is it an NTFS filesystem on that hard drive?    You are correct.  Cannot write to that.   Is there any unpartitioned room on that hard drive?
2006-01-23T08:46:00.000Z	jbzz	ToRTuReD_X	  timfrost is heading in the correct direction.
2006-01-23T08:47:00.000Z	ToRTuReD_X	jbzz	yeh i know but i can't format this so any way of installing a burner?
2006-01-23T08:48:00.000Z	jbzz	ToRTuReD_X	 I have not done so.  Do you plan on sharing files often win a Windows machine?
2006-01-23T08:48:00.000Z	jbzz	ToRTuReD_X	 often WITH a Windows machine
