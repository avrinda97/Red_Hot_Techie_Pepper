2011-02-10T13:35:00.000Z	RandomCake		Hi, I'm running ubuntu 10.10, and a few weeks ago I applied some updates, one of which I believe was a kernel update, since then my computer won't boot into Ubuntu, it stops on 'checking battery state...', I have an NVidia GForce 310M, and an i5 processor (so two graphics chips), I think I had the additional non-free grahics drivers Ubuntu pushed at me, how can I begin to fix the problem?
2011-02-10T13:37:00.000Z	pepee	RandomCake	tried running the laptop on AC?
2011-02-10T13:37:00.000Z	RandomCake	pepee	yes, it's plugged into the mains charger
2011-02-10T13:40:00.000Z	pepee	RandomCake	remove the intel driver/s from apt-get
2011-02-10T13:40:00.000Z	RandomCake	pepee	I'd love to, but I've not got past the 'Checking battery state...'
2011-02-10T13:40:00.000Z	pepee	RandomCake	ahh
2011-02-10T13:41:00.000Z	pepee	RandomCake	you need to edit some entries in grub, and add "init=/bin/bash"
2011-02-10T13:41:00.000Z	pepee	RandomCake	remove quiet and splah
2011-02-10T13:44:00.000Z	pepee	RandomCake	do this: reboot the machine. in grub, press 'e' and then 'c', do what I told you, and then run linux (ctrl+x IIRC)
2011-02-10T13:44:00.000Z	pepee	RandomCake	yes, do it
2011-02-10T13:47:00.000Z	pepee	RandomCake	hmm remove either the free one (nouveau?) or the non-free (nvidia-something)
2011-02-10T13:49:00.000Z	pepee	RandomCake	ubuntu shouldn't have this kind of problems
2011-02-10T13:51:00.000Z	pepee	RandomCake	it depends on a lot of things... don't know about this particular case...
2011-02-10T13:53:00.000Z	pepee	RandomCake	I don't really know...
2011-02-10T13:56:00.000Z	pepee	RandomCake	did it work?. perhaps the free drivers are interferring with the nonfree
2011-02-10T14:00:00.000Z	pepee	RandomCake	just install either the free or the non-free, I think X shoud reconfigure itself
2011-02-10T14:05:00.000Z	pepee	RandomCake	no need to reinstall, this is not windows :)
2011-02-10T14:10:00.000Z	pepee	RandomCake	you can remove the config file, X will try to load the best config it can
2011-02-10T14:15:00.000Z	pepee	RandomCake	you are welcome
