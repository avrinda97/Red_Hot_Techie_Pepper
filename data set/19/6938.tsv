2011-09-19T06:46:00.000Z	UbuntuBrandon		I like what Ubuntu is *trying* to do. Just not the way they are going about it.
2011-09-19T06:47:00.000Z	UbuntuBrandon		But I use it because regardless of Unity, I set everything how I like it.
2011-09-19T06:47:00.000Z	UbuntuBrandon		I have the codecs and VLC no problem.
2011-09-19T06:48:00.000Z	UbuntuBrandon		I think that they have a LOT of compatibility issues to work out.
2011-09-19T06:49:00.000Z	UbuntuBrandon		Yea they come with the Restricteds that you can mark for installation on setup.
2011-09-19T06:49:00.000Z	UbuntuBrandon		-Running Ubuntu Studio on a VM, but in Ubuntu right now. Doing a review of studio later tonight.
2011-09-19T06:50:00.000Z	UbuntuBrandon		That is Odd, Primary...
2011-09-19T06:50:00.000Z	UbuntuBrandon		One moment primary,
2011-09-19T06:52:00.000Z	UbuntuBrandon		Primary, I am going to link you to a help page, with the commands you need.
2011-09-19T06:52:00.000Z	UbuntuBrandon		First do you have 64 or 32-bit?
2011-09-19T06:52:00.000Z	primary	UbuntuBrandon	64
2011-09-19T06:40:00.000Z	primary	UbuntuBrandon	I'll see, is that a repository?
2011-09-19T06:49:00.000Z	primary	UbuntuBrandon	I still cannot play wma through vlc, moc, or mplayer
2011-09-19T06:50:00.000Z	primary	UbuntuBrandon	parole media player(gstreamer(?) came with xubuntu) complains about plugins needed
2011-09-19T06:56:00.000Z	primary	UbuntuBrandon	"Package w64codecs is not available, but is referred to by another package. This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or is only available from another source."
2011-09-19T06:56:00.000Z	primary	UbuntuBrandon	what howto are you looking at
2011-09-19T07:02:00.000Z	primary	UbuntuBrandon	so I did all that, installed the w64codecs, enabled medibuntu and installed its mplayer + avcodec, and I still get "Requested audio codec family [wma9dmo] (afm=dmo) not available.". Enable it at compilation. Should I just grab the source and compile it? Jesus christ.
2011-09-19T07:04:00.000Z	primary	UbuntuBrandon	I did not encode these, and if I want to even make use of these I need to transcode them into another format. I prefer Xiph's Vorbis.
2011-09-19T07:05:00.000Z	primary	UbuntuBrandon	You do not have to be sorry, I'll just compile.
