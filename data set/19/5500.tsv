2008-12-03T04:47:00.000Z	heogen		open file .sit in ubuntu?
2008-12-03T04:48:00.000Z	slayton	heogen	what are .sit files
2008-12-03T06:55:00.000Z	slayton	heogen	your !offtopic
2008-12-03T06:56:00.000Z	slayton	heogen	talking about a game?
2008-12-03T06:57:00.000Z	slayton	heogen	 if you have a question about how to get the game working or something like that ,but asking people if they know a certain game is offtopic.....
2008-12-03T06:57:00.000Z	slayton	heogen	that is a good question how to install a game in ubuntu
2008-12-03T06:58:00.000Z	slayton	heogen	right so then the appropriate question would be to ask "Is bugdom in the ubuntu repositories"
2008-12-03T06:58:00.000Z	slayton	heogen	the etiquette is to ask questions about a problem and see if people know how to solve the problem
2008-12-03T06:58:00.000Z	slayton	heogen	it doesn't appear that there is a linux version of bugdom
2008-12-03T06:59:00.000Z	slayton	heogen	neither in the repos or available for installation from source either
2008-12-04T06:06:00.000Z	slayton	heogen	what do you mean? explain your problem
2008-12-04T06:07:00.000Z	slayton	heogen	right I get that but what is the file type what is the error you're getting
2008-12-04T06:07:00.000Z	slayton	heogen	I need more information then "the movie won't play"
2008-12-04T06:07:00.000Z	slayton	heogen	the more specific you can make your question the better
2008-12-04T06:10:00.000Z	slayton	heogen	what is the file type?
2008-12-04T06:14:00.000Z	slayton	heogen	what do you mean by changeroot?
2008-12-04T06:16:00.000Z	slayton	heogen	sorry don't know what the problem is
