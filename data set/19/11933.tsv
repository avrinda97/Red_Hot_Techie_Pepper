2006-09-29T05:30:00.000Z	TrevorT		could someone tell me why the xorg-driver-fglrx package is enabled for dapper-amd64 and is completely useless?

2006-09-29T05:32:00.000Z	TrevorT		really should be taken out of the package tree ...
2006-09-29T05:32:00.000Z	TrevorT		or someone should put a hold on working on edgy until you have a *working* stable release of dapper...
2006-09-29T05:33:00.000Z	TrevorT		just in case nobody heard me the past 5 times

2006-09-29T05:33:00.000Z	TrevorT		that's absurd, what's the point?
2006-09-29T05:34:00.000Z	TrevorT		then what are you? why do you exist??
2006-09-29T05:34:00.000Z	LjL	TrevorT	to give voluntary support?
2006-09-29T05:34:00.000Z	TrevorT	thoreauputic	you have a misinterpretation of attitude problem :)
2006-09-29T05:35:00.000Z	TrevorT		but towards what end? you're supporting something that isn't even stable.. and hasn't been for some time now
2006-09-29T05:35:00.000Z	TrevorT	thoreauputic	you seem to have my disposition confused with someone who is mad..
2006-09-29T05:35:00.000Z	LjL	TrevorT	are you just being a troll? if so, just go away...
2006-09-29T05:35:00.000Z	TrevorT		I'm just irritated at the situation :)
2006-09-29T05:36:00.000Z	TrevorT	thoreauputic	you're very presumptious
2006-09-29T05:36:00.000Z	LjL	TrevorT	we're supporting ubuntu because we like it, wether it's stable or not, and would like people to use it and be happy with it. on the other hand, nobody's *forcing* us to help anybody, nor is anybody *paying* us. if we know, and we're looking, and feel like, we answer, otherwise we don't.
2006-09-29T05:36:00.000Z	LjL	TrevorT	if you don't like that, well, buy paid support! that's what those companies exist for...
