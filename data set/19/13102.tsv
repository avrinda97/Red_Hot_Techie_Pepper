2005-05-24T07:00:00.000Z	jeffco		By the way, i have XINE.
2005-05-24T07:02:00.000Z	jeffco		mirv, i read the page, and it has a heading called Windows media audio, but no instructionns.
2005-05-24T07:04:00.000Z	jeffco		mirv, how do i load up rhythmbox?
2005-05-24T07:06:00.000Z	stuNNed	jeffco	you need the gstreamer mad plugin right?
2005-05-24T07:06:00.000Z	jeffco	stuNNed	do i ?
2005-05-24T07:07:00.000Z	stuNNed	jeffco	yes, think so
2005-05-24T07:13:00.000Z	jeffco	stuNNed	accdng to synaptic, i've already downloaded gstreamer0.8-mad.
2005-05-24T07:14:00.000Z	stuNNed	jeffco	did you commit your download in synaptic?
2005-05-24T07:14:00.000Z	stuNNed	jeffco	that will be only for mp3 afaik
2005-05-24T07:14:00.000Z	stuNNed	jeffco	you want to play .wma's in rb?
2005-05-24T07:16:00.000Z	stuNNed	jeffco	you will need nonfree proprietary codecs to play DRM'd .wma's
2005-05-24T07:16:00.000Z	stuNNed	jeffco	win32codecs and mplayerplug-in should do it for firefox
2005-05-24T07:16:00.000Z	stuNNed	jeffco	did you see the restricted formats page on the wiki?
2005-05-24T07:17:00.000Z	jeffco	stuNNed	yes. and then i came here to get additional assistance. that page wasn't clear for me.
2005-05-24T07:17:00.000Z	jeffco	stuNNed	i can't find "win32codecs" in synaptic.
2005-05-24T07:17:00.000Z	stuNNed	jeffco	you need to add the repositories that will give you access to the codecs
2005-05-24T07:18:00.000Z	jeffco	stuNNed	i have all multi and universe added already. could it be that it has a different name?
2005-05-24T07:19:00.000Z	stuNNed	jeffco	w32codecs aren't in multi and universe
