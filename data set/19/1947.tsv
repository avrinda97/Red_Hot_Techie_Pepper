2010-08-23T00:20:00.000Z	duffydack	Strashniq	I know someone with SIS that works fine.   Did you use the LIVE cd or the alternate cd
2010-08-23T00:21:00.000Z	Strashniq	duffydack	i tried them both - i guess my SIS VGA is very very old
2010-08-23T00:21:00.000Z	Strashniq	duffydack	i tried both latest and 9.04 version
2010-08-23T00:21:00.000Z	Strashniq		both desktop and
2010-08-23T00:22:00.000Z	duffydack	Strashniq	did you try the extra options before booting it?  noapic etc
2010-08-23T00:22:00.000Z	duffydack	Strashniq	press a key when you boot the cd to get a menu, then (F6 I think) to get more options.
2010-08-23T00:22:00.000Z	Strashniq	duffydack	i will try and join later
