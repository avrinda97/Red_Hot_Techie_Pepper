2005-06-18T10:25:00.000Z	ekCo_		hey i got a huge problem
2005-06-18T10:25:00.000Z	ekCo_		i went to install my linux drivers..
2005-06-18T10:25:00.000Z	ekCo_		and it killed gdm
2005-06-18T10:25:00.000Z	ekCo_		and all traces of it
2005-06-18T10:25:00.000Z	ekCo_		im stuck in the terminal..
2005-06-18T10:25:00.000Z	ekCo_		nvidia drivers soz
2005-06-18T10:26:00.000Z	bob2	ekCo_	following the howto on the wiki, you mean?
2005-06-18T10:27:00.000Z	bob2	ekCo_	"new drivers"?
2005-06-18T10:28:00.000Z	bob2	ekCo_	the packages mentioned on the wiki do not remove gdm
2005-06-18T10:29:00.000Z	bob2	ekCo_	why did you let apt remove gdm, anyway?
2005-06-18T10:30:00.000Z	bob2	ekCo_	and where did you get these packages from?
2005-06-18T10:31:00.000Z	ekCo_	bob2	it then install the drivers
2005-06-18T10:31:00.000Z	bob2	ekCo_	http://www.ubuntulinux.org/community/conduct
2005-06-18T10:32:00.000Z	bob2	ekCo_	also, before this, you were running a normal system, with no silly binary drivers?
2005-06-18T10:32:00.000Z	bob2	ekCo_	but why are you doing that?
2005-06-18T10:33:00.000Z	bob2	ekCo_	so, install the "ubuntu-desktop" package
2005-06-18T10:34:00.000Z	bob2	ekCo_	indeed
2005-06-18T10:34:00.000Z	bob2	ekCo_	I don't know what a "skin" is
2005-06-18T10:40:00.000Z	bob2	ekCo_	it's really way way better to stay with the ubuntu drivers
