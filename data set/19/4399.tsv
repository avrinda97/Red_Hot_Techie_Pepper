2009-01-24T18:05:00.000Z	jero	ubuntuteen	- far from it. I only start developing some java and a tiny amount of c
2009-01-24T18:05:00.000Z	ubuntuteen		jero:some plugin's are not installed by default which making it hard to guess which pugin;s to use
2009-01-24T18:05:00.000Z	ubuntuteen	jero	i am 3rd year computer student
2009-01-24T18:05:00.000Z	jero	ubuntuteen	- the problem with IDEs for c is telling them where to look for libraries and which compiler /linker to use - once you figured that out, all is fine
