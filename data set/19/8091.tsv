2007-08-30T15:40:00.000Z	ziroday	Bo1	okay well there is two ways to do that. There is "ghosting" which is copying your entire installation and "AptonCD" which will copy all your programs onto the cd
2007-08-30T15:42:00.000Z	ziroday	Bo1	well the most well known program for that is "Norton Ghost" however there is also Partimage which is a free open source alternative
2007-08-30T15:43:00.000Z	ziroday	Bo1	i reccomend Norton Ghost as it has good language support and is well known/supported and works very well
2007-08-30T15:45:00.000Z	ziroday	Bo1	so which one do you wnat to use - Norton Ghost or Partimage
2007-08-30T15:48:00.000Z	ziroday	Bo1	you have to pay for norton however there are other sort of legal ways of getting it do you want me to help you with that
2007-08-30T15:49:00.000Z	ziroday	Bo1	please go to #getnorton on freenode :)
