2007-08-28T11:22:00.000Z	keelvarra		could anyone recomend a good 3d moddelling tool for linux?
2007-08-28T11:23:00.000Z	keelvarra		i tried blendler, and I really don't like it, I really like maya but I'm looking for a free solution
2007-08-28T11:24:00.000Z	leo_rockw	keelvarra	wings 3d? k-3d? but i never tried those
2007-08-28T11:25:00.000Z	leo_rockw	keelvarra	i never tried maya. i tried 3dsm and lightwave and imho blender + yafray is as good as those 2
2007-08-28T11:25:00.000Z	leo_rockw	keelvarra	really good fluid animation too
2007-08-28T11:26:00.000Z	keelvarra	leo_rockw	I just can't get used to the blender interface, i have given it an honest try and find it to be incrediblly hard compared to maya or max3d
2007-08-28T11:27:00.000Z	leo_rockw	keelvarra	that is true. but i was coming from lightwave, so it felt really easy for me.
2007-08-28T11:28:00.000Z	leo_rockw	keelvarra	i have a friend that's into opensource like i am and you can't move him from 3dsm
2007-08-28T11:28:00.000Z	leo_rockw	keelvarra	you can check in winehq.org how maya runs on wine
2007-08-28T11:29:00.000Z	keelvarra	leo_rockw	maya is suppossed to run fine, I just don't have that kind of money right now
2007-08-28T11:30:00.000Z	leo_rockw	keelvarra	oh, i thought you already had it. well, i learned the basics of blender in one week. if you follow the wiki it isn't very hard (particularly since you already know a lot of 3d stuff coming from maya)
2007-08-28T11:31:00.000Z	keelvarra	leo_rockw	well that gives me some hope, I guess I'll give it another shot, do you know of good resources for it?
2007-08-28T11:32:00.000Z	leo_rockw	keelvarra	this one is pretty good: http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro
2007-08-28T11:32:00.000Z	leo_rockw	keelvarra	wiki.blender.org you can check that too
2007-08-28T11:33:00.000Z	leo_rockw	keelvarra	unlike lightwave, there are a LOT of tutorials for blender (it being opensource and everything)
2007-08-28T11:33:00.000Z	leo_rockw	keelvarra	i was still on windoze when i switched to blender cuz it has a better community. a lot of tutorials and people to help you
2007-08-28T11:34:00.000Z	leo_rockw	keelvarra	just make sure you install yafray. blender is not as powerful without it
2007-08-28T11:44:00.000Z	keelvarra	leo_rockw	thanks for the help, about to finish the download
2007-08-28T11:45:00.000Z	leo_rockw	keelvarra	no problem. i've been hanging around here lately so if you have any question just ask me. i'm not a blender guru but...
