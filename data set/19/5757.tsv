2008-07-01T04:51:00.000Z	Tamale	bloodrock	The shares showed up in Gutsy, and I've already rebooted my heron install since installing / configuring samba
2008-07-01T04:52:00.000Z	Tamale	bloodrock	What's a WINS server and do i need that?
2008-07-01T04:52:00.000Z	bloodrock	Tamale	did ya reboot windows
2008-07-01T04:52:00.000Z	Tamale	bloodrock	 Many times
2008-07-01T04:54:00.000Z	bloodrock	Tamale	 did you install system-config-samba
2008-07-01T04:55:00.000Z	Tamale	bloodrock	No, that package wasn't installed.. I just installed it now
2008-07-01T04:55:00.000Z	Tamale	bloodrock	Ah.. now i have some options to configure.. thank you :)
2008-07-01T04:56:00.000Z	bloodrock	Tamale	that should help i too have had probs with seeing the wins share til i installed that
2008-07-01T04:56:00.000Z	Tamale	bloodrock	Neither of my windows computers are showing up yet though in Network
2008-07-01T05:01:00.000Z	bloodrock	Tamale	 in the samba config  under prefrences in it for server settings set it to the name you use on windows for the net group
2008-07-01T05:03:00.000Z	bloodrock	Tamale	also prob wanna check your settings on the windows machine as to how you got the shareing set
2008-07-01T05:03:00.000Z	Tamale	bloodrock	The share i want to access is wide open
2008-07-01T05:04:00.000Z	bloodrock	Tamale	k then it should show up are you seeing anything at all like a workgroup icon
2008-07-01T05:05:00.000Z	bloodrock	Tamale	 did ya click on it
2008-07-01T05:05:00.000Z	bloodrock	Tamale	did ya reboot the windows machine
2008-07-01T05:06:00.000Z	Tamale	bloodrock	Not since installing the samba-config or whatever, but many i've rebooted it many times in general
2008-07-01T05:09:00.000Z	Tamale	bloodrock	Might've found a solution.  Someone else mentioned /etc/nsswitch.conf needing "wins" in the hosts line.   Sure enough, it was missing.  Why was this removed in hardy?
2008-07-01T05:11:00.000Z	bloodrock	Tamale	got me prob outta date and not being updated????
