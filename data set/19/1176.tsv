2011-12-11T23:26:00.000Z	fonix232		guys, got a bit weirdo question
2011-12-11T23:26:00.000Z	fonix232		I just got an external USB HDD tower
2011-12-11T23:27:00.000Z	fonix232		and I would like to have my Ubuntu on it, while Windows stays on internal
2011-12-11T23:28:00.000Z	fonix232		and I would like a way to boot from it with GRUB and selectable windows, but also, as I often carry it around, and I want my PC work without it, but I want this Ubuntu to boot anywhere else. Any idea?
2011-12-11T23:28:00.000Z	dr_willis	fonix232	 you can install to a extenal usb hard drive - be sure to tell grub to install to that drive. if you want it totally seperate from the windows install.
2011-12-11T23:28:00.000Z	dr_willis	fonix232	 thats how it would work :) i do the same thing with my external flash drives
2011-12-11T23:29:00.000Z	fonix232	dr_willis	so you say that it runs instead of the windows loader when the USB drive is connected, but it won't totally overwrite it?
2011-12-11T23:29:00.000Z	dr_willis	fonix232	 be sure grub installs to the external drive.
2011-12-11T23:29:00.000Z	dr_willis	fonix232	 it boots the grub on the flash. that grub has an entry for windows, or the linix install here.
2011-12-11T23:30:00.000Z	fonix232	dr_willis	yes, I had it in mind, but wasn't sure if it would work on other PCs, as on my PC, GRUB always bugged me if I removed an internal drive, or it coulnd't find an entrys device
2011-12-11T23:30:00.000Z	fonix232		like if I had Win7 on hdd2, grub on hdd1 with ubuntu, and removed hdd2, GRUB never loaded
2011-12-11T23:30:00.000Z	dr_willis	fonix232	 you aer not installing grub to the internatl drive.. thats the whoe key.
2011-12-11T23:31:00.000Z	fonix232	dr_willis	yes, but it will still connect the other partitions to it, and such, it will error if it's connected to another PC
2011-12-11T23:31:00.000Z	dr_willis	fonix232	 the windows entry wont work when on a differnt pc. (or they might) the linux entrys will work
2011-12-11T23:32:00.000Z	fonix232	dr_willis	yes I get that, my problem is, if such happens, for me atleast so far, GRUB didn't even load, but ran an emergency terminal
2011-12-11T23:32:00.000Z	dr_willis	fonix232	 IF you install the whole OS and grub to the external Drive.. it should work.
2011-12-11T23:32:00.000Z	fonix232		okay, I'm hoping in it
2011-12-11T23:32:00.000Z	dr_willis	fonix232	 i have 5+ flash drives set up that way
