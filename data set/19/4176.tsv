2009-03-11T14:18:00.000Z	temporarytao	opengyan	what specifically is the problem? what do you mean: "touchpad click is soooooo much embrassing"
2009-03-11T14:19:00.000Z	opengyan	temporarytao	it toubles me while i type ...so i want to 1. disable the double click 2. if possible totally disable if i am typing
2009-03-11T14:19:00.000Z	temporarytao		doesn't your disable touchpad shortcut key work?
2009-03-11T14:20:00.000Z	temporarytao		for me, if i press Fn + F7, the touchpad key locks

2009-03-11T14:20:00.000Z	opengyan	temporarytao	agree it works . but re-enabling is an headache ...and some time the laptop just hangs ...
2009-03-11T14:21:00.000Z	temporarytao	opengyan	i never heard of that software before (sounds like a KDE app)
