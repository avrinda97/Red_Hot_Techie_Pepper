2010-11-23T01:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	techlife	sure is
2010-11-23T01:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	techlife	run: lsusb ,websearch for the 8 character hexid to find guides
2010-11-23T01:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	techlife	the lsusb output will help you
2010-11-23T01:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	techlife	install and run cheese. Do you see yourself?
2010-11-23T01:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	techlife	then lsusb for you, also websearch: ubuntu netbook ,there is an official doc on some netbooks, yours maybelisted
2010-11-23T01:10:00.000Z	techlife	ActionParsnip	i did run lsusb and a bunch of stuff listed but not really sure if the web cam is listed. i also googled but couldn't find anything for this model
2010-11-23T01:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	techlife	try each id in turn, you can ignore the "linux hub" lines
2010-11-23T01:11:00.000Z	techlife	ActionParsnip	r u saying google each id?
2010-11-23T01:11:00.000Z	techlife	ActionParsnip	to find out what it is?
2010-11-23T01:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	techlife	if that's your search tool of choice, sure
2010-11-23T01:12:00.000Z	techlife	ActionParsnip	do i have any easier other options?
2010-11-23T01:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	techlife	yes, one will be the cam, its attached to the usb bus
2010-11-23T01:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	techlife	could websearch the model in conjunction with ubuntu to find guides maybe
2010-11-23T01:14:00.000Z	techlife	ActionParsnip	1005hab
2010-11-23T01:14:00.000Z	techlife	ActionParsnip	the listing for the lsusb is jibirish
2010-11-23T01:20:00.000Z	techlife	ActionParsnip	i'm referring to the builtin web cam and not an external webcam
2010-11-23T01:29:00.000Z	techlife	ActionParsnip	thnx for that command..real handy..unfortunately it lists all the usb connections but no indication which one belongs to the webcam
2010-11-23T01:41:00.000Z	techlife	ActionParsnip	thnx for all ur help but i don't think that we are going to have any luck with this..I will just have through xp back on there..thnx anyways..
