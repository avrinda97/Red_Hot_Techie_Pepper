2007-01-15T06:39:00.000Z	juano	gnomenoob	what seems to be the problem?
2007-01-15T06:41:00.000Z	juano	gnomenoob	is there any error message?
2007-01-15T06:41:00.000Z	juano	gnomenoob	at what point does it hang?
2007-01-15T06:42:00.000Z	juano	gnomenoob	you can try sudo mv ~/.gnome ~/.gnome.bak, this will move your settings to another file and start up with a clean fresh one
2007-01-15T06:43:00.000Z	juano	gnomenoob	you can try what i told you, sometimes it helps with those issues
2007-01-15T06:46:00.000Z	juano	gnomenoob	remember that after doing sudo mv ~/,gnome ~/.gnome.bak you can restore it renaming gnome.bak to .gnome
2007-01-15T06:48:00.000Z	juano	gnomenoob	yes, you dont reboot, just press ctrl + alt + backspace to restart X-server
2007-01-15T06:50:00.000Z	juano	gnomenoob	any luck?
2007-01-15T06:51:00.000Z	juano	gnomenoob	sudo is to make superuser actions
2007-01-15T06:51:00.000Z	juano	gnomenoob	mv = Move yep
2007-01-15T06:52:00.000Z	juano	gnomenoob	basically what your doing is moving your gnome settings file for this session to a backup file momentarely to start fresh over
2007-01-15T06:56:00.000Z	juano	gnomenoob	sudo mv yourhomeuserdir/.gnome yourhomeuserdir/.gnome.bak
2007-01-15T06:58:00.000Z	juano	gnomenoob	try this in your home dir:  ls -a | grep ".gnome*"
2007-01-15T07:01:00.000Z	juano	gnomenoob	weird, you should have .gnome
2007-01-15T07:02:00.000Z	juano	gnomenoob	hold on 1 sec
