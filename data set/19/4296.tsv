2011-08-10T19:48:00.000Z	dhruvasagar		Hi, I did a fresh install of 11.04, I notice that videos (on vlc) often gets stuck on frames, the audio moves smoothly, just the video jitters often
2011-08-10T19:49:00.000Z	mordof	dhruvasagar	have you tried other video players?
2011-08-10T19:49:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	mordof	no...
2011-08-10T19:49:00.000Z	mordof	dhruvasagar	give them a try
2011-08-10T19:50:00.000Z	mordof	dhruvasagar	some players respond differently for different filetypes
2011-08-10T19:50:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	mordof	hmmm but can't I fix vlc ?
2011-08-10T19:50:00.000Z	mordof	dhruvasagar	maybe, maybe not.. i don't know what the problem is
2011-08-10T19:50:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	mordof	totem seems to be doing better
2011-08-10T19:51:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	mordof	totem isn't doing fine
2011-08-10T19:51:00.000Z	mordof	dhruvasagar	mplayer has always worked for me
2011-08-10T19:51:00.000Z	mordof	dhruvasagar	i use that for most files, simply because totem won't work for some
2011-08-10T19:51:00.000Z	mordof	dhruvasagar	and i plain don't like vlc
2011-08-10T19:52:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	mordof	why? i've been using vlc for a very long long time
2011-08-10T19:52:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	mordof	installing mplayer, haven't used it so much
2011-08-10T19:52:00.000Z	mordof	dhruvasagar	on windows i always used media player classic. i guess just because vlc has never worked as well, i don't consider it to be that great
2011-08-10T19:53:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	mordof	vlc has actually always worked well for me
2011-08-10T19:53:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	mordof	although the new system i've bought has been giving me some troubles with respect to the graphics card drivers (nvidia), so somehow I feel that is responsible
2011-08-10T19:54:00.000Z	mordof	dhruvasagar	hm. can't help with much of the technical problems. with stuff like this if i find an alternative is working fine, i simply use that
2011-08-10T19:55:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	mordof	trying that myself
