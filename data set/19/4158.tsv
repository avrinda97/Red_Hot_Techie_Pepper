2010-03-13T23:16:00.000Z	collind		hey everyone, i was in here yesterday with a grub problem on 9.10 of grub not finding windows 7. i researched it a bit more, but no solutions have worked.
2010-03-13T23:18:00.000Z	collind		has anyone had a similar problem?
2010-03-13T23:20:00.000Z	collind		could anyone help me out? i really dont want to lose my windows install..
2010-03-13T23:21:00.000Z	collind		Alright: Just installed 9.10 onto a system with Windows 7. Grub is not recognizing Win7, therefore I cannot boot into it. I have tried many solution, but nothing seems to work.
2010-03-13T23:22:00.000Z	acicula	collind	did it create an entry for windows 7 ?
2010-03-13T23:22:00.000Z	acicula	collind	are you using grub2?
2010-03-13T23:24:00.000Z	acicula	collind	whats the output of upgrate-grub can you post it to pastebin
2010-03-13T23:26:00.000Z	acicula	collind	did you resize the windows partition in order to install ubuntu?
2010-03-13T23:28:00.000Z	acicula	collind	win7 is /dev/sda1 and ubuntu /dev/sda2 (or lower) ?, can you access the win7 disk from ubuntu?
2010-03-13T23:33:00.000Z	acicula	collind	can you access the windows disk from ubuntu
2010-03-13T23:35:00.000Z	acicula	collind	it should be visibile under places
2010-03-13T23:35:00.000Z	acicula	collind	as suspected
2010-03-13T23:35:00.000Z	acicula	collind	you can try to manually mount /dev/sda1
2010-03-13T23:37:00.000Z	acicula	collind	does it give an error
2010-03-13T23:40:00.000Z	acicula	collind	err , nvm
2010-03-13T23:40:00.000Z	acicula	collind	the problem is your windows install is a bit dysfunctional
2010-03-13T23:40:00.000Z	acicula	collind	what you need to do is boot a win7 disc, run recovery and do a disk check, this will destroy grub again(yay), but afterwards you can boot the livecd of ubuntu and fix grub again
2010-03-13T23:41:00.000Z	acicula	collind	there are some shortcuts to be made , but this is the most foolproof approach i can recommend, fix window7 and make sure it boots, then fix grub
2010-03-13T23:42:00.000Z	acicula	collind	also refer to the dualboot wiki on recovering ubuntu after installing windows
