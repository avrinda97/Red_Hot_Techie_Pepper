2006-05-12T13:24:00.000Z	romenov		Could someone give me a hand with keyboard problems?
2006-05-12T13:24:00.000Z	brandon_	romenov	what problem are you having?
2006-05-12T13:27:00.000Z	brandon_	romenov	normally, that woulod be an xmodmap file
2006-05-12T13:31:00.000Z	romenov	brandon_	: is there a command like sudo keyboardmap to change it to belgium?
2006-05-12T13:32:00.000Z	brandon_	romenov	run the command xmodmap /usr/share/xmodmap/xmodmap.br
2006-05-12T13:33:00.000Z	brandon_	romenov	not sudo
2006-05-12T13:33:00.000Z	brandon_	romenov	you just loaded what i believe is the keyboard layout for your country
2006-05-12T13:34:00.000Z	brandon_	romenov	what country was it again?
2006-05-12T13:34:00.000Z	brandon_	romenov	wouldn't that be a french layout?
2006-05-12T13:36:00.000Z	brandon_	romenov	there's a few french layouts. there's .fr .fr-2 .fr_x86
2006-05-12T13:39:00.000Z	brandon_	romenov	that's about all i know about it. the only other thing you can do is make your own map
2006-05-12T13:40:00.000Z	brandon_	romenov	you can run the previous script with .us to return it to normal
2006-05-12T13:41:00.000Z	brandon_	romenov	you can also see the list of modmaps if you browse to /usr/share/xmodmap
2006-05-12T13:42:00.000Z	brandon_	romenov	sure you can. you can apply any key layout using the xmodmap program and pointing it to the location of the map
2006-05-12T13:42:00.000Z	brandon_	romenov	i use it to properly configure my remote control using a custom map i made
2006-05-12T13:43:00.000Z	brandon_	romenov	it's just a script that you run using the command "xmodmap /path/to/map"
2006-05-12T13:43:00.000Z	brandon_	romenov	which is what you've been doing
2006-05-12T13:44:00.000Z	brandon_	romenov	if you restart, the default map will be applied
2006-05-12T13:49:00.000Z	brandon_	romenov	awesome
