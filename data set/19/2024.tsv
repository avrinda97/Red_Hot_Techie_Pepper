2011-06-23T01:42:00.000Z	shorttech		can anyone help with dual monitor support?
2011-06-23T01:44:00.000Z	shorttech		teal I have an nvidia driver and Im trying to set up my second monitor
2011-06-23T01:44:00.000Z	shorttech		teal currently Im using the driver assigned by ubuntu when I did the installation. I ran nvidia-settings already and when I activated xinerema I had problems
2011-06-23T01:45:00.000Z	coz_	shorttech	  open nvidia settings..click the "X Server Display Configuration"   click the secondary monitor image  configure-twinview- resolution
2011-06-23T01:45:00.000Z	coz_	shorttech	 if you want that to be permanent  open  sudo nvidia-settings and make the changes    write x configuration file
2011-06-23T01:49:00.000Z	coz_	shorttech	  it should easily accept it,, are you using your regular user login name and password?
2011-06-23T01:51:00.000Z	shorttech	coz_	but when I did the install it did not ask me for a root password
2011-06-23T01:51:00.000Z	shorttech	coz_	I just dont understand... Im coming from Mandriva and I used to be able to go into grub log in and use su when necessary, but now I cant even log in
2011-06-23T01:51:00.000Z	coz_	shorttech	 no root password  there in ctrl+alt+F1    hit that  ,, use your regular user nick,, regular password,, if you want root access type  sudo -i  then use regular user password
2011-06-23T01:53:00.000Z	shorttech	coz_	the problem is that when I press ctrl+alt+F1  and type my user and pass it doesnt work
2011-06-23T01:54:00.000Z	shorttech	coz_	I keep getting login incorrect
2011-06-23T01:54:00.000Z	coz_	shorttech	 mm  there should be no issue with that... you dont have caps lock on or anything...yes
2011-06-23T01:56:00.000Z	coz_	shorttech	 you could go to /system/preferences/about me   change your password  to see if that is the issue
2011-06-23T01:56:00.000Z	shorttech	coz_	no I dont have caps or anything like that... It does seems odd that I see a long txt when ctrl+alt+F1  is pressed. I see shorttech-System-Product-Name Login:
2011-06-23T01:56:00.000Z	shorttech	coz_	does that looks normal? By the way I already changed the password
2011-06-23T01:57:00.000Z	coz_	shorttech	 hmm  let me see if I can find something   no that doesn look normal
2011-06-23T02:00:00.000Z	coz_	shorttech	 which version of ubuntu is this?
2011-06-23T02:02:00.000Z	coz_	shorttech	 I am finding "nothing" on this particular issue
2011-06-23T02:02:00.000Z	coz_	shorttech	 since I am falling short of an answer,, try ##linux channel ,, see if they have a suggestion/solution,, if you get it let me know
