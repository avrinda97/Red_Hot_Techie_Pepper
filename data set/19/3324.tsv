2009-10-27T02:48:00.000Z	m0ar		Transmission downloads in a maximum of 5-7KB/s, then drops.. Everything  works fine on windows etc, what may be wrong?
2009-10-27T02:49:00.000Z	mickster04	m0ar	could be internet seeders lan, router anythign?
2009-10-27T02:49:00.000Z	m0ar	mickster04	Seed is fine, my router should be fine
2009-10-27T02:50:00.000Z	m0ar	mickster04	works flawlessly in win7
2009-10-27T02:50:00.000Z	mickster04	m0ar	its frankly unlikely to be ubuntu,
2009-10-27T02:50:00.000Z	m0ar	mickster04	Some settings could surely screw things up
2009-10-27T02:50:00.000Z	mickster04	m0ar	well check limiting?
2009-10-27T02:51:00.000Z	m0ar	mickster04	Wich is?
2009-10-27T02:51:00.000Z	mickster04	m0ar	well edit>preferences
2009-10-27T02:51:00.000Z	m0ar	mickster04	Oh, that's fine
2009-10-27T02:51:00.000Z	mickster04	m0ar	then its very unlikely to be the OS, do u use a proxy
2009-10-27T02:52:00.000Z	m0ar	mickster04	Nope :)
2009-10-27T02:52:00.000Z	mickster04	m0ar	well i cant think of anything then
2009-10-27T02:52:00.000Z	m0ar	mickster04	Wierd...
2009-10-27T02:52:00.000Z	m0ar	mickster04	I haven't forwarded my linux ports
2009-10-27T02:52:00.000Z	m0ar	mickster04	Is it nothing more than forwarding them in the router, no screwing in ubuntu?
2009-10-27T02:53:00.000Z	mickster04	m0ar	i believe things like that would be either on or off...
2009-10-27T02:53:00.000Z	mickster04	m0ar	try it but i doubt it would have much effect, it would either connect or not#
2009-10-27T02:54:00.000Z	m0ar	mickster04	Well, some limitations
