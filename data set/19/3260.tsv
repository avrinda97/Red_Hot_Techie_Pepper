2009-09-21T03:11:00.000Z	mezy		Uhm..What does that command do?
2009-09-21T03:12:00.000Z	mezy		OH
2009-09-21T03:12:00.000Z	mezy		Nothing should up
2009-09-21T03:12:00.000Z	mezy		I just need to get into the hdd
2009-09-21T03:12:00.000Z	mezy		I have to move stuff out of it.
2009-09-21T03:12:00.000Z	mezy		ok
2009-09-21T03:13:00.000Z	mezy		Ok..
2009-09-21T03:13:00.000Z	mezy		Oh yeah
2009-09-21T03:13:00.000Z	mezy		I remember that command, eermm. I recognize it at least
2009-09-21T03:15:00.000Z	mezy		So, if I type fdisk -l /dev/sd, will it show me that specific part?
2009-09-21T03:15:00.000Z	Maritim	mezy	don't ask, try it
2009-09-21T03:08:00.000Z	Maritim	mezy	do you know which address your harddrive has been allocated?
2009-09-21T03:09:00.000Z	mezy	Maritim	Do you mean the /dev/sda thingies?
2009-09-21T03:09:00.000Z	Maritim	mezy	yes.
2009-09-21T03:09:00.000Z	Maritim	mezy	is it a scsi, sata or ide drive?
2009-09-21T03:10:00.000Z	Maritim	mezy	dmesg | grep /dev/sd
2009-09-21T03:11:00.000Z	Maritim	mezy	it shows the startup log and grabs anything with /dev/sd in it and prints it for your eyes to read
2009-09-21T03:12:00.000Z	Maritim	mezy	yeah, well, we need to figure out where your hdd is so that we can mount it
2009-09-21T03:12:00.000Z	Maritim	mezy	that is what we are trying to do. Just do dmesg and tell me if you see anything related to sda, sdb or anything like that
