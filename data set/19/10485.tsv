2006-12-07T15:22:00.000Z	dirge		Hello everyone.
2006-12-07T15:24:00.000Z	dirge		Anyone got a good recommendation on a uber-fast linux tutorial book? I don't like the ones that drag on.
2006-12-07T15:26:00.000Z	Arafangi1n	dirge	What language are they using?
2006-12-07T15:26:00.000Z	dirge	Arafangi1n	Well, everyone seems to like C++, but I'm messing around with Java just to be diffrent.
2006-12-07T15:27:00.000Z	dirge	Arafangi1n	I can do most any language.
2006-12-07T15:27:00.000Z	Arafangi1n	dirge	Are you joking?
2006-12-07T15:27:00.000Z	Arafangi1n	dirge	Usually people say quite the reverse :)
2006-12-07T15:27:00.000Z	dirge	Arafangi1n	No, I do realize Java works cross platforms, but I'd like to learn the Linux system so I can do C as well.
2006-12-07T15:28:00.000Z	dirge	Arafangi1n	Java is just so much easier. I spend 1-2 hours programming when the rest of the class takes days.
2006-12-07T15:28:00.000Z	Arafangi1n	dirge	Realise that Java _is_ a platform.
2006-12-07T15:28:00.000Z	Arafangi1n	dirge	They are probably taking days because they have yet to learn the STL.
2006-12-07T15:28:00.000Z	dirge	Arafangi1n	the VM is a platform, but the apps I make I'd like to specialize in Linux.
2006-12-07T15:28:00.000Z	Arafangi1n	dirge	I suggest you move away from Java then.
2006-12-07T15:29:00.000Z	dirge	Arafangi1n	I'm using Java because the class is talking about simple stuff I already understand. (Linked Lists, Hashtables, etc)
2006-12-07T15:29:00.000Z	Arafangi1n	dirge	Consider learning Python :)
2006-12-07T15:30:00.000Z	Arafangi1n	dirge	Those things are part of the core syntax.
2006-12-07T15:30:00.000Z	dirge	Arafangi1n	Yeah, taking all the core classes. Last class was Structures. The one I'm taking now is discrete structures. (No programming, all math.)
2006-12-07T15:31:00.000Z	Arafangi1n	dirge	python is nice for math too :)
2006-12-07T15:34:00.000Z	Arafangi1n	dirge	The opensource implementation of .NET
