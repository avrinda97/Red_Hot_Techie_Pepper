2009-12-22T02:11:00.000Z	lgc		I can't install Googleearth or Skype even with the Medibuntu repository enabled. Hint?
2009-12-22T02:12:00.000Z	lgc		!googleearth
2009-12-22T02:13:00.000Z	[Spooky]	lgc	Have you tried the static files for Skype?
2009-12-22T02:13:00.000Z	lgc	[Spooky]	how so?
2009-12-22T02:14:00.000Z	[Spooky]	lgc	I use them without any troubles...
2009-12-22T02:18:00.000Z	lgc	[Spooky]	I wonder why they don't seem to appear on the list.
2009-12-22T02:19:00.000Z	lgc	[Spooky]	how did you install Skype?
2009-12-22T02:20:00.000Z	[Spooky]	lgc	Wait a second...
2009-12-22T02:21:00.000Z	[Spooky]	lgc	Try: http://www.skype.com/go/getskype-linux-beta-static
2009-12-22T02:22:00.000Z	lgc	[Spooky]	so you went to the original sources and installed them in both cases?
2009-12-22T02:23:00.000Z	[Spooky]	lgc	Yes with skype i did... I dont use Google Earth...
2009-12-22T02:25:00.000Z	lgc	[Spooky]	with the static version you don't need skytools, python-skype or skysentials (the only skype entries on the repo), I gather.
2009-12-22T02:26:00.000Z	[Spooky]	lgc	You just use the static package...
2009-12-22T02:27:00.000Z	lgc	[Spooky]	the package you pointed to is a .tar.bz2 one. Will extracting do the trick?
2009-12-22T02:28:00.000Z	[Spooky]	lgc	Yes... You are a beginner with Ubuntu?
2009-12-22T02:29:00.000Z	lgc	[Spooky]	no, actually. But I don't want it installed in the Chromium download directory. I wonder why it's no .deb.
2009-12-22T02:30:00.000Z	[Spooky]	lgc	This is no installer... Its just packed ready for you to use...
2009-12-22T02:32:00.000Z	lgc	[Spooky]	hmmm...so it won't give me a menu entry and it won't install it its own cozy niche.
2009-12-22T02:35:00.000Z	[Spooky]	lgc	Nope..
