2006-06-11T08:53:00.000Z	LjL		"rm -rf ~/.gnome*" is probably not something that should be adviced lightly
2006-06-11T08:54:00.000Z	nanenj	LjL	should I say oops?  There's really no settings I had -anywhere- that were that big. :)  If all else fails, I can delete nanenj and recreate my account :P  so... didn't seem that big :P
2006-06-11T08:54:00.000Z	nanenj		but, unfortunately, it didn't work
2006-06-11T08:55:00.000Z	nanenj		the panel is still blank (first try I attempted copying the gconf etc from another user.)
2006-06-11T08:55:00.000Z	nanenj		and the panel showed up blank.  Can't seem to get it to change :(  does it require a full reboot and not just a restart of gnome to get it to read that?
2006-06-11T08:56:00.000Z	LjL	nanenj	if that's ok for you, then fine. it's just that you might not even had known what that command would have done, and you might have fallen under the impression that it simpyl reset the panel's configuration -- while, clearly, it can do a bit more than just that
2006-06-11T08:56:00.000Z	nanenj	LjL	:) -nods- I see :) I did figure it would ice all customizations, it just seems it hasn't even done that. :P so I'm left a little lost :P
2006-06-11T08:56:00.000Z	LjL	nanenj	doesn't surprise me that removing the gnome config dirs would blank the panel...
2006-06-11T08:57:00.000Z	LjL	nanenj	perhaps you *could* indeed recreate the user at this point, if you don't have any specific things you need to keep
2006-06-11T08:57:00.000Z	LjL		!javadebs
2006-06-11T08:57:00.000Z	nanenj		It didn't blank them, just the top one (which I accidentally deleted) shows up now, but is blank
2006-06-11T08:57:00.000Z	nanenj		the bottom one is indeed still default.
2006-06-11T08:57:00.000Z	nanenj		So -ponder-
2006-06-11T08:58:00.000Z	nanenj		I'd imagine the settings have to be -somewhere- I just don't know how to get them back... is there maybe a script that initializes new users?
2006-06-11T08:58:00.000Z	nanenj		Maybe I could run that on my existing account to get it to reset the account back to normal?
2006-06-11T08:58:00.000Z	LjL	nanenj	when a new user is created, the home dir is taken from /etc/skel. not sure if there's anything else being created after that
2006-06-11T08:59:00.000Z	nanenj	LjL	thanks, I'll look there :)
2006-06-11T08:59:00.000Z	LjL	nanenj	but /etc/skel doesn't really seem to contain anything gnome-related, just basic config files for the shell
2006-06-11T09:00:00.000Z	nanenj	LjL	Yeah, i just looked :)  so... let's see... maybe find out where gnome gets it's default settings from...
