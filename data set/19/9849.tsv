2007-04-08T08:37:00.000Z	worm		what is wrong?
2007-04-08T08:38:00.000Z	LordTureis	worm	what are you using to format it?
2007-04-08T08:38:00.000Z	worm		mkfs.vfat /dev/sda
2007-04-08T08:38:00.000Z	worm	LordTureis	i am using mkfs.vfat /dev/sda
2007-04-08T08:39:00.000Z	worm		and it returns this  Will not try to make filesystem on full-disk device
2007-04-08T08:39:00.000Z	LordTureis	worm	hmm, well I don't have much experience with mkfs, so I'm not sure I can help you
2007-04-08T08:40:00.000Z	worm	LordTureis	i already formated it, and all the funciotns are working fine except that when i ask to play teh music it reboots
2007-04-08T08:40:00.000Z	worm	LordTureis	should i change the filesystem?
2007-04-08T08:41:00.000Z	worm		apt-get install gcc
2007-04-08T08:41:00.000Z	worm		yeah i am wrong
2007-04-08T08:41:00.000Z	worm		sorry
2007-04-08T08:42:00.000Z	LordTureis	worm	I wouldn't, fat fs is virtually entirely cross-platform, which is the strength of usb devices.   What do you mean by 'reboot'?  does Ubuntu crash or does the usb drive?
2007-04-08T08:43:00.000Z	worm	LordTureis	the usb drive is also an mp3 player and it reboots the usb device i can read the files and listen to then through the computer, but cant listen out of it because it restarts the device
2007-04-08T08:43:00.000Z	worm		is there anything corruptefd or something?
2007-04-08T08:44:00.000Z	LordTureis	worm	what kind of usb drive/mp3 player do you have?
2007-04-08T08:45:00.000Z	worm		ALordTureis a SONY
2007-04-08T08:46:00.000Z	LordTureis	worm	was it working fine before you formatted it?
