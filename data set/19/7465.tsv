2010-06-23T05:21:00.000Z	Random832	ubutom	who says it's automatically illegal for anyone other than the owner to open the contents
2010-06-23T05:22:00.000Z	ubutom	Random832	yeah, very likely
2010-06-23T05:23:00.000Z	Random832	ubutom	or what if he is the legal guardian of the person who made the file
2010-06-23T05:23:00.000Z	ubutom	Random832	so what, is a legal guardian per default the owner of files that aren't his?
2010-06-23T05:25:00.000Z	Random832	ubutom	well _someone's_ not a parent
2010-06-23T05:25:00.000Z	ubutom	Random832	sure don't wanna be your kid then
2010-06-23T05:25:00.000Z	Random832	ubutom	you can't think of any legitimate need for a parent to be aware of the files their children are handling?
2010-06-23T05:26:00.000Z	ubutom	Random832	even children have rights and you don't protect them by digging your nose in everything they do
2010-06-23T05:26:00.000Z	ubutom	Random832	there is a thing called trust
2010-06-23T05:27:00.000Z	Random832	ubutom	there is also something called internet pseudo-libertarianism
2010-06-23T05:27:00.000Z	Random832	ubutom	my point stands that whatever you may think of it, it's not ILLEGAL
2010-06-23T05:27:00.000Z	ubutom	Random832	if anyone would monitor you as you are or will be monitoring your children, what would that be to you, illegal?
2010-06-23T05:28:00.000Z	ubutom	Random832	I did not say it was illegal, but I said they don't automatically become the owner!
2010-06-23T05:28:00.000Z	Random832	ubutom	yes you did, since i didn't say they _were_ the owner
2010-06-23T05:29:00.000Z	ubutom	Random832	no, I didn't, but suit yourself.
2010-06-23T05:31:00.000Z	ubutom	Random832	I said it's most likely illegal if you are not the owner of a file and you brought up the parents or legal guardian stuff by yourself as an excuse to undermine the rights of the legit owner of a file, period.
2010-06-23T05:32:00.000Z	Random832	ubutom	the law doesn't even HAVE a concept of ownership of computer files, independently of both the copyright of the file and the ownership of the media they are on
2010-06-23T05:32:00.000Z	ubutom	Random832	maybe your law
2010-06-23T05:32:00.000Z	ubutom	Random832	Big Brother is greeting
