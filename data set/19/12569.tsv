2005-08-11T12:49:00.000Z	juanej		but it is not
2005-08-11T12:51:00.000Z	Madpilot	juanej	mplayer is in Ubuntu's repos. search Synaptic for "mplay"
2005-08-11T12:51:00.000Z	Madpilot	juanej	see ubotu's post just above ^^^
2005-08-11T12:51:00.000Z	Madpilot	juanej	you might not have all the repos enabled - they aren't by default
2005-08-11T12:56:00.000Z	Madpilot	juanej	search in Synaptic - remember it uses the same database as apt-get does
2005-09-10T15:48:00.000Z	Madpilot	juanej	I've got one, not plugged in currently, but other ppl have gotten it working in Ubuntu. what model do you have?
2005-09-10T15:49:00.000Z	juanej	Madpilot	scanjet 3200c
2005-09-10T15:50:00.000Z	Madpilot	juanej	ask google, there are pretty good SANE pages out there
2005-09-10T15:51:00.000Z	juanej	Madpilot	ive been searching like 1 hour
2005-09-10T15:52:00.000Z	Madpilot	juanej	google on your device name plus "linux" or maybe "ubuntu"
2005-09-10T15:53:00.000Z	juanej	Madpilot	i already find it, installed the library but now i dont now how to install xsane or something to prove if the scanner is working
2005-09-10T15:54:00.000Z	Madpilot	juanej	xsane is in Ubuntu repos - search Synaptic
