2005-11-22T08:27:00.000Z	StDellis		Is there anyway to make my computer a wireless access point so me and some guys can play risk2. We are at university residence so we cant play through the network they have set up here?
2005-11-22T08:27:00.000Z	cafuego	StDellis	if you flip the cards into ad-hoc mode you should be fine.
2005-11-22T08:27:00.000Z	StDellis	cafuego	how would I do that
2005-11-22T08:27:00.000Z	cafuego	StDellis	via 'iwconfig'.
2005-11-22T08:29:00.000Z	StDellis	cafuego	ok how would I do that under windows for the other guys though
2005-11-22T08:32:00.000Z	StDellis	cafuego	if I turn it into ad-hoc mode do I hhave to turn it back to normal to be able to get on the internet?
2005-11-22T08:32:00.000Z	cafuego	StDellis	yep
2005-11-22T08:32:00.000Z	StDellis	cafuego	wuts the command to turn it back
2005-11-22T08:32:00.000Z	cafuego	StDellis	ifdown ethX; ifup ethX
2005-11-22T08:33:00.000Z	StDellis	cafuego	ok well is there anyway I can have my laptop as a wireless access point kinda?
2005-11-22T08:33:00.000Z	cafuego	StDellis	yes, like I said, if you run in ad-hoc mode you can all connect to eachother.
2005-11-22T08:33:00.000Z	StDellis	cafuego	ohh so only I have to be in that mode? not everyone else?
2005-11-22T08:33:00.000Z	cafuego	StDellis	There is another way, with special drivers (which may not work depending on what hardware you have) which is far more convoluted.
2005-11-22T08:33:00.000Z	cafuego	StDellis	No, everyone does.
2005-11-22T08:34:00.000Z	StDellis	cafuego	ok well is there a way to do this under windows?
2005-11-22T08:34:00.000Z	StDellis	cafuego	the ad-hoc mode way
2005-11-22T08:34:00.000Z	cafuego	StDellis	Ad hoc mode? yes. Just tell it to use computer-to-computer networks.
2005-11-22T08:34:00.000Z	cafuego	StDellis	(which is what ad-hoc is)
2005-11-22T08:34:00.000Z	StDellis	cafuego	ok thanks
