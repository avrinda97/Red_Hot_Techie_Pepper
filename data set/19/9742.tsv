2009-07-21T19:25:00.000Z	erUSUL	new2linx	try with « mplayer -ao esd mediafile »
2009-07-21T19:31:00.000Z	new2linx	erUSUL	nope, in fact the video doesn't even play. it just sits in one spot. here's the output. http://pastebin.com/f67018885
2009-07-21T19:32:00.000Z	erUSUL	new2linx	happens with all the files you tried ?
2009-07-21T19:32:00.000Z	new2linx	erUSUL	i have sound in VLC but not mplayer or totem? i do have sound in amarok 1.4. i am using 1.4 because I couldn't figure out how to get Amarok 2.1 to use mysql.
2009-07-21T19:32:00.000Z	new2linx	erUSUL	let me check
2009-07-21T19:33:00.000Z	erUSUL	new2linx	you have to configure all apps to use pulseaudio or esd or alsa depending on what they have aviable
2009-07-21T19:33:00.000Z	erUSUL	new2linx	totem you have to configure via gstreamer-properties
2009-07-21T19:34:00.000Z	new2linx	erUSUL	yes, it happens with a vob file also in mplayer. mplayer just sits there. does not play the video or tyhe audio. http://pastebin.com/f1b775174

2009-07-21T19:35:00.000Z	new2linx	erUSUL	here's a dialog box that appears also after I try to open a video file in mplayer. http://img406.imageshack.us/my.php?image=screenshot9j.png
2009-07-21T19:36:00.000Z	new2linx	erUSUL	well, when I start a movie by right clicking on it in nautilus and select open with mplayer the movie plays fine but just no audio. when I start it from the cl your way, it doesn't play at all.
2009-07-21T19:38:00.000Z	erUSUL	new2linx	try editting the config http://paste.ubuntu.com/223606/
2009-07-21T19:39:00.000Z	new2linx	erUSUL	well, i now have sound in totem somehow. but not in mplayer. i get a dialog box like this:  http://img33.imageshack.us/my.php?image=screenshot10m.png (but that's when I right click on it and say open with mplayer.)
2009-07-21T19:41:00.000Z	new2linx	erUSUL	after editing my users mplayer config to look like yours. i still get the audio error popup dialog box
2009-07-21T19:43:00.000Z	erUSUL	new2linx	then i dunno... try with alsa instead of pulse
2009-07-21T19:44:00.000Z	erUSUL	new2linx	weird indeed; no thoughts
2009-07-21T19:47:00.000Z	new2linx	erUSUL	do you know what commands control nautilus right click menu? because now vlc won't even open when I chose "open with vlc"
2009-07-21T19:48:00.000Z	erUSUL	new2linx	dunno sorry... maybe you should restart the session... or nautilus
