2005-08-02T13:35:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	drew	 if you log in as root you can access ad ministrative functions; but as a normal user, ubuntu supplies sudoing function to give 'administrator' users the ability to run programs as root by entering their password at the appropriate time.
2005-08-02T13:36:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	drew	 Root access precludes any security.
2005-08-02T13:36:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	drew	 If someone gets you and you have root, your box is screwed.
2005-08-02T13:36:00.000Z	drew	bluefoxicy	what do you mean?
2005-08-02T13:37:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	drew	 If I were to gain access to you through illicit means (re:  http://www.thinkgeek.com/books/nonfiction/6637/ ) I could sit around and kill some of your programs.
2005-08-02T13:38:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	drew	 I could break your files and shit too.  Maybe access a terminal, sniff your X session.  A few countermeasures to handle hacking your X session up could handle that though (SE-X)
2005-08-02T13:39:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	drew	 Now if you were root, I could jack in and stick a kernel module in your kernel, autoload it in your init scripts, and have it hide the init files that autoload it so you don't see it ever.
2005-08-02T13:39:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	drew	 Then I could start sniffing memory and networks for passwords, encryption keys, and credit card IDs.  Boom.
2005-08-02T13:39:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	drew	 So?  I can break into your PC through GAIM or X-chat or Firefox given a bit of advanced knowledge, if I can catch it before pitti finds out.
2005-08-02T13:40:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	drew	  You wouldn't know if I did it.
2005-08-02T13:41:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	drew	 With a kernel module, I could make ls and stat() not show files.
2005-08-02T13:41:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	drew	 This could be used to hide the files placed in your init scripts so that at boot time the hacked up kerenl module is silently modprobe()d for.  The module would hide itself from lsmod too.  Its file would be hidden too.
2005-08-02T13:42:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	drew	 so one day your browser or gaim crashes, you're root, no big deal.  What you don't know is that someone is now reading everything you do on the net, everything in memory, and can pick up your credit card IDs, passwords to bank accounts, etc.
2005-08-02T13:42:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	drew	 and at every reboot, the hijacked environment is set back up silently.  You never get a chance to find out about it.
2005-08-02T13:43:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	drew	 Use root to do admin tasks only.  Ubuntu provides sudo for that so you use root the least amount you have to.
2005-08-02T13:44:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	drew	 if you log in one ady and get rooted, then become a normal user, you're permenantly taken.
2005-08-02T13:44:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	drew	 gnome, system->administration, there's all you need root for.  It asks for your password, just enter it and bam.  Program gets root.
2005-08-02T13:46:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	drew	 firestarter/iptables is useless typically on ubuntu :)
