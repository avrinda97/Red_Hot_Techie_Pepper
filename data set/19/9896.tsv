2009-01-17T03:13:00.000Z	filthpig	Necrosan	ask your entire problem/question in one line. That makes it a lot easier for all of us to help you.
2009-01-17T03:15:00.000Z	filthpig	Necrosan	what part of "ONE LINE" don't you understand? With all the activity here it's very confusing and annoying to try to follow you when you use enter as punctuation
2009-01-17T03:15:00.000Z	Necrosan	filthpig	Can't you just temporarily ignore everyone but me?
2009-01-17T03:16:00.000Z	filthpig	Necrosan	no. Your problem is not more important than anybody elses.
2009-01-17T03:16:00.000Z	Necrosan	filthpig	How can you say that seriously?
2009-01-17T03:19:00.000Z	filthpig	Necrosan	If you would kindly state all your previous actions, choices and results, along with current status in ONE LINE/POST, it will be better for us to help you. We're not glued to this channel and we do have lives outside the computer, so if your problem really is that important to you, please do as I say, because that will increase you chance of a good, helping answer a LOT
2009-01-17T03:22:00.000Z	filthpig	Necrosan	what system are you on right now? A nice app called unetbootin will download and extract ubuntu (or any other Linux OS) on a usb stick for you. I think that's the way to go when you don't have a cdrom. I'm actually using unetbootin right now
2009-01-17T03:23:00.000Z	Necrosan	filthpig	OSX 10.5
2009-01-17T03:28:00.000Z	Necrosan	filthpig	I don't know if you are familir with sparc64, but I can boot a different disk just by typing "boot disk1" (for disk 2, disk 1 is disk0)
2009-01-17T03:25:00.000Z	filthpig	Necrosan	ah, unetbootin only exists for windows and linux currently :(
2009-01-17T03:26:00.000Z	Necrosan	filthpig	I can't just dd it over to the disk?
2009-01-17T03:27:00.000Z	filthpig	Necrosan	you need to make it bootable. There might be other ways to do that, but I don't know how
2009-01-17T03:30:00.000Z	filthpig	Necrosan	I've never even seen a sparc computer afaik ;) if you know that you can boot an iso image off an usb stick with sparc64, feel free to try. I have no knowledge of it, but please report back with your findings :)
