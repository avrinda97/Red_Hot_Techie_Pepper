2011-10-08T21:11:00.000Z	iwaka_		I installed Ubuntu but did not partition the drive. Should I partition it, and if so, how should I do it? I'm NOT using dual-boot, just Ubuntu.
2011-10-08T21:11:00.000Z	edbian	iwaka_	It is impossible to install ubuntu without at least creating an ext4 partition so unless you already had one you 're-partitioned'
2011-10-08T21:12:00.000Z	iwaka_	edbian	what would 're-partitioning' mean in that case?
2011-10-08T21:13:00.000Z	edbian	iwaka_	If you install ubuntu and you don't have a ext4 partition you must create one.  This usually means shrinking other partitions.  That would be 'repartitioning'
2011-10-08T21:15:00.000Z	iwaka_	edbian	I somehow managed to install ubuntu while at the same time completely avoiding anything that involves partitioning. Unless the installer partitioned the drive for me automatically, I believe I'm still sitting with and unpartitioned drive. But then again, I'm clearly missing something.
2011-10-08T21:15:00.000Z	edbian	iwaka_	Did you install using wubi?   Did you start the install while running windows?
2011-10-08T21:15:00.000Z	edbian	iwaka_	In that case the drive is not partitioned
2011-10-08T21:16:00.000Z	iwaka_	edbian	I installed from a USB drive, replacing Windows completely.
2011-10-08T21:17:00.000Z	edbian	iwaka_	Then you re-partitioned  (especially if windows is gone, that means you must have deleted those partitions!)
2011-10-08T21:19:00.000Z	edbian	iwaka_	don't do that, use this: paste.ubuntu.com
2011-10-08T21:19:00.000Z	iwaka_	edbian	I'm sorry, will do that.
2011-10-08T21:19:00.000Z	edbian	iwaka_	I don't speak Chinese so it's hard to tell
2011-10-08T21:20:00.000Z	iwaka_	edbian	the Chinese in the 2nd row says 'extended'
2011-10-08T21:20:00.000Z	iwaka_	edbian	I believe the one before Solaris is 'swap'
2011-10-08T21:21:00.000Z	edbian	iwaka_	There are no windows partitions on that drive.  You must have 're-partitioned' them away :)
2011-10-08T21:21:00.000Z	iwaka_	edbian	well, in that case, i believe Ubuntu did the work for me :)
2011-10-08T21:22:00.000Z	edbian	iwaka_	It's possible.  It does give some simple high level partitioning choices such as 'replace windows' and 'install alongside windows'
2011-10-08T21:22:00.000Z	iwaka_	edbian	I chose 'replace' :)
2011-10-08T21:22:00.000Z	edbian	iwaka_	then it repartitioned (cause you told it to)
