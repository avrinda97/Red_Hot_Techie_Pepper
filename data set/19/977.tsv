2011-06-29T09:04:00.000Z	Erik500002		hey guys need some help I accidentally deleted my wireless modules so I have no wifi, how can I restore everything back to default
2011-06-29T09:06:00.000Z	dtchen	Erik500002	did the wireless modules come with Ubuntu, i.e., were they part of linux-image?
2011-06-29T09:06:00.000Z	dtchen	Erik500002	^ what DanaG implied
2011-06-29T09:43:00.000Z	dtchen	Erik500002	that normally means something's syntactically amiss in /etc/modprobe.d/*.conf
2011-06-29T09:43:00.000Z	dtchen	Erik500002	dmesg can shed some light
2011-06-29T09:45:00.000Z	Erik500002	dtchen	dmesg shows unknown symbol wiphy_free (err -22) and another one with disagrees about versino of symbol wiphy_new
