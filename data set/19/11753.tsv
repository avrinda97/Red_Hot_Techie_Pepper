2006-11-07T17:35:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	aaron_	you can use any folder you want, as long as its empty
2006-11-07T17:39:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	aaron_	linux doesnt use letters for drive designation
2006-11-07T17:39:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	aaron_	you drive will be /dev/hda1 for primary pata master partition1, /dev/hdb1 for secondary master partition1, and so on
2006-11-07T17:40:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	aaron_	sdb would be secondary scsi/sata drive :)
2006-11-07T17:43:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	aaron_	do you own the mount folder?
2006-11-07T17:45:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	aaron_	to make yourself the owner of a directory or file, type sudo chown <username>:<username> /<path>
2006-11-07T17:46:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	aaron_	to make that user the owner of all files and folders under that path, use -R
