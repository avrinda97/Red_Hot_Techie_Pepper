2010-04-11T21:55:00.000Z	mothdragon		does anyone know how to reinstall the ubuntu-desktop without an internet connection?
2010-04-11T21:56:00.000Z	mothdragon		yes i do
2010-04-11T21:57:00.000Z	mothdragon		i don't have a gui at all. I only have command line. And I'm unfamiliar with command line
2010-04-11T21:59:00.000Z	mothdragon		thanks coz_
2010-04-11T22:00:00.000Z	mothdragon		can anyone tell me how to find a particular file from command line, regardless of what directory it is in?
2010-04-11T22:01:00.000Z	ChogyDan	mothdragon	maybe find . | grep file_name
2010-04-11T22:02:00.000Z	mothdragon	ChogyDan	thanks... but both of those don't seem to work... grep just seems to suspend me, and find doesn't seem to probe subdirectories
2010-04-11T22:02:00.000Z	ChogyDan	mothdragon	grep suspends you?
2010-04-11T22:03:00.000Z	mothdragon	ChogyDan	well when i type grep *.ko from the / directory then it just drops the cursor to the next line and doesn't seem to do anything else...
2010-04-11T22:04:00.000Z	ChogyDan	mothdragon	that's why you need to do find.  See, *s are interpreted by bash, not grep
2010-04-11T22:05:00.000Z	ChogyDan	mothdragon	find / | grep .ko
2010-04-11T22:06:00.000Z	mothdragon	ChogyDan	i've tried the same thing with find... find *.ko and it reports instantly that there is no such file... when i try searching for something that i know is in a subdirectory (such as bin/sh) from the / directory, it still tells me no such file...
2010-04-11T22:07:00.000Z	mothdragon	ChogyDan	.ko is the right extension for a module right? ie 8712.ko?
2010-04-11T22:11:00.000Z	ChogyDan	mothdragon	find / | grep "\.ko$"
2010-04-11T22:12:00.000Z	mothdragon	ChogyDan	so literally type: find / | grep "\.ko$"
2010-04-11T22:13:00.000Z	mothdragon	ChogyDan	thanks :) I
2010-04-11T22:13:00.000Z	ChogyDan	mothdragon	that was from erUSUL  :)
2010-04-11T22:17:00.000Z	mothdragon	ChogyDan	thanks for the help... unfortunately it seems that since i am running in "safe mode" the module i need, doesn't seem to be present... is there a way for me to download the ubuntu-desktop package onto a thumbdrive and then use that to install the desktop on the other computer?
2010-04-11T22:18:00.000Z	ChogyDan	mothdragon	I don't know.  Maybe you could just install the alternate cd to the usb
