2010-03-18T04:28:00.000Z	Zehrila-		Hello everyone. My ubuntu installation went just fine but whenever the system boots into GUI, the screen goes black with the backlight on and nothing on display. The same thing happened before when I tried booting Ubuntu from the LiveCD so I had to do an installation from the text-based alternative CD
2010-03-18T04:28:00.000Z	Zehrila-		Is there any way to get the GUI to work?
2010-03-18T04:28:00.000Z	Zehrila-		it is working actually, as I can even hear the startup sound - just nothing displays on the screen.
2010-03-18T04:29:00.000Z	Typos_King	Zehrila-	     do you get a Grub menu at boot?
2010-03-18T04:29:00.000Z	Zehrila-	Typos_King	Yes, I do.
2010-03-18T04:31:00.000Z	Typos_King	Zehrila-	     once at the menu, select your ubuntu entry to boot with, press 'e' to edit the line, scroll down to the line that has the  /boot/vmlinuz.....   go to the end of it, and add -> acpi=off noapic; press Ctrl-x to boot from line
2010-03-18T04:31:00.000Z	Zehrila-	Typos_King	Do I include the semi-colon after noapic?
2010-03-18T04:33:00.000Z	Typos_King	Zehrila-	     no :)  just acpi=off noapic
2010-03-18T04:34:00.000Z	Typos_King	Zehrila-	     that's to bypass the acpi module, which causes issues, usually a blank screen at boot
2010-03-18T04:35:00.000Z	Zehrila-	Typos_King	it didnt work
2010-03-18T04:36:00.000Z	Typos_King	Zehrila-	     I assume you didn't press ctrl-x to boot from line?   rather than pressing enter which changes nothing and uses whatever WAS there
2010-03-18T04:36:00.000Z	Zehrila-	Typos_King	I did press ctrl+x and it did go through the booting sequence
2010-03-18T04:37:00.000Z	Zehrila-		but after those several lines scrolled past really fast, when it came time for the GUI to load, I got a back-lit black screen
2010-03-18T04:37:00.000Z	Zehrila-		something like a gray textured wallpaper did appear for a split second
2010-03-18T04:37:00.000Z	Zehrila-		before the screen turned black
2010-03-18T04:37:00.000Z	Typos_King	Zehrila-	     you pressed ctrl-x right after typing in those arguments?
2010-03-18T04:37:00.000Z	Zehrila-	Typos_King	yup, so I did
2010-03-18T04:37:00.000Z	Typos_King	Zehrila-	     now we know is not that then :)
2010-03-18T04:38:00.000Z	Typos_King	Zehrila-	     what about the 'safe mode' option?   does it work?
