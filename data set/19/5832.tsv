2008-05-07T01:06:00.000Z	gronne		Are there any other differences between kubuntu and ubuntu than one using KDE and one GNOME?
2008-05-07T01:07:00.000Z	gronne		Ok, because my friend told me KDE was "far better" than GNOME... should I care about that statement?
2008-05-07T01:08:00.000Z	gronne		Yeah, he claimed it was faster and all too, but I just thought I'll ask you guys instead.. Credibility, you know =)
2008-05-07T01:08:00.000Z	jrib	gronne	you should try both and use the one you like to use more
2008-05-07T01:09:00.000Z	gronne	jrib	Yeah I probably should. But I'm quite happy with Ubuntu
2008-05-07T01:10:00.000Z	jrib	gronne	you can install both and choose which to use when you login
2008-06-02T22:34:00.000Z	jrib	gronne	you should be installing software through APT
2008-06-02T22:45:00.000Z	jrib	gronne	yes, see the second link ubottu gave you about compiling
2008-06-02T22:47:00.000Z	jrib	gronne	the INSTALL and/or README files should tell you the libraries you need.  The error ./configure gave you should suggest it as well.  Once you figure out you need, you install the -dev package for the library
2008-06-02T22:48:00.000Z	gronne	jrib	Yeah, I guess the error in the confige should say it aswell, but I've been reading alot now, and I don't see what the specific problem is... Can't i post it?
2008-06-02T22:49:00.000Z	jrib	gronne	sure, put it up on paste.ubuntu.com
2008-06-02T22:50:00.000Z	gronne	jrib	http://paste.ubuntu.com/16443/
2008-06-02T22:50:00.000Z	jrib	gronne	useless, you need to pastebin the README and INSTALL files too
2008-06-02T22:51:00.000Z	gronne	jrib	ok.. I read them earlier and I think they may be useful.. wait
2008-06-02T22:53:00.000Z	gronne	jrib	http://paste.ubuntu.com/16444/  I copy and pasted the install and readme-files in there too
2008-06-02T23:03:00.000Z	gronne	jrib	did you see the paste? http://paste.ubuntu.com/16444/
2008-06-02T23:04:00.000Z	jrib	gronne	I missed it, thanks
2008-06-02T23:05:00.000Z	jrib	gronne	the stuff in the readme (like ftdi_sio), is that taken care of?
2008-06-02T23:07:00.000Z	gronne	jrib	I don't know how I possible could've missed that line... because I've read both of them... is it on synaptic.. well I'll try
