2009-10-22T15:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lin20	ive seen no question
2009-10-22T15:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lin20	check your /etc/fstab is correct
2009-10-22T15:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lin20	run: sudo fdisk -l    look at the partitions and types
2009-10-22T15:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lin20	then run: sudo blkid     to get the IDs
2009-10-22T15:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lin20	then read fstab to make sure its all singing right
2009-10-22T15:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lin20	thats normal
2009-10-22T15:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lin20	just check the partitions on each disk and how the system is laid out
2009-10-22T15:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lin20	fstab uses usids now so you will need to make a note of the blkids you read and which partition they relate to and what file system it uses
2009-10-22T16:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Lin20	its located in /boot/grub/menu.lst
