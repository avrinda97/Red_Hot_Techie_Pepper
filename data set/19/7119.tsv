2007-10-07T09:08:00.000Z	meuradio		I'm on an emergency shell, I need help mounting a scsi external usb drive
2007-10-07T09:09:00.000Z	Pelo	meuradio	  sudo mount /dev/whatever /mountpoint
2007-10-07T09:10:00.000Z	meuradio	Pelo	do I have to create the mountpoint before? when I tried "mount sdb" the reply I got was "can't find sbd in fstab of mtab"
2007-10-07T09:10:00.000Z	Pelo	meuradio	  you need to mount a specific partition  (sdb1)  , and yes you need to creat a mount point   sudo mkdir /media/usb    for exemple
2007-10-07T09:11:00.000Z	Pelo	meuradio	what is the FS of that usb drive ? ntfs will cause you problems you won'T be able to write to it
2007-10-07T09:12:00.000Z	meuradio	Pelo	I know, it took me 2 days to manage to format it to fat32
2007-10-07T09:12:00.000Z	Pelo	meuradio	  sudo mount -f vfat /dev/sdb1 /media/usb
2007-10-07T09:15:00.000Z	meuradio	Pelo	"cannot create directory /media/usb: read-only file system"
2007-10-07T09:16:00.000Z	Pelo	meuradio	 sudo mkdir ....
2007-10-07T09:17:00.000Z	meuradio	Pelo	"bash: sudo: command not found
2007-10-07T09:17:00.000Z	Pelo	meuradio	 that makes very little sense,  what are you running atm,  the ubuntu recovery mode , from your install ?
2007-10-07T09:18:00.000Z	Pelo	meuradio	I'm lost then
2007-10-07T09:19:00.000Z	Pelo	meuradio	I don't mean taht I don'T know the kubuntu dcommand but   sudo should work on any linux box anyway
2007-10-07T09:20:00.000Z	Pelo	meuradio	 I think you need to recover your hdd before you can mount to it ,  not sure how you do that ,  run fsck maybe
2007-10-07T09:20:00.000Z	meuradio	Pelo	being in the recovery shell I am listed as root@dell-laptop, therefore I shouldn't need sudo as I am alerady root
2007-10-07T09:20:00.000Z	meuradio	Pelo	fsck hangs with error 8, saying that maybe the disk is a zerolenght partition (which is obviously not)
2007-10-07T09:20:00.000Z	Pelo	meuradio	  yeah , you are correct,  no sudo , but then that means you need to fix your hdd before proceeding,  try with the llive cd
2007-10-07T09:21:00.000Z	meuradio	Pelo	I didn't seem to be able to find the local disk from the live cd
2007-10-07T09:22:00.000Z	Pelo	meuradio	I think I understand the prob but it's over my head, sorry , maybe the ppl in ##linux can help
