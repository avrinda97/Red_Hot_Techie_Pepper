2007-12-25T21:04:00.000Z	mc2		but ymmv
2007-12-25T21:04:00.000Z	Andeh	mc2	My memory seems fine.
2007-12-25T20:43:00.000Z	mc2	Andeh	sudo su
2007-12-25T20:43:00.000Z	Andeh	mc2	Lol?
2007-12-25T20:44:00.000Z	mc2	Andeh	what are you trying to do anyway
2007-12-25T20:45:00.000Z	Andeh	mc2	Well, the whole thing is fuxored. HAL doesnt run at boot, I need to start in recovery mode and load GDM manually, and I have no internet
2007-12-25T20:46:00.000Z	mc2	Andeh	that's messed up. i think it'll be fixed faster if you reinstalled...
2007-12-25T20:47:00.000Z	Andeh	mc2	No, I just spent 2 hours installing
2007-12-25T20:47:00.000Z	Andeh	mc2	Not counting the other 8 hours
2007-12-25T20:50:00.000Z	mc2	Andeh	probably a result of either a messed up installation or a messed up installer. you probably should reinstall and if the problem reappears download a better iso(i recommend from the torrents)
2007-12-25T20:51:00.000Z	Andeh	mc2	I did download a better iso, the results were even worse.
2007-12-25T20:51:00.000Z	Andeh	mc2	This install from a shipit CD
2007-12-25T20:52:00.000Z	mc2	Andeh	have you tried putting in a different OS? maybe your drive or ram is corrupt.
2007-12-25T20:53:00.000Z	Andeh	mc2	Yeah, i tried installing Windows XP six times, each time it was a different error, it couldnt find this file, or no operatin system, or it exploded all the partitions.
2007-12-25T20:54:00.000Z	mc2	Andeh	(1)check your ram with the livecd ram check option (2)your drive is broke, you need to replace it.
2007-12-25T20:59:00.000Z	mc2	Andeh	depends on how fast your ram is and the type of tests.
2007-12-25T21:01:00.000Z	Andeh	mc2	So um, you reccomend I just reinstall it?
2007-12-25T21:02:00.000Z	mc2	Andeh	what soundray said. :)
2007-12-25T21:52:00.000Z	Andeh	mc2	I just reinstalled Ubuntu on my laptop.
