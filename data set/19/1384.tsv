2011-02-21T02:47:00.000Z	rafaa	ActionParsnip	please, repeat the answer
2011-02-21T02:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rafaa	you didn't answer the question
2011-02-21T02:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rafaa	what file system is the partition (you don't mount drives)
2011-02-21T02:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rafaa	what file system is the partition?
2011-02-21T02:45:00.000Z	rafaa	ActionParsnip	ntfs for the pendrives
2011-02-21T02:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rafaa	when you last took it out of a system, what steps did you take?
2011-02-21T02:47:00.000Z	rafaa	ActionParsnip	it's not a corrupted filesystem problem, I'm sure, because it happens with all of external drives... It's sort of a lock that stays smwhere
2011-02-21T02:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rafaa	when you removed the device from the last system, what steps did you take?
2011-02-21T02:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rafaa	is there a partition on it?
2011-02-21T02:51:00.000Z	rafaa	ActionParsnip	DasEi: lsof /dev/sr0 (the cdrom) shows smth interesting.. There's a program called gvfsd-cdd.. Seems the gnome virtual FS daemon. Why is it here?
2011-02-21T02:52:00.000Z	rafaa	ActionParsnip	a partition on what? on the SD card?
2011-02-21T02:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rafaa	yes, it's new so may not be partitioned
2011-02-21T02:56:00.000Z	rafaa	ActionParsnip	I am not sure, but Dolphin can browse it, so there must be a filesytem... right?
2011-02-21T02:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rafaa	indeed
2011-02-21T02:58:00.000Z	rafaa	ActionParsnip	now I have plugged a pendrive (ntfs) and nautilus popped up... WHY THE HELL??? The KDE notifier correctly opens Dolphin if I click "Open with file manager" but Nautilus popped out anyway, without asking permission..
2011-02-21T02:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rafaa	mixing DEs isn't 100% smooth dude
2011-02-21T02:59:00.000Z	rafaa	ActionParsnip	hmmm I see.. but I love Ubuntu.. and I love KDE :/ and I'm not very happy with Kubuntu.. anyway, there must be a way! C'mon!! it's 2011 :D
2011-02-21T03:01:00.000Z	rafaa	ActionParsnip	DasEi: if I try umounting thru Dolphin HAL says it can't because it didn't mount the volume itself...
