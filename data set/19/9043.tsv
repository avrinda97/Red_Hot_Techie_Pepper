2007-10-20T08:24:00.000Z	Oni-Dracula		I'm having a problem sharing folders to a windows machine using Samba... I would like to either set up a username/password for my windows box to log in with or completely disable the need to use a user/pass.  Unfortunately the use of "smbpasswd" yields an error resulting in no pass being created
2007-10-20T08:25:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Oni-Dracula	would solving the smbpasswd issue be the best solution?
2007-10-20T08:25:00.000Z	Oni-Dracula	IntuitiveNipple	if it's the shortest method of allowing my ubuntu shares to be accessed by my windows machine - yes
2007-10-20T08:26:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Oni-Dracula	I agree :) How are you running smbpasswd, and what is the error?
2007-10-20T08:26:00.000Z	Oni-Dracula	IntuitiveNipple	lol I think i just figured out - I'm not using sudo and I'm getting "Could not connect to machine 127.0.0.1: NT_STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE"
2007-10-20T08:26:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Oni-Dracula	oh duh :p
2007-10-20T08:27:00.000Z	Oni-Dracula	IntuitiveNipple	your nipple is truly intuitive
2007-10-20T08:27:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Oni-Dracula	:p
2007-10-20T08:40:00.000Z	Oni-Dracula	IntuitiveNipple	is "false" a valid option for "security = " in smb.conf ?
2007-10-20T08:40:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Oni-Dracula	I'm not entirely sure, it's a long time since I messed with that. You'd have to check the documents.
2007-10-20T08:41:00.000Z	Oni-Dracula	IntuitiveNipple	I'm still having problems with samba - it's not accepting the username/password I'm giving it in winderz
2007-10-20T08:41:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Oni-Dracula	check the local logs in /var/log/samba/ for clues
2007-10-20T08:43:00.000Z	Oni-Dracula	IntuitiveNipple	funny that... all the logs are empty :)
2007-10-20T08:43:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Oni-Dracula	Is the smbd server actually running? :p
2007-10-20T08:44:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Oni-Dracula	" ps -ef | grep smbd" should show a couple of processes at least
2007-10-20T08:46:00.000Z	Oni-Dracula	IntuitiveNipple	it's running... I think
2007-10-20T08:47:00.000Z	Oni-Dracula	IntuitiveNipple	I just shared a folder through nautilus and oddly enough it let me through... maybe doing so restarted the service?
2007-10-20T08:47:00.000Z	Oni-Dracula	IntuitiveNipple	nevermind, its still not working... I'm an idiot
2007-10-20T08:50:00.000Z	Oni-Dracula	IntuitiveNipple	you know it helps if you specify a username with smbpasswd :)
