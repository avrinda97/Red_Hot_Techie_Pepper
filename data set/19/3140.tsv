2009-10-19T03:49:00.000Z	dakham		hi people, in ubuntu jaunty i've installed amarok, but after the download of 61 packages, after the installation of some, no
2009-10-19T03:49:00.000Z	dakham		i ended the space in the device
2009-10-19T03:50:00.000Z	dakham		i removed manually the packeges in /var/cache/
2009-10-19T03:50:00.000Z	mgolisch	dakham	and?
2009-10-19T03:51:00.000Z	mgolisch	dakham	the other packages probably got installed allready
2009-10-19T03:51:00.000Z	dakham	mgolisch	how can i remove the packages of the firts partial amarok installation?
2009-10-19T03:52:00.000Z	dakham	mgolisch	i would remove all the 61 packages installed the first time
2009-10-19T03:52:00.000Z	dakham	mgolisch	i don't want any qt4/kde packages for any reason i my system now...
2009-10-19T03:52:00.000Z	mgolisch	dakham	uninstall them then,
2009-10-19T03:53:00.000Z	dakham	mgolisch	i don't know how in synaptic and in command line
2009-10-19T03:53:00.000Z	dakham	mgolisch	i haven't anything in the synaptic history
2009-10-19T03:54:00.000Z	dakham	mgolisch	i think because i removed manually all the content of /var/chache/apt/archives
2009-10-19T03:54:00.000Z	mgolisch	dakham	no i dont think synaptic does log anything like that or maybe becaue the install command failed
2009-10-19T03:55:00.000Z	mgolisch	dakham	you can look at amaroks depenencies and see if any of that is installed
2009-10-19T03:55:00.000Z	mgolisch	dakham	like apt-cache depends amarok or i think synpatics might show the dependant packages too
2009-10-19T03:55:00.000Z	dakham	mgolisch	i looked but now dependencies are less, and not installed
2009-10-19T03:56:00.000Z	dakham	mgolisch	i haven't any trace of what is installed of amarok in m system...
2009-10-19T03:58:00.000Z	mgolisch	dakham	the dependencies dont change, looking at the depenencies tab should allways look the same, unless synaptic somehow hides allready installed dependencies
2009-10-19T03:58:00.000Z	dakham	mgolisch	oh, now i look
