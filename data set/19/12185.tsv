2011-04-16T09:16:00.000Z	tor_		Have used FireFox Portable for a while..... So have all my stuff there.
2011-04-16T09:17:00.000Z	tor_		Is the program called Windows Flash?
2011-04-16T09:18:00.000Z	tor_		Can't find it.
2011-04-16T09:18:00.000Z	kbrosnan	tor_	Adobe Flash for Firefox (windows)
2011-04-16T09:18:00.000Z	kbrosnan	tor_	get it from adobe
2011-04-16T09:18:00.000Z	kbrosnan		not the software center
2011-04-16T09:21:00.000Z	tor_		Ok
2011-04-16T09:25:00.000Z	tor_		<bob__> Tried to look for it, but couldn't find. Also searched for "flash".
2011-04-16T09:29:00.000Z	tor_		I think I'm pretty noob. Still looking for a Flash program to run in Wine/Firefox. The Adobe Flash I installed are stopping the prosess. (The prosess is freezing)
2011-04-16T09:31:00.000Z	kbrosnan	tor_	open Windows Firefox, go to adobe's website download flash, install flash
2011-04-16T09:31:00.000Z	tor_		I use Firefox for Wine because it is FireFox Portable, where I got all my old stuff. New to Ubuntu/Linux.
2011-04-16T09:33:00.000Z	tor_	kbrosnan	I installed flash from Adobe's website, but that made Firefox Portable unstable/freeze. Thinking about installing another Flash program.
2011-04-16T09:37:00.000Z	kbrosnan	tor_	then use Linux Firefox and Flash, it will likely work better
