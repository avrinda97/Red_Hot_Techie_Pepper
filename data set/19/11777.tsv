2006-08-31T07:07:00.000Z	bobbob1016		can anyone help me manually remove firestarter?  I did a kernal upgrade to get my battery to show up, and I didn't know to do iptables, and now firestarter is in a constant broken state, and it always says so when I do anything apt-get related

2006-08-31T07:08:00.000Z	sethk	bobbob1016	you can do that, but have you tried to repair the package data first?
2006-08-31T07:15:00.000Z	sethk	bobbob1016	what was you answer to my question about trying to repair the package data?
2006-08-31T07:16:00.000Z	sethk	bobbob1016	try running synaptic and selecting the repair option from the menu
2006-08-31T07:18:00.000Z	sethk	bobbob1016	can you paste the error you are getting to the 'paste bot?
2006-08-31T07:21:00.000Z	sethk	bobbob1016	if it's a one liner you can paste it here, or two lines
2006-08-31T07:21:00.000Z	sethk	bobbob1016	you did that, with sudo?  sudo dpkg --configure -a     ?
2006-08-31T07:22:00.000Z	sethk	bobbob1016	I'm just not convinced that uninstalling is going to make any difference
2006-08-31T07:22:00.000Z	sethk	bobbob1016	we have to find the root of the problem
2006-08-31T07:23:00.000Z	sethk	bobbob1016	sorry, I know you've told us twice, but run through it again for me, what you did that got you into this situation.
2006-08-31T07:23:00.000Z	sethk	bobbob1016	I thought you had asked about removing, sorry if that's wrong
2006-08-31T07:24:00.000Z	sethk	bobbob1016	why not add the iptables support?
2006-08-31T07:25:00.000Z	sethk	bobbob1016	do you need firestarter for some reason?
2006-08-31T07:26:00.000Z	sethk	bobbob1016	ok, give us the exact text of one of those errors
2006-08-31T07:31:00.000Z	sethk	bobbob1016	I'm not sure if you answered; what is the exact text of the error you get?
2006-08-31T07:31:00.000Z	sethk	bobbob1016	aptitude is another front end to apt-get, like synaptic.  irrelevant to this problem
2006-08-31T07:33:00.000Z	sethk	bobbob1016	try sudo rm /var/lib/dpkg/lock
2007-05-04T10:09:00.000Z	sethk	bobbob1016	that's some wall you've got there.
