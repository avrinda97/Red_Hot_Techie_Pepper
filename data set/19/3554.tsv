2009-08-04T22:20:00.000Z	arleslie		How can I get a list of PIDs running?
2009-08-04T22:20:00.000Z	Slart	arleslie	ps
2009-08-04T22:20:00.000Z	arleslie	Slart	dayo : thanks
2009-08-04T22:22:00.000Z	Slart	arleslie	ps -a will give you a long list of pids.. but since you're looking for top let me recommend htop.. it's top.. with some colors and extra bling bling =)
2009-08-04T22:23:00.000Z	arleslie	Slart	I like htop :)
2009-08-04T22:23:00.000Z	Slart	arleslie	it's addictive.. I never use top any more =)
2009-08-04T22:24:00.000Z	arleslie	Slart	it'll be great when my laptop freezes again instade of killing everything
2009-08-04T22:24:00.000Z	Slart	arleslie	indeed
2009-08-05T00:14:00.000Z	Slart	arleslie	perhaps.. but probably not.. there isn't a newer one available?
2009-08-05T00:14:00.000Z	arleslie	Slart	I'm looking for a deb package for libpq4 but the only one I found was for dapper
2009-08-05T00:16:00.000Z	Slart	arleslie	libpq4.. postgres client? that's at version 5 now.. you really need v4 ?
2009-08-05T00:16:00.000Z	arleslie	Slart	I just need a libpq4
2009-08-05T00:17:00.000Z	Slart	arleslie	hmm.. let me search a bit..
2009-08-05T00:17:00.000Z	arleslie	Slart	ok, but the v4 worked with my program
2009-08-05T00:18:00.000Z	Slart	arleslie	what happens if you symlink libpq5 to libpq4? I don't know if it's backwards compatible or not
2009-08-05T00:19:00.000Z	arleslie	Slart	symlink??
2009-08-05T00:19:00.000Z	Slart	arleslie	yes.. you create a link that is called libpq4 but it points to libpq5.. very handy
2009-08-05T00:19:00.000Z	Slart	arleslie	kind of like a shortcut
2009-08-05T00:20:00.000Z	Slart	arleslie	but if you can find a libpq4 that works for you, go with that
