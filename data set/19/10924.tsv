2006-04-23T06:48:00.000Z	NanoBCN		Hi people. Stupid question. Can I mount an ftp share with the "mount" utility?
2006-04-23T06:48:00.000Z	nopcode_	NanoBCN	yupo
2006-04-23T06:48:00.000Z	nopcode_		ehrm 'yup'
2006-04-23T06:49:00.000Z	NanoBCN	nopcode_	thanks, do you remember the syntax?
2006-04-23T06:49:00.000Z	nopcode_	NanoBCN	no, never used it
2006-04-23T06:49:00.000Z	NanoBCN		I'm experiencing very weird things when mounting it from the GUI
2006-04-23T06:49:00.000Z	nopcode_		from what gui?!
2006-04-23T06:49:00.000Z	NanoBCN		folders change name if start with numbers and hide their content
2006-04-23T06:50:00.000Z	NanoBCN		GUI = Desktop application "Connect to a server"
2006-04-23T06:50:00.000Z	nopcode_		sys settings?
2006-04-23T06:50:00.000Z	nopcode_		weird
2006-04-23T06:50:00.000Z	NanoBCN		Places -> Connect to a server
2006-04-23T06:50:00.000Z	nopcode_		are we talking about linux?
2006-04-23T06:51:00.000Z	nopcode_		weird
2006-04-23T06:51:00.000Z	NanoBCN		and I was wondering that if I mount it from command line I might have a better result
2006-04-23T06:51:00.000Z	NanoBCN		Ubuntu 5.10 here
2006-04-23T06:51:00.000Z	nopcode_	NanoBCN	you should do everything from the command line
2006-04-23T06:51:00.000Z	nopcode_		for flexibility and verbosity
2006-04-23T06:52:00.000Z	NanoBCN	nopcode_	indeed, that's my opinion too, but since I don't remember now the syntax I gave a try to the GUI
