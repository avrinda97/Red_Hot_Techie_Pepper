2009-03-02T04:06:00.000Z	cdenny		im using vista right now on a custom built computer.  I hate vista.  I want to use ubuntu, but have questions.  I am a student of multimedia design so I have all adobe apps as well as 3ds max; which I understand are not available in ubuntu.
2009-03-02T04:06:00.000Z	cdenny		why should I use ubuntu?
2009-03-02T04:06:00.000Z	cdenny		vista is just wrong sometimes.
2009-03-02T04:07:00.000Z	sglasser	cdenny	have you considered a mac?
2009-03-02T04:07:00.000Z	cdenny		for example, a few minutes ago, i came out of sleep mode, and my screen went black but my mouse was still visible.  I could barely move it though
2009-03-02T04:07:00.000Z	cdenny	sglasser	I have a macbook
2009-03-02T04:08:00.000Z	cdenny		I had to do a hard restart
2009-03-02T04:08:00.000Z	sglasser	cdenny	cant your mac run all the apps you need?  plus it is Unix after all :)
2009-03-02T04:09:00.000Z	cdenny	sglasser	macbook is too slow. I use it for mundane tasks, but most of the work is with my custom desktop
2009-03-02T04:10:00.000Z	sglasser	cdenny	how bout a refurbished macbook pro?
2009-03-02T04:10:00.000Z	cdenny	sglasser	im a poor college student
2009-03-02T04:11:00.000Z	cdenny		maybe i should try to fix vista, it seems kinda slow for being quad core with 8gb of ram
2009-03-02T04:12:00.000Z	sglasser	cdenny	microsoft is trying to fix vista--maybe you should grab win 7 beta
2009-03-02T04:12:00.000Z	cdenny	sglasser	i have thought about
2009-03-02T04:12:00.000Z	cdenny		it
2009-03-02T04:12:00.000Z	cdenny		can i do an upgrade?
2009-03-02T04:12:00.000Z	sglasser	cdenny	have you tried gimp + ufraw?
2009-03-02T04:12:00.000Z	cdenny		because I really dont want to have to reinstall all of my apps
2009-03-02T04:13:00.000Z	cdenny	sglasser	I tried gimp but its lacking a lot compared to cs4
