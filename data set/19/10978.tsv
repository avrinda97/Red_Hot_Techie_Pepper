2006-04-15T06:01:00.000Z	Sanne	whmice	well, other than finding a computer with internet access and get the files from there I really don't know of other options.
2006-04-15T06:02:00.000Z	whmice		i cant find a downloadable tarball of the source and i dont know any other way
2006-04-15T06:04:00.000Z	Sanne	whmice	do you need the kernel source?
2006-04-15T06:05:00.000Z	whmice		yes
2006-04-15T06:05:00.000Z	Sanne	whmice	please type my name when replying so I get alerted when you talk to me. You can do this:
2006-04-15T06:06:00.000Z	whmice	Sanne	like so?
2006-04-15T06:06:00.000Z	Sanne	whmice	note down your kernel version with 'uname -a'
2006-04-15T06:06:00.000Z	Sanne	whmice	yesm that's fine, thanks :)
2006-04-15T06:06:00.000Z	whmice	Sanne	2.6.12
2006-04-15T06:07:00.000Z	Sanne	whmice	go to a friend with internet access, go to packages.ubuntu.com, search for the kernel package.
2006-04-15T06:07:00.000Z	Sanne	whmice	you might only need kernel-headers-<your-version>, not the whole package, though. It's a smaller download.
2006-04-15T06:07:00.000Z	whmice	Sanne	im currently running windows from a dual boot
2006-04-15T06:08:00.000Z	Sanne	whmice	the go to packages.ubuntu.com to learn how to do it for later. Type in "kernel-headers" in the package search box.
2006-04-15T06:09:00.000Z	Sanne	whmice	tell me when you're done.
2006-04-15T06:12:00.000Z	whmice	Sanne	i think i found it its a .deb
2006-04-15T06:13:00.000Z	Sanne	whmice	yeah, you can download a deb from there, copy it to your linux partition, and install it with dpkg -i <packagename>. Voila :)
2006-04-15T06:14:00.000Z	whmice	Sanne	 thanks i hope it works
2006-04-15T06:14:00.000Z	Sanne	whmice	good luck. Remember that the version must match exactly the kernel you are using.
