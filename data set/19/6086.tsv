2008-03-16T07:40:00.000Z	brent113		So i have an ubuntu swap question: my system manager says using 0 out of 0, but the ram is completely used and the system is lagging.  What's the problem?
2008-03-16T07:40:00.000Z	nikrud	brent113	you don't have any swap
2008-03-16T07:41:00.000Z	nikrud	brent113	did you create a swap partition when you installed?
2008-03-16T07:42:00.000Z	brent113	nikrud	ahh, I think I know the problem, I moved a couple partitions around and might have renamed it.
2008-03-16T07:42:00.000Z	nikrud	brent113	that'll do it
2008-03-16T07:42:00.000Z	brent113	nikrud	so I have a swap, but it changed from sda5 to sda2, how do I update ubuntu
2008-03-16T07:42:00.000Z	nikrud	brent113	in /etc/fstab , change the partition that swap is expected on.  blkid in a terminal will tell you the uuid of your partitions
2008-03-26T06:52:00.000Z	nikrud	brent113	won't work, it's not a package in an ubuntu repo
2008-03-31T07:02:00.000Z	nikrud	brent113	try   sudo apt-get remove --purge <that package> , that will get rid of that file /etc/X11/Xsession.d/39keytouch-acpid
2008-03-31T07:03:00.000Z	nikrud	brent113	the real problem is the last line
2008-03-31T07:05:00.000Z	brent113	nikrud	I don't have the exact same error as this guy. Here's mine: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/61698/
2008-03-31T07:06:00.000Z	nikrud	brent113	put a copy of    gedit  ~/.profile    on http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org
2008-03-31T07:07:00.000Z	brent113	nikrud	yea, I was looking at that but I have no clue how to fix it, thanksf or lookign at it
2008-03-31T07:07:00.000Z	nikrud	brent113	I have a generic replacement for you, that is so totally the wrong content for that file, a sec
2008-03-31T07:08:00.000Z	brent113	nikrud	OOOO i know what happened.  compiz saved its settings to that file.  thanks, the replacement will fix it
2008-03-31T07:10:00.000Z	brent113	nikrud	thanks for the help, talk to you later
2008-03-31T07:10:00.000Z	nikrud	brent113	working? good
