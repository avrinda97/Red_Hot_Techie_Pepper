2005-11-06T16:01:00.000Z	pppoe_dude		where can i find more info on setting up two network cards on the same computer?
2005-11-06T16:01:00.000Z	andi5	pppoe_dude	do you want to setup some type of router?
2005-11-06T16:03:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	andi5	im trying to connect a copmuter to the main network and directly to another computer via crossover cable
2005-11-06T16:03:00.000Z	andi5	pppoe_dude	so you do not want the other computer to be part of the network?
2005-11-06T16:03:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	andi5	but ubuntu is not allowing me to start both interfaces and ping both computers
2005-11-06T16:04:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	andi5	maybe, but for now i just need them to "see" each other and for the main one to access the internet
2005-11-06T16:04:00.000Z	andi5	pppoe_dude	what did you try and why did not work?
2005-11-06T16:05:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	andi5	well... i tried the obvious... set up the two interfaces with different IP's, but it seems that only one of them can access its network  at any one given point
2005-11-06T16:06:00.000Z	andi5	pppoe_dude	try to take a look at /etc/network/interfaces (sudo gedit <file>)
2005-11-06T16:07:00.000Z	andi5	pppoe_dude	you should have eth0 and eth1, ... ifconfig lists the running interfaces, ifup eth0  e.g. brings eth0 up, ifdown does the opposite
2005-11-06T16:07:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	andi5	i am well aware of that... however, go to #pastebin :P (i know thats not what you meant... but go there and ill show you my ifconfig)
2006-06-26T13:50:00.000Z	andi5	pppoe_dude	security updates, you should really remove the hash (#), if you have any servers running
2006-06-26T13:50:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	andi5	hmm.. well it seems to include updates to xserver-drivers... and im running this from an ssh session... i dont want to install these updates if they will make my computer not boot
2006-06-26T13:52:00.000Z	andi5	pppoe_dude	if you do not start/need x, why should ssh be unreachable just because x does not start? *onwdering*
2006-06-26T13:53:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	andi5	im fixing a friends computer
2006-06-26T13:53:00.000Z	andi5	pppoe_dude	i would include it and hope that it works nonetheless (why should ssh stop to work?)
2006-06-26T13:54:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	andi5	i c.
2006-06-26T13:55:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	andi5	what about kernel modules? will any new modules added to "/etc/modules" be affected by updating the kernel?
2006-06-26T13:55:00.000Z	andi5	pppoe_dude	hehe.... who knows :)
