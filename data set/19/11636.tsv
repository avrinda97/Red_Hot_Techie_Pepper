2006-10-05T13:00:00.000Z	jldugger	czer323	i think the usabiltiy studies are what's killing gnome's nautilus
2006-10-05T13:01:00.000Z	czer323		jldugger> how so?
2006-10-05T13:01:00.000Z	czer323		holycow> that's because it's so intuitive. ;)
2006-10-05T13:02:00.000Z	jldugger	czer323	well, spatial nautilus for one
2006-10-05T13:02:00.000Z	czer323		jldugger> spatial is disabled by default in ubuntu.
2006-10-05T13:02:00.000Z	czer323	jldugger	and it's actually a similar feature to mac's finder.  top right has a button to hide all the extra fluff, aka shortcuts, back buttons etc.
2006-10-05T13:03:00.000Z	czer323		holycow> teaching people something would cost too much time for people.  Which is why you make products FOR people.  They want to do things.  Not learn how to do things.
2006-10-05T13:05:00.000Z	jldugger	czer323	removing the location bar in favor of the boxes seems to have pissed one guy off who's gone about claiming gnome is slowly copying older and older versions of Mac
2006-10-05T13:06:00.000Z	czer323		jldugger> uh, you can turn the location bar back on.
2006-10-05T13:06:00.000Z	czer323	jldugger	or just hit ctrl-l to start typing in the folder you wanna go to.
2006-10-05T13:07:00.000Z	czer323	jldugger	hell, next time you're in nautilus, notice how you can type the folder's name and it will highlight.  hit enter, it's in that folde.r  Way easier than remembering exact spelling of folders without seeing them.
2006-10-05T13:07:00.000Z	jldugger	czer323	yea, autocomplete is nice
2006-10-05T13:07:00.000Z	czer323		jldugger> not just autocomplete.  that's been around forever.  Just navigating and selecting folders in nautilus.
2006-10-05T13:08:00.000Z	czer323	jldugger	which is why I applaud the fact that linux is becoming easier to use.  Why should things be hard to use?  Would you make kids goto a school to learn things the hard way when there are newer better ways of doing thigns?
2006-10-05T13:08:00.000Z	czer323		aka, graphic calculator or using pen and paper?
2006-10-05T13:08:00.000Z	czer323		if it's easier... why not use it.
2006-10-05T13:09:00.000Z	czer323		Wow, this isn't offtopic? ;)
2006-10-05T13:09:00.000Z	jldugger	czer323	he's just a kde fanatic, and i partly agree. it just seems like changes occur not because they're better but because thats how os9 did it
