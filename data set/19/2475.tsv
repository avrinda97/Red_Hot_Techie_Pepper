2010-08-13T18:58:00.000Z	BobSapp		scripts init bottom does anyone know what that is? its the last thing i see when booting before i get a blank screen
2010-08-13T19:00:00.000Z	BobSapp		I just tried booting in recovery mode and it halts the computer after it says someting about scripts/init-bottom
2010-08-13T19:01:00.000Z	BobSapp		i think theres a big difference between the kernel on the 10.04 cd and the one thats actually installed
2010-08-13T19:02:00.000Z	BobSapp		i cant even get to gdm FoolsRun. it looks like the computer halts some point during bootup(capslock light doesnt respond)
2010-08-13T19:04:00.000Z	BobSapp		ok after some googleing it looks like i have to kopt=nomodeset in grub
2010-08-13T19:06:00.000Z	Oer	BobSapp	maybe this page is any help > i915.modeset=1 or i915.modeset=0; nVidia: nomodeset; Generic: xforce  http://ubuntu-tutorials.com/2010/05/06/ubuntu-10-04-lucid-blank-screen-at-startup-workaround/

2010-08-13T19:20:00.000Z	BobSapp		either its radeon.nomodeset=0
2010-08-13T19:20:00.000Z	BobSapp		or its the fact that i still had the ubuntu cd in the drive
2010-08-13T19:21:00.000Z	BobSapp		ty

2010-08-13T19:27:00.000Z	BobSapp		radeon.modeset=0 fixes it
