2011-11-20T07:27:00.000Z	eusid		yes
2011-11-20T07:27:00.000Z	eusid		visudo
2011-11-20T07:27:00.000Z	brjannc	eusid	you need to use the visudo command
2011-11-20T07:27:00.000Z	eusid		wont let me edit it
2011-11-20T07:28:00.000Z	eusid		even as root?
2011-11-20T07:28:00.000Z	brjannc		ack, I'm just an echo, ignore me :)
2011-11-20T07:28:00.000Z	eusid		I have to sudo as root
2011-11-20T07:28:00.000Z	eusid		well the group it has is %sudo
2011-11-20T07:28:00.000Z	eusid		not admin
2011-11-20T07:28:00.000Z	eusid		I wanted to change it to admin
2011-11-20T07:28:00.000Z	eusid		and I wanted to add user
2011-11-20T07:30:00.000Z	eusid		no not what I am looking for. the file comes up by visudo but it is unwritable Im guessing from root I need to chdmod the privs?
2011-11-20T07:31:00.000Z	eusid		alias to exec long commands quickly, bash script to execute a series of actions from a file
2011-11-20T07:31:00.000Z	eusid		ahh wq! okay thats what I was looking for I believe thank you I will try it
2011-11-20T07:33:00.000Z	eusid		I don't use vim as my normal editor Im a fairly new python guy so I actually am using jetbrains python ide for its django support very good for dev with django
2011-11-20T07:34:00.000Z	brjannc	eusid	for reference, visudo uses whatever your EDITOR environment variable is; so if you ran e.g. EDITOR=/usr/bin/nano visudo, it would use nano instead
2011-11-20T07:34:00.000Z	eusid		thank you much imbezol
2011-11-20T07:35:00.000Z	eusid	brjannc	yeah I am familiar with that command and setting an editor unfortunately it doesnt have nano so I will have to install. however I don't see why it wont let me write as root and even opening it with gedit will not allow me to save it
