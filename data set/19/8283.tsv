2007-06-29T10:18:00.000Z	onexused		Can I get all users to use the same kppp configuration?  I don't want to have to do it for every one.
2007-06-29T10:20:00.000Z	DarkFame	onexused	it's a long time since I've used kppp, but it saves a config file in the home directory of the user. put it in all the users homes.
2007-06-29T10:21:00.000Z	DarkFame	onexused	if you haven't created the users yet, do as Frogzoo says.
2007-06-29T10:21:00.000Z	onexused	DarkFame	Do you know offhand what the file is called?  I don't see it in ~ or ~/.kde.
2007-06-29T10:23:00.000Z	DarkFame	onexused	no, sorry. take a look in the home dir (ls -la).. or try using lsof when the app is running to see which files are open.
2007-06-29T10:34:00.000Z	DarkFame	onexused	have you checked /etc ?
2007-06-29T10:35:00.000Z	onexused	DarkFame	looking now
2007-06-29T10:38:00.000Z	DarkFame	onexused	/usr/share/doc/HTML/en/kppp/global-settings.html
2007-06-29T10:39:00.000Z	onexused	DarkFame	I really should have installed docs for kppp, eh?
2007-06-29T10:40:00.000Z	DarkFame	onexused	it isn't there?
2007-06-29T10:40:00.000Z	onexused	DarkFame	no.
2007-06-29T10:40:00.000Z	onexused	DarkFame	Thanks for the help.  Found it in ~/.kde/share/config/kppprc.
2007-06-29T10:41:00.000Z	DarkFame	onexused	great, now you need to put that file in each home directory. the easiest way is to copy it to /etc/skel (preserving the directory stricture)
2007-06-29T10:41:00.000Z	onexused	DarkFame	ok
2007-06-29T10:42:00.000Z	onexused	DarkFame	The users do already exist.  I'll copy it to their homes and chown it.
2007-06-29T10:42:00.000Z	onexused	DarkFame	or symlink from somewhere public
2007-06-29T10:42:00.000Z	DarkFame	onexused	yeah, that would work. remember to chown and chgrp.
2007-06-29T10:43:00.000Z	onexused	DarkFame	Is there a good/standard place to store something like that?
2007-06-29T10:44:00.000Z	DarkFame	onexused	I suggest using /etc
