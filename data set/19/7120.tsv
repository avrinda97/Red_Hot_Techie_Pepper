2007-11-02T04:32:00.000Z	gecko89		I was wondering if anyone could help diagnose a problem I'm having with dual displays and an nvidia card under 7.10
2007-11-02T04:34:00.000Z	fluffman	gecko89	alt-f2, then type gksudo nvidia-settings
2007-11-02T04:35:00.000Z	gecko89	fluffman	it's saying I do not appear to be using the NVIDIA x driver
2007-11-02T04:36:00.000Z	fluffman	gecko89	 what card do you have?
2007-11-02T04:36:00.000Z	gecko89	fluffman	nVidia GeForce FX 5500
2007-11-02T04:36:00.000Z	fluffman		look in synaptic for (i think) nvidia-glx-new
2007-11-02T04:36:00.000Z	fluffman		if that doesn't work, try a legacy
2007-11-02T04:36:00.000Z	gecko89	fluffman	I've installed the restricted driver, it says it's in use
2007-11-02T04:37:00.000Z	fluffman	gecko89	good.  now check your /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2007-11-02T04:37:00.000Z	fluffman	gecko89	under device, it should say you are using "driver: nvidia"
2007-11-02T04:38:00.000Z	gecko89	fluffman	there are two devices listed, each one with driver "nvidia"
2007-11-02T04:39:00.000Z	fluffman	gecko89	check synaptic for nvidia-settings
2007-11-02T04:39:00.000Z	fluffman		you need that to set up dual monitors
2007-11-02T04:40:00.000Z	gecko89	fluffman	it says it will remove nvidia-glx-new, is that OK
2007-11-02T04:41:00.000Z	fluffman	gecko89	it shouldn't have to do that.  I would leave nvidia-glx-new alone
2007-11-02T04:41:00.000Z	fluffman		try restarting X and then running nvidia-settings again
2007-11-02T04:43:00.000Z	fluffman	gecko89	hope that works for you, but i've to got to go for now.  Sorry I couldn't be of more help, but that's all I had to do to get it working
2007-11-02T04:43:00.000Z	fluffman		be back later.
2007-11-02T04:43:00.000Z	gecko89	fluffman	thanks for the help anyway
