2007-04-22T15:10:00.000Z	orbin	SarahDavies	trying the ndiswrapper method?
2007-04-22T15:10:00.000Z	SarahDavies	orbin	yes, exactly
2007-04-22T15:11:00.000Z	orbin	SarahDavies	cabextract should work.  are you sure you have the right driver exe?
2007-04-22T15:11:00.000Z	orbin	SarahDavies	what exactly happened?
2007-04-22T15:12:00.000Z	SarahDavies	orbin	 I looked up the driver on http://ndiswrapper.sourceforge.net/mediawiki/index.php/List, so I'm fairly sure I have the right one
2007-04-22T15:12:00.000Z	SarahDavies	orbin	it says there aren't any cabinets in it
2007-04-22T15:16:00.000Z	orbin	SarahDavies	unshield didn't work either?
2007-04-22T15:16:00.000Z	SarahDavies	orbin	nope
2007-04-22T15:17:00.000Z	orbin	SarahDavies	what's the letter.number reference for your card on that list?

2007-04-22T15:23:00.000Z	orbin	SarahDavies	seemed to go ok for me. :-/
2007-04-22T15:23:00.000Z	SarahDavies	orbin	hmm, I wonder what I'm doing wrong, maybe it's objecting to me extracting to the desktop rather than a folder?
2007-04-22T15:25:00.000Z	orbin	SarahDavies	possibly.
2007-04-22T15:29:00.000Z	SarahDavies	orbin	it works now, thanks for your help!
