2007-09-05T08:08:00.000Z	Mastastealth		hey guys, I just updated this morning some stuff on the kernel, but now it seems I lost my GFX rendering. Looks like the restricted module is lagging behind a version or something, is that normal and when will the new one be out?
2007-09-05T08:10:00.000Z	Mastastealth		uh, so I can't have hardware acceleration till October? :P
2007-09-05T08:10:00.000Z	Mastastealth		is there a way to downgrade my kernel then?
2007-09-05T08:10:00.000Z	yjwong	Mastastealth	you don't have to downgrade the kernel
2007-09-05T08:11:00.000Z	yjwong		you could re-compile the kernel module for your driver
2007-09-05T08:11:00.000Z	Mastastealth	yjwong	and how would I go about doing that?
2007-09-05T08:12:00.000Z	yjwong		depending on your graphics card, Mastastealth
2007-09-05T08:12:00.000Z	Mastastealth		also, can someone check what version of the restricted-modules they have? I'm at 2.6.20.5-16.29...
2007-09-05T08:12:00.000Z	Mastastealth	yjwong	I use an Nvidia.
2007-09-05T08:13:00.000Z	yjwong	Mastastealth	you have installed the nvidia drivers through restricted-manager, then the drivers should still work
2007-09-05T08:13:00.000Z	yjwong		otherwise, you need to grab the installer from the nvidia site
2007-09-05T08:14:00.000Z	yjwong		and re-run the install like you did when installing the first time
2007-09-05T08:14:00.000Z	yjwong		i hope that helps :P
2007-09-05T08:14:00.000Z	Mastastealth		ugh.  I don't get what the problem is though. All the restricted-modules thing has to do is keep in sync with the kernel right? I don't have to go install or recompile from other sources when it can work with some simple apt-get management...:(
2007-09-05T08:15:00.000Z	yjwong		problem is, each new kernel upgrade will create a new directory in /lib/, and a new kernel will read from the new directory
2007-09-05T08:16:00.000Z	yjwong	Mastastealth	you can copy the old kernel module from the old directory to the new one, but i'm not sure whether that will work properly
2007-09-05T08:17:00.000Z	Mastastealth	yjwong	but its not a whole new kernel, its just a little update. from 2.6.20-16.28 to 16-31 or something...oh well. is it better to just wait, or should I just grab the Envy script?
2007-09-05T08:18:00.000Z	yjwong	Mastastealth	I think it is better to wait, I've heard of some problems caused by Envy. If you have an ATI card, then I would probably have known the steps for re-compiling the kernel module.
2007-09-05T08:18:00.000Z	Mastastealth	yjwong	All right. Thanks. Guess I'll have to live without Compiz for a bit. ;)
