2012-05-08T17:00:00.000Z	Adzz1	Gnea	im back, any ideas?
2012-05-08T17:01:00.000Z	Adzz1	Gnea	oh okay, should i be looking in anywhere else or just staying in here?
2012-05-08T17:02:00.000Z	Gnea	Adzz1	okay, I'm not entirely certain as to the legitimacy of the cchtml.com site... did you follow directions from there first or from the official ubuntu help site?
2012-05-08T17:04:00.000Z	Adzz1	Gnea	i first followed the instructions on the official ubuntu help site and i didnt really get far since i didnt understand most of it, then i went on the AMD.com site itself, downloaded the driver from there, installed it and got that same error that when i reboot it says there's a problem with my config, i then saw in the description of the download on AMD.com that there "unofficial" but maintained linux driver support wiki was the link i 
2012-05-08T17:04:00.000Z	Gnea	Adzz1	alright, so you installed from amd.com but didn't uninstall it?
2012-05-08T17:05:00.000Z	Adzz1	Gnea	well i assumed since i got the error, that it didnt work, so when i rebooted i tryed the flgrxinfo command, and it gave me that error, so then i installd the proprietary driver from the "Additional Drivers" manager and it gives me the same issue
2012-05-08T17:07:00.000Z	Gnea	Adzz1	okay, the problem is that you didn't uninstall what you installed from amd.com - there's a conflict going on. what you'll need to do is reverse the steps, making sure you remove anything ati-related from apt and also removing the driver that you installed from amd.com... if it was a script, it should have some sort of uninstall function that you can call by running --help with it
2012-05-08T17:07:00.000Z	Gnea	Adzz1	once you're done with all of that and you're sure that the system is clean of any ati/fglrx drivers, then you can proceed to start over
2012-05-08T17:08:00.000Z	Gnea	Adzz1	and just as a quick piece of advice, NEVER install a driver directly from a website in Ubuntu, that always leads to problems... you're not the first to make that mistake and certainly won't be the last. But this can be fixed and all will be well :)
2012-05-08T17:09:00.000Z	Adzz1	Gnea	its not a script, its a .run file and when i execute it, i get two options. A) Install Driver 8.961 on X.Org 6.9 or later 64-bit. B) Generate Distribution Specific Driver Package.
2012-05-08T17:09:00.000Z	Gnea	Adzz1	unless it's an official ubuntu website that tells you to install from a website like that, it's best not to
2012-05-08T17:09:00.000Z	Adzz1	Gnea	thanks gnea :), and where do you think i should start since its not a script?
2012-05-08T17:09:00.000Z	Gnea	Adzz1	yes, .run files are scripts. if you open a terminal and issue this command:  file ati-whatever.run  you will see that :)
2012-05-08T17:10:00.000Z	Gnea	Adzz1	obviously, replacing 'ati-whatever.run' with the actual name of the script
2012-05-08T17:11:00.000Z	Gnea	Adzz1	well, start with this:  dpkg -l | grep ^ii | grep fglrx
2012-05-08T17:11:00.000Z	Gnea	Adzz1	that will tell you what is installed for fglrx... just remove the results using apt-get remove
2012-05-08T17:12:00.000Z	Gnea	Adzz1	it sounds like Chuck_Norris may have done this as well :)
2012-05-08T17:13:00.000Z	Adzz1	Gnea	do all i need to go is uninstall the packages listed when i run the grep command or do i still have to uninstall the .run file?
2012-05-08T17:15:00.000Z	Adzz1	Gnea	ok, all have been uninstalled, where should i start now, from the ubuntu help forums you provided?
