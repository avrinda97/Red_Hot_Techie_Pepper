2007-05-17T09:15:00.000Z	crdlb	IGxMyzt	you should have full support with the open source driver
2007-05-17T09:17:00.000Z	IGxMyzt	crdlb	on 7.04? with access to beryl/games?
2007-05-17T09:17:00.000Z	crdlb	IGxMyzt	yes, it's not quite as fast as fglrx, but almost, and it runs beryl far better
2007-05-17T09:17:00.000Z	IGxMyzt	crdlb	so the Radeon drivers on the community pages?
2007-05-17T09:17:00.000Z	crdlb	IGxMyzt	you need to completely remove fglrx if you want the open source driver to work
2007-05-17T09:18:00.000Z	IGxMyzt	crdlb	how do i remove it?
2007-05-17T09:19:00.000Z	crdlb	IGxMyzt	depends on how you installed it
2007-05-17T09:19:00.000Z	crdlb	IGxMyzt	sudo apt-get --purge remove xorg-driver-fglrx
2007-05-17T09:19:00.000Z	IGxMyzt	crdlb	with a xorg reconfigure before i even got into ubuntu because it recognized my intel card for some reason
2007-05-17T09:57:00.000Z	crdlb	IGxMyzt	it should work fine, are you not using feisty?
2007-05-17T09:57:00.000Z	IGxMyzt	crdlb	I was on 6.10 when all these problems happened, and i just got feisty in my mail.
2007-05-17T09:58:00.000Z	crdlb	IGxMyzt	it should work out of the box (right on the livecd)
2007-05-17T09:58:00.000Z	IGxMyzt	crdlb	on 6.10 i got an xorg error saying no graphical monitor was found. has that problem been solved?
2007-05-17T09:58:00.000Z	crdlb	IGxMyzt	try it
2007-05-17T09:59:00.000Z	IGxMyzt	crdlb	or do i need to reconfigure imediately, like in 6.10
2007-05-17T10:05:00.000Z	crdlb	IGxMyzt	try the feisty live cd
2007-05-17T10:07:00.000Z	crdlb	IGxMyzt	you just got the feisty livecd in the mail right?
2007-05-17T10:07:00.000Z	IGxMyzt	crdlb	Yes?
2007-05-17T10:08:00.000Z	crdlb	IGxMyzt	direct rendering will work right on it if it's going to at all
