2012-05-26T18:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	BlueWolf	 why are you even doing this ramdom dd stuff?
2012-05-26T18:53:00.000Z	BlueWolf	Dr_Willis	To learn how to Zero a Hard Disk, which looks like I have done, now all I need to do is ( sudo dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/hda ) like it says on this site ( http://www.marksanborn.net/howto/wiping-a-hard-drive-with-dd/ )
2012-05-26T18:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	BlueWolf	 and whats the point of doing all this?
2012-05-26T18:56:00.000Z	BlueWolf	Dr_Willis	To learn. To remove data of a hard disk, May be I want to sell it sometime and I don't want my personal info to be accessed. Maybe I am paranoid.
2012-05-26T18:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	BlueWolf	 if you have zeroed it.. basically its gone..  spending another hr+ radomizeing it.. is pointless.
2012-05-26T18:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	BlueWolf	 and if you wanted to be the most 'secure' there are actual secuer deletion tools that would do a better job of it.
2012-05-26T18:59:00.000Z	BlueWolf	Dr_Willis	Ok then as a hacker how easy would it be to salvage that data? Could you give me a time line?
2012-05-26T19:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	BlueWolf	 there MIGHT be possible for profesional data services to recover it.. but we had this debate in here befor. ages ago it might have been easier. but these days.. not very likely
2012-05-26T19:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	BlueWolf	 if you are truely paranoid about security. you use a bulk eraser.. or a large hammer....
2012-05-26T19:02:00.000Z	BlueWolf	Dr_Willis	Are you talking about physically destroying the hard drive? Or using a magnet to destroy everything on it?
2012-05-26T19:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	BlueWolf	 both. :) if you really really want to be secure
2012-08-09T18:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	BlueWolf	 sounds like a bug to report
2012-08-09T18:46:00.000Z	BlueWolf	Dr_Willis	Would Updating help? Could you just confirm where that option is so I can just make sure?
2012-08-09T18:53:00.000Z	BlueWolf	Dr_Willis	It's in Preferences right?
2012-08-09T18:56:00.000Z	BlueWolf	Dr_Willis	Sorry I mean In Edit -> Plugins

2012-08-09T19:04:00.000Z	BlueWolf	Dr_Willis	Ok the notification window ( Shows the song cover, name and album) that pops up in the top right hand corner when you change a song? Where do you activate it in plugins - Which one is it?
