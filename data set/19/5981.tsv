2008-04-04T22:26:00.000Z	level09		hi, I want to add ubuntu next to my windows installation,  can I just download and install it  ?
2008-04-04T22:27:00.000Z	level09		should I check the box next to the "alternate CD" ?
2008-04-04T22:27:00.000Z	MrSteve	level09	- can you burn a cd with an ISO?
2008-04-04T22:28:00.000Z	level09	MrSteve	thanks, so its probably better to install it from a CD
2008-04-04T22:28:00.000Z	MrSteve	level09	Live CD can boot... if you have a cd-rom that is set to boot in your bios..
2008-04-04T22:29:00.000Z	level09	MrSteve	thanks :)  got it
2008-04-04T22:29:00.000Z	MrSteve	level09	------ get the ISO download, and Make the CD
2008-04-04T22:29:00.000Z	MrSteve	level09	if you cannot burn a bootable CD from the ISO, then get disks mailed to you
2008-04-04T22:30:00.000Z	MrSteve	level09	Be aware of everything before you try to use the CD
2008-04-04T22:30:00.000Z	level09	MrSteve	THanks , I guess I can burn it :)

2008-04-04T22:31:00.000Z	MrSteve	level09	-- gnome will get it done for you..
2008-04-04T22:32:00.000Z	MrSteve	level09	---- thing is, you should have Windows CD and rescue disk at hand.. and know about how tha repair and re-install might work
2008-04-04T22:33:00.000Z	level09	MrSteve	is it possible that my windows will be corrupt ?
