2008-10-25T10:01:00.000Z	wsa		as root!
2008-10-25T10:02:00.000Z	wsa		one of the cool things I am noticing about ubuntu is that vi is not aliased to vim
2008-10-25T10:02:00.000Z	wsa		s/cool/annoying/
2008-10-25T10:03:00.000Z	dr_willis	wsa	 err.. vi by default is 'vim-tiny' i do belive. in a normal install...
2008-10-25T10:09:00.000Z	dr_willis	wsa	 im not sure it did.. but i am just testing 64bit on the new laptop . I think some packages I installed DID grab that stuff however.. so
2008-10-25T10:09:00.000Z	dr_willis	wsa	 it installed it very soon after i installed. :) if it wasent there by default
2008-10-25T10:12:00.000Z	wsa	dr_willis	what issues? I just installed 64 bit ubuntu clandestinely on a work laptop (core 2)
2008-10-25T10:13:00.000Z	dr_willis	wsa	 i  hear theres no 64bit skype yet.. but other then that.. ive not really had many issues.. I am testing 8.10 so. my issues coule be 8.10 related. not 64bit related. :)
2008-10-25T10:13:00.000Z	dr_willis	wsa	 i have rarely had flash issues. :) but i dont YouTube much
2008-10-25T10:14:00.000Z	dr_willis	wsa	 I do think it was the ubuntu-restrcted-extras package that grabbed flash and those compatiablity libs. :)
2008-10-25T10:51:00.000Z	dr_willis	wsa	 sudo passwd USERNAME     is what i normally do
2008-10-25T10:52:00.000Z	wsa	dr_willis	no I was just making fun of WHATSHISNAME who obviously was asking for help taking over someone ELSE's machine
2008-10-25T10:53:00.000Z	dr_willis	wsa	 :) ok.. that sort of thing often gets lost in translation on irc. :)
