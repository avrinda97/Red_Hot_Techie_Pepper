2009-06-29T13:22:00.000Z	Garp		Hi.
2009-06-29T13:22:00.000Z	Garp		Yesterday I asked about how to maintain a machine that has no internet connection. For answer, I got:
2009-06-29T13:22:00.000Z	Garp		!offline
2009-06-29T13:23:00.000Z	Garp		Such an answer was not really good. Because it doest say *how* to get the package list on the offline machine.
2009-06-29T13:23:00.000Z	Nehyx	Garp	you want update machine without internet, is that?
2009-06-29T13:24:00.000Z	Garp	Nehyx	yes.
2009-06-29T13:24:00.000Z	Nehyx	Garp	use lts versions and download 8.04.1, 8.04.2... versions
2009-06-29T13:24:00.000Z	Garp	Nehyx	the whole one ?
2009-06-29T13:26:00.000Z	Nehyx	Garp	I always used ubuntu with internet, and if you hasn't got internet, updates are innecesary ;-)
2009-06-29T13:26:00.000Z	Garp	Nehyx	it fix bugs, allow for new pkgs, etc.
2009-06-29T13:26:00.000Z	Nehyx	Garp	yes, but the most bugs are security
2009-06-29T13:27:00.000Z	Garp	Nehyx	or enhancements.
2009-06-29T13:27:00.000Z	Nehyx	Garp	and the most packets, firefox, evolution... needs internet
2009-06-29T13:27:00.000Z	Garp	Nehyx	I know that a internet is good, but in that case, I dont have.
2009-06-29T13:28:00.000Z	Nehyx	Garp	try to install new packets from another PC, I never tested that :P
2009-06-29T13:29:00.000Z	Garp	Nehyx	well, there are a few problems. You want to be able to perform 'apt-get update' and then 'apt-get upgrade'
2009-06-29T13:29:00.000Z	Garp	Nehyx	"downloading pkgs you need' is "apt-get upgrade"
2009-06-29T13:30:00.000Z	Nehyx	Garp	you can buy a wifi in ebay, and go to free wifi zones :)
2009-06-29T13:30:00.000Z	Garp	Nehyx	If you have some money to give me,, I can have internet access ofor that machine, if you dont, we'll do without.
