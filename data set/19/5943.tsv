2008-12-21T05:50:00.000Z	darkfuzion		because someone said to install windows first
2008-12-21T05:51:00.000Z	darkfuzion		and i tried to install linux first lol
2008-12-21T05:51:00.000Z	darkfuzion		but oh well i still can make a partition right?
2008-12-21T05:51:00.000Z	darkfuzion		i know i asked that and they said no
2008-12-21T05:52:00.000Z	darkfuzion		but i can go and make a partion
2008-12-21T05:52:00.000Z	darkfuzion		with the cd
2008-12-21T05:52:00.000Z	C0p3rn1c	darkfuzion	sure, if you left space, it shouldn't be such a big problem
2008-12-21T05:54:00.000Z	C0p3rn1c	darkfuzion	yes you can
2008-12-21T05:54:00.000Z	C0p3rn1c	darkfuzion	did you do a manual or automatic partitioning ?
2008-12-21T05:55:00.000Z	C0p3rn1c	darkfuzion	you can resize your partitions from a live cd, with a partition manager
2008-12-21T05:56:00.000Z	C0p3rn1c	darkfuzion	yeah, but you have to boot from a live cd
2008-12-21T05:57:00.000Z	C0p3rn1c	darkfuzion	you can't resize a partition you are using
2008-12-21T05:59:00.000Z	C0p3rn1c	darkfuzion	yes create a ntfs partion with GParted
2008-12-21T06:00:00.000Z	C0p3rn1c	darkfuzion	boot from a live cd, launch GParted, use it to resize your partition to make room for a ntfs windows partion, create a ntfs partition, reboot, boot from the windows cd
2008-12-21T06:00:00.000Z	C0p3rn1c	darkfuzion	and then just install windows on the ntfs partion you created
2008-12-21T06:02:00.000Z	C0p3rn1c	darkfuzion	ok good luck
2008-12-21T06:02:00.000Z	C0p3rn1c	darkfuzion	still there ?
2008-12-21T06:04:00.000Z	C0p3rn1c	darkfuzion	after you install windows, windows will probebly reset the boot sector, so you'll have to fix it from the live cd and set it back to grub
2008-12-21T06:06:00.000Z	C0p3rn1c	darkfuzion	you could use wine of vmware or ... to replace windows
