2006-06-08T08:51:00.000Z	mrmist	richiefrich	I'm trying gparted now, but it won't let me choose "resize"
2006-06-08T08:51:00.000Z	mrmist	richiefrich	Am I doing something wrong ?
2006-06-08T08:51:00.000Z	richiefrich	mrmist	well do u have on selected ?
2006-06-08T08:52:00.000Z	richiefrich	mrmist	 what part.  type ?
2006-06-08T08:52:00.000Z	mrmist	richiefrich	of course. I'm right clicking ON the disk
2006-06-08T08:52:00.000Z	mrmist		it's an ext 3 partition type
2006-06-08T08:52:00.000Z	richiefrich	mrmist	 that maybe why
2006-06-08T08:53:00.000Z	mrmist	richiefrich	doesn't help to choose my ntfs-partition either
2006-06-08T08:53:00.000Z	richiefrich	mrmist	 if it's jfs i kow u can enlarge them
2006-06-08T08:53:00.000Z	mrmist	richiefrich	maybe it's because I've got an op.sys on both ??
2006-06-08T08:53:00.000Z	richiefrich	mrmist	thats not supported the ntfs... only experimental
2006-06-08T08:53:00.000Z	mrmist	richiefrich	But the installer managed ?
2006-06-08T08:54:00.000Z	richiefrich	mrmist	managed what
2006-06-08T08:54:00.000Z	mrmist	richiefrich	I had winxp on the machine. The installer resized the partition, and made a new ext3 partition to install Kubuntu
2006-06-08T08:55:00.000Z	richiefrich	mrmist	yes it does that.. but resizing them... is different
