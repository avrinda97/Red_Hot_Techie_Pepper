2005-03-16T17:57:00.000Z	Echylo		amule sucky :P
2005-03-16T17:57:00.000Z	Echylo		amule won't download anything here at fast speeds
2005-03-16T17:57:00.000Z	Echylo		if I use torrent I get 300 kbs
2005-03-16T17:58:00.000Z	Echylo		I download 5,5gig music with torrent on 5 days
2005-03-16T17:58:00.000Z	Echylo		I prefer bittornado
2005-03-16T15:20:00.000Z	Echylo		hellow
2005-03-16T15:20:00.000Z	Echylo		can I say that limewire kinda rocks
2005-03-16T15:21:00.000Z	apokryphos	Echylo	it sure does :P
2005-03-16T15:22:00.000Z	apokryphos	Echylo	yup, gnutella network has always been the best for me.
2005-03-16T15:22:00.000Z	apokryphos	Echylo	yup; and irc
2005-03-16T15:24:00.000Z	apokryphos	Echylo	irc is for speeedy downloads
2005-03-16T15:24:00.000Z	apokryphos	Echylo	Sure. Never quite reached the consistent speeds with torrents though.
2005-03-16T15:25:00.000Z	apokryphos	Echylo	consistently?
2005-03-16T15:26:00.000Z	apokryphos	Echylo	for all your downloads? Just what tracker are you using?
2005-03-16T15:26:00.000Z	apokryphos	Echylo	oh. I've been talking about films here :P
2005-03-18T12:46:00.000Z	apokryphos	Echylo	they're not ;-)
2005-03-18T12:46:00.000Z	apokryphos	Echylo	it depends on where you go; have you been in #debian?
2005-03-18T12:47:00.000Z	apokryphos	Echylo	sounds odd-ish to me. I'd imagine fellow Gnome-ers would be more agreeagle. But, you can't take one visit in a channel obscure your thoughts on what it's like, at other times.
2005-03-21T09:25:00.000Z	apokryphos	Echylo	you are, but your distro [ubuntu]  is surely not :D
