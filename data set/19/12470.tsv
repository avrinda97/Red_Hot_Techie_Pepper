2007-06-02T12:03:00.000Z	sahil		lol, a more "soft" solution?
2007-06-02T12:03:00.000Z	sahil		i wanna hold of, cuz if i get anew one it will be a macbook
2007-06-02T12:04:00.000Z	sahil		i have a 1.7 Ghz with 1 gig ram
2007-06-02T12:04:00.000Z	sahil		but my FSB is only 600 MHz
2007-06-02T12:04:00.000Z	mneptok	sahil	and Ubuntu is slow when compared to ... ?
2007-06-02T12:04:00.000Z	sahil		It is fine, just a lil slow with beryl
2007-06-02T12:05:00.000Z	mneptok	sahil	so don't use Beryl
2007-06-02T12:05:00.000Z	sahil		I have a 256 MB ATI card
2007-06-02T12:05:00.000Z	mneptok	sahil	in a laptop?
2007-06-02T12:06:00.000Z	sahil		its a year old, just doesnt handle the full screen fire on close smoothly
2007-06-02T12:07:00.000Z	sahil		I am thinking of upgrading this one so i can use it for like another 3 years or so
2007-06-02T12:07:00.000Z	sahil		my lappy is 2 years old
2007-06-02T12:07:00.000Z	mneptok	sahil	dude. you're seriously asking how to "speed up Ubuntu" because one effect of a bleeding edge unsupported compositor is "a little slow"?  :)
2007-06-02T12:08:00.000Z	sahil		yes
2007-06-02T12:09:00.000Z	sahil	qman	can u suggest a good card
2007-06-02T12:09:00.000Z	sahil		nooooooooo
2007-06-02T12:09:00.000Z	sahil		with nvidia you get the black window bug
2007-06-02T12:09:00.000Z	mneptok	sahil	you can't replace the graphics in your laptop, can you?
