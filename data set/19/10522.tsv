2006-06-08T10:55:00.000Z	Jemt_	Frogzoo	Oh, ok :(
2006-06-08T10:40:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Jemt_	which vid card u using?
2006-06-08T10:40:00.000Z	Jemt_	Frogzoo	ATI Radeon Mobility M6 (default drivers)
2006-06-08T10:41:00.000Z	Jemt_	Frogzoo	Is it a known issue with ATI ?
2006-06-08T10:41:00.000Z	Jemt_	Frogzoo	It is SO frustrating. I'm crazy about Dapper. It is great. But I haft to downgrade to Breezy if the problem cannot be solved
2006-06-08T10:44:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Jemt_	does this radeon have a model number other than M6? eg 9700 or such?
2006-06-08T10:44:00.000Z	Jemt_	Frogzoo	Don't think so - but let me see what the Device Manager says
2006-06-08T10:45:00.000Z	Jemt_	Frogzoo	This is what Device Manager displays : "Radeon Mobility M6 LY"
2006-06-08T10:45:00.000Z	Jemt_	Frogzoo	Maybe 'dmesg' displays more. Give me a sec
2006-06-08T10:46:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Jemt_	nothing to lose by trying the fglrx drivers, give us a sec to check ati's site...
2006-06-08T10:47:00.000Z	Jemt_	Frogzoo	Ok, thanks. 'dmesg' wasn't helpful either
2006-06-08T10:52:00.000Z	Jemt_	Frogzoo	That is weird indeed. Well, I'll give the fglrx driver a try. Thanks alot - appriciate it :)
2006-06-08T10:55:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Jemt_	turns out your radeon predates the 8500 - so the fglrx driver won't work :(
2006-06-08T10:56:00.000Z	Jemt_	Frogzoo	What a shame. Then I haft to go back to Breezy or find another distro :(
2006-06-08T10:56:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Jemt_	maybe try tinkering with xorg.conf - eg: http://five.pairlist.net/pipermail/linux-laptop/2002-July/000537.html
2006-06-08T10:56:00.000Z	Jemt_	Frogzoo	Checking
2006-06-08T10:57:00.000Z	Jemt_	Frogzoo	Almost a shame to go back to VESA. But fortunately, I don't need hardware accelleration - so I guess that solution would be ok. I'll give it a try :)
2006-06-08T10:58:00.000Z	Jemt_	Frogzoo	Oh, dinner is on the table. I'll keep you updated on progress in about 20 minutes :)
2006-06-08T10:59:00.000Z	Jemt_	Frogzoo	Ok, thanks :)
