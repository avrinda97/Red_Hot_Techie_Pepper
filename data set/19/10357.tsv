2007-07-14T08:33:00.000Z	compengi	skulrid	why don't you just do "ps aux | grep program" take the pid number then "sudo kill -9 pid"
2007-07-14T08:33:00.000Z	skulrid		but why all that work if theres killall?
2007-07-14T08:34:00.000Z	skulrid		i realy think  linux is getting more n more complicated and useless...
2007-07-14T08:35:00.000Z	compengi	skulrid	because with killall you need to know the exact name of the program but with "ps aux | grep program" you would be actually searching for the program's processes then kill it using "kill -9 pid"
2007-07-14T08:36:00.000Z	compengi	skulrid	that's the best way of doing things
2007-07-14T08:36:00.000Z	skulrid		hum
2007-07-14T08:36:00.000Z	compengi	skulrid	nothing is going complicated it just the matter of habit and how you are used to do
2007-07-14T08:38:00.000Z	skulrid	compengi	we need to spend a weekend to know how to install a program, another to know how to find and load that program, another to close it..... man im on ubuntu for a long time now but I feell like going back cause I just dont have the time to learn all this complicated things.....
2007-07-14T08:45:00.000Z	compengi	skulrid	well let me tell you something, i was using windows for 7 years and that's my first year using linux. at first i had the same feeling, that things are complicated and such, but when i went through several stages, i found out that it's the matter of habit. know i can't imagine my self clicking next, next, then finish. i feel like someone is laughing at me, because i want to know what i'm doing, not just see how installing application process ru
