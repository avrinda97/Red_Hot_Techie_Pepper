2009-11-16T03:17:00.000Z	Cainus		hey does anyone know why my ubuntu machine might not be able to resolve my windows machine name anymore?
2009-11-16T03:18:00.000Z	ikonia	Cainus	no dns ?
2009-11-16T03:18:00.000Z	Cainus	ikonia	seems like just a "local" dns thing... I mean... I can get to freenode...
2009-11-16T03:19:00.000Z	ikonia	Cainus	ok, so no local dns
2009-11-16T03:20:00.000Z	Cainus	ikonia	seems like just windows names though... is there a service for that?
2009-11-16T03:20:00.000Z	ikonia	Cainus	depends what you configured it to use
2009-11-16T03:21:00.000Z	ikonia	Cainus	did you tell it to join a domain for example
2009-11-16T03:21:00.000Z	Cainus	ikonia	for some reason I think it needs to run nmbd... does that make sense?
2009-11-16T03:21:00.000Z	ikonia	Cainus	yes
2009-11-16T03:23:00.000Z	Cainus	ikonia	k... I'm not sure how to do that ... just typing nmbd doesn't seem to change anything
2009-11-16T03:23:00.000Z	ikonia	Cainus	look in /etc/init.d for the script
2009-11-16T03:24:00.000Z	Cainus	ikonia	there's no nmbd script in there
2009-11-16T03:24:00.000Z	ikonia	Cainus	is it installed ?
2009-11-16T03:24:00.000Z	Cainus	ikonia	yeah... no error... should I be running the samba script from /etc/init.d ?
2009-11-16T03:25:00.000Z	Cainus	ikonia	any idea how to test if it's running?
2009-11-16T03:25:00.000Z	ikonia	Cainus	ps -ef | grep nmb
2009-11-16T03:26:00.000Z	Cainus	ikonia	looks like it's running... it still has the old IP for my windows machine though
2009-11-16T03:26:00.000Z	Cainus	ikonia	is there a way to flush dns on linux (I imagine there is)
2009-11-16T03:28:00.000Z	ikonia	Cainus	some interesting options in the man page http://optics.ph.unimelb.edu.au/help/samba/nmbd.8.html
