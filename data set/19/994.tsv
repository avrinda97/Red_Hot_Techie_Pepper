2011-06-20T14:20:00.000Z	Meeow		erm, any help for file sharing per ssh ?
2011-06-20T14:20:00.000Z	p1oooop	Meeow	you can try fuse...
2011-06-20T14:21:00.000Z	p1oooop	Meeow	or an even crazier method using dd...  man dd   for that...
2011-06-20T14:21:00.000Z	p1oooop	Meeow	it's in the man page, I believe...
2011-06-20T14:22:00.000Z	p1oooop	Meeow	you can also look up the man page on google...
2011-06-20T14:24:00.000Z	Meeow	p1oooop	i folowed this tutorial http://my.opera.com/ubuntunerd1/blog/share-files-between-two-ubuntu-computers-via-ssh and it keeps asking the password. I dont really get why ?
2011-06-20T14:24:00.000Z	p1oooop	Meeow	your SSH server?
2011-06-20T14:27:00.000Z	Meeow	p1oooop	do you know any other way to share a load of files between 2pc's ?
2011-06-20T14:27:00.000Z	p1oooop	Meeow	you can try samba...
2011-06-20T14:28:00.000Z	p1oooop	Meeow	it's not too hard, there's a GUI for it...
2011-06-20T14:28:00.000Z	p1oooop	Meeow	and it works with windows (and mac, I think) machines too..
2011-06-20T14:28:00.000Z	Meeow	p1oooop	that looks nice .. ill try that. thankies.
2011-06-20T14:28:00.000Z	p1oooop	Meeow	basically you right click and click on the "share" button.
2011-06-20T14:29:00.000Z	Meeow	p1oooop	 i made everything like in the tutorial but keeps asking me the passw. thats the problem.
2011-06-20T14:30:00.000Z	p1oooop	Meeow	is it not working?
2011-06-20T14:30:00.000Z	p1oooop	Meeow	as in your password
2011-06-20T14:30:00.000Z	Meeow	p1oooop	ouch. sorry its surely because of our new livebox.I gotta reconf this to allow port 22 i guess
2011-06-20T14:31:00.000Z	p1oooop	Meeow	nowonder I like doing it through terminal better... XD
2011-06-20T14:31:00.000Z	p1oooop	Meeow	less ambiguation, IMHO.
