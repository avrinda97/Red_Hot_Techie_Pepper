2006-06-26T14:37:00.000Z	TheoMurps	trappist	It is a realtek RTL-8139/8139C/8139C+ (rev10). I also tried the dhclient again to see exactly what it said as it tried to get an IP, and it said DHCPDISCOVER on eth0 to 255.255.255.255 port 67, interval 7. Does this mean it doesn't know the IP of the DHCP server?
2006-06-26T14:37:00.000Z	trappist	TheoMurps	sudo modprobe 8139cp
2006-06-26T14:37:00.000Z	TheoMurps	trappist	it is loaded.
2006-06-26T14:38:00.000Z	TheoMurps	trappist	I tried that yesterday and if I do lsmod, 8139cp is already there.
2006-06-26T14:38:00.000Z	trappist	TheoMurps	it doesn't need to know the ip of the dhcp server - it broadcasts, and any dhcp server on the network can respond
2006-06-26T14:38:00.000Z	trappist	TheoMurps	then try sudo modprobe -r 8139cp (to unload it) and sudo modprobe 8139too (to try an alternate driver)
2006-06-26T14:39:00.000Z	TheoMurps	trappist	I will try that and then boot back to XP with my results (or hopefully not have to reboot, and be able to let you know via ubuntu if it works)
2006-06-26T14:39:00.000Z	trappist	TheoMurps	cool
2006-06-26T14:40:00.000Z	trappist	TheoMurps	hang on a sec...
2006-06-26T14:40:00.000Z	trappist	TheoMurps	after doing both of those, type 'dmesg' and have a look at the output
2006-06-26T14:47:00.000Z	TheoMurps	trappist	I lsmod and actulaly have both 8139cp and 8139too loaded at startup. Could that be the problem? It is whatever ubuntu installer set up for me automatically.
2006-06-26T14:50:00.000Z	trappist	TheoMurps	the first driver loaded that supports your device is the one that will be used for it.  so, unload (modprobe -r) both of them and try one at a time
2006-06-26T14:50:00.000Z	TheoMurps	trappist	I will do that now. Thanks.
2006-06-26T15:07:00.000Z	TheoMurps	trappist	 When I modprobe -r 8139too, eth0 as an interface completely vanishes (ifconfig eth0 up says no such device). Removing 8139cp and loading 8139too brings eth0 back, but the same problems persist. A static IP cannot ping my gateway, and dhclient gives me the same errors.
2006-06-26T15:07:00.000Z	trappist	TheoMurps	did you happen to look at the output of dmesg after you loaded that driver? (I asked you to but you may have already left)
2006-06-26T15:07:00.000Z	TheoMurps	trappist	Nope, I'd already left. I'll check dmesg now. Be right back.
2006-06-26T15:27:00.000Z	TheoMurps	trappist	What message did you want? When I unload 8139cp ther ei snothing
2006-06-26T15:27:00.000Z	TheoMurps	trappist	when I remove 8139too I get
2006-06-26T15:29:00.000Z	TheoMurps	trappist	8139too Fast Ethernet driver 0.9.27; ACPI: ... ->GSI 18 (level, low)->IRQ 193; RealTek8139 at 0xblahblah 00:e0:blah IRC 193; eth0 Identified 8139 chip type `RTL-8139C'; link up, 100Mbps, full-duplex, lpa 0x45e1, and then a few minutes later I get Tx descriptor 0 is 0002000 (queue head); descriptor 1 2 and 3 are the same; then eth0: link up, 100Mbps full-duplex, lpa 0x45E1
