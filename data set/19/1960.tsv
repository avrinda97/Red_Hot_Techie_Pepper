2010-08-17T10:37:00.000Z	ry0n	Jordan_U	does this imply that it's a good candidate for fixing with something else?
2010-08-17T10:38:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ry0n	I doubt that the partition table was actually changed, so you just have a filesystem that's half resized. I don't know what the best tool for fixing it is, but I don't think you should change the partition table as that could lead you to accidentily overwrite data
2010-08-17T10:39:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ry0n	What filesystem?
2010-08-17T10:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ry0n	Since you were growing it rather than shrinking it I think that makes it more likely to be recoverable, since existing files / metadata likely didn't have to be moved.
2010-08-17T10:42:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ry0n	It does :(
2010-08-17T10:42:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ry0n	Do you have the log from gparted?
2010-08-17T10:43:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ry0n	Ahh, I thought it was a software error rather than lost power.
2010-08-17T10:50:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ry0n	Switched places?
2010-08-17T11:07:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ry0n	Stop leaving :)
2010-08-17T11:07:00.000Z	ry0n	Jordan_U	Sorry, was setting up and testing my auto-joins in xchat.
2010-08-17T11:08:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ry0n	How far into the resize do you think it was before you lost power?
2010-08-17T11:09:00.000Z	ry0n	Jordan_U	I actually have no idea. it was very early when I left (like 8% of the bar, still verifying or whatever) but I came back hours later and the system had rebooted.
2010-08-17T11:10:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ry0n	Can you fit a full drive backup somewhere?
2010-08-17T11:11:00.000Z	ry0n	Jordan_U	size of physical drive or size of data on drive/
2010-08-17T11:11:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ry0n	Size of physical drive.
2010-08-17T11:12:00.000Z	ry0n	Jordan_U	what would that do for me if I could though?
2010-08-17T11:13:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ry0n	It would mean that you could try possibly destructive fixes without worrying too much.
2010-08-17T11:16:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ry0n	For a resize "to the left" testdisk may actually help. If you set the partition start back to where it was then the superblock might still be there and the filesystem might be still mountable. I don't know what the likelyhood of that is though.
