2011-09-17T20:54:00.000Z	LjL		Foxmaster: the Windows installer, if by that you mean Wubi, will not let you boot directly from Ubuntu. there will be an icon in Windows' Start menu, i think
2011-09-17T20:55:00.000Z	FoxtrotZero	LjL	Nothing new in my start menu. It's another operating system, isn't the concept that I can start the computer running it?
2011-09-17T20:55:00.000Z	LjL	FoxtrotZero	not if you install it from Windows
2011-09-17T20:55:00.000Z	LjL	FoxtrotZero	you must install it from the live CD for that
2011-09-17T20:55:00.000Z	FoxtrotZero	LjL	So the windows version is like running Ubuntu INSIDE Windows?
2011-09-17T20:56:00.000Z	LjL	FoxtrotZero	i can't say i'm very familiar with it, but it is at least started from within Windows, and it uses a file on your Windows HD as its "virtual hard drive"
2011-09-17T20:57:00.000Z	LjL	FoxtrotZero	oh, i'm being told the option to start Ubuntu is probably in the Windows boot menu, accessible by pressing F8 if i remember correctly
2011-09-17T20:57:00.000Z	FoxtrotZero	LjL	Alright then, so is it possible to install in such that when I start my computer, I have the option of running Win- Oh, alright.
2011-09-17T20:57:00.000Z	FoxtrotZero	LjL	Why do you not reccomend Wubi?
2011-09-17T20:58:00.000Z	LjL	FoxtrotZero	i didn't say i don't recommend it... but well, it seems much saner to me to install it as another OS alongside Windows. the whole your-hard-drive-being-really-a-Windows-file thing doesn't sound too good to me, at the very least it will impact speed
2011-09-17T20:58:00.000Z	FoxtrotZero	LjL	Sorry, that was dr_willis
2011-09-17T20:59:00.000Z	FoxtrotZero	LjL	But yeah, that makes sense
2011-09-17T21:00:00.000Z	FoxtrotZero	LjL	So it's possible - and I'm sure I know the answer - to install Ubuntu alongside Windows such that when I start my computer, I can select either Windows or Ubuntu?
2011-09-17T21:04:00.000Z	LjL	FoxtrotZero	sure, the normal install from the live CD automatically shrinks your Windows partition (though a backup is advised, of course), and then recognizes your Windows install and lets you select at boot
2011-09-17T21:07:00.000Z	FoxtrotZero	LjL	Is it possible for me to create a third partition (my computer came with a D:/ partition for 'system restore') in which I install Ubuntu, and Windows and Ubuntu basically leave each other alone?
2011-09-17T21:07:00.000Z	LjL	FoxtrotZero	yeah, should be done automatically in that case too. but you do have the option (the installer asks you) to set up the partitions manually, as well
2011-09-17T21:10:00.000Z	FoxtrotZero	LjL	Also, how much space is required for this install? I have a 2GB flash drive, and some 700MB CDRs, but that's it. Am I going to be able to do this?
2011-09-17T21:10:00.000Z	LjL	FoxtrotZero	a partition editor. anyway if you already have 2 partitions, you've got just enough room for Ubuntu (since Ubuntu normally requires two partitions, its main one and the one for swap / virtual memory)
2011-09-17T21:11:00.000Z	LjL	FoxtrotZero	you need to burn Ubuntu to one CD, and that's it
