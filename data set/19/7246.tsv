2007-09-30T14:08:00.000Z	Jowi	Rageon	depends on the seed. some seeds are quicker than others. if you get that speed no matter what seed it can be your ISP that is limiting the traffic or that your router (if you have one) is misbehaving.
2007-09-30T14:09:00.000Z	Jowi	Rageon	yes but those 400 seeds might be in himalaya and you in northpole.
2007-09-30T14:24:00.000Z	Jowi	Rageon	to much traffic on the road inbetween your house and basestation. ;)
2007-09-30T14:24:00.000Z	Jowi	Rageon	I think magnetron is correct in his calculations though. i think you're maxed out on your download speed.
2007-09-30T14:25:00.000Z	Rageon	Jowi	if that were true it would be 39.89 all the time or close to it.. not jumping between 45 and 12 kbs
2007-09-30T14:31:00.000Z	Jowi	Rageon	open gconf-editor. set /apps/gnome-btdownload/settings/max_port to 6889
2007-09-30T14:35:00.000Z	Jowi	Rageon	using only 1 port will get you slow speeds.
2007-09-30T14:35:00.000Z	Jowi	Rageon	bittorrent is quite dynamic in its connections.
2007-09-30T14:39:00.000Z	Jowi	Rageon	forwarding request is what a router is for :)
