2008-08-06T21:56:00.000Z	lakitu		hey - i got another comp, not the one i was working on yesterday. it had linux & also win xp on it with GRUB as a bootloader. i got a virus on the win, & had to format. i lost the loader. now i know there's guides to reinstalling the loader, but i want to know how i can tell if my linux partition is still there, & working? (is it risky to tell it to boot to it, when it's corrupted/formatted/etc?)
2008-08-06T21:57:00.000Z	lakitu		sorry - not the most eloquent discourse on my problem..
2008-08-06T21:58:00.000Z	lakitu		it must've been, right?
2008-08-06T21:58:00.000Z	lakitu		on a different partition
2008-08-06T21:58:00.000Z	lakitu		lol =)
2008-08-06T21:58:00.000Z	lakitu		me too
2008-08-06T21:59:00.000Z	lakitu		do just 'live cd -> grub -> check?'
2008-08-06T21:59:00.000Z	joetheodd	lakitu	if you reinstalled windows, you probably overwrote grub with windows' bootloader
2008-08-06T21:59:00.000Z	joetheodd	lakitu	yeah reinstall grub off of live
2008-08-06T21:59:00.000Z	joetheodd	lakitu	actually, try to just mount a few /dev/hd* or /dev/sd* and see if there's linux on them
2008-08-06T21:59:00.000Z	lakitu	joetheodd	ok. important: there is no risk of installing GRUB (is there??) if there is no linux partition?
2008-08-06T22:00:00.000Z	joetheodd	lakitu	correct. worst case scenario is you can't get into windows and have to reformat again (and since you need to reformat windows every other week anyhow, that's nothing big :P )
2008-08-06T22:01:00.000Z	lakitu	joetheodd	no no no! very wrong. this is my main comp, with 750 gigs on it. i can't afford to reformat this. even if it is just a 100gig partition for windows
2008-08-06T22:02:00.000Z	joetheodd	lakitu	oh!
2008-08-06T22:02:00.000Z	lakitu	joetheodd	yes =)
2008-08-06T22:02:00.000Z	joetheodd	lakitu	well grub should detect windows, and if not, you need to manually config
2008-08-06T22:02:00.000Z	lakitu	joetheodd	ok, so it IS possible to get boot back into windows if GRUB "hides" it, or whatever?
2008-08-06T22:03:00.000Z	joetheodd	lakitu	yes, you need to get the MBR to find it though
2008-08-06T22:04:00.000Z	lakitu	joetheodd	thanks, i'll be back
