2005-10-20T14:41:00.000Z	agent_		anyone know what can cause ifconfig to have a bad mac address?
2005-10-20T14:41:00.000Z	theRealGlick	agent_	it cant
2005-10-20T14:41:00.000Z	theRealGlick	agent_	seems like a bad card
2005-10-20T14:42:00.000Z	agent_	theRealGlick	it DOES, and its not bad. it worked prior to upgrading to breezy
2005-10-20T14:42:00.000Z	theRealGlick	agent_	what card?
2005-10-20T14:42:00.000Z	agent_	theRealGlick	in fact, its so screwed up that i have multiple entries... maybe this is a network-admin problem (old config scewing something up?)
2005-10-20T14:43:00.000Z	agent_	theRealGlick	aironet wifi on thinkpad... its not the card...
2005-10-20T14:43:00.000Z	theRealGlick	agent_	ahh wifi
2005-10-20T14:44:00.000Z	theRealGlick		are your wifi tools installed
2005-10-20T14:44:00.000Z	theRealGlick		?
2005-10-20T14:44:00.000Z	theRealGlick		for wifi you iwconfig
2005-10-20T14:44:00.000Z	theRealGlick	agent_	use iwconfig
2005-10-20T14:45:00.000Z	agent_	theRealGlick	everything is installed... it works sometimes... it always dies now after suspend... and sometimes it boots with bad mac too
2005-10-20T14:45:00.000Z	theRealGlick	agent_	yeah there is a suspend problem especially if you have nvidia that screws up network settings amoung other things
2005-10-20T14:45:00.000Z	agent_	theRealGlick	iwconfig is not at fault... its something with Breezy's boot stuff or w/ the newer kernel module
2005-10-20T14:46:00.000Z	agent_	theRealGlick	i have ati... and it all worked fine before upgrade to breezy
2005-10-20T14:46:00.000Z	agent_	theRealGlick	it's not suspend's fault because it happens without it sometimes too
2005-10-20T14:47:00.000Z	agent_	theRealGlick	my guess is that suspend just always starts whatever causes the screwup that sometimes happens on boot
2005-10-20T14:47:00.000Z	agent_	theRealGlick	also i noticed that bluetooth support (modules and all) starts up at boot and i dont have bluetooth!! it wont even stop loading if i remove the rc links
