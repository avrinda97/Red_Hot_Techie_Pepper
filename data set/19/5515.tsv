2008-06-14T23:30:00.000Z	Ienorand		Hi all, how do I find out what driver and version my wireless uses, I'm suspecting madwifi but want to be sure...
2008-06-14T23:31:00.000Z	wiz_works	Ienorand	in most cases wext works for many wifi interfaces.
2008-06-14T23:32:00.000Z	wiz_works	Ienorand	is this a USB wifi device or PCI?
2008-06-14T23:33:00.000Z	wiz_works	Ienorand	atheros should work...   but are you using WPA encryption?
2008-06-14T23:34:00.000Z	wiz_works	Ienorand	ok one sec...
2008-06-14T23:35:00.000Z	wiz_works	Ienorand	madwifi should work with most atheros chips
2008-06-14T23:37:00.000Z	wiz_works	Ienorand	did you try running iwconfig to see what it shows ?  sometimes in the nickname it gives a hint at what driver/version
2008-06-14T23:38:00.000Z	wiz_works	Ienorand	look in the info for ath0  do you see a field called "nickname"?
2008-06-14T23:39:00.000Z	wiz_works	Ienorand	for example: IEEE 802.11b/g  ESSID:"wizworks.net"  Nickname:"zd1211"
2008-06-14T23:40:00.000Z	wiz_works	Ienorand	what do you see towards the bottom when you type lsmod?
2008-06-14T23:42:00.000Z	wiz_works	Ienorand	type lsmod and then look for something near "pci"  should list the modules loaded for that card.
2008-06-14T23:43:00.000Z	wiz_works	Ienorand	also you can type dmesg when you toggle the wifi card...   and see what shows up.
2008-06-14T23:44:00.000Z	wiz_works	Ienorand	toggle the wifi card again and then type dmesg.  It should output something pertaining to the card and give a clue as to what's going on./
2008-06-14T23:46:00.000Z	wiz_works	Ienorand	type this: lsmod | grep ieee80211
2008-06-14T23:48:00.000Z	wiz_works	Ienorand	if the drivers for the card are loaded, it SHOULD return something...   could it be that the atheros/madwifi drivers aren't loaded?
2008-06-14T23:50:00.000Z	wiz_works	Ienorand	you got me on this one...  what type of card is it?
2008-06-14T23:51:00.000Z	wiz_works	Ienorand	brand I mean...
2008-06-14T23:53:00.000Z	wiz_works	Ienorand	well, then it's definitely got something loaded...  I'm stumped
2008-06-14T23:55:00.000Z	wiz_works	Ienorand	good luck!
