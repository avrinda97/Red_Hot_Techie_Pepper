2005-06-11T15:50:00.000Z	Chislon		anyone willing to help me?
2005-06-11T15:51:00.000Z	Chislon		ok thank you
2005-06-11T15:52:00.000Z	Chislon		my attention is elsewhere for a bit though, ill return later, thank you
2005-06-11T15:53:00.000Z	Chislon		if i want to install a program with this, do i do it the same as i do with mandriva?
2005-06-11T15:54:00.000Z	Chislon		why is it that freebsd doesnt use gnome or kde by default and that the linux things all seem to like those best?
2005-06-11T15:55:00.000Z	forced	Chislon	Because the default desktop is based on the distribution. Just because it's BSD or Linux doesn't mean anything.
2005-06-11T15:55:00.000Z	Chislon	forced	well i mean why is it that FreeBSD decided on xfce over the others?
2005-06-11T15:56:00.000Z	forced	Chislon	Ask FreeBSD. :P Maybe they wanted a lighter desktop. Gnome/KDE are kind of considered bloated.
2005-06-11T15:56:00.000Z	Chislon	forced	this is the FreeBSD channel :)
2005-06-11T15:57:00.000Z	forced	Chislon	Try them both. Heh.
2005-06-12T09:05:00.000Z	forced	Chislon	OpenGL is portable... that's what they tend to use for graphics.
2005-06-12T09:06:00.000Z	Chislon	forced	ok i dont know how all the engines and stuff work though, so they use other engines tho
2005-06-12T14:25:00.000Z	forced	Chislon	www.pathname.com/fhs - Might help you understand the directory structure.
2005-06-12T14:26:00.000Z	Chislon	forced	thank you
2005-06-12T14:27:00.000Z	forced	Chislon	You're likely to mess something up on ANY os if you're new.
2005-06-12T14:28:00.000Z	forced	Chislon	General rule of thumb for swap is memory * 2... Unless it's over a gig, then a gig of swap is fine.
2005-06-12T14:29:00.000Z	Chislon	forced	ok thanks, and all the webpages i read say that the old memory * 2 rule is no longer a good rule of thumb, that that was for older comps when you hardly had memory
2005-06-12T14:29:00.000Z	forced	Chislon	That's why I said over a gig = set it to a gig of swap. :P That's where the benefits begin to of the rule of thumb start to dissipate.
2005-06-12T14:31:00.000Z	Chislon	forced	ok... so is 1 gig of swap good if i have 736mb of ram, or ur saying i should do 1472mb of swap?
