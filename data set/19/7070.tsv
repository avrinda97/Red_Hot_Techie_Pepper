2008-01-20T11:03:00.000Z	akorn		 can anyone explain how my logitech keyboard's shortcut for calculator actually works in ubuntu with no configuration? hah
2008-01-20T11:03:00.000Z	spdf	akorn	mine too :D Microsoft
2008-01-20T11:03:00.000Z	spdf	akorn	must be some kind of standard
2008-01-20T11:03:00.000Z	akorn	spdf	so weird eh? but the other shortcuts don't work except volume and probably pause/play
2008-01-20T11:04:00.000Z	akorn	spdf	yea probably; i already found it crazy enough that the volume dial on mine works too hah
2008-01-20T11:04:00.000Z	spdf	akorn	the ones that dont work might have some weird scan codes
2008-01-20T11:04:00.000Z	akorn	spdf	scan codes? i'm not that smart haha
2008-01-20T11:04:00.000Z	spdf	akorn	System -> Preferences -> Keyboard Shortcuts.. Try to set one up
2008-01-20T11:04:00.000Z	akorn	spdf	i'm running a laptop and i have this keyboard attached via usb, but it doesn't work at the GRUB boot menu (sometimes i boot into windows)....but it works at the login for ubuntu; any ideas?
2008-01-20T11:05:00.000Z	spdf	akorn	sometimes theres a BIOS setting for usb stuff related to mice/keyboards
2008-01-20T11:05:00.000Z	akorn	spdf	yea i was thinkign that might be it; i didn't notice these keyboard shortcuts here! nice
2008-01-20T11:06:00.000Z	spdf	akorn	if the key isn't recognized (doesn't do anything when you press it during the capture) then its some weird scan code, and you've got to do some magic to get 'em to work
2008-01-20T11:06:00.000Z	akorn	spdf	thanks a lot; actually all of them are registering :D
2008-01-20T11:07:00.000Z	spdf	akorn	nice
2008-01-20T11:07:00.000Z	akorn	spdf	do you know how i can add my own keyboard shortcut for custom programs (i.e. skype)?
2008-01-20T11:07:00.000Z	spdf	akorn	I'm just ssh'd in, so I can't see my desktop. but I believe there's a way to launch a custom launcher
2008-01-20T11:08:00.000Z	akorn	spdf	hmm i'll just google it and stop being lazy haha
2008-01-20T11:08:00.000Z	spdf	akorn	lol, okay
2008-01-20T11:08:00.000Z	akorn	spdf	alright i'm getting out of here...thanks a lot
