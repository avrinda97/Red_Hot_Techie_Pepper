2005-10-17T13:56:00.000Z	Orborde		So I set up Breezy, and things work, for the most part. But I still get the double-clock-speed/50% CPU at idle problem.
2005-10-17T13:56:00.000Z	Orborde		Any idea how to fix them?
2005-10-17T13:57:00.000Z	Hendric	Orborde	why not try 686 kernel if you are on intel
2005-10-17T13:57:00.000Z	Orborde	Hendric	I'm on AMD64
2005-10-17T13:58:00.000Z	Orborde	Hendric	I then flipped on over to the K7 kernel, because it seemed more in line with my system.
2005-10-17T13:58:00.000Z	Hendric	Orborde	it think 386 would be better..
2005-10-17T13:59:00.000Z	Hendric	Orborde	 haven't you tried the kernel for 64's??? its a different ISO
2005-10-17T14:00:00.000Z	Orborde	Hendric	I tried the AMD64 distro, but realized that nothing is actually compiled for 64-bit yet, such as Flash and things. And since I'm not running anything computationally intensive, I switched to 32-bit.
2005-10-17T14:18:00.000Z	Orborde	Hendric	Naw, that CAN'T be important....
2005-10-17T14:43:00.000Z	Orborde	Hendric	Yes.
2005-10-17T14:49:00.000Z	Orborde	Hendric	SOMEONE clearly knows how to do it, since it changeed between Hoary and Breezy....
2005-10-17T14:49:00.000Z	Hendric	Orborde	yeah.. who could that be?
2005-10-17T14:52:00.000Z	Orborde	Hendric	Internet!
2005-10-17T14:52:00.000Z	Hendric	Orborde	OMG forgot that...
2005-10-17T15:07:00.000Z	Orborde	Hendric	Yeah, though I'd rather use Gnomebaker.
2005-10-17T15:07:00.000Z	Orborde	Hendric	#ubuntu = DDoSed
2005-10-17T15:08:00.000Z	Hendric	Orborde	lolx
2005-10-17T15:13:00.000Z	Hendric	Orborde	sudo -H -s does
2005-10-17T15:16:00.000Z	Orborde	Hendric	sudo passwd might allow you to reset it?
