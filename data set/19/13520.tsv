2005-03-17T12:07:00.000Z	Levander		Anybody know how to change the domain name?
2005-03-17T12:08:00.000Z	luciux	Levander	you say the DNS ip?
2005-03-17T12:09:00.000Z	Levander	luciux	on my machine when I type hostname --fqdn, I get localhost.localdomain.  Would rather this be my name on the network
2005-03-17T12:09:00.000Z	Levander	luciux	it causes problems with mysql I'm thinking
2005-03-17T12:10:00.000Z	luciux	Levander	you can alter it with hostname the_name
2005-03-17T12:11:00.000Z	Levander	luciux	no, hostname can't alter the fqdn, it can only alter the hostname
2005-03-17T12:11:00.000Z	luciux	Levander	and the same domainname the_name
2005-03-17T12:11:00.000Z	Levander	luciux	no, "man domainname" explicitly says u can't
2005-03-17T12:13:00.000Z	luciux	Levander	i see.. what about altering your /etc/hosts?
2005-03-17T12:13:00.000Z	Levander	luciux	to what?
2005-03-17T12:14:00.000Z	luciux	Levander	to specify your right fqdn
2005-03-17T12:15:00.000Z	Levander	luciux	but how to I alter it to specify my right fqdn?
2005-03-17T12:17:00.000Z	luciux	Levander	if you say on /etc/hosts which is you fqdn for your ip it could work, doesn't it?
2005-03-17T12:17:00.000Z	Levander	luciux	do I assume every time I'm looking for my own machine that it's asking for the name of 127.0.0.1, and change the FQDN of that ip from localhost.localdomain, to what it should be, bread.highhat.net?
2005-03-17T12:18:00.000Z	Levander	luciux	i'm trying to figure out how to put my correct FQDN in hosts.  I don't know the format to use.
2005-03-17T12:20:00.000Z	luciux	Levander	IP fqdn hostname
2005-03-17T12:20:00.000Z	Levander	luciux	yeah, i got it, thanks for your help!
2005-03-17T12:20:00.000Z	luciux	Levander	you're welcome
2005-03-17T12:20:00.000Z	luciux	Levander	 :)
