2010-12-30T19:36:00.000Z	bibic682		hello, bought a new optical mouse. it acts buggy in 9.04 left click doubles sometimes and other probs...any fix?
2010-12-30T19:37:00.000Z	Dcite	bibic682	Are sure the mouse isn't defective?
2010-12-30T19:39:00.000Z	bibic682	Dcite	 I bought 3 and they all do the same in ubuntu and work fine in Winxp
2010-12-30T19:40:00.000Z	Dcite	bibic682	Odd.. I've only had happen on one of my very old logitech mice.. (double and triple clicks on single click randomly)
2010-12-30T19:41:00.000Z	Dcite	bibic682	Uness you mean it double clicks almost every time?
2010-12-30T19:41:00.000Z	bibic682	Dcite	That is exactly what happens
2010-12-30T19:41:00.000Z	Dcite	bibic682	How can you tell it's double clicking?
2010-12-30T19:42:00.000Z	bibic682		one click will do what a double does
2010-12-30T19:42:00.000Z	Dcite	bibic682	So for example it'll highlight a word if you click on it once?
2010-12-30T19:43:00.000Z	bibic682		double click to open a program opens 2
2010-12-30T19:45:00.000Z	bibic682		sometimes highlite won't stay highlited when you let off the click....various annoying probs
2010-12-30T19:46:00.000Z	Dcite	bibic682	(Ubuntu wise, programs open in ONE click so do files.. the hightlight...)
2010-12-30T19:47:00.000Z	bibic682	Dcite	not from my icon on desktop
2010-12-30T19:50:00.000Z	bibic682		Dcite:another annoyance....I click on bookmarks in Firefox and when I move pointer away it sometimes closes
2010-12-30T19:50:00.000Z	bibic682		kida hard to explain....just I know it isn't right
2010-12-30T19:51:00.000Z	Dcite	bibic682	Unfortunately I have no idea what the cause can be =/
2010-12-30T19:51:00.000Z	Dcite	bibic682	Even if you say it works fine in XP, to me it sounds more on the fauty side.. sorry you'll have to try someone else.
2010-12-30T19:51:00.000Z	bibic682		Thats ok ... I purchased another brand of mouse online and I'm waiting for it to arrive
2010-12-30T19:52:00.000Z	Dcite	bibic682	What is your current one? (only used logitech mice personally)
