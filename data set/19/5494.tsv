2008-06-17T22:24:00.000Z	Tillux	pub	what does not work
2008-06-17T22:25:00.000Z	pub	Tillux	idk, i installed java but when i go to the java webpage to `test java` it says Applet could not be initialized
2008-06-17T22:25:00.000Z	pub	Tillux	do i need ot do anything else besides `sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jre`
2008-06-17T22:25:00.000Z	Tillux	pub	yes, you do
2008-06-17T22:25:00.000Z	pub		Tillux-_-;;
2008-06-17T22:25:00.000Z	Tillux	pub	you will have to install the java browser plugin for your browser, i think
2008-06-17T22:26:00.000Z	pub	Tillux	oh ok, thank you, i will look it up for firefox
2008-06-17T22:30:00.000Z	Tillux		okay guys, I need to compile "FreeImage" on a 64bit machine; the FreeImage team explicitly says, that they'd got linux64bit support. The problem is, make will exit with an error like "Error: no matching method for calling »MIN(int&, long int)«" which i daresay is because of the 64bit-ness of my machine... the question is: try making with the --ignore switch or shall i better try "linux32 make" ?
2008-06-17T22:32:00.000Z	pub		Tillux; it still doesn't work :(
2008-06-17T22:33:00.000Z	Tillux	pub	type "about:addons" in your firefox adress-bar
2008-06-17T22:33:00.000Z	Tillux	pub	ah well that's deprecated
2008-06-17T22:33:00.000Z	pub		Tilluxl huh?
2008-06-17T22:34:00.000Z	pub		Tillux; although it should bring me to the screen it says that url is invallid
2008-06-17T22:34:00.000Z	Tillux	pub	try extras->add-ons -> plugins instead
2008-06-17T22:35:00.000Z	Tillux	pub	there should either be a sun firefox plugin, or a "GCJ Web Browser Plugin (using IcedTea) 1.0"
2008-06-17T22:35:00.000Z	Tillux	pub	if not, you either didn't restart firefox or did not install the proper plugin ;)
2008-06-17T22:36:00.000Z	pub		Tillux; addons.mozilla.org is sooo slow
2008-06-17T22:37:00.000Z	Tillux	pub	oh, choose the tab "plugins", between "languages" and "installation"
