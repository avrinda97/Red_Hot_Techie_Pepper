2008-05-30T15:17:00.000Z	hopelessguy		:|
2008-05-30T15:17:00.000Z	hopelessguy		i'm really desperate atm
2008-05-30T15:18:00.000Z	anirudh0	hopelessguy	you can disable compiz's check for supported driver..if you are willing to risk it..google for details
2008-05-30T15:18:00.000Z	hopelessguy	anirudh0	i have tried it
2008-05-30T15:18:00.000Z	hopelessguy	anirudh0	result = reboot because the desk goes black :P
2008-05-30T15:18:00.000Z	anirudh0	hopelessguy	running compiz from terminal is generally more helpful..in terms of error messages
2008-05-30T15:18:00.000Z	hopelessguy	anirudh0	yeah
2008-05-30T15:27:00.000Z	anirudh0	hopelessguy	compiz and kubuntu dont mix
2008-05-30T15:28:00.000Z	anirudh0	hopelessguy	you have to start compiz before kwin or something like that
2008-05-30T15:28:00.000Z	anirudh0	hopelessguy	new version of kubuntu supports it though..so a fix should be out...google
2008-05-30T15:29:00.000Z	hopelessguy	anirudh0	something happened but it went back to normal
2008-05-30T15:29:00.000Z	anirudh0	hopelessguy	it is easier to use gnome...or switch over to kwin-kde4, which imho is atleast as good..if not better than compiz
2008-05-30T15:30:00.000Z	hopelessguy	anirudh0	tried with ubuntu too. same result
2008-05-30T15:33:00.000Z	anirudh0	hopelessguy	i meant switching to kde4
2008-05-30T15:33:00.000Z	hopelessguy	anirudh0	it has bad results
