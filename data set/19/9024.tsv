2007-02-03T15:06:00.000Z	kps_		i have /dev/hda and /dev/sda
2007-02-03T15:06:00.000Z	kps_		/dev/hda is apparently (hd0)
2007-02-03T15:07:00.000Z	kps_		no, sorry i mean /dev/sda is hd0
2007-02-03T15:07:00.000Z	kps_		i have no idea what /dev/hda is
2007-02-03T15:07:00.000Z	kps_		(in grub)
2007-02-03T15:07:00.000Z	kps_		it doesn't appear in the menu.lst
2007-02-03T15:07:00.000Z	kps_		there is a normal ide disk and a sata disk
2007-02-03T15:08:00.000Z	kps_		the normal disk is /dev/hda, the sata disk /dev/sda
2007-02-03T15:08:00.000Z	kps_		but what are they in grub
2007-02-03T15:09:00.000Z	kps_		is there a way to list in grub what the devices it know of are?
2007-02-03T15:11:00.000Z	alex_mayorga	kps_	trey e to edit the commands, then try the tab key it'll tell you what grub knows
2007-02-03T15:13:00.000Z	kps_	alex_mayorga	e where?
2007-02-03T15:14:00.000Z	alex_mayorga	kps_	pres e while in grub to edit the commands
2007-02-03T15:16:00.000Z	alex_mayorga	kps_	give http://supergrub.forjamari.linex.org a whirl
2007-02-03T15:17:00.000Z	kps_	alex_mayorga	i already have grub on my master boot record, i just don't know what the devices are called in grub
2007-02-03T15:17:00.000Z	alex_mayorga	kps_	do you see a list of OS's in grub?
2007-02-03T15:18:00.000Z	kps_	alex_mayorga	well there are in the menu.lst some linux boot options
2007-02-03T15:20:00.000Z	alex_mayorga	kps_	on the OS selection of grub you can press e to edit the options, move to one of the hd places and press tab there it would tell you what it knows
2007-02-03T15:22:00.000Z	kps_	alex_mayorga	juano__ it seems like /dev/sda1 is (hd0,0) and /dev/hda is (hd1,0)
