2012-06-24T14:18:00.000Z	Zyewni		If anyone's around to answer some partitioning questions, please let me know
2012-06-24T14:18:00.000Z	ikonia	Zyewni	just ask, someone will answer if they know
2012-06-25T23:11:00.000Z	ikonia	Zyewni	you can only have 4 primary partitions
2012-06-25T23:11:00.000Z	ikonia	Zyewni	it's nothing to do with windows
2012-06-25T23:18:00.000Z	ikonia	Zyewni	what about it ?
2012-06-25T23:19:00.000Z	ikonia	Zyewni	not from the same partition
2012-06-25T23:20:00.000Z	Zyewni	ikonia	So really I'd need an entirely separate drive to install a 3rd OS?
2012-06-25T23:20:00.000Z	ikonia	Zyewni	no, just a seperate partition
2012-06-25T23:26:00.000Z	Zyewni	ikonia	here's my HD: sda1 PQSERVICE (NTFS) 20GB for Win 7; sda 2 SYSTEM RESERVED (NTFS) 100MB for Win 7; sda3 Windows 7 (NTFS) 270GB also (obviously) for Win 7; Unallocated 125GB; sda4 (50GB) contains /, /home, and linux-swap.
2012-06-25T23:27:00.000Z	ikonia	Zyewni	if you have space, sure
2012-06-25T23:28:00.000Z	Zyewni	ikonia	but if I can't run Windows 8 out of the extended partition where I have Ubuntu, where can I put it? The three primaries are all taken by Windows 7 stuff.
2012-06-25T23:28:00.000Z	ikonia	Zyewni	you'll need to move data around
2012-06-25T23:30:00.000Z	ikonia	Zyewni	no
2012-06-25T23:32:00.000Z	Zyewni	ikonia	sorry, but I just don't understand then. You say it's possible if I move data around, but I don't see what I can move around that would let me create that a new partition.
2012-06-25T23:32:00.000Z	ikonia	Zyewni	then you can't do it
2012-06-25T23:34:00.000Z	Zyewni	ikonia	could I safely put a working NTFS windows/linux share logical partition in the extended partition with Ubuntu?
2012-06-25T23:34:00.000Z	ikonia	Zyewni	don't see why not
2012-06-25T23:35:00.000Z	Zyewni	ikonia	Thanks for your help. Sorry if I was obnoxious :D
2012-06-25T23:35:00.000Z	ikonia	Zyewni	not at all
