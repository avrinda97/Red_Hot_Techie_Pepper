2005-10-05T10:44:00.000Z	houman_zhu		what? no java runtime environment? you kidding?
2005-10-05T10:44:00.000Z	houman_zhu		but why wouldnt the original be there? sun has a package for linux anywyas
2005-10-05T10:45:00.000Z	houman_zhu		is this a sun problem or the ubuntu guys havnt made a deb for ubuntu yet? whats happening, dont scare me
2005-10-05T10:47:00.000Z	dabaR	houman_zhu	see how they have the rpm, and bin for linux?
2005-10-05T10:47:00.000Z	houman_zhu	dabaR	yes ok
2005-10-05T10:47:00.000Z	dabaR	houman_zhu	that should be enough to understand the legal side...
2005-10-05T10:48:00.000Z	houman_zhu	dabaR	i dont, why wouldnt they make a deb too, i mean they want us linux people to use java based programs too right
2005-10-05T10:48:00.000Z	dabaR	houman_zhu	there is a bin, and a rpm, as I said. Linux for human beings is a new idea....
2005-10-05T10:49:00.000Z	dabaR	houman_zhu	ppl still distribute .debs for hoary, and even for breezy.
2005-10-05T10:49:00.000Z	houman_zhu	dabaR	isnt the bin distro independent?
2005-10-05T10:49:00.000Z	dabaR		thats a little stupid, tho
2005-10-05T10:49:00.000Z	dabaR	houman_zhu	yes, that is what you want for ubuntu/debian, and there is make-jpkg, so its really easy.
2005-10-05T10:50:00.000Z	dabaR	houman_zhu	then you get a .deb.
2005-10-05T10:50:00.000Z	houman_zhu	dabaR	oh ok , so there is no java crisis in the linux community, i kinda overreacted, too much coffee, thanks for your patience and explaining it to me
2005-10-05T10:51:00.000Z	houman_zhu	dabaR	this is how it was for hoary too right? nothing has really changed right?
2005-10-05T10:52:00.000Z	dabaR	houman_zhu	there has always been a make-jpkg, if that is what you are asking. There were debs in the backports, the backports became an official project, and the forums, so, the licence had to be honored, which is ok, maybe they will make a .deb soon.
2005-10-05T10:53:00.000Z	dabaR	houman_zhu	the IBM java afaik, is included in Breezy, as a package.
2005-10-05T10:53:00.000Z	dabaR	houman_zhu	there are docs at the wiki on this.
2005-10-05T10:54:00.000Z	houman_zhu	dabaR	thanks for the info, ill look through the wiki
