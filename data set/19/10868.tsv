2006-04-30T14:24:00.000Z	regeya	zC	wine is fine for a few things, but for games, there's the commercial cedega fork...more complete, at least with the gaming-related stuff...if you're using wine for games, you're playing non-free games anyway.  free as in freedom as a goal isn't just for non-games
2006-04-30T14:25:00.000Z	zC	regeya	i don't speek english i'm confused ^
2006-04-30T14:25:00.000Z	regeya		I've run into people in the forums who're complete babies if non-free software is brought up, but that also have posts about running windows games on their ubuntu boxes.  meh.

2006-04-30T14:27:00.000Z	regeya	zC	for some games, yes.  the commercial cedea wine is a better choice for games; my only point is that if you're not wanting to run cedega because it's proprietary, you're being a bit of a hypocrite...not trying to be insulting, just pointing out something :-)
2006-04-30T14:27:00.000Z	zC		Rug i understand ^^ do you know the website ?
