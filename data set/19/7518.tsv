2007-09-29T09:59:00.000Z	scguy318	CyberMad	and are the two machines hooked up to same network?
2007-09-29T10:00:00.000Z	CyberMad	scguy318	that's what i'm asked.. hehe i confuse use what method.. i tried bonjour but it doesn't support send file
2007-09-29T10:00:00.000Z	CyberMad	scguy318	all machines are in same network
2007-09-29T10:00:00.000Z	CyberMad	scguy318	there are about 50 PCs
2007-09-29T10:02:00.000Z	scguy318	CyberMad	mmm
2007-09-29T10:02:00.000Z	scguy318	CyberMad	the lazy way out would be...e-mail :P
2007-09-29T10:03:00.000Z	scguy318	CyberMad	i guess a simple SMB share?
2007-09-29T10:03:00.000Z	CyberMad	scguy318	well, i just want to deploy: chat, send file feature for all employee
2007-09-29T10:03:00.000Z	scguy318	CyberMad	ah, ok
2007-09-29T10:04:00.000Z	scguy318	CyberMad	i would imagine that setting up an XMPP server could do it
2007-09-29T10:04:00.000Z	scguy318	CyberMad	i know that protocol supports file transfer
2007-09-29T10:05:00.000Z	CyberMad	scguy318	yes, i already deploy chat server based on XMPP, but the problem is i don't add user nickname one by one on each PCs
2007-09-29T10:06:00.000Z	CyberMad	scguy318	so there is 50 PC, so i must add 50 x 50 = 250 ;(
2007-09-29T10:06:00.000Z	CyberMad	scguy318	do you know any plugin for XMPP so can automatically all nickname?
2007-09-29T10:07:00.000Z	scguy318	CyberMad	mm, I'm not sure, though I know Pidgin has a Search for Users feature
2007-10-04T10:00:00.000Z	scguy318	CyberMad	its in System -> Administration -> Network I think
