2006-06-08T08:14:00.000Z	lemsx1		hello all
2006-06-08T08:15:00.000Z	lemsx1		anybody has any idea why do Xv colors (video) go back (or how to fix them)
2006-06-08T08:15:00.000Z	lemsx1		i have two ubuntu dapper boxes side-by-side. one has good colors in videos and the other doesn't
2006-06-08T08:15:00.000Z	Ng	lemsx1	are you using totem? its preferences have a hue slider that can often compensate for strange Xv discolouration
2006-06-08T08:17:00.000Z	lemsx1	Ng	everything that uses video looks bad. totem included. i just tried Helix PLayer and Real Player
2006-06-08T08:17:00.000Z	lemsx1	Ng	changing the video output sink in multimedia preferences yields the same for SDL and No Xv
2006-06-08T08:18:00.000Z	Ng	lemsx1	hmm, that's quite strange
2006-06-08T08:18:00.000Z	lemsx1	Ng	i'm actually starting to think that the video card is bad... who knows
2006-06-08T08:18:00.000Z	Ng	lemsx1	might be worth checking that X is running in enough colours
2006-06-08T08:18:00.000Z	lemsx1	Ng	yep. X does run with millions of colors at 1280x1024 (LCD display)
2006-06-08T08:19:00.000Z	Ng	lemsx1	I'm not sure then, sorry
2006-06-08T08:19:00.000Z	lemsx1	Ng	both computers use the same display setting. the same monitor plug to both. etc... but, the computers themselves are different. one is HP other IBM
2006-06-08T08:19:00.000Z	lemsx1	Ng	no problem. is just weird
2006-06-08T08:19:00.000Z	Ng	lemsx1	do you have a spare graphics card you could test with?
2006-06-08T08:20:00.000Z	lemsx1	Ng	this box only takes PCI cards and i have no card at this moment
2006-06-08T08:21:00.000Z	lemsx1	Ng	i was wondering if there is anything from gconf or some obscure setting somewhere...
2006-06-08T08:21:00.000Z	Ng	lemsx1	not as far as i know
2006-06-08T08:21:00.000Z	lemsx1	Ng	xvinfo is no help either
2006-06-08T08:22:00.000Z	lemsx1	Ng	it shows the same output for both systems
