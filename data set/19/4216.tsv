2010-03-13T13:50:00.000Z	ZykoticK9		how could I find out what device (ie /dev/ttyS1, /dev/cua0, etc) my bluetooth USB adapter uses?
2010-03-13T13:50:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	ZykoticK9	usually info would be in via dmesg
2010-03-13T13:51:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	psycho_oreos	dmesg shows next to nothing.  lsusb will show the device name, but nothing more.
2010-03-13T13:51:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	ZykoticK9	when was the dongle plugged in? before/during or after bootup?
2010-03-13T13:52:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	psycho_oreos	right now - dmesg only shows "usb 4-2: new full speed USB device using ohci_hcd and address 3" & "usb 4-2: configuration #1 chosen from 1 choice" when it's plugged in
2010-03-13T13:53:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	ZykoticK9	it might be missing driver/firmware
2010-03-13T13:53:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	psycho_oreos	oh it works fine - i just need the info to try and get Wammu working
2010-03-13T13:53:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	ZykoticK9	pastebin your lsusb

2010-03-13T13:56:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	ZykoticK9	which version of ubuntu are you using?
2010-03-13T13:56:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	psycho_oreos	the version that can't be mentioned in this channel
2010-03-13T13:57:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	ZykoticK9	ah ha, because you don't have support in that channel or?
2010-03-13T13:57:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	psycho_oreos	Lucid
2010-03-13T13:57:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	ZykoticK9	yeah I've figured that out, but what you've tried their channels with no answer?
2010-03-13T13:59:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	ZykoticK9	have you actually given it a go with karmic or jackalope instead of heading towards lucid?
2010-03-13T13:59:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	psycho_oreos	it's all good man, thanks for trying :)
2010-03-13T13:59:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	ZykoticK9	k
2010-12-28T07:21:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	psycho_oreos	actually the firewall isn't turned on in Ubuntu by default
2010-12-28T07:21:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	ZykoticK9	more like what I thought as not configured, i.e. nothing on the rules table
