2007-05-16T10:59:00.000Z	sipior	eazel7	why so long a message length?
2007-05-16T11:01:00.000Z	sipior	eazel7	i'm guessing it doesn't like the fact that you would guarantee packet fragmentation with that size
2007-05-16T11:01:00.000Z	sipior	eazel7	pastebin your ifconfig, and we'll have a look
2007-05-16T11:02:00.000Z	sipior	eazel7	also, have you changed the MTU for the interface at all?
2007-05-16T11:03:00.000Z	sipior	eazel7	odd, it doesn't claim any dropped packets
2007-05-16T11:03:00.000Z	sipior	eazel7	could the problem be further down your network? what's your setup like?
2007-05-16T11:04:00.000Z	sipior	eazel7	and that netmask is correct? not flat 255.255.255.0?
2007-05-16T11:05:00.000Z	eazel7	sipior	yes, it's 255.255.252.0 here
2007-05-16T11:05:00.000Z	sipior	eazel7	do you have another computer on the switch, and does it have problems?
2007-05-16T11:06:00.000Z	sipior	eazel7	thank you, that narrows things a bit :-)
2007-05-16T11:07:00.000Z	sipior	eazel7	what sort of card, btw?
2007-05-16T11:08:00.000Z	sipior	eazel7	well, lots of those cards. which maker? also, you might consider disabling ipv6, it might be causing issues
2007-05-16T11:08:00.000Z	eazel7	sipior	I don't know how to disable it
2007-05-16T11:09:00.000Z	sipior	eazel7	google "disable ipv6 ubuntu" and i'll bet you'll find something :)
2007-05-16T11:11:00.000Z	sipior	eazel7	have a look here: https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+question/5177
2007-05-16T11:13:00.000Z	sipior	eazel7	have a look at the link i pasted above re: disabling ipv6 in ubuntu
2007-05-16T11:22:00.000Z	sipior	eazel7	hmm...this is difficult to diagnose remotely, i'm afraid
2007-05-16T11:22:00.000Z	sipior	eazel7	so, downloads are slow, or simply fail above a certain size?
2007-05-16T11:23:00.000Z	sipior	eazel7	i've checked the card and it's certainly supported under linux. another thing to try would be rebooting with the live installer CD and see if the network is fine in that case.
