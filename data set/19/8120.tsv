2007-06-11T08:15:00.000Z	Sakura	Memories	That sounds like a server error. Considering it's hotmail... how often did you try?
2007-06-11T08:16:00.000Z	Sakura	Memories	You can try 3 times, then log on once using the web... >.<
2007-06-11T08:17:00.000Z	Memories	Sakura	though am wondering how should i fix tht issue!
2007-06-11T08:18:00.000Z	Sakura	Memories	have you tried to use telnet to log on to hotmail? It's pop3 isn't it?
2007-06-11T08:19:00.000Z	Memories	Sakura	a premium hotmail is allowed to use microsoft outlook to connect to hotmail among other features
2007-06-11T08:21:00.000Z	Sakura	Memories	Outlook is not an Ubuntu certified application :))
2007-06-11T08:22:00.000Z	Sakura	Memories	Please PM (personal message which I have sent you)
2007-06-11T08:24:00.000Z	Sakura	Memories	Sorry I was trying to direct you how to use telnet to connect to hotmail pop3 if possible because this way you can read all error messages clear text
2007-06-11T08:24:00.000Z	Memories	Sakura	dont b sorry! though i think am ignored over ur irc client!
2007-06-11T08:25:00.000Z	Sakura	Memories	You're right I'm wrong. Although I have an out-of.the-box XChat here
