2007-07-27T08:24:00.000Z	Some_Person		Is there any way I can see a list of most recently installed packages?
2007-07-27T08:24:00.000Z	mrsno	Some_Person	yes you can view the log in /var/log/dpkg or /var/log/synaptic iirc
2007-07-27T08:26:00.000Z	Some_Person	mrsno	those files don't exist
2007-07-27T08:26:00.000Z	mrsno	Some_Person	sorry im not 100% sure off the top of my head, but maybe its /var/log/aptitude
2007-07-27T08:27:00.000Z	Some_Person	mrsno	again, doesn't exist
2007-07-27T08:27:00.000Z	mrsno	Some_Person	2 ticks, let me check in my virtual machine :)
2007-07-27T08:28:00.000Z	Some_Person	mrsno	thank you
2007-07-27T08:30:00.000Z	mrsno	Some_Person	i have /var/log/aptitude and /var/log/dpkg.log here
2007-07-27T08:31:00.000Z	Some_Person	mrsno	i have the 2nd one, thank you
2007-07-27T08:32:00.000Z	mrsno		your welcome
2007-07-27T08:32:00.000Z	mrsno	Some_Person	if you install files through apt-get or synaptic, then it will write to dpkg.log (they all use dpkg to install files)
2007-07-27T08:32:00.000Z	Some_Person	mrsno	what about from source code?
2007-07-27T08:32:00.000Z	mrsno		aptitude is another tool and i think it writes to dpkg.log as well, as well as /var/log/aptitude so if you haven't used aptitude, that would explain it
2007-07-27T08:33:00.000Z	mrsno	Some_Person	depends how you installed from source code, did you create a .deb file and thus install with dpkg?
2007-07-27T08:33:00.000Z	Some_Person	mrsno	no, it wouldn't let me
2007-07-27T08:34:00.000Z	mrsno	Some_Person	then unfortunately the log files mentioned will have no record of installing those packages, as you must have manually make/make install'd them
2007-07-27T08:34:00.000Z	Some_Person	mrsno	oh well
2007-07-27T08:34:00.000Z	mrsno	Some_Person	you could check "history" to see your terminal commands and check from that
2007-07-27T08:34:00.000Z	Some_Person	mrsno	ok
