2010-03-13T09:58:00.000Z	pfifo	greezmunkey	see if gimp has any plugins
2010-03-13T09:58:00.000Z	pfifo	greezmunkey	imagemajick too
2010-03-13T09:58:00.000Z	greezmunkey	pfifo	I hadn't thought of that! :)
2010-03-13T10:00:00.000Z	greezmunkey	pfifo	I'll check both, thanks! I have to modify a website that was created by splitting images :(
2010-03-13T10:00:00.000Z	pfifo	greezmunkey	also your probbally using nautilus, other 'explorer like' programs may give different details
2010-03-13T10:03:00.000Z	greezmunkey	pfifo	Yes, if I right click a file, select properties, then choose the image tab, it gives the info I want. My issue is that I have to weed through 250 some images!

2010-03-13T10:05:00.000Z	greezmunkey	pfifo	I guess I'm old school...I've not run across a web page built this way before until today! Seems like a "cheater" way to do things. Makes maintenance a b----.
