2007-03-02T10:18:00.000Z	rpc		is there a way to run a custom kernel that i just installed if it's compiled without initrd? grub tries to run initrd by default and it all fails
2007-03-02T10:18:00.000Z	eck	rpc	just don't add an initrd line
2007-03-02T10:19:00.000Z	rpc	eck	i didn't
2007-03-02T10:19:00.000Z	eck	rpc	also check to make sure kopts is not set
2007-03-02T10:19:00.000Z	rpc	eck	and it says about missing root etc. (kernel panic)
2007-03-02T10:19:00.000Z	eck	rpc	you need a root= line
2007-03-02T10:19:00.000Z	rpc	eck	i have one
2007-03-02T10:19:00.000Z	rpc	eck	it's pointing to the same device as in the previous kernel
2007-03-02T10:19:00.000Z	eck	rpc	you might be missing the driver your your hard drive
2007-03-02T10:20:00.000Z	rpc	eck	it's a sata device - i didn't really see antything for sata in config
2007-03-02T10:20:00.000Z	eck	rpc	what kernel?
2007-03-02T10:21:00.000Z	rpc	eck	2.6.20.1
2007-03-02T10:21:00.000Z	eck	rpc	i think it is folded in with the scsi stuff in 2.6.20
2007-03-02T10:21:00.000Z	rpc	eck	oh
2007-03-02T10:21:00.000Z	rpc	eck	ok looks like i need to start from scratch then :/ thank you
2007-03-02T10:21:00.000Z	rpc	eck	but don't you think it has to do with missing initrd image?
2007-03-02T10:22:00.000Z	rpc	eck	even though there is no initrd line for that kernel in grub
2007-03-02T10:22:00.000Z	eck	rpc	you do not need an initrd
2007-03-02T10:22:00.000Z	rpc	eck	ok thank you
