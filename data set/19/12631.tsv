2005-12-27T10:03:00.000Z	eps		breezy is still broken in my opinion
2005-12-27T10:03:00.000Z	eps		ffs no debian release would give you a gcc update and no kernel to go with it :P
2005-12-27T10:04:00.000Z	trappist	eps	oh but they would.
2005-12-27T10:04:00.000Z	trappist	eps	my big frustration with my last debian install is that the gcc version that built the distributed kernel wasn't even available
2005-12-27T10:07:00.000Z	trappist	eps	you probably have 3.4 installed too.  it's not a big deal.  export CC or update your symlinks or use update-alternatives.
2005-12-27T10:20:00.000Z	trappist	eps	export CC=/usr/bin/gcc-3.4
2005-12-27T10:21:00.000Z	trappist	eps	you're just trolling now.  you have two different compilers, and it defaults to the newer, shinier one, and you're complaining?
2005-12-27T10:21:00.000Z	eps	trappist	yes, there shouldn't be a lag between a new gcc and a kernel built under it in a stable distro
2005-12-27T10:21:00.000Z	trappist	eps	tell her to apt-get install the nvidia drivers.
2005-12-27T10:22:00.000Z	trappist	eps	why is that, exactly?  I don't know that the new compiler's been out long enough to trust kernels built with it.
2005-12-27T10:23:00.000Z	eps	trappist	it works like this, apply the default updates, try to compile a kernel module (vmware...some thing my father would try and install) and find out...oh wait! no kernels with it!
2006-01-03T08:54:00.000Z	trappist	eps	that's not a downside.  distros (except gentoo) tend not to release the all the newest, shiniest software into stable versions of the distro, because that would make it unstable.
2006-01-03T08:54:00.000Z	eps	trappist	thanks for the useless information :)
2006-01-03T08:54:00.000Z	trappist	eps	wtf.
2006-01-03T08:55:00.000Z	eps	trappist	I was commenting to uber_spaced noting that there is a delay in package updates to versions
2006-01-03T08:56:00.000Z	eps	trappist	also that isn't correct anyway, many distros release 'up to the minute' packages - gentoo even trials behind ubuntu in some areas. it is up to the package maintainers.  but I'm sure that is useless info to you as well?
2006-01-03T08:58:00.000Z	trappist	eps	I'm not gonna argue about why we don't have firefox1.5, why kde3.5 is in a completely separate repository, why there exists a backports repository, etc.  you're just being an asshole.
2006-01-03T08:58:00.000Z	eps	trappist	lay off please
2006-02-25T11:14:00.000Z	eps	trappist	if you don't want me to be an arsehole try this: pay me.  I only take rubbish from end users like you when I'm being paid for it, get some manors and realise the community supports you out of their own time and resources.
