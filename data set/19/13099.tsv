2005-11-17T16:22:00.000Z	antix		how do I take an image of a lvm partition?  it should preferebly be compressed
2005-11-17T16:24:00.000Z	antix		what do you ppl use for backup of your systems?
2005-11-17T16:24:00.000Z	cafuego_	antix	rsync and a duplicate server
2005-11-17T16:24:00.000Z	antix	cafuego_	no image?
2005-11-17T16:26:00.000Z	antix	cafuego_	do you have a duplicate server which is used just for that?
2005-11-17T16:27:00.000Z	cafuego_	antix	No, it's used for something else, but I can reboot it as lukewarm-spare
2005-11-17T16:28:00.000Z	antix	cafuego_	but you must also take some backup so you can go back in time to a point where the system was ok? else you will just have 2 bad systems?
2005-11-17T16:29:00.000Z	cafuego_	antix	Yeah, just a few DVDs
2005-11-17T16:30:00.000Z	antix	cafuego_	what do you use for making the dvd backup?
2005-11-17T16:30:00.000Z	cafuego_	antix	Of course, the initial system is raided, so passing an actual fire not much can go wrong.
2005-11-17T16:30:00.000Z	cafuego_	antix	I burn 'em in gnome.
2005-11-17T16:30:00.000Z	antix	cafuego_	so ppl don't take images? :)
2005-11-17T16:31:00.000Z	antix	cafuego_	I would think it's easier to restore?
2005-11-17T16:31:00.000Z	cafuego_	antix	For a desktop, there's 'sbackup' that goes into your admin menu.
2005-11-17T16:31:00.000Z	cafuego_	antix	It's a remote box, it would be pointless.
2005-11-17T16:31:00.000Z	antix	cafuego_	ok it's a server I need backedup
2005-11-17T16:32:00.000Z	antix	cafuego_	ok in that case :)
2005-11-17T16:32:00.000Z	cafuego_	antix	If it dies, I tell the hoster to trash it, reinstall it, give me an ssh passwd. Then I re-add the /etc and 'dpkg --get-selections' status :-)
2005-11-17T16:33:00.000Z	antix	cafuego_	ok but there's always a lot of tweaking that you would have to do again I guess. but most is in /etc I guess so you might be ok with that
