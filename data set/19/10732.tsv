2006-10-26T11:21:00.000Z	crass		the network manager always tells me that there is no netowrk connection for wireless, does anyone else get this?
2006-10-26T11:21:00.000Z	sivik	crass	my wireless never works
2006-10-26T11:21:00.000Z	crass	sivik	I've gotten wireless to work fine, but not with network manager
2006-10-26T11:21:00.000Z	sivik	crass	that must be nice
2006-10-26T11:22:00.000Z	crass	sivik	you need some help?
2006-10-26T11:22:00.000Z	sivik	crass	its broadcom
2006-10-26T11:23:00.000Z	crass	sivik	do you have the kernel drivers for it>
2006-10-26T11:24:00.000Z	sivik	crass	yes, its natavely installed in anything later than 2.6.15 (ubuntu) and i have the newest firmware, but it never picks up wireless connections avaliable
2006-10-26T11:25:00.000Z	crass	sivik	have you done iwlist <iface> --scan in the presense of a network?
2006-10-26T11:25:00.000Z	sivik	crass	yes
2006-10-26T11:26:00.000Z	sivik	crass	it never picks up crap
2006-10-26T11:26:00.000Z	sivik	crass	and the wireless is sitting like 18 inches from me
2006-10-26T11:26:00.000Z	crass	sivik	are you sure its not a driver issue?
2006-10-26T11:26:00.000Z	sivik	crass	yes i know, the driver is integrated in the kernel already
2006-10-26T11:27:00.000Z	crass	sivik	just because its in the kernel doesn't mean it works with your model
2006-10-26T11:27:00.000Z	sivik	crass	well, i have to download the firmware and put it in the /lib/firmware and the guys that made the bloody driver say it works for my card
2006-10-26T11:28:00.000Z	sivik	crass	its a bcm4318
2006-10-26T11:28:00.000Z	crass	sivik	deos dmesg say anything about it?
2006-10-26T11:28:00.000Z	sivik	crass	the only time it works, is when i do a fresh install of dapper, but as soon as i either update packages or dist-upgrade, it never works again
