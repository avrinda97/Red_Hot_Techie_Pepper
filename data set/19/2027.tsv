2010-07-25T13:25:00.000Z	noboot		hi, i updated ubuntu and now it wont boot. i got a suggestion to reinstall grub from livecd. i am now trying this.. but when i do sudo grub-install ..(args here),  i get a warning: warn: "Attempting to install GRUB to a partition instead of the MBR.  This is a BAD idea.."
2010-07-25T13:25:00.000Z	noboot		should i continue anyway?
2010-07-25T13:25:00.000Z	noboot		/usr/sbin/grub-setup: warn: Embedding is not possible.  GRUB can only be installed in this setup by using blocklists.  However, blocklists are UNRELIABLE and its use is discouraged..
