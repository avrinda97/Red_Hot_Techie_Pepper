2007-10-09T06:15:00.000Z	fevel	LjL	is there any other way I could get it, I really eed it
2007-10-09T06:15:00.000Z	LjL	fevel	i don't see it being available in the repos
2007-10-09T06:16:00.000Z	LjL	fevel	no idea, i wouldn't touch skype with a ten foot pole either :)
2007-10-09T06:17:00.000Z	fevel	LjL	how would you voice on 64 bits with skype users then?
2007-10-09T06:18:00.000Z	LjL	fevel	i wouldn't, i'd convince them to avoid such proprietary protocols that force people on certain system, and use common, standard stuff like SIP instead, which has a client (usually more than one) available for just about every operating system ever made.
2007-10-09T06:18:00.000Z	fevel	LjL	oh thats a good one...ill give you 10 bucks if you convince my boss
2007-10-09T06:21:00.000Z	fevel	LjL	ok you did convince me though... Do you know a good alternative?
2007-10-09T06:21:00.000Z	LjL	fevel	you could tell him that SIP is what is used by the real phone companies (it's not a lie), and that being an open protocol, it's possible to encrypt communication if sensitive communication is to occur. you could tell him that it's possible to do multi-user conferencing, and there are also many companies providing SIP to PSTN gateways, some giving you a free local PSTN number you can even conference on for no fee.
2007-10-09T06:22:00.000Z	fevel	LjL	s SIP a client
2007-10-09T06:22:00.000Z	LjL	fevel	on GNOME, the best-known SIP client is Ekiga. Twinkle is a KDE client with quite a few features.
2007-10-09T06:22:00.000Z	fevel	LjL	what would he install on windows? any idea?
2007-10-09T06:24:00.000Z	LjL	fevel	ttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_SIP_software#SIP_clients  http://www.voip-info.org/wiki-Open+Source+VOIP+Software  here's a couple of lists of clients. on Windows, i think EyeBeam is pretty good, and another whose name escapes me - but neither are free software. i'm sure there are also lots of free ones, though
2007-10-09T06:25:00.000Z	LjL	fevel	SJPhone was the one i was thinking about.
2007-10-09T06:29:00.000Z	fevel	LjL	its free and for windows?? ill take a look
2007-10-09T06:30:00.000Z	LjL	fevel	no, it's not free, both eyebeam and sjphone are proprietary - although there are "freeware" versions (with ads in the case of sjphone). look at those list for really free clients - i'm not very familiar with windows ones, for obvious reasons, but there are a few
2007-10-29T18:01:00.000Z	LjL	fevel	by copying everything there.
2007-10-29T18:02:00.000Z	LjL	fevel	uh?
