2009-12-01T09:44:00.000Z	Billiard	ten80p	how are you trying to mount it
2009-12-01T09:44:00.000Z	ten80p	Billiard	I tried sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /media/DiskB
2009-12-01T09:46:00.000Z	Billiard	ten80p	how is sdb1 formatted, what fs type, you may need to specify it
2009-12-01T09:48:00.000Z	Billiard	ten80p	try adding -t ext3 to your mount command
2009-12-01T09:48:00.000Z	ten80p	Billiard	alrdy did, still says wrong fs
2009-12-01T09:48:00.000Z	Billiard	ten80p	did you format it?
2009-12-01T09:48:00.000Z	Billiard	ten80p	did you try without the -t option
2009-12-01T09:48:00.000Z	Billiard	ten80p	you need to format it before you mount it
2009-12-01T09:50:00.000Z	Billiard	ten80p	is there maybe conflicting line in the fstab?
2009-12-01T09:51:00.000Z	ten80p	Billiard	dont think so, fstab says the filesystem is the one i chose
2009-12-01T09:51:00.000Z	Billiard	ten80p	try removing the fstab line, and try to mount without specifying a fstype
2009-12-01T09:51:00.000Z	Billiard	ten80p	sudo blkid     might tell you the fstype
2009-12-01T09:52:00.000Z	ten80p	Billiard	mount: you must specify the filesystem type
2009-12-01T09:53:00.000Z	Billiard	ten80p	try sudo blkid
2009-12-01T09:53:00.000Z	ten80p	Billiard	blkid only showed the main hard drive not sdb
2009-12-01T09:53:00.000Z	Billiard	ten80p	even with sudo ?
2009-12-01T09:55:00.000Z	Billiard	ten80p	is it possible the filesystem is corrupted? could try fsck
2009-12-01T09:56:00.000Z	ten80p	Billiard	checking now, does seem to have errors!
