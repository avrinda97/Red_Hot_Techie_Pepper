2008-03-01T14:12:00.000Z	Arelis		Hi all. I'm in Ubuntu on a pendrive now but i can't log in to the graphical part of Ubuntu, it says that .ICEauthority is not accesible. I tried changing the permissions on it but it didn't help
2008-03-01T14:12:00.000Z	Arelis		how do i fix that?
2008-03-01T14:13:00.000Z	Jayzer	Arelis	don't repeat your question like that
2008-03-01T14:13:00.000Z	Arelis	Jayzer	sorry, had to change names
2008-03-01T14:14:00.000Z	Arelis	Jayzer	Sure. it's --rw------ <-- Strange, the permissions haven't changed
2008-03-01T14:16:00.000Z	Arelis	Jayzer	I tried again. I see, every time i log into gnome, it makes it only user-read-writeable. Whatever permissions i set on it, gnome ruins it.
2008-03-01T14:16:00.000Z	Arelis	Jayzer	"chmod 777 .ICEauthority"
2008-03-01T14:18:00.000Z	Arelis	Jayzer	ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ ls -al .ICEauthority
2008-03-01T14:19:00.000Z	Arelis	Jayzer	can you help me further?
2008-03-01T14:22:00.000Z	Arelis	Jayzer	sure
2008-03-01T14:24:00.000Z	Arelis	Jayzer	Already did. Changes the permissions to user rw
2008-03-01T14:28:00.000Z	Jayzer	Arelis	so it just knocks you out of X and gives you that error message?
2008-03-01T14:29:00.000Z	Arelis	Jayzer	Deleting .ICEauthority fixed it!
2008-03-01T14:30:00.000Z	Arelis	Jayzer	now i just need to add that to a startup script so it deletes it every time it boots
2008-03-01T14:31:00.000Z	Arelis	Jayzer	no.
2008-03-01T14:31:00.000Z	Arelis	Jayzer	will .bashrc be run when i login using the display manager?
2008-03-01T14:32:00.000Z	Jayzer	Arelis	don't believe so
2008-03-01T14:33:00.000Z	Arelis	Jayzer	so that means when the system boots? (every time it boots, it logs into the shell)
