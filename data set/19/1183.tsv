2011-04-29T16:58:00.000Z	Skei		Morning, all. I have a discrete NVIDIA video card which works well under 10.10, but there's also an integrated Intel card that Ubuntu isn't recognising / detecting. Any pointers for getting this installed ?
2011-04-29T16:58:00.000Z	Incarus6	Skei	can you paste "dmesg"?
2011-04-29T17:00:00.000Z	Skei	Incarus6	it's about 750 lines, sorry : http://pastebin.com/6kLDH0Gj
2011-04-29T17:02:00.000Z	Incarus6	Skei	I think Intel Sany Bridge isn't yet fully supported in the linux kernel
2011-04-29T17:03:00.000Z	Incarus6	Skei	line 711 "[   12.440031] agpgart-intel 0000:00:00.0: Intel Sandybridge Chipset"
2011-04-29T17:07:00.000Z	Skei	Incarus6	yes, it's a 1155 socket. So the graphics adaptor isn't supported ?
2011-04-29T17:10:00.000Z	Incarus6	Skei	according to some websites the sandy bridge should be supported, but mention that some hardware and some features aren't supported yet ( http://phoronix.com/forums/showthread.php?29110-Intel-s-Linux-Sandy-Bridge-Graphics-Still-Troubling )
2011-04-29T17:11:00.000Z	Skei	Incarus6	I was just reading that one, yes. So... I won't be able to get the graphics working at all ?
2011-04-29T17:12:00.000Z	Skei	Incarus6	apparently, the latest Ubuntu has alpha support for Sandy Bridge. Yay. :P
2011-04-29T17:12:00.000Z	Incarus6	Skei	not yet, IMO. It could work with the next kernel 2.6.39 or the mainline kernel, Im not sure if something changed in this kernel
2011-04-29T17:12:00.000Z	Skei	Incarus6	I misread that. The latest alpha Ubuntu release has support for it. The release is no longer in alpha, but full stable. I might have a chance if I upgrade my distro.
2011-04-29T17:13:00.000Z	Incarus6	Skei	oh, you didn't said that you are using 10.10.. I thought you use 11.04 because this channel now supports 11.04. Yes, there is a high chance, that it will work
2011-04-29T17:14:00.000Z	Skei	Incarus6	thanks. I've tried upgrading to 11.04 recently, but it failed. I'll try again. Something about a network error...
2011-04-29T17:15:00.000Z	Incarus6	Skei	failed for me to, I had to downgrade some ( a lot of) packages, that the dependencies matched
2011-04-29T17:15:00.000Z	Skei	Incarus6	that's a major pain...
2011-04-29T17:16:00.000Z	Incarus6	Skei	it was my fault, I installed foreign package repos ;)
2011-04-29T17:16:00.000Z	Skei	Incarus6	I haven't touched repositories on this install.
2011-04-29T17:22:00.000Z	Incarus6	Skei	I hope the upgrade is solving your problem
2011-04-29T17:22:00.000Z	Skei	Incarus6	selected another server and will try it now. Will let you know.
