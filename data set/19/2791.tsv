2010-09-04T22:36:00.000Z	pat|nG		what's the command to change directory?
2010-09-04T22:37:00.000Z	BrianE	pat|nG	"cd"
2010-09-04T22:59:00.000Z	BrianE	pat|nG	It's not confusing, you're making it so ;O
2010-09-04T23:00:00.000Z	pat|nG	BrianE	mate sorry but i'm not as good as u bare with it ;)
2010-09-04T23:00:00.000Z	BrianE	pat|nG	It's not an ego-trip, I'm just trying to save you from storming off thinking Ubuntu is convoluted and hard-to-use
2010-09-04T23:01:00.000Z	BrianE	pat|nG	Open a terminal and run "sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jre"... after a while, you'll have to agree to some license terms. Accept them, and then when it's finished installing, you'll have Java working
2010-09-04T23:01:00.000Z	pat|nG	BrianE	mate...we're different individuals.....u maybe gifted were i am not...so as what i have said.....bare with it....
2010-09-04T23:02:00.000Z	BrianE	pat|nG	I'm not being mean, I'm trying to help o_O
2010-09-04T23:08:00.000Z	BrianE	pat|nG	Try TeaRex' last command - that's where it should have installed to
2010-09-04T23:10:00.000Z	BrianE	pat|nG	Try closing your terminal and opening a new one, then "java -version"... does that give the same output?
2010-09-04T23:12:00.000Z	BrianE	pat|nG	What are you trying to achieve overall?
2010-09-04T23:17:00.000Z	BrianE	pat|nG	What's the output of "ls microemulator.jar"?
2010-09-04T23:18:00.000Z	BrianE	pat|nG	There is no "microemulator.jar" file there...
2010-09-04T23:22:00.000Z	BrianE	pat|nG	Run "unzip microemulator-2.0.4.zip", then "cd microemulator-2.0.4"
2010-09-04T23:27:00.000Z	BrianE	pat|nG	Along with the "cd microemulator-2.0.4"?
2010-09-04T23:29:00.000Z	BrianE	pat|nG	;)
2010-09-04T23:38:00.000Z	BrianE	pat|nG	Could you include the "http://" of those links? Makes it easier to click
2010-09-04T23:41:00.000Z	BrianE	pat|nG	Could you not have pasted the actual link in here?
2010-09-04T23:43:00.000Z	BrianE	pat|nG	It's alright, I got it :P
