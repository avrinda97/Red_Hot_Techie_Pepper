2010-08-04T06:31:00.000Z	tensorpudding		If you know that your machine can run a 64-bit OS, and you don't mind that you have to use a half-way solution with Adobe Flash, I don't see any downsides.
2010-08-04T06:32:00.000Z	tensorpudding		Yeah, there are some projects that depend on i386 assembly code that haven't been updated in years that won't work.
2010-08-04T06:32:00.000Z	tensorpudding		ZSNES is one
2010-08-04T06:33:00.000Z	tensorpudding		but in any case, if a script designed for sh can't use dash, it is probably violating POSIX
2010-08-04T06:33:00.000Z	tensorpudding		and should be called using bash explicitly
2010-08-04T06:35:00.000Z	tensorpudding		in the script
2010-08-04T06:36:00.000Z	tensorpudding		why do you think it doesn't work with dash anyway?
2010-08-04T06:37:00.000Z	tensorpudding		the symlink of /bin/sh to dash is done by dash
2010-08-04T06:37:00.000Z	tensorpudding		you can rm /bin/sh, then ln -s /bin/bash /bin/sh
2010-08-04T06:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	tensorpudding	 bad programing on their part from what ive seen with bash/dash isshds
2010-08-04T06:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	tensorpudding	 that 'dpkg-reconfigure' or update alternatives is the proper way to change the default system shell from dash to bash
2010-08-04T06:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	tensorpudding	 ive seen some scripts also call 'sh  wjhatever' later in the script THAT can also cause issues
2010-08-04T06:39:00.000Z	tensorpudding	Dr_Willis	it's still the programmer's fault
2010-08-04T06:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	tensorpudding	 Yes.. i agree
2010-08-04T06:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	tensorpudding	 bad programing on theior part
2010-08-04T06:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	tensorpudding	 the isssue for years has been that 'bash' called as 'sh' has not been flagging a error/warning when people use non-sh 'features'
2010-08-04T06:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	tensorpudding	 many years of bad habbits.. that came to light when ubuntu decided to use dash instead of bash for sh a few years back. and there was MUCH flamfesting going on about it back then
2010-10-30T02:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	tensorpudding	 depends on the filesystem i belive.
2011-04-02T18:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	tensorpudding	 these days. not a whole lot. for most people.
