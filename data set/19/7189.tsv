2008-02-26T13:55:00.000Z	nocturn		Hi all
2008-02-26T13:56:00.000Z	nocturn		I would like to put my /home/$user in an encrypted home
2008-02-26T13:56:00.000Z	nocturn		most howto's deal with encrypted partitions, how would I go about this?
2008-02-26T13:56:00.000Z	nocturn		I meant in an encrypted image
2008-02-26T13:57:00.000Z	bazhang	nocturn	have you considered truecrypt
2008-02-26T13:57:00.000Z	nocturn	bazhang	yes, but I'm read about truecrypt breaking on upgrades
2008-02-26T13:57:00.000Z	bazhang	nocturn	what else did you have in mind for that then
2008-02-26T14:46:00.000Z	bazhang	nocturn	right
2008-04-22T11:43:00.000Z	bazhang	nocturn	then install it--what java do you need
2008-04-22T11:44:00.000Z	nocturn	bazhang	any will do I guess.  I installed java and the java-plugin, but it only appears in FireFox 3, while this site will not work on anything but FF2
2008-04-22T11:45:00.000Z	bazhang	nocturn	this is the flash? java applet or what please specify
2008-04-22T11:46:00.000Z	nocturn	bazhang	just the normal java plugin to run applets, I need to connect to a cisco vpn server that downloads an applet to make the connection...
2008-04-22T11:47:00.000Z	bazhang	nocturn	can you copy the plugin from the ff3 plugins folder to the ff2 one? this is hardy correct?
2008-04-22T11:48:00.000Z	nocturn	bazhang	I tried, copied it to /usr/lib/firefox/plugins/ but it won't appear...
2008-04-22T11:48:00.000Z	nocturn	bazhang	Hardy RC, yes
2008-04-22T11:48:00.000Z	bazhang	nocturn	I believe the plugins location changed, you may wish to ask in the hardy channel as I have forgotten
2008-04-22T11:50:00.000Z	nocturn	bazhang	What's the channel for Hardy?
2008-04-22T11:51:00.000Z	nocturn	bazhang	thanks a million
2008-04-22T11:51:00.000Z	bazhang	nocturn	think it changed to /.mozilla
