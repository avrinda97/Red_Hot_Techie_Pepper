2006-03-22T13:10:00.000Z	pome		guys, I'm trying to apt-get plone, any tips?
2006-03-22T13:10:00.000Z	pome		it's not working
2006-03-22T13:12:00.000Z	HappyFool	pome	i played with plone for a little while; I may be remembering incorrectly, but I think the plone-site was useful to get going with plone
2006-03-22T13:12:00.000Z	HappyFool	pome	that is, the plone-site package
2006-03-22T13:12:00.000Z	pome	HappyFool	yes, i tried that too
2006-03-22T13:16:00.000Z	pome	HappyFool	plone-site worked this time, but when I try /manage, it rejects the user and pass I set it up with
2006-03-22T13:16:00.000Z	pome	HappyFool	any idea what the default might be?
2006-03-22T13:18:00.000Z	HappyFool	pome	sorry, not sure
2006-03-22T13:18:00.000Z	HappyFool	pome	looked in /usr/share/doc/plone-site* ?
2006-03-22T13:18:00.000Z	pome	HappyFool	I'll give it a whirl
2006-03-22T13:20:00.000Z	pome	HappyFool	nothing there, but I figured it out
2006-03-22T13:20:00.000Z	pome	HappyFool	despite using a different username, it accepts 'admin' and my chosen password
2006-03-22T13:21:00.000Z	pome	HappyFool	which gets me in the ZMI - there is no plone instance
2006-03-22T13:21:00.000Z	HappyFool	pome	you're already way beyond me, sorry
2006-03-22T13:22:00.000Z	pome	HappyFool	problem sorted. Thanks for your input.
2006-03-22T13:22:00.000Z	HappyFool	pome	i see a #plone and a #zope -- maybe they can give better assistance ?
2006-03-22T13:22:00.000Z	pome	HappyFool	thanks to you, I don't need them
2006-03-22T13:22:00.000Z	pome	HappyFool	(they can be a bit difficult)
2006-03-22T13:22:00.000Z	HappyFool	pome	heh. ok :)
