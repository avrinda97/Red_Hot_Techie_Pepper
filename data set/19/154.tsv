2012-08-06T09:20:00.000Z	mrgenixu1		i'd like to install nvidia-96 (I have an mx440) but there is a blocking package I don't recognize
2012-08-06T09:21:00.000Z	mrgenixu1		xorg-video-abi-10 is the blocking package
2012-08-06T09:21:00.000Z	mrgenixu1		it seems xorg-video-abi-10 is unavailable
2012-08-06T09:23:00.000Z	mrgenixu1		so, the package doesn't exist? -> I can't have nvidia-96 because it depends on non-existent packages?
2012-08-06T09:24:00.000Z	theadmin	mrgenixu1	Do you have the restricted repo enabled?
2012-08-06T09:25:00.000Z	mrgenixu1	theadmin	how do I check for restricted repos
2012-08-06T09:25:00.000Z	theadmin	mrgenixu1	You normally just install "nvidia-current" to get NVidia stuff running.
2012-08-06T09:25:00.000Z	theadmin	mrgenixu1	Specific versions may depend on stuff that's already missing...
2012-08-06T09:25:00.000Z	theadmin	mrgenixu1	Hm...
2012-08-06T09:26:00.000Z	mrgenixu1	theadmin	but how do I check for the restricted repo?
2012-08-06T09:26:00.000Z	theadmin	mrgenixu1	Never mind. I have the same issue, I have all the repos enabled. Seems your only option is to contact the repo mantainers.
2012-08-06T09:27:00.000Z	theadmin	mrgenixu1	Meh, me neither :D
2012-08-06T09:28:00.000Z	theadmin	mrgenixu1	Maybe you can just get the driver off nvidia.com somehow?
2012-08-06T09:30:00.000Z	theadmin	mrgenixu1	No, it's the Ubuntu repo mantainers' fault in this case.
2012-08-06T09:30:00.000Z	theadmin	mrgenixu1	NVidia are far better than AMD, trust me.
2012-08-06T09:30:00.000Z	mrgenixu1	theadmin	oh, preachin' to the choir
2012-08-06T09:32:00.000Z	theadmin	mrgenixu1	Wine only has official repos for fairly old Ubuntu versions, wine is in the official Ubuntu archives now.
2012-08-06T09:32:00.000Z	mrgenixu1	theadmin	AWESOME!
2012-08-06T09:32:00.000Z	mrgenixu1	theadmin	no.
