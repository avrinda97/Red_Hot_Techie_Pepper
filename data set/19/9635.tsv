2006-10-12T09:53:00.000Z	jake2		Windows is working just fine etc so i doubt it's any of my hardware
2006-10-12T09:54:00.000Z	jake2		Well, if linux forces me to unplug my HD I don't see why I would want to install it anyway... and on what drive would I install it then? =)
2006-10-12T09:55:00.000Z	jake2		Why would the live-cd even want to touch my HD? And the HD is working just fine, I've used chkdsk etc
2006-10-12T09:56:00.000Z	jake2		Just after i press enter on "Start Ubuntu (install)"
2006-10-12T09:56:00.000Z	jake2		and then It starts to load stuff, and there is when it crashes
2006-10-12T09:56:00.000Z	jake2		No, the "booter"
2006-10-12T09:58:00.000Z	jake2		gparted thinks its fine
2006-10-12T09:58:00.000Z	jake2		and chkdisk in windows thinks it fine
2006-10-12T09:58:00.000Z	jake2		i'm 99,9% sure it's no the hd
2006-10-12T09:59:00.000Z	jake2		i'm 99,99% sure there are NO bad clusters on my HD =)
2006-10-12T10:00:00.000Z	Courtney	jake2	all hard drives have clusters that are bad, thats why its not the full 60GB but it is really 57GB
2006-10-12T10:01:00.000Z	jake2	Courtney	No, that's not true
2006-10-12T10:01:00.000Z	jake2		It's because manufacturers count a kb as 1000b and the computer counts it as 1024b
2006-10-12T10:01:00.000Z	Courtney		When I hit enter on the Ubuntu CD that I ordered and select live/install, it brings me back to the Ubuntu CD Splash screen. Why is that?
2006-10-12T10:03:00.000Z	Courtney		or FTP
2006-10-12T10:04:00.000Z	jake2		So... I take it no one has any ideas then...? =/
2006-10-12T10:04:00.000Z	Courtney	jake2	what is your issue? PM please
2006-10-12T10:05:00.000Z	jake2	Courtney	I can't pm you because of the security...
2006-10-12T10:05:00.000Z	Courtney	jake2	what security?
