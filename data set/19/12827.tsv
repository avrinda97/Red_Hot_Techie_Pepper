2008-05-01T18:52:00.000Z	SliderMan		grub needs ext2 filesystem to work?
2008-05-01T18:53:00.000Z	SliderMan		i wanna make a bootable live usb for ubuntu :P
2008-05-01T18:53:00.000Z	SliderMan		im using widnows vista atm
2008-05-01T18:54:00.000Z	Dr_willis	SliderMan	 check out that 'pendrivelinux' web site - it has guides for doiung that stuff under windows and linux.
2008-05-04T16:47:00.000Z	Dr_willis	SliderMan	 the rar for linux may not support all the features. winrar.exe DID work under wine last i tried it.
2008-05-04T16:48:00.000Z	SliderMan	Dr_willis	wine (yuuuk)
2008-05-04T16:48:00.000Z	Dr_willis	SliderMan	 then do without I guess.
2008-05-04T16:48:00.000Z	Dr_willis	SliderMan	 'password protected rar files' - ICK!
2008-05-04T16:49:00.000Z	SliderMan	Dr_willis	thanks for the help anyways
2008-05-04T16:49:00.000Z	SliderMan	Dr_willis	wha?
2008-05-04T16:49:00.000Z	Dr_willis	SliderMan	 theres been many cases where people have rar archives with such new features. they have to use winrar.exe instead of the command line rar tools in linux.
2008-05-04T16:50:00.000Z	Dr_willis	SliderMan	 every time i see an rar archive - it always seems tobe some split up multi part rar that turns into a .zip that then contains a .iso.... :) go figure.
2008-05-04T16:50:00.000Z	SliderMan	Dr_willis	when you try to install unrar its works with the archive manager.
2008-05-04T16:50:00.000Z	Dr_willis	SliderMan	 and unrar may not have all the features that winrar.exe has.
2008-05-04T16:51:00.000Z	SliderMan	Dr_willis	thanks.
2008-05-04T16:51:00.000Z	Dr_willis	SliderMan	 at least with wine and winrar, you can delete the .wine dir every 30 days to get rid of the 'register this' nag screen. :)
2008-05-04T16:52:00.000Z	SliderMan	Dr_willis	or just download a carck
2008-05-04T16:52:00.000Z	Dr_willis	SliderMan	 :)   then ya will need a virus checker for your wine!
2008-05-04T16:52:00.000Z	SliderMan	Dr_willis	HAHA =)
