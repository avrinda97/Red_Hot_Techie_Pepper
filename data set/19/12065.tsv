2005-10-16T12:33:00.000Z	BreezyInCalif		Can I raise this qstn again, pls? I'm planning to resize a couple of partitions because I've run out of space on /usr and want to give it more space. Since that's dangerous, I wanted to sanity-check my plan before running around with scissors <g>
2005-10-16T12:33:00.000Z	BreezyInCalif		The plan: Backup /home. Take 15GB from /home (/dev/hda14 in my current scheme). Move /tmp, /var, and /usr/local (hda 11, hda12, and hda13) into the free space after current hda14. Move the free space that's left (there will be about 10GB left) so that it's adjacent to /usr (hda10 in current scheme). Add the space to /usr. Edit /etc/fstab to reflect changes. Mount /home and /usr manually to make sure they're OK.
2005-10-16T12:33:00.000Z	BreezyInCalif		Reboot. Go on with life.
2005-10-16T12:33:00.000Z	BreezyInCalif		lol
2005-10-16T12:33:00.000Z	BreezyInCalif		Thanks.
2005-10-16T12:34:00.000Z	magnusthe	BreezyInCalif	sounds reasonable... how are you planning on copy the data?
2005-10-16T12:34:00.000Z	magnusthe	BreezyInCalif	BTW moving /tmp isn't really necessary
2005-10-16T12:34:00.000Z	BreezyInCalif	magnusthe	- planning *nondestructive* resize with qtparted. __I hope!___
2005-10-16T12:35:00.000Z	magnusthe	BreezyInCalif	are you sure? my /tmp is tmpfs... i.e. not a real partition at all
2005-10-16T12:37:00.000Z	magnusthe	BreezyInCalif	just see what 'mount' outputs... chances are you are already using it (which means you have wasted space :)
2005-10-16T12:39:00.000Z	magnusthe	BreezyInCalif	ah, looks like you really are using a partition for /tmp, which isn't really necessary (actually it isn't to recommend)
2005-10-16T12:40:00.000Z	magnusthe	BreezyInCalif	please get a second opinion before you go ahead, I don't want to become known as "destroyer of Ubuntu systems"
2005-10-16T12:41:00.000Z	magnusthe	BreezyInCalif	you need to edit /etc/fstab manually
2005-10-16T12:41:00.000Z	magnusthe	BreezyInCalif	if you can wait until tomorrow you can always send me an email so I can get all the details right
2005-10-16T12:42:00.000Z	BreezyInCalif	magnusthe	- I can certainly wait; no urgency (or at least, I don't think I've got any urgency)
2005-10-16T12:43:00.000Z	magnusthe	BreezyInCalif	how the hell do I send a private message? I don't want to advertise my email address to the world
2005-10-16T12:43:00.000Z	BreezyInCalif	magnusthe	- type "/msg breezyincalif" and say hi ...
2005-10-16T12:45:00.000Z	magnusthe	BreezyInCalif	write down your plan as well so I can read through it with no pressure :)
