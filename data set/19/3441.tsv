2009-08-09T18:53:00.000Z	Guest53189		Hey guys
2009-08-09T18:55:00.000Z	Guest53189		I have a server here and if someone unplugs it and replugs it, it restarts until the login, but the network interface does not start. so the computer doesnt have his fixed IP and thus the machine is not able to get pinged (and externally to login)
2009-08-09T18:55:00.000Z	Guest53189		how can I make it, that the server starts the network interface BEFORE any login
2009-08-09T18:56:00.000Z	Guest53189		because I don't need local logins
2009-08-09T18:56:00.000Z	danbhfive	Guest53189	are you using interfaces or network-manager?
2009-08-09T18:56:00.000Z	Guest53189	danbhfive	atm network-manager from gnome, but I know my way around the interfaces, too
2009-08-09T18:57:00.000Z	danbhfive	Guest53189	I thought if you were using interfaces, it should connect to the network at startup
2009-08-09T18:57:00.000Z	danbhfive	Guest53189	yeah, I don't think network-manger will do it.  Use interfaces
2009-08-09T18:57:00.000Z	Guest53189	danbhfive	I guess you mean a startup script that up's the interface and sets an ip before the login part
2009-08-09T18:58:00.000Z	Guest53189	danbhfive	okay, so how can I change back to that and set a fixed ip for evere startup?
2009-08-09T18:58:00.000Z	danbhfive	Guest53189	no: /etc/network/interfaces
2009-08-09T18:59:00.000Z	Guest53189	danbhfive	I only have if-down.d  if-post-down.d if-pre-up.d if-up.d in that folder
2009-08-09T19:00:00.000Z	Guest53189	danbhfive	sorry,. it's there
2009-08-09T19:00:00.000Z	danbhfive	Guest53189	really?  erm, I dunno.  ah, ok
2009-08-09T19:00:00.000Z	Guest53189	danbhfive	auto lo \n iface lo inet loopback
