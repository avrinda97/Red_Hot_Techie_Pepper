2007-02-23T10:52:00.000Z	cables	tonyyarusso	this is slow business
2007-02-23T10:52:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	cables	Yeah....one day maybe I'll have something semi-automatic rather than retyping by sight.  lol.
2007-02-23T10:54:00.000Z	cables	tonyyarusso	sounds like a pretty easily detectable thing... just look for the DCC bit, and look for anyone who gets disconnected directly after...
2007-03-24T11:13:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	cables	everybody on Ubuntu runs a firewall - it's only a matter of how's it's configured
2007-04-09T06:19:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	cables	you could make it
2007-04-09T06:19:00.000Z	cables	tonyyarusso	the permissions settings for that exist?
2007-04-09T06:19:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	cables	Yeah, r and w are separate bits
2007-04-09T06:19:00.000Z	cables	tonyyarusso	ok
2007-04-09T06:19:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	cables	'man chmod' for details
2007-04-09T06:20:00.000Z	cables	tonyyarusso	k
2007-04-13T12:27:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	cables	?
2007-04-13T12:27:00.000Z	cables	tonyyarusso	Kevlar_Soul is ranting about a broken update, insulting devs, etc
2007-04-13T12:29:00.000Z	cables	tonyyarusso	his xchat-gnome version corresponds to feisty
2007-04-13T12:32:00.000Z	cables	tonyyarusso	I've versioned him, he's using an xchat-gnome version that corresponds to Feisty. If he knew how to custom-install a newer version, he'd probably know not to do this stuff.
2007-04-13T12:32:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	cables	I know.
2007-06-02T09:19:00.000Z	cables	tonyyarusso	he's already IN a terminal, I'm sure he knows how to find one.
2007-06-02T09:19:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	cables	ah, right.
2007-06-04T12:30:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	cables	still does, but not in this channel
2007-06-04T12:30:00.000Z	cables	tonyyarusso	ah.
