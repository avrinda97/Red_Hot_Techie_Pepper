2012-10-20T21:24:00.000Z	DaemonicApathy	arunkumar413	If the panel is revealed when you open the Dash, you may just want to disable auto-hide.
2012-10-20T21:24:00.000Z	arunkumar413	DaemonicApathy	i want to auto-hide.My problem is when i move the mouse it doesn't reveal
2012-10-20T21:25:00.000Z	DaemonicApathy	arunkumar413	Alternatively, you could adjust the sensitivity of the revel under System Settings > Appearance.
