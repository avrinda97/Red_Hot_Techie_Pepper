2009-01-14T13:35:00.000Z	_wasabi		does anyone here use sipe for pidgin on windows?
2009-01-14T13:37:00.000Z	_wasabi		well i was going to ask about cross compiling
2009-01-14T13:38:00.000Z	_wasabi		i'm trying to compile for windows
2009-01-14T13:39:00.000Z	_wasabi		i already have sipe on ubuntu. but i need to compile it for windows. i'm trying to get some help if anyone knows how to cross compile for windows
2009-01-14T13:39:00.000Z	ikonia	_wasabi	what are you trying to build ?
2009-01-14T13:41:00.000Z	_wasabi	ikonia	i'm trying to build sipe for pidgin. miranda_psi: i'm looking into gcc for cross compilation. i couldn't get cygwin to compile correctly under windows
2009-01-14T13:41:00.000Z	_wasabi	ikonia	| miranda_psi: sipe is the microsoft exchange plugin for pidgin
2009-01-14T13:41:00.000Z	ikonia	_wasabi	let me have a look at sipe, I don't know what it is, it is highly unlikley you will be able to build it for windows
2009-01-14T13:42:00.000Z	_wasabi	ikonia	yea i haven't had any luck with their latest code.
2009-01-14T13:43:00.000Z	ikonia	_wasabi	I don't think it is as it depends on glib librarues that are not available in windows
2009-01-14T13:43:00.000Z	_wasabi	ikonia	someone on their forum mentioned something regarding kerberos as the primary problem why it's not compiling for windows
2009-01-14T13:44:00.000Z	ikonia	_wasabi	I disagree,
2009-01-14T13:44:00.000Z	_wasabi	ikonia	hmm the older versions i had no problem compiling in windows
2009-01-14T13:44:00.000Z	ikonia	_wasabi	this depends on glib2  I don't see that being available for windows (I could be wrong)
2009-01-14T13:45:00.000Z	ikonia	_wasabi	either way, not really something for the #ubuntu channel to take forward as this isn't really an #ubuntu issue
2009-01-14T13:45:00.000Z	_wasabi	ikonia	http://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=5165627 but even when i cross compile in linux it doesn't work
2009-01-14T13:45:00.000Z	_wasabi	ikonia	ah okay
2009-01-14T13:45:00.000Z	ikonia	_wasabi	you may want to ask the pidgin or the windows guys
2009-01-14T13:45:00.000Z	_wasabi	ikonia	okay thanks man. i appreciate you looking into that
