2011-11-20T23:01:00.000Z	freko		I've installed dvb-apps and kafeine, downloaded the firmware for my dvb usb stick (dvb-usb-vp7045-01.fw  on linuxtv.org). I have placed it on /lib/firmware but after reboot Ubuntu assistant for digital TV installation doesn't recognize my dvb receiver.
2011-11-20T23:02:00.000Z	ikonia	freko	is the device seen by the OS ?
2011-11-20T23:03:00.000Z	ikonia	freko	ok, so you need to address that before dealing with any applications
2011-11-20T23:03:00.000Z	ikonia	freko	is the card supported by linux ?
2011-11-20T23:04:00.000Z	ikonia	freko	ok - so what does the syslog say about it, why can't it be seen

2011-11-20T23:13:00.000Z	ikonia	freko	I told you to forget about the application until you get the system to see it
2011-11-20T23:16:00.000Z	freko	ikonia	how can I add my peripherics on the systeme?
2011-11-20T23:16:00.000Z	ikonia	freko	you need to see if the system sees the device and what warning/error it gives when it see it in the sylog
2011-11-20T23:21:00.000Z	freko	ikonia	with cat and grep can you help my to parse my syslog file?

2011-11-20T23:30:00.000Z	freko	ikonia	i thinks the error msg is "Nov 20 19:29:21 media-serveur kernel: [ 6964.144037] usb 2-1: device descriptor read/64, error -62"
