2007-06-17T16:26:00.000Z	kingcobraeire	varka	thanks very much
2007-06-17T16:34:00.000Z	kingcobraeire	varka	alwa do you know what the version of the ubuntu or kubuntu desktop means
2007-06-17T16:35:00.000Z	varka	kingcobraeire	i think i dont really understand your question
2007-06-17T16:36:00.000Z	kingcobraeire	varka	in synaptic ubuntu desktop has a version of 1.43
2007-06-17T16:36:00.000Z	kingcobraeire	varka	what does that mean
2007-06-17T16:37:00.000Z	varka	kingcobraeire	its just the version of the metapackage that has the dependencies for the appropiate desktop environment, in fact it doesnt mean anything for the common user :)
2007-06-17T16:39:00.000Z	kingcobraeire	varka	ok well does each metapackage version mean a ubuntu version
2007-06-17T16:39:00.000Z	varka	kingcobraeire	no, definetely not
2007-06-17T16:40:00.000Z	varka	kingcobraeire	you always have only metapackages of one particular version of ubuntu in your repository, the one you are currently running
2007-06-17T16:41:00.000Z	kingcobraeire	varka	ok
2007-06-17T16:41:00.000Z	varka	kingcobraeire	if you want to install another version, you have to upgrade and therefore you would have to change your repositories to the appropiate version
2007-06-17T16:46:00.000Z	kingcobraeire	varka	do you know the command to upgrade to the latest version
2007-06-17T16:46:00.000Z	kingcobraeire	varka	also what do you mean change your repositories to the appropiate version
2007-06-17T16:51:00.000Z	kingcobraeire	varka	you there?
2007-06-17T05:13:00.000Z	varka	kingcobraeire	from what version to which version do you want to upgrade? as you should skip a version inbetween, its not supported
