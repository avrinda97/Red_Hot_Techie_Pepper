2008-04-21T03:48:00.000Z	ikonia	McJester	you have to mount the partition on your disk that contains /boot
2008-04-21T03:39:00.000Z	ikonia	McJester	what is the problem
2008-04-21T03:40:00.000Z	McJester	ikonia	I upgraded from 7.04 to 7.10, and it only boots to busy box
2008-04-21T03:40:00.000Z	ikonia	McJester	any errors/warnings ?
2008-04-21T03:41:00.000Z	ikonia	McJester	boot of a livecd and edit your menu.list changing hda3 to the uuid name of it or /dev/sda3
2008-04-21T03:42:00.000Z	McJester	ikonia	I only have the 6.10 live cd, will that work or will I have to download 7.10
2008-04-21T03:42:00.000Z	ikonia	McJester	6.10 will allow you to boot your machine and mount your harddisk
2008-04-21T03:42:00.000Z	ikonia	McJester	6.10 will not allow you to get the uuid so you'll need to use /dev/sda3 as a reference
2008-04-21T03:48:00.000Z	McJester	ikonia	after I boot the livecd where do I fine the menu.list
2008-04-21T03:51:00.000Z	McJester	ikonia	sorry I don't know how to mount the drive
2008-04-21T03:51:00.000Z	ikonia	McJester	mount /dev/sda3 /mnt
2008-04-21T03:51:00.000Z	ikonia	McJester	then look in /mnt
2008-04-21T03:53:00.000Z	McJester	ikonia	i mounted it, and now I'm in /mnt
2008-04-21T03:53:00.000Z	ikonia	McJester	 now edit boot/menu.lst to point at /dev/sda3
2008-04-21T04:01:00.000Z	McJester	ikonia	it needs an application
2008-04-21T04:01:00.000Z	ikonia	McJester	what ?
2008-04-21T04:01:00.000Z	McJester	ikonia	I'm still trying to edit the menu.lst
2008-04-21T04:01:00.000Z	ikonia	McJester	use a text editor
2008-04-21T04:02:00.000Z	McJester	ikonia	I tried that too, there is not menu.lst in the boot folder
