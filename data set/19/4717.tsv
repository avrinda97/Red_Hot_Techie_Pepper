2011-02-09T21:15:00.000Z	vish		err! thats for netzapper ^
2011-02-09T21:15:00.000Z	netzapper	vish	2012-04?
2011-02-09T21:16:00.000Z	vish		yup.
2011-02-09T21:16:00.000Z	netzapper		hmm... what about the backport issue? There's a pretty dire bug in the LTS version of pacemaker/corosync, and 10.10 has the newer package.
2011-02-09T21:17:00.000Z	vish	netzapper	but does the newer version fix the issue?
2011-02-09T21:17:00.000Z	netzapper	vish	the developers of the project are telling me that it does.
2011-02-09T21:18:00.000Z	vish	netzapper	then you'd(or they) just have to follow the sru process and it should be fixed
2011-02-09T21:18:00.000Z	vish		!sru | netzapper
2011-02-09T21:19:00.000Z	netzapper	vish	I see. Well, guess I'll get started on that.
2011-02-09T21:20:00.000Z	vish		!backport | netzapper
2011-02-09T21:20:00.000Z	vish	netzapper	that link might also help^
2011-02-09T21:22:00.000Z	netzapper	vish	alright, so it doesn't appear in lucid-backports. So, my recourse is to go through a bug report/SRU process?
2011-02-09T21:23:00.000Z	vish	netzapper	yup..
2011-02-09T21:23:00.000Z	netzapper	vish	and, if I'm reading this correctly, I need to actually build the fixed package?
2011-02-09T21:24:00.000Z	vish	netzapper	not necessarily *you*, but someone has to..
2011-02-09T21:25:00.000Z	netzapper	vish	I see. So, it's not as if I can just send in a bug report and Canonical will assign resources to fixing it. I've got to either do it myself, track down the original package maintainer and talk him/her into it, or talk the upstream devs into building a package?
2011-02-09T21:26:00.000Z	vish	netzapper	yes, btw, what app are you talking about?
2011-02-09T21:26:00.000Z	netzapper	vish	it's pacemaker/corosync. It's clustering software.
