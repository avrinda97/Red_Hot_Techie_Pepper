2007-02-02T13:59:00.000Z	Ralith	axa-axa	think vista, but cooler and doesn't need tons of resources
2007-02-02T14:01:00.000Z	axa-axa	Ralith	I'm really only interested in that will it be faster than Metacity with Gnome?
2007-02-02T14:01:00.000Z	Ralith	axa-axa	uh, no, adding high end fancy 3D effects typically doesn't make things faster.
2007-02-02T14:03:00.000Z	axa-axa	Ralith	That is what I wanted to hear. Thanks. In that case I'll stick to Metacity, the reason I was asking that is because I misundersood the point of use of "hardware acceleration" in Beryl.
2007-02-02T14:04:00.000Z	Ralith	axa-axa	heh. It uses it because it NEEDS to. Everything uses 2D acceleration, anyway.
2007-02-02T14:05:00.000Z	axa-axa	Ralith	That's what I said, my bad. In case I want to see for myself what is the fus about, and install it, do I need just to do 'sudo update-alternatives --config x-window-manager' and select Beryl to use it with Gnome?
2007-02-02T14:08:00.000Z	Ralith	axa-axa	no, you just need to add beryl-manager to your gnome session autostart programs.
2007-02-02T14:09:00.000Z	Ralith	axa-axa	you, of course, need it installed
2007-02-02T14:09:00.000Z	axa-axa	Ralith	That's all? And what about Metacity, will it be running while Beryl does?
2007-02-02T14:10:00.000Z	Ralith	axa-axa	no, it won't.
2007-02-02T14:10:00.000Z	Ralith	axa-axa	and yes, that's all
2007-02-02T14:10:00.000Z	Ralith	axa-axa	don't try it if you don't have accelerated 3D working
2007-02-02T14:10:00.000Z	axa-axa	Ralith	Last question: Should I kill Metacity after I start Beryl?
2007-02-02T14:11:00.000Z	Ralith	axa-axa	no, it takes care of that itself
2007-02-02T14:13:00.000Z	Ralith	axa-axa	beryl-manager, remember
2007-02-02T14:13:00.000Z	axa-axa	Ralith	? You mean I should download that?
2007-02-02T14:14:00.000Z	Ralith	axa-axa	sudo apt-get install beryl-manager
2007-02-02T14:14:00.000Z	Ralith	axa-axa	and emerald-themes too
2007-02-02T14:14:00.000Z	axa-axa	Ralith	Ok, thanks a lot Ralith
