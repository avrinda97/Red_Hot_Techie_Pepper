2004-10-04T14:56:00.000Z	lml		Are there somebody running MythTV on Ubuntu?
2004-10-04T14:57:00.000Z	mdz	lml	I will be shortly
2004-10-04T14:58:00.000Z	lml	mdz	Do you know if there are packages available to ease the installation?
2004-10-04T14:58:00.000Z	mdz	lml	there will be shortly :-)
2004-10-04T14:58:00.000Z	lml	mdz	How shortly ;-)
2004-10-04T14:58:00.000Z	mdz	lml	I maintain the packages
2004-10-04T14:59:00.000Z	lml	mdz	All packages or just MythTV?
2004-10-04T14:59:00.000Z	mdz	lml	the mythtv packages for Debian
2004-10-04T15:00:00.000Z	lml	mdz	Ok and to my understanding it is not wise to use Debian packages under Ubuntu?
2004-10-04T15:00:00.000Z	mdz	lml	in general, no, but if there is anything available for Debian which is not available for Ubuntu, let us know and we will correct that
2004-10-04T15:02:00.000Z	lml	mdz	& goatboy_: What is the tasks to do a rebuild of the Debian packages? Or is it easier (for a novice) to do a complie from source.
2004-10-04T15:03:00.000Z	mdz	lml	I will be providing mythtv packages built for ubuntu, if you can be patient
2004-10-04T15:04:00.000Z	lml	mdz	I am patient, just would like an estimate on the arival ;-)
2004-10-04T15:04:00.000Z	mdz	lml	I estimate <24 hours
2004-10-04T15:05:00.000Z	lml	mdz	Very nice, I will not start the installation until next week. Just doing preparations.
2004-10-04T15:05:00.000Z	mdz	lml	no hurry, then
2004-10-04T15:06:00.000Z	lml	mdz	As part of my preparations I am a bit puzzled that neither TVTime or xawTV is to be found as a package.
2004-10-04T15:07:00.000Z	mdz	lml	they are in universe
2004-10-04T15:08:00.000Z	lml	mdz	Thanx again.
