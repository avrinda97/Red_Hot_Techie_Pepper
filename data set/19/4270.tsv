2009-02-16T19:50:00.000Z	Myrtti	Workk1	do you have xchat-gnome or xchat?
2009-02-16T19:51:00.000Z	Workk1	Myrtti	: I am using xchat gnome
2009-02-16T19:51:00.000Z	Myrtti	Workk1	xchat-gnome is a totally different app than xchat, that's why it looks different from what in Windows
2009-02-16T19:52:00.000Z	Myrtti	Workk1	xchat is graphical as well
2009-02-16T19:52:00.000Z	Myrtti	Workk1	if you've used xchat in Windows and now how to use that, then uninstall xchat-gnome and install xchat instead.
