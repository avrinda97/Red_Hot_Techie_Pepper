2010-11-19T09:08:00.000Z	willis__		but in the installer it happened within a minute or two, in the actual OS i guess it takes 10-20
2010-11-19T09:09:00.000Z	willis__		desktop
2010-11-19T09:10:00.000Z	willis__		i believe it's NAT'ed, but at this point i'm just wondering how to uninstall ubuntu
2010-11-19T09:10:00.000Z	willis__		it has broken my spirit, after 3 days of attempts
2010-11-19T09:11:00.000Z	willis__		is there more to it than erasing the partition? will i need to reformat the disk?
2010-11-19T09:12:00.000Z	willis__		thank you amtrask, i think i'm finally going to have to give a different linux flavor a try
2010-11-19T09:12:00.000Z	willis__		as much as i really wanted to make this work
2010-11-19T09:12:00.000Z	willis__		i did
2010-11-19T09:12:00.000Z	willis__		10.10
2010-11-19T09:13:00.000Z	willis__		i was so pumped when the alternate installer finally worked and i booted the system, but i can't handle the dual smackdown of failed network connections and interface devices =) and i take a lot with a smile
2010-11-19T09:15:00.000Z	airtonix	willis__	Amtrask mint is just ubuntu with a different theme
2010-11-19T10:39:00.000Z	airtonix	willis__	enable the pxeboot option from the desktop (hopefully it has one) and setup your laptop to be a dhcp and tftp server
2010-11-19T10:40:00.000Z	willis__	airtonix	is that option in the bios? that seems to be the only thing i can effectively access on the desktop
2010-11-19T10:40:00.000Z	airtonix	willis__	if the desktop bios does not allow for pxeboot , then you can use PLOP iso
2010-11-19T10:40:00.000Z	willis__	airtonix	thanks, writing all this down
2010-11-19T10:41:00.000Z	airtonix	willis__	i assume your goal is to repair the grub instance already isntalled on the machine ?
2010-11-19T10:42:00.000Z	willis__	airtonix	anything that will allow me to boot into winxp, which is the only os that's been functional and stable
2010-11-19T10:42:00.000Z	airtonix	willis__	ok i think you'll need to ask about bartPE in ##windows
2010-11-19T10:43:00.000Z	willis__	airtonix	can you just tell me generally what that is before i ask about it?
