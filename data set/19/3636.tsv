2009-06-25T13:47:00.000Z	chrism2671		does anybody know which package the fuse kernel module is in?
2009-06-25T13:49:00.000Z	raylu	chrism2671	http://packages.ubuntu.com/jaunty/user-mode-linux
2009-06-25T13:53:00.000Z	chrism2671	raylu	are you sure? that seems like a lot of installing for something quite trivial? in addition, I don't see how it's relevant?
2009-06-25T13:54:00.000Z	raylu	chrism2671	i just did a search for fuse.ko and that was the only result. you shouldn't have to install it manually as it comes by default with ubuntu-desktop
2009-06-25T13:55:00.000Z	chrism2671	raylu	that's what I thought, but it refuses to enable it, saying module not found (for modprobe fuse)
2009-06-25T13:56:00.000Z	raylu	chrism2671	which fs are you trying to use?
2009-06-25T13:57:00.000Z	chrism2671	raylu	sshfs
2009-06-25T13:58:00.000Z	raylu	chrism2671	then just install that and use it. you shouldn't have to bother with the kernel module
2009-06-25T13:59:00.000Z	chrism2671	raylu	i'm trying but apparently it does matter- i'm trying to use it to sync tomboy over ssh
2009-06-25T14:00:00.000Z	raylu	chrism2671	do you have sshfs installed? what's the command you're using to mount?
2009-06-25T14:01:00.000Z	chrism2671	raylu	i'm not- i'm doing it through the tomboy gui
2009-06-25T14:01:00.000Z	chrism2671	raylu	sshfs is installed
2009-06-25T14:03:00.000Z	raylu	chrism2671	this tomboy think looks like a load of fail
2009-06-25T14:03:00.000Z	chrism2671	raylu	i believe so, unfortunately
2009-06-25T14:03:00.000Z	chrism2671	raylu	shame, it's a really useful program
2009-06-25T14:03:00.000Z	raylu	chrism2671	anyway, what does tomboy say and what are you trying to do?
2009-06-25T14:04:00.000Z	chrism2671	raylu	then when i click enable, it says failed
2009-06-25T14:04:00.000Z	chrism2671	raylu	to be honest i think i'm going to leave it for the minute, i have actual work to do- i had hoped it would be a quick fix but i guess not!
2009-06-25T14:04:00.000Z	raylu	chrism2671	dmesg | tail may be of help. so might running tomboy in the terminal
