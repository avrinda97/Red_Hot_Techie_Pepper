2005-10-31T12:35:00.000Z	vbgunz		hello all, 've just reached the end of the "man ssh" page in the console... How do I break out of it and get back to the command line? I am pressing Ctrl+C but nothing s happening
2005-10-31T12:35:00.000Z	_jason	vbgunz	 q
2005-12-15T12:46:00.000Z	_jason	vbgunz	^Z
2005-12-15T12:46:00.000Z	_jason	vbgunz	that suspends
2005-12-15T12:46:00.000Z	vbgunz	_jason	^Z stopped nohup :(
2005-12-15T12:48:00.000Z	_jason	vbgunz	okay well that gives you a job number.  So if you want it in the foreground: fg %1.  Background: bg %1.  where 1 is the job number
2005-12-15T12:49:00.000Z	vbgunz	_jason	not sure how job numbers work out :P
2005-12-15T12:49:00.000Z	_jason	vbgunz	k, you could probably use ALT+F2 to run it too
2005-12-15T12:50:00.000Z	vbgunz	_jason	I like running it from the terminal :) Major thanks though, I didn't know about ^Z... Thanks (That's suspend?) !
2005-12-15T12:51:00.000Z	_jason	vbgunz	yep, google for "job control bash"  you'll learna ll about bg and fg... you can stop by using kill %1 too
2005-12-15T12:59:00.000Z	vbgunz	_jason	I got a sweet document on bash control... your google term struck gold :)
2005-12-15T12:59:00.000Z	vbgunz	_jason	Thanks bro!
2005-12-18T14:27:00.000Z	_jason	vbgunz	how about aaaaaa
2005-12-18T14:28:00.000Z	vbgunz	_jason	yeah, am doing that now, but don't like it... Maybe there is something else I can use?
2005-12-18T14:29:00.000Z	_jason	vbgunz	how about the 0 that xspades suggested?
2005-12-18T14:30:00.000Z	vbgunz	_jason	numbers and letters work... was just trying to use a symbol instead... It's a quirk I have :P
2005-12-18T14:30:00.000Z	_jason	vbgunz	ah
2006-04-27T10:41:00.000Z	_jason	vbgunz	might have better luck in #ubuntu+1 with dapper questions
2006-04-27T10:42:00.000Z	vbgunz	_jason	ahh yeah, sorry :)
