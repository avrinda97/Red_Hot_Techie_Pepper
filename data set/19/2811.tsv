2010-02-03T23:53:00.000Z	TomV_415		I'm having a challenge - I upgraded my hard drive, and cloned the partitions of the old one onto the new one (using Windows), now I can't get boot loader to work, after trying for many hours...
2010-02-03T23:53:00.000Z	TomV_415		I'm able to get to windows via supergrub (1.2.1)
2010-02-03T23:54:00.000Z	michaeldobrovits	TomV_415	have you tried a livecd and chroot into it?
2010-02-03T23:54:00.000Z	TomV_415	michaeldobrovits	sort of.. I did that as part of one of the web pages on how to fix..http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/d69f6c7c0
2010-02-03T23:55:00.000Z	TomV_415	michaeldobrovits	(more details on what i've done there.)
2010-02-03T23:55:00.000Z	michaeldobrovits	TomV_415	try setuping grub
2010-02-03T23:55:00.000Z	michaeldobrovits	TomV_415	maybe you didn't clone the hdd fully?
2010-02-03T23:56:00.000Z	TomV_415	michaeldobrovits	looks right when I look at everything via live cd... but good question.
2010-02-03T23:56:00.000Z	michaeldobrovits	TomV_415	and make sure bios is set on new hdd
2010-02-03T23:56:00.000Z	TomV_415	michaeldobrovits	I did set up grub, but I don't really understand the mount stuff... so it may not have stuck
2010-02-03T23:57:00.000Z	TomV_415	michaeldobrovits	new hard drive is replacing the old one, and boots correctly when i use supergrub
2010-02-03T23:58:00.000Z	michaeldobrovits	TomV_415	if youd go to livecd we can try together to see what the issue is. if it boot fine why doesn't your linux boots?
2010-02-03T23:58:00.000Z	TomV_415	michaeldobrovits	 I do see that Gparted doesn't understand the partion, but Disk Utils sees everythnig
2010-02-03T23:59:00.000Z	TomV_415	michaeldobrovits	I have it running on live CD now.. (I'm typing from a borrowed lapop

2010-02-03T23:59:00.000Z	michaeldobrovits	TomV_415	what wass there before?
2010-02-04T00:00:00.000Z	TomV_415	michaeldobrovits	each partition is a bit different, see http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/d69f6c7c0 for the filesystem lists (ntfs and ext3 are set up.)
