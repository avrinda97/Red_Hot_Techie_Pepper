2011-12-24T05:59:00.000Z	cypher-neo	|Shay|	Try GNOME Shell!
2011-12-24T06:00:00.000Z	|Shay|	cypher-neo	detaisl?
2011-12-24T06:00:00.000Z	cypher-neo	|Shay|	GNOME Shell is a more intuitive approach to the desktop, similar to Unity but far more customizable and flexible.
2011-12-24T06:01:00.000Z	cypher-neo	|Shay|	To install it and preview, 'sudo apt-get install gnome-shell'
2011-12-24T06:01:00.000Z	cypher-neo	|Shay|	The gnome-shell package is only included in the Oneiric repository though. Earlier distros need a PPA which I can look up if you need.
2011-12-24T06:02:00.000Z	|Shay|	cypher-neo	Thanks! I already thought to do apt-get for it, running 11.10
2011-12-24T06:02:00.000Z	|Shay|	cypher-neo	Will try. Im not home, hence the SSH/
2011-12-24T06:03:00.000Z	cypher-neo	|Shay|	Let me find a link for you. I'll show you a preview of the GNOME Shell running, and some of it's cool features. One sec...
2011-12-24T06:03:00.000Z	|Shay|	cypher-neo	Awesome. Thanks.
2011-12-24T06:04:00.000Z	cypher-neo	|Shay|	Looks something like this http://www.gnome.org/gnome-3/
2011-12-24T06:04:00.000Z	|Shay|	cypher-neo	looks better than Unity
2011-12-24T06:05:00.000Z	cypher-neo	|Shay|	Works better too!
2011-12-24T06:05:00.000Z	cypher-neo	|Shay|	I had my FIRST problem about 20 minutes ago, but only because I installed a theme that wasn't compatible. lol
2011-12-24T06:06:00.000Z	cypher-neo	|Shay|	If you don't mind joining me in #ubuntu-offtopic I can show you some more pictures, this time of my desktop.
2011-12-24T06:06:00.000Z	|Shay|	cypher-neo	Sure
2011-12-24T06:12:00.000Z	|Shay|	cypher-neo	I imagine I need to reboot to apply things, yes?
2011-12-24T07:04:00.000Z	|Shay|	cypher-neo	So I purged Unity Compiz lightdm and installed gnome-shell guess what I have over RDP? Working Unity MIND BLOWN @.@
