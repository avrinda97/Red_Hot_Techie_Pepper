2005-07-02T12:14:00.000Z	Xyc0	IceDC571	What are you trying to test?
2005-07-02T12:14:00.000Z	IceDC571	Xyc0	the sound in my totem player seems not to be working, i just want to make sure
2005-07-02T12:15:00.000Z	Xyc0	IceDC571	www.ubuntuguide.org

2005-07-02T12:16:00.000Z	Xyc0	IceDC571	that site will help you do alot on ubuntu
2005-07-02T12:16:00.000Z	IceDC571	Xyc0	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NewUsersNetworkGuidelines read #3
2005-07-02T12:18:00.000Z	Xyc0	IceDC571	wow I quit linux.  ubuntuguide.org helped me so much more then anything ubuntu put out officially.  I will not stand by idly while elitist oppress the inexperienced
2005-07-02T12:19:00.000Z	IceDC571	Xyc0	i agree actually.. but the admins kill me everytime i mention it
2005-07-02T12:19:00.000Z	Xyc0	IceDC571	then let them do their job, and Ill do mine
2005-07-02T12:35:00.000Z	Xyc0	IceDC571	yea, i tried pushing FC, but ubuntu makes so much sence
2005-07-02T12:36:00.000Z	IceDC571	Xyc0	well.. the 4 cds download everytime they release a new version is enough to make me switch
2005-07-02T12:38:00.000Z	Xyc0	IceDC571	you only need to use 3, and there are workarounds where you dont have to burn them to disks.  But overall, ubuntu is focused on practicality, where FC4 is focused on testing new software for RHE
2005-07-02T12:43:00.000Z	Xyc0	IceDC571	DC on gaim works well with other gaim users
2005-07-02T12:44:00.000Z	IceDC571	Xyc0	nice.. now i gotta get all my windows friends to switch
2005-07-14T10:14:00.000Z	IceDC571	Xyc0	you mean splashy?
