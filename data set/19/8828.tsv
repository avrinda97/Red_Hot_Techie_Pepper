2007-02-13T08:26:00.000Z	gortba_		Hi everyone. I have a textbook on C++ that I want to work through to teach myself how to program. Can anyone tell me what program I need to install on my linux machine to get started?
2007-02-13T08:27:00.000Z	shatrat	gortba_	well, build-essential will get you a compiler along with source code for the kernel and other good stuff.
2007-02-13T08:27:00.000Z	shatrat	gortba_	but you might want an IDE as well.  I think jgrasp is a decent one for beginners.
2007-02-13T08:28:00.000Z	shatrat	gortba_	Integrated Development Environment.
2007-02-13T08:29:00.000Z	shatrat	gortba_	IDE is basically a text editor that checks syntax and has a Compile button.
2007-02-13T08:31:00.000Z	gortba_	shatrat	I can just download both build essential and jgrasp from the repository--and they'll work together?
2007-02-13T08:32:00.000Z	shatrat	gortba_	I dont know if jgrasp is in the repo, Im sure there are some IDEs though, and I bet theres plenty of guides
2007-02-13T09:00:00.000Z	gortba_	shatrat	you still here?
2007-02-13T09:00:00.000Z	shatrat	gortba_	yes
2007-02-13T09:02:00.000Z	shatrat	gortba_	if you run "which jgrasp" or whatever the name of the link is, does it return jgrasp?
2007-02-13T09:03:00.000Z	gortba_	shatrat	yes
2007-02-13T09:04:00.000Z	shatrat	gortba_	but just running "jgrasp" doesnt do anything?
2007-02-13T09:04:00.000Z	shatrat	gortba_	what error?
2007-02-13T09:04:00.000Z	gortba_	shatrat	here's the error:  Error at jGRASP startup:
2007-02-13T09:04:00.000Z	shatrat	gortba_	stand by
2007-02-13T09:09:00.000Z	shatrat	gortba_	what language did you settle on trying first btw?
2007-02-13T09:11:00.000Z	shatrat	gortba_	to get jgrasp running youre gonna have to get some java dependencies taken care of, there are other IDEs in the repositores though.  Try searching for "development environment"
2007-02-13T09:12:00.000Z	gortba_	shatrat	cool thanks again! I'll have a look
2007-02-13T09:12:00.000Z	shatrat	gortba_	theres one called "geany" that might be good for starters.
