2007-01-22T10:32:00.000Z	AWOSLappy		I need this:
2007-01-22T10:32:00.000Z	AWOSLappy		00000000  48 54 54 50 2f 31 2e 31  20 32 30 30 20 4f 4b 0d HTTP/1.1  200 OK.
2007-01-22T10:32:00.000Z	AWOSLappy		to become just plain
2007-01-22T10:32:00.000Z	AWOSLappy		HTTP/1.1  200 OK\r
2007-01-22T10:34:00.000Z	AWOSLappy		but the problem is
2007-01-22T10:34:00.000Z	AWOSLappy		There are lines like this
2007-01-22T10:34:00.000Z	AWOSLappy		00001DB6  91 40 31 9a 9c 16 e3 2f  78 f1 36 8c 50 c6 b7 9d .@1..../ x.6.P...
2007-01-22T10:34:00.000Z	AWOSLappy		AND lines like this
2007-01-22T10:34:00.000Z	AWOSLappy		00001DC6  90 49 5f f6                                      .I_.
2007-01-22T10:35:00.000Z	AWOSLappy		so I can't just use a Perl script and strip out those 32 hex chars
2007-01-22T10:35:00.000Z	Flannel	AWOSLappy	please stop using your enter key as punctuation
2007-01-22T10:35:00.000Z	AWOSLappy	Flannel	sorry is that not permitted here?
2007-01-22T10:35:00.000Z	Flannel	AWOSLappy	there's 900 people, lines scroll plenty fast without people using "enter" as commas ;)
2007-01-22T10:36:00.000Z	AWOSLappy	Flannel	since I have your attention anyways, do you have a solution to my problem?  Or should I go to like #perl or is there another channel?
2007-01-22T10:38:00.000Z	Flannel	AWOSLappy	#perl would be a good choice, #ubuntu-offtopic is also equally suitable
2007-01-22T10:39:00.000Z	Flannel	AWOSLappy	you'd probably do best stripping out any `[a-f0-9] {2} `
2007-01-22T10:40:00.000Z	Flannel	AWOSLappy	just, any byte with a space after it.  Although I suppose you'd have an issue if your text was literally "two hex chars and a space"
2007-01-22T10:44:00.000Z	AWOSLappy	Flannel	soblue, it isn't an HTML document I'm parsing, it's a literal file, think ISO file, I'm stripping out
2007-01-22T10:45:00.000Z	Flannel	AWOSLappy	right, but there are strings in regular files as well, and normal other bytes, etc.  You might instead look into ethereal about how to just output the contents of a file, which I do believe is doable.
