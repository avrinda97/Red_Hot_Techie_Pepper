2011-07-02T19:56:00.000Z	sgo11	Sidewinder1	why do I sudo nautilus? I don't really get it. thanks.
2011-07-02T19:57:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	sgo11	That will allow you to have temporary root privleges in Nautilus if the directories are not owned by you.
2011-07-02T19:59:00.000Z	sgo11	Sidewinder1	ok. but that is not my question at all. In terminal, to remove an empty directory, I can use rmdir. if the directory is not empty, it will give me warning. this is good and safe. I am just wondering if nautilus has the same functionality. so when to delete a directory, it will warn you whether that is empty or not. currently, it doesn't.
2011-07-02T20:01:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	sgo11	In Nautilus, if it's empty, won't it sat "0" files???
2011-07-02T20:02:00.000Z	sgo11	Sidewinder1	it doesn't say anything useful. just warn you you are about to delete a directory. that's all.
2011-07-02T20:02:00.000Z	sgo11	Sidewinder1	you can just try it.
2011-07-02T20:03:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	sgo11	I only use terminal as a last resort; I prefer GUI, hence my suggestion of Nautilus; if I was unclear, I apologize.
2011-07-02T20:04:00.000Z	sgo11	Sidewinder1	no worries. thanks for your help.
2011-09-01T18:51:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	sgo11	But you know what happens when one assumes. :-)
2011-09-01T18:52:00.000Z	sgo11	Sidewinder1	^_^
2011-12-06T16:01:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	sgo11	Since there's a problem, I wouldn't close anything; just let it "do it's thing".
2011-12-06T16:02:00.000Z	sgo11	Sidewinder1	I have restarted the laptop. I have partial 11.10 now. what to do? thanks.
2011-12-06T16:04:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	sgo11	I know it's not what you wanna' hear, but, I have no idea why. :-(
2011-12-06T16:05:00.000Z	sgo11	Sidewinder1	thanks for the reply. it doesn't matter why now. what to do next to have a full 11.10 installation?
2011-12-06T16:06:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	sgo11	Hope you backed up everything prior to; any specific error messages, other than couldn't upgrade?
2011-12-06T16:07:00.000Z	sgo11	Sidewinder1	no error message at all. it just said the upgrade is aborted.
2011-12-06T16:09:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	sgo11	Also, I'm on 10.04, so I'm not sure how much help I can be, trouble-shooting 11.10. I'd just keep trying it until something goes "Hinckey." I wonder if it may have been a 'false error message'.
2011-12-06T16:10:00.000Z	sgo11	Sidewinder1	ok. thanks for the reply.
