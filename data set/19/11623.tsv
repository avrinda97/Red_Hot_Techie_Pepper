2012-08-23T21:16:00.000Z	kwyjibo		oh come on. i know there must be a way to do it
2012-08-23T21:18:00.000Z	kwyjibo		is it somehow a manner of dynamically extending the root partition with sdcard storage?
2012-08-23T21:20:00.000Z	usr13	kwyjibo	What are you trying to do?
2012-08-23T21:35:00.000Z	kwyjibo	usr13	http://paste.ubuntu.com/1163045
2012-08-23T21:21:00.000Z	kwyjibo	usr13	i have a netbook with 16gb ssd and two sdcard slots (one can be dedicated to extra storage all the time). but ubuntu treats the sdcard as an extra ejectable media. i want it to absorb the sdcard to extend the total storage
2012-08-23T21:21:00.000Z	usr13	kwyjibo	How big are they?
2012-08-23T21:21:00.000Z	usr13	kwyjibo	What are their sizes?
2012-08-23T21:22:00.000Z	kwyjibo	usr13	16 gig SSD, 32 gig SDcard
2012-08-23T21:23:00.000Z	usr13	kwyjibo	So you want to use the 32G SD card permanently?
2012-08-23T21:23:00.000Z	kwyjibo	usr13	and how!
2012-08-23T21:23:00.000Z	usr13	kwyjibo	I should take that as a yes?
2012-08-23T21:23:00.000Z	kwyjibo	usr13	yeah
2012-08-23T21:24:00.000Z	usr13	kwyjibo	So right now, you are just working from the 16G only?
2012-08-23T21:25:00.000Z	kwyjibo	usr13	yes. and gnome has this HUD thing always popping up at the bottom, suggesting i eject the sdcard. very intrusive
2012-08-23T21:26:00.000Z	usr13	kwyjibo	Ok then.  My suggestion would be to use the 32G for /home/ the 16G for /
2012-08-23T21:27:00.000Z	kwyjibo	usr13	a lot of unused space then? can it just treat the two as one device?
2012-08-23T21:27:00.000Z	usr13	kwyjibo	No
2012-08-23T21:28:00.000Z	usr13	kwyjibo	pastebinit /etc/fstab  #Give us resulting URL
2012-08-23T21:37:00.000Z	usr13	kwyjibo	sudo fdisk -l >info;sudo blkid >>info;pastebinit info;rm info  #And send resulting URL
