2009-01-07T13:23:00.000Z	nucc1		who is the "web-user" on ubuntu? the one apache runs as...
2009-01-07T13:23:00.000Z	hischild_laptop	nucc1	it's exactly as you say, it's the user apache uses to run the webserver. This is so it doesn't run as root which starts it.
2009-01-07T13:23:00.000Z	nucc1	hischild_laptop	I want to iknow the "username"

2009-01-07T13:24:00.000Z	nucc1	hischild_laptop	so that I can assign ownership of a folder to it :)
2009-01-07T13:24:00.000Z	hischild_laptop	nucc1	add yourself to the owners group is probably much easier. Besides, the web user needs to have read access and in case of php that needs to write, also write access.
2009-01-07T13:25:00.000Z	nucc1	hischild_laptop	and what is the group name?
2009-01-07T13:26:00.000Z	hischild_laptop	nucc1	in a terminal go to the folder where you have stored the files  and type this --> ls -l
2009-01-07T13:26:00.000Z	hischild_laptop	nucc1	it'll show you the user and group owning them.
2009-01-07T13:27:00.000Z	nucc1	hischild_laptop	/var/www seems to be owned by root...
2009-01-07T13:28:00.000Z	hischild_laptop	nucc1	1 more folder down
2009-01-07T13:28:00.000Z	nucc1	hischild_laptop	I want to find out who the web user is, so that I can make a folder owned by that user, to avoid having to make it world-readable. am I making sense?

2009-01-07T13:29:00.000Z	hischild_laptop	nucc1	yes, 1 second, a server is bugging here.
2009-01-07T13:29:00.000Z	nucc1	hischild_laptop	I'm not a beginner with this stuff, if that helps. I've looked in "users-admin" but can't find anything helpful
2009-01-07T13:32:00.000Z	hischild_laptop	nucc1	ps aux | grep apache shows that mine runs as www-data leading me to believe that creating a folder with that ownership should be sufficient for what you want.
2009-01-07T13:33:00.000Z	nucc1	hischild_laptop	just saw that. I had to go check "show all" in gconf to make user-admin to display all :(
2009-01-07T13:33:00.000Z	nucc1		thanks
2009-01-07T13:34:00.000Z	hischild_laptop	nucc1	i gotta go for a bit. GL =)
