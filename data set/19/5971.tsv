2008-04-08T19:51:00.000Z	Creationist	AngryBacon	It lacks FULL video support :)
2008-04-08T19:52:00.000Z	AngryBacon	Creationist	lol, 18fps
2008-04-08T19:52:00.000Z	Creationist	AngryBacon	It's a 2-inch screen... you need a better framerate? lol
2008-04-08T19:53:00.000Z	AngryBacon	Creationist	I fail to see the correlation between the screensize & frame rate
2008-04-08T19:54:00.000Z	AngryBacon	Creationist	also, my 6th gen ipod isn't sopported
2008-04-08T19:54:00.000Z	Creationist	AngryBacon	My point is that on such a small screen, only 18fps won't be discernable from 30fps.
2008-04-08T19:54:00.000Z	AngryBacon	Creationist	who,s your isp?
2008-04-08T19:54:00.000Z	Creationist	AngryBacon	Yeah, Apple destroyed linux support... Microsoft will soon too.  Of course, the Apple "blocking" was cracked within hours :)
2008-04-08T19:55:00.000Z	Creationist	AngryBacon	Until later this afternoon I'm with Comcast.
2008-04-08T19:56:00.000Z	AngryBacon	Creationist	yeah' comcast sucks, but i can,t find any dsl with decent speed arund here
2008-04-08T19:56:00.000Z	Creationist	AngryBacon	Well, I'm huge for speed... the highest AT&T offers is "up to" 6mbps.
2008-04-08T19:57:00.000Z	AngryBacon	Creationist	the best i can get on DSL is 1.5
2008-04-08T19:57:00.000Z	Creationist	AngryBacon	Is that the highest service they offer?  Or just your top speed?
2008-04-08T19:57:00.000Z	AngryBacon	Creationist	top avail in my area
2008-04-08T19:58:00.000Z	Creationist	AngryBacon	With Comcast, I was paying $55/month for 3mbps.  The AT&T service I'm getting is $35 for 6mbps :)
2008-04-08T19:58:00.000Z	AngryBacon	Creationist	i get 10mbps w/comcast when it works
2008-04-08T19:59:00.000Z	Creationist	AngryBacon	Heh... never gotten that before. I've gotten up to 3.5 down I think.
