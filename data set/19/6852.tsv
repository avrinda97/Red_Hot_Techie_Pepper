2007-12-20T16:10:00.000Z	simion314		is there a way to edit enviroment variables? at least i need to find the file that adds to my variable something that i must remove, hot can i search in all the files in my home for a string?
2007-12-20T16:11:00.000Z	TTilus	simion314	grep
2007-12-20T16:11:00.000Z	TTilus	simion314	grep 'whatyouwannafind' -r ~/
2007-12-20T16:11:00.000Z	TTilus	simion314	searches recursively thru _everything_ inside your home
2007-12-20T16:19:00.000Z	simion314	TTilus	 after some warnings the computer seams to sleep but the control is not back in the terminal, it seams that grep is still working but the computer seem sleaping
2007-12-20T16:26:00.000Z	TTilus	simion314	it's not sleeping, it's searching
2007-12-20T16:26:00.000Z	TTilus	simion314	was it env variable you were looking for?
2007-12-20T16:27:00.000Z	TTilus	simion314	first check /etc/environment
2007-12-20T16:28:00.000Z	simion314	TTilus	yes i search for a file that it puts some  variables in my system, i removed the entries in  in bashrc or something like this but it had no efect, i restarted computer
2007-12-20T16:28:00.000Z	TTilus	simion314	then ~/.bashrc  and ~/.profile
2007-12-20T16:28:00.000Z	TTilus	simion314	you do not need restart, only relogin
2007-12-20T16:28:00.000Z	simion314	TTilus	thx i ll search there
2007-12-20T16:29:00.000Z	TTilus	simion314	what's the variable?
2007-12-20T16:29:00.000Z	TTilus	simion314	you could pastebin you env (type env to console and press enter) and point out the not-wanted variables and i'll see if i know something about them
2007-12-20T16:31:00.000Z	TTilus	simion314	and of course you can always do export VAR=value on command line and have the current login env changed
2007-12-20T16:32:00.000Z	simion314	TTilus	thx, i found them in .profile too, i will remove them but i must add other corects. thx again
2007-12-20T16:44:00.000Z	TTilus	simion314	"them"?  what did you actually remove?
2007-12-20T16:44:00.000Z	TTilus	simion314	just curious
2007-12-20T17:02:00.000Z	TTilus	simion314	ah, okay
