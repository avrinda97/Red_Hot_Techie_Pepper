2009-01-26T07:51:00.000Z	wpgmb		Cojabo: are you planning on running an other OS inside Ubuntu as a guest OS? Google for "Virtual server"
2009-01-26T07:52:00.000Z	CoJaBo	wpgmb	What VM software does it install? (Sorry, my question was a bit vague...)
2009-01-26T07:52:00.000Z	wpgmb		CojaBo: couldn't tell you. I don't use that feature
2009-01-26T07:53:00.000Z	wpgmb	MisterKM	Google for: linux create iso from hdd
2009-01-26T07:53:00.000Z	wpgmb	MisterKM	you'll get more to read than you care for
2009-01-26T07:54:00.000Z	CoJaBo	wpgmb	Ok, any suggestion of where it might be documented?
2009-01-26T07:55:00.000Z	wpgmb		CojaBo: many threads on 'buntu forums: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=987631
2009-01-26T07:55:00.000Z	wpgmb		Oops... paste a link - sorry!!!
2009-01-26T07:58:00.000Z	CoJaBo	wpgmb	Problem I'm having is that the name of the option itself is pretty vague lol. Googling "virtual machine host" doesn't get very far. I guess I'll leave it blank and install my own VM host software later.
2009-01-26T07:59:00.000Z	wpgmb		CojaBo: yup. Might want to do that. Does your CPU support VM?
2009-01-26T08:00:00.000Z	CoJaBo	wpgmb	No, its a Celeron, unfortunately :/ so no hardware VM acceleration.
2009-01-26T08:00:00.000Z	wpgmb		CojaBo: then prepare for some painfully slow guest OS...
2009-01-26T08:01:00.000Z	wpgmb		Bryce: Sorry.... that just too funny.... Which Ubuntu distro? Your choices are NOT ubuntu
2009-01-26T08:04:00.000Z	CoJaBo	wpgmb	Hopefully fast enough at least to run a printer/scanner and smartcard reader under XP (Printer and card reader have 0 linux support :/ )
2009-01-26T08:04:00.000Z	wpgmb		CojaBo: I still think you're better off dual booting in that case
2009-01-26T08:06:00.000Z	CoJaBo	wpgmb	Running as a server, so dualbooting isn't really an option. Hopefully it will be supported or I can get it working in Wine later on. The printer/scanner is Lexmark, not sure what the card reader is.
2009-01-26T08:08:00.000Z	wpgmb		CojaBo: Ah. The rock and the hard place. Well - if you don't have a second box for the Windows part. there's only so much you can do.
2009-01-26T08:12:00.000Z	CoJaBo	wpgmb	Have a second system (a laptop currently being used as the server), but hope not to have it running all the time any more. With any luck, I might be able to get the printer and reader working with SANE or Wine or something so I don't need the overhead of an entire VM and Windows XP just to scan something lol
