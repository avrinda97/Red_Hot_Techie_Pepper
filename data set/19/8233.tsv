2007-11-16T21:19:00.000Z	nibsa1242	soundray	you can get a usb-> to serial adapter if you want to use those devices with XP... and possibly Linux
2007-11-16T21:20:00.000Z	soundray	nibsa1242	I know -- but a Thinkpad 240 is a really nice machine. The Asus Eee may be the first real competitor ;)
2007-11-16T21:22:00.000Z	nibsa1242	soundray	don't know about that particular model, but every Thinkpad I've ever used has been a nice solid machine... haven't used one in a few years though
2007-11-16T21:36:00.000Z	soundray	nibsa1242	yes -- dmi3on, best to mount the Ubuntu partition when needed, and unmount it afterwards.
2008-12-11T01:14:00.000Z	soundray	nibsa1242	why do you want to remove them -- do you need the space?
2008-12-11T01:16:00.000Z	nibsa1242	soundray	because I'm having audio issues, and it started around the same time I installed kubuntu-desktop; additonally I never use KDE. Only KDE apps I use are Kate, Konq, and K3b. I can't even use K3b anymore because upgrading to Ibex means the burner on this machine creates coasters.
2008-12-11T01:19:00.000Z	soundray	nibsa1242	I doubt that removing packages will fix the issue, but you could try starting with libarts libraries
2008-12-11T01:19:00.000Z	nibsa1242	soundray	ok, remove or add them?
2008-12-11T01:19:00.000Z	soundray	nibsa1242	remove (artsd is the KDE sound daemon, it causes trouble in rare circumstances)
2008-12-11T01:20:00.000Z	nibsa1242	soundray	ok removing libarts1c2a right now
2008-12-11T01:22:00.000Z	soundray	nibsa1242	generally, if you've removed a metapackage like kubuntu-desktop, it should be possible to remove the dependent packages with 'sudo apt-get autoremove'
2008-12-11T01:22:00.000Z	nibsa1242	soundray	still no sound; still getting W: main.c: setrlimit(RLIMIT_NICE, (31, 31)) failed: Operation not permitted error in pulse audio
2008-12-11T01:23:00.000Z	nibsa1242	soundray	I allowed sudo apt-get autoremove to run.
2008-12-11T01:24:00.000Z	nibsa1242	soundray	sorry the main issues seems to be this W: ltdl-bind-now.c: Failed to find original dlopen loader.
2008-12-11T01:24:00.000Z	soundray	nibsa1242	I doubt whether your problem has anything to do with the KDE packages, but I haven't got any good suggestions (don't let my nick fool you, it's to do with ultrasound rather than audio)
2008-12-11T01:25:00.000Z	nibsa1242	soundray	I didn't think it had anything to do with KDE, but I was hoping. What makes no sense to me is that the live cd had sound. Installed, there was sound, then within a week or two... no sound.
2008-12-11T01:26:00.000Z	nibsa1242	soundray	maybe if I get rid of pulseaudio... what is the best alternative to pulse?
2008-12-11T01:26:00.000Z	soundray	nibsa1242	perhaps the problem is in your user config. Have you tried with a different user?
2008-12-11T01:26:00.000Z	nibsa1242	soundray	I'll go make one and try that. brb
