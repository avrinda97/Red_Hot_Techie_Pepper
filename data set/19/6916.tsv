2007-11-17T05:01:00.000Z	inversekinetix		can someone tell me what KDE is, how to install it and how to enable it please
2007-11-17T05:02:00.000Z	inversekinetix		I think Ill leave KDE alone
2007-11-17T05:03:00.000Z	digitalangel	inversekinetix	KDE is a desktop interface similiar to gnome
2007-11-17T05:03:00.000Z	digitalangel	inversekinetix	synaptic or apt-get will install it with a smiple command
2007-11-17T05:05:00.000Z	inversekinetix	digitalangel	Im looking at the link and it seems that it will install loads of new stuff.  i want to be able to use the Gnome setup I have now as well,  can I switch between them on the sessions menu at login like i can with xfce and gnome
2007-11-17T05:05:00.000Z	digitalangel	inversekinetix	absolutly
2007-11-17T05:05:00.000Z	inversekinetix	digitalangel	Iit wont intefere with or bork anything thats already on here will it?
2007-11-17T05:06:00.000Z	digitalangel	inversekinetix	nope it will act just like another session, there may be a few conflicts but in the end it should be just fine
2007-11-17T05:06:00.000Z	digitalangel	inversekinetix	they actually work realyl well together
2007-11-17T05:06:00.000Z	inversekinetix	digitalangel	what kind of conflicts?
2007-11-17T05:06:00.000Z	digitalangel	inversekinetix	nothing serious maybe a file here or there but it won't mess anything up
2007-11-17T05:08:00.000Z	digitalangel	inversekinetix	no it will be fine, in fact I do that myself with gnome and kde, their quite compatable.  No worries on this one
2007-11-17T05:10:00.000Z	inversekinetix	digitalangel	its downloaded and alm,ost installed now, no turmning back i guess
