2005-04-12T08:48:00.000Z	Xeon3D		I'm going crazy here...
2005-04-12T08:48:00.000Z	Xeon3D		I can mount and umount the /media/setup share... but as soon as I go ls /media/setup it gives me a permission denied error.
2005-04-12T08:49:00.000Z	Tomcat_	Xeon3D	What Filesystem on there?
2005-04-12T08:49:00.000Z	Tomcat_	Xeon3D	Use -O uid=1000,gid=1000 then
2005-04-12T08:49:00.000Z	Tomcat_	Xeon3D	Or something similar for your user...
2005-04-12T08:50:00.000Z	Tomcat_	Xeon3D	Not sure if it matters what the directory has, but the uid/gid setting for mount *always* matters.
2005-04-12T08:50:00.000Z	Tomcat_	Xeon3D	Give me your mount cmdline you're using
2005-04-12T08:51:00.000Z	Tomcat_	Xeon3D	Okay, then add uid=1000,gid=1000 under the options column in fstab... then try to remoun.
2005-04-12T08:52:00.000Z	Tomcat_	Xeon3D	Yeah, just add the uid/gid after that... like user,noauto,uid=...
2005-04-12T08:52:00.000Z	Xeon3D	Tomcat_	thanks it worked... but that was strange.. why can I browse my CD's, etc.. if they haven't got the same uid option?
2005-04-12T08:53:00.000Z	Tomcat_	Xeon3D	Because it's NTFS... wait...
2005-04-12T08:54:00.000Z	Tomcat_	Xeon3D	man mount says for ntfs: "By default, the files are owned by root and not readable by someone else"... that's probably a security measure.
2005-04-12T08:56:00.000Z	Tomcat_	Xeon3D	Because Ubuntu didn't exist. :o
2005-04-12T08:57:00.000Z	Xeon3D	Tomcat_	if you could read portuguese... (my language) you should really try Kurumin...
2005-04-12T08:57:00.000Z	Tomcat_	Xeon3D	The only user capable of reading the files is user 1000 (you) now though... you have to change the uid/gid values to make others access it.
2005-04-12T08:57:00.000Z	Xeon3D	Tomcat_	there should be no problem as I'm the only user with access to the machine.
2005-04-12T08:58:00.000Z	Tomcat_	Xeon3D	If you aren't, find some group that you can put all users in (like group disk, or create a new one) and then edit the gid value.
2005-04-12T08:59:00.000Z	Xeon3D	Tomcat_	... do you happen to know why the Desktop doesn't update automatically? I just created a dummy folder using the terminal, and it didn't show up yet.
2005-04-12T09:00:00.000Z	Tomcat_	Xeon3D	No idea, sorry.
