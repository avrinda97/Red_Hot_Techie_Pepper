2007-05-03T12:49:00.000Z	MSTK	sanityx	- on what programs?  I tried to play some songs and they wouldn't support them, on Feisty.  I would up having to do it  the old Edgy way.
2007-05-03T12:49:00.000Z	sanityx	MSTK	MP3s?
2007-05-03T12:50:00.000Z	sanityx	MSTK	MP3s play fine in Totem, Rhythmbox, Banshee with Feisty's codec installers. Also VLC plays them as well.
2007-05-03T12:50:00.000Z	MSTK	sanityx	- VLC plays everything.  I'm talking about Non-Free codecs such as wmv.
2007-05-03T12:51:00.000Z	sanityx	MSTK	I can play WMV just fine in Totem
2007-05-03T12:52:00.000Z	MSTK	sanityx	- that's odd.  I guess the problem is limited to me, then.
2007-05-03T12:52:00.000Z	sanityx	MSTK	I wouldn't go that far. File a bug report maybe
2007-05-03T12:54:00.000Z	MSTK	sanityx	- basically all I did was plug in my iPod after a fresh reinstall.  rhythmbox auto-loaded and mounted it.  However, non e of the songs would play.  I proceeded to do it "The Edgy Way", as I remembered, and things worked fine.
2007-05-03T12:55:00.000Z	sanityx	MSTK	Interesting. I'm listening to MP3s in banshee right now. Btw, Banshee is far superior to rhythmbox :-D
2007-05-03T12:56:00.000Z	MSTK	sanityx	- I shall.  The reason I initially chose Rhythmbox was because it wouldn't work on my Edgy.  Rhythmbox was the only app  that wouldn't crash.  Maybe with this fresh reinstall fate will deal me a new hand.
2007-05-03T12:57:00.000Z	sanityx	MSTK	Hopefully. I've been using Banshee for 3 days and I'm in love. Its about as close to iTunes as anything in the repositories gets.
2007-05-03T12:57:00.000Z	MSTK	sanityx	- unfortunately, I doubt anything will ever happen soon to satiate my need for a Video iPod updater that supports video  syncing.
2007-05-03T12:58:00.000Z	sanityx	MSTK	Rockbox perhaps?
2007-05-03T12:58:00.000Z	MSTK	sanityx	- rockbox supports video syncing?
2007-05-03T12:58:00.000Z	sanityx	MSTK	Not exactley. Rockbox is open source firmware for the ipod. Perhaps it lets you add videos through drag and drop, like most mp3 players do.
2007-05-03T12:59:00.000Z	sanityx	MSTK	Also I think iPod Linux can play videos,
2007-05-03T13:00:00.000Z	MSTK	sanityx	- I'm sort of looking for an all-in-one solution such as iTunes or Banshee.  I've hyet to give iPod Linux/Rockbox  a try because, last I checked, there was no (relatively) stable video support.
