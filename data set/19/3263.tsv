2012-02-04T13:47:00.000Z	pp7		how do i fix this google-chrome/unity/nvidia driver bug?: http://imgur.com/vu5am
2012-02-04T13:48:00.000Z	theadmin	pp7	Does this always happen? On what pages? Which driver do you use, which Ubuntu version are you on?
2012-02-04T13:48:00.000Z	pp7	theadmin	happen frequently when i open a new page in google chrome, nvidia 290.10, ubuntu 11.10
2012-02-04T13:49:00.000Z	theadmin	pp7	Hm I see... Have you tried alternative new tab pages? Some of them are actually awesome. Might help. If you need the standard one, well, I'd go and ask in #chromium-support
2012-02-04T13:50:00.000Z	pp7	theadmin	what u mean alternative new tab pages?
2012-02-04T13:50:00.000Z	theadmin	pp7	That happens on chrome://newtab, right?
2012-02-04T13:50:00.000Z	pp7	theadmin	hmm no
2012-02-04T13:51:00.000Z	theadmin	pp7	Oh, then it happens on any page?
2012-02-04T13:51:00.000Z	pp7	theadmin	but i can't really reproduce it at will
2012-02-04T13:51:00.000Z	theadmin	pp7	I see... Meh, then I suggest going to #chromium-support, doesn't really sound like an Ubuntu issue unless... you say it only happens in Unity?
2012-02-04T13:51:00.000Z	pp7	theadmin	usually happens when a page causes another tab to open
2012-02-04T13:52:00.000Z	pp7	theadmin	yea never happened to be before in previous ubuntu versions
2012-02-04T13:52:00.000Z	theadmin	pp7	I see, could you install some other lightweight DE and try there? I don't see the real need to keep using Unity
2012-02-04T13:52:00.000Z	theadmin	pp7	I suggest xfce
2012-02-04T13:53:00.000Z	pp7	theadmin	i prefer unity
2012-02-04T13:53:00.000Z	theadmin	pp7	mmmok, does it work in unity2d?
2012-02-04T13:53:00.000Z	pp7		dunno
2012-02-04T13:54:00.000Z	pp7		wouldn't use unity2d anyway
2012-02-04T13:54:00.000Z	theadmin	pp7	Either way, do "ubuntu-bug unity" and report it. Nothing we can really do to help
