2010-02-04T08:54:00.000Z	webbb82		By default, the installer will give you the option to install Ubuntu side by side with whatever operating system is currently on your computer. You can choose that if you want to set up a dual-boot,   i dont get that option when i goto install

2010-02-04T08:50:00.000Z	lucky4linux	webbb82	it depends on the type of installation you choose
2010-02-04T08:50:00.000Z	webbb82	lucky4linux	 how so?
2010-02-04T08:51:00.000Z	lucky4linux	webbb82	in the beginning, the installer will ask you to choose an installation type, how are you gonna install ? Via wubi ?
2010-02-04T08:52:00.000Z	lucky4linux	webbb82	ya but are you installing it from within windows or right frmo system boot up ?

2010-02-04T08:59:00.000Z	lucky4linux	webbb82	ok reboot and check it as i said before
2010-02-04T08:59:00.000Z	lucky4linux	webbb82	no need, we are just checking the CD for defects now. Lets worry about installation and space later !
