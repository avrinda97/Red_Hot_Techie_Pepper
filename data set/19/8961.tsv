2007-01-14T17:48:00.000Z	roxlu		when I want to connect to a samba share of another server, how do I need to connect so I can 'write' files?
2007-01-14T17:49:00.000Z	roxlu		(the permissions in the 'mounted'  directory are not the same as permissions on the server
2007-01-14T17:50:00.000Z	roxlu		adob yeah I know know but I need to mount it on startup and for backup reasons..
2007-01-14T14:25:00.000Z	roxlu		Does someone knows a good "colorpicker" for ubuntu/linux?
2007-01-14T14:25:00.000Z	goodgerster	roxlu	I recommend agave
2007-01-14T14:27:00.000Z	roxlu	goodgerster	thanx! (you're a webdeveloper?)
2007-01-14T14:27:00.000Z	goodgerster	roxlu	er, ya
2007-01-14T14:28:00.000Z	goodgerster	roxlu	yes. there's also a number of firefox plugins which are more specifically geared to colour picking
2007-01-14T14:28:00.000Z	goodgerster	roxlu	but agave does colour scheme generation and such
2007-01-14T14:28:00.000Z	roxlu	goodgerster	oke thanx! which editor do you use?
2007-01-14T14:28:00.000Z	goodgerster	roxlu	I use Bluefish and/or Gedit
2007-01-14T14:29:00.000Z	roxlu	goodgerster	did you use jedit?
2007-01-14T14:29:00.000Z	goodgerster	roxlu	never heard of it
2007-01-14T14:31:00.000Z	roxlu	goodgerster	how can I use agave to select a color from another window?
2007-01-14T14:32:00.000Z	goodgerster	roxlu	use the eyedropper, making sure the colour you want is visible
2007-01-14T14:52:00.000Z	goodgerster	roxlu	GNOME has inbuilt FTP capabilities
2007-01-14T14:59:00.000Z	roxlu	goodgerster	did you ever get a "Bad file handle" while copying a file to a ftp ?
2007-01-14T14:59:00.000Z	goodgerster	roxlu	nope, sorry
