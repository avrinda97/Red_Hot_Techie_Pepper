2007-12-04T22:55:00.000Z	wols	dissident	and what chipset?
2007-12-07T17:42:00.000Z	wols	dissident	why would you when there is ntfs-3g in ubuntu
2007-12-07T17:45:00.000Z	wols	dissident	netfs-3g is in ubuntu, paragon is not
2007-12-07T17:46:00.000Z	wols	dissident	then why do you keep ntfs partitions around?
2007-12-07T17:50:00.000Z	wols	dissident	yes
2007-12-07T17:50:00.000Z	wols	dissident	but why you'd want to creat one I don't know
2007-12-07T17:57:00.000Z	wols	dissident	doesn't make sense. copy the files you want to keep to a backup. format the windows partition. done
2007-12-07T17:58:00.000Z	wols	dissident	all can be done under ubuntu. what you can and should do under windows if you wish is of no concern of this channel. ask ##windows instead
2007-12-07T18:01:00.000Z	wols	dissident	we gave you over time at least 2 ways to read it. and we're vers sure they worked in ubuntu for several versions now
