2010-11-27T21:22:00.000Z	Guest58245		I am in Kde 3.5, I cant figure where to change the default sound card pulse audio uses, any suggestions?
2010-11-27T21:22:00.000Z	crimsun	Guest58245	do you prefer a gui or a command line (Terminal)?
2010-11-27T21:23:00.000Z	Guest58245	crimsun	either one long as it works lol
2010-11-27T21:23:00.000Z	crimsun	Guest58245	then you probably want to install the `pavucontrol` package
2010-11-27T21:24:00.000Z	Guest58245	crimsun	okay the other question is when I set pulse audio to my first sound card, get skype to use my second one...skype only shows the pulse audio local server
2010-11-27T21:26:00.000Z	crimsun	Guest58245	I don't understand; can you take screenshots and explain?
2010-11-27T21:27:00.000Z	Guest58245	crimsun	when I use skype and go to the audio tab the only cards listed in there says Pulse Audio Local Server, it doesnt give me the option of picking a sound card. I want to setup so like all my sounds, music, youtube videos, etc come through my first sound card, but skype goes through my second
2010-11-27T21:28:00.000Z	crimsun	Guest58245	which version of Skype are you using?
2010-11-27T21:29:00.000Z	Guest58245	crimsun	the latest from skype.com so skype something beta 2
2010-11-27T21:29:00.000Z	crimsun	Guest58245	E.g., I'm using 2.1.0.81-1ubuntu5 from the partner repository.
2010-11-27T21:29:00.000Z	Guest58245	crimsun	it says ubuntu-intrepid_2.1.0.81-1
2010-11-27T21:30:00.000Z	crimsun	Guest58245	are you still on Intrepid?
2010-11-27T21:30:00.000Z	Guest58245	crimsun	no it was the only one I could find on Skypes website I am on maverick running kde 3.5
2010-11-27T21:31:00.000Z	crimsun	Guest58245	ah, well, for reference, it's also in the Canonical partner repository.
2010-11-27T21:31:00.000Z	Guest58245	crimsun	oh okay i didnt know that lol
2010-11-27T21:32:00.000Z	Guest58245	crimsun	nvm I got it working using that pavucontrol ty now I just have to fix my firefox problem lol
2010-11-27T21:32:00.000Z	crimsun	Guest58245	anyhow, the fact that you only see PulseAudio server (local) is expected.
2010-11-27T21:33:00.000Z	Guest58245	crimsun	can i ask you the firefox question?
2010-11-27T21:33:00.000Z	crimsun	Guest58245	I'm not really good at troubleshooting FF issues.
