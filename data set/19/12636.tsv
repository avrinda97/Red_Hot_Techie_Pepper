2006-01-19T06:48:00.000Z	Kovecses	Moratorium	^^^^
2006-01-19T06:48:00.000Z	Kovecses	Moratorium	very easy
2006-01-19T06:50:00.000Z	Kovecses	Moratorium	once you install ubuntu in thoery you will never have to again... so no you just need an internet connection
2006-01-19T06:51:00.000Z	Kovecses	Moratorium	why not?
2006-01-19T06:53:00.000Z	Kovecses	Moratorium	its synaptic
2006-01-19T06:54:00.000Z	Kovecses	Moratorium	so your mouse dont work??? thats odd
2006-01-19T06:56:00.000Z	Kovecses	Moratorium	really? now thats really strange.... if you go into your livecd and put your xorg.conf onto like a floppy or thumb drive then install ubuntu and use the saved one ... or just look at the differences it may work
2006-01-19T06:56:00.000Z	Kovecses	Moratorium	i think so
2006-01-19T06:57:00.000Z	Kovecses	Moratorium	are you familiar with linux?
