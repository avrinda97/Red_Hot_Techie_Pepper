2009-05-16T08:20:00.000Z	Piet	Decepticon	the list of installed packages is also in /var, this is something you'd want for sure

2009-05-18T18:21:00.000Z	Piet	Decepticon	iowait=Amount of time the CPU has been waiting for I/O to complete.
2009-05-18T18:22:00.000Z	Decepticon	Piet	so my disk is being slow in read/write?
2009-05-18T18:22:00.000Z	Piet	Decepticon	yes it can be your disks.
2009-05-18T18:22:00.000Z	Decepticon	Piet	if the disk is being slow, why wont it just queue the disk i/o operations and forget about it until its ready instead of hogging CPU
2009-05-18T18:25:00.000Z	Piet	Decepticon	I assume that since cpu can not offload i/o data quickly enough it gets under high load.
