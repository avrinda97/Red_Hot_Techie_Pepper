2007-04-22T07:55:00.000Z	Fujitsu	blazemonger	MIDI is a touchy issue, unfortunately.
2007-04-22T07:56:00.000Z	blazemonger	Fujitsu	well i would pay someone for a computer which has everything i need for midi
2007-12-23T17:44:00.000Z	Fujitsu	blazemonger	I haven't seen such a problem on any of the systems I touch - and that's a lot.
2007-12-23T17:45:00.000Z	Fujitsu	blazemonger	I've no idea.
2007-12-23T17:52:00.000Z	Fujitsu	blazemonger	I'm failing to see the install error in Ubuntu here.
2007-12-23T18:12:00.000Z	Fujitsu	blazemonger	What is wrong with Rosegarden on Ubuntu?
2007-12-23T18:16:00.000Z	Fujitsu	blazemonger	I've no idea.
2007-12-23T18:16:00.000Z	Fujitsu	blazemonger	Is the error causing any issues other than excessive terminal output during upgrades?
2007-12-23T18:19:00.000Z	Fujitsu	blazemonger	It's not a bug in libpng.
2007-12-23T18:19:00.000Z	Fujitsu	blazemonger	There are more than 20,000 packages in Ubuntu. Each developer doesn't know every one.
2007-12-23T18:22:00.000Z	Fujitsu	blazemonger	If you have the license physically stuck to your computer case, yes.
2007-12-23T18:22:00.000Z	Fujitsu	blazemonger	I'm not sure about downloading it from a torrent site, but using a friend's media shouldn't be problematic, nor detectable.
2007-12-23T18:25:00.000Z	blazemonger	Fujitsu	+ i wont be using windows for online use ill use ubuntu for my digital grafiti art+album art and windows for logic audio+studio work
