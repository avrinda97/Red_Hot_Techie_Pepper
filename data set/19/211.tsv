2012-06-21T13:21:00.000Z	the_josh		Guys, I have downloaded nvidia's new driver for ubuntu with "apt-get install nvidia-current nvidia-settings"
2012-06-21T13:21:00.000Z	the_josh		I also rebooted
2012-06-21T13:21:00.000Z	the_josh		But it dosn't seems I can increase resolution or anything
2012-06-21T13:21:00.000Z	the_josh		so, heh, I am stucked here
2012-06-21T13:21:00.000Z	the_josh		anything I can do ?
2012-06-21T13:21:00.000Z	terminhell	the_josh	what does xrandr report for resolutions?
2012-06-21T13:22:00.000Z	the_josh	terminhell	xrandr ?
2012-06-21T13:22:00.000Z	terminhell	the_josh	yea, its a command
2012-06-21T13:25:00.000Z	the_josh	terminhell	Well, xrandr tells me my current resolution
2012-06-21T13:26:00.000Z	the_josh	terminhell	Which is 800x600
2012-06-21T13:26:00.000Z	terminhell	the_josh	does it list other resolutions?
2012-06-21T13:27:00.000Z	terminhell	the_josh	also, have you rebooted after installing the driver?
2012-06-21T13:31:00.000Z	the_josh	terminhell	Aye sir
2012-06-21T13:31:00.000Z	the_josh	terminhell	And it dosn't list other resolutions
2012-06-21T13:33:00.000Z	terminhell	the_josh	does your card come up with lspci?
2012-06-21T13:37:00.000Z	the_josh	terminhell	Aye sir
2012-06-21T13:37:00.000Z	the_josh	terminhell	If you are doubting that, it is properly connected or not, then I must tell you I have windows as second OS and I have it perfectly working in there
2012-06-21T13:38:00.000Z	the_josh	terminhell	Any clue ?
2012-06-21T13:38:00.000Z	terminhell	the_josh	not doubting the physical install, just seems that the driver isn't loading properly. You may have to blacklist another default vid driver?
