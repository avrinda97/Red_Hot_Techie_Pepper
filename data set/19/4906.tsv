2008-10-13T10:51:00.000Z	drowner		Guys - little help
2008-10-13T10:51:00.000Z	drowner		I have my music library split between 2 hard drives, one internal and one external connnected via USB
2008-10-13T10:52:00.000Z	drowner		so, what I want to do is to mount one of the partitions on my external drive into ~/Music/linux-music
2008-10-13T10:52:00.000Z	drowner		when it gets plugged in
2008-10-13T10:52:00.000Z	EvilTchnlgy_	drowner	go on

2008-10-13T11:07:00.000Z	drowner	EvilTchnlgy_	It's gotten worse
2008-10-13T11:09:00.000Z	EvilTchnlgy_	drowner	don't worry i haven't forgotten about you =0
2008-10-13T11:16:00.000Z	drowner	EvilTchnlgy_	update: I used gconfeditor to remove the label I made, and am now able to mount it. Not where i want though. I don't actually know if its possible
2008-10-13T11:17:00.000Z	EvilTchnlgy_	drowner	where ARE you trying yto mount it again?
2008-10-13T11:19:00.000Z	EvilTchnlgy_	drowner	why not try mounting it to /media/linux-music
2008-10-13T11:19:00.000Z	drowner	EvilTchnlgy_	I could do that!
2008-10-13T11:22:00.000Z	EvilTchnlgy_	drowner	what is the error you try to get when you mount?
2008-10-13T11:23:00.000Z	drowner	EvilTchnlgy_	I've got it to mount now. It's a known 'bug' - if you put a / in the mountpoint, it can't mount. You can only specify a mountpoint like 'chicken', in which case it will mount to /media/chicken
2008-10-13T11:24:00.000Z	EvilTchnlgy_	drowner	ahh thank you. learned something new =)
2008-10-13T11:29:00.000Z	drowner	EvilTchnlgy_	Thx for your help. I don't actually know if this is possible, but i'll keep working at it.
