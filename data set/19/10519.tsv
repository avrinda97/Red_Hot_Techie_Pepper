2011-01-27T04:27:00.000Z	gibbster		Hey guys. Ubuntu software center (and other gui apps) aren't accepting my password. Any idea about what's going on?
2011-01-27T04:28:00.000Z	bobobo	gibbster	Lock CAPS on?
2011-01-27T04:28:00.000Z	gibbster	bobobo	nope. I can sudo in a terminal right after
2011-01-27T04:28:00.000Z	bobobo		Sinaptics? Another instance of software center already opened?
2011-01-27T04:28:00.000Z	gibbster	bobobo	just restarted
2011-01-27T04:29:00.000Z	bobobo	gibbster	then I really don't know :)
2011-01-27T04:29:00.000Z	gibbster		it's really weird
2011-01-27T04:31:00.000Z	gibbster	bobobo	I got around it by doing sudo software-center
2011-01-27T04:31:00.000Z	gibbster	bobobo	but that's a workaround, not a solution
2011-01-27T04:33:00.000Z	bobobo	gibbster	that's odd, what version are you using?
2011-01-27T04:33:00.000Z	gibbster	bobobo	10.10
2011-01-27T04:33:00.000Z	gibbster	bobobo	I upgraded to the desktop from the server version though
2011-01-27T04:33:00.000Z	gibbster	bobobo	maybe that has something to do with it
2011-01-27T04:34:00.000Z	bobobo		peraphs
2011-01-27T04:35:00.000Z	bobobo	gibbster	are you skilled on the server?
2011-01-27T04:35:00.000Z	gibbster	bobobo	yeah. not bad. but there a few times when gnome is useful
2011-01-27T04:36:00.000Z	bobobo	gibbster	do you know bu chance how to change the terminal background color from the bashrc?
2011-01-27T04:37:00.000Z	gibbster	bobobo	no sorry. not something I particularly care about
2011-01-27T04:38:00.000Z	bobobo	gibbster	ok :)
