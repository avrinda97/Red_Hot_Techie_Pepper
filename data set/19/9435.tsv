2009-11-16T02:27:00.000Z	prodigel		hi all. You guys know a nice GUI app for that converts videos from one format/codec to another? I know ther's mencoder, and I have nothing against console, but I would like something easier
2009-11-16T02:28:00.000Z	Jordan_U	prodigel	handbrake is one
2009-11-16T02:29:00.000Z	Jordan_U	prodigel	There is also arista and transmageddon
2009-11-16T02:31:00.000Z	prodigel	Jordan_U	thanks, I'll give them a try. do you have a favorite one?
2009-11-16T02:33:00.000Z	Jordan_U	prodigel	I've only actually tried handbrake
2009-11-16T02:36:00.000Z	prodigel	Jordan_U	one more thing... I can't find the package with apt cache-search (handbrake I mean). Does it require a custom repository?
2010-05-23T15:03:00.000Z	Jordan_U	prodigel	You can use badram from grub2, which passes the information on to the kernel. The syntax for specifying bad blocks is exactly the same as with the linux kernel parameter.
2010-05-23T15:04:00.000Z	prodigel	Jordan_U	I saw that. But is badram included in the current kernel releases by default, or I need to patch/compile it?
2010-05-23T15:05:00.000Z	Jordan_U	prodigel	I don't think that grub2's badram depends on any kernel patches.
2010-05-23T16:07:00.000Z	prodigel	Jordan_U	I don't remember exactly if you suggested grub2 for badram or not, I figured that if you are that person, maybe you know what addr1,mask1[addr2,mask2] exactly means. Also I don't know where in the booting commands list to insert my badram command. Thanks
2010-05-23T16:14:00.000Z	Jordan_U	prodigel	You can get the error patterns from memtest86+ by pressing 'c' for configuration then '4' for error report mode, then '3' for "BadRAM Patterns"
2010-05-23T16:15:00.000Z	prodigel	Jordan_U	Thanks! I'll check it out.
2010-05-23T16:16:00.000Z	Jordan_U	prodigel	You're welcome.
2012-05-26T02:10:00.000Z	Jordan_U	prodigel	Can you pastebin the output of "sudo parted -l"?
2012-05-26T02:16:00.000Z	Jordan_U	prodigel	The starting sector for sda7 is 2,941,963,786 but your drive only has 976,773,168 sectors.
2012-05-26T02:17:00.000Z	prodigel	Jordan_U	the windows partition manager probably f**ed it up. I saw something strange looking there, but I continued on it, as I couldn't do more about it
2012-05-26T02:17:00.000Z	Jordan_U	prodigel	Please watch your language, obfuscated or otherwise,
2012-05-26T02:18:00.000Z	prodigel	Jordan_U	sorry about that
2012-05-26T02:19:00.000Z	Jordan_U	prodigel	Try the utility "fixparts". It's good at figuring out how things actually should be. If it can't get you to a state where all your partitions are readable try testdisk as well (which can search your drive to find where filesystems start/end and create a new partition table based on that information).
