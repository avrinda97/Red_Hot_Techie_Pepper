2005-09-21T12:15:00.000Z	kaelisra		thankies, well, i'm not entirely sure, as yet, what's wrong. breezy solved the fact that the driver wasn't there, but..  still, no sound, whatsoever

2005-09-21T12:21:00.000Z	crimsun	kaelisra	the ALC880 is a complete headache
2005-09-21T12:22:00.000Z	kaelisra	crimsun	 strange thing is, it has always claimed it was a intel high definition audio sound card.
2005-09-21T12:22:00.000Z	crimsun	kaelisra	it is.
2005-09-21T12:22:00.000Z	kaelisra	crimsun	oh, ok.
2005-09-21T12:22:00.000Z	crimsun	kaelisra	there seems to be very, very screwed up interaction between what the BIOS is reporting for the actual registers and what the driver can detect
2005-09-21T12:23:00.000Z	crimsun	kaelisra	as you can read in #15031

2005-09-21T12:24:00.000Z	crimsun	kaelisra	well, the kernel panic has been resolved, but the amp channels are causing a problem; they're basically throwing the init into an infinite loop
2005-09-21T12:26:00.000Z	kaelisra	crimsun	thanks, anyways, for the help.
