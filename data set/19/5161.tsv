2008-08-31T18:43:00.000Z	Theaxiom_		I am going to scream, I have been trying to get vnc to work on ubuntu for 4 hours now. Every time I try to connect to tightvnc, it asks for the password, then I click ok and it says connection closed. Any ideas whats going on?
2008-08-31T18:44:00.000Z	Theaxiom_		I am seriously going to blow up my computer, anyone know how to get VNC working on ubuntu?
2008-08-31T18:46:00.000Z	starenka	Theaxiom_	why dont you use desktop sharing or ssh?
2008-08-31T18:46:00.000Z	Theaxiom_	starenka	The other person only has windows
2008-08-31T18:47:00.000Z	starenka	Theaxiom_	desktop sharing works with vnc...
2008-08-31T18:47:00.000Z	Theaxiom_	starenka	How do I do that? Vino?
2008-08-31T18:47:00.000Z	starenka	Theaxiom_	well, at leat krdc in KDE does

2008-08-31T18:53:00.000Z	starenka	Theaxiom_	btw you can access ssh from windoze machina w/ putty
2008-08-31T18:54:00.000Z	Theaxiom_	starenka	I am trying to show clients stuff on my desktop while talking on skype
2008-08-31T18:54:00.000Z	Theaxiom_	starenka	he has raw ports blocked on his machine, how do I configure it for a different port?
2008-08-31T18:55:00.000Z	starenka	Theaxiom_	ohkay, but desktop sharing works, like a charm (well not for watching movies, of coarse) in KDE, so i guess vino will serve same way in gnome
2008-08-31T18:55:00.000Z	Theaxiom_	starenka	So how do I change it to a different port?
2008-08-31T18:56:00.000Z	starenka	Theaxiom_	dunno, but you can port forward on router meanwhile :))
2008-08-31T18:56:00.000Z	Theaxiom_	starenka	thanks

2008-08-31T18:57:00.000Z	Theaxiom_	starenka	Thanks
2008-08-31T18:59:00.000Z	starenka	Theaxiom_	so vino is not working, then? you got 5900 or other opened?
2008-08-31T18:59:00.000Z	starenka	Theaxiom_	try to scan the ports with nmap or so
