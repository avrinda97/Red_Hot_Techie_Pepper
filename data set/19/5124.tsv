2010-10-16T07:34:00.000Z	miststlkr		quick question if anyone is around to help .  using regexp to bulk rename files and hitting a wall.  what is the "any number of characters" combination?  [.]* ?  for example, I used the regexp to insert a hyphen befre and after the sections I want removed, thinking it would be easy to then remove everything between them using something like 's/-.{*}-//'  but not so much... I'm screwiong up the .* portion, I'm sure of it...
2010-10-16T07:35:00.000Z	leo_rockway	miststlkr	escape the dot
2010-10-16T07:36:00.000Z	leo_rockway	miststlkr	.* doesn't work?
2010-10-16T07:37:00.000Z	leo_rockway	miststlkr	.* works in vi, that's why I asked.
2010-10-16T07:39:00.000Z	leo_rockway	miststlkr	give me an example string so I can try.
2010-10-16T07:40:00.000Z	leo_rockway	miststlkr	no, if you escape the period then it's actually a period and not a "any char" character. I thought you were replacing periods at first, thats why I suggested escaping.
2010-10-16T07:43:00.000Z	leo_rockway	miststlkr	yeah s/-.*-// works in vi. I don't know what the batch rename thing is doing for you.
2010-10-16T07:47:00.000Z	leo_rockway	miststlkr	it's okay, haha.
2010-10-16T07:54:00.000Z	leo_rockway	miststlkr	are you writing your script or using some batch renaming app?
2010-10-16T07:55:00.000Z	leo_rockway	miststlkr	huh... I didn't know that command. Let me see it.
2010-10-16T07:57:00.000Z	leo_rockway	miststlkr	the man says rename .AVI *.avi though
2010-10-16T07:58:00.000Z	leo_rockway	miststlkr	the regex-fu is not strong in me either.
2010-10-16T07:59:00.000Z	leo_rockway	miststlkr	I know using 2 regex and two for loops is not efficient, but does it work for you?
2010-10-16T08:00:00.000Z	leo_rockway	miststlkr	tab autocompletes nicks... if you call me roackaway my client doesn't highlight what you say to me.
2010-10-16T08:01:00.000Z	leo_rockway	miststlkr	http://regularexpressions.info <--- good site.
2010-10-16T08:01:00.000Z	leo_rockway	miststlkr	keep in mind that everyone uses different implementations of regex. Python's regex aren't exactly the same as perl regex, for instance.
2010-10-16T08:02:00.000Z	leo_rockway	miststlkr	I use Konversation, because I'm in KDE. Maybe you could try X-Chat.
2010-10-16T08:03:00.000Z	leo_rockway	miststlkr	Perl's is the most widespread, I think.
2010-10-16T08:05:00.000Z	leo_rockway	miststlkr	yup, no problem.
