2006-07-12T16:09:00.000Z	`Evil`		Anyone know how to run a force-check for disk errors in Ubuntu Dapper?
2006-07-12T16:11:00.000Z	roshan_s	`Evil`	Look at dosfsck
2006-07-12T16:11:00.000Z	`Evil`	roshan_s	thanks
2006-07-12T16:59:00.000Z	roshan_s	`Evil`	What is the problem?
2006-07-12T16:59:00.000Z	`Evil`	roshan_s	when i type dosfsck -a -r /dev/hda5 (for any drive) i get this error
2006-07-12T05:01:00.000Z	roshan_s	`Evil`	Is the partition otherwise fine?
2006-07-12T05:01:00.000Z	`Evil`	roshan_s	Yes. All the partitions are giving this msg
2006-07-12T05:02:00.000Z	roshan_s	`Evil`	Did you run e2fsck on the drive by mistake?
2006-07-12T05:03:00.000Z	`Evil`	roshan_s	No. I ran man e2fsckand checked was for ext03 so ran dosfsck then
2006-07-12T05:05:00.000Z	`Evil`	roshan_s	XP is there on 2nd hdd primary part and boots fine. The prob is ubuntu Every time says error and boots on startup
2006-07-12T05:05:00.000Z	`Evil`	roshan_s	While windows doesnt give any error in same parts
2006-07-12T05:05:00.000Z	`Evil`	roshan_s	and Ubuntu takes about 15min on startup eachtime to check
2006-07-12T05:06:00.000Z	roshan_s	`Evil`	The Ubuntu errors are on the FAT partitions? Have you tried running the Windows scandisk tool or whatever they have nowadays?
2006-07-12T05:06:00.000Z	`Evil`	roshan_s	Yep. They're in FAT32. Tried almost every tool. Noone gives any error
2006-07-12T05:07:00.000Z	roshan_s	`Evil`	An easy way out is to not have Ubuntu check your DOS partitions on boot, since Windows will scan those partitions. There's nothing really wrong with those partitions anyhow
2006-07-12T05:08:00.000Z	`Evil`	roshan_s	Ok, Cool. How do I then make Ubuntu not check disks on boot?
2006-07-12T05:10:00.000Z	`Evil`	roshan_s	k thanks. will try that
2006-07-12T05:12:00.000Z	`Evil`	roshan_s	Can i pvt msg you the entries in the file?
2006-07-12T05:12:00.000Z	roshan_s	`Evil`	Sure
