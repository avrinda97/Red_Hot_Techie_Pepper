2006-10-03T15:14:00.000Z	nightripe	v3rt3x	i can see 3 partitions on my computer
2006-10-03T15:14:00.000Z	v3rt3x	nightripe	first of all, you are not going to be able to use sata fakeraid on linux
2006-10-03T15:14:00.000Z	v3rt3x	nightripe	turn raid off in the bios
2006-10-03T15:15:00.000Z	v3rt3x	nightripe	put the cd in, pick your disk and go
2006-10-03T15:15:00.000Z	nightripe	v3rt3x	ok  ...i'm going to turn off raid system.....
2006-10-03T15:16:00.000Z	nightripe	v3rt3x	 but, can i install ubuntu on 1 sata disk ?
2006-10-03T15:16:00.000Z	v3rt3x	nightripe	yes, just specify during installation
2006-10-03T15:17:00.000Z	nightripe	v3rt3x	ok i m going to see that
2006-10-03T15:20:00.000Z	nightripe	v3rt3x	when i turn off raid system..i can boot on my cd......
2006-10-03T15:21:00.000Z	v3rt3x	nightripe	doesn't sound good
2006-10-03T15:21:00.000Z	nightripe	v3rt3x	 but if i configure bios to start with IDE hdd    is booting......but i dont want to IDE is the master :-(
2006-10-03T15:22:00.000Z	v3rt3x	nightripe	that is a secondary issue. you need to focus on your cdrom issue
