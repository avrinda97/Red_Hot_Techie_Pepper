2012-01-26T01:50:00.000Z	tado		is there anyone that understand how temperatures and the laptop fan work? mine seems to be constantly running...
2012-01-26T01:51:00.000Z	lagbox	tado	you might have your processor set at maximum speed
2012-01-26T01:51:00.000Z	lagbox	tado	get a cpu frequency scaling applet
2012-01-26T01:52:00.000Z	tado	lagbox	how can i check that? or edit it, for that sake... it seems like there are two temperatures that sensors receive that are keeping the fan on. can i try and pastebin the output for you?
2012-01-26T01:53:00.000Z	lagbox	tado	are you using gnome or unity ?
2012-01-26T01:54:00.000Z	tado	lagbox	unity, freshly installed on my new lenovo E320
2012-01-26T01:54:00.000Z	lagbox	tado	... search the software center for cpu frequency ... and sometimes temperatures are not reported correctly
2012-01-26T01:55:00.000Z	lagbox	tado	but i would imagine that the fans are controlled on the bios level not the OS level, but that is my assumption
2012-01-26T01:58:00.000Z	tado	lagbox	are they? it seems that with thinkfan i can edit when they should kick in, and that since 55 C is the temperature where it does start, the fact that sensors perceive a 57 out of what they check keeps it on all the time
2012-01-26T01:58:00.000Z	tado	lagbox	http://paste.ubuntu.com/816962/
2012-01-26T01:59:00.000Z	tado	lagbox	and this is thinkfan's output: http://paste.ubuntu.com/816973/
2012-01-26T02:01:00.000Z	lagbox	tado	 looks like that does not provide fan control ... and i personaly would not mess with fan settings ... you may want to adjust the frequency of the cpu to bring the temperature down when you don't need performance
2012-01-26T02:02:00.000Z	tado	lagbox	alright... do you know what i should look for in the BIOS to avoid making a mess?
2012-01-26T02:02:00.000Z	lagbox	tado	... apparently it isn't at the bios level though .... is your processor running at full speed all the time ?
2012-01-26T02:03:00.000Z	tado	lagbox	no. it's running at about 8%
2012-01-26T02:05:00.000Z	lagbox	tado	interesting .. i would start going through the forums ... i would bet ibm has some good support for ubuntu and linux
2012-01-26T02:05:00.000Z	tado	lagbox	couldn't find much till now... but thanks for helping anyway
2012-01-26T02:06:00.000Z	lagbox	tado	sorry i don't know more about that ... good luck in the hunt
2012-01-26T02:06:00.000Z	tado	lagbox	;)
