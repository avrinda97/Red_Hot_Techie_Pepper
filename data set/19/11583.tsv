2006-03-02T13:34:00.000Z	calc		my dad's athlon runs at something like 80C
2006-03-02T13:34:00.000Z	calc		but his is the original athlon xp model so it ran hotter than newer ones
2006-03-02T13:34:00.000Z	calc		not xp-m
2006-03-02T13:34:00.000Z	calc		palomino iirc
2006-03-02T13:35:00.000Z	calc		if your cpu isn't crashing it is probably ok regardless of the temp it is running at
2006-03-02T13:35:00.000Z	calc		its about 4-5 years old now
2006-03-02T13:35:00.000Z	calc		its an original athlon xp 1800
2006-03-02T13:36:00.000Z	calc		from iirc ~ oct 2001
2006-03-02T13:36:00.000Z	calc		heh
2006-03-02T13:36:00.000Z	calc		wikipedia note: "The "Palomino" did have one major flaw, however: it ran very hot."
2006-03-02T13:36:00.000Z	vivid	calc	the models that ran hot were the athlon thunderbirds, and previous
2006-03-02T13:41:00.000Z	calc	vivid	160F? 160C would be quite hot
2006-03-02T13:42:00.000Z	vivid	calc	if they maxed at 30 degrees at normal temp, they would overheat every summer
2006-03-02T13:42:00.000Z	calc	vivid	i think you are getting your C and F reversed
2006-03-02T13:46:00.000Z	vivid	calc	whats closer 90-160 c or 160-300f
2006-03-02T13:47:00.000Z	calc	vivid	but not typically desktop chips
2006-03-02T13:48:00.000Z	vivid	calc	either way, unless you dont have a heatsink on it, your very unlikely to damage it with heat, as with improper voltage/fsb/clock settings
2006-03-02T13:48:00.000Z	calc	vivid	true
2006-03-02T13:50:00.000Z	calc	vivid	pcix != pcie
