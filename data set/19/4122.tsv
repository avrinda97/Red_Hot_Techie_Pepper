2009-04-21T13:33:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	noiz	you probably burned it wrong, what application are you using to burn?
2009-04-21T13:35:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	noiz	you cannot just burn the iso to a cd/dvd, you need to burn the iso, usually there are some menus somewehere that say burn iso, but where to find that depends on the application...
2009-04-21T13:35:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	noiz	if you are on linux use gnomebaker, go to tools and click on burn cd iso
2009-04-21T13:36:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	noiz	and basicall what Petfrogg said
2009-04-21T13:37:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	noiz	if it doesnt boot on system startup you probably have your boot device priority messed up in bios
2009-04-21T13:38:00.000Z	noiz	remoteCTRL1	im dumb but not that dumb, i set cd dvd on first.
2009-04-21T13:38:00.000Z	noiz	remoteCTRL1	then there was - and then it asked "press any key to boot from cd" i pressed alot of keys nothing happened and after that it started to boot the kernel already.
2009-04-21T13:39:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	noiz	well if the iso mounts and you have your bios setup straight what else reason could there be for it not to boot?
2009-04-21T13:39:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	noiz	usb keyboard?
2009-04-21T13:39:00.000Z	noiz	remoteCTRL1	yes
2009-04-21T13:39:00.000Z	noiz	remoteCTRL1	i think i have one not usb one
