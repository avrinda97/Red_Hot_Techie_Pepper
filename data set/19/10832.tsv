2006-05-11T16:38:00.000Z	RandolphCarter		do you see the freebsd one first?
2006-05-11T16:38:00.000Z	RandolphCarter		using scsi or ide drives?
2006-05-11T16:40:00.000Z	RandolphCarter		probably easier to get a dos disk and do fdisk /mbr :)
2006-05-11T16:40:00.000Z	RandolphCarter		make sure the linux partition's marked as 'active' though
2006-05-11T16:41:00.000Z	RandolphCarter		no, no, in the partition table
2006-05-11T16:41:00.000Z	eXistenZ	RandolphCarter	When I opened a folder which has like 3000 picture in the file manager, my computer stopped responding. How can I fix that?
2006-05-11T16:42:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	eXistenZ	go into the file browser and select Edit-Preferences
2006-05-11T16:42:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	eXistenZ	on the Preview tab, you can select 'Show thumbnails': 'never'
2006-05-11T16:43:00.000Z	eXistenZ	RandolphCarter	thanks
2006-05-11T16:43:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	eXistenZ	np's :)
2006-05-11T16:44:00.000Z	eXistenZ	RandolphCarter	the default "image viewer" sucks in gnome
2006-05-11T16:46:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	eXistenZ	never really noticed a problem, but you could always use Synaptic to get another
2006-05-11T16:46:00.000Z	eXistenZ	RandolphCarter	what email client do you use?
2006-05-11T16:47:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	eXistenZ	evolution (I use the groupware stuff at work)
2006-05-11T16:48:00.000Z	eXistenZ	RandolphCarter	is it better than Thunderbird?
2006-05-11T16:48:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	eXistenZ	'better', in these regards, is always highly subjective :) (use whichever you prefer)
2006-05-11T16:49:00.000Z	eXistenZ	RandolphCarter	What RSS aggregator do you use?
2006-05-11T16:49:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	eXistenZ	I don't :)
2006-05-11T16:50:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	eXistenZ	probably should sometime, but it's not like I visit 50+ sites often anyway
