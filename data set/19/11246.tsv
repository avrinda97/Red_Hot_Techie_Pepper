2006-03-04T09:00:00.000Z	Seyekoh		I have an Asus A7N8X Deluxe nForce2 chipset (Realtek integrated audio)...  I cannot get any audio working.  Anybody have any suggestions?

2006-03-04T09:01:00.000Z	Seyekoh	cafuego	i guess i did ask for suggestions... =/
2006-03-04T16:17:00.000Z	cafuego	Seyekoh	My recommendation stands.
2006-03-04T16:18:00.000Z	Seyekoh	cafuego	lol, thanks man.
2006-03-04T16:18:00.000Z	Seyekoh	cafuego	i thought the point of linux was open source, free, and anti M$
2006-03-04T16:18:00.000Z	Seyekoh	cafuego	speakers work in winblows
2006-03-04T16:19:00.000Z	cafuego	Seyekoh	Yeh, but my recommendation didn't involve windows
2006-03-04T16:20:00.000Z	Seyekoh	cafuego	true, but it involved NOT-free...
2006-03-04T16:26:00.000Z	Seyekoh	cafuego	so, other than your primary recommendation, do you have any others that involve changing my system config?
2006-03-04T16:27:00.000Z	cafuego	Seyekoh	None at this stage; like I said: I haven't ever had speakers plugged into my nforce2 system (it's servering and runs with only power & ethernet)
2006-03-04T16:28:00.000Z	Seyekoh	cafuego	yeah, that is how my server has been as well.  Just trying to convert the main system, and it is rough so far
2006-03-04T16:30:00.000Z	cafuego	Seyekoh	And as it turns out, it looks like the nforce2 system does NOT have a realtek audio chip.
2006-03-04T16:30:00.000Z	cafuego	Seyekoh	What does yours say about 'lspci | grep audio' ?
2006-03-04T16:30:00.000Z	Seyekoh	cafuego	not according to my manual
2006-03-04T16:31:00.000Z	Seyekoh	cafuego	0000:00:05.0 Multimedia audio controller: nVidia Corporation nForce MultiMedia audio [Via VT82C686B]  (rev a2)
2006-03-04T16:32:00.000Z	cafuego	Seyekoh	Mine's " nVidia Corporation MCP2S AC'97 Audio Controller (rev a1)" and that uses the 'snd-intel8x0' driver. No realtek
2006-03-04T16:34:00.000Z	Seyekoh	cafuego	yeah, manual specifications: Realtek ALC650 6CH with built-in HP amplifier integrated APU (Deluxe model only) SoundStorm / Dolby Digital (AC-3) Encoder (Deluxe Model Only)
2006-03-04T16:36:00.000Z	cafuego	Seyekoh	Must be marginally different from mine then.
