2008-08-04T19:29:00.000Z	ogzy		i have plugged a usb bluettoh dongle to my laptop which has hardy installed, i am able to send file using the tray icon and scan the devices but when i scan from my mobile phone i am not able to detect my laptop device, any one had the same problem ?

2008-08-04T19:32:00.000Z	ogzy	bytecode	i had changed it but didnt worked
2008-08-04T19:33:00.000Z	bytecode	ogzy	have you confirmed that blue tooth is working / service is running correctly by say, using the system tray -> browse device option to see if it can discover your devices?
2008-08-04T19:34:00.000Z	ogzy	bytecode	bluetooth is running and usb dongle is able to scan and find my mobile also able to connect
2008-08-04T19:35:00.000Z	bytecode	ogzy	but just not able to send a file from the device?
2008-08-04T19:36:00.000Z	ogzy	bytecode	i am able to scan and detect my mobile from laptop using dongle, but when i scan from mobile no bluetooth device is found
2008-08-04T19:37:00.000Z	bytecode	ogzy	that's odd - the only thing that I can think of is that the adapter just isn't visible - but if it's showing as "visible and connectable" then it should be. have you tried toggling the discoverability, or testing out the "limited discoverable" mode for comparison?
2008-08-04T19:38:00.000Z	ogzy	bytecode	yes i toggled the options, still not able to detect the dongle
2008-08-04T19:38:00.000Z	bytecode	ogzy	which services are you running? ( bluetooh preferences -> services tab)
2008-08-04T19:39:00.000Z	ogzy	bytecode	audio and input
2008-08-04T19:40:00.000Z	bytecode	ogzy	same as my settings... I would normally expect you to be able to scan for your computer via your device and see it's name, suffixed by the adapter number (0,1,2 etc depending upon how many adaptors are present - count is from 0)
2008-08-04T19:41:00.000Z	ogzy	bytecode	i expect the same thing but it i snot working thats why i am here :)
2008-08-04T19:43:00.000Z	bytecode	ogzy	lol - ok, maybe check which packages you have installed, have you checked out the guide at: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BluetoothSetup
2008-08-04T19:44:00.000Z	ogzy	bytecode	i have already read it
2008-08-04T19:48:00.000Z	bytecode	ogzy	sorry my friend - you have stumped me - other than to check the list of packages that you have installed, maybe ensure you have the obex-data-server package installed, I'd also expect the following to be installed:       bluetooth  bluez-gnome  bluez-utils gnome-bluetooth, but I'd expect everything to already be installed if you have it working as far as you do..
2008-08-04T19:50:00.000Z	ogzy	bytecode	all are installed
2008-08-04T19:51:00.000Z	bytecode	ogzy	sorry - I can not think of any other avenues to try.
2008-08-04T19:52:00.000Z	ogzy	bytecode	ok thanx anyway
