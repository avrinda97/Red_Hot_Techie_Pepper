2008-12-22T08:49:00.000Z	IdleOne		ok I have a very weird issue here. My keyboard stopped working for no apparent reason after upgrade was complete and rebooted
2008-12-22T08:50:00.000Z	canthus13	IdleOne	Is it a USB keyboard?
2008-12-22T08:50:00.000Z	IdleOne	canthus13	no ps/2
2008-12-22T08:50:00.000Z	canthus13	IdleOne	Dunno then.  I had the same happen with a usb keyboard... Unplugging it and plugging it back in fixed the problem.
2008-12-22T08:51:00.000Z	canthus13	IdleOne	That won't work with PS/2, though.
2008-12-22T08:51:00.000Z	IdleOne	canthus13	let me try pluggin in the usb KB
