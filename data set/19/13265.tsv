2005-04-24T15:15:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Acidflash	where did you download xpde from?
2005-04-24T15:15:00.000Z	Acidflash	Burgundavia	from xpde.com
2005-04-24T15:16:00.000Z	Acidflash	Burgundavia	i don't find any .deb version.
2005-04-24T15:17:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Acidflash	I am looking for it as well
2005-04-24T15:17:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Acidflash	is there a reason you can't reskin gnome or kde?
2005-04-24T15:19:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Acidflash	you might want to try #xpde
2005-04-24T15:20:00.000Z	Acidflash	Burgundavia	i Run kde. But my girlfriend is new in Linux, and she shud feel good to look like windows to beg.. Then she will run KDE aswell.
2005-04-24T15:20:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Acidflash	hmm, I would reskin KDE to look like windows myself
2005-04-24T15:21:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Acidflash	xpde is very much beta software and kde is far more mature
2005-04-24T15:21:00.000Z	Acidflash	Burgundavia	yes i know.
2005-04-24T15:22:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Acidflash	if there was a debian package, then I would point you there
2005-04-24T15:23:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Acidflash	but as there isn't, and given the age/maturity of the software, I am hesitant to recommend installing it
2005-04-24T15:23:00.000Z	Acidflash	Burgundavia	witch network are #xpde on? Not this..
2005-04-24T15:23:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Acidflash	they claim it is here on their site
2005-04-24T15:24:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Acidflash	xpde looks almost dead to me
2005-04-24T15:25:00.000Z	Acidflash	Burgundavia	me too.
