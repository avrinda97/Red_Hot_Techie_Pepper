2008-09-18T11:38:00.000Z	bakarat		i have a massive .rar file that needs to be unzipped, unfortunately the default archiver seems to unzip to /tmp first, which does not have enough space to hold it, any ideas how i can unzip it directly to the specified location?
2008-09-18T11:39:00.000Z	hateball	bakarat	unrar from commandline
2008-09-18T11:39:00.000Z	bakarat	hateball	would you know the proper command? :p
2008-09-18T11:39:00.000Z	hateball	bakarat	man unrar ;)
2008-09-18T11:39:00.000Z	bakarat	hateball	ah k :>
2008-09-18T11:40:00.000Z	hateball	bakarat	I much prefer commandline anyhow, because of recursive switches etc
2008-09-18T11:40:00.000Z	bakarat	hateball	well this is the first time i've run into trouble with the archiver tool :>
2008-09-18T11:41:00.000Z	hateball	bakarat	ok :)
2008-09-18T11:42:00.000Z	bakarat	hateball	btw, you are sure the commandline one doesn't write to /tmp first right? :p
2008-09-18T11:43:00.000Z	hateball	bakarat	Hmmm no... I just assumed it doesnt, since it feels faster than using a gui archiver. Try? :p
2008-09-18T11:43:00.000Z	bakarat	hateball	still looking up an example command hehe
2008-09-18T11:44:00.000Z	bakarat	hateball	not sure which parameters to use from the man only
2008-09-18T11:44:00.000Z	hateball	bakarat	unrar e -r /path/to/files/*.rar will extract recursively in the current directory
2008-09-18T11:44:00.000Z	bakarat	hateball	how do i enter the password?
2008-09-18T11:45:00.000Z	bakarat	hateball	-p<pass> it says in man
2008-09-18T11:45:00.000Z	bakarat	hateball	does the password actually have to be right against the -p? or a space in between?
2008-09-18T11:45:00.000Z	hateball	bakarat	Dont know, havent unrar'd anything passwordprotected. Try... if it fails, you did it wrong ;)
2008-09-26T00:59:00.000Z	hateball	bakarat	it's the way it's designed
2008-09-26T01:00:00.000Z	bakarat	hateball	well i'm having a bit of trouble with my bridge which bridges over the connection that network-manager is attending to
