2006-11-20T09:13:00.000Z	fumon		Of course.
2006-11-20T09:14:00.000Z	fumon		I've got full recognition of the soundcard... all the bells a whistles too... but it dosn't seem to want to output any sound at all.
2006-11-20T09:14:00.000Z	fumon		Hahah
2006-11-20T09:15:00.000Z	fumon		It is recognising my soundcard, it says "Autigy 2 ZS".
2006-11-20T09:15:00.000Z	fumon		Selected in the volume control and everything.
2006-11-20T09:15:00.000Z	fumon		Yeah, it's unmuted.
2006-11-20T09:16:00.000Z	fumon		*sigh* now I remember why I abandoned linux... 16 different distro installs... just one more that screwed up horribly.
2006-11-20T09:16:00.000Z	fumon		I'm nearly a veteran at this point.
2006-11-20T09:18:00.000Z	jvolkman-h	fumon	have you tried alsamixer?
2006-11-20T09:18:00.000Z	fumon		Gentoo 3 times, fedora, ubuntu, suse... think I tried mandrake...
2006-11-20T09:18:00.000Z	fumon	jvolkman-h	how do you mean?
2006-11-20T09:19:00.000Z	jvolkman-h	fumon	alsamixer is a terminal application to mess with audio settings
2006-11-20T09:19:00.000Z	jvolkman-h	fumon	have you tried it?
2006-11-20T09:19:00.000Z	fumon	jvolkman-h	not as of yet, though I shall now. Thankyou for reminding me about it.
2006-11-20T09:21:00.000Z	jvolkman-h	fumon	from a simple google search, it looks like there's a common issue with your card and the digital output being enabled -- turning it off should fix your problem
2006-11-20T09:22:00.000Z	fumon	jvolkman-h	I have done that...
2006-11-20T09:22:00.000Z	fumon	jvolkman-h	it was the first thing I noticed.
2006-11-20T09:22:00.000Z	jvolkman-h		still no sound?
2006-11-20T09:23:00.000Z	fumon	jvolkman-h	wait! Miraculosly, toggleing it about 8 times in a row in frustration produced a different result...
