2008-01-30T01:52:00.000Z	Masque7		hey, does anyone know how to get a briged connection in vmware with ubuntu as the guest?
2008-01-30T01:53:00.000Z	Cpudan80	Masque7	Ubuntu as the guest?
2008-01-30T01:53:00.000Z	Cpudan80	Masque7	The bridge is hooked up on the client side
2008-01-30T01:53:00.000Z	Cpudan80		Err sorry, server side
2008-01-30T01:53:00.000Z	Masque7		yes, i'm getting "VMnet0 is not running"
2008-01-30T01:53:00.000Z	Cpudan80		What is the host OS?
2008-01-30T01:54:00.000Z	Masque7		host os is xp home
2008-01-30T01:54:00.000Z	Masque7		somebody told me you need xp pro
2008-01-30T01:54:00.000Z	Cpudan80	Masque7	Might be true, ask ##windows
2008-01-30T01:54:00.000Z	Cpudan80	Masque7	The bridge is probably bridged to the wrong connection or something
2008-01-30T01:55:00.000Z	Cpudan80	Masque7	Ubuntu runs fine in a VM (usually) --- why are you bridging the connection to begin with?
2008-01-30T01:55:00.000Z	Masque7	Cpudan80	no idea really, tried googling and there was talk of editting .inf fils and etc
2008-01-30T01:55:00.000Z	Cpudan80	Masque7	Yeah... dunno, that's a windows thing
2008-01-30T01:55:00.000Z	Masque7	Cpudan80	NAT works fine... I can't see Windows Network with NAT though (right?)
2008-01-30T01:55:00.000Z	Masque7	Cpudan80	I also wanted to do the samba thing
2008-01-30T01:56:00.000Z	Cpudan80	Masque7	You should really ask ##windows
2008-01-30T01:56:00.000Z	Cpudan80		I'm over there too :-)
2008-01-30T01:56:00.000Z	Masque7	Cpudan80	i know, off there now
2008-01-30T01:56:00.000Z	Cpudan80	Masque7	some of them have extensive vmware experience
