2010-09-19T21:40:00.000Z	collabra	Scottie1	have you tried installing on different machine,.... maybe it's your harddrive
2010-09-19T21:41:00.000Z	Scottie1	collabra	I don't have another machine that I can lose data from, so no
2010-09-19T21:46:00.000Z	collabra	Scottie1	is this a CD or a USB Drive?
2010-09-19T21:47:00.000Z	Scottie1	collabra	I've tried both.
2010-09-19T21:48:00.000Z	collabra	Scottie1	I think it's time to buy a hard drive.
2010-09-19T21:48:00.000Z	Scottie1	collabra	I'm not buying a new hard drive.
2010-09-19T21:50:00.000Z	collabra	Scottie1	yup,... at ANY time,.... I had to replace a two week old hard drive once.
2010-09-19T21:50:00.000Z	Scottie1	collabra	that still doesn't help me. I'm not buying a new drive.
2010-09-19T21:50:00.000Z	collabra	Scottie1	then partition your drive only to 30 percent
2010-09-19T21:51:00.000Z	Scottie1	collabra	I don't understand partitioning or why I need to do it.
2010-09-19T21:51:00.000Z	collabra	Scottie1	obviously you have some bad sectors,.. I might recomend spinrite
2010-09-19T21:52:00.000Z	collabra	Scottie1	not much you can do about bad sectors on a harddrive
2010-09-19T21:53:00.000Z	Scottie1	collabra	Dude, okay, I appreciate the effort, but you aren't helping me.
2010-09-19T21:53:00.000Z	collabra	Scottie1	i apologize.... it's wasn't my intent...
2010-09-19T21:54:00.000Z	Scottie1	collabra	I appreciate it, I do, but you aren't explaining anything you say so it's just frustrating me
2010-09-19T21:55:00.000Z	collabra	Scottie1	bad sectors would frustrate me also.... but there are workarounds,... like what Dr_Willis is suggesting
2010-09-19T21:57:00.000Z	collabra	Scottie1	how big is your harddrive currently?
2010-09-19T21:57:00.000Z	Scottie1	collabra	250g
2010-09-19T22:16:00.000Z	collabra	Scottie1	I'm betting on success...
