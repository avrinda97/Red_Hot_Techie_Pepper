2010-12-17T16:53:00.000Z	SandytriesUbuntu		Hey
2010-12-17T16:53:00.000Z	SandytriesUbuntu		I tried Ubuntu live DVD on my laptop and it cannot see any wifi networks
2010-12-17T16:54:00.000Z	SandytriesUbuntu		Can any one please shed some light?
2010-12-17T16:54:00.000Z	SandytriesUbuntu		ya...flash sucks
2010-12-17T16:55:00.000Z	soreau	SandytriesUbuntu	Which wifi chip?
2010-12-17T16:55:00.000Z	SandytriesUbuntu	soreau	Good question....checking
2010-12-17T16:56:00.000Z	SandytriesUbuntu	soreau	I guess its Atheros Communications Inc.
2010-12-17T16:56:00.000Z	soreau	SandytriesUbuntu	Should work OOTB then unless its a really new chipset
2010-12-17T16:57:00.000Z	SandytriesUbuntu		ahh...
2010-12-17T16:57:00.000Z	SandytriesUbuntu		@se7en ndis wrapper?  hmmm...not sure if that is installed
2010-12-17T16:57:00.000Z	soreau	SandytriesUbuntu	You should not need ndiswrapper.
2010-12-17T16:57:00.000Z	soreau	SandytriesUbuntu	Are you able to show the output of lsmod|grep ath from that machine?
2010-12-17T16:58:00.000Z	SandytriesUbuntu		@ectospam  ha..I like that....reboot is the mother of all solutions
2010-12-17T16:58:00.000Z	SandytriesUbuntu		oh snap...cant do that as I had booted from a live Ubuntu DVD
2010-12-17T16:59:00.000Z	SandytriesUbuntu		guys I might give Suse Linux a try...it's supposed to be laptop friendly
2010-12-17T17:00:00.000Z	soreau	SandytriesUbuntu	First make sure the driver is loaded with lsmod|grep ath (it should show some output including ath9k or ath5k depending on your chip) if not, check dmesg output for errors. If its loaded, check iwconfig for a wlan0 interface. If you have one, then scan with iwlist wlan0 scan
2010-12-17T17:00:00.000Z	SandytriesUbuntu	soreau	Thanks a bunch...I'll be back
2010-12-17T17:00:00.000Z	SandytriesUbuntu		Thanks everyone for your inputs
2010-12-17T17:00:00.000Z	soreau	SandytriesUbuntu	But in most cases, you should be able to just click on the little wifi icon and see the networks
