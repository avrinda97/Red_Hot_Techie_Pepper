2012-09-21T00:29:00.000Z	crundar_		how do you set limit which users can delete files. That doesn't fit under the rwx rubric I'm thinking of. Do I have to use ACLs to manage that?
2012-09-21T00:29:00.000Z	crundar_		either?
2012-09-21T00:30:00.000Z	crundar_		is delete normally treated as write as well?
2012-09-21T00:30:00.000Z	Cyberspaceloa	crundar_	you'd want to utilize groups, I'd think
2012-09-21T00:30:00.000Z	Cyberspaceloa		and only add the users you want to give permissions to into the appropriate group
2012-09-21T00:31:00.000Z	crundar_		well, I want my whole group to be able to create, but no user able to delete anyone else's stuff. This is a shared directory
2012-09-21T00:32:00.000Z	crundar_		I'm trying to set up a shared media drive for the house
2012-09-21T00:32:00.000Z	Cyberspaceloa		well, I'm no professional admin or anything, crundar_
2012-09-21T00:32:00.000Z	Cyberspaceloa		but to my thinking you can make the parent folder accessible globally
2012-09-21T00:32:00.000Z	crundar_		me neither.
2012-09-21T00:32:00.000Z	Cyberspaceloa		and then give each user their own folder with the proper permissions
2012-09-21T00:34:00.000Z	Cyberspaceloa		I think you'd need to find a wine/pol specific group, takyon29
2012-09-21T00:35:00.000Z	Cyberspaceloa	crundar_	did your question get answered?
2012-09-21T00:35:00.000Z	crundar_	Cyberspaceloa	Well I'm investigating umask. I didn't know that it affected a particular directory. I just thought it affected the given proccess it was set for
2012-09-21T00:36:00.000Z	crundar_	Cyberspaceloa	so I didn't think, unless i set the default umask for the other users, that it would work. but maybe. tl;dr. no, not yet.
2012-09-21T00:37:00.000Z	Cyberspaceloa	crundar_	can you describe exactly what you're trying to do? A shared folder, correct?
2012-09-21T00:37:00.000Z	crundar_	Cyberspaceloa	yeah. like a shared media drive. I want everyone in the group to be able to drop off movies and stuff, but not delete anyone elses
2012-09-21T00:37:00.000Z	crundar_		I've got the room
2012-09-21T00:38:00.000Z	Cyberspaceloa	crundar_	what I would do is give each user a single folder in which they could write
