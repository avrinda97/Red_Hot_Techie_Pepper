2011-05-07T10:51:00.000Z	Zelozelos	bluegoon	 thers a shared folder you should use
2011-05-07T10:51:00.000Z	bluegoon	Zelozelos	cool, OK makes sense to do that.
2011-05-07T10:51:00.000Z	Zelozelos	bluegoon	or you an also set up groups and sharing that way i think
2011-05-07T10:53:00.000Z	bluegoon	Zelozelos	says this feature cannot be enabled because you need the required app, its personal file sharing
2011-05-07T10:54:00.000Z	Zelozelos	bluegoon	the groups feature? i wasnt sure if it worked r not, i think thats actually for networking
2011-05-07T10:55:00.000Z	bluegoon	Zelozelos	lemme try and obtain it, you would think they would include it by default
2011-05-07T11:07:00.000Z	Zelozelos	bluegoon	what i did was moved anything i wanted 2 share into windows public folder (vista)
2011-05-07T11:07:00.000Z	bluegoon	Zelozelos	oh ok
2011-05-07T11:11:00.000Z	Zelozelos	bluegoon	apps, accessories, passwords and encryption keys then  on the passwords tab double click on network secret for (your network ssid )
2011-05-07T11:12:00.000Z	bluegoon	Zelozelos	I dont have passwords and encryption keys listed, damn
2011-05-07T11:13:00.000Z	Zelozelos	bluegoon	you may have 2 edit the menu and check the box for it
