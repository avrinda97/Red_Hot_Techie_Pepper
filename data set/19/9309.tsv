2008-04-21T12:19:00.000Z	Rainarrow		Hello guys, what's the best way of sharing files between 2 Ubuntu machines in a LAN?
2008-04-21T12:19:00.000Z	Rainarrow		Because I heard samba is best for sharing between Windows and Linux boxes
2008-04-21T12:19:00.000Z	Rainarrow		so if I have two Ubuntu boxes do I have a better choice?
2008-04-21T12:20:00.000Z	Rainarrow		!share

2008-04-21T12:22:00.000Z	jburd	Rainarrow	scp, sftp
2008-04-21T12:23:00.000Z	Rainarrow	jburd	thanks, would you mind explain a little more? of course I could just google around if otherwise
2008-04-21T12:24:00.000Z	Rainarrow	jburd	I've not heard anything about scp
2008-04-21T12:24:00.000Z	jburd	Rainarrow	SSH is used for secure access to resources.  scp is a tool to copy files over SSH.
2008-04-21T12:24:00.000Z	Rainarrow	jburd	ok, so I need to setup a SSH server on one of my Linux boxes right
2008-04-21T12:24:00.000Z	jburd	Rainarrow	You will need SSH server instances on both computers if you wish to access either of them from any one.
2008-04-21T12:25:00.000Z	Rainarrow	jburd	ok thanks, I'll google for a howto on SSH
2008-04-21T12:25:00.000Z	jburd	Rainarrow	You can then access both computers using Nautilus or the command line.
2008-04-21T12:26:00.000Z	jburd	Rainarrow	Try this first:  Places > Connect to Server... > Service Type: SSH
2008-04-21T12:26:00.000Z	jburd	Rainarrow	It will create a network mount on your Desktop.  Just click and you'll be able to copy files pretty easily.
2008-04-21T12:27:00.000Z	Rainarrow	jburd	I'm trying, waiting for apt-get to finish
2008-04-21T12:29:00.000Z	Rainarrow	jburd	thanks, it works very well
2008-04-21T12:29:00.000Z	Rainarrow	jburd	and it's just what I want
2008-04-21T12:29:00.000Z	jburd	Rainarrow	np
