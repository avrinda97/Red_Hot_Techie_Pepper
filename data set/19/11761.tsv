2005-11-24T09:22:00.000Z	fanopnaic	keeb	I'd say decide on a player (I suggest vlc and xine and gmplayer), and then read about the RestrictedFormats :)
2005-11-24T09:55:00.000Z	fanopnaic	keeb	why compiling?
2005-11-24T10:03:00.000Z	keeb	fanopnaic	can you check your pm please?
2005-11-24T10:04:00.000Z	fanopnaic	keeb	I have none.
2005-11-24T10:06:00.000Z	fanopnaic	keeb	yes
2005-11-24T10:10:00.000Z	keeb	fanopnaic	i installed vlc.. how do i run it? :\
2005-11-24T10:11:00.000Z	fanopnaic	keeb	by typing "vlc"
2005-11-24T10:11:00.000Z	fanopnaic	keeb	And it's also in Applications -> Sound & Video
2005-11-24T10:18:00.000Z	fanopnaic	keeb	you need to sudo, and you might want to try fdisk -l
