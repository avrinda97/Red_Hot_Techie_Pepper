2009-12-22T02:38:00.000Z	Pholious		hey guys... I have previously set up a dual boot into /boot/grub/grub.conf, but now I want to edit it and the file seems to be completely gone... it's not in /etc/ either... any ideas? (the dual boot does work properly, so it has to be somewhere...)
2009-12-22T02:39:00.000Z	holmser	Pholious	you using 9.10?
