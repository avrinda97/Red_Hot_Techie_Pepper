2008-08-02T11:07:00.000Z	glitsj16	cypherdelic	there might be something under ~/.config/autostart or /etc/xdg/autostart that you could manually try to remove
2008-08-02T11:10:00.000Z	cypherdelic	glitsj16	do you know what gdl_box.autostart is?
2008-08-02T11:11:00.000Z	glitsj16	cypherdelic	no i don't .. but looking inside that file might show some light on things
2008-08-02T11:14:00.000Z	glitsj16	cypherdelic	have you opened that autostart file with an editor ? should be regular .desktop syntax in there, with a program name and exec line inside
2008-08-02T11:15:00.000Z	cypherdelic	glitsj16	i checked both folders there is just Cairo-dock and that is right, but this session-dialog of cairo-dock is the problem, but i definately guess that gnome autosave session occured this problem
2008-08-02T11:17:00.000Z	cypherdelic	glitsj16	that gdl_box was google desktop i also removed that
2008-08-02T11:18:00.000Z	glitsj16	cypherdelic	okay, one less thing heh
2008-08-02T11:19:00.000Z	cypherdelic	glitsj16	i will try if that fixed that cairo-sttings-dialog-problem too
2008-08-02T11:21:00.000Z	cypherdelic	glitsj16	oh well it did, **** google desktop, ill teach my console four words sudo aptitude remove google-desktop
2008-08-02T11:21:00.000Z	glitsj16	cypherdelic	:)
2008-08-02T11:22:00.000Z	cypherdelic	glitsj16	very well all my current issues are gone, now i can focus on bugging MSI-ticket-system with request on producing 64bit drivers for a new tv-stick :D
2008-08-02T11:22:00.000Z	glitsj16	cypherdelic	goodluck with that :p
2008-08-02T11:25:00.000Z	cypherdelic	glitsj16	seems like that will not work, but its kinda fun to because i work at a call entry for it-support for a huge corporation
2008-08-02T11:26:00.000Z	glitsj16	cypherdelic	can't win 'em all i guess, having an issue-free ubuntu makes good though
2008-08-02T11:26:00.000Z	cypherdelic	glitsj16	dont the users have to ask the manufactures for more linux support?
2008-08-02T11:27:00.000Z	glitsj16	cypherdelic	sure, no argument there, all for that .. it has greatly improved ( a few exceptions aside)
2008-08-02T11:27:00.000Z	cypherdelic	glitsj16	what msi needs to do is take there pc on that they precompiled the driver for kernel 2.6.22 and above
2008-08-02T11:28:00.000Z	cypherdelic	glitsj16	make it 64bit hardware install that 64bit kernel and recompile that driver with --force-architecture
2008-08-02T11:28:00.000Z	cypherdelic	glitsj16	is that so hard
