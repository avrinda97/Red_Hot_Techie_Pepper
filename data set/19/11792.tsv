2006-01-03T11:00:00.000Z	mcjerry	Remmy	what kernel ver do you have? there were some issues with not recognizing sata2 a while back
2006-01-03T11:00:00.000Z	Remmy	mcjerry	This waswith 2.6.12-9 for amd-k8-smp
2006-01-03T11:02:00.000Z	mcjerry	Remmy	2.6.12-9 caused problems with me here with amd64 not dual core.....both 64 and 32 mode problems seeing sata correctly.....fixed in 2.6.15
2006-01-03T11:03:00.000Z	Remmy	mcjerry	I don't see that one in my list with packages?
2006-01-03T11:03:00.000Z	mcjerry	Remmy	you breezy still?
2006-01-03T11:03:00.000Z	Remmy	mcjerry	If that's 5.10,yes
2006-01-03T11:03:00.000Z	mcjerry	Remmy	you got a dual boot windows setup?
2006-01-03T11:04:00.000Z	Remmy	mcjerry	Newp, not on this machine
2006-01-03T11:06:00.000Z	mcjerry	Remmy	If you want, I'd personally make a backup image of your current install and try changing sources to 6.04 dapper and apt-get update then apt-get dist-upgrade and get current kernel.....
2006-01-03T11:06:00.000Z	mcjerry	Remmy	then if doesn't fix sata2 prob you could fall back on backup image
2006-01-03T11:06:00.000Z	Remmy	mcjerry	I'll try that then I think... thanks :)
2006-01-03T11:08:00.000Z	mcjerry	Remmy	I also remember seeing some posts i think was on bugzilla.ubuntu.com about sata issues
2006-01-03T11:09:00.000Z	Remmy	mcjerry	Prolly the last time I buy me modern stuff, hehe... couldn't get Mandriva to install at all
2006-01-03T11:10:00.000Z	mcjerry	Remmy	don't think is smp prob...but could be wrong.....what happened here was I have 2 sata drives and went from 2.6.12-7 to 2.6.12-9 and 2nd sata would not detect in ubuntu but when i went to 2.6.12-10 it worked fine
2006-01-03T11:11:00.000Z	mcjerry	Remmy	so you could look for more current 2.6.12-x in curent packages to see before changing too dapper...
2006-01-03T11:11:00.000Z	Remmy	mcjerry	In my case it would not even boot, said it could not open /dev/sda1 for writing (!?)
2006-01-03T11:11:00.000Z	Remmy	mcjerry	I just dl'ed 2.6.15
2006-01-03T11:12:00.000Z	mcjerry	Remmy	what fs is root part?
2006-01-03T11:12:00.000Z	Remmy	mcjerry	The sda one, 0,0,0
