2012-06-22T17:32:00.000Z	Ashael		ubuntu software center is stuck in the middle of an installation. trying to cancel it doesn't work. what can i do? is there a way to close it so i can try to remove the packages and reinstall?
2012-06-22T17:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ashael	you can ill the app then run the aptfix commands
2012-10-30T20:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ashael	did you install :   p7zip       p7zip-full  p7zip-rar
2012-10-30T20:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ashael	That's why then......
2012-10-30T20:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ashael	I also suggest you install unp rar and unrar
2012-10-30T20:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ashael	you need those packages for file roller to be able to extract 7zip archives
2012-10-30T20:38:00.000Z	Ashael	ActionParsnip	installed all those packages, File-roller simply crashes whenever i try to open it or extract a file in a dir... i get a blank window with the title, which then crashes after a few seconds.
2012-10-30T20:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ashael	you won't. Just use file roller and it will extract it
2012-10-30T20:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ashael	there isn't a specific GUI app for 7zip
2012-10-30T20:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ashael	try using unp :)
2012-10-30T20:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ashael	use the command: unp    to extract the file
2012-10-30T20:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ashael	unp filename
2012-10-30T20:42:00.000Z	Ashael	ActionParsnip	i get this: "WARNING: There were errors while processing files!" and nothing else.
2012-10-30T20:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ashael	is the archive healthy? Is there an MD5sum or SHA5sum
2012-10-30T20:47:00.000Z	Ashael	ActionParsnip	i tried it on several different archives - zip, 7z, tar.gz. same with all.
2012-10-30T20:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ashael	what is the output  of:  lsb_release -sc
2012-10-30T20:48:00.000Z	Ashael	ActionParsnip	quantal
