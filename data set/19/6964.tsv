2007-11-02T06:32:00.000Z	strangeintp		can someone help me with my bin problem?
2007-11-02T06:32:00.000Z	pipegeek	strangeintp	did you set your .bin executable?
2007-11-02T06:33:00.000Z	strangeintp	pipegeek	 hm I'm kind of a linux newb - how do I do that?
2007-11-02T06:33:00.000Z	pipegeek	strangeintp	np ^.^  just do "chmod +x whosywhatsits.bin"
2007-11-02T06:34:00.000Z	pipegeek	strangeintp	in windows, you mark something executable by giving it the right filename extension---in unix, it's a permissions thing
2007-11-02T06:34:00.000Z	pipegeek	strangeintp	the reason is that, that way, you have to explicitly allow anything you download to be run---no such thing as a trojan.jpg.scr
2007-11-02T06:34:00.000Z	strangeintp	pipegeek	 gotcha...  I tried messing with permissions once before and broke my head, or something
2007-11-02T06:35:00.000Z	pipegeek	strangeintp	and you can do it from gnome, by right-clicking, going to properties, and going to "Permissions"
2007-11-02T06:39:00.000Z	strangeintp	pipegeek	 I'm surprised I can set the executable permission w/o being su...
2007-11-02T06:39:00.000Z	pipegeek	strangeintp	you can change any permissions you have the right to change (ie, on any files you have ownership of)
2007-11-02T06:40:00.000Z	pipegeek	strangeintp	however, you can only *run* it as you.  Meaning, if it is malicious, all it can destroy is your home directory
2007-11-02T06:40:00.000Z	pipegeek	strangeintp	you're allowed to do anything you want to your own data --- you just can't futz with *other* people's data.  Only root can do that
2007-11-02T06:42:00.000Z	strangeintp	pipegeek	 gah... still telling me command not found
2007-11-02T06:45:00.000Z	pipegeek	strangeintp	you still there?  I just sent you a PM
2007-11-02T06:49:00.000Z	strangeintp	pipegeek	 you can install vmware through synaptic?
2007-11-02T06:49:00.000Z	pipegeek	strangeintp	canonical has packaged the server.  You need to add http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu
2007-11-02T06:51:00.000Z	pipegeek	strangeintp	did you ever get that binary installed?
2007-11-02T06:53:00.000Z	strangeintp	pipegeek	yep
