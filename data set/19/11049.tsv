2007-11-03T06:48:00.000Z	swmiller6	CaptainMorgan	in configuration editor you go to apps>nautilus>desktop
2007-11-03T06:49:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	swmiller6	that's interesting.. a whole devoted to this... is this new or was it there in past distros ?
2007-11-03T06:49:00.000Z	swmiller6	CaptainMorgan	been there all along
2007-11-03T06:51:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	swmiller6	a whole new world, sheesh
2007-11-03T06:52:00.000Z	swmiller6	CaptainMorgan	 careful what you change
2007-11-03T07:03:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	swmiller6	is it possible prevent workspace overlap ?
2007-11-03T07:03:00.000Z	swmiller6	CaptainMorgan	maximize it
2007-11-03T07:04:00.000Z	swmiller6	CaptainMorgan	are you using compiz
2007-11-03T07:04:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	swmiller6	yea... but that's an extra task, maybe a way to make it default - not to overlap ?
2007-11-03T07:04:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	swmiller6	I assume I am - I have such pretty graphcis
2007-11-03T07:04:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	swmiller6	I just upgraded to Gutsy
2007-11-03T07:05:00.000Z	swmiller6	CaptainMorgan	in the compizconfig manager you could set the windows to snap
2007-11-03T07:05:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	swmiller6	sounds like it might work.. thanks
