2007-10-22T07:25:00.000Z	cdm10	kousotu	what do you want to do with it?
2007-10-22T07:25:00.000Z	kousotu	cdm10	use it as a "kitchen timer"
2007-10-22T07:26:00.000Z	cdm10	kousotu	just run the command < sleep <SECONDS> && cat /dev/random > /dev/dsp >
2007-10-22T07:26:00.000Z	cdm10	kousotu	it's not great, but it works, and I don't know of anything else.
2007-10-22T07:26:00.000Z	kousotu	cdm10	I don't want to shut dow/sleep my Laptp to do so eithewr
2007-10-22T07:26:00.000Z	cdm10	kousotu	it won't sleep your laptop.
2007-10-22T07:27:00.000Z	cdm10	kousotu	the sleep command just tells it to wait... I'm sure there's something else out there that's better, and doesn't require command line use, lemme look around for a sec...
2007-10-22T07:28:00.000Z	cdm10	kousotu	yeah, why don't you? I'd do it in Python :)
2007-10-22T07:28:00.000Z	kousotu	cdm10	bacause I can't ode?
2007-10-22T07:28:00.000Z	cdm10	kousotu	just kidding :)
2007-10-22T07:28:00.000Z	kousotu	cdm10	isn't python wht they usually code viruses in?
2007-10-22T07:29:00.000Z	cdm10	kousotu	what gave you that idea? I'd think that viruses are coded in C, if anything.
2007-10-22T07:29:00.000Z	kousotu	cdm10	I heard it somewhere
2007-10-22T07:30:00.000Z	cdm10	kousotu	hmm, there's KTimer, but that's for KDE, so it'll be a big install on a Gnome system.
2007-10-22T07:30:00.000Z	kousotu	cdm10	I have kdeinstaledalready
2007-10-22T07:30:00.000Z	kousotu	cdm10	took 4 hours :(
2007-10-22T07:30:00.000Z	cdm10	kousotu	ah, then it shouldn't be too bad, just install ktimer
