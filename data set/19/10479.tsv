2007-10-20T09:20:00.000Z	martyvis	joanki	just ask your q!
2007-10-20T09:22:00.000Z	martyvis	joanki	you can probably get away with no swap with 1GB ram
2007-10-20T09:22:00.000Z	martyvis	joanki	however is your want to hibernate you will want 1GB plus a little bit
2007-10-20T09:23:00.000Z	martyvis	joanki	1500
2007-10-20T09:23:00.000Z	martyvis	joanki	the tutorial is wrong
2007-10-20T09:24:00.000Z	martyvis	joanki	this applied when people had ram of 8MB (like my first linux machine in 1993)
2007-10-20T09:29:00.000Z	martyvis	joanki	sounds ok - just don't rip too many DVDs
2007-10-20T09:30:00.000Z	martyvis	joanki	~1200
2007-10-20T09:30:00.000Z	martyvis	joanki	whoops ~12000
