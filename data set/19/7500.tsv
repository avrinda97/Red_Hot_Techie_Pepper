2009-06-16T21:15:00.000Z	giiker		I have acces to a remote shell. I want to configure a sshd config file. Will I be able to create one in my user directory and use my own?
2009-06-16T21:15:00.000Z	erUSUL	giiker	no
2009-06-16T21:16:00.000Z	giiker	erUSUL	no? is there any way to configure the version of SSH?
2009-06-16T21:17:00.000Z	erUSUL	giiker	yes there is but that settings are in control of the administrator of the server as it should be
2009-06-16T21:18:00.000Z	giiker	erUSUL	no? is there any way to check the version of the SSH server
2009-06-16T21:18:00.000Z	erUSUL	giiker	with verasion you are refering to the protocol version or the version of the sshd server itself ?
2009-06-16T21:20:00.000Z	giiker	erUSUL	the version of the protocol
2009-06-16T21:22:00.000Z	erUSUL	giiker	i suppose the client can tell what version it has negotiated with the server it connects to... or just force ssh to use protocolo 1 or 2 if it fails you know what are supported and what not
2009-06-16T21:23:00.000Z	giiker	erUSUL	ok I guess I will try that, thanks!
2009-06-16T21:23:00.000Z	erUSUL	giiker	or pass it -vvv
2009-06-16T21:24:00.000Z	erUSUL	giiker	when passing -vvv you will se something like debug1: Remote protocol version 2.0, remote software version OpenSSH_5.1p1 Debian-5ubuntu1
2009-06-16T21:25:00.000Z	giiker	erUSUL	I found the config file for the client and one can also set the preffered protocol and forgot what you just said about verbose...
2009-06-16T21:28:00.000Z	giiker	erUSUL	verbose threw out hte info I was looking for thanks again!
2009-06-16T21:28:00.000Z	erUSUL	giiker	no problem
2011-03-05T22:59:00.000Z	erUSUL	giiker	print to doc has allways been only ps afaik ...
2011-03-05T23:00:00.000Z	erUSUL	giiker	nope you are right gnome print dialog has pdf ps and svg
2011-03-05T23:02:00.000Z	giiker	erUSUL	yeahp I even have that option in gedit, but can't figure out what is going n, this is the second time happens. The first one happened when I upadted ubuntu  9.04, aahhhggrr!
2011-03-05T23:03:00.000Z	erUSUL	giiker	openofficve has its own pdf export funcionality. not related to gnome print subsystem
2011-03-05T23:05:00.000Z	giiker	erUSUL	yeah I know, I need gnome print 'cause it is different for my printing needs thatn exporting and faster...
