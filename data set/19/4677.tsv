2010-03-12T18:24:00.000Z	jeeves_Moss		I have an Acer D150, and I can't figure out for the life of me how to track down a serious bug.  I can be using my system, and the screen goes totally blank.  I've tested it in windows (no issues there), and when the screen blanks, the WiFi card appiers to still be transmitting, however, I can't shell into it.  anyone with ideas how to track this down?
2010-03-12T18:25:00.000Z	dj_segfault	jeeves_Moss	Sounds like the kernel is fine and X is dying or comatose.  Can you kill X and see what happens?
2010-03-12T18:26:00.000Z	jeeves_Moss	dj_segfault	as I said, I don't have a screen.  I have to hard reboot it.  I've tried the key combo to get to shell (ie. ctrl+alt+f<key>, then logging in, and nothing)
2010-03-12T18:27:00.000Z	dj_segfault	jeeves_Moss	Do you have another machine you can ssh in from?  Sorry I misread your original post
2010-03-12T18:28:00.000Z	jeeves_Moss	dj_segfault	I tried, and it refuses the connection (both WiFi and wired).  and since we're on a netbook, I don't have serial to connect in with (and I don't know where my USB to serial adaptor is)
2010-03-12T18:30:00.000Z	dj_segfault	jeeves_Moss	This is a bit of a long shot, but can you WIn-Space to launch gnome-do and then run some app that would cause some visible action, like ping or eject?  Or just shut down?
2010-03-12T18:30:00.000Z	jeeves_Moss	dj_segfault	win-space?  you mean the key combo?
2010-03-12T18:31:00.000Z	dj_segfault	jeeves_Moss	Yes.
2010-03-12T18:31:00.000Z	jeeves_Moss	dj_segfault	I'll try that next time.  Is there anything in the logs that you can think of, or could I write a "trap" script that'll launch when I do a macro to scrape some logs @ that point
2010-03-12T18:33:00.000Z	dj_segfault	jeeves_Moss	Unless you frag your hard drive from shutting down, all you have to do is reboot and loot at the right time in the logfiles.  No need to do anything fancy.
2010-03-12T18:33:00.000Z	jeeves_Moss	dj_segfault	that's what I did last time, and there was no serious issues I could find in the logs.  it's like X just took a vacation (or ODed on something good!  LOL)
2010-03-12T18:35:00.000Z	dj_segfault	jeeves_Moss	I often find that when that happens; nothing in the logs.  What I've done in the past is write a cron job that does a ps -aux every few minutes to a timestamped file and deletes those files over an hour old.
2010-03-12T18:36:00.000Z	jeeves_Moss	dj_segfault	hummmm
2010-03-12T18:36:00.000Z	jeeves_Moss	dj_segfault	is there a command that checks all of your system configs, etc for errors?  kinda like apache does?
2010-03-12T18:37:00.000Z	dj_segfault	jeeves_Moss	Not one central thing.  It would have to keep up on the development of hundreds of third party projects.  However, what I have on my system is another cron task checkhealth.sh that I constantly add things to, like file permissions that sometimes go wrong, etc.
2010-03-12T18:41:00.000Z	jeeves_Moss	dj_segfault	ahhhhh, that's cool.
2010-03-12T18:41:00.000Z	jeeves_Moss	dj_segfault	all I know is that it's not cool that windows 7 is more stable!  LOL
2010-03-12T18:42:00.000Z	dj_segfault	jeeves_Moss	I'm all for a better Windows.  Fewer pwned boxes sending out spam
2010-03-12T18:43:00.000Z	jeeves_Moss	dj_segfault	this is true.  I love Ubuntu as a sys admin for fixing p0wned windows networks.  I have no issues with hooking up my netbook to a totally infected network to fix things
