2007-10-16T10:32:00.000Z	Innomen		so, the straight answer is, no ubuntu has nothing that allows a user to disable devices graphically, because wanting that makes me a baby. (fisher price) True or false.

2007-10-16T10:35:00.000Z	IdleOne	Innomen	please stay on topic ( support )
2007-10-16T10:32:00.000Z	IdleOne	Innomen	no all it means is that nobody has made a GUI for it. perhaps you could :)
2007-10-16T10:35:00.000Z	Innomen	IdleOne	ok, how can i graphically disable a given device?
2007-10-16T10:36:00.000Z	IdleOne	Innomen	I do not know. and it does not seem there is a way to. you can make a wishlist bug on launchpad.net if thee isnt or perhaps make a GUI for what you need
2007-10-16T10:36:00.000Z	Innomen	IdleOne	thank you for a straight answer, the first one i've gotten today.
2007-10-16T10:37:00.000Z	IdleOne	Innomen	you need to remember that people here are volunteers and not everybody has every answer. there might just be a GUI for disabling a device but I dont know of one. please relax and try searching or like I said make a wish on launchpad
2007-10-16T10:38:00.000Z	Innomen	IdleOne	i was attempting to expose a fundamental problem, and then i was attacked personally for daring to insinuate that ubuntu is less than perfect.
2007-10-16T10:39:00.000Z	IdleOne	Innomen	I understand but like I said these people are volunteers and not trained or payed to help you in the manner you expect :) although the Ubuntu community is the greatest I have seen yet
2007-10-16T10:39:00.000Z	Innomen	IdleOne	i agree 100%
2007-10-16T10:40:00.000Z	IdleOne	Innomen	not lets get back on topic before the ops kick us both :)
2007-10-16T10:41:00.000Z	IdleOne	Innomen	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DeviceManagerSpec check out the link maybe you can help out
2007-10-16T10:42:00.000Z	IdleOne	Innomen	if you feel the need to explain yourself then there is #ubuntu-offtopic or #ubuntu-dev to speak to the devs about your issue here we concentrate on support as best we can
2007-10-16T10:42:00.000Z	Innomen	IdleOne	noted, thank you, i will
2007-10-16T10:45:00.000Z	IdleOne	Innomen	you are very close to the line I suggest you take this to #ubuntu-ops and speak there about how you feel you have been threated
2009-08-28T02:54:00.000Z	IdleOne	Innomen	#ubuntu+1
2009-08-28T02:55:00.000Z	Innomen	IdleOne	trhey are kinda under staffed and not helpful, thought they are trying
