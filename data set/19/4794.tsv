2009-11-06T15:00:00.000Z	VanessaE		Ok, I have to say it:   Karmic should not have been released.
2009-11-06T15:02:00.000Z	VanessaE		yup
2009-11-06T15:02:00.000Z	VanessaE		sound issues
2009-11-06T15:03:00.000Z	MaT-dg1	VanessaE	is it about the cracks you hear through the speakers?
2009-11-06T15:03:00.000Z	VanessaE		stutters under even brief CPU spikes, sometimes sound freezes entirely while the CPU hog in question is running
2009-11-06T15:03:00.000Z	VanessaE		The machine in question worked fine under Jaunty.
2009-11-06T15:04:00.000Z	VanessaE		yes, it was clean install.
2009-11-06T15:04:00.000Z	VanessaE		er, --a clean install.
2009-11-06T15:05:00.000Z	MaT-dg1		#firefox
2009-11-06T15:07:00.000Z	VanessaE	MaT-dg1	no, it's occasional "pops" in the sound, while playing music.
2009-11-06T15:07:00.000Z	VanessaE		My best guess after much googling is that it's a kernel bug in the CPU frequency scaler routines.
2009-11-06T15:07:00.000Z	VanessaE		So now I'm backing the kernel down to 2.6.28-5, something I know for sure worked under Jaunty
2009-11-06T15:08:00.000Z	VanessaE		Don't quote that stuff to me, please
2009-11-06T15:08:00.000Z	VanessaE		I've been all over the forums and the web in general
2009-11-06T15:08:00.000Z	VanessaE		I appreciate it, honestly
2009-11-06T15:09:00.000Z	VanessaE		My fault: I should have mentioned, I'm a seasoned Linux user with some 10 years' experience.
2009-11-06T15:09:00.000Z	VanessaE		yet this is just outside of my limited skills.
2009-11-06T15:09:00.000Z	MaT-dg1	VanessaE	but only when you play music? No 'pop' when an application starts to make a sound?
2009-11-06T15:10:00.000Z	VanessaE	MaT-dg1	that is correct - it's like someone's sitting there tapping the "skip forward" button on the music every once in a while
