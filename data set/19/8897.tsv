2008-04-02T19:01:00.000Z	gNewPower		hi everybody. I just set up a computer with the latest version of Ubuntu and all my fonts lack "crispness" (for lack of a better word). they look kind of blurred. any idea of what might be causing this?
2008-04-02T19:02:00.000Z	erUSUL	gNewPower	System>Preferences>Appearance Fonts Tab tweak the rendering settings maybe that helps
2008-04-02T19:04:00.000Z	gNewPower	erUSUL	I will try that, thanks
2010-07-01T21:37:00.000Z	erUSUL	gNewPower	newer xorg releases do not need a xorg.conf to work; so none is there by default. if one is present it is used though
2010-07-01T21:38:00.000Z	gNewPower	erUSUL	ok, but then were is the current X config written?
2010-07-01T21:40:00.000Z	erUSUL	gNewPower	it is in Xoerg memory. if you do "sudo Xorg -configure" it is written to /root/ iirc
2010-07-01T21:40:00.000Z	erUSUL	gNewPower	you have to stop the xerver first afaik
2010-07-01T21:41:00.000Z	gNewPower	erUSUL	yes. how do I do that?  ctrl+alt+backspace does not work any more
2010-07-01T21:42:00.000Z	erUSUL	gNewPower	try this first « sudo Xorg -configure :1 »
2010-07-01T21:50:00.000Z	gNewPower	erUSUL	it did create a fjle under /root/xorg.conf .I have to tell you that I am using a live-CD of Xubuntu.  The reason for that is that my Xubuntu 10.04 live-CD configures my X correctly up to 1400x1050) while my HD install of Ubuntu does not (maxL 1024x768).  I am trying to find a way to transfer the values of X under the Xubuntu live-CD to my hard drive X config.  Is that possible?  (In the good old days, all which was needed was copy xorg.
2010-07-01T21:50:00.000Z	erUSUL	gNewPower	copy it
2010-07-01T21:51:00.000Z	erUSUL	gNewPower	as i said if it is in /etc/X11/xorg.conf it will be used
2010-07-01T21:52:00.000Z	gNewPower	erUSUL	ok. I will copy and reboot and hope that my HD install will use it as you said. brb in a couple of mins.
2010-07-01T21:53:00.000Z	erUSUL	gNewPower	if you are in the livecd you have to copy from /root/xorg.conf to /mnt/ubuntu_hd_install/etc/X11/ ( given 5that you mounted your ubuntu hd install in /mnt/ubuntu_hd_install )
2010-07-01T21:53:00.000Z	gNewPower	erUSUL	I understand. will do that now. brb
2010-07-01T22:00:00.000Z	gNewPower	erUSUL	it did not work. for some reason I got a message saying that it Ubuntu was starting in a lowres config and then it when right back to the bad old 1024X768.  Somehow at bootup X is reconfigured each time I think.
2010-07-01T22:03:00.000Z	gNewPower	erUSUL	?
2010-07-01T22:04:00.000Z	erUSUL	gNewPower	dunno; it should have followed that file
2010-07-01T22:04:00.000Z	gNewPower	erUSUL	ok. thanks for trying!  I really appreciate it. cheers!
