2007-11-03T06:18:00.000Z	sung		so
2007-11-03T06:18:00.000Z	sung		hi guys
2007-11-03T06:19:00.000Z	sung		how are ya'll doing?
2007-11-03T06:19:00.000Z	aeg1s	sung	great, thanks
2007-11-03T06:19:00.000Z	sung	aeg1s	excellent
2007-11-03T06:19:00.000Z	aeg1s	sung	just learned how to do encfs
2007-11-03T06:19:00.000Z	sung		quick question: i compiled a custom kernel so that i could compile lirc-modules and get this stupid remote working (had to add a single line to lirc_mceusb2)
2007-11-03T06:20:00.000Z	sung		now, after reboot, i can't use the nvidia "restricted driver" (so video sucks)
2007-11-03T06:20:00.000Z	sung		and then sound doesn't work at all
2007-11-03T06:20:00.000Z	sung		lspci shows the card there ( durr )
2007-11-03T06:20:00.000Z	sung		but alsa doesn't see it all
2007-11-03T06:20:00.000Z	sung		ideally, i'd go back to running the normal generic kernel, and replace the kernel module lirc_mceusb2 with the new one
2007-11-03T06:20:00.000Z	sung		is there some way of doing that?
2007-11-03T06:21:00.000Z	aeg1s	sung	did you get the specific driver from the alsa site for your soundcard?
2007-11-03T06:21:00.000Z	sung		specifically compiling lirc_mceusb2 os that it'd work with the normal generic kernel (even though i had to compile a custom one to get it all working)
2007-11-03T06:21:00.000Z	sung	aeg1s	nope, it was working on original install
2007-11-03T06:22:00.000Z	aeg1s	sung	I had a problem getting multiple sounds (multi channel) and read the howto on installing the specific driver for your soundcard from the alsa sight... It works great now.  I did have to add a line to the modules file though.
2007-11-03T06:23:00.000Z	aeg1s	sung	I'm looking for the HOWTO for you...  maybe someone else has some answers too?
2007-11-03T06:42:00.000Z	sung	aeg1s	i took off my custom kernel
