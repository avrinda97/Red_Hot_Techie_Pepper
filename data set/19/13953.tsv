2004-12-30T07:22:00.000Z	joshua__		I dual boot between hoary and warty
2004-12-30T07:23:00.000Z	joshua__		ok, question if im using acclerated drivers on a 9700 pro what FPS should i get in glxgears
2004-12-30T07:25:00.000Z	joshua__		yea
2004-12-30T07:26:00.000Z	joshua__		no, linux distros dont like ati
2004-12-30T07:27:00.000Z	melazyboy	joshua__	Are you using xorg?
2004-12-30T07:27:00.000Z	joshua__	melazyboy	no, im in warty
2004-12-30T07:27:00.000Z	joshua__	melazyboy	but i get really horrible FPS in AA even with all the textures on super low and at the lowest possible resolution
2004-12-30T07:29:00.000Z	melazyboy	joshua__	2200 isn't horrible fps for an ATI card, just stick with XFree86, your card isn't supported yet with Hoary
2004-12-30T07:31:00.000Z	melazyboy	joshua__	Glxgears isn't really a benchmarking utility, if you get over 1k fps, then you have hardware acceleration, thats all it was ever really ment to test. And with the ATI card because the driver isn't open source, there isn't much you can do about it, simply said its working above 1kfps, so its working, you can make sure you don't have conflicting modules running, ie no 'ati', you should just have 'fglrx'
2004-12-30T07:32:00.000Z	melazyboy	joshua__	make sure 'dri' and 'ati' aren't loaded with lsmod
2004-12-30T07:32:00.000Z	joshua__	melazyboy	ok, one sec
2004-12-30T07:33:00.000Z	joshua__	melazyboy	no they arnt
2004-12-30T07:33:00.000Z	melazyboy	joshua__	if you see anything that looks suspecious of being a video module kill it
2004-12-30T07:33:00.000Z	joshua__	melazyboy	uhh, aside from fglrx i dont think so
2004-12-30T07:34:00.000Z	melazyboy	joshua__	In your xfree86, do you have the module 'fglrx' set under your primary display adapter?
2004-12-30T07:34:00.000Z	joshua__	melazyboy	yes i do... thats why i get 2600+ in fglrx
2004-12-30T07:34:00.000Z	joshua__	melazyboy	err, in glxgears
2004-12-30T07:36:00.000Z	joshua__	melazyboy	any clue?
2004-12-30T07:38:00.000Z	melazyboy	joshua__	2k fps, really isn't that shabby for a ATI 9600-9800 there windows drivers are sub par, and their linux drivers are even worse than their windows drivers -- sorry thats all i can tell you, i upgraded to hoary and haven't had 3d acceleration since. i wasn't aware of the incompatability between xorg/fglrx, needless to say i don't think there will be a fix, i think ati will eventually make the buisness move to drop linux supp
