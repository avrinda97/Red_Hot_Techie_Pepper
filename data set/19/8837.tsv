2009-02-11T20:14:00.000Z	ikonia	xrfang	the livecd is the installer cd
2009-02-11T20:15:00.000Z	xrfang	ikonia	yes I know, I just failed to burn the iso to a CD for 3 times, and I wonder I need to try again or not...
2009-02-11T20:15:00.000Z	ikonia	xrfang	have you md5'd the image ?
2009-02-11T20:16:00.000Z	xrfang	ikonia	yes I did, I downloaded twice, first one is wrong, 2nd one I downloaded through BT and did md5 it is correct.
2009-08-29T18:22:00.000Z	ikonia	xrfang	very well
2009-08-29T18:22:00.000Z	xrfang	ikonia	does wine have a 64bit version?
2009-08-29T18:22:00.000Z	ikonia	xrfang	dont think so
2009-08-29T18:23:00.000Z	ikonia	xrfang	some software yes
2009-08-29T18:26:00.000Z	ikonia	xrfang	no
2009-08-29T18:27:00.000Z	ikonia	xrfang	the average home user won't see a difference
2009-08-29T18:27:00.000Z	xrfang	ikonia	so it does not really make sense,
2009-08-29T18:27:00.000Z	ikonia	xrfang	sure it does
2009-08-29T18:28:00.000Z	ikonia	xrfang	for the average home user at this time - very little
2012-01-04T17:58:00.000Z	ikonia	xrfang	be very careful, as if you switch to testing it may upgrade other things as dependencies, which are then hardware to downgrade
2012-01-04T17:59:00.000Z	xrfang	ikonia	I don't understand, you mean, switch to "testing" is GLOBAL, not for a specific program?
2012-01-04T17:59:00.000Z	ikonia	xrfang	depends on the repo, if your repo contains only one application, then yes, if it's a development repo with more than that one application, then no, you'd have to look at application "pinning"
2012-01-04T18:00:00.000Z	xrfang	ikonia	so you are saying that the "global" I asked, apply to a specific repo, not all entries in the source.list file, right?
2012-01-04T18:01:00.000Z	ikonia	xrfang	if you add a repo that contains 200 packages, then those 200 packages will be available for upgrade
2012-01-04T18:01:00.000Z	ikonia	xrfang	if you add a repo with 1 application, only that one will be available
