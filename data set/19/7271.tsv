2007-09-17T14:54:00.000Z	Tommck		I am currently running Dapper Drake.  I want to get to a higher kernel version.  Is the simplest thing upgrading the whole OS?  Or is there an easy way to get a > 2.6.16 kernel?
2007-09-17T14:56:00.000Z	Tommck		I want to upgrade Dapper... should I just go to Edgy?  Feisty?  or what?
2007-09-17T14:56:00.000Z	Tommck		sorry for the bold
2007-09-17T14:57:00.000Z	Tommck		this usually works quite well?
2007-09-17T14:57:00.000Z	Tommck		I'm tentative.  I have never done this kind of upgrade
2007-09-17T14:58:00.000Z	NessieLiberaton	Tommck	you can go dapper->edgy->feisty, or you can download the iso for a cd of feisty/(gutsy soon) and install from scratch
2007-09-17T14:58:00.000Z	NessieLiberaton	Tommck	otherwise it's about 2 days of updates or more :P
2007-09-17T14:58:00.000Z	Tommck	NessieLiberaton	- yeah... what I really need is a newer kernel than Dapper offers
2007-09-17T14:59:00.000Z	NessieLiberaton	Tommck	it would be quicker to download the iso, burn it and install feisty/gutsy from scratch than it would be to go through them all
2007-09-17T15:00:00.000Z	Tommck	NessieLiberaton	- and Gutsy's been pretty stable?  I've been a bit out of the loop
2007-09-17T15:00:00.000Z	NessieLiberaton	Tommck	well unless you're brave - you might wanna wait a month before gutsy - i run it and it's fine... but hey
2007-09-17T15:01:00.000Z	NessieLiberaton	Tommck	if you know what you're doing, and it's not a critical computer - it might be fun ;)
2007-09-17T15:02:00.000Z	Tommck	NessieLiberaton	- yeah... it won't be a big deal.. I just don't have the time now
2007-09-17T15:02:00.000Z	NessieLiberaton	Tommck	you should be able to choose the older kernel at grub on boot
2007-09-17T15:02:00.000Z	Tommck	NessieLiberaton	- it's in a wiring closet... is there a way to do it outside of the grub menu?
2007-09-17T15:03:00.000Z	NessieLiberaton	Tommck	the um, dont you see the grub menu when you boot ?
2007-09-17T15:03:00.000Z	Tommck	NessieLiberaton	- I would have to shove myself into a closet to see it... and I would have to drag a monitor in there too
2007-09-17T15:04:00.000Z	NessieLiberaton	Tommck	it's a server? you could edit the grub menu - but that's something i'd avoid doing unless you're sure
2007-09-17T15:04:00.000Z	Tommck	NessieLiberaton	- yeah.. it's a MythTV backend
