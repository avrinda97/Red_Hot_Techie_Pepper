2012-05-28T23:50:00.000Z	waxstone		my computer randomly freezes when I use the default installed firefox on 12.04. Having no issues when using Chromium. Can anyone help me solve this?
2012-05-28T23:52:00.000Z	waxstone		add near quiet splash
2012-05-28T23:54:00.000Z	escott	waxstone	any pattern to when it freezes? flash games? webgl?
2012-05-29T00:02:00.000Z	waxstone	escott	no pattern. I first though it was related to movies or having multiple windows open but then  a few times ubuntu froze as it opened after booting up.
2012-05-29T00:02:00.000Z	escott	waxstone	how hard a freeze is it? do keys like numlock light up? can you REISUB (see !sysrq)?
2012-05-29T00:04:00.000Z	waxstone	escott	I never looked for lights but i can't reach any terminals. i.e. CTRL+ALT+F1. Keyboard and mouse  freeze
2012-05-29T00:05:00.000Z	waxstone	escott	I definitely try that trick as I hate forceing a shut down. should I try to freeze now to test?
2012-05-29T00:06:00.000Z	escott	waxstone	if you are in the mode to try and check sure. you can look at things like /var/log/syslog when you get back and see if there is anything listed
2012-05-29T00:06:00.000Z	waxstone	escott	well I definitely prefer firefox so here goes
2012-05-29T00:15:00.000Z	waxstone	escott	froze without being able to REISUB. capslock & numlock light could not toggled. checking syslog be toggled
2012-05-29T00:18:00.000Z	waxstone	escott	not seeing anything tha scream ERROR WARNING WARNING
2012-05-29T00:24:00.000Z	escott	waxstone	if you cant reisub it is unlikely anything will make it to the logs
