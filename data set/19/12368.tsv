2006-09-22T07:28:00.000Z	lostboyz		hi how do i make my old home folder my new home folder? i am a suse transplant
2006-09-22T07:28:00.000Z	Flannel	lostboyz	just edit your fstab to mount your old one in plcae
2006-09-22T07:31:00.000Z	Flannel	lostboyz	ubotu sent you a link, read it ;)  no need to use ubuntuguide
2006-09-22T08:22:00.000Z	Flannel	lostboyz	you could always mount your other one inside this one, or ditch the small one and just use the big one
2006-09-22T08:23:00.000Z	Flannel	lostboyz	which one?
2006-09-22T08:25:00.000Z	Flannel	lostboyz	change your fstab, to not mount the small one as home, and to mount the big one as home.
2006-09-22T08:25:00.000Z	Flannel	lostboyz	are you sharing this home between OSs? or switching entirely?
2006-09-22T08:27:00.000Z	Flannel	lostboyz	alright.  What you'llw ant to do is remove any config files you may have, or at the very least copy over your ubuntu ones (from your current home folder) to the new one, because the config syntaxes might be different between program versions
2006-09-22T08:27:00.000Z	Flannel	lostboyz	and then just switch the mount point, and you'll be fine
2006-09-22T08:28:00.000Z	Flannel	lostboyz	all inside ~
2006-09-22T08:29:00.000Z	Flannel	lostboyz	~ is the path of your home directory, which can also be written as /home/username/
2006-09-22T08:29:00.000Z	Flannel	lostboyz	you'll want to copy your ubuntu stuff over, make sure you get the hidden stuff too (those are folders/files that start with a .)
2006-09-22T08:30:00.000Z	Flannel	lostboyz	what you could/probably should do, is delete all the config stuff from your old home, just keep your personal data stuff in there, and then copy everything over, then you won't have to worry about mitigating conflicts, etc
2006-09-22T08:36:00.000Z	Flannel	lostboyz	remove all config files, usually they're .programname, either as a folder or a file.  then copy everything from your current ubuntu home, then fstab change, yep.
2006-09-22T08:38:00.000Z	Flannel	lostboyz	sure, you'll need to tweak your user though
2006-09-22T08:38:00.000Z	Flannel	lostboyz	you can also do it via GUI in the users menu thing
2006-09-22T09:06:00.000Z	Flannel	lostboyz	change the umask in your fstab
2006-09-22T09:07:00.000Z	Flannel	lostboyz	or, use sudo to make yourself that user (sudo -u name)
2006-09-22T09:08:00.000Z	Flannel	lostboyz	you'll want to chown the whole thing then, probably
