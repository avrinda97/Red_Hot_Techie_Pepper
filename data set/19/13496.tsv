2005-03-30T09:54:00.000Z	Absenth		I don't suppose anyone knows off the top of their head which commands I need to run to reconfigure the nvidia kernel module.
2005-03-30T09:54:00.000Z	Absenth		I just changed to the k7 specific kernel, and currently x won't boot with the "nvidia" driver.
2005-03-30T09:55:00.000Z	Absenth		it's failing on the kernel module.  I know on fedora I just re-ran the .run script, but I have no idea where apt puts such things.
2005-03-30T09:57:00.000Z	Absenth		Ells, I've got Crossover running.

2005-03-30T10:00:00.000Z	Absenth	ells	nope, they sure aren't
2005-03-30T10:00:00.000Z	ells	Absenth	so how do you run your files, just curious
2005-03-30T10:00:00.000Z	Absenth	ells	I guess I haven't tried Crossover since upgrading to Hoary.
2005-03-30T10:01:00.000Z	ells	Absenth	after you install in hoary, you have to use it by going thru console.
2005-03-30T10:01:00.000Z	ells	Absenth	you have to install all your programs when you install crossover
2005-03-30T10:02:00.000Z	ells	Absenth	can you use any of your programs
2005-03-30T10:03:00.000Z	Absenth	ells	currently no, but the only program I had installed on this machine was acrobat reader.
2005-03-30T10:04:00.000Z	ells	Absenth	you will have to go thru console go to the file and ./file
