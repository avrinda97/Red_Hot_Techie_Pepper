2012-09-14T00:12:00.000Z	HoNgOuRu		hi, i have a problem
2012-09-14T00:12:00.000Z	HoNgOuRu		I want to make a script that runs a ssh commans
2012-09-14T00:12:00.000Z	HoNgOuRu		command
2012-09-14T00:12:00.000Z	HoNgOuRu		but it asks for the ssh password
2012-09-14T00:12:00.000Z	HoNgOuRu		I want to do all in a single line
2012-09-14T00:12:00.000Z	HoNgOuRu		is that possible ?
2012-09-14T00:12:00.000Z	beandog	HoNgOuRu	yah, use public keys without a passphrase
2012-09-14T00:13:00.000Z	HoNgOuRu	beandog	there has to be a generic way
2012-09-14T00:14:00.000Z	beandog	HoNgOuRu	that's pretty generic
2012-09-14T00:14:00.000Z	beandog	HoNgOuRu	you could setup keys between the two boxes and use those as a requirement
2012-09-14T00:14:00.000Z	beandog	HoNgOuRu	er, certs
2012-09-14T00:14:00.000Z	HoNgOuRu	beandog	forget about ssh
2012-09-14T00:16:00.000Z	beandog	HoNgOuRu	yes, using yes
2012-09-14T00:16:00.000Z	HoNgOuRu	beandog	how ?
2012-09-14T00:16:00.000Z	beandog	HoNgOuRu	for one command, that is.  But if you're talking about scripts versus ssh, then I'm not gonna get into that.
2012-09-14T00:16:00.000Z	beandog	HoNgOuRu	fex, yes y | install.sh
2012-09-14T00:16:00.000Z	HoNgOuRu	beandog	ill try that
2012-09-14T00:22:00.000Z	HoNgOuRu	beandog	that is now working as I would like
2012-09-14T00:22:00.000Z	beandog	HoNgOuRu	kk
