2005-11-09T06:13:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	eedge	: the ubuntu avcodec.h is fscked up
2005-11-09T06:13:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	eedge	: mplayer ppl recommend you just delete it as most packages include it anyway
2005-11-09T06:14:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	eedge	: so just locate avcodec.h    and   mv file backup
2005-11-09T06:17:00.000Z	eedge	lsuactiafner	don't I need that file at all then?
2005-11-09T06:18:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	eedge	: well, gave me more problems than its worth.. and i installed ffmpeg myself.. and you can just move the file to the same place its now... but with _backup @ its end.. and your compile might just work..
2005-11-09T06:21:00.000Z	eedge	lsuactiafner	renamed to avcodec.h to avcodec.backup and got same errors on make
2005-11-09T06:22:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	eedge	: link to the source code? let me see if it works for me

2005-11-09T06:25:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	eedge	: anything else is too expensive in south-africa..
2005-11-09T06:27:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	eedge	: i have checking for bmp >= 0.9.7 no.. so check bur[n] er's link.. else i'll have to install a dependancy...
