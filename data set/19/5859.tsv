2008-08-09T21:38:00.000Z	andresmh		i ignored and tried sudo apt-get install firefox-3.0 but i still got the E: Couldn't find package firefox-3.0 error
2008-08-09T21:38:00.000Z	andresmh		oh
2008-08-09T21:38:00.000Z	andresmh		i guess i should get rid of my unsupported repo
2008-08-09T21:38:00.000Z	andresmh		how do i remove the unsupported repo? i don't even remember how i added that
2008-08-09T21:38:00.000Z	andresmh		it's been a while since i haven't used this machine
2008-08-09T21:39:00.000Z	nickrud	andresmh	it'll be in /etc/apt/sources.list or a file in /etc/apt/sources.list.d
2008-08-09T21:42:00.000Z	nickrud	andresmh	hardy?
2008-08-09T21:46:00.000Z	andresmh	nickrud	i have feisty
2008-08-09T21:47:00.000Z	nickrud	andresmh	put a copy of your /etc/apt/sources.list on paste.ubuntu.com
2008-12-31T13:06:00.000Z	nickrud	andresmh	some; backports essentially scratches some dev's itch.
2008-12-31T13:07:00.000Z	andresmh	nickrud	are backports way too risky?
2008-12-31T13:07:00.000Z	nickrud	andresmh	not really. I usually just enable it, install what I want, then disable
2008-12-31T13:08:00.000Z	nickrud	andresmh	I also use some ppa's, but those are more iffy. Really depends on who's maintaining it
2008-12-31T13:11:00.000Z	nickrud	andresmh	they're for individual dev's or teams to push out test packages for stuff that's not readily available. And right now, no ppa's. I've used a couple for compiz stuff and fixes to wireless, but everythings ok for me right now
2008-12-31T13:12:00.000Z	nickrud	andresmh	I'
2008-12-31T13:15:00.000Z	andresmh	nickrud	how do you go about finding the URL of a PPA? like for example i want to find the PPA for intrepid for cheese, I googled it but nothing useful comes up...
2008-12-31T13:15:00.000Z	nickrud	andresmh	when jaunty comes out, you'll be offered a chance to upgrade to jaunty during an update-manager run
2008-12-31T13:17:00.000Z	nickrud	andresmh	I've usually found references to them in bug reports ;)
2008-12-31T13:18:00.000Z	nickrud	andresmh	I didn't see your problem, why you want a ppa: is it for your webcam?
