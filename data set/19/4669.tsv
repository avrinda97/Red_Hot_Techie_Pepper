2009-02-08T06:24:00.000Z	terr_		I'm still looking for suggestions on a small low power box for a web server
2009-02-08T06:24:00.000Z	MoTec	terr_	fit-pc v1.0 highly discounted currenty
2009-02-08T06:24:00.000Z	MoTec	terr_	under 5w power.. .you'll not find lower :)
2009-02-08T06:24:00.000Z	terr_	MoTec	not bad
2009-02-08T06:24:00.000Z	terr_	MoTec	used equipment is fine too.
2009-02-08T06:26:00.000Z	MoTec	terr_	then definately give the fit-pc 1.0 a look.  fit-pc.com
2009-02-08T06:27:00.000Z	terr_	MoTec	that isn't much of a percentage decline
2009-02-08T06:27:00.000Z	terr_	MoTec	ya sure - you were being a clown I think
2009-02-08T06:29:00.000Z	terr_	MoTec	have a peak at the HP netbook 1000MI  ($387 starting price I hear)
2009-02-08T06:30:00.000Z	MoTec	terr_	i love my dell mini 9 :)
2009-02-08T06:30:00.000Z	terr_	MoTec	that little fit-PC sure looks interesting.  I wonder about a solid state HDD?
2009-02-08T06:30:00.000Z	MoTec	terr_	yeah, it'll support a ssd or a compact flash via adapter
2009-02-08T06:31:00.000Z	terr_	MoTec	I want something relaiable of course - I expect these are... also how many NICS if I want to use as a firewall?
2009-02-08T06:31:00.000Z	MoTec	terr_	i've been using a couple as routers/firewalls for a couple years
2009-02-08T06:31:00.000Z	MoTec	terr_	I use pfsense on them.. it's insanely great :)
2009-02-08T06:31:00.000Z	terr_	MoTec	not bad - the webservers I currently ahve are very reliable... and they help heat my house so I can save on my gas bill
2009-02-08T06:32:00.000Z	terr_	MoTec	I'm going to cehck out OpenBSD for the firewalling
2009-02-08T06:32:00.000Z	MoTec	terr_	that's what pfsense is based on... check it out for sure.
2009-02-08T06:45:00.000Z	MoTec	terr_	you can run virtual box on many os's including windows and ubuntu
