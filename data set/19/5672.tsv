2009-06-02T17:52:00.000Z	unr3a1		is there a way to override the routers DNS from within Linux?
2009-06-02T17:52:00.000Z	unr3a1		like can I manually set my own DNS settings while still getting an IP from DHCP?
2009-06-02T17:52:00.000Z	beli	unr3a1	/etc/resolv.conf
2009-06-02T17:53:00.000Z	beli	unr3a1	edit /etc/resolv.conf
2009-06-02T17:54:00.000Z	unr3a1	beli	what changes do I make?
2009-06-02T17:54:00.000Z	beli	unr3a1	read the manual....man 5 resolv.conf
2009-06-02T17:59:00.000Z	beli	unr3a1	sure...you can also give it an internal name...edit /etc/hosts for that
2009-06-02T17:59:00.000Z	beli	unr3a1	i also recommend you to read the nag2
2009-06-02T17:59:00.000Z	beli	unr3a1	it has all about basic linux networking
2009-06-02T18:01:00.000Z	beli	unr3a1	most config stuff goes to /etc/ or /etc/yourapp/  you get information about the location by reading the manual of your application...
2009-06-02T18:09:00.000Z	beli	unr3a1	always use ips
2009-06-02T18:10:00.000Z	unr3a1	beli	always use ips for what?
2009-06-02T18:11:00.000Z	beli	unr3a1	if you define a nameserver, never use a host name ;) thats paradox
2009-06-02T18:11:00.000Z	unr3a1	beli	oh ok
2009-06-02T18:11:00.000Z	unr3a1	beli	so I can leave domain and search blank then?
2009-06-02T18:12:00.000Z	unr3a1	beli	I am sorry for asking so many questions, its just I am confused now.... lol
2009-06-02T18:12:00.000Z	beli	unr3a1	thats why i told you to read some stuff....
2009-06-02T18:13:00.000Z	beli	unr3a1	askin questions and getting full solutions doesnt help you to learn
