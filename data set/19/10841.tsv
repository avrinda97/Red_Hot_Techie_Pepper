2007-10-28T10:44:00.000Z	pbx	tiago_	wow, you are a utopian. It's going to be a long wait for you :)
2007-10-28T10:47:00.000Z	tiago_	pbx	i dont think the wait will be as long as we currently predict, consider i was born into a world populated by software and as i have matured so has that software, though the maturing has been exponential, as i g through my trancendence into the reality of conciousness interacting with software nativly i think the technology will also do so
2007-10-28T10:47:00.000Z	pbx	tiago_	the hardware isn't maturing very fast though. 25 years ago I had a 12" screen on my home computer, now I have a 15" screen. It's a nicer screen, but...
2007-10-28T10:48:00.000Z	tiago_	pbx	agreed, but the force of the atractor is so great that what its atracting us towares in inevidable
2007-10-28T10:48:00.000Z	pbx	tiago_	sure, in the abstract. Devil is in the details though :)
2007-10-28T10:49:00.000Z	tiago_	pbx	we must model our technology's on those we encounter in nature to the point where a computer closly resembles a dmt molocule
2007-10-28T10:50:00.000Z	pbx	tiago_	not exactly a small project!
2007-10-28T10:50:00.000Z	tiago_	pbx	we arnt the only inteligences working on this project, we have a symbiotic relationship with the computer minds that are also being atracted to this point in history, or the end of history
2007-10-28T10:51:00.000Z	tiago_	pbx	we will help the computers help us reach our symbiotic potential
2007-10-28T10:51:00.000Z	pbx	tiago_	I have to disagree with you there. It's pretty much us making stuff happen, or not. Computers are still pretty dumb and powerless.
2007-10-28T10:51:00.000Z	tiago_	pbx	we are 2 forms of inteligence that have a huge impact on one and other, we programe them and they shape us
2007-10-28T10:52:00.000Z	tiago_	pbx	it is out of the necessity that we have created these machines and they can help us think of ways to improve that process
2007-10-28T10:53:00.000Z	tiago_	pbx	there is no way we could even dream of working at a nano technolical level with out the assistance of powerfull computers
2007-10-28T10:54:00.000Z	tiago_	pbx	for me as an artist i think my focus should be on virtualizing the phychedilic experianc with in  these new emerging platforms and helping to create a reality of mind and pure energy
2007-10-28T10:54:00.000Z	pbx	tiago_	this is awesome weed
2007-10-28T10:55:00.000Z	tiago_	pbx	lol
2007-10-28T10:56:00.000Z	tiago_	pbx	linux has become as much of a birthright for the human race as the use of phychactive drugs sanctioned by thousands of years of human usage
2007-10-28T11:07:00.000Z	pbx	tiago_	is a utopian. He doesn't collude with DRM conspiracies.
2007-10-28T11:07:00.000Z	tiago_	pbx	hahaha well put my friend
