2009-07-11T15:23:00.000Z	josefig		i tried to open cfdisk and it said: cannot open disk, what can I do? could be because i partitioned with win vista manager system?
2009-07-11T15:23:00.000Z	racecar56	josefig	possible
2009-07-11T15:24:00.000Z	josefig	racecar56	now what can I do?
2009-07-11T15:25:00.000Z	racecar56	josefig	you might have to use gparted and re-format those partitions :'(
2009-07-11T15:25:00.000Z	josefig	racecar56	omg, really? i guessed there was another solution :s
2009-07-11T15:26:00.000Z	racecar56	josefig	i don't know, talk with others too because i havent used vista in ages
2009-07-11T15:26:00.000Z	racecar56	josefig	PLEASE don't try my advice unless it's at last resort
2009-07-11T15:27:00.000Z	josefig	racecar56	i gonna cry, 'cos i was usin' ubuntu but i can't live without my slacky (:x) so i tried to install it but i faced with this tiny problem lol :s
2009-07-11T15:28:00.000Z	racecar56	josefig	don't try to reformat them yet
2009-07-11T15:28:00.000Z	racecar56	josefig	you ARE talking about windows vista's partition thingy right?
2009-07-11T15:28:00.000Z	racecar56	josefig	that u used?
2009-07-11T15:29:00.000Z	josefig	racecar56	the manager system, amm start>system right click and manage :s
2009-07-11T15:29:00.000Z	racecar56	josefig	yea, thats it
2009-07-11T15:30:00.000Z	josefig	racecar56	yep and you know i checked today the partitions and the fu..ing vista says that i have no used any kb yet from these partitions lol and in ubuntu says i used 79% from 1 partition
2009-07-11T15:31:00.000Z	racecar56	josefig	what the heck, probably because windows is evil and they don't bother reading info about extX partitions
2009-07-11T15:31:00.000Z	josefig	racecar56	perhaps, damn it.
2009-07-11T15:32:00.000Z	racecar56	josefig	hmm, ah well
2009-07-11T15:38:00.000Z	racecar56	josefig	"bash: /home/racecar56/.Trash: No such file or directory" apparently not for me either
2009-07-11T15:38:00.000Z	racecar56	josefig	and i have a command line install built with xorg and all that
