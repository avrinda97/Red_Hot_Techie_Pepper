2012-09-07T14:13:00.000Z	BlueWolf	MonkeyDust	baizon: Thank you much better :D
2012-09-11T16:27:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	BlueWolf	 what's Spore?
2012-09-11T16:27:00.000Z	BlueWolf	MonkeyDust	Spore is a windows game that allows one to make such characters

2012-10-03T21:28:00.000Z	BlueWolf	MonkeyDust	tsimpson: Ok so it would be better to get Alternate install CD for 64-bit PC (AMD64)?
2012-10-04T01:12:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	BlueWolf	 TJ- I use fallback/classic , it's very similar to gnome2
2012-10-04T01:14:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	BlueWolf	 "good" depends on what you like
2012-10-04T01:14:00.000Z	BlueWolf	MonkeyDust	Something Like Ubuntu?
2012-10-04T01:24:00.000Z	BlueWolf	MonkeyDust	Thanks for your help.
2012-10-08T13:51:00.000Z	BlueWolf	MonkeyDust	Do I have to manually partition the Ubuntu partitions or will it do it atomatically?
2012-10-08T13:52:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	BlueWolf	 my advice : do it manually, so you know what it is and what happens -- partitioning is the hardest part, it kept me from using linux years ago
2012-10-08T13:54:00.000Z	BlueWolf	MonkeyDust	Sorry I am just struggling to understand How and what to do, a break in communication. It just seems that 10.04 is easier to install than 12.04?
2012-10-08T13:55:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	BlueWolf	 no, the installer is the same, it's the number of partitions that makes it look hard, i advice a separate /home
2012-10-08T19:00:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	BlueWolf	 i'm 'tr√®s happy' with fallback
2012-10-08T19:02:00.000Z	BlueWolf	MonkeyDust	Does compiz work with ubuntu 12.04 because I remember that it clashed with Unity when I use 11.04
2012-10-08T19:03:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	BlueWolf	 unity is gnome3 with compiz, so yes
