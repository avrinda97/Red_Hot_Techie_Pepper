2010-03-23T14:34:00.000Z	mobius2		well ,  does anybody know how to uninstall system updates?
2010-03-23T14:34:00.000Z	mobius2		in the groups that they were installed BY the manager in ?
2010-03-23T14:34:00.000Z	mobius2		jeese I find that hard to believe
2010-03-23T14:35:00.000Z	Gnea	mobius2	why do you think it's hard to believe?
2010-03-23T14:36:00.000Z	Gnea	mobius2	judging it as such doesn't really solve your problem,does it?
2010-03-23T14:36:00.000Z	mobius2	Gnea	 you got that right
2010-03-23T14:37:00.000Z	Gnea	mobius2	this is open source software. if you want it fixed, fix it yourself or file a proper bug report.
2010-03-23T14:38:00.000Z	mobius2	Gnea	thanks for that
2010-03-23T14:38:00.000Z	Gnea	mobius2	judging it only makes *you* look weak. pretty sure you don't want that.
2010-03-23T14:38:00.000Z	mobius2	Gnea	 thanks for that
2010-03-23T14:38:00.000Z	Gnea	mobius2	feel free to drop the attitude while you're at it
2010-03-23T14:40:00.000Z	Gnea	mobius2	I'm sorry that you feel that way.
2010-03-23T14:40:00.000Z	mobius2	Gnea	go help someone and stop wasting time
2011-02-10T14:11:00.000Z	Gnea	mobius2	it won't run in wine?
2011-02-10T14:12:00.000Z	mobius2	Gnea	 I've gone as far as Crossover pro, which uses the wine framework, and last night I actually installed an xp and vista instance under vmware, but it seems un useably slow...besides I just cant beleive there is not an .fla editor for linux :P
2011-02-10T14:15:00.000Z	Gnea	mobius2	I can assure you that there is no .fla editor for linux :)
2011-02-10T14:16:00.000Z	mobius2	Gnea	 I see
2011-02-10T14:17:00.000Z	Gnea	mobius2	however, virtualbox works quite well if you have the resources
