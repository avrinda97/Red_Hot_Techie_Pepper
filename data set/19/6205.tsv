2008-05-17T22:13:00.000Z	keymoo_	heymr	and xorg.conf is http://paste.ubuntu.com/12759/
2008-05-17T22:15:00.000Z	heymr	keymoo_	oh, NVIDIA, eh? You can get more then that... use the nv driver, or get the driver you need from the nVidia website, they have linux drivers
2008-05-17T22:15:00.000Z	heymr	keymoo_	sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg when you get a chance (this might have to kill X)
