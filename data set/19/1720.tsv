2010-10-20T05:10:00.000Z	djanatan		Why is my mic not working in 64-bit when it worked in 32-bit Fedora?
2010-10-20T05:10:00.000Z	djanatan		Everything is turned up in Alsamixer.
2010-10-20T05:11:00.000Z	Benkinooby	djanatan	different drivers?
2010-10-20T05:12:00.000Z	djanatan	Benkinooby	I can't imagine why I would need drivers for a soundcard that's worked fine in everything else, not to mention that sound output works perfectly.
2010-10-20T05:13:00.000Z	Benkinooby	djanatan	are you under gome?
2010-10-20T05:13:00.000Z	djanatan	Benkinooby	Xfce.
2010-10-20T05:13:00.000Z	Benkinooby	djanatan	open a terminal and type 'alsamixer'
2010-10-20T05:14:00.000Z	Benkinooby	djanatan	then press the key F5
2010-10-20T05:14:00.000Z	Benkinooby	djanatan	now check all settings.  you can navigate with the arrow keys
2010-10-20T05:15:00.000Z	djanatan	Benkinooby	I'm not exactly new. ;) Everything is at 100%.
2010-10-20T05:15:00.000Z	Benkinooby	djanatan	take special care about the boosters and also check if nothing is muted
2010-10-20T05:15:00.000Z	Benkinooby	djanatan	oh sorry, didn't know
2010-10-20T05:16:00.000Z	Benkinooby	djanatan	but still it might be possible that do forgot to enable capture for the mic
2010-10-20T05:17:00.000Z	Benkinooby	djanatan	what was the matter?
2010-10-20T05:17:00.000Z	djanatan	Benkinooby	I meant about Matr|x
2010-10-20T05:18:00.000Z	Benkinooby	djanatan	i know
2010-10-20T05:20:00.000Z	Benkinooby	djanatan	but after 5 minutes i stoped reading his messages and threw a D<))))8> for the troll
2010-10-20T05:20:00.000Z	Benkinooby	djanatan	so i guess you allready tried lspci and stuff?
2010-10-20T05:22:00.000Z	Benkinooby	djanatan	so the laptop/compters mic does not work but if you use a headset it works?
