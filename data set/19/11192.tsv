2006-09-01T09:43:00.000Z	spunk		I'm trying to debug a problem I have with 'esd'. Q: Should /etc/esound/esd.conf  have "auto_spawn=1" ?
2006-09-01T09:44:00.000Z	spunk		Does anyone know exactly how 'esd' is lanuched during startup? By gdm?
2006-09-01T09:45:00.000Z	kitche	spunk	it is probably lauched when sound uses it if you have it set up right, sicne I know nothing uses it directly
2006-09-01T09:46:00.000Z	spunk	kitche	Ok. It seems that esd gets launched twice during startup. Do you have any idea why?
2006-09-01T09:48:00.000Z	kitche	spunk	not really but esd is the enlightenment sound daemon correct?
2006-09-01T09:48:00.000Z	spunk	kitche	that is, I have two esd processes running, none is a "child process" of the other... So I suspect that esd is started twice. Also, in .xsession-errors, there are some complaints about "stale socket" for esd.
2006-09-01T09:49:00.000Z	spunk	kitche	I dont know. :-) I only know that gnome uses it...?
2006-09-01T09:50:00.000Z	spunk	kitche	this have worked berfore, and I have not tampered with anything lately. :-)   Wierd thing; if I boot every other time in "failsafe" mode, it works great during a normal boot.
2006-09-01T09:50:00.000Z	spunk	kitche	yes, when I login, gnome gets stalled. When i killall esd, it continues. The USB mouse is sluggish too...
2006-09-01T09:51:00.000Z	kitche	spunk	hmm probably has something on how esd is set up
2006-09-01T09:51:00.000Z	kitche	spunk	well I don't know to much about usb mouses since I use my usb as a ps2
2006-09-01T09:52:00.000Z	spunk	kitche	The mouse thing seems related to my problem with esd. When I do the every-second boot in "failsafe" the mouse works fine...
2006-09-01T09:52:00.000Z	spunk	kitche	First i thought that the esd problem had to do with an old socket in /tmp. but now I dont know...
2006-09-01T09:53:00.000Z	spunk	kitche	I've tried to set auto_spawn=0 in /etc/esound/esd.conf to, but at no avail. :-(
2006-09-01T09:53:00.000Z	kitche	spunk	well did you delete the sock? since it's usually respawned on a boot anyways
2006-09-01T09:54:00.000Z	spunk	kitche	yes, i did. I suspect thats why it also works every other time I boot in "failsafe", the socket gets whiped at startup...
2006-09-01T09:55:00.000Z	kitche	spunk	at least it temporary fix your problem
2006-09-01T09:56:00.000Z	spunk	kitche	yes, true, I'll try it. Thanks for the help!
2006-09-01T09:56:00.000Z	spunk	kitche	overridden: I've to leave, thanks for the help! I'll return later. :-P
