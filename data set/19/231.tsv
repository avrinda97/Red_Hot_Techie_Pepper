2012-06-08T10:29:00.000Z	Kliment		Hello everyone. I'm the maintainer of a multiplatform wx app and a user of mine is reporting a really strange problem. Since the latest Ubuntu update they are seeing a missing attribute error in several wx classes when accessed from Python.
2012-06-08T10:30:00.000Z	Kliment		The same application worked correctly before the latest update, and now wx is broken to the point even wx.version() will not work
2012-06-08T10:31:00.000Z	Kliment		I'm not at all sure how to approach the problem.
2012-06-08T10:31:00.000Z	mz|`	Kliment	a paste may help ;) and the versions of system/python/else
2012-06-08T10:31:00.000Z	Kliment	mz|`	https://github.com/kliment/Printrun/issues/235
2012-06-08T10:32:00.000Z	Kliment	mz|`	Is that useful? I've had another independent report since, I cannot reproduce it myself.
2012-06-08T10:32:00.000Z	Kliment	mz|`	I asked them to install libwxgtk2.8-dev in case it's a dependency issue
2012-06-08T10:32:00.000Z	Kliment		But wx seems to be there, just not all of it
2012-06-08T10:33:00.000Z	mz|`	Kliment	seems other people also have this issue after an upgrade to 12.04 : http://pastebin.com/NkqqnnaY
2012-06-08T10:33:00.000Z	Kliment	mz|`	Yes that's one of my users too
2012-06-08T10:34:00.000Z	mz|`	Kliment	oh well
2012-06-08T10:35:00.000Z	mz|`		print wx.version() -> print wx.__version__ ?
2012-06-08T10:35:00.000Z	Kliment	mz|`	wx.version() works for me
2012-06-08T10:35:00.000Z	mz|`		but not for your user
2012-06-08T10:35:00.000Z	Kliment		>>> wx.version()
2012-06-08T10:35:00.000Z	Kliment		'2.8.11.0 (gtk2-unicode)'
2012-06-08T10:36:00.000Z	mz|`		seems the upgrade did remove some packages from the system
2012-06-08T10:36:00.000Z	Kliment	mz|`	Any idea which ones?
2012-06-08T10:38:00.000Z	mz|`	Kliment	no, as I have not the upgrade logs ;)
