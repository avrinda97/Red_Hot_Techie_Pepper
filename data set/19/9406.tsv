2006-11-15T08:25:00.000Z	umops		can anyone help me with this, i cant connect to a local SSH server for some reason, "ssh: connect to host x.x.x.x port 22: Connection refused", its a fresh ubuntu install so i dont think it's firewall
2006-11-15T08:26:00.000Z	dooglus	umops	can you connect to it from other hosts?
2006-11-15T08:26:00.000Z	umops	dooglus	if i am on another computer, and cant connect to it
2006-11-15T08:27:00.000Z	dooglus	umops	I'm trying to ask whether it's a problem with the client or the server
2006-11-15T08:27:00.000Z	dooglus	umops	ie. can the client connect to other servers?  or can other clients connect to the server?
2006-11-15T08:27:00.000Z	umops	dooglus	sorry, yes it can
2006-11-15T08:29:00.000Z	umops	dooglus	yes
2006-11-15T08:32:00.000Z	dooglus	umops	does "ps -ef | grep ssh" show anything?
2006-11-15T08:45:00.000Z	umops	dooglus	Netziro:  I am still having problems, i cannot start the daemon with .../sshd start
2006-11-15T08:47:00.000Z	dooglus	umops	what does sshd start tell you?
2006-11-15T08:48:00.000Z	dooglus	umops	it's "sudo /etc/init.d/ssh restart"
2006-11-15T08:49:00.000Z	umops	dooglus	"Priveledge seperation user sshd does not exist"
2006-11-15T08:51:00.000Z	dooglus	umops	the sshd user should be created when you install the package.  try reinstalling it with "sudo apt-get --reinstall install openssh-server"
2006-11-15T08:53:00.000Z	umops	dooglus	thats it! thankyou, i tried sudo apt-get remove ssh.. then reinstlaling and it didnt work, whats the difference?
2006-11-15T08:53:00.000Z	dooglus	umops	'ssh' is an empty package which depends on the separate client and server packages.
2006-11-15T08:53:00.000Z	dooglus	umops	uninstalling 'ssh' won't uninstall 'openssh-server'
2006-11-15T08:53:00.000Z	umops	dooglus	okay thanks again
2006-11-15T08:54:00.000Z	dooglus	umops	if you run "apt-cache show ssh | grep Size" you'll see that the ssh package is tiny
2006-11-15T08:55:00.000Z	umops	dooglus	yes i noticed that when i originally installed, i did it as the ubuntu guide this time :S
