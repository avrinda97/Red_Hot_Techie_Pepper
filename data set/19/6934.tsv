2008-03-15T08:47:00.000Z	nickrud	victorribeiro	system->admin->restricted manger, enable the ati resticted driver. Reboot. run   fglrxinfo , make sure it's using 8.37.6 driver.   install xserver-xgl compizconfig-settings-manager . Log out and back in. system->prefs->appearance, effects tab
2008-03-15T08:48:00.000Z	victorribeiro	nickrud	I've tried that...
2008-03-15T08:49:00.000Z	nickrud	victorribeiro	did you try using the driver from ati site? If you did, true, that won't work easily
2008-03-15T08:50:00.000Z	victorribeiro	nickrud	Yeah man, I ask a guy friend of mine to take a look at it to me, cause he knows more about linux than me, even he couldnt help me
2008-03-15T08:54:00.000Z	nickrud	victorribeiro	  sudo apti-get install --reinstall xorg-driver-fglrx linux-restricted-modules-$(uname  -r) libgl1-mesa-glx libgl1-mesa-dev
2008-03-15T08:54:00.000Z	nickrud	victorribeiro	erm, typon in   the apt-get but otherwise ... and the last line in fgrlxinfo output

2008-03-15T08:55:00.000Z	nickrud	victorribeiro	trying to replace any files that were installed with the ati drivers
2008-03-15T08:55:00.000Z	victorribeiro	nickrud	ill reboot now
2008-03-15T08:59:00.000Z	nickrud	victorribeiro	so, what does fglrxinfo say now?
2008-03-15T09:00:00.000Z	victorribeiro	nickrud	its working, but its slow as hell
2008-03-15T09:00:00.000Z	victorribeiro	nickrud	I just tried that first option that you gave me...
2008-03-15T09:00:00.000Z	nickrud	victorribeiro	that's xserver-xgl. And why I'm not using compiz on my x1100 :)
2008-03-15T09:00:00.000Z	victorribeiro	nickrud	haha
2008-03-15T09:01:00.000Z	victorribeiro	nickrud	cool, thanks anyway
2008-03-15T09:01:00.000Z	nickrud	victorribeiro	at least you're back to a normal install situation. I"m getting a new laptop with nvidia soon
