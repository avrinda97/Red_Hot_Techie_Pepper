2007-10-24T11:05:00.000Z	lexu3		why is the network manager so unstable?
2007-10-24T11:06:00.000Z	ompaul	lexu3	let me guess you are using wireless
2007-10-24T11:06:00.000Z	lexu3	ompaul	yes.....
2007-10-24T11:06:00.000Z	lexu3	ompaul	I am trying to anyhow...
2007-10-24T11:06:00.000Z	ompaul	lexu3	then it is a driver issue for your machine ;-)
2007-10-24T11:06:00.000Z	lexu3	ompaul	but its hopeless
2007-10-24T11:06:00.000Z	ompaul	lexu3	try madwifi
2007-10-24T11:06:00.000Z	lexu3	ompaul	but it was working perfectly with Feisty
2007-10-24T11:07:00.000Z	lexu3	ompaul	then after the upgrade to Gutsy its all wacked
2007-10-24T11:07:00.000Z	ompaul	lexu3	remove it and reinstall it to "reapply" the hooks
2007-10-24T11:07:00.000Z	lexu3	ompaul	I don't understand
2007-10-24T11:07:00.000Z	lexu3	ompaul	remove it?
2007-10-24T11:07:00.000Z	ompaul	lexu3	the driver and reapply it
2007-10-24T11:08:00.000Z	lexu3	ompaul	but I never installed a driver for it..... Ubuntu just installed it auto
2007-10-24T11:08:00.000Z	ompaul	lexu3	tell  the nm to disable the wireless and start again
2007-10-24T11:09:00.000Z	lexu3	ompaul	how do I do that?
2007-10-24T11:10:00.000Z	ompaul	lexu3	open nm and beside the item you want to disable tick the box
2007-10-24T11:11:00.000Z	lexu3	ompaul	nm = network manager?
2007-10-24T11:11:00.000Z	ompaul	lexu3	yeap and now I go to work
