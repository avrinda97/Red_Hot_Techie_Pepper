2012-08-22T20:18:00.000Z	Furry		I can't - not enough free space on my drive to do so
2012-08-22T20:19:00.000Z	TJ-	Furry	One way to protect your existing /home/$USER is to rename it to a username the installer won't be given.
2012-08-22T20:20:00.000Z	Furry		and then rename it back?
2012-08-22T20:21:00.000Z	TJ-	Furry	then later you can boot into recovery (which is root),  "rm -rf /home/$NEWUSER"  and "mv /home/$OLDUSER /home/$NEWUSER"
2012-08-22T20:21:00.000Z	TJ-		Furry then reboot normally and your personal user home will be back
2012-08-22T20:21:00.000Z	Furry		okay
2012-08-22T20:21:00.000Z	Furry		thanks
2012-08-22T20:21:00.000Z	TJ-	Furry	But I'd still strongly recommend you back-up the old home !!FIRST!!
2012-08-22T20:22:00.000Z	TJ-	Furry	Even if it is over the network to an Ubuntu One locker or similar
2012-08-22T20:22:00.000Z	Furry		no space, no ext drives
2012-08-22T20:22:00.000Z	Furry		aside from a 16gb thumb drive
2012-08-22T20:23:00.000Z	TJ-	Furry	how big is the home directory? do "du -sh /home/$USERNAME"
2012-08-22T20:24:00.000Z	Furry		around 90gb, if memoery serves, but i'll run that
2012-08-22T20:26:00.000Z	Furry	TJ-	66gb
2012-08-22T20:27:00.000Z	TJ-	Furry	Ahhh!
2012-08-22T20:28:00.000Z	Furry	TJ-	so, I should use a different username for the installer, and then move the old home dir to the new one?
2012-08-22T20:29:00.000Z	TJ-	Furry	That seems like the best plan, but make TRIPLE sure the installer isn't going to format / anyhow (check its summary VERY carefully before you give the final go-ahead)
2012-08-22T20:29:00.000Z	Furry		okay, thanks
2012-08-22T21:05:00.000Z	Furry	TJ-	still therE?
