2011-02-09T09:42:00.000Z	cbilljones		there are also people who speak hex
2011-02-09T09:43:00.000Z	cbilljones		base 16 is easier than base 2? lol
2011-02-09T09:44:00.000Z	b4sh	cbilljones	yes whats easier to read 101010100011010 or 551A
2011-02-09T09:45:00.000Z	cbilljones	b4sh	true enough
2011-02-09T11:11:00.000Z	b4sh	cbilljones	elevated privs in waht way?
2011-02-09T11:11:00.000Z	cbilljones	b4sh	like after i enter sudo i get sudo priv for a bit, i want to drop that priv
2011-02-09T11:12:00.000Z	b4sh	cbilljones	logout
2011-02-09T11:12:00.000Z	cbilljones	b4sh	ok, no way to do while logged in?
2011-02-09T11:13:00.000Z	b4sh	cbilljones	that shoulkdnt log you out although Im not that familiar with sudo Im more used to su
2011-02-09T11:14:00.000Z	cbilljones	b4sh	o, you mean logout from terminal?
2011-02-09T11:15:00.000Z	b4sh	cbilljones	yes unless that user was the one who opened the shell it should term super user
2011-02-09T11:16:00.000Z	cbilljones	b4sh	its the same user(me) im testing some scripts, and i just want it to prompt me for my pass, but once i do it once, i have sudo rights for 10 mins or something
2011-02-09T11:17:00.000Z	b4sh	cbilljones	logout would work with su but not sure about sudo
2011-02-09T11:17:00.000Z	cbilljones	b4sh	not working with sudo
2011-02-09T11:18:00.000Z	b4sh	cbilljones	theres probably a better way but if you terminate the terminal that will drop privs
2011-02-09T11:19:00.000Z	cbilljones	b4sh	the problem is im launching from the file, so im getting graphical authentication(testing for my bro who is scared of terminal)
2011-02-09T11:20:00.000Z	cbilljones	b4sh	its no big deal, i was just curious
2011-02-09T11:23:00.000Z	b4sh	cbilljones	I could advise on a "linux" way to fix your prob but Ive been kicked a few times as its not the ubuntu way
2011-02-09T11:24:00.000Z	cbilljones	b4sh	you could pm me if you like
