2008-02-26T00:33:00.000Z	danand_	No1	- yes. in an install of ubuntu you should be able to specify which partition it uses for /home. you must esure though that it doesn't try and format that partition! - as always try and back up your data first
2008-02-26T00:34:00.000Z	No1	danand_	gotchya, ty :D yeah, I'm ok with the partition side of things, I just wasnt sure if the /home folders could be reused in other versions of ubuntu
2008-02-26T00:35:00.000Z	danand_	No1	- certain that they can - thats why a lot of users create /home on a seperate partition. not sure of the exact method during install though ... never done it
2008-02-26T00:37:00.000Z	No1	danand_	I just set mine up on a separate partition, it's quite easy even for a newcomer like me :P prob is that I just dont know which ubuntu is the one I want yet and I was affraid I would have to keep redoing my pc over and over again untill I found the right one :P this saves some headache at least. :D
2008-02-26T00:38:00.000Z	danand_	No1	- cool .... now you _know_ your gonna install ubuntu ..... use it for a bit ..... then wonder what xubuntu's like ..... hmmmm... :)
2008-02-26T00:42:00.000Z	danand_	No1	- no. /usr is the place for apps. unfortunately it will contain all kde files etc. If you wanna try out different desktops why bother with a reinstall at all - just install the meta-package. I'm certain you can configure which desktop you wanna use at login through choosing session type at the login (gdm) screen
2008-02-26T00:43:00.000Z	danand_	No1	- what desktop are you running at the mo
2008-02-26T00:45:00.000Z	danand_	No1	- that might be a bit different to just trying different desktops then. Maybe a reinstall preserving /home would be the way to go.
2008-02-26T00:45:00.000Z	No1	danand_	kk, what was your suggestion going to be if you don't mind, I'd like to at least absorb my options :P
2008-02-26T00:50:00.000Z	danand_	No1	- well .... _if_ your running kde and you wanted to try a gnome desktop, i think you can do an sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop. check that with other users here though. ubuntu-desktop is a meta-package that installs all the stuff normally found on a vanilla ubuntu install. check the output of apt-cache pkgnames | grep ubuntu | grep desktop to see what meta-packages are available
2008-02-26T00:52:00.000Z	danand_	No1	- np and good luck
2008-02-26T00:53:00.000Z	danand_	No1	- :)
2008-02-26T01:28:00.000Z	No1	danand_	I'm back this soon :P
2008-02-26T01:28:00.000Z	danand_	No1	- hows it goin?
2008-02-26T01:32:00.000Z	danand_	No1	- was thinking .... if your feeling brave .... in order to try out ubuntu etc - goto a tty (press ctrl-alt-f1) and uninstall your current desktop - ie sudo apt-get --purge remove kubuntu-desktop ... after that do a sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop. not sure i would be brave (or stupid) enough to try that though... course the simplest solution is to use the live cd of each distro you wanna try
2008-02-26T01:38:00.000Z	danand_	No1	- apt-get --purge remove ... will completely wipe whatever packages you supply as arguments off your system ie apt-get --purge remove kubuntu-desktop will erase all packages to do with the kubuntu desktop. apt-get install ubuntu-desktop will then install all packages associated with the ubuntu/gnome desktop. hopefully then you'd be able to reboot into a gnome desktop as if you had installed ubuntu(edubuntu/xubuntu... or whatever) from cd
2008-02-26T01:52:00.000Z	danand_	No1	- real time kernel is supposed to react to interupt requests in near enough real time (ie fast) with a vanilla linux kernel you may have to wait a while for it to respond while its busy doing something else. has to do with the way the scheduler works i think. with a rt kernel the kernel is run on top of a scheduler - ie as a sub process of the scheduler. with vanilla kernel the scheduler is a subprocess of the kernel ie the kernel controls the scheduli
2008-02-26T01:56:00.000Z	danand_	No1	- i've am familiar with vitualbox problems - i have them all the time :D
2008-02-26T01:57:00.000Z	danand_	No1	- i am*
