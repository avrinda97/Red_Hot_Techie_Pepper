2009-02-27T00:18:00.000Z	khirr		but i want to do a script in bash, how could i do to request the password and log in how superuser?
2009-02-27T00:19:00.000Z	ardchoille	khirr	you don't log into the root account, use sudo or gksudo
2009-02-27T00:19:00.000Z	khirr		<ardchoille> thanks, i will try
2009-02-27T00:20:00.000Z	ardchoille	khirr	also you need to make sure you know what the script is suppoed to do before running it with admin privs
2009-02-27T00:21:00.000Z	khirr		<ardchoille> yes, is for mount a unit
2009-02-27T00:21:00.000Z	ardchoille	khirr	ok, for a script in bash, you would do: sudo scriptname
2009-02-27T00:22:00.000Z	khirr	ardchoille	yes
2009-02-27T00:26:00.000Z	khirr		<ardchoille>for use installer in gtk? in bash is apt-get but i will use gksudo, and what is the comand for install in grafic mode?
2009-02-27T00:27:00.000Z	ardchoille	khirr	the easiest way to install a package in graphic mode is to use synaptic
2009-02-27T00:27:00.000Z	ardchoille	khirr	However, use sudo for bash and use gksudo for gui apps needed admin privs
2009-02-27T00:28:00.000Z	khirr		<ardchoille> mean, for the command un my scrip
2009-02-27T00:28:00.000Z	ardchoille	khirr	if you're calling a gui app you need to use gksudo
2009-02-27T00:29:00.000Z	khirr		<ardchoille> gksudo "synaptic install smbfs", is it correct?
2009-02-27T00:29:00.000Z	ardchoille	khirr	oh, no, use:  sudo apt-get install smbfs
2009-02-27T00:30:00.000Z	khirr		<ardchoille> but i'd like install in GUI mode, is there a way? i have seen script that use that
2009-02-27T00:30:00.000Z	ardchoille	khirr	synaptic is a graphical package manager, the command equivalents are apt-get or aptitude
2009-02-27T00:30:00.000Z	khirr		<ardchoille> yes, i want in grafical mode
2009-02-27T00:30:00.000Z	ardchoille	khirr	I don't know of a way to do that
