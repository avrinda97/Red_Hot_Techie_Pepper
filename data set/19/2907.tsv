2011-02-13T08:04:00.000Z	truepurple		When I go to download ubuntu 10.10 64bit, it has "amd" right before "64" Why?  Is it saying that its only for AMD CPU's or something?
2011-02-13T08:05:00.000Z	rww	truepurple	amd64 will work fine on Intel x86_64/EMT64/Intel64 processors
2011-03-28T07:18:00.000Z	rww	truepurple	xchat does. irssi highlights the nickname part of the message in yellow by default (though I have it set to highlight with a red background personally), pidgin does something that I forget.
2011-07-26T10:10:00.000Z	rww	truepurple	no and no
2011-07-26T10:16:00.000Z	rww	truepurple	no
2011-07-26T10:17:00.000Z	truepurple	rww	from what experience/knowledge base do you speak from?  I asked you this in PM, but you never answered
2011-07-26T10:18:00.000Z	rww	truepurple	I don't do support in PM or accept PMs from random people.
2011-07-26T10:19:00.000Z	truepurple	rww	Ok, then please answer here then
2011-07-26T10:19:00.000Z	truepurple	rww	from what experience/knowledge base do you speak from?
2011-07-26T10:20:00.000Z	rww	truepurple	Standard computer usage is not sensitive enough to hard disk seek times that the small difference in seek times based on disk area matter.
2011-07-26T10:21:00.000Z	rww	truepurple	In fact, the time you've spent asking this question here and elsewhere is probably larger than the total amount of time you would save from putting Linux at the end of your disk from now until your computer dies.
2011-07-26T10:22:00.000Z	truepurple	rww	Ok, but what is your level of expertise so that I may properly weigh the information you are giving me. One can get many very different and opposing answers online.
2011-07-26T10:23:00.000Z	rww	truepurple	If my information were incorrect, the other channel members would be disgreeing with me.
2011-07-26T10:23:00.000Z	truepurple	rww	Or they could be remaining silent for not knowing
2011-07-26T10:24:00.000Z	rww	truepurple	You're continuing to waste time. If you're interested in optimizing your life, I suggest bringing this conversation to a close :)
2011-07-26T10:27:00.000Z	rww	truepurple	/msg chanserv access #ubuntu list
2011-07-26T10:28:00.000Z	truepurple	rww	"/msg chanserv access #ubuntu list" does not work for me.
2011-07-26T10:29:00.000Z	rww	truepurple	fix your IRC client, then
2011-07-26T10:29:00.000Z	rww	truepurple	in the highly likely case that you're using xchat, it has questionable tastes in placement of NOTICES. Consider /query Chanserv first.
