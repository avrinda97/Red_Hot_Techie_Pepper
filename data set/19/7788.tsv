2007-08-08T06:42:00.000Z	bjwebb	Meat-Lovers	is it the live CD?
2007-08-08T06:42:00.000Z	bjwebb	Meat-Lovers	how much RAM have you got?
2007-08-08T06:42:00.000Z	Meat-Lovers		256mb
2007-08-08T06:42:00.000Z	bjwebb		that'll be why its slow
2007-08-08T06:43:00.000Z	Meat-Lovers	Jack_Sparrow	i did the CD defect test
2007-08-08T06:43:00.000Z	bjwebb	Meat-Lovers	its probably just ur RAM
2007-08-08T06:43:00.000Z	Meat-Lovers		whats the minimum spec to run ubuntu ?
2007-08-08T06:44:00.000Z	Meat-Lovers		i'm planning to install on p3 800mhz with 128 ram
2007-08-08T06:44:00.000Z	bjwebb	Meat-Lovers	its will run on 128MB
2007-08-08T06:44:00.000Z	Meat-Lovers		Jack_Sparrow:yes i'm on onboard
2007-08-08T06:44:00.000Z	bjwebb	Meat-Lovers	128MB isn't too speedy; something with fluxbox might be better
