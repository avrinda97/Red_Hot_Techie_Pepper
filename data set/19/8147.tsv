2007-05-30T12:07:00.000Z	big_boy		i need help with the following "E subprocess  script returned error exit status 2 linux image 2.6 20 16 generic"
2007-05-30T12:07:00.000Z	Gnea	big_boy	could you paste the entire error to pastebin?
2007-05-30T12:14:00.000Z	Gnea	big_boy	why can't you use pastebin?
2007-05-30T12:14:00.000Z	Gnea	big_boy	i'm willing to help, just need every line from when you type until it ends
2007-05-30T12:21:00.000Z	Gnea	big_boy	sec, i'm finally reading it (i get distracted easy sometimes)
2007-05-30T12:22:00.000Z	Gnea	big_boy	okay, are there any other 2.6.20 image packages? apt-cache search linux-image 2.6.20
2007-05-30T12:22:00.000Z	Gnea	big_boy	and what CPU do you use?
2007-05-30T12:22:00.000Z	Gnea	big_boy	cat /proc/cpuinfo
2007-05-30T12:24:00.000Z	Gnea	big_boy	gonna need a URL
2007-05-30T12:24:00.000Z	Gnea	big_boy	oh, it's a laptop. who makes it and what's the model?
2007-05-30T12:26:00.000Z	Gnea	big_boy	okay, if you type this: apt-cache search linux image 2.6.20   do you get any results that contain 686, i686 or p4?
2007-05-30T12:28:00.000Z	Gnea	big_boy	basically what you want to do is to find a kernel that is best suited for your CPU so that it will run more efficiently and thus faster
2007-05-30T12:28:00.000Z	Gnea	big_boy	i'm guessing that's why you want to upgrade your kernel :)
2007-05-30T12:29:00.000Z	Gnea	big_boy	alright, go for the x86 one then, if you install it, dpkg should then 'forget' about the generic one
2007-05-30T12:31:00.000Z	Gnea	big_boy	cat /proc/version  <-- what does that return?
2007-05-30T12:34:00.000Z	Gnea	big_boy	yeah, i'd try installing linux-image-2.6.20-16-386 and see if it produces the same error
2007-05-30T12:35:00.000Z	Gnea	big_boy	apt-get install linux-image-2.6.20-16-386
2007-05-30T12:50:00.000Z	Gnea	big_boy	sorry about that, you can actually pin a package so that it won't use something else
2007-05-30T12:54:00.000Z	Gnea	big_boy	good luck with that
