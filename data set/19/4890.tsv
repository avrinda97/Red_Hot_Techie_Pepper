2008-10-16T20:17:00.000Z	rich5		Anybody intelligible regarding installing ubuntu server edition + fluxbox?
2008-10-16T20:17:00.000Z	ikonia	rich5	please just ask the question
2008-10-16T20:20:00.000Z	ikonia	rich5	if you want a desktop what made you chose the server OS ?
2008-10-16T20:21:00.000Z	rich5	ikonia	--fluxbox doesnt work with ubuntu desktop
2008-10-16T20:21:00.000Z	ikonia	rich5	it doesn't come with the ubutnu server
2008-10-16T20:21:00.000Z	ikonia	rich5	fluxbuntu
2008-10-16T20:21:00.000Z	ikonia	rich5	fluxbox does work with the desktop install
2008-10-16T20:23:00.000Z	rich5	ikonia	I'd rather emerge or apt get it if it doesnt come with it.. fuxbuntu wouldn't include the commandline installation environment, which I'm prepared to take on
2008-10-16T20:24:00.000Z	ikonia	rich5	every OS includes the command line version
2008-10-16T20:24:00.000Z	ikonia	rich5	the server install is not aimed at home user hardware - so may cause you problems your not expecting
2008-10-16T20:24:00.000Z	ikonia	rich5	my advice to you would be to install either ubuntu and install the fluxbox desktop package, or install fluxbuntu
2008-10-16T20:25:00.000Z	rich5	ikonia	yep.. but I'm trying to get something optimized for the hardware of my EEE, though I am not finding guides which work to accomplish such.
2008-10-16T20:26:00.000Z	rich5	ikonia	I'd like to adjust a kernel to be compatible--or copy the kernel from a ubuntu live cd from my EEE. are you aware of any guides, or howto do so?
2008-10-16T20:26:00.000Z	ikonia	rich5	thats not practical
2008-10-16T20:28:00.000Z	rich5	ikonia	I mainly want to do so because when i do a regular install, wireless and ethernet isnt defaulted compatible in the kernel
2008-10-16T20:28:00.000Z	ikonia	rich5	because your using the server kernel
2008-10-16T20:28:00.000Z	ikonia	rich5	use the desktop environment
2008-10-16T20:28:00.000Z	rich5	ikonia	not to mention it'd be nice to get the webcam and other features of the touchpad to work as well.
2008-10-16T20:28:00.000Z	ikonia	rich5	use teh desktop version
