2008-07-21T11:40:00.000Z	goose		does anyone know why ubuntu will detect wireless networks, but not connect to them?
2008-07-21T11:42:00.000Z	goose		damn.. it originally worked straight off the install, but when I installed wifi-radar, it stopped working
2008-07-21T11:42:00.000Z	wbmj	goose	to use wifi-radar you need to edit /etc/interfaces
2008-07-21T11:43:00.000Z	goose	wbmj	I tried removing wifi-radar and it still wouldn't connect after I got rid of it
2008-07-21T11:43:00.000Z	goose	wbmj	detects fine and dandy, just doesn't connect
2008-07-21T11:45:00.000Z	wbmj	goose	Do the connections have an icon next them
2008-07-21T11:46:00.000Z	goose	wbmj	not following you. what do you mean?
2008-07-21T11:47:00.000Z	wbmj	goose	left click on the nm-applet... the dropdown menu should list available connections
2008-07-21T11:47:00.000Z	goose	wbmj	it only says "Manual configuration"
2008-07-21T11:49:00.000Z	wbmj	goose	open System > Administration > Network and set your wireless connection to roaming
2008-07-21T11:50:00.000Z	goose	wbmj	ok, done. How can I check to see if I have an IP assigned to my wireless?
2008-07-21T11:50:00.000Z	wbmj	goose	now go to the nm-applet and see if you have a list of access points
2008-07-21T11:51:00.000Z	goose	wbmj	yes, I do. Only one, the network I'm hard wired into right now and trying to connect to wirelessly.
2008-07-21T11:51:00.000Z	wbmj	goose	laptop?
2008-07-21T11:52:00.000Z	goose	wbmj	yep. I'm 30% done downloading a 700 mb file, so I'm a bit hesitant to unplug the ethernet and test it
2008-07-21T11:52:00.000Z	goose	wbmj	is there a terminal command I can execute to see if I have an IP assigned to my wireless?
2008-07-21T11:53:00.000Z	wbmj	goose	ok when you finish download disconnect the hardwire and logout/in........should update nm-applet listings
2008-07-21T12:02:00.000Z	goose	wbmj	you rock
2008-07-21T12:03:00.000Z	wbmj	goose	np
