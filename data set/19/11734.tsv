2005-11-29T13:36:00.000Z	HappyFool		!tell mjk64 about install
2005-11-29T13:37:00.000Z	mjk64	HappyFool	Thanks!
2005-11-29T13:38:00.000Z	mjk64	HappyFool	Now where the fsck can one find the installation manual from the many web pages? It's a mystery to me %-)
2005-11-29T13:38:00.000Z	HappyFool	mjk64	that's a bit of a catch-all page, i believe
2005-11-29T13:40:00.000Z	mjk64	HappyFool	Yes, seems so ... I had no problem finding the installation manual for Debian and thought it would be as easy with Ubuntu ...
2005-11-29T13:40:00.000Z	HappyFool	mjk64	how's Installation/386 look to you?
2005-11-29T13:40:00.000Z	HappyFool	mjk64	oh, that manual
2005-11-29T13:40:00.000Z	mjk64	HappyFool	Checking it ...
2005-11-29T13:41:00.000Z	mjk64	HappyFool	Oh ... the manual is ... err ... well ... a *little* short. :-}
2005-11-29T13:43:00.000Z	HappyFool	mjk64	at a guess, your guess is correct
2005-11-29T13:43:00.000Z	HappyFool	mjk64	you can always add users later
2005-11-29T13:44:00.000Z	mjk64	HappyFool	Oh, I love guessing %-) (After all, I chose "expert", so I'm expected to know what a multiseat system is :-}
2005-11-29T13:44:00.000Z	HappyFool	mjk64	ah ;)
2005-11-29T13:46:00.000Z	mjk64	HappyFool	Googling for this sentence revealed package description for multiseat-udeb, which says: "This udeb does base configuration for a multiseat (multiple simultaneous users) system."
2005-11-29T13:46:00.000Z	HappyFool	mjk64	hmm
2005-11-29T13:46:00.000Z	HappyFool	mjk64	some sort of thin-client thing
2005-11-29T13:47:00.000Z	mjk64	HappyFool	Sheesh, 246 Google hits for "multiseat system" vs. 58,300 hits for "multiuser system". I guess "multiseat" is African. %-)
2005-11-29T13:47:00.000Z	HappyFool	mjk64	err, that was supposed to be a question
