2006-09-18T10:24:00.000Z	Steil		 i just ate a bacon and cheese sandwich (bacon cooked with cheese then the grease drizzled on the bread to "toast" it.)
2006-09-18T10:24:00.000Z	Steil		 and it was still cold when I bit into it
2006-09-18T10:24:00.000Z	Steil		yes
2006-09-18T10:24:00.000Z	Steil		bacon from a pig
2006-09-18T10:24:00.000Z	Steil		undercooked underrated
2006-09-18T10:25:00.000Z	Steil		very tasty, i support bacon anyday
2006-09-18T10:25:00.000Z	Steil		I don't love bacon
2006-09-18T10:25:00.000Z	Steil		it gives me worms
2006-09-18T10:25:00.000Z	Steil		but the worms let me stay the same weight

2007-03-09T16:56:00.000Z	Steil	holycow	i want the music played on the box
2007-03-09T16:58:00.000Z	Steil	holycow	i didn't want xforwarding, meaning i wanted an interface that would run over http or something of the sort
2007-03-09T16:59:00.000Z	holycow	Steil	well which part of my question didn't you understand?
2007-03-09T16:59:00.000Z	holycow	Steil	if you want http based interface, AS I ALREADY TOLD YOU, install apache, then install a flash player.  there are billions on the net
2007-03-09T17:00:00.000Z	holycow	Steil	if your going to dicker about http vs. some other protocol, i'm not sure i care to have thet discussion
2007-03-10T17:04:00.000Z	holycow	Steil	not at all, its just me
2007-03-10T17:04:00.000Z	holycow	Steil	glad you found something that fits your need
