2008-09-22T07:26:00.000Z	aftersomehelp		I wonder if anyone might be able to help with a problem I'm having installing ubuntu as a dual boot thing?
2008-09-22T07:27:00.000Z	aftersomehelp		I ran the Live CD, and used the partitioner to create an Ubuntu partition, but it can't seem to boot up with it?
2008-09-22T07:29:00.000Z	aftersomehelp		I think I may need to make sure the GRUB loader is working ok?
2008-09-22T07:29:00.000Z	aftersomehelp		but I"m not sure how :-)
2008-09-22T07:30:00.000Z	aftersomehelp		is there an easy way to see if the GRUB loader is working? (I've installed Ubuntu on a new partition, but only XP starts up..)
2008-09-22T07:30:00.000Z	dashnu	aftersomehelp	grubs not working
2008-09-22T07:31:00.000Z	aftersomehelp	dashnu	- well when I restarted having installed Ubuntu, it simply loads XP - but shows the smaller partition size..
2008-09-22T07:32:00.000Z	dashnu	aftersomehelp	how many disks you have? what disk did you install it on?
2008-09-22T07:32:00.000Z	aftersomehelp		I've got three hard drives in.....
2008-09-22T07:33:00.000Z	aftersomehelp		joe - thus far it simply offers to re-install Ubuntu....
2008-09-22T07:33:00.000Z	dashnu	aftersomehelp	joe is right i think boot back into ubuntu install grub on your mbr first disk
2008-09-22T07:34:00.000Z	aftersomehelp		cartooncat - sounds right!
2008-09-22T07:34:00.000Z	aftersomehelp		p'raps I need some partition advice then - 'cos I can simply re-do it then....
2008-09-22T07:34:00.000Z	dashnu	aftersomehelp	boot the live disk up
2008-09-22T07:35:00.000Z	aftersomehelp		I'm in ubuntu now :-)
2008-09-22T07:35:00.000Z	aftersomehelp		(so yup - have done so.....)
2008-09-22T07:35:00.000Z	dashnu		mount drive chroot into the install
2008-09-22T07:35:00.000Z	dashnu		install grub
2008-09-22T07:35:00.000Z	dashnu	aftersomehelp	or you have to reinstall..
