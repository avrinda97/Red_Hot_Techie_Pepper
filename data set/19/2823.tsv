2009-12-25T01:52:00.000Z	trism	Sofia	it said the same thing when I clean installed 9.10, even though it has both 9.04 and XP on there, but it detected XP fine after I selected the partitions manually
2009-12-25T01:52:00.000Z	Sofia	trism	good, ty
2009-12-25T01:53:00.000Z	Sofia	trism	can you please help me configure the partitions?
2009-12-25T01:54:00.000Z	trism	Sofia	you said you already had 8.10 on there right? can't you just select the root and swap partitions from that? (and /home if you have it)
2009-12-25T01:54:00.000Z	Sofia	trism	no, i formatted the 810 partition.
2009-12-25T01:55:00.000Z	trism	Sofia	it should still be there though unless you deleted it...
2009-12-25T01:56:00.000Z	Sofia	trism	yes, the partition is there. So, I right click on it, select change and use as what?
2009-12-25T01:56:00.000Z	Sofia	trism	"ext3 journaling file system"?
2009-12-25T01:57:00.000Z	trism	Sofia	up to you, you may want to use ext4 (it is a bit quicker when it has to fsck)
2009-12-25T01:57:00.000Z	Sofia	trism	ok, and mount point? "/"?
2009-12-25T01:58:00.000Z	trism	Sofia	yep
2009-12-25T01:58:00.000Z	trism	Sofia	assuming that was your old root partition from 8.10
2009-12-25T01:59:00.000Z	Sofia	trism	ok, anything else I should change here? I keep the old swap and that's all?
2009-12-25T01:59:00.000Z	trism	Sofia	that should be it
2009-12-25T02:01:00.000Z	Sofia	trism	and next screen I have to select username and pass. Will this be the root pass?
2009-12-25T02:02:00.000Z	trism	Sofia	ubuntu doesn't use root passwords, that will be your main user, and you do everything you need to as root with sudo and your password
2009-12-25T02:03:00.000Z	Sofia	trism	ok, it detected my xp user accounts. I guess it's going to work as dual boot
2009-12-25T02:03:00.000Z	trism	Sofia	yep you should be good
2009-12-25T02:06:00.000Z	Sofia	trism	ty
