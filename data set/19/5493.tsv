2008-06-22T18:24:00.000Z	arvernes		hello, a question about user and group. As user, my id is let's say "me', and I belong to group "me". I would like me to belong, not to the "me" group, but to the "users" group? Is it possible ? Do you if it could break something ? Thanks.
2008-06-22T18:24:00.000Z	gordonjcp	arvernes	yes
2008-06-22T18:25:00.000Z	gordonjcp	arvernes	use "usermod -G -a <name of group>" but read the man page for usermod first ;-)
2008-06-22T18:25:00.000Z	gordonjcp	arvernes	in short, you can be in many groups at once
2008-06-22T18:25:00.000Z	arvernes	gordonjcp	wols : is it useful to belong to more than one group ?
2008-06-22T18:27:00.000Z	arvernes	gordonjcp	?
2008-06-22T18:28:00.000Z	gordonjcp	arvernes	yeah, definitely
2008-06-22T18:29:00.000Z	arvernes	gordonjcp	ok, I'm gonna subscribe "me" to the "users" group first. You told me to read the usermod man pages, I saw there is a GUI for that. I suppose it is secure enuf ?
2008-06-22T18:30:00.000Z	gordonjcp	arvernes	just that there are some implications to using usermod -G
2008-06-22T18:30:00.000Z	gordonjcp	arvernes	-a adds a group, leaving out -a replaces the groups with the list you give it
2008-06-22T18:30:00.000Z	gordonjcp	arvernes	if you're not careful you can take yourself out of the admin group
2008-06-22T18:33:00.000Z	arvernes	gordonjcp	sorry but I want to be sure ;-) - If i run "usermod -G -a users me" - it should be ok (me: is my login".
2008-06-22T18:35:00.000Z	arvernes	gordonjcp	hmmm, it should be "usermod -G users -a me" ??
2008-06-22T18:38:00.000Z	gordonjcp	arvernes	should be "usermod -G -a users <username>"
2008-06-22T18:38:00.000Z	gordonjcp	arvernes	where <username> is whatever your real username is
2008-06-22T18:40:00.000Z	arvernes	gordonjcp	according to the man page, "login", seems to be the login, not the real username ? an error on my side ?
2008-06-22T18:40:00.000Z	gordonjcp	arvernes	well, whever the username is
2008-06-22T18:48:00.000Z	arvernes	gordonjcp	the right command is : "usermod -G users -a me" - "usermod -G -a me" gave me an error
2008-06-22T18:55:00.000Z	arvernes	gordonjcp	need more help if possible. Now I ran that command line, everything, seems ok, I need to assign ID 501 instead of 1000 to user "me". I suppose I ahve to do two things: 1) to specify that group "users", is the main group to user "me", then run usermod as : "usermod -u 501 me"   -   then : "find / -user 1000 -exec chown me {} \;" - is it correct ?
