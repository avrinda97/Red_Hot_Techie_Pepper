2012-11-20T07:38:00.000Z	Butcho		anyone know of a fix for stuff like this? http://askubuntu.com/questions/216780/garbled-text-in-terminal-titles-and-other-places-after-upgrade-to-12-10
2012-11-20T07:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Butcho	is it an upgrade to Quantal from Preicse?
2012-11-20T07:40:00.000Z	Butcho	ActionParsnip	no, new install
2012-11-20T07:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Butcho	if you run:  nvidia-settings   what driver are you using?
2012-11-20T07:41:00.000Z	Butcho	ActionParsnip	Nouveau
2012-11-20T07:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Butcho	then run:   sudo apt-get install nvidia-current    then reboot. Your Intel CPU doesn't have an inbuilt CPU which makes a tonne of issues not happen
2012-11-20T07:43:00.000Z	Butcho	ActionParsnip	ok rebooting, brb
2012-11-20T07:59:00.000Z	Butcho	ActionParsnip	when I select any of the other nvidia drivers. My resolution is set to 1280x800, the display says laptop, I can't change it and everything is offscreen. The only thing I can do is rightclick the desktop
2012-11-20T08:27:00.000Z	Butcho	ActionParsnip	you around?
2012-11-20T08:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Butcho	aye
2012-11-20T08:30:00.000Z	Butcho	ActionParsnip	tried all the various nvidia drivers. Can't get a working display. my monitor is detected as laptop, everythings huge at 1280x800 resolution, and everything off screen so I can't run anything.
2012-11-20T08:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Butcho	have you tried tweaking in nvidia-settings
2012-11-20T08:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Butcho	sounds liek a cheap screen, not reporting EDID
2012-11-20T08:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Butcho	try:  sudo nvidia-xconfig    then reboot
2012-11-20T08:31:00.000Z	Butcho	ActionParsnip	it's a apple cinema display 30"... anything but cheap :)
2012-11-20T08:32:00.000Z	Butcho	ActionParsnip	actually I did... made it worse at 800x600 resolution
2012-11-20T08:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Butcho	cool, then use:   gksudo nvidia-settings    and set the res to something and click 'save to X server config'   you can then run:   gksudo /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2012-11-20T08:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Butcho	you can then edit the xorg.conf file manually and setup the screen. Good screens do this all for you.
2012-11-20T08:36:00.000Z	Butcho	ActionParsnip	I'll give it a shot. Hard to do all this at exploded resolutions when everythings off screen
