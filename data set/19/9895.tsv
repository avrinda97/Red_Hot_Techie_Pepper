2006-08-31T14:57:00.000Z	kuribas		Was I wrong to think that ubuntu has good hardware support?
2006-08-31T14:57:00.000Z	sethk	kuribas	no, although the issue is linux support, not ubuntu support
2006-08-31T14:57:00.000Z	sethk	kuribas	if you mean that everything supported under windows is also supported under linux then, yes, you were wrong
2006-08-31T14:58:00.000Z	kuribas	sethk	lol, I have been using linux for 8 years.
2006-08-31T14:58:00.000Z	sethk	kuribas	then you should know that the primary issue for hardware support is the kernel, not the distro
2006-08-31T14:59:00.000Z	sethk	kuribas	if you have debian working, why are you trying to use a different distro?
2006-08-31T14:59:00.000Z	kuribas	sethk	I broke really badly, and I wanted to try out something else.
2006-08-31T14:59:00.000Z	sethk	kuribas	you can certainly use debian to discover the configuration and then set ubuntu up the same way.  what hardware are we talking about, anyway?
2006-08-31T15:00:00.000Z	kuribas	sethk	My video card is an intel i810
2006-08-31T15:00:00.000Z	sethk	kuribas	that's problem just a kernel config, or even possibly just a kernel module loading, issue
2006-08-31T15:01:00.000Z	sethk	kuribas	you are using dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg, and it isn't finding your hardware?
2006-08-31T15:01:00.000Z	kuribas	sethk	No, I have an xsession with windowmaker running.
2006-08-31T15:01:00.000Z	sethk	kuribas	most likely you can do a text mode install, then configure x with that command, and it will work fine
2006-08-31T15:02:00.000Z	sethk	kuribas	that's really odd, it's the same xorg.  depending on which debian, it is possibly a newer xorg version
2006-08-31T15:02:00.000Z	kuribas	sethk	Maybe the problem is in the new version of xorg.
2006-08-31T15:03:00.000Z	kuribas	sethk	Or a bug in windowsmaker that didn't show up in the previous version of xorg.
2006-08-31T15:03:00.000Z	sethk	kuribas	it's possible, sure, but i810 is common enough that a serious bug would very likely be known and fixed
2006-08-31T15:03:00.000Z	sethk	kuribas	possibly configuration.  make sure it isn't trying to use frame buffer
2006-08-31T15:04:00.000Z	kuribas	sethk	That could be it, I'll check it out.
