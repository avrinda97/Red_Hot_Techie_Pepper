2005-06-08T13:27:00.000Z	SigNagE		could someone be so kind as to tell me the main advantages and difadvantages of Ubuntu :)
2005-06-08T13:27:00.000Z	thoreauputic	SigNagE	it works
2005-06-08T13:28:00.000Z	thoreauputic	SigNagE	disadvantages: you need to set up multimedia
2005-06-08T13:29:00.000Z	thoreauputic	SigNagE	see ubotu's UEL
2005-06-08T13:29:00.000Z	thoreauputic	SigNagE	sorry I meant url - follow the link
2005-06-08T13:31:00.000Z	thoreauputic	SigNagE	it has a 6 month release cycle
2005-06-08T13:32:00.000Z	thoreauputic	SigNagE	during the 6 months, you get security updates and major bug fixes
2005-06-08T13:32:00.000Z	thoreauputic	SigNagE	each release is supported for 18 months
2005-06-08T13:33:00.000Z	thoreauputic	SigNagE	gimp is installed by default
2005-06-08T13:34:00.000Z	thoreauputic	SigNagE	as is firefox
2005-06-08T13:34:00.000Z	thoreauputic	SigNagE	definitely
2005-06-08T13:34:00.000Z	thoreauputic	SigNagE	heh - we're a bit biased here :)
2005-06-08T13:35:00.000Z	thoreauputic	SigNagE	the community is great
2005-06-08T13:35:00.000Z	thoreauputic	SigNagE	I think the main disadvantage is probably multimedia support - but the fixes are fairly easy
2005-06-08T13:36:00.000Z	thoreauputic	SigNagE	the url I gave you from the bot tells you how
2005-06-17T16:37:00.000Z	thoreauputic	SigNagE	umm... that's a pretty general question
2005-06-17T16:39:00.000Z	thoreauputic	SigNagE	for commands etc a good place to start is http://tuxfiles.org
