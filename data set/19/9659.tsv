2006-10-06T14:02:00.000Z	TimothyP		so once again I'm looking for a jre2 repository
2006-10-06T14:03:00.000Z	TimothyP		I have no idea :s
2006-10-06T14:03:00.000Z	TimothyP		don't even know what easyubuntu has
2006-10-06T14:03:00.000Z	TimothyP		all I want is to install sun-java
2006-10-06T14:03:00.000Z	TimothyP		www.ubuntuguide.org says how, but it doesn't say what repository
2006-10-06T14:04:00.000Z	TimothyP		and I don't think java is illegal :s
2006-10-06T14:04:00.000Z	TimothyP		I have the mulvivers :s
2006-10-06T14:04:00.000Z	TimothyP		but it says it's not in there....
2006-10-06T14:04:00.000Z	TimothyP		been trough all the guids
2006-10-06T14:05:00.000Z	TimothyP		the packages are missing from the multivers
2006-10-06T14:05:00.000Z	b03nto	TimothyP	why not d/w java from java.sun.com and build the deb ur self
2006-10-06T14:14:00.000Z	b03nto	TimothyP	u can get jre-1_5_0_09-linux-i586.bin  from here http://slackware.mirrors.tds.net/pub/slackware/slackware_source/l/jre/
2006-10-06T14:14:00.000Z	TimothyP	b03nto	 THANK YOU :)
2006-10-06T14:16:00.000Z	TimothyP	b03nto	I know but that doesn't work either since I need the java-package package for that and that's nowhere to be found either
2006-10-06T14:16:00.000Z	b03nto	TimothyP	: d/w the bin, after that u can make deb from it, with make-jpkg
2006-10-06T14:17:00.000Z	TimothyP	b03nto	I cannot find the make-jpkg package
2006-10-06T14:17:00.000Z	b03nto	TimothyP	sudo apt-get install java-package java-common, its in there
2006-10-06T14:19:00.000Z	b03nto	TimothyP	oops sorry i didnt see that
2006-10-06T14:22:00.000Z	b03nto	TimothyP	i get java-package from this repo deb ftp://kambing.vlsm.org/ubuntu dapper main restricted universe multiverse
