2006-08-11T11:34:00.000Z	damo22		Icemasta: how
2006-08-11T11:34:00.000Z	damo22		nope
2006-08-11T11:34:00.000Z	damo22		Icemasta: what is your cpu
2006-08-11T11:36:00.000Z	damo22		pentium 4? you should get dual core or something
2006-08-11T11:37:00.000Z	damo22		Icemasta: heh my hdd died, i had to buy one
2006-08-11T11:37:00.000Z	damo22		80gb
2006-08-11T11:38:00.000Z	damo22		icemasta: geez...
2006-08-11T11:39:00.000Z	damo22		Icemasta: i really think hdds are stupidly designed, not to be servicible
2006-08-11T11:39:00.000Z	damo22		Icemasta: the mechanics inside a hdd should be replacable
2006-08-11T11:40:00.000Z	damo22		yep
2006-08-11T11:40:00.000Z	longwave	damo22	how would the average user replace them, seeing as the HD is so fragile it has to be built in a clean room environment?
2006-08-11T11:41:00.000Z	damo22	longwave	creates jobs for technicians
2006-08-11T11:41:00.000Z	longwave	damo22	but it is cheaper just to buy a new HD than pay a technician to fix a broken one
2006-08-11T11:41:00.000Z	damo22	longwave	yes, and as a result we have landfill full of devices which could be fixed
2006-08-11T11:41:00.000Z	damo22		:(
2006-08-11T11:42:00.000Z	longwave	damo22	yes, i agree with the landfill problem, but there is no easy solution that is also cheap :(
2006-08-11T11:43:00.000Z	damo22	longwave	wrong, i believe it is practical to design a modular hdd which can have the mechanical part replacable
2006-08-11T11:43:00.000Z	longwave	damo22	by all means go ahead and build it, but i dont think it is
2006-08-11T11:43:00.000Z	longwave	damo22	even an entire pc is considered throwaway now when it breaks, people would rather buy a new dell than pay to get their old pc fixed
