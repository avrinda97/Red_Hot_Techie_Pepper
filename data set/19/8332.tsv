2007-05-02T05:19:00.000Z	ubuntu_user07		how can i stop the two partitions form my master HD from always mounting?
2007-05-02T05:21:00.000Z	nuu	ubuntu_user07	you can modify /etc/fstab from root, and add the ",noauto" option to the lines concerning the partitions you don't want to automount at startup
2007-05-02T05:25:00.000Z	nuu	ubuntu_user07	as i said, paste me a sample fstab line from your fstab, and i'll show you how to modify it
2007-05-02T05:26:00.000Z	ubuntu_user07	nuu	i sen tyou the lines for my hd
2007-05-02T05:28:00.000Z	nuu	ubuntu_user07	see that "gid=46" ? that has to become "gid=46,noauto"
2007-05-02T05:30:00.000Z	ubuntu_user07	nuu	does this look right
2007-05-02T05:30:00.000Z	nuu	ubuntu_user07	yes
2007-05-02T05:36:00.000Z	ubuntu_user07	nuu	how come i cannot un mount my partitions from hda1?
2007-05-02T05:37:00.000Z	nuu	ubuntu_user07	try sudo umount instead of simply umount
2007-05-02T05:37:00.000Z	nuu	ubuntu_user07	ie do it from root
2007-05-02T05:38:00.000Z	nuu	ubuntu_user07	sudo umount <mountpoint>
2007-05-02T05:38:00.000Z	ubuntu_user07	nuu	so sudo unmount /hda1
2007-05-02T05:38:00.000Z	nuu	ubuntu_user07	/dev/hda1, or /media/hda1, maybe ;)
2007-05-02T05:39:00.000Z	nuu	ubuntu_user07	almost certainly not /hda1 ;)
2007-05-02T05:41:00.000Z	nuu	ubuntu_user07	i don't remember your fstab, but if i recall correctly, it classified them by uuid, not device - that means mount /dev/hda1 wont do you no good
2007-05-02T05:41:00.000Z	nuu	ubuntu_user07	safest bet is to mount by mountpoint, which will always be recognized. ie sudo mount /media/hda1, or whatever the mountpoint is
2007-05-02T05:42:00.000Z	nuu	ubuntu_user07	no, you can't
2007-05-02T05:43:00.000Z	nuu	ubuntu_user07	it'll just tell you that it can't find any /dev/hda1 in fstab/mtab
2007-05-02T05:43:00.000Z	nuu	ubuntu_user07	(that is, if your fstab lists devices by UUID, and not by /dev/xyz)
