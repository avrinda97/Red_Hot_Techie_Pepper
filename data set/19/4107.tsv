2011-11-02T03:55:00.000Z	jamescarr		I've been googling... where's that apt sources.list for ubuntu 9?
2011-11-02T03:55:00.000Z	jamescarr		I have an old desktop and I have too much on my plate to update until next week
2011-11-02T03:55:00.000Z	iceroot	jamescarr	/etc/apt/sources.list
2011-11-02T03:55:00.000Z	iceroot	jamescarr	9.x is no longer supported
2011-11-02T03:55:00.000Z	jamescarr	iceroot	duh
2011-11-02T03:55:00.000Z	jamescarr	iceroot	duh
2011-11-02T03:55:00.000Z	jamescarr	iceroot	there is some backport repo you can use though
2011-11-02T03:55:00.000Z	jamescarr	iceroot	DUH!!
2011-11-02T03:55:00.000Z	jamescarr	iceroot	can you hear me!?
2011-11-02T03:55:00.000Z	jamescarr	iceroot	can you!?
2011-11-02T03:56:00.000Z	jamescarr	iceroot	I want to just use the backport repo that can still be used. I admin several ubuntu boxes and they are upgraded
2011-11-02T03:56:00.000Z	iceroot	jamescarr	9.x is no longer supported, no sec-updates doesnt matter if you use backports
2011-11-02T03:56:00.000Z	jamescarr	iceroot	i know!
2011-11-02T03:56:00.000Z	iceroot	jamescarr	so what is your question?
2011-11-02T03:57:00.000Z	jamescarr	iceroot	there are unofficial apt repos that mirror what the 9 repos had
2011-11-02T03:57:00.000Z	iceroot	jamescarr	i told you its out of support and the normal repos are down
2011-11-02T03:57:00.000Z	iceroot	jamescarr	read the link from ubottu
2011-11-02T03:58:00.000Z	jamescarr	iceroot	I do not feel like spending 2 hours upgrading tonight. I will when my plate is clear
2011-11-02T03:58:00.000Z	iceroot	jamescarr	but googling 2 hours for eol-repos?
