2010-04-30T10:23:00.000Z	KeithWeisshar		do you have a working link to ubuntu 10.04 dvd torrents
2010-04-30T10:24:00.000Z	KeithWeisshar		why is the dvd iso hard to find
2010-04-30T10:25:00.000Z	KeithWeisshar		are there working links to dvd iso's for 10.04 yet?
2010-04-30T10:26:00.000Z	KeithWeisshar		why should ubuntu be downloaded via torrent rather than direct download?
2010-04-30T10:28:00.000Z	KeithWeisshar		bittorrent sometimes crashes my router, it overflows the nat table on the actiontec mi424wr
2010-04-30T10:28:00.000Z	KeithWeisshar		my verizon fios router only has a 1k nat table
2010-04-30T10:30:00.000Z	KeithWeisshar		can torrenting cause the actiontec router to freezes
2010-04-30T10:31:00.000Z	KeithWeisshar		if the nat table on the router becomes full the internet connection can freeze for several minutes and cause all networked users to lose internet connectivity for a period of time
2010-04-30T10:31:00.000Z	FiReSTaRT	KeithWeisshar	and what is your router in the first place (sorry if i missed it)
2010-04-30T10:27:00.000Z	FiReSTaRT	KeithWeisshar	because we're already grateful for a free o.s. and don't wanna rape the mirrors unnecessarily.. also some people (like poor canadians) live in heavily throttled countries so they are forced to dl directly
2010-04-30T10:28:00.000Z	FiReSTaRT	KeithWeisshar	if you are experiencing technical issues with torrenting, by all means hit the servers
2010-04-30T10:31:00.000Z	FiReSTaRT	KeithWeisshar	could also be crappy firmware... what r u running on your router?
2010-04-30T10:33:00.000Z	FiReSTaRT	KeithWeisshar	you may wanna consider running openwrt on it if they have a release for your hardware, which is quite possible
2010-04-30T10:33:00.000Z	FiReSTaRT	KeithWeisshar	on the plus side you get to learn more about linux by running it :D
2010-04-30T10:34:00.000Z	FiReSTaRT	KeithWeisshar	in that case buy your own... tp-link 1043nd can be had for under $70, the hardware rocks and openwrt works great on it
2010-04-30T10:35:00.000Z	FiReSTaRT	KeithWeisshar	another option, if you're less adventurous, is to get a linksys wrt54gl and run tomato on it.. its rock solid even when bonding 3 dsl connections and torrenting the living s*** outta them
2010-04-30T10:36:00.000Z	FiReSTaRT	KeithWeisshar	in that case buy the cheapest piece of hardware you can run openwrt on as it's GUARANTEED to be better than what you have now
2010-04-30T10:36:00.000Z	FiReSTaRT	KeithWeisshar	ahhh ok.. 20/5 would require something more robust.. look into the tplink 1043nd.. dirt cheap, great hardware, can probably handle 3x the speed with no issues :)
2010-04-30T10:38:00.000Z	FiReSTaRT	KeithWeisshar	yikes... nazi germany here we come... doesn't surprise me from verizon.. they're the most canadian of all u.s. telecoms and i don't mean it as a compliment
