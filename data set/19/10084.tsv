2006-07-28T13:07:00.000Z	mkns		anyone know how can i find out what apt repository the linux-restricted-modules-2.6.15-26-386 package should be in?
2006-07-28T13:08:00.000Z	eyequeue	mkns	restricted
2006-07-28T13:08:00.000Z	mkns	eyequeue	- is that main restricted?
2006-07-28T13:08:00.000Z	eyequeue	mkns	no restricted.  main is different
2006-07-28T13:09:00.000Z	mkns	eyequeue	- i have a line in my sources.list reading the following: "deb http://gb.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ dapper-updates main restricted" - so do I need another line the same with the word "main" removed?
2006-07-28T13:09:00.000Z	eyequeue	mkns	main, restricted, universe, multiverse, all different
2006-07-28T13:10:00.000Z	mkns	eyequeue	- ok, I think I just need to go read something about the contents of a sources.list file as I'm somewhat confused
2006-07-28T13:11:00.000Z	eyequeue	mkns	no, on that line "main restricted" means main plus restricted  (it's a space-delimited list, you could change it to "main restricted universe multiverse" if you wanted)
2006-07-28T13:11:00.000Z	eyequeue	mkns	a little clearer now?
2006-07-28T13:11:00.000Z	mkns	eyequeue	- so since I have that in my sources list, how come I can't install it using apt-get?
2006-07-28T13:12:00.000Z	eyequeue	mkns	that line you pasted was "dapper-updates" do you also have a line with restricted for just "dapper"?
2006-07-28T13:13:00.000Z	mkns	eyequeue	- no, i most certainly don't and will therefore add one right now and try it again
2006-07-28T13:13:00.000Z	eyequeue	mkns	cool, then run sudo apt-get update (like after any sources.list change)  then the install command should work
2006-07-28T13:14:00.000Z	mkns	eyequeue	- no, i lied, i do indeed have a line for dapper with main and restricted in it.  I'd already run apt-get update and that package really isn't in the repository
2006-07-28T13:15:00.000Z	eyequeue	mkns	see that from ubotu?
2006-07-28T13:16:00.000Z	eyequeue	mkns	also, always do an apt-get update before checking what's new :)
2006-07-28T13:16:00.000Z	mkns	eyequeue	- i do that regularly when attempting to get a new package... been using Debian for 6 years, Ubuntu for about 8 hours :)
2006-07-28T13:17:00.000Z	mkns	eyequeue	- thx for your help
2006-07-28T13:17:00.000Z	eyequeue	mkns	gotcha :)  welcome btw
