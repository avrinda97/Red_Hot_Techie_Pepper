2010-09-16T15:30:00.000Z	aliverius		guys, is there any package for vlc-cli only?
2010-09-16T15:32:00.000Z	c3l	aliverius	use mplayer :)
2010-09-16T15:35:00.000Z	aliverius	c3l	mplayer comes with no gui deps??
2010-09-16T15:37:00.000Z	c3l	aliverius	I dont even know if there is a gui for mplayer. but no, the package mplayer is only cli, and the most awesom video player, also great for audio files, but in that case I prefer another interface, cplay for insance (also cli) but mplayer is a must have :)
2010-09-16T15:38:00.000Z	aliverius	c3l	i have used smplayer in the past. it was a fairly good frontend.
2010-09-16T15:39:00.000Z	aliverius	c3l	could mplayer network streams be played by other programs such as vlc?
2010-09-16T15:40:00.000Z	c3l	aliverius	once you have mplayer you dont need any other media player
2010-09-16T15:40:00.000Z	c3l	aliverius	maybe im not getting what you are trying to achieve
2010-09-16T15:41:00.000Z	aliverius	c3l	i need to stream over the network, video captured with dvb, and playback in another computer
2010-09-16T15:42:00.000Z	aliverius	c3l	so my question is, will any client reproduce this video?
2010-09-16T15:42:00.000Z	c3l	aliverius	you could just mount the remote with sshfs and play it like its local. but yeah, mplayer supports all kinds of network streams etc, look in the manpage or ask more in #mplayer, cus im no expert
2010-09-16T15:43:00.000Z	c3l	aliverius	wait what, you want to capture video over dvb on computer one and play it on computer 2?
2010-09-16T15:44:00.000Z	aliverius	c3l	exactly
2010-09-16T15:45:00.000Z	c3l	aliverius	sounds interesting, Im not sure how I would do it though, but as I said, #mplayer knows, gl ;)
2010-09-16T15:55:00.000Z	aliverius	c3l	unfortunately the mplayer package has dependencies for X. i need it for a headless server... moreover i found that vlc-nox is cli only
2010-09-16T15:56:00.000Z	c3l	aliverius	ooh, you want the streaming part, not the stream receiveng part. wouldnt it be possible to access the dvb over ssh? eliminating the need for a tool to to the streaming?
2010-09-16T16:01:00.000Z	aliverius	c3l	no idea if ssh will do, maybe it is not suitable for real-time
2010-09-27T20:50:00.000Z	c3l	aliverius	you could set an alias for a command in your ~/.bashrc but I dont know why you'd want to do that in this case
2010-09-27T20:51:00.000Z	aliverius	c3l	i will try what edbianadviced me 1st
