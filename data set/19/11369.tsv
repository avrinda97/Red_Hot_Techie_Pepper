2006-06-12T10:30:00.000Z	alex_		is amarok crashing on anyone after doing the install libmad0 libxine-extracodecs ?
2006-06-12T10:31:00.000Z	Frogzoo	alex_	this 4 kde?
2006-06-12T10:31:00.000Z	alex_	Frogzoo	Yes
2006-06-12T10:31:00.000Z	Frogzoo	alex_	ah, can't say - works fine on gnome though - consider amarok 1.4 though
2006-06-12T10:32:00.000Z	alex_	Frogzoo	is that a downgrade?
2006-06-12T10:32:00.000Z	Frogzoo	alex_	nope - it's latest - 1.3.9 is in the stock repos
2006-06-12T10:33:00.000Z	alex_	Frogzoo	Do you just happen to know if amarok will ONLY work with the xine engine?
2006-07-02T05:10:00.000Z	Frogzoo	alex_	you installed fglrx-kernel-2.6.15-25-386        assuming you're running a 386 kernel, I'd recommend 686 personally
2006-07-02T05:11:00.000Z	Frogzoo	alex_	apt-get install linux-image-2.6.15-25-686            & reboot (will only work on p4 or better)
2006-07-02T05:12:00.000Z	Frogzoo	alex_	should be fine
2006-07-02T05:13:00.000Z	Frogzoo	alex_	you should probly uninstall the ubuntu-fglrx-386 first
2006-07-02T05:13:00.000Z	Frogzoo	alex_	synaptic
2006-07-02T05:15:00.000Z	Frogzoo	alex_	uninstall  ubuntu-fglrx-386 first, then install linux-image-2.6.15-25-686
2006-07-02T05:27:00.000Z	Frogzoo	alex_	you can leave that - just reboot - the 686 wont use the 386 modules
2007-09-01T13:45:00.000Z	Frogzoo	alex_	did you bring the bound IP back up?
2007-09-01T13:45:00.000Z	Frogzoo	alex_	sounds like you just need to restart mysql
2007-09-01T13:46:00.000Z	alex_	Frogzoo	did the trick :)
2007-09-01T13:46:00.000Z	alex_	Frogzoo	I've just installed a gigabit NIC... thought i'd broken things then
2007-09-01T13:48:00.000Z	alex_	Frogzoo	cheers for the help
