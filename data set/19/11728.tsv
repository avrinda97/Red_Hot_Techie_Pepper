2005-11-30T07:14:00.000Z	progbliss	buildg8s	are you asking what settings you can change in order to increase speed?
2005-11-30T07:15:00.000Z	buildg8s	progbliss	 yes, definitely
2005-11-30T07:15:00.000Z	progbliss	buildg8s	OK, now there's two different things I can try to help you speed up. The video card might not be in use, installing drivers might fix that, or it might be the whole system.
2005-11-30T07:16:00.000Z	buildg8s	progbliss	then
2005-11-30T07:16:00.000Z	progbliss	buildg8s	is it just games that are problematic or whole system?
2005-11-30T07:18:00.000Z	progbliss	buildg8s	going to need a little bit to see what's the first thing to tackle...
2005-11-30T07:23:00.000Z	progbliss	buildg8s	That's it? Normal, but you can remove extra stuff. I wouldn't try anything just yet, but if you really want to, see where you can remove stuff. I'd read the Gentoo documentation; Gentoo is very customizable. Bear in mind that not all progs in Gentoo are available in Ubunyu. and lastly, do not switch to gentoo. you will hate yourself later.
2005-11-30T07:24:00.000Z	progbliss	buildg8s	 don't ask me. I'll only kill your system 5 times
2005-11-30T07:27:00.000Z	progbliss	buildg8s	Lose X, you get command line
