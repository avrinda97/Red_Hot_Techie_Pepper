2008-04-29T21:25:00.000Z	John_S		dano: I had to make some changes to my /etc/default/acpi-support file to get my suspend to work--have you messed with that yet?
2008-04-29T21:26:00.000Z	dano-	John_S	no i haven't
2008-04-29T21:26:00.000Z	dano-	John_S	don't know what settings to change
2008-04-29T21:26:00.000Z	dano-	John_S	plus i thought ubuntu switched to pm-utils for a lot of the power management stuff
2008-04-29T21:27:00.000Z	John_S	dano-	Did you ever make changes to that file when you were in gutsy to get your monitor to work OK?
2008-04-29T21:27:00.000Z	dano-	John_S	no, it worked fine with no changes in feisty and gutsy
2008-04-29T21:27:00.000Z	dano-	John_S	it initially worked in gutsy too, sort of
2008-04-29T21:28:00.000Z	dano-	John_S	I was still using 915resolution at that point
2008-04-29T21:28:00.000Z	dano-	John_S	But when i resumed the resolution was really low, and i read that 915resolution was obsolete with the new intel driver
2008-04-29T21:28:00.000Z	dano-	John_S	So i removed it and regenerated my xorg.conf file, and thats when it stopped working
2008-04-29T21:29:00.000Z	John_S	dano-	Well I'm still on Gutsy so I don't know about if Hardy switched to pm-utils or what, but if Hardy still uses that acpi-default file, I could give you some tips of what might help.
2008-04-29T21:30:00.000Z	dano-	John_S	i'm open to suggestions, sure
2008-04-29T21:32:00.000Z	John_S	dano-	The key for me was changing "ACPI_SLEEP_MODE=mem" to "ACPI_SLEEP_MODE=standby" in that acpi-defaults file, I also did a few other tweaks or my sreensaver wouldn't work.
2008-04-29T21:32:00.000Z	dano-	John_S	thanks, which file was that in again?
2008-04-29T21:33:00.000Z	John_S	dano-	/etc/default/acpi-support :)
2008-04-29T21:34:00.000Z	dano-	John_S	cool, thanks
2008-04-29T21:34:00.000Z	John_S	dano-	Let me know if it works, OK? :)
2008-04-29T21:34:00.000Z	dano-	John_S	sure, will i have to reboot before the change takes effect?
2008-04-29T21:35:00.000Z	John_S	dano-	Maybe some Ubuntu Guru here can tell you how to get around that, but yes, I had to reboot. :)
