2005-10-22T11:40:00.000Z	doojin		yes
2005-10-22T11:40:00.000Z	doojin		It's fast
2005-10-22T11:40:00.000Z	doojin		I installed debian through floppy disk
2005-10-22T11:41:00.000Z	doojin		I can't burn a cd
2005-10-22T11:41:00.000Z	doojin		net install with floppy disk boot is ideal
2005-10-22T11:41:00.000Z	nalioth	doojin	installing breezy?
2005-10-22T11:41:00.000Z	nalioth	doojin	the latest version of ubuntu
2005-10-22T11:42:00.000Z	nalioth	doojin	get some woody netinst floppys, and as soon as you get a root account and apt-get and network goin, change out your sources.list for breezys list. then update your apt, and dist-upgrade
2005-10-22T11:43:00.000Z	nalioth	doojin	watch your language please
2005-10-22T11:43:00.000Z	nalioth	doojin	well in this channel "f**k" is not acceptable
2005-10-22T11:45:00.000Z	nalioth	doojin	i just told you how
2005-10-22T11:45:00.000Z	doojin	nalioth	: that's just difficult for me to understand
2005-10-22T11:45:00.000Z	doojin	nalioth	: are you telling me that I have to install debian first?
2005-10-22T11:46:00.000Z	nalioth	doojin	you are using the debian woody net install floppies to install a minimal debian. you need network, apt-get and a root account
2005-10-22T11:47:00.000Z	nalioth	doojin	once you get your woody debian to that state, use the breezy badger sources list, update your apt-get and dist-upgrade
2005-10-22T11:48:00.000Z	doojin	nalioth	: that's bothering I just want a shipped cd now
