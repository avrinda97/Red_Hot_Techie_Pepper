2007-12-10T04:14:00.000Z	n15t0		can is save my options what i changed in bitchx? like the name and the channel?
2007-12-10T04:14:00.000Z	Dr_willis	n15t0	 i would suggest reading the various BitchX tutorials that exist.
2007-12-10T04:38:00.000Z	n15t0	Dr_willis	like what codecs?
2007-12-10T04:39:00.000Z	n15t0	Dr_willis	i could watch it before but for some reason i cant now...
2007-12-10T04:39:00.000Z	n15t0	Dr_willis	waht you mean xine-lib version?
2007-12-10T04:40:00.000Z	n15t0	Dr_willis	waht you mean xine-lib version?
2007-12-10T04:40:00.000Z	Dr_willis	n15t0	 thats the info the player says when i do 'about'
2007-12-10T04:40:00.000Z	Dr_willis	n15t0	 so  it seems to be using the xine firefox plugin
2007-12-10T04:43:00.000Z	Dr_willis	n15t0	 looks like it..  They are playing with the totem plugin.
2007-12-10T04:43:00.000Z	Dr_willis	n15t0	 of course totem has to have the right codecs
2007-12-10T04:47:00.000Z	Dr_willis	n15t0	 guess you need to install some extra things/plugins then
2007-12-10T04:48:00.000Z	Dr_willis	n15t0	 well a fast apt-get search for totem shows   totem-mozilla - Totem Mozilla plugin
2007-12-10T04:51:00.000Z	Dr_willis	n15t0	 with the package manager..  same as you install anything else.
2007-12-10T04:52:00.000Z	Dr_willis	n15t0	 im betting you dont have the package installed.. did you TOTEM is one package and totem-mozilla - is a different packagte
2007-12-10T04:53:00.000Z	Dr_willis	n15t0	 sudo apt-get install totem-mozilla
2007-12-10T04:54:00.000Z	Dr_willis	n15t0	 restart the browser perhaps.. I got no other ideas.  It may be you need some codec files FOR totem. like the w32codecs
2007-12-10T05:12:00.000Z	Dr_willis	n15t0	 with 'screen' you can. :)
2007-12-10T05:16:00.000Z	Dr_willis	n15t0	 right so ya would do BitchX -c #ubuntu or somthing like that..
2007-12-10T05:17:00.000Z	Dr_willis	n15t0	 its a COMMAND line option to BitchX
