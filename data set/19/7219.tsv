2007-10-30T21:51:00.000Z	imscifi		which kernel package comes with the build folder?
2007-10-30T21:51:00.000Z	imscifi		I've tried headers and source, neither give what I need
2007-10-30T21:53:00.000Z	thoreauputic	imscifi	what are you actually trying to do?
2007-10-30T21:53:00.000Z	imscifi	thoreauputic	I'm trying to compile the cisco vpn adapter for wireless access
2007-10-30T21:54:00.000Z	thoreauputic	imscifi	you have installed linux-headers-$(uname -r)  ?
2007-10-30T21:57:00.000Z	thoreauputic	imscifi	apt-cache search suggests it is in several packages including xen-headers - but I don't think that is relevant actually
2007-10-30T21:58:00.000Z	imscifi	thoreauputic	probably not
2007-10-30T21:58:00.000Z	thoreauputic	imscifi	maybe the installer or whatever is looking in the wrong place - you said "locate" can't find it even after a "sudo updatedb" ?
2007-10-30T21:59:00.000Z	imscifi	thoreauputic	correct
2007-10-30T21:59:00.000Z	thoreauputic	imscifi	have you tried installing the full kernel source ( linux-source)
2007-10-30T22:00:00.000Z	imscifi	thoreauputic	I searched through synaptic and selected anything that said kernel source, including the 386 version, if you can, do you have the apt-get for the exact one I should try?
2007-10-30T22:01:00.000Z	thoreauputic	imscifi	try linux-source
2007-10-30T22:01:00.000Z	thoreauputic	imscifi	not "kernel"
2007-10-30T22:01:00.000Z	imscifi	thoreauputic	alright, do you know if thats available off the 386 dvd?  Since I can't connect to the network without the vpn here lol
2007-10-30T22:01:00.000Z	thoreauputic	imscifi	no idea :) Try it and see :)
2007-10-30T22:02:00.000Z	imscifi	thoreauputic	good idea, be back in a few
2007-10-30T23:24:00.000Z	imscifi	thoreauputic	hahaha!
2007-10-30T23:24:00.000Z	imscifi	thoreauputic	finally got the vpn working, had to use an older one
2007-10-30T23:24:00.000Z	thoreauputic	imscifi	ah
