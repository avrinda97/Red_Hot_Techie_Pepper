2007-03-29T05:15:00.000Z	VirhYl3		Hi, is there a volume normalization plugin for Rhythmbox?
2007-03-29T05:16:00.000Z	VirhYl3		I keep feeling like rhythmbox is not the best mp3 player for Ubuntu.
2007-03-29T05:16:00.000Z	VirhYl3		like there must be something better out there.
2007-03-29T05:17:00.000Z	VirhYl3		what about one of the xmms2 front ends?
2007-03-29T05:17:00.000Z	VirhYl3		not as good?
2007-03-29T05:17:00.000Z	_bachus_	VirhYl3	they're still pretty lame
2007-03-29T05:21:00.000Z	_bachus_	VirhYl3	nvu
2007-03-29T05:21:00.000Z	_bachus_	VirhYl3	it's the best one so far
2007-03-29T05:22:00.000Z	_bachus_	VirhYl3	i also use Dreamweaver 4 emulated under wine, works very good
2007-03-29T05:24:00.000Z	_bachus_	VirhYl3	go to the nvu site, there should be instructions on how to add their repository
2007-03-29T05:32:00.000Z	_bachus_	VirhYl3	bz2 is an archive, like zip, it's not installed
2007-03-29T05:37:00.000Z	_bachus_	VirhYl3	the thing you downloaded is a compressed archive. you have to extract it first
2007-03-29T05:37:00.000Z	VirhYl3	_bachus_	OK, done.  now what?
2007-03-29T05:45:00.000Z	_bachus_	VirhYl3	that's the kind of info you have to mention BEFOREHAND!
2007-03-29T05:46:00.000Z	_bachus_	VirhYl3	try installing the package you downloaded, it should work
2007-03-29T05:51:00.000Z	_bachus_	VirhYl3	maybe it needs to be compiled. look for a file called INTALL and README
2007-03-29T05:57:00.000Z	_bachus_	VirhYl3	sudo dpkg -i package.deb
2007-03-29T05:58:00.000Z	_bachus_	VirhYl3	CLose Synaptic first!
