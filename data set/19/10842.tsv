2006-05-06T16:02:00.000Z	herbchef	ompaul	k, thx. I'll try it. Just seems wierd that Totem would be crashing on an Ogg file. Bug buddy crashes too...
2006-05-06T16:03:00.000Z	ompaul	herbchef	that is not normal
2006-05-06T16:05:00.000Z	ompaul	herbchef	do file foo.ogg and check out what it thinks it is
2006-05-06T16:06:00.000Z	herbchef	ompaul	terminal says Ogg Vorbis.
2006-05-06T16:07:00.000Z	herbchef	ompaul	It's a file I recorded using "Sound Recorder". Totem will play for a while, then crash.
2006-05-06T16:07:00.000Z	ompaul	herbchef	and how any other player?
2006-05-06T16:07:00.000Z	ompaul		!dapper
2006-05-06T16:07:00.000Z	herbchef	ompaul	I may just let bug buddy sit here for a while, it's not responding, it may just be taking a while to create a bug report.
2006-05-06T16:07:00.000Z	herbchef	ompaul	I haven't tried any other player. Have any suggestions?
2006-05-06T16:08:00.000Z	ompaul		xmms beep
2006-05-06T16:08:00.000Z	herbchef	ompaul	k, I'll install xmms and give it a go.
2006-05-06T16:08:00.000Z	ompaul	herbchef	you will need universe you okay with that (I think so but some don't know)
2006-05-06T16:09:00.000Z	herbchef	ompaul	Yeah, I have universe right now. Not too familiar with much linux software, but I've heard of xmms before.
2006-05-06T16:09:00.000Z	ompaul	herbchef	actually I am wrong - its in main,
2006-05-06T16:10:00.000Z	herbchef	ompaul	ya, I just found it in "Add Applications". I didn't have to "Synaptic".
2006-05-06T16:11:00.000Z	ompaul	herbchef	yet another way to do something :)
2006-05-06T16:15:00.000Z	herbchef	ompaul	XMMS played through the entire file without crashing. Thx!
2006-05-06T16:17:00.000Z	ompaul	herbchef	:-)
