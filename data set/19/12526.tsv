2005-08-24T07:40:00.000Z	srijith	Pac	if you need to edit the partition table.. you need "sudo fdisk /dev/hda"
2005-08-24T07:41:00.000Z	srijith	Pac	change hda to your system's setting
2005-08-24T07:42:00.000Z	srijith	Pac	thoreauputic is right.. XP is very keen on deleting and formatting anything that you ask it to..
