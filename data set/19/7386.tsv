2007-11-26T22:28:00.000Z	sethk	oj	formatting will not help.  However, if you haven't created the partitions on the drive, then what you are saying makes sense
2007-11-26T22:29:00.000Z	sethk	oj	what file system?
2007-11-26T22:34:00.000Z	sethk	oj	you'll need the UID= and GID= mount options to see ntfs
2007-11-26T22:34:00.000Z	sethk	oj	don't use ntfs unless you are doing something that you need windows to read
2007-11-26T22:37:00.000Z	sethk	oj	either:    chown -R username:groupname /mount/point             or, if you don't want to change owner,   chmod -R a+rw /mount/point
2007-11-26T22:37:00.000Z	sethk	oj	the later makes it read/write for the entire world, which may not be a wise choice.
2007-11-26T22:45:00.000Z	oj	sethk	how do i display all the drives/partitions in CLI ?
2007-11-26T22:45:00.000Z	sethk	oj	fdisk -l /dev/hda    if hda is what we're talking about
2007-11-26T22:51:00.000Z	oj	sethk	: typing fdisk -l /dev/sda3 yeilds > disk /dev/sda3 doesn't contain a valid partition table
2007-11-26T22:51:00.000Z	sethk	oj	not /dev/sda3, /dev
2007-11-26T22:51:00.000Z	sethk	oj	sorry, /dev/sda
2007-11-26T22:52:00.000Z	sethk	oj	fdisk works on a drive, not a partition
2007-11-26T22:52:00.000Z	oj	sethk	okay, trying that,.
2007-11-26T22:54:00.000Z	oj	sethk	after doing that..what else needs to be done?
2007-11-26T22:55:00.000Z	sethk	oj	That just tells us what partitions exist.  So I need the output to know.  Put it on the pastebin
2007-11-26T22:56:00.000Z	oj	sethk	http://www.pastebin.ca/798223
2007-11-26T22:57:00.000Z	sethk	oj	ok, you have two linux partitions and a linux swap partition.  Remind me what we are trying to do.
2007-11-26T22:58:00.000Z	oj	sethk	we're trying to access sda3
2007-11-26T23:04:00.000Z	oj	sethk	sorry if u didn't see my msg before, but we're trying to write to the sda3 partition.
