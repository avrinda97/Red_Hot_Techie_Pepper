2009-06-02T12:30:00.000Z	dsdeiz		uhm, just wanted to know how am i to use the font that was in the list in xfontsel
2009-06-02T12:30:00.000Z	dsdeiz		i wanted to change my font in xterm
2009-06-02T12:31:00.000Z	dsdeiz		xterm kept on saying that it is unable to open the font and switches back to "fixed"
2009-06-02T12:31:00.000Z	dsdeiz		which is the default font i think
2009-06-02T12:32:00.000Z	dsdeiz		i've tried others as well

2009-07-11T05:01:00.000Z	Titan8990	dsdeiz	sorry... i wasn't asking what ftp was, there is an ftp client, "ftp"
2009-07-11T05:01:00.000Z	dsdeiz	Titan8990	yeah, i'd like an ftp package running on console and has an interface like mc
2009-07-11T05:02:00.000Z	Titan8990	dsdeiz	thats called a TUI
2009-07-11T05:02:00.000Z	dsdeiz	Titan8990	ahh i see.. hmm, is there an ftp package that has a tui similar to mc? :)
2009-07-11T05:03:00.000Z	Titan8990	dsdeiz	not that I have seen, maybe an EMACS extension
2009-07-11T05:06:00.000Z	dsdeiz	Titan8990	woah! emacs can do that? emacs sure is nice.. can be browser, mail client, etc..
