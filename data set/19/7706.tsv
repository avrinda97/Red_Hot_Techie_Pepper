2007-07-08T14:06:00.000Z	Dark_Apostrophe		Hello. How does Ubuntu make its packages. So far, I was under the impression that you just snapshot Sid every six months, make a few changes and release it, but someone I'm talking to is disputing that, claiming you make your own packages.
2007-07-08T14:06:00.000Z	Dark_Apostrophe		What is correct?
2007-07-08T14:06:00.000Z	macogw-is-a-girl	Dark_Apostrophe	depends on the package
2007-07-08T14:07:00.000Z	macogw-is-a-girl	Dark_Apostrophe	depends on the package.  they do that, but they also patch whatever's busted in sid or change version for those times when sid's instability means things arent working
2007-07-08T14:07:00.000Z	macogw-is-a-girl	Dark_Apostrophe	and they add more things if they're wishlisted by users
2007-07-08T14:08:00.000Z	macogw-is-a-girl	Dark_Apostrophe	bugfixes too, make their own set of defaults like having intel wifi work out of the box which debian makes you download separately....but the repos match pretty well
2007-07-08T14:09:00.000Z	macogw-is-a-girl	Dark_Apostrophe	if you have something you want that isnt in ubuntu's repos and are using the latest ubuntu release, sid binaries usually work
2007-07-08T14:09:00.000Z	Dark_Apostrophe	macogw-is-a-girl	Yeah, but compatibility with Debian is *very* limited
2007-07-08T14:11:00.000Z	Dark_Apostrophe	macogw-is-a-girl	If that were the whole of the incompatibility problems, the software would still work
2007-07-08T14:12:00.000Z	Dark_Apostrophe	macogw-is-a-girl	That don't get backported :(
2007-07-08T14:13:00.000Z	Dark_Apostrophe	macogw-is-a-girl	I use Sid, and I've had plenty of Ubuntu packages not work on me
2007-07-08T14:13:00.000Z	macogw-is-a-girl	Dark_Apostrophe	idk if both directions work
2007-07-08T14:14:00.000Z	macogw-is-a-girl	Dark_Apostrophe	*shrug* i just know that frets on fire works and a few other games one of my friends wanted worked fine too
2007-07-08T14:14:00.000Z	Dark_Apostrophe	macogw-is-a-girl	Ok
2007-07-08T14:15:00.000Z	Dark_Apostrophe	macogw-is-a-girl	Well, thanks for your help in settling the dispute (in my favour :))
2007-07-08T14:23:00.000Z	Dark_Apostrophe	macogw-is-a-girl	Tell me, would Ubuntu accept any package that has copyrighted components without a license (for example, a game with artwork without a specified license)?
2007-07-08T14:24:00.000Z	macogw-is-a-girl	Dark_Apostrophe	maybe in universe
2007-07-08T14:25:00.000Z	Dark_Apostrophe	macogw-is-a-girl	Thanks again :)
2007-07-08T14:25:00.000Z	macogw-is-a-girl	Dark_Apostrophe	POVaddct says itd be multiverse
