2008-02-13T20:59:00.000Z	d4t4min3r		I have a question
2008-02-13T20:59:00.000Z	d4t4min3r		I d/l the new ubuntu but im out of cd-rs but I do have some blank dvds
2008-02-13T20:59:00.000Z	d4t4min3r		can I use that to burn it to and install
2008-02-13T21:00:00.000Z	neverblue	d4t4min3r	yeah, but you have to extract the image, then make a bootable DVD ISO, which you may burn
2008-02-13T21:00:00.000Z	d4t4min3r	neverblue	how do I do that
2008-02-13T21:00:00.000Z	neverblue	d4t4min3r	its not easy, what are you using to burn with?
2008-02-13T21:00:00.000Z	d4t4min3r		k3b
2008-02-13T21:01:00.000Z	neverblue	d4t4min3r	then you will need to mount the ISO, and use k3b to make a bootable DVD
2008-02-13T21:01:00.000Z	d4t4min3r		well... hum
2008-02-13T21:01:00.000Z	d4t4min3r		how can I mount the iso, by using virual box
2008-02-13T21:02:00.000Z	neverblue	d4t4min3r	sorry, have to reboot, maybe just buy a CDR
2008-02-13T21:02:00.000Z	d4t4min3r		I have a 1 gig flash drive, could I put the cd iso on that and use that?
2008-02-13T21:02:00.000Z	neverblue	d4t4min3r	you can boot from a flash drive to install linux
2008-02-13T21:02:00.000Z	d4t4min3r		so put the cd iso on the flash
2008-02-13T21:02:00.000Z	d4t4min3r		and boot to the flash?
2008-02-13T21:04:00.000Z	d4t4min3r		that seems very hard
2008-02-13T21:04:00.000Z	d4t4min3r		there isn't a already  made flash drive install... or dvd install
2008-02-13T21:04:00.000Z	neverblue	d4t4min3r	then go buy a CDR
2008-02-13T21:05:00.000Z	d4t4min3r	neverblue	im 34 mins from the closest store
