2011-02-25T07:32:00.000Z	Aikar		absolutely no logs are written as to why
2011-02-25T07:33:00.000Z	Aikar		and the first cd installed to work laptop fine
2011-02-25T07:34:00.000Z	Aikar		flash use to trigger it pretty easily on first install
2011-02-25T07:34:00.000Z	Aikar		i thought it may be the sound card, but i just took it out of my system and i still froze
2011-02-25T07:34:00.000Z	Aikar		thats what im thinking
2011-02-25T07:34:00.000Z	Aikar		i never had problems on my old system
2011-02-25T07:34:00.000Z	Aikar		i took my HDD out of old system to put in his new hardware and thats when i had the issues
2011-02-25T07:35:00.000Z	Aikar		(i reinstalled ubuntu thinking that it may of been issue with system swapping)
2011-02-25T07:35:00.000Z	Aikar		smart has a few reallocated clusters yes but still lists as ok, but like i said it didnt do it before switch
2011-02-25T07:36:00.000Z	Aikar		is there no command i can run to enable better logging?
2011-02-25T07:37:00.000Z	g_0_0	Aikar	can you change your hard drive cable to see if that's the problem
2011-02-25T08:00:00.000Z	g_0_0	Aikar	could be a bad cap on MB
2011-02-25T08:02:00.000Z	Aikar	g_0_0	i really dont know what it is, the guy was using it right before he sold it to me and had no issues on windows
2011-02-25T08:04:00.000Z	g_0_0	Aikar	I was talking about a bad capacitor on the motherboard, how old is the machine? A bad cap can cause unpredictable lock ups have a look over the motherboard and check if any of the caps are rounded on top. I'm not saying that's the problem but it's a possibility
2011-02-25T08:04:00.000Z	Aikar	g_0_0	not old, its a Phenom 2 quad core rig, DDR3 mem
2011-02-25T08:05:00.000Z	g_0_0	Aikar	ok less likely then
2011-02-25T08:09:00.000Z	Aikar	g_0_0	weird thing is, before reinstall, flash videos could reproduce the problem very quickly usually. after reinstall id been fine with em, but seems soon as i uninstalled pulseaudio i started crashing. but i also crashed before uninstalling pulseaudio before the reinstall
2011-02-25T08:11:00.000Z	g_0_0	Aikar	integrated sound ? if not you could try a different slot for the sound card
2011-02-25T08:11:00.000Z	Aikar	g_0_0	yeah i switched to integrated and still crashed
