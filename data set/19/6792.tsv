2007-12-24T04:15:00.000Z	tilgovi		I thought I installed ubuntu 64bit but I'm trying to install a .deb that's labeled amd64 and it says amd64 does not match my architecture (i386)...how do I figure this out?
2007-12-24T04:16:00.000Z	HardDisk	tilgovi	you've got i386
2007-12-24T04:17:00.000Z	tilgovi	HardDisk	Damn...I could have sworn I'd installed 64bit....I guess I go back and reinstall
2007-12-24T04:19:00.000Z	HardDisk	tilgovi	that is total nonsense.
2007-12-24T04:20:00.000Z	tilgovi	HardDisk	Please, dude.  Don't accuse me of something crazy like that.
2007-12-24T04:20:00.000Z	tilgovi	HardDisk	I did say "not everyone agrees"
2007-12-24T04:21:00.000Z	tilgovi	HardDisk	Believe me, I know.  I'm clear on the advantages/disadvantages
2007-12-24T04:21:00.000Z	tilgovi	HardDisk	64bit is what I want
2007-12-24T04:24:00.000Z	tilgovi	HardDisk	Nah.  I'm a programmer and kernel hacker.
2007-12-24T04:25:00.000Z	HardDisk	tilgovi	I believe the term is kernel modder.
2007-12-24T04:25:00.000Z	tilgovi	HardDisk	Fair.  I don't generally tend to edit code, but rather play with patches and whatnot.
2007-12-24T04:26:00.000Z	HardDisk	tilgovi	you tried the realtime kernels?
2007-12-24T04:28:00.000Z	tilgovi	HardDisk	Hmm...I don't remember specifically trying it.  I do remember having real time mode of jackd working a while back when I was doing some audio stuff
2007-12-24T04:28:00.000Z	tilgovi	HardDisk	But I don't know if you're referring to something newer with more true real time abilities than that required
2007-12-24T04:28:00.000Z	tilgovi	HardDisk	I know I was running some subset of the rt patches for a while
2007-12-24T04:29:00.000Z	tilgovi	HardDisk	No, sadly.  That's one area where we're really behind and it's the reason I keep a windows partition around.  Makes me die a little inside.
2007-12-24T04:30:00.000Z	tilgovi	HardDisk	Ardour is supposedly really good, but I haven't tried it.  It's probably not a protools replacement though.
2007-12-24T04:31:00.000Z	HardDisk	tilgovi	yea gonna get that stuff for him on a trial box and check it out
2007-12-24T04:31:00.000Z	tilgovi	HardDisk	I've heard great things about ubuntu studio for that sort of thing.  That'd be a good trial box maybe?
