2009-11-08T00:32:00.000Z	daverag		Hey guys I'm in a lot of trouble here, my USB drives and CDrom don't work, at first my USB keyboard & mouse didn't either but I fixed them in Xorg.  I think it might be related to this error after I upgraded Kubuntu Karmic: hald[1108]: segfault at 0 ip 0000000000410e70 sp 00007fff4b74b470 error 4 in hald[400000+56000]
