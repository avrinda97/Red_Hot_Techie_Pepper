2009-08-17T15:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zfe	or try the microsoft reader under wine, consult appdb for compatibility
2011-08-22T00:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zfe	did you MD5 test the ISO you downloaded?
2011-08-22T00:59:00.000Z	zfe	ActionParsnip	how can i do it?
2011-08-22T01:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zfe	as you have failed to MD5 test, you have no way of knowing the data is complete or consistent
2011-08-22T01:03:00.000Z	zfe	ActionParsnip	yes
2011-08-22T01:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zfe	good, please test BEFORE using the file
2011-08-22T01:03:00.000Z	zfe	ActionParsnip	 ok, got it, but i still have the problem
2011-08-22T01:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zfe	did you burn the CD as slowly as possible (if you used a CD)
2012-08-25T18:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zfe	you can use a chroot to put it where you want
2012-08-25T18:51:00.000Z	zfe	ActionParsnip	refit has been replaced by grub
2012-08-25T18:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zfe	is that not good?
