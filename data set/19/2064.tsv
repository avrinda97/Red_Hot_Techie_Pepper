2010-09-20T09:57:00.000Z	Rena1		can anyone suggest a easy way to virtually upload windows xp on my ubuntu?
2010-09-20T09:58:00.000Z	tensorpudding	Rena1	What do you mean by "virtually upload"
2010-09-20T09:58:00.000Z	Rena1		i want to run xp with my ubuntu ... i dont want to have only one os
2010-09-20T09:59:00.000Z	tensorpudding	Rena1	You want to run XP inside Ubuntu, or run them side by side?
2010-09-20T10:00:00.000Z	Rena1		which ever is easier chippy
2010-09-20T10:00:00.000Z	Rena1		i think side by side?
2010-09-20T10:01:00.000Z	Rena1		ohhh. ..
2010-09-20T10:02:00.000Z	tensorpudding	Rena1	Virtualization allows you to run Windows inside Ubuntu, like a program, but it is resource intensive
2010-09-20T10:02:00.000Z	tensorpudding	Rena1	If you have new hardware that supports virtualization extensions you can get better performance
2010-09-20T10:03:00.000Z	Rena1	misterB	Is there a place for stupid people .... that can help you go through step by step on this? cus i really love ubuntu.. but my daughters school has to have xp and i only need that some times not always ...
2010-09-20T10:04:00.000Z	tensorpudding		They introduced multiple accounts in Windows in NT didn't they?
2010-09-20T10:04:00.000Z	Rena1		ohhh so i need the xp disks.. that is the problem.. because i lost them...  and  i dont know how to burn them (just downloaded ubuntu today)
2010-09-20T10:04:00.000Z	tensorpudding		That's not really a big new security feature...
2010-09-20T10:05:00.000Z	tensorpudding		oh, you mean UAC?
2010-09-20T10:05:00.000Z	tensorpudding		I guess that's new.
2010-09-20T10:05:00.000Z	Rena1		not that old
2010-09-20T10:06:00.000Z	Rena1		nope just vista .... OH can i down load visa?
2010-09-20T10:06:00.000Z	tensorpudding	Rena1	If you don't have the XP disks, there is not much you can do to getting XP back on your machine short of obtaining new ones, legally or illegally.
