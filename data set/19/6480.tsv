2011-11-01T13:02:00.000Z	dspstv		really sucks this user interface
2011-11-01T13:04:00.000Z	dspstv		i cant read the name of the dirs in the desktop
2011-11-01T13:05:00.000Z	dspstv		the font color is to close to the desktop background
2011-11-01T13:05:00.000Z	dspstv		but theres no way to choose font color
2011-11-01T13:05:00.000Z	dspstv		before it was
2011-11-01T13:06:00.000Z	dspstv		i dont understand why it inherits from before this settings if one cant tweak them anymore
2011-11-01T13:06:00.000Z	dspstv		in the Appereance panel one cant do customize
2011-11-01T13:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dspstv	then use a different UI. Gnome isn't the only desktop
2011-11-01T13:07:00.000Z	dspstv	ActionParsnip	of course, i will go back to awesome
2011-11-01T13:07:00.000Z	dspstv		but this is just none-sense
2011-11-01T13:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dspstv	problem solved
2011-11-01T13:07:00.000Z	dspstv		revamped or impaired
2011-11-01T13:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dspstv	I've been using LXDE for the last 4 releases, no issues here
2011-11-01T13:08:00.000Z	dspstv	ActionParsnip	is not about the issues with LXDE, is about removing thinsgand making it difficult for the user
2011-11-01T13:08:00.000Z	dspstv		but, i guess you arealso just a user
2011-11-01T13:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dspstv	I'm an ubuntu member, but technically yes
2011-11-01T13:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dspstv	lots grab the gnome based ubuntu and either love or hate the UI
2011-11-01T13:09:00.000Z	dspstv	ActionParsnip	i had gnome before,
2011-11-01T13:10:00.000Z	dspstv	ActionParsnip	is not a question of love or hate
