2007-12-27T19:45:00.000Z	Buyydee		this should restore it
2007-12-27T19:45:00.000Z	Buyydee		welcome
2007-12-27T19:46:00.000Z	Buyydee		Is there anyone familiar with GRUB?
2007-12-27T19:46:00.000Z	wols	Buyydee	ask your question
2007-12-27T19:48:00.000Z	wols	Buyydee	it can be as urgent as it wants, either you give us more info or no one can help you
2007-12-27T19:49:00.000Z	wols	Buyydee	sudo fidisk -l
2007-12-27T19:56:00.000Z	wols	Buyydee	"sudo update-grub" then paste your /boot/grub/menu.lst
2007-12-27T19:59:00.000Z	wols	Buyydee	FULL menu.lst please
2007-12-27T20:01:00.000Z	wols	Buyydee	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/49688/  should work
2007-12-27T20:02:00.000Z	Buyydee	wols	would setup (hd0,2) in the grub command recognise the partition, if your entry worked?
2007-12-28T14:43:00.000Z	Buyydee	wols	thanks for your help yesterday, grub works fine now
2007-12-28T14:45:00.000Z	Buyydee	wols	i was wondering, yes. setup (hd0,2) didn't recognise it, neither did update-grub
2007-12-28T14:47:00.000Z	Buyydee	wols	ok, then i mixed this up
2007-12-28T14:51:00.000Z	Buyydee	wols	i just tried sudo update-grub again, didn't recognise it. can you think of a reason for this? the device is readable in nautilus, ntfs formatted, sata-2
2007-12-28T14:53:00.000Z	Buyydee	wols	thanks for your effort, i'm going to ask again in the forums
