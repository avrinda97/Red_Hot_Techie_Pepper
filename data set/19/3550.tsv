2009-07-20T10:32:00.000Z	dravekx	ikonia	I downloaded lampp and isntructions say to extract to /opt... so I try, and it says "you dont have permission".
2009-07-20T10:33:00.000Z	ikonia	dravekx	opt is owned by root, you'll need sudo, however I suggest you don't download and extract lampp and just install the apache2/mysql-server/php5 packages from synaptic
2009-07-20T10:33:00.000Z	ikonia	dravekx	no Linux based OS will allow non-prvilged users to access root file systems such as /opt
2009-07-20T10:33:00.000Z	dravekx	ikonia	I have no idea what synaptic is. can you enlighten me?
2009-07-20T10:34:00.000Z	ikonia	dravekx	sure, the package manager
2009-07-20T10:43:00.000Z	dravekx	ikonia	in synaptic, how do I know which files to install for apache/mysql/php ? there's a huge list of files when i ran a quick search for apache.
2009-07-20T10:44:00.000Z	ikonia	dravekx	have a read through that URL
2009-07-20T10:49:00.000Z	ikonia	dravekx	security
2009-07-24T01:46:00.000Z	ikonia	dravekx	leaving yourself logged in is never a good idea
2009-07-24T01:55:00.000Z	ikonia	dravekx	you can login as many times as you want - within reason
2009-07-24T02:00:00.000Z	ikonia	dravekx	don't use it then
2009-07-24T02:02:00.000Z	ikonia	dravekx	telnet is not installed by default on ubuntu
2009-07-24T02:04:00.000Z	ikonia	dravekx	what command
2009-07-24T02:05:00.000Z	dravekx	ikonia	I cant get the command out... two to 3 letters and thats it. S-u-d (network error)
2009-07-24T02:05:00.000Z	ikonia	dravekx	sounds like your network is unstable
2009-07-24T02:05:00.000Z	dravekx	ikonia	thats what im thinking.. I need to look at it from the other side.
