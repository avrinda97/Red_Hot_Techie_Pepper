2010-01-19T16:44:00.000Z	amikrop		Hello, recently, the a button, when I press it, writes down something like adsf and lowers the volume.
2010-01-19T16:44:00.000Z	amikrop		Is that a recent bug?
2010-01-19T16:44:00.000Z	amikrop		"a" button
2010-01-19T16:44:00.000Z	hipitihop	amikrop	sounds more like a stuck gummey key on your keyboard
2010-01-19T16:51:00.000Z	amikrop	hipitihop	how can I fix it? it showed up yesterday first time
2010-01-19T16:57:00.000Z	hipitihop	amikrop	sorry, I think I may be answering too many people and lost track ;-)
2010-01-19T17:24:00.000Z	amikrop	hipitihop	I have the problem with pressing "a" and getting "afsd" and lower sound volume (I think only when VLC or YouTube is open)...

2010-01-19T17:27:00.000Z	hipitihop	amikrop	aah, the potential keyboard problem. Do you have another keyboard you can plug in and test ?
2010-01-19T17:28:00.000Z	amikrop	hipitihop	no
2010-01-19T17:28:00.000Z	amikrop	hipitihop	I never had this problem until yesterday
2010-01-19T17:33:00.000Z	amikrop	hipitihop	do you have any ideas? :)
2010-01-19T17:39:00.000Z	hipitihop	amikrop	the only idea I have is that it sounds like a broken or dirty keyboard with one or more of the keys sticking.
2010-01-19T17:40:00.000Z	amikrop	hipitihop	it is a laptop keyboard, so, I shouldn't remove any keys for cleaning, right?
2010-01-19T17:41:00.000Z	hipitihop	amikrop	so you need to eliminate that possibility. One way is to plug in another keyboard. If it works, then you know it is your keyboard. If the problem persists then we would have to look elsewhere. since you do not have naother one, then the only other thing I can think of is to try and clean the keybaord and make sure there is nothing stuck between keys etc.
2010-01-19T17:43:00.000Z	hipitihop	amikrop	I am not a hardware person so I have no idea about laptop keyboards so yes I would advise caution removing anything. A lot of keyboards are usb these days, a frined have one you can borrow ?
2010-01-19T17:44:00.000Z	hipitihop	amikrop	if you really suspect software as the problem, then why don't you boot it from a live-cd
2010-01-19T17:45:00.000Z	amikrop	hipitihop	Dr_Willis: OK, thank you, I 'll try what you both suggested.
2010-01-19T17:46:00.000Z	hipitihop	amikrop	good luck.
