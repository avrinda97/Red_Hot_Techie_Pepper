2006-06-16T10:05:00.000Z	sam_		with the Gnome GLSlideshow screensaver, where do I place pictures for it to cycle?
2006-06-16T10:07:00.000Z	Madpilot	sam_	install xscreensaver again - gnome-screensaver has decided not to actually support existing screensaver features :|
2006-09-12T11:11:00.000Z	Madpilot	sam_	it's in repos - Universe, I think - pretty sure the package is planetpenguin-racer
2006-09-12T11:16:00.000Z	Madpilot	sam_	there are some commercial games w/ Linux versions - all the iD stuff, for example
2006-09-12T12:12:00.000Z	Madpilot	sam_	I'm not sure, and I'm not on my home machine so I can't check easily. Search Synaptic for 'splashscreen'
2007-10-29T04:33:00.000Z	Madpilot	sam_	you know helix player is in the Ubuntu repos? Shouldn't need any command line fiddling to make it work
2007-10-29T04:34:00.000Z	Madpilot	sam_	go Applications->Add/Remove, search for 'helix' then click once. Done.
2007-10-29T04:35:00.000Z	Madpilot	sam_	you'll need to move the dropdown to "All Available Applications" in Add/Remove
2007-10-29T04:37:00.000Z	Madpilot	sam_	probably because you hadn't created it? I've no idea, though - why not just install helix thru add/remove or synaptic?
2007-10-29T04:38:00.000Z	Madpilot	sam_	when you were using the command line, had you changed directories to the Desktop?
2007-10-29T04:40:00.000Z	Madpilot	sam_	do you have a gutsy alternate CD in the drive?
2007-10-29T04:41:00.000Z	Madpilot	sam_	you can't upgrade from feisty to gutsy with a feisty CD
2007-10-29T04:43:00.000Z	Madpilot	sam_	yes. Go System->Admin->Update Manager, it should have a button for "Upgrade To New Version" or similar.
2007-10-29T04:43:00.000Z	Madpilot	sam_	take the feisty CD out, it's just confusing things.
2007-10-29T04:44:00.000Z	Madpilot	sam_	OK, and what does Update Manager say?
2007-10-29T04:45:00.000Z	Madpilot	sam_	"didn't work" is a bit vague... what exactly didn't work, and how did it break?
2007-10-29T04:46:00.000Z	Madpilot	sam_	what downloads what upgrade thing? awfully hard to help you unless you're more specific, mate...
2007-10-29T04:48:00.000Z	Madpilot	sam_	close Update Manager, go System->Admin->Software Sources. Make sure the entries there for the CD are NOT ticked. Then try Update Manager again.
2007-10-29T04:54:00.000Z	Madpilot	sam_	got your upgrade going now?
