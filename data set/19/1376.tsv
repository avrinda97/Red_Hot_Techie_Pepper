2011-03-01T04:03:00.000Z	geoffmcc	nathic	problem you may run into with using a big drive like that is that it needs to be bootable. may be better of getting a $10 2giger flash drive and then it will be super easy to install from usb
2011-03-01T04:52:00.000Z	geoffmcc	nathic	maybe i missed. no live cd available?
2011-03-01T04:53:00.000Z	geoffmcc	nathic	flash drive maybe?
2011-03-01T04:53:00.000Z	nathic	geoffmcc	nah  hard drive
2011-03-01T04:53:00.000Z	geoffmcc	nathic	lol keep on being 1 sec two late
2011-03-01T04:54:00.000Z	geoffmcc	nathic	no cds or no access to burn. cause if u got a cd can just repair windows loader if have that cd then burn ubuntu
2011-03-01T04:56:00.000Z	nathic	geoffmcc	I've neither a cd nor the possibility to burn one nor a flashdrive (except an iPhone is a flashdrive maybe?)
2011-03-01T04:56:00.000Z	geoffmcc	nathic	can update right from you 10.04
2011-03-01T04:56:00.000Z	geoffmcc	nathic	sorry confused msgs
2011-03-01T04:57:00.000Z	geoffmcc	nathic	i wouldnt use the iphone as would need to make bootable and woudlnt wanna trash it - prob wouldnt work anyways
2011-03-01T05:04:00.000Z	geoffmcc	nathic	im sure u dont wanna spend any $ but if u go to radioshack (if in states) plus many others can get flash drive for $10
2011-03-01T05:07:00.000Z	nathic	geoffmcc	:D i have lots of flashdrives at home... that's what's getting on my nerves

2011-03-01T05:07:00.000Z	geoffmcc	nathic	time to put one of em on your keychain :-P
2011-03-01T05:08:00.000Z	geoffmcc	nathic	the post looks easy enough to me
2011-03-01T05:08:00.000Z	nathic	geoffmcc	:D yeah absolutely .. thanks for the link gona test that
