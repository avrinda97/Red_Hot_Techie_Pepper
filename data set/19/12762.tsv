2007-12-08T22:15:00.000Z	richo	ompaul	active  root    16      Test Page                       153600 bytes   how type with "lprm" now?
2007-12-08T22:15:00.000Z	ompaul	richo	lprm 16
2007-12-08T22:16:00.000Z	ompaul	richo	why are you printing as root  -0 that is nuts
2007-12-08T22:16:00.000Z	richo	ompaul	i dont know. just clicked "print test page"
2007-12-08T22:16:00.000Z	ompaul	richo	this is usually an indication that the printer driver is wrong
2007-12-08T22:17:00.000Z	richo	ompaul	ok but i can print with usb... though i cant get lpr working :(
2007-12-08T22:17:00.000Z	richo	ompaul	there are no correct driver for my canon mp800 but ip4200 should do the trick according to google so thats what im running
2007-12-08T22:18:00.000Z	ompaul	richo	setup from that system - admin - printing       -- that may help - and search for a ppd file do download for that
2007-12-08T22:19:00.000Z	richo	ompaul	no ppd file. No drivers for canon mp800. canon ip4200 inside ubuntu and should work.
2007-12-08T22:21:00.000Z	richo	ompaul	well perhaps.
