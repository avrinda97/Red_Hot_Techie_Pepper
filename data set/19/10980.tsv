2006-06-03T11:24:00.000Z	forkmantis		can anyone even point me to documentation on installing packages w/ dependencies onto a machine w/o internet connection?
2006-06-03T11:24:00.000Z	forkmantis		:(
2006-06-03T11:25:00.000Z	forkmantis		I'm trying to put tripwire on my new box
2006-06-03T11:25:00.000Z	forkmantis		and they recommend installing it before connecting your machine to the net
2006-06-03T11:25:00.000Z	forkmantis		once I get it installed, I'll connect the machine to the net
2006-06-03T11:26:00.000Z	forkmantis		katrina: tripwire is a security program that makes a snapshot of the executables and config files on your machine
2006-06-03T11:27:00.000Z	forkmantis		for safety, you are supposed to install it before you risk compromising your system
2006-06-03T11:27:00.000Z	forkmantis		so that you know you have a clean baseline
2006-06-03T11:27:00.000Z	forkmantis		:D
2006-06-03T11:27:00.000Z	neutrinomass	forkmantis	That's verging on paranoia .... if you do have an internet connection, why not use it during installation? (I think I'm getting this right... )
2006-06-03T11:29:00.000Z	neutrinomass	forkmantis	Want another solution? Install on two different partitions on the same PC .... the chances of being compromised twice are treMENdously small. After that, compare the two filesystems using a livecd ...
2006-06-03T11:29:00.000Z	forkmantis	neutrinomass	sounds like a good idea
2006-06-03T11:30:00.000Z	neutrinomass	forkmantis	I'm not sure whether checksuming the two partitions will work.... but try diff-ing them ...
2006-06-03T11:33:00.000Z	neutrinomass	forkmantis	tripswire's deps are minimal. I think you only need 5 or so packages (i.e. 'exim's dependancies) and you're done ....
2006-06-03T11:35:00.000Z	neutrinomass	forkmantis	Ignore, there might be more deps. Anyway, I'm quite sure you don't really need to do that ...
2006-06-03T11:35:00.000Z	forkmantis	neutrinomass	thx.  I want to attempt to do it the recommended way first, and will degrade my plan if  that proves to be too difficult
2006-06-03T11:36:00.000Z	forkmantis	neutrinomass	I was thinking of using this machine to grab the needed packages, then make a local repository, similar to the one shown here:  http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=79896
2006-06-03T11:37:00.000Z	neutrinomass	forkmantis	Yeah, that's not a bad idea either....
2006-06-03T11:38:00.000Z	forkmantis	neutrinomass	so to get the packages, I guess apt-get install --download-only would be the best way?
