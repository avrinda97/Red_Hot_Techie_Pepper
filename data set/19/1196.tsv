2011-04-14T23:16:00.000Z	KNUBBIG		I got this output from fdisk -l on a live CD: http://pastebin.com/3eVHn21e which is obviously wrong. ikonia said that I had to redo all partitions in order to get my Ubuntu installing. Any other solution you know of?
2011-04-14T23:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	KNUBBIG	 whats obviously wrong about it?
2011-04-14T23:17:00.000Z	KNUBBIG	Dr_Willis	the difference between the partitions on the RAID and the ones actually mounted, Ubuntu detects some partitions on sda which is part of a RAID setup and did not use the partitions on md0 which also are detected incorrectly
2011-04-14T23:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	KNUBBIG	 perhaps check cfdisk output and what parted/gparted  says about it.  'fdisk' is getting a little out dated with a lot of these new setups and complex drive layouts.
2011-04-14T23:21:00.000Z	KNUBBIG	Dr_Willis	okay, thanks, I'll try that. I'm worried that neither 10.10 nor 11.04 is able to detect the correct layout especially as everything is working fine in Windows
2011-04-14T23:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	KNUBBIG	 ive given up on using complex raid and other fancy layouts. :) I just do one HD per OS these days.
2011-04-14T23:22:00.000Z	KNUBBIG	Dr_Willis	:D I used to have the setup this way on my old computer, here's the layout as it should be seen in Windows: http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=2qv5url&s=7

2011-04-16T02:37:00.000Z	KNUBBIG	Dr_Willis	is there a tutorial for installing from USB?
2011-04-16T02:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	KNUBBIG	 use a tool to put iso on the usb flash.. and boot it.. install..
2011-04-16T02:38:00.000Z	KNUBBIG	Dr_Willis	okay, thanks ^^
2011-04-29T17:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	KNUBBIG	 /exec  - check the irssi docs for mor einfo  on it.
2011-04-29T17:58:00.000Z	KNUBBIG	Dr_Willis	thank you
2011-07-13T23:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	KNUBBIG	nsf server may be set to only allow access from a  the same network range as its on.  Vbox  can set up its own private network. check the ip#'s
2011-07-13T23:47:00.000Z	KNUBBIG	Dr_Willis	uh well okay, thanks. I will have to look if I have any options to configure on my NAS
2011-07-13T23:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	KNUBBIG	 you can set vbox to  appear on the local lan as if it was a real physical machine.
2011-07-13T23:48:00.000Z	KNUBBIG	Dr_Willis	zykotick9: you, I'll look into it :)
2011-07-13T23:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	KNUBBIG	 i would guess.. nfs security settings. :)
2011-07-13T23:57:00.000Z	KNUBBIG	Dr_Willis	might be but as the options I can change on the NAS are somewhat limited, I dunno :)
