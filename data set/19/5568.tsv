2008-06-30T23:50:00.000Z	ASULutzy		I'm still curious what that privacy violation screennameguy was talking about
2008-06-30T23:50:00.000Z	ikonia	ASULutzy	he didn't say - so please drop the topic
2008-07-08T23:49:00.000Z	ikonia	ASULutzy	don't feed please.
2008-07-16T20:57:00.000Z	ikonia	ASULutzy	you unmount a file system - not a device file
2008-07-16T20:59:00.000Z	ASULutzy	ikonia	I thought you could do it either way? (I realize that it's more technically correct to do sudo umount /media/directory, but doesn't sudo umount /dev/thePartition work too?)
2008-12-22T05:12:00.000Z	ASULutzy	ikonia	mikejet: What's the word on the new 64 bit flash that was released for Linux, I remember reading an announcement in November about it
2008-12-22T05:13:00.000Z	ikonia	ASULutzy	a positive beta release package
2008-12-22T05:21:00.000Z	ASULutzy	ikonia	How is that beta 64 bit flash you mentioned? Worth using, or do you think it's best to hold off
2008-12-22T05:21:00.000Z	ikonia	ASULutzy	it's interesting to use, but not mainstream ready
2008-12-22T05:21:00.000Z	ikonia	ASULutzy	getting there, very positive beta
2008-12-22T05:22:00.000Z	ASULutzy	ikonia	Cool, good to know... I use 64 bit on the desktop, but my desktop is more of a headless server these days than anything else, so Flash hasn't really been a significant concern
2008-12-23T22:10:00.000Z	ASULutzy	ikonia	Would they still not be mountable if it were a hardware RAID?
2008-12-23T22:10:00.000Z	ikonia	ASULutzy	they are not hardware from what he said
2008-12-23T22:12:00.000Z	ASULutzy	ikonia	Ah, I missed that, somethingorigina if it's a software RAID, Ubuntu won't be any help... If you have essential files stored on a RAID-0 that's just a bad idea. Use 1 or 0+1 or something... As far as recovering your files, if they're that valuable you'll probably need a data recovery specialist or something
2009-01-07T22:30:00.000Z	ASULutzy	ikonia	I don't really understand why people get indignant when they're told to go to #ubuntu+1 or #ubuntu-offtopic... Those channels aren't like, second-class channels for has-beens. They're there for a reason.
2009-01-07T22:30:00.000Z	ikonia	ASULutzy	concur
2009-01-07T22:37:00.000Z	ASULutzy	ikonia	Is the native release actually released yet? Or is it still like alpha-beta'ish quality?
2009-01-07T22:37:00.000Z	ikonia	ASULutzy	still beta (official stamp is beta I think)
2009-01-07T22:38:00.000Z	ikonia	ASULutzy	very promising results so far, but not without issue
