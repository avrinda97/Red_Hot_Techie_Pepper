2008-09-28T10:16:00.000Z	dr_willis	owen1	 several ways.. :) this is a good Linux QUIZ question.
2008-09-28T10:16:00.000Z	dr_willis	owen1	 rm -- -r
2008-09-28T10:16:00.000Z	dr_willis	owen1	 rm '-r'
2008-09-28T10:16:00.000Z	owen1	dr_willis	the first one worked!
2008-09-28T10:17:00.000Z	dr_willis	owen1	 now the questionis WHY did it work...
2008-09-28T10:17:00.000Z	owen1	dr_willis	i treid the rm '-r' and it didn't.
2008-09-28T10:17:00.000Z	owen1	dr_willis	awesome
2008-09-28T10:18:00.000Z	owen1	dr_willis	i had this folder for almost 3 months..so annyoing
2008-09-28T10:18:00.000Z	dr_willis	owen1	 you could just use 'mc' and select/delete the file also
2008-09-28T10:20:00.000Z	owen1	dr_willis	what's mc?
2008-09-28T10:20:00.000Z	owen1	dr_willis	do u find mc more efficient than simple terminal commands?
2008-09-28T10:21:00.000Z	dr_willis	owen1	 in many cases.. yes
2008-09-28T10:21:00.000Z	owen1	dr_willis	can u give me a good usage for mc?
2008-09-28T10:21:00.000Z	dr_willis	owen1	 install it and run it and see. its a full featured 2 pane file manager
2008-10-04T09:45:00.000Z	dr_willis	owen1	 will depend on your chipset  to some degree.
2008-10-04T09:46:00.000Z	dr_willis	owen1	 i know how to do it with nvidia. but  not ati/intel.
2008-10-04T09:48:00.000Z	dr_willis	owen1	 tv out - is a bit different from 2nd monitor also...
2008-10-04T09:48:00.000Z	owen1	dr_willis	i want tv out. no need for second monitor. unless it gives the same result.
