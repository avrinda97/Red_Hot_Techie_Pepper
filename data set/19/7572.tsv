2008-01-10T23:31:00.000Z	wizzo_		anyone know why flash lags really bad on my computer with ubuntu but didnt with windows? any fixes?
2008-01-10T23:32:00.000Z	ikonia	wizzo_	they are different version/operating systems, they don't behave the same
2008-01-10T23:33:00.000Z	wizzo_	ikonia	it shouldnt make my computer completely lagged out though...
2008-01-10T23:33:00.000Z	ikonia	wizzo_	depends on your specification
2008-01-10T23:33:00.000Z	ikonia	wizzo_	and configuration
2008-01-10T23:34:00.000Z	wizzo_	ikonia	2.8ghz P4 Hyper Threaded 512mb ram and a 256mb geforce video card...
2008-01-10T23:34:00.000Z	ikonia	wizzo_	rams a bit shy
2008-01-10T23:34:00.000Z	ikonia	wizzo_	how much ram have you assigned to your vm's
2008-01-10T23:34:00.000Z	wizzo_	ikonia	i know :(
2008-01-10T23:34:00.000Z	wizzo_	ikonia	that i have no clue, how would i check that?
2008-01-10T23:35:00.000Z	ikonia	wizzo_	you configured your VM's
2008-06-17T21:42:00.000Z	ikonia	wizzo_	VB is a windows application, mono is as close as it gets
2008-06-17T21:43:00.000Z	wizzo_	ikonia	my friend, who is using windows, sent me some programming he wants me to look at, will mono let me at least view it?
2008-06-17T21:43:00.000Z	ikonia	wizzo_	not really
2008-06-17T21:43:00.000Z	ikonia	wizzo_	unless it's .net
2008-06-17T21:46:00.000Z	wizzo_	ikonia	sorry, quick question, probably dumb, but do you think it would be possible to run visual basic off of wine?
2008-06-17T21:46:00.000Z	ikonia	wizzo_	maybe
2008-06-17T21:47:00.000Z	wizzo_	ikonia	lol better than a no, guess i'll give it a shot, thanks for your help though :)
2008-06-17T21:47:00.000Z	ikonia	wizzo_	welcome
