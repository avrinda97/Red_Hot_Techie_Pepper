2006-08-21T11:18:00.000Z	Lard-O-Lad		there is a good guide to installing azureus on ubuntuguide.org
2006-08-21T11:18:00.000Z	Corporal_Dirge	Lard-O-Lad	the forums version isn't the working way to install it.
2006-08-21T11:19:00.000Z	Lard-O-Lad	Corporal_Dirge	not sure what you mean it worked fine for me?
2006-08-21T11:19:00.000Z	Corporal_Dirge	Lard-O-Lad	They tell you to install from synaptic right?
2006-08-21T11:19:00.000Z	Lard-O-Lad		pretty sure they use apt-get
2006-08-21T11:21:00.000Z	Lard-O-Lad		quarters*
2006-08-21T11:21:00.000Z	Corporal_Dirge	Lard-O-Lad	That's the borked version. You need to manually install the beta then load azureus as root in order to install the swt library, and then you still need to switch to sun java for the right tools, it's just easier to manually install.
2006-08-21T11:22:00.000Z	Lard-O-Lad	Corporal_Dirge	huh strange; oh well, heh, i'd stick with utorrent anyways :)
2006-08-21T11:22:00.000Z	Corporal_Dirge	Lard-O-Lad	You need wine for it to work right?
2006-08-21T11:22:00.000Z	Lard-O-Lad	Corporal_Dirge	yeah, but its worth it
2006-08-21T11:22:00.000Z	Lard-O-Lad	Corporal_Dirge	and i tend to use wine a alot
2006-08-21T11:23:00.000Z	Corporal_Dirge	Lard-O-Lad	Well, I like the Azureus plugins. RSS feeder etc.
2006-08-21T11:23:00.000Z	Lard-O-Lad	Corporal_Dirge	yea, i used to be a huge azureus fan, but its such a resource hog... (at least the old version was)
2006-08-21T11:24:00.000Z	Corporal_Dirge	Lard-O-Lad	I use the CVS versions, cutting edge updates. Plus a voting system is built into Azureus and we can tell them what features we want them to work on.
2006-08-21T11:25:00.000Z	Corporal_Dirge	Lard-O-Lad	I think the memory managment won several months back.
2006-08-21T11:25:00.000Z	Corporal_Dirge		How can I tell how much memory Azureus is taking in Ubuntu?
2006-08-21T11:29:00.000Z	Corporal_Dirge		Wow, Azureus hardly takes any memory in Ubuntu. Sweet!
2006-08-21T11:31:00.000Z	Lard-O-Lad		dont java apps preform better in linux as compared to windows?
2006-08-21T11:32:00.000Z	Corporal_Dirge	Lard-O-Lad	I dunno, I'm still using Sun's java rather than the OSS version since I do a lot of java programming.
