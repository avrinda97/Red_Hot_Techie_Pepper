2009-01-17T12:32:00.000Z	gnutron	maxxist	no its not pulse only
2009-01-17T12:32:00.000Z	maxxist	gnutron	really?
2009-01-17T12:34:00.000Z	gnutron	maxxist	i have pulseaudio uninstalled and use vlc, amarok, audacious everything all works, two sources at once using esound and alsa on intrepid
2009-01-17T12:35:00.000Z	maxxist	gnutron	good to know.  I had pulse installed on my hardy install.  and when I tried to install audacious it wanted to install pulse again...  so i just assumed.
2009-01-17T12:35:00.000Z	maxxist	gnutron	i meant pulse was uninstalled.
2009-01-17T12:35:00.000Z	gnutron	maxxist	intrepid whacked my sound totally, thats how i fixed it.
2009-01-17T12:36:00.000Z	maxxist	gnutron	 pulse buggared my hardy and wine install.  when i removed it everything was glorious.
2009-01-17T12:37:00.000Z	gnutron	maxxist	pulse needs a defibrillater
2009-01-17T12:37:00.000Z	gnutron	maxxist	joke
2009-01-17T12:37:00.000Z	maxxist	gnutron	lol.  seems to be working for me right now.  hehe.
2009-01-17T12:38:00.000Z	gnutron	maxxist	i'll try it again when they fix something or other
2009-01-17T13:07:00.000Z	maxxist	gnutron	what do you think of emerald these days?  is it stable?
2009-01-17T13:10:00.000Z	gnutron	maxxist	i dont use compiz but its installed, i think its coupled w/emerald but i'm noy up on yhat.
2009-01-17T13:11:00.000Z	maxxist	gnutron	i think its just different window frames and such.  but i know it was kinda buggy before.  but that was a couple years ago.
2009-01-17T13:12:00.000Z	gnutron	maxxist	they seem to improve bells and whistles while everything else like sound gets whacked..
2009-01-17T13:14:00.000Z	maxxist	gnutron	I think ubuntu needs to add a package with a bunch of community maintained sound themes in it.  like they did with the gnome themes.  Dust is beautiful.
2009-01-17T13:15:00.000Z	gnutron	maxxist	you have a good idea there. sound themes would be nice.
2009-01-17T13:16:00.000Z	gnutron	maxxist	i would gladly settle for stable sound period.
2009-01-17T13:18:00.000Z	maxxist	gnutron	I just wonder sometimes why so many distros had to jump to pulseaudio.   like it was the best thing since sliced bread.  I havent had much luck with it since they started using it in ubuntu...
