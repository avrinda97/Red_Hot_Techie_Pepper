2009-04-01T09:29:00.000Z	SandGorgon		guys.. I want to have an IRC channel inside my office with certain channels as password protected... a channel for SVN commit logs, etc. - is there any IRC server that you guys recommend ?
2009-04-01T09:31:00.000Z	lstarnes	SandGorgon	practically every ircd supports using '/mode #channel +k password'
2009-04-01T09:32:00.000Z	SandGorgon	lstarnes	all right... I was looking at InspireIRCd cos it has integration with LDAP as well
2009-04-01T09:33:00.000Z	lstarnes	SandGorgon	I would also recommend using atheme as the services package in addition to an ircd like inspircd or ircu.  atheme has some ldap support in its development branch
2009-04-01T09:33:00.000Z	SandGorgon	lstarnes	checking it out..
2009-05-06T09:40:00.000Z	lstarnes	SandGorgon	apt-file search filename
2009-05-06T09:40:00.000Z	SandGorgon	lstarnes	thanks
2009-05-06T09:40:00.000Z	lstarnes	SandGorgon	you might need to run sudo apt-file update
2009-05-06T09:41:00.000Z	SandGorgon	lstarnes	oh.. is there any online place where I can search for mysql_config ?
2009-05-06T09:42:00.000Z	lstarnes	SandGorgon	I'm not sure
2009-07-02T10:07:00.000Z	lstarnes	SandGorgon	there should be a package available for it
2009-07-02T10:08:00.000Z	SandGorgon	lstarnes	look at the blog post - 64 bit FF is crippled
2009-07-02T10:08:00.000Z	lstarnes	SandGorgon	I have had no issues with the PPA builds of it
2009-07-02T10:09:00.000Z	SandGorgon	lstarnes	neither do i , but apparently the javascript engine is going to be 32 bit only... that's the thing they dont tell u
2009-07-02T10:09:00.000Z	lstarnes	SandGorgon	I haven't heard anything about that from mozilla
2009-07-02T10:09:00.000Z	SandGorgon	lstarnes	http://hacks.mozilla.org/2009/06/tracemonkey-demo/#comment-209
2009-07-02T10:09:00.000Z	lstarnes	SandGorgon	and it would make no sense for thr javascript engine to work only on 32-bit when it can be compiled from source
2009-07-26T09:51:00.000Z	lstarnes	SandGorgon	chsh -s $(which zsh) $USER
2009-07-26T09:51:00.000Z	SandGorgon	lstarnes	thanks
