2008-08-03T22:48:00.000Z	am7146		Why does it ignore my modelines?
2008-08-03T22:48:00.000Z	am7146		Maybe I'll quit my job and join xorg fultime.
2008-08-03T22:49:00.000Z	am7146		Oompa, xwilde, can you take a look at this post?

2008-08-03T22:50:00.000Z	am7146		Yoga, did you try  "grep searcingfor *.tex"
2008-08-03T22:51:00.000Z	am7146		oompa, I just made a recommendation to another guy to try copying all the old xorg.conf backups over one by one and ctrl-alt-delete
2008-08-03T22:52:00.000Z	am7146		Yess, Matt!
2008-08-03T22:53:00.000Z	am7146		Sure, Oompa.
2008-08-03T22:54:00.000Z	am7146		geert, can you "lspci | grep audo"
2008-08-03T22:54:00.000Z	am7146		Matt, did you try starting ubuntu in safe graphics mode?
2008-08-03T22:54:00.000Z	unop	am7146	(WW) fglrx: No matching Device section for instance (BusID PCI:1:0:1) found  -- you might want to explicitly state the BusID in xorg.conf
2008-08-03T22:54:00.000Z	am7146	unop	woah!
2008-08-03T22:55:00.000Z	am7146	unop	can you give me a little more info?  Is the busid a parameter for the card?
2008-08-03T22:56:00.000Z	unop	am7146	it's the id as listed by lspci
2008-08-03T22:56:00.000Z	am7146	unop	would that mean that fglrx wasn't working at all???
2008-08-03T22:58:00.000Z	am7146	unop	I'm going to try it right now and I'll be back.
2008-08-03T22:58:00.000Z	unop	am7146	well it is loaded and seems to be working ... but there's quite a few errors in your log
2008-08-03T23:00:00.000Z	unop	am7146	perhaps ..
2008-08-03T23:00:00.000Z	unop	am7146	if you look in the log .. you see it trying to probe quite a few devices
