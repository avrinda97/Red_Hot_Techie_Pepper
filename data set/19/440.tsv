2012-05-24T22:42:00.000Z	t432		Nvedia Driver issue: Attempting to activate driver through "addition hardward" Error Msg: nvidia System Error: E:Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages
2012-05-24T22:43:00.000Z	t432		how do i manually remove it?
2012-05-24T22:44:00.000Z	t432		tried that
2012-05-24T22:44:00.000Z	t432		sudo apt-get purge nvidia-current
2012-05-24T22:45:00.000Z	L3top	t432	I doubt that this is the source package that is the problem
2012-05-24T22:45:00.000Z	L3top	t432	what is the output of dpkg --configure -a
2012-05-24T22:47:00.000Z	L3top	t432	apt-get -f install
2012-05-24T22:47:00.000Z	L3top	t432	sudo apt-get -f install
2012-05-24T22:49:00.000Z	L3top	t432	assuming you have no issues there, I would recommend sudo apt-get install nvidia-current-updates        It is less buggy than nvidia-current (295.40)
2012-05-24T22:53:00.000Z	L3top	t432	do sudo apt-get update from terminal, and then do sudo apt-get install nvidia-current-updates
2012-05-24T22:59:00.000Z	t432	L3top	OK updates installed, get the same message, now?
2012-05-24T23:00:00.000Z	L3top	t432	^
2012-05-24T23:00:00.000Z	L3top	t432	I would reboot
2012-05-24T23:00:00.000Z	t432	L3top	I do? lool
2012-05-24T23:01:00.000Z	t432	L3top	the package is all screwed up, i need to remove it
2012-05-24T23:02:00.000Z	L3top	t432	did it error when you installed it?
2012-05-24T23:02:00.000Z	t432	L3top	Nope, when when I try to activiate the driver through "Addtional Hardware"
2012-05-24T23:03:00.000Z	L3top	t432	ignore that for now please and reboot
2012-05-24T23:03:00.000Z	L3top	t432	again, you have the most current driver available
