2010-03-08T01:55:00.000Z	rkj		hello I seem to have run into a serious problem - error in synaptic when installing a kernel update. Now synatic won't start, instead tells me to run manually "dpkg --configure -a" but when I do I get "gzip: stdout: No space left on device" along with a lot of other failure messages. My /dev/sda3 which has 193MB allocated is full, not sure what I must do to fix it.
2010-03-08T01:56:00.000Z	JoshuaL	rkj	try: sudo apt-get clean, that will remove downloaded packages and clean up some spave
2010-03-08T01:57:00.000Z	JoshuaL	rkj	furthermore I suggest using gparted to make the partition bigger
2010-03-08T01:59:00.000Z	rkj	JoshuaL	apt-get clean did not do it. Can I just change the partition size without screwing up the data on my hard drive?
2010-03-08T02:00:00.000Z	JoshuaL	rkj	i never had problems resizing. But it is recommended to make a backup before doing so
2010-03-08T02:00:00.000Z	JoshuaL	rkj	but im not sure if you have gparted already (you probably cant install it because you dont have any space left). If you dont have it just run the livecd which has gparted on it
2010-03-08T02:01:00.000Z	rkj	JoshuaL	apparently I don't
2010-03-08T02:02:00.000Z	JoshuaL	rkj	try: sudo apt-get autoremove
2010-03-08T02:05:00.000Z	JoshuaL	rkj	you could remove some old kernels
2010-03-08T02:06:00.000Z	JoshuaL	rkj	http://tuxtweaks.com/2009/12/remove-old-kernels-in-ubuntu/
2010-03-08T02:16:00.000Z	JoshuaL	rkj	and did it work?
2010-03-08T02:18:00.000Z	rkj	JoshuaL	i am checking out the link you sent - I have 11 kernel versions listed
2010-03-08T02:24:00.000Z	JoshuaL	rkj	i never do it that way (i use ubuntu-tweak) but sure give it a shot :)
2010-03-08T02:25:00.000Z	rkj	JoshuaL	what's ubuntu-tweak?
2010-03-08T02:26:00.000Z	JoshuaL	rkj	i believe synaptic can do it too, not sure since i always use apt-get
2010-03-08T02:26:00.000Z	JoshuaL	rkj	ubuntu-tweak is a nice application for tweaking little things. http://ubuntu-tweak.com/
2010-03-08T02:32:00.000Z	JoshuaL	rkj	you can remove those .bak files in /boot
2010-03-08T03:28:00.000Z	rkj	JoshuaL	per your suggestion I just tried to install ubuntu-tweak but got this error message: "error: Dependency is not satisfiable: policykit-1-gnome|policykit-1-qt"
2010-03-08T03:28:00.000Z	JoshuaL	rkj	i can not help you with that. sorry
