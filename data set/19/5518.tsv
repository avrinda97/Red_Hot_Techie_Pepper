2008-06-13T18:37:00.000Z	wildthing4ever		hi all, I'm having a problem with the sound in Hardy Heron - I can hear sound, but the quality is pretty bad
2008-06-13T18:37:00.000Z	wildthing4ever		can somebody give me advice on where I can start troubleshooting?
2008-06-13T18:38:00.000Z	wildthing4ever		the quality of the sound in Hardy Heron is pretty bad
2008-06-13T18:39:00.000Z	jimcooncat	wildthing4ever	was the sound quality good with a different os on the same hardware?
2008-06-13T18:39:00.000Z	wildthing4ever		I just upgraded from 7.10 this morning, and the sound quality went bad as a result
2008-06-13T18:39:00.000Z	wildthing4ever		sounds perfect in Vista (dual-boot)
2008-06-13T18:40:00.000Z	wildthing4ever		ok, sure, can you direct me regarding what settings to edit?
2008-06-13T18:40:00.000Z	jimcooncat	wildthing4ever	not that I can really help, but what exactly is different about the sound?
2008-06-13T18:40:00.000Z	wildthing4ever		jimconncat: it sounds like I'm playing from a cheap set of speakers
2008-06-13T18:41:00.000Z	wildthing4ever		sou][ight, will check out alsamixer
2008-06-13T18:41:00.000Z	wildthing4ever		also, I had this quick-launcher (not sure what it's called) on the top-panel - it seems to have disappeared
2008-06-13T18:41:00.000Z	wildthing4ever		how do I get that back?
2008-06-13T18:42:00.000Z	jimcooncat	wildthing4ever	right-click on the top panel, and choose "Add to Panel"
2008-06-13T18:42:00.000Z	wildthing4ever		sou][ight, what exactly do I do in alsamixer?
2008-06-13T18:43:00.000Z	wildthing4ever	jimcooncat	great, what's the application called?
2008-06-13T18:44:00.000Z	wildthing4ever		oops...sorry, I think I'm confusing you by mixing two different issues!
2008-06-13T18:45:00.000Z	wildthing4ever		my problem's that the sound from the system seems to be buggered after the upgrade to Hardy Heron
2008-06-13T18:45:00.000Z	jimcooncat	wildthing4ever	I'm not sure what you might have had for a quick launch applet. Maybe it was a drawer.
2008-06-13T18:45:00.000Z	wildthing4ever	jimcooncat	that's fine, that's not a major issue
