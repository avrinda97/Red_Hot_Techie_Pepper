2012-09-30T16:28:00.000Z	drag0nz	TJ-	hmm how can i run this than? on windows or something?
2012-09-30T16:28:00.000Z	TJ-	drag0nz	do "file <your-file-name>" - that will tell you what kind of file it is, tell us what it reports
2012-09-30T16:29:00.000Z	TJ-	drag0nz	Is this where it comes from? http://www.redsquirrel87.com/trpex.html
2012-09-30T16:30:00.000Z	drag0nz	TJ-	dr_willis, yes, this is exactly where its from
2012-09-30T16:31:00.000Z	drag0nz	TJ-	this is what "file" returns http://pastebin.com/XEctar9e
2012-09-30T16:32:00.000Z	TJ-	drag0nz	I downloaded the ZIP, extracted it, changed to the directory "TRPEX" and did "./trpex" and it runs OK
2012-09-30T16:32:00.000Z	TJ-	drag0nz	Here's its output: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1251621/
2012-09-30T16:35:00.000Z	drag0nz	TJ-	thats weird! this is the output i get: http://pastebin.com/PbFdnGMv
2012-09-30T16:35:00.000Z	TJ-	drag0nz	Do you have it extracted on a 'noexec' mounted file-system?
2012-09-30T16:35:00.000Z	drag0nz	TJ-	i unziped the file using "unzip file.zip" , went to the directory and ran ./trpex and thats what it shows
2012-09-30T16:37:00.000Z	TJ-	drag0nz	show us "ls -altr ~/Documents/psm/TRPEX" please
2012-09-30T16:38:00.000Z	drag0nz	TJ-	bekks, this is the output http://pastebin.com/zZQAcWQA
2012-09-30T16:39:00.000Z	TJ-	drag0nz	Show me also "mount | grep home" please
2012-09-30T16:40:00.000Z	drag0nz	TJ-	http://pastebin.com/X3RgC8Hf
2012-09-30T16:42:00.000Z	TJ-	drag0nz	what Ubuntu release is it? "lsb_release -d"
2012-09-30T16:44:00.000Z	TJ-	drag0nz	Hmmm; that's supposed to be installed by default
2012-09-30T16:45:00.000Z	TJ-	drag0nz	If you hit that kind of issue in future, the one thing we didn't do that would have helped would have been "ldd trpex" which would reveal missing libraries
2012-09-30T16:46:00.000Z	drag0nz	TJ-	aah thats cool.. thats a good command to know
