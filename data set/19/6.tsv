2004-10-02T08:02:00.000Z	tbone	mdz	I have an ATI remote wonder hooked up to this machine.  Randomly the machine will hang during boot when usb.rc tries to initialize the remote.  What can I send you to help debug it?
2004-10-02T08:03:00.000Z	mdz	tbone	you're using the driver from gatos.sourceforge.net?
2004-10-02T08:03:00.000Z	mdz		or is there one in 2.6 new?
2004-10-02T08:03:00.000Z	mdz		now
2004-10-02T08:04:00.000Z	tbone		ya, whatever is there by default
2004-10-02T08:04:00.000Z	tbone		it moved the mouse when it doesn't hang the boot
2004-10-02T08:04:00.000Z	tbone		hangs maybe one out of 3 or 4 boots
2004-10-02T08:05:00.000Z	mdz		I have a box with one of those remotes, but it's on 2.4 using ati_remote from gatos
2004-10-02T08:05:00.000Z	mdz		it also needs lirc, which is why it isn't running 2.6 yet
2004-10-02T08:05:00.000Z	mdz	tbone	nothing on the console when it hangs?
2004-10-02T08:05:00.000Z	mdz	tbone	probably best would be to get a task dump using magic sysrq
2004-10-02T08:06:00.000Z	tbone		I'll try that....are logs from previous boots stored anywhere?  my only option when the boot hangs is to power cycle....unless magic sysrq works, I forgot about that actually
2004-10-02T08:08:00.000Z	tbone		and there is data on the console when it hangs....I've seen I think two versions of the hang....but it happens in approximately the same place each time
2004-10-02T08:10:00.000Z	tbone		oh and congrats to all the devs on a nice package....best gnome distro I've seen yet
2004-10-02T08:11:00.000Z	mdz	tbone	the trouble with magic sysrq is that you'll need to write down the data by hand, unless you have a serial console setup
2004-10-02T08:11:00.000Z	mdz	tbone	if there are messages on the console when it hangs, those would help
2004-10-02T08:11:00.000Z	mdz	tbone	and thanks :-)
2004-10-02T08:11:00.000Z	mdz		good idea, if you can read the text
2004-10-02T08:12:00.000Z	mdz	tbone	anyway, if you can get some hard data about the hang, file a bug
