2010-06-28T04:12:00.000Z	Hardekyn1		Hi, can someone please tell me how to login to my installed ubuntu from the terminal in the liveCD so that I can reinstall grub?
2010-06-28T04:13:00.000Z	un214	Hardekyn1	it's first a matter of mounting your system
2010-06-28T04:13:00.000Z	un214		fdisk -l will list partitions, identify your root (/) partiton
2010-06-28T04:13:00.000Z	Hardekyn1		erusul that's great, but I need to know how to login as root in my installed ubuntu from the terminal in the livecd before I can do any of that
2010-06-28T04:14:00.000Z	Hardekyn1		that's what I'm stuck with, lol
2010-06-28T04:14:00.000Z	un214		mount <devicename> /mnt and check
2010-06-28T04:15:00.000Z	un214		rescue cd is a really strong argument for root shell
2010-06-28T04:15:00.000Z	Hardekyn1		I type sudo lanh and it tells e command not found erusul
2010-06-28T04:15:00.000Z	un214		probably his hostname
2010-06-28T04:15:00.000Z	Hardekyn1		that's my username on the installed ubuntu erusul
2010-06-28T04:16:00.000Z	un214	Hardekyn1	time for a lesson in architecture
2010-06-28T04:16:00.000Z	un214		looks like Typos_King beat me to it
2010-06-28T04:18:00.000Z	Hardekyn1	Typos_King	http://paste2.org/p/895102 <<< Which partition should I mount and install to?
2010-06-28T04:18:00.000Z	un214	Hardekyn1	it's probably /dev/sda5
2010-06-28T04:19:00.000Z	un214	Hardekyn1	we have the advantage here in that the wrong partition simply won't work
2010-06-28T04:21:00.000Z	un214		I saw the article about rootless X server and it sounds like a bad idea to me
2010-06-28T04:21:00.000Z	Hardekyn1	Typos_King	http://paste2.org/p/895107 <<< Is that to be expected with my set-up? Basically am I okay to continue? That was from the grub-update command
2010-06-28T04:21:00.000Z	un214		/proc/mtrr is needed for some drivers and is way too dangerous to expose
2010-06-28T04:22:00.000Z	un214	Hardekyn1	you probably missed binding /dev or /proc or /sys
