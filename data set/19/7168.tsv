2009-01-27T00:15:00.000Z	bazhang	kao	you did the md5? and burned very slowly, doing the disk integrity check afterwards?
2009-01-27T00:16:00.000Z	kao	bazhang	I checked every time and it was always non matching Md5s
2009-01-27T00:16:00.000Z	bazhang	kao	this is the live cd correct? non matching md5 means a corrupt iso
2009-01-27T00:17:00.000Z	kao	bazhang	I downloaded the iso many times using multiple different Torrent Clients.
2009-01-27T00:17:00.000Z	kao	bazhang	It always gets improper MD5
2009-01-27T00:17:00.000Z	bazhang	kao	the livecd?
2009-01-27T00:17:00.000Z	bazhang	kao	the alternate may fare better when the live cd chokes
2009-01-27T00:18:00.000Z	kao	bazhang	I am starting to think it is my Network connection causing these corruptions...
2009-01-27T00:19:00.000Z	bazhang	kao	have you tried with quiet and splash removed as kernel parameters to see the exact errorss?
2009-01-27T00:19:00.000Z	kao	bazhang	No I have not.
2009-01-27T00:19:00.000Z	bazhang	kao	that would help a lot I imagine
2009-01-27T00:20:00.000Z	kao	bazhang	It always shows the errors anyway. CRC Error and many Numbers
2009-01-27T00:21:00.000Z	kao	bazhang	Thank you too for the help, I will try to download it again tonight, My ISP is a Cellular Modem and is only max download 140KB/s
2009-01-27T00:21:00.000Z	bazhang	kao	if all that fails  you may wish to try the minimal iso (9mb) and build from there
2009-01-27T00:22:00.000Z	kao	bazhang	Is there a tutorial on this somewhere?
2009-01-27T00:22:00.000Z	bazhang	kao	on the minimal? it is quite self explanatory and uses a ncurses based installer iirc
2009-01-27T00:23:00.000Z	kao	bazhang	because in order to get my Cell Phone to work as a modem I have to modprobe visor and add a bunch of scripts. and have pppd. Will this be possible on the Minimal Installer?
2009-01-27T00:24:00.000Z	bazhang	kao	okay not sure about that installation method, that sounds problematic with the minimal
2009-01-27T00:24:00.000Z	kao	bazhang	Yes, it is annoying :(
