2011-03-06T09:22:00.000Z	tensorpudding	win189	it's not a menu though
2011-03-06T09:23:00.000Z	win189		i want to remove the predefined settings that i have for my server to auto or to another set but i am useto ipconfigmenu
2011-03-06T09:24:00.000Z	tensorpudding	win189	which predefined settings do you refer
2011-03-06T09:25:00.000Z	win189		cause once the server is on the net its easy for me
2011-03-06T09:25:00.000Z	win189		my ipsettings
2011-03-06T09:25:00.000Z	win189		i want to zero it out and make it auto for now
2011-03-06T09:25:00.000Z	tensorpudding		auto meaning getting addresses through dhcp?
2011-03-06T09:25:00.000Z	win189		yes
2011-03-06T09:27:00.000Z	tensorpudding	win189	you can edit /etc/network/interfaces to configure interfaces
2011-03-06T09:27:00.000Z	win189		using pico right
2011-03-06T09:28:00.000Z	tensorpudding		yes
2011-03-06T09:28:00.000Z	tensorpudding		ethernet adapters are labelled eth0, eth1, etc.
2011-03-06T09:29:00.000Z	tensorpudding		so you want a line such as auto eth0, then iface eth0 inet dhcp
2011-03-06T09:29:00.000Z	tensorpudding		then you can /etc/init.d/networking restart
2011-03-06T09:32:00.000Z	win189	tensorpudding	thanks a lot
2011-03-06T09:35:00.000Z	win189	tensorpudding	one more thing according to apt-get i have openssh-server installed but i still cant seem to connect to it
