2007-10-24T23:28:00.000Z	yapyccky		hello everyone . i need to format a usb disk but when i try with fdisk /dev/sdb i get "unable to read /dev/sdb"
2007-10-24T23:28:00.000Z	yapyccky		what to do?
2007-10-24T23:29:00.000Z	yapyccky		nothing happened
2007-10-24T23:30:00.000Z	johnnybirdman	yapyccky	fdisk is not the same in ubuntu as win
2007-10-24T23:30:00.000Z	johnnybirdman	yapyccky	i think your looking for gparted
2007-10-24T23:31:00.000Z	johnnybirdman	yapyccky	both of what?  what is the output of fdisk -l (that is a small L)
2007-10-24T23:35:00.000Z	yapyccky	johnnybirdman	do u have any ideas?
2007-10-24T23:36:00.000Z	yapyccky	johnnybirdman	if i ask for dmesg | tail i get  end_request: I/O error, dev sdb, sector 0 and Buffer I/O error on device sdb
2007-10-24T23:36:00.000Z	johnnybirdman	yapyccky	i might have missed.  did you try the sudo gparted.  you did say this was usb drive?  what is current format?
2007-10-24T23:37:00.000Z	yapyccky	johnnybirdman	yes i've tryied qtparted but it doesnt want to work. it says it has not possible to create a new partition
2007-10-24T23:38:00.000Z	johnnybirdman	yapyccky	possibly.  i have had luck with testdisk getting back partitions if something went wrong.  it has a live CD you might want to give it a try.
2007-10-24T23:39:00.000Z	yapyccky	johnnybirdman	there is no other way to try to force creating partition?
2007-10-24T23:52:00.000Z	yapyccky	johnnybirdman	checking dmesg | tail
2007-10-24T23:40:00.000Z	johnnybirdman	yapyccky	not that I know of if you cannot see the drive...
2007-10-24T23:41:00.000Z	johnnybirdman	yapyccky	have you tried the drive on other PC's to ensure it works at all?
2007-10-24T23:42:00.000Z	yapyccky	johnnybirdman	yes. it doesnt work. i've tryied also in win
2007-10-24T23:44:00.000Z	johnnybirdman	yapyccky	sorry couldn't help more.  also could try systemrescue cd.  I use that for all my partitioning.
2007-10-24T23:51:00.000Z	johnnybirdman	yapyccky	how do you know it's /dev/sdb  ??
2007-10-24T23:53:00.000Z	johnnybirdman	yapyccky	without the /dev part..
