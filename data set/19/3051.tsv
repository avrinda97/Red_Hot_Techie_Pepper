2010-05-22T21:36:00.000Z	NoobFukaire		is sun java no longer in the repos
2010-05-22T21:36:00.000Z	NoobFukaire		?
2010-05-22T21:37:00.000Z	NoobFukaire		oh ok, makes sense thanks :)
2010-05-22T21:38:00.000Z	NoobFukaire		sun java shows up with apt-cache but is doesn't show up in the software center partners section
2010-05-22T21:39:00.000Z	NoobFukaire		which will work for my purposes but is there a reason it doesn't show up in the partners category (or seemingly at all)?
2010-05-22T21:39:00.000Z	NoobFukaire		yeah like I said, it's fine but I'm just curious why it doesn't show up in the software center
2010-05-22T21:39:00.000Z	NoobFukaire		I only have flash and adobe's horrible pdf reader
2010-05-22T21:40:00.000Z	NoobFukaire		me either but I think it'll be cool when the software center is like an app store / marketplace
2010-05-22T21:40:00.000Z	NoobFukaire		it'd be great to sell commercial software as well as distribute open source software with it
2010-05-22T21:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	NoobFukaire	 i have seen very few comercial games for linux.. there is to be a port of steam out for linux.
2010-05-22T21:41:00.000Z	NoobFukaire		supposedly, phoronix makes of all kinds of fakebs
2010-05-22T21:41:00.000Z	NoobFukaire		I'd love to see it though
2010-05-22T21:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	NoobFukaire	 and the few linux games ive seen.  are normally ports of windows that you buy the iwindows version
2010-05-22T21:42:00.000Z	NoobFukaire	Dr_Willis	and?
2010-05-22T21:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	NoobFukaire	 Linux saves me $$ Because i dont impulse buy
2010-05-22T21:43:00.000Z	NoobFukaire		linux's advantage isn't really that you save money with it (even though I don't doubt it's true in many cases)
2010-05-22T21:43:00.000Z	NoobFukaire		it's just a great common platform, so you don't get ruled by a king
2010-05-22T21:43:00.000Z	NoobFukaire		it's democracy in software form ;)
2010-05-22T21:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	NoobFukaire	its advantage forme is that i save 44 withit.
