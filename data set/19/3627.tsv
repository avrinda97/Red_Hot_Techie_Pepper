2009-11-08T04:46:00.000Z	chrisr		DOes anyone know if there is a decent clipboard tool for Ubuntu that can live on my taskbar? used for storing a history of clipboard entries?
2009-11-08T04:47:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	chrisr	"apt-cache search clipboard | grep manager"
2009-11-08T04:49:00.000Z	chrisr	leaf-sheep	cheers
2009-11-08T04:50:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	chrisr	I think parcellite is quite nice, by the way. ;)
2009-11-08T04:50:00.000Z	chrisr	leaf-sheep	better than glipper?
2009-11-08T04:51:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	chrisr	My opinion? Yes. But we shouldn't take polls. ;)
2009-11-08T04:53:00.000Z	chrisr	leaf-sheep	it only stores a max of 100 history items... i want thousands!
2009-11-08T04:55:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	chrisr	You could submit that for a feature in parcellite -- Unlimited. Meanwhile, if it does not do what you like, try other clipboard manager. :o
2009-11-08T04:57:00.000Z	chrisr	leaf-sheep	I have just installed glipper, is there any way to know what the binary file is called? its not glipper or anything that beings with gl
2009-11-08T04:58:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	chrisr	I don't know. I'll install it right now.
2009-11-08T05:00:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	chrisr	Ahh. It's an applet.
2009-11-08T05:00:00.000Z	chrisr	leaf-sheep	ahh
2009-11-08T05:01:00.000Z	chrisr	leaf-sheep	i cant see it in my applet panel
2009-11-08T05:01:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	chrisr	Don't type glipper.  Try clipboard.
2009-11-08T05:02:00.000Z	chrisr	leaf-sheep	how did you figure that out?
2009-11-08T05:03:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	chrisr	"aptitude show glipper"
2009-11-08T05:03:00.000Z	chrisr	leaf-sheep	nothing for clipboard
2009-11-08T05:04:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	chrisr	Are you certain? Perhaps "killall gnome-panel" will restart the panel and you can find it in the panel applets.
2009-11-08T05:04:00.000Z	chrisr	leaf-sheep	yeah that sorted it
