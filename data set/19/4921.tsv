2009-07-18T01:03:00.000Z	losher	darkangel	start further back. Where did this iso come from, and what do you want to ultimately do with it...
2009-07-18T01:04:00.000Z	darkangel		this .iso came from a dvd and im just trying to shrink them to save room
2009-07-18T01:05:00.000Z	darkangel	losher	eventually maybe re burn to create back up dvds but mainly to make the file size smaler
2009-07-18T01:06:00.000Z	losher	darkangel	there are a lot of options. Mostly it depends how much shrinkage (we call it compression) you need e.g less than 4G, and where you plan to watch the compressed dvd e.g on your PC, or on a regular dvd player?
2009-07-18T01:07:00.000Z	darkangel		if i could compress the files to less that 4 gb that would be amazing, most are coming out about 7 to 7.8 gb per file
2009-07-18T01:07:00.000Z	darkangel		and watching them would be on either or pc or a dvd player
2009-07-18T01:09:00.000Z	losher	darkangel	standard size for a shop bought dvd is around 8G. Most common compressed size is 4G (so you can burn it onto a blank DVD) or 700M (so you can burn it onto a blank CD). Obviously, the more you compress, the worse the quality gets & the longer it takes,
2009-07-18T01:10:00.000Z	darkangel		i understand the more compressed it gets the worse it gets, im looking to compress these files though, do you have a program to do that
2009-07-18T01:12:00.000Z	losher	darkangel	there are several: dvdrip, k9copy, handbrake, wine+dvdshrink, mencoder, transcode. k9copy is probably a good one to start with....
2009-07-18T01:12:00.000Z	darkangel		i've used k9copy before and it didnt work very well for me
2009-07-18T01:14:00.000Z	losher	darkangel	I've never used it myself. Personally I prefer wine+dvdshrink. I hear good things about handbrake. I've also used dvdrip...
2009-07-18T01:16:00.000Z	darkangel		dvdshrink is not free though correct??
2009-07-18T01:16:00.000Z	losher	darkangel	you talking to me?
2009-07-18T01:17:00.000Z	darkangel		yessum
2009-07-18T01:17:00.000Z	losher	darkangel	then you need to use my name, or I'll miss it in this busy channel...
2009-07-18T01:17:00.000Z	darkangel	losher	my bad
2009-07-18T01:18:00.000Z	darkangel	losher	i dont know all the commands and shit in here just figuring it out
2009-07-18T01:20:00.000Z	darkangel		wtf
2009-07-18T01:21:00.000Z	losher	darkangel	windows dvdshrink is free, but diffiicult to find, and no longer maintained. For the really difficult copy protected dvds, I have to rip them using anydvd then compress using nero. Linux compression is years behind windows, unfortunately...
