2005-10-26T06:54:00.000Z	mustard5		I couldn't get mythtv to install properly yesterday...it was driving me crazy
2005-10-26T06:55:00.000Z	ccooke	mustard5	what was the problem?
2005-10-26T06:55:00.000Z	mustard5		authentication problems
2005-10-26T06:55:00.000Z	ccooke	mustard5	with the database?
2005-10-26T06:55:00.000Z	mustard5		yep
2005-10-26T06:55:00.000Z	ccooke	mustard5	ah, okay. easy to fix.
2005-10-26T06:56:00.000Z	ccooke	mustard5	apt-get --purge everything-mythtv-and-mysql-if-you-can, apt-get install mythtv
2005-10-26T06:56:00.000Z	mustard5		yeah, I was often doing that yesterday :D
2005-10-26T06:56:00.000Z	ccooke	mustard5	I've known a couple of people had that problem.
2005-10-26T06:56:00.000Z	mustard5		and removing the mythtv user
2005-10-26T06:56:00.000Z	ccooke		yep.
2005-10-26T06:56:00.000Z	ccooke		that's fixed it every time I've seen the problem
2005-10-26T06:56:00.000Z	mustard5		but still no luck
2005-10-26T06:56:00.000Z	ccooke		very odd.
2005-10-26T06:57:00.000Z	mustard5		mthtv user kept using a password that I didnt know, so I could run as mythtv user, when I changed mythtv user password to something then installation went wacky
2005-10-26T06:57:00.000Z	ccooke	mustard5	okay, try setting the mythtv user password in mysql, then removing all configuration in ~mythtv ?
2005-10-26T06:58:00.000Z	mustard5	ccooke	I'll give it a go another time...mainly because mythtv and skype don't like each other and I have skype installed atm
2005-10-26T06:58:00.000Z	ccooke	mustard5	hmm
2005-10-26T06:59:00.000Z	mustard5	ccooke	the libqt3c-mt.deb conflicts with skypes libqt3cxxxx.deb
