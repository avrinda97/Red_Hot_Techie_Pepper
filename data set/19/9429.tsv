2006-11-07T07:54:00.000Z	LjL	The_Dark_Side_Of	gtkguitune?
2006-11-07T07:55:00.000Z	The_Dark_Side_Of	LjL	no... "guituner"... i find gtkguitune a bit innacurate.....
2006-11-07T07:55:00.000Z	The_Dark_Side_Of	LjL	i am trying other stuff for tuning..
2006-11-07T07:55:00.000Z	LjL	The_Dark_Side_Of	suppose you tried tuneroid as well, it's in the edgy repos
2006-11-07T07:55:00.000Z	LjL	The_Dark_Side_Of	err sorry i meant lingot - tuneroid is another, for KDE, and not in the repos =)
2006-11-07T07:56:00.000Z	The_Dark_Side_Of	LjL	ohh no.. but you came in a very good time :-D let me check out.... altough i never heard of that (or saw about it no the net)
2006-11-07T07:56:00.000Z	The_Dark_Side_Of	LjL	so.. lingot is the one?? does it uses gtk, qt or console?
2006-11-07T07:56:00.000Z	LjL	The_Dark_Side_Of	gtk
2006-11-07T07:56:00.000Z	The_Dark_Side_Of	LjL	nice..
2006-11-07T07:56:00.000Z	The_Dark_Side_Of	LjL	let me grab it :-D
2006-11-07T07:58:00.000Z	LjL	The_Dark_Side_Of	http://zyzstar.kosoru.com/?tuneroid has other links as well
2006-11-07T07:59:00.000Z	LjL	The_Dark_Side_Of	(but as far as the stuff that's in the repos is concerned, i think lingot and gtkguitune is all there is)
2006-11-07T07:59:00.000Z	The_Dark_Side_Of	LjL	thank you very very much dude.... i never saw lingot anywhere..
2006-11-07T07:59:00.000Z	The_Dark_Side_Of	LjL	i saw it.. it seems very fine.. and configurable too.. let me hook the mic and try it..
2006-11-07T08:00:00.000Z	LjL	The_Dark_Side_Of	well, "apt-cache search tuner" does show it ;-P
2006-11-07T08:00:00.000Z	The_Dark_Side_Of	LjL	never did that (ok.. hammer me now :-P)... hehe.. just still with the old references i knew from the past
2006-11-07T08:01:00.000Z	The_Dark_Side_Of	LjL	wow dude.. tuneroid looks real good on the screenshot..
2006-11-07T08:02:00.000Z	LjL	The_Dark_Side_Of	well look at this page if you want to try tuneroid out perhaps http://sourceforge.net/projects/qtuneroid/  -  it should be the same as normal tuneroid, except it only depends on Qt and not on KDE
2006-11-07T08:04:00.000Z	The_Dark_Side_Of	LjL	again.. thanks a lot.. i'll check them :-D
