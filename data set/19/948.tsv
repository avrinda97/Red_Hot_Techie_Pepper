2012-02-18T10:06:00.000Z	Mission		thanks zykotick9
2012-02-18T10:07:00.000Z	zykotick9	Mission	it really depends what you want to configure however, other common settings might be in ~/.profile
2012-02-18T10:07:00.000Z	Mission		well I used to be able to configure it before
2012-02-18T10:07:00.000Z	Mission		I just forgot the directory
2012-02-18T10:08:00.000Z	Mission		bashrc sounds more fimiliar is all
2012-02-18T10:09:00.000Z	Mission		I'm still a little confused
2012-02-18T10:10:00.000Z	Mission		it would be some place where you'd place something like...  cat art.txt
2012-02-18T10:11:00.000Z	zykotick9	Mission	"cat art.txt" is a command with a file.  What do you really want to do?
2012-02-18T10:11:00.000Z	Mission		I want to load ascii art every time I open the linux terminal
2012-02-18T10:12:00.000Z	zykotick9	Mission	playing with MOTD might be what your looking for then.  I'm no help though, good luck.
2012-02-18T10:12:00.000Z	Mission		ok thanks for the help
2012-02-18T10:13:00.000Z	Mission		I think I came accross one earlier today

2012-02-18T10:14:00.000Z	Mission		don't know about notebooks but they do linux computers by a default
2012-02-18T10:19:00.000Z	zykotick9	Mission	FYI i was wrong about MOTD, that doesn't show when you open a terminal
