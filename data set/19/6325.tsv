2008-02-11T12:27:00.000Z	_Oz_		I am still confused by ubuntu's filesystem
2008-02-11T12:27:00.000Z	_Oz_		which says everything about how stupid I am
2008-02-11T12:27:00.000Z	_Oz_		WHERE do applications install??
2008-02-11T12:27:00.000Z	_Oz_		what is the equivalent of C:/Program Files ??
2008-02-11T12:28:00.000Z	_Oz_		speeddemon: /sbin does not appear on the fulesystem hierarchy standard
2008-02-11T12:28:00.000Z	_Oz_		I just don't know where the hell anything is floating around in here
2008-02-11T12:29:00.000Z	_Oz_		where in the /usr folder?
2008-02-11T12:30:00.000Z	gejr	_Oz_	in linux often programs install like this: /usr/bin <- executables /etc/ <- configuration files /home/<user>/.<somefile> <- personal configurations
2008-02-11T12:31:00.000Z	gejr	_Oz_	bigger suites (like openoffice) might go in /opt
2008-02-11T12:32:00.000Z	gejr	_Oz_	because the package manager keeps them arranged ;) you can easily see where the programs were installed.
2008-02-11T12:33:00.000Z	gejr	_Oz_	and i'm pretty sure it's /usr/bin/azureus ?
2008-02-11T12:36:00.000Z	gejr	_Oz_	my favourite way of doing this is: "find / -perm u+x -name "*myprog*"" it search the entire disk (/) for programs that are executable for a user, for a file named "myprog"
2008-02-11T12:37:00.000Z	gejr	_Oz_	i guess locate can do it too, but i never use that. I hate having to do "updatedb" to reindex before every search.
2008-02-11T12:38:00.000Z	gejr	_Oz_	go to commandline and type "which azureus" ?
2008-02-11T12:39:00.000Z	gejr	_Oz_	ah ;)
2008-02-11T12:45:00.000Z	gejr	_Oz_	keep the spirit up, you'll get used to it after a while :)
2008-02-11T12:45:00.000Z	_Oz_	gejr	thanks. :)
2008-02-11T12:46:00.000Z	gejr	_Oz_	you must define your own shortcuts.. google for keyboard shortcuts in gnome if you don't know how.
