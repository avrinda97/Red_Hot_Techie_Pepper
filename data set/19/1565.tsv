2010-12-22T20:29:00.000Z	aaaf		hello everybody, i have a problem with cups and a pdf
2010-12-22T20:29:00.000Z	aaaf		everytime i want to print it the printer says no (on one page)
2010-12-22T20:29:00.000Z	aaaf		i tested it on different pcs (both ubuntu 10.10) and different printers
2010-12-22T20:29:00.000Z	aaaf		Systtem_Default_0, updated to what?
2010-12-22T20:30:00.000Z	aaaf		*System_default_0
2010-12-22T20:31:00.000Z	aaaf		the page in trouble is nothing special, ist just a 3mebs vector graphic
2010-12-22T20:31:00.000Z	aaaf		I'll give it a try
2010-12-22T20:32:00.000Z	histo	aaaf	did you try a different pdf? I have no problems printing them here.
2010-12-22T20:32:00.000Z	aaaf	histo	yes and also all other pages in the same pdf print without any trouble
2010-12-22T20:32:00.000Z	aaaf		it's just one page which doesn't work at all
2010-12-22T20:32:00.000Z	aaaf		one printer has a silent failure (does nothing) the other crashes and restarts
2010-12-22T20:33:00.000Z	aaaf		(at least it looks so from the cups perspective)
2010-12-22T20:33:00.000Z	aaaf		printer disapperars and reapperars
2010-12-22T20:33:00.000Z	aaaf		the printers are connected via usb if that matters
2010-12-22T20:34:00.000Z	histo	aaaf	so other pdf's work?  i'm confused
2010-12-22T20:34:00.000Z	aaaf	histo	yes other pdfs work
2010-12-22T20:35:00.000Z	histo	aaaf	then maybe the problem is with that pdf
2010-12-22T20:35:00.000Z	aaaf	histo	and if i say ,,print page 1-7'' it works
2010-12-22T20:35:00.000Z	aaaf	histo	but not page 8 :-(
