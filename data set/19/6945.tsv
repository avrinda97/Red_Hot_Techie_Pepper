2008-06-11T06:18:00.000Z	s0|		seriosuly how do I expanded the authentication options ubuntu gives me for for wifi
2008-06-11T06:18:00.000Z	Ahadiel	s0|	If you want to use wpa, you need to install wpa_supplicant
2008-06-11T06:18:00.000Z	s0|	Ahadiel	I have
2008-06-11T06:19:00.000Z	Ahadiel	s0|	I'd recommend wicd if you want more control.
2008-06-11T06:19:00.000Z	Ahadiel	s0|	As opposed to networkmanager
2008-06-11T06:19:00.000Z	s0|	Ahadiel	what does that mean, I don't care about the control I just want to connect to a WPA network...
2008-06-11T06:20:00.000Z	s0|	Ahadiel	I have the wpasupplicant package, did you mean a diffrent one?
2008-06-11T06:20:00.000Z	Ahadiel	s0|	Nope. When you try to connect to the network, it *should* prompt you for the key.
2008-06-11T06:21:00.000Z	s0|	Ahadiel	it asks me to tell it what kind of key I am giving it, and none of the option are right
2008-06-11T06:21:00.000Z	Ahadiel	s0|	Are you sure? What option are you looking for?
2008-06-11T06:22:00.000Z	s0|	Ahadiel	any WPA preshared key would be a nice ********'ing sign
2008-06-11T06:23:00.000Z	s0|	Ahadiel	when I click the network I want to connect to it asks me what kind of security it is using and there are Three WEP options and LEAP
2008-06-11T06:23:00.000Z	Ahadiel	s0|	Are you *positive* you have wpa_supplicant installed? If so, try rebooting.
2008-06-11T06:23:00.000Z	s0|	Ahadiel	the package is called wpasupplicant
2008-06-11T06:24:00.000Z	s0|	Ahadiel	there is not underscore
2008-06-11T06:24:00.000Z	Ahadiel	s0|	Well, okay then. I have no idea.
2008-06-11T06:24:00.000Z	s0|		********* ubuntu still sucking
2008-06-11T06:24:00.000Z	Ahadiel	s0|	Not really. WPA works fine for me. All I had to install was wpa supplicant.
2008-06-11T06:25:00.000Z	s0|	Ahadiel	well arn't you special
