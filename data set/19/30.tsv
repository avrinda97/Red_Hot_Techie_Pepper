2012-11-30T17:27:00.000Z	regf	Ny0	many ways - copying whole block device with dd-like tool, copying only used parts with ntfsclone, or even copying just files if you're careful about preserving all file attributes
2012-11-30T17:30:00.000Z	Ny0	regf	it's a damn win8 notebook without dvd restore -.-'
2012-11-30T17:31:00.000Z	Ny0	regf	but in this case is more complex because there is lenovo oneclick recovery
2012-11-30T17:32:00.000Z	Ny0	regf	so is not a standard windows mbr -.-'
2012-11-30T17:33:00.000Z	regf	Ny0	hmm, Win8 may be tricky due to secureboot, GUID partition table and all that stuff
2012-11-30T17:36:00.000Z	Ny0	regf	its a big deal but i'd really like to modify part table preserving the possibility to restore the notebook one day
2012-11-30T17:36:00.000Z	Ny0	regf	in this moment it is a useless pc
2012-11-30T17:37:00.000Z	regf	Ny0	I would probably image the whole disk just in case there are some important bits hidden somewhere
2012-11-30T17:39:00.000Z	Ny0	regf	500 gb O.o
2012-11-30T17:39:00.000Z	regf	Ny0	compress it with gzip (or maybe lzop because it's faaaast)
2012-11-30T17:39:00.000Z	regf	Ny0	most of it is probably filled with zeroes if it's new
2012-11-30T17:40:00.000Z	regf	Ny0	or copy it to a sparse file
2012-11-30T17:41:00.000Z	Ny0	regf	i will try
2012-11-30T17:41:00.000Z	Ny0	regf	tnx
2012-11-30T17:41:00.000Z	regf	Ny0	or a compressed file if the file system supports it (btrfs, NTFS, ZFS)
2012-11-30T17:46:00.000Z	Ny0	regf	what if i copy only win8 partition and i try to fix mbr with win8 cd
2012-11-30T17:50:00.000Z	regf	Ny0	I don't have any experience yet with Win8, that's why I would image the whole disk
2012-11-30T17:52:00.000Z	regf	Ny0	"cp --copy-contents --sparse=always /dev/sdx sdx.img" will create a sparse image (skipping zeros), which shouldn't take much space
2012-11-30T17:54:00.000Z	Ny0	regf	thank you very much
