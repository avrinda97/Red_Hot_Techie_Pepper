2012-01-22T02:45:00.000Z	eightyeight		i have an .iso, and i would like to create a bootable usb with it, as well as boot other operating systems, such as fedora, opensuse, etc
2012-01-22T02:45:00.000Z	eightyeight		i have the usb successfully booting, and i can boot the kernel and initrd, but it fails looking for the cdrom
2012-01-22T02:45:00.000Z	eightyeight		how can i fix thx?
2012-01-22T02:45:00.000Z	eightyeight		do i just put the .iso in the same directory as the kernel/initrd?
2012-01-22T02:45:00.000Z	eightyeight		or do i unpack the .iso?

2012-01-22T02:49:00.000Z	eightyeight	mongy	syslinux. the usb stick boots fine. the ubuntu installer just can't locate the cdrom media
2012-01-22T02:49:00.000Z	mongy	eightyeight	wipe it, install grub2 to it and put the iso somewhere and make a grub.cfg
