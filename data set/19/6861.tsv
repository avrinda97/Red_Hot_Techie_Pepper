2008-01-06T05:28:00.000Z	angel__		 Pici, RyanPrior, WTF? 2gigs are now being used in my brand new hd! what the hell is lost+found?
2008-01-06T05:28:00.000Z	kitche	angel__	it's lost files that have been found
2008-01-06T05:29:00.000Z	angel__	kitche	er how did htey get lost from an empty hd?
2008-01-06T05:29:00.000Z	kitche	angel__	depending on the size of the drive the 5% reserve might be that 2 gigs
2008-01-06T05:29:00.000Z	kitche	angel__	it's not but every hard drive that is formatted ext3 needs that folder really
2008-01-06T05:30:00.000Z	angel__	kitche	RyanPrior ok. i won't sweat it then
2008-01-06T05:30:00.000Z	kitche	angel__	it's used for the journaling during a fsck
2008-01-06T05:31:00.000Z	angel__	kitche	don't know what that is but sounds like i should not mess with it. is it likt dr watson on windoze?
2008-01-06T05:32:00.000Z	kitche	angel__	fsck is like disk check on a bad shutdown
2008-01-06T05:32:00.000Z	angel__	kitche	awesome
2008-01-06T05:33:00.000Z	kitche	angel__	how big is the new drive?
2008-01-06T05:36:00.000Z	angel__	kitche	it is supposed to be a 160gb but gparted says it is a 149gb abd that 2gb are in use
2008-01-06T05:37:00.000Z	kitche	angel__	yeah the 2 gb might be reserved
2008-01-06T06:19:00.000Z	kitche	angel__	there is symlinks
2008-01-06T06:20:00.000Z	angel__	kitche	yeah but i don't want it to be symbolic. i wanr all my apps to see it as if it where the real thing
2008-01-06T06:20:00.000Z	kitche	angel__	then hardlink is the only way to go
2008-01-06T06:21:00.000Z	angel__	kitche	but i though i could not hard link a directory?
2008-01-06T06:22:00.000Z	angel__	kitche	my new HD has 3 directories, one of them being Music. rhythmbox and other apps switch from ~/Music to /mnt/MMedia/Music due to the fact they are "symbolic" links.
