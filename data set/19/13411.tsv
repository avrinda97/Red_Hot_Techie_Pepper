2005-04-07T12:57:00.000Z	drummer87		i can't mount my thumb drive
2005-04-07T12:57:00.000Z	Burgundavia	drummer87	what does dmesg say?
2005-04-07T12:59:00.000Z	Burgundavia	drummer87	you should just be able to plug it in
2005-04-07T13:00:00.000Z	drummer87	Burgundavia	i do but i get this from dmesg:  ehci_hcd 0000:00:02.2: port 1 reset error -110
2005-04-07T13:00:00.000Z	Burgundavia	drummer87	what type of drive do you have?
2005-04-07T13:01:00.000Z	drummer87	Burgundavia	benq 128meg
2005-04-07T13:01:00.000Z	drummer87	Burgundavia	it sometimes works if it's plugged while booting
2005-04-07T13:02:00.000Z	Burgundavia	drummer87	that is odd. You running hoary or warty?
2005-04-07T13:04:00.000Z	Burgundavia	drummer87	have you tried with the livecd on your machine?
2005-04-07T13:04:00.000Z	Burgundavia	drummer87	have you tried on another machine?
2005-04-07T13:05:00.000Z	drummer87	Burgundavia	no and i have no other to try it on
2005-04-07T13:05:00.000Z	Burgundavia	drummer87	hmm. If you have a cd burner, I would try the livecd.
2005-04-07T13:05:00.000Z	drummer87	Burgundavia	it worked in hoary array5 (i think)
2005-04-07T13:06:00.000Z	drummer87	Burgundavia	i'll try the live cd though
2005-04-07T13:06:00.000Z	Burgundavia	drummer87	can you confirm something for me? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inuit <-- do you see squares on this page instead of inuit?
2005-04-07T13:08:00.000Z	drummer87	Burgundavia	yes, some squares
2005-04-07T13:08:00.000Z	Burgundavia	drummer87	ok
2005-04-07T13:31:00.000Z	drummer87	Burgundavia	bak, and exactly same error from live cd
