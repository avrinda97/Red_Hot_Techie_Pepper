2006-03-30T06:57:00.000Z	ToreoAsesino		hello everyone
2006-03-30T06:58:00.000Z	ToreoAsesino		anyone fancy helping a Ubuntu newb?
2006-03-30T06:58:00.000Z	ToreoAsesino		well, just installed it having been curious for a while....
2006-03-30T06:58:00.000Z	ToreoAsesino		bloody XP won't boot; GRUB killed it dead
2006-03-30T06:58:00.000Z	ToreoAsesino		so....
2006-03-30T06:59:00.000Z	ToreoAsesino		i re-ran the install, used LILO instead, and at least then got to boot into something (Linux)
2006-03-30T07:00:00.000Z	ToreoAsesino		any ideas how to get my XP back? It's kinda got lots of important data in there, etc, etc
2006-03-30T07:00:00.000Z	ToreoAsesino		yes, I still see the data, but I don't get the option to boot to it
2006-03-30T07:01:00.000Z	ToreoAsesino		i'm using LILO to boot i think
2006-03-30T07:03:00.000Z	ToreoAsesino		it's bizzare; GRUB detected I had XP fine; everything went swimmingly until the 1st reboot#
2006-03-30T07:03:00.000Z	Frogzoo	ToreoAsesino	here's how to check: sudo dd if=/dev/hda bs=512 count=1 | od -c
2006-03-30T07:04:00.000Z	Frogzoo	ToreoAsesino	yup - & you should see "GRUB" or "LILO" in there depending
2006-03-30T07:04:00.000Z	Frogzoo	ToreoAsesino	here's how to check: sudo dd if=/dev/sda bs=512 count=1 | od -c
2006-03-30T07:04:00.000Z	Frogzoo	ToreoAsesino	true
2006-03-30T07:09:00.000Z	Frogzoo	ToreoAsesino	makes it easier to launch a terminal if you add it to the gnome task bar - right click -> add applet -> application launcher -> accessories -> terminal
2006-03-30T07:10:00.000Z	Frogzoo	ToreoAsesino	here's how to check: sudo dd if=/dev/sda bs=512 count=1 | od -c |grep -i grub
2006-03-30T07:11:00.000Z	Frogzoo	ToreoAsesino	do you see grub mentioned in 'the load of shite' ?
2006-03-30T07:14:00.000Z	Frogzoo	ToreoAsesino	if you see "G R U B" mentioned there, then that's your boot loader, I think LILO will also have its name in there somewhere
2006-03-30T07:15:00.000Z	Frogzoo	ToreoAsesino	we have a winner!
