2006-07-18T05:27:00.000Z	Shigun		Somebody think they could help me isolate a problem/try to find a solution real quick?
2006-07-18T05:28:00.000Z	DarkMageZ	Shigun	no. no-body knows everything. just ask the question and someone might help you
2006-07-18T05:35:00.000Z	Shigun	DarkMageZ	I dont think it worked =P
2006-07-18T05:36:00.000Z	DarkMageZ	Shigun	hmm i'd recommend using the nv driver for xorg for awhile. and seeing if the hardfreeze continues... sure it will be painful missing 3daccel, but to trace the bug
2006-07-18T05:37:00.000Z	Shigun	DarkMageZ	Alright, I will test that.  Means no gaming for me for awhile then, neh *bah*
2006-07-18T05:37:00.000Z	DarkMageZ	Shigun	i can't live without fglrx... i can remember the hour i was without xgl & compiz
2006-07-18T05:38:00.000Z	Shigun	DarkMageZ	Ya, hehe
2006-07-18T05:48:00.000Z	Shigun	DarkMageZ	In Gnome using 'nv', however for some reason, GDM would not start
2006-07-18T05:48:00.000Z	DarkMageZ	Shigun	something is definantly up with your system...
2006-07-18T05:48:00.000Z	Shigun	DarkMageZ	Recommendation on how I should go about fixing things?
2006-07-18T05:49:00.000Z	DarkMageZ	Shigun	i'd search the filed bugs for similar issues, failing there... i'd start testing the hardware for defects
2006-07-18T05:50:00.000Z	Shigun	DarkMageZ	Hardware is fine, as I can boot into other live cds and whatnot, with 0 issues.  This all started with Ubuntu
2006-07-18T05:51:00.000Z	DarkMageZ	Shigun	hmm, i'd search the bugs. then back-up my home directory and start with a clean system (mine gets dirty with all the excess repos). and see if i could replicate on a clean system
2006-07-18T05:52:00.000Z	Shigun	DarkMageZ	Alright, I will probably do that then.  Thank you
2006-07-18T06:04:00.000Z	Shigun	DarkMageZ	I believe my issue to be the nvidia drivers, as I have yet to have a freeze now, doing what I normally do to cause the freeze (which, at the same time, seems completely unrelated to the nvidia drivers).  What would you recommend in the way of getting acceleration, without going through the Apt version?
2006-07-18T06:05:00.000Z	DarkMageZ	Shigun	nvidia should have install instructions on their site
2006-07-18T06:05:00.000Z	Shigun	DarkMageZ	I believe I tried installing from the nvidia version before, and had an issue.  I shall try again though, thank you
2006-07-18T06:10:00.000Z	Shigun	DarkMageZ	I just finished installing the nvidia released version, but I ask; how exactly am I to be sure that I am using the nvidia version, and not the restricted modules version?
2006-07-18T06:11:00.000Z	Shigun	DarkMageZ	Also, even though I have installed the needed drivers, I no longer have direct rendering
