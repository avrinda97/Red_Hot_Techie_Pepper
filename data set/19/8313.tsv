2008-01-06T17:47:00.000Z	WNxCryptic		cool..guess it'll do for now then.
2008-01-06T17:48:00.000Z	WNxCryptic		hehe..yep, already had it typed
2008-01-06T17:48:00.000Z	WNxCryptic		:( 28 megs.
2008-01-06T17:48:00.000Z	WNxCryptic		Noooooooo
2008-01-06T17:48:00.000Z	WNxCryptic		Joy.
2008-01-06T17:48:00.000Z	WNxCryptic		You can tell I'm so happy right now
2008-01-06T17:48:00.000Z	WNxCryptic		PHP is so simple.
2008-01-06T17:48:00.000Z	WNxCryptic		Easy to config and EVERYTHING
2008-01-06T17:49:00.000Z	WNxCryptic		php is weak compared to asp.net...even I can see that
2008-01-06T17:50:00.000Z	pramz	WNxCryptic	not really, getting the right tool for the job which is simple enough is what is needed.
2008-01-06T17:50:00.000Z	WNxCryptic	pramz	of course..I'm not going to use PHP to output static text.
2008-01-06T17:51:00.000Z	WNxCryptic	pramz	there's just limitations of PHP, just like there are limitations to HTML.
2008-01-06T17:51:00.000Z	WNxCryptic		mmm
2008-01-06T17:51:00.000Z	WNxCryptic		Russian is cool
2008-01-06T17:51:00.000Z	pramz	WNxCryptic	i never said php has no limitations, just that asp.net is not necessarily better than php
2008-01-06T17:52:00.000Z	WNxCryptic	pramz	well...no language is "better" than another. But ASP.net is more extensive in its capabilities...
2008-01-06T17:52:00.000Z	WNxCryptic		anyways, I'm off IRC for the moment.
2008-01-06T17:52:00.000Z	WNxCryptic		I'll fix my FTP probs later.
2008-01-06T17:53:00.000Z	pramz	WNxCryptic	asp.net is also restrictive which I do not like, personally I prefer python/django
