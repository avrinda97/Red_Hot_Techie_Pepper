2007-08-07T10:04:00.000Z	Flannel	jhon	Are you sure your IP is correct?
2007-08-07T10:04:00.000Z	jhon	Flannel	yeap! sure!
2007-08-07T10:04:00.000Z	Flannel	jhon	What happens when you connect?  Refused? or what?
2007-08-07T10:06:00.000Z	Flannel	jhon	it says time is over?  What says that?
2007-08-07T10:12:00.000Z	Flannel	jhon	Are you getting connection noise in your sshd logs?
2007-08-07T10:13:00.000Z	Flannel	jhon	Er... then how do you expect to connect with ssh?
2007-08-07T10:14:00.000Z	Flannel	jhon	right.  and I'm asking you to check your sshd logs
2007-08-07T10:17:00.000Z	Flannel	jhon	first make sure sshd is listening, `ps aux | grep sshd`
2007-08-07T10:20:00.000Z	Flannel	jhon	alright, I suppose we determined that when you said you could connect locally.  And you're sure you've forwarded port 22?
2007-08-07T10:20:00.000Z	Flannel	jhon	and you really don't need to repeat everything if I don't reply within 10 seconds
2007-08-07T10:20:00.000Z	Flannel	jhon	Right, so it sounds like a router issue
2007-08-07T10:26:00.000Z	Flannel	jhon	You don't need to edit host.allow, whomever recommended was wrong
2007-08-07T10:27:00.000Z	Flannel	jhon	nothing.  Check your router settings.  I imagine that's the problem.
2007-08-07T10:28:00.000Z	Flannel	jhon	unless you've edited your sshd configuration, it works out of the box.  If you have edited it, you might have bound it to localhost.
2007-08-07T10:31:00.000Z	Flannel	jhon	pastebin your /etc/ssh/sshd_config
