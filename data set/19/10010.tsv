2006-08-12T15:49:00.000Z	Duski		how i can restore partitions on a HDD under ubuntu ?
2006-08-12T15:49:00.000Z	ccooke	Duski	restore in what sense?
2006-08-12T15:49:00.000Z	ccooke	Duski	from a backup? when they've been destroyed?

2006-08-12T15:51:00.000Z	ccooke	Duski	... so, it sounds like your hard disk is starting to die, or has died.
2006-08-12T15:51:00.000Z	ccooke	Duski	have you made *any* changes to it of *any* sort before this happened?
2006-08-12T15:51:00.000Z	ccooke	Duski	new disk? old?
2006-08-12T15:52:00.000Z	ccooke	Duski	right.
2006-08-12T15:52:00.000Z	ccooke	Duski	if you run 'sudo fdisk -ls /dev/hda', does it find any partitions?
2006-08-12T15:53:00.000Z	ccooke	Duski	Unless you are incredibly, incredibly lucky... your disk is dead. Ship it out to a data recovery service if you absolutely must have the data back.
2006-08-12T15:53:00.000Z	ccooke	Duski	be aware that will cost, though
2006-08-12T15:53:00.000Z	ccooke	Duski	right. Sounds dead. You can check it out in another OS just to be sure, though
2006-08-12T15:54:00.000Z	ccooke	Duski	it is *just* this side of possible that there's some bug in the kernel ubuntu is using - but I really doubt it.
2006-08-12T15:55:00.000Z	ccooke	Duski	unless you can pay for data recovery, forget it.
2006-08-12T15:59:00.000Z	Duski	ccooke	is there a easy way how to mount it as a loop device ?
2006-08-12T16:00:00.000Z	ccooke	Duski	you dd the data from the device file, then mount that as a loop device - 'sudo dd if=/dev/hda of=disk_image bs=8192' would do it.
2006-08-13T16:01:00.000Z	ccooke	Duski	however, as you said you get errors... it's hugely unlikely to work
2006-08-13T16:04:00.000Z	ccooke	Duski	it's dead. Get a new one.
2006-08-13T16:09:00.000Z	Duski	ccooke	it's running but till now there was no single record read, ;( will try the 2nd tool & let u know
