2008-12-02T06:24:00.000Z	itai_michaelson		is there a way to toggle between gui and command line without having to reboot?
2008-12-02T06:26:00.000Z	ardchoille	itai_michaelson	not with ctrl_alt+f1, no
2008-12-02T06:24:00.000Z	ardchoille	itai_michaelson	open a terminal
2008-12-02T06:25:00.000Z	itai_michaelson	ardchoille	thats not what i mean
2008-12-02T06:25:00.000Z	ardchoille	itai_michaelson	or do ctrl+alt+f1 (ctrl+alt+f7 to come back to the desktop)
2008-12-02T06:28:00.000Z	ardchoille	itai_michaelson	no, it won't. ctrl+atl+f1 just switches you to tty1
2008-12-02T06:37:00.000Z	ardchoille	itai_michaelson	you don't have to kill anything, just do ctrl+alt+f1 (or f2, or f3, etc)
2008-12-02T06:38:00.000Z	itai_michaelson	ardchoille	but i do want to kill X
2008-12-02T06:38:00.000Z	ardchoille	itai_michaelson	it won't kill x
2008-12-02T06:39:00.000Z	ardchoille	itai_michaelson	if you want to stop x: sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop (or xdm)
2008-12-02T06:40:00.000Z	itai_michaelson	ardchoille	thats what i want! so back to x will be startx ,right?
2008-12-02T06:40:00.000Z	ardchoille	itai_michaelson	sudo /etc/init.d/gdm start (or xdm)
2008-12-02T06:41:00.000Z	itai_michaelson	ardchoille	thank you very much
2008-12-02T06:41:00.000Z	ardchoille	itai_michaelson	yw :)
2008-12-09T12:43:00.000Z	itai_michaelson	ardchoille	let me make sure i understand - i need to apt-get nvidia-glx (on intrepid), correct?
2008-12-09T12:43:00.000Z	ardchoille	itai_michaelson	follow what that web page tells you, I did it differently so it's best to follow the docs
2008-12-09T12:44:00.000Z	itai_michaelson	ardchoille	they all seem to say System->Administration->Hardware Drivers, but i don't have that on xfce
2008-12-09T12:44:00.000Z	ardchoille	itai_michaelson	then you need to be in #xubuntu and find out their method
2008-12-09T12:45:00.000Z	itai_michaelson	ardchoille	ok thanks
