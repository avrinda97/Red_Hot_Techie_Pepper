2011-01-05T04:33:00.000Z	Egyptian1019		hey guys I am still having problems with the black screen and blnking curser even with the fixes. Could this be a problem with 10.10 would you recommend going back to 10.04? this is my first installation of ubuntu
2011-01-05T04:34:00.000Z	KM0201	Egyptian1019	is this a dual boot system?
2011-01-05T04:35:00.000Z	KM0201	Egyptian1019	are you sure you're giving ubuntu enough time to boot?
2011-01-05T04:36:00.000Z	KM0201	Egyptian1019	i cuz i know there's been some "usplash" bugs(ie, the graphic you see while the OS is loading).. and it may look like its not doing anything, and you just see a black screen
2011-01-05T04:37:00.000Z	KM0201	Egyptian1019	hit escape when you see that cursor, and see if it displays text of what is going on
2011-01-05T04:40:00.000Z	KM0201	Egyptian1019	are you getting a grub menu, so that you can choose XP?, if so, does XP boot?
2011-01-05T04:40:00.000Z	KM0201	Egyptian1019	it should have done it during installation... you said you're running two hard drives, right?
2011-01-05T04:41:00.000Z	KM0201	Egyptian1019	do you know how to change your boot sequence in the BIOS?
2011-01-05T04:42:00.000Z	KM0201	Egyptian1019	whichever hard rive is currently "second"  change it to first
2011-01-05T04:43:00.000Z	KM0201	Egyptian1019	ok.
2011-01-05T04:45:00.000Z	KM0201	Egyptian1019	ok... now, switch it back to the other drive, and just let it sit for a minute, and see if it eventualy gets to the ubuntu desktop
2011-01-05T04:48:00.000Z	KM0201	Egyptian1019	any luck on the ubuntu hard drive eventually booting?
2011-01-05T04:49:00.000Z	KM0201	Egyptian1019	ok...
2011-01-05T04:52:00.000Z	KM0201	Egyptian1019	well, you can install just grub, did you try putting grub on a separate partition, or what?
2011-01-05T23:47:00.000Z	KM0201	Egyptian1019	oh no....lol what now?
2011-01-05T23:50:00.000Z	KM0201	Egyptian1019	read here..lol   https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/653770
2011-01-05T23:52:00.000Z	KM0201	Egyptian1019	well, according to one post, there WONT be a fix for it either... it seems isolated to 64bit, but.. i dunno.. never heard this one.
2011-01-05T23:52:00.000Z	KM0201	Egyptian1019	are you still able to log in normally, or does the machine cease booting, etc?
2011-01-05T23:53:00.000Z	KM0201	Egyptian1019	if you log in, and type "startx" no quotes, and hit ener, what happens?
