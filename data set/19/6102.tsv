2008-03-12T17:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		but without ssh.. well. that makes it harder.
2008-03-12T17:28:00.000Z	quakky	Dr_Willis	haha
2008-03-12T17:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	quakky	 it seems the xgl package goofs up a link for the nvidia drivers. If you reinstalled the nvidia drivers that should of also fixed the problem.
2008-03-12T17:29:00.000Z	quakky	Dr_Willis	all these youtube videos of spinning cubes and transparent stuff...mmmmmm...one day i shall have that
2008-03-12T17:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	quakky	 the cube is one of the most useless things ive ever seen. :)
2008-03-12T17:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	quakky	  try to enable the effects now?
2008-03-12T17:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		that card should be able to do them. but it may be some quirk with the nvidia drivers and that card.
2008-03-12T17:31:00.000Z	quakky	Dr_Willis	well..if the wife walks in when ur doing 'special' work, that cube can save u a few hours of argument lol... jk
2008-03-12T17:32:00.000Z	quakky	Dr_Willis	im still not able to enable the visuals
2008-03-12T17:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	quakky	 thats why i now get all my wallpaper from the National Geographic web site or the nasa picture of the day site
2008-03-12T17:33:00.000Z	quakky	Dr_Willis	i wanna point out that in my restricted drivers window, I c 2 components...1 called Lucent/agere linmodem controller driver (not in use) and the NVIDIA accelerated graphics driver (latest cards) in use
2008-03-12T17:34:00.000Z	quakky	Dr_Willis	shouldnt there be only 1?
2008-03-12T17:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	quakky	 like it says.. One is for your modem. :)
2008-03-12T17:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	quakky	  amazing helpfull eh? if ya dont use the modem dont worry about it.
2008-03-12T17:37:00.000Z	quakky	Dr_Willis	well..i forgot to mention..this wasnt there before the thing hit the fan
2008-03-12T17:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	quakky	 its possible thjeres some DRI/GLX issue with the driver/card versions.    The next release of ubuntu is due out in a month. with updated drivers. That may fix some things.
2008-03-12T17:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	quakky	 also if you havent done a 'sudo apt-get update' 'sudo apt-get upgrade'  yet. it may update some packages that fixes the issue.
2008-03-12T17:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		well night all
2008-03-12T17:39:00.000Z	quakky	Dr_Willis	good night
