2007-10-21T05:09:00.000Z	shnastybiznastic		I'm getting some distortion when playing mp3s since upgrading to 7.10.  anyone know what's up with that?
2007-10-21T05:10:00.000Z	jnc	shnastybiznastic	haven't tried it yet for my desktop, are your volume settings too high?  anything over 70% will clip on most sound chips
2007-10-21T05:10:00.000Z	shnastybiznastic	jnc	even with my volume below 50% on both pcm and main it clips
2007-10-21T05:11:00.000Z	jnc	shnastybiznastic	bummer, dude.
2007-10-21T05:11:00.000Z	shnastybiznastic	jnc	I'm using aqualung, if that helps any
2007-10-21T05:11:00.000Z	jnc	shnastybiznastic	the acid test is using alsaplayer-gtk to playback
2007-10-21T05:12:00.000Z	shnastybiznastic	jnc	alright, I'll see qhat alsaplayer outputs
2007-10-21T05:14:00.000Z	shnastybiznastic	jnc	huh, I installed alsaplayer, but it's not autocompleting orvisible in the menu
2007-10-21T05:14:00.000Z	jnc	shnastybiznastic	"alsaplayer-gtk"
2007-10-21T05:14:00.000Z	jnc	shnastybiznastic	I run it from commandline mostly
2007-10-21T05:15:00.000Z	shnastybiznastic	jnc	the autocomplete or "alsa" only has "alsamixer" and "alsactl"
2007-10-21T05:15:00.000Z	jnc	shnastybiznastic	the name of the program binary is "alsaplayer"
2007-10-21T05:15:00.000Z	jnc	shnastybiznastic	the package to install is "alsaplayer-gtk"
2007-10-21T05:16:00.000Z	jnc	shnastybiznastic	I don't know, maybe I am wrong?
2007-10-21T05:16:00.000Z	shnastybiznastic	jnc	I know, I installed it from the package manager.  It wanted a few extra libraries, but it doesn't autocomplete on the commandline
2007-10-21T05:17:00.000Z	jnc	shnastybiznastic	eh.  don't know
2007-10-21T05:17:00.000Z	shnastybiznastic	jnc	well, thanks, I'll try and post a howto once I get it working
2007-10-21T05:37:00.000Z	shnastybiznastic	jnc	you are going to love this:  the root of my earlier problem was the default installation of aqualung *being turned up too loud*
2007-10-21T05:38:00.000Z	jnc	shnastybiznastic	wow, that deserves a lol.
