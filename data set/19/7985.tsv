2007-06-10T06:57:00.000Z	ebees	kkd	okay
2007-06-10T06:57:00.000Z	kkd		my computer is running ubuntu presently and what i am trying to do is
2007-06-10T06:58:00.000Z	kkd		i have a shared drive in the places on the top menu called f:  'smb f'
2007-06-10T06:59:00.000Z	kkd		my software such as azureus doesnt seem to recognize this drive . is there a way to make it recognizable by other software
2007-06-10T07:01:00.000Z	ebees	kkd	why do you want azureus to notice this drive?
2007-06-10T07:04:00.000Z	kkd		i want it to read the torrents that i started to download under windows
2007-06-10T07:05:00.000Z	kkd	ebees	 i want it to read the torrents that i started to download under windows
2007-06-10T07:05:00.000Z	ebees	kkd	I see. I'm afraid I can't think of a simple answer. I'd suggest a quick check of ubuntuforms.org unless someone can provide a simple solution here.
2007-06-10T07:06:00.000Z	ebees		I'd say that the permissions on the drive require setting. If you've got ntfs on the windows drives, you'll also have to check the repos (can't remember the name) for an app that lets you write to ntfs.
2007-06-10T07:06:00.000Z	kkd	ebees	is there an easy way to share folders between computers in a home networking ?
2007-06-10T07:08:00.000Z	ebees	kkd	samba is your friend :) The issue you need to overcome is WHERE you're saving the file. This is why I would check the forum first. There you go: ubotu has give you a link
2007-06-10T07:08:00.000Z	kkd	ebees	thank you
2007-06-10T07:09:00.000Z	ebees	kkd	no probs. If you do a bit of reading, you'll find (on the ubuntuforum) that there are a lot of people who have probably listed an easy way to do it.
2007-06-10T07:11:00.000Z	ebees	kkd	check this post - http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=468640&highlight=share+windows+drive
2007-06-10T07:11:00.000Z	ebees	kkd	particularly the comments by 'dmizer' - he seems to have created a 'how to'
2007-06-10T07:13:00.000Z	ebees	kkd	just checking to make sure you can access the URL i posted? :)
