2010-05-04T05:59:00.000Z	queso		Just installed Lucid, my volume control disappeared from my notification area.  How do I get it back?
2010-05-04T05:59:00.000Z	haavaros	queso	Tried right-clicking and adding volume control?
2010-05-04T06:00:00.000Z	queso	haavaros	In the 'Add to Panel' dialog?  Yes, "Volume Control" isn't an option there.
2010-05-04T06:01:00.000Z	haavaros	queso	weird. Did you upgrade or do a clean install?
2010-05-04T06:01:00.000Z	queso	haavaros	Upgrade
2010-05-04T06:04:00.000Z	queso	haavaros	I can control the volume using System->Preferences->Sound, but obviously that's not as convenient
2010-05-04T06:07:00.000Z	haavaros	queso	is volume control ticked off in System / Preferences / Start-Up Applications?
2010-05-04T06:07:00.000Z	queso	haavaros	It's not even listed there :/
2010-05-04T06:11:00.000Z	haavaros	queso	gnome-volume-control seems to be a part of gnome-media. Can you check it's status in Synaptic?
2010-05-04T06:13:00.000Z	queso	haavaros	gnome-media is installed
2010-05-04T06:14:00.000Z	haavaros	queso	I'd suggest marking it for reinstalling
2010-05-04T06:14:00.000Z	haavaros	queso	see if that helps
2010-05-04T06:14:00.000Z	queso	haavaros	okay, I'll try that.  when I run gnome-volume-control in a console, it opens up the same window as System->Preferences-Sound
2010-05-04T06:16:00.000Z	queso	haavaros	Shouldn't there just be some command I can run that would open it up?  if you edit Volume Control in Startup Programs, what command is there?
2010-05-04T06:16:00.000Z	haavaros	queso	It's gnome-volume-control-applet
2010-05-04T06:17:00.000Z	queso	haavaros	haa, that did it, lol.  thanks for your help!  I'll try reinstalling gnome-media anyway, maybe it'll add it the way it should be.
2010-05-04T06:18:00.000Z	haavaros	queso	Np. Yeah, or just add it to startup programs
2010-05-04T06:18:00.000Z	queso	haavaros	Thanks again ;)
2010-05-04T06:19:00.000Z	haavaros	queso	glad to help :)
