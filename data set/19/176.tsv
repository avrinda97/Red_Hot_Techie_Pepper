2012-07-15T22:25:00.000Z	vuzzbox_	mangrepawksed	what are trying to accomplish?
2012-07-15T22:25:00.000Z	vuzzbox_		maybe I can help.
2012-07-15T22:26:00.000Z	mangrepawksed	vuzzbox_	: connect to an existing MySql database via LibreOffice Base
2012-07-15T22:26:00.000Z	vuzzbox_		mangreawksed: gotcha - and that requires JDBC drivers?
2012-07-15T22:27:00.000Z	vuzzbox_		and you want to connect to LibreOffice Base so you can administer that database?
2012-07-15T22:27:00.000Z	vuzzbox_	mangrepawksed	and you want to connect to LibreOffice Base so you can administer that database?
2012-07-15T22:28:00.000Z	mangrepawksed	vuzzbox_	: It would seem that it either requires a JDBC driver or an ODBC driver.  Yes, Id like to admin that database using LibreOffice Base.
2012-07-15T22:29:00.000Z	vuzzbox_	mangrepawksed	and by administer I mean, create tables and all - not just provide a user interface for editing the data
2012-07-15T22:29:00.000Z	mangrepawksed	vuzzbox_	yes, exactly.
2012-07-15T22:29:00.000Z	vuzzbox_	mangrepawksed	ok - I know someone asked this, but why not phpmyadmin?
2012-07-15T22:30:00.000Z	mangrepawksed	vuzzbox_	: yes, nana said that right before leaving.  I dunno.  I do have my phpmyadmin setup correctly, and it should do.  However, I've been getting negative reactions from people who generally discourage using it.
2012-07-15T22:30:00.000Z	mangrepawksed	vuzzbox_	: so I guess the actual answer is that I don't know why not
2012-07-15T22:31:00.000Z	vuzzbox_	mangrepawksed	as an administrative interface, phpmyadmin is really fine.
2012-07-15T22:32:00.000Z	mangrepawksed	vuzzbox_	: k.  I'll use phpmyadmin instead of trying to setup LibreOffice base.  Tx.
2012-07-15T22:32:00.000Z	vuzzbox_	mangrepawksed	it's not application interface, though. just a solid admin intreface
2012-07-15T22:32:00.000Z	mangrepawksed	vuzzbox_	: that's what glassfish is for   :P
2012-07-15T22:33:00.000Z	vuzzbox_	mangrepawksed	exactly
2012-07-15T22:33:00.000Z	vuzzbox_	mangrepawksed	don't listen to the naysayers - phpmyadmin will work just fine.
2012-07-15T22:33:00.000Z	vuzzbox_	mangrepawksed	good luck with it
