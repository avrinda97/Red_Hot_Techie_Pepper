2006-02-25T06:54:00.000Z	robbie_		theres no repos in sources.list that dont start with deb so uncommenting them all basically gives me a blank sources.list
2006-02-25T06:54:00.000Z	robbie_		commenting them all I mean
2006-02-25T06:54:00.000Z	robbie_		no no I mean every line that has something on it now has a # after I put a # in front of all the lines starting with deb
2006-02-25T06:55:00.000Z	robbie_		giving me a virtual blank sources.list
2006-02-25T06:56:00.000Z	robbie_		its here http://pastebin.com/563650
2006-02-25T06:57:00.000Z	robbie_		what about the line that has cdrom in it?
2006-02-25T06:58:00.000Z	robbie_		all done, doing apt-get update now
2006-02-25T06:59:00.000Z	robbie_		I deleted the cdrom line alltogether
2006-02-25T06:59:00.000Z	robbie_		ok
2006-02-25T06:59:00.000Z	mustard5	robbie_	the CD rom line is not absolutely necessary, so thats fine...the same packages on the CD are online as well
2006-02-25T07:01:00.000Z	mustard5	robbie_	I'd let it do its thing first
2006-03-17T14:30:00.000Z	mustard5	robbie_	see above line to the wrong nick :)
2006-03-17T14:36:00.000Z	mustard5	robbie_	try Shift + numlock
2006-03-17T14:36:00.000Z	mustard5	robbie_	then use the num pad for directions
2006-03-17T14:36:00.000Z	mustard5	robbie_	its very slow
2006-03-17T14:37:00.000Z	mustard5	robbie_	I had to google it in the end
