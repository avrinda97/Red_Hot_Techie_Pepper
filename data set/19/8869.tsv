2007-12-08T10:53:00.000Z	wckdkl0wn		is there an ftp client for linux that will allow me to extract passworded rar files on a server i have full rights to?
2007-12-08T10:53:00.000Z	kelsin	wckdkl0wn	I'm confused, you're end goal is to copy a file and unrar on a server you have an account on?
2007-12-08T10:54:00.000Z	wckdkl0wn	kelsin	i just uploaded like 20 rars to my webhost but now i need to extract them on the server. it was easier to upload the rars instead of the thousands of files
2007-12-08T10:54:00.000Z	kelsin	wckdkl0wn	do you have ssh access?
2007-12-08T10:54:00.000Z	kelsin	wckdkl0wn	so you can log in and run unrar (if they have it installed)
2007-12-08T10:55:00.000Z	kelsin	wckdkl0wn	well you're first step to being able to work on the server (not just copy and move files) is to get a shell account, after that you won't be so stuck, but the ftp protocol (afaik) doesn't allow you to run random programs on the host, so you'll need to unrar locally then upload
2007-12-08T10:56:00.000Z	kelsin	wckdkl0wn	just "ssh user@whatever.com" unless they do crazy other stuff
2007-12-08T10:56:00.000Z	wckdkl0wn	kelsin	can i pm you?
2007-12-08T10:56:00.000Z	kelsin	wckdkl0wn	no
2007-12-08T10:57:00.000Z	wckdkl0wn	kelsin	ty that worked i was able to connect then
2007-12-08T10:58:00.000Z	kelsin	wckdkl0wn	so if they have the unrar ultility you're all set, otherwise might not be, if that's the case maybe you should unrar locally all of the files, then tar them up and copy them up to the server
2007-12-08T11:02:00.000Z	kelsin	wckdkl0wn	ssh is JUST like the teminarl on your computer, so saying "in ssh" doesn't apply for that question, and unfortunatley no. Tar handles tar files (and can handle gzipping and bzipping the tar files for you) For rar you need unrar afaik
2007-12-08T11:05:00.000Z	kelsin	wckdkl0wn	he means if your server doesn't have unrar, you can probably copy the actually unrar program to the server since it's only one binary file, then run it there (as long as their running linux too)
2007-12-08T11:06:00.000Z	kelsin	wckdkl0wn	listen to nickrud and copy rar etc
2007-12-08T11:07:00.000Z	kelsin	wckdkl0wn	scp -P 2222 /usr/bin/rar user@system:~/
2007-12-08T11:07:00.000Z	kelsin	wckdkl0wn	then anywhere on the remote system the copied rar program can be run with "~/rar args" where args is whatever arguments rar needs to run
2007-12-08T11:08:00.000Z	wckdkl0wn	kelsin	/usr/bin/rar: No such file or directory
2007-12-08T11:08:00.000Z	kelsin	wckdkl0wn	so clearly you need to install rar on your system first
2007-12-08T11:11:00.000Z	wckdkl0wn	kelsin	ok rar is on the server. what arguments would i use if i am extracting a split rar file that is passworded? sorry i am a noob to linux
