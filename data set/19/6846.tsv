2007-11-28T13:03:00.000Z	labinns1		II was able to print to PDF in Edgy Eft and Feisty Fawn but despite attempting numerous "How tos" I am still unable to get it to work in Gutsy Gibbon. Can anyone help?
2007-11-28T13:03:00.000Z	MatthewV	labinns1	print to PDF should be there by default in gutsy
2007-11-28T13:14:00.000Z	labinns1	MatthewV	I have tried printing pages to PDF but even though it looks like they are being printed, I cannot find them in the PDF directory. Are the being saved somewhere else?
2007-11-28T13:15:00.000Z	MatthewV	labinns1	hmm thats interesting... i see what you mean.. i'll see if i can find where it goes
2007-11-28T13:16:00.000Z	MatthewV	labinns1	so its not in ~/PDF/
2007-11-28T13:17:00.000Z	labinns1	MatthewV	Stumped me as well
2007-11-28T13:17:00.000Z	MatthewV	labinns1	yeh i found mine in ~/PDF/ so its possible there's something strange set for you... i'm looking now
2007-11-28T13:20:00.000Z	labinns1	MatthewV	Are you showing a virtual PDF printer in System>Administration>Printer?
2007-11-28T13:21:00.000Z	MatthewV	labinns1	yes... i can actually find the pdf's in /home/USER/PDF
2007-11-28T13:22:00.000Z	labinns1	MatthewV	Can you tell me what is the configuration of your PDF printer?
2007-11-28T13:23:00.000Z	MatthewV	labinns1	if you run the command  cat /etc/cups/cups-pdf.conf | grep Out you should find a line (second for me) that reads Out ${HOME}/PDF or something like that
2007-11-28T13:24:00.000Z	MatthewV	labinns1	any luck with that?
2007-11-28T13:26:00.000Z	labinns1	MatthewV	found the exact thing you did but all files there are before my upgrade to Gutsy
2007-11-28T13:26:00.000Z	MatthewV	labinns1	so what does that file read then? you went to terminal, ran that command, and you should have seen then where they were being saved to ?
2007-11-28T13:28:00.000Z	labinns1	MatthewV	Out ${HOME}/PDF
2007-11-28T13:28:00.000Z	MatthewV	labinns1	please use pastebin if you wnat to paste a large amount of text...
2007-11-28T13:29:00.000Z	labinns1	MatthewV	Sorry, not familiar with paste bin, this is my first time using IRC
2007-11-28T13:29:00.000Z	MatthewV	labinns1	yeh thats ok.. just make sure you do next time :)
2007-11-28T13:30:00.000Z	labinns1	MatthewV	OK Thanks for trying
