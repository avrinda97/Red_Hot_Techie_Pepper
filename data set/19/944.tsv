2012-10-17T03:25:00.000Z	kristopher		i want my external display to stay as my main but i have to change it back after every reboot
2012-10-17T03:26:00.000Z	zykotick9	kristopher	save to your xorg.conf (if you have one).  what video card are you using ("lspci | grep -i vga" from terminal if unsure)?
2012-10-17T03:30:00.000Z	zykotick9	kristopher	in nvidia-settings use the "save settings" (or similar named) button
2012-10-17T03:31:00.000Z	kristopher	zykotick9	i do save it but i have to redo it after every reboot
2012-10-17T03:32:00.000Z	zykotick9	kristopher	sorry. i have no suggestion then. best of luck.
2012-10-17T03:33:00.000Z	zykotick9	kristopher	when you run/open nvidia-settings, does it ask for your sudo password?  if not, then try "gksudo nvidia-settings" make your changes, then use the save button.
2012-10-17T03:35:00.000Z	zykotick9	kristopher	"gksudo nvidia-settings"
2012-10-17T03:39:00.000Z	zykotick9	kristopher	did you click the "save to xorg" button?  if so, yes, reboot to test.
2012-10-17T03:40:00.000Z	zykotick9	kristopher	yes.
2012-10-17T03:42:00.000Z	zykotick9	kristopher	spam = 0 ;)  swap with 8GB+ memory could be fairly small, but you need some!
2012-10-17T03:42:00.000Z	zykotick9	kristopher	actionParsnip is correct
2012-10-17T03:46:00.000Z	zykotick9	kristopher	DON'T use sudo with GUI apps, use gksudo!!!
2012-10-17T03:46:00.000Z	zykotick9	kristopher	you can read "/msg ubottu gksudo" for deatils
2012-10-17T03:47:00.000Z	zykotick9	kristopher	SORRY!  nvidia-xonfig IS a terminal application!  my bad.
2012-10-17T03:49:00.000Z	zykotick9	kristopher	you might want to see "/msg ubottu paste" in your irc client
2012-10-17T04:10:00.000Z	kristopher	zykotick9	you were helping me right
2012-10-17T04:11:00.000Z	zykotick9	kristopher	"helping" is debatable ;)  the non-saving nvidia graphics [ i had to scroll back to remember ]
2012-10-17T04:11:00.000Z	zykotick9	kristopher	nice :)  well done
