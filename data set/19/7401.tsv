2010-01-01T14:27:00.000Z	unkmar		My adobe flash audio is broken.  Help?
2010-01-01T14:28:00.000Z	blackest_knight	unkmar	 have you rebooted ?
2010-01-01T14:28:00.000Z	unkmar	blackest_knight	I have to reboot?  crud.
2010-01-01T14:30:00.000Z	unkmar	blackest_knight	my audio works.  my flash audio does not.  My system had been rebooted many times since the original flash audio failure.  so if you were expecting the usual, reboot magic to work.  Not gonna work this time. :(
2010-01-01T14:30:00.000Z	blackest_knight	unkmar	 i'm not saying you can't get flash audio working again without rebooting but it does seem to restore it most of the time
2010-01-01T14:31:00.000Z	blackest_knight	unkmar	do you have vlc ?
2010-01-01T14:31:00.000Z	unkmar	blackest_knight	yes.
2010-01-01T14:31:00.000Z	unkmar	blackest_knight	and it plays audio just fine.
2010-01-01T14:32:00.000Z	unkmar	blackest_knight	I recently has decided to learn to program flash.  Downloaded the adobe flex stuff and went through some .deb installs and such.
2010-01-01T14:32:00.000Z	unkmar	blackest_knight	my flash audio stopped immediately after that.
2010-01-01T14:32:00.000Z	blackest_knight	unkmar	try this go to youtube and pick a video it will download it to /tmp copy it out of there and play it with vlc if you have audio its a firefox issue
2010-01-01T14:35:00.000Z	blackest_knight	unkmar	it usually is a firefox issue (although recently the flash installer tends to work you might have a couple of flash versions on your system now thou which might have upset things)
2010-01-01T14:36:00.000Z	unkmar	blackest_knight	I would love to cleanse it of ALL flash and then reinstall it.
2010-01-01T14:38:00.000Z	blackest_knight	unkmar	synaptic should be able to search for flash and make sure you use remove completely don't want a dodgy config file getting reused when you reinstall
2010-01-01T14:41:00.000Z	unkmar	blackest_knight	vlc was very unhappy with the swf I downloaded
2010-01-01T14:42:00.000Z	blackest_knight	unkmar	normally vlc can play the videos fine (great way to collect music via youtube ;))
2010-01-01T14:48:00.000Z	blackest_knight	unkmar	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1318171 might help you
2010-01-01T14:56:00.000Z	unkmar	blackest_knight	I tried the little script. and I am not going to remove my pulseaudio. it was working before. it can work again.
2010-01-01T15:01:00.000Z	blackest_knight	unkmar	/bin/sh -c "PULSE_SERVER=127.0.0.1 skype" allows me to use skype with alsa rather than pulseaudio  and leaves pulse installed
