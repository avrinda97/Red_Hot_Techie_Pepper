2008-10-05T23:55:00.000Z	geremy	sebastian	is your guest's resolution set high enough to occupy your whole screen?

2008-10-05T23:57:00.000Z	geremy	sebastian	no opengl, srry
2008-10-05T23:58:00.000Z	sebastian	geremy	ok so no effects will work?
2008-10-05T23:58:00.000Z	geremy	sebastian	if you want more eye candy, you may want to try something like e17 that uses 2d effects instead of 3d
2008-10-05T23:58:00.000Z	geremy	sebastian	no, sorry
2008-10-05T23:58:00.000Z	geremy	sebastian	bye
