2007-06-26T07:08:00.000Z	pha|con		type ls before you run the command so you can copy it from the filename
2007-06-26T07:09:00.000Z	pha|con		*whatever
2007-06-26T07:10:00.000Z	pha|con		<monty burns> Excellent </monty burns>
2007-06-26T07:11:00.000Z	pha|con		is the file there?
2007-06-26T07:12:00.000Z	pha|con		copy the name of the files exactly when you type the command in
2007-06-26T07:14:00.000Z	larson9999	pha|con	he really need to install from the binary?
2007-06-26T07:14:00.000Z	pha|con	larson9999	i'm assuming he wants the 3d
2007-06-26T07:14:00.000Z	pha|con	larson9999	 he says vesa works
2007-06-26T07:15:00.000Z	larson9999	pha|con	why not the packages, automatix, or the restricted modules dealie/
2007-06-26T07:15:00.000Z	pha|con	larson9999	i don't even use the ubuntu binary, i use the one from nvidia.com
2007-06-26T07:16:00.000Z	pha|con	larson9999	aside from automatix, the other two are one and the same....unless youre installing from nvidia's .run you have to have the restricted driver's package.  he has both.
2007-06-26T07:16:00.000Z	pha|con	larson9999	er, not one and the same, but linked
2007-06-26T07:17:00.000Z	pha|con	larson9999	something got really effed up somewhere, and he says it's a fresh install.  my only other advice would be to format and try again.
2007-06-26T07:18:00.000Z	larson9999	pha|con	just was curious why have a newb install outside the package manager... if there was a real reason.
2007-06-26T07:18:00.000Z	pha|con	larson9999	because there isn't anything difficult about typing sudo apt-get install packagename
2007-06-26T07:18:00.000Z	pha|con	larson9999	 if they've managed to get ubuntu installed they can do that
2007-06-26T07:19:00.000Z	larson9999	pha|con	i was talking about having him run nv*run.
2007-06-26T07:20:00.000Z	pha|con	larson9999	because the repo binaries weren't working.  and i wasn't having him run it i was having him extract files from it
2007-06-26T07:39:00.000Z	pha|con	larson9999	it's not automatix that breaks the machines it's how it installs the apps.
