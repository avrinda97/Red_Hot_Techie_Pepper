2005-12-18T06:23:00.000Z	fireside	aftertaf	what is me chattin on here bothering u
2005-12-18T06:27:00.000Z	aftertaf	fireside	 this is not a social chat channel this is a support channel, people here ask help and others try to reply, but when people take up space by chatting, despite the fact they have been asked not to, is very irrespectful and will earn you a ban as soon as an op gets online. i can guarantee this to you; so you could as well say goodbye now.
2005-12-18T06:27:00.000Z	aftertaf	fireside	 like i said you can take it to #ubuntu-offtopic and there is NO problem, the fact you refuse to is point enough.
2005-12-18T06:28:00.000Z	aftertaf	fireside	type /join #ubuntu-offtopic and do the support channel a favour
2005-12-18T06:30:00.000Z	aftertaf	fireside	were you born completely stupid?
2005-12-18T06:31:00.000Z	fireside	aftertaf	wiv a name like that u were born completly stupid
2005-12-18T06:31:00.000Z	aftertaf	fireside	 how kindergarten
2005-12-18T06:35:00.000Z	aftertaf	fireside	 assuming you are 1) able to read more than 3 words that arent in l33t sp3ak shordh4nd, 2) are capable of actually clicking a link and using a web browser.... read this. https://launchpad.net/codeofconduct/1.0 applies here
