2008-11-29T13:55:00.000Z	WIGGMPk		I have a second hard drive and plan to just use it for Virtual Machines.. should I just make it Extended ??
2008-11-29T13:55:00.000Z	iarwain1	WIGGMPk	you don't make a hard drive extended. You make partitions extended. And no, it doesn't really matter (just remember, only 4 primary partitions allowed per hard drive)
2008-11-29T13:56:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	iarwain1	its not going to boot.. just used as a slave for vm's..
2008-11-29T13:57:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	iarwain1	and you can create a new partition as Primary or Extended.. which is preferred in my situation??
2008-11-29T13:57:00.000Z	iarwain1	WIGGMPk	doesn't matter, you can't make a harddrive extended. Partitions, yes
2008-11-29T13:57:00.000Z	iarwain1	WIGGMPk	doesn't matter :D
2008-11-29T13:58:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	iarwain1	im not trying to make the 'harddrive' extended
2008-11-29T13:58:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	iarwain1	im asking what type of partition should I FORMAT this harddrive with.. if its a slave, being used for just virtual machines and not an OS...
2008-11-29T13:58:00.000Z	iarwain1	WIGGMPk	oh, ext3 is fine for almost everything
2008-11-29T13:59:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	iarwain1	what TYPE OF PARTITION.. if you said "Primary" i would use the ext3 filesystem.. but your not answering what im asking
2008-11-29T13:59:00.000Z	iarwain1	WIGGMPk	because you can't ask decent questions?
2008-11-29T14:00:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	iarwain1	*sigh* in an effort to stir this into something useful.. can you explain the differences between Primary vs Extended partitions as it pretains to my situation???
2008-11-29T14:01:00.000Z	iarwain1	WIGGMPk	if you're using it for just data, it doesn't matter if you use primary or extended partitions. there is no "real" difference except that you can only have up to 4 primary partitions, and unlimited (as long as you have the space) extended partitions
2008-11-29T14:01:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	iarwain1	thank you.. much appreciated..
2008-11-29T14:02:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	iarwain1	that was serious.. i am much appreciated.. however the google'ing stuff was sarcastic and childish hehehe
2008-11-29T14:03:00.000Z	iarwain1	WIGGMPk	i need to work on my skillz to detect that =D
2008-11-29T14:03:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	iarwain1	im uber 3l33t via text
