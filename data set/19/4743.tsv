2008-11-12T03:17:00.000Z	troal011		Is apt-get really slow for anyone else?
2008-11-12T03:18:00.000Z	iguardian	troal011	what point is it slow?
2008-11-12T03:19:00.000Z	troal011	iguardian	downloading packages, get speeds between 2-30kb/s
2008-11-12T03:22:00.000Z	troal011	iguardian	SOmetimes it also just stops downloading
2008-11-12T03:23:00.000Z	iguardian	troal011	open terminal, and type sudo apt-get update --fix-missing tell me if it sticks on that bit
2008-11-12T03:24:00.000Z	troal011	iguardian	No that works... I'm on a laptop with a bcm4328 wireless running on the wl driver
2008-11-12T03:25:00.000Z	iguardian	troal011	is the problem when you have tried to install, say "sudo apt-get install alien" for example
2008-11-12T03:26:00.000Z	troal011	iguardian	Yes
2008-11-12T03:27:00.000Z	iguardian	troal011	may i ask what you are trying to install?
2008-11-12T03:28:00.000Z	troal011	iguardian	First tried to do an apt-get upgrade, it was slooow, then I tried apt-get install wine, same thing
2008-11-12T03:28:00.000Z	troal011	iguardian	Just wondering if it could be my wireless that's the issue
2008-11-12T03:29:00.000Z	iguardian	troal011	yes, its probably that if you gave me name of item your are trying to install, I can have a look
2008-11-12T03:30:00.000Z	iguardian	troal011	also are you pulling wine from the wine website, or just from default ubuntu packages?
2008-11-12T03:31:00.000Z	troal011	iguardian	Tried from ubuntu first, then I added the winehq repos
2008-11-12T03:33:00.000Z	troal011	iguardian	I'm at home and the signal is 80% and better
2008-11-12T03:35:00.000Z	troal011	iguardian	Doing a speedtest.net test I'm achieving close to my max speed
2008-11-12T03:35:00.000Z	iguardian	troal011	ok, maybe restart, set it going and leave it a while, have heard of it sticking a bit on a slow connection, and then kicking in, try waiting half hour or so. Unless you have tried this before?
2008-11-12T03:36:00.000Z	troal011	iguardian	No I'm just used to fedora/yum with fastest-mirror plugin :)
2008-11-12T03:36:00.000Z	troal011	iguardian	Usually got DL speeds at 800kb/s there
