2011-06-17T09:06:00.000Z	tripelb		and TheLifelessOne it's a good idea because if it doesnt work you still have the working debian partition to use.
2011-06-17T09:07:00.000Z	tripelb		ah I see the lifelessone, older comuter than my 2004 one.  Then have someone else make you a liveCD
2011-06-17T09:08:00.000Z	tripelb		ah I see the lifelessone, older comuter than my 2004 one.  Then have someone else make you a liveCD  TheLifelessOne
2011-06-17T09:08:00.000Z	TheLifelessOne	tripelb	'tis a very old computer.
2011-06-17T09:05:00.000Z	tripelb	TheLifelessOne	I'm no expert but you cant do that. You have to install ubuntu on it's own partition.
2011-06-17T09:05:00.000Z	TheLifelessOne	tripelb	really? :/
2011-06-17T09:06:00.000Z	tripelb	TheLifelessOne	YOu cant even go from ubuntu to ubuntu without doing it one udate at a time.
2011-06-17T09:06:00.000Z	tripelb	TheLifelessOne	you can do it on a usb flash drive
2011-06-17T09:07:00.000Z	TheLifelessOne	tripelb	BIOS doesn't support that. :/
2011-06-17T09:07:00.000Z	tripelb	TheLifelessOne	please use my nick in every line when you are talking to me.
2011-06-17T09:07:00.000Z	tripelb	TheLifelessOne	ty
2011-06-17T09:07:00.000Z	TheLifelessOne	tripelb	sorry. :/
2011-06-17T09:09:00.000Z	tripelb	TheLifelessOne	I cant understand what escott said. sHe's a better source. I hand you over... HEH
2011-06-17T09:10:00.000Z	TheLifelessOne	tripelb	all my data is backed up.
2011-06-17T09:11:00.000Z	tripelb	TheLifelessOne	ah so escott has an answer better than asking for a liveCD (triplelb remembers this)
