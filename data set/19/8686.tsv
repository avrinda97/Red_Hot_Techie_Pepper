2007-02-26T10:41:00.000Z	kalorin		ok, now I'm >< close to going back to XP
2007-02-26T10:41:00.000Z	kalorin		wine will not run photoshop
2007-02-26T10:42:00.000Z	kalorin		and I can't for the life of me get vmware to run
2007-02-26T10:42:00.000Z	kalorin		yahoo messenger, media monkey
2007-02-26T10:42:00.000Z	kalorin		there's just too many things that don't run under linux at this point
2007-02-26T10:43:00.000Z	kalorin		and i figured I'd just vmware a windows instance and have them if I needed them until I found replacements
2007-02-26T10:43:00.000Z	kalorin		but I can't afford the time to try to figure that out
2007-02-26T10:43:00.000Z	kalorin		I haven't tried gaim
2007-02-26T10:43:00.000Z	bruenig	kalorin	well don't complain, if you need some alternatives, ask but don't complain
2007-02-26T10:44:00.000Z	kalorin	bruenig	I totally understand but I've literally spent 2 days trying to et vmware running
2007-02-26T10:44:00.000Z	bruenig	kalorin	some quick google searches and you probably could have found better alternatives, what programs do you need
2007-02-26T10:45:00.000Z	kalorin	bruenig	to buy time to find a good alternative
2007-02-26T10:46:00.000Z	bruenig	kalorin	sudo apt-get install exifprobe
2007-02-26T10:48:00.000Z	bruenig	kalorin	do the following: sudo sed 's/# deb/deb/g' -i /etc/apt/sources.list && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install exifprobe
2007-02-26T10:51:00.000Z	bruenig	kalorin	run the command, it enables that universe repository so you can get that program
2007-02-26T10:52:00.000Z	bruenig	kalorin	you should probably enable the multiverse repository too
2007-02-26T10:54:00.000Z	bruenig	kalorin	well in command: echo "deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ edgy multiverse" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list
2007-02-26T10:54:00.000Z	bruenig	kalorin	commands are easier
2007-02-26T10:55:00.000Z	bruenig	kalorin	well if you just copy and paste something, that is easier than me trying to explain how to do it in synaptic, with the click this and then click this and so forth and so on. Also I don't know synaptic having never used it
