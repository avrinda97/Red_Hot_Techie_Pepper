2007-05-28T05:57:00.000Z	Dev05	FFighter	Did you read the link I sent you???
2007-05-28T05:57:00.000Z	FFighter	Dev05	Sorry, I haven't seen it

2007-05-28T05:57:00.000Z	FFighter	Dev05	Thanks, I will take a look
2007-05-28T05:58:00.000Z	Dev05	FFighter	You'll need 2 network card in your Linux box, that's for sure.
2007-05-28T05:59:00.000Z	FFighter	Dev05	I had already tried this one... the difference here is that I've got an USB mode, so a bridge (nas0 ?) is created and things get more complex
2007-05-28T05:59:00.000Z	FFighter	Dev05	I could paste the ifconfig output if that helps to figure it out
2007-05-28T06:00:00.000Z	Dev05	FFighter	Wouldn't it work anyway? Looks simple...
2007-05-28T06:01:00.000Z	FFighter	Dev05	I've tried it many times and I can't manage to get the XP box to ping my Ubuntu box
2007-05-28T06:01:00.000Z	FFighter	Dev05	I don't know what else to do, I really need some help...
2007-05-28T06:01:00.000Z	Dev05	FFighter	I have to say that I've tried this before and I couldn't get it to work. Now, I've never tried that post... Hold on.
2007-05-28T06:02:00.000Z	FFighter	Dev05	Ok, no hurry
2007-05-28T06:03:00.000Z	Dev05	FFighter	Could we go in a private conversation (there's too much "noise" to follow a conversation in this channel) :) ?
2007-05-28T06:04:00.000Z	FFighter	Dev05	Of course
2007-05-28T06:04:00.000Z	FFighter	Dev05	Pardon my ignorance, but how to engage on a private conversation on LostIRC (I've only used mIRC so far)
