2012-09-08T21:58:00.000Z	trupheenix	mutio	no chance :(
2012-09-08T22:21:00.000Z	mutio	trupheenix	// are you assigning addresses by dhcp?
2012-09-08T22:22:00.000Z	trupheenix	mutio	the ip addresses get assigned by dhcp
2012-09-08T22:23:00.000Z	trupheenix	mutio	the wifi hotspot itself creates a range starting with 10.42.43. something
2012-09-08T22:23:00.000Z	trupheenix	mutio	 i want it to assign as 192.168.43 .something
2012-09-08T22:24:00.000Z	mutio	trupheenix	// does it really matter? 10.x is a bigger subnet.
2012-09-08T22:25:00.000Z	trupheenix	mutio	thing is i am doing some development and i have a dns running on my laptop. i plan to use my laptop hotspot when there is a power cut.
2012-09-08T22:25:00.000Z	trupheenix	mutio	so i want the laptop hotspot to use everything in the exact same way as my router is configured to use.
2012-09-08T22:26:00.000Z	mutio	trupheenix	// why not change the router to 10.x? it's a bigger subnet
2012-09-08T22:27:00.000Z	trupheenix	mutio	sound plausible to me
2012-09-08T22:27:00.000Z	trupheenix	mutio	but then the problem still remains! :(
2012-09-08T22:28:00.000Z	trupheenix	mutio	i should be able to configure the ip address of my wifi hotspot so that the dns ip remains same. that way i don't have to change all the dns records.
2012-09-08T22:29:00.000Z	trupheenix	mutio	looks like i will be needing to configure avahi?
2012-09-08T22:29:00.000Z	mutio	trupheenix	// don't know, I can't run servers visible to the external internet. my isp are meanies
2012-09-08T22:30:00.000Z	trupheenix	mutio	why not? u can always get a static ip?
2012-09-08T22:31:00.000Z	mutio	trupheenix	// my mean isp doesn't let any incoming connections to servers, even with a dynamic dns service. they say it's against their TOS
2012-09-08T22:32:00.000Z	trupheenix	mutio	oh you should look at one of those SME /SOHO type connections. they allow on those.
2012-09-08T22:32:00.000Z	mutio	trupheenix	// they simpy block any incoming traffic that wasn't initiated with outgoing traffic
