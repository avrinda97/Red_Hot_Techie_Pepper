2009-06-29T03:04:00.000Z	sillyCEO		Quick question for any Eeebuntu users out there...
2009-06-29T03:06:00.000Z	mdg	sillyCEO	jump right in
2009-06-29T03:06:00.000Z	sillyCEO	mdg	Thanx- Q: Do I always have to give my password to jump on my Wifi?
2009-06-29T03:07:00.000Z	mdg	sillyCEO	you should be able to set it up so you don't have to
2009-06-29T03:08:00.000Z	sillyCEO	mdg	Whatever comes with eeebuntu- I think 'network manager'
2009-06-29T03:08:00.000Z	mdg	sillyCEO	I don't have an eeepc ... yet,
2009-06-29T03:09:00.000Z	sillyCEO	mdg	I love it. Really.
2009-06-29T03:09:00.000Z	sillyCEO	mdg	this is the only issue- which is pretty amazing if you think about it!
2009-06-29T03:09:00.000Z	mdg	sillyCEO	I hear a lot of people say they love them.
2009-06-29T03:09:00.000Z	sillyCEO	mdg	It was $180.     $180!!!!!!!!
2009-06-29T03:10:00.000Z	mdg	sillyCEO	whas it an 1000ha?
2009-06-29T03:11:00.000Z	sillyCEO	mdg	A 900A. They go for under $200 new, all the time. And work great- camera, USB, SD card, Wifi, etc.
2009-06-29T03:11:00.000Z	sillyCEO	mdg	 But there is something called "keyring" that stores passwords, and I think its a little.... tempermental.
2009-06-29T03:11:00.000Z	mdg	sillyCEO	yes - the keyring thing throws me too
2009-06-29T03:12:00.000Z	mdg	sillyCEO	you have a main keyring password, then one for wifi
2009-06-29T03:12:00.000Z	sillyCEO	mdg	So thats in the regular ubuntu too? (I'm in Eeebuntu)
2009-06-29T03:12:00.000Z	sillyCEO	mdg	that's what I figured - but it seems like the keyring isn't persistant. Or something. Because it still asks me for password all the time.
2009-06-29T03:13:00.000Z	sillyCEO	mdg	I'll poke around and try to figure out wassup with keyring. Thx for yer time....
2009-06-29T03:14:00.000Z	mdg	sillyCEO	your welcome :)
