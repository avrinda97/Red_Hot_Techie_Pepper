2008-03-11T04:22:00.000Z	Pelo	gribouille	OOo works in ubuntu for me right from the install
2008-03-11T04:23:00.000Z	gribouille	Pelo	I downloaded the source package of OOo on ubuntu and it includes a 4 million line patch
2008-03-11T04:24:00.000Z	Pelo	gribouille	you tried instaling 2.3 %
2008-03-11T04:24:00.000Z	gribouille	Pelo	yes
2008-03-11T04:25:00.000Z	Pelo	gribouille	well that's wath you get then you want bleeding edge ,  precompiled packages for ubuntu work right out
2008-03-11T04:25:00.000Z	gribouille	Pelo	that's not blleeding edge, that's the normal OOo package
2008-03-11T04:26:00.000Z	Pelo	gribouille	isn'T 2.2 the current one in ubuntu ? in anycase youc an install OOo from the repos , don't know why you would go and get the source
2008-03-11T04:27:00.000Z	gribouille	Pelo	because the OOo package for ubuntu is completely broken
2008-03-11T04:27:00.000Z	Pelo	gribouille	first I 've heard of it
2008-03-11T04:28:00.000Z	gribouille	Pelo	writer has a lot of bugs on ubuntu
