2008-11-17T05:08:00.000Z	lugnut64		I am having trouble with the liveCD can someone help me - When I start the computer with the live cd, the splash screen appears, but the GUI never appears and i am left at a safe graphics mode with only a termanal
2008-11-17T05:08:00.000Z	jordanv	lugnut64	you may have a corrupted disk
2008-11-17T05:08:00.000Z	jordanv		try burning slower
2008-11-17T05:08:00.000Z	lugnut64		no, it worked in a virtural machine
2008-11-17T05:09:00.000Z	lugnut64		i checked the cd for errors, no problems
2008-11-17T05:11:00.000Z	lugnut64	jordanv	the disk worked for a virtual machine and i checked the cd for defects, there are no problems on the cd
2008-11-17T05:11:00.000Z	jordanv	lugnut64	try alternative?
2008-11-17T05:12:00.000Z	lugnut64	jordanv	i am worried that when installing the alternate cd would have the same problem. i have a gforce 7000m nforce 610 graphics card and gpu
2008-11-17T05:13:00.000Z	jordanv	lugnut64	try it and see how it goes
2008-11-17T05:14:00.000Z	lugnut64	jordanv	i will, just one problem, i wanted to test it out without installing because i am worried about screwing up my *sigh* vista partion and i don't have an installation disk
2008-11-17T05:15:00.000Z	jordanv	lugnut64	if you REALLY want to try it and the livecd doesnt work, you can make a small partition using vista's partitioner
2008-11-17T05:17:00.000Z	lugnut64	jordanv	i know that, the windows boot loader (on my now broken desktop) never picked up on the ubuntu, and i would actually like to keep the windows bootloader.
2008-11-17T05:17:00.000Z	jordanv	lugnut64	google Wubi
2008-11-17T05:17:00.000Z	lugnut64	jordanv	oh, and wubi never worked
2008-11-17T05:18:00.000Z	jordanv	lugnut64	install it in the virtual machine?
2008-11-17T05:18:00.000Z	lugnut64	jordanv	the windows bootloader never picked it up
2008-11-17T05:18:00.000Z	lugnut64	jordanv	i did (to test it out)
2008-11-17T05:18:00.000Z	lugnut64	jordanv	you can help someone else for now, i can wait
2008-11-17T05:19:00.000Z	lugnut64	jordanv	i am downloading the alternate install disk
