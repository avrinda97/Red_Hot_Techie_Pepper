2011-09-14T04:58:00.000Z	sn0rlax	hcook	I am glad to hear that, I hear the ubuntu is quite stable so thats why i decided to try it out. :)
2011-09-14T04:59:00.000Z	hcook		brb; gonna reboot on the theory that i don't know when i did it last and maybe there's been a kernel update since then that's messing with syslinux running and causing it to hang. otherwise kinda outa ideas.
2011-09-14T05:13:00.000Z	sn0rlax	hcook	how is the default security with lamp install, any idea?
