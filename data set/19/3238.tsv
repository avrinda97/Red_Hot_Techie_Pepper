2009-09-24T10:38:00.000Z	ubu_nub		xgates: did you export the correct gcc?
2009-09-24T10:38:00.000Z	Xgates	ubu_nub	sorry what ya mean export?
2009-09-24T10:39:00.000Z	ubu_nub		xgates: do you have gcc 4.3 installed?
2009-09-24T10:39:00.000Z	Xgates	ubu_nub	I have whatever Ubuntu installs by default
2009-09-24T10:39:00.000Z	Xgates		I believe that's 4.3
2009-09-24T10:39:00.000Z	ubu_nub		export CC=gcc-4.3
2009-09-24T10:40:00.000Z	Xgates	ubu_nub	I made a typo before it says --->  The compiler used to compile the kernel (gcc-4.2) does not exactly match the current compiler (gcc-4.3)....
2009-09-24T10:40:00.000Z	ubu_nub		xgates there is probably a better way but try: dpkg -S gcc
2009-09-24T10:41:00.000Z	Xgates	ubu_nub	so still run export?
2009-09-24T10:41:00.000Z	Xgates		k
2009-09-24T10:41:00.000Z	ubu_nub		if you have 4.3 already use that export command. if not install it.
2009-09-24T10:44:00.000Z	Xgates	ubu_nub	dpkg -S gcc shows all the beginning lines as gcc-4.3
2009-09-24T10:45:00.000Z	Xgates	ubu_nub	why are we concentrating on gcc-4.3, it says the kernel was compiled with 4.2, so I thought I need to have 4.2 installed for the Nvidia drivers?
2009-09-24T10:45:00.000Z	ubu_nub		xgates: doh. is there a gcc-4.2 available?
2009-09-24T10:46:00.000Z	Xgates		I didn't see any in synaptic but if I want to install it, would I run ---> apt-get gcc-4.2 install? maybe from the cli will work?
2009-09-24T10:47:00.000Z	ubu_nub	Xgates	apt-cache search gcc-4.2
2009-09-24T10:47:00.000Z	Xgates		k
2009-09-24T11:00:00.000Z	Xgates	ubu_nub	export didn't help but I figured out to run the installer like this --->  export CC=gcc-4.3 ./NVIDIA-Linux-x86-177.82-pkg1.run
2009-09-24T11:03:00.000Z	ubu_nub	Xgates	nice. did it give any errors about symbolic links?
