2010-05-11T01:24:00.000Z	Mopeyennui		... I guess i'm fucked for getting my bookmarks back, eh?
2010-05-11T01:25:00.000Z	Mopeyennui		How do I get into to a locked folder?
2010-05-11T01:26:00.000Z	Mopeyennui		Okay.. I'm using a Live CD because I screwed the HDD up. I'm looking around the HDD and getting stuff before I reinstall.. but I have a problem, I can't get into the Mozilla folder to get the bookmarks.
2010-05-11T01:26:00.000Z	Mopeyennui		How can I get into the locked folder (I was root, so I can login in, but.. how do I log in to get at locked forlder?)
2010-05-11T01:27:00.000Z	Mopeyennui		.wine I hope.
2010-05-11T01:27:00.000Z	Mopeyennui		(It's under your user dir.
2010-05-11T01:27:00.000Z	yondering	Mopeyennui	the bookmarks.html file will be under ~/.mozilla - it's a hidden folder, you need to show hidden in the file browser, or use cd .mozilla (with the period before the directory name) in a terminal.
2010-05-11T01:28:00.000Z	Mopeyennui	yondering	I can see the folder... I can't open it (permissions problem). How do I correct this?
2010-05-11T01:32:00.000Z	yondering	Mopeyennui	open a terminal window, cd to your home directory, and chmod -R 0666 .mozilla
2010-05-11T01:32:00.000Z	yondering	Mopeyennui	sorry, you'll need to use 'sudo chmod -R 0666 .mozilla
2010-05-11T01:36:00.000Z	yondering	Mopeyennui	hrm do ls -a | grep mozilla in your home dir on the hdd
2010-05-11T01:42:00.000Z	Mopeyennui	yondering	isn't there a way to get into a folder using the default file browser on ubuntu?
2010-05-11T01:44:00.000Z	yondering	Mopeyennui	probably.  But I'm showing you the simplest way I know to change the file permissions.  Make sure you're in the proper directory, and use the command I gave you earlier. =/
2010-05-11T01:54:00.000Z	yondering	Mopeyennui	sorry =/   pwd shows you the current directory in the terminal window.  if that's not pointing to your home directory on the hdd, the rest won't work.  That's all I can suggest I'm afraid.
2010-05-11T01:55:00.000Z	yondering	Mopeyennui	perhaps somebody else here knows more about nautilus and permissions than I do.. I don't use gnome.
2010-05-11T01:59:00.000Z	yondering	Mopeyennui	as they said - you need to open nautilus using gksudo and change the permissions in that folder from that nautilus window.
2010-05-11T01:59:00.000Z	yondering	Mopeyennui	or just use that window to pull your bookmarks.html out.
2010-05-11T02:03:00.000Z	yondering	Mopeyennui	if you created a separate partition for /home, and you do not format the /home partition when you reinstall, it will not.
2010-05-11T02:05:00.000Z	yondering	Mopeyennui	use 'gksudo nautilus' when you're running from that livecd.  You should be able to browse to the directory and retrieve your bookmarks.html using that nautilus window.  =/
