2011-10-27T05:52:00.000Z	zyltoid_		i have the ew-7722in wireless card. it seems to be detected but it just says 'not connected'. anyone know what may be wrong?
2011-10-27T05:53:00.000Z	slimjimflim	zyltoid_	can you see it with lspci ?
2011-10-27T05:53:00.000Z	zyltoid_	slimjimflim	yeah, shows up as 'network controller: Ralink corp.'
2011-10-27T05:54:00.000Z	slimjimflim	zyltoid_	ok that's good.  do you have iwconfig installed?
2011-10-27T05:55:00.000Z	slimjimflim	zyltoid_	good again ;)
2011-10-27T05:57:00.000Z	slimjimflim	zyltoid_	do you have an antenna?
2011-10-27T05:57:00.000Z	zyltoid_	slimjimflim	yeah, it has 2 antennas. it's a desktop pci btw
2011-10-27T05:57:00.000Z	slimjimflim	zyltoid_	can you see access points from any other computers in the same area?
2011-10-27T06:02:00.000Z	zyltoid_	slimjimflim	no unfortunately, which is the problem :(
2011-10-27T06:02:00.000Z	slimjimflim	zyltoid_	well it looks like your drivers and software are setup correctly
2011-10-27T06:03:00.000Z	slimjimflim	zyltoid_	the next thing i'd do would be try running it somewhere that you know has a wireless connection
2011-10-27T06:03:00.000Z	zyltoid_	slimjimflim	i know i have a wireless connect, i use the same card on windows OOB
2011-10-27T06:03:00.000Z	slimjimflim	zyltoid_	you could also try: cat /var/log|grep <your card name or wlan0 or something>
2011-10-27T06:03:00.000Z	zyltoid_	slimjimflim	here's pastebin http://pastebin.com/KVbPq9tQ
2011-10-27T06:05:00.000Z	slimjimflim	zyltoid_	yea it looks like you just don't have any access points available on the air
2011-10-27T06:05:00.000Z	slimjimflim	zyltoid_	what kind of card is it? b/g/n?

2011-10-27T06:10:00.000Z	slimjimflim	zyltoid_	worth a try
2011-10-27T06:11:00.000Z	slimjimflim	zyltoid_	sometimes the newest version isn't the most stable
