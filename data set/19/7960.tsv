2007-06-06T13:37:00.000Z	PurpZeY		 KaKaRoTo: It seems that hibernate and suspend don't always work too well in Ubuntu.
2007-06-06T13:37:00.000Z	KaKaRoTo	PurpZeY	well, I did add the sound modules to /etc/apci/suspend.d/70-modules-unload .. but it's not working even after a full shutdown
2007-06-06T13:38:00.000Z	KaKaRoTo	PurpZeY	capitalidea btw,  kernel 2.6.20-15-generic
2007-06-06T13:38:00.000Z	PurpZeY	KaKaRoTo	What is not working now?
2007-06-06T13:38:00.000Z	KaKaRoTo	PurpZeY	no sound outputed
2007-06-06T13:38:00.000Z	PurpZeY	KaKaRoTo	Did you check alsa?
2007-06-06T13:38:00.000Z	KaKaRoTo	PurpZeY	modules load correctly, alsamixer works, everything seems normal, but when I play something, I hear nothing
2007-06-06T13:38:00.000Z	PurpZeY	KaKaRoTo	Did you check alsa?

2007-06-06T13:39:00.000Z	PurpZeY	KaKaRoTo	Make sure alsa mixer is output device See below
2007-06-06T13:42:00.000Z	PurpZeY	KaKaRoTo	Did you see the steps ubotu supplied, did you look at that?
2007-06-06T13:43:00.000Z	KaKaRoTo	PurpZeY	yeah, alsa mixer is selected
2007-06-06T13:43:00.000Z	KaKaRoTo	PurpZeY	but I don't think that's the problem.. I use aplay on wav files
2007-06-06T13:44:00.000Z	KaKaRoTo	PurpZeY	also, it works sometimes, and sometimes it doesn't, so it's a total mystery..
2007-06-06T13:44:00.000Z	PurpZeY	KaKaRoTo	Try opening alsamixer and make sure everything is max, and also that if you need amplification it's on.
2007-06-06T13:45:00.000Z	KaKaRoTo	PurpZeY	it's already checked, and everything is already maxed out
2007-06-06T13:45:00.000Z	KaKaRoTo	PurpZeY	last time, crimsun said it was a codec issue not being intialized, so I added probe_mask=3 to the snd-hda-intel module loading options, and it worked, but now, even this trick doesn't seem to work
2007-06-06T13:46:00.000Z	PurpZeY	KaKaRoTo	 If that is the case, this problem might be beyond my ability to solve.
2007-06-06T13:46:00.000Z	KaKaRoTo	PurpZeY	ok, thanks anyway for trying
