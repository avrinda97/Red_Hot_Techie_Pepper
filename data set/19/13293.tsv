2005-05-29T09:42:00.000Z	hondje		I like the mozilla mplayer plugin, that's awesome
2005-05-29T09:43:00.000Z	hondje		much better than fucking with plugger for hours X-(
2005-05-29T09:43:00.000Z	hondje		I always assumed it was just me
2005-05-29T09:43:00.000Z	hondje		I monitored it, and when it's loading pages the gui parts just die until it's done...
2005-05-29T09:43:00.000Z	hondje		or worse, when it has to load up java
2005-05-29T09:44:00.000Z	hondje		I did the speed up ones in the ubuntu handbook
2005-05-29T09:44:00.000Z	hondje		er, sudo apt-get remove --purge gcc
2005-05-29T09:46:00.000Z	hondje		hrm, I wonder why it does that to me
2005-05-29T09:46:00.000Z	hondje		It's not so terrible i can't stand it, but it sucks when I'm trying to get my pron-browse on and I have 20 tabs open

2005-05-29T09:47:00.000Z	hondje	LinuxJones	I haven't noticed it being tied into DNS, but I haven't looked much
