2008-07-23T06:36:00.000Z	evon		how to I build flash from source?
2008-07-23T06:36:00.000Z	evon		I have no idea
2008-07-23T06:36:00.000Z	evon		i've downloaded the tar file already and unzipped
2008-07-23T06:37:00.000Z	evon		just don' know what to do from there
2008-07-23T06:38:00.000Z	kindofabuzz	evon	just copy the new libflashplayer.so to  /usr/lib/flashplugin-nonfree
2008-07-23T06:38:00.000Z	kindofabuzz	evon	that's if you've installed the one from repos already
2008-07-23T06:39:00.000Z	kindofabuzz	evon	 sudo cp /whereverflash10is/libflashplayer.so /usr/lib/flashplugin-nonfree
2008-07-23T06:41:00.000Z	evon		i need to build it from source because i have an AMD64
2008-07-23T06:41:00.000Z	evon		flash movies work so far but not games
2008-07-23T06:44:00.000Z	evon	kindofabuzz	 i need to build it from source because i have an AMD64
2008-07-23T06:46:00.000Z	kindofabuzz	evon	then you build it just like you'd build anything else, when in doubt, read the README or INSTALL, should be in with the source
2008-07-23T06:47:00.000Z	evon	kindofabuzz	i've looked for those files and couldn't find them
2008-07-23T06:47:00.000Z	kindofabuzz	evon	should be in the same folder of the source, did you unpack the source yet?
2008-07-23T06:47:00.000Z	evon	kindofabuzz	i'm very new to linux so i still don't know how to build anything from source
2008-07-23T06:48:00.000Z	evon	kindofabuzz	yes i unpacked it
2008-07-23T06:48:00.000Z	kindofabuzz	evon	send me the link to what you d/l'd
