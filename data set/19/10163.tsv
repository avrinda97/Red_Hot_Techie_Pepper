2006-07-20T11:40:00.000Z	shak_		are there any gtk supported linux irc clients that can open .mrc script files (mirc remote scripts)
2006-07-20T11:41:00.000Z	shak_		im having to run wine to use em right now
2006-07-20T11:41:00.000Z	hawkaloogie	shak_	none, mirc script files are stupid. use xchat, you can find alternatives for most of what mirc scripts do (and a lot of them are build right into the client)
2006-07-20T11:42:00.000Z	shak_	hawkaloogie	its just that.. xhcat doesnt look as powerful? :/
2006-07-20T11:43:00.000Z	hawkaloogie	shak_	you can use Perl or Python or Tcl to script Xchat... what do you mean "doesn't look as powerful?"
2006-07-20T11:43:00.000Z	shak_	hawkaloogie	the interface must be deceiving me then, how do I plugin external scripts?
2006-07-20T11:44:00.000Z	hawkaloogie	shak_	Window > Plugins and Scripts...
2006-07-20T11:44:00.000Z	shak_	hawkaloogie	I dont see it
2006-07-20T11:46:00.000Z	hawkaloogie	shak_	#xchat would be a better place for your problem
2006-07-20T11:46:00.000Z	shak_	hawkaloogie	I just dont see a "window" you are talking about the menu bar right?
2006-07-20T11:47:00.000Z	hawkaloogie	shak_	yes, #xchat would know where it is on your version. I do not.
2006-07-20T11:47:00.000Z	shak_	hawkaloogie	k
2006-07-20T11:53:00.000Z	shak_	hawkaloogie	is it possible to automatically log all chat/query sessions?
2006-07-20T11:53:00.000Z	hawkaloogie	shak_	it's in the Settings > Preferences, it's just off by default
2006-07-20T11:54:00.000Z	shak_	hawkaloogie	wow what version are you using? I just have an Edit -> Preferences, and theres no log saving there
2006-07-20T11:55:00.000Z	hawkaloogie	shak_	i'm using the latest version, 2.6.4, compiled myself, maybe that's why
2006-07-20T11:56:00.000Z	shak_	hawkaloogie	hmm.... xchat gnome 0.11..
2006-07-20T11:56:00.000Z	hawkaloogie	shak_	bad idea, just get normal xchat
2006-07-20T11:57:00.000Z	shak_	hawkaloogie	yep, downloading now
