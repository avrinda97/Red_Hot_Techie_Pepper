2010-09-19T11:27:00.000Z	monokrome		Hey. If I need to migrate files from an old install from my encrypted home directory, will I be able to access the "Public" directory from in the mount on the other machine?
2010-09-19T11:28:00.000Z	icarus-c	monokrome	you can access the whole file system
2010-09-19T11:29:00.000Z	monokrome	icarus-c	I am asking if the Public directory in my encrypted home directory is accessible without needing to use my encryption passphrase (which I don't know)
2010-09-19T11:29:00.000Z	icarus-c	monokrome	NO
2010-09-19T11:30:00.000Z	icarus-c	monokrome	you tell me..
2010-09-19T11:30:00.000Z	icarus-c	monokrome	you just asked "how can i get my password for e-banking"
2010-09-19T11:31:00.000Z	monokrome	icarus-c	No I didn't, because I'm already on the system that I want the passphrase for.
2010-09-19T11:31:00.000Z	icarus-c	monokrome	that means you know the passphase ?
2010-09-19T11:31:00.000Z	monokrome	icarus-c	No, because I need the encryptfs phrase not my user password.
2010-09-19T11:34:00.000Z	icarus-c	monokrome	you don't get it... passphrase is the password used for encrypt your home directory
2010-09-19T11:34:00.000Z	monokrome	icarus-c	I know. There's a way to get it if you're in the folder.
2010-09-19T11:35:00.000Z	icarus-c	monokrome	no.  but you should have entered the passphrase on boot in order to mount it in the first place
2010-09-19T11:35:00.000Z	monokrome	icarus-c	You don't get it.
2010-09-19T11:36:00.000Z	icarus-c	monokrome	don't you know the passphrase for that partition?...
2010-09-19T11:38:00.000Z	icarus-c	monokrome	ecryptfs-unwrap-passphrase ?
2010-09-19T11:38:00.000Z	icarus-c	monokrome	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EncryptedPrivateDirectory
2010-09-19T11:39:00.000Z	monokrome	icarus-c	That did it.
2010-09-19T11:39:00.000Z	icarus-c	monokrome	i google  ubuntu get passphrase
2010-09-19T11:39:00.000Z	monokrome	icarus-c	see my last comment
