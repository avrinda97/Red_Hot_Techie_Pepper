2005-12-02T13:21:00.000Z	oblib		what device is my parallel port? I'm trying to get xsane to find my scanner
2005-12-02T13:22:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	oblib	try "dmesg"
2005-12-02T13:23:00.000Z	oblib	pppoe_dude	do you know much about xsane
2005-12-02T13:24:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	oblib	what do you need to know?
2005-12-02T13:24:00.000Z	oblib	pppoe_dude	xsane plustek_pp:/dev/parport0 should find my scanner, but it gets an i/o error
2005-12-02T13:24:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	oblib	type "scanimage -L" what do you get?
2005-12-02T13:25:00.000Z	oblib	pppoe_dude	by default it finds my TV card and "scans' from that
2005-12-02T13:25:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	oblib	only shows you the tv card?
2005-12-02T13:25:00.000Z	oblib	pppoe_dude	yeah
2005-12-02T13:26:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	oblib	k.. that means your scanner was not detected and is not loaded... you need to probably download some modules or drivers for it
2005-12-02T13:26:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	oblib	after plugging it in, what do the last two lines of dmesg saay?
2005-12-02T13:26:00.000Z	oblib	pppoe_dude	I would believe that. I do I find them
2005-12-02T13:26:00.000Z	oblib	pppoe_dude	plugging it in? It parallel port.
2005-12-02T13:27:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	oblib	yes
2005-12-02T13:27:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	oblib	type dmesg and tell me what it says
2005-12-02T13:27:00.000Z	oblib	pppoe_dude	plugging in the scanner? The last two lines are Bluetooth and ibm_acpi
2005-12-02T13:28:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	oblib	is the scanner powered up?
2005-12-02T13:28:00.000Z	oblib	pppoe_dude	sorry I have to go now, thanks for the help though. I'll try again later
2005-12-02T13:28:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	oblib	k
