2007-07-02T14:02:00.000Z	sel	RustySford	sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop    then    killall -9 gdm

2007-07-02T14:07:00.000Z	RustySford		hmm when I kill Xorg it just logs me out..sorta. brings me to the log in screen without actually loging out.....
2007-07-02T14:07:00.000Z	RustySford		but even if I just try it under failsafe mode or just stright up black screen with working commands it still says x is running
