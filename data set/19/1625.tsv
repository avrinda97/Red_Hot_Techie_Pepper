2012-03-28T23:56:00.000Z	Amoz	mody	what's your problem?
2012-03-28T23:57:00.000Z	Amoz	mody	that's because it's much easier for everyone to help if you can paste everything
2012-03-28T23:57:00.000Z	mody	Amoz	i had ubuntu and windows 7 side by side for  months, today i did a recovery for windows and that messed up the grub, i cant boot to windows nor ubuntu anymore all i get is partition message with grub rescue , so now i run live cd and did another ubuntu installation thought i lost my old one and now i think i have more than 5 partition in /dev
2012-03-28T23:58:00.000Z	Amoz	mody	are you using the manual/expert mode when partitioning during ubuntu install?
2012-03-28T23:59:00.000Z	mody	Amoz	i didnt do any partition, my grub is just not working any more
2012-03-28T23:59:00.000Z	Amoz	mody	you said you reinstalled?
2012-03-29T00:02:00.000Z	Amoz	mody	do you have a CLI?
2012-03-29T00:02:00.000Z	Amoz	mody	if so, just install pastebinit
2012-03-29T00:02:00.000Z	Amoz	mody	sudo apt-get install pastebinit
2012-03-29T00:03:00.000Z	Amoz	mody	then do fdisk -l | pastebinit
2012-03-29T00:03:00.000Z	Amoz	mody	and you'll get a link
2012-03-29T00:03:00.000Z	mody	Amoz	pastebinit has no installation candidate
2012-03-29T00:03:00.000Z	Amoz	mody	what version are you on? do apt-get update first
2012-03-29T00:11:00.000Z	mody	Amoz	now trying boot repair, hope it works
