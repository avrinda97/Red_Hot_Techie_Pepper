2010-05-08T21:42:00.000Z	theGman		How does one downgrade a specific app to a specific vers? Wine for instance..?
2010-05-08T21:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	theGman	 in the past ive also removed wine. then downloaded/installed the specicic version i needed
2010-05-08T21:43:00.000Z	theGman	Dr_Willis	Thx! In an other dist I used that was "frowned upon" so I thought I had better ask first...still new to ubuntu :)
2010-05-08T21:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	theGman	 wine is very much a 'hammer it till it works with your app you need to run' sort of thing
2010-05-08T21:46:00.000Z	theGman	Dr_Willis	It would seem that the "pinning" option is the opposite to what I need. I am on 10.04 and the wine vers installed is: wine-1.1.42 but I need to downgrade to at least 1.1.5...
2010-05-08T21:52:00.000Z	theGman	Dr_Willis	So, since pinning is sort of opposite what I need, how would one dg wine to 1.1.5?
2010-05-13T19:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	theGman	 on what topic?
2010-05-13T19:29:00.000Z	theGman	Dr_Willis	What the settings should be in dancer-services/settings.conf?
2010-05-13T19:30:00.000Z	theGman	Dr_Willis	(See my other posts :P )
2010-05-13T19:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	theGman	  I would check the dancer homepage/wiki/docs   if the utulity has rather poor docs. it may be worth while to use an alterantive that is better documented.,
2010-05-13T19:30:00.000Z	theGman	Dr_Willis	I've been googling my butt off with no success..
2010-05-13T19:30:00.000Z	theGman	Dr_Willis	Know of one?
2010-05-13T19:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	theGman	 The program dosent even mention a 'homepage' when you google about it? Definatly time to find another program then.
2010-05-13T19:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	theGman	 many of those things often are based on another  that might have more docs..
2010-05-13T19:31:00.000Z	theGman	Dr_Willis	Right. But which...THAT is the true question eh?
2010-05-13T19:32:00.000Z	theGman	Dr_Willis	This: dancer-ircd-doc was installed but I have NO idea how to use it... o.O
2010-05-13T19:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	theGman	 you looked in /usr/share/docs ? or was it /usr/share/doc ?
2010-05-13T19:33:00.000Z	theGman	Dr_Willis	I just saw the pkg as installed. So far...looking...
2010-05-13T19:35:00.000Z	theGman	Dr_Willis	Found that at any rate :P
