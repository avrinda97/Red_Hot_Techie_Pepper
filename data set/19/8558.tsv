2007-03-28T07:10:00.000Z	abasinisvacant		i don't know how to check if i have a separate partition for /home
2007-03-28T07:11:00.000Z	robjo	abasinisvacant	run the mount command and look for home. If it shows up it's on a separate partition
2007-03-28T07:13:00.000Z	robjo	abasinisvacant	then /home is not on a separate partition
2007-03-28T07:17:00.000Z	robjo	abasinisvacant	why don't you burn the data to CD?
2007-03-28T07:17:00.000Z	abasinisvacant	robjo	i don't have a burner
2007-03-28T07:18:00.000Z	robjo	abasinisvacant	USB stick?
2007-03-28T07:18:00.000Z	abasinisvacant	robjo	my usb port is damaged
2007-03-28T07:20:00.000Z	robjo	abasinisvacant	presume you have only one machine?
2007-03-28T07:20:00.000Z	abasinisvacant	robjo	two
2007-03-28T07:20:00.000Z	abasinisvacant	robjo	could i use a modem cable?
2007-03-28T07:20:00.000Z	robjo	abasinisvacant	Than your better of pushing your files to the second machine via ftp, just make a tarball.
2007-03-28T07:21:00.000Z	abasinisvacant	robjo	i don't know how to connect the two computers together
2007-03-28T07:22:00.000Z	robjo	abasinisvacant	if you get an ethernet switch you can hook up both machines to the switch and set up a LAN should take about 15 minutes.
2007-03-28T07:22:00.000Z	abasinisvacant	robjo	15 minutes and $50?
2007-03-28T07:23:00.000Z	robjo	abasinisvacant	if you just get a switch it should be less than $50.
2007-03-28T07:24:00.000Z	abasinisvacant	robjo	what about 'partitioning', ?  would that be easy?
2007-03-28T07:25:00.000Z	robjo	abasinisvacant	I've never trusted the repartitioning, too chicken to try. Other people may have done this and have good experience.
2007-03-28T07:26:00.000Z	abasinisvacant	robjo	but do you know how?  i'd like to try- i think it's worth risking my files (because it is my last option before i decide to just lose my files)
2007-03-28T07:29:00.000Z	robjo	abasinisvacant	IMHO your best option is to invest in an ethernet switch and save your files on your second machine. No, I don't know how to repartition but this was being discussed here at the same time, gparted?
