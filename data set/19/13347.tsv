2005-04-20T10:03:00.000Z	ml267		ok, can i just replace all the "warty" with "hoary" in my sources.list and do a dist-upgrade?
2005-04-20T10:04:00.000Z	ml267		do i have to do anything special in synaptic to make it pickup the packages list from my hoary cd?
2005-04-20T10:05:00.000Z	memnoc	ml267	it usually comes with that repository already configured.. i actually removed it so it doesn't keep looking for the CD everytime..
2005-04-20T10:06:00.000Z	ml267	memnoc	i have the reverse situation... i have a CD and want to upgrade with it before hitting the repositories
2005-04-20T10:07:00.000Z	memnoc	ml267	i'm not quite sure the exact line i deleted.. just a sec, i'll look it up
2005-04-20T10:07:00.000Z	ml267	memnoc	that's alright, apt-cdrom gave me a line
2005-04-20T10:08:00.000Z	memnoc	ml267	yea.. that too :)
2005-04-20T10:08:00.000Z	ml267	memnoc	maybe apt-cdrom is all i need to get apt to remember about my cd.  *fingers-crossed*
2005-04-20T10:09:00.000Z	memnoc	ml267	i think you need to do some kind of add command to get it in the repo list..
2005-04-20T10:10:00.000Z	ml267		wow, the repositories are really swamped..  taking a long time just to download the packages file.  'am glad i bittorrented the CD to do the upgrade
2005-04-20T10:10:00.000Z	memnoc	ml267	edit /etc/apt/sources.list and add 'deb cdrom:/ hoary main restricted' somewhere in there..
2005-04-20T10:11:00.000Z	memnoc	ml267	i'm not 100% on this, so make sure to backup first..
2005-04-20T10:11:00.000Z	ml267	memnoc	yeah.. i've at least backed up my /home
2005-04-20T10:12:00.000Z	memnoc		hehe Dreamer* is ghosting all over.
2005-04-20T10:12:00.000Z	ml267		i wonder if it's safe to do the upgrade while I'm in X/Gnome.  maybe i should boot to single user mode to do this?
2005-04-20T10:13:00.000Z	memnoc	ml267	i upgraded while working as usual.. then i just rebooted..
2005-04-20T10:13:00.000Z	ml267	memnoc	sweet :)
2005-04-20T10:13:00.000Z	memnoc	ml267	i'm sure it isn't recommended, but i haven't noticed any errors. :)
2005-04-20T10:15:00.000Z	ml267	memnoc	 alright, I think i'll do it the classic debian way...  apt-get dist-upgrade from a single user console
