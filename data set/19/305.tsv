2012-04-30T01:34:00.000Z	djp		So.. I managed to get a root terminal up from recovery mode, and then had to get a legacy keyboard, because the USB sub-system is not woking.. from here I want to resume the upgrade problem.. but guess what? no networking! no eth0.. sould I have started recovery mode with a switch to enable networking (sigh) ?
2012-04-30T01:35:00.000Z	krababbel	djp	up the network yourself if there is no switch?
2012-04-30T01:36:00.000Z	krababbel	djp	can you do that?
2012-04-30T01:36:00.000Z	djp	krababbel	whatever do you mean, like a comman-line switch?
2012-04-30T01:37:00.000Z	krababbel	djp	what does 'ip addr' say/
2012-04-30T01:37:00.000Z	krababbel	djp	does eth0 show an ip4 address?
2012-04-30T01:38:00.000Z	krababbel	djp	'ip link' , is it ther?
2012-04-30T01:43:00.000Z	krababbel	djp	since ip link gave nothing you have to add it. Try ip link add link eth0

2012-04-30T01:54:00.000Z	krababbel	djp	maybe the drivers are not loaded yes
2012-04-30T02:25:00.000Z	djp	krababbel	what did you tell me to echo > ?
2012-04-30T02:29:00.000Z	krababbel	djp	nothing, just repeated
2012-04-30T02:30:00.000Z	djp	krababbel	I seem to have misplace a crucual file i wrongly renamed..
2012-04-30T02:31:00.000Z	krababbel	djp	that file is automatically created by udev i believe
2012-04-30T02:32:00.000Z	krababbel	djp	why are you in rescue mode again?
2012-04-30T02:32:00.000Z	krababbel	djp	can't you chroot into your system from the livecd and do what you want from there?
2012-04-30T02:33:00.000Z	krababbel	djp	lol
2012-04-30T02:36:00.000Z	krababbel	djp	I believe chroot from here should work, but I don't know what you actually want to do. Video driver broken?http://karuppuswamy.com/wordpress/2010/06/02/how-to-chroot-to-ubuntu-using-live-cd-to-fix-grub-rescue-prompt/
2012-04-30T02:36:00.000Z	djp	krababbel	what I really want to do is get networking up on the box to hopefully contunue and complete the 12.04 upgrade
