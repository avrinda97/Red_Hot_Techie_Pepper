2006-03-24T15:05:00.000Z	katarot		can someone help with my dell inprion 1300 and dell mini-pci card i have used ndiswrapper and it works fine the hardware is present and so is the driver but i still cant get it to detect the card for some reseon it works fine on xp
2006-03-24T15:05:00.000Z	cohonen	katarot	ofcause it works on xp
2006-03-24T15:06:00.000Z	katarot	cohonen	why is it not working on ubuntu then
2006-03-24T15:06:00.000Z	cohonen	katarot	because the vendor is a nasty type who wont suuport linux and release tech docs so a proper opensource driver can be written
2006-03-24T15:07:00.000Z	katarot	cohonen	i read on the forum that dell does something to the card to make sure it only turns on when dell turns on could this be true
2006-03-24T15:08:00.000Z	cohonen	katarot	i dont understand what you mean
2006-03-24T15:09:00.000Z	katarot	cohonen	someone said that dell made the card so it turns it self on with xp
2006-03-24T15:09:00.000Z	cohonen	katarot	i doubt that
2006-03-24T15:10:00.000Z	cohonen	katarot	it just has a working driver
2006-03-24T15:10:00.000Z	cohonen	katarot	anyway ,, another time ,, go for a thinkpad t or x .. they have exceptional linux support
2006-03-24T15:11:00.000Z	katarot	cohonen	why does ndiswrapper not work i have did it correctly i got the drivers from dell \
2006-03-24T15:11:00.000Z	cohonen	katarot	beats me ,, maybe ndiswrapper isnt as good as you think it is
2006-03-24T15:12:00.000Z	katarot	cohonen	native driver confuse me i got one but dont know what to do with it
2006-03-24T15:13:00.000Z	cohonen	katarot	well a native driver would be one thats actually made to drive your device on the "native" os ,, that is,, in this case linux
2006-03-24T15:13:00.000Z	katarot	cohonen	how would i install it
2006-03-24T15:14:00.000Z	cohonen	katarot	have no idea,, im a hardware freak ,, i only buy hardware i know linux has native drivers for
2006-03-24T15:14:00.000Z	cohonen	katarot	sure,, but there  must be guides on google
2006-03-24T15:15:00.000Z	cohonen	katarot	you could search for your laptop on tuxmobile.org or linuxonlaptops
2006-03-24T15:15:00.000Z	cohonen	katarot	its very easy to build a new kernel
