2011-07-31T10:14:00.000Z	beanluc		and sudo means do it with extreme prejudice
2011-07-31T10:15:00.000Z	beanluc		sudo show my drive in /dev so i can fkn mount it
2011-07-31T10:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	beanluc	use:  sudo fdisk -l    and you'll see them
2011-07-31T10:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	beanluc	sudo can't show you anything, it's not it's job to
2011-07-31T10:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	beanluc	it doesn't need to be for fdisk to list it
2011-07-31T10:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	beanluc	I know what you said
2011-07-31T10:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	beanluc	yes then the system has detected 2 drives
2011-07-31T10:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	beanluc	then sdb isn't detected
2011-07-31T10:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	beanluc	being detected and being mounted are very different
2011-07-31T10:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	beanluc	is it a hard drive? or an SD card?
2011-07-31T10:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	beanluc	does it show in BIOS?
2011-07-31T10:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	beanluc	its the first thing to check, also avoid using cable select and set it to a master or slave etc
2011-07-31T10:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	beanluc	if you have 2 slaves on the same controller it won't work
2011-07-31T10:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	beanluc	well I DON'T know that do I
2011-07-31T10:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	beanluc	I'd make sure they are detected in BIOS first. Simply slinging them into a system and powering on without checking basic stuff like that isn't wise
2011-07-31T10:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	beanluc	no, you will need an iLo or DRAC card to see bios remotely (or similar technology)
2011-07-31T10:24:00.000Z	beanluc	ActionParsnip	yes
2011-08-08T00:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	beanluc	sudo fdisk -l      will show you
2011-08-08T00:13:00.000Z	beanluc	ActionParsnip	OmegaForte: thanks for your answers... so /dev/sda* is the only device apparent... I have 2 external firewire drives connected, powered on... any suggestions why I can't see 'em?
