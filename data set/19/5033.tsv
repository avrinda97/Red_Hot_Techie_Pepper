2008-09-18T22:09:00.000Z	cads		hello
2008-09-18T22:09:00.000Z	cads		aska, not doing too good
2008-09-18T22:11:00.000Z	cads		I was trying out a suggestion for a bugfix for my video drivers, involving setting the VideoRam and CacheLine paramaters, and I've totally FUBARed my video
2008-09-18T22:12:00.000Z	DasEi	cads	which card ?
2008-09-18T22:15:00.000Z	cads	DasEi	the suggestion I was following involved using a different video card driver, and somehow now my DRI doesn't work, even though I have restored my xorg.conf and tried to modprobe the video module back, yes, I have tried the dpkg reconfigure... if it helps, the video driver I'm trying to use is   i810, and module I found was i810fb.so
2008-09-18T22:16:00.000Z	cads	DasEi	any ideas about what else I could do?
2008-09-18T22:17:00.000Z	DasEi	cads	modprobe snd-es1968                    ???
2008-09-18T22:18:00.000Z	cads	DasEi	I have loaded the module
2008-09-18T22:18:00.000Z	DasEi	cads	sry, nick messed
2008-09-18T22:21:00.000Z	DasEi	cads	it worked out of the box ?
2008-09-18T22:24:00.000Z	DasEi	cads	?
2008-09-18T22:24:00.000Z	cads	DasEi	if I remember correctly, I had to change the video driver from intel to i810, switch the modules, and add a DRI section with Mode 0666... i copied it from my debian setup which I worked on god knows how long ago.. I don't remember which exact modules I had to load at the time of geting that to work
2008-09-18T22:26:00.000Z	cads	DasEi	I'm downloading suse to get it's autoconfig
2008-09-18T22:26:00.000Z	DasEi	cads	always backup xorg, before any ""experiments"", but quick n dirty could start with live and then copy it's xorg.conf
2008-09-18T22:28:00.000Z	cads	DasEi	that's the part that kills me, I have the original xorg.config here, and I've even put together one from scratch
2008-09-18T22:30:00.000Z	DasEi	cads	as onboard-intel mostly works out the box, I'm not experienced with it, but did you also look up manufacturers HP for a linux driver ?
2008-09-18T22:32:00.000Z	DasEi	cads	(nick!) see, again the model for old man DasEi  ?
2008-09-18T22:35:00.000Z	DasEi	cads	you might try to start without any xorg, to force recreation
2008-09-18T22:38:00.000Z	cads	DasEi	 ah, sorry... I mean I will try to see if I can find a newer version of xorg than is in the repository
