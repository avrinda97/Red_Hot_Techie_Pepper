2005-03-17T06:32:00.000Z	johnnybezak		i think that packages are ubuntu's single biggest weakness atm, but they are getting better
2005-03-17T06:33:00.000Z	johnnybezak		not huge enough for my liking :D
2005-03-17T06:34:00.000Z	johnnybezak		yeah i had gentoo damn portage is sweet
2005-03-17T06:36:00.000Z	johnnybezak		is there some shorthand way of cd'ing up a directory?
2005-03-17T06:36:00.000Z	knapjack	johnnybezak	like 'cd ..' ?
2005-03-17T06:36:00.000Z	johnnybezak	knapjack	thats what im looking for :)
2005-03-17T06:37:00.000Z	knapjack	johnnybezak	Same trick works on Windows/DOS
2005-03-17T06:37:00.000Z	johnnybezak	knapjack	never used dos really :) (mac background)
2005-03-17T06:38:00.000Z	johnnybezak	knapjack	yeah i presume it would, i've just never looked for how to do it :)
2005-03-17T06:38:00.000Z	knapjack	johnnybezak	I have a friend on OSX that I keep giving bash hints to slowly but surely.
2005-03-17T06:39:00.000Z	johnnybezak	knapjack	hehe
2005-03-17T06:39:00.000Z	knapjack	johnnybezak	...but I love my wife's iBook.
2005-03-17T06:39:00.000Z	knapjack	johnnybezak	I would invest in a Mac if I weren't so invested in PC hardware already.
2005-03-17T06:39:00.000Z	knapjack	johnnybezak	But, a co-worker loaded Ubunut warty on an old iMac and it ran very nicely.  I was impressed.
2005-03-17T06:40:00.000Z	johnnybezak	knapjack	it's pretty nice, linux on ppc has some annoying things though
2005-03-17T06:40:00.000Z	johnnybezak	knapjack	i use flash
2005-03-17T06:40:00.000Z	johnnybezak	knapjack	i use flux *
2005-03-17T06:40:00.000Z	knapjack	johnnybezak	I hate that for things like Flash it would take Macromedia all of ten minutes to produce a PPC port.
2005-03-17T06:41:00.000Z	johnnybezak	knapjack	yeah the problem is ppc linux is a niche in a niche
