2005-04-08T06:24:00.000Z	Zedtech		can I get some serious help here? :-)
2005-04-08T06:24:00.000Z	Zedtech		I mean major
2005-04-08T06:25:00.000Z	Zedtech		Where can I configure the mouse in Ubuntu?
2005-04-08T06:25:00.000Z	Zedtech		The thing isnt supporting my mouse properly and totally flaking out
2005-04-08T06:25:00.000Z	Zedtech		I move the mouse and it just sporadically moves/clicks/opens things
2005-04-08T06:26:00.000Z	eyequeue	Zedtech	 System > Preferences > Mouse perhaps?
2005-04-08T06:26:00.000Z	Zedtech	eyequeue	I have no mouse man. Every time I Move it clicks around 1000 times a second or so. If i move it, i get about 5000 new things, the menu bars get tossed around, and everything goes haywire.
2005-04-08T06:26:00.000Z	Zedtech	eyequeue	I've tried wiring another mouse to the box, same problem.
2005-04-08T06:26:00.000Z	eyequeue	Zedtech	 did i say to use the mouse to get there?
2005-04-08T06:29:00.000Z	eyequeue	Zedtech	 can't you use the menus without a mouse?
2005-04-08T06:33:00.000Z	eyequeue	Zedtech	 sudo
2005-04-08T06:34:00.000Z	eyequeue	Zedtech	 yes, your own, you logged in with it
2005-04-08T06:36:00.000Z	eyequeue	Zedtech	 is your mouse currently "dead"?
2005-04-08T06:36:00.000Z	Zedtech	eyequeue	actually my mouse "Works". I have a cursor and its not flaking out.
2005-04-08T06:37:00.000Z	eyequeue	Zedtech	 if you need to "restart x" you can force it by restarting gnome as root, in a terminal it would be "sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart" (but your mouse is now working?  if so, don't)
2005-04-08T06:37:00.000Z	Zedtech	eyequeue	it works, but shouldnt I restart X just to test anyways?
2005-04-08T06:38:00.000Z	Zedtech	eyequeue	should I restart X?
2005-04-08T06:38:00.000Z	eyequeue	Zedtech	 well, if it's working, i'd recommend doing so *via* the mouse, a normal logout, and then you can type that sudo from a console (alt-ctrl-f1)
2005-04-08T06:40:00.000Z	eyequeue	Zedtech	 btw, are you on warty or hoary?
