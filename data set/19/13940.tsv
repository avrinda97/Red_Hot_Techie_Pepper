2005-02-16T14:31:00.000Z	vIkSiT		A deb newbie question - can i update a base ubuntu install through another debian-based distros package files?
2005-02-16T14:32:00.000Z	crimsun	vIkSiT	highly unrecommended if you mean to add external repos to ubuntu's base install
2005-02-16T14:32:00.000Z	vIkSiT	crimsun	"external repos"?
2005-02-16T14:34:00.000Z	crimsun	vIkSiT	what do you mean by "update a base ubuntu install through another debian-based distros package files?"
2005-02-16T14:35:00.000Z	vIkSiT	crimsun	well, I want to get into deb. I'm sure the ubuntu CD doesn't have all the tools which I keep experimenting with. I also have a debian distribution on a dvd with some 6k packages..
2005-02-16T14:35:00.000Z	crimsun	vIkSiT	please don't add external repos. Those packages are built against packages available in the Debian repos, not in Ubuntu's repos.
2005-02-16T14:36:00.000Z	vIkSiT	crimsun	in effect, I should use packages built specifically for Ubuntu..
2005-02-16T14:37:00.000Z	crimsun	vIkSiT	yes, that's the cleanest solution if you're new to Ubuntu (and/or Debian) and wish to avoid headaches.
2005-02-16T14:38:00.000Z	vIkSiT	crimsun	so what *major disadvantage comes out of mixing and matching the 2 repos?
2005-02-16T14:38:00.000Z	crimsun	vIkSiT	upgrade headaches, dependency hellishness, etc.
2005-02-16T14:39:00.000Z	vIkSiT	crimsun	Hmm..
2005-02-16T14:39:00.000Z	crimsun	vIkSiT	feel free to try it if you feel the need to burn yourself.
2005-02-16T14:44:00.000Z	vIkSiT	crimsun	Apart from the automated installation of Ubuntu, as compared to the 3 stage process which deb offers.. any significant advantages I'd gain by not going for deb directly?
2005-02-16T14:45:00.000Z	crimsun	vIkSiT	a well-integrated, GNOME-based, desktop-oriented Linux distribution.
2005-02-16T14:46:00.000Z	crimsun	vIkSiT	18 months of support for each stable release
2005-02-16T14:46:00.000Z	crimsun	vIkSiT	a meaningful community
