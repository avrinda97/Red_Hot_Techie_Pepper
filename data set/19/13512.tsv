2005-03-20T08:46:00.000Z	bored2k	blizah	you download steam from steampowered.com , then do cedega SteamInstall.exe , install it, and  u open thru the normal cedega STEAM.exe
2005-03-20T08:50:00.000Z	bored2k	blizah	how was ur hl2 performance on *nix?
2005-03-20T08:52:00.000Z	blizah	bored2k	im talking about old cs
2005-03-20T08:53:00.000Z	bored2k	blizah	ok cool ; I only play 1.6 on nix btw
2005-03-20T08:55:00.000Z	blizah	bored2k	1.6 = good ol' cs?
2005-03-20T08:55:00.000Z	bored2k	blizah	yes 1.6
2005-03-20T08:56:00.000Z	bored2k	blizah	i copied my apt-gotten msttcore [winblows]  fonts to the fake windows cedega installs
2005-03-20T08:56:00.000Z	blizah	bored2k	what do i do to do that :D
2005-03-20T08:57:00.000Z	bored2k	blizah	apt-get install msttcorefonts, those are crappy winblows fonts
2005-03-20T08:58:00.000Z	bored2k	blizah	after downloaded, copy all ur fonts from /usr/share/fonts/truetype/msttcorefonts/ to $HOME/Transgaming_Drive/windows/fonts/
2005-03-20T09:04:00.000Z	blizah	bored2k	one more question...any way to make steam resizable, like grab w/ the mouse and make bigger, under cedega?
2005-03-20T09:05:00.000Z	bored2k	blizah	I can hardly get it to move position at times if thats an answer ...
2005-03-20T09:06:00.000Z	bored2k	blizah	yes its annoying ; i just keep something open like a gaim window and press alt+f2 fr run app to display, wich works just as alt tab ;)
