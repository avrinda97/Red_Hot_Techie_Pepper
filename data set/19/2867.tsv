2010-01-27T13:36:00.000Z	EastDallas	montom	try installing gnome-alsamixer and turning up pcm.  this is known to help with crackling issues.
2010-01-27T13:42:00.000Z	montom	EastDallas	: how do you turn up pcm?
2010-01-27T13:42:00.000Z	EastDallas	montom	run gnome-alsamixer and you should have a slider for PCM.
2010-01-27T13:43:00.000Z	EastDallas	montom	Sound & Video>Gnome ALSA Mixer
2010-01-27T13:44:00.000Z	EastDallas	montom	of course you have to install it first (sudo apt-get gnome-alsamixer)
2010-01-27T13:47:00.000Z	EastDallas	montom	did that help?
2010-01-27T13:48:00.000Z	montom	EastDallas	: nope the PCM slide was up when i opened it , it still has the cracking sound
2010-01-27T13:50:00.000Z	EastDallas	montom	is it a constant crackling, or an occsional pop/crack sound?
2010-01-27T13:57:00.000Z	montom	EastDallas	: That does not work either .. does it help if tell you the laptop make ?
2010-01-27T14:04:00.000Z	EastDallas	montom	I'm trying to find the original instrux I used to fix my problem....just a sec
2010-01-27T14:08:00.000Z	EastDallas	montom	I found the original instrux and they just say to comment out that line.  You might try restarting pulseaudio by typing pulseaudio -k in a terminal and then restart it by hitting alt
2010-01-27T14:09:00.000Z	EastDallas	montom	alt +f2 and typing pulseaudio
2010-01-27T14:16:00.000Z	montom	EastDallas	: do i have to install pulseaudio first?
2010-01-27T14:17:00.000Z	EastDallas	montom	Did you remove it?  I believe (somebody correct me if I'm wrong)it's installed by default
2010-01-27T14:23:00.000Z	EastDallas	montom	were you able to restart pulseaudio?
2010-01-27T14:25:00.000Z	montom	EastDallas	: yeah  i was but still the cracking sound does not go away , you mentioned it is a power save problem , i dont know if this helps but when i installed 9.10 i have to turn acpi=off could that be the problem?
2010-01-27T14:26:00.000Z	EastDallas	montom	honestly, I don't know if turning acpi off would have an effect.  I just know the line you have to comment out as I suggested is related to power save.
2010-01-27T14:28:00.000Z	montom	EastDallas	: thanks for the help
2010-01-27T14:29:00.000Z	EastDallas	montom	sorry I wasn't of more help...u might want to look at this: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1311207
