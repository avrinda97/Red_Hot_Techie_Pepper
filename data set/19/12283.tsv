2009-03-04T17:48:00.000Z	elad`		sftp from the shell - how do I delete a directory that has files in it? I keep getting "Failure".
2009-03-04T17:48:00.000Z	elad`		"Couldn't delete file: Failure"
2009-03-04T17:49:00.000Z	elad`		Couldn't stat remote file: No such file or directory
2009-03-04T17:49:00.000Z	elad`		Removing /home/root/-r
2009-03-04T17:49:00.000Z	elad`		Couldn't delete file: No such file or directory
2009-03-04T17:49:00.000Z	elad`		(It thinks -r is a dir)
2009-03-04T17:50:00.000Z	elad`		zzz
2009-03-04T17:51:00.000Z	elad`		(That's the name of the folder.)
2009-03-04T17:53:00.000Z	elad`		What's the command for deleting a given dir, and all its contents, from an SFTP server?
2009-03-04T17:53:00.000Z	elad`		Say the server is username:password@1.1.1.1
2009-03-04T17:54:00.000Z	mneptok	elad`	if you have SFTP you probably have ssh. just use the shell.
2009-03-04T17:55:00.000Z	mneptok	elad`	run a cron job on the local host to move things.
2009-03-04T17:56:00.000Z	mneptok	elad`	the SFTP syntax is the same as FTP
2009-03-04T17:57:00.000Z	mneptok	elad`	rm -r is shell.
2009-03-04T17:58:00.000Z	mneptok	elad`	ActionParsnip told you the syntax
2009-05-13T22:31:00.000Z	mneptok	elad`	what do you want to do?
2009-05-13T22:32:00.000Z	mneptok	elad`	read and post to Usenet? sudo apt-get install pan
2009-05-13T22:32:00.000Z	mneptok	elad`	sudo apt-get install pan
2009-05-13T22:37:00.000Z	elad`	mneptok	thanks.
