2009-11-04T06:39:00.000Z	philh	hellyes	i get the idea
2009-11-04T06:37:00.000Z	philh	hellyes	maybe win7 has better security defaults or auth methods that aren't supported by the gnome samba gui
2009-11-04T06:37:00.000Z	philh	hellyes	can you access a totally public share with no restrictions?
2009-11-04T06:37:00.000Z	hellyes	philh	even though I have the firewalls turned off on both win 7 and ubuntu?
2009-11-04T06:38:00.000Z	philh	hellyes	yes, nothing to do with firewalls
2009-11-04T06:38:00.000Z	hellyes	philh	I can access my windows XP laptop no problems, but not win 7 drive, even though I can see it on the network.
2009-11-04T06:39:00.000Z	philh	hellyes	so it sounds like an issue with share config on win7, try customising the share somehow?
2009-11-04T06:39:00.000Z	hellyes	philh	when I try to access the win 7 shared drive from ubuntu, I get an error: "unable to mount location.......failed to retrieve share list from server"
2009-11-04T06:39:00.000Z	hellyes	philh	any ideas about specifics in the win 7 sharing?
2009-11-04T06:51:00.000Z	philh	hellyes	you seem to be plucking totally random and weird reasons for failure
2009-11-04T06:52:00.000Z	hellyes	philh	I've just been working on this for days and I can't get the win 7 to share with ubuntu.  I have NO idea what to do.  I've read about every forum I could
2009-11-04T06:53:00.000Z	philh	hellyes	i think you need to make win7 less picky
2009-11-04T07:10:00.000Z	philh	hellyes	for what?
2009-11-04T07:10:00.000Z	hellyes	philh	will it matter what encryption is used in order to talk between ubuntu and win 7 machines?
2009-11-04T07:11:00.000Z	philh	hellyes	i have no idea, i think you need a samba or win7 expert
2009-11-04T12:16:00.000Z	hellyes	philh	remember when I said I couldn't get ubuntu to share a drive w/ windows 7?
2009-11-04T12:17:00.000Z	philh	hellyes	yep
2009-11-04T12:17:00.000Z	hellyes	philh	I just downgraded back to 9.04 and it works great
2009-11-04T12:17:00.000Z	philh	hellyes	interesting
