2010-01-10T20:32:00.000Z	yorick		hello, I'm trying to get my tablet to run under ubuntu 9.10
2010-01-10T20:33:00.000Z	yorick		it reports under windows as aiptek
2010-01-10T20:33:00.000Z	yorick		but there are 20.000 guides for these things and I don't know which to follow
2010-01-10T20:34:00.000Z	yorick		so I think this is one of those aiptek tablets with wacom chipset
2010-01-10T20:34:00.000Z	yorick		it reports as WALTOP International Corp. Slim Tablet
2010-01-10T20:36:00.000Z	yorick		it appears like the wacom driver is not recognizing it
2010-01-10T20:38:00.000Z	yorick		so how do I get my tablet to work as a proper tablet
2010-01-10T20:39:00.000Z	jcc1	yorick	doesn't google <your system> + linux give you any good install sites?
2010-01-10T20:40:00.000Z	yorick	jcc1	yes, but they all say something else
2010-01-10T20:43:00.000Z	jcc1	yorick	Have you seen bmcage's post here? http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=477287
2010-01-10T20:44:00.000Z	yorick	jcc1	ah thank you :)
2010-01-10T20:44:00.000Z	jcc1	yorick	 I used this as a search term in Google, tons of hits "WALTOP International Corp. Slim Tablet + linux + install problems"
2010-01-10T20:50:00.000Z	yorick	jcc1	so, after changing my xorg conf I should restart my X server?
2010-01-10T20:51:00.000Z	jcc1	yorick	yes, I would just reboot to see if it "took"
2010-01-10T20:52:00.000Z	yorick	jcc1	hmm...what do I do if it doesn't like my changes to xorg.conf?
2010-01-10T20:56:00.000Z	yorick	jcc1	nope...didn't work
2010-01-10T20:57:00.000Z	jcc1	yorick	bummer... I don't have that particular setup. If it were me I would use the search term I set above in Google "WALTOP International Corp. Slim Tablet + linux + install problems" and just keep trying... someone must have the answer that owns one of these
2010-01-10T20:59:00.000Z	yorick	jcc1	ok, thanks for trying :)
2010-01-10T20:59:00.000Z	jcc1	yorick	Good Luck with it...
