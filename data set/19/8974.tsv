2007-02-28T09:54:00.000Z	steel_lady		ok, can somebody tell me why they didn't implement drag'n'drop function in ubuntu? I think it is one of the things that makes windows magic
2007-02-28T09:54:00.000Z	Hirvinen	steel_lady	What particular drag'n'drop function do you mean?
2007-02-28T09:55:00.000Z	Hirvinen	steel_lady	At least in KDE one can drag'n'drop a whole lot more things than I know to be drag'n'droppable under Windows.
2007-02-28T09:57:00.000Z	steel_lady	Hirvinen	for eg. I choos a bunch of mp3s from the window holding control and throw it over the winamp and it plays. I can drop some other file over some program and it is opened in that program. but the worst is this thing that I have to go through the meny in xmms
2007-02-28T09:58:00.000Z	Hirvinen	steel_lady	At least under KDE one can drag'n'drop files into XMMS just fine.
2007-02-28T09:59:00.000Z	steel_lady	Hirvinen	how can I found out if it doesn't work in gnome or what?
2007-02-28T10:01:00.000Z	steel_lady	Hirvinen	does in KDE also exist the right click menu 'enqueue song in xmmc'?
2007-02-28T10:01:00.000Z	Hirvinen	steel_lady	Yes, it can have that.
2007-02-28T10:02:00.000Z	Hirvinen	steel_lady	I don't recall if the enqueue function was there automatically, but in case it wasn't it's very easy to do it yourself.
2007-02-28T10:02:00.000Z	Hirvinen	steel_lady	I haven't used GNOME all that much but I've got the impression that it tries to be closer to OS X than Windows. KDE, on the other hand, much more resembles Windows in terms of UI, without many of the annoyances and a lot more power, if that's what you prefer. Perhaps you should give Kubuntu a try(install the package kubuntu-desktop).
2007-02-28T10:02:00.000Z	steel_lady	Hirvinen	do you know should I do something from the program to add that option or it doesn't work in gnome?
2007-02-28T10:04:00.000Z	Hirvinen	steel_lady	Sorry, my knowledge of GNOME is very limited.
2007-02-28T10:04:00.000Z	steel_lady	Hirvinen	I would like to put kubuntu but I am working oon some things and I am very afraid to mess up my system now
2007-02-28T10:04:00.000Z	steel_lady	Hirvinen	you said it is easy to add the enqueue option myself. How?
2007-02-28T10:08:00.000Z	Hirvinen	steel_lady	I meant under KDE. There. it's e.g. right clicking a file -> open with -> other ... and then entering xmms -e as the command(unless there's a menu entry "Enqueue in XMMS" under multimedia.")
2007-02-28T10:13:00.000Z	steel_lady	Hirvinen	but that thing should set the file always open in that player. And for clicking on the file, it will open that file,, not add it on the playlist after others
2007-02-28T10:14:00.000Z	Hirvinen	steel_lady	There's a checkbox for "remember this file association" or something like that.
2007-02-28T10:16:00.000Z	steel_lady	Hirvinen	it is not about the file association, that part is doing fine. As I said, I have a lots of albums of various artists and I am composing playlists. In windows it works beautifully but in linux you can't avoid browsing menu if you want songs from various folders in a playlist
2007-02-28T10:17:00.000Z	Hirvinen	steel_lady	If you want a lot of control over your music, I'd suggest a non-dead player project, such as Amarok.
