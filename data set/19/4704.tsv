2008-11-19T06:13:00.000Z	P_		is there a log somewhere of what is happening when you are starting the live cd ? It goes to a bash for a reason
2008-11-19T06:15:00.000Z	P_		has someone had some problems with 8.1 when booting the cd and choosing to install on a lappy ?
2008-11-19T06:16:00.000Z	BlueEagle	P_	I guess one or two people have experienced some difficulties. Anything in particular that's occuring on your system?
2008-11-19T06:17:00.000Z	P_	BlueEagle	it's going straight to the command prompt after the laoding screen, this is when running the live cd and i have no idea what i can do from there
2008-11-19T06:19:00.000Z	BlueEagle	P_	I see. Have you tried running with the pci=no-acpi boot option?
2008-11-19T06:20:00.000Z	BlueEagle	P_	What does the log say about starting X?
2008-11-19T06:20:00.000Z	P_	BlueEagle	i doesn't even go that far
2008-11-19T06:20:00.000Z	BlueEagle	P_	I see. Would you mind telling me where it stops?
2008-11-19T06:21:00.000Z	P_	BlueEagle	i'm downloading the alternate and i ll try that, i can tell you the content of the log next time i try but if i remember correctly it was something about bios pnp
2008-11-19T06:21:00.000Z	BlueEagle	P_	ie. do you have a command prompt where you can type commands? Does the screen blink at all before you are given the prompt? Have you tried pressing F1 during boot to see the actual messages? Do they give you any sensible errors?
2008-11-19T06:23:00.000Z	P_	BlueEagle	i can see the loading bar, and then it goes into the command prompt after 15 sec, minimal stuff with "box" in the name, i can't remember the exact prompt name, but no error execpt the bios pnp stuff which is i believe a warning
2008-11-19T06:24:00.000Z	BlueEagle	P_	Well that doesn't sound like an acpi bug...
2008-11-19T06:24:00.000Z	P_	BlueEagle	yeah i just said the problems i had with my previous version, but it was installing fine
2008-11-19T06:25:00.000Z	BlueEagle	P_	Have you checked the integrity of the disc?
2008-11-19T06:26:00.000Z	P_	BlueEagle	yes and i tried with kubuntu and ubuntu live cds
2008-11-19T06:26:00.000Z	BlueEagle	P_	Do you get an error that sais that the kernel is not suitable for your computer?
2008-11-19T06:26:00.000Z	P_	BlueEagle	no
2008-11-19T06:27:00.000Z	BlueEagle	P_	Then I'm all out of ideas, sorry.
2008-11-19T06:27:00.000Z	P_	BlueEagle	no worries, and i get no info on the forums about that
