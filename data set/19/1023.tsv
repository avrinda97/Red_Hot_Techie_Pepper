2011-06-09T23:59:00.000Z	Northernen		There have been reported a lot of issues with nVidia. Would probably try with the proprietary drivers.
2011-06-10T00:00:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Northernen	not good advice ,the proprietaries are flaky at best
2011-06-10T00:01:00.000Z	Northernen	BluesKaj	Oh? My proprietary ATI drivers works just fine.
2011-06-10T00:03:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Northernen	ok ,maybe ati proprietaries do , but tnoty the nvidia ...the nvidia recommended driver is in syste/admin/addtional driver s , howver will probly work
2011-06-10T00:04:00.000Z	Northernen	BluesKaj	Yes, I've heard there are differences between nVidia and ATI, with nVidia having some problems. I was just offering a suggestion though, as I had problems with 3D acceleration with the drivers which came with my default Ubuntu installation.
2011-06-10T00:06:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Northernen	I tried the the nvidia site drivers ...they don't worj for the 7 or 8000 series gerforce cards
2011-06-10T00:06:00.000Z	Northernen	BluesKaj	What is the name of your graphics card?
2011-06-10T00:07:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Northernen	read above
2011-07-09T17:46:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Northernen	alt+f2 type in gksudo amdcccle
2011-07-09T17:47:00.000Z	Northernen	BluesKaj	ah brilliant.
2011-07-09T17:48:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Northernen	I used to have ati/amd as wel
2011-07-15T01:03:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Northernen	jockey
2011-07-15T01:08:00.000Z	Northernen	BluesKaj	will that kill the process as well, or just remove the lock?
2011-07-15T01:08:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Northernen	yes run that command
2011-07-15T01:10:00.000Z	Northernen	BluesKaj	it didn't kill it: http://pastebin.com/mRWuzPZM
2011-07-15T01:13:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Northernen	were you trying to install a graphics driver , because it looks like the additional drivers is trying to install a wifi driver from that paste
2011-07-15T01:14:00.000Z	Northernen	BluesKaj	that's something different. The wifi driver installation ran into some issues as well, so that's just a warning about that.
2011-07-15T01:21:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Northernen	try sudo dpkg --clear-avail
2011-07-15T01:26:00.000Z	Northernen	BluesKaj	didn't do anything.
