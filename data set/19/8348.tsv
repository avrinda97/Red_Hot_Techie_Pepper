2008-03-20T04:20:00.000Z	erle-	Jack_Sparrow	sorry
2008-07-20T17:26:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	erle-	Perhaps your question can be answered in #ubuntu-server
2008-07-20T17:28:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	erle-	If you cant use the keyboard you dont have other options
2008-07-20T17:28:00.000Z	erle-	Jack_Sparrow	i can use some special keys that still work
2008-07-20T17:29:00.000Z	erle-	Jack_Sparrow	its just the regular keys that do not
2008-07-20T17:29:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	erle-	You just said you cant use the keyboard...
2008-07-20T17:31:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	erle-	num lock just means your keyboard has power, it isnt sending a code to the pc
2008-07-20T17:31:00.000Z	erle-	Jack_Sparrow	no, numlock tells me that kernel is alive
2008-07-20T17:42:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	erle-	I can put +5v and gnd to a keyboard and get the leds to toglle without a pc
2008-07-20T17:43:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	erle-	You need to go ask in server... thanks
2008-07-20T17:46:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	erle-	For a third time I will ask nicely that you move your question to the #ubuntu-server channel
2008-07-20T17:47:00.000Z	erle-	Jack_Sparrow	yeah, thank you
2008-07-20T17:48:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	erle-	Please stop
2008-07-20T17:57:00.000Z	erle-	Jack_Sparrow	sorry, i did not want to bug anyone, i just hoped for a answer, but i think there is no simple one
2008-07-20T18:08:00.000Z	erle-	Jack_Sparrow	i have finally found a solution, maybe you are interested
