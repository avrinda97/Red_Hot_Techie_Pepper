2012-11-28T09:53:00.000Z	hittt		is there any preferences anywhere
2012-11-28T09:55:00.000Z	dr_willis	hittt	seeral settings and 3rd party tweak tools exist
2012-11-28T09:57:00.000Z	hittt	dr_willis	any idea how to reach the settings? and how is the 3rd party tool called?
2012-11-28T09:58:00.000Z	dr_willis	hittt	depends on what you want to change
2012-11-28T09:58:00.000Z	dr_willis	hittt	thats vague.
2012-11-28T09:59:00.000Z	dr_willis	hittt	 use the source  then i guess
2012-11-28T10:00:00.000Z	hittt	dr_willis	im not really in the mood of touching the source, i just need access to the preferences and that 3rd party thingy
2012-11-28T10:01:00.000Z	dr_willis	hittt	those wont do 'everything'
2012-11-28T10:02:00.000Z	hittt	dr_willis	im not going for everything or nothing. I just need to change whatever i can from here
2012-11-28T10:13:00.000Z	dr_willis	hittt	 go to console.. "sudo service lightdm restart"
2012-11-28T10:41:00.000Z	dr_willis	hittt	 seen some reports of a bug like that
2012-11-28T10:42:00.000Z	hittt	dr_willis	by the way not only i was typing my password here

2012-11-28T11:40:00.000Z	dr_willis	hittt	you mean gnome-shell or the gnome2 look fallback mode?
2012-11-28T11:41:00.000Z	hittt	dr_willis	i have no idea which one this is
2012-11-28T11:41:00.000Z	dr_willis	hittt	check youtube for videos of each.  ;-)
2012-11-28T11:43:00.000Z	dr_willis	hittt	theres some tweak tools to do it
