2009-07-20T11:21:00.000Z	richardcavell	bucky	I'd rather not downgrade my driver
2009-07-20T11:09:00.000Z	bucky	richardcavell	do you have nvidia?
2009-07-20T11:10:00.000Z	richardcavell	bucky	no, Intel
2009-07-20T11:13:00.000Z	bucky	richardcavell	is this on a lappy?
2009-07-20T11:13:00.000Z	richardcavell	bucky	yep
2009-07-20T11:13:00.000Z	bucky	richardcavell	check this out, you'll have to sign a waiver first
2009-07-20T11:21:00.000Z	richardcavell	bucky	I'd rather they just fixed the one's that there
2009-07-20T11:21:00.000Z	bucky	richardcavell	sorry i couldn't be of more help
2009-07-20T11:21:00.000Z	richardcavell	bucky	that's okay.  It's a shame they don't fix it because the Intel GMA950 chipset is rather common
2009-07-20T11:22:00.000Z	richardcavell	bucky	Fedora 11 won't even boot on GMA950

2009-07-20T11:30:00.000Z	bucky	richardcavell	no..
2009-07-20T11:30:00.000Z	richardcavell	bucky	it's definitely not for beginners
2009-07-20T12:54:00.000Z	bucky	richardcavell	how about your graphics?
2009-07-20T12:54:00.000Z	richardcavell	bucky	I'm using the default driver. Performance isn't really an issue - I can't run games on this GPU anyway.
2009-07-20T12:56:00.000Z	richardcavell	bucky	ask in a gcc channel
