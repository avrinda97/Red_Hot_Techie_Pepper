2011-01-05T22:52:00.000Z	BluesKaj		heh, you guys are in luck the spambot is down for the count :)
2011-01-05T22:53:00.000Z	Visuex	BluesKaj	Myrtti it isnt spam and I have as you may have noticed I started talking to zacetnik
2011-01-05T22:55:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Visuex	xiven , bah ...you guys have no sense of humour :)
2011-01-05T22:56:00.000Z	Visuex	BluesKaj	I do but sarcasm and such is really hard to detect in irc :)
2011-01-05T22:59:00.000Z	Visuex	BluesKaj	because xchat is awesome
2011-01-05T23:00:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Visuex	that's an exaggeration ..but you're entittled to be misinformed :)
2011-01-05T23:05:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Visuex	actually no , I konversation , but quassel has become very popular, so i thought I'd mention it ..konverstaion requires a lot of kde-libs which some gtk purists find offensive :)
2011-01-05T23:06:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Visuex	I use both actaully , but it can clutter the apps list/menus
2011-01-05T23:11:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Visuex	dropbox is great ..I've used it to share files with family
2011-01-05T23:11:00.000Z	Visuex	BluesKaj	maco if either of you are against xchat mind telling me why?
2011-01-05T23:11:00.000Z	Visuex	BluesKaj	agreed...love that program
2011-01-05T23:13:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Visuex	dunno , it's "clunky" , dunno how else to describe it , separate serverpages etc
2011-01-05T23:15:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Visuex	well I'm just used to konversation , it's easy to setup and has a simple interface
2011-01-05T23:16:00.000Z	Visuex	BluesKaj	maco I see well thank you for the info...I'm not a kde user so I may stick with xchat for a bit
2011-01-05T23:53:00.000Z	Visuex	BluesKaj	have fun
2011-01-06T00:00:00.000Z	Visuex	BluesKaj	maco just found a flaw for xchat...it stopped refreshing the chat for no reason
2011-01-06T21:08:00.000Z	Visuex	BluesKaj	there should be a good easy to compile process like launchpad or getdeb but more widely used so newbies dont feel so scared about using linux
2011-01-06T21:09:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Visuex	yeah I tried to find one , but as usual lately google-linux gets hijacked by irrelavancies
