2005-11-01T08:39:00.000Z	KinkoBlast		What;s a good "cheater" graphical CVS client for Ubuntu? I just need to DL source from a server w/o cvsweb or the like
2005-11-01T08:40:00.000Z	Chinstrap	KinkoBlast	if you are just doing a download, what do you need a gui for?
2005-11-01T08:40:00.000Z	KinkoBlast	Chinstrap	I have no f***ing clue how to use cvs.
2005-11-01T08:42:00.000Z	Chinstrap	KinkoBlast	what source are you trying to download?
2005-11-01T08:42:00.000Z	KinkoBlast	Chinstrap	monologo from anon.go-mono.org
2005-11-01T08:42:00.000Z	Chinstrap	KinkoBlast	more importantly, if you aren't capable of typing the cvs line I gave you to grab the source, are you going to be able to build it?
2005-11-01T08:43:00.000Z	KinkoBlast	Chinstrap	Yeh. I'v just never used CVS before. Outside of turtlecvs on windows.
2005-11-01T08:45:00.000Z	Chinstrap	KinkoBlast	last I checked, mono doesn't use cvs, they use svn
2005-11-01T08:48:00.000Z	Chinstrap	KinkoBlast	cvs -z3  -d :pserver:anonymous@anoncvs.go-mono.org:/mono co monoLOGO
2005-11-01T08:48:00.000Z	Chinstrap	KinkoBlast	but the cvs server seems to be down anyway
2005-11-01T08:50:00.000Z	Chinstrap	KinkoBlast	according to the website they did
2005-11-01T08:52:00.000Z	Chinstrap	KinkoBlast	svn co svn://svn.myrealbox.com/source/trunk/MonoLOGO
2005-11-01T08:53:00.000Z	Chinstrap	KinkoBlast	you might need to "sudo apt-get install subversion" first
2005-11-01T09:05:00.000Z	Chinstrap	KinkoBlast	CHange ROOT, basically jump into a directory and make that the new / for all further commands
2005-11-01T09:06:00.000Z	KinkoBlast	Chinstrap	Ah. Always wondered :-)
2005-11-01T09:06:00.000Z	Chinstrap	KinkoBlast	you know, 'man' exists for a reason :)
2005-11-01T09:06:00.000Z	KinkoBlast	Chinstrap	Eh, I have this lazyness thing....
2005-11-01T09:21:00.000Z	Chinstrap	KinkoBlast	I love C#.  Of course, I also love python, bash, php, postscript, objective-c, and I've been known to use perl, but it makes me feel dirty afterwards
