2006-06-01T11:26:00.000Z	ketsugi		This is weird
2006-06-01T11:26:00.000Z	ketsugi		Can anyone try to ping this address: http://dirt-.blogspot.com/
2006-06-01T11:26:00.000Z	ketsugi		I know there's a site there, but for some reason Firefox keeps giving me a 404
2006-06-01T11:27:00.000Z	ketsugi		yes, but then I get the wrong site.
2006-06-01T11:27:00.000Z	Bugs	ketsugi	unknown host
2006-06-01T11:27:00.000Z	ketsugi		Ubuntu doesn't seem to like the dash in the URL
2006-06-01T11:27:00.000Z	ketsugi		but it's a valid URL
2006-06-01T11:27:00.000Z	ketsugi		and there's a site there which I can't get to :/
2006-06-01T11:27:00.000Z	Bugs	ketsugi	 yes, remove the hypen and it works
2006-06-01T11:27:00.000Z	ketsugi	Bugs	but it's the wrong site
2006-06-01T11:28:00.000Z	ketsugi		that's someone else's blog
2006-06-01T11:28:00.000Z	ketsugi		dirt. and dirt-. are different sites
2006-06-01T11:28:00.000Z	Bugs	ketsugi	 try this:::: ping dirt.blogspot.com
2006-06-01T11:28:00.000Z	ketsugi		Yeah, if I do that I just get the blogspot IP
2006-06-01T11:28:00.000Z	ketsugi		if I try to ping dirt-. I get unknown host
2006-06-01T11:30:00.000Z	Bugs	ketsugi	 no, it does not seem to exist.  Only the dirt.blogspot comes up in my browser
2006-06-01T11:30:00.000Z	ketsugi	Bugs	that's the problem... Windows can handle that URL
2006-06-01T11:30:00.000Z	ketsugi		I'm trying to figure out why Ubuntu doesn't want to (or Debian, I guess)
2006-06-01T11:31:00.000Z	Bugs	ketsugi	Oh...well maybe windows resolves that URL into a proper URL ?
