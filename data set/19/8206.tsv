2007-05-16T08:46:00.000Z	effie_jayx		Hey has anyone installed ubuntu on a "compaq presario f5000" laptop
2007-05-16T08:47:00.000Z	Gerro	effie_jayx	what's the problem?
2007-05-16T08:48:00.000Z	Gerro	effie_jayx	put it into vga mode
2007-05-16T08:48:00.000Z	effie_jayx	Gerro	it is in vga mode
2007-05-16T08:48:00.000Z	Gerro	effie_jayx	you tried the f key option for vga?
2007-05-16T08:49:00.000Z	effie_jayx	Gerro	 the vga mode breaks
2007-05-16T08:49:00.000Z	Gerro	effie_jayx	hmm well mine is similar model only trouble I had was had to switch off wireless during live cd boot and use vga then after installed it I installed nvidia and blacklisted the broadcom driver
2007-05-16T08:50:00.000Z	Gerro	effie_jayx	which vga mode resolution are you using?
2007-05-16T08:50:00.000Z	Gerro	effie_jayx	does the cd check go alright?
2007-05-16T08:50:00.000Z	effie_jayx	Gerro	 1024X768 X32
2007-05-16T08:51:00.000Z	Gerro	effie_jayx	hmm try 800x600 if that is option it usually works
2007-05-16T08:51:00.000Z	Gerro	effie_jayx	if you install from alternate cd though you could boot up and press esc to enter recovery console and install nvidia
2007-05-16T08:51:00.000Z	effie_jayx	Gerro	I managed to install using safe graphics mode... but I couldn't get the installed system to start
2007-05-16T08:52:00.000Z	Gerro	effie_jayx	yeah it doesn't have safe graphics option so install through grub recovery console
2007-05-16T08:53:00.000Z	Gerro	effie_jayx	which processor does it use?
2007-05-16T08:53:00.000Z	effie_jayx	Gerro	 you suggest an alternate install? and whne do I isntall what how...
2007-05-16T08:53:00.000Z	effie_jayx	Gerro	 Amd Sempro 3400*
2007-05-16T08:54:00.000Z	Gerro	effie_jayx	start it up and press esc when you see it mention grub. choose use recovery console as root.
2007-05-16T08:56:00.000Z	effie_jayx	Gerro	 ok.. so I press etc and it says I am leaving the graphical boot menu and starting the text mode interface
