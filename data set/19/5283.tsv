2008-07-31T22:14:00.000Z	esh_	alraune	where do i enter that? how do i get to command line from install?
2008-07-31T22:19:00.000Z	esh_	alraune	i mean sorry
2008-07-31T22:20:00.000Z	esh_	alraune	i did but it said it wasnt a valid ubuntu cd, though it has to be to even get to installer menu. rebooted
2008-07-31T22:20:00.000Z	esh_	alraune	yeah says same thing again
2008-07-31T22:22:00.000Z	esh_	alraune	i cant eject the disc now
2008-07-31T22:22:00.000Z	esh_	alraune	gonna reburn but the drive im using doesnt always work correctly
2008-07-31T22:27:00.000Z	esh_	alraune	ok will check md5 and i use nero
2008-07-31T22:28:00.000Z	esh_	alraune	ok
2008-07-31T22:38:00.000Z	esh_	alraune	still happening. i installed xubunut a while back and had to set all_generic_ide to get it to install. could this be more of the same?
2008-07-31T22:39:00.000Z	alraune	esh_	if youre not even able to run the cd-check, its definetly something wrong with cd and/or drive
2008-07-31T22:41:00.000Z	alraune	esh_	if I got you right, you burned another cd, having the same prob ?
2008-07-31T22:41:00.000Z	esh_	alraune	yes, same thing. it must be drive then.
2008-07-31T22:42:00.000Z	alraune	esh_	or the burner, test iton another machine : check cd for defects...
2008-07-31T22:45:00.000Z	esh_	alraune	yes
2008-07-31T22:47:00.000Z	esh_	alraune	no i havent. i will do it later. i have an old cdrom somehwere that should work. its funny, i coulnt install windows with the old one, had to use the faulty one and now have to use old one to install linux. i think i remember having to do the same to get xubuntu to install
2008-07-31T22:48:00.000Z	esh_	alraune	ok. be back, need to boot with this machine.
2008-07-31T23:00:00.000Z	esh_	alraune	cd is fine, drive is problem.
2008-07-31T23:00:00.000Z	alraune	esh_	maybe use the burner for install then..
