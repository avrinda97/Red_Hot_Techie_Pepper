2011-04-01T04:06:00.000Z	AuroraX		How can i install GCC witthout having MAKE installed? Cuz i need MAKE to install GCC and vice versa :O
2011-04-01T04:07:00.000Z	maco	AuroraX	sudo apt-get install build-essential
2011-04-01T04:09:00.000Z	AuroraX	maco	will that work without having nor gcc nor make nor nothing (i have apt-get) installed?
2011-04-01T04:09:00.000Z	maco	AuroraX	yes, thats the *usual* way to get those things
2011-04-01T04:10:00.000Z	AuroraX	maco	thanks! it will be very useful :) my friend bought a sheevaplug PC and that bring a Debian for AMR processors that has nothing installed on it
2011-04-01T04:11:00.000Z	AuroraX	maco	build-essential or build-essentials?
2011-04-01T04:12:00.000Z	maco	AuroraX	singular
2011-04-01T04:13:00.000Z	AuroraX	maco	what?
2011-04-01T04:13:00.000Z	AuroraX	maco	ah ok
2011-04-01T04:13:00.000Z	AuroraX	maco	singular of "not plural" lol, sorry, my bad english xD Thanks
2011-04-01T04:14:00.000Z	AuroraX	maco	damn, i dont have wget installed LOL
2011-04-01T04:14:00.000Z	maco	AuroraX	is this ubuntu or something else?
2011-04-01T04:14:00.000Z	AuroraX	maco	Debian for ARM
2011-04-01T04:15:00.000Z	AuroraX	maco	i have it running on this: http://www.cyrius.com/debian/kirkwood/sheevaplug/gallery.html
2011-04-01T04:16:00.000Z	maco	AuroraX	hmm not sure. maybe want to try a debian channel?
2011-04-01T04:16:00.000Z	maco	AuroraX	i would think if you have apt-get you'd have some way for it to download things, such as wget..
2011-04-01T04:17:00.000Z	AuroraX	maco	apt-get asks me for wget LOL
2011-04-01T04:17:00.000Z	maco	AuroraX	ive never used the arm build of debian. i suggest #debian
2011-04-01T04:18:00.000Z	AuroraX	maco	yes, im gonna ask there, thanks, as soon as i get wget ill be able to install build-essential :)
