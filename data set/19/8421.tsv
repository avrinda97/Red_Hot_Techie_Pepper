2008-04-07T10:46:00.000Z	ouellettesr	amenado	yeah the cable works, i pulled it from a working computer, it must be the nics
2008-04-07T10:49:00.000Z	ouellettesr	amenado	yeah there is a pci, and onboard, i have tried both of them
2008-04-07T10:50:00.000Z	ouellettesr	amenado	it says no MII interfaces found
2008-04-07T10:51:00.000Z	ouellettesr	amenado	cwillu, eth0 100 Mbit, half duplex, no link
2008-04-07T10:52:00.000Z	ouellettesr	amenado	cwillu, if i unplug the cable from the pci and run that command again it says no-link
