2005-07-16T16:44:00.000Z	CarinArr		i have a desktop with two small hds and one big one, i have windows installed on one of the small ones and linux on the other. i want both of them to be able to read and write to the big hd.. what would be a good filesystem to make sure both windows and linux can access them without problems
2005-07-16T16:46:00.000Z	CarinArr		seveas, see that's what i'm using now on the big one, maybe i've not mounted it correctly.. cause i can read and write, i.e. i can do mkdir etc etc.. but if i try to say untar a file on the drive, or copy directories to that drive i get errors
