2012-01-22T18:00:00.000Z	mintman	LjL	what exactly does this command show????  ps aux | grep apt\|dpkg
2012-01-22T18:00:00.000Z	LjL	mintman	it should show every running process with a command line that contains the words "apt" or "dpkg"
2012-01-22T18:01:00.000Z	mintman	LjL	ok thats a new terminal command for me thanks...
2012-01-22T18:05:00.000Z	mintman	LjL	u couldnt simply reboot to stop locked dpkg package?
2012-01-22T18:05:00.000Z	LjL	mintman	i don't think so
2012-01-22T18:06:00.000Z	mintman	LjL	can u suggest what I can read to understand the process of the dpkg package??
2012-01-22T18:06:00.000Z	LjL	mintman	not sure what you mean
2012-01-22T18:07:00.000Z	mintman	LjL	never mind did a manpage to understand what the accornim stands for with dpkg
2012-01-22T18:10:00.000Z	mintman	LjL	thought we were to call a purge or a remove package to elimanate package problems?? why would the database lock?
2012-01-22T18:10:00.000Z	LjL	mintman	dpkg lock has nothing to do with purging or removing. dpkg lock is when dpkg is running, to stop other dpkg instances from running. if dpkg crashes, the lock stays.
2012-01-22T18:11:00.000Z	mintman	LjL	got u had this problem yrs ago with ubuntu
2012-02-04T17:59:00.000Z	mintman	LjL	ok
2012-02-04T17:59:00.000Z	LjL	mintman	he's gone. please keep this channel on-topic, discussing whether Windows or Ubuntu is better is not.
2012-03-06T23:49:00.000Z	LjL	mintman	do you have an actual Ubuntu support question?
2012-03-06T23:49:00.000Z	mintman	LjL	Already ran my past u and got no help.  So I will read and figure it out for my self
