2005-02-12T07:23:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	troll_god	kernel notifier for dbus
2005-02-12T14:17:00.000Z	troll_god	HrdwrBoB	Im told that but i don't understand what is so vital about python
2005-02-12T14:17:00.000Z	troll_god	HrdwrBoB	keep in mind im not really running ubuntu anymore, killed off init scripts and module overload etc
2005-02-12T14:17:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	troll_god	well then go for your life
2005-02-12T14:18:00.000Z	troll_god	HrdwrBoB	debian doesn't install pearl by default =/
2005-02-12T14:18:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	troll_god	er
2005-02-12T14:19:00.000Z	troll_god	HrdwrBoB	use the debian net inst, you get package selection and perl will not be installed by default
2005-02-12T14:20:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	troll_god	http://packages.debian.org/stable/base/ perl base syste
2005-02-12T14:21:00.000Z	troll_god	HrdwrBoB	This comp is debian; apt-cache show-pkg base-files | grep perl, nothing returns
2005-02-12T14:21:00.000Z	troll_god	HrdwrBoB	so becuase perl is in woody its in 'base'
2005-02-12T14:21:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	troll_god	perl-bae is in base
2005-02-12T14:22:00.000Z	troll_god	HrdwrBoB	perl is also in ubuntu's warty, its not a base package though
2005-02-12T14:22:00.000Z	troll_god	HrdwrBoB	no its not
2005-02-12T14:22:00.000Z	troll_god	HrdwrBoB	one again, 'apt-cache showpkg base-files | grep perl' does not return a package, there is no perl in debian base install
2005-02-12T14:24:00.000Z	troll_god	HrdwrBoB	Then whats 'base' its a meta package for base-files and base-passwd, with base-files being the system, and base-passwrd being encryption stuff
2005-02-12T14:26:00.000Z	troll_god	HrdwrBoB	... ? understand?
2005-02-12T14:27:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	troll_god	I'm not talking to you
2005-02-12T14:28:00.000Z	troll_god	HrdwrBoB	your a fucking idiot first you say im wrong, which im not *debian does not require perl* than you say im smoking crack, then you relise im right and rather than admiting to it you just drop the conversation, very elegant
