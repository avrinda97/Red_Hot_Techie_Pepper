2007-02-09T08:09:00.000Z	rohan		the !edgykernel issue was resolved ?
2007-02-09T08:10:00.000Z	jrib	rohan	not that I know of
2008-05-08T02:48:00.000Z	jrib	rohan	it's not about *ubuntu support*
2008-05-08T02:48:00.000Z	rohan	jrib	it most definitely is
2008-05-08T02:48:00.000Z	rohan	jrib	if i ask, "can i install ubuntu on machine foo", it classifies as support
2008-05-08T02:49:00.000Z	jrib	rohan	meh, what's your question exactly?  Thought you were with the hackintosh crowd
2008-05-08T02:49:00.000Z	rohan	jrib	no, i did not follow the flow properly
2009-07-15T18:28:00.000Z	rohan	jrib	doesn't help.
2009-07-15T18:28:00.000Z	jrib	rohan	noticed.
2009-07-15T18:32:00.000Z	jrib	rohan	no options then
2009-07-15T18:32:00.000Z	rohan	jrib	i can't remotely install over ssh?
2009-07-15T18:33:00.000Z	jrib	rohan	you need to reinstall
2009-07-15T18:33:00.000Z	rohan	jrib	yes, i want to do that. i know that downgrading isn't possible.
2009-07-15T18:34:00.000Z	jrib	rohan	it would probably be much easier to have physical access but there may be some option for you on that wiki page
2009-07-15T18:35:00.000Z	jrib	rohan	don't forget to setup ssh before loading the new install
2009-07-15T18:36:00.000Z	rohan	jrib	thanks
2009-07-15T18:37:00.000Z	jrib	rohan	18 months
2009-07-15T18:37:00.000Z	rohan	jrib	ok, ty
2010-11-09T20:15:00.000Z	jrib	rohan	best to just ask the channel your actual question (on a single line)
