2007-03-09T16:38:00.000Z	Viro	gyaresu	yep... ima do just that ;)
2007-03-09T16:30:00.000Z	gyaresu	Viro	/etc/inittab (default runlevel)
2007-03-09T16:30:00.000Z	Viro	gyaresu	default runlevel (2) starts x
2007-03-09T16:32:00.000Z	gyaresu	Viro	Yeah that's true... Used to be 5 in debian... Hmm. Good question. I want to know too. You could just 'update-rc.d stop X11 2' (off the top of my head)
2007-03-09T16:33:00.000Z	Viro	gyaresu	problem is, stating X kills the machine ;) I gotta avoid doing that so I can backup to a network drive
2007-03-09T16:34:00.000Z	gyaresu	Viro	Start up in single usermode (recovery mode) and do it from there?
2007-03-09T16:35:00.000Z	Viro	gyaresu	it's gonna work ..
2007-03-09T16:35:00.000Z	gyaresu	Viro	You think?
2007-03-09T16:36:00.000Z	Viro	gyaresu	I never think :)) hehe im backing it up but ther's still a lot of time left untill I dl the ubuntu DVD :)
2007-03-09T16:36:00.000Z	gyaresu	Viro	DVD? Why do that. You'll just need to update teh machine anyway?
2007-03-09T16:36:00.000Z	Viro	gyaresu	I don't have any install CD's
2007-03-09T16:37:00.000Z	Viro	gyaresu	gotta kill the box... I can't try to figure out what's wrong with my X
2007-03-09T16:37:00.000Z	gyaresu	Viro	So get the install cd not the dvd...
2007-03-09T16:37:00.000Z	Viro	gyaresu	Whats the difference?
2007-03-09T16:37:00.000Z	gyaresu	Viro	dvd has lot's and lot's of packages. Handy if you've got that disk and then want to install somewhere with no bandwidth.
2007-03-09T16:38:00.000Z	Viro	gyaresu	u might be right there... ima dl the DVD later :)
2007-03-09T16:38:00.000Z	gyaresu	Viro	Install cd just get's you up and then download all the packages you want from teh interweb.
2007-03-09T16:38:00.000Z	Viro	gyaresu	gotta dl the CD ... anyway :DDD
