2009-11-26T20:44:00.000Z	Ubee		How do I uninstall the unstable version of Google Chrome from my computer?
2009-11-26T20:44:00.000Z	zortec	Ubee	sudo apt-remove google-chrome or chrome whatever the package is called
2009-11-26T20:44:00.000Z	zortec	Ubee	or just use synpatic which would be easier
2009-11-26T20:48:00.000Z	zortec	Ubee	Did you look for the package in synaptic like I told you?
2009-11-26T20:48:00.000Z	zortec	Ubee	You can also search using "search" for the package name
2009-11-26T20:49:00.000Z	zortec	Ubee	Take a look at the installed packages in synaptic, open up your package manager
2009-11-26T20:49:00.000Z	zortec	Ubee	Let me get the name of the package, hold on please
2009-11-26T20:50:00.000Z	zortec	Ubee	Try sudo apt-remove chromium-browser
2009-11-26T20:51:00.000Z	zortec	Ubee	You need to use the terminal to do that, if you didn't know
2009-11-26T20:52:00.000Z	zortec	Ubee	command not found?
2009-11-26T20:53:00.000Z	zortec	Ubee	You are not typing the right thing... sudo apt-get remove chromium-browser
2009-11-26T20:53:00.000Z	zortec	Ubee	Sorry I left out the apt-get part
2009-11-26T20:54:00.000Z	zortec	Ubee	What is E?
2009-11-26T20:54:00.000Z	zortec	Ubee	 oh error... that was just what I thought the package name might be
2009-11-26T20:54:00.000Z	zortec	Ubee	you will need to search for the package name
2009-11-26T20:55:00.000Z	zortec	Ubee	Try apt-cache search chrome
2009-11-26T20:55:00.000Z	zortec	Ubee	apt-cache search chromium
2009-11-26T20:56:00.000Z	zortec	Ubee	Any luck on removing chrome?
2009-11-26T21:39:00.000Z	zortec	Ubee	there are other ways to see if you are online than type "test"
