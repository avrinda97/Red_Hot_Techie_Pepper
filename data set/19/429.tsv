2012-03-18T16:22:00.000Z	Aster		Hi.
2012-03-18T16:22:00.000Z	Aster		I get this error on my site when I try to open a file from a .php: Warning: fopen(Apples0.txt): failed to open stream: Permission denied in /var/www/Apples/index.php on line 49
2012-03-18T16:22:00.000Z	Aster		How would I give it permissions?
2012-03-18T16:24:00.000Z	Aster		Anyone?
2012-03-18T16:25:00.000Z	bluefrog	Aster	a good chance that your webhoster prohibits fopen
2012-03-18T16:26:00.000Z	Aster	bluefrog	I host the server.
2012-03-18T16:26:00.000Z	bluefrog		in your premises?
2012-03-18T16:26:00.000Z	Aster		No, it's in a datacenter, but I have full control over it.
2012-03-18T16:26:00.000Z	bluefrog		you have full control of what the datacenter allows you
2012-03-18T16:27:00.000Z	bluefrog		aster ask them about fopen
2012-03-18T16:27:00.000Z	Aster	bluefrog	I installed apache2 and php myself, it's not forbidden.
2012-03-18T16:27:00.000Z	bluefrog		or check that you have allow-url-fopen or something like this in inin.php
2012-03-18T16:27:00.000Z	bluefrog		ini
2012-03-18T16:27:00.000Z	Aster		I have root access and everything.
2012-03-18T16:27:00.000Z	Aster		Okay. Will do.
2012-03-18T16:27:00.000Z	bluefrog		aster not telling you installing apa or php is forbiden
2012-03-18T16:30:00.000Z	Aster		Bluefrog: It was already on: "allow_url_fopen = On"
2012-03-18T16:31:00.000Z	bluefrog	Aster	then ask your datacenter if there is something special with them with fopen
2012-03-18T16:32:00.000Z	Aster	bluefrog	I know fopen works, I have another page with fopen on the same server, I just need to know how to change file permissions.
