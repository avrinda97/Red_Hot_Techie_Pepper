2006-01-16T15:45:00.000Z	lapducky		Has mplayer been removed from the Breezy repositories?
2006-01-16T15:45:00.000Z	crimsun	lapducky	multiverse.
2006-01-16T15:46:00.000Z	lapducky	crimsun	I've got Multiverse, (and Universe) and none of the mplayer packages are showing up in apt-cache after I do apt-get update.
2006-01-24T10:37:00.000Z	crimsun	lapducky	with what, gdm?
2006-01-24T10:41:00.000Z	crimsun	lapducky	on Dapper?
2006-01-24T10:42:00.000Z	crimsun	lapducky	have you dist-upgraded in the last 30 minutes?
2006-01-24T10:43:00.000Z	lapducky	crimsun	yep.  I also tried rebooting and selecting  various 'recovery kernels' from the GRUB menu; yes I have done dist-upgrade recently (but more than a half hour ago).
2006-01-24T10:43:00.000Z	crimsun	lapducky	you need to update && dist-upgrade
2006-01-24T10:43:00.000Z	crimsun	lapducky	your /usr/X11R6/bin/X symlink is probably invalid; I was bitten by that, too.
2006-01-24T10:44:00.000Z	lapducky	crimsun	did the Dapper developers just commit spme dependency madness?  (I did apt-get dist-upgrade about an hour+1/4 ago)
2006-01-24T10:45:00.000Z	crimsun	lapducky	yes, we're breaking (and fixing) things left and right
2006-01-24T10:47:00.000Z	lapducky	crimsun	that looks wrong  -- is it?
2006-01-24T10:47:00.000Z	crimsun	lapducky	that's fine.
2006-01-24T10:47:00.000Z	crimsun	lapducky	the -commons are Replaced by x11-common
2006-01-24T10:48:00.000Z	lapducky	crimsun	are you migrating back to an XFree86 implementation of X11R6 or something??
2006-01-24T10:49:00.000Z	crimsun	lapducky	no, it's just a missing symlink update
2006-01-24T10:53:00.000Z	lapducky	crimsun	is there any automated 'diff-ish tool' to check the core files of the base section and major packages for file corruption?
2006-01-24T10:53:00.000Z	lapducky	crimsun	I mean something like a 'ckinstall' util.
2006-01-24T10:56:00.000Z	crimsun	lapducky	what do you mean by "core"?
