2006-10-28T16:01:00.000Z	DJAdmiral		People, please, help needed. Why does the 6.10 Alternate CD not let me resize 80 GB NTFS Partition so I can use 20 GB for Linux?
2006-10-28T16:01:00.000Z	pike_	DJAdmiral	try the burning the gparted livecd
2006-10-28T16:02:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	pike_	I have the Gparted live CD.
2006-10-28T16:02:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	pike_	But I'll also need to create a swap partition, correct?
2006-10-28T16:02:00.000Z	pike_	DJAdmiral	usually you do. if that is a problem you can create a swap file
2006-10-28T16:03:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	pike_	Then how much space should I give for swap file?
2006-10-28T16:03:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	pike_	I mean swap partition.
2006-10-28T16:03:00.000Z	pike_	DJAdmiral	for a newer system? i get away with 256 and rarely touch it
2006-10-28T16:04:00.000Z	pike_	DJAdmiral	if you have the space just make it same as ram
2006-10-28T16:06:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	pike_	So in Gparted, I shrink NTFS to like 57 or 58 GB, then make ext3 partition for 20 GB, then Swap for 1 GB?
2006-10-28T16:07:00.000Z	pike_	DJAdmiral	sounds good 1gb is more than enough
2006-10-28T16:07:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	pike_	Okay, cool. So should I go for ext2, or ext3?
2006-10-28T16:08:00.000Z	pike_	DJAdmiral	i would go with journaling ext3.
2006-10-28T16:08:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	pike_	Gotcha. So from 80 GB NTFS, go to 59 GB NTFS, then 1 GB Swap, then 1 GB ext3. Right?
2006-10-28T16:10:00.000Z	pike_	DJAdmiral	20GB ext3 for / would be simplest then 1GB for swap. alot of people like to make /home seperate too just for reinstalls and stuff but thats up to you
2006-10-28T16:11:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	pike_	Alright, then after partitioning with Gparted livecd, do I use 6.10 alternate CD, and it will let me install to this new ext3 partition?
2006-10-28T16:12:00.000Z	pike_	DJAdmiral	yeah you basically just select the partition and then tell it the mount point which would be / and then type ext3  and then type swap for swap
2006-10-28T16:12:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	pike_	Thank. You. So. Much.
2006-10-28T16:12:00.000Z	pike_	DJAdmiral	good luck :)
