2006-03-12T17:34:00.000Z	iGotNoTime		I do not have Ubuntu installed but have some easy questions prior to install....
2006-03-12T17:34:00.000Z	iGotNoTime		the Add Applications does the entire install?
2006-03-12T17:34:00.000Z	iGotNoTime		With a GUI?
2006-03-12T17:34:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	iGotNoTime	No.  You don't see that until the install is done.
2006-03-12T17:35:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	iGotNoTime	You don't need to know any console stuff for the install.
2006-03-12T17:35:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	iGotNoTime	It's not graphical and pretty, but pretty simple text menus, you just answer the questions.
2006-03-12T17:35:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	iGotNoTime	Correct.  But Gaim is installed by default.
2006-03-12T17:36:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	iGotNoTime	Add Applications will get you a lot of common things, and everything is available through Synaptic.
2006-03-12T17:36:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	iGotNoTime	No, unless you need to compile a driver or something.
2006-03-12T17:37:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	iGotNoTime	Even if you have to do command line, most things would be 'sudo apt-get install somecoolproggy'.
2006-03-12T17:37:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	iGotNoTime	I love it.  Straight from Windows XP into Hoary myself.
2006-03-12T17:38:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	iGotNoTime	Very easy, friendly community, great documentation, and you can sit back and watch it improve.
2006-03-12T17:40:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	iGotNoTime	Maybe.  I've heard reports that it works, but haven't tried.  Check out Nvu while you're at it though.
2006-03-12T17:41:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	iGotNoTime	Seems to be.  For other equivalent programs, see !alternative.
2006-03-12T17:41:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	iGotNoTime	Kubuntu comes with KDE, Ubuntu with Gnome.
2006-03-12T17:43:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	iGotNoTime	I personally, just for kicks, have Gnome, KDE, XFCE, IceWM, E, and some others all on the same box.
2006-03-12T17:43:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	iGotNoTime	Check some screenshots and see what you like.
2006-03-12T17:46:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	iGotNoTime	If you're looking for wasteful, why not go my route, install both, check one out for the first week, and the other for the second, and then choose?
2006-03-12T17:48:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	iGotNoTime	There are also many good reviews/comparisons of the two that Google can direct you too, but the best way is probably experiencing them.
