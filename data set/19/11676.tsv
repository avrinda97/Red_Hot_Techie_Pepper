2006-01-13T15:13:00.000Z	david_m_e		is there an "anonymous" or "guest" type user that can be activated so that i can log in to my linux box from an WinXp box without having to provide a user name and password?
2006-01-13T15:13:00.000Z	yatesy	david_m_e	no, linux actually tries to be secure :P
2006-01-13T15:13:00.000Z	david_m_e		did u see my earlier question?
2006-01-13T15:14:00.000Z	david_m_e		i have an XP computer and a Ubuntu/Samba computer; when on the XP computer, the "computers in this workgroup" shows both computers, but when i try to log on to the linux box from the XP box, i get rejected; when i try the net use command, it seems to try, but the username/password are rejected; where do i set up users to allow them to log in to a Linux box from  another machine (specifically, WinXP)
2006-01-13T15:14:00.000Z	yatesy		ah i see
2006-01-13T15:14:00.000Z	yatesy	david_m_e	create a user thats identical to your windows user
2006-01-13T15:15:00.000Z	yatesy		and set your samba password to the same as your windows user account
2006-01-13T15:15:00.000Z	yatesy		it won't ask for credentials then
2006-01-13T15:15:00.000Z	david_m_e	yatesy	where?
2006-01-13T15:15:00.000Z	yatesy	david_m_e	man smbpasswd
2006-01-13T15:15:00.000Z	david_m_e		thank you Dr Willis
2006-01-13T15:16:00.000Z	david_m_e		restarting samba requires logoff/logon or reboot?
2006-01-13T15:16:00.000Z	yatesy	david_m_e	no, just restart the service
2006-01-13T15:16:00.000Z	david_m_e		Dr Willis: i  will try the book again;
2006-01-13T15:16:00.000Z	david_m_e		i DID try the book; i assume u refer to the book on samba.org?
2006-01-13T15:17:00.000Z	david_m_e		however, this seems to be enuf info; i don't like asking questions without RTM'ng first, but i have been tryhing to figure this out for over a week now
2006-01-13T15:17:00.000Z	david_m_e		all help appreciated
2006-01-13T15:39:00.000Z	david_m_e	yatesy	after reviewing the saved text from earlier, i realized that i had forgotten to thank you - so, thanks - your info helped
2006-01-13T15:40:00.000Z	yatesy	david_m_e	lol no problem
