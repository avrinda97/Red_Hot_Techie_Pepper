2007-12-26T08:10:00.000Z	viper233	adante	: Yes... here
2007-12-26T08:13:00.000Z	viper233	adante	: maybe get hotkey-setup - auto-configures laptop hotkeys
2007-12-26T08:13:00.000Z	adante	viper233	hm but i don't want to configure them, i just want to know what they are
2007-12-26T08:14:00.000Z	adante	viper233	i understand there is probably a program to do that in the settings menu
2007-12-26T08:14:00.000Z	adante	viper233	ironically i can't get to the settings menu because i don't know the hotkey to get to it
2007-12-26T08:16:00.000Z	viper233	adante	: you got no mouse? Looking the System->Preferences->Keyboard Shortcuts   I don't see a shortcut to this menu.. What menu are you trying to see?
2007-12-26T08:18:00.000Z	adante	viper233	do not currently have a mouse no, and i did not know how to access the menu from the keyboard, so i could not actually achieve anything - but i know now
2007-12-26T08:20:00.000Z	viper233	adante	: ok... what is it? for future reference?
2007-12-26T08:20:00.000Z	viper233	adante	: Alt-F1 .. just saw
