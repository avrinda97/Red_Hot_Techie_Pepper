2007-05-21T12:45:00.000Z	NokiaN80		can any one answer me please? :)
2007-05-21T12:45:00.000Z	soundray	NokiaN80	you're not getting an answer because it's hard to tell what went wrong. Could you just try installing again?
2007-05-21T12:45:00.000Z	NokiaN80	soundray	I did it several times and I get the same error message.
2007-05-21T12:45:00.000Z	soundray	NokiaN80	at what point does it come up?
2007-05-21T12:45:00.000Z	NokiaN80	soundray	it is the first thing comes up after I choose "install Ubuntu"
2007-05-21T12:45:00.000Z	soundray	NokiaN80	have you tried burning another CD?
2007-05-21T12:45:00.000Z	soundray	NokiaN80	that's what I would do. Alternatively, do what Flannel suggests
2007-05-21T12:45:00.000Z	NokiaN80	soundray	I get another error message.. " Failed to start the X server ( your graphical interface).
2007-05-21T12:45:00.000Z	soundray	NokiaN80	choose Check CD for defects from the boot menu
2007-05-21T12:45:00.000Z	NokiaN80	soundray	ok.. hold on please
2007-05-21T12:54:00.000Z	soundray	NokiaN80	there you go. Your CD is faulty. You should run md5sum on the image you downloaded, and burn or redownload&burn depending on the result
2007-05-21T12:55:00.000Z	NokiaN80	soundray	So, I should now download another copy from Ubuntu.com and burn it again?
2007-05-21T12:56:00.000Z	soundray	NokiaN80	you don't have to if the md5sum on your existing downloaded .iso is correct
2007-05-21T12:56:00.000Z	NokiaN80	soundray	how do I know that is is correct?
2007-05-21T12:57:00.000Z	soundray	NokiaN80	on the page where you downloaded the .iso, there are also files listing the correct md5sums.
2007-05-21T12:57:00.000Z	NokiaN80	soundray	i see. i will check those
2007-05-21T13:00:00.000Z	NokiaN80	soundray	another question: I downloaded this copy from one of those torrent sites, I didn't download it directly from the site.. should I download the one in Ubuntu's site?
2007-05-21T13:01:00.000Z	soundray	NokiaN80	again, if the md5sum is good, then your torrent download is good, too.
2007-05-21T13:02:00.000Z	NokiaN80	soundray	ok, Thanks alot for your help.. I appreciate it :)
