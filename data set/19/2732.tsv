2012-10-09T05:49:00.000Z	Emanon		Is there any chance you guys could stop taking out the good posts of your OS? First you dropped Pidgin for Empathy which to be perfectly honest is lame. Now your shopping the alternate install disc so I can't set up with RAID or full disc encryption. What's going on?
2012-10-09T05:49:00.000Z	Emanon		Good parts*
2012-10-09T05:49:00.000Z	actionParsnip	Emanon	I use pidgin. I'm using it now
2012-10-09T05:50:00.000Z	actionParsnip	Emanon	its not dropped at all
2012-10-09T05:51:00.000Z	actionParsnip	Emanon	its even in the next release
2012-10-09T05:52:00.000Z	actionParsnip	Emanon	it is, you have the option to remove it
2012-10-09T05:52:00.000Z	actionParsnip	Emanon	think about it
2012-10-09T05:53:00.000Z	actionParsnip	Emanon	how so?
2012-10-09T05:53:00.000Z	actionParsnip	Emanon	its not a mandatory package, it can be removed. You have that option
2012-10-09T05:53:00.000Z	actionParsnip	Emanon	its not, i'm telling you how your OS works
2012-10-09T05:54:00.000Z	actionParsnip	Emanon	I hate firefox, but I remove it and promptly install the browser I prefer
2012-10-09T05:55:00.000Z	actionParsnip	Emanon	seems so http://news.softpedia.com/news/Canonical-Drops-Alternate-CDs-from-Ubuntu-12-10-289338.shtml
2012-10-09T05:56:00.000Z	actionParsnip	Emanon	Lubuntu has an alternate ISO
2012-10-09T05:56:00.000Z	actionParsnip	Emanon	but you knew that
2012-10-09T05:57:00.000Z	actionParsnip	Emanon	anything else you want to rant about?
2012-10-09T05:58:00.000Z	actionParsnip	Emanon	then install Unity as you wish, if the alternate ISO is SOOOO important to you
2012-10-09T05:58:00.000Z	Emanon	actionParsnip	do I know you from another channel?
2012-10-09T05:59:00.000Z	actionParsnip	Emanon	just here, I also #ubuntu+1 and #ubuntu-offtopic
2012-10-09T06:00:00.000Z	actionParsnip	Emanon	no idea what that even is, sorry
