2009-10-04T07:05:00.000Z	foey		I have ubuntu-server and normally use ssh to connect to gain access to the console. However I want to be able to access it at work, I`ve port forwarded port 22 to my linux box but keep getting connection refused? I works perfectly when I connect localy.
2009-10-04T07:06:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	foey	some ISP's block 22.. try using a non standard port.. like 2222
2009-10-04T07:07:00.000Z	foey	bastid_raZor	: Ok, I hoping to change isp soon. How can I change the listening ssh port via the terminal?
2009-10-04T07:08:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	foey	edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config and add Port 2222 below Port 22. it is near the top of the file. you'll see it
2009-10-04T07:09:00.000Z	foey	bastid_raZor	: Great help, thanks mate. ill try that.
2009-10-04T07:09:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	foey	you'll need to restart ssh before it will start listening on port 2222
2009-10-04T07:11:00.000Z	foey	bastid_raZor	: Ok added 2222. Whats the command for restarting the ssh server? sorry to ask :s
2009-10-04T07:12:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	foey	how are connecting from work? PuTTY or ssh ?
2009-10-04T07:12:00.000Z	foey	bastid_raZor	: PuTTy
2009-10-04T07:13:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	foey	okay, just specify the port change and you're all set.
2009-10-04T07:15:00.000Z	foey	bastid_raZor	: Still the same, I restarted ssh however I`ve got two windows open, locally and it didnt kick me out
2009-10-04T07:16:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	foey	2222 will need to be forwarded in the router
2009-10-04T07:16:00.000Z	foey	bastid_raZor	: I`ve just done that its forwarded to 10.0.0.2 (my linux box)
2009-10-04T07:18:00.000Z	foey	bastid_raZor	: Ok, i just tried connecting ot 2222 locally and it worked, but prompted me about a key which I said ok to. Could that be the problem as it remote?!
2009-10-04T07:22:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	foey	in PuTTY you changed the port to 2222?
2009-10-04T07:22:00.000Z	foey	bastid_raZor	: yeh, changed that too.
2009-10-04T07:24:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	foey	unsure from there .. souunds like all has been set correctly.
2009-10-04T07:24:00.000Z	foey	bastid_raZor	: yeh, ok, thanks for your help.
2009-10-04T07:25:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	foey	good luck.
