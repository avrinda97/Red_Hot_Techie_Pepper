2012-06-06T19:46:00.000Z	aartist		I cannot download multisystems.
2012-06-06T19:46:00.000Z	fidel	aartist	what do you mean by multisystems?
2012-06-06T19:47:00.000Z	aartist	fidel	allows multiboot : found here: http://www.pendrivelinux.com/multiboot-create-a-multiboot-usb-from-linux/
2012-06-06T19:48:00.000Z	fidel	aartist	try to describe the issue in detail you have. just mentioning doesnt work usuallydoesnt help that much
2012-06-06T19:53:00.000Z	fidel	aartist	so you are running a live cd right now - and wantto end up with what kind of setup?
2012-06-06T19:53:00.000Z	aartist	fidel	Yes.
2012-06-06T19:54:00.000Z	aartist	fidel	I like to get flash plugin, chromium-browser etc..
2012-06-06T19:54:00.000Z	fidel	aartist	no the first question is- do you plan to install any os - or just continue working with thelive-cd only?
2012-06-06T19:56:00.000Z	aartist	fidel	I like to install software and retain it.. whichever way I can do it.
2012-06-06T19:56:00.000Z	fidel	aartist	any chance you try to answer the question? ;)
2012-06-06T19:57:00.000Z	aartist	fidel	I like to install software and retain it.. whichever way I can do it.  Let it be with LiveCD or with Portable Hard-disk.. what should i do?
2012-06-06T19:58:00.000Z	fidel	aartist	personaly i would try to fix the real issue - replace the battery - check if i can access the harddrive and install any OS i want to use. then install additional software
2012-06-06T20:00:00.000Z	aartist	fidel	Thanks.. I can certainly take that route.
2012-06-06T20:00:00.000Z	fidel	aartist	so check if you can access your harddrive. then check if you want to restoresomething from it
2012-06-06T20:00:00.000Z	fidel	aartist	then care about battery - if possible
2012-06-06T20:01:00.000Z	fidel	aartist	andthen consider installing an os - or repair the existing one
2012-06-06T20:01:00.000Z	fidel	aartist	just continue asking if you have issues with those single steps
2012-06-06T20:08:00.000Z	aartist	fidel	great. thank you.
