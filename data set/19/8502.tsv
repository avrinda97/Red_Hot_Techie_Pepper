2007-05-26T13:16:00.000Z	jburd		So why can I not play VCDs?
2007-05-26T13:16:00.000Z	jburd		I tried introducing my family to ubuntu but they are getting disappointed.
2007-05-26T13:16:00.000Z	PurpZeY	jburd	Did you install all of the codecs? and libdvd?
2007-05-26T13:18:00.000Z	jburd	PurpZeY	yes.  libxine-extracodecs
2007-05-26T13:18:00.000Z	jburd	PurpZeY	the problem is not the codecs.  Ubuntu just doesn't mount VCDs.
2007-05-26T13:19:00.000Z	PurpZeY	jburd	It is definitely capable...beyond that I'm not really sure (personally) how to help.
2007-05-26T13:20:00.000Z	jburd	PurpZeY	well this is occurring at two places.
2007-05-26T13:20:00.000Z	PurpZeY	jburd	Did you install the gstreamer, and libdvd libs?
2007-05-26T13:20:00.000Z	jburd	PurpZeY	yes.
2007-05-26T13:48:00.000Z	jburd	PurpZeY	see that's the problem.  It just doesn't mount VCDs.
2007-05-26T13:49:00.000Z	PurpZeY	jburd	I don't know, but there are a lot of people around here that know a lot more than m.
2007-05-26T13:54:00.000Z	PurpZeY	jburd	From what I read there, it is possible, you have to make sure the app you are using will use the proper protocol for reading the disk.
2007-05-28T11:51:00.000Z	PurpZeY	jburd	On startup?
2007-05-28T11:51:00.000Z	jburd	PurpZeY	both startup and manual.
2007-05-28T11:52:00.000Z	PurpZeY	jburd	For start up System --> Apps --> Session add the command line
2007-05-28T11:52:00.000Z	PurpZeY	jburd	Then to run it, I am guessing, beagle
2007-05-28T11:52:00.000Z	jburd	PurpZeY	beagled --replace
2007-05-28T11:53:00.000Z	jburd	PurpZeY	it's already in there.  It's just that it doesn't start.
2007-05-28T11:53:00.000Z	PurpZeY	jburd	Oh, then I cannot help...as I do not know.
