2008-04-14T22:43:00.000Z	dts		my firefox doesn't start anymore. I reinstalled it in synaptic and deleted my .mozilla directory. What else could i do to reset it?
2008-04-14T22:44:00.000Z	noodlesgc	dts	open a terminal and type firefox and tell us what error message you get
2008-04-14T22:46:00.000Z	dts	noodlesgc	i did "firefox -safe-mode" and an initial screen came up asking me what to do and i clicked reset to defaults,etc. Then it asked me to restore session or to start new and i clicked new session. Then nothing happens
2008-04-14T22:46:00.000Z	noodlesgc	dts	try sudo dpkg-reconfigure firefox
2008-04-14T22:46:00.000Z	dts	noodlesgc	now it's just hanging there, no firefox opening
2008-04-14T22:48:00.000Z	dts	noodlesgc	no luck
2008-04-14T22:49:00.000Z	noodlesgc	dts	open gnome-terminal and look for any firefox processes and kill them
2008-04-14T22:49:00.000Z	noodlesgc	dts	i meant gnome-system-monitor
2008-04-14T22:49:00.000Z	dts	noodlesgc	did that already, restarted too
2008-04-14T22:50:00.000Z	noodlesgc	dts	is this the firefox from the repositories? are you on Hardy or Gutsy?
2008-04-14T22:51:00.000Z	dts	noodlesgc	yea it is, i'm on gutsy
2008-04-14T22:51:00.000Z	dts	noodlesgc	heh, just instaled firefox3

2008-04-14T22:52:00.000Z	noodlesgc	dts	so firefox3 from the repository?
2008-04-14T22:52:00.000Z	dts	noodlesgc	yea

2008-04-14T22:53:00.000Z	dts	noodlesgc	i had firefox 2 before, that was the broken one.
