2007-11-19T01:26:00.000Z	fo_x86		if I did chmod +x <Filename>.sh    and then tried executing ./<Filename>.sh    and I get  "bash: <Filename>.sh: command not found" what is wrong?
2007-11-19T01:26:00.000Z	nareshov	fo_x86	what does `grep "#!" filename.sh` say?
2007-11-19T01:27:00.000Z	fo_x86	nareshov	it says "bash: !": event not found
2007-11-19T01:27:00.000Z	nareshov		crap, wrong syntax
2007-11-19T01:27:00.000Z	nareshov	fo_x86	try '#!' instead of "#!"
2007-11-19T01:28:00.000Z	nareshov	fo_x86	`grep '#!' filename.sh`
2007-11-19T01:28:00.000Z	nareshov		hehe
2007-11-19T01:28:00.000Z	fo_x86	nareshov	it says " grep "grep "" <Filename>.sh"

2007-11-19T01:30:00.000Z	nareshov		hello
2007-11-19T01:30:00.000Z	fo_x86	nareshov	what does grep do?
2007-11-19T01:31:00.000Z	nareshov	fo_x86	can you open that file in an editor and look for a line that starts with #! and print that line here?
2007-11-19T01:31:00.000Z	nareshov		!es | pseudospy
2007-11-19T01:31:00.000Z	fo_x86	nareshov	it starts with #!/bin/tcsh
2007-11-19T01:31:00.000Z	nareshov	fo_x86	that's a BSD script :D
2007-11-19T01:32:00.000Z	nareshov	fo_x86	you could try installing tcsh :D
2007-11-19T01:33:00.000Z	nareshov		hehe
2007-11-19T01:33:00.000Z	fo_x86	nareshov	thanks
