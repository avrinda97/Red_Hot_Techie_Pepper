2010-05-29T21:49:00.000Z	new2linux		ssh is installed & wrking on lan; if I forward port 22 on my soho router, will my server be secure if I have a strong password?
2010-05-29T21:50:00.000Z	gt8	new2linux	you can change port 22 to another port to make it even more secure =)
2010-05-29T21:51:00.000Z	gt8	new2linux	but yes, a strong password may help.
2010-05-29T21:56:00.000Z	new2linux	gt8	thank you, do you recommend a port number to configure secure remote access; there is nothing on my new server, but lamp is installed and I want to configure the server securely and then be able to continue working on it remotely
2010-05-29T21:59:00.000Z	gt8	new2linux	any random one will do. you can edit it via /etc/ssh/sshd_config
2010-05-29T21:59:00.000Z	new2linux	gt8	is this necessary, my password is strong?
2010-05-29T22:00:00.000Z	gt8	new2linux	I recommend it. But no, not necessarily.
2010-05-29T22:00:00.000Z	new2linux	gt8	a hacker would have to know my username and password
2010-05-29T22:01:00.000Z	gt8	new2linux	yes, but obscuring the port makes it just that little bit harder too.
2010-05-29T22:01:00.000Z	gt8	new2linux	it's just my opinion, of course. You are free to do what you want.
2010-05-29T22:02:00.000Z	new2linux	gt8	cool , thank you; I am also going to configure remote management for my roouter/ firewall so that I can change settings remotely; again I will have a strong password; 8 characters upper & lowercase , numbers and special characters; router / firewall is a cheap, older consumer grade netgear device
2010-05-29T22:03:00.000Z	gt8	new2linux	8 characters ???
2010-05-29T22:03:00.000Z	gt8	new2linux	14 characters mate... :p At least
2010-05-29T22:04:00.000Z	new2linux	gt8	wow, I will never be able to remember or deal with a longer password; I have ran a checkk on my password and various apps say that it is strong; does that not mean anything? how could someone crack my password from the internet; how could they get my username?
2010-05-29T22:07:00.000Z	gt8	new2linux	ok, a "strong", humanly generated 8 character password consisting of a few upper and lower case letters, a couple of numbers and a special character or two approaches approximately only 100 billion combinations... ;)
2010-05-29T22:08:00.000Z	new2linux	gt8	so my 8 character paasword is ok then?
2010-05-29T22:09:00.000Z	gt8	new2linux	am just telling you facts. But it is of my opinion to use 14+. That is what I do in practice. If you are happy with yours, stick with it.
2010-05-29T22:10:00.000Z	new2linux	gt8	thank you
2010-05-29T22:11:00.000Z	new2linux	gt8	thanks again
