2009-12-02T04:42:00.000Z	Dasda		hey guys i have  a ebook that is a .exe and uses ebook viewer. I can open it under wine however when i click on chapters It does not open. I dunno what is wrong so I thought about extracting the .exe. However, I have had trouble extracting .exe. I've tried cabextract, p7zip and unshield
2009-12-02T04:43:00.000Z	squircle	Dasda	where did you get it from?
2009-12-02T04:43:00.000Z	Dasda	squircle	vgsports
2009-12-02T04:48:00.000Z	squircle	Dasda	if it's some obscure executable, try it in wine.... but i'm no expert
2009-12-02T04:48:00.000Z	Dasda	squircle	i ran it in wine. However it opens the home page of ebook. When i click on chapters then it does not load anything but a blank page
2009-12-02T04:49:00.000Z	squircle	Dasda	did it open in a browser or something?
2009-12-02T04:49:00.000Z	Dasda	squircle	no, it uses a app called ebook viewer
2009-12-02T04:49:00.000Z	squircle	Dasda	problem with "ebook viewer" is that it's very generic :P
2009-12-02T04:49:00.000Z	squircle	Dasda	what was the source again?
2009-12-02T04:50:00.000Z	Dasda	squircle	i would be happy by either viewing the book or extracting .exe to look at files
2009-12-02T04:50:00.000Z	squircle	Dasda	just a sec, i'm taking a look
2009-12-02T04:51:00.000Z	Dasda	squircle	want a link to the source? u can download and see it?
2009-12-02T04:51:00.000Z	squircle	Dasda	nah, i don't need it
2009-12-02T04:53:00.000Z	squircle	Dasda	it appears as though your ebook viewer program requires IE
2009-12-02T04:54:00.000Z	squircle	Dasda	what I would do is install ie6 and gecko using winetricks (http://wiki.winehq.org/winetricks)
2009-12-02T04:54:00.000Z	squircle	Dasda	yeah, what i said and what kostkon said are equivalent
2009-12-02T04:56:00.000Z	squircle	Dasda	what version of wine are you using?
2009-12-02T04:59:00.000Z	squircle	Dasda	yes.
2009-12-02T04:59:00.000Z	squircle	Dasda	they won't give you any help if you're running 1.0, it's soooo old
