2007-01-02T13:29:00.000Z	evildrummer		'couldnt find package' for 'apt-get install desktop'
2007-01-02T13:30:00.000Z	evildrummer		when I try 'apt-get install gnome' the whole error is: 'Package gnome is not available, but is referred to by another package, This may mean the package is missing or etc etc etc
2007-01-02T13:30:00.000Z	evildrummer		any ideas?
2007-01-02T13:32:00.000Z	evildrummer		at stefg im just trying to get a desktop environment for my ubuntu srver
2007-01-02T13:33:00.000Z	mwe	evildrummer	sudo aptitude install gnome works here. sudo aptitude install ubuntu-desktop will get some other stuff as well
2007-01-02T13:33:00.000Z	mwe	evildrummer	and I suggested two possibilities ;)
2007-01-02T13:36:00.000Z	evildrummer	mwe	I tried the first thing you suggested but it didnt work and the second command is still running
2007-01-02T13:36:00.000Z	mwe	evildrummer	yeah
2007-01-02T13:36:00.000Z	mwe	evildrummer	it will probably take a while to install
2007-01-02T13:36:00.000Z	mwe	evildrummer	are you running the latest ubuntu version?
2007-01-02T13:37:00.000Z	evildrummer	mwe	no 6.06
2007-01-02T13:37:00.000Z	mwe	evildrummer	it probably didn't work because you have not enabled universe
2007-01-02T13:37:00.000Z	evildrummer	mwe	What would you suggest? I have the 6.06 server disk and thats it
2007-01-02T13:38:00.000Z	mwe	evildrummer	the page ubotu suggested explains how to enable universe. go ahead and do that
2007-01-02T13:39:00.000Z	mwe	evildrummer	ubuntu-desktop is fine. just let it install but you will probably want to enable universe anyway
2007-01-02T13:39:00.000Z	evildrummer	mwe	Which page link was that?
2007-01-02T13:43:00.000Z	mwe	evildrummer	sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list. back it up first though, in case you screw it up
