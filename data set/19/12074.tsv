2005-10-15T08:13:00.000Z	dazzlindan		whats the best way to run resize2fs to let linux allocate the new free space from a resize of the partition table?  from a bootdisk?  resize2fs can only be ran on an unmounted filesystem.
2005-10-15T08:13:00.000Z	bob2	dazzlindan	if it's not the root partition, you can do it fro myour regular system
2005-10-15T08:13:00.000Z	bob2	dazzlindan	if it is, getting the live cd is probably the simplest solution
2005-10-15T08:14:00.000Z	dazzlindan	bob2	can i do it from a floppy disk?
2005-10-15T08:14:00.000Z	bob2	dazzlindan	yes, but not simply
2005-10-15T08:14:00.000Z	dazzlindan	bob2	why not simply?
2005-10-15T08:15:00.000Z	bob2	dazzlindan	do you know how to construct a linux boot disk containing parted?
2005-10-15T08:15:00.000Z	dazzlindan	bob2	no. do you know where a tutorial is?
2005-10-15T08:16:00.000Z	bob2	dazzlindan	no, I'd really just go with a live cd of some sort
2005-10-15T08:16:00.000Z	bob2	dazzlindan	or even use the ubuntu installer itself
2005-10-15T08:16:00.000Z	dazzlindan	bob2	thats what i was going to do, but i don't have the disk with me
2005-10-15T08:17:00.000Z	dazzlindan	bob2	i don't know if i made this clear... the partition is already resized.  i just need to run resize2fs on it to let linux reallocate it
2005-10-15T08:51:00.000Z	bob2	dazzlindan	because you didn't tell it what filesystem it is
2005-10-15T08:51:00.000Z	bob2	dazzlindan	-t vfat, probably
2005-10-15T08:51:00.000Z	dazzlindan	bob2	mount: /dev/fd0 is not a valid block device
2005-10-15T08:53:00.000Z	dazzlindan	bob2	mount: /dev/fd0 is not a valid block device
2005-10-15T08:54:00.000Z	bob2	dazzlindan	that means it thinks you don't have a floppy drive
2005-10-15T08:54:00.000Z	bob2	dazzlindan	perhaps the correct driver is't loaded
2005-10-15T08:55:00.000Z	dazzlindan	bob2	well i had just used it and thats what i don't understand
