2007-12-28T20:16:00.000Z	foo25	wols_	You want a copy of the interfaces file?
2007-12-28T20:01:00.000Z	wols_	foo25	/sbin/ifconfig -a
2007-12-28T20:01:00.000Z	wols_	foo25	what is there?
2007-12-28T20:02:00.000Z	foo25	wols_	eth0 and lo
2007-12-28T20:02:00.000Z	wols_	foo25	there is your answer
2007-12-28T20:04:00.000Z	foo25	wols_	What do I need to do with that then? (Sorry, haven't dealt with ifconfig much)
2007-12-28T20:04:00.000Z	wols_	foo25	have you a eth0 if you simply run "/sbin/ifconfig" with an assigned IP?
2007-12-28T20:05:00.000Z	foo25	wols_	I have eth0, but it's the wired connection I believe, and not connected, my wireless was eth1 previously, which isn't included in ifconfig whatsoever
2007-12-28T20:08:00.000Z	foo25	wols_	I don't even see it mentioned
2007-12-28T20:09:00.000Z	foo25	wols_	Sorry about that, wrong person
2007-12-28T20:09:00.000Z	wols_	foo25	then instead of "eth1" in what you wrote above, use "eth0"
2007-12-28T20:12:00.000Z	foo25	wols_	Use "eth0" where, sorry?
2007-12-28T20:13:00.000Z	foo25	wols_	Add that to /etc/network/interfaces?
2007-12-28T20:14:00.000Z	wols_	foo25	pastebin your interfaces file. it should already be there
2007-12-28T20:15:00.000Z	wols_	foo25	automatix?
2007-12-28T20:16:00.000Z	wols_	foo25	I want to know if you used automatix?
2007-12-28T20:17:00.000Z	foo25	wols_	No, not to my knowledge
2007-12-28T20:17:00.000Z	wols_	foo25	you said python script for your wlan card
2007-12-28T20:18:00.000Z	foo25	wols_	The one used here - http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=405990
