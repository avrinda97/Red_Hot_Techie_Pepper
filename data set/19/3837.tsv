2009-06-30T19:44:00.000Z	rkitect	stroyan	"unknown or non-unique volume type"
2009-06-30T19:44:00.000Z	stroyan	rkitect	I expected it would stick the the same story as mount told you ;-)
2009-06-30T19:45:00.000Z	rkitect		I had this mounted earlier today, any ideas why I would suddenly not be able to mount it or even get any information from the LV?
2009-06-30T19:45:00.000Z	stroyan	rkitect	It seems that you have the wrong lv or the one you have was damaged somehow.
2009-06-30T19:45:00.000Z	rkitect		power went out
2009-06-30T19:45:00.000Z	rkitect		would that damage an LV?
2009-06-30T19:46:00.000Z	stroyan	rkitect	A non-journaled filesystem might be damaged by a power failure.  But I wouldn't expect that to make it unrecognizable.
2009-06-30T19:47:00.000Z	stroyan	rkitect	The best way to hurt it like that is to write to the raw volume when you thought you were writing to a file/tape. :-(
2009-06-30T19:47:00.000Z	rkitect	stroyan	well, it's suposed to be ext3
2009-06-30T19:47:00.000Z	rkitect	stroyan	lol, yeah, I would have no reason to be doing that on this system
2009-06-30T19:47:00.000Z	stroyan		You could let fsck have a try at it.
2009-06-30T19:49:00.000Z	stroyan	rkitect	If you don't have current backups, then you should consider saving off an image of the volume before trying to rescue it with fsck.
2009-06-30T19:50:00.000Z	rkitect	stroyan	fsck returned ext2 but I'm getting bad superblock and magic number errors :(
2009-06-30T19:50:00.000Z	rkitect		man fsck
2009-06-30T19:50:00.000Z	rkitect		lol
2009-06-30T19:51:00.000Z	rkitect		wrong window :/
2009-06-30T19:55:00.000Z	stroyan	rkitect	You may get better behavior from fsck by using the option to specify and alternate superblock.  But figuring out where the alternate superblocks are is not as straightforward as I would like.
2009-06-30T19:56:00.000Z	rkitect	stroyan	agreed, I think I'm just going to suck it up for now and use another partition to accomplish what I need.
