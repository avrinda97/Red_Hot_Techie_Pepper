2010-09-21T03:04:00.000Z	nathan312	rbastic	that's the errors I am getting
2010-09-21T03:05:00.000Z	rbastic	nathan312	I'm no WINE expert, but my best guess is you need to 'cabextract' those DLLs into somewhere convenient.
2010-09-21T03:05:00.000Z	nathan312	rbastic	um, i'm a newb lol, what does that mean?
2010-09-21T03:06:00.000Z	rbastic	nathan312	sec, I'm googling :p
2010-09-21T03:06:00.000Z	nathan312	rbastic	ok lol thanks
2010-09-21T03:06:00.000Z	rbastic	nathan312	you need to install http://wiki.winehq.org/winetricks
2010-09-21T03:06:00.000Z	rbastic	nathan312	then probably run 'winetricks msxml3' and 'wine /path/to/setup.exe' at a Terminal
2010-09-21T03:07:00.000Z	rbastic	nathan312	http://appdb.winehq.org/appview.php?iVersionId=4992
2010-09-21T03:22:00.000Z	nathan312	rbastic	oh great lol
2010-09-21T03:22:00.000Z	rbastic	nathan312	yes, it looked quite arduous. i just installed msxml3 easily enough after following erUSUL's injstructions for installing winetricks
2010-09-21T03:23:00.000Z	nathan312	rbastic	that code you gave me just gave me a SLEW of errors lol
2010-09-21T03:24:00.000Z	nathan312	rbastic	yes
2010-09-21T03:25:00.000Z	rbastic	nathan312	you shouldn't have any problems installing msxml3 if you have wine and everything else installed
2010-09-21T03:25:00.000Z	nathan312	rbastic	i did what you guys told me lol...umm...lemme look
