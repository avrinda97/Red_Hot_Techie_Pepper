2010-07-23T09:24:00.000Z	^peanut^	gartral	can you ping your phone?
2010-07-23T09:25:00.000Z	gartral	^peanut^	yes
2010-07-23T09:25:00.000Z	^peanut^	gartral	can you access or telnet to port 8888 on your phone?
2010-07-23T09:25:00.000Z	gartral	^peanut^	no, theres no telnet server
2010-07-23T09:25:00.000Z	^peanut^	gartral	you don't need a telnet server to telnet to a port on a host.
2010-07-23T09:26:00.000Z	^peanut^	gartral	type: telnet 10.0.1.47 8888
2010-07-23T09:28:00.000Z	^peanut^	gartral	if the phone is running a webdav server, can you open firefox and type in the ip and port of your phone?
2010-07-23T09:28:00.000Z	gartral	^peanut^	yes, telnet connected, and i lied, appreaently the webdav server has a telnet backend up
2010-07-23T09:29:00.000Z	^peanut^	gartral	like http://10.0.1.47:8888
2010-07-23T09:29:00.000Z	^peanut^	gartral	=) cool
2010-07-23T09:29:00.000Z	gartral	^peanut^	yes, and it's asking me to authenticate
2010-07-23T09:29:00.000Z	^peanut^	gartral	ok cool are you able to logon?
2010-07-23T09:29:00.000Z	gartral	^peanut^	yes.
2010-07-23T09:30:00.000Z	^peanut^	gartral	if so, in the bookmark window try putting: http://username:password@10.0.1.47:8888 and see if that works
2010-07-23T09:30:00.000Z	^peanut^	gartral	put that in the "location (URI):
2010-07-23T09:31:00.000Z	^peanut^	gartral	if that doesn't work, hmm, then I'm not sure. maybe that's a bug
2010-07-23T09:31:00.000Z	gartral	^peanut^	well, it's giving me exactly the same error
2010-07-23T09:32:00.000Z	^peanut^	gartral	strange... the dev's might have missed a username/password field
2010-07-23T09:42:00.000Z	gartral	^peanut^	ok, i forgot to mention this: the normal webdav selection in the connect to server applet thing wont recognise my phone as webdav enable share
