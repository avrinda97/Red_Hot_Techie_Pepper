2009-04-28T04:37:00.000Z	duxbarak	mib_mmx8vt14	just a thought
2009-04-28T04:38:00.000Z	mib_mmx8vt14	duxbarak	bridge connection?
2009-04-28T04:39:00.000Z	duxbarak	mib_mmx8vt14	on the xp machine, it sounds like your bridging, right?
2009-04-28T04:40:00.000Z	mib_mmx8vt14	duxbarak	i have a wireless router that takes cabled connections too... i have always stuck in a cable wit a new ubuntu install , got the graphics and wireless drivers working and then connecrted only wirelessly
2009-04-28T04:41:00.000Z	duxbarak	mib_mmx8vt14	oh, ok, i thought you were bridging your connection through your xp machine, nm then
2009-04-28T04:41:00.000Z	mib_mmx8vt14	duxbarak	the xp machine has the internet connection which is shared t other machines thru the router
2009-04-28T04:42:00.000Z	duxbarak	mib_mmx8vt14	to ununtu machine connects to router which connects to xp machine, which connects to ...?
2009-04-28T04:42:00.000Z	duxbarak	mib_mmx8vt14	so*
2009-04-28T04:44:00.000Z	mib_mmx8vt14	duxbarak	the xp machine connects to th router... the router has inoputs for other machines or wireless for laptops
2009-04-28T04:44:00.000Z	duxbarak	mib_mmx8vt14	so router's uplink goes to your internet? or the xp machine connects directly to your internet and shares to router?
2009-04-28T04:45:00.000Z	mib_mmx8vt14	duxbarak	yes the xp connects directly and shares to router
2009-04-28T04:46:00.000Z	mib_mmx8vt14	duxbarak	on hovering over the network icon in the taskbar it shows quot eth0 active
2009-04-28T04:46:00.000Z	mib_mmx8vt14	duxbarak	i can even ping the xp machine
2009-04-28T04:47:00.000Z	duxbarak	mib_mmx8vt14	ok, i used to do that, i'm assuming that in the xp machine, you'll need a bridge between the connection to the internet, and the eth0 that connects to the router
2009-04-28T04:49:00.000Z	duxbarak	mib_mmx8vt14	if it's set up how i think it is, you need a network bridge.  highlight the two connections(internet and eth0 to router) in Network Connections, right click on one, and click bridge connections in menu
2009-04-28T04:50:00.000Z	duxbarak	mib_mmx8vt14	what kind of isp do you have?
2009-04-28T04:50:00.000Z	mib_mmx8vt14	duxbarak	very basic
2009-04-28T04:51:00.000Z	duxbarak	mib_mmx8vt14	dial-up? cable? dsl? t1?
