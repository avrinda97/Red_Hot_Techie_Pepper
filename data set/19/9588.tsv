2007-04-18T07:08:00.000Z	dsdg		halo, what document management system can i use that works under ubuntu, for architects sharing a lot of drawing files?
2007-04-18T07:09:00.000Z	variant	dsdg	you could try alfresco.. it's quite a nice cms. bit bulky though and needs a fairly fast server
2007-04-18T07:09:00.000Z	variant	dsdg	no ubuntu package for it though
2007-04-18T07:10:00.000Z	dsdg	variant	cool i have seen alfresco, havnt been able to get it working though, install, weird :) will keep trying,
2007-04-18T07:10:00.000Z	dsdg	variant	have you used it before?
2007-04-18T07:10:00.000Z	variant	dsdg	yeah, installed it for my employer
2007-04-18T07:11:00.000Z	dsdg	variant	and were you happy with it?
2007-04-18T07:11:00.000Z	variant	dsdg	works nice on a quad cpu xeon server with mysql
2007-04-18T07:11:00.000Z	variant	dsdg	so far.. not rolled it out yet. still in testing
2007-04-18T07:11:00.000Z	dsdg	variant	cool,

2007-04-18T07:12:00.000Z	dsdg	variant	lovely!
2007-04-18T07:12:00.000Z	variant	dsdg	the default hsql database is very slow compared to mysql on alfresco
2007-04-18T07:12:00.000Z	variant	dsdg	but mysql is easy to implement
2007-04-18T07:12:00.000Z	dsdg	variant	are you using tomcat, the boxed version that comes with alfresco?
2007-04-18T07:13:00.000Z	variant	dsdg	had a few problems with version 2 of alf.. we are working with 1.4 at the momment but might give 2.0 annother shot soon
2007-04-18T07:13:00.000Z	variant	dsdg	yes
