2006-02-20T12:15:00.000Z	Angel_Dex	MarcN	thats what im trying to install
2006-02-20T12:16:00.000Z	MarcN	Angel_Dex	try from the command line:          sudo apt-get install gnomekiss      and it will get the .deb and install it.
2006-02-20T12:16:00.000Z	MarcN	Angel_Dex	or use synaptic
2006-02-20T12:16:00.000Z	Angel_Dex	MarcN	i untarred it and it has a install .sh? text file and i ran it as a .exe but nothing happend
2006-02-20T12:17:00.000Z	MarcN	Angel_Dex	what I am saying is it may already be packaged up for you and ready to download if you check the ubuntu package repositories.  The way to do that is with the command line apt-cache or the GUI synaptic.
2006-02-20T12:17:00.000Z	MarcN	Angel_Dex	that means you won't have to mess with compiling from sources
2006-02-20T12:17:00.000Z	Angel_Dex	MarcN	there is and i just installed it many thanks DO you think that .sh did any harm?
2006-02-20T12:18:00.000Z	Angel_Dex		wastrel i think its a electronic paper doll for kids?
2006-02-20T12:18:00.000Z	MarcN	Angel_Dex	I doubt it.  Especially if you didn't to it with privileges (ie: sudo ./whatever.sh)
2006-02-20T12:18:00.000Z	Angel_Dex	MarcN	nope no privleges
2006-02-20T12:18:00.000Z	MarcN	Angel_Dex	then you are fine.
2006-02-20T12:18:00.000Z	Angel_Dex	MarcN	many thanks
