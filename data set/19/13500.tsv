2005-03-24T14:38:00.000Z	DarthFrog	shadeofgrey	If I were you, under those constraints, I'd say "Screw it" and use what's working now.
2005-03-24T14:40:00.000Z	DarthFrog	shadeofgrey	Then boot into Windows and get your job done!  Stop screwing around needlessly with software problems.
2005-03-24T14:47:00.000Z	DarthFrog	shadeofgrey	OpenOffice 2.0 is a beta.  I didn't see it available as a deb file, so it won't be apt-gettable.
2005-03-26T07:44:00.000Z	DarthFrog	shadeofgrey	apt-get remove -purge openoffice.org
2005-03-26T07:45:00.000Z	DarthFrog	shadeofgrey	apt-get install openoffice.org2  will install the beta of OpenOffice 2.   You left a minute early yesterday before I could tell you that. :-)
2005-03-26T08:17:00.000Z	DarthFrog	shadeofgrey	As I recall, you said you had a 175 page manuscript due tomorrow.  Why are you screwing around with new software?
2005-03-26T08:18:00.000Z	DarthFrog	shadeofgrey	Sorry to hear that.
2005-03-26T08:18:00.000Z	shadeofgrey	DarthFrog	 No...  i doubt you are...
2005-03-26T08:19:00.000Z	DarthFrog	shadeofgrey	??? Why?  I take no pleasure in the misfortunes of others.
2005-03-26T08:23:00.000Z	DarthFrog	shadeofgrey	Hey, it sucks to be you today.  But keep it off channel, please.
