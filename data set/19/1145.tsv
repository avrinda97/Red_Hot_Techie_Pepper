2011-05-15T11:45:00.000Z	Gskellig		NEF?

2011-05-15T11:46:00.000Z	Gskellig		i dont have start
2011-05-15T11:47:00.000Z	djr013	Gskellig	Have you tried GIMP? I don't know if it supports it, but it supports several formats.
2011-05-15T11:47:00.000Z	Gskellig	djr013	I'm looking to view a lot of pictures at once, rather than edit them
2011-05-15T11:47:00.000Z	Gskellig		i know gimp can convet to jpeg
2011-05-15T11:48:00.000Z	djr013	Gskellig	Oh, so like a photo previewer/collection sorter type thing? Not sure about that. I'd do a search on the format to see what Linux support it has, if at all.
2011-05-15T11:49:00.000Z	Gskellig		yes djr013, previewer/collection thing
2011-05-15T11:50:00.000Z	Gskellig		peddy, another way? I'm comfortable with simple commands =/
2011-05-15T11:50:00.000Z	Gskellig		ah
2011-05-15T11:50:00.000Z	Gskellig		what about viewing/organizing lots of NEF files
2011-05-15T11:51:00.000Z	Gskellig		if anybody is familiar with Irfanview on windows
2011-05-15T11:51:00.000Z	Gskellig		i'm looking for something like that
2011-05-15T11:51:00.000Z	Gskellig		"convert" is a built in ubuntu command?
2011-05-15T11:53:00.000Z	djr013	Gskellig	Well NEF is a raw image format, it would likely be better to convert it to something else anyway, to be honest.
