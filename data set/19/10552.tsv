2006-06-08T11:00:00.000Z	dr3wster		Does anybody have any ideas to help me with this stupid gnome settings daemon?!
2006-06-08T11:00:00.000Z	dr3wster		Sorry, it's really frustrating me
2006-06-08T11:01:00.000Z	dr3wster		is there an easy way to reinstall dapper over my current OS?
2006-06-08T11:02:00.000Z	chennaituxian	dr3wster	wipe off your OS and make a fresh install :D
2006-06-08T11:03:00.000Z	dr3wster	chennaituxian	but I'm dual booting with windows XP and my ubuntu's pretty well configured:-/.  Any better ideas?
2006-06-08T11:03:00.000Z	chennaituxian	dr3wster	why you want to reinstall ?
2006-06-08T11:03:00.000Z	dr3wster	chennaituxian	because I get an error about the "GNome settings daemon" every startup, it screws up my themes, and I can't run rhythmbox or azureus
2006-06-08T11:04:00.000Z	chennaituxian	dr3wster	delete ur gdm and reinstall it, why the entire distro ?
2006-06-08T11:04:00.000Z	dr3wster	chennaituxian	because I'm dumb:-p.  What's the best way to do that?
2006-06-08T11:05:00.000Z	chennaituxian	dr3wster	delete ur gnome package and reinstall that again
2006-06-08T11:05:00.000Z	dr3wster	chennaituxian	in synaptic?
2006-06-08T11:06:00.000Z	dr3wster	chennaituxian	well there are about 800 packages called "gnome" something or other in synaptic, but I don't see one that's just gnome
