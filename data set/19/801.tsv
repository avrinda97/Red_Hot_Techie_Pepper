2011-12-01T03:21:00.000Z	olividir		I am wondering, does anyone else feel like ubuntu 11.10 feel very heavy to run?
2011-12-01T03:22:00.000Z	olividir		multitasking is out of the question for me
2011-12-01T03:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	olividir	depends on the DE :)
2011-12-01T03:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	olividir	on low end hardware, use LXDE and you'll free up more resources for your apps
2011-12-01T03:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	olividir	not here
2011-12-01T03:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	olividir	or just install lxde :)
2012-01-13T18:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	olividir	start what?
2012-01-13T18:34:00.000Z	olividir	ActionParsnip	Samba
2012-01-13T18:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	olividir	to start the samba SERVICE, use: sudo service smbd start
2012-01-13T18:35:00.000Z	olividir	ActionParsnip	still says no such file or directory
2012-01-13T18:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	olividir	then run:  sudo apt-get install samba
2012-01-13T18:36:00.000Z	olividir	ActionParsnip	did that few times before getting on here
2012-01-13T18:37:00.000Z	olividir	ActionParsnip	I can find it if I go through dash home, it asks me for my password and then doesnt start
2012-01-13T18:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	olividir	use tab to complete the service name, may help
2012-01-13T18:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	olividir	didn't know you could manage services from dash
2012-01-13T18:37:00.000Z	olividir	ActionParsnip	Im trying to start it from dash
2012-01-13T18:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	olividir	use a terminal instead
