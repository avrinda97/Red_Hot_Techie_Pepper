2007-07-25T10:50:00.000Z	ThanatosDrive		Got a new problem today.
2007-07-25T10:51:00.000Z	ThanatosDrive		I'm trying to install an ATI Radeon 9500 128MB, and when I turn on the PC, X has troubles starting up.
2007-07-25T10:52:00.000Z	ThanatosDrive		Do I need to install drivers before adding in new hardware?
2007-07-25T10:52:00.000Z	crdlb	ThanatosDrive	what graphics card were you using?
2007-07-25T10:52:00.000Z	ThanatosDrive	crdlb	A Matrox Millenium Dual G450
2007-07-25T10:52:00.000Z	ThanatosDrive		The 'Dual'
2007-07-25T10:52:00.000Z	ThanatosDrive		The 'Dual
2007-07-25T10:52:00.000Z	ThanatosDrive		Gah
2007-07-25T10:53:00.000Z	crdlb		!xconfig | ThanatosDrive
2007-07-25T10:53:00.000Z	crdlb	ThanatosDrive	run the second command
2007-07-25T10:53:00.000Z	crdlb		with the -phigh, and choose the ati driver
2007-07-25T10:53:00.000Z	crdlb		that's the free driver that ships with ubuntu
2007-07-25T10:53:00.000Z	ThanatosDrive	crdlb	Should I run this with the Radoen in, or the Matrox?
2007-07-25T10:53:00.000Z	ThanatosDrive		Radeon*
2007-07-25T10:53:00.000Z	crdlb	ThanatosDrive	with the radeon in
2007-07-25T10:53:00.000Z	ThanatosDrive	crdlb	Okay, I'll give it a try.
2007-07-25T10:54:00.000Z	crdlb	ThanatosDrive	that works from the command line
2007-07-25T10:55:00.000Z	ThanatosDrive	crdlb	Wish me luck!
