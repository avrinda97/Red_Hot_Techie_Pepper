2007-12-12T22:36:00.000Z	pike_	sigma	yes
2007-12-12T22:37:00.000Z	sigma	pike_	is it really slow and buggy?
2007-12-12T22:37:00.000Z	pike_	sigma	i like it though the sytem req are not ideal but you can say that about alot of new python apps
2007-12-12T22:37:00.000Z	pike_	sigma	latest is suprisingly good only a few issues and it hasnt crashed on me but once in like 2 weeks
2007-12-12T22:37:00.000Z	sigma	pike_	wat r da sys requirements?
2007-12-12T22:37:00.000Z	pike_	sigma	not steep i have a 1.8ghz sempron and 512mb ram
2007-12-12T22:37:00.000Z	sigma	pike_	but is it really slow?
2007-12-12T22:38:00.000Z	pike_	sigma	no
2007-12-12T22:38:00.000Z	sigma	pike_	ah ok, is it a full multimedia solution?
2007-12-12T22:38:00.000Z	pike_	sigma	i really like it mostly even though its a little wierd on my fluxbox desktop. take a look at tvrss.net to show feeds to of weekly shows you can add em to miro but only the ones that are free of course ;p
2007-12-12T22:39:00.000Z	pike_	sigma	yeah. i like even the trailers and stuff it even includes youtube vids.
2007-12-12T22:40:00.000Z	pike_	sigma	alot of the complaints are pre 1.0 which i agree with but most have been address to some extent in latest
2007-12-12T22:40:00.000Z	sigma	pike_	im not worried about the downloadable content - im on a gprs line after all:) i just need a video + audio player in one and im on kde
2007-12-12T22:41:00.000Z	pike_	sigma	video its great audio.. ive not really used it for that but it should be ok if not quite rythmobx or whatever. what i really like are some of the net show feeds i think its the way media will move
2007-12-12T22:42:00.000Z	sigma	pike_	whats it lacking in the audio department?
2007-12-12T22:42:00.000Z	sigma	pike_	yeah when i get a dsl line, il look into that sort of content
2007-12-12T22:45:00.000Z	pike_	sigma	id recommend something else for audio but def give it a try
2007-12-12T22:45:00.000Z	sigma	pike_	i saw some screenshots, it looks really good
