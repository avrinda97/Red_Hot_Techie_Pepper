2009-09-26T14:24:00.000Z	ectospasm	siinz	normally those kinds of connections pass you through a proxy
2009-09-26T14:25:00.000Z	ectospasm	siinz	have you tried loading something up on the web browser?
2009-09-26T14:26:00.000Z	ectospasm	siinz	does your friend have to log into a proxy to get it working?  Like a network login page through the browser?
2009-09-26T14:27:00.000Z	ectospasm	siinz	it's probably your wireless driver then
2009-09-26T14:27:00.000Z	ectospasm	siinz	ndiswrapper usually gives poor results, you should use a native driver if available.
2009-09-26T14:27:00.000Z	ectospasm	siinz	shouldn't, I wouldn't think
2009-09-26T14:30:00.000Z	ectospasm	siinz	maybe the Jaunty driver
2009-09-26T14:31:00.000Z	ectospasm	siinz	at work I always have people up(or down)grade to the latest release, then file a bug report if you still can't get it working
2009-09-26T14:33:00.000Z	siinz	ectospasm	thanks for your help...ill give it a try and hopefully not have to come back for the same issue
