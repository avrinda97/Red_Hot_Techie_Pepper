2011-03-07T19:23:00.000Z	Morten_		Is there anything to do about the poor rendering of .png pictures in a .pdf file using Evince?
2011-03-07T19:24:00.000Z	coz_	Morten_	 not sure ... but it doesnt seem to be poor rendering on this end
2011-03-07T19:24:00.000Z	Morten_	coz_	which version do you have?
2011-03-07T19:24:00.000Z	coz_	Morten_	 are they your images or ones that cam with the pdf
2011-03-07T19:25:00.000Z	coz_	Morten_	  2.3.0.3
2011-03-07T19:25:00.000Z	coz_	Morten_	2.30.3
2011-03-07T19:25:00.000Z	Morten_	coz_	they are my images, and they look fine in okular.
2011-03-07T19:25:00.000Z	coz_	Morten_	 ah  mm  what resolution did you save them as  and how did you create the pdf?
2011-03-07T19:25:00.000Z	Morten_	coz_	ah ok, perhaps I should update.
2011-03-07T19:27:00.000Z	Morten_	coz_	hmm, they are 796*572
2011-03-07T19:28:00.000Z	coz_	Morten_	 what about DPI
2011-03-07T19:28:00.000Z	coz_	Morten_	 generall I use inkscape to create pdf files and set DPI either at 300 dpi  or 600dpi
2011-03-07T19:29:00.000Z	coz_	Morten_	 this way regardless of printed size both images and text should be near flawless
2011-03-07T19:29:00.000Z	Morten_	coz_	I don't know the DPI, I get the images from the program, root.. Is there a way to check it?
2011-03-07T19:29:00.000Z	Morten_	coz_	well, it looks fine when I print it.
2011-03-07T19:30:00.000Z	coz_	Morten_	 oh ok  let me check on testing dpi hold on
2011-03-07T19:30:00.000Z	Morten_	coz_	and in other pdf-viewers
2011-03-07T19:31:00.000Z	coz_	Morten_	 interesting that evince is doing this... although I find okluar nice but a bit much for my needs
2011-03-07T19:32:00.000Z	Morten_	coz_	yeah, it very strange and kinda irritating. Okular is too bloated somehow, and I like evince.
