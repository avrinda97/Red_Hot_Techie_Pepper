2008-02-22T15:21:00.000Z	sofiankrt		I can't scroll down with my arrow keys in ubuntu!
2008-02-22T15:21:00.000Z	sofiankrt		firfox
2008-02-22T15:21:00.000Z	sofiankrt		firefox, not ubuntu
2008-02-22T15:22:00.000Z	Cromag	sofiankrt	try click on the background ind ubuntu and get the mouse away from a picture.
2008-02-22T15:22:00.000Z	Cromag	sofiankrt	and then try again
2008-02-22T15:26:00.000Z	sofiankrt	Cromag	no, still not working
2008-02-22T15:26:00.000Z	sofiankrt	Cromag	it just goes to the end of the page
2008-02-22T15:26:00.000Z	Cromag	sofiankrt	like "home" ?
2008-02-22T15:26:00.000Z	Cromag	sofiankrt	sorry, "end"
2008-02-22T15:28:00.000Z	sofiankrt	Cromag	?
2008-02-22T15:28:00.000Z	sofiankrt	Cromag	What do you think is the cause of the problem
2008-02-22T15:29:00.000Z	Cromag	sofiankrt	i could think that the key is mistakenly binded as an "end" key - but how about the "up" key ?
2008-02-22T15:29:00.000Z	Cromag	sofiankrt	does that work as inteded ?
2008-02-22T15:30:00.000Z	sofiankrt	Cromag	kind of
2008-02-22T15:30:00.000Z	sofiankrt	Cromag	I suppose it does
2008-02-22T15:31:00.000Z	Cromag	sofiankrt	it doesnt go to the top when you are at the bottom ?
2008-02-22T15:31:00.000Z	sofiankrt	Cromag	it does
2008-02-22T15:33:00.000Z	Cromag	sofiankrt	ok, so both keys are failing, somehow. Sounds either like a key mistaken as Home and end or some settings in firefox telling what the key should do.
