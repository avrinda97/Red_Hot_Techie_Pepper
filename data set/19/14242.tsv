2004-10-11T08:20:00.000Z	leonv		what drivers can I use to get nvidia support in X?
2004-10-11T08:20:00.000Z	rburton	leonv	install nvidia-glx
2004-10-11T08:21:00.000Z	leonv	rburton	I had a look but it is not available as an app: feta available nvidia , and it is not there (in my source.list file I have universe and restricted)
2004-10-11T08:23:00.000Z	rburton	leonv	its in restricted for me
2004-10-11T08:23:00.000Z	leonv	rburton	how do you check that?
2004-10-11T08:23:00.000Z	rburton	leonv	apt-cache policy nvidia-glx
2004-10-11T08:23:00.000Z	rburton	leonv	but it was in synaptic if you want to do it the Ubuntu Way
2004-10-11T08:24:00.000Z	leonv	rburton	when I do a apt-cache policy nvidia-glx it comes back with Installed: (none), Candidate: (none), odd?
2004-10-11T08:25:00.000Z	rburton	leonv	when you added restricted to your sources.list, did you apt-get update?
2004-10-11T08:25:00.000Z	leonv	rburton	yepp ...
2004-10-11T08:31:00.000Z	leonv	rburton	when I check on http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/restricted/n/ only two packages nvidia-kernel-common nvidia-settings, you using another mirror?
2004-10-11T08:32:00.000Z	rburton	leonv	my apt line is deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ warty main restricted universe
2004-10-11T08:32:00.000Z	rburton	leonv	http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/restricted/l/linux-restricted-modules-2.6.8.1/
2004-10-11T08:33:00.000Z	leonv	rburton	one thing I didn't mention, I am running on an AMD64-bit, could that make a diff?
2004-10-11T08:33:00.000Z	rburton	leonv	yes. nvidial-glx is only for i386
2004-10-11T08:34:00.000Z	rburton	leonv	i presume someone is working on integrating the amd64 drivers
2004-10-11T08:34:00.000Z	leonv	rburton	mm, can one run the nvidia stuff from a changed root environement using something like dchroot?
2004-10-11T08:35:00.000Z	rburton	leonv	the main part is a kernel module
2004-10-11T08:36:00.000Z	leonv	rburton	I presume the nvidia drivers would imporve the X interface with a nVidia Corporation NV34 [GeForce FX 5200]  card
