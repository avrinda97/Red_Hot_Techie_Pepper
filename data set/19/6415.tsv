2012-08-13T22:05:00.000Z	histo	n00b	it's two commands on one line
2012-08-13T22:05:00.000Z	histo	n00b	you would nee dto sudo /etc/init.d/cupsys stop && sudo /etc/init.d/cupsys start
2012-08-13T22:06:00.000Z	histo	n00b	do you have cups installed?
2012-08-13T22:07:00.000Z	histo	n00b	try sudo /etc/init.d/cups stop
2012-08-13T22:07:00.000Z	histo	n00b	and sudo /etc/init.d/cups start
2012-08-13T22:08:00.000Z	histo	n00b	because its cups not cupsys
2012-08-13T22:08:00.000Z	histo	n00b	if you would look at what I typed
2012-08-13T22:08:00.000Z	histo	n00b	sudo /etc/init.d/cups stop  <---------------------
2012-08-13T22:08:00.000Z	histo	n00b	well the page is wrong. It's not official documentation anyways
