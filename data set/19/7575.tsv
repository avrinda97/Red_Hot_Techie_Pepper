2007-07-31T09:25:00.000Z	series		anyone available to help?
2007-07-31T09:26:00.000Z	series		new to ubuntu....went into the users menu and changed my like...home directory i guess to root and now it wont let me login >.>  gives me errors.  anyway to correct via terminal?
2007-07-31T09:27:00.000Z	hendrixski	series	 :-) wanting to be root is a common mistake for new users.  :-) don't worry, it can probably be fixed
2007-07-31T09:28:00.000Z	hendrixski	series	so it won't let you log in... but does a black screen with white letters come up?
2007-07-31T09:28:00.000Z	series	hendrixski	-- i can get into the terminal if thats what u are asking...its just when the gui tried to launch it posts errors and kicks me out
2007-07-31T09:29:00.000Z	hendrixski	series	Ok.  So when you're in the terminal which directory are you in?  you can type in pwd to find out :-)
2007-07-31T09:33:00.000Z	series	hendrixski	-- it says im in /root
2007-07-31T09:34:00.000Z	hendrixski	series	oh... I think this could be an easy one... you're not allowed to log into the GUI as root... Ubuntu does that for your protection
2007-07-31T09:34:00.000Z	hendrixski	series	so you probably need to create a new user
2007-07-31T09:35:00.000Z	hendrixski	series	though... here's a dirty trick... that you must promise me you'll forget.... type in startx and it *will* get you into the graphical frontend as root.  then create a new user, add them to the "sudoers" group, and log out of root, then log back in as that user :-)
2007-07-31T09:36:00.000Z	hendrixski	series	you think you got that?  'cause I have to leave in like a minute or two
2007-07-31T09:36:00.000Z	series	hendrixski	-- ok...well the reason i wanted to be root in the first place was to install nvidia drivers....it kept telling me when i ran it that it had to be run out of root....how would i go about that without doing what i did...haha
2007-07-31T09:37:00.000Z	hendrixski	series	:-) you don't have to _BE_ root, all you need are root priveledges... which you can do from sudo
2007-07-31T09:38:00.000Z	hendrixski	series	for example  "sudo make install nVidia-drivers" will run that command with root priveledges, but you're not logged in as root
2007-07-31T09:38:00.000Z	series	hendrixski	-- ok i think i understand....thanks
2007-07-31T09:38:00.000Z	hendrixski	series	because being logged in as root is dangerous :-( and everyone here will tell you the same thing: don't do it
2007-07-31T09:39:00.000Z	hendrixski	series	  :-) hope that helps... I gotta go.  Good luck, and welcome to Ubuntu..  I'm sure you'll LOVE it... we've all made those kinds of mistakes, but the end goal is all worth it
2007-07-31T12:37:00.000Z	series	hendrixski	 got a minute? :p
2007-07-31T12:37:00.000Z	hendrixski	series	I was kind of hoping to get a questions answered myslef, buut yes, I have a minute
