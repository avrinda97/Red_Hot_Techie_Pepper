2010-02-25T03:13:00.000Z	Dimitar		Yes, gnome.
2010-02-25T03:14:00.000Z	Dimitar		Well, the problem is that I can't access the gui.
2010-02-25T03:14:00.000Z	Dimitar		When I boot up, I get a black screen.
2010-02-25T03:14:00.000Z	Dimitar		Yes, Karmic.
2010-02-25T03:14:00.000Z	Dimitar		And I also get a loading cursor which is responsive.
2010-02-25T03:14:00.000Z	Dimitar		And I get prompted for a keyring.
2010-02-25T03:14:00.000Z	Dimitar		But nothing else loads.
2010-02-25T03:15:00.000Z	Dimitar		Yes it is.
2010-02-25T03:15:00.000Z	Dimitar		I'm running on an nForce 630m chipset.
2010-02-25T03:15:00.000Z	Dimitar		And I did try to config xorg.
2010-02-25T03:15:00.000Z	fernandoc1	Dimitar	have you installed the official nvidia drivers?
2010-02-25T03:15:00.000Z	Dimitar		But the only thing I changed was the driver to use "vesa" instead of "nvidia".
2010-02-25T03:15:00.000Z	Dimitar		I had done so, yes.
2010-02-25T03:16:00.000Z	Dimitar		And they worked for a month or so.
2010-02-25T03:16:00.000Z	fernandoc1		Then you should reinstall the drivers
2010-02-25T03:16:00.000Z	fernandoc1		via command line
2010-02-25T03:16:00.000Z	Dimitar		Yeah, I gave the update manager the go-ahead last night.
2010-02-25T03:16:00.000Z	Dimitar		And I only glimpsed over the updates.
2010-02-25T03:17:00.000Z	Dimitar	fernandoc1	that was my original question. How would I reinstall the drivers via commandline?
