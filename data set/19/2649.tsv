2010-03-11T02:02:00.000Z	JLove		Can anybody help me with a mounting issue?
2010-03-11T02:04:00.000Z	JLove		I've got a second harddrive and it seems to mount to a directory in /media with a random series of number. I've tried looking in /etc/fstab but I can't see an entry for this dirve, does anybody know where the command to mount this filesystem is?
2010-03-11T02:05:00.000Z	mhall119|work	JLove	it's udev doing the mounting
2010-03-11T02:06:00.000Z	JLove	mhall119|work	I want to be able to mount this filesystem into my home directory to a folder called "videos" as my main filesystem is too small, could you help me though this?
2010-03-11T02:06:00.000Z	mhall119|work	JLove	sure
2010-03-11T02:06:00.000Z	mhall119|work	JLove	this is a USB drive or something?
2010-03-11T02:07:00.000Z	JLove	mhall119|work	No it's a second hd connected to my IDE controller
2010-03-11T02:07:00.000Z	mhall119|work	JLove	okay, /dev/sdb1?
2010-03-11T02:07:00.000Z	JLove	mhall119|work	Correct
2010-03-11T02:08:00.000Z	mhall119|work	JLove	do you already have a /home/JLove/Videos?
2010-03-11T02:08:00.000Z	JLove	mhall119|work	I do, yes, would it be possible to extend this or should i create a second mount point?
2010-03-11T02:08:00.000Z	mhall119|work	JLove	probably easiest to create a second mount point
2010-03-11T02:09:00.000Z	mhall119|work	JLove	anyway, this is what you'll do: "sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /home/JLove/mountpoint"
2010-03-11T02:09:00.000Z	JLove	mhall119|work	ok i've created a second directory "videos2" where now?
2010-03-11T02:10:00.000Z	JLove	mhall119|work	how do i stop the harddrice mounting to /media/32423423423 where is this configured?
2010-03-11T02:10:00.000Z	mhall119|work	JLove	that I'm not sure about, but you can run "sudo umount /media/32423423423" to unmount it
2010-03-11T02:11:00.000Z	JLove	mhall119|work	should i look into udev?
2010-03-11T02:11:00.000Z	mhall119|work	JLove	you can, but it gets pretty technical
2010-03-11T02:12:00.000Z	JLove	mhall119|work	Okay, I'll try adding it to fstab and hope it overrides whatever else is mounting it:-) thanks for your help!!
