2008-02-13T22:50:00.000Z	UbuntuLearner		most m4a files.
2008-02-13T22:51:00.000Z	bazhang	UbuntuLearner	on your windows and mac machine with iTunes it is perfectly legal and aboveboard to strip the drm
2008-02-13T22:52:00.000Z	UbuntuLearner	bazhang	but I formated my windows installation, and all drm strippers need the licenses to strip them.
2008-02-13T22:53:00.000Z	bazhang	UbuntuLearner	get them back and then do it--iTunes has a record of all that
