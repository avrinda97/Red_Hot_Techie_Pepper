2008-09-15T16:57:00.000Z	Fused		libmpeg2 is what it's attempting to use to play the videos. What would be used in it's place? Anyone?
2008-09-15T16:58:00.000Z	Ziroday	Fused	use vlc player
2008-09-15T16:59:00.000Z	Fused	Ziroday	The only reason I'm not using VLC is because the video is scrambled in it, too.
2008-09-15T16:59:00.000Z	Fused	Ziroday	Also, the buffer keeps making the audio skip.
2008-09-15T17:00:00.000Z	Ziroday	Fused	what format?
2008-09-15T17:00:00.000Z	Fused	Ziroday	It tried to use the mpeg2 software, but I'm not sure what format the disk is. It's a DVD.
2008-09-15T17:01:00.000Z	Fused	Ziroday	That's as much as I can tell you right now, because it won't open it long enough to show any file information.
2008-09-15T17:01:00.000Z	Ziroday	Fused	hmm, have you got all the dvd codecs installed?
2008-09-15T17:03:00.000Z	Fused	Ziroday	I have all of the DVD codecs that I could find installed.
2008-09-15T17:04:00.000Z	Ziroday	Fused	hmm, I really don't know. Tried mplayer or rip the dvds to your harddrive and see if the issue is there
2008-09-15T17:17:00.000Z	Fused	Ziroday	Thanks for the help, but I finally figured out what was wrong.
2008-09-15T17:17:00.000Z	Ziroday	Fused	what was it?
2008-09-15T17:18:00.000Z	Ziroday	Fused	asked you if you had all the libraries installed :)
2008-09-15T17:19:00.000Z	Fused	Ziroday	libdvdcss never came up in the package manager, so I didn't know where it was.
2008-09-15T17:19:00.000Z	Fused	Ziroday	Had to search around a bit.
2008-09-15T17:19:00.000Z	Ziroday	Fused	you can just install ubuntu-restriced-extras iirc that installs libdvdcss2
2008-09-15T17:19:00.000Z	Fused	Ziroday	I already had that installed, and it still wouldn't work.
2008-09-15T17:20:00.000Z	Ziroday	Fused	hmm, thats odd thanks
2008-09-15T17:21:00.000Z	Fused	Ziroday	No problem. Thanks again, bye.
