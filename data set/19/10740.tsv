2006-05-27T14:05:00.000Z	Tonren	twibbler	is it HP?
2006-05-27T14:06:00.000Z	twibbler	Tonren	Nope a canon, with good documentation but it wont work.
2006-05-27T14:07:00.000Z	twibbler	Tonren	the problem is Im using a docking station, and laptop seems to be some sort of coms problem somewhere. Ive installed driver followed all ins, it finds it on lsusb but wont print the test page goes into the balck holw.
2006-05-27T14:08:00.000Z	Tonren	twibbler	bizarre... is there a working print monitor/manager software that installed w/ the driver?
2006-05-27T14:09:00.000Z	twibbler	Tonren	nope it says use the admin print configuration tool to setup printer.
2006-05-27T14:09:00.000Z	twibbler	Tonren	and the driver is there.
2006-05-27T14:09:00.000Z	Tonren	twibbler	if you do print-admin list or whatever the equivalent is, does the job show up?
2006-05-27T14:10:00.000Z	twibbler	Tonren	yes and the little printer top right and it is there printer stopped, or it is there and goes but doesn't print.
2006-05-27T14:11:00.000Z	twibbler	Tonren	Arrrrrggggggghhhhhhhh
2006-05-27T14:15:00.000Z	twibbler	Tonren	Any ideas please.
2006-05-27T14:15:00.000Z	Tonren	twibbler	sorry, man... drivers definitely are not my thing.
2006-05-27T14:16:00.000Z	twibbler	Tonren	thanks anyway Im going to go and throw the laptop of a cliff.
2006-05-27T14:16:00.000Z	Tonren	twibbler	hahaha, i wouldn't endorse wanton destruction JUST yet.  i'm sure someone will be able to help you
2006-05-27T14:17:00.000Z	Tonren	twibbler	have you tried "sudo apt-get install lib-fix-everything"?  XD
2006-05-27T14:18:00.000Z	twibbler	Tonren	nope is that the exact syntax ?.
2006-05-27T14:18:00.000Z	Tonren	twibbler	i was joking.  ;P  I WISH there was such a package
2006-05-27T14:18:00.000Z	twibbler	Tonren	I guessed but hey I can write a script like that but not sure what it would do.
2006-05-27T14:19:00.000Z	Tonren	twibbler	it would probably just ask the user what the problem is, then go to #ubuntu and ask about it
