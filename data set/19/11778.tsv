2006-08-16T11:08:00.000Z	phaedrus44		im getting my ass kicked...my system keeps "freezing up" anfd i cannot find error in /var/ log files ....any advice?
2006-08-16T11:09:00.000Z	sethk	phaedrus44	more details might help
2006-08-16T11:11:00.000Z	sethk	phaedrus44	no triggering event?
2006-08-16T11:11:00.000Z	phaedrus44	sethk	 no...i do different things and my system, freezes at different times
2006-08-16T11:12:00.000Z	sethk	phaedrus44	and nothing in the logs, no panic.  that's tough to find.
2006-08-16T11:12:00.000Z	phaedrus44	sethk	  yeah still looking through the logs...but to be honest i dont really know what to look for
2006-08-16T11:13:00.000Z	sethk	phaedrus44	anything unusual.  check messages and also syslog
2006-08-16T11:13:00.000Z	sethk	phaedrus44	I realize that "anything unusual" isn't too helpful if you don't know what is usual.
2006-08-16T11:14:00.000Z	sethk	phaedrus44	no
2006-08-16T11:18:00.000Z	sethk	phaedrus44	in irc mode, yes
2006-08-16T11:18:00.000Z	phaedrus44	sethk	i only use it for yahoo and aolim
2006-08-16T11:19:00.000Z	sethk	phaedrus44	I haven't seen problems reported with those.  Doesn't necessarily mean there aren't any, but I haven't seen them.
2006-08-16T11:23:00.000Z	sethk	phaedrus44	try running the memory test.  It's the most common reason for systems to hang.
2006-08-16T11:25:00.000Z	sethk	phaedrus44	go back to debian for a while.   if it still doesn't crash, then you'll know
2006-08-16T11:26:00.000Z	phaedrus44	sethk	 i went back to my windows xp and it didnt hang or freeze
2006-08-16T11:26:00.000Z	sethk	phaedrus44	yes, it matters
2006-08-16T11:27:00.000Z	sethk	phaedrus44	but running debian is a better test.
2006-08-16T11:36:00.000Z	sethk	phaedrus44	oh, so if a machine hangs, we should advise people to install open office.  :)
2006-08-16T11:36:00.000Z	phaedrus44	sethk	 hehe
