2005-05-29T13:51:00.000Z	Myrtti		does Ubuntu have submount in it?
2005-05-29T13:51:00.000Z	bob2	Myrtti	do you mean smbmount?
2005-06-01T11:56:00.000Z	bob2	Myrtti	that would be a metacity option, not a gnome one
2005-06-01T11:56:00.000Z	bob2	Myrtti	I'd imagine devilspie can do it
2005-06-09T15:15:00.000Z	bob2	Myrtti	rm ~/.mozilla/firefox/blah/lock
2005-06-09T15:15:00.000Z	bob2	Myrtti	(make sure you have all instance of it closed first)
2005-06-09T15:15:00.000Z	bob2	Myrtti	reinstalling it won't help
2005-06-09T15:15:00.000Z	Myrtti	bob2	did ps -axu |grep firefox, no running instances, cannot find the lockfile
2005-07-28T14:27:00.000Z	bob2	Myrtti	does dhclient work manually?
2005-07-28T14:27:00.000Z	Myrtti	bob2	yes
2005-07-28T14:27:00.000Z	bob2	Myrtti	paste /etc/network/interfaces to #flood
2005-09-06T14:19:00.000Z	bob2	Myrtti	you can;t, in general
2005-09-06T14:19:00.000Z	bob2	Myrtti	perhaps you should just explain what you did
2005-09-06T14:21:00.000Z	bob2	Myrtti	so, your question is "I upgraded to sid and now I want ubuntu hoary back"?
2005-09-12T09:20:00.000Z	Myrtti	bob2	awake still? I hope he's gone sleeping, poor thing
2005-10-18T11:29:00.000Z	Myrtti	bob2	do I get trip if I ask you why asking about backports gives me the ticket?
2005-10-29T11:40:00.000Z	bob2	Myrtti	say hi to them
2005-10-30T12:41:00.000Z	bob2	Myrtti	wiki.ubuntu.com/MOTU links to it
2005-10-30T12:41:00.000Z	Myrtti	bob2	thanks
