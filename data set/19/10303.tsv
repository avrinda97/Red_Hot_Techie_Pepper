2006-07-04T14:07:00.000Z	skybox		hi! If I use clonecd in linux/vmware will it operate just like it does in windows?
2006-07-04T14:08:00.000Z	skybox		clonecd in vmware/wine, same support as in windows?
2006-07-04T14:09:00.000Z	skybox		is there a way to burn dual layers dvd+r in linux?
2006-07-04T14:10:00.000Z	lophyte	skybox	it should be the same as burning any other dvd/d
2006-07-04T14:10:00.000Z	lophyte		dvd/cd*
2006-07-04T14:11:00.000Z	skybox	lophyte	i'm afraid not, I need to have the burner app/frontend to put my burner into bitsetting - dvdrom mode and dual layer modes
2006-07-04T14:11:00.000Z	skybox		clonecd does this on auto, but i'm wondering if I run clonecd with wine/vmware, will it be the same thing?
2006-07-04T14:11:00.000Z	lophyte	skybox	ah.. I've never done dual layer burning myself, so I'm not entirely sure.. I just assumed it was the same.
2006-07-04T14:11:00.000Z	lophyte		!duallayer
2006-07-04T14:11:00.000Z	lophyte		aww.
2006-07-04T14:11:00.000Z	lophyte		!dvd
2006-07-04T14:11:00.000Z	lophyte		!dvdburning
2006-07-04T14:11:00.000Z	lophyte		meh.
2006-07-04T14:11:00.000Z	skybox		heh, thanks anyways lophyte
2006-07-04T14:11:00.000Z	skybox		cdrecord hmm
2006-07-04T14:11:00.000Z	skybox		checking
2006-07-04T14:12:00.000Z	skybox		O
2006-07-04T14:13:00.000Z	skybox		I'll check it out, just a quickie, If I run clonecd in wine/wmare will it be the same thing?
2006-07-04T14:13:00.000Z	lophyte	skybox	I don't think VMware supports cd/dvd burning
