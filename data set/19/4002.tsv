2009-04-19T04:42:00.000Z	kkll		He's trying to boot from a LiveCD
2009-04-19T04:42:00.000Z	kkll		YeaH?
2009-04-19T04:43:00.000Z	kkll		Why would any OS run better on a Mac
2009-04-19T04:43:00.000Z	kkll		Macs aren't about choice ;)
2009-04-19T04:44:00.000Z	kkll		If you want to *install* Ubuntu on a Mac you could try bootcamp
2009-04-19T04:44:00.000Z	kkll		If its an intel mac
2009-04-19T04:44:00.000Z	kkll		Did he say it was a PPC?
2009-04-19T04:44:00.000Z	sebsebseb	kkll	uh no, bootcamp is for  turning a Mac into a Windows PC
2009-04-19T04:44:00.000Z	kkll	sebsebseb	you can use bootcamp for linux though. I think
2009-04-19T04:44:00.000Z	sebsebseb	kkll	I don't think so
2009-04-19T04:46:00.000Z	sebsebseb	kkll	,because it has certain advantages over  Mac OS X
2009-04-19T04:47:00.000Z	sebsebseb	kkll	well for a start open source and free software :)   Ubuntu is not propritary
2009-04-19T04:48:00.000Z	sebsebseb	kkll	normalley yes, but you can dual boot
2009-04-19T04:48:00.000Z	sebsebseb	kkll	or use parralles or something to virtual machine Linux
2009-04-19T04:49:00.000Z	sebsebseb	kkll	some people will buy Macs for the hardware more so than the OS though,   Mac hardware is meant to be quite a bit better than PC hardware after all.  altough as some would say  Mac's are just overpriced PC's with slightly differnet hardware
2009-04-19T04:50:00.000Z	sebsebseb	kkll	I have heard quite a few Mac OS X users, going Ubuntu, and then saying Ubuntu is better
2009-04-19T04:51:00.000Z	sebsebseb	kkll	each OS has it's advantages and disadvantages,  off topic now though
2009-04-19T04:54:00.000Z	sebsebseb	kkll	OS  X may be better than  Windows here and there, but like Windows it's propritary, it restricts peoples freedoms and locks people in.   so  open source and free software for the win :)   read up about free software properly on http://www.gnu.org in the philosphey section.  Ubuntu users you should know about the freedoms behind the software your using, so you should check out those articles as well
