2005-11-04T17:29:00.000Z	odie5533	WebLOCH	I did indeed. Works perfectly
2005-11-04T17:30:00.000Z	WebLOCH	odie5533	apt is telling me I cant install it b ecause I have a load of unmet depedancies
2005-11-04T17:30:00.000Z	WebLOCH	odie5533	when I try to get them it complains

2005-11-04T17:32:00.000Z	WebLOCH	odie5533	Sorry for the trouble, apparently it was due to a couple of broken packages
2005-11-04T17:32:00.000Z	odie5533	WebLOCH	Is it working now though?
2005-11-04T17:33:00.000Z	WebLOCH	odie5533	sure is...
2005-11-04T17:33:00.000Z	WebLOCH	odie5533	do you always have to change permissions for the plugin directory before it actually works ?
2005-11-04T17:34:00.000Z	odie5533	WebLOCH	what plugin directory?
2005-11-04T17:35:00.000Z	WebLOCH	odie5533	azureus has a plugin dir, it downloads its own updates to there, and keeps complaining unless I change permissions to allow for writing etc
2005-11-04T17:35:00.000Z	odie5533	WebLOCH	I personally didn't have to, but if it works and still complains you should be fine. Else, change the permissions if it doesn't work
2005-11-04T17:35:00.000Z	WebLOCH	odie5533	haha it just segged :(
