2007-12-08T20:40:00.000Z	gvsa123	wols_	i got firestarter to work by commenting out  #Defaults !lecture,tty_tickets,!fqdn and adding  Defaults !lecture,tty_tickets,!fqdn,env_reset,env_keep+="DISPLAY HOME XAUTHORIZATION"
2007-12-17T18:11:00.000Z	wols_	gvsa123	if you run ntp or ntpdate, it does
2007-12-17T18:11:00.000Z	gvsa123	wols_	i run that on the terminal?
2007-12-17T18:11:00.000Z	wols_	gvsa123	ntp is daemon, ntpdate a program for the terminal
2007-12-17T18:12:00.000Z	wols_	gvsa123	ntpdate pool.ntp.org
2007-12-17T18:13:00.000Z	gvsa123	wols_	17 Dec 21:09:38 ntpdate[6674]: the NTP socket is in use, exiting
2007-12-17T18:14:00.000Z	wols_	gvsa123	when you ran the ntpdate command I gave you?
2007-12-17T18:14:00.000Z	gvsa123	wols_	yeah... plus sudo
2007-12-17T18:16:00.000Z	wols_	gvsa123	running "ntpdate pool.ntp.org"? if so, use netstat if anything listens on the ntp port
2007-12-17T18:18:00.000Z	gvsa123	wols_	by the output of ntpdate i assume the ports it was referring to were 6673 and 6674, but none of those appeared in netstat
2007-12-17T18:19:00.000Z	gvsa123	wols_	oh wait... that was the i-node i was lookng at
2007-12-17T18:19:00.000Z	wols_	gvsa123	what makes you think those ports are related to NTP?
2007-12-17T18:20:00.000Z	gvsa123	wols_	i dunno actually... lol.. because of this: 17 Dec 21:09:38 ntpdate[6674]: the NTP socket is in use, exiting?
2007-12-17T18:20:00.000Z	gvsa123	wols_	:)
2007-12-17T18:20:00.000Z	wols_	gvsa123	that's no inode either
2007-12-17T18:23:00.000Z	wols_	gvsa123	so what IS the output of the command I told you?
2007-12-17T18:24:00.000Z	gvsa123	wols_	Hagg1: oh there you go... in network tools, netstat, active network services, there are connections to port/service 123
2007-12-17T18:25:00.000Z	gvsa123	wols_	the command was ntpdate pool.ntp.org?
