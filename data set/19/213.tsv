2012-07-04T11:06:00.000Z	dryhay		hi. how to install webcamstudio or is there any other equivalent available?
2012-07-04T11:07:00.000Z	fidel	dryhay	is that supposed to be a package?
2012-07-04T11:09:00.000Z	dryhay	fidel	 when i try to install this: http://www.ws4gl.org/download/installing-on-ubuntu message appears "The module webcamstudio is not loaded.  Virtual webcam will not be available."
2012-07-04T11:10:00.000Z	fidel	dryhay	those are debian packages ... do you know by chance if those are supposed to work at all in ubuntu?
2012-07-04T11:11:00.000Z	dryhay	fidel	 I have no idea. All I know is that lots of people have problems with that and I couldn't find any solution http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1393658
2012-07-04T11:12:00.000Z	dryhay	fidel	 Maybe there is somewhere a proper equivalent for webcamstudio?
2012-07-04T11:13:00.000Z	fidel	dryhay	as i havent read the project page and you havent mentioned the function - i dont know ;)
2012-07-04T11:14:00.000Z	dryhay	fidel	 I want to use chatroulette. I can't get in. My webcam is not working as well.
2012-07-04T11:14:00.000Z	fidel	dryhay	first try to get cheese to work - some kind of default app to access and use webcams
2012-07-04T11:15:00.000Z	dryhay	fidel	 cheese is not recognizing my Creative webcam.
2012-07-04T11:16:00.000Z	fidel	dryhay	then check out your webcams model and search for that one in combination with your ubuntu-version
2012-07-04T11:16:00.000Z	fidel	dryhay	such devices usualy have a clear model-string/name
2012-07-04T11:18:00.000Z	dryhay	fidel	 Bus 002 Device 004: ID 041e:4045 Creative Technology, Ltd Live! Cam Voice
2012-07-04T11:19:00.000Z	fidel	dryhay	now use that and feed the search engine of your choice combined with your distri-version
2012-07-04T11:19:00.000Z	fidel	dryhay	with some luck you arent the first one trying to get that specific hw to work
2012-07-04T11:20:00.000Z	fidel	dryhay	good luck - cant help you further here
2012-07-04T11:20:00.000Z	dryhay	fidel	 chees found my laptop webcam, but chatroulette is still not working.
2012-07-04T11:21:00.000Z	fidel	dryhay	i have no ide about those topics - as i dont use em. please focus on the channel and/or websearches - not on single persons in the chat.
2012-07-04T11:21:00.000Z	dryhay	fidel	 ok, thx
