2009-07-12T04:52:00.000Z	mzz	seeks	err? just mount the partition?
2009-07-12T04:52:00.000Z	seeks	mzz	 Well, I'm really quite the samba newbie.  I actually haven't gotten that far yet
2009-07-12T04:53:00.000Z	seeks	mzz	 It gives me problems trying to mount it, but no problems if I just use "smbclient," for whatever reason.
2009-07-12T04:53:00.000Z	mzz	seeks	try "mount -t cifs '\\1.2.3.4\sharename' /mnt" iirc
2009-07-12T04:57:00.000Z	seeks	mzz	 Welp, nothing yet, but I'm getting closer to it anyway.  Thanks for the tip.
2009-07-12T04:57:00.000Z	mzz	seeks	failed how?
2009-07-12T04:58:00.000Z	seeks	mzz	 It just freezes and I have to control+c in the terminal, mostly.  I've tried a few different ips (198.162xxx, 127.0xxx, etc).
2009-07-12T04:59:00.000Z	mzz	seeks	err? It shouldn't freeze if the ip you're targetting is reachable
2009-07-12T05:01:00.000Z	seeks	mzz	 Yeah, I figure there's some weird thing I'm going to have to deal with.  This is going to take me a while, but oh well.
2009-07-12T05:01:00.000Z	mzz	seeks	if it really gets stuck that sounds like the other system has something enabled firewall-wise that's interfering
2009-07-12T05:01:00.000Z	mzz	seeks	(but if I'm right you should get that in everything that speaks smb or cifs, not just mount)
2009-07-12T05:02:00.000Z	seeks	mzz	 Could be.  I can still connect with smbclient and all that.
2009-07-12T05:02:00.000Z	mzz	seeks	what os does the target run?
2009-07-12T05:02:00.000Z	seeks	mzz	 Windows 7
2009-07-12T05:02:00.000Z	seeks	mzz	 RC.
2009-07-12T05:02:00.000Z	mzz	seeks	huh, then I'd expect cifs to work. Sorry, not sure what's going on there.
2009-07-12T05:03:00.000Z	seeks	mzz	 No problem man, thanks for the help.  One last question... are wildcards even possible with the "get" command?
2009-07-12T05:03:00.000Z	mzz	seeks	beats me, I haven't touched the cli utils in ages.
2009-07-12T05:03:00.000Z	seeks	mzz	 Haha, alright.  Thanks again.
