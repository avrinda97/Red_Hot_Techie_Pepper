2005-03-24T12:53:00.000Z	andrewski	Waterloo	what's the problem?
2005-03-24T12:54:00.000Z	andrewski	Waterloo	i'd just install xfce over top of it; you don't need to remove gnome, and it'd be nice to have a fallback in case you don't like it (though i doubt that :)
2005-03-24T12:55:00.000Z	andrewski	Waterloo	then, restart gdm and you can change "sessions"
2005-03-24T12:56:00.000Z	andrewski	Waterloo	from where did you get the packages?
2005-03-24T12:56:00.000Z	andrewski	Waterloo	you should get the ones from os-works.com; they have the newer version.
2005-03-24T12:57:00.000Z	andrewski	Waterloo	go there.
2005-03-24T12:57:00.000Z	andrewski	Waterloo	and while you're there, set up the deb repository.
2005-03-24T12:58:00.000Z	andrewski	Waterloo	there are instructions.
2005-03-24T13:00:00.000Z	andrewski	Waterloo	you should take this conversation to #xfce where someone could help you; this isn't an ubuntu problem.
