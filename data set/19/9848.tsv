2009-06-05T09:45:00.000Z	Ali_		yes i have tlyu - but there are loads of log files - i dont know what to look for either
2009-06-05T09:46:00.000Z	Ali_		any one else?
2009-06-05T09:48:00.000Z	Ali_		ok anyone know how to delete all emails in the mailq that are being sent by a partcular email address?
2009-06-05T09:48:00.000Z	QRZ	Ali_	You've got a Web app or something that apache is serving that looks to be the culprit.  Start with all the server-side scripts that apache has access to.  It's probably a PHP script or something similar.
2009-06-05T09:50:00.000Z	Ali_	QRZ	there r lots of users on the system (ands lots of files) and so i dont know where to start looking or how!
2009-06-05T09:52:00.000Z	QRZ	Ali_	So the messages are in still Postfix's queue?
2009-06-05T09:52:00.000Z	Ali_	QRZ	yes
2009-06-05T09:52:00.000Z	QRZ	Ali_	Have you viewed the contents of any of them?
2009-06-05T09:53:00.000Z	QRZ	Ali_	Perhaps there are clues as to what process or user is sending them based on the content.
2009-06-05T09:54:00.000Z	QRZ	Ali_	I presume you are the admin for the box in question?
2009-06-05T09:58:00.000Z	QRZ	Ali_	Postfix can be set to dis-allow relaying of messages from certain local users, I think.  But to answer your question, use the postsuper command.
2009-06-05T09:58:00.000Z	QRZ	Ali_	'man postsuper' at the command line should be helpful.  Good luck.
2009-06-05T10:01:00.000Z	QRZ	Ali_	Lots of users on that box?
2009-06-05T10:03:00.000Z	QRZ	Ali_	Perhaps a manual audit of the users' web directories would turn up something.
2009-06-05T10:05:00.000Z	Ali_	QRZ	yeah too many users
2009-06-05T10:06:00.000Z	QRZ	Ali_	Looks like it's time for policy-enforcement!
2009-06-05T10:06:00.000Z	Ali_	QRZ	absolutely - i reckon that a script has a bug in it
