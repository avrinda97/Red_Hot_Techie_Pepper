2010-11-20T12:06:00.000Z	alesan		hi
2010-11-20T12:06:00.000Z	alesan		so I am installing updating my mom's PC to ubuntu 9.10 remotely
2010-11-20T12:07:00.000Z	alesan		now my question is: why ubuntu changes GUI and colors every time? isn't this crazy? my mom is completely lost now
2010-11-20T12:07:00.000Z	alesan		gdm is completely new (and much worse than before)
2010-11-20T12:08:00.000Z	alesan		is 10.04 much different from 9.10?
2010-11-20T12:09:00.000Z	alesan		I usu kubuntu myself and I have my own problems with kde4
2010-11-20T12:09:00.000Z	alesan		I will stay with the LTS version
2010-11-20T12:10:00.000Z	alesan		so I was asking if 10.04 is not much different than 9.10 or if I will find surprises
2010-11-20T12:10:00.000Z	alesan		and my mom freaks out
2010-11-20T12:10:00.000Z	alesan		and I live on another continent
2010-11-20T12:12:00.000Z	iflema	alesan	put ya old girl on a LTS release... 10.04 is a LTS.... 3 years stay same give/take....
2010-11-20T12:12:00.000Z	alesan	iflema	exactly, that is what I will do
2010-11-20T12:15:00.000Z	iflema	alesan	10.04 will do both those tasks... and a nice new ui change... and buttons can go back on the right if you wish ;)
2010-11-20T12:15:00.000Z	alesan	iflema	nooo 10.04 is the one that is like a MAC?
2010-11-20T12:16:00.000Z	iflema	alesan	you can click a couple o time and have it look like karmic 9.10 no dramas
2010-11-20T12:16:00.000Z	alesan	iflema	my mom liked the most the look of... mh what was before the one before the animal with horns?
2010-11-20T12:21:00.000Z	alesan	iflema	do you have a reference on how to do that?
2010-11-20T12:24:00.000Z	iflema	alesan	avoid the 3d drivers for ATI and Nvidia... if those graphic cards apply to the setup... just go with the 2d open options = the splash screen will work ;)
2010-11-20T12:25:00.000Z	alesan	iflema	I think she has an integrated intel or something
