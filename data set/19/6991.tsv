2008-03-21T09:00:00.000Z	Jangari		i have a command that I want to make an executable program, essentially, it's in my local /bin directory on a server, ow do I make it so I can run it?
2008-03-21T09:00:00.000Z	Jangari		how*
2008-03-21T09:01:00.000Z	Jangari		no, a text file that just contains a command
2008-03-21T09:01:00.000Z	jester45	Jangari	chmod 755 file should do it
2008-03-21T09:01:00.000Z	Jangari		i want to run t as a cron job
2008-03-21T09:02:00.000Z	Jangari		okay, i made it 764 though, will that do?
2008-03-21T09:02:00.000Z	Jangari		I don't want other users to execute it
2008-03-21T09:03:00.000Z	Jangari		no, it should be 754, because i want those in my group to execute, but not to write, and I don't want others to do anything but read
2008-03-21T09:04:00.000Z	Jangari		i'm the owner of the file, unop__, it's in ~/bin on a remote server, will it still run?
2008-03-21T09:04:00.000Z	jester45	Jangari	what about others
2008-03-21T09:05:00.000Z	Jangari	jester45	others shouldn't be able to write or execute
2008-03-21T09:05:00.000Z	jester45	Jangari	750 would like owner rw and execute group exec/read but not write and nothing for pub
2008-03-21T09:06:00.000Z	Jangari		i don't mind read acess for public, 754
2008-03-21T09:06:00.000Z	Jangari		but still, how do i make it run as a command in a terminal
2008-03-21T09:06:00.000Z	jester45		type it
2008-03-21T09:07:00.000Z	jester45	Jangari	you should be able to type it out
2008-03-21T09:07:00.000Z	Jangari		it doesn't run
2008-03-21T09:07:00.000Z	Jangari		i don't have su access on this server, by the way, i want to run it as a user
2008-03-21T09:07:00.000Z	jester45	Jangari	u try the full path
