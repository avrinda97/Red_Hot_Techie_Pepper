2011-01-10T11:42:00.000Z	bonjoyee	vinok	saved the modules to be loaded on startup? and rebooted since?
2011-01-10T11:40:00.000Z	bonjoyee	vinok	did you run "sudo sensors-detect"?
2011-01-10T11:41:00.000Z	vinok	bonjoyee	yes i did and answer yes to all of the questions and save it after it finished scanning
2011-01-10T11:43:00.000Z	vinok	bonjoyee	yup, i rebooted. then installed sensors-applet from synaptics, added it to my panel. it can detect the CPU and GPU temp but not the fan anymore. it's really strange.
2011-01-10T11:44:00.000Z	bonjoyee	vinok	whats the output of sensors?
2011-01-10T11:47:00.000Z	vinok	bonjoyee	what do you mean by the output? are you referring to sensors-applet (GUI) in my panel? if yes, in the preferences part it shows 4 categories. libsensors, acpi, hddtemp, nvidia. thats all in 10.4 it also shows fan category
2011-01-10T11:48:00.000Z	bonjoyee	vinok	run "sensors" in a terminal...and paste the output on pastebin
2011-01-10T11:50:00.000Z	vinok	bonjoyee	http://pastebin.com/qm0bnKu8 here it is
2011-01-10T11:55:00.000Z	bonjoyee	vinok	run "sudo sensors-detect" once again the paste all the output on pastebin
2011-01-10T11:57:00.000Z	vinok	bonjoyee	ok 1 sec
2011-01-10T12:01:00.000Z	vinok	bonjoyee	here it is http://pastebin.com/0aYnshCK i'll just reboot again to see if anything changes brb. thanks bonjoyee
2011-01-10T12:16:00.000Z	vinok	bonjoyee	back still the same..
2011-01-10T12:16:00.000Z	bonjoyee	vinok	its not loading a driver for your super IO chip..thats the cause
2011-01-10T12:17:00.000Z	vinok	bonjoyee	thanks, so what should i do to make it load? is there a way?
2011-01-10T12:20:00.000Z	bonjoyee	vinok	did it work in 10.04?
2011-01-10T12:23:00.000Z	vinok	bonjoyee	yeah it did. but only for monitoring. anyways if it can't be done its ok. when i check the fan physically it is working but guess no monitoring for me in 10.10. anyways thanks bonjoyee for enlightening me.
2011-01-10T12:23:00.000Z	vinok	bonjoyee	thanks
2011-01-10T12:25:00.000Z	bonjoyee	vinok	as the last bet..you could add the module that worked in 10.04..to /etc/modules in 10.10..not sure it will work though!
2011-01-10T12:26:00.000Z	vinok	bonjoyee	yeah i think thats a good idea. i'll try that one a bit later and let u know.
