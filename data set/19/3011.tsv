2009-11-26T21:44:00.000Z	mrXX	zortec	i want to just know what info i get when i export a table structure
2009-11-26T21:45:00.000Z	mrXX	zortec	can i show you the copy paste
2009-11-26T21:46:00.000Z	mrXX	zortec	http://paste.ubuntu.com/328610/
2009-11-26T21:47:00.000Z	mrXX	zortec	what is the difference of the 'email' between line 5 and 13
2009-11-26T21:50:00.000Z	zortec	mrXX	there is no difference in the "email" fields in line 5 and 13
2009-11-26T21:50:00.000Z	zortec	mrXX	in line 5 you create a field called "email" and in line 13 you have set up an index for status_2 to use "email"
2009-11-26T21:51:00.000Z	zortec	mrXX	I do wonder about the structure of your database... and why there are so many keys in that table
2009-11-26T21:51:00.000Z	mrXX	zortec	i donno i just exported the table structure
2009-11-26T21:52:00.000Z	mrXX	zortec	for some reason in the view that i create, only ip works but not email
2009-11-26T21:52:00.000Z	zortec	mrXX	I'm not sure what you're asking or trying to get help, could you tell me the question again?
2009-11-26T21:54:00.000Z	mrXX	zortec	well i have a pommo mass email software and it sees in the database to get the email add and all info(this is the structure of that table which pommo looks into)
2009-11-26T21:54:00.000Z	mrXX	zortec	does it make sense to you up to now?
2009-11-26T21:54:00.000Z	zortec	mrXX	sort of, I'm not familiar with pommo mass software
2009-11-26T21:55:00.000Z	mrXX	zortec	so what i m creating is a view of that table so that i dont have to import all email from another database
2009-11-26T21:55:00.000Z	zortec	mrXX	you should use a gui interface like phpmyadmin if you are not and make sure that you export only what you need in the export tab
2009-11-26T21:56:00.000Z	mrXX	zortec	i m so confused and i dont know how to put the question, i wll talk to u later - thanks for offering your help
