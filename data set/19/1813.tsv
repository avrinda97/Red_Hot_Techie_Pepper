2010-10-09T20:33:00.000Z	researcher123		how do I know if I should install 32 bit or 64 bit system on my machine
2010-10-09T20:35:00.000Z	Ken8521	researcher123	free -m
2010-10-09T20:36:00.000Z	Ken8521	researcher123	you can... personally i think there's more disadvantages to 64bit than advantages.. but that will depend on your hardware
2010-10-09T20:37:00.000Z	Ken8521	researcher123	if you don't know, use 32bit...
2010-10-09T20:38:00.000Z	Ken8521	researcher123	use 32bit, as said
2010-10-09T22:13:00.000Z	Ken8521	researcher123	ipconfig in a terminal
2010-10-09T22:14:00.000Z	researcher123	Ken8521	is it ifconfig
2010-10-09T22:14:00.000Z	researcher123	Ken8521	it failed
2010-10-09T22:14:00.000Z	Ken8521	researcher123	sorry, ifconfig
2010-10-09T22:14:00.000Z	researcher123	Ken8521	I ran n it gives so much result
2010-10-09T22:15:00.000Z	Ken8521	researcher123	so go throught he list, and find yoru IP..... are you connected to a router?
2010-10-09T22:15:00.000Z	Ken8521	researcher123	are you wireless, or wired?
2010-10-09T22:15:00.000Z	researcher123	Ken8521	got this inet addr:192.168.1.6
2010-10-09T22:15:00.000Z	Ken8521	researcher123	thats your Ip from the router... is that what you wanted? or do you want your IP from your provider
2010-10-09T22:16:00.000Z	researcher123	Ken8521	I want it from provider
2010-10-09T22:16:00.000Z	Ken8521	researcher123	easiest way to get that, is go to whatismyip.org
2010-10-09T22:17:00.000Z	researcher123	Ken8521	Actually I want to check safety of my Ip through a program
2010-10-09T22:18:00.000Z	researcher123	Ken8521	thanks
2010-10-09T22:18:00.000Z	Ken8521	researcher123	well if you need your IP for that, whatismyip.org will show it to you
