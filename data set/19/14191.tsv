2005-07-05T16:19:00.000Z	littlefae		Yes, but it only filters incoming traffic, from the net, not into the WLAN
2005-07-05T16:19:00.000Z	littlefae		It worked when I had the netgear PCMCIA card on loan, but not with this card.
2005-07-05T16:20:00.000Z	littlefae		Yeah, I'll take it back to the shop, and pay twice as much for the netgear, then. :/
2005-07-05T16:20:00.000Z	littlefae		I'm so annoyed with Linux for it's lack of hardware support. >_<
2005-07-05T16:21:00.000Z	littlefae		But... when something /does/ work with linux, you usually need to recompile this, add that, compile this, make a .deb and reinstall it.
2005-07-05T16:22:00.000Z	littlefae		Linux has been out for how long now?... ANd they haven't yet made installing drivers easy? :(
2005-07-05T16:23:00.000Z	littlefae		I agree, 98% of my laptop was supported out of the box.  But networking on it its proving to be an absolute irritant.  Every single item I've borroed and purchased, with the exception of that one netgear card, has failed, despite all these howtos, which I followed to the last letter.
2005-07-05T16:24:00.000Z	littlefae		And that one netgear isn't made any more. :(
2005-07-05T16:24:00.000Z	littlefae		But why make it hard for the user, when it /is/ available?
2005-07-05T16:24:00.000Z	Seveas	littlefae	that is not the fault of linux
2005-07-05T16:27:00.000Z	Seveas	littlefae	that is because solutions only work in the environment of the author of that solution
2005-07-05T16:28:00.000Z	Seveas	littlefae	not really...
2005-07-05T16:29:00.000Z	Seveas	littlefae	again, not really
2005-07-05T16:29:00.000Z	Seveas	littlefae	it's distributions like RedCrap that instroduce stupid incompatibilities
2005-07-05T16:31:00.000Z	Seveas	littlefae	in an ideal open source world you would not need to install drivers
2005-07-08T15:18:00.000Z	Seveas	littlefae	sure :)
2005-07-08T15:18:00.000Z	Seveas	littlefae	install the one you like and choose it from the login screen
2005-07-08T15:19:00.000Z	Seveas	littlefae	then you need to install it ;)
