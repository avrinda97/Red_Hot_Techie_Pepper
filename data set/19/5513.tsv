2008-06-14T11:27:00.000Z	Felix_Krull		Hello, please, how to make active mp3 decoding in Hardy? I tried with steps for earlier versions of Ubuntu, but no luck...
2008-06-14T11:28:00.000Z	nickrud	Felix_Krull	you mean for rhythmbox and the like?
2008-06-14T11:29:00.000Z	nickrud	Felix_Krull	ah, use make mp3's when you rip
2008-06-14T11:30:00.000Z	nickrud	Felix_Krull	for sound-juicer, look at the help, preferences, all the way at the bottom
2008-06-14T11:31:00.000Z	nickrud	Felix_Krull	I take that back, preferences doesn't have it in hardy .. a sec
2008-06-14T11:32:00.000Z	Felix_Krull	nickrud	so what should I do?
2008-06-14T11:33:00.000Z	nickrud	Felix_Krull	looking for the setup
2008-06-14T11:33:00.000Z	nickrud	Felix_Krull	you have gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly   and gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly-multiverse installed?
2008-06-14T11:34:00.000Z	Felix_Krull	nickrud	I think not multiverse... Let me check...
2008-06-14T11:36:00.000Z	Felix_Krull	nickrud	ugly or bad? It seems that for some it is bad, for other it is ugly.
2008-06-14T11:37:00.000Z	nickrud	Felix_Krull	pretty sure it's the ugly.
2008-06-14T11:37:00.000Z	nickrud	Felix_Krull	for mp3, that is
2008-06-14T11:38:00.000Z	Felix_Krull	nickrud	But I can leave bad, since it is there? Sorry for asking stupid questions, but I read somewhere about collision between the two, and that some earlier Ubuntu used bad, and the other ugly.
2008-06-14T11:39:00.000Z	nickrud	Felix_Krull	the bad are the ones that aren't very polished, as in written well. ugly are fine, but have licensing/patent issues, like mp3
2008-06-14T11:40:00.000Z	Felix_Krull	nickrud	So, to uninstall bad?
2008-06-14T11:40:00.000Z	nickrud	Felix_Krull	your choice. I have them
2008-06-14T11:41:00.000Z	Felix_Krull	nickrud	Both? It doesn't matter?
2008-06-14T11:42:00.000Z	nickrud	Felix_Krull	it doesn't matter. If you have any qualms, I'd remove both bad versions
2008-06-14T11:44:00.000Z	Felix_Krull	nickrud	Thank you so much!
