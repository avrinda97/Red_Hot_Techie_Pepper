2005-09-14T14:17:00.000Z	typo_		i have silent data corruption on my ubuntu install :(
2005-09-14T14:17:00.000Z	typo_		are there any solutions for this yet ?
2005-09-14T14:19:00.000Z	windex	typo_	silent data corruption is usually a result of a failing disk, otherwise it's experienced by hundreds.
2005-09-14T14:19:00.000Z	typo_	windex	no. this is a case of SATA/PATA driver bugs..
2005-09-14T14:19:00.000Z	windex	typo_	ah. no idea then.
2005-09-14T14:19:00.000Z	windex	typo_	if it says 'experimental' it is. :)
2005-09-14T14:20:00.000Z	typo_	windex	thats not helpful. the hardware i use is claimed to be supported
2005-09-14T14:20:00.000Z	windex	typo_	how can you be sure it's a driver bug?
2005-09-14T14:21:00.000Z	typo_	windex	i only get _cdrom_ silent data corruption, when i enable SATA
2005-09-14T14:21:00.000Z	typo_	windex	what else ?
2005-09-14T14:23:00.000Z	windex	typo_	it might be a software issue, but it might not be with the driver. could be firmware/driver combination, etc. does the drive need special drivers under windows?
2005-09-14T14:23:00.000Z	typo_	windex	i don't own a copy of windows
2005-09-14T14:23:00.000Z	windex	typo_	and, btw, i am not attacking you, it's just that fixing a software problem is a lot harder, so ruling out hardware entirely is usually the first step.
2005-09-14T14:24:00.000Z	typo_	windex	sure. but it is annoying. you're telling me i have a hardware problem when there are pages and pages about SATA/PATA problems that behave like this
2005-09-14T14:24:00.000Z	windex	typo_	im saying you have to eliminate the possibility of a hardware problem before you can blame a software problem, since the hardware problem can be troubleshooted by you, and the software one probably can't.
2005-09-14T14:25:00.000Z	typo_	windex	i've done that.
2005-09-14T14:25:00.000Z	windex	typo_	ok, then ignore me. i wont try.
2005-09-14T15:17:00.000Z	typo_	windex	i've now successfully installed using knoppix, and will convert to ubuntu from there..
