2007-12-21T11:12:00.000Z	Mini-Me		sorry to butt in, but I have a quick noob question:  What files are Gnome/X/etc. mouse settings (sensitivity and acceleration) stored in?  I need to know so I can back up these settings, etc...I can't find any relevant settings in /etc/X11/xorg.conf, either :(
2007-12-21T11:14:00.000Z	nickrud	Mini-Me	the mouse conf is kept in ~/.gconf/desktop/gnome/peripherals/mouse
2007-12-21T11:14:00.000Z	Mini-Me	nickrud	 thanks to you, too :)
2007-12-21T11:15:00.000Z	nickrud	Mini-Me	you should just back up all the dot files, that covers just about everything :)
2007-12-21T11:16:00.000Z	Mini-Me	nickrud	 well technically, I'm actually porting some settings over to a second box, so I'm not wanting to backup everything :)  this is something I'll be doing on a regular basis as I move from house to house every few days (run a script to backup to a MyBook, then back to each computer).  If I backed up ALL of home, I could run into some nasty version mismatch problems, especially if I try another distro :o
2007-12-21T11:17:00.000Z	nickrud	Mini-Me	ah. Well, nearly all the gnome settings are kept in that dir. if you run gconf-editor, you can browse through the settings, and the tree on the left matches the directory structure. That way you can find what you want to carry over
2007-12-21T11:19:00.000Z	Mini-Me	nickrud	 thanks!  I'll check that out.  Since mouse settings are specific to Gnome, that raises some interesting questions:  If I installed KDE and Gnome, would the settings used depend on the active window (KDE or Gnome app) or the active desktop environment (i.e. if I run Amarok in Gnome, it would use Gnome's mouse settings)?
2007-12-21T11:19:00.000Z	nickrud	Mini-Me	desktop settings
2007-12-21T11:31:00.000Z	Mini-Me	nickrud	- good point - I forgot about how different mouse hardware behaves differently
2007-12-21T11:23:00.000Z	Mini-Me	nickrud	flannel, ifireball:  thanks...I still haven't actually found my perfect sensitivity yet, but I'm working on it, and I was wanting to make sure I could transfer the settings back and forth between boxes.  It's only a moderate concern with regular desktop stuff, but in Windows, I know that Windows mouse settings greatly affected sensitivity in games.  Is this generally the case in Linux?  Do Linux games tend to take into account d
2007-12-21T11:25:00.000Z	nickrud	Mini-Me	don't play many games in linux, so I don't have any opinion on that. I seem to have to change the settings to different values on different machines, though
2007-12-21T11:30:00.000Z	nickrud	Mini-Me	no, nothing ifireball disagrees with what I said, I'm talking about different screen sizes, different base sensitivity of mice, that kind of thing. Not how the software messes around on top of that
2007-12-21T11:32:00.000Z	Mini-Me	nickrud	 I just noticed the directory you led me to has an xml file with mouse settings, but it only mentions accleration (and a few other settings), not sensitivity.  How did you locate this in the first place?  I might have to do a bit more poking around in the same general area...
2007-12-21T11:33:00.000Z	nickrud	Mini-Me	use that gconf-editor I mentioned. Only the things you actually changed will show up there
2007-12-21T11:34:00.000Z	Mini-Me	nickrud	 oh, right...and actually, the sensitivity might be in there after all, if it's "motion_threshold" - I'll install that package right now though.
2007-12-21T11:35:00.000Z	nickrud	Mini-Me	it's already installed, just run it from the terminal. Or, right click the menu bar and turn on the menu item
2007-12-21T11:35:00.000Z	Mini-Me	nickrud	 just noticed that :)
2007-12-21T11:35:00.000Z	nickrud	Mini-Me	under apps->system
2007-12-21T11:42:00.000Z	Mini-Me	nickrud	ifireball, flannel:  thanks guys - that's all I needed, and it's time for bed now! :)
