2009-07-02T13:37:00.000Z	indus	Slemming	error when loading shared libraries libxul
2009-07-02T13:37:00.000Z	indus	Slemming	even though its there in the ff folder
2009-07-02T13:38:00.000Z	Slemming	indus	sudo apt-get install xulrunner-1.9.1
2009-07-02T13:38:00.000Z	Slemming	indus	I think, that's one of the dependancies my firefox 3.5v4 has
2009-07-02T13:38:00.000Z	indus	Slemming	oops iam on hardy
2009-07-02T13:39:00.000Z	indus	Slemming	but the thing is, mozilla binaries come with their own version of xul i believe and it loads it from same directory
2009-07-02T13:46:00.000Z	indus	Slemming	ok it runs but loads old firefox .
2009-07-02T13:47:00.000Z	Slemming	indus	doh
