2006-04-21T07:07:00.000Z	blindx		Who told me to do "man mencoder" ?
2006-04-21T07:08:00.000Z	blindx		six thousand, five hundred lines. holy christ.
2006-04-21T07:09:00.000Z	blindx		hey, I have another question while I've got some knowledgable people in here :D
2006-04-21T07:09:00.000Z	blindx		I have some movies that I used to run under windows... that worked no problem. sound/movie worked.
2006-04-21T07:10:00.000Z	blindx		The same movies, under ubuntu, don't output sound.
2006-04-21T07:10:00.000Z	blindx		What could be the issue there?
2006-04-21T07:10:00.000Z	naxxtor	blindx	you might not have the correct decompression codecs installed?
2006-04-21T07:10:00.000Z	naxxtor	blindx	specifically the audio codec
2006-04-21T07:11:00.000Z	naxxtor	blindx	presumabley you can give it decoder plugins for audio too
2006-04-21T07:13:00.000Z	naxxtor	blindx	under VLC->Settings->Preferences->audio codecs there is a list of supported codecs
2006-04-21T07:13:00.000Z	naxxtor	blindx	if your videos don't have a audio track in encoded with one of those vlc won't play em
2006-04-21T07:14:00.000Z	blindx	naxxtor	but if they didn't have an audio track, they shouldn't have played under windows, right?
2006-04-21T07:14:00.000Z	naxxtor	blindx	i mean an audio track encoded in something VLC doesn't support - like AC3
2006-04-21T07:15:00.000Z	naxxtor	blindx	i think that it'll be AC3 that you're missing - since that's used for films quite a bit
2006-04-21T07:20:00.000Z	naxxtor	blindx	volume turned down?
2006-04-21T07:20:00.000Z	blindx	naxxtor	if my volume was turned down, I would have left, and you'd never see me under this name again :P
2006-04-21T07:20:00.000Z	naxxtor	blindx	:p heh heh
2006-04-22T16:15:00.000Z	naxxtor	blindx	try the Gimp
2006-04-22T16:16:00.000Z	naxxtor	blindx	it's no real subsitute, i know, but it does work kinda
