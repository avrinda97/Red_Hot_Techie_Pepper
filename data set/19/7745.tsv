2007-07-02T08:22:00.000Z	shiester_mieste		hmm i just noticed that they can ping each other
2007-07-02T08:23:00.000Z	shiester_mieste		but they dont see each other in the network !
2007-07-02T08:24:00.000Z	shiester_mieste		blarg
2007-07-02T08:25:00.000Z	shiester_mieste		yeah i know
2007-07-02T08:25:00.000Z	shiester_mieste		what i mean is, they dont show up in the network places area
2007-07-02T08:27:00.000Z	shiester_mieste		wait a second...the other computer doesnt have windows sharing (SMB) installed...would that stop it from working
2007-07-02T08:27:00.000Z	shiester_mieste		i try to share a folder and the only option is "do not share"...what the crap
2007-07-02T08:27:00.000Z	shiester_mieste		isnt there a "linux" way of sharing :/
2007-07-02T08:28:00.000Z	andrewkk	shiester_mieste	it's called NFS. people don't use it as much on ubuntu though so you're not going to get quite as much support with it. my recommendation is to stick with samba.
2007-07-02T08:29:00.000Z	andrewkk	shiester_mieste	samba is just one implementation of SMB. check out wikipedia.
2007-07-02T08:32:00.000Z	andrewkk	shiester_mieste	SMB isn't -only- for windows. it's just known for that because it happens to be what windows uses.
2007-07-02T08:34:00.000Z	andrewkk	shiester_mieste	i
2007-07-02T08:35:00.000Z	andrewkk	shiester_mieste	...'m not sure about it, but you should look into if it's on the ubuntu cd.
2007-07-02T08:48:00.000Z	andrewkk	shiester_mieste	do a "sudo -s -H" for a root shell, run the command, then exit
2007-07-02T08:48:00.000Z	shiester_mieste	andrewkk	do you mean run "sudo -s -H" as a command by itself?
2007-07-02T08:49:00.000Z	andrewkk	shiester_mieste	yes. that will give you a temporary root prompt.
2007-07-02T08:51:00.000Z	andrewkk	shiester_mieste	i don't think so, but i'm not positive.
