2005-04-18T16:19:00.000Z	debiuntu		after update throuth ubuntu srclist, my Sarge is monster now:(
2005-04-18T16:20:00.000Z	debiuntu		It's possible that i turn my debiuntu back to ubuntu base system?
2005-04-18T16:21:00.000Z	debiuntu		hmm.... :(
2005-04-18T16:21:00.000Z	gomez	debiuntu	you can force versions on everything but.. yuck
2005-04-18T16:21:00.000Z	debiuntu	gomez	how to do that?
2005-04-18T16:23:00.000Z	gomez	debiuntu	hmm... in synaptic you could remove all repositories but the ubuntu ones...
2005-04-18T16:24:00.000Z	gomez	debiuntu	then filter the installed list for local or obsolete packages and then force their versions to the ubuntu ones
2005-04-18T16:25:00.000Z	debiuntu	gomez	i used only ubuntu repositories when i update
2005-04-18T16:26:00.000Z	gomez	debiuntu	good, well it's just a cause of switching versions... or have I not understood your situation correctly?
2005-04-18T16:26:00.000Z	debiuntu	gomez	yep. i used pure debian before
2005-04-18T16:28:00.000Z	gomez	debiuntu	so you started with debian and then upgraded to ubuntu? (hoary?)
2005-04-18T16:29:00.000Z	debiuntu	gomez	yep. Sarge updated to hoary. I thinked the pure unbuntu is too huge for me
2005-04-18T16:32:00.000Z	gomez	debiuntu	if you know that much then you should be able to figure out your own mess :)
2005-04-18T16:34:00.000Z	debiuntu	gomez	but i suppose i don't :(   i think there must be a way to return to base system,but i have never tried it before
2005-04-18T16:34:00.000Z	gomez	debiuntu	just remove all the packages you've installed
2005-04-18T16:34:00.000Z	gomez	debiuntu	debfoster much help
2005-04-18T16:35:00.000Z	gomez	debiuntu	frankly, I'd take bob2's advice
2005-04-18T16:35:00.000Z	debiuntu	gomez	& bob2, thx a lot.
2005-04-18T16:36:00.000Z	gomez	debiuntu	no problem, I just popped in because I hadn't used IRC in ages and found nice client to try - I should really get back to work ;)
