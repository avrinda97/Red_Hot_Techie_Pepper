2009-11-18T16:51:00.000Z	talntid		hi all. can someone help me with networking? i have an install of ubuntu, but can't ping the gateway... or anything..... i *think* everything is setup right, but obviously something is off, because it doesn't work...
2009-11-18T16:51:00.000Z	talntid		ip address, broadcast, gateway are right, and routes are added
2009-11-18T16:51:00.000Z	talntid		Any ideas people?
2009-11-18T16:52:00.000Z	talntid		multiple times, epinky, router checked too

2009-11-18T16:55:00.000Z	epinky	talntid	is there ping on your ethernet address?
2009-11-18T16:55:00.000Z	epinky	talntid	other computer can ping gateway?
2009-11-18T16:56:00.000Z	epinky	talntid	what's its name, I mean eth0 , eth1, ath0?
2009-11-18T16:57:00.000Z	epinky	talntid	sudo ifconfig eth0 up
2009-11-18T16:57:00.000Z	epinky	talntid	sudo iptables -F
2009-11-18T16:58:00.000Z	epinky	talntid	do you have 2 NICS?
2009-11-18T16:59:00.000Z	epinky	talntid	then it sounds to me like a damaged NIC ... really odd
2009-11-18T17:00:00.000Z	talntid	epinky	works in my other ubuntu install, and in windows
2009-11-18T17:01:00.000Z	epinky	talntid	no idea man, if it pings eth0 then it's not about drivers neither kernel side
