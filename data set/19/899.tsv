2011-07-26T17:55:00.000Z	needzhelppz		is there anyway to change my mac address and be able to use the internet without rebooting?
2011-07-26T17:55:00.000Z	fmauro	needzhelppz	macchanger can assign mac addresses
2011-07-26T17:56:00.000Z	needzhelppz	fmauro	i'm running ubuntu from virtualbox btw
2011-07-26T17:56:00.000Z	fmauro	needzhelppz	what does ifconfig say
2011-07-26T17:58:00.000Z	fmauro	needzhelppz	have you tried addressing the device with ifconfig directly "ifconfig eth0 up && dhclient eth0"
2011-07-26T17:58:00.000Z	needzhelppz	fmauro	i did that then what am i supposed to do
2011-07-26T17:58:00.000Z	fmauro	needzhelppz	post the output of ifconfig here if possible
2011-07-26T18:06:00.000Z	needzhelppz	fmauro	here is the output of the command u told me: http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/811/unledbhp.png/
2011-07-26T18:08:00.000Z	fmauro	needzhelppz	it seems you have gotten an ip from the virtualbox NAT. try pinging a fixed ip like googles DNS server (8.8.8.8)
2011-07-26T18:09:00.000Z	fmauro	needzhelppz	ping 8.8.8.8
2011-07-26T18:11:00.000Z	needzhelppz	fmauro	it says unreachable wen i ping 8.8.8.8
2011-07-26T18:12:00.000Z	fmauro	needzhelppz	okay. the computer you're running Vbox on is the machine you are using right now to chat?
2011-07-26T18:13:00.000Z	fmauro	needzhelppz	alright, does this machine have several LAN ports?
2011-07-26T18:14:00.000Z	fmauro	needzhelppz	okay you need to check your adapter settings in VBox
2011-07-26T18:14:00.000Z	fmauro	needzhelppz	set it to bridged if you have to (at least for now) and be sure to select the active LANcontroller as the bridging device
2011-07-26T18:15:00.000Z	fmauro	needzhelppz	are you using VBox in linux?
2011-07-26T18:15:00.000Z	fmauro	needzhelppz	k then forget what I just said
2011-07-26T18:16:00.000Z	fmauro	needzhelppz	VBox probably has a problem with the adapter Mac not matching it's config in Vbox itself
2011-07-26T18:18:00.000Z	fmauro	needzhelppz	you were able to get a connection with the new mac before?
