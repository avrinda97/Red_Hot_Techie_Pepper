2011-01-16T06:36:00.000Z	checkalt666		there is something wrong with the connection to msn.
2011-01-16T06:36:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	checkalt666	exactly which program are you using to connect to MSN?
2011-01-16T06:37:00.000Z	checkalt666	psycho_oreos	right now i'm trying pidgin, but i already tested empathy, amsn and emesene
2011-01-16T06:38:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	checkalt666	you might be affected by the certificate error, if that's the case you might want to check out the link in #pidgin /topic as that will point out on how to import a certificate which will enable pidgin to work
2011-01-16T06:40:00.000Z	checkalt666	psycho_oreos	thank you. i'll try that
2011-01-16T06:40:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	checkalt666	nw
2011-01-16T06:49:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	checkalt666	you can't if you are running on an older version of ubuntu, the certificate fix should do it however
2011-01-16T06:50:00.000Z	checkalt666	psycho_oreos	oh dude, so sorry. thought i could express myself clearly in this channel.
2011-01-16T06:50:00.000Z	checkalt666	psycho_oreos	i'm using 10.10
2011-01-16T06:50:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	checkalt666	no need to swear however
2011-01-16T06:51:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	checkalt666	imo if you are trying to fix that certificate issue, it might be a good idea to try the it first rather than trying to update to the latest one.. I have managed to fix that with my xubuntu 9.04 and had no issues since
2011-01-16T06:52:00.000Z	checkalt666	psycho_oreos	i read the #pidgin topic and it says that i should update pidgin in order to fix it.
2011-01-16T06:53:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	checkalt666	try this link http://bit.ly/9Biw59
2011-01-16T06:59:00.000Z	checkalt666	psycho_oreos	 still cant. i updated the certificates and still cant log in my msn
2011-01-16T06:59:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	checkalt666	after trying intermediate certificates?
2011-01-16T06:59:00.000Z	checkalt666	psycho_oreos	 i could log in my other msn tough. i think this problem is happening because my msn ends with @gmail.com instead of @hotmail.com or @live.com
2011-01-16T06:59:00.000Z	checkalt666	psycho_oreos	yeah.
2011-01-16T07:00:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	checkalt666	weird, that might be the case then. What if you tried accounts with @msn or @hotmail?
2011-01-16T07:01:00.000Z	checkalt666	psycho_oreos	 i can log normally with @hotmail/live, but i cant with @gmail
