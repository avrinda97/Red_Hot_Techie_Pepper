2011-02-24T15:30:00.000Z	coraxx	Us3r_Unfriendly	ok ... I just gotta have that 'digital globe' as a background ...and be able to rotate the windows :-) ... will you share how/where you got it :) ?
2011-02-24T15:31:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	coraxx	I stole it from a russian website
2011-02-24T15:31:00.000Z	coraxx	Us3r_Unfriendly	cool :-)
2011-02-24T15:31:00.000Z	coraxx	Us3r_Unfriendly	that will teach 'em
2011-02-24T15:33:00.000Z	coraxx	Us3r_Unfriendly	seriously ...I did see the rotate window effect as something you could setup manually in compiz or somethin' .... but how did you do it ...was it simple....did you have to install suplemental packages ?
2011-02-24T15:33:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	coraxx	compiz yes, video wallpaper is a script at boot i wrote with mplayer and "xwinwrap"
2011-02-24T15:37:00.000Z	coraxx	Us3r_Unfriendly	ah ok
2011-02-24T15:37:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	coraxx	I also had to install compiz experimental plugins that you don't usually get to use.  Xwinwrap is running mplayer as my background
2011-02-24T15:38:00.000Z	coraxx	Us3r_Unfriendly	this workstation I'm using now is using the experimental compiz too ...the unstable one ...it works fine tho.
2011-02-24T15:38:00.000Z	coraxx	Us3r_Unfriendly	ditto on Raj007's question
2011-02-24T15:44:00.000Z	coraxx	Us3r_Unfriendly	I already have a setting-manager installed for compiz ...however I can't find anything in regards to spinning window ...do you know where it is and what the plugin is called ?
2011-02-24T15:44:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	coraxx	sudo apt-get install ccsm compiz-fusion-plugins-extra
2011-02-24T15:45:00.000Z	coraxx	Us3r_Unfriendly	already did that ..then what ?
2011-02-24T15:45:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	coraxx	enable having atleast 4 desktops screens on your machine.  then go to ccsm and enable the desktop cube, rotate cube, 3d windows and cube reflection and deformation
2011-02-24T15:46:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	coraxx	that's for the spinning world thing
2011-02-24T15:46:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	coraxx	i guess what are you trying to get with the compiz part?
2011-02-24T15:47:00.000Z	coraxx	Us3r_Unfriendly	the spinning part ....how do I activate it...maybe its already on ?
2011-02-24T15:48:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	coraxx	like the spinning terminal or the spinning desktops?
2011-02-24T15:48:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	coraxx	they're 2 different compiz plugins for that stuff
