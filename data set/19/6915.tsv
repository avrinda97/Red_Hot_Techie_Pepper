2007-11-17T05:42:00.000Z	LiquidHelium		When I start ubuntu all is fine, until about 10 minutes in my mouse will just stop, it wont move and no buttons work, if I unplug it and plug it in the Lazar, or whatever its called at the bottom of the mouse goes off, as to say its not plugged in. I tried installing the driver CD that came with the mouse, but its all .exe
2007-11-17T05:43:00.000Z	desertc	LiquidHelium	The mouse is controlled by X -- look into using a different configuration type
2007-11-17T05:44:00.000Z	LiquidHelium	desertc	im new to this whole linux thing, how would I go about doing that?
2007-11-17T05:44:00.000Z	desertc	LiquidHelium	No need for extra drivers.  Do you have a USB mouse?
2007-11-17T05:45:00.000Z	desertc	LiquidHelium	3 buttons?
2007-11-17T05:45:00.000Z	LiquidHelium	desertc	5
