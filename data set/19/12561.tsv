2008-11-22T18:22:00.000Z	Greencoat1982		I have kind of a long question here, I have two hd's 250gb and 1tb my system was installed on 250gb/sda I later added 1tb/sdb I formatted the entire sdb as the primary partition and only have the base partitions on sda....
2008-11-22T18:23:00.000Z	Greencoat1982		....is it possible to copy my filesystem to sdb, boot from a cd and reformat sda so that i can put a few more partitions in it, and then copy the filesystem back
2008-11-22T18:23:00.000Z	Chousuke	Greencoat1982	should be.
2008-11-22T18:23:00.000Z	Chousuke	Greencoat1982	however, you'll need to use the "archive" switch of cp so you don't mess up permissions
2008-11-22T18:24:00.000Z	Chousuke	Greencoat1982	what, the dev file?
2008-11-22T18:24:00.000Z	Chousuke	Greencoat1982	not quite.
2008-11-22T18:25:00.000Z	Chousuke	Greencoat1982	you could just back up your home dir, /etc, and reinstall
2008-11-22T18:26:00.000Z	Chousuke	Greencoat1982	is there anything that prevents you from just resizing the partitions?
2008-11-22T18:26:00.000Z	Chousuke	Greencoat1982	not quite.
2008-11-22T18:26:00.000Z	Chousuke	Greencoat1982	booted from a livecd?
2008-11-22T18:27:00.000Z	Chousuke	Greencoat1982	also, gparted will take a *long* time, depending on the size of the volume. be patient.
2008-11-22T18:27:00.000Z	Chousuke	Greencoat1982	the live cd will work
2008-11-22T18:28:00.000Z	Chousuke	Greencoat1982	just make sure none of the drives you're trying to edit are mounted.
2008-11-22T18:29:00.000Z	Chousuke	Greencoat1982	probably.
2008-11-22T18:29:00.000Z	Chousuke	Greencoat1982	depends on the filesystem
2008-11-22T18:33:00.000Z	Chousuke	Greencoat1982	yeah
2008-11-22T18:34:00.000Z	Chousuke	Greencoat1982	you could but you'd need to mount sda and sdb
2008-11-22T18:35:00.000Z	Chousuke	Greencoat1982	sure.
2008-11-22T18:35:00.000Z	Chousuke	Greencoat1982	any reason you can't install windows on sdb though?
