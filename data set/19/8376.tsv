2009-11-16T13:16:00.000Z	sjd		none know why Im dropped to the busybox while booting from live?
2009-11-16T13:17:00.000Z	ryanc_	sjd	busybox from a live cd?  are you sure the cd isn't bad?
2009-11-16T13:17:00.000Z	sjd	ryanc_	yes, I tried 3 live disc sent me from Canonical. But sometime ago once Jaunty was released I was able to live boot.
2009-11-16T13:18:00.000Z	ryanc_	sjd	if it's dropping you to busybox... what does it say before that?
2009-11-16T13:19:00.000Z	sjd	ryanc_	it shows the splash screen, then blac screen, "loading please wait" and then Welcome to Busy Box 1. something with Initramfs> prompt
2009-11-16T13:19:00.000Z	ryanc_	sjd	change the boot options when booting to disable the splashscreen and quiet mode
2009-11-16T13:20:00.000Z	sjd	ryanc_	how do i do that?
2009-11-16T13:20:00.000Z	ryanc_	sjd	if it's giving you an initramfs prompt then something is seriously wrong.
2009-11-16T13:20:00.000Z	ryanc_		either your hardware or your boot cd is messed up
2009-11-16T13:21:00.000Z	sjd	ryanc_	boot cd is fine i guess. because I tried three of them. but damn what is wrong?
2009-11-16T13:22:00.000Z	ryanc_	sjd	It's probably failing to mount the root filesystem on the cd
2009-11-16T13:22:00.000Z	sjd	ryanc_	can I do that manually?
2009-11-16T13:22:00.000Z	sjd	ryanc_	no solution?
2009-11-16T13:23:00.000Z	ryanc_	sjd	If it's failing, you need to see why somehow
2009-11-16T13:23:00.000Z	ryanc_		try running dmesg from busybox
2009-11-16T13:23:00.000Z	sjd	ryanc_	okay, i'l be back
