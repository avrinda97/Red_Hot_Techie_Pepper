2005-09-08T16:08:00.000Z	Cody`		Can anyone help me with the apache package? I have it all setup except for mod rewrite. I've disabled all virtual hosting and set the documentroot to /var/www instead. When using mod_rewrite in userdirs(via mod_userdir) mod_rewrite doesn't work. Here is what error.log says [Fri Sep 02 17:53:54 2005]  [error]  [client 127.0.0.1]  File does not exist: /var/www/home, referer: http://localhost/~cody/osdever/forum.php?page_id= as you can see, it looks i

2005-09-08T16:09:00.000Z	Cody`		any ideas?
2005-09-08T16:09:00.000Z	Seveas	Cody`	put your .htaccess  or relevant section of config files on the pastebin
2005-09-08T16:11:00.000Z	Cody`	Seveas	one sec then
2005-09-08T16:12:00.000Z	Cody`	Seveas	http://rafb.net/paste/results/3lEcvd59.html
2005-09-08T16:14:00.000Z	Seveas	Cody`	I see no mod_rewrite stuff in there
2005-09-08T16:14:00.000Z	Cody`	Seveas	RewriteEngine On is set in rewrite.conf
2005-09-08T16:14:00.000Z	Seveas	Cody`	not having a monospaced font for <pre> is what I meant with funky things ;)
2005-09-08T16:15:00.000Z	Seveas	Cody`	and what is your RewriteBase and your RewriteRules?
2005-09-08T16:16:00.000Z	Cody`	Seveas	That exact .htaccess worked on my freebsd server before the harddrive went out, along with two other servers...
2005-09-08T16:16:00.000Z	Seveas	Cody`	you're missing a RewriteBase
2005-09-08T16:18:00.000Z	Cody`	Seveas	it's already available
2005-09-08T16:18:00.000Z	Seveas	Cody`	rigghht
2005-09-29T09:33:00.000Z	Seveas	Cody`	don't

2005-10-01T13:02:00.000Z	Cody`	Seveas	thanks, wasn't sure as I had nuked an install with backports kernels before :P
2005-10-25T15:32:00.000Z	Seveas	Cody`	java.sun.com
