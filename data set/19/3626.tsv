2009-07-05T11:28:00.000Z	SnakDoc	shift_	u saying you have 50 running and thats to much ?
2009-07-05T11:29:00.000Z	shift_	SnakDoc	no, it's actually 172 and yes 50 would still be too much. I would use gentoo, but it's a pain to configure on my laptop. Ubuntu has better support by default.
2009-07-05T11:29:00.000Z	SnakDoc	shift_	how much ram are you using ?
2009-07-05T11:30:00.000Z	shift_	SnakDoc	470mb
2009-07-05T11:30:00.000Z	shift_	SnakDoc	out of 933
2009-07-05T11:30:00.000Z	SnakDoc	shift_	my server got 159 open using 109 and pc has 232 using 559mb
2009-07-05T11:31:00.000Z	SnakDoc	shift_	you really think half that bad ?? i just asking last time i had windows xp up i was using 1 gb
2009-07-05T11:32:00.000Z	SnakDoc	shift_	but to answer you question ubuntu-tweaks may have a few features you like also system > pref > startup application gives you options to pick about start up files
2009-07-05T11:34:00.000Z	shift_	SnakDoc	well here's the thing... when I had gentoo on here, everything would open almost instantly, after switching to kubuntu, a right click takes 5 seconds for the pop up menu to open sometimes. I just want a minimalistic system without having to fiddle with hardware drivers.
2009-07-05T11:35:00.000Z	SnakDoc	shift_	i have to say i ran KDE for a while was slow for me
2009-07-05T11:35:00.000Z	SnakDoc	shift_	you tried gnome by chance ??
2009-07-05T11:36:00.000Z	SnakDoc	shift_	i have 1.8 dual core and 2 gb of ram and i thought kububntu was sluggish
2009-07-05T11:36:00.000Z	shift_	SnakDoc	I used it 'back in the day', and haven't touched it since, but it seems to have come a long way though.... no harm in trying I guess.
2009-07-05T11:37:00.000Z	SnakDoc	shift_	you should be able to sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop and get it
2009-07-05T11:37:00.000Z	SnakDoc	shift_	anything worth a try :D
2009-07-05T11:39:00.000Z	SnakDoc	shift_	let me know if you think xubuntu-desktop i believe should install that for you
2009-07-05T11:40:00.000Z	shift_	SnakDoc	I did apt-get install xubuntu-desktop and removed kubuntu-desktop, but that didn't get rid of all the kde stuff after autoremove..... so I think just reinstalling from scratch is the way to go now.
2009-07-05T11:42:00.000Z	SnakDoc	shift_	just do sudo apt-get remove kdelibs4c2 kdelibs5-dat
2009-07-05T11:43:00.000Z	SnakDoc	shift_	you must like formating more than me then good luck
