2007-07-06T11:47:00.000Z	bobbob1016		I'm trying to get seamless working, following this guide http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=433359&highlight=seamless+virtualbox but I still see the background.  Any ideas?
2007-07-06T11:48:00.000Z	Trojaneyez	bobbob1016	you are using XP, and you are using the Welcome screen and fast switch user settings right?
2007-07-06T11:49:00.000Z	bobbob1016	Trojaneyez	XP yes, the rest I don't know, I followed the guide, except for the start with Ubuntu stuff
2007-07-06T11:50:00.000Z	Trojaneyez	bobbob1016	well ok the first thing is get in the VXP machine and go to control panel user control, and click on Control way user's log in and out
2007-07-06T11:50:00.000Z	Trojaneyez	bobbob1016	you want it to have welcome screen clicked, and fast user switch clicked
2007-07-06T11:50:00.000Z	bobbob1016	Trojaneyez	oh, auto-login?
2007-07-06T11:50:00.000Z	Trojaneyez	bobbob1016	no not auto logon
2007-07-06T11:50:00.000Z	Trojaneyez	bobbob1016	hold on i'll screen shot it all for you
2007-07-06T11:51:00.000Z	bobbob1016	Trojaneyez	that I didn't see, one second
2007-07-06T11:52:00.000Z	bobbob1016	Trojaneyez	they are both checked, Welcome and Fast User
2007-07-06T11:52:00.000Z	Trojaneyez	bobbob1016	ok what part of all this is not working?
2007-07-06T11:52:00.000Z	Trojaneyez	bobbob1016	are you able to rdp into the xp machine?
2007-07-06T11:53:00.000Z	bobbob1016	Trojaneyez	I see the desktop background from the VXP, I thought it'd be seamless
2007-07-06T11:53:00.000Z	Trojaneyez	bobbob1016	a Domain Controller i mean
2007-07-06T11:54:00.000Z	bobbob1016	Trojaneyez	I don't know what that is, so I'd assume it isn't
2007-07-06T11:55:00.000Z	Trojaneyez	bobbob1016	i'd assume it isn't either ;) .. ok what is the command you are using from ubuntu to connect, leave out user name and password
2007-07-06T11:56:00.000Z	bobbob1016	Trojaneyez	rdesktop -rsound -A -s "c:\seamlessrdp\seamlessrdpshell.exe C:\Windows\explorer.exe" 192.168.0.45:3389 -u "user" -p password
2007-07-06T11:56:00.000Z	Trojaneyez	bobbob1016	have you tried the remote execute command with single quotes?
2007-07-06T11:58:00.000Z	bobbob1016	Trojaneyez	yeah, it gives an error, so I'd think the quotes are needed
