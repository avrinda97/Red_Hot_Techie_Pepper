2010-01-20T20:07:00.000Z	Dontkillme		Hello. I acciedenly wiped my hard disc and lost my linux. Is there a way to get it back?
2010-01-20T20:08:00.000Z	MrUnix	Dontkillme	how did you wipe your HDD?
2010-01-20T20:08:00.000Z	Dontkillme	MrUnix	With Paragon Disk Wiper - I wanted to test it...
2010-01-20T20:09:00.000Z	MrUnix	Dontkillme	you did a full wipe?
2010-01-20T20:09:00.000Z	Dontkillme	MrUnix	Yes. I wanted to test the program.
2010-01-20T20:10:00.000Z	MrUnix	Dontkillme	then you're going to need a pristinely clean electronics lab, a very powerful electron microscope, and a team of top-notch forensic's experts.
2010-01-20T20:10:00.000Z	MrUnix	Dontkillme	Do you know about applications such as Virtualbox?
2010-01-20T20:10:00.000Z	Dontkillme	MrUnix	No
2010-01-20T20:11:00.000Z	MrUnix	Dontkillme	well now consider you've learned a lesson. Don't experiment on your own HDD. When you reinstall Linux make sure you download Virtualbox or some similar application and test stuff there.
2010-01-20T20:12:00.000Z	Dontkillme	MrUnix	Oh, I only wanted to test the program... My HDD was full with programs... Does my hard drive get heavier when I put more data on it?
2010-01-20T20:13:00.000Z	MrUnix	Dontkillme	I don't understand - you mean physically?
2010-01-20T20:13:00.000Z	Dontkillme	MrUnix	Yes, I do.
2010-01-20T20:14:00.000Z	MrUnix	Dontkillme	well data stored on an HDD is essentially electromagnetic pulses so - no.
2010-01-20T20:15:00.000Z	MrUnix	Dontkillme	Paragon will have written over them completely. They no longer exist.
2010-01-20T20:18:00.000Z	MrUnix	Dontkillme	Apart from the electron microscope? Reinstallation
2010-01-20T20:19:00.000Z	MrUnix	Dontkillme	lesson of the day - testing stuff on your HDD != win.
2010-01-20T20:20:00.000Z	Dontkillme	MrUnix	It's the 4th time since I've got this computer
2010-01-20T20:20:00.000Z	MrUnix	Dontkillme	I've rebuilt an OS on this computer I'm on at least twenty times by now. You'll get used to it.
2010-01-20T20:21:00.000Z	MrUnix	Dontkillme	don't troll.
