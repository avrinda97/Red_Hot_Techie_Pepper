2006-03-13T12:48:00.000Z	joanverde		I would like to mount a nfs+ drive as rw; how could I do that when it mounts as ro by deafault?
2006-03-13T12:49:00.000Z	me2win	joanverde	did you make sure that you have something that makes it safe to write first?
2006-03-13T12:50:00.000Z	joanverde	me2win	what do you mean safe?
2006-03-13T12:52:00.000Z	me2win	joanverde	it isnt safe to write to an NTFS partition from linux
2006-03-13T12:52:00.000Z	joanverde	me2win	it's hfs+ and not ntfs
2006-03-13T12:53:00.000Z	me2win	joanverde	my bad, small font
2006-03-13T12:53:00.000Z	joanverde		no problem
2006-03-13T12:53:00.000Z	me2win	joanverde	oh you put nfs
2006-03-13T12:53:00.000Z	me2win		thats why
2006-03-13T12:53:00.000Z	joanverde		hfs+
2006-03-13T12:53:00.000Z	me2win	joanverde	  <joanverde> I would like to mount a nfs+ drive as rw;
2006-03-13T12:53:00.000Z	joanverde		or hsf+ I use to mix them, the later for mac anyhow
2006-03-13T12:53:00.000Z	joanverde		HFS+
2006-03-13T12:54:00.000Z	me2win	joanverde	i know, but when you first said what you were trying to do, you put nfs+ by accident, instead of hfs
2006-03-13T12:54:00.000Z	joanverde		ok, sorry
2006-03-13T12:56:00.000Z	joanverde		so me2win, could you make something up? if you have a soulotion we could take it in the #ubuntu-offtopic
2006-03-13T12:56:00.000Z	me2win	joanverde	im not sure how to mount hfs for rw
2006-03-13T12:57:00.000Z	joanverde		ok me2win
2006-03-13T12:57:00.000Z	joanverde	me2win	could it help to see the fdisk or fstab file?
