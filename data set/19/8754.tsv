2007-02-13T06:10:00.000Z	Fedman		I have problems playing .mov files. I've installed all the codecs from automatix and still get the no stream error in mplayer
2007-02-13T06:11:00.000Z	Fedman		any ideas what I can be doing wrong
2007-02-13T06:12:00.000Z	erUSUL	Fedman	automatix is a black box for most of us... we can not know what it has done wrong...
2007-02-13T06:14:00.000Z	Fedman	erUSUL	I've tried installing all the codecs from the repositories before using automatix including the bad and ugly ones
2007-02-13T06:14:00.000Z	erUSUL	Fedman	for mov files you need w32codecs afaik
2007-02-13T06:16:00.000Z	erUSUL	Fedman	no problem
2007-02-13T06:28:00.000Z	erUSUL	Fedman	it works for me... i do not know what can be wrong...
2007-02-13T06:31:00.000Z	Fedman	erUSUL	uh sorry I'm dumb it's working now :)
2007-02-13T06:31:00.000Z	erUSUL	Fedman	no problem
2007-10-09T10:34:00.000Z	erUSUL	Fedman	why do you say that bundle driver are out of date?
2007-10-09T10:36:00.000Z	Fedman	erUSUL	the drivers in the kernel are an older version and the external storage I'm connecting to the HBA doesn't want to work on UTRA320 speed
2007-10-09T10:38:00.000Z	Fedman	erUSUL	and I got a response from technical support from adaptec that I should update it with the ones on the promise webpage but I don't know how to apply the source code to the kernel
2007-10-09T10:41:00.000Z	erUSUL	Fedman	i have dl the drivers and afaics you have to replace the folder drivers/scsi/aic7xxx of the kernel sources with the one you dl from the website
2007-10-09T10:41:00.000Z	Fedman	erUSUL	I tried it but I got an error when I tried to compile it
2007-10-09T10:41:00.000Z	erUSUL	Fedman	:(
2007-10-09T10:42:00.000Z	erUSUL	Fedman	which version of ubuntu are you using?
2007-10-09T10:42:00.000Z	Fedman	erUSUL	7.04 server
2007-10-09T10:44:00.000Z	erUSUL	Fedman	pretty recent i thought you were using dapper... my next advice is to download the gutsy server kernel and try it
2007-10-09T10:44:00.000Z	erUSUL	Fedman	can you post the error you are getting on a pastebin (compiling)
