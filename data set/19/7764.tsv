2007-07-19T05:42:00.000Z	Lorne_Kun|Laptop		can installing windows xp mess up grub even if the drive that grub is on is unplugged during the windows install?
2007-07-19T05:43:00.000Z	Lorne_Kun|Laptop		because i unplugged the drive that grub is on (the drive that has ubuntu on it) during my xp install, but now i get "Grub loading stage 1.5"ReadError

2007-07-19T05:44:00.000Z	Lorne_Kun|Laptop		because all i did was unplug the power >.>
2007-07-19T05:45:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Lorne_Kun|Laptop	why did you unplug the ub drive for the xp install
2007-07-19T05:45:00.000Z	Lorne_Kun|Laptop	Jack_Sparrow	because its the drive that windows wanted to install ITS boot loader too
2007-07-19T05:46:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Lorne_Kun|Laptop	Sorry to come in late on this.. I take it you now do not have access to grub and ubuntu
2007-07-19T05:49:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Lorne_Kun|Laptop	SO it dosent have grub in the mbr...
2007-07-19T05:50:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Lorne_Kun|Laptop	Have you gone through the instructions for repairing grub after installing windows?
2007-07-19T05:51:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Lorne_Kun|Laptop	You should have left it connected
2007-07-19T05:52:00.000Z	Lorne_Kun|Laptop	Jack_Sparrow	would it be easier to copy ubuntu onto another PATA drive so i dont have to cope with a sata/pata mixture?
2007-07-19T05:52:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Lorne_Kun|Laptop	I have never mixed those but I cant see that it matters that much.
2007-07-19T05:53:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Lorne_Kun|Laptop	It looks like you need to get grub into the mbr of the windows drive ... was that drive in place when you installed ubuntu
2007-07-19T05:56:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Lorne_Kun|Laptop	Can you give me a minute to start a pot of coffee?
2007-07-19T05:57:00.000Z	Lorne_Kun|Laptop	Jack_Sparrow	can this be fixed by manually editing grub's boot list?
2007-07-19T05:57:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Lorne_Kun|Laptop	that and instlling grub into the mbr yes
2007-07-19T06:18:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Lorne_Kun|Laptop	leave everything connected and reinstall ubuntu
