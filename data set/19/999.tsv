2012-01-08T03:02:00.000Z	LABcrab	guntbert	i asked twice about Chromium not working with Alt-Tab and the sidebar!
2012-01-08T03:02:00.000Z	guntbert	LABcrab	yes, but thats no reason to talk about non support questions here - please :)
2012-01-08T03:06:00.000Z	guntbert	LABcrab	here it does
2012-01-08T03:07:00.000Z	LABcrab	guntbert	and AlanBell: others, yes.  Chromium, when i press on the Dock button, opens a new window instead of going to the opened window.  Also, Alt-Tab doesn't show Chromium.
2012-01-08T03:07:00.000Z	guntbert	LABcrab	how did you install chromium?
2012-01-08T03:09:00.000Z	guntbert	LABcrab	in any case through the ubuntu software system
2012-01-08T03:09:00.000Z	LABcrab	guntbert	That way is preferable?
2012-01-08T03:10:00.000Z	guntbert	LABcrab	both methods are essentially equal - do you have unity or unity 2D?
2012-01-08T03:10:00.000Z	LABcrab	guntbert	3D, computer has an HDMI port, uses built-in laptop screen, no problems with Video.
2012-01-08T03:11:00.000Z	guntbert	LABcrab	then I really have no idea, sorry   .... hmm, try to remove the icon from the launcher and re-add it
2012-01-08T03:12:00.000Z	LABcrab	guntbert	Once it leaves the Dock, it never comes back.
2012-01-08T03:13:00.000Z	guntbert	LABcrab	you can drag it from the lens
2012-01-08T03:14:00.000Z	LABcrab	guntbert	?
2012-01-08T03:16:00.000Z	guntbert	LABcrab	if you open the lens, you select internet, then you should be able to drag the chromium icon to the launcher
2012-01-08T03:17:00.000Z	LABcrab	guntbert	Nice attempt.  What happens is that the icon just disappears when i drop it on the Dock.  Launching it also doesn't make it appear on the Dock.
2012-01-08T03:18:00.000Z	guntbert	LABcrab	then I have really no idea - sorry
2012-01-08T03:20:00.000Z	LABcrab	guntbert	No worries.  It's just that those Ubuntu glitches really bug me.
