2006-09-29T07:36:00.000Z	sbalneav	mikeo1	What are you upgrading from, and to?
2006-09-29T07:37:00.000Z	sbalneav	mikeo1	I would rename the folder.
2006-09-29T07:37:00.000Z	sbalneav	mikeo1	And file a bug.
2006-09-29T07:38:00.000Z	sbalneav	mikeo1	Easy, just go the launchpad.net.
2006-09-29T07:44:00.000Z	sbalneav	mikeo1	What steps exactly did you take to perform the upgrade?
2006-09-29T07:45:00.000Z	sbalneav	mikeo1	Well, I'd say there's an upgrade bug in the x11-common package.
2006-09-29T07:46:00.000Z	sbalneav	mikeo1	You followed the part of the guide that said you should have backups, right?
2006-09-29T07:47:00.000Z	sbalneav	mikeo1	The part of the guide right at the top that says: "Do not upgrade to Edgy on your primary workstation - At least, please backup important data!"
2006-09-29T07:49:00.000Z	sbalneav	mikeo1	Simple.
