2007-07-08T10:41:00.000Z	pguser		I burned a desktop cd and I'm getting squashfs errors.
2007-07-08T10:42:00.000Z	pguser		i checked to make sure the iso md5 checksum matched and it did
2007-07-08T10:42:00.000Z	pguser		is 7.04 a buggy POS?
2007-07-08T10:43:00.000Z	pguser		ubuntu is the first linux distro I couldn't even install
2007-07-08T10:43:00.000Z	pguser		it is that bad
2007-07-08T10:44:00.000Z	pguser		why am i getting squashfs errors in the year 2007!
2007-07-08T10:44:00.000Z	pguser		i set pci=noacpi and it didn't fix it either
2007-07-08T10:46:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	pguser	try F6 and adding the command noapic to the boot line
2007-07-08T10:59:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	pguser	where does it hang or what does it do.
2007-07-08T10:59:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	pguser	It isn't... there is just such diversity in hardware...
2007-07-08T11:00:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	pguser	What is your hardware..
2007-07-08T11:00:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	pguser	I have had lots that would not install
2007-07-08T11:03:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	pguser	I have had Dells using a verified good cd not install until I took it and reburned it at a lower speed.. No reason for it but that fixed that particular problem
2007-07-08T11:04:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	pguser	do you have the iso on one of your computers?
2007-07-08T11:05:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	pguser	That is similar to the loop I was getting on the Dells
2007-07-08T11:05:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	pguser	This may sound stupid... but burn the ISO at a very slow speed and retry..
2007-07-08T11:07:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	pguser	what os are you using to burn the iso to a disk
2007-07-08T11:08:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	pguser	PLease humor me... it will only cost you a dime
2007-07-08T11:12:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	pguser	isorecorder for windows is free
