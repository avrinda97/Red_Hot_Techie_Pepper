2007-06-25T06:19:00.000Z	drowner		hello all
2007-06-25T06:19:00.000Z	drowner		i was wanting a bit of generic advice
2007-06-25T06:19:00.000Z	drowner		i want to create a seperate /home partition
2007-06-25T06:19:00.000Z	dawn`chorus	drowner	what's on your mind?
2007-06-25T06:20:00.000Z	drowner		and i found psychocats' guide, which is sensational
2007-06-25T06:20:00.000Z	drowner		but i would like to know what this line means before i type it in (/new refers to the new home folder, we are currently in the old /home)
2007-06-25T06:20:00.000Z	drowner		find . -depth -print0 | sudo cpio --null --sparse -pvd /new/
2007-06-25T06:21:00.000Z	dawn`chorus	drowner	that's called "magic pixie dust".
2007-06-25T06:21:00.000Z	drowner	dawn`chorus	pardon?
2007-06-25T06:21:00.000Z	drowner		lol
2007-06-25T06:22:00.000Z	dawn`chorus	drowner	i'm only kidding.  if you really want to learn you could search online for those commands, or read their man pages.  man find.  man cpio
2007-06-25T06:22:00.000Z	drowner	dawn`chorus	i DID that., but its the combination that is confusing me
2007-06-25T06:22:00.000Z	dawn`chorus	drowner	do you know what a 'pipe' is?
2007-06-25T06:23:00.000Z	drowner	dawn`chorus	yeah i think so. it takes the outpur of one command and sticks it in another?
2007-06-25T06:23:00.000Z	drowner		outpuT
2007-06-25T06:23:00.000Z	dawn`chorus	drowner	exactly.  it redirects the output of a command from standard output (your screen) and turns it into the input (which would usually be your keyboard strokes) of the next command.
2007-06-25T06:27:00.000Z	drowner	dawn`chorus	Ok, i think i know what the 'find' command does
2007-06-25T06:27:00.000Z	drowner	dawn`chorus	 But im not sure why we need to cpio. Like, why not just cp it?
2007-06-25T06:28:00.000Z	dawn`chorus	drowner	aysiu must've thought that working w/ the archives was easier/more efficient/etc.
