2005-12-15T16:57:00.000Z	sangriag	ntldr	if you are usig kde, guarddog is a good firewall. The best is to use iptables
2005-12-15T16:57:00.000Z	ntldr		and for traffic shaping?
2005-12-15T16:59:00.000Z	ntldr		typical proxy is squid, right?

2005-12-15T17:03:00.000Z	sangriag	ntldr	it depends on your network structure.
2005-12-15T17:04:00.000Z	sangriag		btw anyone who knows how to get into the ppc bios? pressing C and other optios does not help
2005-12-15T17:04:00.000Z	ntldr	sangriag	it's a basic green+red config. It should support like 40 PCs
2005-12-15T17:04:00.000Z	ntldr		I just don't know which packages to install for that
2005-12-15T17:08:00.000Z	ntldr		i will
