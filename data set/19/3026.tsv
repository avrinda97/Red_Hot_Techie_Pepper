2010-11-10T10:30:00.000Z	greezmunkey	YankDownUnder	check out post #6 here: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nautilus/+bug/631740
2010-11-10T10:31:00.000Z	greezmunkey	YankDownUnder	then read on... I think it will help you.
2010-11-10T10:32:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	greezmunkey	Ta - this is basically the issue - as I have it. Rather strange that this isn't being addressed fast enough but.
2010-11-10T10:33:00.000Z	greezmunkey	YankDownUnder	It looks like the fix may be adding the line as in post #6, as the later posts indicate. This solution was nominated as a fix for the bug.
2010-11-10T10:36:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	greezmunkey	Oddly enough, just checked all my workstations/servers here, and they're apparently all fine - the line already exists.
2010-11-10T10:37:00.000Z	greezmunkey	YankDownUnder	yet the problem still exists??
2010-11-10T10:38:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	greezmunkey	Si, Oui, Ja, Da, Yes. :)
2010-11-10T10:42:00.000Z	greezmunkey	YankDownUnder	Have you been able to locate any specific information in your log files?
2010-11-10T10:46:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	greezmunkey	Apparently, the "proper" fix is to upgrade from gvfs-1.6.1 to gvfs-1.6.3 or 1.6.4 => to which all deps on gvfs are broken... :) Lovely that, eh!
2010-11-10T10:48:00.000Z	greezmunkey	YankDownUnder	I found two things that may interest you. Essentially the messaging is broken. Something called Dolphin (rather than Nautlius) seems to work better with CIFS shares than does Nautilus. You test that out...
2010-11-10T10:49:00.000Z	greezmunkey	YankDownUnder	hmm, the sentence should have been: You can try testing that out. (new keyboard, sorry)
2010-11-10T10:49:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	greezmunkey	I'd love to, however, that would entail a mass migration for me (here at home) and then all my clients - no can do. And yes, I've been trying for the past few days to find a fix for this, and it all appears to boil down to simply gvfs
2010-11-10T10:55:00.000Z	greezmunkey	YankDownUnder	Yikes, man. I wish I had an answer for you on that.
2010-11-10T10:55:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	greezmunkey	hehehehehe...yeah - so do I - however, it's now a puzzle that requires solving. Either the community will resolve the issue, or I'll have to think of a quicksmart way of resolving it myself (more than just a few computers/servers to deal with - like way more)
2010-11-10T11:04:00.000Z	greezmunkey	YankDownUnder	I was just looking into what it takes to "remove" Nautilus, and still keep the system operating properly...I understand now why you don't want to do it.
2010-11-10T11:05:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	greezmunkey	Hehehehehe...yeah - lovely that, eh! As I said, now it's a "puzzle" to be solved...not merely a problem...hehehehehe...yet another reason to make sure there is beer on hand for this... :)
2010-11-10T11:08:00.000Z	greezmunkey	YankDownUnder	About the only common thread I can find to side step the issue is to use midnight commander, mc or the like to move files to and from shares.
2010-11-10T11:22:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	greezmunkey	Currently, my "simple" resolution is to create a script for users workstations that runs on login to mount the smb shares on the network; that's the "bandage" (or Microsoft solution); I'll make a permanent resolution after the application of large quantities of alcoholic substances (i.e., beer)
2010-11-10T11:23:00.000Z	greezmunkey	YankDownUnder	That's the, er...spirit!
