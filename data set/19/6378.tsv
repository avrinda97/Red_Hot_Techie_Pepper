2008-02-04T03:51:00.000Z	iKap		is it bad to use the "sudo halt" or "sudo shutdown -h now" or "sudo reboot"? to shutdown/restart your machine?
2008-02-04T03:52:00.000Z	soundray	iKap	no
2008-02-04T03:53:00.000Z	soundray	iKap	it doesn't get any more proper
2008-02-04T03:59:00.000Z	iKap	soundray	then would eth0 turn back on when i power the comp back up?
2008-02-04T03:54:00.000Z	iKap	soundray	does it do same kind of shutdown that the GUI would do, if i were to hit the red power switch and select shutdown? i just want to make sure.
2008-02-04T03:54:00.000Z	soundray	iKap	yes, it's the same
2008-02-04T03:55:00.000Z	iKap	soundray	okay because i hate the GUI way of shutting down dont know why but i just do lol, also so stick with "sudo halt" then?
2008-02-04T03:55:00.000Z	soundray	iKap	I can't see a problem with that, other than that you might lose any open documents
2008-02-04T03:55:00.000Z	iKap	soundray	well i would close and save everything then shut down.
2008-02-04T03:58:00.000Z	iKap	soundray	well im just looking to use a command that does a PROPER shutdown like the GUI shutdown button would. thats all.
2008-02-04T03:58:00.000Z	soundray	iKap	for a workaround, put a script in /usr/local/bin that calls 'ifconfig eth0 down', then 'shutdown -h now' and use that to shutdown.
2008-02-04T04:00:00.000Z	soundray	iKap	sorry, I meant eth1 like in your example. Yes, booting will return everything to what it was.
2008-02-04T04:00:00.000Z	iKap	soundray	can u you help me do that, since i am kind of a newb lol and not sure how to do what you just explained.
2008-02-04T04:01:00.000Z	iKap	soundray	also.. would doing a GUI shutdown turn off eth1 as well? or would i have to turn off through terminal?
2008-02-04T04:02:00.000Z	soundray	iKap	'gksudo gedit /usr/local/bin/myhalt' to edit the script. Three lines: first '#!/bin/bash', then 'ifconfig eth1 down', then 'shutdown -h now'. Save the file and 'sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/myhalt'. Then you can shutdown with 'sudo myhalt'
2008-02-04T04:04:00.000Z	iKap	soundray	is there a way to do this, so when i shut down using GUI button it will do the same?
2008-02-04T04:05:00.000Z	soundray	iKap	I'm sure there is, but I don't know the location of the shutdown script that the gnome button runs
2008-02-04T04:09:00.000Z	iKap	soundray	someone told me its located in /etc/acpi/
2008-02-04T04:10:00.000Z	soundray	iKap	I don't think that's correct
