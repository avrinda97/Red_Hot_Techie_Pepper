2008-05-14T08:26:00.000Z	doseryder	grimlock838	yep.  and i've correctly entered the right passphrase
2008-05-14T08:28:00.000Z	doseryder	grimlock838	hang on one sec.   i managed to see sometihng different, its asking me to create a "Default Keyring" what ever that means
2008-05-14T08:29:00.000Z	doseryder	grimlock838	btw, did i thank you for your attention to my question :>
2008-05-14T08:33:00.000Z	doseryder	grimlock838	as corny/noobie as it sounds, i'm actually making notes right now.  I like to document these things
2008-05-14T08:41:00.000Z	doseryder	grimlock838	it is asking me to create a password for the keyring, should that be my network key to my wireless network?  What exactly is a keyring?
2008-05-14T08:45:00.000Z	doseryder	grimlock838	okay, i guess the password its asking me to create is a password for the keyring, so with that password, i have access to all the passwords associated with other wireless networks (or passwords to access various programs too, perhaps??)
2008-05-14T08:50:00.000Z	doseryder	grimlock838	Yay, it worked i have internet.  Man.. i have so much to do tonight.  I'll prolly need to stay up all night.  Install it on my laptop shouldn't take long.  I still gotta install ubuntu on my desktop.  The sh*tty part is, gutsy doesn't support my wireless network usb adapter, I think that'll take me sometime to figure out
2008-05-14T08:52:00.000Z	doseryder	grimlock838	anyways, i got internet now on my laptop thats a good start.  thx dude.  may need your help with my desktop later if you still around
2008-05-14T08:53:00.000Z	doseryder	grimlock838	i'm installing gutsy right now, is hardy another ubuntu release?
2008-05-14T08:55:00.000Z	doseryder	grimlock838	do u (and can I) want me to add you on instant messenger or something?
2008-05-14T09:00:00.000Z	doseryder	grimlock838	in that case, i might as well download hardy heron.  are you on msn?
2008-05-14T09:02:00.000Z	doseryder	grimlock838	I got this usb wireless adapter by TP-LINK.  I hope Hardy supports it
