2009-07-01T17:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Halitech	it doesnt have the graphics settings like it did pre-gutsy but will set the video to failsafes
2009-07-01T17:08:00.000Z	Halitech	ActionParsnip1	but most people are in failsafe which sucks due to something not communicating back info and makes it hard to manually configure xorg to get it to work
2009-07-01T17:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Halitech	then read you xorg log in /var/log and see whats going on
2009-07-01T17:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Halitech	run:    less /var/log/Xorg.0.log

2009-08-12T17:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Halitech	if you read it its not hugely complex
2009-08-12T17:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Halitech	make a folder, move to the folder, download file, extract file, remove file
2009-08-12T17:18:00.000Z	Halitech	ActionParsnip1	no its not, but remembering the file names to download could be
2009-08-12T17:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Halitech	i guess, its just the atr.gz instead of deb. Its how i install flash. i got one for 64bit java too but i didnt write it
