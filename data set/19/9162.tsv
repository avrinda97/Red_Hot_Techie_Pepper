2008-09-21T09:08:00.000Z	Flannel		zenwryly: Don't put yourself in the root group.
2008-09-21T09:08:00.000Z	Flannel		zenwryly: use sudo instead.
2008-09-21T09:09:00.000Z	zenwryly	Flannel	why?
2008-09-21T09:09:00.000Z	zenwryly	Flannel	I mean I use sudo for many things
2008-09-21T09:09:00.000Z	zenwryly	Flannel	but I'd like to understand why being in the root group is bad?
2008-09-21T09:09:00.000Z	Flannel	zenwryly	Because giving yourself root group access is potentially as bad as running as root half the time.
2008-09-21T09:10:00.000Z	zenwryly	Flannel	hmm, yeah I guess I can see that.  Thanks!  :)
2008-09-21T09:11:00.000Z	Flannel	zenwryly	That's the root users group (just like you have a group for your own user)
2008-09-21T09:12:00.000Z	zenwryly	Flannel	yeah, I understood that
2009-08-03T11:27:00.000Z	Flannel	zenwryly	I think sensible-editor is the debian alternative (which honors $EDITOR by default, I believe)
2009-08-03T11:28:00.000Z	zenwryly	Flannel	hmm, not on my two ubuntu systems.  Know whee this is done so I can see if I did anything that changed it?
2009-08-03T11:28:00.000Z	Flannel	zenwryly	What's not on your systems? sensible-editor honoring $EDITOR?
2009-08-03T11:30:00.000Z	zenwryly	Flannel	oh!  I see.  Hmm.  I'm thinking the other way around.  I have update-alternatives set /usr/bin/editor for my favorite, I was wondering why one of the startup or login files doesn't export EIDTOR=/usr/bin/editor to integrate it with alternatives
2009-08-03T11:30:00.000Z	zenwryly	Flannel	what does sensible-* get us over the above?
2009-08-03T11:31:00.000Z	Flannel	zenwryly	http://www.ubuntugeek.com/howto-select-per-user-editor-in-ubuntu-810-intrepid.html  You can set it system wide (or on a per-user basis), you could include an export in your bashrc easily enough.
2009-08-03T11:32:00.000Z	zenwryly	Flannel	ah, yeah, per-user, that makes sense
2009-08-03T11:32:00.000Z	zenwryly	Flannel	thanks
2009-08-03T11:32:00.000Z	Flannel	zenwryly	It also makes it integrate nicely with the package manager.  When you add a new editor, it shows up in the list, etc (the sensible-* that is)
2009-08-03T11:35:00.000Z	zenwryly	Flannel	yeah, thakns that's exactly the information I was looking for.  Makes a lot of sense now.  Since I have a single user system I can just was well make /usr/bin/editor my favorite and export EDITOR to it and I have a global default, while other systems can change it per-user gracefully
