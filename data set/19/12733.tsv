2008-01-25T14:00:00.000Z	travisat		well to be honest I haven't had any problems with it yet, but I don't use a printer, and I haven't really bothered with the gnome config tools
2008-01-25T14:01:00.000Z	travisat		wait thats not true I had problems installing it
2008-01-25T14:01:00.000Z	travisat		wouldn't detect my hard drive, had to install windows on it first and then it would
2008-01-25T14:02:00.000Z	travisat		it wasn't only ubuntu though, my debian install cd wouldn't detect my hd
2008-01-25T14:04:00.000Z	travisat		why are you using ubuntu in the first place?
2008-01-25T14:04:00.000Z	travisat		just curious
2008-01-25T14:05:00.000Z	travisat		or just use a different distro like say debian
2008-01-25T14:06:00.000Z	travisat		go old skool
2008-01-25T14:06:00.000Z	travisat		I am only using ubuntu over debian because I am lazy and didn't want to bother with my video card, I read that 7.10 would install it easy
2008-01-25T14:06:00.000Z	salah	travisat	because I like the distro? do I need to change dist because there is a bug there?
2008-01-25T14:07:00.000Z	travisat	salah	well yes if you complain about a bug and it really makes you mad it is a good reason to switch
2008-01-25T14:08:00.000Z	salah	travisat	why don't you buy a new house or a new car because there is one single, small fail on it...? or take your own life because there is something you don't like in it? these questions are as dumb as yours
2008-01-25T14:08:00.000Z	travisat	salah	if there is a small flaw of course, but then I wouldn't be complaining about it, I would ignore it or fix it
2008-01-25T14:09:00.000Z	salah	travisat	how about that there is no easy way to fix it? and if you find a way i'll shut up
2008-01-25T14:09:00.000Z	travisat	salah	if it is a small problem then it shouldn't matter
2008-01-25T14:10:00.000Z	travisat	salah	and I don't know what your problems are
2008-01-25T14:10:00.000Z	salah	travisat	it is a small, BUT annoying problem. and everytime I ask here noone can anything about it
2008-01-25T14:14:00.000Z	travisat	salah	or http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=187874?
2008-01-25T14:20:00.000Z	travisat	salah	well you could file a bug report, I didn't see any for it matching yours, but I could of looked at the wrong package
