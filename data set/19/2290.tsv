2010-05-08T15:42:00.000Z	Xethron		Hey, I have a really old PC and I was wondering if it would be a good idea to install Ubuntu onto it. I am currently running the live CD but its really slow. I dont know where to check for specs, but its roughly a AMD Duron 900MHz with just above 300mb ram, and 10 GB HDD space
2010-05-08T15:43:00.000Z	igoryon	Xethron	LiveCD is slow by itself, not because of a slow computer, but because of slow read from CD/DVD
2010-05-08T15:44:00.000Z	Xethron		I can install Ubuntu and install the xfe pacages later to make it Xubuntu right?
2010-05-08T15:44:00.000Z	Xethron		Because I dont really have the internet to download abother CD... hehe
2010-05-08T15:44:00.000Z	igoryon	Xethron	if you don't use compiz, etc., the computer should run ok
2010-05-08T15:46:00.000Z	igoryon	Xethron	unless you have a good 3D accellerator
2010-05-08T15:46:00.000Z	igoryon	Xethron	yes
2010-05-08T15:47:00.000Z	igoryon		hello, when I do: wget -c --header="Content-length: 4700000\n" http://membres.multimania.fr/adrislayer/terrelune.png
2010-05-08T15:47:00.000Z	igoryon		(I tried \n\n also) It says: ERROR 413: Request Entity Too Large.
2010-05-08T15:48:00.000Z	igoryon		When I do: wget -c --header="Content-length: 4700000" http://membres.multimania.fr/adrislayer/terrelune.png
2010-05-08T15:48:00.000Z	igoryon		It says: 400 Bad Request
2010-05-08T15:48:00.000Z	igoryon		The reason, I have to add this header is because, the server with this image doesn't provide Content-Length header, and download always breaks at different places in the middle, showing 100% downloaded, but I know that the download is incomplete, but the actual image on the server is complete.
2010-05-08T15:48:00.000Z	igoryon		What am I doing wrong?
2010-05-08T15:48:00.000Z	Xethron	igoryon	I dont really want compiz or anything to work. Just want a PC where they can use Internet, (Facebook and Gmail), work on documents and spreadsheets... Nothing fancy
2010-05-08T15:51:00.000Z	igoryon	Xethron	should work fairly well, I have a 700Mhz Celleron with Kubuntu, and it runs fine.
2010-05-08T15:51:00.000Z	Xethron	igoryon	How much ram do you have on that PC?
2010-05-08T15:52:00.000Z	igoryon	Xethron	but I have 768Mb of Ram on that comp
2010-05-08T15:53:00.000Z	igoryon		how do I specify a Content-Length header in wget?
2010-05-08T15:55:00.000Z	igoryon	Xethron	768
