2008-12-21T13:52:00.000Z	mk123		anyone here using 'wicd' wireless manager?
2008-12-21T13:53:00.000Z	rww	mk123	did you let it sit for a while? wicd tends to freeze up when it's busy doing stuff
2008-12-21T13:53:00.000Z	mk123	rww	the whole system freezes permanently
2008-12-21T13:54:00.000Z	rww	mk123	ah. different issue, then :(
2008-12-21T13:54:00.000Z	mk123	rww	can you guide me to connect  to a wep network from shell?
2008-12-21T13:55:00.000Z	rww	mk123	let me see if i can find the guide i used a while ago
2008-12-21T13:55:00.000Z	mk123	rww	thanks :]

2008-12-21T13:56:00.000Z	rww	mk123	(that's an answer to its brokenness, not a guide)
2008-12-21T13:59:00.000Z	rww	mk123	okay. For WEP, take a look at http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=12045
2008-12-21T13:59:00.000Z	rww	mk123	basically, you edit /etc/network/interfaces and add a couple of lines for your wireless interface, then do sudo ifup interface_name_goes_here
2008-12-21T14:00:00.000Z	mk123	rww	tried that
2008-12-21T14:00:00.000Z	rww	mk123	and it's not working? do you get error output, or is it just hanging too?
2008-12-21T14:00:00.000Z	mk123	rww	its dhcp anyway why do i have to give it essid?
2008-12-21T14:00:00.000Z	rww	mk123	essid is the broadcast name of the network, not a hostname
2008-12-21T14:00:00.000Z	mk123	rww	commands pass but for some reason i can't connect - scan works though
2008-12-21T14:01:00.000Z	mk123	rww	i have the ath5k kernel driver - maybe im missing some encryption dependancies in the kernel?
2008-12-21T14:02:00.000Z	rww	mk123	I'm not using an atheros card, so I don't know the specifics, but I don't think you need extra stuff for WEP, just for WPA/WPA2. I didn't need to manually-configure my WEP when I had it, though (networkmanager handled it), so I could be wrong.
2008-12-21T14:06:00.000Z	mk123	rww	im going to get madwifi, screw ath6k
