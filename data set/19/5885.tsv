2008-07-10T01:07:00.000Z	yo		Is there a good software app that can covert to ipod video format on ubuntu?
2008-07-10T01:07:00.000Z	billgoldberg	yo	that would be winff
2008-07-10T01:08:00.000Z	billgoldberg	yo	but you'll first have to install ffmpeg from the repo
2008-07-10T01:08:00.000Z	yo	billgoldberg	ah, thanks!
2008-07-10T01:17:00.000Z	yo	billgoldberg	I get the message 'unknown codec' in the terminal when I go to covert.  Any ideas?
2008-07-10T01:19:00.000Z	billgoldberg	yo	can you say that again, what's the problem?
2008-07-10T01:20:00.000Z	yo	billgoldberg	the files can't covert because it says 'unknown codec'
2008-07-10T01:22:00.000Z	billgoldberg	yo	did you get that?
2008-07-10T01:23:00.000Z	yo	billgoldberg	medibuntu, I'm looking at my update manager... doesn't seem listed
2008-07-10T01:24:00.000Z	yo	billgoldberg	sorry for the noob question, but how would I do that?
2008-07-10T01:25:00.000Z	billgoldberg	yo	ok, first go to synaptic package manager (system -> administration ) and search for winff. Right-click it an choose: completly remove. Do the same for "ffmpeg". Then install the medibuntu repo (the first point in this guide: http://linuxowns.wordpress.com/2008/06/23/install-audio-and-video-codecs-in-ubuntu/). Then install ffmpeg again, idem dito for winff
2008-07-10T01:27:00.000Z	yo	billgoldberg	very good .  thank you very much!
2008-07-10T01:36:00.000Z	yo	billgoldberg	 should I also completely remove anything related or sharing the ffmpeg codec?
2008-07-10T01:52:00.000Z	yo	billgoldberg	uh oh.  I get an error, "ffmpeg:   Depends: libc6 (>=2.7-1) but 2.6.1-1ubuntu10 is to be installed" when I try to re-install ffmpeg.
2008-07-10T01:56:00.000Z	yo	billgoldberg	any ideas on why it broke?
2008-07-10T02:38:00.000Z	billgoldberg	yo	what's the problem?
2008-07-10T02:39:00.000Z	yo	billgoldberg	after I installed the medibuntu repositories, I can't install ffmpeg
2008-07-10T02:45:00.000Z	billgoldberg	yo	what's the problem
2008-07-10T02:45:00.000Z	yo	billgoldberg	the link you gave me was for hardy, not gutsy
