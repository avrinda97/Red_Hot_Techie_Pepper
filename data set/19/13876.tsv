2005-10-11T08:55:00.000Z	DonL	Xenguy	I'm always open to different stuff. But I seem to migrate back to Gnome all the time lately
2005-10-11T08:55:00.000Z	Xenguy	DonL	gnome is great, except for older hardware, where it starts to chug
2005-10-11T08:56:00.000Z	DonL	Xenguy	good thing I gutted my system and put fast stuff in it a year ago. It' now almost up to the speed of machines you can buy for 500 bucks just about anywhere. LOL
2005-10-11T08:57:00.000Z	Xenguy	DonL	yep
2005-10-25T08:28:00.000Z	Xenguy	DonL	Is there a reason you don't want Breezy?
2005-10-25T08:29:00.000Z	DonL	Xenguy	I screwed up my system completely in trying to upgrade to Breezy
2005-10-25T08:30:00.000Z	Xenguy	DonL	wow, really -- I hit a few speedbumps, but all ended well (Breezy is stable now of course)
2005-10-25T08:30:00.000Z	DonL	Xenguy	good for you. I had a bunch of stuff non official, and maybe that was my problem
2005-10-25T08:31:00.000Z	Xenguy	DonL	Just wanted you to be aware (if you weren't already) that Breezy is now stable :-)
2005-10-25T08:36:00.000Z	DonL	Xenguy	there's another weekend coming up. Hopefully I can try another update. Last time I managed a partial one, and I was able to experience Gnome 2.12 for a bit. I really liked it.
2005-10-25T08:37:00.000Z	Xenguy	DonL	Breezy appears to be an improvement overall over Hoary
2005-10-25T08:39:00.000Z	Xenguy	DonL	change /etc/apt/sources.list (hoary -> breezy), then 'apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade'
2005-10-25T08:39:00.000Z	Xenguy	DonL	you may have to repeat the command a few times until everything settles down, but otherwise it worked nicely for me :-)
2005-10-25T08:40:00.000Z	DonL	Xenguy	so just change everything that says Hoary to Breezy?
2005-10-25T08:40:00.000Z	DonL	Xenguy	I understand the repeated commands. Been through that
2005-10-25T08:40:00.000Z	Xenguy	DonL	yes, simply substitute string 'breezy' for 'hoary'
2005-10-25T08:41:00.000Z	DonL	Xenguy	Cool. That's what I did before, but maybe if I try it again
2005-10-25T08:42:00.000Z	Xenguy	DonL	make sure your data is backed-up if you can :-)
2005-10-25T08:42:00.000Z	DonL	Xenguy	the only real stuff I need is my address book and I've done that. All bookmarks can be figured out later
