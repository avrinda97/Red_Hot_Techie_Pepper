2012-01-28T13:58:00.000Z	meganerd	jdhfr	the CLI for languge is locale
2012-01-28T13:58:00.000Z	jdhfr	meganerd	it doesn't make any sense
2012-01-28T14:00:00.000Z	meganerd	jdhfr	are you trying to change the language you see at the console?
2012-01-28T14:01:00.000Z	meganerd	jdhfr	I use the 4 commands listed at http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/819756/
2012-01-28T14:04:00.000Z	meganerd	jdhfr	what is the output from "locale"
2012-01-28T14:39:00.000Z	meganerd	jdhfr	http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/819756/
2012-01-28T14:40:00.000Z	jdhfr	meganerd	and how is that related to keyboard?
2012-01-28T14:42:00.000Z	meganerd	jdhfr	do you have the problem when you switch to the console with ctrl-alt-F1?
2012-01-28T14:44:00.000Z	meganerd	jdhfr	then your problem sounds like the locale got messed up, you can go to ctrl-alt-f2 if need be
2012-01-28T14:44:00.000Z	meganerd	jdhfr	what happens when you locale all by itself?
2012-01-28T14:44:00.000Z	jdhfr	meganerd	forget about locale, i'm talking about keyboard
2012-01-28T14:45:00.000Z	meganerd	jdhfr	locale controls the keyboard at the console, as in when you are not using X
2012-01-28T14:46:00.000Z	jdhfr	meganerd	it doesn't. now stop trolling
2012-01-28T14:47:00.000Z	meganerd	jdhfr	anyway, I need sleep, best of luck to you.
2012-01-28T14:51:00.000Z	meganerd	jdhfr	untruths?  nice and classy, it is what I love about the Internet.
2012-01-28T14:51:00.000Z	meganerd	jdhfr	did you try "sudo dpkg-reconfigure console-setup" by any chance?
2012-01-28T14:53:00.000Z	jdhfr	meganerd	it propmted me to select font but nothing about keyboard
