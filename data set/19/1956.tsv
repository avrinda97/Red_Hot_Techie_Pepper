2010-08-27T22:59:00.000Z	seekwill	axisys	Ok then!
2010-08-27T22:52:00.000Z	seekwill	axisys	Why vbox?
2010-08-27T22:52:00.000Z	seekwill	axisys	Just stick the DVD in, and click install :P
2010-08-27T22:53:00.000Z	axisys	seekwill	i want to install multiple VMs .. vbox seems pretty easy
2010-08-27T22:53:00.000Z	axisys	seekwill	should i rather go with kvm ?
2010-08-27T22:54:00.000Z	seekwill	axisys	KVM works a bit more efficient, if your CPU supports virtualization
2010-08-27T22:54:00.000Z	axisys	seekwill	it does support virtualization
2010-08-27T22:54:00.000Z	axisys	seekwill	but i want to run in laptop with graphics
2010-08-27T22:56:00.000Z	seekwill	axisys	Ok, just do it :)
2010-08-27T22:57:00.000Z	axisys	seekwill	so kvm.. no one mentioned xen.. i guess not preferred ;-)
2010-08-27T22:57:00.000Z	seekwill	axisys	It all depends on what you need.
2010-08-27T22:58:00.000Z	seekwill	axisys	Why not use Fedora? RHEL? Arch Linux? All preferences...
2010-08-27T22:58:00.000Z	seekwill	axisys	They each have their pros and cons. You have to decide what fits best for you. I use vbox and love it. But I only used it because my CPU does't support virt
2010-08-27T22:59:00.000Z	axisys	seekwill	my cpu supports virt.. but kvm seems best fit for server setup.. while vbox is for gui..
2010-08-27T23:00:00.000Z	axisys	seekwill	is it possible to install desktop + lvm + kvm ? or kvm only works with server ?
2010-08-27T23:01:00.000Z	seekwill	axisys	That one I don't know
2010-08-27T23:01:00.000Z	seekwill	axisys	Yes, technically possible, but I don't know how ubuntu does it
2010-08-27T23:03:00.000Z	seekwill	axisys	You're thinking too much. Just install it.
2010-08-27T23:03:00.000Z	axisys	seekwill	hehe..
