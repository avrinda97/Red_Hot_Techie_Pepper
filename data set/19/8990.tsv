2007-01-09T16:31:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple		OK, from the simple question about 50 euros, there's a war breaking out over monitor standards :O
2007-01-09T16:32:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple		So, lets change the subject... what applications would you recommend from the Ubuntu Edgy Add/Remove applications for someone of a developer/hacker/networking turn of mind?
2007-01-09T16:33:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple		oh don't start on me!
2007-01-09T16:33:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple		I'm asking for points of view - there's a multitude of different apps for the same thing!
2007-01-09T16:34:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple		achieve? Well I'm a programmer/hacker/developer moving totally over from Windows so I'm used to having all sorts of tools around 'just in case' for hacking badly behaved apps, networks, etc.
2007-01-09T16:35:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple		I use Eclipse for development, Wireshark for net hacking, etc
2007-01-09T16:36:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple		I've got eclipse, thats not a problem. I was looking through the list of apps in Edgy's Add/Remove and wondering what else to add
2007-01-09T16:36:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple		there's a lot of KDE stuff in there, which I presumably can't use in Gnome?
2007-01-09T16:37:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple		oooo can I? oooooooooooo!!!
2007-01-09T16:38:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple		I'm just interested and what other people find to be useful tools
2007-01-09T16:38:00.000Z	Enlight_uni	IntuitiveNipple	emacs FTW
2007-01-09T16:41:00.000Z	Enlight_uni	IntuitiveNipple	strace is a great tool also for debugging purpose
2007-01-09T16:41:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Enlight_uni	thanks - I'll google that now to find about it
2007-01-09T16:42:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Enlight_uni	YES, thats the kind of thing I like to have about me!
2007-01-09T16:42:00.000Z	Enlight_uni	IntuitiveNipple	^^
2007-01-09T16:43:00.000Z	Enlight_uni	IntuitiveNipple	that's the bigger troll in the community, I prefer emacs
2007-01-09T16:43:00.000Z	Enlight_uni	IntuitiveNipple	lots of people only swear by the name of vim also
2007-01-09T16:47:00.000Z	Enlight_uni	IntuitiveNipple	writing in hexadecimal???? Why the hell would one do that?
2007-01-09T16:47:00.000Z	Enlight_uni	IntuitiveNipple	okay!
