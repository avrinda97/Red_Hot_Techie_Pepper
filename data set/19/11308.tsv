2006-06-04T09:30:00.000Z	synth		i spend more time in windows than linux, but i blame my WOW addiction
2006-06-04T09:32:00.000Z	synth		oh, no, that was Timo
2006-06-04T09:34:00.000Z	synth		im having a problem when i boot off the disk it gets an error reading a specific sector
2006-06-04T09:34:00.000Z	synth		it eventually boots to the desk but then the installer crashes
2006-06-04T09:35:00.000Z	synth		I play WOW on Windows @ 1280x1024 with every setting cranked
2006-06-04T09:35:00.000Z	synth		hope i can do that under wine/cedega :)
2006-06-04T09:36:00.000Z	linxeh	synth	lets hope you arent running the 64bit version of ubuntu :)
2006-06-04T09:36:00.000Z	synth	linxeh	oh. oh. heh.
2006-06-04T09:36:00.000Z	synth	linxeh	Athlon 64 3700 :) damn..
2006-06-04T09:37:00.000Z	linxeh	synth	just use the 32bit version - you dont have more than 4GB ram do you?
2006-06-04T09:37:00.000Z	synth	linxeh	3 gigs, but thats addressable under 32 bit
2006-06-04T09:39:00.000Z	synth	linxeh	you know how chip fab works right
2006-06-04T09:39:00.000Z	synth	linxeh	if it runs stable at an overclocked speed, odds are, it can handle it :)
2006-06-04T09:39:00.000Z	linxeh	synth	yes, but your definition of stable is likely very different from mine
2006-06-04T09:39:00.000Z	synth	linxeh	they often take higher chips and relabel them lower to meet supplier demands
2006-06-04T09:39:00.000Z	synth	linxeh	Ive run PRIME95 for 24 hours consecitively, BurnInTest Pro for 12 hours
2006-06-04T09:39:00.000Z	synth	linxeh	it's stable.
2006-06-04T09:40:00.000Z	linxeh	synth	again, our definitions most likely differ
2006-06-04T09:40:00.000Z	synth	linxeh	its stable for daily usage, and for that i cant complain
