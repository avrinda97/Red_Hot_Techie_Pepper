2008-11-09T03:13:00.000Z	shredder12	Sindwiller	well i am unable to connect to internet...coz i can't find any eth0 network interface specified when i run ifconfig
2008-11-09T03:14:00.000Z	Sindwiller	shredder12	which is not a problem of the Kernel maybe but more likely your net configuration file
2008-11-09T03:15:00.000Z	shredder12	Sindwiller	Well when i was using hardy earlier and upgraded to 24-21 then i had the same problem..so since then i have been using 24-19..
2008-11-09T03:15:00.000Z	Sindwiller	shredder12	I see
2008-11-09T03:16:00.000Z	shredder12	Sindwiller	I thought it was some bug in the kernel..but whatever it is..has switched to the new kernel..when i upgraded to intrepid..
2008-11-09T03:17:00.000Z	Sindwiller	shredder12	*shrugs* that is some weird issue alright... do you mind to post in the Forums? It doesn't look like anybody in here could help you OR anybody even follows the happenings in this channel, so :P

2008-11-09T03:24:00.000Z	Sindwiller	shredder12	'sudo asoundconf set-default-card Intel'? I have no idea otherwise
2008-11-09T03:25:00.000Z	shredder12	Sindwiller	earlier everything was working fine..then i switched to 27-7 and there the sounds weren't working so i changed the settings in Preferences->Sound to some HDA oss instead of ALSA...and when i clicked Test i heard a beep so i thougt that everything was working fine..
2008-11-09T03:25:00.000Z	shredder12	Sindwiller	but when i switched back to 24-19 i didn't worked even after changing the settings back to the earlier one..
