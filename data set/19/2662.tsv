2010-03-09T02:01:00.000Z	KaOSoFt		Of course, Windows 7 offers better UAC management, but that's besides the point.
2010-03-09T02:02:00.000Z	KaOSoFt		Ctrl + Alt + F7
2010-03-09T02:02:00.000Z	KaOSoFt		Wait... was it?
2010-03-09T02:04:00.000Z	KaOSoFt		Desciero- You get used to it after a while. I was a Windows user too. :D
2010-03-09T02:05:00.000Z	KaOSoFt		Desciero- When something should require "administrator" priviledges.
2010-03-09T02:07:00.000Z	KaOSoFt		Yeah, exactly.
2010-03-09T02:09:00.000Z	KaOSoFt		I mostly use apt-get, but if for some reason I have the Synaptic window open, I use that instead.
2010-03-09T02:10:00.000Z	KaOSoFt		Yep.
2010-03-09T02:12:00.000Z	KaOSoFt		By the way, if for some reason I forget my password, is there a way to reset it, much like Windows' SAM file?
2010-03-09T02:12:00.000Z	koshari	KaOSoFt	chroot
2010-03-09T02:15:00.000Z	KaOSoFt		ASULutzy- Do you mean I simply use the recover console, and then "passwd"?
2010-03-09T02:17:00.000Z	KaOSoFt		Is recovery console available for everyone? I mean... isn't that even more dangerous that having to use an external tool for Windows in order to reset its SAM file...?
2010-03-09T02:18:00.000Z	KaOSoFt		I understand. After all, my computer is not a server, so it's not located in a remote (subterranean) data center or anything like that.
2010-03-09T02:20:00.000Z	KaOSoFt		Where can I learn more about these encrypted file-systems? I remember installing something like that for Ubuntu, which now gets the "Encryp" option by right-clicking a file or folder, but I don't even remember its name.
2010-03-09T02:20:00.000Z	KaOSoFt		"Encrypt"*
2010-03-09T02:21:00.000Z	koshari	KaOSoFt	you can restrict grub, but there is still a hole given you can boot from usb/optical media, so you would have to bios protect booting from these, but then again a bios reset would make them avaialble, moral of story, there is no such thing as total security when someone has physical acces sot machine, in windows or linux
2010-03-09T02:23:00.000Z	koshari	KaOSoFt	which is why in entiprise all password authentication and account details are kept on a server
2010-03-09T02:23:00.000Z	KaOSoFt	koshari	ASULutzy, brjann, Jordan_U: thank you all.
