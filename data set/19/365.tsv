2012-03-25T02:14:00.000Z	cuddylier		Hello
2012-03-25T02:15:00.000Z	cuddylier		I have a problem with my account "Ryan", It has no permission to access the "home" folder or install any programs via sudo command
2012-03-25T02:15:00.000Z	cuddylier		Yes, root
2012-03-25T02:16:00.000Z	cuddylier		How?
2012-03-25T02:16:00.000Z	cuddylier		I'm a total n00b at ubuntu
2012-03-25T02:17:00.000Z	jimi_c	cuddylier	id <username>
2012-03-25T02:20:00.000Z	jimi_c	cuddylier	gpasswd -a admin ryan
2012-03-25T02:21:00.000Z	jimi_c	cuddylier	you did that backwards I think
2012-03-25T02:22:00.000Z	jimi_c	cuddylier	run this "getent group admin"
2012-03-25T02:22:00.000Z	jimi_c	cuddylier	run "id" with no options, what user does it say you are?
2012-03-25T02:23:00.000Z	jimi_c	cuddylier	run "getenforce"
2012-03-25T02:25:00.000Z	jimi_c	cuddylier	it seems like your system is not in a good state :/
2012-03-25T02:26:00.000Z	jimi_c	cuddylier	you can try and do what it says, to correct packaging issues. If this is a brand new install, you might want to try reinstalling
2012-03-25T02:31:00.000Z	jimi_c	cuddylier	you'll have to delete files from the command line using the rm command - but be VERY careful what you delete
2012-03-25T02:33:00.000Z	jimi_c	cuddylier	"rm -rf ~/Desktop/folder" <- BE VERY CAREFUL WITH "rm -rf"
2012-03-25T02:36:00.000Z	jimi_c	cuddylier	you can give sudo access by using the gpasswd command we gave you above
2012-03-25T02:39:00.000Z	jimi_c	cuddylier	log out and log back in?
2012-03-25T02:43:00.000Z	jimi_c	cuddylier	can't help you there, it sounds like you're not running a standard desktop setup
2012-03-25T04:04:00.000Z	jimi_c	cuddylier	do you have anything on this server yet? probably easiest just to blow it away and reinstall from scratch
