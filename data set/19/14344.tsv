2004-09-27T10:32:00.000Z	defendguin		i installed ubuntu on an extra /dev/hdd but i didnt want it writing over my grub bootloader i already have on the MBR so i was going to edit my grub.conf could anyone post their grub.conf?
2004-09-27T10:34:00.000Z	Kamion	defendguin	don't have a convenient i386 box right now, but if it helps, the Ubuntu installer detects entries in your existing grub configuration and includes them in the one it writes out
2004-09-27T10:43:00.000Z	Kamion	defendguin	can you really use root=LABEL=/ that way?
2004-09-27T12:11:00.000Z	Kamion	defendguin	I'd like details of that in a bug report, it's supposed to
2004-09-27T12:12:00.000Z	Kamion	defendguin	grub is flexible enough that you should be able to type in the details at its prompt and have it work, so it shouldn't be a disaster
2004-09-27T12:13:00.000Z	defendguin	Kamion	well you see i have 3 hard drives on this box i tried to install this on the 3rd hard drive and when it asked for when it was to install the boot loader i told it the MBR which is on the master primary ide if i am correct
2004-09-27T12:13:00.000Z	Kamion	defendguin	what I need is (a) what the other operating systems are (b) what 'os-prober' says when you run it at the command prompt from alt-f2 in the installer
2004-09-27T12:14:00.000Z	Kamion	defendguin	like I say, though, a bugzilla report will stop me forgetting about it, and I'm the guy who needs to fix it :)
2004-09-27T12:15:00.000Z	defendguin	Kamion	id be happy to file a bugzilla report as soon as i have fixed my situation
2004-09-27T12:16:00.000Z	Kamion	defendguin	that might be it
2004-09-27T12:18:00.000Z	defendguin	Kamion	i am also a but upset that it did not detect my extra drive where i have all my music :(
2004-10-08T15:53:00.000Z	defendguin	Kamion	releasing so close to gnome 2.8 helped so much with people wanting to try gnome 2.8 ut not wanting to use one of the build tools :-)
2004-10-18T13:26:00.000Z	defendguin	Kamion	i did
2004-10-25T16:19:00.000Z	Kamion	defendguin	requires 200 learned ham and 200 learned spam before the bayesian detector kicks in, as far as I remember
2004-10-25T16:20:00.000Z	defendguin	Kamion	wow
2004-10-25T16:22:00.000Z	Kamion	defendguin	I get about that in a morning ;)
2004-11-13T11:52:00.000Z	Kamion	defendguin	unlikely; it certainly won't be part of what the core team works on
2004-11-13T11:52:00.000Z	Kamion	defendguin	hoary is only six months away, so we don't need to get into a backporting spaghetti nightmare
2004-11-13T11:53:00.000Z	Kamion	defendguin	you can wait six months :)
