2011-08-20T22:05:00.000Z	ubuntu2		the problem is I was reading and it asid to first change  to desktop but itt says no such directery
2011-08-20T22:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ubuntu2	 you may want to read up on a few shell basics tgutorials.. it would be  'cd Desktop' IF the directory name is Desktop. not 'desktop'
2011-08-20T22:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ubuntu2	 case IS imporntant
2011-08-20T22:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ubuntu2	 they proberlmy ment to your 'Desktop' which on a normal desktop install is /home/yourusername/Desktop
2011-08-20T22:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ubuntu2	 CASE is imporntant...
2011-08-20T22:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ubuntu2	 cd /home/yourusername/Desktop
2011-08-20T22:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ubuntu2	 use the 'ls' command and LOOK and see what directories are there
2011-08-20T22:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ubuntu2	 on a normal ubuntu setup its Desktop   NOT 'desktop'
2011-08-20T22:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ubuntu2	 It would really benifit you to spend an hr learning some command line basics.
2011-08-20T22:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ubuntu2	 now is it Desktop or desktop
2011-08-20T22:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ubuntu2	 err.. you cant READ and see that its Desktop or desktop?
2011-08-20T22:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ubuntu2	 so... rember. Case is impiorntant... spell things correctly
2011-09-06T02:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ubuntu2	 it would be ~/Desktop/
2011-09-06T02:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ubuntu2	 and may be best to use the full path not the ~ shortcut
