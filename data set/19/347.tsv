2012-04-02T22:07:00.000Z	tom_toc	bobo37773	I can load live CD and check
2012-04-02T22:06:00.000Z	bobo37773	tom_toc	Hmm. Is the UID correct? Can you get to a shell to check?
2012-04-02T22:07:00.000Z	tom_toc	bobo37773	it was all working before..
2012-04-02T22:07:00.000Z	bobo37773	tom_toc	Do you know how to chroot
2012-04-02T22:08:00.000Z	tom_toc	bobo37773	I have done it before but it's been a long time
2012-04-02T22:13:00.000Z	bobo37773	tom_toc	Maybe the UID got messed up during recovery. Hard to say. Doesn't sound like an hdd issue to me though
2012-04-02T22:16:00.000Z	bobo37773	tom_toc	I don't know a whole lot about grub2 but you may be able to change the UID with the partition like sda3 sda4 whatever.
2012-04-02T22:19:00.000Z	tom_toc	bobo37773	Yeah, that may be a good approach.  Thanks for the tips and suggestions..  Need to run to a meeting so I'll have to come back to this mess..Cheers!
2012-04-02T22:19:00.000Z	bobo37773	tom_toc	Okay. Take care
2012-04-02T22:20:00.000Z	tom_toc	bobo37773	is it possible to 'reinstall' ubuntu - over the current one... but keep my files?
2012-04-02T22:21:00.000Z	bobo37773	tom_toc	Many things are possible. If you're asking me if I recommend it: No I don't.
2012-04-02T22:21:00.000Z	tom_toc	bobo37773	I'm thinking., update all the OS stuff and leave everything else alone..
2012-04-02T22:21:00.000Z	tom_toc	bobo37773	(that would be after I backup what I know I need...  It's just what I don't know i need..)
2012-04-02T22:22:00.000Z	bobo37773	tom_toc	Back up and just do a clean install.
2012-04-02T22:22:00.000Z	tom_toc	bobo37773	that sounds like a good path.. Is there a reccomended backup approach, or just grab /home?
2012-04-02T22:23:00.000Z	bobo37773	tom_toc	Use rsync to back up the whole thing if that's what you want. I usually back up /etc as I make a lot of changes there too. Also, you may want to create a list of all installed applications so you can install them back all at once.
2012-04-02T22:24:00.000Z	tom_toc	bobo37773	yep, sounds like a good plan.   would rsych work to a local usb drive?
2012-04-02T22:25:00.000Z	bobo37773	tom_toc	As long as there is enough space. It's like cp. You tell it where to put the files. Pretty sure it is one of the switches.
2012-04-02T22:29:00.000Z	tom_toc	bobo37773	thanks!
