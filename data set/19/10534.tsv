2006-07-10T10:18:00.000Z	Geoffrey2		when you're installing an application, which directory do you typically want to install it under?
2006-07-10T10:18:00.000Z	Warbo	Geoffrey2	In Syanptic it will go in /usr. Manually use checkinstall to put it in /usr/local
2006-07-10T10:19:00.000Z	Geoffrey2	Warbo	um, what is checkinstall?
2006-07-10T10:23:00.000Z	Geoffrey2	Warbo	the application is a .bin file that self installs...I'm assuming I wouldn't need checkinstall for that then?
2006-07-10T10:24:00.000Z	Warbo	Geoffrey2	Those are the worst. Maybe you could trap it in a fakeroot and build a package out of it that way?
2006-07-31T12:18:00.000Z	Warbo	Geoffrey2	VMWare is faster
2006-07-31T12:18:00.000Z	Warbo	Geoffrey2	Qemu can do multiple processors (PowerPC, etc.) but if you want to virtualise, rather than emulate, you will need KQemu which is on qemu.org
2006-07-31T12:20:00.000Z	Geoffrey2	Warbo	I'll probably want to spend some time examining qemu's website, since I really don't know what the difference is between "virtualising" and "emulating"
2006-07-31T12:23:00.000Z	Warbo	Geoffrey2	Emulating is creating a computer out of software. It means you can run any computer (Mac, Amiga, Sega, Playststion, etc.) inside another, but it goes slow. Virtualising makes an emulator of the computer you are running (probably a PC), but instead of emulating everything, there is no point since you already have a PC, so it sends the processing and stuff directly to your real hardware (but in a non-conflicting way).
2006-07-31T12:25:00.000Z	Geoffrey2	Warbo	are there any downsides to Virtualizing?
2006-07-31T12:26:00.000Z	Warbo	Geoffrey2	It is slower than running a real computer, but the best virtualisers (like VMWare) is almost full speed (when you take into account that you are running 2 operating systems at the same time)
2006-07-31T12:27:00.000Z	Warbo	Geoffrey2	Virtual computers are more secure than real ones as well, since if Windows gets full of viruses in a virtual machine you can just close it and carry on running Ubuntu
2006-07-31T12:29:00.000Z	Geoffrey2	Warbo	so if I wanted to run both Windows and Ubuntu, I'd be better off running Windows inside a VM in Ubuntu?
2006-07-31T12:29:00.000Z	Warbo	Geoffrey2	I would say so
2006-07-31T12:30:00.000Z	Warbo	Geoffrey2	Ubuntu is seen as more stable than Windows, so Windows is more likely to crash. If it crashes in a VM you will need to restart it. If it crashes with Ubuntu in a VM, it will take down Ubuntu too
2006-07-31T12:49:00.000Z	Warbo	Geoffrey2	If your computer is 2.5GHz or more I would say VMWare would be fine. Anything below that would be awful for virtualised media players
2006-07-31T13:06:00.000Z	Warbo	Geoffrey2	Put some Windows codecs in /usr/lib/codecs
2006-10-01T12:38:00.000Z	Geoffrey2	Warbo	I just need port 8001 because my router is vulnerable to that exploit, and Netgear apparently doesn't see the need to provide a fix for it
2006-10-01T12:38:00.000Z	Warbo	Geoffrey2	Yeah, but it seems to be useful for other reasons as well (like mine) :)
