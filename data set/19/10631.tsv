2006-06-06T07:33:00.000Z	UserName14		I have setup subversion, the repoistory works fine. How do i make it work with /var/www for my webroot\server ??? I wouldnt ask but i have wasted sooo much time on subversion please put me out of my misery
2006-06-06T07:35:00.000Z	babo	UserName14	what do you mean ... get it to work with /var/www ?
2006-06-06T07:36:00.000Z	UserName14	babo	I can commit but I want it so it has an up to date version that is ALWAYS up to date in /var/www so that i can view what i am working on
2006-06-06T07:37:00.000Z	babo	UserName14	I'm not a subversion expert by any means, but I didn't know that it goes beyond the standard checkin, checkout model ...
2006-06-06T07:38:00.000Z	UserName14	babo	if it isnt then that makes it totaly useless for webdevelopment
2006-06-06T07:38:00.000Z	UserName14	babo	it is possible to login via http:// (as long as i use the password) that version is ALWAYS up to date
2006-06-06T07:38:00.000Z	babo	UserName14	when you are finished with something, then just check it in ... ?
2006-06-06T07:39:00.000Z	UserName14	babo	you dont understand my problem i dont think, do you do webdev?
2006-06-06T07:39:00.000Z	babo	UserName14	yes, but I've only just started to use subversion a couple of days ago ...
2006-06-06T07:39:00.000Z	UserName14	babo	I am not interested in what i could do, i am sure there is a "proper way " and thats why i am asking for help
2006-06-06T07:40:00.000Z	UserName14	babo	are you using cvs with your www root, how are you doing it?
2006-06-06T07:40:00.000Z	babo	UserName14	hmm ... maybe #svn then ?
2006-06-06T07:40:00.000Z	UserName14	babo	yeah i just found svn, i was typing a message as you replied
2006-06-06T07:40:00.000Z	UserName14	babo	how did you setup svn with your webroot
2006-06-06T07:41:00.000Z	babo	UserName14	ok, I'm interested to hear  how to set it up properly though ...
2006-06-06T07:41:00.000Z	babo	UserName14	I mainly just use it for webscripts at the moment, I haven't had a chance to configure it for /var/www yet though, so I hope you don't mind if i easedrop in #svn ... :-)
2006-06-06T07:43:00.000Z	babo	UserName14	I guess what I was planning on doing was setting up a repo in /var/www/ ... then co to start working on something, and ci to finish working on it ...
2006-06-06T07:46:00.000Z	UserName14	babo	http://subversion.tigris.org/faq.html#website-auto-update (i have not tested it yet, but that is the proper way) :)
2006-06-06T07:47:00.000Z	babo	UserName14	ok thanks ...
