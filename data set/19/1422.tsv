2011-05-17T21:44:00.000Z	A_J		hey all I have an Issue. When I leave my comp on for extended periods. Mostly when i move the mouse or press a few keys the login window comes up, asking for password. Sometimes Though it does not just showing a black screen with the mouse pointer. Any Idea What Can Be Doing This ?
2011-05-17T21:45:00.000Z	rhin0	A_J	 in preferences power settings you can set power settings/screen saver settings
2011-05-17T21:46:00.000Z	rhin0		says how long your monitor will be left on whether it locks, asks for password
2011-05-17T21:46:00.000Z	A_J	rhin0	i want it to lock, but sometimes on resume the login window doesnt come forcing me to do a manual reboot
2011-05-17T21:46:00.000Z	rhin0		system/preferences/screensaver in that you also have power management -- it determines what your monitor does after a while
2011-05-17T21:47:00.000Z	rhin0	A_J	what you are saying is a power saving issue -- screen delay lockout -- disable your screen saver
2011-05-17T21:47:00.000Z	rhin0		at least
2011-05-17T21:49:00.000Z	A_J	rhin0	?
2011-05-17T21:49:00.000Z	A_J	rhin0	 disabling should fix it ?
2011-05-17T21:50:00.000Z	A_J	rhin0	is there any other way ?
2011-05-17T21:50:00.000Z	A_J	rhin0	i think it's the display Sleep Function
2011-05-17T21:52:00.000Z	rhin0		a_j your screen asking for password you need to go to system preferences screensaver - disable screensaver then click on 'power management' and look at sleep settings / your monitor computer will go to sleep after a certain time
2011-05-17T21:53:00.000Z	A_J	rhin0	i know this, so your telling me disabling Screensaver will stop  "perhaps a screensaver crashes the x server"
2011-05-17T21:54:00.000Z	rhin0		sounds like something different a_j i am only trying to help in amateur in terms of gui desktop fashion i think you just lost me
2011-05-17T21:54:00.000Z	A_J	rhin0	 screensaver disabled for now, lemme ask someone else too.. Thank You for your help
2011-05-17T21:55:00.000Z	rhin0		a_j standard ubuntu works fine with most setups -- if you are encountering problems you are running different hardware or trying to do something too extreme
2011-05-17T21:56:00.000Z	A_J	rhin0	all standard stuff, and umm doing nothing extreme
2011-05-17T21:57:00.000Z	rhin0		a_j then its just a user fault then
2011-05-17T21:57:00.000Z	A_J	rhin0	i find it painful to reboot, cause if I'm downloading something i loose progress.. thats why was asking
