2005-05-21T06:01:00.000Z	drummer		hey.. i've got a problem..... gimp keeps crashing on me when i try to copy
2005-05-21T06:01:00.000Z	drummer		is there a log anywhere i can look at.. or anyone have other ideas
2005-05-21T06:02:00.000Z	goofrider	drummer	`sudo grep -R gimp /var/log/*"
2005-05-23T09:46:00.000Z	goofrider	drummer	where di d u get the module soruces?
2005-05-23T09:47:00.000Z	goofrider	drummer	no, the module sources
2005-05-23T09:48:00.000Z	goofrider	drummer	why exactly r u compile module/kernel?
2005-05-23T09:48:00.000Z	drummer	goofrider	to include modules for lirc to work
2005-05-23T09:48:00.000Z	goofrider	drummer	and did u get the lirc module sources from apt-get?
2005-05-23T09:51:00.000Z	goofrider	drummer	there **is*** a lirc-source package
2005-05-23T09:51:00.000Z	goofrider	drummer	lirc-modules-source
2005-05-23T09:52:00.000Z	goofrider	drummer	is there any reason u are compiling from pristine upstream source?
2005-05-23T09:52:00.000Z	goofrider	drummer	if not. please apt-get install lirc-modules-source module-assistant
2005-05-23T09:52:00.000Z	drummer	goofrider	you've lost me.. i'm a n00b with modules and source n stuff
2005-05-23T09:53:00.000Z	goofrider	drummer	well, your should compile modules from sources provided by Ubuntu whenever possible
2005-05-23T09:55:00.000Z	drummer	goofrider	how do i then compile the lirc modules?
2005-05-23T09:55:00.000Z	goofrider	drummer	when it's done, do `sudo m-a a-i lirc-modules`, that should download all required headers, compile the module and install it for u
2005-05-23T09:57:00.000Z	drummer	goofrider	i started running make modules after following a post on the forums.. should i leave that run (whatever it's doing) then do 'sudo m-a a-i lirc-modules'? or can i interrupt it?
2005-05-23T09:58:00.000Z	goofrider	drummer	and if u untared the lirc module src in /usr/src, delete/move them for now. apt might overwrite it
2005-05-23T09:59:00.000Z	goofrider	drummer	Ctrl-C
