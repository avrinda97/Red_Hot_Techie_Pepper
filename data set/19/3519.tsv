2009-12-30T02:05:00.000Z	paulus68	guntbert	I am not kidding I give support at a helpdesk and if there is any frozen system we sugest to cut the power ;-) always works like a charm
2009-12-30T02:06:00.000Z	paulus68	guntbert	**guilty
2009-12-31T02:33:00.000Z	guntbert	paulus68	from cli you have to change every line in /etc/apt/sources.list
2010-01-22T02:21:00.000Z	guntbert	paulus68	what are you trying to do?
2010-01-22T02:29:00.000Z	paulus68	guntbert	I have this file where I copy the info that I get from "last" into each hour I run this script to see if a certain person has logged on and for how long but I want to clear the old date before the new one enters
2010-01-22T02:31:00.000Z	guntbert	paulus68	not sure if I understand you - the command last | grep someone > myfile      will always overwrite the file (ie truncate it before writing)
2010-02-22T01:47:00.000Z	guntbert	paulus68	how is taht an ubuntu support question?
2010-02-22T01:50:00.000Z	paulus68	guntbert	It's a kind of support question  since I use ssh to set it up and I don't want to leave any trace of it thats why
2010-02-22T01:50:00.000Z	guntbert	paulus68	no - not ubuntu support - its a networking question
2010-02-22T01:51:00.000Z	paulus68	guntbert	ok is there a networking support here?
2010-02-22T01:52:00.000Z	guntbert	paulus68	try  ##networking or ##security
2010-02-22T01:52:00.000Z	paulus68	guntbert	thanks
2012-07-17T22:56:00.000Z	paulus68	guntbert	to my humble opinion this is not ot since I use squid and want to know how to get my proxy set to the highest level of anony?
2012-07-17T22:57:00.000Z	guntbert	paulus68	to be honest I don't understand what you want but it is not ubuntu support to help you configure squid
2012-07-17T22:59:00.000Z	paulus68	guntbert	what I want to know is how do I secure/configure my squid in order to be complete anonymous example that you are not able to detect my ISP or what browser I use and what type of OS I am running
2012-07-17T23:00:00.000Z	paulus68	guntbert	if there is a squid channel available I would be happy to ask my question there
2012-07-17T23:00:00.000Z	guntbert	paulus68	configuring squid is (in my opinion) not on topic in this channel
2012-07-17T23:02:00.000Z	guntbert	paulus68	try #squid :-)   and
