2010-08-26T12:52:00.000Z	mxe5		Is there a way to check and see if someone else is using a Nickname that you in mind you would like to register ? ?
2010-08-26T12:54:00.000Z	rww	mxe5	/msg nickserv info usernamehere, see also http://freenode.net/faq.shtml#userexpirations
2010-08-26T12:55:00.000Z	mxe5	rww	Thanks
2010-08-26T12:57:00.000Z	mxe5	rww	So you could run - /msg nickserv info (Nickname I want use ) and this would give results if it's taken correct ?
2010-08-26T12:58:00.000Z	rww	mxe5	correct. It says it's not registered if it isn't.
2010-08-26T12:59:00.000Z	mxe5	rww	Ypu just did it with this Nick that I regetered and am using.
2010-08-26T13:00:00.000Z	mxe5	rww	Is it ok to have more than one NIckname registered ?
2010-08-26T13:01:00.000Z	rww	mxe5	see "/msg nickserv help group" for the preferred way of doing that.
2010-08-26T13:01:00.000Z	mxe5	rww	Thanks will do and also look at other post earlier
2010-09-06T09:25:00.000Z	rww	mxe5	You're not identified with nickserv.
2010-09-06T09:25:00.000Z	rww	mxe5	/msg nickserv identify usernamehere passwordhere
2010-09-06T09:28:00.000Z	mxe5	rww	So type in your second command in the top feenode area ?
2010-09-06T09:29:00.000Z	rww	mxe5	yes. It should open up a private message window with Nickserv and send that text top it.
2010-09-06T09:31:00.000Z	mxe5	rww	I did it - and got back - This nickname is registered. Please choose a different nickname, or identify via /msg NickServ identify <password>.
2010-09-06T09:33:00.000Z	rww	mxe5	heh. Try asking #freenode about it.
2010-09-06T09:35:00.000Z	mxe5	rww	So I just went back there and typed in my password and it recognized me - so does that mean the Nick I'm using is registered and valid but for some reason need to check with #freenode ?
2010-09-06T09:35:00.000Z	rww	mxe5	Looks like you're identified now, so whatever you did worked.
2010-09-06T09:36:00.000Z	mxe5	rww	Ok - who knows - that's part of using computers in general - Garbage In - Garbage Out! sometimes - :o)
2010-09-06T09:36:00.000Z	mxe5	rww	Thanks
