2007-07-18T13:32:00.000Z	bulmer	bullgard4	it meant you run debug on the command line..results will be displayed on the command line..so run script before hand to capture  all or redirect it to a file
2007-11-01T08:30:00.000Z	bullgard4	bulmer	Thank you.
2007-11-01T20:46:00.000Z	bullgard4	bulmer	The DEB program package 'powernowd' is installed. Where is the powernowd daemon?
2007-11-01T20:48:00.000Z	bullgard4	bulmer	locate does not look for processes but for filenames only.
2007-11-01T20:49:00.000Z	bullgard4	bulmer	No I did ask why I cannot find the powernowd process (although the powerdnowd DEB program package is installed).
2007-11-01T20:50:00.000Z	bullgard4	bulmer	There is a legitimate alternative to ps. I used this alternative.
2007-11-01T20:58:00.000Z	bullgard4	bulmer	You suggested a 3rd command. All three obtain the same result. Is it difficult for you to understand that there is no process 'powernowd'? Can you answer the question which I put at the outset or can you not?
2007-11-01T21:00:00.000Z	bullgard4	bulmer	I am looking for an answer on the question which I put at the outset.
2007-11-01T21:03:00.000Z	bullgard4	bulmer	My impression is that we turn in circles. --  Thank you.
2007-11-03T20:43:00.000Z	bullgard4	bulmer	 ~/.recently-used does not exist.
2007-11-03T20:44:00.000Z	bullgard4	bulmer	yes, there are 10 files shown.
2007-11-03T20:45:00.000Z	bullgard4	bulmer	Yes, I am the only user. So, it is the same user.
2007-11-03T20:46:00.000Z	bullgard4	bulmer	Do you use Gutsy?
2007-11-03T20:46:00.000Z	bullgard4	bulmer	Yes, this is what you said.
2007-11-03T20:47:00.000Z	bullgard4	bulmer	Ok. I will do a bit of sniffing, using the information which you gave me.
2007-11-03T21:45:00.000Z	bullgard4	bulmer	"What directory stores the 10 filenames which are displayed in Gnome main menu  Places > Recent Documents?"
2007-11-03T22:17:00.000Z	bullgard4	bulmer	I renamed ~/.recently-used. I did Ctrl+Alt+Backspace. I logged in again. Now there is a file ~/.recently-used again. But its size is only 340 Bytes. It includes only one URI line. But Gnome main menu Places > Recent Documents still contains 10 filenames. I can click on any of them, and this file will be opened.
