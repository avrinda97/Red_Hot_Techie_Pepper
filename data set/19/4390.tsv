2009-01-23T11:54:00.000Z	jef_buntu		do you know where I could find the geekest one that could help me setting up a way to boot a pentium II (that has only a network card and a keyboard [no screen]) if my other machine is a laptop...I have a hub also
2009-01-23T11:55:00.000Z	jim_p	jef_buntu	can it boot from network?

2009-01-23T11:56:00.000Z	jef_buntu	jim_p	i mean it should be, but i dont have a server settup yet
2009-01-23T11:56:00.000Z	jim_p	jef_buntu	how will you boot that pc then?
2009-01-23T11:57:00.000Z	jef_buntu	jim_p	i could set up a server on my laptop i guess
2009-01-23T11:58:00.000Z	jim_p	jef_buntu	will you give me a sec to find how an install over network is done?
