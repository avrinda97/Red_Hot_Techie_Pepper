2007-03-03T10:31:00.000Z	exs		How is feisty shaping u? anyone using it?
2007-03-03T10:31:00.000Z	eck	exs	it's pretty much like edgy, but with newer packages and a lot more bugs
2007-03-05T06:11:00.000Z	eck	exs	google 'mencoder'
2007-03-05T06:11:00.000Z	exs	eck	 and after i've got mencoder, what do I do?
2007-03-05T06:12:00.000Z	eck	exs	it is a video encoder using the same backend as mplayer, but to use it is kind of complicated; search for a howto online (or in the forums)
2007-03-05T06:13:00.000Z	eck	exs	you might try this one http://gentoo-wiki.com/HOWTO_Mencoder_Introduction_Guide
2007-03-05T06:13:00.000Z	exs	eck	 thanks
2007-03-05T06:17:00.000Z	eck	exs	there are some frontends listed at the end of the article
2007-04-21T16:05:00.000Z	eck	exs	i think a lot of the bcm fixes went into 2.6.21
2007-04-28T13:15:00.000Z	eck	exs	is it a source tarball?
2007-04-28T13:15:00.000Z	exs	eck	 I don't know..  it's there http://museek.thegraveyard.org/
2007-04-28T13:16:00.000Z	eck	exs	apt-get build-dep museekd and then unpack the tarball and do ./configure; make; sudo make install
2007-04-28T13:16:00.000Z	exs	eck	 apt-get build-dep museekd
2007-04-28T13:17:00.000Z	exs	eck	 Unable to find a source package for museek
2007-04-28T13:17:00.000Z	eck	exs	doyou have deb-src lines in your sources.list?
2007-04-28T13:17:00.000Z	exs	eck	 no
2007-04-28T13:18:00.000Z	eck	exs	add a deb-src line for universe, apt-get update, and then retry it
