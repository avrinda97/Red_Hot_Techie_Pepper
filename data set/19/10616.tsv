2006-06-01T13:18:00.000Z	ubuntubes	scheuri	: so only router can do that? how about the ubuntu server? can it be?
2006-06-01T13:19:00.000Z	scheuri	ubuntubes	if you configure your ubuntu server to be a router (having at least 2 NICs) then you may...yes.
2006-06-01T13:19:00.000Z	scheuri	ubuntubes	but I never had a linux system configured as router...so I am no help here, sorry

2006-06-01T13:27:00.000Z	ubuntubes	scheuri	: win XP can get access into share samba
2006-06-01T13:28:00.000Z	scheuri	ubuntubes	okay....so win XP can't log in the user because it is authenticatin on a samba server?
2006-06-01T13:30:00.000Z	ubuntubes	scheuri	: yes win XP cannot log in the users to my server1, just during the first win XP logon screen
2006-06-01T13:30:00.000Z	scheuri	ubuntubes	sorry, cant help then...you might be more lucky at samba-channel
2006-06-01T13:31:00.000Z	ubuntubes	scheuri	: but when the users access from "my network places" then the popup window asking for username n password is ok.. they can access easily
