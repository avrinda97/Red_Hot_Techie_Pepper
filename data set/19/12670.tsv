2005-09-28T15:24:00.000Z	Lars_G	kemik	Welcome to the club
2005-09-28T15:29:00.000Z	kemik	Lars_G	 you have a repos / link to 1.0.6 version ?
2005-09-28T15:29:00.000Z	Lars_G	kemik	? nope.
2005-09-28T15:30:00.000Z	kemik	Lars_G	 and  you've not gotten firefox back&running ?
2005-09-28T15:30:00.000Z	Lars_G	kemik	I'm still using 1.0.6
2005-09-28T15:31:00.000Z	Lars_G	kemik	From before the update, I've not updated yet.
2005-09-28T15:31:00.000Z	Lars_G	kemik	Plus the 1.0.7 in the offitial repos should work.
2005-09-28T15:32:00.000Z	kemik	Lars_G	 only got the official repos. added
2005-09-28T15:32:00.000Z	kemik	Lars_G	 it installs, but refuses to 'start' ....
2005-09-28T15:32:00.000Z	Lars_G	kemik	What's the error if you start it from command line?
2005-09-28T15:33:00.000Z	kemik	Lars_G	 no error
2005-09-28T15:33:00.000Z	kemik	Lars_G	 nothing happens, tahts all
2005-09-28T15:33:00.000Z	Lars_G	kemik	It just doesn't runs?
2005-09-28T15:33:00.000Z	Lars_G	kemik	I'd tell you to strace it, but that'd be more confusing than helping.
2005-09-28T15:34:00.000Z	kemik	Lars_G	 resolved it ... somehow it was running a firefox process in the background.... killed it and restarted firefox
2005-09-28T15:35:00.000Z	Lars_G	kemik	You had a firefox process hung, yes. it detects the process and thinks it's already up. sorry it didn't come to mind.
2005-09-28T15:35:00.000Z	kemik	Lars_G	 thx for reminding me of the CLI ;)
2005-09-28T15:35:00.000Z	Lars_G	kemik	Np
