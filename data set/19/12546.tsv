2005-09-10T10:36:00.000Z	TrekCycling		what kernel is the next ubuntu release supposed to use?
2005-09-10T10:36:00.000Z	bob2	TrekCycling	2.6.12, of course
2005-09-10T10:36:00.000Z	TrekCycling	bob2	Okay
2005-09-10T10:37:00.000Z	TrekCycling	bob2	Wasn't sure how closely it tracked Debian current vs. tracking what's current in general.
2005-09-10T10:37:00.000Z	TrekCycling	bob2	Are you running breezy?
2005-09-10T10:37:00.000Z	bob2	TrekCycling	no
2005-09-10T10:38:00.000Z	TrekCycling	bob2	I can't get WPA to work under any distro, but I'm guessing it will work better under the latest ubuntu
2005-09-10T10:41:00.000Z	TrekCycling	bob2	Really? That bad right now?
2005-09-10T10:41:00.000Z	bob2	TrekCycling	I just don't see the point of wpa
2005-09-10T10:41:00.000Z	TrekCycling	bob2	Dude, I don't know. I thought it was more secure or something. :-)
2005-09-10T10:42:00.000Z	TrekCycling	bob2	Maybe ipsec is the way to go.
2005-10-08T09:22:00.000Z	bob2	TrekCycling	to do what?
2005-10-08T09:22:00.000Z	TrekCycling	bob2	I want to define where to find JAVA_HOME, CATALINA_HOME, ANT_HOME, things like that...
2005-10-08T09:22:00.000Z	TrekCycling	bob2	Also add eclipse manually to the PATH
2005-10-08T09:24:00.000Z	bob2	TrekCycling	/etc/bash.bashrc or so
2005-10-08T09:24:00.000Z	bob2	TrekCycling	sure it is
2005-10-08T09:24:00.000Z	bob2	TrekCycling	mysql-server
2005-10-08T09:25:00.000Z	bob2	TrekCycling	then ignore that
