2009-02-14T11:08:00.000Z	bpcomp		is there a better channel for asking package manager specific question?
2009-02-14T11:08:00.000Z	rww	bpcomp	not really, no
2009-02-14T11:09:00.000Z	bpcomp	rww	could you take a loo at this then please http://paste.ubuntu.com/117925/
2009-02-14T11:10:00.000Z	rww	bpcomp	It's complaining that /etc/init.d/lpd doesn't exist. You could try issuing the following command: sudo touch /etc/init.d/lpd
2009-02-14T11:10:00.000Z	bpcomp	rww	I manually checked the folder and lpd doesn't exist
2009-02-14T11:10:00.000Z	rww	bpcomp	I know, hence it complaining. The touch command creates a new, empty file with the name specified.
2009-02-14T11:11:00.000Z	bpcomp	rww	ah, I did not know that, thanks.

2009-02-14T11:13:00.000Z	bpcomp	rww	what permissions should I give it?
2009-02-14T11:15:00.000Z	rww	bpcomp	huh, that's odd. Try chmod 777 /etc/init.d/lpd, then remember to delete the file when the uninstall is done: rm /etc/init.d/lpd

2009-02-14T11:17:00.000Z	rww	bpcomp	*sigh* Okay, this is gonna require a different approach. Give me a minute.
2009-02-14T11:18:00.000Z	rww	bpcomp	Do you have the package "cups-bsd" installed? If not, install it.
2009-02-14T11:19:00.000Z	bpcomp	rww	I know this is weird but what we just did fixed my main problem
2009-02-14T11:19:00.000Z	rww	bpcomp	Heh. So things are working now? Or do you still have problems?
2009-02-14T11:20:00.000Z	bpcomp	rww	every time I tried to install updates or anything new, remove old programs etc it couldn't proceed because of the brother printer drivers being in an error state
2009-02-14T11:20:00.000Z	bpcomp	rww	I think the brother drivers are still bjorked but I can actually do other things with my package manager now
2009-02-14T11:21:00.000Z	bpcomp	rww	 so you fixed my main problem. I'll try and figure the drivers out on my own now, thanks!
2009-02-14T11:21:00.000Z	rww	bpcomp	excellent! Glad I could help :)
