2011-02-22T10:16:00.000Z	nroy1	Jordan_U	 i am currently on xp. ubuntu is having some serious problems, cause i messed up some stuff. the thing is, the extended partition on sdb is showing insanely huge space even on windows. i just want to remove the linux partition now, and readjust the partitions
2011-02-22T10:17:00.000Z	Jordan_U	nroy1	Can you boot from a liveCD?
2011-02-22T10:17:00.000Z	nroy1	Jordan_U	yes i can, but gparted isn't helping
2011-02-22T10:18:00.000Z	Jordan_U	nroy1	parted itself gives descriptive error messages which should tell you exactly what is wrong with the partition table.
2011-02-22T10:20:00.000Z	nroy1	Jordan_U	the entire sdb swows up as unpopulated in gparted
2011-02-22T10:20:00.000Z	Jordan_U	nroy1	I understand.
2011-02-22T10:26:00.000Z	nroy1	Jordan_U	 any ideas? is there a boot-cd version of the gnome disk utility?
2011-02-22T10:27:00.000Z	Jordan_U	nroy1	Palimpsest is included in recent Ubuntu LiveCDs, but I highly recommend figuring out what is wrong with your partition table before trying to modify it further.
2011-02-22T10:28:00.000Z	Jordan_U	nroy1	If you don't you risk serious data loss.
2011-02-22T10:31:00.000Z	nroy1	Jordan_U	honestly, there ARE some bad sectors in both the disks, but i have managed to keep those areas in the free (unpartitioned) zone. And it seems some drives have wrong info on start/end of sectors/cyllinders. I hope manually adjusting them via a good partition manager like disk-uti will fix it. but CAN i use disk utility via boot cd... it is not available on solaris.
2011-02-22T10:33:00.000Z	Jordan_U	nroy1	Yes you can use palimpsest from an Ubuntu 10.10 liveCD. But please pastebin the output of "sudo parted -l" before you do so.
2011-02-22T10:35:00.000Z	nroy1	Jordan_U	 ok, i"ll see you from the live cd in a min
2011-02-22T10:54:00.000Z	nroy1	Jordan_U	here's the info you wanted: http://pastebin.com/M1bz2PEA
2011-02-22T10:58:00.000Z	Jordan_U	nroy1	Ok, so it was just the fact that your hard drive has hardware problems that was creating issues for GParted. So while you should not trust this drive with any important data, it's probably no more dangerous to use palimpsest to modify partitions than it is to use the drive at all.
2011-02-22T11:00:00.000Z	nroy1	Jordan_U	 ok, but i'm still gonna need help adjusting the partitions.
2011-02-22T11:47:00.000Z	nroy1	Jordan_U	can you help me with the resizing of the partitions please?
2011-02-22T11:49:00.000Z	Jordan_U	nroy1	No, I don't know how to resize partitions on failing drives.
2011-02-22T11:49:00.000Z	nroy1	Jordan_U	just for the time being... until i get a new drive
