2008-09-01T12:44:00.000Z	jake_		I'm connected to the internet fine but for some reason eth0 is not showing up as connected.
2008-09-01T12:44:00.000Z	jake_		!info eth0
2008-09-01T12:44:00.000Z	jake_		ahh
2008-09-01T12:44:00.000Z	jake_		well that's just silly
2008-09-01T12:45:00.000Z	jake_		!eth0
2008-09-01T12:45:00.000Z	cef	jake_	sure you don't have more than one ethernet? or wireless?
2008-09-01T12:46:00.000Z	cef	jake_	do you have anything suspicious is in /etc/network/interfaces ?? you might have it renamed perhaps?
2008-09-01T12:47:00.000Z	cef	jake_	I've got a box that acts as a firewall and I've renamed the interfaces to int0 and ext0
2008-09-01T12:48:00.000Z	jake_	cef	Everything looks ok to me. iface eth0 inet static
2008-09-01T12:49:00.000Z	cef	jake_	what about 'route -n' ??
2008-09-01T12:53:00.000Z	cef	jake_	any luck?
2008-09-01T12:55:00.000Z	cef	jake_	sounds like network-manager is just being goofy
2008-09-01T12:56:00.000Z	cef	jake_	well.. if gkrellm decies it's going to get info from network-manager (eg: via dbus).. that'd explain it
2008-09-01T12:56:00.000Z	cef	jake_	actually, is dbus working properly? (no idea off the top of my head how to check.. but it seems the logical place to check next)
2008-09-01T12:57:00.000Z	jake_	cef	I'll have a look
2008-09-01T13:09:00.000Z	cef	jake_	yes?
2008-09-01T13:11:00.000Z	cef	jake_	yeah I didn't see it either.. oops!
2008-09-01T13:12:00.000Z	cef	jake_	ugh. yuk. very yuk. oh well, least you know it works at least. Was this the default user on the machine from install, or a new one?
2008-09-01T13:13:00.000Z	cef	jake_	cool.. I ask simply because I thought perhaps the user wasn't added to a necessary group to do this sort of stuff.
