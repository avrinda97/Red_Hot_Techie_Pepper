2008-10-30T19:23:00.000Z	maco		er...
2008-10-30T19:23:00.000Z	maco		oh he's gone
2008-10-30T19:24:00.000Z	musictoto	maco	i don't speak portuguese... why do you give me that notice ?
2008-10-30T19:24:00.000Z	maco	musictoto	i was trying to send it to mussuline, but he quit a moment before
2008-10-30T19:24:00.000Z	musictoto	maco	ok no problem :)
2010-06-21T11:00:00.000Z	maco	musictoto	because most people dont know if they have 32 or 64 bit computers
2010-06-21T11:00:00.000Z	maco	musictoto	and if they go "oooh 64's a bigger number, that makes it better, right???" and it doesnt boot, they get not happy
2010-06-21T11:02:00.000Z	musictoto	maco	rww: to know if your processor supports 32 bit rather than 64 bit is only a search away though ? that's the only reason ?
2010-06-21T11:02:00.000Z	maco	musictoto	it used to be that flash, java, and skype didnt work on 64bit, but thats not been the case in a couple of years
2010-06-21T11:03:00.000Z	maco	musictoto	and um most people dont know about googling for hardware. what would they even google for "dell computer amd64 or i386?"
2010-06-21T11:03:00.000Z	maco	musictoto	expecting people to know their cpu's model name is...expecting far far too much
2010-06-21T11:03:00.000Z	musictoto	maco	although right now adobe doesn't offer flash for 64 bit...
2010-06-21T11:04:00.000Z	maco	musictoto	but 32bit flash works fine on 64bit linux ;-)
2010-06-21T11:04:00.000Z	musictoto	maco	ok.. in fact i thought 32 bit programs could be emulated, i wasn't sure though
2010-06-21T11:06:00.000Z	maco	musictoto	there's a package with some 32bit libs to make them work
2010-06-21T11:07:00.000Z	musictoto	maco	ok thanks, that's all i need to know right now
2010-06-21T11:08:00.000Z	musictoto	maco	maybe i'll come crying for help when the AMD64 machine is really here :)
