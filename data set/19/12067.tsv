2005-10-16T14:17:00.000Z	foXgamer		mine isn't homework. It's just a theory I have. Nothing that HAS to get done. Just wanna do it that's all.
2005-10-16T14:18:00.000Z	foXgamer		<--feels totally inadequate. Again.
2005-10-16T14:18:00.000Z	foXgamer		lol
2005-10-16T14:18:00.000Z	foXgamer		why is everyone so brainy? why can't i be brainy?
2005-10-16T14:19:00.000Z	foXgamer		lol. I wouldn't let you waste your time ormandj. But thanks. :)
2005-10-16T14:19:00.000Z	foXgamer		I said the other day that I would love to be more stoopid so I could be happier
2005-10-16T14:20:00.000Z	foXgamer		Richard Branson is dyslexic
2005-10-16T14:20:00.000Z	foXgamer		wouldn't that make you stoopided?
2005-10-16T14:21:00.000Z	foXgamer		I would
2005-10-16T14:21:00.000Z	foXgamer		That's what I was told
2005-10-16T14:22:00.000Z	topyli	foXgamer	that was more true when we all had 32M of RAM
2005-10-16T14:22:00.000Z	foXgamer	topyli	wins! That makes much more sense than my idea :)
2005-10-16T14:38:00.000Z	topyli	foXgamer	sometimes you want some functionality in iptables (IP masquerading for example) but it's not necessary for security
2005-10-16T14:39:00.000Z	foXgamer	topyli	eh? Damn. This is all new to me. I have a lot to learn.
2005-10-16T14:39:00.000Z	topyli	foXgamer	by default, ubuntu has no services listening to any ports anyway
2005-10-16T14:40:00.000Z	topyli	foXgamer	if you set up a service, then you most likely don't want to immediately block its port by a firewall :)
2005-10-16T14:41:00.000Z	foXgamer	topyli	I do have a website and an eggdrop in a chatroom. Will it help or hinder having the firewall?
2005-10-16T14:42:00.000Z	topyli	foXgamer	you can use a firewall but then you will of course open the respective ports for those services to be useful
2005-10-16T14:43:00.000Z	foXgamer	topyli	Thanks for the info :) I will have a play
