2007-12-03T16:44:00.000Z	gvsa123		hey... is there an application in the repos that can remove audio from a video?
2007-12-03T16:44:00.000Z	ikonia	gvsa123	any of the dvd rippers can strip the audio into a seperate file
2007-12-03T16:45:00.000Z	gvsa123	ikonia	it's a home made video though
2007-12-10T16:25:00.000Z	ikonia	gvsa123	yahoo has a pop3 service, as does hotmail, but I think you have to pay for hotmail
2007-12-10T16:25:00.000Z	gvsa123	ikonia	so that means it's not possible?
2007-12-10T16:26:00.000Z	ikonia	gvsa123	no, evolution will work with pop3 accounts, but you have to pay hotmail/yahoo to enable pop3 access for your account
