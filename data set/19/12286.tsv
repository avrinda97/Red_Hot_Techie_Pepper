2007-10-05T09:43:00.000Z	usr13		Hypothetical question:  If a user does not want to wait for the repos to get OO 2.3, what would be the best way to upgrade?
2007-10-05T09:44:00.000Z	usr13		Should one uninstall 2.2 first? or ...?
2007-10-05T09:44:00.000Z	usr13		Has anyone here upgraded to OO 2.3 yet?
2007-10-05T09:44:00.000Z	usr13		Has anyone tried efax plugin for OO 2.3?
2007-10-05T09:46:00.000Z	usr13		 Any ideas on how long it will take before the repositories to pick up OO 2.3?
2007-10-05T09:48:00.000Z	Dr_willis	usr13	 thats how ubuntus 6 mo release cycle works.
2008-08-26T05:47:00.000Z	Dr_willis	usr13	 i dident think ubuntu used the inittab.
2008-08-26T05:47:00.000Z	usr13	Dr_willis	What does it use?
2008-08-26T06:26:00.000Z	Dr_willis	usr13	 sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop   for example?
2008-08-26T06:26:00.000Z	usr13	Dr_willis	Yes...
2008-08-26T06:27:00.000Z	usr13	Dr_willis	Thank you very much.
2008-08-26T06:27:00.000Z	Dr_willis	usr13	 theres similer meta-packages.. but it depends on what you need.. thers also 'ubuntu-restricted-exctras' you may want to install
2012-07-19T04:54:00.000Z	usr13	Dr_willis	I think you just add Listen 192.168.x.x:631
2012-07-19T04:55:00.000Z	usr13	Dr_willis	... right under Listen localhost:631
2012-07-27T02:19:00.000Z	usr13	Dr_willis	I have a separate MS Windows system.  It gets turned on once in a while.    But my laptop, I have dual boot and grub on MBR, and again, rarely use MS Windows.
2012-07-29T03:16:00.000Z	usr13	Dr_willis	flashplugin or flashplayer does some goofy stuff.
2012-07-29T03:16:00.000Z	usr13	Dr_willis	And that may very well be the case with soulstitchmmo
2012-07-29T03:17:00.000Z	usr13	Dr_willis	Well, that is probably a better alternative.
