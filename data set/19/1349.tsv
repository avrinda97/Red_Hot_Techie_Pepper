2011-02-20T22:02:00.000Z	MysterX		grrr... has someone any idea to get 1080p movies play smooth (not a 100% cpu..)
2011-02-20T22:02:00.000Z	King-C	MysterX	Install your proprietary graphics card
2011-02-20T22:03:00.000Z	King-C	MysterX	Disable desktop effects.
2011-02-20T22:03:00.000Z	MysterX	King-C	what do you mean by proprietary graphic card?
2011-02-20T22:03:00.000Z	King-C	MysterX	Driver. System-administration-hardware drivers
2011-02-20T22:04:00.000Z	MysterX	King-C	ah i see yes i've got one Geforche8500 and installed my drivers from the nvidea site
2011-02-20T22:05:00.000Z	King-C	MysterX	Ok. Rightclick your desktop, change destop background, visual effects, none
2011-02-20T22:06:00.000Z	MysterX	King-C	done what you told but still 100%
2011-02-20T22:07:00.000Z	King-C	MysterX	An 8500 is a pretty old, weak graphics card. It simply mightn't be able to do 1080p. It depends on the codec they're using too. If it's h264 you're probably bunched
2011-02-20T22:08:00.000Z	MysterX	King-C	but it works undr vista
2011-02-20T22:08:00.000Z	King-C	MysterX	I haven't followed this story for a while, but I seem to remember reading something once about Linux being unable to do hardware accelerated H264 playback.
2011-02-20T22:08:00.000Z	King-C	MysterX	What player are you using?
2011-02-20T22:15:00.000Z	MysterX	King-C	VLC is using 95% -100% cpu ...
2011-02-20T22:15:00.000Z	King-C	MysterX	OK, how powerful is your CPU
2011-02-20T22:16:00.000Z	MysterX	King-C	where can i see that?
2011-02-20T22:17:00.000Z	MysterX	King-C	AMD Phenom(tm) 9500 Quad-core
2011-02-20T22:17:00.000Z	King-C	MysterX	That should be fine. Your video must be H264. That's very intense to decode
2011-02-20T22:18:00.000Z	MysterX	King-C	Too bad that linux has problem with it.. where MS Vista running smooth..
2011-02-20T22:19:00.000Z	King-C	MysterX	It's because H264 is a proprietary codec. They don't give out the necessary information to integrate those decoders into Linux drivers.
