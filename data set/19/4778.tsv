2009-11-06T09:18:00.000Z	loquitus		How would I install the 32 bit version of the MySQL dev libraries on my system? I am on a 64 bit install of Ubuntu but I need to build some stuff that links against MySQL and needs to be running on a 32 bit machine.
2009-11-06T09:20:00.000Z	loquitus		 frostburn3: negative. I cannot. I need to build and package everything here on my machine. would be nice to have the luxury but often you can't have access to the target.
2009-11-06T09:20:00.000Z	loquitus		surely I can just install the 32 bit mysql libs here
2009-11-06T09:21:00.000Z	scunizi	loquitus	are you terminal based only or do you have a gui?
2009-11-06T09:22:00.000Z	loquitus	scunizi	the machine I am on is gui
2009-11-06T09:23:00.000Z	scunizi	loquitus	search synaptic for mysql .. hopefully you should see a reference for the -dev file
2009-11-06T09:24:00.000Z	loquitus	scunizi	synaptic says I have the dev files installed already... presumaby because I do. but I only have the 64 bit version
2009-11-06T09:25:00.000Z	scunizi	loquitus	ah.. you looking for the 32 bit?
2009-11-06T09:25:00.000Z	loquitus	scunizi	affirmative. I am 64 bit but trying to build 32 bit.
2009-11-06T09:25:00.000Z	scunizi	loquitus	do you already have the 32 bit libs install as well?
2009-11-06T09:26:00.000Z	scunizi	loquitus	karmic?
2009-11-06T09:26:00.000Z	loquitus	scunizi	jaunty. I got way too f*cked over by Karmic on my two other machines to mess with it on my main baby.
2009-11-06T09:26:00.000Z	scunizi	loquitus	hang on .. looking
2009-11-06T09:26:00.000Z	loquitus	scunizi	I don't think the 32 bit libs are installed. that's the whole problem.
2009-11-06T09:27:00.000Z	loquitus	scunizi	I think that synaptic is right in saying I have the libs... I do, but it does not give me a way to say "hey, I want 32 bit versions too, so install em!"
2009-11-06T09:28:00.000Z	scunizi	loquitus	I'm looking in packages.ubuntu.com to see what's there.
2009-11-06T09:31:00.000Z	scunizi	loquitus	I don't see either version there.. at least one starting with mysql-XXX.. there are some libs with the -dev at the end but you can't tell if they are 32 or 64 bit
2009-11-06T09:32:00.000Z	loquitus	scunizi	could be why synaptic does not know squat about this...
2009-11-06T09:32:00.000Z	loquitus	scunizi	gonna try getlibs
