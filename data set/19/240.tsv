2012-06-04T18:23:00.000Z	deepspeed		Or another lightweight window manager like fluxbox/blackbox
2012-06-04T18:24:00.000Z	deepspeed		Yea, but openbox by itself without the menus and such is much faster.
2012-06-04T18:25:00.000Z	deepspeed		Is there a way to put enlightenment on a standard ubuntu distro without too much trouble?
2012-06-04T18:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	deepspeed	what is the output of:  lsb_release -sc
2012-06-04T18:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	deepspeed	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Enlightenment
2012-06-04T18:28:00.000Z	deepspeed	ActionParsnip	thanks.
2012-06-04T18:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	deepspeed	don't add the jaunty repo, jaunty is dead
2012-06-04T18:30:00.000Z	deepspeed	ActionParsnip	thanks.
2012-06-04T18:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	deepspeed	it is light, fluxbox / openbox also don't need a DE so are fast too :)
2012-06-04T18:38:00.000Z	deepspeed	ActionParsnip	yea, I've used them, too, but they seem a little too bare/close to the metal for me.
2012-06-04T18:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	deepspeed	could try flwm if you want bare metal :)
2012-06-04T18:43:00.000Z	deepspeed	ActionParsnip	I'll have to try it out.  I like bare metal sometimes, especially when I want to maximize the terminal and pretend I'm in the matrix.
2012-06-04T18:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	deepspeed	I like it
2012-06-20T15:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	deepspeed	do you want autologin?

2012-06-20T15:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	deepspeed	set a blank keyring pasword and you won't get bothered for a password
2012-06-20T15:01:00.000Z	deepspeed	ActionParsnip	thanks a lot.
2012-06-20T15:03:00.000Z	deepspeed	ActionParsnip	that link you gave me is why I asked here, lol.  I'm using enlightenment, and don't have a 'system' tab on my taskbar.  Do you know how to get to the menu in enlightenment?
2012-06-20T15:05:00.000Z	deepspeed	ActionParsnip	nvm, I found it.  Thanks.
