2006-11-20T10:18:00.000Z	libervisco		Hi
2006-11-20T10:18:00.000Z	libervisco		Has anyone had problems with swap on edgy?
2006-11-20T10:18:00.000Z	libervisco		like, dropping swap?
2006-11-20T10:18:00.000Z	libervisco		I just had to turn swap on
2006-11-20T10:19:00.000Z	libervisco		after I ran out of memory
2006-11-20T10:19:00.000Z	libervisco		it's supposed to be on all the time
2006-11-20T10:19:00.000Z	nile	libervisco	what do you mean by "dropping swap"?
2006-11-20T10:20:00.000Z	libervisco	nile	well, it wasn't turned on
2006-11-20T10:20:00.000Z	libervisco	nile	I've seen that after my comp started crawling due to memory issues
2006-11-20T10:20:00.000Z	libervisco	nile	but swap is put normally in fstab, and was selected normally on install
2006-11-20T10:21:00.000Z	nile	libervisco	you mean it's originally mounted but then disappears over time, randomly?
2006-11-20T10:21:00.000Z	libervisco	nile	seems so
2006-11-20T10:22:00.000Z	libervisco	nile	here is it:
2006-11-20T10:22:00.000Z	libervisco	nile	I turned it on myself now, but I am wondering why wasn't it on all the time
2006-11-20T10:23:00.000Z	nile	libervisco	can you confirm that it was mounted when you booted originally?
2006-11-20T10:23:00.000Z	libervisco	nile	well it's in fstab, but I didn't check right after the boot though
2006-11-20T10:24:00.000Z	nile	libervisco	the line you pasted up there ^^^ is directly from your fstab? it seems to be missing a few fields
2006-11-20T10:24:00.000Z	libervisco	nile	no, it is from swapon -s
2006-11-20T10:25:00.000Z	libervisco	nile	this is from fstab: UUID=200bbc44-ad21-4048-b0c7-6a09a9ed7820 none            swap    sw              0       0
