2005-11-09T08:37:00.000Z	bob2	n0odl3	no
2005-11-09T08:37:00.000Z	bob2	n0odl3	it's the same as linux users looking down on freebsd users
2005-11-09T08:38:00.000Z	bob2	n0odl3	only the stupid teenagers do it, and they can be safely ignored
2005-11-09T08:38:00.000Z	bob2	n0odl3	I'm sure many freebsd users are annoyed at the influx of clueless users to unix in general
