2007-12-21T17:20:00.000Z	lesshaste_		how do you run something in the background that you run with sudo?
2007-12-21T17:20:00.000Z	lesshaste_		sudo foo &
2007-12-21T17:20:00.000Z	lesshaste_		doesn't work
2007-12-21T17:20:00.000Z	lesshaste_		sudo "foo &" ?
2007-12-21T17:21:00.000Z	Pici	lesshaste_	That should work.
2007-12-21T17:21:00.000Z	lesshaste_	Pici	which one?
2007-12-21T17:56:00.000Z	Pici	lesshaste_	When?
2007-12-21T17:58:00.000Z	lesshaste_	Pici	certainly before March 2007
2007-12-21T17:59:00.000Z	Pici	lesshaste_	Likely the amount of changes needed to get a newer version to work properly were too big of a task.
2007-12-21T17:59:00.000Z	lesshaste_	Pici	any idea what is going on?  The version that comes with gutsy is basically broken
2007-12-21T17:59:00.000Z	lesshaste_	Pici	hmm.. that's odd
2007-12-21T17:59:00.000Z	Pici	lesshaste_	But you said yourself that the one in backports is fixed.
2007-12-21T17:59:00.000Z	lesshaste_	Pici	yes
2007-12-21T18:00:00.000Z	lesshaste_	Pici	it was actually released in 2006 it seems!
2007-12-21T18:00:00.000Z	Pici	lesshaste_	Azureus's sourceforge page says it was released on 01/25/2007
2007-12-21T18:01:00.000Z	lesshaste_	Pici	ok... that's still 11 months ago! :)
2007-12-21T18:03:00.000Z	Pici	lesshaste_	I really don't have an answer for you.  I know that there was someone working on the Azeurus problems, but I dont know what the problems actually were.
2007-12-21T18:04:00.000Z	lesshaste_	Pici	ok... it's all very odd as version 3 is the current one in any cased
2007-12-21T18:06:00.000Z	Pici	lesshaste_	Not official repo, I can't speak for 3rd party ones.
