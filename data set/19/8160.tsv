2007-04-30T09:36:00.000Z	mboman	getoo	the laptop with connects to the internet, does it have any other connectivity? And how do you connect to the internet?
2007-04-30T09:36:00.000Z	getoo	mboman	using cable
2007-04-30T09:37:00.000Z	mboman	getoo	cable modem? well, the most painless way is to get one of those sub-$100 routers and plug it in
2007-04-30T09:37:00.000Z	mboman	getoo	else you need to do a ad-hoc network and masqurading
2007-04-30T09:37:00.000Z	getoo	mboman	 i mean anyway i can connect using my wifi  connecting both wirelesly and being able to get online
