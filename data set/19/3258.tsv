2009-09-21T08:00:00.000Z	saru		Hello guys
2009-09-21T08:00:00.000Z	saru		New install of Ubuntu :)
2009-09-21T08:01:00.000Z	saru		I was wondering if anyone knew if Ubuntu 9.04 comes with Beryl?
2009-09-21T08:02:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	saru	no, compiz instead.. i believe beryl is dead now.
2009-09-21T08:02:00.000Z	saru	bastid_raZor	how do i activate compiz or do i have to install it via add/remove programs?
2009-09-21T08:03:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	saru	system>preferences>appearances then the visual tab .
2009-09-21T08:04:00.000Z	saru	bastid_raZor	just says None / Normal / Extra
2009-09-21T08:05:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	saru	correct, choose nomral or extra.. also you should install this.
2009-09-21T08:05:00.000Z	bastid_raZor		!ccsm | saru
2009-09-21T08:05:00.000Z	saru		what is better, ccsm or compizconfig-settings-manager?
2009-09-21T08:06:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	saru	compizconfig-settings-manager
2009-09-21T08:07:00.000Z	saru	bastid_raZor	i only see Advanced Desktop Effects Settings (ccsm) and Compiz Fusion Icon under add/remove applications
2009-09-21T08:08:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	saru	use apt-get or synaptic
2009-09-21T08:12:00.000Z	saru	bastid_raZor	do i need to restart my windows manager after installing compizconfig-manager-settings?
2009-09-21T08:13:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	saru	no, you need to have selected normal or extra.. if no errors then compiz is enabled and running
2009-09-21T08:14:00.000Z	saru		ok i keep trying to figure out how to do the 3D desktop etc and im not seeing options or shortcuts for the keys to push
2009-09-21T08:14:00.000Z	saru	bastid_raZor	i've got it set to extra right now, and when i move windows and such the effects do work
2009-09-21T08:16:00.000Z	saru	bastid_raZor	lol im stupid i forgot to open the compiz manager and set the settings there :)
2009-09-21T08:16:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	saru	i don't know all the little tweaks of compiz. there is a #compiz channel. soreau knows much more than I.
