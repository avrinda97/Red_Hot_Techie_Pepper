2005-04-23T14:02:00.000Z	pepsi		presumable, the release of hoary is why i am no longer receiving updates?
2005-04-23T14:03:00.000Z	pepsi		presumably, that is
2005-04-23T14:03:00.000Z	pepsi		naw im running hoary, but miss my daily updates
2005-04-23T14:04:00.000Z	eyequeue	pepsi	 then change to breezy once it is out
2005-06-20T14:26:00.000Z	eyequeue	pepsi	 rather
2005-06-26T09:32:00.000Z	eyequeue	pepsi	 whats up
2005-06-26T09:33:00.000Z	pepsi	eyequeue	did you do the update of all the X stuff a day or two ago?
2005-06-26T09:33:00.000Z	eyequeue	pepsi	 unfortunately
2005-06-26T09:34:00.000Z	eyequeue	pepsi	 now i have no vt switching while gdm is active
2005-06-26T09:34:00.000Z	pepsi	eyequeue	hehe... i had to remove the Generic Mouse line in xorg.conf and then it still wouldnt work unless i chose the Gnome session isntead of System Default
2005-06-26T09:34:00.000Z	pepsi	eyequeue	right.. same problem :D
2005-06-26T09:34:00.000Z	eyequeue	pepsi	 if you find a solution, msgserv me (or msg on forums, or or or, hrh)
2005-06-26T09:35:00.000Z	pepsi	eyequeue	did you have to change the session when you login? i dont even know what i means really
2005-06-26T09:36:00.000Z	eyequeue	pepsi	i had to go to a failsafe once, then to gnome after that, now it is set to "last" and it works as before
2005-06-26T09:36:00.000Z	pepsi	eyequeue	ok, so you had to fiddle with that too
2005-06-26T09:36:00.000Z	eyequeue	pepsi	 yeah, quite similar here and there
2005-06-26T09:37:00.000Z	eyequeue	pepsi	 failsafe means it won't run your system > preferences > sessions, settings
2005-06-26T09:37:00.000Z	eyequeue	pepsi	 not that it helps you now any, just so you'll know what it means
2005-06-26T09:38:00.000Z	pepsi	eyequeue	yeah.. thanks
