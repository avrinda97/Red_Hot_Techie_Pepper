2010-06-02T06:33:00.000Z	EruditeHermit		hey, does anyone know how to set GDM theme in Lucid?
2010-06-02T06:34:00.000Z	EruditeHermit		after my upgrade I got stuck with the old theme
2010-06-02T06:34:00.000Z	acerimmer_	EruditeHermit	System>Preferences>Appearance
2010-06-02T06:35:00.000Z	EruditeHermit	acerimmer_	where in there sets the GDM theme?
2010-06-02T06:35:00.000Z	acerimmer_	EruditeHermit	Appearance>Theme
2010-06-02T06:35:00.000Z	EruditeHermit	acerimmer_	that sets the theme once logged in, not the GDM theme
2010-06-02T06:36:00.000Z	acerimmer_	EruditeHermit	so you want to change login screen??
2010-06-02T06:36:00.000Z	EruditeHermit		yeah
2010-06-02T06:36:00.000Z	acerimmer_	EruditeHermit	wait one
2010-06-02T06:37:00.000Z	EruditeHermit	acerimmer_	lucid seems to have removed the way you did it in earlier versions of Ubuntu
2010-06-02T06:38:00.000Z	acerimmer_	EruditeHermit	true.  you do change it with ubuntu tweak
2010-06-02T06:38:00.000Z	EruditeHermit	acerimmer_	what package is that or can you link me to how to get it?
2010-06-02T06:39:00.000Z	acerimmer_	EruditeHermit	OR my suggestion is to use THIS  http://maketecheasier.com/change-login-and-boot-screen-in-ubuntu-lucid/2010/05/13
2010-06-02T06:39:00.000Z	EruditeHermit	acerimmer_	ah thanks I'll try that
2010-06-02T06:42:00.000Z	EruditeHermit	acerimmer_	btw, any ideas why it didn't update my GDM theme on the upgrade?
2010-06-02T06:43:00.000Z	acerimmer_	EruditeHermit	sorry, no idea.  probably something with the upgrade method, i.e clean install vs. synaptic or something
2010-06-02T06:45:00.000Z	EruditeHermit	acerimmer_	thanks for your help
2010-06-02T06:45:00.000Z	EruditeHermit		i'm going to try it now bbl
2010-06-02T06:45:00.000Z	acerimmer_	EruditeHermit	hope that works.  I played with all of the options and eventually went with ubuntu studio defaults
