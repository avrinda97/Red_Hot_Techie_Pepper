2006-10-18T09:42:00.000Z	Aoirthoi1		I tried to get my wifi up..and it seemed to recognized..but I had wired eth0 set to static ip..so I thought that was the cause of the wifi not working and deleted all settings in my lan sections
2006-10-18T09:42:00.000Z	Aoirthoi1		going there now...but now I cant even sudu
2006-10-18T09:43:00.000Z	Aoirthoi1		baxter thats a type but yes I know
2006-10-18T09:44:00.000Z	Aoirthoi1		when I type sudo I get the msg: sudo: unable to lookup joe-nb via gethostbyname()
2006-10-18T09:45:00.000Z	Aoirthoi1		(joe-nb is the hostname on my laptop..but as I said I deleted all network settings without realizing what I had done)
2006-10-18T09:47:00.000Z	Aoirthoi1		wastrel rebooting now:)
2006-10-18T09:47:00.000Z	Aoirthoi1		ok is that the same as recovery mode?
2006-10-18T09:48:00.000Z	Aoirthoi1		Thanks Wastrel..coming up in recovery mode now
2006-10-18T09:49:00.000Z	Aoirthoi1		ok I am there.. /etc/hostname has the name of my notebook (joe-nb)
2006-10-18T09:50:00.000Z	Aoirthoi1		I assume that is correct?
2006-10-18T09:51:00.000Z	timfrost	Aoirthoi1	that is correct.  But is there a line with that name in /etc/hosts?
2006-10-18T09:52:00.000Z	Aoirthoi1	timfrost	no..I just did a search on the forums and came up with this link http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=273344&highlight=%2Fetc%2Fhosts
2006-10-18T09:52:00.000Z	Aoirthoi1		So I am assuming I have to have a line like that in order to sudo aetc?
2006-10-18T09:53:00.000Z	timfrost	Aoirthoi1	yes.
2006-10-18T09:53:00.000Z	Aoirthoi1		thanks Timfrost and wastrel

2006-10-18T09:54:00.000Z	timfrost	Aoirthoi1	good luck
2006-10-18T09:56:00.000Z	Aoirthoi1		ok Ive changed it so I assume just a reboot is in order?
2006-10-18T09:57:00.000Z	timfrost	Aoirthoi1	yes.
