2006-10-01T16:20:00.000Z	gnomefreak	kent	its not gonna happen like that
2006-10-01T16:20:00.000Z	kent	gnomefreak	why not?  firefox can embedd totem, mplayer etc,  why not evince?
2006-10-01T16:21:00.000Z	gnomefreak	kent	try mozplugger than if anything does it thats it
2006-10-01T16:21:00.000Z	gnomefreak	kent	i dont remember if it does pdf though
2006-10-01T16:22:00.000Z	kent	gnomefreak	i did try mozplugger just recently  but it had a configuration-file in m4 or something which was more than I wanted to do. I just want to check "Embedd inside firefox" buttons,  not learn a new script language :)
2006-10-01T16:23:00.000Z	gnomefreak	kent	apt-cache search pdf  but i already did it and im telling you you wont find what you are looking for
2006-10-01T16:24:00.000Z	kent	gnomefreak	i went with mozilla-acroread then.  it should work like expected.. i belive
