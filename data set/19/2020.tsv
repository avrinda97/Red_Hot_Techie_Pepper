2012-05-25T21:34:00.000Z	nemo		I don't particularly care *what* they chose to do. they are just replacing an interface that did work
2012-05-25T21:35:00.000Z	nemo		there's an open bug on that. has been open for a while
2012-05-25T21:36:00.000Z	nemo		my SO is using Unity2D 'cause 3D was too unreliable (crashy/sluggish) on her intel gfx card
2012-05-25T21:37:00.000Z	cypher-neo	nemo	Don't like Unity? Try something else, like Xubuntu or GNOME-Shell.
2012-05-25T21:37:00.000Z	nemo	cypher-neo	...
2012-05-25T21:38:00.000Z	cypher-neo	nemo	I found an amazing XFCE distro called Voyager. It doesn't use Unity at all so you shouldn't have a problem it.
2012-05-25T21:42:00.000Z	cypher-neo	nemo	Out of curiousity, which XFCE distro did you use? Standard Xubuntu, or another X flavor?
2012-05-25T21:43:00.000Z	nemo	cypher-neo	I'm not using an XFCE4 distro - I install it on standard ubuntu
2012-05-25T21:43:00.000Z	nemo	cypher-neo	just one more window manager
2012-05-25T21:45:00.000Z	cypher-neo	nemo	Oh, okay. I experimented with a sweet XFCE distro last week called Voyager.
2012-05-25T21:45:00.000Z	nemo	cypher-neo	unfortunately XFCE4 is still not too novice friendly. even doing something simple like adjusting clock. also config is not very integrated/consistent. I wouldn't inflict it on my mom
2012-05-25T21:46:00.000Z	cypher-neo	nemo	Funny... I just adjusted my clock....
2012-05-25T21:47:00.000Z	cypher-neo	nemo	Didn't seem too hard to me.
2012-05-25T21:47:00.000Z	nemo	cypher-neo	try timezone :-p
2012-05-25T21:47:00.000Z	cypher-neo	nemo	Oh... I see what you mean.
2012-05-25T21:49:00.000Z	cypher-neo	nemo	Actually... once I put my mind to figuring it out, it wasn't too difficult to do.
2012-05-25T21:50:00.000Z	nemo	cypher-neo	oh? is there a nice gui for it? last I checked it still had to be done on commandline
2012-05-25T21:50:00.000Z	cypher-neo	nemo	I opened Settings, clicked on Calendar, and there was a Timezone option.
2012-05-25T21:50:00.000Z	nemo	cypher-neo	oh. haha. that doesn't actually change it :)
