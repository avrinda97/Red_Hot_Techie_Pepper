2010-06-11T17:20:00.000Z	simmerz		Hi. I'm trying to send a file via bluetooth to another computer. When I use the Send To nautilus extension, I don't get a list of devices to choose from. any ideas/
2010-06-11T17:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	simmerz	 you do have teh device paired with the pc?
2010-06-11T17:22:00.000Z	simmerz	Dr_Willis	does it have to be paired? surely I can send to an arbitrary device, but the remote side has to accept it
2010-06-11T17:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	simmerz	 err.. no - you normally have to pair bluetooth gizmos for them to send to each other.
2010-06-11T17:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	simmerz	 otherwise all sorts of nasty things can start happening
2010-06-11T17:23:00.000Z	simmerz	Dr_Willis	I've never had that before
2010-06-11T17:24:00.000Z	simmerz	Dr_Willis	btw, this worked fine under Karmic. Just not under Lucid
2010-06-11T17:24:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	simmerz	 i recall some old bluetooth 'attacks' years back  when these things started getting common. Picture sitting on a buss and you get 20+ 'requests to accept' some spam/virus..
2010-06-11T17:25:00.000Z	simmerz	Dr_Willis	you need to pair to use specific devices (HID, or headsets etc)
2010-06-11T17:26:00.000Z	simmerz	Dr_Willis	yep
2010-06-11T17:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	simmerz	 sounds like somthuing that would make me want to not shop at that store
2010-06-11T17:28:00.000Z	simmerz	Dr_Willis	likewise, but it's still there
2010-06-11T17:30:00.000Z	simmerz	Dr_Willis	as it says, pairing is for use where you don't want user intervention in the connection
2010-06-11T17:35:00.000Z	simmerz	Dr_Willis	I still need bluez installed right?
2010-06-11T17:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	simmerz	 no idea. bluetooth worked for me  from the initial install.  FIRST time bluetooth actuallh has worked for me on ubuntu
2010-06-11T17:36:00.000Z	simmerz	Dr_Willis	heh. I had to install various bits previously. This is an upgrade from Karmic, so there *may* be some muck left over from that
2010-06-11T17:36:00.000Z	simmerz	Dr_Willis	do you have bluez installed?
2010-06-11T17:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	simmerz	 not sure,  :) let me look
2010-06-11T17:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	simmerz	 it does seem to be installed
