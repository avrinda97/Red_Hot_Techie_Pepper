2007-02-23T06:11:00.000Z	Anubi1		can someone please help me i am trying to install netbeans but i get the error that the jre is not installed althought i installed it ?
2007-02-23T06:11:00.000Z	ikonia_	Anubi1	is it the right jre ?
2007-02-23T06:12:00.000Z	ikonia_	Anubi1	how did you install it
2007-02-23T06:13:00.000Z	ikonia_	Anubi1	there is your answer then - how can dpkg know about java if you didn't use apt to install it
2007-02-23T06:14:00.000Z	ikonia_	Anubi1	yes - but you didn't use apt to install it - so apt doesn't know about it - so when you try o install anything else- it doesn't know about java
2007-02-23T06:14:00.000Z	ikonia_	Anubi1	use apt to get java out of the ubuntu repo
2007-02-23T06:15:00.000Z	ikonia_	Anubi1	you use the version out of the ubuntu repo
2007-02-23T06:16:00.000Z	ikonia_	Anubi1	are you listening - you install the java version from the ubuntu repo
2007-02-23T06:18:00.000Z	ikonia_	Anubi1	so install it from the ubuntu repo
2007-02-23T06:19:00.000Z	ikonia_	Anubi1	why don't you use java out of the ubuntu repo
2007-02-23T06:21:00.000Z	ikonia_	Anubi1	no your not listening
2007-02-23T06:22:00.000Z	ikonia_	Anubi1	LISTEN ! if you wan to use the bin - thats fine - but nothing within apt-gets source repo's will be aware of java
2007-02-23T06:25:00.000Z	ikonia_	Anubi1	because the repos are compatable and they track dependencies
2007-02-23T06:26:00.000Z	ikonia_	Anubi1	I've juggested to you about 10 times now - use the repos
2007-02-23T06:27:00.000Z	ikonia_	Anubi1	you select which one you want
2007-02-23T06:27:00.000Z	ikonia_	Anubi1	and you will get one thats compatible with ubuntu
2007-02-23T06:28:00.000Z	ikonia_	Anubi1	you're not listening - so you may as well stop asking
