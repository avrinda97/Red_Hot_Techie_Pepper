2009-02-05T09:33:00.000Z	root		root here
2009-02-05T09:33:00.000Z	root		I was wondering
2009-02-05T09:33:00.000Z	root		In "keyboard shortcuts"
2009-02-05T09:34:00.000Z	root		I can bind switch to workspace 1 and 2
2009-02-05T09:34:00.000Z	root		So
2009-02-05T09:34:00.000Z	root		in "keyboard shortcuts", I see the fields to allow binding to switch to workspaces 1 and 2, but there are no fields for Workspaces 3 and 4
2009-02-05T09:34:00.000Z	root		where can I program those shortcuts :D
2009-02-05T09:36:00.000Z	Sylphid	root	add workspace 3 and 4 to your workspace switcher and they will be added to your keyboard shortcut menu
2009-02-05T09:36:00.000Z	root	Sylphid	Let's see if you're right
2009-02-05T09:36:00.000Z	root	Sylphid	You're right! Thanks
2009-02-05T09:37:00.000Z	Sylphid	root	np
2009-02-05T09:37:00.000Z	root	Sylphid	another question my friend
2009-02-05T09:38:00.000Z	root	Sylphid	When I try to use irssi under my regular account, I encounter this error while /server irc.freenode.net'ing: 20:37 -!- Irssi: Unable to connect server irc.freenode.net port 6667 [Cannot  assign requested address: 208.113.233.166]
2009-02-05T09:38:00.000Z	root	Sylphid	any idea on how I can get that working?
2009-02-05T09:39:00.000Z	Sylphid	root	1 sec ... got an idea
2009-02-05T09:39:00.000Z	root	Sylphid	holding :)
2009-02-05T09:43:00.000Z	root	Sylphid	anything coming to you?
2009-02-05T09:43:00.000Z	Sylphid	root	not very familiar with irssi but try using port 8001 instead of 6667
