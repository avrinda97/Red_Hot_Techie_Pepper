2007-03-17T16:02:00.000Z	beast_		please does anyone have java6?
2007-03-17T16:03:00.000Z	jrib	beast_	ask your real question
2007-03-17T16:04:00.000Z	jrib	beast_	use sun-java6-jre from edgy-backports
2007-03-17T16:05:00.000Z	beast_	jrib	i have dapper and would it be alright to get it from synaptic?
2007-03-17T16:05:00.000Z	jrib	beast_	java6 is not packaged for dapper
2007-03-17T16:06:00.000Z	beast_	jrib	i see it here in synaptic
2007-03-17T16:07:00.000Z	jrib	beast_	ok then install it, but to quell my curiousity can you show me the output of this command:  apt-cache policy sun-java6-jre
2007-03-17T16:08:00.000Z	beast_	jrib	sun-java6-jre:
2007-03-17T16:08:00.000Z	jrib	beast_	thanks, that should be ok.  In the future please use a pastebin for large pastes
2007-03-17T16:09:00.000Z	beast_	jrib	just the jdk and bin should be ok right?
2007-03-17T16:10:00.000Z	jrib	beast_	yes, unless you also want the plugin for firefox
2007-03-17T16:14:00.000Z	beast_	jrib	i installed it but the java commands in the terminal don't work
2007-03-17T16:14:00.000Z	jrib	beast_	what java commands?  WHat errors do you get?
2007-03-17T16:14:00.000Z	jrib	beast_	details are important :)
2007-03-17T16:15:00.000Z	beast_	jrib	java -version and the error is bash:java:command not found
2007-03-17T16:16:00.000Z	jrib	beast_	join me in #ubuntu-classroom
2007-03-17T16:43:00.000Z	beast_	jrib	i found the problem. The eclipse version in the repos is a bit old and isn't compatible with java 6. I downloaded  1.5 and changed the default and it works perfect :D
2007-03-17T16:43:00.000Z	jrib	beast_	ah, great
