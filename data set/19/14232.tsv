2004-10-15T12:06:00.000Z	mjr		hmm, couldn't find a definitive statement either from dri.sf.net or HardwareSupport Wiki, so does anyone know if Radeon 9250 has free 3d support (one would guess that it does, since it's apparently not that different from 9200, which does, but I don't like to guess)?
2004-10-15T12:07:00.000Z	topyli	mjr	ubuntu has some ati and nvidia non-free drivers included
2004-10-15T12:08:00.000Z	mjr	topyli	indeed, but I'm going to buy me some hardware and there's a principle involved
2004-10-15T12:08:00.000Z	topyli	mjr	always get matrox cards, is what i say :)
2004-10-15T12:08:00.000Z	mjr	topyli	they've gone evil nowadays too, so...
2004-10-15T12:09:00.000Z	topyli	mjr	most disturbing. what exactly have they done?
2004-10-15T12:10:00.000Z	mjr	topyli	what with the proprietary driver bullshit at least for parhelia
2004-10-15T12:10:00.000Z	topyli	mjr	well they had that for a while for the g550 as well, but integrated it in x later. much better than others
2004-11-05T16:17:00.000Z	topyli	mjr	your idea is better :)
2005-04-16T10:38:00.000Z	mjr	topyli	and they want to screw us over by instituting EU software patents
2005-04-16T10:38:00.000Z	topyli	mjr	sure. they would benefit
2005-04-16T10:39:00.000Z	topyli	mjr	yes. still waiting for others to make a device to match the communicator though :(
2005-04-24T13:38:00.000Z	topyli	mjr	how much money do you have behind your pribes program so far? :)
2005-08-26T07:02:00.000Z	mjr	topyli	only?
2005-08-26T07:02:00.000Z	topyli	mjr	seems pretty cool: http://www.go-l.com/monitors/athens/features/index.htm
2005-08-26T07:02:00.000Z	mjr	topyli	not bad, not bad
2005-08-26T07:03:00.000Z	topyli	mjr	i wonder how much those cost
2005-08-26T07:03:00.000Z	topyli	mjr	i might have to upgrade my matrox G550 card too :)
2005-09-05T14:47:00.000Z	topyli	mjr	true enough
