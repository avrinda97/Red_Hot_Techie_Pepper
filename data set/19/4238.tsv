2009-02-25T03:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	PotterT|VF	vinagre - VNC client for the GNOME Desktop
2009-02-25T03:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	PotterT|VF	its not default though
2009-02-25T03:32:00.000Z	PotterT|VF		yes ActionParsnip, thats what i asked for
2009-02-25T03:32:00.000Z	PotterT|VF	ActionParsnip	its installed from the livecd, thats default enough for me
2009-02-25T03:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	PotterT|VF	any vnc client is optionally installed
2009-02-25T03:32:00.000Z	PotterT|VF		you sure?
2009-02-25T03:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	PotterT|VF	why not try one that suits your needs rather being "the default"
2009-02-25T03:32:00.000Z	PotterT|VF		eh, doesn't matter, my question is answered
2009-02-25T03:33:00.000Z	PotterT|VF	ActionParsnip	i'm not trying one, i wanted to remember the name of the program that i know works, i'm at work which runs fedora, and wanted to install it
