2008-04-22T00:25:00.000Z	chicos	h00k	until the Dell Bios screws you over\
2008-04-22T00:26:00.000Z	h00k	chicos	what do you mean?
2008-04-22T00:27:00.000Z	chicos	h00k	The Dell Bios Thing has auto, but that doesn't seem to fix the problem.
2008-04-22T00:28:00.000Z	h00k	chicos	have you moved your partitions?
2008-04-22T00:28:00.000Z	h00k	chicos	That can happen if your hdd is bad, also.
2008-04-22T00:29:00.000Z	chicos	h00k	No, the particians are the same
2008-04-22T00:29:00.000Z	h00k	chicos	it won't boot off the LiveCD?
2008-04-22T00:29:00.000Z	chicos	h00k	No, it just hangs. even off of edgy
2008-04-22T00:30:00.000Z	h00k	chicos	Where does it hang when you try to boot the CD?
2008-04-22T00:31:00.000Z	h00k	chicos	and you're boot order is set correctly?
2008-04-22T00:31:00.000Z	chicos	h00k	The menu, I select "Startr or install Ubuntu", and then the screen goes blank, and the CDRom slows down after about a minute
2008-04-22T00:31:00.000Z	chicos	h00k	It worked before.
2008-04-22T00:31:00.000Z	h00k	chicos	it's possible you have some bad hardware
2008-04-22T00:32:00.000Z	chicos	h00k	I'm going to install the Hdd into another comp as a slave.
2008-04-22T00:45:00.000Z	h00k	chicos	it was HDD?
