2006-11-24T13:41:00.000Z	Jager-		Im planning on moving all my non-game apps over to linux once i get it installed, and just use windows for games. so after i uninstall all the apps i can use on linux (or open source equivalents) will i be able to reduce the size of the windows partition and give it to linux?
2006-11-24T13:42:00.000Z	Jager-		and vice-verse (in case i need more room on the windows partition)
2006-11-24T13:42:00.000Z	H3g3m0n	Jager-	Yes, you can use gparted on the live cd to resize them
2006-11-24T13:51:00.000Z	Jager-	H3g3m0n	How can I go about creating a 10gb partition for linux? It doesnt seem to work in Gpart
2006-11-24T13:52:00.000Z	H3g3m0n	Jager-	Do you have the space free?
2006-11-24T13:53:00.000Z	H3g3m0n	Jager-	Try cfdisk if gparted isn't working, you will also need to mkfs.ext3 the partition you make in cfdisk though
2006-11-24T13:53:00.000Z	H3g3m0n	Jager-	Yep
2006-11-24T13:54:00.000Z	H3g3m0n	Jager-	If your installing ubuntu then the installer will probally beable to allocate the space to the largest free region on your hdd
2006-11-24T13:54:00.000Z	Jager-	H3g3m0n	so what option should I chose
2006-11-24T13:55:00.000Z	H3g3m0n	Jager-	In the installer for using free region or cfdisk for making a new parition?
2006-11-24T13:55:00.000Z	Jager-	H3g3m0n	the installer
2006-11-24T13:56:00.000Z	Jager-	H3g3m0n	whenever I chose "resize (hdd name) and use freed space" it wont let me resize it
2006-11-24T13:57:00.000Z	H3g3m0n	Jager-	When you say you have free space, is it free space on a windows/other partition or unpartitioned space?
2006-11-24T13:58:00.000Z	H3g3m0n	Jager-	Ah ok, try shrinking the windows partition down manually first in gparted, if it doesn't work check the error in the details section
2006-11-24T13:59:00.000Z	H3g3m0n	Jager-	What the error is giving you?
2006-11-24T14:00:00.000Z	H3g3m0n	Jager-	"ERROR: Extended record needed (1048 > 1024), not yet supported! Please try to free less space."
2006-11-24T14:00:00.000Z	Jager-	H3g3m0n	(Thats an older log, but all Ive done after this is change the size I tried changing the windows partition to)
2006-11-24T14:00:00.000Z	H3g3m0n	Jager-	just don't try to free that much space, try a smaller number
