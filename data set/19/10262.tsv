2006-07-05T16:05:00.000Z	Saais		I have a question about gateways. How I have my default gateway setup to be eth0 which is directly connected, but I am also connected to a router via wireless. I was wondering how would I connect to a machine my on 192.168.2.* range without switching the gateway from eth0.
2006-07-05T16:06:00.000Z	wastrel	Saais	 if there is a network interface on the 192.168.2 network, traffic should go there, rather than the gateway
2006-07-05T16:07:00.000Z	Saais	wastrel	I tried going to the router's IP address in my browser (192.168.2.1) and it just sat there loading for quite some time and still nothing happened.
2006-07-05T16:07:00.000Z	wastrel	Saais	 can you ping the router?
2006-07-05T16:07:00.000Z	Saais	wastrel	there is no responses
2006-07-05T16:09:00.000Z	wastrel	Saais	 and iwconfig shows you're connected to the proper wireless network?
2006-07-05T16:09:00.000Z	Saais	wastrel	yes, i am connected with full signal and have an ip assigned to my interface.
2006-07-05T16:10:00.000Z	wastrel	Saais	 what does the routing table look like?  try   route   there should be a line for each interface and a line for the default gateway
2006-07-05T16:11:00.000Z	wastrel	Saais	 i'd first try taking the wireless interface down, and bringing it back up again.
2006-07-05T16:11:00.000Z	wastrel	Saais	 how do you normally do that?
2006-07-05T16:11:00.000Z	Saais	wastrel	do what? get on my router?
2006-07-05T16:12:00.000Z	wastrel	Saais	 enable your wireless connection
2006-07-05T16:12:00.000Z	Saais	wastrel	it is, but ill bring it down and back up just to check
2006-07-05T16:13:00.000Z	wastrel	Saais	 i meant how do you enable your wireless connection :] 
2006-07-05T16:13:00.000Z	Saais	wastrel	i use networking program under system
2006-07-05T16:14:00.000Z	wastrel	Saais	 k  and after 'refreshing' the wireless connection, do you have a route for the local network 192.168.2.* ?
2006-07-05T16:15:00.000Z	Saais	wastrel	one moment
2006-07-05T16:19:00.000Z	Saais	wastrel	yes i do have route entries
