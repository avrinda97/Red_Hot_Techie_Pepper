2008-12-21T05:12:00.000Z	Zerocool947		I just installed a package from synaptic that's supposed to give me utilities for my laptop, but I don't know how to access it or modify it
2008-12-21T05:14:00.000Z	anto9us	Zerocool947	read your package's information provided in synaptic
2008-12-21T05:15:00.000Z	Zerocool947	anto9us	I did, it didn't provide anything. Also, I restarted and i don't remember what the package is called
2008-12-21T05:16:00.000Z	anto9us	Zerocool947	then, retrace your steps, what were you looking for and why? All packages have a list of installed files.
2008-12-21T05:16:00.000Z	Zerocool947	anto9us	it was a set of utilities for dell laptops
2008-12-21T05:17:00.000Z	Zerocool947	anto9us	I found it in the terminal, then downloaded it through synaptic
2008-12-21T05:18:00.000Z	anto9us	Zerocool947	so, what do you need help with? Synaptic includes a list of files that each package will install.
2008-12-21T05:19:00.000Z	Zerocool947	anto9us	well first I need to find the package. Then I need to find what it installed exactly and how I activate it
2008-12-21T05:20:00.000Z	anto9us	Zerocool947	in terminal, pressing up arrow will step you back through your history of typed commands
2008-12-21T05:20:00.000Z	Zerocool947	anto9us	I found it in synaptic, but I can't find where It would have installed the program
2008-12-21T05:21:00.000Z	anto9us	Zerocool947	it may have been a number of programs, look at its file list, it may have put some in /usr/bin or similar
2008-12-21T05:42:00.000Z	Zerocool947	anto9us	Theres a bunch of files, but I don't know if they're automatically implemented
2008-12-21T05:42:00.000Z	Zerocool947	anto9us	and I don't really know what to do with any of them
2008-12-21T05:44:00.000Z	anto9us	Zerocool947	you should do some research through your favourite search engine, not everything comes with the documentation you can easily digest, a certain skill level might be required
2008-12-21T05:49:00.000Z	Zerocool947	anto9us	Sorry to keep bothering you, but I think I have a grasp at what I have to do. The ReadMe is telling me to make a daemon that starts at boot by creating an init file
2008-12-21T05:50:00.000Z	Zerocool947	anto9us	and gives me the few things that I have to set, but I don't know how to do it. Do yo uthink you could help me?
2008-12-21T05:52:00.000Z	anto9us	Zerocool947	I'm off to bed soon, you should do some research through your favourite search engine is my advice
2008-12-21T05:54:00.000Z	anto9us	Zerocool947	you should check that the init files haven't already been created for you, look in /etc/init.d
2008-12-21T05:55:00.000Z	Zerocool947	anto9us	thank you for pointing me in the right direction. The readme says I have to create them, I have some basic (read: very basic) programming experience, so might be able to do something
