2008-07-08T19:12:00.000Z	Tita1		The one I saw wasn't on Ubuntu forums
2008-07-08T19:13:00.000Z	Tita1		And I cant run software, I downloaded some Linux drivers, and I extracted the folder, I CD'd to the folder, and I ran the makefile and got some stupid error
2008-07-08T19:14:00.000Z	Tita1		Not really,I understood Windows when I was like 5 years old
2008-07-08T19:15:00.000Z	Tita1		what?
2008-07-08T19:15:00.000Z	Tita1		Um actualy, read what Im saying. WoW is a small part of it
2008-07-08T19:16:00.000Z	Tita1		Im having a difficult time doing anything.
2008-07-08T19:16:00.000Z	Tita1		And yes, I played games when i was 5
2008-07-08T19:17:00.000Z	Tita1		I do, I that feeling of when you finaly get the syntax right, and everything works.But the thing is, I can never get it right with Ubuntu
2008-07-08T19:17:00.000Z	Tita1		Thats not all I care about
2008-07-08T19:17:00.000Z	Chousuke	Tita1	you're not trying hard enough
2008-07-08T19:18:00.000Z	Chousuke	Tita1	then Linux is probably not for you
2008-07-08T19:18:00.000Z	Chousuke	Tita1	you have to buy hardware with Linux in mind if you want to use Linux
2008-07-08T19:18:00.000Z	Chousuke	Tita1	otherwise, it's up to luck
2008-07-08T19:21:00.000Z	Chousuke	Tita1	you're trying to compile an application? that's for advanced users, really.
2008-07-08T19:22:00.000Z	Chousuke	Tita1	you're trying to do something you probably wouldn't know how on windows, either :/
2008-07-08T19:23:00.000Z	Chousuke	Tita1	an average person doesn't compile software on windows.
2008-07-08T19:23:00.000Z	Chousuke	Tita1	neither do most "nerds"
2008-07-08T19:23:00.000Z	Chousuke	Tita1	install them from the package management.
