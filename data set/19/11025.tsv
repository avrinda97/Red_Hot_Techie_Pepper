2006-04-05T15:23:00.000Z	irad		i got that instructure from HOWTO in ubuntu: "3)the default gcc compiler needs to match the one used by the kernel (gcc-3.4 in my case)" so my question is: how do i know what gcc compiler i need to use if i am using kernel 2.6.12-10-386?
2006-04-05T15:24:00.000Z	razzmatazz	irad	type 'dmesg | grep gcc'
2006-04-05T15:27:00.000Z	irad		[4294667.296000]  Linux version 2.6.12-10-386 (buildd@terranova) (gcc version 3.4.5 20050809 (prerelease) (Ubuntu 3.4.4-6ubuntu8.1)) #1 Sat Mar 11 16:13:17 UTC 2006
2006-04-05T15:27:00.000Z	irad		is it okay?
2006-04-05T15:28:00.000Z	irad	razzmatazz	what does this output need to give me?
2006-04-05T15:28:00.000Z	razzmatazz	irad	so, it's abvious, your kernel was compiled with gcc 3.4.5
2006-04-05T15:29:00.000Z	razzmatazz		and the version of gcc you have installed can be retrieved with 'gcc --version'
2006-04-05T15:29:00.000Z	irad	razzmatazz	so i don't need to download any other gcc?
2006-04-05T15:29:00.000Z	irad	razzmatazz	or i need that one to compile whatever i need to compile with it?
2006-04-05T15:30:00.000Z	razzmatazz	irad	if 'gcc --version' matches that metioned in 'dmesg | grep gcc', then yep, you won't need another one
2006-04-05T15:30:00.000Z	irad		aight
2006-04-05T15:30:00.000Z	irad		gcc (GCC) 4.0.2 20050808 (prerelease) (Ubuntu 4.0.1-4ubuntu9)

2006-04-05T15:30:00.000Z	irad	razzmatazz	is it okay or i need to downgrade?
2006-04-05T15:32:00.000Z	razzmatazz	irad	i don't know what you're trying to do
2006-04-05T15:32:00.000Z	razzmatazz	irad	if you need to build kernel module, than you'll either have to upgrade your kernel, or downgrade the compiler, or install alternative one
2006-04-05T15:33:00.000Z	irad	razzmatazz	i am trying to install nvidia driver, and i am abit afraid, can you help me?
