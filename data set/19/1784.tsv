2010-10-10T02:53:00.000Z	Tongas		er, I looked up and saw your tangas thing, very funny ;p it (it's hard to read using this webchat thing). ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh $ that makes much more sense, yes, I have a C$ right there
2010-10-10T02:54:00.000Z	Tongas		haha, poor windows, nobody likes it
2010-10-10T02:55:00.000Z	Tongas		but, uh, wait.. I shared my C drive and, uh, I have three folders, ADMIN$, barboza (the name of the original admin), and C$
2010-10-10T02:56:00.000Z	Tongas		I get into barboza and I see the contents of C but I can't change anything
2010-10-10T02:56:00.000Z	Tongas		sorry if you have to repeat yourself but this webchat is terrible, I see half the things you say and I have to search the whole thing to try and find the rest
2010-10-10T02:57:00.000Z	Tongas		wait, ok, I'll unshare it, but
2010-10-10T02:57:00.000Z	Tongas		somethign has to be shared, hah =p
2010-10-10T02:58:00.000Z	Tongas		thank you Ken8521 =)
2010-10-10T02:58:00.000Z	Ken8521	Tongas	assuming someone has set up their client, it also highlights/alerts the person you're talking to.
2010-10-10T02:58:00.000Z	Ken8521	Tongas	which really helps in a crowded channel
2010-10-10T02:59:00.000Z	Tongas	Ken8521	:) I see that now. thanks a lot :)
2010-10-10T02:59:00.000Z	Ken8521	Tongas	np :)

2010-10-10T05:38:00.000Z	Ken8521	Tongas	so you can view and manipulate that PC, while on your PC
2010-10-10T05:48:00.000Z	Ken8521	Tongas	sorry, i don't do samba.. i thought your question was about vnc/remote desktop
2010-10-10T05:48:00.000Z	Tongas	Ken8521	ahh, alright, thanks =p
2010-10-10T05:50:00.000Z	Ken8521	Tongas	thats an enthusiast in the making
2010-10-10T05:52:00.000Z	Ken8521	Tongas	i would if i were you, you'll find after a couple of months, Ubuntu/Linux is just as easy as Windows, it's just different, and you have to learn it all oer again
2010-10-10T05:54:00.000Z	Tongas	Ken8521	heh, right, but my family shuns me for trying it though, so, I'm deciding =p
