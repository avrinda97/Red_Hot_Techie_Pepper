2008-03-13T05:58:00.000Z	damaltor	kholerabbi	put an index.htm into the folder =)
2008-03-13T05:58:00.000Z	kholerabbi	damaltor	sorry :)?
2008-03-13T05:59:00.000Z	kholerabbi	damaltor	I am not understanding?
2008-03-13T05:59:00.000Z	damaltor	kholerabbi	if there is an index.htm in the folder, it will be displayed instead of the folder itself. so make a file named "index.htm" and put it into the directory
2008-03-13T06:00:00.000Z	kholerabbi	damaltor	sure, but what is this about, is it something to do with my wired connection not working?
2008-03-13T06:01:00.000Z	damaltor	kholerabbi	no i dont think so. if apache displays a folder, it doesnt have anything elso to display. thats all.
2008-03-13T06:02:00.000Z	kholerabbi	damaltor	hmmm.. right. interesting .. but I  haven't been talking about apache, maybe it was someone else :p
2008-03-13T06:02:00.000Z	damaltor	kholerabbi	oh, sorry. must have been a mistake... so what was ypur problem then? ;)
2008-03-13T06:03:00.000Z	kholerabbi	damaltor	haha nah, I'm having a problem with 7.10 not working with my wired internet connection (it just says it's connected but I can't us it) :(
2008-03-13T06:03:00.000Z	damaltor	kholerabbi	type "route" and pastebin it, please
2008-03-13T06:05:00.000Z	kholerabbi	damaltor	won't help, I'm not using 7.10 at the mo'
2008-03-13T06:05:00.000Z	damaltor	kholerabbi	oh. so where do you see that it is connected?
2008-03-13T06:06:00.000Z	kholerabbi	damaltor	well heres the story: I put in the 7.10 livecd, it says it connecting at the icon in the tray, then it is connected, but still not working in firefox or anything else -
2008-03-13T06:07:00.000Z	kholerabbi	damaltor	works fine in feisty
2008-03-13T06:07:00.000Z	damaltor	kholerabbi	nice. =) sometimes it helps, if you kill that nasty tray icon (didnt work for me either) and then type "dhclient eth0" on console.
2008-03-13T06:07:00.000Z	kholerabbi	damaltor	really and that works?
2008-03-13T06:08:00.000Z	damaltor	kholerabbi	well, it worked for me, and the tray icon didnt. so it is worth a try while you cannot brake anything in a live distro =)
2008-03-13T06:08:00.000Z	kholerabbi	damaltor	haha true I have to go and I will try it cheers mate :)
2008-03-13T06:09:00.000Z	damaltor	kholerabbi	have fun =)
