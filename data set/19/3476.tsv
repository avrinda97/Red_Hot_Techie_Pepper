2009-09-12T18:23:00.000Z	Ayla		hello
2009-09-12T18:24:00.000Z	Ayla		I've got a problem, my session does not want to start
2009-09-12T18:24:00.000Z	Ayla		nautilus segfaults :/
2009-09-12T18:25:00.000Z	Ayla		yesterday, everything was okay
2009-09-12T18:25:00.000Z	stefg	Ayla	did you install a custom theme?
2009-09-12T18:44:00.000Z	stefg	Ayla	ext4 filesystem and some unexpected shutdown (power loss)?
2009-09-12T18:45:00.000Z	Ayla	stefg	ext4 filesystem, and no unexpected shutdown at least none as I'm aware of
2009-09-12T18:45:00.000Z	stefg	Ayla	have you done a fsck already?
2009-09-12T18:46:00.000Z	Ayla	stefg	everytime the computer starts
2009-09-12T18:49:00.000Z	stefg	Ayla	so it might well be a corrupt file... twright is right. fsck will only fix metadata for a broken file (which won't help). If some lib went belly up.... good luck in finding which one.
2009-09-12T18:50:00.000Z	Ayla	stefg	is there a command that reinstall every already-installed package ?
2009-09-12T18:51:00.000Z	stefg	Ayla	apt-get install --reinstall ... but i don't know if it has some sort of -all switch
2009-09-12T18:53:00.000Z	Ayla	stefg	is ext4 the source of the problem ?
2009-09-12T18:53:00.000Z	stefg	Ayla	that's just a guess
2009-09-12T18:54:00.000Z	Ayla	stefg	if I reinstall, should I use ext3 then ?
2009-09-12T18:55:00.000Z	stefg	Ayla	have you run a memtest? can also be a bad strip of ram...
2009-09-12T18:56:00.000Z	Ayla	stefg	memtest ? is that a program ? I can't find it
2009-09-12T18:57:00.000Z	stefg	Ayla	that's an option during boot (if you 'esc' to the boot menu)... it's a test program for the system ram
2009-09-12T18:58:00.000Z	Ayla	stefg	ok, I'll try this, thanks
