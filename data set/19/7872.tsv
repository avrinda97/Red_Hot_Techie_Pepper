2007-06-10T06:47:00.000Z	Pelo	moofs	 I assume that you have a seperate / partiton for each release ?
2007-06-10T06:44:00.000Z	Pelo	moofs	 do you have a specific issue ?
2007-06-10T06:45:00.000Z	moofs	Pelo	yes, well...after installing both 6.06 and 7.04 the system freezes when trying to boot...
2007-06-10T06:45:00.000Z	moofs	Pelo	"Uncompressing Linux... Ok, booting the kernel"   <--- it freezes here
2007-06-10T06:46:00.000Z	Pelo	moofs	 you upgraded to 7.04 ?  try a clean install instead,
2007-06-10T06:46:00.000Z	moofs	Pelo	I did a clean install with both
2007-06-10T06:46:00.000Z	moofs	Pelo	its on a Dell 600m

2007-06-10T06:47:00.000Z	moofs	Pelo	so I dont care whats on it

2007-06-10T06:48:00.000Z	moofs	Pelo	1.4 Pentium M, 512mb RAM, 40gb HD, Radeon 9000
2007-06-10T06:49:00.000Z	Pelo	moofs	  the problem maybe iwth the ati video card,  did you install with the live cd or the alternate install ,  actualy were you able to install at all ?
2007-06-10T06:50:00.000Z	moofs	Pelo	yes the install completed
2007-06-10T06:50:00.000Z	Pelo	moofs	I don'T know then,  can you boot the recovery mode ?

2007-06-10T06:51:00.000Z	Pelo	moofs	then I don'T have a clue,  try looking up the computer model in the forum, maybe someone else had the same issue and figured out a fix
2007-06-10T06:52:00.000Z	moofs	Pelo	Am I right in thinking the alternative is Ubuntu 6.06 LTS?
2007-06-10T06:52:00.000Z	Pelo	moofs	no  the alternate cd says alternate,  there is one for each release for each architecture
