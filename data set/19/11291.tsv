2010-08-20T19:06:00.000Z	ectospasm	Magnetro	WINE in my experience only works for very simple programs

2010-08-20T19:07:00.000Z	ectospasm	Magnetro	... .Net on Linux/UNIX
2010-08-20T19:09:00.000Z	ectospasm	Magnetro	http://www.mono-project.com/Main_Page
2010-08-20T19:09:00.000Z	ectospasm	Magnetro	did you try the "unzip" CLI program?
