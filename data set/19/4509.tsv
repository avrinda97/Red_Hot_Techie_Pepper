2009-02-20T13:49:00.000Z	packetloss		well is there a way i could mount these partitions ?
2009-02-20T13:50:00.000Z	werLd	packetloss	what are you trying to mount
2009-02-20T13:53:00.000Z	werLd	packetloss	looks like a bunch of linux partitions
2009-02-20T13:54:00.000Z	werLd	packetloss	mount -t ext3 /dev/hda3 /wherever why not this command?
2009-02-20T13:55:00.000Z	werLd	packetloss	have you formated the partitions yet? do they have a filesystem on them?
2009-02-20T13:55:00.000Z	werLd	packetloss	mkfs.ext3
2009-02-20T13:59:00.000Z	werLd	packetloss	msg me the mount output and df -h output
2009-02-20T14:08:00.000Z	werLd	packetloss	maybe those arent ext3
2009-02-20T14:09:00.000Z	werLd	packetloss	what will raid 1 do for you
2009-02-20T14:11:00.000Z	werLd	packetloss	id have to dig into raid, but it sounds like those partitions arent doing you much good
2009-02-20T14:11:00.000Z	werLd	packetloss	I am not raid guru tho, but i have a feeling if you formated using mkfs.ext3 you would be able to mount them
2009-02-20T14:11:00.000Z	werLd	packetloss	did you try mount force option?
2009-02-20T14:12:00.000Z	werLd	packetloss	are you sure these are ext3 filesystems?
2009-02-20T14:13:00.000Z	werLd	packetloss	what are you trying to achieve? i mean, your running linux, and it looks like you have some of your partitions mounted, so the other ones are just sitting there, what are you afraid of losing ?
2009-02-20T14:14:00.000Z	packetloss	werLd	there is a database full of documents somewhere on this drive
2009-02-20T14:15:00.000Z	werLd	packetloss	but not on any of the partitions currently mounted?
2009-02-20T14:15:00.000Z	werLd	packetloss	do you know how to priv msg?
2009-02-20T14:16:00.000Z	werLd	packetloss	send me your fdisk results, along with df -h along with mount
