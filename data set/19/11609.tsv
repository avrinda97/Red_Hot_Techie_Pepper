2007-07-09T12:29:00.000Z	kane77		are intel graphic cards and intel wifi cards well supported? I'm planning to buy laptop...
2007-07-09T12:29:00.000Z	Anlar	kane77	intel is the BEST supported
2007-07-09T12:29:00.000Z	Anlar	kane77	just stellar out of the box
2007-07-09T12:29:00.000Z	kane77	Anlar	whew cool! I buy intel then :)
2007-07-09T12:30:00.000Z	Anlar	kane77	if the hardware is 100% intel all the way, you don't have to worry about that question.. just slap in any alternative os and it will usually just work
2007-07-09T12:30:00.000Z	Anlar	kane77	including the display adapter.. I'd be slightly picky if I was you though, gma950 is aok but you might want to squeeze in gma3000
2007-07-09T12:32:00.000Z	kane77	Anlar	so you advise intel over AMD, eh? but the sempron laptop has 6-cell battery, the intel laptop has 4-cell :(
2007-07-09T12:33:00.000Z	Anlar	kane77	it's not the cpu. intel has the luxury to combine intel cpu with intel chipsets.. which makes wonders. amd can not offer that ever
2007-07-09T12:36:00.000Z	kane77	Anlar	hmm.. i want a cheap laptop that needs to last as long as possible, I don't need it to be too fast..
2007-07-09T12:38:00.000Z	Anlar	kane77	hp nx 6400 series for instance. or, fujitsu-siemens amilo pro vx3000 series if you want small. or, asus ones.. they come with better warranties
2007-07-09T12:38:00.000Z	Anlar	kane77	or, system76 or was it 67 or 79 or whatever.. :p
2007-07-09T12:39:00.000Z	kane77	Anlar	hp seemed good to me, plus a friend bought one and didn't have any problems in ubuntu...
2007-07-09T12:40:00.000Z	Anlar	kane77	yes, most of the business series hps are intel all the way. they are the old "compaq" series and they have actually supported linux for some customers from 2001 or so
2007-07-09T12:45:00.000Z	kane77	Anlar	what diffrence does 4-cell/6-cell battery make?
2007-07-09T12:45:00.000Z	Anlar	kane77	45 minutes?
2007-07-09T12:45:00.000Z	kane77	Anlar	only that little? :/
2007-07-09T12:45:00.000Z	kane77	Anlar	I thought it was more...
2007-07-09T12:45:00.000Z	Anlar	kane77	don't worry about that. :)
