2005-07-14T15:21:00.000Z	newbie		i am on the samba site now all i found so far is for lan
2005-07-14T15:21:00.000Z	newbie		thanx guys
2005-07-14T11:16:00.000Z	newbie		hello. i tried installing Ubuntu into my laptop which has winxp pro, but i've run into problems. i followed the instructions in: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WindowsDualBootHowTo
2005-07-14T11:18:00.000Z	newbie		everything installed fine, then when it rebooted to complete ubuntu installation i just had a blank screen that read: missing operating system
2005-07-14T11:20:00.000Z	newbie		i thought it had to do with the partitioning
2005-07-14T11:21:00.000Z	newbie		i was still able to undo everything, so it's not a disaster problem
2005-07-14T11:21:00.000Z	newbie		but i'm trying to figure out how to do it right... i really want to install linux
2005-07-14T11:22:00.000Z	reka	newbie	so you know what went wrong?
2005-07-14T11:17:00.000Z	reka	newbie	what problems?
2005-07-14T11:20:00.000Z	reka	newbie	sounds like you messed up your partitioning
2005-07-14T11:24:00.000Z	reka	newbie	sounds OK
2005-07-14T11:26:00.000Z	reka	newbie	i'd reinstall, deleting the ext2 and swap paritions, then auto partition the free space.  leave everything it sets as default from there (i.e. which to make bootable)  and say yes when it asks to install grub to the MBR.
2005-07-14T11:29:00.000Z	reka	newbie	you said you now have: [1] NTFS winxp [2]  linux ext2 [3]  swap [4]  fat32
2005-07-14T11:29:00.000Z	reka	newbie	delete [2]  and [3] 
2005-07-14T11:29:00.000Z	reka	newbie	that will create some free space
2005-07-14T11:29:00.000Z	reka	newbie	then highlight the free space and select auto-partition
2005-07-14T11:30:00.000Z	reka	newbie	then leave every other setting as default
2005-07-14T11:34:00.000Z	reka	newbie	install windows first then
2005-07-14T11:35:00.000Z	reka	newbie	leave some free space, then just use that to install ubuntu to when you run the ubuntu install
