2008-09-20T15:21:00.000Z	The_ManU_212		hi i made a update with adept-manager (icon in kicker) it crashed with sig11 after installing all before getting the message that all was installed sucessfully (there is a small progress abr, it loads  often a window when there is a new kubuntu version to upgrade), there it crashed
2008-09-20T15:21:00.000Z	The_ManU_212		how to find out if the system is ok? is this bad?
2008-09-20T15:21:00.000Z	Seveas	The_ManU_212	hmm, that doesn't look too healthy. Can you still open up a konsole?
2008-09-20T15:22:00.000Z	The_ManU_212	Seveas	yep, i use standard ubuntu sources and wine nothing else
2008-09-20T15:23:00.000Z	Seveas	The_ManU_212	ok, then you can run these commands (in this order) to restore some sanity. Pastebin all output please so I can see how bad it is.
2008-09-20T15:26:00.000Z	The_ManU_212	Seveas	sudo dpkg --configure -a -> new prompt, sudo apt-get -f install, install remove and upgrade all 0 then prompt, sudo apt-get dist-upgrade -> nothing to upgrade /same as -f install
2008-09-20T15:26:00.000Z	Seveas	The_ManU_212	then all is fine :)
2008-09-20T15:27:00.000Z	Seveas	The_ManU_212	just to be sure, run this: sudo update-initramfs -u so your initramfs is definitely ok
2008-09-20T15:27:00.000Z	The_ManU_212	Seveas	ok and then my system is 100% ok?
2008-09-20T15:27:00.000Z	Seveas	The_ManU_212	yes
2008-09-20T15:28:00.000Z	The_ManU_212	Seveas	is it more secure to run sudo apt-get dist-upgrade then the adept-manager?
2008-09-20T15:28:00.000Z	Seveas	The_ManU_212	doesn't matter much, but this was easier for me to explain as I don't know adept-manager :)
2008-09-20T15:29:00.000Z	The_ManU_212	Seveas	it is a frontend for kde
2008-09-20T15:29:00.000Z	Seveas	The_ManU_212	yes, I know that much :) I don't use kde
2008-09-20T15:30:00.000Z	The_ManU_212	Seveas	ok to get more experience in using a terminal, how to update thes system without using a frontend (which steps) and is there a differnce between updating the system and upgrading to a new distro?
2008-09-20T15:31:00.000Z	Seveas	The_ManU_212	updating to a newer version of ubuntu just means updating more packages :)
2008-09-20T15:53:00.000Z	The_ManU_212	Seveas	thx for your help
2008-09-20T16:03:00.000Z	The_ManU_212	Seveas	as i see i ran the -f install command before reconfiguring anything, is that bad?
2008-09-20T16:13:00.000Z	The_ManU_212	Seveas	still here?
