2006-09-28T05:45:00.000Z	Emperor_Norton		There's um...d00m3, a few games by blizzard, and Wesnoth
2006-09-28T05:47:00.000Z	Emperor_Norton		Ignite: Erm....there aren't a *whole* lot of native linux games.
2006-09-28T05:47:00.000Z	Emperor_Norton		that aren't variations on ROGUE
2006-09-28T05:47:00.000Z	Emperor_Norton		or Nethack
2006-09-28T05:48:00.000Z	ProN00b	Emperor_Norton	and even less if you add good of to the list of attributes
2006-09-28T05:50:00.000Z	ProN00b	Emperor_Norton	blizzard gives a shit about linux
2006-09-28T05:50:00.000Z	ProN00b	Emperor_Norton	you could prolly run the mac wow on linux with a few small hacks, but they don't do it
2006-09-28T05:57:00.000Z	ProN00b	Emperor_Norton	it isn't all that hard if you look at it more closely, look at how many games are made with the quake or ut engines... now look at it how many of them come with a linux binary...
2006-09-28T05:57:00.000Z	ProN00b	Emperor_Norton	people just don't care
2006-09-28T05:57:00.000Z	Emperor_Norton	ProN00b	There will be a bigger market for linux games in the (relatively) near future
2006-09-28T05:58:00.000Z	ProN00b	Emperor_Norton	o rly, i am not too sure, i mean if even linux users in here flame me for demanding games for linux.....
2006-09-28T05:59:00.000Z	Emperor_Norton	ProN00b	developing nations are getting into this "Cheap PC = Runs linux" thing
2006-09-28T05:59:00.000Z	ProN00b	Emperor_Norton	and i am not getting into the "cheap pc = runs games" thing, do you ?
2006-09-28T06:00:00.000Z	ProN00b	Emperor_Norton	next south korea ? you are dreaming... america won't allow a success storry like that again, it will bomb em away
2006-09-28T06:01:00.000Z	Emperor_Norton	ProN00b	China is likely to be next South Korea in terms in game's, and china is developing the $125 dual core PC.
2006-09-28T06:03:00.000Z	ProN00b	Emperor_Norton	thats just a little weaker than my current system, and i can barely run gnome here
2006-09-28T06:04:00.000Z	Emperor_Norton	ProN00b	It will probably run xcfe or something much scaled down...but regardless the integration of the "People's OS" to china will be a "very big thing"
2006-09-28T06:05:00.000Z	ProN00b	Emperor_Norton	still, this thing won't run any cool games
2006-09-28T06:07:00.000Z	ProN00b	Emperor_Norton	naw, nawt rly ^^ they will all pirate windows xp
