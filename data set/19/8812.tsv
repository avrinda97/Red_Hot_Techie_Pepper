2007-02-03T14:35:00.000Z	iulian		i need some help on ubuntu server 6.10
2007-02-03T14:35:00.000Z	iulian		i just installed it and i can't connect to ftp
2007-02-03T14:35:00.000Z	iulian		sny ideea? i'm a new to linux
2007-02-03T14:35:00.000Z	Tido`	iulian	it probably doesn't install a ftp server by default
2007-02-03T14:36:00.000Z	iulian	Tido`	how can I do it?
2007-02-03T14:36:00.000Z	Tido`	iulian	well first do you want to actually have ftp or something like ssh/sftp?
2007-02-03T14:37:00.000Z	iulian		well, I want it for a webserver
2007-02-03T14:37:00.000Z	iulian		so I need ftp
2007-02-03T14:38:00.000Z	iulian	Tido`	I installed openssh-server and i suppose sftp is for using with ssh?
2007-02-03T14:38:00.000Z	Tido`		yes iulian, and if it's just you accessing the server I highly recommend using sftp/ssh instead of ftp
2007-02-03T14:39:00.000Z	Tido`	iulian	it's more secure to use sftp/ssh, but if you need a real ftp server, read this: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ProFTPD?action=show&redirect=ProFTP
2007-02-03T14:39:00.000Z	iulian	Tido`	just me and a friend will access this server
2007-02-03T14:40:00.000Z	Tido`	iulian	are you accessing it from a windows or linux machine?
2007-02-03T14:40:00.000Z	iulian	Tido`	what about installing sftp/?
2007-02-03T14:40:00.000Z	iulian	Tido`	from a windows machine
2007-02-03T14:40:00.000Z	Tido`	iulian	install WinSCP on your windows machine, you'll find it works great.  Use whatever port you're using for ssh (probably 22)
2007-02-03T14:42:00.000Z	iulian	Tido`	yes, i use port 22 for ssh. So, if I install WinSCP I'll be able to use sftp? Now I'm using putty for ssh
2007-02-03T14:42:00.000Z	Tido`		yes iulian
2007-02-03T14:43:00.000Z	iulian	Tido`	ok, thanks. I'll try now :)
