2004-11-26T11:38:00.000Z	Friczy	GFXstyLER	dont run any program as root if it is not necessary
2004-11-26T11:38:00.000Z	GFXstyLER		i dont use them much but i would like to use root instead of sudo, because i learned it like that
2004-11-26T11:38:00.000Z	Friczy	GFXstyLER	if your program has a remote exploitable hole, then all of your system can be rooted
