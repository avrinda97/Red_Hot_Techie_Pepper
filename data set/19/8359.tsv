2007-07-27T06:35:00.000Z	foug	Pici	thanks i'l try that to
2007-08-02T05:34:00.000Z	Pici	foug	/etc/X11/xorg.conf
2007-08-02T05:36:00.000Z	foug	Pici	kitche: well, i just bought this new mointor and it wants me to run X86Config
2007-08-02T05:37:00.000Z	Pici	foug	do a `sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg`
2007-08-02T05:46:00.000Z	foug	Pici	after doing sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg i selected the wrong resolution, editing xorg.conf doesn't fix the problem and when i open terminal it's just a white screen.
2007-08-02T05:47:00.000Z	Pici	foug	run it from a vtty, ctrl-alt-f1
2007-08-02T05:54:00.000Z	foug	Pici	that didn't fix it
2007-08-02T05:55:00.000Z	foug	Pici	is there a system restore or something so i can go back to my settings 10 minutes ago?
2007-08-02T05:56:00.000Z	Pici	foug	Those tools create backups of the xorg.conf files. You should have some extra copies in /etc/X11/ Then just sudo mv it on top of the one that isnt working.
2007-08-02T05:56:00.000Z	Pici	foug	I'm going afk so you'll have to ask the channel if you have any other issues, good luck.
2007-08-02T06:00:00.000Z	foug	Pici	ok i used one of my old xorg.conf files and it still isn't working
2007-08-02T06:06:00.000Z	foug	Pici	any idea how i can change my reso? nothing is working
2007-08-02T06:07:00.000Z	foug	Pici	doing that command you told me to do messed it all up
2008-01-14T07:56:00.000Z	Pici	foug	ctrl-alt-d iirc
2008-01-14T07:57:00.000Z	foug	Pici	you rock, thankd
2008-01-14T07:59:00.000Z	Pici	foug	yep
2008-01-14T08:00:00.000Z	Pici	foug	no, ccsm isnt the name of the package, its compizconfig-settings-manager.
