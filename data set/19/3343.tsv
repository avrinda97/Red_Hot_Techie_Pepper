2010-08-22T23:21:00.000Z	jmeng		Hey there! I'm using ubuntu lucid. Now when I try installing kontact-related packages (kontact, korganizer, ...), apt-get complains that there are unresolved dependencies (kdepimlibs5 for example), which is not being installed. Any idea what that is about? Oh, it says E: brocken packages at the end, too.
2010-08-22T23:22:00.000Z	abhijit	jmeng	go to system>administration>synaptic and fix broken packages
