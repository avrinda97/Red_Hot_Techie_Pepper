2011-10-21T11:07:00.000Z	KevinSjoberg		I'm running a ubuntu server in production. And having some memory issues. I've got 1024 mb of RAM but 950 mb of it is it cache. What does that mean?
2011-10-21T11:07:00.000Z	KevinSjoberg		Because top saying I'm just using about 30% but vmstat says I'm using about 91% where a lot of it is in cache.
2011-10-21T11:09:00.000Z	smw	KevinSjoberg	it means you have no ram problems
2011-10-21T11:09:00.000Z	smw	KevinSjoberg	do a free -m
2011-10-21T11:10:00.000Z	smw	KevinSjoberg	This line gives the best statistics -/+ buffers/cache:        863       2898
2011-10-21T11:10:00.000Z	KevinSjoberg	smw	That line gives me -/+ buffers/cache used: 0 free: 1024
2011-10-21T11:11:00.000Z	smw	KevinSjoberg	that is not possible. lol
2011-10-21T11:11:00.000Z	smw	KevinSjoberg	please pastebin the entire ouput
2011-10-21T11:12:00.000Z	smw	KevinSjoberg	?
2011-10-21T11:13:00.000Z	KevinSjoberg	smw	Sure. Here https://gist.github.com/345611
2011-10-21T11:13:00.000Z	KevinSjoberg	smw	Sorry wrong paste. Here http://pastebin.com/QxFHnpcq
2011-10-21T11:15:00.000Z	smw	KevinSjoberg	um...those numbers don't add up
2011-10-21T11:15:00.000Z	KevinSjoberg	smw	I know. Seems pretty missleading.
2011-10-21T11:15:00.000Z	smw	KevinSjoberg	according to what you posted, you are using 0 memory
2011-10-21T11:15:00.000Z	smw	KevinSjoberg	I don't know what to tell you
2011-10-21T11:16:00.000Z	KevinSjoberg	smw	Yeah. It's a virtual machine does that change things?
2011-10-21T11:16:00.000Z	smw	KevinSjoberg	it is probably the kernel confused about the VM.
2011-10-21T11:17:00.000Z	smw	KevinSjoberg	I don't know enough.
2011-10-21T11:17:00.000Z	KevinSjoberg	smw	It's okay. Thanks anyway.
