2009-09-22T08:37:00.000Z	Mr_Giraffe		hi, for some reason when I try to connect to my wireless network via static IP, I can ping the router but nothing else. Every field is as it should be...what gives?
2009-09-22T08:37:00.000Z	MrFSL	Mr_Giraffe	can you ping your dns?
2009-09-22T08:40:00.000Z	MrFSL	Mr_Giraffe	route -n
2009-09-22T08:41:00.000Z	Mr_Giraffe	MrFSL	what exactly am I doing here?
2009-09-22T08:41:00.000Z	MrFSL	Mr_Giraffe	checking your routing table
2009-09-22T08:42:00.000Z	Mr_Giraffe	MrFSL	I'm trying to connect with wireless
2009-09-22T08:42:00.000Z	MrFSL	Mr_Giraffe	sudo cat /etc/resolv.conf
2009-09-22T08:44:00.000Z	MrFSL	Mr_Giraffe	lets see the whole routing table
2009-09-22T08:44:00.000Z	Mr_Giraffe	MrFSL	if you insist
2009-09-22T08:45:00.000Z	MrFSL	Mr_Giraffe	I don't insist

2009-09-22T08:45:00.000Z	MrFSL	Mr_Giraffe	Just trying to help... I think I understand your issue, you are wired to a router that you are trying to access wirelessly
2009-09-22T08:46:00.000Z	Mr_Giraffe	MrFSL	I'm wired to it because I can access it wirelessly, but not the internet wirelessly
2009-09-22T08:46:00.000Z	Mr_Giraffe	MrFSL	I'm doing that because DHCP isn't working on the router
2009-09-22T08:47:00.000Z	Mr_Giraffe	MrFSL	any idea what the issue is?
2009-09-22T08:48:00.000Z	MrFSL	Mr_Giraffe	I understand - one issue is that your wired network 192.168.0.0/24 but you wireless network is 192.168.0.0/20
2009-09-22T08:48:00.000Z	Mr_Giraffe	MrFSL	that's what's on the router page as the subnet mask
2009-09-22T08:49:00.000Z	MrFSL	Mr_Giraffe	can I PM you?
2009-09-22T08:49:00.000Z	Mr_Giraffe	MrFSL	by all means go ahead
