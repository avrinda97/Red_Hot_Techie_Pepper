2007-06-09T08:01:00.000Z	shiester_miester		sebas: sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart
2007-06-09T08:01:00.000Z	shiester_miester		thats if ur using gnome
2007-06-09T08:01:00.000Z	r00723r0	shiester_miester	NO!
2007-06-09T08:09:00.000Z	r00723r0	shiester_miester	that's a lie
2007-06-09T08:09:00.000Z	r00723r0	shiester_miester	most games do not work fine with wine
2007-06-09T08:11:00.000Z	r00723r0	shiester_miester	you should have said that your games run well in wine
2007-06-09T08:11:00.000Z	r00723r0	shiester_miester	not that most games run well in wine
2007-06-09T08:18:00.000Z	r00723r0	shiester_miester	the only way to get full support of games on linux is for linux itself to become popular
2007-06-09T08:18:00.000Z	r00723r0	shiester_miester	no
2007-06-09T08:18:00.000Z	r00723r0	shiester_miester	games coming out for linux will not help
2007-06-09T08:18:00.000Z	r00723r0	shiester_miester	at least not much
2007-06-09T08:19:00.000Z	r00723r0	shiester_miester	if there is more software, not many people will use it more
2007-06-09T08:21:00.000Z	r00723r0	shiester_miester	of course it crashes less
2007-06-09T08:21:00.000Z	r00723r0	shiester_miester	furthermore ubuntu, like any flavor of linux, is technically superior to microsoft's products
2007-06-09T08:21:00.000Z	r00723r0	shiester_miester	because linux is modular
2007-06-09T08:22:00.000Z	r00723r0	shiester_miester	because windows is good enough
2007-06-09T08:23:00.000Z	r00723r0	shiester_miester	it is good enough
2007-06-09T08:23:00.000Z	r00723r0	shiester_miester	but windows came first
