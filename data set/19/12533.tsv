2005-10-05T15:39:00.000Z	dalamar		if i run 'mount' /media/usbdisk says 'rw' by it, but when I try and delete something or write to it it says its read only .. what gives?
2005-10-05T15:41:00.000Z	davmor2	dalamar	it might be the file itself that is write protected
2005-10-05T15:43:00.000Z	davmor2	dalamar	did you sudo the mount
2005-10-05T15:44:00.000Z	davmor2	dalamar	try sudo chmod -R 666 /path/to/file
2005-10-05T15:45:00.000Z	dalamar	davmor2	no luck, again the error with read only file system
2005-10-05T15:47:00.000Z	davmor2	dalamar	if it is anything like mine then have you got 2 usbdisks show up
2005-10-05T15:48:00.000Z	dalamar	davmor2	only one /media/usbdisk listed
2005-10-05T15:50:00.000Z	davmor2	dalamar	try umounting it in console with sudo umount /media/usbdisk then remount it with sudo mount /dev/sda then see if you can edit it with root
2005-10-05T15:52:00.000Z	dalamar	davmor2	it says i have to specify filesystem type when I try and remount, how would i do that?
2005-10-05T15:54:00.000Z	davmor2	dalamar	: sudo mount -t vfat32 /dev/sda
2005-10-05T15:55:00.000Z	davmor2	dalamar	I think
2005-10-05T15:57:00.000Z	dalamar	davmor2	still says read only ;/ this is so wierd, it used to automount fine with read and write
2005-10-05T15:58:00.000Z	davmor2	dalamar	did you try to remove it with sudo rm filename.mp3
2005-10-05T16:00:00.000Z	dalamar	davmor2	still gives the read only file system error
2005-10-06T16:00:00.000Z	davmor2	dalamar	is there anything on you can't put back on?
2005-10-06T16:02:00.000Z	dalamar	davmor2	well some save games if I cant get them off first is all
