2012-04-21T01:22:00.000Z	DasEi	angs	another way to see processes are top and htop; sudo apt-get install htop && htop
2012-04-21T01:22:00.000Z	DasEi	angs	kill  terminates single PID's , killall their childprocesses, too
2012-05-27T21:45:00.000Z	DasEi	angs	more precise question ?
2012-05-27T21:49:00.000Z	angs	DasEi	I want to setup dual monitor, the external monitor is 19 inch, I could not figure out how to set it up, I tried all resolution options but each time it gives me error like "requested position/size for CRTC 147 is outside the allowed limit: position=(1366, 0), size=(1280, 768), maximum=(1440, 1440)". how should set it up? or where can I find more info about how to set dual display on ubuntu 12.04?
2012-05-27T21:50:00.000Z	DasEi	angs	I see, which graphics card ?
2012-05-27T21:53:00.000Z	DasEi	angs	install and run hwinfo for a dedicated hardwarelisting, so radeon series, well follow above dualhead link and  :
2012-05-27T21:55:00.000Z	DasEi	angs	by default xorg.conf now is empty, for your error could also use it to set the range of your failing screen
2012-05-27T21:57:00.000Z	angs	DasEi	Is it easy to explain how can I set xorg.conf for the range that I get error?
2012-05-27T22:00:00.000Z	DasEi	angs	no , I'd use the tutorial, then see what it made from /etc/X11/xorg.conf and then try to modify it, if there are still problems, directly xorg.conf would involve getting the right specs of both screens (like looking up in x's logfile)
2012-05-27T22:02:00.000Z	angs	DasEi	thank you very much
