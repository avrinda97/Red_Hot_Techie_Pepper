2010-05-31T18:13:00.000Z	geirha	Twain_32	Right-click -> extract
2010-05-31T18:17:00.000Z	geirha	Twain_32	Normally only root has write access there.
2010-05-31T18:17:00.000Z	geirha	Twain_32	sudo unzip the_zipfile.zip
2010-05-31T18:29:00.000Z	geirha	Twain_32	« sudo chown $USER:$USER /var/www »  After that you will have write access to it.
2010-05-31T18:32:00.000Z	geirha	Twain_32	Giving yourself ownership of /var/www is safer than running around as root
2010-05-31T18:33:00.000Z	Twain_32	geirha	so im copying "web" folder from home doing this  cp files /var/www/ and i got this cp: omitting directory `web
2010-05-31T18:33:00.000Z	geirha	Twain_32	« sudo chown $USER:$USER /var/www »  After that you will have write access to it so you can drag and drop files into it.
2010-05-31T18:34:00.000Z	Twain_32	geirha	what that means ??? $USER:$USER
2010-05-31T18:34:00.000Z	Twain_32	geirha	but i wan't to work with terminal :(
2010-05-31T18:34:00.000Z	geirha	Twain_32	Which user and group that should have ownersip of the folder.
2010-05-31T18:34:00.000Z	geirha	Twain_32	No, it's a one time thing.
