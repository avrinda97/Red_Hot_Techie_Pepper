2007-05-04T06:25:00.000Z	bobstro	stittel	yes, but open is more like what he'll use at work then, no?
2007-05-04T06:26:00.000Z	stittel	bobstro	I'd probably prefer the SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop.
2007-05-04T06:27:00.000Z	bobstro	stittel	so much for freedom, eh?
2007-05-04T06:27:00.000Z	stittel	bobstro	Normal users don't care about freedom. And normal users don't read source code either.
2007-05-04T06:28:00.000Z	bobstro	stittel	sure, so they happily pay jobs or gates. i don't see much of a difference myself.
2007-05-04T06:28:00.000Z	bobstro	stittel	just because apple is "cool" doesn't make it less evil.
2007-05-04T06:28:00.000Z	stittel	bobstro	Mac OS X delivers the best "it just works" experience. Windows is ridiculous and Linux has still a long way to go.
2007-05-04T06:28:00.000Z	bobstro	stittel	if you like DRM sure.
2007-05-04T06:28:00.000Z	stittel	bobstro	I am a computer-scientist, not an Open Source evangelist.
2007-05-04T06:29:00.000Z	bobstro	stittel	i'm agnostic, but i don't attribute apple with anything above microsoft.
2007-05-04T06:29:00.000Z	bobstro	stittel	it's just ironic that paying apple is "cool" (drm lock-in and all) while microsoft is "square".
2007-05-04T06:30:00.000Z	stittel	bobstro	If Windows was the best operating system around, I'd use Windows and advocate it.
2007-05-04T06:30:00.000Z	stittel	bobstro	My main problem with Windows is, that it sucks. :)
2007-05-04T06:30:00.000Z	stittel	bobstro	Not that it is from Microsoft.
2007-05-04T06:31:00.000Z	bobstro	stittel	i despise windows, because it doesn't work, yes. apple *does* give a good end-user experience, but i'm pleased that linux (ubuntu) is getting closer to that.
2007-05-04T06:32:00.000Z	bobstro	stittel	it's annoying that many of the reasons linux *can't* "quite" get there are due to proprietary lock-in.
2007-05-04T06:32:00.000Z	stittel	bobstro	are you coming to #aoirthoir too?
2007-05-04T06:32:00.000Z	bobstro	stittel	sure, briefly i guess.
