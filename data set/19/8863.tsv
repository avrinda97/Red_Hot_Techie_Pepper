2007-01-25T11:25:00.000Z	CorpseFeeder		What does this mean? The filename "NAME-DESKTOP" indicates that this file is of type "desktop configuration file". The contents of the file indicate that the file is of type "x-directory/smb-share". If you open this file, the file might present a security risk to your system. I can't work out how to browse with smb.
2007-01-25T11:26:00.000Z	CorpseFeeder		ok, samba then
2007-01-25T11:27:00.000Z	CorpseFeeder		does anyone know how to browse files/folders on the network with samba?
2007-01-25T11:27:00.000Z	shatrat	CorpseFeeder	did you try the Network Servers thing in the Places menu?
2007-01-25T11:28:00.000Z	CorpseFeeder	shatrat	yes. I can't get it to work
2007-01-25T11:28:00.000Z	shatrat	CorpseFeeder	Does it show nothing at all?
2007-01-25T11:29:00.000Z	CorpseFeeder	shatrat	it shows windows network icon, and if I click it, it then shows the workgroup name, and after that is a list of computers on the network.. but that is as far as I can get.
2007-01-25T11:30:00.000Z	shatrat	CorpseFeeder	try hitting F5 to refresh it
2007-01-25T11:30:00.000Z	shatrat	CorpseFeeder	I know it wont always let me explore the networked server the first time I click it
2007-01-25T11:31:00.000Z	CorpseFeeder	shatrat	refreshing doesn't help
2007-01-25T11:32:00.000Z	shatrat	CorpseFeeder	Does it give some kind of an error?
2007-01-25T11:32:00.000Z	CorpseFeeder	shatrat	yes.
2007-01-25T11:32:00.000Z	shatrat	CorpseFeeder	Please elaborate sir.
2007-01-25T11:34:00.000Z	shatrat	CorpseFeeder	Could you post the error, or post a pastebin link if its more than a line or two
2007-01-25T11:34:00.000Z	CorpseFeeder	shatrat	elaboration is here http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/2836/
2007-01-25T11:36:00.000Z	shatrat	CorpseFeeder	hold on a sec, thinking
2007-01-25T11:38:00.000Z	shatrat	CorpseFeeder	It seems like you arent havent the same problem I had with samba.  I found a thread that seemed like your problem on the forums though.  Maybe something there that can help you.
2007-01-25T11:39:00.000Z	CorpseFeeder	shatrat	it's entirely possible that I may have deleted something from my ubuntu system which it needs to use samba file sharing. This may be why it does not appear to know how to browse the other computers on the network, giving the error instead...
2007-01-25T11:39:00.000Z	shatrat	CorpseFeeder	 you can try "sudo apt-get install samba smbfs"
