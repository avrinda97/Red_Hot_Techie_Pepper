2006-07-19T16:37:00.000Z	regress		example: "sudo mount /dev/hdc2 /myhdd" ->
2006-07-19T16:38:00.000Z	regress		mount: /dev/hdc2 already mounted or /myhdd busy
2006-07-19T16:39:00.000Z	regress		yeah, that seems it probably
2006-07-19T16:40:00.000Z	regress		haha, no problem!
2006-07-19T16:40:00.000Z	regress		I'll keep it up...i just recorded some chinese language tapes to mp3, and I wanted to get those mp3's off before I install ubuntu
2006-07-19T06:02:00.000Z	regress		if my hd has "Linux LVM" as the system type, how can I mount it?
2006-07-19T06:02:00.000Z	kbrooks	regress	use /dev/mapper
2006-07-19T06:02:00.000Z	regress		is there a man page for that?
2006-07-19T06:03:00.000Z	kbrooks	regress	No.  It is a directory of LVM devices which you can mount
2006-07-19T06:03:00.000Z	regress		so mount /dev/myHDwithLVM /dev/mapper?
2006-07-19T06:03:00.000Z	kbrooks	regress	No. I said *directory*
2006-07-19T06:04:00.000Z	regress		ah
2006-07-19T06:04:00.000Z	kbrooks	regress	no... it doesnt have directories under there
2006-07-19T06:04:00.000Z	kbrooks	regress	also, specify a mount point
2006-07-19T06:05:00.000Z	regress	kbrooks	could you give me an example command?
2006-07-19T06:05:00.000Z	kbrooks		mount /dev/... /path/to/place/where/you/want/it/mounted
2006-07-19T06:05:00.000Z	kbrooks	regress	I can't...
2006-07-19T06:05:00.000Z	regress		in this case is hdc2
2006-07-19T06:05:00.000Z	kbrooks	regress	i dont have a LVM device
