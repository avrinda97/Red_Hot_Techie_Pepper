2011-09-21T22:35:00.000Z	mordof	ubun	what does it tell you when it can't boot up?
2011-09-21T22:36:00.000Z	ubun	mordof	nothing it just sits there with a black screen only says something when i restart it. (normal shutdown text)
2011-09-21T22:36:00.000Z	mordof	ubun	have you tried alt+f1 to drop to TTY?
2011-09-21T22:37:00.000Z	ubun	mordof	ok that went to the tty. but now what?
2011-09-21T22:37:00.000Z	mordof	ubun	try typing startx
2011-09-21T22:39:00.000Z	ubun	mordof	it says welcome to ubuntu 11.04. then the warnings
2011-09-21T22:39:00.000Z	mordof	ubun	what warnings?
2011-09-21T22:39:00.000Z	ubun	mordof	the warranty stuff. this comes withi no WARANTY or whatever
2011-09-21T22:40:00.000Z	mordof	ubun	did it not give you any error at all when trying to use startx?
2011-09-21T22:41:00.000Z	ubun	mordof	no but let me double check
2011-09-21T22:41:00.000Z	ubun	mordof	wait.
2011-09-21T22:42:00.000Z	ubun	mordof	it says usr/bin/x: not found then it gives up
2011-09-21T22:44:00.000Z	mordof	ubun	ok. that's a starting point.. I don't really know how to help - but that will improve your odds for getting help in here if you include that error in your question
