2006-06-06T05:53:00.000Z	nelisa		anyone here successfully ripping mp3s?
2006-06-06T05:54:00.000Z	nelisa		I've hit an error following the guide
2006-06-06T05:54:00.000Z	Managu	nelisa	almost certainly so.  But that's probably not what you really want to know.
2006-06-06T05:55:00.000Z	Managu		zcat[1] : the program hdparm, or the file /etc/hdparm.conf
2006-06-06T05:56:00.000Z	nelisa	Managu	I need to put my french lessons on a Creative Zen, so its much a "hardware" constraint here
2006-06-06T05:57:00.000Z	nelisa		my error: Sound Juicer could not extract this CD.
2006-06-06T05:57:00.000Z	nelisa		Reason: Could not create GStreamer encoders for MP3 Encoding
2006-06-06T05:57:00.000Z	nelisa		I've followed the doco to the letter
2006-06-06T05:57:00.000Z	Managu	nelisa	mm, the Zen acts like a USB key, no?
2006-06-06T05:58:00.000Z	nelisa	Managu	but it only plays mp3 files
2006-06-06T05:58:00.000Z	nelisa	Managu	can you help me pass this one?
2006-06-06T05:58:00.000Z	Managu	nelisa	ooh, now that error's more interesting.  I'd suggest you ask ubotu about !restricted.  Summary: "sudo apt-get instal gstreamer-0.10-ffmpeg" (if it's legal for you to do so)
2006-06-06T06:00:00.000Z	Managu	nelisa	or something similar.
2006-06-06T06:00:00.000Z	nelisa	Managu	let me do it
2006-06-06T06:01:00.000Z	nelisa	Managu	it's upgrading to 6.06, looks like I'm blocked for a while
2006-06-06T06:02:00.000Z	nelisa		thought migration would be less painful
2006-06-06T06:02:00.000Z	Managu	nelisa	ok.  You should look at the wiki entry on restricted formats (MP3 is a restricted format).  That might help a bit.
2006-06-06T06:02:00.000Z	nelisa		just now I realized how restrictive/copyrighted is the computer world
2006-06-06T06:03:00.000Z	nelisa	Managu	I've followed the guide there and got stuck on that error
