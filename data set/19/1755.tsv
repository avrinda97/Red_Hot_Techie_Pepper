2011-07-18T22:03:00.000Z	babble	KM0201	(sorry)
2011-07-18T22:04:00.000Z	babble	KM0201	that I'm not at all sure of :)
2011-07-18T22:06:00.000Z	babble	KM0201	there's a default BIOS setting in my BIOS config for "Fan Always On" - *disabling* that doesn't change anything - is there something the natty installer would have inherited from that?
2011-07-18T22:06:00.000Z	KM0201	babble	so "fans always on" in the BIOS, dosn't make them stay always on?... thats weird.. i don't think the Natty Installer would have "inherited" anything from that, but like I said, i've never had that issue.
2011-07-18T22:07:00.000Z	KM0201	babble	what is your laptop model again
2011-07-18T22:07:00.000Z	babble	KM0201	my fault - I"m not explaining my problem. my fans *are* always on. In Winders, they cycle on and off as needed. I'll live with the fan running for now if that's my best bet
2011-07-18T22:08:00.000Z	KM0201	babble	ok.. so your fans are always on, but you're trying to figure out a way to shut them on/off, like in 'doze, correct?
2011-07-18T22:08:00.000Z	babble	KM0201	ideally, yeah, I'd like 'sensors' to turn fans on/off as needed. ('sensors' or whatever else I may need)
2011-07-18T22:11:00.000Z	babble	KM0201	thanks for fiddling with this for me :)
2011-07-18T22:11:00.000Z	KM0201	babble	turns up a lot of hits on that machine and "fans not working" but not much else.
2011-07-18T22:12:00.000Z	babble	KM0201	yeah, I've been through the forums and googling for a week or so. hehe.
2011-07-18T22:12:00.000Z	KM0201	babble	yeah, unfortunately thats the extent of my knowledge on this, which sadly, is very limited.
2011-07-18T22:12:00.000Z	KM0201	babble	i dunno.. i would just set the fans to be "always on" if it were me...
2011-07-18T22:13:00.000Z	babble	KM0201	no problem; I'd rather have them always on than not running at all :)
2011-07-18T22:13:00.000Z	babble	KM0201	I can live with it for now.
2011-07-24T05:46:00.000Z	KM0201	babble	thatas your prob.. :) xchat-gnome compared to regular xchat, is like a porche to a pinto
2011-07-24T05:47:00.000Z	babble	KM0201	haha, I get that, but I'm more or less happy with *-gnome :)
2011-07-24T05:47:00.000Z	KM0201	babble	yeah, its a simple client, but really doesn't have a lot of options (as you see)
