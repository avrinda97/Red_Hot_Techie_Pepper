2005-12-22T09:18:00.000Z	bnD		hi, wondering if anyone could tell me a command to remove kde?
2005-12-22T09:18:00.000Z	bnD		thanks guys
2005-12-22T09:19:00.000Z	bnD		get it all off!
2005-12-22T09:20:00.000Z	_jason	bnD	I removed kde earlier today, remove the package libqt3-mt
2005-12-22T09:43:00.000Z	_jason	bnD	du
2006-01-24T14:35:00.000Z	_jason	bnD	no
2006-01-24T14:35:00.000Z	bnD	_jason	kde + gnome = bloat
2006-01-24T14:36:00.000Z	_jason	bnD	you mean combined or both individually?
2006-01-24T14:36:00.000Z	bnD	_jason	combined
2006-01-24T14:36:00.000Z	_jason	bnD	you would only run one at a time presumably
2006-01-24T14:36:00.000Z	bnD	_jason	would still have the footprint
2006-01-24T14:36:00.000Z	_jason	bnD	what footprint?  hard drive space?
2006-01-24T14:37:00.000Z	bnD	_jason	yep
2006-01-24T14:41:00.000Z	_jason	bnD	you just lgout and log back in when that is done, then do what bnd said
2006-01-24T14:41:00.000Z	bnD	_jason	i think you meant to highlight meisam :P
2006-01-24T14:41:00.000Z	_jason	bnD	thanks
2006-01-25T10:59:00.000Z	bnD	_jason	that was the closest to a RTFM ive seen in here lol, this channel is so nice
2006-01-25T11:00:00.000Z	_jason	bnD	if I idle here for a long time I start feeling like yelling RTFM, cus you forget it's different people asking the same question... so I try not to stay here for long continuous periods of time :)
2006-01-25T11:01:00.000Z	bnD	_jason	lol
