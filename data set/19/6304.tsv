2008-02-21T13:37:00.000Z	AndrewB	ph0rensic	most applications are just  $appName &
2008-02-21T13:38:00.000Z	AndrewB	ph0rensic	& backgrounds the process so that you don't get aload of messages in the terminal, it also means that you can continue to use said terminal
2008-02-21T13:39:00.000Z	ph0rensic	AndrewB	wow sick, thanks that is good to know.. especially when emerald crashes
2008-02-21T13:39:00.000Z	AndrewB	ph0rensic	sadly if you cloase the terminal bbox then it closes the app
2008-02-21T13:40:00.000Z	ph0rensic	AndrewB	oh so I still have to use the run app applet
2008-02-21T13:40:00.000Z	AndrewB	ph0rensic	I don't know what you mean
2008-02-21T13:41:00.000Z	AndrewB	ph0rensic	it means not evertyhing will be installed, there is possibly a conflict or something hasn't installed correct previousley that you need now

2008-02-21T13:41:00.000Z	ph0rensic	AndrewB	alt-f2 ... it wont stop the process  like it does when you close out a terminal
2008-02-21T13:42:00.000Z	AndrewB	ph0rensic	yeah thats correct
2008-02-21T13:43:00.000Z	AndrewB	ph0rensic	running in terminal is normally good for debbugging etc, but not a whole lot more
2008-02-21T13:44:00.000Z	ph0rensic	AndrewB	yeah..mostly I am setting up some launchers for awn hehe
