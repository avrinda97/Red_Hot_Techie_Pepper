2008-11-16T05:50:00.000Z	bullgard4		What is the name of the list of the installed program packages on my Ubuntu computer?
2008-11-16T05:51:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	bullgard4	synaptics? or "dpkg -l"
2008-11-16T05:58:00.000Z	bullgard4	zsquareplusc	Synaptics is unrelated to the question which I have put.
2008-11-16T07:34:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	bullgard4	dpgk --get-selections
2008-11-16T07:47:00.000Z	bullgard4	zsquareplusc	Your answer is false. '~$ sudo rsnapshot hourly' now obtains: "Errors were found in /etc/rsnapshot.conf, rsnapshot cannot continue. If you think an entry looks right, make sure you don't have spaces." But I checked that tabs and spaces are all right in the line that I added.
2008-11-16T07:48:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	bullgard4	hm. what was the topic again?
2008-11-16T07:48:00.000Z	bullgard4	zsquareplusc	  What line do I have to add in rsnapshot.conf in order to backup also the list of currently installed packages? Is "backup  dpkg -l  localhost/" the correct syntax?
2008-11-16T07:49:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	bullgard4	ah. that one. well dpkg --get-selections prints to stdout you have to redirect the output like dpkg --get-selections > packages.txt  later you could then use --get-selections to import the list again
2008-11-16T07:51:00.000Z	bullgard4	zsquareplusc	What do you mean by "later"? It is a config file. There is no "later".
2008-11-16T07:52:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	bullgard4	you backup, i mena later when you're going to use the backed up data to restore your machine in case of problems
2008-11-16T07:53:00.000Z	bullgard4	zsquareplusc	The procedure which you suggest is a procedure of hand-work. rsnapshot is there to do backup automatically. This is a difference. I'd like to backup this one file too but automaticall, not as an additional hand-work.
2008-11-16T07:54:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	bullgard4	it will get the list of packages automatically. backing up is usually not the problem. restoring is (if its not just a 1:1 copy..)
2008-11-16T07:56:00.000Z	bullgard4	zsquareplusc	What do you mean by "it"? rsnapshot will not get the list of packages automatically. It throws an error message.
2008-11-16T07:58:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	bullgard4	sorry i dont know exactly what rsnapshot solves for you. you were plaing around with dpkg -l and i said dpkg --get-selections may be better in that case. thats all. both commands list packages to stdout. but -l is more for humans than machines
2008-11-16T07:59:00.000Z	bullgard4	zsquareplusc	I agree. Thank you for your effort.
2008-11-25T07:21:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	bullgard4	you know firefox and how you can open multiple pages in one window? thats tabbed
2008-11-25T07:21:00.000Z	bullgard4	zsquareplusc	nickrud Thank you very much for explaining.
2008-12-01T07:22:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	bullgard4	personal package archive. it should hold .deb
2008-12-01T07:22:00.000Z	bullgard4	zsquareplusc	Thank you.
