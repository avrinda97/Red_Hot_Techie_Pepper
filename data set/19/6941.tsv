2007-11-21T00:01:00.000Z	Shapeshifter		how can I run "vpnc-connect" and "vpnc-disconnect" as a normal user?
2007-11-21T00:01:00.000Z	CaBa\	Shapeshifter	use the vpnc plugin for network manager
2007-11-21T00:02:00.000Z	Shapeshifter	CaBa\	Uhm, I would prefer to use my own script
2007-11-21T00:03:00.000Z	CaBa\	Shapeshifter	well you cannot set an sbit on scripts... you need a daemon that runs as root or a binary that performs your action and runs suid
2007-11-21T00:04:00.000Z	Shapeshifter	CaBa\	mhh, ok
2007-11-21T00:04:00.000Z	CaBa\	Shapeshifter	what makes u not want to use the network manager thing?
2007-11-21T00:04:00.000Z	CaBa\	Shapeshifter	u have an encrypted group /  user password and cannot enter it at the network manager thing?
2007-11-21T00:05:00.000Z	Shapeshifter	CaBa\	uhm, no, only that I've been having fun writing a script for the past few hours (noob), using zenity and integrating a wizard which can create .conf files from templates from the local universities or from scratch ;) Didn't know there's this plugin. But I'll have a look at it.
2007-11-21T00:07:00.000Z	CaBa\	Shapeshifter	its in the packages... just install "network-manager-vpnc" and u will have a menu in your network manager icon... considering that you _use_ network manager ;)
2007-11-21T00:07:00.000Z	Shapeshifter	CaBa\	I installed that thing but there's no change in there. Do I need to restart the network manager?
2007-11-21T00:08:00.000Z	CaBa\	Shapeshifter	i dont think so... u dont have a VPN-Connections thing when u click on the tray icon?
2007-11-21T00:09:00.000Z	Shapeshifter	CaBa\	no.
2007-11-21T00:10:00.000Z	Shapeshifter	CaBa\	I only have "manual configuration"
2007-11-21T00:10:00.000Z	CaBa\	Shapeshifter	well, that looks like you didnt use networkmanager up to now
2007-11-21T00:11:00.000Z	CaBa\	Shapeshifter	make a backup of /etc/network/interfaces, then clear it except everything that involves the "lo" device an reboot... that should do the thing... if u dont like it (namely networkmanager) just restore the old file and reboot again :P
2007-11-21T00:12:00.000Z	Shapeshifter	CaBa\	I am using it to switch wireless connections when outside. But I hade kind of a problem because at home I just receive an IP from my provider and everythings fine, then I went to my girlfriend and set up pppoe, and now I wasn't able to connect to the internet back home so I had to run dhclient manually. Haven't figured it out yet
2007-11-21T00:13:00.000Z	CaBa\	Shapeshifter	well those things NetworkManager is supposed to make easier
2007-11-21T00:13:00.000Z	CaBa\	Shapeshifter	for me it also doesnt - since it doesnt cooperate with my wireless device too nice :P
2007-11-21T00:13:00.000Z	Shapeshifter	CaBa\	well I'll just do what you said. brb
