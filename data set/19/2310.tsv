2010-05-10T23:20:00.000Z	queso		Is there something like the System Monitor's Processes tab that can give real-time statistics on which processes are sending/receiving data, and the amount?
2010-05-10T23:21:00.000Z	queso		(Sending and receiving, as in, network activity.)
2010-05-10T23:21:00.000Z	CogitoErgoSam	queso	 Check out netstat
2010-05-10T23:23:00.000Z	queso	CogitoErgoSam	Is netstat different from Network Tool's "Netstat" tab?
2010-05-10T23:25:00.000Z	CogitoErgoSam	queso	 I'm not sure if the Network Tools uses the netstat command; I do know that using netstat from the command line will offer you MUCH more flexibility in analyzing activity
2010-05-10T23:26:00.000Z	CogitoErgoSam	queso	 netstat from the command line can check traffic by protocol, by port, show you which processes are associated with it, states...you name it
2010-05-10T23:26:00.000Z	queso	CogitoErgoSam	okay, but how can I get a "top" like output from it?
2010-05-10T23:27:00.000Z	CogitoErgoSam	queso	 What traffic are you trying to find?  Are you trying to fix a specific problem?  If so lemme know what it is and I can try to help you find the best way to debug it
2010-05-10T23:27:00.000Z	CogitoErgoSam	queso	 Ok just a sec, I'll try to write up a sort for you
2010-05-10T23:28:00.000Z	queso	CogitoErgoSam	basically I just want to see which processes are making traffic, and how much :) it's not for any actual admin purposes.
2010-05-10T23:28:00.000Z	CogitoErgoSam	queso	 ok, that should be pretty easy; just a sec
2010-05-10T23:29:00.000Z	queso	CogitoErgoSam	Thanks :)
2010-05-10T23:33:00.000Z	CogitoErgoSam	queso	 I'm not sure if netstat will be the best one for live monitoring; most of my uses for it are in debugging, like checking which process is creating traffic on a certain port
2010-05-10T23:33:00.000Z	CogitoErgoSam	queso	 To analyze broader trends, you might be better off with a program like Wireshark
2010-05-10T23:36:00.000Z	queso	CogitoErgoSam	okay, thanks for your help -- I'll check out wireshark :)
2010-05-10T23:37:00.000Z	CogitoErgoSam	queso	 Wireshark is a great network auditing tool, since you can write filters to find very specific activity, and then drill down and analyze the actual data packets
2010-05-10T23:38:00.000Z	CogitoErgoSam	queso	 So you could see what's making traffic, and also what data it's sending and to where
2010-05-10T23:39:00.000Z	CogitoErgoSam	queso	 If you use wireshark just remember you'll probably need to run it as root
2010-05-10T23:40:00.000Z	queso	CogitoErgoSam	Thanks again.  Looks like a complex app, I'll have to see if I can figure it out.
