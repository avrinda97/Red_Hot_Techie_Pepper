2010-05-15T13:44:00.000Z	zigwoggler		ive just installed steam on ubuntu via playforlinux and now when i go and press uninstall on the menu it doesnt work?
2010-05-15T13:45:00.000Z	theadmin	zigwoggler	We don't support POL or WINE here.
2010-05-15T13:45:00.000Z	theadmin	zigwoggler	Just wait 6 or 7 months for the Linux steam, seriously
2010-05-15T13:45:00.000Z	theadmin	zigwoggler	I dunno, theoretically, it should have made a folder or something which you can just delete
2010-05-15T13:46:00.000Z	zigwoggler	theadmin	hmm 1 sec lemme just check
2010-05-15T13:49:00.000Z	zigwoggler	theadmin	any idea where this folder might be?
2010-05-15T13:49:00.000Z	theadmin	zigwoggler	If I recall correctly, PlayOnLinux should have asked
2010-05-15T13:50:00.000Z	zigwoggler	theadmin	but i uninstalled playonlinux thinking it would uniinstall steam and the other games etc. but it hasn't.
2010-05-15T13:51:00.000Z	theadmin	zigwoggler	Well, theoretically it's a dot folder somewhere inside your home directory
2010-05-15T13:52:00.000Z	zigwoggler	theadmin	just had a look and i can't seem to find it
2010-05-15T13:52:00.000Z	theadmin	zigwoggler	Try hitting Ctrl+H to display dotfiles/folders
2010-05-15T13:53:00.000Z	zigwoggler	theadmin	ok so i just delete the whole .wine folder?
2010-05-15T13:53:00.000Z	theadmin	zigwoggler	Sure why not :D
2010-05-15T13:53:00.000Z	theadmin	zigwoggler	Should be so.
2010-05-15T13:54:00.000Z	theadmin	zigwoggler	run "alacarte" and from it delete the Wine category
2010-05-15T13:57:00.000Z	theadmin	zigwoggler	From terminal or something
2010-05-15T13:59:00.000Z	zigwoggler	theadmin	all sorted now, thanks loads mate for all your help
2010-05-15T13:59:00.000Z	theadmin	zigwoggler	No problem :D
