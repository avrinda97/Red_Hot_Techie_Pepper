2007-04-21T09:26:00.000Z	Stinge1		I tried to install a SLAX distribution on top of my Ubuntu one, and it didn't bother to partition, so I was left with Lilo in the MBR. I re-installed Grub using a guide I found on Ubuntu forums, and it now boots into Grub and tries to boot into Ubuntu, but gets hung up shortly after the splash screen. Can anyone help?
2007-04-21T09:27:00.000Z	simonn	Stinge1	- any error messages?
2007-04-21T09:27:00.000Z	Stinge1	simonn	- none, just the splash screen goes away and turns into a blinking cursor.
2007-04-21T09:29:00.000Z	simonn	Stinge1	- what partitions do you have /dev/hd?? and/or /dev/sd??
2007-04-21T09:29:00.000Z	simonn	Stinge1	- all of them
2007-04-21T09:30:00.000Z	Stinge1	simonn	- isn't that all of them?
2007-04-21T09:30:00.000Z	Stinge1	simonn	- can I PM you?
2007-04-21T09:30:00.000Z	simonn	Stinge1	- Sure, I am new to IRC (seriously :) ) so what do I do?
2007-04-21T09:31:00.000Z	Stinge1	simonn	- what IRC client are you using?
2007-04-21T09:31:00.000Z	Stinge1	simonn	- look in a tab to your right
2007-04-21T09:35:00.000Z	Stinge1	simonn	- you there?
2007-04-21T09:38:00.000Z	simonn	Stinge1	- backup your home partition and repartition
2007-04-21T09:42:00.000Z	simonn	Stinge1	- I tried IMing you on this
2007-04-21T09:42:00.000Z	Stinge1	simonn	- I have a PM window open right now, you haven't responded
2007-04-21T09:43:00.000Z	Stinge1	simonn	- find my nick in the list on the right, and double-click it
2007-04-21T09:43:00.000Z	simonn	Stinge1	- have just IMed you(?).
2007-04-21T09:44:00.000Z	Stinge1	simonn	- it doesn't appear so
2007-04-21T09:46:00.000Z	Stinge1	simonn	- does it work now?
2007-04-21T09:47:00.000Z	simonn	Stinge1	- nope, nik is already registered
