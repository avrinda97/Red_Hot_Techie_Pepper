2008-09-13T18:15:00.000Z	cy21		i have installed a ubuntu server and i have GUI on it
2008-09-13T18:15:00.000Z	cy21		now.... i want to do remote-desktop from a windows machine
2008-09-13T18:15:00.000Z	cy21		i configured the remote desktop from the gui
2008-09-13T18:16:00.000Z	cy21		but i can't get to the remote desktop unless i start the gui (log in each time from desktop server)

2008-09-13T18:17:00.000Z	dns53	cy21	enable automatic login:  system > administration > login window and enable automatic logon
2008-09-13T18:17:00.000Z	cy21	dns53	any other way? by ssh?
2008-09-13T18:18:00.000Z	cy21	dns53	 can i do this trought ssh? i am in bed with a broken leg :D
2008-09-13T18:18:00.000Z	dns53	cy21	sure, install xming and putty, you can launch your applications even gnome-session if you want
2008-09-13T18:20:00.000Z	dns53	cy21	do you want to view your destktop (this requires you to have logged in) so you could enable automatic login
2008-09-13T18:20:00.000Z	cy21	dns53	i am logged in via ssh
2008-09-13T18:21:00.000Z	cy21	dns53	is there a console way to do this?
2008-09-13T18:21:00.000Z	dns53	cy21	the other option is to tunnel an x program through ssh, install putty and xming, in putty enable the x tunneling
2008-09-13T18:21:00.000Z	dns53	cy21	so you want the automatic login?
2008-09-13T18:21:00.000Z	cy21	dns53	yes
2008-09-13T18:24:00.000Z	dns53	cy21	you can also run: /usr/sbin/gdmsetup   through a ssh+x tunnel
