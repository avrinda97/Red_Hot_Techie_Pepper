2009-06-19T15:36:00.000Z	Jenk		Slart:I'm a newcomer to Linux...
2009-06-19T15:37:00.000Z	Jenk		perbl:why ?
2009-06-19T15:38:00.000Z	Jenk		Do i then use vim or something like that ?
2009-06-19T15:39:00.000Z	Jenk		perbl:yes, i'd like that, but i know neither head nor tails of vim ...
2009-06-19T15:40:00.000Z	Jenk		perbl:yes, but it supports Java much better.
2009-06-19T15:42:00.000Z	Jenk		perbl:just started c recently as part of curriculum in college, so i thought an IDE for C would be a better idea..
2009-06-19T15:43:00.000Z	Jenk		they teach me with MS-DOS
2009-06-19T15:45:00.000Z	Jenk		Well, if IDE's are bad for learning a language, why do people create them ?
2009-06-19T15:46:00.000Z	Jenk		Allright, could someone give his/her ideal way of learning C ?
2009-06-19T15:48:00.000Z	cyberghoser1	Jenk	Your brain is the best way trust me
2009-06-19T15:56:00.000Z	cyberghoser1	Jenk	yeah the brain is the most important thing
2009-06-19T15:57:00.000Z	Jenk	cyberghoser1	, yeah right ! btw, edubuntu would help ?
2009-06-19T15:59:00.000Z	cyberghoser1	Jenk	- of course
2009-06-19T15:59:00.000Z	Jenk	cyberghoser1	edubuntu would help learning C ?
2009-06-19T16:00:00.000Z	cyberghoser1	Jenk	- if you really want to learn C, C++ and other derivatives, the os choice is not the most important thing, you will start at command prompt, learn the compiler and the most important, the syntax
2009-06-19T16:01:00.000Z	Jenk	cyberghoser1	okay, and ?
2009-06-19T16:02:00.000Z	cyberghoser1	Jenk	- and? if you want to learn better start now :P
2009-06-19T16:03:00.000Z	Jenk	cyberghoser1	am taking ur advice and leaving...
