2010-06-26T04:30:00.000Z	IConrad01		Does anyone in this channel have a suggestion as to why uncommenting %sudo ALL=NOPASSWD: ALL would NOT enable no-password use of sudo?
2010-06-26T04:31:00.000Z	IConrad01		Using the method which is built-into the /etc/sudoers file.
2010-06-26T04:31:00.000Z	Viking667	IConrad01	that's pretty unsafe, of course
2010-06-26T04:31:00.000Z	IConrad01	Viking667	'course it is.
2010-06-26T04:49:00.000Z	Viking667	IConrad01	I don't even know if it hides them from you in GUI mode either, does it? Konqueror/Nautilus/Dolphin don't seem to.
2010-06-26T04:49:00.000Z	IConrad01	Viking667	Normally, no it doesn't.  But it *can*.
2010-06-26T04:52:00.000Z	IConrad01	Viking667	As long as they can talk to each other.
2010-06-26T04:54:00.000Z	IConrad01	Viking667	As I said -- I don't *think* it matters what ssh server you're working with.
2010-06-26T04:57:00.000Z	Viking667	IConrad01	(if something else hasn't decided it's going to use it)
2010-06-26T04:58:00.000Z	IConrad01	Viking667	sudo su - is my friend too.
2010-06-26T05:04:00.000Z	IConrad01	Viking667	:)
2010-06-26T05:26:00.000Z	IConrad01	Viking667	You just reminded me of how many times I destroyed my boot partition when setting up my multibooting USB drive.
2010-06-26T06:18:00.000Z	IConrad01	Viking667	It's in "other software"
2010-07-02T14:51:00.000Z	IConrad01	Viking667	I've got a multibooting USB drive with 3 *.iso files and memtest on it.
2010-07-02T14:51:00.000Z	IConrad01	Viking667	I'm trying to add PCRegedit to it.
2010-07-02T14:51:00.000Z	IConrad01	Viking667	It's a Linux-based LiveCD meant to correct Windows registries.
2010-07-02T14:53:00.000Z	IConrad01	Viking667	Ubuntu & Backtrack 4 I've already got booting.  It's just PCRegedit I'm after.
2010-07-02T14:53:00.000Z	Viking667	IConrad01	ugh. Nasty.
2010-07-02T14:54:00.000Z	IConrad01	Viking667	Doesn't hurt anything, happily.
