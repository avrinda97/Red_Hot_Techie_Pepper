2007-11-24T10:52:00.000Z	timi		the windows driver.
2007-11-24T10:53:00.000Z	timi		Kay, at the synaptic package manager
2007-11-24T10:53:00.000Z	timi		ismod: problem is, I can't find the correct driver.
2007-11-24T10:53:00.000Z	timi		I have ndiswrapper, I think
2007-11-24T10:54:00.000Z	timi		okay.
2007-11-24T10:55:00.000Z	timi		Cd?
2007-11-24T10:55:00.000Z	timi		I dont think there is a CD for the drivers.
2007-11-24T10:56:00.000Z	timi		FFS! it froze again.
2007-11-24T10:56:00.000Z	timi		is there any nice easy way to get it unfrozen?
2007-11-24T10:56:00.000Z	timi		without a hard reset?
2007-11-24T10:56:00.000Z	macogw	timi	what froze exactly?
2007-11-24T10:57:00.000Z	macogw	timi	the gui or everything?
2007-11-24T10:57:00.000Z	macogw	timi	can you hit ctrl alt backspace and restart X?
2007-11-24T10:58:00.000Z	macogw	timi	what about ctrl alt f1?
2007-11-24T11:05:00.000Z	macogw	timi	use gksu, not sudo
2007-11-24T11:10:00.000Z	macogw	timi	check the restricted driver manager
2007-11-24T11:10:00.000Z	macogw	timi	that card does NOT use ndiswrapper
2007-11-24T11:10:00.000Z	timi	macogw	I know, this is an alternate route.
2007-11-24T11:10:00.000Z	macogw	timi	it has binary firmware and daemon that are in the restricted modules and the restricted driver manager enables them
