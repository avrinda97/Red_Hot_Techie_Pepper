2010-10-12T04:03:00.000Z	robin0800	kb8wmc	just add lapic to /etc/default/grub
2010-10-12T04:04:00.000Z	kb8wmc		Robin0800, tnx already tried that, no joy
2010-10-12T04:05:00.000Z	robin0800	kb8wmc	you have then to run sudo update-grub and then reboot
2010-10-12T04:07:00.000Z	kb8wmc	robin0800	also ran "update-grub" which was successful, but still getting same error when invoking EMC2 in sim mode
2010-10-12T04:08:00.000Z	kb8wmc	robin0800	this is an IBM Thinkpad T22 if that is of use
2010-10-12T04:09:00.000Z	robin0800	kb8wmc	does the kernel log show apic disabled and then re-enabled
2010-10-12T04:10:00.000Z	kb8wmc	robin0800	will check
2010-10-12T04:12:00.000Z	kb8wmc		I just initiated EMC2 to get the error report which is as follows: "ERROR, LOCAL APIC CONFIGURED BUT NOT AVAILABLE/ENABLED"
2010-10-12T04:15:00.000Z	robin0800	kb8wmc	mine shows this http://paste.ubuntu.com/511213/
2010-10-12T04:16:00.000Z	kb8wmc	robin0800	tnx will check it out right now...bbiaf
2010-10-12T04:22:00.000Z	kb8wmc	robin0800	here is what is shows:  "Local APIC disabled by BIOS -- reenabling." ; "Could not enable APIC!." ;  "APIC. disable apic facility"
2010-10-12T04:23:00.000Z	robin0800	kb8wmc	perhaps you have a setting in bios
2010-10-12T04:23:00.000Z	kb8wmc	robin0800	I have looked all through the B
2010-10-12T04:24:00.000Z	kb8wmc	robin0800	Bios, but am not familiar with the BIOS in the T22...
2010-10-12T04:24:00.000Z	kb8wmc	robin0800	I may have went right over the proper setting without even knowing it
2010-10-12T04:24:00.000Z	robin0800	kb8wmc	nor me have a compaq nc6000 here
2010-10-12T04:26:00.000Z	kb8wmc	robin0800	thanks for you help....I will do some more searching on the net for this particular model and BIOS settings
2010-10-12T04:27:00.000Z	robin0800	kb8wmc	the lenvio forums might know about apic more than those here
2010-10-12T04:27:00.000Z	kb8wmc	robin0800	rgr that, will check, again tnx for help
