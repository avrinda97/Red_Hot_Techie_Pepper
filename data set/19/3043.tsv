2010-01-09T13:28:00.000Z	AgentHeX		i'm having a problem with firefox 3.5 in karmic.  i've lost the ability to right-click, and i cannot click the menus with the left button.  i can middle click links (right+left touchpad buttons), so i know the right button works.  i have deleted my .mozilla directory in order to reset settings, and this fixes the problem, but this is the second time this has happened, and i'd rather not lose all my login credentials whenever this problem comes u
2010-01-09T13:29:00.000Z	taofd	AgentHeX	are you using any weird addons?
2010-01-09T13:30:00.000Z	AgentHeX	taofd	not to my knowledge.  noscript and a couple others.  i can't look at the actual list because i can't click menus.
2010-01-09T13:30:00.000Z	taofd	AgentHeX	:(
2010-01-09T13:33:00.000Z	AgentHeX	taofd	i remember i use noscript and ReadItLater.  any known glitches with that, or might this be a firefox bug?

2010-01-09T13:34:00.000Z	taofd	AgentHeX	check this list? http://kb.mozillazine.org/Problematic_extensions
2010-01-09T13:35:00.000Z	taofd	AgentHeX	also check out this site: http://www.techgravy.net/2009/06/how-to-enable-right-click-function-in.html
2010-01-09T13:36:00.000Z	AgentHeX	taofd	no dice.  can't get into tools menu.
2010-01-09T13:36:00.000Z	AgentHeX	taofd	click doesn't work, alt+F combo doesn't work either.
2010-01-09T13:36:00.000Z	taofd	AgentHeX	mm... back up your .mozilla config folder, and wipe it?
2010-01-09T13:36:00.000Z	taofd	AgentHeX	then try installing one addon at a time, and using it for a while until you run into the problematic addon
2010-01-09T13:36:00.000Z	AgentHeX	taofd	did that.  problem temporarily fixed.
2010-01-09T13:37:00.000Z	taofd	AgentHeX	i'm suspicious that it is one of the addons... i don't think it's noscript
2010-01-09T13:37:00.000Z	AgentHeX	taofd	i'm on Facebook a lot, and i know it's very javascript intensive.  i'm wondering if maybe it doesn't play well with NoScript.
2010-01-09T13:38:00.000Z	taofd	AgentHeX	well... i use noscript... and use facebook though maybe not that much... it seems to work well for me? I've never had right click issues
2010-01-09T13:46:00.000Z	taofd	AgentHeX	but yeah, hopefully if you install an addon one at a time after a few days testing inbetween you can figure out which one it is...
2010-01-09T13:46:00.000Z	taofd	AgentHeX	good luck :D
2010-01-09T13:47:00.000Z	AgentHeX	taofd	thanks.  i reinstalled 9.10 on a new hard disk.  i'd never experienced on previous install of 9.10 and it hadn't happened until the new install.  i'll see if i can hunt down the reason.  thanks.
