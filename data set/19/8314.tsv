2008-01-06T17:13:00.000Z	th0r	WNxCryptic	there is quite a bit of info about vsftp on the web...try google
2008-01-06T17:14:00.000Z	th0r	WNxCryptic	and as I recall, it pretty much works out of the box, you don't need to change much in the config
2008-01-06T17:15:00.000Z	WNxCryptic	th0r	yes..that's what I thought too but I'm having permissions problems
2008-01-08T08:44:00.000Z	th0r	WNxCryptic	you should also be able to upload to directories under the user directory...but that is it. A security issue
2008-01-08T08:44:00.000Z	WNxCryptic	th0r	any work around? If not, how do I simply create a normal ftp user that has access to every directory?
2008-01-08T08:44:00.000Z	th0r	WNxCryptic	I don't have vsftpd installed, but as I recall there was an optiion like chroot-user or some such
2008-01-08T08:44:00.000Z	th0r	WNxCryptic	but what you want is very poor security and I would advise against it
2008-01-08T08:45:00.000Z	WNxCryptic	th0r	security is of very little concern.
2008-01-08T08:45:00.000Z	th0r	WNxCryptic	in the config...something along the lines of chroot user
2008-01-08T08:45:00.000Z	th0r	WNxCryptic	if you pastebin the config I will see if I can find it for you
2008-01-08T08:46:00.000Z	WNxCryptic	th0r	"chroot_local_user=YES" is commented out
2008-01-08T08:47:00.000Z	th0r	WNxCryptic	it is commented out because yes is the default. Take out the comment and change it to no...and remember you have to restart the server
2008-01-08T08:48:00.000Z	WNxCryptic	th0r	what's the directory for /init.d/ there's something before it..like SOMETHING/init.d/vsftpd restart
2008-01-08T08:48:00.000Z	th0r	WNxCryptic	/etc/init.d
2008-01-08T08:49:00.000Z	th0r	WNxCryptic	you may still run into issues since you need root permission to write to the entire tree
2008-01-08T08:49:00.000Z	th0r	WNxCryptic	there may also be a config entry for 'allow root login'
