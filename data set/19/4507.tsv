2012-06-02T21:07:00.000Z	smerz	gmachine_24	try the 12.04 live cd. see how it works in there
2012-06-02T21:07:00.000Z	smerz		new kernel, maybe better support for your wireless chip
2012-06-02T21:07:00.000Z	smerz	gmachine_24	could also be poor signal if you're far away from the AP
2012-06-02T21:07:00.000Z	gmachine_24	smerz	but it worked fine for a year
2012-06-02T21:07:00.000Z	smerz		hm
2012-06-02T21:07:00.000Z	gmachine_24		and the signal is strong
2012-06-02T21:08:00.000Z	smerz	gmachine_24	your neighbourhood didn't invade your wlan channel right?
2012-06-02T21:08:00.000Z	smerz		though unlikely the cause heh
2012-06-02T21:08:00.000Z	gmachine_24	smerz	no. but I thought of that. I tried different channels
2012-06-02T21:08:00.000Z	gmachine_24	smerz	the thing is the problem is only on this one laptop
2012-06-02T21:08:00.000Z	smerz	gmachine_24	60% of my neighbours are on the first channel hah
2012-06-02T21:08:00.000Z	smerz	gmachine_24	hmm i dunno then
2012-06-02T21:09:00.000Z	smerz		try disabling wlan power saving
2012-06-02T21:09:00.000Z	gmachine_24	smerz	ok
2012-06-02T21:09:00.000Z	smerz		that's an odd one though
2012-06-02T21:09:00.000Z	smerz		but it helped me on my campus wlan
2012-06-02T21:11:00.000Z	smerz	gmachine_24	"Power Management:off" when you run "iwconfig". can't recall how to disable it anymore :(
2012-06-02T21:12:00.000Z	gmachine_24	smerz	I just checked. Power management is already off.
2012-06-02T21:13:00.000Z	smerz	gmachine_24	which channel are you on, and which are your neighbours on?
