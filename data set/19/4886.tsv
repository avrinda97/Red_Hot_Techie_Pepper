2008-10-18T07:52:00.000Z	gluonman		I need help force mounting an external hard drive that my friend accidentally removed unsafely.
2008-10-18T07:52:00.000Z	After_Math	gluonman	did you try -f
2008-10-18T07:52:00.000Z	gluonman	After_Math	sudo mount -t ntfs-3g /dev/sdb1 /media/OneTouch4 -o force
2008-10-18T07:52:00.000Z	gluonman	After_Math	that's the code I tried to use.
2008-10-18T07:53:00.000Z	gluonman	After_Math	it fails.
2008-10-18T07:53:00.000Z	After_Math	gluonman	I see
2008-10-18T07:53:00.000Z	gluonman	After_Math	what's an alternative?
2008-10-18T07:53:00.000Z	After_Math	gluonman	that should work.Have you tried having the usb in while booting?
2008-10-18T07:53:00.000Z	gluonman	After_Math	no. I supposed I should try that.
2008-10-18T07:54:00.000Z	After_Math	gluonman	also
2008-10-18T07:54:00.000Z	After_Math	gluonman	/media/OneTouch4 is already created?
2008-10-18T07:54:00.000Z	gluonman	After_Math	I might not have created it properly.
2008-10-18T07:54:00.000Z	After_Math	gluonman	create the dir first
2008-10-18T07:54:00.000Z	After_Math	gluonman	what error are you exactly getting?
2008-10-18T07:55:00.000Z	gluonman	After_Math	hold on. I re-created the directory using sudo, which might have been my problem. let me try it again and I'll give you the output.
2008-10-18T07:55:00.000Z	After_Math	gluonman	ok
2008-10-18T07:55:00.000Z	gluonman	After_Math	funny how these things turn out to be simple little mistakes. It worked.
2008-10-18T07:56:00.000Z	After_Math	gluonman	haha tell me about it :) glad to see it works
2008-10-18T07:56:00.000Z	gluonman	After_Math	thanks for your attention. Laters.
