2005-06-26T09:27:00.000Z	j-rock	Amuro	ehh, normally
2005-06-26T09:27:00.000Z	j-rock	Amuro	what is the format of the download, tgz? rpm?
2005-06-26T09:28:00.000Z	j-rock	Amuro	usually programs are split up if have have libraries and such
2005-06-26T09:28:00.000Z	j-rock	Amuro	so its libraries might be in /usr/lib or /usr/local/lib
2005-06-26T09:28:00.000Z	j-rock	Amuro	while its binary (the executable) would be in /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin
2005-06-26T09:29:00.000Z	j-rock	Amuro	unless its decided that its totally none system software, where some sysadmins put them in /opt (for optional)
2005-06-26T09:32:00.000Z	j-rock	Amuro	you need to update
2005-06-26T09:33:00.000Z	j-rock	Amuro	open up a terminal, type 'sudo apt-get update' and then enter your own passwd
