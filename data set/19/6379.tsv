2008-01-29T00:00:00.000Z	bastones	DRebellion	Sorry for such a question but where would I find the model number? :P I tried looking on the USB adapter itself with no luck
2008-01-29T00:01:00.000Z	DRebellion	bastones	on mine its writen on the bottom of the box, on a barcode sticker
2008-01-29T00:03:00.000Z	DRebellion	bastones	not on mine
2008-01-29T00:04:00.000Z	DRebellion	bastones	ok, what have you tried so far?
2008-01-29T00:05:00.000Z	DRebellion	bastones	what is it?
2008-01-29T00:07:00.000Z	DRebellion	bastones	i have F5D7050uk
2008-01-29T00:08:00.000Z	DRebellion	bastones	it worked out of the box for me
2008-01-29T00:09:00.000Z	DRebellion	bastones	ok, i'll try and help you debug it
2008-01-29T00:09:00.000Z	DRebellion	bastones	can you describe in detail what you have tried so far?
2008-01-29T00:11:00.000Z	DRebellion	bastones	use system > administration > network to set up the options. are you using encryption?
2008-01-29T00:12:00.000Z	bastones	DRebellion	I am using an older version of Ubuntu which I'll update later on... is it the same one by going to sys configuration (under Computer) then Networking or Computer>network?
2008-01-29T00:13:00.000Z	DRebellion	bastones	i recommend you update to the latest ubuntu before trying anything as it may fix your problem to get the latest drivers etc.
2008-01-29T00:21:00.000Z	bastones	DRebellion	I can't update to the latest version as I havent got internet connection on my desktop as the wireless isn't working. I havent got any blank RW CDs... is there any other way to get the adapter working for my IC?
2008-01-29T00:21:00.000Z	DRebellion	bastones	are you running gutsy (7.10)?
2008-01-29T00:24:00.000Z	DRebellion	bastones	erm... i don't think anybody would be prepared to help you with your problems on such an old version, sorry. I recommend you buy some CD RWs and burn gutsy to a disk and install it.
2008-01-29T00:27:00.000Z	DRebellion	bastones	he's running 4.1. can't get wireless usb adapter to work. i told him to upgrade to 7.10 with a cd.
2008-01-29T00:52:00.000Z	DRebellion	bastones	I *strongly* recommend you burn gutsy (7.10) to a cd and do a clean install onto your computer.
