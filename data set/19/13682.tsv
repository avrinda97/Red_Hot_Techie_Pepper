2005-04-16T06:30:00.000Z	AgentM		Hello, does anybody know if the new Ubuntu Version will be released today?
2005-04-16T06:31:00.000Z	thoreauputic	AgentM	Friday I believe
2005-04-16T06:32:00.000Z	AgentM	thoreauputic	Thank you, but why so late? Today is the 5.04. ;)
2005-04-16T06:32:00.000Z	thoreauputic	AgentM	heheh - if this was Debian, you'd be waiting 'til next year at least ;-)
2005-04-16T06:33:00.000Z	thoreauputic	AgentM	that's  2005  04 BTW (April o5)
2005-04-16T06:35:00.000Z	AgentM	thoreauputic	That cannot be true, because the last release is named 4.10 ;) 2010? I don't think so! :)
2005-04-16T06:36:00.000Z	thoreauputic	AgentM	2004  10
2005-04-16T06:36:00.000Z	thoreauputic	AgentM	think about it
2005-04-16T06:36:00.000Z	AgentM	thoreauputic	Ok, my mistake, now I've got it
2005-04-16T06:36:00.000Z	thoreauputic	AgentM	:)
2005-04-16T06:37:00.000Z	AgentM		What do you think about the RC of Ubuntu 5.04? Is it very buggy?
2005-04-16T06:38:00.000Z	thoreauputic	AgentM	judging by the lack of problems reported here, solid
2005-04-16T06:39:00.000Z	AgentM		What what will be the difference to the stable version?
2005-04-16T06:39:00.000Z	thoreauputic	AgentM	xorg, gnome 2.10...
2005-04-16T06:40:00.000Z	thoreauputic	AgentM	lots of updated apps, xfce4.2 available in the repos... blah blah etc etc
2005-04-16T06:41:00.000Z	AgentM	thoreauputic	sorry, on my mind was the difference to the release candidate
2005-04-16T06:42:00.000Z	thoreauputic	AgentM	well, given that the release candidate was only a few days ago, not much
2005-04-16T06:43:00.000Z	thoreauputic	AgentM	and of course a dist-upgrade after Friday gets you the final Hoary
2005-04-16T06:43:00.000Z	AgentM	thoreauputic	So, I think I start downloading the RC :) thank you!
