2010-07-23T02:52:00.000Z	mreichelt		hi there
2010-07-23T02:53:00.000Z	mreichelt		I think I found a severe bug in Ubuntu 10.04, does anybody have a minute to check if it occurs for him, too?
2010-07-23T02:54:00.000Z	dominicdinada	mreichelt	what is the bug ?
2010-07-23T02:55:00.000Z	mreichelt	dominicdinada	can you confirm this?
2010-07-23T02:57:00.000Z	dominicdinada	mreichelt	it did not work on mine let me try again
2010-07-23T02:57:00.000Z	mreichelt	dominicdinada	do you have graphic effects enabled?
2010-07-23T02:57:00.000Z	dominicdinada	mreichelt	did you update your ubuntu recently
2010-07-23T02:57:00.000Z	dominicdinada	mreichelt	mine are disabled as well
2010-07-23T02:59:00.000Z	dominicdinada	mreichelt	Actually you are right i miss read it when i did it if i click close my home folder it does close the terminal
2010-07-23T03:00:00.000Z	dominicdinada	mreichelt	good find ...
2010-07-23T03:04:00.000Z	mreichelt	dominicdinada	do you think this bug is related to metacity?
2010-07-23T03:07:00.000Z	dominicdinada	mreichelt	I am not sure i would ask someone with more knowledge, but wouldnt it be something with the compiz  ?
2010-07-23T03:08:00.000Z	mreichelt	dominicdinada	I don't think so, because compiz is deactivated
2010-07-23T03:09:00.000Z	dominicdinada	mreichelt	even with the compiz effects turned off it still runs in the background i believe
2010-07-23T03:12:00.000Z	dominicdinada	mreichelt	my compiz used to run in the background however i do not see it running anymore so it could be a metacity
2010-07-23T03:14:00.000Z	mreichelt	dominicdinada	ok, so I don't need to file this bug :)
2010-07-23T03:16:00.000Z	mreichelt	dominicdinada	& alkisg: do you think it would make sense to file this bug in launchpad, too?
2010-07-23T03:17:00.000Z	dominicdinada	mreichelt	it has been a bug for a year now apparently :/ back to karmic atleast
2010-07-23T03:18:00.000Z	dominicdinada	mreichelt	https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=599181 here is one from almost a year ago...
