2007-03-18T10:32:00.000Z	shark-1		anyone know what is wrong with yorans comp?
2007-03-18T10:34:00.000Z	yoran	shark-1	just did apt-get update and then apt-get upgrade
2007-03-18T10:34:00.000Z	shark-1	yoran	hmm i think for awhile i was experiencing this have you considered upgrading to edgy?
2007-03-18T10:34:00.000Z	yoran	shark-1	no not yet but i think that if the problem persits then i will
2007-03-18T10:35:00.000Z	shark-1	yoran	what i would suggest is if you cant get it to work you could try to reinstall with a newer cd by burning the dapper ISO or try upgrading to edgy
2007-03-18T10:36:00.000Z	yoran	shark-1	okay and if i choose to upgrade to edgy, do i have to reinstall everything?
2007-03-18T10:36:00.000Z	yoran	shark-1	edgy is that ubuntu 6.10?
2007-03-18T10:37:00.000Z	shark-1	yoran	currently your dapper works correct? just in recovery mode?
2007-03-18T10:37:00.000Z	shark-1	yoran	yes its 6.10
2007-03-18T10:37:00.000Z	yoran	shark-1	yeah it works fine in recovery mode
2007-03-18T10:38:00.000Z	yoran	shark-1	when i download edgy, does it work the same as dapper drake? is it a live cd?
2007-03-18T10:38:00.000Z	shark-1	yoran	another thing you could try is to install the upgrades through update manager
2007-03-18T10:38:00.000Z	shark-1	yoran	yes its a live cd or you could just upgrade your computer right now to edgy
2007-03-18T10:39:00.000Z	yoran	shark-1	ok update manager is that the graphical update thing?
2007-03-18T10:39:00.000Z	shark-1		yes
2007-03-18T10:40:00.000Z	shark-1		i think LTS is every other version
2007-03-18T10:40:00.000Z	shark-1		oh
2007-03-18T10:42:00.000Z	yoran	shark-1	is it normal that that iso is 0 bytes????
2007-03-18T10:42:00.000Z	shark-1	yoran	no
