2005-01-02T12:19:00.000Z	drspin		I'm getting ready to try out ubuntu and if I like it I'll install it today...
2005-01-02T12:19:00.000Z	mojo_	drspin	- yeah, i just got this installed yesterday
2005-01-02T12:39:00.000Z	mojo_	drspin	you mean seraila ata?  i am not sure.  my sata drive appears as a scsi interface on ubuntu
2005-01-02T13:38:00.000Z	drspin	mojo_	it's because the frequencies that are removed from say an OGG file are very different than those from an MP3 file
2005-01-02T13:39:00.000Z	mojo_	drspin	yeah, i know (but thx).  it's just a shame thats all.  if i could, i'd just conv. them all and be done with mp3s
2005-01-02T13:44:00.000Z	mojo_	drspin	so i just man fstab and go from there?
2005-02-06T17:31:00.000Z	mojo_	drspin	your laptop won't boot?  that sux
2005-02-06T17:32:00.000Z	drspin	mojo_	yeah -- I need a Mac OS 9.0 or earlier CD -- have to use BootX -- I was trying to edit the partitions... and I borked it...
2005-02-06T17:33:00.000Z	mojo_	drspin	ugh.  so you have an ibook then?
2005-02-06T17:33:00.000Z	drspin	mojo_	Powerbook 3500c
2005-02-06T17:33:00.000Z	mojo_	drspin	i gotta admit i like the osx macs, but they're still a bit pricey
2005-02-06T17:33:00.000Z	drspin	mojo_	I use it for remote X sessions
2005-02-06T17:33:00.000Z	mojo_	drspin	powerbook newer or older than ibooks?
2005-02-06T17:34:00.000Z	drspin	mojo_	uhm... this laptop came out right before the G3 (or perhaps the one right before the G3)
2005-02-06T17:35:00.000Z	mojo_	drspin	i wsn't up on apple for a while there but have been looking at them.  the mini is, imho, a product with some potential.  still pricey vs a pee cee but u can upgrade the hd and ram urself w/ laptop hdd and pc ram no prob
2005-02-06T17:36:00.000Z	mojo_	drspin	methinks a low-price mac that is descent for computernewbies (which mac has always been good at, imho) may have a market
2005-02-06T17:38:00.000Z	mojo_	drspin	re MS - all things must pass... IBM had a nice monopoly there at one time... or, well, dominant position, anyway
2005-02-06T17:39:00.000Z	drspin	mojo_	indeed --
2005-02-06T17:40:00.000Z	mojo_	drspin	I think xbox is smart for MS considering what I see as focus... Bill always goes for the bottleneck and tries to control it.  UI/OS between users/ app vendors.  now going for console gives chance to control it if/when that goes set-top.
