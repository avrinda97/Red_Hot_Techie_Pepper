2010-05-18T21:00:00.000Z	miazgator		I need help with flashplayer's fullscreen performance, it's only perfect with Konqueror on my Kubuntu, and I need to find a fix for Ubuntu (I don't want Konq in Gnome
2010-05-18T21:00:00.000Z	miazgator		the controls are lagged a bit
2010-05-18T21:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	miazgator	is your ubuntu 64bit?
2010-05-18T21:06:00.000Z	miazgator	ActionParsnip	no it's 32bit this time, because 64bit makes no sense unless 4gb ram
2010-05-18T21:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	miazgator	it can be beneficial with audio / video encoding decoding, even on <4Gb ram
2010-05-18T21:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	miazgator	what video card do you have?
2010-05-18T21:07:00.000Z	miazgator	ActionParsnip	I need help to get gnome+flash on youtube to work fluently, KDE's Konqueror handles it perfectly
2010-05-18T21:07:00.000Z	miazgator	ActionParsnip	GF 7800GT
2010-05-18T21:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	miazgator	ok then i can suggest you grab the 10.1 beta plugin and put the .so file in your browsers plugins folder, remove the current flash packages to prevent conflicts
2010-05-18T21:08:00.000Z	miazgator	ActionParsnip	tried that with worse resoults than current stable
2010-05-18T21:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	miazgator	what video driver are you running?
2010-05-18T21:09:00.000Z	miazgator	ActionParsnip	195 from repos (10.04)
2010-05-18T21:09:00.000Z	miazgator	ActionParsnip	already tried if that's a compiz or metacity thing, same performance
2010-05-18T21:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	miazgator	you could try chromium browser, its a whole lot slicker than firefox, mind you vegemite is slicker
2010-05-18T21:10:00.000Z	miazgator	ActionParsnip	same performance on Chromium, I would even say FF 3.6.3 is better
2010-05-18T21:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	miazgator	tried the mozilla ppa?
2010-05-18T21:10:00.000Z	miazgator	ActionParsnip	no
2010-05-18T21:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	miazgator	its a later build of firefox and may help
2010-05-18T21:11:00.000Z	miazgator	ActionParsnip	so I'll try it out
