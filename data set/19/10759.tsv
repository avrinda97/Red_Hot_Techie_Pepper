2007-02-19T08:25:00.000Z	joh		Isn't there NTFS write-support on the LiveCDs?
2007-02-19T08:25:00.000Z	ikonia_	joh	no
2007-02-19T08:26:00.000Z	joh	ikonia_	Any idea how to get it working on a livecd?
2007-02-19T08:26:00.000Z	ikonia_	joh	install and configure it
2007-02-19T08:27:00.000Z	joh	ikonia_	install ubuntu or install ntfs support on the livecd?
2007-02-19T08:27:00.000Z	ikonia_	joh	ntfs write support
2007-02-19T08:27:00.000Z	joh	ikonia_	Ok, the ntfs-3g package?
2007-02-19T08:27:00.000Z	ikonia_	joh	thats part of it
2007-02-19T08:28:00.000Z	joh	ikonia_	Ok thanks
2007-02-19T08:57:00.000Z	ikonia_	joh	that the link is not ready
2007-02-19T08:57:00.000Z	joh	ikonia_	And why isn't it? :P
2007-02-19T08:58:00.000Z	ikonia_	joh	probably not recognised, or no ip, or no cable in it etc etc- the list is long
2007-02-19T08:58:00.000Z	joh	ikonia_	It's a wireless interface...
2007-02-19T08:58:00.000Z	joh	ikonia_	And I've given it an IP manually
2007-02-19T08:58:00.000Z	ikonia_	joh	ok - so same answers - but without the cable
2007-02-19T08:58:00.000Z	joh	ikonia_	How should I debug this further?
2007-02-19T08:58:00.000Z	ikonia_	joh	check the syslog
2007-02-19T09:00:00.000Z	joh	ikonia_	that's all it says, that line with link is not ready
2007-02-19T09:03:00.000Z	joh	ikonia_	Figured it out :) there was a userspace daemon which needed to run for the network card *after* you've enabled the interface.
