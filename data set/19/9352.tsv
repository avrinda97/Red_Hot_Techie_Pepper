2007-05-26T16:31:00.000Z	pietro10		So there isn't any difference between installing via hard drive and via USB?
2007-05-26T16:31:00.000Z	pietro10		OK
2007-05-26T16:31:00.000Z	pietro10		Thanks a lot
2007-05-26T16:31:00.000Z	pietro10		I'm off to do the dirty work
2007-05-26T16:31:00.000Z	pietro10		Bye
2007-05-26T07:33:00.000Z	pietro10		Hello. I have a question about the Ubuntu installer.
2007-05-26T07:34:00.000Z	pietro10		When I did a test install of the normal Ubuntu, the GUI installer only let me install to my computer's main hard drive, not to a USB drive
2007-05-26T07:34:00.000Z	pietro10		Does the text installer suffer that problem too?
2007-05-26T07:34:00.000Z	Slart	pietro10	I don't think you can boot from a usb drive.. I might be wrong though.. just a guess
2007-05-26T07:34:00.000Z	pietro10		Yes you can
2007-05-26T07:35:00.000Z	pietro10		I was once at the Mac genius bar and he helped me by booting off a dual-format USB drive with Mac OS X on it
2007-05-26T07:35:00.000Z	Slart	pietro10	oh? I thought the usb mount thingy comes way after anything else in the boot process
2007-05-26T07:35:00.000Z	pietro10		(Dual format = Partition 1:
2007-05-26T07:35:00.000Z	pietro10		Intel, Partition 2: PowerPC)
2007-05-26T07:35:00.000Z	pietro10		My system is a Mac, it boots off of EFI
2007-05-26T07:36:00.000Z	pietro10	rem	do a Synaptic search for QuickTime
2007-05-26T07:36:00.000Z	Slart	pietro10	ok.. then I don't know.. sorry
2007-05-26T07:36:00.000Z	pietro10		ok
2007-05-26T07:37:00.000Z	Slart	pietro10	might be some info here http://librenix.com/?inode=8163
