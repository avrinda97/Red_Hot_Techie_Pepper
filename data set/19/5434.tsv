2008-12-31T02:48:00.000Z	jdolan		can anyone recommend a sound editor besides Audacity?
2008-12-31T02:48:00.000Z	jdolan		i get no sound output from Audacity.
2008-12-31T02:50:00.000Z	jdolan		and i have sound in Flash, Rhythmbox, and games.
2008-12-31T02:51:00.000Z	jdolan		again, Flash, Rhythmbox, all games i have tried, etc..
2008-12-31T02:52:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	jdolan	There is a recent build of Audacity that supports the ALSA plugin for pulse properly
2008-12-31T02:52:00.000Z	jdolan	WebcamWonder	is there a .deb available or should i just build it?
2008-12-31T02:52:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	jdolan	Hold on

2008-12-31T02:54:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	jdolan	Your problem is a known problem from Audacity. You can, 1) Try the repo above, 2) Try the OSS wrapper from PulseAudio
2008-12-31T02:55:00.000Z	jdolan	WebcamWonder	i just want to install that ppa .deb?
2008-12-31T02:55:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	jdolan	Just add it to your sources... And it should update the audacity version
2008-12-31T02:56:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	jdolan	PA in 8.04 WAS Ubuntu's fault
2008-12-31T02:56:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	jdolan	It was perfectly stable back then as well, but Ubuntu never provided the correct plugins/packages for it
2008-12-31T02:56:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	jdolan	I have PERFECT audio under 8.04 using the correct fixes
2008-12-31T02:58:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	jdolan	No problem
2008-12-31T03:01:00.000Z	jdolan	WebcamWonder	works -- thanks again!
2008-12-31T03:01:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	jdolan	The repo?
2008-12-31T03:02:00.000Z	jdolan	WebcamWonder	i fetched the .deb and installed it manually.
2008-12-31T03:02:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	jdolan	Ahh got it. No problems... Glad a noob like me could help :)
