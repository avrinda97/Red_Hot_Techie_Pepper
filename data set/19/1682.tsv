2011-05-17T21:35:00.000Z	robin0800	roasted	mount your share in fstab then
2011-05-17T21:35:00.000Z	roasted	robin0800	CIFS and fstab don't play nice.
2011-05-17T21:36:00.000Z	robin0800	roasted	they work alright for me
2011-05-17T21:36:00.000Z	roasted	robin0800	really? can you show me your fstab?

2011-10-24T05:36:00.000Z	robin0800	roasted	have you purged all fglrx drivers an the kernel patch and all the rest ?
2011-10-24T05:36:00.000Z	roasted	robin0800	honestly, I'm not even sure. :(
2011-10-24T05:37:00.000Z	roasted	robin0800	I just want to get back where I Was before the proprietary drivers were installed.
2011-10-24T05:39:00.000Z	robin0800	roasted	well you can use symatic to completely remove everything that was installed
2011-10-24T05:39:00.000Z	roasted	robin0800	what is it I need to remove, exactly? anything fglrx related?
2011-10-24T05:41:00.000Z	robin0800	roasted	yes i think there is three bits how did you install by the way
2011-10-24T05:42:00.000Z	roasted	robin0800	I just installed through the hardware manager. Then I removed it. I was told if the proprietary driver isnt present then the open source ne would automatically take over
2011-10-24T05:43:00.000Z	robin0800	roasted	but it hasn't has it
2011-10-24T05:43:00.000Z	roasted	robin0800	no not at all
2011-10-24T05:46:00.000Z	robin0800	roasted	perhaps synaptic pretend to install it again and note what files it would install
2011-10-24T05:46:00.000Z	roasted	robin0800	rebooting now. This time I got an updating initramfs entry and said to reboot in term, so Im rebooting now
2011-10-24T05:46:00.000Z	roasted	robin0800	hope this fixes it...
2011-10-24T05:47:00.000Z	roasted	robin0800	Matisse, GOT IT!
