2011-02-05T09:07:00.000Z	virtus		=/ I need to intall glib2.5 or higher, but apparently the highest glib is 2.26 via the repos?
2011-02-05T09:07:00.000Z	virtus		Or, atleast, when going apt-get install libglib2.0
2011-02-05T09:07:00.000Z	virtus		Please tell me you're not THAT far behind
2011-02-05T09:09:00.000Z	virtus		Jesus christ =/
2011-02-05T09:09:00.000Z	virtus		It's like dependancy hell INSIDE UBUNTU
2011-02-05T09:09:00.000Z	virtus		Apparently it needs glib-2.0 -- When I have 2.26
2011-02-05T09:10:00.000Z	jrib	virtus	you're doing it wrong
2011-02-05T09:10:00.000Z	virtus	jrib	Of course I am.
2011-02-05T09:10:00.000Z	jrib	virtus	start from the beginning.  Why do you think you need this version of glib?
2011-02-05T09:10:00.000Z	virtus	jrib	For screem. -- A editor.
2011-02-05T09:13:00.000Z	jrib	virtus	you need -dev packages to compile things
2011-02-05T09:14:00.000Z	virtus	jrib	Why? That sounds very inconvenient
2011-02-05T09:14:00.000Z	jrib	virtus	erm, because users do not usually need to compile things
2011-02-05T09:14:00.000Z	jrib	virtus	what do you have exactly?
2011-02-05T09:15:00.000Z	jrib	virtus	then tell your configure script to stop being silly?
2011-02-05T09:15:00.000Z	virtus	jrib	Wish I could. 'Tis bein' very rude.
2011-02-05T09:28:00.000Z	jrib	virtus	packages seems old.  Actually seems to have been packaged in debian and now gone.  You can try to fetch the source package from debian but it seems like deps are just gone now (like libgtkhtml-2.0)
2011-02-05T09:28:00.000Z	jrib	virtus	s/packages/screem
2011-02-05T09:29:00.000Z	jrib	virtus	see, made it into older ubuntu: http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=screem&searchon=names&suite=all&section=all
