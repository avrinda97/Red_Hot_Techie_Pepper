2006-08-27T12:59:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Crazed	you need to add the AddType line for .cgi, or enable cgi-bin for your default site. Read the README file in /etc/apache2
2006-08-27T13:06:00.000Z	Crazed	fyrestrtr	addtype doesnt work ?
2006-08-27T13:06:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Crazed	are you asking me or telling me?
2006-08-27T13:06:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Crazed	what did you add, and where did you add it?
2006-08-27T13:07:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Crazed	hrmm, I think you need the cgi-handler for .pl files, I don't know the exact line, try asking in #perl
2006-08-27T13:08:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Crazed	add .pl to the end of it .cgi .pl
2006-08-27T13:08:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Crazed	did you restart apache?
2006-08-27T13:09:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Crazed	'You have reached the end of the line for the fyrestrtr help train on track Perl. For more information, refer to the train leaving in 5 minutes on platform #perl. Thank you for traveling, and have a good day.'
