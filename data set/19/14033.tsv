2004-11-16T17:05:00.000Z	Matt|		if so, stick in the WEP code
2004-11-16T17:06:00.000Z	janice	Matt|	No, WEP.
2004-11-15T16:37:00.000Z	Matt|	janice	yeah i think so too
2004-11-15T16:40:00.000Z	Matt|	janice	have a look and see!
2004-11-15T16:42:00.000Z	janice	Matt|	Thank you for the reply. I have followed the steps but when I get to step #6 and view the etc/network/interfaces all there is, is only the first two lines, but not all the specific stuff.
2004-11-15T16:43:00.000Z	Matt|	janice	ok i guess you have to add it
2004-11-15T16:43:00.000Z	janice	Matt|	What I mean by specific stuff are: address, netmask,broadcast, etc.
2004-11-15T16:44:00.000Z	Matt|	janice	you are not using dhcp?
2004-11-15T16:49:00.000Z	janice	Matt|	Yes, I am using dhcp. Do you have a suggestion?
2004-11-15T16:50:00.000Z	Matt|	janice	ok then you don't need all those details!
2004-11-15T16:50:00.000Z	Matt|	janice	mine says:
2004-11-15T16:50:00.000Z	janice	Matt|	Which detail do I need? ESSID? Anything else?
2004-11-15T16:51:00.000Z	janice	Matt|	Is that it?
2004-11-15T16:52:00.000Z	janice	Matt|	Don't I need to specify the gateway?
2004-11-15T16:53:00.000Z	Matt|	janice	no should be fine
2004-11-16T17:00:00.000Z	janice	Matt|	I don't have connectivity yet, although the wireless option does appear in the Network settings | connectivity window. I suspect I don't have connectivity because I did not specify a channel. Where do I specify a channel for the wireless?
2004-11-16T17:03:00.000Z	Matt|	janice	i did not need to specify a channel
2004-11-16T17:03:00.000Z	Matt|	janice	it seemed to detect it automatically
2004-11-16T17:05:00.000Z	Matt|	janice	do you have WEP activated on the router?
