2007-03-08T15:29:00.000Z	OMGLAZERS		Anyone know a good ghosting program to back up a partition so in case I nuke one I can just restore the other?

2007-03-08T15:30:00.000Z	OMGLAZERS	gnube	When I meant nuked, I mean, I screw it up, rather than physical damage. I dont need a RAID 1
2007-03-08T15:30:00.000Z	gnube	OMGLAZERS	Okidoki.  =)
2007-03-08T15:31:00.000Z	OMGLAZERS	gnube	Any other suggestions for me? :\
2007-03-08T15:31:00.000Z	gnube	OMGLAZERS	What is wrong with tar?
2007-03-08T15:31:00.000Z	gnube	OMGLAZERS	Or pax?
2007-03-08T15:31:00.000Z	OMGLAZERS	gnube	Nothing; I don't even know what those are. :P
2007-03-08T15:32:00.000Z	gnube	OMGLAZERS	Oh I see. Use tar, it is an archive tool, very good, everyone uses it.
2007-03-08T15:32:00.000Z	OMGLAZERS	gnube	Im a newbie. I'm in ubuntu for a reason. I've nuked a few installations in the past week by screwing around and I want to know how to ghost backup a partition, so in case I screw it up again, I can just restore it with all my settings rather than having to reinstall
2007-03-08T15:32:00.000Z	OMGLAZERS	gnube	Thanks. Ill google it.
2007-03-08T15:32:00.000Z	gnube	OMGLAZERS	You use it like this, tar cf new.tar directory_you_want_to_back_up
2007-03-08T15:33:00.000Z	gnube	OMGLAZERS	Try this, it is faster than GOogle. man tar
2007-03-08T15:33:00.000Z	OMGLAZERS	gnube	Well I meant I'd like to read up on it. I just want to make sure I know what im doing. I didnt know if there's any gui type deal like Norton has 'Norton Ghost' or such
2007-03-08T15:34:00.000Z	OMGLAZERS	gnube	I really want to make sure I dont screw it up again
2007-03-08T15:34:00.000Z	gnube	OMGLAZERS	Yeah, there are GUI type deals, unforntunately I do not use them, sorry.
2007-03-08T15:35:00.000Z	OMGLAZERS	gnube	Ill google the tar command and maybe look for something else. Thanks for the help :)
2007-03-08T15:35:00.000Z	gnube	OMGLAZERS	You are very welcome! :) And good luck.
