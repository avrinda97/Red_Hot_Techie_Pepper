2010-11-17T00:56:00.000Z	jymere		as a result I have no open hubs ( port i don't know the exactly term in english)
2010-11-17T00:56:00.000Z	jymere		si i want to open tcp port and I add: pass in proto tcp to any port // pass out proto tcp to any port
2010-11-17T00:57:00.000Z	jymere		no it's juste for fun
2010-11-17T00:57:00.000Z	karlw	jymere	You mean like telnet?
2010-11-17T00:58:00.000Z	jymere	karlw	that's the point
2010-11-17T00:58:00.000Z	karlw	jymere	Try using Python's TCP library.
2010-11-17T00:59:00.000Z	jymere		i want to open my http port and i want to know which rules i have to add
2010-11-17T00:59:00.000Z	karlw	jymere	Have you installed Apache?
2010-11-17T00:59:00.000Z	jymere		in fact i have to open the 80 port
2010-11-17T01:00:00.000Z	jymere		no it's on my computer home
2010-11-17T01:00:00.000Z	karlw	jymere	Run an HTTP server socket that listens on port 80.
2010-11-17T01:00:00.000Z	jymere		so I add: pass in proto http 80
2010-11-17T01:01:00.000Z	jymere		but it doesn't work
2010-11-17T01:01:00.000Z	jymere		well it's too dicificult to explain in live i'll create a new topic it'll be clear
2010-11-17T01:02:00.000Z	karlw	jymere	Perhaps we could sort this out easier through private messages.
2010-11-17T01:02:00.000Z	karlw	jymere	May I msg you?
2010-11-17T01:03:00.000Z	jymere	karlw	no thanks I'll post a new topic
