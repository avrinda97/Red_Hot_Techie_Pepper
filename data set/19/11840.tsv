2007-05-28T14:36:00.000Z	Stoffer		can someone please take a look at the tail end of the "make" output and tell me what I'm missing?  http://pastebin.ca/516711
2007-05-28T14:37:00.000Z	LjL	Stoffer	depending on whether that's a Qt3 or Qt4 program, i suppose you might want to try installing one of those.
2007-05-28T14:38:00.000Z	Stoffer	LjL	erUSUL thanks, I'll try those
2007-05-28T14:47:00.000Z	Stoffer	LjL	installing those packages didn't work... I thought maybe assigning QTDIR to /usr/lib/qt3 may have caued this problem, but I couldn't find any qt4 directory
2007-05-28T14:47:00.000Z	Stoffer	LjL	locate qpixmap.h after installing those packages didn't turn anything up either
2007-05-28T14:48:00.000Z	LjL	Stoffer	the locate database is updated daily, not in real time
2007-05-28T14:48:00.000Z	Stoffer	LjL	can I update it manually?
2007-05-28T14:48:00.000Z	LjL	Stoffer	try "dpkg -L <packagename>" to see where the files ended up
2007-05-28T14:49:00.000Z	Stoffer	LjL	those headers probably ended up in /usr/include/qt4 then... I should redo ./configure with that location for QTDIR?
2007-05-28T14:50:00.000Z	LjL	Stoffer	possibly, do you positively know it's qt4 that the program wants though?
2007-05-28T14:50:00.000Z	Stoffer	LjL	no
2007-05-28T14:50:00.000Z	Stoffer	LjL	but nothing else is working ... it's pdfedit, btw
2007-05-28T14:50:00.000Z	LjL	Stoffer	then find out first, before wasting more time. README or INSTALL should definitely mention that
2007-05-28T14:51:00.000Z	Stoffer	LjL	I read both, it doesn't mention which version of QT they want.... and I just tried redoing ./configure w/ the new directory... make still didn't work
2007-05-28T14:51:00.000Z	Stoffer	LjL	actually no, I reread it, and it says qt3
2007-05-28T14:52:00.000Z	Stoffer	LjL	but I made sure I had all of what they said to have
2007-05-28T14:53:00.000Z	Stoffer	LjL	all the libraries and headers for qt3, boost and xlib
2007-05-28T14:53:00.000Z	LjL	Stoffer	you could try installing "kde-devel", that's about the most comprehensive KDE/Qt related package. but there might actually be an issue in the autoconf, seeing http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=340011 and http://pdfedit.petricek.net/bt/view.php?id=146
2007-05-28T14:57:00.000Z	Stoffer	LjL	I played around with it a bit, setting QTDIR again with the 'make' command...and it seems to be doing something
