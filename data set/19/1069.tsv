2011-05-30T00:08:00.000Z	sudokill	BKTech86	it shouldnt, it shoud only mean connecting to net or not
2011-05-30T00:08:00.000Z	BKTech86	sudokill	it's a laptop I can't open it up right now
2011-05-30T00:09:00.000Z	sudokill	BKTech86	i dont even know how far u r in installer
2011-05-30T00:09:00.000Z	sudokill	BKTech86	so it is the wireless then
2011-05-30T00:09:00.000Z	BKTech86	sudokill	you know when you boot up and u see the davinci symbol
2011-05-30T00:09:00.000Z	sudokill	BKTech86	can u get into the livecd or not?
2011-05-30T00:09:00.000Z	BKTech86	sudokill	i hit enter, English, Install ubuntu, it says 11.04
2011-05-30T00:10:00.000Z	sudokill	BKTech86	boot into the livecd and do the wifi driver thing
2011-05-30T00:11:00.000Z	BKTech86	sudokill	when the error happens, I don't have a chance to do anything
2011-05-30T00:11:00.000Z	sudokill	BKTech86	i thought it only errored on the installer?
2011-05-30T00:20:00.000Z	sudokill	BKTech86	boot into it as usual and install it
2011-05-30T00:21:00.000Z	BKTech86	sudokill	but it wont let me get fully into live boot
2011-05-30T00:21:00.000Z	sudokill	BKTech86	i thought u got as far as the installer?
2011-05-30T00:21:00.000Z	BKTech86	sudokill	no i got the main menu wher eyou have the options : check disk, install ubuntu, etc.  I select install ubuntu -> crash
