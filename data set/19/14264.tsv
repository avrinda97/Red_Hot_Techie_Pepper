2005-02-23T07:51:00.000Z	SeanQ		...
2005-02-23T07:51:00.000Z	SeanQ		What?
2005-02-23T07:53:00.000Z	SeanQ		Which would be..?
2005-02-23T07:55:00.000Z	SeanQ		Hm. Okay.
2005-02-23T07:56:00.000Z	SeanQ		Are there any good "post-install" guides..
2005-02-23T07:56:00.000Z	SeanQ		literally like what I should do after install?
2005-02-23T07:57:00.000Z	SeanQ		Is the Live CD like Knoppix in the extent that it's the whole distro on CD?
2005-02-23T07:58:00.000Z	SeanQ		And another thing holding me back is this 'Fedora Core 3 For Dummies' right next to me
2005-02-23T07:59:00.000Z	SeanQ		I'll go for it. :P
2005-02-23T08:00:00.000Z	SeanQ		Wait, you DO have mplayer in Ubuntu, correct?
2005-02-23T08:00:00.000Z	Tsjoklat	SeanQ	you won't regret it.. it all depends on what you would like though... warty if you want stable.. hoary if you are courageous
2005-02-23T08:01:00.000Z	Tsjoklat	SeanQ	I'm using totem-xine plus the codecs from merilat and it works great
2005-02-23T08:02:00.000Z	Tsjoklat	SeanQ	totem-gstreamer was a no-go for me
2005-02-23T08:04:00.000Z	Tsjoklat	SeanQ	there is a guide on the wiki to downgrade but I wouldn't do it... I tried several times on my testbox and again no-go
2005-02-23T08:05:00.000Z	Tsjoklat	SeanQ	but you can always use Warty with backporting
2005-02-23T08:05:00.000Z	Tsjoklat	SeanQ	yes.. that means you run warty but with certain progs from hoary
2005-02-23T08:06:00.000Z	Tsjoklat	SeanQ	but again.. I wouldn't recommend it lol
2005-02-23T08:06:00.000Z	Tsjoklat	SeanQ	it is good that you ask all those questions though :)
2005-02-23T08:09:00.000Z	Tsjoklat	SeanQ	yes
