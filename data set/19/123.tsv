2012-08-28T06:30:00.000Z	Zeptis		I know ubottu knows how to school me in nVidia, but software center is borked, so I can't use their method, and the nVidia *.run is "Unable to determine the version of the kernel sources located in '/lib/modules/3.2.0-29-generic/build'."

2012-08-28T06:32:00.000Z	jrib	Zeptis	how is software center borked?
2012-08-28T06:33:00.000Z	Zeptis		well, whenever I try to click something to install/uninstall, nothing happens in the shell and the output in CLI is "softwarecenter.backend - WARNING - _on_trans_error: org.freedesktop.PolicyKit.Error.Failed: ('system-bus-name', {'name':  ':1.26'}): org.debian.apt.install-or-remove-packages"

2012-08-28T06:34:00.000Z	jrib	Zeptis	if you close software center, does apt-get work ok in a terminal?
2012-08-28T06:34:00.000Z	Zeptis	jrib	yes it does, for the most part
2012-08-28T06:35:00.000Z	jrib	Zeptis	"for the most part"?
2012-08-28T06:35:00.000Z	Zeptis	jrib	the bug you directed me to is an example
2012-08-28T06:35:00.000Z	jrib	Zeptis	is that the only example?
2012-08-28T06:35:00.000Z	Zeptis		pretty much, jrib
2012-08-28T06:36:00.000Z	Zeptis		how does Software center need freedesktop?
2012-08-28T06:36:00.000Z	jrib	Zeptis	what are you trying to accomplish now?  Getting drivers for your video card or something else?
2012-08-28T06:37:00.000Z	Zeptis	jrib	getting drivers for my video card so X doesn't default to intel
2012-08-28T06:37:00.000Z	jrib	Zeptis	does « jockey-gtk » offer anything?
2012-08-28T06:39:00.000Z	Zeptis	jrib	you're awesome. Thanks for knowing that daemon's name.
2012-08-28T06:40:00.000Z	jrib	Zeptis	it's "Additional Drivers", "Hardware Drivers", "Restricted Drivers", or something like that in one of the menus
