2006-10-07T08:55:00.000Z	efrancolaporte		im wondering if theres something on my motherboard that would make it reject non-emachines PSUs since my computer is a pre-built emachines
2006-10-07T08:56:00.000Z	efrancolaporte		no, the PSU is fanless
2006-10-07T08:56:00.000Z	efrancolaporte		it's an Antec Phantom 350
2006-10-07T08:56:00.000Z	efrancolaporte		lol thats why i bought it
2006-10-07T08:56:00.000Z	efrancolaporte		but it doent start!!!! :'( sniff
2006-10-07T08:57:00.000Z	efrancolaporte		you mean a fan connected to the MB?
2006-10-07T08:57:00.000Z	efrancolaporte		no i dont think the PSU has its fan conencted directly to the MB though
2006-10-07T08:58:00.000Z	efrancolaporte		yes the motherboard has its 4 pin connected to the PSU as well
2006-10-07T08:59:00.000Z	efrancolaporte		no i am not getting nopower whatsoever even the case fan do not start
2006-10-07T08:59:00.000Z	efrancolaporte		no the MB isn't dead because I'm using it right now with the older PSU
2006-10-07T08:59:00.000Z	bsdfox	efrancolaporte	LOTS of PSUs are DOA
2006-10-07T08:57:00.000Z	bsdfox	efrancolaporte	I work at a computer repair place.. there isn't anything like that on an emachines
2006-10-07T08:58:00.000Z	bsdfox	efrancolaporte	you're not getting anything or just no video? have you made sure you've got the 4-pin connector plugged in too if the mobo has a slot for it?
2006-10-07T08:58:00.000Z	bsdfox	efrancolaporte	other than that.. maybe it was really the mobo that went out
2006-10-07T09:01:00.000Z	bsdfox	efrancolaporte	it's a bad power supply
2006-10-07T09:02:00.000Z	bsdfox	efrancolaporte	exchange will be free
2006-10-07T09:02:00.000Z	bsdfox	efrancolaporte	exchange it for a good one
2006-10-07T09:07:00.000Z	bsdfox	efrancolaporte	it's a dead PSU if it makes sound for a second then nothing until you unplug it for a bit
2006-10-07T09:07:00.000Z	bsdfox	efrancolaporte	I bet the caps are bad
