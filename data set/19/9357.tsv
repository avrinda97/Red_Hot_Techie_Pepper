2008-07-18T00:13:00.000Z	loquitus_of_borg		Hey people. I have a question. Why is it that if I ssh (with X11 forwarding) to a remote host and run firefox THERE, it runs locally?
2008-07-18T00:13:00.000Z	Slart	loquitus_of_borg	you have to do ssh -X yourhost yourcommandline if you want it to be run on your computer
2008-07-18T00:14:00.000Z	Slart	loquitus_of_borg	of course this depends on what you mean by locally ...
2008-07-18T00:14:00.000Z	loquitus_of_borg	Slart	I have firefox locally and also remotely. Now I KNOW that the local version is 3.0. The remote version is 2.0. When I run it WHILE logged on remotely, the local 3.0 version runs!
2008-07-18T00:15:00.000Z	Slart	loquitus_of_borg	hmm.. let my try that..
2008-07-18T00:17:00.000Z	Slart	loquitus_of_borg	when I run firefox using ssh I get the remote version of firefox
2008-07-18T00:17:00.000Z	Slart	loquitus_of_borg	it doesn't start my local version of firefox
2008-07-18T00:19:00.000Z	loquitus_of_borg	Slart	this is weird.
2008-07-18T00:19:00.000Z	Slart	loquitus_of_borg	yes... perhaps it's some kind of setting somewhere..
2008-07-18T00:20:00.000Z	loquitus_of_borg	Slart	keep in mind that if I run xclock, it runs the remote version
2008-07-18T00:21:00.000Z	Slart	loquitus_of_borg	but.. where is this defined.. I certainly haven't configured this.. have you?
2008-07-18T00:22:00.000Z	loquitus_of_borg	Slart	nope... that's why I am asking here.
2008-07-18T00:23:00.000Z	Slart	loquitus_of_borg	very strange
2008-07-18T00:26:00.000Z	Slart	loquitus_of_borg	perhaps firefox does some kind of weird thing on startup.. I can't run one 32 bit firefox and one 64 bit firefox at the same time for example.. perhaps firefox is just the weird exeption here
2008-07-18T00:37:00.000Z	Slart	loquitus_of_borg	ahh.. so it was firefox being weird.. good catch
2008-07-18T00:38:00.000Z	Slart	loquitus_of_borg	I wonder who thought of this and figured.. yea.. let's do it like this..
2008-07-18T00:38:00.000Z	Slart	loquitus_of_borg	but wait.. I'm the same user on both machines.. I should get that too..
2008-07-18T00:39:00.000Z	Slart	loquitus_of_borg	ahh.. that might have been it
2008-07-18T00:40:00.000Z	Slart	loquitus_of_borg	stupid people will do stupid things anyway.. this won't stop them =)
