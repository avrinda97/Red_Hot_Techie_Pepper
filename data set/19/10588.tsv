2007-09-07T07:23:00.000Z	Pelo	Jose	 define repair ?
2007-09-07T07:25:00.000Z	Jose	Pelo	i can't install ubuntu in my pc
2007-09-07T07:26:00.000Z	Pelo	Jose	the cd won't boot ? it boots but you can't perform the install ?  the install starts but something happens ?
2007-09-07T07:27:00.000Z	Pelo	Jose	try using the alternate install cd , it requires less resources to install might be easier on your comp
2007-09-07T07:27:00.000Z	Jose	Pelo	I can load the alternate an the desktop cd but When  it is isntalling it stops in 15%
2007-09-07T07:28:00.000Z	Jose	Pelo	I tried with mandriva 2007
2007-09-07T07:29:00.000Z	Pelo	Jose	 pre partition your hdd ,  make 3 partition   one / 5-10 gig ext3, /swap 2xram , the rest for /home ext3 ,   then use manual partitonning when you get to that step,   and only let the installer format the / partition , that might help , it will cut down on some of the work
2007-09-07T07:32:00.000Z	Jose	Pelo	I made  the chkdsk/f command and I installed Mnadriva but now ubuntu 7.04 ca'nt make changes in the HD,
2007-09-07T07:32:00.000Z	Jose	Pelo	I'll try with the latest version of GPARTED
2007-09-07T07:32:00.000Z	Pelo	Jose	I'm not sure what changes you are talking about , sorry , I think your problem is a bit over my head
2007-09-07T07:35:00.000Z	Pelo	Jose	 ubuntu mounts the partition at start up on the live cd, you need to unmount them first
2007-09-07T07:36:00.000Z	Jose	Pelo	Must I unmount the partitions before to begin the installation
2007-09-07T07:37:00.000Z	Pelo	Jose	you shouldnT' have to but if you partition manualy you might have to
2007-09-07T07:37:00.000Z	Pelo	Jose	 meaning I realy donT' know
2007-09-07T07:39:00.000Z	Pelo	Jose	 best of luck
