2007-03-04T14:55:00.000Z	ahave	gyaresu	what do you mean by dmesg?
2007-03-04T14:55:00.000Z	gyaresu	ahave	cool. now unplug and replug then open a terminal and run the command 'dmesg' post the last page of it to pastebin.
2007-03-04T14:58:00.000Z	gyaresu	ahave	No. it won't do anything bad.
2007-03-04T14:59:00.000Z	gyaresu	ahave	do what thoreauputic said. Run 'cd'. That will put you in you home directory.
