2007-10-26T18:35:00.000Z	Pici	s00p	okay :)
2007-10-26T18:36:00.000Z	s00p	Pici	I found similar documentation for fixing the sound. The headphone jack on my docking station does not work yet though :(
2007-10-26T18:40:00.000Z	s00p	Pici	The Ubuntu team knows the sound is busted.. have for some time. Looks like a simple fix, enable intel-hd-audio in the kernel.
