2005-02-13T17:35:00.000Z	cubex		does anybody own an amd64 ere?
2005-02-13T17:35:00.000Z	cubex		here?
2005-02-13T17:35:00.000Z	cubex		i'm trying to get X to run, but it just gives me a black screen
2005-02-13T17:35:00.000Z	mojo__	cubex	yes AMD64 s939 3000+ Winchester
2005-02-13T17:36:00.000Z	mojo__	cubex	but I am presently only running in 32bit mode
2005-02-13T17:36:00.000Z	cubex	mojo__	why's that?
2005-02-13T17:36:00.000Z	cubex	mojo__	any particular reason?
2005-02-13T17:37:00.000Z	mojo__	cubex	because ati video drivers were only avail in 32bit mainly.  But they just released 64bit on the 15th or 17th or sumthin.  I just have not gotten 'round to setting up the 64bit yet.  Am waiting on a replacement hard drive and will do all that at once (had a 250Gb go doorstop on me :( )
2005-02-13T17:37:00.000Z	cubex		actually, for some wierd reason is just worked. go figure
2005-02-13T17:38:00.000Z	cubex	mojo__	a 250GB does that?
2005-02-13T17:38:00.000Z	cubex	mojo__	what was the brand?
2005-02-13T17:40:00.000Z	mojo__		Well bad psu connectors fried the drive.
2005-02-13T17:40:00.000Z	cubex	mojo__	oh, that
2005-02-13T17:40:00.000Z	mojo__	cubex	Thus a 250Gb doorstop <sigh>
2005-02-13T17:40:00.000Z	cubex	mojo__	that's bad, real bad
2005-02-13T17:43:00.000Z	mojo__	cubex	actually, the story is more complicated.  My brother n I had same identical drives.  His "flaked out" while I was getting a new MOBO.  One I was using didn't have SATA so my drive just sat.  I loaned him my drive to copy his data that was corrupt so he could reformat and reinstall.  We didn't know the PSU killed his drive.  After I got my mobo I spent a month thinking I had bad SATA drivers on nforce3, but turns out he gave me back his old "fried" drive
2005-02-13T17:43:00.000Z	mojo__		 by mistake.  It was honest mistake, though.  He'll have money to get him a replacement soon (I hope) and I've been nice enough to let him use my 250 until then, since he already has a ton of stuff installed on it and would be completely down without it.
2005-02-13T17:45:00.000Z	mojo__	cubex	make is Western Digigal, btw.  Descent drives, though WD's idea of MB and GB are not mine.  I do powers of 2, like 1024, etc.. they do decimal 1000's.  Sneakey marketroid bastards ;-)
2005-02-13T17:49:00.000Z	mojo__	cubex	FYI I have a 64bit install that I just don't use at the moment, so Ubuntu64 *does* work
