2008-02-27T13:38:00.000Z	bazhang	Gpalco	this is better discussed in #ubuntu-offtopic
2008-03-14T21:23:00.000Z	bazhang	Gpalco	why not just go for the 9MB minimal iso? then you have almost nothing but x ;]
2008-03-14T21:25:00.000Z	bazhang	Gpalco	there is also the alternate cd that is text based (ncurses)
2008-03-14T21:26:00.000Z	Gpalco	bazhang	that wasn't 100% serious, was it ??? =)
2008-03-14T21:26:00.000Z	Gpalco	bazhang	my graphics card is not supported out of the box
2008-03-14T21:26:00.000Z	Gpalco	bazhang	and I need to install a driver before starting x
2008-03-14T21:27:00.000Z	bazhang	Gpalco	depends on how light you want your system; some like the install only what you need effect--the alternate cd is nice for the graphically challenged live cd cards
2008-03-14T21:27:00.000Z	Gpalco	bazhang	I like the Live
2008-03-14T21:27:00.000Z	Gpalco	bazhang	I only cannot boot off it and the driver is not there
2008-03-14T21:28:00.000Z	bazhang	Gpalco	well try adding acpi=off to the boot parameters
2008-03-14T21:28:00.000Z	Gpalco	bazhang	what is it going to do?
2008-03-14T21:28:00.000Z	Gpalco	bazhang	any other effects of that parameter?
2008-03-14T21:30:00.000Z	Gpalco	bazhang	I greatly enjoyed your replys =)
2008-03-14T21:30:00.000Z	bazhang	Gpalco	well you can reset it once you have the good drivers; nothing to worry about short term
2008-03-14T21:31:00.000Z	Gpalco	bazhang	know I can do apt-get install, than run: startx . How do I turn acpi on ??? Will I need to?
2008-03-14T21:32:00.000Z	bazhang	Gpalco	you can do so once the drivers are installed by removing the boot parameter
2008-03-24T12:50:00.000Z	bazhang	Gpalco	no
2008-05-10T19:43:00.000Z	bazhang	Gpalco	that is the default iirc
