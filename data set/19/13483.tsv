2005-03-26T09:21:00.000Z	mackid		hey, can anyone tell me how to get DVDs to play in hoary?  i'm having a problem...
2005-03-26T09:22:00.000Z	kotatsu	mackid	what's your problem? do you have dvdcss installed?
2005-03-26T09:22:00.000Z	mackid	kotatsu	yes, i do, and when i try to play a DVD in gxine, it shows the FBI warning, then the menu, but it's all distorted and the output to the console where i opened gxine says "stream not demultiplexed ?"
2005-03-26T09:23:00.000Z	mackid	kotatsu	in xine-ui, it just shows the FBI warning then stops.  in mplayer, it won't show a thing
2005-03-26T09:23:00.000Z	kotatsu	mackid	oh, not sure then =( that's beyond anything I know hehe
2005-03-26T09:23:00.000Z	mackid	kotatsu	thanks anyway
2005-03-26T09:32:00.000Z	kotatsu	mackid	is dma enabled on you dvd drive?
2005-03-26T09:32:00.000Z	mackid	kotatsu	no it isn't.  how would i enable it?
2005-03-26T09:35:00.000Z	mackid	kotatsu	i think it made it match up a little more, but it's still not in sync..
2005-03-26T09:37:00.000Z	kotatsu	mackid	is this a relatively recent laptop, and are you running the stock ubuntu kernel?
2005-03-26T09:38:00.000Z	mackid	kotatsu	it's not a laptop, and i'm running hoary preview.. 2.6.10-4-386.  regardless, i just got it to work!
2005-03-26T09:39:00.000Z	mackid	kotatsu	totem doesn't show the menu, it just starts playing the first title, and the sound and video aren't in sync
2005-03-26T09:39:00.000Z	mackid	kotatsu	i don't think i do.  regardless, it works in gxine =D
2005-03-26T09:40:00.000Z	kotatsu	mackid	well, you have to have one or the other installed... I'm guessing that you have totem-gstreamer (default backend) installed, which is still rather sucky
2005-03-26T09:41:00.000Z	mackid	kotatsu	i just installed totem-xine, and now DVDs play in totem as well, with the menu
2005-03-26T09:41:00.000Z	kotatsu	mackid	heh, sure enough... should've known from the get go =P I always forget that totem-gstreamer is the default backend
2005-03-26T09:50:00.000Z	kotatsu	mackid	it doesn't work like that anymore. now you have to create your own .desktop files. have fun!
2005-03-26T09:51:00.000Z	mackid	kotatsu	sounds great, i look forward to making .desktop files
