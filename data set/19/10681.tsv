2006-06-01T05:17:00.000Z	mnk	rukuartic	- any linksys?
2006-06-01T05:17:00.000Z	mnk		!wireless
2006-06-01T05:17:00.000Z	rukuartic	mnk	Hold up, lemme get the model number
2006-06-01T05:17:00.000Z	rukuartic	mnk	wmp54g works great. As for the router, I like the wrt56g handles very nicely
2006-06-01T05:18:00.000Z	mnk		exclelent - thanks for that.
2006-06-01T05:18:00.000Z	rukuartic	mnk	As for notebooks, what I did was take a LiveCD into the store and test them out to see if their internal wireless card worked
2006-06-01T05:18:00.000Z	mnk		hmm ok
2006-06-01T05:18:00.000Z	rukuartic	mnk	And with the wireless card in the computer, make sure you learn how to use ndiswrapper. (I was using he PCI card, not the USB one)
