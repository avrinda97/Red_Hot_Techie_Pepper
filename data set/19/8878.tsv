2007-10-02T14:31:00.000Z	Nalleman		hi. im going to make a backup of my home directory and then reinstall ubuntu. Will i have to change permissions for all files and folder in order do be able to copy them back to my home directory or delete them from my temporary driver?
2007-10-02T05:48:00.000Z	Nalleman		I have tried to download google earth. i get a bin file that i dont know what to to with. any tips?
2007-10-02T05:48:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Nalleman	run it.. but if you add the medibuntu repo, googleearth is in it.
2007-10-02T05:50:00.000Z	Nalleman	IndyGunFreak	ehm.. is there a repo for gutsy or could i use the feisty repo?
2007-10-02T05:50:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Nalleman	*I* just used the Feisty one, and it seems fine, i've used it to insall codecs, google earth, etc...
2007-10-02T05:51:00.000Z	Nalleman	IndyGunFreak	ok, and you uses gutsy as well?
2007-10-02T05:51:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Nalleman	yup..
2007-10-02T05:51:00.000Z	Nalleman	IndyGunFreak	great.
2007-12-01T17:33:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Nalleman	what tye of video card?
2007-12-01T17:34:00.000Z	Nalleman	IndyGunFreak	intel 945"something"
2007-12-01T17:34:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Nalleman	good luck.
2007-12-01T17:34:00.000Z	Nalleman	IndyGunFreak	ok?
2007-12-01T17:34:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Nalleman	i don't believe there's intel drivers for dual screen.. is this a dualhead card,
2007-12-01T17:35:00.000Z	Nalleman	IndyGunFreak	i guess its one card. its in my laptop. it works great in Windows
2007-12-01T17:35:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Nalleman	because there's windows drivers
2007-12-01T17:36:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Nalleman	if there wasn't a windows driver, it wouldn't work in Windows either
2007-12-01T17:36:00.000Z	Nalleman	IndyGunFreak	ok, but to be honest. You dont have a clue if it works in ubuntu.
2007-12-01T17:36:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Nalleman	well, i've got dual screens setup on my PC, and I've had intel graphics before,
2007-12-01T17:36:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Nalleman	and i know there's no drivers for it.
