2008-12-19T06:52:00.000Z	onetinsoldier		hey, i have metacity installed by am wondering why it doesn't seem to show as an option for a session in gdm. anyone know?
2008-12-19T06:53:00.000Z	Izinucs	onetinsoldier	sessions is for kde, gnome, etc
2010-06-01T08:39:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Izinucs	you're running 8.04?
2010-06-01T08:39:00.000Z	Izinucs	onetinsoldier	yep
2010-06-01T08:39:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Izinucs	have you tried  sudo do-release-upgrade  ?
2010-06-01T08:40:00.000Z	Izinucs	onetinsoldier	nope.. before doing that I'll probably just reinstall via cd
2010-06-01T08:40:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Izinucs	hmm? you don't even want to try  do-release-upgrade  ?  perhaps i missed something
2010-06-01T08:41:00.000Z	Izinucs	onetinsoldier	could.. but doing an upgrade online is a lot slower than simply reinstalling.. espicially if I have a separate /home partition.
2010-06-01T08:41:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Izinucs	ahhh, roger
2010-06-01T08:42:00.000Z	Izinucs	onetinsoldier	is there and ubottu factoid for current compatable ATI cards?  I've got an old one in this machine and would hate to be put in the position of having to yank it.
2010-06-01T08:43:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Izinucs	just the link to the HCL
2010-06-01T08:43:00.000Z	Izinucs	onetinsoldier	what's HCL?
2010-06-01T08:44:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Izinucs	Hardware Compatibility List
2010-06-01T08:44:00.000Z	Izinucs	onetinsoldier	where's that?
2010-06-01T08:44:00.000Z	Izinucs	onetinsoldier	thanks.. :)
2010-06-01T08:45:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Izinucs	sure, you welcome. what model of ati is it?
2010-06-01T08:46:00.000Z	Izinucs	onetinsoldier	Radeon 9600 and the list only references Hoary Hedghog and breezy badger.. a little out of date
2010-06-01T08:46:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Izinucs	roger. don't know if that will be supported by one of the open source driver in Lucid or not
2010-06-01T08:47:00.000Z	Izinucs	onetinsoldier	oh well.. at least I've got a backup Nvidia agp card lying around here..
