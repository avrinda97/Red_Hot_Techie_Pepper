2007-03-17T12:56:00.000Z	Ltar		this is a problem-- my period and comma keys don't respond anymore--  I can't use greater than or less than either-- I messed around a bit with the keyboard shortcuts in Ubuntu earlier-- attempting to assign period or comma to something gives a weird result-- imputting ctrl-period for the command displays ctrl-0xc3 and ctl-XF86AudioPlay-- --alternately
2007-03-17T12:56:00.000Z	eck	Ltar	is this in gnome?
2007-03-17T12:56:00.000Z	eck	Ltar	or at the command line?
2007-03-17T12:57:00.000Z	Ltar	eck	this is happening in gnome
2007-03-17T12:57:00.000Z	Ltar	eck	attempting to remap keyboard shortcuts via system-preferences-keyboard shortcuts
2007-03-17T12:57:00.000Z	eck	Ltar	i would just wipe out ~/.gconf and maybe ~/.gnome2 and hope it fixes your mistake. you will lose any configuration you did
2007-03-17T12:59:00.000Z	Ltar	eck	/gconf and /gnome are the shortcut maps? I presume?
2007-03-17T12:59:00.000Z	eck	Ltar	~/.gconf and ~/.gnome2 are where all your gnome settings are stored
2007-03-17T13:08:00.000Z	Ltar	eck	where can I find the gconf and gnome2 files?
2007-03-17T13:09:00.000Z	eck	Ltar	~/.gconf and ~/.gnome2
2007-03-17T13:09:00.000Z	eck	Ltar	also, if you switch to a VT your keyboard should be fine
2007-03-17T13:11:00.000Z	Ltar	eck	typing ~/ brings me to my home folder-- I don't see gconf or gnome2----  argh
2007-03-17T13:12:00.000Z	eck	Ltar	they are hidden, hidden files start with a .
2007-03-17T13:12:00.000Z	eck	Ltar	try this: ls -l ~/.gconf ~/.gnome2
2007-03-17T13:14:00.000Z	Ltar	eck	ahh I see-- It hadn't even occurred to me that ubuntu would hide system files
2007-03-17T13:15:00.000Z	eck	Ltar	it is not system files, it is any file that starts with a .  this is a very old unix thing :-)
2007-03-17T13:15:00.000Z	eck	Ltar	if you use the -a option in ls you can see them
2007-03-17T13:15:00.000Z	eck	Ltar	e.g. try this: ls -la ~
2007-03-17T13:16:00.000Z	eck	Ltar	you can toggle seeing hidden files in nautilus with ctrl-h, iirc
