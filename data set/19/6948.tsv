2007-11-04T23:47:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Sinlore_	I think you can just use the .deb from http://gimpshop.com/download.shtml
2007-11-04T23:49:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Sinlore_	is gimpshopdotnet.blogspot.com the main site?
2007-11-04T23:50:00.000Z	Sinlore_	Megaqwerty	Nah, its gimpshop.com I'm pretty sure.
2007-11-04T23:50:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Sinlore_	then that should do it for ya. Feel free to pm me if you want me to try making a deb myself. (assuming that the debs from their site don't work)

2007-11-05T00:02:00.000Z	Sinlore_	Megaqwerty	I can't figured it out now lol. I installed the package, but I can't figure out where it installed to in order to open it.
2007-11-05T00:02:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Sinlore_	one min, I'm on the phone
2007-11-05T00:02:00.000Z	Sinlore_	Megaqwerty	Okies.
2007-11-05T00:04:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Sinlore_	I don't have it installed myself, but I'm pretty sure that the changes have already been applied to gimp. Applications>Graphics>GIMP Image Editor
2007-11-05T00:05:00.000Z	Sinlore_	Megaqwerty	When I do that it wants me to install GIMP.
2007-11-05T00:08:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	Sinlore_	So, after installation, you tried launching the GIMP. What happened after that?
