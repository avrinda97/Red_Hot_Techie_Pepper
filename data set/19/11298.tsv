2006-02-26T15:02:00.000Z	relachs		has anyone experience with K3B?
2006-02-26T15:02:00.000Z	soundray	relachs	a bit.
2006-02-26T15:04:00.000Z	relachs	soundray	first it said it needs cdrdao, so installed the package with success. Now it says this: http://pastebin.com/565641
2006-02-26T15:05:00.000Z	soundray	relachs	are you on breezy?
2006-02-26T15:05:00.000Z	relachs	soundray	yes
2006-02-26T15:06:00.000Z	soundray	relachs	strange, I used to have to set cdrdao permissions, but never on breezy.
2006-02-26T15:08:00.000Z	relachs	soundray	hmmm... it says its highly recommended... what should i do now?
2006-02-26T15:09:00.000Z	soundray	relachs	I'll look at my setup here, give me three minutes.
2006-02-26T15:13:00.000Z	soundray	relachs	sorry, I can't get k3bsetup to work here.
2006-02-26T15:14:00.000Z	relachs	soundray	:-\
2006-02-26T15:14:00.000Z	soundray	relachs	try chmod u+s /usr/bin/cdrdao (note this is a security risk)
2006-02-26T15:15:00.000Z	soundray	relachs	you'll need sudo for it.
2006-02-26T15:16:00.000Z	relachs	soundray	i will try to burn a cd then without changing anything
2006-02-26T15:17:00.000Z	soundray	relachs	it's only unsafe if there are untrusted users on your system.
2006-02-26T15:21:00.000Z	relachs	soundray	ok, did it, i typed sudo before the chmod command but he did not ask me for a password, but now the message from K3B does not appear anymore
2006-02-26T15:22:00.000Z	soundray	relachs	you had probably used sudo before and the passwd was still in memory. Anyway, I expect it'll work now.
2006-02-26T15:23:00.000Z	relachs	soundray	ok, here is a screen anyway http://img162.imageshack.us/img162/7945/k3bsetup3sp.png
2006-02-26T15:24:00.000Z	soundray	relachs	yeah, I know, I got this on Debian all the time.
2006-02-26T15:33:00.000Z	soundray	relachs	wei doch jeder ;)
