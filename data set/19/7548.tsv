2007-08-31T10:13:00.000Z	stefano	serenityUK	damn :D avantgoard i see.
2007-09-05T07:14:00.000Z	serenityUK	stefano	you install compizconfig-settings-manager then its in the menu System->Prefs
2007-09-05T07:14:00.000Z	stefano	serenityUK	ill try your way... see what happens.
2007-09-05T07:29:00.000Z	stefano	serenityUK	How do i make the settings i modified be applied??? I change something and it doesn't work.
2007-09-05T07:30:00.000Z	serenityUK	stefano	are you sure you installed full compiz fusion or just old compiz?
2007-09-05T07:31:00.000Z	stefano	serenityUK	i have Gutsy, it came with it. All the other repositories related to compiz are installed.
2007-09-05T07:32:00.000Z	serenityUK	stefano	ok have you set up the 3D drivers?
2007-09-05T07:33:00.000Z	stefano	serenityUK	yes.. The problem is that if i enable a plugin or change some keys, i don't know when or how to apply them.
2007-09-05T07:34:00.000Z	serenityUK	stefano	it happens straight away..... when you enable 3D drivers you should notice the shadows and window effects already without the config
2007-09-05T07:34:00.000Z	serenityUK	stefano	wobble isn't on by default but as soon as GL is set up the shadows appear and windows fade etc
2007-09-05T07:35:00.000Z	stefano	serenityUK	yes i see the shadows and all the default plugins enabled. What i want is to change something, like a key comb for some effect, but don't know how to apply it.
2007-09-05T07:36:00.000Z	serenityUK	stefano	as I say it normally happens as soon as you pick... can you turn the cube on.. there are two rotate cube and cube 3D
2007-09-05T07:37:00.000Z	stefano	serenityUK	lol... well its ok. I am sure that after i restart the settings will be applied. lol and i thought there was no reason at all to restart linux.
2007-12-22T08:09:00.000Z	serenityUK	stefano	lol,  standing on the branch as you saw
