2009-12-16T17:25:00.000Z	Huck		2 days ago my Skype start to crash when i open it, but i dont received none error, only like this: Skype --->open---> appears the window of Skype and crash....someone can help me?
2009-12-16T17:27:00.000Z	jadakren	Huck	run skype from the terminal and copy the resulting errors that appear then paste them on pastebin, then give url here
2009-12-16T17:32:00.000Z	Huck	jadakren	now i have not installed skype
2009-12-16T17:32:00.000Z	jadakren	Huck	one question : did you recently do some system updates from a sytem tray icon ?
2009-12-16T17:34:00.000Z	jadakren	Huck	and have you restarted your machine since then ? ( i mean did you experience the errors with skype after updating system? )
2009-12-16T17:35:00.000Z	jadakren	Huck	ok. you are aware that when a new kernel is installed that any errors experiences between then and the next system restart are most likely a result of the new kernel needing to re-introduce itself to the sytem (which happens at restart)
2009-12-16T17:35:00.000Z	jadakren	Huck	sorry i can only read english unfortunatly
2009-12-16T17:37:00.000Z	jadakren	Huck	did you use that command to install skype ?
2009-12-16T17:38:00.000Z	jadakren	Huck	also (since i do not have suck a package by that name) i assume you are getting this package from a non-standard repository ?
2009-12-16T17:39:00.000Z	jadakren	Huck	once you have skype installed come back for some more help of getting a decent error log
2009-12-16T17:42:00.000Z	jadakren	Huck	you have it installed yet?
2009-12-16T17:43:00.000Z	jadakren	Huck	can;t do much without a decent error report
2009-12-16T17:43:00.000Z	jadakren	Huck	it's ok i translated you previous pastebin with google .
2009-12-16T17:44:00.000Z	jadakren	Huck	but you are still having the problem of a non-existant skype package yes ?
2009-12-16T17:45:00.000Z	jadakren	Huck	is it safe to assume you are using karmic (9.10) ?
2009-12-16T17:46:00.000Z	jadakren	Huck	no i mean the version of ubuntu you are using ? it is 9.10 yes ?
2009-12-16T17:48:00.000Z	jadakren	Huck	can you open the text file : /etc/apt/sources.list and paste the single line here that mentions "medibuntu"
2009-12-16T17:49:00.000Z	jadakren	Huck	gksudo gedti /etc/apt/sources.list
