2009-12-02T04:21:00.000Z	minimec	alaqsory	what does that mean? wifi ethernet? Did you reboot your machine?
2009-12-02T04:23:00.000Z	minimec	alaqsory	can you open a terminal and do ifconfig? there should be something for eth0...
2009-12-02T04:24:00.000Z	alaqsory	minimec	I am now on windows
2009-12-02T04:26:00.000Z	alaqsory	minimec	will log into ubuntu then come again to windows to give you the result of ifconfig
2009-12-02T04:26:00.000Z	minimec	alaqsory	ok. Good idea ;)
2009-12-02T04:37:00.000Z	minimec	alaqsory	Yes?
2009-12-02T04:39:00.000Z	minimec	alaqsory	Ok. The hardware seems to be recognized well.
2009-12-02T04:39:00.000Z	minimec	alaqsory	So still no internet connection?
2009-12-02T04:39:00.000Z	alaqsory	minimec	yes
2009-12-02T04:40:00.000Z	alaqsory	minimec	it is my second time
2009-12-02T04:41:00.000Z	minimec	alaqsory	are you behind a router? Could you try to ping the router's ip like 192.168.1.1 or equal? You can also try to boot an older kernel. Just choose on older kernel when the brub screen pops up.
2009-12-02T04:42:00.000Z	minimec	alaqsory	So you cannot ping the router... Try to boot an older kernel.
2009-12-02T04:42:00.000Z	alaqsory	minimec	i will try soon
2009-12-02T04:42:00.000Z	alaqsory	minimec	thank you very much for helping
2009-12-02T04:43:00.000Z	minimec	alaqsory	no problem...
