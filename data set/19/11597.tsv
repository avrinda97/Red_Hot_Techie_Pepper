2006-01-26T13:02:00.000Z	liable	Froo	and if you dont use ubuntu, why are you asking here?
2006-01-26T13:03:00.000Z	Froo	liable	I was looking for a debian newbie channel and they told me to come here...

2006-01-26T13:03:00.000Z	Froo	liable	Just came from there, pal.
2006-01-26T13:04:00.000Z	liable	Froo	and i see you didnt even ask a question..
2006-01-26T13:06:00.000Z	Froo	liable	Wtf are you talking about?
2006-01-26T13:06:00.000Z	liable	Froo	you didnt even ask a question. #ubuntu doesnt support debian.

2006-01-26T13:06:00.000Z	liable	Froo	they were wrong to tell you to come here.
