2006-11-14T07:22:00.000Z	Dobs		please help
2006-11-14T07:24:00.000Z	dooglus	Dobs	what if you do "mplayer -vo x11 movie.avi"?
2006-11-14T07:25:00.000Z	Dobs	dooglus	on my way to try as we speak
2006-11-14T07:25:00.000Z	Dobs	dooglus	works perfectly! how do i get this in mozilla?
2006-11-14T07:26:00.000Z	dooglus	Dobs	maybe by adding a line saying "vo=x11" to ~/.mplayer/config
2006-11-14T07:31:00.000Z	Dobs	dooglus	can u please point me to how to edit ./mplayer/config ?
2006-11-14T07:32:00.000Z	dooglus	Dobs	gedit ~/.mplayer/config
2006-11-14T07:32:00.000Z	dooglus	Dobs	there's a ~ and the . is after the /
2006-11-14T07:33:00.000Z	Dobs	dooglus	ok, "write your own config here" .. how do i insert the mplayer -vo x11 movie.avi ?
2006-11-14T07:34:00.000Z	dooglus	Dobs	just add a line saying "vo=x11" without the quotes
2006-11-14T07:37:00.000Z	dooglus	Dobs	I use the arrow keys
2006-11-14T07:37:00.000Z	dooglus	Dobs	is it a short movie?  mplayer exits at the end of the movie.
2006-11-14T07:37:00.000Z	dooglus	Dobs	does the left arrow at leave take you back to the start?
2006-11-14T07:38:00.000Z	Dobs	dooglus	exits the app immediately .. (no, it's a 2 hour divx) .. any key exited the app straight away
2006-11-14T07:38:00.000Z	Dobs	dooglus	how bout if i used the gui mplayer with the same commands? will work?
2006-11-14T07:38:00.000Z	dooglus	Dobs	I use 'mplayer-nogui' - haven't really tried the gui versions much at all
2006-11-14T07:39:00.000Z	dooglus	Dobs	do you see any message in the terminal about why it's exiting?
