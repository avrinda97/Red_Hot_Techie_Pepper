2008-01-26T23:54:00.000Z	Otacon22		i need some info about clusters, anyone can answer me in pvt?
2008-01-26T23:55:00.000Z	danand	Otacon22	- what sort of cluster - what are you looking to do with it
2008-01-26T23:57:00.000Z	Otacon22	danand	?
2008-01-26T23:57:00.000Z	danand	Otacon22	- your talking (i believe) about HPC Clusters - High performance computing. Rendering farms - that type of thing?
2008-01-26T23:59:00.000Z	danand	Otacon22	- you mean you want to play games using a cluster of computers??
2008-01-27T00:00:00.000Z	danand	Otacon22	- I've been around clusters and HPC parallel computing for a while and I've never heard of anyone doing anything like that
2008-01-27T00:01:00.000Z	Otacon22	danand	if i will compile for example wine program
2008-01-27T00:01:00.000Z	danand	Otacon22	- good creative thinking ;)
2008-01-27T00:02:00.000Z	danand	Otacon22	- No -  the game would have to be specially written to make use of all the pc's
2008-01-27T00:04:00.000Z	danand	Otacon22	- I don't think what you want to do (Use cluster of linux hosts running wine to run windows games faster)
2008-01-27T00:04:00.000Z	danand	Otacon22	will work without rewrite of game
2008-01-27T00:04:00.000Z	Otacon22	danand	this idea comed because a my friend wanted to change pc and i saied him:"we should make a super pc, what supports all  new games with shaders and all.." and another my friend have 10-15 old pc that i could use
2008-01-27T00:04:00.000Z	danand	Otacon22	Sorry join last 2
2008-01-27T00:05:00.000Z	Otacon22	danand	and i can't also use all pc to create a powerful main pc?
2008-01-27T00:06:00.000Z	danand	Otacon22	- no - not in the manner that you want to do
2008-01-27T00:06:00.000Z	danand	Otacon22	- to make use of all them machines you need specially written applications
2008-01-27T00:07:00.000Z	danand	Otacon22	- Typically beowulf clusters are used for scientific/engineering purposes
2008-01-27T00:10:00.000Z	danand	Otacon22	- No again the application would have to be specially rewritten to make use of the resources - ie all of your old machines
2008-01-27T00:15:00.000Z	danand	Otacon22	- again not possible in the manner you want to use it
