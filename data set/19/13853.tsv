2010-12-19T16:04:00.000Z	Ileden	neverwhere	ok, I don't know what rolling back a kernel module meand. I'm pretty lost with inner workings of kernels, basically I just know they contain the "drivers" for devices and I can choose which one to run (no idea what that actaully causes, though).
2010-12-19T16:05:00.000Z	Ileden	neverwhere	of course, if it won't work in my case anyway, no need to know :)
2010-12-19T16:10:00.000Z	Ileden	neverwhere	s... that package makes my 2.6.35-23 kernel use the wireless drivers from 2.6.32 anyway?
2010-12-19T16:10:00.000Z	Ileden	neverwhere	can I install that while using the previous kernel?
2010-12-19T16:13:00.000Z	Ileden	neverwhere	I can, if needed, connect the laptop with ethernet wire to net to do the install using the latest kernel. is this a better idea?
2010-12-19T16:15:00.000Z	Ileden	neverwhere	not really, though... i could download the package and install it later, using som weird command line opiton, I think. but I'll just use the wire :)

2010-12-19T16:18:00.000Z	Ileden	neverwhere	em, right, there's a tyop
2010-12-19T16:18:00.000Z	Ileden	neverwhere	however, "E: Unable to locate package linux-backports-modules-compat-wireless-2.6.32-2.6.35-23-generic"
2010-12-19T16:20:00.000Z	Ileden	neverwhere	ok. any other ideas?
2010-12-19T16:21:00.000Z	Ileden	neverwhere	10.10. but was using 10.04 before without problems.
2010-12-19T16:23:00.000Z	Ileden	neverwhere	yikes, i should downgrade? I've heard horror stories of people doing that and screwing up the system...
2010-12-19T16:23:00.000Z	Ileden	neverwhere	is it possible to just use the earlier kernel? will that cause me problems?
2010-12-19T16:25:00.000Z	Ileden	neverwhere	ndiswrapper?
2010-12-19T16:29:00.000Z	Ileden	neverwhere	thanks for the help
2010-12-19T16:31:00.000Z	Ileden	neverwhere	I do have the older kernel still in the system, selectabe from the menu, and using it doesn't cause any trouble - at least not in plain sight.
2010-12-19T16:32:00.000Z	Ileden	neverwhere	where can I configure my system to use it by default, and what problems might this cause?
2010-12-19T16:34:00.000Z	Ileden	neverwhere	hmm, it's worth a try to just keep on using the earlier kernel then. how do I configure the system (grub)? and will it revert back to latest when there's a kernel update?
2010-12-19T16:37:00.000Z	Ileden	neverwhere	yeah, I'll do that. and I can try upgrading the kernel to an even later vresion some day, to see if the problem has gone away. :) But how do I configure grub to use the previous kernel as a default?
