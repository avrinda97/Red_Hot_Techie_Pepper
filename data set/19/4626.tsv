2010-01-08T07:48:00.000Z	jschall	Cubey	ok, are you offering to pay?
2010-01-08T07:48:00.000Z	Cubey	jschall	No more than I am willing to buy your games for you.
2010-01-08T07:48:00.000Z	jschall	Cubey	some people have principles, too.
2010-01-08T07:49:00.000Z	Cubey	jschall	Do you buy your games? If so, buy windows.
2010-01-08T07:49:00.000Z	jschall	Cubey	yes, i buy games, and they work fine in ubuntu. thanks for your concern, you can go to #windows now
2010-01-08T07:50:00.000Z	Cubey	jschall	May as well, no one here wants to help with anything but windows games
2010-01-08T07:50:00.000Z	jschall	Cubey	then they should go to #winehq
2010-01-08T07:50:00.000Z	Cubey	jschall	Yeah, they should. I came in asking ubuntu questions and got drowned out by the game junk,.
2010-01-08T07:51:00.000Z	jschall	Cubey	what was your question?
2010-01-08T07:52:00.000Z	jschall	Cubey	the login screen preferences tool has been lobotomized, from what i've seen.
2010-01-08T07:52:00.000Z	Cubey	jschall	Yeah. it looks like the classic Mac OS\
2010-01-08T07:54:00.000Z	jschall	Cubey	well, i'm trying to find something in gconf, but it might not be there... have you tried sound preferences, sound theme, "no sound?"
2010-01-08T07:55:00.000Z	Cubey	jschall	does nothing. like i said, seems to be detached from that..
2010-01-08T07:58:00.000Z	jschall	Cubey	here's one article i found: http://www.ubuntumini.com/2009/09/hack-karmics-gdm-login-screen.html
2010-01-08T08:01:00.000Z	Cubey	jschall	Thanks, reading...
2010-01-08T08:53:00.000Z	Cubey	jschall	I finally solved it, it's the file /usr/share/sounds/ubuntu/stereo/system_ready.ogg ... I renamed it and now it doesn't play that godawful sound
