2009-11-19T10:47:00.000Z	isolat3dsh33p	Billiard	my connection is crappy, it's crappy in XP as well but not as crappy in Ubuntu 9.10. I need to refresh few times to load a webpage. P/s: I've disabled IPv6
2009-11-19T10:48:00.000Z	Billiard	isolat3dsh33p	poor signal?
2009-11-19T10:49:00.000Z	isolat3dsh33p	Billiard	my router is just few centimeters from my laptop.. :/
2009-11-19T10:49:00.000Z	Billiard	isolat3dsh33p	other networks on the same channel?
2009-11-19T10:49:00.000Z	isolat3dsh33p	Billiard	but the wireless connection is 48%
2009-11-19T10:50:00.000Z	isolat3dsh33p	Billiard	what do u mean? LAN?
2009-11-19T10:50:00.000Z	Billiard	isolat3dsh33p	no other wireless networks in the area?
2009-11-19T10:51:00.000Z	isolat3dsh33p	Billiard	nope, there's only one.
2009-11-19T10:53:00.000Z	Billiard	isolat3dsh33p	well could be poor wireless drivers in ubuntu, you said its bad in windows too, maybe its a poor quality router or card
2009-11-19T10:54:00.000Z	isolat3dsh33p	Billiard	it's far better in XP. In XP I dont need to refresh multiple times. How do i check my internet device?
2009-11-19T10:56:00.000Z	Billiard	isolat3dsh33p	check your internet device?
2009-11-19T10:57:00.000Z	isolat3dsh33p	Billiard	how?
2009-11-19T10:57:00.000Z	Billiard	isolat3dsh33p	idk what you want to check?
2009-11-19T10:58:00.000Z	isolat3dsh33p	Billiard	nvm. Thanks anyway. :)
2009-11-24T15:18:00.000Z	Billiard	isolat3dsh33p	uname -a
2009-12-10T05:05:00.000Z	Billiard	isolat3dsh33p	if you didnt make any changes manually you should install the mantainers version
2009-12-10T05:07:00.000Z	isolat3dsh33p	Billiard	I'm not sure I did, but I have dual boot. I don't have to reconfigure it for dual boot right?
