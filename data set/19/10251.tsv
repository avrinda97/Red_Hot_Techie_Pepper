2006-07-07T07:57:00.000Z	T313C0mun1s7	pulpfiction	I just came in so sorry if I am jumping in. DId you check what my be blocking? IPTables, Router, NAT, etc . . .
2006-07-07T07:59:00.000Z	T313C0mun1s7	pulpfiction	I am not sure exactly what you are doing, but if it is trying to get any type of server daemon working on your computer you will need port forwarding rules in the router to get you through NAT.
2006-07-07T08:03:00.000Z	pulpfiction	T313C0mun1s7	yeah, i'm checking this site now ( http://www.portforward.com/ ), will see if that works
2006-07-07T08:04:00.000Z	T313C0mun1s7	pulpfiction	what kind of router(s) are between your connection and your gateway
2006-07-07T08:05:00.000Z	pulpfiction	T313C0mun1s7	dslink 220e
2006-07-07T08:07:00.000Z	T313C0mun1s7	pulpfiction	unless that unit is also your modem, you may need to portforward from the modem as well. With Cable and a Motorola Surfboard modem you don't need to do anything, (cont)
2006-07-07T08:08:00.000Z	pulpfiction	T313C0mun1s7	yeah, it's my adsl modem :)
2006-07-07T08:15:00.000Z	T313C0mun1s7	pulpfiction	nevermind I got it
2006-07-07T08:16:00.000Z	T313C0mun1s7	pulpfiction	how would I do that anyhow? From the term? Is there a good gui SSH program in the repos?
