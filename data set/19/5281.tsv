2008-08-01T10:15:00.000Z	rebel_kid		odd, stupid question... im very new to programming, i know javascript fairly well but im looking to learn basic computer programming, what is the simplest language i can start off with, i need it to do basic computations and basic user graphical interface, with the ability to be compiled into a linux or windows program
2008-08-01T10:15:00.000Z	Flannel	rebel_kid	Check out python.  diveintopython.org and theres a tutorial on python.org too
2008-08-01T10:16:00.000Z	rebel_kid	Flannel	i thought python was a web based language
2008-08-01T10:16:00.000Z	Flannel	rebel_kid	Nope
2008-08-01T10:16:00.000Z	Flannel	rebel_kid	about a third of the stuff in Ubuntu is held together with python
2008-08-01T10:16:00.000Z	rebel_kid	Flannel	awesome, ill take a look and see if it will work
2008-08-01T10:17:00.000Z	Flannel	rebel_kid	Lets move this conversation to #ubuntu-offtopic
2008-09-14T04:18:00.000Z	Flannel	rebel_kid	It's still alpha software.  See #ubuntu+1
2008-09-18T10:43:00.000Z	Flannel	rebel_kid	"top" is already available on your install
2008-09-18T10:47:00.000Z	Flannel	rebel_kid	What information are you trying to get?
2008-09-18T10:48:00.000Z	Flannel	rebel_kid	try ps aux instead of top.
2008-09-18T10:48:00.000Z	Flannel	rebel_kid	You can grep that (ps aux | grep foo) to just return lines with foo in it.
2008-09-18T10:49:00.000Z	Flannel	rebel_kid	what process are you looking for?
2008-09-18T10:55:00.000Z	Flannel	rebel_kid	ps aux | grep gnome-terminal | less
2008-09-18T10:55:00.000Z	Flannel	rebel_kid	That'll give you all of your gnome-terminals, in a pager, so you can scroll through them
2008-09-20T13:09:00.000Z	Flannel	rebel_kid	You'd remove the file's write permissions, but keep write permissions on the folder.
2008-09-20T13:10:00.000Z	Flannel	rebel_kid	Everytime you created a new file.
2008-10-08T12:00:00.000Z	Flannel	rebel_kid	TCP, and #ubuntu-offtopic is probably the place for those sorts of questions in the future.
2008-11-22T10:07:00.000Z	Flannel	rebel_kid	nice?
