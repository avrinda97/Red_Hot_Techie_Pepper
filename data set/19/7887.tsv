2008-08-08T02:11:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter		what does   libglib1.2ldbl actually do, is it safe to remove it?
2008-08-08T02:12:00.000Z	ejer	Pirate_Hunter	if you are not sure, why mess with it... is it causing problems
2008-08-08T02:13:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	ejer	im not messing with it just taking out the garbage that i dont need
2008-08-08T02:13:00.000Z	ejer	Pirate_Hunter	unless you can identify garbage that seems risky ;) and unnecessary
2008-08-08T02:14:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	ejer	just did with debfoster it is helpful very helpful
2008-08-08T02:16:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	ejer	debfoster deletes dependencies used by apps which apt-get & aptitude leave behind as well as telling you which modules a program has installed with it, you should search for it and read the page
2008-08-08T02:16:00.000Z	ejer	Pirate_Hunter	i know very well what it does, and unless you are critically low on disk space it will not make your system faster or help at all really, just risk breakin stuff
2008-08-08T02:17:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	ejer	isnt that comment based upon opinion and im sure this conversation is supposed to be in offtopic
2008-08-08T02:20:00.000Z	ejer	Pirate_Hunter	no, not opinion at all, and you asked the question, meaning you don't understand what the lib is for, hence since this is a support channel I advised you not to mess with stuff you don't understand, feel free to ignore me and do it anyways
2008-08-08T02:20:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	ejer	XD
