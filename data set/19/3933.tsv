2009-06-26T01:22:00.000Z	xiong		suggestions for a better mail client?
2009-06-26T01:24:00.000Z	xiong		my prefs irrelevant
2009-06-26T01:24:00.000Z	ikonia	xiong	your preference is all that matters
2009-06-26T01:24:00.000Z	ikonia	xiong	use what YOU like
2009-06-26T01:25:00.000Z	xiong	ikonia	fine -- please, then, help me with evolution; i've been asking for a week -- it seems to be taboo
2009-06-26T01:25:00.000Z	ikonia	xiong	I can try, what's the problem
2009-06-26T01:25:00.000Z	xiong	ikonia	can't empty trash
2009-06-26T01:25:00.000Z	ikonia	xiong	what happens ?
2009-06-26T01:27:00.000Z	xiong	ikonia	the attempt to empty trash fails; some items remain in the trash after 'empty trash' -- also, possibly related, attempt to move a message from one folder to another not always correct; sometimes creates a duplicate in trash or just doesn't move
2009-06-26T01:28:00.000Z	ikonia	xiong	wow, I'd log a bug against that straight away, I'd also look at the mailbox tools (I can't remember the names of them) to try to evaluate/fix your mailbox evoultion file
2009-06-26T01:30:00.000Z	xiong	ikonia	my browsing suggests that the bug has been fixed in the newest revision of evolution, 2.26.2; i'm running 2.26.1 and this is the latest version available via synaptic -- i don't understand
2010-02-09T02:54:00.000Z	ikonia	xiong	not at all
2010-02-09T02:59:00.000Z	ikonia	xiong	package is corrupted and would benifit from being removed from the file system
2010-02-09T03:00:00.000Z	xiong	ikonia	swfec-mozilla
2010-02-09T03:00:00.000Z	ikonia	xiong	bang on
2010-02-11T18:24:00.000Z	ikonia	xiong	go through them ant pick what you want, it's that simple
2010-02-11T18:28:00.000Z	xiong	ikonia	You're right, of course. But for many packages, I don't know the correspondence between the package name itself and the name as it appears in menus. For instance, gedit appears as 'Text Editor'.
2010-02-11T18:29:00.000Z	xiong	ikonia	cgc, It's exceedingly clumsy to pull down the menu/submenu, pick out the name of an item, decide whether to keep it (perhaps launching it to refresh my memory), then go into Edit Menus to see what command launches it, then figure out which package actually supports that menu item.
2010-02-11T18:31:00.000Z	xiong	ikonia	cgc, I'm thinking of opening Synaptic, filtering only installed packages, and scrolling through the descriptions. But there are dependency issues, too. I suppose that if I miss unused "supporting" packages, I can delete them later.
