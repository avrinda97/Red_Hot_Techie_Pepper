2012-03-04T21:46:00.000Z	nishttal2		hello ppl, i just assemble a computer from scratch.. i used the ASUS P8Z68-V LX mother board
2012-03-04T21:46:00.000Z	nishttal2		it has a graphics card on board with DVI/HDMI/VGA out
2012-03-04T21:46:00.000Z	nishttal2		however the graphics is crappy on Ubuntu 10.10
2012-03-04T21:46:00.000Z	nishttal2		i think its missing a driver
2012-03-04T21:47:00.000Z	nishttal2		does anyone know where I could find the driver
2012-03-04T21:48:00.000Z	minixvbox	nishttal2	sndy bridge wasn't supported at 10.10 i think
2012-03-04T21:49:00.000Z	minixvbox	nishttal2	use a more recent ubuntu
2012-03-04T21:49:00.000Z	minixvbox	nishttal2	don't use unity then
2012-03-04T21:49:00.000Z	minixvbox	nishttal2	xfce is fantastic for me
2012-03-04T21:50:00.000Z	minixvbox	nishttal2	no, you can use whatever is in the repos
2012-03-04T21:51:00.000Z	minixvbox	nishttal2	yes
2012-03-04T21:53:00.000Z	minixvbox	nishttal2	better to fresh install
2012-03-04T21:54:00.000Z	minixvbox	nishttal2	11.10 has 3.0
2012-03-04T21:55:00.000Z	minixvbox	nishttal2	no, xfce
2012-03-04T21:57:00.000Z	minixvbox	nishttal2	its very customisable and gtk based, so not much to worry about
2012-03-04T22:07:00.000Z	minixvbox	nishttal2	have fun
2012-03-04T23:08:00.000Z	nishttal2	minixvbox	how do i ensure that proper drivers for my onboard graphics card are installed
2012-03-04T23:09:00.000Z	minixvbox	nishttal2	what is your onboard card?
2012-03-04T23:09:00.000Z	minixvbox	nishttal2	so intel, that means you don't need to install aanything
