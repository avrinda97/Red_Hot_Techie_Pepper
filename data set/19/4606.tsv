2009-05-07T22:47:00.000Z	eseven73	imachine	have you tried turning off effects? or using a lighter weighted window manager like xfce, fluxbox to see if same thing happens?
2009-05-07T22:49:00.000Z	imachine	eseven73	dude, it's not gnome or compiz.
2009-05-07T22:50:00.000Z	imachine	eseven73	it's nvidai being crap.
2009-05-07T22:50:00.000Z	imachine	eseven73	I need newer drivers, period.
2009-05-07T22:51:00.000Z	eseven73	imachine	im having the same issues every time I upgrade, my nvidia breaks, this time im leaving it broke, I don't really need all the eyecandy anyways since my computers are old
2009-05-07T22:51:00.000Z	imachine	eseven73	I play games.
