2007-06-24T07:32:00.000Z	reed026		I installed Google Earth through the terminal and repository, however I do not know how to uninstall the terminal version
2007-06-24T07:32:00.000Z	EADG	reed026	sudo apt-get install <package name>
2007-06-24T07:33:00.000Z	reed026	EADG	I want to remove programs not install
2007-06-24T07:33:00.000Z	EADG	reed026	no problem... dead easy, sudo apt-get remove <package name>
2007-06-24T07:34:00.000Z	reed026	EADG	would I use the directory name?
2007-06-24T07:35:00.000Z	EADG	reed026	no sir, the package. The name of the program it was installed under. Sorry, don't know a better way to decribe it.
2007-06-24T07:36:00.000Z	reed026	EADG	I can find that by looking under the usr bin yes?
2007-06-24T07:36:00.000Z	EADG	reed026	Yes.
2007-06-24T07:37:00.000Z	EADG	reed026	Whats the name of the program?
2007-06-24T07:38:00.000Z	reed026	EADG	it's Google Earth
2007-06-24T07:38:00.000Z	EADG	reed026	K, sec
2007-06-24T07:39:00.000Z	EADG	reed026	so, in a term type this out; sudo apt-get remove googleearth
2007-06-24T07:40:00.000Z	reed026	EADG	will it remove both copies?
2007-06-24T07:40:00.000Z	EADG	reed026	and googleerth-data   just to be sure.
2007-06-24T07:40:00.000Z	EADG	reed026	err, that I'm not sure about. I would think so If they have been installed to the same place...
