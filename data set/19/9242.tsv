2006-12-29T12:43:00.000Z	maddash		for gtk1, there's the gtk-theme-switch. what about gtk2? I've installed some random theme via aptitude (gtk2-engines-clearlooks), so how do I switch my theme to that one?
2006-12-29T12:45:00.000Z	maddash		anyone here know how to switch the gtk2 themes?
2006-12-29T12:45:00.000Z	hjmills	maddash	its in Systems>Preferences>Themes in gnome
2006-12-29T12:46:00.000Z	maddash	hjmills	if it were that simple, I wouldn't have to ask. I don't have gnome. I fresh installed a server setup of breezy. only have openbox and obconf. and xorg, of course.
2006-12-29T12:47:00.000Z	hjmills	maddash	i think there is a gtk-theme-switch program available
2006-12-29T12:47:00.000Z	maddash	hjmills	firefox, totem, etc...they all look too oldschool for me
2006-12-29T12:47:00.000Z	hjmills	maddash	lol
2006-12-29T12:47:00.000Z	maddash	hjmills	did you read my original comment? gtk-theme-switch is only for gtk1 themes....
2006-12-29T12:47:00.000Z	hjmills	maddash	there is a version for gtk2 themes - i used it on fluxbox
2006-12-29T12:48:00.000Z	maddash	hjmills	there doesn't seem to be a gtk2-theme-switch or a gtk-theme-switch2 in the ubuntu repos
2006-12-29T12:49:00.000Z	maddash	hjmills	do you recall what package you used for the fluxbox?
2006-12-29T12:49:00.000Z	hjmills	maddash	run switch2 from a term
2006-12-29T12:49:00.000Z	hjmills	maddash	its in the gtk-theme-switch package - that has 2 binaries - one for gtk1  and one for gtk2
2006-12-29T12:49:00.000Z	maddash	hjmills	thanks dude.
2006-12-29T12:50:00.000Z	maddash	hjmills	good god. just looking at these butt-ugly controls is enough to cause a stroke.
2006-12-29T12:51:00.000Z	hjmills	maddash	happy to help
2006-12-29T13:11:00.000Z	hjmills	maddash	dont give them root access?
2006-12-29T13:11:00.000Z	maddash	hjmills	yeah, but being able to sudo in the first place...might look unprofessional
2006-12-29T13:12:00.000Z	hjmills	maddash	but they cant - they can try bt it just gets reported to the sys admin and denied
