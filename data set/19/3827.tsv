2009-08-07T16:54:00.000Z	Bennit		hey
2009-08-07T16:55:00.000Z	Bennit		is there a reason why my jaunty (up to date, kernel 28-xx-13
2009-08-07T16:55:00.000Z	Bennit		can't handle 2 mice at the same time?
2009-08-07T16:56:00.000Z	Bennit		gnome goes mad when I plug in the 2nd one, for example: focus is on desktop, (as in selected something) then I press delete and words get deleted in my terminal which i had focus on before I clicked the desktop
2009-08-07T16:56:00.000Z	Bennit		is this a bug or simple known issue that you shouldn't plug in two mice to avoid it
2009-08-07T16:57:00.000Z	Bennit		also, does anyone know the command for "edit menu's"
2009-08-07T16:57:00.000Z	Bennit		as i'd like too see some output when I try to start it (as in: it doesn't start)
2009-08-07T16:58:00.000Z	arand	Bennit	alacarte* something is the command name.
2009-08-07T16:59:00.000Z	Bennit	arand	the problem was alacarte requires sudoers rights
2009-08-07T16:59:00.000Z	Bennit		which you apperently don't get to give as you click it
2009-08-07T17:00:00.000Z	Bennit		thanks arand , where do I report the bug? :)
2009-08-07T17:00:00.000Z	Bennit		on the devel list or on launchpad?
2009-08-07T17:00:00.000Z	arand	Bennit	for me using command "alacarte" gives me menu editor with no passwd prompt, so that might be the problem on your side in itself
2009-08-07T17:01:00.000Z	Bennit	arand	It's multiuser ubuntu with only one real user (non-system-users)
2009-08-07T17:02:00.000Z	Bennit		so I'd see no reason why I can't edit the menu as this user
2009-08-07T17:02:00.000Z	arand	Bennit	so core of problem might be in the permissions of the concerned user...
2009-08-07T17:05:00.000Z	Bennit	arand	i'll still post a bug that some kind of error popup box would be nice "insufficient permissions for this user" or so, then I'll look into the permissions of the user :)
2009-08-07T17:05:00.000Z	Bennit		imo there's nothing so anoying as clicking a button then having to wait not knowing if it's doing something or not
2009-08-07T17:06:00.000Z	arand	Bennit	Yes, that is indeed a valid bug.
