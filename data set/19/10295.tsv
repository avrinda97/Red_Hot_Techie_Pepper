2006-07-10T05:27:00.000Z	azcazandco	avis	definitely shut it down
2006-07-10T05:27:00.000Z	avis	azcazandco	sudo -i in terminal
2006-07-10T05:30:00.000Z	avis	azcazandco	dont mess with apt-get -- go to synaptic and reload sources.  then do a search for "vnc"  find server right select mark for installation then apply
2006-07-10T05:33:00.000Z	azcazandco	avis	looks like it is installed already
2006-07-10T05:35:00.000Z	azcazandco	avis	that doesn't work
2006-07-10T05:37:00.000Z	avis	azcazandco	i only guessed at the packagename you have to look that up in synaptic
2006-07-10T05:42:00.000Z	azcazandco	avis	i have found a getting started guide but the command it says cannot be found
2006-07-10T05:47:00.000Z	azcazandco	avis	think I just ballsed something up
2006-07-10T05:48:00.000Z	avis	azcazandco	ok. something messed up -- what did you do ?
2006-07-10T05:49:00.000Z	avis	azcazandco	reinstall through synaptic.  if you remember the name of what you removed.  it should also install other dependencies
2006-07-10T05:51:00.000Z	avis	azcazandco	are you doing this through apt or synaptic ?  regardless, i think you need someone more experienced than me to fix it.. but i'm sure it can be fixed.  just write down as much info or save to file for reference
2006-07-10T05:51:00.000Z	azcazandco	avis	thanks for your help
2006-07-10T06:08:00.000Z	azcazandco	avis	you still about and willing to help?
