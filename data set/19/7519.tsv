2007-12-28T17:22:00.000Z	scguy318	wols_	what of UNetBoot? is it too impractical for Peeco?
2007-12-28T17:22:00.000Z	wols_	scguy318	since I don't know that thing, I dunno
2007-12-28T17:34:00.000Z	scguy318	wols_	for command not found?
2007-12-28T17:34:00.000Z	scguy318	wols_	if you run it as a user it'll ask you to run as root
2007-12-28T17:37:00.000Z	wols_	scguy318	it's in /usr/sbin which is not in a user's path, only root's. so yes, just typing dpkg-reconfigure gives you command not found
2007-12-28T17:40:00.000Z	scguy318	wols_	/usr/sbin is in my path, I guess that only applies to the default account?
2007-12-28T17:40:00.000Z	wols_	scguy318	it shouldn't be in your user's path
2007-12-28T17:40:00.000Z	scguy318	wols_	but it is, and I don't recall tweaking it so hmm
2007-12-29T18:21:00.000Z	wols_	scguy318	there are hfs+ utils in ubuntu
2007-12-29T18:22:00.000Z	scguy318	wols_	: I'm aware, however, Jan` is more interested in getting to HFS+, and X isn't working so well
2007-12-29T18:23:00.000Z	wols_	scguy318	if you want to support windows: fine. ##windows
2007-12-29T18:23:00.000Z	scguy318	wols_	?
2008-01-02T14:13:00.000Z	wols_	scguy318	xubuntu or fluxbuntu
2008-01-02T14:14:00.000Z	scguy318	wols_	what's up?
2008-01-02T14:14:00.000Z	wols_	scguy318	you start with the same "sc" as ScottNailz  here
2008-01-02T14:14:00.000Z	scguy318	wols_	ah
2008-01-02T14:15:00.000Z	scguy318	wols_	Xubuntu = Xfce, Fluxbuntu = Fluxbox
