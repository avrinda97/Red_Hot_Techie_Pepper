2008-06-28T13:46:00.000Z	solrize		it was someplace pretty obscure
2008-06-28T13:46:00.000Z	solrize		i've been through this before
2008-06-28T13:46:00.000Z	solrize		it's develdocs or something
2008-06-28T13:46:00.000Z	solrize		but i'm having trouble finding it

2008-06-28T13:48:00.000Z	solrize		is there any hope of a base installation that includes all this stuff?  this is just about the most frustrating aspect of ubuntu, all the missing stuff
2008-06-28T13:50:00.000Z	solrize		gparted?  what's that?
2008-06-28T13:50:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	solrize	a GNOME frontend for parted
2008-06-28T13:51:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	solrize	heh, you really are a developer aren't you?
2008-06-28T13:51:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	solrize	that wasn't supposed to be a compliment :P
2008-06-28T13:52:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	solrize	you can get most of the desktop stuff by installing *buntu-restricted-extras after you install the base
2008-06-28T13:53:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	solrize	I did say desktop stuff
2008-06-28T13:54:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	solrize	sounds like you want another distro
2008-06-28T13:57:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	solrize	Ubuntu is a desktop distro. dev stuff has no place in the base install
2008-06-28T14:09:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	solrize	www.debian.org
2008-06-28T14:11:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	solrize	I'm messing around with Fedora 9 right now. Ubuntu has it's rough edges but F9 really is the uncut stone fresh from the rock
