2010-12-22T16:14:00.000Z	Milossh	Us3r_Unfriendly	nope, I'm from serbia
2010-12-22T16:14:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	Milossh	i've had this happen because of a modem firmware update
2010-12-22T16:16:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	Milossh	could this be due to something faulty in iptables
2010-12-22T16:16:00.000Z	Milossh	Us3r_Unfriendly	I didn't touch ip tables
2010-12-22T16:16:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	Milossh	firestart, gufw, ufw or some other front-end to iptables?
2010-12-22T16:17:00.000Z	Milossh	Us3r_Unfriendly	I'm not a linux expert, I use just limited set of tools
2010-12-22T16:19:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	Milossh	sudo iptables -L        gives you an output of the firewall and more output on various sections of chains...I'd start there first...unfortionally i don't know if there's a easy way to this issue
2010-12-22T16:20:00.000Z	Milossh	Us3r_Unfriendly	no rules
2010-12-22T16:21:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	Milossh	no firewall then
2010-12-22T16:21:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	Milossh	what happens if you connect straight modem?
2010-12-22T16:22:00.000Z	Milossh	Us3r_Unfriendly	how?
