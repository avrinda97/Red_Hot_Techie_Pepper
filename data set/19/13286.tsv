2005-06-04T08:33:00.000Z	justin	XhyldazhK	you haven't actually told anyone what the error IS yet
2005-06-04T08:35:00.000Z	XhyldazhK	justin	I can only login as root. I cannot run any process that changes momentarily to another user, I cannot log in as any user distinct of root If I login as a normal user, the login says to me 'permission denied'
2005-06-04T08:35:00.000Z	XhyldazhK	justin	if i try 'su' it says to me 'no shell' and if I try 'su -' says to me permission denied again
2005-06-04T08:37:00.000Z	justin	XhyldazhK	what does it say exactly.
2005-06-04T08:37:00.000Z	XhyldazhK	justin	I have not internet at home, I have to come to office to look for answers. I will try to reproduce the error on a laptop
2005-06-04T08:43:00.000Z	justin	XhyldazhK	no one is going to be able to help you if you are not actually near your computer
2005-06-04T08:43:00.000Z	XhyldazhK	justin	I will reproduce the error in a laptop here
2005-06-04T08:46:00.000Z	XhyldazhK	justin	I reproduced the error
2005-06-04T08:47:00.000Z	XhyldazhK	justin	I did a 'sudo checkinstall' on a package and then ctrl-c the checkinstall when it said 'preparing package documentation'
2005-06-04T08:53:00.000Z	justin	XhyldazhK	ls -ld /
2005-06-04T08:54:00.000Z	XhyldazhK	justin	drwx------ 23 root root 4096 May 28 09:40
2005-06-04T08:54:00.000Z	justin	XhyldazhK	well theres your problem, put it back to 755
2005-06-04T08:55:00.000Z	XhyldazhK	justin	you just saved my life
2005-06-15T10:49:00.000Z	justin	XhyldazhK	updated your kernel how?
2005-06-15T10:51:00.000Z	XhyldazhK	justin	through the panel applet
2005-06-15T11:26:00.000Z	justin	XhyldazhK	boot the cd in rescue mode and reinstall the old kernel?
2005-06-15T11:26:00.000Z	XhyldazhK	justin	that won't erase my package database?
2005-06-15T11:27:00.000Z	justin	XhyldazhK	why would reinstalling the kernel erase your package database?
2005-06-15T11:27:00.000Z	XhyldazhK	justin	I will try that, thanks
