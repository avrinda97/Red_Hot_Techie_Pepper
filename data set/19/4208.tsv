2011-04-06T08:30:00.000Z	cl3tUs		I have a second hard drive installed on our computer and I need to add all the other users to have full rights to it.
2011-04-06T08:30:00.000Z	cl3tUs		It's a shared drive for the whole fam.  How do I do that?
2011-04-06T08:30:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	cl3tUs	is it a linux (ext3/4) formatted driver or windows (FAT/NTFS)?
2011-04-06T08:31:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	cl3tUs	sorry i can't help then, good luck.
2011-04-06T08:31:00.000Z	cl3tUs	ZykoticK9	If it weren't FAT, could I do it through right click > properties > Permissions?
2011-04-06T08:32:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	cl3tUs	you can't apply linux permission to windows drivers - the permission are set in fstab or something.?!?
2011-04-06T08:32:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	cl3tUs	drives not drivers
2011-04-06T08:32:00.000Z	cl3tUs	ZykoticK9	sorry...I didn't mean to have a typo...
2011-04-06T08:32:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	cl3tUs	i was the one with the typo ;)
2011-04-06T08:43:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	cl3tUs	you don't have too, but you can't treat it the same as linux partitions.
2011-04-06T08:45:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	cl3tUs	if you do any torrenting use ext4
2011-04-06T08:46:00.000Z	cl3tUs	ZykoticK9	What is this "torrenting"?  Is that like when waves of water rush in a direction?
2011-04-06T08:46:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	cl3tUs	the p2p application.. torrents.  i turned it into a verb there ;)
2011-04-06T08:47:00.000Z	cl3tUs	ZykoticK9	I was playing :D
2011-04-11T09:51:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	cl3tUs	more than your motherboard can support ;)
2011-04-11T09:58:00.000Z	cl3tUs	ZykoticK9	:D  I like that answer.  I have a coolermaster case, but for some reason, the 3.5 hd's won't fit in their slots.  I need to find one with some space to store my vbox drives on and I'd like 8 GB of ram to run lots o virtuals to teach myself networking and such.
2011-04-11T09:59:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	cl3tUs	8GB isn't even much for 64bit
2011-04-11T10:00:00.000Z	cl3tUs	ZykoticK9	What would you use?
2011-04-11T10:00:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	cl3tUs	meaning 64bit can address a lot more (i personally would love to have 8GB, i only have 4)
