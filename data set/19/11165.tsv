2006-03-24T07:55:00.000Z	AngryElf		runlevel 5 is default for X, right?  then why does it say entering run level 2 right before dropping to the login prompt when booting up?
2006-03-24T07:56:00.000Z	AngryElf		what command displays the current runlevel?
2006-03-24T07:56:00.000Z	silvaran	AngryElf	"runlevel"
2006-03-24T07:56:00.000Z	silvaran	AngryElf	Runlevels are different on different distros... my current runlevel is 2 as well, with full X.
2006-03-24T07:57:00.000Z	AngryElf	silvaran	so i need to drop bootup commands into /etc/rc2.d instead of 5? blah :(
2006-03-24T07:57:00.000Z	silvaran	AngryElf	Do these bootup commands come with ubuntu, or did you write them yourself?
2006-03-24T07:57:00.000Z	AngryElf	silvaran	myself
2006-03-24T07:57:00.000Z	silvaran	AngryElf	apt-get install sysv-rc-conf
2006-03-24T07:58:00.000Z	silvaran	AngryElf	There's /etc/init.d/rc.local for simple commands.
2006-03-24T07:58:00.000Z	AngryElf	silvaran	what's that
2006-03-24T07:58:00.000Z	silvaran	AngryElf	It's a runlevel editor to turn on/off system services.
2006-03-24T07:58:00.000Z	silvaran	AngryElf	But I don't think you need it for what you're trying to do, it's just good to have.
2006-03-24T07:59:00.000Z	AngryElf	silvaran	define simple?  I need these to be run as root......does rc.local get run as root?
2006-03-24T07:59:00.000Z	silvaran	AngryElf	Sorry, /etc/rc.local
2006-03-24T07:59:00.000Z	silvaran	AngryElf	Yup
2006-03-24T08:01:00.000Z	AngryElf	silvaran	the folder /etc/rc.local/ doesn't exist, if i create it will the stuff in it get run?
2006-03-24T08:02:00.000Z	silvaran	AngryElf	/etc/rc.local should be a single file
2006-03-24T08:02:00.000Z	silvaran	AngryElf	You edit it and stick your commands in there.
2006-03-24T08:34:00.000Z	AngryElf	silvaran	i created another file in rc2.d and dropped the commands in it........the file is running, but the commands aren't doing what they normally do....most of them are working but the last one isn't.......once logged in, if I kill the process and do the exact command again, it works....any ideas?
