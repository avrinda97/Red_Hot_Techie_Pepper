2008-01-18T23:28:00.000Z	adrock358		Hi guys.  Is it possible to copy my wireless driver from the live cd and bring it to my installed OS?  The driver used for my wifi card works great in live cd, but, once I install Ubuntu 7.1, it doesn't work at all.  It is not listed in network manager.  So, can I copy a driver from my cd to my OS?

2008-01-18T23:32:00.000Z	MrObvious	adrock358	Can you post your question again?
2008-01-18T23:34:00.000Z	MrObvious	adrock358	Just a sec.
2008-01-18T23:34:00.000Z	MrObvious	adrock358	What kind of wireless adapter do you have?
2008-01-18T23:35:00.000Z	MrObvious	adrock358	Ok lemme search the forums and Google for a minute.

2008-01-18T23:41:00.000Z	MrObvious	adrock358	Really? You can reboot to Windows if you dual boot and download the files you need and get it to work.
2008-01-18T23:44:00.000Z	MrObvious	adrock358	Sorry I closed the link. Can you post it again?
2008-01-18T23:47:00.000Z	MrObvious	adrock358	I wonder if you can just modprobe something. IDK which chipset your wireless uses though.
2008-01-18T23:48:00.000Z	MrObvious	adrock358	Try sudo modprobe rt73 and see if that was it.
2008-01-19T23:37:00.000Z	MrObvious	adrock358	lsusb
2008-01-19T23:37:00.000Z	MrObvious	adrock358	What's the full line?
2008-01-19T23:39:00.000Z	MrObvious	adrock358	I think that's it.
2008-01-19T23:41:00.000Z	MrObvious	adrock358	Reading is one way to learn how to use Linux. :)
2008-01-19T23:43:00.000Z	MrObvious	adrock358	Does it work if you do sudo modprobe rt73?
2008-01-19T23:46:00.000Z	MrObvious	adrock358	Ahh it probably didn't get installed. I wonder if there is a rt73 package?
2008-01-21T22:01:00.000Z	MrObvious	adrock358	Change Directory, or move the terminal to a different folder. EG: cd /home/paul/Desktop would take me from /home/paul to /home/paul/Desktop
