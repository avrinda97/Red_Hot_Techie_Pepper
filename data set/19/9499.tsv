2011-07-29T05:45:00.000Z	slug	Troy^	you need to enable su for the user.
2011-07-29T05:45:00.000Z	Troy^	slug	please tell me how i can do that? im still learning
2011-07-29T05:47:00.000Z	slug	Troy^	do this: sudo passwd root
2011-07-29T05:47:00.000Z	slug	Troy^	but i don't advise you to do this, as there's no need to use root directly. if you are learning, use sudo.
2011-07-29T05:50:00.000Z	Troy^	slug	ty very much
2011-07-29T05:50:00.000Z	slug	Troy^	why do you need su for?
2011-07-29T05:51:00.000Z	slug	Troy^	why is not sudo enough?
2011-07-29T05:53:00.000Z	slug	Troy^	if you want to become root, you can always do sudo -i
2011-07-29T05:55:00.000Z	slug	Troy^	well, if you are a beginner, I advise you to not run bash script as root.
2011-07-29T05:55:00.000Z	slug	Troy^	which documentation are you reading?
2011-07-29T05:55:00.000Z	Troy^	slug	http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/
2011-07-29T06:04:00.000Z	slug	Troy^	for the abs you don't need root
2011-07-29T06:05:00.000Z	Troy^	slug	well the one little script they had that deleted some log files required it
2011-07-29T06:06:00.000Z	slug	Troy^	you probably don't want to delete log files. are you running those scripts on your system or on a virtual machine?
2011-07-29T06:07:00.000Z	Troy^	slug	on my system
2011-07-29T06:07:00.000Z	slug	Troy^	if you want to start playing with root, i would advise you to run UML or kvm so that you don't mess up your system.
2011-07-29T06:08:00.000Z	Troy^	slug	ok thanks :) im thinking of removing my dual boot altogether and just using linux.. im comfortable with it besidesthe fact that i cant play my usual games
