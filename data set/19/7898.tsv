2008-10-20T21:34:00.000Z	mjk		I have an issue with spamassassin and claws-mail that's probably easily fixable. Can anyone help me?
2008-10-20T21:34:00.000Z	cabrioleur	mjk	what's the problem?
2008-10-20T21:36:00.000Z	mjk	cabrioleur	where do I put the spamd daemon so it starts at boot
2008-10-20T21:37:00.000Z	cabrioleur	mjk	sudo dpkg --configure -a
2008-10-20T21:37:00.000Z	cabrioleur	mjk	sorry
2008-10-20T21:37:00.000Z	cabrioleur	mjk	/etc/rc.d/init.d/
2008-10-20T21:39:00.000Z	mjk	cabrioleur	nope that's not the right one
2008-10-20T21:39:00.000Z	mjk	cabrioleur	it doesn't exist
2008-10-20T21:39:00.000Z	cabrioleur	mjk	/etc/init.d
2008-10-20T21:39:00.000Z	cabrioleur	mjk	sorry, wrong terminal window :-)
2008-10-20T21:40:00.000Z	mjk	cabrioleur	that's where I thought also, but it doesn't start. Rather, that doesn't fix the problem. Let me check if it starts
2008-10-20T21:43:00.000Z	cabrioleur	mjk	add symlink to it in /etc/rcS.d and make sure it starts with capital S
2008-10-20T21:43:00.000Z	cabrioleur	mjk	thank you ubuntu for complexity.
2008-10-20T21:43:00.000Z	mjk	cabrioleur	what will this do
2008-10-20T21:47:00.000Z	mjk	cabrioleur	how exactly do I make a syslink. the readme isn't as descriptive as I would like.
2008-10-20T21:47:00.000Z	cabrioleur	mjk	run the script at startup. That's all.
2008-10-20T21:48:00.000Z	mjk	cabrioleur	not what it does. How do I make one
2008-10-20T21:48:00.000Z	cabrioleur	mjk	symlink? it's like a shortcut on your file system. ln -s path/to/original /path/to/symlink
2008-10-20T21:49:00.000Z	mjk	cabrioleur	right I remember learning about that. Thanks
