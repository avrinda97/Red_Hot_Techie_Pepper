2008-07-31T08:29:00.000Z	ice109		umm i'm in xubuntu
2008-07-31T08:30:00.000Z	ice109		forgot to mention
2008-07-31T08:31:00.000Z	ice109		i found a script called xfce4-terminal.wrapper
2008-07-31T08:33:00.000Z	ice109		what is -e?
2008-07-31T08:34:00.000Z	ice109		yea
2008-07-31T08:34:00.000Z	ice109		so i don't get it i can or i can't run multiple processes on on terminal session?
2008-07-31T08:35:00.000Z	td123	ice109	yes, but you can only have one application that is currently using the terminal (other programs can be running in background)
2008-07-31T08:36:00.000Z	ice109	td123	so how do i exit a terminal app without quitting it?
2008-07-31T08:36:00.000Z	td123	ice109	you mean send it to the background? you type "command &" to send it to the background so it doesn't use the current terminal
2008-07-31T08:37:00.000Z	ice109	td123	suppose i launch transmission and want to "minimize" it in the terminal
2008-07-31T08:39:00.000Z	td123	ice109	do ctrl + z to send it to the background, but that will freeze the application sort of "suspending it" to get it back, type fg
2008-07-31T08:39:00.000Z	td123	ice109	but I would just recommend learning screen if you're not going to use multiple xterms/ a window manager
2008-07-31T08:40:00.000Z	ice109	td123	what is screen?
2008-07-31T08:41:00.000Z	td123	ice109	may I ask why you aren't using a window manager?
2008-07-31T08:41:00.000Z	ice109	td123	i am
2008-07-31T08:42:00.000Z	td123	ice109	why don't you just use multiple xterm windows?
2008-07-31T08:43:00.000Z	td123	ice109	oh ok :) that clears up some confusion, keep poking around
2008-07-31T08:45:00.000Z	td123	ice109	home button
2008-07-31T08:47:00.000Z	td123	ice109	try awesomewm, ever hear of tiled wms?
