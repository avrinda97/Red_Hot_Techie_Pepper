2011-07-12T20:40:00.000Z	LmAt		I'm a Linux newbie.  When I add a file system, where can I find its contents?
2011-07-12T20:41:00.000Z	LmAt		Where's "My Computer" for crying out loud?
2011-07-12T20:41:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	LmAt	when you say "Add filesystem", do you mean a device (like a flashdirve)?
2011-07-12T20:42:00.000Z	LmAt	kroq-gar78	Sort of...
2011-07-12T20:43:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	LmAt	k. when you plug a flashdrive in, an icon should come up on the desktop.
2011-07-12T20:43:00.000Z	LmAt	kroq-gar78	ahh
2011-07-12T20:43:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	LmAt	then double click
2011-07-12T20:43:00.000Z	LmAt	kroq-gar78	What if I'm not using a gui?
2011-07-12T20:43:00.000Z	LmAt	kroq-gar78	These sound like "Windows" instructions :)  Tell me what to type.
2011-07-12T20:43:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	LmAt	you have to find the device's "name" (don't know what its called): ls /dev
2011-07-12T20:44:00.000Z	LmAt	kroq-gar78	thanks.
2011-07-12T20:45:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	LmAt	then you have to do "sudo mkdir /media/flashdrive" and then "sudo mount /dev/sdb1", replacing "/dev/sdb1" with whatever the device "name" is
2011-07-12T20:46:00.000Z	LmAt	kroq-gar78	Oh my...
2011-07-12T20:46:00.000Z	LmAt	kroq-gar78	I see why you said, "just double click it" :)
2011-07-12T20:46:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	LmAt	yeah ;) that's why I don't really use terminal-only computers :P
2011-07-12T20:48:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	LmAt	ah got it. I found it out once, but know my VBox is borken. It won't install new kernel modules, so can't help you there. But, try googling "ubuntu guest virtualbox shared folder"
2011-07-12T20:48:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	LmAt	If my VBox works, I can get it for you. But i can't ;(
2011-07-12T20:48:00.000Z	LmAt	kroq-gar78	Thanks.  Why won't it install new kernel modules? What do you mean by new?  New to the vbox or new as of some point in time?
2011-07-12T20:49:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	LmAt	basically,compiled new kernel, so it have to recompile it with some blah, and more blah :/ I have to recompile it (my kernel).
