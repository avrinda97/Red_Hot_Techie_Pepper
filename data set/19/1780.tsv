2010-10-11T22:24:00.000Z	ikonia	drcooper	ok, I have a dirty fix for you
2010-10-11T22:24:00.000Z	ikonia	drcooper	are you there
2010-10-11T22:25:00.000Z	drcooper	ikonia	yes
2010-10-11T22:26:00.000Z	ikonia	drcooper	in your /home/$useraname/.bashrc look for the words "alias" you'll see a few commands being aliased, eg: alias ls=`ls --color"
2010-10-11T22:26:00.000Z	ikonia	drcooper	you need to add a line that says "alias sudo=`sudo -E`
2010-10-11T22:26:00.000Z	ikonia	drcooper	restart your shell, and your problems should be done
2010-10-11T22:26:00.000Z	drcooper	ikonia	got it
