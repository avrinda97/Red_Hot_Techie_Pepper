2011-03-09T04:38:00.000Z	madfox	theprototype	perhaps you should learn to use ubuntu and linux better before going for a specialized distro
2011-03-09T04:39:00.000Z	theprototype	madfox	i agree. but i also think that jumping in to the water is the best way to learn how to swim, thanks.
2011-03-09T04:40:00.000Z	madfox	theprototype	and yet security isn't like water :P
2011-03-09T04:40:00.000Z	theprototype	madfox	yet reading in between the lines would've gave clues that i wasn't talking about water
2011-03-09T04:41:00.000Z	madfox	theprototype	same to you
2011-03-09T04:43:00.000Z	theprototype	madfox	but yea, thats why i want to triple boot Win7, Ubuntu, and BT4, ubuntu is for newbies, BT4 is more advanced, i want to play with both. Can't blame me for that =)
2011-03-09T04:45:00.000Z	madfox	theprototype	I can considering bt was meant for people who already know what they are doing, not for people who are just learning :P
2011-03-09T04:46:00.000Z	theprototype	madfox	yea well computer are meant for people that have half a brain but 99 percent of the world has one, dont they
2011-03-09T04:47:00.000Z	theprototype	madfox	besides, if it comes preloaded with the type of pentesting software it does, it actually is good for a newbie, because they dont have to go through the trouble of compiling, installing, etc
2011-03-09T04:47:00.000Z	madfox	theprototype	no computers were meant to do useful work with varying degrees of sophistication to match the need
2011-03-09T04:48:00.000Z	madfox	theprototype	compiling and installing is better for the newbie then having everything pre-built
2011-03-09T04:48:00.000Z	theprototype	madfox	this is the stupidest debate i've ever had. if you have a problem with people asking questions on a newbie level and you want to make comments about it, make a channel for it
2011-03-09T04:49:00.000Z	theprototype	madfox	i originally asked if i could install ubuntu to an external without having issues, and mentioned i originally tried BT4 on the usb external and it messed my GRUB options up, even after unplugging. Travk informed me this was most likely because the /boot was set to the internal HDD instead of the External
2011-03-09T04:50:00.000Z	madfox	theprototype	no need to get all madders, simply stating your problem would easily be fixed if you focused your energy in a better direction first :P
2011-03-09T04:52:00.000Z	theprototype	madfox	my direction, ATM, is learning aircrack. it comes preinstalled on BT4 and works well with it. Works on ubuntu as well with IW installed, but thats not the point. You assumed i was getting ahead of myself.
2011-03-09T04:53:00.000Z	madfox	theprototype	you are getting ahead of youreself, your point?
2011-03-09T04:54:00.000Z	theprototype	madfox	are u here to help or get the chip off your shoulder? get it off or help, its annoying, considering u don't know anything about my previous knowledge of computers or networking =)
2011-03-09T04:54:00.000Z	madfox	theprototype	you said you were just learning, all I really need to know.
2011-03-09T04:56:00.000Z	madfox	theprototype	I didn't need it, but it's all I need to know about youre previous knowledge and experience.
