2012-05-27T23:59:00.000Z	VDZ		I am going insane here...can somebody please, please tell me how I can simply run two .sh scripts, one as my normal user and one as root, on startup in 12.04?
2012-05-27T23:59:00.000Z	VDZ		There are tons of explanations on the internet, but none of them work
2012-05-28T00:00:00.000Z	VDZ		jrib; the scripts?
2012-05-28T00:00:00.000Z	VDZ		I want at least one to start my VNC server (non-root) and at least one to mount a disk and perform some directory mounting trickery (root)
2012-05-28T00:01:00.000Z	VDZ		But I'll definitely expand them later on to start some screens with server programs and stuff like that
2012-05-28T00:01:00.000Z	VDZ		sesom42; I tried, it doesn't work
2012-05-28T00:02:00.000Z	VDZ		jrib; I've never managed to get any cron jobs (for other stuff) running correctly either. Same problem, tons of explanations and none work
2012-05-28T00:02:00.000Z	VDZ		And can fstab also mount folders?
2012-05-28T00:03:00.000Z	VDZ		sesom; mainly 'tightvncserver -geometry 1200x800' right now
2012-05-28T00:03:00.000Z	VDZ		jrib; you can also mount folders, as a symlink of sorts
2012-05-28T00:03:00.000Z	escott	VDZ	you want to put a bind mount in your fstab?
2012-05-28T00:20:00.000Z	escott	VDZ	what about rc.local?
2012-05-28T00:21:00.000Z	escott	VDZ	the problem with tightvnc is that it resumably needs to wait for X11 to start. it might be better to create an upstart job that depends on lightdm
2012-05-28T00:24:00.000Z	escott	VDZ	look at /etc/init/lightdm.conf or any other file in /etc/init. you can create a job that starts when lightdm.conf emits "login-session-start" and then starts tightvnc
2012-05-28T00:24:00.000Z	escott	VDZ	see http://mlepicki.com/2011/10/remote-vnc-login-to-ubuntu-11-10/
2012-05-28T00:34:00.000Z	escott	VDZ	anything in /etc will be run as root so /home/vdz is inappropriate
2012-05-28T00:36:00.000Z	escott	VDZ	then you have to wait until you login to start tightvnc
2012-05-28T00:37:00.000Z	escott	VDZ	my guess is that its not a problem to have the tightvnc server running as root
2012-05-28T00:40:00.000Z	VDZ	escott	Darael; it finally works! Thank you so much
