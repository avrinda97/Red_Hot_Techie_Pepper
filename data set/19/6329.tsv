2008-05-10T10:24:00.000Z	anolis		i was wondering if anyone can help me with an "Operating System not found" error..  i have a hammerhead XRT tablet computer, 1 usb 1 ethernet, 1x 40gig hitchi travelstar harddrive 2.5" i installed ubuntu 8.04 onto it using a computer that had a cdrom drive.. but it will not boot from the disk once i put it into the hammerhead
2008-05-10T10:25:00.000Z	Le-Chuck_IT1	anolis	make the ubuntu partition bootable ?
2008-05-10T10:25:00.000Z	anolis		it is.
2008-05-10T10:26:00.000Z	Le-Chuck_IT1	anolis	on my acer I have to flag the partition sda1 as bootable and install grub there, not on sda
2008-05-10T10:26:00.000Z	anolis	Le-Chuck_IT1	i can't even get it to read from the hdd..
2008-05-10T10:26:00.000Z	anolis		i was wondering if there may be a guide
2008-05-10T10:26:00.000Z	anolis		or something
2008-05-10T10:27:00.000Z	Le-Chuck_IT1	anolis	it says no operating system
2008-05-10T10:27:00.000Z	Le-Chuck_IT1		how do you know that it doesn't read from HD?
2008-05-10T10:27:00.000Z	anolis	Le-Chuck_IT1	because the same thing happens if i take the hdd out of the tablet
2008-05-10T10:28:00.000Z	Le-Chuck_IT1	anolis	did it work before ubuntu?
2008-05-10T10:28:00.000Z	anolis		no no.. i just got this thing off ebay.. no os pre-installed
2008-05-10T10:28:00.000Z	Le-Chuck_IT1	anolis	make a bootable usb pen with ubuntu _live_ on that
2008-05-10T10:28:00.000Z	Le-Chuck_IT1		and then try to boot from first hard disk
2008-05-10T10:28:00.000Z	Le-Chuck_IT1		or else fiddle with the bios :)
2008-05-10T10:28:00.000Z	anolis	Le-Chuck_IT1	is there a guide on how to do that? i was considering that
2008-05-10T10:29:00.000Z	Le-Chuck_IT1	anolis	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStick
2008-05-10T10:29:00.000Z	Le-Chuck_IT1		pretty handy to have ubuntu always with you :)
