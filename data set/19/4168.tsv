2010-04-24T01:28:00.000Z	erUSUL	acicula	yes; you have to pass --no-preserve-root see "man rm"
2010-04-24T01:29:00.000Z	acicula	erUSUL	wicked, i did not know that
2010-04-24T01:29:00.000Z	erUSUL	acicula	easy to bypass just use /* instead of just /
2010-04-24T01:29:00.000Z	erUSUL	acicula	recent thing.
2010-04-24T01:29:00.000Z	acicula	erUSUL	does it apply to all root points  or just / ?
2010-04-24T01:30:00.000Z	erUSUL	acicula	ther is only one root :)
2010-04-24T01:30:00.000Z	acicula	erUSUL	cat /proc/mount :P
2010-04-24T01:32:00.000Z	acicula	erUSUL	i meant the root of a fs, not the / root, there's a sneaky one hiding under / though
2010-04-24T01:32:00.000Z	erUSUL	acicula	it only preserves /
2010-10-07T20:59:00.000Z	erUSUL	acicula	yes; but it is a brand new driver for the new cards. old cards are still left in the cold. no firmware for b43 driver :(
