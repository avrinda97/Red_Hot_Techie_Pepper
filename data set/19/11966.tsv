2007-03-18T15:58:00.000Z	l90bpm		I have an amd sempron but for some reason only the 64 packages install properly??  any ideas?
2007-03-18T16:00:00.000Z	linxeh	l90bpm	not all semprons are 64bit
2007-03-19T16:01:00.000Z	linxeh	l90bpm	so you need a 32bit version of ubuntu
2007-03-19T16:01:00.000Z	linxeh	l90bpm	eh?
2007-03-19T16:02:00.000Z	linxeh	l90bpm	what version of ubuntu did you install, and where are you getting the packages from ?
2007-03-19T16:03:00.000Z	linxeh	l90bpm	ok, and you installed the 32bit version, and used the 32bit edgy repositories ?
2007-03-19T16:05:00.000Z	linxeh	l90bpm	check the repositories are correct
2007-03-19T16:06:00.000Z	linxeh	l90bpm	you must have changed /etc/apt/sources.list to do the upgrade
2007-03-19T16:11:00.000Z	linxeh	l90bpm	it already has them then i guess
2007-03-19T15:52:00.000Z	linxeh	l90bpm	did you buy windows retail ?
2007-03-19T15:54:00.000Z	linxeh	l90bpm	chances are you can only use it in the machine it came with then, unless it was a retail boxed version
2007-03-19T15:54:00.000Z	linxeh	l90bpm	oh sure, it will work, but the licence forbids you
2007-03-19T16:05:00.000Z	linxeh	l90bpm	yep
2007-03-19T16:15:00.000Z	linxeh	l90bpm	you'll need antivirus on linux or any other platform too once it becomes a viable target
2007-03-21T16:16:00.000Z	linxeh	l90bpm	well yeah, but has a trial
2007-03-21T16:20:00.000Z	linxeh	l90bpm	not legally no. you can re-start the trial on windows too if you want
2007-03-21T16:36:00.000Z	linxeh	l90bpm	yeah, xfce is great for older machines
2007-03-21T16:36:00.000Z	linxeh	l90bpm	its nice, but there are a few quirks still for me - switched to KDE just to make my desktop more usable
2007-03-21T16:37:00.000Z	linxeh	l90bpm	enlightenment ;)
