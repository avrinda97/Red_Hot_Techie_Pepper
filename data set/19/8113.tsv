2007-11-22T05:51:00.000Z	skyhook		hey, is there any reason why when I set ubuntu to auto-login, the screen is zoomed in, but when I log in normally it isnt?
2007-11-22T05:52:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	skyhook	what do you mean by zoomed in??
2007-11-22T05:52:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE		Keith, that sort of thinking wont get anything working
2007-11-22T05:52:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE		Keith, nor will you learn anything
2007-11-22T05:53:00.000Z	skyhook		paddy_EIRE:  Its confusing to explain, but its as if the screen size is slightly bigger than the monitor, and when I go to the edges it scolls over a tiny bit to see the edges
2007-11-22T05:54:00.000Z	skyhook		paddy_EIRE:  Its really hard to explain
2007-11-22T05:54:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	skyhook	do you have an auto-adjust button on your monitor?
2007-11-22T05:54:00.000Z	skyhook	Paddy_EIRE	Yes, and that doesnt fix it
2007-11-22T05:55:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	skyhook	cant think why right now...
2007-11-22T05:55:00.000Z	skyhook	Paddy_EIRE	and whats weirder is that when I log in normally everything is fine
2007-11-22T05:55:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE		!wont work | UbuntMe
2007-11-22T05:55:00.000Z	skyhook		Paddy_EIRE:or if I log out and log back in
2007-11-22T05:56:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	skyhook	have you compared the resolutions?
2007-11-22T05:57:00.000Z	skyhook		Paddy_EIRE:Okay that seems to have fixed it.  Its unclear how that would get changed based on how I log in though
2007-11-22T05:58:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	skyhook	could be the way your session is being saved?
2007-11-22T05:59:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	skyhook	when you have it running the way you like it to start on first login hold alt and press f2 then type gnome-save-session
2007-11-22T05:59:00.000Z	skyhook	Paddy_EIRE	possibly, I didnt change any of those settings my self
2007-11-22T05:59:00.000Z	skyhook	Paddy_EIRE	okay thanks a bunch
2007-11-22T06:00:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	skyhook	no probs
