2012-10-04T18:40:00.000Z	crazydip	sasuke	you need to restart the guest after installing guest additions
2012-10-04T18:40:00.000Z	crazydip	sasuke	if install did not work, just do it by hand
2012-10-04T18:41:00.000Z	crazydip	sasuke	inside your ubuntu guest, mount the cdrom and inside it there will be linux-install-guest-addition.sh or something like that
2012-10-04T18:41:00.000Z	crazydip	sasuke	run that from the terminal
2012-10-04T18:43:00.000Z	crazydip	sasuke	also before installing guest additions you must install dkms
2012-10-04T18:43:00.000Z	sasuke	crazydip	hi i mounted it on /media. inside the iso i found "autorun.sh" &  "runasroot.sh"
2012-10-04T18:44:00.000Z	crazydip	sasuke	hold on let me mount check where it's at
2012-10-04T18:47:00.000Z	crazydip	sasuke	maybe you have some old version of virtualbox because my iso has a lot more files and the one to run is: VBoxLinuxAdditions.run
2012-10-04T18:48:00.000Z	sasuke	crazydip	i have   VBoxLinuxAdditions.run also in that. Can you tell me i can i install
2012-10-04T18:48:00.000Z	sasuke	crazydip	i though only sh files will work on ubuntu.
2012-10-04T18:49:00.000Z	crazydip	sasuke	it's just an extension it does not matter, what matters is what's inside, which is actually an sh script anyway :)
2012-10-04T18:50:00.000Z	crazydip	sasuke	run it like this: sudo sh VBoxLinuxAdditions.run
2012-10-04T18:51:00.000Z	crazydip	sasuke	also note that i'm on the oracle's version of virtualbox not ubuntu's (not the 100% open source)
2012-10-04T18:52:00.000Z	sasuke	crazydip	its installing.. now should i need to install any pcks
2012-10-04T18:54:00.000Z	crazydip	sasuke	pcks? you mean packages? well you needed dkms otherwise you will have to reinstall the additions after every kernel upgrade
2012-10-04T18:55:00.000Z	sasuke	crazydip	i restarted the vbox.
2012-10-04T18:57:00.000Z	sasuke	crazydip	its working .... thnx a lot
2012-10-04T19:00:00.000Z	crazydip	sasuke	awesome, you're welcome... have fun!
