2009-05-14T10:23:00.000Z	simoncpu		how do i prevent my windows from being dragged to the next desktop?
2009-05-14T10:23:00.000Z	mogus	simoncpu	if you don't need extra desktops, you can just set the number of desktops to one
2009-05-14T10:24:00.000Z	simoncpu	mogus	i need the extra desktops, but my windows get dragged to the next one whenever i accidentally drag them off-screen
2009-05-14T10:25:00.000Z	mogus	simoncpu	"accidentally?" are you on KDE?
2009-05-14T10:25:00.000Z	simoncpu	mogus	i am on the default gnome
2009-05-14T10:25:00.000Z	mogus		hm.
2009-05-14T10:25:00.000Z	mogus	simoncpu	are you using a switcher helper like ... forgot the name
2009-05-14T10:26:00.000Z	simoncpu	mogus	i dunno... i've just installed 9.04
2009-05-14T10:26:00.000Z	mogus	simoncpu	hm
2009-05-14T10:26:00.000Z	mogus	simoncpu	dunno. how often does this happen?
2009-05-14T10:27:00.000Z	simoncpu	mogus	every time... it's not a bug, really
2009-05-14T10:27:00.000Z	simoncpu		i just want to turn it off :)
2009-05-14T10:28:00.000Z	mogus	simoncpu	well mine does not do that. but then Ive got an ancient graphics card atmoment and i cant even run level two graphics effects
2009-05-14T10:28:00.000Z	mogus	simoncpu	maybe you can try turning your effects down a level?
2009-05-14T10:28:00.000Z	simoncpu	mogus	but i want the effects too :)
2009-05-14T10:29:00.000Z	simoncpu		omfg. what happened to virtualbox? where did my vms go?
2009-05-14T10:29:00.000Z	simoncpu		brb
2009-05-14T10:29:00.000Z	mogus	simoncpu	i understand. but try and turn them off for a bit to see if that changes the issue.
