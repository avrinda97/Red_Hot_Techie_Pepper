2010-04-30T03:42:00.000Z	Twiple		ok...
2010-04-30T03:43:00.000Z	Twiple		so can anyone here tell me why there is no "side by side with windows" installation option?
2010-04-30T03:43:00.000Z	Twiple		thanks, jordan_u, bye!
2010-04-30T03:44:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	Twiple	Who said there wasnt?
2010-04-30T03:44:00.000Z	Twiple	LinuxGuy2009	I did, it's not showing up at the partition part of the installation
2010-04-30T03:47:00.000Z	Twiple	LinuxGuy2009	is it supposed to?
2010-04-30T03:47:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	Twiple	Sorry you have to remeber there are 1700 people here all talking at once. Gotta speak clearly and refresh my mind.
2010-04-30T03:49:00.000Z	Twiple	LinuxGuy2009	I ran the installer to install ubuntu 10.4 to the computer, there are four partitions, a windows partition, a filestoring NTFS partition, another windows partition(specialized for computer recovery in case things go very wrong), and a fourth one that's small and unknown
2010-04-30T03:50:00.000Z	Twiple	LinuxGuy2009	I got to the partition part and it does not offer an "install side by side with windows" option
2010-04-30T03:51:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	Twiple	Well to be honest unless you know what your doing then your gonna screw up Windows. So expect it. Backup Backup Backup!
2010-04-30T03:52:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	Twiple	Most windows users have 2 existing partitions. windows and swap
2010-04-30T03:52:00.000Z	Twiple	LinuxGuy2009	why won't side by side with windows show up?
2010-04-30T03:53:00.000Z	Twiple	LinuxGuy2009	isn't it supposed to?
2010-04-30T03:53:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	Twiple	With a normal 2 partition setup sure. Otherwise you need to manually resize partitions to make room and do it all yourself.
2010-04-30T03:54:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	Twiple	But Im not the best one to ask. I dont use Windows anymore.
2010-04-30T03:55:00.000Z	Twiple	LinuxGuy2009	It's a swap partition the size of my RAM and a normal boot partition, right?
2010-04-30T04:15:00.000Z	Twiple	LinuxGuy2009	It's a swap partition the size of my RAM and a normal boot partition, right? Isn't that how you do it or will that somehow kill windows?
2010-04-30T04:16:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	Twiple	Well like I said before Im a bad person to ask. I dont use Windows anymore.
2010-04-30T04:29:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	Twiple	Scared of what?
