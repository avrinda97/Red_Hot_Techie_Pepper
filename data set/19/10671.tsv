2006-10-10T15:08:00.000Z	Schalken		is it possible to split a file in to two parts, and then merge them back together afterwards?
2006-10-10T15:10:00.000Z	KurtKraut	Schalken	yes, it is. I cant remember how but sure, you can.
2006-10-10T15:11:00.000Z	Schalken	KurtKraut	Do you know someone/someone that does remember how? ;)
2006-10-10T15:12:00.000Z	KurtKraut	Schalken	usually ubuntuforums.org is the right place for that. The next person who knows how to do it and had I nigh of a sleep (that I havent) may remember and give you further details
2006-10-10T15:12:00.000Z	Schalken	KurtKraut	lol cheers :D
2006-10-10T15:13:00.000Z	KurtKraut	Schalken	there is a friend of mine over Gaim telling that he sent me 3 films to watch and I cant remember that. So I'm kind of 'memoryless' because of the lack of sleep
2006-10-10T15:14:00.000Z	Schalken	KurtKraut	well this time on IRC could be spent sleeping...
2006-10-10T15:15:00.000Z	KurtKraut	Schalken	unfortunately no. I'm just waiting a bit to go to work... (only if at that time I can remember who to go there)
2006-10-10T15:16:00.000Z	Schalken	KurtKraut	lol
2006-10-10T15:17:00.000Z	KurtKraut	Schalken	have you have had memory loss by the lack of sleep or intensive work ?
2006-10-10T15:18:00.000Z	Schalken	KurtKraut	normally at that point i cant be bothered TRYING to remember something
2006-10-10T15:18:00.000Z	KurtKraut	Schalken	I understand
2006-10-10T15:20:00.000Z	KurtKraut	Schalken	I cant remeber thing but I can think (yet at least). I'm installing xarchive packge. May be it does what you want
2006-10-10T15:20:00.000Z	KurtKraut	Schalken	if this works... could tell me atory to sleep (at bed) ?
2006-10-10T15:21:00.000Z	Schalken	KurtKraut	agreed
