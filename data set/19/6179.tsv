2008-03-02T01:29:00.000Z	RiPPeR666		what might this mean??? (WW) NVIDIA(GPU-0): Unable to read EDID for display device CRT-0
2008-03-02T01:30:00.000Z	mjw-	RiPPeR666	you have an old CRT?
2008-03-02T01:30:00.000Z	RiPPeR666	mjw-	i have a lcd
2008-03-02T01:31:00.000Z	RiPPeR666	mjw-	thats whats confusing me too
2008-03-02T01:31:00.000Z	mjw-	RiPPeR666	the EDID info is something you're monitor has in it to tell the video card what it's capable of. I can't imagine any LCD not working with that
2008-03-02T01:32:00.000Z	RiPPeR666	mjw-	yea do you think if the hsyc and the vsync were wrong in the xorg.conf would effect this
2008-03-02T01:32:00.000Z	mjw-	RiPPeR666	perhaps, but i'm not an x.org expert ;)
2008-03-02T01:33:00.000Z	RiPPeR666	mjw-	there anothe line above a lil bit that has troble to so i post that see what you think
2008-03-02T01:34:00.000Z	RiPPeR666	mjw-	(WW) NVIDIA: No matching Device section for instance (BusID PCI:5:0:0) found
2008-03-02T01:34:00.000Z	mjw-	RiPPeR666	so the driver basically doesn't recognize the card as something it can work with, it looks like
2008-03-02T01:36:00.000Z	RiPPeR666	mjw-	i was thinking the same thing. in my xorg.conf it says busid pci is 4:0:0. but this is saying 5:0:0 i think its finding my other card in here and woundering why there r 2
2008-03-02T01:36:00.000Z	mjw-	RiPPeR666	you have two video cards?
2008-03-02T01:37:00.000Z	RiPPeR666	mjw-	yea 2 bfg 7800 sli
2008-03-02T01:37:00.000Z	mjw-	RiPPeR666	ahhh, well then I have no idea at all. I'm completely unfamiliar with that kind of setup
2008-03-02T01:37:00.000Z	RiPPeR666	mjw-	hence why i think xorg.is getiing confused
2008-03-02T01:38:00.000Z	mjw-	RiPPeR666	try removing one and see if it works then?
2008-03-02T01:39:00.000Z	RiPPeR666	mjw-	i did find and option in /etc/default/nvidia-kernal that it asks me how many cards are in the system
2008-03-02T01:39:00.000Z	mjw-	RiPPeR666	that is probably not referring to SLI setups
2008-03-02T01:40:00.000Z	RiPPeR666	mjw-	i was thinking the same thing
