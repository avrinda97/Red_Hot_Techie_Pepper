2008-10-15T23:31:00.000Z	mongolai	AlexMax	try creating another user, log into that and see if things are all well
2008-10-15T23:31:00.000Z	AlexMax	mongolai	I did
2008-10-15T23:32:00.000Z	mongolai	AlexMax	just to confirm: something is wrong in your personal gnome settings?
2008-10-15T23:33:00.000Z	mongolai	AlexMax	OK. Makes perfect sense.
2008-10-15T23:34:00.000Z	mongolai	AlexMax	just a sec. I'm looking up something that might help
2008-10-15T23:35:00.000Z	mongolai	AlexMax	have you tried gnome-reset  ?
2008-10-15T23:36:00.000Z	AlexMax	mongolai	no
2008-10-15T23:37:00.000Z	mongolai	AlexMax	look that up and give it a shot. Try creating a new, new user first and mess up the settings, then try it
2008-10-15T23:37:00.000Z	AlexMax	mongolai	It's worthless.  gnome-reset only works in a GUI
2008-10-15T23:39:00.000Z	mongolai	AlexMax	not quite. you know that you can hit alt+f2 in a borked gnome to get a one shot command-line, right?
2008-10-15T23:41:00.000Z	AlexMax	mongolai	did NOT know that
2008-10-15T23:41:00.000Z	mongolai	AlexMax	cool beans. getting closer
2008-10-15T23:45:00.000Z	mongolai	AlexMax	bummer about the alt+f2. try the other alt key if you have one, and if that dosen't work it suggests that something went wrong with a previous attempt at fixing the original problem
2008-10-15T23:49:00.000Z	mongolai	AlexMax	http://linuxfud.wordpress.com/2007/02/14/how-to-reset-ubuntugnome-settings-to-defaults-without-re-installing/
2008-10-15T23:54:00.000Z	mongolai	AlexMax	sorry. I just realized you might not be able to see the link. It's about how to reset gnome settings. basically you can do a "rm -rf .gnome .gnome2 .gconf .gconfd .metacity" and should be good. I don't know about compiz, nor do I know if this actually works, but it's worth a shot
2008-10-15T23:57:00.000Z	AlexMax	mongolai	Whelp, that didn't work either
2008-10-16T00:00:00.000Z	mongolai	AlexMax	well, I'm fresh out of suggestions to fix. As a last resort, you can create a new user, then transfer your personal files over and chown them, or something like that... Good luck!
2008-10-16T00:00:00.000Z	AlexMax	mongolai	That's what I'm probably going to have to do
2008-10-16T00:01:00.000Z	mongolai	AlexMax	or totally remove gnome-desktop (i think it's called), then reinstall it, but that might put you back to square 1
