2009-07-20T08:34:00.000Z	richardcavell		Can someone let me remotely view their desktop?  I want to see how well VNC works over the Internet. You don't have to give me control of your desktop.
2009-07-20T08:34:00.000Z	bastidrazor	richardcavell	vnc is slow and sluggish regardless of over the internet or on a LAN
2009-07-20T08:35:00.000Z	richardcavell	bastidrazor	isn't it just bandwidth that slows it down?
2009-07-20T08:35:00.000Z	bastidrazor	richardcavell	no.
2009-07-20T08:35:00.000Z	richardcavell	bastidrazor	and in any case, what alternative do you have that is faster?
2009-07-20T08:35:00.000Z	bastidrazor	richardcavell	i don't.
2009-07-20T08:36:00.000Z	richardcavell	bastidrazor	I let q0_0p view my desktop yesterday. Now I want to view someone's desktop to see how it works
2009-07-20T08:36:00.000Z	bastidrazor	richardcavell	freeNX possibly?
2009-07-20T08:36:00.000Z	richardcavell	bastidrazor	Doesn't VNC work by simply getting the X-window server to send the data over the network?
2009-07-20T08:37:00.000Z	richardcavell	bastidrazor	that's the best way to do it, surely
2009-07-20T17:16:00.000Z	bastidrazor	richardcavell	or use a router.
2009-07-20T17:17:00.000Z	richardcavell	bastidrazor	I was using a hardware firewall (router) before.  In fact, two connected in series.  But I forwarded some ports specifically to my computer to bypass the routers and set up a software firewall to re-establish the net.  My God!
2009-07-22T19:09:00.000Z	richardcavell	bastidrazor	I tend to agree
2009-07-22T19:10:00.000Z	bastidrazor	richardcavell	i'm watching my daughters. i don't have the time to do a howto in more detail.
2009-07-22T19:37:00.000Z	richardcavell	bastidrazor	I think he's gone
2009-07-22T19:38:00.000Z	richardcavell	bastidrazor	but so far as we can tell his new ubuntu install doesn't know that sda6 exits
2009-08-02T20:58:00.000Z	bastidrazor	richardcavell	does spamassassin work with empathy?
2009-08-02T20:58:00.000Z	richardcavell	bastidrazor	I don't know
2009-08-02T20:58:00.000Z	richardcavell	bastidrazor	But there ought to be an option to refuse messages from randoms
