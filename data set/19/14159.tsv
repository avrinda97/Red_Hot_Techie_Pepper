2012-04-26T22:46:00.000Z	varikonniemi		since 32 bit is slower, less secure, and will be severely restricted in capabilities when the 5y cycle of LTS is out
2012-04-26T22:46:00.000Z	varikonniemi		budget computers will have 16 gigs of ram and userspace runnign directly on ram etc
2012-04-26T22:47:00.000Z	varikonniemi		afaik 64bit version uses some protection mechanisms in 64 bit version
2012-04-26T22:47:00.000Z	varikonniemi		so some attacks are harder
2012-04-26T22:47:00.000Z	varikonniemi		Phoronix did extensive testing and it was WAY slower
2012-04-26T22:47:00.000Z	ogra_	varikonniemi	there was a survey before that decision was made ... more than a third of the ubuntu users used HW that wasnt 64bit capable
2012-04-26T22:48:00.000Z	ogra_	varikonniemi	it will be discussed at UDS, feel free to participate in the discussion
2012-04-26T22:50:00.000Z	ogra_	varikonniemi	well, you are free to change but you are also free to participate in public discussions and tell ubuntu devs why you thingk 32bit is less safe than 64
2012-04-26T22:50:00.000Z	ogra_	varikonniemi	a huge amount of ubuntu users lives in 3rd world countries
2012-04-26T22:51:00.000Z	ogra_	varikonniemi	thats one of the reasons ubuntu still defaults to CDs for example
2012-04-26T22:52:00.000Z	ogra_	varikonniemi	i have only one 64bit machine here out of 20 i run ... and thats a server ... all otrhers run 32bit and run unity just fine
2012-04-26T22:53:00.000Z	ogra_	varikonniemi	to make full use of 64bit your app needs to actually be written for using the extra registers
2012-04-26T22:53:00.000Z	ogra_	varikonniemi	i doubt more than 10% of the apps in the ubuntu archive actually do that
2012-04-26T22:54:00.000Z	ogra_	varikonniemi	tell that rto the app devs :)
2012-04-26T22:57:00.000Z	ogra_	varikonniemi	and how does that relate to 64bit ?
2012-04-26T22:58:00.000Z	ogra_	varikonniemi	thats not true
2012-04-26T22:58:00.000Z	ogra_	varikonniemi	and 32 vs 64 has nothing to do with unity speed (as you just said yourself, the code simply got more performant between two releases, nit related to 32 vs 64)
2012-04-26T23:00:00.000Z	ogra_	varikonniemi	unity runs just fine on an OMAP4 ARM cpu with 1G of ram (in 32bit)
2012-04-26T23:00:00.000Z	ogra_	varikonniemi	where exactly did you see unity on arm yet ?
