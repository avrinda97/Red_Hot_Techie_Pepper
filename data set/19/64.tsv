2012-10-24T05:15:00.000Z	physically_fit		guys why 12.10 doesn't appear in my update manager? i've been waiting, but wikipedia says it was released on 10/18. what should i do?
2012-10-24T05:17:00.000Z	PatrickDickey	physically_fit	Open Software Sources. On the "Updates" tab, change the notify me of new versions from LTS to "any" and it will prompt you after reloading.
2012-10-24T05:18:00.000Z	PatrickDickey	physically_fit	The default is Long Term Services only because typically the intermediates are "beta" versions. (I use that term VERY loosely).
2012-10-24T05:18:00.000Z	physically_fit	PatrickDickey	loadid, wilee-nilee got it! thank friends.
2012-10-24T05:19:00.000Z	PatrickDickey	physically_fit	make sure you read the release notes first.
2012-10-24T05:19:00.000Z	physically_fit	PatrickDickey	why?
2012-10-24T05:20:00.000Z	physically_fit	PatrickDickey	i just update
2012-10-24T05:20:00.000Z	PatrickDickey	physically_fit	because if you're using an older ATI card, you might run into issues.
2012-10-24T05:20:00.000Z	physically_fit	PatrickDickey	oh no, i am using an ATI indeed.
2012-10-24T05:21:00.000Z	PatrickDickey	physically_fit	which card is it?
2012-10-24T05:21:00.000Z	physically_fit	PatrickDickey	thanlks for warning
2012-10-24T05:22:00.000Z	physically_fit	PatrickDickey	 ATI Radeon Mobility X1400
2012-10-24T05:23:00.000Z	physically_fit	PatrickDickey	it's in my laptop i use for everything, watch movies connected to my tv.
2012-10-24T05:25:00.000Z	physically_fit	PatrickDickey	friend, i have an older desktop with ubuntu too. what thing didn't work in your desktop?
2012-10-24T05:26:00.000Z	physically_fit	PatrickDickey	now i am getting scared... but i'll update anyway both machines XD
2012-10-24T05:27:00.000Z	PatrickDickey	physically_fit	Do the laptop first (back it up before you start though). If it works, then do the desktop.  Don't do them at the same time.
2012-10-24T05:27:00.000Z	physically_fit	PatrickDickey	yeah i won't, i'll need the interwebs to search for help just in case...
2012-10-24T05:28:00.000Z	PatrickDickey	physically_fit	I can't emphasize the backup first part enough though. If it doesn't work, you may have to reinstall 12.04 (or whatever version you're on now).
2012-10-24T05:29:00.000Z	physically_fit	PatrickDickey	thanks friend for all your advices, you are so nice :)
