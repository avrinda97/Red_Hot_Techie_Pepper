2011-11-14T10:07:00.000Z	ok_wait		could someone be so kind and point me in the right direction to ask a question about ssh connections?
2011-11-14T10:08:00.000Z	brjannc	ok_wait	You can ask here :)
2011-11-14T10:15:00.000Z	brjannc	ok_wait	Generally speaking, if you ssh from A to B and run an X program, the program should show up on A.
2011-11-14T10:17:00.000Z	ok_wait	brjannc	would you know how to change that?
2011-11-14T10:21:00.000Z	brjannc	ok_wait	It depends on the program -- what are you running?
2011-11-14T10:22:00.000Z	ok_wait	brjannc	nautilus
2011-11-14T10:24:00.000Z	brjannc	ok_wait	one second
2011-11-14T10:25:00.000Z	brjannc	ok_wait	So, from computer B you're running "ssh -X user@A nautilus", and the nautilus window is showing up on A's screen, not B's?
2011-11-14T10:26:00.000Z	ok_wait	brjannc	yea and from a it shows up on a as well
2011-11-14T10:32:00.000Z	brjannc	ok_wait	I'm really not sure why that would happen -- it really shouldn't be. :)
2011-11-14T10:32:00.000Z	brjannc	ok_wait	(And sorry for having divided attention)
2011-11-14T10:33:00.000Z	brjannc	ok_wait	My only guess is to investigate the DISPLAY environment variable, which is what X programs use to determine where they should pop up.
2011-11-14T10:33:00.000Z	ok_wait	brjannc	that's ok, thank you for trying :)
2011-11-14T10:34:00.000Z	ok_wait	brjannc	ok i'll look into it thank you again
2011-11-14T10:35:00.000Z	brjannc	ok_wait	Sure thing, good luck!
2011-11-14T10:48:00.000Z	ok_wait	brjannc	would you know how i would execute 'xset dpms force off' for example on the remote machine?
2011-11-14T10:50:00.000Z	brjannc	ok_wait	You could try      ssh -X user@host "DISPLAY=:0 xset dpms force off"
2011-11-14T10:53:00.000Z	ok_wait	brjannc	that's perfect thank you very much
2011-11-14T10:54:00.000Z	brjannc	ok_wait	Sure thing :)
