2010-08-12T00:01:00.000Z	arrrghhh	g0th	why not put your entire response on ONE line?  crazy concept, i know.
2010-08-12T00:02:00.000Z	arrrghhh	g0th	assuming we know how to fix your issue, i think anyone will try and help.
2010-08-12T00:04:00.000Z	arrrghhh	g0th	i have no clue what that is... what are you trying to do?
2010-08-12T00:05:00.000Z	g0th	arrrghhh	I am trying to get a graphical interface working.
2010-08-12T00:09:00.000Z	arrrghhh	g0th	update-manager -d or do-release-upgrade from cli.
2010-08-12T00:11:00.000Z	arrrghhh	g0th	do what i told you!
2010-08-12T00:11:00.000Z	arrrghhh	g0th	did you put sudo in front of it?
2010-08-12T00:12:00.000Z	g0th	arrrghhh	I use linux since over 11 years, usually I dont make such mistakes as forgetting sudo
