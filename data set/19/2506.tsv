2010-03-17T00:56:00.000Z	idmclean		How do I view the files of another linux partition on the same computer?
2010-03-17T00:58:00.000Z	NewWorld	idmclean	 `sudo fdisk -l`, find out what partition it is (/dev/sd*). Then 'sudo mount [/dev/sd*] [directory to mount to]'
2010-03-17T01:00:00.000Z	idmclean	NewWorld	SnowmanX11, thanks. As an aside, do you know why it is that sometimes the other partitions on this computer get mounted but usually they do not?
2010-03-17T01:01:00.000Z	NewWorld	idmclean	 Dunno, but gnome-volume-manager handles auto-mounting in Ubuntu
2010-03-17T01:06:00.000Z	idmclean	NewWorld	what would be a directory I would want to mount to? "/"?
2010-03-17T01:07:00.000Z	NewWorld	idmclean	 Usually the directory would be created in /media/   but some use /mnt/
2010-03-17T01:10:00.000Z	idmclean	NewWorld	I'm using "mount -t ext3 /dev/sda2 /media/" it spat "wrong fs type, bad option...." back at me.
2010-03-17T01:11:00.000Z	NewWorld	idmclean	 'blkid [/dev/sd*] and see what FS type it is
2010-03-17T01:12:00.000Z	NewWorld	idmclean	 So like 'blkid /dev/sda3'
2010-03-17T01:12:00.000Z	idmclean	NewWorld	it accepted the command, but it gave no output.
2010-03-17T01:14:00.000Z	idmclean	NewWorld	I know the type is ext3.
2010-03-17T01:14:00.000Z	NewWorld	idmclean	 do 'sudo fdisk -l' again, and tell me what is in the 'System' column for the partition. It won't give any output for an extended partition, for example.
2010-03-17T01:15:00.000Z	NewWorld	idmclean	 Try mounting without mentioning type
2010-03-17T01:15:00.000Z	NewWorld	idmclean	 So no '-t ext3'
2010-03-17T01:16:00.000Z	idmclean	NewWorld	/dev/sda1 HPFS/NTFS (It's NTFS, WinXP) /dev/sda2 Extended, /dev/sda5 Linux
2010-03-17T01:16:00.000Z	NewWorld	idmclean	 So which SDA are you trying to mount?
2010-03-17T01:16:00.000Z	idmclean	NewWorld	I think I want to mount sda2.
2010-03-17T01:17:00.000Z	idmclean	NewWorld	also, it said must specify the filesystem type.
2010-03-17T01:17:00.000Z	NewWorld	idmclean	 /dev/sda2 is an extended partition. You can't mount those.
