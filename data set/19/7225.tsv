2010-07-22T20:31:00.000Z	maco	Nikon	er... instead of unicode, you mean?
2010-07-22T20:35:00.000Z	maco	Nikon	by extended ascii, do you mean the stuff microsoft made up thats nonstandard?
2010-07-22T20:35:00.000Z	Nikon	maco	i mean http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_ASCII
2010-07-22T20:37:00.000Z	maco	Nikon	ok so you'll likely need to know *which* extended ascii you mean (as the wikipedia link you gave points out, there are plenty, and there is no standard), though i do wonder why youd rather do this than just use unicode like the rest of the world-that-needs-more-than-english
2010-07-22T20:38:00.000Z	Nikon	maco	i am trying to connect to bbs's that use ANSI art, which causes a flurry of question mark characters and makes the display indecipherable

2010-07-22T20:45:00.000Z	maco	Nikon	assuming ISO-8895-1 is the right version of extended ascii
2010-07-22T20:46:00.000Z	Nikon	maco	this caused a change, but for the worse unfortunately. now color is unsupported
2010-07-22T20:47:00.000Z	maco	Nikon	yep
2010-07-22T20:47:00.000Z	Nikon	maco	ok. thank you for helping me :)
2010-11-19T06:30:00.000Z	maco	Nikon	G1Bs0N:  this isnt a channel for idle chatter. it's for tech support *only*.  please go to #ubuntu-offtopic or use a PM if you just want to talk
2010-11-19T06:34:00.000Z	maco	Nikon	what?
2010-11-19T06:34:00.000Z	maco	Nikon	no
2010-11-19T06:35:00.000Z	maco	Nikon	xrdodrx has done nothing to justify a removal. please try not to justify your own removal either.
2010-11-19T06:37:00.000Z	Nikon	maco	where can i file a complaint to get xrdodrx removed ?
2010-11-19T06:37:00.000Z	maco	Nikon	im watching the channel and you have no grounds. please get onto the topic of tech support.
