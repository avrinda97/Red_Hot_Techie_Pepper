2008-09-27T15:12:00.000Z	airtonix	wers	no...s-video is limited to 640-480 and even then  its not the same as vga 640-480
2008-09-27T15:14:00.000Z	airtonix	wers	well even so it depends on your display ... i once helped a guy run a clone to his widescreen tv whihc had a vga input....but the controller on the tv for the vga port was only analouge...so the picture was quite bad
2008-10-03T12:26:00.000Z	airtonix	wers	use transmission...
2008-10-03T12:27:00.000Z	wers	airtonix	i use that. i just want to access the files i downloaded using utorrent under wine
2008-10-03T12:27:00.000Z	airtonix	wers	download lastest transmission from their website..i just peformed the operation your talking about
2008-10-03T12:29:00.000Z	airtonix	wers	you have to first specify a folder in the transmission config for where downloads are stored, then you load up transmissionm, then you move the current data for a torrent to that download folder and then..you load the .torrent file and press go/save/download
2008-10-03T12:29:00.000Z	wers	airtonix	i dont care about transmission. my objective is to access the files i _already_ downloaded with utorrent
2008-10-03T12:30:00.000Z	airtonix	wers	then ask in #uTorrent
2008-10-03T12:30:00.000Z	airtonix	wers	transmission is practically a utorrent clone
2008-10-03T12:31:00.000Z	wers	airtonix	that's what i always use. i'm just trying to play with utorrent in such a way that i would be able to use it in both my windows and ubuntu partition with the same config files
2008-10-03T12:31:00.000Z	airtonix	wers	and i am telling you that regardless of your torrent client..the currently downloaded data for a torrent is able to be read and continued by any torrent app
2008-10-03T12:31:00.000Z	wers	airtonix	oh. that's good. thanks
2008-10-03T12:31:00.000Z	airtonix	wers	and transmission is also available for windows afaik
2008-10-03T12:32:00.000Z	wers	airtonix	dont worry. i'm using utorrent on windows. hehe
2008-10-03T12:32:00.000Z	wers	airtonix	its just good to know that i can continue downloading on ubuntu with another client like transmission
2008-10-03T12:33:00.000Z	airtonix	wers	all good, just so you know...transmission is compatiable with utorrent dht and pex data also....which only applies while downloads are in affect
2008-10-03T12:34:00.000Z	airtonix	wers	rTorrent will also do this....but my reason for using rTorrent is for the cli, which transmission also has... including a webinterface
2008-10-03T12:34:00.000Z	airtonix	wers	but like i said, any torrent app worth its salt will continue since its a has check based on the .torrent file
