2007-10-28T01:39:00.000Z	Joshooa		Ok can I PLEASE get some help running World of Warcraft on Ubuntu!?
2007-10-28T01:39:00.000Z	ItchyHobo	Joshooa	get wine
2007-10-28T01:39:00.000Z	Joshooa		I had it running under 7.04 but now I can't do it at all, it just gives me an error message
2007-10-28T01:40:00.000Z	Joshooa	ItchyHobo	I have it
2007-10-28T01:40:00.000Z	ItchyHobo		hmm and did world of warcraft install ok
2007-10-28T01:40:00.000Z	Joshooa	ItchyHobo	It installed great, updated itself which surprised me before it didn't, but now it wont open at all
2007-10-28T01:40:00.000Z	Joshooa	ItchyHobo	I can't edit the config file to make it opengl all the time but I add the command but I can't get it to open at all and I do not want Windows and I do not want to cancel wow
2007-10-28T01:41:00.000Z	ItchyHobo	Joshooa	there is a little problem in wine it does not select the default working directory in some cases
2007-10-28T01:41:00.000Z	ItchyHobo	Joshooa	try running it from the terminal but change to the installed directory first
2007-10-28T01:41:00.000Z	Joshooa	ItchyHobo	Well, do you play WoW? It opens it's little window, it shows me the news about wow and everything, then I hit play, and it goes to load it,..... I wait for up to 10 minnutes then get an error back and it wants me to send it in
2007-10-28T01:42:00.000Z	Joshooa	ItchyHobo	Trying from the directory
2007-10-28T01:42:00.000Z	ItchyHobo	Joshooa	used to play WOW loved it but not tried it since ubuntu; anyway whats the error message
2007-10-28T01:43:00.000Z	Joshooa	ItchyHobo	Well I'll let you knowp when i get it, I forgot to do opengl now though so it's talking about that.. just sitting there
2007-10-28T01:43:00.000Z	Joshooa	ItchyHobo	What's that one site I can past code to and send you the link, do you know?
2007-10-28T01:44:00.000Z	ItchyHobo	Joshooa	http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=application&iId=1922
2007-10-28T01:44:00.000Z	ItchyHobo		use this to get to the forums
2007-10-28T01:44:00.000Z	ItchyHobo	Joshooa	wow has gold support it should work nicely
2007-10-28T01:46:00.000Z	Joshooa	ItchyHobo	Well it doesn't and it makes me sad. I'm sure it can, but there's some setting or something I gotta change, because it worked great back in 7.04 with the old Wine, better than in Windows, higher FPS and everything, with higher settings
2007-10-28T01:48:00.000Z	ItchyHobo	Joshooa	guess so anyway good luck
