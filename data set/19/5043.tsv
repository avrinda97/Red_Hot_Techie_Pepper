2008-09-18T02:18:00.000Z	roukoun	bobertdos	like what?
2008-09-18T02:19:00.000Z	bobertdos	roukoun	For editors? Well, it requires the Java Runtime environment, but I really rely on jEdit.
2008-09-18T02:20:00.000Z	roukoun	bobertdos	i tried 'apt-cache search jedit' but there wasnt any result. i'd like to try it...
2008-09-18T02:21:00.000Z	roukoun	bobertdos	is it coming with the ubuntu 7.10 repos?
2008-09-18T02:22:00.000Z	bobertdos	roukoun	The version available on the website is more current than the repos anyway. Go to jedit.org and download the latest deb of their development release (4.3pre15). Use sudo dpkg -i <filename> in the terminal to install it. You'll need at least Java 5.
2008-09-18T02:23:00.000Z	roukoun	bobertdos	thanks.... i will use it and i'll tell tou my opinion!
2008-09-18T02:23:00.000Z	bobertdos	roukoun	Well, that depends on what you want to do. Usually, the only reason to dig really deep into the filesystem is when you're trying to fix something.
2008-09-18T02:26:00.000Z	roukoun	bobertdos	i use text editors as a web developer and my favorite one is bluefish but when you want to modify a file like logs, from the console, then you have to use something flexible and easy to use... so i'm trying to find something like this. i'm using nano for now
2008-09-18T02:27:00.000Z	bobertdos	roukoun	vi and vim are more robust, but in my opinion they're a bit awkward. You can use gksudo with graphical editors when you're editing config files too.
2008-09-18T02:37:00.000Z	bobertdos	roukoun	How did you install flash? From the repos?
2008-09-18T02:39:00.000Z	roukoun	bobertdos	i installed flashplugin-nonfree from the repos and i downloades the .bin file from adobe
2008-09-18T02:39:00.000Z	bobertdos	roukoun	and how did you install Opera?
2008-09-18T02:39:00.000Z	roukoun	bobertdos	from the repos
2008-09-18T02:40:00.000Z	bobertdos	roukoun	Well, it would seem we need to make some links.
2008-09-18T02:42:00.000Z	roukoun	bobertdos	i think that something is going wrong with java installation cause i have some other problems with programs that use java too. anyway tell me what you have in mind!
2008-09-18T02:43:00.000Z	bobertdos	roukoun	I'm getting really sick of being in the channel. You can PM me if you want. I've cramped myself in here all day :p
2008-09-29T02:23:00.000Z	bobertdos	roukoun	Use Synaptic to purge all old flash versions and make sure 9.0_r124 is the only one installed.
2008-09-29T06:28:00.000Z	bobertdos	roukoun	That's almost a better question for a dev channel.
2008-09-29T06:28:00.000Z	roukoun	bobertdos	ok
