2011-09-19T23:46:00.000Z	Kronsby		My ubuntu keeps freezing up. Maybe once per day. audio always loops and you must force restart
2011-09-19T23:47:00.000Z	Kronsby		What do?
2011-09-19T23:48:00.000Z	Kronsby		How can I figure out why my computer froze?
2011-09-19T23:49:00.000Z	BarkingFish	Kronsby	does it only freeze when you are using certain programmes, or does it happen at random?
2011-09-19T23:49:00.000Z	Kronsby	BarkingFish	It is random
2011-09-19T23:49:00.000Z	Kronsby	BarkingFish	I have my system monitors on and nothing irregular happens. No spikes or anything
2011-09-19T23:49:00.000Z	Kronsby		In ram or processor that is
2011-09-19T23:50:00.000Z	BarkingFish		have you checked your system logs to see if anything weird is being recorded in them?
2011-09-19T23:50:00.000Z	BarkingFish		^Kronsby
2011-09-19T23:50:00.000Z	Kronsby	BarkingFish	how do I do that?
2011-09-19T23:51:00.000Z	BarkingFish	Kronsby	if you open a terminal and go to /var/log , you will find various logs in there containing details of your system, messages from the kernel and so on
2011-09-19T23:52:00.000Z	Kronsby	BarkingFish	What would I be looking for?
2011-09-19T23:53:00.000Z	Kronsby	BarkingFish	faillog?
2011-09-19T23:53:00.000Z	BarkingFish		Anything happening to your system would likely be in your syslog - perhaps look for errors in the log file, or maybe in the output from your kernel.
2011-09-19T23:53:00.000Z	BarkingFish	Kronsby	I have no idea on that one, never seen it or read it :)
2011-09-19T23:53:00.000Z	BarkingFish		quick answer - no
2011-09-19T23:54:00.000Z	BarkingFish		if you did that as root, you lost whatever you did it on, trinimoses
2011-09-19T23:55:00.000Z	Kronsby	BarkingFish	I see that the time that it froze my network manager completing-> group handshake
2011-09-19T23:56:00.000Z	BarkingFish	Kronsby	are you connecting via Wireless or via a cabled connection?
