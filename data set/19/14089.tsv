2005-09-12T07:12:00.000Z	LaGodactyl		I installed ubuntu on 1 partition, then I installed Windows on the other, and it boots straight into Windows, not even asking what I should boot into.
2005-09-12T07:12:00.000Z	LaGodactyl		so, should i reinstall ubuntu?
2005-09-12T07:13:00.000Z	SuperQ	LaGodactyl	no

2005-09-12T07:13:00.000Z	SuperQ	LaGodactyl	do you have the ubuntu live CD?
2005-09-12T07:13:00.000Z	SuperQ	LaGodactyl	do you remember where your root filesystem is?

2005-09-12T07:14:00.000Z	SuperQ	LaGodactyl	yea.. installing windows after linux will wipe the MBR

2005-09-12T07:15:00.000Z	SuperQ	LaGodactyl	administrative tools::computer managment::disk managment
2005-09-12T07:16:00.000Z	SuperQ	LaGodactyl	you should be able to set the "bootable flag" for the ubuntu partition
2005-09-12T07:17:00.000Z	SuperQ	LaGodactyl	did you find the "bootable" option in disk managment?
2005-09-12T07:17:00.000Z	SuperQ	LaGodactyl	it might be under the right-click menu
2005-09-12T07:20:00.000Z	SuperQ	LaGodactyl	you should be able to do a grub-install to fix the partition
2005-09-12T07:20:00.000Z	SuperQ	LaGodactyl	it's more complicated
2005-09-12T07:20:00.000Z	SuperQ	LaGodactyl	you could just re-install
2005-09-12T07:21:00.000Z	SuperQ	LaGodactyl	if you have nothing invested in the ubuntu install
2005-09-12T07:21:00.000Z	SuperQ	LaGodactyl	I always install windows first on dual-boot machines
