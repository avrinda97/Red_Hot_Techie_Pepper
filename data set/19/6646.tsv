2008-01-05T04:12:00.000Z	Pelo	linuxperson11	check the grub menu.lst file and see if you splash in the line to boot the kernel you are using
2008-01-05T04:15:00.000Z	Pelo	linuxperson11	gksu gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst
2008-01-05T04:16:00.000Z	Pelo	linuxperson11	scroll down to where the lines aren't mostly commented out with # ,  that should be where the actualy menu item listing start,  check the long command line, toward the end, look for the word splash
