2007-11-18T02:36:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	tyronepolleri	Are you buying or selling?
2007-11-18T02:36:00.000Z	tyronepolleri	ArthurArchnix	I have a problem with my webcam and I was wondering if someone can help me
2007-11-18T02:39:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	tyronepolleri	Have you tried this link: http://janpatulinux.blogspot.com/2007/10/hp-pavilion-dv-2500-webcam-driver-for.html
2007-11-18T02:41:00.000Z	tyronepolleri	ArthurArchnix	what does modprobe uvcvideo do?
2007-11-18T02:41:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	tyronepolleri	Once you have correctly built a "module" (aka driver) that loads it so that it is available to be used by your system.
2007-11-18T02:42:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	tyronepolleri	So that command is telling your kernel to load that module so that it knows how to run the associated hardware.
2007-11-18T02:43:00.000Z	tyronepolleri	ArthurArchnix	thank you, but well i tried already to follow those instructions and my webcam is still not working
2007-11-18T02:43:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	tyronepolleri	I don't see a driver available for download on that page. Where did you find it?
2007-11-18T02:44:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	tyronepolleri	Use pastebin and post the output of lspci we can then search for drivers using more specific search terms than just your laptop model.
2007-11-18T02:46:00.000Z	tyronepolleri	ArthurArchnix	I am sorry but what is pastebin ?
2007-11-18T02:48:00.000Z	tyronepolleri	ArthurArchnix	thanks I'll put it there and send you the link
