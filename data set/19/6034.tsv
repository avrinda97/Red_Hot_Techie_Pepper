2008-03-26T01:45:00.000Z	BobTheBruin		Can anyone help with my gutsy machine that now will not boot up.  I get the error message "Starting up...  [1.080000] Kernel panic - not syncing: VPS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(0,0)
2008-03-26T01:46:00.000Z	BobTheBruin		not really
2008-03-26T01:46:00.000Z	BobTheBruin		it was just a reboot
2008-03-26T01:47:00.000Z	BobTheBruin		I am not the only one who uses it, but I am guessing it was after an update
2008-03-26T01:49:00.000Z	captainm	BobTheBruin	maybe a problem with grub.conf

2008-03-26T01:56:00.000Z	captainm	BobTheBruin	Could you boot into the rescue cd and pastebin menu.lst/ grub.conf?
2008-03-26T02:00:00.000Z	captainm	BobTheBruin	have you chrooted in your environment already?
2008-03-26T02:03:00.000Z	captainm	BobTheBruin	are you still there?
2008-03-26T02:03:00.000Z	BobTheBruin	captainm	how do you chroot your environment?
2008-03-26T02:04:00.000Z	captainm	BobTheBruin	first make sure the drive with ubuntu on it is mounted
2008-03-26T02:04:00.000Z	captainm	BobTheBruin	does it show up on your desktop?
2008-03-26T02:05:00.000Z	captainm	BobTheBruin	ok. now in a terminal type: sudo chroot /media/disk /bin/bash
2008-03-26T02:07:00.000Z	captainm	BobTheBruin	could you type my name before you say something to me? that'll make it easier to see you in the see of comments. You can use tab to autocomplete my name
2008-03-26T02:07:00.000Z	BobTheBruin	captainm	sure sorry
2008-03-26T02:07:00.000Z	BobTheBruin	captainm	it is done
2008-03-26T02:07:00.000Z	captainm	BobTheBruin	now in a terminal type: update-grub -y
2008-03-26T02:09:00.000Z	BobTheBruin	captainm	it has some problems with permission denied and "cannot determine root device, this error is probably caused by an invalid /etc/fstab"
2008-03-26T02:13:00.000Z	captainm	BobTheBruin	hischild Good luck!
