2010-03-15T23:42:00.000Z	Slart	neo__	you should write your question on 1 line.. if you don't get an answer you should wait 10-15 minutes before repeating.. use the time to search forums, improve the question, provide more details and so on
2010-03-15T23:42:00.000Z	Slart	neo__	the floodbot reacts to several lines by the same person within a short period of time.
2010-03-15T23:42:00.000Z	neo__		Slart:I have been working on this problem for a week or so
2010-03-15T23:43:00.000Z	neo__		did not get any solution..pardon me
2010-03-15T23:44:00.000Z	Slart	neo__	from the 4 lines you wrote before I can't really say if I know the answer to your problem or not.. provide details about version of ubuntu, error messages, what you're trying to achieve and so on
2010-03-15T23:45:00.000Z	neo__	Slart	I installed ubuntu using Wubi .Now when iremoved it and tried normal install,the bootloader does not detect the new version...how do i remove the previous GRUB n replace the WUBI grub with a normal one
2010-03-15T23:46:00.000Z	neo__		problem is with Grub not WUbi
2010-03-15T23:47:00.000Z	Slart	neo__	I have no idea what wubi does or how it handles grub and booting.. on a normal system you run "sudo update-grub" and it looks around for operating systems to boot and puts them in a boot menu
2010-03-15T23:47:00.000Z	neo__	Slart	: Also Wubi has a limited space of #) GB only for ubuntu...i need to give it 50 GB how do i do it???? any idea...my drive on which ubuntu is stored is a 50 gb drive....
