2005-11-29T06:30:00.000Z	thoreauputic	cion	check alsamixer for muted channels or openthe gnome mixer
2005-11-29T08:19:00.000Z	thoreauputic	cion	you normally put all your data in your home directory
2005-11-29T08:19:00.000Z	thoreauputic	cion	what kind of data?
2005-11-29T08:20:00.000Z	thoreauputic	cion	keep them in your personal home directory then
2005-11-29T08:21:00.000Z	thoreauputic	cion	that's the only sensible place - it will give you full access
2005-11-29T08:21:00.000Z	thoreauputic	cion	yes  /home/cion  or whatever your user name is
2006-05-13T15:00:00.000Z	thoreauputic	cion	ekiga/ gnome-meeting probabl;y
2006-05-13T15:00:00.000Z	cion	thoreauputic	ekiga is good to talk with windows users?
2006-05-13T15:01:00.000Z	thoreauputic	cion	I know you could use gnome-meeting - ekiga is basically the same app
2006-05-13T15:02:00.000Z	cion	thoreauputic	so if i use ekiga what software do windows user have to install?
2006-05-13T15:02:00.000Z	thoreauputic	cion	not sure - netmeeting I think
2006-05-13T15:02:00.000Z	thoreauputic	cion	but I haven't tried it so...
2006-05-13T15:03:00.000Z	thoreauputic	cion	what is the problem with skype? Skype is proprietary so it isn't fixable from our end
