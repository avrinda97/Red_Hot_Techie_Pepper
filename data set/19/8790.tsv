2009-11-09T00:51:00.000Z	BluesKaj	arand	it's called other software on janty and karmic
2009-11-09T00:52:00.000Z	arand	BluesKaj	BluesKaj not on my jaunty.
2009-11-09T00:53:00.000Z	BluesKaj	arand	check you pckage manager again
2009-11-09T00:54:00.000Z	arand	BluesKaj	in my software sources I clearly read "Third-party Software". I'm sticking with my case there.
2009-11-09T00:55:00.000Z	BluesKaj	arand	,in which package manager do see thirdpary software
2009-11-09T00:56:00.000Z	arand	BluesKaj	"Software Sources"-config Jaunty (diff US-UK?)
2009-12-11T21:19:00.000Z	arand	BluesKaj	I normally use VLC...
2009-12-11T21:20:00.000Z	BluesKaj	arand	VLC doesn't play the video , only the audio
2009-12-11T21:21:00.000Z	arand	BluesKaj	Next step, mplayer?
2009-12-11T21:21:00.000Z	BluesKaj	arand	yeah, maybe , but I haven't seen a stable mplayer in several versions
2009-12-11T21:24:00.000Z	arand	BluesKaj	you might at least be able to convert it... By the way,I've had a lot of flvs simply come out as corrupted in one way or other, so redownloading, or even waiting a day and then redownloading (experience with youtube) might get you a proper version, all depnding on what/where the file is...
2009-12-11T21:25:00.000Z	BluesKaj	arand	there's an app called youtubedl , (I think) ..
2009-12-11T21:26:00.000Z	BluesKaj	arand	or you could always use the FF tmp file to dl after the file has fifnished buffering
2009-12-11T21:28:00.000Z	arand	BluesKaj	Hmm, I'm confused now, it was you that was asking for help right? :D
2009-12-11T21:30:00.000Z	BluesKaj	arand	well, I just have one ptoblem and that's with flv file playback , after downloading
2009-12-11T21:31:00.000Z	arand	BluesKaj	mhm, and it might be that your file is corrupted there, was what I was implying.
2009-12-11T21:31:00.000Z	BluesKaj	arand	the audio portion plays on vlc, but not the video
2009-12-11T22:02:00.000Z	BluesKaj	arand	 fixed my VLC problem ..flv plays now ...seems there's a 20sec delay til the video activates dunno why
2009-12-11T22:03:00.000Z	arand	BluesKaj	heh... well, wonder if converting it to another format might fixit.
