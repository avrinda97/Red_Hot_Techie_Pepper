2009-12-19T01:35:00.000Z	Vonnick		Need some help... I'm running Hardy and I can't open anything as root. Like sudo nautilus. It just hangs, so what's going on?
2009-12-19T01:36:00.000Z	Scunizi	Vonnick	how 'bout gksudo nautilus?
2009-12-19T01:36:00.000Z	Vonnick		gksudo does the same thing
2009-12-19T01:37:00.000Z	Scunizi	Vonnick	did you happen to create a root login at one point?
2009-12-19T01:37:00.000Z	Vonnick		Nope. I just installed
2009-12-19T01:37:00.000Z	Scunizi	Vonnick	you don't still have the cd in the drive do you?
2009-12-19T01:38:00.000Z	Vonnick	Scunizi	Nope, checked em all
2009-12-19T01:38:00.000Z	Scunizi	Vonnick	have you done all your updates?
2009-12-19T01:38:00.000Z	Vonnick		Yes
2009-12-19T01:38:00.000Z	Scunizi	Vonnick	very weird.. outside of suggesting a reboot that probably won't do anything.. I"m at a loss.
2009-12-19T01:39:00.000Z	Vonnick	Scunizi	Rebooted way to many times already :(
2009-12-19T01:39:00.000Z	Scunizi	Vonnick	what are you using nautilus for at root?
2009-12-19T01:40:00.000Z	Vonnick	Scunizi	So I can replace some files for Gimp
2009-12-19T01:40:00.000Z	Scunizi	Vonnick	replace? are they newer/older or just missing?
2009-12-19T01:41:00.000Z	Vonnick	Scunizi	Neither :P I'm replacing the splash image for my friend
2009-12-19T01:41:00.000Z	Scunizi	Vonnick	have you tried from the terminal? sudo cp <path to file> <path to new location>
2009-12-19T01:42:00.000Z	Vonnick		Yeah, I've already replaced it
2009-12-19T01:42:00.000Z	Vonnick		But I'd like to know why I can't open anything as root :P
2009-12-19T01:42:00.000Z	Scunizi	Vonnick	someone else will have to take up the banner on this one.. at least sudo works.
