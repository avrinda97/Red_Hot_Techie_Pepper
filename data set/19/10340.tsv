2007-07-26T10:59:00.000Z	Some_Person		i cant move it, i cant copy/paste it, it has less than half a gig free space, theres nothing i can do

2007-07-26T11:00:00.000Z	Some_Person		i do not want to reinstall
2007-07-26T11:01:00.000Z	Some_Person		but i need more free space
2007-07-26T11:03:00.000Z	coopster	Some_Person	...what's the problem?  why can't you just use gparted to move the ext3 partition so that the free space is at the end, and then resize it?
2007-07-26T11:03:00.000Z	Some_Person	coopster	it wont let me
2007-07-26T11:03:00.000Z	coopster	Some_Person	need to be more specific.  does it slap your hand when you try, or what?
2007-07-26T11:04:00.000Z	Some_Person	coopster	i choose resize/move, and it just wont let me move it
2007-07-26T11:06:00.000Z	coopster	Some_Person	dunno.  copy the partition to either another drive, repartition the one you need, and copy it back.
2007-07-26T11:07:00.000Z	Some_Person	coopster	I DONT HAVE ANOTHER DRIVE FOR THE 3RD TIME
2007-07-26T11:07:00.000Z	Some_Person	coopster	i dont have another drive
2007-07-26T11:07:00.000Z	coopster	Some_Person	so, accept the fact that you've screwed up by not planning ahead.  you'd have to pay me for help before you get to yell at me.  good luck/
2007-07-26T11:08:00.000Z	Some_Person	coopster	not planning ahead?
