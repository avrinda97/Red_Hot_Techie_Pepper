2010-05-19T21:45:00.000Z	phillyj		how do i remove a program? I ran "make clean" and then "make distclean" as was said in the install file but the folder is still there
2010-05-19T21:45:00.000Z	jrib	phillyj	I assume you didn't use apt to install it?
2010-05-19T21:47:00.000Z	jrib	phillyj	why?  You should always use APT whenever possible.  To remove it, you'll have to read tho software's documentation.  Sometimes developers include a "make uninstall" rule.  When they don't you must delete the files yourself
2010-05-19T21:53:00.000Z	phillyj	jrib	it wasn't a file i could use apt with
2010-05-19T21:53:00.000Z	jrib	phillyj	what exactly was it?
2010-05-19T21:56:00.000Z	phillyj	jrib	it was a FFTW; a Fourier Transform library
2010-05-19T21:56:00.000Z	jrib	phillyj	there are plenty of those, you're being vague
2010-05-19T21:57:00.000Z	phillyj	jrib	a C subroutine library
2010-05-19T21:57:00.000Z	phillyj	jrib	I installed a newer version but i needed an older version
2010-05-19T21:58:00.000Z	phillyj	jrib	yes but i needed 2.x.x version
2010-05-19T21:59:00.000Z	jrib	phillyj	no, it's available in the repositories
2010-05-19T21:59:00.000Z	phillyj	jrib	so i use apt get?
2010-05-19T21:59:00.000Z	jrib	phillyj	if you want to install it, sure
2010-05-19T22:01:00.000Z	phillyj	jrib	so what should i type? apt-get 2.1.3?
2010-05-19T22:02:00.000Z	jrib	phillyj	you can use Software Center if you aren't comfortable using apt-get
2010-05-19T22:03:00.000Z	phillyj	jrib	back to my 1st question; should i remove the folder fftw-3.2.2? and how?
2010-05-19T22:04:00.000Z	jrib	phillyj	as I said before: To remove it, you'll have to read tho software's documentation.  Sometimes developers include a "make uninstall" rule.  When they don't you must delete the files yourself
2010-05-19T22:05:00.000Z	phillyj	jrib	o ic; i can't find the fftw 2.1.3 in the software center; i'll try apt-get
2010-05-19T22:06:00.000Z	jrib	phillyj	the package name is fftw2.  There's also sfftw2 but I don't know the difference.  You'll have to check that
