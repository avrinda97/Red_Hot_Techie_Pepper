2009-08-06T00:44:00.000Z	bucky	jacquesdupontd	to to community college and take DOS 101 to familiarize youself with the concept of working directory
2009-08-06T00:45:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	bucky	i've learnt all step by step as i was needing it time after time but it can be useful thx for the advice, anyway i always found a solution even if i don't go the faster way
2009-08-06T00:46:00.000Z	bucky	jacquesdupontd	this is NOT your home directory "~/home/jacques"
2009-08-06T00:46:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	bucky	for sure i know
2009-08-06T00:46:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	bucky	read me i made a mistake on 1 sentence just because of attention
2009-08-06T00:46:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	bucky	i use linux since 5 years
2009-08-06T00:47:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	bucky	i know its either /home/jacquesdupontd/ or ~/ i learnt him about the ~/ just upper in the discussino
2009-08-06T00:49:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	bucky	btw i've seen something im not sure about, before on other version of ubuntu in the terminal when i was typing ~/ + tab then it was putting me the user directory but now you have to directly put the next directory you want to go to, it's pretty much the same but i don't know the explanation of this change
2009-08-06T00:51:00.000Z	bucky	jacquesdupontd	cd ../  pwd   cd ~/  pwd
2009-08-06T00:54:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	bucky	i expressed myself wrongly but that doesn't matter anyway
2009-08-06T01:03:00.000Z	bucky	jacquesdupontd	ls ~/  <TAB>    Display all 197 possibilities? (y or n)
2009-08-06T01:05:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	bucky	im saying before, you were typing "cd ~/ + tab" and it was becoming "cd /home/userdir/" i know all this command to list folders
2009-10-06T22:19:00.000Z	bucky	jacquesdupontd	do you have integrated intel graphics?
2009-10-06T22:22:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	bucky	no nvidia and it's working perfectly sometimes during 30 minutes it doesn't matter i just doesn't understand or i understand that the buffer is too big and instead of just needing the speed of downloading it at his time life speed which means not more than 100ko/s at all , do you undersand ?
2009-10-06T22:24:00.000Z	bucky	jacquesdupontd	mess around with the settings in Preferences=>Tools=>Input & Codecs including Cacheing
2009-10-06T22:24:00.000Z	bucky	jacquesdupontd	you need more cacheing... because avi is an uncompressed pig
2009-10-06T22:25:00.000Z	bucky	jacquesdupontd	and 300 kb/s is small
2009-10-06T22:25:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	bucky	thx i will need you then, i just think i can do better
2009-10-06T22:26:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	bucky	highest latency or lowest ?
