2007-07-17T13:03:00.000Z	shiester_miester	ljsmithx	relatively powerful 3d acceleration and a good cpu
2007-07-17T13:03:00.000Z	shiester_miester	ljsmithx	you dont need a BEAST, but it won't run very well at all if you have an old box
2007-07-17T13:03:00.000Z	shiester_miester	ljsmithx	at least some 3d hardware acceleration is required
2007-07-17T13:40:00.000Z	shiester_miester	ljsmithx	good luck
