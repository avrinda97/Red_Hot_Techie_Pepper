2006-06-03T16:25:00.000Z	Fujitsu		svn diff gives you the global changes.

2006-06-03T16:30:00.000Z	Fujitsu		svn is great. Source Safe is really terrible.
2006-06-03T16:32:00.000Z	h3sp4wn	Fujitsu	which was the one linus used to have but they stoped giving home ? Is that sourcesafe ?
2006-06-03T16:33:00.000Z	Fujitsu	h3sp4wn	if you've got money...
2006-06-03T16:35:00.000Z	Fujitsu	h3sp4wn	nobody's quite sure.
2006-06-04T05:33:00.000Z	Fujitsu	h3sp4wn	why not try to get GRUB working?
2006-06-04T05:34:00.000Z	h3sp4wn	Fujitsu	I think it would be good to have an opensource bios (which u-boot is) I didn't say it would be easy tho
2006-06-04T05:34:00.000Z	Fujitsu	h3sp4wn	we're not trying to complicate things.
2006-06-04T05:35:00.000Z	h3sp4wn	Fujitsu	Do you not find complicated stuff more interesting ? (grub is fine for me anyway always)
2006-06-04T05:35:00.000Z	Fujitsu	h3sp4wn	I find broken stuff more interesting... That's why I'm here :)
2006-06-04T05:36:00.000Z	h3sp4wn	Fujitsu	Installing u-boot would certain break things in the first instance
