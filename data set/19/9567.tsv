2006-10-21T11:50:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle		Well, I seem to be getting owned by this...BHS, what do I do to run it?
2006-10-21T11:50:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle		Well, see, I just entered sh ConversionScript into a terminal.
2006-10-21T11:50:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle		And it tossed me the message
2006-10-21T11:50:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle		No files with extension m4a in this directory.
2006-10-21T11:51:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle		So I'm wondering where I add in the modifications to that to specify folder.
2006-10-21T11:51:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle		Because it WORKS, I'm just not entering it in right.
2006-10-21T11:51:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle		And according to the link, it says to use aac2mp3 -h for the help file.
2006-10-21T11:52:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle		Its not able to select the directory. And I'm not sure how to open the help file, which the site says is "aac2mp3 -h"
2006-10-21T11:52:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle		I just enter that into the terminal or what?
