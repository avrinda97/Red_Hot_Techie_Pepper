2009-05-10T12:50:00.000Z	roadmap		Different kernels from the looks of it I guess.
2009-05-10T12:51:00.000Z	Eevee	roadmap	well ubuntu IS a bit of a litterbug with its kernels
2009-05-10T12:51:00.000Z	roadmap	Eevee	I won't deny that.
2009-05-10T13:12:00.000Z	roadmap	Eevee	Doesn't Ubuntu use HAL for automounting devices?
2009-05-10T13:12:00.000Z	Eevee	roadmap	yes as I discovered about four minutes ago
2009-05-10T13:12:00.000Z	roadmap	Eevee	If Hal is whats autmounting the devices shouldn't he be able to change it by editing the hal configurations?
2009-05-10T13:13:00.000Z	roadmap	Eevee	I have some fun experience with hal. I've never played with how its setup on Ubuntu, but if he wants to change the default automount point there is a way.
2009-05-10T13:13:00.000Z	Eevee	roadmap	my highly detailed search (ack -a media /etc/hal) didn't find anything useful
2009-05-10T13:14:00.000Z	roadmap	Eevee	I don't think /etc/hal is the right place to look. Let me take a look at it. I may be wrong :).
2009-05-10T13:14:00.000Z	roadmap	Eevee	debian logic baffles the mind.
2009-05-10T13:14:00.000Z	Eevee	roadmap	my experience with HAL consists mainly of not needing to know it exists, so
2009-05-10T13:14:00.000Z	roadmap	Eevee	Well you have now known for well over four minutes. Congratulations.
2009-05-10T13:15:00.000Z	Eevee	roadmap	well I KNEW, I just didn't NEED to  :P  clearly it is doing a good job
2009-05-10T13:19:00.000Z	roadmap	Eevee	I think its architecture related. I think Ubuntu requires i686 compatibility.
2009-05-10T13:20:00.000Z	Eevee	roadmap	I've never read anything to that effect but I don't know that you're wrong either
2009-05-10T13:20:00.000Z	roadmap	Eevee	Again, It could be other distros I've used (like Arch) that require i686 and Ubuntu is more architecture friendly.
2009-05-10T13:26:00.000Z	roadmap	Eevee	I've seen torrent clients freak out and go over 100% on a file before (120% complete? Somethings wrong). I've also seen it claim 100% and still missing a piece or two.
2009-05-10T13:27:00.000Z	roadmap	Eevee	He very easily could have jump the gun on the "Complete" from a torrent client :).
2009-05-10T13:43:00.000Z	roadmap	Eevee	Stay out of my closet.
