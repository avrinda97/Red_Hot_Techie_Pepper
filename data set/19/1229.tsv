2011-04-25T19:20:00.000Z	tjiggi_fo	jubei-za	I'm on 10.04 and it's in Lucid-Security/main in Synaptic
2011-04-25T19:21:00.000Z	jubei-za	tjiggi_fo	im on 10.04 server, no gui installed
2011-04-25T19:22:00.000Z	tjiggi_fo	jubei-za	what I'm saying is sudo apt-get will work for you
2011-04-25T19:23:00.000Z	tjiggi_fo	jubei-za	sudo apt-get dhcp3-common
2011-04-25T19:23:00.000Z	jubei-za	tjiggi_fo	i tried apt-cache search dhcp3 and all i got was 2 client packages listed
2011-04-25T19:23:00.000Z	jubei-za	tjiggi_fo	ye i got that packaged dhcp3-common is that the same as dhcp3-server?
2011-04-25T19:24:00.000Z	tjiggi_fo	jubei-za	let me see, one sec
2011-04-25T19:24:00.000Z	jubei-za	tjiggi_fo	its not the same it one of the dependencies for dhcp3-server
2011-04-25T19:25:00.000Z	tjiggi_fo	jubei-za	not the same, you'll need to : sudo apt-get install dhcp3-server
2011-04-25T19:26:00.000Z	jubei-za	tjiggi_fo	lol i tried that, it says the package cannot be found in any epository
2011-04-25T19:26:00.000Z	tjiggi_fo	jubei-za	heh
2011-04-25T19:27:00.000Z	jubei-za	tjiggi_fo	which is really strange because from this link (https://help.ubuntu.com/10.10/serverguide/C/dhcp.html) its seems that it should be in there!
2011-04-25T19:27:00.000Z	jubei-za	tjiggi_fo	i know very weird
2011-04-25T19:29:00.000Z	tjiggi_fo	jubei-za	I have it in Lucid-security/Main - your setup sounds lekker daft - maybe try adding repositories from some other mirror?
2011-04-25T19:30:00.000Z	jubei-za	tjiggi_fo	when you say "Lucid-security/Main" are you talking about /etc/sources.list ?
2011-04-25T19:30:00.000Z	tjiggi_fo	jubei-za	yep
2011-04-25T19:31:00.000Z	jubei-za	tjiggi_fo	i have a line there "deb http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu lucid-security main restricted"
2011-04-25T19:37:00.000Z	tjiggi_fo	jubei-za	If I were you I'd try at #ubuntu-za. Those guys will know what to do if yours is a sources problem
2011-04-25T19:37:00.000Z	jubei-za	tjiggi_fo	ok thanks for the help will ask there!
