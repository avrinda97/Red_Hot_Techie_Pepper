2009-06-06T14:57:00.000Z	Llewxam		hey all quick question.
2009-06-06T14:58:00.000Z	Llewxam		i'm seeing in synaptic i got linux-generic linux-headers, restricted modules generic, image generic and headers generic with available upgrade but can't run the upgrade and also update manager no longer showing up on my taskbar. this all after upgrading to jaunty. any idea why and how to fix it? o.0
2009-06-06T14:59:00.000Z	coz_	Llewxam	 I believe the update manager doesnt show up as oftent as it used to
2009-06-06T14:59:00.000Z	Llewxam	coz_	even when there are updates/
2009-06-06T14:59:00.000Z	coz_	Llewxam	 also in synaptic did you hit reload then Apply to see if it will upgrade
2009-06-06T14:59:00.000Z	Llewxam	coz_	i did and it does nothing
2009-06-06T14:59:00.000Z	coz_	Llewxam	  I believe it is about once a week now  but not sure
2009-06-06T14:59:00.000Z	coz_	Llewxam	 ok   close synaptic  open terminal   sudo apt-get update   then   sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
2009-06-06T15:00:00.000Z	coz_	Llewxam	 see if any errors or messages show up
2009-06-06T15:00:00.000Z	Llewxam	coz_	on it
2009-06-06T15:01:00.000Z	Llewxam	coz_	the same packages i mentioned are kept back.
2009-06-06T15:01:00.000Z	coz_	Llewxam	  it says they are kept back?
2009-06-06T15:01:00.000Z	Llewxam	coz_	yep. that's all it says.
2009-06-06T15:02:00.000Z	coz_	Llewxam	 then just wait until  tomorrow perhaps now all pacakges are available or something is up with the repo on their end  I dont know all the possibilities when a pacakge is held back
2009-06-06T15:05:00.000Z	coz_	Llewxam	 if a package is held back with all repos enabled  likely it is not on  your end
2009-06-06T15:05:00.000Z	coz_	Llewxam	  yeah that part is for sure ...it has been changed hold on
