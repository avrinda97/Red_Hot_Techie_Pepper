2009-10-24T20:52:00.000Z	bridget	billy	yeah mine have always shown.
2009-10-24T20:52:00.000Z	billy	bridget	hmm. Mines isn't :(
2009-10-24T20:52:00.000Z	bridget		does it show up in the windows computer where you made it?
2009-10-24T20:53:00.000Z	billy		yeah
2009-10-24T20:53:00.000Z	billy		Bridget: yeah
2009-10-24T20:53:00.000Z	bridget	billy	honestly, i googled something like "create icon thumb drive " (w/o quotes) when i created mine, and i figured out how to get it to w work for mac, windows and linux
2009-10-24T20:54:00.000Z	billy		k
2009-10-24T20:54:00.000Z	billy		Bridget: i think I found the problem. it takes the icon from an EXE. Could that be the issue?
2009-10-24T20:55:00.000Z	bridget		from an exe? ... you mean the image path  is something like "./image_thumb.exe"?
2009-10-24T20:55:00.000Z	billy		yeah
2009-10-24T20:55:00.000Z	billy		Bridget: yeah
2009-10-24T20:56:00.000Z	bridget		yeah.. when i did it I actually had a designated image for the icon
2009-10-24T20:56:00.000Z	billy		Alright
2009-10-24T20:56:00.000Z	billy		I'll have to change it
2009-10-24T20:56:00.000Z	billy		Bridget: But Windows only supports .ico
2009-10-24T20:57:00.000Z	billy		Bridget: And I don't think Ubuntu does
2009-10-24T20:57:00.000Z	bridget	billy	i think it does (otherwise most favicons on the web wouldn't show up in linux browsers). wait so its an ico or an exe? i believe i used ico...
