2009-01-26T19:21:00.000Z	vesa_		hey im newbie. what is the command for run firefox? I need it for xbindkeys
2009-01-26T19:22:00.000Z	erUSUL	vesa_	firefox
2011-04-25T22:56:00.000Z	erUSUL	vesa_	what do you mean by define?
2011-04-25T22:58:00.000Z	erUSUL	vesa_	which is the swap partition is and how to activate it is defined in /etc/fstab if you are asking that
2011-04-25T23:01:00.000Z	vesa_	erUSUL	well i have this in my fstab: UUID=67ba5488-8cad-4278-b50c-e9f1c0e06be8 none            swap    sw              0       0
2011-04-25T23:01:00.000Z	erUSUL	vesa_	yes; what is the problem with it?
2011-04-25T23:01:00.000Z	vesa_	erUSUL	i dont have any swap
2011-04-25T23:02:00.000Z	erUSUL	vesa_	what does "swapon -s" says ?
2011-04-25T23:02:00.000Z	vesa_	erUSUL	empty
2011-04-25T23:02:00.000Z	erUSUL	vesa_	sudo swpaon -a
2011-04-25T23:02:00.000Z	erUSUL	vesa_	sudo swapon -a
2011-04-25T23:03:00.000Z	vesa_	erUSUL	swapon: cannot find the device for UUID=67ba5488-8cad-4278-b50c-e9f1c0e06be8
2011-04-25T23:04:00.000Z	erUSUL	vesa_	well looks like the swap partition is gone or the uuid changed. did you edited your partitions recently ?
2011-04-25T23:05:00.000Z	vesa_	erUSUL	yeah i did. so that is the reason
2011-04-25T23:05:00.000Z	erUSUL	vesa_	run « sudo blkid » and find out the new uuid then update/edit fstab to reflect the changes
2011-04-25T23:05:00.000Z	vesa_	erUSUL	ok :D
2011-04-25T23:10:00.000Z	vesa_	erUSUL	now it works thanks :)
2011-04-25T23:11:00.000Z	erUSUL	vesa_	no problem
2011-04-25T23:18:00.000Z	vesa_	erUSUL	can you help me with that memory problem :)
