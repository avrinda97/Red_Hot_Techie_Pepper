2006-08-15T15:24:00.000Z	Warbo		I have no problem with Cedega, since they HAVE to work in the way they do, and if not then many people would still be using Windows.
2006-08-15T15:24:00.000Z	Phenax	Warbo	If you want a stable interface into Windows, use a processor emulator. If you want to play games choose out of the many native ones UNIX has.
2006-08-15T15:25:00.000Z	Warbo	Phenax	I don't play games. It's just that Transgaming needs a license to legally circumvent copy protection, so therefore they have to pass that cost on
2006-08-15T15:26:00.000Z	Phenax	Warbo	Well, they shouldn't have ripped a FOSS project, I wouldn't care if they didn't.
2006-08-15T15:27:00.000Z	Warbo	Phenax	Either a) They don't use WINE, then there is no point doing it and many people would be without their games, or b) They do, they make their code available, then get shut down by the RIAA or whoever
2006-08-15T15:27:00.000Z	Phenax	Warbo	No, there code was available for a while, and CVS builds should remain available but they don't release them because so many people were just grabbing the CVS
2006-08-15T15:27:00.000Z	Phenax	Warbo	They ripped off WINE, fair and straight.
2006-08-15T15:28:00.000Z	Warbo	Phenax	WINE developers recommend it to users, so I don't think they are too miffed
2006-08-15T15:28:00.000Z	Phenax	Warbo	Well that's their opinion, not mine. Cedega is horrible.
2006-08-15T15:29:00.000Z	Warbo	Phenax	I agree, that's why I don't use it. The end
2006-08-15T15:36:00.000Z	Phenax	Warbo	The newer Skype's use ALSA or OSS, and OSS is quite fine
2006-08-15T15:38:00.000Z	Phenax	Warbo	There is a point on making WINE x86_64, to allow people with an x86_64 OS to use it. Anyways it can be ran fine with emul-* libraries/etc no need for linux32
2006-08-15T15:39:00.000Z	Warbo	Phenax	What I am saying is that compiling Wine for 64bit would be pointless, so just make it available like any other 32bit app on 64bit
2006-08-15T15:40:00.000Z	Phenax	Warbo	That's an Ubuntu-specific problem really. :] 
2006-08-15T15:41:00.000Z	Warbo	Phenax	That's what I meant :)
2006-08-15T15:41:00.000Z	Warbo	Phenax	I assure you that 90% of the problems people have with 64bit Ubuntu is not GIMP
2006-08-15T15:42:00.000Z	Phenax	Warbo	GIMP works fine on x86_64 here?
2006-08-15T15:42:00.000Z	Phenax	Warbo	I don't use, and never have used Ubuntu, but every application I've tried works fine here
2006-08-15T15:42:00.000Z	Warbo	Phenax	I mean the 5% of 32bit-only apps are the cause of 90% of the problems :)
