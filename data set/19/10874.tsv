2007-08-26T07:32:00.000Z	boabsta	Sivik	make sure you use the FULL paths when creating a symlink
2007-08-26T07:34:00.000Z	boabsta	Sivik	ln [OPTION] ... [-T]  TARGET LINK_NAME
2007-08-26T07:34:00.000Z	boabsta	Sivik	make sure you enter the full paths though
2007-08-26T07:40:00.000Z	boabsta	Sivik	rm same as files
2007-08-26T07:41:00.000Z	boabsta	Sivik	just rm <symlink> does the trick?
2007-08-26T07:43:00.000Z	Sivik	boabsta	the problem with that for some reason, its trying to delete the folder rather than the symlink
2007-08-26T07:45:00.000Z	boabsta	Sivik	weird, you've possibly made a hardlink - i just made a quick symlink to a file i dont care about then deleted the symlink using rm and the file that the symlink pointed to still exists
2007-08-26T07:45:00.000Z	boabsta	Sivik	(started to doubt myself lol)
2007-08-26T07:45:00.000Z	Sivik	boabsta	lol
2007-08-26T07:45:00.000Z	Sivik	boabsta	ln -s /home/nex1391/ /var/www/
2007-08-26T07:45:00.000Z	Sivik	boabsta	thats how i made the symlink to being with
2007-08-26T07:46:00.000Z	boabsta	Sivik	nooo, should be ln -s /home/nex1391/ /var/www/nex1391 or something
2007-08-26T07:46:00.000Z	boabsta	Sivik	what does ls -l /var/ say?
2007-08-26T07:47:00.000Z	Sivik	boabsta	http://pastebin.com/m5101d31d
2007-08-26T07:48:00.000Z	boabsta	Sivik	you should be able to do rm /var/www/nex1391 safely - that should remove any files in /home/nex1391
2007-08-26T07:49:00.000Z	boabsta	Sivik	*shouldnt* remove any files
2007-08-26T07:49:00.000Z	Sivik	boabsta	hey, it worked that time
2007-08-26T07:49:00.000Z	boabsta	Sivik	cool :)
