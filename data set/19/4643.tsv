2008-12-15T23:08:00.000Z	Sooke		Hi all
2008-12-15T23:09:00.000Z	Sooke		How can I access to the network drives in a VPN connection thtought Ubuntu?
2008-12-15T23:09:00.000Z	Sooke		(I know their names but no IPs)
2008-12-15T23:10:00.000Z	Sooke		In Win I used to do: //computer_name/share_name, but what about Ubuntu?
2008-12-15T23:12:00.000Z	jimcooncat	Sooke	From the menu, Places -> Connect to Server..., then for Service type: "Windows share" or click the Browse Network button
2008-12-15T23:13:00.000Z	Sooke	jimcooncat	but in windows share there are so many params, I used to to know in windows only computer name, share name and my loing and password
2008-12-15T23:13:00.000Z	jimcooncat	Sooke	click the Browse Network button at bottom of that
2008-12-15T23:14:00.000Z	Sooke	jimcooncat	done, empty
2008-12-15T23:15:00.000Z	Sooke	jimcooncat	the window is empty, no drives there. I can ping all the computers in the VPN network, but somehow I cant resolve their names; ALso the server is a WIn based
2008-12-15T23:17:00.000Z	jimcooncat	Sooke	wish I knew more; I just have a small peer network at the office, and maybe yours uses a directory. If no one else here can help, maybe ask in #samba or #gnome
2008-12-15T23:17:00.000Z	Sooke		I GOT IT XDDDDD
2008-12-15T23:17:00.000Z	Sooke	jimcooncat	I got it
2008-12-15T23:18:00.000Z	jimcooncat	Sooke	how?
2008-12-15T23:19:00.000Z	Sooke	jimcooncat	just  figured out the ip of the server, then I opened a new server connection, "Windows Share", then I put into: Server (the IP), Share(Empty), Folder (the share name I already know), domain (empty), user (my user), and it connected and I have all the remote folders ehre
2008-12-15T23:20:00.000Z	Sooke	jimcooncat	since the names resolve is not possible, the tricky issue here is to find out the IP of the name your network administrator usually gives you
2008-12-15T23:21:00.000Z	jimcooncat	Sooke	thanks, I'm always trying to learn
2008-12-15T23:21:00.000Z	Sooke	jimcooncat	try to do it , I had to ping netbios randomly to all the 2-20 ips jus to find out the server
2008-12-15T23:22:00.000Z	Sooke	jimcooncat	my amdinistrator jus told me the human network name of the server, but not the IP,
2008-12-15T23:24:00.000Z	jimcooncat	Sooke	using Nautilus I typed smb://10.0.0.7 and I see the share on my work machine
