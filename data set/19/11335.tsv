2006-05-03T05:46:00.000Z	mzuverink		amphi:do you know if that mail area is readable through like squirrelmail or any other web based email clients?
2006-05-03T05:47:00.000Z	mzuverink		amphi:I would like to throw in a web based email client to get my mail remotely
2006-05-03T05:47:00.000Z	mzuverink		I think i am biting off too much
2006-05-03T05:48:00.000Z	cafuego	mzuverink	Ane asy start would be to install uw-imapd. That will give you access to mail in /var/mail/ and stuff in ~/mbox or ~/Mail
2006-05-03T05:50:00.000Z	cafuego	mzuverink	squirrelmail always runs fine on `localhost' too ;-)
2006-05-03T05:51:00.000Z	mzuverink	cafuego	using synaptic I selected squirrelmail and none of the dependencies are related to mail at all, php stuff and the like only
2006-05-03T05:51:00.000Z	mzuverink	cafuego	and of course apache2
2006-05-03T05:52:00.000Z	cafuego	mzuverink	Yep
2006-05-03T05:52:00.000Z	cafuego	mzuverink	squirrelmail doesn't *need* a local imap server (you can make it talk to any imap server, anywhere) so it woulnd't install one.
2006-05-03T05:52:00.000Z	mzuverink	cafuego	How hard is it to configure squirrelmail, have you done it before?
2006-05-03T05:53:00.000Z	cafuego	mzuverink	It's *really* easy. It comes with a little perl script that just displays menus (text-based)
2006-05-03T05:54:00.000Z	mzuverink	cafuego	Since I need to get the mail from gmail for all users, fetchmail passes it off to postfix, and then will postfix place it in whatever type of folder/dir i specify?
2006-05-03T05:55:00.000Z	cafuego	mzuverink	By default, postfix delivers it to an mbox format mail file in /var/mail
2006-05-03T05:55:00.000Z	cafuego	mzuverink	If you install uw-imap, it can read those mail stores and interface with squirrelmail.
2006-05-06T10:14:00.000Z	mzuverink	cafuego	Do you have time to help me out with squirrelmail?  I spoke with you the other day regarding this issue.
2007-02-10T07:56:00.000Z	mzuverink	cafuego	ok, thnx
2007-02-10T07:57:00.000Z	mzuverink	cafuego	says not found
2007-02-10T07:59:00.000Z	mzuverink	cafuego	found it in synaptic, thanks
2007-02-16T12:07:00.000Z	mzuverink	cafuego	I am assuming that you are the cat responsible for .debs that bear your name.  I am noticing that you have a gktpod v.0.99.8-0, and that you have no gtkpod-aac v.0.99.8-0.  Does the repo version support aac and you forgot to label as, or does not a beast exist?
