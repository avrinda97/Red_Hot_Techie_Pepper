2009-01-31T04:51:00.000Z	cadman21	Rhorse	would it matter if the people were speaking French in the video? because I still am not getting any sound...
2009-01-31T04:52:00.000Z	Rhorse	cadman21	hmm, I didn't have a problem on this Feisty machine with vlc.
2009-01-31T04:52:00.000Z	Rhorse	cadman21	does your sound work ok otherwise?
