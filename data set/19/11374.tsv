2006-04-07T15:35:00.000Z	bina		how easy is it to move /home/ to anoder hard disk? is it just a case of copying the files accross and then automatically mounting the device on boot?
2006-04-07T15:36:00.000Z	Frogzoo	bina	yep, be careful to preserve permissions though - so use tar, not copy
2006-04-07T15:37:00.000Z	bina	Frogzoo	oh right, thanks.  good thinkg you told me, i would have just used cp :P
2006-04-07T15:39:00.000Z	Frogzoo	bina	symlinks as well - hard links will cause problems regardless, but that's the user's problem (or use cpio)
2006-04-07T15:42:00.000Z	bina	Frogzoo	So I should tar -cpsf /media/hdb/ /home/* ?
2006-04-07T15:44:00.000Z	Frogzoo	bina	this would best be done running single user mode, with /home mounted ro
2006-04-07T15:44:00.000Z	bina	Frogzoo	oh right, how do i get down to single user mode?
2006-04-07T15:45:00.000Z	Frogzoo	bina	reboot & choose recovery mode (which is single user)
2006-04-07T15:48:00.000Z	bina	Frogzoo	oh right, thanks
2006-04-22T12:56:00.000Z	Frogzoo	bina	interested in 3D games? if so, stay clear of ATI until they fix their crap drivers
2006-04-22T12:57:00.000Z	bina	Frogzoo	I dont play games much, i just do coding mainly on here
2006-04-22T12:57:00.000Z	bina	Frogzoo	Tux racer and screensavers is about it :)
2006-04-25T06:38:00.000Z	Frogzoo	bina	do you have an ATI card?
2006-04-25T06:38:00.000Z	bina	Frogzoo	yeah, Radeon 9550
2006-04-25T06:39:00.000Z	bina	Frogzoo	the other card was an old matrox mystique in PCI (radeon was in AGP).  There was power to the Radeon but nothing on the screen, so i took the mystique out and tried again and the radeon worked
2006-04-25T06:40:00.000Z	Frogzoo	bina	install fglrx-control   & then try using fireglcontrolpanel
2006-04-25T06:40:00.000Z	bina	Frogzoo	sweet I'll try that. Thanks
2006-04-25T06:40:00.000Z	bina	Frogzoo	Do you know whether I can use a DVI to VGA converter for use on a TFT screen, or does that only work with LCD
2006-05-27T10:57:00.000Z	Frogzoo	bina	nope - you need to run a dns cache
