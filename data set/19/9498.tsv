2006-10-30T12:58:00.000Z	VividHazE		This CP command is driving me nuts! can anyone help, I've got a folder called Clearlooks in my home directory and I want to copy the whole folder to my /usr/share/amsn/skins folder, what do I type! the man and info pages were way too complicated :S
2006-10-30T12:59:00.000Z	MarcN	VividHazE	cp -r /from /to
2006-10-30T12:59:00.000Z	VividHazE	MarcN	do I have to be in the folder with the Clearlooks folder for it to work?
2006-10-30T13:00:00.000Z	VividHazE	MarcN	where do I specify the name of the folder.
2006-10-30T13:00:00.000Z	MarcN	VividHazE	not if you give the full pathnames
2006-10-30T13:00:00.000Z	VividHazE	MarcN	ok will give it as hot
2006-10-30T13:00:00.000Z	VividHazE		* a hot

2006-10-30T13:02:00.000Z	MarcN	VividHazE	30 year old programs do that you know.
2006-10-30T13:02:00.000Z	VividHazE	MarcN	Not even a message to say its done :)

2006-10-30T13:02:00.000Z	VividHazE	MarcN	I'm going to have to use Linux for about 30 years before I get the hang of it.
2006-10-30T13:02:00.000Z	VividHazE		My hatred of windoze is keeping me at it though.
2006-10-30T13:03:00.000Z	MarcN	VividHazE	I've only used it for ~20 years ;-)
2006-10-30T13:03:00.000Z	VividHazE	MarcN	Ha, roughly as long as I've been alive!
