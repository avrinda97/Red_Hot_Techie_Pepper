2009-02-21T05:34:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ScottG489	yes best to turn  Compiz off for 3D games,  also I expect Google Earth as well
2009-02-21T05:35:00.000Z	ScottG489	sebsebseb	yea for a few things like that I turn off compiz. It wouldnt be a big deal at all really but all of my windows reset to worspace 1
2009-02-21T05:36:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ScottG489	you can run that  with Wine, but I really can't see why you would want to,  with the amazing Banshee   Intrepid Ibex version :)  it's got a rubbish version in Hardy, but a ppa can be added for later version
2009-02-21T05:37:00.000Z	ScottG489	sebsebseb	lol wo hold up I didnt understand a lot of  that. I can run what with Wine? and whats Banshee?
2009-02-21T05:38:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ScottG489	 you got Intrepid Ibex?
2009-02-21T05:38:00.000Z	ScottG489	sebsebseb	uuuh, i have 8.10
2009-02-21T05:38:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ScottG489	ok good
2009-02-21T05:38:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ScottG489	open the terminal and
2009-02-21T05:38:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ScottG489	sudo apt-get install banshee
2009-02-21T05:39:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ScottG489	then under sound and video, you will have a very good music and video player
2009-02-21T05:39:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ScottG489	VLC is also nice for video
2009-02-21T05:40:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ScottG489	XMMS is not that good,  Banshee is very good :)
2009-02-21T05:40:00.000Z	ScottG489	sebsebseb	Ill find out for myself
2009-02-21T05:41:00.000Z	ScottG489	sebsebseb	I think conky has an addon for xmms so thats a plus already :)
2009-02-21T05:45:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ScottG489	I tried that out ages ago I think, that's probably ok yeah
2009-02-21T05:45:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ScottG489	,but  in that case,  for whatever reason I woudn't have thought it was good since I went back to Rythombox
2009-02-21T05:45:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ScottG489	maybe it lacked last.fm suppourt or somethign
2009-02-21T05:46:00.000Z	ScottG489	sebsebseb	Well I have 3 to try out right now so ill moderatly pace myself lol
2009-02-21T05:46:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ScottG489	Mplayer  that can be useful for something as well
