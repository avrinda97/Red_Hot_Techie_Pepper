2005-10-20T12:24:00.000Z	nickrud	ian	cat /etc/issue
2005-10-20T12:25:00.000Z	ian	nickrud	Not sure what you mean...
2005-10-20T12:26:00.000Z	nickrud	ian	in a terminal, type `cat /etc/issue`, it will tell you which version you are running
2005-10-20T12:26:00.000Z	ian	nickrud	Thanks
2005-10-20T12:26:00.000Z	nickrud	ian	np, you just reminded me to be a bit less terse :)
2005-10-20T12:29:00.000Z	ian	nickrud	in the spirit of being less terse, any chance you can lend a hand with installing Brezzy on a Win98 lappy that doesn not have any CD-ROM or floppy drive....? :)
2005-10-20T12:30:00.000Z	nickrud	ian	yeah, pull the drive, put it in another machine, and install there :)
2005-10-20T12:30:00.000Z	ian	nickrud	Would that work?
2005-10-20T12:30:00.000Z	nickrud	ian	sometimes
2005-10-20T12:31:00.000Z	ian	nickrud	Any experience with GRUB4DOS?
2005-10-20T12:31:00.000Z	nickrud	ian	not a bit
2005-10-20T12:31:00.000Z	ian	nickrud	ok thanks anyway
2005-10-20T12:32:00.000Z	nickrud	ian	do you have a linux install on the laptop?
2005-10-20T12:33:00.000Z	ian	nickrud	No Win98
2005-10-20T12:36:00.000Z	nickrud	ian	you might want to look at http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=68009, it may work for you. debootstrap is the way to go, though.
2005-10-20T12:36:00.000Z	ian	nickrud	Will give it a try, thanks.
2005-10-20T12:38:00.000Z	ian	nickrud	Not sure how I can use debootstrap and the live CD given I dont a CD drive.
2005-10-20T12:39:00.000Z	nickrud	ian	I was hoping you would not call me on that bit of idiocy
