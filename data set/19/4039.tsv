2009-10-04T03:39:00.000Z	wlodi	dro	what's the ifconfig mess saying?
2009-10-04T03:41:00.000Z	dro	wlodi	everything looks normal, no ip listed while in dhcp, but ip is there with static
2009-10-04T03:42:00.000Z	dro	wlodi	everything works great from wlan0, but eth0 can't even ping gateway until i type "sudo ifconfig eth0 default gw 192.168.15.1" then can only ping things in the 192.168.15.0/24 subnet
2009-10-04T03:44:00.000Z	wlodi	dro	what's in the /etc/network/interfaces file?
2009-10-04T03:44:00.000Z	dro	wlodi	well when running dhcp just, auth eth0 iface eth0 inet dhcp
2009-10-04T03:44:00.000Z	dro	wlodi	remember, everything worked until i ran dist-upgrade
2009-10-04T03:45:00.000Z	dro	wlodi	i normally use gnome network manager, I even tried wicd, and even tried manually setting dhcp/static in /etc/network/interfaces
2009-10-04T03:47:00.000Z	dro		I believe I have a routing issue, can't ping anything in the network or outside network until i type "sudo ifconfig eth0 default gw 192.168.15.1" and then can only ping things in the network 192.168.15.0/24 but nothing other than that
2009-10-04T03:48:00.000Z	wlodi	dro	have you tried clearing the routing cache?
2009-10-04T03:48:00.000Z	dro	wlodi	how do I do that?
2009-10-04T03:50:00.000Z	dro	wlodi	"sudo ip route flush cache" ?
2009-10-04T03:50:00.000Z	wlodi	dro	crap, I don't remember at the moment:)
2009-10-04T03:51:00.000Z	wlodi	dro	have you checked the /etc/dhcp3/dhclient.conf?
2009-10-04T03:52:00.000Z	dro	wlodi	no, because static didn't work either
2009-10-04T03:53:00.000Z	wlodi	dro	do you normally use the network manager?
2009-10-04T03:55:00.000Z	dro	wlodi	yes, but right now it's uninstalled and i'm using wicd
2009-10-04T04:07:00.000Z	wlodi	dro	maybe try to add an entry to /etc/network/interfaces
2009-10-04T04:07:00.000Z	wlodi	dro	auto eth0
2009-10-04T04:08:00.000Z	wlodi	dro	and next line: iface eth0 inet dhcp
