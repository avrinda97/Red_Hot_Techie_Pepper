2008-06-20T21:37:00.000Z	coldboot		Does anyone have a /etc/bash_completion that isn't broken?
2008-06-20T21:37:00.000Z	coldboot		sh -x /etc/bash_completion to see if yours doesn't give an error
2008-06-20T21:38:00.000Z	EvilDennisR	coldboot	Dude, you don't sh bashcompletion you include it
2008-06-20T21:38:00.000Z	EvilDennisR		if [ -f /etc/bash_completion ]; then
2008-06-20T21:38:00.000Z	EvilDennisR		    . /etc/bash_completion
2008-06-20T21:38:00.000Z	EvilDennisR		fi
2008-06-20T21:39:00.000Z	coldboot	EvilDennisR	When my ~/.profile includes /etc/bash_completion, it never finishes running, because /etc/bash_completion is broken in 8.04
2008-06-20T21:39:00.000Z	EvilDennisR	coldboot	Are these stock files, or did you change them
2008-06-20T21:39:00.000Z	coldboot	EvilDennisR	Stock
2008-06-20T21:39:00.000Z	EvilDennisR	coldboot	show me
2008-06-20T21:39:00.000Z	EvilDennisR		!pastebin | coldboot
2008-06-20T21:40:00.000Z	EvilDennisR	coldboot	~/.bashrc ~/.bash_profile /etc/bash.bashrc
2008-06-20T21:40:00.000Z	EvilDennisR	coldboot	pastebin those files for me
2008-06-20T21:40:00.000Z	coldboot		In ~/.profile
2008-06-20T21:40:00.000Z	coldboot		Wait
2008-06-20T21:40:00.000Z	EvilDennisR	coldboot	.profile as well
2008-06-20T21:41:00.000Z	coldboot		I mean ~/.profile includes ~/.bashrc, and ~/.bashrc includes /etc/bash_completion, and after including bash completion, I have "echo 'done'" which never gets executed
2008-06-20T21:41:00.000Z	EvilDennisR	coldboot	Pastebin the files
2008-06-20T21:41:00.000Z	EvilDennisR	coldboot	Then we can look at them, and tell you whats wrong
