2009-01-29T12:43:00.000Z	phix		dpkg: error processing sun-j2sdk1.4_1.4.2+18_i386.deb (--install): package architecture (i386) does not match system (amd64)
2009-01-29T12:44:00.000Z	codeyman	phix	You are using a 32bit deb on a 64 bit system
2009-01-29T12:44:00.000Z	phix	codeyman	so?
2009-01-29T12:45:00.000Z	codeyman	phix	doesnt work
2009-01-29T12:45:00.000Z	phix	codeyman	why not?
2009-01-29T12:45:00.000Z	phix	codeyman	so how can I make it work?
2009-01-29T12:46:00.000Z	codeyman	phix	get the 64 bit binaries
2009-01-29T12:46:00.000Z	phix	codeyman	but I have a 64bit CPU which supports 32bit binaries
2009-01-29T12:47:00.000Z	phix	codeyman	I cant make the 64bit binaries because make-jpkg fails
2009-01-29T12:47:00.000Z	codeyman	phix	what are you trying to do
2009-01-29T12:48:00.000Z	phix	codeyman	I am trying to build a deb package from java's JDK version 1.4 bins
2009-01-29T12:48:00.000Z	phix	codeyman	I want to have a JDK 1.4 installation as well as a JDK 1.6
2009-01-29T12:49:00.000Z	codeyman	phix	unless I'm mistaken.. you need 64bit version of files
2009-01-29T12:49:00.000Z	phix	codeyman	so I can't tell dpkg to force install?
2009-01-29T12:49:00.000Z	codeyman	phix	no
2009-01-29T12:49:00.000Z	phix	codeyman	why? ubuntu has 32bit libraries too
2009-01-29T12:49:00.000Z	codeyman	phix	ubuntu has different repos for 64bit and 32bit
2009-01-29T12:51:00.000Z	phix	codeyman	ok so how do I mangle a 32bit package to to be a 64bit package?
2009-01-29T12:51:00.000Z	codeyman	phix	I have no idea.. if pkg is difficult to find.. I would just compile from sources..
