2011-05-17T08:44:00.000Z	angheloko		connecting to wifi via terminal is just mind-blowing, ugh
2011-05-17T08:44:00.000Z	angheloko		i give up
2011-05-17T08:44:00.000Z	sroy2	angheloko	dhclient doesn't do the job?
2011-05-17T08:44:00.000Z	angheloko	sroy2	i couldnt even get to that part.. im stuck with wpa_supplicant
2011-05-17T08:45:00.000Z	sroy2	angheloko	mmm I'm assuming you have the drivers installed for the card?
2011-05-17T08:47:00.000Z	angheloko	sroy2	i just keep on getting a couldn't associate error
2011-05-17T08:47:00.000Z	sroy2	angheloko	are the ... what are they ... ?brodcom-sda? drivers installed
2011-05-17T08:48:00.000Z	angheloko	sroy2	hmm.. that i am not sure of.. anyway i'm planning on getting a UI with aptoncd, perhaps fluxbox, just so i can config via GUI
2011-05-17T08:49:00.000Z	sroy2	angheloko	I had to install the bcmwl-kernal-source, broadcom-sta-common, and b43-fwcutter packages before I got my broadcom wireless card to work
2011-05-17T08:50:00.000Z	angheloko	sroy2	then you connected via wpa_supplicant?
2011-05-17T08:50:00.000Z	angheloko	sroy2	perhaps im missing the drivers then
2011-05-17T08:51:00.000Z	sroy2	angheloko	I was using a wpa2 network :S
2011-05-17T08:51:00.000Z	angheloko	sroy2	i am also using wpa2? what did u do next to connect? wicd-cli?
2011-05-17T08:52:00.000Z	sroy2	angheloko	I was using a gui so it did pretty much everything for me but I'll back out to the command line to figure it out
2011-05-17T08:56:00.000Z	angheloko	sroy2	yeah.. i;m planning on getting a gui.. i just thought i could do it via term.. my linux skills is weak
2011-05-17T08:56:00.000Z	sroy2	angheloko	nah its always good to do it from the command line
2011-05-17T08:57:00.000Z	sroy2	angheloko	I would try something like sudo iwconfig eth1 essid "networkid" key "password"
2011-05-17T08:58:00.000Z	angheloko	sroy2	i rem doing that alr... i'll try again
2011-05-17T09:09:00.000Z	angheloko	sroy2	the password is the plain password yes?
