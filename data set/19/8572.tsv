2007-03-11T13:01:00.000Z	mike1o	Phatrabbit	did you install the driver from nvidia.com?
2007-03-11T13:01:00.000Z	mike1o	Phatrabbit	I think I might have had the same problem
2007-03-11T13:02:00.000Z	Phatrabbit	mike1o	yer its fustrating
2007-03-11T13:02:00.000Z	mike1o	Phatrabbit	do u have ubuntu nvidia installed?
2007-03-11T13:03:00.000Z	mike1o	Phatrabbit	i meant nvidia drivers
2007-03-11T13:03:00.000Z	mike1o	Phatrabbit	I meant native ubuntu drivers
2007-03-11T13:04:00.000Z	mike1o	Phatrabbit	i resolved by removing the native nv drivers
2007-03-11T13:04:00.000Z	mike1o	Phatrabbit	did you recently update your kernel?
2007-03-11T13:07:00.000Z	mike1o	Phatrabbit	did u upgrade your kernel recently?
2007-03-11T13:09:00.000Z	Phatrabbit	mike1o	yes i have
2007-03-11T13:10:00.000Z	mike1o	Phatrabbit	original nvidia drivers need to be compiled with the current kernel headers and conflict with ubuntu nv drivers
2007-03-11T13:10:00.000Z	mike1o	Phatrabbit	have u tried reinstalling nvidia.com's drivers?
2007-03-11T13:12:00.000Z	mike1o	Phatrabbit	sudo apt-get remove nvdia* ... that was causing me problems
2007-03-11T13:13:00.000Z	mike1o	Phatrabbit	just use nvidia.com's drivers
