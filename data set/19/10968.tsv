2006-06-04T13:49:00.000Z	method|		anyway, is kubuntu just as good as ubuntu in the dapper release? I tried the ubuntu live cd and EVERYTHING worked out of the box. Wireless, video card, etc. I was impressed. I am a kde user however. Will I experience the same thing when I boot up the kubuntu live cd?
