2005-05-18T14:12:00.000Z	t35t0r		I've got the following wireless device: ndiswrapper version 1.1 loaded (preempt=yes,smp=no) | ndiswrapper: driver bcmwl5 (Broadcom,10/20/2004, 3.70.22.0) loaded ..and i'm trying to use wpa_supplicant to connect to my router, but whenever I try to connect manually I get this error: /root# wpa_supplicant -dd -iwlan0 -c/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf -Dndiswrapper | Failed to initialize EAPOL state machines. ..this same driver in winxp works with wpa-psk ..any ideas
2005-05-18T14:12:00.000Z	t35t0r		 what's wrong?
2005-05-18T14:13:00.000Z	TMM	t35t0r	short answer: ndiswrapper isn't perfect, long answer, google :) ndiswrapper is VERY unsported by most people, and most people want to stay the hell away from it. I only use it on one machine myself, because the wifi is integrated in the laptop, and I'm thinking about just putting in a supported chip.
2005-05-18T14:13:00.000Z	t35t0r	TMM	google was no help
2005-05-18T14:14:00.000Z	t35t0r	TMM	ndiswrapper works fine with WEP
2005-05-18T14:14:00.000Z	TMM	t35t0r	ndiswrapper is only for the really desperate... if you can, buy another wifi card, with proper NATIVE support.
2005-05-18T14:14:00.000Z	t35t0r	TMM	pfff
2005-05-18T14:14:00.000Z	TMM	t35t0r	just trying to help, sorry.
2005-05-18T14:16:00.000Z	TMM	t35t0r	the fact that a driver works with something in winxp, doesn't mean that ndiswrapper implements all that behaviour from windows. Ndiswrapper is basically a reimplementation of part of the windows NT kernel, and a bunch of userland stuff... it's not just a 'loader for windows drivers' it does a lot.
2005-05-18T14:18:00.000Z	t35t0r	TMM	http://sial.org/pbot/10058 my wpa_supplicant.conf
2005-05-18T14:19:00.000Z	TMM	t35t0r	looking at it...
2005-05-18T14:22:00.000Z	TMM	t35t0r	you got all the hostap stuff installed?
2005-05-18T14:23:00.000Z	t35t0r	TMM	i had hostap-utils installed but its only for prism
2005-05-18T14:23:00.000Z	t35t0r	TMM	when i tried hostap-diag wlan0 it said it couldn't find prism chipset
2005-05-18T14:24:00.000Z	TMM	t35t0r	what version of wpa_supplicant are you running?
2005-05-18T14:25:00.000Z	t35t0r	TMM	0.4.0
2005-05-18T14:27:00.000Z	TMM	t35t0r	sorry, you got me then... I dont think it's related to ndiswrapper afterall... it looks like ndiswrapper should be supported just fine by wpa_supplicant...
2005-05-18T14:28:00.000Z	TMM	t35t0r	I'd try the mailing list if I where you
2005-05-18T14:58:00.000Z	t35t0r	TMM	ok so i got it to work with wpa_supplicant 0.3.8 there was something wrong with the 0.4.0 version, but now my question is ..is there anyway to specify the channel and frequency using wpa_supplicant so i can use an access point that has broadcast turned off (I was able to do this with iwconfig)
