2010-09-02T22:15:00.000Z	m11kkaa	Besogon	i alreader tried 2.6.35-kernel but it doesn't help
2010-09-02T22:18:00.000Z	m11kkaa	Besogon	I think my problem is a bit different, because in the bucktracker they wrote about the  output of "cat /proc/acpi/battery/BAT1/state" which is "charging state: discharging" for them. But for me this gives "present: no"-message
2010-09-02T22:20:00.000Z	m11kkaa	Besogon	They are talking about an kernel-patch which seems to work for them maybe I should try it out
2010-09-02T22:30:00.000Z	m11kkaa	Besogon	Thank you for your help so far, I will try the patch at this weekend and hopefully it will work
2010-09-02T22:32:00.000Z	Besogon	m11kkaa	I couldn't do much
