2010-05-17T08:10:00.000Z	NewWorld	vicsar	 Maybe you using IPv6? Before I disabled that my internet was ultra slow
2010-05-17T08:11:00.000Z	vicsar	NewWorld	i will double check but i don't think so
2010-05-17T08:12:00.000Z	vicsar	NewWorld	not it is ignored
2010-05-17T08:12:00.000Z	NewWorld	vicsar	 Was it faster before?
2010-05-17T08:12:00.000Z	vicsar	NewWorld	yes, 800+ up 250+ down
2010-05-17T08:13:00.000Z	vicsar	NewWorld	i just cant understand what changed
2010-05-17T08:14:00.000Z	NewWorld	vicsar	 What did you do recently to do with system settings? Or with the router/network-interface?
2010-05-17T08:14:00.000Z	NewWorld	vicsar	 Have you tried another operating system on the same connection?
2010-05-17T08:14:00.000Z	vicsar	NewWorld	that is the weird part, i did not change anything. No one else is using my bandwith it is wired.
2010-05-17T08:15:00.000Z	NewWorld	vicsar	 Have you tried any other OS on this network?
2010-05-17T08:15:00.000Z	vicsar	NewWorld	nope, i only use linux
2010-05-17T08:16:00.000Z	vicsar	NewWorld	but i have used other browsers, i use Firefox primarily
2010-05-17T08:16:00.000Z	NewWorld	vicsar	 You could try booting to a livecd of a linux distro... or a windows Live CD (they exist) and seeing if it's an issue with your primary OS or the network.
2010-05-17T08:16:00.000Z	NewWorld	vicsar	 Did you try measuring your speed quantifiably, like with speedtest.net?
2010-05-17T08:18:00.000Z	NewWorld	vicsar	 I had that and it was because IPV6 was enabled. Try disabling it in Firefox via about:config
