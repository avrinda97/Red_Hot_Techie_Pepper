2006-02-27T12:07:00.000Z	epp		hey what can i do to speed up gnome? i only have 64mb ram...
2006-02-27T12:07:00.000Z	wastrel	epp	 you just answered your own question
2006-02-28T09:50:00.000Z	epp	wastrel	are you serious?
2006-02-28T09:51:00.000Z	epp	wastrel	its like kunbuntu, but xfce4. Its supposed to be great for slow systems.
2006-02-28T10:56:00.000Z	epp	wastrel	good advice.
2006-02-28T10:58:00.000Z	epp	wastrel	can i jsut "sudo apt-get install fluxbox"?
2006-02-28T11:00:00.000Z	wastrel	epp	that should install it, not sure what's needed to change it to the default wm in your display manager
2006-02-28T11:00:00.000Z	wastrel	epp	 actually you should turn off the display manager and just startx after you login.
2006-02-28T11:04:00.000Z	epp	wastrel	WOW! fluxbox is suuuper fast...
2006-02-28T11:32:00.000Z	wastrel	epp	 the thing with fluxbox is, it's not a desktop environment, it's just a window manager.
2006-02-28T11:33:00.000Z	epp	wastrel	pros and cons?
2006-02-28T11:33:00.000Z	wastrel	epp	 so you don't have all the functionality... but you don't have all the bloat either.
2006-02-28T11:33:00.000Z	epp	wastrel	this is true.
2006-02-28T11:33:00.000Z	wastrel	epp	 you can work just fine with just a WM, i did for years.  but you need to learn your way around, and figure out how to do things that are easy with a full on desktop environment.
2006-02-28T11:34:00.000Z	epp	wastrel	yeah. I wish i could have a thing to show my wifi strength.
2006-02-28T11:36:00.000Z	wastrel	epp	 yes, fluxbox supports "windomaker dock apps"  wmwave is one
2006-02-28T11:36:00.000Z	epp	wastrel	hmmm. this is why i love ubuntu. Everyone helps.
2006-02-28T11:36:00.000Z	wastrel	epp	 i love me some wm applets.
2006-02-28T11:38:00.000Z	wastrel	epp	google for dock app warehouse
