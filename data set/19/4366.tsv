2009-01-29T06:33:00.000Z	syzygy		yeah, but I have debian on my workign comp...so I need to find the ubuntu-desktop binaries on my own...
2009-01-29T06:34:00.000Z	syzygy		http://mirror.hampshire.edu/ubuntu/dists/hardy
2009-01-29T06:34:00.000Z	syzygy		are they in here somewher?
2009-01-29T06:35:00.000Z	tritium	syzygy	you don't want to mix ubuntu and debian packages
2009-01-29T06:35:00.000Z	syzygy	tritium	I am aware of that, which is why i did not use synaptic, but the link is to ubuntu not debian
2009-01-29T06:35:00.000Z	tritium	syzygy	because this is a channel for ubuntu support
2009-01-29T06:36:00.000Z	syzygy	tritium	what?
2009-01-29T06:36:00.000Z	tritium	syzygy	hence the channel name, #ubuntu
2009-01-29T06:36:00.000Z	syzygy	tritium	I am trying to fix ubuntu, with ubuntu packages?
2009-01-29T06:36:00.000Z	syzygy	tritium	hence my presence here, and link to ubuntu packages
2009-01-29T06:37:00.000Z	syzygy		what I need to know is how to find ubuntu-desktop packages
2009-01-29T06:37:00.000Z	tritium	syzygy	you said you have debian on your machine
2009-01-29T06:37:00.000Z	syzygy	tritium	yeah, the one that actually loads
2009-01-29T06:37:00.000Z	syzygy	tritium	that is how I am talking to you now
2009-01-29T06:38:00.000Z	syzygy	tritium	otherwise I would be screwed because I cannot get a gui to load in ubuntu, or conenct to internet, hence the entire "load ubuntu-desktop" on usb to load manually
2009-01-29T06:38:00.000Z	syzygy	tritium	but I still need to find packages
2009-01-29T06:38:00.000Z	syzygy		to load onto usb
2009-01-29T06:39:00.000Z	tritium	syzygy	ubuntu-desktop is a meta-package that depends on hundreds of other packages
2009-01-29T06:39:00.000Z	syzygy	tritium	that sucks, but it will still fit on a usb,...
