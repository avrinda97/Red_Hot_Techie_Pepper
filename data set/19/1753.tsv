2011-01-22T22:25:00.000Z	KM0201	new	i'm pretty sure that is your wired controller, not yoru wireless... is there another one there?

2011-01-22T23:18:00.000Z	KM0201	new	to my knowledge, that device will not work w/ the normal STA or b43 driver

2011-09-24T22:30:00.000Z	KM0201	new	there's a command you can run in terminal to find out, thus why i told you to open a terminal
2011-09-24T22:31:00.000Z	KM0201	new	oh ok.
2011-09-24T22:31:00.000Z	KM0201	new	did it look ok on the live cd?
2011-09-24T22:35:00.000Z	KM0201	new	so did that make the screen "visible" on the live cd?
2011-09-24T22:36:00.000Z	KM0201	new	ok, so you just need to add nomode to the install
2011-09-24T22:40:00.000Z	KM0201	new	when you hit e    did you see the option where you could type?
2011-09-24T22:41:00.000Z	KM0201	new	just type nomodeset   at the end
2011-09-24T22:46:00.000Z	KM0201	new	i would consider the fact you can't run unity, a blessing.. :)
2011-09-24T22:46:00.000Z	KM0201	new	you migh also need to install your graphics drivers.
2011-09-24T22:47:00.000Z	KM0201	new	look in system/admin/additional drivers
