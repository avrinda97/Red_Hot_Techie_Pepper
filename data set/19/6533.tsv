2011-08-17T06:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Guest7785	is the system a laptop?
2011-08-17T06:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Guest7785	get a wired connection and get fully updated
2011-08-17T06:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Guest7785	let updates finish and reboot, then use the driver app and install the drivers you need
2011-08-17T06:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Guest7785	you need video drivers probably installing depends on the video chip used.
2011-08-17T06:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Guest7785	then yes you'll need the ati driver, you will be using the open source driver currently
2011-08-17T07:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Guest7785	its a binary, you mark it as executable and run it
2011-08-17T07:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Guest7785	magic huh
