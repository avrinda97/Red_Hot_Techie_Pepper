2011-03-07T13:09:00.000Z	nishant		is it possible to open Webmails in IE like interface ?
2011-03-07T13:10:00.000Z	nishant		i mean IE opens my mails using the web email client , what is the option i have for this in Linux
2011-03-07T13:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nishant	any web browser can use webmail
2011-03-07T13:12:00.000Z	nishant	ActionParsnip	I can open webmail but it does give some advanced option like IE does . I suppose thats because the exchange server used is MS by my company
2011-03-07T13:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nishant	if its in some way optomized for IE then you are out of luck.
2011-03-08T13:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nishant	at login screen press CTRL+ALT+T
2011-03-08T13:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nishant	sorry, F1 not T
2011-03-08T13:43:00.000Z	nishant	ActionParsnip	what about telinit 3 ?
2011-03-08T13:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nishant	CTRL+ALT+F7
2011-03-09T12:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nishant	probably some weird hardware. If you run: lsusb  you should see the 8 character hex id and can then find guides maybe
2011-03-16T14:37:00.000Z	nishant	ActionParsnip	the hdd doesnt get mounted by default ?
2011-03-16T14:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nishant	you can't mount drives
2011-03-16T14:39:00.000Z	nishant	ActionParsnip	you cant mount drives in a LiveVD session ?
2011-03-16T14:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nishant	the partitions in the drive don't get mounted automatically when you boot livecd. The swap space may be in use though
2011-03-16T14:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nishant	you can't mount drives ever, you mount partitions
2011-03-16T14:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nishant	even if a drive has 1 partition taking 100% of the space, you stil mount the partition
2011-03-16T14:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nishant	theres a difference
2011-03-16T14:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nishant	yes the places menu will list the partitions accessible
2011-03-16T14:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nishant	windows incorrectly calls them drives, and newcomers to the OS call stuff drives incorrectly, due to C drive and other such stuff
