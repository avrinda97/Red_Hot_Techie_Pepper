2006-04-06T13:57:00.000Z	Tedd		Can someone help me get all 4 speakers running on ubuntu? I'm running a dell dimension desktop with an Intel IHC5 card.
2006-04-06T13:57:00.000Z	Tedd		Only two work as of right now.
2006-04-06T13:58:00.000Z	Tedd		I've asked this question before, all I get is 'play with Alsa'. I've played with alsa until the cows come home, to no avail...
2006-04-06T13:58:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	Tedd	right click on the volume control in the panel, select 'open volume control', go to teh 'switches' tab, and click 'duplicate front'
2006-04-06T13:59:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	Tedd	If the tab/the option isn't there, go to edit/preferences and add it.
2006-04-06T13:59:00.000Z	Tedd	PuMpErNiCkLe	all I see is "headphone jack sensetive"
2006-04-06T13:59:00.000Z	Tedd		Ok.
2006-04-06T14:00:00.000Z	Tedd	PuMpErNiCkLe	it's not in preferences.
2006-04-06T14:00:00.000Z	Tedd		What about "Exchange Front/Surround"
2006-04-06T14:00:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	Tedd	That could be it.
2006-04-06T14:00:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	Tedd	There's also a 'channel mode' option that lets you select the number of channels.
2006-04-06T14:01:00.000Z	Tedd	PuMpErNiCkLe	I don't know what that means, sorry.
2006-04-06T14:01:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	Tedd	number of channels as in stereo, 2.1, 5.1, and so on
2006-04-06T14:01:00.000Z	Tedd	PuMpErNiCkLe	all there is is 2, 4, and 6
2006-04-06T14:02:00.000Z	Tedd		I'm guessing I'm four.
2006-04-06T14:02:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	Tedd	I'm guessing you are. :)
2006-04-06T14:02:00.000Z	Tedd	PuMpErNiCkLe	lemme restart.\
2006-04-06T14:05:00.000Z	Tedd	PuMpErNiCkLe	no sound at all now
2006-04-06T14:06:00.000Z	Tedd	PuMpErNiCkLe	now I uncheck exchange front and surround and I get sound, but only out of the two speakers
