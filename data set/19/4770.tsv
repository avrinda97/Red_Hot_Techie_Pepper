2009-10-13T21:04:00.000Z	gotunandan	ioka	run $ sudo lshw  -C network , and check your network devices listed
2009-10-13T21:42:00.000Z	gotunandan	ioka	what is the problem you are facing currently ?
2009-10-13T21:43:00.000Z	gotunandan	ioka	what does network-manager tell you ? unmanaged,  regarding wireless network ?
2009-10-13T21:44:00.000Z	gotunandan	ioka	does $ ifconfig list your wireless device ?
2009-10-13T22:14:00.000Z	gotunandan	ioka	there isnt any root password, just you sudo it should work ?
2009-10-13T22:18:00.000Z	gotunandan	ioka	please check if wlan0 is the name of your wireless device, it might be wlan1 or eth1 ?
2009-10-13T22:19:00.000Z	gotunandan	ioka	run $ ifconfig -a
2009-10-13T22:23:00.000Z	gotunandan	ioka	do you have a broadcom wireless card, if so you might have to install the non-free drivers for it
2009-10-13T22:25:00.000Z	gotunandan	ioka	maybe you could get better results with the broadcom STA drivers ? not recommending you to install proprietary drivers but if you dont have a choice
2009-10-13T22:28:00.000Z	gotunandan	ioka	I recommend the 9.10 release actually
2009-10-13T22:50:00.000Z	gotunandan	ioka	elaborate ?
