2011-03-28T08:44:00.000Z	parapara		hello
2011-03-28T08:45:00.000Z	parapara		can I just ask a question, or is there a polite way to wait in line? :-)
2011-03-28T08:45:00.000Z	parapara		thanks guys
2011-03-28T08:46:00.000Z	parapara		I'm having kind of weird issue -> when I try to open synaptic, it asks for a password, and when I enter my password it says the password is invalid
2011-03-28T08:46:00.000Z	parapara		however, I can open synaptic from the terminal with sudo synaptic
2011-03-28T08:46:00.000Z	Peddy	parapara	could you try "gksu synaptic" in terminal?
2011-03-28T08:47:00.000Z	Peddy	parapara	I disconnected there - say again please?
2011-03-28T08:48:00.000Z	Peddy	parapara	an easy solution would be this: right-click on "system", press edit, navigate to System>Administration, click on synaptic, properties, and then change gksu to gksudo
2011-03-28T08:49:00.000Z	Peddy	parapara	to clarify, right-click on menu bar>edit menus
2011-03-28T08:50:00.000Z	Peddy	parapara	try "su username"
2011-03-28T08:51:00.000Z	parapara	Peddy	what should that do?
2011-03-28T08:51:00.000Z	parapara	Peddy	it just brought me back to the same shell prompt
2011-03-28T08:51:00.000Z	Peddy	parapara	that was just to show you the proper use of "su"
2011-03-28T08:52:00.000Z	parapara	Peddy	oh I got you
2011-03-28T08:52:00.000Z	Peddy	parapara	for a quick and dirty fix,  you could try the "editing menus" thing I said earlier
2011-03-28T08:52:00.000Z	parapara	Peddy	I just did it, and it works!
2011-03-28T08:52:00.000Z	parapara	Peddy	thank you
2011-03-28T08:53:00.000Z	Peddy	parapara	that's great. You're welcome! Remember, it's only a temporary fix, and similar problems may happen with other programs
2011-03-28T08:53:00.000Z	parapara	Peddy	got you
