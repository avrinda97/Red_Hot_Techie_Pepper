2006-02-19T15:35:00.000Z	Cylindric		Can someone help with an ATI 9800 driver install?  I've followed various instructions I've found, but still seem to be stuck in MESA mode :(  I'm not sure what info to give, I've not seen any error.  (xorg.conf: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/8662,  dmesg: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/8663, messages: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/8664)
2006-02-19T15:36:00.000Z	twb	Cylindric	what does "lspci | grep VGA" return?
2006-02-19T15:37:00.000Z	twb	Cylindric	ew.
2006-02-19T15:37:00.000Z	twb	Cylindric	I was hoping for something like "0000:01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: ATI Technologies Inc Radeon RV250 If [Radeon 9000]  (rev 01)"
2006-02-19T15:38:00.000Z	twb	Cylindric	Oh!
2006-02-19T15:38:00.000Z	twb	Cylindric	lemme get you to try something...
2006-02-19T15:39:00.000Z	twb	Cylindric	as root, open /etc/X11/xorg.conf in your favourite editor (e.g. nano)
2006-02-19T15:39:00.000Z	twb	Cylindric	look for 'Device "ati"'
2006-02-19T15:39:00.000Z	twb	Cylindric	or 'Device "vesa"'
2006-02-19T15:40:00.000Z	twb	Cylindric	and change it to 'Device "radeon"'
2006-02-19T15:40:00.000Z	Cylindric	twb	I have 'Section "Device"' with a line 'Driver "fglrx"',
2006-02-19T15:41:00.000Z	twb	Cylindric	Oh, you are trying to use the non-free drivers.
2006-02-19T15:41:00.000Z	twb	Cylindric	is it working?
2006-02-19T15:41:00.000Z	Cylindric	twb	I tried the ATI ones first, and they're not .  Should I be using others?
2006-02-19T15:41:00.000Z	twb	Cylindric	the free driver "radeon" should give you 2d and probably 3d acceleration.
2006-02-19T15:42:00.000Z	twb	Cylindric	the free driver "ati" is much older than "radeon".
2006-02-19T15:42:00.000Z	Cylindric	twb	do I need to download anything extra, or just change Driver to "radeon"?
2006-02-19T15:42:00.000Z	twb	Cylindric	change it, save file, restart X server (Ctrl+Alt+Backspace)
2006-02-19T15:43:00.000Z	twb	Cylindric	you can test for 3d accel by running glxinfo|head and looking for "direct rendering: yes"
