2006-05-19T11:06:00.000Z	siccness		Is Linux or Ubuntu designed to use up RAM?
2006-05-19T11:06:00.000Z	siccness		Thought so.
2006-05-19T11:07:00.000Z	siccness		What's interesting is that, 3 days ago, i run memtest86..perfect, not an error. I do it 5mins ago and I get a 21 errors in test#3
2006-05-19T11:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	siccness	 may want to remove/reseat the ram and test again
2006-05-19T11:08:00.000Z	siccness	Dr_Willis	So it's probbaly not good to leave my computer running?
2006-05-19T11:08:00.000Z	siccness		(cuz I can't really remove/resit ram atm)
2006-05-19T11:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	siccness	 my bet is that if the ram is having issues.. you may be crashing more often.. and could get all sorts of odd errors
2006-05-19T11:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	siccness	 so how imporntant is the work that its doing right now. :P
2006-05-19T11:09:00.000Z	siccness		No crashing issues whatsoever. Infact, feels pretty good.
2006-05-19T11:09:00.000Z	siccness		Just curious to know why memtest always has a bitch
2006-05-19T11:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	siccness	 currupted data files - can be annoying as well.
2006-05-19T11:09:00.000Z	siccness		Yeah, nothing corrupted.
2006-05-19T11:09:00.000Z	siccness		Checked all that.
2006-05-19T11:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	siccness	  nothing that youve seen yet. :P
2006-05-19T11:09:00.000Z	siccness	Dr_Willis	True, but I had my old memory chip run with errors for 2yrs and not a problem.
2006-05-19T11:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	siccness	 could swap the ram chips around and see if the problem follows the chip or the socket.
2006-05-19T11:10:00.000Z	siccness	Dr_Willis	Can't even boot properly in othe other 2 slots
2006-05-19T11:10:00.000Z	siccness		DFI Motherboads are a joke.
2006-05-19T11:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	siccness	 ya just got the 1 ram chip?
