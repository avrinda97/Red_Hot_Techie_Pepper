2006-03-16T16:24:00.000Z	MyST1C	selbstmord	whats wrong? are there any errors?
2006-03-16T16:25:00.000Z	selbstmord	MyST1C	Nah, I just get the "please wait" screen and then nothing happens. And if I try to run it in winxp-mode, it says "Fallout requires at least 20mb of free hd space"
2006-03-16T16:25:00.000Z	selbstmord	MyST1C	Kinda sucks, seeing as playing Fallout is my only gaming-wish for linux at all
2006-03-16T16:27:00.000Z	MyST1C	selbstmord	it should work. what if you try something other then xp?
2006-03-16T16:28:00.000Z	selbstmord	MyST1C	I did, I tried all of them, win2k, NT, win98, win95, and all I get is the "please wait" screen and nothing happens
