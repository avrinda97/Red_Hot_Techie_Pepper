2011-10-24T18:52:00.000Z	Bear10		hmm
2011-10-24T18:53:00.000Z	Bear10		no one know why i can't ping my fresh install of ubuntu server?
2011-10-24T18:55:00.000Z	HawkI_	Bear10	is the system connected to the network?
2011-10-24T18:55:00.000Z	Bear10	HawkI_	yes the server can ping to anything on the LAN but I can't ping to it
2011-10-24T18:55:00.000Z	HawkI_	Bear10	"the server" is the Ubuntu system you referred to?
2011-10-24T18:55:00.000Z	Bear10		yes
2011-10-24T18:56:00.000Z	Bear10	HawkI_	yeah the Ubuntu Server installation
2011-10-24T18:56:00.000Z	HawkI_	Bear10	have you configured the system to respond to I CMP calls/probes question mark
2011-10-24T18:56:00.000Z	Bear10	HawkI_	no is that necessary on a fresh install??
2011-10-24T18:58:00.000Z	HawkI_	Bear10	I don't think so, but... echo 0 >/proc/sys/net/ipv4/icmp_echo_ignore_all
2011-10-24T18:58:00.000Z	HawkI_		   is a command that disables ignoring them, I think
2011-10-24T18:58:00.000Z	HawkI_		I'm a bit rusty there.
2011-10-24T18:59:00.000Z	Bear10		okay will try
2011-10-24T19:01:00.000Z	Bear10	HawkI_	hmm just tried that when i ping to it i still get a destination unreachable
2011-10-24T19:01:00.000Z	Bear10		but actually im seeing something really odd
2011-10-24T19:02:00.000Z	HawkI_	Bear10	yes?
2011-10-24T19:02:00.000Z	Bear10		my windows machine is doing something strange
2011-10-24T19:02:00.000Z	Bear10		let me check into it a little more
2011-10-24T19:04:00.000Z	Bear10	HawkI_	LOL i found the problem
