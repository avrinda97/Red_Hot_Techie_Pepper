2008-11-18T19:24:00.000Z	zeno___		how does one specify the username/pw when mounting a nfs share?
2008-11-18T19:25:00.000Z	PeskyJ	zeno___	how are you mounting it, from the command line or from nautilus?
2008-11-18T19:27:00.000Z	zeno___	PeskyJ	command line i dont know how to via nautilus
2008-11-18T19:27:00.000Z	PeskyJ	zeno___	what is your end goal? for example to mount a drive temporarily for one session, to always have it mounted whenever you log in,?
2008-11-18T19:27:00.000Z	zeno___	PeskyJ	login
2008-11-18T19:30:00.000Z	PeskyJ	zeno___	ok well you should read the man page on fstab and mount to understand how they work... then you need to add an entry to /etc/fstab and provide credentials
2008-11-18T19:31:00.000Z	zeno___	PeskyJ	i did, but in the man page i didnt seen a option for username and password
2008-11-18T19:32:00.000Z	PeskyJ	zeno___	is it a windows/samba share?
2008-11-18T19:33:00.000Z	zeno___	PeskyJ	its a nfs share, it has a samba share also though.  if i could just mount the samba share somehow that would b great
2008-11-18T19:34:00.000Z	PeskyJ	zeno___	I can't remember exactly how to do it but there's some extra options to pass to mount that pass it on to the mount.smbfs program to give a credentials file
2008-11-18T19:34:00.000Z	zeno___	PeskyJ	ok thx
2008-11-18T19:35:00.000Z	PeskyJ	zeno___	well that was under debian a long while back, not sure if ubuntu uses the same thing as there's been development since then and also I noticed ubuntu uses this fuse/gvfs mounter thing which I don't really understand yet
2008-11-18T19:41:00.000Z	zeno___	PeskyJ	ah got it working with smbfs thankd for all help
2008-11-18T19:41:00.000Z	PeskyJ	zeno___	np mate.. you did all the work yourself I just made random pointers/suggestions ;)
2008-11-18T19:43:00.000Z	zeno___	PeskyJ	hmmm wierd though i used the admin account and im getting permission denied when attempting to copy files
2008-11-18T19:44:00.000Z	PeskyJ	zeno___	the admin account in ubuntu is a normal user account, you need to use sudo to do things as root... you probably just need to change the (group most likely) permissions on your mount point
2008-11-18T19:44:00.000Z	zeno___	PeskyJ	the admin account is root on the nas im using
2008-11-18T19:46:00.000Z	zeno___	PeskyJ	i have them correct cause if i change password to mount with it gives error
2008-11-18T19:48:00.000Z	PeskyJ	zeno___	oh you mean you're getting permission errors on the remote machine?
