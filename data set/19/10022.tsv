2006-11-28T16:11:00.000Z	sc0tt		what errors did you get luke_?
2006-11-28T16:12:00.000Z	sc0tt		strange
2006-11-28T16:12:00.000Z	sc0tt		type: "which Xgl"
2006-11-28T16:13:00.000Z	luke_	sc0tt	nothing
2006-11-28T16:13:00.000Z	luke_	sc0tt	 :)
2006-11-28T16:15:00.000Z	sc0tt	luke_	it looks like the Xgl package wasn't installed
2006-11-28T16:16:00.000Z	luke_	sc0tt	 that seems to make sense.  Some of the files in synaptic were different than what showed up on the how-to.  I figured it was out of date
2006-11-28T16:19:00.000Z	sc0tt	luke_	type "pico /etc/gdm/gdm.conf-custom"
2006-11-28T16:21:00.000Z	luke_	sc0tt	 heh... how do I page back up and scroll through in text mode?
2006-11-28T16:21:00.000Z	luke_	sc0tt	 just beeps at me
2006-11-28T16:21:00.000Z	luke_	sc0tt	 nope... doesn't seem to be interactive at all.
2006-11-28T16:23:00.000Z	luke_	sc0tt	 tried several times.  It just beeps back at me from the CPU speaker
2006-11-28T16:29:00.000Z	luke_	sc0tt	 wait... we moved it
2006-11-28T16:31:00.000Z	luke_	sc0tt	 ok sweet, this is one of the files I modified
2006-11-28T16:35:00.000Z	luke_	sc0tt	 you're my hero.  Back in Gnome
2006-11-28T16:42:00.000Z	luke_	sc0tt	 so quick theory question.  What did putting the # actually do.  I take it # is a command of some type?
2006-11-28T16:43:00.000Z	sc0tt	luke_	# makes that line a comment
2006-11-28T16:44:00.000Z	luke_	sc0tt	 ROFL...  oh man that so explains something I was doing the other day.  Glad I asked
2006-11-28T16:52:00.000Z	luke_	sc0tt	 thanks again...
