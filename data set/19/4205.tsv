2010-02-11T13:27:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	hsunda3	if you don't get an answer in this channel you might also want to try in #ubuntu-server, they typically have more experience with RAID hardware
2010-02-11T13:27:00.000Z	hsunda3	ZykoticK9	hey good point, thanks didn't think of that
2010-03-12T03:44:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	hsunda3	short answer -- Ubuntu doesn't update versions, unless there is a security fix -- use a PPA or backports if you want to upgrade programs
2010-03-12T03:46:00.000Z	hsunda3	ZykoticK9	ah .. so where do I find instructions for installing Firefox 3.6 on Karmic?
2010-03-12T03:47:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	hsunda3	see http://www.ubuntugeek.com/how-to-install-firefox-3-6-stable-from-ubuntu-ppa.html
2010-03-12T03:49:00.000Z	hsunda3	ZykoticK9	Cool, thanks for the link .. the link says "Firefox 3.6 stable" .. what does stable mean?
2010-03-12T03:49:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	hsunda3	there is also a Daily Build PPA out there
2010-03-12T03:49:00.000Z	hsunda3	ZykoticK9	nah that's ok, I have used your link and got it working :) Thank you
2010-03-12T03:57:00.000Z	hsunda3	ZykoticK9	Are you still there? I followed your instructions, and all I have now is a "Special transitional package for firefox 3.6" but none of the real stuff .. what do I do after following the instructions on the link you sent?
2010-03-12T03:58:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	hsunda3	not sure man...  I can try in a VM if you'd like.
2010-03-12T03:59:00.000Z	hsunda3	ZykoticK9	oh wait I think I need to do a apt-get upgrade and apt-get dist-upgrade following that
2010-03-12T04:01:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	hsunda3	sudo add-apt-repository ppa:mozillateam/firefox-stable && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install firefox-3.6 worked for me?
2010-03-12T04:02:00.000Z	hsunda3	ZykoticK9	and guess what, it lost the java plug in that it had earlier :(
2010-03-12T04:02:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	hsunda3	just reinstall your java plugin
2010-03-12T04:03:00.000Z	hsunda3	ZykoticK9	how do I do that? dpkg-reconfigure sun-java6-plugin doesn't work
2010-03-12T04:04:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	hsunda3	after installing ff3.6 how did you start it?
2010-03-12T04:06:00.000Z	hsunda3	ZykoticK9	I did what you did, apt-get upgrade, apt-get dist-upgrade. This removed my old firefox, and all references now point to new firefox. This new firefox doesn't have Java plugin. Do I report this as a bug or what?
2010-03-12T04:07:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	hsunda3	perhaps reverting back to old firefox is a better idea?  don't think there is an integrated way to report bugs from PPA installs of programs.
