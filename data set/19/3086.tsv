2012-01-04T20:04:00.000Z	KrisDouglas		Chrome, firefox, chromium
2012-01-04T20:05:00.000Z	usr13	KrisDouglas	I'm thinking some plugin may be the culprit ...?
2012-01-04T20:05:00.000Z	KrisDouglas		I deleted the profiles for all 3 of them
2012-01-04T20:05:00.000Z	KrisDouglas		and I do not have flash player installed
2012-01-04T20:05:00.000Z	usr13	KrisDouglas	That wouldn't dissable plugins
2012-01-04T20:06:00.000Z	KrisDouglas		Let me run a safe mode firefox session, one mo :)
2012-01-04T20:06:00.000Z	usr13		Do you have foxfilter  installed?
2012-01-04T20:07:00.000Z	usr13	KrisDouglas	Do you have foxfilter  installed?
2012-01-04T20:07:00.000Z	usr13	KrisDouglas	Try lynx
2012-01-04T20:08:00.000Z	KrisDouglas	usr13	lynx runs like a dog, same as other browsers
2012-01-04T20:09:00.000Z	usr13	KrisDouglas	lynx -dump av.com
2012-01-04T20:09:00.000Z	KrisDouglas	usr13	loading
2012-01-04T20:11:00.000Z	usr13	KrisDouglas	tcpdump  #Run it in a terminal as you try and surf to pages and see what is happening.
2012-01-04T20:11:00.000Z	KrisDouglas	usr13	http://pastebin.com/dj6464A4
2012-01-04T20:12:00.000Z	KrisDouglas		sudo tcpdump* I assume usr13
2012-01-04T20:13:00.000Z	KrisDouglas	usr13	along with all of the irc traffic and some other badly switched data, I can't see anything unusual. I will try and dump, 1 sec
2012-01-04T20:16:00.000Z	KrisDouglas	usr13	it's difficult to get a worthwhile dump
2012-01-04T20:16:00.000Z	KrisDouglas	usr13	is there anything I should look out for?
