2007-01-05T12:01:00.000Z	Landon		Anyone know how to trouble shoot Samba?
2007-01-05T12:01:00.000Z	xtknight	Landon	what's the error youre getting?
2007-01-05T12:02:00.000Z	Landon	xtknight	I can't view one of the windows networks. It says it can't display the contents
2007-01-05T12:02:00.000Z	Landon	xtknight	Even though it has done it before
2007-01-05T12:02:00.000Z	xtknight	Landon	has anything changed since then?  domain/workgroups/computer names/etc?
2007-01-05T12:03:00.000Z	Landon	xtknight	We added a new network, and one computer name has changed. We also changed the router
2007-01-05T12:05:00.000Z	xtknight	Landon	have you tried mounting the shares using CIFS?
2007-01-05T12:06:00.000Z	Landon	xtknight	Don't know what that is
2007-01-05T12:08:00.000Z	xtknight	Landon	ok.  i have to go soon, you can try mounting the shares with CIFS    :  sudo apt-get install smbfs     and then 'apropos cifs'   for a manual page on CIFS and how to mount stuff
2007-01-05T12:09:00.000Z	Landon	xtknight	 thanks, I'll try that
2007-01-05T12:09:00.000Z	xtknight	Landon	if i recall it's something like     mount -t cifs -o username=USER,password=asdf //computername/share/   /mnt/mountpoint
2007-01-05T12:09:00.000Z	xtknight	Landon	i do know that you can not mount a whole computer.  it must be one share
2007-01-05T12:09:00.000Z	Landon	xtknight	That's fine, I can go one at a time
2007-01-05T12:09:00.000Z	Landon	xtknight	Thanks again
2007-01-05T12:09:00.000Z	xtknight	Landon	i also know that cifs works sometimes while nautilus can not see shares
2007-01-05T12:10:00.000Z	xtknight	Landon	no problem, ill be around later.
2007-01-05T12:10:00.000Z	Landon	xtknight	I'll try catching you then if I have any problems
2007-01-05T12:10:00.000Z	xtknight		ok
2007-01-05T12:10:00.000Z	xtknight	Landon	should be an hour or so.
