2009-08-05T14:27:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	grawity	10 minutes is hardly a lifetime :p
2009-08-05T14:28:00.000Z	grawity	b3rz3rk3r	At least it has the advantage of being free. (There are other public DNS services, but they aren't that known)
2009-08-05T14:29:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	grawity	true true
2009-08-07T20:03:00.000Z	grawity	b3rz3rk3r	I thought OperaTor is just a bundle of Opera+Tor+Privoxy.
2009-08-07T20:04:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	grawity	yes, but its combined already, so its easy for the beginner to use
2009-08-07T20:04:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	grawity	nothing to config or activate.. just click and use :)
2009-08-08T22:48:00.000Z	grawity	b3rz3rk3r	about:config --> new String entry --> network.security.ports.banned.override --> 1-65535 --> OK
2009-08-08T22:49:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	grawity	great.. thx man :)
2009-08-08T22:50:00.000Z	grawity	b3rz3rk3r	:9091 is not a "known" port -- it's in the "can be used for anything" range.
2009-08-08T22:51:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	grawity	yeah, just the default for freenas. and i guess they have to allow :80 :p
2009-08-08T22:51:00.000Z	grawity	b3rz3rk3r	21, 80, 443, and all those above 1024.
2009-08-08T22:52:00.000Z	grawity	b3rz3rk3r	On Unix systems, to run a server on port below 1024 one needs root privilege.
2009-08-08T22:52:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	grawity	thats good to know in the future. Thanks for you help!
2009-08-21T19:23:00.000Z	grawity	b3rz3rk3r	Only if it logs clean files too.
2009-08-27T20:24:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	grawity	lol
