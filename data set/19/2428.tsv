2010-04-15T23:48:00.000Z	slackster		hi, I'm wondering where the file is that defines which services are to start/run?
2010-04-15T23:48:00.000Z	slackster		init.d?
2010-04-15T23:50:00.000Z	slackster		hi, I'm wondering where the file is that defines which services are to start/run?
2010-04-15T23:51:00.000Z	crucialhoax	slackster	Like the rc.S files?
2010-04-15T23:51:00.000Z	slackster	crucialhoax	maybe... like rc.d in freebsd
2010-04-15T23:51:00.000Z	crucialhoax	slackster	Are you wanting to clean up the boot process?
2010-04-15T23:52:00.000Z	slackster	crucialhoax	yea, just stop unwanted services from running...things like apache2, but not that
2010-04-15T23:53:00.000Z	crucialhoax	slackster	Give me a moment while I find that bookmark lol
2010-04-15T23:53:00.000Z	slackster	crucialhoax	oh, great... thanks  I was thinking /etc/init.d as that is what you call to start/stop stuff.. but looking at the file.. I don't know
2010-04-15T23:54:00.000Z	crucialhoax	slackster	init.d is what spawns the processes yes, but rc.d calls it at boot-time.
2010-04-15T23:55:00.000Z	slackster	crucialhoax	oh, great... thanks. Going to have a look
2010-04-15T23:55:00.000Z	slackster	crucialhoax	rc.d is what path?
2010-04-15T23:56:00.000Z	crucialhoax	slackster	One sec. I believe you can just do an update-rc.d remove <name> but let me see.
2010-04-15T23:57:00.000Z	crucialhoax	slackster	When I did what you are trying to a few weeks ago I did `sudo update-rc.d -f <name of boot item to remove> remove`
2010-04-15T23:58:00.000Z	slackster	crucialhoax	ah, thanks.. this method is better than stopping the service and commenting out the config file :P
2010-04-15T23:58:00.000Z	crucialhoax	slackster	If not, read this thread. You do not have to install the bootcharts, just follow it. http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=89491
2010-04-15T23:58:00.000Z	slackster	crucialhoax	great. I'll take note of it and check it out when I'm back to my GUI
2010-04-15T23:58:00.000Z	crucialhoax	slackster	The method I supplied?
2010-04-15T23:59:00.000Z	crucialhoax	slackster	Yes, that link is very helpful lol. Maybe not in lynx tho haha. But good luck :)
