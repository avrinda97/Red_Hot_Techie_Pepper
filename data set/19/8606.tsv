2009-05-01T11:19:00.000Z	Andy242		hi sebsebseb -  no matter how many times I run the MD5 etc. and d/l the ubuntu server to install
2009-05-01T11:20:00.000Z	Andy242		I always get a debootstrap error
2009-05-01T11:20:00.000Z	Andy242		'file://xxxxx/' is corrupt
2009-05-01T11:21:00.000Z	Andy242		sebsebseb- the error is 'file:///cdrom/pool/main/u/ubuntu-meta/ubntu-minimal_1.140_i386.deb was corrupt
2009-05-01T11:21:00.000Z	Andy242		thanks sebsebseb
2009-05-01T11:21:00.000Z	Andy242		strangely though, when I check the CD if it's intact, it passes
2009-05-01T11:22:00.000Z	Andy242		tried that :( I'm burning at 1x :(
2009-05-01T11:23:00.000Z	Andy242		I've naturally googled this, but there's nothing out there
2009-05-01T11:23:00.000Z	Andy242		it's nuts
2009-05-01T11:23:00.000Z	MrEgg964	Andy242	where did you d/l the iso from?
2009-05-01T11:27:00.000Z	Andy242		hey losher! thanks
2009-05-01T11:27:00.000Z	Andy242		yes, I have
2009-05-01T11:28:00.000Z	Andy242		and it passes ok when you check the cd for defects
2009-05-01T11:30:00.000Z	Andy242	losher	hmmm- good point, it's a machine we got given by a colleague
2009-05-01T11:30:00.000Z	Andy242		any way I could look into that?
2009-05-01T11:32:00.000Z	Andy242	losher	yeah, I think that'd be the way forward too- I just heard great things for 9.04
2009-05-01T11:32:00.000Z	Andy242		ok, thanks for your time guys!
2009-05-01T11:33:00.000Z	MrEgg964	Andy242	can you possibly try the cd on a different system?
