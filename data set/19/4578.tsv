2012-08-20T22:30:00.000Z	TriBeCa99		which means i can't sudo, apparently
2012-08-20T22:31:00.000Z	TriBeCa99		nm i'll just google it
2012-08-20T22:32:00.000Z	TriBeCa99		is it f6 to get the grub menu?
2012-08-20T22:33:00.000Z	TriBeCa99		apparently not
2012-08-20T22:33:00.000Z	minimec	TriBeCa99	left<shift> button after your BIOS boot screen.
2012-08-20T22:33:00.000Z	TriBeCa99	minimec	ty
2012-08-20T23:16:00.000Z	minimec	TriBeCa99	Change the user rights of the old /home directory... SOmething like 'sudo chown youruser:youruser /home/youruser'
2012-08-20T23:16:00.000Z	minimec	TriBeCa99	In your case /media/home probably...
2012-08-20T23:16:00.000Z	TriBeCa99	minimec	the old home no longer exists
2012-08-20T23:17:00.000Z	TriBeCa99	minimec	but i'm in as root, permissions shouldn't matter?
2012-08-20T23:18:00.000Z	minimec	TriBeCa99	I did not follow the whole story. You got a backup of you old /home/youname directory, and that one is read only?
2012-08-20T23:19:00.000Z	TriBeCa99	minimec	when i try to copy it say /home is read only
2012-08-20T23:20:00.000Z	minimec	TriBeCa99	Is that a new clean install, you did?
2012-08-20T23:21:00.000Z	TriBeCa99	minimec	No, I'm trying to migrate /home from a 4 disk RAID10 to a new 4 disk RAID10
2012-08-20T23:22:00.000Z	minimec	TriBeCa99	Ok. I am sorry, I probably cannot help you with RAID problems. I guess, there's a RAID configuration problem..
2012-08-20T23:22:00.000Z	TriBeCa99	minimec	for now the raid is not the issue
2012-08-20T23:22:00.000Z	TriBeCa99	minimec	for now i just need to move /home from the raid to the device that's mounting /
2012-08-20T23:27:00.000Z	minimec	TriBeCa99	Ok. So you got a /media/home directory mounted, and a the normal /home of the system? Couldn't you just rename that /media/home to /media/home-backup, and then 'sudo mv /media/home-backup /'? Then boot into recovery mode, drop to a root shell, delete /home and 'sudo mv /home-backup /home'?
2012-08-20T23:28:00.000Z	TriBeCa99	minimec	as I've been saying, when I try to copy to /home from the root shell I get a "read-only file system" error
