2007-09-20T14:05:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter		when running windows xp in virtual box where can i locate the C; drive in linux? I want to send some apps from my windows partition to my virtual windows "if that even makes sense"?
2007-09-20T14:06:00.000Z	dystopianray	Pirate_Hunter	you have to mount the hdd image
2007-09-20T14:08:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	dystopianray	Evanlec: is there a way I can mount my windows partition into virtual box so i can access it like that, if there is how do I do it, cause if my apps work well in virtual box there is no need to keep my windows partition
2007-09-20T14:09:00.000Z	dystopianray	Pirate_Hunter	should be able to access it via samba
2007-10-06T13:42:00.000Z	dystopianray	Pirate_Hunter	'exit' or press ctrl+d
2007-10-06T13:43:00.000Z	dystopianray	Pirate_Hunter	sudo -k
2007-10-06T13:48:00.000Z	dystopianray	Pirate_Hunter	packages.ubuntu.com
2007-10-06T13:48:00.000Z	dystopianray	Pirate_Hunter	you'll need to install build-essential if you want to do C or C++ programming
2007-10-06T13:49:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	dystopianray	thats a needle in a haystack I was hoping for something more obvious than that which has suggested programs that ueser have used... I hate getting apps only to find out they are crap
2007-10-06T13:49:00.000Z	dystopianray	Pirate_Hunter	what sort of app are you specifically looking for?
2007-10-06T13:50:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	dystopianray	we could start with a good html editor, VB - c++ compiler
2007-10-06T13:50:00.000Z	dystopianray	Pirate_Hunter	html editor = any text editor, there is no VB compiler, build-essentialf or C/C++
2007-10-06T13:51:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	dystopianray	your telling me they haven't got something close to frontpage for ubuntu that can't be right
2007-10-06T13:52:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	dystopianray	well thanx ill look into those
2007-10-06T13:52:00.000Z	dystopianray	Pirate_Hunter	frontpage is a horrible piece of crap
2007-10-06T13:52:00.000Z	dystopianray	Pirate_Hunter	there are WYSIWYG web page creators, but they are usually always terrible
2007-10-06T13:53:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	dystopianray	(-_-) I know but sometimes its about productivity how much cna I do with an app like that wihtout having to remember all the tags especially since I'll have to do more than one assignment at a time
2007-10-06T13:54:00.000Z	dystopianray	Pirate_Hunter	if you check packages.ubuntu.com there should be several WYSIWYG web page creators
2007-10-06T13:55:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	dystopianray	yeha will do now going to boot to xp and finish installing what i was doing last night
