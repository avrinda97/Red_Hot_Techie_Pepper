2011-07-12T16:46:00.000Z	llutz_	billy2007	wifi-accesspoint
2011-07-12T16:47:00.000Z	llutz_	billy2007	hidden-ssid?
2011-07-12T17:05:00.000Z	llutz_	billy2007	no, it would need a special driver letting your pc acting as a usb-networkcard for your iphone
2011-07-12T17:07:00.000Z	llutz_	billy2007	no idea, i neither use windows nor an iphone
2011-07-12T17:08:00.000Z	llutz_	billy2007	i'd check why the iphone cannot connect to your working wifi-network first
2011-07-12T17:09:00.000Z	llutz_	billy2007	your pc is connected to internet only via wifi, no wire-lan?
2011-07-12T17:11:00.000Z	llutz_	billy2007	what wifi-chipset? you have to create something like a virtual (2nd) wifi-device, which let you connect via ad-hoc connection. i know atheros-chips could do that
2011-07-12T17:13:00.000Z	llutz_	billy2007	so you already have 2 wifi-devices?
2011-07-12T17:14:00.000Z	llutz_	billy2007	try to establish an ad-hoc to the wg111t
2011-07-12T17:15:00.000Z	llutz_	billy2007	iphone <-> wg111t          then try to setup ip-forwarding/masquerading with your internal-wifi as WAN-iface
2011-07-12T17:17:00.000Z	llutz_	billy2007	sorry no idea how to do that with networkmanager. try using iwconfig, at least to setup the wg111t, without touching the internal
2011-07-12T17:22:00.000Z	llutz_	billy2007	should be installed already, comes with package "wireless-tools"
2011-07-12T17:22:00.000Z	llutz_	billy2007	its a commandline tool
2011-07-12T17:24:00.000Z	llutz_	billy2007	i doubt theres a gui-tool for what you need to do
2011-07-12T17:25:00.000Z	llutz_	billy2007	easier to buy an old wifi-router, put dd-wrt on it and let it work as wifi-repeater :)
2011-07-12T17:28:00.000Z	llutz_	billy2007	what won't connect? the iphone or ad-hoc -> internet?
2011-07-12T17:31:00.000Z	llutz_	billy2007	does the usb-stick work unter linux at all?
2011-07-12T17:32:00.000Z	llutz_	billy2007	sorry no idea what to do
