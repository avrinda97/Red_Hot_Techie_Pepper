2006-01-17T15:58:00.000Z	CarinArr		what's up with ubuntuforums
2006-01-17T16:00:00.000Z	CarinArr		i'm having some really weird problems with my nvidia driver.. basically i need to run more recent drivers than the ones available through synaptic, so i uninstalled the synaptic ones and installed the latest drivers from nvidia.. Now it works perfectly, until I reboot.. after I reboot, I get the nvidia flash screen and can log in as normal, but if i try to run nvidia-settings or any software that uses opengl, i get segmentation faults
2006-01-17T16:00:00.000Z	CarinArr		if i reinstall the driver it works fine, until i reboot.. etc
2006-01-17T16:01:00.000Z	CarinArr		i tried to stop gdm, and do "startx -- -verbose 5 -logverbose 5", and then it just hangs on a half black half white screen and the log stops at (II) Initializing extension GLX
2006-01-17T16:02:00.000Z	CarinArr		anyone who's any good with nvidia problems?
2006-01-17T16:02:00.000Z	cas	CarinArr	did you installed the right kernelheaders for your current kernel
2006-01-17T16:02:00.000Z	cas	CarinArr	You need someone who's good with solutions not problems ;)
2006-01-17T16:03:00.000Z	CarinArr	cas	yeah, the kernel module compiles absolutely fine
2006-01-17T16:03:00.000Z	cas	CarinArr	can you find something in your xorg logs?
2006-01-17T16:03:00.000Z	CarinArr		heh cas, true that, was posting in that nvidia thread on ubuntuforums and someone was trying to help out, but i can't get on ubuntuforums.org at all now
2006-01-17T16:03:00.000Z	CarinArr	cas	only "(II) Initializing extension GLX
2006-01-17T16:03:00.000Z	CarinArr	cas	then it dies
2006-01-17T16:04:00.000Z	CarinArr	cas	but it's weird because straight upon rebooting the driver seems to load fine, no errors in the logs or anything, and the  nvidia splash screen is all there and fine
2006-01-17T16:04:00.000Z	CarinArr		it's only when i try to run anything that uses it that it seems to go kaboom
2006-01-17T16:05:00.000Z	cas	CarinArr	maybe some old nvidia driver is also loading
2006-01-17T16:05:00.000Z	CarinArr	cas	no.. there's no indication it is anywhere
2006-01-17T16:06:00.000Z	cas	CarinArr	try removing every nvidia thingy before installing the new one
2006-01-17T16:06:00.000Z	cas	CarinArr	also /etc/init.d/nvidia-*
2006-01-17T16:06:00.000Z	CarinArr	cas	done it.. no difference
