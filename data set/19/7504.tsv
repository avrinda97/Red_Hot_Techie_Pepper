2007-10-30T16:32:00.000Z	shearn89	kidbuntu	messed up how?
2007-10-30T16:33:00.000Z	kidbuntu	shearn89	theres no max,min,close button on my title bar, no icons on my menus, my typing behavior changed like i have to repeatedly press the backspace to move back.
2007-10-30T16:34:00.000Z	shearn89	kidbuntu	sounds like your xorg is messed up. Although not sure about the keybindings thing...
2007-10-30T16:34:00.000Z	kidbuntu	shearn89	is there a way to fix that? can you help me with it
2007-10-30T16:35:00.000Z	shearn89	kidbuntu	not sure... what did you do prior to it breaking?
2007-10-30T16:36:00.000Z	kidbuntu	shearn89	did a sudo apt-get --purge remove compiz* libcompizconfig
2007-10-30T16:36:00.000Z	kidbuntu	shearn89	then metacity --replace..
2007-10-30T16:37:00.000Z	shearn89	kidbuntu	sounds like some dependencies got screwed. Try "apt-get install --reinstall metacity"
2007-10-30T16:37:00.000Z	kidbuntu	shearn89	ok
2007-10-30T16:38:00.000Z	kidbuntu	shearn89	after doing that.. whats next?
2007-10-30T16:38:00.000Z	shearn89	kidbuntu	try restarting X (ctrl-alt-backspace). Then sign on to irc again, and tell us what happened.
2007-10-30T16:39:00.000Z	kidbuntu	shearn89	i'm on my emerald theme currently
2007-10-30T16:39:00.000Z	shearn89	kidbuntu	oh! thats probs it - if you've removed all the compiz stuff, the emerald theme won't render properly.
2007-10-30T16:39:00.000Z	kidbuntu	shearn89	no... compiz and emerald are working fine now.. but the metacity is not
2007-10-30T16:41:00.000Z	shearn89	kidbuntu	hmm... try asking in the #ubuntu-effects channel. or
2007-10-30T16:41:00.000Z	shearn89	kidbuntu	#compiz-fusion
