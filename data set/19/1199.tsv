2011-04-21T07:24:00.000Z	LinuxHack3r		I just completed my first ever build. I have an i7 2600k, 8600gt, 8gb g.skill ram, lots of fans, 3 sata hard drives. I installed Ubuntu 10.10 fresh after build, and now I'm having random program restarts/system freezes. I mean, more freezes within the last 2 hours than my other 5 years of linux combined. Any suggested culprits? I have a 600w PSU. I'm afraid that it isn't enough. Where should I start?
2011-04-21T07:25:00.000Z	LinuxHack3r		Note it only freezes/restarts programs when I'm doing something intensive, like encoding and listening to music.
2011-04-21T07:26:00.000Z	taglass	LinuxHack3r	test your memory
2011-04-21T07:27:00.000Z	LinuxHack3r	taglass	In my bios? I will.
2011-04-21T07:28:00.000Z	taglass	LinuxHack3r	not a clue.  I just know RAM can be bad when you buy it.  Always check RAM and cooling when you get weird crashes like that.
2011-04-21T07:28:00.000Z	LinuxHack3r	taglass	So if it is bad ram, I'll have to RMA won't I? I am entirely open to the idea though of my not knowing what I'm doing. First biuld.
2011-04-21T07:29:00.000Z	LinuxHack3r	taglass	How long would 8gb of ram take to test in BIOS?
2011-04-21T07:29:00.000Z	taglass	LinuxHack3r	Yeah you'll have to return it, and it will take a pretty good while
2011-04-21T07:29:00.000Z	taglass	LinuxHack3r	I'd do it overnight
2011-04-21T07:29:00.000Z	LinuxHack3r	taglass	Ok, just wondering, because I have to finish this paper.
2011-04-21T07:30:00.000Z	taglass	LinuxHack3r	Should probably just limp along as best you can and check the ram tonight.
2011-04-21T07:30:00.000Z	LinuxHack3r	taglass	And oh yeah! I remember, when I killed X/gdm to install my nvidia driver, when I ran the ./Nvidia**.sh command, the first two times I tried I was getting some sort of "fault" error or so. Suggests ram I suppose doesn't it?
2011-04-21T07:30:00.000Z	LinuxHack3r	taglass	I think I remember seeing the word "segmentation".
2011-04-21T07:31:00.000Z	taglass	LinuxHack3r	Sound like it, but then again you said problems only show up under load which suggests heat.
2011-04-21T07:31:00.000Z	LinuxHack3r	taglass	Well, lm-sensors doesn't detect me newer motherboard, any ideas?
2011-04-21T07:32:00.000Z	LinuxHack3r	taglass	First time I ever set a CPU and heatsink, I am open to admitting I did something wrong.
2011-04-21T07:32:00.000Z	taglass	LinuxHack3r	reboot and look at the temps in bios after it gets unstable I guess?  I mean it's not going to be accurate, but it should be close enough.
2011-04-21T07:32:00.000Z	LinuxHack3r	taglass	I tried, 50*C....I guess in the freeze/reboot it cools pretty quick?
2011-04-21T07:37:00.000Z	LinuxHack3r	taglass	Just a thought, since I seem to be able to get the issue to present itself quickly (within 5 minutes), wouldn't a check at the BIOS level of memory present itself just as quickly?
