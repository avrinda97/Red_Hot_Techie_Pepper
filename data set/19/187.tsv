2012-07-16T10:01:00.000Z	iharp		how can I run an x-executable from terminal if it's in a random folder that I placed in "home"?
2012-07-16T10:01:00.000Z	iharp		so if I'm in terminal and I want to type "adb" and want to have it start
2012-07-16T10:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	iharp	if you put it in /usr/bin it will be accessible without a path
2012-07-16T10:02:00.000Z	iharp		yeah
2012-07-16T10:03:00.000Z	iharp	ActionParsnip	It's part of Android_SDK. Wouldn't it have to stay in the oringinal folder?
2012-07-16T10:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	iharp	you can add the path to the binary to the end of your PATH if you want. Probably better
2012-07-16T10:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	iharp	or use what aoo said :)
2012-07-16T10:04:00.000Z	iharp		Is that the "PATH=$PATH"  that you are refferencing to?
2012-07-16T10:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	iharp	export PATH=$PATH:/new/folder/to/add
2012-07-16T10:06:00.000Z	iharp		And that will allow everything executable in that folder to be run from the terminal?
2012-07-16T10:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	iharp	without using the full path, yes
2012-07-16T10:07:00.000Z	iharp		ok. thanks
2012-07-16T10:08:00.000Z	iharp	ActionParsnip	Now when I run the file it says. Insufficent permissions, but I've tried sudo and root..
2012-07-16T10:08:00.000Z	iharp		And it's marked as exec.
2012-07-16T10:12:00.000Z	iharp		same result
2012-07-16T10:14:00.000Z	iharp		Disregard. It's permissions for the device
2012-07-16T10:15:00.000Z	iharp		read that wrong
2012-07-16T10:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	iharp	is the file marked as executable?
2012-07-16T11:06:00.000Z	iharp	ActionParsnip	i read it wrong. it was the device that i was having an issue with. I figured it out
