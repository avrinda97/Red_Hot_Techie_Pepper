2009-09-30T11:28:00.000Z	paipimenta		oh man, how the hell do I edit this menu.lst file?? all I can use is cat, echo....
2009-09-30T11:28:00.000Z	mgmuscari	paipimenta	do you have sed by any chance?
2009-09-30T11:29:00.000Z	mgmuscari	paipimenta	don't use sed
2009-09-30T11:30:00.000Z	mgmuscari	paipimenta	that would replace the first instance of lv_root on a line with lvroot
2009-09-30T11:32:00.000Z	paipimenta	mgmuscari	what's wrong with that?
2009-10-04T11:41:00.000Z	mgmuscari	paipimenta	uh oh, filesystem trouble?
2009-10-04T11:43:00.000Z	mgmuscari	paipimenta	i resized an ext4 partition the other day, which was an extended partition
2009-10-04T11:43:00.000Z	mgmuscari	paipimenta	i think it totally blew away everything else on the logical partition that it was a part of...
2009-10-04T11:44:00.000Z	mgmuscari	paipimenta	i ended up running through fsck for about 2 days fixing things... then i had to back up the data that i could recover, blast away all my linux partitions, and start from scratch. so, be careful
2009-10-04T11:44:00.000Z	mgmuscari	paipimenta	yeah never run fsck or anything like it on a mounted partition, asking for trouble
2009-10-04T11:45:00.000Z	mgmuscari	paipimenta	sure it didn't automount it or something?
2009-10-04T11:45:00.000Z	mgmuscari	paipimenta	what error
2009-10-04T11:48:00.000Z	mgmuscari	paipimenta	i have all of my linux partitions on extended volumes
2009-10-04T11:49:00.000Z	mgmuscari	paipimenta	http://paste.ubuntu.com/285201/
2009-10-04T11:54:00.000Z	mgmuscari	paipimenta	install windows first
2009-10-04T11:54:00.000Z	mgmuscari	paipimenta	then install ubuntu and point grub to the windows partition
2009-10-04T11:56:00.000Z	mgmuscari	paipimenta	you need a bootloader to load that iso if you're not going to put it on a cd
2009-10-04T11:56:00.000Z	mgmuscari	paipimenta	i don't think that grub will do it, but i think you can use isolinux or syslinux...
2009-10-04T11:57:00.000Z	mgmuscari	paipimenta	i'm not 100% sure about that
