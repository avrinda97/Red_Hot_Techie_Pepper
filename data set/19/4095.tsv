2009-10-03T18:55:00.000Z	Josh_		apt-get errors that it can't resolve the server at us.archive.ubuntu.com
2009-10-03T18:56:00.000Z	Josh_		is this down, or is it just me?
2009-10-03T18:56:00.000Z	grawity	Josh_	Does 'host us.archive.ubuntu.com' work?
2009-10-03T18:56:00.000Z	Josh_	grawity	Nope, times out
2009-10-03T18:57:00.000Z	grawity	Josh_	Then your DNS server might be down... How about this: host us.archive.ubuntu.com 4.2.2.3
2009-10-03T18:59:00.000Z	Josh_	grawity	That timed out as well
2009-10-03T18:59:00.000Z	grawity	Josh_	Well, your router/ISP/DNS/whatever is broken  :(
2009-10-03T18:59:00.000Z	grawity	Josh_	Can you try, for example, 'host google.com'?
2009-10-03T19:00:00.000Z	Josh_	grawity	Nope, that times out, too
2009-10-03T19:01:00.000Z	grawity	Josh_	It really shouldn't be related to that.
2009-10-03T19:01:00.000Z	Josh_	grawity	Do you know how to troubleshoot internet?
2009-10-03T19:04:00.000Z	grawity	Josh_	you mean "external IP"?
2009-10-03T19:05:00.000Z	grawity	Josh_	Anyway, if ifconfig doesn't list anything else than loopback, you need to configure the network interface... do you use DHCP?
2009-10-03T19:05:00.000Z	Josh_	grawity	I don't know what I mean anymore.
2009-10-03T19:05:00.000Z	grawity	Josh_	For DHCP, sudo dhclient eth0
2009-10-03T19:06:00.000Z	Josh_	grawity	it says it bound to something
2009-10-03T19:06:00.000Z	grawity	Josh_	Now type 'ifconfig eth0' and see if it lists an IP address.
2009-10-03T19:07:00.000Z	Josh_	grawity	I now have an IP from my router. ^_^
2009-10-03T19:08:00.000Z	Josh_	grawity	It's working!
