2006-05-27T06:49:00.000Z	Terminus	miter	what does head "foo.bin|grep sh" say?
2006-05-27T06:49:00.000Z	Terminus	miter	if the file starts with #!/bin/sh, you can either chmod +x it or sh foo.sh
2006-05-27T06:50:00.000Z	Terminus	miter	sh foo.bin i mean.
2006-05-27T06:51:00.000Z	Terminus	miter	"file foo.bin" might also help you determine what it is. if you're sure it's a binary, chmod +x foo.bin and ./foo.bin
2006-05-27T06:51:00.000Z	Terminus	miter	yes.
2006-05-27T06:52:00.000Z	Terminus	miter	chmod it like i said above and then run it.
2006-05-27T06:52:00.000Z	Terminus	miter	yes. it also sets the execution flag.
2006-05-27T06:53:00.000Z	Terminus	miter	like i also said above, ./foo assuming it's in your current dir.
2006-05-27T06:55:00.000Z	Terminus	miter	sh is for scripts written in sh. for an article on the console, please see the current issue of free software magazine, downloadable as a pdf.
