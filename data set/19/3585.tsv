2011-11-02T06:26:00.000Z	bjorkintosh		all of a sudden, i've lost some icons.
2011-11-02T06:26:00.000Z	bjorkintosh		and sound no longer works in firefox.
2011-11-02T06:26:00.000Z	bjorkintosh		is this a known problem?
2011-11-02T06:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bjorkintosh	try closing the browser and restarting it
2011-11-02T06:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bjorkintosh	try:  killall pulseaudio; rm -r ~/.pulse; rm ~/.pulse-cookie
2011-11-02T06:33:00.000Z	bjorkintosh	ActionParsnip	and then rerun pulseaudio?
2011-11-02T06:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bjorkintosh	it will rerun itself after a few seconds, then try some sound stuff like vlc etc
2011-11-02T06:36:00.000Z	bjorkintosh	ActionParsnip	regular sounds worked just fine.
2011-11-02T06:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bjorkintosh	in flash you mean?
2011-11-02T06:37:00.000Z	bjorkintosh	ActionParsnip	yeah. your fix worked though.
2011-11-02T06:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bjorkintosh	np man
2012-10-24T02:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bjorkintosh	are you running 64bit OS?
2012-10-24T02:33:00.000Z	bjorkintosh	ActionParsnip	correct.
2012-10-24T02:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bjorkintosh	then you have onboard graphics which is using some system RAM for itself
2012-10-24T02:34:00.000Z	bjorkintosh	ActionParsnip	can i control that in any way?
2012-10-24T02:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bjorkintosh	you can probably set the amount of RAM used by the GeForce315M uses in BIOS
2012-10-24T02:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bjorkintosh	you can set swappiness lower and you will use RAM less
2012-10-24T02:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bjorkintosh	you have enough RAM for Ubuntu, I wouldn't sweat it
2012-10-24T02:58:00.000Z	bjorkintosh	ActionParsnip	you were correct about the ram usage.
