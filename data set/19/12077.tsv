2006-09-27T07:08:00.000Z	gnomefreak	omar	there will not be a linux build for flash 8

2006-09-27T07:09:00.000Z	gnomefreak	omar	it could be the page isnt working (you havent given me a page that gives you problems
2006-09-27T07:09:00.000Z	omar	gnomefreak	I tried 2 pages
2006-09-27T07:09:00.000Z	gnomefreak	omar	care to give me them so i can see what the issue is?
2006-09-27T07:10:00.000Z	omar	gnomefreak	ok there you go www.bws.com.pe and http://www.latinka.com/
2006-09-27T07:10:00.000Z	gnomefreak	omar	you cant open that page at all?
2006-09-27T07:11:00.000Z	omar	gnomefreak	I can open but I need the smaill part in flash, but latinka I cannot open
2006-09-27T07:12:00.000Z	gnomefreak	omar	can you give me what version of flash you are using? apt-cache policy flashplugin-nonfree    will give you version
2006-09-27T07:14:00.000Z	gnomefreak	omar	i open them without a problem (find out version) than make sure you are using flash. in browser address bar type about:plugins  and see if flash is there
2006-09-27T07:16:00.000Z	omar	gnomefreak	I can open but I need the smaill part in flash, but latinka I cannot open
2006-09-27T07:16:00.000Z	omar	gnomefreak	those are the versions
2006-09-27T07:17:00.000Z	gnomefreak	omar	check about:plugins see what it says about flash
2006-09-27T07:18:00.000Z	gnomefreak	omar	both pages opened here without a problem with flash installed (forgot to look at source)
