2008-05-02T03:33:00.000Z	sebsebseb		Matboy:  yes Ubuntu is pretty good, but sadly not for all users
2008-05-02T03:34:00.000Z	sebsebseb		Matboy: in fact certain users would just be better off with Windows or  a Windows alternative such as ReactOS when it is more mature  http://www.reactos.org
2008-05-02T03:34:00.000Z	^root^	sebsebseb	it is for all users if its for me... i gues...
2008-05-02T03:35:00.000Z	sebsebseb	MatBoy	 yep GNome :)  KDE yuck
2008-05-02T03:35:00.000Z	sebsebseb	MatBoy	well excpet for certain KDE apps for example Konversation and K3B
2008-05-02T03:36:00.000Z	sebsebseb	MatBoy	yes same
2008-05-02T03:37:00.000Z	sebsebseb	MatBoy	in my experience of customziing Gnome it hasn't been quite as good as I wanted it to be,  but  better than KDE still
2008-05-02T03:37:00.000Z	sebsebseb		yep that's true  TeamColtra
2008-05-02T03:39:00.000Z	sebsebseb		TeamColtra:  yep real IT technitan/pro in the making here, and I think a real one should have experience of  various operating systems, and not just Winblows
2008-05-02T03:39:00.000Z	^root^		who told about ReactOS here :P :D, nice thing, just checked, really nice effort for easy migration
2008-05-02T03:39:00.000Z	sebsebseb		that was me root :)
2008-05-02T03:40:00.000Z	^root^	sebsebseb	ahan, nice thing to share, thanks buddy, but i guess i am ubuntu + Virtual Box (with windows XP for games)
2008-05-02T03:40:00.000Z	sebsebseb		the channel for ReactOS is on freenode also by the way
2008-05-02T03:41:00.000Z	^root^	sebsebseb	ahan, i will check that out...
2008-05-02T03:41:00.000Z	^root^	sebsebseb	but reactOs would be for Windows/windows oriented users, for a person like me, i guess we wont migrate...
2008-05-02T03:42:00.000Z	sebsebseb		root no but could be useful to have in a VM or something rather than actsaul Windows when it is more mature
2008-05-02T03:42:00.000Z	^root^	sebsebseb	thats really nice, same is what i am doing, but a little broader level
2008-05-02T03:42:00.000Z	sebsebseb		meaning?
2008-05-02T03:43:00.000Z	^root^	sebsebseb	leading a community promoting Open Source, and migrating people to Linux (that is ofcourse ubuntu)
