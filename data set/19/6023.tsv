2008-03-30T12:51:00.000Z	goob	kelvin911	- synaptic is just a GUI front end for apt
2008-03-30T12:51:00.000Z	goob	kelvin911	- if you want to keep better track of dependencies, i suggest reading up on aptitude
2008-03-30T12:54:00.000Z	goob	kelvin911	- dependencies are files that a program needs in order to run properly - when you use an installer it will link these dependencies for you, but different installers (apt-get vs. aptitude for example) will do it differently  - from what i read aptitude is better with this as well as being a lot smoother on the user
2008-03-30T12:55:00.000Z	goob	kelvin911	- yes and it should come with your distro
2008-03-30T13:02:00.000Z	goob	kelvin911	- how big is your internal drive?
2008-03-30T13:02:00.000Z	goob	kelvin911	- you don't want to cramp things up for virtual memory on the boot drive
2008-03-30T13:03:00.000Z	kelvin911	goob	what do u mean?
2008-03-30T13:03:00.000Z	goob	kelvin911	- lol yeah i wouldn't worry about 4GB then, unless you are running a missile trajectory program lolol
2008-03-30T13:05:00.000Z	goob	kelvin911	- you should be fine with how you have it set up - but you could easily save a couple gigs of space  by resizing you swap partition - if it's worth you time lol
