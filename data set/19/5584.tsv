2008-11-10T00:19:00.000Z	goat|lappy	Chiselhuk_Plus1	gran paradiso was the code name for the beta release
2008-11-10T00:20:00.000Z	Chiselhuk_Plus1	goat|lappy	Thanks for that
2008-11-10T00:20:00.000Z	goat|lappy	Chiselhuk_Plus1	mozilla does that with all their projects, firefox takes the name of parks
2008-11-10T00:20:00.000Z	Chiselhuk_Plus1	goat|lappy	Gutsy
2008-11-10T00:21:00.000Z	Chiselhuk_Plus1	goat|lappy	I have Hardy on disc, but don't know if installing from disc will mean I lose data!
2008-11-10T00:21:00.000Z	goat|lappy	Chiselhuk_Plus1	listen to Flannel's advice :-)
2008-11-10T00:23:00.000Z	Chiselhuk_Plus1	goat|lappy	I fully intend to upgrade, but when I looked in updates for the upgrade there I have to leave my pc alone, so intend to do it overnight!!
2008-11-10T00:23:00.000Z	goat|lappy	Chiselhuk_Plus1	you don't really have to leave it alone
2008-11-10T00:24:00.000Z	goat|lappy	Chiselhuk_Plus1	you just may need to close some apps duringthe upgrade, like firefox
2008-11-10T00:24:00.000Z	Chiselhuk_Plus1	goat|lappy	It said somming about removing so many apps 'n installing others 'n
2008-11-10T00:24:00.000Z	goat|lappy	Chiselhuk_Plus1	thats the point of an upgrade :-)
2008-11-10T00:24:00.000Z	Chiselhuk_Plus1	goat|lappy	But Firefox is my portal to my virtual world!! Mind u I got Epiphany installed too!
2008-11-10T00:25:00.000Z	goat|lappy	Chiselhuk_Plus1	the upgrade process involves a few stages, and there may be prompts for you to select, so doing it overnight may not be the best options
2008-11-10T00:25:00.000Z	goat|lappy		*option
2008-11-10T00:26:00.000Z	Chiselhuk_Plus1	goat|lappy	Thanks for that, I'll start it now, can I leave Konversation open while I do it?
2008-11-10T00:26:00.000Z	goat|lappy	Chiselhuk_Plus1	yes, until you need to reboot
2008-11-10T00:26:00.000Z	Chiselhuk_Plus1	goat|lappy	Reboot in linux, that's unheard of!! LOL
2008-11-10T00:26:00.000Z	goat|lappy	Chiselhuk_Plus1	only when there is a kernel update :-)
2008-11-10T00:27:00.000Z	Chiselhuk_Plus1	goat|lappy	That's acceptable then! Lemme go fire this baby up!
