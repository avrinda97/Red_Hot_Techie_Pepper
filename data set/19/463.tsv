2012-02-10T19:42:00.000Z	webbeast		and made some modifications.........
2012-02-10T19:44:00.000Z	webbeast		I am loading the conky script Dweezahr

2012-02-10T19:46:00.000Z	webbeast		ohh I see cypher-neo
2012-02-10T19:46:00.000Z	webbeast		do you have some simple conky script that I can try?
2012-02-10T19:46:00.000Z	webbeast		and can you tell what is conky.conf file? I dont have it!
2012-02-10T19:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	webbeast	should be ~/.conkyrc
2012-02-10T19:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	webbeast	there are samples online
2012-02-10T19:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	webbeast	find a sample config online and copy it in the ~/.conkyrc file  it will be read and used
2012-02-10T19:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	webbeast	what's good about conky is the file is read in line, so changes apply without restarting the app
2012-02-10T19:51:00.000Z	webbeast	ActionParsnip	cypher-neo I tried this script http://pastebin.com/RUduYKXm and get this error http://pastebin.com/a5wbc5sB
2012-02-10T19:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	webbeast	run:  sudo find /proc | grep -i bat
2012-02-10T19:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	webbeast	not all batery states and such are in the same place, so you need to tweak yours to fit your hardware
2012-02-10T19:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	webbeast	you also need the cpuspeed script the user has.
2012-02-10T19:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	webbeast	there are sample files all over dude
