2009-01-17T07:42:00.000Z	__dean__	Dr_willis	do right click, new folder
2009-01-17T07:42:00.000Z	Dr_willis	__dean__	 its not there in the LIST view..  i will look again for the 10th time. :)
2009-01-17T07:43:00.000Z	__dean__	Dr_willis	File -> Create Folder
2009-01-17T07:43:00.000Z	__dean__	Dr_willis	Or C-N
2009-01-17T07:43:00.000Z	__dean__	Dr_willis	Ctrl-Shift-N
2009-01-17T07:43:00.000Z	Dr_willis	__dean__	  the ISSUE seems to be the right click menu  has to Not be over an icon/item to get that menu..  so you do the right click in the blank spaces in Icon view.. but in List view.. theres no blank spaces.. Or so it seems
2009-01-17T07:45:00.000Z	__dean__	Dr_willis	You can do it in list view if you right click in a blank space
2009-01-17T07:45:00.000Z	__dean__	Dr_willis	but there is only a blank space if there is not many files
2009-01-17T07:45:00.000Z	Dr_willis	__dean__	 what blank space? i right click where it looks like its blank and it select the thing. :) heh  yea...
2009-01-17T07:46:00.000Z	__dean__	Dr_willis	If you go to a folder where there isn't enough files to fill the window, then there will be a blonk space athe bottom where you can right click and it will work
2009-01-17T07:47:00.000Z	Dr_willis	__dean__	 :) sounds like  a  rough edge.  heh
2009-01-17T07:47:00.000Z	__dean__	Dr_willis	But otherwise, you can create a new folder from the File menu or using the keyboard shortcut.
2009-01-17T07:48:00.000Z	Dr_willis	__dean__	 where in the file menu? let me look again there
2009-01-17T07:49:00.000Z	__dean__	Dr_willis	It is below New Tab and New Window
2009-01-17T07:49:00.000Z	__dean__	Dr_willis	and above Create Document
2009-01-17T07:51:00.000Z	Dr_willis	__dean__	 yea. seems some of the entries in the FILE menu could amost go alongside similer items in the EDIT menu..    Ya move to trash in one.. but empty the trash in the other..
2009-01-17T07:52:00.000Z	__dean__		Dr:willis: using the terminal for file manipulation is better
2009-01-17T07:52:00.000Z	__dean__		linkuz3r: you can upgrade to it but it is an alpha
2009-01-17T07:52:00.000Z	Dr_willis	__dean__	 shame! turn in your gnome-merit badge! :P
