2006-07-27T10:08:00.000Z	gatekeeper	prox3h	Dr4g assuming that you have tested the CD (comes with a self test) then I think this might be a hardware issue, I would run badblocks on you hard disk for starters

2006-07-27T10:10:00.000Z	gatekeeper	prox3h	more than enough, smells like a hardware problem
