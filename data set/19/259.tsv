2012-05-18T10:05:00.000Z	glioros		./etc/crontab gives me bash: /etc/crontab: Permission denied
2012-05-18T10:05:00.000Z	glioros		any ideas?
2012-05-18T10:06:00.000Z	crizis	glioros	what you're trying to do?
2012-05-18T10:06:00.000Z	crizis	glioros	"crontab -e" edits the crontab for the user you run it with.. sudo crontab -e for roots crontab
2012-05-18T10:06:00.000Z	crizis	glioros	/etc/crontab isn't an executable file if you're trying to run it, it only lists commands for crontab to run
2012-05-18T10:07:00.000Z	glioros	crizis	basically there was a bug on ubuntu 10.4 and plesk so i mv /etc/init.removed/anacron.conf /etc/init/ so to make the statistics working but nothing
2012-05-18T10:09:00.000Z	glioros	crizis	how to check that cron is working properly ?
2012-05-18T10:10:00.000Z	crizis	glioros	sudo service cron start, should say that it's already running
2012-05-18T10:10:00.000Z	crizis		and whatever it is running, you can edit with crontab -e
2012-05-18T10:11:00.000Z	glioros	crizis	ok it is running. the statistics still not working. many people has problems with statistics on plesk which in installed on ubuntu and PLESK cannot give an answer
2012-05-18T10:12:00.000Z	crizis		well, plesk is a commercial closed panel so they should give support for it
2012-05-18T10:12:00.000Z	crizis		not really an ubuntu issue
2012-05-18T10:13:00.000Z	glioros		i will change host. enough i am tired with them. my advice is stay away from plesk. 10 years i was with cpanel and i never had problems. with plesk i always have problems.
2012-05-18T10:14:00.000Z	crizis	glioros	my friends hosting company runs cpanel, it's far from trouble free too :P ui is also pretty nightmarish...
2012-05-18T10:14:00.000Z	crizis	glioros	i actually developed an easy new ui on top of cpanel's xml api for them :)
2012-05-18T10:14:00.000Z	glioros		what is the name of the company ?
2012-05-18T10:14:00.000Z	crizis		scene group
2012-05-18T10:15:00.000Z	crizis	glioros	http://www.scenegroup.net/hosting_panel that's my work ^^
2012-05-18T10:15:00.000Z	crizis	glioros	classic cpanel available too ofc ^^
