2005-06-18T12:32:00.000Z	ksoze		I had a strange thing happen.  the add/remove programs util asked for a password, and the root password didn't work, but my user password did
2005-06-18T12:32:00.000Z	ksoze		ahhhh
2005-06-18T12:32:00.000Z	ksoze		cool
2005-06-18T12:33:00.000Z	ksoze		it is?
2005-06-18T12:33:00.000Z	ksoze		so what is the root pwd for, then?
2005-06-18T12:33:00.000Z	ksoze		I mean, the once with the root account
2005-06-18T12:33:00.000Z	ksoze		the one, rather
2005-06-18T12:35:00.000Z	ksoze		I read the article you pointed to, but I'm not sure why root had to be nuked.  I like the use of sudo, but can't it be handy sometimes to have good ol' root?
2005-06-18T12:37:00.000Z	ksoze		things might break with an enabled root?
2005-06-18T12:38:00.000Z	ksoze		so is audacity nicely packaged for easy install?
2005-06-18T12:39:00.000Z	synd	ksoze	as most things are
2005-06-18T12:41:00.000Z	ksoze	synd	as I see now.  ardour and audacity are both there

2005-06-18T13:52:00.000Z	synd	ksoze	what were you complaining for about esd?
2005-06-18T13:52:00.000Z	ksoze	synd	that audacity doesn't work with it
