2012-04-27T18:37:00.000Z	mystblade9		Is the problem where the liveCD hangs at boot because you have an nVidia card fixed yet?
2012-04-27T18:39:00.000Z	violinappren	mystblade9	press shift
2012-04-27T18:40:00.000Z	mystblade9	violinappren	Holding shift while booting the LiveCD takes me to GRUB?
2012-04-27T18:40:00.000Z	violinappren	mystblade9	takes you to a screen where you can edit the kernel parameters or select a different "mode" for booting ubuntu
2012-04-27T18:41:00.000Z	mystblade9	violinappren	Thanks, i'll try that :)
2012-04-27T23:19:00.000Z	violinappren	mystblade9	trying removing 'quiet splash' from the boot line and see what messages it will emit
2012-04-27T23:20:00.000Z	mystblade9	violinappren	The LiveCD doesn't use GRUB.. It's some kind of weird command line now, I think it's LILO.
2012-04-27T23:20:00.000Z	violinappren	mystblade9	regardless
2012-04-27T23:20:00.000Z	mystblade9	violinappren	It doesn't allow me to remove sections of the kernel line.. all it allows me to do is type 'live' or 'live-install' and the arguments I would like to add.
2012-04-27T23:21:00.000Z	violinappren	mystblade9	it's syslinux not grub, and it does allow to cutomize the bootline
2012-04-27T23:21:00.000Z	mystblade9	violinappren	how?
2012-04-27T23:21:00.000Z	mystblade9	violinappren	Anyway, when I type that line it doesn't even boot into anything.. It just hangs at the newline after 'livecd nomodeset'
2012-04-27T23:22:00.000Z	violinappren	mystblade9	 some advanced/custom mode, dont have a live cd at hand now to try
2012-04-27T23:22:00.000Z	violinappren	mystblade9	you need to find out exactly why the boot hangs by enable boot messages
2012-04-27T23:24:00.000Z	mystblade9	violinappren	I'll try burning the CD agsin, I think the ISO i am using is corrupted.
2012-04-27T23:25:00.000Z	mystblade9	violinappren	Hmm. The ISO isn't corrupt, just verified it using the checksum.
2012-04-27T23:26:00.000Z	violinappren	mystblade9	im downloading an iso, give me 10 min and i will tell exactly how to enable boot messages
2012-04-27T23:31:00.000Z	violinappren	mystblade9	press f6 then escape, then you can move cursor and press backspace to delete quiet and splash
2012-04-27T23:32:00.000Z	mystblade9	violinappren	alright, thanks :)
