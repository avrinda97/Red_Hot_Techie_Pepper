2007-03-14T15:12:00.000Z	Knight_Lord	cchance	what do you mean by locking the settings?
2007-03-14T15:12:00.000Z	Knight_Lord	cchance	I don't think you can restrict which port firefox accesses pages at
2007-03-14T15:12:00.000Z	Knight_Lord	cchance	the syntax URL:port should always work
2007-03-14T15:13:00.000Z	Knight_Lord	cchance	you can block at the firewall level though
2007-03-14T15:13:00.000Z	Knight_Lord	cchance	what are you trying to do?
2007-03-14T15:14:00.000Z	Knight_Lord	cchance	why don't you firewall the rest then?
2007-03-14T15:14:00.000Z	Knight_Lord	cchance	if you block firefox they will use konqueror
2007-03-14T15:14:00.000Z	Knight_Lord	cchance	and then opera, and then lynx
2007-03-14T15:14:00.000Z	Knight_Lord	cchance	and so on
2007-03-14T15:15:00.000Z	Knight_Lord	cchance	so the other accounts don't have shell access?
2007-03-14T15:15:00.000Z	Knight_Lord	cchance	I have doubts it's possible to do that
2007-03-14T15:15:00.000Z	Knight_Lord	cchance	I would certainly not rely on it
2007-03-14T15:16:00.000Z	Knight_Lord	cchance	try installing IP tables
2007-03-14T15:16:00.000Z	Knight_Lord	cchance	and build a nice firewall with fwbuilder
2007-03-14T15:16:00.000Z	Knight_Lord	cchance	it's quite easy to use
2007-03-14T15:16:00.000Z	Knight_Lord	cchance	and works great
2007-03-14T15:16:00.000Z	Knight_Lord	cchance	why is that?
