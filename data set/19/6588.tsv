2008-08-04T07:20:00.000Z	Flannel	DINKDINK	they'll show up as /dev/sdX
2008-08-04T07:21:00.000Z	Flannel	DINKDINK	with a number after that for partitions (some of those will be internal drives, etc)
2008-08-04T07:21:00.000Z	DINKDINK		Flannel where though?
2008-08-04T07:21:00.000Z	Flannel	DINKDINK	inside of /dev/
2008-08-04T07:22:00.000Z	DINKDINK	Flannel	when I ls /dev/ I just get a list of every possible device not the ones connected to my computer
2008-08-04T07:22:00.000Z	Flannel	DINKDINK	Not quite.  You only get devices that exist.  Try this though: ls dev | grep sd
2008-08-04T07:23:00.000Z	DINKDINK	Flannel	that gives me a list of like 30 devices
2008-08-04T07:23:00.000Z	Flannel	DINKDINK	Are they sd*? or is the sd just somewhere in them?
2008-08-04T07:24:00.000Z	DINKDINK		most are sd*
2008-08-04T07:24:00.000Z	DINKDINK	Flannel	most are sd*
2008-08-04T07:25:00.000Z	DINKDINK	Flannel	I only have one hard drive connect and one external usb drive, trying to figure our the device name for the usb (trying to recover data from it, I murdered it today)
2008-08-04T07:25:00.000Z	DINKDINK		Flannel yet I have like over 30 sd* devices
2008-08-04T07:25:00.000Z	Flannel	DINKDINK	everything that is sd* (sda, sdb, etc) is a drive.  Everything that is sdx* (sda1 sda2, etc) is a partition on the drive.
2008-08-04T07:26:00.000Z	DINKDINK	Flannel	well I have like sdg 1-15, sda 1-15, sdf 1-15 all listed
2008-08-04T07:27:00.000Z	DINKDINK		sdh 1-15 so on and so on
2008-08-04T07:28:00.000Z	Flannel	DINKDINK	try sudo fdisk -l
2008-08-04T07:29:00.000Z	DINKDINK	Flannel	that's what I was trying to remember
