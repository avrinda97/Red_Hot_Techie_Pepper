2007-03-06T17:41:00.000Z	Kisom	Msword	Probaby, but a regular network connection is way easier.

2007-03-06T17:41:00.000Z	Msword	Kisom	i'm lazy and don't want to fix it :)

2007-03-06T17:42:00.000Z	Kisom	Msword	Don't you have a regular twister pair cable?
2007-03-06T17:42:00.000Z	Msword	Kisom	what?
2007-03-06T17:42:00.000Z	Kisom	Msword	Regular network-cable...
2007-03-06T17:42:00.000Z	Msword	Kisom	nope, i got me a usb though lol
2007-03-06T17:43:00.000Z	Msword	Kisom	how would i go about backing up everything on the hard drive?
2007-03-06T17:43:00.000Z	Kisom	Msword	Well, either fix your WiFi or get an external drive then. And 30 GiB over WiFi... Well, I wouldn't do ut.
2007-03-06T17:43:00.000Z	Kisom	Msword	I would just put it onto another drive.
2007-03-06T17:44:00.000Z	Msword	Kisom	i'm gonna go buy a external hd then, how would i go about backing up the whole thing, not just individual files?
