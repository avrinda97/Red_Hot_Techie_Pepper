2006-03-09T17:33:00.000Z	_0331_USMC		where is SWAT for Samba located in Ubuntu?  Or how do I find where it is?
2006-03-09T06:03:00.000Z	_0331_USMC		can anyone help me get samba and SWAT working?
2006-03-09T06:03:00.000Z	diogo	_0331_USMC	what exactly do you want to do?
2006-03-09T06:04:00.000Z	_0331_USMC	diogo	I want to share files between my laptop (ubuntu), my ubuntu box, and both of my windows xp boxes
2006-03-09T06:05:00.000Z	diogo	_0331_USMC	start with something simple like "sudo aptitude install samba". ;o)
2006-03-09T06:06:00.000Z	diogo	_0331_USMC	swat is also a valid package that you can install with aptitude/synaptic/apt-get
2006-03-09T06:07:00.000Z	_0331_USMC	diogo	got that too.  just can't figure out how to get SWAT to open up and let me start configuring my samba server
2006-03-09T06:07:00.000Z	diogo	_0331_USMC	hmmm, just a second...
2006-03-09T06:08:00.000Z	diogo	_0331_USMC	Try accessing http://localhost:901/ on your web browser, please.
2006-03-09T06:08:00.000Z	_0331_USMC	diogo	can't establish connection
2006-03-09T06:09:00.000Z	diogo	_0331_USMC	Do you know if swat is started? I'm not sure if it runs as a daemon... Try "sudo ps xa | grep swat", please.
2006-03-09T06:12:00.000Z	diogo	_0331_USMC	Ok, now please check if you can do something like "sudo invoke-rc.d swat start"
2006-03-09T06:13:00.000Z	_0331_USMC	diogo	 invoke-rc.d: unknown initscript, /etc/init.d/swat not found.
2006-03-09T06:17:00.000Z	diogo	_0331_USMC	I'm sorry but I can't figure out what's going on with your swat installation... But what do you think about webmin-samba? :o)
2006-03-09T06:17:00.000Z	_0331_USMC	diogo	I want to do whatever i have to in order to get samba working
2006-03-09T06:19:00.000Z	diogo	_0331_USMC	Ok, I've just found something called "Shared Folders" under "System" / "Settings"
2006-03-09T06:19:00.000Z	diogo	_0331_USMC	I believe it can manage Samba for you.
2006-03-09T06:20:00.000Z	_0331_USMC	diogo	want to pm me?  It will be easer to read what eachother is saying
2006-03-09T06:21:00.000Z	diogo	_0331_USMC	Sure, no problem!
