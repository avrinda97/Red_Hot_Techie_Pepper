2005-03-04T08:23:00.000Z	universal		can someone tell me how to write root in gnome?
2005-03-04T08:24:00.000Z	Amaranth	universal	gksudo is what pops up the little dialog to type in your password for a GUI app
2005-03-04T08:25:00.000Z	Amaranth	universal	So instead of a shortcut running, say, k3b you have it run gksudo k3b
2005-03-04T08:26:00.000Z	universal	Amaranth	so i can actually write fx write gksudo Point2Play if i whant?
2005-03-04T08:27:00.000Z	universal	Amaranth	exactly, and as you say i also need to be gksudo when running K3B
2005-03-04T08:29:00.000Z	Amaranth	universal	So make the shortcut run gksudo Point2Play
2005-03-04T08:30:00.000Z	universal	Amaranth	yeah, it works, but what about if i whant to stop gnome popping up with "write password" screen?
2005-03-04T08:30:00.000Z	Amaranth	universal	It'll only do it once per login session (maybe per app too)
2005-03-04T08:30:00.000Z	Amaranth	universal	But you have to put in your password at least once.
2005-03-04T08:31:00.000Z	universal	Amaranth	yeah, is see, cool
2005-03-04T08:34:00.000Z	universal	Amaranth	hey, do you know if there is a performance-difference between using a nvidia driver downloaded from nvidia.com, or the driver from apt-get install nvidia-glx?
2005-03-04T08:35:00.000Z	universal	Amaranth	but it seems that my Counterstrike source doesent work optimal with cedega?
2005-03-04T08:36:00.000Z	Amaranth	universal	That's probably cedega, not the video card.
2005-03-04T08:37:00.000Z	universal	Amaranth	ok, but dont you think that something could be configurated so my graphic-card can make it?
2005-03-04T08:38:00.000Z	Amaranth	universal	Dunno for sure. I don't use cedega and my gfx card is an ATI that is supported (full 3D) but an open source driver. :)
2005-03-04T08:38:00.000Z	universal	Amaranth	ok, fine, ill catch you later.... ;)
2005-03-25T12:03:00.000Z	universal	Amaranth	do you know about gdesklets?
2005-03-25T12:03:00.000Z	Amaranth	universal	Nope.
2005-03-25T12:03:00.000Z	universal	Amaranth	ok
