2006-11-16T10:44:00.000Z	Axidus		yes it is but there is no support that I know about

2006-11-16T10:48:00.000Z	Axidus		natty so what's an easy terminal way of doing it
2006-11-16T10:49:00.000Z	Axidus		will updating to edgy do it?
2006-11-16T10:49:00.000Z	eternalswd	Axidus	edgy uses kernel version 2.6.17
2006-11-16T10:50:00.000Z	Axidus	eternalswd	so edgy is also behind ?
2006-11-16T10:50:00.000Z	eternalswd	Axidus	it takes a while for a kernel release to make it to the repository.
2006-11-16T10:51:00.000Z	Axidus	eternalswd	so what does a kernel have to do with hardware printer support?
2006-11-16T10:52:00.000Z	eternalswd	Axidus	as driver support is added or updated, they update with the kernel, probably labeled as kernel modules in synaptic.
2006-11-16T10:54:00.000Z	eternalswd	Axidus	maybe set it up as a network printer and run windows on a virtual machine?
2006-11-16T10:56:00.000Z	eternalswd	Axidus	2 minutes until it finishes downloading or installing?  It took my computer about half an hour to actually install.
2006-11-16T10:56:00.000Z	Axidus	eternalswd	installing
2006-11-16T10:59:00.000Z	eternalswd	Axidus	try using the driver for the compatible lexmark.  http://downloads.lexmark.com/cgi-perl/downloads.cgi?ccs=229:1:0:463:0:0&searchLang=en&os_group=Redhat&target=
