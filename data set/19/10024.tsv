2006-08-09T11:11:00.000Z	majorMatarrese	vedder	how much RAM do you have?
2006-08-09T11:12:00.000Z	majorMatarrese	vedder	it sounds like you just should buy more, like a gig
2006-08-09T11:13:00.000Z	majorMatarrese	vedder	I think ubuntu is one of the more RAM eating distros
2006-08-09T11:13:00.000Z	majorMatarrese	vedder	you could try Xubuntu which gets rid of most of what's in the system tray
2006-08-09T11:21:00.000Z	majorMatarrese	vedder	I assume you mean java?
2006-08-09T11:22:00.000Z	majorMatarrese	vedder	Applet meaning like a startup item in windows or OS X?
2006-08-09T11:30:00.000Z	majorMatarrese	vedder	I don't see a way to disable startup items
2006-08-09T11:30:00.000Z	majorMatarrese	vedder	which is what I assume you
2006-08-09T11:31:00.000Z	majorMatarrese	vedder	!bum
2006-08-09T11:32:00.000Z	majorMatarrese	vedder	you can use  update-rc.d
