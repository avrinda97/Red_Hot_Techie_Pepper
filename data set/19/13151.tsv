2005-11-26T11:59:00.000Z	Razor-X	clint-	yeahp?
2005-11-26T12:06:00.000Z	Razor-X	clint-	what seems to be the problem?
2005-11-26T12:09:00.000Z	Razor-X	clint-	you can try picking another keyboard layout
2005-11-26T12:09:00.000Z	Razor-X	clint-	or if need be, make one yourself
2005-11-26T12:10:00.000Z	Razor-X	clint-	:), well I setup both here pretty quickly
2005-11-26T12:10:00.000Z	Razor-X	clint-	but I did sweat and bleed too
2005-11-26T12:15:00.000Z	Razor-X	clint-	have you tried making a custom keyboard layout?
2005-11-26T12:17:00.000Z	Razor-X	clint-	I like Ubuntu a lot, but if Ubuntu refuses to work, then I guess the Debian ship is best
2005-11-26T12:17:00.000Z	Razor-X	clint-	but refusing to work by my standards means that BASH is segfaulting
2005-11-26T12:25:00.000Z	Razor-X	clint-	I do :P
