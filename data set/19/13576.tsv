2005-03-03T11:41:00.000Z	yccheok		had anyone switch from fedora family to ubuntu before?
2005-03-03T11:41:00.000Z	apokryphos	yccheok	Yup; me.
2005-03-03T11:42:00.000Z	apokryphos	yccheok	I found Ubuntu faster, and has far better apt sources because of the Debian backbone. I prefer Ubuntu, easily.
2005-03-03T11:43:00.000Z	yccheok	apokryphos	oh! i thought most of the app are distributed in rpm package? that's why till now, i hvnt try on ubuntu
2005-03-03T11:43:00.000Z	apokryphos	yccheok	In Ubuntu, nope, though it can handle RPMs.
2005-03-03T11:44:00.000Z	yccheok	apokryphos	so far, did u find any packages which u can install in fedora, but not in ubuntu?
2005-03-03T11:45:00.000Z	apokryphos	yccheok	Nope. Ubuntu repos are easily larger. Even better repos for KDE apps on Ubuntu, as far as I can see.
2005-03-03T11:46:00.000Z	apokryphos	yccheok	Also, the other plus is of course that you only ever have to install the Distro once, and all upgrades are done through apt. :)
2005-03-03T11:46:00.000Z	yccheok	apokryphos	oh, i thought yum also have the capability to do tat :)
2005-03-03T11:47:00.000Z	yccheok	apokryphos	i cannt wait to try out ubuntu coz i had bitten several time of my fedora hang :(
2005-03-03T11:47:00.000Z	apokryphos	yccheok	Heh, that would surprise me, but I'm sure it might be the case.
2005-03-03T11:47:00.000Z	apokryphos	yccheok	It's very easy to get started on Ubuntu, which is of course a very good thing. Once you've installed it see Ubuntuguide.org for all configuration etc.
2005-03-03T11:48:00.000Z	yccheok	apokryphos	i will try it out once i get a new hard disk or i can experimented in my gf computer ;)
2005-03-03T11:48:00.000Z	apokryphos	yccheok	Good luck. :)
2005-03-03T11:48:00.000Z	yccheok	apokryphos	i have several projects nw in fedora, that's why i still wont try it yet :D
2005-03-03T11:49:00.000Z	yccheok	apokryphos	hw about the hardware support? last time i had try a long time to make my 3D card works in fedora
2005-03-03T11:49:00.000Z	apokryphos	yccheok	Funnily enough, I found it real easy in Fedora. There's step-by-step on the guide.
2005-03-03T11:49:00.000Z	apokryphos	yccheok	*Ubuntu
2005-03-03T11:50:00.000Z	apokryphos	yccheok	In FC3 it was a hassle for me; had to manually download the nvidia drivers from the site, then go in failsafe etc.
