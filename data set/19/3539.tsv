2009-07-22T19:59:00.000Z	ikonia	ik00R	set it in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2009-07-22T19:59:00.000Z	ik00R	ikonia	i dunno how, it just says default and stuff
2009-07-22T20:00:00.000Z	ikonia	ik00R	why are you not running the desktop version
2009-07-22T20:00:00.000Z	ikonia	ik00R	the desktop version is an excellent server, more so if you need X
2009-07-22T20:00:00.000Z	ikonia	ik00R	it also has a better configuration out of the box
2009-07-22T20:01:00.000Z	ikonia	ik00R	how will using a server install teach you more or less about linux than the desktop
2009-07-22T20:01:00.000Z	ikonia	ik00R	they are the same core OS
2009-07-22T20:01:00.000Z	ikonia	ik00R	the desktop install is better suited to desktop hardware
2009-07-22T20:04:00.000Z	ikonia	ik00R	it is
2009-07-22T20:04:00.000Z	ik00R	ikonia	why the just diss me cause i ask how to chage resolution on X on a server?
2009-07-22T20:04:00.000Z	ikonia	ik00R	I'm just advising you that the the desktop environment may be a better learning environment
2009-07-22T20:04:00.000Z	ikonia	ik00R	I'm not moking you, everyone starts somewheree
2009-07-22T20:05:00.000Z	ik00R	ikonia	i am on desktop
