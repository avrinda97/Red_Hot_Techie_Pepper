2010-11-19T03:48:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Snobfrog	you could see the VBox instructions for working with physical partitions at http://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch09.html#rawdisk BUT notice the big warning in red (also I've never tried this!)
2010-11-19T03:54:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Snobfrog	vw what's that?  "just want to split my h.d." well the installer default to installing "side by side" which is a separate partition for windows and linux.  don't understand your WinXP question at all i'm affraid.
2010-11-19T03:59:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Snobfrog	typing zykoticK9 is a pain - using <Z><y><TAB> is SO much easier.
2010-11-19T04:00:00.000Z	Snobfrog	ZykoticK9	 my cd drive is broken, have no usb stick and thats why i cannot boot from win xp disk to install xp. what i am asking is can i install xp by double clicking while the ubuntu is running. im sorry for my blurry explanation, also thx for the advice
2010-11-19T04:01:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Snobfrog	sorry that is a windows issue for sure, you could try ##windows - i have NO idea how you could launch Windows Installer from inside Linux - i highly doubt wine will work.
2010-11-19T04:03:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Snobfrog	upon thinking about it - wine will not work for a physical install.  Good luck man.
2010-11-19T04:03:00.000Z	Snobfrog	ZykoticK9	lovely : ) dont treat me like this just started to adore linux  after 7 years
2010-11-19T04:03:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Snobfrog	not a linux issue.  good luck.
2010-11-19T04:04:00.000Z	Snobfrog	ZykoticK9	 thanks dude
