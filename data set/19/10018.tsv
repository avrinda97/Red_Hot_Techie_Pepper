2006-08-10T13:27:00.000Z	anolis		Hello, I'm seeking help regarding monitor resolutions
2006-08-10T13:27:00.000Z	anolis		my computer used to run fine at 1280x1024, but a 3d app changed my resolution, I tried to change it back unsuccesfully.  and now I can only get a maximum res of 1024x768
2006-08-10T13:28:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	anolis	what app did you run?
2006-08-10T13:29:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	anolis	have you tried cycling through the resolutions? ctrl+alt numpad+ and numpad- will cycle res.
2006-08-10T13:30:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	anolis	add your resolution to it then.
2006-08-10T13:31:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	anolis	you said that you had it working before at that res?
2006-08-10T13:31:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	anolis	is it a lcd or a crt?
2006-08-10T13:31:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	anolis	look it up on the web. refresh rates are not something you should gess.
2006-08-10T13:33:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	anolis	I guess the easiest way for you would be to run sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg and enter them there, especially if you are not comfortable editing xorg.conf by hand.
2006-08-10T13:44:00.000Z	anolis	fyrestrtr	what should i do now
2006-08-10T13:44:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	anolis	??
2006-08-10T13:45:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	anolis	did you restart X?
2006-08-10T13:46:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	anolis	pastebin your xorg.conf
2006-08-10T14:04:00.000Z	anolis	fyrestrtr	http://3463.pastebin.com/766648
