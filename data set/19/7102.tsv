2007-10-13T12:54:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	L0GAN	sorry, it's a popular distro   : )
2007-10-13T12:56:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	L0GAN	what do you mean "tried" ?   you can't boot the Ubuntu LiveCD?
2007-10-13T12:56:00.000Z	L0GAN	FunnyLookinHat	 i can but cant use persistent to save settings to usb stick
2007-10-13T12:57:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	L0GAN	Yeah, booting from USB can be difficult.  And likely impossible unless you're an advanced user.
2007-10-13T12:58:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	L0GAN	You should either just install it if you can, or not bother trying to work off the live cd
2007-10-13T12:58:00.000Z	L0GAN	FunnyLookinHat	 hmm I try restarting and entering usb instead of persistent
2007-10-13T12:58:00.000Z	L0GAN	FunnyLookinHat	 thanks for the help
2007-10-13T12:58:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	L0GAN	n/p   sorry I couldn't be of more help
2007-10-13T12:59:00.000Z	L0GAN	FunnyLookinHat	maybe documentation is out of date or it just wont work for me lol
