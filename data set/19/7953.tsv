2007-10-19T07:14:00.000Z	juanbond		I just did a fresh install of Gusty and I am trying to install my ATI restricted driver and I keep on getting "Could not apply changes! Fix broken packages first."  What do I need to do in order to install the driver?
2007-10-19T07:14:00.000Z	mrj	juanbond	in synaptic click the Broken filter
2007-10-19T07:14:00.000Z	mrj	juanbond	find out whats broken and proceed from there (remove it or reinstall)
2007-10-19T07:15:00.000Z	mrj	juanbond	i just said, in synaptic use the broken filter it will tell you exactly which one is broken
2007-10-19T07:16:00.000Z	mrj	juanbond	run the command it tells you to run when it says theres a broken package. it should be something like sudo apt-get install -f
2007-10-19T07:18:00.000Z	juanbond	mrj	when I do sudo apt-get install -f,  it's not telling me anything about broken packages.  it says 0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
2007-10-19T07:20:00.000Z	juanbond	mrj	when I do sudo apt-get install -f,  it's not telling me anything about broken packages.  it says 0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
2007-10-19T07:21:00.000Z	mrj	juanbond	the last few lines of the command don't say anything about broken?
2007-10-19T07:21:00.000Z	mrj	juanbond	run sudo apt-get update
2007-10-19T07:22:00.000Z	juanbond	mrj	updating, but i've already rebuilt my package list too.
2007-10-19T07:32:00.000Z	juanbond	mrj	when I tried sudo apt-get install xorg-driver-fglrx, I got the message: The following packages have unmet dependencies: xorg-driver-fglrx: Depends: libstdc++5 (>= 1:3.3.4-1) but is not installable... E: Broken packages.
2007-10-19T07:33:00.000Z	mrj	juanbond	see if libstdc++5 is installed in synaptic, maybe reinstall it
2007-10-19T07:35:00.000Z	juanbond	mrj	synaptic is telling me libstdc++6 is install, i don't see a 5 though.
2007-10-19T07:39:00.000Z	juanbond	mrj	synaptic is telling me libstdc++6 is install, i don't see a 5 though.
2007-10-19T07:39:00.000Z	mrj	juanbond	do a google on installing libstdc++5 you can probably find the link
2007-10-19T07:40:00.000Z	mrj	juanbond	it's probably out of the repository because its been replace with a newer one
2007-10-19T07:41:00.000Z	juanbond	mrj	so the fglrx driver needs to be updated to use libstdc++6 and not libstdc++5?
2007-10-19T07:42:00.000Z	mrj	juanbond	no idea honestly
2007-10-19T08:08:00.000Z	juanbond	mrj	you still around ???
