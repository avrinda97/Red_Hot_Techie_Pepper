2008-03-11T14:54:00.000Z	Dolf		hey people. I am trying to install Windows Xp next to my Ubuntu install. The ubuntu isntall is on /dev/sda1 and I would like to install windows on /dev/sdb1
2008-03-11T14:55:00.000Z	Dolf		the problem is that windows does not want to be installed on the primary slave drive
2008-03-11T14:55:00.000Z	Dolf		So I want to start the windows CD through grub so I can map hd0 to hd1 and hd1 to hd0
2008-03-11T14:55:00.000Z	pajamian	Dolf	windows is pretty picky that way, when you do get it to install it will overwrite the mbr and mess up your linux boot too.
2008-03-11T14:55:00.000Z	Dolf		that way the windows install cd thinks it is being installed on the primary disk
2008-03-11T14:55:00.000Z	Dolf	pajamian	I know
2008-03-11T14:56:00.000Z	Dolf		I can reinstall Grub in the MBR
2008-03-11T14:56:00.000Z	Dolf		that doesn't matter
2008-03-11T14:56:00.000Z	Dolf		The thing is I have to put an entry inGRUB telling it to start from the Windows CD
2008-03-11T14:56:00.000Z	pajamian	Dolf	I would pull out the linux drive, make the windows drive hda and install windows, then put it back and do the grub mapping thing.  I can't say for sure it will work, though.
2008-03-11T14:56:00.000Z	Dolf		pajamian:
2008-03-11T14:56:00.000Z	Dolf		that is a good ide
2008-03-11T14:56:00.000Z	Dolf		*idea
2008-03-11T14:56:00.000Z	Dolf		I' ll do that
2008-03-11T14:57:00.000Z	Dolf		then I can map the hd' s in grub after the install was succesfull
2008-03-11T14:57:00.000Z	Dolf		let' s try
2008-03-11T14:57:00.000Z	pajamian	Dolf	yeah, that's what I would figure and since the linux drive won't be in the box when you isntall windows it can't possibly be messed up.
2008-03-11T14:57:00.000Z	Dolf		that's true
2008-03-11T14:58:00.000Z	pajamian	Dolf	good luck
