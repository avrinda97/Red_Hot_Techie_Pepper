2005-06-11T09:51:00.000Z	dooglus	david__	right-click the desktop and select 'create launcher'
2005-06-11T09:52:00.000Z	david__	dooglus	anto9us but in that i must be doing something wrong
2005-06-11T09:54:00.000Z	dooglus	david__	the problem is that it needs a password
2005-06-11T09:55:00.000Z	dooglus	david__	if you have run 'sudo' in the last 5 minutes and typed your password, it won't ask for the password again.
2005-06-11T09:55:00.000Z	dooglus	david__	that's why it works on one pc and not the other
2005-06-11T09:55:00.000Z	david__	dooglus	i'll try it on the other comp ty
2005-06-11T09:55:00.000Z	dooglus	david__	run "sudo date" in a terminal, put in the password, then try the icon...
2005-06-11T09:57:00.000Z	david__	dooglus	this is really weird
2005-06-11T09:57:00.000Z	dooglus	david__	I maybe have been wrong above, sorry...
2005-06-11T09:57:00.000Z	david__	dooglus	i just went up and made the thing again
2005-06-11T09:57:00.000Z	david__	dooglus	on my bros comp and it worked
2005-06-11T09:57:00.000Z	dooglus	david__	but anyway, the solution is to use "gksudo nautilus" instead of "sudo nautilus"
2005-06-11T09:57:00.000Z	david__	dooglus	no idea why it din'dt work before
2005-06-11T09:57:00.000Z	david__	dooglus	k
2005-06-11T09:58:00.000Z	david__	dooglus	do you know how to make it default to the main filesystem instad of that folder it goes to?
2005-06-11T09:59:00.000Z	dooglus	david__	what do you mean?
2005-06-11T10:18:00.000Z	david__	dooglus	remember how i was having that prob with nautilus? i just rebooted my comp and its' bugged up again
2005-06-11T10:18:00.000Z	david__	dooglus	you said add gksudo instead of sudo?
