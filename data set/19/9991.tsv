2007-01-08T15:28:00.000Z	DARKGuy		Holy.... cow. Beryl friggen' rocks. Too bad it doesn't work with FluxBox :( anybody know a VERY lightweight and fast non-WM thing? (not like XFCE, but are there others?)
2007-01-08T15:29:00.000Z	mdious	DARKGuy	 I like blackbox...there is like openbox, fvwm etc...a google search for linux lightweight window managers brings up some stuff you might like
2007-01-08T15:30:00.000Z	DARKGuy	mdious	but it is said that any box WMs don't work with Beryl since Beryl is a WM itself :/
2007-01-08T15:31:00.000Z	mdious	DARKGuy	 sorry I didn't read what you said properly
2007-01-08T15:31:00.000Z	DARKGuy	mdious	It's okay ^_^ thanks for answering though
2007-05-24T10:28:00.000Z	mdious	DARKGuy	 ubuntu makes home folders world readable by default (as far as I know) so you will have to change the permissions on it appropriately
2007-05-24T10:28:00.000Z	DARKGuy	mdious	yes, and that's what I want to avoid in this case :P do you know what are the permissions I'll need to set?
2007-05-24T10:30:00.000Z	mdious	DARKGuy	 sorry for giving wrong info
2007-05-24T10:30:00.000Z	DARKGuy	mdious	that's ok :) we're humans after all xD
2007-05-24T10:39:00.000Z	mdious	DARKGuy	 chmod -R 750 /home/your_user_name will take it off for everyone else...(depending on your group)...but might want to check the specific folders
2007-05-24T10:41:00.000Z	DARKGuy	mdious	huh, guess I'll put my stuff in a folder and chmod it o.o
2007-05-24T10:41:00.000Z	mdious	DARKGuy	 Just do it on the root of you rhome folderand that should help you out
2007-05-24T10:41:00.000Z	DARKGuy	mdious	but wouldn't that screw up the chmod of other folders o.O?
2007-05-24T10:42:00.000Z	mdious	DARKGuy	 I just did a test then, just take the world read off your /home/username folder
2007-05-24T10:42:00.000Z	mdious	DARKGuy	 don't do a recursive, just chmod on the /home/username folder
2007-05-24T10:44:00.000Z	DARKGuy	mdious	mkay, I'll try... thanks :p
2007-05-24T10:45:00.000Z	mdious	DARKGuy	 no worries i hope I have not trashed your system :P
2007-05-24T10:51:00.000Z	DARKGuy	mdious	it worked perfectly, thanks for the help mdious & klobster ^^
2007-05-24T10:51:00.000Z	mdious	DARKGuy	 good to hear, hope it continues working :)
