2010-02-05T14:32:00.000Z	nigel_nb	meowbuntu	I dont think there is anything in particular you have to do.  just create it.  Not much of settings to tweak
2010-02-05T14:33:00.000Z	meowbuntu	nigel_nb	i meaning eg formating to ext4 or ntfs etc do i need to do that
2010-02-05T14:34:00.000Z	nigel_nb	meowbuntu	the application will do it for you

2010-02-05T14:56:00.000Z	nigel_nb	meowbuntu	per se downloading from youtube is not illegal
