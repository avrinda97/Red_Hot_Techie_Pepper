2006-11-12T08:53:00.000Z	LjL	superkirbyartist	i don't know. try OpenOffice Impress for that perhaps
2006-11-12T08:53:00.000Z	LjL	superkirbyartist	disregard the first message, i mixed up "alternatives" and "equivalents"
2006-11-12T08:56:00.000Z	LjL	superkirbyartist	you don't. but on the bright side, ext3 suffers from fragmentation much less than FAT and NTFS do
2006-11-12T08:56:00.000Z	LjL	superkirbyartist	not necessarily, but Ubuntu does by default
2006-11-15T07:30:00.000Z	LjL	superkirbyartist	#ubuntu-xgl is the channel you want
2006-12-19T07:13:00.000Z	LjL	superkirbyartist	the xubuntu one should load... if it still doesn't, "apt-get --reinstall install" it
2007-10-03T15:46:00.000Z	LjL	superkirbyartist	...?
2007-10-03T15:47:00.000Z	LjL	superkirbyartist	why would he want recovery mode?
2007-10-03T15:47:00.000Z	superkirbyartist	LjL	If NVIDIA won't boot, he can't see anything on the screen.
2007-10-03T15:48:00.000Z	superkirbyartist	LjL	He can install/remove NVIDIA stuff from recovery mode.
2007-10-03T15:48:00.000Z	superkirbyartist	LjL	recovery mode linux = windows safe mode.
2007-10-03T15:48:00.000Z	LjL	superkirbyartist	uhm, he can see a terminal and use it - just like he can from recovery mode. and if nvidia doesn't work in normal mode, i don't see how 'startx' would work in recovery mode
2007-10-03T15:48:00.000Z	LjL	superkirbyartist	not really
2007-10-03T15:54:00.000Z	superkirbyartist	LjL	sudo apt-get remove apt
2007-10-03T15:54:00.000Z	LjL	superkirbyartist	don't give such dangerous commands in the channel please
2007-10-03T15:55:00.000Z	superkirbyartist	LjL	sorry.
