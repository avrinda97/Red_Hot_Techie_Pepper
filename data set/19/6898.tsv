2008-10-27T05:10:00.000Z	sleven		-rw-r--r-- l
2008-10-27T05:10:00.000Z	sleven		-rw-r--r-- l user 312
2008-10-27T05:10:00.000Z	sleven		so how do I?
2008-10-27T05:10:00.000Z	sleven		ah it worked, thanks!
2008-10-27T05:11:00.000Z	sleven		now do i have to do that spearately for each file or can i do it fo the whole dir?
2008-10-27T05:11:00.000Z	sleven		chmod +x /usr../* makes all executable?
2008-10-27T05:12:00.000Z	sleven		k thanks
2008-10-27T05:12:00.000Z	yoyoned	sleven	chmod +x /usr../* could be dangerous.  onlu chmod the files you move there
2008-10-27T05:12:00.000Z	sleven	yoyoned	k
2008-10-27T05:13:00.000Z	sleven	yoyoned	why is it dangerous anyway, could open a whole into my computer?
2008-10-27T05:14:00.000Z	yoyoned	sleven	there are some files that are not meant to be executable.
2008-10-27T05:15:00.000Z	yoyoned	sleven	in general, it's a bad idea to elevate permissions for no reason
2008-10-27T05:15:00.000Z	sleven	yoyoned	i see
2008-10-27T05:16:00.000Z	sleven		can u do most of the thinhgs u can with linux terminal with win command prompt?
2008-10-27T05:16:00.000Z	sleven		it seems a lot easier and more powerful, have never used wim prompt much
2008-10-27T05:18:00.000Z	yoyoned	sleven	the comand line is like you said.  Fast and powerfull.  it is a bit to learn, but well worth it
