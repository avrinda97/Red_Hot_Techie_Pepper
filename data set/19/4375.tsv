2010-03-21T22:38:00.000Z	eremite	kcantin	please read this -- http://chvnx.com/post/280205781/change-screen-resolution-in-linux-ubuntu
2010-03-21T22:40:00.000Z	eremite	kcantin	your video drivers are not installed properly or something.  I have the same problem.  You need to manually add the resolution using 'xrandr' and then manually set the resolution.  The link I gave y9ou teaches you how to do that, or you can just download teh script file in that post if you want THAT specific resolution.
2010-03-21T22:40:00.000Z	eremite	kcantin	are you ignoring me? :D

2010-03-21T22:46:00.000Z	eremite	kcantin	what are you talking about?  Listen, I gave you a link to fix yoru problem.  Either you will follow the instructions and recieve help or you can try to play the guessing game with random people in here. http://chvnx.com/post/280205781/change-screen-resolution-in-linux-ubuntu  -- do what this website says and your problem will be fixed.  Or don't.
2010-03-21T22:49:00.000Z	eremite	kcantin	ignore repo_man he is trolling (ie: starting trouble for fun)
2010-03-21T22:53:00.000Z	kcantin	eremite	I get errors when I run the script and follow the instruction from the web site?
2010-03-21T22:55:00.000Z	eremite	kcantin	well, you cont do both run teh script AND follow the instructions.  If the script does not work then use the instructions to write yoru own.  Dont just copy every line of the code on the page, use the data to write your own by following the instructions.
