2004-11-21T09:19:00.000Z	Matthew_I		so ubuntu is basically debian, but targeted for the desktop
2004-11-21T09:21:00.000Z	Matthew_I		so basically you guys grab debian unstable, then fix it for distribution, add your utils and call it gravy
2004-11-21T09:21:00.000Z	jdub	Matthew_I	ubuntu isn't desktop specific, we just happen to have a really kickarse desktop :)
2004-11-21T09:22:00.000Z	Matthew_I		has there been any effort to become an official part of the debian project?
2004-11-21T09:22:00.000Z	Matthew_I		or is that not really of intrest?
2004-11-21T09:22:00.000Z	jdub		there's not really any scope for it
2004-11-21T09:23:00.000Z	Matthew_I		one reason I am asking so many quesitons is because I currently use debian unstable for my desktop (I am thinking about switching to ubuntu)
2004-11-21T09:23:00.000Z	Matthew_I		I have a seperate home partition so switching should not be too difficult...
2004-11-21T09:23:00.000Z	Matthew_I		I have for a while now thought that something like this should be made, because debian releases way to slow
2004-11-21T09:24:00.000Z	Matthew_I		I think they should have a server branch, a base branch, and a desktop branch all releasing seperatly...
2004-11-21T09:24:00.000Z	Matthew_I		so for extra packages not in ubuntu do I just pull those from debian?
2004-11-21T09:25:00.000Z	Matthew_I		so where do I get stuff that I might need like mysql or something?
2004-11-21T09:25:00.000Z	Matthew_I	gwildor_	are the packages that heavily modified?
2004-11-21T09:26:00.000Z	Matthew_I	gwildor_	ubuntu must have a stragety for packages that are not there?
2004-11-21T09:26:00.000Z	Matthew_I		so how do you pronounce ubuntu?  is it like ooo-boon-too?
2004-11-21T09:26:00.000Z	Matthew_I		or ooo BOON too?
2004-11-21T09:27:00.000Z	Matthew_I	gwildor_	oh... I figured as much...
2004-11-21T09:27:00.000Z	jdub	Matthew_I	yeah
2004-11-21T09:27:00.000Z	jdub	Matthew_I	ooh-ooh-ooh! ubuntu! :)
