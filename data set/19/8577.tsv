2007-06-13T08:39:00.000Z	nathanj		can anyone help with a tv card?
2007-06-13T08:39:00.000Z	kaktuskatta	nathanj	maybe...what's the problem
2007-06-13T08:40:00.000Z	nathanj	kaktuskatta	it comes up as a bttv0 under dvb0 in dmesg but tvtime/mythtv doesn't find it :s
2007-06-13T08:44:00.000Z	kaktuskatta	nathanj	And the card is listed when you run lspci?
2007-06-13T08:44:00.000Z	nathanj	kaktuskatta	yup as a bt878 card
2007-06-13T08:44:00.000Z	kaktuskatta	nathanj	I assume that youve checked the input settings in tvtime...?
2007-06-13T08:44:00.000Z	nathanj	kaktuskatta	no inputs come up ;s
2007-06-13T08:44:00.000Z	kaktuskatta		Mine works fine with tvtime, I only had problems with sound
2007-06-13T08:44:00.000Z	kaktuskatta		Hmm...who's the manufacturer of the card?
2007-06-13T08:44:00.000Z	nathanj	kaktuskatta	its a dvico dvb-t lite
2007-06-13T08:44:00.000Z	nathanj	kaktuskatta	are options suspose to come under "video source"
2007-06-13T08:44:00.000Z	nathanj		?
2007-06-13T08:45:00.000Z	kaktuskatta	nathanj	well, to be honest I'm not sure
2007-06-13T08:45:00.000Z	kaktuskatta	nathanj	have you been here: http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/index.php/DViCO_FusionHDTV_DVB-T_Lite ?
2007-06-13T08:46:00.000Z	kaktuskatta		I'm experiencing problems with my ATi radeon after an upgrade to Feisty. I've managed to install the drivers, and the card is detected and all, but only as root! If I run fglrxinfo as normal user, I get the mesadrivers, but if i sudo the same command I get the proper info. Which files need changing of permission to fix this?
2007-06-13T08:46:00.000Z	nathanj	kaktuskatta	ill check it out thanks :D
2007-06-13T08:47:00.000Z	kaktuskatta	nathanj	It's supposed to be under "video source"....mine is named "Television" ;)
2007-06-13T08:48:00.000Z	kaktuskatta	nathanj	And remember....google is a great tool :)
2007-06-13T08:48:00.000Z	nathanj	kaktuskatta	it looks like its trying to open /dev/video0 not /dev/dvb0 :D
