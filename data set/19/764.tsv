2011-09-05T16:52:00.000Z	supNow		someone help me please I've been in computer hell for a week!
2011-09-05T16:52:00.000Z	supNow		I installed ubuntu and it took over my entire 2tb drive
2011-09-05T16:52:00.000Z	supNow		windows will not format it back to ntfs
2011-09-05T16:53:00.000Z	supNow		I used disk utility to format to ntfs and windows still won't install on it
2011-09-05T16:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	supNow	you can use the liveCD to resize the Ubuntu partition and make room for the Windows install
2011-09-05T16:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	supNow	you will need to boot to liveCD after the install as Windows will blindly overwite the MBR with its own thing
2011-09-05T16:54:00.000Z	supNow	ActionParsnip	is LiveCD going to be different than the disk utility in ubuntu?
2011-09-05T16:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	supNow	the disk utility will be used, you need the liveCD as you cannot resize mounted partitions
2011-09-05T16:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	supNow	alternatively you can use the Windows installer or liveCD to delete all partitions then install Windows to a portion of the space, then install Ubuntu to the free space
2011-09-05T16:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	supNow	what activities do you do on the remote system?
2011-09-05T16:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	supNow	really? yikes
2011-09-05T17:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	supNow	what OS is the system you are connecting to?
2011-09-05T17:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	supNow	so the client is mac?
2011-09-05T17:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	supNow	strange, so you run photoshop on Linux then VNC to use it on a Mac....
2011-09-05T17:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	supNow	are you serious...
2011-09-05T17:07:00.000Z	supNow	ActionParsnip	yes and no
2011-09-05T17:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	supNow	why not run photoshop on the mac?
2011-09-05T17:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	supNow	could try X forwarding via SSH, it's all I can suggest. Let me see how to make vnc faster, its a horribly old protocol
2011-09-05T17:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	supNow	could try freenx
