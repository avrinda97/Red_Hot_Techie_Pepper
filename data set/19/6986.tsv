2007-10-28T09:45:00.000Z	wobblywu	ozzyparrot	problems regarding... ?
2007-10-28T09:45:00.000Z	wobblywu	ozzyparrot	if you're hoping to run linux on that, get a nvidia
2007-10-28T09:46:00.000Z	ozzyparrot	wobblywu	  nvidia   video card ?
2007-10-28T09:46:00.000Z	wobblywu	ozzyparrot	ati's linux drivers are horrible, nvidia's are half-decent
2007-10-28T09:47:00.000Z	ozzyparrot	wobblywu	 ahh  cool,  thnanks     now i know b4 i buy
2007-10-28T09:47:00.000Z	wobblywu	ozzyparrot	also, in current-generation, nvidia cards are faster than the comparable ati cards anyway
2007-10-28T09:48:00.000Z	ozzyparrot	wobblywu	  i didnt know  that.      any nvidia   dual head cards  u think is best ?
2007-10-28T09:48:00.000Z	wobblywu	ozzyparrot	what budget do you have? and what are you hoping to do with it?
2007-10-28T09:49:00.000Z	wobblywu	ozzyparrot	the best cards price/performance wise on the market right now in my opinion are the 8800gt by nvidia, but a different brand than the standard Nvidia ones
2007-10-28T09:49:00.000Z	wobblywu	ozzyparrot	300-500 usd?
2007-10-28T09:50:00.000Z	wobblywu	ozzyparrot	I thought you were a Sabbath karaoke singer
2007-10-28T09:51:00.000Z	ozzyparrot	wobblywu	   why u say buget over kill ?
2007-10-28T09:51:00.000Z	wobblywu	ozzyparrot	because linux, in all fairness, won't be using your videocard fully anyway.. and office doesn't require that much gpu processing power
2007-10-28T09:54:00.000Z	ozzyparrot	wobblywu	  which gt ?   the gtx  or gts
2007-10-28T09:54:00.000Z	wobblywu	ozzyparrot	the regular gt
2007-10-28T09:54:00.000Z	ozzyparrot	wobblywu	  i suppose the gts  will run the compfision  thing
2007-10-28T09:55:00.000Z	wobblywu	ozzyparrot	8800gts indeed
2007-10-28T09:56:00.000Z	ozzyparrot	wobblywu	 thanks for your help
