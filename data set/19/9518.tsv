2006-10-28T07:09:00.000Z	NemesisD		does anybody know anything about ndiswrapper? i've been screwing around with it for hours now and still can't get my USB network adapter to work
2006-10-28T07:09:00.000Z	Asymmetry	NemesisD	ndiswrapper tends to flake on USB adapters. Do you know what chipset it uses?
2006-10-28T07:09:00.000Z	NemesisD	Asymmetry	as a matter of fact, i do, hold please
2006-10-28T07:09:00.000Z	NemesisD	Asymmetry	AR5005UG
2006-10-28T07:11:00.000Z	Asymmetry	NemesisD	hmm.
2006-10-28T07:12:00.000Z	NemesisD	Asymmetry	i have 2 inf drivers installed for this adapter and they both appear to be working fine
2006-10-28T07:13:00.000Z	Asymmetry	NemesisD	What does iwconfig report?
2006-10-28T07:14:00.000Z	NemesisD	Asymmetry	iwconfig only lists lo, eth0, eth1 and sit0, no wlan0 :(
2006-10-28T07:14:00.000Z	Asymmetry	NemesisD	any wireless extensions listed?
2006-10-28T07:14:00.000Z	NemesisD	Asymmetry	nope, for all of those it says no wireless extensions
2006-10-28T07:14:00.000Z	Asymmetry	NemesisD	hrm.
2006-10-28T07:15:00.000Z	Asymmetry	NemesisD	Not sure.
2006-10-28T07:16:00.000Z	NemesisD	Asymmetry	that seems to be the response im getting from everybody, what should i do now?
2006-10-28T07:16:00.000Z	Asymmetry	NemesisD	Check to see if there is a non-ndiswrapper driver for your Atheros chipset.
2006-10-28T07:17:00.000Z	NemesisD	Asymmetry	this driver is the windows driver from the dlink website...
2006-10-28T07:17:00.000Z	Asymmetry	NemesisD	That would be what I refer to when I say an ndiswrapper driver. Find one written for Linux.
2006-10-28T07:18:00.000Z	NemesisD		Asymmetry ok and when i do what am i going to do?
2006-10-28T07:18:00.000Z	Asymmetry	NemesisD	use it.
2006-10-28T07:18:00.000Z	Asymmetry	NemesisD	it's probably in the form of a kernel module. wpa_supplicant supports madwifi drivers (Atheros) if you need WPA support.
