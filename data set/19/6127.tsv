2008-10-15T14:16:00.000Z	linuxius		hi! how can I connect to a USB-device that is recognized but not active in vmware? (http://img262.imageshack.us/my.php?image=usbex0.jpg)
2008-10-15T14:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	linuxius	is it in device manager?
2008-10-15T14:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	linuxius	looks like a winxp VM
2008-10-15T14:19:00.000Z	linuxius	ActionParsnip	the two that are checked on the image are there (without name though... unknown device) but the 3 others arent...
2008-10-15T14:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	linuxius	if you swap usb ports round does it switch in the VM (id shutdown the vm first)
2008-10-15T14:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	linuxius	are you using hubs? does it work if you connect direct
2008-10-15T14:23:00.000Z	linuxius	ActionParsnip	ok, no hubs, directly connected to the laptop. they don't switch in the VM...
2012-03-16T16:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	linuxius	set the interface as DHCP and itwill get an IP off your router
2012-03-16T17:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	linuxius	then you wil need to set the interface you connect with to fall into the same subnet as the device, you will also need a crossover cable as you are connecting peer to peer
2012-03-16T17:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	linuxius	a NAS can be on a router, as long as there is a logical link it will work
2012-03-16T17:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	linuxius	set the interface to be a static IP and set it to fall in to the netmask used by the device.
2012-03-16T17:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	linuxius	its a p2p lan, there is no gateway
2012-03-16T17:07:00.000Z	linuxius	ActionParsnip	 how can I tell the network manager?
2012-03-16T17:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	linuxius	you set the interface to Manual, then specify the details
2012-03-16T17:09:00.000Z	linuxius	ActionParsnip	I got so far... Then it asks for Adress, Subnet and Gateway...
2012-03-16T17:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	linuxius	yes, set it to similar to the device, but change the last octet of the address, the subnet will be the same
2012-03-16T17:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	linuxius	what is the address of the device?
2012-03-16T17:15:00.000Z	linuxius	ActionParsnip	in the manual it says "open a web browser and enter the IP address of the NAS: http://169.254.100.100:8080/ (make sure the IP address of your PC is configured to the same subnet, e.g. 169.254.100.1. I cannot klick apply in the network settings with IP 169.254.100.10 and subnet 169.254.0.0... that should be correct though, right?
2012-03-16T17:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	linuxius	then 169.254.100.10    subnet 255.255.255.0   will be fine
