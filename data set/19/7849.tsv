2007-06-14T15:03:00.000Z	OmegaCenti	bacon|ubuntu	full bar what.
2007-06-14T15:04:00.000Z	OmegaCenti	bacon|ubuntu	you want to know why full bar means nothing? windows ALWAYS stays at full bar why? because it automatically backs down the speed to a new level, thats not an indicator of signal strength, that an indicator of how well that signal level will work for that speed.
