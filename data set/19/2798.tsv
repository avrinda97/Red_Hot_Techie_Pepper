2010-03-03T11:42:00.000Z	theadmin		Yah i keep XP and Ubuntu together, Lappie, i have some experience with that, so you can ask any questions away about it. note that installing Windows after Linux will destroy GRUB, so keep an Ubuntu Live CD near ya
2010-03-03T11:43:00.000Z	adarsha	theadmin	is there any way to get back grub after it got destroyed by installing windows? or should i install ubuntu all over again?
2010-03-03T11:44:00.000Z	theadmin	adarsha	Boot from a livecd, do "grub-install /dev/sda1" (or whatever). Done
2010-03-03T11:44:00.000Z	theadmin	adarsha	Err, /dev/sda, sorry, must be installed on top of the drive
2010-03-03T11:45:00.000Z	adarsha	theadmin	sorry, i didn't get it.
2010-03-03T11:46:00.000Z	theadmin	adarsha	Well, there are partitions (/dev/sda1, /dev/sda2) and drives (/dev/sda, /dev/sdb, etc)
2010-03-03T11:46:00.000Z	adarsha	theadmin	ok,
2010-03-05T12:19:00.000Z	adarsha	theadmin	but wine doesn't work for many windows applications.
2010-03-05T12:24:00.000Z	adarsha	theadmin	my firefox doesn't freeze, just says can't connect to 127.0.0.1
2010-03-05T12:25:00.000Z	theadmin	adarsha	Hm. Running no server i belive? :D
