2011-01-31T07:58:00.000Z	edbian	themonarch	no worries.  So is this wubi?  Did you install this while windows was running?
2011-01-31T07:59:00.000Z	edbian	themonarch	I know that.  I'm asking, when you installed, did you run the installer from inside windows?  Or did you boot the cd ?
2011-01-31T08:00:00.000Z	edbian	themonarch	You never burned a cd?  Then you are using wubi.  Wubi is a special installer that lets you install Ubuntu as if it were a window application. (but lets you boot into it normally)  There is a file on your windows partition that acts as Ubuntu's harddrive.  That file is limiting your size.
2011-01-31T08:02:00.000Z	edbian	themonarch	You can make the file bigger, I'm not sure how (just google it).  A proper install would also fix the problem.
2011-01-31T08:02:00.000Z	edbian	themonarch	What is the ultimate problem / goal here?
2011-01-31T08:03:00.000Z	edbian	themonarch	you have to partition the harddrive.  Ubuntu cannot be installed on NTFS partitions
2011-01-31T08:04:00.000Z	edbian	themonarch	no but it is not 'easy' to transfer the data you have
2011-01-31T08:07:00.000Z	edbian	themonarch	not a bad idea ;)
2011-01-31T08:07:00.000Z	edbian	themonarch	you don't HAVE to have a cd or usb but those are the easiest methods
