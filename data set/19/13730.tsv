2005-02-02T10:42:00.000Z	pestil	daniels	"everyone" thinks /opt is a bad idea? first time I hear that theory
2005-02-02T10:44:00.000Z	daniels	pestil	it's been discussed to death, and virtually no-one within any distro community has come out with a differing opinion.  the only people who really use /opt are kde developers, so they can easily nuke /opt/qt3 and /opt/kde3.  (speaking as a former kde developer)
2005-02-02T10:45:00.000Z	pestil	daniels	I guess I gotta get out more. Into the discussions, I mean.    In theory, /opt sounds like a viable solution to the non-standardness of locations, where stuff is either put in /usr/bin or /usr/local/ or /usr/share or even /etc sometimes
2005-02-02T10:46:00.000Z	pestil	daniels	In practice I agree not many use the /opt feature
2005-02-02T10:46:00.000Z	daniels	pestil	it's put into /usr/bin, /usr/local, /usr/share, and /etc
2005-02-02T10:47:00.000Z	pestil	daniels	but app developers don't always make their minds and they put them in *whichever* of those 4 or 5 locations, regardless of your "hierarchy standard"
2005-02-02T10:48:00.000Z	daniels	pestil	app developers use autoconf, which has a prefix, so you can change this sort of thing
2005-02-02T10:48:00.000Z	daniels	pestil	distributions standardise things, and almost always to /usr
2005-02-02T10:48:00.000Z	daniels	pestil	imagine for a second that everything you installed was in /opt.  imagine how large your $PATH now is.
2005-02-02T10:50:00.000Z	daniels	pestil	what sort of distribution puts anything in /usr/local?
2005-02-02T10:50:00.000Z	daniels	pestil	/usr/local is explicitly defined as a space for the user to put stuff under, and any distribution with half a clue will respect that and leave it well alone
2005-02-02T10:51:00.000Z	pestil	daniels	you say there have been a lot of discussion on this. I understand that you've seen a few. I guess I've been in other things. Could you perhaps direct me to one of the more intelligent discussions on this? I don't wanna be spreading all through google
2005-02-02T10:52:00.000Z	pestil	daniels	distro here is Ubuntu. ditto Mandrake
2005-02-02T10:53:00.000Z	daniels	pestil	mmm, I can't really find any quickly, sorry
2005-02-02T10:54:00.000Z	pestil	daniels	how do I find my version of gtk?
2005-02-02T10:54:00.000Z	daniels	pestil	dpkg -l libgtk\*
2005-02-02T10:56:00.000Z	pestil	daniels	thanks
2005-02-02T11:01:00.000Z	pestil	daniels	on a scale of 1 to 10, how risky it is to compile a different version of gtk into Ubuntu than the one currently installed, or available in repositores? Ubuntu tells me I have gtk 2.4.9, and my "experiment" would be a gtk 2.4.3
