2008-10-18T23:08:00.000Z	Clockswork	Reign	Really? Thank god
2008-10-18T23:08:00.000Z	Clockswork	Reign	The Bloog Red color that fills the bar scared me :P
2008-10-18T23:10:00.000Z	Clockswork	Reign	Og allright, I wont worry too much then :P
2008-10-18T23:11:00.000Z	Clockswork	Reign	My fans just kicked in and according to the sensor one of them are spinning at 92400 RPM? Can that be right?
2008-10-18T23:12:00.000Z	Clockswork	Reign	yeah :P
2008-10-18T23:13:00.000Z	Clockswork	Reign	Well I'll take these sensors with a grain of salt then :P the fans took my CPU down to 42 degrees and my GPU to 58
2008-10-18T23:13:00.000Z	Clockswork	Reign	Nothing that could harm my computer
2008-10-18T23:14:00.000Z	Clockswork	Reign	Allright, yeah I think my fans kick in when the CPU is at 53-55...
2008-10-18T23:14:00.000Z	Clockswork	Reign	Wish there would be an easy way to manage the fans -.-
2008-10-18T23:15:00.000Z	Clockswork	Reign	I know but I dont know how to :/
2008-10-18T23:15:00.000Z	Clockswork	Reign	Nothing in my BIOS and with my current Dell model (XPS m1530) there isnt an fan control app yet
2008-10-18T23:15:00.000Z	Clockswork	Reign	Allright will do..
