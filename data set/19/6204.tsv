2008-06-12T02:16:00.000Z	heymr		can I make mutt format html messages using lynx?
2008-06-12T02:17:00.000Z	puff	heymr	For disply, yes, I use it all the time.  Or elinks, or links.
2008-06-12T02:17:00.000Z	heymr	puff	inline mutt? how?
2008-06-12T02:18:00.000Z	puff	heymr	Come to think of it, I've never had to set that up, I guess when I installed mutt and links it set it up for me.
2008-06-12T02:18:00.000Z	heymr	puff	or do you download and then open with lynx?
2008-06-12T02:18:00.000Z	puff	heymr	No, trydoing info ("i") on the message to display the parts, navigate to the HTML part and hit enter.
2008-06-12T02:19:00.000Z	heymr	puff	so it uses links?
2008-06-12T02:19:00.000Z	puff	heymr	Yeah.
2008-06-12T02:20:00.000Z	heymr	puff	installed links.. still not parsing it
2008-06-12T02:21:00.000Z	puff	heymr	Did you restart mutt?
2008-06-12T02:21:00.000Z	heymr	puff	yes
2008-06-12T02:22:00.000Z	heymr	puff	oh maybe its reading from cache?
2008-06-12T02:22:00.000Z	puff	heymr	Hm, according to google, .mailcap is what controls that, but my .mailcap doesn't have a lynx/links entry.
2008-06-12T02:23:00.000Z	puff	heymr	Might be in muttrc, one sec.
2008-06-12T02:23:00.000Z	heymr	puff	maybe for older version?
2008-06-12T02:24:00.000Z	puff	heymr	Might be better to ask on #mutt.
2008-06-12T02:25:00.000Z	heymr	puff	nobody awnsers :/
2008-06-12T02:25:00.000Z	heymr	puff	I don't even use ubuntu, but this channel is most active
