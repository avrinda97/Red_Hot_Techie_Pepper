2007-06-17T11:47:00.000Z	HorizonXP		hey, what's the better virtualization software?
2007-06-17T11:47:00.000Z	HorizonXP		qemu, vmware-server, or virtualbox?
2007-06-17T11:49:00.000Z	FreeFull	HorizonXP	If you want emulation, QEmu is free, VMware is good and I dont know about virtualbox. For virtualization use xen or vmware
2007-06-17T11:50:00.000Z	HorizonXP	FreeFull	What's xen? and how's the USB device support on any of them?
2007-06-17T11:51:00.000Z	FreeFull	HorizonXP	QEmu, VMware and Xen should be fine with USB
2007-06-17T11:51:00.000Z	HorizonXP	FreeFull	I need something that will allow the virutal OS direct access to the USB port... VMWare Server doesn't, because it couldn't detect this FPGA board i was working with
2007-06-17T11:51:00.000Z	FreeFull	HorizonXP	You have to configure VMware to get usb
2007-06-17T11:51:00.000Z	HorizonXP	FreeFull	Ok, I might try QEmu.. last question: Core 2's, what's the VT option that's in it?
2007-06-17T11:53:00.000Z	FreeFull	HorizonXP	In VMware ubuntu doesnt actually need drivers for the device for it to work on the virtual machine
2007-06-17T11:54:00.000Z	HorizonXP	FreeFull	You sure? maybe you're right, i didn't know that I had to install USB support for VMWare
2007-06-17T11:54:00.000Z	FreeFull	HorizonXP	You need to configure VMware to use usb trough
2007-06-17T11:54:00.000Z	FreeFull	HorizonXP	I'll search in VMware online manuals
2007-06-17T11:56:00.000Z	FreeFull	HorizonXP	http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?cmd=displayKC&docType=kc&externalId=3862823&sliceId=2&docTypeID=DT_KB_1_1&dialogID=9713833&stateId=0%200%209709763
2007-06-17T11:56:00.000Z	HorizonXP	FreeFull	All right, I'm going to give this a shot
2007-06-17T11:56:00.000Z	HorizonXP	FreeFull	Nothing to lose anyway
2007-06-17T11:57:00.000Z	FreeFull	HorizonXP	After you will be done usb should work with VMware Workstation
2007-06-17T11:58:00.000Z	HorizonXP	FreeFull	What about VMWare Server?
2007-06-17T11:59:00.000Z	FreeFull	HorizonXP	WMware Server should work too
2007-06-17T12:01:00.000Z	HorizonXP	FreeFull	Phew, ok cool
