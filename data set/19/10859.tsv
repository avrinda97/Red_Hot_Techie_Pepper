2006-10-27T06:21:00.000Z	tijn		just upgraded to edgy, and i have a few probs, my sound doenst work anymore (only as root) added my user to the audio group, but nothing, 2nd, when i go to a site (Firefox 2.0) it crashes, this has something to do with flash i think
2006-10-27T06:21:00.000Z	aris	tijn	have you delogged/relogged yourself after adding you in audio group ?
2006-10-27T06:22:00.000Z	tijn	aris	eerh :)
2006-10-27T06:23:00.000Z	tijn	aris	thnx m8 :) works heh
2006-10-27T06:25:00.000Z	aris	tijn	you did an upgrade ?
2006-10-27T06:25:00.000Z	tijn	aris	yes
2006-10-27T06:25:00.000Z	aris	tijn	how did you install flash in the first place ?
2006-10-27T06:25:00.000Z	tijn	aris	flashplugin-nonfree
2006-10-27T06:26:00.000Z	aris	tijn	thus it should be reported. Do you get a bug report window when it crashes ?
2006-10-27T06:27:00.000Z	aris	tijn	i dont know how to make the automate reporter work that way
2006-10-27T06:28:00.000Z	tijn	aris	The program 'Gecko' received an X Window System error.     this error i get when i run firefox in a terminal
2006-10-27T06:29:00.000Z	aris	tijn	ah, that's a bug but not exactly a crash
2006-10-27T06:29:00.000Z	aris	tijn	you should fill a bugreport with the circonstance of the crash and that error message
2006-10-27T06:30:00.000Z	tijn	aris	i will do that :) thnx for the help
2006-10-27T06:30:00.000Z	aris	tijn	else, do like me... i live perfectly without flash
2006-10-27T06:30:00.000Z	aris	tijn	since it won't work on amd64
2006-10-27T06:30:00.000Z	tijn	aris	that would an option
2006-10-27T06:32:00.000Z	aris	tijn	aha
