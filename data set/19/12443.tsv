2006-04-17T08:28:00.000Z	stjepan		hi
2006-04-17T08:28:00.000Z	stjepan		can I install ubuntu from knoppix or from a working gentoo system?
2006-04-17T08:28:00.000Z	stjepan		I can't boot the ubunut cd
2006-04-17T08:30:00.000Z	stjepan		it refuses to boot it
2006-04-17T08:30:00.000Z	stjepan		don't know why
2006-04-17T08:30:00.000Z	stjepan		md5sum is ok
2006-04-17T08:30:00.000Z	Stormx2	stjepan	Any errors?
2006-04-17T08:30:00.000Z	stjepan	Stormx2	no errors :(
2006-04-17T08:30:00.000Z	Stormx2	stjepan	Does it *try*?
2006-04-17T08:30:00.000Z	stjepan	Stormx2	yes it tries to boot it, I think so
2006-04-17T08:31:00.000Z	Stormx2	stjepan	All I can say is try burning again, at fairly slow speed (4x or less).
2006-04-17T08:31:00.000Z	stjepan	Stormx2	I burned it at 24x speed
2006-04-17T08:31:00.000Z	Stormx2	stjepan	That may be why then
2006-04-17T08:32:00.000Z	stjepan	Stormx2	do you really think I should burn it at <= 4x? I burned it several times at 24x
2006-04-17T08:32:00.000Z	stjepan	Stormx2	and md5sum is OK
2006-04-17T08:32:00.000Z	Stormx2	stjepan	Well, you are more likely to get "bad burns" at higher speeds
2006-04-17T08:32:00.000Z	Stormx2	stjepan	MD5 of the file or the cd?
2006-04-17T08:32:00.000Z	stjepan	Stormx2	both
2006-04-17T08:33:00.000Z	Stormx2	stjepan	And you compared with the reference online, yeah?
