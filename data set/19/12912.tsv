2008-09-01T18:16:00.000Z	erUSUL	smm289	linux does not support N as wols_ already said
2008-09-01T18:23:00.000Z	erUSUL	smm289	whichever you please usually something under /media/ ( /media/iso for example )
2008-09-01T18:25:00.000Z	erUSUL	smm289	you will have to create the dir beforehand (sudo mkdir /media/iso )
2008-09-01T18:26:00.000Z	erUSUL	smm289	a mount point is a directory of the filesystem nothing more nothing less
2008-09-01T18:53:00.000Z	erUSUL	smm289	there is no need for such a thing in ubuntu
2008-09-01T18:55:00.000Z	erUSUL	smm289	mostly. "sudo apt-get clean" from time to time
2008-09-01T19:07:00.000Z	erUSUL	smm289	the same just accept defaults
2008-09-01T19:09:00.000Z	erUSUL	smm289	the just put c:\program_name ??
2008-09-01T19:12:00.000Z	erUSUL	smm289	consult appdb.winehq.org
2008-10-03T18:05:00.000Z	erUSUL	smm289	press "q"
2008-10-03T18:07:00.000Z	erUSUL	smm289	man man
2008-10-03T18:08:00.000Z	erUSUL	smm289	sorry but a more usefull man page is the one of the pager used by default to see them "man less"
2008-10-08T17:34:00.000Z	erUSUL	smm289	"sudo lshw"
