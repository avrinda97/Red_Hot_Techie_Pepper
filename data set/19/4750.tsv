2009-01-31T18:04:00.000Z	Zzeiss		Question on digital signatures: when I run the update manager, I get: "The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY 8DB7F87A2B97B7B8"
2009-01-31T18:04:00.000Z	binarymutant	Zzeiss	ya it's cool if you trust the source
2009-01-31T18:04:00.000Z	Zzeiss	binarymutant	OK, how do I know where it's coming from?
2009-01-31T18:05:00.000Z	binarymutant	Zzeiss	pastebin /etc/apt/source.list
2009-01-31T18:07:00.000Z	Zzeiss	binarymutant	Pasted.  Thanks!
2009-01-31T18:09:00.000Z	Zzeiss	binarymutant	http://paste.ubuntu.com/112062/
2009-01-31T18:11:00.000Z	binarymutant	Zzeiss	search up ubuntu-keyring and install that, should make that error go away
2009-01-31T18:13:00.000Z	Zzeiss	binarymutant	Thanks!  I'm on it...
2009-01-31T18:14:00.000Z	Zzeiss	binarymutant	No joy on that.  "ubuntu-keyring is already the newest version."
2009-01-31T18:14:00.000Z	binarymutant	Zzeiss	?!?
2009-01-31T18:15:00.000Z	Zzeiss	binarymutant	Yep.  :-(
2009-01-31T18:16:00.000Z	binarymutant	Zzeiss	oh it's the ppa
2009-01-31T18:17:00.000Z	binarymutant	Zzeiss	here try this link http://news.launchpad.net/ppa/adding-a-ppas-key-to-ubuntu
2009-01-31T18:17:00.000Z	binarymutant	Zzeiss	if you trust that "extra macstuff", the ppa you have, then it's okay to safely ignore
2009-01-31T18:18:00.000Z	Zzeiss	binarymutant	Yeah.  No choice in the matter.  I'm running on a macbook unibody.
2009-01-31T18:20:00.000Z	binarymutant	Zzeiss	that link I gave shows how to add ppa keys
2009-01-31T18:24:00.000Z	Zzeiss	binarymutant	Yeah, there is.  But it's a joke - it's really a text file of instructions on how to install the virus, with variations for different distributions and things like "if you are under ubuntu, please remember that Canonical does not support this virus"
2009-01-31T18:24:00.000Z	binarymutant	Zzeiss	lol
2009-01-31T18:24:00.000Z	binarymutant	Zzeiss	LTS for viri
