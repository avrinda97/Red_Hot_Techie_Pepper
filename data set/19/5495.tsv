2012-04-01T00:05:00.000Z	Guest25963		ok thanks
2012-04-01T00:05:00.000Z	Guest25963		i m looking for a solution
2012-04-01T00:06:00.000Z	babble	Guest25963	In Xubuntu, try the Character Map, from the Applications menu. Apps Menu > Accessories > Character Map
2012-04-01T00:10:00.000Z	babble	Guest25963	I think I understand what you mean, but give me a moment; let me find the correct character codes for what are - I hope - the accented characters you need.
2012-04-01T00:12:00.000Z	babble	Guest25963	open the character map, and search for 00E0 (zero-zero-E-zero) - make sure "Search in Character Details" is checked.
2012-04-01T00:16:00.000Z	babble	Guest25963	give me a moment. Let me enable a spanish layout and make sure it'll have easy access to the characters you want.
2012-04-01T00:26:00.000Z	babble	Guest25963	okay, I think I have a workable solution for you.
2012-04-01T00:26:00.000Z	babble	Guest25963	Are you in Xubuntu (just to confirm)
2012-04-01T00:27:00.000Z	babble	Guest25963	open Settings Manager, and open Session and Autostart
2012-04-01T00:32:00.000Z	babble	Guest25963	open System Settings (I don't know what it will be called in the French localization, but if you're still stuck, let me know and I'll see if I can find its translation)
2012-04-01T00:35:00.000Z	babble	Guest25963	Okay, if you have Session and Autostart open, go to the LAST tab, called Advanced.
2012-04-01T00:38:00.000Z	babble	Guest25963	See here: http://ubuntuone.com/3D89ufBRcr7FzIVfY720UV
2012-04-01T00:42:00.000Z	babble	Guest25963	With those things done, log out and back in (so Gnome services will start) and you'll see a keyboard layout chooser up in your panel, in the indicators area
2012-04-01T00:42:00.000Z	babble	Guest25963	You need to log out and back in once you enable Gnome services, and the additional layout
2012-04-01T00:43:00.000Z	babble	Guest25963	No, from the Application (mouse) menu, choose Log Out at the bottom, and then log back in
