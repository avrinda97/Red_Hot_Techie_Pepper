2009-08-25T19:50:00.000Z	grawity	kri	There are lots.
2009-08-25T19:50:00.000Z	grawity	kri	GNOME isn't actually a window manager -- it uses Metacity or Compiz.
2009-08-25T19:51:00.000Z	grawity	kri	Anyway, check Fluxbox, Enlightenment, Openbox, twm, IceWM, Xfce, wmii...
2009-08-25T20:03:00.000Z	grawity	kri	That depends on the window theme you are using.
2009-08-25T20:04:00.000Z	kri	grawity	every theme thats are preinstalled have pixels (gnome)
2009-08-25T20:05:00.000Z	grawity	kri	In the appearance settings window, click on 'Customize' button.

2009-08-25T20:05:00.000Z	kri	grawity	then window boarder?
2009-08-25T20:05:00.000Z	grawity	kri	Yes. Is 'Metabox' listed somewhere?
2009-08-25T20:05:00.000Z	kri	grawity	yes i use it..
