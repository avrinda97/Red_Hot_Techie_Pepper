2005-12-06T08:07:00.000Z	rohan		does ubuntu live cd have gparted ?
2005-12-06T08:07:00.000Z	rohan		if not, know of any live cd which does ?
2005-12-06T08:07:00.000Z	rohan		not qtparted, gparted
2005-12-06T08:08:00.000Z	rohan		i was preferably looking for a relatively small live cd
2005-12-06T08:08:00.000Z	rohan		:(
2005-12-06T08:09:00.000Z	rohan		qtparted has trashed my disk twice
2005-12-06T08:09:00.000Z	rohan		hmm... whats the easiest way to copy partitions ?
2005-12-06T08:09:00.000Z	rohan		dd ?
2005-12-06T08:10:00.000Z	rohan		i want to move hdc7 to hdc1
2005-12-06T08:10:00.000Z	rohan		what should hdc1 be ? free space ? reiser system ?
2005-12-06T08:10:00.000Z	kyncani	rohan	cp -a is very convenient i think
2005-12-06T08:10:00.000Z	rohan	kyncani	wont dd be safer ?
2005-12-06T08:10:00.000Z	rohan	kyncani	and faster
2005-12-06T08:11:00.000Z	kyncani	rohan	cp is very safe, it can transfer data regardless of source and dest partition types. Plus, cp only copy real data, not empty fs blocks.
2005-12-06T08:12:00.000Z	kyncani	rohan	and it's a simple and effective solution :)
2005-12-06T08:12:00.000Z	rohan	kyncani	ah, ok.,
2005-12-06T08:12:00.000Z	rohan	kyncani	wow! i can copy reiser stuff to reiser4, that way ?
2005-12-06T08:13:00.000Z	kyncani	rohan	like YukiIkyuta said, cp will just copy files, almost as if you copied them from nautilus
2007-01-08T11:06:00.000Z	kyncani	rohan	this is #ubuntu, you might try #mepis or something like that
