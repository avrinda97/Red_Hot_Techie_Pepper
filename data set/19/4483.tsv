2010-09-21T21:49:00.000Z	till_		ah!
2010-09-21T21:49:00.000Z	sacarlson	till_	if network manager fails maybe try wicd as an alternate
2010-09-21T21:50:00.000Z	sacarlson	till_	I assume your adsl box does the dhcp server part
2010-09-21T21:52:00.000Z	till_	sacarlson	<dsl>-<wifi>-client - my wifi provides IPs using dhcp
2010-09-21T21:53:00.000Z	sacarlson	till_	I'm not sure that your problem is with the dhcp then, it could be your wifi drivers or just not a close enuf connection to wifi.  wicd works better for me in wifi
2010-09-21T21:54:00.000Z	till_	sacarlson	it's an actual problem with dhclient and the network-manager.
2010-09-21T21:55:00.000Z	sacarlson	till_	well try turn off network-manager and run dhclient wlanX and see if it works then
2010-09-21T21:55:00.000Z	till_	sacarlson	yes it does, but i'd like to keep the network manager ;)
2010-09-21T21:55:00.000Z	sacarlson	till_	wicd is a network manager
2010-09-21T21:56:00.000Z	sacarlson	till_	wicd takes the place of network-manager
2010-09-21T21:56:00.000Z	till_	sacarlson	is there no way to use the regular network-manager? i don't want to install something else, i want to fix this. i have 50 or so profiles in there etc..
2010-09-21T21:57:00.000Z	sacarlson	till_	well for one thing you need to isolate your problem
2010-09-21T21:57:00.000Z	till_	sacarlson	check the bug - it's very isolated
2010-09-21T21:58:00.000Z	sacarlson	till_	I read it.  it looks like incompatible network-manager
2010-09-21T21:59:00.000Z	sacarlson	till_	like I said I had problems with network-manager I just prefer the wicd networkmanger to each his own
2010-09-21T21:59:00.000Z	till_	sacarlson	yeah, i just wanted to fix this so it doesn't happen again. i don't wanna install other software.
2010-09-21T22:00:00.000Z	sacarlson	till_	well if dhclient works with network-manger disabled it seems you isolated your problem
2010-09-21T22:01:00.000Z	sacarlson	till_	you sure you didn't modify /etc/networks/interfaces ?  that might mess up network-manager
2010-09-21T22:02:00.000Z	till_	sacarlson	no
