2008-02-01T00:10:00.000Z	YixilTesiphon		hi, I'm a noob, and I'm trying to get ubuntu working on my lenovo t60p. I can't get it to recognize any internet connection - doesn't think I have a wireless card and when I plug in an ethernet cable the light comes on but ubuntu doesn't see it
2008-02-01T00:11:00.000Z	shade052	YixilTesiphon	: did you configure the network connection?
2008-02-01T00:11:00.000Z	YixilTesiphon	shade052	the "configure" button is greyed-over
2008-02-01T00:12:00.000Z	shade052	YixilTesiphon	: try the icon on the top left.
2008-02-01T00:12:00.000Z	shade052	YixilTesiphon	: click on it and select manual config
2008-02-01T00:12:00.000Z	YixilTesiphon	shade052	what will I be able to do from there?
2008-02-01T00:13:00.000Z	shade052	YixilTesiphon	: did you get the window of networking?
2008-02-01T00:13:00.000Z	YixilTesiphon	shade052	I believe I was in the network connections screen
2008-02-01T00:13:00.000Z	YixilTesiphon		only thing it was seeing was "local loopback"
2008-02-01T00:13:00.000Z	YixilTesiphon		(I'm on xp right now)
2008-02-01T00:14:00.000Z	shade052	YixilTesiphon	: k
2008-02-01T00:14:00.000Z	shade052	YixilTesiphon	: well you need to obtain ip address automacilly like in windows
2008-02-01T00:14:00.000Z	YixilTesiphon	shade052	I'll boot into ubuntu and see if I can figure more out, thanks for your help
2008-02-01T00:15:00.000Z	shade052	YixilTesiphon	: wait
2008-02-01T00:15:00.000Z	shade052	YixilTesiphon	: you listening?
