2006-07-04T10:46:00.000Z	pete27		cool
2006-07-04T10:47:00.000Z	pete27		Everyone makes a big deal about ubuntu, so I figured maybe they did some nice stuff with gnome.
2006-07-04T10:47:00.000Z	pete27		And I thought that Kubuntu might have been an afterthought
2006-07-04T10:48:00.000Z	pete27		hence I should give ubuntu a shot instead of kubuntu, but if that's not the case, I'll go with kubuntu
2006-07-04T10:48:00.000Z	pete27		I checked our Koraraa and it was awesome
2006-07-04T10:49:00.000Z	pete27		nah, the gentoo HOWTO says xgl and compiz work fine with KDE
2006-07-04T10:49:00.000Z	pete27		I would try Xgl with gentoo but I'de have to reemerge X and gnome and that takes about a day
2006-07-04T10:50:00.000Z	pete27		sweet
2006-07-04T10:50:00.000Z	pete27		it is pretty damned cool
2006-07-04T10:51:00.000Z	pete27		buy it at a store
2006-07-04T10:52:00.000Z	noiesmo	pete27	howto on site as well for kubuntu dapper
2006-07-04T10:46:00.000Z	noiesmo	pete27	only if you want to learn gnome other wise the kubuntu and ubuntu same base just desktop varies
2006-07-04T10:49:00.000Z	noiesmo	pete27	no problems here  running kde xgl/compiz
2006-07-04T10:49:00.000Z	pete27	noiesmo	can you run opengl apps inside Xgl
2006-07-04T10:50:00.000Z	noiesmo	pete27	can play quake3
2006-07-04T10:50:00.000Z	noiesmo	pete27	but i have setup so can switch between xgl compiz and normal as some sdl apps dont like xgl compiz
2006-07-04T10:51:00.000Z	pete27	noiesmo	I imagine I would do the same
