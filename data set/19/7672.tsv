2007-07-15T09:29:00.000Z	HEP85	Newbie_Dude	no just use it as a last resort, if you don't get it manually to work

2007-07-15T09:38:00.000Z	Newbie_Dude	HEP85	it worked, but how do I find that executable for example if i wanted to make a link to it and put an icon on my desktop?

2007-07-15T12:35:00.000Z	HEP85	Newbie_Dude	is your user account in the cdrom system group?
2007-07-15T12:36:00.000Z	Newbie_Dude	HEP85	we found the problem it's that Quake4 CDs are knwon to be set to root permission :P according to serenity
2007-07-15T12:36:00.000Z	Newbie_Dude	HEP85	i've only had the problem with the Quake 4 CD, but also the Quake 4 CD was the first non-burnt CD i put in, so it was just coincidence and i thought it was all non-burnt CDs
