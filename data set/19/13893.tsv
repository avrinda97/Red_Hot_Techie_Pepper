2005-04-20T09:51:00.000Z	mdke		does anyone know anything about ssh keys? I'm following the howto on the wiki, and at one stage it says "Add an SSH call to your crontab and you are set." Does anyone know HOW to do this? thanks in advance
2005-04-20T09:51:00.000Z	olorin	mdke	what do you want to do whith ssh keys ?
2005-04-20T09:52:00.000Z	mdke	olorin	i want to use them to authenticate over ssh, and also to make a key to automate backups over ssh
2005-04-20T09:52:00.000Z	olorin	mdke	i use keychain
2005-04-20T09:52:00.000Z	olorin	mdke	sudo apt-get install keychain
2005-04-20T09:52:00.000Z	mdke	olorin	what is that?
2005-04-20T09:53:00.000Z	olorin	mdke	you can re-use a existing ssh agent with it
2005-04-20T09:53:00.000Z	mdke	olorin	right but I still need to set up crontab properly don't i?
2005-04-20T09:54:00.000Z	olorin	mdke	for me no ... i just enter my password at boot and it's done
2005-04-20T09:55:00.000Z	mdke	olorin	what is done?
2005-04-20T09:55:00.000Z	olorin	mdke	each time i ssh on a remote server, i dont have to enter my password
2005-04-20T09:55:00.000Z	olorin	mdke	beacause i put my public key on each if them
2005-04-20T09:56:00.000Z	mdke	olorin	does your ssh key have a passphrase?
2005-04-20T09:57:00.000Z	olorin	mdke	yes, in fact, when i said password, it was passphrase
2005-04-20T09:57:00.000Z	mdke	olorin	so there is a daemon remembering and entering your passphrase automatically?
2005-04-20T09:58:00.000Z	olorin	mdke	the ssh-agent
2005-04-20T09:58:00.000Z	olorin	mdke	if you want, we can make it step by step
2005-04-20T09:58:00.000Z	mdke	olorin	no i think i'd rather have separate keys
2005-04-20T09:59:00.000Z	olorin	mdke	ok
