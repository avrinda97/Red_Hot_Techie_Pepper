2009-09-11T05:29:00.000Z	TTNK		my usb transfers are very slow, how can i make them faster? it seems like usb1 instead of usb2
2009-09-11T05:29:00.000Z	cornet	TTNK	transfers from what ?
2009-09-11T05:30:00.000Z	TTNK		cornet just to transfer to an usb pen from my computer and backto other computer
2009-09-11T05:30:00.000Z	cornet	TTNK	could it be the USB key ?
2009-09-11T05:31:00.000Z	cornet	TTNK	some of them are frightfully slow
2009-09-11T05:31:00.000Z	TTNK		cornet dont thinks so, i have many usb and it happens with all of them, i have 4 computers too and it happens with all of them too
2009-09-11T05:32:00.000Z	cornet	TTNK	all computers the same ?
2009-09-11T05:32:00.000Z	TTNK		cornet yes, it starts fast but it decreases the speed
2009-09-11T05:33:00.000Z	cornet	TTNK	have you done some tests with dd or bonnie to see if  exactly what the rate of transfer is ?
2009-09-11T05:34:00.000Z	TTNK		cornet i was reading this http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-hardware-18/ext3-usb-hd-slow-transfer-rates-ubuntumanual-mount-646506/ i dont know if its outdated, and i couldnt find where to change tofix it,thesolution is in post #7
2009-09-11T05:34:00.000Z	TTNK		cornet no i havent, i have just been using nautilus
2009-09-11T05:37:00.000Z	cornet	TTNK	ok you need to add those options to the kernel boot line
2009-09-11T05:37:00.000Z	TTNK		cornet i dont know how to do it, can you tell me please how?
2009-09-11T05:38:00.000Z	TTNK	monte	maybe you dont have a bottom bar to hold them
2009-09-11T05:38:00.000Z	cornet	TTNK	Take a look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootOptions about 1/2 way down the page, you want the section entitled "Change Boot Options Temporarily For An Existing Installation"
2009-09-11T05:39:00.000Z	cornet	TTNK	a bit further down it'll also tell you how to change them perminantly
2009-09-11T05:39:00.000Z	TTNK		is that the acpi thing?
2009-09-11T05:39:00.000Z	TTNK		cornet great, let me read it :Dthanks a lot
2009-09-11T05:39:00.000Z	cornet	TTNK	np - hope you get it fixed :)
