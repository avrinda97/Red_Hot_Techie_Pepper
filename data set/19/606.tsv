2011-11-21T21:02:00.000Z	pangur		I have installed spyder on my Ubuntu 11.10 and can run it by typing "spyder" in terminal.  I would like to have it as an icon in my launcher instead.  How do I do that?
2011-11-21T21:03:00.000Z	pangur		it is an ide
2011-11-21T21:05:00.000Z	pangur		 /me tries vibhav's advice
2011-11-21T21:06:00.000Z	pangur		OK, that worked, thanks, vibhav :)
2011-11-21T21:06:00.000Z	pangur		Vibhav, supplementary question: Can I edit the icon that was generated?
2011-11-21T21:08:00.000Z	pangur		Is there a way of editing/replacing icons in launcher?
2011-11-21T21:08:00.000Z	SeaWookie	pangur	try system, preferences, main menu

2011-11-21T21:12:00.000Z	pangur		To be honest, I preferred the classic ubuntu to this dash stuff.
2011-11-21T21:13:00.000Z	pangur		I was scared to say in case I offended someone.
2011-11-21T21:13:00.000Z	SeaWookie	pangur	ah ok you have unity
2011-11-21T21:14:00.000Z	pangur		Yeah Unity.
2011-11-21T21:14:00.000Z	pangur		However, I am eager to move to something more intuitive for me.
