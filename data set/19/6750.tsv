2008-07-23T02:22:00.000Z	boobsbr		is there an app to make screencaps of a video on linux]? like wmp classic does?
2008-07-23T02:23:00.000Z	go1	boobsbr	something like recordmydesktop might work.
2008-07-23T02:23:00.000Z	boobsbr	go1	no no, open a video file and take screencaps of it at regular intervals
2008-07-23T02:25:00.000Z	go1	boobsbr	Do you mean a scheduled recording?
2008-07-23T02:25:00.000Z	boobsbr	go1	no, i have a video file, i would like to generate thumbnails from it, to make a preview
2008-07-23T02:27:00.000Z	boobsbr	go1	maybe a plugin for mplayer
2008-07-23T02:27:00.000Z	go1	boobsbr	I take it you don't want to write any code?
2008-07-23T02:28:00.000Z	boobsbr	go1	i'm looking for a quick solution, a script perhaps?
2008-07-23T02:28:00.000Z	go1	boobsbr	What are you going to use this for?
2008-07-23T02:30:00.000Z	boobsbr	go1	create a preview of a video we're going to show on the company, and send the imagefile to emplyees' email
2008-07-23T02:30:00.000Z	boobsbr	go1	my boss asked for it and here i am trying to figure out a way
2008-07-23T02:31:00.000Z	boobsbr	go1	well, that would work too
2008-07-23T02:31:00.000Z	boobsbr	go1	separate imgfiles or one imgfile with the smaller thumbs on it, either way would work
2008-07-23T02:32:00.000Z	go1	boobsbr	so you want to tile the images.
2008-07-23T02:32:00.000Z	boobsbr	go1	yeah, that would be the original idea
2008-07-23T02:33:00.000Z	boobsbr	go1	well, i found mplayerthumbs, but it's for kde file managers
2008-07-23T02:33:00.000Z	go1	boobsbr	you might be stuck with just creating a slideshow.
2008-07-23T02:34:00.000Z	go1	boobsbr	If you have enough disk space you could install KDE temporaraly.
2008-07-23T02:35:00.000Z	boobsbr	go1	yeah, i think it's about time i tried it again. haven't used it since opensuse 10.2
