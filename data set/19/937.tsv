2011-10-24T04:21:00.000Z	darius		it shows the isntall button but when i press install nothing at all happens. normally it asks for my password.
2011-10-24T04:22:00.000Z	darius		can you help me zykotick?
2011-10-24T04:23:00.000Z	zykotick9	darius	are you able to install from terminal?  "sudo apt-get install foo" is the problem ONLY with software center?
2011-10-24T04:24:00.000Z	darius	zykotick9	ive never tried to install from terminal i didnt know the command
2011-10-24T04:26:00.000Z	darius	zykotick9	this is what i get when i do that command "Reading package lists... Done
2011-10-24T04:26:00.000Z	zykotick9	darius	replace "foo" with the program name you actually want to install
2011-10-24T04:27:00.000Z	zykotick9	darius	the package name
2011-10-24T04:29:00.000Z	zykotick9	darius	what are you trying to install?
2011-10-24T04:30:00.000Z	darius	zykotick9	i was trying to install java for minecraft and adobe flash
2011-10-24T04:30:00.000Z	zykotick9	darius	try ubuntu-restricted-extras then
2011-10-24T04:31:00.000Z	zykotick9	darius	"sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras" type thing
2011-10-24T04:32:00.000Z	darius	zykotick9	its installing, does that mean its a error with the software centre?
2011-10-24T04:32:00.000Z	zykotick9	darius	probably.  sorry i have no ideas on fixing software center.  good luck.
2011-10-24T04:33:00.000Z	darius	zykotick9	well since its a problem with that, how do i find the package name to do this for all the packages i want?
2011-10-24T04:34:00.000Z	zykotick9	darius	you can use "apt-cache search foo" to search on command line
2011-10-24T04:36:00.000Z	zykotick9	darius	tab and enter key (probably)
2011-10-24T04:40:00.000Z	zykotick9	darius	I have no idea?  sorry.  try "sudo apt-get -f install" in a terminal perhaps.
2011-10-24T05:12:00.000Z	zykotick9	darius	"apt-cache search chromium"
