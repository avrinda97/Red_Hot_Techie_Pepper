2008-04-13T20:44:00.000Z	tgelter		I'm looking to get wake-on-wan working, wake-on-lan is set up and functional, but if I send the magic packet from outside my LAN, it's getting dropped/improperly forwarded by my router. Any suggests?
2008-04-13T20:46:00.000Z	unop	tgelter	what kind of router is this?
2008-04-13T20:46:00.000Z	tgelter	unop	D-link DI-624
2008-04-13T20:48:00.000Z	unop	tgelter	i don't know if this will be possible with your router, unless you can run some type of script on it that can be called to wake up the machine in the LAN
2008-04-13T20:48:00.000Z	tgelter	unop	is that because most routers drop multicast udp packets?
2008-04-13T20:49:00.000Z	tgelter	unop	I have a web-based adminstration tool available on port 8080 coming from the router, but I don't see any way that I could run a script using it
2008-04-13T20:50:00.000Z	unop	tgelter	iirc, WOL sends a magic layer-2 frame to a broadcast address (ff:ff:ff:ff:ff) -- and it's kinda impossible to send layer-2 traffic to a remote destination over the internet
2008-04-13T20:50:00.000Z	tgelter	unop	the idea I had was for the packet to be sent to broadcast and therefor be sent to all connected devices
2008-04-13T20:52:00.000Z	unop	tgelter	right, thats how WOL works anyway, but you can't send broadcast traffic over the internet
2008-04-13T20:52:00.000Z	tgelter	unop	ah, I didn't know that. so what are you suggesting I try?
2008-04-13T20:53:00.000Z	tgelter	unop	or what do people usually try if they want to wake up a machine over WAN? just log into a local machine to the one they want to wake up and send the magic packet from there?
2008-04-13T20:53:00.000Z	unop	tgelter	my router is actually a linux machine, and i've set it upto run a script whenever i access a particular URL on it's webserver, the script then wakes up computer(s)
2008-04-13T20:54:00.000Z	tgelter	unop	yeah, I've thought of doing that, though it'd be nice if I could just have the router up as I don't have an extra machine and the point of wake-on-wan (in my case) would be to wake up the desktop when I need to access it
2008-04-13T20:55:00.000Z	unop	tgelter	yea, it kind is a limitation of SOHO routers ..
2008-04-13T20:56:00.000Z	tgelter	unop	define SOHO please
2008-04-13T20:56:00.000Z	unop	tgelter	small office and home
2008-04-13T20:56:00.000Z	tgelter	unop	thanks
2008-04-13T20:56:00.000Z	tgelter	unop	and thanks for clearing up the muddy water for me
