2009-01-21T19:00:00.000Z	centoasa		Hi everybody
2009-01-21T19:01:00.000Z	centoasa		my network manager don't accept static IP
2009-01-21T19:01:00.000Z	centoasa		it's normal?
2009-01-21T19:01:00.000Z	centoasa		I'm chatting form Italy
2009-01-21T19:01:00.000Z	sipior	centoasa	afraid so. i understand the latest version allows for static IPs (long overdue...)
2009-01-21T19:02:00.000Z	centoasa		in fact I've 8.10
2009-01-21T19:02:00.000Z	sipior	centoasa	yes, but 8.10 doesn't have the latest network manager
2009-01-21T19:02:00.000Z	centoasa		wht's the latest network manager?
2009-01-21T19:02:00.000Z	sipior	centoasa	http://projects.gnome.org/NetworkManager/
2009-01-21T19:03:00.000Z	centoasa		can I upgrade network manager from within Ubuntu?
2009-01-21T19:04:00.000Z	sipior	centoasa	is it so important? you can use the network configuration dialogue to set up a static network. i agree it's not ideal. of course, you could always build a new network manager, but building gnome apps is a special form of pain...
2009-01-21T19:05:00.000Z	centoasa	sipior	you say it's better dhcp instead static IP?
2009-01-21T19:05:00.000Z	sipior	centoasa	no, i said you can configure a static ip from within the networking dialogue
2009-01-21T19:06:00.000Z	sipior	centoasa	or just modify /etc/network/interfaces by hand. the syntax is pretty easy to follow, and is documented in "man interfaces"
2009-01-21T19:07:00.000Z	centoasa		siprior, can you help me step by step to configure static ip?
2009-01-21T19:08:00.000Z	sipior	centoasa	sure, although, if you've already got dhcp working...
2009-01-21T19:09:00.000Z	centoasa		I'm click right: modify connection
2009-01-21T19:10:00.000Z	sipior	centoasa	actually, have a look here: http://www.ubuntugeek.com/how-to-set-a-static-ip-address-in-ubuntu-810-intrepid-ibex.html
2009-01-21T19:11:00.000Z	centoasa	sipior	great! I'm trying it
