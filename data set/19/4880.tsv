2008-10-18T15:36:00.000Z	zhaozhou_	william__	sits blank as in just dies, or sits blank as in runs, but no output?
2008-10-18T15:37:00.000Z	zhaozhou_	william__	You could install strace and do strace gnome-do to see what it's actually doing
2008-10-18T15:40:00.000Z	zhaozhou_	william__	you could do that in Xdefaults
2008-10-18T15:40:00.000Z	zhaozhou_	william__	*geometry 80x25 for example, in ~/.Xdefaults
2008-10-18T15:41:00.000Z	zhaozhou_	william__	No idea if that applies to gnome-terminal though, i'm using it for urxvt.
2008-10-18T15:43:00.000Z	zhaozhou_	william__	which one did you use?
2008-10-18T15:51:00.000Z	zhaozhou_	william__	Hah, you have a point there
2008-10-18T15:54:00.000Z	zhaozhou_	william__	You will have problems with user rights if you use ntfs, but it works.
2008-10-18T15:58:00.000Z	zhaozhou_	william__	gotta love last.fm
