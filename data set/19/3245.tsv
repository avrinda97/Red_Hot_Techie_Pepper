2009-10-26T17:50:00.000Z	sahilsk		i  need to install ubuntu from pendrive.
2009-10-26T17:50:00.000Z	sahilsk		how can i??
2009-10-26T17:51:00.000Z	sahilsk		i've tried using unetbootin. But when i reboot my computer and boot from pendrive, it say : can't find ntdlr
2009-10-26T17:51:00.000Z	elginix	sahilsk	it's probably not botting from usb
2009-10-26T17:53:00.000Z	sahilsk	elginix	any solution to this??
2009-10-26T17:54:00.000Z	elginix	sahilsk	probably want to check your bios settings - it sounds its still trying to boot from hdd (i assume you run windows)
2009-10-26T17:54:00.000Z	elginix	sahilsk	and check which device is booted from
2009-10-26T17:55:00.000Z	sahilsk	elginix	yes,. i've enabled boot option for usb too. I choose the usb hdd for booting. even than it show me "can't find ntdlr".  I am using window currently..as i 've no option ..:(
2009-10-26T17:55:00.000Z	sahilsk		:(
2009-10-26T17:55:00.000Z	elginix	sahilsk	the ntldr message sounds like its looking for windows boot loader
2009-10-26T17:56:00.000Z	elginix	sahilsk	do you only have one partition on your pendrive?
2009-10-26T17:57:00.000Z	sahilsk		yes,it's only 4gb...I have ubuntu iinstalled in my computer, but widow has overwrite its grub loader. But i want a fresh iintallation over it.
2009-10-26T17:58:00.000Z	elginix	sahilsk	windows overwrote the grub loader on your hdd?
2009-10-26T17:58:00.000Z	sahilsk		yes
2009-10-26T17:59:00.000Z	elginix	sahilsk	might be worth running a livecd version and trying to install to usb from that
2009-10-26T18:03:00.000Z	sahilsk	elginix	actually i don't have cd rom..this is the  problem :(
2009-10-26T18:03:00.000Z	elginix	sahilsk	ahh ok :) do you have another machine you can install to usb from?
2009-10-26T18:04:00.000Z	sahilsk	elginix	but i have iso files in my computer.
2009-10-26T18:06:00.000Z	elginix	sahilsk	bit of a catch 22 - i think i'd just try to download the iso on another machine and run unetbootin on there - even a windows machine can create a ubuntu bootstick
