2007-10-06T14:08:00.000Z	adrien		Help, I'm on Ubuntu with a 320x200x8bit screen res, need to reconfigure x after addition of graphics card.
2007-10-06T14:10:00.000Z	adrien		xconf didn't work and I'm on irssi right now, so I don't know what else was suggested.
2007-10-06T14:12:00.000Z	MasterShrek	adrien	what card is it?
2007-10-06T14:13:00.000Z	adrien	MasterShrek	It's an Intel graphics chip, that's what lspci says.
2007-10-06T14:13:00.000Z	MasterShrek	adrien	apt-get install 915resolution
2007-10-06T14:14:00.000Z	adrien	MasterShrek	What will the driver name be so I can set it in xorg.conf?

2007-10-06T14:18:00.000Z	MasterShrek	adrien	im not sure what driver you should use, maybe i855 or intel
2007-10-06T14:19:00.000Z	adrien	MasterShrek	What other suggestion did you have? I tried i855, but got nothing.
2007-10-06T14:20:00.000Z	adrien	MasterShrek	Thanks for your help. I'm gonna search about on lynx then
2007-10-06T14:21:00.000Z	MasterShrek	adrien	u can use the vesa driver to get a gui prolly
2007-10-06T14:21:00.000Z	adrien	MasterShrek	When I tried vesa, it got me nothing. I took that as a generally bad sign.
2007-10-06T14:22:00.000Z	MasterShrek	adrien	yea id say, lspci -vv should give you more information about what card i tis
2007-10-06T14:24:00.000Z	adrien	MasterShrek	It says, 00:01.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation 82810 CGC [Chipset Graphics Controller]  (rev 03) (prog-if 00 [VGA] )
2007-10-06T14:25:00.000Z	MasterShrek	adrien	that should help you to find out info on that card, 82810
