2008-12-07T04:54:00.000Z	nemo		Say, if I want to do hibernation, does that mean I need 2 swap partitions, one for normal use, and one, the size of my memory, for swsup?
2008-12-07T04:54:00.000Z	nemo		or is all this automatic nowdays? (I'm installing ubuntu on my first notebook)
2008-12-07T04:55:00.000Z	nemo		you'd think the swap, if in use, would not do well on resuming if it was overwritten with memory
2008-12-07T04:56:00.000Z	nemo		would hibernation simply fail?
2008-12-07T04:57:00.000Z	matreya6	nemo	it happens on my box as well, I use a spanking new Asus P5Q with Intel E8400 Core 2 Duo
2008-12-07T05:05:00.000Z	matreya6	nemo	regarding SAP, you can use the Java 710r6 client
2008-12-07T05:06:00.000Z	nemo	matreya6	hm. that's the R3 right?
2008-12-07T05:06:00.000Z	matreya6	nemo	no, NetWeaver
2008-12-07T05:06:00.000Z	nemo	matreya6	riiight. but isn't that revision the one for R3? :)
2008-12-07T05:06:00.000Z	matreya6	nemo	but it is also compatible with R/ 3 yes
2008-12-07T05:07:00.000Z	nemo	matreya6	ah. not requireed though. ok. cool. still learning SAP.  only thing I know is that R3 requires 4GiB of memory and the client isn't on it anyway.
2008-12-07T05:07:00.000Z	nemo	matreya6	amusingly SAP is not terribly windows compatible from my exp in the training class :)
2008-12-07T05:08:00.000Z	matreya6	nemo	yes that was a hoot indeed. All people struggling, while I had my setup ready on my Macbook in say.. 2 minutes :-D
2008-12-07T05:09:00.000Z	nemo	matreya6	oh!!! it works on OSX??
2008-12-07T05:09:00.000Z	nemo	matreya6	sweeeet.  you'll make 2 students very very happy
2008-12-07T05:09:00.000Z	matreya6	nemo	Oh yes, like a charm
2008-12-07T05:10:00.000Z	nemo	matreya6	what I found hilarious was I was the only student to get it installed on my newly donated notebook.  I, who have hardly any windows exp
2008-12-07T05:10:00.000Z	matreya6	nemo	as a matter of fact, I'm writing a tutorial how to get SAP working on linux and OsX, care to receive a copy when I have finished it?
2008-12-07T05:10:00.000Z	nemo	matreya6	sending you pm to stop hogging channel if you don't mind
