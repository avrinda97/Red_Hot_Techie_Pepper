2005-04-20T15:39:00.000Z	tkz		Is there a repository from which I could get a newer version of wireless-tools package than the one that's default in Hoary?
2005-04-20T15:39:00.000Z	stuNNed	tkz	why do you need newer tools? sure it's not your driver?
2005-04-20T15:40:00.000Z	tkz	stuNNed	I had NetworkManager working in Warty. The key then was to upgrade wireless-tools. Now apt-get says I have newest version but the "radar" does not show up and can't use the wlan in Hoary
2005-04-20T15:41:00.000Z	stuNNed	tkz	ah, NetworkManager, don't know about that one, I've tried to get it working but couldn't so gave up :)
2005-04-20T15:42:00.000Z	tkz	stuNNed	have you found some other nice way to switch between wireless networks?
2005-04-20T15:43:00.000Z	stuNNed	tkz	like on the fly?  not really, i usually do 'iwconfig wlan0 essid "SSID" ; dhclient wlan0 ; /etc/init.d/ipkungfu restart' so no :)
2005-04-20T15:43:00.000Z	stuNNed	tkz	or use network-admin, they should show up there if the SSID's are published.
2005-04-20T15:44:00.000Z	tkz	stuNNed	huh... complicated...  ...with Warty and NetworkManger I was able to just click on the network I wanted to use and *blim* I was in the net
2005-04-20T15:45:00.000Z	stuNNed	tkz	yeah, something more 'on the fly' would be nice as default in ubuntu :)
2005-04-20T15:46:00.000Z	tkz	stuNNed	yep... I guess I'll try to get the NetworkManager running....
2005-04-20T15:48:00.000Z	stuNNed	tkz	i'm sure you know about http://people.ubuntu.com/~thom/network-manager/ right?  but that's the one i couldn't get working
2005-04-20T15:49:00.000Z	tkz	stuNNed	yes that is how I got it running in Warty, plus I had to upgrade wireless-tools. No luck in Hoary though
2005-04-20T15:50:00.000Z	stuNNed	tkz	afaik i tried it the other day in Hoary, no luck here either :(
2005-04-20T15:57:00.000Z	tkz	stuNNed	I think I will try to compile the NetworkManager from source and see how that goes. I'll let you know in a while
2005-04-20T15:58:00.000Z	stuNNed	tkz	that would be great
2005-04-21T16:07:00.000Z	tkz	stuNNed	interesting... the ./configure complains "configure: error: iwlib.h not found. Install wireless-tools" even though I have wireless-tools installed...
2005-04-21T16:07:00.000Z	stuNNed	tkz	there is way to install source in debian but i have no clue :)
2005-04-21T16:42:00.000Z	tkz	stuNNed	didn't get NetworkManager to work but check out http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=25398
2005-04-21T16:43:00.000Z	tkz	stuNNed	...atleast I got my wlan running with that. Had to a slight modification to the code though
