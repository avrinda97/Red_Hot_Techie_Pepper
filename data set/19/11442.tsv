2006-08-29T08:01:00.000Z	dfd	sekhar	-- you still haven't asked anything
2006-08-29T08:01:00.000Z	sekhar	dfd	i upgraded ubuntu breezy to dapper yesterday
2006-08-29T08:03:00.000Z	dfd	sekhar	-- what do you mean? You had it but now it isn't there anymore?
2006-08-29T08:03:00.000Z	dfd	sekhar	-- Have you tried reinstalling it?
2006-08-29T08:03:00.000Z	sekhar	dfd	exactly
2006-08-29T08:04:00.000Z	dfd	sekhar	-- exec gksu synaptic
2006-08-29T08:04:00.000Z	dfd	sekhar	-- then select openoffice from the list and click on apply
2006-08-29T08:06:00.000Z	sekhar	dfd	should i search for open office
2006-08-29T08:07:00.000Z	dfd	sekhar	-- yes, openoffice. It is in the list
2006-08-29T08:07:00.000Z	dfd	sekhar	-- check it and then click on apply to installing it and all its dependency packages
2006-08-29T08:08:00.000Z	sekhar	dfd	under open office there are a lot of files
2006-08-29T08:09:00.000Z	dfd	sekhar	-- just select "openoffice", it will automatically select all the main components
2006-08-29T08:12:00.000Z	sekhar	dfd	thanx
2006-08-29T08:13:00.000Z	dfd	sekhar	-- no problem, does it work?
2006-08-29T08:13:00.000Z	sekhar	dfd	one more doubt
2006-08-29T08:14:00.000Z	sekhar	dfd	when i log in as root in the dapper there is no synaptic and update manager also but breezy it was there
2006-08-29T08:16:00.000Z	dfd	sekhar	-- you do login as root? Better using sudo.. but anyway.. where do you don't see synaptic and update manager? From the gnome menus?
