2006-07-25T09:23:00.000Z	BarryAllen		hi all
2006-07-25T09:24:00.000Z	BarryAllen		im trying to use my radeon 9100 / igp (mobile), without success in dapper, ... the kernel module is up... my driver in xorg.conf is "radeon" but i got the message in the Xorg.log (II) RADEON(0): [agp]  You may want to make sure the agpgart kernel module
2006-07-25T09:24:00.000Z	BarryAllen		is loaded before the radeon kernel module.
2006-07-25T09:25:00.000Z	Enverex	BarryAllen	Does it work with the fglrx module? (ATi's official driver)
2006-07-25T09:25:00.000Z	BarryAllen	Enverex	i tried that, but the oficcial doc, says, my chipset (igp), does not support 3d....
2006-07-25T09:27:00.000Z	Enverex	BarryAllen	Well if the official Doc says it doesn't support 3D then 3D isn't going to work with any driver is it, lol
2006-07-25T09:29:00.000Z	Enverex	BarryAllen	DRM != 3D support...
2006-07-25T09:30:00.000Z	Enverex	BarryAllen	(you said enraGe  last time btw)
2006-07-25T09:30:00.000Z	BarryAllen	Enverex	: so sorry, im trying to have dri
2006-07-25T09:32:00.000Z	Enverex	BarryAllen	All I had to do to get my ATi mobility working was install the ATi driver with Synaptic and change the xorg.conf file to use fglrx instead of radeon
2006-07-25T09:32:00.000Z	BarryAllen	Enverex	i tried fglrx but.... fglrxinfo dont reports use of dri
2006-07-25T09:33:00.000Z	Enverex	BarryAllen	Do you have dri enabled in the xorg.conf file?
2006-07-25T09:33:00.000Z	BarryAllen	Enverex	yes ... i have dri and glx in the  modules section
2006-07-25T09:33:00.000Z	Enverex	BarryAllen	 Does the xorg log file explain any errors?
2006-07-25T09:34:00.000Z	Enverex	BarryAllen	radeon doesn't support hardware 3d accelleration anyway afaik
2006-07-25T09:40:00.000Z	Enverex	BarryAllen	I'm using a Mobility 9000 so I don't see why this would be so different for you
