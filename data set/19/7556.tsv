2007-08-04T08:27:00.000Z	TimK65_		Well, using "sudo dhclient ra0" got my interface connected and running, I have Internet connectivity. Now I just need to add back wireless security. ShackJack, you suggested reinstalling wpasupplicant. If I do that, what effect am I looking for? Should WPA start showing up as an option in networkmanager or in Wireless - Properties?
2007-08-04T08:27:00.000Z	rausb0	TimK65_	ralink drivers do not work with wpa_supplicant
2007-08-04T08:28:00.000Z	TimK65_	rausb0	so I'm screwed with this card?
2007-08-04T08:28:00.000Z	rausb0	TimK65_	you have to use several iwpriv commands to configure wpa with the ralink driver
2007-08-04T08:28:00.000Z	TimK65_	rausb0	is this on the WPA Howto page?
2007-08-04T08:28:00.000Z	rausb0	TimK65_	which card / driver do you have exactly?
2007-08-04T08:29:00.000Z	rausb0	TimK65_	not the drivers on the cd
2007-08-04T08:29:00.000Z	rausb0	TimK65_	the driver linux loaded
2007-08-04T08:29:00.000Z	rausb0	TimK65_	something like rt61 or rt2500 or ...
2007-08-04T08:31:00.000Z	rausb0	TimK65_	alright, so it is the rt61 driver. just a moment.
2007-08-04T08:33:00.000Z	rausb0	TimK65_	which encryption type do you need?
2007-08-04T08:33:00.000Z	TimK65_	rausb0	I was using WPA Personal. This is just a home network.
2007-08-04T08:35:00.000Z	rausb0	TimK65_	okay, so you need the following commands: iwpriv ra0 set NetworkType=Infra ;  iwpriv ra0 set AuthMode=WPAPSK ; iwpriv ra0 set EncrypType=TKIP ; iwpriv ra0 set SSID="YOUR_SSID" ; iwpriv ra0 set WPAPSK="YOUR_WPA_PASSWORD" ; iwpriv ra0 set SSID="YOUR_SSID"
2007-08-04T08:35:00.000Z	TimK65_	rausb0	thanks -- where do these commands go?
2007-08-04T08:35:00.000Z	rausb0	TimK65_	the duplicate setting of SSID is not a mistake
2007-08-04T08:36:00.000Z	rausb0	TimK65_	first, try if the commands work
2007-08-04T08:36:00.000Z	rausb0	TimK65_	you have to run them with root privs
2007-08-04T08:36:00.000Z	TimK65_	rausb0	OK, will try here in a moment. Must reestablish security on my network first. Thanks.
2007-08-04T08:37:00.000Z	rausb0	TimK65_	you can't wpasupplicant anyway with this card. believe me.
