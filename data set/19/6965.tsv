2008-04-24T09:44:00.000Z	DAC1138		can someone explain why openoffice has a patch (that's about 100+ mb) each week?
2008-04-24T09:45:00.000Z	tcpdumpgod	DAC1138	security fixes and functionality fixes
2008-04-24T09:48:00.000Z	DAC1138	tcpdumpgod	then wouldnt it be better to just download openoffice from the main site and not worry about having to get the debs from the ubuntu servers, since they're so buggy and holey?
2008-04-24T09:48:00.000Z	tcpdumpgod	DAC1138	the .deb's from ubuntu are .deb made from the patches Openoffice puts out.
2008-04-24T09:49:00.000Z	DAC1138	tcpdumpgod	ah, ok. well, it just gets frusturating when we have bandwidth caps here in australia and we have 500 updates to get to make a distro stable
2008-04-24T09:50:00.000Z	tcpdumpgod	DAC1138	are you talking about because you have multiple machines to update or because openoffice updates so often?
2008-04-24T09:50:00.000Z	tcpdumpgod	DAC1138	are you using dapper or what?
2008-04-24T09:50:00.000Z	DAC1138	tcpdumpgod	been using gutsy for the longest time but gave up on doing updates about 3 months ago
2008-04-24T09:51:00.000Z	tcpdumpgod		why DAC1138 ?
2008-04-24T09:51:00.000Z	DAC1138	tcpdumpgod	thought this new hardy release candidate would have improved the update thing, but it didnt.
2008-04-24T09:51:00.000Z	DAC1138	tcpdumpgod	updates are tedious and stupid when they update apps i don't even use, and even if it's for security purposes, i'd rather just deal with a broken system than spend my uptime downloading updates
2008-04-24T09:51:00.000Z	tcpdumpgod	DAC1138	do you have "hardy" in your sources.list or "gutsy"?
2008-04-24T09:52:00.000Z	DAC1138	tcpdumpgod	it's all hardy now
2008-04-24T09:53:00.000Z	tcpdumpgod		How long have you had it like that DAC1138 ?
2008-04-24T09:53:00.000Z	DAC1138	tcpdumpgod	installed the hardy beta and im not installing anything else, since ubuntu is the best (just tried openoffice 10.3, it's not to shabby, but not ubuntu)
2008-04-24T09:53:00.000Z	tcpdumpgod		How long have you had it like that DAC1138 ?
2008-04-24T09:53:00.000Z	DAC1138	tcpdumpgod	hardy repos? since i installed the hardy RC
2008-04-24T09:54:00.000Z	tcpdumpgod	DAC1138	a week, two weeks, ?!
2008-04-24T09:54:00.000Z	DAC1138	tcpdumpgod	a day
