2011-05-05T08:33:00.000Z	edbian	Guest7301	What card do you have?
2011-05-05T08:34:00.000Z	edbian	Guest7301	What driver do you have?  What have you used?  What would you like to use?
2011-05-05T08:35:00.000Z	Guest7301	edbian	the driver that says recomended
2011-05-05T08:36:00.000Z	Guest7301	edbian	it says that it is active but not in use
2011-05-05T08:36:00.000Z	edbian	Guest7301	hang on
2011-05-05T08:39:00.000Z	edbian	Guest7301	You can use sudo lspci -k to see which driver is really being used.  That gui app is buggy and often lies
2011-05-05T08:41:00.000Z	Guest7301	edbian	nvidia-173
2011-05-05T08:42:00.000Z	edbian	Guest7301	That's a proprietary driver.  Here is a list of all packages that contain drivers for nvidia.  I'm not sure of the difference between 173 and 96 and such but nouveau is the open source driver
2011-05-05T08:45:00.000Z	Guest7301	edbian	"Kernel modules: nvidia-173, nvidia-current, nouveau, nvidiafb"
2011-05-05T08:45:00.000Z	edbian	Guest7301	Is that a question?
2011-05-05T08:46:00.000Z	Guest7301	edbian	hmmm, that's what i saw
2011-05-05T08:46:00.000Z	edbian	Guest7301	That seems fine.  You're using nvidia-173.  It's a proprietary driver.  I'm not clear what the issue is here
2011-05-05T08:47:00.000Z	Guest7301	edbian	it says that the driver is activated but not currently in use
2011-05-05T08:47:00.000Z	Guest7301	edbian	and my windows are messed up
2011-05-05T08:47:00.000Z	edbian	Guest7301	The gui app is lying.
2011-05-05T08:48:00.000Z	Guest7301	edbian	i can;t move or drag my windows
2011-05-05T08:48:00.000Z	edbian	Guest7301	Try sudo apt-get purge nvidia-173 then restart. This will remove the nvidia-173 driver which will force the system to use nouveau.  See if that fixes it.
