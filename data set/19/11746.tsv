2005-12-11T08:20:00.000Z	pinkisntwell		i get no sound from mplayer except if i start it from the cli. what the hell?
2005-12-11T08:22:00.000Z	pinkisntwell		yes but I would like to see why this happens, too
2005-12-11T08:22:00.000Z	pinkisntwell		it's supposed to be the best player and all
2005-12-11T08:23:00.000Z	pinkisntwell		if I start from the Applications menu it says it can't initialize audio and hence gives no sound
2005-12-11T08:23:00.000Z	pinkisntwell		if i start from the cli i get audio
2005-12-11T08:24:00.000Z	pinkisntwell		yes
2005-12-11T08:24:00.000Z	dabaR	pinkisntwell	its a setting
2006-01-06T12:29:00.000Z	dabaR	pinkisntwell	suckazzz!!! joking. How did you install 1.5?
2006-01-06T12:31:00.000Z	dabaR	pinkisntwell	use epiphany.
2006-01-06T12:31:00.000Z	dabaR	pinkisntwell	your issue seems workable. Go System>Pref>Preffs Progs, and point the browser to your copy.
2006-01-06T12:33:00.000Z	dabaR	pinkisntwell	and you never even tried whether it was slow for you?
2006-01-06T12:33:00.000Z	dabaR	pinkisntwell	go do what I told you, and ask if you need more info.
2006-01-06T12:33:00.000Z	pinkisntwell	dabaR	it works, thank you
2006-01-06T12:34:00.000Z	pinkisntwell	dabaR	I tried it for a month (since I installed ubuntu), it's immensely slow
2006-01-06T14:08:00.000Z	dabaR	pinkisntwell	where did you see that.
2006-01-06T14:08:00.000Z	pinkisntwell	dabaR	kalimera. I saw it in dpkg-divert
2006-01-06T14:09:00.000Z	dabaR	pinkisntwell	"man dpkg-divert"
2006-01-06T14:09:00.000Z	pinkisntwell	dabaR	I read it and don't understand
2006-01-06T14:09:00.000Z	dabaR	pinkisntwell	then it is not something you need, or is it?
