2010-10-03T23:45:00.000Z	tron__		i have accidently deleted files on one of my partitions...how can i recover the data?
2010-10-03T23:46:00.000Z	mkenya	tron__	depends on what type of data
2010-10-03T23:46:00.000Z	tron__	mkenya	music, pictures and videos
2010-10-03T23:49:00.000Z	mkenya	tron__	i know  some windows tools for windows partition that do good for pictures and videos but music not yet which filing syst did u use for th lost one/
2010-10-03T23:49:00.000Z	tron__	mkenya	ext4
2010-10-03T23:50:00.000Z	mkenya	tron__	i know theres a perticular linux for that job try wikipedia for it dont remember its name and i havent used it but its fairly good i think
2010-10-03T23:51:00.000Z	tron__	mkenya	is there any application in repos that I can use??
2010-10-03T23:53:00.000Z	mkenya	tron__	well let me check
2010-10-03T23:53:00.000Z	tron__	mkenya	ok
2010-10-04T00:16:00.000Z	tron__	mkenya	e2undel is for ext2 only. I searched for unrm it gave me 'tct' - Post mortem analysis of unix systems - Forensic tools
2010-10-04T00:20:00.000Z	mkenya	tron__	i know but it wax for document files if you know programing i guess u can modify the source code and for unrm it may work i havent tried either but if i am using linux i avoid ext fiing sytem for my media files try vfat its cheaper and easier for media files
2010-10-04T00:21:00.000Z	tron__	mkenya	i am just an end user, i have no programming knowledge. Though I found some info about Testdisk on stack exchange and I am trying to use it )
2010-10-04T00:22:00.000Z	tron__	mkenya	its in repos
2010-10-04T00:23:00.000Z	tron__	mkenya	ubuntu

2010-10-04T00:30:00.000Z	mkenya	tron__	let me test it ave got it now
2010-10-04T00:30:00.000Z	tron__	mkenya	ok :)
2010-10-04T00:38:00.000Z	tron__	mkenya	hmm...I have switched to ubuntu completely. Anyway I am reading testdisk wiki hopefully I will find something
