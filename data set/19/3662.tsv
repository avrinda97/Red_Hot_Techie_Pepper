2010-04-21T20:42:00.000Z	gemilang		Dr_willis, i find cheese in update manager?
2010-04-21T20:42:00.000Z	moreia	gemilang	you find cheese in synatpic
2010-04-21T20:42:00.000Z	moreia	gemilang	sorry. Synaptic.
2010-04-21T20:42:00.000Z	gemilang	moreia	okay thanks so much
2010-04-21T20:45:00.000Z	moreia	gemilang	what version are you running?
2010-04-21T20:46:00.000Z	moreia	gemilang	and cheese doesn't show up in synaptic?
2010-04-21T20:47:00.000Z	moreia	gemilang	have you done some tweaking to your sources list?
2010-04-21T20:48:00.000Z	gemilang	moreia	im not sure i do that, because my desktop used by many person in my house
2010-04-21T20:49:00.000Z	gemilang	moreia	i have open your link, then what should i do?
2010-04-21T20:50:00.000Z	moreia	gemilang	You probably want to pastebin the contents of /etc/apt/sources.list
2010-04-21T20:51:00.000Z	moreia	gemilang	per that list, Cheese should be in the standard repostitories since Hardy, (9.04 is Jaunty, i think) so if searching in Synaptic doesn't turn anything up the next step is to make sure the source hasn't been disabled.
2010-04-21T20:52:00.000Z	moreia	gemilang	but: are you able to launch synaptic and search for other software to install?
2010-04-21T20:53:00.000Z	gemilang	moreia	yes i am able to do that
2010-04-21T20:53:00.000Z	moreia	gemilang	so then the next step is to look at sources.list
2010-04-21T20:54:00.000Z	gemilang	moreia	okay
2010-04-21T20:55:00.000Z	moreia	gemilang	alternatively, you can look under Settings > Repositories in synaptic.
2010-04-21T20:56:00.000Z	gemilang	moreia	 hmm, repositories in synaptic. i will learn it first. okay
