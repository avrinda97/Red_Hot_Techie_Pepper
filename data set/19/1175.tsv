2011-04-26T06:30:00.000Z	eXscalate		hey guys... following question: windows 7 has the aero snap feature which makes it possible for users to just simply drag a window to the left or right and the windows get automatically resized to half of the screen. However you can also alternatively press the windows key plus left or right, which goes much faster. Now is there a possibility to make ubuntu do the same as soon as i push the super button plus left or right? I tried
2011-04-26T06:30:00.000Z	eXscalate		 to search online but there are only tutorials how to get it to snap the windows to the edge by dragging them... thanks guys for the help!
2011-04-26T06:32:00.000Z	soreau	eXscalate	Look into compiz grid plugin.. but it sounds like you might be using natty already?
2011-04-26T06:33:00.000Z	eXscalate	soreau	im using the latest stable version of ubuntu... so not the newly beta
2011-04-26T06:33:00.000Z	soreau	eXscalate	So you only have the keybindings available though you can hack compiz 0.8 to have the drag feature too
2011-04-26T06:34:00.000Z	soreau	eXscalate	If you're already running compiz (desktop effects), install compiz-fusion-plugins-extra
2011-04-26T06:34:00.000Z	soreau	eXscalate	and compizconfig-settings-managers, then look for Grid in Window Management category
2011-04-26T06:35:00.000Z	soreau	eXscalate	compizconfig-settings-manager*
2011-04-26T06:35:00.000Z	eXscalate	soreau	ok! i will do so! thx for that tip... another question: is it possible to safe all your compiz settings, so that if i completely reinstall ubuntu i can simply recover all my settings and programs?
2011-04-26T06:35:00.000Z	soreau	eXscalate	Yes but it will only work for that version of compiz
2011-04-26T06:35:00.000Z	soreau	eXscalate	ccsm>Preferences>Export (and Import to restore)
2011-04-26T06:38:00.000Z	eXscalate	soreau	but then i wont have also my programs backed up right? i mean like for example firefox 4...
2011-04-26T06:38:00.000Z	soreau	eXscalate	Maybe I didnt read your question right, lets see
2011-04-26T06:39:00.000Z	soreau	eXscalate	So save all settings, just backup/restore your entire home folder
2011-04-26T06:39:00.000Z	soreau		To*
2011-04-26T06:39:00.000Z	eXscalate	soreau	thanks! so afterwards i just paste it into the new system, right?
2011-04-26T06:40:00.000Z	soreau	eXscalate	The home folder, yes. Only do it for the same version of ubuntu though
2011-04-26T06:40:00.000Z	eXscalate	soreau	ok man! thanks a lot for the information!
2011-04-26T06:41:00.000Z	soreau	eXscalate	no problem
