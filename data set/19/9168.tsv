2007-06-04T07:26:00.000Z	doctorow		I would like to permanently disable Slow Keys on Kubuntu Feisty so that it never ever pops up a dialog asking me if I want to turn it on, no matter what keys I hold down
2007-06-04T07:26:00.000Z	doctorow		Is there a way to uninstall Slow Keys so that it's not even on my systems anymore?
2007-06-04T07:27:00.000Z	doctorow		Wilson -- yup!
2007-06-04T07:27:00.000Z	doctorow		At least, I'm wearing his underwear and using his computer!
2007-06-04T07:28:00.000Z	doctorow		w1ls0n, of course!
2007-06-04T07:29:00.000Z	doctorow		w1ls0n, though I have to tell you that I'm about ready to tear my hair out over Slow Keys turning on every time I hold down the shift key for 8 secs. I generally hold down the shift key whil eI'm thinking about what to type, fingers poised over the keyboard to start a new sentence. Inspiration strikes, I start typing, and all my keystrokes are stolen by
2007-06-04T07:30:00.000Z	doctorow		W1ls0n Slow Keys -- and then I have to minimize the top two windows to find the "Do you want Slow Keys" dialog and turn it off
2007-06-04T07:30:00.000Z	haggard	doctorow	have a look at this: http://www.bbc.co.uk/accessibility/linux/keyboard/keyboard_easy/tuning/tuning_response_gnome.shtml
2007-06-04T07:31:00.000Z	doctorow	haggard	thanks for that's not it -- I need to change the fact that Slow Keys -- even when disabled -- pops up a dialog if you hold down shift for 8+ secs and asks you if you want it turned on
2007-06-04T07:32:00.000Z	haggard	doctorow	ah, i see
2007-06-04T07:32:00.000Z	doctorow	haggard	I want to actually remove slow-keys, or at least get rid of the shortcut
2007-06-04T07:32:00.000Z	doctorow	haggard	Do you know what package Slow Keys comes with? I was thinking I could just uninstall that
2007-06-04T07:34:00.000Z	haggard	doctorow	i'm confused, why can't you just disable Slow Keys?
2007-06-04T07:35:00.000Z	doctorow	haggard	because when I hold down the shift key for 8+ seconds, it pops up a message asking me if I want to enable slow keys -- even if slow keys is disabled. This dialog is broken -- it shows up behind the current window and isn't listed in the alt-tab window list -- and until you hunt it down and click "No" it won't let you type ANYTHING
2007-06-04T07:36:00.000Z	doctorow	haggard	I just want to remove whatever package comes Slow Keys comes in
2007-06-04T07:39:00.000Z	haggard	doctorow	- i believe (although I'm not 100% sure) slow keys is part of gnome-accessibility
2007-06-04T07:40:00.000Z	haggard	doctorow	but i don't think you want to uninstall that
2007-06-04T07:42:00.000Z	haggard	doctorow	i have to go, but you might want to skim through here to see if offers any help: http://www.gnome.org/learn/access-guide/2.6/access-guide.html
2007-06-04T07:44:00.000Z	haggard	doctorow	try asking in #kubuntu
