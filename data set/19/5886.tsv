2008-07-10T02:44:00.000Z	unop	billgoldberg	hear him out before suggesting ndiswrapper :)  afterall, you should use ndiswrapper as a failover
2008-07-10T02:44:00.000Z	billgoldberg	unop	true
2008-07-10T02:58:00.000Z	unop	billgoldberg	why sudo? it might not need it
2008-07-10T02:59:00.000Z	unop	billgoldberg	err, no, it might be failing to start at alt+f2 for any number of reasons other than sudo --
2008-07-10T02:59:00.000Z	unop	billgoldberg	it's always best to know for sure why an application fails to start -- sudo can be dangerous, use it sparingly
2008-07-10T02:59:00.000Z	unop	billgoldberg	err, actually it can hurt
2008-07-10T03:00:00.000Z	unop	billgoldberg	let's say you recommend this now, and it works-- the person now assumes he needs to use sudo all the time -- so the next time, some sends him a script (that deletes X Y and Z)and he tries to invoke it through alt+f2 , he'll resort to sudo -- not good at all
2008-07-10T03:01:00.000Z	billgoldberg	unop	I know
2008-07-10T03:01:00.000Z	unop	billgoldberg	it might but then again, it might not -- what i am saying is, it is best to be sure and safe than to be _sorry_ later
2008-07-10T03:02:00.000Z	unop	billgoldberg	yes, i know what you are saying -- i'm saying it might not have needed to use sudo, it could have failed for any number of reasons
2008-07-10T03:02:00.000Z	unop	billgoldberg	that's even worse then :)
2008-07-10T03:28:00.000Z	billgoldberg	unop	but if the issue is with the commands he is entering, winff could be good for him; either wayn installing winff will take only a few seconds, it's worth a shot
2008-07-10T03:29:00.000Z	unop	billgoldberg	i just checked with him, ffmpeg does not have all it's capability, it can't encode aac when it should, it can't use xvid, etc -- so something is definitely wrong with ffmpeg
2008-07-10T03:31:00.000Z	unop	billgoldberg	err no, reinstalling is bad problem resolution :) find out why your app does not work before ditching it for a reinstall
2008-07-10T03:31:00.000Z	billgoldberg	unop	seriously, a reinstall could fix thing a lot faster. If a reinstall is an option that is
2008-07-10T03:31:00.000Z	unop	billgoldberg	i'm not saying, never do a reinstall --- it should be your very last option
2008-07-10T03:31:00.000Z	billgoldberg	unop	I don't agree
2008-07-10T03:32:00.000Z	unop	billgoldberg	then i don't want to hear what you have to say :) serisously
