2010-02-28T10:52:00.000Z	sabat		How can I tell if my wireless card is installed? os:u9.10 PC:MX6453 Gateway Laptop.
2010-02-28T10:52:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	sabat	pastebin your lspci -nnk
2010-02-28T10:55:00.000Z	sabat	psycho_oreos	the system is not connected to any network, kinda hard to do
2010-02-28T10:55:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	sabat	well are you able to save the output into a file onto something like USB stick and transfer the data across?
2010-02-28T10:56:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	sabat	you do realise that if it isn't connected to internet, installing drivers will be very hard to do?
2010-02-28T10:56:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	sabat	from where?
2010-02-28T10:58:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	sabat	if you can, try to get it hooked up to internet using cable or at the very least get the output of lspci -nnk into USB stick and paste the output on pastebin
2010-02-28T11:03:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	sabat	your device could either be missing the correct driver or firmware, but without you telling me the output of lspci -nnk you're making the assistance task very awkward
2010-02-28T11:05:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	sabat	you're missing firmware
2010-02-28T11:06:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	sabat	no firmware to run the device, wireless devices and other devices these days requires a firmware which is usually proprietary and not easily available without internet access and your consent to download proprietary stuff
2010-02-28T11:07:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	sabat	well unfortunately that's broadcrap for you, best yet is to physically hook that laptop up using wired and go through hardware drivers
2010-02-28T11:10:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	sabat	well you'll need some form of internet access on the laptop before you can do any other stuff with the laptop wirelessly
2010-02-28T11:11:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	sabat	make sure that you have an IP address on that laptop
2010-02-28T11:15:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	sabat	you meant wired
2010-02-28T11:16:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	sabat	ok, open up terminal and type in sudo aptitude install fw-cutter
2010-02-28T11:19:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	sabat	but you're now downloading it right?
2010-02-28T11:20:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	sabat	that's ok, umm, check inside /lib/firmware to see if there's a directory named b43 and inside that directory named b43 if there are files starting with b0g0
2010-02-28T11:23:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	sabat	try navigating into hardware drivers and give it a shot
2010-02-28T14:09:00.000Z	sabat	psycho_oreos	& joshua: little late on my reply, but just so you know it all works
