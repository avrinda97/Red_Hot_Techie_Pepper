2006-06-14T09:14:00.000Z	leafw		has anyone installed xgl on powerpc laptops ?
2006-06-14T09:14:00.000Z	spikeb	leafw	i can't find any binary packages, so i havent
2006-06-14T09:15:00.000Z	leafw	spikeb	: by binary packages you mean from apt-get, or for the graphics card ?
2006-06-14T09:15:00.000Z	spikeb	leafw	i mean for the xgl packages
2006-06-14T09:15:00.000Z	spikeb	leafw	all the packages i found were i386 only
2006-06-14T09:16:00.000Z	leafw	spikeb	: there is a xserver-xgl package at the moment on the universe repos
2006-06-14T09:16:00.000Z	spikeb		woah
2006-06-14T09:16:00.000Z	leafw	spikeb	: I was wondering if anyone has installed it, I assume someone has !
2006-06-14T09:16:00.000Z	spikeb	leafw	you're right!
2006-06-14T09:16:00.000Z	leafw	spikeb	: I ponder too xDDD
2006-06-14T09:17:00.000Z	leafw	spikeb	: and xgl or aixgl ? what may be better for ppc ?
2006-06-14T09:17:00.000Z	spikeb	leafw	i have no experience with either
2006-06-14T09:17:00.000Z	leafw	spikeb	: aiglx supports several ATI cards, which powerbooks have
2006-06-14T09:18:00.000Z	spikeb	leafw	then it might be worth checking out
2006-06-14T09:18:00.000Z	leafw	spikeb	: indeed
2006-06-14T09:18:00.000Z	leafw	spikeb	: do you remember the command to print the graphics card? pci-something ?
2006-06-14T09:18:00.000Z	spikeb	leafw	lspci
2006-06-14T09:18:00.000Z	leafw		Subhuman : thanks!
