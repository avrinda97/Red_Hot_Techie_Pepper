2007-02-17T09:08:00.000Z	Seracht		Quick question guys. I have a 320 and a 80gb hdd. Windows is on the 320 and I want to install ubuntu on the 80gb. How should I partition it?
2007-02-17T09:08:00.000Z	Seracht		I am thinking 15 EMT3, 1 Swap Area, rest FAT32
2007-02-17T09:09:00.000Z	Seracht		1 gb for awap
2007-02-17T09:09:00.000Z	Seracht		er swap
2007-02-17T09:10:00.000Z	larson9999	Seracht	why the fat32?
2007-02-17T09:14:00.000Z	larson9999	Seracht	if you pick ext3 over ext2 do yourself a favor and print out or bookmark the forum posts about how to recover when windows borks the ext3.
2007-02-17T09:15:00.000Z	Seracht	larson9999	heh ok
2007-02-17T09:15:00.000Z	larson9999	Seracht	i would for that partition you plan to share with windows
2007-02-17T09:24:00.000Z	larson9999	Seracht	my normal recommendation for dual booting is to make the windwos drive the slave and the linux drive the primary.  it's not the only way to do it but i found by experience that it leads to fewer problems
2007-02-17T09:25:00.000Z	Seracht	larson9999	I tried that last time
2007-02-17T09:27:00.000Z	larson9999	Seracht	if you did that, the windows boot loader would have been totally intact and there shouldn't have been any issues.
2007-02-17T09:27:00.000Z	Seracht	larson9999	I think it is because I formatted the primary hdd (the 80)
2007-02-17T09:27:00.000Z	larson9999	Seracht	that wouldn't matter.  you could then just tell your bios to boot from the 2nd drive.
2007-02-17T09:28:00.000Z	Seracht	larson9999	hmmm.....I dunno man I tried that
2007-02-17T09:29:00.000Z	larson9999	Seracht	but when you install linux it will see the windows drive and set up grub to boot it without messing with the windows boot loader.
2007-02-17T09:29:00.000Z	larson9999	Seracht	when you got that message which drive was windows on?  first or second?
2007-02-17T09:29:00.000Z	Seracht	larson9999	thats a pic i got from the weh
2007-02-17T09:32:00.000Z	larson9999	Seracht	yep and vice versa.  and most other linux apps.  'gnome' and 'kde' 'apps' is a bit of a misnomer.  you can use apps for one in another
