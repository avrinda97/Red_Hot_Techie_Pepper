2008-11-27T03:17:00.000Z	melol2		I have  window placement problem that has been going on for the past year or so. And it is progressing to be more and more annoying. can anyone help? It is putting a window continually in the very bottom right hand corner so I have to switch desktops to move it into view. Not every program, just that specific one. pics: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=6257737
2008-11-27T03:17:00.000Z	melol2		this is very annoying because I am in a java class and it constantly is slowing me down
2008-11-27T03:18:00.000Z	Slart	melol2	that's the way the "big desktop" works
2008-11-27T03:18:00.000Z	Slart	melol2	at least in compiz..
2008-11-27T03:19:00.000Z	melol2	Slart	i use compiz. How do i fix this?
2008-11-27T03:19:00.000Z	Slart	melol2	the way compiz handles different desktops is to create one big desktop and let you watch separate parts of it
2008-11-27T03:19:00.000Z	melol2	Slart	all my programs start mid-screen. but that one starts bottom right corner
2008-11-27T03:20:00.000Z	melol2	Slart	then it starts at the very bottom so only the top bar is showing
2008-11-27T03:20:00.000Z	Slart	melol2	ah.. sorry.. you don't want that window down there?
2008-11-27T03:21:00.000Z	Slart	melol2	I misunderstood... hang on.. I think there's a setting for it
2008-11-27T03:21:00.000Z	melol2	Slart	no i want it to cascade/appear in the center
2008-11-27T03:22:00.000Z	Slart	melol2	have you tried the "Place Windows" settings in ccsm?
2008-11-27T03:23:00.000Z	Slart	melol2	I think you can set some kind of default behaviour and even force certain winodows to act in special ways
2008-11-27T03:23:00.000Z	melol2	Slart	yeah i've tried. but it seems to have no effect
2008-11-27T03:24:00.000Z	Slart	melol2	perhaps the application creating the window is doing something wrong?
2008-11-27T03:26:00.000Z	melol2	Slart	is it possible that BlueJ bypasses compiz placement?
2008-11-27T03:26:00.000Z	Slart	melol2	if that's the only program doing this then it might be a possibility
2008-11-27T03:27:00.000Z	melol2	Slart	is there any way to fix this that you know of? and is there anything I have to enable by default for "Place Window" to work?
2008-11-27T03:28:00.000Z	Slart	melol2	hmm.. I don't know of any existing fixes.. actually I've never had this problem so I haven't looked into it
