2006-09-25T14:24:00.000Z	jUggERNAUt1980		i tried setting my box up so i could share my connection with my friend who brought his win2000 system over, and followed the instructions on a howto page, but it didn't work.  i did something wrong, but don't know what it is.  can someone help me out with a solution?
2006-09-25T14:25:00.000Z	ringerc	jUggERNAUt1980	Which page would be useful to know...
2006-09-25T14:25:00.000Z	ringerc	jUggERNAUt1980	and were you trying to use his win2k system as the gateway, or your Ubuntu box?

2006-09-25T14:26:00.000Z	jUggERNAUt1980	ringerc	i was trying to use my box as the gateway.
2006-09-25T14:33:00.000Z	ringerc	jUggERNAUt1980	... and were you trying to share your connection with your friend using a wired network card between the two machines, routing through a wifi card in your machine to the neighbour's (!!bad!!) wifi? What's your network layout?
2006-09-25T14:35:00.000Z	ringerc	jUggERNAUt1980	Also, I'd be very surprised if Ubuntu doesn't have a GUI option to enable routing in their GUI network config tool. Maybe someone who uses Ubuntu's GUI sysadmin stuff will know?
2006-09-25T14:39:00.000Z	jUggERNAUt1980	ringerc	my network layout?  i'm not sure what you mean by that.
2006-09-25T14:39:00.000Z	ringerc	jUggERNAUt1980	What's plugged into what
2006-09-25T14:39:00.000Z	jUggERNAUt1980	ringerc	i unplugged his system from mine, and i don't really know the specs of the router
2006-09-25T14:40:00.000Z	jUggERNAUt1980	ringerc	i had his sys connected to my lappy box with a crosover cable.
2006-09-25T14:41:00.000Z	jUggERNAUt1980	ringerc	my lappy is connected to a wifi network.
2006-09-25T14:42:00.000Z	ringerc	jUggERNAUt1980	ok - so a pretty simple NAT setup. No reason it shouldn't work. What interfaces did you specify when runing the masquerade command in that doc/
2006-09-25T14:43:00.000Z	jUggERNAUt1980	ringerc	i specified the wifi interface
2006-09-25T14:44:00.000Z	ringerc	jUggERNAUt1980	Honestly, I fail to see why they suggest using dnsmasq and ipmasq.... there's nothing wrong with a simple IP forward rule. Try getting rid of those two packages then:
2006-09-25T14:48:00.000Z	ringerc	jUggERNAUt1980	iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o ${wifi-interface} -j MASQUERADE
2006-09-25T14:49:00.000Z	ringerc	jUggERNAUt1980	iptables -I FORWARD 1 -o ${wifi-interface} -j ACCEPT
2006-09-25T14:49:00.000Z	ringerc	jUggERNAUt1980	iptables -I FORWARD 1 -i ${wifi-interface} -j ACCEPT
2006-09-25T14:53:00.000Z	jUggERNAUt1980	ringerc	should i use apt-get remove or apt-get --purge remove?
