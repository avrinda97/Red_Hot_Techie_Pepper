2008-03-28T10:23:00.000Z	RabidWeezle		I've tried xvncviewer, vncviewer, and xvnc4viewer and none of them are logging in to any vnc servers, I do like, vncviewer 192.168.0.99:0 and it acts like it's logging in, and no screen ever pops up asking for a password. but in windows using realvnc I login just fine
2008-03-28T10:24:00.000Z	davenull	RabidWeezle	leave off the :0
2008-03-28T10:25:00.000Z	davenull	RabidWeezle	: tells it to connect to port 0 and vnc is 5700 i think
2008-03-28T10:27:00.000Z	davenull	RabidWeezle	what is the full command you enter?
2008-03-28T10:28:00.000Z	davenull	RabidWeezle	have you made sure all the settings on the server are correct?
2008-03-28T10:31:00.000Z	davenull	RabidWeezle	im almost 100% no zero
2008-03-28T10:32:00.000Z	davenull	RabidWeezle	the vnc server might not be configured correctly
2008-03-28T10:33:00.000Z	davenull	RabidWeezle	then that is the little bit of info we needed , huh?
2008-03-28T10:33:00.000Z	RabidWeezle	davenull	this machine is the one with the messed up viewer, hence why I'm asking about it
2008-03-28T10:34:00.000Z	davenull	RabidWeezle	didnt know if you had others, the viewer doesnt really have any config to mess up, thats why I thought it was the server.
2008-03-28T10:35:00.000Z	davenull	RabidWeezle	 next question, how is the box connected to the net?
2008-03-28T10:36:00.000Z	davenull	RabidWeezle	and the xbox?
2008-03-28T10:40:00.000Z	davenull	RabidWeezle	fun, well there isnt any conf file for the viewer
2008-03-28T10:42:00.000Z	davenull	RabidWeezle	all i can say is pop in the live cd and try it on that, if it works, its your viewer install, if not, network issues
2008-03-28T10:42:00.000Z	davenull	RabidWeezle	could be a firewall issue  though, you have firestarter?
2008-03-28T10:43:00.000Z	davenull	RabidWeezle	then the live cd is the test
2008-03-28T10:45:00.000Z	davenull	RabidWeezle	with firstarter running, connect the viewer and look for the icon to turn red
2008-03-28T10:45:00.000Z	davenull	RabidWeezle	if it turns red, it is blocking the request
2008-03-28T10:47:00.000Z	davenull	RabidWeezle	well then, live cd it is
