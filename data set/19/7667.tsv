2011-08-08T01:46:00.000Z	wols	coraxx	you need a virtualbox version which allows rdp access. IIRC this means you need to get it from virtualbox.org and can't use the GPLed version
2011-08-08T01:48:00.000Z	coraxx	wols	thanx for replying :-) ... yes I'm using the non-free version from VirtualBox.org's website ...and I'm having trouble with the RDP-part ...it doesn't seem to work.  Besides I'm running VirtualBox on a server, so I will have multiple vm's running ...and even tho I can't set up multiple port (besides the standard 3389), it doesn't matter as most system wont like it.
2011-08-08T01:50:00.000Z	wols	coraxx	the other choice is to install a sshd in the client VM and connect through that
2011-08-08T01:52:00.000Z	coraxx	wols	that part I have already set up ...so the internal workings of the vm is accesible :-) ...however I would still like to have console access.  I have tried to do the 'ssh -X -C user@xx.xx.xx.xx VirtualBox' which starts the VirtualBox client on a remote PC ...and it shows which machines a running, which is good...just can't access the console :-(
2011-08-08T02:05:00.000Z	coraxx	wols	have you ever seen the VRDP server feature work in VirtualBox yourself ?
2011-08-08T02:18:00.000Z	coraxx	wols	have you ever seen the VRDP server feature work in VirtualBox, yourself ?
2011-08-08T02:22:00.000Z	coraxx	wols	damn :-) what's your secret buddy ?
2011-08-08T02:23:00.000Z	coraxx	wols	I have 'clicked it. ...I have 'typed it' ...and it got me nowhere :-(
2011-08-08T02:24:00.000Z	wols	coraxx	just enabled it in the vbox control panel and started the VM. then connected to the specified rdp port on the host computer
2011-08-08T02:24:00.000Z	coraxx	wols	on the 'remote computer' I assumed you meant ;-)
2011-08-08T02:24:00.000Z	wols	coraxx	no, the host computer I mean
2011-08-08T02:25:00.000Z	wols	coraxx	the host on which vbox runs and which executes the client VM
2011-08-08T02:25:00.000Z	coraxx	wols	the host computer doesn't have XServer or any graphics libraries installed...its a server...an Ubuntu server....can't run Terminal Client on that
2011-08-08T02:25:00.000Z	wols	coraxx	it doesn't matter. it has a network connection
2011-08-08T02:26:00.000Z	wols	coraxx	you don't run the rdp client there, you point your rdp client to it.
2011-08-08T02:26:00.000Z	coraxx	wols	sorry I misread...you wrote 'on to the host' ...I read it as 'on the host connect to it'
2011-08-08T02:27:00.000Z	coraxx	wols	I know ... (don't worry, I'm an IT guy ..trust the server/client relationship is a prerequitsite for this job ;-)
2011-08-08T02:27:00.000Z	coraxx	wols	*trust me
