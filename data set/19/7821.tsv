2008-07-20T16:40:00.000Z	olskolirc		sigma add it to your /etc/host file
2008-07-20T16:42:00.000Z	sigma	olskolirc	do i need to restart something after doing that?
2008-07-20T16:42:00.000Z	olskolirc		10.144.65.79 sigma.com or whatever you are calling your .com
2008-07-20T16:42:00.000Z	olskolirc		no
2008-07-20T16:43:00.000Z	olskolirc	sigma	you have to set up your vhost
2008-07-20T16:43:00.000Z	sigma	olskolirc	how do i test it?
2008-07-20T16:43:00.000Z	olskolirc		i have a link hold on
2008-07-20T16:43:00.000Z	olskolirc		test it by typing your apache address in your browser
2008-07-20T16:43:00.000Z	sigma	olskolirc	you should see a index page
2008-07-20T16:44:00.000Z	olskolirc		hold on
2008-07-20T16:44:00.000Z	olskolirc		right
2008-07-20T16:44:00.000Z	sigma	olskolirc	do you see anything?
2008-07-20T16:45:00.000Z	olskolirc		no sigma its all local until you register that domain
2008-07-20T16:45:00.000Z	sigma	olskolirc	so you can't access it off the ip address solely? strange because thats what i used to do in windows
2008-07-20T16:46:00.000Z	olskolirc	sigma	try this: http://www.daryl.mu/2008/01/20/howto-set-up-apache-virtual-hosts-on-ubuntu-gutsy-gibbon/ the only thing about these instructions, is that it doesn't tell you to add your domain to /etc/hosts
2008-07-20T16:46:00.000Z	olskolirc		with apache sigma ?
2008-07-20T16:47:00.000Z	sigma	olskolirc	yeah
2008-07-20T16:48:00.000Z	olskolirc		it should work the same after you point your localhost to your .com
2008-07-20T16:49:00.000Z	sigma	olskolirc	ok turns out my external ip is different but when i use http://196.38.218.25:80 to try access the site, it connects but times out
