2006-07-28T11:59:00.000Z	ernz		Hello, is anyone here able to offer me some guidance on general Ruby development questions I have?
2006-07-28T11:59:00.000Z	gregg__	ernz	#ruby
2006-07-28T11:59:00.000Z	ernz	gregg__	Good call.
2006-07-28T12:00:00.000Z	gregg__	ernz	I prefer python, though
2006-07-28T12:01:00.000Z	gregg__	ernz	depends on what you are trying to achieve
2006-07-28T12:01:00.000Z	gregg__	ernz	python :p
2006-07-28T12:01:00.000Z	gregg__	ernz	python has nice win32 extensions and a very good windows port
2006-07-28T12:03:00.000Z	gregg__	ernz	wysiwyg for programming?
2006-07-28T12:04:00.000Z	ernz	gregg__	You can knock WYSIWYG IDE's all you wan't the fact is that they build apps quicker.
2006-07-28T12:05:00.000Z	gregg__	ernz	never seen a wysiwyg ide :)
2006-07-28T12:05:00.000Z	gregg__	ernz	yes, but programming by point'n'click? that's news for me :)
2006-07-28T12:07:00.000Z	gregg__	ernz	not that I don't like building GUIs in a graphical way, but the programming itself still has to be done by hand, doesn't it?
2006-07-28T12:08:00.000Z	ernz	gregg__	True, it's nice to have a basic, set template to work with though.
2006-07-28T12:08:00.000Z	gregg__	ernz	python IMHO has more and better 3rd party libraries and bindings
2006-07-28T12:09:00.000Z	gregg__	ernz	you can have that, too. I built GTK2 apps using glade, a GUI designer and then used tepache to create skeleton python code from the XML description of teh GUI
2006-07-28T12:10:00.000Z	ernz	gregg__	You make me feel like a n00b.
2006-07-28T12:11:00.000Z	gregg__	ernz	it's not that hard... wait a sec
2006-07-28T12:11:00.000Z	ernz	gregg__	sure
