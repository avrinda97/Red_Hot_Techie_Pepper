2006-05-15T16:48:00.000Z	LittleFae		Hello there people.
2006-05-15T16:49:00.000Z	LittleFae		I am in need of a little, hopefully minor, assistance with Ubuntu Hoary Hedgehog, and the nautilus file browser.  Namely, I don't want it to run every single time, I click on 'browse to' in an application, whilst I'm running under xfce.
2006-05-15T16:51:00.000Z	LittleFae		Is there a simple way to ensure that, at the very least, this nautilus crap doesn't take over the desktop, then?
2006-05-15T16:52:00.000Z	LittleFae		Well, I installed xfce, and, well, nautilus keeps screwing things up, whenever I try to work with xfce. :(
2006-05-15T16:53:00.000Z	LittleFae		:/
2006-05-15T16:53:00.000Z	LittleFae		No, xffm is on there, as is rox.
2006-05-15T16:54:00.000Z	cafuego_	LittleFae	Is it set to be used as default?

2006-05-15T05:48:00.000Z	cafuego_	LittleFae	The thing with advice from people about their own product.. ;-)
2006-05-15T05:49:00.000Z	cafuego_	LittleFae	That said, if you've already got installed, go with it.
2006-05-15T05:51:00.000Z	cafuego_	LittleFae	diffeernt internal arch, no?
