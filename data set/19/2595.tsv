2010-02-25T06:09:00.000Z	seanbrystone		is there like a disk utility to fix bad sectors, or time for a new hdd (already!?)
2010-02-25T06:10:00.000Z	Typos_King	seanbrystone	boot with the live-cd and run ->  sudo e2fsck -c /dev/sda
2010-02-25T06:10:00.000Z	Typos_King	seanbrystone	   /dev/sda meaning the device....wahtever it's for you...hda.. else :)
2010-02-25T06:10:00.000Z	seanbrystone	Typos_King	ok ty
2010-02-25T06:13:00.000Z	seanbrystone	Typos_King	i run sudo e2fsck -c /dev/sda with the drive unmounted right?
2010-02-25T06:14:00.000Z	Typos_King	seanbrystone	 yes    sudo e2fsck -c   DEVICEHERE;   does a disk check and then runs badblocks, which checks for clusters and sectors physical state inthe drive
2010-02-25T06:15:00.000Z	seanbrystone	Typos_King	will that fix the bad sectors or just move them to a closed off are of the hdd kinda like spinrite does?
2010-02-25T06:16:00.000Z	Typos_King	seanbrystone	  there's no fixing for bad sectors/clusters, just 'marking' so the OS doesn't use them, but most if not all HDs these days use S.M.A.R.T which does  that automatically when one goes bad
2010-02-25T06:18:00.000Z	seanbrystone	Typos_King	oh ok, im not sure if this drive has SMART or not, it's a usb external 300 Gig hdd thats about 2 years old with very little use, so i was shocked to see it had bad ssectors already :((((
2010-02-25T06:48:00.000Z	Typos_King	seanbrystone	  bad sectors are not OS dependant, are just media physical issues, independent of the filesystem
2010-02-25T06:52:00.000Z	Typos_King	seanbrystone	   that means something is up withh the HD
2010-02-25T06:53:00.000Z	Typos_King	seanbrystone	  just recently had a hd going south on me..... lots of errors on e2fsck, ran smart monitor tools, reported the HD was rather bad and possibly developing more bad sectors,had to get a new one
2010-03-02T04:13:00.000Z	Typos_King	seanbrystone	  usually -> eject /media/dvd   or eject /dev/dvd
2010-03-10T07:01:00.000Z	seanbrystone	Typos_King	how is that off topic?
2010-03-10T07:01:00.000Z	Typos_King	seanbrystone	 a birdie here on my lap is telling me you already know the answer to that sentence
2010-03-10T07:02:00.000Z	seanbrystone	Typos_King	donno what you've been puffing on man, I simply asking why is Ubuntu One'
2010-03-16T03:23:00.000Z	Typos_King	seanbrystone	  haven't we been at this aisle before?
2010-03-16T03:24:00.000Z	seanbrystone	Typos_King	you always raggin on me, knock it off.
2010-03-16T03:25:00.000Z	Typos_King	seanbrystone	     apt-get install --ignore-missing
