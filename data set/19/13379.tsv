2011-09-21T02:47:00.000Z	bilygates		question: will i be able to easily use/install gnome2/3 in oneiric (e.g. from PPAs), without unity?

2011-09-21T02:49:00.000Z	bilygates		probably also php
2011-09-21T02:49:00.000Z	bilygates		yay for gnome3 :)
2011-09-21T02:49:00.000Z	bilygates		but why would gnome2 be a bad idea?
