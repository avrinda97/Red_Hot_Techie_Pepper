2006-05-18T09:43:00.000Z	bbrazil	Arrick	with modern drives, I doubt you want a low level format. What are you trying to do?
2006-05-18T09:44:00.000Z	Arrick	bbrazil	its ancient, and I am trying to put it back to use n a 98 system
2006-05-18T09:45:00.000Z	bbrazil	Arrick	dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/hda bs=1024 count=1 <-- run this and then pop in the 98 CD (warning: this command is dangerous)
2006-05-18T09:45:00.000Z	bbrazil	Arrick	ssuming you want only 98
2006-05-18T09:46:00.000Z	bbrazil	Arrick	if there's no partition table, 98se will ask to create one
2006-05-18T09:47:00.000Z	bbrazil	Arrick	exact error?
2006-05-18T09:47:00.000Z	bbrazil	Arrick	you typed 'dd' as teh command?
2006-05-18T09:48:00.000Z	bbrazil	Arrick	dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/hda bs=1024 count=1           (Warning: dangerous command)
2006-05-18T09:49:00.000Z	bbrazil	Arrick	oh, you're on windows?
2006-05-18T09:51:00.000Z	bbrazil	Arrick	what are you currently running on this system?
2006-05-18T09:51:00.000Z	bbrazil	Arrick	so how are you interacting with the system?
2006-05-18T09:52:00.000Z	bbrazil	Arrick	ah, you should have mentioned you were in DOS
2006-05-18T09:53:00.000Z	bbrazil	Arrick	run 'fdisk /mbr'
2006-05-18T09:55:00.000Z	bbrazil	Arrick	fdisk, and setup your partitions. Make sure the first one is bootable. If it's older than a P2 the first partition should be less that 1GB
2006-05-18T09:57:00.000Z	bbrazil	Arrick	then run 'setup'
2006-05-18T09:57:00.000Z	bbrazil	Arrick	dunno how it work with flopies, I've only done it with a CD
2006-05-18T09:58:00.000Z	bbrazil	Arrick	you sure it's a 500Mhz?
2006-05-18T10:00:00.000Z	Arrick	bbrazil	its checking fat now
2006-05-18T10:03:00.000Z	Arrick	bbrazil	ok bad disk, time for another then
