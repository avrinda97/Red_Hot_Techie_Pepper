2006-08-09T16:50:00.000Z	Tonren		Ugh.. does anyone know where I can find a copy of the GIMPShop .deb file?
2006-08-09T16:52:00.000Z	Tonren		Gah, screw it... maybe I should just start learning GIMP.
2006-08-09T16:52:00.000Z	Tonren		Six years of experience down the drain... do I really love Linux that much?  Hmm.
2006-08-09T16:52:00.000Z	Tonren		Maybe I should setup VMWare.. but is it worth it just for Photoshop?
2006-08-09T16:54:00.000Z	recon0	Tonren	I'll package it for you.
2006-08-09T16:54:00.000Z	Tonren	recon0	Thanks!
2006-08-09T16:56:00.000Z	Tonren	recon0	You know, it's OK, I think I'm just going to dual boot, dude.  Don't go to the trouble.
2006-08-09T16:56:00.000Z	recon0	Tonren	I'm practicing. I need it.
2006-08-09T05:03:00.000Z	recon0	Tonren	I found the debian package. Want the link?
2006-08-09T05:04:00.000Z	Tonren	recon0	Sure.
2006-08-09T05:04:00.000Z	recon0	Tonren	OK. http://web.njit.edu/~st7/mirror/GIMPShop/gimpshop-2.2.11.deb
2006-08-09T05:04:00.000Z	Tonren	recon0	After all this hollering and bellyaching, though, I think I may just end up compiling it from source.
2006-08-09T05:05:00.000Z	Tonren	recon0	Warbo made a good point, which is that GIMPShop is not "part of Ubuntu", which means I really can't expect the repositories to solve my problems for me like usual.
2006-08-09T05:05:00.000Z	recon0	Tonren	meh.
2006-08-09T05:05:00.000Z	Tonren	recon0	I appreciate your time, though.  Sorry to send you on whatever wild goose chase you just embarked.  :\
2006-08-09T05:06:00.000Z	recon0	Tonren	actually, it was prominently displayed on the gimpshop front page.
2006-08-09T05:06:00.000Z	Tonren	recon0	I must have missed it.
2006-08-09T05:06:00.000Z	recon0	Tonren	I'm gonna compile from source, too.
2006-08-09T05:08:00.000Z	Tonren	recon0	i lol'd
