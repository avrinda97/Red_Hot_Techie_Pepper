2010-01-23T19:05:00.000Z	Psyonara		Hi everyone. My Ubuntu installation started doing a weird thing today. When I load some web pages, external files (e.g. CSS, JS, etc) will not load. From what I can see, it's only when those files are from a subdomain. Any ideas? It does this in all browsers, but when I try on Windows, it works fine.
2010-01-23T19:05:00.000Z	hyperstream	Psyonara	that is very strange.
2010-01-23T19:11:00.000Z	Psyonara	hyperstream	thanks, might just try that...
2010-01-23T19:07:00.000Z	hyperstream	Psyonara	something is blocking them, some software id assume
2010-01-23T19:07:00.000Z	Psyonara	hyperstream	not sure what it could be, I didn't install anything recently.
2010-01-23T19:10:00.000Z	Psyonara	hyperstream	thanks anyway, will keep on trying.
2010-01-23T19:10:00.000Z	hyperstream	Psyonara	i couldnt imagen such an issue thats all, sorry mate
2010-01-23T19:11:00.000Z	Psyonara	hyperstream	no worries, thanks. :)
2010-01-23T19:11:00.000Z	hyperstream	Psyonara	to be honest id be doing a fresh install and get on these sites straight away and install stuff one by one till my setup is complete
2010-01-23T19:13:00.000Z	hyperstream	Psyonara	I had extreme laptop issues with 9.10 only thing that solved it was #ubuntu+1 (Developement next release 10.4 lucid) if you should find yourself banging you head agaisnt the wall
2010-01-23T19:13:00.000Z	hyperstream	Psyonara	havnt had any issues with it so far
2010-01-23T19:14:00.000Z	Psyonara	hyperstream	ok thanks. I'm still on 9.04, cuz I had problems with 9.10. Might have to try 10.04 then. Is yours relatively stable?
2010-01-23T19:14:00.000Z	hyperstream	Psyonara	havnt had an issue yet mate, and ive slammed it from pentesting to everyday home/office usuage.
2010-01-23T19:15:00.000Z	Psyonara	hyperstream	Ok, will consider it. I just find it strange that this problem comes up from one day to the next, without any major changes to the system.
2010-01-23T19:16:00.000Z	hyperstream	Psyonara	what ikonia said is true, but many people ive solved laptop issues with have agreed, i would suggest not upgrading like ikonia is suggesting but a clean install if you did need to attempt that. install 9.10 and debug first tho :)
2010-01-23T19:17:00.000Z	Psyonara	hyperstream	yeah, I was thinking of trying 9.10, but haven't decided yet.
2010-01-23T19:19:00.000Z	hyperstream	Psyonara	i always prefer clean installs, but i cannot say a upgrade wouldnt help
2010-01-23T19:20:00.000Z	Psyonara	hyperstream	thanks.
2010-01-23T19:20:00.000Z	hyperstream	Psyonara	not a problem
