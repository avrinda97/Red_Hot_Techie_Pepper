2009-01-06T05:30:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	corey_	can you kill nm-applet?
2009-01-06T05:31:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	corey_	or, you could install wicd (which takes the place of nm-applet) then you can just manually disconnect and connect from your network.
2009-01-06T05:42:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	corey_	did you install wicd?
