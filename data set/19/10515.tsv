2006-06-08T16:50:00.000Z	gavagai		i have a savage ix s3 video card and i am using the savage driver.  all i can get is 640x480.  any ideas?
2006-06-08T05:04:00.000Z	gavagai		how do i start and stop services in ubuntu from the terminal?  like in mandrake 'service foo start/stop/restart'.  i just installed snort and it started snort, but i don't want it running
2006-06-08T05:04:00.000Z	Warbo	gavagai	"sudo /etc/init.d/nameofthing start/stop/restart"
2006-06-08T05:04:00.000Z	gavagai	Warbo	thanks
2006-06-08T05:55:00.000Z	Warbo	gavagai	"lspci" will tell you what exactly it is so you can Google for what the driver is called, then just "modprobe therightdriver"
2006-06-08T05:55:00.000Z	gavagai	Warbo	thanks
2006-06-08T05:56:00.000Z	gavagai	Warbo	it has the right driver, lspci and the 'system manager' thing have the same soundcard listed
2006-06-08T05:57:00.000Z	Warbo	gavagai	You need to do "sudo modprobe drivername" then try doing something like "cat /dev/urandom > /dev/dsp" (use ctrl-c to stop it)
2006-06-08T05:58:00.000Z	gavagai	Warbo	ok, i'll try that.  thanks.  how do i know the driver name?
2006-06-08T05:58:00.000Z	Warbo	gavagai	I said before, Google it
2006-06-08T06:37:00.000Z	Warbo	gavagai	If you add a module to /etc/modules then it will be loaded at boot and (hopefully) any starting services will use it
2006-06-10T08:21:00.000Z	Warbo	gavagai	HAS!
2006-06-10T08:21:00.000Z	Warbo	gavagai	Well I don't use UAE much, since I have an Amiga right next to me
2006-06-21T15:59:00.000Z	Warbo	gavagai	That sounds sooooooo wrong :)
2006-06-21T16:00:00.000Z	gavagai	Warbo	fingering?  :)
2006-06-22T16:00:00.000Z	Warbo	gavagai	You finger users to sort of check each other out
2006-07-08T15:39:00.000Z	Warbo	gavagai	Source isn't needed, only the headers
2006-07-08T15:39:00.000Z	Warbo	gavagai	Also the kernel stuff has been renamed to "linux-image" "linux-headers" and "linux-source". Only the 2.4 branch has "kernel-xxxxxx"
2006-07-08T15:43:00.000Z	gavagai	Warbo	i see, thanks
