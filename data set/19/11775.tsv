2006-08-04T14:43:00.000Z	scott		can anyone help me with a media/firefox related question. when for example palying music via flash in a window in firefox, if i then browse in a new tab to a different website or refresh the current page then my music/video stutters in the other tab (in flash etc) while the current page loads. is there an way to avoid it from stuttering?
2006-08-04T14:44:00.000Z	sethk	scott	possibly you coudl set up quotas for how much bandwidth a single connection can use, but I think on average it would be more annoying then helpful.
2006-08-04T14:44:00.000Z	sethk	scott	you would be slowing down every access, to fix the case where something is streaming.
2006-08-04T14:44:00.000Z	sethk	scott	unlikely
2006-08-04T14:44:00.000Z	sethk	scott	why would you assume that?
2006-08-04T14:45:00.000Z	sethk	scott	doesn't compute.  If a new connection is downloading at maximum speed, it is going to crowd out other packets.
2006-08-04T14:46:00.000Z	sethk	scott	try increasing your streaming buffers.  if it behaves exactly the same way, then you may be right, but I'd be surprised.
2006-08-04T14:46:00.000Z	scott	sethk	i KNOW bandwidth isnt a problem as ive done this in windows with the exact same files etc, so i can 100% garuntee bandwidth isnt the issue
2006-08-04T14:46:00.000Z	sethk	scott	no, that again is not correct reasoning
2006-08-04T14:46:00.000Z	sethk	scott	all that proves is that windows may be slower in bringing up the web page.
2006-08-04T14:47:00.000Z	sethk	scott	in fact, your argument proves that it is not a CPU issue, at least just as much as it proves anything about bandwidth
2006-08-04T14:48:00.000Z	sethk	scott	not at all.  why wouldn't firefox, or whichever browser, running in windows not do exactly the same thing?
2006-08-04T14:48:00.000Z	sethk	scott	why do you assume it is rendering, and not downloading?
2006-08-04T14:50:00.000Z	sethk	scott	you may be right, but unless you know that it would download more quickly if the music were not streaming, you haven't really proved much.
2006-08-04T14:51:00.000Z	sethk	scott	many distro download sites provide data rather slowly
2006-08-04T14:51:00.000Z	scott	sethk	i dotn think you properly understand what im saying, after the first run of a song im listening too, it is cached...i can play it even if i disconnect from net, yet it still stutters when browsing another page on another tab/window
2006-08-04T14:52:00.000Z	sethk	scott	well, you didn't say anything about caching.  Unless you are playing it from a local source I doubt the entire thing is cached.
2006-08-04T14:52:00.000Z	sethk	scott	try a different browser, see if the results change.
2006-08-04T14:53:00.000Z	sethk	scott	not me.
