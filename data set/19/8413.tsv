2007-03-31T07:10:00.000Z	baktaah		 Anyone know how I can get to my NTSF drives with both write and read permission?
2007-03-31T07:11:00.000Z	NorthernLights	baktaah	support for ntfs was so buggy that it was removed i think. last time i checked it was experimental kernel feature which killed my partitions
2007-03-31T07:14:00.000Z	NorthernLights	baktaah	use windowmaker :)
2007-03-31T07:15:00.000Z	NorthernLights	baktaah	maybe some gdesklets or gkreIIm would help you
2007-03-31T07:15:00.000Z	baktaah	NorthernLights	windowmaker hey?
2007-03-31T07:15:00.000Z	baktaah	NorthernLights	gdesklets was useless, grekiim is just a cpu minotor
2007-03-31T07:15:00.000Z	NorthernLights	baktaah	just trolling a little bit : windowmaker is my favorite window manager. it has really nice dockapps
2007-03-31T07:16:00.000Z	baktaah	NorthernLights	gonna download and check it then =) thanks
2007-03-31T07:21:00.000Z	baktaah	NorthernLights	what cool dockapps does windowmanager have
2007-03-31T07:21:00.000Z	NorthernLights	baktaah	what do you want to monitor ?
2007-03-31T07:21:00.000Z	baktaah	NorthernLights	network, memory, cpu.
2007-03-31T07:21:00.000Z	NorthernLights	baktaah	for memory and cpu i use wmfire (fire growing accordingly to the load). for network i use wmifinfo
2007-03-31T07:29:00.000Z	baktaah	NorthernLights	man, Wmfire crasches
2007-03-31T07:31:00.000Z	NorthernLights	baktaah	what does it say ?

2007-03-31T07:35:00.000Z	baktaah	NorthernLights	the thing to the far right looks nice
2007-03-31T07:36:00.000Z	baktaah	NorthernLights	all the dockapps, How do I get them, or do I download all seperatly?
2007-03-31T07:36:00.000Z	NorthernLights	baktaah	some are included with windowmaker. many are in ubuntu repositories (all start with "wm")
2007-03-31T07:37:00.000Z	NorthernLights	baktaah	some other i compiled after downloading from freshmeat, found on www.windowmaker.info
