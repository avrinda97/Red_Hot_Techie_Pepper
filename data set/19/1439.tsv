2012-03-03T23:27:00.000Z	gid0	tr33m4n	yes but it doesnt let me
2012-03-03T23:28:00.000Z	tr33m4n	gid0	you need to install the native graphics driver for Ubuntu. The driver you are trying to install is designed for Windows, not Linux
2012-03-03T23:28:00.000Z	gid0	tr33m4n	any idea how to do?
2012-03-03T23:30:00.000Z	tr33m4n	gid0	open a new terminal session (open Gnome Terminal or equivalent) and run 'sudo jockey-gtk', or find Hardware Drivers in the Dash
2012-03-03T23:30:00.000Z	tr33m4n	gid0	Ubuntu should then let you know if you need any extra drivers for your system
