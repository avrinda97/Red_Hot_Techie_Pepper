2012-05-30T20:03:00.000Z	xentrepreneur		when i try to login, it opens a new session of same user
2012-05-30T20:04:00.000Z	iceroot	xentrepreneur	then the session was killed
2012-05-30T20:04:00.000Z	xentrepreneur		i can acces the session from the remote desktop
2012-05-30T20:04:00.000Z	iceroot	xentrepreneur	xrdp will always first look if there is another open session (not the session directly on the real screen because that session is different)
2012-05-30T20:05:00.000Z	iceroot	xentrepreneur	the real session on the machine directly is something different then an xrdp session
2012-05-30T20:05:00.000Z	xentrepreneur	iceroot	there's no workarpound to do that?
2012-05-30T20:06:00.000Z	iceroot	xentrepreneur	that is bot a bug, that is a feature
2012-05-30T20:06:00.000Z	iceroot	xentrepreneur	vnc is want to use the REAL session also from remote
2012-05-30T20:06:00.000Z	iceroot		is what you have to use
2012-05-30T20:07:00.000Z	xentrepreneur		but vnc is very slow for some reason,iceroot
2012-05-30T20:07:00.000Z	xentrepreneur		atleast for me
2012-05-30T20:07:00.000Z	iceroot	xentrepreneur	yes
2012-05-30T20:07:00.000Z	iceroot	xentrepreneur	but there is no other way
2012-05-30T20:07:00.000Z	iceroot	xentrepreneur	vnc is rendering the session on the server and you see the image, rdp is rendering the image on the client and is very fast
2012-05-30T20:07:00.000Z	iceroot	xentrepreneur	you cant use a normal session with rdp
2012-05-30T20:09:00.000Z	xentrepreneur	iceroot	if i rd from my computer to my own computer I should be able to access that session right? even then it opens a new session
2012-05-30T20:09:00.000Z	iceroot	xentrepreneur	?
