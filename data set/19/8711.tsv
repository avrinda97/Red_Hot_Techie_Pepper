2007-02-21T17:06:00.000Z	quark		I need some help installing the xfce flavor of ubuntu. I cant get it to install via the desktop CD
2007-02-21T17:07:00.000Z	quark		I have experence with debian so I know that all of my stuff is Linux compadible
2007-02-21T17:08:00.000Z	Sanne	quark	maybe the cd is bad, you can check it with a self test that's on the cd menu. Or you could try the alternate cd with a text based installer.
2007-02-21T17:09:00.000Z	quark	Sanne	I have done both, the CD is good and the text install has problems as well. I is somewhere in X but I cant figure out where.
2007-02-21T17:10:00.000Z	Sanne	quark	hmmm, are you sure your ram is ok? memtest is also on the cd.
2007-02-21T17:10:00.000Z	quark	Sanne	useally I have to swich from nv to vesa and install the nvidia propiraty drivers
2007-02-21T17:11:00.000Z	quark	Sanne	it should be works fine with windows ( Not dual booting physicaly swaping a HD)
2007-02-21T17:12:00.000Z	Sanne	quark	windows is more forgiving with bad ram, I would check it just to be sure let it run some hours best). On my husbands pc we could install windows, but nor kubuntu, weird errors, at the end it was one bad ram stick.
2007-02-21T17:13:00.000Z	quark	Sanne	it also works with my debian on a seprate HD so I know every thing works. Im migrateing to umbunt because faster repo updates
2007-02-21T17:13:00.000Z	Sanne	quark	hmmm... how far do you get with the install?
2007-02-21T17:14:00.000Z	quark	Sanne	it completes but on reboot to new system I end up with a black screen that cycles monitor between On with a weird line pattern and standby on 1.5 min cycle
2007-02-21T17:16:00.000Z	quark	Sanne	sorry if I wasnt as clear as I thought I was being it installs but something is wrong with display side of it.
2007-02-21T17:18:00.000Z	Sanne	quark	ok, then I have one further suggestion. Another error we had (after replacing the bad ram) was that X didn't start, but the usplash screen didn't give the focus to kdm. We solved it by removing "splash" from the boot kernel options in /boot/grub/menu.lst
2007-02-21T17:18:00.000Z	Sanne	quark	this doesn't sound exactly like your problem, though
2007-02-21T17:20:00.000Z	quark	Sanne	its got to be an odd thing. I have a debian box with fluxbox + rox and its all nice an neat. I did it with tutorials and messing around with it. Im only going to ubuntu because I want faster repo updates. maybe I should just learn to compile from source and scratch the whole *bunut thing. what do you think?
2007-02-21T17:21:00.000Z	Sanne	quark	I'd say don't give up yet ;) What about my suggestion about removing splash in the boot options?
2007-02-21T17:21:00.000Z	quark	Sanne	ill give it a shot and come back if it dosent work
2007-02-21T17:21:00.000Z	quark	Sanne	thanks
2007-02-21T17:22:00.000Z	Sanne	quark	good luck
