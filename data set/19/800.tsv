2011-09-01T03:03:00.000Z	bbbbbbbb		how do i find the mount point for my dvd drive
2011-09-01T03:03:00.000Z	zykotick9	bbbbbbbb	if it's currently mounted in a cli "mount"
2011-09-01T03:04:00.000Z	bbbbbbbb	zykotick9	what?
2011-09-01T03:04:00.000Z	zykotick9	bbbbbbbb	your cd/dvd mounted?
2011-09-01T03:05:00.000Z	bbbbbbbb	zykotick9	yeah it is mounted. and its at /dev/sr0. thanks
2011-09-01T03:06:00.000Z	zykotick9	bbbbbbbb	that's the device name, not the mount point
2011-09-01T03:07:00.000Z	bbbbbbbb	zykotick9	wheres the mount point then
2011-09-01T03:07:00.000Z	zykotick9	bbbbbbbb	/media/SOMTHING probably
2011-09-01T03:08:00.000Z	zykotick9	bbbbbbbb	that's working as designed!
2011-09-01T03:09:00.000Z	bbbbbbbb	zykotick9	but i need the mount point like  /media/cdrom to tell wine where to look for the drive
2011-09-01T03:09:00.000Z	zykotick9	bbbbbbbb	what is your REAL question/issue perhaps?
2011-09-01T03:10:00.000Z	zykotick9	bbbbbbbb	the "drive" is the device so /dev/sr0 - mount points only apply when something is in the drive
2011-09-01T03:14:00.000Z	zykotick9	bbbbbbbb	in the long run you'd be better served by finding replacements for your windows applications rather then relying on the cruch of wine
2011-09-01T03:16:00.000Z	bbbbbbbb	zykotick9	sure, but i have not yet found a program that rips dvds as fast and effective as dvdshrink
2011-09-01T03:17:00.000Z	zykotick9	bbbbbbbb	check out Handbrake (if you haven't already) & you want either MP4 or MPV output
2011-09-01T03:18:00.000Z	bbbbbbbb	zykotick9	i mostly don't care about the output since i usually just rip my originals once to watch them on the notebook and then delete them - but i will check it out, thx
2012-04-22T18:29:00.000Z	zykotick9	bbbbbbbb	can i ask, what video card are you using?
2012-04-22T18:30:00.000Z	bbbbbbbb	zykotick9	it is a built in intel HD video card. the laptop is a HP Pavilion g6-1032eg
2012-04-22T18:31:00.000Z	zykotick9	bbbbbbbb	ok, just curious if it was ATI.  best of luck.
