2010-09-24T04:16:00.000Z	kevr		Don't joke yourself.
2010-09-24T04:16:00.000Z	kevr		It is illegal content.

2010-09-24T04:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kevr	not all torrents are illegal
2010-09-24T04:17:00.000Z	kevr	ActionParsnip	obviously
2010-09-24T04:17:00.000Z	kevr	ActionParsnip	but all the mp3 rips of real artists, are
2010-09-24T04:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kevr	no, they can happily give away their own material, myspace allows fully legal mp3 downloads
2010-09-24T04:18:00.000Z	kevr	ActionParsnip	thats because myspace got licenses to do so, but torrents don't - find me one legal torrent music rip
2010-09-24T04:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kevr	still a legal mp3 by "real" bands
2010-09-24T04:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kevr	if the artists give the songs away for free its fine, not all big bands charge
2010-09-24T04:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kevr	http://bt.etree.org/   completely free bootleg recordings of unknown artists, completely free
2010-09-24T04:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kevr	just because you don't know about it doesn;t mean it doesn't exist
2010-09-24T04:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kevr	try being less ignorant, you'll get further in life
2010-09-24T04:28:00.000Z	kevr	ActionParsnip	sorry, i just find it funny when people act like they only download legal torrents. It's called pirating, one way or another, you have illegal files after doing more than a few times -- furthermore, im a proud company-ripoff - Thanks for your goods, I'm not paying $450.00 for a M$ application/os. Ever.
2010-09-24T04:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kevr	if the artists and production are giving the files away for free, its not pirating.
2010-09-24T04:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kevr	oh absolutely but legal ones do completely exist (like the ubuntu iso for one ;))
2010-09-24T04:44:00.000Z	kevr	ActionParsnip	btw, sorry if i came off rude - was just in a bit of a hurry to get to the shower
2010-09-24T04:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kevr	me too dude, we both sucked :)
