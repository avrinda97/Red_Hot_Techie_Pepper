2009-01-20T10:14:00.000Z	Pandemic187		My Internet connection is sooo slow and I can't figure out why. Someone tell me what's wrong!
2009-01-20T10:15:00.000Z	n8tuser	Pandemic187	-> did you pay for high speed access or low speed access?
2009-01-20T10:15:00.000Z	Pandemic187	n8tuser	No, it's broadband. It should be decently fast but it's not. The thing is that I'm in college and it's fine on my roommate's laptop, but not on mine.
2009-01-20T10:16:00.000Z	n8tuser	Pandemic187	-> you been messing with your roomates gf, he put a hex on you..lol
2009-01-20T10:16:00.000Z	n8tuser	Pandemic187	-> well what do you consider slow?
2009-01-20T10:16:00.000Z	Pandemic187	n8tuser	97kbps downstream.
2009-01-20T10:17:00.000Z	n8tuser	Pandemic187	-> what if the remote end dishing out towards you is slow? you can not do much about that..
2009-01-20T10:18:00.000Z	Pandemic187	n8tuser	But if what you are describing is true, wouldn't it be slow for my roommate as well?
2009-01-20T10:18:00.000Z	n8tuser	Pandemic187	-> is it same site? so having multiple access to that remote site maybe putting on a priority basis ?
2009-01-20T10:19:00.000Z	Pandemic187	n8tuser	Is what the same site? I ran speed tests in the same room.
2009-01-20T10:19:00.000Z	n8tuser	Pandemic187	-> its also possible your school is putting a cap on your accesses?
2009-01-20T10:19:00.000Z	Pandemic187	n8tuser	Nah. I've been using it for about 2 & 1/2 years now. This is something else.
2009-01-20T10:20:00.000Z	n8tuser	Pandemic187	-> any recent updates?
2009-01-20T10:20:00.000Z	Pandemic187	n8tuser	It's just as slow on Windows as it is on Linux, for the record.
2009-01-20T10:20:00.000Z	n8tuser	Pandemic187	-> okay, are your nameserver functioning ?
2009-01-20T10:21:00.000Z	Pandemic187	n8tuser	Is that an IRC thing? I'm not sure what nameserver means.
2009-01-20T10:22:00.000Z	n8tuser	Pandemic187	-> nameservers is essential to your enjoyment of the internet
2009-01-20T10:22:00.000Z	n8tuser	Pandemic187	-> kindly google for that word, nameserver and get some explanation
2009-01-20T10:24:00.000Z	Pandemic187	n8tuser	So can you tell me how to check if my nameserver is functioning?
