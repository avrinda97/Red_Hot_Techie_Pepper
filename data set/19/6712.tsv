2008-04-27T08:41:00.000Z	amenado		AaronShaf-> you know there is no going back once you upgrade, but installing in a separate partition, you can always delete
2008-04-27T08:42:00.000Z	amenado		deformation-> what kit policy?  are those partitions not mentioned in your new  /etc/fstab?
2008-04-27T08:44:00.000Z	amenado		deformation-> then you may have to modify your /etc/fstab to get them mounted automatically at boot
2008-04-27T08:44:00.000Z	amenado		Sebboh-> look into man pages,  man update-alternatives
2008-04-27T08:45:00.000Z	amenado		deformation-> man fstab,  anyhow edit /etc/fstab and add entry for partitions not loaded at boot
2008-04-27T08:46:00.000Z	amenado		ubuntung-pinoy-> can you ping the smtp host?
2008-04-27T08:47:00.000Z	amenado		deformation-> please man fstab so you have at least an understanding what those entries meant
2008-04-27T08:47:00.000Z	amenado		deformation-> yes, please use pastebin to paste /etc/fstab
2008-04-27T08:48:00.000Z	amenado		Chris|-> did you remember paying for one? any indications like antennae input ports?
