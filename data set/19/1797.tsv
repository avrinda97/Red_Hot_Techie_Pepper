2010-11-05T23:40:00.000Z	petan	Jordan_U	not I do not think so the drive works
2010-11-05T23:41:00.000Z	Jordan_U	petan	But it certainly does not have a partition table, which may break some assumptions made by the auto mounter.
2010-11-05T23:41:00.000Z	petan	Jordan_U	why do you think that
2010-11-05T23:42:00.000Z	petan	Jordan_U	why you think it does not have partition? it is unneccessary auto mount works for drives like that
2010-11-05T23:43:00.000Z	Jordan_U	petan	He does not have any sdb1, only sdb. And since he can mount "sdb" directly it means that he has no partition table, just a filesystem starting at the beginning of the drive.
2010-11-05T23:43:00.000Z	petan	Jordan_U	it is flash drive those are formated like that it is ok
2010-11-05T23:44:00.000Z	Jordan_U	petan	Some flash drives are formatted this way, but most aren't (and I personally think none should be). While the automounter should still work reliably in this case I wouldn't be surprised if this case isn't tested very often.
2010-11-11T15:35:00.000Z	petan	Jordan_U	why you tell me that?
2010-11-11T15:35:00.000Z	Jordan_U	petan	Because Ubuntu 10.04 does not have a /boot/grub/menu.lst
2010-11-11T15:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U	petan	His problem is almost certainly that he followed directions that were unclear and used the wrong option for the --root-directory= parameter of grub install. I see it a lot. His grub.cfg is fine.
2010-11-11T15:38:00.000Z	Jordan_U	petan	I may get disconnected as I'm having ISP issues, but please get U-b-u-n-t-u to follow this guide http://grub.enbug.org/Grub2LiveCdInstallGuide and install to the mbr, like /dev/sda, and *not* to a partition like /dev/sda1.
2010-11-11T15:39:00.000Z	Jordan_U	petan	It's more steps than some other ways of installing grub, but it leaves less oportunity for mistakes.
2010-11-11T16:44:00.000Z	Jordan_U	petan	By completing that guide successfully he is almost guaranteed to have a working grub install now. That's why I like that guide.
2010-11-11T16:45:00.000Z	petan	Jordan_U	but he got errors? but guide is good, thank you
2010-11-11T16:46:00.000Z	Jordan_U	petan	The errors were due to simple mistakes. The fact that grub-install has completed, and he has a grub.cfg, is enough to be fairly sure everything is going to work.
2010-11-11T16:47:00.000Z	petan	Jordan_U	but what if grub.cfg is wrong
2010-11-11T16:48:00.000Z	Jordan_U	petan	I guess I was wrong.
2010-11-11T16:49:00.000Z	Jordan_U	petan	The syntax has changed with grub2.
2010-11-11T16:59:00.000Z	Jordan_U	petan	/mnt/dev and /mnt/proc
