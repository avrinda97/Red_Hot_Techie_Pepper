2007-04-12T06:52:00.000Z	zilly6_		is feisty gonna have good smp support?
2007-04-12T06:53:00.000Z	HOT	zilly6_	funny you should ask, i just installed on a turion x2 and its picked up a SMP kernel for me and everything seems fine
2007-04-12T06:55:00.000Z	HOT	zilly6_	i didnt have to do anything, i just installed and got  2.6.20-14-generic #2 SMP kernel by default
2007-04-12T06:57:00.000Z	HOT	zilly6_	broadly speaking linux is SMP aware, so i can watch CPU threading all the time without any specific application support, im not an expert but from what i understand all apps "support" SMP, i tihnk the only decision you need to make is fiesty 32 or 64, i went with 32 for now just to be safe
2007-04-12T06:59:00.000Z	HOT	zilly6_	good question :) , i think i was just paranoid from getting stung with windows, if i get round to it i will reinstall with 64 bit
2007-04-12T07:01:00.000Z	HOT	zilly6_	agreed, altough you have to ask yourself what you are gaining with 64bit, i cant break the 4GB block on my home pc anyway, but at work i run Sun Grid over a RHEL4 cluster and we only use 64bit, never had a single compatability problem
2007-04-12T07:02:00.000Z	HOT	zilly6_	on balance i would go for 64 bit and test it if your doing a new install
2007-04-12T07:03:00.000Z	HOT	zilly6_	i think its a question of try it and see for now, we use 64bit at work because our cluster nodes have 32GB of RAM each, but that was the only factor for going 64bit
2007-04-12T07:21:00.000Z	HOT	zilly6_	not really, i strongly recommend disable ipv6 lookup though, its makes firefox much much faster
2007-04-12T07:24:00.000Z	HOT	zilly6_	you might want to do IPV6 disable = true as well
