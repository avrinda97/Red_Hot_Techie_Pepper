2006-06-30T05:55:00.000Z	Draconicus		All the serious problems are being ignored, while all the newbies are getting help. I ask questions whose answers aren't documented elsewhere. I hate to beg for attention, but this is getting ridiculous. :\
2006-06-30T05:56:00.000Z	PacketScan	Draconicus	What is your problem?
2006-06-30T05:57:00.000Z	Draconicus	PacketScan	I have two. Which would you rather cover? Nautilus being retarded, or Java not working after Sun JRE was installed from the multiverse repository?
2006-06-30T05:58:00.000Z	PacketScan	Draconicus	First Nautilus is always buggy we can work on that. , Java  runtime?  is yes should be installed directly from sun.
2006-06-30T05:59:00.000Z	PacketScan	Draconicus	what are the issues you are having with nautilus
2006-06-30T06:00:00.000Z	Draconicus	PacketScan	Well, it was running quite happily for a couple weeks, now. I played with GTK-Gnutella and mplayer off and on during this time. Suddenly it decided to have a seizure, and after I restarted it for the fifth time, it continues to give nothing but a blank window that acts like it's lagging to hell. This, of course, means that I have no desktop as well.
2006-06-30T06:02:00.000Z	PacketScan	Draconicus	Have you cleared your Nautlius Temp files yet?
2006-06-30T06:02:00.000Z	Draconicus	PacketScan	Oh.. No, I haven't. Where are they stored? Is there a command or do I have to wipe the directory with rm -r >
2006-06-30T06:03:00.000Z	PacketScan	Draconicus	right
2006-06-30T06:03:00.000Z	Draconicus	PacketScan	Um... That was multiple choice... :P
2006-06-30T06:05:00.000Z	PacketScan	Draconicus	what's your username?
2006-06-30T06:05:00.000Z	Draconicus	PacketScan	glitch
2006-06-30T06:07:00.000Z	Draconicus	PacketScan	Well, gee, you could have just told me they were in .nautilus. I know my way around. Thanks for the help, though. :)
2006-06-30T06:08:00.000Z	PacketScan	Draconicus	you said it was multipul choice  i didn't want you confused :d
2006-06-30T06:08:00.000Z	Draconicus	PacketScan	:P
2006-06-30T06:09:00.000Z	Draconicus	PacketScan	Eh... That didn't do it, it seems.
2006-10-08T05:57:00.000Z	PacketScan	Draconicus	do you have the cue ?
2006-10-08T05:57:00.000Z	Draconicus	PacketScan	Yes. K3B says the operation isn't permitted, though.
2006-10-08T06:02:00.000Z	Draconicus	PacketScan	Oh. Now I see what you meant. Lemme check that path.
