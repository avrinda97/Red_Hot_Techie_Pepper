2008-08-30T03:40:00.000Z	Gman99999		I'm having big issues with my video drive and compiz and awn, if there's anyone who feel's they're smart enough to tackle this one by all means, here's a summary of what's happened http://www.planetblur.org/hosted/awnforum/index.php?shard=forum&action=g_reply&ID=2012&page=1&isLive=true
2008-08-30T03:41:00.000Z	Gman99999		Nvidia
2008-08-30T03:41:00.000Z	Gman99999		gainsutra nvidia
2008-08-30T03:41:00.000Z	Gman99999		ok
2008-08-30T03:41:00.000Z	__mikem	Gman99999	are you having trouble getting your nvidia card to work
2008-08-30T03:42:00.000Z	Gman99999	__mikem	Ive had it working for a while until I tried to get awn working in kde, then the glx driver started taking over
2008-08-30T03:42:00.000Z	__mikem	Gman99999	reinstall the driver?
2008-08-30T03:42:00.000Z	Gman99999	__mikem	I don't want the glx driver anymore, how do i get the nvidia one to work now?
2008-08-30T03:43:00.000Z	Gman99999	__mikem	I was told by people that if im using the glx driver to not go and uninstall it while your still using it, but i can't seem to switch to the nvidia one anyway
2008-08-30T03:44:00.000Z	__mikem	Gman99999	drop to the root recovery shell
2008-08-30T03:44:00.000Z	Gman99999	__mikem	ok then what do i do?
2008-08-30T03:44:00.000Z	__mikem	Gman99999	start ubuntu in recovery mode, uninstall it, then reinstall it
2008-08-30T03:45:00.000Z	Gman99999	__mikem	re-install the nvidia driver?
2008-08-30T03:45:00.000Z	__mikem	Gman99999	yes
2008-08-30T03:45:00.000Z	Gman99999	__mikem	why do it in recovery as opposed to normally here in synaptic?
2008-08-30T03:46:00.000Z	__mikem	Gman99999	because in recovery mode you will be in text mode so you won't be running the driver
2008-08-30T03:46:00.000Z	Gman99999	__mikem	hmmm Im not that good with command line stuff
2008-08-30T03:46:00.000Z	Gman99999	__mikem	I wouldn't know what to enter
2008-08-30T03:49:00.000Z	Gman99999	__mikem	is there a way that I can do it in the gui?
