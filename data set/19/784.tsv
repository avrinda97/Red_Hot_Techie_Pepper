2011-10-14T22:39:00.000Z	Tixos		is it simply that package that needs installing, or any other modifications to be made?
2011-10-14T22:40:00.000Z	Tixos		gnome3 crashed in beta2, i reported bugs, not fixed..
2011-10-14T22:41:00.000Z	Tixos		man, i waited 5 days with a freshly built PC, for the release, to save me reinstalling, as im running a fully encrypted system
2011-10-14T22:41:00.000Z	Tixos		#hardware go here
2011-10-14T22:42:00.000Z	Tixos		are the devs trying to force us to use unity, by screwing up the gnome-shell package?

2011-10-14T22:46:00.000Z	dr_willis	Tixos	 this is support channel - not a complaint channel..

2011-10-14T22:53:00.000Z	dr_willis	Tixos	 im just now installing on my new desktop. my other beta box has been headless for 2 weeks. :)
2011-10-14T22:53:00.000Z	Tixos	dr_willis	ok, no idea whats up, it was the same on beta for me, and that was on another machine...
2011-11-13T20:27:00.000Z	Tixos	dr_willis	do you have any idea how i can get hold of older proprietary drivers that Jockey provides?
