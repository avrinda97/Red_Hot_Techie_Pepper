2008-07-02T06:58:00.000Z	dolphin_noel	albuntu	nathing because ... the acount simple makes logout ...
2008-07-02T06:59:00.000Z	albuntu	dolphin_noel	try emesene
2008-07-02T07:00:00.000Z	albuntu	dolphin_noel	you can use emesene normally. thats no need for a webcam to make it work
2008-07-02T07:01:00.000Z	dolphin_noel	albuntu	man ... and why not amsn?!
2008-07-02T07:02:00.000Z	albuntu	dolphin_noel	if you dont give the output than you cant say that ubuntu has a bug
2008-07-02T07:04:00.000Z	albuntu	dolphin_noel	why dont you think that this is an amsn bug and you are sure that this is a ubuntu bug ? just find some logs and paste them so someone can help you
2008-07-02T07:09:00.000Z	albuntu	dolphin_noel	take in mind that everyone here is to help each other. and if you dont know how to make ubuntu work that is YOUR FAULT and not someone else. there are DOZENS of documentation that you can read or you can google your problem and find the solution but from what i see you are too lazy
2008-07-02T07:10:00.000Z	albuntu	dolphin_noel	I USE AMSN and works perfectly in ubuntu
2008-07-02T07:14:00.000Z	albuntu	dolphin_noel	if you google a little you find the solution
2008-07-02T07:14:00.000Z	albuntu	dolphin_noel	check this https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/amsn/+bug/190531
2008-07-02T07:14:00.000Z	albuntu	dolphin_noel	or simply try to disable the freewin in compiz
2008-07-02T07:15:00.000Z	dolphin_noel	albuntu	yup that it :) thank you :)
