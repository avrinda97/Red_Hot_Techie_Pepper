2007-02-06T08:41:00.000Z	AdamKili		hey I have a dead computer (nothing happens when i turn it on except the fans run) and I was wondering if it's be ok to put in an Intel Celeron processor in place of the dead computer's AMD Sempron processor, just to check if that is the problem.
2007-02-06T08:41:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle	AdamKili	no.
2007-02-06T08:41:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle	AdamKili	nnononono.
2007-02-06T08:42:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle	AdamKili	Unless you have a Celeron mobo, its not going to fit.
2007-02-06T08:42:00.000Z	AdamKili	Music_Shuffle	and kitche they look like the same socket
2007-02-06T08:42:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle	AdamKili	uhh...look != are.
2007-02-06T08:44:00.000Z	AdamKili	Music_Shuffle	and kitche: you two are right. i hadn't compared the two processors right next to each other yet. so i guess the only two other things I can try to get the comp working is put in a different ram card and try a new graphics card (the original's built in to the motherboard)?
2007-02-06T08:45:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle	AdamKili	well, what happened again?
2007-02-06T08:45:00.000Z	AdamKili	Music_Shuffle	and kitche: my friend's computer broke and he asked me to fix it. nothing at all happens when you turn it on, nothing on the monitor, only the fans run
2007-02-06T08:46:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle	AdamKili	fried board? =/
2007-02-06T08:46:00.000Z	AdamKili	Music_Shuffle	seems like it. so the only option is to buy a new motherboard?
2007-02-06T08:47:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle	AdamKili	eh...what sort of PC is it?
2007-02-06T08:47:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle	AdamKili	if its too old, you might end up spending a large enough amount that its not worth it.
2007-02-06T08:50:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle	AdamKili	No idea what Emachines boards run cost-wise, you might be able to.
2007-02-06T08:51:00.000Z	AdamKili	Music_Shuffle	i have to get a specific board? maybe I can find the same one and not have to reinstall their OS and loose all their data
2007-02-06T08:52:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle	AdamKili	well, no, you can actually find a lot of cheap generic boards that would do the trick quite well for $50-60
2007-02-06T08:54:00.000Z	AdamKili	Music_Shuffle	I'm not a computer builder, so i have no idea what options are open to me, or how to find a motherboard that would be compatible.
2007-02-06T08:57:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle	AdamKili	really, you need a motherboard with the same functionality. So...look for one that supports your processor type, number of hard drives, RAM type and quantity, and any other doodads you have. And you'll be set.
2007-02-06T09:14:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle	AdamKili	best of luck with that. :)
