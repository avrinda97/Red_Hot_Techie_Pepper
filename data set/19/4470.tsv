2010-10-22T06:52:00.000Z	histo	racecar56	advanced format hard drive?
2010-10-22T06:53:00.000Z	histo	racecar56	i'm reading about it now
2010-10-22T06:54:00.000Z	histo	racecar56	advanced format drives keep backwards compatibility
2010-10-22T06:55:00.000Z	racecar56	histo	yeah but then they get really slow, or at least that's what people say
2010-10-22T06:55:00.000Z	histo	racecar56	still checking some things
2010-10-22T06:56:00.000Z	racecar56	histo	ok
2010-10-22T06:56:00.000Z	histo	racecar56	http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.utilities.util-linux-ng/2926
2010-10-22T06:57:00.000Z	histo	racecar56	I believe the new fdisk will partition and format it properly
2010-10-22T06:57:00.000Z	histo	racecar56	looks like anything 2.6.31 and up
2010-10-22T06:57:00.000Z	racecar56	histo	good :)
2010-10-22T06:58:00.000Z	racecar56	histo	i can use gparted to partition if i have to
2010-10-22T06:58:00.000Z	racecar56	histo	so would ubiquity work if i partitioned with it?
2010-10-22T06:58:00.000Z	histo	racecar56	assuming the installer is using a newer kerenl depends what version of ubuntu you install
2010-10-22T06:59:00.000Z	racecar56	histo	10.10, with 2.6.35.something so i assume it'd be fine
2010-10-22T06:59:00.000Z	histo	racecar56	correct
2010-10-22T07:00:00.000Z	racecar56	histo	$2 more for 90 more GB and AFT, that's good
2010-10-22T07:02:00.000Z	racecar56	histo	would it matter if i used GPT instead of MBR?
