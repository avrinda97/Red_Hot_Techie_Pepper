2006-09-05T09:10:00.000Z	gusto5		hey, how do i know if ubuntu is using both my cores in my centrino duo?
2006-09-05T09:10:00.000Z	cliffd	gusto5	do you have smp kernel?
2006-09-05T09:10:00.000Z	gusto5	cliffd	what would that be?
2006-09-05T09:10:00.000Z	cliffd	gusto5	when you do uname -a do you see the letters SMP any where?
2006-09-05T09:12:00.000Z	gusto5	cliffd	nope.
2006-09-05T09:12:00.000Z	cliffd	gusto5	then I would say no its not using it
2006-09-05T09:12:00.000Z	cliffd	gusto5	if you go to synaptic, and scroll down to the linux-686 there should be an smp kernel there.
2006-09-05T09:15:00.000Z	cliffd	gusto5	after you install and reboot come back. I think there are some things and /proc and /sys you can check
2006-09-05T09:20:00.000Z	gusto5	cliffd	im back from full reboot
2006-09-05T09:21:00.000Z	cliffd	gusto5	cat /proc/cpuinfo
2006-09-05T09:21:00.000Z	gusto5	cliffd	yep it looks like its working now. it will show core 0 and core 1
2006-09-05T09:22:00.000Z	cliffd	gusto5	you are set then.
2006-09-05T09:22:00.000Z	gusto5	cliffd	if i delete the 386 entries from grub, will that be a big problem?
2006-09-05T09:22:00.000Z	cliffd	gusto5	also, did you install the 386 or the 686?
2006-09-05T09:23:00.000Z	cliffd	gusto5	no not at all. but its always safe to leave an extra just incase... but you know the 686 smp works because you are using it now
2006-09-05T09:23:00.000Z	gusto5	cliffd	ok. so i am all set now?
2006-09-05T09:23:00.000Z	cliffd	gusto5	i would say so. unless anyone else has anything to add about getting dual cores working... just SMP right?
2006-09-05T09:23:00.000Z	gusto5	cliffd	all looks good. system resources also shows it.
2006-09-05T09:24:00.000Z	cliffd	gusto5	good deal. everything should be working.   you are welcome.
