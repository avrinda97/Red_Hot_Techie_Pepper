2011-04-10T19:57:00.000Z	DarkAce		Sorry, but my bugs is not for a package it's in general for ubuntu
2011-04-10T19:58:00.000Z	DarkAce		but not security vulnérability
2011-04-10T19:58:00.000Z	erUSUL	DarkAce	explain a little the bug. we may be able to tell you what package it aplies to
2011-04-10T20:02:00.000Z	DarkAce	erUSUL	: OK ; It's easy, lauch a dowload with a size more than you harddrive can be stock, and in a terminal lauch command : sudo shutdown -h +... ; and leave your laptop; when you go back to your laptop. he is stop, and if you try to boot, your ubuntu can't open because you harddrive is full.
2011-04-10T20:04:00.000Z	erUSUL	DarkAce	well we can fight user errors ... if you do « sudo  rm » with the wrong options the system is destroyed too
2011-04-10T20:05:00.000Z	erUSUL	DarkAce	anyway ext4 should reserve espace for the superuser ( 5% ) so that problem does not happen
2011-04-10T20:07:00.000Z	DarkAce	erUSUL	sorry but i use ext4 :)
2011-04-10T20:08:00.000Z	erUSUL	DarkAce	really dunno
2011-04-10T20:10:00.000Z	DarkAce	erUSUL	but if you think it's normal and not a bug, it's ok, for me, but it's dangerous to have not a small space to boot
2011-04-10T20:10:00.000Z	erUSUL	DarkAce	check from livecd... mount the partition and see if there is any space left ( reserved )
2011-04-10T20:13:00.000Z	DarkAce	erUSUL	ok i check :)
2011-04-10T20:13:00.000Z	DarkAce	erUSUL	just a question, have you tested the livecd for beta Natty, please ?
2011-04-10T20:13:00.000Z	erUSUL	DarkAce	no; i haven't
2011-04-10T20:14:00.000Z	DarkAce	erUSUL	ok, thank you, because when i use impossible to have UNITY (just to see the difference with Gnome)
2011-04-10T20:16:00.000Z	DarkAce	erUSUL	about my problem or bug i don't know the really name, if in the first installtion if you don't use the recommanded partition (with hom on the same partition with system) you can have any problem :)
2011-04-10T20:17:00.000Z	erUSUL	DarkAce	as i said i caonsider this a users error
2011-04-10T20:17:00.000Z	DarkAce	erUSUL	i think in standard in recommanded mode, canonical will be choose two partition for home and system
2011-04-10T20:18:00.000Z	DarkAce	erUSUL	thank you for your help, bye bye
2011-04-10T20:19:00.000Z	erUSUL	DarkAce	no problem
