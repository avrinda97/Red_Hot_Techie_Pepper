2005-03-12T09:32:00.000Z	jdub	Quarupt	have you installed the amd64 version?
2005-03-12T09:35:00.000Z	Quarupt	jdub	i can just use the 32bit version if the 64bit one wont allow me to run 32 bit apps
2005-03-12T09:36:00.000Z	jdub	Quarupt	if you're running the amd64 version, you have a 64 bit kernel. if you're running the i386 version, you have a 32 bit kernel.
2005-03-12T09:39:00.000Z	Quarupt	jdub	Is there a way to upgrade, and if i do can i still run 386 apps?
2005-03-12T12:21:00.000Z	jdub	Quarupt	no, you can't. only vnc.
2005-03-13T13:07:00.000Z	jdub	Quarupt	welcome to the development branch. expect bugs.
