2008-01-28T18:57:00.000Z	L3ttuc3		ah you know my ubuntu died on me. sadly im back in win xp to back up some stuff before i reinstall ubuntu.
2008-01-28T18:57:00.000Z	L3ttuc3		man i hate this.
2008-01-28T18:58:00.000Z	bazhang	L3ttuc3	what is the issue
2008-01-28T19:02:00.000Z	L3ttuc3	bazhang	not entired sure, but i think there were issues with my usb disk. kept getting kernel messages about the module resetting the device, and latterly, during a second ubuntu install, of IO errors.
2008-01-28T19:03:00.000Z	L3ttuc3	bazhang	so now, im going to zap my internal hard disk with the windows partition once i've backed up the data on there. i cant back up to the usb drive because that seems to have issues, one way or another, so dvds it is.
2008-01-28T19:03:00.000Z	bazhang	L3ttuc3	good luck ;]
2008-01-28T19:04:00.000Z	L3ttuc3	bazhang	bah. thanks. i hope that that _was_ the problem, and there weren't deeper issues. anyone get funny messages from the kernel modules with usb disks?
2008-02-11T18:35:00.000Z	bazhang	L3ttuc3	should work
2008-02-11T18:36:00.000Z	L3ttuc3	bazhang	ok, that's for the USB part, but the keys are a little different, no windows keys for example (i can reconfigure most of my compiz hotkeys no problems...) but will i have other issues to bear in mind?
2008-02-11T18:37:00.000Z	bazhang	L3ttuc3	never used a desktop mac kb; had ubuntu running on a mac laptop however cant really remember as compiz was in its infancy at that point ;]
2008-02-11T18:38:00.000Z	L3ttuc3	bazhang	that's my issue, you installed from scratch with that keyboard already in place, so you would already have set it up at install time, im wondering if im going to have to pick my brains to get it to work properly...
2008-02-11T18:38:00.000Z	bazhang	L3ttuc3	doubtful as apple just uses standard stuff these days and slaps a shiny label on it
2008-02-11T18:39:00.000Z	L3ttuc3	bazhang	that keyboard is more than just shiny! i'll look for a picture and post it, if you all don't mind, just to showh you. it's real real slim.
2008-02-11T18:40:00.000Z	bazhang	L3ttuc3	best post it in offtopic ;]
2008-02-11T18:40:00.000Z	L3ttuc3	bazhang	yeah, will do that :P i'm there too.
2008-02-13T20:17:00.000Z	L3ttuc3	bazhang	something about inability to unload something. i know this sounds vague, im trying to find out where logs of the error message is so i can be more specific.
2008-02-13T20:17:00.000Z	bazhang	L3ttuc3	I would ignore it--I get that sometimes as well
2008-02-13T20:18:00.000Z	L3ttuc3	bazhang	i get it inconsistently. that does not affect shutdown usually.
2008-02-25T22:18:00.000Z	bazhang	L3ttuc3	haha
