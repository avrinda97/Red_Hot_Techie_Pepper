2008-03-23T09:21:00.000Z	RioMerc		Two ports on the same card
2008-03-23T09:21:00.000Z	RioMerc		I presume I'm fucked?
2008-03-23T09:21:00.000Z	RioMerc		Apologies
2008-03-23T09:22:00.000Z	RioMerc		Forgot about that, I'm used to the over-18 internet :)
2008-03-23T09:22:00.000Z	RioMerc		Tried
2008-03-23T09:22:00.000Z	RioMerc		It only clones the two desktops
2008-03-23T09:23:00.000Z	RioMerc		Allow me to specify what I mean by dual monitors
2008-03-23T09:23:00.000Z	RioMerc		Extended monitors
2008-03-23T09:23:00.000Z	RioMerc		So that the two act as one big screen
2008-03-23T09:23:00.000Z	RioMerc		Ati
2008-03-23T09:24:00.000Z	Dr_willis	RioMerc	 what is your video card setup?
2008-03-23T09:24:00.000Z	RioMerc	Dr_willis	Hmm?
2008-03-23T09:25:00.000Z	Dr_willis		Nvidia and Twinview - is rather easy to setup a wide desktop, or clones, or other ways
2008-03-23T09:25:00.000Z	RioMerc		x_x
2008-03-23T09:25:00.000Z	RioMerc		Sort of, druke
2008-03-23T09:25:00.000Z	RioMerc		Found out about MergedBuffer, Twinview and all of that
2008-03-23T09:25:00.000Z	RioMerc		I even tried out a MergedBuffer config using a tutorial, much phail for me
2008-03-23T09:25:00.000Z	RioMerc		Lucky Nvidia users, why do they get all the support :(
2008-03-23T09:26:00.000Z	Dr_willis	RioMerc	twinview is nvidia only - if you are using ati. I got no idea then. :)
