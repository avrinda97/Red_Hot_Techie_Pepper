2008-02-08T16:42:00.000Z	Thurin1	Rodolfo	Nvidia from my experience works better on Linux than ATI.
2008-02-08T16:42:00.000Z	Rodolfo	Thurin1	what card family are you talking about?
2008-02-08T16:43:00.000Z	Thurin1	Rodolfo	You're comparing games on windows and linux?
2008-02-08T16:43:00.000Z	Thurin1	Rodolfo	Bah, might as well compare apples and oranges really
2008-02-08T16:43:00.000Z	Rodolfo	Thurin1	hehe...yea I need a suggestion to buy a new video card with my next computer
2008-02-08T16:44:00.000Z	Rodolfo	Thurin1	I've had bad experience enough and I'm running away from intel GMA-based-cards from now on...
2008-02-08T16:44:00.000Z	Thurin1	Rodolfo	Hahah
2008-02-08T16:45:00.000Z	Thurin1	Rodolfo	Well... as for Linux... yeah, Nvidia is the way to go.. trust me.. ATI is hella bad.
2008-02-08T16:45:00.000Z	Rodolfo	Thurin1	I see...I was talking about GF 7300LE. what do you think about it? is it capable of running current games?
2008-02-08T16:46:00.000Z	Thurin1	Rodolfo	On Linux? hah sure
2008-02-08T16:46:00.000Z	Thurin1	Rodolfo	Linux doesn't have much games you know :P
2008-02-08T16:46:00.000Z	Rodolfo	Thurin1	because I don't want vista on my next pc...trust me Linux is the smarter choice.
2008-02-08T16:47:00.000Z	Thurin1	Rodolfo	Not for Gamers it isn't
2008-02-08T16:47:00.000Z	Rodolfo	Thurin1	and I want to run games on Linux...If I can't, nothing to do about it. windows is not an option.
2008-02-08T16:48:00.000Z	Thurin1	Rodolfo	Ok well good luck with that
2008-02-08T16:48:00.000Z	Rodolfo	Thurin1	thanks :)
2008-02-08T16:49:00.000Z	Rodolfo	Thurin1	why not use an "emulator"? cedega does it well...
2008-02-08T16:49:00.000Z	Thurin1	Rodolfo	FreeBSD is not Linux so.. yah
