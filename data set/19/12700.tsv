2005-07-21T11:38:00.000Z	emX	tomchuk	?? no X?
2005-07-21T11:38:00.000Z	tomchuk	emX	 no xterm
2005-07-21T11:38:00.000Z	tomchuk	emX	 it's a seperate package, and not installed by default on Debian
2005-07-21T11:39:00.000Z	emX	tomchuk	i though it was part of x-window-system-core...
2005-07-21T11:40:00.000Z	tomchuk	emX	 not on the new xorg packages in Sid
2005-07-21T11:40:00.000Z	emX	tomchuk	hmm.
2005-07-21T11:40:00.000Z	tomchuk	emX	 er, rather I think the dep is a virtual for x-terminal-emulator
2005-07-21T11:41:00.000Z	tomchuk	emX	 I already had aterm installed
2005-07-21T11:41:00.000Z	emX	tomchuk	maybe the switch to xorg changed it. my memory's faulty, i guess.
2005-07-21T11:41:00.000Z	emX	tomchuk	i'm quite the fan of aterm myself.
2005-07-21T11:41:00.000Z	tomchuk	emX	 yeah can't get enough of it with a tweaked .Xdefaults and proggy fonts
2005-07-21T11:42:00.000Z	emX	tomchuk	which fonts are you using? i'm not totally happy with mine
2005-07-21T11:42:00.000Z	tomchuk	emX	 proggy clean slashed-zero bold punctuation
2005-07-21T11:43:00.000Z	tomchuk	emX	 http://www.proggyfonts.com/
2005-07-21T11:43:00.000Z	emX	tomchuk	tx...
2005-07-21T11:44:00.000Z	emX	tomchuk	pardon the (rather) silly question, but i don't use X all that much. how'd you install your fonts?
2005-07-21T11:45:00.000Z	tomchuk	emX	 copy them to /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/misc for the pcf fonts
2005-07-21T11:45:00.000Z	emX	tomchuk	tx.
2005-07-21T11:45:00.000Z	tomchuk	emX	 the ttf fonts from that site are hideous
