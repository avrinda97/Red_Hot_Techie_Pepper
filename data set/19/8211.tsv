2007-04-25T14:37:00.000Z	jock_		Have problems clean installing Feisty with CD. I get message: /bin/sh: can't access tty; job control turned off. It's my daughters computer. I have tested the CD on my computer and there is no problem. We tried to update her Feisty yesterday and the computer would not boot at all anymore. Is there a bug in the new Ubuntu and could somebody please help. I do not have much technical know how. Thank you.

2007-04-25T14:39:00.000Z	jock_	Parmenion	used my computer and test function on cd.
2007-04-25T14:41:00.000Z	Parmenion	jock_	you have installed ubuntu on your daughter's computer already?
2007-04-25T14:41:00.000Z	jock_	Parmenion	Edubuntu edgy
2007-04-25T14:43:00.000Z	jock_	Parmenion	As soon as I try to boot the live cd or anyhting from the start.
2007-04-25T14:44:00.000Z	jock_	Parmenion	I would have preferred to clean install now, but I might have to try the update to Feisty again.
2007-04-25T14:45:00.000Z	Parmenion	jock_	check out the md5 sum of the iso
2007-04-25T14:45:00.000Z	Parmenion	jock_	it would be easier to do a clean install as far as i know

2007-04-25T14:48:00.000Z	jock_	Parmenion	I do not know where to find the Md5 of Edubuntu Feisty. Can't find it on their home page. No problem finding it from my downlod.

2007-04-25T14:54:00.000Z	jock_	Parmenion	Thanx for that I check and see. LOL
2007-04-25T14:55:00.000Z	Parmenion	jock_	anytime XD ill be hanging round here for a good while yet
2007-04-25T15:19:00.000Z	jock_	Parmenion	Hope you are still there. The check sum on my download was nothing what it was supposed to be. Nothing was the same. Yet when I ran the disc check it said it was ok. Any idea what is going on here?
2007-04-25T15:23:00.000Z	jock_	Parmenion	I don't know much about Md5 sums. I will re download. I just wonder how this sort of thing comes about. Excuse my ignorance.
2007-04-25T15:23:00.000Z	Parmenion	jock_	no, dont apologise! at least your interested in whats the problem unlike most people around
2007-04-25T15:29:00.000Z	jock_	Parmenion	I am glad it is not the fault of Ubuntu. I love that distro and realy did not want to go anywhere else. My daughter too, but she rely wants 3D. (11 years old)LOL. Thank you again, very much appreciated.
2007-04-25T15:29:00.000Z	Parmenion	jock_	your welcome =) I myself have to thank the people out here who helped me out with my own problems
