2006-12-23T09:34:00.000Z	Saxofoner		Guys, I was trying to update my system yesterday, and update notifier interrupted, and I tried to do a sudo apt-get today, and I got this: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/38516/
2006-12-23T09:35:00.000Z	un_operateur	Saxofoner	the freecontrib servers are down -- you need to remove those entries from your sources.list
2006-12-23T10:00:00.000Z	un_operateur	Saxofoner	pastebin those errors please
2006-12-23T10:10:00.000Z	Saxofoner	un_operateur	 That's done!  The errors are gone, but Nautilus is still fubar!
2006-12-23T10:16:00.000Z	un_operateur	Saxofoner	have you tried reinstalling nautlius?
2006-12-23T10:16:00.000Z	Saxofoner	un_operateur	 how?
2006-12-23T10:17:00.000Z	un_operateur	Saxofoner	sudo sh -c "aptitude remove nautilus; aptitude install nautilus"
2006-12-23T10:20:00.000Z	Saxofoner	un_operateur	I'M Baaaaccccck!   What was that you were saying about the reinstalling nautilus?
2006-12-23T10:21:00.000Z	un_operateur	Saxofoner	you'll need to get to the terminal and do -- sudo sh -c "aptitude remove nautilus; aptitude install nautilus"

2006-12-23T10:24:00.000Z	Saxofoner	un_operateur	 do those errors (http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/38519/) make sense to you?
2006-12-23T10:24:00.000Z	un_operateur	Saxofoner	just to make sure we are on the same page -- you must have killed all desktop applications and be at the terminal
2006-12-23T10:25:00.000Z	Saxofoner	un_operateur	 how to kill all desktop apps and still be in xchat?
2006-12-23T10:25:00.000Z	un_operateur	Saxofoner	CTRL+ALT+F1 -- login there -- and run  -- sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop  -- then run this -- sudo sh -c "aptitude remove nautilus ubuntu-desktop; aptitude install nautilus"
2006-12-23T10:26:00.000Z	un_operateur	Saxofoner	you cant -- you'll need to skip xchat for a few minutes
2006-12-23T10:34:00.000Z	un_operateur	Saxofoner	what does borked mean? how is nautilus misbehaving? can you show us a screenshot of the problem? etc
2006-12-23T10:35:00.000Z	Saxofoner	un_operateur	 Sure, I'll post a screenshot.  Borked was just the word that thoreauputic used in place of another 4 + 2 letter word.
2006-12-23T10:36:00.000Z	un_operateur	Saxofoner	that'll help
2006-12-23T10:40:00.000Z	un_operateur	Saxofoner	you could try purging the ~/.nautilus directory
