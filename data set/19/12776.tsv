2005-11-02T08:39:00.000Z	sexcopter8000m		hi, does anyone know about mldonkey? i want to try it, have installed packages "mldonkey-server" and "mldonkey-gui" and can't get any further :s
2005-11-02T08:39:00.000Z	defcon8	sexcopter8000m	yes
2005-11-02T08:39:00.000Z	defcon8	sexcopter8000m	install kmldonkey aswell for your gui
2005-11-02T08:41:00.000Z	sexcopter8000m	defcon8	ok, have installed kmldonkey, now how do i launch it?
2005-11-02T08:42:00.000Z	defcon8	sexcopter8000m	kmldonkey in the terminal
2005-11-02T08:48:00.000Z	sexcopter8000m	defcon8	i get an error "Connection to the core was refused. Are you sure it is running?"
2005-11-02T08:48:00.000Z	sexcopter8000m	defcon8	and i pointed it to the mlnet file in the setup
2005-11-02T08:48:00.000Z	defcon8	sexcopter8000m	sorry, run mlnet first
2005-11-02T08:49:00.000Z	defcon8	sexcopter8000m	and when configging kmldonkey you can find the path of mlnet with ' whereis mlnet ' in the terminal
2005-11-02T08:49:00.000Z	sexcopter8000m	defcon8	ah, ok :)
2005-11-02T08:49:00.000Z	defcon8	sexcopter8000m	without the ' s
2005-11-02T08:49:00.000Z	sexcopter8000m	defcon8	it's ok i found mlnet ok, but i use slocate to find stuff. what's the difference with whereis?
2005-11-02T08:50:00.000Z	defcon8	sexcopter8000m	i dunno i have always used whereis. finds stuff real quick
2005-11-02T08:50:00.000Z	defcon8	sexcopter8000m	it looks in the binary path, doesnt actually search for it
2005-11-02T08:51:00.000Z	sexcopter8000m	defcon8	can kmldonkey connect to soulseek?
2005-11-02T08:53:00.000Z	defcon8	sexcopter8000m	no, but mldonkey can and kmldonkey happens to be a mldonkey client :D
2005-11-02T08:53:00.000Z	sexcopter8000m	defcon8	that's what i meant :P so do you know how i can do this? do i have to find the soulseek server address(es) and just add them?
2005-11-02T08:54:00.000Z	defcon8	sexcopter8000m	no you dont. it will find them for you. just enable soulseek from the settings
2005-11-02T08:54:00.000Z	sexcopter8000m	defcon8	ah, found it, cheers :)
