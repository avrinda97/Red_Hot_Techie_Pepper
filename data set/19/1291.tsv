2011-03-09T16:23:00.000Z	Richzilla		i have a problem with update manager
2011-03-09T16:23:00.000Z	Richzilla		theres an exclamation mark on my gnome panel, and it says either a repo is unavailable, or my network connection is down
2011-03-09T16:24:00.000Z	Richzilla		network connection is fine, but when i manually check for updates (as it suggests) i get this error: http://paste.ubuntu.com/577785/
2011-03-09T16:25:00.000Z	erUSUL	Richzilla	looks like a malformed repo url to me... did you manually edited sources?
2011-03-09T16:26:00.000Z	Richzilla	erUSUL	I wondered, i wasnt sure about the triple forward slash in the url. To my knowledge i havent changed them, but ive added a few repos recently
2011-03-09T16:27:00.000Z	erUSUL	Richzilla	grep -RF "launchpad.net///ubuntu/" /etc/apt/
2011-03-09T16:32:00.000Z	Richzilla	erUSUL	Tried that, same problem. What does it do?
2011-03-09T16:34:00.000Z	erUSUL	Richzilla	tell me/you where the faulty line is
2011-03-09T16:35:00.000Z	Richzilla	erUSUL	i dont get any output
2011-03-09T16:36:00.000Z	erUSUL	Richzilla	take a look at /etc/apt/sources.list and/or files in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/*
2011-03-09T16:39:00.000Z	Richzilla	erUSUL	Found the file, ~maverick.list. am i ok just to replace the triple slashes with single ones?
2011-03-09T16:39:00.000Z	erUSUL	Richzilla	paste the file
2011-03-09T16:40:00.000Z	Richzilla	erUSUL	http://paste.ubuntu.com/577796/
2011-03-09T16:41:00.000Z	erUSUL	Richzilla	even if you put a single / i do not think that repo will work... maverick is an odd name for a ppa
2011-03-09T16:43:00.000Z	Richzilla	erUSUL	Weird
2011-03-09T16:45:00.000Z	erUSUL	Richzilla	i would just remove that file ? what you added it for anyway?
2011-03-09T16:45:00.000Z	Richzilla	erUSUL	i didnt know i had... :)
2011-03-09T16:45:00.000Z	erUSUL	Richzilla	just remove it then
2011-03-09T16:47:00.000Z	Richzilla	erUSUL	problem solved, thanks for the help
