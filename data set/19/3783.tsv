2011-09-30T22:38:00.000Z	neurochrome		hey guys, I messed around with mailutils trying to send email from the terminal, I basically f***ed things up and now evolution wont send emails to hotmail - I get an error "RCPT TO ... failed: Bad recipient address syntax"
2011-09-30T22:38:00.000Z	neurochrome		any ideas on how to fix this?
2011-09-30T22:38:00.000Z	Corey	neurochrome	That's... interesting.
2011-09-30T22:38:00.000Z	neurochrome		yeah, it is
2011-09-30T22:38:00.000Z	Corey	neurochrome	What SMTP server is Evolution set to use, local submission or a remote SMTP box?
2011-09-30T22:39:00.000Z	neurochrome		good question
2011-09-30T22:39:00.000Z	Corey	neurochrome	I liked it.
2011-09-30T22:40:00.000Z	neurochrome	Corey	remote, it should be anyway, but I may have told it to try from local by accident
2011-09-30T22:40:00.000Z	neurochrome	Corey	so how to double-check, and fix ?
2011-09-30T22:40:00.000Z	Corey	neurochrome	Poke around in the account settings?  I don't run Ubuntu on the desktop. :-)
2011-09-30T22:41:00.000Z	neurochrome	Corey	I messed with postfix, and it all went pear shaped
2011-09-30T22:41:00.000Z	Corey	neurochrome	You're in luck then.  /join #postfix
2011-09-30T22:41:00.000Z	neurochrome	Corey	account settings are as they should be in evolution
2011-09-30T22:41:00.000Z	neurochrome		its the underlying system that is hosed
2011-09-30T22:41:00.000Z	Corey	neurochrome	Well, what's the SMTP server set to?  Most clients talk to a remote server and don't care what you're running locally.
2011-09-30T22:41:00.000Z	neurochrome	Corey	how'd I check?
2011-09-30T22:42:00.000Z	neurochrome		What smtp server is evolution using?
2011-09-30T22:42:00.000Z	Corey	neurochrome	Do you see the error in your postfix logs?
2011-09-30T22:43:00.000Z	neurochrome	Corey	there are no logs for postfix as far as I can see
