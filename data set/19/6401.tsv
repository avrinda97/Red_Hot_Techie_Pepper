2008-08-18T21:14:00.000Z	lenswipe		no im just known to always have the last word in an argument
2008-08-18T21:14:00.000Z	lenswipe		now
2008-08-18T21:14:00.000Z	lenswipe		idk
2008-08-18T21:15:00.000Z	lenswipe		which is why very few people actually get help
2008-08-18T21:15:00.000Z	Myrtti	lenswipe	you, now.
2009-09-02T21:42:00.000Z	Myrtti	lenswipe	when helping, be helpful. If you have nothing to say apart from smart comments, then stay quiet so you don't confuse people asking for help
2009-09-02T21:42:00.000Z	Myrtti	lenswipe	sorry
2010-02-09T01:33:00.000Z	Myrtti	lenswipe	good. don't enable the account either
2010-02-09T01:34:00.000Z	Myrtti	lenswipe	then you've voided your warranty - we can't support systems that have root account enabled.
2010-02-09T01:34:00.000Z	Myrtti	lenswipe	it's not the ubuntu way.
2010-02-09T01:34:00.000Z	lenswipe	Myrtti	the hell are you on about? there is no warranty
2010-02-09T01:34:00.000Z	lenswipe	Myrtti	presumably the ubuntu way is to fanny around with sudo - yes?
2010-02-09T01:34:00.000Z	Myrtti	lenswipe	yes.
