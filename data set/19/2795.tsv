2010-01-04T18:10:00.000Z	meway		Hello my wine is not working can someone help me get it to work correctly?
2010-01-04T18:10:00.000Z	Xaero252	meway	whats your issue with wine?
2010-01-04T18:11:00.000Z	meway	Xaero252	any idea of why it may have done that?
2010-01-04T18:12:00.000Z	Xaero252	meway	what exactly is it doing/not doing, does typing in wine on the terminal print usage remarks for wine? does typing winecfg bring up the wine configuration, could you have possibly installed a package dependant on the "wine" package and had the wine1.2 package installed and had your previous wine install get overwritten?
2010-01-04T18:13:00.000Z	meway	Xaero252	 I try to reinstall it and I get the following error
2010-01-04T18:13:00.000Z	meway	Xaero252	 Package dependencies cannot be resolved
2010-01-04T18:13:00.000Z	meway	Xaero252	 This error could be caused by required additional software packages which are missing or not installable. Futhermore there could be a conflict between software packages which are not allowed to be installed at the same time.
2010-01-04T18:14:00.000Z	meway	Xaero252	The problem just occured after looking threw a forum to get my DVD's to work with vlc media player
2010-01-04T18:16:00.000Z	Xaero252	meway	I'm not certain but you must have installed a package that requires something that conflicts with a package wine requires
