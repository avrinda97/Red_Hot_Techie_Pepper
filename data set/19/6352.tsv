2008-02-19T00:44:00.000Z	seyacat		please, help me with one question, how cai i make a search on windows particion? i use locate but mounted particion not index in database
2008-02-19T00:45:00.000Z	danand_	seyacat	- perhaps sudo updatedb might help . try man updatedb first though
2008-02-19T00:46:00.000Z	seyacat	prince_jammys	no i dont know the exact name
2008-02-19T00:47:00.000Z	seyacat	prince_jammys	i know it begins with flex or contais it
2008-02-19T00:49:00.000Z	seyacat	prince_jammys	TY a lot, im making the search now. hope yo works fine :)
2008-02-19T00:50:00.000Z	seyacat	prince_jammys	yes, its work ok, ty you a lot
2008-02-19T00:51:00.000Z	seyacat	prince_jammys	updatedb its not the same as locate -u?
2008-02-19T00:52:00.000Z	danand_	seyacat	- locate uses a database - updatedb updates that database
2008-02-19T00:52:00.000Z	seyacat		dennda: yes i know, but -u update database
2008-02-19T00:53:00.000Z	danand_	seyacat	- i suggested you run that command about ten mins ago :) - guess i should have explained myself better
2008-02-19T00:54:00.000Z	seyacat		locate dont index in database windows mounted partitions, i dont know why
2008-02-19T00:54:00.000Z	seyacat		and find its slow
2008-02-19T00:54:00.000Z	danand_	seyacat	- did you sudo locate -u ?? - think you need to be root to update the db
2008-02-19T00:54:00.000Z	seyacat		yep sudo locate -u and sudo updatedb  too
2008-02-19T00:57:00.000Z	danand_	seyacat	- maybe you need to add an option for the disk you want to add to the db - try man updatedb and see if that helps - let us know if you turn up anything useful
2008-02-19T00:58:00.000Z	seyacat		dennda: yes, i think the problem its in mount options, or in locate config, but i dont find answer on google
2008-02-19T01:02:00.000Z	seyacat		dennda: AAAA jaja, i see what is the problem, windows particion are owned by root, i need to run "sudo locate flex" to run
2008-02-19T01:03:00.000Z	danand_	seyacat	- aaahhh!! that would be it :)
