2007-09-07T16:04:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	croSmiley	whatever you want.
2007-09-07T16:04:00.000Z	croSmiley	Megaqwerty	how do i se passcode on ubuntu?
2007-09-07T16:05:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	croSmiley	when you connect from the phone, a box should pop up on Ubuntu
2007-09-07T16:06:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	croSmiley	if not, make sure you have bluetooth and bluez-utils installed
2007-09-07T16:06:00.000Z	croSmiley	Megaqwerty	i have, and can see my phone but cant connect, since the phoe is asking for a passcode
2007-09-07T16:06:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	croSmiley	oh, the package is called bluez-pin
2007-09-07T16:07:00.000Z	croSmiley	Megaqwerty	I have it
2007-09-07T16:07:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	croSmiley	which side are you initiating the connection from?
2007-09-07T16:08:00.000Z	croSmiley	Megaqwerty	when initiating from ubuntu, phone says that someone is trying to connect and asks for passcode
2007-09-07T16:09:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	croSmiley	how did you initiate from Ubuntu? (I've never figured it out, I always initiate from the phone)
2007-09-07T16:09:00.000Z	croSmiley	Megaqwerty	when trying from phone i see my computer but then it asks again for passcode, and ubuntu doesnt respond
