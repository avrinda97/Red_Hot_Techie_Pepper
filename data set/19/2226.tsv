2010-05-25T06:33:00.000Z	guiniol		hello again
2010-05-25T06:34:00.000Z	guiniol		i have some trouble with gdm
2010-05-25T06:34:00.000Z	guiniol		is this the right channel to get help?
2010-05-25T06:36:00.000Z	guiniol		with the nvidia drivers, when I boot i get in low graphics mode, but if i go to the console and start gdm everything is fine
2010-05-25T06:36:00.000Z	guiniol		is there a way to get around that?
2010-05-25T06:37:00.000Z	afterdark	guiniol	I had the same problem, i had to remove the nvidia drivers and reinstall them
2010-05-25T06:37:00.000Z	guiniol	afterdark	it works the first time i reboot, but then it doesn't
2010-05-25T06:38:00.000Z	guiniol	afterdark	I tried installing with jockey and aptitude
2010-05-25T06:38:00.000Z	afterdark	guiniol	did you try doing it though administration->hardware drivers
2010-05-25T06:39:00.000Z	guiniol	afterdark	that is the first thing i did
2010-05-25T06:39:00.000Z	afterdark	guiniol	strange, thats what did it for me, are you not saving the nvidia created xorg.conf file?
2010-05-25T06:39:00.000Z	guiniol	afterdark	it took me a while to figure out that i just needed to start gdm
2010-05-25T06:40:00.000Z	guiniol	afterdark	i tried with the old xorg.conf (9.10) and the one generated from nvidia-xconfig
2010-05-25T06:41:00.000Z	guiniol	afterdark	it only works on the first boot, that is what I find really strange
2010-05-25T06:42:00.000Z	afterdark	guiniol	so it works once, then reverts... what is showing up in the log file?
2010-05-25T06:42:00.000Z	afterdark	guiniol	when you get the low graphics mode error?
2010-05-25T06:44:00.000Z	guiniol	afterdark	Failed to initialize kernel module
2010-05-25T06:44:00.000Z	guiniol	afterdark	but the module is properly loaded and if I restart x maually (switch to console and type 'sudo start gdm') it works
2010-05-25T06:45:00.000Z	guiniol	afterdark	that's all I need to do
