2010-09-26T14:58:00.000Z	Sterist		can someone explain the purpose that the "root-system" package serves?
2010-09-26T15:00:00.000Z	rww	Sterist	Have you read the long description? (available at http://packages.ubuntu.com/lucid/root-system )
2010-09-26T15:01:00.000Z	Sterist	rww	yes but i'm not sure exactly what it would be used for
2010-09-26T15:02:00.000Z	Sterist	rww	does it optimize file management or something?
2010-09-26T15:02:00.000Z	rww	Sterist	no, it's a scientific library for dealing with large datasets for experiments or whatever
2010-09-26T15:04:00.000Z	Sterist	rww	i accidently left the room, missed your response if any
2010-09-26T15:04:00.000Z	rww	Sterist	no, it's a scientific library for dealing with large datasets for experiments or whatever
2010-09-30T10:15:00.000Z	rww	Sterist	It's still not as stable as I'd like. I don't plan on using it for a while.
2010-09-30T10:19:00.000Z	rww	Sterist	They get moved off the mirrors to http://old-releases.ubuntu.com
2010-09-30T10:20:00.000Z	Sterist	rww	ooh i searched like hell for that answer a while ago lol
2010-09-30T10:20:00.000Z	Sterist	rww	so would you have to manually add that URL to software sources?
2010-09-30T10:21:00.000Z	rww	Sterist	Preferably, you'd follow the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EOLUpgrades and move to something supported.
2010-09-30T10:22:00.000Z	Sterist	rww	my ps3 is running ubuntu 9.10 and it doesnt seem to like 10.04, so it's going to EOL ;)
2010-09-30T10:23:00.000Z	Sterist	rww	update manager fails and restores to previous state, and CD installer hangs at random points or randomly wont start
2010-09-30T10:23:00.000Z	Sterist	rww	with my laptop though, its no problemo :)
2010-09-30T10:54:00.000Z	rww	Sterist	Watch your language, please.
2010-09-30T10:54:00.000Z	Sterist	rww	its true lol
2010-09-30T10:54:00.000Z	rww	Sterist	I don't care.
