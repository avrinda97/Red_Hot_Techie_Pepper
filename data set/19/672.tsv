2011-10-19T22:56:00.000Z	JusticeZero		I'd like some input on my upgrade path. A lot has been said about Unity, mostly involving hair being torn out. I'm using an early netbook so unity is out of the picture most likely, i'm actually interested in trying out E17.. which for some reason is not available for Lucid. I'm considering a fresh install of Kubuntu 11.10 and then changing desktop - would that be a good route or is there some other quirks I should be aware of?
2011-10-19T22:58:00.000Z	JusticeZero		Gnome was eating enough resources to irk me, I have XFCE in right now.
2011-10-19T22:59:00.000Z	JusticeZero		It is.. I'm having the usual "an update just came out" problems at the moment, and i'm considering some other tweaks.
2011-10-19T23:00:00.000Z	cajunmlle	JusticeZero	nothing says you have to update everytime an update comes out
2011-10-19T23:01:00.000Z	JusticeZero		I haven't been. I think I still have holdovers from 2008 in here.
2011-10-19T23:02:00.000Z	JusticeZero		Well, i've been wanting to try E, but there's no Lucid package for it.
2011-10-19T23:02:00.000Z	JusticeZero		Yeah.. It's a high risk high reward decision they made. We won't really see how it worked till the next LTR, I think.
2011-10-19T23:02:00.000Z	cajunmlle	JusticeZero	is your intallation you've got now stable and does everything you need>
2011-10-19T23:03:00.000Z	JusticeZero		It's stable, with minor annoyances.
2011-10-19T23:05:00.000Z	JusticeZero		My i8mpression of Unity was that they felt the need to compete with what Win and Apple were aiming at, not what was existing, and they had 2 years till the next LTR, so they jumped for it hoping that when 12.04LTS comes out, Unity will be stable and useful.
2011-10-19T23:06:00.000Z	cajunmlle		11.10 has a lot of people with broken driver setups
2011-10-19T23:07:00.000Z	JusticeZero	cajunmlle	As noted, mostly I wanted to test out E, to see if it fits my tastes better. But it doesn't work for Lucid.
2011-10-19T23:07:00.000Z	JusticeZero		I suppose I could just kick it up to Maverick..
2011-10-19T23:09:00.000Z	JusticeZero		Anyhow, I also need to set up my other laptop, and everything I hear about Unity has been bad. also when I ran it on that laptop it gave me a monitor flicker.
2011-10-19T23:12:00.000Z	cajunmlle	JusticeZero	I'm sure you'll have the chance to try Enlightenment at some point. I've used it, my impression were that the eye candy didn't really make it more useful, and maybe was distracting
2011-10-19T23:13:00.000Z	JusticeZero		ok. Anyhow my main issue is that I have 2 computers, one reportedly needs Oneiric to run (though straight Ubuntu caused an odd monitor behavior) and the other is a lightweight.
2011-10-19T23:16:00.000Z	JusticeZero		I get an impression that K is a bit less aggressive. I don't wanr to have to put Oneiric on my work laptop and then get stuck fighting with Unity glitches and immaturities.
2011-10-19T23:18:00.000Z	JusticeZero		Or should I just jump for Oneiric on the new computer and trust that they can get it sorted in the next week or two?
2011-10-19T23:19:00.000Z	cajunmlle	JusticeZero	I wouldn't necessarily trust for that to happen
