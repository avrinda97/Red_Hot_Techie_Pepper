2008-07-10T05:00:00.000Z	unop	sn9_	redundant use of cat :)
2008-07-10T05:00:00.000Z	sn9_	unop	no, it's necessary
2008-07-10T05:00:00.000Z	unop	sn9_	for what reason?
2008-07-10T05:00:00.000Z	sn9_	unop	because with a pipe, stdout is not a tty
2008-07-10T05:01:00.000Z	unop	sn9_	errm,  and is he not on an interactive shell?
2008-07-10T05:01:00.000Z	sn9_	unop	he is, so cat is needed to fake it out
2008-07-10T05:02:00.000Z	unop	sn9_	that really is silly then -- but anyway, it does the same thing
2008-07-10T05:02:00.000Z	sn9_	unop	no, it doesn't -- try it
2008-07-10T05:03:00.000Z	unop	sn9_	i use that command all the time
2008-07-10T05:03:00.000Z	sn9_	unop	try it both ways and see the diff
2008-07-10T05:03:00.000Z	unop	sn9_	and i don't usually need to put the globs in single-quotes either
2008-07-10T05:04:00.000Z	sn9_	unop	if you are in a dir where the globs match, you do
2008-07-10T05:04:00.000Z	unop	sn9_	which is why i said -- i _usually_ don't .. and i see no difference when piping to cat
2008-07-10T05:05:00.000Z	sn9_	unop	shrink your terminal window to normal size and try again
2008-07-10T05:05:00.000Z	unop	sn9_	and what should i expect to see ? the same as before ?
2008-07-10T05:06:00.000Z	sn9_	unop	nope
2008-07-10T05:06:00.000Z	unop	sn9_	well, i do see the same thing
2008-07-10T05:06:00.000Z	sn9_	unop	then you must have a very large screen and/or a very small font
2008-07-10T05:07:00.000Z	unop	sn9_	not really -- 1024x1024, Kochi Gothic @ 9x15
