2005-06-10T13:22:00.000Z	refuze2looze		is there a bash command that checks if a program is running?
2005-06-10T13:23:00.000Z	thoreauputic	refuze2looze	ps aux | grep programname
2005-06-10T13:23:00.000Z	thoreauputic	refuze2looze	or pgrep programname
2005-06-10T13:31:00.000Z	refuze2looze	thoreauputic	i was thinking more of a command that returns a boolean value (for a script)
2005-06-28T08:43:00.000Z	thoreauputic	refuze2looze	to see where a package's files are run dpkg -L <packagename>
2005-10-09T14:43:00.000Z	thoreauputic	refuze2looze	sudo umount -l /dev/cdrom
2005-10-09T14:44:00.000Z	refuze2looze	thoreauputic	ok but now how do i eject it?
2005-10-09T14:44:00.000Z	thoreauputic	refuze2looze	eject /dev/cdrom
2005-10-09T14:44:00.000Z	thoreauputic	refuze2looze	use sudo if that doesn't work
2005-10-09T14:45:00.000Z	refuze2looze	thoreauputic	it gets stuck
2005-10-09T14:46:00.000Z	thoreauputic	refuze2looze	define "stuck"
2005-10-09T14:46:00.000Z	refuze2looze	thoreauputic	sudo eject /dev/hdd and then nothing happens, acts like it's still runing the command
2005-10-09T14:47:00.000Z	thoreauputic	refuze2looze	it umounted successfully?
2005-10-09T14:47:00.000Z	thoreauputic	refuze2looze	any error messages?
2005-10-09T14:47:00.000Z	refuze2looze	thoreauputic	yes it unmounted
2005-10-09T14:48:00.000Z	thoreauputic	refuze2looze	and you are sure it is /dev/hdd ?
2005-10-09T14:48:00.000Z	thoreauputic	refuze2looze	ctrl+c and try again
2005-10-26T10:07:00.000Z	thoreauputic	refuze2looze	you can try a "lazy umount" -  umount -l /device/name
2005-10-26T10:08:00.000Z	thoreauputic	refuze2looze	do  lsof | grep /media/iPod to see what's tying it up
