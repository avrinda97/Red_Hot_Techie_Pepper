2011-10-09T00:16:00.000Z	Bularthip		Evening
2011-10-09T00:16:00.000Z	Bularthip		Well I'd need help
2011-10-09T00:17:00.000Z	Bularthip		Well I actually can't easilly tell it
2011-10-09T00:17:00.000Z	Bularthip		I can't do anything, I actually cant' see anything
2011-10-09T00:18:00.000Z	Bularthip		When I boot up my PC, I will login normally into Ubuntu, but I can't see that application panel on the left, I can't open terminal, I can't exit, resize or move this IRC window
2011-10-09T00:18:00.000Z	Bularthip		Yeah, I have
2011-10-09T00:19:00.000Z	Bularthip		Yeah
2011-10-09T00:19:00.000Z	Bularthip		I'm pretty new on ubuntu but actually I didn't do anything to cause it
2011-10-09T00:20:00.000Z	th0r	Bularthip	if you log out, and at the login screen Sessions menu choose 'ubuntu classic' then try to log back in
2011-10-09T00:23:00.000Z	th0r	Bularthip	can you use Alt-Ctl-F2 to switch to a tty?
2011-10-09T00:25:00.000Z	th0r	Bularthip	switch to another tty, then use 'sudo shutdown -r now' to force a reboot. That should put you at the login screen where you can switch to gnome (ubuntu classic). That will at least get you a working environment
2011-10-09T00:25:00.000Z	Bularthip	th0r	will do. We'll see if I can get back here :p
2011-10-09T00:28:00.000Z	Bularthip	th0r	nothing :o It rebooted, but nothing new happened
2011-10-09T00:28:00.000Z	th0r	Bularthip	did it take you to a login screen, or do you have it set up to login automatically
2011-10-09T00:30:00.000Z	th0r	Bularthip	there should be a Sessions menu
2011-10-09T00:34:00.000Z	th0r	Bularthip	then you just have a problem with unity. Was it working originally, before you installed ccsm?
2011-10-09T00:35:00.000Z	Bularthip	th0r	Yes, zero problems before I had installed ccsm and first reboot after
2011-10-09T00:36:00.000Z	th0r	Bularthip	it is just a config issue I suspect. Unfortunately I don't use unity, running debian now. But someone here should be able to help. When you describe the problem, tell them unity was running fine until you installed ccsm, and that you made no changes using ccsm, and the problem showed up after the install when you rebooted.
2011-10-09T00:37:00.000Z	th0r	Bularthip	and let them know gnome is running OK now...just a problem with unity
