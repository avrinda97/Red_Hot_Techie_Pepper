2007-09-25T14:29:00.000Z	secher		hey, do you guys know how i can "uninstall" a program after i have installed it.. (not through synaptic)
2007-09-25T14:30:00.000Z	hmhowie	secher	"sudo apt-get remove <name of program>"
2007-09-25T14:31:00.000Z	secher	hmhowie	the problem is that i cant run the program, i know its there, i watched it install but when i try to do what you just said it just says it couldnt find the package
2007-09-25T14:32:00.000Z	hmhowie	secher	might i ask which program it is?
2007-09-25T14:32:00.000Z	secher	hmhowie	vmware
2007-09-25T14:33:00.000Z	hmhowie	secher	and how did you install it?
2007-09-25T14:34:00.000Z	hmhowie	secher	try to locate a vmware binary. did the guide say where it would be installed to?
2007-09-25T14:37:00.000Z	secher	hmhowie	its in /vmware in my homefolder
2007-09-25T14:37:00.000Z	hmhowie	secher	just out of curiosity, why did you download vmware and not use a preconfigured virtualisation solution from the repositories?
2007-09-25T14:39:00.000Z	secher	hmhowie	becuase i found a guide on how to run XP in VMware server, and followed that. Im very new to linux..
2007-09-25T14:40:00.000Z	hmhowie	secher	just download the vmware version from the repositories. that will already be configured to work on your system. i myself am a big fan of qemu (another virtualisation software and also in the repositories)
2007-09-25T14:41:00.000Z	secher	hmhowie	yes i read up on the subject of virualization and decided to try out Xen instead, but i figured its not that smart to have VMware still partly installed.. Thats why i wanna get rid of it
2007-09-25T14:42:00.000Z	hmhowie	secher	i just worry what the installer did. i don't much trust third-party installers. if you install xen, there's a 99% chance that any problems you have with it won't have anything to do with vmware
2007-09-25T14:43:00.000Z	secher	hmhowie	it wasnt third party, it was the official release from VMware.. But ok then ill just ignore it, and try to run Xen instead..
2007-09-25T14:44:00.000Z	hmhowie	secher	maybe there's a vmware uninstall script in $HOME/vmware. it's certainly worth a look
2007-09-25T14:46:00.000Z	secher	hmhowie	lol how stupid of me not to check that right away.. there is an uninstall in the dir..
2007-09-25T14:49:00.000Z	secher	hmhowie	thanks for your help
2007-09-25T14:59:00.000Z	secher	hmhowie	what did you say you used for virtualization?
2007-09-25T15:00:00.000Z	secher	hmhowie	and will it be able to run xp in it?
