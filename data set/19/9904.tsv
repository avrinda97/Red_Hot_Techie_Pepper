2006-10-12T13:12:00.000Z	azureal		oh, i wonder if i use aptitude... and then aptitude remove...
2006-10-12T13:12:00.000Z	nickspoon	azureal	well, problem is, unless you have ubuntu-desktop or something similar, you won't get new packages - only updates of old ones.
2006-10-12T13:07:00.000Z	nickspoon	azureal	yep.
2006-10-12T13:08:00.000Z	nickspoon	azureal	you'd just edit your /etc/apt/sources.list, and change all instances of dapper to edgy.
2006-10-12T13:08:00.000Z	azureal	nickspoon	i don't quite have the setup yet, but i will soon (server install + fluxbox from source)
2006-10-12T13:09:00.000Z	azureal	nickspoon	so you're currently running fluxbox?
2006-10-12T13:09:00.000Z	nickspoon	azureal	no, but provided you're running Ubuntu, it doesn't matter which GUI you have.
2006-10-12T13:10:00.000Z	azureal	nickspoon	the thing is, i already attempted to follow those steps w/ my current ubuntu... WITHOUT ubuntu-desktop
2006-10-12T13:10:00.000Z	azureal	nickspoon	it eventually caused some graphical bugs, font errors, and apt errors
2006-10-12T13:11:00.000Z	azureal	nickspoon	but apt-get install ubuntu-desktop is a real pain... _just_ to get update manager to work
2006-10-12T13:15:00.000Z	azureal	nickspoon	fluxbuntu is only in its developmental phase and buggy
2006-10-12T13:15:00.000Z	azureal	nickspoon	plus, it doesnt even say which version is installed..
2006-10-12T13:16:00.000Z	nickspoon	azureal	so, you're running ubuntu without ubuntu-desktop or anything of the sort...
2006-10-12T13:17:00.000Z	azureal	nickspoon	ah yea.. and it was stable until i attempted to upgrade to edgy
2006-10-12T13:17:00.000Z	azureal	nickspoon	i just had the regular gnomish install + fluxbox, and then i pretty much removed everything gnome-related with debfoster
2006-10-12T13:18:00.000Z	nickspoon	azureal	in order to upgrade, you'll have to reinstall ubuntu-desktop (or kubuntu or xubuntu-desktop), then get rid of it afterwards.
2006-10-12T13:19:00.000Z	azureal	nickspoon	nod, so the best way would be through aptitude, not apt, correct?
2006-10-12T13:21:00.000Z	azureal	nickspoon	ah, on second thought i'm not sure if i want to go through a server install...i mean which program will it use for partitioning =/
2006-10-12T13:22:00.000Z	azureal	nickspoon	or is it at least semi-graphical
