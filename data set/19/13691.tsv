2005-09-20T09:34:00.000Z	apokryphos	cute_bettong	what exactly are you having a problem with?
2005-09-20T09:35:00.000Z	apokryphos	cute_bettong	so what's the problem?
2005-09-20T09:38:00.000Z	apokryphos	cute_bettong	no Multiverse there
2005-09-20T09:39:00.000Z	apokryphos	cute_bettong	multiverse is a repository; you don't install it, you add it.
2005-09-20T09:39:00.000Z	apokryphos	cute_bettong	check the link ubotu gave you
2005-10-05T15:59:00.000Z	apokryphos	cute_bettong	you can use Hoary forever and ever
2005-10-05T15:59:00.000Z	apokryphos	cute_bettong	supported for 18 months
2005-10-06T16:00:00.000Z	apokryphos	cute_bettong	of course; it is in fact recommended that you do that
2005-10-06T16:00:00.000Z	apokryphos	cute_bettong	breezy hasn't reached stable status yet
