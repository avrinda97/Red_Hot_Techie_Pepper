2012-02-06T10:14:00.000Z	thetinyjesus		are you guys getting used to unity yet?
2012-02-06T10:15:00.000Z	thetinyjesus		just a few days for me, im starting to like it
2012-02-06T10:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	thetinyjesus	its fine here
2012-02-06T10:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	thetinyjesus	if you backup the hidden files in your home folder you can restore them
2012-02-06T10:22:00.000Z	thetinyjesus	ActionParsnip	the ones that are usually like .weechat etc in the usr/lib ?
2012-02-06T10:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	thetinyjesus	that sort of thing, yes
2012-02-06T10:24:00.000Z	thetinyjesus	ActionParsnip	do you know a website that will let me know exactly which directories need to be backed up?
2012-02-06T10:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	thetinyjesus	depends what apps you want the config backing up of. I'd just backup the entirety of your home folder
2012-02-08T05:18:00.000Z	thetinyjesus	ActionParsnip	the problem is apple doesn't just say put the artist in a folder like you would think, the folder name along with song title are all coded in numbers
2012-02-08T05:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	thetinyjesus	afaik rhythmnbox does something magical, I believe amarok can manage them too
2012-02-08T05:19:00.000Z	thetinyjesus	ActionParsnip	 i can view EVERYTHING on my iphone but have no friggin clue what the song is, and yes i can transfer the songs INTO rhythmnbox but i cannot transfer back onto the iphone
2012-02-08T05:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	thetinyjesus	could always run Windows in the closed source virtualbox. If companies don't support Linux I suggest you don't buy their kit
2012-02-08T05:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	thetinyjesus	Kodak also refuse to support Linux
2012-02-08T05:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	thetinyjesus	as do Logitech
2012-02-08T05:21:00.000Z	thetinyjesus	ActionParsnip	kodak sucks and is about to go under cant see why they wouold
2012-02-08T05:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	thetinyjesus	its an example
2012-02-08T05:22:00.000Z	thetinyjesus	ActionParsnip	i know but a bad decision haha, btw i never ran virtual box does it work off an existing windows install or is it like booting into a live cd
2012-02-15T21:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	thetinyjesus	depends on config
