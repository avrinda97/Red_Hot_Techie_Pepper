2008-09-10T16:00:00.000Z	outbackwifi		i wouldnt need to automount it always at the same mount point would i?
2008-09-10T16:02:00.000Z	lmg	outbackwifi	mine gets mounted to /media/EXTERNAL no matter where I plug it in.
2008-09-10T15:56:00.000Z	lmg	outbackwifi	nope.
2008-09-10T15:58:00.000Z	outbackwifi	lmg	i find out the blkid and then use that to make an entry into fstab
2008-09-10T15:58:00.000Z	lmg	outbackwifi	what if you boot with an external drive connected?
2008-09-10T15:59:00.000Z	outbackwifi	lmg	even then
2008-09-10T15:59:00.000Z	lmg	outbackwifi	it will show up in "places" but not be automounted
2008-09-10T15:59:00.000Z	outbackwifi	lmg	i use an external hdd
2008-09-10T15:59:00.000Z	lmg	outbackwifi	what if you used mine? without having used it before? :)
2008-09-10T16:00:00.000Z	lmg	outbackwifi	but you could
2008-09-10T16:00:00.000Z	outbackwifi	lmg	i dont get the point
2008-09-10T16:01:00.000Z	lmg	outbackwifi	point is.. the places menu autodetects drives (internal + external) just fine. so why bother with mountpoints?
2008-09-10T16:01:00.000Z	lmg	outbackwifi	if you can just set a flag and have everything automounted according to its label.
2008-09-10T16:01:00.000Z	outbackwifi	lmg	if i want my external drive to get mounted always on mount point /media/Backup irrespective of which usb port i plugged it in
2008-09-10T16:02:00.000Z	lmg	outbackwifi	but I never bothered with mountpoints or USB ids. just that one flag
2008-09-10T16:03:00.000Z	outbackwifi	lmg	i am not facing the issue here
2008-09-10T16:03:00.000Z	outbackwifi	lmg	please guide the OP
