2004-11-10T11:36:00.000Z	ThreeDayMonk		manuals are sparse, and often badly written
2004-11-10T11:37:00.000Z	ThreeDayMonk		the skills learned in getting linux to do something are not inherently useful or transferable skills
2004-11-10T11:37:00.000Z	SuperLag	ThreeDayMonk	I beg to differ.
2004-11-10T11:38:00.000Z	ThreeDayMonk	SuperLag	well, is editing XF86Config by hand really useful?
2004-11-10T11:39:00.000Z	SuperLag	ThreeDayMonk	yes, it is.  It forces you to get to know your system, your hardware... and how to troubleshoot.
2004-11-10T11:39:00.000Z	SuperLag	ThreeDayMonk	among other things
2004-11-10T11:39:00.000Z	SuperLag	ThreeDayMonk	if you don't want to edit a text file, you need to stop using Linux now.  Seriously.
2004-11-10T11:40:00.000Z	ThreeDayMonk	SuperLag	I'm not talking about me
2004-11-10T11:40:00.000Z	SuperLag	ThreeDayMonk	what kind of video card?
2004-11-10T11:40:00.000Z	SuperLag	ThreeDayMonk	Matrox Parhelis? :)
2004-11-10T11:41:00.000Z	ThreeDayMonk	SuperLag	one PCI ATI and one dual-head nVidia
2004-11-10T11:42:00.000Z	SuperLag	ThreeDayMonk	it's not leet posturing.  It's FACT.  _EVERYTHING_ in Linux is a file.  That is NOT going to change.  The ability to edit a text file is not good or bad.  It's ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY.  And the ability to do so does not make you any better or worse than anyone else.  It just makes you a Linux user.
2004-11-10T11:43:00.000Z	ThreeDayMonk	SuperLag	I just feel that it should be the only way of doing so many things
2004-11-10T11:43:00.000Z	SuperLag	ThreeDayMonk	there's an answer for that.  A resolution.  It's called "use a different OS"
2004-11-10T11:44:00.000Z	ThreeDayMonk	SuperLag	why?  everyone should use windows if they aren't cool enough for linux?
2004-11-10T11:44:00.000Z	SuperLag	ThreeDayMonk	no it's not
2004-11-10T11:44:00.000Z	SuperLag	ThreeDayMonk	who said anything about cool?
2004-11-10T11:54:00.000Z	ThreeDayMonk	SuperLag	why shouldn't there by a graphical tool to configure grub?
2004-11-10T11:55:00.000Z	SuperLag	ThreeDayMonk	if you know of such a tool, speak up.
