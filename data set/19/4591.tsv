2009-04-02T02:38:00.000Z	Matson		do apt-get and dpkg work on ubuntu?
2009-04-02T02:38:00.000Z	Matson		similar to the same commands on debian?
2009-04-02T02:39:00.000Z	Matson		http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=103462 from 2005  says that yes - they do.   wondering if that is still accurate, specifically in 8.04 LTS
2009-04-02T02:41:00.000Z	Matson		I'm looking at installing ubuntu for te first time
2009-04-02T02:42:00.000Z	Matson		http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/download shows 8.04 and 8.10
2009-04-02T02:42:00.000Z	Matson		what factors go into chosing which one to use?
2009-04-02T02:44:00.000Z	Matson		what is teh difference between 8.04 and 8.10?
2009-04-02T02:44:00.000Z	Matson		it is as simple as a dist-upgrade to go from 8.04 to 8.10?
2009-04-02T02:45:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Matson	not much,  except completly different versions of  Xorg
2009-04-02T02:46:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Matson	 April 23rd  9.04  and it won't be LTS
2009-04-02T02:49:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Matson	yes, but  for various reasons    not  the best idea
2009-04-02T02:53:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Matson	18 months
2009-04-02T02:54:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Matson	standard releases such as  8.10 and 9.04 get 18 months of suppourt, where as long term suppourt releasese such as 8.04  get  3 years suppourt on the desktop and 5 on the server
2009-04-02T02:55:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Matson	and  so LTS's  aren't really considered a downgrade even,  plus slightly more cutting edge stuff with be in the versions before the next LTS
2009-04-02T02:55:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Matson	no they will use the same stuff
2009-04-02T02:55:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Matson	you can get the server stuff in the desktop version
2009-04-08T02:55:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Matson	no maxium partition size,  as long as you got space on your hard disk
2009-04-08T02:55:00.000Z	Matson	sebsebseb	thanks
2009-04-11T03:25:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Matson	no problem, and  that was a good guess, didn't know that one existed
