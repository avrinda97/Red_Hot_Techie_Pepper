2010-04-19T02:39:00.000Z	TomG	rapha	Sorry to ask but what are you trying to do?
2010-04-19T02:40:00.000Z	rapha	TomG	my brother doesnt want his ipod anymore so he gave it to me and now i'm trying to delete all the songs on it and then put my own there. the strange thing is, i was able to copy the songs to my harddisk and listen to them, but the ipod claims there's no music on it.
2010-04-19T02:41:00.000Z	TomG	rapha	I suggest you simply bite the bullet and load up itunes on a mac of windows OS then reload the IPOD on that
2010-04-19T02:41:00.000Z	TomG	rapha	After that, then move back to linux and start fresh
2010-04-19T02:42:00.000Z	rapha	TomG	might be a good idea ... i got a VirtualBox windows machine sitting somewhere ... will i need some sort of apple account or something?
2010-04-19T02:42:00.000Z	TomG	rapha	No, you can just download it from whereever itunes is.
2010-04-19T02:42:00.000Z	rapha	TomG	okay, sounds like maybe the best solution
2010-04-19T02:43:00.000Z	TomG	rapha	That is personally what I do with my sister's IPOD when problems occur
2010-04-19T02:43:00.000Z	rapha	TomG	that's funny, everybody seems to have siblings with iPods, but none of their own :)
2010-04-19T02:43:00.000Z	TomG	rapha	I would never buy one myself
2010-04-19T02:44:00.000Z	TomG	rapha	Proprietary junk like IPODs just frustrate me
2010-04-19T02:45:00.000Z	rapha	TomG	yeah, same for me ... but since it was for free i thought i would give it a try, see what the experience was like under Ubuntu, if it was usable and all
2010-04-19T02:45:00.000Z	TomG	rapha	I can say it is very much usable, with patience of course
2010-04-19T02:45:00.000Z	rapha	TomG	patience like loading up itunes on windows and reinitializing it? =)
2010-04-19T02:45:00.000Z	TomG	rapha	You may also want to try doing it under Amarok, I hear lots of praise from people who use it on that.
2010-04-19T02:46:00.000Z	rapha	TomG	if even an rm -rf on the console doesnt work, i doubt amarok has a trick to counter that
2010-04-19T02:47:00.000Z	TomG	rapha	Well if you did that on an IPOD, it'd just wipe it out and you'd be left with a flash drive
2010-04-19T02:47:00.000Z	rapha	TomG	doesnt work anyway - "read-only filesystem" (despite mount showing it as rw)
2010-04-19T03:44:00.000Z	TomG	rapha	Correct.
