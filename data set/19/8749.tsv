2007-10-28T08:41:00.000Z	Fyda	gavintlgold	as long as file permissions are preserved...
2007-10-28T08:41:00.000Z	Fyda	gavintlgold	Hi :) Yeah, I remember backing up my Ubuntu files to a CD-RW, which became problematic because the file perms didn't survive
2007-10-28T08:42:00.000Z	Fyda	gavintlgold	I had to manually re-set those perms -- when I tried logging in, I didn't have permissions for my own stuff in ~, so it threw an error :(
2007-10-28T08:43:00.000Z	Fyda	gavintlgold	I'm thinking maybe if the external drive were ext3?
2007-10-28T08:43:00.000Z	Fyda	gavintlgold	Or some partition on it, anyway
2007-10-28T08:43:00.000Z	gavintlgold	Fyda	 no, it's fat32 :( i had trouble formatting it to ext3
2007-10-28T08:44:00.000Z	Fyda	gavintlgold	well, I tried temporarily moving /usr/local to an fat32 partition, and when I moved it back, the lack of perms made it impossible to execute anything under the bin directory
2007-10-28T08:44:00.000Z	gavintlgold	Fyda	i see, that's not what i'm attempting
2007-10-28T08:45:00.000Z	Fyda	gavintlgold	Ah, okay
2007-10-28T08:45:00.000Z	gavintlgold	Fyda	i'm going to reinstall stuff... might as well
2007-10-28T08:47:00.000Z	Fyda	gavintlgold	Heh, yeah, I upgraded the laptop to Gutsy in a slow and laborious way
2007-10-28T08:47:00.000Z	Fyda	gavintlgold	Instead of using the automatic upgrader, I just did it completely manually by editing the sources.list and progressively upgrading
2007-10-28T08:48:00.000Z	Fyda	gavintlgold	I would not recommend it to anyone else, but at least it didn't break my laptop. Which is more than I can say for the official upgrader on my desktop :(
2007-10-28T08:49:00.000Z	Fyda	gavintlgold	Yeah, I don't understand it. Fresh installations are beautiful, but the upgrades seem to always mess something up.
2007-10-28T08:49:00.000Z	Fyda	gavintlgold	From Dapper to Edgy, from Edgy to Feisty, I've had problems each time
2007-10-28T08:49:00.000Z	gavintlgold	Fyda	it's because it's never completely sure what's up with your computer
2007-10-28T08:50:00.000Z	gavintlgold	Fyda	i'm sure if you had a computer running the completely default install of feisty, the upgrade would be fine
2007-10-28T08:50:00.000Z	Fyda	gavintlgold	Well, to be fair, I did use 3rd-party repos.
2007-10-28T08:51:00.000Z	Fyda	gavintlgold	Yeah, but maybe because people are in bed?
