2010-10-06T18:12:00.000Z	phil_in_london		does virtualbox allow you to run any architechture as well as different os's ?
2010-10-06T18:12:00.000Z	ganeshran	phil_in_london	yes it is compatible with all
2010-10-06T18:13:00.000Z	phil_in_london	ganeshran	thanks, that does make it interesting. One other thing, if you know, would I be able to compile with gcc/c++ inside virtualbox. The idea is to have a piece of software compiled for that architechture rather than the sometimes messy business of cross-compiling.
2010-10-06T18:14:00.000Z	ganeshran	phil_in_london	you should be pretty much able to do anything that you do on a physical box
2010-10-06T18:14:00.000Z	ganeshran	phil_in_london	Only challenge in virtual box is confgiuring network which is needed sometimes
2010-10-06T18:14:00.000Z	phil_in_london	ganeshran	plovs, thanks very much, my life just got easier
2010-10-06T18:15:00.000Z	phil_in_london	ganeshran	all the config including network is done after the image is compiled, so thats not a problem.
2010-10-06T18:15:00.000Z	ganeshran	phil_in_london	No sometimes if you have to interact with host computer ports you need to forward them
2010-10-06T18:16:00.000Z	ganeshran	phil_in_london	especially for applications which require specific ports to run. Like VNC
2010-10-06T18:16:00.000Z	phil_in_london	ganeshran	I don't actually intend to run the compiled software within virtualbox. I only want it as an "enviroment" to create the binaries for specific arch's, specifically mips
2010-10-06T18:17:00.000Z	ganeshran	phil_in_london	: what all architectures are you looking for
2010-10-06T18:18:00.000Z	ganeshran	phil_in_london	Ok because I am not sure if non x-86 gues os will run
2010-10-06T18:19:00.000Z	phil_in_london	ganeshran	well, it certainly looks like investigating, I'll report back what I find out. Do you know if you are able to limit the amount of memory available to the os running inside virtualbox? For example, I would want to limit it to 8mb, that mirrors the enviroment the software runs in.
2010-10-06T18:20:00.000Z	ganeshran	phil_in_london	Yes while creating the VM you can limit the RAM available to it
2010-10-06T18:20:00.000Z	phil_in_london	ganeshran	excellent, thanks for all the help, I'd be excited and get on it right now if not for the hangover :-o
2010-10-06T18:21:00.000Z	ganeshran	phil_in_london	Check this link http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Guest_OSes
2010-10-06T18:22:00.000Z	ganeshran	phil_in_london	Most of them are x86 and x64 based. I am not sure if running a powerPC or other architectures would be supported. Maybe someone else can help
2010-10-06T18:22:00.000Z	phil_in_london	ganeshran	yeah, I've been asking about it for awhile, as soon as I say "mips" the answers/information dries up :)
2010-10-06T18:23:00.000Z	ganeshran	phil_in_london	:) Try looking for other IRC channels for them
