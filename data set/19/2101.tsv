2011-01-13T10:20:00.000Z	slgma		anyone have any experience troubleshooting VNC?
2011-01-13T10:22:00.000Z	sacarlson	slgma	vnc is cool problem connecting to a remote on internet?
2011-01-13T10:23:00.000Z	sacarlson	slgma	what is your problem with vnc?  connecting to who and where?
2011-01-13T10:26:00.000Z	sacarlson	slgma	did you try the ip address of the server instead of the auto find?
2011-01-13T10:27:00.000Z	sacarlson	slgma	oh I didn't know you could connect to yourself with vnc,  can you ping the remote?
2011-01-13T10:31:00.000Z	sacarlson	slgma	what is seen with ps -A | grep vino
2011-01-13T10:33:00.000Z	sacarlson	slgma	you should also see vino-server,  try togle  allow other users off then on again see if vino-server apears
2011-01-13T10:34:00.000Z	slgma	sacarlson	on an interesting side note, if i enable Always display icon at the bottom
2011-01-13T10:39:00.000Z	sacarlson	slgma	try run vino-preferences in a terminal?
2011-01-13T10:41:00.000Z	sacarlson	slgma	loaded does that mean it works?
2011-01-13T10:41:00.000Z	slgma	sacarlson	yea it loads from the menu or terminal fine
2011-01-13T10:41:00.000Z	sacarlson	slgma	togle it off and on see what error come out on the terminal it's running in
2011-01-13T10:42:00.000Z	slgma	sacarlson	i toggled every option and it doesnt give any errors
2011-01-13T10:42:00.000Z	slgma	sacarlson	the notification area option in vino-preferences to always display an icon doesnt work
2011-01-13T10:42:00.000Z	sacarlson	slgma	ok and ps -A| grep vino-server  still nothing?
2011-01-13T10:44:00.000Z	sacarlson	slgma	no that's not a problem I can't seem to find the program the vino-preference runs eather,  but it works for me
2011-01-13T10:48:00.000Z	sacarlson	slgma	I found the server at /usr/lib/vino/vino-server  try run that
2011-01-13T10:49:00.000Z	sacarlson	slgma	I'm not sure why the preference did run it then
2011-01-13T10:50:00.000Z	sacarlson	slgma	it seems I see the vino-server running even if it's disabled so it must start at boot at some point, maybe it's not starting there for you
