2007-05-28T11:48:00.000Z	KevinOoO		hey yeall, last night i started the software update in the task tray, it downloaded the newest headers i think, well when i rebooted xserver crashed. I am also usind the nvidia drivers from their website
2007-05-28T11:48:00.000Z	Slart	KevinOoO	you probably got a new kernel.. you'll have to install the nvidia drivers again
2007-05-28T11:49:00.000Z	Slart	KevinOoO	you don't have to mess with the xorg.conf file.. just run that nvidia file ... "sudo sh NVIDIAblabla.sh"
2007-05-28T11:50:00.000Z	Slart	KevinOoO	it's still there, at nvidias site... same place...you need an url?
2007-05-28T11:50:00.000Z	Slart	KevinOoO	you can use wget  "sudo apt-get install wget"
2007-05-28T11:50:00.000Z	Slart	KevinOoO	32bit or 64bit?
2007-05-28T11:52:00.000Z	Slart	KevinOoO	here's the url: http://us.download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86/1.0-9755/NVIDIA-Linux-x86-1.0-9755-pkg1.run
2007-05-28T11:52:00.000Z	Slart	KevinOoO	with wget you run this "wget http://us.download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86/1.0-9755/NVIDIA-Linux-x86-1.0-9755-pkg1.run"
2007-05-28T11:52:00.000Z	KevinOoO	Slart	thanks, where will it put it then?
2007-05-28T11:53:00.000Z	Slart	KevinOoO	it will download to your current directory.. usually your home dir
2007-05-28T11:53:00.000Z	Slart	KevinOoO	that's an ok place for it to be
2007-05-28T11:54:00.000Z	Slart	KevinOoO	at the moment they are the same, I think
2007-05-28T12:15:00.000Z	KevinOoO	Slart	i triet that wget command and it said it could not resolve the host i think the url is right i just dont think my internet connection was working
2007-05-28T12:16:00.000Z	Slart	KevinOoO	hmm.. the urls was right, yes.. something else might be wrong
2007-05-28T12:18:00.000Z	Slart	KevinOoO	can you ping www.nvidia.com or some similar address?
2007-05-28T12:19:00.000Z	Slart	KevinOoO	but you had network connection before the kernel upgrade.. right?
2007-05-28T12:20:00.000Z	Slart	KevinOoO	do you use a wireless connection? something else that only runs under gnome?
2007-05-28T12:20:00.000Z	Slart	KevinOoO	what does ifconfig tell you?
2007-05-28T12:22:00.000Z	Slart	KevinOoO	and the ip is correct? can you ping something else? www.sunet.se? some other known address that is close to you?
