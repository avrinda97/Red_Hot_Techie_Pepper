2007-02-13T09:51:00.000Z	Asc__		wimpog: You don't see any messages when ubuntu is loading?
2007-02-13T09:52:00.000Z	Wimpog	Asc__	Yeah, I only see like 2 or 3 - checking the file system and activating swap
2007-02-13T09:52:00.000Z	Wimpog	Asc__	but it should say things like starting DHCP, starting DNS, starting Mysql
2007-02-13T09:53:00.000Z	Wimpog	Asc__	how do I activate it?
2007-02-13T09:53:00.000Z	Wimpog	Asc__	I'd like to know
2007-02-13T09:53:00.000Z	Wimpog	Asc__	do you have inittab file in your system?
2007-02-13T09:54:00.000Z	Wimpog	Asc__	because I don't have it for some reason
2007-02-13T09:55:00.000Z	Wimpog	Asc__	type: more /etc/inittab This file specifies how your system should boot. I think maybe this is a problem why we're not getting messages
2007-02-13T09:55:00.000Z	Wimpog	Asc__	let me know if you have that file
2007-02-13T09:58:00.000Z	Wimpog	Asc__	for splash screen it says "ro quite splash" what do I change here?
2007-02-13T09:59:00.000Z	Wimpog	Asc__	no
2007-02-13T10:00:00.000Z	Wimpog	Asc__	blank for a long time and then some text like activating swap, filesystem, only 3 messages
2007-02-13T10:01:00.000Z	Asc__	Wimpog	Different than mine.  Do you want a graphical splash?
2007-02-13T10:02:00.000Z	Asc__	Wimpog	Okay.  Removing 'splash' will make it text-mode.  n2diy says that removing 'quiet' will also do something,
2007-02-13T10:02:00.000Z	Wimpog	Asc__	I'll try now
2007-02-13T10:02:00.000Z	Asc__	Wimpog	I've not tried without quiet, but it seems like it ought to make it print more messages.
2007-02-13T10:03:00.000Z	Wimpog	Asc__	The fact that I don't have /etc/inittab file means already something is wrong
2007-02-13T10:04:00.000Z	Wimpog	Asc__	yeah, I do have that
2007-02-13T10:06:00.000Z	Wimpog	Asc__	Did you install Edgy or upgraded from hoary?
