2005-04-15T08:01:00.000Z	chillywilly		why does nautilus now behave like I am clicking everything with the middle mouse button and closing the parent window?
2005-04-15T08:02:00.000Z	chillywilly		it's not as "spatial" as it used to be ;)
2005-04-15T08:02:00.000Z	chillywilly		yea but I want the old be havior
2005-04-15T08:02:00.000Z	chillywilly		why did they change the behavior?
2005-04-15T08:03:00.000Z	lunitik	chillywilly	cuz the guy paying for Ubuntu development likes it that way...
2005-04-15T08:10:00.000Z	lunitik	chillywilly	it is not gnomes fault this time though...
2005-04-15T08:10:00.000Z	chillywilly	lunitik	who's fault is it then?
2005-04-15T08:10:00.000Z	lunitik	chillywilly	besides... just go to Applications > System Tools > File Browser and you get the old look (single window navigation..)
2005-04-15T08:10:00.000Z	lunitik	chillywilly	I already told you, this time, its Mark Shuttleworth's fault.
2005-04-15T08:11:00.000Z	lunitik	chillywilly	ie, its not changed at all in mainstream gnome...
2005-04-15T08:12:00.000Z	lunitik	chillywilly	all they did is change the gconf setting though... not hard to change back.
2005-04-15T08:12:00.000Z	chillywilly	lunitik	well I figured that but I don't know what key it is
2005-04-15T08:13:00.000Z	lunitik	chillywilly	see what seb128 just said... that bug also notes how to change it back...
2005-04-15T08:34:00.000Z	lunitik	chillywilly	if you read his side... it really does make sense... although I think they should have just changed the button order (left to close parent go to child, middle for just opening parent)
2005-04-15T08:35:00.000Z	lunitik	chillywilly	then you can't have used it that much... I've had (I counted, just cuz it was a mess) 26 windows open at one time... I certainly didn't need them all...
2005-04-15T08:36:00.000Z	lunitik	chillywilly	imo... most common usage should be the left click action...
2005-04-15T08:37:00.000Z	lunitik	chillywilly	most common usage for most is to browse... not to copy files...
2005-04-15T08:38:00.000Z	chillywilly	lunitik	well I prefer to use a gui to reraange or clean up my files not necessarily to browse to a given document...for those purposes I usually havs links on my desktop
2005-04-15T08:39:00.000Z	lunitik	chillywilly	still... you won't need 20+ windows... maybe up to like 4 or so depending on how much rearranging  :/
