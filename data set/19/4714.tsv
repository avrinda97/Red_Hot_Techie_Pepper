2008-11-25T13:08:00.000Z	jeancalvin		can someone pls help me with port issue in Transmission?
2008-11-25T13:08:00.000Z	LurkersA	jeancalvin	Is port 1 a reserved port? It is used for TCPMUX so maybe you can't open it.
2008-11-25T13:09:00.000Z	LurkersA	jeancalvin	try using a port that isn't used for anything else, there is a list here http://www.iana.org/assignments/port-numbers
2008-11-25T13:10:00.000Z	jeancalvin	LurkersA	thank you for your reply. I'm not sure if port 1 is a reserved port. Also, I added more "incoming ports"
2008-11-25T13:10:00.000Z	LurkersA	jeancalvin	Yes, That was you can be assured of no clashes
2008-11-25T13:11:00.000Z	LurkersA	jeancalvin	Unassigned is probably a better bet
2008-11-25T13:42:00.000Z	jeancalvin	LurkersA	magnetron: pls see above
2008-11-25T13:44:00.000Z	LurkersA	jeancalvin	Hmmmm Interesting. Does it do that with any other ports?
2008-11-25T13:44:00.000Z	jeancalvin	LurkersA	yes
2008-11-25T13:44:00.000Z	jeancalvin	LurkersA	i can't delete other custom entries in dell router's page.
2008-11-25T13:45:00.000Z	LurkersA	jeancalvin	That is..... odd
2008-11-25T13:45:00.000Z	LurkersA	jeancalvin	Are there any fields on the page that are not filled in?
2008-11-25T13:47:00.000Z	LurkersA	jeancalvin	Hmmmmmmm
2008-11-25T13:47:00.000Z	jeancalvin	LurkersA	is there some other way i can edit my dell router settings?
2008-11-25T13:47:00.000Z	LurkersA	jeancalvin	I am not sure sorry -shrug-
2008-11-25T13:47:00.000Z	LurkersA	jeancalvin	Try googling the router model number to get some documents
