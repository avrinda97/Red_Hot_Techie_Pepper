2012-02-19T09:43:00.000Z	blud		how do i access it? (I think i know how and its not there, but yeah)
2012-02-19T09:44:00.000Z	urfr332gO	blud	crtl-alt-t
2012-02-19T09:45:00.000Z	urfr332gO	blud	bad burn maybe it should be in the dash.
2012-02-27T03:15:00.000Z	urfr332gO	blud	can you try try the recovery kernel?
2012-02-27T03:15:00.000Z	blud	urfr332gO	maybe, how do i do that?
2012-02-27T03:16:00.000Z	urfr332gO	blud	in the grub menu which you may need to get to with holding down the shift at powering on are kernel sets the second one of each is the recovery.
2012-02-27T03:19:00.000Z	blud	urfr332gO	can i do that "Rescue a broken system" with Lubuntu 11.10 too? Cuz I'm using ubuntu not lubuntu (but i would be on here for many hours before getting any help on the lubuntu channel)
2012-02-27T03:19:00.000Z	blud	urfr332gO	er, typo, Im using Lubuntu, not ubuntu
2012-02-27T03:20:00.000Z	urfr332gO	blud	lubuntu and ubuntu are only differnt by the desktop, using the recovery to get in is the same.
2012-02-27T03:20:00.000Z	blud	urfr332gO	oh so when I do "rescue a broken system" that isn't going to fix anything, it will jsut get me into a command prompt or something so that I can fix things right?
2012-02-27T03:21:00.000Z	urfr332gO	blud	several option even getting to logged in to fix it from the desktop.
2012-02-27T03:22:00.000Z	blud	urfr332gO	the only thing is, i have no idea whats wrong with it, so once i get in, i dont know what to do? Any tips on that?
2012-02-27T03:22:00.000Z	urfr332gO	blud	I have only used recovery sparsely, it is abit different depending on the release you running but all get you to a desktop if you can get there.
2012-02-27T03:23:00.000Z	blud	urfr332gO	yeah but I mean, once i get there, what am i supposed to do to fix my problem?
2012-02-27T03:24:00.000Z	urfr332gO	blud	sounds like I'm guessing here a interrupted update, get to the desktop if you can so you have a terminal then check with the channel really.
2012-02-27T03:24:00.000Z	blud	urfr332gO	ok cool
2012-02-27T03:25:00.000Z	urfr332gO	blud	having cli access will help others help you really, the real geeks not a poser like me. :)
