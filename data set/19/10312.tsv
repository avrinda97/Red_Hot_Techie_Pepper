2007-03-01T17:42:00.000Z	cberlo	kbrooks	My ultimate goal is this:  have one install of XP on a machine; use it to run a specific app to port over to an Edubuntu LTSP box.
2007-03-01T17:45:00.000Z	cberlo	kbrooks	I want to run notepad from windows and display that on Linux, just to clarify.
2007-03-01T17:46:00.000Z	cberlo	kbrooks	So far, I like the sound of that...
2007-03-01T17:47:00.000Z	cberlo	kbrooks	Tried that -- only allows one user at a time to connect, and I can't specify only one app.  They get the whole desktop or nothing on a default XP.
2007-03-01T17:47:00.000Z	kbrooks	cberlo	i will find the coherencxe post for u
2007-03-01T17:47:00.000Z	cberlo	kbrooks	Thanks!
2007-03-01T17:47:00.000Z	kbrooks	cberlo	u can adapt it...
2007-03-01T17:50:00.000Z	kbrooks	cberlo	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SeamlessVirtualization some substitutions though
2007-03-01T17:50:00.000Z	cberlo	kbrooks	Thanks!  Your lead may help me proliferate Linux to up to 3000 clients in my school board.
2007-03-01T17:51:00.000Z	kbrooks	cberlo	np, i do this for free :-)
2007-03-01T17:51:00.000Z	kbrooks	cberlo	replace 3389 with 80
2007-03-01T17:51:00.000Z	cberlo	kbrooks	Yeah, don't we all?  ;)
2007-03-01T17:51:00.000Z	kbrooks	cberlo	and install rdesktop
2007-03-01T17:52:00.000Z	kbrooks	cberlo	and allow users to login as admin
2007-03-01T17:52:00.000Z	cberlo	kbrooks	I'll look into it and see if I can make it work for my scenario.  Hopefully this will do the trick!  There's another promising project called MetaVNC I'm looking into as well.
2007-03-01T17:52:00.000Z	kbrooks	cberlo	link?
2007-03-01T17:53:00.000Z	kbrooks	cberlo	i haven't tried this out on myself. just a warning hehe
2007-03-01T17:54:00.000Z	cberlo	kbrooks	I've tried seamlessrdp on a terminal server, but it wouldn't work right because I couldn't follow all the directions (didin't have auth to do so)
