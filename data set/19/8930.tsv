2008-08-05T02:38:00.000Z	sashimi		hello everybody
2008-08-05T02:39:00.000Z	sashimi		would someone be so kind as to tell me what options I have to specify in fstab to mount an EXT3 partition with a specific forced GID ?
2008-08-05T02:40:00.000Z	unop	sashimi	as far as i can tell,  ext3 does not have the UID/GID mount options -- you set permissions normally
2008-08-05T02:42:00.000Z	unop	sashimi	 can't you change the groups on the files?
2008-08-05T02:45:00.000Z	unop	sashimi	change the groups with chown/chgrp and then set chmod g+s  .. i don't see the problem with this :)
2008-08-05T02:52:00.000Z	unop	sashimi	to the directories you want this behaviour propagated too
2008-08-05T02:54:00.000Z	unop	sashimi	you can set it to the mount point too if you want .. if you use chmod in this way.  chmod g+s /path/to/mount_point # existing permissions should stay intact, only the setgid bit is set
2008-08-05T02:58:00.000Z	unop	sashimi	yes?
2008-08-05T03:03:00.000Z	unop	sashimi	can you repeat the steps -- but use an ls -ld /mnt/share  after each .. and then put what you have there to a pastebin?
2008-08-05T03:10:00.000Z	unop	sashimi	can you try adding rw to the list of mount options for this device
2008-08-05T03:13:00.000Z	unop	sashimi	i can't tell if the volume was properly mounted from the output you have there.  is the volume mounted?
2008-08-05T03:15:00.000Z	unop	sashimi	ok, let me try this out.
2008-08-05T03:22:00.000Z	unop	sashimi	hmm, seems to work flawlessly for me.  http://pastebin.com/d5212a529
2008-08-05T03:23:00.000Z	unop	sashimi	though i am not using the /etc/fstab to mount the volume (it shouldn't make a difference) .. not sure what is going on there with your volume
2008-08-05T03:25:00.000Z	unop	sashimi	it was already set
2008-08-05T03:25:00.000Z	unop	sashimi	though it doesn't make a difference - i adjusted ownership a little later down into the paste -- and still i get what i expect.
2008-08-05T03:27:00.000Z	unop	sashimi	well, since you want to affect permissions and ownership of the content on the volume -- you need to make changes _after_ mounting the volume, not before .. because, think about it, if i set some insecure permissions on a mount point and mounted someone else's stuff, i'd have complete access to the volume - the permissions of the mount point are changed on mount
2008-08-05T03:29:00.000Z	unop	sashimi	root:www-data is just user;group .. blah, etc are files on the volume
2008-08-05T03:56:00.000Z	unop	sashimi	yep, step in pm.
