2006-05-30T07:51:00.000Z	skippy81		just explain to them what you want to chmod the files too and they should be able to give you a command to copy and paste
2006-05-30T07:51:00.000Z	skippy81		im afraid chmoding is one of those things i can only get my head around when im actally trying to do it if you know what i mean
2006-05-30T07:51:00.000Z	skippy81		sorry im not a lot of help PerceptualChaos
2006-05-30T07:52:00.000Z	skippy81		:)
2006-05-30T07:53:00.000Z	skippy81		yeah let us know how it goes, theres 200 people in bash channel so you should have luck
2006-05-30T07:53:00.000Z	intelikey	skippy81	what's the question ?   i might know.
2006-05-30T07:54:00.000Z	skippy81	intelikey	 PerceptualChaos wanted to perform a recursive chmod on his home directory, to try and restore the permissions to how they all are by default
2006-05-30T07:57:00.000Z	intelikey	skippy81	a find string would be the best for that. PerceptualChaos " find $HOME -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \; ;find $HOME -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;   "
2006-05-30T07:59:00.000Z	skippy81	intelikey	 that would make sense, since it was on exec it was failing i think
2006-06-04T13:49:00.000Z	intelikey	skippy81	also   fdisk -l doesn't notice my root fs at all
2006-06-04T13:50:00.000Z	skippy81	intelikey	 yeah im not a fan of fdisk, i find i feel like im trying to do my partitioning with a paper bag over my head when i use it :)
2006-06-04T13:52:00.000Z	intelikey	skippy81	yeah i generally sujest cfdisk.   but that's not what i was refering to.  my root fs is on sda   so fdisk can't possably find it.
2006-06-04T13:53:00.000Z	skippy81	intelikey	 do you know of any decent program for linux that can recover deleted files from an NTFS partition? im doing some data recovery for a freind on wednesday, and id love to be able to do it in liunx
2006-06-04T13:54:00.000Z	intelikey	skippy81	no not on ntfs...
2006-06-06T08:35:00.000Z	skippy81	intelikey	 soz i mean are the kernel / packages a lot older?
2006-06-06T08:35:00.000Z	intelikey	skippy81	dated ?
2006-06-06T08:36:00.000Z	intelikey	skippy81	some....lot  depends on your perspective   but yes
2006-06-06T08:37:00.000Z	intelikey	skippy81	iirc the default kernel for sarge is 2.4
2006-06-06T11:04:00.000Z	intelikey	skippy81	sure i do that all the time.   you can cat or less or grep the file with the text and  gpm = general purpose mouse     copy and paste across tty's
