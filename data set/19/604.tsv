2011-11-23T23:11:00.000Z	theadmin	panther3	Sure thing, just ask
2011-11-23T23:13:00.000Z	theadmin	panther3	Can you ping anything?
2011-11-23T23:14:00.000Z	panther3	theadmin	got a load of text but can't really paste it as im on the laptop now and the desktop is where the problem is
2011-11-23T23:15:00.000Z	theadmin	panther3	Well, does it ping it?
2011-11-23T23:15:00.000Z	theadmin	panther3	I mean, is anything happening or do you just get an error like "No such host"?
2011-11-23T23:15:00.000Z	panther3	theadmin	no yeah something is happening...oh wait now it says 'destination host unreachable'
2011-11-23T23:15:00.000Z	theadmin	panther3	I see...
2011-11-23T23:16:00.000Z	theadmin	panther3	Do you actually have an IP? Type "ifconfig", find wlan0 and see if you have one
2011-11-23T23:17:00.000Z	panther3	theadmin	'no command "ipconfig" found
2011-11-23T23:17:00.000Z	theadmin	panther3	...read carefully, it's iFconfig
2011-11-23T23:17:00.000Z	panther3	theadmin	sorry, my bad
2011-11-23T23:18:00.000Z	panther3	theadmin	no mention of wlan0 but wlan2 is there
2011-11-23T23:18:00.000Z	theadmin	panther3	Fine, does it have an IP?
2011-11-23T23:19:00.000Z	panther3	theadmin	yes, i think so, 'inet addr: 192........'
2011-11-23T23:19:00.000Z	theadmin	panther3	Sounds fine... hm, strange
2011-11-23T23:21:00.000Z	panther3	theadmin	yesterday i tried sudo apt-get update and it seemed to be installing some updates from there, and then when i went back to the update manager the list seemed to have changed, and when i tried installing updates it said there wasn't enough memory..
2011-11-23T23:22:00.000Z	panther3	theadmin	but since then i had to reinstall ubuntu anyway because i tried to add memory to ubuntu partition but messed up windows partition in the proccess..not my finest hour
2011-11-23T23:29:00.000Z	panther3	theadmin	?
