2011-03-16T06:32:00.000Z	Bing0	sacarlson	i fail to see how that can control what websites i want to access?
2011-03-16T06:32:00.000Z	sacarlson	Bing0	iptables
2011-03-16T06:32:00.000Z	Bing0	sacarlson	or you mean config iptables to only allow that? oh ok
2011-03-16T06:32:00.000Z	Bing0	sacarlson	so far i found firestarter(firewall) that might deny all but approved hosts.
2011-03-16T06:33:00.000Z	sacarlson	Bing0	I just create iptables scripts but firestarter might work also
2011-03-16T06:33:00.000Z	Bing0	sacarlson	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=843510   <--- just found this too :)
2011-03-16T06:36:00.000Z	sacarlson	Bing0	that sounds like they just want to take out a few sites you want to take out all but two,  seems like there would be an easier way for you
2011-03-16T06:37:00.000Z	Bing0	sacarlson	all i want is two websites(gmail is one of them) accessible, the rest are denied.
2011-03-16T06:37:00.000Z	Bing0	sacarlson	if you think iptables is the route to go based on my needs then let me know a recipe :)
2011-03-16T06:37:00.000Z	sacarlson	Bing0	they all use iptables just a different user interface
2011-03-16T06:38:00.000Z	Bing0	sacarlson	such GUIs, yeah i assumed so.
2011-03-16T06:39:00.000Z	sacarlson	Bing0	try a few of them see if they do what you want.  problem with gmail is that it might change it's ip so maybe you need to look at bind9 to make sure that the name goes to where you want
2011-03-16T06:39:00.000Z	Bing0	sacarlson	ok thanks.  im thinking if i add hostnames(versus IP addys) that issue might not appear :)
2011-03-16T06:40:00.000Z	sacarlson	Bing0	I'm not sure how often google changes things and they also have about 10 backup sites
2011-03-16T06:40:00.000Z	Bing0		yeah
2011-03-16T06:41:00.000Z	sacarlson	Bing0	well with firestarter the name is used when it starts to run but just converts to ip until you restart the computer or the software
2011-03-16T06:41:00.000Z	sacarlson	Bing0	you might also note that google does alot of redirects
2011-03-16T06:41:00.000Z	Bing0	sacarlson	ok thanks for the insights... ill give the gui method a rip. then if that fails might end up here :)
