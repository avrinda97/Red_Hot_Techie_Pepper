2008-04-28T05:29:00.000Z	[DS]DragonSlayer		quick question: I wana install Ubuntu to my laptop, can i install ubuntu along w/ my NTFS (Windows) partition so i can have dual boot w/out deleting windows?
2008-04-28T05:29:00.000Z	Jordan_U	[DS]DragonSlayer	Yes, you can even do it without repartitioning at all with wubi!
2008-04-28T05:31:00.000Z	Jordan_U	[DS]DragonSlayer	It's not a very big difference, the only difference is disk access because it's NTFS, it's still all completely native ( no virtualization )
2008-04-28T05:47:00.000Z	Jordan_U	[DS]DragonSlayer	The installation will walk you through that
2008-04-28T05:53:00.000Z	Jordan_U	[DS]DragonSlayer	Yes
2008-04-28T06:13:00.000Z	Jordan_U	[DS]DragonSlayer	It depends on the laptop, it does for mine
2008-04-28T06:42:00.000Z	Jordan_U	[DS]DragonSlayer	Are you booted into Ubuntu right now?
2008-04-28T06:42:00.000Z	Jordan_U	[DS]DragonSlayer	Do you have a brightness control key on your keyboard ?
2008-04-28T06:44:00.000Z	Jordan_U	[DS]DragonSlayer	It works out of the box for me
2008-04-28T06:45:00.000Z	Jordan_U	[DS]DragonSlayer	The installed system and the Live system should be pretty much identical, unfortunately in your case
2008-04-28T06:47:00.000Z	Jordan_U	[DS]DragonSlayer	That is not to say that there is no way to get it working though :)
2008-04-28T07:00:00.000Z	Jordan_U	[DS]DragonSlayer	System -> Preferences -> Appearance -> Font, try changing the dpi
2008-04-28T07:04:00.000Z	Jordan_U	[DS]DragonSlayer	That's the normal default
2008-04-28T10:09:00.000Z	[DS]DragonSlayer	Jordan_U	is it possible to install add programs from the Ubuntu 8.04 disc instead of download from server? (i get really slow dl)
2008-04-28T10:10:00.000Z	Jordan_U	[DS]DragonSlayer	If you got the DVD then yes, is your internet connection slow or just the apt mirror?
2008-04-28T10:14:00.000Z	Jordan_U	[DS]DragonSlayer	Do you have the DVD or the CD install?
2008-04-28T10:14:00.000Z	Jordan_U	[DS]DragonSlayer	Then you have almost all of the apps on the CD then
2008-04-28T10:14:00.000Z	Jordan_U	[DS]DragonSlayer	Again, is it your internet connection that is slow or the server?
