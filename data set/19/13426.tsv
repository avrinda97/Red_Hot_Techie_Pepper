2005-06-08T12:04:00.000Z	struggler		anyone for a procmail / spamassassin question (local .procmailrc not executed) ?
2005-06-08T12:04:00.000Z	bob2	struggler	just ask...
2005-06-08T12:05:00.000Z	bob2	struggler	that's a MTA config issue, not a SA one
2005-06-08T12:06:00.000Z	bob2	struggler	what MTA are you using?
2005-06-08T12:06:00.000Z	struggler	bob2	ok.. can you help me
2005-06-08T12:07:00.000Z	struggler	bob2	postfix
2005-06-08T12:08:00.000Z	bob2	struggler	then ~/.procmailrc will be run by default
2005-06-08T12:08:00.000Z	bob2	struggler	watch your postfix logs to see what is happening
2005-06-08T12:10:00.000Z	bob2	struggler	global?
2005-06-08T12:10:00.000Z	bob2	struggler	you specifically configured postfix to use a global one?
2005-06-08T12:10:00.000Z	struggler	bob2	/etc/procmailrc
2005-06-08T12:10:00.000Z	struggler	bob2	nope, never touched postfix
2005-06-08T12:11:00.000Z	struggler	bob2	just followed spamassassin directions
2005-06-08T12:20:00.000Z	struggler	bob2	thanks for your time, I'll start looking at the postfix config, maybe there is something in there
2005-11-25T07:57:00.000Z	bob2	struggler	what're you trying to do?
2005-11-25T07:57:00.000Z	struggler	bob2	see what is in the initrd image, I think  it has remnants of an old md array
2005-11-25T07:58:00.000Z	bob2	struggler	it's a gzip'd ext2 filesystem in hoary, and a cpio archive on breezy, iirc
2005-11-25T08:00:00.000Z	struggler	bob2	i tried gzip, cpio just hangs, file says "inux Compressed ROM File System data"
2005-11-25T08:01:00.000Z	struggler	bob2	i tried compress and bzip2 as well
