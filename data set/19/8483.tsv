2008-09-21T04:24:00.000Z	Schuenemann		I'm getting this error when I run fdisk -l: Logical partitions are not in disk order. How do I fix this?
2008-09-21T04:25:00.000Z	HymnToLife	Schuenemann	it is ot an error
2008-09-21T04:25:00.000Z	HymnToLife		it means your partitions are not "ordered" on the disk
2008-09-21T04:25:00.000Z	Schuenemann	HymnToLife	but cfdisk can't even display them. It says they are overlapped.
2008-09-21T04:25:00.000Z	HymnToLife		like for example, sda6 is physically placed before sda5 on the disk
2008-09-21T04:25:00.000Z	HymnToLife		oh
2008-09-21T04:26:00.000Z	HymnToLife		if they are overlapped, it is indeed an error
2008-09-21T04:26:00.000Z	HymnToLife		but it's not the same thing as "nt in logical order"
2008-09-21T04:26:00.000Z	Schuenemann	HymnToLife	how do I fix that?
2008-09-21T04:26:00.000Z	Schuenemann	HymnToLife	cfdisk shows this error:  Fatal error: Invalid logical partition 7: increased logical partitions overlapped
2008-09-21T04:26:00.000Z	HymnToLife		hmm
2008-09-21T04:27:00.000Z	HymnToLife	Schuenemann	you could try gparted
2008-09-21T04:27:00.000Z	HymnToLife		but you might have to delete and recreate them
2008-09-21T04:27:00.000Z	Schuenemann	HymnToLife	I tried qtparted. It is a bit crazy, the free space of a partition is shown in a different one
2008-09-21T04:28:00.000Z	Schuenemann		I really messed something up
2008-09-21T04:30:00.000Z	Schuenemann		...
2008-09-21T04:33:00.000Z	Schuenemann	HymnToLife	you mean I'll have to delete them all?
2008-09-21T04:33:00.000Z	HymnToLife	Schuenemann	no, only the ones that overlap
2008-09-21T04:33:00.000Z	Schuenemann	HymnToLife	how can I know which ones? This thing is messed up
