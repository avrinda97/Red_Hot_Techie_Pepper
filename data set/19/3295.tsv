2010-08-28T12:50:00.000Z	trijntje		Hi all. I have a bootable usb-drive that I want to clone, but the new drive is not the exact same size, so dd is not an option. I already tried copying all files but it will not boot. What can I do to make this work?
2010-08-28T12:52:00.000Z	sacarlson	trijntje	is it at least 2 gig.  or maybe just 1 gig for none persistant is big enuf?
2010-08-28T12:53:00.000Z	trijntje	sacarlson	its 4 GB
2010-08-28T12:59:00.000Z	sacarlson	trijntje	there is the build in program in ubuntu 10.04 that makes a bootable install disk but I never got it to work for persistance.  that one can be run from System>Administration>Startup disk creator.  for persistance it seems to be broken.
2010-08-28T13:01:00.000Z	trijntje	sacarlson	I have a slightly weird setup, i'm now gonna try to install grub to the new usb from within the system
2010-08-28T13:02:00.000Z	sacarlson	trijntje	is it persistant?  If you find easy persistance builder on the linux side (I have now windows) let me know.
2010-08-28T13:03:00.000Z	sacarlson	trijntje	I have no windows
2010-08-28T13:06:00.000Z	trijntje	sacarlson	no, its not persistent
2010-08-28T13:06:00.000Z	sacarlson	trijntje	so why would it be wierd then?
2010-08-28T13:07:00.000Z	trijntje	sacarlson	I have full disk encryption with /boot on an external usb drive
2010-08-28T13:07:00.000Z	sacarlson	trijntje	what's the advantage of full encryption?  I guess so no one can modify the code you plan to run?
2010-08-28T13:09:00.000Z	trijntje	sacarlson	first of all its cool ;) Secondly it prevents someone modifying /boot to steal my key when i'm not around my laptop
2010-08-28T13:24:00.000Z	trijntje	sacarlson	yes, it prevents people from putting something in /boot when your not watching your laptop
2010-08-28T13:25:00.000Z	sacarlson	trijntje	makes sence
2010-08-28T13:26:00.000Z	trijntje	sacarlson	and it is cool to have such a setup ;)
2010-08-28T13:26:00.000Z	sacarlson	trijntje	to me it's trouble waiting to hapen
2010-08-28T13:27:00.000Z	sacarlson	trijntje	I would just worry about my personal data getting stolen.  there are other tools to verify if things have been changed
2010-08-28T13:27:00.000Z	trijntje	sacarlson	thats true, i've not done that on my main system, just my laptop
2010-08-28T13:28:00.000Z	trijntje	sacarlson	so its no big disaster when things break
