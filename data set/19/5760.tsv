2008-05-05T17:20:00.000Z	noob-africa_	Xcell	i am using NVIDIA drivers, not the ones from Ubuntu repos... i previously had a conflict, all the two drivers were installed
2008-05-05T17:20:00.000Z	noob-africa_	Xcell	and i used EnvyNG to install the drivers
2008-05-05T17:20:00.000Z	Xcell	noob-africa_	 do you have nvidia settings manager installed?
2008-05-05T17:20:00.000Z	noob-africa_	Xcell	even my desktop is messed up... the Power-off button is not in its usual place... lol

2008-05-05T17:23:00.000Z	noob-africa_	Xcell	so, before i sign out, how do i uninstall the NVIDIA driver from NVIDIA's repos?
2008-05-05T17:25:00.000Z	noob-africa_	Xcell	r u sure? i think it may cause a conflict as it did before... because i couldnt change the screen size (then) when i had two different versions of the NVIDIA driver...
2008-05-05T17:25:00.000Z	noob-africa_	Xcell	mind u, am using an older NVIDIA card... GeForce 6800
