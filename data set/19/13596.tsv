2005-02-26T13:30:00.000Z	topyli	gatan	plus intelligence =)
2005-02-26T13:32:00.000Z	topyli	gatan	see http://www.ubuntulinux.org/ubuntu/relationship/document_view for an explanation of the debian/ubuntu relationship
2005-02-26T13:33:00.000Z	gatan	topyli	Thank you!
2005-02-26T13:57:00.000Z	gatan	topyli	should i download: warty-release-install-powerpc.iso   ?
2005-02-26T13:58:00.000Z	topyli	gatan	if you have a power pc :)
2005-02-26T13:59:00.000Z	topyli	gatan	the debian/ubuntu philosophy page got you sold?

2005-02-26T14:02:00.000Z	topyli	gatan	i love debian but there are problems with it. so, ubuntu seemed kinda natural for me
2005-02-26T14:02:00.000Z	gatan	topyli	ok :)
2005-02-26T14:04:00.000Z	topyli	gatan	also, ubuntu seems to release a "preview" on the same day that gnome releases =)
