2010-11-10T02:14:00.000Z	bluethundr		I am trying to run some pgp commands on my ubuntu 10 client.. what package do I need to install so that I can speak pgpk? http://pastebin.ca/1986715
2010-11-10T02:14:00.000Z	jrib	bluethundr	I've always used gpg, is that not an option?
2010-11-10T02:16:00.000Z	jrib	bluethundr	I'm not familiar at all with pgp, but pgpk doesn't seem to be provided for it.  Maybe pgpk is pgp with some option?
2010-11-10T02:17:00.000Z	bluethundr	jrib	hmm.. possible I will check it out
2010-11-10T02:17:00.000Z	jrib	bluethundr	seems like the only binary it provides is /usr/bin/pgpgpg maybe check man pgpgpg
2010-11-10T02:18:00.000Z	bluethundr	jrib	on it!! :)
2010-11-19T05:34:00.000Z	jrib	bluethundr	apt-cache show
2010-11-19T05:34:00.000Z	jrib	bluethundr	or apt-cache depends even
2010-11-19T05:35:00.000Z	jrib	bluethundr	so just read debian/control, no?
2010-11-19T05:36:00.000Z	jrib	bluethundr	no question in there :)
2010-11-19T05:37:00.000Z	jrib	bluethundr	also ubuntu hardy is 8.04, 9.10 is karmic
2010-11-19T05:37:00.000Z	jrib	bluethundr	they're in the control file, though I'm not sure why you need to know them
2010-11-19T05:38:00.000Z	jrib	bluethundr	are you creating an openssh package from scratch instead of patching the existing one for some reason?
2010-11-19T05:38:00.000Z	bluethundr	jrib	ok thanks.. I am a little more used to centOS packaging. this is my first attempt at a debian style package
2010-11-19T05:39:00.000Z	bluethundr	jrib	I did a custom install of openssh-5.6p1 that includes the openssh-LPK patch and am attempting to turn it into an ubuntu package
2010-11-19T05:39:00.000Z	jrib	bluethundr	you should just patch the existing openssh package
2010-11-19T05:40:00.000Z	jrib	bluethundr	but you can upgrade the existing package
2010-11-19T05:42:00.000Z	jrib	bluethundr	there's also #ubuntu-packaging and #ubuntu-motu that can help you with specific questions
2010-11-19T05:42:00.000Z	bluethundr	jrib	excellent stuff thanks for the tip!
