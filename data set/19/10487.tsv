2006-06-09T13:27:00.000Z	Madpilot	xxozxx	for Dapper, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/6666
2006-06-09T13:30:00.000Z	Madpilot	xxozxx	those are 6.06 Dapper sources
2006-06-09T13:30:00.000Z	Madpilot	xxozxx	Breezy repos: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/6047
2006-06-09T13:32:00.000Z	xxozxx	Madpilot	im guessing the breezy works with 5.04 too?

2006-06-09T13:33:00.000Z	Madpilot	xxozxx	gah, sorry, it's late. 5.04 = Hoary, 5.10 = Breezy, 6.06 = Dapper
2006-06-09T13:33:00.000Z	xxozxx	Madpilot	i have hoary
2006-06-09T13:35:00.000Z	Madpilot	xxozxx	you'd need to upgrade to 5.10, then to 6.06
2006-06-09T13:36:00.000Z	Madpilot	xxozxx	http://wiki.ubuntu.com/BreezyUpgrade
2006-06-12T13:23:00.000Z	Madpilot	xxozxx	that's because it doesn't exist
