2005-08-08T13:37:00.000Z	olivier		... no way to install those $$##$$ nvidia drivers ....
2005-08-08T13:38:00.000Z	olivier		I wonder how pple do, I mean, nvidia has like what 50% of the graphic card market??? why on earth is that so hard to install the video drivers?
2005-08-08T13:39:00.000Z	SquareGuy	olivier	actually i think intel has the greatest % of video market - their integrated solutions
2005-08-08T13:43:00.000Z	SquareGuy	olivier	all you should need is the headers and they are probably installed by default just use synaptic and sezarch for them
2005-08-08T13:43:00.000Z	SquareGuy	olivier	i meant not by default, whoops
2005-08-08T13:44:00.000Z	olivier	SquareGuy	ok, I'll restart X ...
2005-08-08T13:47:00.000Z	SquareGuy	olivier	if you don't know then you don't.  just type cat /proc/cpuinfo to be sure
2005-08-08T13:47:00.000Z	olivier	SquareGuy	thanks
2005-08-08T13:47:00.000Z	SquareGuy	olivier	np
2005-08-08T13:50:00.000Z	SquareGuy	olivier	whats not working?
2005-08-08T13:51:00.000Z	SquareGuy	olivier	you dl them from nvidia i am assuming?
2005-08-08T13:53:00.000Z	SquareGuy	olivier	so what is happening when you try to install them?
2005-08-08T13:54:00.000Z	SquareGuy	olivier	all you need is the headers but if you have the sources you will need to make sure they are setup first.  the easiest way is with the headers... trust me
2005-08-08T13:55:00.000Z	SquareGuy	olivier	for you exact kernel revision?
2005-08-08T13:55:00.000Z	olivier	SquareGuy	ha well, that's a good question :p
2005-08-08T14:05:00.000Z	SquareGuy	olivier	yeah that is a problem.  if you have the same sources and patches as your current kernel just make sure they are untarred/linked to /usr/src/linux copy the config file from /boot to /usr/src/linux/.config do a make mrproper and a make modules.  i'm thinking thats all that would need to be done.  anyone feel free to correct me if im wrong
2005-08-08T14:07:00.000Z	olivier	SquareGuy	ok, I already did the mrproper I think ... I'll do the modules
2005-08-08T14:09:00.000Z	SquareGuy	olivier	im not sure you might need to build lernel too.  im not sure what all nvidia is looking for.  if it bitches that your source do not match your kernel i would uninstall the headers/sources and install just the headers making sure they are the correct ones
2005-08-08T14:10:00.000Z	SquareGuy	olivier	cool
