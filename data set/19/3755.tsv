2010-03-28T08:31:00.000Z	genii	DarthPuff	You have something like: twm &        in .xinitrc  or .xsession   ?
2010-03-28T08:33:00.000Z	DarthPuff	genii	i just made an xinitrc in ~ and wrote twm in it. i then tried xinit... again a blank screen
2010-03-28T08:34:00.000Z	genii	DarthPuff	You have more than one video output? Could be one not plugged in is being used for :0.0
2010-03-28T08:35:00.000Z	DarthPuff	genii	my monitor section in xorg.conf is pretty plain
2010-03-28T08:36:00.000Z	DarthPuff	genii	just identifier, horisync, vertrefresh, and displaysize
2010-03-28T08:38:00.000Z	genii	DarthPuff	So your /home/username/.xinitrc   file has in it:   twm &                 with the ampersand?
2010-03-28T08:38:00.000Z	DarthPuff	genii	no ampersand. let me try that
2010-03-28T08:39:00.000Z	DarthPuff	genii	alright, now it starts up to a screen (still blank) and then quits
2010-03-28T08:39:00.000Z	DarthPuff	genii	no errors
2010-03-28T08:40:00.000Z	DarthPuff	genii	it does say "ddxSigGiveUp: closing log" at the end, but i don't think that it is important
2010-03-28T08:44:00.000Z	genii	DarthPuff	Does:  xinit -- :0                           give same?
2010-03-28T08:44:00.000Z	DarthPuff	genii	yup
2010-03-28T08:48:00.000Z	genii	DarthPuff	When you installed X did you also install something like the right xserver-xorg-video-drivername   for your video card?
2010-03-28T08:49:00.000Z	DarthPuff	genii	i915 is modprobed and seems to be working and under the video device in xorg i have intel as the driver.
2010-03-28T08:54:00.000Z	DarthPuff	genii	i think i have something
2010-03-28T08:55:00.000Z	DarthPuff	genii	fatal IO error 104
2010-03-28T09:01:00.000Z	DarthPuff	genii	i have xinit working
2010-03-28T09:02:00.000Z	genii	DarthPuff	Apologies on lag, it is late where I am. Did it require some other display than :0  or was it xorg.conf, something else?
2010-03-28T09:03:00.000Z	DarthPuff	genii	i have no idea... xinit without an xinitrc starts x, but with it it won't. also if i type startx i get a blank screen.
