2010-06-23T12:26:00.000Z	qwiksilver711		so noone has any ideas on my graphics card issue?
2010-06-23T12:27:00.000Z	om26er	qwiksilver711	you are facing bug 550833
2010-06-23T12:15:00.000Z	om26er	qwiksilver711	what happens if you pullout the nvidia card? does intel work then?
2010-06-23T12:16:00.000Z	qwiksilver711	om26er	its a laptop, and the nvidia is part of the motherboard... yes i know it doesnt make sense, but it really is
2010-06-23T12:17:00.000Z	om26er	qwiksilver711	so your laptop have both intel and nvidia graphics ?
2010-06-23T12:18:00.000Z	om26er	qwiksilver711	can you give the make/model of the laptop
2010-06-23T12:21:00.000Z	om26er	qwiksilver711	you could try to switch to intel from windows and then come back to ubuntu to see if intel works in that case
2010-06-23T12:21:00.000Z	qwiksilver711	om26er	it does not, ubuntu just turns it on, i can go into windows and turn it off, and i log onto ubuntu and it turns the nvidia on

2010-06-23T12:28:00.000Z	qwiksilver711	om26er	is there anything i can do to help resolve that bug? i'm an idiot, but i can submit like bug reports or whatever
2010-06-23T12:31:00.000Z	om26er	qwiksilver711	one commenter on the bug report says there is experimental support in the latest kernel. you could give it a try. which architect are you using i.e. 32bit or 64 ?
2010-06-23T12:32:00.000Z	qwiksilver711	om26er	64 bit
2010-06-23T12:33:00.000Z	om26er	qwiksilver711	download and install this. then reboot it may work. http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v2.6.34-lucid/linux-image-2.6.34-020634-generic_2.6.34-020634_amd64.deb
2010-06-23T12:33:00.000Z	qwiksilver711	om26er	is it something that may possibly screw my install up?
2010-06-23T12:34:00.000Z	om26er	qwiksilver711	not exactly. you can simply come back to the previous kernel
2010-06-23T12:37:00.000Z	qwiksilver711	om26er	how do i install this file?
2010-06-23T12:41:00.000Z	om26er	qwiksilver711	just double click and install.
2010-06-23T12:42:00.000Z	om26er	qwiksilver711	na you are not stupid. :)
2010-06-23T12:42:00.000Z	qwiksilver711	om26er	ok, we'll settle with just a bit slow
