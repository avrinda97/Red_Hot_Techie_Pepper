2011-11-11T21:05:00.000Z	mengesb		I have a three monitor display system, and Ubuntu with NVIDIA drivers recognizes the monitors in 2-display pairs (2880x900 +1440+0 in my three display scenario). This makes 'maximizing' on my left two displays expand to both, whereas the right display is treated independent, and expands to only the one. Is there a way to constrict them without doing seperate x displays?
2011-11-11T21:06:00.000Z	dr_willis	mengesb	 ive never did manage to get 3 monitors working totally right.   You are using a single card with 3 video outs? or 2 cards?
2011-11-11T21:07:00.000Z	mengesb	dr_willis	I'm using a single card with support for 4xDVI heads; Galaxy MDTx4
2011-11-11T21:08:00.000Z	dr_willis	mengesb	 you must have a large desk. :) not seen that card..
2011-11-11T21:08:00.000Z	mengesb	dr_willis	It works well ultimately... but every time I maximize on either of the left two monitors... I get a giant 2880x900 application, versus the right monitor it treats it like 1440x900 added...
2011-11-11T21:09:00.000Z	dr_willis	mengesb	 you have restarted X since enabling all 3? ive noticed oddities if i dont resart X after setting my twin monitors up.
2011-11-11T21:09:00.000Z	mengesb	dr_willis	I've rebooted several times actually
2011-11-11T21:10:00.000Z	mengesb	dr_willis	but it appears to show only 2 displays... with it merging the left two
2011-11-11T21:10:00.000Z	mengesb	dr_willis	I guess that's more of a nvidia issue?
2011-11-11T21:10:00.000Z	mengesb	dr_willis	well, I haven't looked at my xorg.conf lately
2011-11-11T21:12:00.000Z	mengesb	dr_willis	wow, just one monitor defined, one device defined, and one screen defined
2011-11-11T21:12:00.000Z	dr_willis	mengesb	 the nvidia settings tool just shows 2 displays>?
2011-11-11T21:13:00.000Z	mengesb	dr_willis	yeah, one display shows 1440x900, the other shows 2880x900
2011-11-11T21:15:00.000Z	mengesb	dr_willis	 i guess that's my issue, it combines two monitors and the hardware reports one display
2011-11-11T21:16:00.000Z	dr_willis	mengesb	 i wonder if its not a limit of the card.. id be curious.. if you moved the 3rd monitor over to the other port if it would start getting 'merged' with the Other display...
2011-11-11T21:17:00.000Z	mengesb	dr_willis	yeah, when i have two ports of the display port occupied, it merges them into one display...
2011-11-11T21:17:00.000Z	dr_willis	mengesb	 so its sort of shareing 2 ports per gpu in the card perhaps?
2011-11-11T21:18:00.000Z	mengesb	dr_willis	it would appear so
2011-11-11T21:18:00.000Z	mengesb	dr_willis	unfortunately.... maybe I can see if galaxy can help, or perhaps nvidia
