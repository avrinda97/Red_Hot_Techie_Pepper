2009-06-08T06:08:00.000Z	limpc	quantumkenny	have you even bothered to consult google?
2009-06-08T06:08:00.000Z	quantumkenny		yes, for over two months I have played with it to get it working.  skype, sound recorder and the OS seem to work just fine with the usb mic
2009-06-08T06:08:00.000Z	quantumkenny		the webcam works fine
2009-06-08T06:08:00.000Z	quantumkenny		i'm having issues with the usb audio/built in mic
2009-06-08T06:09:00.000Z	limpc	quantumkenny	what driver do you have installed
2009-06-08T06:09:00.000Z	quantumkenny		the uvc driver
2009-06-08T06:09:00.000Z	limpc		hmm
2009-06-08T06:10:00.000Z	limpc		not sure then.. if sound isnt working its probably an issue with uvcvideo, im using pwc
2009-06-08T06:10:00.000Z	limpc		i have a qc pro 4k tho
2009-06-08T06:11:00.000Z	limpc		which version of uvc do you have, quantumkenny?
2009-06-08T06:11:00.000Z	quantumkenny	limpc	maybe the issue is more vlc related, i'm not sure.  I can capture video with no issue
2009-06-08T06:11:00.000Z	limpc	quantumkenny	capturing video has no relation to audio input ;)

2009-06-08T06:14:00.000Z	quantumkenny		my goal is to create a video journal
2009-06-08T06:15:00.000Z	quantumkenny		the video portion seems to work, the audio does not
2009-06-08T06:15:00.000Z	limpc	quantumkenny	see #2 of that list
2009-06-08T06:17:00.000Z	quantumkenny	limpc	the audio does work in the gnome sound recorder & skype with no issue  just vlc seems to be the issue
2009-06-08T06:17:00.000Z	limpc	quantumkenny	i see. ask in #vlc then :)
