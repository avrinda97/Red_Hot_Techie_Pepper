2010-06-20T18:12:00.000Z	jellow	bazhang	http://code.google.com/p/googlecl/
2010-06-20T18:12:00.000Z	bazhang	jellow	what is the package name
2010-06-20T18:12:00.000Z	jellow	bazhang	its not in repositry
2010-06-21T17:15:00.000Z	bazhang	jellow	mediatomb?
2010-06-21T17:17:00.000Z	jellow	bazhang	Never used it can it stream .mkv files ?
2010-06-21T17:17:00.000Z	bazhang	jellow	not sure, perhaps give it a try
2010-08-27T05:31:00.000Z	bazhang	jellow	very bad idea
2010-08-27T11:11:00.000Z	bazhang	jellow	stop that
2010-08-27T11:42:00.000Z	bazhang	jellow	this is not the terminal
2010-08-27T11:42:00.000Z	jellow	bazhang	yes oddly my other screen keeps outputting to this one :P
2010-09-14T17:45:00.000Z	bazhang	jellow	that is not the way to do it; enable partner repo for that
2010-09-14T17:46:00.000Z	jellow	bazhang	I don't want the one from repo it's old
2010-09-14T17:46:00.000Z	bazhang	jellow	you dont want some rpm either
2010-09-14T17:46:00.000Z	jellow	bazhang	but i converted it to .deb
2010-09-14T17:46:00.000Z	bazhang	jellow	that is explicitly not supported
2010-09-14T18:01:00.000Z	bazhang	jellow	any PPA is risky. especially for such a small version difference, its silly to use
2012-03-29T16:14:00.000Z	jellow	bazhang	 b43-fwcutter says it cannot not extract the firmware because of md5sum not matching up
