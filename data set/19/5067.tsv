2010-11-15T19:59:00.000Z	Yam_		Hi room,
2010-11-15T19:59:00.000Z	Yam_		I badly need help
2010-11-15T20:00:00.000Z	Yam_		Ubuntu asked me to install the newest driver for my ATI card, and after I installed it,  it only goes to the Ubuntu loading screen and then the monitor shuts off
2010-11-15T20:01:00.000Z	Walex	Yam_	you probably need to have the GUI/X server configuration reset. There are a few pages on the Wiki who give details on doing that.
2010-11-15T20:03:00.000Z	Walex	Yam_	you need to get into the console, and then start the reconfig. The relevant wiki page has the details
2010-11-15T20:06:00.000Z	Walex	Yam_	CTRL-ALT-F1, but please read the relevant Wiki page
2010-11-15T20:07:00.000Z	Walex	Yam_	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=690760
2010-11-15T20:07:00.000Z	Walex	Yam_	case "1b)" in that page
2010-11-15T20:23:00.000Z	Walex	Yam_	if it just beeps that probably it has not not booted into GNU/Linux yet. Then you have a bigger problem than the GUI.
2010-11-15T20:24:00.000Z	Walex	Yam_	ahhhhh then if you can get into the commmand promp follow the instructions in that page.
2010-11-15T20:24:00.000Z	Walex	Yam_	 note that command prompt is probably the single user command prompt. CTRL-ALT-F1 works if the system has booted normally in multiuser mode.
2010-11-15T20:25:00.000Z	Walex	Yam_	that's another way.
2010-11-15T20:25:00.000Z	Walex	Yam_	not.
2010-11-15T20:26:00.000Z	Walex	Yam_	'root'
2010-11-15T20:38:00.000Z	Walex	Yam_	been away a bit
2010-11-15T20:38:00.000Z	Walex	Yam_	if the ATI driver is not working, GDM cannot start. The key command is the X reconfigure.
2010-11-15T20:41:00.000Z	Walex	Yam_	wiki page says how to reconfigure X... You don't need to follow *all* steps, just those that match your situation.
2010-11-15T20:51:00.000Z	Walex	Yam_	comething like that  indeed.
2010-11-15T20:53:00.000Z	Walex	Yam_	the whole sequence of commands has to work. The really important one is that with 'dpkg-reconfigure'
