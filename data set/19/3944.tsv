2009-12-07T22:45:00.000Z	khensthoth	xander	As I remember, PulseAudio (Part of the sound system) is a mess in 8.04, If you could, it'd be better to use the latest version of Ubuntu
2009-12-07T22:47:00.000Z	khensthoth	xander	Flash didn't work as in no video at all or no sound? Did you install the flash-nonfree package?
2009-12-07T22:48:00.000Z	khensthoth	xander	Then have you installed ubuntu-restricted-extras. Try installing that, then see if your flash works
2009-12-07T22:49:00.000Z	khensthoth	xander	Go to the terminal at Application > Accessories > Terminal
2009-12-07T22:49:00.000Z	khensthoth	xander	Type: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras
2009-12-07T22:51:00.000Z	khensthoth	xander	Wait for it to finish - it's downloading and installing quite a lot of packages.
2009-12-07T22:52:00.000Z	khensthoth	xander	ubuntu-restrcted-extras not areas
2009-12-07T22:53:00.000Z	khensthoth	xander	And Flash still do not work?
2009-12-07T22:55:00.000Z	khensthoth	xander	In the terminal, type alsamixer
2009-12-07T22:56:00.000Z	khensthoth	xander	Use left/right arrow keys to navigate, up/down to increase and decrease volume. Now - find Mic. What's the volume?
2009-12-07T22:58:00.000Z	khensthoth	xander	Yup. Turn that down to 0%
2009-12-07T22:58:00.000Z	khensthoth	xander	Now speak to the microphone to see if you still hear yourself.
2009-12-07T23:01:00.000Z	khensthoth	xander	Weird.. Thinking.
2009-12-07T23:02:00.000Z	khensthoth	xander	If you switched from mic1 to mic2 you might possibly not be recording yourself through mic anymore. Try Applications, Sound and Video > Sound Recorder. Record something see if your mic still works
2009-12-07T23:06:00.000Z	khensthoth	xander	I'd  really recommend you to upgrade to Ubuntu 9.10, or at least 9.04. PulseAudio on various releases have various issues. 9.10 is the only which works perfectly for me.
