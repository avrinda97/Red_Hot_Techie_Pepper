2009-08-05T00:23:00.000Z	codeshah		ok, I installed php4 from source...
2009-08-05T00:23:00.000Z	codeshah		but now how do I get apache to use it along with php5? hrrmpf
2009-08-05T00:23:00.000Z	ikonia	codeshah	multiple php modules is not good
2009-08-05T00:23:00.000Z	codeshah	ikonia	no?
2009-08-05T00:23:00.000Z	codeshah	ikonia	hmm, if I am trying to do some testing of a php4 app on my local server, what is best?
2009-08-05T00:23:00.000Z	ikonia	codeshah	you'd need to build php with the --with-apache option and have the source/headers of the apache package your using
2009-08-05T00:23:00.000Z	ikonia	codeshah	run two seperate servers, or two instances
2009-08-05T00:24:00.000Z	codeshah	ikonia	ok, I see
2009-08-05T00:24:00.000Z	ikonia	codeshah	php4 is pretty much dead, so I'd try to avoid using it full stop
2009-09-08T02:53:00.000Z	ikonia	codeshah	depends if it's packaged up for that version
2009-09-08T02:53:00.000Z	codeshah	ikonia	where can I check ?
2009-09-08T02:53:00.000Z	ikonia	codeshah	in the package manager
2009-09-08T02:54:00.000Z	ikonia	codeshah	I wouldn't try to put that on anything post 6.06
2009-09-08T02:54:00.000Z	codeshah	ikonia	ok, so probably best to compile autoconf 2.13 manually [litespeed needs it]
2009-09-08T02:54:00.000Z	ikonia	codeshah	will it not use a later version ?
2009-09-08T02:55:00.000Z	codeshah	ikonia	no :( http://wiki.cpaneldirect.net/wiki/index.php/Posix.c:471:_error:_%27struct_utsname%27_has_no_member_named_%27domainname%27
2009-09-08T02:55:00.000Z	ikonia	codeshah	log a but with cpanel to update their software then, as that's an old version
2009-09-08T02:56:00.000Z	codeshah	ikonia	k
2012-01-18T00:58:00.000Z	ikonia	codeshah	that's not really it's function
