2007-07-10T09:09:00.000Z	Fezzler		Okay.  My memory is "there."  I ran memtest from boot disk.  Okay.  Boot CD saw two Hard Drives.  Reinstalled xconfig and nvidia.
2007-07-10T09:10:00.000Z	Fezzler		Uninstalled troublesome programs.  Why is X or GNOME freezing?

2007-07-10T09:11:00.000Z	Fezzler		Just tried to launch another app on top of gaim.  Frozen again.  Ugh/   What can we do.
2007-07-10T09:13:00.000Z	Fezzler		Is freezing X server and/or Gnome beyond expertise of this forum?  I'm ready and willing with command line options.

2007-07-10T09:15:00.000Z	Fezzler		Frog: or do you mean literally run "check  /var/log/Xorg.0.log"

2007-07-10T09:17:00.000Z	Frogzoo		!iso | rathel: just a guess, but you probly need to mount the iso on a loopback
2007-07-10T09:20:00.000Z	Fezzler		Frog: Only EE is "EE xf86OpenSerial: Cannot open device /dev/input/wacom  no such file or directory"  (I have no wacom device)
2007-07-10T09:21:00.000Z	Fezzler		Frog: Boy lots of Nvidia settings in there!
2007-07-10T09:22:00.000Z	Fezzler		Frog: Now what.  PS - GNOME is now frozen as Gaim, Beryl, Network, Volume, Trash still working.
