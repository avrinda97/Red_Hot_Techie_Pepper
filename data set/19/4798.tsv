2011-02-23T22:39:00.000Z	ruan		if exist "file.dat" rm file.dat         what am i doing wrong?
2011-02-23T22:40:00.000Z	ruan		alright, but this is extremely basic
2011-02-23T22:41:00.000Z	Pici	ruan	So that makes it even more on-topic for that channel.
2011-02-23T22:41:00.000Z	Pici	ruan	They are very helpful there.
2011-02-23T22:42:00.000Z	Pici	ruan	There are many things wrong with that script, they have links that can get you more accquanted with scripting.
2011-03-02T21:46:00.000Z	Pici	ruan	Different releases of Ubuntu use different kernel versions.
2011-03-02T21:46:00.000Z	ruan	Pici	ah ok
2011-03-15T19:12:00.000Z	Pici	ruan	There are a lot of ways.  Best to ask in #irssi
2011-03-15T19:14:00.000Z	Pici	ruan	You shouldn't be modyifying your irssi config manually. #irssi can tell you the right way to change that setting.
2011-03-16T22:03:00.000Z	Pici	ruan	yes.
2011-03-22T22:18:00.000Z	Pici	ruan	Deban is not supported here, and that is a debian repository.
2011-03-29T23:07:00.000Z	Pici	ruan	What exactly are you trying to accomplish?
2011-03-29T23:07:00.000Z	ruan	Pici	sshing into my pc
2011-03-29T23:07:00.000Z	ruan	Pici	without the lan ip
2011-03-30T19:58:00.000Z	Pici	ruan	6 Months.
2011-04-12T18:32:00.000Z	Pici	ruan	Well, if I'm not mistaken, one of the steps that the Ubuntu upgrade tools do is first install ubuntu-minimal if it is not installed, as its a good place to start for determining what dependencies need to be upgraded/installed.
2011-05-11T19:45:00.000Z	Pici	ruan	no
