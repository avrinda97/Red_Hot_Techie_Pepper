2009-05-01T01:42:00.000Z	iD4rK		to fix your flash issues
2009-05-01T01:43:00.000Z	iD4rK		If you ahve problems with flash do the following: go to your packet manager, search for flash, mark "flashplugin-nonfree" for compelte unisntall and mark "adobe-flashplugin" for isntall try this!
2009-05-01T01:44:00.000Z	iD4rK		it worked good for me
2009-05-01T01:44:00.000Z	scribawf	iD4rK	think I tried that also (on 9.04 kernal) that is
2009-05-01T01:45:00.000Z	iD4rK	scribawf	 yeah, i upgraded from 8.10 to 9.04 and had problems with flash first, all gone now
2009-05-01T01:48:00.000Z	iD4rK	scribawf	make sure you closed firefox, and try to only install the "adobe-flashplugin" and see what happens
2009-05-01T01:50:00.000Z	iD4rK	scribawf	you can search for "adobe-flashplugin" in your synaptic
2009-05-01T01:51:00.000Z	iD4rK	scribawf	it really should work, just make sure ur mozilla is closed
2009-05-01T02:08:00.000Z	iD4rK	scribawf	:(
2009-05-01T02:09:00.000Z	iD4rK	scribawf	there is for sure a way to fix your flash, but i out of answers atm, google a while you might find something
2009-05-01T02:12:00.000Z	iD4rK	scribawf	if you find a solution post it on the ubuntu forums, i bet you are not the only one out there with that particular problem
2009-05-01T02:16:00.000Z	iD4rK	scribawf	thanks :D
2009-05-01T02:16:00.000Z	iD4rK	scribawf	the boobies of the movie make's it so much better *uhg*
