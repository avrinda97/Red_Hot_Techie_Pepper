2006-12-09T15:54:00.000Z	mojojojo_		hi! My Ubuntu is terribly sloooooow compared to windows for example. Do you know what might be the cause??
2006-12-09T15:54:00.000Z	nothlit	mojojojo_	you haven't installed your graphics drivers
2006-12-09T15:54:00.000Z	nothlit	mojojojo_	describe where this slowdown is
2006-12-09T15:54:00.000Z	nothlit	mojojojo_	are you running off the livecd?
2006-12-09T15:56:00.000Z	mojojojo_	nothlit	no, it's from hard drive. First programs work very slow and secondly there is a time when entire system doesn't respond
2006-12-09T15:57:00.000Z	nothlit	mojojojo_	open a terminal and type top and hit enter
2006-12-09T15:58:00.000Z	mojojojo_	nothlit	well it says firefox takes about 60% of cpu and xmms about 15%
2006-12-09T15:58:00.000Z	nothlit	mojojojo_	what windows are you comparing it to and whats your ram/cpu speed
2006-12-09T15:59:00.000Z	mojojojo_	nothlit	winx XP. about 700 MB of RAM, CPU 1,8 AMD Athlon
2006-12-09T15:59:00.000Z	nothlit	mojojojo_	is it net applications that are slow, or everything
2006-12-09T15:59:00.000Z	mojojojo_	nothlit	everything
2006-12-09T16:00:00.000Z	nothlit	mojojojo_	was the livecd just as slow?
2006-12-09T16:00:00.000Z	nothlit	mojojojo_	what res are you using
2006-12-09T16:00:00.000Z	mojojojo_	nothlit	sometimes even terminal hangs. I haven't used livecd
2006-12-09T16:01:00.000Z	mojojojo_	nothlit	what is "res"?
2006-12-09T16:02:00.000Z	nothlit	mojojojo_	resolution
2006-12-09T16:03:00.000Z	mojojojo_	nothlit	you mean of the screen? it's 1024x768 75Mhz
2006-12-09T16:05:00.000Z	nothlit	mojojojo_	have you run linux before? any livecds? do you have any esoteric hardware?
2006-12-09T16:08:00.000Z	mojojojo_	nothlit	yup, slackware - it ran really nice... no, I don't have any... apart from Pen Drive, which isn't esoteric, I guess. Looking at top, I am under impression that kernel is dividing cpu time strangely, for example a while ago xmms consumed 95% percent of its usage!!
