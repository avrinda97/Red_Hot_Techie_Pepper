2007-02-03T11:40:00.000Z	CokeNCode		i'm thinking someone might be hacking me
2007-02-03T11:41:00.000Z	CokeNCode		and accessing all my files
2007-02-03T11:41:00.000Z	CokeNCode		altho, i hate to think that's the case
2007-02-03T11:41:00.000Z	CokeNCode		does anyone else have this running ?

2007-02-03T11:41:00.000Z	CokeNCode		that running ... 'afbackup'
2007-02-03T11:42:00.000Z	rjm1982	CokeNCode	it may have been installed as a dependency to something
2007-02-03T11:42:00.000Z	rjm1982	CokeNCode	Its highly unlikely that you're being messed with
2007-02-03T11:42:00.000Z	CokeNCode	rjm1982	ok ... thanks.
2007-02-03T11:42:00.000Z	CokeNCode		i'm a bit paranoid
2007-02-03T11:43:00.000Z	CokeNCode		i have some very mischievous "friends"
2007-02-03T11:43:00.000Z	CokeNCode		well, former friends
2007-02-03T11:43:00.000Z	CokeNCode		hmmm, it is installed
2007-02-03T11:43:00.000Z	CokeNCode		ok
2007-02-03T11:43:00.000Z	CokeNCode		i wonder if uninstalling it will break anything
2007-02-03T11:43:00.000Z	CokeNCode		does anyone else have it installed ?
2007-02-03T11:44:00.000Z	CokeNCode		before i dump it
2007-02-03T11:44:00.000Z	CokeNCode		'afbackup'
2007-02-03T11:44:00.000Z	rjm1982	CokeNCode	just check to see (via properties in synaptic) if anything depends on it before you remove it
