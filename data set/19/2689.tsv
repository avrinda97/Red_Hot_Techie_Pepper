2010-01-29T13:15:00.000Z	Diverdude		Is there any way you can have like a 5 day local weather forecast displayed on the desktop...e.g. in the calender window in the upper right corner?
2010-01-29T13:17:00.000Z	Kyletstrand	Diverdude	there's also a simple applet that does it, i haven't used it myself, but i know it's there.  you can just right click your panel and add the 'Weather Report"
2010-01-29T13:18:00.000Z	Diverdude	Kyletstrand	how does that work
2010-01-29T13:18:00.000Z	Kyletstrand	Diverdude	the applet it self or installing it?  i'm not familiar with the program, i just know it exists
2010-01-29T13:19:00.000Z	Diverdude	Kyletstrand	hmm i see..you don't know the name of it?
2010-01-29T13:20:00.000Z	Kyletstrand	Diverdude	it's called "Weather Report."  right click your panel and click on 'Add to Panel' and it's in that list of applets
2010-01-29T13:21:00.000Z	Diverdude	Kyletstrand	yes...i found it...but it says weatherreport not available for current location :(
2010-01-29T13:22:00.000Z	Kyletstrand	Diverdude	hmm...i'm playing around with it too, but i'm getting a full detals
2010-01-29T13:22:00.000Z	Diverdude	Kyletstrand	where are you sitting? Maybe i can try to change my location to the same place on the computer and see what happens
2010-01-29T13:23:00.000Z	Kyletstrand	Diverdude	Rochester, Minnesota, USA
2010-01-29T13:24:00.000Z	Diverdude	Kyletstrand	hmm it did not change anything...i still have no details in my weather report
2010-01-29T13:24:00.000Z	Kyletstrand	Diverdude	did you click update? i had to click that to get the details
2010-01-29T13:24:00.000Z	Diverdude	Kyletstrand	yes i tried that several times
2010-01-29T13:25:00.000Z	Kyletstrand	Diverdude	not sure.
2010-01-29T13:28:00.000Z	Kyletstrand	Diverdude	Can you get the any location information, like for random places, or are they all coming up blank?
2010-01-29T13:35:00.000Z	Kyletstrand	Diverdude	you're getting current info but no forecast for your location?  how about radar map?
2010-01-29T13:35:00.000Z	Diverdude	Kyletstrand	i can get the radar map tab...and window....but its just totally gray...no map in there
2010-01-29T13:36:00.000Z	Kyletstrand	Diverdude	did you right click the icon and check preferences?  it's in the general tab to enable radar map
