2009-07-04T07:18:00.000Z	djzn		hello... need big help here!!! I was doing an system update, and it wanted to *change menu.lst* - at the time I told it to *keep current file unchanged*... but my kernel did not get updated... now I need to know the command to go back to that screen, so that it can generate the kernel entry in grub with proper UUID... help!
2009-07-04T07:19:00.000Z	ehazlett	djzn	run sudo update-grub
2009-07-04T07:20:00.000Z	djzn		enhazlett: it does not work.... no new kernel entry is added to menu.lst, and no uuid number
2009-07-04T07:20:00.000Z	djzn		enhazlett: the graph screen that comes up when that happens, which command is that?
2009-07-04T07:22:00.000Z	djzn		you know when you update the kernel... through system updates, there comes a screen UI asking what to do with MENU.LST... i need to run *THAT*...which command is it
2009-07-04T07:23:00.000Z	ehazlett	djzn	that is the dpkg configuration screen
2009-07-04T07:23:00.000Z	djzn	ehazlett	yes!! dpkg configuration screen.. which one is it for update menu lst?
2009-07-04T07:24:00.000Z	ehazlett	djzn	try dpkg-reconfigure linux-image-<version>
2009-07-04T07:24:00.000Z	ehazlett	djzn	whichever kernel you installed
2009-07-04T07:26:00.000Z	djzn	ehazlett	I don't get the graph screen
2009-07-04T07:27:00.000Z	djzn	ehazlett	Not updating initrd symbolic links since we are being updated/reinstalled
2009-07-04T07:27:00.000Z	djzn		(2.6.28-13.45 was configured last, according to dpkg)
2009-07-04T07:28:00.000Z	ehazlett	djzn	the only other thing i can recommend it to reinstall the package with apt-get install --reinstall to get the configuration...
2009-07-04T07:29:00.000Z	djzn		already done that
2009-07-04T07:29:00.000Z	djzn		it won't bring that screen back
2009-07-04T07:29:00.000Z	ehazlett	djzn	did you remove the package?
2009-07-04T07:29:00.000Z	djzn	ehazlett	no i didn't.. should I?
2009-07-04T07:29:00.000Z	ehazlett	djzn	that might do it
2009-07-04T07:29:00.000Z	djzn	ehazlett	i will try
