2008-06-15T09:48:00.000Z	owen1		i am going to install debian on a new partition. will i be able to access the files on the old partition (ubuntu)?
2008-06-15T09:49:00.000Z	owen1		going to create a new partition. do i need to defrag or something similar?
2008-06-15T09:50:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	owen1	under windows, it would probably be a good idea
2008-06-15T09:50:00.000Z	owen1	IndyGunFreak	so in ubuntu, all i need to do is insert the live cd to create a partition?
2008-06-15T09:51:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	owen1	yes, but it might be wise to defrag under windows, then install, is what i'm saying
2008-06-15T09:51:00.000Z	owen1	IndyGunFreak	i have no win..
2008-06-15T09:52:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	owen1	then don't worry about it, partition and install
2008-06-15T09:53:00.000Z	owen1	IndyGunFreak	do i need to install grub on the new partition?
2008-06-15T09:54:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	owen1	grub will install automatically at the end of the install
2008-06-15T09:54:00.000Z	owen1	IndyGunFreak	so will i have 2 grubs? one for ubuntu and one for debian?
2008-06-15T09:54:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	owen1	no, it will overwrite the old one
2008-06-15T09:55:00.000Z	owen1	IndyGunFreak	so it will recognize that i have ubuntu. got it.
2008-06-15T09:55:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	owen1	it should
2008-06-15T09:59:00.000Z	owen1	IndyGunFreak	you are here as well..
2008-06-15T09:59:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	owen1	not much longer... why do you mention that
2008-06-15T10:00:00.000Z	owen1	IndyGunFreak	sorry. i thought u r also in #debian...
2008-06-15T10:00:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	owen1	i go to #debian on occasion(because i use it), but i find the people there.. well, less than desirable to be around...
2008-06-15T10:01:00.000Z	owen1	IndyGunFreak	so true!! i want to try debian and was amazed by the attitude there!
2008-06-15T10:01:00.000Z	owen1	IndyGunFreak	not welcoming new immigrants.
