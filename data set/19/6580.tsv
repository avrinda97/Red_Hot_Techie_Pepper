2011-05-04T21:12:00.000Z	MitchM		I'm looking to get the latest PHP version of software (including mod_php) for Ubtunu 8.04LTS, can someone recommend a path/action I need to take to do this?
2011-05-04T21:13:00.000Z	odinsbane	MitchM	you might be able to build it.
2011-05-04T21:13:00.000Z	MitchM	odinsbane	is that recommended?
2011-05-04T21:14:00.000Z	odinsbane	MitchM	I think recommended would be to use a supported version of ubuntu.
2011-05-04T21:14:00.000Z	MitchM	odinsbane	8.04 is LTS, is it no longer supported?
2011-05-04T21:15:00.000Z	odinsbane	MitchM	my mistake.  Is there a backports for newer php?
2011-05-04T21:17:00.000Z	odinsbane	MitchM	how new of php do you need.
2011-05-04T21:18:00.000Z	MitchM	odinsbane	5.3
2011-05-04T21:19:00.000Z	MitchM		What is the "codename" of 8.04LTS ?
2011-05-04T21:19:00.000Z	odinsbane	MitchM	hardy?
2011-05-04T21:20:00.000Z	MitchM		thanks :)
2011-05-04T21:24:00.000Z	odinsbane	MitchM	you might be able to get away with d/loading the .deb's and installing from those.  http://snippets.notmyidea.org/2009/12/13/install-php-5-3-apache-on-ubuntu-9-10-using-dotdeb-repositories-via-apt-get/
2011-05-04T21:26:00.000Z	MitchM	odinsbane	i'll give it a try thanks
2011-05-04T21:26:00.000Z	MitchM		:)
2011-05-04T21:27:00.000Z	odinsbane	MitchM	dpkg will give you dependancy errors before it installs so it shouldn't be too risky.
2011-05-04T21:27:00.000Z	MitchM	odinsbane	yeah - failed, lots of lib* dependecies
2011-05-04T21:29:00.000Z	odinsbane	MitchM	did you try the link, and add the debian repo stable?
2011-05-04T21:30:00.000Z	odinsbane	MitchM	It could be possible to build it even if you can't get a package to work, but probably the reason there isn't the package is because there isn't the dependancy.
2011-05-04T21:32:00.000Z	odinsbane	MitchM	this page seems to be more closely related. http://serverfault.com/questions/36040/installing-php-5-3-on-ubuntu-server
