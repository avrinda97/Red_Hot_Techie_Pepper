2006-07-20T09:13:00.000Z	ic56		which packages do I install to get additional human languages, like French?
2006-07-20T09:15:00.000Z	siennalizard	ic56	sudo apt-get install language-pack-fr
2006-07-20T09:15:00.000Z	ic56	siennalizard	thanks!
2006-07-20T09:18:00.000Z	ic56	siennalizard	and fyrestrtr: do these packages enable data entry in the corresponding language or just display of error messages in that language?
2006-07-20T09:18:00.000Z	siennalizard	ic56	you can always change the keyboard layout, if that's what you mean.
2006-07-20T09:18:00.000Z	ic56	siennalizard	and fyrestrtr: yes, that is what I want.  How do I do that?

2006-07-20T09:19:00.000Z	ic56	siennalizard	and fyrestrtr: (change keyboard layout to another language and enable display of foreign characters)
2006-07-20T09:20:00.000Z	ic56	siennalizard	and fyrestrtr:
2006-07-20T09:20:00.000Z	ic56	siennalizard	and fyrestrtr: aha! thank you both again!
2006-07-20T09:20:00.000Z	siennalizard	ic56	you're welcome
2006-07-20T09:45:00.000Z	siennalizard	ic56	You can add the switcher to your panel.
2006-07-20T09:45:00.000Z	siennalizard	ic56	right click on the panel and say "add to panel"
2006-07-20T09:51:00.000Z	ic56	siennalizard	fyrestrtr: thank you again!  I found a thing called "keyboard indicator" (no switcher) and added that to the panel.  Sure enough, I can right click it and change the setting.  Yet, despite my doing that, when I type in vi in gnome-terminal, the text displayed is still English.  What else do I need to do to type in French?
2006-07-20T09:51:00.000Z	siennalizard	ic56	that's the one.
2006-07-20T09:52:00.000Z	siennalizard	ic56	try opening a new terminal once you've changed that setting.
2006-07-20T09:56:00.000Z	ic56	siennalizard	fyrestrtr: trying variations of your suggestions.  The ideal solution would be a keystroke to switch back and forth since I need to type commands, like "vi" and "ls" in English but, once inside vi, I'll want to type in french.
