2005-04-13T09:34:00.000Z	Lin		hi all!
2005-04-13T09:35:00.000Z	Lin		I have updated my ubuntu hoary and now, nvidia drivers didn't are compatible (X and Kernel) there is already a kernel/X compatible driver, or I will have to compile by myself?
2005-04-13T09:36:00.000Z	Lin		Error: API mismatch: the NVIDIA kernel module is version 7.1.0, but this X module is version 1.0.7167. Please be sure that your
2005-04-13T09:36:00.000Z	Lin		kernel module and all NVIDIA driver files have the same driver version.
2005-04-13T09:36:00.000Z	Fackamato	Lin	tried apt-get remove:ing them and then installing them again? If that doesn't help, I suggest you remove all the nvidia packages and compile manually (very easy)
2005-04-13T09:37:00.000Z	Lin	Fackamato	I know that is very easy (to us programmers/admins) but ubuntu should be user friendly ;-D
2005-04-13T09:37:00.000Z	Fackamato	Lin	:)
2005-04-13T09:37:00.000Z	Lin	Fackamato	Am I wrong?
2005-04-13T09:38:00.000Z	Fackamato	Lin	well, define "user friendly", if by user friendly you mean "everything should be GUI" then I disagree ;p
2005-04-13T09:44:00.000Z	Fackamato	Lin	nah, I'm 18 years old, and I consider myself a normal user. :-p
2005-04-13T09:44:00.000Z	Lin	Fackamato	You're in a ubuntu channel in freenode you not a normal company ready user.
2005-04-13T09:45:00.000Z	Fackamato	Lin	ubuntu is not aimed for the dumb user. :)
2005-04-13T09:45:00.000Z	Lin	Fackamato	I don't think so.
2005-04-13T09:45:00.000Z	Lin	Fackamato	Ubuntu is aimed for companies and end users
2005-04-13T09:46:00.000Z	Lin	Fackamato	those are dumb users ;-D
2005-04-13T09:46:00.000Z	Fackamato	Lin	anyone not reading a readme is begging for problems, no matter the dumbness of the person. :>
2005-04-13T09:47:00.000Z	Lin	Fackamato	I really know it. But in a company we have a kind of users that turn off the printer and ask to you: Why my printer isn't working today
2005-04-13T09:47:00.000Z	Fackamato	Lin	then those companies perhaps use dell computers, and if so, just have a guy install ubuntu and all software on one of them, ghost that, and ghost the other computers, done ;>
2005-04-13T09:48:00.000Z	Lin	Fackamato	Yes, this is true..
