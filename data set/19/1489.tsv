2011-07-08T08:33:00.000Z	cliff		Does anyone know of a way to keep windows from being on more than one viewport at a time if dragged offscreen?
2011-07-08T08:34:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	cliff	nvidia?
2011-07-08T08:35:00.000Z	cliff	kroq-gar78	is there a way in compiz config?
2011-07-08T08:35:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	cliff	do you have proprietary drivers or what? if you do, go to the add hardware program and check (it says there)
2011-07-08T08:36:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	cliff	it's under System->Add Hardware (or something similar)
2011-07-08T08:37:00.000Z	cliff	kroq-gar78	in 11.04?
2011-07-08T08:37:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	cliff	in 11.04 just open up dash and search hardware
2011-07-08T08:38:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	cliff	or not... drivers maybe? type "drivers" in the dash
2011-07-08T08:38:00.000Z	cliff	kroq-gar78	under additional drivers it says I'm not using proprietary drivers
2011-07-08T08:39:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	cliff	then i can't help (sorry). I guess you can play around with compiz config
2011-07-08T08:40:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	cliff	if you don't have compiz config already, do "sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager" in the commandline
2011-07-08T08:40:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	cliff	do you want a window to span multpile or no?
2011-07-08T08:41:00.000Z	cliff	kroq-gar78	I do not. Sometimes I'll drag a window around and it will accidentally be on another workspace so when I switch to the new workspace there will be like a tenth of a window hanging over on the screen and I'll have to change back to the other workspace and resize it. It's annoying.
2011-07-08T08:42:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	cliff	lemme open ccsm
2011-07-08T08:46:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	cliff	look somewhere in "window management" in ccsm
2011-07-08T08:47:00.000Z	cliff	kroq-gar78	what's the difference between put and viewport switcher?
2011-07-08T08:48:00.000Z	cliff	kroq-gar78	I mean the 'put' category in window management and 'viewport switcher' in desktop
2011-07-08T08:48:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	cliff	lemme see... not an expert (or even close to) in compiz, but I can see
2011-07-08T08:50:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	cliff	I think switcher is the actual SWITCHING vs. place is putting it in a certain spot
