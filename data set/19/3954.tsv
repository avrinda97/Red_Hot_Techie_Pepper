2009-12-15T02:16:00.000Z	VCoolio		does anyone happen to know how to compile byobu (the old screen-profiles)? there is no configure file
2009-12-15T02:17:00.000Z	guntbert	VCoolio	its in the repos
2009-12-15T02:17:00.000Z	VCoolio	guntbert	I know, but I want the newest from their own repo because a bug I filed was fixed
2009-12-15T02:19:00.000Z	guntbert	VCoolio	byobu is (on my system) just a /usr/bin/byobu: POSIX shell script text executable
2009-12-15T02:21:00.000Z	guntbert	VCoolio	thats what I would do
2010-01-03T00:47:00.000Z	guntbert	VCoolio	did you look into F2 (setup)?
2010-03-07T23:40:00.000Z	guntbert	VCoolio	thx for stepping in  :-)
2010-03-07T23:46:00.000Z	guntbert	VCoolio	maybe without -R ?
2010-03-07T23:46:00.000Z	VCoolio	guntbert	maybe, but what will happen if the torrents create dirs there?
2010-03-07T23:47:00.000Z	VCoolio	guntbert	I rather think it's not possible to own stuff as user in a root group
2010-03-07T23:49:00.000Z	guntbert	VCoolio	I assumed the folder was empty right now
2010-09-29T01:14:00.000Z	guntbert	VCoolio	you said: "find out what process is behind it..." -- how can you do that?
2010-09-29T01:15:00.000Z	VCoolio	guntbert	something like ps -ef | grep update/apt/notifier whatever, or maybe xprop knows something
2010-09-29T01:15:00.000Z	VCoolio	guntbert	I have e17, it has an option to see what process is behind the window, very convenient
2010-09-29T01:15:00.000Z	guntbert	VCoolio	e17?
2010-09-29T01:16:00.000Z	VCoolio	guntbert	enlightenment, you know, the awesome window manager that has released alpha after ten years
2010-09-29T01:16:00.000Z	guntbert	VCoolio	:-)
2010-09-29T01:25:00.000Z	guntbert	VCoolio	thx for the hint about xprop - just what I asked for :-)
2011-06-28T00:37:00.000Z	guntbert	VCoolio	its just opposed to "server"
