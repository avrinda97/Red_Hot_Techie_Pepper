2008-12-23T13:36:00.000Z	ikonia	node357	if you ask a question
2008-12-23T13:37:00.000Z	ikonia	node357	which development files ?
2008-12-23T13:37:00.000Z	node357	ikonia	I have to build wine 1.1.11 and I get: configure: error: X development files not found. Wine will be built
2008-12-23T13:38:00.000Z	ikonia	node357	why do you need to build wine, it's in the repos
2008-12-23T13:38:00.000Z	ikonia	node357	use the version that is packaged for you in the repo's unless you knw what you are doing
2008-12-23T13:38:00.000Z	node357	ikonia	the people in w#winehq said I need to because 1.0.1 isn't working
2008-12-23T13:41:00.000Z	ikonia	node357	what are you trying to do ?
2008-12-23T13:41:00.000Z	node357	ikonia	trying to run a Windows game that used to work with WINE on a fresh install of Ubuntu 8.10
2008-12-23T13:41:00.000Z	node357	ikonia	it worked fine last time, same installer too
2008-12-23T13:41:00.000Z	ikonia	node357	as in what is causing you the problem that makes you think you need to rebuild wine
2008-12-23T13:41:00.000Z	node357	ikonia	I already told you... people in #winehq said I needed to install the latest version
2008-12-23T13:41:00.000Z	node357	ikonia	and I need X11 devel files to do it but I can't find them
2008-12-23T13:42:00.000Z	ikonia	node357	I'm asking you what the problem is with using the current version
2008-12-23T13:42:00.000Z	node357	ikonia	the Steam.exe will not start, itjust hangs in terminal with no messages
2008-12-23T13:43:00.000Z	ikonia	node357	just reading some bug reports
2008-12-23T13:48:00.000Z	ikonia	node357	so it appears there are a few bugs logged against wine 1.01 and steam, what I'd suggest you do is log this bug on launchpad.net (ubuntu bug system) and quote this page http://www.linux-gamers.net/modules/wiwimod/index.php?page=HOWTO Steam as an extenral source for the bug
2008-12-23T13:48:00.000Z	node357	ikonia	"This page doesn't exist yet."
