2008-04-04T07:34:00.000Z	pingu	troxor	thanks and can i rely on you for im doing some stuff with ndiswrapper because the drivers for my card in linux suck and its kinda uncharted territory for me
2008-04-04T07:36:00.000Z	troxor	pingu	sure, ndiswrapper is a common obstacle- there's a plethora of info out there about it too
2008-04-04T07:37:00.000Z	pingu	troxor	i have the basic info but i still consider myself a bit of a noob at ubuntu
2008-04-04T07:39:00.000Z	pingu	troxor	this is the web page im using and im stuck with the third groups of commands http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=31926
2008-04-04T07:40:00.000Z	troxor	pingu	that's a pretty outdated guide, one sec

2008-04-04T07:40:00.000Z	troxor	pingu	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/Ndiswrapper
2008-04-04T07:42:00.000Z	pingu	troxor	is there a walk through on this i would filter through all of it but i would rather not if you know exactly where it is
2008-04-04T07:45:00.000Z	pingu	troxor	hey whats the command to figure out what i am running i.e. AMD 64 i think i am but not sure
2008-04-04T07:45:00.000Z	troxor	pingu	uname -a
2008-04-04T07:47:00.000Z	pingu	troxor	this is what it gives me "Linux michael-laptop 2.6.22-14-generic #1 SMP Tue Feb 12 07:42:25 UTC 2008 i686 GNU/Linux
2008-04-04T07:47:00.000Z	troxor	pingu	that's a 32-bit kernel
2008-04-04T07:47:00.000Z	pingu	troxor	how do you know?
2008-04-04T07:48:00.000Z	pingu	troxor	i guess just something you know
2008-04-04T07:49:00.000Z	troxor	pingu	it would say x86_64 if it was a 64-bit kernel
2008-04-04T07:49:00.000Z	pingu	troxor	you know more than i do
