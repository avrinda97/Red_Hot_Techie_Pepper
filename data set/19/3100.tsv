2010-01-24T03:45:00.000Z	arand	meowbuntu	I know that some manufacturers supply boot disks which can re-allocate the bad sectors so thaey won't interfere, last time I tried one this involved reformatting the whole disk though... So depends on whether or not that is worth the hassle of reinstalling everything...
2010-01-24T03:46:00.000Z	meowbuntu	arand	its a spare hdd. what is teh software you are refering to
2010-01-24T03:47:00.000Z	arand	meowbuntu	depending on the manufacturer of the disk, look at the their webpage for any utility/tools they might supply.
2010-02-03T15:51:00.000Z	arand	meowbuntu	"aptitude search name"
2010-02-03T15:51:00.000Z	meowbuntu	arand	would apt-get search name work too
2010-02-03T15:52:00.000Z	arand	meowbuntu	nope â†‘ as pointed out you need apt-cache.
2010-02-19T04:29:00.000Z	arand	meowbuntu	what i would do is skip swap completely, and live with inability to hibernate.
2010-02-19T04:31:00.000Z	arand	meowbuntu	still 4GB will fill up if you install a few things, so you'll always have to keep an eye on it..
2010-04-29T06:47:00.000Z	arand	meowbuntu	It's three years from release if I recall correctly.
2010-04-29T06:47:00.000Z	meowbuntu	arand	and that is
2010-04-29T06:48:00.000Z	meowbuntu	arand	i know its 3 yrs for desktop and 5 yes for server
2010-04-29T06:48:00.000Z	arand	meowbuntu	8.04 + 3.0 = 11.04 if my arithmetic serves me right...
