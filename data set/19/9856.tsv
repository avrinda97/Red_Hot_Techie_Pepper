2006-12-28T14:34:00.000Z	superkirbyartist		Ekiga is always saying "Registration failed: Forbidden" when I login!
2006-12-28T14:35:00.000Z	superkirbyartist		Can someone help me please?  I would like to use my Gizmo account!
2006-12-28T14:36:00.000Z	superkirbyartist		Anyone?
2006-12-28T14:37:00.000Z	Scunizi	superkirbyartist	what's not working.. You can't log in?
2006-12-28T14:37:00.000Z	superkirbyartist	Scunizi	Yes.
2006-12-28T14:38:00.000Z	superkirbyartist	Scunizi	It says registration failed.
2006-12-28T14:39:00.000Z	Scunizi	superkirbyartist	hang on let me check my gizmo config.
2006-12-28T14:41:00.000Z	Scunizi	superkirbyartist	 Did you already register on their site?  If so your user name and password are case sensitive.
2006-12-28T14:42:00.000Z	Scunizi	superkirbyartist	 Is it working now?
2007-07-22T05:01:00.000Z	Scunizi	superkirbyartist	when recording or playing back?
2007-07-22T05:02:00.000Z	superkirbyartist	Scunizi	No, simply increasing the volume of an already-written file.
2007-07-22T05:03:00.000Z	Scunizi	superkirbyartist	if the volume controls in Audacity are already turned up all the way you will want to look at the master volume. You could also right click the master volume of the system and choose "Open Volume cont." Play with the slides there.
2007-07-22T05:04:00.000Z	superkirbyartist	Scunizi	if I increase the Gain, will it do anything?
2007-07-22T05:04:00.000Z	Scunizi	superkirbyartist	or were you really asking how to increase the imbedded volume level of the file.?
2007-07-22T05:05:00.000Z	superkirbyartist	Scunizi	yes.
2007-07-22T05:05:00.000Z	Scunizi	superkirbyartist	hang on a sec..
2007-07-22T05:09:00.000Z	Scunizi	superkirbyartist	glad your back... choose "edit" + "select all" then "Effect" + "Amplify".  That will allow you to increase the db of the track
2007-07-22T05:13:00.000Z	superkirbyartist	Scunizi	Amplify doesn't make it louder.
2007-07-22T05:14:00.000Z	Scunizi	superkirbyartist	it should increase the db gain of the track.  Beyond that I'm stumped.. works for me.
