2008-12-09T17:59:00.000Z	peleg	jrib	indeed
2008-12-09T17:47:00.000Z	jrib	peleg	try a live cd and see if it "just works"
2008-12-09T17:52:00.000Z	peleg	jrib	thanks, I think I might will. Will it really imitate well how it'll work with a new installation?
2008-12-09T17:52:00.000Z	jrib	peleg	of course, it's just like an install
2008-12-09T17:52:00.000Z	peleg	jrib	thanks.
2008-12-09T17:53:00.000Z	jrib	peleg	I'd try both 8.04 (support for 3 years on the desktop) and 8.10 (support for 18 months, but newer).
2008-12-09T17:54:00.000Z	peleg	jrib	what should I backup before installation?
2008-12-09T17:54:00.000Z	jrib	peleg	anything you should already have backups for: data you care about
2008-12-09T17:54:00.000Z	peleg	jrib	but what about all of the stuff in .Gnome and .irssi and etc... will it be preserved? will it survive the upgrade?
2008-12-09T17:55:00.000Z	jrib	peleg	yes, all your settings are supposed to stay there, so barring some catastrophic failure, you are fine
2008-12-09T17:57:00.000Z	peleg	jrib	ok, thanks. Do you have any estimation how much time should it take? I can take a day off now, so if the whole process will take no more than 6 hours, I think I'll go for it (I assume people here will try to help me if I'm stuck, right? ;-) )
2008-12-09T17:58:00.000Z	jrib	peleg	are you upgrading from 7.04?
2008-12-09T18:01:00.000Z	jrib	peleg	you'll need to upgrade through 7.10 first, then 8.04, then 8.10 (as far as you want to go since all of these are supported, however 7.10 support ends in april).  Each upgrade will probably take "a couple" of hours (it depends on how much you have installed).  If you just want to upgrade to 7.10, I'd say you have plenty of time.  Depending on how much time that takes, you can then gauge if you have
2008-12-09T18:02:00.000Z	peleg	jrib	oh, cool, thanks! I'll start with 7.10 then
2008-12-09T18:10:00.000Z	peleg	jrib	do you have any idea how will I get gnomebaker or some other burning application with no active mirrors? do you know of a binary of gnomebaker somewhere?
2008-12-09T18:11:00.000Z	jrib	peleg	old-releases.ubuntu.com until you upgrade
2008-12-09T18:11:00.000Z	peleg	jrib	thanks!
2008-12-09T18:12:00.000Z	peleg	jrib	something like "deb http://old-releases.ubuntu.com feisty main universe" ?
2008-12-09T18:13:00.000Z	jrib	peleg	almost.  Look at the current url you use
