2009-03-31T10:29:00.000Z	ron2010		any suggestions???
2009-03-31T10:29:00.000Z	lockd	ron2010	does that default to HID mode? not quite sure
2009-03-31T10:29:00.000Z	ron2010	lockd	i'
2009-03-31T10:31:00.000Z	lockd	ron2010	dmesg | grep Bluetooth ... pastebin that
2009-03-31T10:31:00.000Z	lockd	ron2010	hmm, I think that is HCI mode, which I doubt works with mice
2009-03-31T10:32:00.000Z	lockd	ron2010	oh, then you will probably have to revert the packages
2009-03-31T10:33:00.000Z	lockd	ron2010	things break a lot in unstable
2009-03-31T10:34:00.000Z	lockd	ron2010	is it just not working, or is bluetoothd crashing left and right?
2009-03-31T10:35:00.000Z	lockd	ron2010	have you tried something like this: http://idebian.wordpress.com/2008/07/06/manage-hid-bluetooth-devices-in-linux/
2009-03-31T10:36:00.000Z	lockd	ron2010	the red pill instructions, that is. or let me see if I can find the HID/HCI switcher
2009-03-31T10:38:00.000Z	lockd	ron2010	try hid2hci
2009-03-31T10:40:00.000Z	lockd	ron2010	hid2hci --tohid
2009-03-31T10:41:00.000Z	lockd	ron2010	what happens when you type hid2hci --tohid
2009-03-31T10:43:00.000Z	lockd	ron2010	try sudo
2009-03-31T10:45:00.000Z	lockd	ron2010	HID mode simplifies the interface, making it appear as a standard USB keyboard or mouse
2009-03-31T10:45:00.000Z	lockd	ron2010	maybe that dongle doesn't have that support, though
