2011-12-31T03:39:00.000Z	Kiten	munzxttt	so you want to update 10.04 to 11.04 ?
2011-12-31T03:40:00.000Z	munzxttt	Kiten	: sorry :0
2011-12-31T03:40:00.000Z	munzxttt	Kiten	: no! i just want to update the 'software center'!!!! is it possible?!
2011-12-31T03:40:00.000Z	Kiten		uh well yes and no, you could change the repository that you use
2011-12-31T03:41:00.000Z	Kiten		but this isn't really supported and can break your installation
2011-12-31T03:41:00.000Z	munzxttt	Kiten	: mmm ... i just want to get other users feedback and the ratings !
2011-12-31T03:41:00.000Z	Kiten		???
2011-12-31T03:42:00.000Z	Kiten		you want to get feedback from particular installs ?
2011-12-31T03:42:00.000Z	Kiten		* err packages
2011-12-31T03:43:00.000Z	Kiten		i've not had a chance to look 11.04 over so i'm not sure what you guy's software center looks like
2011-12-31T03:43:00.000Z	munzxttt	Kiten	: yes along with the ratings which is not supported in the older version of the 'software center'
2011-12-31T03:44:00.000Z	Kiten		ahh well updating the software center isn't actually supported in other words you'd be better off updating to 11.04
2011-12-31T03:44:00.000Z	munzxttt	Kiten	: thanks for your help ... :)
2011-12-31T03:44:00.000Z	munzxttt	Kiten	: bye
