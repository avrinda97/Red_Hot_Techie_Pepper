2005-12-15T09:08:00.000Z	tristan		could someone briefly direct me to an ubuntu repository discussion?
2005-12-15T09:09:00.000Z	tristan		I have the breezy universe repositories in my sources.list, but I still can't install some packages that tell me they need the universe repository
2005-12-15T09:09:00.000Z	brenner	tristan	have you updated?
2005-12-15T09:17:00.000Z	brenner	tristan	it's in universe.  have you updated?
2005-12-15T09:24:00.000Z	brenner	tristan	you running breezy?
2006-01-23T07:24:00.000Z	brenner	tristan	you could probably help us out more by pasting the exact error wording
2006-01-23T09:54:00.000Z	brenner	tristan	is this you error? http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=117037&highlight=gnome_segv
2006-01-23T09:56:00.000Z	tristan	brenner	: exactly that's what is written
2006-01-23T09:56:00.000Z	brenner	tristan	try the dist-upgrade as suggested
2006-01-23T09:56:00.000Z	tristan	brenner	: this is not a new install
2006-01-23T09:57:00.000Z	brenner	tristan	can you think of anything that might have caused it?
2006-01-23T09:57:00.000Z	tristan	brenner	: yes I had to shut down the computer by pressing 10 seconds the power button because the computer froze
2006-01-23T09:58:00.000Z	brenner	tristan	what caused the freeze?
2006-01-23T09:58:00.000Z	tristan	brenner	: seems it was firefox
2006-01-23T09:59:00.000Z	brenner	tristan	i don't know to be honest.  one app freeze shouldn't cause entire system failure
2006-01-23T10:00:00.000Z	brenner	tristan	good luck
2006-01-23T10:00:00.000Z	tristan	brenner	: thanks I need it
2006-01-23T10:02:00.000Z	tristan	brenner	: OK. I'm rebooting. I hope it will finally work. I don't want to use kde....
2006-01-23T10:02:00.000Z	brenner	tristan	good luck again
