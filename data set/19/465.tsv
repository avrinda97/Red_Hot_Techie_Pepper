2012-02-27T00:28:00.000Z	Halexander9000		Hey, whenever I run the Update Manager and tell it to check for updates, I get this error http://pastebin.com/w5bfbG1N
2012-02-27T00:28:00.000Z	Halexander9000		Can I solve it somehow?
2012-02-27T00:28:00.000Z	Halexander9000		Could someone please tell me how to do it?
2012-02-27T00:30:00.000Z	Oer	Halexander9000	i never seen the entry's with www.statux.org/
2012-02-27T00:33:00.000Z	Oer	Halexander9000	please paste your sources list >> /etc/apt/sources.list
2012-02-27T00:36:00.000Z	Oer	Halexander9000	oke here is the solution
2012-02-27T00:38:00.000Z	Oer	Halexander9000	all you need is to get the pgp key >>" wget -q http://www.statux.org/ubuntu/key/statux.pub -O- | sudo apt-key add - " found at answer #3 >> http://vip.asus.com/forum/view.aspx?id=20091110101016812&SLanguage=en-us&board_id=20&model=Eee%20PC%201005HA&page=1
2012-02-27T00:39:00.000Z	Halexander9000	Oer	you're going to have to be a little more clear. You're saying I just need to type this " wget -q http://www.statux.org/ubuntu/key/statux.pub -O- | sudo apt-key add - " in terminal and it will solve the issue?
2012-02-27T00:40:00.000Z	Oer	Halexander9000	correct, then you perform update && upgrade
2012-02-27T00:41:00.000Z	Halexander9000	Oer	Is it supposed to freeze?
2012-02-27T00:41:00.000Z	Oer	Halexander9000	yes, getting a key can take 10 sec
2012-02-27T00:41:00.000Z	Halexander9000	Oer	gpg: no valid OpenPGP data found.
2012-02-27T00:42:00.000Z	Oer	Halexander9000	maybe the archiv is out of date, if found only old posts.
2012-02-27T00:43:00.000Z	Halexander9000	Oer	can I remove the conflicting entries then?
2012-02-27T00:44:00.000Z	Oer	Halexander9000	yes, use sudo gedit  /etc/apt/sources.list
2012-02-27T00:46:00.000Z	Oer	Halexander9000	see the end, remove the last 2 entries.
2012-02-27T00:48:00.000Z	Halexander9000	Oer	Problem Solved.
2012-02-27T00:49:00.000Z	Oer	Halexander9000	have fun
