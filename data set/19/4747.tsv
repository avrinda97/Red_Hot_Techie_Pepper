2008-11-11T21:57:00.000Z	Dominik314	Slart	I don't have ssh setup on either mashine
2008-11-11T21:59:00.000Z	Dominik314		slart: my system is responsive again, given what I described earlier what could it be?
2008-11-11T22:00:00.000Z	Slart	Dominik314	something using your harddrive is my guess.. perhaps the trackerd, file indexing thingy
2008-11-11T22:02:00.000Z	Dominik314	Slart	how can I disable those things
2008-11-11T22:04:00.000Z	Slart	Dominik314	you can disable the trackerd service in system, administration, services I think
2008-11-11T22:05:00.000Z	Dominik314	Slart	thanks
2008-11-11T22:06:00.000Z	Dominik314		slart: didn't see any tracking service
2008-11-11T22:08:00.000Z	Slart	Dominik314	hmm.. you're right.. well, it's got an icon in the tasktray.. a magnifying glass.. right click on it for options
2008-11-11T22:08:00.000Z	Dominik314	Slart	don't have it
2008-11-11T22:09:00.000Z	Slart	Dominik314	then it must be something else
2008-11-11T22:12:00.000Z	Dominik314		slart: I am trying to remove evolution on the trouble machine at this moment, and it is hanging again with the same symptoms, 0% CPU 100% IOWait, 100% mem, 10 % swap, full load, hdd read 50%
2008-11-11T22:12:00.000Z	Dominik314		slart: the system clock has been stuck since 12:07 that was 5 min ago
2008-11-11T22:13:00.000Z	Slart	Dominik314	sounds like something is broken
2008-11-11T22:14:00.000Z	Dominik314	Slart	: ( reinstall?
2008-11-11T22:14:00.000Z	Slart	Dominik314	might be the easiest solution =/
2008-11-11T22:14:00.000Z	Dominik314	Slart	how will I accomplish this given im dual booting xp?
2008-11-11T22:15:00.000Z	Slart	Dominik314	reinstalling ubuntu wont affect your dualbooting afaik
2008-11-11T22:15:00.000Z	Dominik314		well, lets tend to the troubles of my other PC running ubuntu: when I scroll it is very laggy and utilizes 100% CPU, this makes me feel my dedicated graphics card is not working
2008-11-11T22:15:00.000Z	Dominik314	Slart	k ill give it a shot
