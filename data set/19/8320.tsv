2008-02-21T08:16:00.000Z	macogw	soulburner	gkrellm?
2008-02-21T08:16:00.000Z	macogw	soulburner	thats what i use
2008-02-21T08:16:00.000Z	soulburner	macogw	gkrellm?
2008-02-21T08:17:00.000Z	macogw	soulburner	yes, thats what i use.  as far as transparent goes though...do you want something like the widgets on the OSX Dashboard?  Screenlets is the closest thing to that
2008-02-21T08:18:00.000Z	soulburner	macogw	conky can be visable on the desktop at all times yes?
2008-02-21T08:18:00.000Z	macogw	soulburner	conky sort of stays embedded in your desktop...so it looks like its right on the wallpaper
2008-02-21T08:22:00.000Z	macogw	soulburner	dont know, but id suggest checking ubuntuforums.org for sample configuration files
2008-02-21T08:27:00.000Z	macogw	soulburner	if you type: nohup <command> &
2008-02-21T08:27:00.000Z	macogw	soulburner	you can close the terminal then
2008-02-21T08:28:00.000Z	macogw	soulburner	nohup means "no hang up" so when you close the terminal it doesnt close the program, and the & backgrounds the task so you get back to a prompt and can close the terminal
2008-02-21T08:29:00.000Z	macogw	soulburner	np  that's something even a lot of experienced users probably dont know about... one of the other UF mods was all "omg seriously??" when i told him that on the phone :p
2008-02-21T08:31:00.000Z	macogw	soulburner	~/.conkyrc
2008-02-21T08:31:00.000Z	macogw	soulburner	~ means your home directory, and . makes the file hidden
2008-02-21T08:31:00.000Z	macogw	soulburner	check on ubuntuforums.  there's a thread called something like "show us your conkyrc" and so its full of screenshots with config files
2008-02-21T08:43:00.000Z	macogw	soulburner	i dont know. i dont use conky, i use gkrellm
