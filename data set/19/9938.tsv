2006-08-24T10:24:00.000Z	_relachs		can somebody please answer me? :-[
2006-08-24T10:25:00.000Z	AstralJava	_relachs	Sorry, missed your question, could you repeat it please?
2006-08-24T10:26:00.000Z	_relachs		(18:16:40) _relachs: I'm trying to set up my ati card, it says that i have to change the identifier to "aticonfig-Screen[0] " in section Screen... But there are 2 Screen sections, 1 of them has the Id
2006-08-24T10:27:00.000Z	AstralJava	_relachs	Hmm... I dunno really, either one of them probably includes settings that you'd want, but lemme find you a wiki page that covers ati install, okay?
2006-08-24T10:27:00.000Z	_relachs	AstralJava	I am on the official installation wiki
2006-08-24T10:29:00.000Z	AstralJava	_relachs	I see, just found the page and noticed the problem. :)
2006-08-24T10:29:00.000Z	_relachs		It says i have to change the Identifier to "aticonfig-Screen[0] ", but there are 2 Screen sections, one of them already has the identifier, the other one is named "Default Screen"
2006-08-24T10:29:00.000Z	_relachs		so do i haveo to change def screen to "aticonfig-Screen[0] " ?
2006-08-24T10:30:00.000Z	AstralJava	_relachs	Could you use say http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/ and paste your xorg.conf there, and mention how you would like your screen to look like, maybe some of us can find the correct screen section there?
2006-08-24T10:33:00.000Z	_relachs	AstralJava	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/21551 But i just would like to have an answer to my question, isnt it simple?
2006-08-24T10:33:00.000Z	AstralJava	_relachs	I'm trying to answer it, to me it isn't simple. :)
2006-08-24T10:34:00.000Z	_relachs	AstralJava	are you kidding me? :)
2006-08-24T10:34:00.000Z	AstralJava	_relachs	Well i don't understand this, one of the screen sections already have that identifier, what's the problem?
2006-08-24T10:35:00.000Z	_relachs	AstralJava	because i did not set it up like this by editing with gedit! It says in teh wiki i have to edit it manuelly to "aticonfig-Screen[0] "
2006-08-24T10:36:00.000Z	_relachs	AstralJava	So my question is: do i have to change Identifier"DefaultScreen" to Identifier"DefaultScreen" to "aticonfig-Screen[0] "
2006-08-24T10:39:00.000Z	_relachs	AstralJava	?
2006-08-24T10:39:00.000Z	AstralJava	_relachs	Well apparently the wiki page is confusing. :)
2006-08-24T10:40:00.000Z	AstralJava	_relachs	You can change the other Screen's identifier to look as intended, and then edit the other so that the identifier's aren't the same. I don't know whether it's needed, since I don't know whether your X looks like you want it to.
2006-08-24T10:43:00.000Z	AstralJava	_relachs	Let's just start with; does X do what you want it to? Cause if it does, there's no need to change anything.
