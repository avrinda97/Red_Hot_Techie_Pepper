2009-12-16T18:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	wishkeep	2nd one (missed a space)
2009-12-16T18:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	wishkeep	if you use network manager or any of that muck, it will overwrite the file when it starts
2009-12-16T18:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	wishkeep	so add the DNS servers to the config of the app, rather than the file
2009-12-16T18:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	wishkeep	do you use network manager or wicd or someting like that?
2009-12-16T18:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	wishkeep	ok, so when that app loads, it will destroy the settings and put in its own
2009-12-16T18:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	wishkeep	so you  need to put the settings you want into network manager
2009-12-16T18:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	wishkeep	i dont use network manager
2009-12-16T18:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	wishkeep	click round, it will be there
2009-12-16T18:35:00.000Z	wishkeep	ActionParsnip1	jeje, thanxs a lot!!!
2009-12-16T18:35:00.000Z	wishkeep	ActionParsnip1	one more thing, jeje
2009-12-16T18:37:00.000Z	wishkeep	ActionParsnip1	if I change de permissions of resolve.conf file to only read.....i will fix it?
2009-12-16T18:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	wishkeep	no it will always be overwritten afaik, you can markit as read only maybe
2009-12-16T18:38:00.000Z	wishkeep	ActionParsnip1	ok thanxs againXD
