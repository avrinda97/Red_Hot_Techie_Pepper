2008-05-25T13:32:00.000Z	cpro		hey there i am gettin an error my laptop is not booting. whenever i boot it gooes in a inbuilt shell called ash with (initramfs) prompt can anybody help
2008-05-25T13:33:00.000Z	Starnestommy	cpro	run "dmesg" and look for errors thta might cause it to not boot
2008-05-25T13:37:00.000Z	Starnestommy	cpro	the output of dmesg is one thing that I could check
2008-05-25T13:40:00.000Z	Starnestommy	cpro	just tell me some of the things that show up in it, specifically hard disk errors
2008-05-25T13:43:00.000Z	Starnestommy	cpro	it looks like that could cause it.  it might be bad ram
2008-05-25T13:44:00.000Z	Starnestommy	cpro	or something in the kernel or initrd image not working
2008-05-25T13:44:00.000Z	Starnestommy	cpro	there might be, but there also might not be a problem with that
2008-05-25T13:45:00.000Z	Starnestommy	cpro	I'm not exactly sure if that's the cause of the problem
2008-05-25T13:45:00.000Z	Starnestommy	cpro	did you recently make any changes to the system?
2008-05-25T13:46:00.000Z	Starnestommy	cpro	a software could also have caused this
2008-05-25T13:47:00.000Z	Starnestommy	cpro	anything in ubuntu, specifically installing, removing, or updating hardware
2008-05-25T13:47:00.000Z	Starnestommy	cpro	er, software, not hardware
2008-05-25T13:48:00.000Z	Starnestommy	cpro	looks like a filesystem error.
2008-05-25T13:49:00.000Z	Starnestommy	cpro	fsck might be able to fix it
2008-05-25T13:50:00.000Z	Starnestommy	cpro	use the livecd to run fsck
2008-05-25T13:51:00.000Z	Starnestommy	cpro	although on that cd it would be "sudo fsck" in a terminal
2008-05-25T13:54:00.000Z	Starnestommy	cpro	are they sata hard drives?
2008-05-25T13:55:00.000Z	Starnestommy	cpro	you might need a disk with the sata drivers on it.  Someone in the channel ##windows should know how to get windows and sata working
2008-05-25T13:56:00.000Z	Starnestommy	cpro	##windows is on this server.  Just type /join ##windows to get to it
