2011-06-11T07:09:00.000Z	lunzie		can anyone help with boot recovery? i'm stuck using a live cd atm
2011-06-11T07:10:00.000Z	[V13]Axel	lunzie	What are you trying to do with boot recovery?
2011-06-11T07:11:00.000Z	lunzie	[V13]Axel	i can only get as far as the command line since gdm fails with ureadahead and dbus errors from missing /var/lib folders/files
2011-06-11T07:12:00.000Z	[V13]Axel	lunzie	Hmm. Is this on the CD or the actual PC's file system.
2011-06-11T07:13:00.000Z	lunzie	[V13]Axel	it's on the harddisk .... where /var is on a separate partition
2011-06-11T07:15:00.000Z	lunzie	[V13]Axel	now i'm stuck using a live cd where i am chrooted into my boot partition ... i can give some pastebin results from that
2011-06-11T07:15:00.000Z	[V13]Axel	lunzie	Well, do you have any idea how it ended up liike that?
2011-06-11T07:16:00.000Z	lunzie	[V13]Axel	afaik, the last thing i did was update my software and my reboot failed since then ... i'm using natty 64-bit with a separated /var partition
2011-06-11T07:17:00.000Z	[V13]Axel	lunzie	Perhaps it's not able to mount the partition of /var?
2011-06-11T07:21:00.000Z	lunzie	[V13]Axel	tru, /var folders cant mount on the filesystem but can using live cd ... except /var/lib turn up empty (which seems to be the culprit, from surfing)
2011-06-11T07:22:00.000Z	lunzie	[V13]Axel	sorry, i'm kinda still a newbie *blush*
2011-06-11T07:22:00.000Z	lunzie	[V13]Axel	i dont have any pastebin for my reboots, but i have a pastebin for chroot activities on live cd: http://pastebin.com/qYAwWwLh
2011-06-11T07:24:00.000Z	[V13]Axel	lunzie	That's all fine-- I had to learn the rules once too. Anyway, I personally am not that in-depth skilled. However, my first thought is to perhaps copy the /var/lib from the CD's File System.
2011-06-11T07:25:00.000Z	lunzie	[V13]Axel	when i chroot to my boot partition sda1 in live cd, the /var partition sda10 automatically mounts as well (but with no /var/lib)
2011-06-11T07:30:00.000Z	lunzie	[V13]Axel	how do i msg more than 1 person at at time on here?
2011-06-11T07:31:00.000Z	[V13]Axel	lunzie	What do you mean, make a chat message that flags more than one user?
2011-06-11T07:31:00.000Z	[V13]Axel	lunzie	In the main channel?
2011-06-11T07:32:00.000Z	lunzie	[V13]Axel	yes, flag more than 1 user with a msg
2011-06-11T07:34:00.000Z	[V13]Axel	lunzie	I'm guessing just separate their names with commas.
