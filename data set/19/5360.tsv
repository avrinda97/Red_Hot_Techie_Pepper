2008-08-17T22:42:00.000Z	gps23		hi
2008-08-17T22:44:00.000Z	gps23		i want to shutdown my system at a specified time, i edited root's crontab and added a line to 'halt' the machine, but its not working
2008-08-17T22:44:00.000Z	unop	gps23	use /etc/crontab instead of root's crontab
2008-08-17T22:45:00.000Z	gps23	unop	thanks, can u please point me to somewhere which tells me 'why?'
2008-08-17T22:46:00.000Z	unop	gps23	well, /etc/crontab is run by root anyway, doesn't make sense for root to have another crontab
2008-08-17T22:46:00.000Z	gps23	unop	just for checking, i added a line to 'mkdir /root/123' in crontab, and after the right time, the folder was created
2008-08-17T22:47:00.000Z	unop	gps23	not sure then .. you could try logging your halt command.  halt >/tmp/halt.log 2>&1
2008-08-17T22:47:00.000Z	gps23	unop	thats good idea, thanks
2008-08-17T22:48:00.000Z	unop	gps23	though i would still recommend using /etc/crontab
2008-08-17T22:48:00.000Z	gps23	unop	i will follow that, but just wanted to check why one command is working and other isn't
2008-08-17T22:50:00.000Z	unop	gps23	perhaps, you might need to set the PATH variable appropriately in the crontab .. specifically to include /sbin/
2008-08-17T22:50:00.000Z	gps23	unop	reason: '/bin/sh: halt: not found'
2008-08-17T22:50:00.000Z	gps23	unop	you are right
2008-08-17T22:50:00.000Z	unop	gps23	yea, see my last post.
2008-08-17T22:51:00.000Z	gps23	unop	yes, its using user's PATH but halt is in sbin
2008-08-17T22:52:00.000Z	unop	gps23	at the beginning of the crontab, this should do.   PATH=$PATH:/sbin
2008-08-17T22:53:00.000Z	gps23	unop	got it, thanks
2008-08-17T22:56:00.000Z	gps23	unop	need to do some refinement, interpolation of $PATH is not being done in PATH=$PATH:/sbin, i added "echo $PATH > /tmp/halt.log 2>&1' in crontab to check and i got $PATH:/sbin as such
2008-08-17T22:57:00.000Z	unop	gps23	hmm strange .. well, better be specific then.
