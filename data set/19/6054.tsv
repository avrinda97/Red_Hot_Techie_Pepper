2008-04-04T18:11:00.000Z	DistroJockey	soundray	but Ubuntu will be smart and support those chips :)
2008-04-04T18:11:00.000Z	soundray	DistroJockey	nope
2008-04-04T18:11:00.000Z	DistroJockey	soundray	ohh?
2008-04-04T18:13:00.000Z	soundray	DistroJockey	my AirPort Extreme card is not supported in gutsy (haven't tried hardy yet)
2008-04-04T18:14:00.000Z	DistroJockey	soundray	They'll get there
2008-07-25T15:51:00.000Z	DistroJockey	soundray	Scorp_ : you would need to add the extra repo's in the Live system
2008-08-19T14:43:00.000Z	DistroJockey	soundray	Rafik : sounds to me like  xorg  doesn't have the setup for the second screen
2008-08-19T14:44:00.000Z	soundray	DistroJockey	indeed. That's what we're trying to fix with xrandr ( Rafik)
2008-08-19T14:45:00.000Z	DistroJockey	soundray	but you used :0 right? Which would be the broken laptop screen?
2008-08-19T14:46:00.000Z	soundray	DistroJockey	I'm assuming that there is one instance of X running, in which case the display number would be :0
2008-08-19T14:46:00.000Z	DistroJockey	soundray	Rafik : yeah, that would be the default (broken) one
2008-08-19T14:47:00.000Z	DistroJockey	soundray	Rafik : I'm assuming the external has never been set up in  xorg.conf
2008-08-19T14:47:00.000Z	soundray	DistroJockey	is there something else one could try, except xrandr --output VGA --auto? He's got the OS ati driver
2008-08-19T14:48:00.000Z	DistroJockey	soundray	I'm not familiar with the xrandr switches.  Does --output VGA mean physical output?
2008-08-19T14:49:00.000Z	soundray	DistroJockey	yes
2008-08-19T14:49:00.000Z	DistroJockey	soundray	ahh. Rafik , no that won't help I don't think
2008-08-19T14:50:00.000Z	DistroJockey	soundray	Rafik : only thing I can think of is adding a  screen  definition in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2008-08-19T14:51:00.000Z	soundray	DistroJockey	I'm very reluctant to fiddle with an apparently working xorg.conf when you can't see the results ( Rafik)
2008-08-19T14:51:00.000Z	DistroJockey	soundray	yeah, true
