2011-04-11T10:31:00.000Z	rww	psypher246	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ReportingBugs does say how to file a bug without using ubuntu-bug.
2011-04-11T10:31:00.000Z	rww	psypher246	in short, use http://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/PACKAGENAME/+filebug?no-redirect , replacing PACKAGENAME with the relevant source package.
2011-04-11T10:32:00.000Z	rww	psypher246	There used to be. It was a pain because people kept using it, filing against the wrong package, and not using ubuntu-bug.
2011-04-11T10:32:00.000Z	psypher246	rww	silly
2011-04-11T10:34:00.000Z	psypher246	rww	that linik u gave me does not work
2011-04-11T10:35:00.000Z	rww	psypher246	works fine for me. Make sure you're replacing PACKAGENAME with a source package name.
2011-04-11T10:36:00.000Z	psypher246	rww	sorry but this is all very silly
2011-04-11T10:37:00.000Z	rww	psypher246	As I said, it used to be set up that way. After the ten thousandth time asking bug reporters for information that's automatically added by ubuntu-bug, the current setup starts looking less silly.
