2005-12-11T07:56:00.000Z	vir		hello
2005-12-11T07:58:00.000Z	vir		I would like it to have the "Open Terminal" entry in the right-click menu of the desktop...how to activate it? there is no such entry..
2005-12-11T07:58:00.000Z	thoreauputic	vir	install nautilus-open-terminal  from memory
2005-12-11T07:59:00.000Z	vir	thoreauputic	thx :)
2005-12-11T08:00:00.000Z	thoreauputic	vir	you're welcome :)
2005-12-11T08:02:00.000Z	vir	thoreauputic	fyi: i had to restart nautilus
2005-12-11T08:02:00.000Z	thoreauputic	vir	yes, that's normal :)
2005-12-11T08:02:00.000Z	thoreauputic	vir	it has to re-read its config
2005-12-11T08:03:00.000Z	vir	thoreauputic	maybe nautilus needs such an option
2005-12-11T08:03:00.000Z	thoreauputic	vir	what option?
2005-12-11T08:04:00.000Z	vir	thoreauputic	"--reread", or "--restart"
2005-12-11T08:04:00.000Z	thoreauputic	vir	it used to exist in hoary - I think the gnome people decided in their wisdom to remove yet another thing ;)
2005-12-11T08:05:00.000Z	thoreauputic	vir	ah I see
2005-12-11T08:17:00.000Z	thoreauputic	vir	 sudo "editor" /boot/grub/menu.lst    :)
2005-12-11T08:18:00.000Z	vir	thoreauputic	what's about the gui configuration? it was really good (gnome 2.10)
2005-12-11T08:18:00.000Z	thoreauputic	vir	in ubuntu? I never saw it ...
2005-12-11T08:22:00.000Z	vir	thoreauputic	well, then this is outdated: http://help.ubuntu.com/starterguide/C/faqguide-all.html#id2521330 , there is no "System->Administration->Boot" in menu
2005-12-11T08:23:00.000Z	thoreauputic	vir	looking
2005-12-11T08:26:00.000Z	thoreauputic	vir	you're right, that seems wrong
