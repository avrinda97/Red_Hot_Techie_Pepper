2010-07-10T01:24:00.000Z	guntbert	DarkStar1	did you warn G_G that "PPAs are unsupported third-party packages, and should be used at your own risk" ?
2010-07-10T01:29:00.000Z	guntbert	DarkStar1	not pish posh - of course they are useful - but everyone who uses one should be aware that there *is* some risk
2010-07-10T01:33:00.000Z	DarkStar1	guntbert	the second we switch on the computer we take risks. Nothing is safe, I however will not recommend something I don't find near faultless.
2010-07-10T01:34:00.000Z	guntbert	DarkStar1	ok ok - I didn't want to make a big issue of that :-) (sorry if it sounded that way)
2010-07-10T01:37:00.000Z	DarkStar1	guntbert	Np dude. An assumption I make (Yes I know assumptions are the mother of all......) is that whoever chooses to run open source has agreed to leave the cotton ball handling of windows and therefore know that choosing to run the system itself involves risks
2010-07-10T01:40:00.000Z	guntbert	DarkStar1	yet there is a distintion between software that was tested and is supported here (the ubuntu repos) and such which comes from essentially untrusted sources - mind you I didn't say "don't recommend ppas" ...
2010-07-10T01:43:00.000Z	DarkStar1	guntbert	That is true. but in this case the ppa I recomemended comes from the Hardware manufacturers themselves. The situation regarding PPA shouldn't be taken in such  Black and white context. I would assume the hardware manufacturers have a vested interest in ensuring the functionality of their hardware
2010-07-10T01:43:00.000Z	guntbert	DarkStar1	ack :-) and lets drop it as it is somewhat off topic meanwhile
2010-07-10T01:44:00.000Z	DarkStar1	guntbert	sorry for dragging it :)
2010-07-10T01:44:00.000Z	guntbert	DarkStar1	:-))
2011-12-22T01:58:00.000Z	guntbert	DarkStar1	have a look at rsync
2011-12-22T01:58:00.000Z	DarkStar1	guntbert	I was going to do that when I got home later. but for now I need something before I have to leave
2011-12-22T01:59:00.000Z	guntbert	DarkStar1	it tis definitely your way to go
2011-12-22T02:00:00.000Z	DarkStar1	guntbert	is it installed by default?
2011-12-22T02:01:00.000Z	guntbert	DarkStar1	it seems so
2012-09-11T20:56:00.000Z	guntbert	DarkStar1	lsb_release -a
2012-10-11T01:24:00.000Z	guntbert	DarkStar1	why "another"? what did you try?
2012-10-11T01:25:00.000Z	guntbert	DarkStar1	it may take a long time
