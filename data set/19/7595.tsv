2007-07-29T07:00:00.000Z	exyan		how do I get limewire working if I can't install java Oo
2007-07-29T07:02:00.000Z	exyan		torrents aren't good for music :)
2007-07-29T07:02:00.000Z	sq89	exyan	any reason why you use 64-bit? many people just switched to 32-bit
2007-07-29T07:03:00.000Z	exyan	sq89	and why should I use 32bit? linux is not windows, linux actually evolves and everything works better with native arch
2007-07-29T07:04:00.000Z	sq89	exyan	actually I've had a better experience with 64-bits windows than with linux :-)
2007-07-29T07:04:00.000Z	sq89	exyan	ubuntu currently doesn't focus on 64-bit. if you want to use that power, maybe gentoo is a better idea. 32-bits ubuntu works great though
2007-07-29T07:05:00.000Z	exyan	sq89	depends what you use, I'm kinda only trying out ubuntu here and it's toooo much X, I mean they don't even want u to go root? lol?
2007-07-29T07:05:00.000Z	exyan	sq89	and yep, I'm from the gentoo crowd :)
2007-07-29T07:06:00.000Z	exyan	sq89	I just don't like the whole new-user friendlyness thing here :/
2007-07-29T07:06:00.000Z	exyan	sq89	that messes a lot of stuff up
2007-07-29T07:06:00.000Z	sq89	exyan	I think many people will disagree, ubuntu is also used by advanced system administrators to run servers on afaik
2007-07-29T07:07:00.000Z	exyan	sq89	I mean, you see all the beautiful kde+beryl stuff, but you have totaly no idea what's under the hood
2007-07-29T07:07:00.000Z	sq89	exyan	why couldn't you have any idea what's under the hood? all man pages are there, and you can read all package sources if you'd want to
2007-07-29T07:10:00.000Z	sq89	exyan	why is that? (I was wondering about using debian myself too, but didn't know why I actually should :-)
2007-07-29T07:10:00.000Z	exyan	sq89	ubuntu is like a fully configured debian with kde/gnome and all the shinny eyecandy imo ;)
2007-07-29T07:11:00.000Z	exyan	sq89	with a fast clean install etc
2007-07-29T07:11:00.000Z	sq89	exyan	and ubuntu's got nice things debian hasn't (afaik), like upstart
