2008-08-05T00:56:00.000Z	nownot	remoteCTRL	already have openvpn but i cant connect to it through my iphone ....
2008-08-05T00:57:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	nownot	keep in mind that openvpn per default keeps you form connecting to the computer it is running on, to access that computer you need to set a variable in the config files
2008-08-05T00:58:00.000Z	nownot	remoteCTRL	what you just typed had nothing to do with my previous comment ........
2008-08-05T00:58:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	nownot	you said you cant connect to it with your iphoen, so?
2008-08-05T00:59:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	nownot	so why cant you?
2008-08-05T00:59:00.000Z	nownot	remoteCTRL	exactly, vpn uses cert files, you cant do those on the iphone
2008-08-05T00:59:00.000Z	nownot	remoteCTRL	has to be pptp or ipsec with login / password
2008-08-05T00:59:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	nownot	that you meant, gimme a sec
2008-08-05T01:04:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	nownot	humm all i find is also ssl certificate based:/
2008-08-05T01:05:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	nownot	this here for example: http://www.ipsec-howto.org/t1.html
2008-08-05T01:06:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	nownot	would manuals keying help you? that would be this one: http://lartc.org/howto/lartc.ipsec.html
2008-08-05T01:09:00.000Z	nownot	remoteCTRL	not sure let me look, there are tons of info on connecting to pptp network but nothing on the forums about creating a pptp server
2008-08-05T01:10:00.000Z	nownot	remoteCTRL	seriously thinking about turning a old windows box into a pptp server and throwing it in teh corner
2008-08-05T01:11:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	nownot	hehe what about those manual keys, does that work on your iphone?
2008-08-05T01:11:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	nownot	btw you are aware that your iphone can do ssh?
2008-08-05T01:12:00.000Z	nownot	remoteCTRL	manual keys no help. and yes im aware, but i dont know what port the game runs on so it would be easiest to just to get a vpn going so all traffic is there
2008-08-05T01:16:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	nownot	what game are you speaking of? ssh runs on port 22
