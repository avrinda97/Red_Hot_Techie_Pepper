2008-04-28T17:53:00.000Z	sriramoma1		if someone has hardy dvd, can someone tell me how to add it in the list of repos?
2008-04-28T17:54:00.000Z	jrib	sriramoma1	you usually just insert the dvd and get prompted to add it
2008-04-28T17:54:00.000Z	sriramoma1	jrib	i inserted the dvd, but i dint get the prompt.
2008-04-28T17:56:00.000Z	jrib	sriramoma1	what happens when you try using apt-cdrom?
2008-04-28T17:59:00.000Z	sriramoma1	jrib	i used apt-cdrom add just now
2008-04-28T17:59:00.000Z	jrib	sriramoma1	and the result?
2008-04-28T18:00:00.000Z	sriramoma1	jrib	i mean i want to allow only this repo and disable the online repos
2008-04-28T18:00:00.000Z	jrib	sriramoma1	so go to system -> administration -> software sources and disable the online repos
2008-04-28T18:01:00.000Z	jrib	sriramoma1	it's a good idea to keep the security ones enabled though
2008-04-28T18:03:00.000Z	sriramoma1	jrib	when i disable and use add/remove i am able to see packages not there in the dvd itself! on checking on any software, it says "the list of applications is not available"
2008-04-28T18:04:00.000Z	jrib	sriramoma1	use apt-get on the command line so you can be specific about what is happening
2008-04-28T18:05:00.000Z	sriramoma1	jrib	is there any way to refresh list of repos and packages on command-line?
2008-04-28T18:05:00.000Z	jrib	sriramoma1	sudo apt-get update
2008-04-28T18:08:00.000Z	sriramoma1	jrib	i was able to install a package called kino successfully using command line
2008-04-28T18:09:00.000Z	sriramoma1	jrib	what category do i have to use in add/remove to show packages available in dvd only?
2008-04-28T18:09:00.000Z	sriramoma1	jrib	i mean the "show" category?
2008-04-28T18:09:00.000Z	jrib	sriramoma1	I don't know.  You could use System -> Administration -> Synaptic though
2008-04-28T18:10:00.000Z	sriramoma1	jrib	and for the same purpose in synaptic, what filter do i have to use?
2008-04-28T18:11:00.000Z	jrib	sriramoma1	it should only show you things in the repositories you have enabled afaik
