2009-10-20T20:13:00.000Z	equinox_		oki couple of questions?
2009-10-20T20:13:00.000Z	equinox_		1-why the heck after this many years, ubuntu, hasn't found a way of keeping the packages up to date..
2009-10-20T20:13:00.000Z	equinox_		2- what the F*CK is that software center.. like... WTF?
2009-10-20T20:13:00.000Z	equinox_		3- after all this time, still problems such as flash, and drivers..
2009-10-20T20:13:00.000Z	equinox_		4- after all this time, still a weird Boot up, why don't they FIRE GRUB...
2009-10-20T20:14:00.000Z	rsk	equinox_	do you expect an answear or do you just want to complan?
2009-10-20T20:14:00.000Z	equinox_	rsk	just complain..  dont think there are answers to that
2009-10-20T20:14:00.000Z	rsk	equinox_	there is, would you be intrested?
2009-10-20T20:15:00.000Z	rsk	equinox_	packages are updated twice a year, with some exceptions. like firefox usually gets a new version when it's out. + all other packages always gets security updates.
2009-10-20T20:16:00.000Z	rsk	equinox_	software center is just a publicity stunt i think, but it works good i think.
2009-10-20T20:16:00.000Z	rsk	equinox_	what problems with drivers? also flash it not ubuntu's fault it's adobe who make it.
2009-10-20T20:16:00.000Z	rsk	equinox_	and what do you mean by weird boot?
2009-10-20T20:17:00.000Z	equinox_	rsk	for example, since xp, have nver been successful with dual boot..
2009-10-20T20:17:00.000Z	equinox_	rsk	you install and setup grub to pick up your windows partition
2009-10-20T20:18:00.000Z	rsk	equinox_	i've never had that problem so i can't give any insight on it
2009-10-20T20:20:00.000Z	equinox_	rsk	also another weird thing, whenver i turn off by computer, there's this screen that comes up, as if the screen was dead
2009-10-20T20:21:00.000Z	equinox_	rsk	it shows up like some black patches, with some yellow white.,
2009-10-20T20:21:00.000Z	equinox_	rsk	can't quite explain.. you know what.. will comeback with a better compiled list of the troubles and details on how to recreate them
2009-10-20T20:26:00.000Z	rsk	equinox_	sure
