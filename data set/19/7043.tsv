2007-11-23T10:45:00.000Z	bazhang	joanki	you might want to enable the medibuntu.org repositories to play that dvd instructions can be found at the site
2007-11-23T10:47:00.000Z	bazhang	joanki	a physical dvd? I believe you need libdvdcss2 from medibuntu.org
2007-11-23T10:48:00.000Z	bazhang	joanki	try darkentity's way, and if that is not successful then check out medibuntu.org
2007-11-23T10:48:00.000Z	joanki	bazhang	can you help me get that thing you're talking about?
2007-11-23T10:48:00.000Z	bazhang	joanki	medibuntu.org is a website--take a look there
2007-11-23T10:52:00.000Z	bazhang	joanki	yes, but you need to a repository
2007-11-23T10:54:00.000Z	bazhang	joanki	best to be a bit patient, not much more now
2007-11-23T11:05:00.000Z	bazhang	joanki	I can get you up and running if you just calm down a bit
2007-12-28T11:11:00.000Z	bazhang	joanki	need a space after xchat?
2008-03-22T20:50:00.000Z	bazhang	joanki	where are they generally downloaded? check there
