2006-06-30T08:04:00.000Z	snoops	scanner_X	oh sorry.. Well err.. From the inside of the local network or the outside?
2006-06-30T08:04:00.000Z	scanner_X		inside
2006-06-30T08:06:00.000Z	scanner_X	snoops	sorry to rush you, but i only have a few mins.  I said 'inside' if you didnt see it
2006-06-30T08:07:00.000Z	snoops	scanner_X	if he's not using dhcp you'll just need to obviously connect to his switch/router with some ethernet cable.. then if he isn't using dhcp you'll need to just configure your local ip address and gateway.. which he should be able to give you.. such as ip 192.168.1.100 and gateway 192.168.1.1
2006-06-30T08:07:00.000Z	scanner_X	snoops	he is using dchp
2006-06-30T08:08:00.000Z	snoops	scanner_X	then it should be a matter of connecting, and turning your pc on
2006-06-30T08:08:00.000Z	scanner_X		see, it connects, but i cant use any interent apps.  eg. Firefox, Gaim, XChat
2006-06-30T08:09:00.000Z	scanner_X	snoops	see, it connects, but i cant use any interent apps.  eg. Firefox, Gaim, XChat
2006-06-30T08:11:00.000Z	snoops	scanner_X	umm well it should.. a problem with his network then.. you can check your ip settings with ipconfig.. maybe his dhcp isn't setup for dns as well..in which case you'd need to statically set it
2006-06-30T08:11:00.000Z	scanner_X	snoops	okay, thats what i was going to do.  What are the terminal commands
2006-06-30T08:12:00.000Z	snoops	scanner_X	you can set the ip/dns etc from the gui! system>administration>network I believe
