2007-01-30T11:03:00.000Z	ForgeAus		whats a file thats of socket type about ?
2007-01-30T11:03:00.000Z	ForgeAus		(as opposed to a directory, link, file, etc etc...)
2007-01-30T11:04:00.000Z	ForgeAus		hmmm ok then whats a socket (I thought it was a network thing)
2007-01-30T11:04:00.000Z	ForgeAus		not virtual PC
2007-01-30T11:05:00.000Z	ForgeAus		(or Xen)
2007-01-30T11:05:00.000Z	ForgeAus		so is VMware server
2007-01-30T11:05:00.000Z	ForgeAus		(there are vmware products that aren't free)
2007-01-30T11:05:00.000Z	ForgeAus		yes so does VMWARE!
2007-01-30T11:05:00.000Z	ForgeAus		and XEN (can anyway)
2007-01-30T11:05:00.000Z	ForgeAus		I know because I used it
2007-01-30T11:05:00.000Z	LjL	ForgeAus	and virtualbox
2007-01-30T11:10:00.000Z	LjL	ForgeAus	why? /tmp is wiped at every reboot anyway
2007-01-30T11:10:00.000Z	ForgeAus	LjL	not on my filesystem it doesn't seem to be
2007-01-30T11:11:00.000Z	LjL	ForgeAus	well, not knowing what it is, i'd not consider it safe to delete it
2007-01-30T11:12:00.000Z	LjL	ForgeAus	being a socket that's not quite surprising... i still don't know what it *is* though
2007-01-30T11:12:00.000Z	LjL	ForgeAus	why delete it, anyway?
2007-01-30T11:12:00.000Z	ForgeAus	LjL	good point
2008-08-31T15:54:00.000Z	LjL	ForgeAus	i don't think so, although of course Kubuntu does
2008-08-31T15:54:00.000Z	LjL	ForgeAus	i guess you could always, say, "apt-cache --recurse depends ubuntu-desktop | grep qt"
