2007-05-15T07:52:00.000Z	tinin	barbarella_me	i know, i found nice tutorials about nmap but i still don't know how to get an ip. Could i do it by msn? with a sniffer?
2007-05-15T07:53:00.000Z	tinin	barbarella_me	or any other idea, because from what i've read, ip changes, so im would be the best way
2007-05-15T07:54:00.000Z	tinin	barbarella_me	that is what i was thinking
2007-05-15T07:54:00.000Z	tinin	barbarella_me	an email is not a good sollution
2007-05-15T07:55:00.000Z	tinin	barbarella_me	coul i do it that way? with a sniffer, sending her something?

2007-05-15T08:09:00.000Z	tinin	barbarella_me	but where on an email coul i see the ip? i do not see any numbers?
2007-05-15T08:11:00.000Z	tinin	barbarella_me	well i have emails but sent from work, and that's not nice, i should not play with that pc :(
