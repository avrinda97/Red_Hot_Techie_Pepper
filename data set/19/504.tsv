2012-01-25T19:58:00.000Z	nyrpnz	alfredo	which program are you using (it is hard to understand when the question is broken into ten lines)?
2012-01-25T20:01:00.000Z	nyrpnz	alfredo	found this: http://blogilo.gnufolks.org/forum/topic/failing-miserably-configuring-blogspot-account
2012-01-25T20:01:00.000Z	nyrpnz	alfredo	if you are running chrome you can autotranslate this page (http://blogilo.gnufolks.org/forum/topic/failing-miserably-configuring-blogspot-account) which seems to have the answer
2012-01-25T20:01:00.000Z	nyrpnz	alfredo	it is in spanish
2012-01-25T20:02:00.000Z	nyrpnz	alfredo	looks like you need the BlogID, not the url...?
2012-01-25T20:03:00.000Z	nyrpnz	alfredo	had you already tried that?
2012-01-25T20:03:00.000Z	nyrpnz	alfredo	k then, good luck
2012-01-25T20:05:00.000Z	nyrpnz	alfredo	where is the Fetch ID button, in the program or in Blogger?
2012-01-25T20:06:00.000Z	nyrpnz	alfredo	try going to your settings in Blogger, and in the url should be something that looks like &blogID=XXXXXXXXX, copy the number into Blogilo
