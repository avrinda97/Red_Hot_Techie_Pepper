2008-01-23T05:11:00.000Z	CruCio		hmm
2008-01-23T05:12:00.000Z	CruCio		kubuntu can work alongside ubuntu right ?
2008-01-23T05:13:00.000Z	CruCio		Cpuden80 , is it only the KDE package or is kubuntu included ?
2008-01-23T05:14:00.000Z	CruCio		i have my ubuntu installed oy my PS3 and though i love it i its impossible to install java on it
2008-01-23T05:14:00.000Z	soundray	CruCio	if you want the full kubuntu desktop, do a 'sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop'
2008-01-23T05:14:00.000Z	CruCio	soundray	, and doing this will install kubuntu and delete ubuntu right ?
2008-01-23T05:15:00.000Z	soundray	CruCio	no
2008-01-23T05:15:00.000Z	soundray	CruCio	it won't delete anything (and you shouldn't, unless you're really short of space)
2008-01-23T05:16:00.000Z	soundray	CruCio	you can choose whether to use gnome or kde at login time
2008-01-23T05:18:00.000Z	soundray	CruCio	if you choose a kde session, you will have a desktop environment that is exactly the same one as a kubuntu installation would provide
2008-01-23T05:19:00.000Z	soundray	CruCio	no, because you will still have the choice to log out and use gnome instead of KDE
2008-01-23T05:20:00.000Z	soundray	CruCio	only if you install the kubuntu-desktop package and all its dependencies
2008-01-23T05:21:00.000Z	soundray	CruCio	you will find out
2008-01-23T05:22:00.000Z	CruCio	soundray	, am i know tnothing about linux
2008-01-23T05:22:00.000Z	soundray	CruCio	the way to find out things is to try them
2008-01-23T05:23:00.000Z	soundray	CruCio	you can use synaptic in kubuntu, but you may prefer to use adept
2008-01-23T05:35:00.000Z	soundray	CruCio	you're not ontopic any more -- please stop
2008-01-23T05:37:00.000Z	CruCio	soundray	 am using PPC64 wouldn't matter right ?
2008-01-23T05:39:00.000Z	soundray	CruCio	look, you can either go and use what you've learned, or waste yours and everyone's time here by going on and on and on about it.
