2007-11-25T21:40:00.000Z	stoneman		hi there, is there any tutorials on the ubuntu forums for a beginners to using the terminal to tar(compress) and untar files?
2007-11-25T21:41:00.000Z	levander	stoneman	'tar xf <filename>' extracts from a tar file - x is for extract
2007-11-25T21:41:00.000Z	levander	stoneman	'tar cf <filename> <files...>' Creates a tar file named <filename>.  That tar file contains <files...>
2007-11-25T21:41:00.000Z	levander	stoneman	For more, check 'man tar'
2007-11-25T21:42:00.000Z	stoneman	levander	ah cool tyvm !
2007-11-25T21:42:00.000Z	levander	stoneman	one more
2007-11-25T21:42:00.000Z	levander	stoneman	'tar xzf <filename>' extracts from a tarr'd and gzipped file. tar has no compression - it just puts all files in one big tarball.  You gzip the tarball to compress it (make it smaller).
2007-11-25T21:43:00.000Z	levander	stoneman	and, 'tar czf <filename> <files...>' creates the tar file, and compresses it
2007-11-25T21:43:00.000Z	stoneman	levander	ah excellent! hey there should be a stick in the forums for this!
2007-11-25T21:43:00.000Z	levander	stoneman	you can't have a stick for everything
2007-11-25T21:43:00.000Z	stoneman	levander	true
2007-11-25T21:44:00.000Z	levander	stoneman	you may benefit from a basic UNIX command line (probably bash shell) tutorial.  I'm sure there are plenty on the internet.  That's where you'd find stuff like tar.
2007-11-25T21:46:00.000Z	levander		Does the Add/Remove application not give you the form of the package name that you would use on the command line, with apt-get?
2007-11-25T21:52:00.000Z	stoneman	levander	well i tried tar cvzf, however it only compressed the file(size of 700mb) to 680mb, is there a way to compress even further?
2007-11-25T21:54:00.000Z	levander	stoneman	bzip compresses more than gzip, but not much more.  bzip just isn't as commonly used, and so you can't share the file with other people as easily.  But, for bzip, just use a j instead of a z in tar's command line options.
2007-11-25T21:54:00.000Z	levander	stoneman	I'd remake the whole tar file.  Don't bzip the gzip file you already made.  Make a new tar file, and bzip that.
2007-11-25T21:55:00.000Z	stoneman	levander	cool ty
2007-11-25T21:55:00.000Z	stoneman	levander	tar cvjf = correct?
2007-11-25T21:56:00.000Z	levander	stoneman	yeah
