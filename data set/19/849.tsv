2011-08-23T10:51:00.000Z	urlin2u	zertyui	look in synaptic
2011-08-23T10:53:00.000Z	urlin2u	zertyui	it is in synaptic you may need the universe repo ticked on.
2011-08-23T11:00:00.000Z	urlin2u	zertyui	you how to get to the repos in synaptic?
2011-08-23T11:03:00.000Z	urlin2u	zertyui	it is canonical partners actually  http://imagebin.org/169263
2011-08-23T11:06:00.000Z	urlin2u	zertyui	hmm have you looked in synaptic with this exactly, sun-java6-jre
2011-08-23T11:07:00.000Z	urlin2u	zertyui	on the first tab is the universe and multiverse as well.
2011-08-23T11:12:00.000Z	urlin2u	zertyui	apparently in medibuntu. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java
2011-08-23T11:14:00.000Z	urlin2u	zertyui	this link may be a more understandable as to adding the medibuntu repos, then update && upgrade the java should bee in synaptic then.  http://www.liberiangeek.net/2011/04/add-medibuntu-repository-ubuntu-11-04-natty-narwhal/
2011-08-23T11:15:00.000Z	urlin2u	zertyui	your running licd hold on
2011-08-23T11:16:00.000Z	urlin2u	zertyui	run the two command sets here then update & upgrade. http://medibuntu.org/repository.php
2011-08-23T11:19:00.000Z	urlin2u	zertyui	medibuntu is a repository where the java you want comes from.

2011-08-23T11:25:00.000Z	urlin2u	zertyui	yes, sorry for the problems.
2011-08-23T11:26:00.000Z	urlin2u	zertyui	you need to add that to the apt sources.list
2011-08-23T11:27:00.000Z	urlin2u	zertyui	sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
2011-08-23T11:31:00.000Z	urlin2u	zertyui	cool I think the command was without the quotes to work.
