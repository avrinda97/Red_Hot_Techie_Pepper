2008-01-13T22:59:00.000Z	brophat		what is a command to show my ip address?
2008-01-13T22:59:00.000Z	brophat		ok
2008-01-13T23:01:00.000Z	brophat		if I have a few puters on my lan here at home, each puter will have a different IP address?
2008-01-13T23:01:00.000Z	brophat		sweeet
2008-01-13T23:01:00.000Z	astro76	brophat	do you have a router?, if so it will hand out different addresses to each machine via DHCP
2008-01-13T23:02:00.000Z	astro76	brophat	so your machine makes a dhcp request to the router, and the router tells the machines the IP info
2008-01-13T23:03:00.000Z	astro76	brophat	no you only have one IP from your ISP which is exposed externally, inside your network you have local only addresses, like 192.168.x.x
2008-01-13T23:03:00.000Z	brophat	astro76	so the IP address on one particular comupter in the house may be different each time it boots up?
2008-01-13T23:04:00.000Z	astro76	brophat	yes indeed, to get around that you can either set a static IP on each machine, or better yet if your router supports it, you can have it give the same IP to each machine everytime based on the machine's MAC address
2008-01-13T23:04:00.000Z	brophat	astro76	sounds interesting
2008-01-13T23:05:00.000Z	brophat	astro76	I would have to get the routers user manual to figure that out?
2008-01-13T23:05:00.000Z	astro76	brophat	also depending on your router you can put a name for each machine in, and use names instead of IPs, otherwise you would add them to /etc/hosts on each machine
2008-01-13T23:05:00.000Z	astro76	brophat	if you need to I guess ;)
2008-01-13T23:09:00.000Z	astro76	brophat	yes add/remove has gui stuff only
2008-01-13T23:09:00.000Z	astro76	brophat	I promptly remove that one from my menu ;)
2008-01-13T23:09:00.000Z	astro76	brophat	it's fine to use
2008-05-19T07:03:00.000Z	astro76	brophat	yes
2008-05-19T07:03:00.000Z	astro76	brophat	though you might double-check in #hardware
2008-05-19T07:04:00.000Z	brophat	astro76	thanks. my guess would be that it would not matter.
