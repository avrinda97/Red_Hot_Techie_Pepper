2008-02-19T09:27:00.000Z	dogpigeoncow		hey i have a program i downloaded called Liquid wars 6 and i have the same problem i have with every program i download wtihout hte add/remove thing. i cant install it. i have the " ./configure      make      make install" command but i dont know how to use them coz nothing happens in terminal
2008-02-19T09:28:00.000Z	EnvoyRising	dogpigeoncow	make sure to have the build-essential package installed
2008-02-19T09:29:00.000Z	EnvoyRising	dogpigeoncow	"sudo apt-get install build-essential"from command line
2008-02-19T09:29:00.000Z	EnvoyRising	dogpigeoncow	then perhaps i misunderstand your question
2008-02-19T09:31:00.000Z	EnvoyRising	dogpigeoncow	just go to synaptic and disable cd from repos
2008-02-19T09:31:00.000Z	EnvoyRising	dogpigeoncow	then sudo apt-get update && sudo-apt get install build-essentials
2008-02-19T09:32:00.000Z	EnvoyRising	dogpigeoncow	with the cdrom disabled from repolist, it should fetch most recent stable version from internet isntead
2008-02-19T09:33:00.000Z	EnvoyRising	dogpigeoncow	what else do you have running?
2008-02-19T09:33:00.000Z	EnvoyRising	dogpigeoncow	if you are currently apt-getting something else or running an update, it'll say that
2008-02-19T09:34:00.000Z	EnvoyRising	dogpigeoncow	if you are and don't want to stop those processes, you can always just comment out the cdrom repo from your/etc/apt/sources.list file
2008-02-19T09:38:00.000Z	EnvoyRising	dogpigeoncow	dont' forget to sudo apt-get update as well
2008-02-19T09:40:00.000Z	EnvoyRising	dogpigeoncow	side not, if ./configure produces errors about a package not being found, make sure you have the "-dev(el)" version of that package installed as well
2008-02-19T09:46:00.000Z	EnvoyRising	dogpigeoncow	thats my mistake, dunno why i put an s there. installed the package so many times :P
2008-02-19T09:47:00.000Z	EnvoyRising	dogpigeoncow	so it says 0 packages to install or that the package can't be found?
2008-02-19T09:49:00.000Z	EnvoyRising	dogpigeoncow	then its already installed it woudl seem
2008-02-19T09:59:00.000Z	EnvoyRising	dogpigeoncow	gmp? justa sec
2008-02-19T10:00:00.000Z	EnvoyRising	dogpigeoncow	you have to install the gmp dev package
2008-02-19T10:00:00.000Z	EnvoyRising	dogpigeoncow	specifically libgmp3-dev
2008-02-19T10:03:00.000Z	EnvoyRising	dogpigeoncow	essentially. aptitude just remembers dependencies better so that when you uninstall packages you don't have a whole bunch of extra packages left over. supposedly apt-get does this nowadays, but i'm not sure how well
