2008-05-14T12:49:00.000Z	[Lowkey]		Is there a better way to run windows programs than WINE?
2008-05-14T12:50:00.000Z	[Lowkey]		Wine doesn't run half of things I want to
2008-05-14T12:51:00.000Z	microwaver	[Lowkey]	virtualbox
2008-05-14T12:51:00.000Z	microwaver	[Lowkey]	it's a similar construction as VMware is.
2008-05-14T12:52:00.000Z	microwaver	[Lowkey]	yes. it could be you need to install it though.
