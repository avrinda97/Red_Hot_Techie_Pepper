2006-03-27T14:41:00.000Z	Esco		hey what does it mean "sudo:unable to lookup via gethost by name ()"?????
2006-03-27T14:41:00.000Z	mwe	Esco	probably that /etc/hosts is broken
2006-03-27T14:42:00.000Z	mwe	Esco	fix it
2006-03-27T14:42:00.000Z	mwe	Esco	paste the contents on pastebin.com
2006-03-27T14:42:00.000Z	mwe	Esco	paste the contents on pastebin.com
2006-03-27T15:09:00.000Z	mwe	Esco	paste it on pastebin.com
2006-03-27T15:09:00.000Z	Esco	mwe	http://pastebin.com/616848
2006-03-27T15:10:00.000Z	mwe	Esco	it says 127.0.0.1 localhost.localdomain.localhost
2006-03-27T15:10:00.000Z	mwe	Esco	it should say 127.0.0.1 localhost.localdomain localhost
2006-03-27T15:11:00.000Z	Esco	mwe	:oh its my mistake
2006-03-27T15:11:00.000Z	mwe	Esco	it will probably work if you correct that
2006-03-27T15:12:00.000Z	mwe	Esco	so the file says 127.0.0.1 localhost.localdomain localhost?
2006-03-27T15:13:00.000Z	mwe	Esco	what's up with line 12?
2006-03-27T15:13:00.000Z	mwe	Esco	you should probably remove that
2006-03-27T15:16:00.000Z	mwe	Esco	possibly. the entry seems like it does not belong in there at least
2006-03-27T15:16:00.000Z	mwe	Esco	make a backup of the file before messing to much with it, though
2006-03-27T15:17:00.000Z	mwe	Esco	what does 'hostname' give you ?
2006-03-27T15:19:00.000Z	mwe	Esco	when you type "hostname" in a terminal, what do you get back?
2006-03-27T15:19:00.000Z	mwe	Esco	no quotes though
