2009-09-11T01:44:00.000Z	Turbolinux		Hello. I asked before this question and I am asking today. I have a HP Pavilion dv7-1040 notebook computer. The notebook computer works very good on Ubuntu but I can't hear sound. The soundcard is HDA Intel. What can I do?

2010-07-25T20:55:00.000Z	erUSUL	Turbolinux	well i'm in the same position as you. either yo trust the blog post or not ...
2010-07-25T20:56:00.000Z	Turbolinux	erUSUL	I trust but it doesn't tell the place for copying to the file. I want to know this because I don't want to do a mistake.
2010-07-25T20:57:00.000Z	erUSUL	Turbolinux	it says; the file is /etc/sysfs.conf
2010-07-25T20:58:00.000Z	Turbolinux	erUSUL	Yes but I don't know the specific place.
2010-07-25T20:59:00.000Z	erUSUL	Turbolinux	the filenname tells you. directory /etc/ filename sysfs.conf
2010-07-25T21:01:00.000Z	erUSUL	Turbolinux	that is an absolute pathname.
2010-07-25T21:07:00.000Z	erUSUL	Turbolinux	i bet that the lines on the file can be anywhere in it.
2010-07-25T21:08:00.000Z	Turbolinux	erUSUL	I understand so I will try to save under ''Examples'' are. I hope it will work.
