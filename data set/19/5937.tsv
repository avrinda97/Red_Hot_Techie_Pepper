2008-04-13T18:44:00.000Z	LebLinux		if I install libc6 from hardy on Gutsy would I break my system?
2008-04-13T18:45:00.000Z	unop_	LebLinux	it might, that depends on whether the lic6 package (or its depends) conflict with existing packages on the system .. it is not recommended you do that though
2008-04-13T18:48:00.000Z	LebLinux	unop_	I wanted to install a package , and i did it and it worked, but now when I ran update-manager it gave me an error that I should run apt-get -f install, when I ran it, it gave me alot of packages including packages of thw wm to be removed, I choosed No
2008-04-13T18:50:00.000Z	unop_	LebLinux	i'm not surprised you've got that problem now - it's not wise to cross-install packages
2008-04-13T18:50:00.000Z	LebLinux	unop_	so I'll remove the package that required the libc6 from hardy and install the gutsy one?
2008-04-13T18:52:00.000Z	unop_	LebLinux	have you got any hardy sources in your /etc/apt/sources.list ?  if so, remove them first and run this.  sudo aptitude install libc6=2.6.1-1ubuntu10
2008-04-13T18:52:00.000Z	unop_	LebLinux	and then run. sudo aptitude install -f
2008-04-13T18:53:00.000Z	unop_	LebLinux	ok, run those two commands then
2008-04-13T18:55:00.000Z	LebLinux	unop_	I can't remove libc6
2008-04-13T18:56:00.000Z	unop_	LebLinux	use the !pastebin (don't paste in here) and let's have a look at what you see there
2008-04-13T19:00:00.000Z	LebLinux	unop_	http://pastebin.com/m742c6a39
2008-04-13T19:01:00.000Z	unop_	LebLinux	thats not what i asked you to run tho :)
2008-04-13T19:01:00.000Z	unop_	LebLinux	sudo aptitude install libc6=2.6.1-1ubuntu10; sudo aptitude install -f
2008-04-13T19:02:00.000Z	LebLinux	unop_	alright.
2008-04-13T19:03:00.000Z	LebLinux	unop_	Am am downgrading libc6
2008-04-13T19:08:00.000Z	LebLinux	unop_	thank you, it works!
2008-04-13T19:09:00.000Z	unop_	LebLinux	well, now - i can tell you, it's ok to maintain a mixed-system, just as long as you know what you are doing :)
2008-04-13T19:10:00.000Z	LebLinux	unop_	the trick was in aptitude? could it work with the libc6 that I've installed from hardy?
2008-04-13T19:10:00.000Z	LebLinux	unop_	because when it asked me to remove all these packages I was surprised!
