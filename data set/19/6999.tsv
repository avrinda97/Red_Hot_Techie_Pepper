2007-10-27T20:19:00.000Z	sharpie		is there a way to make the contents of the window visible while scaling it? (in other words, see the inside of the window while scaling instead of a blue square)
2007-10-27T20:19:00.000Z	cdm10	sharpie	Do you have the advanced compiz configuration manager installed?
2007-10-27T20:19:00.000Z	sharpie	cdm10	yeah
2007-10-27T20:20:00.000Z	cdm10	sharpie	Actually, it's called ccsm or ADvanced Desktop Settings Manager or whatever.
2007-10-27T20:20:00.000Z	sharpie	cdm10	that's irrelevant =\
2007-10-27T20:21:00.000Z	sharpie	cdm10	so...uh, where is it there? :\
2007-10-27T20:21:00.000Z	cdm10	sharpie	Yeah... hold on, I'm finding the option.
2007-10-27T20:21:00.000Z	sharpie	cdm10	thanks. oh, and while you're at it, what's the "put" plugin do? :\
2007-10-27T20:21:00.000Z	sharpie	cdm10	never mind, i found the resize thing
2007-10-27T20:22:00.000Z	cdm10	sharpie	oh, cool. Sorry I couldn't find it very fast :)
2007-10-27T20:22:00.000Z	cdm10	sharpie	Damn, it's right there in front of me, in Uncategorized!
2007-10-27T20:22:00.000Z	cdm10		heh
2007-10-27T20:22:00.000Z	sharpie	cdm10	but do you know what "put" is? (under window management)
2007-10-27T20:22:00.000Z	cdm10	sharpie	I think it lets you use keyboard combos to move a window to the center or sides of the screen.
2007-10-27T20:23:00.000Z	sharpie	cdm10	thx, and 1 last thing: what's screenshot?
2007-10-27T20:23:00.000Z	cdm10	sharpie	It lets you take a screenshot of whatever's in a square you draw on your screen.
2007-10-27T20:24:00.000Z	sharpie		um, i'll try it =o
2007-10-27T20:24:00.000Z	cdm10	sharpie	I don't find it that useful, I just use the normal screenshot app :)
2007-10-27T20:24:00.000Z	sharpie	cdm10	thanks for all your help, i'm off now =o
