2007-07-22T05:37:00.000Z	Phuein		*cries* opensuse just died on me when i installed a bad nvidia driver :'(
2007-07-22T05:37:00.000Z	Phuein		and when trying to install Ubuntu it gave me that common error right after GRUB runs :'(
2007-07-22T05:39:00.000Z	Anlar	Phuein	sudo grub, then "root (hd0,0)" and "setup (hd0)", assuming your boot partition is the first partition on first disc (adjust numbers accordingly, first one is disc, second one partition).. actually the installation otherwise succeeded
2007-07-22T05:40:00.000Z	Phuein	Anlar	im talking about the grub before installing, not after. Right when trying to load live cd...
2007-07-22T05:40:00.000Z	Anlar	Phuein	THAT grub? uhh.. that's really rare, must have ssomething to do with your bios/chipset :o you could try enabling all legacy support options in your bios..
2007-07-22T05:41:00.000Z	Phuein	Anlar	:S i saw some people talkin about the wiring of the harddrives... but i should be alright on that. It didnt happen with the older Ubuntu. Im just unlucky :'( (been through 10 distros as a noob linuxer)
2007-07-22T05:42:00.000Z	Anlar	Phuein	you can't buy a Fiat Punto and expect it to perform like Ferrari Enzo
2007-07-22T05:44:00.000Z	Phuein	Anlar	my hardware may be simple and cheap (cheap intel motherboard, geforce 4 mx440 etc), but if Windows can set me up quick and good, then any of today's OSs should be able to do the same, atleast similarly - agree?
2007-07-22T05:46:00.000Z	Anlar	Phuein	couldn't care less, I'm elitistic :) but, you should post as much information as you ever can about that on launchpad so that they can make sure gutsy (released in couple months ...) will work
2007-07-22T05:46:00.000Z	Phuein	Anlar	*cries*
2007-07-22T05:47:00.000Z	Anlar	Phuein	you get any special errors?
2007-07-22T05:50:00.000Z	Phuein	Anlar	couldnt get my Edimax usb wifi card (zd1211 argh) to work on like 10 distros (after several days of tuts etc). Then when openSUSE 10.2 actually showed me some magic (had to install zd1211 firmware even there), i had lots of bugs with packages, eg the nvidia system killer :(
2007-07-22T05:52:00.000Z	Anlar	Phuein	zd1211 is problematic always, but possible. I've helped someone to get it running once... nvidia problems can be always fixed.. the one that you have with the ubuntu's cd is worse. you could install "ubuntu server" for the older version.. then, instantly after installation, upgrade it from network to feisty. and after that, install "ubuntu-desktop". a bit long route but should just work
2007-07-22T05:54:00.000Z	Phuein	Anlar	im sure you would agree that that is a totally wrong way of doing things for a considerabley good and simple (and smart?) linux distro of 2007 :S
2007-07-22T05:54:00.000Z	Anlar	Phuein	most of the devels and users have 2007 hardware to test with, and just couple older machines to check backwards compatibility anymore...
2007-07-22T05:56:00.000Z	Phuein	Anlar	never the less, having machines from 2000 and newer not be simply compatible, including similar hardware - now thats ridiculous. There should atleast be a quicky script DB, instead of spending days on learning the different linux commands and bins :S no?? am i too accustomed to windows already?
2007-07-22T05:57:00.000Z	Anlar	Phuein	there's really no "similar hardware" when you start working with the hardware drivers... it's really complicated stuff and even the slightest difference can prove fatal
2007-07-22T05:58:00.000Z	Phuein	Anlar	but somehow the windows teams managed ? or is it because they have the vendors on their side as often said? (but often seems exeggerated)
2007-07-22T05:59:00.000Z	Anlar	Phuein	microsoft generalyl doesn't touch drivers and hardware support at all. it's the hardware vendors.
