2007-10-25T22:28:00.000Z	Vov4ik	pike_	my server is near me
2007-10-25T22:30:00.000Z	pike_	Vov4ik	basically there are two issues.  you have a file on ubuntu that tells it where your home dir should be this is /etc/passwd  so since this hasnt changed then all you need to do is create that directory in  /home you can do this by rebooting in recovery mode and doing mkdir /home/whateverusername;chown whateverusername:whateverusername /home/whateverusername   and reboot. that should be it
2007-10-26T00:20:00.000Z	pike_	Vov4ik	the -r stands for recursive the -f is of course force. be careful doing that esp if you are using sudo
