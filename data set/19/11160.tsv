2006-04-12T11:50:00.000Z	DBO	Toma-	we got that working, what program do you use to view the output?
2006-04-22T12:08:00.000Z	Toma-	DBO	feel free. why wouldnt anyone want that to happen? its getting people to believe you as a trusted source thats the problem
2006-04-22T12:09:00.000Z	Toma-	DBO	just make sure the people installing know that
2006-05-01T07:41:00.000Z	Toma-	DBO	bad sectors? tried using fsck?
2006-05-01T07:41:00.000Z	DBO	Toma-	I dont even have an hda, all my drives are SATA which means SCSI interface which means sda
2006-05-01T07:42:00.000Z	DBO	Toma-	but I did think of that, and I did fsck em, they are quite clean
2006-05-01T07:42:00.000Z	Toma-	DBO	could be udev or hal trying to make them hda type devices. and from that it will obviously think its bad if its an SATA drive. gmm
2006-05-01T07:45:00.000Z	Toma-	DBO	network traffic??????
2006-05-01T07:46:00.000Z	DBO	Toma-	your guess is as good as mine on that one.  But I kid you not, these errors showed up when I was testing a router's weakness to ARP poisoning
2006-05-01T07:47:00.000Z	Toma-	DBO	hotplug. try grepping for something about hda and hotplug...
2006-05-01T07:47:00.000Z	DBO	Toma-	no hotplug on this system
2006-05-01T07:47:00.000Z	Toma-	DBO	so modules are getting loaded by themselves?
2006-05-01T07:48:00.000Z	DBO	Toma-	no need for it really
2006-05-01T07:49:00.000Z	Toma-	DBO	yeh, my guess is something like udev, hal, or hotplug are loading this drive but dont recognise it as SATA...
2006-05-01T07:50:00.000Z	DBO	Toma-	you might be right, but the network traffic link doesnt make sense, but here it is, I can reproduce it with ettercap...
2006-05-01T07:52:00.000Z	Toma-	DBO	probably something to do withy the inner workings of module alias's and the automations. File a bug if you can find the root of this evil. However, i gtg :(
2006-05-01T07:53:00.000Z	DBO	Toma-	thanks for the help on tracking this down, I nearly had a heart attack looking at my logs this morning
2006-05-01T07:55:00.000Z	Toma-	DBO	i can imagine :D try giving dapper live cd a spin, and see if its fixed. otherwise, get onto it in the bug lists, coz this is really something that could send bells ringing in system admins on server and such!
2006-05-01T07:56:00.000Z	DBO	Toma-	I can't get this specific setup for testing again till next friday, but I will.  I need a shower and new pants now
