2009-07-18T14:00:00.000Z	tgrinaker		Hi all, am very new to ubuntu and am having major issues with some suggested file manager uploads which seem to have killed my hard drive space, and now NOTHING works? Can anyone help or suggest advice? (I have a Dell Mini 9)
2009-07-18T14:01:00.000Z	tgrinaker		:-(
2009-07-18T14:01:00.000Z	bazhang	tgrinaker	which file upload manager
2009-07-18T14:02:00.000Z	bazhang	tgrinaker	does it have a name?
2009-07-18T14:03:00.000Z	bazhang	tgrinaker	what error are you getting specifically
2009-07-18T14:04:00.000Z	bazhang	tgrinaker	it says it is full but it is not?
2009-07-18T14:06:00.000Z	bazhang	tgrinaker	did these ever work? what version of Ubuntu
2009-07-18T14:08:00.000Z	bazhang	tgrinaker	pre-installed? you installed it? did it ever work at all?  lsb_release -a for version in the terminal
2009-07-18T14:10:00.000Z	bazhang	tgrinaker	so the error is; the drive is full, when in fact it is not?
2009-07-18T14:14:00.000Z	bazhang	tgrinaker	what is hdd size in that mini?
2009-07-18T14:18:00.000Z	bazhang	tgrinaker	I have that issue with my eeepc 4GB ssd as well
2009-07-18T14:19:00.000Z	bazhang	tgrinaker	one thing to consider would be to have a persistent usb drive, and run off that, or use a usb stick to access movies/music etc and leave hdd relatively empty
2009-07-18T14:19:00.000Z	bazhang	tgrinaker	right, because it cant cache the needed space for that
2009-07-18T14:20:00.000Z	bazhang	tgrinaker	simpy sudo apt-remove <packagename> on them
2009-07-18T14:21:00.000Z	bazhang	tgrinaker	ignore that last
2009-07-18T14:21:00.000Z	bazhang	tgrinaker	sudo apt-get remove <packagename>
2009-07-18T14:27:00.000Z	bazhang	tgrinaker	iirc dell has some special repositories for software to make things like wireless work for that machine, and the install probably leaves you with a bit more than a GB of free space; if you kept your various, movies and music on a separate usb stick and left the home folder relatively empty , then it would likely eliminate some of your issues regarding space
2009-07-18T14:28:00.000Z	tgrinaker	bazhang	thanks, will get a bigger USB stick to help with that, and will try clear out anything I have! Thanks
2009-07-18T14:28:00.000Z	bazhang	tgrinaker	you're welcome
