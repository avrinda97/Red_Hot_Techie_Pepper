2008-08-28T17:57:00.000Z	Theaxiom		If I can't fix grub no matter what I do, and it always comes out with the result of "selected disk does not exist" when I select an OS, would it be a good idea to create a boot partition?
2008-08-28T17:58:00.000Z	Jafet	Theaxiom	I don't see what that problem has to do with a separate boot partition.
2008-08-28T17:58:00.000Z	Theaxiom	Jafet	I have reinstalled grub numerous times, and tried everything I can find, and I can not get grub to boot any partitions, even a clean ubuntu install! It always says "selected disk does not exist" Do you know what is going on?
2008-08-28T17:59:00.000Z	Theaxiom	Jafet	I even tried unplugging my RAID controller and doing everything from scratch
2008-08-28T17:59:00.000Z	Jafet	Theaxiom	no idea at all.
2008-08-28T18:00:00.000Z	Theaxiom	Jafet	I even tried eliminating the RAID controller...
2008-08-28T18:00:00.000Z	Theaxiom	Jafet	Everything worked before I moved all my components to a new computer case, now everything is screwed, I can not even boot into WIndoze
2008-08-28T18:00:00.000Z	Theaxiom	Jafet	I am on the live cd, thank god for the live cd
2008-08-28T18:01:00.000Z	Jafet	Theaxiom	yes, thank god for that.
2008-08-28T18:02:00.000Z	Jafet	Theaxiom	no idea. I would just open menu.lst and check everything against the hardware config after I make any changes to anything.
2008-08-28T18:02:00.000Z	Theaxiom	Jafet	Everything in menu.lst is perfect though
2008-08-28T18:03:00.000Z	Theaxiom	Jafet	ah-ha when I installed grub this last time, after unplugging the RAID, it did not update my menu.lst - I will modify this and reboot and see if that works, thanks Jafet
2008-08-28T18:06:00.000Z	Jafet	Theaxiom	yeh, problems in that file are notoriously difficult to spot and difficult to diagnose when they explode.
2008-08-28T18:07:00.000Z	Theaxiom	Jafet	Yes, grub hardly ever fails, but when it does, I hear it is fantastic!
2008-08-28T18:12:00.000Z	Jafet	Theaxiom	Windows is very picky about disks, I hear; it'll only boot from the primary partition. grub remaps them to fool the Windows drivers.
2008-08-28T18:18:00.000Z	Theaxiom	Jafet	I think what I may do, is move the HD's off the RAID controller, and just put my optical drives on there to avoid issues, what do you think?
2008-08-28T18:18:00.000Z	Jafet	Theaxiom	no idea there.
2008-08-28T18:18:00.000Z	Theaxiom	Jafet	I am starting to think that the RAID controller does not have a bootable BIOS, and when grub loads, it can't see the drives on it, therefore changing the order, and number of drives. Do you think that may be a possibility?
2008-08-28T18:21:00.000Z	Theaxiom	Jafet	lmao
