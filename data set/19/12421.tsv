2006-04-30T16:28:00.000Z	tdn		Does anyone in here use gDesklets?
2006-04-30T10:09:00.000Z	tdn		Does Automatix work with the new Dapper Drake beta?
2006-04-30T10:10:00.000Z	thoreauputic	tdn	please forget automatix
2006-04-30T10:11:00.000Z	thoreauputic	tdn	I doubt it - it messes with your config files
2006-04-30T10:12:00.000Z	tdn	thoreauputic	so... You think that I need to reinstall from scratch?
2006-04-30T10:13:00.000Z	thoreauputic	tdn	I don't know - I suspect that an upgrade to dapper after using automatix might be... *cough* interesting
2006-04-30T10:13:00.000Z	tdn	thoreauputic	hmm... I have done that on three systems without problems.
2006-04-30T10:13:00.000Z	thoreauputic	tdn	YMMV as they say
2006-04-30T10:14:00.000Z	tdn	thoreauputic	YMMV?
2006-04-30T10:15:00.000Z	tdn	thoreauputic	okay.
2006-04-30T10:15:00.000Z	tdn	thoreauputic	but you would still reinstall the system?
2006-04-30T10:15:00.000Z	tdn	thoreauputic	even if it appearently works fine?
2006-04-30T10:15:00.000Z	thoreauputic	tdn	up to you really
2006-04-30T10:16:00.000Z	thoreauputic	tdn	I guess you only reinstall as a very last resort - this is Linux after all
2006-04-30T10:17:00.000Z	tdn	thoreauputic	yeah. I thought so. That was why I got very concerned, when it sounded like I had to reinstall.
2006-04-30T10:19:00.000Z	thoreauputic	tdn	ask the forums admins
2006-04-30T10:19:00.000Z	tdn	thoreauputic	I thought they was in here.
2007-03-11T06:37:00.000Z	thoreauputic	tdn	yes, herd 5 is a recent feisty alpha release
2007-03-11T06:37:00.000Z	tdn	thoreauputic	ok. Thanks.
