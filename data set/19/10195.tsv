2009-11-26T04:57:00.000Z	mneptok	chemjeff	dear God, that's overly complex for Flash.

2009-11-26T05:00:00.000Z	chemjeff	mneptok	does it matter that on the about:plugins page the Shockwave Flash filename is listed as npwrapper.libflashplayer.so and not libflashplayer.so ?
2009-11-26T05:03:00.000Z	chemjeff	mneptok	I downloaded the libflashplayer.so from this URL: http://labs.adobe.com/downloads/flashplayer10.html
