2008-03-18T04:44:00.000Z	theunixgeek		How can I get my resolution up to 1280 x 1024? It's not available in either Screen Resolution nor Screens and Graphics
2008-03-18T04:44:00.000Z	Pelo	theunixgeek	edit the xorg.conf file and add the extra resolution you want to the list
2008-03-18T04:44:00.000Z	theunixgeek	Pelo	how? :) I have xorg.conf open. where do I add the resolution?
2008-03-18T04:45:00.000Z	Pelo	theunixgeek	scroll further down,  you'll see it
2008-03-18T04:45:00.000Z	theunixgeek	Pelo	ok, restarting X now
2008-03-18T04:46:00.000Z	theunixgeek	Pelo	nope, still didn't work
2008-03-18T04:46:00.000Z	Pelo	theunixgeek	you now need to change the rez from the resolution applet in the pref menu
2008-03-18T04:46:00.000Z	Pelo	theunixgeek	you also needed to add the resolution to each colour dept
2008-03-18T04:46:00.000Z	theunixgeek	Pelo	I did; it's not there
2008-03-18T04:46:00.000Z	theunixgeek	Pelo	how?
2008-03-18T04:47:00.000Z	Pelo	theunixgeek	pastebin your xorg.conf file so I can have a look
2008-03-18T04:47:00.000Z	theunixgeek	Pelo	theunixgeek.pastebin.com/d7c0c9553
2008-03-18T04:48:00.000Z	Pelo	theunixgeek	hold on
2008-03-18T04:48:00.000Z	Pelo	theunixgeek	wrong url
2008-03-18T04:48:00.000Z	Pelo	theunixgeek	nvm
2008-03-18T04:48:00.000Z	theunixgeek	Pelo	http://theunixgeek.pastebin.com/d7c0c9553
2008-03-18T04:48:00.000Z	theunixgeek	Pelo	:P
2008-03-18T04:49:00.000Z	Pelo	theunixgeek	 i misinformed you ,  I didn't reallise you have and nvidia card,  check in synaptic, I belive there is a nvidia-settings package , you can do it from there,  ,and remove the resolutions you added in xorg.conf,  it was in the wrong place anyway
2008-03-18T04:50:00.000Z	theunixgeek	Pelo	thanks :)
