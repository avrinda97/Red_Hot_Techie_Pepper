2010-05-01T13:14:00.000Z	Mindwolf		Ok....one quick answer here
2010-05-01T13:14:00.000Z	Mindwolf		If I have an intel card/chip set, do I need Nvidia?
2010-05-01T13:14:00.000Z	Mindwolf		I've literally spent 5 days on this
2010-05-01T13:15:00.000Z	Mindwolf		When I removed it, I can no longer access my displays
2010-05-01T13:16:00.000Z	Mindwolf		I've changed nothing but Nvidia
2010-05-01T13:16:00.000Z	Mindwolf		Intel drivers are up to date
2010-05-01T13:16:00.000Z	Mindwolf		updatemanager -d?

2010-05-01T13:18:00.000Z	ravenkhan	Mindwolf	no i have got the image. If i upgrade it will take same time about 2-3 hrs which it took when i downloaded image
2010-05-01T13:19:00.000Z	Mindwolf		I just let it run in the background updating
2010-05-01T13:19:00.000Z	Mindwolf		I've too much stuff to lose
2010-05-01T13:19:00.000Z	ravenkhan	Mindwolf	yeah but since i have image so why not use that?
2010-05-01T13:19:00.000Z	Mindwolf		If I cannot solve my gfx issue and refrain from throwing the laptop, I will wipe clean
2010-05-01T13:20:00.000Z	Mindwolf		I guess you could
2010-05-01T13:20:00.000Z	ravenkhan		!repeat | winXPuser
