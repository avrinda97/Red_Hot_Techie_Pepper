2008-04-26T17:15:00.000Z	daniel_hh		Hello, yesterday I upgraded ubuntu 7.10 -> 8.04, but Firefox3 can't work with the old extension and ruined my profile so I can't go back to FF2. I removed the FF3 package and reinstalled FF2, but when I click on links on the desktop .. opera appears (which was installed, but didn't started as default). .. Setting the alternative for x-www-browser didn't worked, setting System>settings>prefered applications>browser to firefox didn't worked
2008-04-26T17:15:00.000Z	daniel_hh		... what can I do?
2008-04-26T17:17:00.000Z	daniel_hh		Anyone knows how to tell gnome that firefox2 is the default browser?
2008-04-26T17:18:00.000Z	lamothe	daniel_hh	Preferences->Preferred Applications.
2008-04-26T17:21:00.000Z	lamothe	daniel_hh	That will change the default, maybe it's the way you are calling it.
2008-04-26T17:23:00.000Z	daniel_hh	lamothe	I tried standard (firefox %s), as well as "firefox -P daniel %s", and also tried to configure "update-alternatives" .. but gnome is still starting opera ..?
2008-04-26T17:24:00.000Z	lamothe	daniel_hh	How are you starting it?
2008-04-26T17:28:00.000Z	daniel_hh	lamothe	I doubleclick a link on the desktop or a link in thunderbird .. then starts opera. Did you mean that? In "Prefered applications" is now a userdefined setting (firefox -P daniel %s).
2008-04-26T17:29:00.000Z	lamothe	daniel_hh	That's what I meant. Hmmm
2008-04-26T17:30:00.000Z	lamothe	daniel_hh	What happens when you type `firefox` on the command line?
2008-04-26T17:31:00.000Z	daniel_hh	lamothe	firefox starts
2008-04-26T17:31:00.000Z	daniel_hh	lamothe	i know .. strange
2008-04-26T17:32:00.000Z	daniel_hh	lamothe	does gnome has own settings somewhere?
2008-04-26T17:33:00.000Z	lamothe	daniel_hh	I thought that that's what you were changing.
2008-04-26T17:35:00.000Z	daniel_hh	lamothe	sure.. but these settings doesn't seem to help :(
2008-04-26T17:37:00.000Z	lamothe	daniel_hh	If you haven't already, can I recommend logging out/in.  Maybe gconf is stuck.
2008-04-26T17:41:00.000Z	daniel_hh	lamothe	I allread restarted X and the computer
2008-04-26T18:02:00.000Z	daniel_hh	lamothe	thanks for your time anyway. I just found a solution: I renamed /usr/bin/opera -> /usr/bin/opera9 .. and now it opens firefox *wonder*
2008-04-26T18:07:00.000Z	lamothe	daniel_hh	Ha, go figure.
