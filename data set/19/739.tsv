2012-01-02T19:22:00.000Z	D_Russ		hello all. why is large file transfer slow on ubuntu? is there some settings i need to change?
2012-01-02T19:23:00.000Z	D_Russ		what is rsync and cp? MonkeyDust?
2012-01-02T19:24:00.000Z	D_Russ		i am transfering an 8gb file from my camcorder to my HDD via usb and i am only getting 7mb/sec transfer speeds is this about right?
2012-01-02T19:25:00.000Z	D_Russ		ohh i c
2012-01-02T19:26:00.000Z	D_Russ		so i have only the option of accepting the transfer speeds or learn to use the terminal for transfering large files?
2012-01-02T19:28:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	D_Russ	There is a GUI version of the terminal command rsync; it's called Grsync and should be in your repositories.
2012-01-02T19:30:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	D_Russ	My pleasure; but I doubt it'll speed up your transfer rate; Grsync is what I use to back-up my data. :-)
2012-01-02T19:32:00.000Z	D_Russ	Sidewinder1	so the transfer rates i am seeing is normal for linux with large files? one thing good about windows is that it transfers large files pretty fast, so i was thinking maybe something was wrong on my install since i never really get the same transfer speeds even when using esata to transfer.
2012-01-02T19:35:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	D_Russ	Yes, eSATA is definately faster than USB2, in ubuntu or windows. I'm curious, are you saying that using the same hardware, win is faster, in transfer rates, than ubuntu?
2012-01-02T19:37:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	D_Russ	What program, in ubuntu, are you using to transfer?
2012-01-02T19:39:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	D_Russ	That's curious, I also run dual boot (with XP-Pro, but rarely use it, anymore), I've found the times to accomplish 'most' tasks to be very similiar..
2012-01-02T19:40:00.000Z	D_Russ	Sidewinder1	that is true, but i have noticed (win764bit) that file transfer is always faster on windows, i do prefer ubuntu by far but thats just one thing i would like to improve if possible
2012-01-02T19:41:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	D_Russ	Then, I would assume, that you're using the 64-bit ver. of ubuntu; which version, 11.10?
2012-01-02T19:42:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	D_Russ	I have an 'antique' desktop, and kinda' stick with LTS versions; currently running 10.04, and it works great!
2012-01-02T19:44:00.000Z	D_Russ	Sidewinder1	yeah i started out with 11.04 32 bit and decided to go with 64bit 11.10 since most people say 64bit works without issues now. my desktop is kind of a powerhouse (well sort of) so it just must be a filesystem type deal
2012-01-02T19:44:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	D_Russ	About the only real difference in speed, between win vs ubuntu, is when I use my Hauppague, usb, TV ... Much better in win... :-(
2012-01-02T19:48:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	D_Russ	Well, I wouldn't know anything about "7"'s transfer rates; just last night, I (in ubuntu) burned 695 MB, avi. video file to CD; took all on about 3 minutes; on this, circa 2003, Dell Desktop. :D
2012-01-02T19:50:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	D_Russ	OIC, Hi-def stuff..
2012-01-02T19:52:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	D_Russ	Same to you, sir!
