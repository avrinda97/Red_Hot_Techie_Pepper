2009-12-22T00:21:00.000Z	assargadon		Are there some easy, more or less user-friendly way to share ntfs drive?
2009-12-22T00:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	assargadon	  you mean set up a samba share? or share btween os's ?
2009-12-22T00:22:00.000Z	assargadon	Dr_Willis	yes, I mean samba share
2009-12-22T00:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	assargadon	 i just install samba and make a proper entry for it in the smb.conf  samba is the kind of tool thats worth learning well
2009-12-22T00:23:00.000Z	assargadon	Dr_Willis	yup, I know the different admin-ways. Two of them really.
2009-12-22T00:23:00.000Z	assargadon	Dr_Willis	Question is: if there are some user-friendly way I can explain to non-admins
2009-12-22T00:25:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	assargadon	 depends on what/how they want  to do shares. for sahreing stuff out of their own home dir. theres some share feature on the rioght click menu. PROBLEM with shareing a ntfs drive. is that you may need to tweak the permissions on the drive. and mount it via fstab  Not let it 'auto mount on access'
2009-12-22T00:27:00.000Z	assargadon	Dr_Willis	as far as I understand, there are no GUI way to modify the owner of the mounted disk?
2009-12-22T00:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	assargadon	 its best to just make a proper entry in the fstab.. dependin on how you want it owned.
2009-12-22T00:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	assargadon	 every ftab ediing gui ive ever seen.. had limitations/issues.. and i ended up just doing it by hand anyway
2009-12-22T00:29:00.000Z	assargadon	Dr_Willis	well, yes, it's common situation...hmmm...ok, anyway, thanks.
2009-12-22T00:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	assargadon	 untill not so long ago the use of ntfs-3g was very UNCOMMON. :)
2009-12-22T00:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	assargadon	  there is the ntfs-config tool that can add fstab entries i belive fro  ntfs/vfat filesystems
2009-12-22T00:32:00.000Z	assargadon	Dr_Willis	yes, I installed it manually in some earlier ubuntu version
2009-12-22T00:32:00.000Z	assargadon	Dr_Willis	but addin NTFS support REALLY helps to people to make decision to try ubuntu
2009-12-22T00:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	assargadon	 its been argued both ways and across the world ways..  ntfs-config tool does allow you do do a few clicks and enable full access to ntfs filesystems.   Or not allow any at all.
2009-12-22T00:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	assargadon	 personally during the install - i give my ntfs fs's a mountpoint so its rarely an issue for me.
2009-12-22T00:35:00.000Z	assargadon	Dr_Willis	you mean, your NTFS volumes are hard-mounted?
2009-12-22T00:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	assargadon	 i have entries for them in fstab, eitehr made by the installer, or by the ntfs-config tool.  if thats what yiou mean.
