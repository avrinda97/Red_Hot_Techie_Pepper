2007-10-29T06:28:00.000Z	nerdzyboy		What package do I need to install in order to enable the 'extra' visual effects? (it tells me that the composite extensions is not enabled)
2007-10-29T06:28:00.000Z	crdlb	nerdzyboy	video card?
2007-10-29T06:29:00.000Z	nerdzyboy		my video card supports them
2007-10-29T06:29:00.000Z	nerdzyboy		they were enabled when I ran from the cd
2007-10-29T06:31:00.000Z	nerdzyboy	crdlb	Any idea?
2007-10-29T06:31:00.000Z	crdlb	nerdzyboy	what video card?
2007-10-29T06:31:00.000Z	crdlb		it really does matter
2007-10-29T06:31:00.000Z	nerdzyboy	crdlb	Ati radeon 7200
2007-10-29T06:32:00.000Z	crdlb	nerdzyboy	did you enable the restricted driver somehow?
2007-10-29T06:33:00.000Z	nerdzyboy		yep
2007-10-29T06:33:00.000Z	crdlb	nerdzyboy	that would be the problem
2007-10-29T06:33:00.000Z	crdlb		fglrx (the restricted driver) doesn't support AIGLX, so you'd have to use Xgl
2007-10-29T06:34:00.000Z	nerdzyboy		So I just deactivate them?
2007-10-29T06:34:00.000Z	crdlb		yes
2007-10-29T06:35:00.000Z	nerdzyboy	crdlb	So I just deactivate them?
2007-10-29T06:36:00.000Z	crdlb	nerdzyboy	yes
2007-10-29T06:37:00.000Z	nerdzyboy	crdlb	What driver should I use then?
2007-10-29T06:38:00.000Z	crdlb	nerdzyboy	the default "ati" driver, which is what you were using on the livecd and is what you'll get if you disable the restricted driver
2007-10-29T06:38:00.000Z	nerdzyboy	crdlb	k thanks!
