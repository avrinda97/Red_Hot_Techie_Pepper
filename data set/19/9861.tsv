2006-09-03T13:58:00.000Z	digital	graffoo	I can't save the changes I made... it says that I do not have permission. How do I get around that?

2006-09-03T14:02:00.000Z	digital		ok, I've made my changes and saved... but my tablet still doesn't seem to be functioning correctly. Is there a guide somewhere I could refer to and save you guys the headache?
2006-09-03T14:07:00.000Z	graffoo	digital	you have to logout, hit ctrl+alt+backspace and then login. If you get an error, run xconfig and follow the onscreen instructions...
