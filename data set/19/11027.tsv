2006-05-05T15:29:00.000Z	ic56	darx	what kind of shutdown script?  is the standard shutdown program insufficient for your needs?
2006-05-05T15:30:00.000Z	darx	ic56	i'd like to release the lease and reset the saved leases
2006-05-05T15:30:00.000Z	darx	ic56	the DHCP leases
2006-05-05T15:32:00.000Z	darx	ic56	i'd like to release the DHCP lease and reset the saved leases
2006-05-05T15:33:00.000Z	ic56	darx	to cause a script to be executed during shutdown, put it in /etc/init.d and then link it to the /etc/rc?.d directories
2006-05-05T15:34:00.000Z	ic56	darx	the scripts in /etc/init.d have a specific format.  Make sure to immitate it -- you need to provide start, stop, and restart methods at minimum.
2006-05-05T15:34:00.000Z	darx	ic56	thanks buddy.
2006-05-05T15:35:00.000Z	darx	ic56	wouldn't a normal shell script suffice??
2006-05-05T15:35:00.000Z	ic56	darx	note the presence of /etc/init.d/networking .  To release your DHCP leases, it may be more appropriate to add your code in there.
2006-05-05T15:37:00.000Z	darx	ic56	as i said before i'd also like to reset the saved leases. ubuntu for somereason defaults to the expired leases
2006-05-05T15:51:00.000Z	darx	ic56	thanks a ton mate
2006-05-05T05:35:00.000Z	ic56	darx	you mean you want the file to continue existing but be empty?
2006-05-05T05:36:00.000Z	ic56	darx	in bash, type:  >file
2006-05-05T05:36:00.000Z	darx	ic56	thanks
2006-05-05T05:37:00.000Z	darx	ic56	i didn't follow your private message to me
2006-05-05T05:37:00.000Z	ic56	darx	you're welcome
