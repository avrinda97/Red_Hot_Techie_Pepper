2008-04-08T16:12:00.000Z	elusif		i plan to put my first linux installation on a western digital raptor 150g 10,000 rpm hdd - is there any reason i shouldn't do this?
2008-04-08T16:13:00.000Z	elusif		frogzoo - how do i do this?
2008-04-08T16:15:00.000Z	DistroJockey	elusif	can't see why there would be any problem (btw, that'll fly :) )
2008-04-08T16:16:00.000Z	DistroJockey	elusif	:)
2008-04-08T16:17:00.000Z	DistroJockey	elusif	always good to make sure you can do what you need :)
2008-04-08T16:18:00.000Z	DistroJockey	elusif	the root of everything
2008-04-08T16:19:00.000Z	DistroJockey	elusif	if you can wait 16 days, get Hardy
2008-04-08T16:20:00.000Z	DistroJockey	elusif	8.04 that is
2008-04-08T16:22:00.000Z	elusif	DistroJockey	why, will updating from 8.03 to hardy be a pain?
2008-04-08T16:23:00.000Z	DistroJockey	elusif	from 8.04 beta to release, may have many updates
2008-04-08T16:23:00.000Z	DistroJockey	elusif	but should work (but I always prefer clean installs)
2008-04-08T16:30:00.000Z	elusif	DistroJockey	ok i will wait for 8.04 - but i am install linux this time! :) ty
2008-04-08T16:30:00.000Z	DistroJockey	elusif	you're welcome. It will be worth the wait :)
2008-04-08T16:32:00.000Z	DistroJockey	elusif	the installer should do the partitioning right. I suggest disconnecting the Windows drive and installing on the raptor
2008-04-08T16:33:00.000Z	DistroJockey	elusif	then after you have installed Ubuntu, you can plug the Windows drive in and tell Grub from the Ubuntu install where to boot Windows from. (nice way to dual boot)
2008-04-08T16:47:00.000Z	DistroJockey	elusif	install ubuntu, shutdown, then reconnect the Windows drive and boot into ubuntu to change grub
2008-04-08T16:53:00.000Z	DistroJockey	elusif	tactikalnuke: this may be worth a look re. grub ;) :  http://users.bigpond.net.au/hermanzone/p15.htm
2008-04-08T17:11:00.000Z	elusif	DistroJockey	many thanks, i will install on 24 april when 8.04 is out :)
2008-04-08T17:11:00.000Z	DistroJockey	elusif	you're welcome. Sounds like the best idea
