2011-12-12T07:26:00.000Z	bonhoffer		how do i see what usb devices are connected?
2011-12-12T07:26:00.000Z	Gaming4JC	bonhoffer	go to a terminal and type "lsusb"
2011-12-12T07:26:00.000Z	Gaming4JC		:)
2011-12-12T07:26:00.000Z	bonhoffer	Gaming4JC	not found
2011-12-12T07:26:00.000Z	bonhoffer		package?
2011-12-12T07:26:00.000Z	Gaming4JC	bonhoffer	hmm... let me check
2011-12-12T07:27:00.000Z	Gaming4JC	bonhoffer	yeah they may have done away with the package in newer versions. lspci is for pcis and should still be there... Wikipedia has it https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lsusb
2011-12-12T07:28:00.000Z	bonhoffer		no ls-psci -- anyway i'm trying to set up a scanner -- just curious if it is connected
2011-12-12T07:29:00.000Z	Gaming4JC	bonhoffer	What version of ubuntu are you using? SimpleScan should work out of the box.
2011-12-12T07:29:00.000Z	bonhoffer		11.10
2011-12-12T07:29:00.000Z	bonhoffer		yeah -- no scanners detected from that app
2011-12-12T07:29:00.000Z	bonhoffer		i have virtualbox with windows to load the scanner software
2011-12-12T07:30:00.000Z	Gaming4JC	bonhoffer	and you have the virtualbox extras installed to enable usb?
2011-12-12T07:30:00.000Z	Gaming4JC		it's a package from the VBox website
2011-12-12T07:31:00.000Z	bonhoffer		not sure -i'll get that -- i have guest additions, do i need more?
2011-12-12T07:31:00.000Z	bonhoffer		anyway -- it would be good to know what linux sees
2011-12-12T07:34:00.000Z	Gaming4JC	bonhoffer	yes the extension pack via http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/4.1.6/Oracle_VM_VirtualBox_Extension_Pack-4.1.6-74713.vbox-extpack   | and you also need to add yourself to the vbox usergroup. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VirtualBox#USB
2011-12-12T07:35:00.000Z	Gaming4JC	bonhoffer	I'm puzzled lsusb isn't working for you.
