2005-07-06T09:11:00.000Z	mikeworking		hello - my office wants me to have my /home (which is in a separate part.) as encrypted. Do I do this during install or afterwards? The idea is that if the laptop is stolen, the theif is strangely out of luck.
2005-07-06T09:11:00.000Z	mikeworking		Neo -- is that you Dee?
2005-07-06T09:12:00.000Z	mikeworking		Neo -- sorry, I have a friend installing Ubuntu for the first time tonight who is named Dee and has a handle of Neo.
2005-07-06T09:12:00.000Z	mikeworking		Anyway, anyone know how to do an encrypted /home partition to protect my laptop if stolen?
2005-07-06T09:13:00.000Z	PTK	mikeworking	I haven't done it myself but try the loopback crypto fs
2005-07-06T09:13:00.000Z	mikeworking	PTK	-- that's what my friend Alvaro from Brazil said to do. I'm not used to this "encrypted loopback".
2005-07-06T09:13:00.000Z	mikeworking		I shall Google now for it.
2005-07-06T09:14:00.000Z	mikeworking		Neo, lighten up. We can help.
2005-07-06T09:15:00.000Z	mikeworking		When you compose a msg, do you see a button called Attach at the top?
2005-07-06T09:15:00.000Z	PTK	mikeworking	http://www.flyn.org/docs/ehd.pdf <-- seems to be just what you need
2005-07-06T09:16:00.000Z	mikeworking		Okay, so Neo is having fun here. I get it. Always the last one to figure out stuff, I am.
2005-07-06T09:19:00.000Z	mikeworking		Yikes. This loopback encrypted filesystem -- that's a rat's nest of work.
2005-07-06T09:22:00.000Z	mikeworking		Okay guys, so if encrypt. loopback of a partition is a real pain, how hard is it to have some folders that are encrypted and I save my stuff to that? I need to protect the laptop's info in case of theft.
2005-07-06T09:26:00.000Z	mikeworking		Hi. I need real help with my encryption question and I'm looking for the short solution that works fast on a day by day basis. The encrypted loopback part. looks great, but is too time-consuming to implement.
2005-07-06T09:27:00.000Z	PTK	mikeworking	are u looking at the device mapper way from the ubuntu wiki or the loopback fs way?
2005-07-06T09:31:00.000Z	mikeworking		Oh. Hi, PTK. Was reading Google a moment. I'm back. And same to you bimberi... thanks.
2005-07-06T09:32:00.000Z	mikeworking		How do I put bimberi and PTK in a new chat window from the rest? (X-Chat)
2005-07-06T09:32:00.000Z	PTK	mikeworking	not sure u can
2005-07-06T09:32:00.000Z	PTK	mikeworking	take a look at the wiki bimberi mentioned though, it looks long but fairly detailed
