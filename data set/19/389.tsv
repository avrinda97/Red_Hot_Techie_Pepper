2012-03-13T04:17:00.000Z	whatasunnyday		Maybe I should rephrase my question to be a little less wordy and disorganized.
2012-03-13T04:19:00.000Z	whatasunnyday		If I want to make my ubuntu partition say, 20 gigs, say 20 for my OS install and 20 for my home folder, how should I seperate the partitions? Should it be 1 40 gb primary with two logical? Or two seperate 20s? What do I set as the mount points?
2012-03-13T04:20:00.000Z	whatasunnyday		should they both be logical?
2012-03-13T04:20:00.000Z	whatasunnyday		and they both be ext 4?
2012-03-13T04:20:00.000Z	whatasunnyday		i'm not sure what this begining/end business means
2012-03-13T04:20:00.000Z	jbrks	whatasunnyday	linux doesnt care if its pri or logical--
2012-03-13T04:19:00.000Z	jbrks	whatasunnyday	make it easy.. just use 1 "/" and 1 for "swap"
2012-03-13T04:20:00.000Z	jbrks	whatasunnyday	minimum u need is 2
2012-03-13T04:20:00.000Z	jbrks	whatasunnyday	how many other partitionsare there?
2012-03-13T04:21:00.000Z	jbrks	whatasunnyday	a waste of disk space.. simply use "/"
2012-03-13T04:22:00.000Z	jbrks	whatasunnyday	make the swap twice the size of your ram
2012-03-13T04:22:00.000Z	jbrks	whatasunnyday	doesnt make it any safer..
2012-03-13T04:23:00.000Z	jbrks	whatasunnyday	as a beginner make it simple.. just use 2 partitions.. makes it easier to work with
2012-03-13T04:23:00.000Z	whatasunnyday	jbrks	i am actually trying to move up from the beginnner point. i have been using linux for just under a year. using mint exclusivel.
2012-03-13T04:23:00.000Z	jbrks	whatasunnyday	there also isnt much speed gain-- its only for server there is speed gain.. (log seperation etc)
2012-03-13T04:24:00.000Z	whatasunnyday	jbrks	that's my only concern, upgrades
2012-03-13T04:24:00.000Z	jbrks	whatasunnyday	i upgrade a 10.x to 11.x -- didnt have issues really
2012-03-13T04:26:00.000Z	jbrks	whatasunnyday	you're wasting time.. because a linux standard desktop usually isnt more than 7 gigs.. and you're throwing it on a 40 gig partition
2012-03-13T04:40:00.000Z	jbrks	whatasunnyday	windows works best on the first partition(and make it a primary)
