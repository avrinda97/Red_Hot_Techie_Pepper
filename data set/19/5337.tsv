2008-07-20T05:27:00.000Z	tcz		Im having some problems since upgrading to hardy, scrolling in firefox is choppy, video playback is laggy, the whole gnome interface is laggy, tried to mess with the ati/open source video drivers and the x config to no avail. Any ideas? google found several similar cases but i didnt find any solution.
2008-07-20T05:28:00.000Z	bazhang	tcz	what processor how much ram; what video card and how were drivers installed; any third party repos or scripts in use
2008-07-20T05:32:00.000Z	tcz	bazhang	ï»¿Athlon xp 2600+ 2gb ram ati Radeon 9600, fresh out of a format/clean install i had the problem, tried enabling the restricted drivers, tried using envy... all the same, 3d acceleration seems on
2008-07-20T05:33:00.000Z	bazhang	tcz	envy or envyng-gtk
2008-07-20T05:33:00.000Z	tcz	bazhang	envyng-gtk
2008-07-20T05:34:00.000Z	bazhang	tcz	what resolution; you using any third party repos? what about wine
2008-07-20T05:34:00.000Z	tcz	bazhang	the only thing that does help is disabling all effects in the appearances
2008-07-20T05:34:00.000Z	bazhang	tcz	how big a difference and what ati driver are you using
2008-07-20T05:35:00.000Z	tcz	bazhang	this is a fresh install I havent enabled anything yet that isnt on by default, res is 1600x1200 wine is not isntalled
2008-07-20T05:36:00.000Z	tcz	bazhang	huge difference actualy, but if i try to watch videos in full screen its laggy again
2008-07-20T05:36:00.000Z	bazhang	tcz	you know what driver? is the fglrx?
2008-07-20T05:36:00.000Z	bazhang	tcz	flash videos or regular movies
2008-07-20T05:36:00.000Z	tcz	bazhang	both, youtube full screen or an AVIs same thing
2008-07-20T05:37:00.000Z	tcz	bazhang	for the driver... hm... the one i have on now is whatever envyng installed, 8.6 i think
2008-07-20T05:38:00.000Z	bazhang	tcz	for flash either use youtube-dl to get them and play in vlc (flash is low res and will never look great) or miro which does flash fullscreen much better; for avi etc disable compiz etc while watching; you can get fusion-icon to do it with one click
2008-07-20T05:40:00.000Z	tcz	bazhang	ok ill try that thx
2008-07-20T05:41:00.000Z	tcz	bazhang	fyi in xorg.config it says  Driver  "fglrx"   seems allright, not sure whats going on, simple effects like this shouldnt mess up a radeon 9600 like that
2008-07-20T05:42:00.000Z	tcz	bazhang	anyways, thx for your work around :)
2008-07-20T05:45:00.000Z	tcz	bazhang	wow ... something is wrong with compiz, i switched the windows manager to metacity and everything is finaly running smooOOOth as silk! you made me a happy camper
