2007-04-17T09:32:00.000Z	CapaH		In general, what is the standard response that I should take if an application such as firefox stops responding, resulting in my ability only to move the mouse around the screen? CTRL+ALT+DELETE or something else?
2007-04-17T09:33:00.000Z	CapaH		... Nothing is working I can only move my mouse, any suggestions?
2007-04-17T09:33:00.000Z	tekm8	CapaH	does the caps lock key work?
2007-04-17T09:33:00.000Z	CapaH		tekm: apparently not
2007-04-17T09:34:00.000Z	CapaH		... I suppose reboot is the only option
2007-04-17T09:34:00.000Z	tekm8	CapaH	hrm, if the keyboard is unresponsive, try unplugging it and plugging it back in, otherwise it sounds like you might need to hard reboot
2007-04-17T09:37:00.000Z	CapaH	Lbawinowns	: They both said the same thing -- basically its safe/stable
2007-04-17T09:44:00.000Z	CapaH		Ok I have a peculiar problem, if I load firefox and I go to vmware.com --- the *entire* OS crashes (either on front page, or subsequent pages) --- has not happened on other sites. The only solution is a hard reboot... Ideas?
2007-04-17T09:45:00.000Z	tekm8	CapaH	wow, i'm gonna check that out
2007-04-17T09:45:00.000Z	CapaH		this is a fresh install, no time yet for new plugins -- and correct, cannot even switch to other consoles
2007-04-17T09:46:00.000Z	tekm8	CapaH	have you installed the updates?
2007-04-17T09:46:00.000Z	CapaH		tekm: yes
2007-04-17T09:47:00.000Z	tekm8	CapaH	hrm, that kinda blows my mind if you don't have any plugins installed and everything is updated...unless your screen settings aren't set right, or your graphics card isn't recognized correctly
2007-04-17T09:49:00.000Z	CapaH		tekm: It *could* be graphic card related, I am using an X800 --- any ideas?
2007-04-17T09:49:00.000Z	tekm8	CapaH	if those are correct, try deleting your preference files > it's the .mozilla folder in ~
2007-04-17T09:50:00.000Z	tekm8	CapaH	you might have a corrupted preference file or something...but still, i don't think it should cause the system to crash
2007-04-17T09:50:00.000Z	CapaH		update -- just crashed when I was browsing through screensavers --- so not firefox related
2007-04-17T09:50:00.000Z	CapaH		probably gfx card
2007-04-17T09:51:00.000Z	tekm8	CapaH	yeah, sounds like the card or the resolution settings or refresh rate
