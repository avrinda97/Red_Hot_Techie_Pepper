2011-05-05T02:11:00.000Z	LjL	MnCC	if you need to copy stuff outside of your home folder that often, you're Doing It WrongÂ©
2011-05-05T02:12:00.000Z	MnCC	LjL	not really ..you keep al your music and videos in your homefolder ?
2011-05-05T02:12:00.000Z	LjL	MnCC	yes? but even if i didn't, i'd keep them somewhere i have permissions to, obviously
2011-05-05T02:18:00.000Z	LjL	MnCC	and if you're worried about upgrades (or for that matter, if you aren't), you use a separate partition for /home
2011-05-05T02:18:00.000Z	MnCC	LjL	now were talking
2011-05-05T02:18:00.000Z	MnCC	LjL	how ?
2011-05-05T02:19:00.000Z	LjL	MnCC	well it's easier to do it during install than after, to be honest. you need gparted and a bit of console tinkering. shrink your / partition, make space for a /home partition, format it, copy everything from your old /home there, add the new /home to fstab, reboot, see if it works, if it works reboot into single user mode, delete stuff from old /home, done
2011-05-05T02:19:00.000Z	LjL	MnCC	i know unfortunately it's a bit involved if you do it after installing.
2011-05-05T02:20:00.000Z	MnCC	LjL	i have been trough bigger fires =)
2011-05-05T02:21:00.000Z	MnCC	LjL	create 2nd uer .. modify fstab .. mount under /home ?
2011-05-05T02:22:00.000Z	LjL	MnCC	uhm, usually it's the whole /home that's put on a separate partition, not just a single user's directory inside /home.
2011-05-05T02:22:00.000Z	LjL	MnCC	so you might as well keep the one user you have now, you just need to know how to deal with single user mode in case things go wrong
2011-05-05T02:23:00.000Z	MnCC	LjL	basicly boot into live and take it from there
2011-05-05T02:23:00.000Z	LjL	MnCC	that's another option
2011-05-05T02:23:00.000Z	LjL	MnCC	well, the only option if you need to resize the root partition to make space, really
2011-05-05T02:24:00.000Z	MnCC	LjL	thanks man .. back in a jiffy .. i hope ... =P
2011-05-05T03:21:00.000Z	MnCC	LjL	thanks a million =)
2011-05-05T03:21:00.000Z	LjL	MnCC	did it? :)
2011-05-05T03:22:00.000Z	MnCC	LjL	had some problems with gparted .. but im ok now =)
