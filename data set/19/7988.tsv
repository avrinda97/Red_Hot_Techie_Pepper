2007-08-27T13:34:00.000Z	Zara_thrustra		I have a problem, I have windows vista and would like to keep it as a secondary operating system while running ubuntu linux, but vista says it requires any other operating system to be installed on an NTFS partition, can I do this?
2007-08-27T13:34:00.000Z	faileas	Zara_thrustra	thats somewhat BSish
2007-08-27T13:35:00.000Z	Zara_thrustra	rockets	I've heard if you run vista it "eats" the other operating system, I thought it was bull but I don't want to take chances
2007-08-27T13:35:00.000Z	Zara_thrustra		so in this case
2007-08-27T13:35:00.000Z	Zara_thrustra		I'm trying to be carefull
2007-08-27T13:35:00.000Z	Zara_thrustra		It won't damage vista?
2007-08-27T13:35:00.000Z	Zara_thrustra		and vista won't damage it?
2007-08-27T13:36:00.000Z	Zara_thrustra		It came with the laptot
2007-08-27T13:36:00.000Z	Zara_thrustra		laptop, and since it's so expensive I don't want to remove it
2007-08-27T13:36:00.000Z	Zara_thrustra		in case it actually comes in handy
2007-08-27T13:37:00.000Z	Zara_thrustra		thanks parisi
2007-08-27T13:37:00.000Z	faileas	Zara_thrustra	as long as you don't use gparted on the vista partition. use vista's OWN partition manager to shrink, then install ubuntu on the new partition
2007-08-27T13:37:00.000Z	Zara_thrustra		I have lots of space parisi
2007-08-27T13:37:00.000Z	Zara_thrustra		I just got this laptop yesterday
2007-08-27T13:38:00.000Z	faileas	Zara_thrustra	one thing though. got a recovery partition?
2007-08-27T13:38:00.000Z	Zara_thrustra		yea faileas
2007-08-27T13:38:00.000Z	faileas	Zara_thrustra	grub might nuke it. i ALWAYS have problems with it.
2007-08-27T13:39:00.000Z	faileas	Zara_thrustra	wubi plays nice with recovery partitions. else check how to restore your OEM bootloader (like IBM R&R) BEFORE you install ubuntu
