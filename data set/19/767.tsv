2011-09-04T04:22:00.000Z	yekoms		okay, ive tried all i know, and i booted into a live CD and its distorted on desktop too.
2011-09-04T04:24:00.000Z	yekoms		i guess ubuntu dont line widescreen notebooks :P
2011-09-04T04:24:00.000Z	yekoms		i cant get that far.
2011-09-04T04:25:00.000Z	dr_willis	yekoms	 its more x/driver specific then ubuntu specfic.
2011-09-04T04:26:00.000Z	dr_willis	yekoms	 you may want to try the nomodeset option.
2011-12-21T21:05:00.000Z	dr_willis	yekoms	 whats your video chipset?
2011-12-21T21:06:00.000Z	dr_willis	yekoms	 the alt. or desktop cd both should install the same system
2011-12-21T21:06:00.000Z	dr_willis	yekoms	 distorted how?
2011-12-21T21:12:00.000Z	dr_willis	yekoms	 yes. you install the driver after you do tha tinstall
2011-12-21T21:12:00.000Z	yekoms	dr_willis	like the same window cut into 4 sections
2011-12-21T21:13:00.000Z	dr_willis	yekoms	 ive had to use the 'nomodeset' option in the past to get a useable desktop, then use the gui installer.
2012-10-05T05:26:00.000Z	dr_willis	yekoms	 thats possible. ;)
2012-10-05T05:28:00.000Z	yekoms	dr_willis	i dont think he cares.
2012-10-08T00:48:00.000Z	dr_willis	yekoms	 then he wanted sda not sda1
2012-10-08T00:50:00.000Z	yekoms	dr_willis	he installed windows after linux.
2012-10-08T00:52:00.000Z	dr_willis	yekoms	 /boot/ partition is 'normally' on the first of the HD for historical reasons.. its not really needee to be there with most mondern hardware..
2012-10-08T00:54:00.000Z	yekoms	dr_willis	how many people select IDE1/2/3 for a system drive? not your every day users.
2012-10-08T00:54:00.000Z	yekoms	dr_willis	he said he used it.
2012-10-08T00:54:00.000Z	dr_willis	yekoms	 its definatly doable..
