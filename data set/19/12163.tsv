2005-12-02T12:06:00.000Z	jabra		I would like to get some comments on a security tool I have been working on. I am wondering if any would like to take a look?
2005-12-02T12:07:00.000Z	synackuator	jabra	i would as long as it's open source
2005-12-02T12:07:00.000Z	jabra	synackuator	ya, http://pbnj.sf.net
2005-12-02T12:09:00.000Z	synackuator	jabra	so basically you're appending several nmap scans to one 'db' file
2005-12-02T12:09:00.000Z	jabra		sort of
2005-12-02T12:10:00.000Z	synackuator	jabra	or is there more to it?
2005-12-02T12:10:00.000Z	jabra		there is
2005-12-02T12:10:00.000Z	jabra		takes nmap scan to input for amap
2005-12-02T12:10:00.000Z	jabra		then uses regex on that output
2005-12-02T12:10:00.000Z	jabra		and takes the output to a csv file
2005-12-02T12:11:00.000Z	jabra		then is able to handle diffs on the csv
2005-12-02T12:11:00.000Z	synackuator		i suppose that could come in handy for info gathering / research
2005-12-02T12:11:00.000Z	jabra	synackuator	let me know if you try it out
2005-12-02T12:11:00.000Z	synackuator	jabra	i'll do that - i'm a tad drunk so i dunno how succesful i wil be tonite
2005-12-02T12:12:00.000Z	jabra		heh whenever you get a chance
2005-12-02T12:16:00.000Z	synackuator	jabra	your pork project looks cool too
2005-12-02T12:17:00.000Z	jabra	synackuator	thanks
2005-12-02T12:19:00.000Z	jabra	synackuator	let me know if you have any suggestions or any ideas about it
2005-12-02T12:20:00.000Z	synackuator	jabra	roger
