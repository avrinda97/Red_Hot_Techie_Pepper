2007-08-28T14:52:00.000Z	ProN00b		is there any application to export windows from my ubuntu box to my windows box over the network ?
2007-08-28T14:53:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	ProN00b	windows copy protection would kick in and it would not work
2008-02-12T21:02:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	ProN00b	It is not a problem if you are not giving shell access to untrusted people
2008-02-12T21:03:00.000Z	ProN00b	Jack_Sparrow	and ?
2008-02-12T21:03:00.000Z	ProN00b	Jack_Sparrow	think about people selling webspace or shell accounts...
2008-02-12T21:05:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	ProN00b	I am sure the patch will be out quickly ... they are working on it.. but for 99% of the users, it is not an issue.
2008-02-12T21:06:00.000Z	ProN00b	Jack_Sparrow	1% of all ubuntu users is a freaking huge lot, i think you are overestimating it now, but still it is an issue for alot of people
2008-02-12T21:07:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	ProN00b	this is not the discussion room, there is no fix yet, if you care to discuss it.. take it to offtopic
2008-03-08T00:10:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	ProN00b	try cd to folder.. and make uninstall
2008-03-08T00:11:00.000Z	ProN00b	Jack_Sparrow	no rule to make target uninstall
2008-03-08T00:15:00.000Z	ProN00b	Jack_Sparrow	any other idea how to remove something installed with make ?
2008-03-08T00:15:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	ProN00b	no
2008-04-20T19:34:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	ProN00b	HOw did you create it
2008-04-20T19:35:00.000Z	ProN00b	Jack_Sparrow	using gparted
2008-04-20T19:36:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	ProN00b	and after gparted created the partition it shows that much used? or that much or your total tb is not available
2008-04-20T19:37:00.000Z	ProN00b	Jack_Sparrow	gparted shows 7.53gb used, but when i rightklick it in /media it shows the real size gparted gave me too, and that 46gb are used
