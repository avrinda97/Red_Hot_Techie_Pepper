2007-08-28T05:21:00.000Z	Jamesinator		Hello, when I try to start the apache2 daemon I get this error: "apache2: bad user name www-data". Help, please?
2007-08-28T05:22:00.000Z	dho_ragus	Jamesinator	did you delete the www-data user from your system?
2007-08-28T05:22:00.000Z	Jamesinator	dho_ragus	I have no idea what went wrong, it was working previously
2007-08-28T05:23:00.000Z	dho_ragus	Jamesinator	you should try doing `sudo dpkg-reconfigure apache2`...
2007-08-28T05:23:00.000Z	dho_ragus	Jamesinator	i think that's the right command.  basically what that's saying is the www-data user doesn't exist, but it should've been created during install of apache.
2007-08-28T05:23:00.000Z	Jamesinator	dho_ragus	Thanks, I'll try that
2007-08-28T05:24:00.000Z	dho_ragus	Jamesinator	worst case you can add the user yourself then `chown -R www-data` on your web directory
2007-08-28T05:24:00.000Z	Jamesinator	dho_ragus	Yes, but it prompts me for a password and other stuff, so I don't know what Apache expects me to give it
2007-08-28T05:25:00.000Z	dho_ragus	Jamesinator	yeah, that's why i recommend the dpkg-reconfigure option.  not sure if the package is "apache2" or something else
2007-08-28T05:25:00.000Z	Jamesinator	dho_ragus	I just did the reconfigure command... It returned nothing and it didn't fix the problem
2007-08-28T05:26:00.000Z	dho_ragus	Jamesinator	try it with apache2.2-common instead of apache2
2007-08-28T05:26:00.000Z	Jamesinator	dho_ragus	Lol. james@james-ubuntu:/home$ sudo dpkg-reconfigure apache2.2-common returns: chown: `www-data': invalid user
2007-08-28T05:26:00.000Z	dho_ragus	Jamesinator	LOL
2007-08-28T05:27:00.000Z	Jamesinator	dho_ragus	I might just end up having to do a sudo dpkg --purge apache2 and rewrite my httpd.conf
2007-08-28T05:27:00.000Z	dho_ragus	Jamesinator	back up your conf before you undelete it
2007-08-28T05:28:00.000Z	dho_ragus	Jamesinator	on feisty my www-data user is #33
2007-08-28T05:28:00.000Z	dho_ragus	Jamesinator	same with gid
2007-08-28T05:28:00.000Z	Jamesinator	dho_ragus	Thanks for the tip, I backed up my conf files already. I'm just gonna blast away apache and remake everything though. :P
2007-08-28T05:33:00.000Z	Jamesinator	dho_ragus	Oh puh-LEEZE. After purging it through dpkg and then reinstalling it I still get an error where it expects the user to exist. I guess I can try blasting the common files too.
