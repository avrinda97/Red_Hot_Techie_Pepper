2007-05-30T05:21:00.000Z	ward_		(i'm on feisty should that mather)
2007-05-30T05:22:00.000Z	erUSUL	ward_	if you have the deb-src sources use apt-get source package
2007-05-30T05:24:00.000Z	ward_	erUSUL	lol i dunno what deb-src sources are
2007-05-30T05:26:00.000Z	erUSUL	ward_	in /etc/apt/sources.list lines begining with deb-src
2007-05-30T05:26:00.000Z	ward_	erUSUL	you mean i don't have just the directory on my system :s:s:s
2007-05-30T05:27:00.000Z	ward_	erUSUL	that was your answer to the question where it puts the sources right?
2007-08-25T05:22:00.000Z	ward_	erUSUL	thats software?
2007-08-25T05:25:00.000Z	erUSUL	ward_	your moba has two chipsets the VIA and a promise one both supported by linux afaik. if you configured a raid volume trough bios you have to check if dmraid support your conf to access the volume

2007-08-25T05:27:00.000Z	ward_	erUSUL	ty, i also found this: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FakeRaidHowto
2007-08-25T05:27:00.000Z	ward_	erUSUL	what do you think of that howto?
2007-08-25T05:29:00.000Z	erUSUL	ward_	thats the one i was looking for ;) if you already created a raid volume through Bios or from windows with asus utilities you will need dmraid to access the volume from linux
2007-08-25T05:31:00.000Z	ward_	erUSUL	ok thanx, i'm not sure i'm just asking for a friend i'm at, he wants to intall ubuntu but wasnt sure about raid support for his controller
2007-08-25T05:32:00.000Z	erUSUL	ward_	if he wants to use the raid only in linux it is better to not use fakeraid and use software raid
2007-08-25T05:33:00.000Z	ward_	erUSUL	no he wants multiboot with xp (he didnt like vista :p)
2007-08-25T05:33:00.000Z	ward_	erUSUL	i mean he's replacing vista with ubuntu :p
2007-08-25T05:34:00.000Z	erUSUL	ward_	world domination at our hands at last ;P
2007-08-25T05:34:00.000Z	ward_	erUSUL	anyway thanx for the fast help, i'm out :-)
