2011-07-31T05:02:00.000Z	ejo		because you don't mv x > y
2011-07-31T05:04:00.000Z	ejo		So no one knows about this problem with portrait-oriented monitors having subpixel text rendering problems (only in portrait orientation) --
2011-07-31T05:04:00.000Z	ejo		Or even where I should look first
2011-07-31T05:05:00.000Z	ejo		I'm just hoping for a suggestion on whether to first pursue the video card, the monitors, the driver, GDM, or what.
2011-07-31T05:05:00.000Z	bluezone	ejo	is your video card any good?
2011-07-31T05:07:00.000Z	bluezone	ejo	 did you just install ubuntu now?
2011-07-31T05:07:00.000Z	ejo	bluezone	a month ago
2011-07-31T05:09:00.000Z	bluezone	ejo	i can't say for sure, i heard that ati cards aren't well supported on lunux but that still shouldn't be the issue, i think it's a bug
2011-07-31T05:10:00.000Z	ejo	bluezone	thanks for your thoughts.  I just wish I knew if it was more likely to be a bug in... Xinerama... GDM... ATI's proprietary driver... or what
2011-07-31T05:10:00.000Z	bluezone	ejo	did you try not using proprietary drivers?
2011-07-31T05:11:00.000Z	ejo	bluezone	It looks like on standard drivers (non-proprietary) I can only run a 2-monitor desktop max.
2011-07-31T05:13:00.000Z	bluezone	ejo	my best guess is gnome have you tried uhh, if i remember correctly i think it's metacity --replace or something? give me a min
2011-07-31T05:13:00.000Z	ejo	bluezone	ooh okay, will gladly try any suggestion
2011-07-31T05:14:00.000Z	bluezone	ejo	ah they changed it, terrible, DOES anyone know the code to reload gnome?
2011-07-31T05:15:00.000Z	ejo	bluezone	I think I see what you're getting at... that would be great if simply reloading the display manager or window manager (now that my monitor configuration is as i want it) would fix this.
2011-07-31T05:15:00.000Z	ejo	bluezone	Incidentally I am using classic Gnome.  This configuration crashes Linux under Unity.
2011-07-31T05:17:00.000Z	bluezone	ejo	well every time i have wierd problems like this i usually reinstall or do this http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/linux/reload-the-gnome-or-kde-panels-without-restarting/
2011-07-31T05:17:00.000Z	ejo	bluezone	Thanks, I'll give that a look.
2011-07-31T05:19:00.000Z	ejo	bluezone	Oh.  Well all that is is restarting the window manager without having to reboot.  Since reboots don't solve my problem, that won't either.  But thank you!
