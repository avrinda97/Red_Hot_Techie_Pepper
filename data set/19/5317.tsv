2009-05-29T08:34:00.000Z	scales11		well i was only using 7.10 because i needed the older version of gcc to compile a driver...can i get an older version of gcc with jaunty and use it?
2009-05-29T08:34:00.000Z	scales11		umm
2009-05-29T08:36:00.000Z	scales11		or if someone could help me, i am trying to compile this driver http://zd1211.wiki.sourceforge.net/VendorBasedDriver
2009-05-29T08:36:00.000Z	scales11		rather than the current gcc 4.4
2009-05-29T08:38:00.000Z	scales11		well now i am installing 9.04
2009-05-29T08:39:00.000Z	jtaji	scales11	or you could use the alternatives system... sudo update-alternatives --config cc
2009-05-29T08:39:00.000Z	scales11	jtaji	?
2009-05-29T08:39:00.000Z	jtaji	scales11	it's an answer to your last question
2009-05-29T08:40:00.000Z	jtaji	scales11	it will let you select the gcc version called by gcc when you have multiple versions installed
2009-05-29T09:25:00.000Z	jtaji	scales11	yeah I was wrong, that would let you select among different compilers, but not among different gcc versions
2009-05-29T09:25:00.000Z	jtaji	scales11	I guess try setting the CC environment variable as jrib suggested before
2009-05-29T09:26:00.000Z	scales11	jtaji	that was CC=gcc-4.1
2009-05-29T09:26:00.000Z	scales11	jtaji	but where do i use that?
2009-05-29T09:29:00.000Z	jtaji	scales11	you could set it in your shell before you run the configure script
2009-05-29T09:29:00.000Z	jtaji	scales11	another option would be changing the /usr/bin/gcc link to point to gcc-4.1 instead of gcc-4.3
2009-05-29T09:29:00.000Z	jtaji	scales11	do 'ls -l /usr/bin/gcc' and you'll see what I mean
2009-05-29T09:30:00.000Z	scales11	jtaji	how to i point it to the older version?
2009-05-29T09:32:00.000Z	jtaji	scales11	export CC=/usr/bin/gcc-4.1
2009-05-29T09:45:00.000Z	scales11	jtaji	i am lost, how to i tell it to make with a speficif version of gcc?
