2011-03-18T09:10:00.000Z	raido	EClaesson	Paste the output of "uname -a"

2011-03-18T09:11:00.000Z	raido	EClaesson	You have a 64 bit install runnint there. You are 64bit
2011-03-18T09:12:00.000Z	EClaesson	raido	But i am pretty sure this is a 32-bit pc
2011-03-18T09:13:00.000Z	raido	EClaesson	Nope, your 64. What kind of proc is it
2011-03-18T09:13:00.000Z	raido	EClaesson	Yep, 64 for sure
2011-03-18T09:14:00.000Z	raido	EClaesson	lol, learn sumptin new every day
2011-03-18T09:14:00.000Z	EClaesson	raido	Seriously. Can i somehow test that this really really is a 64 bit machine?
2011-03-18T09:14:00.000Z	raido	EClaesson	P.S. you already have grub installed
2011-03-18T09:15:00.000Z	raido	EClaesson	Dude, youre running a 64 bit kernel. All Intel procs since Core 2 Duo are 64bit
2011-03-18T09:15:00.000Z	EClaesson	raido	Ol thanks. Sorry for my.. confusion
2011-03-18T09:16:00.000Z	raido	EClaesson	See that part of uname -a that says x86_64
2011-03-18T09:18:00.000Z	EClaesson	raido	I know i can. The problem is that i just been so sure it's a 32-bit. And i know my way around computers..
2011-03-18T09:19:00.000Z	raido	EClaesson	LOL, so, for all the naysayers that poopoo 64bit Linux as not ready, you just proved them all FOS
2011-03-18T09:24:00.000Z	raido	EClaesson	Very good in my exp
