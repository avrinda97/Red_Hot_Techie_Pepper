2008-05-06T20:44:00.000Z	o0Chris0o		does Ubuntu install anything for KDE when gnome is selected?
2008-05-06T20:45:00.000Z	fde	o0Chris0o	No.
2008-05-06T20:47:00.000Z	fde	o0Chris0o	Because it lists all applications in the repo via that tool... although by default only supported apps.
2008-05-06T20:48:00.000Z	fde	o0Chris0o	ubuntu/kubuntu/edubuntu/xubuntu etc are actually all the same distro, they simply have different default package sets...
2008-05-06T20:49:00.000Z	o0Chris0o	fde	yeah I understand that much, I just thought if I got ubuntu with gnome, it will only list ubuntu, with gnome apps
2008-05-06T20:50:00.000Z	fde	o0Chris0o	Nope, you are free to install anything you want on Ubuntu... default install is just to get you started  :)
2008-05-07T06:32:00.000Z	fde	o0Chris0o	'sudo aptitude install ubuntu-restricted-extras'
2008-05-11T00:08:00.000Z	fde	o0Chris0o	sudo aptitude install sun-java6-plugin
2008-05-11T00:29:00.000Z	fde	o0Chris0o	what is it?
2008-05-11T00:30:00.000Z	fde	o0Chris0o	try running it with wine, else it won't work.
2008-05-13T12:47:00.000Z	fde	o0Chris0o	Cuz of what you told him probably... that is a dirty way to do things... should only be used if X locks up.
2008-05-13T12:50:00.000Z	fde	o0Chris0o	I didn't say you're a dirty person... heh... just that that is a dirty way to restart X... should never be needed... either log out and back in, or restart the process itself...
2008-05-13T12:51:00.000Z	o0Chris0o	fde	:) I know just j/k isnt restarting x the same way as loging out and loging back in, since thats what it is doing basicly
2008-05-13T13:47:00.000Z	fde	o0Chris0o	Ubuntu is so popular because they aren't rigidly against non-free things as a whole...
2008-05-13T13:47:00.000Z	fde	o0Chris0o	infact there is restricted and multiverse explicitly for non-free things.
2008-05-13T13:48:00.000Z	o0Chris0o	fde	true, I can't wait till go buntu comes out, Id like to test it :)
2008-05-13T13:49:00.000Z	fde	o0Chris0o	It was released at the same time as Ubuntu... it's just Ubuntu without restricted or multiverse enabled.
2008-05-13T13:50:00.000Z	o0Chris0o	fde	^
2008-05-13T13:50:00.000Z	fde	o0Chris0o	yes it is.
