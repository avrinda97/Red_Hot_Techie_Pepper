2008-05-14T23:20:00.000Z	MasseR		Is there a way to disable the emergency x server?
2008-05-14T23:20:00.000Z	MasseR		It breaks everything
2008-05-14T23:20:00.000Z	MasseR		I was trying to get two monitors working, but whenever I had faulty xorg.conf it broke everything
2008-05-14T23:21:00.000Z	MasseR		It doesn't listen to any keyboard commands
2008-05-14T23:22:00.000Z	jetsaredim	MasseR	what kind of card(s) are you using?
2008-05-14T23:22:00.000Z	MasseR	jetsaredim	Don't laugh. Ati
2008-05-14T23:23:00.000Z	jetsaredim	MasseR	which ati driver are you using?
2008-05-14T23:23:00.000Z	MasseR	jetsaredim	Both ati and fglrx
2008-05-14T23:23:00.000Z	jetsaredim		open or closed
2008-05-14T23:23:00.000Z	jetsaredim		take a look at the gentoo wiki
2008-05-14T23:23:00.000Z	jetsaredim		err MasseR: take a look at the gentoo wiki article on dual monitors
2008-05-14T23:24:00.000Z	MasseR	jetsaredim	The problem is that I did get two monitors to 'work' but even though I had 2560x800 the second monitor was 1024x768 and the first one 1280x800
2008-05-14T23:24:00.000Z	MasseR		Therefore it got squashed horizontally and was left out vertically
2008-05-14T23:25:00.000Z	jetsaredim	MasseR	it really depends on how your xorg.conf is setup and what your monitors will support
2008-05-14T23:25:00.000Z	MasseR	jetsaredim	yep. i had it working with that setup on 7.10
2008-05-14T23:25:00.000Z	jetsaredim	MasseR	I found with my nvidia dual head setup - it was almost easier to get working if I wrote the entire xorg.conf file by hand rather than use the tools
2008-05-14T23:25:00.000Z	MasseR	jetsaredim	Not much different than what I did eventually :)
2008-05-14T23:28:00.000Z	jetsaredim	MasseR	check out http://www.gentoo-wiki.com/HOWTO_Dual_Monitors#ATI
2008-05-14T23:33:00.000Z	MasseR	jetsaredim	Thanks I'll check it out
