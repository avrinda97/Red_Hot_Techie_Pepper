2010-05-08T10:39:00.000Z	silv3r_m00n		all my partitions are in gb .......114 gb * 4
2010-05-08T10:39:00.000Z	silv3r_m00n		then it would probably take weeks
2010-05-08T10:39:00.000Z	silv3r_m00n		I installed ubuntu on the first partition , and now need to install windows , is that possible ?
2010-05-08T10:39:00.000Z	Gartral	silv3r_m00n	thats still a bad idea.. think of the liklyhood of a specific partition randomly failing versus if the entire disk fails.. which happens all too often
2010-05-08T10:40:00.000Z	Gartral	silv3r_m00n	yes.. just a pain
2010-05-08T10:41:00.000Z	Gartral	silv3r_m00n	it;s just one extra step
2010-05-08T10:44:00.000Z	Gartral	silv3r_m00n	well.. yes there is.. is your /home on it's own partition?
2010-05-08T10:45:00.000Z	Gartral	silv3r_m00n	you should get into the habbit of doing that..
2010-05-08T10:45:00.000Z	silv3r_m00n	Gartral	I am new to this , can you explain this a bit ?
2010-05-08T10:46:00.000Z	Gartral	silv3r_m00n	i put swap in the "middle"ish part of the drive and build around it, starting with / /boot /home and /tmp
2010-05-08T10:47:00.000Z	Gartral	silv3r_m00n	yes. cause i swap my os alot, i like only really having to change just a small bit of data
2010-05-08T10:48:00.000Z	silv3r_m00n	Gartral	can you explain that further
2010-05-08T10:50:00.000Z	Gartral	silv3r_m00n	no.. Linux describes a MASSIVE range of hundred of seperate flavors or distributions.. i use windows for gaming, and keep a FAT32 "bitlocker" partition. or just inject from linux into windows (as theres no etx4 driver for windows yet, i cant go vise-versa)
2010-05-08T10:51:00.000Z	Gartral	silv3r_m00n	a partition thats formatted to fat32.. names bitlocker :P
2010-05-08T10:53:00.000Z	Gartral	silv3r_m00n	forefox has it's own font settings..
2010-05-08T10:53:00.000Z	silv3r_m00n	Gartral	ya , played enough with them , before the upgrade firefox looked perfect , better than windows , but after upgrade , its useless
2010-05-08T10:54:00.000Z	silv3r_m00n	Gartral	btw which windows do you use for gaming ? xp vista or 7 ?
2010-05-08T10:54:00.000Z	Gartral	silv3r_m00n	odd.. lucid is very new and buggy.. right now.. my lucid doesnt even BOOT so..
2010-05-08T10:54:00.000Z	Gartral	silv3r_m00n	pm
