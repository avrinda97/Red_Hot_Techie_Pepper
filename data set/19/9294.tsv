2009-05-21T08:16:00.000Z	Frijolie		my laptop sits idle and the system monitor says that both of my CPUs are ~50%
2009-05-21T08:16:00.000Z	Frijolie		how do you tell what's sucking up most of my clock cycles?
2009-05-21T08:16:00.000Z	phoenixz	Frijolie	system monitor, or in a text console, try "top"
2009-05-21T08:16:00.000Z	Frijolie	phoenixz	in the processes tab the most that it says is 7% and it's nautilus
2009-05-21T08:19:00.000Z	phoenixz	Frijolie	oh boy.. using intel GPU?
2009-05-21T08:19:00.000Z	Frijolie	phoenixz	yes
2009-05-21T08:20:00.000Z	phoenixz	Frijolie	no, X is a nice lean mean machine.. problem is that 9.04 has some borked up intel GPU driverss
2009-05-21T08:22:00.000Z	Frijolie	phoenixz	are they going to get those "borked" Intel drivers fixed shortly?
2009-05-21T08:23:00.000Z	phoenixz	Frijolie	Its a work in progress afaik.. I resolved it myself with switching to a 2.6.30 kernel (you are at 2.6.28 atm)
2009-05-21T08:23:00.000Z	Frijolie	phoenixz	i followed Intel Performance tutorial in the forums and got Compiz working again
2009-05-21T08:23:00.000Z	Frijolie	phoenixz	got some rc kernel or something
2009-05-21T08:27:00.000Z	phoenixz	Frijolie	Barridus: but not that much, thats not normal
2009-05-21T08:30:00.000Z	Frijolie	phoenixz	alright, shall I roll everything back? I have proposed repos selected...
2009-05-21T08:32:00.000Z	phoenixz	Frijolie	I'm trying to find the page again that I applied
2009-05-21T08:32:00.000Z	Frijolie	phoenixz	alright...no hurry
2009-05-21T08:32:00.000Z	phoenixz	Frijolie	duh, right under my face.. you already gave me the URL! :) http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1130582&highlight=Intel
2009-05-21T08:33:00.000Z	phoenixz	Frijolie	 dunno which of the 4 solutions you tried, but I tried the one with kernel 2.6.30 and it works like a charm for me.. NO GUARANTEES THOUGH!
2009-05-21T08:34:00.000Z	Frijolie	phoenixz	yeah that's the one that I tried and upgraded to the .30rc kernel that got Compiz working again but that's also when my lappy began to run hot
2009-05-21T08:34:00.000Z	phoenixz	Frijolie	ups..
