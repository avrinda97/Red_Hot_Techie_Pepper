2005-04-25T06:12:00.000Z	nate		the Groupwise <--> Palm <--> Evolution conversion loses some information
2005-04-25T06:12:00.000Z	nate		but as long as I use only a subset of features it *might* hold together
2005-04-25T06:13:00.000Z	nate		and the US sort of picked a middle path between secrecy and openness
2005-04-25T06:14:00.000Z	nate		all atomic research is still 'born classified' but fortunately stuff like TCP/IP wasn't. :)
2005-04-25T06:15:00.000Z	nate		the Soviets went the path of complete secrecy and it stuffed their economic base
2005-04-25T06:15:00.000Z	Jimbob	nate	No, 40% of the GDP being spent on the military stuffed their economic base (tanks & soldiers arent' too productive in the economic sense of the world)
2005-04-25T06:16:00.000Z	nate	Jimbob	that too
2005-04-25T06:16:00.000Z	Jimbob	nate	That only. :-)
2005-04-25T06:16:00.000Z	nate	Jimbob	what % of GDP does the USA spend on weapons, for comparison?
2005-04-25T06:16:00.000Z	Jimbob	nate	$600bn / $12tn
2005-04-25T06:18:00.000Z	Jimbob		Amazingly there actually is a #politics
2005-04-25T06:18:00.000Z	nate	Jimbob	Only 5%? Hmm, not bad toys for that kind of money.
2005-04-25T06:19:00.000Z	Jimbob	nate	0.5% (one half of one percent)
2005-04-25T06:20:00.000Z	Jimbob	nate	Well, California alone is the world's fifth largest economy.
