2008-06-06T09:46:00.000Z	petom0		is there a way to boot the dsl-linux off of a usb drive?
2008-06-06T09:47:00.000Z	petom0		i'd rather do that, than dig through all my supposedly blank CDs
2008-06-06T09:47:00.000Z	Gavin[newbuntu]	petom0	you can put almost any distro on a usb drive ala live cd
2008-06-06T09:47:00.000Z	Gavin[newbuntu]	petom0	in fact i did ubuntu that way since my cd drive didnt seem to work
2008-06-06T09:48:00.000Z	Gavin[newbuntu]	petom0	hold for the url

2008-06-06T09:49:00.000Z	Gavin[newbuntu]	petom0	just make sure you follow it exactly, i made a mistake and spent 2 hours trying to figure out why gnome kept reloading every time it would log in to the live desktop
2008-06-06T10:01:00.000Z	Gavin[newbuntu]	petom0	do you get an error?
2008-06-06T10:02:00.000Z	Gavin[newbuntu]	petom0	if it just pauses for a second or so, then puts you back at the prompt, it actually did work. i was confused about this as well.
2008-06-06T10:02:00.000Z	Gavin[newbuntu]	petom0	yes it seems to be invisible, even with show hidden files i couldn't see it myself
2008-06-06T10:02:00.000Z	Gavin[newbuntu]	petom0	but it worked anyway
2008-06-06T10:03:00.000Z	Gavin[newbuntu]	petom0	it doesn't matter if you run it multiple times... it only puts it in once...
2008-06-06T10:04:00.000Z	Gavin[newbuntu]	petom0	i mean its not like you will have 12 syslinuxes in there
2008-06-06T10:04:00.000Z	Gavin[newbuntu]	petom0	but as long as you formatted as FAT32 to being with, you should be OK
2008-06-06T10:08:00.000Z	Gavin[newbuntu]	petom0	what file?
2008-06-06T10:08:00.000Z	Gavin[newbuntu]	petom0	lol :)
2008-06-06T10:09:00.000Z	Gavin[newbuntu]	petom0	probably :P
2008-06-06T10:10:00.000Z	Gavin[newbuntu]	petom0	of course i used a new cd and it wouldnt boot anyway
2008-06-06T10:10:00.000Z	Gavin[newbuntu]	petom0	nah i got it working the usb drive... my cd drive was dumb
