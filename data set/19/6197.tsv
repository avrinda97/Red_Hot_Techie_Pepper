2009-05-02T16:46:00.000Z	trece8		good... now my video works... my speakers don't
2009-05-02T16:47:00.000Z	trece8		one thing.... just for knowing
2009-05-02T16:47:00.000Z	trece8		Installing the nvidia VIDEO driver to linux-rt makes the sliders of the AUDIO VOLUME down
2009-05-02T16:47:00.000Z	trece8		BIZARRE!!!!
2009-05-02T16:47:00.000Z	trece8		i don't know what the sound volumes have anything to do with the video driver!

2009-05-02T16:49:00.000Z	trece8		good, archman, that's the spirit!
2009-05-02T16:49:00.000Z	trece8		how do i start conky?
2009-05-02T16:50:00.000Z	archman	trece8	can i somehow make Synaptic to use xterm over gnome-ternimal?
2009-05-02T16:50:00.000Z	trece8		synaptic is a GUI, archman
2009-05-02T16:50:00.000Z	trece8		you can use aptitude for that, i assume
2009-05-02T16:50:00.000Z	trece8	Ziw	and auto-start?
2009-05-02T16:50:00.000Z	archman	trece8	i know, but you can view the install progression by clicking that "show in terminal or so"
2009-05-02T16:50:00.000Z	trece8		gotcha
2009-05-02T16:51:00.000Z	trece8		I think i misunderstood you, archman
2009-05-02T16:51:00.000Z	trece8		I don't know that, archman
2009-05-02T16:51:00.000Z	archman	trece8	ok cheers!
