2012-08-13T22:08:00.000Z	Beryllium		So, is there any way in Ubuntu to assign an extra IP address to the loopback interface?
2012-08-13T22:08:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	Beryllium	Yes, in /etc/network/interfaces.
2012-08-13T22:09:00.000Z	Beryllium	Psi-Jack	I am having a hard time finding an example of exactly what needs to be entered there to enable it (preferably without rendering the network subsystem unusable :) - hence my reluctance to experiment without a clear baseline to work from)
2012-08-13T22:09:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	Beryllium	What is it exactly you are trying to do?
2012-08-13T22:12:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	Beryllium	So a public VIP?
2012-08-13T22:13:00.000Z	Beryllium	Psi-Jack	I'll do a pastebin, just a sec
2012-08-13T22:15:00.000Z	Beryllium	Psi-Jack	Consulting with someone at work first, if we still can't solve it I'll bring it up with a pastebin :)
2012-08-13T22:36:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	Beryllium	Well, if you're trying to do a Public IP for the use as a VIP from a load balancer/director, then there's more to it than simply binding a new IP to the loopback, because that IP /WILL/ get advertised via ARP, by default.
2012-08-13T22:36:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	Beryllium	Which, of course, can and will cause an IP conflict.
2012-08-13T22:37:00.000Z	Beryllium	Psi-Jack	the subject containing the IP is unreachable by the machine I'm trying to access it from, so I want to "pretend" it's accessible. I only need it for one small thing, so it's essentially just a mock server
2012-08-13T22:38:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	Beryllium	Then you want to bind it to the actual ethernet device, not loopback.
2012-08-13T23:13:00.000Z	Beryllium	Psi-Jack	But I don't want the IP to be visible to other machines on the network, I only want it to be visible to localhost. That's why I've been looking at loopback. I just need to say "hey, port 80 on this IP address points at these files". Like I said, there is OS X functionality that does this using BSD's ifconfig, I just want to replicate that in ubuntu
2012-08-13T23:14:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	Beryllium	OKay, so, like I said, even bound to loopback, it WILL advertise in ARP, by default, so it will expose it.
2012-08-13T23:16:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	Beryllium	Not really. What you're asking is rather common.
2012-08-13T23:17:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	Beryllium	http://pastebin.com/0SpBQ9yu  -- This is what you need for /etc/sysctl.d/##-somefile   so that the IP won't broadcast out eth0 (or whatever you change ethX's to in this)
2012-08-13T23:22:00.000Z	Beryllium	Psi-Jack	Alright, thanks for the pastebin, that will be very helpful :)
2012-08-13T23:22:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	Beryllium	Indeed, it will. ;)
2012-08-13T23:22:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	Beryllium	Now, do you want the interfaces example to go with it? It's /really/ easy.
