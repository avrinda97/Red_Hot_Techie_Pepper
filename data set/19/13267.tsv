2007-12-10T14:01:00.000Z	df00z		Hey
2007-12-10T14:02:00.000Z	df00z		are there ubuntu SVN or very up to date packages available for ubuntu?
2007-12-10T14:02:00.000Z	df00z		I'm trying to avoid compiling things from source as much as possible
2007-12-10T14:02:00.000Z	df00z		but the version 7.10 uses is months old
2007-12-10T14:03:00.000Z	df00z		Are there backports for 7.10?
2007-12-10T14:03:00.000Z	astro76	df00z	you can enable backports in Software Sources
2007-12-10T14:07:00.000Z	df00z	astro76	http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/hardy-backports/ I don't see any package for mplayer here?
2007-12-10T14:07:00.000Z	astro76	df00z	that's likely
2007-12-10T14:11:00.000Z	df00z	astro76	? why was it likely, anyway?
2007-12-10T14:12:00.000Z	astro76	df00z	there's really not that many backports and not unless for a good reason... is there a reason you need a mplayer version newer than gutsy's?
2007-12-10T14:12:00.000Z	df00z	astro76	threaded h264 support, etc
2007-12-10T14:13:00.000Z	astro76	df00z	well if you want to remain bleeding edge, get the source from mplayer and compile... if you plan on doing this for lots of things, you might consider a different distro that is not time-based releases
2007-12-10T14:13:00.000Z	df00z	astro76	can't mplayer break when ubuntu updates?  like, library dependencies and such
2007-12-10T14:14:00.000Z	astro76	df00z	sure
2007-12-10T14:15:00.000Z	astro76	df00z	you can't have it both ways, if you want stability, you use a distro which has discrete releases..  if you want bleeding edge, you sacrifice the tested stability of a distro release
2007-12-10T14:15:00.000Z	astro76	df00z	maybe check out gentoo
2007-12-10T14:15:00.000Z	astro76	df00z	or archlinux
2007-12-10T14:16:00.000Z	astro76	df00z	so if you found a distro that was completely up to date on every piece of software, what would you waste your time on? :p
2007-12-10T14:20:00.000Z	df00z	astro76	if I make a package for mplayer, and I build it with libasound 2.0.0, and synaptic updates libasound in the future, will it warn me about the package having dependencies not met?
