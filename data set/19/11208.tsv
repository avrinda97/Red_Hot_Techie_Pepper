2006-08-24T08:21:00.000Z	birdfish		So how is the new Ubuntu Server 6.0 LTS?
2006-08-24T08:21:00.000Z	birdfish		I'm at college and haven't been home in a while to install and test it out :(
2006-08-24T08:21:00.000Z	sethk	birdfish	it's fine, but I recommend installing breezy, and waiting a few weeks more for dapper
2006-08-24T08:22:00.000Z	birdfish	sethk	so 6.06 is Dapper then?
2006-08-24T08:22:00.000Z	sethk	birdfish	right
2006-08-24T08:22:00.000Z	birdfish	sethk	Upgrading from Breezy server to Dapper shouldn't be a problem later, should it?
2006-08-24T08:22:00.000Z	sethk	birdfish	it's easy to upgrade
2006-08-24T08:23:00.000Z	birdfish	sethk	I was just looking forward to having an automated LAMP installer =)
2006-08-24T08:23:00.000Z	sethk	birdfish	you can install that version if you don't mind a few minor glitches
2006-08-24T08:23:00.000Z	sethk	birdfish	hash to be v2
2006-08-24T08:24:00.000Z	birdfish	sethk	hash (meaning open up the package config and manually set?)
2006-08-24T08:24:00.000Z	sethk	birdfish	was that pointed at me?
2006-08-24T08:24:00.000Z	birdfish	sethk	I'm coming from BSD land =P It's been a really long time since I've installed ubuntu =)
2006-08-24T08:25:00.000Z	birdfish	sethk	yep.  I just wanted to clarify what you meant by "hash"
2006-08-24T08:25:00.000Z	sethk	birdfish	sorry, typo, I meant has to be v2
2006-08-24T08:25:00.000Z	birdfish	sethk	Ah, sweet, thanks.  And also, if you don't mind... What are a couple of the biggest bugs I might find in Dapper?
2006-08-24T08:26:00.000Z	sethk	birdfish	there seem to be cases where the install doesn't complete.  very few, but a few.
2006-08-24T08:26:00.000Z	birdfish	sethk	Hm... Sounds like Windows =P
2006-08-24T08:28:00.000Z	sethk	birdfish	I think he just means that a couple of apps didn't run for him
