2009-09-02T05:24:00.000Z	bucky	burf	lspci |grep VGA
2009-09-02T05:37:00.000Z	bucky	burf	can you run dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg and when it asks you which driver say sis ?
2009-09-02T05:38:00.000Z	bucky	burf	can you run sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg and when it asks you which driver say sis ?
2009-09-02T05:44:00.000Z	bucky	burf	have you restarted you desktop since the change?
2009-09-02T05:45:00.000Z	bucky	burf	it will write sis as the driver in that /etc/X11/xorg.conf file
2009-09-02T05:46:00.000Z	bucky	burf	when you configure it with sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg and tell it to use sis
2009-09-02T05:47:00.000Z	bucky	burf	what was the warning?
2009-09-02T05:48:00.000Z	bucky	burf	that's ok
2009-09-02T05:49:00.000Z	bucky	burf	what does this tell you ?   grep sis /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2009-09-02T05:50:00.000Z	bucky	burf	either it returns Driver "sis"  or it doesn't
2009-09-02T05:51:00.000Z	bucky	burf	you must have fat fingered the command.. Ctl-c
2009-09-02T05:53:00.000Z	bucky	burf	what does this tell you ?   grep -i sis /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2009-09-02T05:55:00.000Z	bucky	burf	good.. that means you have told xorg to use sis.. now if you can't tell it to with dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg then you might have to edit the file by hand to show Driver "sis" and restart X
2009-09-02T05:56:00.000Z	burf	bucky	- yes ok but i did already have that entry in my file earlier
2009-09-02T05:56:00.000Z	bucky	burf	Driver "sis"
2009-09-02T05:57:00.000Z	bucky	burf	to which file?
2009-09-02T05:58:00.000Z	bucky	burf	open it with an editor.. grep can't find it because it's not there.. that maybe what it back up tho
