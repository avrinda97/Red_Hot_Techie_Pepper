2009-12-29T19:52:00.000Z	nipun	ActionParsnip	right now,m on my friends comp....and am kinda a beginner,so anything will be helpful...???
2009-12-29T19:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nipun	i gave the command you need to run in a terminal
2009-12-29T19:55:00.000Z	nipun	ActionParsnip	i'll definately try that. can u tell me the reason though....why i can run the windows perfectly well, but the screen starts flickering like crazy...and the system has 2 be shut down...plz hlp,can't access the system right now!
2009-12-29T19:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nipun	you havent configured drivers yet as its a clean install
2009-12-29T19:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nipun	none of my systems go above 640x480 without drivers
2009-12-29T19:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nipun	under windows
2009-12-29T19:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nipun	and what windows does or doesnt do i moot
2009-12-29T19:58:00.000Z	nipun	ActionParsnip	: do the drivers have to be installed seperately after installing ubuntu,i thought they came preloaded?
2009-12-29T19:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nipun	with some cards yes, with some no
2009-12-29T19:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nipun	once you run the command you will know the video card and you can websearch to find guides
2009-12-29T20:00:00.000Z	nipun	ActionParsnip	: okay.....thanks a lot,i think i get it now!
2009-12-29T20:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nipun	if its nvidia you are laughig
2009-12-29T20:01:00.000Z	nipun	ActionParsnip	: btw,i have an iso image of ubuntu 9.10, how can ii update my current 8.04 without having to uninstall the entire od?
2009-12-29T20:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nipun	you will need the 9.04 alternate CD as well as the 9.10 alternate CD. You cannot upgrade direct to 9.10 and you cannot upgrade with the desktop ISO
2009-12-29T20:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nipun	or you can upgrade using the web
2009-12-29T20:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nipun	you cannot skip releases
2009-12-29T20:04:00.000Z	nipun	ActionParsnip	: and how can i uninstall the 8.04,without the help of windows, i installed it from a bootable cd..
