2009-08-19T19:55:00.000Z	hbekel	coldReactive42	you're reinventing the wheel, you can use udev to get consistent device naming
2009-08-19T19:55:00.000Z	hbekel	coldReactive42	but very creative ;)
2009-08-19T19:56:00.000Z	hbekel	coldReactive42	you have to create a rule that creates a symlink, e.g. /dev/scanner, based on the devices serial
2009-08-19T19:56:00.000Z	hbekel	coldReactive42	by writing a udev rule
2009-08-19T19:58:00.000Z	hbekel	coldReactive42	yes, /dev/scanner will be created by udev if you tell it to to so
2009-08-19T19:58:00.000Z	hbekel	coldReactive42	that was just an example
2009-08-19T20:02:00.000Z	hbekel	coldReactive42	you'll have to do that yourself, there's lots of tutorials
2009-08-19T20:02:00.000Z	hbekel	coldReactive42	google knows
2009-08-19T20:03:00.000Z	hbekel	coldReactive42	that doesn't matter, your problem is inconsistent device naming, which can be solved with udev
2009-08-19T20:06:00.000Z	hbekel	coldReactive42	the principle is the same, you'll just have to adapt it
2009-08-19T20:18:00.000Z	hbekel	coldReactive42	that thread is from 2005, try 'udevadm monitor'
2009-08-19T20:25:00.000Z	hbekel	coldReactive42	udevadm info -a -p `udevadm info -q path -n /dev/sda`
2009-08-19T20:25:00.000Z	hbekel	coldReactive42	replace /dev/sda with your scanners device
2009-08-19T20:26:00.000Z	hbekel	coldReactive42	you said you have used your scanner
2009-08-19T20:26:00.000Z	hbekel	coldReactive42	use what you've used before
2009-08-19T20:27:00.000Z	hbekel	coldReactive42	forget it
2009-08-19T20:28:00.000Z	hbekel	coldReactive42	and if you want help, highlight
