2011-03-25T17:43:00.000Z	strouthos		How can I force a progam running in a shell to be "released" from the shell?
2011-03-25T17:43:00.000Z	sipior	strouthos	you mean run in the background?
2011-03-25T17:43:00.000Z	sipior	strouthos	ctrl-Z, then "bg".
2011-03-25T17:44:00.000Z	strouthos	sipior	I mean getting the "output" (status, debug etc.) in the shell.
2011-03-25T17:44:00.000Z	strouthos	sipior	When running gedit in shell, it is no different from just launching it.
2011-03-25T17:45:00.000Z	sipior	strouthos	try using redirection operators ("foo > output.file 2>&1")
2011-03-25T17:47:00.000Z	strouthos	sipior	if "moo" was meant to be "gedit", it didn't work. If not, I didn't understand.
2011-03-25T17:47:00.000Z	strouthos	sipior	"foo", not "moo" :)
2011-03-25T17:48:00.000Z	sipior	strouthos	i guess i'm not following what the problem is. you want to run gedit from the terminal, and want to suppress all output? then: gedit filename > /dev/null 2>&1
2011-03-25T17:51:00.000Z	strouthos	sipior	I want to run gedit from the terminal and see all the output. (Thus the session will only be used for displaying the output of gedit.)
2011-03-25T17:52:00.000Z	sipior	strouthos	gedit does not use the terminal for display. if you want a terminal-based editor, consider vim, emacs, nano, joe (there are approximately a billion others :-)
2011-03-25T17:54:00.000Z	strouthos	sipior	I will run gedit in a own window but from the terminal. I'm using LaTeX and want to see the output and errors.
2011-03-25T17:55:00.000Z	sipior	strouthos	i don't use gedit myself, but if you are using a LaTeX mode of the editor, i imagine the editor displays processing errors in its own environment, not in the terminal.
2011-03-25T17:57:00.000Z	strouthos	sipior	The thing it, it did it until today (now like then I simply ran "gedit").
2011-03-25T17:59:00.000Z	strouthos	sipior	Then again, today gedit doesn't want to open the pdf viewer either....
2011-03-25T18:00:00.000Z	sipior	strouthos	maybe it's time to try another editor :-)
2011-03-25T18:02:00.000Z	strouthos	sipior	Haha. But isn't it strange when I run a command (gedit) and while this command is still running, I can use the terminal for other things?
2011-03-25T18:02:00.000Z	sipior	strouthos	not really.
2011-03-25T18:03:00.000Z	strouthos	sipior	okay :-)
