2009-05-03T10:50:00.000Z	MarkJones		why would you underclock a video card?
2009-05-03T10:51:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	MarkJones	B/c I am sick and tired of my GPU going upto 117 degrees Celsius. I don't want 30 minutes of battery life with fans at full all the time
2009-05-03T10:52:00.000Z	MarkJones	WebcamWonder	Does your laptop bios offer cool and quiet or anything simaler for power and fan managment?
2009-05-03T10:52:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	MarkJones	Couldn't find anything last time I went into bios
2009-05-03T10:53:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	MarkJones	I believe the idle way is to turn on Coolbits and manage it from the config utility... but with regards to the speeds and options available, I have no clue
2009-05-03T10:53:00.000Z	MarkJones	WebcamWonder	Yeah not sure if you can underclock with coolbits or not.
2009-05-03T10:54:00.000Z	MarkJones	WebcamWonder	Maybe you need to call your laptop manufacturer and ask them why its so hot? Thats a bit extreme IMO.
2009-05-03T10:55:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	MarkJones	My processor goes upto 86 degrees. It is HP, they know about this, and won't do anything extra ordinary.. just replace the part if they die
2009-05-03T10:55:00.000Z	MarkJones	WebcamWonder	Yep HP, doesnt suprise me with them.
2009-05-03T10:56:00.000Z	MarkJones	WebcamWonder	How old is the laptop?
2009-05-03T10:56:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	MarkJones	~ 2 years
2009-05-03T10:57:00.000Z	MarkJones	WebcamWonder	You probably have googled your brains out trying to find some info it already I take it?
2009-05-03T10:57:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	MarkJones	Yeah.... this thing even died once and had to send it in for repair. It is all b/c of the nVidia chipset on this. It has the infamous chipset which overheats... and burns the motherboard alongside it
2009-05-03T10:58:00.000Z	MarkJones	WebcamWonder	Ouch What model is it?
2009-05-03T10:58:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	MarkJones	Presario v6000, specifically, v6305
2009-05-03T11:02:00.000Z	MarkJones	WebcamWonder	If I were you that would be the last thing i would ever buy from HP. I had an HP monitor back in the day and went through 3 of them, one burned out right after the other. I dont touch HP anything anymore.
2009-05-03T11:03:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	MarkJones	Yeah... lesson learnt :(... Anyways, off to trying crazy things with the nvidia utility to see if I can underclock this thing
2009-05-03T11:03:00.000Z	MarkJones	WebcamWonder	Also make sure theres not a lot of dust blocking air flow.
2009-05-03T11:04:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	MarkJones	Yup, there isn't. Thanks anyways!
