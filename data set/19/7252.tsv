2007-10-15T09:38:00.000Z	Zombine		is there some place where I can download a header called process.h?
2007-10-15T09:38:00.000Z	erUSUL	Zombine	'sudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r)'
2007-10-15T09:41:00.000Z	Zombine	erUSUL	So, $ should be replaced with the name of the header I'm looking for?
2007-10-15T09:48:00.000Z	erUSUL	Zombine	the command is to be executed as is
2007-10-15T09:50:00.000Z	Zombine	erUSUL	Ah.  Says Linux-headers is up-to-date
2007-10-15T09:52:00.000Z	Zombine	erUSUL	I found the source code for a file called process.h online.  Aside from the risk of malicious code, could I just put this in my include directory as-is?
2007-10-15T09:55:00.000Z	erUSUL	Zombine	well a *.h without the corresponding c code or lib is mostly useless (you neeed the implementation too)
2007-10-15T09:55:00.000Z	erUSUL	Zombine	what is supposed to offer the *.h file?
2007-10-15T09:56:00.000Z	Zombine	erUSUL	No chance that the program I'm trying to compile has the implementation?
2007-10-15T09:56:00.000Z	Zombine	erUSUL	I found it at koders.com
2007-10-15T09:57:00.000Z	Zombine	erUSUL	Also Digital Mars, GNU Common C++, and there's a wikipedia article about it
2007-10-15T09:58:00.000Z	erUSUL	Zombine	what are you trying to compile?
2007-10-15T09:59:00.000Z	erUSUL	Zombine	did you instaled build-essential
2007-10-15T09:59:00.000Z	erUSUL		?
2007-10-15T09:59:00.000Z	Zombine	erUSUL	It's a dock app for *box (yes I have fluxbox installed) that measures my battery capacity.  bbacpi
2007-10-15T09:59:00.000Z	Zombine	erUSUL	Yes indeed I have
2007-10-15T10:03:00.000Z	Zombine	erUSUL	So.... think it might?  And since it's all just abstract functions, there's a good chance it can't actually do anything bad to my comp unless something implements it to do so, right?
2007-10-15T10:04:00.000Z	erUSUL	Zombine	i guess so but can not tell for sure
2007-10-15T10:05:00.000Z	Zombine	erUSUL	I see.  Well if it doesn't work, then I haven't really lost anything except time, which I have an abundance of, so I'll try downloading it.
