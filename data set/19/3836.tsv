2010-03-11T12:10:00.000Z	claptrap		Alright, folks, need some true help
2010-03-11T12:11:00.000Z	claptrap		Through a rather embarassing series of events I'd rather not discuss, I managed to format a 500 GB HDD with a lot of personal and irreplaceable data on it. I don't have another 500 GB HDD (my only other is 250) nor do I have the money to buy one. What are my options, here?

2010-03-11T12:14:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	claptrap	What are you even asking?
2010-03-11T12:14:00.000Z	claptrap	LinuxGuy2009	Guess I wasn't terribly clear. I want to recover the drive.
2010-03-11T12:14:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	claptrap	What was the file system?
2010-03-11T12:15:00.000Z	claptrap	LinuxGuy2009	Originally NTFS, formatted it to ext3
2010-03-11T12:15:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	claptrap	ext3 doesnt allow for file recovery I dont believe.
2010-03-11T12:16:00.000Z	claptrap	LinuxGuy2009	So if I formatted the NTFS to ext3, it's all gone for good now?
2010-03-11T12:16:00.000Z	claptrap	LinuxGuy2009	Because gpart can /find/ the NTFS partition I'm trying to recover, but it wants another 500 GB drive to attempt recovery.
2010-03-11T12:17:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	claptrap	Well then that answers your question.
2010-03-11T12:18:00.000Z	claptrap	LinuxGuy2009	Actually, no, it doesn't. My question is whether or not there is ANOTHER way to recover that drive, or even individual files, as I simply have no way of getting my hands on a second 500GB hard drive right now.
2010-03-11T12:18:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	claptrap	Well yeah it does answer the question. You just said that you need another 500gb drive to recover it. There ya go.
2010-03-11T12:19:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	claptrap	You not being able to afford to buy one is beside the point.
2010-03-11T12:19:00.000Z	claptrap	LinuxGuy2009	Thank you for clearly not listening at all. :)
2010-03-11T12:20:00.000Z	claptrap	LinuxGuy2009	My question is whether or not there was a method that didn't involve a second hard drive. I don't see how I can be any more clear on what I'm asking.
2010-03-11T12:20:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	claptrap	No theres no way to fit 500GB on a smaller drive. No.
2010-03-11T12:21:00.000Z	claptrap	LinuxGuy2009	Please just stop trying. You're not listening to me at all, and you're really only frustrating me more. Thank you for trying, though.
2010-03-11T12:21:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	claptrap	Not sure what answer you want but thats the jist of it. Sorry.
