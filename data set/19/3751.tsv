2011-10-27T00:26:00.000Z	semitones		is there a safety mode for dd?  I don't want to accidentally erase my computer
2011-10-27T00:27:00.000Z	semitones		i'm trying to do this: sudo dd if=/dev/sdb of=/home/me/sansa/file1
2011-10-27T00:27:00.000Z	semitones		will that command pose any danger?
2011-10-27T00:28:00.000Z	klync	semitones	might not be as useful as you think; would be dangerous if /home/me is on sdb
2011-10-27T00:28:00.000Z	klync	semitones	what are you *really* trying to do?
2011-10-27T00:28:00.000Z	semitones	klync	home/me/ is on sda5
2011-10-27T00:29:00.000Z	klync	semitones	and you have enough space there?
2011-10-27T00:29:00.000Z	semitones	klync	i'm working with #rockbox to unbrick my sansa, i'm just unfamiliar with dd
2011-10-27T00:29:00.000Z	semitones	klync	yes, sda5 has oodles of free space, sdb1 is 30 mb
2011-10-27T00:30:00.000Z	klync	semitones	oic ... yeah, that's no problem; i'd also do bs=2048 fwiw
2011-10-27T00:30:00.000Z	semitones	klync	what does specifying that do?
2011-10-27T00:30:00.000Z	klync	semitones	best advice i can give is to triple check if= and of= before hitting enter!
2011-10-27T00:31:00.000Z	semitones	klync	did you get that last message? what does the block size command do?
2011-10-27T00:31:00.000Z	klync	semitones	bs= "blocksize" ... i.e. how many bytes to read before writing ...
2011-10-27T00:31:00.000Z	semitones	klync	and why is it good to specify?
2011-10-27T00:31:00.000Z	klync	semitones	variety of reasons; probably not necessary; might speed things up a bit
2011-10-27T00:38:00.000Z	semitones	klync	If I wanted to see if the two dd'd files were the same, would I take the md5sum?
2011-10-27T00:38:00.000Z	semitones		md5sum -b perhaps?
2011-10-27T00:41:00.000Z	semitones	klync	if I wanted to see if those two dd'd files were the same, would I take the md5sum -b of both?
