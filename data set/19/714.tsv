2011-10-05T02:55:00.000Z	tsturzl		I've installed nvidia-173 and I'm still not getting hardware acceleration on my geforce9400m
2011-10-05T02:56:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	tsturzl	I had the same thing and could never get it working
2011-10-05T02:56:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	tsturzl	Got ATI now and got it working, but I like everything else about nvidia in linux better
2011-10-05T02:58:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	tsturzl	if you figure it out please please let me know, I've still got the card
2011-10-05T02:58:00.000Z	tsturzl	noisewaterphd	what exactly was your issue, and what card was it?
2011-10-05T02:58:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	tsturzl	just could never get hardware acceleration working
2011-10-05T02:59:00.000Z	tsturzl	noisewaterphd	what card?
2011-10-05T03:02:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	tsturzl	I think GTX 570? Id have to go downstairs and look, also can't get it working with the cuda or whatever is in my notebook
2011-10-05T03:03:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	tsturzl	Quadro w/cuda, sorry
2011-10-05T03:06:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	tsturzl	ya, tried with the download, and both options avail within ubuntu, and multiple different suggestions for xorg conf
2011-10-05T03:07:00.000Z	tsturzl	noisewaterphd	Did you uninstall Nouveau, the NV display driver, and run nvidia-xconfig?
2011-10-05T03:07:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	tsturzl	finally put this older radeon in the desktop and got it working no prob, which is fine since that is what I mostly use the desktop for, but I'd rather use the nvidia and get it working on my notebook as well
2011-10-05T03:10:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	tsturzl	are nv and nouveau not the same thing?
2011-10-05T03:11:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	tsturzl	trying to remember which one I tried if they are different, I believe I tried nouveau
2011-10-05T03:11:00.000Z	tsturzl	noisewaterphd	NV is just a display driver, Nouveau is an experimental opensource Nvidia driver with 2d acceleration and very little 3d acceleration
2011-10-05T03:12:00.000Z	tsturzl	noisewaterphd	Don't use Nouveau, you can expect the project to have hardware acceleration done by the time robots rule the earth.
2011-10-05T03:14:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	tsturzl	i think the answer is yes then, actually im fairly certain i somehow got NV, but it presents itself as nouveau at readout, maybe i got them together somehow? who knows its been a while now. I do know that I scoured the earth to get it working and never did
2011-10-05T03:14:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	tsturzl	didnt try that hard with the quadro in my notebook though, perhaps I should
2011-10-05T03:17:00.000Z	tsturzl	noisewaterphd	Yeah Nv is the default driver for nvidia cards, you should uninstall that when you install your proprietary nvidia driver. Once you're done run nvidia-xconfig because anytime you install/uninstall any package related to xorg, your xorg.conf changes
