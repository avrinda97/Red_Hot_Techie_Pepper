2008-02-12T08:35:00.000Z	BagelMaster		Can someone translate* this for me?  "I had trouble mounting this too, but it turns out it is actually a binary installer (not an image). just make it executable (chmod 744 or something) and run the bin."
2008-02-12T08:36:00.000Z	BagelMaster		Nickrud, thank you
2008-02-12T08:38:00.000Z	BagelMaster		Nickrud: All I get is "bash: /home/dan/MAPLESOFT.Maple.v11.0.Linux-AGAiN: is a directory"
2008-02-12T08:39:00.000Z	BagelMaster		Nope, it came in the separate 5mb pieces PIECE.r1, PIECE.r2, PIECE.r3...
2008-02-12T08:39:00.000Z	BagelMaster		and so on
2008-02-12T08:40:00.000Z	BagelMaster		Nickrud: No clue, in Windoze I could just make it into an .iso and mount/burn, but I don't know how to in Linux
2008-02-12T08:41:00.000Z	badkitty	BagelMaster	There is a great program to mount images
2008-02-12T08:41:00.000Z	badkitty	BagelMaster	Look into gmount-iso
2008-02-12T08:42:00.000Z	badkitty	BagelMaster	There are also nautilus scripts you can use to do this also.. although I haven't had luck with that one yet..
2008-02-12T08:42:00.000Z	badkitty	BagelMaster	Part files?
2008-02-12T08:42:00.000Z	badkitty	BagelMaster	Tried googleing it?
2008-02-12T08:44:00.000Z	badkitty	BagelMaster	Right I see.. Yah it should be able to be run then and it should self compile.. Atleast thats how it works in winblows
2008-02-12T08:44:00.000Z	badkitty	BagelMaster	What did you say the other files were? You said something about a binary??
2008-02-12T08:45:00.000Z	badkitty	BagelMaster	I haven't used parted rar files in linux but in windows you just start the first .rar and all the parts self extract and make on big file
2008-02-12T08:46:00.000Z	badkitty	BagelMaster	Did that work 4 u
2008-02-12T08:46:00.000Z	badkitty	BagelMaster	Ok so lets say you run the .bin file?
2008-02-12T08:47:00.000Z	badkitty	BagelMaster	Or I think you can also click on the icon to run it too from nautilus?
2008-02-12T08:48:00.000Z	badkitty	BagelMaster	The file browser.. from what ive gathered thats what it is
2008-02-12T08:48:00.000Z	badkitty	BagelMaster	Great
