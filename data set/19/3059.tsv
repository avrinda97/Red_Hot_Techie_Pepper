2009-11-02T21:48:00.000Z	om26er	yellowsun	blanck cd or dvd
2009-11-02T21:51:00.000Z	yellowsun	om26er	,  scanner acer 320p  Parallel port Model in not Usb
2009-11-02T21:51:00.000Z	om26er	yellowsun	but you can boot karmic koala from live cd and test your scanner if it works
2009-11-02T21:52:00.000Z	om26er	yellowsun	without installing
2009-11-02T21:52:00.000Z	yellowsun	om26er	 I have ubuntu 9.04
2009-11-02T21:52:00.000Z	om26er	yellowsun	and scanner works fine in 9.04?
2009-11-02T21:53:00.000Z	om26er	yellowsun	i am telling you to download 9.10 cd and without installing it check that if you scanner works in ubuntu karmic koala
2009-11-02T21:54:00.000Z	yellowsun	om26er	 not, because xsane the law the scanner and not is not drivers for linux
2009-11-02T22:03:00.000Z	yellowsun	om26er	:  and without installing it check that if you scanner works in ubuntu karmic koala (as I make to verify it)
2009-11-02T22:03:00.000Z	om26er	yellowsun	you can try a scan to verify
2009-11-02T22:06:00.000Z	yellowsun	om26er	 after to have inserted the cd of ubuntu 9,10 I must open it with the package manager?
2009-11-02T22:07:00.000Z	om26er	yellowsun	no
2009-11-02T22:07:00.000Z	om26er	yellowsun	reboot and boot from cd and then select
2009-11-02T22:07:00.000Z	om26er	yellowsun	try ubunut without any changes to disk
2009-11-02T22:08:00.000Z	om26er	yellowsun	when the session starts try to scan something with your scanner. if its work then install karmic if you want
2009-11-02T22:13:00.000Z	om26er	yellowsun	i cannot understand your last line
2009-11-02T22:13:00.000Z	om26er	yellowsun	you mean to say that your scanner don't wok in karmic
