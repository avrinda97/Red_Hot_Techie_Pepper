2011-01-24T00:06:00.000Z	ronr__	magicianlord	do I lag really badly or did you miss my really long message before?
2011-01-24T00:09:00.000Z	magicianlord	ronr__	i missed it. i will scroll up
2011-01-24T00:09:00.000Z	ronr__	magicianlord	thanks.
2011-01-24T00:10:00.000Z	magicianlord	ronr__	update the system first. reboot. then install nvidia and reboot
2011-01-24T00:11:00.000Z	ronr__	magicianlord	and if I haven't done that already, any way to rescue? it seems that from the GRUB screen, if I choose the server kernel, it gives me the same error and if I choose the generic kernel, it loads up fine.
2011-01-24T00:15:00.000Z	ronr__	magicianlord	sorry for bugging you, just not sure if you saw my last response.
2011-01-24T00:15:00.000Z	magicianlord	ronr__	i didnt
2011-01-24T00:16:00.000Z	ronr__	magicianlord	and if I haven't done that already, any way to rescue? it seems that from the GRUB screen, if I choose the server kernel, it gives me the same error and if I choose the generic kernel, it loads up fine.
2011-01-24T00:16:00.000Z	magicianlord	ronr__	why are you choosing server kernel? are you on a desktop system
2011-01-24T00:17:00.000Z	ronr__	magicianlord	I don't know how it got installed. so I should remove the server kernel and it should boot up fine?
2011-01-24T00:20:00.000Z	magicianlord	ronr__	you could try remove that kernel, yes. but have a regular ubuntu iso cd or usb stick ready to reinstall if necessary
2011-01-24T00:21:00.000Z	ronr__	magicianlord	I have it since I reinstalled just last night. I'm trying to figure out how to remove the server kernel. I found the generic kernels in the Synaptic but can't seem to find the server ones.
