2012-01-30T23:13:00.000Z	trism	kaipreshaw	oh, just reinstall gdm
2012-01-30T23:13:00.000Z	trism	kaipreshaw	it should ask you the question after: sudo apt-get install gdm;
2012-01-30T23:15:00.000Z	kaipreshaw	trism	i got KDM
2012-01-30T23:15:00.000Z	trism	kaipreshaw	I understand that, but you said you wanted to use gdm instead
2012-01-30T23:16:00.000Z	kaipreshaw	trism	is there some way of geting GDM
2012-01-30T23:16:00.000Z	trism	kaipreshaw	yes, installing it: sudo apt-get install gdm;
2012-01-30T23:17:00.000Z	trism	kaipreshaw	although, on oneiric, the default is actually lightdm, so if you want to go back to what you had in a default install, it would be lightdm instead
2012-01-30T23:18:00.000Z	kaipreshaw	trism	how do i do it
2012-01-30T23:18:00.000Z	kaipreshaw		!it | sae
2012-01-30T23:18:00.000Z	trism	kaipreshaw	sudo dpkg-reconfigure lightdm; if lightdm is still installed
