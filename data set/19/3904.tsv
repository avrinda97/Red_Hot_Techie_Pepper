2009-05-20T00:15:00.000Z	blixt		greetings!  new to linux and ubuntu. How do i track down things.. something sends a loud beep to my speakers on shutdown...
2009-05-20T00:15:00.000Z	blixt		this occures after skype install
2009-05-20T00:17:00.000Z	blixt		never mind the beep...  is installing kde a good idea?
2009-05-20T00:19:00.000Z	blixt		ahh.. i c... so with ubuntu the gnome window system is what i am running
2009-05-20T00:19:00.000Z	blixt		so kde would simply mess stuff upp i guess
2009-05-20T00:19:00.000Z	blixt		didn't really know what kde is
2009-05-20T00:20:00.000Z	blixt		it came up when i was looking for a good web editor
2009-05-20T00:20:00.000Z	blixt		looking at the homepage of quanta...
2009-05-20T00:21:00.000Z	blixt		i got it!  thnx!
2009-05-20T00:21:00.000Z	blixt		quanta seams to have stopped development 2008-02
2009-05-20T00:22:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	blixt	most likely due to kde4
2009-05-20T00:22:00.000Z	blixt		in xp environment i use Studio MX
2009-05-20T00:22:00.000Z	blixt		tried to install wine to run it on but the install failed..
2009-05-20T00:25:00.000Z	blixt	Paddy_EIRE	is kde4 a web editor? is it recomendable?
2009-05-20T00:26:00.000Z	blixt		ahh.. like kde..
2009-05-20T00:26:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	blixt	no kde4 is a desktop environment using qt4.. quanta plus was designed for qt3 (kde3) which now means that a large amount of apps require porting
2009-05-20T00:27:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	blixt	use kompozer
2009-05-20T00:27:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	blixt	or do things the healthy way and use a good text editor
2009-05-20T00:27:00.000Z	blixt	Paddy_EIRE	great: i will check it out
