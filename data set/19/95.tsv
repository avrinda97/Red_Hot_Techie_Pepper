2012-09-20T17:42:00.000Z	polysics		hello
2012-09-20T17:42:00.000Z	polysics		been trying to get a shell script to run on login in a terminal for a while now
2012-09-20T17:42:00.000Z	polysics		I tried with gnome-terminal -e and -x but it does not run
2012-09-20T17:42:00.000Z	polysics		script does a cd followed by executinga ruby file
2012-09-20T17:44:00.000Z	zykotick9	polysics	are you giving "gnome-terminal -e /full/path/to/script" and is the script executable?  is the cd "required"?
2012-09-20T17:44:00.000Z	polysics		the cd is required because of some relative paths I can't change atm
2012-09-20T17:44:00.000Z	polysics		and yes, I would say the path is correct
2012-09-20T17:45:00.000Z	polysics		what's weird is taht running gnome-terminal -e /full/path in another terminal works
2012-09-20T17:52:00.000Z	polysics		I tried everything: launchers, shell, anything
2012-09-20T17:52:00.000Z	polysics		the terminal window shows up for a split second then goes away
2012-09-20T17:56:00.000Z	polysics		in fact, it seems that no autorun at all works here
2012-09-20T17:56:00.000Z	polysics		not even just running, say, gnome-terminal on login
2012-09-20T17:56:00.000Z	polysics		it does not open!
2012-09-20T17:56:00.000Z	zykotick9	polysics	try "xterm -hold -e foo"
2012-09-20T17:58:00.000Z	polysics	zykotick9	this got me slightly further
2012-09-20T17:59:00.000Z	polysics		it is apparently not finding bundler
2012-09-20T17:59:00.000Z	polysics		how do I run a command as if I logged in, bash profile and all?
2012-09-20T17:59:00.000Z	polysics		please
2012-09-20T18:12:00.000Z	polysics	zykotick9	owe you a couple beers
