2008-05-24T23:53:00.000Z	sshirley		Is a 3mb/sec buffered read transfer rate bad for a SATA dvd drive?
2008-05-24T23:54:00.000Z	sshirley		And should I be using SDPARM instead of HDPARM?
2008-05-24T23:56:00.000Z	sshirley		When I play movies on my Mythbuntu box, sometimes the DVD skips a bit. I think it can't handle it due to current settings
2008-05-24T23:56:00.000Z	sshirley		So I wasn't sure if I should be using sdparm or hdparm
2008-05-24T23:56:00.000Z	erUSUL	sshirley	check dmesg mesages to see how it gets configured
2008-05-24T23:57:00.000Z	sshirley	erUSUL	'dmesg /dev/scd0'?
2008-05-24T23:57:00.000Z	erUSUL	sshirley	"dmesg | grep ata" --> [    3.767298] ata6.00: ATAPI: _NEC DVD_RW ND-3540A, 1.01, max UDMA/33 (in my case)
2008-05-24T23:59:00.000Z	sshirley	erUSUL	ata3.00: ATAPI: HL-DT-ST DVD+/-RW GSA-H73N, B103, max UDMA/100
2008-05-24T23:59:00.000Z	erUSUL	sshirley	my unit does 3 MB/s too
2008-05-24T23:59:00.000Z	sshirley	erUSUL	Thats not good is it? 'max UDMA/100'?
2008-05-25T00:00:00.000Z	erUSUL	sshirley	yep mine is udma/33  ;P
2008-05-25T00:00:00.000Z	sshirley	erUSUL	Wow! So it's about as good as it's gonna get?
2008-05-25T00:01:00.000Z	erUSUL	sshirley	yep i think (there may be other tweakable through hdparm=
2008-05-25T00:01:00.000Z	sshirley	erUSUL	Should I use sdparm instead of hdparm?
2008-05-25T00:02:00.000Z	erUSUL	sshirley	if you can make some sense of the command ... its man page scares the hell out of me
2008-05-25T00:02:00.000Z	sshirley	erUSUL	Yeah....the manpage is not good
2008-05-25T00:04:00.000Z	sshirley	erUSUL	Is UDMA/133 good for hard drives? They're SATAII.
2008-05-25T00:05:00.000Z	erUSUL	sshirley	tht's the maximun it will report ... UDMA settings makes no much sense on a sata drive (they are legacy from pata days)
2008-05-25T00:11:00.000Z	erUSUL	sshirley	you can use hdparm on sata drives but the effect is minor sata drives are autoconfigred by the kernel driver to optimun values and there is nothing you can "force" on them
