2009-05-22T09:30:00.000Z	RHorse	iamtechno	find out where libopen1..l. is the link to where the prog looksfor it.
2009-05-22T09:32:00.000Z	iamtechno	RHorse	I am trying out the Unigine Demos and I had them working a while ago and now they don't work. I have already sym linked all of the libopenal.so.0 to libopenal.so.1 and it still doesn't work.
2009-05-22T09:35:00.000Z	RHorse	iamtechno	it's not seeing it. Find out why.
2009-05-22T09:35:00.000Z	RHorse	iamtechno	check your permissions
2009-05-22T09:35:00.000Z	iamtechno	RHorse	Where do I find Unigine's search path at?
2009-05-22T09:36:00.000Z	RHorse	iamtechno	try whereis ...
2009-05-22T09:38:00.000Z	iamtechno	RHorse	tried that. It gave me /usr/lib and /usr/lib64 and both copies of libopenal.so.0 are sym linked to so.1
2009-05-22T09:39:00.000Z	RHorse	iamtechno	didn't itt say could not find *.0?
2009-05-22T09:39:00.000Z	iamtechno	RHorse	yes. All I have on my sys is *.1 so I symlinked .0 to .1 so it might help.
2009-05-22T09:40:00.000Z	iamtechno	RHorse	in /usr/lib with the .1 file
2009-05-22T09:41:00.000Z	RHorse	iamtechno	rename .1 somethin else.
2009-05-22T09:41:00.000Z	iamtechno	RHorse	I'm going to pastebin a copy of the log.html
2009-05-22T09:42:00.000Z	iamtechno	RHorse	http://pastebin.com/daf65ba4
2009-05-22T09:43:00.000Z	iamtechno	RHorse	I have also notice that it complains about not having VBO support, which a couple of other programs have complained about.
2009-05-22T09:44:00.000Z	iamtechno	RHorse	but I have a Radeon HD 4870 with the latest fglrx drivers (9.5)
2009-05-25T08:58:00.000Z	iamtechno	RHorse	the good book says 'do unto others as others do unto you'
