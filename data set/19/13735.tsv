2005-02-01T11:08:00.000Z	Bisclaveret		it kinda sucks because i have a really old system and i can only have 1 HD in at a time (only 3 molex connectors)
2005-02-01T11:08:00.000Z	Bisclaveret		otherwise i would try to use a windows bootdisk and do a reformat of the drive
2005-02-01T11:09:00.000Z	Bisclaveret		necro: id' have to modify my case for that.. and it would be pretty cramped
2005-02-01T11:09:00.000Z	Bisclaveret		MATX power supply in a minitower right now. it's an old eMachines etower 566^i2
2005-02-01T11:10:00.000Z	Bisclaveret		120w psu and i've no idea how it's powering a cdrwiter, HD, 2 usb devices, and my geforce 2
2005-02-01T11:11:00.000Z	Bisclaveret		my bios can detect it fine.. it's.. .a Quantum Fireball Lct 15. 7.5gig
2005-02-01T11:11:00.000Z	Bisclaveret		yeah i know, Quantums suck] 
2005-02-01T11:13:00.000Z	Bisclaveret		wouldn't the repartitioning and formatting fix that? beh. i could try to stick it in my 386 and attempt a low-level format
2005-02-01T11:13:00.000Z	Bisclaveret		would take forever but my 386's bios can do lowlevel formats and interleave disks
2005-02-01T11:14:00.000Z	Ex-Cyber	Bisclaveret	I often hear that most modern HDs fake the low-level format because the hardware needed to do the low-level format only exists at the factory (cf. CD-R pregroove)
2005-02-01T11:15:00.000Z	Bisclaveret		heh.. i've only been a windows user since 98 or so >.> i'm a dos-man
2005-02-01T11:17:00.000Z	Bisclaveret	Ex-Cyber	when i upgraded my 386dx to use IDE devices last year i had to LLF my new 120mb seagate
2005-02-01T11:19:00.000Z	Bisclaveret		if anyone wants a slightly failing ST-225 halfheight, ST-412 interface, they can have it. had to get rid of it because the motor for driving the platters is starting to fail. it's losing RPM's randomly, thus making you reboot the computer and spewing trash all over the hd, but no media errors
2005-02-01T11:19:00.000Z	Bisclaveret		i'm using win2kpro >.>
2005-02-01T11:19:00.000Z	Bisclaveret		up until last week i was using winme ;)
2005-02-01T11:20:00.000Z	Bisclaveret		i dunno. i liked winME. it was functional
2005-02-01T11:20:00.000Z	Bisclaveret		people were amazed at my ability to constantly get 1 week+ uptime from it
2005-02-01T11:21:00.000Z	Bisclaveret		"OMFG j00 have to reboot every 40 minutestst"
2005-02-01T11:21:00.000Z	Ex-Cyber	Bisclaveret	something like that :)
