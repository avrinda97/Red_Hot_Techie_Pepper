2011-07-10T16:47:00.000Z	ikonia	bryaniiix	ok - so there "is" a driver for it, it's the xbox game controller, the forum instructions tell you what to do

2011-07-10T16:58:00.000Z	ikonia	bryaniiix	you need to explain the problem

2011-07-10T17:00:00.000Z	ikonia	bryaniiix	can you please open a terminal and type "uname -a" and paste the otuput
