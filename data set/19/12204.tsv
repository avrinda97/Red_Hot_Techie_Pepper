2008-03-30T02:14:00.000Z	soundray	stephan	please read the private messages from ubotu
2008-03-30T02:15:00.000Z	soundray	stephan	to install the binary driver, go through System-Administration-Restricted Drivers Manager
2008-03-30T02:19:00.000Z	soundray	stephan	just spend some time with the links you got
2008-03-30T02:19:00.000Z	soundray	stephan	do what  I told you
2008-03-30T02:19:00.000Z	soundray	stephan	to install the binary driver, go through System-Administration-Restricted Drivers Manager
2008-03-30T02:20:00.000Z	soundray	stephan	that gets you the latest driver that is known compatible with your Ubuntu version
2008-03-30T02:22:00.000Z	soundray	stephan	try audacious if you like WinAmp
2008-03-30T02:34:00.000Z	soundray	stephan	no
2008-03-30T02:34:00.000Z	soundray	stephan	there is a better chance of it working if you mount your XP drive and use it as wine's C drive.
2008-03-30T02:35:00.000Z	soundray	stephan	otherwise you won't have registry entries for your games.
2008-03-30T02:36:00.000Z	soundray	stephan	yes. You will need ntfs-3g to mount the XP installation read-write
