2011-12-09T03:48:00.000Z	StepNjump		Oh I'm confused webnet. If you look at my first pastie.org, the home says 82 G I think and then when you look in the two profiles, it adds up to much less
2011-12-09T03:48:00.000Z	oCean	StepNjump	especially in /home, there might be (large?) files in hidden directories (starting with a dot, like .VirtualBox)
2011-12-09T03:49:00.000Z	oCean	StepNjump	not in  du -sk *   but try   du -sk .*

2011-12-09T03:52:00.000Z	oCean	StepNjump	imbezol I usually use http://paste.ubuntu.com/764341/
2011-12-09T03:53:00.000Z	oCean	StepNjump	sorry.. did what?
2011-12-09T03:54:00.000Z	oCean	StepNjump	ah well, many pastebins can be used
2011-12-09T03:54:00.000Z	StepNjump	oCean	another guy who helped earlier asked me to use pastie.org so that's why... Ok I might drop off.. I realized that weechat seems to be mounted on the partition I am trying to salvage. I will umount the partition. If I drop, you will know why! (running on a live USB)
2011-12-09T03:59:00.000Z	StepNjump	oCean	I guess there is no way to find out what's in this .encryptfs unless I find my passphrase eh?
2012-02-05T20:18:00.000Z	oCean	StepNjump	which libreoffice
2012-02-05T20:19:00.000Z	oCean	StepNjump	that is an actual command ^
2012-02-05T20:20:00.000Z	StepNjump	oCean	I lost my libre office and a whole bunch of things in my application menu. I would like to add them back in there but when I do whereis libreoffice, it's not that
2012-02-05T20:22:00.000Z	oCean	StepNjump	what does  dpkg -l libreoffice-common  say? Is it still installed?
2012-02-05T20:25:00.000Z	oCean	StepNjump	but what are the first characters on that line?
2012-02-05T20:25:00.000Z	StepNjump	oCean	rc  libreoffice-common                1:3.3.4-0ubuntu1                  office productivity suite -- arch-independent files
2012-02-05T20:27:00.000Z	oCean	StepNjump	see, it's not properly installed
2012-02-05T20:27:00.000Z	oCean	StepNjump	I don't know what happened, but the "rc" at the beginning of the line says "removed but config files remain"
2012-02-05T20:28:00.000Z	oCean	StepNjump	try  sudo apt-get install --reinstall libreoffice-common
2012-02-05T20:30:00.000Z	oCean	StepNjump	welcome
