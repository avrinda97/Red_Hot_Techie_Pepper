2008-12-19T00:14:00.000Z	regeya	sankalp	how should I know; I've never packaged anything for debian :-/  sorry, but this isn't a channel of devs + sankalp.  there are many guides online to creating debs though.
2008-12-19T00:16:00.000Z	regeya	sankalp	I don't know if it's pertinent to your program, but if you're just wanting dpkg to handle it, and if it works for that, checkinstall can manage some software...basically if it can be installed with a make install it can usually be handled by checkinstall
