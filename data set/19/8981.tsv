2007-07-21T13:18:00.000Z	teer2		Could someone with Firefox & Totem plug-in take a look at this page, and tell me if it works for them?  http://metavid.ucsc.edu/wiki_dev/mv_embed/sample_page.php
2007-07-21T13:18:00.000Z	madman91	teer2	on it
2007-07-21T13:19:00.000Z	madman91	teer2	which one should i click on?
2007-07-21T13:19:00.000Z	teer2	madman91	The idea is to see if either the top and or bottom videos work.
2007-07-21T13:19:00.000Z	madman91	teer2	top is working
2007-07-21T13:19:00.000Z	teer2	madman91	For me, only the top does.
2007-07-21T13:19:00.000Z	madman91	teer2	ok.. let me try bottom
2007-07-21T13:19:00.000Z	teer2	madman91	You might have to reload.  Or even restart (if you can)
2007-07-21T13:20:00.000Z	teer2	madman91	*restart the browser
2007-07-21T13:20:00.000Z	madman91	teer2	bottom works as well
2007-07-21T13:20:00.000Z	teer2	madman91	Really!
2007-07-21T13:20:00.000Z	madman91	teer2	for me it does
2007-07-21T13:20:00.000Z	teer2	madman91	Can you play them both at the same time?
2007-07-21T13:20:00.000Z	madman91	teer2	no
2007-07-21T13:20:00.000Z	madman91	teer2	only top or only bottom
2007-07-21T13:21:00.000Z	teer2	madman91	What does you "about:plugins" say for OGG ?  Is it being run by Totem 2.18.1 ?
2007-07-21T13:21:00.000Z	madman91	teer2	its being run by java
2007-07-21T13:22:00.000Z	teer2	madman91	Ah, okay - I need to figure out what package it is so I can install it.  Thanks for your help.
2007-07-21T13:22:00.000Z	madman91	teer2	sure
