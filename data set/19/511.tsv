2012-01-23T03:11:00.000Z	mikePfeiffer1827		help?. How can I move icons around on the launcher and also view hidden files and folders in my Home Folder?
2012-01-23T03:13:00.000Z	urlin2u	mikePfeiffer1827	heh you get the ms to boot?
2012-01-23T03:30:00.000Z	urlin2u	mikePfeiffer1827	you still have the bootscript results.txt?
2012-01-23T03:32:00.000Z	urlin2u	mikePfeiffer1827	you could of just reloaded grub.,
2012-01-23T03:33:00.000Z	mikePfeiffer1827	urlin2u	I don't know much about reloading grub.
2012-01-23T03:34:00.000Z	urlin2u	mikePfeiffer1827	you didn't need to reinstall I only told you how to load the ms boot to the mbr, grub can be reloaded easily, but I understand if you didn't kno how.
2012-01-23T03:35:00.000Z	mikePfeiffer1827	urlin2u	I followed your instructions posted yesterday and is said windows sucessfully recovered
2012-01-23T03:35:00.000Z	mikePfeiffer1827	urlin2u	however i restarted and got a blank screen
2012-01-23T03:36:00.000Z	mikePfeiffer1827	urlin2u	nothing booted, so I reinstalled Ubuntu
2012-01-23T03:36:00.000Z	urlin2u	mikePfeiffer1827	still wouldn't boot though, bummer. There are  great helpers for this on the ##windows channel i would try there for the XP booting.
2012-01-23T03:37:00.000Z	mikePfeiffer1827	urlin2u	There was the Bios Scan and then a blank/black screen
2012-01-23T03:37:00.000Z	mikePfeiffer1827	urlin2u	I will try ##windows channel
2012-01-23T03:38:00.000Z	urlin2u	mikePfeiffer1827	with the ms boot loaded?
2012-01-23T03:39:00.000Z	mikePfeiffer1827	urlin2u	you mean with the boot CD in? I took out the CD after the repair finished and restarted
2012-01-23T03:40:00.000Z	urlin2u	mikePfeiffer1827	no after you ran the fixmbr.
2012-01-23T03:40:00.000Z	mikePfeiffer1827	urlin2u	after I ran fixmbr, I ran fixboot C:
2012-01-23T03:42:00.000Z	urlin2u	mikePfeiffer1827	did you notice that was a secondary command and the fixmbr alone generally works.
2012-01-23T03:43:00.000Z	mikePfeiffer1827	urlin2u	no I did not realise
2012-01-23T03:44:00.000Z	urlin2u	mikePfeiffer1827	cool yeah if XP worked before it is probably fixable but you need a windows pro.
