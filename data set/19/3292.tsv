2009-09-18T17:32:00.000Z	psinetic		:( someone help pls :(
2009-09-18T17:33:00.000Z	psinetic		i just got ubuntu (have no idea how to use it). it didn't support my drivers (Nvidia) and one of my friends who isn't on right now told me to get the package from the site, i don't know what type of card i have is, so i just grabbed one (STUPID!!!!), and i went through an hour just to figure out how to install it, back and forth, omg it was annoying, and finally got it....but it's the wrong driver and i'm lost and frustrated :(
2009-09-18T17:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	psinetic	 gee.. for my nvidia cards on ubuntu. I just run that hardware-manager tool.. and click click.. done..
2009-09-18T17:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	psinetic	 the users can run nvidia-settings and set their own res.
2009-09-18T17:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	psinetic	 and why do you need a firewall? :)
2009-09-18T18:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	psinetic	 MSN may of changed protocalls and  older unoffical clients may not work  - (its happened in the past)
2009-09-18T18:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	psinetic	 find a newer updated version of whatever app ayou are trying.. is one way..  check the apps homepage/forums  for info  there may be some other work arounds
2009-10-23T17:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	psinetic	 or learn some linux.. Ive missed the original question. :)
2009-10-23T17:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	psinetic	 use the search feature to  search for xine. Now why you WANT xine - ive no idea
2009-10-23T17:55:00.000Z	psinetic	Dr_Willis	i'm trying to play a dvd, ActionParsnip1 helped me figure out how to do that, and now i realized it's in Danish language and i need to enable the english subbies.
2009-10-23T17:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	psinetic	  there is the !DVD factoid/web site with some info you may want to read.
2009-10-23T17:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	psinetic	 i just use dvdrip to rip them to avi and then put the disk away...
2009-10-23T18:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	psinetic	 theres also the decss stuff you have to isntall from medibuntu
2009-10-23T18:06:00.000Z	psinetic	Dr_Willis	yes.
2009-10-23T18:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	psinetic	 You could of stated that clearer earlier..  if its playing in vlc, or mplayer  they are both vbery good about having subtitle optionbs in the menus.. good luck.  Other then that. No idea
2009-10-23T18:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	psinetic	 smplayer i think has a feature to find/download subtitles for many movies also.,
2009-10-23T18:08:00.000Z	psinetic	Dr_Willis	it doesn't play in vlc, totem, or gmplayer, only in command line based mplayer which requires me to directly find a specific subtitle file which i can't find on the dvd. llutz, wtfever, ok?
2009-10-23T18:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	psinetic	 thats very weird. because gmplayer is identical to the command line mplayer.
2009-10-23T18:11:00.000Z	psinetic	Dr_Willis	doesn't work though
