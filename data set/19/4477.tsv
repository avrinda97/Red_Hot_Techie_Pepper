2012-03-30T10:38:00.000Z	sacarlson	jessie	it might require some changes in bios settings to change boot sequence to boot usb first

2012-03-30T15:44:00.000Z	sacarlson	jessie	also you saying it doesn't boot give us very little info to deal with
2012-03-30T15:45:00.000Z	sacarlson	jessie	not booting?  do you see a black screen in boot?  does it boot something else other than ubuntu?   does it give any error messages
2012-03-30T15:46:00.000Z	sacarlson	jessie	didn't boot?  if not boot what did it do?
2012-03-30T15:48:00.000Z	sacarlson	jessie	ok then you need to setup bios as shown above
2012-03-30T15:48:00.000Z	jessie	sacarlson	:sure im going thru it
2012-03-30T15:49:00.000Z	sacarlson	jessie	ok and all bios are different so you might have to explore the bios options
