2011-06-26T01:27:00.000Z	maheanuu	edbian	When I go to /places/downloads and rt. c lk on it it opens up eye of gnome image viewer instead of the download folder
2011-06-26T01:28:00.000Z	edbian	maheanuu	So you're trying to open a folder and it's trying to use eye of gnome to view it (obviously wrong)
2011-06-26T01:28:00.000Z	maheanuu	edbian	Yes, exactly
