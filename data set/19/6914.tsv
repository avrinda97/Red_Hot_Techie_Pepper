2007-11-22T17:23:00.000Z	clouse		Also once you have Ubuntu setup exactly the way you wont it can you just image that install and then re-image any computer a will?
2007-11-22T17:24:00.000Z	kbrooks	clouse	no.
2007-11-22T17:25:00.000Z	kbrooks	clouse	well, you can, but it won't redetect new hardware.
2007-11-22T17:25:00.000Z	clouse	kbrooks	That was my next questioin.
2007-11-22T17:25:00.000Z	kbrooks	clouse	so you want to put the image to use in exactly the same computer.
2007-11-22T17:26:00.000Z	clouse	kbrooks	Sure, I will need that kind of back ability in the future.
2007-11-22T17:30:00.000Z	clouse	kbrooks	But what I am setting out to learn is how to set an install with all the options the way I want them, such as the correct dictionary in writer and other thing like that. Is this possible? And if so where do I start?
2007-11-22T17:32:00.000Z	kbrooks	clouse	umm, let me get this straight. you want to do something like install programs while you are installing ubuntu, configure them etc?
2007-11-22T17:35:00.000Z	clouse	kbrooks	Yar that kind of thing, something is coming up where I will have to install Ubuntu on tens of computers a week so it would must for me to automate the process.
2007-11-22T17:36:00.000Z	kbrooks	clouse	you can do that by making a new CD from the desired ubuntu distribution and changing it a little

2007-11-22T17:39:00.000Z	clouse	kbrooks	Really? You mean Ubuntu adapts?
2007-11-22T17:40:00.000Z	kbrooks	clouse	i'm talking about the above link. for creating a new live cd, you dont need to worry about hardware
