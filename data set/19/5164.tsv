2010-10-15T09:24:00.000Z	MonthOLDpickle		Hello?
2010-10-15T09:24:00.000Z	MonthOLDpickle		May I ask a question
2010-10-15T09:25:00.000Z	MonthOLDpickle		Is there a guide for after an installtion? I just installed ubuntu and I want codecs and learn how to tweak my OS.
2010-10-15T09:26:00.000Z	Aemaeth	MonthOLDpickle	sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras
2010-10-15T09:28:00.000Z	MonthOLDpickle	Aemaeth	doing that right now
2010-10-15T09:29:00.000Z	Aemaeth	MonthOLDpickle	and as far as tweaks, not sure if there is any specific guide, but can decide what needs changing and google for a fix
2010-10-15T09:29:00.000Z	Aemaeth	MonthOLDpickle	i think restricted extras takes care of that
2010-10-15T09:31:00.000Z	Aemaeth	MonthOLDpickle	sudo apt-get install chromium-browser
2010-10-15T09:32:00.000Z	Aemaeth	MonthOLDpickle	if you can use apt-get or synaptic it can keep it up to date for you
2010-10-15T09:32:00.000Z	Aemaeth	MonthOLDpickle	not same thing?
2010-10-15T09:33:00.000Z	Aemaeth	MonthOLDpickle	well, then the update manager handles it
2010-10-15T09:38:00.000Z	Aemaeth	MonthOLDpickle	purge will completely remove, as far as i know
2010-10-15T09:39:00.000Z	Aemaeth	MonthOLDpickle	sudo apt-get purge empathy  it just takes out some config files that might otherwise stay afaik, so remove can be just as good unless you're never going back
2010-10-15T09:40:00.000Z	Aemaeth	MonthOLDpickle	also, sudo apt-get autoremove
2010-10-15T09:41:00.000Z	Aemaeth	MonthOLDpickle	and you can type "man " followed by the program name to read the manual entry for most cli programs
2010-10-15T09:49:00.000Z	Aemaeth	MonthOLDpickle	you could run your own games on dreamcast
2010-10-15T09:55:00.000Z	Aemaeth	MonthOLDpickle	use links2 for less bloat
2010-10-15T12:13:00.000Z	Aemaeth	MonthOLDpickle	been a while since i looked into that, there's that grat cd
2010-10-15T12:23:00.000Z	Aemaeth	MonthOLDpickle	i vomited a little
