2009-07-01T03:16:00.000Z	mcalamelli	coleys	another tip, using another wifi, and my nokia, all works fine
2009-07-01T03:13:00.000Z	coleys	mcalamelli	What browser?
2009-07-01T03:13:00.000Z	mcalamelli	coleys	both firefox and opera
2009-07-01T03:13:00.000Z	coleys	mcalamelli	Whats the issue? Like... facebook isn't loading or..?
2009-07-01T03:14:00.000Z	mcalamelli	coleys	i can't login in fb, and one issue in the wordpress dashboard
2009-07-01T03:14:00.000Z	mcalamelli	coleys	i can create a new draft, but i can't save it
2009-07-01T03:14:00.000Z	coleys	mcalamelli	Uhh... It should work fine... I dont think fb requires flash or anything. Have your parents blocked you from fb =p?
2009-07-01T03:15:00.000Z	mcalamelli	coleys	no blocks, also tested firefox as root
2009-07-01T03:16:00.000Z	coleys	mcalamelli	Welll I dont thiink facebook is broken on jaunty... otherwise there would be a "pandemix /omg
2009-07-01T03:17:00.000Z	mcalamelli	coleys	i know that :) anyway, this is really strange
2009-07-01T03:17:00.000Z	coleys	mcalamelli	Well you could try some more browsers see if you get same situation... (Like epiphany and Konqueror)
2009-07-01T03:18:00.000Z	mcalamelli	coleys	ephipany does the same result
2009-07-01T03:18:00.000Z	coleys	mcalamelli	Give konqueror a try.
2009-07-01T03:18:00.000Z	mcalamelli	coleys	uhm, a lot of extra packages to add...
2009-07-01T03:19:00.000Z	coleys	mcalamelli	Yeah, its kde. =o
2009-07-01T03:21:00.000Z	mcalamelli	coleys	isn't opera enough as test?
2009-07-01T03:22:00.000Z	coleys	mcalamelli	Well there shouldn't really be a problem with facebook. So really this is just troubleshooting...
2009-07-01T03:22:00.000Z	mcalamelli	coleys	k. i'll try to debug the connection using wireshark
2009-07-01T03:23:00.000Z	mcalamelli	coleys	if i can't get nothing interesting, i'll start with kdeisms...
