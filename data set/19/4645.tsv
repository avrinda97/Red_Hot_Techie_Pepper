2010-02-28T17:11:00.000Z	erUSUL	frankS2	if you are going to use that only in linux is better not to. Use linux software raid stack

2010-02-28T17:12:00.000Z	erUSUL	frankS2	then cnfigure the sata controller as ahci or normal sata (not raid) and assemble a raid array for linux to use using mdadm

2010-02-28T17:22:00.000Z	erUSUL	frankS2	create new parition tables in both devices. with gparted
2010-02-28T17:23:00.000Z	frankS2	erUSUL	i can do that with sdb , but i cant format it, in sdc i get the error: FATAL ERROR: Bad primary partition 3: Partition ends in the final partial cylinder
2010-02-28T17:23:00.000Z	erUSUL	frankS2	that's why i ask you to make new parition tables (not new paritions)
2010-02-28T17:23:00.000Z	erUSUL	frankS2	that's why i ask you to make new parition tables (not new partitions)

2010-02-28T17:25:00.000Z	erUSUL	frankS2	gparted (gui) or parted (cli)
