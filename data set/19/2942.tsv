2010-05-17T09:59:00.000Z	shawnboy		Anybody know how to fix MPlayer errors "initializing video filters (-vf) and video output (-vo)"?
2010-05-17T09:59:00.000Z	ayi	shawnboy	those are errors?
2010-05-17T10:00:00.000Z	shawnboy	ayi	yes when I try to play H264 video. The same video works in Movie Player.
2010-05-17T10:01:00.000Z	ayi	shawnboy	are you using mplayer from command line or GUI like gmplayer?
2010-05-17T10:01:00.000Z	shawnboy		GUI from Apps/Sound-Video
2010-05-17T10:02:00.000Z	shawnboy	ayi	and I have ubuntu-restriced-extras installed, by the way.
2010-05-17T10:02:00.000Z	ayi	shawnboy	In you open the preferences/options in the mplayer gui, you can select video out device. Try "xv"
2010-05-17T10:02:00.000Z	ayi		If*
2010-05-17T10:05:00.000Z	shawnboy	ayi	When I go to Video tab in Prefs, and highlight xv, I get error: "interrupted by signal 11 in module: unknown" then crash.
2010-05-17T10:06:00.000Z	ayi	shawnboy	that's very odd, try opengl
2010-05-17T10:07:00.000Z	shawnboy	ayi	exact same result.
2010-05-17T10:08:00.000Z	ayi	shawnboy	what if you pick x11?
2010-05-17T10:09:00.000Z	shawnboy	ayi	actually now it does that after a few seconds of being open, without changing anything. I didn't know it was this bad!
2010-05-17T10:11:00.000Z	shawnboy	ayi	I tried a different format just for test--an avi. same erro about initializing video filters and video output.
2010-05-17T10:12:00.000Z	ayi	shawnboy	try from command line, e.g: "mplayer -vo xv myvideofile.mpg"
2010-05-17T10:13:00.000Z	shawnboy	ayi	it successfully played an OGV file using that method. Now I'll try H264
2010-05-17T10:15:00.000Z	shawnboy	ayi	HEY. It works. That's something. But does that give you a clue what's going on when I start from GUI or how to fix?
2010-05-17T10:16:00.000Z	ayi	shawnboy	your mplayer GUI is segfaulting for some reason, i.e writing outside it's memory. You could try a different mplayer GUI
2010-05-17T10:16:00.000Z	shawnboy	ayi	I thought that GUI was MPlayer. So the GUI is separate? MPlayer is CLI?
