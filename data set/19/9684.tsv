2006-12-27T14:14:00.000Z	violot		Anyone know the answer to my Evolution problem?
2006-12-27T14:15:00.000Z	violot		Goodbye
2006-12-27T14:15:00.000Z	violot		Anyone know how to get a stored password in Evolution?
2006-12-27T14:17:00.000Z	cge	violot	From my cursory and outdated knowledge of Evolution, which is made yet more inaccurate by my dislike for the program, I believe that it stores passwords in GNOME's keyring, in which case you could use gnome-keyring-manager to obtain the passwords.
2006-12-27T14:18:00.000Z	cge	violot	Wireshark would work.
2006-12-27T14:18:00.000Z	cge	violot	dsniff might be easier.
2006-12-27T14:19:00.000Z	cge	violot	dsniff isn't a general sniffing program - it looks specifically for passwords.
2006-12-27T14:23:00.000Z	cge	violot	Dsniff probably doesn't show it because it isn't in plaintext.
2006-12-27T14:25:00.000Z	cge	violot	You could change the options in evolution.
2006-12-27T14:27:00.000Z	violot	cge	Change what options?
2006-12-27T14:27:00.000Z	cge	violot	The server settings.
2006-12-27T14:28:00.000Z	cge	violot	Password type
2006-12-27T14:29:00.000Z	cge	violot	If I remember correctly some sort of trivial reversible hashing is used. Let me think of other ways.
2006-12-27T14:33:00.000Z	cge	violot	Use gconf-editor to look in the evolution settings.
2006-12-27T14:34:00.000Z	cge	violot	I'm having trouble testing since the only IMAP server on my local network only runs with SSL.
2006-12-27T14:34:00.000Z	violot	cge	There doesn't seem to be anything holding my passwords :|
2006-12-27T14:36:00.000Z	cge	violot	Let me find a server I can safely log into in plain text.
2006-12-27T14:38:00.000Z	violot	cge	Found it
2006-12-27T14:39:00.000Z	cge	violot	Ah, I remember that directory.
