2005-08-07T14:32:00.000Z	PM-aSeepin		what do you need crossover office for?
2005-08-07T14:32:00.000Z	PM-aSeepin		it doesn't do anything wine can't do :>
2005-08-07T14:32:00.000Z	PM-aSeepin		just with wine you have to do it all by hand ;)
2005-08-07T14:32:00.000Z	PM-aSeepin		like what?
2005-08-07T14:33:00.000Z	PM-aSeepin		yah you use synaptic for everything else :)
2005-08-07T14:33:00.000Z	PM-aSeepin		i should write a sources.list manager
2005-08-07T14:33:00.000Z	PM-aSeepin		I think I will
2005-08-07T14:34:00.000Z	PM-aSeepin		someone should hack kuser or the gnome um or both and add in /etc/sudoers permissions
2005-08-07T14:34:00.000Z	PM-aSeepin		as settings
2005-08-07T14:35:00.000Z	Burgundavia	PM-aSeepin	what do you mean?
2005-08-07T14:35:00.000Z	PM-aSeepin	Burgundavia	 someone should modify the popular user managers, and add in settings for that person in /etc/sudoers.. the options selected would be added to /etc/sudoers
2005-08-07T14:36:00.000Z	Burgundavia	PM-aSeepin	it is alreayd there
2005-08-07T14:36:00.000Z	Burgundavia	PM-aSeepin	gnome
2005-08-07T14:37:00.000Z	Burgundavia	PM-aSeepin	properities --> user privs --> executing system administaration...
2005-08-07T14:39:00.000Z	Burgundavia	PM-aSeepin	you want finegrained control over the sudo file?
2005-08-07T14:41:00.000Z	PM-aSeepin	Burgundavia	 but still easy for anybody to use.. it would actually be reallye asy to write in python
2005-08-07T14:47:00.000Z	Burgundavia	PM-aSeepin	aptitude uses the same backend as any of the dpkg utilities
2005-08-07T14:49:00.000Z	PM-aSeepin	Burgundavia	 yeah, but aptitude tracks dependencies differently. it also behaves a little differently
