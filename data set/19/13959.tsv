2008-09-08T05:25:00.000Z	dr_willis	zammyking111	 clarify the issue/problem.
2008-09-08T05:25:00.000Z	dr_willis	zammyking111	 'not so big' is very vague
2008-09-08T05:26:00.000Z	dr_willis	zammyking111	 increase your screen display size?
2008-09-08T05:31:00.000Z	dr_willis	zammyking111	 if your system is running at a lower then it should res. You may need to install the proper video card drivers. and use the settings tools to select a higher res.
2008-09-08T05:34:00.000Z	dr_willis	zammyking111	 and your video card is a ?
2008-09-08T05:34:00.000Z	dr_willis	zammyking111	 care to be more specific?    check the  following urls for installing nvidia card drivers...
2008-09-08T05:39:00.000Z	dr_willis	zammyking111	 install the proper nvidia drivers for the card. for starters. untill you get them installed/working. You wont be making full use of your card.
2008-09-08T05:39:00.000Z	dr_willis	zammyking111	 theres a hardware-manager tool in the menus that 'should' see/install the proper drivers.
2008-09-08T05:40:00.000Z	dr_willis	zammyking111	 'using a disk that came with the card' is windows thinking.. thers no need for it. It could be that card is one of the problemmatic cards. and you may need to use the envyng tool.
2008-09-08T05:41:00.000Z	dr_willis	zammyking111	 you need to install the proper nvidia drivers  reguardless...
2008-09-08T05:42:00.000Z	dr_willis	zammyking111	 No.. You would read the !nvidia bot link/url and read a little bit.  its very likely that 'sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx-new' will install the drivers.. but You should read and double check for your SPECIFIC video card.
2008-09-08T05:51:00.000Z	dr_willis	zammyking111	 that question made no sence.. and thats a SUN web site . so its not ubuntu related at all.
2008-09-08T05:52:00.000Z	dr_willis	zammyking111	 sun is not in any way  goingto apply to linux drivers...
2008-09-08T05:53:00.000Z	dr_willis	zammyking111	 you most likely  need to install the nvidia-glx-new package, like i stated earlier.
2008-09-08T05:53:00.000Z	dr_willis	zammyking111	 the package manager tool.. or use the exact command i gave earlier.
2008-09-08T05:53:00.000Z	dr_willis	zammyking111	 No.. You would read the !nvidia bot link/url and read a little bit.  its very likely that 'sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx-new' will install the drivers.. but You should read and double check for your SPECIFIC video card.
2008-09-08T05:57:00.000Z	dr_willis	zammyking111	 that !nvidia url/guide i gave earlier - would of told you - to reboot.
