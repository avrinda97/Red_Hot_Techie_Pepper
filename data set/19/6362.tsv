2008-04-27T18:12:00.000Z	john47		hi all....ok this has been a real pain with Hardy Wubi install: I have read/write access to the shared Windows partition only as root.  How can I get read/write file access from my regular user account?
2008-04-27T18:12:00.000Z	mut80r	john47	 gksudo gedit /etc/fstab
2008-04-27T18:12:00.000Z	john47	mut80r	yeah, got that far....now what?
2008-04-27T18:12:00.000Z	mut80r	john47	change gid=47 to gid=1000
2008-04-27T18:13:00.000Z	mut80r	john47	or whatever your user id is from users and groups under administration
2008-04-27T18:13:00.000Z	mut80r	john47	also add a comma and uid=1000   (or whatever your user id is)
2008-04-27T18:13:00.000Z	john47	mut80r	hmmm...those numbers are not in my fstab file
2008-04-27T18:14:00.000Z	mut80r	john47	should be something like this:   UUID=xxxxxxblah   /mountpoint    ntfs    blahblah,gid=47
2008-04-27T18:14:00.000Z	john47	mut80r	see, it's all different because I haven't partitioned the hd, I just did the wubi install
2008-04-27T18:15:00.000Z	john47	mut80r	should I try to post my fstab here???
2008-04-27T18:15:00.000Z	mut80r	john47	ah. I don't know anything about wubi. don't post fstab here though. use the pastebin
2008-04-27T18:21:00.000Z	mut80r	john47	that is one weird fstab. is your windows install on the same disk ?
2008-04-27T18:21:00.000Z	john47	mut80r	yes, that's how wubi works, to the best of my knowledge.
2008-04-27T18:22:00.000Z	mut80r	john47	like I said, I don't know anything about wubi, I installed from the CD .ISO before windows loaded. best to wait until someone else who knows can help rather than potentially screw something up.
2008-04-27T18:23:00.000Z	john47	mut80r	Maybe I should go at this problem a different way.  What would cause the user account not to have read/write permission but would allow the root account to do so?
2008-04-27T18:23:00.000Z	mut80r	john47	that's default behaviour.
2008-04-27T18:24:00.000Z	john47	mut80r	thanks for your thoughts - oh, and I guess changing the default behavior involves changing the fstab, right?
2008-04-27T18:24:00.000Z	john47	mut80r	and that's what's weird about my fstab....*sigh* Thanks for your thoughts.
2008-04-27T18:25:00.000Z	mut80r	john47	yes, the only way to take ownership of the partition and retain it on next restart is to edit fstab
