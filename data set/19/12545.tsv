2005-08-31T08:50:00.000Z	TraceGreen	bob2	sorry, but what is breezy?
2005-08-31T08:51:00.000Z	TraceGreen	bob2	nice to meet you, you helped me a lot .:-)
2005-09-20T09:28:00.000Z	bob2	TraceGreen	you can install anything you like on it, if you have enough ram
2005-09-20T09:29:00.000Z	TraceGreen	bob2	Do you mean i can apt-get install in liveCD?
2005-09-20T09:29:00.000Z	bob2	TraceGreen	yes
2005-10-01T07:36:00.000Z	bob2	TraceGreen	not really
2005-10-01T07:36:00.000Z	bob2	TraceGreen	there are various dodgy hacks, but none are as simple as rebooting ;)
2005-10-01T07:36:00.000Z	TraceGreen	bob2	if Windows filesystem is fat32, so, edit it in wine is ok, is it?
2005-10-01T07:37:00.000Z	bob2	TraceGreen	yup
2005-10-01T07:37:00.000Z	TraceGreen	bob2	thanks!
2005-10-01T07:43:00.000Z	bob2	TraceGreen	wine has it's own fake registry, aiui
2005-10-01T07:44:00.000Z	TraceGreen	bob2	is the fake registry the same with my real registry if i mount my windows system?
2005-10-01T07:44:00.000Z	bob2	TraceGreen	no
2005-10-01T07:45:00.000Z	TraceGreen	bob2	so, do you mean i just edit my fake registry in linux?
2005-10-01T07:45:00.000Z	bob2	TraceGreen	I don't know how you'd point regedit at the real one
2005-10-01T07:45:00.000Z	bob2	TraceGreen	I'd guess editing the wine config would be enough
2005-10-01T07:45:00.000Z	TraceGreen	bob2	thanks!!
