2007-12-19T23:07:00.000Z	Ayabara	Slart	bazhang, thanks
2008-03-12T01:19:00.000Z	Slart	Ayabara	there is something called audio convert.. or something like that.. I can never remember
2008-03-12T01:20:00.000Z	Ayabara	Slart	ok
2008-03-12T01:21:00.000Z	Ayabara	Slart	soundconverter is in the repo. maybe that one :-)
2008-03-12T01:21:00.000Z	Slart	Ayabara	sounds like a good candidate =)
2008-03-26T11:10:00.000Z	Slart	Ayabara	cp can't do it.. but you can use rsync .. but most workarounds like this gives you about 30% longer copying times.. your choice
2008-03-26T11:10:00.000Z	Ayabara	Slart	than cp it is :-)
2008-03-26T11:10:00.000Z	Slart	Ayabara	indeed.. 30% longer copying times compared to cp
2008-06-19T00:07:00.000Z	Slart	Ayabara	rtorrent is as cool as a station wagon.. it does the job but the coolness factor isn't really through the roof =)
2008-06-19T00:08:00.000Z	Ayabara	Slart	I see your poing :-). I tried Deluge and Ktorrent as well, but rtorrent still is my preferred choice. Any other good ones out there?

2008-06-19T00:09:00.000Z	Slart	Ayabara	I use azureus at the moment.. used utorrent back when I was a windows user.. some say you can still run it using wine
2008-06-19T00:09:00.000Z	Slart	Ayabara	oh.. adn I used rtorrent a short while =)
2008-06-19T00:11:00.000Z	Ayabara	Slart	is azureus still a resource hog?
2008-06-19T00:12:00.000Z	Slart	Ayabara	it isn't that bad.. I don't know what they've done with it..
2008-06-19T00:12:00.000Z	Slart	Ayabara	perhaps java has improved on linux.. or the azureus people have stopped coding while drunk
2008-06-19T00:12:00.000Z	Ayabara	Slart	hehe
2008-08-04T16:46:00.000Z	Slart	Ayabara	you could try lsof.. it lists all files opened by processes.. mix with grep and you might find something
