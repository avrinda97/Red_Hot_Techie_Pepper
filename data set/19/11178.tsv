2008-10-20T22:37:00.000Z	ozzloy		uname -r tell me i have 2.6.24-19-generic as my kernel, but on another machine i have 2.6.24-21-generic
2008-10-20T22:37:00.000Z	ozzloy		why?
2008-10-20T22:39:00.000Z	ozzloy		actually my real goal is to get VirtualBox working
2008-10-20T22:40:00.000Z	ozzloy		if so, how do i convert this box to a full on ubuntu box without wiping/reinstalling?
2008-10-20T22:40:00.000Z	Scunizi	ozzloy	you trying to get vbox working now or are you working on a different issue?
2008-10-20T22:41:00.000Z	ozzloy	Scunizi	i'm very much trying to get vbox working
2008-10-20T22:43:00.000Z	ozzloy	Scunizi	software sources has all the sources checked
2008-10-20T22:44:00.000Z	Scunizi	ozzloy	if it's installed and you're getting kernel errors search synaptic for virtualbox and you'll see the appropriate kernel driver to load with your current kernel.
2008-10-20T22:47:00.000Z	Scunizi	ozzloy	noodlesgc you need the "virtualbox-ose-guest-modules-2.6.24-21-generic" in Synaptic
2008-10-20T22:49:00.000Z	Scunizi	ozzloy	so you installed vbox and you get an error.. have you installed the module I mentioned yet?
2008-10-20T22:50:00.000Z	Scunizi	ozzloy	ok.. the one you want is on the vbox site.. not the one in synaptic..
2008-10-20T22:52:00.000Z	Scunizi	ozzloy	also look here for advice.. look further down on the page where they talk about the .deb available on their site and it's added benefits.
2008-10-20T22:52:00.000Z	Scunizi	ozzloy	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VirtualBox
2008-10-20T22:53:00.000Z	ozzloy	Scunizi	the first thing it tells me to do is apt-get install virtualbox-ose-modules-`uname -r`, but no such package exists
2008-10-20T22:54:00.000Z	Scunizi	ozzloy	here's a better tutorial http://www.ubuntu-unleashed.com/2008/04/howto-install-virtualbox-in-hardy-heron.html
2008-10-20T22:54:00.000Z	ozzloy	Scunizi	oh cool.  looks promising.  thanks
2008-10-20T22:55:00.000Z	Scunizi	ozzloy	np.. that last page you were looking at you didn't read it all. further down talks about getting the package directly from vbox which I think is what the new tutorial does.
2008-10-20T22:56:00.000Z	ozzloy	Scunizi	i did read that, but i wanted to try the repo packages route if i could
2008-10-20T22:57:00.000Z	Scunizi	ozzloy	the repo version doesn't have usb support that's the primary difference.. Aside from the version of the package which is newer on the vbox site.
