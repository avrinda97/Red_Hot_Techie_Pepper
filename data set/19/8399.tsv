2007-07-17T15:48:00.000Z	gordonjcp		is there a channel more specific to Ubuntu and PHP?
2007-07-17T07:02:00.000Z	aricz	gordonjcp	: only cdrom and floppy there
2007-07-17T07:02:00.000Z	gordonjcp	aricz	have a look in /media
2007-07-17T07:02:00.000Z	gordonjcp	aricz	ok, you need to mount it.  Did an icon appear for it on the desktop?
2007-07-17T07:03:00.000Z	aricz	gordonjcp	: yep, it found the camera and pics in X.. but I want to copy from "ordinary" console instead, if it can be done.. :)
2007-07-17T07:03:00.000Z	gordonjcp	aricz	when you plug the camera it, it will appear as a disk drive, and then it will be mounted somewhere
2007-07-17T07:04:00.000Z	gordonjcp	aricz	have a look at the cdrom and floppy just in case it's mounted it there
2007-07-17T07:04:00.000Z	aricz	gordonjcp	: I checked, nothing there
2007-07-17T07:05:00.000Z	gordonjcp	aricz	what does mount say?
2007-07-17T07:06:00.000Z	aricz	gordonjcp	: oh, what was that paste-url again? :)
2007-07-17T07:09:00.000Z	aricz	gordonjcp	: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/30217/plain/
2007-07-17T07:10:00.000Z	gordonjcp	aricz	bizarre, it doesn't look like it's mounted at all
2007-07-17T07:11:00.000Z	gordonjcp	aricz	and you can get to it from an icon on the desktop?
2007-07-17T07:11:00.000Z	aricz	gordonjcp	: ahm.. lets see.. :|
2007-07-17T07:12:00.000Z	aricz	gordonjcp	: I think I answered wrong to a question earlier.. when I turn on the camera, ubuntu autodetects the camera and loads the pics/vids.. but lets see if I can find an icon .. :)
2007-07-17T07:14:00.000Z	aricz	gordonjcp	: I see no icons, where am I supposed to see it by the way?
2007-07-17T07:14:00.000Z	aricz	gordonjcp	: it loads 'Import Photos'
2007-07-17T07:15:00.000Z	gordonjcp	aricz	ok, so it's seeing the camera; cancel "import photos"
2007-07-17T07:16:00.000Z	aricz	gordonjcp	: ok, canceled 'import photos' .. and there was nothing in 'places', just the same as in /media (cdrom, floppy)
