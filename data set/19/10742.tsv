2006-08-15T11:12:00.000Z	erisco		to anyone, what is a wtmp? I figure a type of log... any info on that?
2006-08-15T11:12:00.000Z	Tonren	erisco	What's the context?
2006-08-15T11:12:00.000Z	erisco	Tonren	using -w with the halt command
2006-08-15T11:13:00.000Z	erisco	Tonren	if it can tell me what happens upon shut down it would help a lot, but I do not know where I would access this log afterwards
2006-08-15T11:14:00.000Z	Tonren	erisco	The answer to your question is in the first few lines of "man halt"
2006-08-15T11:16:00.000Z	erisco	Tonren	how do I 'read' this log file?
2006-08-15T11:16:00.000Z	erisco	Tonren	I am trying to get a log of what is happening when my computer shuts down
2006-08-15T11:16:00.000Z	Tonren	erisco	A nice, simple way to read something from terminal is by typing "less (filename)"
2006-08-15T11:17:00.000Z	Tonren	erisco	To navigate less, use J and K to go up and down.  Hit / to search for a string.  g brings you to the top of the document, and G brings you to the bottom.
2006-08-15T11:17:00.000Z	erisco	Tonren	the wtmp file seems to be binary... this certainly isn't what I was going for
2006-08-15T11:18:00.000Z	Tonren	erisco	Ah, I see.  wtmp isn't a log, but a special file used by the BIOS (I presume) to figure out how to boot up again.
2006-08-15T11:18:00.000Z	erisco	Tonren	I really really hope I did not just mess it up... that would be bad
2006-08-15T11:18:00.000Z	Tonren	erisco	Don't worry - less will NEVER harm a file.
2006-08-15T11:18:00.000Z	erisco	Tonren	that isn't the problem, It is the fact I wrote something to it
2006-08-15T11:19:00.000Z	erisco	Tonren	using halt -w
2006-08-15T11:19:00.000Z	Tonren	erisco	THat shouldn't be a problem, I don't think
2006-08-15T11:19:00.000Z	erisco	Tonren	how can I get a log of what happens when my computer shuts down? I need to confirm that everything is being stopped
2006-08-15T11:20:00.000Z	Tonren	erisco	You know, I actually don't know off-hand.  Someone in this room MUST know where the system log lives, though
2006-08-15T11:21:00.000Z	erisco	Tonren	well we found the log file for a boot record. I kinda need the other end of it though hehe
