2006-01-12T13:39:00.000Z	Razor-X		does anyone have an idea why xpdf refuses to refresh the bottom of the document area?
2006-01-12T13:40:00.000Z	Razor-X		I dunno.... xzgv has also been working a bit weird after the Breezy upgrade
2006-01-12T13:40:00.000Z	Razor-X		they both use freetype, I tried reinstalling libfreetype6, but to no avail
2006-01-12T13:40:00.000Z	Razor-X		I think they both use motif, so I reinstalled that too, and same thing
2006-01-12T13:42:00.000Z	Razor-X		I like evince... but I don't use many GTK programs, so it becomes a pain to load it, but evince works perfectly in the few times I tried it
2006-01-12T13:43:00.000Z	Razor-X		I'm looking for another common depend between xzgv and xpdf
2006-01-12T13:45:00.000Z	Razor-X		they both use libx11-6, but that's about all they have in common :(
2006-01-12T13:45:00.000Z	Razor-X		can someone holler out to the MOTU's to do a recompile of libfreetype?
2006-01-12T13:46:00.000Z	ajmitch	Razor-X	eh? why?
2006-01-12T13:46:00.000Z	Razor-X	ajmitch	some of my libfreetype programs are being a little buggy after the Breezy upgrade
2006-01-12T13:46:00.000Z	Razor-X	ajmitch	that, and libx11 are the only common libs I can see in the depends
2006-01-12T13:47:00.000Z	Razor-X		(other than, of course, stuff like libc)
2006-01-12T13:47:00.000Z	Razor-X	ajmitch	xzgv refuses to load more than a screenfull of thumbnails with `u' and xpdf doesen't refresh the bottom inch-or-so of the document
2006-01-12T13:47:00.000Z	ajmitch	Razor-X	and freetype is in main, so complaining to MOTUs won't help - you'd also need to get a bugreport filed as to why you really think it's freetype's fault
2006-01-12T13:47:00.000Z	Razor-X	ajmitch	oh that's right! not MOTU's hmmm
2006-01-12T13:48:00.000Z	Razor-X	ajmitch	you're a MOTU, right?
2006-01-12T13:48:00.000Z	ajmitch	Razor-X	yes
2006-01-12T13:48:00.000Z	Razor-X	ajmitch	you have an idea why it's doing this?
2006-01-12T13:48:00.000Z	ajmitch	Razor-X	no :)
