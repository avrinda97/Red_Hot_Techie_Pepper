2012-07-14T03:06:00.000Z	dagroves	bwat47	I did both of those commands and it worked great but let me restart my computer and I'll see if it works, Then I will get back to you my good sire.
2012-07-14T03:17:00.000Z	dagroves	bwat47	anymore suggestions?
2012-07-14T03:20:00.000Z	dagroves	bwat47	It did work, but it "resets" everytime I reboot, I have to enter that command again and again...

2012-07-14T03:23:00.000Z	dagroves	bwat47	so in that file I remove every thing listed in the blacklist.conf file?
2012-07-14T03:23:00.000Z	dagroves	bwat47	scared I will screw something up lol
2012-07-14T03:26:00.000Z	bwat47	dagroves	dont do anything to the blacklist, he was referring to the stuff he tried in the OP
2012-07-14T03:27:00.000Z	dagroves	bwat47	okay then so I need to add the rt2800usb to modules? how would I do that? I have no idea what I am doing here? lol
2012-07-14T03:29:00.000Z	bwat47	dagroves	echo rt5370rt2800usb >> /etc/modules
2012-07-14T03:30:00.000Z	dagroves	bwat47	now it is telling me "bash: /etc/modules: Permission Denied
2012-07-14T03:33:00.000Z	dagroves	bwat47	okay I did what genii-around said and I am assuming it workd. only way to find out is to restart correct? or am I missing a step?
2012-07-14T03:34:00.000Z	dagroves	bwat47	okay I shall restart and see if it worked!
2012-07-14T03:41:00.000Z	dagroves	bwat47	It worked! It did not work when I rebooted but after I unpluged my USB Adapeter and reinserted it, I was connected. That is good enough for me
