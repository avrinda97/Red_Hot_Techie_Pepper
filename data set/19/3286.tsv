2009-10-07T05:58:00.000Z	Casper1		can some1 help me. Vi isnt displaying the file i opened with it
2009-10-07T05:58:00.000Z	jrib	Casper1	how did you open it?
2009-10-07T05:59:00.000Z	jrib	Casper1	linux is case-sensitive.  You probably meant to type: /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2009-10-07T05:59:00.000Z	Casper1	jrib	k ill try that
2009-10-07T06:00:00.000Z	Casper1	jrib	how do i exit vi
2009-10-07T06:00:00.000Z	Casper1	jrib	or open another file
2009-10-07T06:00:00.000Z	jrib	Casper1	ESCAPE :q ENTER.  Why are you using vi instead of nano?
2009-10-07T06:02:00.000Z	jrib	Casper1	why don't you take a step back and tell us what you are trying to accomplish?
2009-10-07T06:04:00.000Z	jrib	Casper1	nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2009-10-07T06:05:00.000Z	jrib	Casper1	you're being kind of silly.
2009-10-07T06:05:00.000Z	Casper1	jrib	im not making it up
2009-10-07T06:05:00.000Z	jrib	Casper1	you're either making a typo or the file does not exist
2009-10-07T06:06:00.000Z	jrib	Casper1	what does this return: ls -l /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2009-10-07T06:06:00.000Z	Casper1	jrib	im not making it up, theres no typo, and how can xorg.conf not exist
2009-10-07T06:07:00.000Z	Casper1	jrib	-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 2009-10-06 19:24 /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2009-10-07T06:08:00.000Z	jrib	Casper1	seems like everything is right then.  Your file is empty.
2009-10-07T06:09:00.000Z	Casper1	jrib	would that have to do with using an alternate install cd?
2009-10-07T06:09:00.000Z	jrib	Casper1	well you don't need an xorg.conf at all.  I doubt it has anything to do with the use of the alternate cd
2009-10-07T06:10:00.000Z	Casper1	jrib	how would i go about changing the resolution then?
