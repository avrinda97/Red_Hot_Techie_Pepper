2009-09-26T07:20:00.000Z	stevex		Could you make Xubunutu into a file server?
2009-09-26T07:22:00.000Z	stevex		apache2 is I'm assuming file server software?
2009-09-26T07:22:00.000Z	BJJblue	stevex	 apache is a web server
2009-09-26T07:23:00.000Z	BJJblue	stevex	 what do you want to know about it?
2009-09-26T07:24:00.000Z	BJJblue	stevex	 xubuntu is probably okay, but you could go lighter if you wwanted
2009-09-26T07:25:00.000Z	BJJblue	stevex	 there's also crunchbang which is ubuntu based
2009-09-26T07:25:00.000Z	BJJblue	stevex	 try xubuntu and see how that works.  If you want lighter, fluxbox
2009-09-26T07:28:00.000Z	BJJblue	stevex	 yes
2009-09-26T07:28:00.000Z	stevex	BJJblue	same thing with Xubuntu correct?
2009-09-26T07:28:00.000Z	BJJblue	stevex	 they're all the same
2009-09-26T07:28:00.000Z	BJJblue	stevex	 they just have different window managers
2009-09-26T07:29:00.000Z	BJJblue	stevex	 think of desktop environments as 'themes' of sorts, except that it also handles how the windows are drawn and handled
2009-09-26T07:29:00.000Z	BJJblue	stevex	 you'll get there =)
2009-09-26T07:30:00.000Z	BJJblue	stevex	 it's kind of hard to just learn commands.  YOu'll learn them by using them, but there should be a few websites with basic commands
2009-09-26T07:31:00.000Z	BJJblue	stevex	 the reason i say that is because a lot of commands arise from the software installed on the system rather than the system itself.
2009-09-26T07:31:00.000Z	BJJblue	stevex	 are you currently on an ubuntu machine?
2009-09-26T07:31:00.000Z	stevex	BJJblue	nah, my main machine is Vista :(
2009-09-26T07:36:00.000Z	BJJblue	stevex	 just a little semantic point i want to clarify - you are technically trying out linux, but linux is just the kernel (the core of the operating system... it's called NT in windows)  More precisely, you're trying out the Ubuntu linux-distribution
2009-09-26T07:36:00.000Z	stevex	BJJblue	I agree, and user_g, xfburn is good also
