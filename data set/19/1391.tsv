2011-02-03T04:50:00.000Z	quantumtransfer		Hello everyone, I am new to the linux community. I have attempting to run ubuntu 10.10 from a USB drive created by the universal installer from http://www.pendrivelinux.com/. I am having some issues after it boots from the USB as it goes into ubuntu. The screen glitches in purple and green, but I can hear the logon music. The system is frozen after that. I am using x32 version.
2011-02-03T04:50:00.000Z	izinucs	quantumtransfer	what kind of video card do you have?
2011-02-03T04:52:00.000Z	izinucs	quantumtransfer	this might work... do a CTRL+ALT+F2 and it should drop you to a terminal/command prompt asking you to log in.. see if that happens first
2011-02-03T04:53:00.000Z	izinucs	quantumtransfer	use my nick at the beginning when you respond so it highlights me .. easier to see.. to answer the question yes.. but one step at a time.
