2006-01-13T09:44:00.000Z	Madpilot	amicrawler	Universe & Multiverse repos
2006-01-13T10:10:00.000Z	Madpilot	amicrawler	so what're you actually trying to do, aside from offend the channel?
2006-01-13T10:12:00.000Z	Madpilot	amicrawler	 there's something over 15,000 files in the full Ubuntu archives, it's not too restrictive... :P

2006-01-13T10:19:00.000Z	Madpilot	amicrawler	also, https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SynapticHowto and http://wiki.ubuntu.com/AddingRepositoriesHowto
2006-01-13T10:35:00.000Z	Madpilot	amicrawler	totem-xine runs DVDs for me...
2006-01-13T10:41:00.000Z	Madpilot	amicrawler	totem-xine + libdvdread3 plays DVDs fine, it's by far the easiest way to do it...
2006-01-13T10:49:00.000Z	Madpilot	amicrawler	that's not the most exact list... but enable the Universe/Multiverse repos and update, and you should be OK...

2006-05-13T12:09:00.000Z	Madpilot	amicrawler	what app are you looking for?
2006-05-13T12:10:00.000Z	Madpilot	amicrawler	do you have the Universe repo enabled in Ubuntu?
2006-05-13T12:11:00.000Z	Madpilot	amicrawler	which apps, then? (I've never run Suse, got no idea what's available for that distro...)
2006-05-13T12:12:00.000Z	Madpilot	amicrawler	you really do need to be less vague than "anything"...
2006-05-13T12:12:00.000Z	Madpilot	amicrawler	look for .deb files, if you're certain that what you want isn't in Ubuntu's repos...
2006-08-16T11:48:00.000Z	Madpilot	amicrawler	do you mean Synaptic?

2006-08-16T11:53:00.000Z	Madpilot	amicrawler	restricted is enabled by default, multiverse & universe are the two that aren't. Please read the URL I gave you.
2006-08-16T11:54:00.000Z	Madpilot	amicrawler	after you update your repository listings, the stuff in them is visible in synaptic just like everything else
