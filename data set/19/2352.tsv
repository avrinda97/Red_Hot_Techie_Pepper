2010-05-03T03:33:00.000Z	erisco		when I extract an iso that I have all the files are suffixed with ;1, and directories/file names over a length 8 characters are truncated. What is going on?
2010-05-03T03:35:00.000Z	Loshki	erisco	those are truncated dos compatible names. Check the options on your extraction program to use longer names...
2010-05-03T03:37:00.000Z	erisco	Loshki	when I mount my iso I do not have the ;1 suffix problem but do still have truncated names. I am manning mount but cannot figure out how to enable longer names
2010-05-03T03:41:00.000Z	Loshki	erisco	if the CD was burnt without rock-ridge extensions, that may be the best you can do. Where did it come from?
2010-05-03T03:42:00.000Z	erisco	Loshki	it is an image of a retail CD
2010-05-03T03:43:00.000Z	erisco	Loshki	the program on it is windows-based and I can run it in wine. However, the installer is failing because it is looking for files with the full-length name, not the truncated versions
2010-05-03T03:43:00.000Z	erisco	Loshki	my only solution at this point is to keep running the installer and renaming everything it has a problem with... that could take quite some time
2010-05-03T03:44:00.000Z	Loshki	erisco	how do you know which long name to use when you rename?
2010-05-03T03:44:00.000Z	erisco	Loshki	the installer complains saying what file could not be found
2010-05-03T03:45:00.000Z	erisco	Loshki	it is so far though, hopefully it keeps telling me the correct names
2010-05-03T03:46:00.000Z	Loshki	erisco	dunno what to tell you. The 'man mount' page talks about 'Mount options for iso9660' but the defaults should 'do the right thing'. You could try 'check=r' but I'm not convinced it will help...
2010-05-03T04:01:00.000Z	erisco	Loshki	I am not confused as how to supply the dang arguments... I tried mount -o loop -o norock myiso.iso but then it says myiso.iso is not in fstab or mstab... which makes no relevant sense to me
2010-05-03T04:02:00.000Z	Loshki	erisco	try -o loop,norock but I don't think that will do what you want...
2010-05-03T04:03:00.000Z	erisco	Loshki	I get the same output... if I just do -o loop it mounts fine (minus the file/directory name problems)
2010-05-03T04:03:00.000Z	Loshki	erisco	sorry, you've exhausted my expertise...
2010-05-03T04:03:00.000Z	erisco	Loshki	actually, it is not mounting fine, I forgot to specify the mount location
2010-05-03T04:12:00.000Z	erisco	Loshki	is it likely then that the long filename information is permanently lost?
2010-05-03T04:14:00.000Z	Loshki	erisco	that would be my worry, but clearly the installer is expecting long names. Is it possible that whoever made the copy messed up and burnt without rockridge extensions?
2010-05-03T05:02:00.000Z	erisco	Loshki	okay thanks for your help!
