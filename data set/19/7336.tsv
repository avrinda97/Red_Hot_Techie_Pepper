2007-09-08T05:01:00.000Z	tluca1		does anyone know how I can actually get apt to work properly with a Password authenticated proxy?
2007-09-08T05:01:00.000Z	tluca1		I have looked on the web
2007-09-08T05:02:00.000Z	tluca1		nothing has got apt working
2007-09-08T05:03:00.000Z	jrib	tluca1	is 'export http_proxy=http://username:password@proxyserver.net:port/' not working?  Or have you tried using apt.conf?
2007-09-08T05:04:00.000Z	tluca1	jrib	I can't remember, I will try it again
2007-09-08T05:04:00.000Z	tluca1	jrib	where do I put that line?
2007-09-08T05:04:00.000Z	jrib	tluca1	in your shell
2007-09-08T05:05:00.000Z	tluca1	jrib	just type that in directly?
2007-09-08T05:05:00.000Z	jrib	tluca1	yes, that will be enough to test it in that shell
2007-09-08T05:05:00.000Z	tluca1	jrib	I will try now
2007-09-08T05:15:00.000Z	jrib	tluca1	if that command worked, you'll need to make it permanent
2007-09-08T05:16:00.000Z	tluca1	jrib	I don't know yet I have a direct connection as well for now I will need to wait until that is blocked until i test It won't I?
2007-09-08T05:17:00.000Z	jrib	tluca1	oh, ok.  Note taht if you use the gui (system -> preferences -> network proxy  and use "details" to fill in password info), it should work, but you may need to reboot for the settings to take affect in your terminals.
2007-09-08T05:18:00.000Z	tluca1	jrib	oops, should have said (Forgot), i am using KDE
2007-09-08T05:18:00.000Z	tluca1	jrib	the odd thing is thatsome repos work, others don't
2007-09-08T05:18:00.000Z	jrib	tluca1	hmm, there might be some gui there too, but idk
2007-09-08T05:19:00.000Z	tluca1	jrib	'but idk'?
2007-09-08T05:19:00.000Z	jrib	tluca1	but I don't know
2007-09-08T05:19:00.000Z	tluca1	jrib	ok
