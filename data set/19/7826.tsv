2007-06-18T12:39:00.000Z	bsdunix		does ibm still manufacture ppc procs?
2007-06-18T12:40:00.000Z	bsdunix		you, too wols
2007-06-18T12:41:00.000Z	bsdunix		it broke my heart to see apple switch to intel stating that ppc just wasn up to snuff on performance. same occurred with my favorite; alpha
2007-06-18T12:43:00.000Z	bsdunix		apt-getting gnome as we speak
2007-06-18T12:43:00.000Z	bsdunix		i had a girlfriend like that once
2007-06-18T12:45:00.000Z	bsdunix		by the way; ubuntu runs great on my ibm intellistation zpro dual 866 xeon
2007-06-18T12:46:00.000Z	bsdunix		dromer; i think this issue of yours is fixed in your xorg.conf file; set up a monitor0 and a monitor1 as well as screen0 and screen1
2007-06-18T12:47:00.000Z	dromer	bsdunix	instead of using the nvidia-settings I just set it up in there? and enable the twinviem settings?
2007-06-18T12:48:00.000Z	dromer	bsdunix	what about ServerLayout?
2007-06-18T12:48:00.000Z	bsdunix	dromer	use vi and edit file manually per some how-to tutorial
2007-06-18T12:48:00.000Z	dromer	bsdunix	the howto on ubuntuforums didn't work for me
2007-06-18T12:49:00.000Z	dromer	bsdunix	networking?
2007-06-18T12:50:00.000Z	dromer	bsdunix	hmm, I know, but I haven't found anything else that works
2007-06-18T12:51:00.000Z	bsdunix	dromer	somebody out there has posted in some forum (linuxforums.org?) a xinerama layout
2007-06-18T12:51:00.000Z	dromer	bsdunix	ok, I'm searching :)
2007-06-18T12:52:00.000Z	dromer	bsdunix	but I don't really want xinerama (two separate x-servers right?)
2007-06-18T12:53:00.000Z	dromer	bsdunix	I'm going te try twinview (spread one x-server over two screens) , I got it working on my other pc with a tv-attached, but it's a total different config since it uses composite and stuff
