2007-05-08T08:58:00.000Z	AhmedTheGreat		Can I uninstall something.. or change the settings, through the alt+ctrl+f5 screen?
2007-05-08T08:59:00.000Z	dabaR	AhmedTheGreat	you can do anything you know how. installation in the command line is done with aptitude or apt-get
2007-05-08T09:01:00.000Z	dabaR	AhmedTheGreat	do you know what the name of the package is that installed nvidia vga?
2007-05-08T09:02:00.000Z	dabaR	AhmedTheGreat	can you find out?
2007-05-08T09:03:00.000Z	dabaR	AhmedTheGreat	this may be the way: run "aptitude search nvidia" in that console window(alt-ctrl-f5), see what results come up with i on the beginning of the lien
2007-05-08T09:04:00.000Z	AhmedTheGreat	dabaR	I really know nothing about linux.. could you tell me things step by step?
2007-05-08T09:06:00.000Z	dabaR	AhmedTheGreat	1.hold down alt and ctrl, and press f5. 2. log in with your user name and password. 3. type "aptitude search nvidia", press enter. 4. write down the names of the packages that have the letter "i" on the beginning of their lines. 5. come back here and tell me the names.
2007-05-08T09:28:00.000Z	dabaR	AhmedTheGreat	I was in the kitchen. I dont know. To install it again, run sudo aptitude install nvidia-glx
2007-05-08T09:13:00.000Z	dabaR	AhmedTheGreat	prepend messages to me with my nick, I missed that one. again in the place you got those names, type sudo aptitude remove nvidia-glx, press enter, and follow the prompts. It should be uninstalled after that.
2007-05-08T09:14:00.000Z	AhmedTheGreat	dabaR	Nvidia-glx, and  nvidia-kernel-common
2007-05-08T09:15:00.000Z	dabaR	AhmedTheGreat	in the place you got  those names, type sudo aptitude remove nvidia-glx, press enter, and follow the prompts. It should  be uninstalled after that.
2007-05-08T09:20:00.000Z	AhmedTheGreat	dabaR	now, I don't have an interface anymore, how can I fix that? >.>
2007-05-08T09:20:00.000Z	dabaR	AhmedTheGreat	what interface? you mean the graphical user interface?
2007-05-08T09:22:00.000Z	dabaR	AhmedTheGreat	well, I am not sure. Try typing "sudo invoke-rc.d gdm restart" in that same place, and then press enter. I am going to use run "" instead of type "" and press enter from now on in our conversation.
2007-05-08T09:23:00.000Z	AhmedTheGreat	dabaR	I may need to install the nvidia thing again.
2007-05-08T09:24:00.000Z	AhmedTheGreat	dabaR	because it gave me a message saying "Failed to start the X server (your graphical interface)." and stuff..
2007-05-08T09:26:00.000Z	AhmedTheGreat	dabaR	um?
2007-05-08T09:32:00.000Z	AhmedTheGreat	dabaR	for some reason, my laptop seems to be unable to view the interface, as soon as I get to the login screen, I get a black screen instead.
2007-05-08T09:35:00.000Z	dabaR	AhmedTheGreat	I am not sure
