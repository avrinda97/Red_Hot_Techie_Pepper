2012-10-31T07:24:00.000Z	almoxarife	chadams	have you tried deleting the 'lock' file mentioned?
2012-10-31T07:25:00.000Z	almoxarife	chadams	have you rebooted since seeing the Read/only error?
2012-10-31T07:26:00.000Z	chadams	almoxarife	blackshirt: KBentley57 has been helping me
2012-10-31T07:27:00.000Z	almoxarife	chadams	i didn't ask who was helping you, i asked if you had rebooted since the RO error, it's a yes or no question!
2012-10-31T07:27:00.000Z	chadams	almoxarife	no
2012-10-31T07:37:00.000Z	almoxarife	chadams	lets assume you don't have a crippled system, what is the aversion to a reboot? is it a server doing the queens works?
2012-10-31T07:44:00.000Z	almoxarife	chadams	time to look at the prob being a crippled ext4 file sys
2012-10-31T07:45:00.000Z	almoxarife	chadams	yes, re-install
2012-10-31T07:48:00.000Z	almoxarife	chadams	a wubi install does all the disk creating, if you are wanting to do actual disk creation then get 'gparted' free up disk space and do an actual install, yes you will lose MBR, so what, you got grub
