2011-01-29T20:38:00.000Z	snimavat		kernal update released today?
2011-01-29T20:39:00.000Z	snimavat		Why apt-get upgrade doesnt pick it?
2011-01-29T20:39:00.000Z	snimavat		Whats the different between apt-get upgrade and update manger?
2011-01-29T20:40:00.000Z	snimavat		update manager = apt-get update and apt-get dist-upgrade, ??
2011-01-29T20:40:00.000Z	snimavat		no errors in sources.list, i never touched it
2011-01-29T20:41:00.000Z	jrib	snimavat	no?
2011-01-29T20:51:00.000Z	jrib	snimavat	because you aren't running « sudo apt-get dist-upgrade »
2011-01-29T20:52:00.000Z	jrib	snimavat	you can read about the differences in « man apt-get ».  To search a man page for "dist-upgrade" for example, enter the man page and type: /dist-upgrade<enter>.  The 'n' and 'N' keys will scroll through hits
2011-02-01T18:48:00.000Z	jrib	snimavat	did you find a bug report at bugs.ubuntu.com?
2011-02-01T18:51:00.000Z	snimavat	jrib	any idea?
2011-02-01T18:51:00.000Z	jrib	snimavat	I suggested you find a bug report
2011-02-01T18:52:00.000Z	snimavat	jrib	no such bug report found
2011-02-01T18:56:00.000Z	jrib	snimavat	this? https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gtk+2.0/+bug/681567
2011-02-01T19:01:00.000Z	jrib	snimavat	I would follow that bug report
2011-02-01T19:03:00.000Z	snimavat	jrib	thnx
2011-02-01T19:03:00.000Z	jrib	snimavat	personally, I'd rule out hardware issues
2011-02-01T19:03:00.000Z	snimavat	jrib	rule out?
2011-02-01T19:04:00.000Z	jrib	snimavat	yeah, see if it happens with a different mouse.  Or see if that mouse displays the behavior on a different OS
2011-02-01T19:04:00.000Z	snimavat	jrib	nope, the mouse works fine with my win xp, its just ubuntu which has issues
