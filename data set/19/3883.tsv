2011-04-16T22:41:00.000Z	vsingh165		hello
2011-04-16T22:43:00.000Z	vsingh165		Anyone here know why the Linksys WMP54G (rev 4.1) won't connect at all under 10.10 64-bit?
2011-04-16T22:43:00.000Z	vsingh165		been googling a lot about this card, and it seems to have junk drivers despite costing $60
2011-04-16T22:44:00.000Z	erUSUL	vsingh165	what chipset does the card uses?
2011-04-16T22:44:00.000Z	vsingh165	erUSUL	ralink rt61
2011-04-16T22:44:00.000Z	vsingh165	erUSUL	it's got the right module loaded (rt61pci)
2011-04-16T22:45:00.000Z	erUSUL	vsingh165	dunno; i have aralink ( 2500pci ) that works ok. try with newer drivers « sudo apt-get install linux-backports-modules-wireless-$(lsb_release -cs)-generic »
2011-04-16T22:45:00.000Z	erUSUL	vsingh165	a reboot is neccesary
2011-04-16T22:45:00.000Z	vsingh165	erUSUL	I've rebooted many many times, still can't get it to behave
2011-04-16T22:45:00.000Z	vsingh165	erUSUL	funny thing is, my Macbook connects just fine to the exact same access point
2011-04-16T22:45:00.000Z	erUSUL	vsingh165	the reboot is to use the new driver after installing it
2011-04-16T22:46:00.000Z	vsingh165	erUSUL	so I know it can't be the network
2011-04-16T22:49:00.000Z	vsingh165	erUSUL	lemme reboot this machine and try ndiswrapper instead of the rt61 driver
2011-04-16T22:49:00.000Z	erUSUL	vsingh165	dunno why are you telling me you are ignoring my advice....
2011-04-16T22:50:00.000Z	vsingh165	erUSUL	like I've said, rebooting isn't the ix
2011-04-16T22:50:00.000Z	vsingh165	erUSUL	the module is loaded, and the card is seeing nearby networks
2011-04-16T22:50:00.000Z	vsingh165	erUSUL	but the stupid thing fails to get an IP, and I have it set to automatic DHCP
2011-04-16T22:50:00.000Z	erUSUL	vsingh165	you did not read what i said twice *install* *newer* *drivers* « sudo apt-get install linux-backports-modules-wireless-$(lsb_release -cs)-generic »
2011-04-16T23:04:00.000Z	erUSUL	vsingh165	sudo iwlist wlan0 scan
