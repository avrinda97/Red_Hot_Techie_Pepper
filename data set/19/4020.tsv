2010-08-12T04:44:00.000Z	agoole	mek||malloc	ok, thanks
2010-08-12T04:44:00.000Z	mek||malloc	agoole	Boot using a live disk and mount your problematic drive.
2010-08-12T04:52:00.000Z	agoole	mek||malloc	ok, loaded live cd.
2010-08-12T04:52:00.000Z	agoole	mek||malloc	looking to mount the drive.
2010-08-12T04:52:00.000Z	agoole	mek||malloc	any ideas on how I can fix this boot ?
2010-08-12T04:56:00.000Z	mek||malloc	agoole	If you are still trying to mount the drive: fdisk -l should list available devices.
2010-08-12T04:56:00.000Z	agoole	mek||malloc	ok, done and mounted, but i'm blind on how to fix the boot issue...any clue ?
2010-08-12T04:56:00.000Z	mek||malloc	agoole	http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Keyboard-and-Console-HOWTO-7.html Did you take a look at that?
2010-08-12T04:57:00.000Z	agoole	mek||malloc	yup, didn't help
2010-08-12T04:57:00.000Z	mek||malloc	agoole	Gotcha. So what symptoms exactly are you encountering. Does the machine boot from the HDD?
2010-08-12T04:58:00.000Z	agoole	mek||malloc	boots, but then screen goes black
2010-08-12T04:58:00.000Z	agoole	mek||malloc	even in recovery.
2010-08-12T04:59:00.000Z	mek||malloc	agoole	It could be a number of things.... Is there any opportunity for you to Ctrl Alt 1 after core modules are loaded but before the screen goes black?
2010-08-12T04:59:00.000Z	agoole	mek||malloc	hum....the last thing it says is loading selection 1 of 1, and then black.
2010-08-12T05:00:00.000Z	agoole	mek||malloc	let me try that right now.
2010-08-12T05:00:00.000Z	agoole	mek||malloc	because I can see all the modules load, and then its almost like the screen shuts off
