2007-03-31T07:36:00.000Z	penguin5201		anyone mind helping me with some wireless card issues?
2007-03-31T07:36:00.000Z	spasticteapot	penguin5201	What's the problem?
2007-03-31T07:37:00.000Z	penguin5201	spasticteapot	ubuntu recognizes the wireless card, but even after i config it with the right ESSID, it still doesnt work, so then i tried to insall a driver for it, but now it doesnt show at all.
2007-03-31T07:38:00.000Z	spasticteapot	penguin5201	Run iwconfing in terminal.
2007-03-31T07:39:00.000Z	spasticteapot	penguin5201	LSpci?
2007-03-31T07:40:00.000Z	spasticteapot	penguin5201	LSPCI will tell you the PCI cards.
2007-03-31T07:41:00.000Z	penguin5201	spasticteapot	i dont understand what you are trying to tell me.
2007-03-31T07:42:00.000Z	spasticteapot	penguin5201	Well, it might be that your card is cooked.
2007-03-31T07:42:00.000Z	penguin5201	spasticteapot	it works fine in windows.
2007-03-31T07:43:00.000Z	spasticteapot	penguin5201	Well, Linux might not be detecting it.
2007-03-31T07:43:00.000Z	penguin5201	spasticteapot	remember, i'm halfway through an installation, and it dissapeared after i ran a script.
2007-03-31T07:43:00.000Z	spasticteapot	penguin5201	Oy vey.
2007-03-31T07:44:00.000Z	penguin5201	spasticteapot	its a fresh install of ubuntu, im just gonna reformat, ill get back to you in a sec.
2007-03-31T07:46:00.000Z	penguin5201	spasticteapot	would iwconfig work on a live cd bootup?
2007-03-31T07:47:00.000Z	spasticteapot	penguin5201	Dunno.
2007-03-31T07:47:00.000Z	spasticteapot	penguin5201	LSPCI should.
2007-03-31T07:47:00.000Z	penguin5201	spasticteapot	what is LSPCI?
2007-03-31T07:47:00.000Z	spasticteapot	penguin5201	lspci is the command for making the PC tell you what your PCI cards are.
2007-03-31T07:48:00.000Z	penguin5201	spasticteapot	i tried it in console before, but it didnt work.
