2010-10-15T02:08:00.000Z	kv102t		Also if i download and use CD to upgrade, it will do so, Correct?
2010-10-15T02:10:00.000Z	acicula	kv102t	MrClean you can update from cd/dvd with the alternate installation disc.
2010-10-15T02:10:00.000Z	acicula	kv102t	id use an online update if possible though
2010-10-15T02:12:00.000Z	kv102t	acicula	it's not showing on my update manager
2010-10-15T02:13:00.000Z	acicula	kv102t	go into system->administration->software sources and look for an option that governs wether you get informed of every 6 month ubuntu upgrade or just the 18month lts update.
2010-10-15T02:14:00.000Z	acicula	kv102t	then rerun update-manager, check sources and it should provide you the upgrade option at the top of the update-manager window
2010-10-15T02:16:00.000Z	kv102t	acicula	it's says "long term support"
2010-10-15T02:19:00.000Z	kv102t	acicula	OK i got it. Should i update?
2010-10-15T02:19:00.000Z	acicula	kv102t	that depends
2010-10-15T02:20:00.000Z	kv102t	acicula	well eveything works. is there anything new and sweet about the 10.10...  ? lol
2010-10-15T02:20:00.000Z	acicula	kv102t	idunno, im using 10.10, its not completely terrible, theres an maverick experience topic on the ubuntu forum that may be usefull?
2010-10-15T02:21:00.000Z	kv102t	acicula	could anything go wrong, now i know yer,yer it could but how lickley is it. Got vbox what i don't want to kill
2010-10-15T02:22:00.000Z	kv102t	acicula	might just download as CD and try as liveCD first.
2010-10-15T02:22:00.000Z	acicula	kv102t	if ose it'll get updated automatically, if its the closed source version you'll have to make sure the new kernel gets the driver i think. As always backup before upgrading
2010-10-15T02:23:00.000Z	acicula	kv102t	it works fine for me bar a few small glitches with hardware thats poorly supported(still).
2010-10-15T02:24:00.000Z	kv102t	acicula	Thanks, Think i'll clode MY HDD before updating !
