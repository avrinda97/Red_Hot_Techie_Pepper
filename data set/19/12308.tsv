2007-03-03T10:52:00.000Z	poe-t		is there a ubuntu 6.10 live DVD available for download?
2007-03-03T10:52:00.000Z	eobanb	poe-t	indeed there is
2007-03-03T10:53:00.000Z	poe-t	eobanb	could please direct me to it or the torrent of it (preferrably) or ftp?
2007-03-03T10:53:00.000Z	poe-t	eobanb	does it allow to show off beryl to windows guys?
2007-03-03T10:53:00.000Z	eobanb	poe-t	http://www.ubuntu.com/products/GetUbuntu/download?action=show&redirect=download
2007-03-03T10:53:00.000Z	eobanb	poe-t	scroll all the way down to the bottom
2007-03-03T10:53:00.000Z	poe-t	eobanb	thank you!
2007-03-03T10:53:00.000Z	eobanb	poe-t	the liveCD? no
2007-03-03T10:54:00.000Z	eobanb	poe-t	once ubuntu is installed, you can install beryl
2007-03-03T10:59:00.000Z	poe-t	eobanb	I can use it as a live dvd and installation dvd right?
2007-03-03T10:59:00.000Z	eobanb	poe-t	yes, it is the same thing.
2007-03-03T11:00:00.000Z	poe-t	eobanb	thank you. I'm going to try to convert some people w/it ;-)
2007-03-03T11:00:00.000Z	eobanb	poe-t	good luck to you with that :)
2007-03-03T11:01:00.000Z	eobanb	poe-t	i'd advise installing it before demoing though, for speed purposes mainly
2007-03-03T11:02:00.000Z	poe-t	eobanb	well.. yeah that would be best but I'll have to demo it first ;-) speed comparable to knoppix?
2007-03-03T11:03:00.000Z	eobanb	poe-t	well i'm just saying that any liveCD tends to be much slower than the desktop equivalent.
2007-03-03T11:03:00.000Z	eobanb	poe-t	especially to boot up
2007-03-03T11:03:00.000Z	poe-t	eobanb	of course
