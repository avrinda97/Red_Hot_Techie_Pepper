2005-12-25T14:57:00.000Z	SweetestSavage		Excuse me, can anyone tell me how I can possibly change my accounts privileges? Sometimes I like to open up text files to edit them in GEdit, but unfortunately I can't because I don't have enough permission. I'm just wondering so I don't have to do it through the terminal all the time.
2005-12-25T14:57:00.000Z	korhalf	SweetestSavage	as root you can change the mode of the file
2005-12-25T14:57:00.000Z	SweetestSavage	korhalf	I know.. but.. I mean in the GUI
2005-12-25T14:57:00.000Z	korhalf	SweetestSavage	ie. sudo chmod 655 foo.txt
2005-12-25T14:58:00.000Z	korhalf	SweetestSavage	uh, i dont use gui, a whole lot
2005-12-25T14:58:00.000Z	korhalf	SweetestSavage	right click on the file, and go to properties
2005-12-25T14:58:00.000Z	korhalf	SweetestSavage	if you want to use linux efficiently, learn the terminal, thats what 80 percent of linux is about
2005-12-25T14:58:00.000Z	korhalf	SweetestSavage	the windows in you wants the GUI, you gotta just forget it
2005-12-25T14:59:00.000Z	korhalf	SweetestSavage	probably not, but you can accidently delete important things and not even know it
2005-12-25T14:59:00.000Z	korhalf	SweetestSavage	good
2005-12-25T15:00:00.000Z	korhalf	SweetestSavage	thats the best way to learn :) just open up the shell and mess around, move files around, pipe stuff to Grep, learn to use it efficiently
2005-12-25T15:00:00.000Z	korhalf	SweetestSavage	save the mouse some wear and tear, plus it's faster thru the terminal with tab completion, at least to me
2005-12-25T15:23:00.000Z	korhalf	SweetestSavage	gftp
2005-12-25T15:23:00.000Z	korhalf	SweetestSavage	just an ftp frontend.
2005-12-25T15:24:00.000Z	SweetestSavage	korhalf	how do you mean?
2005-12-25T15:24:00.000Z	korhalf	SweetestSavage	by default, you should have an ftp program at the terminal
2005-12-25T15:24:00.000Z	korhalf	SweetestSavage	just type ftp host
2005-12-25T15:24:00.000Z	korhalf	SweetestSavage	where host is the host you're ftping too, of course, its all at the terminal and gets annoying, so just use GFTP
2005-12-25T15:25:00.000Z	korhalf	SweetestSavage	in this case gftp > ftp in my opinion, just faster for me at least
