2009-01-15T03:58:00.000Z	deltah	richy_	wouldnt that delete the information saved in my /home on ubuntu?
2009-01-15T03:58:00.000Z	richy_	deltah	u can if u lik jus i install a new wubi ... and find the root.disk in that found.000 folder and replace the newly root.disk
2009-01-15T03:59:00.000Z	deltah	richy_	ah, so the old one will be in found.000?  u sure about that?
2009-01-15T03:59:00.000Z	richy_		deltah:if it crashed into grub4dos then the root.disk will be in a found.000 on ya harddrive
