2008-08-05T18:56:00.000Z	nibsa1242b		What is the command to stop and start/ restart Pulse Audio? I had an application crash and now I have no sound.
2008-08-05T18:58:00.000Z	debian_akroyd	nibsa1242b	try sudo pulseaudio -k
2008-08-05T18:58:00.000Z	debian_akroyd	nibsa1242b	then try reloading the pulseaudio daemon
2008-08-05T18:58:00.000Z	nibsa1242b	debian_akroyd	I got a "E: main.c: Failed to kill daemon." (and Failed to kill printed in red)
2008-08-05T18:59:00.000Z	debian_akroyd	nibsa1242b	sudo pulseaudio -k
2008-08-05T18:59:00.000Z	nibsa1242b	debian_akroyd	still failed to kill
2008-08-05T19:00:00.000Z	debian_akroyd	nibsa1242b	can you reboot and it still gives you the same issue?
2008-08-05T19:01:00.000Z	nibsa1242b	debian_akroyd	I think it'd be fine on reboot; but I'm in the middle of some moderately complicated web CSS development right now, and I'd prefer not to reboot.
2008-08-05T19:02:00.000Z	debian_akroyd	nibsa1242b	ah ic
2008-08-05T19:03:00.000Z	debian_akroyd	nibsa1242b	try to kill pulseaudio through your process viewer then reload it by running the pulseaudio comand
2008-08-05T19:04:00.000Z	nibsa1242b	debian_akroyd	its not in my process viewer (but I do have the applet open... I'll close that)
2008-08-05T19:05:00.000Z	debian_akroyd	nibsa1242b	well then if you cant find it, try just running pulseaudio
2008-08-05T19:05:00.000Z	debian_akroyd	nibsa1242b	that way it reloads the daemon
2008-08-05T19:05:00.000Z	nibsa1242b	debian_akroyd	did that... its working now
2008-08-05T19:05:00.000Z	debian_akroyd	nibsa1242b	cool
2008-08-05T19:06:00.000Z	nibsa1242b	debian_akroyd	thanks :) what ever happen must have crashed pulse as well as vlc
2008-08-05T19:06:00.000Z	debian_akroyd	nibsa1242b	could be that the pulseaudio daemon glitched and resulted in a crash which took out vlc
2008-08-05T19:07:00.000Z	nibsa1242b	debian_akroyd	true, it could have happened that way as well. Anyhow thanks for your help. I'm going to back to working on this website then.
