2011-02-27T20:22:00.000Z	stefg	vskram21	i don't know about sony supprt practices.my usual thinkpads got their bios updates by downloadable .iso-images which i burn to cd and boot from there
2011-02-27T20:23:00.000Z	vskram21	stefg	thank u
2011-02-27T20:25:00.000Z	stefg	vskram21	as a quick run down: check that youhave latest bios,then check that the hd is ok, and properly connected. After all the lowlevel stuff is sorted out then do a pastebin of 'dmesg' and come back

2011-02-27T20:29:00.000Z	stefg	vskram21	i'll have a look
2011-02-27T20:29:00.000Z	vskram21	stefg	 there is a bios update available but it's in exe format will that work over wine.?
2011-02-27T20:29:00.000Z	stefg	vskram21	no... the exe is probably a self extracting archive
2011-02-27T20:37:00.000Z	stefg	vskram21	your rootfilesystem is/was damaged  .... so ubuntu tried to repair it, which took a while
2011-02-27T20:48:00.000Z	vskram21	stefg	this is happening every time i boot my machine...
2011-02-27T20:49:00.000Z	vskram21	stefg	how would bios update fix this.?
2011-02-27T20:50:00.000Z	stefg	vskram21	looks like hardware trouble.... bad ram or hd at the edge of its lifespan ... i'd install smartmontools and check, and let a memtest run overnight
2011-02-27T20:59:00.000Z	vskram21	stefg	only the booting is very slow and once i get my gnome up every thing is o.k.. i am able to share file at the rate of 40Mbps.
2011-02-27T21:01:00.000Z	stefg	vskram21	nevertheless your root ext4 filesystem is corrupted and needed/needs repair at every boot... you should think over that. I had trouble with ext4, too.  As i found out out it was a bad stick of ram
