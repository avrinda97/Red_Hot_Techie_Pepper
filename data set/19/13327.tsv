2005-06-13T05:06:00.000Z	Madeye		guys How to grep 2 data in same command line ?
2005-06-13T05:06:00.000Z	Madeye		I have tried "whois yahoo.com | grep Expiration | grep NameServers
2005-06-13T05:06:00.000Z	Madeye		but didnt work
2005-06-13T05:07:00.000Z	Madeye		and whats the correct
2005-06-13T05:07:00.000Z	Madeye		lol
2005-06-13T05:07:00.000Z	ptlo	Madeye	you want to grep for either 'Expiration' or 'NameServers' words, right?
2005-06-13T05:07:00.000Z	Madeye	ptlo	 both
2005-06-13T05:08:00.000Z	ptlo	Madeye	then your line is correct
2005-06-13T05:08:00.000Z	Madeye	ptlo	 and whast the correct?
2005-06-13T05:09:00.000Z	Madeye	ptlo	 not working, when I use same syntax with only one grep it works
2005-06-13T05:11:00.000Z	Madeye	ptlo	 jad@madi:~/ssh $  whois yahoo.com | grep 'Expiration\|NameServers'
2005-06-13T05:11:00.000Z	ptlo	Madeye	yup, that's it, there's no 'NameServers' string in that output at all, anyways
2005-06-13T05:13:00.000Z	Madeye	ptlo	 how to grep such output Name Servers:
2005-06-13T05:13:00.000Z	ptlo	Madeye	grep 'Name Servers' ...
2005-06-13T05:15:00.000Z	ptlo	Madeye	grep uses a 'regular expression' to specify the search criteria. they're very powerful (you can combina and/or search, wildcards etc...), and you can find a regex tutorial at http://www.regular-expressions.info/tutorial.html
2006-02-19T17:54:00.000Z	ptlo	Madeye	mono
2006-02-19T17:55:00.000Z	Madeye	ptlo	 already have mono
2006-02-19T17:56:00.000Z	ptlo	Madeye	maybe the configure can't find it? what does configure.log say? is the compiler 'try: mcs' in your path?
