2010-05-01T00:53:00.000Z	mmvx		bryn_ click the clock, click the + near locations, click add
2010-05-01T00:53:00.000Z	bryn__	mmvx	i have already added my location
2010-05-01T00:53:00.000Z	bryn__	mmvx	and it was working in the beta and rc
2010-05-01T00:54:00.000Z	mmvx		bryn_ if you right click on the clock and choose preferences -> general are the settings all correct?
2010-05-01T00:54:00.000Z	bryn__	mmvx	ya, show date, show weather and show temperature
2010-05-01T00:55:00.000Z	mmvx		bryn_ only other thing is that if you didn't have an internet connection at boot it might not yet have refreshed?
2010-05-01T00:55:00.000Z	mmvx		bryn_ try choosing a different location?
2010-05-01T00:55:00.000Z	mmvx		bryn_ as a test
2010-05-01T00:56:00.000Z	bryn__	mmvx	ya the weather shows up under locations for both of them, but still not next to the clock
2010-05-01T00:56:00.000Z	mmvx		bryn_ have you changed your icon theme?
2010-05-01T00:57:00.000Z	bryn__	mmvx	no, still at default
2010-05-01T00:58:00.000Z	bryn__	mmvx	weird thing is if i uncheck either weather or temperature, the icons to the left of the clock move over slightly
2010-05-01T00:58:00.000Z	mmvx		bryn_ ah ok. Maybe try unlocking the notification area and moving it slightly
2010-05-01T00:59:00.000Z	bryn__	mmvx	moved it to the middle of the top panel, no
2010-05-01T01:00:00.000Z	mmvx	bryn__	what about moving the clock instead?
2010-05-01T01:01:00.000Z	bryn__	mmvx	it was the clock i moved to the middle
2010-05-01T01:03:00.000Z	mmvx	bryn__	it's like it can't find the icons it needs, if you say you can see the weather in the location dropdown
2010-05-01T01:03:00.000Z	bryn__	mmvx	i feel like an idiot... i didn't hit the set button next to the location i added. i don't remember having to do that in 9.10 but anyway it's working. thanks for you time!
2010-05-01T01:04:00.000Z	mmvx	bryn__	no worries!
