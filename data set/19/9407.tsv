2006-11-20T14:18:00.000Z	jmspeex		Can anyone help me get Edgy64 working (i.e. not crashing) on my "Core 2 Duo" laptop. At the moment, any ACPI event (lid close, ac, ...) causes a crash with no error message.
2006-11-20T14:19:00.000Z	jmspeex		If I disable acpi (or use acpi=noirq), it no longer crash, but it's not very useful, since I can't use the second core.
2006-11-20T07:31:00.000Z	jmspeex		Anyone's had problems with the screen not turning back on when closing the lid.
2006-11-20T07:31:00.000Z	jmspeex		?
2006-11-20T07:32:00.000Z	umops	jmspeex	Do you mean when opening the lid (of a laptop)
2006-11-20T07:34:00.000Z	umops	jmspeex	what happens when you press a key or power button?
2006-11-20T07:34:00.000Z	jmspeex	umops	The machine is normal otherwise. I can do a blind Ctrl-Alt-F1 and type init 6 and it reboots
2006-11-20T07:37:00.000Z	umops	jmspeex	have to had a look around in System-> Power Management?
2006-11-20T07:38:00.000Z	jmspeex	umops	Even if I tell it not to do anything on lid close, the screen still goes blank. Actually, closing the lid in single-user mode does the same.
2006-11-20T07:40:00.000Z	umops	jmspeex	that's odd.  Maybe some issue with a driver, or even you laptop has a hardware deafults to turn screen off when it is closed.
2006-11-20T07:42:00.000Z	jmspeex	umops	when I close the lid in grub, it goes blank and turns back on when I open it. It's only once Linux has booted that it doesn't do that anymore.
2006-11-20T07:43:00.000Z	jmspeex	umops	do you know what happens exactly (sequence of events) when one closes the lid on a laptop?
2006-11-20T07:45:00.000Z	umops	jmspeex	I don't know sorry.  You could have a look at /etc/acpi/lid.sh and related files.
2006-11-20T07:46:00.000Z	umops	jmspeex	does it make a difference if you are running on battery or not?
2006-11-20T07:47:00.000Z	jmspeex	umops	no
2006-11-20T07:50:00.000Z	jmspeex	umops	BTW vbetool dpms seems to work fine
2006-11-20T07:50:00.000Z	umops	jmspeex	I don't think i can help you with it then.  Maybe try in #gnome?
2006-11-20T07:51:00.000Z	jmspeex	umops	It's not a gnome problem. It happens even in the console, in single-user mode
2006-11-20T08:09:00.000Z	jmspeex	umops	Any idea why X would crash when I do a lid close/open? If I do it while in a console, it works.
