2005-09-19T05:09:00.000Z	freedomjazzdance	abbot45	 what are you trying to do?
2005-09-19T05:09:00.000Z	abbot45	freedomjazzdance	set up my router that i just got.
2005-09-19T05:09:00.000Z	freedomjazzdance	abbot45	 setting up a wireless router right>
2005-09-19T05:09:00.000Z	abbot45	freedomjazzdance	yup
2005-09-19T05:10:00.000Z	freedomjazzdance	abbot45	do you need to set it up on a windows computer first?
2005-09-19T05:10:00.000Z	freedomjazzdance	abbot45	what kind of router is it?
2005-09-19T05:10:00.000Z	abbot45	freedomjazzdance	but the wifi light is not flashing on the router, so i'm wondering if im still grabbing someone elses connection in a different apt.
2005-09-19T05:11:00.000Z	freedomjazzdance	abbot45	ok well type iwconfig to see what network you are connected to
2005-09-19T05:13:00.000Z	freedomjazzdance	abbot45	try system>admin>networking
2005-09-19T05:14:00.000Z	abbot45	freedomjazzdance	im in that, but it doesnt like list the available connections.
2005-09-19T05:16:00.000Z	freedomjazzdance	abbot45	in properties of the wireless device there should be a pulldown menu for essid
2005-09-19T05:16:00.000Z	abbot45	freedomjazzdance	it just says "any" and doesnt give any other options.
2005-09-19T05:18:00.000Z	freedomjazzdance	abbot45	try iwlist scan
2005-09-19T05:19:00.000Z	abbot45	freedomjazzdance	"eth0      Failed to read scan data : Operation not supported"
2005-09-19T05:19:00.000Z	freedomjazzdance	abbot45	 is eth0 your wireless?
2005-09-19T05:19:00.000Z	abbot45	freedomjazzdance	i believe so.
2005-09-19T05:20:00.000Z	freedomjazzdance	abbot45	when you do iwconfig is this the device it shows?
2005-09-19T05:20:00.000Z	abbot45	freedomjazzdance	yes.  its using eth0 to connect to my neighbor.
