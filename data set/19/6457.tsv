2012-07-30T11:04:00.000Z	qwebirc85124		what is the advantage of ubuntu vs windows
2012-07-30T11:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	qwebirc85124	choice, cost, apps
2012-07-30T11:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	qwebirc85124	system footprint
2012-07-30T11:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	qwebirc85124	Ubuntu installed (including CD burning, all the codecs you can want and all the apps you'll need is about 5Gb tops, needing 1Gb RAM. Windows 7 s about 7Gb just for itself, then load in Office and so forth and it gets fat real fast, it also uses truckloads of RAM
2012-07-30T11:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	qwebirc85124	it is easy, its not hard at all, its just different to what you are familiar with
2012-07-30T11:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	qwebirc85124	you can do most things in GUI, but IRC is a text based thing so its a good idea to give text based fixes etc
2012-07-30T11:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	qwebirc85124	there are guides online for most things, as you use the OS  you will learn, just as you learned windows
2012-07-30T11:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	qwebirc85124	what printer?
2012-07-30T11:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	qwebirc85124	what scan apps have you tried?
2012-07-30T11:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	qwebirc85124	ahh you mean press the button on the printer and it scans?
2012-07-30T11:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	qwebirc85124	if you run:  xev   the press the button, does it make an event?
2012-07-30T11:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	qwebirc85124	yes, its a terminal command
2012-07-30T11:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	qwebirc85124	yes, but when you press keys, xev reacts
2012-07-30T11:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	qwebirc85124	so when you press the scan button, does it make similar events
2012-07-30T11:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	qwebirc85124	ok so now you can tell the OS to do stuff when it gets those signals, you may need to scan in command line but you won't notice
2012-07-30T11:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	qwebirc85124	its the same principle
2012-07-30T11:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	qwebirc85124	http://askubuntu.com/questions/71962/canoscan-lide-110-driver-for-ubuntu-how-to-scan-via-command-line    has a command to scan in cLI, have the OS react to the press by running the command
2012-07-30T11:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	qwebirc85124	yes but the input from the printer needs to fire that command and then the button will trigger a scan, as you expect
2012-07-30T11:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	qwebirc85124	ive never had to configure keys, the link ubottu gave will show you most of it
