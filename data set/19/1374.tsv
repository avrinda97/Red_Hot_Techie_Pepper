2012-10-13T00:58:00.000Z	ChrisWere		so guys is that what the leading piece of advice is? reinstall my distro?
2012-10-13T00:58:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	ChrisWere	 im not clear on what the original problem is/was/ ;)
2012-10-13T00:59:00.000Z	ChrisWere	Dr_willis_	cricky! if I'm not being told to be patient, I'm being told to repeat the problem YET AGAIN! I can't get the resolution 1280x960 to appear in my Nvidia-Config and it was there this morning
2012-10-13T01:00:00.000Z	Dr_willis_		so theres higher res's avail? or you have lost the highest it could do?
2012-10-13T01:00:00.000Z	ChrisWere		Dr_willis_:I've lost the highest I could do, it's just dissapeared
2012-10-13T01:01:00.000Z	ChrisWere		crazydip:what?!
2012-10-13T01:01:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	ChrisWere	 but all the other res's are still there?   this a hdmi or vga monitor? or built in laptop?
2012-10-13T01:01:00.000Z	Dr_willis_		what is the hightest res it will let you do?
2012-10-13T01:01:00.000Z	ChrisWere		crazy: it's a vga, I used to have to have a 2nd which was a vga going to a HDMI through a converter
2012-10-13T01:02:00.000Z	ChrisWere	Dr_willis_	:the resolutions go up to 1152x864
2012-10-13T01:03:00.000Z	Dr_willis_		this is a LCD monitor? Some of the res's seem very... weird. ;)
2012-10-13T01:03:00.000Z	ChrisWere		Dr_willis_:No it's a regular one
2012-10-13T01:04:00.000Z	Dr_willis_		its an old fashioned VGA Tube type Moniotor that can do 1280x960?  Thats somthing id never seen befor.
2012-10-13T01:04:00.000Z	ChrisWere	Dr_willis_	does this mean your giving up on me?
2012-10-13T01:05:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	ChrisWere	 how i recall it working. X/drivers query the monitor and the monitor reports back wht modes it can handle. those hdmi/vga adaptors can confuse the process. but you said its just a straight vga connection correct?
2012-10-13T01:06:00.000Z	ChrisWere	Dr_willis_	yeah it's only when I try using the 2nd monitor where I need to use a converter
2012-10-13T01:07:00.000Z	Dr_willis_		well for starters id run the 'nvidia-settings' tool and make sure you are in fact using the nvidia driver, not some other driver.  I think the xrandr command can report what modes the monitor 'reports' back that it can use.  double check that the mode is being reported back.
2012-10-13T01:07:00.000Z	Dr_willis_		it might be possible to have xrandr force the mode.
2012-10-13T01:09:00.000Z	ChrisWere	Dr_willis_	what command would I use to get xrandr to force the mode?
