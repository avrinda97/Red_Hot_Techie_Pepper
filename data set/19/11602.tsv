2006-12-01T08:46:00.000Z	Skwid_		hum ... everything was working fine, and now my fat32 partition is mounted as a read only file system
2006-12-01T08:46:00.000Z	Skwid_		what could be the problem ?
2006-12-01T08:46:00.000Z	Skwid_		my /etc/fstab looks like it used to look
2006-12-01T08:47:00.000Z	Lukian	Skwid_	dmesg have any useful output for you?
2006-12-01T08:48:00.000Z	Skwid_	Lukian	indeed it appears to have !
2006-12-01T08:48:00.000Z	Skwid_	Lukian	i have a whole bunch of this:
2006-12-01T08:49:00.000Z	Skwid_	Lukian	hum, i have nothing on chkdsk
2006-12-01T08:50:00.000Z	Skwid_	Lukian	what else can i use to share with windows easily ?
2006-12-01T08:51:00.000Z	Lukian	Skwid_	hmm, I personally use my NTFS partitions intentionally in read-only.
2006-12-01T08:51:00.000Z	Skwid_	Lukian	yeah i need writing :(
2006-12-01T08:52:00.000Z	Skwid_	Lukian	what command should i use to check my disk ?
2006-12-01T08:52:00.000Z	Lukian	Skwid_	let me see if i can find something for that :)
2006-12-01T08:55:00.000Z	Lukian	Skwid_	 what nolimitsoya said, other than that, is upgrading to ntfs an option?
2006-12-01T08:56:00.000Z	Skwid_	Lukian	sure ... but i originally moved all my files from ntfs to fat32 so that i could share them :(
