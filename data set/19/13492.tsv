2005-03-24T06:41:00.000Z	Brunellus_		Ok.  one more time.  can anyone help me with my network printer?
2005-03-24T06:42:00.000Z	Brunellus_		nobody out there?
2005-03-24T06:42:00.000Z	bamm	Brunellus_	setup cups yet?
2005-03-24T06:43:00.000Z	Brunellus_	bamm	 I'm trying to get this (ubuntu) box to talk to a printer on a little print server thingie
2005-03-24T06:43:00.000Z	Brunellus_		(it attaches to the parallel port of the printer)
2005-03-24T06:43:00.000Z	Brunellus_		my windows box can see & print from that fine
2005-03-24T06:43:00.000Z	Brunellus_		for the windows box, it's an SMB printer
2005-03-24T06:43:00.000Z	Brunellus_		but I don't know how to make it run for this one
2005-03-24T06:44:00.000Z	bamm	Brunellus_	use samba to set it up on your local machine
2005-03-24T06:46:00.000Z	Brunellus_	bamm	 I've been trying
2005-03-24T06:46:00.000Z	Brunellus_		I don't know what I"m doing wrong
2005-03-24T06:47:00.000Z	bamm	Brunellus_	well what have you done so far
2005-03-24T06:47:00.000Z	Brunellus_	bamm	 tried to add it as a network printer...
2005-03-24T06:47:00.000Z	Brunellus_		I select "SMB"
2005-03-24T06:48:00.000Z	Brunellus_		for host, I put whatever I see on the "network" tab in nautilus
2005-03-24T06:48:00.000Z	Brunellus_		I set it to P1, since that's what worked on the other box
2005-03-24T06:48:00.000Z	Brunellus_		and I set it to print a test page
2005-03-24T06:48:00.000Z	Brunellus_		the test page never comes out.  it's showing a timeout
2005-03-24T06:50:00.000Z	bamm	Brunellus_	use lpr from the command line to print directly to it
