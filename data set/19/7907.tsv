2008-10-03T05:10:00.000Z	juro		hi, I am running Ubuntu 8.04 64 bit with 4Gb Ram installed. Now somehoe I only have 800mb free but there is no reason for this :(
2008-10-03T05:10:00.000Z	jrib	juro	type 'free -m' observe the +/- buffers line
2008-10-03T05:12:00.000Z	jrib	juro	did you run the command I said?
2008-10-03T05:17:00.000Z	juro	jrib	can you read the 'histo' in front of my posts?
2008-10-03T05:18:00.000Z	jrib	juro	I've asked you a question twice, so I was making sure you weren't addressing the channel with one of your responses
2008-10-03T05:19:00.000Z	juro	jrib	ok, yes - but I don't know what the outpur tells me
2008-10-03T05:19:00.000Z	jrib	juro	then pastebin it and show us
2008-10-03T05:20:00.000Z	juro	jrib	http://pastebin.com/d2bc50be2
2008-10-03T05:20:00.000Z	jrib	juro	you have over 2600mb free after taking into account buffers/cache
2008-10-03T05:21:00.000Z	jrib	juro	linux tries to be smart about using your memory.  If it can use it it will.  The idea being that it is doing you no good if you aren't using it.  If another app needs the memory, it will free it up
2008-10-03T05:22:00.000Z	juro	jrib	ok - that makes sense. so how do I uninstall the system monitor?
2008-10-03T05:22:00.000Z	jrib	juro	erm, why?
2008-10-03T05:23:00.000Z	juro	jrib	forget it - it was a joke
2008-10-03T05:23:00.000Z	jrib	juro	heh :)
2008-10-03T05:24:00.000Z	juro	jrib	I am really missing my Directory Opus though .... nautilus is like Duplo ...
2008-10-03T05:25:00.000Z	jrib	juro	which features do you miss?  (never used it)
2008-10-03T05:25:00.000Z	juro	jrib	just the complete feel of it. dual windows with tabs, etc etc etc
2008-10-03T05:26:00.000Z	jrib	juro	try gnome-commander maybe.  nautilus is getting tabs next release though
2008-10-03T05:28:00.000Z	juro	jrib	I am still trying to get used to Ubuntu (have used various Linux servers over the years) - not really that refined though
