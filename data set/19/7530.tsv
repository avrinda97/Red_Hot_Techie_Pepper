2008-01-15T21:16:00.000Z	Pici	dgjones	Open a nautilus window and modify your 'bookmarks', those should show up in the places menu.
2008-01-15T21:16:00.000Z	dgjones	Pici	thanks, I'll give that a go
2008-01-15T21:23:00.000Z	dgjones	Pici	I don't seem to be able to add a bookmark, I can edit current ones but clicking the "+ Add Bookmark" or pressing Control D doesn't do anything, woudl i need to run sudo nautilus?
2008-01-15T21:23:00.000Z	Pici	dgjones	let me take a look at mine, hold on.
2008-01-15T21:26:00.000Z	Pici	dgjones	You need to be in the folder that you want to add to the bookmarks before you can actually add them.  The + Add Bookmark button doesnt open up a window to add a new bookmark with.
2008-01-15T21:26:00.000Z	dgjones	Pici	ok, thanks, I'll do that
2008-01-15T21:27:00.000Z	dgjones	Pici	Excellent, thanks, that solved it for me, much appreciated
