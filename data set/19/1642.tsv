2011-01-19T22:21:00.000Z	erebel55		can anyone help me use my flash drive in ubuntu? I'm just trying to put some files on it.
2011-01-19T22:22:00.000Z	dnivra	erebel55	i think it's enough if you just plug it in to a USB drive.
2011-01-19T22:22:00.000Z	erebel55	dnivra	I tried that..but it isn't there when i look under computer
2011-01-19T22:24:00.000Z	dnivra	erebel55	could you pastebin the output of "sudo fdisk -l"
2011-01-19T22:24:00.000Z	erebel55		anyone?
2011-01-19T22:24:00.000Z	erebel55		yes

2011-01-19T22:25:00.000Z	dnivra	erebel55	is the flash drive plugged in? if not, do so. if it is, i guess it isn't being detected.
2011-01-19T22:26:00.000Z	erebel55	dnivra	yes its plugged in
2011-01-19T22:26:00.000Z	dnivra	erebel55	O
2011-01-19T22:26:00.000Z	erebel55		but i am trying to access it in a vm..i'm not sure if that matters
2011-01-19T22:26:00.000Z	dnivra	erebel55	oops sorry. did you say VM? Virtual Box?
2011-01-19T22:26:00.000Z	erebel55	dnivra	virtual machines yes
2011-01-19T22:27:00.000Z	erebel55		*machine
2011-01-19T22:27:00.000Z	dnivra	erebel55	it definitely does. are you using virtual box?
2011-01-19T22:28:00.000Z	erebel55	dnivra	I'm using vmware for a virtual machine
2011-01-19T22:30:00.000Z	dnivra	erebel55	well I think you have to specially enable access pen drives. least that is how it is in virtual box. search around.
