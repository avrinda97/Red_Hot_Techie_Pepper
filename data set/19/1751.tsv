2012-08-19T10:42:00.000Z	KM0201	plague	thats pretty easy.
2012-08-19T10:43:00.000Z	KM0201	plague	first, you'll need to create that user on the host.
2012-08-19T10:43:00.000Z	KM0201	plague	it's just as easy w/o a GUI
2012-08-19T10:43:00.000Z	plague	KM0201	ok crating user is pretty easy
2012-08-19T10:43:00.000Z	KM0201	plague	ok, so first create a user
2012-08-19T10:44:00.000Z	plague	KM0201	next?
2012-08-19T10:45:00.000Z	KM0201	plague	sudo smbpasswd -L -a username    (you'll be asked to enter and confirm a password for the user)
2012-08-19T10:45:00.000Z	KM0201	plague	it doesn't
2012-08-19T10:47:00.000Z	plague	KM0201	done
2012-08-19T10:48:00.000Z	KM0201	plague	sudo smbpasswd -L -e username    this will add the user to the samba group
2012-08-19T10:49:00.000Z	plague	KM0201	ok it says user enabled
2012-08-19T10:50:00.000Z	KM0201	plague	now.... sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf  (that should open up your samba configuration file)
2012-08-19T10:50:00.000Z	plague	KM0201	opened
2012-08-19T10:51:00.000Z	KM0201	plague	scroll to the very bottom, and add this (be sure to change the username, and set the description name.. to keep it simple, don't use spaces in the description name)...   http://pastebin.com/txTMNB9H
