2010-05-04T14:13:00.000Z	Ritlee		ummmm
2010-05-04T14:13:00.000Z	Ritlee	kjele	good question
2010-05-04T14:16:00.000Z	Ritlee	kjele	how might i find out? dmesg | grep ?? or ?
2010-05-04T14:17:00.000Z	kjele	Ritlee	Do you know what video card you are using at all?
2010-05-04T14:18:00.000Z	Ritlee		most likely a intel based card, but not off hand i can interrogate dell's website possibly
2010-05-04T14:18:00.000Z	kjele	Ritlee	lspci | grep VGA should tell
2010-05-04T14:19:00.000Z	Ritlee	kjele	945gme by intel
2010-05-04T14:19:00.000Z	kjele	Ritlee	Do you have a /etc/X11/xorg.conf file?
2010-05-04T14:20:00.000Z	Ritlee		doesn't appear to be one in the X11 dir
2010-05-04T14:21:00.000Z	Ritlee	kjele	doesn't appear to be there
2010-05-04T14:23:00.000Z	Ritlee	kjele	would xorg not be installed if it's .conf not be present? or is it just not configured?
2010-05-04T14:24:00.000Z	kjele	Ritlee	Then you should file a bug with "ubuntu-bug xserver-xorg-video-intel" and describe your suspend issue. In the mean time you can disable suspend with by edit the file /usr/share/polkit-1/actions/org.freedesktop.upower.policy Where it says "yes" you edit to "no"
2010-05-04T14:25:00.000Z	kjele	Ritlee	<allow_active>yes</allow_active>
2010-05-04T14:25:00.000Z	kjele	Ritlee	under suspend to no
2010-05-04T14:26:00.000Z	Ritlee	kjele	really... well that sucks... guess i'll be shutting down a lot
2010-05-04T14:26:00.000Z	kjele	Ritlee	Some bug do happen.
2010-05-04T14:26:00.000Z	Ritlee	kjele	yeah :(
2010-05-04T14:27:00.000Z	Ritlee	kjele	might give me the push to atleast try porting osx on to here in the mean time now that i know it's easily doable
