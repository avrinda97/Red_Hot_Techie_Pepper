2012-08-20T02:35:00.000Z	Jotek		Well, again: Hello everybody. I have a problem. I am running on Lubuntu, and Ive downloaded a "Tibia" client from its main site, and when I try to run it, there appears and window where I have to choose an application to make it works. When I choose terminal, nothing happens.
2012-08-20T02:37:00.000Z	Jotek		can anybody help me?
2012-08-20T02:38:00.000Z	openyost	Jotek	what file type is it?
2012-08-20T02:40:00.000Z	openyost	Jotek	from a quick look, it appears that Tibia is a windows program.  So i think the extension will be .exe
2012-08-20T02:41:00.000Z	Jotek	openyost	you have to choose between windows version and the linux one, ive choosen that compatible with linux
2012-08-20T02:42:00.000Z	Jotek	openyost	not really, go into "account" section and you will have there an option to download it without registering
2012-08-20T02:43:00.000Z	Jotek	openyost	ill be thankfull if Ill be able to play
2012-08-20T02:44:00.000Z	openyost	Jotek	I'm gonna try my best to help I'm not too used to how lubuntu works, I usually use ubuntu  It downloads as an archive file,  right click it and extract that in your download folder
2012-08-20T02:44:00.000Z	Jotek	openyost	i did it
2012-08-20T02:44:00.000Z	openyost	Jotek	so you were trying to run the StartTibia.sh file?
2012-08-20T02:46:00.000Z	Jotek	openyost	im now unable to do it (pc is under occupation) but ill try it when ill get it back to my hands
2012-08-20T02:46:00.000Z	Jotek	openyost	thanks alot =)
2012-08-20T02:46:00.000Z	openyost	Jotek	 making it able to run as a program should make it so you can easily run it.
2012-08-20T02:47:00.000Z	openyost	Jotek	 good luck!
2012-08-20T02:47:00.000Z	Jotek	openyost	i was checking properties of this file and I do not remember if there was a function to check 'run as program' but i cant say if there wasnt
2012-08-20T02:48:00.000Z	Jotek	openyost	thanks again for help mate :)
2012-08-20T02:49:00.000Z	Jotek	openyost	is there the same way to run it?
2012-08-20T02:49:00.000Z	openyost	Jotek	I just double clicked the Tibia file and it ran
2012-08-20T02:50:00.000Z	Jotek	openyost	when im doubleclicking it, then it gives me back a window to choose the best program to run it with
