2009-03-05T02:12:00.000Z	mori		Hi
2009-03-05T02:13:00.000Z	mori		I was trying to install ubuntu with unetbootui (or so) it did a netinstall, but failed at some point when downloading ubuntu desktop. I rebooted after it was stuck for an hours and now I get a "DISK BOOT FAILURE, INSERT SYSTEM DISK" error
2009-03-05T02:13:00.000Z	mori		And neither the broken ubuntu, nor my WinXP would boot anymore ;_;
2009-03-05T02:13:00.000Z	mori		any suggestions how I at least get my winxp working again?
2009-03-05T02:14:00.000Z	Dr_willis	mori	 boot a xp cd and use its recovery mode to reinstsall the boot loader. with the fixmbr/fixboot command
2009-03-05T02:14:00.000Z	Dr_willis	mori	 assuming the xp parittion is still there.
2009-03-05T02:14:00.000Z	mori		will try, second...
2009-03-05T02:16:00.000Z	mori		fixmbr /fixboot didn't work :(
2009-03-05T02:16:00.000Z	mori		Is that error a BIOS Error, a windows error or a grub error?
2009-03-05T02:18:00.000Z	mori		<BZH> mori put the cd od windows and see if some dll files are missing try repair windows <== I kinda doubt that, unless the ubuntu netinstall removes DLLs.
2009-03-05T02:18:00.000Z	mori		I just wonder what causes that error, is it the bios itself?
2009-03-05T02:18:00.000Z	Dr_willis	mori	 boot loader dident install proerly perhaps.. its hard to tell
2009-03-05T02:19:00.000Z	mori		well, fixmbr didn't work at least.
2009-03-05T02:19:00.000Z	mori		It's WinXP 32
2009-03-05T02:19:00.000Z	mori		Yes?
2009-03-05T02:19:00.000Z	Dr_willis	mori	 try fixboot
2009-03-05T02:20:00.000Z	mori	Dr_willis	- Tried that before. Can try again of course.
2009-03-05T02:20:00.000Z	Dr_willis	mori	 theres 2 commands that ive used fixboot, and fixmbr both do seperate things
2009-03-05T02:20:00.000Z	Dr_willis	mori	other then that.. I suggest going to #windows
