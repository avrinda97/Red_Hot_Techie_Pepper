2007-03-20T11:40:00.000Z	hendrixski	kikokos	have you googled it?
2007-03-20T11:41:00.000Z	hendrixski	kikokos	what kind of burner is it?
2007-03-20T11:42:00.000Z	kikokos	hendrixski	it`s nec nd-3540a
2007-03-20T11:42:00.000Z	hendrixski	kikokos	unfortunately not a lot of producers make LINUX drivers for their stuff,
2007-03-20T11:43:00.000Z	hendrixski	kikokos	but your burner will probablywork with open source drivers
2007-03-20T11:43:00.000Z	kikokos	hendrixski	but driver and update firmware it`s the same?>
2007-03-20T11:45:00.000Z	kikokos	hendrixski	so maybe you know how to update firmware ?
2007-03-20T11:46:00.000Z	hendrixski	kikokos	I misunderstood your question.  I don't think I know how to do that
