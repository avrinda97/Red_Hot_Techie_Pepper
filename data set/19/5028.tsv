2011-05-31T16:57:00.000Z	phaidros		where to configure autologin into the terminal on  boot? as we dont have inittab anymore, I wonder how is that done nowadays :)
2011-05-31T16:57:00.000Z	phaidros		any hints?
2011-05-31T16:58:00.000Z	DasEi	phaidros	unity or gnome ?
2011-05-31T16:59:00.000Z	phaidros	DasEi	Terminal, no X
2011-05-31T17:07:00.000Z	DasEi	phaidros	sorry, was distracted in another tab, got your answer ?
2011-05-31T17:07:00.000Z	phaidros	DasEi	nope, still need a way to log into the console after boot, no X on the machine though
2011-05-31T17:08:00.000Z	DasEi	phaidros	/etc/gdm/gdm.conf , there you can change the bools of autologin
2011-05-31T17:08:00.000Z	phaidros	DasEi	then again, there is no X on that machine, hence no gdm. I need to login to the first Console
2011-05-31T17:10:00.000Z	DasEi	phaidros	just look if it's there, or /etc/gdm/custom.conf
2011-05-31T17:11:00.000Z	phaidros	DasEi	GDM is responsible for login to X Servers, I have no X on my machine. hence GDM is useless here. this issue was formerly handled by /etc/inittab, which is not existing anymore on ubuntu, it got replaced by upstart.
2011-05-31T17:13:00.000Z	DasEi	phaidros	sudo apt-get install mingetty
2011-05-31T17:14:00.000Z	phaidros	DasEi	yeah!
2011-05-31T17:14:00.000Z	DasEi	phaidros	sudo nano /etc/init/tty1.conf
2011-05-31T17:14:00.000Z	phaidros	DasEi	yeah! thats it!
2011-05-31T17:14:00.000Z	phaidros	DasEi	where did  you find this?
2011-05-31T17:15:00.000Z	DasEi	phaidros	/sbin/getty to   /sbin/mingetty --autologin UserNameHere tty1
2011-05-31T17:15:00.000Z	DasEi	phaidros	upstart
2011-05-31T17:16:00.000Z	DasEi	phaidros	where would I be , if no one pushed me here and then , have fun
2011-05-31T17:16:00.000Z	phaidros	DasEi	lol
