2009-05-09T11:08:00.000Z	behnam		Hello
2009-05-09T11:09:00.000Z	behnam		I'm looking for a way to synchronize two hards disk, I mean : I have a partition on which I often add files, and I want to add the last added files to the second hard disk
2009-05-09T11:09:00.000Z	behnam		How can I do ?
2009-05-09T11:09:00.000Z	Drikan	behnam	do you want to move them or just copy?
2009-05-09T11:09:00.000Z	behnam		copy
2009-05-09T11:10:00.000Z	Drikan	behnam	then the string would be    CP file file file dir
2009-05-09T11:10:00.000Z	Drikan	behnam	i meen cp file file file dir    this assumes your are in the dir where the files you want to move are
2009-05-09T11:11:00.000Z	behnam	Drikan	That's not one or two files =/
2009-05-09T11:12:00.000Z	behnam	Drikan	it's files in differents folders
2009-05-09T11:12:00.000Z	Drikan		then you can copy the dir
2009-05-09T11:12:00.000Z	Drikan		bhnam: cp dir destdir
2009-05-09T11:13:00.000Z	behnam	Drikan	Oh yes copy the "father repertory" ! But where should I put the "diff" thing ?
2009-05-09T11:13:00.000Z	Drikan	behnam	im sorry you want to cp -r dir destdir
2009-05-09T11:14:00.000Z	Drikan	behnam	that will copy all files and folder recursive
2009-05-09T11:15:00.000Z	behnam	Drikan	Ok, but I want only changed files, that's why I was talking about the diff thing you said
2009-05-09T11:15:00.000Z	Drikan	behnam	are you trying just to copy the newer files?
2009-05-09T11:16:00.000Z	Drikan	behnam	then it would be cp -ru
2009-05-09T11:16:00.000Z	behnam	Drikan	Some other people are advising me rsyng, I'm going to look about this, but thanks anyway I'll remember your commands !
2009-05-09T11:19:00.000Z	Drikan	behnam	you can also look at the different options with cp by typig " cp --help " or "man cp"
