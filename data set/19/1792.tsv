2011-04-08T21:16:00.000Z	defsum		Hello, need help with getting working USB Sound device (Ubuntu 10.10, ALSA 1.0.24). Card shows in 'aplay -l' and 'pavucontrol', but no sound.
2011-04-08T21:17:00.000Z	meganerd	defsum	did you change the default output in the Preferences -> Sound
2011-04-08T21:17:00.000Z	defsum	meganerd	Yes, sure
2011-04-08T21:17:00.000Z	meganerd	defsum	yes, or sure
2011-04-08T21:18:00.000Z	meganerd	defsum	what USB sound card is this?
2011-04-08T21:18:00.000Z	defsum	meganerd	Yes. Mackie Spike XD-2.
2011-04-08T21:20:00.000Z	defsum	meganerd	card also present in default Gnome output list as "Mackie XD-2 Analog stereo", checked as default, but no sound.
2011-04-08T21:21:00.000Z	defsum	meganerd	this sound card was working in previous installations of Ubuntu, thus somehow it's POSSIBLE to get it working
2011-04-08T21:26:00.000Z	meganerd	defsum	on my system I have it under System -> Preferences -> Sound -- then hardware tab, as well as output tab
2011-04-08T21:26:00.000Z	defsum	meganerd	I have it there too on my system, but no sound
2011-04-08T21:27:00.000Z	defsum	meganerd	even LEDs on Card itself don't work
2011-04-08T21:27:00.000Z	meganerd	defsum	anything in dmesg when you plug it in?  Some of these USB devices require a firmware blob to work
2011-04-08T21:28:00.000Z	meganerd	defsum	my vantec 7.1 USB just worked out of the box
2011-04-08T21:28:00.000Z	defsum	meganerd	that's alrady more complicated, now let's speak in command quotes) what should I type in terminal?
2011-04-08T21:29:00.000Z	meganerd	defsum	"dmesg"
2011-04-08T21:29:00.000Z	defsum	meganerd	done, wait a min
2011-04-08T21:30:00.000Z	defsum	meganerd	disconnected>connected: http://pastebin.com/EEL9Q47C
2011-04-08T21:35:00.000Z	defsum	meganerd	I switched "Profile" in Sound Preferences under my USB device, now it gone from Output list, an there's only Dummy Output. :'-(
2011-04-08T21:38:00.000Z	defsum	meganerd	I switched "Profile" to IEC958 and it returned back to Outpust list, but still now actual sound.
