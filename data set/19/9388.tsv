2011-02-08T18:37:00.000Z	qdk		How do I recover from a broken (due to poweroutage) 10.04 -> 10.10 upgrade?
2011-02-08T18:38:00.000Z	jrib	qdk	depends when the power outage happened.  Have you attempted to simply upgrade again?
2011-02-08T18:39:00.000Z	qdk	jrib	about when the new package were being set up... after reboot the X still says 10.04, but its broken so I can not login.
2011-02-08T18:39:00.000Z	jrib	qdk	can you log in at a tty?
2011-02-08T18:40:00.000Z	qdk	jrib	no, I even tried booting into single, which doesnt work either.
2011-02-08T18:40:00.000Z	jrib	qdk	what happens exactly?
2011-02-08T18:41:00.000Z	qdk	jrib	The computer shutdowndue to overheating... or at least thats what some autobullshit thinks when reaching 100c for a short while.
2011-02-08T18:42:00.000Z	jrib	qdk	and that happens exactly when you attempt to login?
2011-02-08T18:43:00.000Z	qdk	jrib	couldnt login... everything is just not working.
2011-02-08T18:45:00.000Z	jrib	qdk	I understand, but if you're not descriptive, then it's hard to help you.
2011-02-08T18:47:00.000Z	qdk	jrib	There is nothing else to tell... I just need to either restart the upgrade process or reinstall without wiping the disk... Why the computer shut down doesnt make any diff.
2011-02-08T18:48:00.000Z	jrib	qdk	right.  So I'm asking you to tell me exactly what happens when you try to log in at tty1
2011-02-08T18:48:00.000Z	qdk	jrib	I cant. The keyboard doesnt work.
2011-02-08T18:49:00.000Z	jrib	qdk	good, that's important information.  Does the keyboard also not work in recovery mode?
2011-02-08T18:51:00.000Z	qdk	jrib	recovery mode? as in single user mode?
2011-02-08T18:52:00.000Z	jrib	qdk	"recovery mode" from the grub menu.  What do you mean by "single user mode" exactly (how did you enter it)?
2011-02-08T18:59:00.000Z	qdk	jrib	single user mode is runlevel 1, where you get some recovery thingy where services and stuff hasnt been started... And that is broken too. so Im trying to chroot into the disk (using desktop bootcd) which is spoke a bit about with Sonne earlier.
2011-02-08T19:00:00.000Z	jrib	qdk	yes, recovery mode is the same.  I'm just asking how you entered it because I've seen people call lots of different things single user mode.  If that's broken too, then yes you should chroot and try to fix your packages from there
2011-02-08T19:18:00.000Z	jrib	qdk	aye... good luck :)
