2009-11-14T18:12:00.000Z	om26er	K3rl0u4rn	using karmic fully? fully updated?
2009-11-14T18:05:00.000Z	K3rl0u4rn	om26er	wasn't my question clear ?
2009-11-14T18:05:00.000Z	om26er	K3rl0u4rn	repeat
2009-11-14T18:05:00.000Z	K3rl0u4rn	om26er	I just installed karmic koala (xubuntu) and having trouble with some administrative tasks such as installing nvidia drivers... the action is refused. Also on e.g. shared folders, I can't "unlock" the widgets
2009-11-14T18:05:00.000Z	om26er	K3rl0u4rn	sorry a bit of confusion
2009-11-14T18:06:00.000Z	om26er	K3rl0u4rn	sudo jockey-gtk and try to install driver
2009-11-14T18:10:00.000Z	K3rl0u4rn	om26er	seems that it worked... should I use sudo whatever to launch other "system" apps ? (shared folders, login screens etc...) ?
2009-11-14T18:10:00.000Z	om26er	K3rl0u4rn	so great na?
2009-11-14T18:11:00.000Z	om26er	K3rl0u4rn	when you open system app it should ask you for password on its own
2009-11-14T18:11:00.000Z	K3rl0u4rn	om26er	I know, but it doesn't
2009-11-14T18:12:00.000Z	om26er	K3rl0u4rn	sudo apt-get --reinstall install gksu
2009-11-14T18:12:00.000Z	K3rl0u4rn	om26er	when I sudo gdmsetup, I can click the unlock button but everything stays greyed, and the unlock button itself becomes grey :)
2009-11-14T18:13:00.000Z	K3rl0u4rn	om26er	fresh install this morning + updates + install of software I usually use
2009-11-14T18:14:00.000Z	K3rl0u4rn	om26er	However, I haven't logged in with xfce, I use openbox, maybe that can be a reason but I doubt
2009-11-14T18:14:00.000Z	K3rl0u4rn	om26er	acording to what I read on google, this is probably related to policykit
2009-11-14T18:14:00.000Z	K3rl0u4rn	om26er	reinstalling gksu did not change anything :(
2009-11-14T18:39:00.000Z	K3rl0u4rn	om26er	finally, I got it... my openbox startup script did not launch /usr/lib/policykit-1-gnome/polkit-gnome-authentication-agent-1
2009-11-14T18:39:00.000Z	K3rl0u4rn	om26er	everything worked fine under xfce actually
2009-11-14T18:39:00.000Z	om26er	K3rl0u4rn	great
