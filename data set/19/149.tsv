2012-08-12T04:32:00.000Z	Cromat		I never could get use to fedora
2012-08-12T04:34:00.000Z	Cromat		tried: Most likely just bad luck on my part
2012-08-12T04:34:00.000Z	Cromat		tried: I'll give it another go now
2012-08-12T04:34:00.000Z	Cromat		been wanting to do a nothing install on empty drive
2012-08-12T04:36:00.000Z	Cromat		lol -- tried: The requested URL /pub/linux/fedora/releases/17/Live/x86_64/Fedora-17-x86_64-Live-Desktop.iso was not found on this server
2012-08-12T04:37:00.000Z	Cromat		just a bad mirror going now
2012-08-12T04:37:00.000Z	Cromat		Does anyone here use SublimeText2? Is it worth the 59.99?
2012-08-12T04:37:00.000Z	Debolaz	Cromat	Imho, yes.
2012-08-12T04:38:00.000Z	Debolaz	Cromat	I use it on Mac, Windows, and Linux and it's my preferred editor in all those environments.
2012-08-12T04:38:00.000Z	Cromat	Debolaz	Is the license good across all os's
2012-08-12T04:39:00.000Z	Debolaz	Cromat	Yes.
2012-08-12T04:39:00.000Z	Cromat	Debolaz	I have a mac book pro at work, and I use only linux at home
2012-08-12T04:39:00.000Z	Cromat	Debolaz	cool, then I might have to get it
2012-08-12T04:39:00.000Z	Debolaz	Cromat	Keep in mind that you can evaluate sublime for free.
2012-08-12T04:39:00.000Z	Debolaz	Cromat	So you can see if you like it before you buy it.
2012-08-12T04:41:00.000Z	Debolaz	Cromat	Btw, you can install sublime through apt-get: http://www.webupd8.org/2012/06/sublime-text-20-stable-released-ppa.html
2012-08-12T04:41:00.000Z	Cromat	Debolaz	Cool I just downloaded the tarball
2012-08-12T04:42:00.000Z	Cromat	Debolaz	But the ppa might have unity integration by default
2012-08-12T04:42:00.000Z	Debolaz	Cromat	Installing through the PPA has the advantage that it will integrate it properly into your system.
