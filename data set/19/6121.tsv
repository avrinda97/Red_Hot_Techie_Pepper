2008-09-23T02:05:00.000Z	sebastian__		%
2008-09-23T02:05:00.000Z	sebastian__		in the system monitor resources
2008-09-23T02:06:00.000Z	Alfarin	sebastian__	ssh in, type top and hit enter, see what's running w/ high cpu
2008-09-23T02:06:00.000Z	Alfarin		er... forget ssh in, just start terminal, lol :X
2008-09-23T02:06:00.000Z	Alfarin		too used to working w/ server remotely :X
2008-09-23T02:07:00.000Z	sebastian__	Alfarin	the Root is
2008-09-23T02:07:00.000Z	Alfarin		what process?
2008-09-23T02:07:00.000Z	sebastian__	Alfarin	sorry the xorg
2008-09-23T02:08:00.000Z	Alfarin		xorg...  only thing that rings a bell from my experience when when I messed up and installed xwin server or something when I was trying to get compiz fusion working w/ an outdated tutorial a while back.... only resolution to that for me was to uninstall the xserver thing it recommended.
2008-09-23T02:09:00.000Z	sebastian__	Alfarin	can i kill the process or is it critical?
2008-09-23T02:10:00.000Z	Alfarin	sebastian__	do not kill xorg, or else you'll lose your xwindows
2008-09-23T02:10:00.000Z	sebastian__	Alfarin	but whats wrong with it?
2008-09-23T02:10:00.000Z	sebastian__	Alfarin	it worked fine before untill now
2008-09-23T02:11:00.000Z	Alfarin		something you've installed must've been mis-configured or mis-configured xorg some how... were you trying to install anything just before this happened?
2008-09-23T02:12:00.000Z	sebastian__	Alfarin	is it a way to see the tree of the process to see what is causing it?
2008-09-23T02:13:00.000Z	Alfarin	sebastian__	 do you have htop installed?  though, I don't know if xorg have any child processes... :X
2008-09-23T02:14:00.000Z	sebastian__	Alfarin	no im installing it now, i see on the internet that many has the same problem
