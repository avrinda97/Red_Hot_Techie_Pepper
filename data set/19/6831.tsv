2007-11-30T21:44:00.000Z	CrashOverride		a playstation 2 has 2 USB plugs on it
2007-11-30T21:44:00.000Z	CrashOverride		that you can plug ubn plugs into
2007-11-30T21:44:00.000Z	CrashOverride		* usb
2007-11-30T21:45:00.000Z	CrashOverride		O.o
2007-11-30T21:45:00.000Z	CrashOverride		I'll get a picture on google
2007-11-30T21:45:00.000Z	CrashOverride		type A
2007-11-30T21:47:00.000Z	CrashOverride		I wonder if someone could get linux installed on a digital alarm clock
2007-11-30T21:48:00.000Z	CrashOverride		ya
2007-11-30T21:48:00.000Z	CrashOverride		I have this cable that's type A on one end and B on the other
2007-11-30T21:49:00.000Z	CrashOverride		B is the more square one right
2007-11-30T21:49:00.000Z	ampex_	CrashOverride	correct
2007-11-30T21:50:00.000Z	ampex_	CrashOverride	what is "it" and what type of modem?
2007-11-30T21:51:00.000Z	ampex_	CrashOverride	why do you want to plug a DSL modem into a PS2? and how does this relate to ubunty?
2007-11-30T21:52:00.000Z	ampex_	CrashOverride	get a router
2007-11-30T21:53:00.000Z	ampex_	CrashOverride	or if your PC has two network interfaces you can use it as a router
2007-11-30T21:53:00.000Z	ampex_	CrashOverride	then your only choice is to A. get a router or B. buy another network card for your PC and learn how to setup ubuntu as a router
2007-11-30T21:53:00.000Z	ampex_	CrashOverride	in most cases A. is simpler
2007-11-30T21:55:00.000Z	ampex_	CrashOverride	what are you trying to achieve?
2007-11-30T21:56:00.000Z	ampex_	CrashOverride	I don't believe that is possible via the USB port and it also has nothing to do with ubuntu
