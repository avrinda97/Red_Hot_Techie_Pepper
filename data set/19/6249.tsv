2008-02-20T03:38:00.000Z	soundray	nasamo	what do you want to do with firestarter?
2008-02-20T03:40:00.000Z	soundray	nasamo	you don't need firestarter unless you want to route network traffic for other computers.
2008-02-20T03:40:00.000Z	soundray	nasamo	ubuntu does not open any network ports by default, so you are safe without configuring the firewall.
2008-02-20T03:41:00.000Z	soundray	nasamo	yes, firestarter is suitable for configuring internet sharing if you don't have a router.
2008-02-20T03:42:00.000Z	soundray	nasamo	be careful to spell my nick correctly, otherwise I might miss your replies.
2008-02-20T03:42:00.000Z	nasamo	soundray	ok, sorry...
2008-02-20T03:43:00.000Z	nasamo	soundray	it there a faster way to write nicks besides tying or pasting
2008-02-20T03:44:00.000Z	soundray	nasamo	try typing soun and completing it with the Tab key
2008-02-20T03:44:00.000Z	nasamo	soundray	besides, I can't find my question mark either
2008-02-20T03:44:00.000Z	soundray	nasamo	do you have a dialup connection?
2008-02-20T03:45:00.000Z	soundray	nasamo	brazilian keyboard?
2008-02-20T03:45:00.000Z	nasamo	soundray	i guess so...
2008-02-20T03:45:00.000Z	soundray	nasamo	I don't know those -- you might find help for that in #ubuntu-br
2008-02-20T03:45:00.000Z	nasamo	soundray	the configuration is brazilian, but the keyboard isn't
2008-02-20T03:45:00.000Z	nasamo	soundray	thanks
2008-02-20T03:46:00.000Z	soundray	nasamo	I see -- in that case, you should just switch to another layout
2008-02-20T03:46:00.000Z	soundray	nasamo	System-Preferences-Keyboard
2008-02-20T03:46:00.000Z	nasamo	soundray	ok, I'll try that...
