2009-01-29T03:19:00.000Z	quentin	sifr	They do indeed
2009-01-29T03:19:00.000Z	sifr	quentin	cool, check it out. i've grown quite fond of it over the past few weeks.
2009-01-29T03:19:00.000Z	quentin	sifr	It looks nice, very easy to use
2009-01-29T03:21:00.000Z	sifr	quentin	yes its v. clean indeed and customisable too, key mappings are available if u decide to change that behaviour and can switch to full screen with jsut a key press. :D joy!
