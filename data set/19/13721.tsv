2005-02-13T13:48:00.000Z	Martok		I want to compile my packages from source, not the whole system.
2005-02-13T13:49:00.000Z	Martok		Thanks for nothing!
2005-02-13T13:49:00.000Z	Martok		What's that do?
2005-02-13T13:50:00.000Z	Martok		Yeah, I know!
2005-02-13T13:50:00.000Z	Martok		I've compiled my own kernel before you troll!
2005-02-13T13:51:00.000Z	Martok		Whoa!
2005-02-13T13:51:00.000Z	Martok		Somebody just one upped somebody else!
2005-02-13T13:53:00.000Z	Martok		Whoa, whoa... save it for the Windows users troll_god.
2005-02-13T13:53:00.000Z	Martok		We're all Linux users here... we're all ok.
2005-02-13T13:54:00.000Z	Martok		We're all using the same kernel, damn!
2005-02-13T13:55:00.000Z	cutterjohn	Martok	do you generate .deb packages for your self compiled packages?
2005-02-13T14:00:00.000Z	cutterjohn	Martok	...and a little faster, but I really like xfce too... as opposed to pure GNOME desktop
2005-02-13T14:01:00.000Z	cutterjohn	Martok	fluxbox (CVS) isn't bad either... a little spartan, but...
2005-02-13T14:01:00.000Z	Martok	cutterjohn	Actually, yes. I like fluxbox too.
2005-02-13T14:02:00.000Z	cutterjohn	Martok	you ever look at 5dwm or whatever it is called these days?  (meant to replicate indigo magic... thats nice too...)
2005-02-13T14:03:00.000Z	cutterjohn	Martok	SGI's IRIX X desktop... best I'd ever seen on UNIX c. 1995...
2005-02-13T14:04:00.000Z	cutterjohn	Martok	only openstep was close...
2005-02-13T14:04:00.000Z	cutterjohn	Martok	when you write one...
2005-02-13T14:26:00.000Z	cutterjohn	Martok	couldn't remember, and never tried it as it sounded as though it might be too easy to hose the wrong process that way... }:)
