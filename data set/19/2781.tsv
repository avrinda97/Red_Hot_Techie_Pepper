2010-04-27T22:02:00.000Z	Losha	es	please paste the *exact* text of the error message to http://ubuntu.pastebin.com
2010-04-27T22:05:00.000Z	Losha	es	it's very strange. ls and ld are two completely different applications. g++ uses ld, not ls. So I don't understand why your error messages talk about "ls"...
2010-04-27T22:05:00.000Z	es	Losha	yeah
2010-04-27T22:06:00.000Z	Losha	es	do you have any aliases e.g. have you defined ld as something? Type: alias to see...
2010-04-27T22:07:00.000Z	Losha	es	yes, and guess which program does the linking: ld
2010-04-27T22:08:00.000Z	Losha	es	run with -v to see what the compiler is doing...
2010-04-27T22:10:00.000Z	es	Losha	geekphreak with the -v option http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/ADt325RP
2010-04-27T22:14:00.000Z	Losha	es	no, build-id is a legitimate ld option. Which os version is this?
2010-04-27T22:15:00.000Z	es	Losha	Ubuntu 9.10
2010-04-27T22:16:00.000Z	Losha	es	4.4.1 is quite old. Do you want to upgrade the compiler?
2010-04-27T22:17:00.000Z	es	Losha	really? aptitude shows everything is updated though....
2010-04-27T22:18:00.000Z	es	Losha	do you think I hit a bug?
2010-04-27T22:19:00.000Z	Losha	es	it seems odd that you would be the first person to see this. Consider reinstalling the compilers?
2010-04-27T22:20:00.000Z	es	Losha	it is weird isn't it? how can I force a reinstall?
2010-04-27T22:21:00.000Z	Losha	es	Try sudo apt-get install --reinstall gcc g++
2010-04-27T22:22:00.000Z	es	Losha	didn't worked :/ same errors
2010-04-27T22:26:00.000Z	Losha	es	you need more expert help than I can provide. Consider asking on #gcc
2010-04-27T22:27:00.000Z	es	Losha	they send me here :/
2010-04-27T22:29:00.000Z	Losha	es	you need to compare your systems gcc -v output with someone else running 9.10...
