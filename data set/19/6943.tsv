2007-11-05T10:42:00.000Z	Exedor		but no matter where i look theres no option anywhere in admin or prefs for screen brightness
2007-11-05T10:43:00.000Z	Exedor		people were saying they got around it by going to prefs>power management and setting the brightness there but when i got there i only have a very few options listed
2007-11-05T10:43:00.000Z	Exedor		none of which related to screen brightness
2007-11-05T10:44:00.000Z	vook	Exedor	I probably should get out of here - I'm of the debian breed.  Maybe a package from the default feisty install is no longer installed in the gutsy?  I have no idea...  (aptitude search acpi buttons) ??.  good luck
