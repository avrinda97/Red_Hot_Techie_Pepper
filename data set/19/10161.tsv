2007-05-06T07:41:00.000Z	xipietotec		ah, I kind of misread it...and opened the whole range, heh
2007-05-06T07:42:00.000Z	xipietotec		changed it to 55000-55756
2007-05-06T06:16:00.000Z	xipietotec		okay, I kinda screwed something up with using nautilus as root... I need to change the contents of /usr/share/gdm/theme's to have root as owner with read write and execute permissions for all files, and then have me accessfiles, what's the chmod command for this? (I found the chmod man page a little confusing
2007-05-06T06:17:00.000Z	xipietotec		so it's better to use chmod -R ...something something
2007-05-06T06:18:00.000Z	roryy	xipietotec	use chown to change ownership; something like 'chown -R root.root /the/dir/of/interest/'
2007-05-06T06:18:00.000Z	xipietotec	roryy	allready did that, but now I need to change permissions, essentially root group has no read permissions on hundereds of files
2007-05-06T06:19:00.000Z	xipietotec		so gdm can't read the files
2007-05-06T06:19:00.000Z	roryy	xipietotec	xipietotec:     chmod -R u+rwX /the/dir/of/interest/     to give root perms; g+rwX to give group, and o+rX to give others access
2007-05-06T06:20:00.000Z	roryy	xipietotec	make that g+rX for group permissions; I see that is what I have
2007-05-06T06:20:00.000Z	roryy	xipietotec	you might find 'info coreutils chmod' to be more informative than the manpage
2007-05-06T06:22:00.000Z	xipietotec	roryy	okay, so if the owner and group is root, and the dir is /usr/share/gdm/themes/* and I want others to be able to look at the files (But not change them) what should the line look like?
2007-05-06T06:22:00.000Z	roryy	xipietotec	i'd run chmod 3 times, first with u+rwX, then g+rX, then o+rX
2007-05-06T06:23:00.000Z	xipietotec		ah, okay
2007-05-06T06:23:00.000Z	roryy	xipietotec	it might well be possible to combine those into one command
2007-05-06T06:23:00.000Z	xipietotec		so the first line should be chmod -R root u+rwX /etc...?
2007-05-06T06:23:00.000Z	roryy	xipietotec	no
2007-05-06T06:23:00.000Z	roryy	xipietotec	chmod -R u+rwX /your/directory/
2007-05-06T06:24:00.000Z	roryy	xipietotec	do be careful with this ;) you can really screw up your system if you change perms on the wrong files
2007-05-06T06:26:00.000Z	xipietotec	roryy	I'm aware, I rarely ever touch my root file system...I just happened to do something stupid with nautilus. If you open up nautilus as root, and have a separate non-root nautilus open, and you drag files from there into the root nautilus, it keeps your user permissions
