2005-08-08T09:41:00.000Z	sorush20		I don't know what caused it.. i could be back shutdown, extensions install or ect.. but I do know that its not possible to run the TB on root or any other user ... all I want to do is run as the default user.. I was however at some point was able to make a new profile and run TB then... but I don't want to do that.. I want to fix so that I can run as default.. so... I'm here to ask...
2005-08-08T09:42:00.000Z	sorush20		for help.. I have two types of problems  1) I get the message that the default user is in use - which can't can't be the case since I'm the only user
2005-08-08T09:43:00.000Z	jasoncohen	sorush20	do you have TB open- "ps ax grep thunderbird"
2005-08-08T09:43:00.000Z	jasoncohen	sorush20	"ps ax | grep thunderbird"
