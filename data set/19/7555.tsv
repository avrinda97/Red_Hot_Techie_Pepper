2007-10-30T11:04:00.000Z	brack10		i think they were reverse engineered
2007-10-30T11:05:00.000Z	brack10		hey I have a question for y'all smart people
2007-10-30T11:05:00.000Z	brack10		I tried to open up my first torrent in azureus and it closed immediately and now it won't open.  it shows the splash screen and initializes and then instantly closes when it launches
2007-10-30T11:05:00.000Z	brack10		I tried reinstalling it
2007-10-30T11:05:00.000Z	brack10		rebooting
2007-10-30T11:05:00.000Z	brack10		anyone know?
2007-10-30T11:06:00.000Z	brack10		okay
2007-10-30T11:06:00.000Z	murlidhar	brack10	did u do some configuring in azureus
2007-10-30T11:08:00.000Z	murlidhar	brack10	open the applications in the terminal and see what error is it giving?
2007-10-30T11:13:00.000Z	murlidhar	brack10	wait
2007-10-30T11:15:00.000Z	murlidhar	brack10	try sudo dkpg-reconfigure azureus.  Beware you will lose every setting and the torrents present in azureus . so do a back up of your torrents first
2007-10-30T11:17:00.000Z	murlidhar	brack10	what did it say
2007-10-30T11:17:00.000Z	murlidhar	brack10	k wait
2007-10-30T11:18:00.000Z	murlidhar	brack10	ahh it should be dkpg
2007-10-30T11:19:00.000Z	murlidhar	brack10	i think i am missing the correct command
2007-10-30T11:22:00.000Z	murlidhar	brack10	<warbler> I use rtorrent for the speed - but sudo dpkg-reconfigure azureas would be a good start - not dkpg
