2012-05-15T00:42:00.000Z	alex-		True, but where do I have to ask then auronandace
2012-05-15T00:42:00.000Z	alex-		?
2012-05-15T00:42:00.000Z	alex-		In MATE or Mint channel they'll probably say: Ubuntu isn't supported here
2012-05-15T00:43:00.000Z	alex-		Nah, I'm looking in a way to fix this
2012-05-15T00:43:00.000Z	alex-		I can't open any program anymore
2012-05-15T00:43:00.000Z	alex-		Quicksynergy won't start, update manager won't start, software center won't start
2012-05-15T00:43:00.000Z	alex-		I can't even apt-get upgrade
2012-05-15T00:43:00.000Z	BlueEagle	alex-	Did you attempt to install MATE on natty?
2012-05-15T00:44:00.000Z	alex-	BlueEagle	11.04 is natty?
2012-05-15T00:45:00.000Z	BlueEagle	alex-	Because what the error message is saying that the version of MATE you are attempting to install requires pkg-config version 0.36-1 or higher but Natty only has 0.25-1 availible.
2012-05-15T00:47:00.000Z	BlueEagle	alex-	apt-get remove -f libgail-dev libgtk2.0-0 and libgtk2.0-dev
2012-05-15T00:58:00.000Z	alex-	BlueEagle	same error :|
2012-05-15T00:59:00.000Z	BlueEagle	alex-	So you are not able to force remove the pakcages either?
2012-05-15T00:59:00.000Z	alex-	BlueEagle	nope
2012-05-15T01:02:00.000Z	BlueEagle	alex-	dpkg --remove --force-all libgail-dev
2012-05-15T01:02:00.000Z	BlueEagle	alex-	If that doesn't take it then I fear nothing will. :/
2012-05-15T01:03:00.000Z	alex-	BlueEagle	i still got problems with other packages
2012-05-15T01:03:00.000Z	BlueEagle	alex-	Then you insert them instead of libgail-dev
2012-05-15T01:22:00.000Z	alex-	BlueEagle	Thanks, this did the job
