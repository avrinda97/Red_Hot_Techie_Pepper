2012-11-05T11:03:00.000Z	rsv		how much space i need to reserve for default ubuntu
2012-11-05T11:03:00.000Z	Erin	rsv	when you format the disk you just make / on one partition /home on another
2012-11-05T11:03:00.000Z	Erin	rsv	id say 10-15gb to be safe...
2012-11-05T11:04:00.000Z	rsv	Erin	for default ubuntu?
2012-11-05T11:04:00.000Z	Erin	rsv	yea im on 12.10 and my / uses under 4 gB with xfce gui lol
2012-11-05T11:04:00.000Z	rsv	Erin	will it ask me if i re-install ubuntu
2012-11-05T11:04:00.000Z	rsv	Erin	i also have windows in my disk
2012-11-05T11:04:00.000Z	Erin	rsv	yes it will, tell it to setup partitions on your disk. and make / and /home on seperate partitions
2012-11-05T11:04:00.000Z	Erin	rsv	manually that is.
2012-11-05T11:05:00.000Z	rsv	Erin	when u say manually what is it
2012-11-05T11:05:00.000Z	Erin	rsv	its an option in the setup, when you get to the partitioning section you tell it that you are gonna do it manually
2012-11-05T11:05:00.000Z	Erin	rsv	then you tell it to make one for / about 10gb to be safe id say and one for /home and /swap thats all you need
2012-11-05T11:06:00.000Z	Erin	rsv	how much ram you got ?
2012-11-05T11:08:00.000Z	rsv	Erin	is there an app to check how much is my ram
2012-11-05T11:10:00.000Z	rsv	Erin	this one was loaned to me by my boss
2012-11-05T11:11:00.000Z	rsv	Erin	accordingly you want me to have a 32gb swap?
2012-11-05T11:11:00.000Z	rsv	Erin	8gb of swap
2012-11-05T11:11:00.000Z	Erin	rsv	8gb should be plenty swap is hardly ever used anyway its when ram gets full I believe
