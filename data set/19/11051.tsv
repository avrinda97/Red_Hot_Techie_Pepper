2006-04-15T06:27:00.000Z	venin		fedora is easier i think.. since u can type "yum install and yum search" instead of "apt-get install and apt-cache search"
2006-04-15T06:27:00.000Z	venin		:)
2006-04-15T06:28:00.000Z	Sanne	venin	you can make an alias for apt-get and apt-cache :)
2006-04-15T06:38:00.000Z	Sanne	venin	you need the kernel sources or the kernel headers (might be enough) to compile alsa kernel modules. You can usually get those through synaptic or apt-get. Make sure the versions of your installed and running (!) kernel match those of the headers/source package.
2006-04-15T06:39:00.000Z	venin	Sanne	im using 2.6.12-9 .. so i should find a kernel source using apt--get ?
2006-04-15T06:40:00.000Z	Sanne	venin	yes, or synaptic or packages-ubuntu-com.
2006-04-15T06:40:00.000Z	Sanne	venin	make that packages.ubuntu.com
2006-04-15T06:41:00.000Z	Sanne	venin	linux-image is the kernel binary. Sec.
2006-04-15T06:43:00.000Z	venin	Sanne	cant find
2006-04-15T06:43:00.000Z	Sanne	venin	you need linux-headers-<version> or linux-source-<version>
2006-04-15T06:43:00.000Z	Sanne	venin	type the output of uname -a please.
2006-04-15T06:44:00.000Z	Sanne	venin	if it matches your kernel version, yes.
2006-04-15T06:46:00.000Z	venin	Sanne	now configure worked :D
2006-04-15T06:46:00.000Z	Sanne	venin	nice :)
2006-04-15T06:52:00.000Z	venin	Sanne	after i did ./configure make and make install on alsa-driver-1.0.9b_26 i did a "alsamixer -h" and it said alsamixer v1.0.9a .. why? how can i see if the drivers is updated?
2006-04-15T06:53:00.000Z	Sanne	venin	I don't really know, I never compiled alsa from source.
2006-04-15T06:53:00.000Z	venin	Sanne	 i had to i think.. i have to blacklist snd_hda_intel in order to get past hotplug starting at boot
2006-04-15T06:54:00.000Z	venin	Sanne	some issue with realtek acl880 or something
2006-04-15T06:56:00.000Z	Sanne	venin	I'm afraid that's a bit over my head, sorry. Hopefully somebody else can help further.
