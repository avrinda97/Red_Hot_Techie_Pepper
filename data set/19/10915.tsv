2006-06-15T12:35:00.000Z	keleus	iiiears	he uses his windows box for a proxy and gateway... and sometimes it refuses connections for no apparent reason
2006-06-15T12:36:00.000Z	keleus	iiiears	i brought up the 10 connection/second limitation and a workaround, but that wasnt the problem
2006-06-15T13:39:00.000Z	keleus	iiiears	maybe this should be in #security :)
2006-06-15T12:41:00.000Z	iiiears	keleus	- Ubuntu.. Ubuntu/ - #Ubuntu - lol
2006-06-15T13:16:00.000Z	iiiears	keleus	- Glad you are here for networking questions.
2006-06-15T13:17:00.000Z	keleus	iiiears	thanks ( im assuming your not being sarcastic :) ).
2006-06-15T13:18:00.000Z	iiiears	keleus	- I wish you were here more often.
2006-06-15T13:35:00.000Z	iiiears	keleus	- How do you discover the default password without setting up limited user accounts?
2006-06-15T13:37:00.000Z	keleus	iiiears	there is no default password, windows is smart in that they deny all remote logins to users with no passwords (administrator is usually one, if your machine came retail)
2006-06-15T13:39:00.000Z	iiiears	keleus	- so "Owner" "Administrator" will answer the password challenge for samba? - Can it be changed locally/remotely?
2006-06-15T13:39:00.000Z	keleus	iiiears	im not sure what your asking
2006-06-15T13:41:00.000Z	iiiears	keleus	- lol - you are right. - I just couldn't get samba working without using user accounts. (My wife hates the slow boot up and trusts everyone. even Nigerian embassadors. - lol).
2006-06-15T13:46:00.000Z	iiiears	keleus	- Ah, Option to set a password for that shared drive. - problem solved. - Thank You.
2006-06-15T13:47:00.000Z	iiiears	keleus	- Why a mamber of the administrator group?
2006-06-15T13:48:00.000Z	keleus	iiiears	that makes the user an administrator. the "c$" is ahidden share of C:\ with full read and write... its only open to administrator accounds (administrator or any member of the group "administartors")
2006-06-15T14:08:00.000Z	iiiears	keleus	- one word "VMWare" - lol
2006-06-15T14:30:00.000Z	iiiears	keleus	- If i learn any more info i am going to need to forget something just to make room.
2006-06-15T14:32:00.000Z	iiiears	keleus	- don't get too attached to him. He is an amnesiac.
