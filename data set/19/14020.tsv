2004-12-14T12:33:00.000Z	diesel		Is there a net install of ubuntu?  From my experience the cd install of ubuntu is COMPLETELY broken
2004-12-14T12:33:00.000Z	theine	diesel	is it?
2004-12-14T12:34:00.000Z	diesel	theine	yes it is.
2004-12-14T12:35:00.000Z	theine	diesel	what exactly is broke? i'm just curious
2004-12-14T12:37:00.000Z	theine	diesel	really? that's bad
2004-12-14T12:40:00.000Z	theine	diesel	and that was
2004-12-14T12:40:00.000Z	theine	diesel	sorry
2004-12-14T12:41:00.000Z	theine	diesel	how did you remformatted your hard disk?
2004-12-14T12:42:00.000Z	diesel	theine	first I tried with the ubuntu installer...that did not do anything.  Then I used fdisk to reformat.  Then went back into the installer and tried again.  no luck.
2004-12-14T12:44:00.000Z	theine	diesel	isn't there an option ``use entire disk''? that doesn't work either?
2004-12-14T12:48:00.000Z	theine	diesel	what partitioning scheme did you choose?
2004-12-14T12:48:00.000Z	diesel	theine	I used automatic partitioning where there is a / and a swap
2004-12-14T12:48:00.000Z	theine	diesel	reasonable choice
2004-12-14T12:49:00.000Z	theine	diesel	how many times did you try all together?
2004-12-14T13:07:00.000Z	theine	diesel	don't forget to tell everyone else what you think of Ubuntu
2004-12-14T13:08:00.000Z	diesel	theine	I like the idea of ubuntu, just think that implementation is bad, really bad.
2004-12-14T13:09:00.000Z	theine	diesel	too bad you don't get a chance to really try it out
2004-12-14T13:14:00.000Z	theine	diesel	but it's essentially the same installer (d-i)
2004-12-14T13:14:00.000Z	theine	diesel	:)
