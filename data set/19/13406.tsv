2005-05-22T07:31:00.000Z	Dalkus	HappyFool	yes
2005-05-22T07:31:00.000Z	HappyFool	Dalkus	err, hmm ?
2005-05-23T05:18:00.000Z	HappyFool	Dalkus	du -s $(find -type d -maxdepth 1)
2005-05-23T05:29:00.000Z	HappyFool	Dalkus	it relinks the file (assuming you're moving the file within the same partition)
2005-05-23T05:30:00.000Z	HappyFool	Dalkus	not sure what happens if you mv across partitions, but I guess a copy-delete is the only option in that case
2005-10-07T06:02:00.000Z	HappyFool	Dalkus	you can't mount music CD's, as far as i know
2005-10-07T06:02:00.000Z	HappyFool	Dalkus	what do you want to do?
2005-10-07T06:02:00.000Z	Dalkus	HappyFool	how can I read one then?
2005-10-07T06:03:00.000Z	HappyFool	Dalkus	use a cd-ripper tool, like sound juicer or cdparanoia
2005-10-07T06:03:00.000Z	Dalkus	HappyFool	but I just want to listen to it - I don't want to rip it?
2005-10-07T06:03:00.000Z	HappyFool	Dalkus	oh
2005-10-07T06:03:00.000Z	HappyFool	Dalkus	applications -> sound and video -> cd player
2005-10-07T06:04:00.000Z	HappyFool	Dalkus	mounting won't fix that
2005-10-07T06:04:00.000Z	HappyFool	Dalkus	it doesn't give any more details?
2005-10-07T06:05:00.000Z	HappyFool	Dalkus	well, it works here
2005-10-07T06:06:00.000Z	HappyFool	Dalkus	can you try a different music cd?
2005-10-07T06:06:00.000Z	Dalkus	HappyFool	all the same :)
2005-10-07T06:06:00.000Z	HappyFool	Dalkus	hmm. sorry, not sure what the problem is; maybe look in dmesg to see if the kernel reports any errors
2005-10-16T11:45:00.000Z	HappyFool	Dalkus	try 'rm -- -x'
