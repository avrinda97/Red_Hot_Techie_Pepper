2006-06-20T06:16:00.000Z	Pxtl		Linux n00b here.  Can anyone help me get xorg to work with my voodoo2?
2006-06-20T06:17:00.000Z	Pxtl		I'm getting a "failed to load module glide"
2006-06-20T06:18:00.000Z	Pxtl		but every glide module I can google I've tried to apt get and it complains there's no such thing.
2006-06-20T06:18:00.000Z	oskude	Pxtl	have you installed this "xserver-xorg-driver-voodoo" ? if that is for voodoo2...
2006-06-20T06:19:00.000Z	oskude	Pxtl	i allso found this "xserver-xorg-driver-tdfx" with "apt-cache search voodoo"
2006-06-20T06:20:00.000Z	oskude	Pxtl	what do you have as "driver" in /etc/X11/xorg.conf ?
2006-06-20T06:21:00.000Z	oskude	Pxtl	but "man voodoo" allso says "3D rendering is also not supported" so if youre looking for that...
2006-06-20T06:22:00.000Z	Pxtl	oskude	grepping for "Driver" gives me "Glide"
2006-06-20T06:23:00.000Z	oskude	Pxtl	you should have "voodoo" as driver
2006-06-20T06:24:00.000Z	oskude	Pxtl	as i said voodoo driver dont have any 3d accelleration, so it wont have opengl...
2006-06-20T06:25:00.000Z	oskude	Pxtl	yeah, buy cheap nvidia geforce

2006-06-20T07:03:00.000Z	oskude	Pxtl	glide2-bin is a driver ?
2006-06-20T07:04:00.000Z	oskude	Pxtl	hmm i read "graphics library for 3Dfx Voodoo based cards" so no driver, just a library...
2006-06-20T07:06:00.000Z	oskude	Pxtl	ah you where the one with voodoo2 ? then you need this "xserver-xorg-driver-voodoo" and set "voodoo" as driver...
