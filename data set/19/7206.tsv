2009-10-10T07:43:00.000Z	bazhang	robert__	the array kernel is not a Ubuntu product
2009-10-10T07:44:00.000Z	robert__	bazhang	i know but its a question i don't know the answer to and its for Ubuntu
2009-10-10T07:44:00.000Z	bazhang	robert__	as such, some have success; you may wish to talk the makers (they generally are on eeeuser.com forum or #eeepc )
2009-10-10T07:45:00.000Z	robert__	bazhang	i have an msi netbook, its an atom processor so i'm assuming it will work the same
2009-10-10T07:46:00.000Z	bazhang	robert__	better to ask in the appropriate channel for support
2009-10-10T07:46:00.000Z	robert__	bazhang	this would be the best channel for my question since there is no array channel
2009-10-10T07:47:00.000Z	robert__	bazhang	i know that, but maybe someone can still answer questions
2010-02-13T09:56:00.000Z	bazhang	robert__	no
2010-02-13T09:56:00.000Z	bazhang	robert__	#ubuntu+1 for lucid issues
2010-02-13T10:03:00.000Z	bazhang	robert__	are you using karmic?
2010-02-13T10:03:00.000Z	robert__	bazhang	lucid
2010-02-13T10:03:00.000Z	bazhang	robert__	this is not the support channel for lucid.
2010-02-13T10:04:00.000Z	bazhang	robert__	as I said before it is in #ubuntu+1
2010-03-13T04:26:00.000Z	robert__	bazhang	he helped me
2010-03-13T04:26:00.000Z	robert__	bazhang	he also helped me realize i need to dump kinky koala and go either forward or backward
2010-03-13T04:26:00.000Z	bazhang	robert__	its karmic koala
2010-03-13T04:27:00.000Z	robert__	bazhang	i know that lol
2010-06-19T20:51:00.000Z	bazhang	robert__	in #ubuntu-se
