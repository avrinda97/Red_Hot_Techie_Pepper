2008-09-15T06:15:00.000Z	acrousey		i forget this: when burning a downloaded iso, what is the best speed to burn it to a disk at?
2008-09-15T06:16:00.000Z	acrousey		i know i don't want to go at max speed
2008-09-15T06:16:00.000Z	acrousey		isn't 16x good or should i go slower?
2008-09-15T06:16:00.000Z	keepsake	acrousey	what's wrong with max speed?
2008-09-15T06:17:00.000Z	acrousey	keepsake	I think i remember there being errors going at max
2008-09-15T06:17:00.000Z	keepsake	acrousey	oh, then lower it a notch or two
2008-09-15T06:17:00.000Z	keepsake	acrousey	what kind of disc is it?
2008-09-15T06:17:00.000Z	acrousey	keepsake	cd-r
2008-09-15T06:18:00.000Z	keepsake	acrousey	what are you burning onto the cd? (music/application/movie/etc?)

2008-09-15T06:19:00.000Z	keepsake	acrousey	Burn at top speed, but verify the disk.
2008-09-15T06:19:00.000Z	acrousey		how do i verify it?
2008-09-15T06:19:00.000Z	keepsake	acrousey	There should be an option in your burning software.
2008-09-15T06:19:00.000Z	acrousey	keepsake	i'm using brasero
2008-09-15T06:19:00.000Z	acrousey		ok
