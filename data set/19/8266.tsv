2007-11-24T22:18:00.000Z	RoyK		hi
2007-11-24T22:18:00.000Z	RoyK		is there a place I can find custom ubuntu kernel packages? I have a rather old laptop, so building by hand takes for ages. i need to upgrade to 2.6.23 to fix a wlan-related bug
2007-11-24T22:19:00.000Z	magnetron	RoyK	take a look at distcc, it could speed up your compile times drastically
2007-11-24T22:21:00.000Z	RoyK	magnetron	it takes longer to set that up than to compile the kernel
2007-11-24T22:22:00.000Z	RoyK	magnetron	also there are custom patches to make splash screen work, and I want that
2007-11-24T22:22:00.000Z	magnetron	RoyK	er du sikker?
2007-11-24T22:22:00.000Z	RoyK	magnetron	anyway - do you know the answer to my original question?
2007-11-24T22:25:00.000Z	magnetron	RoyK	if it's not in a repository, you will have to compile it yourself. if your laptop is fast, just compile it. otherwise, get distcc. sudo apt-get install distcc
2007-11-24T22:26:00.000Z	RoyK	magnetron	well, I was wondering if you knew some other sources, like with debian, where you can get many non-official kernels
2007-11-24T22:27:00.000Z	RoyK	magnetron	but i guess you don't know any
2007-11-24T22:33:00.000Z	RoyK	magnetron	bummer. no 2.6.23 there. any idea where i can find the ubuntu-specific kernel patches?
2007-11-24T22:34:00.000Z	magnetron	RoyK	.23? there is no kernel package for ubuntu released for that kernel, that's too new
2007-11-24T22:51:00.000Z	RoyK	magnetron	bummer. no 2.6.23 there. any idea where i can find the ubuntu-specific kernel patches?
2007-11-24T22:51:00.000Z	magnetron	RoyK	.23? there is no kernel package for ubuntu released for that kernel, that's too new
2007-11-24T22:52:00.000Z	RoyK	magnetron	I saw that, but I need it because of this silly wlan/802.11 bug
2007-11-24T22:53:00.000Z	magnetron	RoyK	installing distcc takes less time than hanging around here, trying to get answers that no ne has :)
2007-11-24T22:54:00.000Z	RoyK	magnetron	now, I was merely asking a question. did you read the whole of it?
2007-11-24T22:54:00.000Z	magnetron	RoyK	yes, and i read it when you repeated it too
2007-11-24T22:55:00.000Z	magnetron	RoyK	i gave you all help i have
