2008-02-18T12:41:00.000Z	psion		hrm, has anyone here gotten mplayer to go to full screen correctly on a second monitor via dual heads?
2008-02-18T12:42:00.000Z	ph0rensic	psion	hold on lemme check
2008-02-18T12:42:00.000Z	psion	ph0rensic	ty
2008-02-18T12:43:00.000Z	ph0rensic	psion	what u see when u do it
2008-02-18T12:44:00.000Z	psion	ph0rensic	it maximizes, but it's like the screen is too small to display it all, it cuts off the bottom and right
2008-02-18T12:44:00.000Z	ph0rensic	psion	I just loaded an HD clip and it maximized but looked widescreen (top and bottom black)
2008-02-18T12:45:00.000Z	psion	ph0rensic	was it skewed?
2008-02-18T12:45:00.000Z	ph0rensic	psion	Nope, Im thinking the resolution fits for how it looked
2008-02-18T12:45:00.000Z	ph0rensic	psion	Umm perhaps I should try another media
2008-02-18T12:46:00.000Z	psion	ph0rensic	did you modify or do anything special with mplayer?
2008-02-18T12:46:00.000Z	ph0rensic	psion	nothing I had never used it till itried lol
2008-02-18T12:46:00.000Z	psion	ph0rensic	I'm trying to figure out if my problem is with mplayer or my config of xorg
2008-02-18T12:48:00.000Z	ph0rensic	psion	wht about totem?
2008-02-18T12:49:00.000Z	psion	ph0rensic	totem?
2008-02-18T12:49:00.000Z	ph0rensic	psion	its another player
2008-02-18T12:49:00.000Z	ph0rensic	psion	or try vlc thats a good one
2008-02-18T12:54:00.000Z	psion	ph0rensic	it appears to work fine in totem, odd
2008-02-18T12:54:00.000Z	ph0rensic	psion	yah mplayer prolly just sux
2008-02-18T12:55:00.000Z	psion	ph0rensic	mplayer is my fav player, I just have to figure out how to get it to work dualhead
