2010-06-12T16:04:00.000Z	ohhai	Botanic	ubuntu on 256 ram isnt a good idea
2010-06-12T16:04:00.000Z	Botanic	ohhai	well its that or windows XP...
2010-06-12T16:05:00.000Z	ohhai	Botanic	windows xp
2010-06-12T16:05:00.000Z	ohhai	Botanic	ubuntu is far too bloated for 256 ram
2010-06-12T16:05:00.000Z	Botanic	ohhai	ya its time to play the hack n slash game
2010-06-12T16:06:00.000Z	ohhai	Botanic	i'd go for another distro with less bloat
2010-06-12T16:06:00.000Z	Botanic	ohhai	this is for a friend all he does is internet but he needs simple, so tbh id rather it be a bit slow and easy then harder and faster
2010-06-12T16:07:00.000Z	ohhai	Botanic	what makes ubuntu an easier than another distro running gnome ?
2010-06-12T16:07:00.000Z	ohhai	Botanic	lol no.
