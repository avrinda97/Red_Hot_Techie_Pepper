2008-04-03T13:42:00.000Z	bengb		I need to create folders for users, I want everyone to be able to write to the folders. I don't want everyone to be able to write/delete or list files in the folders though.
2008-04-03T13:43:00.000Z	bengb		I just want the folders owner to be able to read/delete
2008-04-03T13:44:00.000Z	bengb		I hoped that wrxwrx-w-
2008-04-03T13:44:00.000Z	bengb		would work, but it doesn't
2008-04-03T13:45:00.000Z	bengb		I guess it's one of those things you can't do in linux
2008-04-03T13:47:00.000Z	bengb		I want to make a directory for each user on my network. I want them to be able to rwx, and everyone else to just be able to write to the folder
2008-04-03T13:47:00.000Z	bengb		so that people can drop files into their folder
2008-04-03T13:47:00.000Z	bengb		but can't view what's in the folder
2008-04-03T13:47:00.000Z	bengb		using samba
2008-04-03T13:47:00.000Z	bengb		yes
2008-04-03T13:47:00.000Z	compwiz18	bengb	theoretically, you can make the folders contents writable, but not reaable
2008-04-03T13:54:00.000Z	bengb	compwiz18	if the directory is not executable then you can't create files
2008-04-03T13:59:00.000Z	compwiz18	bengb	what group/user are the folders?
2008-04-03T14:01:00.000Z	compwiz18	bengb	can you set up permissions in samba for the folders?
2008-04-03T14:13:00.000Z	compwiz18	bengb	is that what you want?
2008-04-03T14:14:00.000Z	compwiz18	bengb	# Files that have their Linux permissions set to prevent access shouldn't even appear
2008-04-03T14:18:00.000Z	compwiz18	bengb	you could do something tricky with mount -o bind and stuff
2008-04-03T14:18:00.000Z	compwiz18	bengb	you can do that too :)
2008-04-03T14:28:00.000Z	compwiz18	bengb	http://lists.samba.org/archive/samba/2001-November/031321.html maybe that would help?
