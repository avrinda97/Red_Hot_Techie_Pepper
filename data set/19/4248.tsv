2009-02-22T16:48:00.000Z	mollyringwald		booting up ubuntu for the first time and it freezes on startup WHAT COULD BE CAUSING THIS OH GOD
2009-02-22T16:49:00.000Z	hmw	mollyringwald	real freeze? can you switch to console with CTRL-ALT-F2 ?
2009-02-22T16:50:00.000Z	mollyringwald	hmw	just tried it then; nothing. the background is black and the grey loading circle in the middle is the screen is stuck
2009-02-22T16:51:00.000Z	hmw	mollyringwald	sounds like a real freeze. can be virtually anything. try booting in safe mode (or similar)
2009-02-22T16:51:00.000Z	hmw	mollyringwald	you could boot in single user mode (ask others for how to) and examine /var/log/Xorg.0.log (single user for not booting X again)
2009-02-22T16:52:00.000Z	hmw	mollyringwald	you could even try to get SSH up for the next normal boot and login from outside. sshd still works often, when you think the box is frozen.
2009-02-22T16:54:00.000Z	hmw	mollyringwald	try recovery mode. if it comes up, install the ssh server, so you can login next time the machine freezes
2009-02-22T16:55:00.000Z	hmw	mollyringwald	"freezes" - in many cases i still could log in, when the box seemed to be dead
2009-02-22T17:01:00.000Z	hmw	mollyringwald	you will need to install it first... sudo apt-get install sshd
2009-02-22T17:03:00.000Z	hmw	mollyringwald	you will need to install it first... sudo apt-get install sshd
2009-02-22T17:07:00.000Z	hmw	mollyringwald	yes. its remote shell access (like the terminal but over ip) - in case your x freezes, you often still can connect from outside and investigate. thats why i recommended it
2009-02-22T17:10:00.000Z	hmw	mollyringwald	too bad, this makes things a little more complicated. can ANYONE ELSE HERE help on how one could get the Xorg log of a crashing boot, when rebooted in recovery mode?
2009-02-22T17:11:00.000Z	hmw	mollyringwald	- possibly a GPU driver issue. what GPU do you have?
2009-02-22T17:13:00.000Z	hmw	mollyringwald	we are talking about recovery
2009-02-22T17:29:00.000Z	hmw	mollyringwald	i got a procedure for you. want to try to get your log to a pastebin?
2009-02-22T17:33:00.000Z	hmw	mollyringwald	you still there?
2009-02-22T17:37:00.000Z	hmw	mollyringwald	i have a procedure for extracting the xorg log for you - does the machine have internet access?
2009-02-22T17:38:00.000Z	hmw	mollyringwald	gah.... some usb flash disk available?
2009-02-22T17:38:00.000Z	hmw	mollyringwald	or a floppy disk?
