2007-11-04T13:07:00.000Z	smmagic		Xlib: extension "GLX" missing on display ":0.0". Anyone know how to fix that error?
2007-11-04T13:09:00.000Z	smmagic		Can someone help me?
2007-11-04T13:10:00.000Z	confuzed	smmagic	just ask your question... we don't know if we can help yet
2007-11-04T13:10:00.000Z	confuzed	smmagic	oops I see your question above
2007-11-04T13:10:00.000Z	confuzed	smmagic	where are you seeing this?
2007-11-04T13:11:00.000Z	confuzed	smmagic	what are you trying to accomplish... just installing new graphics drivers or something
2007-11-04T13:12:00.000Z	confuzed	smmagic	what video adapter
2007-11-04T13:14:00.000Z	confuzed	smmagic	yeah... your trying to get GLX and DRI working on your system... these are highly dependant upon the video card.
2007-11-04T13:14:00.000Z	confuzed	smmagic	did you simply try installing the nvidia restricted drivers
2007-11-04T13:15:00.000Z	confuzed	smmagic	you might simply need to modify the options line in your Xorg.conf file for GLX?
2007-11-04T13:17:00.000Z	confuzed	smmagic	is there a line under the Section Module that says Load "glx" and Load "dri"?
2007-11-04T13:17:00.000Z	confuzed	smmagic	yes
2007-11-04T13:19:00.000Z	confuzed	smmagic	I'll pastebin my file... if you have the restricted drivers installed then all of the sections relating to the display should work for you
2007-11-04T13:21:00.000Z	confuzed	smmagic	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/43228/
2007-11-04T13:23:00.000Z	confuzed	smmagic	yeah I read back... oh and please get in the habit of replying directly to the person your talking too... just put their name somewhere in your file so your comment gets highlighted.  TAB will complete if the name is just a pain to type.
2007-11-04T13:24:00.000Z	confuzed	smmagic	in your file -> in your comment
2007-11-04T13:24:00.000Z	smmagic	confuzed	K, sorry
2007-11-04T13:25:00.000Z	confuzed	smmagic	much better... then I would have been able to scan the history much more quickly!  Actually I would have seen your comment through my transparent windows (I love compiz!)
2007-11-04T14:05:00.000Z	confuzed	smmagic	the slow channels have the most knowledgeable people on the topic... but often it's hours before anyone replies or even talks in those channels... you need to be patient
