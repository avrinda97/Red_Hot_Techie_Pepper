2005-02-19T13:18:00.000Z	webby		does anyone know what i'm doing wrong with regards to compiling my own kernels? why i run a custom kernel, the system seem's to lag, like it's under high load.
2005-02-19T13:20:00.000Z	webby		anybody?
2005-02-19T13:21:00.000Z	Cuga_	webby	well you have to tell us a little more info then that, what kernel, what patches, what scheduler.. ?
2005-02-19T13:22:00.000Z	webby	Cuga_	not sure which scheduler, I think I left that as the default ubuntu config. the only patch I applied was an inotify patch, to vanila 2.6.10 sources
2005-02-19T13:22:00.000Z	Cuga_	webby	which ubuntu config? hoary or warty
2005-02-19T13:23:00.000Z	webby	Cuga_	warty. i copied the 2.6.8 config to the 2.6.10 directory, then did make oldconfig
2005-02-19T13:24:00.000Z	Cuga_		that guy has issues
2005-02-19T13:24:00.000Z	Cuga_		that guy has bad issues :)
2005-02-19T13:24:00.000Z	Cuga_		ok webby, does it seem to lag only in X?
2005-02-19T13:25:00.000Z	webby	Cuga_	terminal seems fine, but haven't done much testing
2005-02-19T13:25:00.000Z	Cuga_		do you use accelerated drivers?
2005-02-19T13:25:00.000Z	Cuga_		for video
2005-02-19T13:26:00.000Z	webby		I've got the fglrx driver installed for my old kernel, but not this one yet
2005-02-19T13:26:00.000Z	Cuga_		why dont you try and compile for this kernel to elimate that issue, might just be cause X is in VESA mode (slow as hell)
2005-02-19T13:27:00.000Z	webby	Cuga_	does the ati driver use vesa? I thought that driver was ok
2005-02-19T13:27:00.000Z	Cuga_	webby	no ATI driver uses its own kernel mods, VESA only used if all else fails
2005-02-19T13:28:00.000Z	Cuga_	webby	but it has to be compiled against the running kernel to work
2005-02-19T13:28:00.000Z	webby	Cuga_	ok, so build the kernel module then?
2005-02-19T13:28:00.000Z	webby	Cuga_	I'll give it a go
