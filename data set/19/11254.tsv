2006-03-27T07:35:00.000Z	bart_		what values i need to enter for 1280x960 framebuffer support?
2006-03-27T07:36:00.000Z	YukiCuss	bart_	research tells me you can't get that resolution.
2006-03-27T07:37:00.000Z	bart_	YukiCuss	any higher poss than 1024x768?
2006-03-27T07:37:00.000Z	YukiCuss	bart_	sure.

2006-03-27T07:37:00.000Z	YukiCuss	bart_	which one do you want? :)
2006-03-27T07:37:00.000Z	YukiCuss	bart_	see http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Framebuffer-HOWTO-5.html <-- scroll to section 5.3. make sure to convert from hex to decimal before you enter it into your cmomand line
2006-03-27T07:38:00.000Z	bart_	YukiCuss	i know for 1024x768 it's vga=773...
2006-03-27T07:38:00.000Z	YukiCuss	bart_	there are several different ones, depending on what bitdepth you want.
2006-03-27T07:38:00.000Z	YukiCuss	bart_	see above page, it will reveal all.
2006-03-27T07:38:00.000Z	bart_	YukiCuss	thanks! i check it...
2006-03-27T07:38:00.000Z	YukiCuss	bart_	actually, 773 is for 8-bit 1024x768.
2006-03-27T07:43:00.000Z	bart_	YukiCuss	i need for a friend of mine with a 17 inch lcd screen a high resolution at 24 bts depth... which one?
2006-03-27T07:43:00.000Z	YukiCuss	bart_	for a 17", i'd go no higher than 1280x1024.
2006-03-27T07:44:00.000Z	YukiCuss	bart_	0x31b, vga=795
