2011-02-20T11:06:00.000Z	ohsix	bazhang	he was here earlier about that; all his external drives stopped working at some point, not just one
2011-03-24T05:26:00.000Z	ohsix	bazhang	padevchooser is deprecated/obsolete
2011-03-24T05:27:00.000Z	bazhang	ohsix	in favor of what? its in maverick and natty still
2011-03-24T05:28:00.000Z	ohsix	bazhang	pavucontrol, and i don't see padevchooser around anymore
2011-03-24T05:29:00.000Z	ohsix	bazhang	you have to go out of your way to install it
2011-03-24T05:29:00.000Z	bazhang	ohsix	that hardly means obselete
2011-03-24T05:29:00.000Z	ohsix	bazhang	anyways, this isn't very important, theres like 2 checkboxes that are in padevchooser that load modules that people rely on
2011-03-24T05:30:00.000Z	ohsix	bazhang	i didn't base my judgement on whether you have to manually install it, it's long from upstream
2011-03-24T05:37:00.000Z	ohsix	bazhang	fwiw, gnome-volume-control can do everything aside from moving streams; but its device tab does move streams as people expect
2011-03-24T11:22:00.000Z	bazhang	ohsix	among others
2011-03-24T12:40:00.000Z	bazhang	ohsix	stop that
2011-04-04T18:15:00.000Z	bazhang	ohsix	lets move on please
2011-04-04T18:23:00.000Z	bazhang	ohsix	BluesKaj lets stop it now
2011-04-04T18:24:00.000Z	ohsix	bazhang	please review what he provided and speak to the situation
2011-04-18T19:35:00.000Z	ohsix	bazhang	media player classic on windows probably plays them fine too; what's the point?
2011-05-13T10:40:00.000Z	bazhang	ohsix	PseudoGou thats enough
2011-05-13T10:41:00.000Z	bazhang	ohsix	?
2011-05-13T10:42:00.000Z	ohsix	bazhang	uncalled for
2011-05-13T10:42:00.000Z	bazhang	ohsix	drop it
