2012-10-11T16:06:00.000Z	BlackPanx		and removing bottom toolbar with windows listed... that's another fail. -.-
2012-10-11T16:07:00.000Z	BlackPanx		even with fallback to gnome3
2012-10-11T16:07:00.000Z	BlackPanx		you still dont get it back
2012-10-11T16:07:00.000Z	BlackPanx		you need to install some aditional program
2012-10-11T16:07:00.000Z	BlackPanx		to get it
2012-10-11T16:07:00.000Z	BlackPanx		back
2012-10-11T16:07:00.000Z	BlackPanx		the bottom windows toolbar.
2012-10-11T16:07:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	BlackPanx	 what do you mean, I have it
2012-10-11T16:08:00.000Z	BlackPanx		yes
2012-10-11T16:08:00.000Z	BlackPanx		exactly
2012-10-11T16:11:00.000Z	BlackPanx	Pici	it's still not the same. conflicts with other windows... if it would be integrated into gnome3 it would be better imo.
2012-10-11T16:11:00.000Z	BlackPanx		besides it makes 2 lines, one for ubuntu's desktop's and one for windows... it's terrible
2012-10-11T16:11:00.000Z	BlackPanx		hard to explain... wait i upload screenshot
2012-10-11T16:16:00.000Z	BlackPanx		http://picpaste.com/pics/bottom_window_bar-FBDfyog3.1349957779.png
2012-10-11T16:16:00.000Z	BlackPanx		this is problematic
2012-10-11T16:16:00.000Z	BlackPanx		workspaces in their own line
2012-10-11T16:17:00.000Z	BlackPanx		and another line of window bar...
2012-10-11T16:17:00.000Z	BlackPanx		useless
2012-10-11T16:17:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	BlackPanx	 i like it that way
