2010-03-30T12:07:00.000Z	zetheroo		it seems to me that after a while of the system running things start getting a bit muddled up and everything takes a bit longer than before ... till it gets to the point where I just have to reboot  .... :(
2010-03-30T12:08:00.000Z	tvaughn	zetheroo	who reboots
2010-03-30T12:08:00.000Z	zetheroo	tvaughn	who?
2010-03-30T12:08:00.000Z	zetheroo	tvaughn	I reboot the computer ...
2010-03-30T12:08:00.000Z	tvaughn	zetheroo	why?
2010-03-30T12:10:00.000Z	zetheroo	tvaughn	as I said ... things slow down ... like maximising an open PP presentation from it's minimized position or even pasting a line in here ... it's like the hdd has to constantly play catch up to something for several second before anything happens
2010-03-30T12:12:00.000Z	tvaughn	zetheroo	try closing firefox?
2010-03-30T12:13:00.000Z	zetheroo	tvaughn	yeah ... not really a solution ... FF should be only taking up what it needs
2010-03-30T12:13:00.000Z	tvaughn	zetheroo	thought linux was past the whole rebooting thing :|
2010-03-30T12:14:00.000Z	zetheroo	tvaughn	yeah - ha
2010-03-30T12:14:00.000Z	tvaughn	zetheroo	you use gnome?
2010-03-30T12:14:00.000Z	zetheroo	tvaughn	yes
2010-03-30T12:15:00.000Z	tvaughn	zetheroo	that may be a problem
2010-03-30T12:15:00.000Z	zetheroo	tvaughn	no special setup or anything either ...
2010-03-30T12:15:00.000Z	zetheroo	tvaughn	gnome is sluggish?
2010-03-30T12:15:00.000Z	zetheroo	tvaughn	first time I heard that ....
2010-03-30T12:17:00.000Z	tvaughn	zetheroo	I read that legs....
2010-03-30T12:18:00.000Z	tvaughn	zetheroo	everyone has heard of gnome being sluggish, its common knowledge
2010-03-30T12:18:00.000Z	zetheroo	tvaughn	well ... now it is even more common than before :P
