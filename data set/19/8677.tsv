2007-03-10T06:34:00.000Z	Rei-chan		Yay. :) I'm currently on a Command Line Gentoo box, and this thing needs Ubuntu.
2007-03-10T06:34:00.000Z	Rei-chan		Since its got less than 128MB RAM, I am grabbing the Alternate Install CD, whatever that is.
2007-03-10T06:34:00.000Z	Biscuitian_Warhe	Rei-chan	oh ok, what do you need help with it?
2007-03-10T06:36:00.000Z	Biscuitian_Warhe	Rei-chan	right, right. i've used ubuntu so long so I cant' stand the desktop install.
2007-03-10T06:41:00.000Z	Biscuitian_Warhe	Rei-chan	Assuming you use gentoo, I'll assume you're pretty savy. I have a NTFS part, but linux sees it as swap, but everything is there right
2007-03-10T06:42:00.000Z	Biscuitian_Warhe	Rei-chan	No it's any linux box, windows refuses to boot (no error) and other apps seeing it as ntfs
2007-03-10T06:42:00.000Z	Biscuitian_Warhe	Rei-chan	Arch linux is nice :P
2007-03-10T06:44:00.000Z	Rei-chan	Biscuitian_Warhe	Hmm. That's... very odd. Unfortunately I'm not sure what's going on. Have you examined the partition to verify its actually an NTFS partition?
2007-03-10T06:44:00.000Z	Biscuitian_Warhe	Rei-chan	Well in gparted it comes up as an 82 gigabyte swap partition set to boot
2007-03-10T06:45:00.000Z	Rei-chan	Biscuitian_Warhe	Wow. That's... wtf. It should know its an NTFS partition.
2007-03-10T06:45:00.000Z	Biscuitian_Warhe	Rei-chan	do you think it's a partition table issue?
2007-03-10T06:46:00.000Z	Rei-chan	Biscuitian_Warhe	I'd verify with fdisk that its actually set to NFTS, yes. I'm kinda grasping at straws, I've never seen anything like that. Every box I've had knew that a certain partition was either FAT or NTFS based.
2007-03-10T06:46:00.000Z	Rei-chan	Biscuitian_Warhe	Since multiple boxes think its swap instead of NTFS, I'd say its the partition and not the linux software.
2007-03-10T06:46:00.000Z	Biscuitian_Warhe	Rei-chan	See, with the latest wines I can play all my games (halo, guild wars, cod2, etc)
2007-03-10T06:47:00.000Z	Biscuitian_Warhe	Rei-chan	So yeah, i just wanna vmware itunes
2007-03-10T06:47:00.000Z	Rei-chan	Biscuitian_Warhe	Yeah, when I rebuild my normal PC, I plan to throw wine on and boom, run em.
2007-03-10T06:48:00.000Z	Rei-chan	Biscuitian_Warhe	You own an iPod and use iTunes store to buy stuff, don't you?
2007-03-10T06:48:00.000Z	Biscuitian_Warhe	Rei-chan	I'm more of a banshee person myself, though I heard songbird is good
2007-03-10T06:48:00.000Z	Biscuitian_Warhe	Rei-chan	Yup
