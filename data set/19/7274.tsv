2009-04-07T04:51:00.000Z	arooni-mobile		hey folks!  my silly business partner messed up ubuntu ibex;  now when i boot up i see "checking drive /dev/sda1: 18%; /dev/sda1: Inodes that were part of a corrupted orphan linked list found;  /dev/sda1: Unexpected inconsistency: Run fsck manually (i..e without -a or -p options);  fsck died with exit status 4;  * an automatic file system check of the root file system failed, a manual fsck must be performed, then the system restarte
2009-04-07T04:51:00.000Z	arooni-mobile		d, the fsck should be performed in maintenance mode with the root filesystem mounted in read only mode; the root file system is currently mounted in read-only mode;
2009-04-07T04:51:00.000Z	arooni-mobile		how should i fix?
2009-04-07T04:51:00.000Z	Shishire	arooni-mobile	boot recovery mode
2009-04-07T04:51:00.000Z	arooni-mobile	Shishire	from which cd?
2009-04-07T04:51:00.000Z	Shishire	arooni-mobile	then run the specified command
2009-04-07T04:52:00.000Z	arooni-mobile	Shishire	and what is the specified command
2009-04-07T04:52:00.000Z	arooni-mobile	Shishire	so i dont need to boot it up off a cd?
2009-04-07T04:53:00.000Z	Shishire	arooni-mobile	no, you don't.  booting off of a cd may feel nicer, but its not necessary
2009-04-07T04:53:00.000Z	arooni-mobile	Shishire	does it change anything if im running ubuntu 8.04 LTS and not ubuntu ibex?  (i had version # wrong)
2009-04-07T04:54:00.000Z	Shishire	arooni-mobile	no
2009-04-07T04:54:00.000Z	arooni-mobile	Shishire	huh?
2009-04-07T04:54:00.000Z	Shishire	arooni-mobile	it makes no difference between 8.10 and 8.04
2009-04-07T04:55:00.000Z	arooni-mobile	Shishire	ok so the only command i type is: sudo fsck /dev/sda1
2009-04-07T04:57:00.000Z	arooni-mobile	Shishire	so i booted into recovery mode;   now all i type is sudo fsck /dev/sda1 ?
2009-04-07T04:57:00.000Z	Shishire	arooni-mobile	if you're using recovery mode, and you're using the root terminal, you don't need the sudo, but yes
2009-04-07T04:59:00.000Z	Shishire	arooni-mobile	use -y.  but be careful. that tells it to auto-answer yes to ALL questions
2009-04-07T04:59:00.000Z	arooni-mobile	Shishire	so that's not recommended?
2009-04-07T05:01:00.000Z	Shishire	arooni-mobile	if the computer is turned off while its still being used, it can corrupt the hard drive
