2008-09-04T20:34:00.000Z	draginxx		Does anyone know how to get a USB mouse working on Ubuntu? My Microsoft 1020 USB mouse isn't working at all on my laptop :(
2008-09-04T20:34:00.000Z	Gnea	draginxx	i usually just plug it in and they start working right away
2008-09-04T20:35:00.000Z	draginxx	Gnea	yeah thats what people say, but that isnt the case with me :(
2008-09-04T20:36:00.000Z	Gnea	draginxx	is this the only usb mouse you've tried?
2008-09-04T20:36:00.000Z	Gnea	draginxx	do you have any other usb devices to plug into it?
2008-09-04T20:37:00.000Z	draginxx	Gnea	my USB ext HD works fine
2008-09-04T20:37:00.000Z	draginxx	Gnea	yeah this is the only mouse Ive tried
2008-09-04T20:38:00.000Z	Gnea	draginxx	is it a laser mouse? does it work on any other computer?
2008-09-04T20:40:00.000Z	draginxx	Gnea	it has worked on a window computer, and its optical so yes :)
2008-09-04T20:40:00.000Z	Gnea	draginxx	and do you get any messages in syslog when you plug it in?
2008-09-04T20:42:00.000Z	draginxx	Gnea	howmay I view this?
2008-09-04T20:42:00.000Z	Gnea	draginxx	open a terminal and type:  tail -f /var/log/syslog   while you're doing that, unplug/plug the mouse in and wait a few seconds
