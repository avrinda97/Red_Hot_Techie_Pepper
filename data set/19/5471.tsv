2008-06-24T06:23:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Colin1	what program did you download a tarfile for?
2008-06-24T06:23:00.000Z	Colin1	IndyGunFreak	TerminatorX.  I'm trying to be able to run more then 1 instance of music
2008-06-24T06:23:00.000Z	Colin1	IndyGunFreak	Some guy said I should try that program.
2008-06-24T06:24:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Colin1	that program is in the repositories, no need compile it from source.
2008-06-24T06:24:00.000Z	Colin1	IndyGunFreak	Sooo... from that synaw/e thing?
2008-06-24T06:24:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Colin1	System/Admin/Synaptic Package Manager.. do a search for Terminator, right click, mark for install, then apply, apply
2008-06-24T06:32:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Colin1	you mean like play two mp3's at the same time?
2008-06-24T06:33:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Colin1	thats a pulse-audio bug.. if you switch all your programs to ALSA, and your main sound to Alsa, it will probably work.
2008-06-24T06:35:00.000Z	Colin1	IndyGunFreak	Just tried it, still won't work.
2008-06-24T06:35:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Colin1	what program are you playing your mp3's in?
2008-06-24T06:35:00.000Z	Colin1	IndyGunFreak	I tried loading one MP3 in Movie player, and one in MPlayer
2008-06-24T06:38:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Colin1	i don't know, can't really explain that one.
2008-06-24T06:38:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Colin1	are you getting errors, or is it just only playing one of them?
2008-06-24T06:40:00.000Z	Colin1	IndyGunFreak	It plays one, and errors the other
2008-06-24T06:41:00.000Z	Colin1	IndyGunFreak	Well, actually, only Mplayer gets the error.
2008-06-24T06:41:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Colin1	i'm not really sure to be truthful.. i don't use mplayer..
2008-06-24T06:41:00.000Z	Colin1	IndyGunFreak	So I spose this would be forum material then?
2008-06-24T06:42:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Colin1	yeah, i guess so, ..
2008-06-24T06:42:00.000Z	Colin1	IndyGunFreak	Well, thanks for the help.
