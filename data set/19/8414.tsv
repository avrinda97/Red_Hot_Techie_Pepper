2007-07-24T10:35:00.000Z	jen		hi guys... i have this weird network problem. when i use the live cd networking works fine, but when i try to install a command line system from the alternate cd i get a message dhcp doesn't work. any ideas? i'm sure there is no irq conflict or so...
2007-07-24T10:35:00.000Z	v3ctor	jen	do you have multiple interfaces?
2007-07-24T10:36:00.000Z	jen	v3ctor	at first when i tried i had a wifi card installed, but i removed it and the problem still persists... using only one eth now. (the one on the mainboard)
2007-07-24T10:39:00.000Z	v3ctor	jen	have you tried skipping the network config and just installing it?
2007-07-24T10:40:00.000Z	jen	v3ctor	no. but wouldn't that just end up with me having a system without network? dunno what to do once it's installed really.
2007-07-24T10:41:00.000Z	v3ctor	jen	could be that the install cd isn't loading you NIC module
2007-07-24T10:43:00.000Z	jen	v3ctor	genii: it's an "marvell 88e8001". i'll see if i can find anything on that model
2007-07-24T10:50:00.000Z	jen	v3ctor	genii: no, i couldn't find anything. :( but thanks a lot for the input
2007-07-24T10:52:00.000Z	v3ctor	jen	you could boot the livecd and find out what module it uses, then try to load that module when you boot the install cd
2007-07-24T10:52:00.000Z	jen	v3ctor	oh. how?
2007-07-24T10:53:00.000Z	jen	v3ctor	i'm on the live cd now so i could try right away
2007-07-24T10:53:00.000Z	v3ctor	jen	see if google can show you what module it uses, or lsmod from the livecd... once you find it do `modload <module name>` on the install cd
2007-07-24T10:54:00.000Z	v3ctor	jen	do lsmod and paste the output to http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org
2007-07-24T10:54:00.000Z	jen	v3ctor	just add that after the other boot parameters?
2007-07-24T10:54:00.000Z	v3ctor	jen	that or you can alt+f2 to get login on the install cd
2007-07-24T10:55:00.000Z	jen	v3ctor	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31122/
2007-07-24T10:58:00.000Z	v3ctor	jen	google says it is  sk98lin
2007-07-24T10:58:00.000Z	v3ctor	jen	google says it is  sk98lin
2007-07-24T11:01:00.000Z	jen	v3ctor	ah! thank you SO much. gonna try it now and hope for the best.
