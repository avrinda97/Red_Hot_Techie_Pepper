2011-03-19T06:06:00.000Z	sn00pdigg		my terminal is having a hard time finding adb shell
2011-03-19T06:06:00.000Z	sn00pdigg		bash won't recognize the command
2011-03-19T06:07:00.000Z	sn00pdigg		tried adding it to basrc and it doesn't seem to work even after a source...
2011-03-19T06:07:00.000Z	coz_	sn00pdigg	  maybe here   http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=522827
2011-03-19T06:08:00.000Z	coz_	sn00pdigg	   google with this search string    ubuntu adb shell
2011-03-19T06:12:00.000Z	coz_	sn00pdigg	  darn ok then you might want to go to the ##linux channel to see if someone there may have more suggestions
2011-03-19T06:12:00.000Z	coz_	sn00pdigg	 that was just to change permissions
2011-03-19T06:13:00.000Z	coz_	sn00pdigg	 there would be no readout after that command
2011-03-19T06:13:00.000Z	coz_	sn00pdigg	  ah ok...then again I suggest  ##linux channel
2011-03-19T06:14:00.000Z	coz_	sn00pdigg	  I believe so but not sure  ,, I would still google to find anything that talks about installing or accessing on ubuntu
2011-03-19T06:15:00.000Z	coz_	sn00pdigg	  probably not if it didnt install
2011-03-19T06:18:00.000Z	coz_	sn00pdigg	 do you have an android device connected?
2011-03-19T06:18:00.000Z	coz_	sn00pdigg	 then I am puzzled ,, honestly I have no experience with this at all
2011-03-19T06:19:00.000Z	coz_	sn00pdigg	 did you c heck in ##linux?
2011-03-19T06:19:00.000Z	coz_	sn00pdigg	 is you nick name registered?
2011-03-19T06:20:00.000Z	coz_	sn00pdigg	 that's probably why
2011-03-19T06:20:00.000Z	coz_	sn00pdigg	  register you nick and it should work
2011-03-19T06:20:00.000Z	coz_	sn00pdigg	  where you type here type  /msg nicserv register help
2011-03-19T06:20:00.000Z	coz_	sn00pdigg	 ok  good luck on this
