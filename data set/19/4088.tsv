2009-04-03T22:33:00.000Z	nyaa		hey =)  is there a way to set an application as a higher priority so that it runs faster?
2009-04-03T22:34:00.000Z	grawity	nyaa	Find out the application's PID (using 'ps'), then use: sudo renice <change> <pid>
2009-04-03T22:49:00.000Z	grawity	nyaa	Maybe %SystemRoot%\inf (usually C:\WINDOWS\inf)

2009-07-18T19:08:00.000Z	grawity	nyaa	If the hardware supports PAE, it can access all RAM you have - and most 32-bit OSes of today support that too.
2009-07-18T19:09:00.000Z	nyaa	grawity	I'd find pae or not in the bios right?
2009-07-18T19:09:00.000Z	grawity	nyaa	I doubt it
2009-07-18T19:10:00.000Z	nyaa	grawity	never that simple heh, I'll look it up later then so I can add the extra  gig of ram that I won't even manage to use as cache =)
2009-07-18T19:10:00.000Z	grawity	nyaa	It might be in the output of dmesg
2009-07-18T19:12:00.000Z	nyaa	grawity	pae doesn't show up at all when I grep it, and address doesn't show anything that makes sense, so I guess its a no go for me =)
2009-07-18T19:13:00.000Z	grawity	nyaa	grep -i 'physical address extension'
2009-07-18T19:13:00.000Z	nyaa	grawity	nothing at all for that one
2009-07-18T19:16:00.000Z	nyaa	grawity	I found a better way, grep flags /proc/cpuinfo shows a pae flag
2009-07-18T19:16:00.000Z	grawity	nyaa	And is it on?
2009-07-18T19:16:00.000Z	grawity	nyaa	Ah, wait. D'oh
2009-07-18T19:17:00.000Z	nyaa	grawity	lol yeah its just a flag, I'm seeing if there's anything more indicative though in there
2009-07-18T19:17:00.000Z	nyaa	grawity	but I guess it means it has to support it
2009-07-18T20:53:00.000Z	grawity	nyaa	A gateway is a single computer in that network.
2009-07-18T20:54:00.000Z	nyaa	grawity	so when you are assigning them, how do you give an ip address to a network?  192.168.1.255?
