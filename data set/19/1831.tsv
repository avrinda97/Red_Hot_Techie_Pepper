2010-09-26T06:26:00.000Z	mamece2		would you personally recommend ubuntu over windows vista?
2010-09-26T06:26:00.000Z	edbian	mamece2	yes!  But why ask that in an Ubuntu channel ? :)
2010-09-26T06:27:00.000Z	edbian	mamece2	Basically not an issue for linux.  It is designed differently and is therefore more secure.  Plus it has the added bonus of being a portion small market share and therefore a lousy target for attackers.
2010-09-26T06:28:00.000Z	edbian	mamece2	No worries.  Completely valid question
2010-09-26T06:29:00.000Z	edbian	mamece2	Linux is not childish.
2010-09-27T05:51:00.000Z	edbian	mamece2	not a problem.  Just an annoyance
2010-09-27T05:51:00.000Z	edbian	mamece2	figure the exact number of the old kernel and remove it's package using synaptic.
2010-09-27T05:51:00.000Z	edbian	mamece2	Although some people leave the old kernels there in case something breaks and you need to fall back to it
2010-09-27T05:52:00.000Z	mamece2	edbian	that what i though, if the new one breaks... how can i know the new one is rotten? i wouldnt even boot , amirite?
2010-09-27T05:52:00.000Z	edbian	mamece2	Yeah.
2010-09-27T05:53:00.000Z	edbian	mamece2	If the new one was "bad" in a way that mattered you would notice.  If you didn't notice then it wouldn't matter.  See my point?
2010-09-27T05:53:00.000Z	mamece2	edbian	ok fine, i feel like am leavin noobness
2010-10-06T07:15:00.000Z	edbian	mamece2	Ubuntu is based on Debian testing.  Debian also has "stable and sid" which are older and newer packages respectively
2010-10-06T07:16:00.000Z	edbian	mamece2	Ubuntu also has some custom changes (programs and themes and such)
2010-10-06T07:18:00.000Z	edbian	mamece2	Pretty much.
2010-10-06T07:18:00.000Z	mamece2	edbian	ok, hey ive got an issue with fullscreen youtube videos, sometimes i see a black flash
2010-10-06T07:19:00.000Z	edbian	mamece2	It's just because flash for linux is poorly written.  Everyone has performance problems.
2010-10-06T07:19:00.000Z	mamece2	edbian	ok , i though i should reinstall the package
2010-10-06T07:20:00.000Z	edbian	mamece2	worth a shot since it's so simple and easy
