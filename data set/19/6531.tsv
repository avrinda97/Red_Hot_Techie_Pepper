2008-06-14T01:08:00.000Z	Elda		I am curious.... anyone know offhand how it may be possible (or is it even possible) to make it so that Winblows and Ubuntu share a common hard drive for the installation of programs, file storing, etc?
2008-06-14T01:09:00.000Z	Elda		I understand that... but what partition format would they both agree upon?>
2008-06-14T01:09:00.000Z	Elda		Okay
2008-06-14T01:10:00.000Z	Elda		I will probably do that, as right now I have them both separated.  Have Vista on one with half of it devoted to that, and half of it devoted to Ubuntu
2008-06-14T01:10:00.000Z	Elda		No no no.... I want to do this on ONE hd
2008-06-14T01:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Elda	format it fat32 and mount or format ntfs and mount using ntfs-3g
2008-06-14T01:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Elda	share it with samba, then map it as a network drive from windows
2008-06-14T01:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Elda	oh, i thought it was over LAN.
2008-06-14T01:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Elda	indeed, ntfs-3g or fat32 for the common area
2008-06-14T01:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Elda	yeah if its mounted with ntfs-3g, no worries
2009-02-16T19:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Elda	sudo rmmod pcspkr
2009-02-16T19:46:00.000Z	Elda	ActionParsnip	thank you!
2009-02-16T19:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Elda	if you blacklist the module too it will never come back
2009-02-16T19:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Elda	sudo echo "blacklist pcspkr" >> /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist
2009-02-16T19:50:00.000Z	Elda	ActionParsnip	so in typing sudo echo "blacklist pcspkr" will add that to my file without having to open it up in gedit and add it myself Im guessing?
2009-02-16T19:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Elda	yeah echo >> adds the line to the end of the file
2009-02-16T19:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Elda	same kinda deal
2009-02-16T19:51:00.000Z	Elda	ActionParsnip	that is nice.  Thank you again :D
2009-02-16T19:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Elda	there a weird and wonderful thing for BC43xx cards
