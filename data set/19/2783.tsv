2010-03-03T05:22:00.000Z	mylisto2		does virtualbox automatically install to the "virtual harddrive" you have assigned to the machine?
2010-03-03T05:24:00.000Z	mylisto2		ok goviel: I was just worried about messing up something by installing xp - wasn't aware if vbox automatically installed it to the "assigned" "fake" hd
2010-03-03T05:26:00.000Z	mylisto2		ok cool
2010-03-03T05:26:00.000Z	mylisto2		how big should the hd be for xp corp goviel:?
2010-03-03T05:28:00.000Z	mylisto2		ok cool
2010-03-03T05:28:00.000Z	mylisto2		I picked 10gigs for now
2010-03-03T05:29:00.000Z	mylisto2		what are the limitations of running windows os's in virtual box?  Are somethings not working yet?
2010-03-03T05:31:00.000Z	mylisto2		nice
2010-03-03T05:31:00.000Z	mylisto2		seems like a better option that dual booting, is it?
2010-03-03T05:32:00.000Z	mylisto2		backtrack?
2010-03-03T05:33:00.000Z	Losha	mylisto2	for casual use it's very good. But there are some things you can't do from an emulator, i.e. access special hardware. It's also a tad slower. But there's nothing like it if you want to run multiple different distros
2010-03-03T05:34:00.000Z	mylisto2	Losha	what kind of special hardware are you talking about?
2010-03-03T05:35:00.000Z	Losha	mylisto2	well, anything that's a pci card, for example...
2010-03-03T05:35:00.000Z	mylisto2	Losha	is it possible they will support that in the future?
2010-03-03T05:36:00.000Z	Losha	mylisto2	probably not. There's a lot of hardware out there. How to choose what to support?
2010-03-03T05:36:00.000Z	mylisto2		true
2010-03-03T05:36:00.000Z	Losha	mylisto2	is there some hardware you have that you need to support?
2010-03-03T05:36:00.000Z	mylisto2		nah not really...
2010-03-03T05:37:00.000Z	Losha	mylisto2	don't worry about it then...
