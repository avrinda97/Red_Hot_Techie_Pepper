2008-10-22T04:51:00.000Z	soundray	smart	what makes you think you need to update your drivers?
2008-10-22T04:53:00.000Z	soundray	smart	what do you mean by 'I can't open...'?
2008-10-22T04:55:00.000Z	soundray	smart	did you run winecfg?
2008-10-22T04:58:00.000Z	soundray	smart	you don't need new drivers. Run winecfg and configure your graphics appropriately for running games under wine
2008-10-22T05:00:00.000Z	soundray	smart	did you get a Linux client for Second Life?
2008-10-22T05:01:00.000Z	soundray	smart	hold  on
2008-10-22T05:02:00.000Z	soundray	smart	I thought Second Life was a Windows app. If not, then the winecfg advice doesn't apply (thanks Pici)
2008-10-22T05:03:00.000Z	soundray	smart	what framerates do you get when you run glxgears?
2008-10-22T05:03:00.000Z	soundray	smart	what framerates do you get when you run glxgears?
2008-10-22T05:05:00.000Z	soundray	smart	so run glxgears and find out
2008-10-22T05:06:00.000Z	soundray	smart	it is a program. Open a terminal and type glxgears
2008-10-22T05:08:00.000Z	soundray	smart	interrupt this with Ctrl-C
2008-10-22T05:11:00.000Z	smart	soundray	??
2008-10-22T05:11:00.000Z	soundray	smart	your graphics are perfectly capable. I don't know why Second Life won't run. I suggest you contact Linden Labs and ask them about the problem.
2008-10-22T05:11:00.000Z	soundray	smart	patience!
