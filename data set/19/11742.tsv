2006-03-27T07:20:00.000Z	ciplogic		I found the solution! - for who is interested: edit the file /etc/apt.conf and add the lines:
2006-03-27T07:20:00.000Z	ciplogic		Acquire "";
2006-03-27T07:20:00.000Z	ciplogic		Acquire::http "";
2006-03-27T07:20:00.000Z	ciplogic		Acquire::http::timeout "10";
2006-03-27T07:20:00.000Z	ciplogic		Acquire::ftp "";
2006-03-27T07:20:00.000Z	ciplogic		Acquire::ftp::timeout "10";
2006-03-27T07:21:00.000Z	ciplogic		that will remove the other sources than local ones
