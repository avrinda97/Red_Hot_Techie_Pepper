2010-02-10T05:44:00.000Z	anon	Jordan_U	 yes
2010-02-10T05:43:00.000Z	Jordan_U	anon	Did you use the standard Ubuntu installer to install to the external drive?
2010-02-10T05:46:00.000Z	Jordan_U	anon	Is the external drive larger or smaller than the internal?
2010-02-10T05:46:00.000Z	anon	Jordan_U	 smaller...40g external 160g internal.
2010-02-10T05:48:00.000Z	Jordan_U	anon	I would boot into an Ubuntu LiveCD, use gparted to copy your Ubuntu partition to your internal drive, then re-install grub following these instructions: http://grub.enbug.org/Grub2LiveCdInstallGuide
2010-02-10T05:49:00.000Z	Jordan_U	anon	Assuming that you don't have too much data on the external drive's filesystem for gparted to resize it to fit in the internal.
2010-02-10T05:49:00.000Z	anon	Jordan_U	 ill check it out. im a linux newby but windows sucks so i wanna dump it and move to linux
2010-02-10T05:50:00.000Z	anon	Jordan_U	 i still have 27g left on a 40g drive and like 6g are movies
2010-02-10T05:53:00.000Z	anon	Jordan_U	 i may just restart from scratch..i reallly dont have much on here and it may be easier. was just kinda wanting to migrate for the knowledge purposes
2010-02-10T05:54:00.000Z	Jordan_U	anon	The Ubuntu installer also has a migration assistant, it won't get installed apps and such but it should grab settings and documents IIRC
2010-02-10T05:55:00.000Z	anon	Jordan_U	ill probably just use that then. thanks man.
2010-02-10T05:55:00.000Z	Jordan_U	anon	np
2010-02-10T05:55:00.000Z	anon	Jordan_U	if i use the migration assistant and AptonCD i should be able to get all it over right?
2012-07-10T21:23:00.000Z	Jordan_U	anon	I assume you mean "sudo apt-get remove mplayer"? And can you please pastebin the complete output of that command?
2012-07-10T21:23:00.000Z	Jordan_U	anon	Can you reproduce the problem with plain apt-get?
2012-07-10T21:25:00.000Z	anon	Jordan_U	http://pastebin.com/TY3sp2en
2012-07-10T21:28:00.000Z	Jordan_U	anon	I assume that there is another package which depends on mplayer or mplayer2. What output do you get if you run "sudo apt-get remove mplayer mplayer2"?
2012-07-10T21:30:00.000Z	anon	Jordan_U	It doesn't list any dependency and removes everything, thanks.
2012-07-10T21:30:00.000Z	Jordan_U	anon	You're welcome.
