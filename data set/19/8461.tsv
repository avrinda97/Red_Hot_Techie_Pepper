2007-04-02T05:15:00.000Z	nickk		is it possible to run an application from a script?
2007-04-02T05:15:00.000Z	bruenig	nickk	yes
2007-04-02T05:15:00.000Z	nickk	bruenig	how would I go about it?
2007-04-02T05:15:00.000Z	bruenig	nickk	what are you trying to do
2007-04-02T05:16:00.000Z	nickk	bruenig	well.. my beryl loads slower than kiba dock.. so kiba dock loads without transparency all ugly.. so i thought.. maybe write a script to load xcompmgr first.. load kiba dock.. then beryl.. then close xcompmgr... but maybe there is a better solution heh
2007-04-02T05:16:00.000Z	bruenig	nickk	yeah you can do that just create a script and put those commands in that order
2007-04-02T05:17:00.000Z	nickk	bruenig	okay.. so i can just run the command straight...? no exec () or something like that?
2007-04-02T05:17:00.000Z	bruenig	nickk	right, just list the commands
2007-04-02T05:18:00.000Z	nickk	bruenig	okay thanks a lot... one last question.. whats the command to completely terminate a process... say if i load xcompmgr.. and then i need to kill it..  which command would i use?
2007-04-02T05:18:00.000Z	bruenig	nickk	something like this http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/13454/
2007-04-02T05:19:00.000Z	bruenig	nickk	not sure on the kiba and beryl commands, but you get the idea
2007-04-02T05:19:00.000Z	nickk	bruenig	Jawshie, thank you :)
2007-04-02T05:25:00.000Z	nickk	bruenig	i added the code to run the commands in /etc/rc.local but nothing worked... any ideas?
2007-04-02T05:26:00.000Z	bruenig	nickk	it should be run from startup programs, in system>preferences>sessions
2007-04-02T05:26:00.000Z	nickk	bruenig	meaning i should run rc.local from there?
2007-04-02T05:26:00.000Z	bruenig	nickk	meaning you should run that script from there
2007-04-02T05:27:00.000Z	bruenig	nickk	rc.local should not be used at all
2007-04-02T05:27:00.000Z	nickk	bruenig	okay i'll try that thanks
2007-04-02T05:27:00.000Z	bruenig	nickk	you may wish to try #ubuntu-effects for beryl advice
