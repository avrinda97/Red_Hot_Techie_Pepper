2008-11-11T00:20:00.000Z	giacomo_c1		so 8.10 killed my gnome... how do i get it to work again?  it just gives me a black screen but still shows the pointer
2008-11-11T00:22:00.000Z	giacomo_c1		can anyone help me fix an 8.10 upgrade problem that gives me a black screen instead of gnome?\
2008-11-11T00:24:00.000Z	giacomo_c1		oh no!  nothing gnome works!  not even gnome-terminal!
2008-11-11T00:25:00.000Z	giacomo_c1		:argh: ubuntu!  how are you going to wave this fance release infront of me then ruin everything!
2008-11-11T00:25:00.000Z	giacomo_c1		how do i downgrade to the 8.04... that works
2008-11-11T00:26:00.000Z	unr3a1	giacomo_c1	why would you want to?
2008-11-11T00:26:00.000Z	giacomo_c1	unr3a1	because 8.10 destroyed everything gnome related
2008-11-11T00:26:00.000Z	unr3a1	giacomo_c1	I am sorry
2008-11-11T00:26:00.000Z	giacomo_c1	unr3a1	i blame this on you, it is your fault!
2008-11-11T00:27:00.000Z	unr3a1	giacomo_c1	 lol.  ofcourse you do :P
2008-11-11T00:29:00.000Z	unr3a1	giacomo_c1	 do you know how it happened?  and what is exactly happening with your gnome?
2008-11-11T00:31:00.000Z	unr3a1	giacomo_c1	 that's really weird.  did you do an upgrade, or fresh install?
2008-11-11T00:32:00.000Z	giacomo_c1	unr3a1	upgrade... and it was working earlier too!  but i rebooted and now gnome doesn't work... i mean, fluxbox (what im currently using) works fine, but gnome is shot
2008-11-11T00:33:00.000Z	unr3a1	giacomo_c1	 you could try a fresh install.
2008-11-11T00:33:00.000Z	giacomo_c1	unr3a1	i know i could, but if im going to be fresh installing anything, it will be debian because ubuntu has betrayed me one too many times
2008-11-11T00:34:00.000Z	unr3a1	giacomo_c1	 well you can't give up now!!
2008-11-11T00:34:00.000Z	giacomo_c1	unr3a1	hahaha
2008-11-11T00:36:00.000Z	unr3a1	giacomo_c1	 well you can't.  sudo dpkg --set-selections < my-packages and reinstall ubuntu fresh
2008-11-11T00:39:00.000Z	giacomo_c1	unr3a1	what was that?
