2010-06-24T22:16:00.000Z	oldIT78		ha. JackLinux, i just found your forum post. heh.
2010-06-24T22:17:00.000Z	oldIT78		Can anyone tell me how to uninstall all the KDE packages that come along with Amarok? I have uninstalled Amarok. OS ubuntu 10.04 Gnome desktop.
2010-06-24T22:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	oldIT78	sudo apt-get install amarok ,will install all the extra kde fluff it needs. Why not use banshee. Its gnome based and will use less extra packages
2010-06-24T22:19:00.000Z	oldIT78	ActionParsnip	... i think you may missunderstand ... i want to UNINSTALL the meta packages that Amarok installs. i have already uninstalled amarok.
2010-06-24T22:24:00.000Z	oldIT78	ActionParsnip	I saw the website for the command to go pure gnome. ... it just worries me. that should leave all gnome packages and get rid of all the kde packages that Amarok installed?
2010-06-24T22:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	oldIT78	yeah just removes the kde packages
2010-06-24T22:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	oldIT78	autoremove will remove orphaned packages which are no longer needed
2010-06-24T22:27:00.000Z	oldIT78	ActionParsnip	ok. I ran the command. when i restart will it remove, all these K processes in my system monitor? like Kacpid, kblockd/0, khelper, khungtaskd. etc etc?
2010-06-24T22:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	oldIT78	should do yes
2010-06-24T23:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	oldIT78	I know compiz can do it but you forfiet desktop icons. Kde can do stuff gnome can't and viseversa, they are different softwares
2010-06-24T23:07:00.000Z	oldIT78	ActionParsnip	yeah, i kinda like my desktop icons. i know the community is working on it. it just seems odd that it never has been implemented fully ... keeping your desktop icons. Oh and n3m3s1s4u is right. you are a winnner.
2010-06-24T23:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	oldIT78	submit it on http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com or use kde
2010-06-24T23:08:00.000Z	oldIT78	ActionParsnip	already been submitted a zillion times. no implementation yet.
