2011-10-05T05:08:00.000Z	Shatters		lol that's what I did the last time I installed cuttlefish, but when I was in here last night it sounded way complicated to use the second partition (logical) to install new programs.
2011-10-05T05:09:00.000Z	Shatters		and after all the updates required when installing ub. 10 luc. it leaves me with about 2 gig space for more programs.
2011-10-05T05:10:00.000Z	Shatters		it's very bad when the updates are taking up 50% of the expected system space
2011-10-05T05:10:00.000Z	Shatters		hmm not sure about symlinks. gotta google it. I've only used Ubuntu for a few days now.
2011-10-05T05:12:00.000Z	Shatters		yeah I was using bleachbit for that soreau
2011-10-05T05:12:00.000Z	Shatters		hmm, last person I asked about installations said that they go to usr/bin or bins but how do I know after installing a package what files go where because frankly the bin folder just looks like a mess
2011-10-05T05:13:00.000Z	Shatters		and I can't tell what files are associated with what apps, they seem mixed up.
2011-10-05T05:13:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	Shatters	/usr/bin is a common directory for program binaries, but it is not the only place they are put
2011-10-05T05:14:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	Shatters	and many times it is up to you where they go
2011-10-05T05:14:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	Shatters	either search, or just find out from wherever you got the software
2011-10-05T05:15:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	Shatters	use locate
2011-10-05T05:19:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	Shatters	as long as that location is in your path
2011-10-05T05:20:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	Shatters	it could be on a network drive, external, whatever, as long as that drive is mounted, and the location is on your path
2011-10-05T05:20:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	Shatters	if the location is not on your path you would need to use the canonical name to launch it
2011-10-05T05:21:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	Shatters	literally your path
2011-10-05T05:21:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	Shatters	you can see what is on it by typing echo $PATH at command line
2011-10-05T20:50:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	Shatters	hey sorry, this isnt really help, just curious how you set up an account without a password in the first place. I wasnt aware you could even do that
2011-10-05T20:52:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	Shatters	follow ActionParsnip advice and see what happens. If that doesn't work try typing just passwd at the terminal as the account you are trying to update
2011-10-05T20:54:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	Shatters	i think it will indeed make you login, unless ubuntu also has a auto login that I am unaware of too
