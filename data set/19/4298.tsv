2009-05-10T02:15:00.000Z	ubuntistas		yeah chuck_
2009-05-10T02:17:00.000Z	chuck_	ubuntistas	You can remove it then reinstall
2009-05-10T02:15:00.000Z	chuck_	ubuntistas	Did you download boxee from apt
2009-05-10T02:17:00.000Z	ubuntistas	chuck_	i did that
2009-05-10T02:19:00.000Z	chuck_	ubuntistas	No you said you deleted some files did you run sudo apt-get purge boxee
2009-05-10T02:22:00.000Z	chuck_	ubuntistas	and when you try to reinstall it what error msg. do you get
2009-05-10T02:28:00.000Z	chuck_	ubuntistas	It looks like a permission issue did you try running it as root to create the files
2009-05-10T02:31:00.000Z	chuck_	ubuntistas	in a terminal window type sudo boxee if it works close it and try opening it as normal user
2009-05-10T02:35:00.000Z	ubuntistas	chuck_	not working
2009-05-10T02:36:00.000Z	chuck_	ubuntistas	check on the boxee forum and see if someone will send you the default  .xml file I got rid of boxee so I do not have it.
