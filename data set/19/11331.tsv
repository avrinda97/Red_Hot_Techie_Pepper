2006-02-21T12:16:00.000Z	axiom		so qt was installed to /usr/lib, but the configure i'm running expects qt to be in /lib, any ideas where to go from here? is there a way to duplicate the install to /lib?

2006-02-21T12:17:00.000Z	axiom		i didn't find it in apt, nor a replacement that i knew of
2006-02-21T12:18:00.000Z	topyli	axiom	you can usually tell the config scripts where libraries are. try .configure --help
2006-02-21T12:18:00.000Z	axiom	topyli	thanks, giving that s hot
2006-02-21T12:19:00.000Z	topyli	axiom	since you're compiling against qt, are you sure you have the -dev packages?
2006-02-21T12:20:00.000Z	axiom	topyli	i was asking about that earlier, i have libqt3-mt-dev
2006-02-21T12:21:00.000Z	topyli	axiom	ok then, maybe the config script is confused
2006-02-21T12:21:00.000Z	axiom	topyli	among others. i also changed the library setting on the config, and it found it, but now its complaining about other things with qt
2006-02-21T12:23:00.000Z	topyli	axiom	maybe you need to pass --prefix=/usr to the script and it will look for everything in the right place
2006-02-21T12:24:00.000Z	axiom	topyli	yea, the option this script uses is --with-Qt-dir=, however its complaining now about a missing file, bnv_qt_test.c to be exact
2006-02-21T12:24:00.000Z	axiom	topyli	so i'm on a google hunt for it currently
2006-02-21T12:28:00.000Z	axiom	topyli	apparently they made a ubuntu package already >:O curse my inferior google skills
2006-02-21T12:29:00.000Z	topyli	axiom	usually there is an ubuntu package that has what you need. almost all free software is in ubuntu/debian
2006-02-21T12:30:00.000Z	axiom	topyli	yea, the problem is its not in the main repositories
2006-02-21T12:30:00.000Z	topyli	axiom	sometimes
2006-02-21T12:31:00.000Z	axiom	topyli	well, by main i mean its not in any of the official repositories, so i have to install an unverifiable package, which i dislike having to do. whatever though, i can read my comics now
2006-02-21T12:31:00.000Z	axiom	topyli	(second week using ubuntu, things are still rather new to me)
2006-02-21T12:33:00.000Z	topyli	axiom	if apt doesn't know about the provider of the package, it will complain. it's just a heads-up
