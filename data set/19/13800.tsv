2011-10-20T13:25:00.000Z	applesouce		I've bought a Notebook and wanted to ask what partitions I should use
2011-10-20T13:25:00.000Z	applesouce		I have 320 GB HDD and want to have Ubuntu and Windows
2011-10-20T13:25:00.000Z	reisio	applesouce	half and half?
2011-10-20T13:26:00.000Z	reisio	applesouce	if you're going to use Windows for big games, you might give it a little more <shrug>
2011-10-20T13:26:00.000Z	reisio	applesouce	it's plenty for each OS and plenty of 3rd party software for each
2011-10-20T13:26:00.000Z	reisio	applesouce	okay then you won't need to give Windows more
2011-10-20T13:27:00.000Z	reisio	applesouce	you can store ordinary files on either partition and copy to and from, so it's just a matter of program files
2011-10-20T13:27:00.000Z	reisio	applesouce	hrmm?
2011-10-20T13:28:00.000Z	reisio	applesouce	make two partitions, let Windows' installer format the first as NTFS, let Ubuntu's installer format the second as whatever you like
2011-10-20T13:29:00.000Z	reisio	applesouce	I think it uses ext4 by default, which is okay
2011-10-20T13:29:00.000Z	reisio	applesouce	you might want to leave space for a third partition for Ubuntu's swap, equal to the amount of RAM
2011-10-20T13:29:00.000Z	reisio	applesouce	unless you have less than a gig of RAM, then possibly twice the size
2011-10-20T13:30:00.000Z	reisio	applesouce	I would, yes, particularly for a portable
2011-10-20T13:30:00.000Z	reisio	applesouce	it's utilized for suspend/hibernate, among other things
2011-10-20T13:30:00.000Z	reisio	applesouce	I'd go with 4GB, but you could just let the installer use whatever it likes
2011-10-20T13:31:00.000Z	reisio	applesouce	yes by default
2011-10-20T13:31:00.000Z	reisio	applesouce	you say where to install to, and what filesystem
2011-10-20T13:31:00.000Z	reisio	applesouce	unless you opt to use a more advanced configuration
