2007-02-13T06:21:00.000Z	ahave	erUSUL	the link you gave me doesnt seem to be quite what i am looking for...
2007-02-13T06:21:00.000Z	ahave	erUSUL	sound works with _some_ apps. but not all
2007-02-13T06:21:00.000Z	erUSUL	ahave	what apps do work?
2007-02-13T06:21:00.000Z	ahave	erUSUL	i tried a diff liveCD of diff distro and the sound works fine
2007-02-13T06:22:00.000Z	ahave	erUSUL	firefox works and i tried a few games and they worked also
2007-02-13T06:22:00.000Z	ahave	erUSUL	but xchat has no sounds and kismet has no sounds
2007-02-13T06:26:00.000Z	erUSUL	ahave	maybe kismet (being qt iirc needs arts running)
2007-02-13T06:27:00.000Z	ahave	erUSUL	what do you mean by qt iirc and arts?
2007-02-13T06:27:00.000Z	ahave	erUSUL	link me?
2007-02-13T06:27:00.000Z	erUSUL	ahave	arts is a sound server like esd some apps need one to be running kde uses arts and gnome esd
2007-02-13T06:28:00.000Z	ahave	erUSUL	ah
2007-02-13T06:28:00.000Z	ahave	erUSUL	can i load a KDE environment ontop/next to my ubuntu w/ gnome?
2007-02-13T06:29:00.000Z	ahave	erUSUL	or possibly switch to KDE without loosing all my settings
2007-02-13T06:29:00.000Z	erUSUL	ahave	not wise, maybe tyou can configure kismet to use alsa directly and all other apps that doesn't work
2007-02-13T06:30:00.000Z	ahave	erUSUL	what if i just switch to KDE? would that require a new install?
2007-02-13T06:31:00.000Z	erUSUL	ahave	no, install kubuntu-desktop but it seems like no worth the effort just for hearing kismet
2007-02-13T06:32:00.000Z	ahave	erUSUL	i agree. but i wouldnt mind seeing the difference in the two.
2007-02-13T06:32:00.000Z	erUSUL	ahave	as i said install kubuntu-desktop
2007-02-13T06:32:00.000Z	ahave	erUSUL	alright. thank you
