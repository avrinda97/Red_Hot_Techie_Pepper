2007-02-04T12:37:00.000Z	GMachine_24		Anyone use a good program to backup a computer with say 60GB of information across multiple DVDs without having to split a tar file into 2.5GB files. Yes, I basically want an idiot-proof program I can start, point it at all the data I want to back up and then insert a new DVD when required.
2007-02-04T12:39:00.000Z	GMachine_24		My past attempts to use 'upgrade' to move up to the latest Ubuntu release met with disaster.
2007-02-04T12:39:00.000Z	GMachine_24		Save your data, make a list of programs you want on your 'new' computer and install 6.1 fresh. That's what I did.
2007-02-04T12:40:00.000Z	GMachine_24		muysa: yes. many.
2007-02-04T12:41:00.000Z	GMachine_24		Am I allowed to post a link to a forum page in here for the CD burning question?
2007-02-04T12:41:00.000Z	ardchoille	GMachine_24	Others do and I don't see anything wrong with it
2007-02-04T12:43:00.000Z	ardchoille	GMachine_24	Did you write that article?
2007-02-04T12:54:00.000Z	ardchoille	GMachine_24	Everything I have learned about Linux I have learned from IRC and forums. Need some good links?
2007-02-04T12:55:00.000Z	GMachine_24	ardchoille	sure, I'm always willing to collect info sources. I'm just saying a lot of these questions are easily answered by a resource manual.
