2009-11-14T00:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	marks256	 i think ive seen teh mencoder faq with that anseer.. but it was to jpg. so  not sure if it can do tga directoy
2009-12-08T21:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	marks256	 download via ftp? ssh? http?
2009-12-08T21:36:00.000Z	marks256	Dr_Willis	all three
2009-12-12T22:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	marks256	 you mean DISPLAY=ip#:screen# ?
2009-12-12T23:01:00.000Z	marks256	Dr_Willis	yes that's what i mean. What can all be done with that? I guess i'm not sure what it is fully capable of
2009-12-12T23:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	marks256	 you can also do a line like -->    DISPLAY=hostname(orip):0   xterm &
2009-12-12T23:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	marks256	 that whould  start up an xterm on the remote box's dispolay
2009-12-12T23:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	marks256	 IF all the security stuff is set right
2009-12-12T23:02:00.000Z	marks256	Dr_Willis	ok. That much i did understand. But, say if one had an LTSP setup, could one user launch a window on another's terminal? (assuming security is all correct)
2009-12-12T23:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	marks256	 yes.  You could even try it from the console. and make it start a xterm on a X session
2009-12-12T23:04:00.000Z	marks256	Dr_Willis	neat! :) I have another hypothetical question then. Say if i already had xterm being displayed on my screen. Without terminating the application, could i send it to another host?
2009-12-12T23:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	marks256	 thats 'doable' with some nasty hacks  but not very easially or in a stable way.
2009-12-12T23:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	marks256	 if you need to be doing somthing like that a lot. use vncserver to launch a simple 'hidden' desktop you then access via a vncviewer.
2009-12-12T23:07:00.000Z	marks256	Dr_Willis	vnc eh? I've never really looked into that. It it fairly similar to LTSP?
2009-12-12T23:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	marks256	 it lets you run a desktop you can remotely access.   X has a 'similer' feature (xdmcp) but its not quite the same.
2009-12-12T23:08:00.000Z	marks256	Dr_Willis	so the client needs an OS on it? It can't do PXE boot
2009-12-12T23:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	marks256	 vncserver is a 'server' it runs on an OS. :)   its nothing to do with booting remote stuff.
2009-12-12T23:09:00.000Z	marks256	Dr_Willis	oh! duh :) i'm sorry. of course. Thanks for the help sir!
