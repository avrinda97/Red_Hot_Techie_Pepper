2006-06-14T11:12:00.000Z	Sir_Brizz		Loki wrote the original UT installer
2006-06-14T11:12:00.000Z	Sir_Brizz		and then Epic hired him
2006-06-14T11:12:00.000Z	Ademan	Sir_Brizz	ah, yeah i already installed ut2k4, quite painless :-)   but i didnt know if the original had the same, i assumed it didnt (becase of loki) so would you happen to know where i could find the install script?
2006-06-14T11:13:00.000Z	Sir_Brizz	Ademan	one sec

2006-06-14T11:16:00.000Z	Ademan	Sir_Brizz	while you're at it, do you happen to know where the linux patches are? same places?
2006-06-14T11:16:00.000Z	Sir_Brizz	Ademan	let me look
2006-06-14T11:19:00.000Z	Sir_Brizz	Ademan	I think those installers auto-patch the game...
2006-06-14T11:21:00.000Z	Sir_Brizz	Ademan	this also might be helpful
2006-06-14T11:22:00.000Z	Ademan	Sir_Brizz	so if i used the default installer from the ut2k4 cd then it "should" be up to date?
2006-06-14T11:22:00.000Z	Sir_Brizz	Ademan	for the original ut?
2006-06-14T11:22:00.000Z	Ademan	Sir_Brizz	thanks for the help too
