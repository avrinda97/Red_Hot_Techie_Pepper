2007-09-07T07:52:00.000Z	c01100011		shutdown windows incorrectly, ntfs drive isn't mounting, what is the command ... fix ntfs ?
2007-09-07T07:54:00.000Z	stefg	c01100011	be aware that ntfs-fix doe not actually fix anything (in the sense of chkdsk) it just resets the 'clean' bits so you can moutn again rw, but that can be risky
2007-11-04T23:28:00.000Z	stefg	c01100011	i think the drive is physically overwritten, so nothing to rescue. you could try testdisk, tho
2007-11-04T23:32:00.000Z	c01100011	stefg	use it to search for lost partitions ?
2007-11-04T23:33:00.000Z	stefg	c01100011	yes. but as i see it you have physically overwrtitten the partition table and any partition headers with data, so i don't think there's much hope
2007-11-04T23:34:00.000Z	c01100011	stefg	the drive was mounted at the time
2007-11-04T23:35:00.000Z	stefg	c01100011	see what testdisk and possibly photorec can do for you, but if you have no backup you may be in trouble
2007-11-04T23:36:00.000Z	stefg	c01100011	dd is one of the linux power commands that can do very good and very dangerous things
2007-11-04T23:52:00.000Z	c01100011	stefg	testdisk didn't find any partitions
2007-11-04T23:53:00.000Z	c01100011	stefg	 the image i copied was 512 mb,  so obviously the parition table is gone. but what about the rest of the data, is there anyway of getting it
2007-11-04T23:53:00.000Z	stefg	c01100011	i thought that. there is nothing to recover. it's overwritten
2007-11-04T23:53:00.000Z	stefg	c01100011	you could try photorec
2007-11-04T23:56:00.000Z	stefg	c01100011	http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/PhotoRec
2007-11-05T00:03:00.000Z	c01100011	stefg	 photorec is doing a great job of restoring all the files, but unfortunately that isn't what i need. See i have backups, but i don't remember what i had on this drive. [small portable drive full of music/movies/pictures that I took to school] Is there a way to recover the file names, and not the conent ?
2007-11-05T00:03:00.000Z	stefg	c01100011	not that i know of something
2007-11-05T00:06:00.000Z	c01100011	stefg	allright, guess I will live without files and replace them when i go home for fall break.
2007-11-05T00:07:00.000Z	c01100011	stefg	best way to fix the disk and turn it into on nice fat32 ?
2007-11-05T00:18:00.000Z	c01100011	stefg	gparted will only crete a  499.98 MB fat32 partition when i ask for a 465.76 GB one
2007-11-05T00:19:00.000Z	stefg	c01100011	cylinder boundaries...
