2005-02-18T14:57:00.000Z	blah09		i miss the ping that windows makes when you adjust the sound volume... =)
2005-02-18T14:57:00.000Z	blah09		it avoids you blowing your eardrums out if you have headphones...
2005-02-18T14:57:00.000Z	blah09		;)
2005-02-18T14:58:00.000Z	blah09		 is it possible to mount smb shares on boot?
2005-02-18T14:58:00.000Z	tritium	blah09	see ubuntuguide
2005-02-19T15:21:00.000Z	tritium	blah09	because of what I just described
2005-02-21T09:35:00.000Z	tritium	blah09	yes
2005-02-26T14:48:00.000Z	tritium	blah09	dmesg
2005-02-26T14:54:00.000Z	tritium	blah09	yes
2005-02-26T15:11:00.000Z	tritium	blah09	no, only laptop poops
2005-02-27T06:10:00.000Z	tritium	blah09	what are you trying to get help for?
2005-02-27T06:13:00.000Z	tritium	blah09	I'd advise against it right now
2005-02-27T06:14:00.000Z	tritium	blah09	yes
2005-02-27T06:14:00.000Z	tritium	blah09	it's surprising that ubuntu-desktop was made to depend on it already.  It appears to have not been tested.
2005-02-27T06:15:00.000Z	tritium	blah09	yes, but you reinstall esound.  It'll remove polypaudio and ubuntu-desktop, but that's not too critical
2005-02-27T06:17:00.000Z	tritium	blah09	it's just a meta-package that depends on a lot of other packages.
2005-02-27T06:17:00.000Z	tritium	blah09	but removing it doesn't remove all those things
2005-02-27T06:18:00.000Z	tritium	blah09	ok
2005-02-28T17:31:00.000Z	tritium	blah09	yes, but linux-image-686 doesn't depend on it yet because of what randabis is saying
