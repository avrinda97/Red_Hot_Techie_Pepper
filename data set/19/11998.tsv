2005-10-24T11:31:00.000Z	Peps		My network configuration (laptop) hangs for a long time at boot. My guess is it tries to activate eth0 (wireless) even thou it is disabled in /etc/network/interfaces. Can anyone help - it's very annoying
2005-10-24T11:31:00.000Z	Peps		and manually ifup it. I know - still very annoying
2005-10-24T11:32:00.000Z	ispiked	Peps	anything relevant in dmesg?
2005-10-24T11:34:00.000Z	ispiked	Peps	it's not wireless, is it?
2005-10-24T11:35:00.000Z	ispiked	Peps	and you're sure it's not just trying to find an access point?
2005-10-24T11:39:00.000Z	ispiked	Peps	what drivers are you using?
2005-10-24T11:40:00.000Z	Peps	ispiked	not sure - nothing in lsmo seem relevant
2005-10-24T11:40:00.000Z	ispiked	Peps	lspci?
2005-10-24T11:41:00.000Z	Peps	ispiked	probably this 0000:02:04.0 Network controller: Intel Corp.: Unknown device 4223 (rev 05)
2005-10-24T11:42:00.000Z	ispiked	Peps	you using ipw2*00?
2005-10-24T11:42:00.000Z	ispiked	Peps	lsmod |grep ipw
2005-10-24T11:42:00.000Z	ispiked	Peps	yeah, you're using ipw, then.
2005-10-24T11:43:00.000Z	Peps	ispiked	is that good or bad :)
2005-10-24T11:43:00.000Z	ispiked	Peps	neither. :)
2005-10-24T11:43:00.000Z	Peps	ispiked	but does it help?
2005-10-24T11:43:00.000Z	ispiked	Peps	well... I don't know if what you're seeing is really a bug or not.
2005-10-24T11:44:00.000Z	Peps	ispiked	I don't think the system should try to start eth0, if ny interfaces file says 'auto lo eth1'
2005-10-24T11:44:00.000Z	ispiked	Peps	yeah.
2005-10-24T11:45:00.000Z	ispiked	Peps	it's probaly not something that shold be filed on ipw2200's bug tracker, then.
