2007-11-07T01:21:00.000Z	okeefenokee		i'm having a few computers in my local network, all with different names, all given a dynamic ip-number at boot-up. what would be the easiest way of registering all these computers under their name in the network? I'd like to be able to write something like 'ssh okee1' from the okee2-machine, instead of checking out the ip-number of okee1 and entering that in the ssh-command.
2007-11-07T01:22:00.000Z	new2linx	okeefenokee	easiest is to add each computer to the /etc/hosts file.
2007-11-07T01:22:00.000Z	new2linx	okeefenokee	next easiest is to setup a WINS server, then last is a dns server.
2007-11-07T01:22:00.000Z	okeefenokee	new2linx	But doesn't that demand a fixed ip-number (the hosts-solution)?
2007-11-07T01:23:00.000Z	new2linx	okeefenokee	yes
2007-11-07T01:24:00.000Z	okeefenokee	new2linx	That's not an option :( Another option would then be to let one of the computers function as a wins-server, aye?
2007-11-07T01:24:00.000Z	new2linx	okeefenokee	why is static ip not an option? Yes, WINS server is next then.
2007-11-07T01:24:00.000Z	okeefenokee	new2linx	Because the router serving out the ip-numbers is beyond my control
2007-11-07T01:25:00.000Z	new2linx	okeefenokee	so what! you can hard code I really high IP address for each of your computers.
2007-11-07T01:27:00.000Z	okeefenokee	new2linx	Well, from the given ip-numbers I've had a look at, they vary from ??.???.???.72-222 ... it seems to me that the whole range is used
2007-11-07T01:29:00.000Z	new2linx	okeefenokee	well then, use a WINS server and check this out. http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=88206&highlight=name+resolution
2007-11-07T01:33:00.000Z	okeefenokee	new2linx	The tip looks good. One can assume that the ubuntu server is running samba as well, with wins activated?
2007-11-07T01:35:00.000Z	new2linx	okeefenokee	you can't assume that, you can run ps aux | grep mbd to see if smbd and nmbd are running
2007-11-07T01:35:00.000Z	new2linx	okeefenokee	I don't use WINS so I am not sure what to tell you. I use a hosts file.
2007-11-07T01:36:00.000Z	okeefenokee	new2linx	Naw, I expressed m'self a bit unclearly...I meant that samba has to be installed, with the wins-option on, to have this system work.
2007-11-07T01:37:00.000Z	new2linx	okeefenokee	as I said, I am not sure. if you click on shared folders, then type in the WINS server IP address there, I think it'll install samba yes.
2007-11-07T01:39:00.000Z	okeefenokee	new2linx	Actually, I'm running an command line mode...and I intended to have *one* computer running samba and functioning as a wins-server. Found here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=65385&highlight=wins
2007-11-07T01:39:00.000Z	new2linx	okeefenokee	sounds good. that should work if you follow that guide then. I gotta go. good luck
2007-11-07T01:40:00.000Z	okeefenokee	new2linx	Thank you for the help!
