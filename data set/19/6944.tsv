2007-11-05T07:53:00.000Z	xardion		hola peeps. Trying to find out the absolute bare minimum packages required on ubuntu to run X apps headless, i.e. I only ever want to use SSH X11 forwarding
2007-11-05T07:53:00.000Z	LjL	xardion	why don't you just install the packages you need over ubuntu-minimal? the needed libraries will get installed.
2007-11-05T07:54:00.000Z	xardion		openssh requires xauth to do the forwarding, but installing xauth requires 4GB of dependencies, and that's no good for my platform
2007-11-05T07:54:00.000Z	xardion		I was looking for a possible alternative that would just have the bare minimum libraries and utilities, but no actually ability to run a display
2007-11-05T07:55:00.000Z	LjL	xardion	uh? i only get 10 megs of dependencies
2007-11-05T07:55:00.000Z	xardion		damnit
2007-11-05T07:55:00.000Z	xardion		I can't read
2007-11-05T07:55:00.000Z	xardion		4478Kb
2007-11-05T07:55:00.000Z	xardion		heheheh
2007-11-05T07:55:00.000Z	xardion		you can slap me now
2007-11-05T07:55:00.000Z	LjL		=)
2007-11-05T07:56:00.000Z	xardion		I dunno how I read that as Mb
2007-11-05T07:56:00.000Z	LjL	xardion	are you aware of the minimal cd?
2007-11-05T07:56:00.000Z	xardion		yeah
2007-11-05T07:56:00.000Z	LjL	xardion	it's less than 5 megs
2007-11-05T07:56:00.000Z	xardion		this is a preinstalled virtual machine
2007-11-05T07:56:00.000Z	xardion		I'm not THAT limited, heh
2007-11-05T07:58:00.000Z	LjL	xardion	i have a site at http://apt.byethost14.com/ which can help calculating download sizes for packages and dependencies in advance, perhaps it can be of some use, though it's not updated for Gutsy yet. you can simulate different scenarios and see how much space is taken
2007-11-05T07:58:00.000Z	xardion	LjL	cool
