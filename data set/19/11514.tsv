2006-01-27T06:19:00.000Z	JoeBlow	Terminus	dont really matter i use all linux partitions now anyway
2006-01-27T06:20:00.000Z	Terminus	JoeBlow	i don't dual boot myself so i just use samba so that windows can work with my stuff. :)
2006-01-27T11:58:00.000Z	Terminus	JoeBlow	you have to convert those to ISO. i think a program called binchunk or something like that will work.
2006-01-27T11:58:00.000Z	JoeBlow	Terminus	cool
2006-01-27T12:00:00.000Z	Terminus	JoeBlow	http://he.fi/bchunk/

2006-01-27T12:02:00.000Z	Terminus	JoeBlow	apparently, there's a debian package in their repos so it might be in the ubuntu repos too. :)

2006-01-27T12:04:00.000Z	Terminus	JoeBlow	cool. :)
2006-01-27T12:08:00.000Z	JoeBlow	Terminus	that program works great
2006-01-27T12:09:00.000Z	Terminus	JoeBlow	i've never actually tried using it but at one point, i was wondering the same thing. glad to hear it works. :)
2006-01-27T12:09:00.000Z	JoeBlow	Terminus	really simple command line prog, works easy
2006-01-27T12:09:00.000Z	Terminus	JoeBlow	happy mounting! hehe
2006-01-27T12:10:00.000Z	JoeBlow	Terminus	when i was in windows i took everything i owned and put it .bin and .cue, and i had a lan party server, and when someone needed to reinstall a game they could just get it off their real fast download, and they had to use their own keys, but it made it really easy
