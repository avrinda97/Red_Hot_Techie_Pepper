2007-11-23T21:26:00.000Z	unicycle		Hi everyone
2007-11-23T21:26:00.000Z	unicycle		I've got a question
2007-11-23T21:27:00.000Z	unicycle		anybody ready to answer?
2007-11-23T21:27:00.000Z	ikonia	unicycle	just ask the question
2007-11-23T21:27:00.000Z	unicycle		Ok
2007-11-23T21:28:00.000Z	unicycle	ikonia	I installed the ATI proprietary driver via Envy for my ATI Radeon x1600.  It works, and I get 3000+ FPS in glxgears.  But, any 3d is just a black window.  So, no visible gears in glxgears.
2007-11-23T21:28:00.000Z	unicycle		Also, fglrxinfo gives me all the right things.
2007-11-23T21:28:00.000Z	ikonia		!envy >unicycle
2007-11-23T21:29:00.000Z	unicycle		!envy > unicycle
2007-11-23T21:29:00.000Z	unicycle		doesn't work?
2007-11-23T21:29:00.000Z	ikonia		!envy | unicycle
2007-11-23T21:29:00.000Z	unicycle		Envy is, indeed, supported.
2007-11-23T21:30:00.000Z	ikonia		unicycle no its not
2007-11-23T21:30:00.000Z	unicycle		It has the newest driver
2007-11-23T21:30:00.000Z	ikonia	unicycle	its not supported
2007-11-23T21:30:00.000Z	unicycle		what do you mean by that?
2007-11-23T21:30:00.000Z	ikonia	unicycle	I mean ubuntu does not have anything to do with, nor suppor the envy process
2007-11-23T21:31:00.000Z	unicycle		OK, so what I'm asking is, is there any solution that you know of to my problem?
2007-11-23T21:31:00.000Z	ikonia	unicycle	you've used envy so you've lost support
