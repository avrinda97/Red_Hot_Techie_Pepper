2012-09-05T10:00:00.000Z	camscam		My computer hangs at shutdowns and restarts and I found the solution I just don't know how to save the modifications I make in the terminal to the grub so I can then update the grub. Any help would be appreciated!
2012-09-05T10:01:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	camscam	what is the solution?

2012-09-05T10:02:00.000Z	camscam		WORKAROUND: Type in a terminal:
2012-09-05T10:02:00.000Z	camscam		sudo nano /etc/default/grub
2012-09-05T10:02:00.000Z	camscam		find the line:
2012-09-05T10:02:00.000Z	camscam		GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash"
2012-09-05T10:02:00.000Z	camscam		and change it to:
2012-09-05T10:02:00.000Z	camscam		GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="reboot=pci quiet splash"
2012-09-05T10:02:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	camscam	please use the channel it is your best help. ;)
2012-09-05T10:02:00.000Z	camscam		imma tryin! i'll get a hang of the rules.
2012-09-05T10:03:00.000Z	camscam		i just don't know what he means by save
2012-09-05T10:03:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	camscam	use this command to modify grub then save it and run a grub-update.   gksudo gedit /etc/default/grub
2012-09-05T10:04:00.000Z	camscam		i will try it. thank you for your patience!
2012-09-05T10:09:00.000Z	camscam		willee-nilee: I get to the grub I change what I need to but I can't execute any new commands afterwards to save or do anything
2012-09-05T10:17:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	camscam	I'm not familiar with nano make it easy and use my command to do the same, just close nano.
2012-09-05T10:18:00.000Z	camscam	wilee-nilee	I got it! It was f2 and this it asked me if I wanted to save. thanks for your help!
2012-09-05T10:21:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	camscam	Cool, just be sure to run a update-grub as well.
2012-09-05T10:22:00.000Z	camscam	wilee-nilee	done and done. i'm still trying to grasp this whole terminal thing. pretty interesting. i'm sure i'll be on here again sometime. thanks again. tchuss.
