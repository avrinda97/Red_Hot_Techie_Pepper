2006-04-20T13:53:00.000Z	bjorn_		do you need a firewall in ubuntu?
2006-04-20T13:53:00.000Z	mwe	bjorn_	if you are running any services you need to restrict
2006-04-20T13:54:00.000Z	mwe	bjorn_	by default nothing is listening on any ports I think
2006-04-20T13:55:00.000Z	mwe	bjorn_	like if you have a web server and want to disallow certain ips to connect or whatever
2006-04-20T13:56:00.000Z	mwe	bjorn_	no. nothing is accepting incoming traffic, so
2006-04-20T13:57:00.000Z	mwe	bjorn_	also users are not superusers by default in linux so malware doesn't tend to spread system wide
2006-04-20T13:57:00.000Z	mwe	bjorn_	not that I've had any yet
2006-04-20T13:58:00.000Z	mwe	bjorn_	I don't know any program that does it
2006-04-20T13:58:00.000Z	mwe	bjorn_	it doesn't seem to be a big problem
2006-04-20T13:59:00.000Z	mwe	bjorn_	all file system suffer from fragmentation though
