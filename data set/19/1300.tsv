2011-03-11T05:46:00.000Z	KM0201	Polah	yes... 11.04 (2011, 4th month)
2011-03-11T05:46:00.000Z	KM0201	Polah	thats how all the ubuntu version numbers are used... ubuntu 6.06 (2006, 6th month) an so forth
2011-03-11T05:47:00.000Z	Polah	KM0201	Oh, I didn't know that. I thought it was just X.04 and X.10 just as a trend
2011-03-11T05:47:00.000Z	KM0201	Polah	nope, there's a method to the madness
2011-03-11T05:47:00.000Z	Polah	KM0201	The more you know (:
2011-05-31T05:33:00.000Z	KM0201	Polah	i'd disagree... there could be security issues that come about, that will not be updated
2011-05-31T05:33:00.000Z	Polah	KM0201	That's a good point, actually. If a security issue does come up it won't be officially fixed.
2011-05-31T05:34:00.000Z	KM0201	Polah	chances are, it won't even be unofficially fixed.. depending on what the bug is.
2011-05-31T05:35:00.000Z	Polah	KM0201	Indeed. It's possible but not likely. It is almost two years old now, although official support only stopped a few months ago.
2011-06-04T03:51:00.000Z	KM0201	Polah	xchat doesn't suck?  :)
2011-06-04T03:51:00.000Z	Polah	KM0201	Use it myself, it's pretty good I thought
2011-06-04T03:51:00.000Z	KM0201	Polah	not compared to xchat, but there's certainly a lot worse IRC clients out there
2011-06-04T03:52:00.000Z	Polah	KM0201	We all know Mibbit is actually the best irc client.
2011-09-24T21:35:00.000Z	KM0201	Polah	you could chroot the drive from a Live CD, and create a new user, shouldn't be *that* difficult.
2011-09-24T21:35:00.000Z	Polah	KM0201	Yeah, thoght that would work.
2012-05-13T21:20:00.000Z	Polah	KM0201	you have to prefix it with a !
2012-05-13T21:20:00.000Z	KM0201	Polah	oh, i thought i did... (guess i'm a little to tired to be playing w/ ubottu..lol)
2012-05-13T21:21:00.000Z	KM0201	Polah	but don't think ubottu has never been caught napping on the job, happens frequently.. :)
2012-05-13T21:22:00.000Z	Polah	KM0201	oh yeah. Damn lazy robots.
