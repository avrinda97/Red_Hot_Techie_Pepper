2009-02-22T05:52:00.000Z	kristian2	musikgoat|main	: alright. how come? know of any other sfv checkers that are good and in repo?
2009-02-22T05:55:00.000Z	musikgoat|main	kristian2	well, to be honest, thats what i used in the past, i haven't had any reason to check them as of late... give me a sec to keep looking
2009-02-22T05:56:00.000Z	kristian2	musikgoat|main	: i can't find anything, how do you search the repo for specific tools, like a sfv checker like now?
