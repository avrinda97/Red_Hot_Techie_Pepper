2006-07-24T11:00:00.000Z	skavenge	caonex	yes it does
2006-07-24T11:00:00.000Z	caonex	skavenge	using ndiswrapper?
2006-07-24T11:00:00.000Z	skavenge	caonex	the stock kernel uses bcm43xx kernel driver fine, just install firmware, couple commands
2006-07-24T11:01:00.000Z	caonex	skavenge	aha....did not know that, i was using ndiswrapper which does not work anymore
2006-07-24T11:01:00.000Z	skavenge	caonex	heh yes it does, because im running it
2006-07-24T11:01:00.000Z	caonex	skavenge	 you running ndiswrapper and the broadcom kernel driver at once?
2006-07-24T11:02:00.000Z	caonex	skavenge	you have 64bit?
2006-07-24T11:02:00.000Z	skavenge	caonex	im running the ndis because i knew how to do it and it works, didnt fiddle with the kernel driver but ppl are using it, 32 bit
2006-07-24T11:03:00.000Z	caonex	skavenge	it works differently with my 64bit because i have used it before and did the same configuration and i get an error when doing iwconfig
2006-07-24T11:03:00.000Z	skavenge	caonex	64 bit is another can of worms entirely, depending if your using the 32 or 64 bit driver, etc .. i have no experience with that
2006-07-24T11:03:00.000Z	caonex	skavenge	dhclient eth0 goes crazy
2006-07-24T11:03:00.000Z	caonex	skavenge	have always used 64bit driver
2006-07-24T11:05:00.000Z	skavenge	caonex	i dunno about 64 bit like i said but 32 bit kernel module and nidswrapper work
2006-07-24T11:06:00.000Z	caonex	skavenge	ok, i know 64 bit does not...
2006-07-24T11:06:00.000Z	caonex	skavenge	anyways you said current dapper kernel  2.6.15-26 supports broadcom43xx ?
2006-07-24T11:07:00.000Z	skavenge	caonex	yes it does
2006-07-24T11:10:00.000Z	caonex	skavenge	what about installing the firmware you said?
2006-07-24T11:10:00.000Z	caonex	skavenge	what do you mean?
2006-07-24T11:10:00.000Z	skavenge	caonex	take a look at this if you havent - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/bcm43xx/Dapper it explains everything
