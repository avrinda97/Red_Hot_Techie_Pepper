2008-08-24T14:17:00.000Z	wols_	scream_sayonara	simply go to packages.ubuntu.com. there you can download any package
2008-08-24T14:18:00.000Z	wols_	scream_sayonara	wrong
2008-08-24T14:18:00.000Z	wols_	scream_sayonara	what pages exactly?
2008-08-24T14:19:00.000Z	wols_	scream_sayonara	just curious, what wlan chip?
2008-08-24T14:20:00.000Z	wols_	scream_sayonara	those are NOT the pages you are looking for or the pages I and Dr_willis told you about. go to the proper ones
2008-08-24T14:20:00.000Z	wols_	scream_sayonara	that is no chip√ü
2008-08-24T14:20:00.000Z	wols_	scream_sayonara	then find out more before you install drivers you don't even know if they work
2008-08-24T14:20:00.000Z	wols_	scream_sayonara	if it "Just worked" it doesn't use ndiswrapper
2008-08-24T14:21:00.000Z	wols_	scream_sayonara	answer my question: what wlan chip
