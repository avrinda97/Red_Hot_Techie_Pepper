2011-04-29T23:45:00.000Z	tripelb	botcity	belinrahs does that help?
2011-04-29T23:47:00.000Z	botcity	tripelb	10gigs can you use a usb stick? may be easier
2011-04-29T23:48:00.000Z	tripelb	botcity	yes I can. I still want to fix the issue. I'll take it to "ubuntuforums" and use the "good old american bailing wire" trick that you suggest. :P
2011-04-29T23:51:00.000Z	botcity	tripelb	is the hdd encrypted ?

2011-04-30T00:25:00.000Z	botcity	tripelb	how where you transferring files

2011-04-30T00:57:00.000Z	tripelb	botcity	I dont know how to copy files from that drive to this drive. I dont have permissions. I know the password to both drives. I would do it in terminal if I knew how to copy cirectories and subdirectories. I dont think the cp command works for that, does it?  Then could I use sudo? That doesnt make sense because root on A wouldnt have permissions on B. Of course I know the password to B, it's mine and I can boot from it. (I must l
