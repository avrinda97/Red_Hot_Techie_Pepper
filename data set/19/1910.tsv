2010-09-06T19:16:00.000Z	rblst		i cannot use my logitech webcam with skype under ubuntu 9.10, this has been so for some of the previous releases too, although it worked fine under 8.04, is it only my impression that ubuntu is actually getting worse?
2010-09-06T19:17:00.000Z	bodwick	rblst	skype doesn't detect your cam?
2010-09-06T19:19:00.000Z	rblst	bodwick	it does detect it, but when i test it, nothing appears and cpu goes up close to 100%
2010-09-06T19:19:00.000Z	rblst	bodwick	i have two logitech cams, both used to work okay, now i cannot use either
2010-09-06T19:21:00.000Z	rblst	bodwick	i have tried loading libraries, changing xml con file, reverting to earlier versions, installing static version from medibuntu; no luck
2010-09-06T19:23:00.000Z	rblst		anybody here who can help me using my logitech cam with skype in 10.04?
2010-09-06T19:24:00.000Z	bodwick	rblst	does cheese detect  those webcams?
2010-09-06T19:25:00.000Z	rblst	bodwick	i'll have to check
2010-09-06T19:27:00.000Z	rblst	bodwick	yes cheese can use the cam, but CPU load is 100%, so it's practically useless
2010-09-06T19:28:00.000Z	bodwick	rblst	which process usues most cpu when trying to use the webcam?
2010-09-06T19:29:00.000Z	rblst	bodwick	cheese uses above 90%
2010-09-06T19:32:00.000Z	bodwick	rblst	quick google shows it could be pulse autio related
2010-09-06T19:32:00.000Z	bodwick	rblst	try disabling auto-respawn, kill pulse audio and test if the issue persists
2010-09-06T19:33:00.000Z	rblst	bodwick	i wonder how video and audio is connected, but thanks, i'll do just what you suggest

2010-09-06T20:10:00.000Z	rblst	bodwick	i've tried killing pulseaudio, the problem remains; the forum thread you sent me is not about skype video
