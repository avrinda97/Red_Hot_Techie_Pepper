2008-01-14T12:12:00.000Z	adub	bazhang	do you know what the problem could be
2008-01-14T12:13:00.000Z	bazhang	adub	what is the situation? you try to open a word 2003 .doc file and it does not open with open office; please be precise
2008-01-14T12:15:00.000Z	adub	bazhang	the program will not load
2008-01-14T12:15:00.000Z	bazhang	adub	open office? have you tried just opening it first and then from the open dialog choice to do it that way?
2008-01-14T12:16:00.000Z	bazhang	adub	you are not really responding clearly to my question--not sure how to help in that case
2008-01-14T12:17:00.000Z	bazhang	adub	how did you install them? via automatix or other
2008-01-14T12:23:00.000Z	bazhang	adub	sounds like you have a number of issues to deal with--I have to step out for a couple of hours but will be back later if you would like to resume; other fine folks here may be able to help as well

2011-02-17T14:41:00.000Z	adub	bazhang	yes the alternate iso install for people that are having a hard time with the main release
2011-02-17T14:41:00.000Z	bazhang	adub	that's odd, worked fine here
