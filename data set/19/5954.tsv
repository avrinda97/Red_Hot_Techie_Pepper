2008-04-11T08:36:00.000Z	tuxus	icesword	why would you want to?
2008-04-11T08:36:00.000Z	icesword	tuxus	my xorg.conf is broken
2008-04-11T08:38:00.000Z	tuxus	icesword	then fix it: from a terminal, sudo dpkge-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2008-04-11T08:38:00.000Z	icesword	tuxus	no doesn't work,it won't let me change resolution and refresh rate and configure graphic card and select drivers
2008-04-11T08:39:00.000Z	tuxus	icesword	it will write a fresh xorg.conf file
2008-04-11T08:39:00.000Z	tuxus	icesword	drivers come after that
2008-04-11T08:39:00.000Z	icesword	tuxus	no option to select that
2008-04-11T08:39:00.000Z	tuxus	icesword	what do you mean?
2008-04-11T08:40:00.000Z	icesword	tuxus	no options to configure my graphic card and screen
2008-04-11T08:40:00.000Z	tuxus	icesword	so when you do the command I suggested, what happens?
2008-04-11T08:41:00.000Z	icesword	tuxus	a window pop up,ask me to select keboard and something else
2008-04-11T08:41:00.000Z	tuxus	icesword	thats right, keep going
2008-04-11T08:41:00.000Z	tuxus	icesword	you could start by accepting the defaults
2008-04-11T08:42:00.000Z	icesword	tuxus	i tried that many times,no options for me to choose screen etc...didn't work
2008-04-11T08:42:00.000Z	tuxus	icesword	hmmm
2008-04-11T08:43:00.000Z	tuxus	icesword	it won't give you an option to select screen type "A" from manufacturer "so-and-so", but what DO you get?
2008-04-11T08:43:00.000Z	icesword	tuxus	choose keyboard and something i don't remember
