2010-01-30T13:59:00.000Z	z3rongod		I am running a HLDS (game) server on windows 7 and i am concerned about CPU and RAM usage. On windows the server uses about 62MB Private set memory and 105 MB virtual memory, while CPU usage on average is about 0.5 % of an AMD 5000 2.61 dual core.
2010-01-30T13:59:00.000Z	z3rongod		Will i have any significant gains in performance?
2010-01-30T13:59:00.000Z	z3rongod		I mean less CPU and RAM usage?
2010-01-30T14:00:00.000Z	z3rongod		No i mean i want to try it on ubuntu :)
2010-01-30T14:01:00.000Z	z3rongod		The thing is i don't have another HDD running around and i don't know if it's suitable to try it on a live CD
2010-01-30T14:01:00.000Z	z3rongod		to test differences using a live CD i mean
2010-01-30T14:02:00.000Z	z3rongod		Does ubuntu have an utility to see the CPU and RAM usage of an application?

2010-01-30T14:04:00.000Z	z3rongod		thanks FG2 noted
2010-01-30T14:04:00.000Z	z3rongod		Also pardon my ignorance but what about virtual RAM on ubuntu? Is this feature available?
2010-01-30T14:05:00.000Z	FG2		You essentially mean swap.
2010-01-30T14:05:00.000Z	z3rongod		i think so FG2
2010-01-30T14:05:00.000Z	FG2		Its also marked on the graph in System Monitor.
2010-01-30T14:06:00.000Z	z3rongod	FG2	i want to try to determine if there are any significant gains in performances for an application. I don't have another HDD to install ubuntu, will it matter if i try it on a live CD ?
2010-01-30T14:06:00.000Z	FG2	z3rongod	Its also marked on the double graph of memory, Resources tab, in green color.
2010-01-30T14:06:00.000Z	FG2		You can dual boot
2010-01-30T14:07:00.000Z	z3rongod	FG2	last time i installed ubuntu on a hdd with windows, it f***ed up windows' boot
