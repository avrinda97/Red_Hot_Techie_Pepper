2008-08-18T21:21:00.000Z	ikonia	threedee	ok - you have a choice of listening how to fix it, or using something else, it's your call
2008-08-18T21:22:00.000Z	ikonia	threedee	you have been given 2 forum threads with a response
2008-08-18T21:27:00.000Z	ikonia	threedee	listen very carefully - ubuntu can play CD's your base intalls (yours and bazhang's) are the same - so if bazhang's can, yours can too, we just need to work out the issue
2008-08-18T21:28:00.000Z	threedee	ikonia	that is obvious
2008-08-18T21:28:00.000Z	ikonia	threedee	ok - great, so why not listen to the people helping you to work it through
2008-08-18T21:28:00.000Z	ikonia	threedee	2 people have provided information/forum threads to get some more info
2008-08-18T21:32:00.000Z	ikonia	threedee	ther eyou go
2008-08-18T21:32:00.000Z	ikonia	threedee	oops, sorr
2008-08-18T21:35:00.000Z	ikonia	threedee	what software ?
2008-08-18T21:36:00.000Z	threedee	ikonia	there are several players - I dont know who to hold responsible - Totem, Rythembox, Xine
2008-08-18T21:37:00.000Z	ikonia	threedee	it looks like ubuntu can't mount the cd - rather than the players
