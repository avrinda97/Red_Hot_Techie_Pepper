2009-09-08T14:21:00.000Z	theoros	jess12345	you mean modify the access, move the files elsewhere, and install ubuntu?
2009-09-08T14:25:00.000Z	theoros	jess12345	that sort of depends on knowing what the exact problem with the install is
2009-09-08T14:25:00.000Z	theoros	jess12345	but why can't you use the livecd to alter the permissions?
2009-09-08T14:26:00.000Z	jess12345	theoros	yes that is what i was going to do, alter permissions, but i will end up with 2 versions of ubuntu on the machine
2009-09-08T14:27:00.000Z	jess12345	theoros	currently have ubuntu 9.04 /dev/sda1 (which has perl broken so no desktop) also have swap /dev/sda5 and now will install 9.04
2009-09-08T14:27:00.000Z	theoros	jess12345	and the livecd, which will let you access files when you boot from it
2009-09-08T14:28:00.000Z	jess12345	theoros	yes i can access the old 9.04 drives easily its just that the desktop is busted, but cant repair the damn thing using command line
2009-09-08T14:29:00.000Z	theoros	jess12345	you _boot from the livecd into the operating system which is provided by using the livecd_
2009-09-08T14:29:00.000Z	jess12345	theoros	i have postfix so if you want to see output can do this ?
2009-09-08T14:29:00.000Z	jess12345	theoros	if that could help shed some light
2009-09-08T14:30:00.000Z	theoros	jess12345	i am still not understanding why you can't boot from the livecd and use THAT operating system
2009-09-08T14:30:00.000Z	jess12345	theoros	i can do that but its not a permanent solution is it ?
2009-09-08T14:30:00.000Z	theoros	jess12345	it will get you your files.
2009-09-08T14:30:00.000Z	theoros	jess12345	once you have the files on an external drive or something, then you fix by just installing over ubuntu
2009-09-08T14:31:00.000Z	jess12345	theoros	i couldnt be hassled with recovering all of them right now, so i just wanted to get the machine up and running and recover a select few and do the rest later
2009-09-08T14:31:00.000Z	jess12345	theoros	surely there is a way to recover the old operating system ?
2009-09-08T14:32:00.000Z	theoros	jess12345	you don't have all the essential files in /home?
2009-09-08T14:33:00.000Z	jess12345	theoros	er now, i dont think i have been very elegant in my file keeping, they are a little over the place, if only i could fix the perl thing?
2009-09-08T14:34:00.000Z	jess12345	theoros	i think they are all in home, or most of them but others are dottoed around, like downloads from mozilla, print to file pdf's wherever they land
