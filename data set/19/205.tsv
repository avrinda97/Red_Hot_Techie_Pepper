2012-06-25T07:16:00.000Z	asterismo		hey i need help with something
2012-06-25T07:16:00.000Z	asterismo		i'm using xubuntu 12.04
2012-06-25T07:17:00.000Z	asterismo		i'm trying to set a keyboard shortcut in XFCE
2012-06-25T07:17:00.000Z	asterismo		the the command i want to run is "amixer set Master toggle"
2012-06-25T07:17:00.000Z	asterismo		and the key is XF86AudioMute
2012-06-25T07:17:00.000Z	asterismo		and the command does not execute
2012-06-25T07:18:00.000Z	asterismo		it does execute with other key combination
2012-06-25T07:18:00.000Z	asterismo		but that key is in my keyboard indicating the mute funciton
2012-06-25T07:18:00.000Z	asterismo		why it cannot be setup like this?
2012-06-25T07:19:00.000Z	wifiman	asterismo	maybe something else already has that key bound; probably the XFCE volume control applet
2012-06-25T07:26:00.000Z	wifiman	asterismo	if you can prevent the volume control from running at login, it should work
2012-06-25T07:28:00.000Z	asterismo	wifiman	so you say that xfce4-volumed captures the key before the actual key shortcut applies?
2012-06-25T07:28:00.000Z	wifiman	asterismo	pretty much yeah
2012-06-25T07:28:00.000Z	wifiman	asterismo	and yeah disabling xfce4-volumed and logging out and back in should make it work
2012-06-25T07:28:00.000Z	wifiman	asterismo	although this will probably remove the normal behavior of any other volume keys
2012-06-25T07:28:00.000Z	asterismo	wifiman	but would i lost my volume notifications?
2012-06-25T07:29:00.000Z	wifiman	asterismo	possibly, idk
2012-06-25T07:31:00.000Z	wifiman	asterismo	i was thinking at least banshee supports alsa
2012-06-25T07:55:00.000Z	asterismo	wifiman	i removed pulseaudio
