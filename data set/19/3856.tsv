2010-01-03T22:15:00.000Z	evon	hakon	ok so move all the files from linux that you would like to keep over to the windows partition using Nautilus
2010-01-03T22:16:00.000Z	evon	hakon	then reboot your computer using the ubuntu live CD and use gparted to delete the ubuntu partition and expand the windows partition
2010-01-03T22:16:00.000Z	evon	hakon	i would back up important files before you do this.
