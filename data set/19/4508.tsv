2009-01-04T00:20:00.000Z	Helo1234		hello guys, im trying to change the location of my home folder to a different partition. How can i move /home if it is in use?
2009-01-04T00:21:00.000Z	DasEI	Helo1234	first set up a new, big enough parti ...
2009-01-04T00:21:00.000Z	Helo1234	DasEI	done
2009-01-04T00:22:00.000Z	DasEI	Helo1234	then copy your old /home to the new.....
2009-01-04T00:22:00.000Z	DasEI	Helo1234	then alter fstab
2009-01-04T00:23:00.000Z	DasEI	Helo1234	let's say you did a new parti, sda6
2009-01-04T00:23:00.000Z	DasEI	Helo1234	first you mount it anywhere,  /mnt/any
2009-01-04T00:23:00.000Z	Helo1234	DasEI	thats what i did
2009-01-04T00:23:00.000Z	DasEI	Helo1234	then you copy everything from / home to it
2009-01-04T00:24:00.000Z	Helo1234	DasEI	done
2009-01-04T00:24:00.000Z	DasEI	Helo1234	then you got to alter fstab to use f.e. sda6  as home
2009-01-04T00:25:00.000Z	Helo1234	DasEI	but there is an entry for home already
2009-01-04T00:25:00.000Z	DasEI	Helo1234	you got to change it then
2009-01-04T00:25:00.000Z	Helo1234	DasEI	and i dont know the UUID of the new partition
2009-01-04T00:26:00.000Z	Helo1234	DasEI	heres my problem... it doesnt show that partition...
2009-01-04T00:26:00.000Z	DasEI	Helo1234	> and erase quotes for fstab
2009-01-04T00:26:00.000Z	Helo1234	DasEI	ok, my bad, forgot to use sudo
2009-01-04T00:28:00.000Z	Helo1234	DasEI	what is that?
2009-01-04T00:32:00.000Z	Helo1234	DasEI	i just edited fstab, files are copied, now how can i move the home?
