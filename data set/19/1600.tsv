2011-01-05T23:55:00.000Z	DarsVaeda		where do i find my usb devices? I shall do this "sudo chmod 777 /proc/bus/usb/busid/deviceid" but that path does not exists on my machine -> natty 64bit
2011-01-05T23:56:00.000Z	gobbe	DarsVaeda	what you are trying to do?
2011-01-05T23:56:00.000Z	DarsVaeda	gobbe	i follow a tutorial
2011-01-05T23:56:00.000Z	gobbe	DarsVaeda	would you mind to tell us what tutorial?
2011-01-05T23:57:00.000Z	DarsVaeda	gobbe	i mean ^^
2011-01-05T23:57:00.000Z	DarsVaeda	gobbe	i just need to make that usb device user writeable thats it
2011-01-05T23:58:00.000Z	gobbe	DarsVaeda	well. that's what i asked, why you need to make raw device writable? altering something under proc means that in next boot changes you made are gone
2011-01-05T23:59:00.000Z	DarsVaeda	gobbe	tutorial says so, i dunno why
2011-01-05T23:59:00.000Z	gobbe	DarsVaeda	well, that's why i asked you to give this tutorial :)

2011-01-06T00:02:00.000Z	DarsVaeda	gobbe	i guess i know why ;) if i try to calibrate with the tool mentioned in the tutorial it gives me a access denied (insufficient permission) error
2011-01-06T00:02:00.000Z	gobbe	DarsVaeda	yes, that's reason
2011-01-06T00:03:00.000Z	DarsVaeda	gobbe	so now my question remains, how do i do it and can i do i permanent (if its a good idea to do so)
2011-01-06T00:05:00.000Z	gobbe	DarsVaeda	i'm sorry, but i don't know how to handle this with correct way :-/
2011-01-06T00:05:00.000Z	gobbe	DarsVaeda	i'll try to see
2011-01-06T00:07:00.000Z	gobbe	DarsVaeda	however, /dev/bus/usb
2011-01-06T00:07:00.000Z	gobbe	DarsVaeda	there's what you were looking for at first
