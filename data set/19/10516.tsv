2006-06-07T16:42:00.000Z	pvangarde	Kyral	I get an error after it starts compiling
2006-06-07T16:43:00.000Z	Kyral	pvangarde	you are gonna have to be a little more discriptive
2006-06-07T16:43:00.000Z	pvangarde	Kyral	when it gets to compiling a usb module
2006-06-07T16:43:00.000Z	pvangarde	Kyral	the module is for a usb network IEEE adapter
2006-06-07T16:44:00.000Z	Kyral	pvangarde	yes yes, but what exaclty is the error?
2006-06-07T16:44:00.000Z	Kyral	pvangarde	you may want to try compiling agan and droppping the output into Pastebin
2006-06-07T16:44:00.000Z	pvangarde	Kyral	i'm waiting to get it again, i removed the module from the configuration
2006-06-07T16:44:00.000Z	pvangarde	Kyral	okay, thanks

2006-06-07T16:45:00.000Z	pvangarde	Kyral	well, if the error was descriptive i'd probably be able to fix it, but make just reported Error 2
2006-06-07T16:46:00.000Z	pvangarde	Kyral	and then 'leaving ...;
2006-06-07T16:46:00.000Z	pvangarde	Kyral	if i get it again, ill paste it
2006-06-07T16:46:00.000Z	Kyral	pvangarde	yup
2006-06-07T16:56:00.000Z	pvangarde	Kyral	i did not get the usb error at that module since it isnt getting compiled this time around. I'll let you know if i get anything else! thanks though
2006-06-07T16:56:00.000Z	Kyral	pvangarde	Good to hear it
