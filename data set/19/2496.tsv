2010-03-18T21:55:00.000Z	york105	Soni18771	you got two options, you can attempt to find out what's gone wrong - search log files in /var/log or reinstall gnome desktop using > sudo aptitude remove ubuntu-desktop && sudo aptitude install ubuntu-desktop
2010-03-18T21:55:00.000Z	Soni18771	york105	thanks, i am doing.
