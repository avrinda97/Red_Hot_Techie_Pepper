2007-09-04T15:05:00.000Z	Kworth		can I find out over console which grafic card is actually built into my system even though no driver for it is installed?
2007-09-04T15:07:00.000Z	Kworth		is there a command that shows all my hardware?
2007-09-04T15:09:00.000Z	Kworth		so wher do i find in lshw my grafic card, where should it be there under which category
2007-09-04T15:11:00.000Z	Kworth		is nvidia c51 a grafic card?
2007-09-04T06:52:00.000Z	Kworth		is there a way to get the keyring manager to run with firefox
2007-09-04T06:53:00.000Z	Vlet	Kworth	what do you mean by 'run'? Doesn't the keyring manager 'run' every time an application tries to access it?
2007-09-04T06:54:00.000Z	Kworth	Vlet	my firefox doesn't access it, it saves it passwords somewhere else
2007-09-04T06:54:00.000Z	Vlet	Kworth	ahh, I see - you want firefox to store it's passwords in the keyring manager. Nope, it doesn't do that :(
2007-09-04T06:55:00.000Z	Kworth	Vlet	is there an other password application that is compatible with firefox?
2007-09-04T06:55:00.000Z	Kworth		!password
2007-09-04T06:56:00.000Z	Vlet	Kworth	Firefox is not designed to 'outsource' is password storage. That would require some hacking.
2007-09-04T06:57:00.000Z	Kworth	Vlet	and can I enter manually passwords into password save?
2007-09-04T06:58:00.000Z	Vlet	Kworth	hmm... I doubt it... if you really want to investigate, #firefox on irc.mozilla.org would know better
2007-09-04T06:58:00.000Z	Vlet	Kworth	It would make sense for it to store it's passes in the keyring manager though :-/
2007-09-04T06:59:00.000Z	Kworth	Vlet	Evolution can do that, can I import mails from Thunderbird to Evolution?
2007-09-04T07:00:00.000Z	Vlet	Kworth	ask google ;)
2007-09-04T07:01:00.000Z	Vlet		!cake
2007-09-04T07:03:00.000Z	Kworth		I need an password manager that works together with Firefox - anyone a clue?
2007-09-04T07:07:00.000Z	Vlet	Kworth	I already told you. there is none. wirefox was not designed to outsource it's password storage. If you need further info, go to #firefox on irc.mozilla.org
