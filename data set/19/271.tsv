2012-05-05T14:35:00.000Z	cagoccione		Hi. I'm setting up a Lubuntu desktop for school PCs. I need to "block" the screen, to make sure that desktop icons remain in their position so that the user can't move them.
2012-05-05T14:35:00.000Z	cagoccione		To avoid the deletion of them I removed write permissions.... Now I need this ^^^
2012-05-05T14:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cagoccione	you could mark the ~/Desktop folder as read only to the owner
2012-05-05T14:38:00.000Z	cagoccione	ActionParsnip	I already did that. That avoids the deletion of files, but they still can be "moved"
2012-05-05T14:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cagoccione	ahhh, hmm not sure there. I know what you mean
2012-05-05T14:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cagoccione	let me see what's what
2012-05-05T14:40:00.000Z	cagoccione	ActionParsnip	I need only to know in which file lxde put the icon position. It just needs a read-only permission and it's done
2012-05-05T14:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cagoccione	asked in #lxde ?
2012-05-05T14:41:00.000Z	cagoccione	ActionParsnip	yeah, they're all idlers
2012-05-26T14:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cagoccione	maybe in ~/.bash_logout
2012-05-26T14:11:00.000Z	cagoccione	ActionParsnip	maybe?
2012-05-26T14:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cagoccione	well......try it.
2012-05-26T14:11:00.000Z	cagoccione	ActionParsnip	does it work only with shell logout? I need it also for graphical one
2012-05-26T14:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cagoccione	it doesn't cost anything to try
2012-05-26T14:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cagoccione	which file browser
2012-05-26T14:36:00.000Z	cagoccione	ActionParsnip	Dr_Willis: I think it is openbox...! I've Lubuntu 11.10!
2012-05-26T14:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cagoccione	in help -> about   what does it say?
2012-05-26T14:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cagoccione	ok so now we know the app
2012-05-26T14:44:00.000Z	cagoccione	ActionParsnip	hmm .bash_logout works only for the shell
