2006-09-30T08:43:00.000Z	semPid		should i install the windowsXP drivers through ndiaswrapper ?
2006-09-30T08:44:00.000Z	Kyral	semPid	It could be the range on the connection
2006-09-30T08:44:00.000Z	Kyral	semPid	You can be connected but if the signal is weak then nothing is gonna happen
2006-09-30T08:44:00.000Z	semPid	Kyral	the signal is enough i think
2006-09-30T08:44:00.000Z	Kyral	semPid	*Shrug* WLANs are a bitch
2006-09-30T08:44:00.000Z	semPid		how can i check that in linux ?
2006-09-30T08:45:00.000Z	semPid		i've tested it @ win

2006-09-30T08:45:00.000Z	semPid		ok
2006-09-30T08:45:00.000Z	Kyral	semPid	or sudo iwlist <interface> scanning (this displays a list of all WLANs in range)
2006-09-30T08:46:00.000Z	semPid		well it has a lot of stuff when i type in ifconfig

2006-09-30T08:48:00.000Z	semPid	Kyral	its enough ?
