2010-02-14T05:49:00.000Z	zcat[1]		Ohhh, another question; firefox keeps going frozen grey and dim for 30s at a time, every install, even doing it in lucid. any hints how to troubleshoot this?
2010-02-14T05:50:00.000Z	zcat[1]		!info grub-legacy nfrs
2010-02-14T05:50:00.000Z	zcat[1]		!info grub-legacy | nfrs
2010-02-14T05:50:00.000Z	zcat[1]		hmm, wtf?
2010-02-14T05:52:00.000Z	nfrs	zcat[1]	perhaps you should just say whatever you wanted to say?
2010-02-14T05:52:00.000Z	zcat[1]	nfrs	 yeah, I think I spent too much time in squeze already
2010-02-14T05:53:00.000Z	zcat[1]	nfrs	 should just be a matter on installing the 'grub' package and running update-grub ?
2010-02-14T05:53:00.000Z	nfrs	zcat[1]	I have the package, now the purpose of update-grub is unclear to me. I run grub-install, which seems to work fine
2010-02-14T05:54:00.000Z	zcat[1]	nfrs	 update-grub rebuilds the /boot/grum/benu.lst for you
2010-02-14T05:54:00.000Z	nfrs	zcat[1]	I don't need that, menu.lst is already correct
2010-02-14T05:54:00.000Z	nfrs	zcat[1]	or should be
2010-02-14T05:56:00.000Z	zcat[1]	nfrs	 there's a way to install grub from the grub command line too, probably !grub links to it ;)
2010-02-14T05:57:00.000Z	zcat[1]	nfrs	 so what was the question anyway?
2010-02-14T05:57:00.000Z	nfrs	zcat[1]	the question is why does it produce "error 22" on boot...
2010-02-14T05:58:00.000Z	zcat[1]	nfrs	 probably confusion between where BIOS sees devices and where grub sees them
2010-02-14T05:58:00.000Z	zcat[1]	nfrs	 check the boot order if you have more than one drive, you may be booting from an old broken mbr on the wrong drive?
2010-02-14T06:00:00.000Z	nfrs	zcat[1]	I've already looked at that... booting from /dev/sdc, root fs is /dev/sda2, /boot is /dev/sda1
2010-02-14T06:00:00.000Z	nfrs	zcat[1]	installing grub onto /dev/sdc
2010-02-14T06:02:00.000Z	nfrs	zcat[1]	I'll try something else. bb
