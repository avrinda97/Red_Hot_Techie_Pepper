2010-07-09T18:32:00.000Z	devi		hi everyone, can someone help me with installing my printer?
2010-07-09T18:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	devi	what printer
2010-07-09T18:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	devi	brother do linux drivers, head to the brother site
2010-07-09T18:34:00.000Z	devi	ActionParsnip	I tried that, but what do I do once I downloaded the driver...?
2010-07-09T18:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	devi	most times they are debs so install them like any other deb
2010-07-09T18:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	devi	ubuntu doesnt expect you to be
2010-07-09T18:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	devi	what filename have you downloaded?
2010-07-09T18:36:00.000Z	devi	ActionParsnip	I just saw I doewnloaded 2 times the rpm files.. there r some deb too, should I try that?
2010-07-09T18:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	devi	ubuntu doesn't use rpm.
2010-07-09T18:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	devi	run this command and it will be fine:    cd ~; wget http://solutions.brother.com/Library/sol/printer/linux/rpmfiles/lpr_debian/dcp135clpr-1.0.1-1.i386.deb; sudo dpkg -i ./dcp135clpr-1.0.1-1.i386.deb; sudo apt-get -f install; rm ./dcp135clpr-1.0.1-1.i386.deb
2010-07-09T18:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	devi	that command will install it for you
2010-07-09T18:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	devi	just run the command I gave and it will install. If you then attatch your printer it may install, if not then run through the printer install wizard and the driver will be in the list
2010-07-09T18:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	devi	sure, pastebin away
2010-07-09T18:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	devi	Dr_Willis: don't you need to run the browser with gksudo tough?
2010-07-09T18:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	devi	http://solutions.brother.com/linux/sol/printer/linux/lpr_drivers.html    grab the link on the RIGHT hand side for your model, that is a deb file. You can then download it and double click it to install
2010-07-09T19:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	devi	just download the file and double click it, sounds just like you would do in windows
2010-07-09T19:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	devi	how is it confusing....
2010-07-09T19:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	devi	there are 2 columns, the left is for RPM files (for redhat /  mandriva etc) and the right column is for DEB files (for ubuntu and debian etc)
2010-07-09T19:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	devi	that deb file will give you the driver you need.
