2007-01-09T13:23:00.000Z	apokryphos	ikonia	hello?
2007-01-09T13:23:00.000Z	ikonia	apokryphos	sorry to call you - its probably a bit over the top. The user Giona is constnalty posting urls to steve jobs key note speach on you tube, I've asked the user to stop as its nothing to do with ubuntu, but I think it may be a bot
2007-01-09T13:25:00.000Z	apokryphos	ikonia	if it's not an emergency then it's a good idea to see if there's an active op first, but thanks.
2007-01-09T13:25:00.000Z	ikonia	apokryphos	I did try, but no-one responded
2007-01-13T17:21:00.000Z	apokryphos	ikonia	what's the problem?
2007-01-13T17:22:00.000Z	ikonia	apokryphos	bang on queue - thanks the problem is the user "robin__" constantly chatting about heavy metal and causing interuption
2007-01-13T17:23:00.000Z	apokryphos	ikonia	calm down
2007-01-13T17:24:00.000Z	ikonia	apokryphos	saw you "un op" thought you'd left
