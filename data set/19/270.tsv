2012-06-27T19:39:00.000Z	drag0nius		i know there are some models which do not yet have drivers for 12.04 (like mine gtx 560)
2012-06-27T19:40:00.000Z	drag0nius		i have no problems dual monitors one for DVI other with VGA->DVI adapter
2012-06-27T19:41:00.000Z	drag0nius		then check it, nvidia has delays with drivers for linux OS
2012-06-27T19:42:00.000Z	drag0nius		then state your problem
2012-06-27T19:43:00.000Z	drag0nius		getting any error message or sth?
2012-06-27T19:44:00.000Z	drag0nius		you tried apt-get?
2012-06-27T19:44:00.000Z	drag0nius		so we know if its software center or something else
2012-06-27T19:46:00.000Z	genii-around	drag0nius	I'm not sure where you're getting the idea your gtx560 is not supported by the driver in 12.04 ... the driver is version 295.40 and gtx is quite clearly on the Supported Products at http://www.nvidia.com/object/linux-display-amd64-295.40-driver (64bit) and at http://www.nvidia.com/object/linux-display-ia32-295.40-driver ( 32 bit)
2012-07-04T19:22:00.000Z	genii-around	drag0nius	Yes
2012-07-04T20:10:00.000Z	genii-around	drag0nius	If you have been swapping out a bunch of networking cards in the same box, you may want to clear out the contents of /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules
2012-07-04T20:19:00.000Z	drag0nius	genii-around	ty, clearing those rules helped
2012-07-04T20:19:00.000Z	genii-around	drag0nius	You're welcome
2012-07-04T23:33:00.000Z	genii-around	drag0nius	You can use the trick of reversing their ethX designations in the 70-persistent-net.rules file I directed you at earlier
2012-07-04T23:43:00.000Z	drag0nius	genii-around	the file has nothing but comments right now
2012-07-04T23:44:00.000Z	genii-around	drag0nius	Interesting. Usually lines like: SUBSYSTEM=="net", ACTION=="add", DRIVERS=="?*", ATTR{address}=="00:1d:72:ed:4b:9e", ATTR{dev_id}=="0x0", ATTR{type}=="1", KERNEL=="eth*", NAME="eth0"
2012-07-04T23:45:00.000Z	genii-around	drag0nius	So when two lines and one is eth0 the other eth1, you can just reverse them in there, takes effect next boot
2012-07-04T23:47:00.000Z	genii-around	drag0nius	I haven't tried that but it *should* work. Maybe move it someplace safe though first
2012-07-04T23:53:00.000Z	genii-around	drag0nius	Are you shutting the machine down in a clean way usually?
2012-07-04T23:54:00.000Z	genii-around	drag0nius	That is not really a "clean" way
