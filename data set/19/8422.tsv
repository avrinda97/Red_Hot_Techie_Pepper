2007-03-30T07:13:00.000Z	CoolMatty		Okay, I believe I found the problem in booting ubuntu's installer. It's crashing after loading USB devices. However, I tried turning off the USB probing in the boot options... but it's still doing it!
2007-03-30T07:14:00.000Z	neozen	CoolMatty	how much ram is in your box?
2007-03-30T07:15:00.000Z	neozen	CoolMatty	are you _sure_ about the exact figure of 120?
2007-03-30T07:15:00.000Z	neozen	CoolMatty	b/c that's less then the graphical installer's minimum requirements
2007-03-30T07:15:00.000Z	neozen	CoolMatty	you need at least 128 to run that
2007-03-30T07:16:00.000Z	neozen	CoolMatty	get the alternate install for your particular situation
2007-03-30T07:16:00.000Z	neozen	CoolMatty	...well that's a horse of a different color
2007-03-30T07:16:00.000Z	neozen	CoolMatty	do you happen to know what chipset your usb ports use?
2007-03-30T07:17:00.000Z	neozen	CoolMatty	and when you say CRASHING what is it saying?
2007-03-30T07:17:00.000Z	neozen	CoolMatty	try turning it off in your bios?
2007-03-30T07:18:00.000Z	neozen	CoolMatty	what laptop/bios is this?
2007-03-30T07:18:00.000Z	neozen	CoolMatty	lol
2007-03-30T07:18:00.000Z	CoolMatty	neozen	It's an IBM Thinkpad iSeries... hold on
2007-03-30T07:18:00.000Z	neozen	CoolMatty	really
2007-03-30T07:18:00.000Z	neozen	CoolMatty	I've got a thinkpad r60e.... several options here
2007-03-30T07:19:00.000Z	neozen	CoolMatty	there should be an option to shut off usb
2007-03-30T07:19:00.000Z	CoolMatty	neozen	in my bios, I can change date/time, boot order, speedstep, and that's literally all :p
2007-03-30T07:19:00.000Z	neozen	CoolMatty	bummer dude
2007-03-30T07:19:00.000Z	CoolMatty	neozen	I've tried to turn off usb probing via boot options, but for some crazy reason it seems to be ignoring that option and doing it anyway
