2007-05-02T16:39:00.000Z	bobbob1016	dimas__	your USB should be working, the webcam might not be
2007-05-02T16:40:00.000Z	dimas__	bobbob1016	the porgrams tha use the webcam doesnt find the device
2007-05-02T16:40:00.000Z	dimas__		and i find out is in a different location
2007-05-02T16:40:00.000Z	bobbob1016	dimas__	if the webcam isn't, you need to google/search the forums/tell us the webcam type, I'm pretty sure the webcam is the problem, you need to find out how to get the webcam working, the USB is probably working
2007-05-02T16:41:00.000Z	bobbob1016	dimas__	also, make sure that webcam works with the programs you are trying to use
