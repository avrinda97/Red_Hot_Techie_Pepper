2008-11-08T06:25:00.000Z	jpg_ny	gigel2007	you don't really need to get one
2008-11-08T06:25:00.000Z	gigel2007	jpg_ny	really? what if someone is using cain and abel ?
2008-11-08T06:26:00.000Z	jpg_ny	gigel2007	you can use the iptable it comes with your linux
2008-11-08T06:27:00.000Z	jpg_ny	gigel2007	ufw is the uncomplicated firewall
2008-11-08T06:28:00.000Z	jpg_ny	gigel2007	well in case you use samba you mean ?
2008-11-08T06:29:00.000Z	jpg_ny	gigel2007	or sniffing the network you mean then your host is not the problem
2008-11-08T06:30:00.000Z	jpg_ny	gigel2007	correct, cain and abel are usefull to crack windows password
2008-11-08T06:31:00.000Z	jpg_ny	gigel2007	it is not firewall but management interface
2008-11-08T06:32:00.000Z	jpg_ny	gigel2007	play with ufw there are some nice guide outhere

2008-11-08T06:51:00.000Z	gigel2007	jpg_ny	what if you have a program installed, and you download the .tar with the new version, if you make install, linux will know how to update it automatically or will it keep both versions ?
2008-11-08T06:52:00.000Z	jpg_ny	gigel2007	depends on how you install most likely will install a different version, the idea is to use a packagemanager to manage the package
2008-11-08T06:55:00.000Z	jpg_ny	gigel2007	yes if you use a package manager
2008-11-08T06:55:00.000Z	gigel2007	jpg_ny	do you have more documentation on how to use a package manager ?
