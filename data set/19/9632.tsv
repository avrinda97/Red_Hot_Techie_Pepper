2007-07-13T15:38:00.000Z	peeps		is anyone using a svn gui that they would recommend?
2007-07-13T15:38:00.000Z	tarzeau	peeps	i would wipe out all SVN software if i could
2007-07-13T15:38:00.000Z	peeps	tarzeau	? what's wrong with svn?
2007-07-13T15:39:00.000Z	tarzeau	peeps	too hard
2007-07-13T15:40:00.000Z	peeps	tarzeau	compared to CVS, it's a godsend
2007-07-13T15:40:00.000Z	tarzeau	peeps	i'd also wipe out all cvs :)
2007-07-13T15:40:00.000Z	tarzeau	peeps	and rcs, and bzr and anything like it
2007-07-13T15:40:00.000Z	peeps	tarzeau	and wtf would you use for version control?
2007-07-13T15:40:00.000Z	tarzeau	peeps	tarballs
2007-07-13T15:41:00.000Z	peeps	tarzeau	that's idiotic, i don't think you know how version control works.
2007-07-13T15:41:00.000Z	tarzeau	peeps	i know how it works, i just don't like it
2007-07-13T15:42:00.000Z	peeps	tarzeau	are you a software developer?
2007-07-13T15:42:00.000Z	tarzeau	peeps	yes
2007-07-13T15:42:00.000Z	tarzeau	peeps	and i know a few other software developers without svn/cvs...
2007-07-13T15:42:00.000Z	tarzeau	peeps	so you think someone can't develop software without those version control systems?
2007-07-13T15:43:00.000Z	peeps	tarzeau	they can, it's just not very smart, if they need to track revisions
2007-07-13T15:43:00.000Z	tarzeau	peeps	one can track revisions perfectly fine without cvs/svn...
2007-07-13T15:43:00.000Z	tarzeau	peeps	and it has nothing to do with smart or not
2007-07-13T15:44:00.000Z	tarzeau	peeps	or how they do is smart or not
