2009-03-22T04:22:00.000Z	Ramesses		what do you, guys, use to view "svgz" files? i'm trying to open one [from http://futurist.se/gldt/ ] with both gthumb and "eye of gnome" but to no avail
2009-03-22T04:24:00.000Z	Ramesses		*archive
2009-03-22T04:25:00.000Z	Ramesses		noone here succesfully opened a "svgz" file before? :|
2009-03-22T04:25:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Ramesses	what is it?
2009-03-22T04:27:00.000Z	Ramesses	gordonjcp	i said it before: "what do you, guys, use to view "svgz" files? i'm trying to open one [from http://futurist.se/gldt/ ] with both gthumb and "eye of gnome" but to no avail" & " i opened the "svgz" file with file archiver and it does list one file in the "archive" but it can't extract it"
2009-03-22T04:27:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Ramesses	a quick google suggests that it's a gzipped svg
2009-03-22T04:28:00.000Z	Ramesses	gordonjcp	care to READ what i said?
2009-03-22T04:28:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Ramesses	care to ditch the attitude?
2009-03-22T04:28:00.000Z	Ramesses	gordonjcp	just for you i'll repeat the third time: `i opened the "svgz" file with file archiver and it does list one file in the "archive" but it can't extract it`
2009-03-22T04:29:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Ramesses	well, maybe you're doing it wrong
2009-03-22T04:30:00.000Z	Ramesses	gordonjcp	wrong how? o opened it with the archiver [the fourth time i repeat it! ]; how can this be wrong?
2009-03-22T04:30:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Ramesses	an archiver probably isn't much good for viewing an svg file
2009-03-22T04:30:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Ramesses	come to that, neither is a bitmap viewer like EOG or gthumb
2009-03-22T04:32:00.000Z	Ramesses	gordonjcp	sorry mate but you must learn to read: i tried to OPEN that file in the archiver [if it's supposed to be an archive] and *it does list one file in the "archive" but it can't extract it*
2009-03-22T04:32:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Ramesses	you're not listening
2009-03-22T04:33:00.000Z	Ramesses	gordonjcp	sorry; i won't answear to you any longer
2009-03-22T04:33:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Ramesses	of course in this case the answer *is* available, and I've already pointed you in the right direction
2009-03-22T04:33:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Ramesses	a couple of people have actually *told* you what to do
2009-03-22T04:37:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Ramesses	opens just fine in Inkscape for me too
