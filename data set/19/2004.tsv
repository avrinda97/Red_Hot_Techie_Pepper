2010-08-01T13:25:00.000Z	frimend		I have troubles finding my newly created raid.
2010-08-01T13:25:00.000Z	frimend		I dont' see it as one disk.
2010-08-01T13:25:00.000Z	frimend		I see sdb and sdc, but they are both marked as unallocated space in gparted.
2010-08-01T13:25:00.000Z	frimend		and I can't mount them.
2010-08-01T13:26:00.000Z	jasonwryan	frimend	what does cat /proc/mdstat show?
2010-08-01T13:29:00.000Z	frimend	jasonwryan	cat /proc/mdstat show "unused devics <none>
2010-08-01T13:30:00.000Z	jasonwryan	frimend	no raid devices listed? you have no raid...
2010-08-01T13:30:00.000Z	jasonwryan	frimend	did you install from the alternate disk?
2010-08-01T13:31:00.000Z	frimend	jasonwryan	I installed ubuntu 10.04 on samsung disk.
2010-08-01T13:31:00.000Z	jasonwryan	frimend	to create a raid array, you need the alternate disk
2010-08-01T13:33:00.000Z	jasonwryan	frimend	you don't have a 'newly created raid' - it would show in mdstat if you did...
2010-08-01T13:36:00.000Z	jasonwryan	frimend	are you dual booting?
2010-08-01T13:37:00.000Z	jasonwryan	frimend	Ah! different thing entirely. IIRC, that is not so reliable for linux... You may want to google for details, but I think you will need the alternate disk
2010-08-01T13:38:00.000Z	jasonwryan	frimend	hardware raid is primarily built for windoze
2010-08-01T13:58:00.000Z	jasonwryan	frimend	RAID gives you _redundancy_, not speed...
2010-08-01T14:00:00.000Z	jasonwryan	frimend	really? where did you read that?
2010-08-01T14:00:00.000Z	jasonwryan	frimend	LOL!
2010-08-01T14:01:00.000Z	frimend	jasonwryan	I can't find any good source right now.
2010-08-01T14:02:00.000Z	jasonwryan	frimend	listen to TuxSax and CountDuckula
