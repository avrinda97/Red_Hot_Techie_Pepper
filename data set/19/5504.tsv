2008-11-16T04:53:00.000Z	JigmeDatse		I'd like to get gimp-print installed on my sister's Hardy computer, and it looks like it won't install, so I'm wondering if there's an alternative that provides similar functionality.
2008-11-16T04:54:00.000Z	JigmeDatse		I'm more a gentoo girl myself, but I thought Ubuntu would be easier for them to use.
2008-11-16T04:55:00.000Z	PriceChild	JigmeDatse	What do you mean by "won't install", what're you doing and what's the error?
2008-11-16T04:56:00.000Z	JigmeDatse	PriceChild	I'm not totally clear, but it looks like a dependency is missing, or gimp-print is completely missing.
2008-11-16T04:56:00.000Z	PriceChild	JigmeDatse	could so you're trying sudo apt-get install gimp-print ?/
2008-11-16T04:57:00.000Z	JigmeDatse	PriceChild	to get my sister to do so, yes.
2008-11-16T04:58:00.000Z	JigmeDatse	PriceChild	I think I could figure it out if I was infront of her computer, but it's a 12 hour drive away from me.
2008-11-16T04:58:00.000Z	PriceChild	JigmeDatse	There doesn't appear to be a package called gimp-print in Ubuntu.
2008-11-16T04:58:00.000Z	PriceChild	JigmeDatse	have you added a 3rd party repository and are trying to use that?
2008-11-16T04:59:00.000Z	JigmeDatse	PriceChild	I am not set on gimp-print, but it's what I'm using in Gentoo, and it does wonders for my printing.
2008-11-16T05:02:00.000Z	PriceChild	JigmeDatse	it might be that it just its available elsewhere *searches*
2008-11-16T05:03:00.000Z	JigmeDatse	PriceChild	kasutaja answered my question.  Thank you everyone.
2008-11-16T05:04:00.000Z	PriceChild	JigmeDatse	bah, they got there first, I was almost there :)
2008-11-16T05:05:00.000Z	JigmeDatse	PriceChild	doesn't matter to me who answers, or sometimes even if I get an *answer* but finding something that will let me figure it out is great.
2008-11-16T05:05:00.000Z	PriceChild	JigmeDatse	meh, but its always nice to accomplish something.
2008-11-16T05:06:00.000Z	JigmeDatse	PriceChild	you did.
2008-11-16T05:06:00.000Z	PriceChild	JigmeDatse	for future reference, even if you've not got ubuntu, you can search our packages on packages.ubuntu.com/<insert something here>
2008-11-16T05:06:00.000Z	JigmeDatse	PriceChild	yeah, I'm just not sure what to search for.
2008-11-16T05:07:00.000Z	PriceChild	JigmeDatse	i just did 'gimp', then used firefox to search for 'gimp-print' in the page, and found the renaming.
