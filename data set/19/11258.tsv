2008-02-09T12:08:00.000Z	rredd4		how do i transfer files from my pc (ubuntu 7.10) to my new macbook?
2008-02-09T12:10:00.000Z	rredd4		yes
2008-02-09T12:10:00.000Z	rredd4		no
2008-02-09T12:12:00.000Z	astro76	rredd4	you've installed openssh-server on the ubuntu machine?
2008-02-09T12:13:00.000Z	rredd4	astro76	not sure, but I have connected pc to pc via ssh
2008-02-09T12:14:00.000Z	astro76	rredd4	if you've ssh'd to it before then you have it
2008-02-09T12:15:00.000Z	rredd4	astro76	not sure why my password is not being accepted when I ssh from the mac.  When I go to terminal and sudo or root, password is accepted.
2008-02-09T12:15:00.000Z	rredd4	astro76	terminal on ubuntu pc
2008-02-09T12:16:00.000Z	astro76	rredd4	does this work on the ubuntu machine: ssh localhost
2008-02-09T12:17:00.000Z	rredd4	astro76	refused
2008-02-09T12:17:00.000Z	astro76	rredd4	ok so it seems the problem is definitely local to the ubuntu machine
2008-02-09T12:20:00.000Z	rredd4	astro76	how to fix?  when i type ssh localhost on the mac, connection refused also.  the mac connects to the pc, just won't accept password
2008-02-09T12:22:00.000Z	astro76	rredd4	have you edited /etd/ssh/ssh_config or added a ~/.ssh/config ?
2008-02-09T12:23:00.000Z	rredd4	astro76	no and don't know what to add
2008-02-09T12:23:00.000Z	astro76	rredd4	it should work with no changes, and you did say it worked before
2008-02-09T12:40:00.000Z	astro76	rredd4	and you can't ssh from the desktop pc to itself?
2008-02-09T12:40:00.000Z	astro76	rredd4	hrmm.. not sure
2008-02-09T12:40:00.000Z	rredd4	astro76	 ssh: connect to host localost port 22: Connection refused
2008-02-09T12:42:00.000Z	astro76	rredd4	oh.. have you messed with iptables or firestarter or otherwise added firewall rules ?
