2011-09-16T20:20:00.000Z	faryshta		Hi. How can I install 11.10 on a usb?
2011-09-16T20:22:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	faryshta	try unetbootin, i think there's a version for win
2011-09-16T20:23:00.000Z	faryshta	MonkeyDust	thanks I did but it got stucked in the 174 file.
2011-09-16T20:23:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	faryshta	maybe what you want is not possible
2011-09-16T20:24:00.000Z	faryshta	MonkeyDust	the iso are meant to be hybrid I think it should work but don't know how.

2011-12-14T18:45:00.000Z	faryshta	MonkeyDust	ActionParsnip thanks.
2011-12-14T18:51:00.000Z	faryshta	MonkeyDust	ActionParsnip I readed both articles. They are about the drivers but is it possible to play there?
2011-12-14T18:51:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	faryshta	 haven't tried, so can't tell
2011-12-14T18:52:00.000Z	faryshta	MonkeyDust	thanks.
2011-12-14T18:52:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	faryshta	 try it and you know, it makes you the expert - don't forget to backup your data, first, if you're afraid to ruin your system
2011-12-14T18:56:00.000Z	faryshta	MonkeyDust	I am asking about kinect games. Are there any games that run on ubuntu? I mean x-box games.

2012-06-04T23:22:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	faryshta	 did you consult this page? https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java#Oracle_Java_7
2012-06-04T23:26:00.000Z	faryshta	MonkeyDust	thanks for the link. But that is for installing, I need to UNinstall.
2012-06-04T23:32:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	faryshta	 look in synaptic for java, delete it and delete some hidden .config file, too, if needed, but be careful with that
2012-06-04T23:42:00.000Z	faryshta	MonkeyDust	that is what I am doing and where I receive the error. Synaptic is trowing this error every time I try to uninstall oracle-java7-installer
2012-06-04T23:58:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	faryshta	 try using a live cd or usb, work from there
2012-06-05T00:06:00.000Z	faryshta	MonkeyDust	why do I need a live cd or usb?
