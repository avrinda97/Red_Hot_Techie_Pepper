2006-06-17T09:13:00.000Z	puff		Okay, it's just now bringing up the desktop... I know it's an old machine (p400, 256MB ram) but this seems excessively slow...
2006-06-17T09:13:00.000Z	puff		Could there be something wrong?
2006-06-17T09:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	puff	 change to a lighter desktop like xfce.. or just a minimal window manager like icewm
2009-07-08T05:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	puff	 i hate that 'this folder contains....' bull.. :) its always wrong for me also.. and its NEVER actually handy when it is right.
2010-07-11T04:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	puff	 alt cd dosent have a gui.
2010-07-11T04:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	puff	 resize what exactly? You want to enlarge /home ?
2010-07-11T04:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	puff	 yep. 5gb is a little tight. BUT you could perhaps move  some dirs in / to be on /bulkdata and free up some space on the actual /
2010-07-11T04:51:00.000Z	puff	Dr_Willis	Nope, alreqady did all that.
2010-07-11T04:51:00.000Z	puff	Dr_Willis	And I'm still barely scraping by :-(
2010-07-11T04:52:00.000Z	puff	Dr_Willis	Yeah, it's the last of the original thinkpads, and they scream if you don't boot it iwth exactly the right hard drive model.
2010-07-11T04:52:00.000Z	puff	Dr_Willis	I even uninstalled the JDK package (because I've been doing java forever and I'm used to rollnig my own).
2010-07-11T04:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	puff	 you could resize home to how you want.. then reinstaall to the new /   but you alw3ays want to have backups
2010-07-11T04:54:00.000Z	puff	Dr_Willis	Well,that's my goal...  resize root, then reinstall to root, leave home and bulk untouched.
2010-07-11T04:54:00.000Z	puff	Dr_Willis	Er, untouched except for resizing them to free up space for root.
2010-07-11T04:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	puff	 if you just resize. i dont think the uuid's will change. But you may want to write down what UUID's each filesystgem is   befor and after you resize.
2010-07-11T04:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	puff	 you can change  the uuid's if you wanted. :)
2010-07-11T04:55:00.000Z	puff	Dr_Willis	Okay, I'm getting the feeling that a) this is something I should do when I have plenty of free time and b) maye I should just bite the bullet and reload from backup.
2010-07-11T04:55:00.000Z	puff	Dr_Willis	filesystgem?
2010-07-11T04:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	puff	 this is moar impormnatnt then females! :)
