2009-09-28T03:55:00.000Z	jrebeiro		hey there I'm having a weird hard disk problem. I am using lvm and one of the disks is throwing SMART errors. The drive is not detected in the BIOS but GRUB still loads from the MBR... seems odd to me.
2009-09-28T03:57:00.000Z	jrebeiro		and I installed GRUB on that disk
2009-09-28T03:58:00.000Z	jrebeiro		I bought a new hard drive and was going to clone the UUID to the new drive and just accept the data loss... but wanted to try to get some of the data back
2009-09-28T03:58:00.000Z	blz	jrebeiro	 dd_rescue is your friend
2009-09-28T03:59:00.000Z	jrebeiro	blz	yea.. but that drive isn't detected at all by ubuntu
2009-09-28T04:10:00.000Z	jrebeiro	blz	yea.. symantec ghost ;)
2009-09-28T04:10:00.000Z	jrebeiro	blz	hrmm... never used dd_rescue.. I'll check it out
2009-09-28T04:11:00.000Z	blz	jrebeiro	 yeah that's more like symantec ghost
2009-09-28T04:29:00.000Z	jrebeiro	blz	is there a package for dd_rescue
2009-09-28T04:29:00.000Z	blz	jrebeiro	 hmmi thought there was... i'm sure you can find isntructions on google
2009-09-28T04:31:00.000Z	jrebeiro	blz	ok.. compiled it.. hopefully it works
2009-09-28T04:33:00.000Z	jrebeiro	blz	dd_rescue can't read a single block
2009-09-28T04:34:00.000Z	blz	jrebeiro	 maybe it's a physical failure?
2009-09-28T04:34:00.000Z	jrebeiro	blz	well.. I'm sure it is since it threw a SMART error
2009-09-28T04:35:00.000Z	blz	jrebeiro	 you're sure it is a physical failure?
2009-09-28T04:36:00.000Z	jrebeiro	blz	well here is what happened... I tried mounting a AFP share off the server and it died. the box pinged so I tried SSH'ing to it and the connection closed immediately.. I thought that was odd so I threw a monitor on it and saw the screen flooded with IO Errors.. I couldn't type a single character they were flying by so fast
2009-09-28T04:37:00.000Z	blz	jrebeiro	 hmmm... afaik that doesn't rule out the possibility of a phsyical problem like a head crash.  the drive spins up and everything, I assume?
2009-09-28T04:37:00.000Z	jrebeiro	blz	yes.. and remember.. GRUB loads off one of the partitions
2009-09-28T04:38:00.000Z	blz	jrebeiro	 hmm... then the plot thickens...
