2006-08-19T10:57:00.000Z	bruenig	wheels3572	there are a few alarm clocks that work on media players as well
2006-08-19T10:58:00.000Z	wheels3572	bruenig	really?  So there is an alarm clock program on some of the media players?
2006-08-19T10:59:00.000Z	bruenig	wheels3572	those two that I posted sanduhr and wmtimer, as well as things like xmms-alarm and bmp-alarm
2006-08-19T11:00:00.000Z	wheels3572	bruenig	I have xmms music player is that different then xmms-alarm?
2006-08-19T11:00:00.000Z	bruenig	wheels3572	xmms-alarm is a plugin
2006-08-19T11:05:00.000Z	wheels3572	bruenig	Only 1 dumb question how the heck do I use the alarm system now lol
2006-08-19T11:05:00.000Z	bruenig	wheels3572	no idea, probably something within xmms, go to options or whatever the proper dialogue window is in xmms. I have never used it
2006-08-19T11:06:00.000Z	wheels3572	bruenig	ok
2006-12-31T07:45:00.000Z	bruenig	wheels3572	right click on the panel and add to it
2006-12-31T07:45:00.000Z	bruenig	wheels3572	and then get the volume applet
2007-02-25T10:46:00.000Z	bruenig	wheels3572	yeah I noticed that on xfce too, it is sketchy. Luckily I keep the desktop clean so it doesn't matter.
2007-02-25T10:47:00.000Z	wheels3572	bruenig	so you cant save either to the desktop
2007-02-25T10:48:00.000Z	bruenig	wheels3572	I can save to the desktop, but it doesn't show up on the desktop, it does show up in thunar on the desktop and in the terminal on the desktop too. You can activate the desktop though, it just comes undone and is tiresome. Go to Applications>settings>desktop settings and allow xfce to manage desktop
2007-02-25T10:51:00.000Z	wheels3572	bruenig	ok gotcha :)
2007-03-06T07:59:00.000Z	bruenig	wheels3572	./configure is you running the script, make come sin build-essential
2007-03-06T08:01:00.000Z	bruenig	wheels3572	that is already compiled, all you do is extract it and run the firefox script to launch firefox
2007-03-06T08:01:00.000Z	wheels3572	bruenig	how would I do that.
2007-03-06T08:02:00.000Z	bruenig	wheels3572	go into the directory and double click the script that says firefox
2007-03-06T08:02:00.000Z	wheels3572	bruenig	ok
