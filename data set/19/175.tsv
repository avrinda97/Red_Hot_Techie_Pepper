2012-07-18T21:06:00.000Z	jacta		Anyone knows a tool to make .ogv to .mov?
2012-07-18T21:08:00.000Z	jacta		Ztane, cause I just recordmydesktop - but the one who need the files need it in mov format
2012-07-18T21:10:00.000Z	jacta		Ill give it a shot, gsr, thanks!
2012-07-18T21:11:00.000Z	zteam	jacta	very well try winff and see if that does the job for ya :-)
2012-07-18T21:16:00.000Z	zteam	jacta	hmm... maybe it does not support .mov
2012-07-18T21:16:00.000Z	jacta	zteam	but the ss from the homepage shows Quicktime :/
2012-07-18T21:19:00.000Z	zteam	jacta	do you have libavcodec-extra-53 installed?
2012-07-18T21:19:00.000Z	jacta	zteam	nop - trying
2012-07-18T21:20:00.000Z	zteam	jacta	that should install some extra codecs for you
2012-07-18T21:20:00.000Z	jacta	zteam	it also did, but not quicktime - just saw - flv or mov is the format I need :\
2012-07-18T21:22:00.000Z	zteam	jacta	okey, well u can try iriverter instead
2012-07-18T21:23:00.000Z	zteam	jacta	otherwise there are plenty of web pages which offer video conversation online
2012-07-18T21:24:00.000Z	jacta	zteam	file will be around 130mb of not more :\
2012-07-18T21:26:00.000Z	zteam	jacta	yeah do so, is this file going to watched on ipad/iphone or an Ipod?
2012-07-18T21:26:00.000Z	jacta	zteam	its for a client - dunno what they use it for :p
2012-07-18T21:27:00.000Z	zteam	jacta	okey, just wondered why they did prefer .mov format :-)
2012-07-18T21:31:00.000Z	zteam	jacta	yeah try VLC as mneptok suggests that should be able to convert it
2012-07-18T21:31:00.000Z	jacta	zteam	- mneptok but what format?
2012-07-18T21:37:00.000Z	zteam	jacta	yes it is avaiable, click on the hammer and u should have alot of more options
