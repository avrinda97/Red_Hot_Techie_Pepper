2008-09-06T22:05:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	arvind_khadri	ill correct you for your sake.  SMP is used for multiple cpus,  i686 is 32bit
2008-09-06T22:05:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	danbh_intrepid	ya got the fact right abt SMP now had confused sorry :S
2008-09-06T22:06:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	danbh_intrepid	sorry
2008-09-06T22:06:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	arvind_khadri	np
2008-09-24T21:43:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	arvind_khadri	I thought that directive was to get LESS questions
2008-09-24T21:43:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	danbh_intrepid	pcritical for less ones :)
2008-09-24T21:44:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	arvind_khadri	I dont get it
2008-09-24T21:44:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	danbh_intrepid	instead of -phigh if you use -pcritical no questions would be asked...
2008-09-24T21:45:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	arvind_khadri	ah, I get it, but still, -phigh asks less questions than the default I thought.  -plow asks the most questions
2008-09-24T21:46:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	danbh_intrepid	the last time i used it i was bugged up with the number of questions
2008-09-27T09:10:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	arvind_khadri	actually, now that command  has a protection built in.  It requires an additional flag to actually execute...  Which I guess makes it safer, but then people can just post with the additional flag...
2008-09-27T09:12:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	danbh_intrepid	 hmm ...
2008-09-27T09:12:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	arvind_khadri	nix that last comment, I just remembered, it only works if the target is /, not /*
2008-09-27T09:13:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	danbh_intrepid	but according to  r.e that should work :)
2008-09-27T09:14:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	arvind_khadri	whats r.e?
2008-09-27T09:14:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	danbh_intrepid	regular expressions :)
2008-09-27T09:17:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	arvind_khadri	I think it does do damage, because /* expands to a directory listing.  But, (this is getting ot btw), rm will refuse to operate on /.  But once you get the expanded listing, that layer of protection is worked around,  anyway, I don't really know
2008-09-27T09:17:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	danbh_intrepid	lets continue this on #ubuntu-ot
