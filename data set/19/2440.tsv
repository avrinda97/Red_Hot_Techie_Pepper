2010-09-05T14:12:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499		oh ya btw when I start to run alot of apps together on my netbook my system freezes/crashes  even though the applications don't take up all the ram and I have to hard reboot it anyone know why ?
2010-09-05T14:13:00.000Z	digim0nk	ShapeShifter499	could be u dont have enough swap
2010-09-05T14:14:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499	digim0nk	I thought that too but I checked and my usb install(installed to computer mem from usb) partitioned in 3 gigs of swap
2010-09-05T14:16:00.000Z	digim0nk	ShapeShifter499	strange .. 3gigs shoud be more than enough .. updated your kernel .. try booting off the earlier one
2010-09-05T14:17:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499	digim0nk	but when I have system monitor up it shows that right before crashing I'm only using about 300mb of a gig of ram
2010-09-05T14:17:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499		it did this on the newest version and the one the system came installed with
2010-09-05T14:18:00.000Z	digim0nk	ShapeShifter499	are using multiple firefox windows
2010-09-05T14:18:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499		its scares me when it does that
2010-09-05T14:18:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499		no
2010-09-05T14:19:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499		and if it crashes while playing music it will repeat the last few seconds like a vinyl does when it skips

2010-09-05T14:23:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499	digim0nk	no I don't use one
2010-09-05T14:23:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499	digim0nk	and it freezes sometimes while I'm actively using it
2010-09-05T14:26:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499	digim0nk	and I use this for school and stuff and even though it hasen't happened I'm worried that it will messing up my workflow and costing me time to reboot. also I'm worried of loosing files
