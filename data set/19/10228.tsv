2008-09-09T10:10:00.000Z	chalcedony		if xsane is missing the help file AND won't open with the full screen on the preview window, and only scans about 40% of the page.. would a fresh install help ? and can someone walk me through doing that please? (adult wih learning disabilities)
2008-09-09T10:12:00.000Z	chalcedony		sigh
2008-09-09T10:12:00.000Z	chalcedony		there is really not much out there about a broken xsane
2008-09-09T10:12:00.000Z	chalcedony		how to un-stall it?
2008-09-09T10:13:00.000Z	Gun_Smoke	chalcedony	is this your first attempt with xsane? or was it working before?
2008-09-09T10:13:00.000Z	chalcedony	Gun_Smoke	it always worked... sometimes the preview window vanished but it's always worked even when i can't print
2008-09-09T10:16:00.000Z	Gun_Smoke	chalcedony	well I guess you could try to remove and reinstall.. sudo apt-get remove xsane && sudo apt-get install xsane
2008-09-09T10:17:00.000Z	chalcedony	Gun_Smoke	before i bite the bullet will i have to tell it how to find the printer again?
2008-09-09T10:18:00.000Z	Gun_Smoke	chalcedony	yeah it should, it isn't messing with your printer.. It's just an app.  You could also try scanning through gimp
2008-09-09T10:19:00.000Z	chalcedony	Gun_Smoke	so just replacing xsane should work-work ?
2008-09-09T10:20:00.000Z	Gun_Smoke	chalcedony	I can't say for sure.. It's worth a try.
2008-09-09T10:21:00.000Z	Gun_Smoke	chalcedony	give it a go?
2008-09-09T10:21:00.000Z	chalcedony	Gun_Smoke	yes i guess so ty :)
2008-09-09T10:21:00.000Z	Gun_Smoke	chalcedony	should only take a minute or two
2008-09-09T10:22:00.000Z	chalcedony	Gun_Smoke	i love command line :)
2008-09-09T10:22:00.000Z	chalcedony	Gun_Smoke	yes!!
