2007-10-25T05:30:00.000Z	dark_valkyrian		guys, may i get some help configuring a debian server?
2007-10-25T05:31:00.000Z	dark_valkyrian		i installed debian etch in a 2,8 gb disk plugged to a AMD athlon (the disk is from a pentium mmx)
2007-10-25T05:31:00.000Z	dark_valkyrian		the problem is that now that i plugged it back to its genuine hardware it doesnt recognize the 2 NICs
2007-10-25T05:31:00.000Z	dark_valkyrian		what can i do?
2007-10-25T05:32:00.000Z	wastrel	dark_valkyrian	check /etc/iftab
2007-10-25T05:33:00.000Z	dark_valkyrian	wastrel	just lemme reboot it again
2007-10-25T05:36:00.000Z	dark_valkyrian	wastrel	you said /etc/iftab? i dont seem to have that file
2007-10-25T05:37:00.000Z	wastrel	dark_valkyrian	i thought it might be the prob because the mac address of your network cards can be stored there, you moved the drive so you have different network cards
2007-10-25T05:38:00.000Z	dark_valkyrian	wastrel	so what can i do? unplug the nics and plug them again?
2007-10-25T05:39:00.000Z	wastrel	dark_valkyrian	 do you see them in lspci?  are they active in the BIOS?  what kernel modules support them?  maybe you just need to load the proper drivers
2007-10-25T05:40:00.000Z	dark_valkyrian	wastrel	yeah i can see them both with lspci
2007-10-25T05:46:00.000Z	dark_valkyrian	wastrel	r u there?
2007-10-25T05:47:00.000Z	wastrel	dark_valkyrian	yeah did you find the drivers you need?
2007-10-25T05:48:00.000Z	dark_valkyrian	wastrel	i have no way to copy the drivers to the server
2007-10-25T05:49:00.000Z	wastrel	dark_valkyrian	you need to figure out what kernel module supports the hardware you're using.  then load the module
2007-10-25T05:49:00.000Z	dark_valkyrian	wastrel	i see, just googling?
2007-10-25T05:49:00.000Z	dark_valkyrian	wastrel	once i find them i load the modules with modprobe right?
2007-10-25T05:49:00.000Z	wastrel	dark_valkyrian	there's probably a better way but yeah :]
2007-10-25T05:50:00.000Z	dark_valkyrian	wastrel	cool thanks a lot for your help :D
