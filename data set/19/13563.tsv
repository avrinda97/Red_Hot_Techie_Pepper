2005-03-08T08:02:00.000Z	sigglet	tuxdisciple	if you have money
2005-03-08T08:03:00.000Z	tuxdisciple	sigglet	Yeah, hence we were discussing CentOS
2005-03-08T08:03:00.000Z	tuxdisciple	sigglet	Also a good alternative, I like CentOS more for some subconscious reason
2005-03-08T08:05:00.000Z	sigglet	tuxdisciple	why run rhel when there is http://whiteboxlinux.org/
2005-03-08T08:05:00.000Z	tuxdisciple	sigglet	I use CentOS...
2005-03-08T08:06:00.000Z	tuxdisciple	sigglet	Managers like knowing there is support available in case my contract is over
2005-03-08T08:06:00.000Z	tuxdisciple	sigglet	Management decision, I'm a consultant :)
2005-03-08T08:07:00.000Z	tuxdisciple	sigglet	My point, is I am a consultant... and when a client wants a system they can support without my services forever, they want a VENDOR who will support it.
2005-03-08T08:08:00.000Z	sigglet	tuxdisciple	so have you looked into freebsd then?
2005-03-08T08:08:00.000Z	tuxdisciple	sigglet	FreeBSD is not a Vendor... i
2005-03-08T08:08:00.000Z	tuxdisciple	sigglet	So it doesn't really address the issue does it?
2005-03-08T08:09:00.000Z	tuxdisciple	sigglet	I'm not saying RH is better techincally... but from a business perspective... ...
2005-03-08T08:09:00.000Z	tuxdisciple	sigglet	see what skel_home said :)
2005-03-08T08:10:00.000Z	tuxdisciple	sigglet	* I * don't use it personally, I understand what you are saying...
2005-03-08T08:10:00.000Z	sigglet	tuxdisciple	yes I see... but why choose RH when there are several others such as SuSE? just curious? is it cost?
2005-03-08T08:10:00.000Z	tuxdisciple	sigglet	SuSE is always presented as an option... U.S. Companies gravitate towards RH mostly
2005-03-08T08:11:00.000Z	tuxdisciple	sigglet	It tends to have bigger mindshare in the U.S. I actually like SuSE more
2005-03-08T08:11:00.000Z	tuxdisciple	sigglet	You'd have to check their P/E ratios etc... I don't track their stocks
2005-03-08T08:16:00.000Z	tuxdisciple	sigglet	That's.... such a difficult mental picture...
