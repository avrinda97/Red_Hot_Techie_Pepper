2012-02-05T01:12:00.000Z	kapz		does anyone know to install a setup.py file?
2012-02-05T01:13:00.000Z	theadmin	kapz	Normally, "sudo ./setup.py install"
2012-02-09T19:09:00.000Z	theadmin	kapz	Try screenlets
2012-02-09T19:09:00.000Z	theadmin	kapz	Or conky maybe
2012-02-10T20:47:00.000Z	theadmin	kapz	Well this shows you have 4G
2012-02-10T20:56:00.000Z	theadmin	kapz	You want Left Shift, not Escape (they changed it since grub2)
2012-02-22T12:49:00.000Z	theadmin	kapz	#android
2012-02-22T12:50:00.000Z	kapz	theadmin	I get this message when joining ":Cannot join channel (+r) - you need to be identified with services"
2012-02-22T12:50:00.000Z	theadmin	kapz	Well, you need to be identified with services... Register your nickname
2012-02-29T19:17:00.000Z	theadmin	kapz	smplayer is pretty cool, but I don't think it works with remote filesystems
2012-02-29T19:18:00.000Z	theadmin	kapz	Actually, try "Open URL" in smplayer (ctrl-u)
2012-02-29T19:48:00.000Z	kapz	theadmin	VLC gives the output: http://pastebin.com/4PYSJpDf
2012-02-29T19:48:00.000Z	theadmin	kapz	Needs the password...
2012-02-29T19:49:00.000Z	kapz	theadmin	it does not ask for a password
2012-02-29T19:49:00.000Z	theadmin	kapz	Doesn't mean it doesn't need it
2012-02-29T19:50:00.000Z	kapz	theadmin	I meant to ask where do I put the password?
2012-02-29T19:50:00.000Z	theadmin	kapz	You likely can't use protected streams with it
2012-02-29T19:50:00.000Z	theadmin	kapz	Though you can try it in the form of ftp://user:password@ftp.example.org
2012-02-29T19:50:00.000Z	kapz	theadmin	oh ok...will give it a try and see what happens...thanks anyway. :)
