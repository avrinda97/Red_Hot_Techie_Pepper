2009-03-04T12:57:00.000Z	Zta		The ubuntu 7.04 (feisty) archive seems to have disappeared.  Where can I find it.
2009-03-04T12:58:00.000Z	Zta		There's a difference between "not supporting" and "sabotaging".  I need some 7.04 packages.
2009-03-04T12:59:00.000Z	Zta		Anyone know where I can find a 7.04 repo?
2009-03-04T12:59:00.000Z	Daft_Punk	Zta	a mirror perhaps?
2009-03-04T13:00:00.000Z	Zta	Daft_Punk	I was actually hoping the official archive.ubuntu.com would keep them =\
2009-03-04T13:02:00.000Z	Daft_Punk	Zta	no, they wouldnt keep them, its like microsoft not selling obsolete software anymore, ubuntu wont keep obsolete software either, you can check a torrent or mirror site if you want an older version that is no longer supported
2009-03-04T13:03:00.000Z	Zta	Daft_Punk	That's a crappy policy.  So Ubuntu basically forces people upgrade their computers.  This takes time and costs money, and is unnecessary if the server runs fine.  Who's going to pay for this?  Ubuntu?
2009-03-04T13:03:00.000Z	Daft_Punk	Zta	ubuntu is free
2009-03-04T13:04:00.000Z	Zta	Daft_Punk	you don't get my point
2009-03-04T13:05:00.000Z	Daft_Punk	Zta	hippie if you want ubuntu 7.04 you can download it off a mirror or torrent
2009-03-04T13:06:00.000Z	Daft_Punk	Zta	http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/releases/feisty/
2009-03-04T13:06:00.000Z	Zta	Daft_Punk	I got that.
2009-03-04T13:06:00.000Z	Daft_Punk	Zta	ok so what is the problem?
2009-03-04T13:06:00.000Z	Zta	Daft_Punk	I'm just trying to get my point though to you =)
2009-03-04T13:07:00.000Z	Daft_Punk	Zta	as far as I understand, you asked a question, you got the resolution you required, and you are trying to banter because of principle?
2009-03-04T13:08:00.000Z	Daft_Punk	Zta	there are no latest patches/upgrades for that OS, it is dead.
2009-03-04T13:09:00.000Z	Zta	Daft_Punk	There's *always* a latest packages.
2009-03-04T13:09:00.000Z	Daft_Punk	Zta	not in the repos or synaptic, you would have to compile it yourself
2009-03-04T13:10:00.000Z	Zta	Daft_Punk	I'm not talking about the software developers latest version -- I'm talking about the latest version Ubuntu released.
