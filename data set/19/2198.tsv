2010-05-31T02:17:00.000Z	AlikeYou		hi all
2010-05-31T02:18:00.000Z	AlikeYou		can anybody help me with sound driver?
2010-05-31T02:18:00.000Z	royceremer	AlikeYou	sure, you're not running alsa? or pulse? or did you install a new sound card?
2010-05-31T02:20:00.000Z	AlikeYou	royceremer	The audio controller is 'intel 82801 AC'97', installed Alsa 1.0.23 without any problem, but when i running any progrum (aplay or mocp): cannot find card '0' and 'Unknown pcm default' error
2010-05-31T02:21:00.000Z	royceremer	AlikeYou	installed alsa? what kernel are you running? $ uname -r
2010-05-31T02:21:00.000Z	royceremer	AlikeYou	alsa is pretty standard, so having to install it is strange
2010-05-31T02:22:00.000Z	AlikeYou	royceremer	ubuntu 9.10 server, 2.6.31-14
2010-05-31T02:23:00.000Z	royceremer	AlikeYou	interesting, I thought karmic server had alsa preinstalled, but I guess that didn't expect you would need sound for a server :)
2010-05-31T02:24:00.000Z	royceremer	AlikeYou	one sec, ttrying to lookup what all drivers you'll need install
2010-05-31T02:25:00.000Z	royceremer	AlikeYou	for sure libasound2, probably linux_soundbase
2010-05-31T02:27:00.000Z	AlikeYou	royceremer	hmm.. libasound2 is installed, but linux_soundbase not found in apt
2010-05-31T02:28:00.000Z	royceremer	AlikeYou	karmic and above it's "libsndfile1"
2010-05-31T02:29:00.000Z	royceremer	AlikeYou	$ sudo apt-get install --reinstall libasound2 libsndfile1 alsa-utils alsamixer
2010-05-31T02:29:00.000Z	royceremer	AlikeYou	or something like that...
2010-05-31T02:30:00.000Z	AlikeYou	royceremer	it's too installed... i'll try to reinstall alsa.. thanks for help
2010-05-31T02:30:00.000Z	royceremer	AlikeYou	no worries, good luck
2010-05-31T02:30:00.000Z	royceremer	AlikeYou	there's a nice alsa shell troubleshooting script that might help too
2010-05-31T02:30:00.000Z	royceremer	AlikeYou	let me find it
2010-05-31T02:32:00.000Z	royceremer	AlikeYou	not the script I was looking for, but basic sound troublehsooting nonetheless: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshooting
