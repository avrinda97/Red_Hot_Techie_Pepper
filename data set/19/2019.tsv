2010-09-16T00:00:00.000Z	b0ot		Can I use cron to have a few simple bash scripts start as root when my computer boots?
2010-09-16T00:00:00.000Z	llutz	b0ot	you can use cron or just /etc/rc.local
2010-09-16T00:02:00.000Z	llutz	b0ot	add you scripts to /etc/rc.local  before "exit 0"
2010-09-16T00:03:00.000Z	b0ot	llutz	erUSUL how would i get the scripts to run as root with this method?
2010-09-16T00:03:00.000Z	llutz	b0ot	they will be run as root
2010-09-16T00:04:00.000Z	llutz	b0ot	exactly
2010-09-16T00:12:00.000Z	b0ot	llutz	it doesn't seem to work
2010-09-16T00:12:00.000Z	llutz	b0ot	given correct pathes? scripts are working from commandline?
2010-09-16T00:13:00.000Z	b0ot	llutz	yeah
2010-09-16T00:13:00.000Z	llutz	b0ot	sure you added your scripts before "exit 0" line?
2010-09-16T00:14:00.000Z	llutz	b0ot	what shall the scripts do?
2010-09-16T00:14:00.000Z	b0ot	llutz	they start cameras on my network, and then they stream them
2010-09-16T00:15:00.000Z	llutz	b0ot	use full pathes inside your scripts, rclocal is run with limited environment
2010-09-16T00:16:00.000Z	b0ot	llutz	i have been using full paths
2011-02-22T20:26:00.000Z	b0ot	llutz	will those allow my to copy back and forth from harddrives of different sizes?
2011-07-06T21:58:00.000Z	llutz	b0ot	ethtool -s eth0 autoneg off duplex full speed 100
2011-07-06T21:59:00.000Z	b0ot	llutz	I tried that and it won't take
2011-07-06T22:00:00.000Z	b0ot	llutz	nvm
