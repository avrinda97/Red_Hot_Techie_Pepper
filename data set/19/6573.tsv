2008-01-15T10:50:00.000Z	Michael74	akorn	so the monitor works until you watch a movie?
2008-01-15T10:50:00.000Z	akorn	Michael74	it works for movies too...what i mean is any screen that i try to fullscreen ( used movie as an example, but even this screen) won't entirely full screen
2008-01-15T10:51:00.000Z	Michael74	akorn	try disabling compiz like MasterShrek said I think it will help
2008-01-15T10:52:00.000Z	akorn	Michael74	MasterShrek yea it works when i disable compiz...i kind of want a solution though not a work around :)
2008-01-15T10:53:00.000Z	Michael74	akorn	try installed compiz fussion it might be the better one
2008-01-15T10:53:00.000Z	akorn	Michael74	just did that :)
2008-01-15T10:54:00.000Z	Michael74	akorn	and....... does it work correctly?
2008-01-15T10:54:00.000Z	akorn	Michael74	i mean i just did that the other day haha
2008-01-15T10:54:00.000Z	akorn	Michael74	it did fix video problems though...i used to have to turn off compiz to watch a movie because the movie would come out choppy otherwise, now it runs perfectly for that
2008-01-15T10:57:00.000Z	akorn	Michael74	this is weird, but if instead of double-clicking to maximize my window, i click the maximize button at the top right, it full screens
