2007-03-20T15:34:00.000Z	Smotang		antivirus linux?!?
2007-03-20T15:34:00.000Z	Smotang		I/O errors on a DVD how do I retrieve the data from the disk? I really need the info as it is from a project that I have been working on.
2007-03-20T15:34:00.000Z	soundray	Smotang	try another drive or a cleaning CD
2007-03-20T16:16:00.000Z	soundray	Smotang	also consider spending some time with cli:
2007-03-20T05:33:00.000Z	soundray	Smotang	there's no point repeating the question at short intervals if nobody knows the answer
2007-03-20T05:34:00.000Z	Smotang	soundray	sorry
2007-03-20T05:36:00.000Z	soundray	Smotang	spend some time with 'man dd'. I guess you have to skip or seek into the file, creating several partial copies and reassemble them with cat
2007-03-20T05:37:00.000Z	Smotang	soundray	how do I seek into the file?
2007-03-20T05:38:00.000Z	soundray	Smotang	man dd
2007-03-20T05:38:00.000Z	Smotang	soundray	thanks I cant believe I missed that there :(
2007-03-20T05:40:00.000Z	Smotang	soundray	Yeah that should do the trick, I cant believe that noone has made a gui for this yet O.o I Imagine alot of avid anime sharing fans and the like would be unbelievably hungry for this kind of thing.
2007-03-20T05:41:00.000Z	soundray	Smotang	feel free :)
2007-03-20T05:49:00.000Z	soundray	Smotang	no, cat item1.avi item2.avi >endproduct.avi
2007-03-20T05:49:00.000Z	Smotang	soundray	thanks
2007-03-20T05:49:00.000Z	soundray	Smotang	you can cat as many fragments as you like
2007-03-20T05:50:00.000Z	Smotang	soundray	I think I tried that it just went down one line (its what I would do in windows cmd) does it take a while or is it instant? also using ctrl b (break) is that a bad thing to do all the time in linux?
2007-03-20T05:51:00.000Z	soundray	Smotang	it returns to the prompt when it's done the job
2007-03-20T05:57:00.000Z	soundray	Smotang	I don't think so
2007-03-20T05:58:00.000Z	soundray	Smotang	you have to use something like 'for i in /source/* ; do dd if=$i of=/target/$i ; done'
