2009-03-25T03:59:00.000Z	g4lt-lappy	Zedde	do you often do what a webpage recommends without understanding what it's asking?
2009-03-25T04:00:00.000Z	g4lt-lappy	Zedde	yeah, but you conveniently forgot to tell US what you need to do

2009-03-25T04:03:00.000Z	g4lt-lappy	Zedde	good news/bad news.  ther's a bug on it.  investigating
2009-03-25T04:05:00.000Z	g4lt-lappy	Zedde	A newer kernel (2.6.27-2-generic, latest from intrepid) now detects the device without any changes being required to option.c or any explicit forcing of module loading.
2009-03-25T04:07:00.000Z	g4lt-lappy	Zedde	still, uname -a to be sure, and did you reboot?
2009-03-25T04:11:00.000Z	Zedde	g4lt-lappy	Hmm  I feel abit stupid , haven't that on my system
2009-03-25T04:11:00.000Z	g4lt-lappy	Zedde	you do, it's the networking icon on the taskbar
2009-03-25T04:13:00.000Z	Zedde	g4lt-lappy	I guesst that
2009-03-25T04:14:00.000Z	Zedde	g4lt-lappy	will do
2009-03-25T04:14:00.000Z	Zedde	g4lt-lappy	thanks
2009-03-25T04:15:00.000Z	g4lt-lappy	Zedde	not all the time, just for now to prove everything's working
2009-03-25T04:15:00.000Z	Zedde	g4lt-lappy	I understand will test it :) I gues apt-get install x ?
2009-03-25T04:16:00.000Z	g4lt-lappy	Zedde	not really, ubuintu is pretty much going to have X unless you specifically uninstalled it
2009-03-25T04:16:00.000Z	Zedde	g4lt-lappy	installed a server ED
