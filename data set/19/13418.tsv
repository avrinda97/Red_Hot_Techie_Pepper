2006-07-28T07:21:00.000Z	swim		hmm having issues with frostwire (and limewire) when I try to run them I get this (from console): http://www.bigbold.com/snippets/posts/show/2333
2006-07-28T07:21:00.000Z	swim		I've installed the latest java following the ubuntu wiki
2006-07-28T07:21:00.000Z	synic	swim	got java installed?
2006-07-28T07:22:00.000Z	synic	swim	if you type "java -version
2006-07-28T07:22:00.000Z	swim	synic	I followed the wiki to the letter, and according to those errors it does find it in the paths
2006-07-28T07:22:00.000Z	swim	synic	huh thats bizarre, it returns: java version "1.4.2"
2006-07-28T07:22:00.000Z	synic	swim	it might be finding gjc or whatever
2006-07-28T07:23:00.000Z	synic	swim	what does echo $JAVA_HOME say?
2006-07-28T07:24:00.000Z	swim	synic	nothing, but I also had installed the latest java so it should show version 1.5x as far as I know
2006-07-28T07:24:00.000Z	synic	swim	where did you install 1.5 ?
2006-07-28T07:24:00.000Z	swim	synic	its an ubuntu package... so whereever it wanted to
2006-07-28T07:25:00.000Z	synic	swim	I'd find it and set JAVA_HOME to that place.  Maybe /usr/lib/jdk1.5* or something
2006-07-28T07:29:00.000Z	swim	synic	I uninstalled the gjc and i can run those programs now... should that be an ok thing to do btw?
2006-07-28T07:29:00.000Z	synic	swim	yeah, gcj is a piece of crap
2006-07-28T07:29:00.000Z	synic	swim	:)  you the same guy with a creative media player?
2006-07-28T07:30:00.000Z	swim	synic	I was until I dropped it for the 30th time :P now I'm suffering with an ipod (can't stand it)
2006-07-28T07:30:00.000Z	synic	swim	I got an ipod too.  I absolutely love it.
2006-07-28T07:30:00.000Z	synic	swim	someone broke into my car and stole my creative.
2006-07-28T07:31:00.000Z	swim	synic	aww sucky
