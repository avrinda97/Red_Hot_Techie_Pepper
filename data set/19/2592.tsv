2010-02-24T12:50:00.000Z	Jordan_U	learst	np, you can also "export VARIABLE" to make it available to any commands you start from that shell.
2010-02-24T12:53:00.000Z	learst	Jordan_U	sorry u lost me there. I don't really know much bout programming. Still not fully sure what are things like shell, bash command etc
2010-02-24T12:55:00.000Z	Jordan_U	learst	What is the program you are trying to run?
2010-02-24T12:56:00.000Z	learst	Jordan_U	a multiple alignment programme - dialign2. Heres' the instructions for installation:   to run DIALIGN2, you must create an environment variable `DIALIGN2_DIR' pointing to the directory `dialign2_dir'
2010-02-24T12:59:00.000Z	learst	Jordan_U	btw I've transfered the executable part of the progamme  (dialign2-2) to the bin folder
2010-02-24T13:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	learst	Take a look at the "emboss" package.
2010-02-24T13:02:00.000Z	learst	Jordan_U	oh. ok i'll try looking for it. for some reason emboss sounds really familiar. :)
2010-02-24T13:03:00.000Z	Jordan_U	learst	Do you know about the package manager?
2010-02-24T13:03:00.000Z	learst	Jordan_U	i think so. it's the synaptic package manager right
2010-02-24T13:03:00.000Z	Jordan_U	learst	Yes
2010-02-24T13:06:00.000Z	learst	Jordan_U	ok, downloading EMBOSS now. No wonder it sounded familiar. Are u doing bioinformatics too? :P
2010-02-24T13:06:00.000Z	Jordan_U	learst	No, I just searched in apt :)
2010-02-24T13:07:00.000Z	learst	Jordan_U	apt?
2010-02-24T13:08:00.000Z	Jordan_U	learst	Synaptic is a GUI front end for a set of commands ( apt-file, apt-cache, apt-get ).
2010-02-24T13:09:00.000Z	learst	Jordan_U	oh ok. thanks a lot for being patient and explaining stuff to me. thought it doesn't seem to be downloading though. maybe i'll try again later.
