2012-01-29T05:23:00.000Z	sandy		Could someone please tell me what the program name is that handles "Sound Preferences" located on the Ubuntu toobar speaker icon. Thank you for your thoughtful answers.
2012-01-29T05:24:00.000Z	markyxxxz	sandy	Try running it and at the same time type ps aux from the terminal. You should see it ther, most likely it starts with gnome-*
2012-01-29T05:27:00.000Z	sandy	markyxxxz	Thank you very much I will try that :-)
2012-01-29T05:28:00.000Z	markyxxxz	sandy	YW. Make sure you don't have a lot of running apps or  the one you'r looking for might get lost. The name should be easy to spot enough.
2012-01-29T05:28:00.000Z	sandy	markyxxxz	I have seen the problem you mentioned on Oneiric 11.10 w/my track pad on my laptop.
2012-01-29T05:29:00.000Z	markyxxxz	sandy	Oh your trackpad is not working too?
2012-01-29T05:29:00.000Z	markyxxxz	sandy	how about keyboard? I'm still on Natty. I have never seen this issue before. Never in my whole "Ubuntu life". hehehe
2012-01-29T05:30:00.000Z	sandy	markyxxxz	What happens is my track pad will freeze .  No my keyboard runs fine . I only have a issue with my track pad.
2012-01-29T05:31:00.000Z	sandy	markyxxxz	I updated my kernel to the latest 3.2.0 kernel and it solved my trackpad problem . Perhaps it could solve yours.
2012-01-29T05:31:00.000Z	markyxxxz	sandy	Oh ok. good for you. having no track/touchpad is better than no keyboard at all :( I can't type anything.
2012-01-29T05:32:00.000Z	markyxxxz	sandy	Thanks. I doubt it. It was working fine. Stupid AMD Catalyst driver really screwed up my system. I 've done this before a lot of times but never this badly. I always was able to restore it.
2012-01-29T05:32:00.000Z	sandy	markyxxxz	I also updated my kernel on my Linuxmint 11 which is based on natty to kernel 3.2 too.
2012-01-29T05:33:00.000Z	markyxxxz	sandy	what PPA are you using for that kernel? I"ve not found one about a month ago. Unless you are compiling it from scratch?
2012-01-29T05:34:00.000Z	sandy	markyxxxz	Yes AMD drivers are still a bit klugy on Linux as a whole. Yet in windows AMD out performs Nvidia at the present time. But nVidia does very well on Linux.
2012-01-29T05:35:00.000Z	markyxxxz	sandy	Thanks. :)
2012-01-29T05:38:00.000Z	sandy	markyxxxz	here is the link use the PPA it's the easiest approach. You might have to modify the PPA to read oneiric instead of natty . That's what I had to do . But kernel 3.2 runs like a charm on my Linuxmint 11 partition just fine :-)
2012-01-29T05:39:00.000Z	markyxxxz	sandy	I can't see the link.... (?)
2012-01-29T05:40:00.000Z	markyxxxz	sandy	Great! :) Thank you...
2012-01-29T05:40:00.000Z	sandy	markyxxxz	Your very welcome
