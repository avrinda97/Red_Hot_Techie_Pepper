2006-05-27T11:05:00.000Z	Madpilot	Some_Person	cool it. An attitude like yours is hardly going to encourage "onthespot" help...

2006-11-20T12:45:00.000Z	Madpilot	Some_Person	no, it's not GPL'd
2006-11-20T12:46:00.000Z	Madpilot	Some_Person	http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/TrademarkPolicy/
2006-11-20T12:46:00.000Z	Madpilot	Some_Person	also, https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Artwork/Official
2006-11-20T12:47:00.000Z	Madpilot	Some_Person	I'm not familiar w/ Wikipedia's classifications, but 'logo' sounds like the right one
2009-12-17T08:38:00.000Z	Madpilot	Some_Person	no, you can't upgrade with the desktop liveCD, you need the alternative install CD for that
