2006-10-31T15:34:00.000Z	Illiyah		Im having problems with xinetd with it, cant get it going at all
2006-10-31T15:34:00.000Z	tlp__	Illiyah	: the service wont run at all?
2006-10-31T15:35:00.000Z	Illiyah	tlp_	its running, but the way glftpd is setup is it runs via xinetd, e.g someone connects on port1 and xinetd opens glftpd on that port, but its not opening it
2006-10-31T15:36:00.000Z	tlp__	Illiyah	: you running tshark on it?

2006-10-31T15:37:00.000Z	Illiyah	tlp_	I believe so
2006-10-31T15:37:00.000Z	tlp__	Illiyah	: doesnt ftp require more than one port?
2006-10-31T15:37:00.000Z	tlp__	Illiyah	: try ...     tshark -i eth0 port 21 or port 22
