2009-12-09T09:28:00.000Z	]pablo[	System-7	 you need to edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf

2009-12-09T09:32:00.000Z	]pablo[	System-7	try   sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2009-12-09T09:32:00.000Z	]pablo[	System-7	if it doesn't work, you need to create /etc/X11/xorg.conf and specify the resolution modes you want
2009-12-09T09:33:00.000Z	]pablo[	System-7	you can find tons of info about this in google "xorg resolution" or something
