2006-08-01T06:56:00.000Z	Zambezi		Shouldn't it be possible to make a folder in /mnt/ without sudo/root?
2006-08-01T06:56:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Zambezi	no
2006-08-01T06:57:00.000Z	Zambezi	Jack_Sparrow	I'll check if I can make folders in mount without sudo.
2006-08-01T06:59:00.000Z	Zambezi	Jack_Sparrow	I can make folders on my harddrive without sudo and I need to make them without sudo.
2006-08-01T06:59:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Zambezi	where were you trying to make them?
2006-08-01T07:00:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Zambezi	You can make folders but I questioned where you wanted to make them
2006-08-01T07:00:00.000Z	Zambezi	Jack_Sparrow	In /mnt/harddrive2
2006-08-01T07:02:00.000Z	Zambezi	Jack_Sparrow	dator@dator:/mnt/harddrive2$ mkdir test // mkdir: cannot create directory `test': Permission denied
2006-08-01T07:02:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Zambezi	exactly
2006-08-01T07:04:00.000Z	Zambezi	Jack_Sparrow	And when I can't make folders without sudo, I can't transfer files over the LAN without using root.
2006-08-01T07:05:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Zambezi	I am tired and about to call it a night.  What format was the mounted drive
2006-08-01T07:07:00.000Z	Zambezi	Jack_Sparrow	It's ext3.
2006-09-03T06:57:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Zambezi	What package did you use to install ice and how hard was it?
2006-09-03T06:57:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Zambezi	And can you switch between that and gnome?
2006-09-03T06:58:00.000Z	Zambezi	Jack_Sparrow	I used sudo apt-get install icewm. I install fileroller too, but it's horrible.
2006-09-03T06:59:00.000Z	Zambezi	Jack_Sparrow	I think I can switch too FVWM, Fluxbox, but I'm not sure what happens with program using X.
2006-09-03T06:59:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Zambezi	One last question how do you run ice once it is installed
2006-09-03T07:01:00.000Z	Zambezi	Jack_Sparrow	, Then I logged in with gdm, I changed session from Xubuntu too IceWM and choose to use it as default.
2009-05-26T18:42:00.000Z	Zambezi	Jack_Sparrow	Wrong person.
