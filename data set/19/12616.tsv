2005-08-08T05:11:00.000Z	nekohayo		...... lmao by using the hoary backports, by FULLY using *all* their repositories (did a 1:1 copy of their sources.list)

2005-08-08T05:14:00.000Z	dimitris		Well i am going to install an antivirus because i use a fat32 partition to make windows communicate with linux just to be sure. I am between clamav and f-prot. Any suggestions? Something easy to use and light on the resources.
2005-08-08T05:15:00.000Z	nekohayo	dimitris	the only antivirus now is for deinfecting windows machines, I think
2005-08-08T05:16:00.000Z	nekohayo		I remember when I went from 98 to ME. I was dumbfounded.
2005-08-08T05:16:00.000Z	dimitris	nekohayo	well since i already have an antivirus in windows then there is no need. Thnx!!!
2005-08-08T05:16:00.000Z	nekohayo	dimitris	for now I guess ^_^;
