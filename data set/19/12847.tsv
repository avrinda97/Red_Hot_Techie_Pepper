2005-06-30T16:59:00.000Z	Kyral	jasoncohen	There is a plugin
2005-06-30T16:59:00.000Z	jasoncohen	Kyral	cool- is it included in sid?
2005-06-30T05:01:00.000Z	jasoncohen	Kyral	thanks
2005-07-16T16:24:00.000Z	jasoncohen	Kyral	how do you find a package based on its contents in apt-cache?
2005-07-16T16:27:00.000Z	jasoncohen	Kyral	i dont' think apt-cache can do what apt-file does. tell me how
2005-07-16T16:27:00.000Z	jasoncohen	Kyral	i just checked the man page- there's nothing about finding a package based on a file it contains
2005-07-16T16:27:00.000Z	Kyral	jasoncohen	I didn't say that :D
2005-07-16T16:27:00.000Z	jasoncohen	Kyral	apt-cache search will only look through filenames & descriptions.
2005-07-16T16:28:00.000Z	jasoncohen	Kyral	well...you said there's no point to apt-file
2005-07-16T16:28:00.000Z	jasoncohen	Kyral	when you're compiling a package and it neads libblah.so.1 and you don't know what package contains that file, you'll need apt-file
2005-07-16T16:28:00.000Z	jasoncohen	Kyral	you don't compile i bet
2005-07-16T16:28:00.000Z	Kyral	jasoncohen	nope. This is why I love Apt :D
2005-07-16T16:29:00.000Z	jasoncohen	Kyral	heh, yeah- but sometimes you might want to compile
2005-07-16T16:29:00.000Z	jasoncohen	Kyral	do you know about apt-get build-dep?
2005-07-16T16:29:00.000Z	jasoncohen	Kyral	it downloads build dependencies automatically for you
2005-07-16T16:29:00.000Z	Kyral	jasoncohen	next time I crash my system I'm gonna do it that way :P
2005-08-10T10:55:00.000Z	jasoncohen	Kyral	why not beep-media-player?
