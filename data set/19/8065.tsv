2008-06-14T16:32:00.000Z	DjViper		okay, who knows how to fix samba sharing in 8.04 so it works with windows puters correctly?
2008-06-14T16:33:00.000Z	simplexio	DjViper	no knowledge, but i recall that you have to change some registery key in windows for it
2008-06-14T16:34:00.000Z	DjViper		hmm oh really?
2008-06-14T16:34:00.000Z	DjViper	simplexio	but how come it worked "out of the box" in 7.10 then?
2008-06-14T16:35:00.000Z	simplexio	DjViper	hmm.. then there is probably some options to turn to get it work, that registery fix thing is few years old info
2008-06-14T16:35:00.000Z	simplexio	DjViper	does it give any error or ...?
2008-06-14T16:36:00.000Z	DjViper	simplexio	in ubuntu, I simply can't list the contents of windows shares
2008-06-14T16:37:00.000Z	simplexio	DjViper	but no problems to log in ?
2008-06-14T16:37:00.000Z	simplexio	DjViper	you 100% that  logged in samba user has rights to read directory
2008-06-14T16:37:00.000Z	DjViper	simplexio	doesn't even ask for a login... that's probably one of the problems
2008-06-14T16:38:00.000Z	DjViper		I'm not logged in, but the user should have access, it works from other win 'puter
2008-06-14T16:38:00.000Z	DjViper		+s
2008-06-14T16:39:00.000Z	simplexio	DjViper	ahh.
2008-06-14T16:39:00.000Z	simplexio	DjViper	force it to use your ubuntu username
2008-06-14T16:40:00.000Z	DjViper	simplexio	how?
2008-06-14T16:40:00.000Z	simplexio	DjViper	in windows, map networks drive and there is option to select username and password
2008-06-14T16:41:00.000Z	DjViper	simplexio	how do you do it on a shared folder?
2008-06-14T16:41:00.000Z	simplexio	DjViper	umm... cant remember, havent used windows for year.
2008-06-14T16:42:00.000Z	simplexio	DjViper	but from filebrowser tools -> map networkd drive -> there should be a button to select login name
