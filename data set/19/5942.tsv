2008-04-12T08:41:00.000Z	bluefoxx	TimOBeee	ive been overclocking mine for the past year to avoid buying a new one. cooling and a good mainboard are what i reccomend[asrock is good for overclocking].
2008-04-12T08:42:00.000Z	bluefoxx	TimOBeee	dual is good enough for any current games :) better than mine[2.93 ghz celeron d uped to 3.3 ghz]
