2007-10-31T15:02:00.000Z	cua0	gluonman	once you tar zxvf wmp64.tgz it will create a directory.
2007-10-31T15:03:00.000Z	gluonman	cua0	can you give me the specific syntax? I tried typing tar zxvf wmp64.tgz, but nothing worked. What comes before it?
2007-10-31T15:03:00.000Z	cua0	gluonman	nothing comes before it.
2007-10-31T15:03:00.000Z	gluonman	cua0	hm.
2007-10-31T15:13:00.000Z	cua0	gluonman	the up arrow?
2007-10-31T15:13:00.000Z	cua0	gluonman	cat .bashrc_history ?
2007-10-31T15:14:00.000Z	gluonman	cua0	ikonia, thanks.
2007-10-31T15:14:00.000Z	cua0	gluonman	.bash_history not .bashrc_history
2007-10-31T15:14:00.000Z	gluonman	cua0	okay.
2007-10-31T15:19:00.000Z	cua0	gluonman	you do realise that running windows apps via wine is going to be detrimental to performance right?
2007-10-31T15:20:00.000Z	gluonman	cua0	in what way? Not that I'm running a large number of windows programs. Just a couple.
2007-10-31T15:20:00.000Z	cua0	gluonman	think of it as the application having to pass through an extra 'layer' of software before getting to the hardware.
2007-10-31T15:21:00.000Z	gluonman	cua0	right. My understanding is that the windows program itself may not perform as well as it would in a windows os. But it seems like you were saying it will be detrimental to the performance of linux ubuntu?
2007-10-31T15:22:00.000Z	cua0	gluonman	no, just to the app
2007-10-31T15:23:00.000Z	gluonman	cua0	right. I was aware of that. But World of Warcraft has been running decently, which is my other windows program.
2007-10-31T15:23:00.000Z	cua0	gluonman	fair enough. just figured i'd let you know :)
2007-10-31T15:24:00.000Z	gluonman	cua0	I read up on wine and windows programs compatibility thoroughly before attempting to introduce something to my computer that I wasn't sure of.
2007-10-31T15:24:00.000Z	cua0	gluonman	good call :)
2007-10-31T15:24:00.000Z	gluonman	cua0	but I do appreciate your comments.
