2011-05-30T04:29:00.000Z	atlambert		having problems installing ubuntu on my netbook
2011-05-30T04:29:00.000Z	KM0201	atlambert	what kind of probs?
2011-05-30T04:30:00.000Z	KM0201	atlambert	don't kill windows if you're having trouble w/ this.
2011-05-30T04:30:00.000Z	atlambert	KM0201	:/ windows 7... runs like trash on this netbook
2011-05-30T04:31:00.000Z	KM0201	atlambert	how much experience do you have w/ ubuntu?
2011-05-30T04:31:00.000Z	atlambert	KM0201	decent but i'm not a power user. i usually end up reinstalling ubuntu because of updates being weird
2011-05-30T04:32:00.000Z	KM0201	atlambert	i'd really encourage you not to nuke windows, and instead set up a dual boot
2011-05-30T04:32:00.000Z	atlambert	KM0201	dont have space for that
2011-05-30T04:33:00.000Z	atlambert	KM0201	it takes quite a long time to uninstall everything. as i said, performance is awful
2011-05-30T04:33:00.000Z	KM0201	atlambert	well did you try to boot the USB?  if so, what happened?
2011-05-30T04:33:00.000Z	atlambert	KM0201	yep i try to boot from usb and... nothing happens. just launches windows as normal
2011-05-30T04:33:00.000Z	KM0201	atlambert	you probably need to put the USB device first in your boot order.
2011-05-30T04:34:00.000Z	atlambert	KM0201	for what it's worth, i'm booting from an ipod. :/
2011-05-30T04:43:00.000Z	KM0201	atlambert	you only ave 1gig of space.. hwo the heck are you gonna use wubi?
2011-05-30T04:44:00.000Z	KM0201	atlambert	i'd strongly advise you not to do that.. but hey, we all gotta learn on our own..
2011-05-30T04:45:00.000Z	atlambert	KM0201	2.65 gb to be exact
2011-05-30T04:48:00.000Z	atlambert	KM0201	haha
2011-05-30T09:41:00.000Z	KM0201	atlambert	ubuntu netbook remix... isn't really needed anymore, because Ubuntu's new Unity interface, is very similar to UNR...
