2009-04-24T04:40:00.000Z	RandomUsr	indicava	does that option get past the inability to start 3d acceleration?
2009-04-24T04:41:00.000Z	RandomUsr	indicava	i thought that was only for low level card functioning?
2009-04-24T04:42:00.000Z	indicava	RandomUsr	for me it just greatly improved performance, before enabling that option everything about the Jaunty UI seemed :sluggish
2009-04-24T04:42:00.000Z	RandomUsr	indicava	I think that your problem is different than asmund's
2009-04-24T04:43:00.000Z	RandomUsr	indicava	what board do you have?
2009-04-24T04:43:00.000Z	indicava	RandomUsr	how do I check quick?
2009-04-24T04:44:00.000Z	RandomUsr	indicava	lspci from the command line
2009-04-24T04:45:00.000Z	indicava	RandomUsr	its on a Lenovo T60
2009-04-24T04:45:00.000Z	RandomUsr	indicava	there's not much you can do with that chipset
2009-04-24T04:46:00.000Z	indicava	RandomUsr	actually its performing quite well, with quite a few compiz effects enabled
2009-04-24T04:46:00.000Z	RandomUsr	indicava	I believe that not all 3d functions are available on your chipset
2009-04-24T04:47:00.000Z	indicava	RandomUsr	what do you mean "put the fix out"?
2009-04-24T04:48:00.000Z	RandomUsr	indicava	my understanding is that, the 945 series had troubles with 3d acceleration using compiz
2009-04-24T04:49:00.000Z	indicava	RandomUsr	can give me an example, I'll try. i'm curious
2009-04-24T04:50:00.000Z	RandomUsr	indicava	I'm thinking you'd have trouble with the extras, but maybe not since kernel 2.6.26 or 28
2009-04-24T04:51:00.000Z	indicava	RandomUsr	i'm on 2.6.28
2009-04-24T04:51:00.000Z	RandomUsr	indicava	Jaunty?
2009-04-24T04:52:00.000Z	indicava	RandomUsr	and proud of it! (that means yea)
2009-04-24T04:53:00.000Z	RandomUsr	indicava	here's the original post from debian
