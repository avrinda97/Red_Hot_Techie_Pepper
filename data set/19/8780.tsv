2008-03-20T07:33:00.000Z	lee___		(firefox-bin:16473): Gtk-WARNING **: cannot open display:
2008-03-20T07:33:00.000Z	lee___		I can't run anything for some reason, can someone help?
2008-03-20T07:33:00.000Z	Fryguy--	lee___	restart X?
2008-03-20T07:34:00.000Z	Fryguy--	lee___	what is the output of ls -a ~/.[xX]*
2008-03-20T07:35:00.000Z	lee___	Fryguy--	Can I PM it to you?
2008-03-20T07:35:00.000Z	Fryguy--	lee___	no, pastebin it if you must, it should only be one line
2008-03-20T07:35:00.000Z	lee___	Fryguy--	It's multiple lines, and I can't open firefox, so how do you expect me to pastebin it?
2008-03-20T07:36:00.000Z	Fryguy--	lee___	no
2008-03-20T07:37:00.000Z	Fryguy--	lee___	if i was looking for .xsession-errors I would have asked for it
2008-03-20T07:37:00.000Z	lee___	Fryguy--	Then do you want xmms, xine, or xchat2?
2008-03-20T07:38:00.000Z	Fryguy--	lee___	so the entries are .xsession-erorrs, .Xauthority, xmms, xine, and xchat2?
2008-03-20T07:39:00.000Z	Fryguy--	lee___	linx, lynx, w3m, links2
2008-03-20T07:40:00.000Z	lee___	Fryguy--	Says no such package "linx", but "lynx" is installing.
2008-03-20T07:40:00.000Z	Fryguy--	lee___	w3m is installed by default as well i think
2008-03-20T07:42:00.000Z	Fryguy--	lee___	before you do any of this, try deleting .Xauthority and restarting X
2008-03-20T07:42:00.000Z	Fryguy--	lee___	sure
