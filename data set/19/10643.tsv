2006-07-06T12:51:00.000Z	nooby_god		or you have /mnt/win
2006-07-06T12:51:00.000Z	nooby_god		basicly a mount point is where you can access the other partitions
2006-07-06T12:51:00.000Z	nooby_god		so I have a mount point called /win
2006-07-06T12:52:00.000Z	nooby_god		there I can access my windows partition
2006-07-06T12:52:00.000Z	nooby_god		so /dev/hda1 is mounted at /dev/win
2006-07-06T12:52:00.000Z	nooby_god		*/win not /dev/win
2006-07-06T12:54:00.000Z	nooby_god		if / is screwed up, you can still access the kernel
2006-07-06T12:55:00.000Z	nooby_god		I have three storage partitions, one for /, one for /home and /win
2006-07-06T12:57:00.000Z	nooby_god		reading docs is the most important part of linux
2006-07-06T12:57:00.000Z	nooby_god		!sp
2006-07-06T12:57:00.000Z	tsume	nooby_god	not really
2006-07-06T12:58:00.000Z	tsume	nooby_god	being knowledable and knowing how to think is more important
2006-07-06T12:58:00.000Z	nooby_god	tsume	you can only be knowledgeable if you read docs
2006-07-06T12:58:00.000Z	tsume	nooby_god	not really
2006-07-06T12:59:00.000Z	tsume	nooby_god	I haven't read any docs, I just know how  to use programs because I modify the sources so much ;)
2006-07-06T13:15:00.000Z	nooby_god	tsume	get out of the chan if you don't like noobs
2006-07-06T13:16:00.000Z	nooby_god	tsume	join #gentoo for advanced stuff
2006-07-06T13:16:00.000Z	tsume	nooby_god	I know. I'm just used to having intresting discussions in channels like #freebsd
2006-07-06T13:16:00.000Z	tsume	nooby_god	are you kidding me.. thats like kiddie central.
