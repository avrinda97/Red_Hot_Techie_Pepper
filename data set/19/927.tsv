2011-07-19T00:10:00.000Z	e_t_	przemek_	How did you configure you NICs?
2011-07-19T00:11:00.000Z	przemek_	e_t_	world is dhcp and private is static
2011-07-19T00:11:00.000Z	e_t_	przemek_	did you set a default route on the static interface?
2011-07-19T00:12:00.000Z	przemek_	e_t_	no, gateway is only cofigured for world nic
2011-07-19T00:13:00.000Z	przemek_	e_t_	and in route table for some reson the private nic is listet as my gateway
2011-07-19T00:16:00.000Z	e_t_	przemek_	try "sudo ifdown (static)" to see if that gets rid of the default route.
2011-07-19T00:16:00.000Z	przemek_	e_t_	i did it before ad it does get rid of problem
2011-07-19T00:17:00.000Z	przemek_	e_t_	and as soon as I bring it up and try any lookup in private network problem comes back
2011-07-19T00:17:00.000Z	e_t_	przemek_	Then something in the network config IS setting a gateway on that interface.
2011-07-19T00:17:00.000Z	przemek_	e_t_	right and how to find it?
2011-07-19T00:17:00.000Z	e_t_	przemek_	Did you use NetworkManager or /etc/network/interfaces  to setup the static IP?
2011-07-19T00:18:00.000Z	przemek_	e_t_	/etc/network/interfaces
2011-07-19T00:18:00.000Z	e_t_	przemek_	Can you pastebin the file?
2011-07-19T00:18:00.000Z	przemek_	e_t_	here?
2011-07-19T00:25:00.000Z	przemek_	e_t_	http://paste.ubuntu.com/646785/
2011-07-19T00:32:00.000Z	przemek_	e_t_	got enything?
2011-07-19T00:37:00.000Z	e_t_	przemek_	try "sudo ip route change default via X.X.X.X" where X.X.X.X is the IP address of your real gateway.
2011-07-19T00:39:00.000Z	przemek_	e_t_	it sais "RTNETLINK answers: File exists" and does nothing
2011-07-19T00:51:00.000Z	e_t_	przemek_	What happens if you run "sudo dhclient eth0"?
