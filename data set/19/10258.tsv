2006-07-06T07:08:00.000Z	Sleeping_Sloth		its in the multiverse I think
2006-07-06T07:10:00.000Z	Sleeping_Sloth		but I'm sure I read somewhere that the i386 is in the multiverse
2006-07-06T07:10:00.000Z	farky	Sleeping_Sloth	Well i'm using 32-bit and it works
2006-07-06T07:13:00.000Z	farky	Sleeping_Sloth	ardchoille: here is the link to add the extra repositories: http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Dapper#How_to_install_Messenger_.28Skype.29
2006-07-06T07:13:00.000Z	Sleeping_Sloth	farky	you beat me to it: the repos is: deb http://download.skype.com/linux/repos/debian/ stable non-free
2006-07-06T07:13:00.000Z	farky	Sleeping_Sloth	dli: correction, that is the link for "how" to install it
2006-07-06T07:14:00.000Z	farky	Sleeping_Sloth	yeah skype works, it just needs a little more work. It's pretty slow
2006-07-06T07:14:00.000Z	Sleeping_Sloth	farky	- mine works okay on 64 bit under linux32
2006-07-06T07:15:00.000Z	farky	Sleeping_Sloth	how fast does it start up though?
2006-07-06T07:15:00.000Z	Sleeping_Sloth	farky	a few seconds - hold on, I'll fire it up again...:p
2006-07-06T07:16:00.000Z	Sleeping_Sloth	farky	lol..... it took a full 20 seconds....
2006-07-06T07:16:00.000Z	Sleeping_Sloth	farky	although both cpus are maxed folding
2006-07-06T07:17:00.000Z	Sleeping_Sloth	farky	but I think that would make little difference
2006-07-06T07:17:00.000Z	farky	Sleeping_Sloth	yeah, but I can just tell, even with minimal processes running, it still takes like 10 seconds
2006-07-06T07:18:00.000Z	Sleeping_Sloth	farky	- thats what I remember - about 10 seems about right.
2006-07-06T07:18:00.000Z	farky	Sleeping_Sloth	but at least it works eh?
2006-07-06T07:18:00.000Z	Sleeping_Sloth	farky	once it's fired up its fine. worked out of the box - IM, file transfer, VOIP
2006-07-06T07:19:00.000Z	Sleeping_Sloth	farky	(although only using a headset - not tried proper VOIP calling through it)
2006-07-06T07:20:00.000Z	farky	Sleeping_Sloth	yeah im using a headset also, but it's a pain to use on an old 650Mhz, 128M ram laptop
