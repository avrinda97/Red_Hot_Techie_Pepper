2010-03-29T16:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Richiie	 look in the source dir. see what binaries it made..  when you did a make install also watch to see what itinstalled in various 'bin' directories
2010-03-29T16:06:00.000Z	Richiie	Dr_Willis	yes i see a lot of stuff installed in various usr/bin folders
2010-03-29T16:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Richiie	 and mame is in the repos.  i last used 'advancedmame' years ago. normal mame in the repos can play neogo games also.
2010-03-29T16:06:00.000Z	Richiie	Dr_Willis	well i got problems whit "normal mame" cuz it wont load my neo Geo roms
2010-03-29T16:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Richiie	 install mame from the repos and some front ends to it..   Or check out the docs for what you installed
2010-03-29T16:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Richiie	 then you got some issue with the roms i imagine. It works with them here.
2010-03-29T16:07:00.000Z	Richiie	Dr_Willis	Docs ?,
2010-03-29T16:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Richiie	 yes. mame and advancedmame both have homepages with more docs  then you can imagine
2010-03-29T16:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Richiie	 it goes with the other mame roms in the roms dir
2010-03-29T16:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Richiie	  and the command for advancedmame is proberly 'advancedmame'
2010-03-29T16:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Richiie	 look in the source dirs to see what binaries it made
2010-03-29T16:12:00.000Z	Richiie	Dr_Willis	nope nothing happens when i type advancedmame in the terminal
2010-03-29T16:13:00.000Z	Richiie	Dr_Willis	ok i have another question, lets erase advancedmame, how should i do if i started whit ./configure and then make make install
