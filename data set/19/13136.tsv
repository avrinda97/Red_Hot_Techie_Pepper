2005-05-18T15:33:00.000Z	goldfish		dont think so
2005-05-18T15:34:00.000Z	sbcl3_	goldfish	was that for my question?
2005-05-18T15:34:00.000Z	goldfish	sbcl3_	yep
2005-05-18T15:34:00.000Z	goldfish	sbcl3_	do you want it to be?
2005-05-18T15:35:00.000Z	goldfish	sbcl3_	well that will do it for everything in the directory.
2005-05-18T15:36:00.000Z	goldfish	sbcl3_	but if u make a new directory after the chmod, it wont have the permissions of the others.
2005-05-18T15:37:00.000Z	sbcl3_	goldfish	any way around that?
2005-05-18T15:38:00.000Z	goldfish	sbcl3_	yea hold on
2005-05-18T15:40:00.000Z	goldfish	sbcl3_	man uname
2005-05-18T15:40:00.000Z	goldfish	sbcl3_	i dont know if u can do it for a particular directory though
2005-05-18T15:40:00.000Z	goldfish	sbcl3_	chmod -R is prolly the best thing to do.
2005-05-19T16:13:00.000Z	sbcl3_	goldfish	did you ever find out anything?
2005-05-19T16:14:00.000Z	goldfish	sbcl3_	nope, the command to do that is uname, but i dont think u can specify it to work for a certain directory, i think that works for ALL files you create.
2005-05-19T16:14:00.000Z	goldfish	sbcl3_	prolly best to run the chmod -R command.
2005-05-19T16:15:00.000Z	goldfish	sbcl3_	maybe you could set up a cron job to execute the chmod command on the directory for you
2005-05-19T16:15:00.000Z	sbcl3_	goldfish	isn't that what i did?
2005-05-19T16:15:00.000Z	goldfish	sbcl3_	i thought u wanted it for new folders created it in the directory?
2005-05-19T16:17:00.000Z	sbcl3_	goldfish	as i'm the owner it seems to work fine...
2005-05-19T16:17:00.000Z	goldfish	sbcl3_	I thought you meant, that each time you created a folder in that directory you wanted it to have a certain permission.
