2007-06-02T10:17:00.000Z	thirdy		I've installed KDE
2007-06-02T10:18:00.000Z	thirdy		how do I switch to KDE?
2007-06-02T10:19:00.000Z	radioaktivstorm	thirdy	if you installed it kde , then you can log out and find it in the sessions menu on the login screen.
2007-06-02T10:32:00.000Z	radioaktivstorm	thirdy	kde  should be on the login screen under sessions. if you click sessions, it should come up with your choices
2007-06-02T10:34:00.000Z	radioaktivstorm	thirdy	kde  should be on the login screen under sessions. if you click sessions, it should come up with your choices. log out then sessions then kde
2007-06-02T10:35:00.000Z	thirdy	radioaktivstorm	nope I don't see any , but the splash screen changed to kubuntu not xubuntu anymore
2007-06-02T10:35:00.000Z	radioaktivstorm	thirdy	it might be under options
2007-06-02T10:36:00.000Z	thirdy	radioaktivstorm	where can set that options?
2007-06-02T10:37:00.000Z	radioaktivstorm	thirdy	when you installed kubuntu-desktop there was a screen that said gdm or kdm
2007-06-02T10:38:00.000Z	thirdy	radioaktivstorm	ok I had an install, it said erorr could not look up port or somting
2007-06-02T10:39:00.000Z	radioaktivstorm	thirdy	hmm....i havent encountered that before. was that when you tried to log on?
2007-06-02T10:39:00.000Z	thirdy	radioaktivstorm	can I just install again? sudo aptitude install kubuntu-desktop
2007-06-02T10:40:00.000Z	thirdy	radioaktivstorm	nope while installing
2007-06-02T10:41:00.000Z	radioaktivstorm	thirdy	maybe try an sudo aptitude remove kubuntu-desktop then repeat the install?
2007-06-02T10:42:00.000Z	radioaktivstorm	thirdy	if that doesnt work, and youre itching to use kde, maybe try sudo aptitude install kde-core. its not quite the same, definitely more lightweight...but it might work for you ^^
2007-06-02T10:43:00.000Z	radioaktivstorm	thirdy	mmkay, try reinstalling it and seeing what happens
2007-06-02T10:48:00.000Z	radioaktivstorm	thirdy	how goes the install? did kubuntu desktop  come on nicely yet?
2007-06-02T11:46:00.000Z	radioaktivstorm	thirdy	you got your kde up and running? wonderful :)
2007-06-02T11:46:00.000Z	thirdy	radioaktivstorm	yeah thanx everyone!
