2005-10-14T15:01:00.000Z	micro_girl		anyone knows how to add mounted iso's to the synaptic's packet manager???
2005-10-14T15:01:00.000Z	micro_girl		how???
2005-10-14T15:02:00.000Z	intelikey	micro_girl	try "man apt-cdrom" it should tell you.
2005-10-14T15:05:00.000Z	intelikey	micro_girl	"sudo mkdir /media/iso0 ;sudo mount <path to your iso> /media/iso0 ;sudo apt-cdrom <aproprate info> "
2005-10-14T15:06:00.000Z	intelikey	micro_girl	it's pretty easy as an iso also.   just mount the iso and point apt-cdrom at it.....
2005-10-14T15:07:00.000Z	micro_girl	intelikey	I did exactly what you told me
2005-10-14T15:08:00.000Z	intelikey	micro_girl	what is the name and path of the iso file?  i'll write you a line you can paste in a terminal to mount it.
2005-10-14T15:10:00.000Z	intelikey	micro_girl	ls your mount point to make sure it is mounted.
2005-10-14T15:16:00.000Z	intelikey	micro_girl	any error up to step 4 ?
2005-10-14T15:20:00.000Z	micro_girl	intelikey	hum?
2005-10-14T15:23:00.000Z	intelikey	micro_girl	didn't you leave out "add" ?
2005-10-14T15:25:00.000Z	intelikey	micro_girl	i can't type the command for you as concerning apt-cdrom, i don't use ubuntu or debian so i don't have the apt syntax memorized.  sorry.
2005-10-14T15:27:00.000Z	intelikey	micro_girl	it will be something like "apt-cdrom add -m /media/iso0 "
2005-10-14T15:29:00.000Z	intelikey	micro_girl	your welcome  :)
2005-10-14T15:31:00.000Z	intelikey	micro_girl	yes.
2005-10-14T15:35:00.000Z	intelikey	micro_girl	open the Term and type "sudo apt-config " (might hit the tab key to make sure it is not configure) and the bottom line "edit <blah>" and comment out the first line.
2005-10-14T15:36:00.000Z	intelikey	micro_girl	can i ask if you are on dialup or is there some reason not to use the online sources ?
2005-10-14T15:37:00.000Z	micro_girl	intelikey	in portugal we have download limit, and if I downloaded that I would have to use 1/4 of our monthly downloads!
