2010-03-28T01:55:00.000Z	crypt-0	deanus	build-essential you mean.
2010-03-28T02:01:00.000Z	crypt-0	deanus	sudo /etc/init.d/vboxdrv setup manuall fails as usual :  * modprobe vboxdrv failed. Please use 'dmesg' to find out why
2010-03-28T02:02:00.000Z	deanus	crypt-0	no, sorry :)   leave out the manuall, that was me trying to say manually
2010-03-28T02:10:00.000Z	crypt-0	deanus	still fails.
2010-03-28T02:11:00.000Z	deanus	crypt-0	have you got dkms installed?  did you use the repo or the deb
