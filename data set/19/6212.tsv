2008-02-24T16:39:00.000Z	blahbo		hey all
2008-02-24T16:40:00.000Z	blahbo		my system behaves weird after upgrading to 7.10 -- firefox takes about 1 minute to come up... and when i click the shutdown butten on the upper right corner, the system just freezes up. generally, there are lags everywhere, also doing basic stuff like 'ls' in shell
2008-02-24T16:40:00.000Z	blahbo		any ideas what could be wrong?
2008-02-24T16:42:00.000Z	blahbo		after 7.10 upgrade: firefox start-up takes 1min and freezes X... clicking on shutdown icon freezes X.. any ideas?
2008-02-24T16:42:00.000Z	iositd	blahbo	try running firefxo from a console and see if it gives you any other information
2008-02-24T16:43:00.000Z	blahbo	iositd	okay, let me check
2008-02-24T16:44:00.000Z	blahbo	iositd	just figured that running firefox as root is really quick. however, running firefox as a user, it just hangs in there
2008-02-24T16:46:00.000Z	iositd	blahbo	i don't really know why it hangs. You can try to reinstall it from synaptic and see if it helps as it can be corrupted/missing user files
2008-02-24T16:46:00.000Z	blahbo	iositd	okay, thanks will do that too
2008-02-24T17:21:00.000Z	iositd	blahbo	depends what you call slow. What sort of HD do you have? depending on which one, 11 meg a second isn't bad
2008-02-24T17:21:00.000Z	blahbo	iositd	it just feels a lot slower. i'm running a toshiba laptpo with a core 2 duo proc.. sata disk of any kind
2008-02-24T17:22:00.000Z	blahbo	iositd	any idea of where those md5sum processes come from? i disabled indexing in the user profile...
2008-02-24T17:22:00.000Z	iositd	blahbo	md5 processes are not related to indexing afaik
2008-02-24T17:22:00.000Z	iositd	blahbo	give me a sec while i look it up
2008-02-24T17:23:00.000Z	blahbo	iositd	it's really strange.. there's an md5sum process that keeps trying to index a 2GB truecrypt file
2008-02-24T17:25:00.000Z	iositd	blahbo	there is a command that can limit programs to a maximum amount of cpu usage ... it isn't ideal but it would help you for now at least ... though i lost that name as well
2008-02-24T17:25:00.000Z	blahbo	iositd	yep, i know what you mean..... still, this is really weird.
2008-02-24T17:26:00.000Z	blahbo	iositd	it seems that md5sum is invoked when i start up firefox
2008-02-24T17:27:00.000Z	iositd	blahbo	i agree, it's a wierd situation ...
