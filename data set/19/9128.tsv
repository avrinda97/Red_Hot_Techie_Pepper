2007-02-06T11:31:00.000Z	jackson3246		Hello! I've just installed (after much toil) Ubuntu on a friend's computer. I set up a dual-boot for him on two partitions (the other is Windows XP Home). The only problem I had with installing was that the keyboard, regardless of what I did, would not work while using the Edgy i386 LiveCD. I got around that obstacle by copy/pasting information and changing stuff later via the mouse, but now that it's installed the keyboard on
2007-02-06T11:32:00.000Z	xelados	jackson3246	could you complete your question/issue?
2007-02-06T11:33:00.000Z	jackson3246	xelados	how?
2007-02-06T11:34:00.000Z	xelados	jackson3246	It seemed to cut off your chat line, so I don't know what the problem is that you're having with the keyboard.
2007-02-06T11:34:00.000Z	jackson3246	xelados	ohh sory. the keyboard doesn't work often (roughly 12.5% of the time) and the system sometimes restarts when I select Ubuntu in GRUB
2007-02-06T11:35:00.000Z	jackson3246	xelados	and the keyboard didn't work at all in the LiveCD
2007-02-06T11:35:00.000Z	jackson3246	xelados	no. it's PS/2
2007-02-06T11:35:00.000Z	xelados	jackson3246	That's odd. I can't think of any reason for a PS/2 keyboard to stop working.
2007-02-06T11:36:00.000Z	jackson3246	xelados	I would suspect it to be a hardware problem, but it works fine and consistently in windows. could it be a problem with how the kernel is interfacing with the (apparently at least a little bit broken) hardware?
2007-02-06T11:36:00.000Z	xelados	jackson3246	How old is the computer? Has it had hardware problems in the past? Are other keyboards (USB or such) installed?
2007-02-06T11:37:00.000Z	jackson3246	xelados	it's about three years old. I'm not sure if you got this part of my message: "The only semi-relevant problem I know of is that his BIOS thinks there's something wrong with his CPU and he has to press F1 every time he boots to get past a weird diagnostic screen."
2007-02-06T11:37:00.000Z	jackson3246	xelados	oh and it's a pentium 4 so nothing strange there. he's not sure what's wrong with it or when the error started occurring
2007-02-06T11:37:00.000Z	xelados	jackson3246	That could be it.. I dunno. Have you tried other keyboards with it? The problem with the CPU sounds odd, too.
2007-02-06T11:38:00.000Z	xelados	jackson3246	I wouldn't be surprised if the CPU error is related to the keyboard error.
2007-02-06T11:38:00.000Z	jackson3246	xelados	really? I was thinking that but I'm not extremely good with hardware problems so I wasn't really sure. I might just try it out with a new processor, then. thanks!
2007-02-06T11:39:00.000Z	xelados	jackson3246	I'm no expert on hardware. Have you tried posting on the forums?
2007-02-06T11:39:00.000Z	jackson3246	xelados	yeah. nobody's responded
2007-02-06T11:40:00.000Z	xelados	jackson3246	Sounds like a pretty unique problem, then. More than likely something somewhere is damaged. But it's not good to have a less-than-perfectly operating CPU. I think most people would agree. :P
2007-02-06T11:40:00.000Z	jackson3246	xelados	yeah. haha. oh well. I think I have an old P4 lying around that I can loan him for experimentation. if not, I think they're pretty cheap nowadays anyway.
