2006-10-20T07:57:00.000Z	jrib	_julian_	do you have dapper main enabled?
2006-10-20T07:57:00.000Z	_julian_	jrib	yep, you can see my sources.list here: http://pastebin.ca/211769
2006-10-20T07:58:00.000Z	jrib	_julian_	it should work... you check for typos maybe?
2006-10-20T08:00:00.000Z	_julian_	jrib	it wants to fetch http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/a/awstats/awstats_6.5-1ubuntu1.1_all.deb, but theres only a newer package there...
2006-10-20T08:00:00.000Z	jrib	_julian_	what's the exact error you get from apt?
2006-10-20T08:01:00.000Z	_julian_	jrib	http://pastebin.ca/211775 that's the whole output
2006-10-20T08:04:00.000Z	jrib	_julian_	try apt-get update again
2006-10-20T08:04:00.000Z	_julian_	jrib	no change
2006-10-20T08:05:00.000Z	jrib	_julian_	I think it might be server side, someone was having problems earlier with security
2006-10-20T08:05:00.000Z	_julian_	jrib	is there any alternative server I could use?
2006-10-20T08:07:00.000Z	jrib	_julian_	you could use the package in main and not from security, though that might be a security risk.  I don't remember the xact apt syntax for taht at the moment
2006-10-20T08:14:00.000Z	jrib	_julian_	do you use i386?
2006-10-20T08:14:00.000Z	_julian_	jrib	no, amd64
2006-10-20T08:17:00.000Z	jrib	_julian_	do you understand how apt figures out that url?  I thought it used packages.gz, do you know if that is correct?
2006-10-20T08:17:00.000Z	_julian_	jrib	I think so, too
2006-10-20T08:18:00.000Z	jrib	_julian_	http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/dapper-security/main/binary-amd64/Packages.gz is different than what you are fetching, can you read yours in /var/cache/apt/ and see if it is the same?
2006-10-20T08:19:00.000Z	_julian_	jrib	will check, one sec
2006-10-20T08:21:00.000Z	jrib	_julian_	I assume it saves the file somewhre in there but idk
