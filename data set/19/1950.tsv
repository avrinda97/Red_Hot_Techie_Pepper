2011-12-19T05:54:00.000Z	RingZer0		just upgraded hardware drivers for nvidia, now X wont start
2011-12-19T05:55:00.000Z	RingZer0		any thoughts on how to roll back a driver?
2011-12-19T05:55:00.000Z	RingZer0		or at least start xorg config from scratch?
2011-12-19T05:57:00.000Z	paulsomebody	RingZer0	Unless you deliberately written it, there is no xorg.conf on Ubuntu 11.10 by default.
2011-12-19T05:57:00.000Z	paulsomebody	RingZer0	My best guess would be to remove the associated package, then the driver should deactivate.
2011-12-19T05:59:00.000Z	paulsomebody	RingZer0	Or, alternatively, you can use 'lsmod' to list all activated driver modules, and then use 'sudo modprobe -r <module_name>' to remove that driver.
2011-12-19T05:59:00.000Z	paulsomebody	RingZer0	I meant, driver module.
2011-12-19T06:02:00.000Z	paulsomebody	RingZer0	Did you read my response?
2011-12-19T06:04:00.000Z	RingZer0	paulsomebody	I will try that now
2011-12-19T06:05:00.000Z	paulsomebody	RingZer0	Use 'sudo modprobe' to add back modules if it won't help.
2011-12-19T06:05:00.000Z	RingZer0	paulsomebody	okay
2011-12-19T06:10:00.000Z	paulsomebody	RingZer0	Hmm. Have you tried removing the package?
2011-12-19T06:10:00.000Z	paulsomebody	RingZer0	It looks to me, that version of the driver module in your kernel is different from the one you have installed, which produces the error you mentioned.
2011-12-19T06:11:00.000Z	paulsomebody	RingZer0	I have got that once, when the installation got interrupted.
2011-12-19T06:11:00.000Z	paulsomebody	RingZer0	I just re-installed it and things got back to green zone.
2011-12-19T06:12:00.000Z	paulsomebody	RingZer0	Not the system. :) The driver.
2011-12-19T06:14:00.000Z	paulsomebody	RingZer0	Yes.
2011-12-19T06:19:00.000Z	paulsomebody	RingZer0	GNU/Linux is the totally unholy system â€” demons, zombies.
2011-12-19T06:19:00.000Z	paulsomebody	RingZer0	And the USER commands them all!
