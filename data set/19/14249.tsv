2005-03-27T10:20:00.000Z	dle		I find Deb/Ubuntu's kernel packaging confusing.
2005-03-27T10:20:00.000Z	tritium	dle	it's nice to have kernels under package management, though
2005-03-27T10:21:00.000Z	dle	tritium	Yes, but Ubu's not alone in that. I can't make head or tail of them.
2005-03-27T10:22:00.000Z	tritium	dle	what aspect?
2005-03-27T10:30:00.000Z	tritium	dle	yes, I upgraded that kernel, but I'm running Hoary, anyway, so I don't boot into that kernel.
2005-03-27T10:31:00.000Z	tritium	dle	it is, as I already installed it.
2005-03-27T10:32:00.000Z	dle	tritium	Odd. I've updated, but the only ones available are -3 thru -5.
2005-03-27T10:34:00.000Z	tritium	dle	do you have warty-security repo in your sources.list?
2005-03-27T10:35:00.000Z	dle	tritium	yes
2005-03-27T10:36:00.000Z	tritium	dle	hmm...
2005-03-27T10:41:00.000Z	tritium	dle	I guess your mirror is slow to sync
2005-03-27T10:43:00.000Z	dle	tritium	http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/
2005-03-27T10:45:00.000Z	tritium	dle	what?
2005-03-27T10:46:00.000Z	dle	tritium	that's the mirror I'm using (if it's a mirror at all).
2005-03-27T10:55:00.000Z	dle	tritium	what mirror do you use for security?
2005-03-27T10:55:00.000Z	tritium	dle	deb http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu warty-security main restricted
2005-03-27T10:57:00.000Z	dle	tritium	same here.  Colour me baffled.
2006-04-02T11:02:00.000Z	tritium	dle	please ask in #ubuntu+1
2006-04-02T11:03:00.000Z	dle	tritium	okay, thanks.
