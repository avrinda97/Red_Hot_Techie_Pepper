2009-07-06T21:17:00.000Z	Kjell	GJ	alt+1 then
2009-07-06T20:59:00.000Z	Kjell	GJ	try alt + f2
2009-07-06T21:03:00.000Z	Kjell	GJ	you can use kdvi to view the files you compiled
2009-07-06T21:04:00.000Z	Kjell	GJ	kile will open kdvi
2009-07-06T21:05:00.000Z	Kjell	GJ	kile just edit the code
2009-07-06T21:06:00.000Z	GJ	Kjell	Don't think I got kdvi installed, leme do some diggin' and try to find if I can set it to fire up another program
2009-07-06T21:06:00.000Z	Kjell	GJ	you likely have the unifide program then. alt + f1 should open it
2009-07-06T21:07:00.000Z	GJ	Kjell	alt f1 or alt f2 just launch up my Programs and Command line from Ubuntu, they're not Kile keys.
2009-07-06T21:08:00.000Z	GJ	Kjell	when using them inside Kile*
2009-07-06T21:09:00.000Z	GJ	Kjell	Aha found how to get it working :) Thanks alot
2009-07-06T21:09:00.000Z	Kjell	GJ	ok the new viewer is called okular which should be install when you installed kile. otherwise you can use evince to view the files
2009-07-06T21:09:00.000Z	GJ	Kjell	Yep Okular is what it uses :)
2009-07-06T21:10:00.000Z	Kjell	GJ	but you can change what it launch it its settup. I find that kdvi is much better for image viewing
2009-07-06T21:11:00.000Z	GJ	Kjell	Ok I'll take a look at that ^
2009-07-06T21:12:00.000Z	GJ	Kjell	One more quick question, when I compile the .tex file and stuff it should create some other files too (log file, .aux file etc), where do those end up?
2009-07-06T21:13:00.000Z	Kjell	GJ	in the same folder .tex file is
2009-07-06T21:15:00.000Z	GJ	Kjell	Ok thanks!
2009-07-06T21:16:00.000Z	Kjell	GJ	btw was it alt + 1 or alt + f1?
2009-07-06T21:16:00.000Z	GJ	Kjell	Forgot to check honestly, but alt+f1 fired up my Ubuntu applications menu (from the panel)
