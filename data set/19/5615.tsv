2008-05-28T10:54:00.000Z	new2linux_	fde	i want the users on a room in xchat to be displayed permanently on the right side of the xchat windows
2008-05-28T10:54:00.000Z	new2linux_	fde	are there anyway to do it?
2008-05-28T10:55:00.000Z	new2linux_	fde	i've installed xchat on fedora and all the users was shown on the right side, not just icon of how many users on the room like in ubuntu
2008-05-28T10:56:00.000Z	fde	new2linux_	View > User List ... uncheck
2008-05-28T10:57:00.000Z	new2linux_	fde	Settings ->Preferences -> User List, no such user list option found

2008-05-28T11:00:00.000Z	new2linux_		i have the same question about the terminal as well
2008-05-28T11:00:00.000Z	new2linux_		carbonflux: how to use the xchat2? should i uninstall this version and install the new one?

2008-05-28T11:01:00.000Z	new2linux_		carbonflux: can't find xchat2 on the add/remove programs. Should i find it through google and get the package and use synaptic for the installation?
