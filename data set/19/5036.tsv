2008-10-04T23:34:00.000Z	homy		Hi. Can I download a package and all necessary dependencies within windows easily, so that I can then install them on ubuntu 8.04 standard desktop installation that doesn't have internet?
2008-10-04T23:35:00.000Z	homy		In my case, it is compiz-config-settings-manager.
2008-10-04T23:35:00.000Z	EvilDaemon	homy	no
2008-10-04T23:36:00.000Z	homy	EvilDaemon	can you tell me which dependencies I need to download from packages.ubuntu.org and which are already installed by default (compiz-config-settings-manager
2008-10-04T23:37:00.000Z	EvilDaemon	homy	Try looking around in here. http://packages.ubuntu.com/
2008-10-04T23:37:00.000Z	homy	EvilDaemon	yeah, but I don't know which packages are included by default.
2008-10-04T23:39:00.000Z	homy	EvilDaemon	ok, so "compizconfig-settings-manager" isn't installed by default.
2008-10-04T23:40:00.000Z	EvilDaemon	homy	nope, you need the package.
2008-10-04T23:40:00.000Z	homy	EvilDaemon	but do I also need its dependencies?
2008-10-04T23:41:00.000Z	EvilDaemon	homy	just get the main package you need. If it wants more, then get it whatever it wants. Pretty much,baby it.
2008-10-04T23:42:00.000Z	homy	EvilDaemon	the problem is, I don't have Internet on my ubuntu machine, so I have to download them from windows and then copy them on a usb stick.
2008-10-04T23:43:00.000Z	EvilDaemon	homy	so your sneakernetting it? Oh boy, your in for work. :p    Yeah, downoad the compizwhatever.DEB and copy it. Google the dependancies, and find out if it NEEDS it or not.
2008-10-04T23:44:00.000Z	homy	EvilDaemon	so it is really complicated?
2008-10-04T23:45:00.000Z	homy	EvilDaemon	I can't fix ethernet since the computer is in a room without ethernet or wlan.
2008-10-04T23:48:00.000Z	EvilDaemon	homy	Ah. Well, here's an example. ( http://packages.ubuntu.com/hardy/mail/archivemail ) It shows you the packages it depends on. Go get them, and download them too. Except not those, ou need to find the page for 'compiz settings manager' or whatever your are trying to locate. It's going to take a bit of work, mostly just waiting for the packages to download.
2008-10-04T23:49:00.000Z	homy	EvilDaemon	my problem is, how do I find out whether the package is installed by default on ubuntu?
2008-10-04T23:50:00.000Z	EvilDaemon	homy	If it's already installed on Ubuntu when you try to install it, it will tell you that it is, and you may delete your downloaded copy
2008-10-04T23:50:00.000Z	homy	EvilDaemon	so I have to download everything?
2008-10-04T23:51:00.000Z	homy	EvilDaemon	is there a windows program that allows me to downlao all that without clicking on every link manually
