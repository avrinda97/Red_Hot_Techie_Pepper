2010-09-05T16:02:00.000Z	schoolschool		anybody?
2010-09-05T16:04:00.000Z	schoolschool		ls: /dev/cdrom nu poate fi accesat: No such file or directory
2010-09-05T16:05:00.000Z	schoolschool		nope
2010-09-05T16:05:00.000Z	schoolschool		actually, i have no cdr or dvd in a grep dmesg
2010-09-05T16:05:00.000Z	schoolschool		so i guess it is a driver problem
2010-09-05T16:07:00.000Z	oCean_	schoolschool	find out if the system sees the device: sudo lshw -C disk
2010-09-05T16:08:00.000Z	schoolschool	oCean_	it lists only the hdd
2010-09-05T16:08:00.000Z	schoolschool	oCean_	no cdrom in there
2010-09-05T16:09:00.000Z	oCean_	schoolschool	but you did use the cdrom device for installing ubuntu?
2010-09-05T16:10:00.000Z	schoolschool	oCean_	after the installation, it worked for a time, and then somebody did something and now it is not working
2010-09-05T16:11:00.000Z	oCean_	schoolschool	the fact that it does not recognize the hardware might be something to worry about
2010-09-05T16:12:00.000Z	oCean_	schoolschool	your hdd is/are scsi?
2010-09-05T16:13:00.000Z	schoolschool	oCean_	, the hdd appears in the lsscsi listing
2010-09-05T16:13:00.000Z	oCean_	schoolschool	ok, so the required scsi drivers are loaded. In that case, it seems toe me it's an hardware issue
2010-09-05T16:14:00.000Z	schoolschool	oCean_	why do I then get the Cannot open SCSI driver! for the cdrecord -scanbus command
2010-09-05T16:15:00.000Z	schoolschool	oCean_	and there is no sr_mod module in the modprobe -l listing
2010-09-05T16:15:00.000Z	oCean_	schoolschool	I don't have sr listed, but I can use my scsi dvd
2010-09-05T16:16:00.000Z	oCean_	schoolschool	good idea
2010-09-05T16:17:00.000Z	schoolschool	oCean_	thank you very much . have a good day.
