2011-10-03T17:47:00.000Z	touson		Can anyone offer any guidance on the correct config for my xorg.conf file?
2011-10-03T17:47:00.000Z	usr13	touson	Don't use one
2011-10-03T17:50:00.000Z	usr13	touson	What display adapter are you using?
2011-10-03T17:51:00.000Z	usr13	touson	What does xrandr  say?  Show us:  xrandr | pastebinit  #And send resulting URL here.
2011-10-03T17:51:00.000Z	usr13	touson	Are you using a KVM switch?
2011-10-03T17:52:00.000Z	usr13	touson	Older PC?
2011-10-03T17:54:00.000Z	touson	usr13	just installing pastebinit
2011-10-03T17:56:00.000Z	touson	usr13	http://pastebin.com/X5Rk9jb1
2011-10-03T17:57:00.000Z	usr13	touson	Do you have a /etc/X11/xorg.conf file now?   (ls /etc/X11/xorg.conf )
2011-10-03T17:58:00.000Z	touson	usr13	here's my xorg.conf http://pastebin.com/X6ubpuC9
2011-10-03T17:59:00.000Z	usr13	touson	sudo mv /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.old
2011-10-03T17:59:00.000Z	usr13	touson	And then:  sudo service gdm restart
2011-10-03T18:00:00.000Z	touson	usr13	I logged into the main console (not into X) and ran X -configure as root.  It  created an xorg.conf.new file in /root, which I then copied to /etc/X11/xorg.conf after updating it with the display modes
2011-10-03T18:01:00.000Z	usr13	touson	Did you try running it without an xorg.conf file?
2011-10-03T18:03:00.000Z	touson	usr13	Just tried what you said and it's still the same i.e. only 800x600 available
2011-10-03T18:04:00.000Z	usr13	touson	Look at the output of /var/log/Xorg.0.log   and see what driver it is using.
2011-10-03T18:08:00.000Z	touson	usr13	Here's the content of /var/log/Xorg.0.log http://pastebin.com/Z0ifuKjw
2011-10-03T18:10:00.000Z	touson	usr13	I believe I am using the R128 driver
2011-10-03T18:14:00.000Z	touson	usr13	any thoughts?
