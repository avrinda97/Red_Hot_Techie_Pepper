2009-12-26T11:43:00.000Z	gaelfx	mota_	simply downloading ndiswrapper isn't enough, you need to use it to install the correct driver for your wireless card
2009-12-26T11:44:00.000Z	gaelfx	mota_	do you know what terminal is?
2009-12-26T11:45:00.000Z	gaelfx	mota_	when you type 'lspci' does it list your wireless card?
2009-12-26T11:47:00.000Z	gaelfx	mota_	can you pastebin the output of lspci for us?
2009-12-26T11:48:00.000Z	gaelfx	mota_	sorry, that was my fault a little bit, I should have been clearer about using pastebin
2009-12-26T11:49:00.000Z	gaelfx	mota_	no, but you need to use pastebin to post long messages like that
2009-12-26T11:51:00.000Z	gaelfx	mota_	do you know what brand the card is?
2009-12-26T11:54:00.000Z	gaelfx	mota_	it looks like you need broadcom drivers for that
2009-12-26T11:57:00.000Z	gaelfx	mota_	not a problem, that's what this channel is for
