2007-09-19T12:53:00.000Z	bluefox83	dystopianray	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37873/
2007-09-19T12:55:00.000Z	dystopianray	bluefox83	have al ook at this: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-source-2.6.20/+bug/123405
2007-09-19T12:57:00.000Z	bluefox83	dystopianray	not sure if that's the same error or not, and i'm not sure what caused mine
2007-09-19T13:09:00.000Z	bluefox83	dystopianray	how do i add multiple attachments to a bug report?
2007-09-19T13:10:00.000Z	dystopianray	bluefox83	add them one at a time
2007-09-19T13:11:00.000Z	bluefox83	dystopianray	as i add them, shoudl another box appear to add more? otherwise they will have like 5 different posts from me
2007-09-19T13:11:00.000Z	dystopianray	bluefox83	just add them as separate posts
2007-09-19T13:11:00.000Z	dystopianray	bluefox83	or maybe tar them up
2007-09-19T13:16:00.000Z	bluefox83	dystopianray	you think i should reboot like the error says, or leave my machine running?
2007-09-19T13:17:00.000Z	dystopianray	bluefox83	might be best to reboot
2007-09-19T13:18:00.000Z	bluefox83	dystopianray	it couldn't be anything like someone trying to attack my machine or something would it?
2007-09-19T13:18:00.000Z	dystopianray	bluefox83	the kswapd error? no i very much doubt thats anything to do with a remote attack
2007-09-19T13:18:00.000Z	bluefox83	dystopianray	ok. thanks
