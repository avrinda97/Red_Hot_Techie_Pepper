2009-06-21T03:55:00.000Z	SiDi		Is there a way to open the guest session from GDM ?
2009-06-21T03:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	SiDi	 not really. Its not made to work that way.
2009-06-21T03:56:00.000Z	SiDi	Dr_Willis	why so ?
2009-06-21T03:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	SiDi	 you could just add a user called guest if ya wanted. :)
2009-06-21T03:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	SiDi	 why what? Its not designed to be used from GDM. :)
2009-06-21T03:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	SiDi	 its a special temp type account.
2009-06-21T03:56:00.000Z	SiDi	Dr_Willis	if you have to use it from another session its just pointless to have it
2009-06-21T03:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	SiDi	 no its not.
2009-06-21T03:57:00.000Z	SiDi	Dr_Willis	usecase ?
2009-06-21T03:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	SiDi	 your at a airport.. someone wants to check their mail.. you have to specifically enable the special guest session. and when they leave.. eerything it did is deleted.
2009-06-21T03:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	SiDi	 its mentioned in the docs/forums
2009-06-21T03:58:00.000Z	SiDi	Dr_Willis	and you could aswell want to boot it from gdm cause you turn the pc on for the guest session, or you had your own session locked when the guest asks
2009-06-21T03:58:00.000Z	SiDi	Dr_Willis	in such a case you _also_ need to get access from gdm
2009-06-21T03:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	SiDi	 you coul make a user called 'guest' with password guest if you wanted.
2009-06-21T03:58:00.000Z	SiDi	Dr_Willis	thats not a guest session at all ;)
2009-06-21T03:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	SiDi	  I never said it was special :)
2009-06-21T03:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	SiDi	 but ive done it that way befor for the faimly
2009-06-21T04:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	SiDi	 your definition differes from what the ubuntu devs definiton is. :)
2009-06-21T04:02:00.000Z	SiDi	Dr_Willis	thanks
