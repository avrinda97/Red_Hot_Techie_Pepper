2009-05-16T11:46:00.000Z	Amaranth	nroot7	Looks like that bug is resolved, you just have to update your repo and then upgrade
2009-05-16T11:46:00.000Z	nroot7	Amaranth	I tried that, and it installed the broken packages
2009-05-16T11:47:00.000Z	Amaranth	nroot7	Then your mirror is out of date
2009-05-16T11:47:00.000Z	Amaranth	nroot7	Open up System->Administration->Software Sources and switch to the main server
2009-05-16T11:48:00.000Z	Amaranth	nroot7	The bug is resolved, you must not be updating before upgrading
2009-05-16T11:48:00.000Z	Amaranth	nroot7	What program are you using to upgrade?
2009-05-16T11:49:00.000Z	Amaranth	nroot7	sudo aptitude update
2009-05-16T11:54:00.000Z	nroot7	Amaranth	I'm trying reinstalling the linux-headers-2.6.28-12 files
2009-05-16T11:55:00.000Z	Amaranth	nroot7	sudo aptitude update && sudo aptitude dist-upgrade
2009-05-16T11:55:00.000Z	Amaranth	nroot7	Then reboot
2009-05-16T11:55:00.000Z	nroot7	Amaranth	ok, be back after reboot
2009-05-16T11:55:00.000Z	Amaranth	nroot7	The bug was linux-restricted-modules-2.6.28-12-generic did not exist, it now exists
2009-05-16T11:55:00.000Z	Amaranth	nroot7	The bug you linked to is fixed
2009-05-16T11:56:00.000Z	nroot7	Amaranth	I understand that completely, just that my broadcom doesnt seem to be in the mood to recover
2009-05-16T11:56:00.000Z	Amaranth	nroot7	that's because l-r-m only builds the kernel modules on boot
