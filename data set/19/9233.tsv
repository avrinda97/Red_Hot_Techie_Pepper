2006-12-20T09:56:00.000Z	mebaran151		a segfault is a program error
2006-12-20T09:56:00.000Z	mebaran151		do we still use memory management with segments?
2006-12-20T09:56:00.000Z	mebaran151		I thought that was an antiquated idea
2006-12-20T09:56:00.000Z	mebaran151		ah
2006-12-20T09:57:00.000Z	arrenlex	mebaran151	It's old terminology that has stuck around despite not applying anymore.
2006-12-20T09:57:00.000Z	mebaran151	arrenlex	that wouldn't even compile; you'd would need to make an error with malloc and free or something, or do some shifty pointer math
2006-12-20T09:57:00.000Z	mebaran151		ah
2006-12-20T09:58:00.000Z	mebaran151		sorry
2006-12-20T09:58:00.000Z	mebaran151		anyone here using a macbook?
2006-12-20T09:58:00.000Z	arrenlex	mebaran151	int main(void) {
2006-12-20T09:58:00.000Z	arrenlex		        int i;
2006-12-20T09:58:00.000Z	arrenlex		        i = "Hello";
2006-12-20T09:58:00.000Z	arrenlex		}
2006-12-20T09:58:00.000Z	arrenlex	mebaran151	gcc bob.c
2006-12-20T09:58:00.000Z	arrenlex		bob.c: In function main:
2006-12-20T09:58:00.000Z	arrenlex		bob.c:3: warning: assignment makes integer from pointer without a cast
2006-12-20T09:59:00.000Z	mebaran151		I never thought it would do it.... as I've never been so explicit
2006-12-20T09:59:00.000Z	mebaran151		pointer arithmetic is pretty evil
2006-12-20T10:00:00.000Z	arrenlex	mebaran151	Actually, that doesn't cause a segfault. I thought it did. But wikipedia has a two-line example that does: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmentation_fault
