2009-05-13T20:40:00.000Z	alberto2000	Jack_Sparrow	i just switched because of the 4gb ram whcih are not recognized with other kernel
2009-05-13T20:40:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	alberto2000	that did not answer my question
2009-05-13T20:41:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	alberto2000	did you run any scripts that did?

2009-05-13T20:44:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	alberto2000	clean like you said..  Was it slow with the standard kernel

2009-05-13T20:47:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	alberto2000	Have you run top to see what is sucking cpu cycles
2009-05-13T20:47:00.000Z	alberto2000	Jack_Sparrow	its mostly java (im using aptana ide) or firefox
2009-05-13T20:48:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	alberto2000	that did not answer my question
2009-05-13T20:48:00.000Z	alberto2000	Jack_Sparrow	well java is sucking RAM like shit and firefox too, but also cpu cycles sometimes
