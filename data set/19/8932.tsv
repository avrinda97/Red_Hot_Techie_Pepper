2007-02-21T07:38:00.000Z	whileimhere		Is there a stripped down version of Ubuntu that doesnt have all the extra apps like openoffice and gnomegames?
2007-02-21T07:39:00.000Z	whileimhere		With Ubuntu Server can Gnome be installed via apt ?
2007-02-21T07:40:00.000Z	unop	whileimhere	 there's a version of ubuntu (the netinstall) that has no graphical stuff at all .. you can install the base first and then add on what you need later
2008-07-09T01:57:00.000Z	unop	whileimhere	aptitude why-not gimp-print
2008-07-09T01:58:00.000Z	unop	whileimhere	aptitude why-not gimp-print
2008-07-09T02:00:00.000Z	whileimhere	unop	It returns i   gimp Conflicts gimp-print (<= 5.0.1-3)
2008-07-09T02:02:00.000Z	unop	whileimhere	it seems that this package you want to install depends on gimp-print that the current gimp conflicts with -- you'll either have to downgrade gimp or force your package to be installed
2008-07-21T05:13:00.000Z	unop	whileimhere	apt-cache depends ubuntu-desktop  - gives you a list of packages that are pulled in when installing it .. you can then put them in a text file, edit the text file to your needs and have apt-get read from that text file
2008-07-21T05:17:00.000Z	unop	whileimhere	depends on how much you install really, on a basic installation - 5GB suffices
2008-07-21T05:22:00.000Z	unop	whileimhere	if you have disk space to spare, you can always mount that free space that into / and move directories onto those partitions
2008-07-21T05:24:00.000Z	unop	whileimhere	a separate /home partition is a good idea, yea
2008-08-22T21:47:00.000Z	unop	whileimhere	yes.. that's the purpose of the server edition
2008-08-22T21:48:00.000Z	whileimhere	unop	I am going to turn my old PC into a MAME machine but don't want any heavy desktop. I figure I can install Fluxbox for taht.
2008-08-22T21:48:00.000Z	unop	whileimhere	backports are new software that has been compiled for the current release that should actually only make it in the next one .. usually because of demand.
2008-08-22T21:53:00.000Z	unop	whileimhere	mkdir
2008-08-22T21:59:00.000Z	unop	whileimhere	try epiphany and galeon
2009-01-17T19:05:00.000Z	unop	whileimhere	cd directory && rename '$_ = lc' *
2009-01-17T19:08:00.000Z	unop	whileimhere	 or:  cd directory && for i in *; do j=$(tr [A-Z] [a-z] <<<"$i");  mv "$i" "$j"; done
2009-01-17T19:09:00.000Z	unop	whileimhere	make a backup of your files first tho.
