2007-11-20T07:04:00.000Z	nanbud1		Are we any near to making gutsy bug free on athlon computers? freezeups and corrupted graphics?
2007-11-20T07:04:00.000Z	crdlb	nanbud1	that's a problem with your video driver, not your CPU
2007-11-20T07:05:00.000Z	nanbud1	crdlb	many ppl are facing problems and i am not sure if its video driver. but since i am just a hobbyist could u help me out? i dont have any seperate video card
2007-11-20T07:06:00.000Z	crdlb	nanbud1	what does "lspci | grep VGA" say?
2007-11-20T07:06:00.000Z	nanbud1		the freeze ups happens when hard disk comes under load, like two programs trying to startup or downloading something
2007-11-20T07:06:00.000Z	nanbud1		just a moment i ll chk
2007-11-20T07:07:00.000Z	nanbud1		it says this:   01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: Silicon Integrated Systems [SiS] 661/741/760 PCI/AGP or 662/761Gx PCIE VGA Display Adapter
2007-11-20T07:08:00.000Z	crdlb	nanbud1	there are no good drivers for that card :(
2007-11-20T07:09:00.000Z	nanbud1	crdlb	do u think the freeze ups could be because of this card too?
2007-11-20T07:09:00.000Z	crdlb	nanbud1	that would be my guess
2007-11-20T07:10:00.000Z	nanbud1		can anything be done? like adding something extra in my hardware? maybe some cheap extra,but reliable card?
2007-11-20T07:11:00.000Z	crdlb	nanbud1	well yes you could get a cheap nvidia card or something
2007-11-20T07:11:00.000Z	crdlb		!doesntwork | soek
2007-11-20T07:11:00.000Z	nanbud1	crdlb	nvidia card would takeover the function of all the graphics? i mean with that in place the present card would not be used by the OS?
2007-11-20T07:12:00.000Z	crdlb	nanbud1	there's often an option in the BIOS menu to deactivate the builtin video chip
2007-11-20T07:12:00.000Z	crdlb		although even if you don't do that, you can manually configure it to use the new card
2007-11-20T07:12:00.000Z	nanbud1	crdlb	Ah! BIOS, i ll check it out. just so that i understand better, this present card is built in on the motherboard right?
2007-11-20T07:13:00.000Z	crdlb	nanbud1	yup
2007-11-20T07:13:00.000Z	nanbud1	crdlb	thanks so much for the help, i appreciate it. i ll try out the solution
