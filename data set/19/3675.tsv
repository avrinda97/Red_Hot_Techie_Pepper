2010-08-31T22:29:00.000Z	volume		Great! GParted is warning me that it is "Unable to read the contents of this file system!" (The drive I just formated.)
2010-08-31T22:30:00.000Z	janisozaur	volume	have you actually made file system there or just created a partition?
2010-08-31T22:31:00.000Z	volume	janisozaur	I'm getting that error on the first partition, not the second. (sda1)
2010-08-31T22:32:00.000Z	volume	janisozaur	- sda2 is showing that it has files on it. I set it as my primary partition. Maybe I shouldn't have done that. sda1 is showing empy, with an error saying that it can't be read.
2010-08-31T22:32:00.000Z	janisozaur	volume	what does fdisk say?
2010-08-31T22:33:00.000Z	volume	janisozaur	- I'm not running fdisk. Can I do that from within gParted?
2010-08-31T22:34:00.000Z	janisozaur	volume	no idea. are you using ubuntu live or what?
2010-08-31T22:34:00.000Z	janisozaur	volume	you can try palimpsest
2010-08-31T22:34:00.000Z	volume	janisozaur	I'm running GParted distribution right now, just for formating and partitioning
2010-08-31T22:35:00.000Z	janisozaur	volume	sorry, no idea about gparted capabilities. from my experience though, after creating partitions you have to plant file system there, though gparted could automate it, however.
2010-08-31T22:36:00.000Z	janisozaur	volume	btw, wouldn't it be better to run ubuntu live instead of gparted? i mean - i believe ubuntu live has gparted and so much more. is there any reason to use gparted's own? (just asking)
2010-08-31T22:49:00.000Z	janisozaur	volume	usb-creator-gtk
2010-08-31T22:49:00.000Z	volume	janisozaur	- does that come with Ubuntu?
2010-08-31T22:49:00.000Z	janisozaur	volume	yes, by default
2010-08-31T22:52:00.000Z	volume	janisozaur	I'm going to need to create in install USB, but all I have is a version of ubuntu that is old, or x86 (my pc is x64). SO I'm going to have to create an bootable USB of a version of Ubuntu I don't have. So I'll have to download it. Does usb-creator-gtk let me do that?
2010-08-31T22:53:00.000Z	janisozaur	volume	you'll have to download iso yourself, once you have the image just point the program to it
2010-08-31T22:53:00.000Z	volume	janisozaur	-- great. cool.
2010-08-31T23:01:00.000Z	volume	janisozaur	-- thanks for the help. JK_ you too.
2010-08-31T23:01:00.000Z	janisozaur	volume	yw
