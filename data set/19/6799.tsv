2007-12-05T21:06:00.000Z	xactly		my mp3 player is actually an MP4 player
2007-12-05T21:06:00.000Z	xactly		i plays music, video clips and displays pictures
2007-12-05T21:07:00.000Z	xactly		the brand is Sansa
2007-12-05T21:07:00.000Z	xactly		from SanDisk
2007-12-05T21:08:00.000Z	xactly		okay so the brand is SanDisk
2007-12-05T21:08:00.000Z	xactly		please check the link for more info
2007-12-05T21:09:00.000Z	xactly		i presume that my MP3 player is not supported by Ubuntu 7.10?
2007-12-05T21:09:00.000Z	xactly		i'll try that
2007-12-05T21:09:00.000Z	void^	xactly	i have a sansa e250 (should be same as yours with 2gb instead of 4). works just fine.
2007-12-05T21:10:00.000Z	xactly	void^	do you have the USB Mode on the player set to MSC or MSP?
2007-12-05T21:11:00.000Z	void^	xactly	both work. it's simpler to use msc, you can just move and delete files on it. if you use mtp you need to use extra software to transfer files, music players like amarok support it.
2007-12-05T21:12:00.000Z	xactly	void^	is the Rhythmbox sufficient for synchronising my mp3 player?
2007-12-05T21:12:00.000Z	void^	xactly	no idea, never used it. if it supports mtp it should work as well.
2007-12-05T21:14:00.000Z	xactly	void^	i have bought a 1 Gig microSD memory card
2007-12-05T21:15:00.000Z	xactly	void^	how do you transfer music to that memory card?
2007-12-05T21:15:00.000Z	void^	xactly	might need to use msc mode to access it, should show up as an extra partition i think.. but not sure, i don't have any microsd cards
2007-12-05T21:15:00.000Z	xactly	void^	is that done automatically after the players own space is consumed?
