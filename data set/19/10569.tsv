2008-11-17T10:46:00.000Z	deb		hi  can anyone tell me what the hardware requirements are for ubuntu  specifically how much ram is needed ??
2008-11-17T10:46:00.000Z	nickrud	deb	512mb will let you run (barely) 768 and above is much better
2008-11-17T10:52:00.000Z	nickrud	deb	if you've already burned them, there's a disk check option on the startup menu of the cd
2008-11-17T11:07:00.000Z	nickrud	deb	basically cuz the disk has it's own checker in the startup menu. the md5sum check is done on the downloaded iso before you burn.
2008-11-17T11:15:00.000Z	deb	nickrud	  how do i check via cd   when i instert them into drive it shows contents  Does the machine need to be shut down and brought up with cd in drive ?
2008-11-17T11:15:00.000Z	nickrud	deb	yes
2008-11-17T11:15:00.000Z	nickrud	deb	is this a vista machine you're going to install ubuntu on?
2008-11-17T11:19:00.000Z	deb	nickrud	 no i have ubuntu 6.04 LTS standalone now and want to upgrade the os
2008-11-17T11:19:00.000Z	nickrud	deb	ah, what did you download?
2008-11-17T11:19:00.000Z	nickrud	deb	8.10 or 8.04?
2008-11-17T11:21:00.000Z	nickrud	deb	it really matters about what you downloaded: you can go directly from 6.04(6) to 8.04, but not to 8.10.
2008-11-17T11:22:00.000Z	nickrud	deb	I would suggest going from 6.04 to 8.04, if you want to upgrade. However, you can back up your $HOME and do !clone to get your package list, then do a fresh 8.10 install. I'd slightly recommend that
2008-11-17T11:24:00.000Z	deb	nickrud	what is that !clone to get package list ??
2008-11-17T11:33:00.000Z	deb	nickrud	 if i were to upgrade from 6.04 to 8.04 how would I do that?  Or is there an option on the 8.04 cd for that ?
2008-11-17T11:34:00.000Z	nickrud	deb	when you insert the 8.04 disk into the machine while 6.04 is running, it should offer to upgrade
2008-11-17T11:35:00.000Z	nickrud	deb	if it doesn't, try running    update-manager -c    in a terminal
2008-11-17T11:35:00.000Z	deb	nickrud	 would all the packages that I am currently using still remain in the upgrade ?
2008-11-17T11:36:00.000Z	nickrud	deb	yes, it'll upgrade everything, from the kernel to openoffice
2008-11-17T11:36:00.000Z	nickrud	deb	even stuff that has been dropped (that is, was in 6.04 but is not in 8.04) will stay on your machine.
