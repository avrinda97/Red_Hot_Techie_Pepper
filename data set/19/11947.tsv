2006-03-14T07:45:00.000Z	neil	LjL	This is ubuntu_ from a couple minutes ago
2006-03-14T07:46:00.000Z	neil	LjL	I've logged in now from the command prompt
2006-03-14T07:46:00.000Z	LjL	neil	ok, press alt+f2 (alt+f1 will get you back) and try "sudo /etc/init.d/gdm start"
2006-03-14T07:47:00.000Z	neil	LjL	It gave me a fail message for that command
2006-03-14T07:48:00.000Z	LjL	neil	did it say anything more specific, or just that it failed?
2006-03-14T07:48:00.000Z	neil	LjL	"Starting GNOME display manager....           [fail] "
2006-03-14T07:49:00.000Z	LjL	neil	i see. try "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg", it will ask you a few questions, most of which can probably be answered by just pressing Enter and using the default answer (but do check what they're asking). when it asks about resolutions that you want to use, choose a "safe" one, like 800x600
2006-03-14T07:51:00.000Z	LjL	neil	oh, i mean, make sure you choose *only* that one safe resolution, and that all others are unchecked
2006-03-14T07:57:00.000Z	neil	LjL	so I did that... and now I'm back to a command prompt
2006-03-14T07:57:00.000Z	LjL	neil	try sudo /etc/init.d/gdm start again
2006-03-14T08:00:00.000Z	neil	LjL	It failed again
2006-03-14T08:01:00.000Z	LjL	neil	don't really know what is going on. you could try "sudo apt-get update" and then "sudo apt-get dist-upgrade" to download any updates/fixes that were released
2006-03-14T08:02:00.000Z	neil	LjL	could it have something to do with having an nVidia card?
2006-03-14T08:03:00.000Z	LjL	neil	don't think. if it's working with the live cd, it should be working on your HD too
2006-03-14T08:03:00.000Z	LjL	neil	my opinion is that something went wrong during install
2006-03-14T08:03:00.000Z	neil	LjL	okay, well i'll see what I can do with another install
2006-03-14T08:04:00.000Z	LjL	neil	i'd give the dist-upgrade a try first tho
2006-03-14T08:04:00.000Z	neil	LjL	ya, i will
2006-03-14T08:04:00.000Z	LjL	neil	at least if you've got a faster connection, otherwise it may be quicker to reinstall
