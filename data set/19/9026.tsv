2007-03-06T12:45:00.000Z	leros		i did sudo apt-get install network-manager-gnome and it seemed to have installed, but when i restarted there were no noticable changes
2007-03-06T12:45:00.000Z	leros		ok, let me reinstall nm
2007-03-06T12:46:00.000Z	leros		oh, that worked

2007-03-06T09:30:00.000Z	leros		My pointer bounces when I put it near the edge of my screen. Is there anyway to stop this? Its causing problems for synergy.
2007-03-06T09:31:00.000Z	leros		dr_willis, like it bounces a few pixels of the edge. Instead of just sitting there
2007-03-06T09:33:00.000Z	ikonia_	leros	you need an X server running on your local machine
