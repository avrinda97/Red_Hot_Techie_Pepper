2009-01-11T17:36:00.000Z	beli	SmokeyD	why are you using tripwire btw? i would user aide or samhain
2009-01-11T17:37:00.000Z	SmokeyD	beli	because I know tripwire and don't know the others
2009-01-11T17:37:00.000Z	beli	SmokeyD	ok :)
2009-01-11T17:38:00.000Z	SmokeyD	beli	are they good? Are they purely integrity checkers or do they do more?
2009-01-11T17:41:00.000Z	SmokeyD	beli	samhain also does other intrusion detection i read? So wouldn't be usefull if I already run snort as wel right?
2009-01-11T17:43:00.000Z	beli	SmokeyD	aide is the free tripwire replacement....samhain CAN do more stuff....i use samhain and beltane
2009-01-11T17:43:00.000Z	SmokeyD	beli	tripwire is also open source again
2009-01-11T17:44:00.000Z	beli	SmokeyD	yeah...but its a bit bloated in my eyes
2009-01-11T17:45:00.000Z	beli	SmokeyD	look at the beltane web gui for samhain
2009-01-11T17:45:00.000Z	beli	SmokeyD	i love it
2009-01-11T17:45:00.000Z	beli	SmokeyD	and that is a console guy telling to you ;)
2009-01-11T17:46:00.000Z	SmokeyD	beli	:)
2009-01-11T17:54:00.000Z	beli	SmokeyD	samhain can do signed stuff...like signed db and logs
2009-01-11T17:49:00.000Z	SmokeyD	beli	I like the combination of snort and base
2009-01-11T17:50:00.000Z	SmokeyD	beli	and I wrote a script that alerts me on google talk of snort alerts
2009-01-11T17:51:00.000Z	beli	SmokeyD	you would like beltane too then
2009-01-11T17:51:00.000Z	beli	SmokeyD	do you run it for a single server or for a server farm? load balancing/clustering?
2009-01-11T17:52:00.000Z	SmokeyD	beli	single server
2009-01-11T17:56:00.000Z	beli	SmokeyD	you can use gnupg for example...
