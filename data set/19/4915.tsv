2009-06-26T08:52:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dekkong	Banshee
2009-06-26T08:52:00.000Z	dekkong	sebsebseb	thx
2009-06-26T08:52:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dekkong	or Rythombox
2009-06-26T08:54:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dekkong	ctmjr  has a point, maybe it's not that lite, but it will work with like anything, and it's also currently the best player in my opinion, even though it uses Mono hum
2009-06-26T08:54:00.000Z	dekkong	sebsebseb	okey.. can it handle DAAP?
2009-06-26T08:55:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dekkong	DAAP you mean?
2009-06-26T08:55:00.000Z	dekkong	sebsebseb	yeah
2009-06-26T08:56:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dekkong	no as in, what's DAAP?
2009-06-26T08:56:00.000Z	dekkong	sebsebseb	yeah it works
2009-06-26T08:56:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dekkong	well  Banshee works with most audio and video stuff,  don't know what DAAP is though, but  could Google that
2009-06-26T08:57:00.000Z	dekkong	sebsebseb	I already noticed that DAAP is enabled so :)
2009-06-26T08:57:00.000Z	dekkong	sebsebseb	it works :)
2009-06-26T08:57:00.000Z	dekkong	sebsebseb	btw is banshee built on rythmbox?
2009-06-26T08:58:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dekkong	no Banshee uses something called Mono,  which is a kind of port of  Microsoft .NET to Linux,  which is also why some people that use Linux don't like it
2009-06-26T08:59:00.000Z	dekkong	sebsebseb	ok :) I thought beacause it looks quite like rythmbox
2009-06-26T08:59:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dekkong	Rythombox is the default player in Ubuntu, but it's also the default for the Gnome desktop environment :)  which Ubuntu is using
2009-06-26T09:00:00.000Z	dekkong	sebsebseb	yepp but they look almost the same :)
2009-06-26T09:00:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dekkong	indeed
