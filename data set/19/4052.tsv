2009-04-11T07:46:00.000Z	h8red		can someone point me to a good website with very basic explanations of linux terminal commands?
2009-04-11T07:46:00.000Z	h8red		i'm used to using a command prompt, but in DOS
2009-04-11T07:46:00.000Z	h8red		linux is completely new to me :(
2009-04-11T07:48:00.000Z	h8red		Whatever commands I've entered I've typed off the web
2009-04-11T07:48:00.000Z	h8red		I have no idea what I'm typing
2009-04-11T07:48:00.000Z	h8red		cool thanks
2009-04-11T07:49:00.000Z	h8red		been a windows power user for a long time, having patience being a newb all over again is hard hehe
2009-04-11T07:49:00.000Z	matrixblue_	h8red	download the ubuntu pocket guide
2009-04-11T07:49:00.000Z	matrixblue_	h8red	and read a new issues of fullcircle magazine
2009-04-11T08:06:00.000Z	matrixblue_	h8red	sudo apt-get install mplayer
2009-04-11T08:07:00.000Z	matrixblue_	h8red	I like smplayer which is a front end to mplayer (gives better controls)
2009-04-11T08:12:00.000Z	matrixblue_	h8red	keep vlc player
2009-04-11T08:13:00.000Z	matrixblue_	h8red	it can play some stuff that mplayer can;t
2009-04-11T08:13:00.000Z	matrixblue_	h8red	I'd remove everything except mplayer and VLC
2009-04-11T08:14:00.000Z	matrixblue_	h8red	for mp3 go with Banshee
2009-04-11T08:16:00.000Z	matrixblue_	h8red	they'll be good unless you want playlists, shuffle, iPod sync, etc
