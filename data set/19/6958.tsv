2007-11-02T19:32:00.000Z	Jonah_		hey guys i installed a driver but it's screwed my system up and now can't do anything, so is there a way i can delete this driver from recovery mode? please can someone help me out
2007-11-02T19:33:00.000Z	manchicken	Jonah_	Is it an ATI driver?  I've never gotten one of those to work properly.
2007-11-02T19:34:00.000Z	Jonah_	manchicken	no it's a wifi driver, my wifi was kinda working but wasnt very good, so i tried to install a different driver from source and it's killed my machine
2007-11-02T19:35:00.000Z	manchicken	Jonah_	Ah.  Sorry, I've never had any trouble with wifi drivers...
2007-11-02T19:35:00.000Z	manchicken	Jonah_	`make uninstall` maybe
2007-11-02T19:36:00.000Z	manchicken	Jonah_	You could also blacklist it if that doesn't work.
2007-11-02T19:39:00.000Z	manchicken	Jonah_	Go back to the source directory where you did the `make install` and do a `make uninstall`
2007-11-02T19:39:00.000Z	Jonah_	manchicken	i'm in dir that i did the make install
2007-11-02T19:39:00.000Z	manchicken	Jonah_	Try `make deinstall` (that's the BSD way)
2007-11-02T19:40:00.000Z	Jonah_	manchicken	same error
2007-11-02T19:40:00.000Z	manchicken	Jonah_	Did you try `make deinstall`?
2007-11-02T19:41:00.000Z	manchicken	Jonah_	What driver did you install?
2007-11-02T19:41:00.000Z	manchicken	Jonah_	Try going back to their webpage and seeing if they have any docs on how to remove it.
2007-11-02T19:42:00.000Z	Jonah_	manchicken	this one: http://rt2x00.serialmonkey.com/rt61-cvs-daily.tar.gz
2007-11-02T19:42:00.000Z	Jonah_	manchicken	there doesn't seem to be anything about that
2007-11-02T19:43:00.000Z	manchicken	Jonah_	Is there a README or something like that in the directory?
2007-11-02T19:43:00.000Z	Jonah_	manchicken	yeah but nothing about removing in readme
2007-11-02T19:47:00.000Z	manchicken	Jonah_	Read the Makefile and see if there's anything in there.  I've gotta go for now.  Good luck.
2007-11-02T19:47:00.000Z	Jonah_	manchicken	ok thanks
