2006-11-04T12:25:00.000Z	savvas	inc|freaky	when you reinstall it, try the install -f again
2006-11-04T12:25:00.000Z	inc|freaky	savvas	it all doesnt work ive tried both allready
2006-11-04T12:26:00.000Z	savvas	inc|freaky	you mean you can't reinstall it?
2006-11-04T12:28:00.000Z	savvas	inc|freaky	sudo apt-get install courier-authlib && sudo apt-get install --reinstall courier-authdaemon
2006-11-04T12:29:00.000Z	savvas	inc|freaky	if that doesn't work, try reinstalling: sudo apt-get install --reinstall courier-authlib && sudo apt-get install --reinstall courier-authdaemon
2006-11-04T12:29:00.000Z	inc|freaky	savvas	both dont work.
2006-11-04T12:30:00.000Z	savvas	inc|freaky	can you show me the error please?
2006-11-04T12:30:00.000Z	inc|freaky	savvas	its the "error processing package courier-authdaemon package in inconsistent state reinstall before removal" one.
2006-11-04T12:31:00.000Z	savvas	inc|freaky	is the courier-authlib installed now?
2006-11-04T12:31:00.000Z	inc|freaky	savvas	no both dont work
2006-11-04T12:31:00.000Z	savvas	inc|freaky	might i ask how did you install that package without dependencies in the first place? :P
2006-11-04T12:32:00.000Z	inc|freaky	savvas	i dont know i did: apt-get dist-upgrade after changing dapper to edgy in /etc/apt/sources.list
2006-11-04T12:33:00.000Z	savvas	inc|freaky	first you do dist-upgrade, then switch to edgy
2006-11-04T12:34:00.000Z	inc|freaky	savvas	you do a upgrade to edgy by doing that. and since i tried to upgrade i get that error the kernel cant be booted too but i now use a rescue system from the network
2006-11-04T12:35:00.000Z	savvas	inc|freaky	try downloading the alternate cd and updating from there
