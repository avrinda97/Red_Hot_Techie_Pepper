2010-05-22T21:26:00.000Z	ceno		hey guys
2010-05-22T21:26:00.000Z	ceno		does anyone know if it's possible to assign a virtual desktop to an external monitor?
2010-05-22T21:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ceno	 you can extend a desktop across.. it might be possible with some other window managers (perhaps E17) but not with gnome
2010-05-22T21:28:00.000Z	ceno	Dr_Willis	what about compiz? is it worth fiddling with the options?
2010-05-22T21:31:00.000Z	ceno	Dr_Willis	thx anyway, you saved me a great deal of googling, cheers!
2010-05-22T21:55:00.000Z	ceno	Dr_Willis	remember I asked you 10minutes ago how to assign a virtual deskop to an external monitor and you said not possible? I found a workaround : )
2010-05-22T21:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ceno	  i said that e17 may  be able to. but i have not seen it done in gnome
2010-05-22T21:56:00.000Z	ceno	Dr_Willis	well yeah, I meant in gnome, implicitly
2010-05-22T21:56:00.000Z	ceno	Dr_Willis	that works, but I want my external monitor to run moovida so i can stream music from grooveshark
2010-05-22T21:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ceno	 i just drag moovidia to my 2nd monitor and fullscreen it. :)
2010-05-22T21:57:00.000Z	ceno	Dr_Willis	but then when you change you virtual desktop, moovida disappears
2010-05-22T21:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ceno	 err.. use the 'sticky' option
2010-06-06T20:16:00.000Z	ceno	Dr_Willis	that would certainly impress my friends of the power of linux
2010-06-23T16:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ceno	 when you format it to be ext4. it should make/enable the journal.
2010-06-23T16:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ceno	 if you disable the journal.. well.. Not sure thats possible.
2010-06-23T16:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ceno	 that would basically be ext3 + some features.. which may not be doable IF it was allready formated as ext4
2010-06-23T16:41:00.000Z	ceno	Dr_Willis	I *think* it's possible, I think I saw a tutorial on a blog once, but I honestly don't remember. I think journaling is ruining performance on my system and I'd like to test it O_o
2010-06-23T16:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ceno	 i dont  think that would be the case.  I do recall reading on the wiki page for ext4 that ext4 is 'partially' backwards compatiable with ext3/2 there are features that you may be using in ext4 that would make it impossible for you to 'downgrade' it to ext2/3
2010-06-23T16:45:00.000Z	ceno	Dr_Willis	ok, I'll keep digging for information
