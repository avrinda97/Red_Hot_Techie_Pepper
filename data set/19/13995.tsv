2004-12-30T10:25:00.000Z	bitserf	discord	http://rafb.net/paste/results/RG9wHi57.txt <-- put this in /etc/hal/preferences.fdi, and you'll magically get your iPod labeled as "iPod" as well :)
2004-12-30T10:25:00.000Z	bitserf		woops, /etc/hal/fdi/preferences.fdi, that is
2004-12-30T10:26:00.000Z	discord		why do i want to do that?
2004-12-30T10:26:00.000Z	discord	bitserf	do you have an ipod
2004-12-30T10:26:00.000Z	discord	bitserf	are you using gtkpod?
2004-12-30T10:26:00.000Z	bitserf	discord	yes, i do
2004-12-30T10:26:00.000Z	bitserf	discord	yep.
2004-12-30T10:27:00.000Z	discord		do you get the message about the sorting bug when you start gtkpod?
2004-12-30T10:27:00.000Z	bitserf	discord	yep, something about not being able to use extended information?
2004-12-30T10:27:00.000Z	discord	bitserf	i got that and something else also
2004-12-30T10:28:00.000Z	discord	bitserf	Cannot unsort track view because of a bug in the GTK lib you are using (2.4.10 < 2.5.4). Once you sort the track view, you cannot go back to the unsorted state.
2004-12-30T10:28:00.000Z	bitserf	discord	ahh, i didn't get that because i'm running hoary, which has GTK 2.5.6
