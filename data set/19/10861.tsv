2008-09-22T09:33:00.000Z	r3c0n		from vmware
2008-09-22T09:33:00.000Z	r3c0n		i think there is a vmware for linux right ?
2008-09-22T09:33:00.000Z	XiXaQ	r3c0n	it's not recommendable to run such applications under vmware.
2008-09-22T09:33:00.000Z	XiXaQ	r3c0n	there is a vmware for linux, yes. There are other virtualization solutions too.
2008-09-22T09:37:00.000Z	XiXaQ	r3c0n	bad idea.
2008-09-22T09:44:00.000Z	XiXaQ	r3c0n	you can use startup manager, or edit /boot/grub/menu.lst
2008-09-22T09:45:00.000Z	XiXaQ	r3c0n	wireless is nice. Drivers are difficult when the manufacturers won't make drivers for their hardware.
2008-09-22T09:46:00.000Z	XiXaQ	r3c0n	it's not legal. It can't be done.
2008-09-22T09:47:00.000Z	XiXaQ	r3c0n	I don't understand that question.
2008-09-22T09:48:00.000Z	XiXaQ	r3c0n	did you read my last message?
2008-09-22T09:48:00.000Z	XiXaQ	r3c0n	look for it then.
2008-09-22T09:49:00.000Z	XiXaQ	r3c0n	I repeated it for you when you got back.
2008-09-22T09:55:00.000Z	XiXaQ	r3c0n	lilo and grub are competing boot managers?
