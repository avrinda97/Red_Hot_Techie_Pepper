2006-04-24T05:07:00.000Z	gverig		is there a good and dynamic way to integrate file browser with Win network (Samba). I tried Nautilus and it kinda worked but it was a nightmare
2006-04-24T05:08:00.000Z	kingspawn	gverig	merge all the windows computers to linux! ( ;) )
2006-04-24T05:08:00.000Z	gverig	kingspawn	would love to. Not an option (corporate network)
2006-04-24T05:09:00.000Z	kingspawn	gverig	hehe, just playing around. what kind of nightmare did you encounter?
2006-04-24T05:10:00.000Z	gverig	kingspawn	well, 1) it was slow as hell 2) it does not provide even a temporary mount so no other program can open these files (at least TextEdit could not) and it crashed with SIGFAULT at the end (leaving some virtual FS 128M heavy)
2006-04-24T05:11:00.000Z	kingspawn	gverig	hot diggity, thats not the usual behaviour. how have you got your samba set up? everything else on the network working alright?
2006-04-24T05:12:00.000Z	gverig	kingspawn	Yeah, network is reasonably stable. I am not sure what you mean about samba setup
2006-04-24T05:13:00.000Z	kingspawn	gverig	well, i would think you have set up samba in some way to access windows shares
2006-04-24T05:13:00.000Z	gverig	kingspawn	generally that box is in a domain but the resource I was accessing is "free for all" access. So I was able to see it but when I clicked "open in TextEdit" it opened a program with location som smb://..., which it obviously did not understand
2006-04-24T05:13:00.000Z	gverig	kingspawn	... I just installed samba, I did not set anything up
2006-04-24T05:14:00.000Z	gverig	kingspawn	if I use smbmount everything works great (I do that all the time). I just need a way to access other (rarely used) servers on the net
2006-04-24T05:15:00.000Z	kingspawn	gverig	ah, i see
2006-04-24T05:15:00.000Z	kingspawn	gverig	well, quickest way out i can see is a small script that mounts up the not-so-often used shares
2006-04-24T05:15:00.000Z	kingspawn	gverig	but there might be better ways
2006-04-24T05:16:00.000Z	gverig	kingspawn	yeah, I have a quick script that mounts *often* used shares. I cannot mount all rarely used machines - there are several hundreds of those :)
2006-04-24T05:16:00.000Z	gverig	kingspawn	Anyway, not a big deal, I did not expect this solved.
2006-04-24T05:16:00.000Z	kingspawn	gverig	hm, i see. heh, no, its a weird problem, and i havent used a windows share in ages. at least not one like the ones you are describing.
2006-04-24T05:17:00.000Z	gverig	kingspawn	Although it would be nice to get some kind of smbmount plugin for nautilus, something like "mount drive" in windows. current way did not work for me (can't say that it sucks, maybe it works good in different scenarios... sucked for me though ;) )
2006-04-24T05:18:00.000Z	kingspawn	gverig	heh, yeah, i feel you. sometimes those things just go nuts on you
