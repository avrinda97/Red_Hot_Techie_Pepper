2010-06-24T06:59:00.000Z	yillkid		Hi ... I have a question . :)
2010-06-24T06:59:00.000Z	yillkid		I want to chroot to a directory and run a shell script on here .
2010-06-24T06:59:00.000Z	yillkid		So my command is : cp my_shell /target_mount_point ; chroot /target_mount_point /bin/bash /my_shell
2010-06-24T07:00:00.000Z	boolean	yillkid	u will need to ensure that the shell script is within that chrooted dir
2010-06-24T07:01:00.000Z	yillkid	boolean	Yes, I am sure, the script is excuting sucesslly, but I ust can't chroot to the target.
2010-06-24T07:01:00.000Z	yillkid	boolean	I still in my host root .
2010-06-24T07:03:00.000Z	boolean	yillkid	when you chroot a dir that dir become / ( root )
2010-06-24T07:03:00.000Z	yillkid	boolean	yes, I know . :)
2010-06-24T07:03:00.000Z	boolean	yillkid	take a look around see if the dir structure is the same after the chroot
2010-06-24T07:03:00.000Z	yillkid	boolean	no, not tha same .
2010-06-24T07:04:00.000Z	boolean	yillkid	then your chroot worked!
2010-06-24T07:04:00.000Z	yillkid	boolean	the script have run, but I still int the host .
2010-06-24T07:04:00.000Z	yillkid	boolean	Sorry, I have still in the host.
2010-06-24T07:06:00.000Z	yillkid	boolean	Sorry, the shell must run in the target.
2010-06-24T07:07:00.000Z	yillkid	boolean	the content of "/" directory is the same, I am sure still in the host .
2010-06-24T07:08:00.000Z	yillkid	boolean	for example .
2010-06-24T07:09:00.000Z	yillkid	boolean	chroot /mnt/temp ls   <----- ls will list all "target" content, but I still in the host.
2010-06-24T07:10:00.000Z	yillkid	boolean	I want to chroot to the target AND run ls
