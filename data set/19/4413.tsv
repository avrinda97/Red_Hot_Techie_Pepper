2009-08-01T14:37:00.000Z	tbaxter		[One and only one repost] [On my dual boot] Can someone help me with why files and folders I create on a vfat partition in linux can't be viewed when I boot into vista?
2009-08-01T14:37:00.000Z	allquixotic	tbaxter	Works for me -- are you running `sync` or properly unmounting the device before you reboot?
2009-08-01T14:40:00.000Z	tbaxter	allquixotic	neither (unless it happens on an out-of-the-box install). I'd never considered that it would be something that was necessary. (sorry, forgot to put your name in it)
2009-08-01T14:41:00.000Z	allquixotic	tbaxter	Well, usually on a "safe" reboot, the system should automatically unmount drives and perform a full sync, but with removable media I always unmount it in Nautilus just to be sure
2009-08-01T14:42:00.000Z	tbaxter	allquixotic	it's not removable. it's just a partition on the internal dirve of my lapto.
2009-08-01T14:42:00.000Z	allquixotic	tbaxter	To dig deeper, though, you might consider using ntfs as a more viable means of file transfer between Ubuntu and Windows. ntfs-3g is extremely stable and feature-complete nowadays.
2009-08-01T14:42:00.000Z	allquixotic	tbaxter	If you have a vfat partition and you are intending to use that partition only as a means of file sharing between your two dual boot OSes, I would argue that using ntfs as the partition format and mounting it with ntfs-3g on Ubuntu would be wiser.
2009-08-01T14:43:00.000Z	allquixotic	tbaxter	Not to mention ntfs is a journaling filesystem - vfat has many design flaws
2009-08-01T14:45:00.000Z	allquixotic	tbaxter	I have a question you may be able to answer if you want to stick with vfat, though. If you write some files to vfat on Ubuntu, reboot into Vista, don't see them, then reboot back to Ubuntu -- are the files still there?
2009-08-01T14:46:00.000Z	tbaxter	allquixotic	usually, yes. though I had one instance of them disappearing.
2009-08-01T14:47:00.000Z	allquixotic	tbaxter	Heh, that's even worse, then. "No" or "Yes" would have been more straightforward, but "usually" is even stranger :)
2009-08-01T14:48:00.000Z	tbaxter	allquixotic	that was kind of my issue. it's hard to use google-foo on a usually
2009-08-01T14:48:00.000Z	allquixotic	tbaxter	It sounds like Ubuntu's concept of vfat is different from Vista's. If you are actually writing the files and they (usually) persist across Ubuntu sessions, but don't show up in Vista, it may be that somehow Vista is mounting it as a different type of vfat than Ubuntu. c.f. the various vfat "sizes" and options
2009-08-01T14:50:00.000Z	tbaxter	allquixotic	thanks. I'll have a good look at it tomorrow. (and possibly just hang the vfat idea if ntfs support has improved.)
2009-08-01T14:50:00.000Z	allquixotic	tbaxter	At a minimum, I would suggest backing up _all_ the data you have on that partition as soon as possible. Then you might try reformatting it using mkfs.vfat and look at the options. But yes, ntfs support has improved drastically and I would recommend ntfs-3g due to the journaling options
2009-08-01T14:51:00.000Z	tbaxter	allquixotic	cheers. you've helped my sanity considerably.
2009-08-01T14:51:00.000Z	allquixotic	tbaxter	Personally, I just mount my Windows NTFS drives directly into Ubuntu using ntfs-3g. I have never had a corrupted 'doze filesystem because of ntfs-3g, and I used much more experimental versions of ntfs-3g years ago
2009-08-01T14:52:00.000Z	allquixotic	tbaxter	For absolute safety of your windows OS though, you might want to preserve your idea of an intermediary partition like you have now, and never mount your Windows OS system volume directly.
2009-08-01T14:52:00.000Z	allquixotic	tbaxter	Personally I keep all my music in my Windows user's home directory and symlink it into ~/Music on Ubuntu. Heh. Works perfectly.
