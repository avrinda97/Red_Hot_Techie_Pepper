2008-08-15T04:33:00.000Z	dlemcoe		What does "Secret key not availible" mean?
2008-08-15T04:33:00.000Z	weatherhead	dlemcoe	it means your secret key is not in your GPG keyring... if you've lost it completely, you're as we say in the geek world "hosed"
2008-08-15T04:35:00.000Z	weatherhead	dlemcoe	if you've lost your secret key, and all means to revoke your key, then you have absolutely no chance to recover data encrypted with it
2008-08-15T04:37:00.000Z	dlemcoe	weatherhead	What's the deal with my secret key, how can I maek a new one
2008-08-15T04:37:00.000Z	weatherhead	dlemcoe	do you know anything about public key encryption?
2008-08-15T04:38:00.000Z	weatherhead	dlemcoe	I suggest you look at it.
2008-08-15T04:39:00.000Z	weatherhead	dlemcoe	basically you need to generate a new key pair, delete the old one forget it ever existed... then export the secret key somewhere ... REALLY REALLY REALLY safe where noone can get at it
2008-08-15T04:39:00.000Z	weatherhead	dlemcoe	the beauty of the system is that you can give your public key to anyone and everyone, and they can encrypt stuff that you can only decrypt with your secret key
2008-08-15T04:41:00.000Z	dlemcoe	weatherhead	can you answer the questipn plz
2008-08-15T04:41:00.000Z	weatherhead	dlemcoe	to my shame I have never used gnuPG from the command line, only via GUI from KGPG
2008-08-15T04:42:00.000Z	weatherhead	dlemcoe	are you on GNOME?
2008-08-15T04:42:00.000Z	dlemcoe	weatherhead	yes
2008-08-15T04:42:00.000Z	weatherhead	dlemcoe	then I suggest using whatever gnome's equivalent is, instead of installing all the kde libraries etc. With this I can't help you, i have never really used GNOME
2008-08-15T04:43:00.000Z	weatherhead	dlemcoe	you could look for a tutorial on gnuPG though
2008-08-15T04:48:00.000Z	weatherhead	dlemcoe	sorry I didn't realise you were just signing it. It's probably not even gpg you need
2008-08-15T04:48:00.000Z	weatherhead	dlemcoe	I just saw private key and assumed you were encrypting stuff. What are you actually trying to do
2008-08-15T04:49:00.000Z	dlemcoe	weatherhead	signing the Ubuntu Code o' conduct
2008-08-15T04:50:00.000Z	weatherhead	dlemcoe	what is that?
