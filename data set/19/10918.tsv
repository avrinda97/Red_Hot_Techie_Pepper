2010-05-11T14:51:00.000Z	erUSUL	JediMaster	kvm ?
2010-05-11T14:53:00.000Z	JediMaster	erUSUL	kvm can run windows?
2010-06-07T14:49:00.000Z	erUSUL	JediMaster	tried « sudo /etc/init.d/mysql start » ?
2010-06-07T14:49:00.000Z	JediMaster	erUSUL	yes, hangs, no errors
2010-06-07T14:50:00.000Z	JediMaster	erUSUL	doesn't return to the command prompt
2010-06-07T14:50:00.000Z	erUSUL	JediMaster	nothing in logs either?
2010-06-07T14:50:00.000Z	JediMaster	erUSUL	actually that was for "start mysql" as /etc/init.d/mysql script tells me it's been converted to an upstart job
2010-06-07T14:51:00.000Z	erUSUL	JediMaster	"sudo start mysql" hangs too ?
2010-06-07T14:51:00.000Z	JediMaster	erUSUL	nothing in syslog
2010-06-07T14:51:00.000Z	JediMaster	erUSUL	sorry the init.d script doesn't hang, just returns the upstart message, start mysql hangs
