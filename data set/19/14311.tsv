2007-06-02T10:13:00.000Z	spikeb	silvernode	yeah. in fact, intel's onboard video stuff is among the best supported driver wise :)
2007-06-02T10:14:00.000Z	spikeb	silvernode	and the specs and drivers are open.
2007-06-02T10:15:00.000Z	spikeb	silvernode	hehe
2007-06-02T10:16:00.000Z	spikeb	silvernode	how does it work on that? :)
2007-06-02T10:17:00.000Z	spikeb	silvernode	consequence of having an ATI card rather than an older computer
2007-06-02T10:19:00.000Z	spikeb	silvernode	probably also the issue with WoW as well.
2007-06-02T10:19:00.000Z	spikeb	silvernode	ATI cards have issues with wine/cedega
2007-06-02T10:21:00.000Z	spikeb	silvernode	nvidia's drivers are managed by the restricted drivers manager now :)
2007-06-02T10:22:00.000Z	spikeb	silvernode	i dont like nvidia (the company) any more than you do, but they have far superior linux drivers
