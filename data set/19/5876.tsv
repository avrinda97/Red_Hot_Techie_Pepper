2008-06-02T21:54:00.000Z	cygoku		Isn't there an open source driver for the Broadcom Wireless for Hardy Heron that works ?!?!
2008-06-02T21:54:00.000Z	MrObvious	cygoku	I had to use ndiswrapper for my 94311.
2008-06-02T21:55:00.000Z	MrObvious	cygoku	B43 is a pile of crap right now unfourtinately. It barel y works.
2008-06-02T21:56:00.000Z	MrObvious	cygoku	Let me find you a better wiki link.
2008-06-02T21:57:00.000Z	MrObvious	cygoku	If I can find it. :\
2008-06-02T21:59:00.000Z	MrObvious	cygoku	Which exact chipset do you have?
2008-06-02T21:59:00.000Z	cygoku	MrObvious	seems like this wiki will be okay !
2008-06-02T21:59:00.000Z	MrObvious	cygoku	Make sure you use ndiswrapper. b43 is crap really. :\
2008-06-02T22:00:00.000Z	MrObvious	cygoku	FOUND IT! https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/bcm43xx/Feisty_No-Fluff
2008-06-02T22:00:00.000Z	MrObvious	cygoku	Seriously I used that and it worked great.
2008-06-02T22:01:00.000Z	MrObvious	cygoku	Just follow it step by step for your chipset. It's really easy.
2008-06-02T22:02:00.000Z	MrObvious	cygoku	Yes.
2008-06-02T22:02:00.000Z	MrObvious	cygoku	If you do a lspci | grep roadcom on a terminal it will tell you the chipset of your LAN and WLAN chips.
2008-06-02T22:04:00.000Z	MrObvious	cygoku	That's your LAN chipset. What's the other line?
2008-06-02T22:04:00.000Z	MrObvious	cygoku	Excellent you have the exact same chipset.
2008-06-02T22:05:00.000Z	MrObvious	cygoku	Now just follow the steps for the 94311 (I think it's 4311 rev. 2) on that link I gave you for the wiki.
2008-06-02T22:05:00.000Z	MrObvious	cygoku	Yup. I have 94311 Hardy 64 bit on my Dell Vostro 1700 using ndiswrapper.
2008-06-02T22:12:00.000Z	MrObvious	cygoku	Are you getting it to work?
2008-06-02T22:48:00.000Z	cygoku	MrObvious	my connection is currently so slow, that I cannot surf web to wiki's and or packages to download !
