2005-03-29T12:16:00.000Z	sic|		anyone know of a really good mixer that will kick ass for things like TeamSpeak?
2005-03-29T12:17:00.000Z	crimsun	sic|	please be more precise regarding "mixer"
2005-03-29T12:17:00.000Z	sic|	crimsun	sound card mixer...  ex. alsa, OSS
2005-03-29T12:18:00.000Z	sic|	crimsun	can't get TeamSpeak to work right...people can barely hear me
2005-03-29T12:18:00.000Z	crimsun	sic|	Are you referring to a gui mixer control, like the Volume Control or alsamixergui?
2005-03-29T12:19:00.000Z	sic|	crimsun	yes
2005-03-29T12:19:00.000Z	crimsun	sic|	and the ALSA mixer option in Volume Control isn't cutting it?
2005-03-29T12:19:00.000Z	sic|	crimsun	nope...people can barely hear me and I have it turned all the way up
2005-03-29T12:30:00.000Z	crimsun	sic|	have you tried manually adjusting the necessary sliders in alsamixer (running in a Terminal)?
2005-03-29T12:56:00.000Z	crimsun	sic|	did you answer my earliest question?
2005-03-29T12:57:00.000Z	sic|	crimsun	I haven't tried it in a terminal
2005-03-29T12:57:00.000Z	sic|	crimsun	don't know how
2005-03-29T12:59:00.000Z	crimsun	sic|	use the left and right arrows to move between sliders; use 'm' to unmute; use the up and down arrows to adjust the slider levels; use the space bar to select; use F3/F4 to toggle between playback/capture views
2005-03-29T13:02:00.000Z	sic|	crimsun	problem is I don't know what command to invoke the command line mixer
2005-03-29T13:02:00.000Z	crimsun	sic|	,,alsamixer''
2005-03-29T13:07:00.000Z	sic|	crimsun	no different...and I need sleep...gnite and thanks for the help
