2006-09-24T10:49:00.000Z	ArrenLex		!paste
2006-09-24T10:51:00.000Z	ArrenLex		Then see if Nautilus will open it.
2006-09-24T10:52:00.000Z	ArrenLex		Scalken: that's very odd. There's nothing WRONG with a long name with a space. It should open.
2006-09-24T10:54:00.000Z	ArrenLex		SB: Does Windows work on this machine?
2006-09-24T10:54:00.000Z	ArrenLex		burner: for PDA?
2006-09-24T10:56:00.000Z	bur[n] er	ArrenLex	kinda... it's a phone, but it runs windows mobile
2006-09-24T10:57:00.000Z	bur[n] er	ArrenLex	mostly i want to put mp3s on its storage card via usb, but not sure how i would... i might try wine
2006-09-24T10:59:00.000Z	bur[n] er	ArrenLex	thanks for the feedback... i'll let you know how wine goes... vmware with windows xp and activesync works, but that's not a great solution ;)
2006-09-24T11:00:00.000Z	bur[n] er	ArrenLex	you tried?
2006-09-24T11:02:00.000Z	bur[n] er	ArrenLex	by microsd is behind the battery... lil bit of a pain :\
2006-09-24T11:03:00.000Z	bur[n] er	ArrenLex	i tried that... i use a "T-Mobile SDA" which is pretty unique
2006-09-24T11:04:00.000Z	bur[n] er	ArrenLex	no worries, i appreciate the banter about devices though ;)
2006-09-26T12:01:00.000Z	bur[n] er	ArrenLex	he says he uses gnome ;)
2006-09-26T12:01:00.000Z	bur[n] er	ArrenLex	might as well have the whole thing :)
2006-09-26T12:17:00.000Z	bur[n] er	ArrenLex	i see that :\  oh well
2006-09-26T12:40:00.000Z	bur[n] er	ArrenLex	i'm referring to the fact that if someone else decides to use linux, another person doesn't have to sacrifice
2006-09-26T12:40:00.000Z	bur[n] er	ArrenLex	code is easily copied and reproduced
2006-09-26T13:09:00.000Z	bur[n] er	ArrenLex	that i leave to them ;)
