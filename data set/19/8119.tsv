2011-10-24T21:16:00.000Z	MindSpark		hi. can someone tell me why my 11.10 system looks like a 90's installation of redhat?
2011-10-24T21:16:00.000Z	MindSpark		the theme looks very old all of a sudden
2011-10-24T21:17:00.000Z	dr_willis	MindSpark	 be a bit more specific. perhaps post a screen shot - and tell us the version # of ububntu you are using.
2011-10-24T21:18:00.000Z	MindSpark	dr_willis	I am using 11.10, had this computer as is for 2 years and been upgrading normally since v8. I don't know why I am having trouble dealing with unity and I just don't like it. I would rather be using gnome. But it seems like gnome 2 is just not cutting it with the recent changes
2011-10-24T21:19:00.000Z	dr_willis	MindSpark	 gnome -2 is dead....   If you want a old-skool type desktop these days. You may want to check out Lubuntu/Lxde
2011-10-24T21:20:00.000Z	MindSpark	dr_willis	I don't want an oldskool looking anything. In fact, I hate the currently looking system. It looks like I reverted back to a very old one. I am guessing my themes are not compatible with the 11.10 changes
2011-10-24T21:21:00.000Z	dr_willis	MindSpark	 gnome-3 uses totally differnt themeing then the old gnome. theres also gtk2 vs gtk3 issues.
2011-10-24T21:21:00.000Z	dr_willis	MindSpark	 there was a bug  that caused gnome2 to reset back to a window-95ish theme.. if thats what you are refering to.
2011-10-24T21:22:00.000Z	MindSpark	dr_willis	I think I might have some gnome2 apps along with other gnome3 apps. Gnome shell fails to launch properly, either I get a segfault or it just hangs without me being able to focus on any running window, which leaves my x system unstable
2011-10-24T21:22:00.000Z	MindSpark	dr_willis	sounds like that's it, how do I fix that?
2011-10-24T21:23:00.000Z	dr_willis	MindSpark	 no idea. ive never experienced it.. this is the forst ive heard it mentioned in 11.10 also.. it was a 11.04 bug.
2011-10-24T21:26:00.000Z	dr_willis	MindSpark	 gnome2 is basically removed..  everyone is fighting with  trying to get gnome3/gnome-shell to look/act like gnome2
2011-10-24T21:27:00.000Z	MindSpark	dr_willis	 not me. I am actually trying to get gnome3 to work
2011-10-24T21:27:00.000Z	dr_willis	MindSpark	 clean install here.. gnome-shell works fine. testing out themes for it now.
2011-10-24T21:28:00.000Z	dr_willis	MindSpark	 as a test.. try making a new user.. see if gnome-shell works for them. it could be your old user settings are causing the issues.

2011-10-24T21:28:00.000Z	MindSpark	dr_willis	negative, I deleted all config files and still having issues
2012-09-13T15:00:00.000Z	dr_willis	MindSpark	 does it say why its fscking. any messages like 'last fsck date set to future' or 'fsck count reashed'
2012-09-13T15:01:00.000Z	MindSpark	dr_willis	the netbooks cmos battery is not working properly anymore. So I have to set the time/date on each startup. It used to be a problem like you mentioned, that the last mount is in the future. Until I would just set the time every on every boot
