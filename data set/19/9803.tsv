2006-09-12T09:04:00.000Z	conner_	barmin	if you wait until October, Edgy should be released then.
2006-09-12T09:11:00.000Z	conner_	barmin	reboot, at grub, select one of the "maintenance" options. Then force a re-install of gnome.
2006-09-12T09:11:00.000Z	barmin	conner_	I removed them, for ease of use to my family...
2006-09-12T09:13:00.000Z	conner_	barmin	just because you removed the labels does not mean that you've removed the functionality.
2006-09-12T09:14:00.000Z	barmin	conner_	Of course... The thing is... I don't now how to get there, now, hahaha
2006-09-12T09:15:00.000Z	conner_	barmin	google is your friend. http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/grub-boot-into-single-user-mode/
2006-09-12T09:17:00.000Z	barmin	conner_	lol... thanks... Now... is there a one-command way to reinstall gnome?
2006-09-12T09:18:00.000Z	conner_	barmin	apt-get --reinstall install gdm
2006-09-12T09:19:00.000Z	barmin	conner_	thanks, really. But I'd like to keep it clean, rather than install it over... Is there a log, to figure out what's wrong?
2006-09-12T09:19:00.000Z	conner_	barmin	yes, there is.
2006-09-12T09:19:00.000Z	barmin	conner_	so... where? lol
2006-09-12T09:19:00.000Z	conner_	barmin	it's on your computer.
2006-09-12T09:20:00.000Z	barmin	conner_	Well... you're a genius, lol ... do you know which file keeps the log? If so, would you please tell me?
2006-09-12T09:22:00.000Z	conner_	barmin	don't worry about that. When you re-install Gnome, it will leave the log files so you can go back and see what the problem was.
2006-09-12T09:23:00.000Z	barmin	conner_	thanks a lot.
