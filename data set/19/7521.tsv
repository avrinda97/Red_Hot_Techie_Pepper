2007-09-16T11:52:00.000Z	lastexile		can anyone tell me anything about problems unmounting external units in ubuntu
2007-09-16T11:52:00.000Z	lastexile		?
2007-09-16T11:53:00.000Z	asc	lastexile	It would help if we knew what the problem was. I mean, did it catch on fire or what?
2007-09-16T11:54:00.000Z	lastexile	asc	the problem is that when I want to unmount it simply shows up a pop up saying that something has to be written
2007-09-16T11:55:00.000Z	asc	lastexile	Not an error I've seen before. Try dismounting it from the terminal?
2007-09-16T11:56:00.000Z	asc	lastexile	I'd try 'sudo unmount /dev/device' then. It might give you a more useful error.
2007-09-16T11:57:00.000Z	lastexile	asc	it says an app is using the hdd
2007-09-16T11:58:00.000Z	asc	lastexile	run 'sudo lsof /dev/device' and it should tell you which
2007-09-16T12:02:00.000Z	asc	lastexile	Um, interesting.
2007-09-16T12:04:00.000Z	asc	lastexile	One thing you could try it just pulling it out. If you didn't edit anything, there shouldn't be any problems. :p
2007-09-16T12:05:00.000Z	asc	lastexile	But that's not very good advise.
2007-09-16T12:05:00.000Z	lastexile	asc	Im sorry for my girlfriend but Im definitely coming back to debian 3...
2007-09-16T12:06:00.000Z	asc	lastexile	Debian is for the win.
2007-09-16T12:09:00.000Z	asc	lastexile	Well, I have to admit that I've not run into mtab.
2007-09-16T12:09:00.000Z	asc	lastexile	Righto. Live and be well.
