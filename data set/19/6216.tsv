2008-02-24T07:46:00.000Z	Shapeshifter		Does someone know about the ubuntu xvncviewer package - where there might be a source, how it is patched, and how I can get it to another distro? I'm especially talking about the "real" scrollbars and the nicer OSD. any idea?
2008-02-24T07:47:00.000Z	ka2	Shapeshifter	http://packages.ubuntu.com/gutsy/xvncviewer
2008-02-24T07:48:00.000Z	ka2	Shapeshifter	what do you need to get that package onto another disto for
2008-02-24T07:48:00.000Z	ka2	Shapeshifter	oh i see
2008-02-24T07:48:00.000Z	Shapeshifter	ka2	I want to use it in Archlinux, but it seems like xvncviewer only exists as a binary for ubuntu, while the source on that page simply is "vnc4"
2008-02-24T07:49:00.000Z	ka2	Shapeshifter	if you want the source code for the ubuntu package you will have to download the whole ubuntu vnc source
2008-02-24T07:50:00.000Z	Shapeshifter	ka2	I had a look at the files in that source and there's nothing about xvncviewer in there actually. Do I simply need to compile the whole thing and xvncviewer will be available then, or wont that work?
2008-02-24T07:50:00.000Z	ka2	Shapeshifter	i believe the whole thing yes
2008-02-24T07:51:00.000Z	Shapeshifter	ka2	I'll try that, thanks
2008-02-24T07:52:00.000Z	Shapeshifter	ka2	as I'm on it, I will use xtightvncviewer. I can't really tell if this is the most recent version: http://packages.ubuntu.com/edgy/x11/xtightvncviewer?lang=en but it should be I guess, right?
2008-02-24T07:54:00.000Z	ka2	Shapeshifter	this would http://packages.ubuntu.com/gutsy/x11/xtightvncviewer but it seems to be the sme version i will just check some more things though
2008-02-24T07:55:00.000Z	ka2	Shapeshifter	the ubuntu tightvncviewer seems to be outdated maybe try http://www.tightvnc.com/?
2008-02-24T07:56:00.000Z	Shapeshifter	ka2	k... But it's still irritating me that there's no word of xtightvncviewer in that package or xvncviewer in the vnc4 package. not in the readme, and there's no file like that... I wonder how I was able to just apt-get xvncviewer back then.
2008-02-24T07:57:00.000Z	ka2	Shapeshifter	odd. but that is the source package xvncviewer was built from
2008-02-24T07:57:00.000Z	ka2	Shapeshifter	as i said you could just try getting tightvnc
2008-02-24T07:57:00.000Z	ka2	Shapeshifter	or the GNOME terminal services client
2008-02-24T07:59:00.000Z	Shapeshifter	ka2	there's no xtightvncviewer on the tightvnc page eighter... that's what is confusing me the most... it's like there's no trace xvncviewer or xtightvncviewer "ever existed"
2008-02-24T07:59:00.000Z	ka2	Shapeshifter	its part of the tightvnc package
2008-02-24T08:00:00.000Z	Shapeshifter	ka2	could it be that it's simply vncviewer / tightvncviewer with certain options or a special patch? Yeah but there's no xvncviewer inside that package. at least I can't find something like that.
