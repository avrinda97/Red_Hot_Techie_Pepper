2009-04-30T23:14:00.000Z	BCampbell	daveosociologist	how is the printer connected to network? shared on a windows box or ip?
2009-04-30T23:14:00.000Z	daveosociologist		bcampbell: access point is through a windows machine but it has an IP
2009-04-30T23:15:00.000Z	BCampbell	daveosociologist	attached direct to the AP?  check that all ip settings, subnet etc are the same?
2009-04-30T23:15:00.000Z	daveosociologist		bcampbell: on the other windows machine it is listed as Cannon on COM19the name of our front computer)
2009-04-30T23:16:00.000Z	BCampbell	daveosociologist	if it's finding the printer as a shared device from windows make sure the host machine has a user and pass the same as the liinux user
2009-04-30T23:17:00.000Z	BCampbell	daveosociologist	if the printer has an IP you shoudl be able to install it direct and avoid the windows box entirely
2009-04-30T23:18:00.000Z	daveosociologist	BCampbell	yeah, ubuntu detected an IP and is using it
2009-04-30T23:19:00.000Z	BCampbell	daveosociologist	is the driver the latest from the manufacturer or included on cd?  make sure it's the proper for ubuntu and printer
2009-04-30T23:21:00.000Z	daveosociologist		bcampbell: ubuntu found the driver just yesterday. not sure where that auto search looks but i expect it is the latest driver. IP and Gateway are different on printer. Location is accurate in printer properties but device URI seems funny.
2009-04-30T23:22:00.000Z	daveosociologist		bcampbell: would it help to set the device URI to the gateway address?
2009-04-30T23:23:00.000Z	BCampbell	daveosociologist	you mean ubuntu finds the printer on a different ip than the windows box?  it needs to be the same.  can you open a status page in a browser if you use http://ip.of.printer?
2009-04-30T23:24:00.000Z	daveosociologist		bcampbell: IP in ubuntu is the same as on the printer. The Gateway on the printer is different from the IP. Gateway is the IP of the main office computer that all other machines route to printer through
2009-04-30T23:25:00.000Z	BCampbell	daveosociologist	does only printing route through that AP or does all traffic go thru it? i'm thinking the gateway needs to be the same everywhere
2009-04-30T23:27:00.000Z	daveosociologist		bcampbell: I am a little unsure on how exactly this network is organized. THe printer is installed on the front computer and print traffic goes through there butwe have a router and all other network traffic goes through there unless it is just file shares
2009-04-30T23:28:00.000Z	BCampbell	daveosociologist	so the printer IS connected to a windows box and NOT directly to the AP?  I'm confused please set me straight
2009-04-30T23:30:00.000Z	daveosociologist		bcampbell: that is the odd part. the printer is hooked up directly to the router but all the windows machines get to it through the front computer
2009-04-30T23:31:00.000Z	BCampbell	daveosociologist	then most likey, the front machine has it shared out to the workgroup.  But the ubuntu found it on the IP from the router.  I would think you will need to remove this install and reinstall it as a smb setup
2009-04-30T23:33:00.000Z	daveosociologist		bcampbell: thanks a bunch. i will try this and see how it comes out!
2009-04-30T23:33:00.000Z	BCampbell	daveosociologist	best of luck!
