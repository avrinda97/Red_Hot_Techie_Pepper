2008-07-02T21:32:00.000Z	rampageoberon		Hi, just wondering is there a way to control the shutdown/reboot options from gnome-panel so that only users allowed in the sudoers file can do this?
2008-07-02T21:33:00.000Z	ikonia	rampageoberon	that should be how it's setup all ready
2008-07-02T21:39:00.000Z	rampageoberon	ikonia	thanks for the reply, I thought thats how it was set but tried it and found it was not. and i don't have any shutdown-set command
2008-07-02T21:40:00.000Z	ikonia	rampageoberon	what username did you use to setup ubuntu at install time
2008-07-02T21:41:00.000Z	ikonia	rampageoberon	that new user - if you do "sudo apt-get update" does that allow it or not ?
2008-07-02T21:41:00.000Z	ikonia	rampageoberon	now that is very odd/unexpected
2008-07-02T21:42:00.000Z	ikonia	rampageoberon	you could remove x permissions from the world in /sbin/shutdown
2008-07-02T21:42:00.000Z	rampageoberon	ikonia	yeah, i thought so myself, it was different when i tried the same with v7.1
2008-07-02T21:42:00.000Z	ikonia	rampageoberon	that would stop it
2008-07-02T21:42:00.000Z	rampageoberon	ikonia	okay let me try that
2008-07-02T21:44:00.000Z	ikonia	rampageoberon	bug #54034 on launchpad
2008-07-02T21:45:00.000Z	ikonia	rampageoberon	sorry bug #47834
2008-07-02T21:45:00.000Z	rampageoberon	ikonia	thanks, i'll read through that
2008-07-02T21:50:00.000Z	rampageoberon	ikonia	Hmm, both those bugs were related to xfce, is there something for gnome?
2008-07-02T21:50:00.000Z	ikonia	rampageoberon	potentially - give me a minute or too, the principal of the bug is the same, if not the details
2008-07-02T21:51:00.000Z	rampageoberon	ikonia	okay, thanks again :)
