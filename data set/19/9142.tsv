2007-01-10T16:18:00.000Z	mwe	cmiuc007	you want 1 in the last field for / at least
2007-01-10T16:19:00.000Z	mwe	cmiuc007	not fscking the root partition is not a good idea
2007-01-10T16:21:00.000Z	mwe	cmiuc007	odd. the root partition should be fscked at regular intervals

2007-01-10T16:27:00.000Z	cmiuc007	mwe	adaptr: does the number increase as you add more partitions or more OS'es?

2007-01-10T16:30:00.000Z	mwe	cmiuc007	asuming you want a check. if you don't it should be 0
2007-01-10T16:30:00.000Z	cmiuc007	mwe	adaptr I dont see what the check does
2007-01-10T16:31:00.000Z	mwe	cmiuc007	it runs fsck at boot for the file system if a certaion time period or mount count is reached
