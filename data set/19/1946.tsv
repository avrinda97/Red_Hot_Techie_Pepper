2010-12-23T17:00:00.000Z	Syria	bennym	I have tried this, I have changed the hardware and configured it to use hdmi but it didn't work.
2010-12-23T17:00:00.000Z	Syria	bennym	After changing the hardware no it doesn't.
2010-12-23T17:01:00.000Z	bennym	Syria	What hardware did you change?
2010-12-23T17:01:00.000Z	Syria	bennym	hardware from the sound preferences.
2010-12-23T17:03:00.000Z	Syria	bennym	Sound preferences > hardware > hdmi output
2010-12-23T17:03:00.000Z	bennym	Syria	Does the LCD monitor support HDMI audio?
2010-12-23T17:03:00.000Z	Syria	bennym	I used to connect it to my laptop on windows 7.
2010-12-23T17:03:00.000Z	Syria	bennym	Yes.
2010-12-23T17:06:00.000Z	bennym	Syria	Sounds like it should be working :/ Double check everything, check the volume on everything. If the application has any sound device settings, check them too.
2010-12-23T17:07:00.000Z	Syria	bennym	Thnx, i'll do that.
2010-12-23T17:12:00.000Z	Syria	bennym	I don't get the boarders when I am connecting my laptop to the lcd screen as well, do you know why please?
2010-12-23T17:14:00.000Z	bennym	Syria	Do you mean that the edges of the screen are off-screen?
2010-12-23T17:15:00.000Z	Syria	bennym	Gnome panels and rest of the boarders appear on the laptop only but doesnt appear on the lcd screen I have choosen "clone" I am using meerkat.
2010-12-23T17:16:00.000Z	bennym	Syria	Lower the screen resolution. Does that fix it?
2010-12-23T17:16:00.000Z	Syria	bennym	No one of these options helped! even auto.
2010-12-23T17:19:00.000Z	bennym	Syria	Does the LCD have buttons on it? You might have to use the LCD's menu to reconfigure it's width and height
2010-12-23T17:19:00.000Z	Syria	bennym	Have you tried connecting your computer to the lcd using hdmi cable on meerkat?
