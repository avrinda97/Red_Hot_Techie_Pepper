2007-01-05T08:34:00.000Z	bruenig		it is linux, if you want to develop something do it. Don't complain that the developers who do so for free are spending it on things you don't want them to
2007-01-05T08:35:00.000Z	gop	bruenig	 but that same is argued with microsoft products
2007-01-05T08:35:00.000Z	bruenig	gop	that is closed source, you can't do anything about that. You can for linux
2007-01-05T08:35:00.000Z	gop	bruenig	 hmm
2007-01-05T08:36:00.000Z	bruenig	gop	I am saying that people are developing for free what they want, don't complain about that. If you want something else developed you do it, don't tell these people who don't get paid by you to switch their focuses.
2007-01-05T08:37:00.000Z	gop	bruenig	 good point
2007-01-05T08:37:00.000Z	gop	bruenig	 but with closed source you software your paying some to code
2007-01-05T08:37:00.000Z	bruenig	gop	then complain and leave, but Ice_Wewe is crying about beryl developers and so was some other guy
2007-01-05T08:38:00.000Z	gop	bruenig	 I don't complain
2007-01-05T08:38:00.000Z	bruenig	gop	you are totally confused as to what the argument is
2007-01-05T08:38:00.000Z	bruenig	gop	there was no microsoft vs. linux argument. There was a "should you complain about linux developers and what they chose to develop or not" argument
2007-01-05T08:39:00.000Z	gop	bruenig	 oh
2007-01-05T08:41:00.000Z	bruenig	gop	it was over beryl, which is a fancy eye candy thing and they were complaining that developers shouldn't waste their time on it.
2007-01-05T08:41:00.000Z	bruenig	gop	not over ubuntu and the ubuntu developers over the beryl developers as if they should for whatever reason they should abandon their project and do something else
2007-01-05T08:41:00.000Z	gop	bruenig	 oh I see oh that just plain stupid
2007-01-05T08:42:00.000Z	gop	bruenig	 your right
2007-01-05T08:42:00.000Z	gop	bruenig	 I was confused
2007-02-25T11:40:00.000Z	gop	bruenig	 thanks
