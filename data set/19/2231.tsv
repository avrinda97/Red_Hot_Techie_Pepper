2010-11-01T02:12:00.000Z	wage		trying to update a package I get "Depends: python-gnome2-desktop but it is not installable" any ideas?
2010-11-01T02:12:00.000Z	guntbert	wage	did you update the database before?
2010-11-01T02:13:00.000Z	wage	guntbert	sudo apt-get update? yeah
2010-11-01T02:16:00.000Z	guntbert	wage	ok, please !pastebin the complete output of sudo apt-get upgrade
2010-11-01T02:20:00.000Z	wage	guntbert	http://pastebin.com/ta6yXfYr
2010-11-01T02:21:00.000Z	guntbert	wage	there is no error? where do get that error?
2010-11-01T02:21:00.000Z	wage	guntbert	When i'm trying to install panflute applet or upgrade it.
2010-11-01T02:24:00.000Z	guntbert	wage	on what ubuntu version? here it installs just fine (how did you try to "upgrade" it?)
2010-11-01T02:25:00.000Z	wage	guntbert	I'm  using 10.10. I had it installed, package manager came up saying it had an update and couldn't install. I uninstalled it, removed and readded the ppa, and tried again. no luck.
2010-11-01T02:26:00.000Z	guntbert	wage	did you enable any 3rd party repositories or ppa?
2010-11-01T02:27:00.000Z	guntbert	wage	you don't need a ppa, its in the repos
2010-11-01T02:27:00.000Z	wage	guntbert	I have a few 3rd party repos
2010-11-01T02:27:00.000Z	guntbert	wage	disable the one ppa you removed/readded
2010-11-01T02:29:00.000Z	wage	guntbert	that is not the latest version, its got a bunch of bugs that are now fixed in 0.7.0
2010-11-01T02:31:00.000Z	guntbert	wage	sorry, apparently that ppa brings in new dependencies without resolving them properly - with ppas you are mostly on your own...
2010-11-01T02:31:00.000Z	wage	guntbert	ok, i was hoping there'd be a simple way to install python-gnome2-desktop to fix it or something
2010-11-01T02:32:00.000Z	guntbert	wage	ask the author of that ppa where to get it - probably another ppa :-))
2010-11-01T02:32:00.000Z	wage	guntbert	ok thanks
2010-11-01T02:32:00.000Z	guntbert	wage	no problem :)
