2012-04-02T16:28:00.000Z	sddhrthrt		people : What is the use of  -dev packages? how do you use them?
2012-04-02T16:28:00.000Z	sddhrthrt		May sound like a silly question, but never really understood the use. Where will the source code be? how do you compile the obtained code?
2012-04-02T16:29:00.000Z	schnuffle	sddhrthrt	It contains all header files and so on to compile the package or packages that need to link against it
2012-04-02T16:29:00.000Z	schnuffle	sddhrthrt	you need the src code to compile the package, but its enough to install the dev package if another tool requires it
2012-04-02T16:32:00.000Z	sddhrthrt	schnuffle	okay.. now getting the idea. i was compiling bitblee from source because ubuntu 10.04 has a really very old bitlbee in its repository. is there a way of getting a new version other than compiling?
2012-04-02T16:32:00.000Z	schnuffle	sddhrthrt	 !ppa
2012-04-02T16:35:00.000Z	sddhrthrt	schnuffle	so, if i am right, i'll need dev of all the packages that are required for compilation?
2012-04-02T16:36:00.000Z	schnuffle	sddhrthrt	yes
2012-04-02T16:36:00.000Z	sddhrthrt	schnuffle	is there a way to automatically install -dev for all the dependencies of a program?
2012-04-02T16:37:00.000Z	schnuffle	sddhrthrt	 there's a way to get all dependencis if the source is a deb package
2012-04-02T16:42:00.000Z	schnuffle	sddhrthrt	because you haven't done an aptitude upgrade
2012-04-02T17:46:00.000Z	schnuffle	sddhrthrt	any logs?
2012-04-02T17:47:00.000Z	sddhrthrt	schnuffle	err.. one sec.
2012-04-02T17:47:00.000Z	sddhrthrt	schnuffle	any idea where to check?
