2010-06-26T05:36:00.000Z	baalwww		does ubuntu use the same file system as the host if it's running in virtualbox?
2010-06-26T05:36:00.000Z	Viking667	baalwww	it better NOT do. Thats' "not supported"
2010-06-26T05:36:00.000Z	baalwww	Viking667	what's better not do...running it in virtualbox?
2010-06-26T05:37:00.000Z	Viking667	baalwww	err, you don't use the host's filesystem as the root filesystem of the virtualbox instance.
2010-06-26T05:38:00.000Z	baalwww	Viking667	IConrad01: ok, well, I installed virtualbox on vista, and then ubuntu on virtualbox, which runs fine...except I can't do a sym link
2010-06-26T05:39:00.000Z	baalwww	Viking667	IConrad01: no, sym link within ubuntu. I installed phpmyadmin. it ended up in /usr/share and I need it sym linked to /var/www ... I get the message, despite sudo, that the action is not permitted
2010-06-26T05:40:00.000Z	Viking667	baalwww	hm. Sounds like you have other errors.
2010-06-26T05:40:00.000Z	baalwww	Viking667	well, i was reading a lot of messages about sym links not working in a fat32 partition... and i could think of no reason why linux would be on a fat32 partition other than a situation like mine
2010-06-26T05:43:00.000Z	Viking667	baalwww	seems strang.
2010-06-26T05:43:00.000Z	baalwww	Viking667	yup
2010-06-26T05:44:00.000Z	baalwww	Viking667	not permitted
2010-06-26T05:45:00.000Z	Viking667	baalwww	right. What does "mount" show?
2010-06-26T05:46:00.000Z	baalwww	Viking667	ext4
2010-06-26T05:46:00.000Z	Viking667	baalwww	right. WHat shows for /var (if anything)
2010-06-26T05:47:00.000Z	baalwww	Viking667	it's got /var/run and /var/lock, both none on tmpfs
2010-06-26T05:48:00.000Z	Viking667	baalwww	try this:   sudo touch /var/www/hello
2010-06-26T05:49:00.000Z	baalwww	Viking667	it accepted the command, but no output from it
2010-06-26T05:50:00.000Z	baalwww	Viking667	I have a directory from Vista mounted to /var/www ... would that matter?
2010-06-26T05:57:00.000Z	baalwww	Viking667	IConrad01: that was it. I unmounted the vista directory, restarted ubuntu, and the symlink worked
