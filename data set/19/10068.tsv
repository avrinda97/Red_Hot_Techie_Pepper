2006-08-01T06:24:00.000Z	Jerr|sd		ok, so my windows partition is under an extended partition
2006-08-01T06:26:00.000Z	Jerr|sd		uhh
2006-08-01T06:27:00.000Z	Jerr|sd		do you see your ubuntu installed system mounted?
2006-08-01T06:27:00.000Z	Jerr|sd		yeah
2006-08-01T06:27:00.000Z	Jerr|sd		but I might have to go in the same situation if I can't get my problem fixed
2006-08-01T06:29:00.000Z	Jerr|sd		I'm actually trying to get window's boot back
2006-08-01T06:29:00.000Z	Jerr|sd		yes
2006-08-01T06:29:00.000Z	Jerr|sd		I have it
2006-08-01T06:29:00.000Z	Jerr|sd		but since the installer didn't see one, it doesn't bother
2006-08-01T06:31:00.000Z	Jerr|sd		I'm in linux trying to get stupid Windows's boot thing to work
2006-08-01T06:31:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Jerr|sd	http://adrian15.raulete.net/grub/tiki-file_galleries.php  Super Grub Repair
2006-08-01T06:32:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Jerr|sd	But you cant get into windows right
2006-08-01T06:33:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Jerr|sd	you and bayzider are in similar situation
2006-08-01T06:33:00.000Z	Jerr|sd	Jack_Sparrow	similar, but opposite
2006-08-01T06:34:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Jerr|sd	http://adrian15.raulete.net/grub/tiki-file_galleries.php  Super Grub Repair just might make your XP bootable
2006-08-01T06:35:00.000Z	Jerr|sd	Jack_Sparrow	I don't see how, when the problem is not with grub but with windows loader
2006-08-01T06:36:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Jerr|sd	There are not many solutions to your problem, Windows dosent like being second fiddle
2006-08-01T06:36:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Jerr|sd	Maybe you should ask in #Windows
2006-08-01T06:37:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Jerr|sd	No
