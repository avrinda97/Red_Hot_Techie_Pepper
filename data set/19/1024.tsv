2011-06-08T20:02:00.000Z	sabayonweb_56278		Hi, I have a clean install of 11.04 amd64. After install I ran 'sudo get update and upgrade'. I now get a 'mountall Disconnect from Plymouth' error at boot and no window manager, please help.
2011-06-08T20:03:00.000Z	tucemiux	sabayonweb_56278	sounds like an ugly error, can you get into failsafe mode ?
2011-06-08T20:04:00.000Z	sabayonweb_56278	tucemiux	at boot?
2011-06-08T20:05:00.000Z	tucemiux	sabayonweb_56278	yes, when your machine boots up, does it go to a point where you see a menu and can pick failsafe mode?
2011-06-08T20:05:00.000Z	sabayonweb_56278	tucemiux	- no it just boots automatically - I don't get into menus. I can get into the command line if that'll help.
2011-06-08T20:06:00.000Z	tucemiux	sabayonweb_56278	if you can get into the command line then see if you have online access and try upgrading from there
2011-06-08T20:07:00.000Z	sabayonweb_56278	tucemiux	- I am indeed online - it's just that I don't have any window managers - and I have no idea what plymouth is
2011-06-08T20:08:00.000Z	tucemiux	sabayonweb_56278	 try upgrading first, get all the updates, reboot, then you figure out how to get a GUI
2011-06-08T20:09:00.000Z	sabayonweb_56278	tucemiux	- ok, let me see - polah - so update and upgrade, right? no specific packages?
2011-06-08T20:09:00.000Z	sabayonweb_56278	tucemiux	- it's holding back 4 packages
2011-06-08T20:10:00.000Z	tucemiux	sabayonweb_56278	just update and upgrade first, something obviously broke your distro, so just update and upgrade, then fix whatever's not working, it happened to me before
2011-06-08T20:11:00.000Z	tucemiux	sabayonweb_56278	it's hold back 4 packages? what's the error youre seeing, all in one line pleae
2011-06-08T20:13:00.000Z	sabayonweb_56278	tucemiux	the Plymouth error is gone now last line on reboot now :"saned disabled: edit /etc/default/saned'
2011-06-08T20:14:00.000Z	tucemiux	sabayonweb_56278	 you mean you still dont get a GUI?  It gets stuck booting up and all the last line you see if "edit /etc/default/saned"??
2011-06-08T20:14:00.000Z	sabayonweb_56278	tucemiux	on logging in on command line and trying gdm restart as root :"Warning: failed to acquire org.gnome.DisplayManager'
2011-06-08T20:14:00.000Z	sabayonweb_56278	tucemiux	yes, still no gui
2011-06-08T20:16:00.000Z	tucemiux	sabayonweb_56278	can you get into a command prompt? if you can then fix your GUI, there's plenty of howtos in the web
2011-06-08T20:18:00.000Z	tucemiux	sabayonweb_56278	if youre still having problems, come back to the channel and ask away, if someone has an answer theyll help you
2011-06-08T20:20:00.000Z	tucemiux	sabayonweb_56278	it's easy
