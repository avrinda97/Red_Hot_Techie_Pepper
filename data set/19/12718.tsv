2005-07-22T06:51:00.000Z	benkong2		hello everyone I am having major troubles with setting up a printer and cups has a message administrative tasks disabled. what can I do?
2005-07-22T06:52:00.000Z	gyaresu	benkong2	is your printer supported?
2005-07-22T06:53:00.000Z	benkong2	gyaresu	yes it needs hpljet3 driver
2005-07-22T06:53:00.000Z	gyaresu	benkong2	i don't know that driver but have you installed it?
2005-07-22T06:54:00.000Z	benkong2	gyaresu	my assumption was that since printers > administration gave me the option it was installed
2005-07-22T06:55:00.000Z	benkong2	gyaresu	If I could enable cups at localhost:631 I could fix it using cups and gimp-print
2005-07-22T06:56:00.000Z	gyaresu	benkong2	cups problems too?
2005-07-22T06:57:00.000Z	benkong2	gyaresu	when i browse to localhost:631 cups administration page is there i did grep and the cupsd dameon is running however in the cups admin page there is a small red banner directing me to use the  system-> printer menu choices because administration privilidges have been turned off.
2005-07-22T06:58:00.000Z	gyaresu	benkong2	have you enabled a root user?
2005-07-22T07:00:00.000Z	benkong2	gyaresu	yes root user enabled
2005-07-22T07:02:00.000Z	gyaresu	benkong2	I'm not really helping here....
2005-07-22T07:03:00.000Z	benkong2	gyaresu	np i am checking cupsd.conf to look for settings thanks
2005-07-22T07:09:00.000Z	benkong2	gyaresu	k
2005-07-22T07:12:00.000Z	benkong2	gyaresu	sJaM ; thanks got it fixed one must use the correct port and ubuntu rocks works like a dream using the menu. This distro is sooooo cool
2005-07-22T07:12:00.000Z	benkong2	gyaresu	sJaM ; thanks for your suggestions guided me to the solution
2005-07-22T07:12:00.000Z	gyaresu	benkong2	correct port?
2005-07-22T07:13:00.000Z	benkong2	gyaresu	actually 9100 is the port I have my jetdirect printer driver at 192.168.1.60 not 192.168.1.80 as I had put in the dialog did a ping and remembered the correct address.
2005-07-22T07:14:00.000Z	gyaresu	benkong2	nice. congrats.
2005-07-22T07:14:00.000Z	benkong2	gyaresu	thanks
