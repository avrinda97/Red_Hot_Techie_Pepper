2011-07-04T05:31:00.000Z	xrdodrx		hi, I'm having a rather unusual problem, my power just went out then came back on and now ubuntu won't access my external HDD. It is on and is spinning, but it will not mount. I have tried disconnecting and reconnecting the USB cable, but to no avail :(
2011-07-04T05:32:00.000Z	spacebug-	xrdodrx	is it a drive with external power to it, or does it get power through the usb cable?
2011-07-04T05:32:00.000Z	xrdodrx	spacebug-	external power
2011-07-04T05:32:00.000Z	spacebug-	xrdodrx	then it _might_ have gotten destroyd
2011-07-04T05:33:00.000Z	xrdodrx	spacebug-	don't say that :)
2011-07-04T05:33:00.000Z	xrdodrx	spacebug-	anything I can do to revive it?
2011-07-04T05:34:00.000Z	xrdodrx	spacebug-	right, but is there anything I can do to make it mount/revive it
2011-07-04T05:34:00.000Z	spacebug-	xrdodrx	tried it in another computer? put both the power and data cabel out for a minute? rebooted the laptop?
2011-07-04T05:34:00.000Z	xrdodrx	spacebug-	I'll try all three
2011-07-04T05:34:00.000Z	spacebug-	xrdodrx	ok
2011-07-04T05:38:00.000Z	spacebug-	xrdodrx	 the "medium error" seems no good :(
2011-07-04T05:39:00.000Z	xrdodrx	spacebug-	so it's toast then?
2011-07-04T05:41:00.000Z	xrdodrx	spacebug-	I'm not sure about the command :(
2011-07-04T05:43:00.000Z	spacebug-	xrdodrx	can't remember really what is should say but not just pause and no text
2011-07-04T05:44:00.000Z	xrdodrx	spacebug-	that's what it did...just paused
2011-07-04T05:44:00.000Z	spacebug-	xrdodrx	probably because it cannot access the device
2011-07-04T05:44:00.000Z	xrdodrx	spacebug-	the funny thing is that the access light is blinking
2011-07-04T05:46:00.000Z	xrdodrx	spacebug-	should I kill it?
2011-07-04T05:46:00.000Z	spacebug-	xrdodrx	hum maybe
