2007-12-13T10:25:00.000Z	arooni-mobile		what is the acceptable temp range (in celcius) for an intel core 2 duo cpu?
2007-12-13T10:25:00.000Z	loke	arooni-mobile	Which one?
2007-12-13T10:25:00.000Z	arooni-mobile	loke	does it differ between core 2 duos?
2007-12-13T10:26:00.000Z	arooni-mobile	loke	i know it has more cache than the entry level one... i think 4mb
2007-12-13T10:26:00.000Z	loke	arooni-mobile	Do you know the speed?
2007-12-13T10:26:00.000Z	loke	arooni-mobile	cat /proc/cpuinfo
2007-12-13T10:26:00.000Z	arooni-mobile	loke	hang on
2007-12-13T10:27:00.000Z	loke	arooni-mobile	Actually try this: cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep model\ name
2007-12-13T10:27:00.000Z	arooni-mobile	loke	model name      : Intel(R) Core(TM)2 CPU          6420  @ 2.13GHz
2007-12-13T10:28:00.000Z	loke	arooni-mobile	If your load temps are under 60 (preferably around 50) you're ok.
2007-12-13T10:28:00.000Z	arooni-mobile	loke	my cpu is currently at 68 or 69* C ... what does that mean?  should i get a better fan
2007-12-13T10:29:00.000Z	loke	arooni-mobile	Did you build this yourself?  Are you sure those temps are correct?
2007-12-13T10:29:00.000Z	arooni-mobile	loke	my comp does random restarts sometimes.......... yes i built it myself. ... i got the temp from the bios (asus mobo)
2007-12-13T10:30:00.000Z	loke	arooni-mobile	Re-apply the thermal paste.
2007-12-13T10:30:00.000Z	arooni-mobile	loke	u dont think i need a new fan?  its a intel cpu fan that came with processor..............   however the fan is getting kinda hard to put back onto the cpu securelty
2007-12-13T10:31:00.000Z	loke	arooni-mobile	That's a possibility.  You need perfect contact between the CPU and heatsink.
2007-12-13T10:32:00.000Z	arooni-mobile	loke	hmmmmmmmmm so u think a new fan is the way to go?  also, am i in any danger of running at 68 or 69*C?  wont it auto shut off if its too hot
2007-12-13T10:32:00.000Z	loke	arooni-mobile	If it's auto rebooting, then you have a problem.
2007-12-13T10:33:00.000Z	arooni-mobile	loke	is there anyway of knowing temp from within ubuntu
