2006-07-07T16:25:00.000Z	apikoros	yaniv_abir	are you fruitful or knightly?
2006-07-07T16:26:00.000Z	yaniv_abir	apikoros	are you suggesting anything? am I missing something?
2006-07-07T16:28:00.000Z	yaniv_abir	apikoros	do I know you?
2006-07-07T16:29:00.000Z	apikoros	yaniv_abir	no, just punning on your name, never mind
2006-07-07T16:30:00.000Z	apikoros	yaniv_abir	what's yr windows network? file/printer sharing or just shared internet?
2006-07-07T16:35:00.000Z	yaniv_abir	apikoros	my network is file/printer sharing
2006-07-07T16:35:00.000Z	apikoros	yaniv_abir	did you install samba?
2006-07-07T16:36:00.000Z	yaniv_abir	apikoros	and anyway, it worked out of the box, until it just disappeared one day
2006-07-07T16:37:00.000Z	yaniv_abir	apikoros	maybe I should try to uninstall samba? (I think) it was only installed when I tried to setup a shared folder within ubuntu
2006-07-07T16:41:00.000Z	yaniv_abir	apikoros	where are you from?
2006-07-07T16:42:00.000Z	yaniv_abir	apikoros	oh. and I thought you might be from my neighborhood...
2006-07-07T16:46:00.000Z	apikoros	yaniv_abir	do what i said, then, assuming the package name is actually samba
2006-07-07T16:47:00.000Z	yaniv_abir	apikoros	sababa, I'll try it
2006-07-07T16:47:00.000Z	apikoros	yaniv_abir	wait one sec
2006-07-07T16:48:00.000Z	yaniv_abir	apikoros	do I need to reboot?
2006-07-07T16:48:00.000Z	apikoros	yaniv_abir	no, this isn't windows :P
2006-07-07T16:49:00.000Z	apikoros	yaniv_abir	but you might have to do something like sudo /etc/init.d/smbd restart
2006-07-07T16:49:00.000Z	yaniv_abir	apikoros	well, years of using it have made it a reflex to reboot...
