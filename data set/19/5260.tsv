2008-08-02T20:22:00.000Z	raz0r949494		i have set up a wireless network using wep. when i connect to my AP everything seems fine, except i dont seem to have internet?
2008-08-02T20:22:00.000Z	raz0r949494		anyone help me?
2008-08-02T20:24:00.000Z	kindofabuzz	raz0r949494	good luck with that, i gave up on trying to get wep/wap working
2008-08-02T20:25:00.000Z	raz0r949494	kindofabuzz	so no encryption??
2008-08-02T20:25:00.000Z	kindofabuzz	raz0r949494	no, i just go with mac filtr
2008-08-02T20:26:00.000Z	raz0r949494	kindofabuzz	ok that sounds helpful, this would provide adequate security?
2008-08-02T20:29:00.000Z	kindofabuzz	raz0r949494	no, mac filter is not very good security since it can be cracked pretty quick.  but i'm not worried about it where i live
2008-08-02T20:29:00.000Z	raz0r949494	kindofabuzz	great, so there is no hope for a properly secure wireless netowrk in linux??
2008-08-02T20:30:00.000Z	kindofabuzz	raz0r949494	yeah it's possible, i just can't figure it out.  NM is so weird.  i set all my stuff in /etc/network/interfaces, then network manager just erases it
2008-08-02T20:33:00.000Z	raz0r949494	kindofabuzz	yeah thats what ive found
2008-08-02T20:33:00.000Z	raz0r949494	kindofabuzz	is there some way to remove nm??
2008-08-02T20:35:00.000Z	kindofabuzz	raz0r949494	yeah, you can remove anything you want, remove network-manager and network-manager-gnome and install wicd, see if you have better results than i did
2008-08-02T20:37:00.000Z	raz0r949494	kindofabuzz	ill try it
2008-08-02T20:38:00.000Z	raz0r949494	kindofabuzz	it seems to connect but hwen i open firefox i cant load any pages
2008-08-02T20:38:00.000Z	raz0r949494	kindofabuzz	almost seems like a dns problem
2008-08-02T20:38:00.000Z	kindofabuzz	raz0r949494	can you ping an ip?
2008-08-02T20:38:00.000Z	raz0r949494	kindofabuzz	shall i ping my router
2008-08-02T20:39:00.000Z	kindofabuzz	raz0r949494	ping an ip, then ping an address, if you can ping an ip but not an address then yeah it's a dns problem
2008-08-02T20:41:00.000Z	raz0r949494	kindofabuzz	ok thankyou
