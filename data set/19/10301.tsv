2006-06-29T16:22:00.000Z	passwordddd	soundray	: how
2006-06-29T16:23:00.000Z	soundray	passwordddd	has it loaded a driver for your sound automatically? Check with 'lsmod | grep snd'
2006-06-29T16:26:00.000Z	passwordddd	soundray	can i pm you the result?
2006-06-29T16:26:00.000Z	soundray	passwordddd	go ahead
2006-06-29T16:28:00.000Z	soundray	passwordddd	I'm not getting a pm. Perhaps post your output on http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org
2006-06-29T16:30:00.000Z	soundray	passwordddd	don't do that
