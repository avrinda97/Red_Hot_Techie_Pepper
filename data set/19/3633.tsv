2010-04-24T00:11:00.000Z	haavaros		Hi! I'm using Ubuntu 9.10. Often when I have many windows open, I can't switch to them via the panel, only by alt-tab. They don't respond on mouse clicks. What's wrong?
2010-04-24T00:12:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	haavaros	Compiz running?
2010-04-24T00:13:00.000Z	haavaros	LinuxGuy2009	Don't think so, I've disabled all visual effects under appearance
2010-04-24T00:14:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	haavaros	Have you checked launchpad to see if anyone else is having that issue?
2010-04-24T00:16:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	haavaros	thats strange
2010-04-24T00:16:00.000Z	haavaros	LinuxGuy2009	My thought exactly
2010-04-24T00:16:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	haavaros	Does it happen when some specific app is started?
2010-04-24T00:17:00.000Z	haavaros	LinuxGuy2009	Oh well ... there's some other peculiarities that have occured lately, so I'll just do a fresh install when 10 comes
2010-04-24T00:17:00.000Z	haavaros	LinuxGuy2009	Not that I have noticed
2010-04-24T00:17:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	haavaros	Other random probs?
2010-04-24T00:17:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	haavaros	Tested memory lately?
2010-04-24T00:17:00.000Z	haavaros	LinuxGuy2009	Yeah, like the indicator applet suddenly losing the option to shutdown etc
2010-04-24T00:18:00.000Z	haavaros	LinuxGuy2009	No, but that indicator problem is not unique, seen others get it too with 9.10
2010-04-24T00:18:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	haavaros	Oh ok
2010-04-24T00:18:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	haavaros	I completely skipped 9.10 cause of all the bugs I had with several machines. Dont feel bad.
2010-04-24T00:18:00.000Z	haavaros	LinuxGuy2009	Ok, good to know
2010-05-01T22:29:00.000Z	haavaros	LinuxGuy2009	I use gnome-terminal. It has none of the requested functions.
2010-05-01T22:30:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	haavaros	Right have you browsed through software center and tried a few others?
2010-05-01T22:31:00.000Z	haavaros	LinuxGuy2009	I've tried three, and googled around, but googling for "terminal linux sound charset" etc isn't specific enough
