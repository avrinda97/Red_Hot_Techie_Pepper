2005-11-22T07:46:00.000Z	Robbster		lo all. I'm tring to se my ethernet ADSL router to connect to two separate service providers at the same time. Can I do this?
2005-11-22T07:46:00.000Z	pharm	Robbster	No.
2005-11-22T07:47:00.000Z	pharm	Robbster	not at the same time over the same phone line.
2005-11-22T07:53:00.000Z	pharm	Robbster	ADSL sets up an ATM connection to your ADSL providers network over the phone line. Your phone exchange routes all the ATM packets it gets from the ADSL connection to a single provider. Unless your local exchange has extra-whizzy ADSL bits that can route packets to two separate providers then you can't do what you're asking. (Unless you have two phone lines & two ADSL modems...)
2005-11-22T07:53:00.000Z	pharm	Robbster	to put it another way -- you can do it if your phone provider provides you with a way to do it. Don't hold your breath...
2005-11-22T07:56:00.000Z	pharm	Robbster	that's different. The VPN is probably tunnelled over IP.
2005-11-22T07:57:00.000Z	pharm	Robbster	although it could be directly tunnelled over the ATM connection with the right networking hardware at both ends
2005-11-22T07:57:00.000Z	pharm	Robbster	You are confusing the internet connection and the VPN connection. These are not the same things.
2005-11-22T07:57:00.000Z	Robbster	pharm	is .za I doubt that we have the 'right networking hardware' at all :)
2005-11-22T07:58:00.000Z	Robbster	pharm	okay. as I understand it the VPN is just a separate IP network that is private.
2005-11-22T07:58:00.000Z	pharm	Robbster	probably.
2005-11-22T07:58:00.000Z	Robbster	pharm	so I authenticate to the VPN, and I'm connected to this quiet, private network.
2005-11-22T07:59:00.000Z	pharm	Robbster	it might well look like a separate ppp connection with some setups, where the ppp is a point-to-point encrypted link over another IP network.
2005-11-22T07:59:00.000Z	Robbster	pharm	ouch. lemme try digest that. Got any digestives? <grin>
2005-11-22T08:00:00.000Z	pharm	Robbster	:)
2005-11-22T08:00:00.000Z	pharm	Robbster	google vpn ppp brings up http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/ppp-ssh/
2005-11-22T08:00:00.000Z	Robbster	pharm	I think we are going down the wrong path, and that is my fault.
2005-11-22T08:02:00.000Z	pharm	Robbster	the VPN is usually secured via some sort of password or public key encryption set up. Otherwise it can be read on the public net you're passing it over...
2005-11-22T08:03:00.000Z	pharm	Robbster	That's perfectly doable, so long as the routes are setup correctly.
