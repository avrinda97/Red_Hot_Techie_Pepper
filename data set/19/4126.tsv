2009-05-26T10:40:00.000Z	stevecam		are NVIDIA drivers updated through the the ubuntu system update, or should i install the updates myself?
2009-05-26T10:40:00.000Z	zeltak2	stevecam	they are updated once in a while through sys update
2009-05-26T10:42:00.000Z	stevecam	zeltak2	ok, so how do i run this system update utility
2009-05-26T10:43:00.000Z	zeltak2		sweet. did the trick
2009-05-26T10:43:00.000Z	zeltak2		very wierd...i wonder if it will survive a restart..will try it now..thx ed_debian
2009-05-26T10:44:00.000Z	zeltak2	stevecam	it will auto pop up with update and if you wantto run manually use this
2009-05-26T10:44:00.000Z	zeltak2		sudo apt-get update
2009-05-26T10:45:00.000Z	stevecam		ahh, i ran that, i will presume that the driver update hasnt been rolled out yet
2009-05-26T10:45:00.000Z	zeltak2		yup
2009-05-26T10:45:00.000Z	stevecam		im talking about official nvidia drivers btw
2009-05-26T10:46:00.000Z	zeltak2		i preffer to wait for nvidia updates so i know its well tested :)
2009-05-26T10:46:00.000Z	zeltak2		i think its a bug ed_debian, after the restart the panel dissappears..ill file a bug..thx again
2009-05-26T10:46:00.000Z	stevecam		yeah, well i prefer to wait cas it ruins the point of using distros again
2009-05-26T10:46:00.000Z	stevecam		if i installed it by hand
2009-05-26T10:48:00.000Z	stevecam		other then the obvious reasons of being open source, is there any good reason i should use the open source graphics driver for my graphics card
2009-05-26T10:49:00.000Z	zeltak2		well thats the main reason :) if you want to get the best of the card unfortunanlty you have to use the closed source nvidia driver....lets hope some day thy will open their drivers..
2009-05-26T10:49:00.000Z	zeltak2		sweet..im game ed_debian, where should we start?
2009-05-26T10:51:00.000Z	zeltak2		lol..im a kde user on the desktop so hold on ill check :)
2009-05-26T10:52:00.000Z	stevecam	zeltak2	;-)
