2008-08-17T09:12:00.000Z	bobertdos		wow, exact same time, right down to the second :p
2008-08-17T09:13:00.000Z	bobertdos		What's up, anya?
2008-08-17T09:13:00.000Z	bobertdos		oh, right popups and windows..........umm.......Have you had this problem from the start, anya?
2008-08-17T09:14:00.000Z	anya	bobertdos	I I have problems with opening more than one window / pop-ups. It always freezes... and I have to force closing all windows.
2008-08-17T09:15:00.000Z	anya	bobertdos	no... it started aprox. 2 weeks ago.
2008-08-17T09:15:00.000Z	anya	bobertdos	this is my problem. I don't know. Unfortunately
2008-08-17T09:16:00.000Z	bobertdos	anya	Let's see, did you install any restricted drivers for your video card, enable compiz fusion, anything like that?
2008-08-17T09:17:00.000Z	anya	bobertdos	no I don't think so...
2008-08-17T09:18:00.000Z	bobertdos	anya	My first suggestion would be checking to see if Extra visual effects is enabled.
2008-08-17T09:19:00.000Z	anya	bobertdos	where can I see whether they are enabled???
2008-08-17T09:20:00.000Z	bobertdos	anya	System->Preferences->Appearance->Visual effects. I would suggest disabling them (selecting none), especially if they're set to extra.
2008-08-17T09:21:00.000Z	anya	bobertdos	they aren't set to extra.... (just normal)
2008-08-17T09:23:00.000Z	bobertdos	anya	Okay.......Well, I'm debating as to whether or not this could be an X problem. Are you on KDE or Gnome?
2008-08-17T09:24:00.000Z	anya	bobertdos	Gnome
2008-08-17T09:24:00.000Z	bobertdos	anya	hmm.....Well, just for the heck of it......
2008-08-17T09:26:00.000Z	bobertdos	anya	You might try setting desktop effects to none, just to see if it helps things........but I'm guessing this is either a video or an X problem. Maybe the system logs would have something useful to say. They can be found in /var/log
2008-08-17T09:29:00.000Z	anya	bobertdos	the none does not help. But however thank you very much for your help. I will keep trying on.
2008-08-17T09:29:00.000Z	bobertdos	anya	If I were you, I would search the logs for any unusual errors and things of that sort.
