2007-06-13T12:27:00.000Z	Shaddox		 Why are my blank DVD's coming up as a "CD-ROM" and not letting me burn them at all, instead of letting me burn them and regocnizing them as blank DVD's?

2007-06-13T12:29:00.000Z	nanotaboada	Shaddox	maybe the media isn't blank? maybe you'd try with other blank dvd
2007-06-13T12:29:00.000Z	Shaddox	nanotaboada	This is the fifth blank DVD i've tried. They can't ALL be bad...>_>
2007-06-13T12:30:00.000Z	nanotaboada	Shaddox	have you been able to write any dvd in the past?
2007-06-13T12:30:00.000Z	Shaddox	nanotaboada	Not that I know of, but regular CD's I can burn no problem.
2007-06-13T12:30:00.000Z	Shaddox	nanotaboada	Haven't tried burning a DVD yet, till today.
2007-06-13T12:31:00.000Z	nanotaboada	Shaddox	have you tried with an application? let's say brasero, gnome baker, so on?
2007-06-13T12:31:00.000Z	Shaddox	nanotaboada	GnomeBaker and KDE, in addition to normal Nautilus.
2007-06-13T12:32:00.000Z	nanotaboada	Shaddox	with KDE you mean K3B?
2007-06-13T12:32:00.000Z	Shaddox	nanotaboada	Yeah, my bad.
2007-06-13T12:34:00.000Z	nanotaboada	Shaddox	perhaps you should check System > Preferences > Hardware Information to see if that device is able to burn dvds
2007-06-13T12:36:00.000Z	Shaddox	nanotaboada	My hardware info shows that I can.
2007-06-13T12:38:00.000Z	Shaddox	nanotaboada	my hardware information says I can burn DVD's/
2007-06-13T12:39:00.000Z	nanotaboada	Shaddox	check this
2007-06-13T12:40:00.000Z	nanotaboada	Shaddox	System > Preferences > Removable Drives and Media
2007-06-13T12:41:00.000Z	Shaddox	nanotaboada	that has nothing to do with my problem.
2007-06-13T12:41:00.000Z	nanotaboada	Shaddox	in the Storage tab, verify that the "Burn a CD or DVD when a blank disc is inserted" option is checked
2007-06-13T12:41:00.000Z	nanotaboada	Shaddox	ok then i'm guess i couldn't help you, sorry
