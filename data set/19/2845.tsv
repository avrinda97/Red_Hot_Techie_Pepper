2010-02-16T01:14:00.000Z	Daughain	gwildor	Where are all the mixers?
2010-02-16T01:06:00.000Z	gwildor	Daughain	do you have  a cable  hooked up to the digital out fo your sound card?
2010-02-16T01:07:00.000Z	Daughain	gwildor	Ummm...Yes?
2010-02-16T01:07:00.000Z	gwildor	Daughain	you have  sets of speakers hooked up? 1 to analog, and one on digital ?
2010-02-16T01:07:00.000Z	gwildor	Daughain	2 sets *
2010-02-16T01:08:00.000Z	Daughain	gwildor	No, my output goes to my receiver. VLC manages to play sound, but nothing else does. I prolly could hook them both up, but I dont see any reason to
2010-02-16T01:09:00.000Z	gwildor	Daughain	on digital and analog out, vlc plays audio.... but only vlc does using digital out ?
2010-02-16T01:10:00.000Z	Daughain	gwildor	On analog, I have full sound with all apps. On digital, only VLC plays sound.
2010-02-16T01:10:00.000Z	gwildor	Daughain	that is odd......im gonna have to go with its a pulse error... double check yourmixers, be sure to unhide them all..... id also might try, settingit to digital, then restarting...just to see what happens.
2010-02-16T01:14:00.000Z	gwildor	Daughain	options or something..
2010-02-16T01:14:00.000Z	gwildor	Daughain	oh,wow....first time ive opened themixer on 9.10, its different then i remember...
2010-02-16T01:15:00.000Z	Daughain	gwildor	I'm in sound pref.s right now, trying to get it to configure digital.....
2010-02-16T01:15:00.000Z	gwildor	Daughain	set it to digital, open firefox with youtube, open sound prefs, and make sure firefox is turned up on the applications tab
2010-02-16T01:16:00.000Z	Daughain	gwildor	I dont get it, but it works fine now. Thanks a lot. =)

2010-02-16T01:17:00.000Z	Daughain	gwildor	I've done this a few times before, and it never worked, but hey..... =) Long as I got sound, right?
