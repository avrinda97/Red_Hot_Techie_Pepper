2006-10-01T14:31:00.000Z	CorpseFeeder		has anyone taken a look at this problem yet?  http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/25380/
2006-10-01T14:32:00.000Z	cherubiel	CorpseFeeder	give us the strace output also please
2006-10-01T14:33:00.000Z	CorpseFeeder	cherubiel	I'd love to give you the strace output, but unfortunately I don't know what that is or how to get it.
2006-10-01T14:34:00.000Z	cherubiel	CorpseFeeder	you understand that ou're using gcj right?
2006-10-01T14:34:00.000Z	cherubiel	CorpseFeeder	or are you not aware?
2006-10-01T14:35:00.000Z	CorpseFeeder	cherubiel	what do I put in <program>? What is gcj? the program I run from a terminal with "java -jar wordbiz.jar"
2006-10-01T14:35:00.000Z	cherubiel	CorpseFeeder	try this: ls -l `which java`
2006-10-01T14:36:00.000Z	cherubiel	CorpseFeeder	you must be using the gcc java wrapper..
2006-10-01T14:37:00.000Z	CorpseFeeder	cherubiel	"lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 22 2006-09-30 18:00 /usr/bin/java -> /etc/alternatives/java" did that mean anything important to you? Meant nothing to me...
2006-10-01T14:38:00.000Z	cherubiel	CorpseFeeder	try this swithc during compile, --enable-java-awt=gtk
2006-10-01T14:39:00.000Z	cherubiel	CorpseFeeder	your java is not from SUN, the one you are using is the java front end for gcc.
2006-10-01T14:41:00.000Z	cherubiel	CorpseFeeder	you need to update the links in /bin or /usr/bin
2006-10-01T14:42:00.000Z	cherubiel	CorpseFeeder	currently, the java you use is the gcc frontend..
2006-10-01T14:50:00.000Z	CorpseFeeder	cherubiel	I responded to the pm you sent me......
