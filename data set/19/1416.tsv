2011-11-08T14:03:00.000Z	Starminn	chroot	You can always revisit that page and turn it off later. Sometimes what you're experiencing is a result of Flash being sucky. What you're "opting in" is for a non-flash experience
2011-11-08T14:03:00.000Z	Starminn	chroot	I don't know
2011-11-08T14:07:00.000Z	Starminn	chroot	http://cloud.ubuntu.com/
