2005-10-02T08:45:00.000Z	darklogic		can anyone tell me why my new hoary install freezes on boot?
2005-10-02T08:45:00.000Z	darklogic		this is a bit frustrating
2005-10-02T08:45:00.000Z	mrimbert	darklogic	more details please.  That's obviously not what it does for the majority of people, or it would have been a big deal.
2005-10-02T08:46:00.000Z	mrimbert	darklogic	can you switch to a virtual console?
2005-10-02T08:47:00.000Z	darklogic	mrimbert	nope. completely frozen
2005-10-02T08:50:00.000Z	mrimbert	darklogic	totally frozen, eh?  Can you check /var/log/Xorg.0.log after booting into rescue mode?
2005-10-02T08:53:00.000Z	darklogic	mrimbert	nothing obvious in there, shall i send it to you?
2005-10-02T08:54:00.000Z	mrimbert	darklogic	you can paste it on pastebin if you want
2005-10-02T08:55:00.000Z	darklogic	mrimbert	http://pastebin.com/375308
2005-10-02T08:58:00.000Z	mrimbert	darklogic	you do have an Intel i8xx chipset?
2005-10-02T08:58:00.000Z	darklogic	mrimbert	yes onboard. but my monitor is plugged into my pci geforce4
2005-10-02T08:59:00.000Z	mrimbert	darklogic	ah, that's why.  Can you disable your i8xx in the BIOS?
2005-10-02T09:00:00.000Z	darklogic	mrimbert	not that i know of
2005-10-02T09:00:00.000Z	darklogic	mrimbert	my bios doesn't give me a whole lot of flexibility
2005-10-02T09:00:00.000Z	mrimbert	darklogic	well, xorg is currently configured to use it
2005-10-02T09:01:00.000Z	darklogic	mrimbert	figures. so should i switch my monitor to that vga port and change it to use the geforce then? and how?
2005-10-02T09:02:00.000Z	mrimbert	darklogic	if you want to use the geforce, you'll need to follow https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia, and see if that works.
2005-10-02T09:02:00.000Z	mrimbert	darklogic	you may have to be sure to specify the Bus ID, since you can't disable your i8xx
2005-10-02T09:04:00.000Z	darklogic	mrimbert	okay thanks for your help
