2008-08-08T07:26:00.000Z	gabmed		Where are the edgy repositories???
2008-08-08T07:27:00.000Z	Flannel	gabmed	Edgy has been EOL (unsupported) for some time now, as such, the repos are taken off line.  What are you trying to do?
2008-08-08T07:28:00.000Z	Flannel	gabmed	Yes, they're no longer active, you should upgrade to feisty (and beyond, since feisty will go away in a few months too)
2008-08-08T07:28:00.000Z	gabmed	Flannel	i'm trying to install nfts-3g, i have a problem with a ntfs partition
2008-08-08T07:29:00.000Z	Flannel	gabmed	I don't believe ntfs-3g was in Edgy anyway, you had to use a third party source for it.  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MountingWindowsPartitions/ThirdPartyNTFS3G
2008-08-08T07:30:00.000Z	Flannel	gabmed	but again, I must stress you ought to upgrade.  You've been without security updates for a few months now
2008-08-08T07:30:00.000Z	gabmed	Flannel	Can I use the dapper-drake repository to install ntfs-3g?
2008-08-08T07:31:00.000Z	Flannel	gabmed	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MountingWindowsPartitions/ThirdPartyNTFS3G?action=recall&rev=7
2008-08-08T07:31:00.000Z	Flannel	gabmed	edgy has been removed from the wiki as well, since it's not supported (but you can get it with versions)
2008-08-08T07:33:00.000Z	gabmed	Flannel	I'll try that, thank you so much!
2008-08-08T07:33:00.000Z	Flannel	gabmed	one last time, you should think about upgrading :)
2008-08-08T07:35:00.000Z	gabmed	Flannel	I'll do that!
2008-08-08T07:36:00.000Z	gabmed	Flannel	Do I have to upgrade one by one or is there a way to go to 8.04?
2008-08-08T07:36:00.000Z	Flannel	gabmed	From edgy you have to upgrade to Feisty (and feisty to gutsy, and gutsy to hardy) the only way to skip is to go LTS to LTS (Dapper to Hardy)
2008-08-08T07:38:00.000Z	gabmed	Flannel	Humm...Ok! All do a clean instalation like td123 said
2008-08-08T07:49:00.000Z	gabmed	Flannel	I have the gutsy server, will I be able to mount +w a ntfs partition live from CD?
2008-08-08T07:49:00.000Z	Flannel	gabmed	I don't remember if Gutsy has write access by default
2008-08-08T07:50:00.000Z	gabmed	Flannel	But the server version has live cd?
2008-08-08T07:50:00.000Z	Flannel	gabmed	No, the server version isn't.  Its just an installer.
