2006-08-27T14:03:00.000Z	shawarma	Arafangion	Is there a bug about the inadequacies of ipw2200 in edgy?
2006-08-27T14:03:00.000Z	Arafangion	shawarma	Yes.
2006-08-27T14:04:00.000Z	shawarma	Arafangion	Bug number?
2006-08-27T14:04:00.000Z	Arafangion	shawarma	It simply doesn't want to work, though it's evidently fine in sarge and sid.
2006-08-27T14:04:00.000Z	Arafangion	shawarma	It's a Debian issue.
2006-08-27T14:05:00.000Z	shawarma	Arafangion	Last time i checked (which arguably is more than a year ago), Debian didn't ship binary ipw2200 drivers?
2006-08-27T14:06:00.000Z	Arafangion	shawarma	It does - in Sarge and Sid.
2006-08-27T14:06:00.000Z	shawarma	Arafangion	Also, how can it be a Debian issue that something works in Breezy and Dapper, but not in Etch?
2006-08-27T14:06:00.000Z	Arafangion	shawarma	Because Etch is Debian
2006-08-27T14:07:00.000Z	shawarma	Arafangion	Doh... of course. My bad!
2006-08-27T14:07:00.000Z	Arafangion	shawarma	Hence teh: 18:01 < Flannel> Arafangion: this is #ubuntu, not #debian
2006-08-27T14:08:00.000Z	shawarma	Arafangion	Hah, and when you said "sarge and sid" my mind read "breezy and dapper". :-)
2006-08-27T06:54:00.000Z	shawarma	Arafangion	umount -f
2006-08-27T06:55:00.000Z	Arafangion	shawarma	It's not working.
2006-08-27T06:55:00.000Z	Arafangion	shawarma	I can't even umount -r /home and get it read only.
2006-08-27T06:56:00.000Z	shawarma	Arafangion	umount -fl, then
2006-08-27T06:56:00.000Z	shawarma	Arafangion	Then it will be unmounted when the last blocking process leaves it.
2006-08-27T06:57:00.000Z	Arafangion	shawarma	Works well enough, thanks.
2006-08-27T06:57:00.000Z	shawarma	Arafangion	np
