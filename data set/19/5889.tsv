2008-06-05T07:45:00.000Z	amrik		what do people think of the human vs. human-murrine skins?
2008-06-05T07:45:00.000Z	zelrikriando	amrik	human skin is garbage
2008-06-05T07:45:00.000Z	amrik	zelrikriando	do you have recommendations?
2008-06-05T07:45:00.000Z	zelrikriando	amrik	human-murrine = advanced garbage?
2008-06-05T07:45:00.000Z	amrik	zelrikriando	i kind of like ubuntustudio but dont like how firefox looks
2008-06-05T07:46:00.000Z	zelrikriando	amrik	I have dodol and Wii-Black....both black themes though...so FF would be blah...
2008-06-05T07:46:00.000Z	amrik	zelrikriando	gah the eternal problem of firefox vs dark themes
2008-06-05T07:47:00.000Z	zelrikriando	amrik	I think Dodol is ok with FF
2008-06-05T07:47:00.000Z	zelrikriando	amrik	right now I have some vista-like theme that is kind of crap though :)
2008-06-05T07:48:00.000Z	amrik	zelrikriando	the vista replacements arent that great, and i get bored with them because i got too used to ubuntu
2008-06-05T07:51:00.000Z	zelrikriando	amrik	dodol is good, I just switched to it, some FF features are a bit unclear but still ok overall
2008-06-05T07:52:00.000Z	amrik	zelrikriando	it works great, except it still clashes pretty harshly with bright as white firefox
2008-06-05T07:53:00.000Z	amrik	zelrikriando	every release themes get brighter and brighter, eventually we are all goign to go blind
2008-06-05T07:54:00.000Z	zelrikriando	amrik	you mean the firefox pages?
2008-06-05T07:55:00.000Z	amrik	zelrikriando	 certain things in firefox such as the downloads box look out of place. the default skin for firefox really isnt meant for dark themes; is there a dark theme for FF?
2008-06-05T07:58:00.000Z	zelrikriando	amrik	mine doesnt look half bad
2008-06-05T08:05:00.000Z	zelrikriando	amrik	do you play a little with the parameters of gnome colors?
2008-06-05T08:06:00.000Z	amrik	zelrikriando	sometimes
2008-06-05T08:07:00.000Z	zelrikriando	amrik	I noticed the "bouton" colors of firefox are bound to the general theme...which makes it ugly
