2011-02-27T06:47:00.000Z	manster_		i believe that the disks have purpossfully bad blocks as some sort of copy protection
2011-02-27T06:49:00.000Z	manster_		any ideas?
2011-02-27T06:50:00.000Z	manster_		dont fuk with me
2011-02-27T06:50:00.000Z	manster_		if you cant help then shut it
2011-02-27T06:51:00.000Z	manster_		!ops?
2011-02-27T06:51:00.000Z	manster_		can someone tell me where i can ask my question
2011-02-27T06:51:00.000Z	manster_		i'm not sure who to ask
2011-02-27T06:51:00.000Z	manster_		and i think this is the wrong channel for it
2011-02-27T06:52:00.000Z	manster_		but i lack the knowledge to know who to ask about ddrescue stuff
2011-02-27T06:52:00.000Z	manster_		i apologize
2011-02-27T06:53:00.000Z	shcherbak	manster_	google "man ddrescue"
2011-02-27T06:54:00.000Z	manster_	shcherbak	i have been through several different options, all having some problem. i have adjusted blocksize, error retry, etc. but since i'm copying a 50gb at 2mb/s i cant really run through all possible options till i reach the right one
2011-02-27T06:55:00.000Z	manster_	shcherbak	i only come here after a week of googling and extensive efforts on my part
2011-02-27T06:56:00.000Z	shcherbak	manster_	what command fails, and why ddresque? photorec is more sensible choice.
2011-02-27T06:58:00.000Z	manster_	shcherbak	i will check it out
2011-02-27T06:59:00.000Z	manster_	shcherbak	photorec actually looks promising wish i had thought about it. well i'll start copying tonight, should probably know if it worked by tomorrow
2011-02-27T07:00:00.000Z	shcherbak	manster_	is it optical drive?
2011-02-27T07:00:00.000Z	manster_	shcherbak	yes shows up in /dev/sr0 its a blu-ray drive
2011-02-27T07:01:00.000Z	shcherbak	manster_	hm, do not know to much here...
