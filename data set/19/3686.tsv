2009-06-18T22:46:00.000Z	Pici	om26er	Linpus is not Ubuntu, Its probably best to seek out them for support.
2009-06-24T17:03:00.000Z	Pici	om26er	You may also want to take a look at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/PackagingGuide if you plan on packaging something for other users.
2009-07-21T22:53:00.000Z	Pici	om26er	This is the Ubuntu support channel, and that does not have anything to do with Ubuntu. Try #ubuntu-offtopic or #help
2009-10-27T20:59:00.000Z	Pici	om26er	No its not.
2009-10-27T21:00:00.000Z	Pici	om26er	No its not, please stop that.
