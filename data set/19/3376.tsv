2009-08-26T21:58:00.000Z	MancUUniAN_REd	Halitech	Whats a closet
2009-08-26T21:59:00.000Z	Halitech	MancUUniAN_REd	a place where you store cloaks and jackets and boots and umbrellas
2009-08-26T21:59:00.000Z	MancUUniAN_REd	Halitech	How can i hide it mate
2009-08-26T22:00:00.000Z	Halitech	MancUUniAN_REd	are you sure you mean CLOAK ?
2009-08-26T22:01:00.000Z	MancUUniAN_REd	Halitech	yes
2009-08-26T22:02:00.000Z	Halitech	MancUUniAN_REd	unless cloak means something different to you then it does me, a cloak is an old style jacket that they used to wear years ago
2009-08-26T22:02:00.000Z	Halitech	MancUUniAN_REd	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloak
2009-08-26T22:03:00.000Z	MancUUniAN_REd	Halitech	 I want to hide my IP
2009-08-26T22:04:00.000Z	Halitech	MancUUniAN_REd	you didn't say anything about your ip, you said how can I hide my cloak
2009-08-26T22:04:00.000Z	MancUUniAN_REd	Halitech	http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/IRC/Cloaks
2009-08-26T22:05:00.000Z	MancUUniAN_REd	Halitech	From this i thought cloak means IP
2009-08-26T22:05:00.000Z	Halitech	MancUUniAN_REd	basically you want a proxy
2009-08-26T22:09:00.000Z	Halitech	MancUUniAN_REd	from the context of what you posted to me, that is something else altogether and only relates to hiding your IP when you log into IRC
2009-08-26T22:24:00.000Z	Halitech	MancUUniAN_REd	ask someone on the page that you gave me the link for
