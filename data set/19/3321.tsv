2009-09-11T13:12:00.000Z	oobe	dharrison	phpmyadmin
2009-09-11T13:13:00.000Z	dharrison	oobe	I have phpmyadmin working ok. I am looking for an odbc connection
2009-09-11T13:13:00.000Z	oobe	dharrison	the-dude is right you need to get mysql to bin to your lan ip rather than localhost
2009-09-11T13:14:00.000Z	dharrison	oobe	where do I do that please?  :-)
2009-09-11T13:15:00.000Z	oobe	dharrison	this line bind-address            = 127.0.0.1 in /etc/mysql/my.cnf
2009-09-11T13:16:00.000Z	oobe	dharrison	actually you might not need to change that
2009-09-11T13:16:00.000Z	dharrison		oh right
2009-09-11T13:16:00.000Z	oobe		mine is set to localhost and remote pc's can still connect fine
2009-09-11T13:17:00.000Z	dharrison		oh  :-(
2009-09-11T13:17:00.000Z	dharrison		i can see the port is set ok 3306
2009-09-11T13:17:00.000Z	oobe	dharrison	check what port sql is listening on ps aux | grep sql | grep port
2009-09-11T13:18:00.000Z	oobe		that might be a good idea to start
2009-09-11T13:18:00.000Z	dharrison		i did a telnet on ubuntu localhost 3306 and works ok
2009-09-11T13:18:00.000Z	oobe		how are you trying to connect ?
2009-09-11T13:21:00.000Z	dharrison		i have the odbc mysql connector on my windows xp machine, and I have tried telnet as well
2009-09-11T13:21:00.000Z	dharrison		where do I check that I am granted access from my ip?
