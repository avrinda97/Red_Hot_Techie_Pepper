2009-09-06T03:26:00.000Z	Mrokii		hello. A a (still) Ubuntu-newbie i would like to know how I can start a file that is shown as "executable" on the desktop, but when I doubleclick it, I get the message that it can't be opened because "No application suitable for automatic installation is available for handling this kind of file"
2009-09-06T03:27:00.000Z	xangua	Mrokii	gnu/linux is not windows, it has is owns programs
2009-09-06T03:32:00.000Z	Mrokii	xangua	nope, the linux-version is free (at least that was said on one of the websites. It is downloadable here (the zip I downloaded): http://happypenguin.org/show?OceaniX
2009-09-06T03:40:00.000Z	xangua	Mrokii	right clic>properties>permissions>aloud execute the file as a program
2009-09-06T03:41:00.000Z	Mrokii	xangua	okay, will try next time I run into that issue. thanks as well
2010-05-03T13:07:00.000Z	xangua	Mrokii	you mean metacity compositing¿
2010-05-03T13:09:00.000Z	Mrokii	xangua	 I think so. I have an nvidia-graphicscard installed which workes fine. Only that suddenly compositing isn't working anymore.
2010-05-03T13:11:00.000Z	Mrokii	xangua	 Do you have any tips on that issue?
2012-01-26T20:52:00.000Z	xangua	Mrokii	it would make sence you share the output instead of especting us to guess ;)
2012-01-26T20:53:00.000Z	Mrokii	xangua	What output?
2012-01-26T20:53:00.000Z	xangua	Mrokii	sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
2012-01-26T20:59:00.000Z	Mrokii	xangua	Oops, sorry, I didn't mean Update-Manager, I meant Synaptic. I was just trying to install Midori and Synaptic wanted to remove a bunch of other apps totally unrelated to Midori.
2012-01-26T21:04:00.000Z	xangua	Mrokii	then try: sudp apt-get install midori
2012-01-26T21:11:00.000Z	Mrokii	xangua	There seems to be something wrong, as I get an "unmet dependencies"-error, regarding libwebkitgtk. And trying to reinstall it isn't working. Very strange.
2012-01-26T21:11:00.000Z	xangua	Mrokii	what ubuntu version are you using¿
2012-01-26T21:12:00.000Z	Mrokii	xangua	11.10
2012-01-26T21:13:00.000Z	xangua	Mrokii	tried the Fix option for apt¿ sudo apt-get install -f
2012-01-26T21:14:00.000Z	Mrokii	xangua	Yep, but that didn't change anything. Despite getting a "broken package"-message at some point, there does not really seem to be a broken package anywhere.
2012-03-26T01:42:00.000Z	Mrokii	xangua	Thanks.
