2011-02-13T08:58:00.000Z	boxbeatsy		hi, how do i go about making my external hard drive bootable? i'm trying to install a dual boot on my machine but have no CD ROM drive
2011-02-13T08:59:00.000Z	lukyjay	boxbeatsy	you need to load the boot selection menu, or BBS when your computer boots then select your harddrive
2011-02-13T08:59:00.000Z	boxbeatsy	lukyjay	do i need to clear my hard drive of all other files besides the windows files?
2011-02-13T08:59:00.000Z	boxbeatsy		it does connect via USB, but will my computer know where to find hte windows OS files?
2011-02-13T09:00:00.000Z	lukyjay	boxbeatsy	are you installing to or from the harddive?
2011-02-13T09:00:00.000Z	boxbeatsy		donti  need to specially format it somehow?
2011-02-13T09:00:00.000Z	boxbeatsy		from the harddrive
2011-02-13T09:00:00.000Z	boxbeatsy		i have ubuntu installed
2011-02-13T09:00:00.000Z	boxbeatsy		wnat to dual boot with windows thoguh
2011-02-13T09:00:00.000Z	lukyjay	boxbeatsy	do you have a USB stick? its much easier to install from than a portable harddrive
2011-02-13T09:01:00.000Z	boxbeatsy		i dont :\ although i could go buy one if it's a lot easier i guess
2011-02-13T09:01:00.000Z	boxbeatsy		how would i do it with a usb portable drive?
2011-02-13T09:01:00.000Z	lukyjay	boxbeatsy	in windows use unetbootin
2011-02-13T09:02:00.000Z	boxbeatsy		i'm looking at unetbootin right now.  it seems like it's only to create linux bootable drives?
2011-02-13T09:02:00.000Z	boxbeatsy		i dont have windows installed on the other hard drive, i just have an image of a windows boot CD
2011-02-13T09:04:00.000Z	boxbeatsy		aah found a resource guide: http://jaxov.com/2009/09/install-windows-7-from-usb-stick-easily-unetbootin/
2011-02-13T09:04:00.000Z	lukyjay	boxbeatsy	why don't you backup everything on the harddrive then use unetbootin to partition and write a bootable ubuntu image to it? that'd be the way to go!
2011-02-13T09:04:00.000Z	boxbeatsy		thanks guys!
2011-02-13T09:04:00.000Z	boxbeatsy	lukyjay	well i still need to figure out how to get windows on my main machine though
