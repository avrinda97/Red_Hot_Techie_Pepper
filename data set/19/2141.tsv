2012-09-11T16:20:00.000Z	dr_willis	^DEMOSS^	 time to build your own server then i guess and transfer stuff over
2012-09-11T16:26:00.000Z	dr_willis	^DEMOSS^	 you just said you were not using ubuntu.. but debian
2012-09-11T16:28:00.000Z	dr_willis	^DEMOSS^	 you are not being clear... the server is ubuntu. but your desktop is debian?
2012-09-11T16:30:00.000Z	dr_willis	^DEMOSS^	 you are confuseing people with what you are saying....
2012-09-11T16:31:00.000Z	dr_willis	^DEMOSS^	 if  your 10.10 server is dead. id build a new server, move the hard drive over and transfer the needed data, or use a live cd to transfer it over
2012-09-12T18:42:00.000Z	dr_willis	^DEMOSS^	 there was no need to set a root password. and it looksa like your windos partitions are all messed up or partioned weirdly
2012-09-12T18:31:00.000Z	dr_willis	^DEMOSS^	 pastebin the exact commands and exact error messages
2012-09-12T18:41:00.000Z	^DEMOSS^	dr_willis	what do you think about it ?
2012-09-12T18:43:00.000Z	^DEMOSS^	dr_willis	all parttitions are ext3
2012-09-12T18:43:00.000Z	dr_willis	^DEMOSS^	 whats the  original problem then?
2012-09-12T18:43:00.000Z	^DEMOSS^	dr_willis	i need delete /boot folder and reinstall grub again ?
2012-09-12T18:49:00.000Z	dr_willis	^DEMOSS^	 i would guess that you got some weird hard drive parrtitions going on.
