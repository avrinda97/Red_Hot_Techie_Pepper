2011-08-21T01:28:00.000Z	evan_		Hi, does anyone know if its at all possible for me to install windows 7 after ubuntu with 3 primary partitions?
2011-08-21T01:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	evan_	 should work fine
2011-08-21T01:29:00.000Z	evan_	Dr_Willis	I use gparted to make 50gb of unallocated space but when I tried to install windows 7 on it, it says that all the primary partitions were used
2011-08-21T01:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	evan_	 perhps ask in windows it may be a quirk of the installer.. you could pastebin the output of fdisk -l for us. Ubuntu does NOT need to be on primary partitions.
2011-08-21T01:31:00.000Z	evan_	Dr_Willis	do I need install something for that command to work? I am on minimal install
2011-08-21T01:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	evan_	 run fdisk and see if its installed..
2011-08-21T01:32:00.000Z	evan_	Dr_Willis	it shows a list of usage commands/options
2011-08-21T01:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	evan_	 so check/pastebin  outut of sudo fdisk -l
2011-08-21T01:36:00.000Z	evan_	Dr_Willis	http://pastebin.com/SHf4haQn
2011-08-21T01:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	evan_	 you have 4 primary partitiosn on sda.  and 1 on sdb - so what was the actual issue?
2011-08-21T01:39:00.000Z	evan_	Dr_Willis	when I try to install windows 7 on sdb it says the amount of this type of partition is at its max
2011-08-21T01:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	evan_	 make a ntfs partiton and see if the installer figures it out perhaps.
2011-08-21T01:40:00.000Z	evan_	Dr_Willis	ok, I will give that a try. thank you
2011-08-21T01:58:00.000Z	evan_	Dr_Willis	that sdb1 was my thumb drive partition. the 50gb of unallocated space is actually on sda
2011-08-21T01:58:00.000Z	evan_	Dr_Willis	my root/swap and home are all primary partitions
2011-08-21T01:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	evan_	 they dont need to be.
2011-08-21T01:59:00.000Z	evan_	Dr_Willis	is there anyway to change them?
2011-08-21T01:59:00.000Z	evan_	Dr_Willis	o :(
2011-08-21T02:00:00.000Z	evan_	Dr_Willis	i guess i'll back up my stuff and give it a shot then =D
