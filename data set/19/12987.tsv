2005-08-02T09:20:00.000Z	Last_in_Line		Hello
2005-08-02T09:21:00.000Z	Last_in_Line		I installed Ubuntu the other day & while it looks nice, it sure likes to mess with my mind.
2005-08-02T09:22:00.000Z	Last_in_Line		Anyone know what the default login & pass is for mysql?
2005-08-02T09:24:00.000Z	levander`	Last_in_Line	if you haven't changed anything, I think there's an anonymous user with no password.  Just type mysql from the same machine, and see if you get in.
2005-08-02T09:25:00.000Z	levander`	Last_in_Line	this is a fresh install, or you have been playing with it, configuring users, etc.
2005-08-02T09:27:00.000Z	levander`	Last_in_Line	try this: 'mysql -u root'
2005-08-02T09:30:00.000Z	levander`	Last_in_Line	somebody asked you if you were sure mysqld is runnning. Is it?
2005-08-02T09:30:00.000Z	levander`	Last_in_Line	'ps -ef | grep mysql'
2005-08-02T09:33:00.000Z	levander`	Last_in_Line	what? how could ps change your prompt?
2005-08-02T09:34:00.000Z	levander`	Last_in_Line	you weren't supposed to type in the '
2005-08-02T09:35:00.000Z	levander`	Last_in_Line	the 's I put on that command
2005-08-02T09:35:00.000Z	levander`	Last_in_Line	Ctrl-C to get out of that, they type 'ps -ef | grep mysql' - without the 's
2005-08-02T09:36:00.000Z	levander`	Last_in_Line	no ticks in what you type
2005-08-02T09:39:00.000Z	levander`	Last_in_Line	does what mean it's running?
2005-08-02T09:40:00.000Z	levander`	Last_in_Line	what what the output in the last column of that command I gave you.  Last column on every row of the output.
2005-08-02T09:40:00.000Z	levander`	Last_in_Line	that's just the process where you were grepping for mysql.  That's not mysql itself
2005-08-02T09:41:00.000Z	levander`	Last_in_Line	'/etc/init.d/mysql start' to start mysql, *NO TICKS*
2005-08-02T09:43:00.000Z	levander`	Last_in_Line	'less /var/log/syslog', go all the way to the bottom to find something mysql related
2005-08-02T10:14:00.000Z	levander`	Last_in_Line	you're trying some pretty advance stuff for a newb, it's not gonna be easy doing it that way
