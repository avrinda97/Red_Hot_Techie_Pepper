2010-09-24T00:20:00.000Z	edbian	mestar	Yes
2010-09-24T00:20:00.000Z	edbian	mestar	I don't even have to look at it.
2010-09-24T00:20:00.000Z	mestar	edbian	it says it requires windows to run so just curious
2010-09-24T00:20:00.000Z	edbian	mestar	They put that all over stuff.  Really drives me nuts.  Your monitor most certainly doesn't need windows to run either but they have no problem stamping their stupid stickers on it
2010-09-24T00:21:00.000Z	edbian	mestar	I suppose...
2010-09-24T00:22:00.000Z	edbian	mestar	Those things are a pain with linux
2010-09-24T00:23:00.000Z	edbian	mestar	Some are.  I can't tell you which are.  I don't have any
2010-09-24T00:28:00.000Z	edbian	mestar	I see no downside.
2010-09-24T00:28:00.000Z	edbian	mestar	What is your current set up?
2010-09-24T00:28:00.000Z	mestar	edbian	Windows 7 with ubuntu on a sepperate partition
2010-09-24T00:29:00.000Z	edbian	mestar	I don't see the downside of using linux exclusively :)
2010-09-24T00:29:00.000Z	edbian	mestar	You don't have to reinstall.  Boot a live CD and simply re-arrange the existing partitions so that the windows 7 one is gone and the linux one is expanded.  You might have to fix grub though.
2010-09-24T00:30:00.000Z	edbian	mestar	I've been windows free for 2 years.  It depends entirely on the person.
2010-09-24T00:30:00.000Z	edbian	mestar	Sounds to me like you're golden.
2010-09-24T00:30:00.000Z	edbian	mestar	You should be!  It's a great feeling :D
2010-09-24T00:31:00.000Z	edbian	mestar	That's how long it took me to make the switch
2010-09-24T00:32:00.000Z	edbian	mestar	Yep!
