2008-09-14T18:39:00.000Z	Philippe_		hi folks
2008-09-14T18:40:00.000Z	Philippe_		i've installed ubuntu (the new one) on win vista as it says in the installation
2008-09-14T18:41:00.000Z	Philippe_		but when i rebotted the computer i saw a L 99 99 99 screen
2008-09-14T18:41:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Philippe_	Do you mean using the Wubi installer while inside windows
2008-09-14T18:41:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Philippe_	I suggest you read the wubi faqs
2008-09-14T18:42:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Philippe_	FYI, I will not use nor recommend wubi... to anyone... so I cant help you with it
2008-09-14T18:43:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Philippe_	ok, so not a wubi install?
2008-09-14T18:44:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Philippe_	when you boot do you get a grub menu?
2008-09-14T18:44:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Philippe_	where you trying to install intrepid?
2008-09-14T18:45:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Philippe_	What version of Ubuntu.   the current release does not have that button
2008-09-14T18:45:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Philippe_	HArdy.. are you sure?
2008-09-14T18:46:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Philippe_	Sorry, I wont be of much help..
2008-09-14T18:48:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Philippe_	You should pastebin a full description of your hardware since the problem shows up under multiple distros
2008-09-14T18:50:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Philippe_	Too much of this makes no sense.  we dont use lilo unless you tried to add it off alternate or servercd
2008-09-14T18:51:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Philippe_	boot your windowscd into recovery mode and just do a fixmbr on it
2008-09-14T18:52:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Philippe_	if you dont know how to boot a windows cd this is going to take more time than I have..  try /join #windows
2008-09-14T18:52:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Philippe_	 try /join #windows   We dont do Vista...
2008-09-14T18:53:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Philippe_	and I honestly dont believe you when you say you are running ubuntu and now have a lilo error..
2008-09-14T18:54:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Philippe_	I am quite familiar with Ubuntu
