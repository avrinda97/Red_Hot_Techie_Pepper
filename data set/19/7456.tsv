2007-11-04T02:24:00.000Z	xIke_		anybody know where ubuntus kernels are?
2007-11-04T02:24:00.000Z	LjL	xIke_	"where" they are?
2007-11-04T02:25:00.000Z	xIke_	LjL	I'm having issues with one I was trying to compile...trying to track it down and get rid of it
2007-11-04T02:25:00.000Z	LjL	xIke_	if you were *compiling* it, only you can know where you put it
2007-11-04T02:27:00.000Z	LjL	xIke_	pastebin the exact errors please
2007-11-04T02:29:00.000Z	xIke_	LjL	http://pastebin.com/m4866d1fe

2007-11-04T02:39:00.000Z	LjL	xIke_	try doing "sudo dpkg -r linux-image-2.6.23.1" (of course, DON'T reboot before being sure you have a working kernel)
2007-11-04T02:42:00.000Z	xIke_	LjL	yeah, already tried that, it says that the package is in a inconsistent state and needs to be reinstalled first
2007-11-04T06:40:00.000Z	LjL	xIke_	it keeps a database.
2007-11-04T06:41:00.000Z	xIke_	LjL	how can I get inside that database and change stuff?
2007-11-04T06:41:00.000Z	LjL	xIke_	you most definitely shouldn't. if you're still stuck on your kernel problem - i'm sorry, i don't really know what to try, but i *assure* you that touching the database manually should really, really be the last attempt to make.
2007-11-04T06:43:00.000Z	xIke_	LjL	I know that if simply make it forget about the kernel install .deb all will be well
2007-11-04T06:43:00.000Z	LjL	xIke_	i doubt it.
2007-11-04T06:44:00.000Z	xIke_	LjL	well, the thing is, I killed that deb install really fast, and cleaned up my /usr/src...I just can't figure out how to keep apt-get and dpkg from complaining about the corrupt .deb
2007-11-04T06:53:00.000Z	LjL	xIke_	please try « sudo dpkg --force-remove-reinstreq -r <packagename> » (although i cannot guarantee this will not cause trouble)
2007-11-04T06:55:00.000Z	xIke_	LjL	that got it.
2007-11-04T06:55:00.000Z	xIke_	LjL	it complained, but then it worked
2007-11-04T06:55:00.000Z	LjL	xIke_	now make sure you have a proper kernel installed and listed in menu.lst before rebooting
