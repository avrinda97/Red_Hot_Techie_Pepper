2011-07-26T09:47:00.000Z	Northernen	rww	US based?
2011-07-26T09:24:00.000Z	rww	Northernen	2.0 came out in 1996. http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/timeline/cdf3cfeca3e82219ddcab20550e85406.png
2011-07-26T09:25:00.000Z	rww	Northernen	also, 3.0 is the latest stable. It's not "experimental".
2011-07-26T09:25:00.000Z	Northernen	rww	says 'latest stable kernel' is 2.39.3 on kernel.org? Or am I looking wrong?
2011-07-26T09:27:00.000Z	rww	Northernen	'mainline' is the most recent Linux release. 'stable' are kernels that have been out a while and are getting security and driver fixes backported to them.
2011-07-26T09:27:00.000Z	Northernen	rww	2.0 in 1996. Is it wrong to find the 3.0 release quite exciting then?
2011-07-26T09:27:00.000Z	Northernen	rww	oooh. I see.
2011-07-26T09:27:00.000Z	rww	Northernen	2.x to 3.x is an arbitrary version increment, it doesn't signify more major changes than 2.6.38 to 2.6.39

2011-07-26T09:44:00.000Z	Northernen	rww	doesn't it choose repos dynamically? I'm downloading from Norwegian servers.
2011-07-26T09:45:00.000Z	rww	Northernen	no
2011-07-26T09:45:00.000Z	Northernen	rww	repos based on keyboard layouts then?
2011-07-26T09:46:00.000Z	rww	Northernen	I have no idea. I'd suspect timezone.
2011-07-26T09:46:00.000Z	Northernen	rww	that would make more sense indeed.
2011-07-26T09:46:00.000Z	rww	Northernen	come to think of it, I accidentally selected a TZ in Canada once and ended up with ca.archive.ubuntu.com, so I think that is it.
2011-07-26T09:47:00.000Z	rww	Northernen	I live in California, yes.
2011-07-26T09:48:00.000Z	Northernen	rww	shouldn't be too much delay to Canadian servers then?
2011-07-26T09:48:00.000Z	rww	Northernen	There wasn't, no.
2011-07-26T10:22:00.000Z	Northernen	rww	rubbish computer if so :>
