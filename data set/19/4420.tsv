2010-01-30T15:47:00.000Z	airtonix	Jenk	also worth noting : windows cd/dvd creator via explorer does not create standard UDF discs.
2010-01-30T15:48:00.000Z	Jenk	airtonix	i've gone thru dat, changed the order of options... it doesn't work.
2010-01-30T15:50:00.000Z	airtonix	Jenk	sorry, i thought UDf was for dvd discs not dat tapes/
2010-01-30T15:50:00.000Z	Jenk	airtonix	k, bt n e oda ideas ?
2010-01-30T15:53:00.000Z	airtonix	Jenk	don't confuse my suggestions of urls to visit as a sign that I have any idea of the deeper workings with regards to UDF on linux. You didn't mention that you'd already investigated certain pathways so I took the liberty of providing the basics of google for you
2010-01-30T15:58:00.000Z	airtonix	Jenk	just a wild shot... have you bothered to try using nero for linux to read the udf disc?
2010-01-30T15:59:00.000Z	Jenk	airtonix	no, d dvd was burnt in Vista nd it doesn't open up here... 9.04
2010-01-30T15:59:00.000Z	airtonix	Jenk	so you have not bothered to try and use nero for linux to mount the udf disc and convert it to a proper ISO ?
2010-01-30T16:01:00.000Z	Jenk	airtonix	no hav neva heard dat der was a nero 4 linux bt s u say, i'll giv it a shot...
2010-01-30T16:01:00.000Z	airtonix	Jenk	btw i find your mangling of the english language to be offensive
2010-01-30T16:03:00.000Z	Jenk	airtonix	i've injured my hands and am typing using a pen in my mouth, the economics of typing dictate that it is easier to type short....
2010-01-30T16:04:00.000Z	airtonix	Jenk	I'm sorry you'll have to talk to another waiter if you want to order a different argument.
2010-01-30T16:04:00.000Z	airtonix	Jenk	that was my last idea : use nero for linux. all out of ideas
2010-01-30T16:06:00.000Z	Jenk	airtonix	with all due respect, i really meant what i said.... thanks for you help :-) !!
2010-01-30T16:06:00.000Z	airtonix	Jenk	I understand. if you are a monty python fan you will see where the waiter comment comes from
2010-01-30T16:08:00.000Z	Jenk	airtonix	thanks, will get back later if i can... gtg ;-) !
