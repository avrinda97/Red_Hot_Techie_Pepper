2011-09-08T21:17:00.000Z	Pici	mang0	you can't.  GNOME changed how gdm worked in recent releases, and it no longer supports the themes for prior versions.
2011-09-08T21:18:00.000Z	mang0	Pici	:O! That seems like a very backwards step :/. Is there any way to install new themes? Rather than GDM? GTK maybe...? Or is it not possible at all?
2011-09-08T21:19:00.000Z	Pici	mang0	I vaugely recall that you might be able to setup a default gtk theme to take effect, but I don't know how to do that.
2011-09-08T21:21:00.000Z	mang0	Pici	Aww, shame. Ah well :/
