2007-05-08T16:42:00.000Z	Answer	crabgrass	which files do you want to delete and how are you trying to delete them
2007-05-08T16:42:00.000Z	crabgrass	Answer	miscelanous media files, hitting [del]  and going to the trashcan and emptying it
2007-05-08T16:43:00.000Z	Answer	crabgrass	goto command line and try "rm -f filename"
2007-05-08T16:43:00.000Z	crabgrass	Answer	well, they're not there anymore, because i emptied the trash.
2007-05-08T16:44:00.000Z	crabgrass	Answer	it's safe to delete my .trashes , right?
2007-05-08T16:44:00.000Z	Answer	crabgrass	sorry I don't know about the trash... if you rm the file it will be deleted.
2007-05-08T16:44:00.000Z	crabgrass	Answer	alright, ty anyway.
2007-05-08T16:46:00.000Z	crabgrass	Answer	think logging out then in will get rid of that ghost trash?
2007-05-08T16:46:00.000Z	Answer	crabgrass	I don't think you deleted the files
2007-05-08T16:46:00.000Z	crabgrass	Answer	well, i don't know what else could have happened
2007-05-08T16:47:00.000Z	Answer	crabgrass	sounds like you just deleted pointers (shortcuts) which are only 1k files so it wouldn't save much space
2007-05-08T16:47:00.000Z	crabgrass	Answer	it's obvious i didn't, but im not sure how to delete them now, considering that the trash got emptied and they're no longer there
2007-05-08T16:47:00.000Z	crabgrass	Answer	you sure? these were files in ~/, that i put there.
2007-05-08T16:47:00.000Z	crabgrass	Answer	i dont recall setting up any pointers
2007-05-08T16:48:00.000Z	Answer	crabgrass	sounds strange.  I don't know
2007-05-08T16:48:00.000Z	crabgrass	Answer	yeah...
2007-05-08T16:48:00.000Z	crabgrass	Answer	i'll try logging out
