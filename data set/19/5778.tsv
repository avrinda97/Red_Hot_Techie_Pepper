2008-05-02T17:22:00.000Z	oga		question: "sudo gedit" runs at snails pace, (incredibly, unusable slow). while all other systems run normally
2008-05-02T17:24:00.000Z	oga		question: "sudo gedit" runs at snails pace, (incredibly, unusable slow). while all other systems run normally. any advice on how to debug? It's so bad that I cannot save an edited config file.
2008-05-02T17:25:00.000Z	tyler_roach	oga	technically, you should use gksudo gedit, not sudo.
2008-05-02T17:36:00.000Z	tyler_roach	oga	does your user have permssion to use sudo?
2008-05-02T17:36:00.000Z	oga	tyler_roach	yep....
2008-05-02T17:36:00.000Z	oga	tyler_roach	only user on pc
2008-05-02T17:37:00.000Z	tyler_roach	oga	are you working with a fresh install of hardy/
2008-05-02T17:38:00.000Z	oga	tyler_roach	upgrade 7.04=>7.10=>8.04
2008-05-02T17:38:00.000Z	tyler_roach	oga	this problem started after the upgrade?
2008-05-02T17:40:00.000Z	oga	tyler_roach	actually after the upgrade, was working... now isn't. Definitly was working pre upgrade
2008-05-02T17:40:00.000Z	tyler_roach	oga	what exactly is the error message?
2008-05-02T17:42:00.000Z	oga	tyler_roach	no error just runs at a rate that makes the program totally unusable, hangs on action (e.g. save, close etc.)
2008-05-02T17:43:00.000Z	tyler_roach	oga	graphical apps and the command line?
2008-05-02T17:44:00.000Z	oga	tyler_roach	yep, but i'm going to stuff around for a bit and see what i can get going, maybe problems with /etc/hosts as I manually changed user-desktop.(something) to user-desktop as part of debugging wifi (which is now working)
2008-05-02T17:47:00.000Z	tyler_roach	oga	that probably has something to do with it. Have you checked your /etc/hostname file?
2008-05-02T17:48:00.000Z	oga	tyler_roach	i have but i'm trying to remember what i changed itt from etc.
2008-05-02T17:48:00.000Z	tyler_roach	oga	run 'strace sudo su -' as root and see what happens.
