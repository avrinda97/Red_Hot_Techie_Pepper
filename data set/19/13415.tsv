2006-09-03T06:04:00.000Z	midgetg0at		i'm not used to the login screen :) it's all buggy for me
2006-09-03T06:04:00.000Z	midgetg0at		ctrl+alt+backspace likes to cause problems.

2006-09-03T06:05:00.000Z	midgetg0at		dont suggest people not play w/ the kernel - how do people learn?
2006-09-03T06:05:00.000Z	midgetg0at		Holycow - still around?
2006-09-03T06:07:00.000Z	midgetg0at		well....i figured you could peep my bin and contrast it to yours - something might jump out at you...
2006-09-03T06:07:00.000Z	midgetg0at		http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/22423 - i want my two monitors to span (keyword here) the desktop - any ideas?
2006-09-03T06:07:00.000Z	falcon3	midgetg0at	xinerama
2006-09-03T06:08:00.000Z	falcon3	midgetg0at	think your sources might be a bit off
2006-09-03T06:09:00.000Z	falcon3	midgetg0at	correct,
2006-09-03T06:09:00.000Z	falcon3	midgetg0at	you can expand your desktop without xinerama, but movies andsoforth will span over your two monitors too
2006-09-03T06:10:00.000Z	falcon3	midgetg0at	the only solution i know to that is xinerama
2006-09-03T06:10:00.000Z	falcon3	midgetg0at	runnign two X servers for each screen is a solution
2006-09-03T06:16:00.000Z	falcon3	midgetg0at	yes, that's a default setup
2006-09-03T06:16:00.000Z	falcon3	midgetg0at	but that will, as i said before, span
