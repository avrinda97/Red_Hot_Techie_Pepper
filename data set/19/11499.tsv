2006-01-12T11:27:00.000Z	s_spiff		can a newbie raise his doubts here or is there another channel for it?
2006-01-12T11:28:00.000Z	s_spiff		using both ubuntu and added kde about 2 days back.
2006-01-12T11:28:00.000Z	s_spiff		ohh ok
2006-01-12T11:29:00.000Z	s_spiff		are there any scripts for x-chat? like i used !euphoria for mIRC in windows
2006-01-12T11:31:00.000Z	s_spiff		can someone help me with a firewall? I want to install one without disrupting my connection.
2006-01-12T11:31:00.000Z	s_spiff		ok
2006-01-12T11:31:00.000Z	s_spiff		thanks
2006-01-12T11:32:00.000Z	brenner	s_spiff	might want to ask in #xchat on the scripts.  the guys in there are pretty cool
2006-01-13T06:57:00.000Z	brenner	s_spiff	yes, but like it says, some of the content may be weird when you open it in ms office
2006-01-13T06:58:00.000Z	brenner	s_spiff	possibly.  i'm not sure what your font setup is like
2006-01-13T06:59:00.000Z	brenner	s_spiff	hang on.  i'm gonna try save a doc
2006-01-13T07:00:00.000Z	s_spiff	brenner	if I install a program, how to create a shortcut icon for it on the desktop? otherwise I'll have to go into the terminal all the time and then type out the command, which I think is sort of paionful
2006-01-13T07:00:00.000Z	brenner	s_spiff	i get it the warning too.
2006-01-13T07:02:00.000Z	brenner	s_spiff	i think it's more of a general warning...compatibility with ms' document format ain't perfect
2006-01-13T09:25:00.000Z	brenner	s_spiff	how'd you install it?
2006-01-13T09:29:00.000Z	brenner	s_spiff	recommended way is to install kubuntu-desktop, then choose kde from the sessions menu at login
2006-01-13T09:32:00.000Z	brenner	s_spiff	why would kubuntu-desktop install gnome?
2006-01-14T09:16:00.000Z	brenner	s_spiff	that's why you should make a seperate partition for /home
