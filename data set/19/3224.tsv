2009-09-26T10:04:00.000Z	LinuX2half		does it stand for virtual machine?
2009-09-26T10:05:00.000Z	LinuX2half		so how do I install a VMware to my computer
2009-09-26T10:07:00.000Z	LinuX2half		so how do I  install  window VM?
2009-09-26T10:08:00.000Z	LinuX2half		yeah, I need windows to run itunes.
2009-09-26T10:09:00.000Z	draconis	LinuX2half	oh, wait.. y ou will need the proprietary VirtualBox, not VirtualBox-OSE
2009-09-26T10:09:00.000Z	draconis	LinuX2half	since you need the USB passthrough feature
2009-09-26T10:10:00.000Z	draconis	LinuX2half	but, why not just use rhythmbox or whatever's sync?
2009-09-26T10:11:00.000Z	draconis	LinuX2half	what was your issue getting ipod sync natively?
2009-09-26T10:13:00.000Z	LinuX2half	draconis	I currently haven't tried to connect my ipod to my computer, but I've heard that ipod phone/touch can't be used fully on any programs except itunes.
2009-09-26T10:13:00.000Z	draconis	LinuX2half	i guess, but I know rhythmbox also has support
2009-09-26T10:13:00.000Z	draconis	LinuX2half	I've been told that some of the later ones cannot sync properly unless you jailbreak them
2009-09-26T10:13:00.000Z	draconis	LinuX2half	though I'm not sure if that's true

2009-09-26T10:15:00.000Z	draconis	LinuX2half	this might not be valid, but it probably is
2009-09-26T10:18:00.000Z	LinuX2half	draconis	okay..so I have to compile gtkpod manually...it seemed that this takes some time to complete...
2009-09-26T10:18:00.000Z	draconis	LinuX2half	rhythmbox should have libgpod already...
2009-09-26T10:19:00.000Z	LinuX2half	draconis	well rhythmbox is for playback and gtkpod is for sync
