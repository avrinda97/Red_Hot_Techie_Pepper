2007-01-10T11:59:00.000Z	gaubong	svfusion	You can undo all what you have done to install it.
2007-01-10T12:00:00.000Z	gaubong	svfusion	First, you can use Synaptics to uninstall all packages you have installed.
2007-01-10T12:00:00.000Z	gaubong	svfusion	Those fglrx packages.
2007-01-10T12:01:00.000Z	gaubong	svfusion	OK, not really needed to uninstall these.
2007-01-10T12:02:00.000Z	gaubong	svfusion	The easiest way is to copy the backup version of xorg.conf
2007-01-10T12:02:00.000Z	gaubong	svfusion	Go to /etc/X11
2007-01-10T12:02:00.000Z	gaubong	svfusion	You can find xorg.conf.original...
2007-01-10T12:02:00.000Z	gaubong	svfusion	Something like that.
2007-01-10T12:02:00.000Z	gaubong	svfusion	Overide your xorg.conf with that file.
