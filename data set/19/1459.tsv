2012-02-18T17:33:00.000Z	nishttal2		is anyone around?
2012-02-18T17:34:00.000Z	nishttal2		good morning guys.. its 7:30 am here on a saturday.. thats why asked..
2012-02-18T17:34:00.000Z	nishttal2		i just installed 10.10 on my macbook pro.. everything looks great except for 2 very crippling issues
2012-02-18T17:34:00.000Z	nishttal2		1) there is no sound
2012-02-18T17:35:00.000Z	nishttal2		2) bootup takes 10 minutes (literally).. most of the time 9mins it sits on a blank screen with just a blinking cursor at top left of the screen
2012-02-18T17:35:00.000Z	nishttal2		can someone help ?
2012-02-18T17:36:00.000Z	bc81	nishttal2	have you checked the integrity of the install image?
2012-02-18T17:38:00.000Z	bc81	nishttal2	when you download the image, you should check the integrity of the file (also if you burn it to a cd)
2012-02-18T17:42:00.000Z	bc81	nishttal2	this might be a good starting point: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MacBook  also, you might need sound drivers
2012-02-18T17:45:00.000Z	bc81	nishttal2	then maybe reinstall (or check the integrity of installation disk)
2012-02-18T17:46:00.000Z	nishttal2	bc81	i have installed several times and different versions (10.10 32-bit/64-bit, 11.04 32/64 bit) sound is always an issue
2012-02-18T17:47:00.000Z	bc81	nishttal2	have you looked at system>administration>additional drivers (for your sound issue)
2012-02-18T17:48:00.000Z	nishttal2	bc81	4 drivers popped up.. 2 nvidia and 2 wireless cards
2012-02-18T17:48:00.000Z	bc81	nishttal2	system>administration>log file viewer..or when it's booting/hangs i believe you can press escape to see real-time messages
2012-02-18T17:48:00.000Z	nishttal2	bc81	nothing for sounf
2012-02-18T17:49:00.000Z	bc81	nishttal2	sound is working in live-cd environments or no?
2012-02-18T17:49:00.000Z	nishttal2	bc81	i didnt check the livecd.. went straight to install
2012-02-18T17:58:00.000Z	bc81	nishttal2	epochal-rooted seconds.  convert to real-time by removing the decimal point and running for e.g.  date -d "@2806411"
