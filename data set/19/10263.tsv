2006-07-05T13:07:00.000Z	tufsy		my smp 686 kernel is making one of my cpus go up to 100% continuously [seems to be the wireless]  - now when i reboot into a 386 kernel [not smp]  the one cpu working is only on 5% ish. is there a way of using two cpus [smp]  with a 386 kernel?

2006-07-05T13:10:00.000Z	erUSUL	tufsy	maybe the wifi driver is not smp safe (ndiswrapper perhaps?)
2006-07-05T13:13:00.000Z	tufsy	erUSUL	i tried to kill the ipw3945/0  process - which was taking 100% of one of the cpus
2006-07-05T13:14:00.000Z	erUSUL	tufsy	it is one of he newer intel cards. the ones that need a binary daemon running?
2006-07-05T13:15:00.000Z	tufsy	erUSUL	it is a centrino dell 9400 inspiron machine. so it is new
2006-07-05T13:16:00.000Z	tufsy	erUSUL	the wifi light keeps flashing under linux - but under windows it is always lit
2006-07-05T13:16:00.000Z	erUSUL	tufsy	then the problem is with that  ipw3945 process no the kernel itself...
2006-07-05T13:16:00.000Z	tufsy	erUSUL	ok so how do i fix it?
2006-07-05T13:18:00.000Z	erUSUL	tufsy	i do not know... maybe you can download a newer version of the daemon or use a nwer kernel
2006-07-05T13:18:00.000Z	tufsy	erUSUL	how do i get a newer kernel under ubuntu?
2006-07-05T13:20:00.000Z	tufsy	erUSUL	how do i get a newer kernel under ubuntu?
2006-07-15T08:41:00.000Z	erUSUL	tufsy	audacity?
