2006-08-24T12:44:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	masterchief	I'll tell you a step by step guide, but you must follow it exactly.
2006-08-24T12:47:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	masterchief	step 1 is to go to https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats#head-f375cba46014e861cd5ec7643bd7c4ef05acff2b
2006-08-24T12:49:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	masterchief	read that page
2006-08-24T12:50:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	masterchief	are you reading the page I told you to go to?
2006-08-24T12:55:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	masterchief	I already told you how to get it done the easy way, but apparently, you want to do it the (wrong) way, so go ahead :)
2006-08-24T13:31:00.000Z	masterchief	fyrestrtr	dont blame me because i never used ubuntu before
2006-08-24T13:31:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	masterchief	I'm not blaming you for anything?
2006-08-24T13:33:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	masterchief	sudo apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree
2006-08-24T13:37:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	masterchief	enable the universe and multiverse repositories. As I told you, go here https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats -- all instructions are there to get this going.
