2011-02-11T10:16:00.000Z	GeekyAdam		anyone using multiple monitors?
2011-02-11T10:17:00.000Z	jack_	GeekyAdam	i use dual monitor on fedora if that helps.
2011-02-11T10:17:00.000Z	jack_	GeekyAdam	i use the nvidida untility to setup dual monitors
2011-02-11T10:17:00.000Z	GeekyAdam	jack_	do you use seperate x screens?
2011-02-11T10:17:00.000Z	jack_	GeekyAdam	no. twinview
2011-02-11T10:18:00.000Z	GeekyAdam	jack_	im trying to setup seperate x screens for each monitor. had it before but reinstalled now i cant figure it out.
2011-02-11T10:19:00.000Z	jack_	GeekyAdam	if you're using nvidida why not use the nvidia gui utility? :D
2011-02-11T10:19:00.000Z	GeekyAdam	jack_	tried. still not working right.
2011-02-11T10:19:00.000Z	jack_	GeekyAdam	be sure to run it with sudo and to save the xorg file before applying the settings
2011-02-11T10:21:00.000Z	jack_	GeekyAdam	seperate x screens almost looks like 2 seperate machiens running. they're instances of the xserver
2011-02-11T10:21:00.000Z	jack_	GeekyAdam	twinview makes 2 monitors act as one viewing plane and you can drag windows bakc and forth
2011-02-11T10:23:00.000Z	GeekyAdam	jack_	i know that i guess. i just know for a fact that i used to be able to drag across all three screens, and each screen had its own wallpaper. when i set up twinview on two of themonitors the wallpaper stretches across both.
2011-02-11T10:23:00.000Z	jack_	GeekyAdam	i think thats a bug
2011-02-11T10:23:00.000Z	jack_	GeekyAdam	or a setting now
2011-02-11T10:23:00.000Z	GeekyAdam	jack_	what do you mean? the wallpaper stretching?
2011-02-11T10:23:00.000Z	jack_	GeekyAdam	yes
2011-02-11T10:29:00.000Z	jack_	GeekyAdam	you want to take a look at my config?
2011-02-11T10:29:00.000Z	GeekyAdam	jack_	yeah sure
