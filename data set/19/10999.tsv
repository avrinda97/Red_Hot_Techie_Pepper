2007-06-11T15:40:00.000Z	comrade		i have an issue with an ati radeon 9600 usnig the fglrx driver, it seems to crash when I switch from X to a veritual console via alt-tab, has anyone expierenced the same thing or have any work arounds
2007-06-11T15:41:00.000Z	maccam94	comrade	that sounds familiar, it may be a bug
2007-06-11T15:41:00.000Z	comrade	maccam94	it happens in ubuntu and arch so I think it is, it's odd though it doesn't affect my laptop which uses radeon m200 express
2007-06-11T15:41:00.000Z	comrade	maccam94	was just checking to see if anyone had work arounds though
2007-06-11T15:42:00.000Z	maccam94	comrade	there might be, lemme google it
2007-06-11T15:42:00.000Z	comrade	maccam94	haha you don't gotta do that, I already tried, and don't expect you to go that far
2007-06-11T15:46:00.000Z	maccam94	comrade	are you using fglrx or the xorg-ati driver?
2007-06-11T15:46:00.000Z	comrade		fglrx
2007-06-11T15:46:00.000Z	comrade		i think its a bug for sure
2007-06-11T15:46:00.000Z	maccam94	comrade	yeah, i think i remember that from the days i used gentoo with one of those cards
2007-06-11T15:46:00.000Z	maccam94		try the xorg driver
2007-06-11T15:46:00.000Z	comrade		nah its too slow
2007-06-11T15:46:00.000Z	maccam94	comrade	ooo
2007-06-11T15:47:00.000Z	maccam94		i think i got it
2007-06-11T15:47:00.000Z	comrade		thanks though, the xorg is a lot more reliable but its slow as hell compared to fglrx

2007-06-11T15:47:00.000Z	maccam94		i think that did it for me a while back
2007-06-11T15:48:00.000Z	comrade	maccam94	alright I'll give it a try and see what happens
2007-06-11T15:53:00.000Z	comrade	maccam94	still crashes :/, damn ati and their lame drivers
