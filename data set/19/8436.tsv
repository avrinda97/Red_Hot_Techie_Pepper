2007-03-30T07:50:00.000Z	Zehava	Death_Sargent	there is no make file
2007-03-30T07:51:00.000Z	Zehava	Death_Sargent	I appologize, need to read slower before I respond.  The qmake.conf is there aswell?
2007-03-30T07:52:00.000Z	Zehava	Death_Sargent	do 'locate qmake.conf' and see if the path that it shows you there /usr/share/qt3/mkspecs/default/qmake.conf is the correct path to the file
2007-03-30T07:53:00.000Z	Zehava	Death_Sargent	that is correct, that file is not there
