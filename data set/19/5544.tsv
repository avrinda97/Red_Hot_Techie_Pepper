2008-06-09T20:47:00.000Z	cognatus		yes eviltim TecnoBrat had the right burner
2008-06-09T20:47:00.000Z	cognatus		then, eviltim, just drag the .iso into cdbxp and it'll ask you if you want to use it to create a cd

2008-06-09T20:49:00.000Z	cognatus		on that topic... i'm trying to reinstall GRUB and getting "Could not find device for /boot: Not found or not a block device." does anyone have any ideas?
2008-06-09T20:50:00.000Z	cognatus		wow TecnoBrat
2008-06-09T20:50:00.000Z	TecnoBrat	cognatus	what are you doing exactly?
2008-06-09T20:51:00.000Z	TecnoBrat	cognatus	type "find /boot/grub/stage1"
2008-06-09T20:51:00.000Z	cognatus	TecnoBrat	i was trying to move /home to its own partition, wound up messing things up so i just reinstalled ubuntu from the live cd i used originally. except i accidentally told it to install grub to (hd0) when i SHOULD have installed it to (hd2) [trust me, it IS hd2]
2008-06-09T20:51:00.000Z	cognatus	TecnoBrat	Error 15: File not found
2008-06-09T20:52:00.000Z	TecnoBrat		:(
2008-06-09T20:52:00.000Z	cognatus		i'm trying grub-install but i get that error
2008-06-09T20:52:00.000Z	cognatus		Could not find device for /boot: Not found or not a block device.
2008-06-09T20:54:00.000Z	TecnoBrat		You tried doing "root (hd2,3)" <= change with your linux partition, and then "setup (hd2)"?
2008-06-09T20:54:00.000Z	cognatus	TecnoBrat	well, no, because the find command isn't working to begin with
