2006-02-18T11:13:00.000Z	drummer		Help!  I can no longer get clean su access and several devices are suddenly saying permission denied!!!!!
2006-02-18T11:13:00.000Z	gnomefreak	drummer	sudo not su
2006-02-18T11:14:00.000Z	drummer	gnomefreak	 the message for several things is: "conversation with su failed."
2006-02-18T11:14:00.000Z	gnomefreak	drummer	did you enable su?
2006-02-18T11:15:00.000Z	drummer	gnomefreak	 yes  but makes no difference whether I try the root password for the sudo password.
2006-02-18T11:15:00.000Z	gnomefreak	drummer	it does in a way there is a reason why su is not enabled
2006-02-18T11:16:00.000Z	drummer	gnomefreak	 ???  I do not understand.
2006-02-18T11:17:00.000Z	gnomefreak	drummer	hold on a min
2006-02-18T11:19:00.000Z	drummer	gnomefreak	 Will do.  First discovered the problem when i logged in this morn & the system said it could not initialize sound /dev/dsp because permission denied.  Then I discovered I couldn't get sudo access nor su acces to all kinds of things.
2006-02-18T11:25:00.000Z	gnomefreak	drummer	drummer whos is named in the /etc/sudoers file?
2006-02-18T11:30:00.000Z	drummer	gnomefreak	I'll take a quick look there.
2006-02-18T11:30:00.000Z	gnomefreak	drummer	i really think the su is conflicting with sudo and now neither work but im not 100% on that
2006-02-18T11:34:00.000Z	drummer	gnomefreak	Ok I read the page.  How does that impact my situation?  I cannot run Synaptic nor several other packages - When I type in my sudo password - the package does not run.  I have NO sound, on boot it says permission denied for /dev/dsp  I can go on - but....
2006-02-18T11:36:00.000Z	gnomefreak	drummer	if enabling su screwed up your sudoers than i would suggest getting rid of su (people come in here all the time with su issues affecting sudo)
2006-02-18T11:37:00.000Z	drummer	gnomefreak	I can disable su access easily enough - but will that ficx the problem - (and if so How?)
2006-02-18T11:37:00.000Z	drummer	gnomefreak	ficx = fix
2006-02-18T11:38:00.000Z	gnomefreak	drummer	if the 2 are conflicting it might but from what ive seen people having to add themselves again
2006-02-18T11:39:00.000Z	drummer	gnomefreak	Uh, if i do not have access to root and my current login sudo has screwed the pooch, how do I "add myself" again?
2006-02-18T11:47:00.000Z	drummer	gnomefreak	 you are correct - I cannot run jack - my sudo access seems to be totally screwed.
