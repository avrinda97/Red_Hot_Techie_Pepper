2007-09-20T08:46:00.000Z	cje_		thx
2007-09-20T08:48:00.000Z	mindrape	cje_	its piping  ;)
2007-09-20T08:44:00.000Z	mindrape	cje_	- cat /etc/passwd | sort
2007-09-20T08:44:00.000Z	cje_	mindrape	thx, I'll try that.
2007-09-20T08:48:00.000Z	mindrape	cje_	- if you want JUST the names I can give you some syntax for that... /etc/passwd has a lot of other info you prolly dont need.  ;)
2007-09-20T08:48:00.000Z	cje_	mindrape	actually that would be good to know, thanks.
2007-09-20T08:48:00.000Z	cje_	mindrape	that command was really interesting.
2007-09-20T08:49:00.000Z	cje_	mindrape	it does produce quite some useful output.
2007-09-20T08:49:00.000Z	cje_	mindrape	I have used piping before, and it sure is fun, but I continue to be impressed with the power of the command line.
2007-09-20T08:50:00.000Z	cje_	mindrape	but I would not be able to use the command line without good help such as is available here, so thanks!
2007-09-20T08:54:00.000Z	mindrape	cje_	- try this command... cat /etc/passwd | sort | awk -F ":" '{ name = $(NF-6); printf("%s\n", name); }'
2007-09-20T08:58:00.000Z	cje_	mindrape	thanks, that last command that you gave me worked.
2007-09-20T08:58:00.000Z	mindrape	cje_	- Kr0ntab's is probably easier (to type and explain - incase you want to teach your students)
2007-09-20T09:00:00.000Z	cje_	mindrape	thanks for the suggestion, but this is a poor public middle school in San Francisco, and it has taken me 2.5 years to be able to teach them how to use OOo.  Snicker.
2007-09-20T09:00:00.000Z	cje_	mindrape	I am building them up really really slowly.
2007-09-20T09:00:00.000Z	mindrape	cje_	- you should make them earn a GUI... to the CLI!  heh
2007-09-20T09:03:00.000Z	cje_	mindrape	I am seeing that the excellent CLI command that you gave me prints the user name alphabetically.  Is there a way to print it alphabetically via last name?
2007-09-20T09:03:00.000Z	cje_	mindrape	I am noticing that the last names are in the /etc/passwd file.
2007-09-20T09:09:00.000Z	cje_	mindrape	I'm getting ready to go home.  Thanks for your help!
