2007-06-03T08:06:00.000Z	Nostferka		preference
2007-06-03T08:06:00.000Z	Nostferka		not a lot of difference is tehre?
2007-06-03T08:06:00.000Z	Nostferka		apt-get is easier to type too
2007-06-03T08:07:00.000Z	Nostferka		yeah
2007-06-03T08:08:00.000Z	Nostferka		why dunt ubuntu come with those packages already?
2007-06-03T08:08:00.000Z	Nostferka		as in the gcc
2007-06-03T08:09:00.000Z	kbrooks	Nostferka	Ubuntu is designed for the desktop.
2007-06-03T08:10:00.000Z	kbrooks	Nostferka	erm...
2007-06-03T08:11:00.000Z	kbrooks	Nostferka	some data for you
2007-06-03T08:12:00.000Z	kbrooks	Nostferka	if you really must insdtall things in awkward, non-supported ways, at least make them less awkward with (see ur pm)
2007-06-03T08:13:00.000Z	Nostferka	kbrooks	i didnt know you could do that
2007-06-03T08:14:00.000Z	kbrooks	Nostferka	to clear up a myth: you can pass checkinstall a command with the -c option. this command must install files though (not just compile). the default command is "make install"
2007-06-03T08:16:00.000Z	kbrooks	Nostferka	well, ./configure checks the system for things and configures the package for the system... and makie compiles the packages. and then make install is supposed to copy the package and all data files to system admin directories.
2007-06-03T08:16:00.000Z	kbrooks	Nostferka	read: "is supposed to"
2007-06-03T08:18:00.000Z	kbrooks	Nostferka	because it all starts with source. fortunately, many people have done the "./configure && make && make install"  system for you and wraps the data into packages
2007-06-03T08:19:00.000Z	kbrooks	Nostferka	hence my need to put those four factoids at you so that you learn more
2007-06-03T08:19:00.000Z	kbrooks	Nostferka	and not waste your time uh compiling stuff
2007-06-03T08:20:00.000Z	kbrooks	Nostferka	np, we're here to help.
