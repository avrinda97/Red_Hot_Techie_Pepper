2011-03-29T06:28:00.000Z	lasha		hey guys I have a question about mounting partition at ubuntu startup, I have a data partition which doesnt get mounted automatically at startup and everytime I need to mount manually, anyone knows how to solve this ?> thank you
2011-03-29T06:30:00.000Z	perlmonkey	lasha	add entry in /etc/mtab
2011-03-29T06:31:00.000Z	lasha	perlmonkey	how do I do that ? add what entry ?
2011-03-29T06:31:00.000Z	perlmonkey	lasha	edit mtab and put a line in for the partition you want to mount
2011-03-29T06:32:00.000Z	lasha	perlmonkey	how do I edit mtab I never dealt with it :\
2011-03-29T06:32:00.000Z	lasha	perlmonkey	do i just run mtab from run terminal ?
2011-03-29T06:32:00.000Z	perlmonkey	lasha	you need to read up on this, there's howto...but you can edit mtab with vi or some other shell editor
2011-03-29T06:33:00.000Z	lasha	perlmonkey	ok thank you :) I ll research on it
2011-03-29T06:33:00.000Z	perlmonkey	lasha	mtab is just a list of partitions or devices to be mounted at boot up
2011-03-29T06:33:00.000Z	perlmonkey	lasha	put your entry at bottom
2011-03-29T06:34:00.000Z	lasha	perlmonkey	ok I ll do :)
2011-03-29T06:36:00.000Z	perlmonkey	lasha	"mount" at shell will show you what devices you mounted, and "mount -all" will reload/mount all devices in mtab
2011-03-29T06:37:00.000Z	lasha	perlmonkey	I entered fstab but how do I open mtab file ?
2011-03-29T06:39:00.000Z	perlmonkey	lasha	to edit "sudo vi fstab" but make a copy before you change it, "sudo cp fstab fstab.bak"
2011-03-29T06:40:00.000Z	lasha	perlmonkey	ok I am currently tinkering with it one sek i ll let you know if i am successful
2011-03-29T07:04:00.000Z	lasha	perlmonkey	http://enli.co.cc/tutorials/automount-partitions-in-ubuntu-at-startup/ great tutorial!
2011-03-29T07:04:00.000Z	perlmonkey	lasha	thanks
2011-03-29T07:05:00.000Z	perlmonkey	lasha	I mount my partition via NFS across my network on 3 machines, so my /home is always the same/centralised
2011-03-29T07:05:00.000Z	lasha	perlmonkey	its short and it works so keep it in mind if anyone has a problem :P
