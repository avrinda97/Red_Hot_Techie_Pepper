2010-04-10T05:17:00.000Z	cloudlevi		So anyone know what the Ubuntu equivalent to Device Manager is?
2010-04-10T05:18:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	cloudlevi	not that I know of personally, there's various tools, depends on what you want to achieve
2010-04-10T05:19:00.000Z	cloudlevi	psycho_oreos	Trying to scan my Bluetooth dongle. No Ubuntu native drivers for the pup, so I've gotta find out its model or serial considering it's unmarked and I swear to all it was repackaged.
2010-04-10T05:19:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	cloudlevi	there's a CLI tool called lsusb
2010-04-10T05:20:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	cloudlevi	open up terminal and type that command in
2010-04-10T05:21:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	cloudlevi	open up terminal and type in "lsusb" (without quotes)
2010-04-10T05:23:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	cloudlevi	probably the other 3 are just USB headers (i.e. there's soldering point for it but no actual hardware bits are soldered onto it and made visible outside the machine
2010-04-10T05:24:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	cloudlevi	there's lots of other potential variables but that's not ubuntu related
2010-04-10T05:26:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	cloudlevi	doesn't really help, what you actually need is the pci:id or in this case the usb:id, which is in the form of XXXX:XXXX
2010-04-10T05:30:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	cloudlevi	no, probably not a good idea, just pastebin (not paste) your lsusb output
2010-04-10T05:40:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	cloudlevi	have you pastebinned your lsusb output?
2010-04-10T05:40:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	cloudlevi	it allows simpler pasting, without using hand to paste any outputs
2010-04-10T05:44:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	cloudlevi	into a website called pastebin.. like pastebin.com
2010-04-10T05:45:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	cloudlevi	well whichever, but for convenience sake use that
2010-04-10T05:46:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	cloudlevi	so that I can see what you're seeing and maybe able to assist you further without you venturing back to windows or pasting more than 3 lines into this channel and getting silenced by the bots for flooding
2010-04-10T05:47:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	cloudlevi	1131:1004 <--- that is the most important valuable piece of info you'll need fyi
2010-04-10T05:48:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	cloudlevi	remember that same line you pasted to me something about integrated corp? and I said that piece of info is useless, what I need is the pci:id or in this case the usb:id of the device, which is on the same line as that thing you pasted
2010-04-10T05:49:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	cloudlevi	with that bit of info you can paste that directly into google query and see the support info/status on the device, etc
2010-04-10T05:50:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	cloudlevi	either way is up to you, if you want to learn, probably a good idea is to start filtering out yourself :) good practise
