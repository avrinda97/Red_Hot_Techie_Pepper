2005-02-21T09:11:00.000Z	ewhitten_		mornin.
2005-02-21T09:13:00.000Z	ewhitten_		nice
2005-02-21T09:15:00.000Z	TreadingSoftly	ewhitten_	Beagle's gobbling up most of your RAM? is that constant?
2005-02-21T09:16:00.000Z	ewhitten_	TreadingSoftly	 at the moment, yes.  I'm waiting to see if it will go down after the initial index, but I'm not so optimistic.  beagle still can be a pain.
2005-02-21T09:16:00.000Z	TreadingSoftly	ewhitten_	are you running it on Hoary?
2005-02-21T09:16:00.000Z	ewhitten_	TreadingSoftly	 yup.
2005-02-21T09:17:00.000Z	TreadingSoftly	ewhitten_	did you include gst-sharp?
2005-02-21T09:17:00.000Z	ewhitten_	TreadingSoftly	 I couldn't get it to compile after I checked it out of svn this morning.
2005-02-21T09:17:00.000Z	TreadingSoftly	ewhitten_	ah ... not just me then ...
2005-02-21T09:18:00.000Z	ewhitten_	TreadingSoftly	 I didn't have this problem about a week ago.  that's what we get for checking stuff out then.
2005-02-21T09:18:00.000Z	ewhitten_	TreadingSoftly	 did it ever go down for you?
2005-02-21T09:20:00.000Z	TreadingSoftly	ewhitten_	well first it wouldn't autogen. .. fixed that by editing the script to use aclocal-1.9 and automake-1.9. But when it came to make it complained about being unable to find "assembly glib-sharp" for reasons I couldn't understand
2005-02-21T09:21:00.000Z	TreadingSoftly	ewhitten_	i think i need to give up until gtk-sharp2.0 has a proper Ubuntu package... this is entirely beyond my skill :(
2005-02-21T09:21:00.000Z	ewhitten_	TreadingSoftly	 I had some issues with that earlier as well. Had to hunt for glib-sharp.dll and gacutil -i it.
2005-02-21T09:21:00.000Z	TreadingSoftly	ewhitten_	gacutil -i does what?
2005-02-21T09:23:00.000Z	TreadingSoftly	ewhitten_	so what exactly did you do with gacutil -i?
2005-02-21T09:23:00.000Z	ewhitten_	TreadingSoftly	 gacutil -i :  install a dll into the GAC.
2005-02-21T09:24:00.000Z	TreadingSoftly	ewhitten_	i see
2005-02-21T12:54:00.000Z	ewhitten_	TreadingSoftly	 the "export" command will push stuff to your environment
