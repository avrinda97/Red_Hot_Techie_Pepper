2006-06-15T07:23:00.000Z	N9URK		how do you typically start xorg in ubuntu?  Do you have to "startx" everytime?
2006-06-15T07:23:00.000Z	N9URK		ctl alt F7 doesn't do anything
2006-06-15T07:23:00.000Z	anto9us	N9URK	I find it best to restart gdm
2006-06-15T07:55:00.000Z	anto9us	N9URK	lspci will list it if it's a pci device
2006-06-15T07:57:00.000Z	N9URK	anto9us	inono: Thanks
2006-06-15T07:58:00.000Z	N9URK	anto9us	inono: It says that it is an nVidia corp: MCP51 and I don't see nvidia on https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsWiredNetworkCards
2006-06-15T07:58:00.000Z	anto9us	N9URK	look at ndiswrapper
2006-06-15T08:01:00.000Z	anto9us	N9URK	it allows you to use your windows drivers for linux, I'm off shortly, can't talk you through it
2006-06-15T08:02:00.000Z	anto9us	N9URK	it's in the main repository I think
2006-06-15T08:03:00.000Z	N9URK	anto9us	would you think it is on the install CD?
2006-06-15T08:03:00.000Z	anto9us	N9URK	easy way to find out :)
2006-06-15T08:05:00.000Z	anto9us	N9URK	well, to be honest, I only pretend to
2006-06-15T08:06:00.000Z	anto9us	N9URK	it's not difficult to install ubuntu-desktop on a server install, once you're networked that is
2006-06-15T08:07:00.000Z	N9URK	anto9us	I will see if I can figure out ndiswrapper and get the card going
2006-06-15T08:07:00.000Z	anto9us	N9URK	it may be worth getting a compatible NIC, they're really cheap secondhand
2006-06-15T08:07:00.000Z	anto9us	N9URK	they're cheap new in fact
2006-06-15T08:08:00.000Z	anto9us	N9URK	sounds like a plan
2006-06-15T08:12:00.000Z	N9URK	anto9us	good night
2006-06-15T08:12:00.000Z	N9URK	anto9us	thanks for the help
