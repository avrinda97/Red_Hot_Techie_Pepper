2006-09-25T11:03:00.000Z	DrZeus		yeah, I found out a couple of days a go.  I wanted to see if someone knew anything about it
2006-09-25T11:03:00.000Z	DrZeus		seems to be is dead
2006-09-25T11:03:00.000Z	ArrenLex	DrZeus	what is dead?
2006-09-25T11:04:00.000Z	DrZeus	ArrenLex	a CAD software called LinuxCAd
2006-09-25T11:04:00.000Z	ArrenLex	DrZeus	if you're looking for an autocad replacement for Linux, you're out of luck. I myself have looked deeply for such an application a year or so ago. The best I could come up with was pycad.
2006-09-25T11:06:00.000Z	DrZeus	ArrenLex	then you at least tried and/or seen linuxcad right?
2006-10-14T12:42:00.000Z	ArrenLex	DrZeus	export VARIABLE=value
2006-10-14T12:43:00.000Z	ArrenLex	DrZeus	I assume netbeans has some kind of conf file, which is a better thing to use?
2006-10-14T12:46:00.000Z	DrZeus	ArrenLex	it has a .bin file
2006-10-14T12:47:00.000Z	DrZeus	ArrenLex	mnepton: thnx guys, now it is installing
2006-10-14T12:47:00.000Z	ArrenLex	DrZeus	what has a bin file?
2006-10-14T12:48:00.000Z	DrZeus	ArrenLex	i think it is some kind of binary
2006-10-14T12:49:00.000Z	ArrenLex	DrZeus	yes, but what are you talking about?
2006-10-14T12:51:00.000Z	DrZeus	ArrenLex	why do we have to chmod 755 the .bin files?
2006-10-14T12:51:00.000Z	ArrenLex	DrZeus	If I had any idea what permissions 755 represented I would tell you. I only have 000 and 777 memorised. =P
2006-10-14T12:52:00.000Z	ArrenLex	DrZeus	you need execute permissions to execute a file. Any file, be it shell script or binary executable.
2006-10-14T12:53:00.000Z	ArrenLex	DrZeus	of course not! That's a huge security risk. Imagine if someone just sent you a script which consisted of "rm -rf /". What would happen if any n00b user could just run it?!
2006-10-14T12:54:00.000Z	DrZeus	ArrenLex	oh, I see
2006-10-14T13:26:00.000Z	DrZeus	ArrenLex	now i have netbeans running
