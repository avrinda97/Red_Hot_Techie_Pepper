2010-07-17T11:15:00.000Z	terBot		how do i uninstall an older version of an application (package) on my PC
2010-07-17T11:16:00.000Z	terBot		running ubuntu 10.04 (lucid)
2010-07-17T11:17:00.000Z	Vig	terBot	There are a few ways, are you using Terminal, Synaptic Package manger or something like that?
2010-07-17T11:17:00.000Z	terBot	Vig	I don't mind which ever
2010-07-17T11:18:00.000Z	terBot	Vig	with synaptic, it shows me only the version of the package that i got from a repository
2010-07-17T11:18:00.000Z	terBot	Vig	however, i installed more recent versions via dpkg
2010-07-17T11:18:00.000Z	terBot	Vig	so i don't think synaptic can help on this
2010-07-17T11:18:00.000Z	Vig	terBot	Here is the Debian page on that: http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/doc/debian/ch-dpkg.html
2010-07-17T11:19:00.000Z	terBot	Vig	thanks.. will have a look
2010-07-17T11:19:00.000Z	Vig	terBot	And yes, the GUIs may leave crud behind, CLI with dpkg is one of the surest ways.
2010-07-17T11:21:00.000Z	terBot	Vig	i fear that using the -r switch will remove all versions of the app
2010-07-17T11:21:00.000Z	terBot	Vig	are you aware if this is the case?
2010-07-17T11:22:00.000Z	terBot	Vig	I've got three versions.. and i actually wanna remove just one - the oldest
2010-07-17T11:22:00.000Z	Vig	terBot	No, read section 16.5, but also I always make a backup , just in case.
2010-07-17T11:23:00.000Z	Vig		terBotL Often times it is cleaner to remove/purge all, then install/fetch the one that you wish, keeps the kernel cleaner also.
2010-07-17T11:25:00.000Z	Vig	terBot	Ever tried BleachBit, Sweeper or Computer Janitor?
2010-07-17T11:25:00.000Z	terBot	Vig	thanks... i'm in the middle of development.. and its a netbeans IDE that i'm trying to uninstall.. can't take chances now.. cos it might cost me some time.. to set everything back up.. will try later then
2010-07-17T11:25:00.000Z	terBot	Vig	not yet. . will have a look
2010-07-17T11:27:00.000Z	Vig	terBot	I know Computer Janitor is a pretty hefty and clean GUI pkg cleaner/maintainer, is installed on a default system, give that a run, or go Synaptic and find Old/Broken, that is ine Sections area, bottom Left.
