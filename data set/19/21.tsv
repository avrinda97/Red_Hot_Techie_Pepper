2004-09-13T16:05:00.000Z	jdub		it's just using /dev/ttyUSB0
2004-09-13T16:05:00.000Z	jdub		i was thinking
2004-09-13T16:05:00.000Z	jdub		what might be biting you is udev
2004-09-13T16:05:00.000Z	jdub		and hotpluggy things
2004-09-13T16:05:00.000Z	jdub		where the device name isn't there by the time gnome-pilot wants it or something
2004-09-13T16:05:00.000Z	jdub		pipka doesn't use udev or anything yet
2004-09-13T16:06:00.000Z	jdub		the person to ask about these things is jpr on gimpnet
2004-09-13T16:06:00.000Z	jdub		the weird thing about the pilot is that the device is really only there when you press the connect butto
2004-09-13T16:07:00.000Z	jdub		which sucks arse
2004-09-13T16:07:00.000Z	jdub		and unavoidable afaics
2004-09-13T16:08:00.000Z	lamont__	jdub	what rate is she using on ttyUSB0?
2004-09-13T16:42:00.000Z	lamont__	jdub	gimpnet == irc.wht?
2004-09-13T16:42:00.000Z	jdub	lamont__	irc.gimp.org or irc.gnome.org
2004-09-13T16:42:00.000Z	jdub	lamont__	he's away now though
2004-09-13T16:43:00.000Z	jdub	lamont__	based in boston
2004-09-13T16:50:00.000Z	lamont__	jdub	when is a good time to catch him?
2004-09-13T16:50:00.000Z	jdub	lamont__	hrm, a few hours ago
2004-09-13T16:50:00.000Z	jdub	lamont__	i don't really know :)
2004-09-13T10:53:00.000Z	lamont__	jdub	all of the syncs are now manual...
