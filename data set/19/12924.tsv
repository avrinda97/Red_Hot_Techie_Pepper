2005-06-14T08:48:00.000Z	justin	gjorans_	look at the other consoles
2005-06-14T08:49:00.000Z	gjorans_	justin	yes. thats where I checked that the computer got ip.
2005-06-14T08:49:00.000Z	gjorans_		it stops after generating locales.
2005-06-14T08:49:00.000Z	gjorans_		Generation complete. and then it stopes
2005-06-14T08:49:00.000Z	justin	gjorans_	use the console with the shell and run ps to see what it is doing
2005-06-14T08:49:00.000Z	gjorans_		no errormsg or anything.
2005-06-14T08:50:00.000Z	gjorans_		could it be apt-setup?
2005-06-14T08:50:00.000Z	gjorans_		it is a lot of prosesses
2005-06-14T08:51:00.000Z	gjorans_	justin	apt-cdrom is allso running
2005-06-14T08:51:00.000Z	justin	gjorans_	you can always try killing it, or just try conrol-c on the main console
2005-06-14T08:52:00.000Z	gjorans_		it doesnt do anything when I do ctrl-c
2005-06-14T08:52:00.000Z	gjorans_		but I will try to kill it
2005-06-14T08:53:00.000Z	gjorans_		it say no such prosess even though ps shows them when I try to kill the PID.
2005-06-14T08:54:00.000Z	gjorans_	justin	sorry. it errored when I killed them and could try it manualy and then go on :) thanx. that bought me out of the loop
