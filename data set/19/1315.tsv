2012-10-23T14:04:00.000Z	Lachezar		I have no Spell Check in LibreOffice. LibreOffice has Hunspell module, but Bulgarian has Aspell dictionary only.
2012-10-23T14:04:00.000Z	bin_bash	Lachezar	did you consider installing an English dictionary?
2012-10-23T14:05:00.000Z	Lachezar	bin_bash	why would I need English dictionary? I need Bulgarian dictionary?
2012-10-23T14:05:00.000Z	bin_bash	Lachezar	did you try installing a Bulgarian one then?
2012-10-23T14:06:00.000Z	Lachezar	bin_bash	There is only Aspell Bulgarian dictionary, Hunspell dictionary is not available.
2012-10-23T14:06:00.000Z	bin_bash	Lachezar	write one :)
2012-10-23T14:06:00.000Z	Lachezar	bin_bash	Not funny at all.
2012-10-23T14:06:00.000Z	bin_bash	Lachezar	if hunspell doesn't have a Bulgarian dictionary there's nothing we can do about it
2012-10-23T14:07:00.000Z	Lachezar	bin_bash	Hmmm... That's not how I see things: I *USED* to have spell check... Now I don't...
2012-10-23T14:08:00.000Z	bin_bash	Lachezar	you did you try installing a hunspell bulgarian dict?
2012-10-23T14:08:00.000Z	Lachezar	bin_bash	Are you a BOT?
2012-10-23T14:08:00.000Z	Lachezar	bin_bash	Right... A bot... Damn.
2012-10-23T14:08:00.000Z	bin_bash	Lachezar	I'm not a bot
2012-10-23T14:08:00.000Z	Lachezar	bin_bash	You certainly behave like one... Asking the same quesiton over and over again.
2012-10-23T14:10:00.000Z	bin_bash	Lachezar	I only asked the same question thrice because it's thus been unanswered
2012-10-23T14:11:00.000Z	Lachezar	bin_bash	At what point 'There is NO such package' is not an answer?
2012-10-23T14:11:00.000Z	bin_bash	Lachezar	if there is no such package, then how is it you had it before? You're not being concise.
2012-10-23T14:12:00.000Z	Lachezar	bin_bash	I've had spell-check, I do not know what package provided it, I am not sure it was Hunspell.
2012-10-23T14:13:00.000Z	bin_bash	Lachezar	you're not paying attention to me: If there is no Bulgarian dictionary for Hunspell, THERE IS NOTHING WE CAN DO ABOUT IT.
