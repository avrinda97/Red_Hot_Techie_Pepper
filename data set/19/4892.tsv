2008-11-06T19:00:00.000Z	jrib	benedikt_	not familiar with that.  Does that mean you don't create a new user by doing 'adduser foo'?
2008-11-06T18:57:00.000Z	jrib	benedikt_	/etc/skel should work for any new user you create.  Is that what you want?
2008-11-06T18:57:00.000Z	benedikt_	jrib	i trtied to place the shortcuts in /etc/skel/Desktop but it didnt work
2008-11-06T18:58:00.000Z	jrib	benedikt_	"didn't work"?  Does that mean you created a new user and it did not have the shortcut you created in /etc/skel/Desktop on his Desktop?
2008-11-06T18:58:00.000Z	benedikt_	jrib	im not using PAM authentication
2008-11-06T19:00:00.000Z	benedikt_	jrib	im using kerberos authentication (with the help of likewise-open).
2008-11-06T19:03:00.000Z	jrib	benedikt_	right, so you really just want to know how, with that setup, a user's home directory is created (which I don't know)
2008-11-06T19:04:00.000Z	jrib	benedikt_	those get created automatically on login by xdg-user-dir
2008-11-06T19:04:00.000Z	benedikt_	jrib	thats what im looking for
2008-11-06T19:04:00.000Z	jrib	benedikt_	your users don't end up with Examples in their ~?
2008-11-06T19:04:00.000Z	jrib	benedikt_	but that will only let you created directories, not stuff inside them
2008-11-06T19:05:00.000Z	jrib	benedikt_	see ~/.config/user-dirs.dirs and /etc/xdg/user-dirs.* though
2008-11-06T19:06:00.000Z	benedikt_	jrib	they get Examples yes
2008-11-06T19:07:00.000Z	jrib	benedikt_	don't know then, you have to find someone familiar with your setup (just repeat and mention the setup)
2008-11-06T19:07:00.000Z	benedikt_	jrib	i think im close to figuring this out
2008-11-06T19:16:00.000Z	benedikt_	jrib	i think i found it with xdg-desktop-icon
2008-11-06T19:17:00.000Z	jrib	benedikt_	cool, didn't know about that
2008-11-06T19:17:00.000Z	benedikt_	jrib	me neither.. found it thanks to you.
2008-11-06T19:29:00.000Z	jrib	benedikt_	ikonia: there has to be a way to mount smb shares as a user since you can do it in nautilus no?
