2004-12-15T16:36:00.000Z	flz		the thing is because i'm totally new to this i don't know how to go about changing anything yet.... the more i play i suppose the easier it will get
2004-12-15T16:37:00.000Z	flz		ok... installed ubuntu.. .no probs.. played with getting mp3/xvid/quictime etc to work
2004-12-15T16:38:00.000Z	flz		last time i rebooted it let me log on- user / password.... (it even made the noise) started to load gnome (at least i think it was gnome)
2004-12-15T16:38:00.000Z	flz		yeah typing / reading at same time
2004-12-15T16:39:00.000Z	flz		then no desktop icons/ no taskbar icons / no mose events doing anything
2004-12-15T16:39:00.000Z	flz		mose = mouse
2004-12-15T16:40:00.000Z	flz		yeah

2004-12-15T16:43:00.000Z	Matt|	flz	i think you should do as Rattboi suggested; delete your settings
2004-12-15T16:43:00.000Z	flz		matt- how would i do that?
2004-12-15T16:43:00.000Z	Matt|	flz	you can remove or move the .gnome and .metacity directories in your home directory
