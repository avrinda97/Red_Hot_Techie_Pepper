2007-04-27T15:22:00.000Z	ph1zzle		I have what I hope is a well answered question or something that most of you know. I tried putting my 7.04 system into hibernate which is running 64 bit kernel on intel c0re 2 and when it reboots... well it won't reboot, I am often left with a initramfs shell and a statement saying something like /dev/disk/by-uuid/XXXXX-XXXXXX etc file not found, I have tried editing grub from the boot screen with root=/dev/sda1 root=/dev/sda2 etc (as I cannot remem
2007-04-27T15:22:00.000Z	ph1zzle		<ph1zzle> ber which partition root is on) but I still get the same error and am left at initramfs prompt
2007-04-27T15:22:00.000Z	ph1zzle		does anyone know what I might be able to do?
2007-04-27T15:23:00.000Z	boss-bcp	ph1zzle	Have you tried what this says? http://ralph.n3rds.net/index.php?/archives/175-Adding-a-new-partition-in-fstab-with-UUID.html
2007-04-27T15:23:00.000Z	boss-bcp	ph1zzle	(Simple Google search by the way)
2007-04-27T15:24:00.000Z	ph1zzle	boss-bcp	where or how do I specify that?
2007-04-27T15:25:00.000Z	boss-bcp	ph1zzle	Did you get a message from ubotu?
2007-04-27T15:25:00.000Z	ph1zzle	boss-bcp	 I did but I don't have a shell on that system at the moment
2007-04-27T15:26:00.000Z	ph1zzle	boss-bcp	I have the busybox only shell
2007-04-27T15:26:00.000Z	boss-bcp	ph1zzle	Okay, well, like I said, look into /boot/grub/menu.lst
2007-04-27T15:27:00.000Z	ph1zzle	boss-bcp	do you know of a way to edit from busy box, I just managed to mount my / partition from inside... um, chroot me thinks
2007-04-27T15:28:00.000Z	boss-bcp	ph1zzle	Try another LiveCD. Dump this conversation to a floppy if you can.
2007-04-27T15:29:00.000Z	ph1zzle	boss-bcp	I am on another computer atm so I may ask again while I do this
2007-04-27T15:32:00.000Z	ph1zzle	boss-bcp	I have rebooted a dozen times and I finally mounted / this time under another directory, I then inserted the wrong live cd and tried to reboot again, instead of booting from the wrong cd it booted up the main OS just fine
2007-04-27T15:35:00.000Z	boss-bcp	ph1zzle	So basically a billion wrongs make a right?
2007-04-27T15:35:00.000Z	ph1zzle	boss-bcp	could be
2007-04-27T15:36:00.000Z	ph1zzle	boss-bcp	I don't know why or how... and I was surprised to see it but I am gonna look over my grub menu and blk id now
2007-04-27T15:38:00.000Z	ph1zzle	boss-bcp	the right uuid was specified in menu.lst
2007-04-27T15:39:00.000Z	ph1zzle	boss-bcp	well I can ssh into my desktop at work from home now so I think I am gonna call it a day, thanks for your help
