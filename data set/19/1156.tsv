2012-03-18T07:59:00.000Z	chalcedony		http://pastebin.com/ug6X4p0u wylde this is the page in the rescue cd that we are on
2012-03-18T08:01:00.000Z	chalcedony		DOES anyone know if it will do damage to my disk or data to exit the ubuntu live cd at that page?
2012-03-18T08:02:00.000Z	escott	chalcedony	doubt it could damage anything as it hasn't even picked a root fs. what was it doing before that?
2012-03-18T08:32:00.000Z	escott	chalcedony	fyi there is an accessibility channel, if the problem was a11y related
2012-03-18T08:32:00.000Z	chalcedony	escott	i'm sorry what?
2012-03-18T08:34:00.000Z	escott	chalcedony	wasn't following your problem, but if it is accessibility related there is/was an accessibility channel #ubuntu-accessibility (it might be empty)
2012-03-18T08:37:00.000Z	chalcedony	escott	the problem is the human interface but thank you so much IRC is a text medium - the one thing we both have is text/graphics so it works better than lots of things
2012-11-11T08:40:00.000Z	escott	chalcedony	won't open... meaning what? what kind of attachments?
2012-11-11T08:47:00.000Z	chalcedony	escott	we both have Yahoo mail, he mails the laptop (my account) in order to print from open office .doc(s), but my Yahoo mail can't open them, it just sits here trying and apparently times out, i don't know how to see an error in Yahoo mail.
2012-11-11T08:48:00.000Z	escott	chalcedony	so you click on the attachment in yahoo and say "download" and what happens
2012-11-11T08:50:00.000Z	chalcedony	escott	the twirly circle thing shows for a while and vanishes. the attachment doesn't open.
2012-11-11T08:50:00.000Z	escott	chalcedony	sounds like a problem with your browser/yahoo
2012-11-11T08:51:00.000Z	chalcedony	escott	i didn't change anything on my side.
2012-11-11T08:52:00.000Z	chalcedony	escott	its something that happened with him changing ubuntu or new firefox
2012-11-11T08:57:00.000Z	escott	chalcedony	not sure what to tell you, and we would need more details about exactly how your husband is attaching his files
2012-11-11T08:57:00.000Z	chalcedony	escott	he clicks on attach in firefox
2012-11-11T08:58:00.000Z	escott	chalcedony	firefox works. if there is a problem then its with yahoo. it could be yahoo interacting with his firefox or your browser... but its on the yahoo side
2012-11-11T08:59:00.000Z	escott	chalcedony	you could look at the email source and see if the attachment body is missing. perhaps yahoo is failing to attach the file he uploads to the email so there is a reference to the attachment but no contents.
2012-11-11T09:01:00.000Z	escott	chalcedony	the only other thing i can think of would be is if the files he creates with libreoffice are subtly different and cannot be opened by your version of word, but in that case the file would download first
