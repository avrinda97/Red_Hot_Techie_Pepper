2009-01-29T19:13:00.000Z	Joker_-_	spring_morning	thx, guess it's a know issue
2009-01-29T19:14:00.000Z	spring_morning	Joker_-_	i hope it helps...im in the same boat (no sound) except i didnt update anything
2009-01-29T19:14:00.000Z	Joker_-_	spring_morning	most of the posts doesnt "cure" the problem... some say reboot a few times... others say it's hardware failure...
2009-01-29T19:15:00.000Z	spring_morning	Joker_-_	did you just do a normal update or did you update the kernel?
2009-01-29T19:15:00.000Z	Joker_-_	spring_morning	kernel too
2009-01-29T19:16:00.000Z	spring_morning	Joker_-_	i really have no idea but i remember when i was googling, almost always people had lost sound b/c they updated the kernel..idk the solution, just that it appears to be common
2009-01-29T19:18:00.000Z	Joker_-_	spring_morning	Ill check it out later, gotta go to work. thx!
