2006-09-10T11:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	luisbg	 now ya know why i heep /home on a saperate partition, and do clean reinstalls
2006-09-10T11:34:00.000Z	luisbg	Dr_Willis	I do that too... but it is a pain in the ass to reinstall
2006-09-10T11:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	luisbg	 checked out the !alsa factoid and forum/wiki pages yet?
2006-09-10T11:35:00.000Z	luisbg	Dr_Willis	what pages?
2006-09-10T11:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	luisbg	 the "  !alsa " pages. :P
2006-09-10T11:36:00.000Z	luisbg	Dr_Willis	checked those, no help
2006-09-10T11:37:00.000Z	luisbg	Dr_Willis	those pages are for when alsa sees the card but doesn't work well, in my case alsa sees no card
2006-09-10T11:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	luisbg	 no idea then. I got a Nice creative sound card thats been no hassle.
2006-09-10T11:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	luisbg	 sounds like you may need toload the modules by hand
2006-09-10T11:37:00.000Z	luisbg	Dr_Willis	mine has been no hastle too until today, after 2 years
2006-09-10T11:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	luisbg	 does lspci see the card?
2006-09-10T11:37:00.000Z	luisbg	Dr_Willis	lspci sees the card
2006-09-10T11:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	luisbg	 thats a good sign then.
2006-09-10T11:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	luisbg	 could try the live cd// see if it sees the card. and works .and if so.  check what modules its loading
2006-09-10T11:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	luisbg	 done that many a time :P
2006-09-10T11:40:00.000Z	luisbg	Dr_Willis	ubuntu worked perfectly with my sound card for a long long time, just screwed up after the upgrade
2006-09-10T11:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	luisbg	 yep. i recall seeing a lot of peopel with that issue when dapper first came out.
2006-09-10T11:41:00.000Z	luisbg	Dr_Willis	do you recall a solution LOL, can I use oss instead of alsa?
