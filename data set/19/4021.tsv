2010-08-23T22:37:00.000Z	wyn	cached	if your going to try and insult me please try harder
2010-08-23T22:40:00.000Z	cached	wyn	i wasn't trying to insult you. i was pointing out that, despite your claims, you know what Windows is, and if you wish to play along as though you don't know what it is, say "I have windows in my wall..." instead of "I have Windows in my wall..."
2010-08-23T22:42:00.000Z	wyn	cached	you mean when I am referring to Windows and making a pun (or play) on the words , in that context ? how is England these days btw ?
2010-08-23T22:50:00.000Z	wyn	cached	normally tar -cf backup.tar /usr/local/pgsql/data will do it
2010-08-23T22:50:00.000Z	cached	wyn	there is no /usr/local/pgsql
2010-08-23T22:50:00.000Z	wyn	cached	maybe a diffrent place on mine then yours , grep for it
2010-08-23T22:50:00.000Z	cached	wyn	grep for what? pgsql?
2010-08-23T22:51:00.000Z	wyn	cached	psql/data
2010-08-23T22:53:00.000Z	wyn	cached	on mine its here (checked lucid) /var/lib/postgresql/8.4/main
2010-08-23T22:53:00.000Z	wyn	cached	I was on another flavour on ssh, forgot it wasnt ubuntu : )
2010-08-23T22:54:00.000Z	cached	wyn	so if i backup /var/lib/postgresql/8.3/main i'm safe?
2010-08-23T22:55:00.000Z	wyn	cached	yes, though there are better ways to back it up which mean you can restore much faster if you need to make a clean install
2010-08-23T22:55:00.000Z	cached	wyn	i can't run the server, which is why i want to make a clean install
2010-08-23T22:55:00.000Z	wyn	cached	ouch : ( yeah back that folder up, then move it back on
2010-08-23T22:58:00.000Z	wyn	cached	best way is to backit up and make a clean same version install, move that daa folder out the way and cp over your backup, restart and do a pg_dump to rescue it
2010-08-23T22:59:00.000Z	wyn	cached	daa= data, not enough coffee : )
2010-08-23T22:59:00.000Z	cached	wyn	sounds like a plan =)
2010-08-23T23:00:00.000Z	wyn	cached	indeed : )
