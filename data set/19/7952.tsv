2007-05-28T09:05:00.000Z	Mikeh		fattay, strangely enough click "add to panel"
2007-05-28T09:05:00.000Z	Mikeh		and then drag the item off your panel into the window fattay
2007-05-28T09:07:00.000Z	Fattay	Mikeh	How do I move things around on the panel? Right now everythings bunched up....and how come it doesnt show my open windows in this panel?
2007-05-28T09:10:00.000Z	Mikeh		fattay, all the items you need are right there in the "add to panel" menu fattay
2007-05-28T09:10:00.000Z	Mikeh		fattay, one item is "window list" try that one
2007-05-28T09:12:00.000Z	Fattay		yes windows list is what i wanted
2007-05-28T09:12:00.000Z	Fattay		thanks Mikeh
2007-05-28T09:12:00.000Z	Fattay		One last question
2007-05-28T09:12:00.000Z	Mikeh		ok?
2007-05-28T09:13:00.000Z	Fattay	Mikeh	How can I make the panel larger....without making the text larger etc. Like in Windows XP you can make it bigger but nothing else changes, not the size of the stuff on the panel.
