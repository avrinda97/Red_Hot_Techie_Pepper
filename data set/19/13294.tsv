2005-04-20T15:34:00.000Z	penguin42		bah - mozilla is really mozilla-firefox
2005-04-20T15:34:00.000Z	ogra	penguin42	mozilla-browser is still there
2005-04-20T15:35:00.000Z	penguin42	ogra	Ah - ok
2005-04-20T15:36:00.000Z	ogra	penguin42	use "add remove applications" from applications->system tools
2005-04-20T15:36:00.000Z	penguin42	ogra	Oh what is that - yet another apt front end ?
2005-04-20T15:36:00.000Z	ogra	penguin42	a frontend to the apt frontend ;)
2005-04-20T15:37:00.000Z	penguin42	ogra	Haha
2005-04-21T05:52:00.000Z	ogra	penguin42	some
2005-04-21T05:52:00.000Z	penguin42	ogra	Ah good - its quite interesting seeing the repeated ones coming up - I've been on for probably ~4 hours now and I've lost count of the number of alsa queries!
2005-04-21T05:53:00.000Z	ogra	penguin42	thats the endless repetition....
2005-04-21T05:53:00.000Z	ogra	penguin42	alsa will always be on the list, as binary drivers or restricted formats will
2005-04-21T05:54:00.000Z	penguin42	ogra	Yeh - I'm surprised alsa hasn't got better; I always just stick with creative cards and it seems safe!
2005-04-21T05:55:00.000Z	ogra	penguin42	the alsa problems are something we hope to sort out with the hardware database data
2005-04-21T05:56:00.000Z	penguin42	ogra	ah ok
2005-04-21T05:56:00.000Z	ogra	penguin42	the trick with alsa in ubuntu is just to find the right module and load it...there is not much magic left :)
2005-04-21T05:56:00.000Z	penguin42	ogra	Hey for me the autodetect worked
2005-04-21T05:57:00.000Z	ogra	penguin42	for most people it works...but there are still enough where it doesnt
2005-04-21T05:58:00.000Z	penguin42	ogra	and keeping upto date on those is a royal pain - its a pity that the kernel can't autogenerate a PCI-ID list for drivers
2005-04-21T05:58:00.000Z	ogra	penguin42	it actually hs one
