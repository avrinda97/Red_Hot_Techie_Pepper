2006-03-29T15:11:00.000Z	ompaul		https://wiki.ubuntu.com/InternetRelayChat  <-- list of all channels no art channel so go with that one

2006-03-29T12:01:00.000Z	reflect	ompaul	if you're just going to use it, who cares?
2006-03-29T12:03:00.000Z	ompaul	reflect	I would say that 12/15 mins is not bad - you want people who might be not reading the screen to go again
2006-03-29T12:04:00.000Z	reflect	ompaul	appreciated.
2006-03-29T12:06:00.000Z	ompaul	reflect	the logic is this, not only that there are new people, but if someone is not looking then 12/15 mins kinda allows the readers change
2006-03-29T12:07:00.000Z	reflect	ompaul	yeah, I'm sticking with your advice there.. this channel is too big to know who's new and who isn't (seeing as I'm new here)
2006-03-29T12:07:00.000Z	ompaul	reflect	did you ask a question?
2006-03-29T12:09:00.000Z	ompaul	reflect	did you actually look at the https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI ?
2006-03-29T12:11:00.000Z	reflect	ompaul	yes, I did look there, I've been following it for 3 revisions of the the ATI driver release now
2006-03-29T12:12:00.000Z	ompaul	reflect	okay so I have this idea that you need to run the graphics with 32bit because of a lack of drivers that work at 64 but I could be wrong so you might want to look at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebootstrapChroot don't  know if it can be done some other way - is there a 64bit graphics driver?
2006-03-29T12:12:00.000Z	reflect	ompaul	I followed this guide http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=423589 that also has instructions for AMD64
2006-03-29T12:13:00.000Z	reflect	ompaul	yeah, they distribute pure 64bit drivers.. and many reports that it works fine, I'd love to find one and compare my settings with theirs.
2006-03-29T12:13:00.000Z	ompaul	reflect	so request on the mailing list or forums
