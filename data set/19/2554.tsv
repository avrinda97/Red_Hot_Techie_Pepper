2010-06-28T23:08:00.000Z	DarkStar1		Juken: I had the same problem a while back
2010-06-28T23:08:00.000Z	juken	DarkStar1	able to resolve?
2010-06-28T23:09:00.000Z	DarkStar1	juken	Yeah. I found out by accident that the wrong hardware was selected
2010-06-28T23:09:00.000Z	juken	DarkStar1	in the sound preferences?
2010-06-28T23:09:00.000Z	DarkStar1	juken	 yeah
2010-06-28T23:10:00.000Z	juken	DarkStar1	http://i.imgur.com/DOHM7.png look right?
2010-06-28T23:11:00.000Z	DarkStar1	juken	thehardware tab
2010-06-28T23:12:00.000Z	juken	DarkStar1	http://i.imgur.com/OEl2w.png # how about that
2010-06-28T23:13:00.000Z	DarkStar1	juken	Yes. try one of those options then check your input tab as some normally have more than one input device
2010-06-28T23:13:00.000Z	juken	DarkStar1	aye, I have selected each of those, and gone to the input tab, and tried to talk, unfortunatley the LX-3000 which is what it's supposed to be, isn't working.
2010-06-28T23:14:00.000Z	DarkStar1	juken	Like the last one. Though I had a friend on a skype connection to test it with. because some combos disable one or both of your sound devices :)
2010-06-28T23:16:00.000Z	juken	DarkStar1	it's ridiculous that this isn't working, you select the device you want to use and it doesn't fucking work. =/
2010-06-28T23:17:00.000Z	juken	DarkStar1	here is a bug report where someone said they had to reinstall to get it working and it's been marked as solved, it's not solved, a reinstall doesn't count as a bug fix: https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+question/110234
2010-06-28T23:17:00.000Z	DarkStar1	juken	I know I was a bit pissed off My speakers were working but not my mic so I went into that panel and started fumbling around
2010-06-28T23:18:00.000Z	juken	DarkStar1	aye, I've been fumbling for a few days now =/
2010-06-28T23:18:00.000Z	DarkStar1	juken	also under the hardware tab. remember to change the profile
2010-06-28T23:18:00.000Z	DarkStar1	juken	I noticed yours is listed as hdmi
2010-06-28T23:19:00.000Z	juken	DarkStar1	yea, that one isn't my input or output, the headset I'm using is the one on the bottom
