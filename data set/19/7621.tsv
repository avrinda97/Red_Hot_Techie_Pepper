2007-07-24T14:05:00.000Z	DBO	Kaitlyn	also not that you can nest one within the other, which is why there are two ways to do it
2007-07-24T14:07:00.000Z	DBO	Kaitlyn	cat * | grep
2007-07-24T14:08:00.000Z	Kaitlyn	DBO	I don't follow that...
2007-07-24T14:08:00.000Z	DBO	Kaitlyn	does it get run every day?
2007-07-24T14:09:00.000Z	Kaitlyn	DBO	yes
2007-07-24T14:09:00.000Z	DBO	Kaitlyn	cat /etc/cron.daily/* | grep SOME_BIT_OF_THE_COMMAND
2007-07-24T14:09:00.000Z	DBO	Kaitlyn	erm... actually I forgot... that wont print the name of the file too...
2007-07-24T14:11:00.000Z	Kaitlyn	DBO	hmm.. I don't remmeber doing anything to get into the cron editor :(... just something like crontab... lol
2007-07-24T14:12:00.000Z	DBO	Kaitlyn	did you add it with a GUI tool?
2007-07-24T14:15:00.000Z	Kaitlyn	DBO	no.. i had the text editor
2007-07-24T14:16:00.000Z	DBO	Kaitlyn	you can quickly search through each file in there by doing "grep SEARCH_STRING /etc/cron.daily/*"
2007-07-24T14:17:00.000Z	DBO	Kaitlyn	have you search string be part of the command that gets run
2007-07-24T14:17:00.000Z	Kaitlyn	DBO	I did "grep svn /etc/cron.daily/*" and nothing
2007-07-24T14:18:00.000Z	DBO	Kaitlyn	do the same thing for /etc/cron.d/ see if you are calling a script not inside /etc/cron.daily
2007-07-24T14:19:00.000Z	DBO	Kaitlyn	agreed... why are you using crontab?
2007-07-24T14:20:00.000Z	DBO	Kaitlyn	you might want to look into using /etc/cron.daily and /etc/cron.d for this kind of thing in the future =)
2007-07-24T14:21:00.000Z	Kaitlyn	DBO	definitely :)
2007-07-24T14:32:00.000Z	Kaitlyn	DBO	alright, so how do I ago about executing /home/kaitlyn/Desktop/backup every night at 4am?
2007-07-24T14:33:00.000Z	DBO	Kaitlyn	cat out any one of the files in /etc/cron.d and you will get an idea
