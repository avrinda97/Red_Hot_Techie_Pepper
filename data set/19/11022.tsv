2009-10-21T09:44:00.000Z	JohnFlux		Hey all
2009-10-21T09:44:00.000Z	JohnFlux		how do I get skype to work in 9.04 ?
2009-10-21T09:46:00.000Z	JohnFlux		haha
2009-10-21T09:46:00.000Z	JohnFlux		I see lots of bug fixes go into 9.10, but why are none of these backported to 9.04 ?
2009-10-21T09:47:00.000Z	JohnFlux		is it just lack of manpower, or a design philisophy?
2009-10-21T09:47:00.000Z	_ubuntu_	JohnFlux	Karmic comes out in 9 days. Why waste time in backporting?
2009-10-21T09:48:00.000Z	JohnFlux		maybe I should just try upgrading to 9.10 now
2009-10-21T09:48:00.000Z	JohnFlux		is it in a good-enough state?
2009-10-21T09:49:00.000Z	_ubuntu_	JohnFlux	It works much better than 9.04 for me
2009-10-21T09:50:00.000Z	JohnFlux	Magnesium	there's still no RC ?  with 9 days to go?
2009-10-21T09:50:00.000Z	_ubuntu_	JohnFlux	My ethernet works again thanks to 9.10 :)
2009-10-21T09:50:00.000Z	JohnFlux	Magnesium	Isn't that cutting it kinda close?
2009-10-21T09:50:00.000Z	_ubuntu_		there's a chromium ppa
2009-10-21T09:50:00.000Z	_ubuntu_		nicl: there's a chromium ppa
2009-10-21T09:50:00.000Z	JohnFlux		nah no problem - I believe you
2009-10-21T09:51:00.000Z	JohnFlux		just seems a very short RC if it's only a few days
2009-10-21T09:51:00.000Z	_ubuntu_		nicl: and a official Google repository
2009-10-21T09:51:00.000Z	JohnFlux		the KDE release schedule leaves several months for an RC
2009-10-21T09:52:00.000Z	_ubuntu_	JohnFlux	the only thing that crashes for me is telepathy-butterfly
