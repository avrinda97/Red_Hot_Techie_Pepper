2008-01-11T04:45:00.000Z	esteveryt		nothing?
2008-01-11T04:45:00.000Z	esteveryt		none loves me
2008-01-11T04:45:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	esteveryt	First try   F6 then add noapic to the boot line.. also.. at what speed did you burn the iso?
2008-01-11T04:45:00.000Z	esteveryt	Jack_Sparrow	10x
2008-01-11T04:46:00.000Z	esteveryt	Jack_Sparrow	max speed for rw cd
2008-01-11T04:46:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	esteveryt	that should be slow enough..  May I assume you did the self test for errors
2008-01-11T04:46:00.000Z	esteveryt	Jack_Sparrow	which self test? the same that you have in the boot? yes i did. same error.. loading kernel .... ERROR I/O
2008-01-11T04:48:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	esteveryt	Some hardware, especially people with ati video cards have better luck with the alternate cd but try F6 at start or install and type noapic  just before the --
2008-01-11T04:50:00.000Z	esteveryt	Jack_Sparrow	ok i'm going to try noapic before the -- . i was thinking to download ubuntu feisty and then upgrade. i think that with feisty i should not have any problems.
2008-01-11T04:50:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	esteveryt	what hardware are you running.. I just did the f to g upgrade..ugh.. 6 hours
2008-01-11T04:53:00.000Z	esteveryt	Jack_Sparrow	nothing so strange.. intel 1500 mhz, 512mb ram, ati radeon 9600
2008-01-11T04:53:00.000Z	esteveryt	Jack_Sparrow	ati video card :| :|
2008-01-11T04:54:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	esteveryt	before you dl again... burn a copy at 4x
2008-01-11T04:54:00.000Z	esteveryt	Jack_Sparrow	i try : noapic , burn @ 4x & alternate cd. right?
2008-01-11T04:54:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	esteveryt	I had two Dells and an Hp laptop that would not touch it unless burned dead slow
2008-01-11T04:55:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	esteveryt	Try reburning the rw you have from the iso you have.. but very slow
2008-01-11T04:56:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	esteveryt	I'll be back in a few...
2008-01-11T05:02:00.000Z	esteveryt	Jack_Sparrow	i'm going to sell drugs while it's burning
