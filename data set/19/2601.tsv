2010-02-20T20:06:00.000Z	strawdonkey		Hello everyone. I was looking for a little advice on installing Ubuntu on an IDE Flash Module, and sizings and such
2010-02-20T20:06:00.000Z	nasso_	strawdonkey	partitionsizing?
2010-02-20T20:07:00.000Z	strawdonkey	nasso_	Well, I want to install Ubuntu on an IDE Flash module, but I need to buy one that is an appropriate size. I will be booting from the IDE Flash Module and storing data on a HDD.
2010-02-20T20:08:00.000Z	strawdonkey	nasso_	The thing I'm wondering is, I want to buy the smallest one possible, as they're expensive! If I could install it on a 1GB one that'd be great, but I can't find any info on what is a suitable size for installation
2010-02-20T20:09:00.000Z	nasso_	strawdonkey	system requirements is 4b
2010-02-20T20:09:00.000Z	nasso_	strawdonkey	i just did a clean install in a vm of ubuntu 9.10. will check its size
2010-02-20T20:09:00.000Z	strawdonkey	nasso_	Thank you
2010-02-20T20:14:00.000Z	nasso_	strawdonkey	/ uses 2,6gb and /boot uses 64
2010-02-20T20:15:00.000Z	strawdonkey	nasso_	Would there be a way to cut that down to, say, 2GB?
2010-02-20T20:15:00.000Z	nasso_	strawdonkey	no
2010-02-20T20:15:00.000Z	nasso_	strawdonkey	you would have to create an custom install using the server-installation cd
2010-02-20T20:16:00.000Z	nasso_	strawdonkey	or maybe xubuntu?
2010-02-20T20:16:00.000Z	strawdonkey	nasso_	I tried Xubuntu, it seemed unreliable; I think it has something to do with VIA chipsets, or maybe I installed it wrong ;)
2010-02-20T20:16:00.000Z	nasso_	strawdonkey	the installcd creates an 2,6 gb installation. nothing you can do about that without doing a custom installation
2010-02-20T20:16:00.000Z	strawdonkey	nasso_	Either way, after a weekend of messing around, I installed plain Ubuntu and everything worked great, so I don't really fancy the Xubuntu experience again just yet.
2010-02-20T20:17:00.000Z	strawdonkey	nasso_	Is there a guide or at least a starter on the web for how to do a custom installation?
2010-02-20T20:20:00.000Z	nasso_	strawdonkey	i dont know of any but look here: http://www.google.se/search?source=ig&hl=sv&rlz=&=&q=ubuntu+minimal+installation&btnG=Google-s√∂kning&meta=lr%3D&aq=f&oq=
2010-02-20T20:20:00.000Z	strawdonkey	nasso_	Excellent, thank you. I will go away and digest :)
2010-02-20T20:21:00.000Z	nasso_	strawdonkey	good luck. try out the installation in virtualbox first so you know how big installation you end up with!
