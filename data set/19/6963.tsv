2007-11-02T07:37:00.000Z	skycloud		can somebody tell me how i can fix this problem? whenever i boot linux the cpu fan stops, currently i'm trying to install and it keep crashing because it overheats.
2007-11-02T07:38:00.000Z	Ebiggs	skycloud	can you control the fan in the BIOS?
2007-11-02T07:39:00.000Z	skycloud	Ebiggs	no i don't think i can. i read on the forum i have to add something to boot/grub/menu.lst something like acpi
2007-11-02T07:39:00.000Z	skycloud	Ebiggs	 im using a emachine t2042
2007-11-02T07:39:00.000Z	skycloud	Ebiggs	im on the verge of crashing i think
2007-11-02T07:40:00.000Z	Ebiggs	skycloud	Sorry, thats over my head.
2007-11-02T07:41:00.000Z	Ebiggs	skycloud	In the grub menu, can you hit e and add that line before you boot?
2007-11-02T07:42:00.000Z	skycloud	Ebiggs	im booting from the livecd
2007-11-02T07:43:00.000Z	Ebiggs	skycloud	Oh, in that case can you hit F6 (other options) at the livecd menu and add it?
2007-11-02T07:43:00.000Z	skycloud	Ebiggs	oh ok cool thanks
2007-11-02T07:43:00.000Z	skycloud	Ebiggs	i'm going to try that
2007-11-02T07:44:00.000Z	Ebiggs	skycloud	No guarantees, but its worth a shot.  I'm learning things as I go around here.
2007-11-02T07:44:00.000Z	skycloud	Ebiggs	alright be back soon hopefully
2007-11-02T07:54:00.000Z	skycloud	Ebiggs	hey i
2007-11-02T07:55:00.000Z	skycloud	Ebiggs	i'm back, you fixed my problem. thanks so much now I just have to install and I wont have to deal with crashes anymore hopefully!
2007-11-02T07:55:00.000Z	Ebiggs	skycloud	Glad I could help! =D
2007-11-02T07:56:00.000Z	Ebiggs	skycloud	You may have to add that line to grub later, I don't know if it will automatically do that once it installs.
2007-11-02T07:57:00.000Z	skycloud	Ebiggs	yeah i know. i just have to do this command once i've installed. sudo gedit boot/grub/menu.lst
2007-11-02T07:57:00.000Z	skycloud	Ebiggs	but for now i can install without worrying anymore =)
