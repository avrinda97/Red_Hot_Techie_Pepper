2010-06-02T13:43:00.000Z	mooshe		would it be better to just run a full linux desktop
2010-06-02T13:44:00.000Z	mooshe		i was thinking of going with a light os in that case
2010-06-02T13:44:00.000Z	mooshe		i was thinking crunchbang but i dont know
2010-06-02T13:44:00.000Z	mooshe		which gui does it run
2010-06-02T13:46:00.000Z	mooshe		i dont feel like doing a lot of work
2010-06-02T13:46:00.000Z	mooshe		i guess i will put unr on my flash now
2010-06-02T13:46:00.000Z	mooshe		also the doc said something try with flash drive then use cd
2010-06-02T13:47:00.000Z	mooshe		but there is an option to install from flash right?
2010-06-02T13:47:00.000Z	mooshe		since i have no cd drive
2010-06-02T13:47:00.000Z	Galerien	mooshe	You can use wubi, but that's not a really clean instalation...
2010-06-02T13:50:00.000Z	Galerien	mooshe	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStick
2010-06-02T13:54:00.000Z	Galerien	mooshe	you know what a partition is, right?
2010-06-02T13:54:00.000Z	Galerien	mooshe	ok then :D
2010-06-02T14:03:00.000Z	Galerien	mooshe	no problem, just pay attention to what we give you, because I already gave you a link explaining how to install with a usbstick
2010-06-02T14:04:00.000Z	Galerien	mooshe	my ubuntu need 14 to 16 seconds to start...
2010-06-02T14:04:00.000Z	Galerien	mooshe	no problem, you just have to boot on you usbstick and chose "try ubuntu", that won't touch your hdd
2010-06-02T14:06:00.000Z	Galerien	mooshe	the live cd can install ubuntu or let you use ubuntu from the cd
2010-06-02T14:30:00.000Z	Galerien	mooshe	the live cd won't change anything
