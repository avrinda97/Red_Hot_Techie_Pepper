2007-06-30T08:38:00.000Z	lllllllllllll		OK, new question. Can somebody give me a program that will back up a whole partition to a larger HDD, without wiping the contents of said HDD?
2007-06-30T08:39:00.000Z	lllllllllllll		gparted allows you to copy partitions, but only by wiping whatever is on the receiving medium
2007-06-30T08:39:00.000Z	ali1234	lllllllllllll	use dd to make an image
2007-06-30T08:40:00.000Z	ali1234	lllllllllllll	man dd. but seriously, just google "dd backup image" or something
2007-06-30T08:41:00.000Z	ali1234	lllllllllllll	that should get you a page that will also explain how to access the resulting image without copying it back to the hd etc
2007-06-30T08:48:00.000Z	ali1234	lllllllllllll	some pages about dd and images: http://www.debianhelp.co.uk/ddcommand.htm and http://www.e-shell.org/index.py?code=tips-5
2007-06-30T09:09:00.000Z	ali1234	lllllllllllll	that dd command you wrote will fail because the output is a directory
2007-06-30T09:09:00.000Z	lllllllllllll	ali1234	and it needs to be able to write to its own partition?
2007-06-30T09:10:00.000Z	ali1234	lllllllllllll	you want "dd if=/dev/sda2 of=/media/External/sda2/fsimage" for example, then your backup will go to a file called "fsimage"
2007-06-30T09:11:00.000Z	ali1234	lllllllllllll	but that wont work cos you are writing back to the same partition by the looks of it
2007-06-30T09:12:00.000Z	lllllllllllll	ali1234	how about "dd if=/dev/sda2 of=/media/external/fsimage"? The resulting file, fsimage, wouldn't interfere with all the other data I have on External?/
2007-06-30T09:12:00.000Z	ali1234	lllllllllllll	yeah, it would go on your root partition
2007-06-30T09:13:00.000Z	ali1234	lllllllllllll	assuming it is big enough
2007-06-30T09:13:00.000Z	ali1234	lllllllllllll	if you output the dd to a file, no other file will be overwritten
2007-06-30T09:14:00.000Z	lllllllllllll	ali1234	nice, that's what I'm looking for. Thanks a lot
2007-06-30T09:14:00.000Z	ali1234	lllllllllllll	the thing about /dev/sda2 is, it is very similar to a file. you could use cp instead of dd for the same effect
2007-06-30T09:15:00.000Z	lllllllllllll	ali1234	the partition to be copied is my dual-boot of WinXP
2007-06-30T09:15:00.000Z	lllllllllllll	ali1234	so I was thinking it would need to be a complete clone of the original data
2007-06-30T09:16:00.000Z	ali1234	lllllllllllll	well, by copying the device, it will be. but the resulting file will be the same size as the disk you backup, unless you compress it
