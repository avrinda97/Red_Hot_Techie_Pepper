2007-01-01T17:12:00.000Z	cybercod		I'd power down, remove batteries, remove cmos battery (if you can get to it), and let it chill a little bit
2007-01-01T17:12:00.000Z	cybercod		then the bios may be in better shape
2007-01-01T17:13:00.000Z	cybercod		desktop motherboards usually have a jumper for bios reset... but i know nothing about tablets
2007-01-01T17:14:00.000Z	cybercod		you could google the model number and find some stuff..
2007-01-01T17:15:00.000Z	cybercod		well gentlemen, for those of you who remember my question earlier about reinstalling all packages...i am doing it now...
2007-01-01T17:17:00.000Z	cybercod		you can't disable it?
2007-01-01T17:19:00.000Z	cybercod		any luck on the cmos battery?
2007-01-01T17:20:00.000Z	cybercod		should be accessible... a small panel maybe?
2007-01-01T17:20:00.000Z	cybercod		good night samuel
2007-01-01T17:22:00.000Z	cybercod		you may be grabbing the wrong file... which file you selecting with ndiswapper?
2007-01-01T17:22:00.000Z	jame1	cybercod	official INF from manufacturer
2007-01-01T17:22:00.000Z	jame1	cybercod	but I did try to compile the ubuntu zd1211 driver... not sure if it's conflicting but then I disabled it via modprobe -r zd1211
2007-01-01T17:23:00.000Z	jame1	cybercod	yes but only for 9x, ME etc - i chose the provided XP one (only three/four files)
2007-01-01T17:23:00.000Z	jame1	cybercod	including .sys etc?
2007-01-01T17:24:00.000Z	jame1	cybercod	yeah i tried all three files, it only accepts .inf but maybe i should do it via terminal?
2007-01-01T17:25:00.000Z	jame1	cybercod	hm then do you think it's a conflicting ubuntu driver - the zd1211 one?
2007-01-01T17:30:00.000Z	jame1	cybercod	once i've added to the blacklist, how do i update/refresh?
2007-01-01T17:33:00.000Z	jame1	cybercod	any help please?
2007-01-01T17:33:00.000Z	jame1	cybercod	ok cheers
