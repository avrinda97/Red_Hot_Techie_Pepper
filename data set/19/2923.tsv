2009-11-24T17:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	munley	 check your fstab tobe sure its got the proper entry for the swap partition
2009-11-24T17:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	munley	 you may need to  alter your /etc/fstab file to mount  the partition, and enable swap properly
2009-11-24T17:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	munley	 check /etc/fstab
2009-11-24T17:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	munley	 your UUID for the swap may have changed.
2009-11-24T17:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	munley	 edit /etc/fstab   properly.
2009-11-24T17:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	munley	 and if you resize partitons some times the UUID can change.
2009-11-24T17:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	munley	 for the 5th time.. check your /etc/fstab entry for the swap partition. compare the UUID with what blkid says it should be
2009-11-24T17:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	munley	 look at the entry it has  for your swap partition. and the UUID # its using.
2009-11-24T17:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	munley	 from a terminal
2009-11-24T17:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	munley	 its not a command.. its what you do when you LOOK at the output of blkid and /etc/fstab
2009-11-24T17:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	munley	 first command to run is 'sudo blkid' find out what one is the swap partition.  and make note of its UUID=####### data
2009-11-24T17:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	munley	 looks similer to ->
2009-11-24T17:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	munley	 and my /etc/fstab has a similer line that looks like
2009-11-24T17:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	munley	 note the end of the line i pasted..   says 'swap' :)
2009-11-24T17:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	munley	 thats the one you want the info on.
2009-11-24T17:51:00.000Z	munley	Dr_Willis	SpaceGhost.....what do I do next?
