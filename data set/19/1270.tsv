2011-09-08T22:00:00.000Z	mang0		Is there a way to move these: http://img7.imagebanana.com/img/thfo0aos/Selection_009.png to the other side of the clock? They are the menu bar icons....
2011-09-08T22:02:00.000Z	masterchief	mang0	right click, move, I think?
2011-09-08T22:03:00.000Z	mang0	masterchief	I thought that too, but it's not an applet. I get the application menu; RMB - opera = Open new tab etc
2011-09-08T22:08:00.000Z	masterchief	mang0	I'm not sure then. I know it's like a notification area, but I'm not sure how to move it. It was easy in older editions, but I'm not sure now though.
2011-09-08T22:08:00.000Z	mang0	masterchief	Shame :<
2011-09-08T22:10:00.000Z	masterchief	mang0	have you asked the forums yet?
2011-09-08T22:10:00.000Z	masterchief	mang0	they can pretty help you out of anything and everything.
2011-09-08T22:10:00.000Z	mang0	masterchief	no, I though I'd come here first, as I had irc open. Then google, then forums :P
2011-09-08T22:11:00.000Z	masterchief	mang0	good priority list lol
2011-09-08T22:11:00.000Z	mang0	masterchief	hehe, it's always worked for me in the past ;)
2011-09-08T22:11:00.000Z	masterchief	mang0	how long have you been using Ubuntu?
2011-09-08T22:12:00.000Z	mang0	masterchief	About six months now, I think.
2011-09-08T22:12:00.000Z	mang0		:P
2011-09-08T22:12:00.000Z	masterchief	mang0	natty?
2011-09-08T22:15:00.000Z	mang0	masterchief	yeah :)
2011-09-08T22:16:00.000Z	masterchief	mang0	I just installed 10.04 last night... *sigh* I didn't realize that 10.04 wasn't the latest.
2011-09-08T22:16:00.000Z	mang0	masterchief	hehehe, you want 11.04 ;)
2011-09-08T22:19:00.000Z	masterchief	mang0	Mm... I'm not sure. I heard it from a friend that 10.04 is better. So... that's what I'm going to stick with.
2011-09-08T22:20:00.000Z	mang0	masterchief	How better?! imo 11.04 is nice :3. Also, you have the option for the new unity gui, or the old gnome gui. I use gnome cuz I don't like the unity one, but hey :)
