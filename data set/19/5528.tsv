2008-06-14T05:31:00.000Z	jayson_		Hello people, I have a 22" monitor and a 7100 GS. When i active the nvidia proprietary my monitor doesnot work. How can I fix that ?
2008-06-14T05:31:00.000Z	th1	jayson_	have you tried running nvidia-xconfig?
2008-06-14T05:34:00.000Z	th1	jayson_	what outputs do you have on your gfx card?
2008-06-14T05:34:00.000Z	th1	jayson_	if you got 2 slots then try the other one
2008-06-14T05:35:00.000Z	jayson_	th1	hardDisk, On vga out works fine, only in DVI that broke
2008-06-14T05:35:00.000Z	th1	jayson_	I'll paste my xconfig but it's like 6 months since I got it to work so I can't remember wtf I did
2008-06-14T05:35:00.000Z	jayson_	th1	Ok. i'm waiting

2008-06-14T05:37:00.000Z	jayson_	th1	Thanks I will try
2008-06-14T05:38:00.000Z	jayson_	th1	I will use only device things.
2008-06-14T05:44:00.000Z	th1	jayson_	can you update that pastebin with a description of your setup?
2008-06-14T05:44:00.000Z	jayson_	th1	Sorry I can't understand
2008-06-14T05:44:00.000Z	th1	jayson_	just describe your hardware and what you're trying to accomplish in a few paragraphs
2008-06-14T05:48:00.000Z	jayson_	th1	http://www.pastebin.org/43843 May i need try envy method ?
2008-06-14T05:49:00.000Z	th1	jayson_	wtf is envy method ;)
2008-06-14T05:50:00.000Z	th1	jayson_	just when you override edid like I do then you run the risk that hte card will output a signal your monitor can't grok. but modern displays should be able to handle that without damage, but *caveat emptor*
2008-06-14T05:51:00.000Z	jayson_	th1	With opensource driver my display have managed connections fine
2008-06-14T05:53:00.000Z	th1	jayson_	closed source is always trial and error :(
2008-06-14T07:23:00.000Z	jayson_	th1	HardDrive I have tried to reinstall ubuntu but don't work yet
