2007-10-30T06:32:00.000Z	sophtpaw		can someone advise me on what is the best way of updating one's repos on a fresh install?
2007-10-30T06:32:00.000Z	sophtpaw		!repos
2007-10-30T06:32:00.000Z	Flannel	sophtpaw	What do you mean updating?
2007-10-30T06:32:00.000Z	sophtpaw	Flannel	i got a fresh install and want to max my repos so i can get anything i want in future
2007-10-30T06:33:00.000Z	Flannel	sophtpaw	Youre pretty good as it is.  As of feisty universe was enabled by default.
2007-10-30T06:33:00.000Z	sophtpaw	Flannel	for non-free too?
2007-10-30T06:34:00.000Z	sophtpaw	Flannel	there are so many differnt ones arent there? universe, mulitiverse, non-free, commercial etc
2007-10-30T06:34:00.000Z	Flannel	sophtpaw	I'm not sure if multiverse is enabled by default.  If you go to 'software sources' (or software properties) in your admin menu, you'll see a set of four checkboxes for your normal repos.
2007-10-30T06:36:00.000Z	sophtpaw	Flannel	looks like everything was enabled... so, i'm good to go
2007-10-30T06:36:00.000Z	sophtpaw	Flannel	so java and flash etc is all in repos waiting for me to install?
2007-10-30T06:39:00.000Z	Flannel	sophtpaw	yep
