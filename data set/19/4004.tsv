2009-12-14T04:42:00.000Z	git__		it's cheaper to do RAID at hardware level
2009-12-14T04:43:00.000Z	arooni-mobile___	git__	is that to me?
2009-12-14T04:43:00.000Z	arooni-mobile___	git__	so you'd recommend doing hardware not software raid?
2009-12-14T04:44:00.000Z	arooni-mobile___	git__	in case a hard drive died?  i dont have a hardware raid controller currently ...
2009-12-14T04:44:00.000Z	arooni-mobile___	git__	that being said, my raid 1 software setup just died reallly relaly hard
2009-12-14T04:44:00.000Z	arooni-mobile___	git__	agree
2009-12-14T04:44:00.000Z	arooni-mobile___	git__	i had raid1 setup and now i cant even boot, and i've been trying ot debug for dayz!
2009-12-14T04:44:00.000Z	arooni-mobile___	git__	it already did die
2009-12-14T04:45:00.000Z	arooni-mobile___	git__	whats the best way to do this?  just start over and install to a particular drive?
2009-12-14T04:45:00.000Z	arooni-mobile___	git__	i'm worried because i installed raid before, that i wont be able to ovewrite it
2009-12-14T04:46:00.000Z	arooni-mobile___	git__	i have a backup in the cloud, plus i have a good copy of the data on one of the raid 1 drives
2009-12-14T04:47:00.000Z	arooni-mobile___	git__	essentially i have two identical 320GB drives ... one of which has my /home partition unscathed... not sure what to do now
2009-12-14T04:48:00.000Z	arooni-mobile___	git__	these two drives are PATA
2009-12-14T04:48:00.000Z	arooni-mobile___	git__	not sure if i should try to do hardware raid now, or wait until i buy a mobo with it in the future
2009-12-14T04:48:00.000Z	arooni-mobile___	git__	the drives before sata,  with IDE cables
2009-12-14T04:50:00.000Z	arooni-mobile___	git__	so should i PUNT on getting raid working for now?  i.e. can one setup hardware raid later?
2009-12-14T04:50:00.000Z	arooni-mobile___	git__	so i can setup raid1 via hardware controller later?
2009-12-14T04:51:00.000Z	arooni-mobile___	git__	sounds llike i'll do that
2009-12-14T04:51:00.000Z	arooni-mobile___	git__	so maybe i just dont need it till i build another box
