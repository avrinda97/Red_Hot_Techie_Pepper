2006-11-16T12:36:00.000Z	jamincollins		seems the bridge interface defaults to the highest MAC of all interfaces within it
2006-11-16T12:37:00.000Z	jamincollins		that is with eth0 and eth1 having ...:89 and ...:8A respectively, the bridge will have ...:8A
2006-11-16T12:38:00.000Z	jamincollins		which presents a problem when eth0 (...:89) is  a wireless interface
2006-11-16T12:39:00.000Z	minimec	jamincollins	Do you want to chage your mac adress?
2006-11-16T12:40:00.000Z	jamincollins	minimec	yes, I would like to alter the MAC of the bridge
2006-11-16T12:40:00.000Z	minimec	jamincollins	... which is a linux computer...
2006-11-16T12:40:00.000Z	jamincollins	minimec	correct Ubuntu 6.10 laptop, I'm attempting to bridge the wired and wireless
2006-11-16T12:41:00.000Z	minimec	jamincollins	 sudo ifconfig eth0 down hw ether 00:00:00:00:00:01 then sudo ifconfig eth0 up ... Look at your mac adress ;)
2006-11-16T12:42:00.000Z	jamincollins	minimec	those commands don't work against a bridge interface
2006-11-16T12:42:00.000Z	minimec	jamincollins	so I don't understand what you want ... sorry.
2006-11-16T12:43:00.000Z	jamincollins	minimec	a bridge is virtual interface combining multiple physical interfaces into one
2006-11-16T12:44:00.000Z	minimec	jamincollins	...and every physical interface must have a special mac adress ... Is that so?
2006-11-16T12:44:00.000Z	jamincollins	minimec	yes
2006-11-16T12:45:00.000Z	minimec	jamincollins	so writing a script that gives every interface this special mac adress win't work?
2006-11-16T12:46:00.000Z	jamincollins	minimec	not against the br0 (bridge) interface.... but you've given me an idea
2006-11-16T12:46:00.000Z	minimec	jamincollins	can't you fire up the whole network with /etc/network/interfaces?
2006-11-16T12:52:00.000Z	minimec	jamincollins	have a look at /etc/network/interfaces. This is the old debian way ;)
2006-11-16T12:52:00.000Z	jamincollins	minimec	I'm very familiar with that file... it won't do what I need...
2006-11-16T12:53:00.000Z	minimec	jamincollins	so I cannot help you ;)
