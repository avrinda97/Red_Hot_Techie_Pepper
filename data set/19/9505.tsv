2007-04-08T16:26:00.000Z	bobbob1016	noelferreira	I'm looking around, wait a second
2007-04-08T16:27:00.000Z	noelferreira		thanks bobbob1016. with vlc it is the same as totem. good sound and no image. with real player i have image but sound is very bad
2007-04-08T16:27:00.000Z	bobbob1016	noelferreira	it looks like these files aren't that easy to open, there are a few people in the forums that have similar problems
2007-04-08T16:28:00.000Z	noelferreira		can i convert it to avi bobbob1016?
2007-04-08T16:28:00.000Z	bobbob1016	noelferreira	try downloading the video posted here, and try it with totem, my totem just played it http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=390897&highlight=rmvb
2007-04-08T16:31:00.000Z	noelferreira	bobbob1016	i can't. i'm using amd64. maybe i need a codec that i don't have. maybe win32 codecs. i don't know
2007-04-08T16:32:00.000Z	bobbob1016	noelferreira	did you install the 64bit ubuntu, or the 32bit?
2007-04-08T16:32:00.000Z	noelferreira		64 bobbob1016
2007-04-08T16:33:00.000Z	bobbob1016	noelferreira	if you have 64 bit ubuntu, the win32codecs might not work, win32 = 32 bit I THINK, but the ways to install the 64 bit codecs are different
2007-04-08T16:33:00.000Z	bobbob1016	noelferreira	I don't know/use the 64 bit ubuntu, so I wouldn't be much help with that
2007-04-08T16:33:00.000Z	noelferreira		i guess there aren't win64 codecs bobbob1016
2007-04-08T16:34:00.000Z	bobbob1016	noelferreira	not yet, there are workarounds, but I don't know them
2007-04-08T16:34:00.000Z	noelferreira		ok
2007-04-08T16:34:00.000Z	noelferreira		thanks anyway
2007-04-08T16:35:00.000Z	noelferreira	bobbob1016	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=54399 do i need windows to try this?
