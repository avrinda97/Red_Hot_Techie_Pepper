2007-04-13T08:53:00.000Z	WNxCryptic		@xt: Averatec laptop, 7.04 ubuntu; LAN is completely unrecognized and (to my knowlege) a driver doesn't exist for it, so I'm trying to install a driver for the wireless card.
2007-04-13T08:53:00.000Z	xtknight	WNxCryptic	'completely' unrecognized?  does it detect it over the PCI bus?
2007-04-13T08:54:00.000Z	xtknight	WNxCryptic	pastebin "sudo lspci -vv"
2007-04-13T08:54:00.000Z	xtknight	WNxCryptic	well boot a livecd no the laptop
2007-04-13T08:55:00.000Z	xtknight	WNxCryptic	i would use 7.04
2007-04-13T08:55:00.000Z	xtknight	WNxCryptic	oh well that's good.  it loaded a driver.  you just need to learn how to use the wireless
2007-04-13T08:57:00.000Z	xtknight	WNxCryptic	ok dont give up.  it's probably something silly like being unassociated with an acces point.  verdict is, your driver has been loaded
2007-04-13T08:58:00.000Z	xtknight	WNxCryptic	hmm?
2007-04-13T08:58:00.000Z	xtknight	WNxCryptic	oh
