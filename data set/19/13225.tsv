2005-04-30T11:42:00.000Z	IIIEars		how do i find an installed program?
2005-04-30T11:42:00.000Z	crimsun	IIIEars	what do you mean, the binary or the package itself?
2005-05-03T12:58:00.000Z	crimsun	IIIEars	yes. Back up /etc/X11/xorg.conf and /etc/network/interfaces
2005-05-03T13:02:00.000Z	crimsun	IIIEars	handled by hotplug, which is a userspace util that pulls information from sysfs
2005-05-03T13:02:00.000Z	crimsun	IIIEars	where is what? :)
2005-05-03T13:03:00.000Z	crimsun	IIIEars	/sbin/hotplug uses scripts and configuration files in /etc/hotplug/
2005-05-03T13:05:00.000Z	crimsun	IIIEars	/sys/ :)
2005-05-19T12:22:00.000Z	crimsun	IIIEars	yes, it must be bad =)
2005-05-19T12:31:00.000Z	crimsun	IIIEars	reiser3 is mature finally
2005-06-11T13:46:00.000Z	IIIEars	crimsun	- Would love to have a copy if it isn't too much trouble. Please?
2005-06-11T13:46:00.000Z	crimsun	IIIEars	you lost me; a copy of what?
2005-06-13T06:20:00.000Z	IIIEars	crimsun	- spreads light.
2005-06-13T07:52:00.000Z	IIIEars	crimsun	- eject: unable to eject, last error: Invalid argument Has this ever happened to you?
2005-06-13T07:53:00.000Z	crimsun	IIIEars	yes, when gam_server (via nautilus?) is holding open fds on the device
2005-06-13T07:54:00.000Z	IIIEars	crimsun	- What is the next step?
2005-06-13T07:54:00.000Z	crimsun	IIIEars	after ensuring you have no windows/applications open that reference the device, I kill the process holding it open
2005-06-13T07:55:00.000Z	IIIEars	crimsun	- umount -f /dev/cdrom "device not mounted"
2005-06-13T07:55:00.000Z	IIIEars	crimsun	- You are a guru. - Thank You.
2005-07-27T09:48:00.000Z	IIIEars	crimsun	- lin# 97-98 in kritty's config file?
