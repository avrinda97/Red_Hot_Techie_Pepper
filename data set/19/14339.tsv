2010-09-30T06:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	DarkRedman	 it can be risky. Depends on the machine/mb/bios in place.
2010-09-30T06:56:00.000Z	DarkRedman		I've an AMIBIOS
2010-09-30T06:56:00.000Z	DarkRedman		with nvidia n750 chipset
2010-09-30T06:57:00.000Z	DarkRedman		Phenom II X4 2,5Ghz
2010-09-30T06:57:00.000Z	DarkRedman		4GB RAM
2010-09-30T06:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	DarkRedman	 check the amibios/bios update pages. and their readmes.   Many MB's these days have a 'rescue' type bios option. in case of a failed flash.. but ive not heard the original problem.
2010-09-30T06:57:00.000Z	DarkRedman		I can't burn a CD because I need LiveCD for that I've only one CD drive
2010-09-30T07:01:00.000Z	DarkRedman	darkdelusions	How to get help from canonical without paying for one year but just to fix the current bugs, I asked it since 5 days on channel but no one knows
2010-09-30T07:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	DarkRedman	 there was some option on the live cd i recall to boot 'to ram' and free up the optical drive..
