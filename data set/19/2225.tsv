2010-07-13T20:49:00.000Z	Njh		anyone know where i can get help on SCons
2010-07-13T20:50:00.000Z	tucemiux	Njh	what programming language do you use?
2010-07-13T20:50:00.000Z	Njh	tucemiux	im using c++, but using scons to compile them
2010-07-13T20:51:00.000Z	tucemiux	Njh	someone in the C++ channel might know about it
2010-07-13T20:51:00.000Z	Njh	tucemiux	what channel is that
2010-07-13T20:51:00.000Z	tucemiux	Njh	#c++
2010-07-13T20:51:00.000Z	tucemiux	Njh	##c++
2010-07-13T20:51:00.000Z	Njh	tucemiux	thanks
2010-07-13T20:52:00.000Z	tucemiux	Njh	do you work on open source appz?
2010-07-13T20:52:00.000Z	Njh	tucemiux	but its not a c++ problem, its a SCons problem
2010-07-13T20:53:00.000Z	tucemiux	Njh	yes I know, you want to talk to someone that actually uses scons, this is an ubuntu support channel, not a programming channel, most likely programmers will be able to help you out
2010-07-13T20:53:00.000Z	tucemiux	Njh	I believe #mixxx uses scons
2010-07-13T20:53:00.000Z	tucemiux	Njh	what question do you have about scons??
2010-07-13T20:53:00.000Z	Njh	tucemiux	ok, sry, thanks
2010-07-13T20:53:00.000Z	Njh	tucemiux	its about linking shared objects
2010-07-13T20:55:00.000Z	tucemiux	Njh	ahh sorry I only know how to install it, someone in ##c++ might be able to help you, i know for surely someone in #mixxx ***might*** be able to help you, they use scons and if youre interested im actually looking for a C++ mentor :-)
2010-07-13T20:56:00.000Z	Njh	tucemiux	i wish i could help you with that, but the funny thing is that im not actually programming the c++ stuff just building it right now, i only know c, python, and java
2010-07-13T20:58:00.000Z	tucemiux	Njh	ahh ok thanks either way,  if no one can help you in ##c++ ask in #mixxx later on tonight, mixxx is written in C++ and they use scons
2010-07-13T20:59:00.000Z	Njh	tucemiux	ok cool, thanks for the help
