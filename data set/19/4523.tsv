2011-06-25T23:52:00.000Z	thrillERboy		my conky is ugly :(
2011-06-25T23:52:00.000Z	dr_willis	thrillERboy	 theres a neat conky config on webupd8 this week.
2011-06-26T00:05:00.000Z	dr_willis	thrillERboy	 theres 1000;s of them. trying that circule one  from the webupd8 site right now
2011-06-26T00:06:00.000Z	dr_willis	thrillERboy	 conky only recently started using the new lua features.. so a lot of the old configs will be a lot simpiler to tweak.
2011-07-22T17:59:00.000Z	dr_willis	thrillERboy	 it is possible to mount the wubi disk file and access things in it. from a live cd.  i dont use or reccomend wubi at all.
2011-07-22T18:00:00.000Z	thrillERboy	dr_willis	I don't have a live cd now. I can I burn one now?
2011-07-22T18:01:00.000Z	dr_willis	thrillERboy	 you can make them with windows . yes.
2011-07-23T18:19:00.000Z	dr_willis	thrillERboy	 use the mount command as needed . :)
2011-07-23T18:22:00.000Z	thrillERboy	dr_willis	what should I give as mount point? sorry, me half n00b
2011-07-23T18:22:00.000Z	dr_willis	thrillERboy	 make a directory.. you mount to a directory
2011-07-23T18:23:00.000Z	dr_willis	thrillERboy	 thats how mount works...
2011-07-23T18:23:00.000Z	dr_willis	thrillERboy	 sudo mkdir /media/PICKANAME      then 'sudo mount /dev/whatever /media/PICKANAME' is the basics of it all
2011-08-02T17:24:00.000Z	dr_willis	thrillERboy	 you are not putting options after the last -- (if it exists) are you?
2012-04-28T10:34:00.000Z	dr_willis	thrillERboy	 i dont think wubi upgrades well
2012-04-28T10:34:00.000Z	thrillERboy	dr_willis	thanks, then I'd have to reinstall I guess
2012-04-28T10:35:00.000Z	dr_willis	thrillERboy	 i suggest not using wubi... ever... ;)
2012-04-28T10:35:00.000Z	thrillERboy	dr_willis	I wish it was that easy, if I dual boot with windows, sometimes it breaks after windows update, and I'm always lost on the grub screen
2012-04-28T10:36:00.000Z	dr_willis	thrillERboy	 learn grub.. or toy with linux in virtualbox.. safer then wubi
2012-04-28T10:37:00.000Z	thrillERboy	dr_willis	yes, going to try virtualbox as well, sometimes I had to boot into windows just for photoshop, so, I guess, windows with photoshop and Ubuntu in Vbox is gonna work fine, for my workflow
