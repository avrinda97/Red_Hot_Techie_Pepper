2005-05-20T06:15:00.000Z	bob2	DAC1138	why do you ask?
2005-05-20T06:16:00.000Z	DAC1138	bob2	im just wondering what's going on with them. are they still shipping cds? i set an order for some hoary cds march 25th, and they said hoary wont ship until mid april
2005-05-20T06:16:00.000Z	bob2	DAC1138	they should be on their way to you
2005-05-20T06:16:00.000Z	DAC1138	bob2	ive got some friends who want some cds, and im wondering if it would be faster to just burn them myself. but i know as soon as i get them burned, theyll arrive the next day in the mail
2005-05-20T06:17:00.000Z	bob2	DAC1138	well, ideally they should be there now
2005-07-23T05:18:00.000Z	bob2	DAC1138	yes, which ubuntu uses by default: gksu
2005-07-23T06:55:00.000Z	bob2	DAC1138	you can, it has been ported to run directly on the framebuffer, and it works on windows without X
2005-07-23T07:30:00.000Z	DAC1138	bob2	hes had enough warnings, i'd say boot him
2005-07-26T08:02:00.000Z	bob2	DAC1138	qemu
2005-07-27T07:16:00.000Z	bob2	DAC1138	w0wz0rz what was the subject of the email you guys sent to the mailing list?
2005-07-27T07:17:00.000Z	DAC1138	bob2	no, i havent sent anything to the mailing list, except for my graphics card glitch a few months back
2005-07-27T07:17:00.000Z	bob2	DAC1138	I'd suggest asking there
2005-07-27T07:18:00.000Z	bob2	DAC1138	and you filed a bug report?
2005-07-27T07:18:00.000Z	DAC1138	bob2	for the gfx card yes
2005-07-27T07:18:00.000Z	DAC1138	bob2	and thats when it stopped working in the next ubuntu release (this was back in warty)
