2008-01-21T20:06:00.000Z	bobbob1016		I'm converting videos with mencoder, flv to avi.  I'm using "mencoder input.flv -o output.avi -ovc x264 -x264encopts threads=3:bitrate=500 -oac mp3lame -lameopts abr:br=52" I have a hyper-threaded machine, not sure if using the dual-core command applies, but should those commands give me the same quality as the original flv?
2008-01-21T20:07:00.000Z	bobbob1016		How would I check that the video is the same quality?
2008-01-21T20:07:00.000Z	nemo	bobbob1016	if you find a version of mencoder and filter strings that don't result in a/v lag, please let me know :-/
2008-01-21T20:07:00.000Z	nemo	bobbob1016	video won't be same quality obviously since you are re-encoding
2008-01-21T20:08:00.000Z	nemo	bobbob1016	question is if it is good enough for you
2008-01-21T20:08:00.000Z	bobbob1016	nemo	How much quality loss will I have though, a significant amount, as in 25% or more like 10%?
2008-01-21T20:09:00.000Z	nemo	bobbob1016	these aren't things you measure in percentages :-p
2008-01-21T20:09:00.000Z	nemo	bobbob1016	TIAS
2008-01-21T20:09:00.000Z	nemo	bobbob1016	and try #mplayer
2008-01-21T20:09:00.000Z	bobbob1016	nemo	Do you have a better way I can convert the videos then?  Since you don't seem too fond of mencoder.
2008-01-21T20:09:00.000Z	nemo	bobbob1016	and do let me know if you find a combination and ubuntu mencoder package that don't have a/v desync
2008-01-21T20:09:00.000Z	nemo	bobbob1016	actually, I'm quite fond of it
2008-01-21T20:10:00.000Z	nemo	bobbob1016	I just can't seem to get it to elminate audio lag from flv, and is annoying me
2008-01-21T20:10:00.000Z	nemo	bobbob1016	I mean, without hand-tuning lag.
2008-01-21T20:15:00.000Z	bobbob1016	nemo	By A/V sync, you mean the audio gets out of sync?  Do you know of any program that doesn't do that?  Does mencoder work with rm to avi as well?
2008-01-21T20:18:00.000Z	nemo	bobbob1016	ask in #mplayer
2008-01-21T20:18:00.000Z	nemo	bobbob1016	and is possible to tweak the intervals to acceptable manually, and possibly more advanced tweaks I don't know about
2008-01-21T20:18:00.000Z	nemo	bobbob1016	and for all I know, is fixed in later mplayer
2008-01-21T20:19:00.000Z	bobbob1016	nemo	Thanks
