2011-02-15T05:16:00.000Z	minimec	Photocopy	Ok. This could be my playground... The ati x1200 is a special version of the x1250 integrated chipset. It is supported (but not that good)... there is much going on on ati drivers. You may consider the x-edgers ppa and install the bleeding edge ATi drivers. Also if you are running ubuntu 10.04, swich to a 2.6.35 kernel. It has better support for ATi graphics. You will even have gallium 3d and a new 2.6.38 kernel in that ppa. I am ru
2011-02-15T05:20:00.000Z	minimec	Photocopy	ok. short. The x1200 x1250 series is much better supported with the x-edgers ppa (including gallium 3d and 2.6.35 and 2.6.38 kernel)
2011-02-15T05:21:00.000Z	minimec	Photocopy	the ppa includes the bleeding edge xorg stuck including mesa gallium 3d driver (default in natty 11.04 for ATI cards)
2011-02-15T05:21:00.000Z	minimec	Photocopy	stack ...
2011-02-15T05:22:00.000Z	Photocopy	minimec	seems to know, coz_ Thanks for the help though
2011-02-15T05:22:00.000Z	minimec	Photocopy	I am using the x1250 AMD/ATI combination, while yours should be one of this rare Intel/ATI combinations.
2011-02-15T05:24:00.000Z	minimec	Photocopy	Bedtime here in Switzerland... It's 1.30 AM ... ;)
2011-02-15T05:25:00.000Z	minimec	Photocopy	sudo add apt-repository x-edgers... Update the system reboot (if you installed the new kernels) That should be all. You don't need to install the ppa kernels.

2011-02-15T05:27:00.000Z	minimec	Photocopy	https://launchpad.net/~xorg-edgers/+archive/ppa
2011-02-15T05:31:00.000Z	minimec	Photocopy	just add the ppa and update the system. it will update the packages.
2011-02-15T05:34:00.000Z	minimec	Photocopy	I use it with my x1250. You can remove the ppa if you installed purge-ppa before.
2011-02-15T05:35:00.000Z	minimec	Photocopy	no problem. It's ppa-purge... http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=ppa-purge&suite=default&section=all&arch=any&searchon=names
2011-02-15T05:36:00.000Z	minimec	Photocopy	it would something like 'sudo ppa-purge x-edgers'. It only removes the given ppa.
2011-02-15T05:39:00.000Z	minimec	Photocopy	coz_: Problem is, if you have problems with a xorg ppa, you might need to reboot in recovery mode. So no GUI...
2011-02-15T05:50:00.000Z	minimec	Photocopy	Don't be so hard. I love 'irssi'. It is a command line irc client...
