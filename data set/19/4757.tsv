2008-11-12T04:34:00.000Z	eido	DasEI	i am not sure how to relaunch a failed live boot
2008-11-12T04:35:00.000Z	DasEI	eido	are you in live now ?
2008-11-12T04:35:00.000Z	eido	DasEI	yes, I see the live directory structure but don't know how to re load
2008-11-12T04:35:00.000Z	DasEI	eido	in live cd, open a terminal ..
2008-11-12T04:36:00.000Z	eido	DasEI	all I have is initramfs I can switch consoles but no change
2008-11-12T04:37:00.000Z	DasEI	eido	didn't you say you already were in live ?
2008-11-12T04:37:00.000Z	eido	DasEI	the live boot bombed and dumped me to intiramfs which seems to have minimal bash function
2008-11-12T04:38:00.000Z	DasEI	eido	I see, gotta try boot options , then.. kinda machine ? hardy or ibex ?
2008-11-12T04:39:00.000Z	eido	DasEI	kernel 2.6.24-19-eeepc
2008-11-12T04:40:00.000Z	DasEI	eido	: an asus ?
2008-11-12T04:40:00.000Z	eido	DasEI	I made a bootable usb with eeebuntu since no cd-rom on the netbook.  can boot with standard 8.10 but no nic wireless or wired and so much tweeking is needed so I went with eeebuntu which should work out of the box but i get dumped to initramfs
2008-11-12T04:40:00.000Z	eido	DasEI	yes 1000 series
2008-11-12T04:40:00.000Z	DasEI	eido	: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EeePC
2008-11-12T04:51:00.000Z	eido	DasEI	thanks I found found lots of documentation on configuring the eee to work.  my particular model does not have wired or wireless working so this documentation seems lacking compared to others.  i was more concerned with try to load a kernel at initramfs
2008-11-12T04:54:00.000Z	eido	DasEI	I cannot get to the boot options it dumps within a few seconds
2008-11-12T04:55:00.000Z	eido	DasEI	thanks I tried but it doesn't seem to give me enough time but I lll try again
