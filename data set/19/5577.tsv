2008-06-03T11:33:00.000Z	Kelvari		Can anyone here help me with the trouble I'm having with Totem?
2008-06-03T11:33:00.000Z	k1duga1	Kelvari	what's the problem?
2008-06-03T11:34:00.000Z	Kelvari	k1duga1	what's happening is that Totem is freezing (no errors) at random points during audio playback.
2008-06-03T11:38:00.000Z	k1duga1	Kelvari	totem --debug
2008-06-03T11:40:00.000Z	Kelvari	k1duga1	Not playing audio now. No output from --debug
2008-06-03T11:43:00.000Z	k1duga1	Kelvari	are you using totem-gstreamer
2008-06-03T11:44:00.000Z	Kelvari	k1duga1	Yes, I'm using totem-gstreamer
2008-06-03T11:44:00.000Z	k1duga1	Kelvari	check if the settings in gstreamer-properties are correct
2008-06-03T11:45:00.000Z	k1duga1	Kelvari	does it happen with all format or ...
2008-06-03T11:46:00.000Z	Kelvari	k1duga1	It appears to happen with all formats. Tried with .ogg (Ogg Vorbis Audio) and .MP3, known-good files.
2008-06-03T11:56:00.000Z	Kelvari	k1duga1	Could you help point me in the right direction to getting it to work?
2008-06-03T11:59:00.000Z	Kelvari	k1duga1	That gave me quite a few errors.
2008-06-03T12:00:00.000Z	Kelvari	k1duga1	Repeated the following lines: "PaHost_OpenStream: could not open /dev/dsp for O_WRONLY" and "PaHost_OpenStream: ERROR - result = -10000"
2008-06-03T12:02:00.000Z	Kelvari	k1duga1	Paste is at http://paste.ubuntu.com/16529/
2008-06-03T12:07:00.000Z	Kelvari	k1duga1	Closed firefox and getting sound from espeak command, but still no Totem playback for .ogg files
2008-06-03T12:11:00.000Z	Kelvari	k1duga1	No error from .ogg files - Totem just freezes. Also not finding Sound Output in Preferences, unless you mean the number of channels.
2008-06-03T12:15:00.000Z	Kelvari	k1duga1	did reinstall of Totem (sudo apt-get install --reinstall totem), and still freezes
2008-06-03T12:22:00.000Z	Kelvari	k1duga1	reinstalled gstreamer plugins and still no playback through totem.
2008-06-03T12:25:00.000Z	Kelvari	k1duga1	Haven't done a build-dep for any of the gstreamer, but everything that I do have has been installed decently.
