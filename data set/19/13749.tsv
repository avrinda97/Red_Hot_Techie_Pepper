2005-09-03T08:02:00.000Z	moshe		hello
2005-09-03T08:03:00.000Z	moshe		when the time comes to upgrade to breezy, will it be necessary to remove backports packages before upgrading?
2005-09-03T08:05:00.000Z	moshe		hmm
2005-09-03T08:05:00.000Z	moshe		I guess I'll have to burn a copy of breezy just in case
2005-09-03T08:05:00.000Z	moshe		my chief grudge with Linux over the years is the necessity to format my hd every six months.
2005-09-03T08:06:00.000Z	moshe		it would be refreshing not having to do that
2005-09-03T08:07:00.000Z	moshe		I was a longtime mandrake user
2005-09-03T08:07:00.000Z	moshe		I switched to Slackware last fall, and to Ubuntu about a month and a half ago.
2005-09-03T08:07:00.000Z	sobersabre	moshe	it is a refreshing change... isn't it ?
2005-09-03T08:07:00.000Z	moshe		yep
2005-09-03T08:08:00.000Z	moshe	paulproteus	well, I'm finding that I like ubuntu's customizations better
2005-09-03T08:08:00.000Z	moshe		and the fact that apt and synaptic are written in a compiled language, as opposed to urpmi being in perl, is a huge speed difference
2005-09-03T08:10:00.000Z	moshe		while I've read many times that you can use urpmi to upgrade from one version of mandrake to the next, I found that in practice, I was never able to do so.
2005-09-03T08:11:00.000Z	sobersabre	moshe	I've upgraded woody to sarge, then to sid, then back to sarge.. then to ubuntu :)
2005-09-03T08:11:00.000Z	moshe		you moved from sid to ubuntu without issues?
2005-09-03T08:11:00.000Z	moshe		we're talking about moving using apt?
2005-09-03T08:11:00.000Z	moshe		wow
2005-09-03T08:11:00.000Z	moshe		that's a major advantage
2005-09-03T08:11:00.000Z	sobersabre	moshe	I moved from sid to sarge. apt-update && apt-dist-upgrade.
