2009-12-31T02:02:00.000Z	Scunizi	gerrh	can you get to any site?
2009-12-31T02:02:00.000Z	gerrh	Scunizi	aye. all but facebook. -.-
2009-12-31T02:03:00.000Z	gerrh	Scunizi	almost prepared to accept this weird behaviour as a sign of sorts.. :D
2009-12-31T02:03:00.000Z	Scunizi	gerrh	when you try to go to facebook what kind of error do you get?
2009-12-31T02:04:00.000Z	gerrh	Scunizi	Server not found in firefox, Host not found in links, and so on
2009-12-31T02:04:00.000Z	gerrh	Scunizi	yet facebook.com responds to my pings
2009-12-31T02:05:00.000Z	gerrh	Scunizi	it's almost as if they have blocked me or something..
2009-12-31T02:05:00.000Z	Scunizi	gerrh	can you get to it via ip?
2009-12-31T02:06:00.000Z	gerrh	Scunizi	indeed i can.
2009-12-31T02:06:00.000Z	gerrh	Scunizi	guess dns somewhere along the way is fubared then ey
2009-12-31T02:07:00.000Z	Scunizi	gerrh	when you try to get there with the domain name are  you typing the www or just "facebook.com"..
2009-12-31T02:07:00.000Z	gerrh	Scunizi	tried both www. and facebook.com alone
2009-12-31T02:07:00.000Z	gerrh	Scunizi	made no difference
2009-12-31T02:07:00.000Z	gerrh	Scunizi	haha..epic. Firefox can't find the server at login.63.187.17.
2009-12-31T02:08:00.000Z	Scunizi	gerrh	then you're correct.. dns is messed someplace.  if you have a router you might want to try using the opendns.com dns servers.. they are listed at the bottom of their page..
2009-12-31T02:08:00.000Z	gerrh	Scunizi	tried logging in after getting the connection via ip
2009-12-31T02:08:00.000Z	gerrh	Scunizi	it's strange that the windows boxes doesn't seem to suffer though isn't it.
2009-12-31T02:09:00.000Z	Scunizi	gerrh	that is weird.. I've no answer for this one .. sorry
2009-12-31T02:09:00.000Z	gerrh	Scunizi	no worries. thanks anyhow. :>
