2006-04-20T10:17:00.000Z	blindx		lol misguided. well you learn quickly, trying to tweak, in any case.
2006-04-20T10:17:00.000Z	blindx		lol.
2006-04-20T10:19:00.000Z	blindx		or.. you could make the file with an echo command, but that gets tricky, and it's unnecessary
2006-04-20T10:19:00.000Z	blindx		K.I.S.S. ?
2006-04-20T10:19:00.000Z	blindx		hahah
2006-04-20T10:20:00.000Z	blindx		i just like to throw out alternatives :P
2006-04-20T10:20:00.000Z	blindx		nah, must have missed it
2006-04-20T10:21:00.000Z	blindx		Well.. you could... add gksudo gedit to the applications list.
2006-04-20T10:22:00.000Z	blindx		then right click, run with other application
2006-04-20T10:24:00.000Z	blindx		how can I get my monitor to run at 1280x1024 screen resolution, without running the reconfigure thing, cause that doesn't work.
2006-04-20T10:26:00.000Z	resin	blindx	edit XF86Config-4 i think it is
2006-04-20T10:26:00.000Z	resin		i use xorg so i forgot
2006-04-20T10:30:00.000Z	blindx		Even after editing my xorg.conf file, my resolution won't show.
2006-04-20T10:30:00.000Z	blindx		 :\
2006-04-20T10:31:00.000Z	blindx		I know my monitor can handle 1280x1024 though.
2006-04-20T10:31:00.000Z	blindx	_jon	I edited it once, and it worked, but it was at 43hz
2006-04-20T10:31:00.000Z	blindx		and was blinking. so i edited it again
2006-04-20T10:31:00.000Z	blindx		and haven't been able to get it back to 1280 :\
2006-04-20T10:31:00.000Z	resin	blindx	drivers installed? did you try a reboot?
