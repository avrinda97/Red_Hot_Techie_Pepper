2009-11-18T22:59:00.000Z	nemo		Anyone notice compiz seems to crash a *LOT* more in 9.10?
2009-11-18T22:59:00.000Z	nemo		like, every couple of days?
2009-11-18T23:00:00.000Z	docmax	nemo	not for me... same crash frequency =)
2009-11-18T23:00:00.000Z	nemo	docmax	ah :-p
2009-11-18T23:01:00.000Z	docmax	nemo	every 2 days
2009-11-18T23:01:00.000Z	docmax	nemo	depends on utilization
2009-11-18T23:02:00.000Z	docmax	nemo	seems that L2 cache on cpu did not write back cached data to RFX pipeline
2009-11-18T23:03:00.000Z	nemo	docmax	wait, wut? where are you getting this from?
2009-11-18T23:03:00.000Z	docmax	nemo	its assembly code from L2 cpu cache
2009-11-18T23:05:00.000Z	docmax	nemo	can you compile compiz with option --debug for debugging code? i will fix this for you
2009-11-18T23:05:00.000Z	nemo	docmax	ugh :( compiling compiz is such a pain
2009-11-18T23:05:00.000Z	nemo	docmax	I'll do it though, sure. it'll just take a bit, since I'm at work and have some delivery deadlines today
2009-11-18T23:05:00.000Z	docmax	nemo	ok
2009-11-18T23:06:00.000Z	docmax	nemo	u have the latest gfx drivers?
2009-11-18T23:06:00.000Z	nemo	docmax	latest fglrx?
2009-11-18T23:06:00.000Z	docmax	nemo	nvidia drivers? or ati?
2009-11-18T23:06:00.000Z	nemo	docmax	well. on my ATI machine right now - using whatever ubuntu 9.10 feels is what I should be using
2009-11-18T23:07:00.000Z	nemo	docmax	however I haven't rebooted in 19 days
2009-11-18T23:11:00.000Z	nemo	docmax	... what features from windows explorer should it have?
