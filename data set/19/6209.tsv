2008-12-18T22:46:00.000Z	Ward1983		are there daily builds of ubuntu 8.10?
2008-12-18T22:47:00.000Z	Ward1983		white-sheepso there is no way to get hold of a updated liveCD ? only the one with a old kernel is available?
2008-12-18T22:47:00.000Z	hischild	Ward1983	get the minimal CD and install from there then.
2008-12-18T22:47:00.000Z	Ward1983	hischild	its not to install, its to make a persistent liveboot
2008-12-18T22:49:00.000Z	Ward1983	hischild	do you know if unetobotin supports netinst?
2008-12-18T22:50:00.000Z	hischild	Ward1983	i'm not sure.
2008-12-18T22:50:00.000Z	Ward1983	hischild	ill check, but i think it does, i never thought of that
2008-12-18T22:53:00.000Z	Ward1983	hischild	yes it does support netinst, both 32 and 64 bit even :D:D:D
2008-12-18T22:53:00.000Z	Ward1983	hischild	thanx lol i never even thought of it
2008-12-21T23:54:00.000Z	hischild	Ward1983	grep -i audio might be better, case independent.
2008-12-21T23:55:00.000Z	Ward1983	hischild	i thought that part was universal
2008-12-21T23:55:00.000Z	hischild	Ward1983	what you mean?
2008-12-21T23:55:00.000Z	Ward1983	hischild	00:1b.0 Audio device:
2008-12-21T23:56:00.000Z	hischild	Ward1983	only thing i'm sayin is that if you use grep -i it'll show all parts, no matter the case it's in, either capital or normal case.
2008-12-21T23:57:00.000Z	Ward1983	hischild	yes all i'm saying is i thought it does't mather in this case :)
2008-12-21T23:57:00.000Z	hischild	Ward1983	i'm not saying it does matter in this case. It's for future reference
2008-12-21T23:57:00.000Z	Ward1983	hischild	lol i knew it :)
2008-12-21T23:58:00.000Z	Ward1983	hischild	thanx though :)
