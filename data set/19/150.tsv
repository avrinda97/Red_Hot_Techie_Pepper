2012-11-05T03:22:00.000Z	adaminsull		Hi
2012-11-05T03:22:00.000Z	adaminsull		When using sudo I get this
2012-11-05T03:23:00.000Z	adaminsull		ircd is not in the sudoers file.  This incident will be reported.
2012-11-05T03:23:00.000Z	escott	adaminsull	why is your username ircd?
2012-11-05T03:23:00.000Z	adaminsull	escott	Because i'm using it not as root
2012-11-05T03:23:00.000Z	escott	adaminsull	thats a really odd choice
2012-11-05T03:24:00.000Z	adaminsull	escott	You cannot do unrealircd as root
2012-11-05T03:24:00.000Z	escott	adaminsull	you should have a normal username "adam" or whatever you want, and then isntall unrealircd which should create an ircd account under which it will run
2012-11-05T03:24:00.000Z	adaminsull	escott	Well how do I add to sudoers file
2012-11-05T03:25:00.000Z	escott	adaminsull	there are lots of accounts *d that should have NO ACCESS to the system. whose sole purpose is to run various daemons
2012-11-05T03:25:00.000Z	escott	adaminsull	if you configure your sudoers file to allow a *d account to sudo then you are doing it wrong
2012-11-05T03:25:00.000Z	adaminsull	escott	I havent set it up
2012-11-05T03:27:00.000Z	escott	adaminsull	when you install set your username as "adam" (or whatever you would use on your desktop) you will use "adam" to administer the system and "adam" will be able to sudo. "adam" will install unrealircd and unrealircd should create an ircd account which is locked (preventing anyone from using it)
2012-11-05T03:27:00.000Z	adaminsull	escott	I don't understand unix so can u just tell me how to allow it access?
2012-11-05T03:27:00.000Z	escott	adaminsull	no i will not. because what you are proposing is wrong
2012-11-05T03:28:00.000Z	adaminsull	escott	I need to give it permission to use sudo but how?
2012-11-05T03:30:00.000Z	escott	adaminsull	im not answering that question. i would suggest you ask in #backtrack-linux they will happily help you set that up and compromise your system at the same time
2012-11-05T03:32:00.000Z	adaminsull	escott	How do I read main
2012-11-05T03:39:00.000Z	adaminsull	escott	Can I read main?
