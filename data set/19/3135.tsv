2009-12-27T05:06:00.000Z	Ose		[00:36] <Ose> can anyone help me get my comp online? I have an USB wifi dongle that did work, until the network changed. I got help with getting it on last time, but because of the new encryption settings I can't do it again on my own
2009-12-27T05:06:00.000Z	Ose		:P
2009-12-27T05:09:00.000Z	mMezquitale	Ose	sorry meant to ssay lsusb
2009-12-27T05:09:00.000Z	Ose	mMezquitale	no problem
2009-12-27T05:11:00.000Z	mMezquitale	Ose	if your network "changed" then you have to figure out what those changes are, like for example if it's secured then you have to change the password, we cant figure it out unless we know what those changes are
2009-12-27T05:12:00.000Z	Ose	mMezquitale	it's a brand new network
2009-12-27T05:12:00.000Z	Ose		just with the same router
2009-12-27T05:12:00.000Z	Ose		i.e. the router was reset
2009-12-27T05:14:00.000Z	mMezquitale	Ose	if the router was reset then most likely the password was changed, that's the first possibililty
