2010-07-07T03:31:00.000Z	jcompute000		Does anyone know how compatible this computer is with Ubuntu if the most graphics I will probably be using are things like Compiz: http://www.bestbuy.com/site/Compaq+-+Presario+Desktop+with+AMD+Athlon%26%23153%3B+II+Dual-Core+Processor/9693859.p?id=1218152062935&skuId=9693859
2010-07-07T03:31:00.000Z	soreau	jcompute000	What gpu does it have?
2010-07-07T03:32:00.000Z	jcompute000		NVIDIA GeForce 6150 SE
2010-07-07T03:33:00.000Z	jcompute000	soreau	NVIDIA GeForce 6150 SE
2010-07-07T03:34:00.000Z	soreau	jcompute000	I don't see any reason why it wouldn't work. That card can run compiz just fine, as long as the driver is willing to cooperate
2010-07-07T03:37:00.000Z	jcompute000	soreau	That is the issue that I am concerned about. I know conceptually it should run fine, but I also know that some grapics cards give certian driver problems that will cause them not to be able to do things like 3D rendering. I just got done with another computer (an older on, so I kind of expected it) that had that issue. I was just wondering if anyone knows for sure whether that will work. Also, what about a computer with 
2010-07-07T03:39:00.000Z	soreau	jcompute000	Every graphics driver has it's own set of problems, there's no denying that. However, while nvidia is proprietary, doesn't cooperate with OSS devs and deosn't even support xrandr1.2 yet, also with the lack of general community support you get (from actual driver devs), I see radeon as a much better bet
2010-07-07T03:39:00.000Z	soreau	jcompute000	The radeon driver is OSS, is already better than it's proprietary counterpart in most areas, supports xrandr fully and you have limitless support from real radeon driver devs in #radeon
2010-07-07T03:40:00.000Z	jcompute000	soreau	Ok, thanks for you help. I mostly wish there was a way I could test it at the store, but I'm sure Best Buy and company would not appreciate me using an Ubuntu live CD on their floor models, lol.
2010-07-07T03:42:00.000Z	soreau	jcompute000	Dude, ask the sales guy.. I bet he might let you if there's no store policy against that kind of thing (doesnt hurt to ask ;)
2010-07-07T03:43:00.000Z	jcompute000	soreau	Yea, thanks. I may do that. But also, I am not sure how much I can test from the live CD. Obviously, if it works right off the bat, then I am golden. But if I have to install a driver, then I don't know if the live CD will be an easy way to test that.
2010-07-07T03:45:00.000Z	soreau	jcompute000	If it has a internet connection, just install the nvidia driver with jockey (sys>admin>hardware drivers) then when it asks you to reboot, restart gdm instead from tty
2010-07-07T03:46:00.000Z	jcompute000	soreau	Although I don't have much practice, because I don't install Ubuntu on tons of different machines (I'm not rich), I think I could manage that much, though thanks for clarifying, it may have taken me longer to figure out. However, I would feel aquward standing there doing all that on a floor model, even if they say its ok.
2010-07-07T03:46:00.000Z	soreau	jcompute000	Rock out with your cock out xD
2010-07-07T03:47:00.000Z	jcompute000	soreau	Also, do you know if an IntelÂ® Graphics Media Accelerator X4500 would have any better or worse chance of working?
2010-07-07T03:47:00.000Z	soreau	jcompute000	Probably worse since the state of the intel drivers is not very good and integrated chips are just inferior
2010-07-07T03:48:00.000Z	jcompute000	soreau	Thats what I figured, although thats odd, since I am currently looking at three different computers, and the most expensive of the three (they are all under $600) is the only one that has the Intel instead of the nVidia
2010-07-07T03:49:00.000Z	soreau	jcompute000	Ideally, I'd recommend an r5-7xx card which means X1300-X1950 and and of the HDxxxx series
2010-07-07T03:50:00.000Z	jcompute000	soreau	Yes, I know I could probably get better than what I am looking at. My main goal for this computer is a computer that works well enough to do a few specail things that I need compiz working for, but it will not be my main computer. As such, I don't want something too expensive, so I am trying to figure out which of the cheaper ones will work.
