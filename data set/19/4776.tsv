2008-11-05T02:55:00.000Z	f00barista	qowao	popd to "jump back". or cd - to go back to the last dir you've been at
2008-11-05T03:00:00.000Z	f00barista	qowao	pushd does save. pushd /foo/bar would 1) take you to /foo/bar and 2) save the dir from which you come from
2008-11-05T03:00:00.000Z	qowao	f00barista	but i wanna store the current dir! pushd does not doe it!
2008-11-05T03:01:00.000Z	f00barista	qowao	wherever you are, try "pushd /tmp"
2008-11-05T03:02:00.000Z	f00barista	qowao	if you really wanna save the current dir, you could also save it in a variable
2008-11-05T03:03:00.000Z	f00barista	qowao	no, cos "popd" isnt a dir. i mean, you could if there were a "popd" folder wherever you are
2008-11-05T03:06:00.000Z	f00barista	qowao	yep
2008-11-05T03:06:00.000Z	f00barista	qowao	precisely
2008-11-05T03:08:00.000Z	f00barista	qowao	yep
