2006-07-30T11:39:00.000Z	theshibboleth		Does anyone know how I get a cell phone working with Ubuntu? I want to be able to transfer files to it and that sort of thing. It's connected through usb, but isn't mounting. I'm not sure how to or if I can mount it manually.
2006-07-30T11:39:00.000Z	dmsantam	theshibboleth	what cell phone?
2006-07-30T11:39:00.000Z	theshibboleth	dmsantam	it's a Samsung sch-a850.
2006-07-30T11:39:00.000Z	dmsantam	theshibboleth	afaik there is no software for that phone
2006-07-30T11:40:00.000Z	dmsantam	theshibboleth	you can write your own, it actually isn't that hard. very similar to talking to a modem
2006-07-30T11:40:00.000Z	theshibboleth	dmsantam	ok. is there some sort of how-to somewhere?
2006-07-30T11:40:00.000Z	dmsantam	theshibboleth	i don't think so :(
2006-07-30T11:40:00.000Z	theshibboleth	dmsantam	so what would I need to do then?
2006-07-30T11:42:00.000Z	dmsantam	theshibboleth	well, linux will treat it as a usb modem
2006-07-30T11:42:00.000Z	dmsantam	theshibboleth	you have to write an app that talks to it with appropriate AT commands
2006-07-30T11:42:00.000Z	dmsantam	theshibboleth	its not a 5 minutes job
2006-07-30T11:42:00.000Z	dmsantam	theshibboleth	http://tuxoft.de/V3/
2006-07-30T11:42:00.000Z	dmsantam	theshibboleth	very similar to that
2006-07-30T11:45:00.000Z	dmsantam	theshibboleth	check this out: http://tuxmobil.org/phones_linux.html
2006-07-30T11:51:00.000Z	theshibboleth	dmsantam	you know the first time I saw that TuxMobil page I thought it was for installing Linux on the cell phone. By the way, do you know what "dedicated Linux phone" means?
2006-07-30T11:52:00.000Z	dmsantam	theshibboleth	no, i don't know what it means
2006-07-30T11:52:00.000Z	dmsantam	theshibboleth	try out "kmobiletools"
2006-07-30T11:52:00.000Z	dmsantam	theshibboleth	it works with my phone. i have the Motorola RAZR V3
2006-07-30T11:53:00.000Z	dmsantam	theshibboleth	kmobiletools seems to support a lot of phones though.
