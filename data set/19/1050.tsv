2012-01-09T17:04:00.000Z	abhinavmehta		its a cloud-provisioning script…so I can have any of them…or both of them installed, but using some one of them…so checking the path for both won't be a good idea, I guess.
2012-01-09T17:05:00.000Z	abhinavmehta		yes, I know…in that situation I'll fail with error.
2012-01-09T17:06:00.000Z	abhinavmehta		but I want to support at least the grub1, grub2, and lilo
2012-01-09T17:08:00.000Z	abhinavmehta		guys..isn't there some os-config file where info about active boot-loader is stored..?
2012-01-09T17:10:00.000Z	abhinavmehta		yes..thats true…but there should be some config-file or something…from where the os takes this information..right..?
2012-01-09T17:10:00.000Z	theadmin	abhinavmehta	The OS doesn't deal with the bootloader at all. It's quite the exact opposite.
2012-01-09T17:12:00.000Z	abhinavmehta	theadmin	you have a valid point…but than how it is loaded into the memory…? what if both boot loaders are installed…than which will be used…who will decide this..?
2012-01-09T17:12:00.000Z	theadmin	abhinavmehta	The one which is in MBR will be loaded, that's all.
2012-01-09T17:12:00.000Z	abhinavmehta	theadmin	so you mean…I should read the starting addresses of my disk…to find boot loader info..?
2012-01-09T17:13:00.000Z	abhinavmehta	theadmin	just trying to make myself clear..?
2012-01-09T17:13:00.000Z	theadmin	abhinavmehta	Uh, I'd rather check which bootloader is installed package-wise. I doubt installing two of them is even possible.
2012-01-09T17:14:00.000Z	abhinavmehta	theadmin	its possible…I did on this my VM-instance.
2012-01-09T17:14:00.000Z	theadmin	abhinavmehta	Hm, okay, well this is a mess...
2012-01-09T17:15:00.000Z	theadmin	abhinavmehta	I don't think the OS provides any way to find out what bootloader is stored in MBR, sorry.
2012-01-09T17:17:00.000Z	abhinavmehta	theadmin	yes..and no. I've few reasons to believe that OS stores this info somewhere.
2012-01-09T17:18:00.000Z	theadmin	abhinavmehta	Ok, sorry, I don't know. So I guess asking someone else is a better bet.
2012-01-09T17:19:00.000Z	abhinavmehta	theadmin	not a problem…and thanks for your kind-inputs. :)
2012-01-09T17:19:00.000Z	theadmin	abhinavmehta	The page you show just reads the first few sectors of the disk and searches for a string in them
2012-01-09T17:19:00.000Z	theadmin	abhinavmehta	I mean, the suggestion on that page.
