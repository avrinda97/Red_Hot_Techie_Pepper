2006-06-09T12:24:00.000Z	Kaius		[MH] Narc`Lap> No idea...
2006-06-09T12:24:00.000Z	Kaius		But that would worry me.
2006-06-09T12:26:00.000Z	Kaius		sharky_> Are you running a custom kernel or the standard Ubuntu?
2006-06-09T12:27:00.000Z	sharky_	Kaius	standard
2006-06-09T12:28:00.000Z	sharky_	Kaius	i did: sudo /sbin/hdparm -i /dev/hdb
2006-06-09T12:28:00.000Z	sharky_	Kaius	which tells me the the system does see the disk, but i guess it doesnt get mounted properly for some reason
2006-06-09T12:29:00.000Z	sharky_	Kaius	yeah i know i was actually able to mount the drive when i was on the liveCD
2006-06-09T12:29:00.000Z	sharky_	Kaius	do you mean like apt-get some module or there is something i have that's just not running yet?
2006-06-09T12:30:00.000Z	sharky_	Kaius	nothing no output
2006-06-09T12:31:00.000Z	sharky_	Kaius	ntfs                  101376  0
2006-06-09T12:33:00.000Z	sharky_	Kaius	still nothing
2006-06-09T12:33:00.000Z	sharky_	Kaius	sudo mount /dev/hdb /home/shahrukh/media/ -t ntfs -o nls=utf8,umask=0222
2006-06-09T12:34:00.000Z	sharky_	Kaius	no output
2006-06-09T12:36:00.000Z	sharky_	Kaius	i tried /dev/hdb1 .. /dev/hdb5  all give mount: special device /dev/hdb4 does not exist
2006-06-09T12:37:00.000Z	sharky_	Kaius	i remember when i was using the liveCD the i had to mount /dev/hdb5
2006-06-09T12:37:00.000Z	sharky_	Kaius	not sure what that means
2006-06-09T12:37:00.000Z	sharky_	Kaius	it was simply a storage disk i never booted from it
2006-06-09T12:38:00.000Z	sharky_	Kaius	/dev/hdb5 does not work
