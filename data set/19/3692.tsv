2009-06-12T06:59:00.000Z	SuperSenior	matrixblue	amen to that!
2009-06-15T07:50:00.000Z	matrixblue	SuperSenior	does the system detect any wireless cards?
2009-06-15T07:50:00.000Z	SuperSenior	matrixblue	Im not sure, whats the command?
2009-06-15T07:51:00.000Z	matrixblue	SuperSenior	just click the network manager icon on the taskbar
2009-06-15T07:51:00.000Z	SuperSenior	matrixblue	they are all greyed-out so I guess not.
2009-06-15T07:52:00.000Z	matrixblue	SuperSenior	is "Wireless Networks" on that list at all?
2009-06-15T07:53:00.000Z	SuperSenior	matrixblue	yes, but i cant select it. it seems to be disabled or unavailible.
2009-06-15T07:54:00.000Z	matrixblue	SuperSenior	and you're certain a wireless network is in range?
2009-06-15T07:54:00.000Z	SuperSenior	matrixblue	yes i am on my windows laptop right next to it using the wifi
2009-06-15T07:55:00.000Z	matrixblue	SuperSenior	pastebin the output of lspci -a please
2009-06-15T07:59:00.000Z	SuperSenior	matrixblue	ill need a few minutes to hook it up directly to the router to access pastebin
2009-06-15T07:59:00.000Z	matrixblue	SuperSenior	ok
2009-06-15T08:02:00.000Z	SuperSenior	matrixblue	lspci -a correct? does that litterally list the pci cards installed?
2009-06-15T08:03:00.000Z	matrixblue	SuperSenior	yeah
2009-06-15T08:08:00.000Z	SuperSenior	matrixblue	i cant get the laptop to stay on. even though the icon on the keyboard shows it as running of ac power, it warns of critical battery level and shuts off
2009-06-15T08:08:00.000Z	matrixblue	SuperSenior	it seems you have bigger problems than the wireless then
2009-06-15T08:09:00.000Z	SuperSenior	matrixblue	no kidding haha
