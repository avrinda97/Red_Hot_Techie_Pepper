2009-04-29T00:51:00.000Z	sebsebseb	kemr	by adding it to  /boot/grub/menu.lst
2009-04-29T00:51:00.000Z	sebsebseb	kemr	gksudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst  it even  shows you how to add it
2009-04-29T00:54:00.000Z	kemr	sebsebseb	I see the entry, but I'm not sure what to fill in for the details. Can you tell me how to figure out the Root to use for the entry?
2009-04-29T00:54:00.000Z	sebsebseb	kemr	it shows you as an example in that file,  how to add Windows
2009-04-29T00:54:00.000Z	sebsebseb	kemr	so you do something similar to the example where the OS's go and make sure to uncomment stuff by removing the #
2009-04-29T00:57:00.000Z	kemr	sebsebseb	How do I determine the "Root" property? It says (hd0,0) right now, but when I try to boot with that it doesn't come up. How should I go about determining the correct root for the entry?
2009-04-29T00:58:00.000Z	sebsebseb	kemr	is  XP your first partition?
2009-04-29T00:58:00.000Z	kemr	sebsebseb	I'm not sure... How do I check?
2009-04-29T00:58:00.000Z	sebsebseb	kemr	ok what does it say for Ubuntu?
2009-04-29T00:59:00.000Z	kemr	sebsebseb	For ubuntu it only gives a UUID which is very long and not very clear
2009-04-29T01:00:00.000Z	sebsebseb	kemr	ok you did a wubi install?
2009-04-29T01:00:00.000Z	kemr	sebsebseb	What's a wubi install?
2009-04-29T01:01:00.000Z	sebsebseb	kemr	pastebin  your  grub.menu.list

2009-04-29T01:03:00.000Z	kemr	sebsebseb	I added everything to do with Windows.
2009-04-29T01:05:00.000Z	kemr	sebsebseb	So, any ideas?
2009-04-29T01:09:00.000Z	sebsebseb	kemr	your pastebin link not working
2009-04-29T01:13:00.000Z	kemr	sebsebseb	Sorry, the pastebin thing must have been slightly corrept. I actually figured out the issue moments later anyway. Turns out Windows was located at (h0,1)
