2005-02-18T07:54:00.000Z	boaz		Package ant is not available, but is referred to by another package.
2005-02-18T07:54:00.000Z	boaz		This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or
2005-02-18T07:54:00.000Z	boaz		is only available from another source
2005-02-18T07:54:00.000Z	boaz		However the following packages replace it:
2005-02-18T07:54:00.000Z	boaz		  libant1.5-java
2005-02-18T07:54:00.000Z	boaz		E: Package ant has no installation candidate
2005-02-18T07:55:00.000Z	boaz		java build tool
2005-02-18T07:55:00.000Z	boaz		I installed it
2005-02-18T07:55:00.000Z	tritium	boaz	it's in universe in Hoary.  Same should go for Warty.
2005-02-18T07:56:00.000Z	tritium	boaz	did you "sudo apt-get install libant1.5-java"?
2005-02-18T07:57:00.000Z	tritium	boaz	that should work, but just using "ant" won't work
2005-02-18T07:58:00.000Z	tritium	boaz	you asked how to install ant on Warty.
2005-02-18T08:00:00.000Z	tritium	boaz	"dpkg -L libant1.5-java" to find out what files it installed
2005-02-18T08:07:00.000Z	tritium	boaz	unlikely
2005-02-18T08:08:00.000Z	tritium	boaz	did you verify the files in the package?
2005-02-18T08:09:00.000Z	tritium	boaz	so "sudo apt-get install --reinstall libant1.5-java"
2005-02-18T08:09:00.000Z	tritium	boaz	it's a library
