2007-08-04T11:54:00.000Z	alieas		It doesn't even say anything in /var/log/proftpd !   wtf!  no logging on a "421" denied error ??????  how is that even possible that it errors and doesn't log ?
2007-08-04T11:55:00.000Z	alieas		Seriously out of everybody here no one has had a "421" problem with ftp servers???
2007-08-04T11:55:00.000Z	xenoie	alieas	You are getting a 421 error when connecting to ftp servers or...?
2007-08-04T11:56:00.000Z	alieas	xenoie	I installed pro-ftpd on a server, and I can't connec to localhost
2007-08-04T11:58:00.000Z	xenoie	alieas	did you install as standalone or identd?
2007-08-04T11:59:00.000Z	alieas	xenoie	 inetd, but I have tried both in the .conf file
2007-08-04T11:59:00.000Z	alieas	xenoie	 I then install xinetd, which didn't do anything
2007-08-04T12:00:00.000Z	xenoie	alieas	look in /etc/init.d/ for xinetd
2007-08-04T12:00:00.000Z	alieas	xenoie	yes, exists
2007-08-04T12:01:00.000Z	alieas	xenoie	if I try to execute xinetd it says its not installed, I removed the package
2007-08-04T12:01:00.000Z	xenoie	alieas	you need that package installed if you installed proftpd to run under inetd
2007-08-04T12:02:00.000Z	alieas	xenoie	 I install it and run and then it says it can't start in either indetd or standalone mode
2007-08-04T12:03:00.000Z	alieas	xenoie	 oh thank god, ok - dpkg-reconfigure proftpd -> standalone, and installed xinetd and its accepting connections
2007-08-04T12:03:00.000Z	xenoie	alieas	there you go :)
2007-08-04T12:03:00.000Z	alieas	xenoie	 much appreciated
2007-08-04T12:04:00.000Z	alieas	xenoie	 I'm on a tough time schedule.. sorry for the brashness
2007-08-04T12:04:00.000Z	xenoie	alieas	xinetd is basically a service that runs to detect connections on a port and runs a deamon on the fly to accept the connections according to the configuration you have for it
2007-08-04T12:07:00.000Z	alieas	xenoie	 I must usually select standalone, but selected inetd this time for some reason.  I'll just make sure to always select "standalone" for now on.  I didn't think dpkg-recongiure would do anything because I changed the .conf file to "standalone" and that didn't work
2007-08-04T12:08:00.000Z	xenoie	alieas	xinetd does have it's benifits. You should look it up to see if it suits your neeeds :)
