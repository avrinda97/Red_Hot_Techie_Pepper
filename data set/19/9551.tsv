2006-10-24T12:24:00.000Z	jimmypw	EmxBA	try the command - sudo /etc/init.d/ssh restart - does it generate an error message
2006-10-24T12:25:00.000Z	jimmypw	EmxBA	are u sure the port is open type netstat -a
2006-10-24T12:27:00.000Z	jimmypw	EmxBA	is it on your home network i.e. are ou directly connected, not going through a firewall?
2006-10-24T12:30:00.000Z	jimmypw	EmxBA	Has it ever worked and are you using OpenSSH server?
2006-10-24T12:30:00.000Z	EmxBA	jimmypw	it has worked few weeks ago...
2006-10-24T12:33:00.000Z	jimmypw	EmxBA	1 more question can u ping the machine
2006-10-24T12:33:00.000Z	EmxBA	jimmypw	i CAN ping my machine, i have ftp and http server there too, but ssh doesn't work
2006-10-24T12:36:00.000Z	jimmypw	EmxBA	im no expert at SSH but if your sure nothing has changed try uninstalling using apt-get purge openssh then reinstall. I know that there are minimal configuration files that should be backed up before you do this
2006-10-24T12:37:00.000Z	jimmypw	EmxBA	obviously try other solutions before the last suggestion
