2007-09-15T06:32:00.000Z	Pc_Dark		can you minimize rhythmbox to the tray, so it's not in the task bar at all?
2007-09-15T06:33:00.000Z	wolferine	Pc_Dark	just lazy ?
2007-09-15T06:33:00.000Z	Pc_Dark	wolferine	i want it out of my site, so I can work
2007-09-15T06:34:00.000Z	wolferine	Pc_Dark	did you actually look in the application before asking the question ?
2007-09-15T06:34:00.000Z	Pc_Dark	wolferine	kinda
2007-09-15T06:34:00.000Z	Pc_Dark		I don't see an option though, in plain site
2007-09-15T06:34:00.000Z	wolferine	Pc_Dark	View maybe, as it relates to how you 'view' it ?
2007-09-15T06:35:00.000Z	Pc_Dark		Nope, no option there
2007-09-15T06:35:00.000Z	wolferine		its not rocket science :)
2007-09-15T06:35:00.000Z	wolferine		really, nothing at all in view?
2007-09-15T06:35:00.000Z	wolferine		hmm, I guess you have the version 0.0.0.1
2007-09-15T06:36:00.000Z	Pc_Dark		Meh, close works as long as I don't 'quit'

2007-09-15T06:38:00.000Z	Pc_Dark		It's very useful, and has a purpose
2007-09-15T06:38:00.000Z	Pc_Dark		So does Ubuntu.
2007-09-15T06:38:00.000Z	wolferine	Pc_Dark	sorry, looks like there isnt something to do that
