2010-06-18T12:11:00.000Z	ManDay		then ill use wireshark, thanks!
2010-06-18T12:11:00.000Z	ManDay		sure undecim
2010-06-18T12:12:00.000Z	ManDay		Its not apache - its the SAGE server backend
2010-06-18T12:14:00.000Z	ManDay		HermanDE, undecim just named that - sorry for reaksing - I thought wireshark was a general purpose sniffer
2010-06-18T12:14:00.000Z	ManDay		I thought there might be something dedicated to observer requests on HTTP (from one specific app)
2010-06-18T12:14:00.000Z	ManDay		ill get wireshark
2010-06-18T12:15:00.000Z	ManDay		HermanDE, installing as we speak
2010-06-18T12:15:00.000Z	AAA	ManDay	 are you familiar with packet analyzers? it is fairly complex stuff
2010-06-18T12:15:00.000Z	ManDay	AAA	im familar with networking and sniffing with little experience tho
2010-06-18T12:17:00.000Z	AAA	ManDay	 cool.
2010-06-18T12:18:00.000Z	AAA	ManDay	 you need libcap
2010-06-18T12:18:00.000Z	ManDay	AAA	libcap is there
2010-06-18T12:18:00.000Z	AAA	ManDay	 you started as root/sudo?
2010-06-18T12:19:00.000Z	ManDay	AAA	i would have expected it to go gksu
2010-06-18T12:19:00.000Z	AAA	ManDay	 same thing =p and it is needed for capture/promisc
2010-06-18T12:23:00.000Z	ManDay	AAA	HermanDE can you quickly tell me how to filter for port 8000 only?
2010-06-18T12:28:00.000Z	AAA	ManDay	 oh nm. you mean with ws. sorry
2010-06-18T12:33:00.000Z	AAA	ManDay	 you bet. read up on the docs. I highly recommend learning tcpdump to diag network foobars
2010-06-18T12:34:00.000Z	AAA	ManDay	 learning how tcpdump will make you and instant wireshard pro. promise
