2006-10-02T07:37:00.000Z	Sktfeelsdapper		i've put these in my repository list 3 times now, and none of them can either be found or updated.
2006-10-02T07:37:00.000Z	Sktfeelsdapper		well i just find it funny that it's on the stupid website, yet.
2006-10-02T07:37:00.000Z	Sktfeelsdapper		Oh wait a minute they aren't really there!
2006-10-02T07:38:00.000Z	Sktfeelsdapper		This is load of horse crap. The first minute I get my hands on a Windows Disc I'm going back.
2006-10-02T07:38:00.000Z	Sktfeelsdapper		This is retarded all the stupid crap you have to do.
2006-10-02T07:38:00.000Z	Sktfeelsdapper		I'm so frustrated my eye is twitching.
2006-10-02T07:38:00.000Z	Sktfeelsdapper		This isn't "linux for humans"
2006-10-02T07:39:00.000Z	Sktfeelsdapper		HA LINUX FOR HUMANS
2006-10-02T07:39:00.000Z	Sktfeelsdapper		The problem is, is that I"m having the most impossible frustrating time in the world and nobody can help me.
2006-10-02T07:39:00.000Z	mister_roboto	Sktfeelsdapper	well it's not for everyone <shrug>  it's ok if you go back to windows, really!
2006-10-02T07:41:00.000Z	mister_roboto	Sktfeelsdapper	what do you mean no support for compiling?
2006-10-02T07:42:00.000Z	mister_roboto	Sktfeelsdapper	do you know anything about programming? the reason i ask is people who don't frequently have a LOT of difficulty with compiling
2006-10-02T07:43:00.000Z	mister_roboto	Sktfeelsdapper	actually, qmake and cvs don't compile anything, you need gcc too :)
2006-10-02T07:44:00.000Z	mister_roboto	Sktfeelsdapper	you're well on your way then :)
2006-10-02T07:45:00.000Z	mister_roboto	Sktfeelsdapper	just ask one more time about your compile problem
2006-10-02T07:48:00.000Z	mister_roboto	Sktfeelsdapper	you're not asking your question, just bitching
2006-10-02T07:49:00.000Z	mister_roboto	Sktfeelsdapper	depends on what you're trying to do. most oss packages have a configure script and you just "configure && make && sudo make instal l"
2006-10-02T07:50:00.000Z	mister_roboto	Sktfeelsdapper	do what people are telling you and tell them the EXACT error if you get one
