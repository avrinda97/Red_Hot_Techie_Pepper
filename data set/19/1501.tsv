2011-03-10T18:26:00.000Z	airtonix	sre-su	are you sure? most kde apps store config in ~/.config or ~/.local, where as most gnome strict applications store config in either gconf or ~/.gnome2
2011-03-10T18:27:00.000Z	airtonix	sre-su	you might even find that some gtk applications store their config in ~/.config
2011-03-10T18:28:00.000Z	sre-su	airtonix	I'm searching for settings stored by gworldclock
2011-03-10T18:29:00.000Z	airtonix	sre-su	i'd try : locate gworldclock | grep /home/$USER
2011-03-10T18:30:00.000Z	airtonix	sre-su	if it's too much output then pipe it through less: locate gworldclock | grep /home/$USER | less

2011-03-10T18:32:00.000Z	airtonix	sre-su	have you looked at the manpage for the program?
2011-03-10T18:33:00.000Z	sre-su	airtonix	Yes, nothing useful in it to be used for my current need
