2009-11-30T21:02:00.000Z	epinky	EMKO	are you using generic kernel?  if so, try with "sudo apt-get install linux-backports-modules-wireless-karmic-generic"
2009-11-30T21:03:00.000Z	EMKO	epinky	what will this do?
2009-11-30T21:04:00.000Z	epinky	EMKO	That module contains all the cutting edge wireless drivers for Ubuntu Karmic from the testing repositories which haven’t yet been officially released, hope it could help
2009-11-30T21:04:00.000Z	EMKO	epinky	ok i will install that is there something i must do after i install that?
2009-11-30T21:06:00.000Z	epinky	EMKO	not really, just Open up “Software Sources” and browse to the “Updates” tab, make sure the karmic-backports option is ticked
2009-11-30T21:06:00.000Z	EMKO	epinky	i have only ssh :( just apt-get update and upgrade?
2009-11-30T21:08:00.000Z	epinky	EMKO	:( you'll have to enable that locally(I mean you'll need to do that on the computer that is having that wireless problem)

2009-11-30T21:11:00.000Z	epinky	EMKO	it has to look this way, check the backports section: http://www.flickr.com/photos/jonolumb/4112112734/
2009-11-30T21:13:00.000Z	EMKO	epinky	i dont have a graphic interface i just have a terminal  i will try reboot to see if its working now
2009-11-30T21:23:00.000Z	EMKO		once i run sudo apt-get install linux-backports-modules-wireless-karmic-generic  does that install the latest wireless drivers?
2009-11-30T21:32:00.000Z	EMKO		once i run sudo apt-get install linux-backports-modules-wireless-karmic-generic does that automaticly install the latest wireless drivers?
2009-11-30T21:34:00.000Z	epinky	EMKO	it will install wireless drivers for Ubuntu Karmic which haven’t yet been officially released
2009-11-30T21:35:00.000Z	EMKO	epinky	i know but what i dont understand is once i run the apt-get install does that install the drivers and i have nothing els to do? because u showed me something wich i cant do i have only a terminal to type commands
2009-11-30T21:35:00.000Z	EMKO	epinky	is there a way to check what my wifi is using for the driver version?
2009-11-30T21:43:00.000Z	epinky	EMKO	version information for each MadWifi module is sent to the system log when  the modules are loaded. You can check that log with "dmesg" and "lsmod", for example.
2009-11-30T21:44:00.000Z	EMKO	epinky	im using ath5k not madwifi since madwifi is not used anymore
2009-11-30T21:45:00.000Z	epinky	EMKO	ath5k well is was formerly known as madwifi, sorry if I sounded "old"
