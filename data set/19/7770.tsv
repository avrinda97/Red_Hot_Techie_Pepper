2007-07-04T14:48:00.000Z	Jamesinator		I don't think you get what I'm saying. I already know that Ubuntu is easy, but that's not what I asked. I asked if anyone could suggest any good addons that would make it easier for a Windows user to switch to, such as themes / etc. I'd much rather you tried to answer my question rather than telling me something irrelevant, although I appreciate your input.
2007-07-04T14:50:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Jamesinator	how would you make it easier for a Windows user to switch to Ubuntu?
2007-08-27T15:01:00.000Z	Jamesinator	gordonjcp	Some of us have network security issues
2007-08-27T15:01:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Jamesinator	such as?
2007-08-27T15:03:00.000Z	Jamesinator	gordonjcp	Has access control occurred to you? If I start a service, I don't necessarily want anyone anywhere to be able to use it.
2007-08-27T15:04:00.000Z	Jamesinator	gordonjcp	It also has potential for multi user environments by limiting external and internal port access, like blocking IRC ports when 8 year old cousins are around. ;)
2007-08-27T15:05:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Jamesinator	if you start the service, then configure the service correctly
2007-08-27T15:05:00.000Z	Jamesinator	gordonjcp	Not every service is the same or is configurable with ACL settings. Squid? No problem. Tor? Not so much.
2007-08-27T15:06:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Jamesinator	use a proper firewall then
2007-08-27T15:06:00.000Z	Jamesinator	gordonjcp	That's an unfair rationalization -- just because it's simple doesn't mean it isn't effective. Firestarter is simply a GUI for iptables rulesets.
2007-08-27T15:07:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Jamesinator	and therefore broken by design
2007-08-27T15:07:00.000Z	Jamesinator	gordonjcp	If you have a problem with iptables, then don't use it.
2007-08-27T15:08:00.000Z	Jamesinator	gordonjcp	The GUI is designed to be more of a configuration utility, not a service itself
2007-08-27T15:08:00.000Z	Jamesinator	gordonjcp	Unless I misunderstood your last message
2007-08-27T15:10:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Jamesinator	yah, so there's not a lot of point of running firestarter at startup
2007-08-27T15:10:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Jamesinator	'cos it only configures iptables for you
2007-08-27T15:11:00.000Z	Jamesinator	gordonjcp	Of course there isn't a lot of point, but I'm in here to help people with their problems, not tell them how to run their box
2007-08-27T15:11:00.000Z	Jamesinator	gordonjcp	Although some people use it since it does list diagnostic information like amount of data transmitted and what it considers high-security attacks it's blocked
2007-08-27T15:11:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Jamesinator	fair point
