2005-04-20T09:54:00.000Z	Dreamer32	memnoc	fix my video and you can have it :)
2005-04-20T09:54:00.000Z	memnoc	Dreamer32	what exactly is the problem?
2005-04-20T09:55:00.000Z	Dreamer32	memnoc	nvidia binary driver (gforce 4 440mx) and once I start X i can never return to console (not by existing, not by VT switching) without rebooting... doing so just gives me a blinking LCD, like it's in power save mode
2005-04-20T09:55:00.000Z	Dreamer32	memnoc	not a lockup at all, since i can restart X by typing startx or up-enter...
2005-04-20T09:56:00.000Z	Dreamer32	memnoc	but it would be nice to be able to return to console
2005-04-20T09:56:00.000Z	Dreamer32	memnoc	i don't have the problem with the nv driver
2005-04-20T09:56:00.000Z	memnoc	Dreamer32	hmm did you apt-get the drivers?
2005-04-20T09:56:00.000Z	Dreamer32	memnoc	yes, i'm using nvidia-glx from apt
2005-04-20T09:57:00.000Z	memnoc	Dreamer32	have you followed the instructions on http://www.ubuntuguide.org/#installnvidiadriver ?
2005-04-20T09:57:00.000Z	Dreamer32	memnoc	let me check :)
2005-04-20T09:58:00.000Z	memnoc	Dreamer32	otherwise, i'm not sure how to help you.. i'm using a GF4MX420 myself, and haven't noticed any problems whatsoever..
2005-04-20T09:59:00.000Z	Dreamer32	memnoc	yes, i followed those directions... and the new driver itself works great, just I can't leave X :)
2005-04-20T09:59:00.000Z	Dreamer32	memnoc	maybe updating to hoary release will fix it, but i'm not holding my breath
2005-04-20T10:00:00.000Z	memnoc	Dreamer32	damn, like i said, i don't even know where to start.. i'm an amateur at all this, and if something doesn't work i google it and get in here.. :)
2005-04-20T10:00:00.000Z	memnoc	Dreamer32	yea, give it a shot.. doesn't hurt
2005-04-20T10:01:00.000Z	Dreamer32	memnoc	i'm closer to an expert (at least than I am to beginner) and this is why linux still isn't ready for the desktop, it just doesn't always work :)
2005-04-20T10:01:00.000Z	Dreamer32	memnoc	not that windows does either, but windows usually works for a while, then craps out... linux either works forever, or doesn't work forever from the get-go :)
2005-04-20T10:02:00.000Z	Dreamer32	memnoc	i mean i suppose some windows users wouldn't never miss a text-only console though, so maybe it isn't THAT bad :)
2005-04-20T10:03:00.000Z	memnoc	Dreamer32	hehe yea, i know what you mean.. i think the problem relies in that there's sooo many options to chose from, and somehow they all have to be compatible with eachother.. it's crazy really, but they've done it to a great extent..
