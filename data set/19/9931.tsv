2006-08-25T16:52:00.000Z	ISOLATEDViRuS_		how do i change the permissions on a directory?
2006-08-25T16:52:00.000Z	FRET	ISOLATEDViRuS_	chmod, can also be done recursivly
2006-08-25T16:55:00.000Z	FRET	ISOLATEDViRuS_	man chmod
2006-08-25T16:56:00.000Z	FRET	ISOLATEDViRuS_	ask wikipedia
2006-08-25T16:59:00.000Z	FRET	ISOLATEDViRuS_	that is a VERY bad idea. Why do you want that?
2006-08-25T05:01:00.000Z	FRET	ISOLATEDViRuS_	even then it's a bad idea. and you need to be root for that I guess. Unless the drive is mounted, then you have to do that with mount-options
2006-08-25T05:03:00.000Z	FRET	ISOLATEDViRuS_	that's what debuntu said before....you only NEED read-access
2006-08-25T05:04:00.000Z	FRET	ISOLATEDViRuS_	change the permissions with mount-options.
2006-08-25T05:04:00.000Z	FRET	ISOLATEDViRuS_	read manpages or some basic linux book
2006-08-25T05:10:00.000Z	FRET	ISOLATEDViRuS_	so it was mounted automatically, and you cannot delete any folders?
2006-08-25T05:10:00.000Z	ISOLATEDViRuS_	FRET	true story.
2006-08-25T05:10:00.000Z	FRET	ISOLATEDViRuS_	how did you try to delete something?
2006-08-25T05:11:00.000Z	FRET	ISOLATEDViRuS_	since when are you using linux, and have you read book on it?
2006-08-25T05:13:00.000Z	FRET	ISOLATEDViRuS_	you can delete folders with nautilus ("the gui")?
2006-08-25T05:19:00.000Z	FRET	ISOLATEDViRuS_	and read some book about linux. There are good ones available online for free
2006-08-25T05:20:00.000Z	ISOLATEDViRuS_	FRET	books come after my system is up and running in place of my old windows one.
2006-08-25T05:20:00.000Z	FRET	ISOLATEDViRuS_	that's not logical... First read, then do.
2006-08-25T05:20:00.000Z	FRET	ISOLATEDViRuS_	sounds more logical to me
2006-08-25T05:22:00.000Z	FRET	ISOLATEDViRuS_	right
