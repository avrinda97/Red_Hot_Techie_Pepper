2008-02-19T00:19:00.000Z	kex		hey, my friend just installed xubuntu, and when she does "sudo apt-get update" she gets a segmentation fault
2008-02-19T00:20:00.000Z	kex		since i am not a ubuntu user i'd love some help
2008-02-19T00:21:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	kex	any specific error message?
2008-02-19T00:21:00.000Z	kex	Odd-rationale	segmentation fault?
2008-02-19T00:22:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	kex	OK. Never heard of that one. Sorry.
2008-02-19T00:22:00.000Z	kex	Odd-rationale	that is what she said from the phone to me
2008-02-19T00:23:00.000Z	kex	Odd-rationale	and from what i know it is a clean xubuntu installation
2008-02-19T00:24:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	kex	Has she tried aptitude? (running out of ideas)
2008-02-19T00:25:00.000Z	kex	Odd-rationale	no, but i never used that either, should a reinstall fix it?
2008-02-19T00:26:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	kex	maybe. but try <<sudo aptitude update && sudo aptitude safe-upgrade>> first
2008-02-19T00:27:00.000Z	kex	Odd-rationale	safe upgrade? what does that do?
2008-02-19T00:27:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	kex	The aptitude version of upgrade...
2008-02-19T00:27:00.000Z	kex	Odd-rationale	ok
2008-02-19T00:28:00.000Z	kex	Odd-rationale	ok
2008-02-19T00:29:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	kex	Did it work?
2008-02-19T00:30:00.000Z	kex	Odd-rationale	i still have to call her
2008-02-19T00:30:00.000Z	kex	Odd-rationale	still thinking of a reinstall is easier for her
2008-02-19T00:31:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	kex	OK. If that doesn't work, I really don't have any more ideas. Tell her to try the forums and post the complete error message.
2008-02-19T00:31:00.000Z	kex	Odd-rationale	well that is what she told me :s
