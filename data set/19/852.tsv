2011-11-14T07:17:00.000Z	ghostnik11		hi i am on ubuntu 11.10 and when i move to trash items on a sd card and then tell ubuntu to eject media, it doesn't delete the files before ejecting the sd card like it use to do in 11.04
2011-11-14T07:17:00.000Z	ghostnik11		how can i get ubuntu 11.10 to delete the files from an sd card when i tell it to eject the sd card
2011-11-14T07:17:00.000Z	urlin2u	ghostnik11	you can bypass the trash to a straight delete if you want.
2011-11-14T07:19:00.000Z	ghostnik11	urlin2u	 yeah but the thing is i have already told it to remove the items to trash and now when i load the sd card it loads up with the items not there but the sd card is still full when i check the properties it still shows the sd card being full even though i deleted some stuff off it
2011-11-14T07:20:00.000Z	urlin2u	ghostnik11	the sd card is a plugin right, it has its opwn trash hidden.
2011-11-14T07:20:00.000Z	ghostnik11	urlin2u	never seen that will look now for its own trash bin
2011-11-14T07:21:00.000Z	urlin2u	ghostnik11	hit crtl-h for hiddden
2011-11-14T07:23:00.000Z	ghostnik11	urlin2u	your exactly correct it was hidden can i just delete them by selecting all the files in the trash folder
2011-11-14T07:23:00.000Z	urlin2u	ghostnik11	should be able to sometimes it is locked so you would just gksudo nautilus to get to it.
2011-11-14T07:25:00.000Z	ghostnik11	urlin2u	b/4 u said i could bypass the way to delete the files without sending them to trash, how can i do that b/c when i select all it only gives me an option of move to trash no delete
2011-11-14T07:25:00.000Z	ghostnik11	urlin2u	or permanent delete
2011-11-14T07:25:00.000Z	urlin2u	ghostnik11	I set my preferences in nautilus to have a bypass of trash I never use it.
2011-11-14T07:26:00.000Z	urlin2u	ghostnik11	you still have a choice of trash or delete that way
2011-11-14T07:47:00.000Z	ghostnik11	urlin2u	what did you change in dconf editor to enable the delete option and move to trash option?
2011-11-14T07:48:00.000Z	ghostnik11	urlin2u	never mind found it enable-delete thanks for the help bro
2011-11-14T07:48:00.000Z	urlin2u	ghostnik11	I did it it nautilus-edit-preferences-behavior  nautilus is home
2011-11-14T07:50:00.000Z	urlin2u	ghostnik11	well more then home but you get the meaning.
2011-11-14T07:50:00.000Z	ghostnik11	urlin2u	yeah but thanks again
2011-11-14T07:50:00.000Z	urlin2u	ghostnik11	no problem >:D
