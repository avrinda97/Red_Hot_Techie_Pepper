2006-09-11T16:07:00.000Z	thephunkizm		when i use the mkdir command in Ubuntu 6.06 amd64, it returns 'permission denied'.  how do i gain permission?
2006-09-11T16:08:00.000Z	CalJohn	thephunkizm	directories have "permissions".  you need to have permission to write to area's with retricted permissions
2006-09-11T16:09:00.000Z	CalJohn	thephunkizm	read up on chmod/chown
2006-09-11T16:09:00.000Z	thephunkizm		ok cal, thanks.
2006-09-11T16:11:00.000Z	thephunkizm	CalJohn	the reason I asked was that before I was told to read https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FirefoxAMD64FlashJava by someone in here.  The tutorial is nice, but it makes it look like i don't need to do anything but their step-by-step procedure...
2006-09-11T16:12:00.000Z	thephunkizm		whoa
2006-09-11T16:12:00.000Z	CalJohn	thephunkizm	i just recomended taking the wine approach with erider a minute ago.  i don't want to spam this channel by repeating, so just read your log :)
2006-09-11T16:13:00.000Z	CalJohn	thephunkizm	wait, why doesn't it look like you have anything to do?
2006-09-11T16:14:00.000Z	thephunkizm		because it's a simple 1-2-3-4 step by step tutorial.  wouldn't it mention chmod/chown if i had to do that?
2006-09-11T16:15:00.000Z	thephunkizm	CalJohn	btw, i'm sorry but it looks like i was a little late for the conversation with erider
2006-09-11T16:16:00.000Z	CalJohn	thephunkizm	why doesn't it look like you have anything to do according the howto?
2006-09-11T16:17:00.000Z	thephunkizm	CalJohn	i'm not quite sure what you mean by that.  i followed the steps of the how-to up until the 'mkdir' line and got stuck..
2006-09-11T16:17:00.000Z	CalJohn		are you root?
2006-09-11T16:18:00.000Z	CalJohn	thephunkizm	sudo su
2006-09-11T16:18:00.000Z	thephunkizm		ahhh sweet!!
2006-09-11T16:18:00.000Z	thephunkizm	CalJohn	 thank you!  i was trying su (without sudo) and it was denying me
2006-09-11T16:19:00.000Z	CalJohn	thephunkizm	hehe little things make a big difference :)
2006-09-11T16:19:00.000Z	CalJohn	thephunkizm	ubuntu doesn't configure su as you would expect by default.  they all like sudo.  freaks.
2006-09-11T16:20:00.000Z	thephunkizm	CalJohn	good to know.  thanks a million =)
