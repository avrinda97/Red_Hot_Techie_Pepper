2004-11-10T11:40:00.000Z	ThreeDayMonk		I have Ubuntu running on a triple-head desktop :-)
2004-11-10T11:40:00.000Z	ThreeDayMonk		but I despise l337 posturing that holds that editing a config file is a good thing.  It's not
2004-11-10T11:41:00.000Z	ThreeDayMonk		(on AGP)
2004-11-10T11:43:00.000Z	ThreeDayMonk		*shouldn't be
2004-11-10T11:44:00.000Z	ThreeDayMonk		that's a very elitist attitude
2004-11-10T11:45:00.000Z	stvn	ThreeDayMonk	if you want a tweaked system you need to be able to edit text files, just like you need to be able to mess around in regedit for windows, other than that modern distros work quite well for ppl who don't want to edit text files
2004-11-10T11:46:00.000Z	ThreeDayMonk	stvn	I'll agree that it's getting better, but it's not there yet - and it's this kind of attitude that holds back progress in usability
2004-11-10T11:47:00.000Z	stvn	ThreeDayMonk	I agree, but it's not just linux devs (or mostly users) who are holding it back
2004-11-10T11:52:00.000Z	stvn	ThreeDayMonk	the main problem with linux still is instalation, you might run in not/badly supported hardware, but once it's up and running it's fine, housemates run it here without a problem and they're not interested in how it works, just that it works
2004-11-10T11:53:00.000Z	ThreeDayMonk	stvn	you're right there - it's just that the range of tasks that can be achieved by a default installation is limited
2004-11-10T11:53:00.000Z	stvn	ThreeDayMonk	maybe so, but synaptic helps a long way there ;)
2004-11-10T11:54:00.000Z	ThreeDayMonk	stvn	yeah, synaptic is nice - but so many things still need google and a tweak
2004-11-10T12:02:00.000Z	ThreeDayMonk	stvn	chinese characters aren't so hard
2004-11-10T12:03:00.000Z	stvn	ThreeDayMonk	there are just so many of them
2004-11-10T12:03:00.000Z	ThreeDayMonk	stvn	yeah, but a few thousand get you a long way - and they are spelled from about 200-odd radicals
2004-11-10T12:04:00.000Z	stvn	ThreeDayMonk	it took me several years to be able to properly read and write dutch and that only has 26 characters, imagine learning the odd 1000 chinese ;)
2004-11-10T12:04:00.000Z	ThreeDayMonk	stvn	dutch is hard because the orthography is very different to other european languages
2004-11-10T12:05:00.000Z	stvn	ThreeDayMonk	I don't know that word but I know dutch is strange and difficult
2004-11-10T12:10:00.000Z	stvn	ThreeDayMonk	lol
