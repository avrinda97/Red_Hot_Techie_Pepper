2010-06-01T08:24:00.000Z	jannon		Does anyone know how to get wireless internet working with Feisty Fawn on a Mac? (i need wireless 'net to get a newer distro). It's not dual-booted
2010-06-01T08:24:00.000Z	edbian	jannon	Why are you using such an old version?
2010-06-01T08:24:00.000Z	edbian	jannon	oops sorry. Didn't see that you need wifi to get a newer distro
2010-06-01T08:25:00.000Z	jannon	edbian	yep :)
2010-06-01T08:25:00.000Z	edbian	jannon	does your wireless card show up in the output of sudo ifconfig -a ??
2010-06-01T08:26:00.000Z	jannon	edbian	no
2010-06-01T08:27:00.000Z	edbian	jannon	does it show up in the ouput of sudo lspci -k  ??
2010-06-01T08:29:00.000Z	jannon	edbian	the "-k" part doesn't work, i'm not sure?
2010-06-01T08:29:00.000Z	edbian	jannon	sudo lspci
2010-06-01T08:29:00.000Z	edbian	jannon	Old version of the software ;)

2010-06-01T08:32:00.000Z	edbian	jannon	That's it.
2010-06-01T08:32:00.000Z	edbian	jannon	You're in deep.  The system doesn't even know what the card is.  I found this guide after a quick googling.  http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=512828
2010-06-01T08:33:00.000Z	edbian	jannon	I suggest though that you just get your hands on a 10.04 live CD somewhere.  You're going to be spending a long time upgrading through the versions.  Fiesty is 7.04, you have to upgrade 1 distro at a time.  7.10, 8.04, 8.10, 9.04, 9.10, 10.04  Each one is going to download 600 MB of stuff and possibly break things.
2010-06-01T08:34:00.000Z	jannon	edbian	i'm trying to download the 10.04 live cd, but it's going to take too long on my ethernet connection so i need to get wireless working so i can "borrow" a neighbor's much faster connection...
2010-06-01T08:35:00.000Z	edbian	jannon	Try following the guide
2010-06-01T08:35:00.000Z	edbian	jannon	That's my only advice.  Good long!
2010-06-01T08:35:00.000Z	edbian	jannon	I offer a bit of warning: it's going to be really hard to do.
