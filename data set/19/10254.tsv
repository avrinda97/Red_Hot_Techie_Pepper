2006-07-07T16:07:00.000Z	Warbo	greddy	That will be in the "modules" section (and it is "dri" not "drv")
2006-07-07T16:09:00.000Z	Warbo	greddy	For fglrx and nvidia yes
2006-07-07T16:45:00.000Z	Warbo	greddy	That is a line that you put in a text file
2006-07-07T16:46:00.000Z	Warbo	greddy	"sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list" that is the file to put it in
2006-07-07T16:47:00.000Z	greddy	Warbo	what do i do with this? just paste in that line?

2006-07-07T16:48:00.000Z	Warbo	greddy	"sudo apt-get update" and the packages will be available

2006-08-09T05:48:00.000Z	Warbo	greddy	you need to use sudo make install, but I would prefer checkinstall
