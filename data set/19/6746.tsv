2008-03-11T11:48:00.000Z	quicksilver_		Hello, does anybody have a few minutes to help me with what I think is an xorg.conf issue?
2008-03-11T11:50:00.000Z	quicksilver_		Ive just installed ubuntu 7.10, did all the updates, am using the restricted nvidia drivers, and made my second screen a 'twin view'.... But as soon as I saved the changes to xorg.conf and rebooted, my system halts on boot until I hit 'ctrl+alt+del'... It then boots into Gnome, but it didnt mount my other 2 drives as it had before... Any ideas? Im thinking taking xorg.conf back will do the trick.
2008-03-11T11:51:00.000Z	coz_	quicksilver_	did you try writing to xorg from nvidia settings?
2008-03-11T11:51:00.000Z	quicksilver_	coz_	Yeah, thats how I made it the twin view in the first place.
2008-03-11T11:52:00.000Z	quicksilver_	coz_	I think thats how this problem started.
2008-03-11T11:52:00.000Z	coz_	quicksilver_	I have never had luck with nvidia settings writing to xorg  but then I always  enable twinview manually after logging in just incase I have an application or game that doesn like twinview
2008-03-11T11:52:00.000Z	coz_	quicksilver_	I prefer haveing choices
2008-03-11T11:53:00.000Z	quicksilver_	coz_	So any ideas on how to take it back to how I had it before?
2008-03-11T11:54:00.000Z	coz_	quicksilver_	did you check in the xorg.conf to see if indeed nvidia wrote anything there?
2008-03-11T11:55:00.000Z	quicksilver_	coz_	I see that there is a .backup file, but Im not sure if I should try to rename it..... The backup file is also made by nvidia settings.
2008-03-11T11:55:00.000Z	coz_	quicksilver_	you could try a sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg  as a last resort  but check again in xorg to see what was changes first
2008-03-11T11:56:00.000Z	quicksilver_	coz_	what does that do? Im really new to xorg.conf, and I dont think I could notice what changed.
2008-03-11T11:57:00.000Z	coz_	quicksilver_	ok  go to http://pastebin.ca   paste the contents of /etc/ X11/xorg.conf   hit the submit button and paste the link it gives you here
2008-03-11T11:58:00.000Z	quicksilver_	coz_	http://pastebin.ca/937862
2008-03-11T11:58:00.000Z	coz_	quicksilver_	ok looking hold on
2008-03-11T12:02:00.000Z	coz_	quicksilver_	 well it looks like nvidia settings indeed wrote to the xorg  in the last section  Section "Screen"  you can most likely comment that section with #  and restart x  to see if it goes to normal single monitor use  if not you wil have to remove the   #  you place there in text console if it doesn boot and y ou do that with  sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf     do you know how to do t hat/
2008-03-11T12:03:00.000Z	quicksilver_	coz_	Yeah, I can do that.
2008-03-11T12:03:00.000Z	coz_	quicksilver_	you know how to do the nano  in text console?
2008-03-11T12:04:00.000Z	coz_	quicksilver_	ok just go slow with it and test that commented section to see if that works
