2006-06-29T09:14:00.000Z	snoops		oh, whoops.. other way around I see..
2006-06-29T09:14:00.000Z	snoops	majd	if you smb://macsip/sharedfolder do you get anything?
2006-06-29T09:15:00.000Z	majd	snoops	by going to Places>Connect to Server then choosing windows share
2006-06-29T09:15:00.000Z	majd		right?
2006-06-29T09:16:00.000Z	snoops	majd	that's one way, yeah

2006-06-29T09:16:00.000Z	snoops		could be a permissions prob?
2006-06-29T09:16:00.000Z	majd		pretty sure i have everything setup right on my mac cause i can access the mac files between my mac computers
2006-06-29T09:17:00.000Z	majd	snoops	is there a way to authenticate myself when making the connection?
2006-06-29T09:18:00.000Z	snoops	majd	you know the name of one of the folders you've shared on the mac right? Let's try actually mounting it for fun
2006-06-29T09:20:00.000Z	snoops	majd	so umm in terminal "sudo apt-get install smbfs" (unless you've already got it installed).. then you'll want to do "sudo mkdir /media/MacShared" then "sudo mount -t smbfs //ipofmac/themacssharedfolder /media/MacShared -o username=puttheusernamehere,password=putthepasswordhere"
