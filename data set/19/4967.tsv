2008-10-03T10:18:00.000Z	passive		I've screwed gnome when i deleted xorg.conf i can't get it back working
2008-10-03T10:18:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	passive	are you in Gnome now?
2008-10-03T10:34:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	passive	hummmmmm
2008-10-03T10:19:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	passive	hummmmmm   so either gnome is buggered up or X is?
2008-10-03T10:21:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	passive	 I guess deleting the  hidden  .gnome folders in your home folder should take care of it,  but if you can't log in well  you need to do it in the Ubuntu console or from Live CD
2008-10-03T10:21:00.000Z	passive	SebNaitsabes	i'll give it a shot and come back. Thanks alot!
2008-10-03T10:22:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	passive	 you don't have Kubuntu or antyhing like that installed?
2008-10-03T10:22:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	passive	 no other desktop environment or window manager?
2008-10-03T10:22:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	passive	ok well can you log into KDE4
2008-10-03T10:22:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	passive	 ok your issue has nothing to do with X
2008-10-03T10:23:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	passive	 you won't need Live CD to fix it, since you can log into KDE4
2008-10-03T10:23:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	passive	maybe your in KDE4 right now?
2008-10-03T10:23:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	passive	 well  user settings for all programs go in home in hidden .folders so  deleting any folders to do with gnome should probably take care of it
2008-10-03T10:26:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	passive	 yep get rid of them all
2008-10-03T10:27:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	passive	   just type  name:  message
