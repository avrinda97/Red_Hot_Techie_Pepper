2010-08-12T12:53:00.000Z	kiamo		are emerald themes known for causing gnome to freeze?
2010-08-12T12:53:00.000Z	littlepenguin	kiamo	check kernel.log for reason of freeze maybe something is in there
2010-08-12T12:54:00.000Z	kiamo	littlepenguin	will do :) thanks
2010-08-12T12:54:00.000Z	kiamo	littlepenguin	kern.log or .log.1
2010-08-12T12:54:00.000Z	kiamo	littlepenguin	i just did a forced reboot
2010-08-12T13:02:00.000Z	littlepenguin	kiamo	yes its possible because when your system freezes it wont be able to write entries in log
2010-08-12T13:06:00.000Z	littlepenguin	kiamo	when using metacity does it occur also?
2010-08-12T13:13:00.000Z	littlepenguin	kiamo	you could install fusion-icon..with it you get a tray icon to change between the window managers
2010-08-12T13:35:00.000Z	littlepenguin	kiamo	...that is difficult now..could be a hardware or software issue
