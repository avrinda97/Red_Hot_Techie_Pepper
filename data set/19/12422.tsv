2005-12-09T15:38:00.000Z	opnsrc		When I browse folders, there is no address bar where I can type where I want to go and copy the address of the folder
2005-12-09T15:39:00.000Z	opnsrc		How do I put one there, I see no option for it
2005-12-09T15:39:00.000Z	opnsrc		?
2005-12-09T15:40:00.000Z	opnsrc		oh thanks
2005-12-09T15:41:00.000Z	opnsrc		I still don't see an option to do that
2005-12-09T15:41:00.000Z	opnsrc		For an address bar
2005-12-09T15:42:00.000Z	opnsrc		Is there something I can install that puts an address bar?
2005-12-09T15:43:00.000Z	opnsrc		Yeah, of the folder I'm in
2005-12-09T15:43:00.000Z	opnsrc		so if I were in /lib it'll show /lib and I can type /lib/mount and it'll move to that folder
2005-12-09T15:44:00.000Z	opnsrc		and then if I were to open a random folder I can copy and paste it somewhere else (IE: the search field and search for stuff in it)
2005-12-09T15:44:00.000Z	omp	opnsrc	in nautilus?
2005-12-09T15:45:00.000Z	omp	opnsrc	you want this in GNOME's file manager, correct? :p
2005-12-09T15:45:00.000Z	omp	opnsrc	do you have ubuntu or kubuntu?
2005-12-09T15:46:00.000Z	omp	opnsrc	it's in the gnome main menu somewhere, should be called Configuration Editor
2005-12-09T15:47:00.000Z	omp	opnsrc	after opening the configuration editor, go to applications >> nautilus, and it's somewhere in there
2005-12-09T15:47:00.000Z	omp	opnsrc	i would check, but i'm not using GNOME :p
2005-12-09T15:49:00.000Z	omp	opnsrc	did you find it, cause i can give the instructions in more detail now? :p
2005-12-09T15:49:00.000Z	omp	opnsrc	i think it's in preferences
2005-12-09T15:50:00.000Z	omp	opnsrc	always use location entry or something like that
