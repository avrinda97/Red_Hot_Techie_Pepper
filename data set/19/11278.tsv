2006-03-27T06:46:00.000Z	Healot	maria	its "mplayer-586", not "mplayer-386"
2006-03-27T06:46:00.000Z	maria	Healot	thanks, whats the difference between 386, 586, 686, etc?
2006-03-27T06:47:00.000Z	maria	Healot	Package mplayer-586 is not available, but is referred to by another package.
2006-03-27T06:51:00.000Z	maria	Healot	ubuntu 5.10 on a p3 800
2006-03-27T06:48:00.000Z	Healot	maria	try to use "sudo apt-get install mplayer", lets see all the candidates available for mplayer
2006-03-27T06:48:00.000Z	maria	Healot	same error :(
2006-03-27T06:49:00.000Z	Healot	maria	do you just installed ubuntu?
2006-03-27T06:49:00.000Z	maria	Healot	yeah, maybe 1 hour ago
2006-03-27T06:49:00.000Z	maria	Healot	ive already enabled multiverse, and universe
2006-03-27T06:49:00.000Z	Healot	maria	did you do "apt-get update"?
2006-03-27T06:50:00.000Z	maria	Healot	yeah

2006-03-27T06:52:00.000Z	Healot	maria	do "apt-cache search mplayer" for me, see what its output

2006-03-27T06:56:00.000Z	maria	Healot	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/10603
2006-03-27T06:58:00.000Z	Healot	maria	there is no "mplayer" package in your system right now
2006-03-27T06:59:00.000Z	maria	Healot	all of them, i enabled the disabled ones in the settings, and then ticked all the repositories
2006-03-27T07:00:00.000Z	maria	Healot	i forgot to add multiverse to the universe repositories:)
