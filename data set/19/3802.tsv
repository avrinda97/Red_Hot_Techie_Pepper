2011-10-16T08:19:00.000Z	akira_		anyone know the terminal command to install wxcam? and must anything need to be installed beforehand?
2011-10-16T08:21:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	akira_	apt-getlol
2011-10-16T08:21:00.000Z	SolarisBoy		meh,,, typo
2011-10-16T08:22:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	akira_	apt-cache search <string> to look for the package you want (replacing string with the name of the pkg your looking for), sudo apt-get install <pkg>  to install the package. apt-get should handle any dependencies for you.
2011-10-16T08:22:00.000Z	akira_		you download the iso then put it on a standard 700meg blank cd- and use imgburn to mount the iso
2011-10-16T08:24:00.000Z	akira_		they purposely make ubuntu versions to fit on a 700meg disc ;P
2011-10-16T08:24:00.000Z	akira_		but its close i can understand -
2011-10-16T08:26:00.000Z	akira_	SolarisBoy	 by saying apt-get should handle any dependencies for you that means when i type sudo apt-get install <pkg> everything it needed would be downloaded and installed correct?
2011-10-16T08:27:00.000Z	SolarisBoy		yes
2011-10-16T08:27:00.000Z	akira_		and that would generally imply for anything i dl?
2011-10-16T08:27:00.000Z	SolarisBoy		in most cases yes
2011-10-16T08:28:00.000Z	akira_		so i wouldnt have to type update or whatever that command is first then install ?
2011-10-16T08:28:00.000Z	akira_		<<always confused
2011-10-16T08:28:00.000Z	SolarisBoy		its good to type update to have an update to date package list, or also if you specifically added or modified a repo
2011-10-16T08:29:00.000Z	SolarisBoy		brb
2011-10-16T08:29:00.000Z	akira_		ok ty
2011-10-16T08:39:00.000Z	akira_		solarisBoy: when i used your command apt cache search<pkg> what do you get when you have like 5 or 6 results? ranging from a tool to a tracker to dev gtk-dev etc
2011-10-16T08:40:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	akira_	your basically searching for a string, so the more accurate the string is the more accurate the results will be
2011-10-16T08:40:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	akira_	also there are description fields in the output
