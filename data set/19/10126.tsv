2010-02-13T15:45:00.000Z	Pure		Hey
2010-02-13T15:46:00.000Z	Pure		Does server take less space than client?
2010-02-13T15:46:00.000Z	Pure		I don't think I'll need to install client
2010-02-13T15:47:00.000Z	Pure		I'm planning on SSHing to it only
2010-02-13T15:47:00.000Z	Pure		Ubuntu
2010-02-13T15:47:00.000Z	Pure		How so?
2010-02-13T15:48:00.000Z	Pure		But, if I only plan to SSH to it, can I do away with clients features?
2010-02-13T15:50:00.000Z	Pure		This is confusing, is there any advantage of having one over the other?
2010-02-13T15:50:00.000Z	Pure		Ok
2010-02-13T15:51:00.000Z	Pure		Does this wubi work well?
2010-02-13T15:52:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Pure	better to use real partitions in the long run, plus  wubi can mess up oddly on people, when they uninstall it, that kind of thing
2010-02-13T15:53:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Pure	usueally people install from the desktop CD
2010-02-13T15:54:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Pure	also you can order offical CD's from Canonical for free, but might take 4 to 6 weeks before getting
2010-02-13T15:56:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Pure	sounds about right on 56k I think
2010-02-13T15:56:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Pure	so in that case,  may as well get the desktop
2010-02-13T15:57:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Pure	since then you can test your hardware  before installing Ubuntu
2010-02-13T15:57:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Pure	where as with the alternate you can't
2010-02-13T15:57:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Pure	Which are you getting?
2010-02-13T15:58:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Pure	Desktop ok good :)
