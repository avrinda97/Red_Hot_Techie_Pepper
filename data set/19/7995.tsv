2007-05-25T09:12:00.000Z	dedi		how can i check if i have kernel agp support and loaded?
2007-05-25T09:14:00.000Z	j_ack	dedi	lsmod | grep agp
2007-05-25T09:15:00.000Z	dedi	j_ack	thanks, then i dont have it loaded :(
2007-05-25T09:16:00.000Z	j_ack	dedi	thats my output , sis_agp                 9604  1
2007-05-25T09:16:00.000Z	j_ack		agpgart                35400  2 nvidia,sis_agp
2007-05-25T09:17:00.000Z	dedi	j_ack	do you know how to get agp support, agpart isnt in the kernel anymore (right?) and there isnt a loadable module for nfroce3 (only find via, intel and sis)
2007-05-25T09:18:00.000Z	j_ack	dedi	what is the name of youre card
2007-05-25T09:19:00.000Z	dedi	j_ack	its an ati x800 and ati removed the internal agp support
2007-05-25T09:19:00.000Z	dedi	j_ack	at kernel config i dont find any agp options at device / char / agp. only when using "search" in the kernel menu there are results which are not browsable. there is amd64 (agp) and agp on yes, but are they realy compiled then? (just doesnt look like)
2007-05-25T09:20:00.000Z	j_ack	dedi	sorry then i cant help, i have nvidia
2007-05-25T09:20:00.000Z	dedi	j_ack	i think the problem doesnt lie on the grafic card. have to handle this i think: [fglrx]  Internal AGP is not supported in 2.6 kernel
2007-05-25T09:31:00.000Z	j_ack	dedi	take a look in these dir, /lib/modules/2.6.20-15-generic/kernel/drivers/char/agp ,
2007-05-25T09:32:00.000Z	j_ack	dedi	are there any, or speceally your drivers
2007-05-25T09:33:00.000Z	dedi	j_ack	i already did, as said there are only sis via and intel modules
2007-05-25T09:34:00.000Z	j_ack	dedi	you use the 64bit-kernel, or the 32bit?
2007-05-25T09:36:00.000Z	j_ack	dedi	i have 11 drivers (agp) in this dir.
2007-05-25T09:36:00.000Z	dedi	j_ack	64bit. so its just not supported under 64bit?
2007-05-25T09:37:00.000Z	j_ack	dedi	ithink so, but i dont know
2007-05-25T09:37:00.000Z	dedi	j_ack	oh damn. thank you
