2007-10-20T10:13:00.000Z	hendrixski		is there a guide written yet for how to solve graphics card issues in Gutsy?
2007-10-20T10:14:00.000Z	hendrixski		because my graphics card seems to not be getting used. it's all going to the CPU.... how do I fix this?
2007-10-20T10:14:00.000Z	BlaenkDenum	hendrixski	get the drivers
2007-10-20T10:14:00.000Z	hendrixski	BlaenkDenum	how? when I click on system-->RestrictedDriversManager there's nothing there
2007-10-20T10:15:00.000Z	BlaenkDenum	hendrixski	do you know what brand your video card is?
2007-10-20T10:15:00.000Z	hendrixski	BlaenkDenum	ATI mobility radeon 7500
2007-10-20T10:15:00.000Z	BlaenkDenum	hendrixski	hmm, I'm not so sure buddy
2007-10-20T10:16:00.000Z	hendrixski	BlaenkDenum	k, I'll check that one out.
2007-10-20T10:19:00.000Z	hendrixski	BlaenkDenum	k, yeah, those links said to go to the restricted drivers manager and select ATI... which isn't an option in my checkbox
2007-10-20T10:19:00.000Z	BlaenkDenum	hendrixski	it doesn't show a terminal method?
2007-10-20T10:20:00.000Z	BlaenkDenum	hendrixski	could you link me?
2007-10-20T10:20:00.000Z	hendrixski	BlaenkDenum	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI
2007-10-20T10:20:00.000Z	BlaenkDenum	hendrixski	just follow the instructions for feisty
2007-10-20T10:21:00.000Z	BlaenkDenum	hendrixski	be sure to stop when it starts giving instructions on how to do it for edgy haha
2007-10-20T10:21:00.000Z	hendrixski	BlaenkDenum	alrighty, not sure how compatible the feisty and edgy things are
2007-10-20T10:21:00.000Z	BlaenkDenum	hendrixski	it's not that, it's just a terminal method
2007-10-20T10:21:00.000Z	BlaenkDenum	hendrixski	so the same applies, it's not that you're actually running a feisty program on gutsy
2007-10-20T10:22:00.000Z	BlaenkDenum	hendrixski	it's just a different installation method
2007-10-20T10:22:00.000Z	BlaenkDenum	hendrixski	besides your card's kinda old :P
