2005-10-11T16:21:00.000Z	GDorn		anyone feel like helping me troubleshoot my sound card problem?  I can't get any sound system to work, and what I really want is alsa to work.
2005-10-11T16:23:00.000Z	amias	GDorn	tells us what card it is , which platform , which ubuntu you are using
2005-10-11T16:23:00.000Z	GDorn	amias	 turtle beach sound card, k7, and breezy.
2005-10-11T16:24:00.000Z	amias	GDorn	turtle beech use some quite unsual designs , which one is it ?
2005-10-11T16:25:00.000Z	GDorn	amias	 santa cruz.  it's listed, sorta, on the alsa hardware list
2005-10-11T16:25:00.000Z	amias	GDorn	does lscpi see it ?
2005-10-11T16:26:00.000Z	GDorn	amias	 yeah, it lists it as " Multimedia audio controller: Cirrus Logic CS 4614/22/24"
2005-10-11T16:26:00.000Z	amias	GDorn	how do you know its not working ?
2005-10-11T16:27:00.000Z	amias	GDorn	make sure its a wav file
2005-10-11T16:28:00.000Z	amias	GDorn	have you checked that the amp / headphones / speakers are working ok ?
2005-10-11T16:29:00.000Z	GDorn	amias	 they work when I boot to windows, yes.
2005-10-11T16:29:00.000Z	amias	GDorn	did it ever work or did it stop working ?
2005-10-11T16:29:00.000Z	GDorn	amias	 OSS worked, but only for one sound at a time.  I tried to install ALSA, and now both do not work.
2005-10-11T16:32:00.000Z	amias	GDorn	but you can still use alsamixer and the settings stick between invocations ?
2005-10-11T16:33:00.000Z	GDorn	amias	 I'm not sure what you mean.  everything stays the same way through reboots, yes.
2005-10-11T16:34:00.000Z	GDorn	amias	 okay, now my onboard sound card is working.  but the thing that selects which card to output on doesn't do anything.
2005-10-11T16:34:00.000Z	amias	GDorn	which thing ?
2005-10-11T16:34:00.000Z	GDorn	amias	 "Sound Preferences" in the System menu.
2005-10-11T16:35:00.000Z	GDorn	amias	 that setting is not sticking.  it shows both sound devices, lets me select either, but it always falls back to the onboard device.  I know I could disable it in the bios, but I'd actually like to have both cards working.
