2009-09-10T08:46:00.000Z	thirst		guys.. i connected my external USB to a mac and tried to format one partition .. but it blew away the entire partition table. :( I had 3 partitions first two of which I know the exact size, any way I can use fdisk to re create the partition table ?
2009-09-10T08:47:00.000Z	jjrev	thirst	yes, but you might loose your data...
2009-09-10T08:47:00.000Z	jjrev	thirst	have you already written data to the disk with the MAC?
2009-09-10T08:48:00.000Z	thirst	jjrev	what will cause me to loose data..
2009-09-10T08:48:00.000Z	thirst	jjrev	no. didnt write any data.. Mac data utility returned an error and exited within a second.. and the disk is untouched since..
2009-09-10T08:49:00.000Z	jjrev		alright, how did you partition the disk previously?
2009-09-10T08:49:00.000Z	thirst		in fact i tried to delete partition 2, it had no data.. I am interested only in partition 1(ntfs) and 3(ext3)
2009-09-10T08:49:00.000Z	thirst		I think i originally paritioned the disk on winXp
2009-09-10T08:50:00.000Z	thirst		I found one online resource here http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Partition/recovering.html but wanted  to know more details
2009-09-10T08:50:00.000Z	jjrev	thirst	well, as long as you do the same partitions as before (exactly the same) it should be ok
2009-09-10T08:51:00.000Z	jjrev	thirst	yeah, you're going to have to be a little creative when doing that.  you have to make sure they are exactly the same size,...
2009-09-10T08:52:00.000Z	thirst	jjrev	what are the reasons which will cause me to loose data even if I recreate the parition table with the exact same size
2009-09-10T08:52:00.000Z	thirst		ok
2009-09-10T08:52:00.000Z	jjrev	thirst	if they are the same size, then it should be recoverable
2009-09-10T08:53:00.000Z	jjrev	thirst	if you follow those instructions, it should get you what you want.
2009-09-10T08:53:00.000Z	thirst		I hope.. :)
2009-09-10T08:54:00.000Z	jjrev	thirst	good luck, i've never done that before...
2009-09-10T08:55:00.000Z	thirst	jjrev	thanks!. will let you know how it went.. :)
