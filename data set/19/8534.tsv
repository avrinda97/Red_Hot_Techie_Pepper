2007-03-17T07:51:00.000Z	v1nce		is Ubuntu compatible with a core2duo dell insprion or xps?
2007-03-17T07:51:00.000Z	sethk	v1nce	generally.  power save is questionable
2007-03-17T07:51:00.000Z	sethk	v1nce	so is hibernate
2007-03-17T07:56:00.000Z	sethk	v1nce	I've had good results with thinkpad, and with fujitsu.  dell, results are mixed
2007-03-17T08:02:00.000Z	sethk	v1nce	32 bits
2007-03-17T08:02:00.000Z	sethk	v1nce	and lots of software that doesn't quite run in 64 bit mode
2007-03-17T08:03:00.000Z	sethk	v1nce	always happy to serve  :)
2007-03-17T08:03:00.000Z	sethk	v1nce	there is sometimes an emulation mode but it will be slow
2007-03-17T08:04:00.000Z	sethk	v1nce	hardly.
2007-03-17T08:04:00.000Z	sethk	v1nce	IMHO 64 bits isn't worthwhile at this point, due to lagging software availability
2007-03-17T08:05:00.000Z	sethk	v1nce	some are supported, yes, but not all of the applications have been built and tested in 64 bit.
2007-03-17T08:05:00.000Z	sethk	v1nce	you can run the 32 bit o/s on 64 bit hardware, without problems
2007-03-17T08:05:00.000Z	sethk	v1nce	the problems occur trying to run 32 bit apps with the 64 bit version of the o/s.
2007-03-17T08:06:00.000Z	sethk	v1nce	you understand what I mean?  you can run 32 bit linux on your 64 bit laptop (or desktop or whatever) with no problem
2007-03-17T08:06:00.000Z	v1nce	sethk	oh so i could run the 32 bit ubuntu on a duo 2 core
2007-03-17T08:06:00.000Z	sethk	v1nce	I'm saying I don't recommend installing the 64 bit distro.
2007-03-17T08:06:00.000Z	sethk	v1nce	yes, absolutely
2007-03-17T08:06:00.000Z	sethk	v1nce	and you will not see problems.
2007-03-17T08:09:00.000Z	sethk	v1nce	what do you mean?
