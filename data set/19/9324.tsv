2008-05-02T03:20:00.000Z	effowe		i've been having random crashes on 8.04 where it goes to a black screen and puts me back at the login screen, is there any error log that I can pull up to see what's going on?
2008-05-02T03:21:00.000Z	shane2peru	effowe	are you able to log in?  What graphics card do you have?
2008-05-02T03:21:00.000Z	effowe	shane2peru	i log in just fine, and it works pretty well for the most part, just random crashes, im on an nvidia 8800gtx
2008-05-02T03:22:00.000Z	shane2peru	effowe	hmm, not sure, I had ATI graphics problems and it wouldn't even let me log in. Possible related to graphics??? not sure.
2008-05-02T03:22:00.000Z	shane2peru	effowe	is there anything in the logs?
2008-05-02T03:23:00.000Z	effowe		hmm. ., ok i did the cat /var/log/X0rg.0.log and its pretty long.. i didnt see anything
2008-05-02T03:23:00.000Z	effowe		can someone chat with me in pm about this?
2008-05-02T03:24:00.000Z	shane2peru	effowe	a little easier way is, System -> Administration -> System Logs
2008-05-02T03:24:00.000Z	shane2peru	effowe	you can search there, and look for the date of your last crash and last time it happened, and look about that time, that will at least help get you pointed in the right direction
2008-05-02T03:26:00.000Z	effowe	shane2peru	check your pm
2008-05-02T03:26:00.000Z	shane2peru	effowe	don't know how. lol
2008-05-02T03:26:00.000Z	effowe		heh
2008-05-02T03:26:00.000Z	effowe		double click me or something
2008-05-02T03:27:00.000Z	shane2peru	effowe	I'm semi Linux knowledgeable, but irc, I'm  a nooooooob.
2008-05-02T03:27:00.000Z	effowe	shane2peru	for sure, i dont know what im looking for in here, my last crash was like 15 minutes ago, so its in here somewhere..
2008-05-02T03:29:00.000Z	shane2peru	effowe	check out your sys, xorg, or kernel,  see if there is anything odd?  Or even keep checking back to see if something always shows up in the logs at the time of crashes.
2008-05-02T03:29:00.000Z	shane2peru	effowe	it will probably say error, or something.
2008-05-02T03:30:00.000Z	effowe		shane: aight, thanks for the help, im looking around
2008-05-02T03:30:00.000Z	shane2peru	effowe	no prob
