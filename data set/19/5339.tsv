2008-07-20T02:38:00.000Z	adamcube		Hey everyone. I'm having some problems with MPlayer on the latest stable Ubuntu release (I think it's 8.04 or something). Whenever I play a video file, I get "Error opening/initializing the selected video_out (-vo) device". Any ideas?
2008-07-20T02:40:00.000Z	adamcube		Where's the .mplayer folder?
2008-07-20T02:40:00.000Z	nickrud	adamcube	~/.mplayer (your home dir)
2008-07-20T02:45:00.000Z	nickrud	adamcube	if you do   cd && ls -ld .mplayer , you should see it.
2008-07-20T02:46:00.000Z	nickrud	adamcube	or, in the file manager, hit  view->hidden files on the menu bar, you'll see it in your home directory (assuming mplayer has been run at least once)
2008-07-20T02:46:00.000Z	adamcube	nickrud	run that through the terminal?
2008-07-20T02:46:00.000Z	nickrud	adamcube	yes, or use the second method I gave
2008-07-20T02:47:00.000Z	adamcube	nickrud	could you tell me the path from FileSystem, so I can follow it in the GUI rather than the terminal?
2008-07-20T02:47:00.000Z	nickrud	adamcube	 /home/<your username>/.mplayer
2008-07-20T02:47:00.000Z	adamcube	nickrud	Haha, it's not there. Now I'm confused..
2008-07-20T02:48:00.000Z	nickrud	adamcube	if you don't turn on viewing hidden files, you won't see it. And, mplayer has to have been run at least once to create the configuration
2008-07-20T02:49:00.000Z	adamcube	nickrud	How do I turn on hidden files. Sorry - I'm used to Windows...
2008-07-20T02:49:00.000Z	nickrud	adamcube	on the file manager menu bar, view->hidden files
2008-07-20T02:50:00.000Z	adamcube	nickrud	I feel stupid now. ^^;; Thanks, though.
2008-07-20T02:50:00.000Z	nickrud	adamcube	don't sweat it, the details you learn will add up fast ;)
2008-07-20T02:51:00.000Z	adamcube	nickrud	Whilst I'm at it, what's the easiest way to edit a protected file (one that wants my password first), without having to go through the terminal?
2008-07-20T02:52:00.000Z	nickrud	adamcube	I _always_ use the terminal to edit protected files, it makes me aware that I'm messing with system stuff. Keeps my stuff and system stuff visually separate
2008-07-20T02:53:00.000Z	nickrud	adamcube	take a look at gscripts.sourceforge.net , I think there's a script there you can add to nautilus that will give you a 'open with gksu' option
2008-07-20T02:53:00.000Z	adamcube	nickrud	Ah, all that just to point vo_driver at "x11".... :p
