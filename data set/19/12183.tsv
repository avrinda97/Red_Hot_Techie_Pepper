2006-03-08T09:25:00.000Z	pulver		hey! what do u have to type to compile gftp with ssl support? did a 'sudo apt-get source gftp'. what should the ./configure line be like?
2006-03-08T09:26:00.000Z	pulver		the default ubuntu gftp dosen't have ssl support =/
2006-03-08T09:26:00.000Z	tritium_	pulver	it already has it.  Don't recompile it!
2006-03-08T09:27:00.000Z	pulver	tritium_	it has? how do u activate it then?
2006-03-08T09:28:00.000Z	tritium_	pulver	you just use it
2006-03-08T09:31:00.000Z	pulver	tritium_	 im trying to login using gftp (gui version) but it says that i have to use encryption then disconnects
2006-03-08T09:32:00.000Z	tritium_	pulver	are you selecting sftp as the protocol before you connect?
2006-03-08T09:33:00.000Z	pulver	tritium_	nope how do u do that :)
2006-03-08T09:33:00.000Z	tritium_	pulver	there's a little drop-down in the upper right corner where you select the protocol
2006-03-08T09:36:00.000Z	pulver	tritium_	oh i need glasses lol.. anyway i don't see sftp in it, well i did removed gftp before when messing around...
2006-03-08T09:36:00.000Z	tritium_	pulver	it might list ssh rather than sftp
2006-03-08T09:40:00.000Z	pulver	tritium_	ok.. ssh2 is there.. is that the one? selecting it says something about initiating protocol when trying to login and then the program hangs
2006-03-08T09:41:00.000Z	tritium_	pulver	yes, ssh2.  What do you know about the other end you're trying to connect to?
2006-03-08T09:44:00.000Z	pulver	tritium_	heh thats me too trying to run vsftpd with ssl and connect to it works fine with secureftp
2006-03-08T09:44:00.000Z	tritium_	pulver	ah, okay.
2006-03-08T09:46:00.000Z	pulver	tritium_	do you know any dependencies for gftp that i might have messed up that is needed for this to work?
2006-03-08T09:47:00.000Z	tritium_	pulver	it if installed, its dependencies were satisfied
2006-03-08T09:48:00.000Z	pulver	tritium_	ok, well thanks for your help, its  a bit clearer to me now
2006-03-08T09:48:00.000Z	tritium_	pulver	not sure why it's not working for you...
