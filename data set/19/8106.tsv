2007-08-24T10:17:00.000Z	longgia2001	bulmer	all workspace act the same ... just a boring blue backgound
2007-08-24T10:17:00.000Z	longgia2001	bulmer	I've check the ~/Desktop/, all the files are still there
2007-08-24T10:18:00.000Z	bulmer	longgia2001	if you type alt+tab any thing shows up?
2007-08-24T10:18:00.000Z	longgia2001	bulmer	the last time before this happened, I put a unreadable VCD into the tray, and the box get unresponse, I loged out with CTRL ALT backspace
2007-08-24T10:19:00.000Z	bulmer	longgia2001	that should just restarted your X window..reboot and everything should be back in order

2007-08-24T10:20:00.000Z	bulmer	longgia2001	so its okay now?
2007-08-24T10:21:00.000Z	longgia2001	bulmer	It's still nothing on the desktop, just the GNOME bar & the application bar
2007-08-24T10:22:00.000Z	bulmer	longgia2001	maybe you re-create the icons again?
2007-08-24T10:23:00.000Z	longgia2001	bulmer	I cant even change the background by right click the desktop, I have to do it through the menu
2007-08-24T10:24:00.000Z	longgia2001	bulmer	the desktop comes not response to right click
2007-08-24T10:24:00.000Z	bulmer	longgia2001	its seems like there is an app that if covering your entire display..i had something like that before..
2007-08-24T10:30:00.000Z	longgia2001	bulmer	I found that: when login with another user, the splash screen ... show 'loading desktop' icon; while, with the current user, there is no 'loading desktop' while loging in ???
2007-08-24T10:32:00.000Z	bulmer	longgia2001	they both have same config files? check those
2007-08-24T10:32:00.000Z	longgia2001	bulmer	nope, each user has a diff config, I think ... but I dun know which is the config file
