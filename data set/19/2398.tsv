2010-09-23T06:03:00.000Z	tripleb		 HELP I rebooted and my text got so big that I cant get to  system in the application places system. It shows but  starts other things. I thought I'd go to display. I
2010-09-23T06:05:00.000Z	rames	tripleb	ALT-F2 then "gnome-display-properties"
2010-09-23T06:07:00.000Z	rames	tripleb	let me know if that worked ... ALT-F2 gnome-display-properties
2010-09-23T06:09:00.000Z	tripleb	rames	it's just a lot of information. No actions.
2010-09-23T06:10:00.000Z	rames	tripleb	it should let you change resolution, etc.
2010-09-23T06:10:00.000Z	tripleb	rames	it's a real bug to be able to lose ability to access the programs on the taskbar.
2010-09-23T06:10:00.000Z	rames	tripleb	xrandr -s 1024x768 ... try that (from command line somewhere?)
2010-09-23T06:12:00.000Z	tripleb	rames	it asked me if I wanted to use the vedors graphics drivers instead because I didnt have the ability to use the tool. THAT gave me the info screens. --- I didnt do xrandr yet BUT I removed everything from the taskbar and now I can get to system. BUT how do I fix this -BIG LETTERS. lol
2010-09-23T06:13:00.000Z	tripleb	rames	hara1@hara1-desktop:~$ xrandr -s 1024x768
2010-09-23T06:13:00.000Z	rames	tripleb	... xrandr for me gives: 1024x600       60.0*+   65.0    ... the starred line is the resolution ... you can then do xrandr -s ZZZZxYYYY to change it
2010-09-23T06:14:00.000Z	rames	tripleb	how did you get into this mess?  :D
2010-09-23T06:16:00.000Z	rames	tripleb	lol ... ok... "xrandr" just by itself should give you a list of acceptable modes
2010-09-23T06:17:00.000Z	rames	tripleb	xrandar -s 1234x567  should try to set the monitor to that resolution ... 1234x567 is no way going to work so you have to pick one of the modes that "xrandr" by itself supports
2010-09-23T06:18:00.000Z	rames	tripleb	but it sounds like you might have misconfigured something with your graphics setup so that it isn't supporting your video card correctly anymore
2010-09-23T06:18:00.000Z	rames	tripleb	if you can get a ~better~ resolution via that "xrandr -s ...." command that'll help you to be able to diagnose the probable real root cause (misconfigured graphics card driver)
2010-09-23T06:19:00.000Z	rames	tripleb	since your letters won't be so big! :P
2010-09-23T06:29:00.000Z	rames	tripleb	i'm afraid to try to help you too much, i might get interrupted and have to leave and graphics stuff can take a while to resolve (log in / out / reboot, etc)
2010-09-23T06:30:00.000Z	rames	tripleb	plus i only know how to configure stuff "the old way" like by hand ... there's probably tons of better ways to do things nowadays
2010-09-23T06:36:00.000Z	rames	tripleb	welcome to linux!!! you're going to learn a lot today (and it'll only hurt a little :P )
