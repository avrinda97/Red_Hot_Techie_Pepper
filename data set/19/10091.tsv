2007-10-30T20:37:00.000Z	malocite		Can someone give me a quick hand adding a new harddrive to fstab so that when I boot the drive will mount on its own?
2007-10-30T20:39:00.000Z	malocite		is there a better program to use for unzipping files than file-roller???
2007-10-30T20:39:00.000Z	Vlet	malocite	better how?
2007-10-30T20:40:00.000Z	malocite		vlet well, file-roller has this really annoying bug.  If you right click on a ZIP file for example, and say EXTRACT HERE it never works - it says  "Ann error occurred while extracting files" then when you click on command line output it says "warning:  stripped absolute path spec from /
2007-10-30T20:40:00.000Z	malocite		mapname:  conversion of  failed
2007-10-30T20:40:00.000Z	malocite		"
2007-10-30T20:41:00.000Z	Vlet	malocite	strange.. extract here works for me :/
2007-10-30T20:41:00.000Z	malocite		its listed as a bug
2007-10-30T20:42:00.000Z	malocite		it did it to me in Feisty (but the FIRST file would always unzip first)
2007-10-30T20:42:00.000Z	malocite		now that I am in gutsy it extracts nothing
2007-10-30T20:42:00.000Z	Vlet	malocite	yep, works fine for me
2007-10-30T20:43:00.000Z	malocite		vlet: well, back to my original question, is there another program I can use
2007-10-30T20:43:00.000Z	malocite	shishir	gnomes compressed file manager
2007-10-30T20:43:00.000Z	Vlet	malocite	xarchiver perhaps
