2006-09-20T08:39:00.000Z	flasher		how can i tell whether my old computer has USB 2.0 or USB 1.0 ports? I ask because I want to know whether USB 1.0 has less power (to charge my iPod).
2006-09-20T08:39:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	flasher	usb 1.0 is lower power
2006-09-20T08:40:00.000Z	flasher	nomasteryoda	what's lsusb?
2006-09-20T08:41:00.000Z	flasher	nomasteryoda	i don't need to know what things are plugged in, just wthere my comp has usb 1 or usb 2
2006-09-20T08:41:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	flasher	and lspci
2006-09-20T08:45:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	flasher	i would get a stand-alone usb charger for the ipod
2006-09-20T08:45:00.000Z	flasher	nomasteryoda	why? Do you mean just in my case, since I have a usb1.1 computer?
2006-09-20T08:46:00.000Z	flasher	nomasteryoda	can you tell me more of what you mean by "lower power"?

2006-09-20T08:48:00.000Z	flasher	nomasteryoda	thanks
2006-09-20T08:49:00.000Z	flasher	nomasteryoda	i don' think it helps
2006-09-20T08:49:00.000Z	flasher	nomasteryoda	it talks about new design
2006-09-20T08:51:00.000Z	flasher	nomasteryoda	are you sure that the USB 1.1 ports supply less power than USB 2.0 ports?
2006-09-20T08:51:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	flasher	i know they do
2006-09-20T08:52:00.000Z	flasher	nomasteryoda	can you give a reference source please? Coz someone else told me they supply same power
2006-09-20T08:55:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	flasher	 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Serial_Bus#Power_supply
2006-09-20T09:12:00.000Z	flasher	nomasteryoda	you said that your 2.0 drives won't work without 2 usb 1.1 ports because each drive needs 2 1.1 cables plugged in? Also, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Serial_Bus#Power_supply doesn't say anything about the difference in power supply between usb 1.1 and 2.0
2006-09-20T09:13:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	flasher	well i know it is different for some devices... maybe they are not using standard usb specs
2006-09-20T09:16:00.000Z	flasher	nomasteryoda	by the way, am i on 1.1 or 1.0. -----> 0000:00:04.2 USB Controller: Intel Corporation 82371AB/EB/MB PIIX4 USB (rev 01)
