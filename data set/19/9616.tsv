2008-07-04T01:29:00.000Z	matthew__		anyone know how I could make the terminal switch colours depending on what user is using it? I want it to look extremely eye burningly annoying when you su to root, so people think about what they are doing first
2008-07-04T01:29:00.000Z	Fryguy--	matthew__	set PS1 in .bashrc
2008-07-04T01:29:00.000Z	matthew__	Fryguy--	where is bashrc ?
2008-07-04T01:30:00.000Z	Fryguy--	matthew__	.bashrc, it's a file in your home directory that gets started whenever bash is run
2008-07-04T01:40:00.000Z	matthew__	Fryguy--	 could you tell me exactly (or close) how to make my terminal change colours when root is using it (or a user su's to root) because .bashrc has me totally lost
2008-07-04T01:41:00.000Z	Fryguy--	matthew__	set a PS1 for your .bashrc, and then set a PS1 for the .bashrc of the root user.  Just google "setting bash prompt" there's plenty of tips available
2008-07-04T02:34:00.000Z	Fryguy--	matthew__	right click add to panel
2008-07-07T23:57:00.000Z	Fryguy--	matthew__	need another tool for that, that's not what crontab does
2008-07-08T01:48:00.000Z	Fryguy--	matthew__	permissions on the directory
2008-07-08T01:51:00.000Z	matthew__	Fryguy--	how can I have sudo run a command that has spaces in it? It just gives me "command not found"
2008-07-08T01:51:00.000Z	Fryguy--	matthew__	what command
2008-07-08T01:51:00.000Z	matthew__	Fryguy--	oops, I had quotes around it by mistake, removing them seemed to fix it
2008-07-08T01:51:00.000Z	Fryguy--	matthew__	short answer, use quotes or escape the spaces with \
2008-07-08T02:40:00.000Z	Fryguy--	matthew__	gvfsd running
2008-07-08T02:41:00.000Z	matthew__	Fryguy--	Shouldn't using sudo get around that if it is running?
2008-07-08T02:41:00.000Z	Fryguy--	matthew__	no
2008-07-08T02:42:00.000Z	matthew__	Fryguy--	but isn't root the magical override to everything?
2008-07-08T02:42:00.000Z	Fryguy--	matthew__	no
2008-07-08T02:42:00.000Z	matthew__	Fryguy--	That might be it then, i'll see if gvfs is running
