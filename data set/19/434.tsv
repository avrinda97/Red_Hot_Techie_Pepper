2012-03-30T08:17:00.000Z	Wingede	pmp6nl	 if you can ping each box from one another ok I would check if there is no firewall stopping things - at least that will eliminate networking
2012-03-30T08:18:00.000Z	pmp6nl	Wingede	thanks for the tip, i can ping each box
2012-03-30T08:19:00.000Z	Wingede	pmp6nl	any firewalls enabled on the boxes?
2012-03-30T08:19:00.000Z	pmp6nl	Wingede	IDK, whats the best way to check?
2012-03-30T08:20:00.000Z	Wingede	pmp6nl	at consoles sudo iptables -L
2012-03-30T08:22:00.000Z	Wingede	pmp6nl	3 chains - if they are all are accept it pretty much rules firewalls out also
2012-03-30T08:22:00.000Z	pmp6nl	Wingede	that is what they say
2012-03-30T08:23:00.000Z	pmp6nl	Wingede	its odd that putty works but I cannot ssh in via terminal or use rsync
2012-03-30T08:24:00.000Z	Wingede	pmp6nl	im not familiar with unison, but assuming from your comments the sync is done over ssh ?
2012-03-30T08:25:00.000Z	pmp6nl	Wingede	yes, I am trying anyway.  I dont care how they sync, I just want them to sync over the network
2012-03-30T08:25:00.000Z	Wingede	pmp6nl	perhaps http://www.howtoforge.com/setting-up-unison-file-synchronization-between-two-servers-on-ubuntu-11.10 can help
2012-03-30T08:26:00.000Z	pmp6nl	Wingede	humm I tried some of that but no dice.  I think the underlying problem is not being able to ssh in via terminal... isnt that odd?
2012-03-30T08:28:00.000Z	Wingede	pmp6nl	is ssh installed?
2012-03-30T08:28:00.000Z	pmp6nl	Wingede	yes it is, on both
2012-03-30T08:29:00.000Z	Wingede	pmp6nl	are you trying to ssh using root as username?
2012-03-30T08:29:00.000Z	pmp6nl	Wingede	 no, the reg user name.
2012-03-30T08:30:00.000Z	pmp6nl	Wingede	thanks for your help, I will look throught that link.  I gotta go now.  I appreciate your help
2012-03-30T08:30:00.000Z	Wingede	pmp6nl	good luck
2012-03-30T08:30:00.000Z	pmp6nl	Wingede	thanks
