2008-12-21T02:31:00.000Z	Jordan_U	beargins	It's no longer needed, almost everything is detected automagically by X

2008-12-21T02:39:00.000Z	beargins	Jordan_U	, are there any entries in your xorg.conf?
2008-12-21T02:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U	beargins	No

2008-12-21T02:41:00.000Z	Jordan_U	beargins	You can probably find some old scripts that will setup an xorg.conf, but why? In one case you are using a script to automatically create a configuration for X, in the other you are letting X automatically configure itself
