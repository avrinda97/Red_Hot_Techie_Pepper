2008-02-24T19:14:00.000Z	Nuba1		so virtualbox is relatively easy to install?
2008-02-24T19:14:00.000Z	Nuba1		i'm not asking how to install
2008-02-24T19:14:00.000Z	Nuba1		I'm asking how it compares to vmware
2008-02-24T19:15:00.000Z	Nuba1		yeah, and managing the images, etc?
2008-02-24T19:16:00.000Z	Nuba1		also, can I use vmware images in virtualbox?
2008-02-24T19:16:00.000Z	Nuba1		or do I need to recreate images?
2008-02-24T19:17:00.000Z	Nuba1		wow, cadefy, you are intellegent
2008-02-24T19:18:00.000Z	Nuba1		so... can I use vmware images in virtualbox?
2008-02-24T19:18:00.000Z	Nuba1		or must I create new ones?
2008-02-24T19:19:00.000Z	Nuba1		so I'm stuck with vmware then
2008-02-24T19:19:00.000Z	tsmithe	Nuba1	you can use vmware's vmdk images in virtualbox
2008-02-24T19:20:00.000Z	Nuba1	tsmithe	u're sure?
2008-02-24T19:20:00.000Z	tsmithe	Nuba1	yes. or at least, it lets me.
2008-02-24T19:20:00.000Z	Nuba1		just asking cause the other user said no
2008-02-24T19:20:00.000Z	Nuba1		I'll try it, doesn't hurt to apt-get it
2008-02-24T19:21:00.000Z	tsmithe	Nuba1	i don't know what version of vbox the other user is using. i'm using virtualbox-ose from the ubuntu development version.
2008-02-24T19:21:00.000Z	Nuba1		yeah well, I'm on hardy alpha 5
2008-02-24T19:21:00.000Z	Nuba1		so should be same
