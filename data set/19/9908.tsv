2006-08-29T11:42:00.000Z	archaios		I used to have one
2006-08-29T11:42:00.000Z	archaios		it's very unfriendly on Linux
2006-08-29T11:42:00.000Z	archaios		runs horrifically slowly
2006-08-29T11:43:00.000Z	archaios		I had one up until a year ago :P
2006-08-29T11:45:00.000Z	archaios		but it's not "very important for business ppl"
2006-08-29T11:45:00.000Z	archaios		most people I know only use outlook as a basic mail client, jake1
2006-08-29T11:46:00.000Z	archaios		all my business clients included
2006-08-29T11:47:00.000Z	archaios		as bluefox83 rightly points out
2006-08-29T11:47:00.000Z	archaios		schedule syncing and such are proprietary Microsoft features
2006-08-29T11:47:00.000Z	archaios		and I don't think there's any open source client for that
2006-08-29T11:48:00.000Z	bluefox83	archaios	there's no reason to think you couldn't do that with a simple plugin in evolution...
2006-08-29T11:49:00.000Z	archaios	bluefox83	even
2006-08-29T11:49:00.000Z	archaios	bluefox83	whilst it could be done, I don't think it actually has been done
2006-08-29T11:49:00.000Z	archaios	bluefox83	few people actually use it
2006-08-29T11:49:00.000Z	bluefox83	archaios	i don't think any business would be foolish enough to actually rely on anything like that..least i hope not..
2006-08-29T11:49:00.000Z	archaios	bluefox83	I agree
2006-08-29T11:50:00.000Z	archaios	bluefox83	none of my clients (even all those in the IT industry) use that feature
2006-08-29T11:50:00.000Z	archaios	bluefox83	it's actually a relic that dates back to Windows for Workgroups 3.11 -- Schedule+
2006-08-29T11:50:00.000Z	archaios	bluefox83	they simply rebranded it and integrated it into Outlook
