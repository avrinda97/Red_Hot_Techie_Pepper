2008-07-23T06:57:00.000Z	ubuntu_		when i try to install kubuntu it doesn shows me the partitions i have made but only shows one partition .. that is the hardisk. now i used qtparted and it gave the following msg. whats wrong any help? ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo qtparted    Error: Can't have overlapping partitions.
2008-07-23T06:59:00.000Z	vilemaxim	ubuntu_	I'd try deleting the partion and recreating them.  Sometimes rebooting after messing with the partitions helps
2008-07-23T06:59:00.000Z	ubuntu_	vilemaxim	 i have data in them
2008-07-23T07:00:00.000Z	ubuntu_	vilemaxim	 i have data in them. i will get deleted if i recreated them
2008-07-23T07:01:00.000Z	vilemaxim	ubuntu_	 you were installing ubuntu on a partition you have data on?
2008-07-23T07:02:00.000Z	ubuntu_	vilemaxim	 i have other partitions on a hd. and i want to install ubuntu on one of them. but the installed or g/qtparted isnot showing any partitions. just the hd.
2008-07-23T07:03:00.000Z	vilemaxim	ubuntu_	hmmmm.... sounds like the partition table got messed up.  I would test the harddrive first
2008-07-23T07:03:00.000Z	ubuntu_	vilemaxim	 how
2008-07-23T07:04:00.000Z	ubuntu_	vilemaxim	 fdisk -l is show partions good.
2008-07-23T07:04:00.000Z	ubuntu_	vilemaxim	 how would you check the hd
2008-07-23T07:04:00.000Z	vilemaxim	ubuntu_	I use UBCD http://www.ultimatebootcd.com/ ... Seagate puts out a harddrive diagnostic tool
2008-07-23T07:04:00.000Z	ubuntu_	vilemaxim	 and ya. when runing windows. it got held 2 times.
2008-07-23T07:04:00.000Z	ubuntu_	vilemaxim	 held = no keyboard mouxe usage.
2008-07-23T07:06:00.000Z	vilemaxim	ubuntu_	hmmm... I might not be able to help you.  I don't believe I ever ran into that situation.... And I work as a repair shop that uses linux a lot.
2008-07-23T07:06:00.000Z	vilemaxim	ubuntu_	I would still test the drive
2008-07-23T07:07:00.000Z	ubuntu_	vilemaxim	 which tool do you sue again?
2008-07-23T07:07:00.000Z	vilemaxim	ubuntu_	 http://www.ultimatebootcd.com/
