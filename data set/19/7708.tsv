2007-07-08T12:58:00.000Z	whytey		hey all
2007-07-08T12:58:00.000Z	Typwn	whytey	Hello
2007-07-08T12:59:00.000Z	whytey		Ta Typwyn.  I am having an issue with my ubuntu box.  It aint ubuntu specific but I have no idea where to look
2007-07-08T13:00:00.000Z	Typwn	whytey	What's the problem?
2007-07-08T13:00:00.000Z	whytey		Basically, it won't boot at all.  It has been up for ever (at least 36 days last time I looked).  Lastnight it stopped working and all I can see is that it gets to the boot phase where it says 'Brought up 2 CPUs" and then stops
2007-07-08T13:01:00.000Z	Typwn	whytey	Are the contents of the box itself okay?
2007-07-08T13:01:00.000Z	whytey		I did a memtest and get occasional errors but despite mixing the memory in and out, there is no improvements
2007-07-08T13:01:00.000Z	whytey	Typwn	Yeah, it all looks good.  I just stripped out my tuner cards etc so it is down to the mobo, cpu and a stick of ram
2007-07-08T13:02:00.000Z	whytey		I stuck in a feisty live cd and it gives me the boot options but still doesn't boot
2007-07-08T13:02:00.000Z	whytey		...once I select the first option
2007-07-08T13:02:00.000Z	Typwn	whytey	Deffinately seems like a hardware failure
2007-07-08T13:03:00.000Z	whytey	Typwn	do you think CPU or mobo or anything else in particular?
2007-07-08T13:04:00.000Z	Typwn	whytey	Could be anything really. Everything in a box needs to be working or there will be failure. Check everything from PSU to CPU, to Mobo
2007-07-08T13:04:00.000Z	whytey	Typwn	Cheers mate.  I gotta feeling this is going to be expensive
2007-07-08T13:05:00.000Z	Typwn	whytey	Not really. Could be one thing, could be many.
2007-07-08T13:05:00.000Z	whytey		not to worry, I know it isnt 'buntu's fault. ;)
2007-07-08T13:06:00.000Z	whytey	Typwn	I don't have a spare CPU or Mobo or to test with.  Thats the problem.  I will have to buy replacements
2007-07-08T13:06:00.000Z	whytey		Anyways, definately sounds like hardware, which is the confirmation I was after
2007-07-08T13:06:00.000Z	Typwn	whytey	What about Drives?
