2011-06-16T04:37:00.000Z	stercor		When I insert my 16Gb flash drive, it doesn't automount.  How do I mount it, or find out the /dev entry?
2011-06-16T04:38:00.000Z	dr_willis	stercor	 'dmesg' command or 'blkid' or   'sudo fdisk -l'
2011-06-16T04:38:00.000Z	dr_willis	stercor	 then use the proper mount command.
2011-06-29T21:01:00.000Z	stercor	dr_willis	OK to repost a question that I asked just before you logged in?
2011-06-29T21:01:00.000Z	dr_willis	stercor	 go for it. :)
2011-06-29T21:02:00.000Z	stercor	dr_willis	I upgraded from 10.04 to 10.10.  There is a box, "Error authenticating some packages" with 1630 entries.  Is this troublesome and how can I fix it?
2011-06-29T21:03:00.000Z	dr_willis	stercor	 i would have to think some gpg keys or other  keyfiles are missing.  soundsa like every package is  having the same issue.
2011-06-29T21:03:00.000Z	dr_willis	stercor	 i always do clean installs.. i rarely upgrade
2011-06-29T21:05:00.000Z	stercor	dr_willis	That would  be my preference too.  But how can I keep from reformatting the hard drive?
2011-06-29T21:05:00.000Z	dr_willis	stercor	 i keep /home/ on its own partition. i dont loose user data that way. Makes reinstalling easier.
2011-07-01T23:35:00.000Z	dr_willis	stercor	 ask that on askubuntu.com
2011-07-01T23:35:00.000Z	stercor	dr_willis	Ok.
2012-01-14T02:27:00.000Z	dr_willis	stercor	 YOu do have backups of imporntant stuff?
2012-01-14T02:28:00.000Z	stercor	dr_willis	I have backups of what I'm currently working on.  But there's a possibility that I'll have a head-slapper.
2012-05-01T06:40:00.000Z	dr_willis	stercor	  what toolbar?
2012-05-01T06:41:00.000Z	dr_willis	stercor	 thats the 'launcher'
2012-05-01T06:42:00.000Z	dr_willis	stercor	 try making a new user see if the desktop works normally for them.
2012-05-01T06:42:00.000Z	stercor	dr_willis	thanks will do,
2012-05-01T06:42:00.000Z	dr_willis	stercor	 if it does then you may wangt to reset unity for the problem user
