2012-04-12T12:34:00.000Z	JohnnyricoMC		My problem is: whenever my preseed-install reaches the tasksel-step, it fails: tasksel tasksel/first multiselect standard, ubuntu-desktop
2012-04-12T12:34:00.000Z	JohnnyricoMC		And I get a screen saying the failing step is "Select and install software"
2012-04-12T12:35:00.000Z	JohnnyricoMC		anyone have any ideas? What my own googling returned as suspect is partitioning, but I need the preseed file to automatically partition the disk (just use whole disk, wipe anything else on there)
2012-04-12T12:36:00.000Z	sacarlson	JohnnyricoMC	you want to setup auto install?
2012-04-12T12:46:00.000Z	sacarlson	JohnnyricoMC	seems I saw some other people  having problems with preeseed,  I thought I saw another method other than preseed that debian used
2012-04-12T12:47:00.000Z	JohnnyricoMC	sacarlson	ubuntu is indeed supposed to support kickstart, but I tried that and couldn't get ubuntu to obey the kickstart-file
2012-04-12T12:48:00.000Z	sacarlson	JohnnyricoMC	oh ya it was kickstart that's mest up not preseed
2012-04-12T12:49:00.000Z	sacarlson	JohnnyricoMC	and I saw a method to create the preseed file with the alternate ubuntu iso installer
2012-04-12T12:54:00.000Z	sacarlson	JohnnyricoMC	that's the same ubuntu sever iso I think that the same as the alternate
2012-04-12T13:24:00.000Z	sacarlson	JohnnyricoMC	 where are you putting you preseed.cfg file and how are you passing the file to the installer?
2012-04-12T13:26:00.000Z	sacarlson	JohnnyricoMC	cobbler?  never heard of it
2012-04-12T13:27:00.000Z	sacarlson	JohnnyricoMC	oh pxe
2012-04-12T13:27:00.000Z	sacarlson	JohnnyricoMC	 I just run pxe from one of my servers
2012-04-12T13:28:00.000Z	sacarlson	JohnnyricoMC	ok and how do you tell it where that files is at boot?
2012-04-12T13:39:00.000Z	sacarlson	JohnnyricoMC	ok thanks I'm reading the cobbler docs to see if I should install it or just make the needed changes in my pxe server to try it
2012-04-12T13:41:00.000Z	sacarlson	JohnnyricoMC	in my pxe boot it just comes up like a live cd and it's all manual to install, so I'm going to try this preseed method to install to a virtualbox presents
2012-04-12T13:42:00.000Z	sacarlson	JohnnyricoMC	I've already use dhcp3 and will make the needed changes there
2012-04-12T13:44:00.000Z	sacarlson	JohnnyricoMC	yes there is another added option at boot install for text but I thought that was the default in the alternate installer
2012-04-12T13:46:00.000Z	sacarlson	JohnnyricoMC	I don't think I provided any help yet, but your welcome any way
