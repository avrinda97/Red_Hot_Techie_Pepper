2009-05-24T10:23:00.000Z	beatlesfan		dslam, thanks
2009-05-24T10:24:00.000Z	beatlesfan		I just wish there was a decent personal finance app for Gnome.. don't like that Gnucash
2009-05-24T10:25:00.000Z	beatlesfan		do you need a firewall when running Ubuntu?
2009-05-24T10:26:00.000Z	beatlesfan		ahh
2009-05-24T10:27:00.000Z	beatlesfan		 <<<< downloading Ubuntu 9.04 now
2009-05-24T10:27:00.000Z	beatlesfan		I like that ubuntu gives you much more flexibility in your hard drive setup
2009-05-24T10:29:00.000Z	beatlesfan		dslam, no mysql but lots of Oracle experience
2009-05-24T10:30:00.000Z	beatlesfan		anyone know how big the base Ubuntu 9.04 install is?
2009-05-24T10:31:00.000Z	beatlesfan		I have a 20GB partition set up
2009-05-24T10:31:00.000Z	beatlesfan		should that be enough?
2009-05-24T10:31:00.000Z	tzanger	beatlesfan	that should be plenty of space
2009-05-24T10:33:00.000Z	tzanger	beatlesfan	I don't think SQL has short-circuits like that
2009-05-24T10:33:00.000Z	beatlesfan	tzanger	of course it does
2009-05-24T10:33:00.000Z	tzanger	beatlesfan	i.e. the FROM a,b,c,d does not necessarily query from a first, then b, c, d
2009-05-24T10:34:00.000Z	tzanger	beatlesfan	yeah, short circuit's the wrong term, I was thinking WHERE but typing FROM :-)
2009-05-24T10:39:00.000Z	beatlesfan	tzanger	depends on how much data and what system too
2009-05-24T10:39:00.000Z	tzanger	beatlesfan	well for sure
2009-05-24T10:46:00.000Z	tzanger	beatlesfan	I bet there are some BIG datasets there!
2009-05-24T10:46:00.000Z	beatlesfan	tzanger	uhh, yeah, there are
