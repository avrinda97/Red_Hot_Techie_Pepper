2011-06-21T03:50:00.000Z	Alexander		what happened SummerB?
2011-06-21T03:50:00.000Z	io	Alexander	sudo
2011-06-21T03:50:00.000Z	io	Alexander	'$ sudo apt-get install proxychains'
2011-06-21T03:52:00.000Z	io	Alexander	you should also read about installing software. plenty of good information above
2011-06-21T03:53:00.000Z	Alexander	io	i think it installed
2011-06-21T03:53:00.000Z	io	Alexander	read the manual. '$ man proxychains'
2011-06-21T03:54:00.000Z	io	Alexander	I said. '$ man proxychains'
2011-06-21T03:55:00.000Z	io	Alexander	don't type the $, that is to indicate a command done through Terminal (in short)
2011-06-21T03:56:00.000Z	io	Alexander	what did you type exactly?
2011-06-21T04:01:00.000Z	io	Alexander	you should be reading a getting started manual first, so that you understand Terminal and Linux in general before going any further
