2012-10-27T11:11:00.000Z	kunji		umm... T.T  one of my laptops just started failing to boot.  The boot hangs at PulseAudio configured for per-user sessions   saned disabled; edit /etc/default/saned     [OK]
2012-10-27T11:12:00.000Z	kunji		I had killed a process on the previous boot that I thought was the xsession...  I feel like I just did something stupid...
2012-10-27T11:13:00.000Z	kunji		Oh, actually I can get to the ttys and login, not sure why I don't get to lightdm on tty7 though
2012-10-27T11:13:00.000Z	pepee	kunji	what kernel?
2012-10-27T11:13:00.000Z	kunji	pepee	umm, 3.0.0-26-generic i686
2012-10-27T11:14:00.000Z	pepee	kunji	check /var/log/Xorg.0.log
2012-10-27T11:16:00.000Z	kunji	pepee	I'm not sure what I should be looking for in there, and I'm not sure how to pastebin it from the terminal.  The gist of the last two lines is:  (II) Unloading evdev    and    ddxSigGiveUp: Closing Log
2012-10-27T11:17:00.000Z	pepee	kunji	so I suppose, from that lines, is that X is not starting
2012-10-27T11:19:00.000Z	kunji	pepee	hmm, it fails, doesn't give anything on the command line, but doing ps ax | grep light doesn't return anything, and while it switched over to tty7, nothing changed on that tty
2012-10-27T11:21:00.000Z	pepee	kunji	nothing at all? were you installing a new graphics driver?
2012-10-27T11:26:00.000Z	kunji	pepee	nothing at all.  Nope, didn't install anything recently.  I've found an error in the logs though Error compiling keymap   Failed to load keymap.  Loading default keymap instead.   generating xkmfile /tmp/...   Error compiling keymap    couldn't compile keymap  Failed to compile keymap   Keyboard initialization filed.  This could be a missing or incorrect setup of xkeyboard-config.   Fatal server error:   Failed to activate core devic
2012-10-27T11:29:00.000Z	pepee	kunji	install this:  x11-xkb-utils
2012-10-27T11:29:00.000Z	pepee	kunji	if it's installed, run sudo apt-get install --reinstall x11-xkb-utils
2012-10-27T11:31:00.000Z	kunji	pepee	there are also errors in .xsessionerrors regarding the same.  I'll try that now, just need a bit to get an internet connection
2012-10-27T11:36:00.000Z	kunji	pepee	You're a total boss man!  Do you think killing that process was the cause though?  The process I killed was /usr/bin/dbus-launch --exit-with-session /usr/bin/gnome-session --session=ubuntu-2d
2012-10-27T11:37:00.000Z	pepee	kunji	could be, yeah. no idea though, I just googled one of the error messages
2012-10-27T11:39:00.000Z	kunji	pepee	ah, thanks, I should have done that, lol, sorry about that, I really appreciate the help ^_^
2012-10-27T11:39:00.000Z	pepee	kunji	btw I googled this:  "Error compiling keymap"
2012-10-27T11:41:00.000Z	kunji	pepee	hmm, yeah, interesting, I'll have to look into what happened to those files.
