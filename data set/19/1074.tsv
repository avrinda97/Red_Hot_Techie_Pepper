2011-05-26T06:09:00.000Z	escott	iFrenzy	you could check that you dont have anything unusual in /etc/X11
2011-05-26T06:10:00.000Z	iFrenzy	escott	what should i be looking for?
2011-05-26T06:10:00.000Z	escott	iFrenzy	what kind of video card do you have?
2011-05-26T06:11:00.000Z	iFrenzy	escott	its an internal intel
2011-05-26T06:11:00.000Z	iFrenzy	escott	I've already ran sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg-video-intel
2011-05-26T06:13:00.000Z	escott	iFrenzy	make sure you don't have an Xorg.conf in /etc/x11 thats the only real suggestion i can give
2011-05-26T06:13:00.000Z	iFrenzy	escott	I have an xorg.conf.failsafe in /etc/X11
2011-05-26T06:14:00.000Z	escott	iFrenzy	thats unusual, but since its failsafe i wouldn't worry
2011-05-26T06:33:00.000Z	escott	iFrenzy	you might test to see if this happens for any other user. you could create a throwaway account and try the same there. if nothing bad happens then it might be in your .* files otherwise it must be /etc
2011-05-26T06:34:00.000Z	iFrenzy	escott	worth a shot
2011-05-26T06:42:00.000Z	iFrenzy	escott	it works fine under other user
2011-05-26T06:43:00.000Z	escott	iFrenzy	since i cant find it anywhere im going to guess it is in gconf you might look in there
2011-05-26T06:44:00.000Z	iFrenzy	escott	what would i be looking for in .gonf
2011-05-26T06:45:00.000Z	escott	iFrenzy	use gconf-editor. otherwise just be looking for anything that might be related to xrandr
2011-05-26T07:06:00.000Z	escott	iFrenzy	no need to replace it
2011-05-26T07:07:00.000Z	iFrenzy	escott	so just delete it and restart?
2011-05-26T07:07:00.000Z	escott	iFrenzy	sure... you will lose any customization you made to your gnome apps but you can just removeit
2011-05-26T07:08:00.000Z	iFrenzy	escott	like my favorites programs and stuff?
2011-05-26T07:08:00.000Z	escott	iFrenzy	just whatever customizations are a in it. like background selection, theme selection, font selection etc
