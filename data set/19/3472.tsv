2009-08-02T20:43:00.000Z	bobbydddd		Hi, I have an external network storage device which I can moutn via samba. Now I can mount it manually. Whats the best way to make this automatic?
2009-08-02T20:44:00.000Z	mrwes	bobbydddd	add a line in your /etc/fstab to mount it at boot time
2009-08-02T20:44:00.000Z	mrwes	bobbydddd	something like this: //192.168.1.101/MyFiles /home/bill/SharedFiles cifs credentials=/home/bill/.creds,_netdev,uid=bill,gid=users 0 0
2009-08-02T20:46:00.000Z	bobbydddd	mrwes	whats the .creds?
2009-08-02T20:47:00.000Z	mrwes	bobbydddd	a read-only file with my username and password for authorization
2009-08-02T20:47:00.000Z	bobbydddd	mrwes	can I leave that out if that share doesn't require one?
2009-08-02T20:47:00.000Z	mrwes	bobbydddd	username= and password=
2009-08-02T20:47:00.000Z	mrwes	bobbydddd	sure
2009-08-02T20:48:00.000Z	mrwes	bobbydddd	also, notice I mounted using cifs -- seems a bit faster
2009-08-02T20:48:00.000Z	mrwes	bobbydddd	and from what I've read that will be the standard file system for samba
2009-08-02T20:48:00.000Z	bobbydddd	mrwes	I'll give that a go now :)
2009-08-02T20:49:00.000Z	mrwes	bobbydddd	don't forget to mkdir for the mount point first, make sure you own and have read/write perms
2009-08-02T20:50:00.000Z	bobbydddd		//192.168.1.101/data /mnt/data cifs _netdev,uid=bob,gid=users 0 0
2009-08-02T20:50:00.000Z	bobbydddd		ok mrwes?
2009-08-02T20:51:00.000Z	mrwes	bobbydddd	looks good, the _netdev will give an error in your logs, but it help make sure the network is available before mounting the share
2009-08-02T20:51:00.000Z	mrwes	bobbydddd	/mnt/data exsists?
2009-08-02T20:52:00.000Z	bobbydddd	mrwes	yes
2009-08-02T20:52:00.000Z	mrwes	bobbydddd	you own it and have rw rights? :)
2009-08-02T20:53:00.000Z	mrwes	bobbydddd	so edit the fstab and then sudo mount -a
