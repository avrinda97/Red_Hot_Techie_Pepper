2007-07-23T05:23:00.000Z	tapas		in ubuntu , what's the place to set environment variables for a specific user?
2007-07-23T05:23:00.000Z	tapas		so that they are set even for programs started by e.g. gnome or kde
2007-07-23T05:24:00.000Z	tetonca	tapas	~/.bash_profile or ~/.bashrc
2007-07-23T05:24:00.000Z	tetonca	tapas	maybe ~/.profile
2007-07-23T05:24:00.000Z	tapas	tetonca	tried that. didn't help
2007-07-23T05:26:00.000Z	tetonca	tapas	why not script it?  the /menu/ is probably what you wish to change the behavior of.  Give an example of what variable you want to change.
2007-07-23T05:26:00.000Z	tapas	tetonca	PATH :)
2007-07-23T05:27:00.000Z	tapas	tetonca	so the alt-f2 kde run dialg finds muy softweare installed in nonstandard places
2007-07-23T05:27:00.000Z	tetonca	tapas	PATH=/foo/bar:$PATH <command>
2007-07-23T05:28:00.000Z	tapas	tetonca	computers are there for automating stuff, not doing stuff manually ;)
2007-07-23T05:28:00.000Z	tetonca	tapas	'egrep PATH .[a-z] *' after a 'cd ~'
2007-07-23T05:29:00.000Z	tetonca	tapas	if you own the machine you can change the setup scripts globally in /etc/*
2007-07-23T05:31:00.000Z	tapas	tetonca	well thanks. i was sure there must be a standard way for this.. seems noone knows it :(
2007-07-23T05:33:00.000Z	tapas	tetonca	hmm, it seems i should just have read about bash_profile more closely. thanks for the tip
2007-07-23T05:34:00.000Z	tetonca	tapas	I wasn't sure if .bash_profile is called or not, in KDE.  Welcome.
2007-07-23T05:34:00.000Z	tapas	tetonca	will try now. it should at aleast according to documentation
2007-07-23T05:34:00.000Z	tetonca	tapas	it really ought to.  or .bashrc ought to.
2007-07-23T05:35:00.000Z	tapas	tetonca	confirmed.. works just fine :)
2007-07-23T05:35:00.000Z	tetonca	tapas	haha.
