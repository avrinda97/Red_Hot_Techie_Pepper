2010-03-31T05:20:00.000Z	torchie		so check it.
2010-03-31T05:21:00.000Z	torchie		does ubuntu netbook remix run well on non-atom x86 procs
2010-03-31T05:21:00.000Z	torchie		because I was thinking, what if I installed that into a wicked powerful computer
2010-03-31T05:22:00.000Z	torchie		would it be better to install netbook remix or xubuntu
2010-03-31T05:22:00.000Z	torchie		no lies, I do like it
2010-03-31T05:23:00.000Z	torchie		can you change the font?
2010-03-31T05:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	torchie	install it then dude
2011-04-20T00:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	torchie	if the files are all owned by you then running it then assigning ownership should work, if not then yo may be able to use: gksudo nautilus    but I'm unsure if the ownership can be given to others. You could just use chown, much easier
2011-04-20T01:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	torchie	then run:  sudo chown -R $USER:USER folder    and it will assign to the user running the command (assuming it can use sudo)
2011-04-20T01:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	torchie	it's far easier to use and advise in cli ;)
2011-04-20T01:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	torchie	the cli is where a LOT of linux's power lies, it can automate and do things the gui stuff can only dream about
2011-04-20T01:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	torchie	you can use gksudo for both if you want, sudo doesn't setup the environment correctly and will cause issues
2011-04-20T01:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	torchie	if you want it mainly owned by root, sure (bit silly for user data)
2011-04-20T01:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	torchie	sudo chown -R $ USER: $ USER /path/to/dir             without the spaces between the $ and U and the : and U
2011-04-20T01:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	torchie	e.g.    sudo chown -R andy:andy /path/to/folder
2011-04-20T01:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	torchie	yes, its a variable for the user running the command, linux is a true multiuser OS so you can switch as you like, using $USER means you don't have to remember who you are
2011-05-06T09:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	torchie	mencoder or mplayer can show it
2011-05-06T09:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	torchie	try:   mencoder -msglevel identify=6 file
2011-05-06T09:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	torchie	or for quick and dirty: mencoder -identify file
