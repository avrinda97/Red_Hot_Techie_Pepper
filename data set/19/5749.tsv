2010-10-10T08:30:00.000Z	emma		is there anyway to close all running applications and windows and restore to a state that is the same as having just started up, without restarting?
2010-10-10T08:31:00.000Z	emma		i just want to go back to the way it was when i started without turning off the computer
2010-10-10T08:31:00.000Z	emma		or reseting the computer.
2010-10-10T08:32:00.000Z	emma		what do you think of ariacus' idea?
2010-10-10T08:32:00.000Z	lucent	emma	the alternative is to ALT-TAB and ALT-F4
2010-10-10T08:33:00.000Z	emma	lucent	why what does that do?
2010-10-10T08:33:00.000Z	lucent	emma	one by one, if you use the keyboard short cuts it goes quick enough for compulsive window-leaver-openers :)
2010-10-10T08:33:00.000Z	emma	lucent	use compiz to quickly go through the list of stuff?
2010-10-10T08:35:00.000Z	lucent	emma	'killall' say the word kill is more like 'tell it' and TERM means terminate, or please close
2010-10-10T08:35:00.000Z	lucent	emma	it's as safe as you want it to be, that's what I think
2010-10-10T08:36:00.000Z	lucent	emma	do you want commands to type in, or click-and-point?
2010-10-10T08:38:00.000Z	lucent	emma	hey if that works for you, good then :)
2010-11-15T13:06:00.000Z	lucent	emma	eh, some of it will work
2010-11-15T13:07:00.000Z	lucent	emma	why do you need it to work with Ubuntu linux?
2010-11-15T13:07:00.000Z	emma	lucent	what do you mean some of it will work?
2010-11-15T13:07:00.000Z	lucent	emma	vauge question, vague answer. :/
2010-11-15T13:12:00.000Z	lucent	emma	are you going to purchase in-person?   It's reasonable to request that the sales person allow you to run a livecd in the system, tell them it is your music or something
2010-11-15T13:13:00.000Z	emma	lucent	yeah i was goinag to buy it in person probably. I'll take a live CD
2010-11-15T13:16:00.000Z	lucent	emma	there are laptops which have been certified for Ubuntu, are you aware?
