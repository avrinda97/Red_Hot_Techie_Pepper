2006-05-27T05:35:00.000Z	DewDude		any idea why hibernate stopped working in Dapper, it just restarts the system now.
2006-05-27T05:36:00.000Z	DewDude		i'm not talking network connections
2006-05-27T05:36:00.000Z	DewDude		i know they get lost
2006-05-27T05:36:00.000Z	DewDude		i'm taking about rather than restoring after syuspend, it just restarts
2006-05-27T05:37:00.000Z	DewDude		cuz i pretty much stopped all my apps that use networking before i hit hibernate
2006-05-27T05:38:00.000Z	DewDude		...oh..wait...would suspend to disk be dependant on the kernal image you were using?
2006-05-27T05:38:00.000Z	amphi	DewDude	this is using swsusp?
2006-05-27T05:39:00.000Z	amphi	DewDude	it might be that you need to boot with restore=/dev/foo where /dev/foo is your swap partition, for it to work
2006-05-27T05:40:00.000Z	amphi	DewDude	er, s/restore/resume
2006-05-27T05:40:00.000Z	amphi	DewDude	and yes, a normal boot will obliterate the session
2006-05-27T05:41:00.000Z	DewDude	amphi	alrighty then, no real big loss
2006-05-27T05:42:00.000Z	amphi	DewDude	yeah, I use swsusp a lot
2006-05-27T05:42:00.000Z	amphi	DewDude	no need to reboot, evar ;)
2006-05-27T05:42:00.000Z	DewDude	amphi	yeah, i think my problem was i didn't specify the kernel i suspended with, because i think my ndiswrapper conflicts with 686
2006-05-27T05:43:00.000Z	amphi	DewDude	yeah, it's not rocket surgery ;)
2006-05-27T05:44:00.000Z	DewDude	amphi	dual-booting or my suspend issue
2006-05-27T05:44:00.000Z	amphi	DewDude	dual booting
2006-05-27T05:45:00.000Z	amphi	DewDude	I imagine very Bad Things(TM) will happen if you boot a different kernel than you suspended with and manage to get the session to restore
2006-05-27T05:45:00.000Z	DewDude	amphi	yeah, i totally forgot i had done that.
