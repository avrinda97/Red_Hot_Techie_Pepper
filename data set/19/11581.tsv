2005-12-29T08:15:00.000Z	uhuh		just wonderin': which is the easiest linux distro (for installing and configuring)? i'm new to it and don't have too much time to dig into o'reilly books ;)
2005-12-29T08:17:00.000Z	uhuh		yeah, login screen is scrambled. i got a hint to try "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg" which detected the monitor, but still: trouble...
2005-12-29T08:18:00.000Z	Astxist	uhuh	what kind of trouble?
2005-12-29T08:18:00.000Z	uhuh	Astxist	:login screen is scrambled. i only see lines instead of an actual login.
2005-12-29T08:19:00.000Z	Astxist		hmmm
2005-12-29T08:21:00.000Z	Astxist	uhuh	what driver are you using?
2005-12-29T08:22:00.000Z	uhuh	Astxist	i newly installed ubuntu. never got any further than the scrambled login (not even in recovery mode or such)
2005-12-29T08:23:00.000Z	Astxist	uhuh	try editing /etc/X11/xorg.conf and changing the driver to vesa
2005-12-29T08:24:00.000Z	Astxist	uhuh	you can use sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg if editing the conf file is difficult for you
2005-12-29T08:24:00.000Z	uhuh	Astxist	how do i edit this? in the command line, what exactly do i type then to open the conf-file and save/close it??
2005-12-29T08:24:00.000Z	uhuh	Astxist	i did try sudo dpkg-reconfigure and it recognized my monitor, yet didn't do the trick
2005-12-29T08:25:00.000Z	Astxist	uhuh	sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2005-12-29T08:25:00.000Z	Astxist	uhuh	find Section "Device"
2005-12-29T08:26:00.000Z	Astxist	uhuh	and change Driver "<something>" to Driver "vesa"
2005-12-29T08:26:00.000Z	uhuh		alright, i'll give it a shot. it'll be my last one though, getting stressed already ;)
2005-12-29T08:26:00.000Z	Astxist	uhuh	save and restart X
2005-12-29T08:26:00.000Z	uhuh		i'll do that Astxist, thanks!!
2005-12-29T08:27:00.000Z	uhuh		happy holidays y'all, ciao
2005-12-29T08:27:00.000Z	Astxist	uhuh	heh try setting up fglrx then :)
