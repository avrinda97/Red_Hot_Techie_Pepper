2007-05-10T13:05:00.000Z	Geheimnis-		I just updated to Ubuntu 7.04 from Ubuntu 6.06 and now X.org won't start. I have an ati radeon xpress 200m which uses fglrx, but even if I change fglrx to vesa in xorg.conf, it won't load anyway, and even after dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg it still doesn't work, what can I do?
2007-05-10T13:06:00.000Z	psusi	Geheimnis-	boot the livecd and look at the xorg.conf it uses, and use that as a guide to fixing yours
2007-05-10T13:07:00.000Z	Geheimnis-	psusi	ok thanks, I'll try that
2007-05-10T13:08:00.000Z	psusi	Geheimnis-	though the livecd does not use fglrx afaik
2007-05-10T13:08:00.000Z	Geheimnis-	psusi	ok, as long as it doesn't use "ati"
2007-05-10T13:09:00.000Z	psusi	Geheimnis-	that's what it uses... why?
2007-05-10T13:09:00.000Z	psusi	Geheimnis-	at least for me....
2007-05-10T13:09:00.000Z	psusi	Geheimnis-	I have a radeon x850
2007-05-10T13:10:00.000Z	Geheimnis-	psusi	the radeon xpress 200m won't work with ati, anyway in previous versions of Ubuntu it never did
2007-05-10T13:10:00.000Z	Geheimnis-	psusi	mine is a mobility card, for a laptop
2007-05-10T13:10:00.000Z	psusi	Geheimnis-	neither did my x850... does in feisty
2007-05-10T13:10:00.000Z	psusi	Geheimnis-	at least as far as the acceleration goes... I could get it to work before if I shut all that off, but it was dog slow
2007-05-10T13:15:00.000Z	psusi	Geheimnis-	seeing as how it works properly with my video card?  yes...
2007-05-10T13:16:00.000Z	Geheimnis-	psusi	what about the new proprietary driver thingy? does that work well?
2007-05-10T13:16:00.000Z	psusi	Geheimnis-	no idea... I won't use proprietary software if I can help it
2007-05-10T13:18:00.000Z	Geheimnis-	psusi	I have an athlon 64 cpu but I installed the i386 cause in the past I always ran into a problem with the amd64 variant
2007-05-10T13:19:00.000Z	psusi	Geheimnis-	I like to run into problems... only way they will ever get fixed...
2007-05-10T13:20:00.000Z	Geheimnis-	psusi	well, true, I'm just not much of a developer, wish I could help though
2007-05-10T13:20:00.000Z	psusi	Geheimnis-	testing and filing detailed bug reports helps too
