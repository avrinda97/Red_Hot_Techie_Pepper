2011-06-15T00:02:00.000Z	vandemar		I've never even looked at traffic on the wire from a bridged virtualbox to know whether it uses the physical nic's mac
2011-06-15T00:03:00.000Z	vandemar		but I think the multiple dhcp lease requests might still be confusing the router
2011-06-15T00:03:00.000Z	celthunder	vandemar	escott it should use the vm's mac.
2011-06-15T00:04:00.000Z	celthunder	vandemar	escott you can tell it to use the same mac as the host but i SERIOUSLY wouldn't do that...that'd be a good way to fuck up your networking
2011-06-15T00:07:00.000Z	celthunder	vandemar	btw i came in late what're you trying to do with your cable modem? just dhcp passthrough should be easy enough
2011-06-15T00:09:00.000Z	vandemar	celthunder	there's a computer connected directly to a motorola surfboard 5101 connected to cox cable.  There is link on the ethernet interface and packets are being passed both directions according to net statistics, but no dhcp response to the dhcp request.  There is also a winxp VM, bridged, and my current working theory is that the two mac addresses and/or two dhcp requests managed to screw up the dhcp server so it won't hand out addresses to either
2011-06-15T00:10:00.000Z	vandemar	celthunder	I have no way to know if dhcp was working on the host before the vm started, but now it's definitely not.
2011-06-15T00:11:00.000Z	celthunder	vandemar	ok does static addressing work?
2011-06-15T00:11:00.000Z	vandemar	celthunder	I don't know the gateway ip
2011-06-15T00:12:00.000Z	celthunder	vandemar	also if it's a true modem (someone earlier said it was) then you can't use bridging...change that to nat
2011-06-15T00:12:00.000Z	celthunder	vandemar	but either way one of the two should get a dhcp request
2011-06-15T00:12:00.000Z	vandemar	celthunder	one would think, but winxp was reporting no ip address as well
2011-06-15T00:13:00.000Z	celthunder	vandemar	xp at the very LEAST should report a 169 (useless) address
2011-06-15T00:15:00.000Z	vandemar	celthunder	that's what I mean... I didn't actually check the ip address last time I had that VM up, but it was reporting limited/no internet connectivity which I think (but didn't actually look) meant it had assigned a 169 ip
2011-06-15T00:15:00.000Z	celthunder	vandemar	ok so what's the modem currently set to dhcp server, and ppp to the cable company?
2011-06-15T00:16:00.000Z	vandemar	celthunder	it's a motorola surfboard.  it has basically zero configuration options.  afaik it does something, possibly ppp, to the cable company and runs a dhcp server locally
2011-06-15T00:17:00.000Z	celthunder	vandemar	ok you gotta have a gui of some kind at minimum a web interface/telnet option...cna you get to it through either of those
2011-06-15T00:18:00.000Z	celthunder	vandemar	also if you don't know what the gateway is are you SURE it's running a dhcp server?
2011-06-15T00:19:00.000Z	celthunder	vandemar	are you sure it's running a dhcp server?
