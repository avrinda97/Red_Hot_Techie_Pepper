2012-07-19T05:47:00.000Z	LuiX		hey there, i've got some problems with my audio on 12.04 w unity. herse the pulseaudio output: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1099333/
2012-07-19T05:48:00.000Z	glitsj16	LuiX	are you trying pulseaudio equalizer by any chance?

2012-07-19T05:56:00.000Z	glitsj16	LuiX	i hardly vote on anything, only confirming that for me the pulseaudio-equalizer works just fine
2012-07-19T06:00:00.000Z	glitsj16	LuiX	for now you seem to have a misconfigured pulseaudio-equalizer, perhaps try to purge it and see if that gets pulseaudio going again if you decide to keep that .. for the record, just a user trying to enjoy audio on ubuntu, not flame-wars about pulseaudio vs alsa etc
2012-07-19T06:02:00.000Z	glitsj16	LuiX	from the 3 lines in your pastebin that's hard to tell
2012-07-19T06:04:00.000Z	glitsj16	LuiX	it might have been, but that goes for just about anything
2012-07-19T06:35:00.000Z	LuiX	glitsj16	usr13 solved one part of it, reinstalled alsa and pulseaudio and added alias snd-card-0 snd-hda-intel options snd-hda-intel model=auto
2012-07-19T06:36:00.000Z	glitsj16	LuiX	thanks for the info, appreciated
2012-07-19T06:38:00.000Z	glitsj16	LuiX	might help yes
2012-07-19T06:45:00.000Z	LuiX	glitsj16	http://paste.ubuntu.com/1099385/
2012-07-19T06:47:00.000Z	LuiX	glitsj16	when running pulseaudio, the same "failed to load module "module-ladspa-sink"" appears
2012-07-19T06:50:00.000Z	glitsj16	LuiX	could you pastebin your ~/.pulse/default.pa please?
2012-07-19T06:54:00.000Z	glitsj16	LuiX	nice (your succes with pulseaudio and inception both) .. when things go wrong that's quite reasonable yes
2012-07-19T06:55:00.000Z	glitsj16	LuiX	i asked whether you wanted to pastebin your ~/.pulse/default.pa but you were already gone i believe
2012-07-19T06:55:00.000Z	glitsj16	LuiX	so audio-wise all back to normal?
2012-07-19T06:57:00.000Z	LuiX	glitsj16	i don't think that you're gonna need the default.pa, right?
2012-07-19T06:57:00.000Z	glitsj16	LuiX	not if you ditched pulseaudio-equalizer no
2012-07-19T07:02:00.000Z	glitsj16	LuiX	no thanks needed, take care
