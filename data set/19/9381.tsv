2006-11-15T17:17:00.000Z	snessiram		I'm currently running xubuntu but I have some problems with packages when installing not-apt-get programs and I'm currently thinking maybe debian would be better in that case... what do you guys think?
2006-11-15T17:19:00.000Z	snessiram		Anyone an opinion? ubuntu >< debian
2006-11-15T17:19:00.000Z	cfedde	snessiram	I pick ubunutu server over debian these days.
2006-11-15T17:20:00.000Z	cfedde	snessiram	I'm happy with ubuntu on my lappy.
2006-11-15T17:21:00.000Z	cfedde	snessiram	then it sounds like you have a special case.
2006-11-15T17:22:00.000Z	snessiram	cfedde	I had a similar problem when I wanted to install cinelerra a year or so ago
2006-11-15T17:22:00.000Z	cfedde	snessiram	welcome to the wonderful world of computers.
2006-11-15T17:24:00.000Z	cfedde	snessiram	of course it's possible for packages to conflict.
2006-11-15T17:25:00.000Z	snessiram	cfedde	maybe it has something to do with a difference between ubuntu and xubuntu install, because the .deb file I downloaded for the program was made for ubuntu edgy
2006-11-15T17:26:00.000Z	cfedde	snessiram	if you find .deb that don't have some of the dependencies, my usual mode of operation is to start hunting for clues by googling for the errormessages I'm getting.
2006-11-15T17:27:00.000Z	snessiram	cfedde	I do that too ;)
2006-11-15T17:30:00.000Z	snessiram	cfedde	It just gives dependency probs (Package python-dbus is not installed. AND  Package python-gnome2-extras is not installed.)
2006-11-15T17:31:00.000Z	cfedde	snessiram	what happens when you install those?
2006-11-15T17:32:00.000Z	snessiram	cfedde	for python-dbus: when looking in synaptic, "python2.3-dbus" is installed
2006-11-15T17:34:00.000Z	cfedde	snessiram	sorry.  Wish I could be more help.  do you have universe and multiverse repositories enabled?
2006-11-15T17:35:00.000Z	snessiram	cfedde	I'm using (normally :P) the repositories of ubuntuguide.org
2006-11-15T17:39:00.000Z	snessiram	cfedde	You're not going to believe this, I uncommented original sources again....and scribus just is in apt-get... just installed... just spent 4 hours on that...
2006-11-15T17:40:00.000Z	cfedde	snessiram	YOU WIN!
2006-11-15T17:40:00.000Z	snessiram	cfedde	or not :'(
