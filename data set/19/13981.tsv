2004-11-27T12:04:00.000Z	supos	crack	man rm
2004-11-27T12:09:00.000Z	supos	crack	rm is a command that deletes (removes) files. The syntax is "rm 'file you want to delete'"
2004-11-27T12:10:00.000Z	supos	crack	if you want to delete a directory and everything in it, you must use the '-r' (for recursively) parameter like this "rm -r 'directory you want to delete'"
2004-11-27T12:11:00.000Z	supos	crack	Now, as a normal user, you don't have permission to delete files belonging to root (the super-user), so you must use sudo, which lets you execute a command as the super-user
2004-11-27T12:12:00.000Z	supos	crack	delete is not a command!
2004-11-27T12:12:00.000Z	supos	crack	Read what I just wrote to you
2004-11-27T12:15:00.000Z	supos	crack	So, to sum it up: 'sudo rm -r somedirectory', will execute the command 'rm -r somedirectory' as root (the super-user). Now, 'rm -r somedirectory' removes somedirectory recursively, which is what you want
2004-11-27T12:16:00.000Z	supos	crack	now if you do 'sudo rm -rf /', you will delete everything on your harddisk - so don't do that.
