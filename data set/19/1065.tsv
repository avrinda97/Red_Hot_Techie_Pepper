2011-05-22T01:31:00.000Z	roothorick	FJAA-1983	what card? Do you need VA API or Crossfire?
2011-05-22T01:32:00.000Z	FJAA-1983	roothorick	ATI HD 6960 I think.
2011-05-22T01:33:00.000Z	roothorick	FJAA-1983	you think? I highly doubt you'd have a high-end enthusiast card like that and not know about it
2011-05-22T01:33:00.000Z	roothorick	FJAA-1983	double-check with lspci
2011-05-22T01:33:00.000Z	FJAA-1983	roothorick	Just got it. :-P
2011-05-22T01:34:00.000Z	roothorick	FJAA-1983	that's what the box says? 6960?
2011-05-22T01:34:00.000Z	FJAA-1983	roothorick	6950, me bad.
2011-05-22T01:35:00.000Z	roothorick	FJAA-1983	northern islands chipset... bad news
2011-05-22T01:35:00.000Z	FJAA-1983	roothorick	Please elaborate on that?
2011-05-22T01:36:00.000Z	roothorick	FJAA-1983	actually... http://xorg.freedesktop.org/wiki/RadeonFeature
2011-05-22T01:36:00.000Z	roothorick	FJAA-1983	try the radeon driver
2011-05-22T01:39:00.000Z	roothorick	FJAA-1983	you'll actually need 2.6.39 or later for your card, heh
2011-05-22T01:39:00.000Z	FJAA-1983	roothorick	I'm on 2.6.39. It was fine with 2.6.38 until i updated. :-)
2011-05-22T01:40:00.000Z	FJAA-1983	roothorick	I don't know if my logic is failing me, but I'm kind of sensing that you're trying to imply that my card is going to be a pain in the low part of my back.
2011-05-22T01:41:00.000Z	roothorick	FJAA-1983	oh indeed it will be. There's a reason Linux enthusiasts avoid ATI/AMD GPUs like the plague.
2011-05-22T01:42:00.000Z	FJAA-1983	roothorick	Darn, I really did not know that. I did read it was a little... messy, but not that it would be such a pain.
2011-05-22T01:43:00.000Z	roothorick	FJAA-1983	well, fglrx driver is notoriously buggy, to the point of being outright unusable in certain situations... and the open source driver (radeon) is still somewhat limited
2011-05-22T01:43:00.000Z	roothorick	FJAA-1983	I had a 4850, it was a nightmare. I now have exclusively nVIDIA and Intel silicon, so much easier, though the Intel stuff is understandably limited in capability
2011-05-22T01:44:00.000Z	FJAA-1983	roothorick	It pains me to hear that when I use ubuntu as my main OS. The "other" one is just for gaming (Not even office applications installed)
