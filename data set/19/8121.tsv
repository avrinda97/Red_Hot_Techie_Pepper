2007-08-02T09:34:00.000Z	MajorPayne	Punkunity	Right click it and click something like "save to disk".
2007-08-02T09:34:00.000Z	MajorPayne	Punkunity	On the link that is.
2007-08-02T09:35:00.000Z	MajorPayne	Punkunity	Ugg, don't make me open firefox.  It almost has to be there.  Either that or you could just copy it and paste it into a file.
2007-08-02T09:35:00.000Z	MajorPayne	Punkunity	Save link as maybe?
2007-08-02T09:36:00.000Z	MajorPayne	Punkunity	Ok, that should work fine.

2007-08-02T09:39:00.000Z	MajorPayne	Punkunity	Heh, I don't either.

2007-08-02T09:40:00.000Z	MajorPayne	Punkunity	Humm.  Maybe you saved it somewhere else, home directory?
2007-08-02T09:41:00.000Z	MajorPayne	Punkunity	Don't worry about it.
2007-08-02T09:43:00.000Z	MajorPayne	Punkunity	No problem.
