2007-03-16T14:35:00.000Z	qebab		anyone want to give me a bit of help?
2007-03-16T14:35:00.000Z	qebab		ok :)
2007-03-16T14:35:00.000Z	qebab		I mounted a shared drive with smbmount
2007-03-16T14:35:00.000Z	qebab		and by mistake I mounted it in ~
2007-03-16T14:35:00.000Z	qebab		don't ask me why :|
2007-03-16T14:35:00.000Z	qebab		now, naturally everything there disappeared
2007-03-16T14:35:00.000Z	qebab		did I just lose everything I had in ~ then?
2007-03-16T14:36:00.000Z	qebab		help! :(
2007-03-16T14:37:00.000Z	qebab		guys? I can't open terminal/any apps
2007-03-16T14:37:00.000Z	qebab		which strikes me as 'bad'
2007-03-16T14:38:00.000Z	bruenig	qebab	can you alt + f2
2007-03-16T14:39:00.000Z	qebab	bruenig	nothing runs though
2007-03-16T14:39:00.000Z	bruenig	qebab	the run dialog comes up though?
2007-03-16T14:40:00.000Z	bruenig	qebab	well something runs then
2007-08-25T05:57:00.000Z	bruenig	qebab	just use the package management of mandriva, there is not much difference
2007-08-25T05:58:00.000Z	qebab	bruenig	I guess I'm just too used to apt-get
2007-08-25T05:58:00.000Z	bruenig	qebab	it is kind of a silly comparison then to say you missed something which is completely replicated but in a different way
2007-08-25T05:58:00.000Z	qebab	bruenig	possibly :)
2007-08-25T05:59:00.000Z	qebab	bruenig	I still have mandriva and I'll give it another chance, but this is hardly the channel for that discussion
