2007-03-28T09:42:00.000Z	freshmeat		Why the hell is Q3 so clunky when I run it in Ubuntu?
2007-03-28T09:42:00.000Z	freshmeat		It's terribly clunky.
2007-03-28T09:42:00.000Z	freshmeat		I'm using a Dell Inspiron 1200 laptop.
2007-03-28T09:43:00.000Z	freshmeat		How would it be possible for me to run Q3 in a small window?
2007-03-28T09:43:00.000Z	freshmeat		Are there any switches that I could use?
2007-03-28T09:44:00.000Z	freshmeat		Any suggestions here in the channel on what I could do?
2007-03-28T09:46:00.000Z	Yasumoto	freshmeat	hm. I'm not sure what the system requirements are for Q3, but that might be your problem
2007-03-28T09:46:00.000Z	Yasumoto	freshmeat	really? that's trippy. are you using wine?
2007-03-28T09:46:00.000Z	freshmeat	Yasumoto	maybe I should try running it windowed?
2007-03-28T09:47:00.000Z	freshmeat	Yasumoto	nope.
2007-03-28T09:47:00.000Z	freshmeat	Yasumoto	well, it's not that small.
2007-03-28T09:48:00.000Z	freshmeat	Yasumoto	it takes about a quarter of my screen, with the rest being black.
2007-03-28T09:48:00.000Z	Yasumoto	freshmeat	i'm not sure that running it windowed will help, but have you tried dropping the game's resolution/decreasing graphical bells/whistles?
2007-03-28T09:48:00.000Z	freshmeat	Yasumoto	I'll give that a shot.
2007-03-28T09:48:00.000Z	freshmeat	Yasumoto	I doubt it's the RAM, however...
2007-03-28T09:48:00.000Z	Yasumoto	freshmeat	ah, alright
2007-03-28T09:49:00.000Z	freshmeat	Yasumoto	it may the the GL driver that I'm using.
2007-03-28T09:49:00.000Z	Yasumoto	freshmeat	(256 isn't that much though ... X_X)
2007-03-28T09:52:00.000Z	Yasumoto	freshmeat	I just did a quick google search, but didn't really find anything. I've gotta head to class, but good luck getting it to work
