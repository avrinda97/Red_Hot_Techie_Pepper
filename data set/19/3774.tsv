2010-01-20T04:20:00.000Z	mkanyicy	goose	nope
2010-01-20T04:10:00.000Z	mkanyicy	goose	ssh will do that for you
2010-01-20T04:11:00.000Z	mkanyicy	goose	why do you want to know your public key before you connect?
2010-01-20T04:11:00.000Z	goose	mkanyicy	I know, I've created bash aliases for doing that with SSH, but I need to do it with GUI SCP.
2010-01-20T04:11:00.000Z	goose	mkanyicy	because I have 14 RSA keys
2010-01-20T04:11:00.000Z	mkanyicy	goose	why do you have 14 keys?
2010-01-20T04:12:00.000Z	goose	mkanyicy	because I have 14 different servers I regularly SSH into. Do you know how I can identify an RSA key with GUI SCP, or are you just questioning me?
2010-01-20T04:15:00.000Z	mkanyicy	goose	what is the backend of Connect to Server?
2010-01-20T04:16:00.000Z	goose	mkanyicy	Nautalis, I suppose?
2010-01-20T04:16:00.000Z	mkanyicy	goose	tried filezilla ?
2010-01-20T04:18:00.000Z	goose	mkanyicy	sounds like a Mozilla application? Ubuntu has a perfectly usable GUI SSH tool built into it, I just need to know how to identify an RSA key to use with it
2010-01-20T04:18:00.000Z	mkanyicy	goose	but I dont really see the need to use 14 public keys if you are connecting to 14 servers, what happens if you tripple that to about 50 servers, you would want 50 keys? that's ridiculous
2010-01-20T04:19:00.000Z	goose	mkanyicy	as opposed to using one key for all of them? seems like a major security fault to me
2010-01-20T04:20:00.000Z	mkanyicy	goose	how? it's a PUBLIC key
2010-01-20T04:20:00.000Z	goose	mkanyicy	if someone breaks it, they have access to all of your servers, rather than just one
2010-01-20T04:21:00.000Z	mkanyicy	goose	he would need to have the private key as well
2010-01-20T04:22:00.000Z	mkanyicy	goose	i mean , thats why ssh is called ssh, 100 keys for 100 servers is not worth it
2010-01-20T04:22:00.000Z	mkanyicy	goose	unless you are working for millitary
2010-01-20T04:23:00.000Z	mkanyicy	goose	anyway good luck
