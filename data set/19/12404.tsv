2005-09-13T15:45:00.000Z	HiddenWolf	pawdro	Breezy is still a development version tho, so it might not work out of the box just yet.

2005-09-13T15:47:00.000Z	HiddenWolf	pawdro	ubuntu and gnome have a coupled release schedule. every 6 months, both release. Stable versions only get bugfixes.
2005-09-13T15:48:00.000Z	HiddenWolf	pawdro	trust me, you don't want to compile 2.12 on Hoary, so much has changed in the underlying structure, it's far better to upgrade.
2005-09-13T15:49:00.000Z	pawdro	HiddenWolf	ok i wont do it
