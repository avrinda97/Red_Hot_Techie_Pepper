2011-09-03T22:49:00.000Z	kyan		How can I change /etc/fstab with it being read-only?
2011-09-03T22:49:00.000Z	theadmin	kyan	Should be something like this for your root: /dev/sda1 / ext4 defaults 1 1
2011-09-03T22:50:00.000Z	theadmin	kyan	Ah, that.
2011-09-03T22:50:00.000Z	theadmin	kyan	Run this first: mount -o remount,rw /
2011-09-03T22:50:00.000Z	theadmin	kyan	Might need sudo
2011-09-03T22:50:00.000Z	kyan	theadmin	Cool, thanks.
2011-09-03T22:51:00.000Z	kyan	theadmin	The reason I got into that fix was because I had to write my fstab from scratch and had no idea how :-D just using a couple of reference guides from the internet
2011-09-03T23:12:00.000Z	theadmin	kyan	Do you have a separate /usr or /home partitions?
2011-09-03T23:12:00.000Z	theadmin	kyan	Make sure fstab mounts those properly
2011-09-03T23:13:00.000Z	kyan	theadmin	No I do not.
2011-09-03T23:13:00.000Z	kyan	theadmin	Only one partition, occupying the entire drive, mounted at /
2011-09-03T23:13:00.000Z	theadmin	kyan	I see.
2011-09-03T23:14:00.000Z	theadmin	kyan	That looks odd, but okayish... Try sudo modprobe -r vboxdrv to unload virtualbox's drivers, those bug out from time to time
2011-09-03T23:16:00.000Z	theadmin	kyan	Rebooting the host won't help anyone
2011-09-03T23:52:00.000Z	kyan	theadmin	Sorry, the client just died again. Third time was the charm! Unfortunately, while it has booted now, compiz is not starting. :-( Compare the appearance of the windows in the vm and the host here: http://image.bayimg.com/najdaaado.jpg
2011-09-03T23:52:00.000Z	kyan	theadmin	the host has compiz working, while the vm doesn't. Any idea why, or how to fix it?
2011-09-03T23:52:00.000Z	theadmin	kyan	Nope
2011-09-03T23:53:00.000Z	kyan	theadmin	The error message compiz produced when starting is shown in the terminal window in the vm. Okayâ€¦
2011-09-03T23:53:00.000Z	kyan	theadmin	thanks.
