2012-02-24T12:05:00.000Z	chipotle		what applications can i use to use ubuntu as a file server?
2012-02-24T12:06:00.000Z	kriskropd	chipotle	or samba or nfs
2012-02-24T12:06:00.000Z	chipotle	kriskropd	yeah, but is there an interface/application to make it easy?
2012-02-24T12:06:00.000Z	kriskropd	chipotle	depending ont he protocol, i like Gigolo on my netbook
2012-02-24T12:08:00.000Z	kriskropd	chipotle	wherever you moutn them, /mnt /media, Gigolo is more temporary so itll put them in ~/.gvfs
2012-02-24T12:21:00.000Z	kriskropd	chipotle	you likely have permissions mixed up and given to different people, when you move the files, make sure to use 'sudo' to do it as root
2012-02-24T12:21:00.000Z	chipotle	kriskropd	so if i sudo it, what will the permissions be changed to?
2012-02-24T12:21:00.000Z	chipotle	kriskropd	i want to make sure when i do sudo cp -r it works so when i wake up, it is finished
2012-02-24T12:23:00.000Z	chipotle	kriskropd	well, should i chown the files to myself first?
2012-02-24T12:24:00.000Z	kriskropd	chipotle	you don't have to chown the files... are you moving a /home directory to another drive or somethign else?
2012-02-24T12:25:00.000Z	chipotle	kriskropd	it is a drive out of my mac laptop, i want to copy it to this larger drive on my ubuntu machine
2012-02-24T12:26:00.000Z	kriskropd	chipotle	you are only copying the files, not modifying them
2012-02-24T12:27:00.000Z	chipotle	kriskropd	i tried to copy and i'm still getting a permission denied
2012-02-24T12:28:00.000Z	chipotle	kriskropd	when i copy it, it still says owned by root and i can't access it...
2012-02-24T12:29:00.000Z	kriskropd	chipotle	sudo wont let you move root files around?
2012-02-24T12:29:00.000Z	chipotle	kriskropd	the file i am taking it from isn't a root file; the file was made on an entirely diferent computer and network
2012-02-24T12:30:00.000Z	kriskropd	chipotle	I don't see how that should make the file immovable if it is being accessed by your machine by root
2012-02-24T12:30:00.000Z	chipotle	kriskropd	i moved it but i can't access it because now it is owned by root
