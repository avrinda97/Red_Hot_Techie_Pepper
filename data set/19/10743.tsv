2007-01-12T08:51:00.000Z	Hoobly		I am having a real b*tch of a time getting edubuntu 6.10 to run on my machine.  Can someone make some suggestions?
2007-01-12T08:51:00.000Z	Hoobly		Everything installs fine, but when I go to boot, immediately after the memory check and disk initialization I get a blinking cursor and nothing else.
2007-01-12T08:52:00.000Z	mneptok	Hoobly	platform? motherboard? type of drive? partitioning schema?
2007-01-12T08:52:00.000Z	Hoobly	mneptok	default partition scheme.  Erase entire disk and use LVM.  it is a IBM Netvista 6350-11U machine
2007-01-12T08:56:00.000Z	mneptok	Hoobly	wait, do you even see a GRUB boot screen?
2007-01-12T08:57:00.000Z	Hoobly	mneptok	no GRUB screen
2007-01-12T08:57:00.000Z	Hoobly	mneptok	Just a blinking cursor
2007-01-12T08:58:00.000Z	mneptok	Hoobly	re-install, but create a 250MB partition *outside of LVM* and *at the beginning of the disk*
2007-01-12T08:59:00.000Z	mneptok	Hoobly	uso that 250MB for /boot
2007-01-12T08:59:00.000Z	mneptok	Hoobly	s/uso use
2007-01-12T08:59:00.000Z	Hoobly	mneptok	huh?
2007-01-12T09:00:00.000Z	mneptok	Hoobly	make a seperate partition to use as /boot. create that partition outside of LVM. put it at the beginning of the disk.
2007-01-12T09:21:00.000Z	Hoobly	mneptok	when I create the /boot partition, do I automatically partition the rest of the "Free Space"?
2007-01-12T09:22:00.000Z	Hoobly	mneptok	Do I also have to set the bootable flag?
2007-01-12T09:22:00.000Z	mneptok	Hoobly	how much RAM?
2007-01-12T09:22:00.000Z	Hoobly	mneptok	256mb
2007-01-12T09:24:00.000Z	mneptok	Hoobly	| /boot (250MB marked bootable) | swap space (1GB) || LVM | / (10GB) | /home (remainder | ||
2007-01-12T09:25:00.000Z	Hoobly	mneptok	I'll try that
2007-01-12T12:04:00.000Z	Hoobly	mneptok	OK.  Installed but still just a blinking cursor when booting.
