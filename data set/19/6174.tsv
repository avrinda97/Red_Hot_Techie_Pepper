2008-03-02T20:27:00.000Z	lenswipe		I just installed SMF (Simple machines forums) on my ubuntu server. Thing is, i want to install mods. SMF is asking me for FTP server details before it goes to install the mods (WITH NO ALTERNATIVES) so it can chmod a few files so the mods can be installed. This is fine isnt it?
2008-03-02T20:27:00.000Z	lenswipe		Just install proftpd and ur done.
2008-03-02T20:27:00.000Z	lenswipe		Right?
2008-03-02T20:27:00.000Z	lenswipe		Wrong.
