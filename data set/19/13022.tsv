2005-05-28T08:50:00.000Z	r0d		the 32bit gentoo is good, just their 64 needs some more apps
2005-05-28T08:50:00.000Z	bassinboy	r0d	i USE="~amd64"
2005-05-28T08:51:00.000Z	r0d	bassinboy	different from march?

2005-05-28T08:53:00.000Z	bassinboy	r0d	*shrugs*.. lemme mount my gentoo partition
2005-05-28T08:54:00.000Z	bassinboy	r0d	CFLAGS="-march=athlon64
2005-05-28T08:55:00.000Z	r0d	bassinboy	i have CFLAGS="march=k8"
2005-05-28T08:56:00.000Z	bassinboy	r0d	oh, it doesn't matter really, but you might want it -march and not march
2005-05-28T08:57:00.000Z	bassinboy	r0d	indeed, portage (emerge) is the best of the best
2005-05-28T08:58:00.000Z	bassinboy	r0d	yeah, lets say gaim takes about 5 minutes to compile, but it's worth it, it has crashed on me like, once, in a year or so. and i use unstable
2005-05-28T08:58:00.000Z	bassinboy	r0d	lol, you comfigure your own hardware on gentoo ;)
2005-05-28T08:59:00.000Z	bassinboy	r0d	Yes, you must have used stage3? ewww...
2005-05-28T08:59:00.000Z	bassinboy	r0d	did you go by the 2005.0 handbook ?
2005-05-28T09:00:00.000Z	bassinboy	r0d	i haven't really read that one but i know it isn't that good, it is more easy and fast, but the other ones show you how to build your own kernel, which are more personal and a lot faster
2005-05-28T09:02:00.000Z	bassinboy	r0d	g2g, if you want to chat, my channel is #gentoo-texas ......... and stage one takes a few hours on athlon 64, and i have 1 gig dual chan memory
