2009-07-01T01:35:00.000Z	masmos		hello, good evening! i have a short question. i installed ubuntu 8.04 on the old computer of my father. but i'm not satified with the resolution of 800x600 ? how can i change it?
2009-07-01T01:36:00.000Z	MK13	masmos	install the drivers for your graphics card
2009-07-01T01:36:00.000Z	masmos	MK13	thats the problem! i don't know how to do.
2009-07-01T01:37:00.000Z	masmos	MK13	i do not even know the name of the graphic card
2009-07-01T01:39:00.000Z	MK13	masmos	look in the system menu and there should be a device drivers listed, click that and ubuntu might already have a driver available
2009-07-01T01:41:00.000Z	masmos	MK13	there is a menu  "Hardware-driver"; and than theres written there are no properitie drivers on your system
2009-07-01T01:44:00.000Z	MK13	masmos	sorry had to go get my laptop w/ ubuntu (this computer is too slow to run it)
2009-07-01T01:45:00.000Z	MK13	masmos	in the terminal of the computer do an lspci and copy what is sent back to pastebin then give me the url
2009-07-01T01:46:00.000Z	masmos	MK13	i'm not sure if i understood well
2009-07-01T01:46:00.000Z	masmos	MK13	like this http://pastebin.com/d748c927e
2009-07-01T01:49:00.000Z	masmos	MK13	did you got the link
2009-07-01T01:50:00.000Z	MK13	masmos	do the same thing only this time run "dmesg"
2009-07-01T01:51:00.000Z	MK13	masmos	from your lspci print out it looks like "ATI Technologies Inc Rage 128 RL/VR AGP" is your graphics card
2009-07-01T01:52:00.000Z	MK13	masmos	and you don't have options higher than 800x600 in the screen resolution selection right? (i assumed this by accident)

2009-07-01T01:53:00.000Z	masmos	MK13	yes i don't have options higher than 800x600; what can i do?
2009-07-01T01:57:00.000Z	masmos	MK13	whats up???
2009-07-01T02:00:00.000Z	masmos	MK13	what do i have to do? which driver?
2009-07-01T02:04:00.000Z	masmos	MK13	yes it is!
