2005-11-02T12:13:00.000Z	tritium	Mabus06	how is it not installed right?
2005-11-02T12:14:00.000Z	tritium	Mabus06	you can reconfigure it with "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg"
2005-11-02T12:15:00.000Z	tritium	Mabus06	"won't load" doesn't convey that to me.  Please be more specific.
2005-11-02T12:16:00.000Z	tritium	Mabus06	what errors are you seeing, and where?
2005-11-02T12:27:00.000Z	tritium	Mabus06	did you setup the binary nvidia drivers?  What have you done so far?  can you paste your /var/log/Xorg.0.log on pastebin?  Did you follow the BinaryDriverHowto?
2005-11-02T12:28:00.000Z	tritium	Mabus06	fair enough.  Can you look in /var/log/Xorg.0.log for (EE), which indicate errors?
2005-11-02T14:29:00.000Z	Mabus06	tritium	it freezes at hotplug subsystem whether or not I fresh install with the geforce
2005-11-02T14:29:00.000Z	tritium	Mabus06	doesn't sound like an issue with your geforce then

2005-12-21T14:12:00.000Z	tritium	Mabus06	it has to do with the code of conduct, and how we treat others in the channel
2005-12-21T14:14:00.000Z	tritium	Mabus06	you can still talk with him in a query
2005-12-21T14:16:00.000Z	tritium	Mabus06	there...
