2007-11-02T19:19:00.000Z	proprietarysucks	Jonah_	you need to not try to fix your system using graphical tools
2007-11-02T19:20:00.000Z	proprietarysucks	Jonah_	to start, go to terminal and pastbin me the output of ifconfig
2007-11-02T19:21:00.000Z	Jonah_	proprietarysucks	ok but exiting gdm wasn't giving me a prompt, i booted into recovery mode and changed boot manager to boot in 791 vga mode instead to see if i can see a prompt with taht instead
2007-11-02T19:21:00.000Z	proprietarysucks	Jonah_	exit gdm? dude... press alt-f2 and type in xterm
2007-11-02T19:22:00.000Z	Jonah_	proprietarysucks	yeah that's what i did - no prompt, so i figured resolution maybe not set right, my bootmanager file was set to vga=771, so just check 791 corrects this
2007-11-02T19:22:00.000Z	proprietarysucks	Jonah_	I didn't say ctrl-alt-f2, I said alt-f2 and type in xterm
2007-11-02T19:23:00.000Z	proprietarysucks	Jonah_	stop thinking so much, look down press alt and f2 together. a box will come up. without looking at it just press x t e r m (enter)
2007-11-02T19:24:00.000Z	Jonah_	proprietarysucks	oh you mean the run dialog?? i'm with you, ok that's great, gives me a terminal thanks, still not sure what to do though
2007-11-02T19:24:00.000Z	proprietarysucks	Jonah_	thanks for listening. now type ifconfig(enter)
2007-11-02T19:25:00.000Z	Jonah_	proprietarysucks	ok that doesn't seem to do anything
2007-11-02T19:25:00.000Z	proprietarysucks	Jonah_	try  sudo ifconfig(enter)
2007-11-02T19:26:00.000Z	proprietarysucks	Jonah_	then you have to enter your password
2007-11-02T19:27:00.000Z	Jonah_	proprietarysucks	oh man, this is awful, the alt-f2 only works one time, then xterm wont run again
2007-11-02T19:27:00.000Z	Jonah_	proprietarysucks	so i have no terminal again, and can't do anything
2007-11-02T19:27:00.000Z	proprietarysucks	Jonah_	try alt-f2 and then type in gnome-terminal(enter)
2007-11-02T19:28:00.000Z	Jonah_	proprietarysucks	that also does nothing, can we fix it from recovery mode?? as at the moment it won't let me do much of anything
2007-11-02T19:29:00.000Z	proprietarysucks	Jonah_	if you can't open a terminal, can't run commands, can't open a different tty, you are basically screwed
2007-11-02T19:29:00.000Z	proprietarysucks	Jonah_	you can do rescue and such but that's beyond what I'm going to do with you, good luck
2007-11-02T19:30:00.000Z	Jonah_	proprietarysucks	well if i boot recovery mode, is there a why to remove  driver you install, like i did a make build then make install, and i don't think it really install fully or something, is there a way to strip it back out?
