2006-08-20T13:22:00.000Z	sethk	HanzZ	that's foolish.  there is only one mbr that matters, the one on /dev/hda
2006-08-20T13:25:00.000Z	sethk	HanzZ	that makes no sense at all
2006-08-20T13:26:00.000Z	sethk	HanzZ	by that logic, if you install ubuntu on /dev/hdb1 you would use the mbr on /dev/hdb
2006-08-20T13:26:00.000Z	sethk	HanzZ	which is obvious nonsense.  such an idea about sda is equally obviously nonsense
2006-08-20T13:28:00.000Z	HanzZ	sethk	it's another situation... whet you install ubuntu on /dev/sda, then bootloader will be on /dev/hda......
2006-08-20T13:28:00.000Z	HanzZ	sethk	by default...
2006-08-20T13:29:00.000Z	HanzZ	sethk	and this is wrong i think...
2006-08-20T13:29:00.000Z	sethk	HanzZ	no, it isn't wrong
2006-08-20T13:29:00.000Z	sethk	HanzZ	what you don't understand is that it is _not_ a different situation.
2006-08-20T13:29:00.000Z	sethk	HanzZ	the only  mbr that matters is the one the bios uses to boot the machine.
2006-08-20T13:30:00.000Z	sethk	HanzZ	it makes no difference which piece of hardware you happen to choose to put anything on, be it linux or ubuntu or any other o/s
2006-08-20T13:35:00.000Z	HanzZ	sethk	my /dev/hda has 500MB and /dev/sda 80GB... where can i install ubuntu?
2006-08-20T13:35:00.000Z	sethk	HanzZ	you can install anywhere you like
2006-08-20T13:35:00.000Z	sethk	HanzZ	that has nothing to do with which boot sector should be modified
2006-08-20T13:48:00.000Z	HanzZ	sethk	what about this ? https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/grub/+bug/8497
2006-08-20T13:48:00.000Z	HanzZ	sethk	this is normal?
2006-08-20T13:48:00.000Z	sethk	HanzZ	what about it?  I don't believe it's correct.  you do.
2006-08-20T13:49:00.000Z	sethk	HanzZ	yes
2006-08-20T13:49:00.000Z	HanzZ	sethk	sry :)
