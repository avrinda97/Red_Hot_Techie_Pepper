2006-09-05T10:33:00.000Z	cafuego		You have gtk 2.4
2006-09-05T10:33:00.000Z	cafuego		Your problem is that you're missing the gtk headers.
2006-09-05T10:34:00.000Z	tuxtheslacker	cafuego	where would I get the headers?
2006-09-05T10:35:00.000Z	cafuego	tuxtheslacker	'apt-cache search libgtk | grep -- -dev' would be a start.
2006-09-05T10:36:00.000Z	tuxtheslacker	cafuego	that spits out a ton of packages.
2006-09-05T10:36:00.000Z	cafuego	tuxtheslacker	What do you think of the dexcription for the fourth one from the bottom?
2006-09-05T10:37:00.000Z	tuxtheslacker	cafuego	only technically....
2006-09-05T10:37:00.000Z	cafuego	tuxtheslacker	Then technically you'll need them <heh>
2006-09-05T10:38:00.000Z	tuxtheslacker	cafuego	libgtkmm-2.4-dev - C++ wrappers for GTK+ 2.4 (development files)
2006-09-05T10:38:00.000Z	cafuego	tuxtheslacker	and the package version is 2.8.17
2006-09-05T10:38:00.000Z	tuxtheslacker	cafuego	can you send me the exact name of the package I want? becuase I dont' knw where I should be looking.
2006-09-05T10:39:00.000Z	cafuego	tuxtheslacker	I think you'll find libgtkmm-2.4-dev depends on libgtk2.0-dev
2006-09-05T10:39:00.000Z	cafuego	tuxtheslacker	So either way
2006-09-05T10:45:00.000Z	cafuego	tuxtheslacker	apt-cache search ...
2006-09-05T10:45:00.000Z	tuxtheslacker	cafuego	yeah, again, it's spitting out a ton of crap, and I need the headers.
2006-09-05T10:46:00.000Z	cafuego	tuxtheslacker	'apt-cache search ssl | grep -- -dev' then.
2006-09-05T10:46:00.000Z	cafuego	tuxtheslacker	You need to do a *little* bit of the hard work if you insist on compiling stuff.
2006-09-05T10:47:00.000Z	tuxtheslacker	cafuego	it's not that, I just have no idea which package I need :-). It's kinda annoying that ubuntu doesn't ship wiht the headers for these files... like build-essential should come with it, do you not think?
2006-09-05T10:48:00.000Z	cafuego	tuxtheslacker	Not really, it wouldn't fit on the CD and most people would have no need of them. Plus they EAT disk space.
