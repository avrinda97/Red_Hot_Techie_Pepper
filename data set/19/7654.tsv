2007-07-17T10:01:00.000Z	ethan		My X stopped working after a restart, I'm getting this error:  (EE) NVIDIA(0): Failed to load the NVIDIA kernel module!
2007-07-17T10:01:00.000Z	ethan		I have nvidia-glx and linux-restricted-modules installed
2007-07-17T10:02:00.000Z	abernanit	ethan	did this happen immediately after you installed nvidia-glx?
2007-07-17T10:02:00.000Z	abernanit		I'm having a similar problem if I have acpi=off
2007-07-17T10:02:00.000Z	ethan	abernanit	this happened after I left my computer off for the week and started up.
2007-07-17T10:02:00.000Z	ethan	abernanit	I've had nvidia and X working fine for years
2007-07-17T10:03:00.000Z	abernanit		hmm, I'm not sure then  (is newbie)
2007-07-17T10:03:00.000Z	ethan	abernanit	just randomly after this power up, X doesn't work, first I got an error about an api mismatch (nvida kernel can't run on the xorg kernel, different versions)
2007-07-17T10:03:00.000Z	abernanit		I've been having some X problems as well, though I'm uncertain of the cause
2007-07-17T10:04:00.000Z	ethan	abernanit	I tried apt-get updating and dist-upgrading, but nothing new, are the repos messed up with dependencies incorrect regarding X?
2007-07-17T10:04:00.000Z	abernanit		Unsure, the only temporary fix I know was reverting my drivers back to the standard nv drivers
2007-07-17T10:05:00.000Z	ethan		hmm
2007-07-17T10:05:00.000Z	ethan		I run compiz abernanit
2007-07-17T10:06:00.000Z	ethan	abernanit	nope, that didn't work
2007-07-17T10:06:00.000Z	ethan	abernanit	I changed to nv, nothing is different.
2007-07-17T10:06:00.000Z	ethan	abernanit	(EE) Unable to find a valid framebuffer device
2007-07-17T10:06:00.000Z	ethan		(EE) NV(0): Failed to open framebuffer device, consult warnings and/or errors above for possible reasons
2007-07-17T10:07:00.000Z	abernanit	ethan	I'm not sure what to do then, sorry
2007-07-17T10:07:00.000Z	abernanit	ethan	I've only had ubuntu installed for two days :) and most of this is very new to me
