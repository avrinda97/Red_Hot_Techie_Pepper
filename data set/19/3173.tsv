2010-06-30T07:10:00.000Z	Agu10		hi
2010-06-30T07:10:00.000Z	Agu10		how can I start ubuntu without apic enabled?
2010-06-30T07:10:00.000Z	codebrainz	Agu10	in grub on boot, pass 'noapic' on the kernel arguments line
2010-06-30T07:11:00.000Z	Agu10	codebrainz	don't know what the kernel arg line is... is it the last one in the boot script?
2010-06-30T07:12:00.000Z	codebrainz	Agu10	it's on the line with kernel root=UUID=blah splash quiet, etc
2010-06-30T07:12:00.000Z	codebrainz	Agu10	are you booting the livecd or an install?
2010-06-30T07:13:00.000Z	Agu10	codebrainz	an installed one
2010-07-03T04:57:00.000Z	codebrainz	Agu10	Settings->Appearances->Visual Effects->Extra is probably the easiest
2010-07-03T04:57:00.000Z	Agu10	codebrainz	no, because I'd loose my compiz config
2010-07-03T04:58:00.000Z	codebrainz	Agu10	it will load whatever you've set in compiz config settings manager
2010-07-03T04:58:00.000Z	Agu10	codebrainz	are you sure? I once did that, and it disabled all the plugins, if I remember right
2010-07-03T04:59:00.000Z	codebrainz	Agu10	no i'm not sure, but worse case scenario, you spend 2 minutes reconfiguring it
2010-07-03T05:00:00.000Z	Agu10	codebrainz	that won't make it be enabled when I log-in, will it?
2010-07-03T05:00:00.000Z	codebrainz	Agu10	it does for me :)
2010-07-03T05:00:00.000Z	codebrainz	Agu10	i don't think i have said icon
2010-07-03T05:01:00.000Z	codebrainz	Agu10	unless compiz isn't working, it shouldn't fallback to metacity
2010-07-03T05:01:00.000Z	Agu10	codebrainz	it IS working. that's why I don't understand why it starts metacity instead
2010-07-03T05:02:00.000Z	codebrainz	Agu10	it's hacky, but you could add a start up program with the command 'compiz --replace' but you shouldn't need to do that
2010-07-03T05:02:00.000Z	Agu10	codebrainz	I'll try that
