2012-11-14T15:50:00.000Z	Evil_Eric		hi guys i got a question about 12.04 LTS 32bit and pae from what i read it automatic when it detects the architecture is this correct?
2012-11-14T15:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Evil_Eric	the kernel has PAE compiled into it so it is ued regardless
2012-11-14T15:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Evil_Eric	could get an i7 with intel and no nvidia, it'll run fine
2012-11-14T15:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Evil_Eric	yeah its the extra chip causing the issue, there is a hybrid guide for ubuntu but I've not used it first hand
2012-11-14T16:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Evil_Eric	your 32bit PAE kernel can access up to 64Gb RAM, but each process will see 3.2Gb RAM max
2012-11-14T16:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Evil_Eric	yes, same with skype :(
2012-11-14T16:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Evil_Eric	depends on the app you are using in Wine really
2012-11-14T16:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Evil_Eric	Postal2 runs well
2012-11-14T16:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Evil_Eric	yes, #ubuntu on irc.freenode.net
2012-11-14T16:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Evil_Eric	how do you mean 'media'? It's so ambiguous it's nearly meaningless
2012-11-14T16:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Evil_Eric	they are equal in that way
2012-11-19T02:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Evil_Eric	not bad really, you?
2012-11-19T02:04:00.000Z	Evil_Eric	ActionParsnip	just relaxing and slowly moving back into ubuntu 12.04
2012-11-19T02:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Evil_Eric	rocking Raring here ;)
2012-11-19T02:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Evil_Eric	me?
2012-11-23T02:02:00.000Z	Evil_Eric	ActionParsnip	you just beat me to that
2012-11-24T22:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Evil_Eric	ask here, the channel will reply
2012-11-25T07:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Evil_Eric	yes, the Ubuntu flavouruses it
2012-11-25T07:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Evil_Eric	also, the ones made using GTK uses the new GTK3
