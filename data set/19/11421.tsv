2006-01-24T17:07:00.000Z	kristie		how can i get my usb ports to work?
2006-01-24T17:07:00.000Z	kristie		sorry am newbie
2006-01-24T17:09:00.000Z	soundray	kristie	what USB ports? Motherboard? Laptop? Hub?
2006-01-24T17:10:00.000Z	kristie	soundray	it is a laptop
2006-01-24T17:11:00.000Z	soundray	kristie	what USB devices do you have for testing?
2006-01-24T17:12:00.000Z	kristie	soundray	i am trying to install my pda
2006-01-24T17:13:00.000Z	soundray	kristie	that is definitely not a great starting point for a newbie...
2006-01-24T17:14:00.000Z	soundray	kristie	you were saying your ports don't work. How did you work that out?
2006-01-24T17:14:00.000Z	kristie	soundray	i dunno *shrugs*
2006-01-24T17:15:00.000Z	soundray	kristie	okay, with talisein's tests and in the absence of other USB devices, we should conclude that your ports *probably* are fine.
2006-01-24T17:15:00.000Z	soundray	kristie	what's your PDA make and model?
2006-01-24T17:15:00.000Z	kristie	soundray	It is a Royal ezVue 5
2006-01-24T17:18:00.000Z	soundray	kristie	that device is neither Windows Mobile nor Palm compatible. Unless the manufacturer promises active Linux support, I think you can safely forget it. :(
2006-01-24T17:18:00.000Z	kristie	soundray	so the issue is moot?
2006-01-24T17:18:00.000Z	soundray	kristie	I mean, there is a slim chance that you might get it to work as a USB storage device.
2006-01-24T17:19:00.000Z	soundray	kristie	does it run on a Psion OS?
2006-01-24T17:21:00.000Z	soundray	kristie	you'd still need a Linux driver for communicating with the device. Unless you can reverse-engineer the Windows driver and write one, it will be hard to come by.
2006-01-24T17:21:00.000Z	soundray	kristie	buying a Palm will be much less painful...
2006-01-24T17:21:00.000Z	kristie	soundray	i agree..I will give this to the kids to play with LOL
