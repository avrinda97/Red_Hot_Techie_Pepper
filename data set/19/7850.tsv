2008-05-30T10:54:00.000Z	arrrghhh		well yea
2008-05-30T10:55:00.000Z	skillet	arrrghhh	what did you do before your reboot?
2008-05-30T10:56:00.000Z	arrrghhh	skillet	dpkg-reconfigure -pcritical xserver-xorg.  then reboot.  nothin else.
2008-05-30T10:56:00.000Z	skillet	arrrghhh	nothing network related?
2008-05-30T10:56:00.000Z	arrrghhh	skillet	nope.  i'm wondering if it's running fsck or something...
2008-05-30T10:57:00.000Z	skillet	arrrghhh	fsck is run on unmounted filesystems so no its not
2008-05-30T10:57:00.000Z	arrrghhh	skillet	well i don't know what's goin on now... i don't have any access any more.  i rebooted it several times from ssh and it worked...
2008-05-30T10:59:00.000Z	skillet	arrrghhh	maybe wait a bit and it will come back up
2008-05-30T10:59:00.000Z	arrrghhh	skillet	yea... i keep tryin it but nothin.  i think i'm just gonna have to wait till tomorrow.
2008-05-30T11:01:00.000Z	skillet	arrrghhh	dunno... ive had that happen to me before.
2008-05-30T11:01:00.000Z	arrrghhh	skillet	where the screen just stops working and X dies and kdm (or gdm...) takes up all your cpu?
2008-05-30T11:02:00.000Z	skillet	arrrghhh	on a friends box i had that happen
2008-05-30T11:02:00.000Z	arrrghhh	skillet	why?  my gf said she left the room, came back and it was dead... i don't get it.
2008-05-30T11:03:00.000Z	skillet	arrrghhh	i dont know either. it was a friends box that i was working on remotely. i just thought it was something that he had done
2008-05-30T11:03:00.000Z	skillet	arrrghhh	he had a flaky video card... ati
2008-05-30T11:04:00.000Z	arrrghhh	skillet	yes it probably is... but i don't get why even after reboot it's dead.  i have an nvidia card.  this system has always been real stable (until i change things) which i haven't.  i haven't been home in 2 weeks.
2008-05-30T11:04:00.000Z	skillet	arrrghhh	can you ping the box at all?
2008-05-30T11:05:00.000Z	arrrghhh	skillet	my router rejects ICMP ping requests.
2008-05-30T11:05:00.000Z	arrrghhh	skillet	but before my web server worked and ssh worked just fine.  torrentflux worked, but no X
