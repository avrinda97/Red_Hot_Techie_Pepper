2011-05-12T20:38:00.000Z	Almehdi	rcconf	Did you do "sudo umount /dev/sdaX" or how did you do it?
2011-05-12T20:39:00.000Z	rcconf	Almehdi	maybe I ejected that time..
2011-05-12T20:39:00.000Z	Almehdi	rcconf	well if it is working now?
2011-05-12T20:39:00.000Z	rcconf	Almehdi	I just want to know which is the command that nautilus uses when I click "safely remove driver" so I could do it from terminal!
