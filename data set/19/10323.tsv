2008-12-22T20:41:00.000Z	Arrick		isnt there a universal way to put that on ALL channels abchirk?
2008-12-22T20:42:00.000Z	hwilde	Arrick	Settings->  Advanced ->  if you have the formats you can essentially disable the messages.
2008-12-22T20:43:00.000Z	hwilde	Arrick	^hack the formats I meants to say
2008-12-23T19:28:00.000Z	hwilde	Arrick	just drag the right bar over a bit there should be a UserList
2008-12-23T19:29:00.000Z	hwilde	Arrick	otherwise,  Settings- > Preferences -> UserList ->  Show on Upper Right
2008-12-23T19:35:00.000Z	hwilde	Arrick	pretend like the user list is there but minimized and drag it open
2008-12-23T19:37:00.000Z	hwilde	Arrick	Settings-> Preferences -> User List -> Show on Right
2008-12-23T19:37:00.000Z	hwilde	Arrick	Go to Help About what version?
2008-12-23T19:38:00.000Z	hwilde	Arrick	you are not using the right version.
2008-12-23T19:38:00.000Z	hwilde	Arrick	Go to Help About what version?
2008-12-23T19:38:00.000Z	Arrick	hwilde	i installed it using the ubuntu synaptic package manager

2008-12-23T19:38:00.000Z	Arrick	hwilde	^
2008-12-23T19:39:00.000Z	hwilde	Arrick	it should say xchat 2.8.4 atleast.
2008-12-23T19:39:00.000Z	Arrick	hwilde	then it must be something I have to dl from another source seperatly.
2008-12-23T19:39:00.000Z	hwilde	Arrick	exit that program, go to Applications, Internet,  XChat IRC
2008-12-23T19:40:00.000Z	hwilde	Arrick	open a terminal type  "which xchat"
