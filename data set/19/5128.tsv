2010-06-09T00:06:00.000Z	Xetrov`	Slart	new install, i have run apt-get update
2010-06-09T00:07:00.000Z	Slart	Xetrov`	what does "apt-cache search essential" return?
2010-06-09T00:07:00.000Z	Xetrov`		whoa, tons
2010-06-09T00:08:00.000Z	Slart	Xetrov`	and you're not using capital letters anywhere..  sudo apt-get install Build-Essential  wont work, as far as I know
2010-06-09T00:08:00.000Z	Xetrov`		ok i greped build, comes back with build-essential
2010-06-09T00:08:00.000Z	Xetrov`		used all lower
2010-06-09T00:09:00.000Z	Slart	Xetrov`	can you pastebin the output of "sudo apt-get update; apt-cache search build-essential; sudo apt-get install build-essential" ?
2010-06-09T00:09:00.000Z	Xetrov`		ok i think i got it
2010-06-09T00:09:00.000Z	Xetrov`		apt-get install drbd8-utils drbd8-module-source \
2010-06-09T00:10:00.000Z	Xetrov`		had a space after the \ and before build-essential
2010-06-09T00:10:00.000Z	Xetrov`		whats the \ do?
2010-06-09T00:10:00.000Z	Slart	Xetrov`	lets you do a new line without it affecting the command
2010-06-09T00:11:00.000Z	Xetrov`		ok so really it wasnt needed
2010-06-09T00:11:00.000Z	Xetrov`		i could have just skipped it
2010-06-09T00:11:00.000Z	Slart	Xetrov`	nope
2010-06-09T00:11:00.000Z	Xetrov`		ok thanks
