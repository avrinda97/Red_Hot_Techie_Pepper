2009-06-26T15:18:00.000Z	domas		of course, 'const' will make it clear, etc, but still...
2009-06-26T15:19:00.000Z	domas		stupendoussteve: yeah yeah :) I'd like to see Ulrich Drepper triage such bug :)
2009-06-26T15:19:00.000Z	domas		stupendoussteve: "what? you can't figure out that s2 means...!!!"
2009-06-26T15:19:00.000Z	domas		that reminds me of people who name variables 'c','cc','ccc','c1','c2','c3' all in same function
2009-06-26T15:20:00.000Z	domas		I just wrote awesome program
2009-06-26T15:20:00.000Z	domas		http://p.defau.lt/?fugRsPiIge0gB10OrJtDpw - it clears OS cache for specific directory
2009-06-26T15:20:00.000Z	domas		why does ubuntu by default not have _GNU_SOURCE standard?
2009-06-26T15:20:00.000Z	domas		thats ubuntu support question :)
2009-06-26T15:21:00.000Z	domas		abysslinuxtag: you can join Ulrich now!
2009-06-26T15:21:00.000Z	alcohol	domas	heh, you here!
2009-06-26T15:52:00.000Z	domas	alcohol	/etc/hosts is not used as DNS source
2009-06-26T15:52:00.000Z	domas	alcohol	those two name resolution systems are separate
2009-06-26T15:52:00.000Z	alcohol	domas	then why does it work perfectly fine when I'm booted into xp on this machine?
2009-06-26T15:53:00.000Z	alcohol	domas	I use the same dns server (192.168.1.2) from winxp and ubuntu.
2009-06-26T15:53:00.000Z	alcohol	domas	all the domains ending in .local work fine when I'm in xp. can't resolve them when I'm in ubuntu :<
2009-06-26T15:54:00.000Z	alcohol	domas	so it's conflicting with something?
2009-06-26T15:54:00.000Z	alcohol	domas	the .local domains are just apache hosted vhosts.
2009-06-26T15:54:00.000Z	alcohol	domas	also hosted on 192.168.1.2
