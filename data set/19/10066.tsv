2006-08-08T05:52:00.000Z	ian_	scrappy_	Ok, I'm back.  But my card still isn't installed... Not sure where I went wrong.
2006-08-08T05:53:00.000Z	scrappy_	ian_	the problem is you tried to setup nvidia drivers and now cant get into the gui right?
2006-08-08T05:54:00.000Z	ian_	scrappy_	Actually, I got Xserver back online using "sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg".  Now xserver is working but I still don't have my nvidia card enables...
2006-08-08T05:55:00.000Z	ian_	scrappy_	*enabled
2006-08-08T05:55:00.000Z	scrappy_	ian_	youre using a i686 or 386 kernel right?
2006-08-08T05:55:00.000Z	ian_	scrappy_	Yep.  And it's an older nvidia, so it should be the legacy package...
2006-08-08T05:56:00.000Z	ian_	scrappy_	I;m working from the man at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia
2006-08-08T05:57:00.000Z	ian_	scrappy_	First step being "sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx-legacy"  which I've done and just rechecked...
2006-08-08T05:58:00.000Z	scrappy_	ian_	ok sudo apt-get install linux-restricted-modules-`uname -r` just copy that and paste into a terminal
2006-08-08T05:58:00.000Z	ian_	scrappy_	Also installed nvidia-glx-dev because I wasn't sure if it was the same as 3d grapicks acceleration (reasonably certina it's not, but..)
2006-08-08T05:59:00.000Z	ian_	scrappy_	Ok, wait uninstalled the dev package, not what I needed.
2006-08-08T06:00:00.000Z	scrappy_	ian_	you can remove the dev package or leave it however you like
2006-08-08T06:00:00.000Z	ian_	scrappy_	Ok, input what you said to... No errors returned..
2006-08-08T06:01:00.000Z	scrappy_	ian_	lets try sudo nvidia-glx-config enable again and then alt-ctrl-backspace
2006-08-08T06:01:00.000Z	scrappy_	ian_	what were looking for is that pretty nvidia logo when it starts back up
2006-08-08T06:02:00.000Z	ian_	scrappy_	Yeah, I did this before I reinstalled last night.  Worked fine. got the logo, all was well.  About to restart Xserver, brb.
2006-08-08T06:03:00.000Z	ian_	scrappy_	Worked!
2006-08-08T06:04:00.000Z	scrappy_	ian_	congrats :)
2006-08-08T06:04:00.000Z	ian_	scrappy_	Thank you for the help!  :D
