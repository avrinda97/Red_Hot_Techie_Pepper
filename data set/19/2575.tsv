2010-02-26T20:29:00.000Z	DuCkNeT		alright guys got a good one here.. need to recover a file without extensions....
2010-02-26T20:30:00.000Z	sbts	DuCkNeT	specifically what do you need to do, did you accidentaly delete the file? also what filesystem is it on?
2010-02-26T20:31:00.000Z	DuCkNeT	sbts	ext4 file system i've move the file and now there is nothing in it
2010-02-26T20:32:00.000Z	sbts	DuCkNeT	what command did you use to move the file?
2010-02-26T20:35:00.000Z	sbts	DuCkNeT	ouch, that may make things more difficult, I am assuming, as you are using ext4, that the system is 9.10 (karmic)
2010-02-26T20:35:00.000Z	DuCkNeT	sbts	extact...
2010-02-26T20:36:00.000Z	sbts	DuCkNeT	do you have a partial copy of the text, or even and EXACT copy of one or more lines in the text?
2010-02-26T20:39:00.000Z	DuCkNeT	sbts	i know what could have been in the text
2010-02-26T20:43:00.000Z	DuCkNeT	sbts	i know what could have been in the text ....
2010-02-26T20:53:00.000Z	sbts	DuCkNeT	ok the best thing to do here would be shutdown the machine and reboot in from a live cd, then come back here for further help, basically you will need to do somthing like sudo grep -i -a -U -Bx -Ay 'known text from file' /dev/sda1 | tee /tmp/recovered.txt      this assumes that the drive is /dev/sda and the partition the file is on is partition 1. also you will need to change the -Bx to -B10 (for example) and -Ay to -A10 (for example).
2010-02-26T20:53:00.000Z	DuCkNeT	sbts	ok so i boot with karmic cd live and then come back here and you explain me this ?
2010-02-26T20:56:00.000Z	sbts	DuCkNeT	Yes I can try, unfortunately the grep (which is a search) can take a very long time for something like this.
2010-02-26T20:56:00.000Z	DuCkNeT	sbts	has to be from live cd ?
2010-02-26T20:58:00.000Z	sbts	DuCkNeT	basically that is the best way, the longer you are running the machine with the harddrive mounted, the more chance you have of permanently obliterating the data you want to retrieve
2010-02-26T22:22:00.000Z	DuCkNeT	sbts	still there ?
2010-02-26T22:30:00.000Z	sbts	DuCkNeT	give me a couple of minutes
2010-02-26T22:33:00.000Z	DuCkNeT	sbts	ok
2010-02-26T22:39:00.000Z	sbts	DuCkNeT	finding that for you now
2010-02-26T22:41:00.000Z	sbts	DuCkNeT	I have just private messaged you
