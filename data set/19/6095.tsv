2008-03-14T06:19:00.000Z	cryonix		strong what do mean by a valid shell?
2008-03-14T06:20:00.000Z	cryonix		i see
2008-03-14T06:20:00.000Z	cryonix		it says /bin/bash
2008-03-14T06:21:00.000Z	cryonix		ok let me try
2008-03-14T06:21:00.000Z	cryonix		Shell: bin/bash
2008-03-14T06:22:00.000Z	Strongbow[TX]	cryonix	"bin/bash" or "/bin/bash"?
2008-03-14T06:22:00.000Z	Strongbow[TX]	cryonix	OK, unless you've done somethign weird, the user has a valid shell.
2008-03-14T06:24:00.000Z	Strongbow[TX]	cryonix	next thing to check is the home directory. Does it exist? Look for "Directory:" in the output above and see if you can do "cd directory" (replacing directory with what it says in the finger output)
2008-03-14T06:26:00.000Z	Strongbow[TX]	cryonix	have you looked at your logs to see what it says? Have a look at /var/log/messages and /var/log/secure
2008-03-14T06:28:00.000Z	Strongbow[TX]	cryonix	only slightly. The bigger danger is using weak passwords.
2008-03-14T06:31:00.000Z	Strongbow[TX]	cryonix	did you check the home directory for the user exists?
2008-03-14T06:32:00.000Z	cryonix	Strongbow[TX]	i can see the user folder there in /home/
2008-03-14T06:32:00.000Z	Strongbow[TX]	cryonix	ok, next, did you look at /var/log/messages and /var/log/secure?
2008-03-14T06:35:00.000Z	Strongbow[TX]	cryonix	that was me actually. Anyway, look for anything about that user. More likely the message you want is going to be in /var/log/secure though.
2008-03-14T06:36:00.000Z	cryonix	Strongbow[TX]	i dont have /var/log/secure but i've got /var/logs/messages
2008-03-14T06:43:00.000Z	Strongbow[TX]	cryonix	"su" will ask for the root password. "sudo" asks for your password.
2008-03-14T06:44:00.000Z	Strongbow[TX]	cryonix	sudo might not even ask. I think it doesn't on ubuntu.
2008-03-14T06:44:00.000Z	Strongbow[TX]	cryonix	what rsk said.
2008-03-14T07:24:00.000Z	Strongbow[TX]	cryonix	got ssh working?
