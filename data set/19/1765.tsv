2010-12-18T07:25:00.000Z	jmad980		I wouldn't ;)
2010-12-18T07:27:00.000Z	KM0201	jmad980	yeah, it seems very problematic right now
2010-12-18T07:27:00.000Z	jmad980		ath9k?
2010-12-18T07:28:00.000Z	KM0201	jmad980	ath9k is to set up some of the newer atheros wireless devices
2010-12-18T07:28:00.000Z	jmad980	KM0201	yeah, I've been using it for a while, tho on some of the older kernels I had problems with it
2010-12-18T07:29:00.000Z	KM0201	jmad980	does it work now?.. which ath9 device do you have?
2010-12-18T07:29:00.000Z	jmad980		nowadays I've been connected to IRC for over a week without it dieing on me
2010-12-18T07:29:00.000Z	jmad980		pretty decent on the newer kernels
2010-12-18T07:29:00.000Z	jmad980		hmm
2010-12-18T07:29:00.000Z	KM0201		ar928x by chance?
2010-12-18T07:29:00.000Z	jmad980		07:00.0 Network controller: Atheros Communications Inc. AR928X Wireless Network Adapter (PCI-Express) (rev 01)
2010-12-18T07:29:00.000Z	jmad980		indeed
2010-12-18T07:29:00.000Z	KM0201		how'd you get it working
2010-12-18T07:30:00.000Z	jmad980		didn't really do anything :p
2010-12-18T07:30:00.000Z	KM0201		hmm
2010-12-18T07:30:00.000Z	KM0201		you running 10.10?.. 32 or 64bit
2010-12-18T07:30:00.000Z	jmad980		was running 10.10 ok 32bit, but I haven't run ubuntu in a while :)
2010-12-18T07:31:00.000Z	KM0201	jmad980	oh i thought you were still running ubuntu... what are you running?
2010-12-18T07:31:00.000Z	jmad980	KM0201	arch which is why I have a newer kernel, might be able to try a newer one in ubuntu but it might not be worth the effort
