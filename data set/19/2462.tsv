2010-06-26T18:27:00.000Z	magicianlord		eww
2010-06-26T18:28:00.000Z	magicianlord		you just compile the driver. its not hard
2010-06-26T18:28:00.000Z	magicianlord		you have ot have kernel headers installed and base-devel tools
2010-06-26T18:28:00.000Z	magicianlord		then you run some commands to create adriver and then insert it to boot at startup
2010-06-26T18:30:00.000Z	magicianlord		what's better: epiphany-webkit or firefox
2010-06-26T18:31:00.000Z	VCoolio	magicianlord	depends on what you need; epiphany is faster but less add-ons; recent webkit has more html5 support atm
2010-06-26T18:32:00.000Z	magicianlord	VCoolio	i like webkit for speed, but it still cannot log into https sites like wifi cafes. is this being fixed?
2010-06-26T18:33:00.000Z	magicianlord		is epiphany based on the same curent code as chromium?
2010-06-26T18:34:00.000Z	VCoolio	magicianlord	no idea, didn't know about the issue, mine works; chromium is something different
2010-06-26T18:36:00.000Z	magicianlord	VCoolio	is your epiphany webkit based?
2010-06-26T18:36:00.000Z	magicianlord		the only ones were gecko
2010-06-26T18:36:00.000Z	VCoolio	magicianlord	I tried an https with midori
2010-06-26T18:41:00.000Z	magicianlord		hmm
2010-06-26T18:41:00.000Z	magicianlord		chromium isnt launching
2010-06-26T18:41:00.000Z	magicianlord		wonder wh
2010-06-26T18:42:00.000Z	VCoolio	magicianlord	epiphany works for me too, epiphany 2.30.2 with webkit 1.2.1-1
2010-06-26T18:43:00.000Z	VCoolio	magicianlord	check terminal output for useful errors
2010-06-26T18:43:00.000Z	magicianlord	VCoolio	but is this from a cafe for example, or you just tried https. it needs to be a site that requires logon to get net access in the first place
2010-06-26T18:43:00.000Z	VCoolio	magicianlord	I just tried a site with https and login, not for net access
