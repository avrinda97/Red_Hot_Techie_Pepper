2009-12-22T09:10:00.000Z	ibkanat		it fails on inserting my nvidia and vbox modules

2009-12-22T09:12:00.000Z	ibkanat		vbox performance on guest is terrible I improved it with a build but read that upgrade fixes

2009-12-22T09:18:00.000Z	mMezquitale	ibkanat	virtual box works just fine on my machine, try configuring the amount of memory and video ram
2009-12-22T09:19:00.000Z	mMezquitale	ibkanat	true, you still have to configure those settings into virtualbox, make sure your BIOS is using the most ram for video as you can
2009-12-22T09:21:00.000Z	mMezquitale	ibkanat	try installing ubuntu studio using and use a real time kernel
2009-12-22T09:22:00.000Z	ibkanat	mMezquitale	had big problems with it... dont know why thats what I tried 1st
2009-12-22T09:23:00.000Z	mMezquitale	ibkanat	you have problems with ubuntu studio real time kernel?
2009-12-22T09:25:00.000Z	mMezquitale	ibkanat	i had the same problem, I solved it by going to ubuntu studio controls and made sure ubuntu studio didnt lock memory, then went to virtual box and gave around 50% of memory to virtual box, set video memory to 128MB, audio sounds awesome with XP as guest OS
2009-12-22T09:26:00.000Z	ibkanat	mMezquitale	hmm I got the stutter to stop but not with usb just need a little fast to run magic jack on it
2009-12-22T09:27:00.000Z	mMezquitale	ibkanat	I also set # of processors to 2 on virtualbox, it works great, Im using 64 bit AMD
2009-12-22T09:28:00.000Z	ibkanat	mMezquitale	mine runs best on one thats why I know there is a problem
2009-12-22T09:32:00.000Z	mMezquitale	ibkanat	must be an issue with your CPU then, you should follow the bug report and check "/var/messages" for anything interesting
