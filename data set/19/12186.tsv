2005-10-11T14:03:00.000Z	squid0		I've installed java on my system, but how do I make sure that PATH includes the path to java always?
2005-10-11T14:03:00.000Z	nalioth	squid0	how did you install it?
2005-10-11T14:04:00.000Z	squid0	nalioth	i used the jdk install from the Sun java site
2005-10-11T14:04:00.000Z	nalioth	squid0	the wiki should mention how to set the $PATH for it
2005-10-11T14:05:00.000Z	squid0	nalioth	i'll check, but I've seen a few places on the web like 'export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/java/bin:.'
2005-10-11T14:05:00.000Z	nalioth	squid0	that will work in your .bashrc
2005-10-11T14:05:00.000Z	squid0	nalioth	ah. where is that?
2005-10-11T14:06:00.000Z	nalioth	squid0	/home/squid0/.bashrc
2005-10-11T14:10:00.000Z	squid0	nalioth	kbrooks: works great.
2005-10-13T12:50:00.000Z	nalioth	squid0	qtparted
2005-10-13T12:51:00.000Z	squid0	nalioth	thanks, I tried it and it doesn't work properly. says an error occurs when I commit changes after telling it to partition an ntfs partition...
2005-10-13T12:51:00.000Z	nalioth	squid0	then i dont know what to advise
2005-10-13T12:52:00.000Z	nalioth	squid0	run chkdsk in windows on the partition
2005-10-13T12:52:00.000Z	squid0	nalioth	ok. thanks anyway :)
2005-10-13T12:52:00.000Z	squid0	nalioth	what is that?
2005-10-13T12:52:00.000Z	nalioth	squid0	in Windows, there is a utility to fix your windows file system. it's called chkdsk
2005-10-13T12:53:00.000Z	squid0	nalioth	ok. does it enable you to resize a partition?
2005-10-13T12:53:00.000Z	nalioth	squid0	if your partition is screwed, qtparted won't work on it
2005-10-13T12:54:00.000Z	squid0	nalioth	oh, i see. no, i don't think the problem is the partition. i think it's qtparted. the partition is fine
