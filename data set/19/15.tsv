2004-10-11T13:59:00.000Z	jdub		wow
2004-10-11T14:00:00.000Z	joem	jdub	pretty sweet
2004-10-11T14:04:00.000Z	joem	jdub	is there any easy way for my install to mimic the way the live cd goes through hardware detection/module loading stuff
2004-10-11T14:04:00.000Z	jdub	joem	do they do things differently? the installer should be a bit better
2004-10-11T14:05:00.000Z	joem	jdub	could be a conflict with the sata drivers, but I can't use ide hardware with the install(or from the install cd)
2004-10-11T14:06:00.000Z	joem	jdub	yea..have talked with most people about it, can't seem to track it down all the way
2004-10-19T12:02:00.000Z	jdub	joem	gksudo swallows the tty
2004-10-20T05:22:00.000Z	joem	jdub	what reasons are there behind not using ooo-ximian?
2004-10-20T05:22:00.000Z	jdub	joem	ooo-ximian is the branch that novell, red hat and debian work on -> we do have it :-)
2004-10-21T14:12:00.000Z	joem	jdub	know how to go about migrating evolution calendar data from 1.4 to 2.0
2004-10-21T14:13:00.000Z	jdub	joem	if you have an ~/evolution directory, it should automigrate
2004-10-21T14:15:00.000Z	jdub	joem	evo1.4 calendar data is just an ics file
2004-10-27T11:39:00.000Z	jdub	joem	there are objective reasons for that.
2004-10-27T11:39:00.000Z	joem	jdub	I agree, Im just saying that because you don't like something the hig does, doesn't really make either of you wrong
2004-11-05T06:12:00.000Z	joem	jdub	are there any signature series cds with fancy autographs?
2004-11-05T06:13:00.000Z	jdub	joem	dude, that's an awesome idea.
2004-11-05T06:14:00.000Z	joem	jdub	I bet there are somepeople out there that would throw down some serious dollar for a jdub autograph
