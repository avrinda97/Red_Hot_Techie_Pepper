2012-04-21T21:02:00.000Z	escott	AngrySpam	you would know if you enabled a ppa
2012-04-21T21:02:00.000Z	AngrySpam	escott	well seeming how i know NOTHING about this, i dont know what the fudge that is.
2012-04-21T21:02:00.000Z	escott	AngrySpam	i would try opening a terminal and typing "sudo apt-get install wine"
