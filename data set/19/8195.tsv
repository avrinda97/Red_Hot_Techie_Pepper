2007-04-25T05:37:00.000Z	chalzedony		i thought my computer had CRASHED.. but my nick is still online so it's working :)
2007-04-25T05:38:00.000Z	Jordan_U	chalzedony	Nicks tend to take a while to time out so it may still be crashed :(
2007-04-25T05:39:00.000Z	chalzedony	Jordan_U	it locked up open office about two hours ago, what I have now is a black screen with a moving mouse arrow.
2007-04-25T05:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U	chalzedony	Can you get to a tty?
2007-04-25T05:40:00.000Z	chalzedony	Jordan_U	tty?
2007-04-25T05:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U	chalzedony	ctrl+alt+F1 to get to a terminal ( ctrl+alt+F7 to return to GUI )
2007-04-25T05:44:00.000Z	chalzedony	Jordan_U	control alt f1 got me to a Starting up Ubuntu 6:10 startup, control alt f7 does nothing .. did f1 restart it??
2007-04-25T05:47:00.000Z	chalzedony	Jordan_U	it says it timed out.. *sigh*
2007-04-25T05:50:00.000Z	Jordan_U	chalzedony	Is the last thing it says "login:" ?
2007-04-25T05:50:00.000Z	chalzedony	Jordan_U	yup
2007-04-25T05:52:00.000Z	Jordan_U	chalzedony	Enter your username and hit return, it will then ask you for your password
2007-04-25T05:52:00.000Z	chalzedony	Jordan_U	ok and then?
2007-04-25T05:53:00.000Z	chalzedony	Jordan_U	ok now a propmt .. but i'm still online with chalcedony from that box
2007-04-25T05:53:00.000Z	Jordan_U	chalzedony	What program do you think is crashed? You can run "top" to see what processes are using the most CPU and "killall <program name> to quit a program
2007-04-25T05:54:00.000Z	chalzedony	Jordan_U	firefox :)
2007-04-25T05:57:00.000Z	chalzedony	Jordan_U	is there something to tell if Open Office is still running? i'm fairly sure it did something naughty.
2007-04-25T05:58:00.000Z	Jordan_U	chalzedony	ps aux | grep oo
2007-04-25T05:59:00.000Z	chalzedony	Jordan_U	robbie's command got me two lines.. yours got me a whole page of repreats!
