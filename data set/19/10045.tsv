2006-09-16T08:57:00.000Z	lastnode	adminx	the howto is rather confusing, it doesnt say if my 200m will work. it's kind of a low end card, on a laptop too, and 128 shared memory. :\
2006-09-16T09:00:00.000Z	lastnode	adminx	this is a lowend
2006-09-16T09:01:00.000Z	lastnode	adminx	ok thanks, going for it
2006-09-16T09:04:00.000Z	lastnode	adminx	the repo adds fine, but the last package in the howto is not found - gnome-compiz-manager
2006-09-16T09:44:00.000Z	lastnode	adminx	uninstall?
2006-09-16T09:22:00.000Z	lastnode	adminx	hi, im running a radeon 200m express, and i installed aiglx following the ubuntu tutorial. gdm loads up gnome fine, but when i run compiz-manager from the cli, gdm restarts. any idea how i can troubleshoot this?
2006-09-16T09:37:00.000Z	lastnode	adminx	any idea why it loads gnome w/o a problem and just dies when i run compiz-manager though?

2006-09-16T09:38:00.000Z	lastnode	adminx	except i didnt apt-get dist-upgrade because it was 180mb (this is a fresh install of dapper). so im doing that now. could that be the prob?
2006-09-16T09:39:00.000Z	lastnode	adminx	wondering if to follow gandalf - http://gandalfn.wordpress.com/howto-compiz-aiglx-on-dapper/
2006-09-16T09:40:00.000Z	lastnode	adminx	hmm ill brb
2006-09-16T09:42:00.000Z	lastnode	adminx	when i run compiz-manager from the cli, it loads up a white screen, and then hangs. there is some small cli output before it. do i need to set a startup command
2006-09-16T09:45:00.000Z	adminx	lastnode	email me at ceo at administratorx dot net, later tonight. Will tell you how it goes on my thinkpad with ati card.
2006-09-16T09:48:00.000Z	lastnode	adminx	works! thanks :-) cant figure out how to use it now, though
2006-09-16T09:48:00.000Z	lastnode	adminx	do i need to load something? because im using the shortcut keys and i cant see no cube :P
2006-09-16T09:51:00.000Z	lastnode	adminx	i spoke to soon. as soon as i selected compiz over metacity it died
