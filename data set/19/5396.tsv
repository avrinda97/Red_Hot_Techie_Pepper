2011-01-26T22:04:00.000Z	Quatroking		Is it possible to install a normal installation of Ubuntu on a USB stick and have it run anywhere?
2011-01-26T22:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_	Quatroking	 yes. there can be some issues.. but it can work
2011-01-26T22:04:00.000Z	Quatroking		I've found several guides on how to do it but they only create live-usb's
2011-01-26T22:05:00.000Z	Quatroking		yeah, Dr_Willis_, thats a live, isn't it
2011-01-26T22:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_	Quatroking	 a full install to a flash drive is not a live cd.. the 2 differ. :)
2011-01-26T22:05:00.000Z	Quatroking		what I'm looking for is complete install as if it were on my normal HDD
2011-01-26T22:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_	Quatroking	 thats doable..
2011-01-26T22:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_	Quatroking	 watch out for special hardware drivers that can conflict on differnt machines
2011-01-26T22:06:00.000Z	Quatroking	Dr_Willis_	do you know of any guides for that?
2011-01-26T22:07:00.000Z	Quatroking		I'd make a LiveUSB but AFAIK they don't have swap
2011-01-26T22:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_	Quatroking	 just do a normal install.. tell it to go to the usb hd... be sure grub is installed to the proper device at the end.
2011-01-26T22:10:00.000Z	Quatroking		so a normal install on the USB stick should do fine as long as I install grub along with it, on the stick
2011-01-26T22:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_	Quatroking	 this is not a persistant 'live' usb - its a normal 'full' install.   for differnt hardware machines. You may want to go the live/persistant route.
2011-01-26T22:10:00.000Z	Quatroking		I see
2011-01-26T22:11:00.000Z	Quatroking		these persistant live usb's, can I install extra packages on them?
2011-01-26T22:11:00.000Z	Quatroking		additional software and stuff like that?
2011-01-26T22:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_	Quatroking	 just dont try to do a full 'upgrade/update' on a persistant-live setup.. it can goof things up ive found.
