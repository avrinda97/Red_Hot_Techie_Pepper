2011-10-13T23:01:00.000Z	GriGi		hi, i got lil question: How to change icons in 11.10? I know how to do it in 11.04 but now i have lost my icons and i don't know how to change icons theme :/
2011-10-13T23:01:00.000Z	GriGi		it's not in the same place where i can change wallaper as it was in 11.04
2011-10-13T23:01:00.000Z	sebsebseb	GriGi	I don't think you can just go and change the icons in 11.10
2011-10-13T23:01:00.000Z	sebsebseb	GriGi	yep
2011-10-13T23:01:00.000Z	sebsebseb	GriGi	Ubuntu 11.10 is using GNome 3.2 that's why, Unity by default, Gnome Shell in repos, and a fall back mode
2011-10-13T23:01:00.000Z	sebsebseb		!gnome2 | GriGi
2011-10-13T23:02:00.000Z	GriGi		Awww, so im sad now :(
2011-10-13T23:02:00.000Z	GriGi		Okay, thanks for info guys
2011-10-13T23:02:00.000Z	sebsebseb	GriGi	I assume you
2011-10-13T23:02:00.000Z	sebsebseb	GriGi	I assume you changed the icons the Gnome 2 way and such, but with Gnome 3 things are diffenret
2011-10-13T23:03:00.000Z	sebsebseb	GriGi	as for the background changeer program persoanlly from what I seen I prefer the old Gnome 2 one :)
2011-10-13T23:03:00.000Z	GriGi	sebsebseb	so there's some program or something that can let me change the icons?
2011-10-13T23:04:00.000Z	sebsebseb	GriGi	 well maybe in there soem wehre
2011-10-13T23:04:00.000Z	GriGi	sebsebseb	okay, so i'll look for something like this or i will just start using standard icon set
2011-10-13T23:04:00.000Z	sebsebseb	GriGi	now your in Unity, but
2011-10-13T23:05:00.000Z	sebsebseb	GriGi	well that gnome tweak tool might work with Unity as well for exmaple, plus  Gnome has it's config settings like wehre your changing your background, look aorund probaby something for icons
2011-10-13T23:05:00.000Z	sebsebseb		!notunity > GriGi
2011-10-13T23:05:00.000Z	GriGi		!notunity
2011-10-13T23:06:00.000Z	sebsebseb	GriGi	or maybe not, since Gnome 3 themes are done diffenrelty as well hmm for Shell, hmm, ah well worth a look around anyway
