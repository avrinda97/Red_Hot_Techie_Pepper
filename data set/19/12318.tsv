2005-10-11T10:57:00.000Z	LaschW		I'm looking for the ipt_TTL (Target) kernel patch of iptables. (not ipt_ttl which is the match module). But I can't find the patch, neither on iptables.org nor on netfilter.org.
2005-10-11T10:58:00.000Z	crimsun	LaschW	um, it's in patch-o-matic
2005-10-11T11:00:00.000Z	LaschW	crimsun	Hhhm, no tarball for download? To be honest I'm no friend of patch-o-matic... ;_)
2005-10-11T11:03:00.000Z	LaschW	crimsun	It would be good if there would be ipt_TTL deb's for linux-image(s) offered by Ubuntu: I can't beleve that I'm the only one who has a fussy inet provider who don't alow more than one computer per Line...
2005-10-11T11:03:00.000Z	crimsun	LaschW	absolutely no go for Breezy. Perhaps Dapper.
2005-10-11T11:04:00.000Z	LaschW	crimsun	Even not for multiverse?
2005-10-11T11:04:00.000Z	crimsun	LaschW	not even for multiverse.
2005-10-11T11:06:00.000Z	LaschW	crimsun	Inofficial ones? *whisperingaprayer*
2005-10-11T11:06:00.000Z	crimsun	LaschW	unofficial what?
2005-10-11T11:07:00.000Z	LaschW	crimsun	Backports, inofficial repositories, (security fixes), ... ;-)
2005-10-11T11:08:00.000Z	crimsun	LaschW	at this stage nothing is going to be applied to the kernel sources unless it's non-invasive regression fixes. No new features are going in. Multiverse wouldn't be the proper place for it anyhow; it's only concerned with licensing issues.
2005-10-11T11:08:00.000Z	crimsun	LaschW	there is nothing preventing you from applying it yourself, though.
2005-10-11T11:08:00.000Z	LaschW	crimsun	OK, seems I have to have a closer look to patch-o-matic again...
2005-10-11T11:09:00.000Z	LaschW	crimsun	BTW. 'it's only concerned with licensing issues', licensing issues of this particular module or in general
2005-10-11T11:10:00.000Z	crimsun	LaschW	in general. For instance, if it were to be non-maintainable by the kernel crew, it'd be in universe.
2005-10-11T11:10:00.000Z	crimsun	LaschW	I presume the license is GPL...
2005-10-11T11:15:00.000Z	LaschW	crimsun	: Thank you very much for the hit to patch-o-matik. regards, Wolfgang
