2012-07-09T01:12:00.000Z	jagginess	HDScorpio	google 'gparted live cd' (and there's an iso and usb avail)
2012-07-09T01:13:00.000Z	jagginess	HDScorpio	pendrive isn't part of ubuntu's official docs i believe

2012-07-09T01:16:00.000Z	jagginess	HDScorpio	(not part of ubuntu), you need to have a fat32 formatted partition on the usb drive..
2012-07-09T01:17:00.000Z	jagginess	HDScorpio	you don't burn iso's to usb drives..
2012-07-09T01:18:00.000Z	jagginess	HDScorpio	you download the iso to C: , not to the <letter of usb>:
2012-07-09T01:18:00.000Z	jagginess	HDScorpio	then you run the usb-maker tool
2012-07-09T01:19:00.000Z	jagginess	HDScorpio	what was the letter drive of the usb?
2012-07-09T01:19:00.000Z	jagginess	HDScorpio	so re-format E: (the usb drive partition) .. and use that usb maker instead of unetbootin
2012-07-09T01:20:00.000Z	jagginess	HDScorpio	can you boot with the cd? (do you have a cd drive?)
2012-07-09T01:21:00.000Z	jagginess	HDScorpio	"burn" means to iso->cd.  The Usb MAker tools do not "burn", they "extract" stuff from the .iso and place those files on the usb.
2012-07-09T01:22:00.000Z	jagginess	HDScorpio	imgburn is free and very easy to "burn" to a "CD". -- If you have a cd drive.
2012-07-09T01:25:00.000Z	jagginess	HDScorpio	read.

2012-07-09T01:27:00.000Z	jagginess	HDScorpio	what did i tell you to google?
2012-07-09T01:28:00.000Z	jagginess	HDScorpio	http://sourceforge.net/projects/gparted/files/gparted-live-stable/ << you tried?
2012-07-09T01:29:00.000Z	jagginess	HDScorpio	try using firefox.. i see you're using chrome.
2012-07-09T01:31:00.000Z	jagginess	HDScorpio	when you use gparted. Resize your linux partition, and then move it towards the end. Then make a new partition at the "beginning" (ntfs). I stop here.
