2009-11-01T21:12:00.000Z	echo6		where can I find documentation on 9.10 gdm setup?
2009-11-01T21:13:00.000Z	sebsebseb	echo6	What do you want to do with GDM?
2009-11-01T21:14:00.000Z	sebsebseb	echo6	You can't theme the new GDM like the old one could be themed,  the new one icons and colours can be changed and that's it I think
2009-11-01T21:14:00.000Z	echo6	sebsebseb	grr, shame
2009-11-01T21:14:00.000Z	sebsebseb	echo6	indeed
2009-11-01T21:14:00.000Z	sebsebseb	echo6	kdm is nice though now days
2009-11-01T21:14:00.000Z	sebsebseb	echo6	nice blue bubble theme for the KDE 4 KDM
2009-11-01T21:15:00.000Z	echo6	sebsebseb	yeah means a whole load of other depenencies I could do without
2009-11-01T21:15:00.000Z	sebsebseb	echo6	plus  someone told me about another over a week ago now,  that is probably ok, that isn't in the repo  also
2009-11-01T21:16:00.000Z	echo6	sebsebseb	ok, thanks will bide my time until 9.10 starts to see more docs and other app support
2009-11-01T21:17:00.000Z	sebsebseb	echo6	bide your time? meaning?  you make it sound like you might put 9.04 on
2009-11-01T21:17:00.000Z	echo6	sebsebseb	I will stick with 9.04 yes, I have a neeb for a cd remaster with certain themes
2009-11-01T21:18:00.000Z	sebsebseb	echo6	uhmm  it's the log in screen Gnome Display Manager that can't be themed like before yes, but  Gnome itself can be themed like before still
2009-11-01T21:18:00.000Z	echo6	sebsebseb	Yes, I need to change gdm login screen as well as  gnome etc
2009-11-01T21:19:00.000Z	echo6	sebsebseb	I prefer fbsplash as well!, + fbcondecor
2009-11-01T21:19:00.000Z	echo6	sebsebseb	although looking forward to what kms + xsplash has to offer
2009-11-01T21:19:00.000Z	sebsebseb	echo6	I thought changing the  theme for  GDM  was for fun/eyecandy   with there not being a true proper reason to do it.   ,but yeah it's ashame no blubuntu gdm theme  for 9.10 GDM,   so nice in 9.04 and 8.10 and that
2009-11-01T21:20:00.000Z	sebsebseb	echo6	blubuntu being in the repo
2009-11-01T21:22:00.000Z	echo6	sebsebseb	eye candy is one thing, but I want somethin aking to a corporate image
