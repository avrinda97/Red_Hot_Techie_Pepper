2008-05-01T02:06:00.000Z	amidaniel	chris_420	Just had this issue :) What's your problem?
2008-05-01T02:07:00.000Z	chris_420		ami i am using mondo for back up.... created an iso in the /var/cache/mindi/ directory right?  so i copied this for better usage to my home folder... now i have many iso's of different sizes
2008-05-01T02:07:00.000Z	chris_420		 can i burn multiple iso's to the same dvd in the same session with growisofs?
2008-05-01T02:08:00.000Z	chris_420	amidaniel	or would i have to get a dif prog? preferably command line haha
2008-05-01T02:08:00.000Z	amidaniel	chris_420	Are you just trying to burn the iso to a cd?
2008-05-01T02:08:00.000Z	chris_420		i don't have a cd burner currently only dvd
2008-05-01T02:10:00.000Z	chris_420	amidaniel	mondoarchives states there could be an issue with burning directly to dvd which is why i chose this route
2008-05-01T02:10:00.000Z	amidaniel	chris_420	Well, you could use cdrecord at the command line or simply select the file in Nautilus, right-click on it, and select burn iso
2008-05-01T02:10:00.000Z	amidaniel	chris_420	I don't see why ..
2008-05-01T02:11:00.000Z	chris_420	amidaniel	well i was running it from like sudo mondoarchivbe -0 -i -v -d/home/chris
2008-05-01T02:12:00.000Z	chris_420		and it states if ran from sudo doesn't support dvd wirting or something to that effect
2008-05-01T02:12:00.000Z	chris_420		ill try the nautalus method
2008-05-01T02:12:00.000Z	chris_420		one sec
2008-05-01T02:14:00.000Z	chris_420		amidaniel.... tried it but it will only burn one ISO at a time and i don't know where which to burn
2008-05-01T02:15:00.000Z	amidaniel	chris_420	Why would you want to burn more than one iso at a time? O.o
2008-05-01T02:16:00.000Z	chris_420		amidanielit created one named mondorescue.iso  which was cached... the rest are name executionersbackup  and were created into the home folder as intentended
2008-05-01T02:16:00.000Z	chris_420	amidaniel	well because i don't know which is the right one to burn ... first tiime using mondoarchives
2008-05-01T02:17:00.000Z	amidaniel	chris_420	Ermkay .. well, you can only burn one image to a single dvd, unless you want to store the isos as *files* on the dvd ...
