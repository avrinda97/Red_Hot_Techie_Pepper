2009-03-10T17:09:00.000Z	rmrfslash		I'm waiting for my new laptop and deciding to go w/ kubuntu or ubuntu
2009-03-10T17:09:00.000Z	rmrfslash		I used to use Ubuntu, now I'm using Kubuntu, but I'm wondering if things are more polished on Ubuntu and trickle down to Kubuntu
2009-03-10T17:10:00.000Z	rmrfslash		I do find that Kubuntu is buggy as hell at times
2009-03-10T17:10:00.000Z	rmrfslash		or more so, kde 4.2
2009-03-10T17:10:00.000Z	rmrfslash		bugs?
2009-03-10T17:11:00.000Z	rmrfslash		Why do people even deal w/ KDE? From my experience, it's never been "stable"
2009-03-10T17:12:00.000Z	rmrfslash		My buddy is a die-hard KDE fan
2009-03-10T17:12:00.000Z	rmrfslash		got me to convert for a little while
2009-03-10T17:12:00.000Z	rmrfslash		I agree KDE is nicer looking w/ "glass-like" effects and stuff
2009-03-10T17:12:00.000Z	rmrfslash		true
2009-03-10T17:14:00.000Z	erUSUL	rmrfslash	your experience is anecdotal and "Anecdotal evidence is not evidence at all" XD
2009-09-04T19:22:00.000Z	erUSUL	rmrfslash	gstreamer
2009-09-04T19:23:00.000Z	erUSUL	rmrfslash	no; totem Rb banshee..
2009-09-04T19:24:00.000Z	erUSUL	rmrfslash	vlc uses its own framwork as does xine
2009-09-04T19:25:00.000Z	erUSUL	rmrfslash	yes amarok uses phonon but phonon is a thing layer on top of gstreamer or libxine or directX (in windows)
2009-09-04T19:26:00.000Z	erUSUL	rmrfslash	thin layer*
2009-09-04T19:26:00.000Z	erUSUL	rmrfslash	yes; and this is getting offtopic... ;P
2009-09-04T19:26:00.000Z	erUSUL	rmrfslash	no problem :)
2010-06-25T19:06:00.000Z	erUSUL	rmrfslash	"grep -i driver /var/log/Xorg.0.log" may help
