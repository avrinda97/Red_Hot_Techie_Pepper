2007-02-21T16:44:00.000Z	phixnay		can anybody help me with cron?
2007-02-21T16:44:00.000Z	betatux	phixnay	what's the problem with cron ?
2007-02-21T16:45:00.000Z	phixnay	betatux	It says there's a problem with the command I want to run
2007-02-21T16:46:00.000Z	betatux	phixnay	have you tried putting in /sbin/shutdown instead of shutdown ?
2007-02-21T16:46:00.000Z	phixnay	betatux	I'll try now
2007-02-21T16:47:00.000Z	phixnay	betatux	also, since shutdown needs root, should I run "sudo crontab -e" instead of "crontab -e"?
2007-02-21T16:47:00.000Z	betatux	phixnay	ofcourse
2007-02-21T16:47:00.000Z	phixnay	betatux	k, thanks
2007-02-21T16:47:00.000Z	betatux	phixnay	can't run shutdown from the regular user cron
2007-02-21T16:49:00.000Z	phixnay	betatux	how does this look?
2007-02-21T16:49:00.000Z	betatux	phixnay	should be ok
2007-02-21T16:51:00.000Z	phixnay	betatux	still says bad command. I'll try putting quotes around it
2007-02-21T16:51:00.000Z	betatux	phixnay	yes try with quotes , good idea
2007-02-21T16:51:00.000Z	phixnay	betatux	still won't work
2007-02-22T17:02:00.000Z	betatux	phixnay	you must not add crond to startup programs in session , cron is started when you're system boots , /etc/init.d/cron restart
2007-02-22T17:06:00.000Z	betatux	phixnay	, you can't send input to a cronjob when it executes
2007-02-22T17:08:00.000Z	betatux	phixnay	you can stop cron by typing : sudo /etc/init.d/cron stop , BUT , it's not recommended because other programs rely on cron
2007-02-22T17:09:00.000Z	betatux	phixnay	type : man at
