2007-06-05T11:28:00.000Z	ohzie	klav	The great thing about Dell's linux laptops is that they're not doing any hardware support, because they're tooooo awesome or something. It's possible that the repositories for those drivers haven't been put into the config file where they're supposed  to be.
2007-06-05T11:28:00.000Z	klav		ohhhhh i see
2007-06-05T11:28:00.000Z	klav		that makes sense
2007-06-05T11:28:00.000Z	klav		cause im not seeing nvidia here
2007-06-05T11:28:00.000Z	ohzie	klav	Just to verify that it actually is, indeed, what is advertised, and to get the numbers off the beginning of the line for your graphics card
