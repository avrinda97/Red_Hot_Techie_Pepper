2008-02-21T04:27:00.000Z	emma		Where are the tool bars on the ubuntu desktop saved? Said another way, what file can I save so that after I comlete reinstall I can revert the configuration of my toolbars?
2008-02-21T04:27:00.000Z	gepatino	emma	its a good idea to backup your entire home dir
2008-02-21T04:27:00.000Z	emma		my home directory is backed up.
2008-02-21T04:28:00.000Z	emma		In fact I have a home partition
2008-02-21T04:28:00.000Z	emma		if I have a home partition will that save the configuration of my tool bars?
2008-02-21T04:28:00.000Z	gepatino	emma	yes, all the configuration for a user is inside his/hers home dir
2008-02-21T04:29:00.000Z	emma		but how does it work if my current home folder has the name emma and then when I reinstall I say my name is emma?
2008-02-21T04:29:00.000Z	emma		how do I avoid trouble there?
2008-02-21T04:29:00.000Z	gepatino	emma	when you reinstall, dont format the home partition ;)
2008-02-21T04:29:00.000Z	emma		i won't but on the reinstall it's going to ask me for my log in name and such and that will be the same
2008-02-21T04:29:00.000Z	emma		which will create two home folders with the name emma and mess thingsup
2008-02-21T04:32:00.000Z	gepatino	emma	you could only have problems if the users ids are different
2008-02-21T04:32:00.000Z	gepatino	emma	to avoid this, you can specify the user id when creating the new user
2008-02-21T04:32:00.000Z	gepatino	emma	and enter the same id you have now
2008-02-21T04:32:00.000Z	emma	gepatino	- that sounds promising.  isn't the user id of the superuser 1000 ?
2008-02-21T04:33:00.000Z	gepatino	emma	no, 1000 is the id of the first user
2008-02-21T04:33:00.000Z	emma		I am the first user
2008-02-21T04:33:00.000Z	gepatino	emma	thats ok. so when reinstalling, enter the same user name, and thats it
2008-02-21T04:34:00.000Z	gepatino	emma	and be shure of selecting '/home' as the mount point for your home partition
