2007-06-01T11:42:00.000Z	jonathan_		by the way
2007-06-01T11:42:00.000Z	jonathan_		I DON'T KNOW HOW TO INSTALLING FILE.TAR.GZ
2007-06-01T11:43:00.000Z	jonathan_		it's hard to install those package
2007-06-01T11:44:00.000Z	jonathan_		ok
2007-06-01T11:44:00.000Z	jonathan_		I'm reading the tips
2007-06-01T11:44:00.000Z	jonathan_		I'm confused
2007-06-01T11:44:00.000Z	jonathan_		to know the diffrent
2007-06-01T11:44:00.000Z	jonathan_		och...
2007-06-01T11:44:00.000Z	jonathan_		tar xzvf?
2007-06-01T11:45:00.000Z	rococo	jonathan_	when a file ends in .tar.gz, think about it like a .zip file in windows. You "unzip" it by running "tar zxvf filename.tar.gz" and then you can get at the contents
2007-06-01T11:46:00.000Z	rococo	jonathan_	usually, installable files that end in .tar.gz is the source code that you're going to have to compile. You decompress it, go in. There's usually a readme file that will give you the info you need on how to compile and install it
2007-06-01T11:47:00.000Z	rococo	jonathan_	yes. you can also extract it using file-roller by doubleclicking on it from the GUI
2007-06-01T11:48:00.000Z	rococo	jonathan_	like I said, after you extract the files, you need to go into the directory that has been extracted. There should be a README file for installing the program from source if it's a program you're trying to install
2007-06-01T11:49:00.000Z	rococo	jonathan_	depends on what it is. almost always, .tar.gz is source code for a program, and there isn't an automated process to install it.
2007-06-01T11:50:00.000Z	rococo	jonathan_	wait, you're installing vmware? why don't you just use synaptic?
2007-06-01T11:51:00.000Z	rococo	jonathan_	so you shouldn't need that .tar.gz file
2007-06-01T11:54:00.000Z	rococo	jonathan_	it worked right out of the box? that's pretty impressive
2007-06-01T11:54:00.000Z	rococo	jonathan_	well, virtual machines are always a lot slower than an OS directly installed on a computer
