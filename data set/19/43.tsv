2012-11-25T02:44:00.000Z	nashant		alright guys. When trying to use sudo I'm getting "sudo: must be setuid root". my root account doesn't have a password. Any solution?
2012-11-25T02:45:00.000Z	nashant		ok, OerHeks, how do I get my sudo working?
2012-11-25T02:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nashant	your first user is in a group called 'sudo' which gives access to the sudo command, when you need admin power, prefix the command with suo
2012-11-25T02:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nashant	what error does sudo give?
2012-11-25T02:47:00.000Z	nashant	ActionParsnip	when I try to sudo I get 'sudo: must be setuid root'
2012-11-25T02:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nashant	is this on a VPS by any chance?>
2012-11-25T02:50:00.000Z	nashant	ActionParsnip	Not a VPS. It's a portable image for linuxonandroid
2012-11-25T02:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nashant	what is the output of:      ls -l `which sudo`; lsb_release -sc
2012-11-25T02:54:00.000Z	nashant	ActionParsnip	-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 45180 Nov 24 21:12 /usr/bin/sudo
2012-11-25T02:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nashant	and:   lsb_release -sc
2012-11-25T02:55:00.000Z	nashant	ActionParsnip	sorry, I left out the 'precise' on a new line after that last one, and for this one just 'precise'
2012-11-25T02:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nashant	sudo chmod +t /usr/bin/sudo
2012-11-25T02:56:00.000Z	nashant	ActionParsnip	sudo: must be setuid root
2012-11-25T02:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nashant	but if you run:   ls -l /usr/bin/sudo       do you see: -rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 123360 Nov 16 14:42 /usr/bin/sudo
2012-11-25T02:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nashant	notice the -rwsr   at the beginning :)
2012-11-25T02:58:00.000Z	nashant	ActionParsnip	I got -rwxr at the beginning
2012-11-25T02:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nashant	then reboot to root recovery mode and you can do it there as root
2012-11-25T03:00:00.000Z	nashant	ActionParsnip	how do I do that from the command line? I'm running a portable image
2012-11-25T03:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nashant	same command.
