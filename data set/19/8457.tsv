2007-03-26T16:06:00.000Z	BFTD		Hi, I get this error when I login, "Unable to find Internet Address please add (system name) to you /etc/hosts file to solve this problem", I am connecting via a wireless device that uses ndiswrapper, and it shows the link light on and blinking which means that it is connected to the router
2007-03-26T16:07:00.000Z	BFTD		anyone?
2007-03-26T16:09:00.000Z	sabiancra	BFTD	do you have an IP, can you ping exteral IPs
2007-03-26T16:09:00.000Z	BFTD	sabiancra	no I can't ping IPs
2007-03-26T16:10:00.000Z	sabiancra	BFTD	do you have an IP from your router
2007-03-26T16:10:00.000Z	BFTD	sabiancra	yes it does give me one
2007-03-26T16:10:00.000Z	sabiancra		can you ping the router
2007-03-26T16:11:00.000Z	sabiancra	BFTD	can you ping the router
2007-03-26T16:11:00.000Z	BFTD	sabiancra	let me try
2007-03-26T16:12:00.000Z	BFTD	sabiancra	yes I can
2007-03-26T16:13:00.000Z	sabiancra	BFTD	trying pinging 128.210.7.199
2007-03-26T16:13:00.000Z	BFTD	sabiancra	"destination to host unreachable"
2007-03-26T16:14:00.000Z	sabiancra		ok, seems like your router is blocking your IP
2007-03-26T16:14:00.000Z	BFTD		I ping gogle.com and get "unknown host gogle.com"
2007-03-26T16:14:00.000Z	BFTD	sabiancra	oh?
2007-03-26T16:14:00.000Z	sabiancra	BFTD	right, because it cannot resolve the hostname to a DNS
2007-03-26T16:14:00.000Z	sabiancra	BFTD	yes, either that or your router/modem isn't working at all
2007-03-26T16:14:00.000Z	BFTD	sabiancra	I can probably figure it out then, thanks
2007-03-26T16:15:00.000Z	sabiancra	BFTD	check to see if you have a MAC address list set up on the router
