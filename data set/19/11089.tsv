2006-03-27T06:08:00.000Z	jayg		anyone got any audigy experience with breezy?
2006-03-27T06:08:00.000Z	crimsun	jayg	sure
2006-03-27T06:09:00.000Z	crimsun	jayg	pastebin the following: lspci -v && lspci -nv && cat /proc/asound/cards && amixer -c0
2006-03-27T06:12:00.000Z	crimsun	jayg	execute that long command I gave you
2006-03-27T06:12:00.000Z	crimsun	jayg	take the output, paste it onto the pastebin Web site, then tell me the url
2006-03-27T06:23:00.000Z	crimsun	jayg	the first thing you need to do now is execute ``sudo update-pciids'' in a Terminal
2006-03-27T06:24:00.000Z	crimsun	jayg	now re-pastebin
2006-03-27T06:25:00.000Z	crimsun	jayg	no, that long command
2006-03-27T06:31:00.000Z	crimsun	jayg	your soundcard wasn't supported until extremely recently, as in March 6th
2006-03-27T06:32:00.000Z	crimsun	jayg	you can compile alsa-driver cvs manually, or you can try current dapper
2006-03-27T06:32:00.000Z	jayg	crimsun	going way over my head there mate lol, but tried dapper live, never had sound with that either
2006-03-27T06:34:00.000Z	crimsun	jayg	dapper flight 5 wouldn't have supported it, since the patch I submitted wasn't available in our kernel until yesterday
2006-03-27T06:34:00.000Z	crimsun	jayg	hence the need for "current" dapper
2006-03-27T06:34:00.000Z	jayg	crimsun	if i download new dapper, it *should* work?
2006-03-27T06:35:00.000Z	crimsun	jayg	try a current live cd: http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/daily-live/current/
2006-03-27T06:45:00.000Z	jayg	crimsun	if the current *daily* live cd works with soundcard, just install the latest daily dapper then?
2006-03-27T06:45:00.000Z	crimsun	jayg	well, that depends if you want to run dapper.
2006-03-27T06:45:00.000Z	crimsun	jayg	keep in mind that it's still in development (until 1 june)
2006-03-27T06:47:00.000Z	jayg	crimsun	and 1st of june, isnt that far away :)
