2006-09-21T12:34:00.000Z	SimonAnibal-Work		boy I'm getting a lot of "Could not mark all packages for installation or upgrade" errors in Synaptic while following Community Ubuntu Documentations
2006-09-21T12:35:00.000Z	SimonAnibal-Work		Lots of unresolvable dependencies
2006-09-21T12:36:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	SimonAnibal-Work	I must ask... Have you run scripts like Automatix, (NOT recommending that you do.) to install anything?
2006-09-21T12:36:00.000Z	SimonAnibal-Work	Jack_Sparrow	No I've not, last time I did, it crashed webpages with flash content. I started from scratch using the Ubuntu Community Documentation and I simply can't install the packages it says I should.
2006-09-21T12:37:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	SimonAnibal-Work	Did you do a full reinstall after you tried it ?
2006-09-21T12:38:00.000Z	SimonAnibal-Work	Jack_Sparrow	Nodnod, full reinstall just this morning, the only other things I've done since the full reinstall was install aiglx+compiz
2006-09-21T12:39:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	SimonAnibal-Work	You might have better luck in that channel.... if all you did was freash install and compiz
