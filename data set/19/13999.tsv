2005-03-31T17:20:00.000Z	ermo		I hear you. That internet never seems to work quite like one wants it to.
2005-03-31T11:08:00.000Z	ermo		Could anyone help me install a .desktop so that it shows up in Applications/Sound & Video (hoary)?
2005-03-31T11:09:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ermo	you run warty or hoary ?
2005-03-31T11:09:00.000Z	ermo	LinuxJones	as I indicated: (hoary)
2005-03-31T11:10:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ermo	you are going to have to install a menu editor, it was jsut released yesterday
2005-03-31T11:10:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ermo	let me see if I can find it for you
2005-03-31T11:10:00.000Z	ermo	LinuxJones	really? thanks a bunch m8
2005-03-31T11:11:00.000Z	ermo	LinuxJones	DOH. Lemme doublecheck how it's done in /usr/share/applications (silly me)
2005-03-31T11:12:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ermo	>> http://dev.realistanew.com/menu-editor/menueditor_0.1-1_i386.deb
2005-03-31T11:13:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ermo	download and sudo -s to get to a root console, dpkg -i menueditor_0.1-1_i386.deb and meun-editor to run it .....has to be run by root user
2005-03-31T11:13:00.000Z	ermo	LinuxJones	is that because it edits the /usr/share/applications directory?
2005-03-31T11:15:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ermo	no
2005-03-31T11:16:00.000Z	ermo	LinuxJones	then why do I need root? If it edits ~/.local/share/applications, I shouldn't need root. In fact, it would be detrimental..
2005-03-31T11:17:00.000Z	ermo	LinuxJones	but thx for the pointer
2005-03-31T11:17:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ermo	;)
2005-03-31T11:18:00.000Z	ermo	LinuxJones	also, the newest version supports non-root editing, it would seem.
2005-03-31T11:19:00.000Z	ermo	LinuxJones	the newest is 0.2-1 (not 0.1-1)
2005-03-31T11:19:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ermo	he must have changed it recently :)
2005-03-31T11:22:00.000Z	ermo	LinuxJones	bad bad bad Travis Watkins. He hasn't included python docstrings *waves fist at mr. Watkins*
