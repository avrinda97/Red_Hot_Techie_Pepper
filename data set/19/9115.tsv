2007-07-22T13:23:00.000Z	dr_willis	IndyGunFreak	 Linspire released the CNR stuff to the GPL i think. so it is Linspires. :)
2007-07-22T13:23:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	dr_willis	well, cnr is just to friggin slow, i hate it...
2007-07-22T13:23:00.000Z	dr_willis	IndyGunFreak	 yep. i agree
2007-07-22T13:24:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	dr_willis	really when you think aout it, synaptic is ubuntu's versionm of CNR, its got a ton of software youu can install with 1 or 2 click
2007-07-22T13:24:00.000Z	dr_willis	IndyGunFreak	 cnr is just callint the apt-get stuff from what ive seen. :) with a purty web interface
2007-07-22T13:25:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	dr_willis	yep, i'd rather See Ubuntu/Canonical, whatever, focus on getting popular programs into the repositories, so that compiling isn't necessary, screw cnr
2007-07-22T13:27:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	dr_willis	this is interesting.. look at the poll   http://www.desktoplinux.com/news/NS7474779842.html
2007-07-22T13:28:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	dr_willis	if you add the two NO options, its pretty close to half the community says no thanks.
2007-07-22T13:28:00.000Z	dr_willis	IndyGunFreak	 :)  No way! Linspire is evil and I want nothing to do with them! (9 percent)
2007-07-22T13:28:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	dr_willis	i consider that sidebyside with the first one... to just use apt
2008-11-09T11:41:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	dr_willis	lol, are you neurotic?... Gnome/KDE have little in common
2008-11-09T11:42:00.000Z	dr_willis	IndyGunFreak	 On solaris they look the same as if they were on Linux - is what i ment.
2009-05-01T05:42:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	dr_willis	pinch, poke, you owe me a coke.
