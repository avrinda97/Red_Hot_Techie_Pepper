2011-04-24T11:53:00.000Z	botcity	MK``	have you tried tail -f /var/log/messages  before inserting the cd for any kernel messages ?
2011-04-24T11:56:00.000Z	MK``	botcity	kernel: [49009.575307] cdrom: This disc doesn't have any tracks I recognize!
2011-04-24T11:59:00.000Z	botcity	MK``	are you sure you have the right disks ? e.g. dvd or cd-r ?
2011-04-24T12:03:00.000Z	botcity	MK``	what software are you using to burn ,and what are you burning ?
2011-04-24T12:11:00.000Z	MK``	botcity	No I mean... the disk utility sees it as a disk with a single 2kb sector, any utility I use sees it this way as well. I was burning a ubuntu isos.
2011-04-24T12:11:00.000Z	botcity	MK``	do you have any other live cds or operating systems you can boot so you can compare the reading of the cds. to see if it is ubuntu ?
2011-04-24T12:13:00.000Z	MK``	botcity	I was more wondering if I can sort of get the system to refresh the way it is looking at the drive, I am pretty sure rebooting will fix this
2011-04-24T12:13:00.000Z	MK``	botcity	I checked all the disks on another PC and they work properly there, if that's what you mean.
2011-04-24T12:14:00.000Z	botcity	MK``	is ubuntu on that pc ?
2011-04-24T12:16:00.000Z	botcity	MK``	what is the model pc you are having problems with? and ubuntu version ?
2011-04-24T12:16:00.000Z	MK``	botcity	10.10, it's a gateway laptop. I've burned like 40 CDs on this already, this issue came out of nowhere
2011-04-24T12:25:00.000Z	botcity	MK``	does your laptop recognize the other disks you burned ?
2011-04-24T12:28:00.000Z	MK``	botcity	when I insert the disks it's throwing mounting errors, however if I select to mount the volume manually it works
2011-04-24T12:29:00.000Z	botcity	MK``	 can you paste bin the errors ? and post the link.
2011-04-24T12:32:00.000Z	MK``	botcity	"Unable to mount Xubuntu 10.04.2 i386" "Error mounting: mount: /dev/sr0 already mounted or /media/Xubuntu 10.04.2 i386 busy" is the popup
2011-04-24T12:35:00.000Z	botcity	MK``	 are all the cds you are burning iso's?
2011-04-24T12:56:00.000Z	botcity	MK``	 can you boot one  of those iso's you have burned for test purposes ? from you laptop..
2011-04-25T05:04:00.000Z	botcity	MK``	did you fix your disk problem?
2011-04-25T05:05:00.000Z	MK``	botcity	no, gave up for now
