2006-08-31T09:05:00.000Z	tecta		you don't have to download a cd to update the distro each time, right?
2006-08-31T09:05:00.000Z	ladydoor	tecta	nope!
2006-08-31T09:06:00.000Z	ladydoor	tecta	pretty much
2006-08-31T09:06:00.000Z	tecta	ladydoor	what's the diff between updating the distro and all the pkg's?
2006-08-31T09:06:00.000Z	ladydoor	tecta	because before doing the dist-upgrade you change which repositories you're looking in
2006-08-31T09:06:00.000Z	ladydoor	tecta	permanently
2006-08-31T09:07:00.000Z	tecta	ladydoor	oh ok.. so do dist-upgrade first?
2006-08-31T09:07:00.000Z	ladydoor	tecta	wat're you trying to do?
2006-08-31T09:07:00.000Z	tecta	ladydoor	well i have a old ubuntu cd, and don't wanna download a new one...
2006-08-31T09:08:00.000Z	ladydoor	tecta	aha. well, what you'll do is edit your /etc/apt/sources.list so that instead of "breezy" or "hoary" it says "dapper"
2006-08-31T09:08:00.000Z	ladydoor	tecta	you'll see what i'm talking about
2006-08-31T09:08:00.000Z	tecta	ladydoor	alright... then just do apt-get dist-upgrade ?
2006-08-31T09:09:00.000Z	ladydoor	tecta	first, do sudo apt-get update
2006-08-31T09:09:00.000Z	ladydoor	tecta	then do sudo apt-get upgrade
2006-08-31T09:09:00.000Z	tecta	ladydoor	so apt-get update updates all the pkgs, then apt-get upgrade updates the mirrors?
2006-08-31T09:11:00.000Z	ladydoor	tecta	no...sudo apt-get update downloads the latest list of packages (the most up-to-date one available in the repositories in the /etc/apt/sources.list)
2006-08-31T09:11:00.000Z	ladydoor	tecta	and then sudo apt-get upgrade upgrades any packages
2006-08-31T09:11:00.000Z	ladydoor	tecta	and sudo apt-get dist-upgrade upgrades your whole system
2006-08-31T09:11:00.000Z	tecta	ladydoor	oh ok i see
