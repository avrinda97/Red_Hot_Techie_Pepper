2008-07-22T13:36:00.000Z	new2nix	mrrrti	how would i do that
2008-07-22T13:37:00.000Z	mrrrti	new2nix	did you miss my question?
2008-07-22T13:38:00.000Z	new2nix	mrrrti	sorry, im not sure if its starting x or not as I am quite new to *nix and have only used command line until today
2008-07-22T13:40:00.000Z	mrrrti	new2nix	you should use your normal account. i see that you're root there.
2008-07-22T13:40:00.000Z	new2nix	mrrrti	i only ever login as root
2008-07-22T13:43:00.000Z	mrrrti	new2nix	the installation should have asked you about a "normal" user
2008-07-22T13:44:00.000Z	mrrrti	new2nix	grep ^adm /etc/group
2008-07-22T13:45:00.000Z	new2nix	mrrrti	adm:*:4:
