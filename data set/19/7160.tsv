2008-07-27T06:18:00.000Z	miranda		okay this is another question related to the computer that I am working with...
2008-07-27T06:19:00.000Z	miranda		it says that I have 3000MB and that I need 5000MB
2008-07-27T06:21:00.000Z	miranda		is there a version of ubuntu where I can install with less memory because I am deleting all of the files to make more memory
2008-07-27T06:22:00.000Z	bazhang	miranda	how little ram we talking
2008-07-27T06:24:00.000Z	bazhang	miranda	64mb may not do it; fluxbuntu perhaps but even that is a stretch
2008-07-27T06:24:00.000Z	miranda	bazhang	I am updating from windows 98
2008-07-27T06:29:00.000Z	bazhang	miranda	no
2008-07-27T09:46:00.000Z	bazhang	miranda	not your hdd, need to add ram
2008-07-27T09:47:00.000Z	bazhang	miranda	you are referring to hard drive space; though with 64mb of ram it is a moot point
2008-07-27T09:47:00.000Z	bazhang	miranda	you have kubuntu installed successfully with only 64mb of ram?
2008-07-27T09:48:00.000Z	miranda	bazhang	no I am trying to install
2008-07-27T09:48:00.000Z	bazhang	miranda	no way kubuntu will install on that tiny amount of ram
2008-07-27T09:48:00.000Z	miranda	bazhang	ok what do you suggest?
2008-07-27T09:49:00.000Z	bazhang	miranda	is adding ram just not an option? you insist on running that system as is?
2008-07-27T09:50:00.000Z	miranda	bazhang	yes
2008-07-27T09:50:00.000Z	miranda	bazhang	SDRAM =  RAM right?
2008-07-27T09:51:00.000Z	bazhang	miranda	yes, as is?
2008-07-27T09:51:00.000Z	bazhang	miranda	care to join #ubuntu-offtopic ?
2008-07-27T09:52:00.000Z	miranda	bazhang	ok
