2009-06-21T20:10:00.000Z	MFen		anybody know any tricks on increasing the overall volume of the sound card?  i get *much* louder sound, with no distortion, when i boot this laptop into windows
2009-06-21T20:10:00.000Z	Walex	MFen	enable the builtin amplifier perhaps?
2009-06-21T20:10:00.000Z	MFen	Walex	sounds good. how does that work
2009-06-21T20:13:00.000Z	Walex	MFen	just one of the controls in the mixer controls./
2009-06-21T20:13:00.000Z	MFen	Walex	everything in the mixer is up to max
2009-06-21T20:14:00.000Z	Walex	MFen	it is a boolean control.
2009-06-21T20:17:00.000Z	MFen	Walex	i don't have any switches that say amplifier
2009-06-21T20:18:00.000Z	Walex	MFen	then perhaps your chipset type is not quite perfectly supported by the driver. There are many variants.
2009-06-21T20:18:00.000Z	Walex	MFen	anyhow, try to check which controls you have with 'amixer controls' just to double check.
2009-06-21T20:19:00.000Z	Walex	MFen	you may even have one of those card without a hw volume control, they need the 'softvol' ALSA plugin.
2009-06-21T20:20:00.000Z	MFen	Walex	yeah "amixer controls" shows stuff i already have access to
2009-06-21T20:20:00.000Z	MFen	Walex	i dunno, it's ALC662 using hda intel
2009-06-21T20:20:00.000Z	Walex	MFen	the name may be not entirely obvious. But maybe one of the other cases apply.
2009-06-21T20:21:00.000Z	Walex	MFen	there are dozens of variants of intel HDA, all with very subtly different mixer registers.
2009-06-21T20:22:00.000Z	Walex	MFen	try 'modinfo snd-hda-intel', the driver modules has some parameters to select particular variants.
2009-06-21T20:22:00.000Z	MFen	Walex	oh, neat.
2009-06-21T20:22:00.000Z	MFen	Walex	there's a "model" parameter, but no list of the models i can use
2009-06-21T20:23:00.000Z	Walex	MFen	the list is in the manual and docs.
2009-06-21T20:26:00.000Z	MFen	Walex	i'm seeing suggestions to use "model=laptop" option. i'll try that.
