2011-07-04T04:12:00.000Z	tonytraductor		oh, the weirde IP address was just where I was opening the firewall
2011-07-04T04:14:00.000Z	tonytraductor		the firewall has its own IP address?
2011-07-04T04:14:00.000Z	tonytraductor		this is so much easier on my home network with my linksys router
2011-07-04T04:14:00.000Z	tonytraductor		this is some BS att webinterface thingy
2011-07-04T04:15:00.000Z	tonytraductor		like, this applies http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080525115025AABbdaQ
2011-07-04T04:16:00.000Z	tonytraductor		this interface says NOTHING about port forwarding.  My linksys has PORT FORWARDING, which makes sense...this thing is completely idiotic.
2011-07-04T04:17:00.000Z	tonytraductor		yes
2011-07-04T04:17:00.000Z	tonytraductor		there is a place to p" open the firewall"  to allow " applications"  through (ssh is listed in " application" , and it says "Choose the computer that will host applications through the firewall:"  lists 2 ip addresses, ne\ither of which is this machine
2011-07-04T04:18:00.000Z	tonytraductor		something about Public Proxied Subnet (NAT/Routed)

2011-07-04T04:22:00.000Z	guvnor	tonytraductor	let him into your router
2011-07-04T04:22:00.000Z	guvnor	tonytraductor	just tell us the exact model
2011-07-04T04:23:00.000Z	guvnor	tonytraductor	tell us the model
2011-07-04T04:33:00.000Z	guvnor	tonytraductor	you want on PC to have inbound traffic routed to it? Is that what you are going for?

2011-07-04T04:40:00.000Z	guvnor	tonytraductor	i salute you, sir
2011-07-04T04:45:00.000Z	guvnor	tonytraductor	no, it shouldn't either.
2011-07-04T04:49:00.000Z	guvnor	tonytraductor	strangely that is how your computer and the router communicate - through those IP addresses
2011-07-04T04:50:00.000Z	guvnor	tonytraductor	either the router gives the PC an address (dhcp) or you create a static address on the PC and the router accepts that
