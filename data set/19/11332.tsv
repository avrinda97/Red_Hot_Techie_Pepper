2008-11-22T11:00:00.000Z	doc|home	Jason_	I don't have mic volume as an option there
2008-11-22T11:01:00.000Z	doc|home	Jason_	actually, I do, both are tied to each other and up to full volume
2008-11-22T11:03:00.000Z	Jason_	doc|home	and mute is disabled (right click speaker icon, select "open volume control", ensure Mic is not muted
2008-11-22T11:03:00.000Z	doc|home	Jason_	it's not
2008-11-22T11:03:00.000Z	doc|home		:/
2008-11-22T11:04:00.000Z	doc|home	Jason_	what does "mic as output" do?
2008-11-22T11:06:00.000Z	Jason_	doc|home	i would assume that would set the mic as the recording device
2008-11-22T11:06:00.000Z	Jason_	doc|home	on my system i see several devices including two capture devices with independent mic settings
2008-11-22T11:07:00.000Z	doc|home	Jason_	should the mic not be an input?
2008-11-22T11:07:00.000Z	Jason_	doc|home	it should
2008-11-22T11:07:00.000Z	doc|home		so mic as output should be off?
2008-11-22T11:08:00.000Z	Jason_	doc|home	sorry, I don't have a similar system here to test. My gf has a XPS 1550 but not here.
2008-11-22T11:08:00.000Z	doc|home	Jason_	no worries, has she gotten the mic working on hers?
2008-11-22T11:08:00.000Z	doc|home		this is a plug in mic, not the built in one
2008-11-22T11:10:00.000Z	Jason_	doc|home	not sure, she runs vista - but I can always run the live-cd and see if it works. As long as the drivers support your system and the mic setting is correct, it shouldn't matter if the mic is internal or external (I would think).
2008-11-22T11:11:00.000Z	doc|home	Jason_	hmmm, ok, well, thanks anyway
2008-11-22T11:11:00.000Z	Jason_	doc|home	sorry i couldn't be more useful
2008-11-22T11:12:00.000Z	Jason_	doc|home	did you have it working on a prior version of Ubuntu (or another linux distro)?
2008-11-22T11:37:00.000Z	doc|home	Jason_	sorry, was eating. Nope, new laptop, never used any other distro with it
