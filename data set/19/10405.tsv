2006-06-23T05:03:00.000Z	sysdoc	jrib	thank you
2006-06-23T05:03:00.000Z	jrib	sysdoc	that page doesn't have requirements, but if you can run breezy, then dapper should be ok
2006-06-24T12:29:00.000Z	jrib	sysdoc	can't you run 'xhost +' as your user so that anyone can connect to your session?
2006-06-24T12:31:00.000Z	sysdoc	jrib	sorry not sure I follow that line of thinking
2006-06-24T12:31:00.000Z	sysdoc	jrib	at least not familliar I should say
2006-06-24T12:32:00.000Z	jrib	sysdoc	run 'xhost +' as your user, you can man xhost for more info because I will admit I don't understand the details.  Then try opening gedit again
2006-06-24T12:32:00.000Z	sysdoc	jrib	thx dewd
2008-11-08T20:43:00.000Z	sysdoc	jrib	 lol
2010-02-10T05:24:00.000Z	jrib	sysdoc	erm, did you run "check the cd for defects"?
2010-02-10T05:24:00.000Z	sysdoc	jrib	yea I did
2010-02-10T05:25:00.000Z	jrib	sysdoc	the live environment loads fine?
2010-02-10T05:25:00.000Z	sysdoc	jrib	no it won't load either
2010-02-10T05:25:00.000Z	jrib	sysdoc	the only difference can't be the hard drive right?
2010-02-10T05:26:00.000Z	sysdoc	jrib	I have checked the image, burnt many CD's and checked the CD's after, and all the tweaks that are available from the installer, and they all hang
2010-02-10T05:27:00.000Z	jrib	sysdoc	you installed without issue on the same system with a different hard drive?
2010-02-10T05:28:00.000Z	sysdoc	jrib	no the HD is already in the sys too, just have fedora on that disk that I'd like to format to the ext4 fs and install ubuntu to that drive
2010-02-10T05:28:00.000Z	sysdoc	jrib	in essence moving my existing ubuntu install to the larger HD
2010-02-10T05:28:00.000Z	jrib	sysdoc	I'd say just try the alternat cd
2010-02-10T05:29:00.000Z	sysdoc	jrib	ah forgot about the alt cd
