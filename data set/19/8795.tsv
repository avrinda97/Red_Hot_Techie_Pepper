2007-05-04T06:41:00.000Z	PiNE		my cursor is really jumpy... has anyone else experienced this?  how would i fix it?
2007-05-04T06:42:00.000Z	sethk	PiNE	that's usually caused by using the wrong mouse driver in xorg.conf
2007-05-04T06:45:00.000Z	PiNE	sethk	how would i find out what driver to use?
2007-05-04T06:46:00.000Z	sethk	PiNE	what mouse?
2007-05-04T06:47:00.000Z	PiNE	sethk	synaptic touchpad
2007-05-04T06:47:00.000Z	PiNE	sethk	on a toshiba satellite
2007-05-04T06:48:00.000Z	sethk	PiNE	can you paste the mouse config from your xorg.conf?
2007-05-04T06:48:00.000Z	sethk	PiNE	or just paste the entire xorg.conf
2007-05-04T06:48:00.000Z	PiNE	sethk	yep... it will take me a second.
2007-05-04T06:51:00.000Z	PiNE	sethk	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/19059/
2007-05-04T06:53:00.000Z	sethk	PiNE	the config looks correct
2007-05-04T06:54:00.000Z	sethk	PiNE	it's a complex configuration.  I wonder if the wacom stuff is stepping on the touchpad stuff.
2007-05-04T06:54:00.000Z	sethk	PiNE	first thing I'd try is changing the protocol.  I'll have to look up what you can change it to.  google for xorg and synaptics and protocol, and see what appears.
2007-05-04T06:55:00.000Z	PiNE	sethk	 i have a previous xorg saved where my mouse was working fine i will try comparing the two line for line.
2007-05-04T06:55:00.000Z	sethk	PiNE	good idea
2007-05-04T06:55:00.000Z	PiNE	sethk	and i'll google that stuff right now!
2007-05-04T06:56:00.000Z	PiNE	sethk	what is wacom?
2007-05-04T06:56:00.000Z	sethk	PiNE	tablet
2007-05-04T06:57:00.000Z	PiNE	sethk	well, thanks for the help.
