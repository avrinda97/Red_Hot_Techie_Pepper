2011-08-27T10:59:00.000Z	mokti	urlin2u	thanks
2011-08-27T11:00:00.000Z	urlin2u	mokti	no problem, I use ubuntu tweak even though I know how to remove this stuff and do otherthings it offers.
2011-08-27T11:06:00.000Z	urlin2u	mokti	ubuntu doesn't have a rollback function, but you can remove stuff, and change the driver.  Have you logged out or rebooted to see if it fixes your problems?
2011-08-27T11:06:00.000Z	mokti	urlin2u	yes
2011-08-27T11:07:00.000Z	urlin2u	mokti	have you been messing with compiz?
2011-08-27T11:07:00.000Z	mokti	urlin2u	no, NVIDIA drivers
2011-08-27T11:08:00.000Z	urlin2u	mokti	where did you get the driver from?
2011-08-27T11:08:00.000Z	mokti	urlin2u	want to go back to the default settings/driver to display at the correct resolution (unless you can help me with that :) )
2011-08-27T11:09:00.000Z	urlin2u	mokti	graphic drivers are not really something I'm real familiar with all my computers work out of the gate.
