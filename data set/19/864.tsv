2011-10-29T05:14:00.000Z	atannus		If I leave de CD to work, it will go past the "little human and keyboard" to the splash with ubuntu logo and the 5 little dots. They blink for a while, then the screen flashes and goes blank. If, at the "human and keyboard" I hit space, I get the menu. I followed all 3 solutions here (http://journalxtra.com/2010/07/ubuntu-fixing-the-blank-screen-on-installation-bug/) that is how I get the "broken but not blank" screen. Since that post is about a
2011-10-29T05:14:00.000Z	atannus		notebook with graphics issue, and that *changes* the symptoms for me, I'm thinking Graphics Adapter... I don't know what other options I can try, though.
2011-10-29T05:15:00.000Z	atannus		I tried Desktop versions for 10.10 and 11.04, but thei fail as well...
2011-10-29T05:16:00.000Z	yeats	atannus	you tried the alternate CD for those versions?
2011-10-29T05:17:00.000Z	atannus	yeats	I'd heard of them, but no. I'll try 11.04 now, I assume that's best for G. Adapter coverage. Do I assume right?
2011-10-29T05:18:00.000Z	yeats	atannus	I don't know about G. Adapter coverage, but if the computer is older, you might go with 10.04
2011-10-29T05:19:00.000Z	yeats	atannus	11.10 requires a bit more video horsepower than previous releases to work well
2011-10-29T05:19:00.000Z	atannus	yeats	I'm downloading 10.04, let's see where that takes me. Thanks.
2011-10-29T05:19:00.000Z	yeats	atannus	hope it works for you
2011-10-29T05:45:00.000Z	atannus	yeats	while I'm downloading, I've tried some different settings (as per that link I mentioned above), I was able to get to a prompt, ubuntu@ubuntu, before which there was a message about missing CPU security features. ("your cpu appears to be lacking expected security protections"). Does that say anything to you?

2011-10-29T05:46:00.000Z	yeats	atannus	but it shouldn't be a huge worry IMHO
2011-10-29T05:49:00.000Z	atannus	yeats	I messed around with the bios, so I'm gonna reset it and see what happens! :)
2011-10-29T05:49:00.000Z	atannus	yeats	frustrated dude here....
2011-10-29T05:50:00.000Z	yeats	atannus	I think we've all been there ;-)

2011-10-29T05:52:00.000Z	atannus	yeats	wanna type something? I'll proxy it! ;)
2011-10-29T06:18:00.000Z	atannus	yeats	neat text mode blue screen. fingers crossed.
2011-10-29T06:20:00.000Z	atannus	yeats	it is complaining I don't have a CD-ROM in the driver.... that's not right.
