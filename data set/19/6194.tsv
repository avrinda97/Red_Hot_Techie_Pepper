2008-02-27T07:22:00.000Z	davmonster		build-essential doesn't
2008-02-27T07:23:00.000Z	davmonster		apt-get install linux-source-(uname -r)
2008-02-27T07:23:00.000Z	davmonster		or linux-headers-$(uname -r)
2008-02-27T07:23:00.000Z	davmonster		or something
2008-02-27T07:24:00.000Z	cpurn	davmonster	woulnd't that install the latest kernel available for other release, i.e. edgy, where I'd  like to keep in track with LTS still?
2008-02-27T07:24:00.000Z	davmonster		it would install source of your kernel version
2008-02-27T07:24:00.000Z	davmonster		that's what uname -r does
2008-02-27T07:26:00.000Z	cpurn		I have been running 2.6.15.7 for a while, I  had to custom package the kernel for some reasons.  I'm thinkingo f upgrading my custom package kernel to the latest available...
2008-02-27T07:26:00.000Z	cpurn		davmas: so I was looking at the latest... I think I get it
2008-02-27T07:26:00.000Z	cpurn		I'll give it a try...thanks
2008-02-27T07:27:00.000Z	davmonster	cpurn	type uname -r on a console
2008-02-27T07:27:00.000Z	davmonster	cpurn	to see what it does
2008-02-27T07:27:00.000Z	cpurn		2.6.15.7-ubuntu1-custom
2008-02-27T07:27:00.000Z	davmonster		heh okay
2008-02-27T07:27:00.000Z	cpurn		it's custom kernel that I packaged a while back
2008-02-27T07:27:00.000Z	cpurn		it's not from the tree
2008-02-27T07:27:00.000Z	cpurn		I had to recompile this kernel by hand and hand picked the modules
2008-02-27T07:28:00.000Z	davmonster	cpurn	sorry, that's beyond my expertise :(
2008-02-27T07:28:00.000Z	cpurn	davmonster	roger that, thanks for helping and trying! :)
