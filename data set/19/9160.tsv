2007-01-24T15:17:00.000Z	Atomix		im confused though, can anyone help?
2007-01-24T15:17:00.000Z	Atomix		i get an error
2007-01-24T15:17:00.000Z	Atomix		and what is a partition
2007-01-24T15:17:00.000Z	lynucs	Atomix	you can, but windows will overwrite your mbr.. that means you will have to install grub again
2007-01-24T15:18:00.000Z	lynucs	Atomix	do you want to delete linux completely?
2007-01-24T15:19:00.000Z	lynucs	Atomix	did you create an extra partition for win?
2007-01-24T15:19:00.000Z	lynucs	Atomix	so you want to keep ubuntu and install windows, right?
2007-01-24T15:20:00.000Z	lynucs	Atomix	ok then you have to create "place" on your hard disk for win
2007-01-24T15:20:00.000Z	lynucs	Atomix	in other words youll have to create a partition
2007-01-24T15:21:00.000Z	lynucs	Atomix	at fiirst you would need top backup your files
2007-01-24T15:21:00.000Z	lynucs	Atomix	becuse resizing partitions is allways risky
2007-01-24T15:22:00.000Z	lynucs	Atomix	then google dor qtparted
2007-01-24T15:22:00.000Z	lynucs	Atomix	thats a tool for resizing partition
2007-01-24T15:24:00.000Z	lynucs	Atomix	you told you want keep ubuntu?
2007-01-24T15:24:00.000Z	lynucs	Atomix	then just start your windows cd, and choose delete partitions
2007-01-24T15:27:00.000Z	lynucs	Atomix	put your wincd into your drive and reboot pc
2007-01-24T15:27:00.000Z	lynucs	Atomix	and make sure in bios, thta your machine tries to start from cd-rom first
