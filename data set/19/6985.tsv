2007-10-28T11:37:00.000Z	linuxocalypse	francis	Answer...build your own box. :-)
2007-10-28T11:40:00.000Z	linuxocalypse	francis	Put your ear to it, if it sounds like it's running, then it is..otherwise, you're cooking your CPU
2007-10-28T11:42:00.000Z	francis	linuxocalypse	the cpu fan is certainly runing
2007-10-28T11:43:00.000Z	linuxocalypse	francis	Okay....and I should ask, do you have a desktop or a laptop?
2007-10-28T11:43:00.000Z	linuxocalypse	francis	Does your lappy have side vents?
2007-10-28T11:44:00.000Z	francis	linuxocalypse	it does have side vents
2007-10-28T11:45:00.000Z	linuxocalypse	francis	What does your screen look like....any red spots?
2007-10-28T11:45:00.000Z	francis	linuxocalypse	jsut checked the cpu is running at 47
2007-10-28T11:46:00.000Z	linuxocalypse	francis	So...the video is okay? What makes you think the vid card is running hot?
2007-10-28T11:47:00.000Z	linuxocalypse	francis	Then I would have it checked out.
2007-10-28T11:48:00.000Z	linuxocalypse	francis	It's a laptop, so I'm not sure how, but waiting on someone to tell you is waiting for impending damage to it. :-)
2007-10-28T11:50:00.000Z	francis	linuxocalypse	i have been using the laptop for about 4 months now
