2012-02-25T07:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TUX11	run:  sudo -i   and you wil get a root console
2012-02-25T07:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TUX11	if you want to exit it, run:  exit
2012-02-25T07:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TUX11	yes, the OS runs as user which gives a greater level of security, your user is in a group called 'admin' which allows you to use sudo and gksudo (and kdesu in kde)
2012-02-25T07:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TUX11	after the OS is setup, you rarely need sudo as you are just using the OS
2012-02-25T07:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TUX11	well you are doing an admin task, so will need to authenticate
2012-02-25T07:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TUX11	its a poor user model
2012-02-25T07:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TUX11	you run every app as admin, including web facing apps
2012-02-25T07:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TUX11	so any malicious thing you bump into will get that access, so you get all sorts of stuff installed
2012-02-25T07:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TUX11	with the ubuntu model there can be no external installs as it all needs ratifying with sudo. no need to be careful
2012-02-26T06:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TUX11	nautilus will do it
