2010-04-25T18:18:00.000Z	uLinux		I uninstalled TeamSpeak but .teamspeak2 folder still exists. Can I remove it? Why doesn't Ubuntu automatically delete it?

2010-04-25T18:21:00.000Z	iceroot	uLinux	apt-get remove --purge  to remove everything the program is creating (not in ~)
2010-04-25T18:23:00.000Z	iceroot	uLinux	because you are using it "wrong" witouht --purge apt-get is not removing conffiles
2010-04-25T18:23:00.000Z	uLinux	iceroot	I used ubuntu software center to uninstall it
2010-04-25T18:23:00.000Z	iceroot	uLinux	there should be also the option for purge
2010-04-25T18:24:00.000Z	uLinux	iceroot	 just a Remove button
2010-04-25T18:24:00.000Z	iceroot	uLinux	hm, dont know, i never use a gui for sotware-management
2010-04-25T18:25:00.000Z	iceroot	uLinux	or use apt-get directly
2010-04-25T18:25:00.000Z	iceroot	uLinux	+ packagename
2010-04-25T18:26:00.000Z	iceroot	uLinux	i guess its called teamspeak-client and teamspeak-server
2010-04-25T18:27:00.000Z	iceroot	uLinux	its only removing conffiles which are created with postinst, rules and so on, nothing you created by starting the program like configs in the home-dir
2010-04-25T18:29:00.000Z	iceroot	uLinux	i told you already what purge is doing
2010-06-01T22:38:00.000Z	iceroot	uLinux	put it in your path-directories
2010-06-01T22:38:00.000Z	uLinux	iceroot	what do you mean
2010-06-01T22:39:00.000Z	iceroot	uLinux	echo $PATH  everything it that directorys can be accessed directly
2010-06-01T22:44:00.000Z	uLinux	iceroot	everything ca ben accessed directly
2010-10-29T14:20:00.000Z	uLinux	iceroot	yea that shows i386
