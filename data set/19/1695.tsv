2010-10-29T15:37:00.000Z	dekker3d		Hey all, can I ask a bit of a noobish question about unstable packages here?
2010-10-29T15:37:00.000Z	dekker3d		Ubuntu.. I guess.
2010-10-29T15:38:00.000Z	dekker3d		That's why it's a noobish question. I have no idea how to use unstable packages, but I want to just get the latest Blender and Ogre from my package manager
2010-10-29T15:38:00.000Z	dekker3d		Not the versions about half a year old
2010-10-29T15:38:00.000Z	dekker3d		Can you people help me set that up?
2010-10-29T15:39:00.000Z	dekker3d		True, true. But it's a matter of comfort. Besides, it'd be nice if my blender was automatically kept up to date too
2010-10-29T15:40:00.000Z	dekker3d		True, true. I already have a version installed manually. The thing is, there must be a better way, right?
2010-10-29T15:41:00.000Z	dekker3d		Linux users always tell me it's much more user-friendly and simply better in almost every way than Windows
2010-10-29T15:42:00.000Z	dekker3d		Ah, ppa is shorthand for a repository of sorts?
2010-10-29T15:43:00.000Z	dekker3d		I've found something that looks like a ppa. "ppa:cheleb/blender-svn". Now... indulge the noob: what do I do with this? :P
2010-10-29T15:44:00.000Z	Onyx47	dekker3d	sudo apt-add ppa:cheleb/blender-svn I belive, if I remember the syntax correctly, alternatively you can add it as a repository through synaptic or manualy put it into /etc/apt/sources.list
2010-10-29T15:49:00.000Z	dekker3d	Onyx47	I can't find apt-add, by the way..
2010-10-29T15:49:00.000Z	dekker3d	Onyx47	Maybe apt-add-repository?
2010-10-29T15:49:00.000Z	Onyx47	dekker3d	yeah, that's the one
2010-10-29T15:50:00.000Z	dekker3d	Onyx47	And then I apt-get update?
2010-10-29T15:51:00.000Z	Onyx47	dekker3d	yes
2010-10-29T16:07:00.000Z	Onyx47	dekker3d	there is a way but not with vanilla Ubuntu kernel. you'll either need to recompile the kernel or use server kernel which has that support built-in (at least it should have)
2010-10-29T16:08:00.000Z	dekker3d	Onyx47	Would you recommend I copypasta some stuff into a terminal and upgrade, or  just reinstall to 64 bit?
2010-10-29T16:10:00.000Z	Onyx47	dekker3d	system - administration - startup disk creator ;-)
