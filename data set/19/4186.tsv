2009-03-12T05:58:00.000Z	BornSlippy	g0nad	yay :D

2009-03-12T06:02:00.000Z	BornSlippy	g0nad	yes I was looking at that one, my brain started melting after the first paragraph.. I'll try again
2009-03-12T06:03:00.000Z	g0nad	BornSlippy	what are you trying to do?  boot without gui?
2009-03-12T06:05:00.000Z	BornSlippy	g0nad	no, my keyboard and mouse freeze after x amount of use, and I'm trying to figure out a solution. I found one place that suggested I could change the gdm runlevel to 25 and it might solve the problem. I have no idea why, but I don't have any better ideas.
2009-03-12T06:06:00.000Z	g0nad	BornSlippy	do you have a link to that post?
2009-03-12T06:07:00.000Z	BornSlippy	g0nad	looking for it now, one second. .. it was in launchpad somewhere
2009-03-12T06:07:00.000Z	g0nad	BornSlippy	ok
2009-03-12T06:08:00.000Z	BornSlippy	g0nad	this is similar https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/intrepid/+source/gdm/+bug/271138
2009-03-12T06:08:00.000Z	g0nad	BornSlippy	ok, im going to look @ it now
2009-03-12T06:10:00.000Z	BornSlippy	g0nad	thanks. The gdm thing I think is if the keyboard and mouse freezes at login though. That's not the case for me. I tried poking around with xorg but I didn't really get anywhere. I tried reinstalling it but couldn't, it just said "already updated"

2009-03-12T06:22:00.000Z	BornSlippy	g0nad	tritium: my keyboard and mouse freeze apparently randomly after I use Intrepid for a while. I just provoked the error now and I'm trying ctrl alt F1 and backend to no avail
