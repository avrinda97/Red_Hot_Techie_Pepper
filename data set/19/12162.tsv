2005-11-20T08:42:00.000Z	jedrick		anyone who plays xmame here, i have problem with the sounds
2005-11-20T08:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jedrick	 may be more of an alsa/oss issue then a mame issue.
2005-11-20T08:42:00.000Z	jedrick	Dr_Willis	then what will i do?
2005-11-20T08:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jedrick	 well is it a problem with all games or just 1 ?  mame has dozens of command line options also. and the config files have even more.
2005-11-20T08:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jedrick	 whats 'wrong' with the sounds?
2005-11-20T08:45:00.000Z	jedrick	Dr_Willis	it's too low
2005-11-20T08:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jedrick	 youmean the volume or the pitch?
2005-11-20T08:46:00.000Z	jedrick	Dr_Willis	i dunno but i almost can't here anything
2005-11-20T08:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jedrick	 other progams/game got ok sound?
2005-11-20T08:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jedrick	 sounds like its not a mame issue then.
2005-11-20T08:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jedrick	 check the wiki's and google for yoru specific brand sound card perhaps - and find some info
2005-11-20T08:48:00.000Z	jedrick	Dr_Willis	 my sound card is fine, maybe this would do something on the configuration.. where can i find the configuration for the sound
2005-11-20T08:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jedrick	 if you got the sliders all the way up and no volume.. sounds to me like its not fine. :P
2005-11-20T08:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jedrick	 the alsa sound system can be a little  complex.    could install some of the Other alsa-mixers and twiddle with them.
2005-11-20T08:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jedrick	 could be the default volume control slider is not controlling the right mixer channel.
2005-11-20T08:50:00.000Z	jedrick	Dr_Willis	where will i fix it then?
2005-11-20T08:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jedrick	  install some of the Other alsa-mixers and twiddle with them.
2005-11-20T08:51:00.000Z	jedrick	Dr_Willis	how?,, im just new to linux :)
2005-11-20T08:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jedrick	 fire up synaptic. search for the other soundmixer tools and install them
