2009-03-23T23:04:00.000Z	saxs		Hi all. I need some help I have some problems with unresolved package dependencies using synaptic. I intalled WINE time ago and unistalled it. When I wanted to install the last version again through Add remove programs or using synaptic it gives me an error of ï»¿unresolved package dependencies. I investigated in the Net and nothing. I only found a dependency with the package binfmt-support and I have a lower version installed in my h
2009-03-23T23:05:00.000Z	sebsebseb	saxs	ok first of all  to make sure you always got the latest wine add the  Ubuntu repo from winehq.  http://www.winehq.org
2009-03-23T23:05:00.000Z	sebsebseb	saxs	I don't see the need to private about your issue,  this channel is not that busy at the moment
2009-03-23T23:05:00.000Z	sebsebseb	saxs	Debian hummmmmm you want the Ubuntu version
2009-03-23T23:06:00.000Z	sebsebseb	saxs	you are on Ubuntu, not Debian right?
2009-03-23T23:06:00.000Z	sebsebseb	saxs	yes  add the winehq repo for  Wine, and then sudo apt-get install it.  make sure your other wine is gone. sudo apt-get purge wine  will do that
2009-03-23T23:06:00.000Z	sebsebseb	saxs	and it would leave the .wine folder probably as a hidden folder in home.
2009-03-23T23:06:00.000Z	sebsebseb	saxs	 by the sounds of it also your package manager is broken?
2009-03-23T23:07:00.000Z	sebsebseb	saxs	also what kind of stuff do you want to run in Wine?  you should use  native Linux programs most/all of the time :)
2009-03-23T23:09:00.000Z	sebsebseb	saxs	you can't have Synaptic or the cut down version add/remove open at the same time, that your trying to install stuff from the terminal
2009-03-23T23:09:00.000Z	sebsebseb	saxs	the GUI stuff is just a GUI for apt-get
2009-03-23T23:11:00.000Z	sebsebseb	saxs	yeah thought so, as a result you probably don't reolize  that Desktop Linux wasn't meant to be like  Windows in the first place,  because they are an alternative to Unix.   also this kind of software is about freedom,  source code being availalbe to the general public, so that programmers from all over the world can make the programs better.   know about this stuff no?
2009-03-23T23:11:00.000Z	sebsebseb	saxs	also ideally you should run programs that were made for  Linux, but sometimes there  may not be something good enough, and so yeah Wine
2009-03-23T23:12:00.000Z	sebsebseb	saxs	ok  try installing anything from the terminal.  and pastebin the output
2009-03-23T23:13:00.000Z	sebsebseb	saxs	and  you didn't ask for it, but if you see above,  I started trying to educate you a tiny bit in what  Desktop Linux is about,  so you don't  start trying to run loads of Windows programs in Wine :D.   and nah I triggered the bot to put that
2009-03-23T23:14:00.000Z	sebsebseb	saxs	if people  are going to use this kind of software, then ideally they should have a general idea, about what this kind of software is about,
2009-03-23T23:18:00.000Z	sebsebseb	saxs	you still haven't pastebinned the output of the terminal
2009-03-23T23:59:00.000Z	sebsebseb	saxs	your not meant to talk Spannish in here though
2009-03-23T23:59:00.000Z	sebsebseb	saxs	ok go pm with that guy and he can probably help you,  I think he probably knows Ubuntu resoanblly well, since I seen him  do stuff with other people before
