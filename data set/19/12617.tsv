2005-08-02T12:23:00.000Z	IceDC571	m0unds	usb microphones on linux ... for me is a nightmare
2005-08-02T12:24:00.000Z	m0unds	IceDC571	have you gotten one to work, or is it an ongoing sort of thing for you too?
2005-08-02T12:24:00.000Z	IceDC571	m0unds	i got really frustrated and ripped it out... sorry, thats just my experience :)
