2010-06-07T06:12:00.000Z	Knick-RDP		trying now edbian - though its fetching linux-headers now
2010-06-07T06:12:00.000Z	Knick-RDP		kernel updates i assume
2010-06-07T06:12:00.000Z	Knick-RDP		while doing that i get those errors again
2010-06-07T06:13:00.000Z	Knick-RDP		i think something in dpkg might be messed up since i did that
2010-06-07T06:13:00.000Z	Knick-RDP		let me try that when it finishes, edbian
2010-06-07T06:13:00.000Z	Knick-RDP		Package snort is not installed, so not removed
2010-06-07T06:14:00.000Z	Knick-RDP		not fixed - i even tried aptitude reinstall dpkg..
2010-06-07T06:15:00.000Z	Knick-RDP		done several times
2010-06-07T06:16:00.000Z	Knick-RDP		weird thing is though edbian that at this point no .deb files are there anymore
2010-06-07T06:16:00.000Z	Knick-RDP		while earlier it was a huge list
2010-06-07T06:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Knick-RDP	you can use: sudo apt-get autoclean   and it will clean itself
2010-06-07T06:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Knick-RDP	can you give a pastebin of: sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get upgrade; sudo apt-get --reinstall install gedit
2010-06-07T06:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Knick-RDP	oh you use kde, you just hauled in a few gnome apps
2010-06-07T06:28:00.000Z	Knick-RDP	ActionParsnip	i dont use kde - its ubuntu server edition
2010-06-07T06:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Knick-RDP	i see, looks like snort is having some issues. I'd reinstall snort to then uninstall it if you dont need it, i'd also remove all that stuff you just pulled down as its surplus to requirements
2010-06-07T06:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Knick-RDP	i'd reinstall the packages named, then remove them
2010-06-07T06:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Knick-RDP	all i can suggest is reinstall the snort packages named, then remove
2010-06-07T06:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Knick-RDP	you can mess with the postrm files to rip it out: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/flashplugin-nonfree/+bug/582160
2010-06-07T06:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Knick-RDP	make sure you backup the files before you play
