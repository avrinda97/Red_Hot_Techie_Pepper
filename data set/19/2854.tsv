2011-06-25T12:17:00.000Z	bsmith093		it seems that everything i try to download that inst just a normal browser window type download, is EXTREMELY slow. i have roadrunne, and normally get around 1.2mbps down 360kbps up, but with these special case downloads im getting 10k max. any solutions?
2011-06-25T12:18:00.000Z	bsmith093		pretty much anything except manually downloading something from a browser
2011-06-25T12:19:00.000Z	Apple_Cat	bsmith093	What kind of downloads? Like what protocol are you having problems with?
2011-06-25T12:20:00.000Z	Apple_Cat	bsmith093	Could it be a problem with gpodder?
2011-06-25T12:24:00.000Z	Apple_Cat	bsmith093	So there is a bug reporting the same problem you are having? If that's what it is, and it was fixed maybe you don't have the newest version
2011-06-25T12:25:00.000Z	Apple_Cat	bsmith093	Have you ever had downloading in gpodder going as fast as it should? Are there any other problems with different programs?
2011-06-25T12:26:00.000Z	Apple_Cat	bsmith093	Are you on wireless... Any significant packet loss?
2011-06-25T12:27:00.000Z	Apple_Cat	bsmith093	Open a terminal and type 'mtr www.google.com'
2011-06-25T12:28:00.000Z	Apple_Cat	bsmith093	Yeah you're right, it shouldn't make a difference but I'd check anyway. It sounds like there is just a bug in gpodder, which you could always report
2011-06-25T12:29:00.000Z	Apple_Cat	bsmith093	Well... If gpodder is the *only* app that isn't downloading at full speed
2011-06-25T12:29:00.000Z	Apple_Cat	bsmith093	It ends when you want it to, the important thing is to check the Loss% column
2011-06-25T12:30:00.000Z	Apple_Cat	bsmith093	press q to quit
2011-06-25T12:32:00.000Z	bsmith093	Apple_Cat	cable-mac1.irndnyaf-ar4002.nyroc was 27.5% loss, but now its down to 4.7
2011-06-25T12:35:00.000Z	bsmith093	Apple_Cat	any other advice?
2011-06-25T12:37:00.000Z	Apple_Cat	bsmith093	Can I just check everything again? So all other programs (and protocols) seem to work fine (as far as you know) but gpodder has a slow download speed. I am assuming that gpodder doesn't require any special ports to be forwarded, so it seems gpodder is the problem (so report a bug :). You are on wireless and are having no packet loss
2011-06-25T12:38:00.000Z	bsmith093	Apple_Cat	yes
2011-06-25T12:38:00.000Z	Apple_Cat	bsmith093	Ok well there's your question answered, I'm sorry the problem isn't fixed though.
2011-06-25T12:39:00.000Z	Apple_Cat	bsmith093	None that you are aware of, or none at all?
2011-06-25T12:41:00.000Z	Apple_Cat	bsmith093	Tried reinstalling gpodder?
