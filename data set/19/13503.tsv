2007-01-13T11:20:00.000Z	Laughing_Cheese		that's my main drive
2007-01-13T11:20:00.000Z	Laughing_Cheese		and then one that's about 55GB
2007-01-13T11:20:00.000Z	Laughing_Cheese		and that's the one I want to put Ubuntu on
2007-01-13T11:20:00.000Z	Laughing_Cheese		cool
2007-01-13T11:20:00.000Z	Laughing_Cheese		I know,
2007-01-13T11:21:00.000Z	Laughing_Cheese		but I read the dual boot installation guide on the wiki,
2007-01-13T11:21:00.000Z	Laughing_Cheese		they recommended 20-30GB?
2007-01-13T11:22:00.000Z	Laughing_Cheese		and 500MB swap partition?
2007-01-13T11:22:00.000Z	Laughing_Cheese		the official one...
2007-01-13T11:23:00.000Z	Laughing_Cheese		let me see if I can find it, hold on...
2007-01-13T11:23:00.000Z	cafuego_	Laughing_Cheese	You need a minimum of 3 GB as /. If you want to store stuff as user, add space. if you want some space to add more applications, give / more.
2007-01-13T11:23:00.000Z	cafuego_	Laughing_Cheese	I tend to end up doing a 4GB / with a minimum 10GB /home and in between 256 and 512Mb swap.
2007-01-13T11:24:00.000Z	cafuego_	Laughing_Cheese	Nope, prime numbers are fine too.
2007-01-13T11:25:00.000Z	cafuego_	Laughing_Cheese	1 is fine, but not very useful <heh>
2007-01-13T11:27:00.000Z	cafuego_	Laughing_Cheese	<heh>
2007-01-13T11:27:00.000Z	cafuego_	Laughing_Cheese	Look, if you're not happy with the way you've partitioned, you can always change it.
2007-01-13T11:28:00.000Z	cafuego_	Laughing_Cheese	the only real way to find out what's best is to just do it and learn :-)
2007-01-13T11:29:00.000Z	cafuego_	Laughing_Cheese	WHy not? If you don't like it, wipe it and try again :-)
2007-01-13T11:31:00.000Z	cafuego_	Laughing_Cheese	No, if you want to dual boot I suggest doing a manula partition.
