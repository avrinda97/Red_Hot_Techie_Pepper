2005-09-28T16:19:00.000Z	elad`		What's Totem?
2005-09-28T16:19:00.000Z	elad`		I double clicked an mp3 file, and it gave me an error, said it was already busy or something.
2005-09-28T16:20:00.000Z	elad`		Then I right clicked it and chose "open with media player", and it ran Rythmibox or something, which told me no plugin is installed for dealing with mp3 files.
2005-09-28T16:20:00.000Z	WebLOCH	elad`	mp3s are not a free format
2005-09-28T16:21:00.000Z	WebLOCH	elad`	they are referred to as a restricted format, you can find out how to install them by checking out https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats
2005-09-28T06:27:00.000Z	WebLOCH	elad`	unless you use IDENT you will hang for awhile
2005-09-28T06:27:00.000Z	WebLOCH	elad`	you would need to install an IDENTd
2005-09-28T06:28:00.000Z	WebLOCH	elad`	it wouldnt be worth the effort, just wait the couple of seconds
2005-09-28T06:29:00.000Z	WebLOCH	elad`	google it
2005-09-28T06:32:00.000Z	WebLOCH	elad`	 maybe it was the wrong software, maybe its not running, maybe its not configured and maybe its not the problem at all
2005-09-28T06:32:00.000Z	WebLOCH	elad`	just google "LINUX IDENT" and learn how to use it properly that might yield the answer
2005-09-28T07:05:00.000Z	WebLOCH	elad`	thats the nature of GAIM, MSN and the interconnecting of the networks and protocols,
2005-09-28T07:06:00.000Z	elad`	WebLOCH	but someone else, using GAIM, was able to send me a file.
2005-09-28T07:06:00.000Z	WebLOCH	elad`	yeah thats my point, its not stable and its not predictable
2005-09-28T07:06:00.000Z	WebLOCH	elad`	my ex-housemate i cant send to or receive from, i dont have problems with anyone else, nor does he
2005-09-28T07:07:00.000Z	WebLOCH	elad`	well why don't you fix it then.
2005-09-28T07:08:00.000Z	elad`	WebLOCH	give me 90 minutes though, as I want to have lunch first.
2005-09-28T07:08:00.000Z	WebLOCH	elad`	no problem hearty last meal and all that
2005-09-28T07:13:00.000Z	elad`	WebLOCH	OK, I've solved the problem, you can send files to your ex-housemate now.
