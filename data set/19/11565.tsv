2006-10-16T09:48:00.000Z	rex		so, I take it from the silence on the subject that I've exceeded this channel's hel caabilities
2006-10-16T09:49:00.000Z	krazykit	rex	or we don't know your keymap.  i have several letters between them
2006-10-16T09:50:00.000Z	krazykit	rex	so the p?
2006-10-16T09:51:00.000Z	krazykit	rex	have a liveCD?  if so, pop it in.  if the p-key works, it's fixable.  if not, you're gonna want to buy a new keyboard
2006-10-16T09:52:00.000Z	krazykit	rex	so multiple keyboards fail to print "p"?
2006-10-16T09:52:00.000Z	krazykit	rex	ah, now we're getting somewhere.  open a terminal and type xev.  put the cursor over the xev window and hit "p"  see if it spews any output
2006-10-16T09:53:00.000Z	krazykit	rex	not the question.  open xev and see if pressing "P" gives any output
2006-10-16T09:54:00.000Z	krazykit	rex	did you open xev and try?  you're not answering the question.
2006-10-16T09:58:00.000Z	krazykit	rex	don't spam the channel
2006-10-16T09:59:00.000Z	krazykit	rex	ok, so there'y no symbol for it.  this should not be a hard fix, as soon as i figure out the command ;-)
2006-10-16T10:03:00.000Z	krazykit	rex	ok, i got it.  paste this into your terminal:  xmodmap -e "keycode 33= p"
2006-10-16T10:04:00.000Z	krazykit	rex	dunno.  something nuked that keysym for some reason.  remember tha command and xev, and you can remap anything
