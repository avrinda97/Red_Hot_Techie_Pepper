2006-11-10T10:13:00.000Z	Zambezi		Will there be difference in CPU-load and memory using Ubuntu Dapper server compare to Debian Sarge server? Both without X. The computer will work as a Jabberserver and Spamassassin.
2006-11-10T10:14:00.000Z	Xenguy	Zambezi	I would use Debian stable, but that's just me
2006-11-10T10:15:00.000Z	Zambezi	Xenguy	How about the securiy?
2006-11-10T10:15:00.000Z	Xenguy	Zambezi	debian stable is a truly stable server platform; security is excellent
2006-11-10T10:16:00.000Z	Zambezi	Xenguy	And all the commands are the same in Debian like apt-get update, ssh user@ip -p port? And hosts.allow, hosts.deny is also easily found?
2006-11-10T10:17:00.000Z	Xenguy	Zambezi	debian came first :-)
2006-11-10T10:17:00.000Z	Xenguy	Zambezi	yes
2006-11-10T10:18:00.000Z	Zambezi	Xenguy	I give it a shoot.
2006-11-10T10:18:00.000Z	Xenguy	Zambezi	let us know how things go (or see you in #debian :-)
2006-11-10T10:19:00.000Z	Zambezi	Xenguy	I'm in the channel right now too. I'll give it a shoot if I can find the image I'm looking for.
2006-11-10T10:19:00.000Z	Xenguy	Zambezi	cheers (I'm off to bed :-)
2006-11-24T09:11:00.000Z	Xenguy	Zambezi	oh stop your witch hunt and political correctness
2006-11-24T09:12:00.000Z	Zambezi	Xenguy	I can translate it later. He'll be banned in Swedish channel later.
2006-11-24T09:12:00.000Z	Xenguy	Zambezi	I'm just personally tired of censors and lawyers :P
2006-11-24T09:14:00.000Z	Zambezi	Xenguy	Okay, but this guy really deseves it. ;-) He bullied me and was rude to all the other in the channel.
2006-11-24T09:14:00.000Z	Xenguy	Zambezi	I'm going to bite my tongue (hard) now -- excuse me :p
2006-11-24T09:16:00.000Z	Xenguy	Zambezi	this may work to /ignore replies too: ignore -replies -time 1800
2006-11-24T09:16:00.000Z	Xenguy	Zambezi	this may work to /ignore replies too: /ignore -replies -time 1800
2006-11-24T09:18:00.000Z	Zambezi	Xenguy	I save the commands. But it became personal, so I'll ignore him here and get him banned in the Swedish channel. :-)
