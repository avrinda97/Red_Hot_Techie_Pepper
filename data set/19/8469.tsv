2007-04-15T13:05:00.000Z	`Matir		Is it possible for memtest86+ to not find any errors in memory, and yet the memory still be bad?
2007-04-15T13:06:00.000Z	chowmeined	`Matir	if they are in the first few KB that memtest86+ uses.. but it would probably segfault if it was
2007-04-15T13:07:00.000Z	`Matir	chowmeined	ahh.. i have a computer that won't even load the livecd (kernel oops).  It occasionally freezes during bios memory check as well
2007-04-15T13:07:00.000Z	chowmeined	`Matir	does it always segfault in the same place?
2007-04-15T13:08:00.000Z	chowmeined	`Matir	i mean oops.. does it always kernel oops in the same place?
2007-04-15T13:09:00.000Z	chowmeined	`Matir	have you tried memtest86 vs memtest86+?
2007-04-15T13:09:00.000Z	`Matir	chowmeined	yes, both complete a full pass with no errors
2007-04-15T13:09:00.000Z	chowmeined	`Matir	have you used any other OS on this machine? and does it work?
2007-04-15T13:09:00.000Z	`Matir	chowmeined	it used to have WinXP on it, which worked, but occasionally locked up (but that could just be windows)
2007-04-15T13:10:00.000Z	chowmeined	`Matir	is it overheating? what do the temp sensors say in the BIOS?
2007-04-15T13:10:00.000Z	`Matir	chowmeined	they show 41 deg. C
2007-04-15T13:10:00.000Z	chowmeined	`Matir	do you have any spare compatible RAM you can put in just to test?
2007-04-15T13:11:00.000Z	`Matir	chowmeined	I have another system I could temporarily take down and pull the RAM from... I'll try that now
2007-04-15T13:12:00.000Z	chowmeined	`Matir	or if it has two sticks of ram.. take the one from the second slot and put it in the first
2007-04-15T13:12:00.000Z	`Matir	chowmeined	that I've tried.. the system won't even POST with just stick2 in the first slot
2007-04-15T13:13:00.000Z	chowmeined	`Matir	and with just stick 1?
2007-04-15T13:13:00.000Z	`Matir	chowmeined	same behavior as with both 1 and 2
2007-04-15T13:14:00.000Z	chowmeined	`Matir	it just freezes sometimes and kernel oopses? .. if you have a spare computer you could try putting stick1 in slot2 of that other computer.. and then running memtest
2007-04-15T13:15:00.000Z	`Matir	chowmeined	i'll try swapping the ram into this one first and see if it improves and then try that
