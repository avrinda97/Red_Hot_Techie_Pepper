2009-06-22T09:50:00.000Z	thomast		Trying to get my mic to work - found some forum posts re: alsamixer, but not seeing how to ensure that a capture source is turned on for capture
2009-06-22T09:51:00.000Z	thomast		In alsa mixer, I have three capture sources - docking mic, External mic, and internal mic.
2009-06-22T09:52:00.000Z	thomast		I have all turned up to 100, but still no dice with Sound Recorder or Skype
2009-06-22T09:53:00.000Z	samtihen	thomast	its a huge pain in the ass, because it seems like each computer gets slightly different options
2009-06-22T09:54:00.000Z	samtihen	thomast	and random things get set to mute at random
2009-06-22T09:54:00.000Z	thomast	samtihen	- pointers of where to start? Jaunty on an HP laptop, with NVidia audio.
2009-06-22T09:55:00.000Z	samtihen	thomast	first, open up both Sound Preferences and Volume Control
2009-06-22T09:55:00.000Z	samtihen	thomast	now, in volume control, go to preferences and set all tracks to be visible
2009-06-22T09:56:00.000Z	samtihen		this should result in a bunch of tabs being open
2009-06-22T09:57:00.000Z	samtihen	thomast	now, on the playback tab, set master volume to whatever you want, set PCM to 100%, and set ALL the other mics, boosts, and beeps to mute or 0 volume
2009-06-22T09:58:00.000Z	thomast	samtihen	- I only have Master channel in Vol Ctrl prefs
2009-06-22T09:59:00.000Z	samtihen	thomast	that sucks, and is exactly what im talking about
2009-06-22T10:00:00.000Z	samtihen	thomast	everyone gets random options
2009-06-22T10:00:00.000Z	samtihen		ill make a quick screencast
2009-06-22T10:00:00.000Z	thomast	samtihen	- wait - under Device, if I change it, I get more playback options
2009-06-22T10:04:00.000Z	samtihen	thomast	this needs a minute or 2 to finish uploadting, but it shows my working settings on a thinkpad t61... http://files.getdropbox.com/u/234638/screencast.ogv
2009-06-22T10:04:00.000Z	samtihen		k, its done
2009-06-22T10:04:00.000Z	thomast		thx, samtihen.
2009-06-22T10:11:00.000Z	thomast	samtihen	- If I'm missing options, does it mean I need diff drivers for my sound card?
