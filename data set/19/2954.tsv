2010-07-12T20:06:00.000Z	jacobian		yarg this is frustrating.   Is there some way to trick the upgrade-manager into telling me about a release?
2010-07-12T20:08:00.000Z	jacobian		I'm trying to go from 8.04 LTS -> 10.04 LTS
2010-07-12T20:08:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	jacobian	gksudo update manager -c
2010-07-12T20:10:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	jacobian	gksudo update-manager -c
2010-07-12T20:13:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	jacobian	did you run that in alt-f2?
2010-07-12T20:15:00.000Z	jacobian	aeon-ltd	yes
2010-07-12T20:15:00.000Z	jacobian	aeon-ltd	It returns immediately but doesn't appear to do anything
2010-07-12T20:16:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	jacobian	do it in a terminal but replace gksudo with sudo
2010-07-12T20:16:00.000Z	jacobian	aeon-ltd	It hangs, presumably, again, because of the firewall
2010-07-12T20:17:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	jacobian	does it find 8.10 through reg methods?
2010-07-12T20:17:00.000Z	jacobian	aeon-ltd	No
2010-07-12T20:19:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	jacobian	hpw much data you got on this machine?
2010-07-12T20:19:00.000Z	jacobian	aeon-ltd	switching between lts and normal has no effect
2010-07-12T20:19:00.000Z	jacobian	aeon-ltd	My dissertation and all my code :)
2010-07-12T20:20:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	jacobian	i think you may have to and copy /home for configs, then fresh install
2010-07-12T20:22:00.000Z	jacobian	aeon-ltd	Seems like I somehow fried the distro - not sure how though.
2010-07-12T20:24:00.000Z	jacobian	aeon-ltd	Will I have to install from CD/DVD then?
2010-07-12T20:24:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	jacobian	yeah pretty much
2010-07-12T20:51:00.000Z	jacobian	aeon-ltd	seems like the upgarde from alternate iso file is working.
