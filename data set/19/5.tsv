2004-09-07T14:55:00.000Z	ik5pvx		anyone else missing "tree" ?
2004-09-07T14:56:00.000Z	fabbione	ik5pvx	from main?
2004-09-07T15:17:00.000Z	fabbione	ik5pvx	it's exactly like the Debian kernel
2004-09-11T12:24:00.000Z	fabbione	ik5pvx	please file a bug
2004-09-11T13:19:00.000Z	fabbione	ik5pvx	i think the problem is related to USB only. all the otherstuff is a chain of things that goes banana
2004-09-11T13:36:00.000Z	ik5pvx	fabbione	yes I too think it's a chain reaction. It's strange that udev freezes too, and I couldn't complete the reboot.
2004-09-11T13:37:00.000Z	fabbione	ik5pvx	udev is full of race conditions afaict
2004-09-12T15:11:00.000Z	fabbione	ik5pvx	you around?
2004-09-12T15:17:00.000Z	ik5pvx	fabbione	more or less 
2004-09-12T15:17:00.000Z	fabbione	ik5pvx	ok.. can you use the step 3 config and fix it to see what needs to be changed?
2004-09-12T15:22:00.000Z	fabbione	ik5pvx	yes i read the log.
2004-09-12T15:22:00.000Z	fabbione	ik5pvx	screen not found is a consequence of the no matching mode
2004-09-12T15:26:00.000Z	fabbione	ik5pvx	i would like you to not change the driver
2004-09-12T05:35:00.000Z	ik5pvx	fabbione	need other tests with X? can I restore good config ?
2004-09-12T05:36:00.000Z	fabbione	ik5pvx	thanks.. just go ahead
2004-09-13T12:44:00.000Z	ik5pvx	fabbione	running an upgrade from aptitude right now, X asked me what about my video card... I have not reinstalled the autodetection tools since the tests of 2 days ago
2004-09-13T13:31:00.000Z	ik5pvx	fabbione	fwiw the config works as is
