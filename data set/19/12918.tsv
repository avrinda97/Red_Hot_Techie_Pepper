2006-08-07T12:37:00.000Z	erUSUL	ubuntu__	boot in recovery mode
2007-06-07T05:27:00.000Z	erUSUL	ubuntu__	just create an empty partition and let windows do the formatting
2007-06-07T05:40:00.000Z	erUSUL	ubuntu__	no, if you create a partiton (no empty space) then during the installing process of vista you can choose what partition you want to install it on (i assume)
2007-06-07T05:40:00.000Z	erUSUL	ubuntu__	but windows has allways wanted the first partition of the first drive to install on
2007-10-09T09:12:00.000Z	erUSUL	ubuntu__	for a ext3 partition?
2007-10-09T09:12:00.000Z	erUSUL	ubuntu__	mount -t ext3 /dev/xxxx /mount/point
2007-10-09T09:15:00.000Z	erUSUL	ubuntu__	in terminal
2007-10-09T09:18:00.000Z	erUSUL	ubuntu__	use "sudo -i" to get a "rooted shell"
2007-10-09T09:18:00.000Z	erUSUL	ubuntu__	in livecd you have a blank password iirci
