2011-12-04T03:13:00.000Z	Satyr_	ThinkT510	do you remember me
2011-12-04T03:13:00.000Z	Satyr_		I was here earlier and you gave me the link to install flash.
2011-12-04T03:13:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Satyr_	yes, i can't remember your problem though
2011-12-04T03:13:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Satyr_	oh
2011-12-04T03:13:00.000Z	Satyr_		I had an audio delay with flash
2011-12-04T03:13:00.000Z	Satyr_		It still exists with all three browsers
2011-12-04T03:14:00.000Z	Satyr_		I am using KX Studio to bypass pulse audio though
2011-12-04T03:14:00.000Z	Satyr_		However all of my other audio does not have a delay
2011-12-04T03:14:00.000Z	Satyr_		So is there a way to set up a latency for only flash audio?
2011-12-04T03:14:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Satyr_	i've never heard of kx studio. what is it for and how did you install it?
2011-12-04T03:15:00.000Z	Satyr_		One second let me give you links:
2011-12-04T03:15:00.000Z	Satyr_		http://kxstudio.sourceforge.net/Main_Page
2011-12-04T03:15:00.000Z	Satyr_		http://kxstudio.sourceforge.net/Help:Ubuntu:Upgrade
2011-12-04T03:15:00.000Z	Satyr_		I had a successful install, and everything other than the flash audio delay is working great
2011-12-04T03:16:00.000Z	Satyr_		It is a way to make it so that you can use Jack Audio instead of Pulse Audio
2011-12-04T03:16:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Satyr_	ah, so it is a ppa, i can't help you then sorry
2011-12-04T03:16:00.000Z	Satyr_		Can you tell me how to set up a latency just for Flash?
2011-12-04T03:17:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Satyr_	i wouldn't know how to sorry, my flash works like it should
