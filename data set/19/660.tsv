2011-10-26T11:30:00.000Z	s0nee	Nightwelf	im not using compiz. Im trying to replace the default running window manager with awesome
2011-10-26T11:30:00.000Z	Nightwelf	s0nee	i tell about 3D
2011-10-26T11:32:00.000Z	Nightwelf	s0nee	default ubuntu WM is not bad
2011-10-26T11:32:00.000Z	Nightwelf	s0nee	i think
2011-10-26T11:32:00.000Z	s0nee	Nightwelf	awesome is better to me
2011-10-26T11:36:00.000Z	Nightwelf	s0nee	i nener use it, use only awesome without gnome-shell, awesome like xmonad?
2011-10-26T11:36:00.000Z	s0nee	Nightwelf	it is
2011-10-26T11:37:00.000Z	Nightwelf	s0nee	i see article about xmonad + gnome
2011-10-26T11:39:00.000Z	s0nee	Nightwelf	i read that xmonad uses haskell and it is configured by modifying the source code and rebulding
2011-10-26T11:39:00.000Z	s0nee	Nightwelf	so i tried awesome instead. and its awesome
2011-10-26T11:42:00.000Z	Nightwelf	s0nee	i dont use it sorry :(
2011-10-26T11:45:00.000Z	s0nee	Nightwelf	the big question is how do i "kill" the default running window manager of gnome shell
2011-10-26T11:46:00.000Z	Nightwelf	s0nee	/usr/bin/OTHER_WM --replace does not works?
2011-10-26T11:46:00.000Z	s0nee	Nightwelf	awesome does not have a --replace option
2011-10-26T11:47:00.000Z	Nightwelf	s0nee	no ideas
2011-10-26T11:48:00.000Z	s0nee	Nightwelf	so i replaced with metacity then terminate it. now no window manager is running. and i run awesome :)
2011-10-26T11:49:00.000Z	Nightwelf	s0nee	:)
2011-10-26T11:51:00.000Z	s0nee	Nightwelf	because that method requires me to terminate metacity manually, i can't write a script to do that. that's why i try to kill gnome shell window manager instead
