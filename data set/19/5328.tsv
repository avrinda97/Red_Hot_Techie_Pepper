2008-07-22T00:36:00.000Z	genii	Chadd	Is the partition currently more than half-full of data before you are trying to cut it in half?
2008-07-22T00:36:00.000Z	Chadd	genii	no it isn't
2008-07-22T00:36:00.000Z	Chadd		genni, i have a 160 gb hard drive

2008-07-22T00:37:00.000Z	genii	Chadd	Is it a Windows ntfs partition that has not had CHKDSK run on it recently?
2008-07-22T00:37:00.000Z	Chadd		genni, and yes i defragmented
2008-07-22T00:37:00.000Z	Chadd		genni, chkdsk? what is that?
2008-07-22T00:38:00.000Z	genii	Chadd	chkdsk is the utility inside windows which scans the drive and makes sure there are no errors on it. If the disk is not marked clean by Windows, then gparted will refuse to do anything to it.
2008-07-22T00:38:00.000Z	Chadd	genii	oh ahh ok that may just fix it, how do i use the command?
2008-07-22T00:39:00.000Z	Chadd		genni, ok well i went on wiki pedia executed the command it's not scanning
2008-07-22T00:40:00.000Z	Chadd		genni, thanks alot nobody yesterday seemed to know the problem!
2008-07-22T00:40:00.000Z	genii	Chadd	From inside Windows, go to Run    then put cmd   as the command. When it opens up text box:  chkdsk C: /F          It will ask to do it next boot. Select yes. Then reboot it and let it complete scan.
