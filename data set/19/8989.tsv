2007-01-09T16:25:00.000Z	Enlight_uni	phr34ck	Yup I understood, but it worgs not only while playing games
2007-01-09T16:27:00.000Z	Enlight_uni	phr34ck	well saving your eyes is worth the extra money I guess
2007-01-09T16:27:00.000Z	phr34ck	Enlight_uni	your argument is totally flawed. It's not like VGA is the extremly messed it. It's more then comfortable.
2007-01-09T16:28:00.000Z	Enlight_uni	phr34ck	I tend to feel tired faster with VGA output
