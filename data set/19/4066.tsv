2009-05-22T00:12:00.000Z	zek		why did 9.04 disable ctrl alt backspace ??
2009-05-22T00:13:00.000Z	zek		why didnt they map it to ctrl alt delete so its similar to windows,  or make it a four key combo
2009-05-22T00:14:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	zek	Now you know how to enable it on.  Not too hard, is it? :)
2009-05-22T00:17:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	zek	I liked Gnome-Mplayer
2009-05-22T00:17:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	zek	Not same as Mplayer.  Just a different (simpler) front-end.
2009-05-22T00:18:00.000Z	zek	mobi-sheep	does that have better playback than vlc.  cause vlc is nice for playing anything but it doesnt play some stuff real well
2009-05-22T00:19:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	zek	We all have our own problems.  Your problem is different than mine.  I don't have problems running MKV or AVI.  Our hardwares factors in that too.  We even run different video files / formats. :) :
2009-05-22T00:20:00.000Z	zek	mobi-sheep	 but it seems like the people at vlc could fix it.
2009-05-22T00:20:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	zek	I'm using VLC Alpha 1.0 to resolve the embedded window issue.  You might want to try that.
2009-05-22T00:21:00.000Z	zek	mobi-sheep	 embedded window issue??
2009-05-22T00:22:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	zek	The result of having two UI interfaces when running a single instance of VLC -- One for Control interface and one for video output.
2009-05-22T00:23:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	zek	It's a bug and certainly annoying one. :(
2009-05-22T00:24:00.000Z	zek	mobi-sheep	ok. cool
2009-05-22T00:24:00.000Z	zek	mobi-sheep	that you found a fix,  not that there is a bug
2009-05-22T00:24:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	zek	When you run vlc, do you get this --> http://www.raiden.net/images/articles/linux_media_players/vlc.png --> Or you get two windows?
2009-05-22T00:25:00.000Z	zek	mobi-sheep	 i get that on my windows side.  but i changed some settings on the ubuntu vlc and its 2 windows
2009-05-22T00:25:00.000Z	zek	mobi-sheep	 im going to get around to changing it back sometime
2009-05-22T00:25:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	zek	Yes.  If you could call that a fix by suppressing the old version.
2009-05-22T00:25:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	zek	Actually, that's a bug you got there.  Everybody got it. :)
