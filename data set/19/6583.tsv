2009-11-08T19:31:00.000Z	messiah		i don't have any ethernet card, just pci wireless; i tryed to set a static ip in manual in IPv4 but it didn't allow me to click apply; then i went to the interfaces file and i only had two lines "auto lo; iface lo inet loopback" (in ifconfig it says 3 interfaces, lo (i don't know what is this), wlan0, wmaster0)
2009-11-08T19:32:00.000Z	Bodsda	messiah	try this command    ifconfig wlan0 192.168.0.wathever
2009-11-08T19:33:00.000Z	messiah	Bodsda	is that to set a static IP or for what? now i have set as after install xubuntu, dinamic i guess
2009-11-08T19:33:00.000Z	messiah	Bodsda	for sure not the one i set yesterday
2009-11-08T19:33:00.000Z	Bodsda	messiah	yes, that will set that interface to use the specified ip address
2009-11-08T19:33:00.000Z	messiah	Bodsda	i deleted what i wrote in interfaces, i must write it again? and then write that?
2009-11-08T19:34:00.000Z	Bodsda	messiah	no, you shouldnt have to do anything to the interfaces file
2009-11-08T19:34:00.000Z	messiah	Bodsda	so... ifconfig wlan0 192.168.0.the number i want to static and it will be made????
2009-11-08T19:35:00.000Z	Bodsda	messiah	that will set your IP address for that interface, correct
2009-11-08T20:10:00.000Z	messiah	Bodsda	what you told me doesn't work; after write what you told me i didn't have internet, and now i re-boot and i have different IP, also my resolution become worse and i don't know why
2009-11-08T20:11:00.000Z	messiah	Bodsda	(and i can't change for better resolution, this is the maximum now, 800x600 ¬¬)
2009-11-08T20:11:00.000Z	Bodsda	messiah	well, dont blame me if your resolution got borked. I just told you how to change your IP address
2009-11-08T20:12:00.000Z	messiah	Bodsda	i didn't blame you
2009-11-08T20:12:00.000Z	messiah	Bodsda	just i tell you what happened
2009-11-08T20:12:00.000Z	Bodsda	messiah	Ok, I am not sure about your res. But the IP address should have changed. run   ifconfig to find out
2009-11-08T20:13:00.000Z	messiah	Bodsda	i did it and it is different one which i set
2009-11-08T20:13:00.000Z	Bodsda	messiah	hmm, perhaps open up the properties through network-manager and see if you can disable dhcp there
2009-11-08T20:14:00.000Z	messiah	Bodsda	what do you mean network-manager? where is that? i tryed in the top-right Edition, IPv4 manual, but it didn't allow me to click APPLY
2009-11-08T20:18:00.000Z	Bodsda	messiah	sounds like you need to run as root
