2005-04-18T06:44:00.000Z	uphu		In the ubuntu installer I get to the point where it asks for the resolution stuff.  i know this is a stupid question but what do I do?!
2005-04-18T06:45:00.000Z	uphu		Do I check off the one's my monitor can handle? or the one's it can't?
2005-04-18T06:45:00.000Z	uphu		I did that
2005-04-18T06:45:00.000Z	uphu		but then it won't display it
2005-04-18T06:46:00.000Z	uphu		Well my monitor can do 1280 x 1024.  It can do 1024 x 768 but when I do that... and it boots... the screen is all multicolored
2005-04-18T06:47:00.000Z	uphu		you talking to me?
2005-04-18T06:48:00.000Z	uphu		I mean the multicolors looks like it's displaying something which it can't handle
2005-04-18T06:48:00.000Z	uphu		but normally my monitor prints "out of bounds" if it is
2005-04-18T06:50:00.000Z	uphu		question: I finished installing the distro but there is nothing on the screen when I boot.
2005-04-18T06:51:00.000Z	zenrox	uphu	try doing a alt+ctrl+f1-6
2005-04-18T06:52:00.000Z	uphu	zenrox	uphu try doing a alt+ctrl+f1-6:  Are you kidding or being serious?
2005-04-18T06:52:00.000Z	uphu		I never heard of that combo
2005-04-18T06:53:00.000Z	zenrox	uphu	that will get you to a console login so you can fix drivers for your vidcard
2005-04-18T06:53:00.000Z	uphu		Oh!!
2005-04-18T06:53:00.000Z	uphu		That might be it!
2005-04-18T06:53:00.000Z	uphu		See, it's plugged into my video card right now
2005-04-18T06:53:00.000Z	uphu		maybe if I plug it into my mobo
2005-04-18T06:53:00.000Z	uphu		I dunno
2005-04-18T06:54:00.000Z	zenrox	uphu	 is it a nvidia card
