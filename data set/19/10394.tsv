2008-12-08T20:28:00.000Z	kdogg		anyone know a way around thet?
2008-12-08T20:28:00.000Z	kdogg		that*
2008-12-08T20:28:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	kdogg	not if you are running nvidia..
2008-12-08T20:29:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	kdogg	yes
2008-12-08T20:29:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	kdogg	I think you can use twinview, but you can ask in #compiz
2008-12-08T20:30:00.000Z	kdogg	Jack_Sparrow	any recommendations on a good but not expensive ati card?
2008-12-08T20:30:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	kdogg	See the people in compiz, they may have fixed that by now
2008-12-24T08:50:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	kdogg	does ctrl-alt F1 bring up a terminal
2008-12-24T08:53:00.000Z	kdogg	Jack_Sparrow	I just rebooted, and it hung at the peach colored loading screen right after you login, and i cannot bring up a terminal
2008-12-24T08:54:00.000Z	kdogg	Jack_Sparrow	but the mouse works
2008-12-24T08:54:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	kdogg	NOt sure what is going on, what version of ubuntu, and what video card?
2009-01-20T02:33:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	kdogg	burning the cd at the slowest possible speed seems to help and noapic and acpi=off on the command line
2009-01-20T02:34:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	kdogg	turn off quiet and splash to see where it is hanging.. wifi is a prime suspect
2009-01-20T02:34:00.000Z	kdogg	Jack_Sparrow	I have tried both of those solutions, and I have downloaded, the non 64 bit, and i dl'd kubuntu, all have the same problem.
2009-01-20T02:36:00.000Z	kdogg	Jack_Sparrow	when i press buttons to get to the install program, i can then install, but if i dont press random buttons, the install process will never finish. Now that it is installed, every time I want to use ubuntu, i have to press random buttons during boot
2009-01-20T02:37:00.000Z	kdogg	Jack_Sparrow	i will now see where it is hanging, but iirc, it hangs at more than one point, like it will hang, then i hit a key, then it hangs at another point. if you press a random button every time it hangs it gets through all of them.
2009-01-20T02:39:00.000Z	kdogg	Jack_Sparrow	i mean any random key too, like when it hangs, if you press the power button, that will make it work until it hangs again.
2009-01-20T02:40:00.000Z	kdogg	Jack_Sparrow	its almost as if the bootup process is dependant on me pressing buttons
2009-01-20T02:41:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	kdogg	I would google up your hardware and see what is going on and how others with your hardware have gotten it to work
