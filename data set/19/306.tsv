2012-04-22T09:50:00.000Z	ShadowFios		so i have a wifi problem it says firmware missing can  anybody help?
2012-04-22T09:52:00.000Z	potat	ShadowFios	can you run lspci -nn
2012-04-22T09:55:00.000Z	ShadowFios	potat	i have and i dont know what im looking for
2012-04-22T09:55:00.000Z	potat	ShadowFios	look for WLAN
2012-04-22T10:36:00.000Z	potat	ShadowFios	did you find a line for WLAN in the outpt of lspci -nn
2012-04-22T10:40:00.000Z	ShadowFios	potat	no wlan in there at all
2012-04-22T10:41:00.000Z	potat	ShadowFios	Did you already try System > Administration > Additional Drivers
2012-04-22T10:43:00.000Z	ShadowFios	potat	yes it spits out downloading package indexes fail please check you network status most divers will no be availible
2012-04-22T10:45:00.000Z	ShadowFios	potat	and then it says no proprietary drivers in use on this system
2012-04-22T10:45:00.000Z	potat	ShadowFios	Hmm. but that computer is connected to the Internet, right?
2012-04-22T10:46:00.000Z	ShadowFios	potat	no its not im on my ipod right now
2012-04-22T10:48:00.000Z	potat	ShadowFios	Ok, you need to get connected so you can get the drivers (easiest way). Do you have an Ethernet cable to connect your laptop to your router?
2012-04-22T10:50:00.000Z	ShadowFios	potat	i belive i do but i cant right now
2012-04-22T10:50:00.000Z	ShadowFios	potat	si what do i do after i hook it up to the router?
2012-04-22T10:51:00.000Z	potat	ShadowFios	Ok, you should do that when you get the chance. Just run "Additional Drivers"
2012-04-22T10:51:00.000Z	potat	ShadowFios	It should detect your wireless card and install what you need.
2012-04-22T10:52:00.000Z	ShadowFios	potat	and then everything will be nice and good in the world(i hope)?
2012-04-22T10:53:00.000Z	potat	ShadowFios	hopefully. Wireless used to be a big hassle but Ubuntu did a great job of rounding up all the firmware
2012-04-22T10:54:00.000Z	ShadowFios	potat	ok cool kthxbai
