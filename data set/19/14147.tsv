2009-05-10T14:46:00.000Z	harlemdavvey		guys do you use gnome, kde or a lighter window manager?
2009-05-10T14:46:00.000Z	Severian	harlemdavvey	yes, usually.
2009-05-10T14:47:00.000Z	Severian	harlemdavvey	I use those and one that is not lighter.  enlightenment.
2009-05-10T14:47:00.000Z	harlemdavvey		and have you ever used a lighter environment like enlightenment, fluxbox, ...??
2009-05-10T14:48:00.000Z	harlemdavvey		i would love to use a sort-of -alternative window manager but i really cannot find some guides
2009-05-10T14:48:00.000Z	Severian	harlemdavvey	openbox is my current preference for a lightweight manager.  Install crunchbang.  It is Ubuntu customized for openbox.
2009-05-10T14:53:00.000Z	harlemdavvey		is crunchbang installable with terminal command?
2009-05-10T14:55:00.000Z	Severian	harlemdavvey	crunchbang is an installable Linux distro, just like ubuntu.  In fact, it is derived from Ubuntu.  You boot from the CD and then install from the menu.
2009-05-10T14:57:00.000Z	harlemdavvey		severian : i don't want to install with iso

2009-05-10T14:59:00.000Z	harlemdavvey		;)
2009-05-10T15:00:00.000Z	Severian	harlemdavvey	as someone else said, you can install openbox from apt-get.  Crunchbang has a nicely configured openbox and is better to start with.  But, if you don't have time, then make do.  Good luck.
