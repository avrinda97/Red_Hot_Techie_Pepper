2011-01-10T08:13:00.000Z	Danny78	theholder	 you may just have a bad cord---  loook for the spot, cut it and crimp it back together
2011-01-10T08:14:00.000Z	theholder	Danny78	its hissing on the speakers too
2011-01-10T08:14:00.000Z	Danny78	theholder	 what's your soundcard?
2011-01-10T08:18:00.000Z	Danny78	theholder	 is that onboard?
2011-01-10T08:20:00.000Z	Danny78	theholder	 even the crappy $30 cards are worth not having strange hissing and other weird stuff--  I've never cared for Realtek onboard audio
2011-01-10T08:21:00.000Z	theholder	Danny78	well i cant change right now =/
2011-01-10T08:23:00.000Z	Danny78	theholder	 there are other things you could try like make sure all the cords and connectors look ok.  Dust off the motherboard.
2011-01-10T08:23:00.000Z	Danny78	theholder	 x-fi isn't bad for the price
2011-01-10T08:24:00.000Z	Danny78	theholder	 I'd spray compressed air in all the inlets and then get one of those coolers that goes under it
