2004-11-02T06:27:00.000Z	enrico_		channel: im here to give my spare time for the italian translation of the web site
2004-11-02T06:28:00.000Z	enrico_		another thing... why not making the installation as "easy" as in windows xp?
2004-11-02T06:30:00.000Z	enrico_		..: well ive actually installed ubuntu's for my little brothere
2004-11-02T06:30:00.000Z	enrico_		and yes i do think it's not that easy...
2004-11-02T06:31:00.000Z	enrico_		basically... not everyone knows what the vesa driver is... so 
2004-11-02T06:31:00.000Z	enrico_		considering that is possible... it could be nice making a script to let ubuntu install like knoppix boot
2004-11-02T06:32:00.000Z	enrico_		a safer OS that ms's, in less time
2004-11-02T06:33:00.000Z	enrico_		youall: nooo, i dont really think so.. because vesa driver is ok for the 95% of the hw now in commerce... you could make a type of installation were everything is automated...
2004-11-02T06:33:00.000Z	enrico_		like at the boot prompt an "easy" option
2004-11-02T06:34:00.000Z	enrico_		but it works
2004-11-02T06:35:00.000Z	|trey|	enrico_	you can have it so the installer just installs files if you really wanted, already...
2004-11-02T06:43:00.000Z	|trey|	enrico_	yay... Ubuntu should have more things like that... Red Hat has classes  :)
2004-11-02T07:03:00.000Z	|trey|	enrico_	so far, for me, no... Ubuntu packages should though  :(
2004-11-02T07:05:00.000Z	|trey|	enrico_	when its not in main or resticted, activate the universe and multiverse repo... when you are done, can then deactivate...
2004-11-02T07:06:00.000Z	enrico_	|trey|	it isnt a very useful solution
2004-11-02T07:06:00.000Z	|trey|	enrico_	you can do all that in synaptic...
2004-11-02T07:24:00.000Z	|trey|	enrico_	add it...
2004-11-02T07:31:00.000Z	|trey|	enrico_	I already said that I agree, they should be added... but their not... add it manually... file a bug though perhaps?
2004-11-02T07:32:00.000Z	|trey|	enrico_	and don't yell... please  :)
