2004-10-04T14:23:00.000Z	highvoltage		ok. now when I restart cups it said that child exits with code 98
2004-10-04T14:23:00.000Z	highvoltage		yes, I am accessing it with localhost:631
2004-10-04T14:23:00.000Z	highvoltage		But when I log in it tells me that web administration is disabled
2004-10-04T14:24:00.000Z	highvoltage		I can try that, even though I'm root already :)
2004-10-04T14:25:00.000Z	highvoltage		should it be /etc/init.d/cupsd? In debian it's cupsys (and ubuntu)
2004-10-04T14:25:00.000Z	highvoltage		I booted from knoppix and chrooted to change my root passwd
2004-10-04T14:26:00.000Z	highvoltage		only after that I read the FAQ and found out about the sudo thing
2004-10-04T14:26:00.000Z	highvoltage		ah crap
2004-10-04T14:26:00.000Z	highvoltage		ok. I'll email it to someone else and they can print it :)
2004-10-04T14:27:00.000Z	topyli	highvoltage	oh you have a root password! what is it? :)
2005-07-20T12:46:00.000Z	highvoltage	topyli	it doesn't take much to make gnome-terminal crash
2005-07-20T12:46:00.000Z	highvoltage	topyli	running things in screen helps
2005-07-20T12:47:00.000Z	topyli	highvoltage	but it's annoying. i love gnome-terminal every other way
2005-07-20T12:47:00.000Z	highvoltage	topyli	have you tried Terminal before?
2005-07-20T12:47:00.000Z	topyli	highvoltage	i think it's a gnome 2.10 feature :)
2005-07-20T12:51:00.000Z	topyli	highvoltage	i can't debug now because my work box is down, but could this be because of the sunOS/linux switches?
2005-07-20T12:51:00.000Z	highvoltage	topyli	anything is possible, my improbability drive isn't working now, but as soon as my new kernel has compiled I'll tell you.
2005-07-20T12:54:00.000Z	topyli	highvoltage	ok. i'll turn on the linux box when i have business at that part of town too
2005-07-20T12:55:00.000Z	topyli	highvoltage	my vacation starts today so i shut it down. what was i thinking! :)
