2007-04-24T15:38:00.000Z	Ravengbc		i've set up ndiswrapper for my Linksys card, and when i do the command ndiswrapper -l i get the following result:
2007-04-24T15:38:00.000Z	Ravengbc		lsbcmnds : driver installed
2007-04-24T15:38:00.000Z	Ravengbc		device (14E4:4318) present (alternate driver :bcm43xx)
2007-04-24T15:38:00.000Z	Ravengbc		yet, the card still won't work. any suggestions?
2007-04-24T15:39:00.000Z	orbin	Ravengbc	define won't work
2007-04-24T15:40:00.000Z	orbin	Ravengbc	does it light up when you modprobe ndiswrapper?
2007-04-24T15:44:00.000Z	orbin	Ravengbc	does lsmod | grep ndiswrapper show it's laoded?  does iwconfig show a wireless interface?
2007-04-24T15:45:00.000Z	orbin	Ravengbc	please prepend my nick so iyour messages are highlighted for me
2007-04-24T15:46:00.000Z	orbin	Ravengbc	does lsmod | grep ndiswrapper show it's loaded?
2007-04-24T15:47:00.000Z	orbin	Ravengbc	replace i with a small L :)
2007-04-24T15:49:00.000Z	orbin	Ravengbc	ok, it's loaded.  have you blacklisted bcm43xx?
2007-04-24T15:50:00.000Z	orbin	Ravengbc	yes, otherwise it's likely to use that over ndiswrapper.  just to confirm, does lsmod | grep bcm43xx return anything?
2007-04-24T15:51:00.000Z	orbin	Ravengbc	gksudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist
2007-04-24T15:51:00.000Z	orbin	Ravengbc	then add a 'blacklist bcm43xx' line
2007-04-24T15:53:00.000Z	orbin	Ravengbc	that will prevent it from loading at boot.  you can unload it now and try ndiswrapper again
2007-04-24T15:53:00.000Z	orbin	Ravengbc	sudo modprobe -r bcm43xx
2007-04-24T15:54:00.000Z	orbin	Ravengbc	you might not even need to restart, just try reloading ndiswrapper
2007-04-24T15:54:00.000Z	orbin	Ravengbc	modprobe -r ndiswrapper, then modprobe ndiswrapper
2007-04-24T15:54:00.000Z	orbin	Ravengbc	sudo in front of those.
