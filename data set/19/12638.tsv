2005-08-07T16:34:00.000Z	arbir	Seveas	what is the official Ubuntu way of installing Mono ?
2005-08-07T16:35:00.000Z	Seveas	arbir	the nicest is in sites-available/default
2005-08-07T16:35:00.000Z	arbir	Seveas	which would be inside the Virtual host * tag
2005-08-07T16:35:00.000Z	Seveas	arbir	correct
2005-08-07T16:37:00.000Z	Seveas	arbir	nothing, I;m just answering your question :)

2005-08-07T16:42:00.000Z	arbir	Seveas	how do i know my apt is fetching from the backports?
2005-08-07T16:43:00.000Z	arbir	Seveas	do you think my apt is using the backports ? --> http://paste.ubuntulinux.nl/883
2005-08-07T16:44:00.000Z	Seveas	arbir	no
2005-08-07T16:45:00.000Z	Seveas	arbir	do apt-get update before apt-get install mono
2005-08-07T16:55:00.000Z	arbir	Seveas	the mono in the backports is also quite old... something like 1.0.5
