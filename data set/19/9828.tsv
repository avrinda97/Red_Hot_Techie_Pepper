2006-09-08T09:15:00.000Z	jordan	shriphani_	Yes.
2006-09-08T09:17:00.000Z	jordan	shriphani_	Once you have copied the files run `sudo modprobe bcm43xx` and you should be able to connect.
2006-09-08T09:24:00.000Z	shriphani_	jordan	i still cant connect
2006-09-08T09:24:00.000Z	jordan	shriphani_	How are you trying to connect?
2006-09-08T09:25:00.000Z	jordan	shriphani_	Have you entered in the SSID? ( network name )?
2006-09-08T09:26:00.000Z	shriphani_	jordan	its there
2006-09-08T09:26:00.000Z	jordan	shriphani_	I don't know much what to do beyond that, sorry. But just to be sure, what is the output of `sudo modprobe bcm43xx`?
2006-09-08T09:27:00.000Z	shriphani_	jordan	nothing
2006-09-08T09:27:00.000Z	jordan	shriphani_	That means at least that worked...
2006-09-08T09:27:00.000Z	jordan	shriphani_	what about ifup?
2006-09-08T09:28:00.000Z	jordan	shriphani_	It depends on what your wireless interface is called...
2006-09-08T09:28:00.000Z	shriphani_	jordan	eth1
2006-09-08T09:29:00.000Z	jordan	shriphani_	first `sudo ifdown eth0`
2006-09-08T09:29:00.000Z	jordan	shriphani_	I mean eth1 sorry
2006-09-08T09:30:00.000Z	jordan	shriphani_	then `sudo ifup eth1` and past the output
2006-09-08T09:31:00.000Z	jordan	shriphani_	I really don't know very much, mabie somebody more knowlageable can help you out more.
2006-09-08T09:32:00.000Z	jordan	shriphani_	All I can suggest is that you install network-manager-gnome as it automatically detects networks and other nice things like that.
