2007-05-28T06:14:00.000Z	jamster545		why did i get kicked for accidentally hitting ping earlier?
2007-05-28T06:15:00.000Z	jamster545		always install windows first
2007-05-28T06:16:00.000Z	jamster545		go to system settings in ubuntu to change splash
2007-05-28T06:16:00.000Z	jamster545		heriam2345: go to system settings and click splash screen
2007-05-28T06:17:00.000Z	jamster545		gparted is as easy a QTParted
2007-05-28T06:17:00.000Z	kitche	jamster545	I don't use QTParted either :)
2007-05-28T06:20:00.000Z	kitche	jamster545	develop what
2007-05-28T06:21:00.000Z	kitche	jamster545	you don't need a book to learn to program just read some docs
2007-05-28T06:22:00.000Z	jamster545	kitche	where can i find these docs?
2007-05-28T06:22:00.000Z	kitche	jamster545	depends what language you want to learn myself I know Java gonna learn some ruby so I can program in that to program in Java
2007-05-28T06:40:00.000Z	kitche	jamster545	pretty much since the spam this channel gets
2007-05-28T07:53:00.000Z	kitche	jamster545	then your source is messed up but is this bash or c++ since that error seems to be bash
2007-05-28T07:54:00.000Z	kitche	jamster545	then your source is messed up :)
2007-05-28T07:54:00.000Z	kitche	jamster545	pastebin the source file want to see how it looks
2007-05-28T07:57:00.000Z	kitche	jamster545	umm are you using a program to make this program
2007-05-28T07:58:00.000Z	kitche	jamster545	since namespace std is probably what it's puking on
2007-05-28T07:58:00.000Z	kitche	jamster545	since C++ programs should not have a namespace in it
2007-05-30T06:15:00.000Z	kitche	jamster545	I only see one ajax in here
