2004-11-10T17:25:00.000Z	altan		 how can I rename files to be sequential, like from whatever.mp3 and kickasssong.mp3 to 1.mp3 / 2.mp3 and so on?
2004-11-10T17:27:00.000Z	spiv	altan	x=0; for f in *.mp3 ; do mv $f ${x}.mp3 ; x=$(($x+1)) ; done  # something like that.
2004-11-10T17:30:00.000Z	spiv	altan	Although it probably wants extra quoting for filenames with spaces...
2004-11-10T17:31:00.000Z	altan	spiv	damn, I should have looked more carefully before I did that, I lost a bunch of files now :/
2004-11-10T17:31:00.000Z	altan		any way to get them back?
2004-11-10T17:32:00.000Z	spiv	altan	eek.  I was assuming you'd backup the files first :/
2004-11-10T17:32:00.000Z	altan		they're backed up on another disk, but i'd have to reboot since that disk is not connected
2004-11-10T17:32:00.000Z	spiv		Ah.
2004-11-10T17:33:00.000Z	spiv		It should've refused to mv if there were spaces, because it would've gotten too many arguments.
2004-11-10T17:34:00.000Z	spiv	altan	are you sure it lost files, or did it just fail to rename some?
2004-11-10T17:35:00.000Z	altan	spiv	it gave me > on a new line whenever I hit enter, which was probably a prompt for each file, but then I, uh, got bored and hit ctrl+c
2004-11-10T17:36:00.000Z	altan		oh well, not a big problem
2004-11-10T17:36:00.000Z	spiv		It shouldn't prompt for each file... does mv usually prompt for you?
2004-11-10T17:36:00.000Z	altan		no
2004-11-10T17:36:00.000Z	spiv		(i.e. have you set mv -i to be the default)?
2004-11-10T17:36:00.000Z	spiv		You're using bash?
2004-11-10T17:36:00.000Z	altan		I haven't changed anything
2004-11-10T17:36:00.000Z	altan		yeah bash
2004-11-10T17:37:00.000Z	spiv	altan	Odd, then it works for me... maybe you made a transcription error?
