2008-09-29T01:29:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	perillux	That means you need to install some additional libraries (libbzip2) and the supporting header files to be linked against
2008-09-29T01:30:00.000Z	perillux	IntuitiveNipple	there is no bzlib2 package
2008-09-29T01:31:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	perillux	The error you reported was with "libbzip2" not "bzlip2"
2008-09-29T01:31:00.000Z	perillux	IntuitiveNipple	there is no libbzip2 package either
2008-09-29T01:32:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	perillux	There is: "lib32bz2-dev"
2008-09-29T01:33:00.000Z	perillux	IntuitiveNipple	I checked the list.  but they don't give the exact package names so it's hard for me to find them sometimes
2008-09-29T01:33:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	perillux	Also, see "libbz2-dev"
2008-09-29T01:34:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	perillux	You'll want the second of those I mentioned, unless building 32-bit on x86-64
2008-09-29T01:34:00.000Z	perillux	IntuitiveNipple	ok just installed the second
2008-09-29T01:34:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	perillux	The trick is to use "apt cache search bzip" to get some leads, looking for lib* packages
2008-09-29T01:36:00.000Z	perillux	IntuitiveNipple	it got past that check, but now it says couldn't find lua.h.   Anyways thanks for your help I might be able to get the others on my own..   But there is 1 more concern.  before running "./configure" the instructions say to run "./autogen.sh"  I run it and I get this output:  "bash: ./autogen.sh: /bin/sh^M: bad interpreter: No such file or directory"
2008-09-29T01:47:00.000Z	perillux	IntuitiveNipple	ok, there is just 1 other thing I'm concerned with.  When running "./configure" one of the checks says "checking for X... no"   could this be a potential problem?
2008-09-29T01:48:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	perillux	What package are you building?
2008-09-29T01:48:00.000Z	perillux	IntuitiveNipple	it's a game engine
2008-09-29T01:48:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	perillux	Well, the configure options and included libraries depend on what you want it to do. Without knowing all the requirements I can't really say.
2008-09-29T01:49:00.000Z	perillux	IntuitiveNipple	the script ran to completion without any errors.  I'm just wondering about that line that says "checking for X.. no"  that sounds kinda bad.  or is it not a problem?
2008-09-29T01:50:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	perillux	That is part of the configure script environment checks... only you know if you want that X support, and what precisely it is
2008-09-29T01:51:00.000Z	perillux	IntuitiveNipple	well how can I get it to say yes.  I thought I did have X.  isn't that what I'm using right now?
2008-09-29T01:52:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	perillux	The configure checks are *usually* looking for the development libraries and headers, remember
