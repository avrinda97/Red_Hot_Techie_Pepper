2007-10-08T12:59:00.000Z	scguy318	indraveni	does /dev/video exist?
2007-10-08T12:59:00.000Z	indraveni	scguy318	i created it using mknod
2007-10-08T14:43:00.000Z	scguy318	indraveni	/dev/video or /dev/video0?
2007-10-08T14:43:00.000Z	scguy318	indraveni	you might have to make a symlink
2007-10-08T14:55:00.000Z	indraveni	scguy318	i have video0 created using mknod and then made a link to video
2007-10-08T14:56:00.000Z	scguy318	indraveni	you shouldn't have to create with mknod, udev should take care of that fun stuff
2007-10-08T14:56:00.000Z	indraveni	scguy318	in the error message its showing /dev/video0
2007-10-08T14:56:00.000Z	scguy318	indraveni	can't you just use ln -s?
2007-10-08T14:59:00.000Z	indraveni	scguy318	there is nothing under /dev/ with name video
2007-10-08T14:59:00.000Z	indraveni	scguy318	then for which shall i create a link ?
2007-10-08T14:59:00.000Z	indraveni	scguy318	udev is not doing that for me
