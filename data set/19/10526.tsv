2006-06-09T08:50:00.000Z	cartur25		Hey guys, I'm trying to install kpodder - when I type "make" in the untarballed directory I get "command not found" why is that?
2006-06-09T08:51:00.000Z	troy_s	cartur25	 you need build essential.
2006-06-09T08:51:00.000Z	cartur25	troy_s	Is build essential the command I should use instead of make ?
2006-06-09T08:52:00.000Z	troy_s	cartur25	 no, build-essential is a metapackage that has the basic build tools.
2006-06-09T08:52:00.000Z	troy_s	cartur25	 you will need more possibly as well... but that should get you started.
2006-06-09T08:53:00.000Z	troy_s	cartur25	 very hot.  very very hot.
2006-06-09T08:53:00.000Z	troy_s	cartur25	 sudo apt-get install build-essential
2006-06-09T08:58:00.000Z	troy_s	cartur25	 you need the -dev of various libs.
2006-06-09T09:00:00.000Z	cartur25	troy_s	What command do I use to download those -dev files?
2006-06-09T09:01:00.000Z	troy_s	cartur25	 first you need to know what one.  it is as easy as 'sudo apt-get install blahlib-dev'
2006-06-09T09:15:00.000Z	troy_s	cartur25	 when your make fails, go to the TOPMOST error and look there.
2006-06-09T09:15:00.000Z	troy_s	cartur25	 it will usually say something like blah header not found.  then you add the lib-dev
2006-06-09T09:20:00.000Z	troy_s	cartur25	 you must be in the dir with the makefile.  this means usually starting with ./configure, then make, then make install
2006-06-09T09:55:00.000Z	troy_s	cartur25	 did it finish?
2006-06-09T09:56:00.000Z	troy_s	cartur25	 nope.  you need your x dev files.
2006-06-09T09:56:00.000Z	troy_s	cartur25	 so add them.
2006-06-09T10:00:00.000Z	troy_s	cartur25	 sorry... um... let me quickly look... there are MANY of them.
2006-06-09T10:01:00.000Z	troy_s	cartur25	 hold tight... looking.
2006-06-09T10:01:00.000Z	troy_s	cartur25	 sudo apt-get install xorg-dev
