2008-12-24T06:58:00.000Z	nwillettjeffries		ok so you do have the codecs then. Are you running compiz?
2008-12-24T06:59:00.000Z	nwillettjeffries		ok so it's not compiz then. Is it when you open any window at all? are there any other programs that involve video playback running (firefox with flash, etc...)
2008-12-24T07:01:00.000Z	nwillettjeffries		is it just .mov files or all video files?
2008-12-24T07:03:00.000Z	nwillettjeffries		hmm it would be nice to know if it's just .mov files and also whether it's just totem. Like will vlc run it?
2008-12-24T07:03:00.000Z	nwillettjeffries		ok
2008-12-24T07:05:00.000Z	nwillettjeffries		@raerlynn how much ram you running?
2008-12-24T07:06:00.000Z	nwillettjeffries		@shing kk great. I've had similar problems with totem in the past... vlc or mplayer are the way to go...
2008-12-24T07:07:00.000Z	nwillettjeffries		no problem. have fun...
2008-12-24T07:08:00.000Z	nwillettjeffries		@varth is anyone helping you?
2008-12-24T07:08:00.000Z	nwillettjeffries		@varth ok so brasero won't burn a dvd?
2008-12-24T07:09:00.000Z	Varth	nwillettjeffries	Yeah. It lets me add the files and everything, but once I click the burn button on the bottom right and the options dialog comes up, it won't let me actually initiate the burn by clicking the burn button in the dialog.
2008-12-24T07:10:00.000Z	Varth	nwillettjeffries	I've tried pretty much all of the options, but the button remains disabled.
2008-12-24T07:11:00.000Z	Varth	nwillettjeffries	DVD is in drive. It's DVD+R.
2008-12-24T07:12:00.000Z	Varth	nwillettjeffries	Okay. Thank you. Brasero's help files aren't helping at all.
2008-12-24T07:12:00.000Z	Varth	nwillettjeffries	An .avi file.
2008-12-24T07:15:00.000Z	Varth	nwillettjeffries	Nope. Converted from a wmv off of my cousin's camera.
2008-12-24T07:18:00.000Z	Varth	nwillettjeffries	No. Do you have one that you would recommend?
2008-12-24T07:20:00.000Z	Varth	nwillettjeffries	Okay. Thanks.
2008-12-24T07:20:00.000Z	Varth	nwillettjeffries	It's all good. thanks for your time
