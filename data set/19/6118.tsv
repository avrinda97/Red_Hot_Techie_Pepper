2008-03-10T08:28:00.000Z	pakikid		i am getting an error from vbox The VirtualBox kernel driver is not accessible to the current user. Make sure that the user has write permissions for /dev/vboxdrv by adding them to the vboxusers groups. You will need to logout for the change to take effect..
2008-03-10T08:28:00.000Z	pakikid		VBox status code: -1909 (VERR_VM_DRIVER_NOT_ACCESSIBLE).
2008-03-10T08:29:00.000Z	jester7	pakikid	you have to add your username to the vboxusers group
2008-03-10T08:32:00.000Z	jester7	pakikid	go to System->Administration->Users and Groups
2008-03-10T08:33:00.000Z	pakikid	jester7	then what
2008-03-10T08:34:00.000Z	jester7	pakikid	then click the "manage groups" button
2008-03-10T08:34:00.000Z	jester7	pakikid	scroll to the vboxusers group, and click properties, then put a checkmark next to your username
2008-03-10T08:36:00.000Z	pakikid	jester7	i am on suse
2008-03-10T08:37:00.000Z	jester7	pakikid	lmao, well um, i don't know what to to tell you
2008-03-10T08:38:00.000Z	jester7	pakikid	were you planning on running ubuntu inside the vbox?  why would you ask that in an ubuntu chat?
2008-03-10T08:38:00.000Z	pakikid	jester7	yes i was
2008-03-10T08:39:00.000Z	pakikid	jester7	so how can i add to suse
2008-03-10T08:39:00.000Z	jester7	pakikid	i have no idea.  i'm sure that's pretty easy to find in suse documentation
2008-03-10T08:41:00.000Z	jester7	pakikid	in suse, go to "Control Center" then "user management"
2008-03-10T08:42:00.000Z	jester7	pakikid	then it should be pretty close to teh same, look look at the groups, find vboxusers, and add your username to it
2008-03-10T08:42:00.000Z	pakikid	jester7	i am looking in groups there are no vbox users there
2008-03-10T08:43:00.000Z	jester7	pakikid	well, that's unfortunate.  i've never run into that issue
2008-03-10T08:43:00.000Z	jester7	pakikid	vboxusers
2008-03-10T08:44:00.000Z	jester7	pakikid	but i doubt it will have the correct security rights for running vbox
