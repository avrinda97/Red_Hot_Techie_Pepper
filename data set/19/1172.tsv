2011-04-23T15:52:00.000Z	kingofswords		on 64 bit ubuntu...just dled 32bit how to get it to work plz?
2011-04-23T15:52:00.000Z	kingofswords		i dled ia32libs earlier
2011-04-23T15:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kingofswords	 clarify what you mean.
2011-04-24T00:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kingofswords	 theres a repo withj google earth in it. or some tool to set it up.
2011-04-24T00:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kingofswords	 no idea. no idea why it would matter if its 64 or 32bit..
2011-04-24T00:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kingofswords	 thats how i normally install it on my systems.
2011-04-24T00:46:00.000Z	kingofswords	Dr_Willis	i tried 64bit ver b4 and had major problems...i think it doesnt work
2011-04-24T00:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kingofswords	 tried it befor when? yesterday? last month?
2011-04-24T00:48:00.000Z	kingofswords	Dr_Willis	 but surely if i have the ia32libs it should work
2011-04-24T00:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kingofswords	 no idea. ive never had issues with it not working
2011-08-21T01:28:00.000Z	kingofswords	Dr_Willis	thx what is X?
2011-08-21T01:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kingofswords	 read wht ubottu said just 3 lines above.....
2011-08-21T01:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kingofswords	 why do you want 1.8 when you did not even know what it was 60 sec ago?
2011-08-21T01:31:00.000Z	kingofswords	Dr_Willis	because i have a game running in wine that lags and audio out of sync and read on wineapp that xorg 1.8 fixes this problem
2011-08-21T01:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kingofswords	 you would risk breaking the rest of the system.. or at least teh GUI. :)
2011-08-21T01:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kingofswords	 theres ppa's of updated versions of Xorg i belive... I dont use them
2011-08-22T05:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kingofswords	 new release every 6 mo.
2011-08-22T05:44:00.000Z	kingofswords	Dr_Willis	no i mean if i use update manager to go from 10.4 to 10.10?
2011-08-22T05:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kingofswords	 would depend on the speeds of your connection. its bsically downlading some 600+mb of data.. then working on the install..
