2007-06-01T09:58:00.000Z	tavl_		anyone has a guess my ubuntu is accessing many https pages except those from Last.fm? =S
2007-06-01T10:00:00.000Z	stefg	tavl_	just checked... last.fm seems to be down
2007-06-01T10:00:00.000Z	tavl_	stefg	ok, let me see too...
2007-06-01T10:01:00.000Z	stefg	tavl_	if you're not logged in, you get a page, but my dashboard doesn't work either
2007-06-01T10:02:00.000Z	tavl_	stefg	have you ever tried this on your ubuntu or first time trying to get to the login/dashboard page?
2007-06-01T10:02:00.000Z	stefg	tavl_	i use iton a regular basis, and it works... it seems a last.fm problem atm, not yours (or mine :-) )
2007-06-01T10:03:00.000Z	tavl_	stefg	i, at this moment, can access the main page and even the login screen... but i'm getting "timeout"s before the hit the profile screen... =S...
2007-06-01T10:04:00.000Z	stefg	tavl_	one more proof it's last.fm
2007-06-01T10:05:00.000Z	tavl_	stefg	i'm not sure, but i think it's the same reason why none of my scrobbler capable apps are scrobbling my musics... looks like timeout to login... =S
2007-06-01T10:06:00.000Z	tavl_	stefg	i have a windows machine, right here by my side, and i can login/scrobble everything from there... =S... so, is it really a last.fm problem? =S
2007-06-01T10:07:00.000Z	stefg	tavl_	hmmm.... could be a cache thing
2007-06-01T10:08:00.000Z	stefg	tavl_	but i still think it#s last.fm (they constantly have load problems)
2007-06-01T10:10:00.000Z	tavl_	stefg	what you mean by "cache thing"?! if its anything related to Firefox, i wouldn't agree, as i have tested it with lynx and a another text-based browser (which name a don't remember)
2007-06-01T10:14:00.000Z	stefg	tavl_	so what i can tell is that i've got the same same problem,,, last-exit works, but i can't log in. who knows what they did with their site
2007-06-01T10:16:00.000Z	tavl_	stefg	i'm using ubuntu 7.04... a friend, with the previous version, could login at a time i couldn't... i thought about missing packages, but found no logic in this, as there isn't something like "https-package".. =S... 
2007-06-01T10:21:00.000Z	stefg	tavl_	so i fired up my windows-vm to check, and i can't log in neither
2007-06-01T10:23:00.000Z	tavl_	stefg	i think ill test it all a bit later... have a job to finish... anyway, thnks for the help... i'll look for your help here, later, ok?
2007-06-01T10:23:00.000Z	stefg	tavl_	it's last.fm's fault, believe me
2007-06-01T10:27:00.000Z	tavl_	stefg	well, maybe YOUR case is a last.fm problem... if it's is mine too, then i'm the luckless one, as i'm trying to put those things (scrobblers) to work for a month... =S... i've tested everything, from rythmbox to amarok...
