2006-03-05T13:59:00.000Z	irv		this is like wading through treacle
2006-03-05T13:59:00.000Z	irv		I hate moving distros
2006-03-05T14:00:00.000Z	_jason	irv	what bad luck did you have?
2006-03-05T14:02:00.000Z	_jason	irv	check system > prefs > screensaver > advanced
2006-03-05T14:18:00.000Z	irv	_jason	thanks for the system --> pref --> screen saver -->  advanced tip but unfortunately everytime I hit the advanced tab my system locks up
2006-03-05T14:21:00.000Z	_jason	irv	check ~/.xscreensaver, don't know why your system would lock up
2006-03-05T14:27:00.000Z	_jason	irv	you don't have .xscreensaver in $HOME?
2006-03-05T14:27:00.000Z	irv	_jason	not that I can see
2006-03-05T14:27:00.000Z	_jason	irv	are you using breezy?
2006-03-05T14:28:00.000Z	_jason	irv	'cat ~/.xscreensaver' confirms no such file?
2006-03-05T14:28:00.000Z	irv	_jason	sorry yes there is output for that
2006-03-05T14:29:00.000Z	_jason	irv	dpmsEnabled:, dpmsStandby:, dpmsSuspend:, dpmsOff: correspond to power management settings
2006-03-05T14:31:00.000Z	irv	_jason	I can just edit dpmesEnabled False, and it will turn it off?
2006-03-05T14:31:00.000Z	_jason	irv	let me verify by using the gui myself
2006-03-05T14:32:00.000Z	_jason	irv	yes, just change to False, restart should not be required afaik
2006-03-05T14:44:00.000Z	irv	_jason	it crashed again
2006-03-05T14:45:00.000Z	_jason	irv	try searching the forums to see if anyone had a similar problem ubuntuforums.org
2006-03-05T14:46:00.000Z	irv	_jason	doing that, but laso installing the initail updates I've been prompted to that might solve the problem
2006-03-05T14:47:00.000Z	_jason	irv	how would I know :P
