2010-08-05T06:08:00.000Z	ottermaton		Does anyone know anything about fixing a a slow resume from suspend? In particular on a Dell Vostro v13
2010-08-05T06:08:00.000Z	systemd0wn	ottermaton	most of my suspend/hibernate problems come from driver issues.
2010-08-05T06:10:00.000Z	ottermaton	systemd0wn	what would you suggest I look at?
2010-08-05T06:12:00.000Z	systemd0wn	ottermaton	wow, ya it could be damn near anything. Ok, MY issues all stem from acpi issues for instance I can't dim my screen and things like that. Ok, i would do an lspci and dmesg and comb through
2010-08-05T06:12:00.000Z	systemd0wn	ottermaton	get a list of all your hardware and look up each one individually and its compatibility with linux
2010-08-05T06:13:00.000Z	systemd0wn	ottermaton	thankfully people much smarter than us have usually worked out many of these issues, especially with common laptops
2010-08-05T06:15:00.000Z	ottermaton	systemd0wn	well, I've been searching around and can't find anything really relevant. I even came across a guy who says his vostro v13 resumes in 2.5 seconds.
2010-08-05T06:16:00.000Z	systemd0wn	ottermaton	and how long does that take? Is he using the same OS? 2.5 is pretty damn fast
2010-08-05T06:16:00.000Z	systemd0wn	ottermaton	er how long does yours take?
2010-08-05T06:16:00.000Z	ottermaton	systemd0wn	mine takes about 30 seconds. Same machine, same version (10.04)
2010-08-05T06:17:00.000Z	systemd0wn	ottermaton	you upgraded to the latest kernel?
2010-08-05T06:17:00.000Z	ottermaton	systemd0wn	yes, I keep up with updates
2010-08-05T06:18:00.000Z	systemd0wn	ottermaton	ya, man if he has the same OS and hardware but yours is running slower i really have no idea. I would say driver issues but if both of you have default installs i dunno
2010-08-05T06:20:00.000Z	ottermaton	systemd0wn	I don't know if his is exactly a default install, but, yes it is puzzling
2010-08-05T06:20:00.000Z	ottermaton	systemd0wn	thanks for the suggestions though
2010-08-05T06:20:00.000Z	systemd0wn	ottermaton	no problem. dmesg doesn't have any errors after you come back from suspend?
2010-08-05T06:21:00.000Z	ottermaton	systemd0wn	no it doesn't
2010-08-05T06:22:00.000Z	ottermaton	systemd0wn	I'm thinking it might have something to do with my wireless driver which is flaky. Actually, I'm going to experiment with some things
2010-08-05T06:23:00.000Z	systemd0wn	ottermaton	cool if i think of anything else i'll hit you up
