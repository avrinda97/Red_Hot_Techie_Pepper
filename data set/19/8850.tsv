2007-07-03T06:14:00.000Z	r00tintheb0x		thats why i said or vice versa, if you'd not be so fast to correct.
2007-07-03T06:14:00.000Z	r00tintheb0x		okay rich115 thats easy to fix.
2007-07-03T06:14:00.000Z	r00tintheb0x		Do you have a Windows XP cd that is bootable rich115 ?
2007-07-03T06:15:00.000Z	r00tintheb0x		get one and go into the repair console and type "fixboot" and "fixmbr"
2007-07-03T06:15:00.000Z	r00tintheb0x		and you'll be able to boot back into Windows.

2007-07-03T06:15:00.000Z	r00tintheb0x		=)
2007-07-03T06:15:00.000Z	r00tintheb0x		i'd sugguest a fixmbr.
2007-07-03T06:16:00.000Z	r00tintheb0x		you dont need to format it, it's just confused.

2007-07-03T06:16:00.000Z	nimbo	r00tintheb0x	no, hes on ubuntu live cd now
2007-07-03T06:16:00.000Z	nimbo	r00tintheb0x	he cant start windows
2007-07-03T06:17:00.000Z	nimbo	r00tintheb0x	ask him :P
2007-07-03T06:17:00.000Z	r00tintheb0x	nimbo	are you assuming that i was telling him to boot from hard disk into windows to fix his mbr?
2007-07-03T06:17:00.000Z	nimbo	r00tintheb0x	do you wanna emulate fixmbr with wine or how else??
2007-07-03T06:18:00.000Z	nimbo	r00tintheb0x	i already told him to do so ...
2007-07-03T06:18:00.000Z	nimbo	r00tintheb0x	he has no xp live cd
