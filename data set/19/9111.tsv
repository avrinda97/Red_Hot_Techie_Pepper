2007-03-04T12:39:00.000Z	mytruehero		How do I upgrade to 7.04?
2007-03-04T12:40:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mytruehero	if you have to ask, it might be wise to hold off till its at least a beta release
2007-03-04T12:41:00.000Z	mytruehero	IndyGunFreak	I'm trying to install KVM, and the instructions on help.ubuntu.com are for 7.04 only. It says "Install the 'kvm' package," but that package isn't in any of my repositories
2007-03-04T12:42:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mytruehero	well, good luck... Feisty is very unstable right now... as its being updated/worked on constantly
2007-03-04T12:42:00.000Z	mytruehero	IndyGunFreak	Er, ok. I guess I'll hold off, then
2007-03-04T12:42:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mytruehero	you gotta remember, Feisty hasnt' even hit beta release yet, its still in alpha...
2007-03-04T12:44:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mytruehero	i think so, hang on
2007-03-04T12:44:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mytruehero	are you running 6.10 right now?
2007-03-04T12:44:00.000Z	mytruehero	IndyGunFreak	yes
2007-03-04T12:45:00.000Z	mytruehero	IndyGunFreak	np :)
2007-03-04T12:46:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mytruehero	is nothing working, or is some things working and others not?
2007-03-04T12:47:00.000Z	mytruehero	IndyGunFreak	I'm following this tutorial ( https://help.ubuntu.com/community/KVM ), and it says "Install the 'kvm' package", but that package is not in any of my repositories
2007-03-04T12:47:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mytruehero	ok.. then you prolly need to add it, hang on
2007-03-04T12:48:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mytruehero	well, you could try adding that feisty repo to your 6.10 install, see what happens.
2007-03-04T12:49:00.000Z	mytruehero	IndyGunFreak	Ok; how do I tell which repository it's in?
2007-03-04T12:50:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mytruehero	actuyally, id on't think that would be a good idea..
2007-03-04T12:51:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mytruehero	that tutorial on Feisty, looks like its gonna require you to install Qemu(like VMwareplayer), and Windows on top of LInux, then use the Emulated Windows to control the switch
2007-03-04T12:52:00.000Z	mytruehero	IndyGunFreak	Hrm, ok. All I'm trying to do is get Windows running within Ubuntu. Is there a decent way to do it in 6.10?
2007-03-04T12:52:00.000Z	mytruehero	IndyGunFreak	ok
