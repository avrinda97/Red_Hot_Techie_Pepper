2011-10-28T21:39:00.000Z	hewwo		I'm on Ubuntu 11.10, and there doesn't seem to be any way for me to change my dimness settings (on a laptop). What gives? The screen keeps dimming even when I'm on AC power....
2011-10-28T21:40:00.000Z	lion42	hewwo	I'm not using 11.10 so I'm not -certain- of this, but do you see a power icon in your upper righthand toolbar?
2011-10-28T21:40:00.000Z	hewwo		yes
2011-10-28T21:40:00.000Z	lion42		Okay, what happens when you right or left click it?
2011-10-28T21:41:00.000Z	hewwo	lion42	A menu comes up with the option to go to the Power Settings. I've been there. All I can change is 1) Suspend when inactive for, 2) When the lid is closed, and 3) When power is critically low. There are NO options for or extra tabs or anything that will let me decide what to do when the laptop is idle.
2011-10-28T21:42:00.000Z	lion42	hewwo	is there no checkbox for "dim display when idle"?
2011-10-28T21:42:00.000Z	hewwo		nope
2011-10-28T21:42:00.000Z	hewwo	lion42	nope.
2011-10-28T21:43:00.000Z	lion42	hewwo	how odd. Sorry, if I had 11.10 I'd try to figure out what it was...
2011-10-28T21:43:00.000Z	lion42		Hopefully someone else can help you...
2011-10-28T21:43:00.000Z	hewwo	lion42	it is odd. here's proof just so we both can get peace of mind ;) ----- http://images.cjb.net/c537a.png
2011-10-28T21:44:00.000Z	lion42	hewwo	right. the option is present in gnome on 11.04, so that's just another feature they've decided you don't need I suppose.
2011-10-28T21:44:00.000Z	lion42		:P
2011-10-28T21:46:00.000Z	hewwo	lion42	understood. sad.... :(
2011-10-28T21:52:00.000Z	hewwo	lion42	Problem solved. There's a box to tick/untick in your SCREEN settings regarding auto-dimming. Looks like they moved it in 11.10. Thank you for your help, though!
2011-10-28T21:52:00.000Z	lion42		Sure, sorry I couldn't help.
2011-10-28T21:53:00.000Z	hewwo	lion42	Ain't no thang, mang. Is there a reason why you didn't upgrade to 11.10? (are there benefits to keeping an older version- this is the first time I'm using Ubuntu longer than for 2 days)
2011-10-28T21:54:00.000Z	lion42	hewwo	not really going the direction I want it to. Since there's no reason for me to upgrade...
2011-10-28T21:54:00.000Z	hewwo	lion42	right on. I get it.
