2011-08-09T10:59:00.000Z	a8nchs_burrito		when i debug stuff I usually run in Xmode
2011-08-09T11:00:00.000Z	a8nchs_burrito		that bashrc sucks.... it conflicts after over 1000 entries
2011-08-09T11:00:00.000Z	a8nchs_burrito		it will start mixmatching commands
2011-08-09T11:00:00.000Z	theadmin	a8nchs_burrito	You have no idea what you're talking about, do you?
2011-08-09T11:01:00.000Z	theadmin	a8nchs_burrito	I do, you don't. .bashrc is *just* a shellscript, executed on startup of bash.
2011-08-09T11:02:00.000Z	theadmin	a8nchs_burrito	It can't "conflict", unless you have written it wrongly.
2011-08-09T11:03:00.000Z	theadmin	a8nchs_burrito	You sure can, it'll just NOT run a script on bash startup then.
2011-08-09T11:04:00.000Z	theadmin	a8nchs_burrito	Well, you're just being silly.
2011-08-09T11:04:00.000Z	theadmin	a8nchs_burrito	Look, .bashrc is read on bash startup. .vimrc is read on vim startup, etc. That's what .*rc files are for.
2011-08-09T11:05:00.000Z	theadmin	a8nchs_burrito	Vim is Vi Improved.
2011-08-09T11:05:00.000Z	theadmin	a8nchs_burrito	Infact, plain vi is not even available in Ubuntu, it's all just Vim.
2011-08-09T11:12:00.000Z	theadmin	a8nchs_burrito	You're speaking nonsense again. It doesn't get in sendto, it doesn't do ANYTHING with purple apps at all.
2011-08-09T11:12:00.000Z	theadmin	a8nchs_burrito	Please stop this. Seriously now. You're being insanely offtopic.
2011-08-09T11:17:00.000Z	theadmin	a8nchs_burrito	pulseaudio is used by GNOME, and is the only soundsystem supported by Gnome3
2011-08-09T11:17:00.000Z	theadmin	a8nchs_burrito	Most other desktops use plain ALSA.
2011-08-09T11:18:00.000Z	theadmin	a8nchs_burrito	gstreamer is just a set of multimedia codecs or something like that.
2011-08-09T11:18:00.000Z	theadmin	a8nchs_burrito	It ain't a soundsystem.
2011-08-09T11:21:00.000Z	theadmin	a8nchs_burrito	If you need support with Gnome, IN UBUNTU, yes.
2011-08-09T11:23:00.000Z	theadmin	a8nchs_burrito	Gnome isn't the "controller" of Ubuntu, lolwut? It's just a desktop.
