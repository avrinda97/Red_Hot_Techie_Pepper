2010-05-03T02:00:00.000Z	Helpbuntu	undecim	Would you mind giving me a hand as well with a simple network issue?
2010-05-03T02:01:00.000Z	undecim	Helpbuntu	sure. I'll try to help both you and neverblue at the some time.
2010-05-03T02:02:00.000Z	Helpbuntu	undecim	Great, thank you! Long story short. I am working with netbook edition. Have been able to connect to the network before, but now I can't. Well it does say I am connected, but cannot ping the router, it is unreachable.
2010-05-03T02:03:00.000Z	undecim	Helpbuntu	What do you get when you type "route" into a terminal
2010-05-03T02:03:00.000Z	Helpbuntu	undecim	Looks like I am connected to an I.P. that is not my routers.
2010-05-03T02:08:00.000Z	undecim	Helpbuntu	sorry, missed your last message there for a minute... What is the first 2 numbers of the IP shown?
2010-05-03T02:09:00.000Z	Helpbuntu	undecim	no worries :) the numbers are 10
2010-05-03T02:10:00.000Z	Helpbuntu	undecim	I can ping it from the netbook but not from another computer.
2010-05-03T02:12:00.000Z	undecim	Helpbuntu	On the netbook that can ping... What are the first two numbers of the IP address it reports from the network manager?
2010-05-03T02:14:00.000Z	Helpbuntu	undecim	hmm something strange. Under /etc/network/interfaces it does not show
2010-05-03T02:14:00.000Z	Helpbuntu	undecim	hmm something strange. Under /etc/network/interfaces it does not show "eth1"
2010-05-03T02:15:00.000Z	undecim	Helpbuntu	Ethernet cards should start with eth0.
2010-05-03T02:16:00.000Z	Helpbuntu	undecim	ifconfig is showing 2. eth0 and eth1, which neither are located in that file.
2010-05-03T02:16:00.000Z	undecim	Helpbuntu	I think that network/interfaces is just for setting up static networking. Like for servers and stuff like that.
2010-05-03T02:17:00.000Z	Helpbuntu	undecim	oh
2010-05-03T02:18:00.000Z	Helpbuntu	undecim	but it should be listed
2010-05-03T02:20:00.000Z	undecim	Helpbuntu	No. Mine doesn't list my interfaces either and it's working fine
2010-05-03T02:20:00.000Z	Helpbuntu	undecim	hmm
2010-05-03T02:21:00.000Z	undecim	Helpbuntu	What are the first two numbers of the IP address that your working computer reports in the network manager?
