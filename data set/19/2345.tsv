2010-04-30T00:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Alket: its not faster, but can address more ram. Video and audio transforms will benefit too

2010-04-30T00:22:00.000Z	CaptainLucid	ActionParsnip	I assume the possiblity of things going wrong is increased?
2010-04-30T00:23:00.000Z	CaptainLucid	ActionParsnip	yeah, i thought so
2010-04-30T00:27:00.000Z	CaptainLucid	ActionParsnip	i did with 9.04, it still wouldn't stay persistent
2010-04-30T00:27:00.000Z	CaptainLucid	ActionParsnip	couldnt I just load 10.04 onto a 16Gb thumb drive as an opsys?
2010-04-30T00:28:00.000Z	CaptainLucid	ActionParsnip	i'm on a Ubu 9.04 system xD
2010-04-30T00:29:00.000Z	CaptainLucid	ActionParsnip	i don't want it to run the cd image off the drive xD
2010-04-30T00:31:00.000Z	CaptainLucid	ActionParsnip	doesn't that create a copy of the CD image?  i'm not in the mood to do that, i'd rather install it to the USB drive as the actual opsys...
2010-04-30T00:33:00.000Z	CaptainLucid	ActionParsnip	not available in Synaptic, I've got usb-creator tho
2010-04-30T00:34:00.000Z	CaptainLucid	ActionParsnip	thats what i've done, its had issues with it in past tho
