2008-02-02T08:43:00.000Z	osito	deahtihs	try Hardy, it has been working rather good with my broadcom card
2008-02-02T08:46:00.000Z	osito	deahtihs	do you know what exact card do you have?
2008-02-02T08:47:00.000Z	osito	deahtihs	as I said I've had a rather good wireless experience in Hardy
2008-02-02T08:47:00.000Z	osito	deahtihs	what lspci | grep etworking tell you
2008-02-02T08:48:00.000Z	osito	deahtihs	Applications -> Accesories -> Terminal type the following "lspci | grep etworking" no quotes and hit enter
2008-02-02T08:50:00.000Z	osito	deahtihs	check out what ubotu just "said"
2008-02-02T08:51:00.000Z	osito	deahtihs	read it from start to end :) not much else to do
2008-02-02T08:53:00.000Z	osito	deahtihs	as I said in Hardy the broadcom chips "just work"
2008-02-02T08:54:00.000Z	osito	deahtihs	yes, I've been using it since alpha1 without much of a hitch whatsoever
