2012-10-24T07:02:00.000Z	jarray52		My speaker stopped working on my Ubuntu 10.04 install. Now, I don't have any sound. Any suggestions?
2012-10-24T07:02:00.000Z	loadid	jarray52	reboot
2012-10-24T07:03:00.000Z	jarray52	loadid	That doesn't fix the problem.
2012-10-24T07:03:00.000Z	loadid		have you changed anything since it's stopped working jarray52?
2012-10-24T07:04:00.000Z	jarray52		I'm not sure. It stopped working a couple of weeks ago.
2012-10-24T07:04:00.000Z	loadid	jarray52	type alsamixer in a console
2012-10-24T07:04:00.000Z	loadid		are all the volumes turned up
2012-10-24T07:05:00.000Z	jarray52	loadid	I typed alsamixer and turned all volumes up.
2012-10-24T07:07:00.000Z	jarray52	loadid	All volumes are turned up.
2012-10-24T07:08:00.000Z	loadid		does your volume work jarray52?
2012-10-24T07:08:00.000Z	jarray52	loadid	No
2012-10-24T07:08:00.000Z	loadid		install pavucontrol
2012-10-24T07:08:00.000Z	jarray52		pavucontrol is already the newest.
2012-10-24T07:08:00.000Z	loadid		open pavucontrol
2012-10-24T07:09:00.000Z	jarray52	loadid	okay. It's opened.
2012-10-24T07:09:00.000Z	loadid		play around in there and see if it turns on, maybe in the profiles section
2012-10-24T07:13:00.000Z	loadid		try another version Jagst3r15, maybe nvidia-96
2012-10-24T07:13:00.000Z	jarray52	loadid	I opened pavucontrol and tried all the profile options under configuration.
2012-10-24T07:14:00.000Z	jarray52	loadid	None of them help with audio.
