2007-12-19T05:11:00.000Z	anathematic		how do i go about removing apache2 off my ubuntu server?
2007-12-19T05:12:00.000Z	bruce89	anathematic	sudo aptitude remove apache2 surely
2007-12-19T05:12:00.000Z	anathematic	bruce89	what if it was complied from source?
2007-12-19T05:12:00.000Z	bruce89		ah
2007-12-19T05:13:00.000Z	bruce89	anathematic	sudo make uninstall
2007-12-19T05:13:00.000Z	anathematic	bruce89	sorry, where do i preform t hat command?
2007-12-19T05:13:00.000Z	bruce89		hopefully you still have the source
2007-12-19T05:13:00.000Z	bruce89	anathematic	in the apache2's source directory
2007-12-19T05:14:00.000Z	anathematic	bruce89	so /etc/apache2/ right? (sorry not too familiar with this)
2007-12-19T05:14:00.000Z	bruce89	anathematic	I assume you installed it with sudo make install
2007-12-19T05:15:00.000Z	anathematic	bruce89	yes but a while ago
2007-12-19T05:15:00.000Z	bruce89	anathematic	and I assume you still have the apache2 source
2007-12-19T05:15:00.000Z	anathematic	bruce89	probably not
2007-12-19T05:15:00.000Z	bruce89	anathematic	if not, it's probably not possible
2007-12-19T05:15:00.000Z	anathematic		:<
2007-12-19T05:15:00.000Z	anathematic		thanks =)
2007-12-19T05:15:00.000Z	bruce89	anathematic	unless you redownload it
2007-12-19T05:15:00.000Z	bruce89	anathematic	I've hardly compiled from source though, so I don't really know
2007-12-19T05:16:00.000Z	anathematic	bruce89	it's no problem, i might just see if i can enable these modules not without compiling from source again
