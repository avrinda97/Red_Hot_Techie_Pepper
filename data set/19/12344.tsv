2006-12-27T10:28:00.000Z	Riyonuk		I cant seem to open a .rar
2006-12-27T10:28:00.000Z	Riyonuk		It keeps saying "Archive type not supported"
2006-12-27T10:29:00.000Z	Riyonuk		So why can I open .rar files in ubuntu?
2006-12-27T10:29:00.000Z	jpjacobs	Riyonuk	try installing rar-nonfree
2006-12-27T10:30:00.000Z	jpjacobs	Riyonuk	it's in apt (the multiverse repo i think)
2006-12-27T10:31:00.000Z	Riyonuk	jpjacobs	thanks, Ill look
2006-12-27T10:37:00.000Z	jpjacobs	Riyonuk	tried it in a new console?
2007-01-07T15:15:00.000Z	jpjacobs	Riyonuk	it means apt is already working
2007-01-07T15:16:00.000Z	jpjacobs	Riyonuk	it can be updatemanager, working in the background. use ps ax|egrep (apt|dpkg) to see wheter apt or dpkg is running
2007-01-07T15:17:00.000Z	jpjacobs	Riyonuk	you can kill a proces with kill <pid> (pid found with ps)
2007-01-07T15:18:00.000Z	Riyonuk	jpjacobs	I get 4 numbers
2007-01-07T15:19:00.000Z	Riyonuk	jpjacobs	so no what?

2007-01-07T15:22:00.000Z	Riyonuk	jpjacobs	its not working "kill <pid> 4827
2007-01-07T15:24:00.000Z	jpjacobs	Riyonuk	got them killed?
2007-01-07T15:30:00.000Z	Riyonuk	jpjacobs	so how exactly do I kill it?
2007-01-07T15:30:00.000Z	Riyonuk	jpjacobs	no, I dont know how
2007-01-07T15:31:00.000Z	jpjacobs	Riyonuk	so you got the process id's out of the ps thing right? now just do sudo kill number1 number2 ....
