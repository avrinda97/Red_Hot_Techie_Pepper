2009-09-08T07:27:00.000Z	shamm		looks like I will need to download ubuntu 32bit
2009-09-08T07:27:00.000Z	shamm		*sigh*
2009-09-08T07:27:00.000Z	Ben64	shamm	why do you want 190 so bad?
2009-09-08T07:28:00.000Z	shamm	Ben64	none of nvidia works for my 64bit
2009-09-08T07:28:00.000Z	Ben64	shamm	thats not true, i have nvidia and 64bit
2009-09-08T07:29:00.000Z	shamm	Ben64	I used envyng, xubuntu's hardware drivers, it kept screwing up my screen and froze the system.
2009-09-08T07:29:00.000Z	shamm	Ben64	server-64?
2009-09-08T07:29:00.000Z	Ben64	shamm	envy isn't xubuntu's hardware drivers
2009-09-08T07:29:00.000Z	shamm	Ben64	I know... I used xubuntu's hardware drivers FIRST
2009-09-08T07:30:00.000Z	Ben64	shamm	what cpu, ubuntu version, graphics card?
2009-09-08T07:31:00.000Z	Ben64	shamm	do you have server on a laptop?
2009-09-08T07:32:00.000Z	shamm	Ben64	testing platform before I deploy on actual server at work.
2009-09-08T07:32:00.000Z	Ben64	shamm	then .... nvidia drivers shouldn't matter
2009-09-08T07:32:00.000Z	shamm	Ben64	I agree that it shouldn't matter -- ubuntu's default nvidia drivers was those that froze my screen.
2009-09-08T07:33:00.000Z	Ben64	shamm	i'm just saying, i bet you'd have better luck with a non-server version on a laptop
2009-09-08T07:34:00.000Z	Ben64	shamm	and servers don't need graphics, especially hardware acceleration
2009-09-08T07:35:00.000Z	shamm	Ben64	ok -- I'll create a dual for that then.
2009-09-08T07:36:00.000Z	Ben64	shamm	good luck, x64 is great btw :)
2009-09-08T07:36:00.000Z	shamm	Ben64	I agree!
