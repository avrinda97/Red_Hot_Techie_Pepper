2006-12-09T06:58:00.000Z	umgan		i am having a problem with a missing icon that should point to a newly formatted and mounted drive.  i am using edgy and have added the drive to fstab.  The drive works perfectly but is missing its icon
2006-12-09T06:59:00.000Z	kitche	umgan	what do you mean by icon?
2006-12-09T07:00:00.000Z	umgan	kitche	since i mounted the newly formatted partition there is no icon in either place
2006-12-09T07:00:00.000Z	umgan	kitche	the drive mounted and working however...
2006-12-09T07:01:00.000Z	kitche	umgan	did you check /media?
2006-12-09T07:02:00.000Z	umgan	kitche	the drive is /media/hda1 and it works fine...i can read and write...just no icon shows up for it on the desktop or places-->computer
2006-12-09T07:06:00.000Z	umgan	kitche	any thoughts?
2006-12-09T07:07:00.000Z	kitche	umgan	open up gconf-editor then go to /apps/nautilus/desktop and there should be a spot for icons
2006-12-09T07:08:00.000Z	umgan	kitche	i went there and the volumes icons are checked on...however that volume is still missing
2006-12-09T07:09:00.000Z	kitche	umgan	hmm that is odd
2006-12-09T07:09:00.000Z	umgan	kitche	well i formatted this drive...it was ntfs and it did show up...i formatted it to ext3 and used fstab to get it permanently mounted....but it wont show a volume icon for it
2006-12-09T07:10:00.000Z	kitche	umgan	and you did sudo mount -a?
2006-12-09T07:10:00.000Z	umgan	kitche	yep
2006-12-09T07:11:00.000Z	umgan	kitche	randakar ran me through getting it mounted yeterday
2006-12-09T07:12:00.000Z	kitche	umgan	hmm type mount and see if htat drive is indeed mounted
2006-12-09T07:12:00.000Z	umgan	kitche	/dev/hda1 on /media/hda1 type ext3 (rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev,errors=remount-ro)
