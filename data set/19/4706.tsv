2009-04-04T08:01:00.000Z	gasull		Hi.  I run out of free HD space in my main partition.  This is weird.  /tmp and /home use other partitions.  How can I find why I run out of space?
2009-04-04T08:01:00.000Z	musikgoat|main	gasull	graphically applications -> accessories -> disk space analyzer
2009-04-04T08:02:00.000Z	gasull	musikgoat|main	thanks.  I can't run X
2009-04-04T08:03:00.000Z	musikgoat|main	gasull	sorry, then i would suggest du -h --max-depth=1
2009-04-04T08:04:00.000Z	musikgoat|main	gasull	then you can traverse down the folders that are the culprits
2009-04-04T08:04:00.000Z	musikgoat|main	gasull	you may want to do it as root though
2009-04-04T08:14:00.000Z	gasull	musikgoat|main	psywiped Huufarted: 5.7G /var, 7.6G /usr .  Should I empty /var?  How?
2009-04-04T08:15:00.000Z	musikgoat|main	gasull	your apt cache could be taking up alot of space
2009-04-04T08:16:00.000Z	musikgoat|main	gasull	you can run sudo apt-get clean
2009-04-04T08:16:00.000Z	musikgoat|main	gasull	then check the size of /var
2009-04-04T08:16:00.000Z	gasull	musikgoat|main	OK.  Thanks
2009-04-04T08:17:00.000Z	gasull	musikgoat|main	It changed from 5.7G to 5.6G
2009-04-04T08:18:00.000Z	musikgoat|main	gasull	hmm then something else is it up,  change your du command to /var  instead of /
2009-04-04T08:18:00.000Z	musikgoat|main	gasull	and work your way down to determine what sub directory is the culprit
2009-04-04T08:20:00.000Z	gasull	musikgoat|main	I see the problem now: /var/backup and /var/backups.  I was using sbackup for trying to back up my system, unsuccessfully
2009-04-04T08:20:00.000Z	musikgoat|main	gasull	ahh, then delete what you need to :-)
2009-04-04T08:20:00.000Z	gasull	musikgoat|main	I will just delete those directories
2009-04-04T08:20:00.000Z	gasull	musikgoat|main	Thanks a lot :-)
2009-04-04T08:25:00.000Z	musikgoat|main	gasull	upgrades can be troublesome sometimes, but mostly, 8.04 -> 8.10 is painless
