2008-08-08T08:32:00.000Z	jay_		<--- new ubuntu user from windows, tried both Xchat and Koversation, which one is best for irc and why?
2008-08-08T08:32:00.000Z	jay_		how do you use proxy in xchat?
2008-08-08T08:33:00.000Z	jay_		like i mirc i could use a socks5
2008-08-08T08:33:00.000Z	Flannel	jay_	If you're using Ubuntu, xchat is better than Konversation because you're already using the GUI libraries for gnome

2008-08-08T08:45:00.000Z	Flannel	jay_	yeah, linux doesn't differentiate between "desktop" and "server" they're just programs that run
2008-08-08T08:46:00.000Z	Flannel	jay_	. means your current directory, so ./blah would call "blah" in your current directory.  By default your current directory isn't included in the path (where it looks for commands) for security
2008-08-08T08:48:00.000Z	Flannel	jay_	sudo mkdir blah
2008-08-08T08:50:00.000Z	Flannel	jay_	Its a lot to absorb at first, but it'll get easier
2008-08-08T08:52:00.000Z	Flannel	jay_	Generally they won't have an extension
2008-08-08T08:53:00.000Z	Flannel	jay_	Not all of them, theres a few directories that'll house stuff.  You can tell where something is with the "which" command,  "which blah" will give you the path to blah
2008-08-08T08:55:00.000Z	Flannel	jay_	Don't feel bad when, in a few weeks, you want to reinstall to get rid of all the stuff you broke while playing.  I think I went through at least a dozen.

2008-08-08T09:16:00.000Z	Flannel	jay_	If you install from the server CD, there isn't anything "past" the command prompt
2008-08-08T09:17:00.000Z	Flannel	jay_	sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
2008-08-08T09:17:00.000Z	Flannel	jay_	and you'll probably also want to install linux-generic
2008-08-08T09:18:00.000Z	Flannel	jay_	"real linux" isn't about targz or compiling.
2008-08-08T09:26:00.000Z	Flannel	jay_	apache2, but yes.
