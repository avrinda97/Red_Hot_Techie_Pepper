2012-06-08T00:47:00.000Z	tuxgeek	iulix	is it a dual boot?
2012-06-08T00:47:00.000Z	iulix		as for wireless, when I go to settings>network and turn on the wireless button, its turning back off instantly
2012-06-08T00:48:00.000Z	iulix		if you mean that I have a dual boot system, then yes (win and ubuntu), but I think you mean something else?!
2012-06-08T00:48:00.000Z	tuxgeek		no I don't
2012-06-08T00:48:00.000Z	tuxgeek		I think you have problems with the wireless driver
