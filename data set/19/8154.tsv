2007-05-27T15:04:00.000Z	Dexter	sahil	the very same problem persists even using wvdial
2007-05-27T15:04:00.000Z	Dexter		I've explained the problem in details here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=2728767#post2728767
2007-05-27T15:04:00.000Z	sahil		Is ur model connection configured?
2007-05-27T15:04:00.000Z	Dexter		yes
2007-05-27T15:04:00.000Z	sahil		going there now
2007-05-27T15:04:00.000Z	Dexter		it worked great in Edgy
2007-05-27T15:05:00.000Z	Dexter		and works perfectly in Widnows XP
2007-05-27T15:05:00.000Z	Dexter		since I've upgraded to Feisty it is worked anymore :|
2007-05-27T15:07:00.000Z	sahil		Dexter when did this problem occur, and did you make any changes to anything b4 it stopped
2007-05-27T15:08:00.000Z	Dexter	sahil	no, nothing.. I just installed Feisty from scratch, then installed Gnome-PPP and I started having the problem
2007-05-27T15:08:00.000Z	Dexter	sahil	but with Edgy, no problems at all
2007-05-27T15:09:00.000Z	sahil		Dexter maybe you need some restricted driver on Fiesty ?
2007-05-27T15:10:00.000Z	Dexter	sahil	Mh, How can I see if I need it or not? My modem is a serial US Robotics Sportster flash
2007-05-27T15:10:00.000Z	Dexter	sahil	i didn't know i needed restricted drivers for old school serial  modems
2007-05-27T15:10:00.000Z	sahil	Dexter	neither did I and i doubt you do if it worked with Eddy
2007-05-27T15:11:00.000Z	Dexter		Sahil, yeah :( In edgy it worked like a charm, and now since I've no internet on Feisty, i'm forced on my windows machine -_-
2007-05-27T15:13:00.000Z	sahil		Dexter  did it EVER work with Fiesty ?
2007-05-27T15:15:00.000Z	Dexter	sahil	NO, since I installed Feisty I always had that problem
