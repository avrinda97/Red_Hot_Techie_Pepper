2006-06-10T07:26:00.000Z	SurfnKid	eggzeck	ive added AIM and logs in. but ICQ returns an error
2006-06-10T07:27:00.000Z	eggzeck	SurfnKid	All you need to do is enter your ICQ number where it says screen name
2006-06-10T07:27:00.000Z	eggzeck	SurfnKid	When adding an account
2006-06-10T07:27:00.000Z	SurfnKid	eggzeck	exactly thats what i thought
2006-06-10T07:27:00.000Z	SurfnKid	eggzeck	ive got an account from back in 95.  My other XP laptop still has it running, recently reinstalled it too. so not sure why i cant here
2006-06-10T07:28:00.000Z	eggzeck	SurfnKid	Did you try adding a new account to gaim? Click on "Accounts", then "Add", where it says "Screen Name", put your ICQ number, then password and alias :)
2006-06-10T07:29:00.000Z	SurfnKid	eggzeck	i followed exactly that for all my other msn, yho, AIM account and they all log in.  maybe i need to check at the icq page or something. but its weird i cant connect
2006-06-10T07:30:00.000Z	SurfnKid	eggzeck	its strange
2006-06-10T07:30:00.000Z	eggzeck	SurfnKid	What's the error?
2006-06-10T07:31:00.000Z	eggzeck	SurfnKid	Then make sure they're correct. I'm on ICQ now with Gaim
2006-06-10T07:31:00.000Z	SurfnKid	eggzeck	i think ill do that, you're right
