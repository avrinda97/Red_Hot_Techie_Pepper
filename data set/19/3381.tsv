2010-05-07T08:52:00.000Z	JoshDreamland	dark-knight	Does it respond to key presses?
2010-05-07T08:52:00.000Z	dark-knight	JoshDreamland	nope it doesn't respond to anything but turning it off.
2010-05-07T08:52:00.000Z	JoshDreamland	dark-knight	Including ctrl-alt-f2?
2010-05-07T08:53:00.000Z	JoshDreamland	dark-knight	and ctrl-alt-delete?
2010-05-07T08:53:00.000Z	dark-knight	JoshDreamland	yes, nothing happens when trying to go to a virtual terminal or ctrl alt delete. it does not respond to anything, it just sits at the black screen, although my wireless card shows it is working, and the little lights on the bottom show it is thinking, but i see/can't react with anything

2010-05-07T08:55:00.000Z	JoshDreamland	dark-knight	Who's your card manufacturer?
2010-05-07T08:58:00.000Z	JoshDreamland	dark-knight	I meant your graphics card.
2010-05-07T09:00:00.000Z	JoshDreamland	dark-knight	how sure are you?
2010-05-07T09:00:00.000Z	JoshDreamland	dark-knight	does lsmod | grep intel-agp print anything?
2010-05-07T09:04:00.000Z	JoshDreamland	dark-knight	if it prints anything at all when you ask for intel-agp it means it's running some sort of intel chip
2010-05-07T09:07:00.000Z	JoshDreamland	dark-knight	So it's a PCI-enabled intel card. Terrific.
2010-05-07T09:10:00.000Z	JoshDreamland	dark-knight	I guess if we want to see what -does- work, you could try running it from with quiet3
2010-05-07T09:10:00.000Z	JoshDreamland	dark-knight	just add quiet3 to your parameters, and change splash to nosplash
2010-05-07T09:11:00.000Z	JoshDreamland	dark-knight	in GRUB, before it boots, press F6 to edit the boot params. Change quiet to quiet3 and splash to nosplash.
2010-05-07T09:12:00.000Z	JoshDreamland	dark-knight	It'll show us that the OS works if it doesn't need to start graphics, for one
2010-05-07T09:13:00.000Z	JoshDreamland	dark-knight	it'll also give you access to the computer, of course.
