2010-01-06T05:11:00.000Z	Tayl		How do I run 'et-linux-2.55.x86.run'?
2010-01-06T05:12:00.000Z	acicula	Tayl	chmod +x and then add a ./before the name
2010-01-06T05:13:00.000Z	Tayl	acicula	It says no file or directory? =s
2010-01-06T05:16:00.000Z	acicula	Tayl	no news = good news in unix
2010-01-06T05:31:00.000Z	acicula	Tayl	the gtk from the version to old?
2010-01-06T05:31:00.000Z	Tayl	acicula	downloaded it from the recommended website on the forum too.
2010-01-06T05:34:00.000Z	Tayl	acicula	http://packages.ubuntu.com/jaunty/libgtk1.2 - Grabbed it from there via the link at the bottom but it just won't run?
2010-01-06T05:34:00.000Z	Tayl	acicula	Not really sure what to do with the file once I've downloaded it (a bit of a beginner, I am).
2010-01-06T05:35:00.000Z	acicula	Tayl	pretty sure apt-get install libgtk will give you a version that works though
2010-01-06T05:36:00.000Z	acicula	Tayl	hmm seems karmic only has libgtk2.0-0
2010-01-06T05:37:00.000Z	Tayl	acicula	I need an older version, I think?
2010-01-06T05:38:00.000Z	acicula	Tayl	dunno tbh, you could try the older package and see if you can get around the dependency issues
2010-01-06T05:38:00.000Z	Tayl	acicula	How do I install the older package?
2010-01-06T05:39:00.000Z	acicula	Tayl	double click on the package in the file browser
2010-01-06T05:40:00.000Z	Tayl	acicula	Tried, that's when I get 'Error: Dependency is not satisfiable: libglib1.2ldbl (>= 1.2.10-18)'
2010-01-06T05:42:00.000Z	acicula	Tayl	yeah i only see libglib2.0-0
2010-01-06T05:42:00.000Z	Tayl	acicula	AI, on the forum said "If you check the dependency list of libgtk1.2 on the site, you'll see where to get'em", to a member that was having the same problem.
2010-01-06T05:43:00.000Z	Tayl	acicula	Not really sure where he's referring too?
2010-01-06T05:43:00.000Z	acicula	Tayl	to grab the deb of that glib package as well and install it
