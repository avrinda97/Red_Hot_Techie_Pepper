2006-07-14T15:18:00.000Z	C|int		hey guys, do you know if the xserver-xgl, xgl in general, would work on an Acer Aspire 3610, I just installed recent ubuntu lately, and from the nice package I got in mail, I was really busy in my 3d cad, and Adobe Software, on windows , also, I did get VMware Workstation latest installed, also an upgrade I did from 5.0 which works really good on ubuntu, however I know that XGL might help a bit :P
2006-07-14T15:19:00.000Z	C|int		and also btw, its a sucker for my wireless, but I'f I have too, I am going replace the mini pci, wireless broadcom, with atheros probably :P
2006-07-14T15:19:00.000Z	Subhuman	C|int	what graphics card does it have?
2006-07-14T15:19:00.000Z	Subhuman	C|int	you can use broadcom cards
2006-07-14T15:19:00.000Z	Subhuman	C|int	you just have to get the firmware for it, ive done it on two of my machines
2006-07-14T15:20:00.000Z	Subhuman	C|int	did for me, did the md5 fail? cuz i have a working link for one.
2006-07-14T15:20:00.000Z	Subhuman	C|int	yes same as mine
2006-07-14T15:25:00.000Z	Subhuman	C|int	what card do you have then? is it ati or nv? cuz if itz nv > 4200 then your good to go with XGL
2006-07-14T15:26:00.000Z	Subhuman	C|int	the intel 915 gma
2006-07-14T15:27:00.000Z	Subhuman	C|int	i THINK the onboard intels work, no harm in trying, best asking at #ubuntu-xgl tho to be 100% sure
2006-07-14T15:29:00.000Z	Subhuman	C|int	i dont have myspace dude.
2006-07-14T15:40:00.000Z	Subhuman	C|int	the alt. install CD only allows you to install grub in an alternative location, apart from that it is basicaly identical to the live install.
2006-07-14T15:40:00.000Z	Subhuman	C|int	i know as i have done full installs with both, and the server.
2006-07-14T15:41:00.000Z	Subhuman	C|int	ive ran 5-6 OS's on one machine, and the live partitioner is better.
2006-07-14T15:43:00.000Z	Subhuman	C|int	ive done both, look on the ubuntu forums
2006-07-14T15:44:00.000Z	Subhuman	C|int	you can do it with a broadcom.
2006-07-14T06:08:00.000Z	Subhuman	C|int	noone thinks that, ive opened up laptops on my carpet before with no issues.
2006-07-14T06:09:00.000Z	Subhuman	C|int	when my sisters AC plug snapped off inside, i jus ripped it open and soldered it back on.
