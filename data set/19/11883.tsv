2005-11-06T16:52:00.000Z	Lajuj		does anyone know why ubuntu breezy would not be detecting my wireless cart?
2005-11-06T16:52:00.000Z	bob2	Lajuj	you need to tell us what sort of card it is, and define "detecting"
2005-11-06T16:53:00.000Z	Lajuj	bob2	ipw2100, and when I got to networking I only see 1 ethernet card and no choice to add another
2005-11-06T16:55:00.000Z	bob2	Lajuj	"got to networking" = "using some gnome configuration tool"? ignore it.
2005-11-06T16:55:00.000Z	bob2	Lajuj	what does "lsmod | grep ipw2" print?
2005-11-06T16:56:00.000Z	Lajuj	bob2	it prints nothing in the terminal
2005-11-06T16:58:00.000Z	Lajuj	bob2	it prints nothing in the terminal
2005-11-06T16:58:00.000Z	bob2	Lajuj	sudo modprobe ipw2100
2005-11-06T16:58:00.000Z	Lajuj	bob2	again, nada
2005-11-06T16:58:00.000Z	bob2	Lajuj	that won't print anything
2005-11-06T16:59:00.000Z	Lajuj	bob2	nope, I enter the text and it just gives me robert@chay~$
2005-11-06T16:59:00.000Z	bob2	Lajuj	what? modprobe does not print anything.
2005-11-06T16:59:00.000Z	bob2	Lajuj	unless it failed
2005-11-06T16:59:00.000Z	bob2	Lajuj	now run lsmod | grep ipw again
2005-11-07T17:00:00.000Z	Lajuj	bob2	now I getipw2100                78896  0
2005-11-07T17:05:00.000Z	Lajuj	bob2	it seems when I grep ipw it detects something
2005-11-07T17:08:00.000Z	bob2	Lajuj	now try setting it up
2005-11-07T17:08:00.000Z	Lajuj	bob2	what do you mean by setting it up?
2005-11-07T17:09:00.000Z	bob2	Lajuj	nevermind then
