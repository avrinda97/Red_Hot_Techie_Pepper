2011-09-10T07:47:00.000Z	rallias		umm... I have a wicked issue... I installed via the alternate cd and gave it the wifi info off the bat, and now it configures wifi access, but not dns... how can I fix this?
2011-09-10T07:49:00.000Z	rallias		how would I get it to default to using network manager rather then whatever its using internally?
2011-09-10T07:50:00.000Z	urlin2u	rallias	remove the wifi in network manager or edit the dhcp to automatic
2011-09-10T07:51:00.000Z	urlin2u	rallias	remove and rerun the setup of course.
2011-09-10T07:51:00.000Z	rallias	urlin2u	I'm sorry if I'm not being understood. Network-manager refuses to touch my wifi
2011-09-10T07:51:00.000Z	urlin2u	rallias	if you open it or click on the Icon you don't see the wireless signal?
2011-09-10T07:52:00.000Z	urlin2u	rallias	is the wireless you set up showing in the network managers  edit-connections wireless?
2011-09-10T07:54:00.000Z	urlin2u	rallias	does the signal show when you left click the icon and get the drop down?
2011-09-10T07:54:00.000Z	urlin2u	rallias	what is the release installed?
2011-09-10T07:55:00.000Z	urlin2u	rallias	can you ethernet plug it?
2011-09-10T07:56:00.000Z	urlin2u	rallias	that would probably kick it I'm not familiar with any other ways than mentioned.
2011-09-10T07:57:00.000Z	rallias	urlin2u	I've encountered the problem before, and I know that the file is in here somewhere, and it causes iwconfig to configure, but I can't google what that file is without dns...
2011-09-10T07:59:00.000Z	urlin2u	rallias	the sudo gedit /etc/resolv.conf is the network manager file.
2011-09-10T08:00:00.000Z	rallias	urlin2u	network-manager refuses to touch my wifi card because something else inside claimed control of it.
2011-09-10T08:03:00.000Z	urlin2u	rallias	is it a broadcom card perchance?
2011-09-10T08:03:00.000Z	rallias	urlin2u	no thats a different laptop of mine.
2011-09-10T08:04:00.000Z	urlin2u	rallias	was just wondering if it actually ever reached the net to begin with, and is a driver problem.
2011-09-10T08:04:00.000Z	rallias	urlin2u	it was /etc/network/interfaces
2011-09-10T08:04:00.000Z	urlin2u	rallias	cool baby. :D
