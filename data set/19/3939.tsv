2009-05-04T08:23:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tkt	Ext3 is fine for most  Linux users,  just  us  people that have been using  Linux for years,  want to try different file systems and such
2009-05-04T08:23:00.000Z	tkt	sebsebseb	what is the advantage of ext4, and isn't it still under development?
2009-05-04T08:23:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tkt	faster  disk checking,  better with bigger files, and I think that's about it really
2009-05-04T08:24:00.000Z	tkt	sebsebseb	i see, thank you
2009-05-04T08:24:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tkt	plus someone just said  faster disk checking can be done with Ext3 as well
2009-05-04T08:25:00.000Z	tkt	sebsebseb	i deal with files 5gb and larger on a regular basis.  Would i advantage by using ext4?
2009-05-04T08:27:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tkt	yes and no
2009-05-04T08:27:00.000Z	tkt	sebsebseb	lol, i will look into id =D
2009-05-04T08:27:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tkt	 Ext4  is not 100% stable yet, there are 3 issues mentioend in the release notes etc
2009-05-04T08:27:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tkt	well the Grub issue is probably really Grub's fault

2009-05-04T08:29:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tkt	 if you set up the partitions your self  no newbie guided install
2009-05-04T08:29:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tkt	if you do it yourself quite a few file systems you can choose from
2009-05-04T08:30:00.000Z	tkt	sebsebseb	well is it just ubuntu that is doing using ext4? becuase i use debian but i hang out here because the debian channel sucks
2009-05-04T08:31:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tkt	nope  Fedora 11 which is currently in development will have  Ext4  as an option or mabye even the default
