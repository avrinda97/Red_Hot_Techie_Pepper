2008-07-13T21:23:00.000Z	sdakak	ActionParsnip	Does running Photoshop CS2 in wine in wine or cedega or in vbox feel different? Results in vbox were pathetic.

2008-07-13T21:31:00.000Z	sdakak	ActionParsnip	Or the other way?
2008-07-13T21:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sdakak	no idea man, I only use native apps.
