2007-06-13T14:49:00.000Z	AdvoWork		or natsumey_ how do i set the users home dir to: /home/ftp from the command line?
2007-06-13T14:50:00.000Z	AdvoWork		as they get 500 Permission Denied
2007-06-13T14:50:00.000Z	Flannel	AdvoWork	usermod
2007-06-13T14:50:00.000Z	Flannel	AdvoWork	YOu're probably better off just adding them to an ftp group or something with write perms
2007-06-13T14:52:00.000Z	Flannel	AdvoWork	again, usermod.  Make sure you remember the -a
2007-06-13T14:55:00.000Z	Flannel	AdvoWork	no, there's more to it.  usermod -G group -a username or whatever.  man usermod will give you all the gorey details
2007-06-13T14:56:00.000Z	Flannel	AdvoWork	just don't forget the -a, since that causes problems
2007-06-13T15:03:00.000Z	Flannel	AdvoWork	Looks like it, yes.
2007-06-13T15:06:00.000Z	Flannel	AdvoWork	500 error?  That's through a webbrowser?
2007-06-13T15:07:00.000Z	Flannel	AdvoWork	and when you do it locally it works?
2007-06-13T15:08:00.000Z	Flannel	AdvoWork	right, but testuser, when logged in via ssh, can or cannot create a folder?
2007-06-13T15:12:00.000Z	Flannel	AdvoWork	Right.  We're seeing if the error is because the user has problems, or because of something with ftping
2007-06-13T15:13:00.000Z	Flannel	AdvoWork	Just connect through some other means.  either ssh, or locally walk up and login.
2009-06-25T13:40:00.000Z	Flannel	AdvoWork	lock the root account.
2009-06-25T13:40:00.000Z	Flannel	AdvoWork	sudoers is a bit more complicated to edit than I'd feel comfortable just giving you the command for (since knowing what youre doing is important), *luckily* we have some decent documentation: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Sudoers
2009-06-25T13:41:00.000Z	Flannel	AdvoWork	Read through it, and let us know what questions you have (and if you're still unsure, you can always verify lines you want to add in this channel).
2009-06-25T13:43:00.000Z	Flannel	AdvoWork	It's actually locked by default, did you unlock it?
2009-06-25T13:44:00.000Z	AdvoWork	Flannel	i didnt, but i think our external support did
2009-06-25T13:44:00.000Z	Flannel	AdvoWork	There's no such way to define such a thing.  "Anything" as far as being useful is concerned could easily be "destroying a server"
