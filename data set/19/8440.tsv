2007-04-04T07:57:00.000Z	karmax		hello, sorry for bother, maybe this is a kubuntu *only* problem, so sorry again. Im using kubuntu and after a fresh install i update everything with adept but it fails with libc6-i686 and fails and fails
2007-04-04T07:57:00.000Z	karmax		(kubuntu last version)
2007-04-04T07:58:00.000Z	dan20	karmax	what's the error it's giving when it fails
2007-04-04T08:02:00.000Z	karmax	dan20	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/13811/
2007-04-04T08:04:00.000Z	dan20	karmax	I'm not sure what this error is.  You're running apt-get as root, yes?
2007-04-04T08:05:00.000Z	karmax	dan20	yes... but in fact, i dont want to run apt-get.. i just want to click update on adept
2007-04-04T08:06:00.000Z	karmax	dan20	im a gentoo user, i installed ubuntu just to forget about dependency, distro or updates problems...
2007-04-04T08:06:00.000Z	dan20	karmax	well, adept is just a front end, it's still running the same command sin reality
2007-04-04T08:06:00.000Z	dan20	karmax	try apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade
2007-04-04T08:08:00.000Z	karmax	dan20	this kind of problems are normal in ubuntu?
2007-04-04T08:08:00.000Z	dan20	karmax	not at all, or I'd probably be able to help you more lol
2007-04-04T08:08:00.000Z	dan20	karmax	i can normally install ubuntu, update the system, install ATI drivers, and get everything running about as easily as I can in Windows XP Pro.
2007-04-04T08:09:00.000Z	karmax	dan20	i only install kubuntu *normal install, then run adept to update everything.. and thats it, an error with libc6-i686
2007-04-04T08:10:00.000Z	dan20	karmax	hmm.  It seems like a really random issue.  I don't use kde though, so I'm not up on adept issues (if this is an adept issue, which it probably isn't)
2007-04-04T08:10:00.000Z	dan20	karmax	I'm not expert in general, so someone else could probably help you better
2007-04-04T08:11:00.000Z	karmax	dan20	dont know... i dont know what to do to fix this broken status
2007-04-04T08:12:00.000Z	dan20	karmax	You're in a pretty early stage, if it was me I'd just reinstall.
2007-04-04T08:13:00.000Z	karmax	dan20	thanks, c ya
2007-04-04T08:13:00.000Z	dan20	karmax	np
