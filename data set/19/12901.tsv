2005-06-22T15:14:00.000Z	goye2cz		with qjackctl
2005-06-22T06:03:00.000Z	goye2cz		any way to test if I've correctly installed my tascam us-122
2005-06-22T06:03:00.000Z	goye2cz		?
2005-06-22T06:04:00.000Z	misaka	goye2cz	- I've got one of those ...
2005-06-22T06:05:00.000Z	goye2cz	misaka	appears to be.
2005-06-22T06:05:00.000Z	goye2cz	misaka	don't take my word for it, I don't have it working yet.
2005-06-22T06:06:00.000Z	misaka	goye2cz	- Well, wouldn't mind hearing if you end up sorting it out. ;] 
2005-06-22T06:07:00.000Z	goye2cz	misaka	this is the link to directions on how to install it: http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-30891.html The link to the RPM is broken, but someone here helped me find one.
2005-06-22T06:08:00.000Z	misaka	goye2cz	- Cool.
2005-06-22T07:34:00.000Z	misaka	goye2cz	- To start, alsa doesn't have a 'firmware' version ... just a version. :] 
2005-06-22T07:35:00.000Z	misaka	goye2cz	- And the other thing is that the package version, that you see with dpkg/synaptic, isn't necessarily the same as the kernel drivers version, that you see in /proc/asound/version.
2005-06-22T07:35:00.000Z	goye2cz	misaka	all I know is that's included in the name of somethign I have to have.
2005-06-22T07:36:00.000Z	misaka	goye2cz	- I've got the same setup you describe, 1.0.6 in /proc/asound/version, and 1.0.8-4ubuntu4 for the package version.
2005-06-22T07:40:00.000Z	goye2cz	misaka	on the ardour channel someone came to the conclusion that my package of alsa-firmware didn't support the us-122.
2005-06-22T07:54:00.000Z	misaka	goye2cz	- Sorry, I'm not sure how to update/change the alsa firmware package, I don't see it listed in ubuntu. Maybe it's a part of another package?
2005-06-22T07:56:00.000Z	goye2cz	misaka	I'm fast finding out that I really need a release more geared to multi-media, audio specifically.
2005-06-22T07:56:00.000Z	misaka	goye2cz	- If you're running Linux to do audio stuff, I'd agree.
2005-06-22T07:57:00.000Z	goye2cz	misaka	I'm getting recommended to use FC CCRMA
