2009-06-01T01:31:00.000Z	jake__		anyone have any insight on what would be causing this issue?
2009-06-01T01:31:00.000Z	jake__		it's getting really annoying, as i play online games, all of a sudden, boom.
2009-06-01T01:31:00.000Z	czajkowski	jake__	what verison are you using?
2009-06-01T01:32:00.000Z	jake__		9.04 Jaunty
2009-06-01T01:32:00.000Z	czajkowski	jake__	wifi there is pretty good. are you sure it's not your router acting up?
2009-06-01T01:32:00.000Z	jake__	czajkowski	positive, works fine on Windows.
2009-06-01T01:33:00.000Z	jake__	czajkowski	there's 9 computers here, all of them work fine without any issues, i even bought a new wireless card and it does the same :/
2009-06-01T01:33:00.000Z	czajkowski	jake__	did you have any issue under Intpreid or is this since you went to Jaunty?
2009-06-01T01:33:00.000Z	jake__	czajkowski	same issue on Intrepid too
2009-06-01T01:34:00.000Z	jake__	czajkowski	i formatted and reinstalled Jaunty, though.
2009-06-01T01:35:00.000Z	czajkowski	jake__	sounds like your card issue and not distro issue. I had an issue with realteck drivers have you looked at launchpad at the bugs to see if there is an issue, if not why not log a bug with all the inforation needed
2009-06-01T01:35:00.000Z	jake__	czajkowski	i'm using NETGEAR WPN111 - worked fine for ages
2009-06-01T01:35:00.000Z	jake__	czajkowski	and i've tried a PCI card, built for linux, same problem
2009-06-01T01:37:00.000Z	czajkowski	jake__	not sure so, sorry. I'd suggest eihter looking launhcpad at some of the bugs there and seeing if yours fits in somewhere, I do know the forums are also very useful.sorry not much hel
2009-06-01T01:37:00.000Z	czajkowski		*help
2009-06-01T01:38:00.000Z	jake__	czajkowski	no problem, thanks anyway :)
2009-06-01T01:48:00.000Z	jake__	czajkowski	my issue is the exact same as: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/132042
2009-06-01T01:51:00.000Z	czajkowski	jake__	cool so in your case I'd give all your pc information and like some folks did the output from your system, and point out what distro version you are using
