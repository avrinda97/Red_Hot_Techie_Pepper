2009-09-17T00:13:00.000Z	dragon		my display flickers every minute - it goes blank for about 2 seconds. Ideas?
2009-09-17T00:14:00.000Z	MarderIII	dragon	overheating?
2009-09-17T00:15:00.000Z	dragon	MarderIII	It's a new laptop, and it's cold. The external display (HDMI) is flickering; the laptop screen doesn't.
2009-09-17T00:17:00.000Z	MarderIII	dragon	checked connectors? got a similar problem a while back. connector got damaged by fall.
2009-09-17T00:18:00.000Z	dragon	MarderIII	I did; the connector seems fine too, and it's working well 98% of the time
2009-09-17T00:19:00.000Z	MarderIII	dragon	is interval between blanks constant?
2009-09-17T00:19:00.000Z	dragon	MarderIII	no
2009-09-17T00:20:00.000Z	dragon	MarderIII	the usual range is (1, 10) mins
2009-09-17T00:21:00.000Z	MarderIII	dragon	out of ideas.. :-( still seems to me as if something is "resetting"
2009-09-17T00:21:00.000Z	dragon	MarderIII	yes that's possible. dmesg log and syslog didn't have any info on this.
2009-09-17T00:21:00.000Z	dragon		and now it's flickering every 15 secs
2009-09-17T00:22:00.000Z	MarderIII	dragon	suspect electronic component.. no idea which one of course. absense of log messages seems to point to hardware too.
2009-09-17T00:23:00.000Z	dragon	MarderIII	makes sense
2009-09-17T00:23:00.000Z	dragon		!windows | sil3nt|warri0r
2009-09-17T00:24:00.000Z	dragon		No, I meant vista.
2009-09-17T00:24:00.000Z	MarderIII	dragon	can you connect another monitor? to see if its the monitor thats causing it?
2009-09-17T00:25:00.000Z	dragon	MarderIII	other monitor was doing something worse; this is the second one.
2009-09-17T00:27:00.000Z	MarderIII	dragon	it still could be the cable, but suspect your laptop has a defective (external) video interface. My condolences...
2009-09-17T00:28:00.000Z	dragon	MarderIII	different behavior with different monitors - i'm not sure what's the case. I'll call the tech support now :)
