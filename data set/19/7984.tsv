2009-05-06T04:29:00.000Z	JohnN		hi
2009-05-06T04:30:00.000Z	JohnN		I've just killed off gdm cos it was too much of a hog for this puny machine...
2009-05-06T04:30:00.000Z	gordonjcp	JohnN	uhm...
2009-05-06T04:30:00.000Z	JohnN		how can I trigger pam
2009-05-06T04:30:00.000Z	gordonjcp	JohnN	you know gdm doesn't run all the time?
2009-05-06T04:31:00.000Z	JohnN		with it running at all the machine ground to a halt
2009-05-06T04:31:00.000Z	gordonjcp	JohnN	what spec is the machine?
2009-05-06T04:31:00.000Z	JohnN		p3 600, 128, 9GB
2009-05-06T04:32:00.000Z	gordonjcp	JohnN	that's not really enough memory for 9.04, and indeed not really enough memory for 7.04
2009-05-06T04:32:00.000Z	JohnN		it seems to be OK now I just dumped gdm
2009-05-06T04:32:00.000Z	gordonjcp	JohnN	in fact, I don't think I've used a PC with less than 128M of memory this century
2009-05-06T04:32:00.000Z	JohnN		RAM is at about 50%
2009-05-06T04:33:00.000Z	JohnN		no swap
2009-05-06T04:33:00.000Z	JohnN		with firefox, xchat & a shell
2009-05-06T04:33:00.000Z	JohnN		using xubuntu 9.04
2009-05-06T04:34:00.000Z	JohnN		but gstreamer has packed up it's bags & I'm getting a password requester for the keyring
2009-05-06T04:35:00.000Z	JohnN	gordonjcp	I thought it'd be okish it's just going to become a web browser that needs user friendly wireless access point settings
2009-05-06T04:36:00.000Z	gordonjcp	JohnN	it's probably worth slapping some more memory in there
2009-05-06T04:37:00.000Z	JohnN	gordonjcp	max is 256 (2x128) but I spent 20mins in my local 2nd user shop going thru simms and none of the 128mb ones worked :(
