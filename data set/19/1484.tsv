2011-01-11T16:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		thats it :)
2011-01-11T16:53:00.000Z	Dumb_Jonny	ActionParsnip	I guess that works too, also the sudo group
2011-01-11T16:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dumb_Jonny	my user has sudo access and is not in the sudo group
2011-01-11T16:55:00.000Z	Dumb_Jonny	ActionParsnip	look at your sudoers file
2011-01-11T16:55:00.000Z	Dumb_Jonny	ActionParsnip	your probably in the admins group
2011-01-11T16:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dumb_Jonny	it's you're  and yes I am
2011-01-11T16:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dumb_Jonny	but i'm not in the sudo group, although it does exist
2011-01-11T16:57:00.000Z	Dumb_Jonny	ActionParsnip	alright then...
2011-01-11T16:58:00.000Z	Dumb_Jonny	ActionParsnip	you can be in either admin or sudo or you can add yourself directly into your sudoers file in /ect/sudoers but using "visudo"
2011-01-11T16:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dumb_Jonny	i'd use the group, its more graceful than messing with visudo which can make sudo not work
2011-01-11T16:59:00.000Z	Dumb_Jonny	ActionParsnip	if you are 100% don't know what your doing, I'd say no, don't do it.  But if you are in a room of Ubuntuers than worry free
2011-01-11T17:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dumb_Jonny	its just more graceful, and considering the target audience of ubuntu I'd stick to the easiest solution
2011-01-11T17:00:00.000Z	Dumb_Jonny	ActionParsnip	your right, I really don't want to fight with you over a silly thing like that
2011-01-11T17:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dumb_Jonny	deal :)
2011-01-11T17:07:00.000Z	Dumb_Jonny	ActionParsnip	so what do you think about Ubuntu's future?
