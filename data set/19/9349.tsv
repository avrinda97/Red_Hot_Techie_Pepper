2007-12-17T19:10:00.000Z	frojnd		mv *.asp *.htm   I'm trying to rename *.asp to *.html and than I get message: mv: end,*.html` not a directory ...
2007-12-17T19:11:00.000Z	Slart	frojnd	are you sure mv accepts wild-cards in both source and destination?
2007-12-17T19:12:00.000Z	frojnd	Slart	don't know..
2007-12-17T19:12:00.000Z	frojnd	Slart	any other suggestions to rename files with wildcards ?
2007-12-17T19:13:00.000Z	Slart	frojnd	I'd do something like this "for a in $(ls *.asp); do mv $a $a.html; done" it will turn mypage.asp into mypage.asp.html... you can probably tweak that into what you want
2007-12-17T19:13:00.000Z	Slart	frojnd	and there are applications available for doing renames
2007-12-17T19:14:00.000Z	Slart	frojnd	gwenrename is one
2007-12-17T19:18:00.000Z	Slart	frojnd	second try  "for a in $(ls *.asp | cut -d . -f 1); do mv $a.asp $a.html; done"  this ought to work

2009-12-20T17:57:00.000Z	Slart	frojnd	rescue mode? I thought it was called recovery mode.. I might be wrong though
2009-12-20T17:58:00.000Z	Slart	frojnd	if we're talking about the same thing it will just give you a root terminal.. so you can change passwords and such if you've forgotten them
2009-12-20T17:59:00.000Z	frojnd	Slart	aha ok
2009-12-20T18:08:00.000Z	Slart	frojnd	yes? I think I qualify as anyone
2009-12-20T18:09:00.000Z	frojnd	Slart	do you know what packages do I need or how can I install prerequirements for using openbox from server?
2009-12-20T18:11:00.000Z	Slart	frojnd	oh.. I have no idea.. if you just wanted attention to your question you should have just asked it again.. just wait 15 minutes or so before repeating
