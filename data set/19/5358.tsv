2008-07-15T07:34:00.000Z	ReAn[Laptop]		3 right? boot/main/swap
2008-07-15T07:34:00.000Z	dr_Willis	ReAn[Laptop]	 you dont really need a boot. / and swap.
2008-07-15T07:35:00.000Z	dr_Willis	ReAn[Laptop]	 i normally leave a sectionof the hd unallocated. and let the installer partition as needed
2008-07-15T07:35:00.000Z	ReAn[Laptop]	dr_Willis	id use guided... but none of the options are what i want
2008-07-15T07:36:00.000Z	ReAn[Laptop]		how much space should my swap be on a 1gb ram AMD64 4000+ ?
2008-07-15T07:36:00.000Z	dr_Willis	ReAn[Laptop]	 no idea what ya want. :) I often just use 3 primary partitions / /home and swap.
2008-07-15T07:36:00.000Z	ReAn[Laptop]		1gb?
2008-07-15T07:36:00.000Z	dr_Willis	ReAn[Laptop]	 if you want to suspend/hibernate - at least 1 gb.
