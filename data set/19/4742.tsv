2008-11-12T11:10:00.000Z	Shaggedelic	unstable	what laptop are you using?
2008-11-12T11:11:00.000Z	unstable	Shaggedelic	Thinkpad X61
2008-11-12T11:12:00.000Z	unstable	Shaggedelic	it was working, I right click and disabled wireless or something I think, and I'm not able to right click and re-enable it now.
2008-11-12T11:14:00.000Z	unstable	Shaggedelic	Enable Networking is checked, enable wireless is not checked. And it's faded so if I click on it, notihng happens.
2008-11-12T11:16:00.000Z	Shaggedelic	unstable	did you update your kernel by ay chance?
2008-11-12T11:17:00.000Z	unstable	Shaggedelic	I did whatever automatic update update-manager told me about. I believe there was a kernel upgrade yes. But I didn't do anything on my own, I'm using stock/default Ubuntu, with stock sources, and I just clicked ok when update-manager prompted me about new updates.
2008-11-12T11:18:00.000Z	Shaggedelic	unstable	okies and you had to compile madwifi for wireless driver support earlier eh?
2008-11-12T11:18:00.000Z	unstable	Shaggedelic	no, it's intel wireless. I didn't compile anything. It's a completely stock Ibex install, literally nothing has been tweaked/modified. I only did an update with upgrade-manager when prompted.
2008-11-12T11:22:00.000Z	Shaggedelic	unstable	ok and no updates just before the thing went bust
2008-11-12T11:22:00.000Z	unstable	Shaggedelic	Then what to do?
2008-11-12T11:24:00.000Z	unstable	Shaggedelic	There is only one kernel, and there are three options. The one kernel with standard arguments, the same kernel with single user mode, and memtest.
2008-11-12T11:24:00.000Z	unstable	Shaggedelic	Well I'm doing dpkg -al|grep linux-image, and there is only one kernel listed.
2008-11-12T11:24:00.000Z	Shaggedelic	unstable	then you probably have one kernel
2008-11-12T11:25:00.000Z	Shaggedelic	unstable	can you tell me the kernel version?
2008-11-12T11:26:00.000Z	unstable	Shaggedelic	yea, hardy wasn't like this. But ibex does something strange, i dunno what. Ibex is cleaning up after a kernel upgrade/reboot.
2008-11-12T11:27:00.000Z	Shaggedelic	unstable	check grub.conf and try booting to the old kernel
2008-11-12T11:27:00.000Z	unstable	Shaggedelic	grub.conf? you mean /boot/grub/menu.lst?
2008-11-12T11:27:00.000Z	unstable	Shaggedelic	If the package isn't listed in dpkg -al, it doesn't exist.
2008-11-12T11:28:00.000Z	unstable	Shaggedelic	ls /boot, doesn't show any other kernels. there is only one. It's gone.
