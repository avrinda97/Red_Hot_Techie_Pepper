2006-04-11T16:46:00.000Z	deadlycow21		i'm trying to get "NetworkManager-.0.6.0" up... I am having trouble with this because i don't know how to set the "cd" of the terminal correctly
2006-04-11T16:46:00.000Z	deadlycow21		then all i will have to do is type './configure'

2006-04-11T16:47:00.000Z	deadlycow21		oops
2006-04-11T16:47:00.000Z	deadlycow21		sorry
2006-04-11T16:48:00.000Z	deadlycow21		i know... my computer froze
2006-04-11T16:48:00.000Z	polpak	deadlycow21	what does "NetworkManager-.0.6.0" do?
2006-04-11T16:49:00.000Z	polpak	deadlycow21	I think there is already a network manager for ubuntu that works fine for wifi
2006-04-11T16:50:00.000Z	polpak	deadlycow21	it's already installed... System->Administration->Networking
2006-04-11T16:50:00.000Z	polpak	deadlycow21	ok, that's a different problem
2006-04-11T16:51:00.000Z	polpak	deadlycow21	you need your wireless network drivers
2006-04-11T16:53:00.000Z	polpak	deadlycow21	it's already installed, you just need the proper drivers for your wifi
2006-04-11T16:53:00.000Z	polpak	deadlycow21	unfortunately I'm not sure what those'd be as I don't have a lot of experience with wifi
2006-04-11T16:53:00.000Z	polpak	deadlycow21	there are possibly open source drivers, or you can use ndiswrapper
2006-04-11T16:54:00.000Z	polpak	deadlycow21	again, I'm not the one to ask.. But perhaps someone else can help
