2008-01-24T00:34:00.000Z	saxin	bardyr	does that actually work? :P
2008-01-24T00:34:00.000Z	bardyr	saxin	probably not :D
2008-01-24T00:34:00.000Z	saxin		hehe
2008-01-24T00:34:00.000Z	saxin		damn :/
2008-01-24T00:34:00.000Z	saxin		I have problems with ISA-server too
2008-01-24T00:34:00.000Z	bardyr	saxin	but there should be some ISA client/hax for linux
2008-01-24T00:34:00.000Z	saxin	bardyr	where can I get some more information?
2008-01-24T00:35:00.000Z	saxin	bardyr	I want it as easy as I can get it, please. :-P
2008-01-24T00:35:00.000Z	bardyr	saxin	google is probably the best bet
2008-01-24T00:36:00.000Z	saxin	bardyr	I have tried following some "how-to", but I fail everytime :-/
2008-01-24T00:36:00.000Z	saxin	bardyr	you know if ISA-problems have been worked on @ hardy?
2008-01-24T00:36:00.000Z	bardyr	saxin	i guess you can use a virtual windows to connect to it and then reroute it trough ssh but its kinda nasty
2008-01-24T00:36:00.000Z	saxin	bardyr	heh, i believe you :-P
2008-01-24T00:37:00.000Z	bardyr	saxin	samba should be able to handle ISA
2008-01-24T00:38:00.000Z	saxin	bardyr	in 8.04?
2008-01-24T00:38:00.000Z	bardyr	saxin	its probably hell to configure but you only need to do it once
2008-01-24T00:38:00.000Z	bardyr	saxin	gutsy should work too
2008-01-24T00:39:00.000Z	saxin	bardyr	how can I fix that? if you have any url for me, please share.
2008-01-24T00:40:00.000Z	bardyr	saxin	http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-networking-3/isa-client-for-linux-265924/ its kinda thin but if it gets your there
