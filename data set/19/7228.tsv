2009-05-14T17:12:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	vegpuff	Personally, I use dd to save the 512 mbr before I install windows, then I live boot and stamp the mbr back after the windows has finished messing with it
2009-05-14T17:13:00.000Z	vegpuff	Jack_Sparrow	oh :(
2009-05-14T17:13:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	vegpuff	there are many ways, ... that is the one I prefer
2009-05-14T17:13:00.000Z	vegpuff	Jack_Sparrow	I don't have the liveCD also with me
2009-05-14T17:14:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	vegpuff	have you already installed windows..again
2009-05-14T17:15:00.000Z	vegpuff	Jack_Sparrow	i tried supergrubdisk, no help
2009-05-14T17:15:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	vegpuff	you will need a live cd to fix it
2009-05-14T17:15:00.000Z	vegpuff	Jack_Sparrow	:(
2009-05-14T17:15:00.000Z	vegpuff	Jack_Sparrow	no live cd
2009-05-14T17:15:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	vegpuff	super grub seldom works for me
2009-05-14T17:15:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	vegpuff	sorry, no better answer
2009-05-14T17:18:00.000Z	vegpuff	Jack_Sparrow	is there anyway i can find the grub.conf of ubuntu 9.04 ?
2009-05-14T17:19:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	vegpuff	You cant get it to work without editing the 512 mbr manually.. and that is dangerous
2009-05-14T17:19:00.000Z	vegpuff	Jack_Sparrow	i have got a grub command line via supergrubdisk
2009-05-14T17:20:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	vegpuff	coldeq /join #winehq see them for any and all help with wine
