2012-10-24T18:55:00.000Z	lotuspsychje		marianna:you have an ati card?
2012-10-24T18:56:00.000Z	marianna	lotuspsychje	I have both ati and nvidia, currently using nvidia geforce 210. Could switch back, but both freeze.
2012-10-24T18:56:00.000Z	lotuspsychje		marianna:did you try unity2d?
2012-10-24T18:57:00.000Z	marianna	lotuspsychje	No, but that solution caught my eye. do you think that would work?
2012-10-24T18:57:00.000Z	lotuspsychje		marianna:interesting to know if its compiz related, also nomodeset would be good idea for testing
2012-10-24T18:58:00.000Z	lotuspsychje		!nomodeset | marianna
2012-10-24T18:59:00.000Z	marianna	lotuspsychje	I thought that was just for boot glitches. Mine boots fine.
2012-10-24T18:59:00.000Z	lotuspsychje		archlich:does hpliptools also support plotters? or you need something else?
2012-10-24T19:00:00.000Z	lotuspsychje		marianna:i had issues with xorg and ati myself, ang got troubles away on nomodeset,but at the end an updated fixed it all

2012-10-24T19:02:00.000Z	lotuspsychje		recovery

2012-10-24T19:05:00.000Z	lotuspsychje	deadmund	man fsck
2012-10-24T19:07:00.000Z	marianna	lotuspsychje	does changing to nomodeset/quite splash have any effect on things after it's booted? This happens while I'm using the booted computer.
2012-10-24T19:08:00.000Z	lotuspsychje		marianna:yes it would be interesting to know what your system does without compiz..just to test
2012-10-24T19:09:00.000Z	lotuspsychje		jorgp:good choice
2012-10-24T19:09:00.000Z	marianna	lotuspsychje	ok thanks, I'll try that.
