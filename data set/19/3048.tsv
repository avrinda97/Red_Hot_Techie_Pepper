2010-05-08T01:08:00.000Z	cowguru2000		Hey guys, I recently upgraded to Ubuntu 10.04 LTS and ever since my sound hasn't been working. I have an onboard sound card, it's some Intel chipset. Any thoughts/suggestions/help?
2010-05-08T01:08:00.000Z	Monotoko	cowguru2000	have you tried using restricted drivers?
2010-05-08T01:09:00.000Z	cowguru2000	Monotoko	no, i haven't
2010-05-08T01:09:00.000Z	Monotoko	cowguru2000	 System -> Administration -> Hardware Drivers
2010-05-08T01:10:00.000Z	cowguru2000	Monotoko	alright, hold on. the card worked in 9.10 this is odd
2010-05-08T01:11:00.000Z	cowguru2000	Monotoko	nothing
2010-05-08T01:12:00.000Z	Monotoko	cowguru2000	run lspci from the terminal and paste it into here: http://ubuntu.pastebin.com
2010-05-08T01:13:00.000Z	cowguru2000	Monotoko	http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/zNjU0qYe
2010-05-08T01:15:00.000Z	Monotoko	cowguru2000	was it an uprade or a clean install of 10.04?
2010-05-08T01:18:00.000Z	cowguru2000	Monotoko	upgrade
2010-05-08T01:18:00.000Z	Monotoko	cowguru2000	upgrades break quite a lot...i would try booting 10.04 from a LiveCD and see if you have the same issue
2010-05-08T01:19:00.000Z	cowguru2000	Monotoko	if i get around to burning a livecd i'll do that, thanks
2010-05-08T01:19:00.000Z	Monotoko	cowguru2000	live USB?
2010-05-08T01:19:00.000Z	cowguru2000	Monotoko	good idea :P
2010-05-08T03:32:00.000Z	cowguru2000	Monotoko	i did what you suggested (live USB)... my sound is now working
2010-05-08T03:33:00.000Z	Monotoko	cowguru2000	awesome, it will be the update then...its up to you now...you can try and track down the bug that killed your sound (cant help there sadly) or you can backup and install 10.04 clean
2010-05-08T03:33:00.000Z	cowguru2000	Monotoko	I think I'll just do the clean install :(
2010-05-08T03:34:00.000Z	cowguru2000	Monotoko	thanks a lot!
2010-05-08T03:35:00.000Z	Monotoko	cowguru2000	no worries :) wish i could help you fix your current install but its beyond my experiance
