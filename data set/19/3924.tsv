2009-08-29T02:27:00.000Z	waseem_		My ubuntu keeps freezing.
2009-08-29T02:28:00.000Z	mezquitale	waseem_	what version do you have?
2009-08-29T02:28:00.000Z	waseem_	mezquitale	8.04 LTS
2009-08-29T02:28:00.000Z	mezquitale	waseem_	try uninstall firefox and reinstalling it again
2009-08-29T02:29:00.000Z	waseem_	mezquitale	it freeze's even without firefox.
2009-08-29T02:29:00.000Z	mezquitale	waseem_	so your machine doesnt freeze with just firefox then?  It just freezes randomly?
2009-08-29T02:29:00.000Z	mezquitale	waseem_	do you have a laptop or  a desktop?
2009-08-29T02:30:00.000Z	waseem_	mezquitale	I have a laptop
2009-08-29T02:30:00.000Z	waseem_	mezquitale	if its any help it freezes on firefox and right now it froze when add/remove programs was on.
2009-08-29T02:30:00.000Z	mezquitale	waseem_	do you have a dual boot ??? are you experiencing the same problem on windows, if you have it installed?
2009-08-29T02:31:00.000Z	waseem_	mezquitale	yes I have dual boot but I have not logged into windows yet. also windows was fine when I last used it.
2009-08-29T02:31:00.000Z	mezquitale	waseem_	 I suspect it might be hardward,  I would say it's your hard drive, if your hard drive is making clickity sounds you know it's about to die
2009-08-29T02:32:00.000Z	mezquitale	waseem_	your machine used to work fine for a good time?  You didn't just upgrade anything, like software?
2009-08-29T02:33:00.000Z	waseem_	mezquitale	I had this huge mess up with my previous install of ubuntu and clean installed 8.04
2009-08-29T02:33:00.000Z	waseem_	mezquitale	i had upgraded to 9.04 and it had turned out my machine didnt get along.
2009-08-29T02:34:00.000Z	mezquitale	waseem_	so you just recently reinstalled 8.04 and now it's crashing all the time???  Sounds like it's your hard drive, I would check the hard drive first
2009-08-29T02:35:00.000Z	waseem_	mezquitale	yeah ok. How would I check my harddrive though? also my vista is working fine.
2009-08-29T02:36:00.000Z	mezquitale	waseem_	use a live cd and then run "fsck -f"
2009-08-29T02:37:00.000Z	mezquitale	waseem_	 i thought you said it freezes randomly, like with firefox and when you clicked on "add/remove software"?
