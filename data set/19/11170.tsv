2006-03-18T17:39:00.000Z	j-linux		This is the menu.lst (grub.conf) http://pastebin.com/598779
2006-03-18T17:39:00.000Z	j-linux		Do I need to change the hd0 entries in there?
2006-03-18T17:41:00.000Z	j-linux		I hope it works.
2006-03-18T17:43:00.000Z	j-linux		(just in case)
2006-03-18T17:44:00.000Z	fluxt	j-linux	if your cd is live you should kill it with a hammer
2006-03-18T06:36:00.000Z	j-linux	fluxt	so I should start grub with $ sudo grub ?
2006-03-18T06:36:00.000Z	fluxt	j-linux	can't hurt
2006-03-18T06:37:00.000Z	j-linux	fluxt	ok... here goes :S
2006-03-18T06:50:00.000Z	fluxt	j-linux	try update-grub and go from there
2006-03-18T06:51:00.000Z	fluxt	j-linux	as a precaution i'd not remove any boot links from menu.lst and add some testing ones to be safe
2006-03-18T06:51:00.000Z	j-linux	fluxt	great idea...
2006-03-18T06:52:00.000Z	j-linux	fluxt	It looks like update-grub only looks for vmlinuz- ? How will it find windows on hdb1 (which is not recognized by ubuntu until I mount it)
2006-03-18T06:52:00.000Z	fluxt	j-linux	you add that yourself (if it's not already there)
2006-03-18T06:52:00.000Z	fluxt	j-linux	since you've swapped hda with hdb i guess you'd just need to copy and paste, mod the titles and the hdX's for the additional links
2006-03-18T06:53:00.000Z	j-linux	fluxt	ok... I'll try adding a test entry to menu.lst and see how it goes first...
2006-03-18T06:55:00.000Z	fluxt	j-linux	my xp boot: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/10097
2006-03-18T06:56:00.000Z	j-linux	fluxt	thanks... that looks similar to mine... but I moved XP to another hard drive.. that is why I am worried.... If I'm back in 5 minutes, that means it worked ;)
2006-03-18T07:09:00.000Z	j-linux	fluxt	thanks for the idea of making test entries in menu.lst.. otherwise I wouldn't have been able to boot :S
2006-03-18T07:10:00.000Z	fluxt	j-linux	no worries :)
