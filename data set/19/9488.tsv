2006-11-04T14:25:00.000Z	hakrzcode	kikokos	usually running a video program from command line will usually spit out a reason for not playing. Have you tried this?
2006-11-04T14:28:00.000Z	hakrzcode	kikokos	running your error through google came up with: http://www.ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-194746.html
2006-11-04T14:29:00.000Z	hakrzcode	kikokos	look at the solution on that page.
2006-11-04T14:29:00.000Z	kikokos	hakrzcode	ok
2006-11-04T14:41:00.000Z	hakrzcode	kikokos	What is your video chip? lookitup with lspci from commandline.
2006-11-04T14:43:00.000Z	hakrzcode	kikokos	definately looks like you have a new chip. Video buffer size is not recognized probably.
