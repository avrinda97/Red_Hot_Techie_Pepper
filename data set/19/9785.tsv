2006-09-17T15:55:00.000Z	zaggynl		Hi I just followed this tutorial https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompositeManager/Xgl , but when I login to the new Xgl session, nothing happens for 10 seconds, then I get the gdm login screen back
2006-09-17T15:56:00.000Z	chibiace	zaggynl	i had that problem
2006-09-17T15:56:00.000Z	zaggynl	chibiace	ah cool, did you resolve the issue?
2006-09-17T15:57:00.000Z	chibiace	zaggynl	yes, i installed compiz, and rebooted, messed and it worked after awhile.
2006-09-17T15:57:00.000Z	zaggynl	chibiace	I just followed the tutorial from the wiki, but I only got so far, what should I do?
2006-09-17T15:58:00.000Z	chibiace	zaggynl	the next page for compiz ?
2006-09-17T15:58:00.000Z	zaggynl	chibiace	You mean I should look in the wiki for Compiz?
2006-09-17T15:59:00.000Z	chibiace	zaggynl	on the xgl one there should be a next page with compiz on it
2006-09-17T15:59:00.000Z	chibiace	zaggynl	oh i also did some gconf commands from the gentoo-wiki xgl page
2006-09-17T15:59:00.000Z	zaggynl	chibiace	ah yes
2006-09-17T15:59:00.000Z	zaggynl	chibiace	I think I'm stuck at 'This procedure assumes that you have logged into your Xgl server session'
2006-09-17T16:00:00.000Z	chibiace	zaggynl	did you add the gdm script thing with gnome-session etc?
2006-09-17T16:00:00.000Z	zaggynl	chibiace	Yep
2006-09-17T16:00:00.000Z	zaggynl	chibiace	I'll recheck the files to be sure
2006-09-17T16:01:00.000Z	chibiace	zaggynl	anyway sorry i cant be of much help. i didnt do any more then what i said i did. rebooting sometimes is good too
2006-09-17T16:02:00.000Z	zaggynl	chibiace	I'm already happy I'm not alone in my problem :)
2006-09-17T16:02:00.000Z	chibiace	zaggynl	go with cgwd too
2006-09-17T16:02:00.000Z	zaggynl	chibiace	cgwd?
