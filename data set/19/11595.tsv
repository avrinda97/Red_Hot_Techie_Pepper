2005-12-26T12:59:00.000Z	Eleaf		Is anybody familiar with nfs?  ?
2005-12-26T13:00:00.000Z	Falstius	Eleaf	it is the pain in the diodes on my left side.
2005-12-26T13:01:00.000Z	Eleaf	Falstius	are you familiar with helping me with it? = p
2005-12-26T13:04:00.000Z	Falstius	Eleaf	sorry, didn't mean to ignore you.  I can only help you with nfs if it is really really easy.
2005-12-26T13:06:00.000Z	Eleaf	Falstius	I got it working again!
2005-12-26T13:07:00.000Z	Falstius	Eleaf	it is an unsecured wireless router and one of your neighbors has a sense of humor.
2005-12-26T13:07:00.000Z	Eleaf	Falstius	lol
2005-12-26T14:32:00.000Z	Eleaf	Falstius	yes I know..
2005-12-26T14:32:00.000Z	Eleaf	Falstius	I have mine all up and running, Falstius Falstius lol
2005-12-26T14:38:00.000Z	Falstius	Eleaf	you can request to have the nickname freed.
2005-12-26T14:38:00.000Z	Eleaf	Falstius	really now?  that's exuberant!
2005-12-26T14:38:00.000Z	Falstius	Eleaf	exuberant doesn't work that way.
2005-12-26T14:39:00.000Z	Eleaf	Falstius	maybe it does, oh well I got it registered yay
2006-04-03T14:42:00.000Z	Falstius	Eleaf	it probably modifies the network config file and then just restarts the network.
2006-04-03T14:43:00.000Z	Eleaf	Falstius	I can't get ubuntu to recognize my network card.  (I can't open gnome network-admin because X doesn't start, no matter what I do)
2006-04-03T14:43:00.000Z	Falstius	Eleaf	if you type /sbin/ifconfig does it list a "eth" card?
2006-04-03T14:43:00.000Z	Eleaf	Falstius	I don't believe so
2006-04-03T14:43:00.000Z	Eleaf	Falstius	no only lo.
