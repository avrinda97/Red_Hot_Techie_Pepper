2008-08-03T10:28:00.000Z	Blinkiz		Hi. Every time I start my laptop with my 1680x1050 LCD monitor attached, the screen on my LCD is defaulting to 1440x900. I have my laptops monitor disabled. How can I make so ubuntu is having 1680x1050 as default and not 1440x900? I must manually set this every time my computer has booted the X. I have a nvidia geforce 8600 card in my laptop.

2008-08-03T10:35:00.000Z	Blinkiz	wols	Okay, xorg.0.log contains one interesting thing. High up in the file, my LCD is detected as "(II) NVIDIA(0): Virtual screen size determined to be 1680 x 1050". But at the bottom, is the line "(II) NVIDIA(0): Setting mode "1440x900"". I don't get it.
2008-08-03T10:35:00.000Z	wols	Blinkiz	in between there is more
2008-08-03T10:40:00.000Z	Blinkiz	wols	Well, am not an expert at this. Care to look? http://blinkiz.pastebin.com/dda3b43f . I have a TV connected at the moment but it's the same problem when I have it disconnected.
2008-08-03T10:41:00.000Z	wols	Blinkiz	is 1440x900 in your xorg.conf?
2008-08-03T10:42:00.000Z	Blinkiz	wols	It shouldn't be. But I take a look. w8
2008-08-03T10:43:00.000Z	Blinkiz	wols	Nothing in xorg.conf. The monitor section look like this: http://blinkiz.pastebin.com/d5907408e
2008-08-03T10:44:00.000Z	wols	Blinkiz	but you can change to 1650x1050 after it's started?
2008-08-03T10:44:00.000Z	Blinkiz	wols	Yes, no problem at all
2008-08-03T10:44:00.000Z	wols	Blinkiz	I'd add the 1650 res in xorg.conf and force it that way
2008-08-03T10:44:00.000Z	Blinkiz	wols	okay, what should I type?
2008-08-03T10:46:00.000Z	Blinkiz	wols	You can see my xorg.conf here: http://blinkiz.pastebin.com/d131a25d2
2008-08-03T10:47:00.000Z	wols	Blinkiz	    Modes           "nvidia-auto-select"
2008-08-03T10:47:00.000Z	Blinkiz	wols	Aha..
2008-08-03T10:50:00.000Z	Blinkiz	wols	I believe this is correct to add: Option "metamodes" "CRT: 1680x1050 +0+0"
2008-08-03T10:51:00.000Z	Blinkiz	wols	Can this be correct?
2008-08-03T10:51:00.000Z	wols	Blinkiz	why do you ask me? why not, I dunno, TRY?
2008-08-03T10:51:00.000Z	Blinkiz	wols	I try it. brb
