2009-02-08T07:40:00.000Z	l7		hi, i just installed the openssh server but i can't get a command prompt when i shell in to my box.  do i need to configure it to use a different login shell?
2009-02-08T07:41:00.000Z	tritium	l7	nope
2009-02-08T07:41:00.000Z	l7	tritium	why can't i get a command prompt then?
2009-02-08T07:41:00.000Z	tritium	l7	not sure.  You should be.
2009-02-08T07:45:00.000Z	tritium	l7	you don't have to reboot.  sudo invoke-rc.d ssh restart, and see if it works
2009-02-08T07:50:00.000Z	tritium	l7	did you restart it, as I told you to?
2009-02-08T07:50:00.000Z	l7	tritium	kill it and restart it?
2009-02-08T07:50:00.000Z	tritium	l7	no, sudo invoke-rc.d ssh restart, like I said
2009-02-08T07:52:00.000Z	tritium	l7	then what do you get when you ssh to your box?
2009-02-08T07:52:00.000Z	tritium	l7	what do you see?  Can you pastebin it?
2009-02-08T07:53:00.000Z	l7	tritium	yes, in a moment
2009-02-08T07:54:00.000Z	l7	tritium	 [Act: 9,10,11]
2009-02-08T07:54:00.000Z	l7	tritium	here it is: http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/d27c070bc
2009-02-08T07:54:00.000Z	tritium	l7	looks like irssi ;)
2009-02-08T07:56:00.000Z	tritium	l7	hitting "enter" doesn't get you a command prompt?
2009-02-08T07:58:00.000Z	l7	tritium	no, it just creates a new line in the terminal screen, but nothing happens
2009-02-08T07:59:00.000Z	tritium	l7	that's quite odd.  I've never seen that happen before.
2009-02-08T07:59:00.000Z	l7	tritium	okay this is weird, hitting ctrl-\ allows me to get a working shell
2009-02-08T08:00:00.000Z	tritium	l7	it is...very
