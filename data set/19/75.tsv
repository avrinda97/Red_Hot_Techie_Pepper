Now, is everyone going to complain about my speech or is someone going to try to be productive? [calrogman and Caliope so far have been the only two remotely helping me, and someone ran off Caliope]
2012-10-14T06:59:00.000Z	darkelfjuggalo		you mean I can use a 32-bit install and save myself the headache?
2012-10-14T06:59:00.000Z	darkelfjuggalo		why is it going to take half of my ram?
2012-10-14T07:00:00.000Z	dsnyders	darkelfjuggalo	2^32 = 4G,
2012-10-14T07:02:00.000Z	darkelfjuggalo		it seems to be my only option aside from returning to winblows...but i need ALL of my RAM in order to use the programs I need for school...
2012-10-14T07:03:00.000Z	dsnyders	darkelfjuggalo	Just curious... have you looked into virtual machines?
2012-10-14T07:04:00.000Z	darkelfjuggalo	dsnyders	: my school requires Winblows, i hate it, I was going to Virtual Machine that on my Linux so i don't have to maintain antivirus BS
2012-10-14T07:05:00.000Z	darkelfjuggalo		Calrogman ; DVD iso is how I use my debian on the same flash drive [I store DVD 1 of the complete set, and run that like I would a Netinstall]
2012-10-14T07:05:00.000Z	darkelfjuggalo		Calrogman: I know thats whay I want to VM the Winblows rather than my linux
2012-10-14T07:09:00.000Z	darkelfjuggalo		With Debian[x86], I just Cat .iso > USB_Drive ... with Ubuntu i have cat .iso > USB_Drive [Result: isolinux.bin missing or corrupt], I have unetbootin [Result: isolinux.bin missing or corrupt] and I have pendriveinstaller [result: begin installation>Fail to detect networking hardware>Fail consecutive steps up to and including software install]
2012-10-14T07:11:00.000Z	darkelfjuggalo		someone suggested that earleir and lost me
2012-10-14T07:12:00.000Z	darkelfjuggalo		ok they just said to 'dd' and gave no instruction beyond that
2012-10-14T07:15:00.000Z	darkelfjuggalo		will DD reformat the drive before installing?
2012-10-14T07:15:00.000Z	darkelfjuggalo		before writing^
2012-10-14T07:16:00.000Z	darkelfjuggalo		just write over the existing file?
2012-10-14T07:16:00.000Z	darkelfjuggalo		ok kool
2012-10-14T07:16:00.000Z	dsnyders	darkelfjuggalo	if you're trying to put a bootable linux on a USB, I suggest looking at the pendrivelinux site.
2012-10-14T07:17:00.000Z	darkelfjuggalo		dsynders : I did pendriveinstaller earlier [result: begin installation>Fail to detect networking hardware>Fail consecutive steps up to and including software install]
2012-10-14T07:20:00.000Z	dsnyders	darkelfjuggalo	ah... that sucks.  I've always had pretty good luck with the pendrivelinux stuff.
