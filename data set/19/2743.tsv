2010-01-16T05:41:00.000Z	Mahal		Hi channel!
2010-01-16T05:43:00.000Z	Mahal		I have some trouble setting up a Karmic laptop for a friend here. I have a router with broken IPv6 support, but after disabling IPv6 with Firefox I get online on web and can ping. But I still cant get any contact with apt-get, synaptic or updates. I tried to set both local and main servers in software sources.Any tips?
2010-01-16T05:45:00.000Z	Dunkirk	Mahal	Can you go to, say, google.com?
2010-01-16T05:46:00.000Z	Mahal	Dunkirk	Yes, no problem
2010-01-16T05:47:00.000Z	Mahal	Dunkirk	Can not connect to archive.ubuntu.com:80 (1.0.0.0), time out
2010-01-16T05:50:00.000Z	Dunkirk	Mahal	Sounds like a name resolution problem. What's in your /etc/resolv.conf?
2010-01-16T05:53:00.000Z	Mahal	Dunkirk	nameserver 192.168.1.1 - which is my router
2010-01-16T05:53:00.000Z	Dunkirk	Mahal	Sounds right, but archive.ubuntu.com ought to come back as something other than 1.0.0.0...
2010-01-16T05:54:00.000Z	Mahal	Dunkirk	yeah I also though that sounds a bit strange
2010-01-16T05:55:00.000Z	Dunkirk	Mahal	It's a long shot, but it sounds like your upstream provider's DNS servers aren't resolving ubuntu.com names.
2010-01-16T05:55:00.000Z	Dunkirk	Mahal	How about this: `dig @208.67.220.220 archive.ubuntu.com'
2010-01-16T05:56:00.000Z	Mahal	Dunkirk	hmmm where do you mean to put that? Im quite a newbie.
2010-01-16T05:56:00.000Z	Dunkirk	Mahal	Open a terminal and paste that.
2010-01-16T05:57:00.000Z	Dunkirk	Mahal	It will resolve archive.ubuntu.com to an IP address by OpenDNS servers.
2010-01-16T05:59:00.000Z	Mahal	Dunkirk	1 server found, got answer, and a list of 5 IPs
2010-01-16T05:59:00.000Z	Dunkirk	Mahal	That's good. Use `nameserver 208.67.220.220' in your /etc/resolv.conf and try the update again.
2010-01-16T06:01:00.000Z	Dunkirk	Mahal	Right. The update to /etc/network/interfaces will only take effect on reboot or a `/etc/init.d/networking restart'
2010-01-16T06:05:00.000Z	Mahal	Dunkirk	Great! update manager got connected. Now, should I add another IP in there for the local norwegian package server, or should that one do?
2010-01-16T06:06:00.000Z	Dunkirk	Mahal	that should do it for now, but you should follow mazda01's advice too.
