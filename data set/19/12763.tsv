2005-07-16T09:54:00.000Z	qt2		*looks through synaptic* where IS jack anyway?
2005-07-16T09:55:00.000Z	thoreauputic	qt2	jackd perhaps
2005-07-27T07:12:00.000Z	qt2	thoreauputic	gtk based?
2005-07-27T07:12:00.000Z	thoreauputic	qt2	yes, it uses the Xdialog thing
2005-07-27T07:14:00.000Z	qt2	thoreauputic	xdialog?
2005-07-27T07:14:00.000Z	thoreauputic	qt2	 apt-cache show xdialog :)
2005-07-27T07:15:00.000Z	qt2	thoreauputic	fun.
2005-07-27T07:18:00.000Z	qt2	thoreauputic	heh, all i could use now is a dialog that mimics the default gnome volume contorl overlay... ;)
2005-07-29T10:34:00.000Z	qt2	thoreauputic	what's wrong with backports?
2005-07-29T10:35:00.000Z	thoreauputic	qt2	nothing as such - but I would comment them out after using them personally
2005-07-29T10:35:00.000Z	thoreauputic	qt2	as you see, it solved the problem for Luna
2005-07-29T10:36:00.000Z	qt2	thoreauputic	*shrug* i never really understood exactly what backports were anyway...
2005-07-29T10:37:00.000Z	thoreauputic	qt2	in simple terms, newer stuff made to work with the current Hoary
2005-09-12T16:11:00.000Z	thoreauputic	qt2	got it?
2005-09-12T16:12:00.000Z	thoreauputic	qt2	sort of like reading War and Peace, only a lot less interesting
2005-09-12T16:13:00.000Z	qt2	thoreauputic	heh, well, thanks. :o
2005-09-12T16:13:00.000Z	thoreauputic	qt2	a lot of it won't be relevant unless you have similar apps
2005-09-12T16:14:00.000Z	qt2	thoreauputic	so i'll get a lot of "file does not exist"s but at least it'll be correcting the base system at the same time.
2005-09-12T16:15:00.000Z	thoreauputic	qt2	BTW I an t as user so there were a few "Permission Denied" lines
