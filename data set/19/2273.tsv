2010-11-14T17:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	nits	 it starts dimming from the start of video playback? or after in the movie part way?
2010-11-14T17:18:00.000Z	nits	Dr_Willis	wenever i go to full screen
2010-11-14T17:19:00.000Z	nits	Dr_Willis	3 secs approx
2010-11-14T17:19:00.000Z	nits	Dr_Willis	and it stays dim, not complete black
2010-11-14T17:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	nits	 sounds almost like a power saveing setting kicking in..
2010-11-14T17:20:00.000Z	nits	Dr_Willis	my comp jus woke up from a monitor power saver setting about 15 mins back
2010-11-14T17:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	nits	 perhaps check out the settings in the powersaver tool/gui.  theres be3en some bugs with powersaveing
2010-11-14T17:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	nits	 it would be a interesting test if it did it with any other players or just vlc.. if it did it in vlc with other desktops/window managers also.
2010-11-14T17:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	nits	 there is a 'dim on inactive' setting i thought. That slmost sounds like thats kicking in.
2010-11-14T17:22:00.000Z	nits	Dr_Willis	Jus checked it out, totem seems to act the same
2010-11-14T17:23:00.000Z	nits	Dr_Willis	Played with the settings, no go, gonna log out and log back in (the session i mean) . See if that works
2010-11-14T17:30:00.000Z	nits	Dr_Willis	wen i restarted xserver it didn't solve the dimming issue
2010-11-14T17:31:00.000Z	nits	Dr_Willis	but a restart of the whole system seemed to do the trick
2010-11-14T17:31:00.000Z	nits	Dr_Willis	 :)
2010-11-14T17:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	nits	 use a bigger hammer! :)
2010-11-14T17:31:00.000Z	nits	Dr_Willis	The full restart was the big hammer :P
