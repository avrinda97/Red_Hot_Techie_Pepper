2011-05-27T08:34:00.000Z	LuckySMack		it seems that whenever i tun wine in natty it just comp;etely crashes my window manager and logs me out. when loggin back in all my applications are closed. is anyone familiar with this issue?
2011-05-27T08:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	LuckySMack	what version of wine?
2011-05-27T08:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	LuckySMack	have you tried asking in #winehq
2011-05-27T08:37:00.000Z	LuckySMack	ActionParsnip	ah i tried #wine and nobody was there. good to know. i have wine 1.3.15
2011-05-27T08:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	LuckySMack	the driver is made by nvidia and is the same version and files as the ones in the previous versions as there is only one source of the driver, nvidia
2011-05-27T08:49:00.000Z	LuckySMack	ActionParsnip	yea but all the ones ive tried just dont work. whenever i boot up gmd immediately crashes, if it even gets to the desktop before crashing
2011-05-27T08:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	LuckySMack	maybe its a bug with the xorg version in natty combined with the driver
2011-05-27T08:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	LuckySMack	could try the 185 driver instead, may be nicer
2011-05-27T08:51:00.000Z	LuckySMack	ActionParsnip	i did try t
2011-05-27T08:52:00.000Z	LuckySMack	ActionParsnip	oops. i did try the non recommended as well as the free vesion. all did the same thing
2011-05-27T08:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	LuckySMack	which version does recommended install?
2011-05-27T08:54:00.000Z	LuckySMack	ActionParsnip	nvidia-current_270.41.06-0ubuntu1_amd64.deb
2011-05-27T08:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	LuckySMack	so try the 185 driver, remove that driver and install the nvidia-glx-185 package
2011-05-27T08:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	LuckySMack	or if that is bad, try: nvidia-173
2011-05-27T08:56:00.000Z	LuckySMack	ActionParsnip	alright ill try 185. 173 is the other option in the drivers list, which does the same thing
2011-05-27T08:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	LuckySMack	you may need to run:  sudo nvidia-xconfig    it may help the driver to have an xorg.conf file
2011-05-27T08:58:00.000Z	LuckySMack	ActionParsnip	yea i did notice that when installing the driver and running sudo nvidia-settings it never made an xconf unless i told it to write it.
2011-05-27T08:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	LuckySMack	that command makes one for you
2011-05-27T08:59:00.000Z	LuckySMack	ActionParsnip	ok. yea ill try that one in a bit when i can. thanks.
