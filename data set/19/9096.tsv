2007-05-19T16:28:00.000Z	daedra		hmm it seems that compiz is still a bit unstable in Feisty
2007-05-19T16:29:00.000Z	daedra		after a long session of messing around it always hangs needing cold boot
2007-05-19T16:29:00.000Z	PriceChild	daedra	on the desktop-effects window it states that is an experiemental feature, a technology preview etc. etc.
2007-05-19T16:29:00.000Z	daedra	PriceChild	I know, but i'm getting needy like a spoilt child
2007-07-23T11:26:00.000Z	PriceChild	daedra	you don't need to.
2007-07-23T11:26:00.000Z	PriceChild	daedra	why do you think you need to?
2007-07-23T11:27:00.000Z	daedra	PriceChild	I am attempting to tunnel into my pc from a remote location, and accessing it remotely has me type in the root password
2007-07-23T11:27:00.000Z	PriceChild	daedra	I'd advise strongly against that... :)
2007-07-23T11:27:00.000Z	PriceChild	daedra	you're using ssh right? With openssh-server installed?
2007-07-23T11:28:00.000Z	daedra	PriceChild	I use ssh -L 5902:localhost:5901 serveraddress
2007-07-23T11:28:00.000Z	daedra	PriceChild	i'm using sshd
2007-07-23T11:28:00.000Z	PriceChild	daedra	use the -l option to choose your username
2007-07-23T11:28:00.000Z	daedra	PriceChild	oh cool
2007-07-23T11:28:00.000Z	PriceChild	daedra	so for example ssh -L 5902:localhost:5901 serveraddress -l <your chosen username>
2007-07-23T11:29:00.000Z	daedra	PriceChild	that solves EVERYTHING thanks
2007-07-23T11:29:00.000Z	PriceChild	daedra	the only time you should ever use root/sudo is for system administration...
2007-07-23T11:29:00.000Z	PriceChild	daedra	if you are just using computers and think you need sudo then it is broken
2007-07-23T11:30:00.000Z	daedra	PriceChild	thanks - some good advice
2008-11-06T00:52:00.000Z	PriceChild	daedra	evolution does it by default for me
