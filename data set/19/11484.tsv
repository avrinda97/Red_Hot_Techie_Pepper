2007-02-14T09:56:00.000Z	__mikem	Madpilot	I don't know if this is your department, but would you mind checking the cd image for the 64 bit version of ubuntu on the website, I have someone saying that the installer isn't working properly complaining about a missing font file, the guy appears to know what he is talking about, and insists the cd selfcheck returned no errors
2007-02-14T09:57:00.000Z	Madpilot	__mikem	not my department at all - file a bug @ bugs.ubuntu.com
