2011-09-23T19:14:00.000Z	pawan_tejwani		can anybody please tell me about "Why I am getting ip address as 192.168.1.4" in Ubuntu server instead of getting 192.168.1.2
2011-09-23T19:16:00.000Z	pawan_tejwani		how to revert the IP address to previous configuration ?
2011-09-23T19:17:00.000Z	pawan_tejwani		by mistake I assigned IP address as 192.18
2011-09-23T19:17:00.000Z	pawan_tejwani		** 192.168.1.2
2011-09-23T19:17:00.000Z	pawan_tejwani		statically
2011-09-23T19:17:00.000Z	pawan_tejwani		whereas I configured at time of installation as DHCP
2011-09-23T19:17:00.000Z	pawan_tejwani		now everytime I reboot it, it acquires 192.168.1.4
2011-09-23T19:18:00.000Z	pawan_tejwani		what can be the problem ? please help
2011-09-23T19:18:00.000Z	theadmin	pawan_tejwani	Is that a desktop system?
2011-09-23T19:18:00.000Z	theadmin	pawan_tejwani	As in, do you have networkmanager running?
2011-09-23T19:18:00.000Z	pawan_tejwani	theadmin	its ubuntu enterprise cloud
2011-09-23T19:19:00.000Z	pawan_tejwani	theadmin	basically for private cloud
2011-09-23T19:19:00.000Z	theadmin	pawan_tejwani	No idea what on Earth that is, doubt I can help you there
2011-09-23T19:19:00.000Z	theadmin	pawan_tejwani	Just try to stop dhcpcd from autostartingand reconfigure it to use a custom IP adress
2011-09-23T19:19:00.000Z	pawan_tejwani	theadmin	networking is same as desktop only but through command prompt and I am damn bad at networking :(
2011-09-23T19:21:00.000Z	pawan_tejwani	theadmin	wait I will restart dhcpd service
2011-09-23T19:21:00.000Z	theadmin	pawan_tejwani	Do not restart, stop it
2011-09-23T19:21:00.000Z	theadmin	pawan_tejwani	Also, it's dhcpcd
2011-09-23T19:21:00.000Z	theadmin	pawan_tejwani	With a silly nonsensical "c" after the dhcp thing :D
