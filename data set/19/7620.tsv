2007-07-24T08:46:00.000Z	Hornet`		Bleh, no matter.  How can I see what's actually *in* lost*found?

2007-07-24T08:46:00.000Z	wbadger	Hornet`	you should have the user's password and use "sudo"
2007-07-24T08:47:00.000Z	Hornet`	wbadger	It's a root shell.
2007-07-24T08:47:00.000Z	wbadger	Hornet`	so what do you get when you "ls /lost+found" ?
2007-07-24T08:47:00.000Z	Hornet`		It's empty, yet there's still a large amount of space being used.
2007-07-24T08:48:00.000Z	wbadger	Hornet`	how do you know it uses the space?
2007-07-24T08:49:00.000Z	Hornet`		The there's about 3% gone on two drives, the only thing there is L&F.

2007-07-24T08:53:00.000Z	wbadger	Hornet`	not according to ls

2007-07-24T08:54:00.000Z	Hornet`		Fair enough, but I assure you that a load of space is missing somehow. :\
