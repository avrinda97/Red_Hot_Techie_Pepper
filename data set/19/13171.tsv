2005-05-14T12:02:00.000Z	Mistiry		with my monitor
2005-05-14T12:03:00.000Z	Mistiry		Sorry. I am having a problem with my monitor. At the very bottom right above the toolbar it has some garbled display. I have tried different resolutions and refresh rates. Any ideas?
2005-05-14T12:05:00.000Z	jordanau	Mistiry	like a non computer speaker?
2005-05-14T12:05:00.000Z	jordanau	Mistiry	is it a dell?
2005-05-14T12:06:00.000Z	jordanau	Mistiry	yeah my old dell would do that, it went away when i wiggled the screen
2005-05-14T12:07:00.000Z	Mistiry	jordanau	i tried all that. dont know what i can do to fix it......
2005-05-14T12:07:00.000Z	jordanau	Mistiry	well that most likey a hardware issue, for your own good, you can probably find better help for that elsewhere
2005-05-14T12:08:00.000Z	Mistiry	jordanau	where else can i go?
2005-05-14T12:09:00.000Z	jordanau	Mistiry	wait it works on windows and not linux?
2005-05-14T12:09:00.000Z	Mistiry	jordanau	yes. and an external monitor doesnt show it
2005-05-14T12:09:00.000Z	jordanau	Mistiry	sounds like it might be a driver issue then
2005-05-14T12:09:00.000Z	jordanau	Mistiry	i cant help though
2005-05-14T12:10:00.000Z	Mistiry	jordanau	thats what i thought. but wouldnt that mean that the external monitor would have the same problem?
2005-05-14T12:10:00.000Z	jordanau	Mistiry	no
2005-05-14T12:10:00.000Z	Mistiry	jordanau	guess i can google my laptop and look for drivers? do they even have drivers availiable for linux anywhere?
2005-05-14T12:10:00.000Z	jordanau	Mistiry	you would have seperate things controlling the monitor and the lcd
2005-05-14T12:11:00.000Z	jordanau	Mistiry	cant help man wish i could tell you, i'd just google
2005-05-14T12:36:00.000Z	jordanau	Mistiry	control-alt-backspace is one way
