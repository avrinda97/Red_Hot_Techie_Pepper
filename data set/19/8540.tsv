2007-12-24T18:44:00.000Z	Andeh		Question: Is SCSI SATA?
2007-12-24T18:45:00.000Z	wols	Andeh	no it's not
2007-12-24T18:45:00.000Z	Andeh	wols	Oh. Cause I found this guide for running my windows partition in VMWare
2007-12-24T18:45:00.000Z	wols	Andeh	so?
2007-12-26T22:29:00.000Z	Andeh	wols	Reconfiguring XORG entirely seems rather inneficient since I have everything running perfectly except for the screen res...
2007-12-26T22:32:00.000Z	Andeh	wols	I reconfigured XORG, I told it to use the monitor's full res, and it still doesnt show up in the options.
2007-12-26T22:32:00.000Z	wols	Andeh	pastbein your xorg.log
2007-12-26T22:33:00.000Z	Andeh	wols	xorg.log is in /etc/X11 right?
2007-12-26T22:33:00.000Z	wols	Andeh	no, in your log files directory
2007-12-26T22:34:00.000Z	Andeh	wols	Where is that?
2007-12-26T22:35:00.000Z	Andeh	wols	http://pastebin.com/d336b8a2d
2007-12-26T22:35:00.000Z	Andeh	wols	line 150: (WW) NVIDIA(0): No valid modes for "1680x1050"; removing.
2007-12-26T22:36:00.000Z	Andeh	wols	I remember on windows I had to install drivers for this weird monitor.
2007-12-26T22:39:00.000Z	Andeh	wols	What does it mean when xorg says that there are "no valid modes for" my correct resolution?
2007-12-26T22:39:00.000Z	Andeh	wols	I think it means the NVIDIA driver doesnt support it; I had to install an extra driver from the monitor's website on Windows XP,
2007-12-26T22:41:00.000Z	wols	Andeh	I means the monitors says it can do it and nvidia says with the way I'm configured and what the monitor reports as being capable it's not possible
2007-12-26T22:42:00.000Z	Andeh	wols	Ah. So um, what is there to do?
2007-12-26T22:45:00.000Z	Andeh	wols	Uh, so I am stuck with a blurry, deformed display?
2007-12-26T23:04:00.000Z	Andeh	wols	Are you still here?
