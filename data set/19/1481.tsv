2011-11-11T18:51:00.000Z	schnuffle	Um_cara_qualquer	If you want to install emesene on your system use the PPA repository. Then you can install it with aptitude install emesene
2011-11-11T18:52:00.000Z	Um_cara_qualquer	schnuffle	I installed emesene with apt-get
2011-11-11T18:53:00.000Z	schnuffle	Um_cara_qualquer	okay and it has a problem with connecting? How do you want sove this problem? Got a hint from somwhere?
2011-11-11T18:54:00.000Z	Um_cara_qualquer	schnuffle	just that file... but it does not say where extract or how run it
2011-11-11T18:55:00.000Z	schnuffle	Um_cara_qualquer	Which file? To build from the sources you need to enter: python setup.py install
2011-11-11T19:04:00.000Z	schnuffle	Um_cara_qualquer	if you extract the package cd into it, then you run python setup.py build. You'll have the binaries under ./build
2011-11-11T19:05:00.000Z	Um_cara_qualquer	schnuffle	just to be clear, this is the command: "python setup.py build" ... and than ./build?
2011-11-11T19:06:00.000Z	schnuffle	Um_cara_qualquer	 the command executed in the emesene directory is python setup.py build. Afterwards there wil be a dir called build where the builded files are found
2011-11-11T19:09:00.000Z	schnuffle	Um_cara_qualquer	I still don't really know what you want to do?
2011-11-11T19:10:00.000Z	schnuffle	Um_cara_qualquer	That is clear but how do you want to solve this problem? Install from the sources?
