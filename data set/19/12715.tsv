2005-07-20T13:48:00.000Z	OdiiN		it takes a long time to start, about 5 minutes
2005-07-20T13:48:00.000Z	OdiiN		since i restart
2005-07-20T13:48:00.000Z	OdiiN		gkshell for example aswell
2005-07-20T13:49:00.000Z	OdiiN		anyone has a tip for this?
2005-07-20T13:49:00.000Z	HappyFool	OdiiN	odd. have you looked in /var/log/Xorg.0.log for information?
2005-07-20T13:54:00.000Z	HappyFool	OdiiN	hmm, nothing obvious there
2005-07-20T13:55:00.000Z	HappyFool	OdiiN	look also in /var/log/syslog and /var/log/messages -- maybe it's another service that's failing to start, e.g., if your network interface can't be brought up
2005-07-20T13:56:00.000Z	OdiiN	HappyFool	i change currently /etc/modules to load VIA ide drivers, could be this?
2005-07-20T13:57:00.000Z	HappyFool	OdiiN	um, could be, i don't know. Try taking it out and reboot?
2005-07-20T13:57:00.000Z	HappyFool	OdiiN	whatever you changed from when it was working is what you should test first
2005-07-20T14:12:00.000Z	OdiiN	HappyFool	 is a script that i put un /etc/init.d/ to configure iptables
2005-07-20T14:13:00.000Z	HappyFool	OdiiN	I'm not really clued up on iptables, but I'll take a look
2005-07-20T14:13:00.000Z	HappyFool	OdiiN	sorry, i don't know if that's right or not
2005-07-20T14:14:00.000Z	HappyFool	OdiiN	yip
2005-07-21T12:16:00.000Z	HappyFool	OdiiN	try it in an xterm -- it seems to work there
2005-07-21T12:16:00.000Z	HappyFool	OdiiN	maybe you need to tweak gnome-terminal settings
2005-07-21T12:17:00.000Z	OdiiN	HappyFool	 works at terminal, but i need a command, to use in gkrellm
2005-07-21T12:21:00.000Z	HappyFool	OdiiN	sorry, no clue about gkrellm ;)
