2005-06-30T15:31:00.000Z	DukGalNamu	seifu	try to up the power output of the base station
2005-06-30T15:31:00.000Z	seifu		DukalNamu... card work[ed]  fine under XP, base station output is already at max
2005-06-30T15:32:00.000Z	seifu	Seveas	i think it's the association... i'm using an airport extreme/ airport express WDS network

2005-06-30T15:34:00.000Z	seifu		yeah, DukGalNamu, i'm not a newbie, so definitely know i've followed the guides, stuff works nicely... my network currently hosts about 6 other machines/ net devices... stuff's configured and working nice, just ubuntu that's not paying ball
