2010-02-23T04:04:00.000Z	Screamo_Smurf		Im still lost on how to browse my windows share :(
2010-02-23T04:05:00.000Z	Screamo_Smurf		i dont want to mount it permantly
2010-02-23T04:05:00.000Z	Typos_King	Screamo_Smurf	    do you have a 'connect to server' menu in your system?
2010-02-23T04:08:00.000Z	Typos_King	Screamo_Smurf	   how about connect to server -> click places > connect to server?
2010-02-23T04:09:00.000Z	Screamo_Smurf	Typos_King	ive tried that
2010-02-23T04:09:00.000Z	Typos_King	Screamo_Smurf	   is the same in *nix... your use the 198.*   ip in the filesystem menu
2010-02-23T04:10:00.000Z	Typos_King	Screamo_Smurf	    if you choose from the list 'Windows Share' and click on 'Browse Network', doesn't it show something there?
2010-02-23T04:11:00.000Z	Screamo_Smurf	Typos_King	i dont see a browse network
2010-02-23T04:12:00.000Z	Typos_King	Screamo_Smurf	  'browse network' button, next to the 'cancel' and 'connect', at the same spot of Click Places > Connect to server
2010-02-23T04:13:00.000Z	Screamo_Smurf	Typos_King	all thats there is help, cancel and connect
2010-02-23T04:13:00.000Z	Typos_King	Screamo_Smurf	   what about checking for the IP address in 'ipconfig'?
2010-02-23T04:15:00.000Z	Typos_King	Screamo_Smurf	   try entering THAT in your server to connect to then
2010-02-23T04:16:00.000Z	Screamo_Smurf	Typos_King	still nothin
2010-02-23T04:20:00.000Z	Typos_King	Screamo_Smurf	   tis being a samba share, right?
2010-02-23T04:21:00.000Z	Screamo_Smurf	Typos_King	i guess, stand windows network share thing
2010-02-23T04:26:00.000Z	Typos_King	Screamo_Smurf	   it'd look as if you don't have samba or added any samba shares for your win share
2010-02-23T04:27:00.000Z	Typos_King	Screamo_Smurf	  the fact you may have it installed and setup in the win32 partition, means nothing to any other installated OS
2010-02-23T04:44:00.000Z	Screamo_Smurf	Typos_King	is samba built into windows xp?
2010-02-23T04:45:00.000Z	Typos_King	Screamo_Smurf	   no, but some other networking package may have installed if you had the network hooked up at the time you installed it
