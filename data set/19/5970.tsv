2008-10-06T16:31:00.000Z	BonezAU	ikonia	I have been asking in +1 for the last hour with no response so I just thought i'd try here in case anyone could help me...
2008-10-06T16:31:00.000Z	ikonia	BonezAU	+1 is the place, be patient people will get to you
2008-10-06T16:32:00.000Z	BonezAU	ikonia	no probs, thanks. ActionParsnip - i've used the last 3 beta's of Ubuntu with less problems than I can count on my both hands. I don't mind running in to trouble, it helps me learn how and why things break.
2008-12-10T17:00:00.000Z	ikonia	BonezAU	does lsbu still show a device
2008-12-10T17:00:00.000Z	ikonia	BonezAU	which services did you stop
2008-12-10T17:00:00.000Z	ikonia	BonezAU	lsusb sorry
2008-12-10T17:01:00.000Z	BonezAU	ikonia	yes, but networkmanager wont detect my usb wireless card and if i put a 2gb usb flash stick in it also does not automatically mount. dmesg shows the devices as being connected though
2008-12-10T17:01:00.000Z	BonezAU	ikonia	i don't remember - that is the problem.... !! :(
2008-12-10T17:01:00.000Z	ikonia	BonezAU	sounds like hal and dbus
2008-12-10T17:02:00.000Z	BonezAU	ikonia	both hal and dbus are running at runlevel 5, is there any other run levels they need to be active at?
2008-12-10T17:02:00.000Z	ikonia	BonezAU	thats a problem then
2008-12-10T17:02:00.000Z	ikonia	BonezAU	ubuntu doesn't use run level 5
2008-12-10T17:02:00.000Z	ikonia	BonezAU	ubuntu only uses run level 1 and 2 now
2008-12-10T17:02:00.000Z	BonezAU	ikonia	which is 'boot to x' is that runlevel 2?
2008-12-10T17:02:00.000Z	ikonia	BonezAU	yes thats run level 2
2008-12-10T17:02:00.000Z	BonezAU	ikonia	awesome. brb i am going to make some changes and reboot. thanks!
2008-12-10T17:04:00.000Z	BonezAU	ikonia	hal and dbus were running at runlevels 2, 3, 4, 5 but networking was only running at 4 and 5... maybe that is the problem
2008-12-10T17:05:00.000Z	ikonia	BonezAU	well possibly, but that doesn't explain usb not automounting
