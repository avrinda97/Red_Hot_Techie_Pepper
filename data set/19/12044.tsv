2006-01-01T10:20:00.000Z	NoWhereMan		now, the question :D
2006-01-01T10:20:00.000Z	NoWhereMan		I don't know what I did
2006-01-01T10:20:00.000Z	NoWhereMan		but now when I click in Synaptic
2006-01-01T10:21:00.000Z	NoWhereMan		the settings > Packages Repositories (sorry localized version here)
2006-01-01T10:21:00.000Z	NoWhereMan		this just refresh the list as in edit > refresh
2006-01-01T10:22:00.000Z	NoWhereMan		also, the update manager icon near the clock doesn't popup its window anymore
2006-01-01T10:22:00.000Z	NoWhereMan		so the add application in Application menu
2006-01-01T10:22:00.000Z	NoWhereMan		and i noticed the Device Manager, too O__O
2006-01-01T10:23:00.000Z	NoWhereMan		actually many gnome apps... plus synaptic O_O
2006-01-01T10:23:00.000Z	NoWhereMan		what's up?
2006-01-01T10:24:00.000Z	ardchoille	NoWhereMan	you seem to be naming apps, but what is the actual problem? Do they all crash? Do they all set your house on fire?
2006-01-01T10:25:00.000Z	NoWhereMan	ardchoille	lol, no they just don't show up they silently fail
2006-01-01T10:25:00.000Z	NoWhereMan		excepted synaptic
2006-01-01T10:25:00.000Z	NoWhereMan		that have this strange behaviour when i click on settngs > package repository (or archive) same as edit> refresh Oo
2006-01-01T10:26:00.000Z	ardchoille	NoWhereMan	run them from a term and see if there is any error output
2006-01-01T10:27:00.000Z	NoWhereMan		ok, let's see
2006-01-01T10:29:00.000Z	NoWhereMan	ardchoille	acc, you're right: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/6231
2006-01-01T10:33:00.000Z	NoWhereMan	ardchoille	what do you think I shoul do? http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/6231
2006-01-01T10:34:00.000Z	ardchoille	NoWhereMan	it appears to me that you are missing something, but I am not sure what that is. I would post this info and that output to ubuntuforums.org.
