2005-07-30T13:55:00.000Z	slask3n_	dabaR	how do i boot into safemode in ubuntu?
2005-07-30T13:55:00.000Z	dabaR	slask3n_	ya, you should reboot, and choose some form of asfe mode.
2005-07-30T13:56:00.000Z	slask3n_	dabaR	its a slow computer, so it takes a while to boot..
2005-07-30T13:57:00.000Z	dabaR	slask3n_	well, cant helo you there.
2005-07-30T13:58:00.000Z	slask3n_	dabaR	"Ubuntu, kernel 2.6.10-5-386 (recovery mode)" in GRUB i guess? yes its hoary and i just add it in visudo, so can i fix it later if i need to
2005-07-30T13:59:00.000Z	dabaR	slask3n_	yes, looks about right. in hoary, you dont need to edit the sudoers file. Just add the user to the admin group, I believe.
2005-07-30T14:00:00.000Z	slask3n_	dabaR	how do i do that? its console and ive only added users in the graphical tools
2005-07-30T14:03:00.000Z	slask3n_	dabaR	are there any wy to disable the recovery mode, or at least password protect it some way
