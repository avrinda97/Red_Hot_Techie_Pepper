2012-11-04T07:13:00.000Z	wallythemoose		Question: I replaced a raid array in windows with a 3tb seagate hard drive, since Ubuntu was not playing well with the software raid. Normally Ubuntu would see an NTFS partition fine, but when I copied the data over to the new 3tb drive in windows, I had to initialize the drive as GPT, instead of MBR. As a result, Ubuntu fails to see a 3tb (more like 2.7tb) NTFS partition, it shows as unallocated. Is there any trick to getting
2012-11-04T07:14:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wallythemoose	The problem is that it's using GPT (Ubuntu supports GPT just fine) the problem is that the partition table is invalid.
2012-11-04T07:14:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wallythemoose	Please pastebin the output of "sudo parted -l".

2012-11-04T07:19:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wallythemoose	Note there the error "Error: Can't have a partition outside the disk!" which means that one of your disks has an entry in the partition table saying that a partition ends past the actual end of the disk.
2012-11-04T07:20:00.000Z	wallythemoose	Jordan_U	Is it possible that windows did not create the partition table correctly and I should do it from gparted instead?
2012-11-04T07:20:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wallythemoose	I've been seeing a lot of those recently, but I have no idea what tool is doing such a silly thing. Do you have any idea how your partition table might have become invalid in this way? Did you use any odd partitioning tools?
2012-11-04T07:20:00.000Z	wallythemoose	Jordan_U	I used windows 7 built in partition manager
2012-11-04T07:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wallythemoose	Very odd and surprising then. The utility "fixparts" should fix your partition table for you: http://www.rodsbooks.com/fixparts/
2012-11-04T07:22:00.000Z	wallythemoose	Jordan_U	thanks, I will try that.
2012-11-04T07:22:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wallythemoose	You're welcome.
2012-11-04T07:43:00.000Z	wallythemoose	Jordan_U	It turns out that fixparts is only for MBR disks, it says to use parted or GPT fdisk on it.
2012-11-04T07:44:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wallythemoose	Then use "gdisk" (which is by the same developer as fixparts).
2012-11-04T07:46:00.000Z	wallythemoose	Jordan_U	Thanks, I just realized that. Doh'
2012-11-04T07:46:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wallythemoose	You're welcome.
2012-11-04T08:08:00.000Z	wallythemoose	Jordan_U	So I decided to bite the bullet and just repartition the drive and copy back all of the data, but it turns out that Ubuntu doesn't like Window's GPT partition table, and Window's doesn't like Ubuntu's (or should I say GParted) GPT partition table. Drats!
2012-11-04T08:46:00.000Z	wallythemoose	Jordan_U	I tried to use Gdisk from both windows 7 and ubuntu, and still each refuses to see the other's partition table that they made... I may have to settle for MBR and a 2tb partition
2012-11-04T10:38:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wallythemoose	One possible theory is that what you think is a single drive (and was advertised as a single drive) is really a FakeRAID of some type. Do you see more disks listed in Ubuntu that in Windows?
2012-11-04T10:41:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wallythemoose	For example if the the RAID array has a stripe size of one MiB, then the first MiB of one of the drives will be the same as the first MiB of the array, and so when looking at that drive alone it will appear to have a GPT label with invalid partition definitions (because it's really describing the array rather than that individual drive).
