2008-03-29T02:25:00.000Z	unop	Teoz	oh yes, you can go out for a couple of hours atleast
2008-03-29T02:25:00.000Z	unop	Teoz	how man gigabytes of data?
2008-03-29T02:25:00.000Z	Teoz	unop	approx 10
2008-03-29T02:26:00.000Z	Teoz	unop	approx 10GB
2008-03-29T02:26:00.000Z	unop	Teoz	and how many files ?
2008-03-29T02:26:00.000Z	Teoz	unop	something like 6000
2008-03-29T02:26:00.000Z	unop	Teoz	yea, i'd say atleast a couple of hours
2008-03-29T02:27:00.000Z	Teoz	unop	craaaaaaaaaaazy duuuuuuuude... all right then.. well, I am guessing there is no other shorter way.. oh yeah, do you have any of where Ubuntu stores the commands it accepts in the Terminal ?
2008-03-29T02:27:00.000Z	unop	Teoz	well, maybe it wasnt a good idea, but errm, if it has to be verified, it has to be
2008-03-29T02:28:00.000Z	Teoz	unop	like, the "cat" command or the "md5sum" command ?
2008-03-29T02:28:00.000Z	unop	Teoz	there are faster ways, but less reliable -- command history is in ~/.bash_history
2008-03-29T02:28:00.000Z	Teoz	unop	that does, tell size ?
2008-03-29T02:28:00.000Z	unop	Teoz	you could use md5sum in place of sha1sum and the command will still work, it will only be marginally faster tho and could be less reliable
2008-03-29T02:29:00.000Z	unop	Teoz	errm, tell size??
2008-03-29T02:29:00.000Z	Teoz	unop	I mean, does it only confirm the size of the folder/files it wrote down ? I am just wondering what the history stores
2008-03-29T02:30:00.000Z	unop	Teoz	it computes the sha1 sum of the file .. the output is destined to /tmp/source and /tmp/dest
2008-03-29T02:31:00.000Z	Teoz	unop	cool good to know, thanks, also I am still curious :P, where does Ubuntu store the commands that Terminal accepts ?
2008-03-29T02:32:00.000Z	unop	Teoz	if you use bash (which is default) history goes in ~/.bash_history
2008-03-29T02:34:00.000Z	Teoz	unop	thanks for the answer !
