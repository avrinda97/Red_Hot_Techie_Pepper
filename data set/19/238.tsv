2012-06-03T03:14:00.000Z	MrJrSr		Guys, i got a problem with My Wifi Card, (Centrino Wireless-N 1030) and when i connect it is very very slow (no more than 50kB/s) while my internet goes over 500kB/s
2012-06-03T03:15:00.000Z	MrJrSr		i am using Ubuntu Precise AMD64
2012-06-03T03:15:00.000Z	MrJrSr		could you please help me?
2012-06-03T03:17:00.000Z	Jameson	MrJrSr	did you try this wifi with other device?
2012-06-03T03:18:00.000Z	MrJrSr	Jameson	yes, in the same computer, on another OS
2012-06-03T03:18:00.000Z	MrJrSr	Jameson	it works fine
2012-06-03T03:20:00.000Z	MrJrSr	Jameson	it "works" on Precise AMD64 too, but it is very slow...
2012-06-03T03:21:00.000Z	MrJrSr	Jameson	 in order to get it faster on the other OS i had to disable N-Mode
2012-06-03T03:21:00.000Z	MrJrSr	Jameson	but seems it don't work here
2012-06-03T03:22:00.000Z	Jameson	MrJrSr	hmm... sounds wierd,
2012-06-03T03:23:00.000Z	MrJrSr	Jameson	maybe the wireless router don't works very well with n-mode
2012-06-03T03:23:00.000Z	MrJrSr	Jameson	but since i have no admin account on the router i have no other choice than make it works that way
2012-06-03T03:25:00.000Z	Jameson	MrJrSr	 hmm.. maybe ...  did you try reinstal wifi driver ?
2012-06-03T03:26:00.000Z	MrJrSr		yes

2012-06-03T03:26:00.000Z	MrJrSr		and disabling n-mode
2012-06-03T03:26:00.000Z	MrJrSr		and disabling bluetooth
2012-06-03T03:30:00.000Z	MrJrSr	Jameson	did you have any clue?
