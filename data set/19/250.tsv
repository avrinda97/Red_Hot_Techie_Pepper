2012-05-23T07:38:00.000Z	dsf900		look at (I think) /etc/security/conf/limits.h
2012-05-23T07:38:00.000Z	dsf900		Or something like that
2012-05-23T07:38:00.000Z	dsf900		errr....
2012-05-23T07:38:00.000Z	dsf900		/etc/security/limits.conf maybe
2012-05-23T07:39:00.000Z	dsf900		You can see which groups/users have permission to set high (real-time) priorities
2012-05-23T07:40:00.000Z	dsf900		yeah, limits.conf I think only defines limits for users and groups
2012-05-23T07:40:00.000Z	dsf900		The easy way to test it is to run pulseaudio with sudo
2012-05-23T07:41:00.000Z	dsf900		But, be careful, any priority greater than zero will run with priority greater than that of the kernel
2012-05-23T07:41:00.000Z	dsf900		I.e. any of the real-time priorities
2012-05-23T07:42:00.000Z	dsf900		So it's possible for software bugs to (almost) totally halt your system... there's a absolute cap by default, but it's something like 1% or 0.1% of total processing time
2012-05-23T07:43:00.000Z	escott	dsf900	you have your priorities all wrong. default is 0 19 is lowest priority -20 is highest and one of those high priorities(maybe -20 or -21) is realtime
2012-05-23T07:45:00.000Z	dsf900	escott	sorry, I'm playing fast and loose
2012-05-23T07:48:00.000Z	dsf900	escott	on the API side, real-time priorities are guaranteed to be from something like 1 to 20, but typically linux supports 1 to 99
2012-05-23T07:48:00.000Z	dsf900		all real-time priorities are positive, and any real-time priority takes precedence over any non-real-time process
2012-05-23T07:49:00.000Z	escott	dsf900	ok im not too familiar with the rt side of things just the confusing "nice" levels
2012-05-23T07:49:00.000Z	dsf900		You're correct, in that lower nice values are higher priority
2012-05-23T07:49:00.000Z	dsf900		Yeah, honestly I'm not too familiar with the nice priorities
2012-05-23T07:49:00.000Z	dsf900		Different strokes for different folks, I suppose
2012-05-23T07:50:00.000Z	escott	dsf900	-20 to 19 lower is higher, higher is lower, up is down, down is up, good is bad, bad is BAD
