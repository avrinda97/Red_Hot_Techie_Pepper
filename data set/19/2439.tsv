2010-04-11T19:43:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	BlaDe^	what are you trying to accomplish?
2010-04-11T19:44:00.000Z	BlaDe^	bastid_raZor	 even on the performance setting if my CPU is at 100% usage it's runing at 1.14GHz
2010-04-11T19:45:00.000Z	BlaDe^	bastid_raZor	 any ideas?
2010-04-11T19:46:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	BlaDe^	how are you monitoring your cpu speeds?
2010-04-11T19:48:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	BlaDe^	cpufreq-info   type that into a terminal.  does the `available cpu frequency steps` match to what your processor can do?
2010-04-11T19:50:00.000Z	BlaDe^	bastid_raZor	 it says that the performance policy can use between 800MHz and 1.14GHz, how do I adjust the policies?
2010-04-11T19:51:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	BlaDe^	cpufreq-set     and the syntax  -f/--freq, -d/--min, -u/--max
2010-04-11T20:00:00.000Z	BlaDe^	bastid_raZor	 when using: root@martin-laptop:/# cpufreq-set -f 1.9GHz  ( I believe that's what the selector in the panel item does anyway), it goes straight to 800MHz
2010-04-11T20:03:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	BlaDe^	i think you're using the syntax wrong -f is to set which to use .. Ghz or Mhz  the -d and -u will set min and max .. for example cpufreq-set -f Ghz -m 1.0 -u 1.9
2010-04-11T20:03:00.000Z	BlaDe^	bastid_raZor	 http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/How_to_use_cpufrequtils#Examples
2010-04-11T20:05:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	BlaDe^	which governor are you using? that page indicates `userspace` needs to be used to set a constant frequency
2010-04-11T20:06:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	BlaDe^	cpufreq-info tells which you're using.
2010-04-11T20:07:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	BlaDe^	current policy:
2010-04-11T20:08:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	BlaDe^	possibly you should be using sudo from your user instead of root shell.. that means userspace is your current governor
2010-04-11T20:10:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	BlaDe^	after setting that does cpufreq-info give different information on `current CPU fequency is ..`
2010-04-11T20:12:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	BlaDe^	i don't know a solution. i just know (supposedly) how to set the frequency. not sure why it isn't working for you.
2010-04-11T20:12:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	BlaDe^	do you possibly have more than on CPU or is it more than on core?
2010-04-11T20:13:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	BlaDe^	yeah, that was my next guess.
2010-04-11T20:22:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	BlaDe^	 /usr/share/doc/gnome-applets-data/README.Debian  read this.. it tells about cpufreq issues in karmic and has a suggestion on how to fix
