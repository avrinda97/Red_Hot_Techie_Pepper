2008-02-15T21:46:00.000Z	maximilion_	ztf	had Ubuntu 5 days now, once, it refused to play sound (required ctrl+alt+bksp), usb harddisk keeps spinning after shutdown, pidgin started but showed no window and couldn't be started again, occasional file dialog hiccups
2008-02-15T21:46:00.000Z	ztf	maximilion_	what release did you install, 7.10 or 8 ?
2008-02-15T21:46:00.000Z	maximilion_	ztf	but I think it will be fine, and I love it :) Some of these might be app quirks, too.
2008-02-15T21:47:00.000Z	maximilion_	ztf	7.10 from ubuntu.com
2008-02-15T21:47:00.000Z	ztf	maximilion_	apps work fine on most computers, but maybe you've got somme buggy or unsupported hardware, isn't there anything strange in, roughly, dmesg, syslog, messages ?
2008-02-15T21:48:00.000Z	maximilion_	ztf	well, I'm comparing to XP x64 on the same computer ;)
2008-02-15T21:48:00.000Z	ztf	maximilion_	so i guess you installed the 7.10 for x64 hardware, is it ?
2008-02-15T21:49:00.000Z	maximilion_	ztf	No, I was recommended to install 32-bit, since much 64-bit stuff needs some ironing out
2008-02-15T21:49:00.000Z	ztf	maximilion_	i don't have that muche experience on x64 but i'd try x64 distro now, regarding the bugs you encounter on x32
2008-02-15T21:50:00.000Z	maximilion_	ztf	no error messages - except when sound failed. Just the one occurance, sound works flawlessly in every game and app I've installed
2008-02-15T21:50:00.000Z	ztf	maximilion_	what's the message when sound fails ?
2008-02-15T21:50:00.000Z	maximilion_	ztf	nah, I feel it's a very stable system.
2008-02-15T21:50:00.000Z	maximilion_	ztf	remember I've been installing and experimenting with stuff all these 5 days
2008-02-15T21:51:00.000Z	ztf	maximilion_	sure, i'm simply not that much sharp on x64, maybe there're some traps on this
2008-02-15T21:51:00.000Z	maximilion_	ztf	I wrote the msg here two days ago, got no help, checked myself, decided not to bother and pressed ctrl+alt+bksp :)
2008-02-15T21:52:00.000Z	maximilion_	ztf	my biggest issue really with Ubuntu is that the mouse settings are veery few... should be luxurious for us who use it in our work !
2008-02-15T21:53:00.000Z	ztf	maximilion_	you mean, mouse with more than 2 buttons etc ?
2008-02-15T21:54:00.000Z	maximilion_	ztf	Yes, can you imagine that!? :P
2008-02-15T21:54:00.000Z	ztf	maximilion_	that's beyond belief ;)
