2008-03-31T21:17:00.000Z	|Dede|		as a root:
2008-03-31T21:17:00.000Z	|Dede|		wow... im dumb :S
2008-03-31T21:18:00.000Z	|Dede|		ty Lamego
2008-03-31T21:19:00.000Z	|Dede|		okay I do now know why, but the chown command does not do what it should! all the files in /logs/ are root
2008-03-31T21:19:00.000Z	|Dede|		(2 files)
2008-03-31T21:19:00.000Z	|Dede|		although I ran chown unreal:unreal *
2008-03-31T21:19:00.000Z	|Dede|		in that directory
2008-03-31T21:20:00.000Z	|Dede|		those 2 files won't lose the root
2008-03-31T21:20:00.000Z	|Dede|		any idea how to force 'em to?
2008-03-31T21:21:00.000Z	|Dede|		user = group?
2008-03-31T21:21:00.000Z	zcat[1]	|Dede|	you might want to look in the logrotate config, it defines ownership and permission of the new logfiles after it rotates the old ones
2008-03-31T21:27:00.000Z	zcat[1]	|Dede|	sudo chown -R user:group /directory   -- no /*
2008-03-31T21:28:00.000Z	zcat[1]	|Dede|	is the directory 'logs' in the current directory, or actually /logs off the root directory?
2008-03-31T21:29:00.000Z	zcat[1]	|Dede|	sudo chown -R user:group directory  -- no leading / if it's relative to the directory you're in now.
2008-03-31T21:31:00.000Z	zcat[1]	|Dede|	yes
2008-03-31T21:32:00.000Z	zcat[1]	|Dede|	user and group 'unreal' exists?
2008-03-31T21:34:00.000Z	zcat[1]	|Dede|	it doesn't have to be
2008-03-31T21:34:00.000Z	zcat[1]	|Dede|	try changing just the owner: sudo chown -R unreal logs
2008-03-31T21:41:00.000Z	zcat[1]	|Dede|	is 'logs' a directory, or a link to some other place?
