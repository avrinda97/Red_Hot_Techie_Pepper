2005-09-16T16:56:00.000Z	cafuego	selinium	or 'sudo shutdown -h now'
2005-11-07T17:26:00.000Z	selinium	cafuego	Can you create a new partition from a partially full partition?
2005-11-07T17:30:00.000Z	selinium	cafuego	tried to get p8ntKid to backup before resizing his partition... but he laft too quick
2005-11-07T17:30:00.000Z	cafuego	selinium	Well, it will either work or he'll learn a valuable lesson. It's a win either way.
2005-11-07T17:30:00.000Z	selinium	cafuego	indeed! :)
2005-11-07T17:31:00.000Z	cafuego	selinium	99 out of 100 times resizing wotks fine though.
2005-11-07T17:31:00.000Z	selinium	cafuego	I dont think he had any room to create a backup anyway.... :)
2005-11-10T16:37:00.000Z	selinium	cafuego	i think you can get flash now in 64bit
2005-11-10T16:37:00.000Z	cafuego	selinium	Yes, it happily crashes firefox.
2005-11-10T16:37:00.000Z	selinium	cafuego	Didn't know, not tried iut myself! :)
2005-11-10T16:37:00.000Z	cafuego	selinium	it gets really annoying when FF crashes each timr you happen to come across a page with a flasha d banner or something :-(
