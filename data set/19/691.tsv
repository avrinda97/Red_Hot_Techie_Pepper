2011-10-24T15:30:00.000Z	rikutake	ActionParsnip	which would you recommend?
2011-10-24T15:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rikutake	can you give a PASTEBIN of the output of:  lsb_release -a; uname -a; dpkg -l | egrep 'flash|gnash|swf'
2011-10-24T15:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rikutake	I may be able to help clear up your flash issue
2011-10-24T15:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rikutake	sudo dpkg -P flashplugin-installer    will clean that up
2011-10-24T15:32:00.000Z	rikutake	ActionParsnip	clean what up? would you mind telling me whats wrong?
2011-10-24T15:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rikutake	the flash package has left residual config
2011-10-24T15:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rikutake	how did you install flash?
2011-10-24T15:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rikutake	yes but via what method?
2011-10-24T15:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rikutake	I see
2011-10-24T15:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rikutake	it's not showing. I suggest you enable the partner repo and you should see adobe-flashplugin, install that and it will give 64bit flash
2011-10-24T15:34:00.000Z	rikutake	ActionParsnip	sure. So you dont recommend any open source alternatives?
2011-10-24T15:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rikutake	lightspark gets some good reviews
2011-10-24T15:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rikutake	remember to remove the other flash plugin you have installed
2011-10-24T15:37:00.000Z	rikutake	ActionParsnip	but i just purged it?
2011-10-24T15:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rikutake	if you manually copied a file to the plugins folder of your browser you will need to delete that too
2011-10-24T15:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rikutake	should be ok then
2011-10-24T15:40:00.000Z	rikutake	ActionParsnip	thanks a lot for your help
