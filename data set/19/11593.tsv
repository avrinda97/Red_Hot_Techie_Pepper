2005-12-26T14:05:00.000Z	_jason	Shadyman	april
2006-01-23T07:36:00.000Z	Shadyman	_jason	Thanks
2006-01-23T08:46:00.000Z	_jason	Shadyman	I have searched for that and been very unsuccessfull, I would suggest creating a custom command.  Ubotu will send you a link
2006-01-23T09:21:00.000Z	Shadyman	_jason	Sorry, it's not quite what i was looking for.
2006-01-23T09:22:00.000Z	_jason	Shadyman	sorry, what isn't/
2006-01-23T09:22:00.000Z	Shadyman	_jason	The "keyboard shortcuts" thing
2006-01-23T09:23:00.000Z	_jason	Shadyman	hrmm I must have misunderstood.  Didn't you want a shortcut you could start your media player with?
2006-01-23T09:23:00.000Z	Shadyman	_jason	I already have a shortcut to start my media player. That came with Ubuntu. I just want to change what it starts.
2006-01-23T09:24:00.000Z	_jason	Shadyman	yes, I wanted to do this once.  I couldn't find out how.  I finally resolved that I would instead create a new shortcut that opens the media player of my choice.  Basically the same thing just not as 'clean'
2006-01-23T09:25:00.000Z	Shadyman	_jason	Yeah, only thing is, I know i changed it from XMMS to rhythmbox, it can't be that hard.
2006-01-23T09:25:00.000Z	Shadyman	_jason	Maybe i'll grep my log files.
2006-01-23T09:25:00.000Z	_jason	Shadyman	really?  I thought default was rythmbox
2006-01-23T09:26:00.000Z	Shadyman	_jason	Oh, might be when i played with another hotkeys app then
2006-01-23T09:36:00.000Z	Shadyman	_jason	Well, Maybe i can live with rhythmbox, even though it doesn't let me change file tags./
2006-01-23T09:36:00.000Z	_jason	Shadyman	or you can create a new shortcut :), or if you really want a hack, change the binary :)
2006-01-23T09:37:00.000Z	Shadyman	_jason	hehe. is it just me or does rhythmbox also not sync to ipods?
2006-01-23T09:37:00.000Z	_jason	Shadyman	no idea on that one
