2009-04-26T13:59:00.000Z	sirius		well, anyone ? some ideeas ?....
2009-04-26T13:59:00.000Z	JockyWilson	sirius	you got an old nvidia card?
2009-04-26T14:00:00.000Z	sirius	JockyWilson	yes
2009-04-26T14:02:00.000Z	JockyWilson	sirius	ime older nvidia cards = you have to manually tweak xorg.conf to get them running with all the resolutions
2009-04-26T14:02:00.000Z	sirius	JockyWilson	and how do I do that ?
2009-04-26T14:04:00.000Z	JockyWilson	sirius	1. sudo apt-get install envyng-core 2. sudo envyng -t 3. select recomended
2009-04-26T14:05:00.000Z	sirius	JockyWilson	ok, I'll try now
2009-04-26T14:09:00.000Z	sirius	JockyWilson	 should I install the 71 or the 96 ?
2009-04-26T14:09:00.000Z	JockyWilson	sirius	what is the nvidia card model?
2009-04-26T14:13:00.000Z	JockyWilson	sirius	did you install the driver envyng recommended
2009-04-26T14:15:00.000Z	JockyWilson	sirius	you are probably going to have to tweak xorg.conf to get ALL the resolutions. You stuck with 800x600?
2009-04-26T14:16:00.000Z	sirius	JockyWilson	yes, I'm stuck with 800 X 600
2009-04-26T14:25:00.000Z	JockyWilson	sirius	did you install the driver envyng recommended?
2009-04-26T14:29:00.000Z	sirius	JockyWilson	Ubuntu 9.04
2009-04-26T14:29:00.000Z	JockyWilson	sirius	sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf. Look at the Section "Monitor" I added HorizSync      30.0 - 70.0   VertRefresh    60.0 to get an old nvidia card to display all the resolutions
2009-04-26T14:30:00.000Z	sirius	JockyWilson	i'm testing that now
2009-04-26T14:36:00.000Z	sirius	JockyWilson	Thank you very much ! it solved the problem ! Now I have all the resolution I needed !!
2009-04-26T14:37:00.000Z	sirius	JockyWilson	no
2009-04-26T14:37:00.000Z	sirius	JockyWilson	it is resolved, thank you :)
