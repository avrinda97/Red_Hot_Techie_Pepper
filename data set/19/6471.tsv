2011-01-09T16:43:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve		Damn it
2011-01-09T16:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	q_a_z_steve	factoids don't have spaces
2011-01-09T16:44:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	ActionParsnip	example, please?
2011-01-09T16:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	q_a_z_steve	what do you want to know?
2011-01-09T16:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	q_a_z_steve	what about it?
2011-01-09T16:46:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	ActionParsnip	I need to find a way, lucid I guess, at this point possibly, of getting version 2.20.1
2011-01-09T16:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	q_a_z_steve	binutils 2.20.1 is in the lucid repos
2011-08-14T04:53:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	ActionParsnip	Have you ever loaded natty toram?
2011-08-14T04:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	q_a_z_steve	not personally
2012-10-30T19:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	q_a_z_steve	did you MD5 test the iSO you downloaded?
2012-10-30T19:51:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	ActionParsnip	yes, I'm actually using a DSL iso and did the conversion to dmg and all that.
2012-10-30T19:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	q_a_z_steve	why do you need to convert the ISO, just install unetbootin and you can throw the ISO at it and it will be made into a bootable USB stick
2012-10-30T19:53:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	ActionParsnip	instructions on ubuntu.com say convert using hdiutil, then dd to push
2012-10-30T20:09:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	ActionParsnip	trying to avoid another install of software if I can. UnetBootIn looks cute though.
2012-10-30T20:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	q_a_z_steve	its dead handy. Make your USB with that and you should be fine. Its a tiny app
2012-10-30T20:10:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	ActionParsnip	at that rate why can't diskUtility.app work???
