2011-05-24T12:01:00.000Z	virion		ha
2011-05-24T12:02:00.000Z	virion		seriously though.. linux has been turning me off.. i've gotten kernal panick too many times, freezing, and a multitude of other issues..
2011-05-24T12:02:00.000Z	virion		i am willing
2011-05-24T12:02:00.000Z	virion		it's still been turning me off to it though..
2011-05-24T12:03:00.000Z	virion		and i'd rather go back to windows HPC server
2011-05-24T12:03:00.000Z	virion		or server 2008 r2
2011-05-24T12:03:00.000Z	virion		vague?
2011-05-24T12:03:00.000Z	virion		reinstall isn't going to help me find the problem
2011-05-24T12:04:00.000Z	virion		and i've used google. sadly when i had kubuntu i would follow threads that said to use certain commands that when i ran them in terminal didn't do anything
2011-05-24T12:04:00.000Z	virion		i said other reasons such as programs not launching, system freezing
2011-05-24T12:04:00.000Z	Jordan_U	virion	sed 's#/some/path/#g#'
2011-05-24T12:05:00.000Z	Jordan_U	virion	Sorry, it's late :) make that: sed 's#/some/path/#/something/else#g'
2011-05-24T12:07:00.000Z	Jordan_U	virion	Can you pastebin the output of "listen" from the terminal?
2011-05-24T12:07:00.000Z	Jordan_U	virion	The command to run listen is literally "listen".
2011-05-24T12:08:00.000Z	Jordan_U	virion	Sorry, I keep getting your nick mixed up with viks' .
2011-05-24T12:09:00.000Z	Jordan_U	virion	*never* run a command using sudo unless you're absolutely sure that the command is supposed to be run as root. (Just seeing a permissions error is *not* enough to know that).
2011-05-24T12:14:00.000Z	Jordan_U	virion	Try running this command in the terminal "mv ~/.config/listen/ ~/.config/listen-bak/" then try opening listen again. (That command will rename the directory containing listen's configuration file, causing it to create a new one).
2011-05-24T12:16:00.000Z	Jordan_U	virion	It worked because listen's configuration file had some type of problem, and as I explained renaming the directory containing listen's configuration will cause listen to create a new configuration directory with default settings.
2011-05-24T12:18:00.000Z	Jordan_U	virion	Which means that you have probably lost any settings you changed in listen (though the old configuration file still exists, to get your settings back you'd need to discover what exactly is wrong with it that is causing listen to fail).
