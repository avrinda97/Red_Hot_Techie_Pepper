2011-06-30T14:50:00.000Z	casey_		Hey guys! I need some help with Grub2. It seems that everytime I log into WIndows, I have an important update to install. This update requires a reboot of the system which I do everytime. However, for whatever reason, this seems to break my Grub2 as it tries to load, fails, and then returns to BIOS only to happen again. Any ideas?
2011-06-30T14:51:00.000Z	casey_		but i shall try.
2011-06-30T14:51:00.000Z	envygeeks	casey_	load up the live cd and reinstall grub, Windows updates can overwrite the MBR
2011-06-30T14:51:00.000Z	casey_	envygeeks	Unfortunately, thats what i do everytime. But I would like to correct this problem so i can finally install those updates on windows AND reboot to successfully complete them.
2011-06-30T14:52:00.000Z	envygeeks	casey_	that's never going to happen, that's the nature of Windows, you'll just have to reinstall grub everytime Windows updates, been like that for years and there is no way to stop it
2011-06-30T14:53:00.000Z	casey_	envygeeks	Really? Well its not a very good condition considering that everytime i log into windows, it breaks my grub. It seems to me that having windows on my comp is pointless if its always going to break it?
2011-06-30T14:53:00.000Z	envygeeks	casey_	I guess you could do superblock install of Grub into the partition and use Windows bootloader to boot to the Linux partition that would fix it, but meh  too much trouble
2011-06-30T14:55:00.000Z	casey_	envygeeks	Yeah I dont think that sounds like too much fun. I'm just sick of putting in that dang LiveCD only to type in the two same command line prompts so i can get Ubuntu back. But hey maybe you can solve my only need for going into windows. 1. Is there any program/way to print borderless documents (specifically pictures) in ubuntu?
2011-06-30T14:57:00.000Z	envygeeks	casey_	F-Spot should be able to do borderless printing, that's what I used to do until I Photoshop CS5 came out and we could use it in Wine now
2011-06-30T14:58:00.000Z	casey_	envygeeks	So are you saying that you can print in CS5 as well? Because i love photoshop. My biggest problem is printing borderlessly with custom sizes? Any idea on that?
2011-06-30T15:00:00.000Z	envygeeks	casey_	Yes, I use Photoshop CS5 on Linux to print and edit my photos all of the photos on my flickr profile were edited in Linux using CS5.  I don't know what you mean by Custom size but if you mean paper size that's a matter of the printer driver.
2011-06-30T15:03:00.000Z	casey_	envygeeks	That's exactly what I mean. For example I have some cardstock that is 6.5x10 inches. On default, the options given to me do not fit this size and thus I cannot print borderlessly for this sort of document. Any ideas on how I can solve this?
2011-06-30T15:04:00.000Z	envygeeks	casey_	figure out the PPI, do the math and crop it yourself or ask the driver to crop it F-Spot should be able to crop it to the paper size
2011-06-30T15:06:00.000Z	casey_	envygeeks	Like lets say for example my 6.5x10 document. Where would I go and how would I fix it with that scenario?

2011-06-30T15:08:00.000Z	casey_	envygeeks	Ok I see what you're saying. So where abouts would I enter the calculated PPI value when printing? Is it only on F-Spot or were you referring to the actual printer setting itsel?
2011-06-30T15:10:00.000Z	envygeeks	casey_	it doesn't work like that, once you figure out the PPI you use that to resize the image in pixels to the right dimensions so if you have 1PPI then 1 pixel is 1 inch blah blah blah
2011-06-30T15:11:00.000Z	casey_	envygeeks	I think we got off down another path if i'm mistaken. I'm not wanting to resize photos to a different proportion, i'm wanting to have a selection when it comes to print time that will say "Custom" and allow me to punch in "Width=6 inches" and "Length=10 inches" and so on and so forth. See what i'm saying?
2011-06-30T15:12:00.000Z	casey_	envygeeks	My printer in Windows has the custom printing capability but I cant seem to find out how to do it in Ubuntu.
