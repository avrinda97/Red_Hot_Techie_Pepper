2012-01-05T14:16:00.000Z	Solnse		is there a default setting somehwere for screen orientation? for some reason when I load ubuntu, my screen is upside down until I go to settings and make it "normal" orientation instead of 180 degrees.... no idea why it's stuck on 180 every time.

It just starting doing it 2 days ago after allowing ubuntu to download some updates.
2012-01-05T14:18:00.000Z	almoxarife	Solnse	you never changed the setting to 180?
2012-01-05T14:18:00.000Z	almoxarife	Solnse	are you the only user of that mach?
2012-01-05T14:18:00.000Z	Solnse	almoxarife	it just started happening after I allowed it to update
2012-01-05T14:19:00.000Z	Solnse	almoxarife	yes, only me
2012-01-05T14:19:00.000Z	almoxarife	Solnse	so you are upside down on the log screen?
2012-01-05T14:19:00.000Z	almoxarife	Solnse	so you are upside down on the log /in/screen?
2012-01-05T14:20:00.000Z	Solnse	almoxarife	no... login is fine.... and yes, after I log in, it's upside down... if I reset the orientation to normal, it goes normal, but if I log off and back in, it's upside down again...
2012-01-05T14:21:00.000Z	Solnse	almoxarife	settings>displays
2012-01-05T14:22:00.000Z	almoxarife	Solnse	you got a odd video driver or a driver with its own configuration app?
2012-01-05T14:24:00.000Z	almoxarife	Solnse	but does it have a setting app? and did you make changes to it?
2012-01-05T14:25:00.000Z	Solnse	almoxarife	I didn't manually change anything... I don't think it has a config app... but like I said, some kind of update might be related to this happening.
2012-01-05T14:26:00.000Z	Solnse	almoxarife	is there a config file that stores that default screen orientation i can look at?
2012-01-05T14:27:00.000Z	almoxarife	Solnse	on mine there is, nvidia has it, so does yours? it's a system app, something in the systems menu
2012-01-05T14:33:00.000Z	almoxarife	Solnse	no idea
2012-01-05T14:33:00.000Z	Solnse	almoxarife	there's no default config file that would include orientation?
2012-01-05T14:33:00.000Z	almoxarife	Solnse	no idea
2012-01-05T14:34:00.000Z	Solnse	almoxarife	ok thanks anyway
