2006-07-13T06:26:00.000Z	Jamo		what is automatix and how is it supposed to help me get sun's jdk?
2006-07-13T06:27:00.000Z	Jamo		thank you
2006-07-13T06:27:00.000Z	Jamo		except I"ve already went through that tutorial and it didn't help
2006-07-13T06:28:00.000Z	jrib	Jamo	you want sun-java5-bin right?
2006-07-13T06:28:00.000Z	jrib	Jamo	well what happened?
2006-07-13T06:28:00.000Z	Jamo	jrib	with all repositories checked, still can't find it in the list of packages
2006-07-13T06:29:00.000Z	jrib	Jamo	you know the package name for that?
2006-07-13T06:29:00.000Z	Jamo	jrib	according to the link you sent me it is sun-java5-jdk
2006-07-13T06:29:00.000Z	jrib	Jamo	sun-java5-jdk it seems.  If that doesn't turn up, please pastebin the contents of /etc/apt/sources.list
2006-07-13T06:30:00.000Z	Jamo	jrib	roj
2006-07-13T06:33:00.000Z	Jamo	jrib	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/17874 regarding no sun-java5-jdk package
2006-07-13T06:34:00.000Z	jrib	Jamo	you comfortable editing /etc/apt/sources.list by hand?
2006-07-13T06:35:00.000Z	Jamo	jrib	I am more interested in why this has to be done
2006-07-13T06:35:00.000Z	jrib	Jamo	add " multiverse" to the end of lines 16, 17, 31, and 32: all the lines with "universe" but no "multiverse"
2006-07-13T06:36:00.000Z	jrib	Jamo	I've been meaning to find out why multiverse isn't included in the commented repos, I suppose it may be because it isn't free.  But then you have backports multiverse...
2006-07-13T06:37:00.000Z	jrib	Jamo	those links explain the different components of the repositories, just some info for you
2006-07-13T06:39:00.000Z	Jamo	jrib	thank you! *there is an ubuntu forum result that comes up on google when I search this topic http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=197971 that doesn't exactly explain the fix, I'd mark it up to help the next guy but I"m not exactly sure we fixed it yet
2006-07-13T06:39:00.000Z	jrib	Jamo	nah the last links I had ubotu send you have instructions for adding multiverse
2006-07-13T06:40:00.000Z	Jamo	jrib	righto, I'll leave a message on that topic for the next guy myself then
