2010-05-06T03:24:00.000Z	DeathMetalDean		hi, does anyone know how to get flash on ubuntu 10.04 on 64bit?
2010-05-06T03:25:00.000Z	SealedWithAKiss	DeathMetalDean	wget http://queleimporta.com/downloads/flash10_en.sh
2010-05-06T03:25:00.000Z	SealedWithAKiss	DeathMetalDean	sudo bash ./flash10_en.sh
2010-05-06T03:27:00.000Z	DeathMetalDean	SealedWithAKiss	it says there's no such file or directory whenever I downloaded it and typed the command into the terminal
2010-05-06T03:28:00.000Z	SealedWithAKiss	DeathMetalDean	the file should be in your home folder, make sure that your running the command from your home directory.
2010-05-06T03:28:00.000Z	DeathMetalDean	SealedWithAKiss	it's alright, got it working lol
2010-05-06T03:28:00.000Z	SealedWithAKiss	DeathMetalDean	does flash work now?
2010-05-06T03:28:00.000Z	DeathMetalDean	SealedWithAKiss	dunno yet, it's doing something in the terminal, will let that finish
2010-05-06T03:29:00.000Z	DeathMetalDean	SealedWithAKiss	no, it doesn't work :S
2010-05-06T03:30:00.000Z	SealedWithAKiss	DeathMetalDean	it's not working for me either. I have Ubuntu 10.04 64-bit and I'm trying to get flash working as well. I wanted to see whether the fix that didn't work for me worked for you.
2010-05-06T03:31:00.000Z	DeathMetalDean	SealedWithAKiss	ok, I'll ask my brother about it later, I think he updated too and has flash
2010-05-06T03:31:00.000Z	SealedWithAKiss	DeathMetalDean	well I'll keep looking too, good luck with getting it working.
2010-05-06T03:34:00.000Z	DeathMetalDean	SealedWithAKiss	my brother updated his ubuntu 10.4 with 64bit and apparently his flash never broke, dunno what's wrong lol
2010-05-06T03:34:00.000Z	SealedWithAKiss	DeathMetalDean	flash has always been a problem for me.
2010-05-06T04:04:00.000Z	DeathMetalDean	SealedWithAKiss	haven't found any ways of getting flash yet, you had any luck?
2010-05-06T04:04:00.000Z	SealedWithAKiss	DeathMetalDean	I have been playing the PS3 so no I haven't.
2010-05-06T04:05:00.000Z	DeathMetalDean	SealedWithAKiss	 lol xD ok
2010-05-06T04:14:00.000Z	DeathMetalDean	SealedWithAKiss	you may call me a genius, I fixed the problem
2010-05-06T04:14:00.000Z	DeathMetalDean	SealedWithAKiss	lol xD go to Ubuntu Software Centre and search "flash" then just install the Adobe Flash Plugin
