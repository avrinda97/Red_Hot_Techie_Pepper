2009-12-10T10:11:00.000Z	gbear14275		is there a way to test connection speed when ssh'ed into a headless machine?
2009-12-10T10:12:00.000Z	greezmunkey	gbear14275	ifconfig, or bmon would work
2010-05-23T05:07:00.000Z	greezmunkey	gbear14275	ping something
2010-07-24T10:58:00.000Z	greezmunkey	gbear14275	Bug#549976 may look familiar: http://groups.google.com/group/linux.debian.bugs.dist/browse_thread/thread/6519602a67871f5f
2010-07-24T10:59:00.000Z	gbear14275	greezmunkey	found that... but didn't see/don't know how to find any follow up
2010-07-24T11:00:00.000Z	gbear14275	greezmunkey	but yes that looksalmost identical
2010-07-24T11:01:00.000Z	greezmunkey	gbear14275	agreed, I have had only limited sucess tracking down bugs. Most of the time everything runs fine, You can get a lot of wierd errors sometimes that simply don't amount to much.
2010-07-24T11:01:00.000Z	greezmunkey	gbear14275	not much help, I know...
2010-07-24T11:02:00.000Z	gbear14275	greezmunkey	thats ok :)  The conversation is at least welcome.  So I guess I'm asking now because it seems that every kernel upgrade I'm getting more and more of them
2010-07-24T11:02:00.000Z	greezmunkey	gbear14275	do you keep track of your logs, check them regularly?
2010-07-24T11:04:00.000Z	gbear14275	greezmunkey	not as well as I should...  it would be more accurate to say I just tend to watch the messages that normally occur during installs, startup, etc.  Watch for flag messages.  But to be honest... the logs are a bit intimidating and I don't understand them as much as I would like...  it's something I should get more involved in
2010-07-24T11:05:00.000Z	gbear14275	greezmunkey	so... my latest kernel upgrade generated these related snippets.  http://pastebin.com/xn2C6EKq
2010-07-24T11:05:00.000Z	greezmunkey	gbear14275	your linux system is more like an old school hot rod. It takes a bit of fussing and figuring, and if you know where to look it will tell you what is wrong. Checking logs is like poppin' the hood and tweaking the carbs, just something you need to do...
2010-07-24T11:05:00.000Z	gbear14275	greezmunkey	  those are just chunks I pulled out and copied down... but you can see the body of the message seems to stay the same but the PID tends to change and they grow and shrink in quantity throughout the upgrade process
2010-07-24T11:06:00.000Z	greezmunkey	gbear14275	I'll take a look, but no promises.
2010-07-24T11:07:00.000Z	gbear14275	greezmunkey	right now shes still running well, but i perk up when i hear pops and rattles ;).   No need to devote time to it... just passing examples
2010-07-24T11:09:00.000Z	greezmunkey	gbear14275	you keep you system regularly updated, right?
2010-07-24T11:10:00.000Z	gbear14275	greezmunkey	yeah...  longest between updates is normally no more than a couple weeks
2010-07-24T11:10:00.000Z	gbear14275	greezmunkey	normally 3 times a week
