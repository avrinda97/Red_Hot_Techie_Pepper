2005-12-07T15:31:00.000Z	ptlo	quitte	Breezy Badger (5.10)
2005-12-07T15:31:00.000Z	quitte	ptlo	thanks
2005-12-07T15:32:00.000Z	quitte	ptlo	uhm is that unstable?
2005-12-07T15:32:00.000Z	ptlo	quitte	no, that's stable and supported release
2005-12-07T15:33:00.000Z	quitte	ptlo	what is unstable?
2005-12-07T15:33:00.000Z	ptlo	quitte	current unstable version is called Dapper Drake
2005-12-07T15:33:00.000Z	quitte	ptlo	ok thanks a lot
2005-12-07T15:34:00.000Z	ptlo	quitte	np. btw dapper is highly unstable at this point and you shouldn't try it unless you're willing to devote much time & energy to development :) dapper (6.04) will be released in april 2006
2005-12-07T15:35:00.000Z	quitte	ptlo	i just want the xorg sources of it
2005-12-07T15:35:00.000Z	ptlo	quitte	why?
2005-12-07T15:35:00.000Z	ptlo		rumors go, x.org in dapper is currently pretty broken (or was a day or two ago)
2005-12-07T15:36:00.000Z	quitte	ptlo	i hope it is already fully modularized. im trying to port debian to sh3 and monolithic is too big to handle on such a slow system
2005-12-07T15:37:00.000Z	ptlo	quitte	x.org 7 should be fully modularized, use autotools and other good stuff, yeah
2005-12-07T15:38:00.000Z	quitte	ptlo	great. so dragon uses xorg7 finally?
2005-12-07T15:38:00.000Z	ptlo	quitte	yes
2005-12-07T15:39:00.000Z	ptlo	quitte	btw the community is still not decided if it's a duck or a dragon, and mark is keeping his mouth sealed :)
2005-12-07T15:41:00.000Z	quitte	ptlo	should be duck imho. dragon makes me think of kde
