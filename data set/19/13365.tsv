2005-10-18T09:40:00.000Z	erchache		hi again
2005-10-18T09:40:00.000Z	erchache		when try to install via apt-get show me that
2005-10-18T09:41:00.000Z	erchache		WARNING: The following packages cannot be authenticated!
2005-10-18T09:41:00.000Z	erchache		why?
2005-10-18T09:41:00.000Z	erchache		need to get other key for source.list?
2005-10-18T09:41:00.000Z	eyequeue	erchache	 man apt-key
2005-10-18T09:42:00.000Z	eyequeue	erchache	 and what other repositories are you using?
2005-10-18T09:43:00.000Z	eyequeue	erchache	 *.ubuntu.com should be covered by the first key
2005-10-18T09:44:00.000Z	eyequeue	erchache	always possible, but i don't suppose it's the problem in this case
2005-10-18T09:46:00.000Z	erchache	eyequeue	keys look good....but message appears....secure or not?
2005-10-18T09:47:00.000Z	eyequeue	erchache	 i'd listen to the message myself
2005-10-18T09:47:00.000Z	eyequeue	erchache	 let me double check here against my fingerprints, okay?
2005-10-18T09:50:00.000Z	eyequeue	erchache	 i suppose you could change es. to pt. or fr. mirrors?
2006-06-13T09:37:00.000Z	eyequeue	erchache	no, it is a differernt cd
2006-06-13T09:37:00.000Z	erchache	eyequeue	 explain this dapper server feature
2006-06-13T09:38:00.000Z	eyequeue	erchache	all ubuntu cds use the same repositories
2006-06-13T09:40:00.000Z	eyequeue	erchache	the new layout is designed to make things easier for those installing from just-cd, but wanting more server-oriented packages, not desktop-oriented packages
2006-06-13T09:41:00.000Z	erchache	eyequeue	on shipit....only says for desktop on dapper.....not server
2006-06-13T09:41:00.000Z	eyequeue	erchache	perhaps shipit is still geared toward desktop user?  i don't know
