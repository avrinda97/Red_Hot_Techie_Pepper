2010-06-26T10:40:00.000Z	phil_		My panels are missing as well as my desktop icons.
2010-06-26T10:42:00.000Z	phil_		That command restored my panels, but my desktop icons are still missing.
2010-06-26T10:42:00.000Z	bazhang	phil_	 using compiz or metacity
2010-06-26T10:43:00.000Z	phil_	bazhang	No
2010-06-26T10:43:00.000Z	bazhang	phil_	it was not a yes or no question
2010-06-26T10:44:00.000Z	bazhang	phil_	compiz or metacity (choose one)
2010-06-26T10:45:00.000Z	phil_	bazhang	Are you saying that you're certain I am running one of those?
2010-06-26T10:45:00.000Z	phil_	bazhang	Or that I ought to be?
2010-06-26T10:45:00.000Z	bazhang	phil_	do you wish to give more info, or should we guess
2010-06-26T10:45:00.000Z	phil_	bazhang	I don't know what you want me to tell you.
2010-06-26T10:45:00.000Z	phil_	bazhang	I came here for help.  If I knew what else to tell you, I would.
2010-06-26T10:46:00.000Z	bazhang	phil_	you are using gnome? lxde? xfce4? kde4?
2010-06-26T10:46:00.000Z	phil_	bazhang	I'm using Ubuntu 10.04.
2010-06-26T10:46:00.000Z	phil_	bazhang	It comes with gnome.
2010-06-26T10:46:00.000Z	bazhang	phil_	and you have compiz enabled?
2010-06-26T10:48:00.000Z	phil_	bazhang	I don't believe so.  I never explicitly installed it.  The only way I have it is if it came with the base install, or it was an automatic update.
2010-06-26T10:48:00.000Z	bazhang	phil_	try alt-f2  then type metacity --replace
2010-06-26T10:48:00.000Z	phil_	bazhang	So, compiz is installed by default?  Why would I type anything to do with metacity if you just told me I had either compiz or metacity.
2010-06-26T10:49:00.000Z	phil_	bazhang	I typed what you said and all my windows flash for a second, but that's it.  Nothing changes after that.
