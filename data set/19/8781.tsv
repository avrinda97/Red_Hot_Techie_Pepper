2007-09-29T12:02:00.000Z	Stephen	Orfeous	well the past times i burned a CD i didnt know to slow the burn speed down. and also I didnt know how to set it to burn ISO
2007-09-29T12:03:00.000Z	Orfeous	Stephen	you dont need to set the speed down.. just use a good cd quality or a DVD
2007-09-29T12:03:00.000Z	Stephen	Orfeous	but the one i have right now doesnt even boot. it notices theres a CD but wont boot
2007-09-29T12:04:00.000Z	Orfeous	Stephen	have you checked your bios settings?
2007-09-29T12:04:00.000Z	Stephen	Orfeous	i set them to check both cd drives before any hard drives
