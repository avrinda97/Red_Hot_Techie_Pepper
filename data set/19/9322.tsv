2007-02-02T15:35:00.000Z	jdhoreotg		ahh! something bad is going on with my Ubuntu install!
2007-02-02T15:36:00.000Z	jdhoreotg		i tried to get Beryl working with AIGLX, so i enabled it in AIGLX and installed Beryl and it didn't work for me (apparently Beryl is not a big fan of dual-monitor) so i removed the AIGLX lines out of my xorg.conf, removed beryl and rebooted and now, i can't see the titlebar of any of my applications...please help
2007-02-02T15:38:00.000Z	jdhoreotg		can someone help me???

2007-02-02T15:40:00.000Z	jdhoreotg		there's the story, zeifer
2007-02-02T15:40:00.000Z	ademan	jdhoreotg	try starting up the beryl manager again, and make sure you set metacity to your window manager (should be in that little tray icon)
2007-02-02T15:42:00.000Z	ademan	jdhoreotg	well really if metacity was working i'm pretty sure you'd have your window borders, though in the meantime alt+drag should be able to move windows
2007-02-02T15:42:00.000Z	ademan	jdhoreotg	if you can't alt+drag, metacity definitely isn't up
2007-02-02T15:44:00.000Z	ademan	jdhoreotg	hard to say, by the way, the beryl-manager isn't added to your session startups is it?
2007-02-02T15:45:00.000Z	jdhoreotg	ademan	nope
2007-02-02T15:46:00.000Z	ademan	jdhoreotg	so your lack of window borders was after a reboot? or just after turning off beryl?
2007-02-02T15:47:00.000Z	jdhoreotg	ademan	after a reboot after turning off and uninstalling beryl
2007-02-02T15:47:00.000Z	ademan	jdhoreotg	ah, well maybe you should double check that metacity is still in your session startup stuff
2007-02-02T15:48:00.000Z	ademan	jdhoreotg	yep
2007-02-02T15:48:00.000Z	ademan	jdhoreotg	yeah i don't have metacity in mine either, so i guess i was wrong
2007-02-02T15:49:00.000Z	ademan	jdhoreotg	i suppose you might consider restarting just to see if its actually a problem or not
2007-02-02T15:49:00.000Z	jdhoreotg	ademan	i'm thinking of reinstalling Ubuntu anyway, do you think i should go with Fiesty or stick with Edgy?
2007-02-02T15:50:00.000Z	ademan	jdhoreotg	well i definitely wouldn't install fiesty in its current state, but if you're considering waiting for fiesty release, that doesn't sound like a bad plan
