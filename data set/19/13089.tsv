2005-11-20T12:38:00.000Z	dmoyne		hello ; with 64 bits Breezy where to get dosemu I mean with which repositry ; thanks
2005-11-20T12:40:00.000Z	nalioth	dmoyne	read above re dosemu
2005-11-20T12:42:00.000Z	nalioth	dmoyne	it's in multiverse
2005-11-20T12:43:00.000Z	nalioth	dmoyne	open a console, and type "sudo apt-get build-dep dosemu"
2005-11-20T12:43:00.000Z	nalioth	dmoyne	then type "sudo apt-get -b source dosemu"
2005-11-20T12:43:00.000Z	nalioth	dmoyne	after that is done, you'll find a dosemu deb in your current directory
2005-11-20T13:03:00.000Z	nalioth	dmoyne	open your sources.list and enable source repos
2005-11-20T13:04:00.000Z	nalioth	dmoyne	however you wish to accomplish it
2005-11-20T13:14:00.000Z	nalioth	dmoyne	yes, now update your apt-get (reload in synaptic)
2005-11-20T13:16:00.000Z	nalioth	dmoyne	amd64 is not very user friendly when it comes to commercial or patented software
2005-11-20T13:16:00.000Z	nalioth	dmoyne	in your console, type "sudo apt-get build-dep dosemu"
2005-11-20T13:17:00.000Z	nalioth	dmoyne	qemu is a OS emulator
2005-11-20T13:19:00.000Z	nalioth	dmoyne	in your terminal, type "sudo apt-get -b source dosemu"
2005-11-20T13:20:00.000Z	nalioth	dmoyne	then you have your repositories incorrect, for i just did what i'm asking you to do and dosemu came down just fine
2005-11-20T13:21:00.000Z	nalioth	dmoyne	it does not matter what distro you are using, the source will build on any platform. i am on a powermac
2005-11-20T13:27:00.000Z	dmoyne	nalioth	: can you mail me your "sources.list" in order for me to check what is wrong with mine (I do not think I can receive with Kopete but try first if not working dmoyne@tiscali.fr) ; thanks
2005-11-20T13:33:00.000Z	dmoyne	nalioth	: same problem with the example you have just supplied after installing this sources.list I still cannot see dosemu proposed I think I know the reason it may be in hoary then when you update in breezy you see it but it is a hoary package !!!!
2005-11-20T13:33:00.000Z	nalioth	dmoyne	watch ubotu
2005-11-20T13:34:00.000Z	nalioth	dmoyne	it is in both hoary and breezy.
