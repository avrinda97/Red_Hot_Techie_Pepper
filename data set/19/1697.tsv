2011-01-25T22:59:00.000Z	BajK_		How can I change the background of a tty console? On my developer kubuntu in virtualbox, the consoles are blue like the plymouth screen but how do I accomplish this on a normal installation?
2011-01-25T23:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	BajK_	 thats a framebuffer feature I belive.
2011-01-25T23:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	BajK_	 i find using the framebuffer in the console. slows down the conosole greatly
2011-01-25T23:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	BajK_	 it can also LAG...
2011-02-13T16:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	BajK_	 why shouldent it?
2011-02-13T16:32:00.000Z	BajK_	Dr_Willis	because it doesnt make sense?
2011-02-13T16:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	BajK_	 it makes perfect sence..  C and c are different letters and different asci codes.. how about in languages other then english?
2011-02-13T16:32:00.000Z	BajK_	Dr_Willis	it does not make any sense
2011-02-13T16:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	BajK_	 yes it does.
2011-02-13T16:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	BajK_	 lower case everything then you wont have an issue.
2011-02-13T16:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	BajK_	 ive seen this argued in the foums.. and theres more to it then 'Foo'  vs 'foo'
2011-02-13T16:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	BajK_	 ntfs and vfat..
2011-02-13T16:35:00.000Z	BajK_	Dr_Willis	any more advanced fs?
2011-02-13T16:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	BajK_	 you are saying NTFS is not advanced?
2011-02-13T16:35:00.000Z	BajK_	Dr_Willis	it isn'T
2011-02-13T16:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	BajK_	  tell her proper spelling and case matter.
2011-02-13T16:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	BajK_	 its not an excuse.. its a reason.
2011-02-13T16:36:00.000Z	BajK_	Dr_Willis	and why she can have 10 files of same name
2011-02-13T16:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	BajK_	 you could write an app tp do that.. but at the 'filesystem' level. case matters.
