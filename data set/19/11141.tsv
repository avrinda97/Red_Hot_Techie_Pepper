2006-04-25T07:12:00.000Z	vincenz		How do I allow a user to run background processes even after he logs out??
2006-04-25T07:13:00.000Z	martyv	vincenz	use "screen"
2006-04-25T07:13:00.000Z	vincenz	martyv	without screen
2006-04-25T07:13:00.000Z	vincenz	martyv	it's a background process
2006-04-25T07:13:00.000Z	martyv	vincenz	nohup
2006-04-25T07:13:00.000Z	vincenz		nohup?
2006-04-25T07:13:00.000Z	vincenz	martyv	thank you
2006-04-25T07:14:00.000Z	martyv	vincenz	no hang up - old school before screen
2006-04-25T07:14:00.000Z	vincenz	martyv	how come my other user doesn't need this
2006-04-25T07:14:00.000Z	vincenz	martyv	my primary user
2006-04-25T07:14:00.000Z	martyv	vincenz	how do you mean
2006-04-25T07:14:00.000Z	vincenz	martyv	well if I log in as vincenz onto my desktop and run the lambdabot &, it's fine
2006-04-25T07:14:00.000Z	vincenz	martyv	but with the new user "icfp" I need to do 'nohup ./lambdabot &'
2006-04-25T07:15:00.000Z	vincenz	martyv	it's still killing it
2006-04-25T07:15:00.000Z	vincenz	martyv	does the user need special perms?
2006-04-25T07:16:00.000Z	martyv	vincenz	i would have thought if you run any process in a X terminal and then logout the process will be killed, unless you spawn it as a daemon
2006-04-25T07:19:00.000Z	vincenz		grr
2006-04-25T07:19:00.000Z	vincenz		nohup ain't working
2006-04-25T07:21:00.000Z	martyv	vincenz	what does lambdadot do ?
