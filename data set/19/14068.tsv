2006-10-29T06:02:00.000Z	crimsun	Kleggas	I've already committed fixes for the realtek issues; they should be in an upcoming errata kernel (no ETA).
2006-10-29T06:03:00.000Z	Kleggas	crimsun	so I will be able to have both mic/front AND fglrx? It will not default back to OSS drivers as soon as fglrx is present on the system?
2006-10-29T06:03:00.000Z	crimsun	Kleggas	I can't speak for your particular issue, as I can't test against fglrx
2006-10-29T06:04:00.000Z	Kleggas	crimsun	ok. will have to test when it is out
