2007-02-04T11:24:00.000Z	bulmer		shouldn't the Alternate install cd should fit in a 650MB cdrom disk? its like 696.5MB ?
2007-02-04T11:25:00.000Z	unop	bulmer	 650MB disks tend to allow for a little extra .. so that might fit but just about
2007-02-04T11:26:00.000Z	bulmer	unop	i guess not..i have a cd-rw
2007-02-04T11:27:00.000Z	unop	bulmer	 i'm guessing you have tried to fit it on then -- you probably need a 700MiB disk then
2007-02-04T11:29:00.000Z	bulmer	unop	yes i tried burning em, didnt noticed the size until it got ejected.  and I didnt know there are cdroms that are over 650MB, i thought 650MB is max
2007-02-04T11:30:00.000Z	unop	bulmer	the standard capacities for CD-Roms are 650MiB and 700MiB .. there are other non-standard ones which accomodate more or less
2007-02-04T11:31:00.000Z	bulmer	unop	thanks for the info
2007-02-12T09:22:00.000Z	unop	bulmer	 but, isnt runlevel2 the default on ubuntu?
2007-02-12T09:22:00.000Z	bulmer	unop	i think 2-5 level is default, so going to level 1 might make a difference and then back
2007-02-12T09:23:00.000Z	unop	bulmer	 errm, i'm quite certain that there are differences in runlevels 2-5 .. it's better to go to runlevel2 after 1
2007-02-13T08:17:00.000Z	unop	bulmer	 are you sure it's not CIFS (like samba) thats not sharing the printer there?
2007-02-13T08:18:00.000Z	bulmer	unop	the LPD services is run on the xp
2007-02-13T08:18:00.000Z	bulmer	unop	i just need to telnet to it or something to check the queue if it is getting the print jobs
2007-02-13T08:19:00.000Z	unop	bulmer	 if you were to be strict .. LPD is a unix thing not windows .. so if you said LPD on windows, i'd be inclined to think you were running it under cygwin/uwin
2007-02-13T08:20:00.000Z	bulmer	unop	they have an equivalent LPD services running on the windows xp
2007-02-13T08:21:00.000Z	unop	bulmer	 well, i think you mean "Windows File and Printing Services"  .. so http://www.faqs.org/docs/Linux-mini/Debian-and-Windows-Shared-Printing.html
2007-02-13T08:21:00.000Z	bulmer	unop	actually I dont know how to test if one is running (LPD) on an Linux box..just do an lpstat?
2007-02-13T08:21:00.000Z	bulmer	unop	that could be it, File and print services
2007-02-13T08:22:00.000Z	unop	bulmer	 err yea, that link has a section i think to troubleshooting the windows print services
