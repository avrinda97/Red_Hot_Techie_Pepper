2009-01-24T04:07:00.000Z	n8tuser2		vax_-> dont know if there are settings you can enable in alsamixer
2009-01-24T04:08:00.000Z	aldipc	n8tuser2	usually portrequests which arrive at my dsl router are blocked by my dsl router already and don't even arrive at my box which is connected with NAT on 192.168.174.24, unless of course the connection was initiated from my box or when I have port forwarding activated.. well I have no port forwarding activated and still these packets arrive at my 192.168.174.24 box, I don't undsrtand why
2009-01-24T04:11:00.000Z	aldipc	n8tuser2	no, because if it were initiated from my box Firestarter would not block it..
2009-01-24T04:13:00.000Z	aldipc	n8tuser2	ok
2009-01-24T04:26:00.000Z	n8tuser2	aldipc	-> dont know, im not privy to your iptables rules, would you care to post them?
2009-01-24T04:28:00.000Z	aldipc	n8tuser2	I just use the basic ubuntu box and have only added a couple of emule ports and 2 in the 50000 range for another bittorrent client I once used.. that's it
2009-01-24T04:29:00.000Z	n8tuser2	aldipc	-> nope its not obvious, and your statements are not adequate to see what the rules are, either you post them or we'll be guessing all day
2009-01-24T04:29:00.000Z	aldipc	n8tuser2	okay.. how do I see my rules?
2009-01-24T04:30:00.000Z	n8tuser2	aldipc	-> sudo iptables -vL
2009-01-24T04:32:00.000Z	aldipc	n8tuser2	it says iptables v1.3.8
2009-01-24T04:32:00.000Z	n8tuser2	aldipc	-> post in pastebin
2009-01-24T04:32:00.000Z	aldipc	n8tuser2	it only gave me the version number
2009-01-24T04:34:00.000Z	aldipc	n8tuser2	it only gave me the version number, how do I list my iptables rules?

2009-01-24T04:39:00.000Z	n8tuser2	aldipc	-> sudo iptables -vL

2009-01-24T04:43:00.000Z	n8tuser2	aldipc	-> you have bunch of complex rules, so I would expect what you observed, block ports
2009-01-24T04:44:00.000Z	aldipc	n8tuser2	that is what I already know, I just want to know how these packets arrive at my box from behind a NAT router
