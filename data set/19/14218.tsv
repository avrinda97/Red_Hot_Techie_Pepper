2005-10-27T12:24:00.000Z	D1		can you mount your ipod as an external HD?
2005-10-27T12:24:00.000Z	Lathiat	D1	yes
2005-10-27T12:24:00.000Z	Lathiat	D1	no
2005-10-27T12:24:00.000Z	Lathiat	D1	you will need to use an ipod tool to put the songs in
2005-10-27T12:24:00.000Z	Lathiat	D1	ipod has a special database of music
2005-10-27T12:24:00.000Z	Lathiat	D1	if its not updated, it wont see the songs
2005-10-27T12:25:00.000Z	Lathiat	D1	try 'gtkpod'
2005-10-27T12:25:00.000Z	Lathiat	D1	'banshee' also supports ipod
2005-10-27T12:25:00.000Z	Lathiat	D1	banshee might be better actually
