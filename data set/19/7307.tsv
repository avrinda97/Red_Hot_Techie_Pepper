2007-10-25T11:30:00.000Z	gogeta	zetheroo	i think you gotta install the compiz-settings-manager
2007-10-25T11:31:00.000Z	zetheroo	gogeta	yeah I have it ... but where in there... ha
2007-11-02T15:04:00.000Z	gogeta	zetheroo	for well off topic
2007-11-02T15:04:00.000Z	gogeta	zetheroo	this channel is used for support mostly
2007-12-16T10:36:00.000Z	gogeta	zetheroo	i said that like 50 times to them
2007-12-16T10:36:00.000Z	zetheroo	gogeta	ha.. I bet you have
2007-12-16T10:36:00.000Z	gogeta	zetheroo	aka power cycling
2007-12-16T10:37:00.000Z	zetheroo	gogeta	no.. we are looking in to performing a hard reset and then enabling DHCP
2007-12-16T10:38:00.000Z	gogeta	zetheroo	lol what you think a powr cycle does lol it hard resets the modem
2007-12-16T10:38:00.000Z	gogeta	zetheroo	does on mine
2007-12-16T10:39:00.000Z	zetheroo	gogeta	ummm... hard reset actually takes place when you press a reset button on the device for a period of 4-10 seconds
2007-12-16T10:39:00.000Z	zetheroo	gogeta	its more than just unplugging the device
2007-12-16T10:40:00.000Z	zetheroo	gogeta	no any device reset.... if yours resets when you unpower it then you have a defect item or a really old one
2007-12-16T10:40:00.000Z	zetheroo	gogeta	yeah ok... I had one of those a few years back
2007-12-16T10:47:00.000Z	zetheroo	gogeta	true true
2007-12-16T10:56:00.000Z	zetheroo	gogeta	true we should really not be discussing windows here... my bad
