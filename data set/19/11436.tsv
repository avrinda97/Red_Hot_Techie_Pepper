2006-01-21T15:34:00.000Z	AndrewLee		I just upgraded to dapper kernel(2.6.15-12-powerpc), I have problem on using bcm43xx module on ibook.
2006-01-21T15:34:00.000Z	AndrewLee		Seems it can't load the firmware correctly..
2006-01-21T15:35:00.000Z	AndrewLee		I did fwcutter and put *.fw files into /lib/firmware
2006-01-21T15:35:00.000Z	AndrewLee		but after ifconfig eth1 up, the dmesg told me: bcm43xx: Error: Microcode "bcm43xx_microcode5.fw" not available to load failed.
2006-01-21T15:35:00.000Z	robotgeek	AndrewLee	did you extract them correctly? the forums page on that has pretty detailed explanation
2006-01-21T15:36:00.000Z	AndrewLee	robotgeek	I think I did, I got an old version of ap driver from osx 10.3
2006-01-21T15:37:00.000Z	AndrewLee	robotgeek	I got no error with fwcutter.
2006-01-21T15:37:00.000Z	robotgeek	AndrewLee	i got the firmware from someguy who linked to it, but it worked the first time for me
2006-01-21T15:38:00.000Z	AndrewLee	robotgeek	Only the first time?
2006-01-21T15:38:00.000Z	robotgeek	AndrewLee	i mean right on the first attempt
2006-01-21T15:39:00.000Z	AndrewLee	robotgeek	Maybe I should try the linked firmware too, where is the link?
2006-01-21T15:40:00.000Z	robotgeek	AndrewLee	it's somewhere on the thread, just search that thread for link
2006-01-21T15:42:00.000Z	AndrewLee	robotgeek	BTW, didn't you get error when using fwcutter with the linked driver?
2006-01-21T15:43:00.000Z	robotgeek	AndrewLee	i think that's the firmware itself
2006-01-21T15:44:00.000Z	AndrewLee	robotgeek	Did you compile ieee80211softmac.ko yourself?
2006-01-21T15:46:00.000Z	robotgeek	AndrewLee	no, lemme pull up what i did
2006-01-21T15:51:00.000Z	robotgeek	AndrewLee	PM
2006-01-21T15:51:00.000Z	AndrewLee	robotgeek	thanks
2006-01-21T15:52:00.000Z	robotgeek	AndrewLee	http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=561220&postcount=37 ignore the softmac or whatever
