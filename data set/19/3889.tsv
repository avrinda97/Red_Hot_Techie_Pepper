2010-04-10T10:38:00.000Z	Baram	greezmunkey	yeah, the WD 2TB caviar green, 63days after I bought it
2010-04-10T10:38:00.000Z	Curly_Q		Also the BIOS settings or compatibility.
2010-04-10T10:39:00.000Z	Baram		yeah, I should have thought of a temporary increase in RAM... oh well, it's basically done now
2010-04-10T10:39:00.000Z	Baram		my samsung spinpoint F1's have been running non-stop for almost a year and still in perfect condition, I'm sticking with samsung from now on :P
2010-04-10T10:40:00.000Z	Curly_Q		Greezmonkey I have a 1.5 TB HD and it works just fine with Windows but it hangs and crashes with a Windows Search engine. That is stupid but I know why, it is the buffer overflow.
2010-04-10T10:40:00.000Z	Baram		I haven't had issues with samsung discs, and since I live in Korea I can get excellent service if I do have a problem
2010-04-10T10:40:00.000Z	Curly_Q	Baram	try increasing your SWAP file or memory.
2010-04-10T10:41:00.000Z	Baram		curly_q it's done now, or done enough that I could recover 90% of what was lost since the last backup, just had to reinstall the OS since some of the system files got corrupted
2010-04-10T10:41:00.000Z	Curly_Q		With Windows it is called:   "Contiguous Memory" which is the same as SWAP.
2010-04-10T10:43:00.000Z	Baram	greezmunkey	yup, that was it, forgot to put in ia32-libs
2010-04-10T10:43:00.000Z	Curly_Q	Baram	please listen to me. You do not have to re-install any OS at all. All you need to do is replace the IMAGE component of the disk. That is quick and simple.
2010-04-10T10:44:00.000Z	Baram		curly_q good to know, but I already did it :P
2010-04-10T10:45:00.000Z	Curly_Q	Baram	if you did it then you would not be asking questions here. Sorry to say that.
2010-04-10T10:46:00.000Z	Curly_Q	Baram	I work as a Scientist collecting not only data but also saving hard drives that fail and recouping the data on them.
2010-04-10T10:47:00.000Z	Baram		curly_q wish you were around a few days ago when it died, was a learning process for me :P
2010-04-10T10:47:00.000Z	Curly_Q		Data is Data. It is a magnetic media issue and not a Linux or Unix or Windows issue. It is a material hard drive issue.
2010-04-10T10:48:00.000Z	Curly_Q	Baram	I can recover your data from your hard drive.
