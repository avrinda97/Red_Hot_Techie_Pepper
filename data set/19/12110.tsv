2005-11-10T11:21:00.000Z	mustard5	Arafangion	k
2005-11-10T11:21:00.000Z	mustard5	Arafangion	I think his problem is how do I uninstall
2005-11-10T11:22:00.000Z	mustard5	Arafangion	how to uninstall ubuntu
2005-11-10T17:28:00.000Z	mustard5	Arafangion	I'm going to try a guess.... :)  resolve.conf?
2005-11-10T17:28:00.000Z	mustard5	Arafangion	I've never set up wifi in my life though :)
2005-11-10T17:46:00.000Z	mustard5	Arafangion	ah ok..thank for that info
2005-11-10T17:47:00.000Z	Arafangion	mustard5	What info?
2005-11-10T17:47:00.000Z	mustard5	Arafangion	the /etc/resolve.conf not being the one you need
2005-11-10T17:47:00.000Z	Arafangion	mustard5	Indeed.
2005-11-10T17:52:00.000Z	Arafangion	mustard5	No, that's why I asked :)
2005-11-10T17:53:00.000Z	mustard5	Arafangion	yeah..I was hoping Mabus would have it fresh in his memory, but no luck
2006-02-27T07:27:00.000Z	Arafangion	mustard5	menu.lst is irrelevant here.
2006-02-27T07:37:00.000Z	mustard5	Arafangion	since its a new install, could he just try a reinstall again?
2006-02-27T07:38:00.000Z	Arafangion	mustard5	My take is generally that if he just installed, it broke, a reinstall will generally result in the same situation.

2006-02-27T07:39:00.000Z	Arafangion	mustard5	I do find it very unusual that he can't access the grub shell.
2006-02-27T07:40:00.000Z	Arafangion	mustard5	I could blow my linux altogether, and still be able to access my grub shell.
