2009-11-22T02:32:00.000Z	mynameguy		what do u mean?......If I use ubuntu again it will get hot?
2009-11-22T02:33:00.000Z	whammo	mynameguy	when you installed did you shoose any options like ACPI off or NOLAPIC?
2009-11-22T02:34:00.000Z	whammo	mynameguy	good
2009-11-22T02:34:00.000Z	whammo	mynameguy	if you're SURE it's running hotter then it should, maybe some power management feature it's working right
2009-11-22T02:35:00.000Z	whammo	mynameguy	BUT that's not necessarily a problem exactly
2009-11-22T02:35:00.000Z	whammo	mynameguy	do you think you are suffering any heat-related performance issues or anything?
2009-11-22T02:35:00.000Z	whammo	mynameguy	because my gues is it's probably fine
2009-11-22T02:36:00.000Z	mynameguy	whammo	I think my CPU is slower now
2009-11-22T02:36:00.000Z	whammo	mynameguy	do you know if your lappy uses speedstep or anything like that that?
2009-11-22T02:38:00.000Z	whammo	mynameguy	OK many laptops have a CPU scaling feature to conserve battery under lighter cpu loads. sometime a default install neglects that feature and the CPU runs in one mode all the time
2009-11-22T02:38:00.000Z	mynameguy	whammo	how to find that?
2009-11-22T02:39:00.000Z	whammo	mynameguy	you have a little googling to do to get to know your system better. look up the model of your laptop along with CPU scaling or speedstep and linux
2009-11-22T02:40:00.000Z	whammo	mynameguy	but I would advise you to not even bother unless it seems like a real problem
2009-11-22T02:40:00.000Z	mynameguy	whammo	ok
