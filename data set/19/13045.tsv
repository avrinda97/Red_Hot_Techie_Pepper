2006-03-02T06:30:00.000Z	Madpilot	Poodlecake	use sudo
2006-03-02T06:33:00.000Z	Madpilot	Poodlecake	because you typed it out wrong
2006-03-02T06:33:00.000Z	Madpilot	Poodlecake	you don't want to use chmod like that on root's folders
2006-03-02T06:38:00.000Z	Madpilot	Poodlecake	what format is the stuff you're trying to install in?
2006-03-02T06:40:00.000Z	Madpilot	Poodlecake	no, because root owns /opt and the rest - you don't
2006-03-02T06:43:00.000Z	Madpilot	Poodlecake	what jetscreamer just said
2006-03-02T06:45:00.000Z	Madpilot	Poodlecake	sure there is - try "gksudo gedit"
2006-03-02T06:45:00.000Z	Madpilot	Poodlecake	add the name of the doc after 'gedit'
2006-03-02T06:46:00.000Z	Madpilot	Poodlecake	are you running Kubuntu?
