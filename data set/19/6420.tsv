2008-01-29T19:57:00.000Z	bkar		Shinobi-> is it really a valid xp iso you have put in cd/dvd rom? if you have the physical xp on cdrom , virtual box can access it too
2008-01-29T19:58:00.000Z	bkar		Shinobi-> you tried what? be specific
2008-01-29T20:00:00.000Z	bkar		Shinobi-> again, Im asking you, is the burnt cd image really a valid iso you can boot from?  try to boot from it directly as if you were about to install it..and see if your system boots from it
2008-01-29T20:00:00.000Z	bkar		Shinobi-> thats the point I am making, your copied iso of xp is invalid..you can not even boot from it directly
2008-01-29T20:01:00.000Z	bkar		Shinobi-> get yourself a valid xp iso,
2008-01-29T20:02:00.000Z	bkar		Shinobi-> you have to make sure its a valid bootable image, getting it from jsut anybody ..you are taking chances
2008-01-29T20:03:00.000Z	bkar		Yonie-> easy.. route add default gateway xx.x..x.x
2008-01-29T20:04:00.000Z	bkar		Shinobi-> k3b only burns, it doesnt tell you its a valid bootable iso
2008-01-29T20:05:00.000Z	Yonie	bkar	is it route add default gateway and the gateways ip?
2008-01-29T20:05:00.000Z	Yonie	bkar	thanks
2008-01-29T20:20:00.000Z	Yonie	bkar	its quite complicated the whole story, but for now i want to have 2 internet connections, and my dsl must have the default gateway and i want to route the other connections
2008-01-29T20:23:00.000Z	Yonie	bkar	i have a 384k line, so my max speed to download is like 40kb/s but im limited to 2 gigs a month
2008-01-29T20:25:00.000Z	bkar	Yonie	just for comparison, here in california, we pay about 30 dollars a month for 1Mbps down/150kbps up dsl
2008-01-29T20:26:00.000Z	Yonie	bkar	:( thats so awesome!! here i pay about the same for my connection if i convert from Rands to dollars
2008-01-29T20:27:00.000Z	Yonie	bkar	so when i connect my adsl, is there no way i can find my default gateway?
2008-01-29T20:28:00.000Z	Yonie	bkar	here our dsl ip changes everytime we connect
2008-01-29T20:29:00.000Z	Yonie	bkar	thanks
2008-01-29T20:30:00.000Z	Yonie	bkar	can i paste what i get when i type route -n in prvt ?
2008-01-29T20:31:00.000Z	bkar	Yonie	paste it in pastebin
