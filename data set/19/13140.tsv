2005-05-19T11:56:00.000Z	eob84		is he
2005-05-19T11:56:00.000Z	eob84		yea
2005-05-19T11:57:00.000Z	eob84		what is the syntax to force a program to install
2005-05-19T11:58:00.000Z	eob84		I tried dpkg -i --force
2005-05-19T11:58:00.000Z	eob84		if it isn't the apt database
2005-05-19T11:58:00.000Z	eob84		I can't seem to install it if it needs dep.
2005-05-19T11:59:00.000Z	eob84		as secure as all unix distros
2005-05-19T11:59:00.000Z	eob84		the more apps you have the more you compromise your security
2005-05-19T12:00:00.000Z	eob84		you can upgrade using apt
2005-05-19T12:00:00.000Z	eob84		you can put it in a group
2005-05-19T12:00:00.000Z	HappyFool	eob84	i'm not a dpkg guru, but what happens if you do 'dpkg -i <deb1> <deb2>' ?
2005-05-19T12:01:00.000Z	HappyFool	eob84	otherwise take a look at 'dpkg --force-help'  -- i think dpkg --force-all might be the hammer you're looking for
2005-05-19T12:01:00.000Z	eob84	HappyFool	that worked perfect
2005-05-19T12:01:00.000Z	HappyFool		which, the first?
2005-05-19T12:01:00.000Z	eob84	HappyFool	I have no clue why I didn't think of it
2005-05-19T12:02:00.000Z	eob84	HappyFool	yea
2005-05-19T12:02:00.000Z	HappyFool		cool :-)
2005-05-19T12:02:00.000Z	eob84	HappyFool	thanx I was actually working a while on this
2005-05-19T12:02:00.000Z	eob84	HappyFool	the solution is sooo lame...
