2007-03-18T13:22:00.000Z	Flannel	kosnick	you don't need to sudo su, just sudo.
2007-03-18T13:33:00.000Z	Flannel	kosnick	and, is this edgy or dapper?
2007-03-18T13:23:00.000Z	Flannel	kosnick	no.
2007-03-18T13:23:00.000Z	Flannel	kosnick	sudo icecast
2007-03-18T13:23:00.000Z	Flannel	kosnick	but, you shouldn't need to sudo icecast anyway.
2007-03-18T13:25:00.000Z	Flannel	kosnick	`sudo /etc/init.d/icecast2 restart` will restart your icecast server
2007-03-18T13:25:00.000Z	Flannel	kosnick	you don't need to use sudo to change to that directory, just cd to it
2007-03-18T13:26:00.000Z	Flannel	kosnick	what?
2007-03-18T13:27:00.000Z	Flannel	kosnick	`cd /etc/icecast2` gives you what?
2007-03-18T13:27:00.000Z	Flannel	kosnick	that's correct.  Restarting your computer will restart icecast.
2007-03-18T13:28:00.000Z	Flannel	kosnick	eh?  That shouldn't be.
2007-03-18T13:28:00.000Z	Flannel	kosnick	did you fiddle with the permissions?
2007-03-18T13:29:00.000Z	Flannel	kosnick	what are the perms on that folder?  (cd /etc, then ls -al | grep icecast)
2007-03-18T13:31:00.000Z	Flannel	kosnick	no no.  `ls -al | grep icecast`
2007-03-18T13:32:00.000Z	Flannel	kosnick	no, not all of them.  Just the icecast line, that's what the grep is for
2007-03-18T13:33:00.000Z	Flannel	kosnick	what user:group?
2007-03-18T13:34:00.000Z	Flannel	kosnick	I suggest removing icecast2 package (with --purge) and then reinstalling it.
2007-03-18T13:36:00.000Z	Flannel	kosnick	very odd.  Well, alright.  We'll assume this is correct then.  Ok.  So, since I imagine you don't want to use sudo a couple of times, go ahead and `sudo -i` to get a root shell, then you can navigate to /etc/icecast2 and fiddle with the config stuff.  Once you're done, make sure you exit out of the root shell
2007-06-16T13:05:00.000Z	Flannel	kosnick	no.  That's not an "upgrade", thatll require a reinstall.  Of course, you can save your home partitions
