2006-01-14T08:24:00.000Z	dooglus	GameOver	you want your wireless card to work for all users don't you?
2006-01-14T08:24:00.000Z	dooglus	GameOver	stick the line you need to run at the end of /etc/init.d/bootmisc.sh
2006-01-14T08:25:00.000Z	dooglus	GameOver	then it will run when you boot
2006-01-14T08:26:00.000Z	dooglus	GameOver	you'll need to use "sudo" to edit it.  in kate, or whatever else
2006-01-14T08:27:00.000Z	dooglus	GameOver	I would "sudo kate /etc/init.d/bootmisc.sh"
2006-01-14T08:31:00.000Z	dooglus	GameOver	yes?
2006-01-14T08:31:00.000Z	dooglus	GameOver	I don't use kate.  It's all a bit too KDE for my tastes.  Do you have gedit?
2006-01-14T08:31:00.000Z	dooglus	GameOver	if so, try "sudo gedit /etc/init.d/bootmisc.sh"
2006-01-14T08:33:00.000Z	dooglus	GameOver	do you know 'vi' or 'nano'?  they can both edit it
2006-01-18T10:06:00.000Z	dooglus	GameOver	irssi is good
