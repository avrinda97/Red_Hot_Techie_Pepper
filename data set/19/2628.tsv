2010-05-05T17:44:00.000Z	marienz	Stormcr0w	I haven't been following along, but if you're thinking of hd testing make sure you've tried running a smart selftest
2010-05-05T17:45:00.000Z	Stormcr0w	marienz	from within Lucid?
2010-05-05T17:45:00.000Z	marienz	Stormcr0w	for example.
2010-05-05T17:45:00.000Z	marienz	Stormcr0w	or off a livecd. "smartctl -t long" iirc (but check the manpage) and there are gui tools as well.
2010-05-05T17:45:00.000Z	marienz	Stormcr0w	the vast majority of drives support smart, and it usually does a pretty good job of testing (comparable to running drive-specific tools)
2010-05-05T17:46:00.000Z	Stormcr0w	marienz	I've found smartmontools on Synaptic
2010-05-05T17:46:00.000Z	Stormcr0w	marienz	Which contain smartctl
2010-05-05T17:47:00.000Z	marienz	Stormcr0w	yes
2010-05-05T17:51:00.000Z	Stormcr0w	marienz	I am afraid these tools will not apply to me as the drive is an external USB (enclosure SATA)
2010-05-05T17:52:00.000Z	Stormcr0w	marienz	If it had been internal, SMART would work, but as an external, it throws an error message about its not being supported
2010-05-05T17:52:00.000Z	marienz	Stormcr0w	ahh. Very recent versions of smartctl have some support for smart through usb, but it may not support the one you have.
2010-05-05T17:52:00.000Z	marienz	Stormcr0w	apologies, I had missed that bit of information.
2010-05-05T17:52:00.000Z	Stormcr0w	marienz	No worries.
2010-05-05T18:24:00.000Z	Stormcr0w	marienz	Sorry to bother again. I believe that the problem with the boot latency I am having could also be related to the type of my motherboard. I have just found out that 10.04 does not auto-mount my DVD-RWs which are both PATA (IDE) on the same bus
2010-05-05T18:24:00.000Z	marienz	Stormcr0w	where did you say the latency was again? can you see it in dmesg?
2010-05-05T18:25:00.000Z	marienz	Stormcr0w	I haven't really been following along, just wanted to mention smartctl when drive checking came up
2010-05-05T18:25:00.000Z	Stormcr0w	marienz	Not really. It comes before that. However, in dmesg you can see a couple of cannot probe smb1 errors
2010-05-05T18:25:00.000Z	Stormcr0w	marienz	Sorry. I was wondering, is there a way to locate the DVD-RW's UUIDs?
2010-05-05T18:26:00.000Z	marienz	Stormcr0w	I have no idea, sorry.
