2010-02-28T15:35:00.000Z	knoppies	abhi_nav	One method of doing what you want to do (not sure if its the best method) is to use an encrypted VPN, but I think ssh might be what your looking for.
2010-02-28T15:36:00.000Z	knoppies	abhi_nav	some of the better routers have VPN settings in them, but as llutz said, you probably want to install it on your PC, not your router.
2010-02-28T15:38:00.000Z	abhi_nav	knoppies	actually I have instaled tor but I dont use it because it slows my speed
2010-02-28T15:38:00.000Z	abhi_nav	knoppies	Dr_Willis: llutz: is there any free encrypted vpn service? I am student.
2010-02-28T15:40:00.000Z	abhi_nav	knoppies	Dr_Willis: llutz: does vn slows down my speed as that of tor does?
2010-02-28T15:40:00.000Z	knoppies	abhi_nav	it depends what kind of VPN you use, in theory yes, will it be noticeable? depends on which vpn you use.
2010-02-28T15:41:00.000Z	abhi_nav	knoppies	hmm
2010-02-28T15:42:00.000Z	knoppies	abhi_nav	my brother uses a free VPN service so that hey gets a US 'external IP' for some websites, I think its called hotspot, but I dont use it myself so Im not sure.
2010-02-28T15:42:00.000Z	knoppies	abhi_nav	as its an open/free/anybody can use it VPN, expect it to be slow.
2010-02-28T15:42:00.000Z	abhi_nav	knoppies	Dr_Willis: llutz: why I am being paranoid is within last 2 moth my pc was 2 times automatically suddenly shuted down and for 3-4 times automatically logged out. Other reason is that i want to access that 'special sites'
2010-02-28T15:43:00.000Z	knoppies	abhi_nav	autoshutdown? sounds more like a trojan than your ISP, some random restarts could be caused by an underpowered PSU.
2010-02-28T15:44:00.000Z	abhi_nav	knoppies	yah its auto shut down. suddenlly happens
2010-02-28T15:45:00.000Z	knoppies	abhi_nav	clean out the dust from your case. try invest in a new case/fans.
2010-02-28T15:45:00.000Z	abhi_nav	knoppies	yah thinking for it now
2010-02-28T15:46:00.000Z	knoppies	abhi_nav	my machine restarts on overheating, rather than shutting down. Same would apply for an underpowered PSU.
2010-02-28T15:47:00.000Z	knoppies	abhi_nav	Im logging off. Hope you find what you looking for.
2010-02-28T15:47:00.000Z	abhi_nav	knoppies	how to make sure my PSU is not underpowerd? and before that what is PSU? What should ideal temp of my laptop be? its +0.0c now what +0.0 means?
2010-02-28T15:47:00.000Z	abhi_nav	knoppies	ok
