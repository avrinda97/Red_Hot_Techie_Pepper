2010-09-22T10:27:00.000Z	[V]ortex		hello; after installing ubuntu on another partition, i can't see that drive if i'm using windows xp; can anyone help? thanks
2010-09-22T10:29:00.000Z	sprung	[V]ortex	There is nothing wrong. Windows XP can't see ext3 file volumes. there are third-party programs for windows that you can use, but you would need to google to find them.
2010-09-22T10:30:00.000Z	sprung	[V]ortex	yes, using various programs like Partition Magic or just use the gparted boot disk
2010-09-22T10:32:00.000Z	sprung	[V]ortex	you are aware that from ubuntu, you can see your windows xp volume right?
2010-09-22T10:32:00.000Z	sprung	[V]ortex	i don't know why you would want to
2010-09-22T10:33:00.000Z	sprung	[V]ortex	gparted is free and open source and runs on a linux build on the cd
2010-09-22T10:33:00.000Z	sprung	[V]ortex	i'll save you the decision making process, just use gparted.
2010-09-22T10:35:00.000Z	sprung	[V]ortex	that's what i said
2010-09-22T10:36:00.000Z	sprung	[V]ortex	one last thing
2010-09-22T10:37:00.000Z	sprung	[V]ortex	if installing anything newer than windows XP, check out item #14 here before doing so (print it out) http://gparted.sourceforge.net/faq.php
2010-09-22T10:37:00.000Z	sprung	[V]ortex	just to save you a common headache
2010-09-22T10:40:00.000Z	sprung	[V]ortex	really it's easier than falling off a log with gparted, just read the instructions, the menu will guide you
2010-09-22T10:41:00.000Z	sprung	[V]ortex	if you have any problems with windows xp booting look at #13 on the same link i gave you a moment ago
2010-09-22T10:42:00.000Z	sprung	[V]ortex	i am assuming you are wanting to expand out your windows volume too, gparted lets you do that as well
2010-09-22T10:46:00.000Z	[V]ortex	sprung	ok thanks i'll go read up about gparted and how to use it
2010-09-22T10:46:00.000Z	sprung	[V]ortex	ok great, it's really not very difficult, read the FAQ too
2010-09-22T10:51:00.000Z	sprung	[V]ortex	you didn't say that you wanted it to be NTFS
2010-09-22T10:51:00.000Z	sprung	[V]ortex	you simply said you wanted to format it
2010-09-22T10:52:00.000Z	sprung	[V]ortex	thats what you get for not giving enough information
