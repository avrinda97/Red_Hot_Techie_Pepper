2010-10-01T11:17:00.000Z	philmikehock		Anyone familiar with xubuntu specifically?
2010-10-01T11:18:00.000Z	philmikehock		I am running xubuntu on 384mb of ram on a 1ghz p3 processor, to my understand it should be running rather smooth but it is not.
2010-10-01T11:18:00.000Z	philmikehock		What could be the reason why it is so slow?
2010-10-01T11:19:00.000Z	philmikehock		I mean literally, I just clicked to open the calculator and it took 3 seconds.
2010-10-01T11:19:00.000Z	philmikehock		Maybe 4.
2010-10-01T11:19:00.000Z	philmikehock		Is that normal?
2010-10-01T11:19:00.000Z	erfolg	philmikehock	1 ghz is going to be slow with that little ram.
2010-10-01T11:22:00.000Z	erfolg	philmikehock	more ram makes a difference. i'm not sure how much that would help though. 512 is decent with the p4 i've got in one of my computers but it's like 2.1 not 1 ghz. so it's going to be slow.
2010-10-01T11:23:00.000Z	erfolg	philmikehock	p3 is going to be slow.
2010-10-01T11:23:00.000Z	erfolg	philmikehock	i believe xubuntu uses thunar
2010-10-01T11:24:00.000Z	erfolg	philmikehock	as root?
2010-10-01T11:24:00.000Z	erfolg	philmikehock	alt+f2 then gksudo thunar
2010-10-01T11:26:00.000Z	erfolg	philmikehock	be careful
2010-10-01T11:26:00.000Z	erfolg	philmikehock	usually doing it in terminal is better.
2010-10-01T11:28:00.000Z	erfolg	philmikehock	try fluxbox if you like weird window managers. takes some configuration but it's actually really nice.
2010-10-01T11:29:00.000Z	erfolg	philmikehock	nah you'll be good w/ ubuntu. my ubuntu only uses like 350 mb/3.25gb at idle.
2010-10-01T11:29:00.000Z	erfolg	philmikehock	and your processor is plenty fast enough.
2010-10-01T11:33:00.000Z	erfolg	philmikehock	you've got grub installed.
2010-10-01T11:34:00.000Z	erfolg	philmikehock	no. grub is still installed no matter what.
