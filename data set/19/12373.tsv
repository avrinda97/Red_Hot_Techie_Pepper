2008-08-01T09:57:00.000Z	Flannel	xynthpop	Before that.  Before it broke.
2008-08-01T09:58:00.000Z	Flannel	xynthpop	Er... What?

2008-08-01T10:00:00.000Z	Flannel	xynthpop	Alright, well,  users and groups are set up last, so it might be that your install didn't finish properly.
2008-08-01T10:00:00.000Z	Flannel	xynthpop	You should ask in #ubuntustudio, they might know more.  Or try installing with an original Ubuntu, and then cnverting to ubuntu studio
2008-08-01T10:03:00.000Z	Flannel	xynthpop	Everything in ubuntu studio is available in the regular repositories.
2008-08-01T10:03:00.000Z	Flannel	xynthpop	So if you want just something specific, you can always just add that particular program
2008-08-01T10:20:00.000Z	Flannel	xynthpop	You just need two, one for / and one for swap.  Many times its better to have a separate (third) for /home.  You dfinately don't need six.
