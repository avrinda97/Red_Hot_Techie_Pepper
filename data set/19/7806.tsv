2007-06-23T16:11:00.000Z	Flannel	bobsomebody	there's no diffference between them.
2007-06-23T16:11:00.000Z	bobsomebody	Flannel	there is a HUGE difference between desktop and server
2007-06-23T16:12:00.000Z	Flannel	bobsomebody	no, there's absolutely no difference at all.  They are the same thing, just with different packages installed.
