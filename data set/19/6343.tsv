2008-02-09T17:13:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	C1P8	what made you consider upgrading/
2008-02-09T17:14:00.000Z	C1P8	IndyGunFreak	i saw a lot of repo were "brokenlink" and thinked it was about a gradually "pass trough" to the new version
2008-02-09T17:15:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	C1P8	pretty bad idea.
2008-02-09T17:15:00.000Z	C1P8	IndyGunFreak	yes..but i cant go back...and cant go forward..
2008-02-09T17:15:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	C1P8	so that leaves one option
2008-02-09T17:16:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	C1P8	so please tell me you didn't try upgrading to an alpha version of beta software w/o a current backup
2008-02-09T17:17:00.000Z	C1P8	IndyGunFreak	can i tell it to someoneother?

2008-02-09T17:18:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	C1P8	well, then that was really not smart.. at all.
2008-02-09T17:19:00.000Z	C1P8	IndyGunFreak	telling me i've to format and re installa trough cd?
2008-02-09T17:19:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	C1P8	i'm tellin you thats what i would do.
2008-02-09T17:20:00.000Z	C1P8	IndyGunFreak	i can backup all the home and put in the new or i'll risk problems?
2008-02-09T17:20:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	C1P8	that i don't know..
2008-02-09T17:27:00.000Z	C1P8	IndyGunFreak	for next time...what prog u suggest to backup all next time? and what to backup to repristinate? (i was abitued to ghosting all in windows..)
2008-02-09T17:28:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	C1P8	i don't do a backup with a *program*, i generally just keep current file backups.., usually i an have a clean install back where i want it in about an hour, and thast moving abot 40-50gigs of data off a USB drive.
