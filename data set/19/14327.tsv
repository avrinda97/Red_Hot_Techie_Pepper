2011-02-02T22:15:00.000Z	LinuxNoob		(sorry for asking twice, i need my labtop for school x_x) we are starting our A+ today
2011-02-02T22:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	LinuxNoob	 try the 'nomodeset' option (when you see a man at the bottom screen hit space, then f6)
2011-02-02T22:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	LinuxNoob	 some nvidia cards hav4e issues untill the nvidia drivers are installed.
2011-02-02T22:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	LinuxNoob	 hit some keys when you see the man to get to the advqanced optionbs screen
2011-02-02T22:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	LinuxNoob	 thats not the bios testing yoiu ram is it?
2011-02-02T22:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	LinuxNoob	 its your pc.. i dont know..
2011-02-02T22:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	LinuxNoob	 bios options normally exist to disable that.
2011-02-02T22:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	LinuxNoob	 you dident even see a liuttle man./logo at the bottom? perhaps you should of just been tappoing the space key as it was booting up.. its one of the first screens you see
2011-02-02T22:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	LinuxNoob	if you are booting from a flash drive. You can edit the files on the flash and make nomodeset the default.. but i dontr rember whsat the file names were. other then that they are in the syslinux config files/dir
2011-02-02T22:25:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	LinuxNoob	 hit F6 perhaps..
2011-02-02T22:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	LinuxNoob	 somewhere theres a menu item to select options. try to find the one that has 'nomodeset'
2011-02-02T22:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	LinuxNoob	 the nomode set options where befor you hit the install to hd optionsmenu
2011-02-02T22:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	LinuxNoob	 ive needed the nomnodeset optiuoin for all my nvidia systems for the last 2 or 3 releases
2011-02-02T22:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	LinuxNoob	 untill i get the nvidia drivers installed.
2011-02-02T22:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	LinuxNoob	  check the forums/install guides. I use thst option last time about 5+ mo ago. so cant rember exaxtly how
2011-02-05T22:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	LinuxNoob	 Ive had very fes issues with nvidia drivers. :)
2011-02-05T22:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	LinuxNoob	 other then needing 'nomodeset' initially. ive had very few issues with the actual droivers.. and the nomodeset is not really a 'driver'  issue.. its a  kernel type issue
