2012-10-25T23:38:00.000Z	max987		hi guys! my pretty fresh (1 day old) ubuntu installation just crashed and i dont find any error in /var/log/syslog ..
2012-10-25T23:39:00.000Z	NewWorld	max987	 when it crashed did it restart or shutdown totally?
2012-10-25T23:40:00.000Z	NewWorld	max987	 that's bad :/ not sure where the logs are sorry
2012-10-25T23:41:00.000Z	NewWorld	max987	 have you checked all those logs? sort by date and check ones that have been written to from the time of the crash onwards
2012-10-25T23:42:00.000Z	NewWorld	max987	 check messages, it requires root p/w though
2012-10-25T23:43:00.000Z	NewWorld	max987	 how are you trying to edit it? do `sedit /etc/fstab` to edit as root
2012-10-25T23:44:00.000Z	NewWorld	max987	 if it's deprecated my bad. I'm just throwing ideas at you
2012-10-25T23:45:00.000Z	NewWorld	max987	 what's the name of the file you're viewing? /var/log/messages.log , yes?
2012-10-25T23:47:00.000Z	NewWorld	max987	 this is mysterious. I dunno where else to check if it's not in /var/log
2012-10-25T23:47:00.000Z	NewWorld	max987	 how long before you noticed it crashed and it shutdown? Did it crash & shutdown immediatly?
2012-10-25T23:49:00.000Z	NewWorld	max987	 if it shutdown instantly, maybe it was a hardware fault. i'm just guessing though
2012-10-25T23:51:00.000Z	NewWorld	max987	 genii-around : when has X ever crashed and just flat-out shutdown the computer? usually X restarts or it throws you into shell
2012-10-25T23:54:00.000Z	NewWorld	max987	 I'm not 100% but it looks like just stuff to do with your network card. gnome-keyring manages keys for networks, ecore seems network-related since it has DNS in it's name.
2012-10-25T23:55:00.000Z	NewWorld	max987	 doubt that network stuff crashed your computer. Particularly if it's been outputting these errors before and after the crash
2012-10-25T23:57:00.000Z	NewWorld	max987	 if this happened only once, I'd just forget about it. also, i'd hate for this to be a hardware fault :/
2012-10-25T23:58:00.000Z	max987	NewWorld	seems like i cant do much anyways as logfiles are empty.. ofc i dont feel very confident about a crash without log entries on 2nd day of use (makes me guess it could be a HW / driver problem too :-( )
2012-10-25T23:59:00.000Z	NewWorld	max987	 keep your receipts and warranty docs
2012-10-26T00:00:00.000Z	max987	NewWorld	i will thanks. if problems occur again i will probably try another distro first or to update some drivers .. it worked pretty well and out of the box yet ..
2012-10-26T00:02:00.000Z	max987	NewWorld	genii-around: thanks for your help and time, have a nice day bb
