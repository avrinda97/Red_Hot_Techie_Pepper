2009-02-08T17:09:00.000Z	slaxaxe	lstarnes	it is picking up from the local repository
2009-02-08T17:10:00.000Z	slaxaxe	lstarnes	I need to update the local repository .... using apt-mirror... even then it says no new updates.....
2009-02-08T17:10:00.000Z	lstarnes	slaxaxe	change the servers in /etc/apt/sources.list manually or try changing them automatically with system > administration > software sources
2009-02-08T17:10:00.000Z	lstarnes	slaxaxe	or try changing the mirrors used by apt-mirror
2009-02-08T17:13:00.000Z	slaxaxe	lstarnes	this is what I have on my sources.list .... http://pastebin.com/pastebin.php?dl=m629749a3
2009-02-08T17:15:00.000Z	slaxaxe	lstarnes	this is my mirror.list http://paste.ubuntu.com/115607/plain/
2009-02-08T17:16:00.000Z	lstarnes	slaxaxe	I'm not sure, but to me it looks like it's set to mirror itself
2009-02-08T17:17:00.000Z	slaxaxe	lstarnes	this is what I did to redirect to my local repo .... sudo ln -sf /media/H-Drive-SATA116/Repository-intrepid/mirror/hyhhlnx0/ubuntu repo
2009-02-08T17:24:00.000Z	slaxaxe	lstarnes	hi ... can you suggest me a solution ???
2009-02-08T17:25:00.000Z	lstarnes	slaxaxe	reconfigure apt-mirror to mirror a different repository, or use apt with a remote repository instead of a local copy
2009-02-08T17:27:00.000Z	slaxaxe	lstarnes	well I guess I have to do that... till I figure out the issue with this.... anyway thanks for your help.... btw do you know about keryx  [ http://keryx.betaserver.org/ ] ???
2009-02-08T17:27:00.000Z	lstarnes	slaxaxe	I don't
