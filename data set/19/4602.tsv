2008-12-08T20:40:00.000Z	mulender	ikonia	but basically it IS down to the kernel version and the distro is ared herring?
2008-12-08T20:33:00.000Z	ikonia	mulender	no
2008-12-08T20:34:00.000Z	mulender	ikonia	so why not?
2008-12-08T20:34:00.000Z	ikonia	mulender	because ubuntu uses a different kernel version
2008-12-08T20:34:00.000Z	mulender	ikonia	so when Ubuntu starts using the same kernel it will be supported?
2008-12-08T20:35:00.000Z	ikonia	mulender	why would ubuntu use the same kernel, it's based on debian, not debian
2008-12-08T20:36:00.000Z	mulender	ikonia	so I may just have to use Debian with that laptop and lump it?
2008-12-08T20:36:00.000Z	ikonia	mulender	if you want
2008-12-08T20:37:00.000Z	mulender	ikonia	well I prefer Ubuntu but Debian works better on that system :(
2008-12-08T20:37:00.000Z	ikonia	mulender	ok
2008-12-08T20:41:00.000Z	ikonia	mulender	pretty much
2008-12-08T20:41:00.000Z	ikonia	mulender	wouldn't reommend it
2008-12-08T20:43:00.000Z	mulender	ikonia	So how come Lenny has the Newest Kernel? I thought it was more old fashioned distro. I need to read a lot more!
2008-12-08T20:43:00.000Z	ikonia	mulender	ask the debian guys
2008-12-08T20:44:00.000Z	mulender	ikonia	actually i will say one thing for Debian - their hardware support is amazing. It even worked on my old 98 machine.
