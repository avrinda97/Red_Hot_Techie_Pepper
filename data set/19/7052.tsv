2008-05-25T07:06:00.000Z	zcat[1]	shazzam	you already have it.. but you might want to install compizconfig-settings-manager package to turn on soem of the more fun effects
2008-05-25T07:07:00.000Z	zcat[1]	shazzam	what video card do you have?
2008-05-25T07:10:00.000Z	zcat[1]	shazzam	compiz-fusion is installed and running by default, with a limited set of eeffects enabled.
2008-05-25T07:34:00.000Z	zcat[1]	shazzam	if it said it can't be started that's probably because you don't have 3d drivers enabled yet..
2008-05-25T07:36:00.000Z	zcat[1]	shazzam	go to restricted drivers manager (system > admin > hardware drivers) and see if there are any drivers you could install but this probably won't work on a live CD boot, you need to do some kind of install, wubi perhaps)
2008-05-25T07:37:00.000Z	zcat[1]	shazzam	Well, you have an nvidia card, hardware drivers should suggest installing the nvidia drivers.
2008-05-25T08:11:00.000Z	zcat[1]	shazzam	I think I mentioned that almost an hour ago?
2008-05-25T08:12:00.000Z	zcat[1]	shazzam	put the disk in in Windows and do a wubi install.. turn off any AV software first tho 'cos it reads the CD into an ISO image and trying to scan a 700M file seems to bother most AV software
2008-05-25T08:15:00.000Z	zcat[1]	shazzam	wubi makes a big file in windows with all the stuff ubuntu needs to boot, then launches the kernel from windows boot manager.. you can completely remove it again if you don't like it.
