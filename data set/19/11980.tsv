2005-10-28T06:49:00.000Z	yi	Agrajag	i'm using the amd64 distribution
2005-10-28T06:49:00.000Z	Agrajag	yi	apt-cache search mplayer
2005-10-28T06:50:00.000Z	yi	Agrajag	nope, returns null
2005-10-28T06:51:00.000Z	Agrajag	yi	in 64-bit? Good luck.
2005-10-28T06:52:00.000Z	Agrajag	yi	instructions are on the wiki
2005-10-28T06:53:00.000Z	Agrajag	yi	silly question. You added multiverse to /etc/apt/sources.list right? Did you do an apt-get update since then?
2005-10-28T06:53:00.000Z	yi	Agrajag	yes
2005-10-28T07:03:00.000Z	Agrajag	yi	~/.bash_profile
2005-10-28T07:04:00.000Z	Agrajag	yi	the point is that ubuntu does things slightly different from another distro? then set it up yourself, have /etc/profile source everything in /etc/profile.d
2005-10-28T07:05:00.000Z	yi	Agrajag	no, the question was WHY ubuntu didn't have it
2005-10-28T07:05:00.000Z	yi	Agrajag	stop being such a fanboy and be quiet if you don't have a real answer.
