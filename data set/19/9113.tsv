2007-03-04T09:19:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	ubuntu_no_worky	if you like automatix, thats why your user name applies..lol
2007-03-04T09:21:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	ubuntu_no_worky	actually i've used automatix before also, and had no problems, but you'd swear you're Satans spawn from hell sent to destroy Ubuntu Linux if you bring it up here..lol
2007-03-04T09:22:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	ubuntu_no_worky	it is best to learn stuff on your own though, Automatix, EasyUbuntu, etc, they are ok, but its best to learn to do crap on your own.
2007-03-04T09:25:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	ubuntu_no_worky	is tha tlike Nero, the popular CD burning software
2007-03-04T09:26:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	ubuntu_no_worky	you know there's GnomeBaker and K3b, both very good CD burners in the repositories, that take about 10sec to install.
2007-03-04T09:26:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	ubuntu_no_worky	?  I'm starting to think youre unstable..lol, gnomebaker has been flawless for me
2007-03-04T09:27:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	ubuntu_no_worky	i believe you... i just donm't undersstand why you were havin the issue.
2007-03-04T09:38:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	ubuntu_no_worky	feisty will cause you more problems than it fixes..
2007-03-04T09:41:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	ubuntu_no_worky	i don't know then, you're other linux native apps are x-cdroast(which i hate), or gnomebaker
