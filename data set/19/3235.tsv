2009-09-25T01:06:00.000Z	cwall		hey there... how to fix "/etc/sudoers is mode 0640, should be 0440" remote?
2009-09-25T01:06:00.000Z	cwall		remotely
2009-09-25T01:06:00.000Z	jrib	cwall	no idea why it says that?
2009-09-25T01:07:00.000Z	cwall	jrib	i screwed w/ my sudoers file
2009-09-25T01:07:00.000Z	jrib	cwall	what did you do exactly?
2009-09-25T01:08:00.000Z	jrib	cwall	reboot in recovery mode and chmod it back
2009-09-25T01:08:00.000Z	cwall	jrib	my machine is remote... reboot into a runlevel w/ networkign?
2009-09-25T01:09:00.000Z	jrib	cwall	umm, I don't think you can fix this without physical access.  Did you happen to setup a root password?
2009-09-25T01:09:00.000Z	cwall	jrib	i didn't!  sigh
2009-09-25T01:11:00.000Z	jrib	cwall	no terminal with root access right?
2009-09-25T01:12:00.000Z	cwall	jrib	no, no terminal access w/ root user... i never changed the default root passwd
2009-09-25T01:12:00.000Z	cwall	jrib	thanks for help, btw
2009-09-25T01:12:00.000Z	jrib	cwall	you shouldn't but it would be a way to avoid physical access
2009-09-25T01:12:00.000Z	cwall	jrib	how to crack root passwd?... w/o sudo
2009-09-25T01:13:00.000Z	jrib	cwall	you can't, there isn't one.  Just get physical access to the server
2009-09-25T01:13:00.000Z	cwall	jrib	i feared... guess i'll have to get on a plane  :-(
2009-09-25T01:13:00.000Z	jrib	cwall	phone call and friend is probably cheaper :)
2009-09-25T01:14:00.000Z	cwall	jrib	think so...
2009-09-25T01:14:00.000Z	cwall	jrib	thanks!!!
