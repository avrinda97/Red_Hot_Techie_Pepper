2008-07-14T15:14:00.000Z	bboschman		Hi
2008-07-14T15:15:00.000Z	bboschman		I got a problem installing 8.04.1 on my DELL server (see screenshot: https://jesusch.de/~jesusch/img/ubuntu-error.jpg )
2008-07-14T15:15:00.000Z	bboschman		anyone aware of this problem?
2008-07-14T15:15:00.000Z	bboschman		all I found on google was regarding IDE master/slave stuff
2008-07-14T15:15:00.000Z	wols_	bboschman	secure connection failed. if you must have a https cert, use a proper one or it's useless
2008-07-14T15:16:00.000Z	bboschman	wols_	I care about secure passwords - not about spending money to cert authorities
2008-07-14T15:17:00.000Z	bboschman		so therefor it's not useless
2008-07-14T15:17:00.000Z	wols_	bboschman	so does my firefox. it just doesn't display your page since it deems it insecure and tampered with. have a nice day
2008-07-14T15:17:00.000Z	bboschman	wols_	there is a button to accept the selfsigned cert
2008-07-14T15:18:00.000Z	wols_	bboschman	wrong.
2008-07-14T15:18:00.000Z	wols_		unless I add a (permanent) exception
2008-07-14T15:19:00.000Z	wols_		and frankly your site is not worth that. if you want help you better make it easy for people wanting to help you. note how no one commeted on your problem yet?
2008-07-14T15:19:00.000Z	bboschman	wols_	so you suppose me to buy a ssl-cert for much money?
2008-07-14T15:19:00.000Z	wols_		no. I suggest not to use https for throwaway stuff like this
2008-07-14T15:19:00.000Z	wols_		!enter
2008-07-14T15:21:00.000Z	bboschman	wols_	I use https for the whole site - not only throwaway stuff
2008-07-14T15:21:00.000Z	wols_	bboschman	read what I just told you
2008-07-14T15:24:00.000Z	bboschman		I get the following error while booting 8.04.1 i386 server image: http://paste.debian.net/11152/
2008-07-14T15:24:00.000Z	bboschman	wols_	better? =)
