2008-05-27T07:00:00.000Z	etyrnal		how do i change the -depth of the mobitor's colors from the command line - i think either xorg or gdm are set to millions of colors, and i need it to be set to 256 colors (low mem vid card)
2008-05-27T07:01:00.000Z	fde	etyrnal	google 'default depth xorg'
2008-05-27T07:01:00.000Z	etyrnal	fde	thanks
2008-05-27T07:07:00.000Z	etyrnal	fde	have you looked at the insode of a xoeg.conf file?  there's nothing in there that even remotely resembles anything like -depth
2008-05-27T07:07:00.000Z	etyrnal	fde	i asked here because i have already wasted several hours on google, in the man pages, in the forums, and on irc
2008-05-27T07:08:00.000Z	fde	etyrnal	I'm well aware of that... hence why I told you to google... so you know what to add.
2008-05-27T07:10:00.000Z	fde	etyrnal	basically add DefaultDepth 16 (8bit I think) to screen section.
2008-05-27T07:12:00.000Z	etyrnal	fde	sorry - i'm just used to rtfm comments from people who assume i did not try on my own - so if i just add  "-depth 4" at the end, that'll do'er ?
2008-05-27T07:12:00.000Z	fde	etyrnal	If you don't want x to start on boot, sure.
2008-05-27T07:12:00.000Z	etyrnal	fde	sigh
2008-05-27T07:13:00.000Z	etyrnal	fde	why wouldn't it start?
2008-05-27T07:14:00.000Z	fde	etyrnal	How do you intend to enter that without it being in the config file?
2008-05-27T07:15:00.000Z	etyrnal	fde	 sudo nano -w /etc/X11/xorg.conf  -- thrn just put it at the end of the file...
2008-05-27T07:15:00.000Z	fde	etyrnal	DefaultDepth 4  added to Section "Screen" in that file would work.
2008-05-27T07:17:00.000Z	etyrnal	fde	that section has 3 lines - Identifier  "Default Screen" ; Monitor "Configured Monitor" ; Device "Configured Video Device" -- an dthat's it
2008-05-27T07:18:00.000Z	fde	etyrnal	Neat, if you do what I say, I'll have 4...
2008-05-27T07:18:00.000Z	etyrnal	fde	 found a sample xorg.conf
2008-05-27T07:23:00.000Z	etyrnal	fde	thanks - modified file - will be trying this later - i appreciate Your help
2008-05-27T07:23:00.000Z	etyrnal	fde	have a great evening
