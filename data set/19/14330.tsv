2010-06-20T08:50:00.000Z	noob123		do flv or mpg files from watching movies on the internet get saved in tmp files on ubuntu anywhere? any way to delete them?
2010-06-20T08:50:00.000Z	noob123		i used to have the shut down option on the upper right corner of the screen but now my chat thing is like overlapping it and i cant get access to it anymore.  I did right click and went 2 add panel to add the shut down icon again but is there anyway i can get the original one back?
2010-06-20T08:51:00.000Z	noob123		what janice?
2010-06-20T08:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	noob123	 also you may want to unlock and move the widgits around a little. could be they are overlapping.
2010-06-20T08:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	noob123	 move it to the left a little bit, add applets.. or just reset teh whole gnome panel.
2010-06-20T08:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	noob123	 in /tmp/ yes i think they do.  tmp gets cleaned out regullary
2010-06-20T08:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	noob123	 be more clear in what you are doing... you tuped 'what' exactly?
2010-06-20T08:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	noob123	 thats a bot trigger.. type the command the bot said...
2010-06-20T08:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	noob123	 amazing.  :) it restarted..
2010-06-20T09:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	noob123	 a user running some malware. in theory . can only trash their own files..
2010-06-20T09:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	noob123	 thats one of the many reasons for the 'layers' of security that ubuntu has.
2010-06-20T09:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	noob123	 you are confused about what terminal commands are..  they are the same as gui programs.. theres no real 'security' type differance.
2010-06-20T09:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	noob123	 just because they are terminal commands do not make them 'special'
2010-06-20T09:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	noob123	 the biggest danger to a ubuntu box i find is the users doing things they really shouldent be doing..
2010-06-20T09:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	noob123	 the term 'brick' is used when you break a bit of hardware, like a PSP, or gameboy normally
2010-06-20T09:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	noob123	 programs can do most anythiong.. :)  thats their nature..
2010-06-20T09:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	noob123	 its crazy that windows 'needs' av software the moment its installed... :)
2010-06-20T09:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	noob123	 look in the Applications menu? the bottom icon? thats the 'beginners' package manager tool. :)
2010-06-20T09:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	noob123	 and dont forget that file names and paths in linux ARE CaSe SeneSeTiVe.   file.txt is NOT the same as File.txt
