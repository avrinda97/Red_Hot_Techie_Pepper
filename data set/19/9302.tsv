2006-11-28T12:58:00.000Z	livingtm		dmraid is broken in edgy isnt it?
2006-11-28T12:58:00.000Z	livingtm		i had to use the alternate install cd to get dmraid working
2006-11-28T12:58:00.000Z	poolkey172	livingtm	: It worked for SIL chipset but it didnt work for VIA
2006-11-28T12:59:00.000Z	livingtm	poolkey172	er, i had to use the alternate install to use software raid instaid of fakeraid
2006-11-28T12:59:00.000Z	livingtm	poolkey172	i have an nvidia fakeraid

2006-11-28T13:00:00.000Z	livingtm	poolkey172	i didnt, i used software raid
2006-11-28T13:00:00.000Z	poolkey172	livingtm	: Ah ic
2006-11-28T13:00:00.000Z	livingtm	poolkey172	dmraid didnt pick up in it, saw it as two disks
2006-11-28T13:01:00.000Z	poolkey172	livingtm	: ic : I was in a pickle as my primary RAID already had windows on it and was unreadable from dmraid so I bought a second cheap fake RAID :)
2006-11-28T13:02:00.000Z	livingtm	poolkey172	i saw a real hardware raid card for 150 3ware.com
2006-11-28T13:02:00.000Z	poolkey172	livingtm	: 150 dollars ?
2006-11-28T13:02:00.000Z	livingtm	poolkey172	yes
2006-11-28T13:02:00.000Z	livingtm	poolkey172	for a 2 x SATA300
2006-11-28T13:03:00.000Z	livingtm	poolkey172	i didnt buy it, but i was looking into it
2006-11-28T13:04:00.000Z	poolkey172	livingtm	: 150 dollars  is not that bad you'r lookking at  150 uk pounds here
2006-11-28T13:04:00.000Z	livingtm	poolkey172	naw, thats USD
2006-11-28T13:05:00.000Z	livingtm	poolkey172	its probably not the best, but they explcitly say "Hardware RAID algorithms"
