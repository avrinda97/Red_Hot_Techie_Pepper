2006-05-21T07:03:00.000Z	siccness		Anyone know how to get menubar back on terminal?
2006-05-21T07:04:00.000Z	siccness		Not there
2006-05-21T07:04:00.000Z	siccness		Bah, it is too.
2006-05-21T07:04:00.000Z	siccness		I was clicking up the top (where it has the title)
2006-05-21T07:04:00.000Z	siccness		Heh, thanks dooglus/Samuli^
2006-05-21T07:04:00.000Z	Samuli^	siccness	I knew.
2006-05-21T07:05:00.000Z	siccness		Ahh fair enough
2006-05-21T07:05:00.000Z	siccness		Ok, here's a challenge, is it possible to remove the borders? :P
2006-05-21T07:05:00.000Z	siccness		So it's 100% transparent.
2006-05-21T07:06:00.000Z	siccness	dooglus	I just want to be able to make it have the text against my wallpaper
2006-05-21T07:07:00.000Z	siccness		so it looks geekish in screenshots
2006-05-21T07:07:00.000Z	siccness		:) So I'll have a look at other window managers
2006-05-21T07:08:00.000Z	Samuli^	siccness	there's ways with metacity too.
