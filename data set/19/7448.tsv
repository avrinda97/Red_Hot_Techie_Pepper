2007-08-20T14:32:00.000Z	MrCollins	tuxpower	 I would suggest installing helix player for linux

2007-08-20T14:32:00.000Z	MrCollins		you can do sudo apt-cache search helix
2007-08-20T14:32:00.000Z	tuxpower		Mr.Collins ok shall i uninstall any multimedia codecs first? and also MPlayer plugin for firefox?
2007-08-20T14:34:00.000Z	tuxpower	MrCollins	should i uninstall MPlayer plugin for firefox before installing helix player?
