2006-05-01T08:57:00.000Z	rob138		is there anyway to get to my computer that is on my schools network that is not pingable from the internet?
2006-05-01T08:58:00.000Z	rukuartic	rob138	Yeah, I use ssh too. Great thing. :D "sudo apt-get install openssh-client open-sshserver"
2006-05-01T09:01:00.000Z	rukuartic	rob138	What types of connections are you on?
2006-05-01T09:03:00.000Z	rukuartic	rob138	So you're connecting on an intranet?
2006-05-01T09:03:00.000Z	rukuartic	rob138	Or an internet?
2006-05-01T09:04:00.000Z	rob138	rukuartic	i believe intranet (it's a school building's LAN, through ethernet, if that helps)
2006-05-01T09:05:00.000Z	rukuartic	rob138	Yep, you're right. So you get a connection, but it keeps dropping? What port are you using?
2006-05-01T09:06:00.000Z	rob138	rukuartic	i cannot get a connection is my problem, i cannot ssh 147.222.178.28 unless i am connected on the same LAN
2006-05-01T09:06:00.000Z	rukuartic	rob138	Yeah. Its going to be difficult to telnet to your computer from anywhere else but from inside the intranet. Have you successfully connected from outside before?
2006-05-01T09:07:00.000Z	rukuartic	rob138	In order to connect to your computer, you'd need the root router (the one that distributes internet to the campus) to directly redirect all SSH connections to your computer
2006-05-01T09:08:00.000Z	rob138	rukuartic	N2DIY, so it's probably impossible for me to?
2006-05-01T09:09:00.000Z	rukuartic	rob138	Not quite sure. Try contacting your sysadmin, see if he has any solutions. Or try a few different ports.
2006-05-01T09:09:00.000Z	rob138	rukuartic	but that IP adress is not even pingable from outside the network, so using a different port wouldnt work right?
2006-05-01T09:10:00.000Z	rukuartic	rob138	No, they have the router set to be not pingable to prevent from attacks. I can't ping my own router, but I can still connect to it. Thing is, I say "forward all port 22" (thats ssh) "to 192.168.1.101" (thats my computer)
2006-05-01T09:11:00.000Z	rukuartic	rob138	When the head router at the campus (connected directly to the internet) gets a packet saying "I want to connect to ssh!" the router says "OK! Where do I send it? There's a million computers on campus."
2006-05-01T09:11:00.000Z	rukuartic	rob138	So you'd need to ask the system administrator to forward one port to your computer. depending on the size of the campus, that may or may not be too hard.
2006-05-01T09:11:00.000Z	rukuartic	rob138	Or possibly he may have a solution for you :P
2006-05-01T09:13:00.000Z	rob138	rukuartic	thanks, don't know if the admin will be helpful, they are assholes here
2006-05-01T09:15:00.000Z	rukuartic	rob138	=\
