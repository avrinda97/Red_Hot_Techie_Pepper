2008-04-05T12:42:00.000Z	math		good morning, everyone..
2008-04-05T12:43:00.000Z	math		how do I enable my two cores? Having a Core 2 Duo 6600, under /proc/cpuinfo I just see one core
2008-04-05T12:44:00.000Z	hischild	math	type uname -a and tell me what it tells you
2008-04-05T12:45:00.000Z	math	hischild	Linux mise-en-place 2.6.22-14-386 #1 Tue Feb 12 07:12:19 UTC 2008 i686 GNU/Linux
2008-04-05T12:45:00.000Z	hischild	math	is that a default Ubuntu kernel? it's missing SMP support
2008-04-05T12:46:00.000Z	math	hischild	but how can I switch back to the smp kernel.. I don't changed anything, but I remember that in old days (around feisty) all worked well....
2008-04-05T12:47:00.000Z	math	hischild	I'm running Gutsy ATM
2008-04-05T12:47:00.000Z	hischild	math	did you install a new kernel yourself?
2008-04-05T12:48:00.000Z	math	hischild	now, (I even dunno how to accomplish that)
2008-04-05T12:49:00.000Z	math	hischild	I made just a distupgrade (months ago..), and supplied updates (including kernel updates via automatic updates) and now I've taken an accidental look at top and /proc/cpuinfo.. and who.. wheres my second core gone?
2008-04-05T12:50:00.000Z	hischild	math	well that's just odd. See in your /boot if you have any other kernel other then the mise one.
2008-04-05T12:51:00.000Z	math	hischild	seems not..
2008-04-05T12:52:00.000Z	math	hischild	meaning, I can't find one with a smp string in its name
2008-04-05T12:52:00.000Z	hischild	math	and you won't.
2008-04-05T12:53:00.000Z	hischild	math	it doesn't show smp in the line. Look for a different kernel.
2008-04-05T12:54:00.000Z	math	hischild	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/62218/
2008-04-05T12:56:00.000Z	hischild	math	seems like you're booting the wrong kernel. (also: the french channel can help)
2008-04-05T13:12:00.000Z	math	hischild	thanks ubuntu-de helped me out: as you suggested, was wrong kernel: linux-386 instead of linux-386-generic thanks a lot
2008-04-05T13:12:00.000Z	hischild	math	you're welcome.
