2008-05-10T05:39:00.000Z	blahblahx		could anyone provide me with specific help in a PM?
2008-05-10T05:40:00.000Z	Daisuke_Ido	blahblahx	keep questions in the channel.  it allows more people to answer if they know, and doesn't make the person you're targeting feel pressured.
2008-05-10T05:40:00.000Z	blahblahx	Daisuke_Ido	its a very long and specific question
2008-05-10T05:41:00.000Z	Daisuke_Ido	blahblahx	then ask it already.
2008-05-10T05:41:00.000Z	blahblahx	Daisuke_Ido	ahh so nice here.
2008-05-10T05:43:00.000Z	Daisuke_Ido	blahblahx	i'm not trying to be mean, it's just that if you have a question, you ask in the channel.  i know it's a specific problem, but what if someone else is having that same specific problem.
2008-05-10T05:47:00.000Z	Daisuke_Ido	blahblahx	the main question, i think, is did you update from mint or ubuntu repositories?
2008-05-10T05:48:00.000Z	blahblahx	Daisuke_Ido	it has both. but thats how the others upgraded.
2008-05-10T05:48:00.000Z	blahblahx	Daisuke_Ido	it uses grubgfx instead
2008-05-10T05:48:00.000Z	blahblahx	Daisuke_Ido	which is basically the same
2008-05-10T05:51:00.000Z	blahblahx	Daisuke_Ido	any ideas?
2008-05-10T05:52:00.000Z	Daisuke_Ido	blahblahx	the only thing i can think of off the top of my head is to actually install grub, but it really shouldn't require that.
2008-05-10T05:52:00.000Z	Daisuke_Ido	blahblahx	i have an idea though.
2008-05-10T05:52:00.000Z	blahblahx	Daisuke_Ido	do tell
2008-05-10T05:53:00.000Z	Daisuke_Ido	blahblahx	what if you create a symlink that links /boot/grubgfx to /boot/grub (and similarly, link grub-update)
2008-05-10T05:53:00.000Z	blahblahx	Daisuke_Ido	hmm thats a thought
2008-05-10T05:54:00.000Z	Daisuke_Ido	blahblahx	my thought is that if they work pretty similarly, it's worth a shot
2008-05-10T05:54:00.000Z	blahblahx	Daisuke_Ido	not a bad idea
2008-05-10T05:56:00.000Z	blahblahx	Daisuke_Ido	oh wait the original has a /boot/grub
