2008-08-01T13:06:00.000Z	blankthemuffin		Is there a way to access the alternate installer from the normal install disk, I presumed the problems with the GeForce 6800 would be fixed by now but not to be.
2008-08-01T13:07:00.000Z	blankthemuffin		cp is copy. in the terminal.
2008-08-01T13:09:00.000Z	blankthemuffin		You guys are suggesting cards which will probably be worth a bundle more since they are antiques. I'd be putting forward the option of a GeForce 6600 but it really depends where you're sourcing it from I suppose.
2008-08-01T13:11:00.000Z	blankthemuffin		Yeah it's not that I can't install the drivers, I install the binary drivers from nvidia manually. But the problem is the live CD crashes due to trying to load the nv driver.
2008-08-01T13:12:00.000Z	blankthemuffin		I suppose I'll just download the alternate cd.
2008-08-01T13:13:00.000Z	blankthemuffin		I need to manually set the driver to vesa or it crashes.
2008-08-01T13:15:00.000Z	iustinus	blankthemuffin	I have a GeForce 6800, and it was working fine until I switched monitors, because the new Xorg release doesn't allow video questions on dpkg-reconfigure.
2008-08-01T13:15:00.000Z	blankthemuffin	iustinus	it's probably related to the GS version only then, which have you got?
2008-08-01T13:15:00.000Z	iustinus	blankthemuffin	GX
2008-08-01T13:16:00.000Z	blankthemuffin	iustinus	the nv driver causes crashes on mine, so I need to use vesa until I can install the real binary drivers.
2008-08-01T13:16:00.000Z	iustinus	blankthemuffin	I can't get any good resolutions on this monitor
2008-08-01T13:17:00.000Z	blankthemuffin	iustinus	there is a nvidia application which does it automagically.
2008-08-01T13:17:00.000Z	blankthemuffin	iustinus	nvidia-xconfig
2008-08-01T13:17:00.000Z	iustinus	blankthemuffin	I can't get it to work. Which drive should be installed? Restricted hardware.
2008-08-01T13:18:00.000Z	blankthemuffin	iustinus	oh ok, I'm not sure with that, I personally use the binary drivers straight from the nvidia website, but EnvyNG is probably your best bet.

2008-08-01T13:19:00.000Z	iustinus	blankthemuffin	ah, should I just DL the binary drivers from NVIDIA then?
2008-08-01T13:20:00.000Z	blankthemuffin	iustinus	I do, but generally its not recommended because you have to know your way around a command line pretty well, EnvyNG is probably a much better option.
2008-08-01T13:30:00.000Z	iustinus	blankthemuffin	After installing the envyng driver and running nvidia-xconfig, I still have shite screen resolutions. =/
