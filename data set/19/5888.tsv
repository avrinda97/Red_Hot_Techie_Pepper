2008-08-24T04:08:00.000Z	lwizardl		Has anyone here setup a point of sale cash register using Linux?
2008-08-24T04:10:00.000Z	lwizardl		yeah i've read these but seems 99% of the Linux software for POS is for food or resturants
2008-08-24T04:11:00.000Z	hari_	lwizardl	Unfortunately, the company I work for just set one up for a woman, but we ended up using windows, cause the windows program had very large colorful buttons, which was important, because the woman is going blind.
2008-08-24T04:13:00.000Z	lwizardl	hari_	yeah I currently have 5 computers setup to test various pos applications (Ubuntu, Kubuntu, Xubuntu, Windows 2k, Windows XP) and none I have found I truly like so far. the system will mainly be used by myself (i'll be 29 on the 29th of this month, and my vision is fine) :)
2008-08-24T04:16:00.000Z	lwizardl	hari_	so does that mean you know alot about register setups?
2008-08-24T04:20:00.000Z	hari_	lwizardl	Um, not really...
2008-08-24T04:20:00.000Z	hari_	lwizardl	I'm trying to put together a CRM system for Tech Support companies now, under GPL...
2008-08-24T04:20:00.000Z	hari_	lwizardl	But, that's about it.
2008-08-24T04:21:00.000Z	lwizardl	hari_	ah ok I'm just in the purchasing hardware phase for building my pos system
2008-08-24T04:22:00.000Z	lwizardl	hari_	I got 5 computers that I'm going to use for the registers, I was giving a EPSON TM-U220B receipt printer (retail is roughly $300), I bought the cash drawer, and ordering the display pole, printer/cash drawer cable, and the barcode scanner next week
2008-08-24T04:23:00.000Z	hari_	lwizardl	What industry are you in?
2008-08-24T04:25:00.000Z	lwizardl	hari_	video game retail
2008-08-24T04:25:00.000Z	hari_	lwizardl	Hmm...  That shouldn't be that difficult to set up...
2008-08-24T04:26:00.000Z	hari_	lwizardl	Novell has something called SUSE Enterprise Linux Point of Sale
2008-08-24T04:29:00.000Z	lwizardl	hari_	yeah I was looking at that but from what I can tell it seems targeted mainly for resturants
2008-08-24T04:29:00.000Z	hari_	lwizardl	http://sourceforge.net/projects/l-ane/
2008-08-24T04:32:00.000Z	hari_	lwizardl	L`ane looks like it was designed for retail environments.  It just also looks like it'd take a couple of days to get set up.
2008-08-24T04:33:00.000Z	lwizardl	hari_	 a couple days to get setup that ok I'm willing to do that but the major thing is that any package I use must be able to integrate and read my stock levels from my web database
