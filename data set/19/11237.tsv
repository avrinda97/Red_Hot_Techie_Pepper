2006-03-06T10:07:00.000Z	scelestus		anyone get an intel PRO/Wireless 2200BG to work in breezy?
2006-03-06T10:08:00.000Z	farous	scelestus	working here out of the box
2006-03-06T10:15:00.000Z	farous	scelestus	did you check it by pinging a server for example
2006-03-06T10:15:00.000Z	farous	scelestus	and it is still not working
2006-03-06T10:16:00.000Z	scelestus	farous	 correct
2006-03-06T10:16:00.000Z	farous	scelestus	on my machine turned out that i can use the external bottons to boot it or not check that
2006-03-06T10:16:00.000Z	scelestus	farous	it may be timing out getting an IP from my router...my router can take 30 secs
2006-03-06T10:17:00.000Z	farous	scelestus	then check your config. I do not know if configured it or not
2006-03-06T10:18:00.000Z	farous	scelestus	that is too long by the way. sorry do not know how to set the timeout though
2006-03-06T10:18:00.000Z	scelestus	farous	I am trying to see if I can change it in the router
2006-03-06T10:20:00.000Z	farous	scelestus	before that just general tips. Disable the ethernet if it is enabled. Use dhcp. sudo ifdown eth1 && sudo ifup eth1
2006-03-06T10:20:00.000Z	scelestus	farous	thanks ill try that
2006-03-06T10:56:00.000Z	scelestus	farous	it says "no working leases in persistent database  - sleeping"  any ideas?
2006-03-06T10:56:00.000Z	farous	scelestus	sorry what are you trying to do again
2006-03-06T10:57:00.000Z	scelestus	farous	 getting my intel 2200 working
2006-03-06T10:57:00.000Z	farous	scelestus	i guess it is your router. disable any security till it work so now wep or wpa
2006-03-06T10:57:00.000Z	farous	scelestus	then enable them again just trying to hunt down the problem
2006-03-06T10:58:00.000Z	scelestus	farous	 ok ill try it..thanks
2006-03-06T10:58:00.000Z	farous	scelestus	did you set it right though your dns is your router address by the way
