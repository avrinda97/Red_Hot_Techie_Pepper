2006-10-10T06:48:00.000Z	DethKlok		Anyone setup SNMP under linux?
2006-10-10T06:48:00.000Z	sethk	DethKlok	which mail server?
2006-10-10T06:48:00.000Z	sethk	DethKlok	sorry, not mail server
2006-10-10T06:48:00.000Z	sethk	DethKlok	I was reading snmp and seeing smtp
2006-10-10T06:48:00.000Z	DethKlok	sethk	yeah i feel your pain
2006-10-10T06:51:00.000Z	sethk	DethKlok	that doesn't really make sense.  there are snmp modules for various types of hardware, there are snmp monitoring tools, but there is no such thing as "snmp" itself
2006-10-10T06:54:00.000Z	sethk	DethKlok	it isn't bashing to ask you to clarify a question that is, as stated, impossible to answer.
2006-10-10T06:55:00.000Z	sethk	DethKlok	you may think there is only one interpretation, but that's not the case.
2006-10-10T06:55:00.000Z	DethKlok	sethk	<3
2006-10-10T06:57:00.000Z	sethk	DethKlok	I don't understand why you don't explain what you want to _do_, rather than assuming that a particular protocol or technology is the way to do it.
2006-10-10T06:58:00.000Z	DethKlok	sethk	is snmp already installed with ubuntu
2006-10-10T06:58:00.000Z	sethk	DethKlok	if you understood what snmp is, you wouldn't say something like that.
2006-10-10T06:58:00.000Z	DethKlok	sethk	i just want to configure snmp to use the public community with UDP port 161
2006-10-10T06:59:00.000Z	DethKlok	sethk	thats all i know how to do inorder to make cacti work aye
2006-10-10T07:00:00.000Z	sethk	DethKlok	that's the default port.  if you start any SNMP program it will use that port.
2006-10-10T07:00:00.000Z	DethKlok	sethk	as of right now Cacti gives me SNMP error
2006-10-10T07:00:00.000Z	sethk	DethKlok	but that isn't really what you want to do.
2006-10-10T07:00:00.000Z	sethk	DethKlok	snmp works by running agents on the hardware that is to be monitored.
2006-10-10T07:00:00.000Z	sethk	DethKlok	you have to start the agents the monitor the things you are interested in.
