2007-02-03T10:04:00.000Z	Squee	Not-Mnf	- ahh i had that problem, see... ubutnu provides nvidia-glx-common.  So you have to remove that... but when you remove that it will try to remove linux-restricted-whatnot which contains drivers
2007-02-03T10:04:00.000Z	Not-Mnf	Squee	so what should i do?
2007-02-03T10:05:00.000Z	Squee	Not-Mnf	- try this:  sudo gedit /etc/default/linux-restricted-modules-common and in the disabled modules disable nvidia
2007-02-03T10:06:00.000Z	Not-Mnf	Squee	does that install the dirvers? i want to install the nvidia glx drivers,
