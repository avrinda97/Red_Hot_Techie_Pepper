2007-11-17T04:46:00.000Z	pwnt-	nickrud	i'm on add-ons TAB now. there is no plugin "totem-mozilla"
2007-11-17T04:46:00.000Z	nickrud	pwnt-	both of those are packages you install/uninstall in synaptic
2007-11-17T04:47:00.000Z	pwnt-	nickrud	awesome
2007-11-17T04:48:00.000Z	pwnt-	nickrud	I just saw that both of them were installed. mozilla-plugin-vlc and mozilla-totem
2007-11-17T04:48:00.000Z	nickrud	pwnt-	try about:plugins in mozilla, it should see them automatically
2007-11-17T04:49:00.000Z	nickrud	pwnt-	erm, firefox that is :)
2007-11-17T04:51:00.000Z	nickrud	pwnt-	ok, remove mozilla-mplayer as well
2007-11-17T04:55:00.000Z	pwnt-	nickrud	also you, can I send to you a screenshot?
2007-11-17T04:56:00.000Z	nickrud	pwnt-	take your browser to http://fredrik.hubbe.net/plugger/test.html test some codecs
2007-11-17T04:57:00.000Z	nickrud	pwnt-	video in browsers is problematic sometimes... and maybe andi5 knows more about it than I
2007-11-17T04:58:00.000Z	pwnt-	nickrud	your website I clicked it. and when i clicked "Quicktime" Old codec. it shows the same as my screenshot, the (No video) in the middle like that
2007-11-17T05:00:00.000Z	nickrud	pwnt-	switching over from mplayer, a sec
2007-11-17T05:02:00.000Z	nickrud	pwnt-	it appears that vlc doesn't play quicktime, see http://www.videolan.org/vlc/features.html
2007-11-17T05:03:00.000Z	nickrud	pwnt-	erm, never mind, it is listed. But I get the same no video text
