2008-07-27T11:01:00.000Z	rexus		hi guys, can i install firefox 2 altogether with firefox 3 in the same system?
2008-07-27T11:01:00.000Z	ankit_	rexus	yes.
2008-07-27T11:02:00.000Z	ankit_	rexus	sudo apt-get install firefox-2
2008-07-27T11:02:00.000Z	ankit_	rexus	or search for firefox-2 in synaptic, if you prefer the GUI
2008-07-27T11:03:00.000Z	rexus	ankit_	I already have firefox 3 installed , currently I'm using 8.04
2008-07-27T11:03:00.000Z	ankit_	rexus	I'm fairly sure if you install the firefox-2 package, you can choose between firefox 2 and 3... they should have different entries in the Applications -> Internet menu
2008-07-27T11:04:00.000Z	ankit_	rexus	I'm actually just installing firefox-2 myself
2008-07-27T11:05:00.000Z	rexus	ankit_	are you using 8.04 as well?
2008-07-27T11:05:00.000Z	ankit_	rexus	yes
2008-07-27T11:05:00.000Z	ankit_	rexus	if you wait for a minute, I'll tell you how the install goes
2008-07-27T11:06:00.000Z	rexus	ankit_	how do you installed the firefox 2? using the synaptic?
2008-07-27T11:06:00.000Z	rexus	ankit_	I can wait
2008-07-27T11:07:00.000Z	ankit_	rexus	works great, I can choose between firefox-2 and firefox-3 in the menu, firefox-3 is still the default. the settings are shared between them... even tab sessions, which is pretty cool.
2008-07-27T11:08:00.000Z	rexus	ankit_	did you install it using synaptic?
2008-07-27T11:09:00.000Z	ankit_	rexus	no, I used the command-line and apt-get, but it's the same thing... synaptic is just a front-end for apt-get, so you can use either.
2008-07-27T11:11:00.000Z	ankit_	rexus	do you want firefox-2 to be your default browser?
2008-07-27T11:11:00.000Z	rexus	ankit_	no..
2008-07-27T11:13:00.000Z	ankit_	rexus	then you don't need to tinker update-alternatives. just install firefox-2 and then you should be fine.
2008-07-27T11:13:00.000Z	rexus	ankit_	let me try your way first
