2011-11-26T19:37:00.000Z	elgaton	arcaico	When a release reaches EOL the packages and list files are removed from the server, that explains the error.

2011-11-26T19:39:00.000Z	arcaico	elgaton	I need to install the JRE sun-java6-jre on ubuntu karmic, what repository must I use?
2011-11-26T19:39:00.000Z	elgaton	arcaico	You'll have to install manually since Sun Java has been removed for licensing reasons.
2011-11-26T19:39:00.000Z	elgaton	arcaico	Just download from Oracle's Web site or use OpenJDK.
2011-11-26T19:49:00.000Z	arcaico	elgaton	I need to use this JVM from SUN because I use an source code that has an library that only runs at SUN
2011-11-26T19:50:00.000Z	arcaico	elgaton	I tried to use on OpenJDK but doesnt runs
