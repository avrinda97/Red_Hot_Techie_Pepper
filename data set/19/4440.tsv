2009-01-14T06:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mdg2	its in your bios setup
2010-08-27T07:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mdg2	you mean you instaled ubuntu and installed fluxbox on it...
2010-08-27T07:03:00.000Z	mdg2	ActionParsnip	fluxbuntu
2010-08-27T07:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mdg2	its not supported here
2010-08-27T07:04:00.000Z	mdg2	ActionParsnip	so if it is ubuntu using fluxbox - that's different?
2010-08-27T07:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mdg2	its not a canonical release so isnt supported in the official channel
2010-08-27T07:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mdg2	those are ALL based on Ubuntu and equally not supported here, just like fluxbuntu
2010-08-27T07:05:00.000Z	mdg2	ActionParsnip	what about fluxbox specifically?
2010-08-27T07:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mdg2	there is #fluxbuntu
2010-08-27T07:06:00.000Z	mdg2	ActionParsnip	where do I go to ask about ubuntu running from a flash drive?
2010-08-27T07:07:00.000Z	mdg2	ActionParsnip	can anyone tell me what is the minimum and maximum sizes of flash drive to be used for a USB install of ubuntu?
2010-08-27T07:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mdg2	you can put the liveCD n usb for 700Mb. an installed system can range from about 2Gb upwards
2010-08-27T07:09:00.000Z	mdg2	ActionParsnip	thanks :)
2010-08-27T07:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mdg2	if you want super tiny then install the minimal iso to the device then install fluxbox or openbox, will make a super tiny OS
2011-01-02T06:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mdg2	what did you install?
2011-01-02T06:14:00.000Z	mdg2	ActionParsnip	four updates for enlighttenment
2011-01-02T06:18:00.000Z	mdg2	ActionParsnip	I have my history.log for apt - any hints how to go about undoing the upgrade of those four packages in enlightment?
2011-01-02T06:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mdg2	not sure, you could remove the packages then find debs for the older version, its gonna get messy
2011-01-02T06:21:00.000Z	mdg2	ActionParsnip	bummer!  one of these four packages took awy my ability to shutdown from anything other than CLI - not to nice in enlightenment
