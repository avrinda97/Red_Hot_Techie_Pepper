2008-09-07T11:58:00.000Z	Evill		Same white screen, although the cursor does change over certain areas, so it appears to be a video issue.
2008-09-07T12:00:00.000Z	Evill		Although gnome doesn't seem to think it has any problems.
2008-09-07T12:00:00.000Z	Evill		Cheers, shey.
2008-09-07T12:02:00.000Z	Evill		Well.. gnome boots up, shows the login screen.
2008-09-07T12:02:00.000Z	Evill		That works fine.
2008-09-07T12:02:00.000Z	Evill		Once I log in, it goes white with moveable cursor.
2008-09-07T12:02:00.000Z	Evill		The cursor does change to eyebeam over certain places. So gnome probably thinks it is fine.
2008-09-07T12:03:00.000Z	Evill		I've been switching in and out of console using Ctrl-Alt-F2 & F7 as shey suggested.
2008-09-07T12:03:00.000Z	Evill		But naturally I can't startx as gnome is currently running.

2008-09-07T12:03:00.000Z	tj83	Evill	how about the xorg.conf? can you pasebinit?
2008-09-07T12:05:00.000Z	tj83	Evill	sudo apt-get install pasebinit then pastebinit /etc/X11/Xorg.conf
2008-09-07T12:10:00.000Z	tj83	Evill	there is no defined video driver in your xorg.conf.. the default is vesa wish may not be supporting your card.. its a generic driver
2008-09-07T12:11:00.000Z	Evill	tj83	Even though the login screen works fine?
2008-09-07T12:16:00.000Z	tj83	Evill	just a suggestion.. i would start making backups of your file before making changes :) even with dpkg
2008-09-07T12:20:00.000Z	tj83	Evill	Ctrl+Alt+backspace should do the trick.. yes
2008-09-07T12:21:00.000Z	Evill	tj83	and dr_willis, thanks.
2008-09-07T12:25:00.000Z	tj83	Evill	nice... what did you do?
2008-09-07T12:26:00.000Z	Evill	tj83	Thanks1
