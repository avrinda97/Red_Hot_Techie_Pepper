2010-05-19T06:01:00.000Z	mrgenixus	Jordan_U	there's something to be said for staying with convention
2010-05-19T06:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mrgenixus	Convention is broken, ask Ubuntu's grub maintainers that have had to deal with bug reports about the unintuitive behavior of legacy update-grub
2010-05-19T06:03:00.000Z	mrgenixus	Jordan_U	ok --  fine.  it WAS a pain -- the devil you know and all -- that doesn't allow me to correct the issue
2010-05-19T06:05:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mrgenixus	Could you pastebin your grub.cfg?
2010-05-19T06:06:00.000Z	mrgenixus	Jordan_U	and not with grub
2010-08-17T04:04:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mrgenixus	Do you have the grub-pc package installed?
2010-08-17T04:04:00.000Z	mrgenixus	Jordan_U	indeed
2010-08-17T04:04:00.000Z	mrgenixus	Jordan_U	relevance?
2010-08-17T04:05:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mrgenixus	Your earlier question about your grub.cfg not being updated when a new kernel is installed.
2010-08-17T04:05:00.000Z	mrgenixus	Jordan_U	as I say, I think I can work around that by booting manually and google suggests that I run 'grup-update', which I have done, but not tested, but will probably bring my grub config up to date
2010-08-17T04:06:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mrgenixus	It's update-grub.
2011-08-17T22:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mrgenixus	Why?
2011-08-17T22:24:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mrgenixus	The steps for booting manually with grub2 are almost identical to those for grub legacy. The only differences you're likely to encounter are 1: It's "root=(hdX,Y)" rather than "root (hdX,Y)" and 2: Partitions are numbered from 1 instead of from zero.
2011-08-17T22:25:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mrgenixus	Sorry, and rather than "kernel /path/to/vmlinuz" it's "linux /path/to/vmlinuz".
2011-08-17T22:25:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mrgenixus	What problem are you having specifically?
2011-08-17T22:28:00.000Z	mrgenixus	Jordan_U	specifically, my system loads grub, never loads the OS
2011-08-17T22:29:00.000Z	mrgenixus	Jordan_U	It may just be taking a long time...
2011-08-17T22:33:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mrgenixus	Have you tried the recovery mode entry in the grub menu?
