2010-09-21T09:39:00.000Z	histo	jerry_	what version of ubuntu are you running?
2010-09-21T09:40:00.000Z	histo	jerry_	cat /etc/issue
2010-09-21T09:41:00.000Z	histo	jerry_	if you run that command in a terminal it will tell you what version you are running.
2010-09-21T09:41:00.000Z	histo	jerry_	yes
2010-09-21T09:41:00.000Z	histo	jerry_	unless you create a seperate home partition.  If you upgrade it will keep your data
2010-09-21T09:42:00.000Z	histo	jerry_	and by upgrade I mean using the package manager to upgrade to the most current release.
2010-09-21T09:42:00.000Z	histo	jerry_	however if you want to install the newest version from cd and keep your stuff create a seperate home
2010-09-21T09:43:00.000Z	histo	jerry_	what version do you have installed?  open a terminal and type in cat /etc/issue
2010-09-21T09:44:00.000Z	histo	jerry_	are you able to run that command?
2010-09-21T09:44:00.000Z	histo	jerry_	Applications > Accesories > terminal
2010-09-21T09:45:00.000Z	histo	jerry_	then type in "cat /etc/issue"   no quotes ofcourse
2010-09-21T09:45:00.000Z	histo	jerry_	you can use the update manager to upgrade to 9.10 then 10.04
2010-09-21T09:45:00.000Z	histo	jerry_	or actually you maybe able to update directly to 10.04
2010-09-21T09:46:00.000Z	histo	jerry_	System > Administration > UPdate manager
2010-09-21T09:46:00.000Z	histo	jerry_	up top it will have a button for upgrading the to a newer version
2010-09-21T09:47:00.000Z	histo	jerry_	not if you upgrade from the update manager
2010-09-21T09:47:00.000Z	histo	jerry_	if you install fresh from cd it will format the drive.
2010-09-21T09:48:00.000Z	histo	jerry_	however I suggest making a seperate home that way you don't have to worry int he future.  Once you are done upgrading
