2010-06-01T08:37:00.000Z	Izinucs		Why does 8.04 LTS not have a prompt to upgrade to 10.04 LTS?
2010-06-01T08:37:00.000Z	edbian	Izinucs	Go to system -> admin 0
2010-06-01T08:37:00.000Z	edbian	Izinucs	go to system -> admin -> software sources
2010-06-01T08:38:00.000Z	edbian	Izinucs	Do you see something about the releases?  It's a drop down menu
2010-06-01T08:38:00.000Z	Izinucs	edbian	been there and it's set for LTS releases.. if I set it for incremental releases it prompts me that an upgrade to 8.10 is available..
2010-06-01T08:38:00.000Z	edbian	Izinucs	But it isn't suggesting 10.04??
2010-06-01T08:38:00.000Z	Izinucs	edbian	nope
2010-06-01T08:39:00.000Z	Izinucs	edbian	it did this on another machine as well.
2010-06-01T08:39:00.000Z	edbian	Izinucs	Then that's all I got for ya!  Sorry, that's odd.
2010-06-01T08:39:00.000Z	edbian	Izinucs	Have you seen it act correctly?
2010-06-01T08:39:00.000Z	Izinucs	edbian	what do you mean "act correctly"?  ..
2010-06-01T08:40:00.000Z	edbian	Izinucs	Have you seen an ubuntu 8.04 system upgrade straight to 10.04 ??
2010-06-01T08:40:00.000Z	edbian	Izinucs	I admit that I thought you could but maybe you simply can't?
2010-06-01T08:40:00.000Z	Izinucs	edbian	you're suppose to be able to go from one LTS to the next with no issue..
2010-06-01T08:40:00.000Z	edbian	Izinucs	I thought so too
2010-06-16T07:50:00.000Z	edbian	Izinucs	That is usually enabled by default.  Is the client machine linux?  Or just the server?
2010-06-16T07:50:00.000Z	Izinucs	edbian	both are desktop machines
2010-06-16T07:52:00.000Z	edbian	Izinucs	server: the machine you're connecting to.  It is an ssh server.  client: the machine you're sitting at connecting to the server from.  Get it?  ARe they both linux?
2010-06-16T07:52:00.000Z	Izinucs	edbian	yes.. kubuntu and ubuntu.. client (local) is Ubuntu 10.04 and server is kubuntu 10.04
