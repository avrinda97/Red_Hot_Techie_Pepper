2008-04-29T10:21:00.000Z	Mike2008999		hello... can anyone teach me on how to install theme in ibuntu??
2008-04-29T10:22:00.000Z	brent113	Mike2008999	System->Preferences->Appearance->Install
2008-04-29T10:23:00.000Z	brent113	Mike2008999	in the lower right there is a button labeled Install...
2008-04-29T10:24:00.000Z	brent113	Mike2008999	it's in the Theme tab
2008-04-29T10:24:00.000Z	brent113	Mike2008999	one second, I'll send you a screenshot, ok?
2008-04-29T10:25:00.000Z	brent113	Mike2008999	I just pmd you
2008-04-29T10:30:00.000Z	brent113	Mike2008999	does that explain it?
2008-04-29T10:32:00.000Z	brent113	Mike2008999	take a look at gnome-lok.org
2008-04-29T10:33:00.000Z	brent113	Mike2008999	 the default window manager is metacity, so look at metcaity themes
2008-04-29T10:34:00.000Z	brent113	Mike2008999	metacity*
2008-04-29T10:36:00.000Z	brent113	Mike2008999	it's the 5th option down on the left menu
2008-04-29T10:49:00.000Z	brent113	Mike2008999	go back into appearance, go to the last tab, and choose the bottom option
2008-04-29T10:50:00.000Z	brent113	Mike2008999	go back into appearance, go to the last tab, and choose the bottom option
2008-04-29T10:51:00.000Z	brent113	Mike2008999	nice capslock.  If you did that, compiz will be enabled, just hit OK.  If you want further config install ccsm, the Compiz Advanced Settings Manager
2008-04-29T10:53:00.000Z	brent113	Mike2008999	you'll need ccsm, as I said earlier
2008-04-29T10:54:00.000Z	brent113	Mike2008999	no
2008-04-29T10:56:00.000Z	brent113	Mike2008999	sudo apt-get install compiz-config-settings-manager
2008-04-29T10:57:00.000Z	brent113	Mike2008999	then you can run it from system->preferences->Advanced Desktop Effects Settings
2008-04-29T11:05:00.000Z	brent113	Mike2008999	for future reference, you can type part of a name in and then use tab for autocomplete, or press tab twice to see all your options
