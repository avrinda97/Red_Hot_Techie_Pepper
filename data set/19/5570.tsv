2008-12-10T14:42:00.000Z	ocs		nothing else
2008-12-10T14:43:00.000Z	ocs		I don't need explanations on how to install printers
2008-12-10T14:43:00.000Z	ne2k__	ocs	I don't understand what you mean by the "page" for configuring printers and a "link" to it. printers in ubuntu are configured with an application. nobody can give you a link to that
2008-12-10T14:44:00.000Z	ocs	ne2k__	somebody did. and it worked perfectly.
2008-12-10T14:45:00.000Z	ne2k__	ocs	what makes you think that you can configure your printers through a local web interface?
2008-12-10T14:45:00.000Z	ocs	ne2k__	i 've already done that
2008-12-10T14:45:00.000Z	ne2k__	ocs	you've already done what?
2008-12-10T14:46:00.000Z	ocs	ne2k__	if you don't know or don't understand what I'm talking about, it's unuseful to make observations
2008-12-10T14:46:00.000Z	ne2k__	ocs	well you haven't what makes you think you can configure your printer through a web interface. why would you be able to do that?
2008-12-10T14:46:00.000Z	ocs	ne2k__	i HAVE IT. i don't remember the url.
2008-12-10T14:47:00.000Z	ne2k__	ocs	you have what?
2008-12-10T14:47:00.000Z	ne2k__	ocs	what is IT?!
2008-12-10T14:47:00.000Z	ocs	ne2k__	ok, you are getting boring
2008-12-10T14:50:00.000Z	ne2k__	ocs	oh look. a search for "cups web interface" reveals that as the first result
2008-12-10T14:50:00.000Z	ocs	ne2k__	now, you are ridiculous. You don't want to admit  your ignorance about the question
2008-12-10T14:51:00.000Z	ne2k__	ocs	I never knew that cups has a web interface. why would it?
2008-12-10T14:51:00.000Z	ne2k__	ocs	but, I still maintain that your question was crap
2008-12-10T14:51:00.000Z	ocs	ne2k__	ok, bye bye
