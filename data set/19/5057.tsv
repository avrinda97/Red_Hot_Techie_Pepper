2011-11-06T21:23:00.000Z	bekks	spot_	Wrong.
2011-11-06T21:23:00.000Z	bekks	spot_	Windows will overwrote everything it needs to repair its installation.
2011-11-06T21:24:00.000Z	bekks	spot_	dr_willis: The most easy way is to insert the windows cd and start the repair option. Everything else is a job for ##windows
2011-11-06T21:31:00.000Z	bekks	spot_	deleting linux will NOT delete grub and fix your windows. you have been told how to fix your windows.
2011-11-06T21:32:00.000Z	bekks	spot_	You have been told already.
2011-11-06T21:34:00.000Z	bekks	spot_	three people told you how to fix it.
2011-11-06T21:35:00.000Z	bekks	spot_	Did you insert a windows cd and chose the repair option?
2011-11-06T21:36:00.000Z	bekks	spot_	At that point, grub isnt involved at all.
2011-11-06T21:38:00.000Z	bekks	spot_	Because it isnt a grub or ubuntu problem.
