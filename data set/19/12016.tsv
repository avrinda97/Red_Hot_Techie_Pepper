2005-11-16T10:02:00.000Z	sproingie	Habbie	linux will use PAE for >4gigs on 32 bit.  it's a hack if you're writing apps for it, but most users wont notice
2005-11-16T10:04:00.000Z	Habbie	sproingie	the problem with PAE is that it chops 10% off your overall performance
2005-11-16T10:05:00.000Z	Habbie	sproingie	at that point the choice between 32bits/64bits OS becomes hard :)
2005-11-16T10:05:00.000Z	sproingie	Habbie	for servers there's no question, 64 bit is the way to go
2005-11-16T10:05:00.000Z	Habbie	sproingie	not always
2005-11-16T10:06:00.000Z	Habbie	sproingie	on -intel- CPUs, with less than 4 gigs of ram, 32bit is the way to go :)
2005-11-16T10:06:00.000Z	sproingie	Habbie	eh.  there's no performance difference.
2005-11-16T10:07:00.000Z	Habbie	sproingie	there is
2005-11-16T10:07:00.000Z	sproingie	Habbie	although i do also run xfs.  which is zoom zoom fast on a 64 bit distro.
2005-11-16T10:07:00.000Z	Habbie	sproingie	on amd64, that is. not on intel cpus :)
2005-11-16T10:07:00.000Z	Habbie	sproingie	yes, anything involving large numbers or numbers that can -become- large is faster on 64bits :)
2005-11-16T10:07:00.000Z	sproingie	Habbie	i just remembered that xfs is my main reason for sticking with 64 bit.  more stable than reiser, and boy it's fast
2005-11-16T10:07:00.000Z	Habbie	sproingie	there is never a good reason to use reiser
2005-11-16T10:08:00.000Z	Habbie	sproingie	and I love xfs; although I have never used xfs -with linux- :)
2005-11-16T10:08:00.000Z	sproingie	Habbie	reiser3 is certainly better than ext3 when you're dealing with millions of files (think maildir spools)
2005-11-16T10:08:00.000Z	Habbie	sproingie	yes, but; reiser is still a reliable way to lose all your data
2005-11-16T10:08:00.000Z	Habbie	sproingie	including reiser3
2005-11-16T10:09:00.000Z	sproingie	Habbie	reiser4 needs a few more years in the oven.  frankly so does reiser3, but it seems to do about as well as ext3
2005-11-16T10:09:00.000Z	sproingie	Habbie	i've experienced plenty of data loss with ext3
