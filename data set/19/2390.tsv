2012-09-20T01:22:00.000Z	allure		I need a powerful tool to convert HD videos to mp4... any tips? :)
2012-09-20T01:23:00.000Z	allure		I have 24G of RAM on a core i7 and would like to take advantage of it
2012-09-20T01:23:00.000Z	dr_willis	allure	 ffmpeg, mencoder, most gui front ends and tools can do that.
2012-09-20T01:23:00.000Z	dr_willis	allure	 be sure the multithread encoding features are enabled.
2012-09-20T01:23:00.000Z	allure	dr_willis	oh! Where do I check that?
2012-09-20T01:24:00.000Z	dr_willis	allure	 in the docs for whatever tool you are using. I noticed it one day in winff it was just using 1 core. I had to add a option to the cli settings
2012-09-20T01:24:00.000Z	allure	dr_willis	yeah, that is the reason I came here to ask... I am using WinFF and it is not fast at all. Maybe that's the reason! :)
2012-09-20T01:25:00.000Z	dr_willis	allure	 I  recall getting the exact info from the askubuntu forums I think on ffmpeg multithread or winff multithread options
2012-09-20T01:25:00.000Z	dr_willis	allure	 watch your cpu load. here it would 100% 1 core.
2012-09-20T01:25:00.000Z	dr_willis	allure	 of course your whold system will start lagging if you use too many threads
2012-09-20T01:26:00.000Z	allure	dr_willis	I thought there was some way to optimize the encoding proccess... my video files are all above 1G each and I have to encode 12 of them per day! :)
2012-09-20T01:27:00.000Z	dr_willis	allure	 from the winff docs (i just looked) it uses  '-threads 2'  if multithreading is enabled. you can set it to use moar..
2012-09-20T01:28:00.000Z	dr_willis	allure	 faster speeds  can result in worse quality.. so its a trade off. if you are using all your cores. ;)
2012-09-20T01:28:00.000Z	allure	dr_willis	yes, there is an option in the preferences to allow it to use multithreads. I hope it improves the speed, cause i need much much moar :)
2012-09-20T01:28:00.000Z	allure	dr_willis	thank you :)
2012-09-20T01:29:00.000Z	dr_willis	allure	 I think you want threads  one less then the # of cores.
2012-09-20T01:29:00.000Z	allure	dr_willis	I can dedicate the machine to encoding, so it's no biggy :)
2012-09-20T01:29:00.000Z	dr_willis	allure	 you may want to see what command line winff is using, and use it as a base to tweak your own set of alias's
2012-09-20T01:30:00.000Z	allure	dr_willis	yeah, cool idea :)
