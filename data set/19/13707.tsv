2005-02-08T07:15:00.000Z	Dreamer3		any former debian-sarge now ubuntu uses?
2005-02-08T07:16:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	Dreamer3	I'm formerly debian
2005-02-15T07:24:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	Dreamer3	allofmp3.com
2005-02-28T11:35:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	Dreamer3	isn't that the default?
2005-02-28T11:35:00.000Z	Dreamer3	HrdwrBoB	i mean like all the newer programs are doing, 3 vertical panes
2005-02-28T11:36:00.000Z	Dreamer3	HrdwrBoB	balsa, outlook 2003, thunderbird do it... it must be cool
2005-02-28T11:36:00.000Z	Dreamer3	HrdwrBoB	i just want to know if i can try it with evo or not
2005-04-09T12:17:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	Dreamer3	honestly, the BEST fix for that is to buy a usb kety
2005-04-09T12:18:00.000Z	Dreamer3	HrdwrBoB	she had a digital cam that uses a floppy
2005-04-09T12:18:00.000Z	Dreamer3	HrdwrBoB	not an acceptible answer when the floppy worked FINE 100% of the time in windows :)
2005-04-09T12:18:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	Dreamer3	in any case fam is replaced by gamin in hoary
2005-04-09T12:19:00.000Z	Dreamer3	HrdwrBoB	i'm all about telling someone "you've got a crappy winmodem who's manufacturer doesn't support linux" but "your floppy isn't linux compatible" is a bit much :)
2005-04-09T12:19:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	Dreamer3	floppies are ancient technology
2005-04-09T12:19:00.000Z	Dreamer3	HrdwrBoB	yes, i know :)
2005-04-09T12:19:00.000Z	Dreamer3	HrdwrBoB	but not for my mom
2005-04-09T12:19:00.000Z	Dreamer3	HrdwrBoB	if one quits working, she gets another, she paid a LOT for her camera (many moons ago)
2005-04-09T12:20:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	Dreamer3	upgrade to hoary, gamin will fix it
2005-04-09T12:20:00.000Z	Dreamer3	HrdwrBoB	i'll try that after hoary comes out if it works aok on my laptop :)
2005-04-09T12:20:00.000Z	Dreamer3	HrdwrBoB	thoguh i'm not sure it'll fix the mounting problem, but for not i added vfat as the filesystem type in /etc/fstab, so that seems to fix the broken auto-detection
