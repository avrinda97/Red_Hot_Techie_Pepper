2008-09-14T14:51:00.000Z	ikonia	bdln	I just asked for ls -la on dns2go
2008-09-14T14:52:00.000Z	ikonia	bdln	ls: cannot access dns2go: No such file or directory
2008-09-14T14:52:00.000Z	ikonia	bdln	is that the error
2008-09-14T14:52:00.000Z	ikonia	bdln	so your not in /usr/local/bin then
2008-09-14T14:53:00.000Z	ikonia	bdln	no it doesn't you said it says "not found"

2008-09-14T14:56:00.000Z	ikonia	bdln	/usr/local/bin/dns2go
2008-09-14T14:57:00.000Z	ikonia	bdln	I'm asking you to do "/usr/local/bin/dns2go"
2008-09-14T14:57:00.000Z	ikonia	bdln	doesn't matter where
2008-09-14T14:58:00.000Z	ikonia	bdln	so a dependency it wants isn't ther
2008-09-14T14:59:00.000Z	ikonia	bdln	maybe not missing, but not in the right location
