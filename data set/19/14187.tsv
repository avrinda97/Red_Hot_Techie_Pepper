2004-10-25T10:33:00.000Z	milkman638		okay well to be honest I've already tried setting up the wireless card and it exists in my interfaces file, but iwconfig won't work on it
2004-10-25T10:33:00.000Z	bborkk	milkman638	What happens?
2004-10-25T10:35:00.000Z	milkman638	bborkk	iwconfig up wlan0 returns " Error: unrecognized wireless request"
2004-10-25T10:35:00.000Z	bborkk	milkman638	Did you try "sudo ifup wlan0"?
2004-10-25T10:35:00.000Z	milkman638	bborkk	ifconfig up wlan0 returns "wlan0: Unknown host"
2004-10-25T10:36:00.000Z	bborkk	milkman638	Type: "cat /etc/network/interfaces"
2004-10-25T10:37:00.000Z	bborkk	milkman638	What comes up?
2004-10-25T10:37:00.000Z	bborkk		Leave it alone... it's busy.
2004-10-25T10:38:00.000Z	bborkk		Eh.
2004-10-25T10:38:00.000Z	milkman638	bborkk	it returns info on the file and the loopback device and my lan connection (eth0)
2004-10-25T10:38:00.000Z	bborkk	milkman638	Okay, then your wireless device isn't listed, right?
2004-10-25T10:39:00.000Z	milkman638	bborkk	correct
2004-10-25T10:39:00.000Z	bborkk	milkman638	Okay, go to Computer -> System Configuration -> Networking
2004-10-25T10:41:00.000Z	milkman638	bborkk	wow, that was easy
2004-10-25T10:41:00.000Z	milkman638	bborkk	either your a genius or I'm a complete idiot
2004-10-25T10:42:00.000Z	bborkk	milkman638	No comment.  :)
2004-10-25T10:42:00.000Z	milkman638		I'm leaning towards the latter
2004-10-25T10:42:00.000Z	bborkk	milkman638	Your wireless device should show up in the interfaces file now.  
2004-10-25T10:43:00.000Z	bborkk	milkman638	sudo ifup wlan0 should also work now.  Of course, you can also try it from the GUI dialog you were just in, but that doesn't always work for me.
