2008-05-30T01:11:00.000Z	lolzer	pen	6 or 1/2 dozen of the other. they are both good.
2008-05-30T01:13:00.000Z	pen	lolzer	no best, but there is a difference between usability
2008-05-30T01:13:00.000Z	pen	lolzer	I'm talking about the controls
2008-05-30T01:13:00.000Z	pen	lolzer	interface
2008-05-30T01:13:00.000Z	lolzer	pen	see !best
2008-05-30T01:13:00.000Z	pen	lolzer	you are not answering my question. You are just giving away junks
2008-05-30T01:13:00.000Z	pen	lolzer	it's not a  "best" app question
2008-05-30T01:14:00.000Z	pen	lolzer	if an app has better control over the other, then it's not comparing it's justifying
2008-05-30T01:14:00.000Z	pen	lolzer	who would still use the crappy win3.1 if winxp has everything and everything superior
2008-05-30T01:15:00.000Z	pen	lolzer	but I have never used vlc, so I'm here just asking for reviews
2008-05-30T01:15:00.000Z	lolzer	pen	they both play the media files with equal ability.
2008-05-30T01:15:00.000Z	pen	lolzer	you sure? both can handle the stream effectively? both control works as equally?
2008-05-30T01:16:00.000Z	lolzer	pen	software interface preferences are a personal choice and come down to personal taste.
2008-05-30T01:17:00.000Z	lolzer	pen	this is my suggestion. install both and decide which one you like best.
