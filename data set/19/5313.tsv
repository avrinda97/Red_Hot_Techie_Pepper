2008-07-29T14:11:00.000Z	jc-denton		so i don't want to hear this
2008-07-29T14:12:00.000Z	jc-denton		so how does the network manager "talk" to the wlan driver?
2008-07-29T14:13:00.000Z	jc-denton		:)
2008-07-29T14:14:00.000Z	jc-denton		aha
2008-07-29T14:14:00.000Z	ManualOverDozer8	jc-denton	i found an application much better than Network Manager
2008-07-29T14:14:00.000Z	jc-denton	ManualOverDozer8	?!
2008-07-29T14:14:00.000Z	jc-denton		loook
2008-07-29T14:14:00.000Z	jc-denton		ubuntu and kubntu both ship network manager
2008-07-29T14:14:00.000Z	jc-denton		it normally works
2008-07-29T14:15:00.000Z	ManualOverDozer8		﻿ jc-denton WicD
2008-07-29T14:15:00.000Z	jc-denton		but now it does not for xome strange reason
2008-07-29T14:15:00.000Z	ManualOverDozer8		normally is right but not always
2008-07-29T14:15:00.000Z	ManualOverDozer8		remove NetMan and install WicD, you will find wireless is much more fluent to configure
2008-07-29T14:15:00.000Z	jc-denton	ManualOverDozer8	i don't want anything different
2008-07-29T14:15:00.000Z	jc-denton		is it just another frontend to network manager/
2008-07-29T14:15:00.000Z	ManualOverDozer8		﻿ jc-denton then you dont want ease of use
2008-07-29T14:16:00.000Z	jc-denton		so how does nm talk to the driver?
2008-07-29T14:16:00.000Z	jc-denton	ManualOverDozer8	no it should work out of the box
