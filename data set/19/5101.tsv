2009-02-02T08:22:00.000Z	koshar2	mjc	wider address bus actually
2009-02-02T08:23:00.000Z	mjc	koshar2	there are more registers as well
2009-02-02T08:23:00.000Z	mjc	koshar2	that is what provides the general code speedup
2009-02-02T08:25:00.000Z	koshar2	mjc	it can only execute code jsut as fast however , there will still likely only be <256 op codes
2009-02-02T08:25:00.000Z	mjc	koshar2	it can only execute 32bit code as fast as 32bit OSes can, but due to extra registers most code will be faster if simply recompiled
2009-02-02T08:26:00.000Z	koshar2	mjc	only real benifit is being able to move bigger words in singe executions
2009-02-02T08:26:00.000Z	koshar2	mjc	oh and the obvious fact that there is more mapable ram
2009-02-02T08:27:00.000Z	mjc	koshar2	dude no, there are 16 GP registers in x86-64 and 8 in x86-32
2009-02-02T08:27:00.000Z	mjc	koshar2	they are also wider
2009-02-02T08:27:00.000Z	mjc	koshar2	there are also twice as many SSE regs
2009-02-02T08:27:00.000Z	mjc	koshar2	doubling the amount of GP regisers is huge
2009-02-02T08:28:00.000Z	koshar2	mjc	the extra registers will be a product of dual core and hypervisor functions
2009-02-02T08:28:00.000Z	mjc	koshar2	no, they are general purpose
2009-02-02T08:28:00.000Z	koshar2	mjc	you can still only have one parity flag, one equil to flag ect...
2009-02-02T08:30:00.000Z	mjc	koshar2	http://developer.amd.com/SiteCollectionImages/Articles/7662.gif
2009-02-02T08:31:00.000Z	koshar2	mjc	ahh i see the r8 to r 16 registers,
2009-02-02T08:32:00.000Z	mjc	koshar2	yes, that alone is a HUGE benefit for all aps
2009-02-02T08:33:00.000Z	koshar2	mjc	i still think data troughput on the 64 bit address bus is the greatest advance with 64bit.
2009-02-02T08:33:00.000Z	mjc	koshar2	it is, but it doesn't make as big of a difference for most uses
