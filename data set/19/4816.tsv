2008-11-03T07:15:00.000Z	Rubin	jj_galvez	that looks quite nasty. are you out of disk space or something?
2008-11-03T07:16:00.000Z	jj_galvez	Rubin	Nope I've got tuns of space
2008-11-03T07:16:00.000Z	Rubin	jj_galvez	 unable to create `./usr/lib32/libGL.so.1.2': No such file or directory <-- seems to be the key error
2008-11-03T07:16:00.000Z	Rubin	jj_galvez	is that a 64bit install?
2008-11-03T07:16:00.000Z	jj_galvez	Rubin	yes its 64bit
2008-11-03T07:17:00.000Z	Rubin	jj_galvez	do you have a /usr/lib32/ directory?
2008-11-03T07:17:00.000Z	jj_galvez	Rubin	yes that folder is present
2008-11-03T07:18:00.000Z	Rubin	jj_galvez	maybe a corrupt copy? try apt-get clean; then apt-get install ia32-libs again (sudo both)
2008-11-03T07:18:00.000Z	jj_galvez	Rubin	I thought of that at first too, did that a couple of time already no good same error, even downloaded the deb from several different locations with the same results
2008-11-03T07:19:00.000Z	Rubin	jj_galvez	try this: sudo touch /usr/lib32/test
2008-11-03T07:19:00.000Z	jj_galvez	Rubin	did that no errors
2008-11-03T07:20:00.000Z	Rubin	jj_galvez	huh. you do anything weird to anything? like /etc/apt/* ?
2008-11-03T07:21:00.000Z	jj_galvez	Rubin	I've not done anything odd, and other packages have installed without issues, did you want to see the contnets of /etc/apt/?
2008-11-03T07:22:00.000Z	Rubin	jj_galvez	nah. you may require help from someone more skilled in the package system than I
2008-11-03T07:23:00.000Z	Rubin	jj_galvez	all i can tell you is that I installed that package on a 64bit system a couple days ago and it worked :)
2008-11-03T07:23:00.000Z	jj_galvez	Rubin	well thanks for trying, I'll keep asking hopefully someone will chime in
2008-11-03T07:24:00.000Z	jj_galvez	Rubin	do you know where dpkg unpacks stuff to during the install? is there a temp location where files go prior to being moved to their final location?
2008-11-03T07:24:00.000Z	Rubin	jj_galvez	i was thinking down the same path, but I don't know, and I havnt been able to figure it out
2008-11-03T07:25:00.000Z	Rubin	jj_galvez	/var/lib/dpkg myabe?
