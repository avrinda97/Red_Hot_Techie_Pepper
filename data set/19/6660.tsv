2008-01-01T13:03:00.000Z	churka		Can anyone help me with Ubuntu on VMWARE Player???
2008-01-01T13:03:00.000Z	churka		Anyone?
2008-01-01T13:03:00.000Z	churka		ANYONE?
2008-01-01T13:05:00.000Z	norv	churka	how far did you get? if you haven't even got bootup might want to ask on a vmware or a channel for your host system
2008-01-01T13:06:00.000Z	norv	churka	unless you mean Ubuntu is the host
2008-01-01T13:06:00.000Z	norv	churka	Hehe, doesn't work that way
2008-01-01T13:07:00.000Z	norv	churka	You would bridge or something, I am not an expert at that
2008-01-01T13:07:00.000Z	norv	churka	I use VirtualBox.. but you make it look like your wireless is wired
2008-01-01T13:08:00.000Z	norv	churka	yes, you connect via wireless in XP, and pass the network connection to VMware.
2008-01-01T13:08:00.000Z	norv	churka	not sure /how/, I don't use vmware. Bridge sounds like the right one
2008-01-01T13:09:00.000Z	norv	churka	that's the opposite setup, but it's not that different
2008-01-01T13:10:00.000Z	norv	churka	you are running ubuntu under vmware. Onyx is running xp under vmware
2008-01-01T13:13:00.000Z	norv	churka	not sure, it works fine for what I do and makes me load less modules
2008-01-01T13:15:00.000Z	churka	norv	Back to my wireless problem, do you know any other people that are familiar with VmWare?
2008-01-01T13:17:00.000Z	norv	churka	I'm not sure if it is better, you would have to try
