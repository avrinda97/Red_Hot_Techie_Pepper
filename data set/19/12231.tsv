2005-10-30T09:47:00.000Z	chris86wm		hey guys, i have a bunch of pictures that i want to set to cycle as my screensaver. can i do that in ubuntu?
2005-10-30T09:48:00.000Z	chris86wm		lol i cant find the option to do it
2005-10-30T09:48:00.000Z	chris86wm		i assume its in the screensaver preferences window
2005-10-30T09:48:00.000Z	chris86wm		yeah
2005-10-30T09:48:00.000Z	chris86wm		im there
2005-10-30T09:48:00.000Z	chris86wm		yeah
2005-10-30T09:50:00.000Z	chris86wm		well see, i dont want to cycle through screensavers. just some pictures that i took
2005-10-30T09:50:00.000Z	chris86wm		would it be this "image manipulation" thing?
2005-10-30T09:51:00.000Z	chris86wm		hmm
2005-10-30T09:52:00.000Z	chris86wm		you think it would be in the screensavers list
2005-10-30T09:53:00.000Z	dooglus	chris86wm	wouldn't you!  I'm trying to find it too
2005-10-30T09:53:00.000Z	dooglus	chris86wm	perhaps 'xlockmore' has something?
2005-10-30T10:00:00.000Z	dooglus	chris86wm	I can't find anything.  That's really quite strange.  Why no 'image' screensaver?
2005-10-30T10:02:00.000Z	chris86wm	dooglus	from what i am reading, i think there is one in kde
2005-10-30T10:03:00.000Z	dooglus	chris86wm	I remember something in KDE, yes.
2005-10-30T10:04:00.000Z	chris86wm	dooglus	ah found it!!!!
2005-10-30T10:05:00.000Z	chris86wm	dooglus	its called GLSlideshow
2005-10-30T10:05:00.000Z	dooglus	chris86wm	that's a screensaver?
2005-10-30T10:05:00.000Z	chris86wm	dooglus	yes, it is in the list
