2004-11-10T07:33:00.000Z	ahood		Okay, I have searched the ubuntu forums and wiki for more information on editing the menu.lst file. However, I don't see an example of the exact change that will enable dual booting with WinXP (I am a linux noobie and in case I have this problem). Can anyone suggest where I can look for the exact change to make in menu.lst?
2004-11-10T07:34:00.000Z	stvn	ahood	you know which partition windows is located?
2004-11-10T07:34:00.000Z	ahood	stvn	yes, hda1
2004-11-10T07:35:00.000Z	stvn	ahood	normally, uncommenting the example in menu.lst should work
2004-11-10T07:36:00.000Z	stvn	ahood	hda1 == (hd0,0)
2004-11-10T07:37:00.000Z	ahood	stvn	visor: Thanks for the replies. I have not actually installed Ubuntu, but rather, I am trying to anticipate a possible problem I might encounter based on info I got from the Ubuntu forums.
2004-11-10T07:42:00.000Z	stvn	ahood	ubuntu will install ubuntu just fine, so you can always use ubuntu if cp doesn't work anymore :P
2004-11-10T07:43:00.000Z	stvn	ahood	most of the time it works straight out of the box, but sometimes it doesn't and uncommenting works, and in a rare case that doesn't work either and you've to dive deeper to solve it
2004-11-10T07:47:00.000Z	ahood	stvn	Thanks!
2004-11-10T07:47:00.000Z	stvn	ahood	NP
2004-11-10T07:49:00.000Z	stvn	ahood	it will replace lilo with grub, AFAIK there's no choice offered
2004-11-10T07:49:00.000Z	ahood	stvn	Will the replacement prevent me from booting into Xandros?
2004-11-10T07:50:00.000Z	stvn	ahood	probably not, it will recognise it - at least it recognised my installed dfebian system and offered me to boot to it
2004-11-10T07:55:00.000Z	stvn	ahood	dunno, never met anyone who wanted to uninstallit ;) - but yes i think so
2004-11-10T07:57:00.000Z	ahood	stvn	HEHE! If I erase the mbr, is there a way to restore lilo to boot into Xandros?
2004-11-10T07:57:00.000Z	stvn	ahood	best way is to use xandros rescue/install disc
2004-11-10T07:58:00.000Z	ahood	stvn	That makes sense. I do believe Xandros installation CD should restore the lilo bootloader, now that you mention it. Thanks!
2004-11-10T08:02:00.000Z	stvn	ahood	dunno, don't have the livecd
2004-11-10T08:03:00.000Z	ahood	stvn	I will try it and if so, I will post a forum message thanking the developers for fixing this.
