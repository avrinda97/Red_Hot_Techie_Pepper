2010-09-27T10:18:00.000Z	bonez2046		anyone have success running skype for linux, with video? is skype+linux+video there yet?
2010-09-27T10:19:00.000Z	lucent	bonez2046	I regularly video call with Skype
2010-09-27T10:19:00.000Z	lucent	bonez2046	the Linux client is a bit janky, but that's more about some of my contacts can't search for me when I'm logged in. Most functions work
2010-09-27T10:21:00.000Z	bonez2046	lucent	which version of skype? maybe my issue is setting up my cam
2010-09-27T10:22:00.000Z	lucent	bonez2046	I've managed to install Skype (Beta) Version 2.1.0.81, which version is yours?
2010-09-27T10:22:00.000Z	bonez2046	lucent	I have that same version 2.1.0.81
2010-09-27T10:24:00.000Z	lucent	bonez2046	um, privmsg w/ me we can talk about Skype, it's just a tad off topic here
2010-11-17T11:32:00.000Z	lucent	bonez2046	ah, you could.  The LJ IIIP is a nice old printer for sure ;)
2010-11-17T11:32:00.000Z	lucent	bonez2046	aren't your rubber rollers worn out and cracked yet though?
2010-11-17T11:32:00.000Z	bonez2046	lucent	we bought this one damned near 20 years ago .. still works great.. have repaired a few things on it
2010-11-17T11:32:00.000Z	bonez2046	lucent	I have replaced the clutch, the laser, and the rollers.. I think the top rollers are due for replacement
2010-11-17T11:33:00.000Z	bonez2046	lucent	yeah.. I am installing 10.10 on an older deskpro.. hoping to plug this printer as well as a scanner into this box.. to act as my print and scan server
2010-11-17T11:34:00.000Z	lucent	bonez2046	usb-parallel adapter on your desktop machine might be more efficient
2010-11-17T11:35:00.000Z	bonez2046	lucent	I know I could buy a box from HP et al, that would give the printer an IP.. but this box is just sitting around..
2010-11-17T11:35:00.000Z	bonez2046	lucent	usb-parallel? is that a hardware device?
2010-11-17T11:35:00.000Z	lucent	bonez2046	yeah it's parallel port on one side, and usb on the other, so you can plug old stuff into USB capable computer
2010-11-17T11:36:00.000Z	bonez2046	lucent	well, my wife and boys print to this printer.. on home LAN.. so I need to have it on.. but I guess they COULD send their jobs to it and then come down and switch the printer on
2010-11-17T11:37:00.000Z	lucent	bonez2046	lights dim when you turn it on? ;)
2010-11-17T11:37:00.000Z	bonez2046	lucent	no, they are fine..
