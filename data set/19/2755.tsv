2011-12-18T00:14:00.000Z	skegeek		I'd like some help configuring Ubuntu for my external LCD. I have a Toshiba Satellite A205(15.4" WXVGA), Ubuntu 11.10, with a KOGi 17"-19" LCD Flat Screen.
2011-12-18T00:15:00.000Z	skegeek		Ubuntu currently allows only up to 1024x768, however this LCD has proven it can do 1280x1024.
2011-12-18T00:15:00.000Z	skegeek		I believe Ubuntu has ARandR...
2011-12-18T00:17:00.000Z	skegeek		All output including "Newmode"?
2011-12-18T00:17:00.000Z	paulsomebody	skegeek	I have just happily dealt with the similar problem, let me share a link. :)
2011-12-18T00:18:00.000Z	paulsomebody	skegeek	Assuming, that you want to add an undetected resolution, you can find the complete instructions here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Config/Resolution#Adding_undetected_resolutions
2011-12-18T00:28:00.000Z	paulsomebody	skegeek	What are you trying to accomplish, anyway? Add a resolution that is not automatically detected?
2011-12-18T00:29:00.000Z	paulsomebody	skegeek	Is your driver Nvidia?
2011-12-18T00:32:00.000Z	paulsomebody	skegeek	If your driver is Nvidia, you simply can use it's utility, called «Nvidia X Server Settings» to change the resolution and write the changes to the configuration files.
2011-12-18T00:50:00.000Z	paulsomebody	skegeek	It means that you have an integrated video card.
2011-12-18T00:50:00.000Z	paulsomebody	skegeek	You will have to use xrandr, then.
2011-12-18T00:51:00.000Z	paulsomebody	skegeek	I think I have already given you the link to the page with instructions, no? This one. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Config/Resolution#Adding_undetected_resolutions
2011-12-18T01:42:00.000Z	paulsomebody	skegeek	Have you used xrandr?
2011-12-18T01:43:00.000Z	paulsomebody	skegeek	I don't think I understand you.
2011-12-18T01:43:00.000Z	paulsomebody	skegeek	You was able to scroll 'the desktop itself'?
2011-12-18T01:45:00.000Z	paulsomebody	skegeek	Then I do not quite understand the issue. Was the image stretched, or disproportionate?
2011-12-18T01:46:00.000Z	paulsomebody	skegeek	It is okay.
2011-12-18T01:47:00.000Z	paulsomebody	skegeek	You should not have been able to do it, unless something is wrong, or you deliberately set up the virtual resolution bigger than than the real.
2011-12-18T01:47:00.000Z	paulsomebody	skegeek	Do you know for a fact, that your display can do 1280×1024?
