2011-06-29T13:53:00.000Z	robeph		grub,   how does ubuntus handle grub.conf
2011-06-29T13:53:00.000Z	robeph		or does it use menu.lst
2011-06-29T13:53:00.000Z	robeph		and is it stored (normally) in /boot/grub  or in /boot/
2011-06-29T13:54:00.000Z	llutz	robeph	theres /etc/default/grub and /etc/grub.d/* to change
2011-06-29T13:54:00.000Z	robeph		this isn't related to ubuntu
2011-06-29T13:54:00.000Z	robeph		just ubuntu livecd

2011-06-29T13:55:00.000Z	robeph		what about grub.conf?
2011-06-29T13:55:00.000Z	llutz	robeph	you might manually change /boot/grub/grub.cfg , but those changes will be overwritten when calling "update-grub"
2011-06-29T13:55:00.000Z	robeph	llutz	this is temporary
