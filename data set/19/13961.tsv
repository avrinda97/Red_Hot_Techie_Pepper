2004-12-02T06:28:00.000Z	Nivlem		Anyone know why I would have system sounds, but nothing comes out when I insert a music cd and it starts to play?
2004-12-02T06:29:00.000Z	Nivlem		That is impossible....this is a macintosh..not a PC
2004-12-02T06:29:00.000Z	socomm	Nivlem	Macs are PC's ....
2004-12-02T06:30:00.000Z	Nivlem	socomm	It is generally understood that when one refers to "PC" that is is intel i386 architecture..
2004-12-05T16:40:00.000Z	socomm	Nivlem	k3b, assuming you don't mind qt.
2004-12-05T16:42:00.000Z	Nivlem	socomm	so it will run without needing a bunch of KDE libs?
2004-12-05T16:42:00.000Z	socomm	Nivlem	no, K3B == HEAVY KDE app.
2004-12-05T16:43:00.000Z	Nivlem	socomm	Ok...synaptic should add the dependencies no?
2004-12-05T16:43:00.000Z	socomm	Nivlem	correct.
2004-12-05T16:43:00.000Z	Nivlem	socomm	Great..thanks
2004-12-05T16:44:00.000Z	socomm	Nivlem	good luck.
2004-12-14T16:12:00.000Z	Nivlem	socomm	How are things?
2004-12-14T16:12:00.000Z	socomm	Nivlem	Fine, and you?
2004-12-14T16:13:00.000Z	Nivlem	socomm	Great...took me a couple days...finally figured out my prob with the firewire drive only mounting read-only....
2004-12-14T16:18:00.000Z	Nivlem	socomm	There is a Sun binary..but it is packaged for i386..so it bombs...
2004-12-14T16:19:00.000Z	socomm	Nivlem	Yes I doubt there are any Mac binaries for Linux. There maybe for Mac OS X.
2004-12-14T16:23:00.000Z	Nivlem	socomm	no xvidtune?
2004-12-14T16:24:00.000Z	Nivlem	socomm	Nevermind found it..
2004-12-14T16:24:00.000Z	socomm	Nivlem	I've never used xvidtune, xrandr is real easy to use.
