2010-11-26T01:38:00.000Z	nimbiotics		Hello evry1, I've got samba nstalled. Im trying to follow a step by step guide but there is something wrong here: Once I start the Samba Server Configuration, I get warning message stating that it couldn't understand some of the lines at smb.conf. Nevertheless I can add the (ubuntu) shared folder. When I go to Nautilius to see the folder's properties its NOT shared, and if I go back to open...
2010-11-26T01:38:00.000Z	nimbiotics		...Samba Server Configuration, I get warning again and the shared folder is NOT listed. Any and all ideas are appreciated. TIA!
2010-11-26T01:40:00.000Z	Volvo	nimbiotics	What application gives you that error ?
2010-11-26T01:41:00.000Z	Volvo	nimbiotics	I use GAdmin-SAMBA
2010-11-26T01:43:00.000Z	Volvo	nimbiotics	Schwish, Schwish, Swooosch! Nemas Problemas.
2010-11-26T01:44:00.000Z	nimbiotics	Volvo	GAdmin-SAMBA is installed I just dont know where iuts at :/
2010-11-26T01:44:00.000Z	Volvo	nimbiotics	Server tools
2010-11-26T01:45:00.000Z	nimbiotics	Volvo	running ... lets see what happens
2010-11-26T02:02:00.000Z	nimbiotics	Volvo	I used GADMIN-SAMBA, added the shares, added the 2 pCs, but again, when I go back to nautilus, the folder is NOT shared. Also, none of the PCs see the other one. Do I have to restart my ubuntu machine? TIA
2010-11-26T02:03:00.000Z	nimbiotics	Volvo	also, the information line in GADMIN-SAMBA says: "Status: Activated, inactive servers: nmbd"
2010-11-26T02:05:00.000Z	Volvo	nimbiotics	The name server, NMBD must be running in order for the other computers to query and see it or for it to assemble browselists. Try to start NMBD manually "sudo su" "nmbd -D"
2010-11-26T02:06:00.000Z	Volvo	nimbiotics	See to it that the server settings are as your network looks like "ifconfig"
2010-11-26T02:08:00.000Z	nimbiotics	Volvo	"sudo su nmbd -D" returned 'D' as an invalid option
2010-11-26T02:09:00.000Z	nimbiotics	Volvo	is "nmbd" the same as server host name?
2010-11-26T02:10:00.000Z	Volvo	nimbiotics	No, thats just a command to start the nmbd server
2010-11-26T02:12:00.000Z	Volvo	nimbiotics	It can exit without telling why because the allowed hosts and networks etc ipaddresses are wrongly configured.
2010-11-26T02:13:00.000Z	nimbiotics	Volvo	is there any way i could reset everything?
2010-11-26T02:13:00.000Z	Volvo	nimbiotics	remove samba conf, restart the program.
2010-11-26T02:14:00.000Z	Volvo	nimbiotics	Should not be required but there are thousands of settings so maybe that can help.
