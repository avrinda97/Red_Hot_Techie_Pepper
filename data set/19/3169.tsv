2009-10-12T05:52:00.000Z	vistanoload	angelus	ok, i'll try editing that in grub (replace right?)
2009-10-12T05:54:00.000Z	angelus	vistanoload	is your vista partition only ~13 GBs  ???
2009-10-12T05:54:00.000Z	vistanoload	angelus	no, 100 GB
2009-10-12T05:55:00.000Z	vistanoload	angelus	maybe 13 gb full
2009-10-12T05:58:00.000Z	angelus	vistanoload	imo that is why its not booting .... when it was being partitioned Vista lost some importatnt files .... and thus isnt loading ...
2009-10-12T05:59:00.000Z	vistanoload	angelus	no, i shrank the vista partition before installing ubuntu with ubuntu live (gparted)
2009-10-12T05:59:00.000Z	vistanoload	angelus	there were no errors reported in the logs
2009-10-12T06:05:00.000Z	vistanoload	angelus	you have any other ideas?
2009-10-12T06:06:00.000Z	angelus		before you installed Ubuntu .... your Vista partition was much larger i assume ????
2009-10-12T06:06:00.000Z	vistanoload		yes, 500 GB, but only had 13 GB filled
2009-10-12T06:07:00.000Z	angelus		Vistanoload .... im pretty sure that its cause Vista is corrupted .... do you have a Vista disk ...
2009-10-12T06:08:00.000Z	angelus	vistanoload	cause what you can do is repair your Vista, then i can show you how to get your GRUB back ... xD ...
2009-10-12T06:08:00.000Z	vistanoload	angelus	no, but there were no errors in ubuntu 9.04 gparted when resizing
2009-10-12T06:10:00.000Z	angelus	vistanoload	gparted doesnt check to see whether the file is a system file or not before removing it, if removal is necesary ..... it happenned to me .... i attempted to make my Vista partition as small as possible and some of my files got destroyed .... .
2009-10-12T06:14:00.000Z	vistanoload	angelus	i will download a vista cd from msdn, be right back
