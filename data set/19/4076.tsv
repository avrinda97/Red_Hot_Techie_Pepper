2009-03-30T04:59:00.000Z	Iceman_B^Ltop		this is annoying, Im getting random timeout when I SSH to my server from within the local network
2009-03-30T04:59:00.000Z	Iceman_B^Ltop		I didnt have them before with the Desktop version, im using the server version now
2009-03-30T04:59:00.000Z	genericname24350	Iceman_B^Ltop	Make sure you don't have your server configured to automatically boot you off after a certain amount of time
2009-03-30T05:00:00.000Z	Iceman_B^Ltop	genericname24350	that shouldnt be the case, the intervals are random
2009-03-30T05:00:00.000Z	genericname24350	Iceman_B^Ltop	Are you maintaining a constant connection?
2009-03-30T05:01:00.000Z	Iceman_B^Ltop	genericname24350	how do you mean?
2009-03-30T05:01:00.000Z	genericname24350	Iceman_B^Ltop	If you connection drops out, it close the connection?
2009-03-30T05:02:00.000Z	genericname24350	Iceman_B^Ltop	Oh. Well, that's possible I suppose.
2009-03-30T05:02:00.000Z	genericname24350	Iceman_B^Ltop	Strange. I'm not really sure why that happens.
2009-03-30T05:03:00.000Z	genericname24350	Iceman_B^Ltop	What's changed in your new configuration?
2009-03-30T05:04:00.000Z	genericname24350	Iceman_B^Ltop	Does it still drop when you're on the local network?
2009-03-30T05:05:00.000Z	genericname24350	Iceman_B^Ltop	Oh, ok. I thought maybe you meant over the internet or something. Probably a configuration somewhere.
2009-03-30T05:09:00.000Z	genericname24350	Iceman_B^Ltop	Can you ping the server?
2009-03-30T05:15:00.000Z	genericname24350	Iceman_B^Ltop	I agree. It's sounding like a network issue to me too.
2009-03-30T05:18:00.000Z	genericname24350	Iceman_B^Ltop	Have you forwarded the port on your router?
2009-03-30T05:19:00.000Z	Iceman_B^Ltop	genericname24350	that shouldnt be an issue, should it? It's on all on the LAN side
2009-03-30T05:19:00.000Z	genericname24350	Iceman_B^Ltop	Nope.
2009-03-30T05:20:00.000Z	genericname24350	Iceman_B^Ltop	Yeah.. I don't know. :P. Just looking for stuff to tinker with.
2009-03-30T05:20:00.000Z	genericname24350	Iceman_B^Ltop	I believe you need to configure iptables yourself.
