2006-12-08T15:48:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet		grrr .. one of my nfs shares allows r/w to all, and the other does not .. but they are written exactly the same in fstab and /etc/exports "other" than one is rw,users,noauto (so it isn't mounted at boot) and the other is defaults.. help?
2006-12-08T15:49:00.000Z	mdious	NineTeen67Comet	 could you take the users off and just specify a group of users...or an ip address/range instead?
2006-12-08T15:50:00.000Z	mdious	NineTeen67Comet	 I was reading a good article about nfs in linux user and developer...i could check that if you want?
2006-12-08T15:50:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet	mdious	the ip/range would be best I think .. like 192.168.0.* .. type?
2006-12-08T15:50:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet	mdious	my linux journals are at work .. grumble grumble ..
2006-12-08T15:51:00.000Z	mdious	NineTeen67Comet	 sure if that is what you are using...whatever you think is best I have no experience with it sorry
2006-12-08T15:51:00.000Z	mdious	NineTeen67Comet	 it's a good think they put the articles online hehe
2006-12-08T15:51:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet	mdious	Speakin' that, I should be able to get them all with my subscription now ..
2006-12-08T15:52:00.000Z	mdious	NineTeen67Comet	:) good luck with your nfs stuff, sorry i couldn't help
2006-12-08T15:52:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet	mdious	n/p .. I'm just stumped cuz it's always been so simple .. (compared to samba0 ..
2006-12-08T15:52:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet		samba
2006-12-08T15:53:00.000Z	mdious	NineTeen67Comet	 no experience with either, from what i read on nfs it seemed a lot simplier than samba but like i said....no experience :(
2006-12-08T15:54:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet		http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35967/ (client) http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35970/ (server) .. any ideas?
2006-12-08T15:54:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet	mdious	nfs is awesome for *nix networks.. one file on the server, and one adjustment in your fstab for the client and away you go .. unless it bugs out like mine is .. ;)
2006-12-08T15:55:00.000Z	mdious	NineTeen67Comet	 sounds good :)  Although I like with samba and ldap and stuff have you can have one directory that serves logons, shares etc for linux, unix, mac etc :)
2006-12-08T15:56:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet	mdious	true samba does allow for more OS connections .. wonder if mac can connect to nfs (I'm getting a mac next month) ..
2006-12-08T15:58:00.000Z	mdious	NineTeen67Comet	 very exciting, i grew up on macs...love them, recently got a nice g3 imac from my mums work...hopefully one day will get a mac laptop :)
2006-12-08T16:05:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet	mdious	I looked at the MacBook Pro a couple weeks ago while I was on leave .. after that it's sewn up .. when my student loan comes in .. I'm jumpin on the www to order me a new shiny apple .. lol
2006-12-08T16:06:00.000Z	mdious	NineTeen67Comet	 have fun with it
