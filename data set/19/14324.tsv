2011-01-16T00:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	eXpLoD	 depends on your needs
2011-01-16T01:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	eXpLoD	 kde has one,
2011-01-26T18:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	eXpLoD	 i recall googling one day and finding 2 free vpn services that worked with ubuntu.. i think i only had one working.. (just to play with) but ive not toyed with them in perhaps 7+ mo.
2011-01-26T18:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	eXpLoD	 you could shrink windows, then make a new partition in the newly freed space. and move /home/ or whatever you want to that. It all depends on your exact setup.
2011-01-26T18:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	eXpLoD	 Youy may want to pastebin the sudo fdisk -l, output and your current fstab file. For teh channel to see.
2011-01-26T18:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	eXpLoD	 spell the command correctly on the command line....
2011-01-27T21:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	eXpLoD	 i think its in the settings or a plugin for pidgin.
2011-01-27T21:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	eXpLoD	 i suggest using a dedicated irc client likd xchat, or weechat
2011-01-27T22:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	eXpLoD	 ask in #BSD ? :)
2011-01-27T22:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	eXpLoD	 commonly conky is started from a script with like a 10 sec 'delay' to let gnome get going and all setup. You may want to try that.
2011-01-27T22:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	eXpLoD	 conky faq also covers it.
2011-02-07T23:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	eXpLoD	 its not really an issue.. and you can get a cloke.. see '!cloak'
2011-02-27T15:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	eXpLoD	 any idea what you need to add? ive never uses scrot
2011-02-27T19:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	eXpLoD	 theres a scripts directory.  its documented in a few places. and i recall some extra python nautilus extensions that even give you a front end to the thing and some nice scripts
2011-02-27T19:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	eXpLoD	 i think at one time it was .nautilus/scripts but it may be mooved now
2011-02-27T19:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	eXpLoD	 add files to the proper dirs.
2011-02-27T19:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	eXpLoD	 learn how to fix it.. :)
2011-02-27T19:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	eXpLoD	 in the next reelase it really wont be much of an issue. the stuff will be very locked down.
