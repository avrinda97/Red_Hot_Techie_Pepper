2012-05-15T00:30:00.000Z	sirriffsalot		Hello! How do I check what specific  nvidia card I have? Google confuses me...
2012-05-15T00:30:00.000Z	Ben64	sirriffsalot	lspci | grep -i vga
2012-05-15T00:31:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	Ben64	cheers! Hang on
2012-05-15T00:32:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	Ben64	it seems I have two... :-S
2012-05-15T00:33:00.000Z	Ben64	sirriffsalot	you should look for something like this: 01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: nVidia Corporation G92 [GeForce GTS 250] (rev a2)
2012-05-15T00:33:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	Ben64	Yeah, I have two lines that go like that, haha!
2012-05-15T00:33:00.000Z	Ben64	sirriffsalot	what model does it say
2012-05-15T00:33:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	Ben64	 02:00.0 VGA compatible controller: NVIDIA Corporation C77 [GeForce 8200] (rev a2) 03:00.0 VGA compatible controller: NVIDIA Corporation G98 [GeForce G 100] (rev a1)
2012-05-15T00:34:00.000Z	Ben64	sirriffsalot	well thats strange, maybe you have an onboard card and a real card in the computer?
2012-05-15T00:35:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	Ben64	how would I check if that is so? I haven't added anything to this shitty computer... nvidia knows how to make life difficult though
2012-05-15T00:35:00.000Z	Ben64	sirriffsalot	look at the back of the computer, see how many VGA and/or DVI ports there are, and where they are located
2012-05-15T00:36:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	Ben64	well, there are two ports for connecting the screen, one at the top and one at the bottom
2012-05-15T00:36:00.000Z	Ben64	sirriffsalot	yeah, then you have two video cards
2012-05-15T00:37:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	Ben64	the reason I ask is because I am running virtualbox with a windows vista... and I can't get the right nvidia drivers done which I need... Any idea how I would go about getting it installed?
2012-05-15T00:37:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	Ben64	update manager hasn't done the trick so far...
2012-05-15T00:37:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	Ben64	IN vista;D
2012-05-15T00:37:00.000Z	Ben64	sirriffsalot	so ubuntu is the virtual one?
2012-05-15T00:38:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	Ben64	no, vista is :)
2012-05-15T00:43:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	Ben64	Is there a way of telling which of the two cards my screen is currently connected to then?:)
