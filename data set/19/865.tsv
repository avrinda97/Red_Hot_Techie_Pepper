2011-08-05T04:30:00.000Z	TonyFisher		Hello. I'm the guy who asked for the power management advice on my Ubuntu Netbook.
2011-08-05T04:30:00.000Z	TonyFisher		I just logged on to the second account and it works normally but the GUIs have changed in style.
2011-08-05T04:30:00.000Z	TonyFisher		They all look like something from the late 90s early 2000s
2011-08-05T04:31:00.000Z	TonyFisher		Could this be soemthing bigger than just power management differences/?
2011-08-05T04:31:00.000Z	Fyonte	TonyFisher	What? What is the problem?
2011-08-05T04:32:00.000Z	TonyFisher	Fyonte	my ubuntu netbook on the sudo account would go black (the screen) when I put it on battery power
2011-08-05T04:32:00.000Z	TonyFisher		The other account doesnt have this problem but i just logged back in and the GUi For firefox and Xchat look completely different.
2011-08-05T04:32:00.000Z	Fyonte	TonyFisher	I don't do netbooks, but it does seem like a mode-switch was done, and it lost track of what it was doing.
2011-08-05T04:33:00.000Z	Fyonte	TonyFisher	Kinda like Tony Hawk and Sam Fisher did when you made your name. [it is gag. Relax]
2011-08-05T04:33:00.000Z	Fyonte	TonyFisher	You are now super spy skateboarder....That would be a sweet tv show..
2011-08-05T04:33:00.000Z	TonyFisher	Fyonte	I have been having battery problems before, so could this be the result of that?
2011-08-05T04:34:00.000Z	Fyonte	TonyFisher	Probably. Is it still under warranty?
2011-08-05T04:34:00.000Z	TonyFisher	Fyonte	I don't think so. I have been having these battery problems on start up for a while now
2011-08-05T04:34:00.000Z	TonyFisher		and now they are starting to manifest themselves in my usage.
2011-08-05T04:34:00.000Z	TonyFisher	Fyonte	Besides backing up my shit is there anything I can do to fix this netbook?
2011-08-05T04:35:00.000Z	TonyFisher		Or is it just going to be  a slow decline into oblivion.
2011-08-05T04:35:00.000Z	Fyonte	TonyFisher	I don't know man. Try a clean install. If it happens more, then something is wrong. I can't offer hardware support without having the device..
2011-08-05T04:35:00.000Z	TonyFisher		Alright. Many thanks Fyonte.
2011-08-05T04:35:00.000Z	Fyonte	TonyFisher	And I don't do mobile.
