2009-07-04T03:58:00.000Z	Halitech	harjot	I don;t think you can
2009-07-04T03:59:00.000Z	Halitech	harjot	if its possible then I would assume you would have to remove the modules in the kernel
2009-07-04T04:00:00.000Z	Halitech	harjot	correct
2009-07-04T04:05:00.000Z	Halitech	harjot	is there a reason why you don't just do it in the bios?
2009-07-04T04:06:00.000Z	Halitech	harjot	well instead of just saying without using the bios you should have mentioned you couldn't see the option
2009-07-04T04:07:00.000Z	harjot	Halitech	dont want to use bios anyway i want to do it from kubuntu
2009-07-04T04:09:00.000Z	Halitech	harjot	sometimes want and able are not the same
2009-07-04T04:10:00.000Z	harjot	Halitech	I KNOW U CAN DO THE THING I ASKED
2009-07-04T04:11:00.000Z	Halitech	harjot	then if you know then go do it
2009-08-16T21:01:00.000Z	Halitech	harjot	from a windows computer or to a windows computer?
2009-08-16T21:02:00.000Z	Halitech	harjot	see here http://sshwindows.sourceforge.net/
2009-10-19T03:46:00.000Z	Halitech	harjot	so basically you want to run a mock online "store"
2009-10-19T04:14:00.000Z	Halitech	harjot	not to mention that I doubt most see what you are trying to do as being an ubuntu issue other then you are running ubuntu
