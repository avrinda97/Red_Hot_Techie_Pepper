2009-04-27T17:43:00.000Z	koshar1	KingKimi	use the shared dir
2009-04-27T17:43:00.000Z	KingKimi	koshar1	how ? any links ?
2009-04-27T17:44:00.000Z	KingKimi	koshar1	your reply is not informative :( :(
2009-04-27T17:45:00.000Z	koshar1	KingKimi	if you install the addons there will be a shared folder
2009-04-27T17:45:00.000Z	KingKimi	koshar1	where are the addons ?? any download link ?
2009-04-27T17:46:00.000Z	koshar1	KingKimi	on the Vm go to the install addons , it will mount an iso where you can install the addons withing the client
2009-04-27T17:48:00.000Z	koshar1	KingKimi	 start the client, then devices > install guest addons
2009-04-27T17:49:00.000Z	KingKimi	koshar1	ok .. but it says connection timed out error :'(
2009-04-27T17:52:00.000Z	koshar1	KingKimi	you should install the addons regardless, it makes the vm a lot better experiance, and a lot more seemless\
