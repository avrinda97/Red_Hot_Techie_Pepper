2004-10-01T12:09:00.000Z	WW	rasher	Nonphasis: Is that a mistake on the web page that rasher referred to?  I have linux-restricted-modules-2.6.8.1-2-386, version 2.6.8.1.0-2, and the nvidia driver (nvidia-glx) works.
2004-10-01T12:10:00.000Z	rasher	WW	How do I get a newer linux-restricted-modules then?
2004-10-01T12:11:00.000Z	rasher	WW	but what of the nvidia-glx-config?
2004-10-01T12:12:00.000Z	WW	rasher	Take a look in synaptic (Computer->System Configuration->Synaptic Package Manager
2004-10-01T12:12:00.000Z	rasher	WW	looking for what?
2004-10-01T12:13:00.000Z	WW	rasher	Do you have linux-restricted-modules-<whatever> installed?
2004-10-01T12:13:00.000Z	WW	rasher	... and do you have nvidia-glx installed?
2004-10-01T12:13:00.000Z	rasher	WW	I do, yes.. I also have the nvidia kernel module and I could modprobe it and it'd probably work.. I was just following the directions in the wiki, which seems to be misleading
2004-10-01T12:15:00.000Z	WW	rasher	I muddled through this yesterday.  I didn't use nvidia-glx-config, so I'm not sure what it does.  I didn't see that web page until later :)
2004-10-01T12:17:00.000Z	WW	rasher	Did you just answer your own question?  I also disabled GLCore.
2004-10-01T12:17:00.000Z	rasher	WW	I did, yes
2004-10-01T12:19:00.000Z	WW	rasher	The actual steps weren't too bad, it was just knowing what steps to take!
2004-10-01T12:21:00.000Z	rasher	WW	and this is unfortunate if you're trying to be a relatively easy-to-use desktop distro
2004-10-01T12:21:00.000Z	WW	rasher	yup. 
2004-10-01T12:22:00.000Z	WW	rasher	... but I guess it wouldn't hurt if I added my rough notes to the wiki...
2004-10-01T13:03:00.000Z	rasher	WW	looks right.. except the fact that you have to jump through these hoops isn't right in the first place :)
2004-10-01T14:12:00.000Z	rasher	WW	installing ssh with synaptic?
2004-10-01T14:15:00.000Z	rasher	WW	yeah, openssh-client and openssh-server
2004-10-01T14:16:00.000Z	rasher	WW	so to sum up: apt-get install openssh-server / install openssh-server with synaptic
