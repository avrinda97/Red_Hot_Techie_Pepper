2009-05-10T10:29:00.000Z	LinuxNIT		how come in ubuntu i only have the options for 40/128 bit wep encryption and no 64-bit ?
2009-05-10T10:31:00.000Z	ziroday	LinuxNIT	WEP encryption is insecure, no matter what you do.
2009-05-10T10:32:00.000Z	ziroday	LinuxNIT	I believe 40 == 64
2009-05-10T10:32:00.000Z	LinuxNIT	ziroday	how does that work?
2009-05-10T10:32:00.000Z	ziroday	LinuxNIT	no clue :)
2009-05-10T10:33:00.000Z	LinuxNIT	ziroday	do you know the difference between 128-bit and 128-bit passphrase?
2009-05-10T10:34:00.000Z	ziroday	LinuxNIT	err somewhat, passphrase wants a passphrase whilst 128 bit just wants the key
2009-05-10T10:35:00.000Z	ziroday	LinuxNIT	feel free to PM the key/passphrase and I'll take a guess at which one it is :)
2009-05-10T10:38:00.000Z	LinuxNIT	ziroday	the key is  a1tks3nuyv those are the characters just not in the right order ;)
2009-05-10T10:38:00.000Z	ziroday	LinuxNIT	okay, is it equally jumbled up when in the right order?
2009-05-10T10:39:00.000Z	LinuxNIT	ziroday	what do you mean?
2009-05-10T10:39:00.000Z	ziroday	LinuxNIT	its fine
2009-05-10T10:41:00.000Z	ziroday	LinuxNIT	you still with me?
2009-05-10T10:42:00.000Z	ziroday	LinuxNIT	you want WEP 40/128-bit key
2009-05-10T10:43:00.000Z	LinuxNIT	ziroday	if i choose that then the connect/ok button stays greyed out
2009-05-10T10:43:00.000Z	ziroday	LinuxNIT	hmph
2009-05-10T10:43:00.000Z	LinuxNIT	ziroday	if i choose 128-passphrase it fails to connect
2009-05-10T10:44:00.000Z	ziroday	LinuxNIT	you sure you typed in all 10 chars?
2009-05-10T10:45:00.000Z	ziroday	LinuxNIT	umm, I'm not really sure sorry, that should work (and works over here). Only other idea I have is wicd
