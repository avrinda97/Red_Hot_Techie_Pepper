2009-02-07T12:43:00.000Z	blueraven		I installed ubuntu and I don't know what my username is
2009-02-07T12:43:00.000Z	blueraven		same partition as far as I know
2009-02-07T12:44:00.000Z	blueraven		well, it's called a loop partition
2009-02-07T12:44:00.000Z	blueraven		it's not a real partition
2009-02-07T12:44:00.000Z	blueraven		so, in /home where are the users located?
2009-02-07T12:45:00.000Z	blueraven		I used the livecd to boot into ubuntu and I looked in the home folder and I can't find my actual username
2009-02-07T12:46:00.000Z	blueraven		I'm trying to find out my username for ubuntu and I can't log in to do it without it
2009-02-07T12:47:00.000Z	blueraven		sigh, does anyone know where the users are listed in /home?
2009-02-07T12:48:00.000Z	blueraven		I forgot my username for logging in to ubuntu
2009-02-07T12:48:00.000Z	blueraven		how do I find out what it is?
2009-02-07T12:48:00.000Z	rww	blueraven	If you're booting from the LiveCD, /home/ contains the LiveCD's users, not your hard-disk Ubuntu's users. You'll want to mount your Ubuntu partition and look in its home directory instead.
2009-02-07T12:50:00.000Z	rww	blueraven	sudo mount -o loop <ISO-filename> <mountpoint>
2009-02-07T12:51:00.000Z	rww	blueraven	eep, that should be loop-, rather than ISO-. Same way for both.
2009-02-07T12:54:00.000Z	rww	blueraven	is it a partition on your hard disk, or is it (as you just said) a loopback partition?
2009-02-07T12:54:00.000Z	rww	blueraven	then yes, you have to do it from the command-line. The GNOME program to do it sucks. Loopback partitions aren't really a "novice" thing =/
2009-02-07T12:58:00.000Z	rww	blueraven	Okay, let's back up a bit. You can boot into Ubuntu just fine, but you've forgotten your username and therefore can't log in, right?
2009-02-07T13:01:00.000Z	rww	blueraven	It'd be useful if you answered my question so I check we're on the same page. You can boot into Ubuntu on your hard-drive just fine, but you've forgotten your username and therefore can't log in, right?
2009-02-07T13:04:00.000Z	rww	blueraven	Okay. Rather than mess around with mounting and LiveCDs and everything, you can just use rescue mode on your hard-disk install. Take a look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LostPassword . Once you get to a root prompt, you can do "cat /etc/passwd" to display a list of all users on the system (including system users). Yours will probably be near the bottom of the output.
2009-02-11T15:03:00.000Z	rww	blueraven	if you're using wubi, Ubuntu is installed there, yes
