2010-03-01T02:56:00.000Z	Elrox	JStoone	no, just do sudo -i and you'll be root
2010-03-01T02:56:00.000Z	JStoone	Elrox	Thanks... and I realy have to read the man pages better..
2010-03-01T02:56:00.000Z	JStoone	Elrox	haha
2010-03-01T02:57:00.000Z	Elrox	JStoone	put in YOUR user's password
2010-03-01T02:57:00.000Z	JStoone	Elrox	Yeye I know (; but I just found the "-i" part in the  man pages (:
2010-03-01T02:59:00.000Z	JStoone	Elrox	I do "sudo -i gedit /boot/grub/grub.cfg" and it tells me  "You are trying to save the file on a read-only disk." when I'm about to save..
2010-03-01T03:00:00.000Z	Elrox	JStoone	no, do sudo -i      then try editing stuff
2010-03-01T03:02:00.000Z	JStoone	Elrox	nope doesn't work. Even though it shows I'm root..
2010-03-01T03:03:00.000Z	Elrox	JStoone	are you using vi/vim ?
2010-03-01T03:04:00.000Z	JStoone	Elrox	No I use Gedit
2010-03-01T03:04:00.000Z	Elrox	JStoone	exit your sudo -i,   then do gksudo gedit filename
2010-03-01T03:04:00.000Z	JStoone	Elrox	thanks (:
2010-03-01T03:05:00.000Z	Elrox	JStoone	exit your sudo -i,   then do gksudo gedit /path/to/filename
2010-03-01T03:06:00.000Z	JStoone	Elrox	I'll do as VCoolio told me. To edit the /etc/default/grub and then do "sudo update-grub"
2010-03-01T03:06:00.000Z	Elrox	JStoone	yes, that would be best
2010-03-01T03:06:00.000Z	JStoone	Elrox	Thank you for the help and have a nice evening (:
2010-03-01T03:07:00.000Z	JStoone	Elrox	one last question, isn't there an easier way to exit 'sudo -i' than restarting the terminal?
2010-03-01T03:08:00.000Z	Elrox	JStoone	just type exit
2010-03-01T03:08:00.000Z	JStoone	Elrox	oh! (: I was continuesly typeing 'quit' ^
