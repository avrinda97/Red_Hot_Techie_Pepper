2012-09-07T04:48:00.000Z	dr_willis	veryhappy	 you want to repharse that.. it dident make much sence
2012-09-07T04:52:00.000Z	veryhappy	dr_willis	i want to align the picture on the screen of my tv. i'm not able to find anything for that to use my barebone over hdmi
2012-09-07T04:53:00.000Z	dr_willis	veryhappy	  the nvidia-settings tool here has settings to adjust the 'display' position.
2012-09-07T04:53:00.000Z	dr_willis	veryhappy	  if using hdmi, the  display should be set properly. except perhaps for any overscan settings
2012-09-07T04:53:00.000Z	veryhappy	dr_willis	which package do i have to install for that?
2012-09-07T04:54:00.000Z	dr_willis	veryhappy	 do you have a nvidia card?
2012-09-07T04:54:00.000Z	dr_willis	veryhappy	 install the nvidia drivers yet?
2012-09-07T04:55:00.000Z	dr_willis	veryhappy	 install a vnc server and you have a 'remote' desktop.
2012-09-07T04:56:00.000Z	dr_willis	veryhappy	 if you can actually 'see' the other pcs monitor. You can use synergy to controll it from the local keyboard/mouse
2012-09-07T04:56:00.000Z	dr_willis	veryhappy	 if your sustem has a nvidia card..  you most likely want the nvidia drivers.
2012-09-07T04:56:00.000Z	veryhappy	dr_willis	it has.
2012-11-18T06:25:00.000Z	dr_willis	veryhappy	 check dmesg command output for any potential error messages,
2012-11-18T06:26:00.000Z	veryhappy	dr_willis	deactivated ipv6 due to no exisiting ipv6 router
2012-11-18T06:26:00.000Z	dr_willis	veryhappy	 cant say ive herd about many ipv6 issues these days.
2012-11-18T06:27:00.000Z	veryhappy	dr_willis	i first saw that now that it searched for an ipv6 router that wasn't there
2012-11-18T06:27:00.000Z	veryhappy	dr_willis	i read about a few issues due to missing ipv6 routers
2012-11-20T09:19:00.000Z	dr_willis	veryhappy	 these days - im not sure it matters.. /boot/ on its own partion can be handy
2012-11-20T09:19:00.000Z	dr_willis	veryhappy	 ages ago there was a hardware limit the use of /boot/ on its own partion at teh start of the hard drive got around the limit.
