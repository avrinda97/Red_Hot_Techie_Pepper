2010-05-13T16:13:00.000Z	hvralpha		Has anybody managed to get skype working on a clean X64 install of 10.04
2010-05-13T16:14:00.000Z	jrib	hvralpha	yes, basically just install their deb...
2010-05-13T16:15:00.000Z	hvralpha	jrib	Tried, but says it need ia32libs which will not install on X64 system
2010-05-13T16:17:00.000Z	jrib	hvralpha	why won't it install?
2010-05-13T16:19:00.000Z	hvralpha	jrib	: It says error Error: Cannot install 'lib32stdc++6' which then requires ia32-libs which also will not install on 64 bit systems
2010-05-13T16:20:00.000Z	jrib	hvralpha	pastebin what you are doing and the full output please
2010-05-13T16:24:00.000Z	hvralpha	jrib	click on skype-ubuntu-interprid_2.1.0.81-1_amd64.deb, then let deb installer run which gives  Error: Cannot install 'lib32stdc++6 which is a package it needs which is in ia-32-libs
2010-05-13T16:24:00.000Z	jrib	hvralpha	type in a terminal: sudo apt-get install ia32-libs
2010-05-13T16:28:00.000Z	hvralpha	jrib	have tried apt-get with IA32-libs. Does not install because it says it needs 6 other packages which are dependancies and which will not be installed either.
2010-05-13T16:28:00.000Z	jrib	hvralpha	as I said, it works fine.  ia32-libs is a package for 64bit systems.  I'll be back in a bit, please *pastebin* what I asked
2010-05-13T16:32:00.000Z	jrib	hvralpha	back, did I miss your pastebin?
2010-05-13T16:44:00.000Z	hvralpha	jrib	Ok done in pastebin
2010-05-13T16:44:00.000Z	jrib	hvralpha	link?

2010-05-13T16:52:00.000Z	jrib	hvralpha	your versions seem outdated.  Run « sudo apt-get update » and then paste again
2010-05-13T16:54:00.000Z	hvralpha	jrib	have run update just before I did these. Did it again and same results
2010-05-13T16:54:00.000Z	jrib	hvralpha	use archive.ubuntu.com as your mirror then
