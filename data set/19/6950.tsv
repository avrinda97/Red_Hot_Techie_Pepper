2007-11-04T14:05:00.000Z	spartan049		anyone had problems with poor sound quality in Amarok? I'm running 7.10 with the gnome desktop. Is there a relevant irc channel I could ask this in?
2007-11-04T14:06:00.000Z	starcannon	spartan049	is the sound quality good in other media apps? like sound juicer, totem, or rhythm box?
2007-11-04T14:08:00.000Z	starcannon	spartan049	not sure, I'd probably try Alsa, then OSS and see if one or the other made a difference
2007-11-04T14:10:00.000Z	spartan049	starcannon	Yeah, that was my thinking but it's no different. Also, I can't get the prog to let me switch to a different playback engine. I guess I'll have to poke around on the amarok forum. I've yet to find a program that really comes through as a stable itunes alt
2007-11-04T14:11:00.000Z	starcannon	spartan049	ah i see, not sure if its what you want, but have you looked at the plugins for rhythm box? i think its got at least a couple mp3 for sale plugins with it
2007-11-04T14:13:00.000Z	spartan049	starcannon	Yeah, I'm using rhythmbox now. All I really want is a stable media library app, and it's the only one I've found that doesn't have some issue (sound quality, crashing, bugs, etc.). And I really don't care about any type of mp3 store, just a solid app that's as simple as itunes
2007-11-04T14:14:00.000Z	starcannon	spartan049	aye, i hear ya, are you using Kubuntu?
2007-11-04T14:16:00.000Z	spartan049	starcannon	nope, just standard ubuntu. I find the simplicity of gnome more appealing than KDE. I've dabbled with ubuntu off and on since 6.xx but this is the first time I've used it almost exclusively
2007-11-04T14:16:00.000Z	starcannon	spartan049	i see that Kbuntu uses Amarok right out of the box, might be an option, might not, /shrug, I'm a Gnome junky myself
2007-11-04T14:16:00.000Z	starcannon	spartan049	ah yep I agree
2007-11-04T14:16:00.000Z	spartan049	starcannon	thanks for your help
2007-11-04T14:16:00.000Z	starcannon	spartan049	this is my 3rd year of linux exclusively
2007-11-04T14:17:00.000Z	starcannon	spartan049	sorry I wasnt of much help :( but welcome anyway
2007-11-04T14:18:00.000Z	spartan049	starcannon	I've been reluctant to switch because of a couple programs, but vmware is making it more of a possibility. I don't think I can completely go exclusive though
2007-11-04T14:19:00.000Z	starcannon	spartan049	yeah i'm in a place in my life where I can, but who knows what will happen after college is done, could find that I have to put winders on a partition somewhere for work
2007-11-04T14:20:00.000Z	spartan049	starcannon	I'm a music major and that type of software just isn't mature enough on linux
2007-11-04T14:23:00.000Z	starcannon	spartan049	yeah, I'm surprised your not using a mac for that actually, though MS has some nice apps for it as well
2007-11-04T14:23:00.000Z	spartan049	starcannon	macs==$$$
2007-11-04T14:24:00.000Z	starcannon	spartan049	yeah, but they last awhile to, but I hear ya, you can build a PC of equivalent power for a 1/3 the cost
