2004-09-30T05:32:00.000Z	Mayonaise		im just gonna do a new ftp install
2004-09-30T05:32:00.000Z	Mayonaise		and try over again
2004-09-30T05:32:00.000Z	Mayonaise		adonijah, are al the things that were available in debian available for ubuntu?
2004-09-30T05:32:00.000Z	Adonijah	Mayonaise	i don't think everything is, but supposedly there are 12,000 packages total avail
2004-09-30T05:33:00.000Z	Adonijah	Mayonaise	once you include universe/restricted
2004-09-30T05:33:00.000Z	Adonijah	Mayonaise	you don't
2004-09-30T05:33:00.000Z	Adonijah	Mayonaise	it's been disabled
2004-09-30T05:34:00.000Z	Adonijah	Mayonaise	if you need a root 'shell' just do 'sudo -s'
2004-09-30T05:34:00.000Z	Adonijah	Mayonaise	security, and to encourage people to not do things as root, since that's dangerous
2004-09-30T05:34:00.000Z	Adonijah	Mayonaise	i would imagine anyway
2004-09-30T05:35:00.000Z	Adonijah	Mayonaise	the less things that run as root, the better
2004-09-30T05:35:00.000Z	Adonijah	Mayonaise	if anything is horribly incovenient or difficult to do or use with the default setup, i would imagine the project would like your feedback about what's bad with the sudo setup
2004-09-30T05:36:00.000Z	Adonijah	Mayonaise	so far though, i've found that having sudo -s available to me makes life as easy as normal
2004-09-30T05:37:00.000Z	Adonijah	Mayonaise	open a query window to me and paste the output
2004-09-30T05:37:00.000Z	Adonijah	Mayonaise	to me
2004-09-30T05:37:00.000Z	Adonijah	Mayonaise	i imagine you're just seeing a warning about the update
2004-09-30T05:38:00.000Z	Adonijah	Mayonaise	oh, well later then
2004-09-30T05:38:00.000Z	Adonijah	Mayonaise	i imagine you're just seeing a warning about the update
2004-09-30T05:38:00.000Z	Adonijah	Mayonaise	because I get the same message, but I can still install things
