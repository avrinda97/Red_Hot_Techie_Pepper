2004-12-14T09:40:00.000Z	bob2	amer	no, you need to be more specifric
2004-12-14T09:42:00.000Z	bob2	amer	what are you trying to copy, and to where?
2004-12-14T09:44:00.000Z	bob2	amer	are you sure /usr/local/share/mplayer/skin/ exists?
2004-12-14T09:45:00.000Z	bob2	amer	so what does 'ls -ld /usr/local/share/mplayer/skin/' print out?
2004-12-14T09:46:00.000Z	bob2	amer	what does 'pwd' print out?
2004-12-14T09:46:00.000Z	bob2	amer	you need to be careful about making sure you're typing all these commands correctly
2004-12-14T09:47:00.000Z	bob2	amer	yes, everything in unix more or less is case sensitive
2004-12-14T09:48:00.000Z	bob2	amer	you need to give us more context
2004-12-14T09:48:00.000Z	bob2	amer	you just realised you misspelt Skins now?
2004-12-14T09:52:00.000Z	amer	bob2	 thx for the help
2004-12-14T09:55:00.000Z	amer	bob2	what available packages
