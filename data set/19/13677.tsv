2005-04-14T05:48:00.000Z	hybrid	Blissex	and Arnia : I like the Ubuntu numbering 5.04 4.10 thats cool and fun
2005-04-14T05:49:00.000Z	Blissex	hybrid	yes, that numbering is OK, and should be just like that.
2005-04-14T05:49:00.000Z	hybrid	Blissex	: then reffer to the numbering no1 says you have to call it hoary anywhere but your repos most of us know what 4.10 and 5.04 is
2005-04-14T05:50:00.000Z	hybrid	Blissex	: hoary is easier to put in the repos then 5.04
