2007-04-21T06:11:00.000Z	ytsestef		ello! i have troubles getting amarok to work in ubuntu feisty (x86), flac is not supported while, when i load an mp3 file it just hangs
2007-04-21T06:12:00.000Z	ytsestef		in short: i can't play back any mp3 or flac or wav file in amarok!
2007-04-21T06:12:00.000Z	delire	ytsestef	can you play them in other applications?
2007-04-21T06:13:00.000Z	ytsestef	delire	yes! amarok says there are no flac codecs. as for mp3, it pops up a message which asks me to install mp3 codecs and before i am able to click "yes" the application hangs
2007-04-21T06:14:00.000Z	delire	ytsestef	right, that isn't good. is your system updated?
2007-04-21T06:16:00.000Z	delire	ytsestef	i don't know what to suggest here other than trying to install support for these codecs manually. look at the RestrictedFormats section of the help wiki
2007-04-21T06:17:00.000Z	ytsestef	delire	i have the restricted package installed :(
2007-04-21T06:18:00.000Z	delire	ytsestef	right
2007-04-21T06:19:00.000Z	delire	ytsestef	i don't know what to suggest. can you try to play an mp3 on the commandline with 'play file.mp3'?
2007-04-21T06:21:00.000Z	ytsestef	delire	this is unfortunately an amarok related problem, mp3 and flac are playing without a hitch in any other app
2007-04-21T06:22:00.000Z	delire	ytsestef	right. perhaps there's an amarok channel?
2007-04-21T06:23:00.000Z	ytsestef	delire	that's a pity because i tried kubuntu and amarok is working great. the thing is i dont like kubuntu (or KDE in general)

2007-04-21T06:26:00.000Z	delire	ytsestef	i don't use amarok so can't help there sorry. good luck. it sounds to me like amarok expects a kde related sound service to exist that doesn't, or is being overridden by another..
2007-04-21T06:27:00.000Z	ytsestef	delire	thanks for the try!
2007-04-21T06:31:00.000Z	ytsestef	delire	thanks for the link. I am investigating... :)
2007-04-21T06:35:00.000Z	ytsestef	delire	it was way too simple. it worked! woohoo mp3 AND flac!
2007-04-21T06:36:00.000Z	ytsestef	delire	thanks a lot for the link.
2007-04-21T06:37:00.000Z	delire	ytsestef	 :)
