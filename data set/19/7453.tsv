2009-10-20T08:43:00.000Z	crohakon		No one is willing to recommend a gui ftp client? =(
2009-10-20T08:43:00.000Z	Bossmanbeta	crohakon	filezilla
2009-10-20T08:43:00.000Z	crohakon	ubuntu	will not allow filezilla to install because it says it will not run on x64
2009-10-20T08:43:00.000Z	crohakon		otherwise, yes, I would use filezilla
2009-10-20T08:44:00.000Z	crohakon		though it is odd... filezilla installed and worked just fine on opensuse x64.... *innocent expression*

2009-10-20T08:45:00.000Z	Bossmanbeta		how do you force ubuntuone to sync with the cloud? No one's answering in #ubuntuone. I tried disconnecting/re-connecting, doesn't seem to work and I've added files I don't see in the web interface.
2009-10-20T08:46:00.000Z	Bossmanbeta	crohakon	also here: http://www.getdeb.net/app/FileZilla for the .deb's

2009-10-20T08:48:00.000Z	Bossmanbeta		sure crohakon -- cheers
2009-10-20T08:48:00.000Z	crohakon		Wait... is ubuntu based on debian?
2009-10-20T08:48:00.000Z	Bossmanbeta	crohakon	yes
2009-10-20T08:49:00.000Z	crohakon		Wow... I have come back to my roots and did not even know it. The first linux dist I ever poked around in was debian. I remember ordering the CD's when I was like 16. lol Nice.
