2012-02-22T04:33:00.000Z	t432		My wireless connection keep disocnnecting after awhile... what could be the problem?
2012-02-22T04:33:00.000Z	t432		works only after switching  router/modem on/off
2012-02-22T04:35:00.000Z	t432		ok
2012-02-22T04:36:00.000Z	t432		it disconnected randomly whilst active
2012-02-22T04:36:00.000Z	t432		disconnects*
2012-02-22T04:37:00.000Z	t432		how can I check the current status?
2012-02-22T04:38:00.000Z	rattatoue	t432	sudo iwconfig wlan0...then look part ways down you will see Power Management: on or off
2012-02-22T04:35:00.000Z	rattatoue	t432	I know in vista/win7 there was a power management feature. When the computer was inactive or something it would power down the device. So I had similar problems to yours. I am not sure if Ubuntu has the same feature or not.
2012-02-22T04:37:00.000Z	rattatoue	t432	try this "sudo iwconfig wlan0 power off" that should disable the power management on it still. See if that fixes it.
2012-02-22T04:37:00.000Z	rattatoue	t432	wlan0 is whatever your wireless connector is, ex wlan1 or wlan2 change the wlan0 part
2012-02-22T04:40:00.000Z	rattatoue	t432	yes that means your power management is on right now. Which could be causing your problem.
2012-02-22T04:40:00.000Z	t432	rattatoue	I doubt this is the problem because wireless remains connected but no data.  Works only after turing modem and router on and off
2012-02-22T04:41:00.000Z	rattatoue	t432	okay. Have you tried switching channels on your router yet?
2012-02-22T04:42:00.000Z	rattatoue	t432	if something is interfering with your wireless channel. Ergo a house phone something, it can cause the same problem as its using the same channel.
2012-02-22T04:48:00.000Z	rattatoue	t432	whether you think its the problem or not. I have read a lot of articles about the power-management feature causing slower then normal wifi connection for both Windows 7 and Ubuntu. So either way might be a good idea to turn it off. I do it by default with both windows and ubuntu.
2012-02-22T04:48:00.000Z	t432	rattatoue	i'll do that
2012-02-22T04:49:00.000Z	t432	rattatoue	how do I apply it permenantly?
2012-02-22T04:49:00.000Z	rattatoue	t432	after you do the sudo iwconfig part and that, it should stay permanent
2012-02-22T04:50:00.000Z	rattatoue	t432	are you asking for the command again or saying its off now?
