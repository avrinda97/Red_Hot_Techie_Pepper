2009-06-05T21:49:00.000Z	Dreamglider		can anyone help me to shut down the cpu/gpu fans ?
2009-06-05T21:50:00.000Z	cabrey	Dreamglider	you really don't want to do that
2009-06-05T21:51:00.000Z	Dreamglider	cabrey	i do indeed, they are at full blast even tho the temp is 32 deg C !!
2009-06-05T21:51:00.000Z	cabrey	Dreamglider	mobo model?
2009-06-05T21:52:00.000Z	Dreamglider	cabrey	dell 0YD479
2009-06-05T21:53:00.000Z	cabrey	Dreamglider	actually give the desktop model (e.g. insprion 4500)
2009-06-05T21:53:00.000Z	Dreamglider	cabrey	it's a dell inspiron 9400.
2009-06-05T21:55:00.000Z	cabrey	Dreamglider	have you tried the GKrellm/i8kutils package[s]?
2009-06-05T21:56:00.000Z	Dreamglider	cabrey	yes i have, i can do i8kfan 0 0 to stop the fan's but after about 5 sec they start again
2009-06-05T21:56:00.000Z	cabrey	Dreamglider	with gkrellm?
2009-06-05T21:57:00.000Z	Dreamglider	cabrey	i dont know how to get i8k to work with gkrellm
2009-06-05T21:58:00.000Z	cabrey	Dreamglider	you could try cpu scaling: http://www.ubuntugeek.com/howto-change-cpu-frequency-scaling-in-ubuntu.html
2009-06-05T21:59:00.000Z	Dreamglider	cabrey	i have freq scaling, i usually keep it on demand.
2009-06-05T22:00:00.000Z	cabrey	Dreamglider	when you used the fan control, you said the fans stopped (do you mean completely?) then 5 seconds after, right?
2009-06-05T22:01:00.000Z	Dreamglider	cabrey	yes if i do i8kfan 0 0 they stop, 1 1 is low speed and 2 2 set's them to full speed, but it is only effective for about 5 seconds
2009-06-05T22:01:00.000Z	cabrey	Dreamglider	for every setting? sounds like a bug. you may have to take it up at launchpad bugs
2009-06-05T22:02:00.000Z	Dreamglider	cabrey	how can i add the i8k plugin to gkrellm
2009-06-05T22:04:00.000Z	cabrey	Dreamglider	sudo apt-get install gkrellm-i8k
2009-06-05T22:22:00.000Z	Dreamglider	cabrey	i installed the i8k plugin, but in manual mode the fan's start spinnign again after abt 5 seconds
