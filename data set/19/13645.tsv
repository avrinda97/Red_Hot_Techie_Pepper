2005-02-25T13:49:00.000Z	Levander		Does everyone have like 30 hal-hotplug processes on their ubuntu box, or is it just me?
2005-02-25T13:49:00.000Z	sjoerd	Levander	you've got probably some D processes then
2005-02-25T13:50:00.000Z	Levander	sjoerd	a d process is a deamon?
2005-02-25T13:50:00.000Z	Levander	sjoerd	i've got one hald process running
2005-02-25T13:50:00.000Z	sjoerd	Levander	no. It's one that is waiting on something from the kernel
2005-02-25T13:51:00.000Z	sjoerd	Levander	if that has status D then your screwed
2005-02-25T13:51:00.000Z	Levander	sjoerd	what app to use to find d processes, doesn't show up under system monitor
2005-02-25T13:52:00.000Z	sjoerd	Levander	you can turn on ``Status'' in the preference
2005-02-25T13:52:00.000Z	Levander	sjoerd	found status under system monitor, it says "sleeping" for all the hal-hotplug processes
2005-02-25T13:52:00.000Z	sjoerd	Levander	and for the hald
2005-02-25T13:54:00.000Z	Levander	sjoerd	all the hot-plug processes say they using 1.4 MB of memory each.  Are they all really using that much memory, or could these be memory shared by the processes, just reported a bunch of times?
2005-02-25T13:55:00.000Z	sjoerd	Levander	both
2005-02-25T13:56:00.000Z	Levander	sjoerd	u mean that some of the 1.4 MB is shared, and some of it is used individually by a process?
2005-02-25T13:56:00.000Z	sjoerd	Levander	yah
2005-02-25T13:57:00.000Z	Levander	sjoerd	thanks, looks like I could save some memory if I take the time to figure out what the hell is wrong w those processes, on 512MB machine, might speed things up a little, i'll try to look into this week, thanks again.
2005-02-25T13:57:00.000Z	sjoerd	Levander	they shouldn't be lingering around
2005-02-25T13:58:00.000Z	Levander	sjoerd	but is there any good documentation on understanding more in-depth what is reported by system-monitor, would be interesting
2005-02-25T13:58:00.000Z	sjoerd	Levander	dunno
2005-02-25T13:58:00.000Z	Levander	sjoerd	cool, i'll google later, thanks for help
