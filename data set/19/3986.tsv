2009-07-01T05:54:00.000Z	dutch		so i just installed the nvidia restricted drivers, and now xorg is hosed, it wont even start. can anyone tell me how to revert to a working xconfig?
2009-07-01T05:54:00.000Z	coleys	dutch	Are you at command line?
2009-07-01T05:55:00.000Z	dutch	coleys	yessir
2009-07-01T05:55:00.000Z	coleys	dutch	sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2009-07-01T05:56:00.000Z	dutch	coleys	there is no Nvidia device, because i ran a dpkg-reconfigure on xserver-xorg to try to fix it
2009-07-01T05:56:00.000Z	coleys	dutch	type: sudo nvidia-xconfig?
2009-07-01T05:57:00.000Z	coleys	dutch	startx
2009-07-01T05:57:00.000Z	coleys	dutch	?
2009-07-01T05:59:00.000Z	dutch	coleys	startx tells me no screens found...
2009-07-01T05:59:00.000Z	coleys	dutch	sudo init 5?
2009-07-01T06:00:00.000Z	dutch	coleys	nothing happens, init 5 just returns to the shell
2009-07-01T06:00:00.000Z	coleys	dutch	okay... sudo rm -rf /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2009-07-01T06:01:00.000Z	dutch	coleys	lol init 5 stopped my keyboard from working on the other virtual terminals
2009-07-01T06:03:00.000Z	dutch	coleys	so what do i do after removing the xconfig?
2009-07-01T06:05:00.000Z	coleys	dutch	Have you removed it? If so I'd try a reboot, xorg might be recreated.
2009-07-01T06:05:00.000Z	dutch	coleys	alrighty ill try that, and i might brb ;-)
2009-07-01T06:06:00.000Z	coleys	dutch	If not, we'll try some more troubleshooting =)
2009-07-01T06:20:00.000Z	dutch	coleys	so that didnt work, but i can tell that the nvidia-xconfig ALMOST makes X work. but X says it cant find any devices
2009-07-01T06:21:00.000Z	dutch	coleys	you know anything about AllowEmptyInput in xconfig?
