2010-05-12T22:42:00.000Z	csb		Hi :)
2010-05-12T22:42:00.000Z	csb		I'm seriously struggling with my Samba shares onm Lucid, is anyone able to help me with that?
2010-05-12T22:42:00.000Z	csb		I can't get my EXTERNAL ntfs-formatted drives shared
2010-05-12T22:43:00.000Z	csb		internal ones work fine
2010-05-12T22:43:00.000Z	csb		tried classic and nautilus share ... nothing :(
2010-05-12T22:43:00.000Z	Mathuin	csb	do you know whether or not the operating system can see those drives?  do they show up in dmesg?
2010-05-12T22:43:00.000Z	csb		They show up but I have to enter username/pass
2010-05-12T22:44:00.000Z	csb		despite having enabled guest access
2010-05-12T22:44:00.000Z	csb		it's the exact same setting that works perfectly fine for my shares on interla drives
2010-05-12T22:44:00.000Z	Mathuin	csb	wacky.
2010-05-12T22:44:00.000Z	csb		six shares: 3 internal, 3 external
2010-05-12T22:44:00.000Z	csb		IDENTICAL settings in smb.conf
2010-05-12T22:45:00.000Z	csb		internal ones work
2010-05-12T22:45:00.000Z	csb		external ones don't
2010-05-12T22:46:00.000Z	csb	Mathuin	thanks for your help, though :)
2010-05-12T22:46:00.000Z	csb		I guess iut's a bit too crowded in here
2010-05-12T22:46:00.000Z	csb		I guess I'll try the forums, thanks
2010-05-12T22:46:00.000Z	Mathuin	csb	no problem.  I had some hassle with password-protection here on a share but it was because ubuntu didn't know it wasn't a browse master or something.
2010-05-12T22:46:00.000Z	Mathuin	csb	good luck!
