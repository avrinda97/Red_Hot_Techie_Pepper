2008-07-01T11:15:00.000Z	quicksilver_		Can anybody help me out with my GPU issue? Ive noticed that any time my GPU hits 62 C, it crashes ubuntu.... Drives me insane when it happens to me at work.
2008-07-01T11:16:00.000Z	quicksilver_		Just putting load on it.
2008-07-01T11:16:00.000Z	quicksilver_		It always happens when it gets to 62.
2008-07-01T11:16:00.000Z	quicksilver_		And yes, lmsensors, and the gnome applet.

2008-07-01T11:39:00.000Z	t35t0r	quicksilver_	I dunno if it'll work but what if you uninstall the ubuntu drivers and try installing from the official nvidia installer?
2008-07-01T11:40:00.000Z	quicksilver_	t35t0r	The last time I tried to do that, I couldnt get into GNOME. :) So Ive been a chicken ever since.
