2010-04-29T21:41:00.000Z	Guest5979		no, i just need a newer kernel, so i can use KMS with my radeon card
2010-04-29T21:42:00.000Z	Guest5979		anyone familiar with the KMS with a radeon card under Karmic ?
2010-04-29T21:42:00.000Z	minimec	Guest5979	Well it's running here... ;)
2010-04-29T21:43:00.000Z	minimec	Guest5979	what are your problems?
2010-04-29T21:44:00.000Z	Guest5979		when i add 'radeon.modeset=1" to the line GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT between the " marks, after the quiet, with a space between them, the login fucks up :)
2010-04-29T21:44:00.000Z	Guest5979		basicly i wont have the graphic login, just a terminal login, and i cant log in to the graphic desktop
2010-04-29T21:45:00.000Z	minimec	Guest5979	Can you give me the output line of 'lspci | grep VGA'?
2010-04-29T21:45:00.000Z	Guest5979		sure, 1 moment
2010-04-29T21:45:00.000Z	Guest5979		ATI Technologies Inc R420 JI [Radeon X800PRO]
2010-04-29T21:46:00.000Z	Guest5979		since i cant install catalyst 9.3 under catalys, and later ones doesent support my card, im trying KMS (read somewhere it might help )
2010-04-29T21:47:00.000Z	Guest5979	minimec	i have Radeon X800 PRO
2010-04-29T21:47:00.000Z	minimec	Guest5979	My experiences with karmic and ATI were not that good. There is a ppa https://launchpad.net/~xorg-edgers/+archive/ppa for recent driver versions. I also decided to upgrade the kernel via the kernel mainline site.
2010-04-29T21:48:00.000Z	minimec	Guest5979	The results afterwords were much better.
2010-04-29T21:48:00.000Z	minimec	Guest5979	All that stuff is in Ubuntu 10.04 coming today ;)
2010-04-29T21:48:00.000Z	Guest5979	minimec	i dont understand, what is coming today:?:)
2010-04-29T21:49:00.000Z	Guest5979		lol, ive choose the day quite good :)
2010-04-29T21:50:00.000Z	minimec	Guest5979	There is a new version of ubuntu coming today 10.04 Lucid lynx. If you upgrade your system, your card will respond better. Just wait another day and start your computer. The system will indicate you the upgrade ;)
2010-04-29T21:50:00.000Z	Guest5979	minimec	thanks for the advice :) ill try it again tomorrow, hope it worksl ol
2010-04-29T21:50:00.000Z	minimec	Guest5979	no problem
