2012-05-16T23:03:00.000Z	L3top	kkrauss	make sure that you explain to them you are using crap equipment with few resources as well.
2012-05-16T23:16:00.000Z	kkrauss	L3top	you are a wound a little tight my friend.  I was showing my appreciation and joking around with you, its all good.
2012-05-16T23:16:00.000Z	kkrauss	L3top	again i sincerely appreciate your help.
2012-05-16T23:18:00.000Z	L3top	kkrauss	in the case of unity, I would say absolutely not. This opinion does not make me popular.
2012-05-16T23:19:00.000Z	L3top	kkrauss	then I would go with the newer kernel.
2012-05-16T23:21:00.000Z	kkrauss	L3top	out of curiosity are you familiar with how to set up network installs using ubuntu?
2012-05-16T23:22:00.000Z	L3top	kkrauss	distributed installs? or setting up complicated networking?
2012-05-16T23:22:00.000Z	kkrauss	L3top	in my lap at my university, we were able to boot off the network and install a plethora of operating systems
2012-05-16T23:23:00.000Z	kkrauss	L3top	if I could set that up for myself that would be pretty cool but something tells me its not easy task
2012-05-16T23:23:00.000Z	kkrauss	L3top	well for you maybe, bu not for me
2012-05-16T23:23:00.000Z	L3top	kkrauss	We do a lot of PXE booting, slim clients... but they have no HDs and we do not install... so none I am afraid.
2012-05-16T23:24:00.000Z	kkrauss	L3top	I see a minor problem with 12.04 desktop, its requires a gig of ram
2012-05-16T23:25:00.000Z	L3top	kkrauss	as I said... I am not particularly fond. Try kubuntu. SOMEHOW it has become the lightweight alternative.
