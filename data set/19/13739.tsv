2005-03-05T06:22:00.000Z	Vjaz	elf	on what premises?
2005-03-05T06:22:00.000Z	Vjaz	elf	gnome
2005-03-05T06:28:00.000Z	Vjaz	elf	well, they're different libraries... they mostly serve the same purpose
2005-03-05T06:28:00.000Z	Vjaz	elf	xine supports stuff like DVD's better I think
2005-03-05T06:28:00.000Z	Vjaz	elf	gstreamer is fine for open stuff at least
2005-03-05T06:29:00.000Z	Vjaz	elf	I think gstreamer got DVD support only recently... not sure if it works too well
2005-03-05T06:30:00.000Z	Vjaz	elf	 my impression is that most people use totem-xine
2005-03-05T06:31:00.000Z	Vjaz	elf	it supports more formats out of the box, so it's easier to setup
2005-03-05T06:32:00.000Z	Vjaz	elf	not sure... I use gstreamer at the moment, but then again, I don't have it setup for playing any propietary stuff
