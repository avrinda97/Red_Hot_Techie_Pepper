2008-05-31T14:49:00.000Z	thegeek	san|	Is there an easy way to do that?  I'm a bit n00bish when it comes to GRUB

2008-05-31T14:56:00.000Z	san|	thegeek	you point out with hd0,0 where grub is installed (afaik)
2008-05-31T14:58:00.000Z	thegeek	san|	Right, but hd0,0 points to the MBR or it points to a partition?  The page states that it points to the "first partition" .... I'm thinking they have it wrong and that hd0,0 is really the MBR which is where I want GRUB to be
2008-05-31T15:01:00.000Z	san|	thegeek	I believe you have to tell grub where it can find the configuration files which are on you linux partition.
2008-05-31T15:01:00.000Z	thegeek	san|	Mmmmm....
2008-05-31T15:01:00.000Z	thegeek	san|	Okay, well I'll look at some docs for a bit, thanks =)
2008-05-31T15:01:00.000Z	san|	thegeek	check https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows
2008-05-31T15:01:00.000Z	san|	thegeek	there is all the info required
2008-05-31T15:02:00.000Z	san|	thegeek	it's been a while for me (not using windows anymore on this machine :) )
2008-05-31T15:02:00.000Z	thegeek	san|	Yeah, I got that one up....well it's a simple template but it doesn't really fully explain what you're doing I think.
2008-05-31T15:02:00.000Z	thegeek	san|	I wouldn't be using Windows at all either, except I need it to play The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion

2008-05-31T15:03:00.000Z	thegeek	san|	Ah so the setup line "setup (hd0)" is what installs it to the MBR....
2008-05-31T15:04:00.000Z	thegeek	san|	Ahaha, wine and I are not best friends.
2008-05-31T15:04:00.000Z	san|	thegeek	I'm off (have to work on my thesis *sigh*) goodluck!
2008-05-31T15:05:00.000Z	thegeek	san|	Thanks, and thanks for the help, good luck on your thesis =)
2008-05-31T15:05:00.000Z	san|	thegeek	k, tnx
