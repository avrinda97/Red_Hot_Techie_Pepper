2008-11-14T22:13:00.000Z	ikonia	norbert79	I know, I've apologied to him
2008-12-30T18:41:00.000Z	ikonia	norbert79	don't talk nonsense
2012-01-26T16:40:00.000Z	norbert79	ikonia	True, but could give one a start
2012-01-26T16:40:00.000Z	norbert79	ikonia	I use Google for such further questions then
2012-01-26T16:44:00.000Z	norbert79	ikonia	Irony :)
2012-01-26T16:45:00.000Z	ikonia	norbert79	what are you talking about
2012-01-26T16:45:00.000Z	ikonia	norbert79	how are you googling his problems when he's only just told us the network card model
2012-01-26T16:46:00.000Z	norbert79	ikonia	Well, I did a quick lookup, and I can also see his problems listed
2012-01-26T16:47:00.000Z	ikonia	norbert79	quick look up of what, ?? he's only just shown us the model number
2012-01-26T16:49:00.000Z	norbert79	ikonia	Listen, if his server gets dropped anyway while a new kernel install a try for a more recent kernel won1t hurt, and won't take longer, than 5 minutes... Worst case he needs to do an apt-get purge of the newer kernel... It's not like modifying a whole filesystem...
2012-01-26T16:49:00.000Z	ikonia	norbert79	yes it will
2012-01-26T16:49:00.000Z	ikonia	norbert79	randomly enabling back ports and proposed update repos with no reason is very dangerous and can pull in dependencies that cause problems/break other things
2012-01-26T16:50:00.000Z	norbert79	ikonia	Aw come on, you can't think of this serious. This way youa re saying, that Ubuntu offers bad things in it's repos...
2012-01-26T16:51:00.000Z	ikonia	norbert79	no - I'm saying it offers things that can conflict with the base product / not stable that's what "proprosed is" - not production ready a proposed update
2012-01-26T16:51:00.000Z	ikonia	norbert79	so putting that sort of thing on a production server which could update dependencies is not a good idea, more so when there is no thought behind it or research
2012-01-26T16:52:00.000Z	norbert79	ikonia	Besides, he just needs to switch back to the older kernel, that's it... Keeping it simple works always
2012-01-26T16:53:00.000Z	norbert79	ikonia	Like if he isn't forced doing 'research' during every upgrade...
2012-01-26T16:53:00.000Z	ikonia	norbert79	what ?
