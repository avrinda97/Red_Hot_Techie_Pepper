2011-12-20T07:52:00.000Z	cipherboy	borillion	grep for (WW) and look at the nvidia warnings
2011-12-20T07:57:00.000Z	borillion	cipherboy	there are some (ww) errors, do you want me to separate them or something?
2011-12-20T07:59:00.000Z	borillion	cipherboy	none of them look like bad errors, things like couldn't find such font etc
2011-12-20T07:59:00.000Z	cipherboy	borillion	refresh my memory on the problem, was afk
2011-12-20T08:00:00.000Z	borillion	cipherboy	My X crashes all the way back to login when I run Calibre, VirtualBox etc
2011-12-20T08:01:00.000Z	cipherboy	borillion	and you are running what wm?
2011-12-20T08:03:00.000Z	borillion	cipherboy	Im running whatever comes with ubuntu 11.10
2011-12-20T08:04:00.000Z	cipherboy	borillion	You tried seeing if unity has a logging feature?
2011-12-20T08:13:00.000Z	borillion	cipherboy	says to run unity --advanced-debug from tty
2011-12-20T08:13:00.000Z	borillion	cipherboy	is that crtl+alt+shift+F*
2011-12-20T08:14:00.000Z	cipherboy	borillion	Ctrl+Alt+F1 for first TTY
2011-12-20T08:15:00.000Z	borillion	cipherboy	gives me a prompt with (gdb) instead of $
2011-12-20T08:16:00.000Z	cipherboy	borillion	interesting, try other ttys. But you have to log in first.
2011-12-20T08:19:00.000Z	cipherboy	borillion	so when you run the command you get the (gdb)?
