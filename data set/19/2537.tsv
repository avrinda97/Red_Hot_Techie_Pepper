2012-01-19T17:11:00.000Z	nielz		does anyone know how to remove a mount option from a disk (set via the gui) in ubuntu 9.04?
2012-01-19T17:11:00.000Z	nielz		I set a bad option, now the disk won't mount but I can't find where to unset the option
2012-01-19T17:11:00.000Z	theadmin	nielz	Option?... I don't think we even set mouse options via the GUI at all
2012-01-19T17:12:00.000Z	nielz	theadmin	mount option for a disk
2012-01-19T17:12:00.000Z	theadmin	nielz	Anyway, unless it's the root drive, you should edit /etc/fstab manually
2012-01-19T17:12:00.000Z	theadmin	nielz	err, s/mouse/mount/, sorry, idk what I was thinking about xD
2012-01-19T17:12:00.000Z	theadmin	nielz	Add it to fstab then, what's the big deal with that
2012-01-19T17:16:00.000Z	nielz	theadmin	the big deal is I got 25 of these devices and I need to configure some mount options which must preferably be set via the gui some I don't have to do it myself :)
2012-01-19T17:17:00.000Z	theadmin	nielz	GUI is evil.
2012-01-19T17:17:00.000Z	theadmin	nielz	I don't even know *how* to set mount options via the GUI
2012-01-19T17:18:00.000Z	nielz	theadmin	yet I need to do it via the gui, I know how to mount a drive manually or via fstab
2012-01-19T17:18:00.000Z	nielz	theadmin	but I have no set the option and it must be stored *somewhere*
2012-01-19T17:19:00.000Z	theadmin	nielz	dconf probably.
2012-01-19T17:26:00.000Z	nielz	theadmin	I found it in .gconf/system/storage/volumes, dunno if that is dconf though, but I found it :)
2012-01-19T17:26:00.000Z	theadmin	nielz	Yeah. But don't touch that manually. Use gconf-editor.
2012-01-19T17:26:00.000Z	theadmin	nielz	Or else you might make GNOME unusable
2012-01-19T17:30:00.000Z	nielz	theadmin	fixed :)
2012-01-19T17:30:00.000Z	theadmin	nielz	GLaD to be of help
2012-01-19T17:30:00.000Z	nielz	theadmin	thanks
