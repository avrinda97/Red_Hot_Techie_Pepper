2007-01-22T07:19:00.000Z	_dd02_		ooh that could help me
2007-01-22T07:21:00.000Z	_dd02_		when I run the command lspci in the terminal, the display controller says "ATI Technologies Inc: Unknown device 7269" is that a good or bad thing? or will that change if I install the neccessary drivers?
2007-01-22T07:22:00.000Z	arrenlex	_dd02_	That's a bad thing. What kernel?
2007-01-22T07:23:00.000Z	_dd02_	arrenlex	eh? kernel? what do you mean >_< ubuntu 6.06
2007-01-22T07:23:00.000Z	arrenlex	_dd02_	What does "uname -r" say?
2007-01-22T07:24:00.000Z	arrenlex	_dd02_	Hmm... you could try seeing if a newer kernel detects your card.
2007-01-22T07:25:00.000Z	arrenlex	_dd02_	Are you running dapper? You might need to upgrade to Edgy for that. Dapper isn't getting any new package versions anymore.
2007-01-22T07:27:00.000Z	arrenlex	_dd02_	Yeah, that looks like a very new card, doesn't it?
2007-01-22T07:27:00.000Z	arrenlex	_dd02_	While in general I don't recommend running a 64-bit system, it shouldn't interfere with your card.
2007-01-22T07:30:00.000Z	arrenlex	_dd02_	For desktop use, you will not notice any performance difference in a 64-bit system. However, you will have compatibility problems with things like Flash, Wine, and media codecs that are only available 32-bit.
2007-01-22T07:31:00.000Z	arrenlex	_dd02_	What happens if you try "apt-get install wpasupplicant"?
2007-01-22T07:32:00.000Z	_dd02_	arrenlex	Could not open lock file /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (13 Permission denied)
2007-01-22T07:32:00.000Z	arrenlex	_dd02_	Are you using sudo? Do you have another instance of dpkg\apt\synaptic open?
2007-01-22T07:33:00.000Z	arrenlex	_dd02_	Also, what are you installing?
2007-01-22T07:34:00.000Z	_dd02_	arrenlex	eh not that I know of
2007-01-22T07:34:00.000Z	arrenlex	_dd02_	Whoa, sorry, wpasupplicant was not for you.
2007-01-22T07:34:00.000Z	_dd02_	arrenlex	XD oh no problem
2007-01-22T07:36:00.000Z	arrenlex	_dd02_	Again, you could try installing a newer kernel from edgy. That might detect your card.
2007-01-22T07:37:00.000Z	_dd02_	arrenlex	Thanks for your help - That is exactly what I am doing at this moment. If things don't work out I'll probably be back, but let's hope for the better :)
