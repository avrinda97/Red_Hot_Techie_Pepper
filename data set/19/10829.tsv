2006-05-11T12:26:00.000Z	trnc		how do i get it to run if my machine won't boot from the cd drive
2006-05-11T12:26:00.000Z	soundray	trnc	you should install samba from the repos. Look:
2006-05-11T12:26:00.000Z	soundray		!info samba
2006-05-11T12:26:00.000Z	trnc	soundray	the machine isn't connected to the internet
2006-05-11T12:27:00.000Z	trnc		i need a boot floppy to run the samba install cd
2006-05-11T12:27:00.000Z	soundray	trnc	what a pain... Can't you connect it temporarily somehow?
2006-05-11T12:27:00.000Z	trnc		no way it's not network configured
2006-05-11T12:27:00.000Z	trnc		i remember on other installations rawrite.exe and boot.img
2006-05-11T12:28:00.000Z	trnc		is there any way to make a similar bootdisk on ubuntu?
2006-05-11T12:28:00.000Z	soundray	trnc	yes, look in /install/ on the CD.
2006-05-11T12:28:00.000Z	trnc		ok ty soundray
2006-05-11T12:28:00.000Z	soundray	trnc	it's called smb.img I think... Look:
2006-05-11T12:28:00.000Z	soundray		!smartboot
2006-05-11T12:28:00.000Z	trnc		ty lots soundray
