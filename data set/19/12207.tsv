2006-01-19T08:09:00.000Z	soundray		Can I use Ubuntu to sabotage an annoying neighbor's stereo system?
2006-01-19T08:09:00.000Z	crimsun	soundray	of course. You can also go to jail.
2006-01-19T08:10:00.000Z	soundray	crimsun	I'm almost at the point where I would take that risk.
2006-01-19T08:10:00.000Z	crimsun	soundray	it'd be more polite to ask them to be more considerate
2006-01-19T08:11:00.000Z	soundray	crimsun	what if they open the door for you stoned, spliff in hand, and threaten to attack you?
2006-01-19T08:11:00.000Z	soundray	crimsun	oh, and of course, turn the volume up rather than down...
2006-01-19T08:12:00.000Z	crimsun	soundray	there's always management and/or the cops
2006-01-19T08:13:00.000Z	crimsun	soundray	better directed to #ubuntu-offtopic next time
2006-03-08T07:31:00.000Z	soundray	crimsun	so are ATI and NVidia drivers...
2006-03-08T07:31:00.000Z	crimsun	soundray	ATI and Nvidia provide redistribution allowances in their licenses.
2006-04-01T07:55:00.000Z	soundray	crimsun	you think it's actually a driver bug?
2006-04-01T07:55:00.000Z	crimsun	soundray	no, I'm not entirely convinced it is, but I need a more current testing point.
2006-04-01T07:55:00.000Z	soundray	crimsun	can you send those instructions to me too, please?
2006-04-01T07:57:00.000Z	soundray	crimsun	thank you. I hope you'll be able to help NewbRyan to fix his sound.
2006-05-24T12:02:00.000Z	soundray	crimsun	I see, so in that sense, universe and multiverse are still official.
2006-05-24T12:02:00.000Z	crimsun	soundray	absolutely, since they're components in the official repo
2006-05-31T13:43:00.000Z	crimsun	soundray	there're always UDP, ICMP, SCTP, ...
2006-06-06T15:42:00.000Z	crimsun	soundray	(or in Dapper, /etc/rc.local)
2007-03-22T10:12:00.000Z	soundray	crimsun	are you available to have a look at a sound problem I can't crack (swanyl)
