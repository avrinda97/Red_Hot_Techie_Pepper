2005-09-05T06:37:00.000Z	crimsun	Hurga	breezy or hoary?
2005-09-05T06:41:00.000Z	crimsun	Hurga	did you list the modules necessary in /etc/mkinitrd/modules ?
2005-09-05T06:41:00.000Z	Hurga	crimsun	Yes.
2005-09-05T06:42:00.000Z	crimsun	Hurga	did you modify /etc/mkinitrd/mkinitrd.conf ?
2005-09-05T06:42:00.000Z	Hurga	crimsun	No. Do I need to?
2005-09-05T06:45:00.000Z	Hurga	crimsun	hello?
2005-09-05T06:47:00.000Z	crimsun	Hurga	you shouldn't have to.
2005-09-05T06:48:00.000Z	crimsun	Hurga	what are the contents of /lib/modules/2.6.13/initrd/ ?
2005-09-05T06:48:00.000Z	Hurga	crimsun	There's no initrd directory under /lib/modules/2.6.13
2005-09-05T06:50:00.000Z	crimsun	Hurga	take a look at mkinitrd's man page, then. You can either script the appropriate modules to be copied over using /usr/share/initrd-tools/scripts/$foo, or put a copy of the modules in /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/initrd/
2005-09-05T06:53:00.000Z	Hurga	crimsun	I'm used to Suse and RedHat. They both have mkinitrd which doesn't need any of this. Are you sure it really is that complicated? And why do I have to lst the modules in one file and aditionally copy them somewhere? And why does mkinitrd fail silently?
2005-09-05T06:54:00.000Z	crimsun	Hurga	the man page says that just listing the modules in /etc/mkinitrd/modules does NOT guarantee they'll be included in the initrd image
2005-09-05T06:55:00.000Z	Hurga	crimsun	I don't get ANY initrd image currently.
2005-09-05T06:55:00.000Z	crimsun	Hurga	I understand that
2005-09-05T06:56:00.000Z	crimsun	Hurga	that's why I referred you to some additional gotchas that have plagued people
2005-09-05T06:58:00.000Z	Hurga	crimsun	automatic creation of an initrd when I install a kernel package works fine. can it possibly be THAT broken that nothing works anymore when I ty it manually?
2005-09-05T06:59:00.000Z	crimsun	Hurga	more than likely you're not using a config option/patch that Ubuntu includes
2005-09-05T06:59:00.000Z	crimsun	Hurga	sorry, I need to cut out now
2005-09-05T07:00:00.000Z	Hurga	crimsun	well ok, thanks, trying to copy the modules over.
