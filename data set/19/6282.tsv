2008-02-14T16:57:00.000Z	meekolope		chasosphilipp: run this command
2008-02-14T16:57:00.000Z	meekolope		chasosphilipp: ./shellscript            or               sh shellscript.sh
2008-02-14T16:59:00.000Z	meekolope		i like pidgen
2008-02-14T16:59:00.000Z	meekolope		except the direct connection doesnt ever work right
2008-02-14T16:59:00.000Z	M-Nagato	meekolope	i don't have problems with direct connect
2008-02-14T17:00:00.000Z	M-Nagato		with an older version of it i had to manually fill in my ip for dc and transfers to work, but it doesn't need that anymore
2008-02-14T17:00:00.000Z	meekolope	M-Nagato	really? what about to other users on windoz/aim clients?
2008-02-14T17:00:00.000Z	M-Nagato		the only problem with people using aim is sometimes large pictures get cut in half
2008-02-14T17:00:00.000Z	M-Nagato		but other than that, it works
2008-02-14T17:01:00.000Z	meekolope		hehe
2008-02-14T17:02:00.000Z	meekolope	M-Nagato	mine doesnt like connecting to windows clients or maybe its aol AIM clients
2008-02-14T17:03:00.000Z	M-Nagato	meekolope	hehe. sounds like maybe there are other problems going on then
2008-02-14T17:03:00.000Z	M-Nagato		but i know what you're going through, because a while ago (back when it was still called gaim and before it received the ugly interface it has now), i sometimes had problems connecting to people using AIM
2008-02-14T17:04:00.000Z	meekolope	M-Nagato	perhaps i have an old version? ill look into it some time
