2007-03-16T14:06:00.000Z	bruenig	ep2011	if you used a torrent, the file should be fine
2007-03-16T14:08:00.000Z	bruenig	ep2011	a torrent hash checks every piece, so that file you have should be flawless
2007-03-16T14:09:00.000Z	ep2011	bruenig	- but it isn't, ive downloaded it twice, and burned it on 2 different kinds of media
2007-03-16T14:09:00.000Z	bruenig	ep2011	in fact one of the suggested ways to fix bad downloads, is to simply download the torrent and save it to the same directory so that it will hash check all the pieces and redownload whatever is messed up
2007-03-17T16:29:00.000Z	bruenig	ep2011	files or the OS
2007-03-17T16:30:00.000Z	ep2011	bruenig	Either, really, I don't really care
2007-03-17T16:30:00.000Z	bruenig	ep2011	well I backed up my files and just burned them onto dvds

2007-04-26T06:03:00.000Z	ep2011	bruenig	which codecs would I install for mplayer, it uses xine if im not mistaken, so not the gstreamer codecs?
