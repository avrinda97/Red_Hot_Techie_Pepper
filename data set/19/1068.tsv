2011-08-20T02:31:00.000Z	RA_drc		hi, how do i tell if i have an IDE or SATA hard drive?
2011-08-20T02:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	RA_drc	 look at the connector,
2011-08-20T02:31:00.000Z	RA_drc	Dr_Willis	is there an alternative way?
2011-08-20T02:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	RA_drc	  clarify what you mean.   if you got 2 hds on the table,, the sata hd will have a little plug  anbd the ide will have lots of pins.....
2011-08-20T02:33:00.000Z	RA_drc	Dr_Willis	let's say my hds are not on the table, but in my computer.  is there a command i can use in ubuntu to see what sort of hard drive it is using?
2011-08-20T02:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	RA_drc	 you neglected to mention that little detail, ;0      try the various hwinfo tools i guess like..
2011-09-06T20:21:00.000Z	RA_drc	Dr_Willis	but what you suggested worked, so thanks
2011-09-06T20:11:00.000Z	RA_drc	Dr_Willis	i'm not talking about the global menu, i'm taking about the menu bar for individual applications - i.e., the *top* toolbar like i mentioned earlier.  whether i'm using the calculator, terminal, or document viewer, there is no top menubar available
2011-09-06T20:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	RA_drc	 if the global menu thing some how crashed.. they may not be showing.
2011-09-06T20:11:00.000Z	RA_drc	Dr_Willis	how could i restart it
2011-09-06T20:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	RA_drc	 not sure :) log out/back in perhaps?
2011-09-06T20:12:00.000Z	RA_drc	Dr_Willis	and what do you mean by global menu thing? there's a bar on the left hand side of the screen, and that's working fine
2011-09-06T20:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	RA_drc	 the left side thing is the panel. In unity all the 'menus' are not in th eprograms windows any more. but in the top panel.
2011-09-06T20:14:00.000Z	RA_drc	Dr_Willis	on top of the individual window, not the top of the screen
2011-09-06T20:17:00.000Z	RA_drc	Dr_Willis	the global menu is working fine, it's just that there are no bars on top of the individual windows like there normally would be
2011-09-06T20:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	RA_drc	 you mean the window title bar then....
2011-09-06T20:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	RA_drc	 run 'compiz --replace' if its the title/decorations that are mising. :) or 'metacity --replace'
2011-09-06T20:21:00.000Z	RA_drc	Dr_Willis	no, i meant exactly what i said, not what you thought i meant.  always and exactly.
2011-09-06T20:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	RA_drc	 the 'menubar' is not the 'title bar'
