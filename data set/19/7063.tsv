2007-10-18T10:37:00.000Z	clusty	Blama	most of the power hungy stuff is written by me
2007-10-18T10:38:00.000Z	Blama	clusty	As in you write most of the programs you use that consume a lot of CPU?
2007-10-18T10:39:00.000Z	clusty	Blama	yes
2007-10-18T10:39:00.000Z	clusty	Blama	from time to time i use matlab so i dunno really about that
2007-10-18T10:41:00.000Z	Blama	clusty	MATLAB currently offers a 64bit version, but if that is the only reason I wouldn't bother. I run a 64bit Windows XP and I used to run into a lot of driver problems, but not so much anymore. But I don't see the real reason in upgrading to it...
2007-10-18T10:43:00.000Z	Blama		clust, What are the advantages? High performance platform for the next generation of applications. Windows XP Professional x64 Edition will currently support up to 128 gigabytes (GB) of RAM and 16 terabytes of virtual memory, enabling applications to run faster when working with large data sets. Applications can preload substantially more data into virtual memory, allowing rapid access by the 64-bit processor.
2007-10-18T10:44:00.000Z	clusty		rite
2007-10-18T10:44:00.000Z	clusty		not worth the hassle
2007-10-18T10:44:00.000Z	clusty		the fact of not having the flash plugin available sux in itself
2007-10-18T10:44:00.000Z	Blama	clusty	It isn't, I wish I had a dual-coe processer instead of this 64bit one
2007-10-18T10:45:00.000Z	clusty	Blama	i have dual core
2007-10-18T10:45:00.000Z	clusty	Blama	useless most fo the time
2007-10-18T10:45:00.000Z	clusty	Blama	santa rosa is a bit different though
2007-10-18T10:45:00.000Z	Blama	clusty	I know, but more useful than 64bit
2007-10-18T10:46:00.000Z	Blama	clusty	I am pretty sure I have a flash plugin...
2007-10-18T10:46:00.000Z	clusty	Blama	yeah. you do running 32bit firefox
2007-10-18T10:46:00.000Z	clusty	Blama	thats what i have on school PCs
2007-10-18T10:47:00.000Z	Blama	clusty	hmm, lemme check...
