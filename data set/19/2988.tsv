2012-04-20T00:21:00.000Z	grendal-prime		12.04...seriously...is the software center that dumb?
2012-04-20T00:21:00.000Z	grendal-prime		i need stuff that is not listed in there
2012-04-20T00:21:00.000Z	grendal-prime		do i have to use apt-get again?
2012-04-20T00:21:00.000Z	jrib	grendal-prime	I'm not sure what you are trying to ask, but if you need help with 12.04 please use #ubuntu+1 as it is not released yet
2012-05-09T09:24:00.000Z	jrib	grendal-prime	what's your question?
2012-05-09T09:25:00.000Z	jrib	grendal-prime	well gi is gobject introspection.  But where did you get vedics from?
2012-05-09T09:28:00.000Z	jrib	grendal-prime	well you should start by installing python gobject introspection I suppose.  Are you sure this .deb is meant for your version of ubuntu?
2012-05-09T09:29:00.000Z	jrib	grendal-prime	well can you "import gi" in python?
2012-05-09T09:32:00.000Z	grendal-prime	jrib	ya that didnt do it ither
2012-05-09T09:32:00.000Z	jrib	grendal-prime	what do you mean?  It doesn't do anything.  It gathers information.
2012-05-09T09:32:00.000Z	jrib	grendal-prime	what was the result?
2012-05-09T09:33:00.000Z	jrib	grendal-prime	run "python" first.  Then "import gi"
2012-05-09T09:34:00.000Z	jrib	grendal-prime	now close python (ctrl-d) so you're back at a normal prompt.  What is the result of: readlink -f $(which python)
2012-05-09T09:37:00.000Z	jrib	grendal-prime	are you sure you've installed the correct package for gobject-introspection in lucid?
2012-05-09T09:40:00.000Z	jrib	grendal-prime	well probably the way gobject
2012-05-09T09:40:00.000Z	jrib	grendal-prime	well probably the way gobject-introspection has changed since lucid
2012-05-09T09:41:00.000Z	jrib	grendal-prime	no, I'm telling you that your version of lucid is to old to run that software as is.
2012-05-09T09:42:00.000Z	jrib	grendal-prime	the program you're trying to install expects gobject-introspection that is newer than that provided in lucid (as lucid was released about 2 years ago)
2012-05-09T09:44:00.000Z	jrib	grendal-prime	I don't remember that being the case, but that's what it seems like :?
