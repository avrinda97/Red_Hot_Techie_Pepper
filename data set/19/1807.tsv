2010-10-08T05:44:00.000Z	rambo2_981		say what you want about microsoft, but they do know what they're doing
2010-10-08T05:44:00.000Z	rambo2_981		btw i use ubuntu on every machine i have; but, i have to say (wine is a dog ... i won't change my mind on that) open office doesn't hold a candle to ms office
2010-10-08T05:45:00.000Z	rambo2_981		if you want to run a microsoft app, run it under windows

2010-10-08T05:47:00.000Z	phil_in_london	rambo2_981	you mean keep the same applications open, and roughly in the same spot they were?
2010-10-08T05:47:00.000Z	rambo2_981	phil_in_london	yep
2010-10-08T05:48:00.000Z	phil_in_london	rambo2_981	Menu, System, Preferences, Startup Applications, Options tab.
2010-10-08T05:48:00.000Z	rambo2_981	phil_in_london	ty
2010-10-08T05:48:00.000Z	phil_in_london	rambo2_981	its not perfect, but its as close as you'll get. Some applications don't play by the rules.
2010-10-08T05:49:00.000Z	rambo2_981	phil_in_london	as long as it's close that's fine; thanks
2010-10-08T05:49:00.000Z	phil_in_london	rambo2_981	it will remember which workspace you placed them on as well.
2010-10-08T05:51:00.000Z	rambo2_981	phil_in_london	i haven't really used multiple workspaces, but that's good to know
2010-10-08T05:51:00.000Z	phil_in_london	rambo2_981	handy for those applications that are useless unless they are full screen.
