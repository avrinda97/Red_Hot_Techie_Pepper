2012-09-03T17:33:00.000Z	lordnoid		ive got ubuntu and windows on seperate fakeraid arrays. I can boot to ubuntu, but i cant boot to windows. Grub doesnt see it and i have no idea what the root is supposed to be with names like /dev/mapper/...
2012-09-03T17:33:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	lordnoid	fakeraid is bad, m'kay? Don't use it.
2012-09-03T17:34:00.000Z	lordnoid	Psi-Jack	there's not really another option for dualboot
2012-09-03T17:34:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	lordnoid	Of course there is.
2012-09-03T17:34:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	lordnoid	There's /ALWAYS/ a better option than using fakeraid, 100% of the time.
2012-09-03T17:34:00.000Z	lordnoid	Psi-Jack	tell me
2012-09-03T17:35:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	lordnoid	What's your current raid setup looking like?
2012-09-03T17:35:00.000Z	lordnoid	Psi-Jack	2 raid 0 arrays, 200GB and 1,8TB
2012-09-03T17:36:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	lordnoid	So, 4 HDD's?
2012-09-03T17:36:00.000Z	lordnoid	Psi-Jack	no, 2
2012-09-03T17:37:00.000Z	lordnoid	Psi-Jack	short-stroking
2012-09-03T17:37:00.000Z	lordnoid	Psi-Jack	raid 0 is striping, which is not spanning.
2012-09-03T17:38:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	lordnoid	What's the physical HDD's?
2012-09-03T17:38:00.000Z	lordnoid	Psi-Jack	two 1TB
2012-09-03T17:39:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	lordnoid	Heck, with that, you have 2 HDD's. Use part of 1 to install Linux on, the other to install Windows on, and split the first as needed to share data between the two, if you don't do so with the second one anyway.
2012-09-03T17:40:00.000Z	lordnoid	Psi-Jack	true, but id rather keep my speed
2012-09-03T17:40:00.000Z	lordnoid	Psi-Jack	I am.
2012-09-03T17:40:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	lordnoid	No, really. You're not.
2012-09-03T17:42:00.000Z	lordnoid	Psi-Jack	I've tested it and the tranfer rate was 50MB/s higher
