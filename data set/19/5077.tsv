2009-06-28T16:48:00.000Z	Intrep|d		Actually.. I might as well put Ubuntu desktop .. it's not taht much different than server and the installation is easier and safer for my XP :)
2009-06-28T16:49:00.000Z	Intrep|d		Even ubuntu server?
2009-06-28T16:49:00.000Z	Intrep|d		if it detects it, it doesn't show it anywhere
2009-06-28T16:49:00.000Z	Intrep|d		uname -a
2009-06-28T16:49:00.000Z	Intrep|d		I have XP installed.. nothing more

2009-06-28T16:51:00.000Z	Intrep|d		Nah, the desktop installer is graphical and the other isnt
2009-06-28T16:52:00.000Z	krishmish	Intrep|d	why dont u use a virtual machine???
2009-06-28T16:54:00.000Z	krishmish	Intrep|d	 if u are using a particular OS and wanna use other OS as well without disturbing ur machine...i think VM is the best choice
2009-06-28T16:54:00.000Z	krishmish	Intrep|d	and u can even try the server edition...
2009-06-28T16:55:00.000Z	krishmish	Intrep|d	 wats ur RAM and Processor??
2009-06-28T16:56:00.000Z	krishmish	Intrep|d	try Sun xVM Virtualbox....
2009-06-28T16:56:00.000Z	krishmish	Intrep|d	im using it on a P4 with 2gb and am able to run upto 4 machines without any problem
2009-06-28T16:57:00.000Z	krishmish	Intrep|d	i feel its the cleanest bet
