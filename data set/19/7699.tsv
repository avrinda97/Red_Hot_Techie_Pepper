2007-07-30T16:30:00.000Z	jtong		hi all
2007-07-30T16:31:00.000Z	jtong		what's the package management paradigm in ubuntu? i'm trying to upgrade to vim 7 on my edgy
2007-07-30T16:31:00.000Z	jtong		and it seems the only way for me is to build from source
2007-07-30T16:33:00.000Z	mcphail	jtong	vim7 is in edgy
2007-07-30T16:35:00.000Z	jtong	mcphail	where did u get vim 7 pkg for edgy? i'm using adept but cant find it
2007-07-30T16:35:00.000Z	mcphail	jtong	vim7 is standard in edgy, iirc.
2007-07-30T16:35:00.000Z	mcphail	jtong	dapper was vim6
2007-07-30T16:40:00.000Z	mcphail	jtong	what is the version returned from "apt-cache policy vim"?
2007-07-30T16:41:00.000Z	jtong	mcphail	sorry i'm on dapper
2007-07-30T16:41:00.000Z	mcphail	jtong	if you're on dapper you'll have to compile vim7
2007-07-30T16:42:00.000Z	mcphail	jtong	i may have a "checkinstalled" vim7 lying around somewhere...
2007-07-30T16:42:00.000Z	jtong	mcphail	ok
2007-07-30T16:43:00.000Z	jtong	mcphail	oh ok, i can build from src
2007-07-30T16:43:00.000Z	jtong	mcphail	just didnt feel like breaking the "elegant" package management model
2007-07-30T16:43:00.000Z	mcphail	jtong	ok, if you have probs pm me your email and i'll send the deb. It is 5.8MB
2007-07-30T16:44:00.000Z	jtong	mcphail	 u got the backport?
2007-07-30T16:44:00.000Z	mcphail	jtong	no - i compiled and created a deb with checkinstall
2007-07-30T16:45:00.000Z	jtong	mcphail	ic
2007-07-30T16:45:00.000Z	jtong	mcphail	thanks for the help
