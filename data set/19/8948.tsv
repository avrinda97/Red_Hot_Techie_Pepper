2009-04-16T19:41:00.000Z	Pici	alex1	Then just delete the folder out of ~/.themes or ~/.icons
2009-04-16T19:43:00.000Z	Pici	alex1	Look in ~/.icons and/or ~/.themes
2009-04-16T19:44:00.000Z	Pici	alex1	Are you ignoring me?

2009-04-16T19:47:00.000Z	Pici	alex1	By dragging them onto the appearances window.
2009-04-16T19:47:00.000Z	Pici	alex1	Do you know how to get to ~/.themes ? or do you just not see anything in there?

2009-04-16T19:49:00.000Z	Pici	alex1	How about in ~/.icons ? I don't have graphical access to this computer so I'm not sure if I have any icon themes installed, btu I know my gtk themes are in ~/.themes
2009-04-16T19:50:00.000Z	alex1	Pici	i checked all
2009-04-16T19:50:00.000Z	Pici	alex1	If you know the name of one of the thmes you could try doing: find ~/ -iname "*themename*"
2009-04-16T20:16:00.000Z	Pici	alex1	Don't bait him.
2009-04-16T20:19:00.000Z	alex1	Pici	Pardon
