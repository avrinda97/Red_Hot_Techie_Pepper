2005-11-03T08:26:00.000Z	propagandhi	Xeromem	PC2 is on the same network IP range (ie 192.168.x.x) and the linux box is set as its gateway?
2005-11-03T08:27:00.000Z	propagandhi	Xeromem	and the windows box has 192.168.0.2 as its gateway?

2005-11-03T08:31:00.000Z	propagandhi	Xeromem	so if you can ping the linux box from the windows box, and you have the linux box as your gateway, and u have DNS servers etc, have you tried turning off the firewall in the linux box
2005-11-03T08:32:00.000Z	propagandhi	Xeromem	try stopping it
2005-11-03T08:33:00.000Z	propagandhi	Xeromem	just try with it off
