2008-09-14T22:02:00.000Z	reportingsjr		To use an optical drive, do I only have to mount it?
2008-09-14T22:02:00.000Z	shingouz	reportingsjr	if the system can see it, yes
2008-09-14T22:03:00.000Z	reportingsjr	shingouz	how can I tell if the computer can see it?
2008-09-14T22:04:00.000Z	shingouz	reportingsjr	i would check dmesg for a suitable drive first. hd* or sd* usually
2008-09-14T22:04:00.000Z	reportingsjr	shingouz	huh?
2008-09-14T22:04:00.000Z	shingouz	reportingsjr	try mounting it first :)
2008-09-14T22:05:00.000Z	reportingsjr	shingouz	heh, how do I know what the name of it is?
2008-09-14T22:05:00.000Z	shingouz	reportingsjr	do you see a nice small icon on the desktop somewhere with the name of the disk in the drive?
2008-09-14T22:07:00.000Z	reportingsjr	shingouz	no disk in, I'll grab one though..
2008-09-14T22:08:00.000Z	reportingsjr	shingouz	yeppers, an icon called "Audio CD" just popped up. :)
2008-09-14T22:09:00.000Z	reportingsjr	shingouz	?
2008-09-14T22:10:00.000Z	shingouz	reportingsjr	for audios you usually do not have to even mount them. for data you need to mount unless you have an automounter running there. not sure about how ubuntu does things by default. if that is an audio, try listening to it with your player
2008-09-14T22:12:00.000Z	reportingsjr	shingouz	hmm, yeah. But this is a read/write disk, and I plan to burn some stuff..
2008-09-14T22:14:00.000Z	shingouz	reportingsjr	in that case you should check out the burning software. gnometoaster i think was one. personally i just run mkisofs and wodim on the command line but then again i am on the wrong channel right now :)
2008-09-14T22:14:00.000Z	reportingsjr	shingouz	heh, ok. Thanks!
2008-09-14T22:17:00.000Z	reportingsjr	shingouz	ah, it's gnomebaker
2008-09-14T22:17:00.000Z	shingouz	reportingsjr	something in that style :D
2008-09-14T22:21:00.000Z	reportingsjr	shingouz	ok, I put in a dvd and it shows up on desktop, but I can't view it.
2008-09-14T22:25:00.000Z	shingouz	reportingsjr	and that is a data dvd i presume? mount it
