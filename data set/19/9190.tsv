2007-11-29T20:08:00.000Z	devilsadvocate	n2diy	could you tell me what you want to do..? I've got a networked setup too, maybe i can hep?
2007-11-29T20:10:00.000Z	n2diy	devilsadvocate	I'm trying to rsync this box to my test box, /home/transferred ok, but /etc/ won't: mkstemp errors, permission denied.
2007-11-29T20:15:00.000Z	n2diy	devilsadvocate	If I could open port 22 on my test box, I'd be making progress. I have physical access to it.
2007-11-29T20:16:00.000Z	devilsadvocate	n2diy	the ssh port?
2007-11-29T20:17:00.000Z	n2diy	devilsadvocate	Yes, I suppose, I get the denials with ssh and scp.
2007-11-29T20:17:00.000Z	devilsadvocate	n2diy	aptitude install openssh-server?
2007-11-29T20:19:00.000Z	n2diy	devilsadvocate	the test box doesn' have access to the internet, only to this box, through the lan. I've I could get the test box to access apt's archive on this box, I would be good to go. Or ditto, if I could pass the internet connection through the lan, to the test box.
2007-11-29T20:21:00.000Z	devilsadvocate	n2diy	http-replicator will allow the second comp to connect to the net via the first, and will also avoid downloading the same file twice
2007-11-29T20:22:00.000Z	n2diy	devilsadvocate	that is the trick, the test box can ssh,  and vnc to this box, but this box can't touch the test box. Ok, let me look at http-replicator, thanks.
2007-11-29T20:22:00.000Z	devilsadvocate	n2diy	on our network, we originally sued http replication to increase speed of package downloads.. basicall producing a pratial repo mirro. Later we just started to mirror the whole repo with debmirror
2007-11-29T20:23:00.000Z	devilsadvocate	n2diy	 can youinstall openssh-server on the test box? It should eb possible for it to go both ways, as long as both have the sever
2007-11-29T20:24:00.000Z	devilsadvocate	n2diy	http-replicator is what you want though. but eventually you will end up needing ssh too, so you may want to spend some time trying to fix it
2007-11-29T20:25:00.000Z	n2diy	devilsadvocate	did you pull an all nighter too!? read your last statement! :) I can't install ssh-server on the test box, because this box is denied access to port 22. When I try and rsync the apt-get archives of this box, from the test box, I'm denied permission by mkstemp. I'm in a catch 22.
2007-11-29T20:26:00.000Z	devilsadvocate	n2diy	openssh-server doesnt have many dependancies, if i remeber correctly. use a usb drive :P
2007-11-29T20:27:00.000Z	n2diy	devilsadvocate	that would be a god send, and I'll give it a try now.
2007-11-29T20:27:00.000Z	devilsadvocate	n2diy	download the .deb file and double click on it. It is fundamentally the same as using apt
2007-11-29T20:27:00.000Z	n2diy	devilsadvocate	i already have it here, just have to get it over to the test box.
2007-11-29T20:29:00.000Z	devilsadvocate	n2diy	in case there are unmet dependancies, it will not be able to install. Howveer, it wil tell you what are missing. If there a small number of missing packages, you can get those as well. Install them one at a time. once the dependanceies are installed, runa dpkg-configure -a (or something like that.. taht will be in the error output)
2007-11-29T20:31:00.000Z	n2diy	devilsadvocate	Thanks, I'm familiar with the "dependicies from hell" issues, been playing with linux since RH 5.2, and that is why I love Ubuntu, and Synaptic.
