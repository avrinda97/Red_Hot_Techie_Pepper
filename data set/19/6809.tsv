2007-12-03T06:59:00.000Z	mikeooo		is there a guide for installing the newest intel gma965 x3100 graphics drivers?
2007-12-03T07:00:00.000Z	crdlb	mikeooo	that's not necessary or recommended
2007-12-03T07:00:00.000Z	crdlb	mikeooo	pastebin your /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2007-12-03T07:03:00.000Z	mikeooo	crdlb	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/46649/
2007-12-03T07:04:00.000Z	crdlb	mikeooo	ok you're missing a few lines, so do: sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg
2007-12-03T07:04:00.000Z	mikeooo		should i manually select the intel driver?
2007-12-03T07:04:00.000Z	mikeooo		and i have to kill x before i do that right?
2007-12-03T07:09:00.000Z	mikeooo	crdlb	that didn't fix anything
