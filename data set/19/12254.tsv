2005-12-05T09:46:00.000Z	_jason	theD3viL	actually I lied to you, it plays but doesn't buffer right :/  I've never used mmst:// before, maybe that's why.  What version of firefox are you using?
2005-12-05T09:46:00.000Z	theD3viL	_jason	default ubuntu
2005-12-05T09:50:00.000Z	_jason	theD3viL	I should have also told you I am using a version of the mplayerplugin different than the one in the repos.  But I found that oen to be better than the totem-plugin anyway.
