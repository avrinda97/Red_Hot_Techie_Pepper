2008-07-16T06:05:00.000Z	sparky01		Anyone know the path to the trash bin (gnome trash bin)  some things in there will not delete and it shows as full - permission issue it seems
2008-07-16T06:05:00.000Z	unop	sparky01	~/.local/share/Trash
2008-07-16T06:06:00.000Z	sparky01	unop	Tx
2008-07-16T06:08:00.000Z	sparky01	unop	 Do you know if that is a know bug?
2008-07-16T06:08:00.000Z	unop	sparky01	do i know if what is a known bug? sorry, i'm not following
2008-07-16T06:09:00.000Z	sparky01	unop	it looks to be a bug.  That trash cannot be deleted  in gnome
2008-07-16T06:10:00.000Z	unop	sparky01	can you paste to a pastebin the contents of this command?   cd ~/.local/share/Trash;  ls -ld *
2008-07-16T06:10:00.000Z	unop	sparky01	you probably deleted something using sudo or using nautilus under sudo
2008-07-16T06:13:00.000Z	sparky01	unop	I actually restored some content from a DVD and it had the wrong permissions and got "stuck" in the trash bin.  Shouldn't the normal behavior be that it is deletable. =)
2008-07-16T06:13:00.000Z	unop	sparky01	well, you shouldn't be able to delete files in directories that you don't own
2008-07-16T06:14:00.000Z	unop	sparky01	this is not a bug -- it's just how unix/linux is
2008-07-16T06:14:00.000Z	sparky01	unop	Its files I restored from backup DVD!
2008-07-16T06:16:00.000Z	sparky01	unop	It would be great if it wared you or told you what one might do to solve the problem. =)
2008-07-16T06:16:00.000Z	unop	sparky01	the files probably had permissions set on them -- i dunno, anyway, you got your thing resolved
2008-07-16T06:16:00.000Z	unop	sparky01	perhaps -- but then it is obvious if you get a permissions denied message :)
2008-07-16T06:16:00.000Z	sparky01	unop	yes, I did... Thanks!
2008-07-16T06:17:00.000Z	sparky01	unop	it actually gave NO message
2008-07-16T06:17:00.000Z	sparky01	unop	I figured it out because this is the second time I see the issue
2008-07-16T06:20:00.000Z	unop	sparky01	you top
