2006-04-17T07:18:00.000Z	GuardianAtomos	jStefan	Any clue which ones?
2006-04-17T07:20:00.000Z	GuardianAtomos		Hm. I added the Universe and Multiverse repositories...but I don't see MySQL 5.0 in there still...lemme look again.
2006-04-17T07:21:00.000Z	GuardianAtomos		Okay, lemme try all that.
2006-04-17T07:23:00.000Z	jStefan		the prettiest way is to get a cheap 2nd hard drive
2006-04-17T07:24:00.000Z	jStefan		if you want to be safe, use Backups, or work on a new clean drive
2006-04-17T07:24:00.000Z	GuardianAtomos		Yeah, even with the updated apt-get listings, mysql-4.1 is all I see.
2006-04-17T07:24:00.000Z	GuardianAtomos		Guess I'll have to risk installing it manually.
2006-04-17T07:24:00.000Z	jStefan	GuardianAtomos	MySQL 5.0 is only available for dapper
2006-04-17T07:25:00.000Z	GuardianAtomos	jStefan	Aight...I'll have to go at it manually in that case.
2006-04-17T07:25:00.000Z	jStefan		you would need to check the backports repositories, or install from the MySQL website
2006-04-17T07:25:00.000Z	GuardianAtomos		I need 5.0.
2006-04-17T07:25:00.000Z	GuardianAtomos		bur[n] er, Think so? I can try that. What's the apt-get command to update to Dapper?
2006-04-17T07:26:00.000Z	jStefan		dapper looks very good so far
2006-04-17T07:26:00.000Z	GuardianAtomos		Oops. Sorry...
2006-04-17T07:27:00.000Z	GuardianAtomos		bur[n] er, Thanks.
2006-04-17T07:28:00.000Z	jStefan	GuardianAtomos	i think your options are: going with dapper, install from mysql website
2006-04-17T07:28:00.000Z	GuardianAtomos	jStefan	I'll go with Dapper. :)
2006-04-17T07:28:00.000Z	jStefan		just note it might be easier to go back, with the mysql website option
2006-04-17T07:29:00.000Z	GuardianAtomos	jStefan	Yeah, I realize that. But, I just installed Ubuntu on this system, so if I completely botch everything, that's fine with me.
