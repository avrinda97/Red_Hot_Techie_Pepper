2009-11-09T18:50:00.000Z	trasktrojanek		How can I downgrade to a lower version of notify-osd in Karmic?
2009-11-09T18:51:00.000Z	lupine_85	trasktrojanek	you should be able to install a different major version alongside the minor one. otherwise, if it's still available, apt-get install <package>=<version>
2009-11-09T18:51:00.000Z	lupine_85		s/minor/current/
2009-11-09T18:56:00.000Z	trasktrojanek	lupine_85	do you know how I might find past versions? I'm trying notify-osd=0.9.9-0ubuntu1 and many variations thereof, using the same number, but still can't get it.
2009-11-09T18:56:00.000Z	lupine_85	trasktrojanek	they'll be in previous release package repos
2009-11-09T18:56:00.000Z	lupine_85		you're probably trying to do something broken though
2009-11-09T18:57:00.000Z	lupine_85		hell 'n damnation is very family-friendly... according to the established church ;)
2009-11-09T18:57:00.000Z	lupine_85		but yes, works for me too
2009-11-09T18:58:00.000Z	trasktrojanek	lupine_85	is there a way I can install 0.9.11 from source and not have to remove the karmic version (thus getting rid of ubuntu-desktop, etc.)?
2009-11-09T18:58:00.000Z	lupine_85	trasktrojanek	what's wrong with 0.9.24 ?
2009-11-09T18:59:00.000Z	lupine_85		you /could/ put a different version in /usr/local, but it's probably more trouble than it's worth
2009-11-09T18:59:00.000Z	trasktrojanek	lupine_85	I can't stand the fixed slot-allocation.
2009-11-09T18:59:00.000Z	lupine_85		heh
2009-11-09T18:59:00.000Z	lupine_85		well, if it's for cosmetic reasons, go for it
2009-11-09T19:00:00.000Z	trasktrojanek	lupine_85	how might I "go for it" without breaking ubuntu-desktop, etc.?
2009-11-09T19:00:00.000Z	lupine_85	trasktrojanek	/usr/local is there for you to install whatever you like, so if you're happy to install from source, do so to there
2009-11-09T19:01:00.000Z	lupine_85		/usr/local/bin is before /usr/bin in $PATH, so your custom version will be loaded by default
2009-11-09T19:01:00.000Z	lupine_85		in theroy
2009-11-09T19:01:00.000Z	trasktrojanek	lupine_85	thanks, I'll give it a shot.
