2005-12-09T16:53:00.000Z	nemik	tritium	sorry had an old thing in clipboard
2006-07-06T07:42:00.000Z	tritium	nemik	did you configure your browser to use it?
2006-07-06T07:42:00.000Z	tritium	nemik	(be sure to read the docs in /usr/share/doc/privoxy and tor)

2006-07-06T07:44:00.000Z	tritium	nemik	well, did you configure your browser to use them?
2006-07-06T07:45:00.000Z	nemik	tritium	no, i used the torbutton firefox extension which should do that automatically. but before i tried confing firefox manually also and nothing
2006-07-06T07:45:00.000Z	tritium	nemik	hmm, works here
2006-07-06T07:46:00.000Z	nemik	tritium	if still nothing i'll come back, thank you for the suggestions and help though
2007-10-20T12:19:00.000Z	tritium	nemik	I believe that's affected by locales settings
2007-10-20T12:19:00.000Z	nemik	tritium	so how to change?
2007-10-20T12:20:00.000Z	tritium	nemik	perhaps sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales, but I'm not positive
2007-10-20T12:20:00.000Z	tritium	nemik	also, check your System -> Administration -> Language Support
2007-10-20T12:20:00.000Z	nemik	tritium	thanks i'll see
