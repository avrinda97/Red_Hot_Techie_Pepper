2005-04-20T08:15:00.000Z	pakkiri	thoreauputic	I know but it was a general comment
2005-04-20T08:15:00.000Z	thoreauputic	pakkiri	OK :-)
2005-04-20T08:17:00.000Z	pakkiri	thoreauputic	removing java would just be removing the directories right?
2005-04-20T08:18:00.000Z	thoreauputic	pakkiri	not sure - I've never removed java :)
2005-04-20T08:19:00.000Z	pakkiri	thoreauputic	how do u upgrade?

2005-04-20T08:20:00.000Z	thoreauputic	pakkiri	I don't know - I rarely need java - someone else might know
2005-04-20T08:21:00.000Z	pakkiri	thoreauputic	what do u use?
2005-04-20T08:22:00.000Z	thoreauputic	pakkiri	I have jre 1.5 something here from sun. This is a fairly new install ( a couple of months)
2005-04-20T08:23:00.000Z	thoreauputic	pakkiri	I don't usually bother with java - it's dipensible for me
2005-04-20T08:24:00.000Z	pakkiri	thoreauputic	no I mean what language do u use?
2005-04-20T08:24:00.000Z	thoreauputic	pakkiri	? are you assuming I'm a coder? I write a few little bash scripts, that's all
2005-04-20T08:32:00.000Z	pakkiri	thoreauputic	 I think it must be u ;-)
