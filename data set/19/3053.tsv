2009-11-04T12:29:00.000Z	openweek8		<eL_pSycHo> sorry i got disconnected .. did you find any solution to my problem
2009-11-04T12:30:00.000Z	eL_pSycHo	openweek8	did you try anything?
2009-11-04T12:32:00.000Z	eL_pSycHo	openweek8	try this to generate the xorg.conf    sudo Xorg -configure
2009-11-04T12:34:00.000Z	eL_pSycHo	openweek8	what graphics card do you have and how did you install those drivers in 9.04???
2009-11-04T13:07:00.000Z	eL_pSycHo	openweek8	now you need to copy your new xorg over to the x11 dir... like this..  sudo cp /root/xorg.conf.new /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2009-11-04T13:07:00.000Z	eL_pSycHo	openweek8	but your mouse might not work..... let me see... i dont remember the defaults for mice... maybe someone knows..? ill check in the mean time.
2009-11-04T13:10:00.000Z	eL_pSycHo	openweek8	 its X11 sorry.. capital X
2009-11-04T13:12:00.000Z	eL_pSycHo	openweek8	well.. you could try to start your session now.. but your mouse might not work...  try to see if everything else is and then we'll tackle that.
2009-11-04T13:17:00.000Z	eL_pSycHo	openweek8	what video card do you have? how did you install its drivers while on 9.04?
2009-11-04T13:20:00.000Z	eL_pSycHo	openweek8	please paste the contents of your xorg.conf here http://paste.ubuntu.com
2009-11-04T13:23:00.000Z	eL_pSycHo	openweek8	mipz0r: you could copy your xorg.conf to a flash drive maybe?
2009-11-04T13:32:00.000Z	eL_pSycHo	openweek8	type mount on the terminal is it listed there? it also tells you where it is mounted.
2009-11-04T13:37:00.000Z	eL_pSycHo	openweek8	 i think thats wrong... shouldnt he be doing it in the mount point and no the device???
2009-11-04T13:38:00.000Z	eL_pSycHo	openweek8	mount points are usually under the media folder.
2009-11-04T13:39:00.000Z	eL_pSycHo	openweek8	 what is the mount point for your flash drive???
2009-11-04T13:39:00.000Z	eL_pSycHo	openweek8	then your mount point for that device is /media/Storage
2009-11-04T14:16:00.000Z	eL_pSycHo	openweek8	how is it going? how is your problem?
2009-11-04T14:20:00.000Z	eL_pSycHo	openweek8	 yes.. just copy them from the terminal like you did the xorg.conf file.... remember?
2009-11-04T14:23:00.000Z	eL_pSycHo	openweek8	if you have a flash drive big enough for all your stuff then you can use the terminal to copy all your work to it.. or your whole home folder if you have enough space....
