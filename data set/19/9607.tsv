2006-10-21T07:56:00.000Z	Mad3Max3		if alsa can't find the control IEC958 .. then whats wrong.. tried this amixer set 'IEC958 Playback AC97-SPSA' 0
2006-10-21T07:57:00.000Z	sethk	Mad3Max3	most likely the hardware doesn't support it.
2006-10-21T07:58:00.000Z	sethk	Mad3Max3	possibly the kernel support for it isn't compiled in (or the module isn't loaded).
2006-10-21T07:59:00.000Z	Mad3Max3	sethk	how do I see if the modules is loaded.. and where do I see which modules are loaded?
2006-10-21T08:00:00.000Z	sethk	Mad3Max3	lsmod lists loaded modules
2006-10-21T08:02:00.000Z	Mad3Max3	sethk	it says that the soundcard is loaded.. nothing specific about s-pdif thou..
2006-10-21T08:02:00.000Z	Mad3Max3	sethk	does alsa autodetect stuff like s-pdif .. like on boot and such.
2006-10-21T08:03:00.000Z	sethk	Mad3Max3	ordinarily, yes, but there can always be exceptions.
2006-10-21T08:03:00.000Z	Mad3Max3	sethk	maybe I have to reload something. since I installed the s-pdif bracket afterwards
2006-10-21T08:04:00.000Z	sethk	Mad3Max3	possible, yes.  there is a dpkg-reconfigure command you can run.
2006-10-21T08:05:00.000Z	Mad3Max3	sethk	just type dpkg-reconfigure in terminal and enter?
2006-10-21T08:06:00.000Z	sethk	Mad3Max3	no, we need the package name to reconfigure
2006-10-21T08:06:00.000Z	Mad3Max3	sethk	is it the alsa-mixer or alsa something?
2006-10-21T08:07:00.000Z	sethk	Mad3Max3	no, the mixer uses it, but the mixer is just an app
2006-10-21T08:09:00.000Z	Mad3Max3	sethk	maybe alsa-base?
2006-10-21T08:13:00.000Z	sethk	Mad3Max3	could be any of the alsa packages.  check for an audio howto, it might not address your specific issue, but it will certainly tell you in general the way to reconfigure.
2006-10-21T08:14:00.000Z	Mad3Max3	sethk	, ok
2006-10-21T08:26:00.000Z	Mad3Max3	sethk	when I type the aplay -l ... I only get up Analog.. no digital.. is it that digital istn't enabled and thats why alsa can't find my spdif?
2006-10-21T08:27:00.000Z	Mad3Max3	sethk	I get .. card 0: NVidia [HDA NVidia] , device 0: ALC880 Analog [ALC880 Analog]
