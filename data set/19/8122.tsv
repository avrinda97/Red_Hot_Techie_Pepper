2007-05-02T07:45:00.000Z	ubba		I thought that is what it is used for...wow okay I guess not
2007-05-02T07:46:00.000Z	ubba		Is there any way I can save something to a partition in ubuntu and execute it in windows
2007-05-02T07:47:00.000Z	mlalkaka	ubba	what do you mean by "execute"?
2007-05-02T07:48:00.000Z	ubba	mlalkaka	I want to be able to use a program I download in ubuntu, in windows
2007-05-02T07:48:00.000Z	mlalkaka	ubba	is it a windows executable?
2007-05-02T07:49:00.000Z	ubba	mlalkaka	yes, it is a driver for the wireless card in my laptop
2007-05-02T07:50:00.000Z	mlalkaka	ubba	you have two options. can you currently access your windows partition from ubuntu?
2007-05-02T07:51:00.000Z	ubba	mlalkaka	no, I don't think I can
2007-05-02T07:51:00.000Z	ubba	mlalkaka	it isn't displayed on my ubuntu desktop so I dont think I can
2007-05-02T07:52:00.000Z	mlalkaka	ubba	ok. well like peepsalot said, you can access your ext3 filesystem from windows by installing a program that you can download from http://www.fs-driver.org. install that program under windows.
2007-05-02T07:52:00.000Z	mlalkaka	ubba	but you said you were trying to install a wifi driver for windows right? then you probably can't download anything from fs-driver.org.
2007-05-02T07:53:00.000Z	ubba	mlalkaka	it says that is for ext2 filesystems, will it still work on my ext3?
2007-05-02T07:54:00.000Z	mlalkaka	ubba	yes. ext3 is identical to ext2 except that it has what's known as a journal, which ensures that writing to the disk is safe even if it is interrupted part-way through.
2007-05-02T07:55:00.000Z	mlalkaka	ubba	the other option is to mount your windows partition under linux.
2007-05-02T07:55:00.000Z	ubba	mlalkaka	fs-driver.org?
2007-05-02T07:56:00.000Z	mlalkaka	ubba	that's right: www.fs-driver.org
2007-05-02T07:57:00.000Z	ubba	mlalkaka	so that program is executed in windows?
2007-05-02T07:58:00.000Z	ubba	mlalkaka	i'll give it a try, thanks for your help
2007-05-02T08:00:00.000Z	mlalkaka	ubba	After you install the program from www.fs-driver.org. You can mount your linux partition under windows. That is, you will be able to access all the files on your GNU/Linux partition from My Computer under Windows (there will be another drive there, such as H: drive or something). So if you saved the desired files in some part of your Linux partition, you can access that file through a drive in My Computer in Windows. Optional
