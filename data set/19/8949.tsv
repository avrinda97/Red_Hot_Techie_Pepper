2007-12-27T18:35:00.000Z	Onyx		When I try to install new programs with Ubuntu's "Add/Remove...", it just hangs and displays the spinning cursor indefinitely...  anyone else have this problem?
2007-12-27T18:35:00.000Z	Onyx		This is really annoying...
2007-12-27T18:36:00.000Z	Pici	Onyx	Can you open a terminal  and type `sudo apt-get update`  (w/o quotes)
2007-12-27T18:36:00.000Z	Onyx	Pici	Done... now try again?
2007-12-27T18:36:00.000Z	Pici	Onyx	Did you get any errors?
2007-12-27T18:36:00.000Z	Onyx	Pici	No
2007-12-27T18:37:00.000Z	Onyx	Pici	Ran straight through
2007-12-27T18:37:00.000Z	Pici	Onyx	Try add/remove again then
2007-12-27T18:38:00.000Z	Onyx	Pici	Same deal.  The "Starting Administrative...." process starts running in the background (icon on the taskbar), then it disappears and the add/remove program hangs.
2007-12-27T18:39:00.000Z	Pici	Onyx	let me check something hewre, hold on
2007-12-27T18:40:00.000Z	Pici	Onyx	Run `gksudo gnome-app-install`
2007-12-27T18:41:00.000Z	Pici	Onyx	From a terminal and look for errors
2007-12-27T18:42:00.000Z	Onyx	Pici	Odd... that worked without any errors whatsoever.
2007-12-27T18:43:00.000Z	Pici	Onyx	Very odd.
2007-12-27T18:47:00.000Z	Onyx	Pici	Is there any danger of editing my Applications menu to execute 'gksudo' prior to '/usr/sbin/gnome-app-install'... so the entry would be 'gksudo /usr/bin/gnome-app-install'
2007-12-27T18:48:00.000Z	Pici	Onyx	Not at all, but the program should have automatically called it itself.
2007-12-27T20:41:00.000Z	Pici	Onyx	Emerald themes are only for the window borders, GTK themes apply to the scroll bars, buttons, etc.
2007-12-27T20:41:00.000Z	Onyx	Pici	Ahhh okay, I was under the impression that GTK+
2007-12-27T20:42:00.000Z	Pici	Onyx	Perhaps you were thinking of Metacity and emerald
