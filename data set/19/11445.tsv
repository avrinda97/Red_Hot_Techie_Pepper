2006-01-19T16:31:00.000Z	Martini		I have 3COM ISA Network card. My Ubuntu (Breezy Badger) doesn' t find it. HOW CAN I INSTALL IT? Is it needed a driver?
2006-01-19T16:31:00.000Z	crimsun	Martini	WHICH 3com card? And stop using caps for the love of all that's holy.
2006-01-19T16:34:00.000Z	Martini	crimsun	I have 3Com Etherlink II ISA
2006-01-19T16:35:00.000Z	crimsun	Martini	sudo modprobe 3c503
2006-01-19T16:40:00.000Z	Martini	crimsun	my result is - No such device or address
2006-01-19T16:41:00.000Z	crimsun	Martini	from the modprobe?
2006-01-19T16:41:00.000Z	Martini	crimsun	maybe I should install ISApnptools?
2006-01-19T16:41:00.000Z	crimsun	Martini	you're positive it's a II and not a III?
2006-01-19T16:41:00.000Z	Martini	crimsun	Yes
2006-01-19T16:42:00.000Z	Martini	crimsun	I think yes but what should I modprobe if it's a III?
2006-01-19T16:43:00.000Z	crimsun	Martini	3c509
2006-01-19T16:48:00.000Z	Martini	crimsun	Thank you ever so much. A few letters and ISA appears. I owe you a beer!
2006-01-19T16:48:00.000Z	crimsun	Martini	so it /is/ a III?
2006-01-19T16:49:00.000Z	Martini	crimsun	I think so because now it's working
2006-01-19T16:49:00.000Z	crimsun	Martini	heh, thought so. IIs are fairly rare these days.
2006-01-19T16:52:00.000Z	Martini	crimsun	It seems all ISA cards are rare used nowadays. At least I think so.
2006-01-19T16:52:00.000Z	crimsun	Martini	I still use a slew of IIIs
2006-01-19T16:55:00.000Z	Martini	crimsun	Minus for ISA is that it' s slow - only 10 Mbps
2006-01-20T17:11:00.000Z	crimsun	Martini	it could be simplified, sure
