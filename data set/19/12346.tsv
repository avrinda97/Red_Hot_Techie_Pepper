2005-09-17T16:43:00.000Z	galorin		I'm fairly new to Ubuntu.  I've just installed it on my laptop, but am having trouble with my Netgear MA111 (prinm2 chipset).  I installed the linux-wlan-ng package, but when plugging in the dongle, and typing iwconfig, it says "wlan0 no wireless extensions"  What more do I need to do?
2005-09-17T16:43:00.000Z	bob2	galorin	it uses it's own magic tools
2005-09-17T16:43:00.000Z	bob2	galorin	wlan-ng-ctl or something
2005-09-17T16:44:00.000Z	bob2	galorin	sudo wlanctl-ng wlan0 lnxreq_autojoin ssid="blah" authtype=opensystem
2005-09-17T16:44:00.000Z	bob2	galorin	after 'sudo wlanctl-ng wlan0 lnxreq_ifstate ifstate=enable'
2005-09-17T16:48:00.000Z	galorin	bob2	now it's saying no such device..
2005-09-17T16:48:00.000Z	bob2	galorin	perhaps there isn't
2005-09-17T16:48:00.000Z	bob2	galorin	they're really terrible devices, and need to be reset often
2005-09-17T16:48:00.000Z	bob2	galorin	sudo rmmod prism2_usb ; sudo modprobe prism2_usb prism2_doreset=1
2005-09-17T16:49:00.000Z	galorin	bob2	only one I've got LOL.  I'll try that
2005-09-17T16:49:00.000Z	bob2	galorin	it's all I had for a long time, too
2005-09-17T16:51:00.000Z	galorin	bob2	looks like prism2 isn't being associated with the wlan0 device.  Time to chek a few config files
2005-09-17T16:51:00.000Z	bob2	galorin	remember that iwconfig will never work for you
2005-09-17T16:52:00.000Z	bob2	galorin	look at dmesg
2005-09-17T16:53:00.000Z	galorin	bob2	I just checked dmesg, and that's how I knew. I got it working under Slackware with ndiswrapper, but I demo linux on this laptop.
2005-09-17T16:53:00.000Z	bob2	galorin	what does dmesg say?
2005-09-17T16:56:00.000Z	galorin	bob2	prism2usb_init:prism2_usb.o loaded, dev info is:prsm2_usb, something about corereset not supported on 2.5/2.6 kernel, then usbcore regestiring new driver.  No mention of device wlan0
2005-09-17T16:56:00.000Z	bob2	galorin	that's not surprising
2005-09-17T05:01:00.000Z	galorin	bob2	thanks for that bit, I'll keep pressing on
