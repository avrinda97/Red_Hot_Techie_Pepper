2009-06-15T19:06:00.000Z	AceKing		Anyone know of a tool to secure erase a hard drive?
2009-06-15T19:08:00.000Z	erUSUL	AceKing	usually just zeroing it is enough... « dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdx »
2009-06-15T19:09:00.000Z	AceKing	erUSUL	I am kind of new to Ubuntu, is that a command in terminal?
2009-06-15T19:10:00.000Z	erUSUL	AceKing	yes... you have to find out wch /dev/sdx is the hard drive you want to zero
2010-01-12T17:31:00.000Z	erUSUL	AceKing	you can check what filesystem is mounted as ---> cat /proc/mounts
2010-01-12T17:32:00.000Z	AceKing	erUSUL	Thanks
2010-01-12T17:38:00.000Z	AceKing	erUSUL	I ran cat /proc/mounts but it didn't give me a list of all drives mounted
2010-01-12T17:38:00.000Z	erUSUL	AceKing	if it is not there it is not mounted
