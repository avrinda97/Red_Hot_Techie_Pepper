2008-12-08T09:34:00.000Z	Hasbro		Hey
2008-12-08T09:35:00.000Z	Hasbro		If I want something to start with Ubuntu, can I add the .sh file to the Init folder and it'll auto start?
2008-12-08T09:36:00.000Z	Hasbro		Any ideas?
2008-12-08T09:36:00.000Z	Hasbro		startup
2008-12-08T09:36:00.000Z	Hasbro		It's on my server
2008-12-08T09:36:00.000Z	Hasbro		remotly
2008-12-08T09:37:00.000Z	Hasbro		I'm doing it via ssh soo :P
2008-12-08T09:37:00.000Z	Hasbro		Well, that's what I want to stop heh
2008-12-08T09:37:00.000Z	Hasbro		I'd rather it do it automatically
2008-12-08T09:37:00.000Z	usser	Hasbro	add the line calling the script to /etc/rc.local
2008-12-08T09:39:00.000Z	usser	Hasbro	it runs the script on startup, only when u boot into multiuser mode though, which should be default anyhow
2008-12-08T09:39:00.000Z	usser	Hasbro	its for user's scripts
2008-12-08T09:39:00.000Z	usser	Hasbro	all system scripts are in /etc/init.d
2008-12-08T09:40:00.000Z	usser	Hasbro	you can add yours too but its more complicated
2008-12-08T09:40:00.000Z	usser	Hasbro	they have to have a special format etc.
2008-12-08T09:42:00.000Z	usser	Hasbro	there was a skeleton  file in /etc/init.d last i remember
2008-12-08T09:42:00.000Z	usser	Hasbro	basically script has to accept parameters - start, stop, restart
2008-12-08T09:43:00.000Z	usser	Hasbro	when its run your script must check its input and execute different actions based on it
2008-12-08T09:44:00.000Z	usser	Hasbro	also man update-rc.d
