2009-02-12T14:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	surjeet	then run: sudo apt-get install wine
2009-02-12T14:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	surjeet	then download the trial and launch the setup.exe (or whatever it is) with wine

2009-02-12T14:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	surjeet	then open the setup file with wine and the system will install if it is able
2009-02-12T14:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	surjeet	right click -> open with wine
2009-02-12T14:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	surjeet	or in terminal: wine /path/to/setup.exe
