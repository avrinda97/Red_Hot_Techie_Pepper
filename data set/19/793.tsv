2011-09-17T00:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	alkafoo	she also said it breaks things
2011-09-17T00:14:00.000Z	alkafoo	ActionParsnip	it said it breaks Unity, which presumably someone wanting ordinary GNOME3 won't want
2011-09-18T01:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	alkafoo	http://home.mayn.de/comrad/freecnc/
2011-09-18T01:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	alkafoo	http://www.boswars.org/  seems the other project is dead afaics
2012-01-05T08:14:00.000Z	alkafoo	ActionParsnip	probably fewer issues than identity theft, etc.
2012-01-05T08:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	alkafoo	never had that happen
2012-01-05T08:15:00.000Z	alkafoo	ActionParsnip	then it cannot possibly happen to anyone =P
2012-01-05T08:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	alkafoo	but the number of people in here and alll the other support places where folks have to help people decrypt their data is so huge
2012-01-05T08:16:00.000Z	alkafoo	ActionParsnip	yes, but the number of people everywhere who can barely spell their own names is huge
2012-01-05T08:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	alkafoo	it takes time and explaining, and if you remmeber the target audience of ubuntu, you can imagine how fun that is
2012-01-05T08:16:00.000Z	alkafoo	ActionParsnip	super mega fun =P
2012-01-05T08:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	alkafoo	exactly so I don't bother
2012-01-05T08:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	alkafoo	in short, its a pain in the ass for not much gain imho
2012-01-05T08:18:00.000Z	alkafoo	ActionParsnip	yes, but probably not as much as getting your laptop stolen with all your personal data on it, unencrypted
2012-01-05T08:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	alkafoo	thats why you look after your stuff
2012-01-05T08:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	alkafoo	or use cloud based stuff, then there is nothing on the system
2012-01-05T08:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	alkafoo	works great here
2012-01-05T08:20:00.000Z	alkafoo	ActionParsnip	lies!
2012-01-05T08:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	alkafoo	personal corp clouds are great, try it
