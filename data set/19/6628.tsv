2008-06-17T13:45:00.000Z	darkstar		hi guys. anyone experiencing OOffice not to start at all in HH?
2008-06-17T13:47:00.000Z	darkstar		My OOffice DOES NOT start at all in HH?
2008-06-17T13:48:00.000Z	Starnestommy	darkstar	run 'openoffice' in a terminal and see what happens
2008-06-17T13:50:00.000Z	darkstar	Starnestommy	it freezes at the splash screen..
2008-06-17T13:51:00.000Z	Starnestommy	darkstar	do you see any errors in the terminal?
2008-06-17T13:52:00.000Z	darkstar	Starnestommy	it complains about some missing images in pixmap_path but nothing seriuos.... It does NOT load any document...
2008-06-17T13:52:00.000Z	Starnestommy	darkstar	pastebin the errors
2008-06-17T13:54:00.000Z	darkstar	Starnestommy	http://paste.ubuntu.com/20805/
2008-06-17T13:56:00.000Z	darkstar	Starnestommy	I am going crazy: This was a clena install and it never worked. So I thought I had some corrupted packages on my cd. I removed them all and installed from the repositories but still...
2008-06-17T13:56:00.000Z	Starnestommy	darkstar	does 'openoffice -minimized' work?
2008-06-17T13:56:00.000Z	darkstar	Starnestommy	let me go see...
2008-06-17T13:57:00.000Z	darkstar	Starnestommy	the cmd line output is null... what shoud happen when launching it with -minimized?
2008-06-17T13:58:00.000Z	Starnestommy	darkstar	does it load at all, or does it still do nothing?
2008-06-17T13:58:00.000Z	darkstar	Starnestommy	as I said the outputr from cmdline is null i can check ps -A if it's running or not BRB

2008-06-17T14:07:00.000Z	darkstar	Starnestommy	Can you suggest a workaround? I've already completely removed and reinstalled all OOffice packages but it keeps freezing.
2008-06-17T14:08:00.000Z	Starnestommy	darkstar	I'm not sure.  I've never had that problem, although I've stuck with 7.10 instead of upgrading to 8.04
2008-06-17T14:09:00.000Z	darkstar	Starnestommy	I am sure u've done the right thing.. Since my move to 8.04 I have discovered lots of problems.. Feisty was much more reliable.....
2008-06-17T14:38:00.000Z	darkstar	Starnestommy	I have removed all openoffice-org2 configuration files from my home directory and it now works :)
