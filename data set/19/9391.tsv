2007-01-28T14:36:00.000Z	blind_		Anyone know anything about using phones as tethered modems in linux?
2007-01-28T14:37:00.000Z	bulmer	blind_	its been a while...do you actually have a analog modem on your cellphone?
2007-01-28T14:38:00.000Z	blind_	bulmer	it works off the highspeed network, it works nicely and i get good speeds.. my wireless modem just crapped out on me, so it's kind of a necessity
2007-01-28T14:39:00.000Z	blind_	bulmer	I'm just not quite sure how to go about using it in linux.
2007-01-28T14:40:00.000Z	bulmer	blind_	let me put it differently, do you get like isdn off of your phone or a tethered analog modem is attached to your cellphone? i wanted to clarify first
2007-01-28T14:41:00.000Z	blind_	bulmer	no, i dial #777 on the phone, and it connects to their data servers, not like dialing a NetZero number or anything.
2007-01-28T14:42:00.000Z	blind_	bulmer	kinda like using the internet ON the phone, except through the computer.
2007-01-28T14:43:00.000Z	bulmer	blind_	ahh, okay, i have not used that service, but I assume the ISP/cellfone company has a server you need to log-on to before allowing your data through?
2007-01-28T14:43:00.000Z	blind_	bulmer	i think i found some good information, im gonna go downstairs and try it out, PM me if you have anything to say.
2007-01-28T14:43:00.000Z	bulmer	blind_	you probably looking at ppp
2007-01-28T14:44:00.000Z	blind_	bulmer	yeah, definitely PPP
2007-01-28T14:44:00.000Z	bulmer	blind_	you may have to check with your isp provider how to logon first
2007-01-28T15:02:00.000Z	blind_	bulmer	i have the login details, i can't actually get the phone to dial out is the problem
2007-01-28T15:03:00.000Z	bulmer	blind_	one thing to be concerned too is, are those synchronous or asynchronous data.. it can make a difference on how ppp initial interaction with the isp
2007-01-28T15:03:00.000Z	blind_	bulmer	I'm pretty sure it's async
2007-01-28T15:04:00.000Z	bulmer	blind_	but ppp is synchronous, so ppp has to get into like  Hayes modem AT command mode then switch to synch mode
2007-01-28T15:05:00.000Z	blind_	bulmer	no clue how to do that?
2007-01-28T15:06:00.000Z	bulmer	blind_	am not sure how to do that dialing part ..has to be asynch or if synch, the clocking coming off the modem in your phone has to beat exactly at correct speeds
2007-01-28T15:13:00.000Z	bulmer	blind_	i noticed Ubuntu does not have setserial command
