2005-03-10T11:47:00.000Z	MyNameIsChris		Is it normal for cpu load to always be at 100%, in Fedora it sat at 3% all the time
2005-03-10T11:47:00.000Z	bob2	MyNameIsChris	what does 'top' say is using all the cpu?
2005-03-10T11:50:00.000Z	bob2	MyNameIsChris	it was open, but perhaps not visible
2005-03-21T11:32:00.000Z	bob2	MyNameIsChris	"can't be seen"?  are you sure you have build-essential installed?
2005-03-21T11:33:00.000Z	MyNameIsChris	bob2	I have everything in the prerequisites. I have not installed build-essential
2005-03-21T11:34:00.000Z	MyNameIsChris	bob2	Now I do
2005-03-21T11:34:00.000Z	bob2	MyNameIsChris	then 'which gcc' prints what?
2005-03-21T11:35:00.000Z	MyNameIsChris	bob2	gcc works now, it was unknown before. I thought build-essentials was a download
2005-03-21T11:37:00.000Z	bob2	MyNameIsChris	yes, so you didn't have build-essential's prerequisites installed, you had some other packages which it doesn't care about
2005-03-21T11:37:00.000Z	bob2	MyNameIsChris	er
2005-03-21T11:37:00.000Z	bob2	MyNameIsChris	you know all that package does is produce a .deb of your kernel, right?
2005-03-21T11:40:00.000Z	bob2	MyNameIsChris	libncurses5-dev
2005-03-21T11:46:00.000Z	bob2	MyNameIsChris	/boot/
2005-03-21T11:47:00.000Z	bob2	MyNameIsChris	why are you buliding a new kernel to begin with?
2005-03-21T11:50:00.000Z	MyNameIsChris	bob2	I was going to examine the bloatedness of my current one and determine if I am going to build my own
2005-03-21T11:50:00.000Z	bob2	MyNameIsChris	no, there's no point at all
2005-06-13T16:51:00.000Z	bob2	MyNameIsChris	http://packages.ubuntu.com/xserver-xorg
2005-06-13T16:53:00.000Z	bob2	MyNameIsChris	wiki.ubuntu.com/BinaryDriverHowto
2005-06-13T16:53:00.000Z	MyNameIsChris	bob2	my own kernel. Sorry and Thanks
