2010-02-27T02:36:00.000Z	Lenin_Cat	GeekSquid	im trying to restore grub after reinstalling windows 7 from a live cd
2010-02-27T02:37:00.000Z	Lenin_Cat	GeekSquid	Ive read it
2010-02-27T02:38:00.000Z	GeekSquid	Lenin_Cat	it is better to install Windows 7 first ... then install Ubuntu, the other way around can be a major headache
2010-02-27T02:39:00.000Z	Lenin_Cat	GeekSquid	I was reinstalling it because windows got messed up
2010-02-27T02:41:00.000Z	Lenin_Cat	GeekSquid	so what do I do :<
2010-02-27T02:41:00.000Z	GeekSquid	Lenin_Cat	yes, use live cd to reinstall grub - following instructions of course
2010-02-27T02:42:00.000Z	Lenin_Cat	GeekSquid	I tryed that
2010-02-27T02:43:00.000Z	GeekSquid	Lenin_Cat	GRUB support in #grub .... /join #grub

2010-02-27T02:51:00.000Z	GeekSquid	Lenin_Cat	Looking at that, ... did you previously upgrade your ubuntu version?
2010-02-27T02:52:00.000Z	Lenin_Cat	GeekSquid	no fresh install
2010-03-01T08:26:00.000Z	GeekSquid	Lenin_Cat	it is sudo dpkg-reconfigure
2010-03-01T08:27:00.000Z	Lenin_Cat	GeekSquid	/usr/sbin/dpkg-reconfigure: pgf is broken or not fully installed
