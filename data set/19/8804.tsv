2007-02-05T13:47:00.000Z	imbecile		hey guys, are there any disadvantages from installing packages from the web? http://packages.ubuntu.com/dapper/  it tells me i should install from "software channel"
2007-02-05T13:48:00.000Z	cables	imbecile	even better, use "sudo aptitude install <packagename>
2007-02-05T13:49:00.000Z	cables	imbecile	open a terminal via Applications>Accessories>Terminal, and use the command "sudo aptitude install PACKAGENAME"
2007-02-05T13:51:00.000Z	cables	imbecile	it won't get updated automatically, you won't get dependencies, and it takes more work to do it from the web. If you want something similar to the web interface packages.ubuntu.com has, go to System>Administration>Synaptic Package Manager
2007-02-05T13:53:00.000Z	cables	imbecile	or go to System>Administration>Synaptic Package Manager
2007-02-05T13:53:00.000Z	cables	imbecile	that's a graphical way to both search for AND install packages
2007-02-05T13:53:00.000Z	imbecile	cables	some of the stuff i look for doesnt come up in my synaptic
2007-02-05T13:54:00.000Z	cables	imbecile	that's because you don't have all the repositories enabled. I'll send a link in one second. If it doesn't show up in Synaptic, you won't be able to install from the terminal.
2007-02-05T13:55:00.000Z	imbecile	cables	i have universe and multiverse is that what you are talking about?
2007-02-05T13:55:00.000Z	cables	imbecile	click Refresh in Synaptic and see if anything else shows up
2007-02-05T13:55:00.000Z	cables	imbecile	my bad... reload.
2007-02-05T13:56:00.000Z	cables	imbecile	how does it look different?
2007-02-05T13:57:00.000Z	imbecile	cables	i have a colored icons and stuff
2007-02-05T13:57:00.000Z	cables	imbecile	I think you're in Add/Remove, not Synaptic
2007-02-05T13:59:00.000Z	imbecile	cables	i think youre right ;P
2007-02-05T14:00:00.000Z	cables	imbecile	go to where I told you... if you go to the real Synaptic, you'll be able to install all packages you have repositories for. If you haven't enabled multiverse and universe, go here for a guide: http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_dapper#How_to_apt-get_the_easy_way_.28Synaptic.29
2007-05-08T15:18:00.000Z	cables	imbecile	are you using effects?
2007-05-08T15:18:00.000Z	imbecile	cables	yes beryl
2007-05-21T07:53:00.000Z	cables	imbecile	/boot/grub/menu.lst as in Lst :)
