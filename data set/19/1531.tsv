2011-01-01T21:21:00.000Z	shinzu		Hi, I'm having problems configuring shares between ubuntu a windows, could anyone help?. I'm getting "Host seems to be down" but when I ping the windows box, it's returning packets
2011-01-01T21:23:00.000Z	sacarlson	shinzu	maybe try install winbind package
2011-01-01T21:24:00.000Z	shinzu	sacarlson	let me check that out
2011-01-01T21:27:00.000Z	shinzu	sacarlson	I have no idea what to do with that package
2011-01-01T21:27:00.000Z	sacarlson	shinzu	I thought all you had to do is install it?
2011-01-01T21:28:00.000Z	sacarlson	shinzu	do you use synaptic?
2011-01-01T21:28:00.000Z	shinzu	sacarlson	I still get host down. By the way, I disabled the firewall on my windows box
2011-01-01T21:28:00.000Z	shinzu	sacarlson	I used aptitude
2011-01-01T21:28:00.000Z	sacarlson	shinzu	that should be fine
2011-01-01T21:29:00.000Z	shinzu	sacarlson	Still getting host down when I try to mount it, any ideas?
2011-01-01T21:30:00.000Z	sacarlson	shinzu	well winbind will only help ubuntu find the windows box.  when I have tried to connect to windows xp I need to have a windows account with a password to get it to work
2011-01-01T21:31:00.000Z	shinzu	sacarlson	I do have the credentials, how do you connect to it
2011-01-01T21:31:00.000Z	sacarlson	shinzu	are you shareing the files from the windows account with the password?
2011-01-01T21:32:00.000Z	shinzu	sacarlson	yes
2011-01-01T21:32:00.000Z	sacarlson	shinzu	well I'm not a windows guy,  I share my files for windows users on my ubuntu
2011-01-01T21:32:00.000Z	shinzu	sacarlson	Oh ok, thanks for the help anyway!
2011-01-01T21:33:00.000Z	sacarlson	shinzu	I've had too many problems like you now have, and it has gotten worse in vista and win 7
2011-01-01T21:41:00.000Z	sacarlson	shinzu	after all that I missed what version the windows side is?
2011-01-01T21:42:00.000Z	shinzu	sacarlson	Windows Xp =)
