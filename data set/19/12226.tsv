2006-08-25T12:43:00.000Z	lightstar	byen	you can try to tail your system logs in  /var/log.. see whats causing it
2006-08-25T12:46:00.000Z	byen	lightstar	i see something like Aug 24 22:28:33 localhost -- MARK --
2006-08-25T12:46:00.000Z	byen		many times
2006-08-25T12:46:00.000Z	byen		what does that mean?
2006-08-25T12:48:00.000Z	lightstar	byen	hang on
2006-08-25T12:49:00.000Z	lightstar	byen	run this command gnome-system-log
2006-08-25T12:50:00.000Z	lightstar	byen	then check the log to see any error around the time your pc hung
2006-08-25T12:50:00.000Z	byen	lightstar	its empty
2006-08-25T12:51:00.000Z	lightstar	byen	you need to open the lg files using it:)
2006-08-25T12:51:00.000Z	byen		ok.. i loaded system log
2006-08-25T12:52:00.000Z	lightstar	byen	try opening syslog..it'd b more helpful
2006-08-25T12:53:00.000Z	byen	lightstar	im lost... the last thing i reinstalled was the latest update
2006-08-25T12:53:00.000Z	lightstar	byen	that's strange..what update did you install?
2006-08-25T12:53:00.000Z	byen		the latest xserver
2006-08-25T12:54:00.000Z	byen		the updated one
2006-08-25T12:54:00.000Z	byen		and the murrine engine lightstar
2006-08-25T12:54:00.000Z	byen		could be the engine
2006-08-25T12:55:00.000Z	lightstar	byen	not too sure...the syslog will be helpful in trying to figure out the cause..you just have to go through the log
