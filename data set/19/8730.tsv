2007-07-13T12:24:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	cotyrothery	i'm pretty sure you update your bios in U buntu, the same way you do w/ windows, but 've not flashed my bios ever, in about 3yrs
2007-07-13T12:24:00.000Z	cotyrothery	IndyGunFreak	so were and how would i do this
2007-07-13T12:25:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	cotyrothery	well, first and foremost, why?... its a fairly risky procedure, so if you don't need to do it, i wouldn't bother
2007-07-13T12:26:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	cotyrothery	that really has nothing to do with it, you need the make/model # of your motherboard.
2007-07-13T12:26:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	cotyrothery	why are you wanting to updating your BIOS?
2007-07-13T12:27:00.000Z	cotyrothery	IndyGunFreak	because im not able to boot from usb without it
2007-07-13T12:27:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	cotyrothery	i'm just saying, flashing the bios, if something gos wrong, can be a gigantic pain the ass to fix, so if you don't absolutely have to do it, i wouldn't.
2007-07-13T12:28:00.000Z	cotyrothery	IndyGunFreak	well either way i am planing on buying  a new mobo
2007-07-13T12:28:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	cotyrothery	well, proceed at your own risk, but my guess is, they have fairly clear instructions on their site
2007-07-13T12:31:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	cotyrothery	did you see that warning in red letters on that site?
2007-07-13T12:32:00.000Z	cotyrothery	IndyGunFreak	i know the risk
2007-07-13T12:32:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	cotyrothery	thatsn ot my point, its telling you to contact your computer or motherboard manufacturer.
