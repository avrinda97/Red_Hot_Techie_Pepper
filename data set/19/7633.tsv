2007-07-22T14:20:00.000Z	bwoaas		No, I am running feisty
2007-07-22T14:20:00.000Z	bwoaas		Does nobode else get that update?
2007-07-22T14:21:00.000Z	stefg	bwoaas	which version are you on?
2007-07-22T14:21:00.000Z	stefg		!info iptables
2007-07-22T14:21:00.000Z	stefg	bwoaas	compare if you have the version above installed
2007-07-22T14:22:00.000Z	bwoaas		How can I quickly determine my iptables version?
2007-07-22T14:22:00.000Z	bwoaas		sources.list seems to contain the default, dutch mirrors
2007-07-22T14:23:00.000Z	stefg	bwoaas	iptables -V or dpkg -l | iptables
2007-07-22T14:24:00.000Z	bwoaas		I have 1.3.5
2007-07-22T14:24:00.000Z	stefg	bwoaas	ok, so if there are no dubious repos in your sources.list then update. get your gpg keys fixed
2007-07-22T14:25:00.000Z	bwoaas		So, I have a lower version of iptables, does that mean that it is okay to install the update that is not authenticated
2007-07-22T14:25:00.000Z	bwoaas		Ok, thanks!
2007-07-22T14:26:00.000Z	bwoaas		Oh, wait, synaptic says it is 1.3.6.0debian1-5ub
2007-07-22T14:26:00.000Z	bwoaas		I misread the last output :S.
2007-07-22T14:29:00.000Z	bwoaas	stefg	Sorry, I made a mistake. I have the correct version of iptables. Is there a delay in www.ubuntu.com/usn? Or is it possible that I have found a malicious update?
2007-07-22T14:31:00.000Z	stefg	bwoaas	delays certainly happen. but given the nature of iptables, a certain amount of paranoia seems healthy. I'd investigate wether your signing keys are out of date, or if you have indeed  a mlicious update. The day will com when the bad guys start attacking ubuntu
2007-07-22T14:32:00.000Z	bwoaas		Ok, do you have a pointer to a website that explains this signing process? Or google search terms?
