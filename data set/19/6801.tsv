2009-01-25T08:45:00.000Z	haji		:(
2009-01-25T08:45:00.000Z	jrib	haji	do you have a question?
2009-01-25T08:46:00.000Z	haji	jrib	yep, I want to install python 2.6.1, but there's an error after I type 'make'. I'm looking for a guide or something

2009-01-25T08:49:00.000Z	jrib	haji	before we sort that out.  How are you installing python exactly?  What did you run since extracting the tarball?
2009-01-25T08:50:00.000Z	haji	jrib	mmm just ./configure and then make
2009-01-25T08:50:00.000Z	jrib	haji	you shouldn't be using make.  That's going to mess things up
2009-01-25T08:51:00.000Z	haji	jrib	so what do I do?
2009-01-25T08:52:00.000Z	jrib	haji	make altinstall instead of make (see the installation docs)
2009-01-25T08:53:00.000Z	haji	jrib	ok, i'll try that, thanks
2009-01-25T08:53:00.000Z	jrib	haji	that won't fix your error.
2009-01-25T08:54:00.000Z	haji	jrib	oh, how can I fix the error?
2009-01-25T08:57:00.000Z	jrib	haji	install the build dependencies for the python package in the repositories
2009-01-25T08:58:00.000Z	haji	jrib	ahh i see, I will search for those packages
2009-01-25T08:58:00.000Z	jrib	haji	you can do something like 'sudo apt-get build-dep python-dev' or whatever
2009-01-25T08:59:00.000Z	haji	jrib	thanks
