2006-11-05T06:13:00.000Z	sethk	robster	no need to guess.  try it and tell us.  As I've already told you, the likely reason is that the DISPLAY environment variable is not set.
2006-11-05T06:14:00.000Z	robster	sethk	OK ... I understand that the DISPLAY environment is not set.  How do I set it?
2006-11-05T06:14:00.000Z	sethk	robster	export DISPLAY=:0.0
2006-11-05T06:15:00.000Z	sethk	robster	in another window, as the normal user (not as root), do this:     xhost +
2006-11-05T06:15:00.000Z	sethk	robster	then back in this window, try running again.
2006-11-05T06:16:00.000Z	sethk	robster	try zcat[1]  's suggestion first
2006-11-05T06:21:00.000Z	sethk	robster	right, because your normal user has the rights to display on your X server
