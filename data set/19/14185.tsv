2004-10-26T06:35:00.000Z	pixelmonkey		has anyone here compiled XOrg for Ubuntu?
2004-10-26T06:37:00.000Z	pixelmonkey		I noticed that Ubuntu doesn't install gcc, bison and flex by default... is there anything else I need to install to compile Xorg?
2004-10-26T06:37:00.000Z	pixelmonkey		also, more general question, does Ubuntu have galeon packages at all?  I can't seem to find them in universe or in warty
2004-10-26T06:38:00.000Z	Phr0stByte	pixelmonkey	You an artist?
2004-10-26T06:39:00.000Z	pixelmonkey	Phr0stByte	no, why?
2004-10-26T06:39:00.000Z	Phr0stByte	pixelmonkey	screen name
2004-10-26T06:40:00.000Z	pixelmonkey	Phr0stByte	ah, no.  My nick reflects how most of what we do nowadays is push pixels around the screen like monkeys :)
2004-10-26T06:40:00.000Z	Phr0stByte	pixelmonkey	trying to find someone to help with a Wacom drawing tablet that is stubbern as hell
2004-10-26T06:41:00.000Z	pixelmonkey	Phr0stByte	I have a wacom tablet, but haven't yet ever attempted to get it working under Linux...
2004-10-26T06:41:00.000Z	pixelmonkey		I only use it rarely anyway
2004-10-26T06:41:00.000Z	Phr0stByte	pixelmonkey	is it USB?
2004-10-26T06:41:00.000Z	pixelmonkey	Phr0stByte	yep, I think it's the most generic Wacom USB tablet
2004-10-26T06:41:00.000Z	Phr0stByte	pixelmonkey	Well, good luck
2004-10-26T06:41:00.000Z	pixelmonkey	Phr0stByte	I remember researching and I saw that someone had written a driver for it for Linux.
2004-10-26T06:42:00.000Z	Phr0stByte	pixelmonkey	yes - the driver from hell
2004-10-26T06:42:00.000Z	pixelmonkey	Phr0stByte	heh, well.  I think most artists don't use Linux, so the market isn't screaming
2004-10-26T06:43:00.000Z	Phr0stByte	pixelmonkey	There are success stories, but I have not found any on a 2.6 kernel
2004-10-26T06:45:00.000Z	Phr0stByte	pixelmonkey	Do me a favor and see if you cant get yours goin.
2004-10-26T06:47:00.000Z	pixelmonkey	Phr0stByte	I would if I could, but the tablet's not with me right now
