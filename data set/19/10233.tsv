2008-12-30T20:33:00.000Z	neeto		where do I find the file for my active sound card?
2008-12-30T20:33:00.000Z	norbert79	neeto	? What file? What are you looking for?
2008-12-30T20:33:00.000Z	neeto	norbert79	the device file
2008-12-30T20:34:00.000Z	norbert79	neeto	You are looking for the module? First, find out what model was loaded
2008-12-30T20:34:00.000Z	norbert79	neeto	Linux works way different, than Windows, there are no device files actually, or not in the same way
2008-12-30T20:36:00.000Z	neeto	norbert79	I am not looking for the module. I already know that. I want to know the path of my soundcard... where it's located in the filesystem.
2008-12-30T20:36:00.000Z	norbert79	neeto	I guess that would be /lib/modules as the kernel is stored there partly
2008-12-30T20:40:00.000Z	neeto	norbert79	I'm talking about the file that acts as a frontend to the soundcard... like, if a program asks you for the path to your sound device, how do I find out the path?
2008-12-30T20:40:00.000Z	norbert79	neeto	ah, you are referring to the /dev directory, which is a virtual diorectory
2008-12-30T20:41:00.000Z	neeto	norbert79	yeah, but /dev/snd is a mess... how do I find out what's what?
2008-12-30T20:41:00.000Z	norbert79	neeto	I am still confused what you are looking for... /dev/snd is ALWAYS the main soundcard
2008-12-30T20:42:00.000Z	neeto	norbert79	what about /dev/dsp?
2008-12-30T20:42:00.000Z	norbert79	neeto	Ehm, I meant /dev/dsp, sorry, have several windows open
2008-12-30T20:45:00.000Z	norbert79		medibuntu | rockyrock
2008-12-30T20:45:00.000Z	norbert79		!medibuntu | rockyrock
2008-12-30T20:45:00.000Z	neeto	norbert79	I don't think it's /dev/dsp either... I am using alsa... if that can direct the search to another file in /dev/
2008-12-30T20:45:00.000Z	norbert79	neeto	I would advise you to try to understand the concept of sound under Linux first...
2008-12-30T20:46:00.000Z	norbert79	neeto	Alsa is a method, like OSS, and pulseaudio is a daemon
2008-12-30T20:46:00.000Z	norbert79	neeto	If you cannot tell the differences, make yourself know with the basics
