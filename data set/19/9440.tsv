2008-04-22T08:04:00.000Z	black_13		or debian?
2008-04-22T08:05:00.000Z	black_13		well to be honest im using debian
2008-04-22T08:06:00.000Z	black_13		but i was wondering if other distros had made changes to the support apps for the kernel
2008-04-22T08:06:00.000Z	black_13		such as the initial ram disk or grub or splash
2008-04-22T08:07:00.000Z	black_13		makes sense
2008-04-22T08:08:00.000Z	black_13		well i have been googling for anything that would quiet the bootup process
2008-04-22T08:08:00.000Z	black_13		this is for an embedded device idont want customere or better yet competitors to have idea what is going on under the hood
2008-04-22T08:08:00.000Z	Jordan_U	black_13	What do you mean by "quiet" it?
2008-04-22T08:09:00.000Z	black_13		the system boots you see xorg
2008-04-22T08:09:00.000Z	black_13		thats it
2008-04-22T08:09:00.000Z	Jordan_U	black_13	If applicable usplash should do that just fine
2008-04-22T08:09:00.000Z	black_13		i was working usplash
2008-04-22T08:09:00.000Z	black_13		and it got close
2008-04-22T08:10:00.000Z	Jordan_U	black_13	Is this some sort of kiosk?
2008-04-22T08:11:00.000Z	Jordan_U	black_13	There may also be a simple way to switch to tty7 early on ( I don't think that any messages are displayed there and that's where the first X session starts by default
2008-04-22T08:12:00.000Z	black_13	Jordan_U	so shunt off the messages to some other place?
2008-04-22T08:12:00.000Z	black_13		yeah that would be fine by me
2008-04-22T08:12:00.000Z	black_13	Jordan_U	so how would i go about doing that?
2008-04-22T08:13:00.000Z	Jordan_U	black_13	First thing I would try ( since it's the easiest, though it probably won't work ) would be to remove all tty's but tty7 ( there are many guides on how to do this )
