2006-10-16T08:21:00.000Z	tuqann		yes, I know, but I never seem to get anything working
2006-10-16T08:21:00.000Z	tuqann		so so I HAVE to be online in order to fix the drivers?
2006-10-16T08:21:00.000Z	tuqann		I did check this page, I actually have a printout next to me
2006-10-16T08:22:00.000Z	tuqann		as well as three other more
2006-10-16T08:22:00.000Z	tuqann		but they still confuse the hell out of me
2006-10-16T08:22:00.000Z	tuqann		for starters, none of the atp-get commands are working
2006-10-16T08:23:00.000Z	tuqann		I'm not sure I am connected when I'm in Ubuntu text prompt
2006-10-16T08:23:00.000Z	tuqann		okay
2006-10-16T08:23:00.000Z	tuqann		is the program runable on winxp? (I'm duel booting)
2006-10-16T08:23:00.000Z	tuqann		automatix
2006-10-16T08:24:00.000Z	mnepton	tuqann	start Ubuntu, and start Synaptic. do a name search for fglrx. see what you have.
2006-10-16T08:24:00.000Z	mnepton	tuqann	if you can do all that in the next 5 years or so, the channel should still be here ;)
2006-10-16T08:26:00.000Z	mnepton	tuqann	no to fix anything until you're in Ubuntu. and no way to tell what the exact solution is until you do a little investigation.
2006-10-16T08:26:00.000Z	mnepton	tuqann	can you get on the 'net from Ubuntu?
2006-10-16T08:27:00.000Z	mnepton	tuqann	launch GAIM and use it to connect here
2006-10-16T08:27:00.000Z	mnepton	tuqann	or try Firefox, or ping, or ...
2006-10-16T08:28:00.000Z	mnepton	tuqann	in a terminal, "ifconfig"
2006-10-16T08:28:00.000Z	mnepton	tuqann	no, ifconfig
2006-10-16T08:29:00.000Z	mnepton	tuqann	if the primary ethernet interface has an IP address, you probably have DNS issues.
