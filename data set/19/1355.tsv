2011-02-19T11:43:00.000Z	KXTwo	Arney	boot into ubuntu from your usb, then use gpart to set up your partitions, then reboot and i nstead of booting into ubunto arrow to the install option
2011-02-19T11:44:00.000Z	Arney	KXTwo	Ubuntu wont boot, it get stuck in "user id unknown"
2011-02-19T11:46:00.000Z	KXTwo	Arney	 did you download 32 bit or 64 bit?
2011-02-19T11:47:00.000Z	KXTwo	Arney	from here: http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop/get-ubuntu/download ?

2011-02-19T11:48:00.000Z	Arney	KXTwo	on the third line of the error I get, xor: automatically using best checksuming function: PIII_SSE
2011-02-19T11:49:00.000Z	Arney	KXTwo	once using unetbootin and another time with Quniversal usb installer"
2011-02-19T11:53:00.000Z	KXTwo	Arney	you dont need to change any options on universal usb installer unless you want persistence, delete both iso's youve downloaded, download a new one
2011-02-19T11:54:00.000Z	Arney	KXTwo	It wont fit without me formatting the stick.. but ok
2011-02-19T11:54:00.000Z	KXTwo	Arney	it wont fit without your formatting?
2011-02-19T11:55:00.000Z	KXTwo	Arney	I said to clear it, if you are going to format do fat32
2011-02-19T11:56:00.000Z	Arney	KXTwo	I always formatted to fat32
2011-02-19T11:56:00.000Z	Arney	KXTwo	its downloading, again. itll take 28 minutes
