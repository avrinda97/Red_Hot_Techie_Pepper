2008-04-26T07:18:00.000Z	jstritar		my problems started when it tried installing "lopenofice-org-writer2latex" then a lot of things failed after that
2008-04-26T07:18:00.000Z	ffm_	jstritar	The problem is when you use a lot of packages unsupported by ubuntu.
2008-04-26T07:18:00.000Z	jstritar	ffm_	do you know where i can at least see a log of the install? /var/log/apt doesn't have it
2008-04-26T07:19:00.000Z	ffm_	jstritar	Sadly, I don't know.
2008-04-26T07:19:00.000Z	jstritar	ffm_	even so, it shoudl recognize packages that aren't supported and at least warn you
2008-04-26T07:19:00.000Z	ffm_	jstritar	It did, when you first installed them.
2008-04-26T07:19:00.000Z	jstritar	ffm_	yeah, well when they don't support the latest graphics cards you have to do that
2008-04-26T07:20:00.000Z	jstritar	ffm_	they shouldn't pretend like you can upgrade
2008-04-26T07:20:00.000Z	ffm_	jstritar	They don't _pretend_.
2008-04-26T07:20:00.000Z	ffm_	jstritar	When you install "community supported software" it isn't supported by canonical.
2008-04-26T07:20:00.000Z	jstritar	ffm_	that doesn't mean ubuntu should upgrade without warning you it might break your entire system
2008-04-26T07:21:00.000Z	ffm_	jstritar	Uh, that's implicit in any upgrade. You should always back up data, but especially with system updates.
2008-04-26T07:21:00.000Z	jstritar	ffm_	do you know of way of trying to resolve upgrade issues?
2008-04-26T07:22:00.000Z	ffm_	jstritar	What's the spesific issue?
2008-04-26T07:22:00.000Z	ffm_	jstritar	Best way is a fresh install, but what's the broken package?
2008-04-26T07:22:00.000Z	jstritar	ffm_	i don't know b/c i closed the window and there's no log. but after restarting i have no network & the video is messed up
2008-04-26T07:22:00.000Z	jstritar	ffm_	a lot of packages failed near the end
2008-04-26T07:23:00.000Z	ffm_	jstritar	Uh, why'd you close the window? The generic fix is "sudo dpkg-reconfigure -a" to reconfigure all packages. Try that first.
2008-04-26T07:23:00.000Z	jstritar	ffm_	i dunno it was stupid of me
