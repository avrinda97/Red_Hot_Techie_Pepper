2007-03-31T08:40:00.000Z	Elle294	LjL	what do you advice to say to amule as band's limitation to use well mozilla?
2007-03-31T08:41:00.000Z	LjL	Elle294	it depends on your connection. how fast do you download things?
2007-03-31T08:41:00.000Z	Elle294	LjL	, hem.. i really dont know.. :(
2007-03-31T08:42:00.000Z	LjL	Elle294	then go by trial and error ;) start with something like 500Kb/s, and then turn it down 100Kb/s at a time until you can surf the web well enough
2007-03-31T08:43:00.000Z	Elle294	LjL	perfect!!! ^^ tencs a lot
2007-03-31T08:44:00.000Z	Elle294	LjL	ah, uops, last question.. i have to limitate both downloads and uploads?
2007-03-31T08:44:00.000Z	LjL	Elle294	uhm yes. but then again, you should know how fast your connection is... or, set upload to 100Kb/s, and decrement in 10Kb/s steps
2007-03-31T08:45:00.000Z	Elle294	LjL	ok.. and how can i learn how fast my connection is?
2007-03-31T08:45:00.000Z	LjL	Elle294	check the contract with your provider =)
2007-03-31T08:46:00.000Z	Elle294	LjL	hehe.. easy to say but i think i dont know how do it..
2007-03-31T08:46:00.000Z	LjL	Elle294	well, you could try downloading a large file from a fast server (like the Ubuntu CD from the italian mirror), but that won't give you your upload speed
2007-03-31T08:47:00.000Z	Elle294	LjL	ok now i think i will try that site!
2007-03-31T08:51:00.000Z	LjL	Elle294	then set download to 190kb/s or so. upload, make it... not sure, 15kb/s or so
2007-03-31T08:52:00.000Z	Elle294	LjL	and so i could use mozzilla without problems that it's slow, right?
2007-03-31T08:52:00.000Z	LjL	Elle294	depends. 15kb/s upload might still be a bit too high, try and see
2007-03-31T08:53:00.000Z	Elle294	LjL	perfect. thaks a lot. i go. byeee
