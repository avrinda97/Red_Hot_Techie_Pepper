2005-01-10T07:43:00.000Z	Kamion	JayeAeotiv	thanks for sharing ;)
2005-01-10T09:33:00.000Z	Kamion	JayeAeotiv	typically you follow the instructions given by the server admin
2005-01-10T09:34:00.000Z	JayeAeotiv	Kamion	I've got a bit of info but not much.
2005-01-10T09:34:00.000Z	Kamion	JayeAeotiv	connecting by pserver or ssh?
2005-01-10T09:35:00.000Z	Kamion	JayeAeotiv	typically something like 'cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.example.org:/cvs/example login', 'cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.example.org:/cvs/example co <module>'
2005-01-10T09:35:00.000Z	JayeAeotiv	Kamion	ssh
2005-01-10T09:39:00.000Z	JayeAeotiv	Kamion	it says I can only use the login command with pserver
2005-01-10T09:40:00.000Z	Kamion	JayeAeotiv	yeah, ditch login for :ext:
2005-01-10T09:41:00.000Z	Kamion	JayeAeotiv	you may also need to 'export CVS_RSH=ssh'; I can't remember if that's the default
