Cause, i never ran linux, but i keep hearing over the years that performance-wise, it beats winblows anytime, but i dont want to RTFM for days just to install a game or video card
2007-03-26T09:15:00.000Z	fuNk		Ah
2007-03-26T09:16:00.000Z	fuNk		isnt Ubuntu just another version of linux, like mandrake or redhat
2007-03-26T09:16:00.000Z	fuNk		?
2007-03-26T09:16:00.000Z	fuNk		<- linux noob
2007-03-26T09:16:00.000Z	fuNk		and apparently Ubuntu is the most user friendly linux OS as of yet
2007-03-26T09:17:00.000Z	fuNk		see, something as simple as checking his vid memory card
2007-03-26T09:17:00.000Z	fuNk		seems a pain
2007-03-26T09:17:00.000Z	Toma-	fuNk	its the most popular so youll get plenty of help and packages for it
2007-03-26T09:20:00.000Z	Toma-	fuNk	well click SYstem > Help > User Guide and red it for yourself. we're here to help with bigger issues.
2007-03-26T09:20:00.000Z	fuNk	Toma-	im not running linux
2007-03-26T09:20:00.000Z	Toma-	fuNk	right. well next time you instyall ubuntu, read the user guide provided with it and youll know all there is to know :)
2007-03-26T09:21:00.000Z	fuNk	Toma-	then why is is that its such a pain to install a simple video card or like the gentlemen above me earlier, who googled for hours just to know how to check his vid ram
2007-03-26T09:21:00.000Z	Toma-	fuNk	because you and him didnt read the guide.
2007-03-26T09:21:00.000Z	fuNk	Toma-	lol
2007-03-26T09:22:00.000Z	Toma-	fuNk	heck, you can even search the guide for "video drivers" and install it within 30 seconds of reading it
2007-03-26T09:24:00.000Z	Toma-	fuNk	its all about licensing. windows is a multi-billion dollar OS and ubuntu is totally free. no-ones going to shell out huge amounts to let ubuntu have proprietry licenses for mp3 and video drivers and codecs.
2007-03-26T09:25:00.000Z	Toma-	fuNk	btw, this is a support channel... lets continue in #ubuntu-offtopic :)
2007-03-26T09:25:00.000Z	fuNk	Toma-	: ok
