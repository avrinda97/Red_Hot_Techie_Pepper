2010-05-06T08:51:00.000Z	red2kic	donaldo	Try the link.
2010-05-06T08:52:00.000Z	red2kic	donaldo	You're using alsa?
2010-05-06T08:53:00.000Z	donaldo	red2kic	for some reason, does not work the last version of alsa
2010-05-06T08:54:00.000Z	donaldo	red2kic	cat /proc/asound/card0/codec#0 |grep Codec
2010-05-06T08:54:00.000Z	red2kic	donaldo	You might have to enable it. Try alsamixergui (it's GUI!)
2010-05-06T08:56:00.000Z	donaldo	red2kic	Hello. I have a Toshiba x205-S9349, with a Intel 82801H (ICH8 Family) HD Audio Controller. After I installed lynx I only get sound from 2 speakers. I'm trying to get to work my 4.1 built in speakers, I have tried several ways with no luck.
2010-05-06T08:58:00.000Z	red2kic	donaldo	Did you tried alsamixer though? You said several ways but that's not quite what I wanted to know.
2010-05-06T08:59:00.000Z	donaldo	red2kic	yes no LFE control
2010-05-06T09:00:00.000Z	red2kic	donaldo	#alsa or #pulseaudio -- Try them. Also, what card? I'll try and find you something useful.
