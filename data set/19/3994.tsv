2009-04-21T13:52:00.000Z	sluimers		I can't connect to my tomcat. When I  try to connect through firefox it just keeps loading forever.
2009-04-21T13:52:00.000Z	BladeAway	sluimers	bounce the tomcat
2009-04-21T13:53:00.000Z	sluimers	BladeAway	bounce?
2009-04-21T13:53:00.000Z	BladeAway	sluimers	recycle the instance
2009-04-21T13:53:00.000Z	BladeAway	sluimers	restart
2009-04-21T13:53:00.000Z	BladeAway	sluimers	have u checked tomcat logs for ooms and hung threads?
2009-04-21T13:57:00.000Z	BladeAway	sluimers	check under /usr/ for a tomcat directory
2009-04-21T13:58:00.000Z	sluimers	BladeAway	there's a bin, lib and webapps folder there, nothing else
2009-04-21T13:59:00.000Z	BladeAway	sluimers	under there?
2009-04-21T13:59:00.000Z	sluimers	BladeAway	yes
2009-04-21T13:59:00.000Z	BladeAway	sluimers	webapps default root is only saying that there is one default apps running in tomcat deployment
2009-04-21T14:00:00.000Z	BladeAway	sluimers	thats normal check under there to see if there is a log directory or even start ur find command from that directory under user.. logs are somewhere for tomcat.. all in all unless u plan on patching the application,, i suggest stopping and startig tomcat
2009-04-21T14:01:00.000Z	BladeAway	sluimers	its just common to investigate why the instance is hung,, usually oom or out of memory errors ,, hung threads,, or code errors cause these issues,, if u leave tomcat up for some time,, and when u run top if java is always in the top 5 with high cpu usage and rss size u may need to restart the tomcat to make it responsive
2009-04-21T14:03:00.000Z	sluimers	BladeAway	okay, there's no logs there though
2009-04-21T14:03:00.000Z	sluimers	BladeAway	just an index.html file and a context.xml
2009-04-21T14:05:00.000Z	BladeAway	sluimers	how did u install tomcat is a better question? tomcat can basically just be placed anywhere and told where java is..
2009-04-21T14:05:00.000Z	sluimers	BladeAway	ah! I found the og!
2009-04-21T14:06:00.000Z	BladeAway	sluimers	awesome,, now i guess just check for those type of errors i usually like to do this,,,
2009-04-21T14:15:00.000Z	sluimers	BladeAway	thanks! It turned out I forot a quote when I edited in tomcat-users.xml
