2007-11-24T05:19:00.000Z	Slart	noelferreira	try disabling the splash screen.. works for me
2007-11-24T05:20:00.000Z	noelferreira	Slart	where in gconf-editor?
2007-11-24T05:21:00.000Z	Slart	noelferreira	not in gconf.. open /boot/grub/menu.lst and remove the "splash" for your boot command.. you can also do this directly when booting.. just edit the line and remove splash.. or perhaps you add "nosplash"..
2007-11-24T05:22:00.000Z	Slart	noelferreira	disregard the splash.. just add a nosplash
2008-06-04T00:10:00.000Z	Slart	noelferreira	I think you set the resolution on the server side..
2008-06-04T00:11:00.000Z	Slart	noelferreira	I don't know what server vino uses.. but it's usually a parameter called --geometry when running a command line server
2008-06-04T00:11:00.000Z	noelferreira	Slart	where can i get more information on that?
2008-06-04T00:12:00.000Z	Slart	noelferreira	I think, since vino uses your current desktop, it would the same as your screen res.. but I'm only guessing here.. never used it
2008-06-04T00:15:00.000Z	Slart	noelferreira	have you checked the vino docs?
2008-06-04T01:31:00.000Z	Slart	noelferreira	I don't think you can change it.. it uses the current desktop resolution, afaik
2008-06-04T01:32:00.000Z	noelferreira	Slart	what happened to vnc project?
2008-06-04T01:32:00.000Z	Slart	noelferreira	vnc is available too.. it's an alternative.
2008-06-04T01:32:00.000Z	Slart	noelferreira	if you use a vnc server you can set the resolution
2008-06-04T01:33:00.000Z	noelferreira	Slart	that's because with the resolution i have in the server the connection is to slow
2008-06-04T01:33:00.000Z	noelferreira	Slart	yes i always used vnc and it worked always very good
2008-06-04T01:33:00.000Z	Slart	noelferreira	hmm.. but install a vnc-server then.. it's not that hard
2008-06-04T01:33:00.000Z	noelferreira	Slart	i used it for almost 10 years lol
2008-06-04T01:34:00.000Z	Slart	noelferreira	then you'll be done before I have time to make coffee =)
