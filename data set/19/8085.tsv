2007-05-13T15:47:00.000Z	siloko		hi I just installed Conky, which is cool, but it doesn't detect my CPU temp, any ideas how I can sort this?
2007-05-13T15:48:00.000Z	siloko		any other conky users out there?
2007-05-13T15:49:00.000Z	jpjacobs	siloko	i guess you have to adjust ~/.conkyrc
2007-05-13T15:50:00.000Z	siloko	jpjacobs	well the rc file is just reading acpitemp, which I supppose must just be zero . . .
2007-05-13T15:51:00.000Z	siloko	jpjacobs	any ideas what I caould change it too . . . I'm on a toshiba laptop
2007-05-13T15:52:00.000Z	jpjacobs	siloko	does acpi -t return something sensible?
2007-05-13T15:52:00.000Z	siloko	jpjacobs	no support for device type: thermal, but gives me tha battery charge
2007-05-13T15:53:00.000Z	siloko	jpjacobs	i suppose that's my problem . . .
2007-05-13T15:53:00.000Z	jpjacobs	siloko	is that an old laptop? that maybe does not yet support thermal?
2007-05-13T15:53:00.000Z	siloko	jpjacobs	 only a year old . . . i'm sure i can get temp in windows, but i can't remeber so long since i booted that partition ;)
2007-05-13T15:54:00.000Z	jpjacobs	siloko	maybe some needed module does not get modprobed by default..
2007-05-13T15:55:00.000Z	siloko	jpjacobs	I added the two modules lmsensors suggests after running sensor-detect . . . but no luck with them either . . .
2007-05-13T15:55:00.000Z	jpjacobs	siloko	try sudo modprobe thermal (it's a module i see is loaded here)
2007-05-13T15:57:00.000Z	siloko	jpjacobs	just exits without comment
2007-05-13T15:57:00.000Z	jpjacobs	siloko	and now try the acpistuff (it's normal it doesn't return anything)
2007-05-13T15:58:00.000Z	siloko	jpjacobs	same deal
2007-05-13T15:58:00.000Z	siloko	jpjacobs	i think thermal was already loaded, i seem to remeber it in a probe listing from earlier
2007-05-13T15:58:00.000Z	jpjacobs	siloko	then i don't really know what's going on, sorry
2007-05-13T15:58:00.000Z	siloko	jpjacobs	 ok no worries, thx for trying :)
