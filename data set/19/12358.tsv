2007-05-06T06:23:00.000Z	RubyforRails		Hey is there a quick way to get into the console while your inside of a dir in the gui?
2007-05-06T06:24:00.000Z	Flannel	RubyforRails	theres a nautilus extension you can install, "nautilus-open-terminal" is the package, that'll put it in your right click menu
2007-05-06T06:41:00.000Z	Flannel	RubyforRails	httpd.conf isn't used in Ubuntu.  And, it's /etc/apache2/ since youre most likely usign that.  Ubuntu uses a few places for config.  apache2.conf for system wide things, then sites-available for site specific things, then mods-available for module specific config.  The stuff you're interested in will be in sites-available
2007-05-06T06:42:00.000Z	Flannel	RubyforRails	I never said that.  I said the config stuff isn't in httpd.conf, but elsewhere.
2007-05-06T06:43:00.000Z	Flannel	RubyforRails	That depends on what you're changing, like I said.  Either apache2.conf, /sites-available/* or /mods-available/*
2007-05-06T06:43:00.000Z	Flannel	RubyforRails	.htpasswd is actually in your we folder.  /var/www
2007-05-06T06:44:00.000Z	Flannel	RubyforRails	er, sorry.  Im thinking of something else
2007-05-06T06:45:00.000Z	Flannel	RubyforRails	htpasswd will be put into your web dir though.  /var/www for example.
2007-05-06T07:19:00.000Z	Flannel	RubyforRails	someone's told you how to install Java.  What are you talking about?
2007-05-06T07:20:00.000Z	Flannel	RubyforRails	1.6 is in the repositories.
2007-05-06T07:23:00.000Z	Flannel	RubyforRails	the java page had a link, but there's another one.
2007-05-06T07:24:00.000Z	Flannel	RubyforRails	it's not.  The instructions are straight forward if you'd follow them step by step.
2007-05-06T07:26:00.000Z	Flannel	RubyforRails	the Java ones. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java
2007-05-06T07:27:00.000Z	Flannel	RubyforRails	the instructions for adding Multiverse are in a link at the top of that page, right after it says "To install java, you'll need Multiverse"
2007-05-06T08:55:00.000Z	Flannel	RubyforRails	Have you still not read that page?
2007-05-06T08:57:00.000Z	Flannel	RubyforRails	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java#head-7f353d2f3fb1a09aac09cf1caee565e897319306

2007-05-06T09:07:00.000Z	Flannel	RubyforRails	sudo apt-get install sun-java6-plugin
