2011-04-11T15:55:00.000Z	basobdutta	s3r3n1t7	using sudo visudo , i am getting the same parse error
2011-04-11T15:56:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	basobdutta	how did you exactly edit it then?
2011-04-11T15:58:00.000Z	basobdutta	s3r3n1t7	I wrote postgres ALL: NOPASSWRD
2011-04-11T16:00:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	basobdutta	please read carefully what i write. I need to see the content of the file /etc/sudoers. That line is not correct and has to be deleted. How did you add this line? Which command did you use?
2011-04-11T16:02:00.000Z	basobdutta	s3r3n1t7	Can you tell me how to remove this extra line from sudoers file . I simply used sudo /etc/sudoers to edit it and add that extra line.
2011-04-11T16:03:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	basobdutta	sudo /etc/sudoers is not a command to edit the file. Please tell me the command you used to edit the file.
2011-04-11T16:03:00.000Z	basobdutta	s3r3n1t7	sudo nano /etc/sudoers was jthe command.
2011-04-11T16:04:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	basobdutta	execute that command and remove the last line, then save it.
2011-04-11T16:05:00.000Z	basobdutta	s3r3n1t7	Thats what i am not able to do. I am getting parse error every time i try to run the command
2011-04-11T16:07:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	basobdutta	sudo cat /etc/sudoers > ~/sudoers              this should create a copy in your home directory. Can you pastebin the file sudoers from your home directory?
2011-04-11T16:10:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	basobdutta	make a pastebin from the terminal, including the command and the error.
2011-04-11T16:13:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	basobdutta	you will have to boot into recovery mode, then edit the sudoers file by removing the last line (the one with postgresql). You cannot do this from your running system as sudo cannot be used. Do not use nano or any other default text editor to edit the sudoers file, use visudo for this.
