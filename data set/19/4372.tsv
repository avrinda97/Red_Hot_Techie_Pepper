2009-01-28T12:01:00.000Z	cast|lir	adminn	can you run head /media/UT2004_DVD/linux-installer.sh?
2009-01-28T12:02:00.000Z	cast|lir	adminn	sure
2009-01-28T12:02:00.000Z	cast|lir	adminn	provided bios boots from liveusb without exploding
2009-01-28T12:03:00.000Z	cast|lir	adminn	so, is the file actually there?
2009-01-28T12:03:00.000Z	cast|lir	adminn	where did this '/media/UT2004_DVD/linux-installer.sh' string come from?
2009-01-28T12:05:00.000Z	cast|lir	adminn	you can't find the mount command?
2009-01-28T12:09:00.000Z	cast|lir	adminn	ls /media/cdrom0/ and see if that shows anything useful
2009-01-28T12:10:00.000Z	cast|lir	adminn	well there you go, try running that .sh
2009-01-28T12:13:00.000Z	cast|lir	adminn	see if sudo sh /media/cdrom0/linux-installer.sh does anything useful
2009-01-28T12:18:00.000Z	cast|lir	adminn	maybe pastebin what's going on
2009-01-28T12:22:00.000Z	cast|lir	adminn	hmm.
2009-01-28T12:25:00.000Z	cast|lir	adminn	hmm, some
2009-01-28T12:26:00.000Z	cast|lir	adminn	http://www.mepisguides.com/ut2k4/ut2k4.html says to copy the installer .sh to your homedir and ru nit from there, i'd try that. not sure how the installer works, but running the installer from the mounted dvd point might be an issue
2009-01-28T12:28:00.000Z	cast|lir	adminn	ahh, this is interesting 'You might also have to type "export SETUP_CDROM=/mnt/cdrom" before starting the installer, especially DVD users.' -- http://www.linuxelectrons.com/features/reviews/playing-unreal-tournament-2004-linux
