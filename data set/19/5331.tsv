2009-06-11T18:45:00.000Z	w0ls0n		running vmware-config.pl fails for me
2009-06-11T18:46:00.000Z	w0ls0n		Unable to build the vmmon module.
2009-06-11T18:46:00.000Z	w0ls0n		is there vmware server for ubuntu?
2009-06-11T18:46:00.000Z	w0ls0n		anyone else having this issue?
2009-06-11T18:48:00.000Z	w0ls0n		well
2009-06-11T18:48:00.000Z	w0ls0n		vmware is installed and working ... im just having a minor issue
2009-06-11T18:49:00.000Z	rob_p	w0ls0n	I've got a few minutes.  Just download the server package from vmware's site.  It comes with a nice installer script.
2009-06-11T18:50:00.000Z	rob_p	w0ls0n	Then what's the issue/
2009-06-11T18:50:00.000Z	rob_p	w0ls0n	Perhaps missing some of your development tools, libs, etc?
2009-06-11T18:52:00.000Z	rob_p	w0ls0n	...but if you already have it installed and working, why are you running the config utility again?  (and how did you get it to run the first time, for that matter?)
2009-06-11T18:52:00.000Z	w0ls0n	rob_p	read my pm. carelly.
2009-06-11T18:53:00.000Z	rob_p	w0ls0n	Ok.  Well I missed that the first time.
2009-06-11T18:54:00.000Z	rob_p	w0ls0n	So a kernel update started all this mess?
2009-06-11T18:56:00.000Z	rob_p	w0ls0n	I've had that happen and I had to remove the old kernel and all the development header files associated with it and then make sure you have the kernel headers for your current running kernel.  After that, you should be able to run the vmware config utility.
2009-06-11T18:57:00.000Z	w0ls0n	rob_p	well the issue is when I do updates via the pkg mgr is when I start having problems
2009-06-11T18:58:00.000Z	rob_p	w0ls0n	The package manager isn't going to satisfy the updates required for kernel modules you built for vmware against an older kernel.  That's why I'm asking if you recently pulled down an updated kernel.
2009-06-11T18:59:00.000Z	rob_p	w0ls0n	It's probably pretty easy to fix.  A reload is sorta drastic, don't you think?
2009-06-11T19:00:00.000Z	rob_p	w0ls0n	I'd purge your old kernel and old kernel-headers, verify you have the current kernel headers and then rerun the vmware config script.
2009-06-11T19:00:00.000Z	rob_p	w0ls0n	That will probably solve your issue... but whatever.  Ok, good luck.
