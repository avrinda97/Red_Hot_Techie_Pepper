2005-03-05T08:59:00.000Z	lavigj		hey guys, can someone give me a hand ripping an ISO of a CD? I have tried dd if=/media/cdrom1 of=my_cd.iso but it is saying that /media/cdrom1 is a directory
2005-03-05T09:01:00.000Z	lavigj		[Spooky] : nope
2005-03-05T09:02:00.000Z	lavigj		[Spooky] : just a data cd
2005-03-05T09:02:00.000Z	dud	lavigj	mkisofs -o file.iso /path/
2005-03-05T09:03:00.000Z	lavigj	dud	I thought about that too... I was trying to get the dd method to work. Thanks for all the help though! it's always nice to get more help than I know what to do with
2005-03-05T09:35:00.000Z	dud	lavigj	I know the guy who makes dosbox :P
2005-03-05T09:35:00.000Z	lavigj	dud	agreed. I need to get .63 for iso loading unfortunately

2005-03-05T09:43:00.000Z	lavigj	dud	yeah, I am gonna man apt-get a minute to see if it is worth the effort...
2005-03-05T09:55:00.000Z	dud	lavigj	if you're paranoid or very clumsy, you could fetch the file in question through ftp, and use dpkg -i
2005-03-05T09:56:00.000Z	lavigj	dud	nah, like I siad... not a huge deal if I frag this system, just want to know what I am getting into :)
2005-03-05T09:57:00.000Z	lavigj	dud	do you happen to have the link to that wiki entry handy?
2005-03-05T10:00:00.000Z	lavigj	dud	thank you much sir
2005-03-05T10:09:00.000Z	lavigj	dud	thanks
2005-03-05T10:11:00.000Z	lavigj	dud	I only have deb-src hoary universe
2005-03-05T10:11:00.000Z	dud	lavigj	doesnt dosbox have rpm's?
2005-03-05T10:11:00.000Z	lavigj	dud	probably, but what about dependecies?
2005-03-05T10:12:00.000Z	dud	lavigj	get the warty dependencies perhaps
2005-03-05T10:12:00.000Z	lavigj	dud	I already have those I think, since I had dosbox installed once
