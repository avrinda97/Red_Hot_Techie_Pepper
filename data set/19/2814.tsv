2010-04-28T00:45:00.000Z	anodesni		I would like to use ubuntu 10.04, but I have a 1366 x 768 screen and ubuntu just uses more space in the GUI compared to my mandriva setup. Can somebody explain the difference?
2010-04-28T00:46:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	anodesni	different theme?
2010-04-28T00:46:00.000Z	anodesni	brontosaurusrex	no, the window bars are the same height
2010-04-28T00:46:00.000Z	anodesni	brontosaurusrex	but, e.g., firefox menu (with file edit etc.) is just larger by 4-6 pixels
2010-04-28T00:47:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	anodesni	bigger fonts?
2010-04-28T00:48:00.000Z	anodesni	brontosaurusrex	It's strange but ubuntu has always felt big (and sluggish)
2010-04-28T00:51:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	anodesni	only app that really looks fat to me is xchat i suppose, but only since my res is quite low for 2010...
2010-04-28T00:51:00.000Z	anodesni	brontosaurusrex	xchat on Mandriva is lean

2010-04-28T00:54:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	anodesni	thats pretty much the default ubuntu? i'd get rid of one of those panels
2010-04-28T00:54:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	anodesni	keep one, and set that one to hide...
2010-04-28T00:55:00.000Z	anodesni	brontosaurusrex	I'll show the difference with virtualbox
2010-04-28T00:59:00.000Z	anodesni	brontosaurusrex	http://imagebin.ca/view/jmNJZbJP.html   see the difference?
2010-04-28T01:02:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	anodesni	yes, but thats not the same theme, isnt it?
2010-04-28T01:02:00.000Z	anodesni	brontosaurusrex	wait
2010-04-28T01:04:00.000Z	anodesni	brontosaurusrex	you're right, it is because of the theme http://imagebin.ca/view/K1SKet.html
2010-04-28T01:05:00.000Z	anodesni	brontosaurusrex	but why is ubuntu using such a 'fat' theme and not a 'lean' one like mandriva
2010-04-28T01:08:00.000Z	anodesni	brontosaurusrex	only if you like a purple terminal
