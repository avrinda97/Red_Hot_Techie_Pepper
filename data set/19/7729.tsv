2007-07-08T15:39:00.000Z	kyle__		so... I'm in my xorg.conf file.. now how do I change my screen resolution? I'm sorry but I really do need like step by step instructions here, I'm a total newb to linux and all this technical stuff
2007-07-08T15:40:00.000Z	ilikec0ws	kyle__	Right at the very bottom, you'll see a section about "Display" with aload of depths/modes in it, with resoultions in side ""
2007-07-08T15:42:00.000Z	kyle__	ilikec0ws	yeah I see it, what do I do with it?
2007-07-08T15:43:00.000Z	ilikec0ws	kyle__	Check what the number is after DefaultDepth, usually 24, go down to the modes line under  Depth 24 section add the resolution you want before the others listed in the same format
2007-07-08T15:44:00.000Z	kyle__	ilikec0ws	I just type in what I want in "s and then the option will be there?
2007-07-08T15:49:00.000Z	kyle__	ilikec0ws	I added 1280x1024 to the modes under the default depth and its still not an option in system/preferences/screen resolution
2007-07-08T15:49:00.000Z	ilikec0ws	kyle__	Pastebin me your xorg.conf
2007-07-08T15:49:00.000Z	kyle__	ilikec0ws	do what now? :P
