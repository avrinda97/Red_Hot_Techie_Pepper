2012-03-28T00:50:00.000Z	xananax		Hello
2012-03-28T00:50:00.000Z	xananax		I have that USB that does not work (hangs on safely remove)
2012-03-28T00:51:00.000Z	xananax		After trying a lot of things, I was able to make it work with sudo mount -o remount,async /dev/sda1
2012-03-28T00:51:00.000Z	xananax		so basically mounting it in sync mode
2012-03-28T00:51:00.000Z	xananax		Can I edit my fstab to add an entry for this usb and have it always mounted in sync?
2012-03-28T00:52:00.000Z	DJ	xananax	sudo nano /etc/fstab
2012-03-28T00:52:00.000Z	DJ	xananax	then create a bash script to Mount it,
2012-03-28T00:52:00.000Z	xananax	DJ	I would just enter the command every time, no prob, but it's an MP3 player that my mother has just bought
2012-03-28T00:53:00.000Z	DJ	xananax	just mount it with a bash script,
2012-03-28T00:54:00.000Z	DJ	xananax	install gtkpod,
2012-03-28T00:55:00.000Z	xananax	DJ	the problem is not syncing with a playlist, rythmox works fine
2012-03-28T00:58:00.000Z	xananax	DJ	ok let me explain the use case: I plug the drive, it shows, I can move songs to it through nautilus or rhythmbox or anyway I want. On removing the drive, it stalls on "writing data to disk" then fails
2012-03-28T00:58:00.000Z	DJ	xananax	remember eject the device, every time you'll eject the device,
2012-03-28T00:58:00.000Z	xananax	DJ	It's *not* ejecting, this is my problem
2012-03-28T00:59:00.000Z	DJ	xananax	eject /dev/sdb1 or whatever the device is,
2012-03-28T01:00:00.000Z	DJ	xananax	try umount
2012-03-28T01:01:00.000Z	xananax	DJ	It doesn't work
2012-03-28T01:01:00.000Z	xananax	DJ	sudo umount does not work
2012-03-28T01:01:00.000Z	DJ	xananax	are you putting the /device?
