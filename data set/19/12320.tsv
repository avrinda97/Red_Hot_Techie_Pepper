2005-09-23T06:27:00.000Z	inthenow		maybe its not so god to have a spambot gate...too hard for people to get in here
2005-09-23T06:28:00.000Z	inthenow		we need the people in here
2005-09-23T06:29:00.000Z	inthenow		cant freenode doing something about spambots?
2005-09-23T06:29:00.000Z	fek	inthenow	they are on their wy
2005-09-23T06:29:00.000Z	inthenow		a spambot "mote" isnt helpful
2005-09-23T06:29:00.000Z	fek	inthenow	you could prefent against it by using nickserv
2005-09-23T06:30:00.000Z	inthenow	fek	no everyone uses nickserv or likes it or understands it right away
2005-09-23T06:31:00.000Z	fek	inthenow	then tell me how you would fix the problem!
2005-09-23T06:31:00.000Z	fek	inthenow	i have no problem anymore until i am using nickserv like the opers configured it
2005-09-23T06:32:00.000Z	inthenow		no idea how to kill spambot threats
2005-09-23T06:32:00.000Z	fek	inthenow	and i think they do their job really god
2005-09-23T06:32:00.000Z	fek	inthenow	using nickserv is the only way
2005-09-23T06:32:00.000Z	inthenow		arent msgs repeated?
2005-09-23T06:32:00.000Z	fek		of course
2005-09-23T06:32:00.000Z	fek		but when you want to filter thinks like that, you have to filter content
2005-09-23T06:33:00.000Z	fek		and that's not a thing that an oper should do!
2005-09-23T06:33:00.000Z	fek	inthenow	an correct oper will never touch the content of the users
2005-09-23T06:33:00.000Z	inthenow		dont spambots repeat the same thing? maybe the server or multiple bots can detect repeats and notify the freenode
2005-09-23T06:34:00.000Z	fek	inthenow	you have to scan the content wich users will tell over the ircnet and that is not a nice way
