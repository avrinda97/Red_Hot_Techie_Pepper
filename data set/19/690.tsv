2011-10-14T06:04:00.000Z	Vj		?
2011-10-14T06:06:00.000Z	Vj		can anyone help me with triple booting?
2011-10-14T06:07:00.000Z	Vj		macbook pro with lion and win 7 already installed
2011-10-14T06:07:00.000Z	Vj		via bootcamp
2011-10-14T06:08:00.000Z	Vj		just would like to know the correct procedure I've heard that there are issues with refit and lion
2011-10-14T06:08:00.000Z	Vj		it would be much slower wouldn't it?
2011-10-14T06:09:00.000Z	deebee_	Vj	I'm running it in a VM right now on MacOS on a MacBook Pro
2011-10-14T06:10:00.000Z	deebee_	Vj	Should be fine if you're doing run of the mill stuff
2011-10-14T06:11:00.000Z	deebee_	Vj	in my opinion, not worth the hassle unless you have a specific reason to have it running natively. With a VM, you can snapshot it, roll back, etc. Plus, you can still use MacOS.
2011-10-14T06:13:00.000Z	deebee_	Vj	I use Eclipse for C++ work on my VM without a problem
2011-10-14T06:14:00.000Z	Vj	deebee_	what kind of specs are on your computer?
2011-10-14T06:15:00.000Z	deebee_	Vj	It's a 2009 MacBook Pro 15", so pretty good. However, I used to run a Ubuntu VM on my old MacBook Pro that was probably a 2005/6 model
2011-10-14T06:16:00.000Z	deebee_	Vj	If it's just for fun and a technical challenge, then go for it :)
2011-10-14T06:17:00.000Z	deebee_	Vj	Havent run Linux natively on a Mac for a long time. I did do it with refit years ago, but I'm sure it's all changed and I can't remember a thing :)
2011-10-14T06:18:00.000Z	Vj	deebee_	I've read that there are a lot of problems with refit and lion though
2011-10-14T06:19:00.000Z	deebee_	Vj	I wouldn't know, having not looked into it for a long time. You'll be lucky to find someone in here wanting to do the same as you, at the same time as you :)
2011-10-14T06:20:00.000Z	deebee_	Vj	Have you got VM software installed already? Why not give it a go and see how it performs?
2011-10-14T06:20:00.000Z	deebee_	Vj	Hope it goes well :)
