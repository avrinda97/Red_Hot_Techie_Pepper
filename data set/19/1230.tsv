2011-04-10T03:08:00.000Z	Bite		Hi guys.
2011-04-10T03:08:00.000Z	Bite		I'm having an issue with connecting to the network on my gnome desktop.
2011-04-10T03:08:00.000Z	Bite		Everytime i click "Wired Connection", and leave, then i come back and it's still disabled.
2011-04-10T03:08:00.000Z	benzaldehyde	Bite	which network, wireless network?
2011-04-10T03:09:00.000Z	Bite		ben: wired.
2011-04-10T03:09:00.000Z	Bite		I'm in the screen under ubuntu>admin>network.
2011-04-10T03:10:00.000Z	benzaldehyde	Bite	does it respond to command
2011-04-10T03:10:00.000Z	Bite		ben: Command? in what sense?
2011-04-10T03:10:00.000Z	benzaldehyde	Bite	sudo ifconfig eht0 up, sudo dhclient eth0
2011-04-10T03:11:00.000Z	benzaldehyde	Bite	and are all the lights solid
2011-04-10T03:11:00.000Z	Bite		Ben: It works now.
2011-04-10T03:12:00.000Z	Bite		are they temp fixes or permanent?
2011-04-10T03:13:00.000Z	Bite	benzaldehyde	temp or perm fixes?
2011-04-10T03:14:00.000Z	Bite		Best partition manager for ubuntu?
2011-04-10T03:15:00.000Z	benzaldehyde	Bite	well if you need to you could add the auto eth0, iface eth0 inet dhcp to your /etc/network/interfaces and possibly a pre-up /sbin/ifconfig eth0 up, post-up /sbin/dhclient eth0
2011-04-10T03:15:00.000Z	benzaldehyde	Bite	you could also add the commands to startup applications
2011-04-10T03:16:00.000Z	benzaldehyde	Bite	but i suspect it could have been the ISP dropping the connection, a reboot would give a definitive answer
2011-04-10T03:18:00.000Z	Bite	benzaldehyde	i've been having issues period.
2011-04-10T03:18:00.000Z	Bite	benzaldehyde	so this will prolly fix it.
