2005-06-29T13:08:00.000Z	ChinaCatJones		i am narrowing some issues on a clean install of 5.04 on a decrepit laptop, can someone take a look at this http://rafb.net/paste/results/SG1cfc20.html
2005-06-29T13:08:00.000Z	ChinaCatJones		the thing flickers like crazy
2005-06-29T13:08:00.000Z	dr_willis	ChinaCatJones	 the lcd screen flickers?
2005-06-29T13:09:00.000Z	ChinaCatJones	dr_willis	the lcd is fine, it looks more like a refresh issue
2005-06-29T13:10:00.000Z	ChinaCatJones	dr_willis	for example line 94 looks like it is call for true color, i'm fairly certain the card isn't up to it
2005-06-29T13:12:00.000Z	dr_willis	ChinaCatJones	 yea a lcd screen can only show about 16bit color.. an older lcd perhaps even worse.
2005-06-29T13:12:00.000Z	dr_willis	ChinaCatJones	 also they all use a refresh rate of 60hz (or was that mhz) i forget :P
2005-06-29T13:12:00.000Z	ChinaCatJones	dr_willis	this thing is Vintage pentium 200mmx
2005-06-29T13:13:00.000Z	dr_willis	ChinaCatJones	 i put Ubunto on my Pent100 Laptop. :P pent 1
2005-06-29T13:13:00.000Z	dr_willis	ChinaCatJones	 and yes it took FOREVER to install.
2005-06-29T13:13:00.000Z	dr_willis		and i highly suggest useing some very minimal window manager. Like Openbox. or windowmaker.  heh heh
2005-06-29T13:14:00.000Z	ChinaCatJones	dr_willis	I'm with you I spent the better part of a day getting a xircom card up and the better part of an afternoon installing
2005-06-29T13:14:00.000Z	dr_willis	ChinaCatJones	 may want to do a 'server' install and use the shell :P
2005-06-29T13:14:00.000Z	dr_willis		be hard core!\
2005-06-29T13:16:00.000Z	ChinaCatJones		actually that is sort of the plan, I am hoping to run a couple of light weight network services of the thing without x 99.9 percent of the time
2005-06-29T13:19:00.000Z	ChinaCatJones		no good deed goes unpunished
2005-06-29T13:19:00.000Z	dr_willis		perhaps her kid/son/cat got on the pc.
2005-06-29T13:21:00.000Z	ChinaCatJones	dr_willis	backing it down from 24 to 16 seems to do the trick
2005-06-29T13:27:00.000Z	ChinaCatJones	dr_willis	i am getting a whopping 22.5 fps on glxgears
