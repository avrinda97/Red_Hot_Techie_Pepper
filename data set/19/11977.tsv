2005-10-31T10:55:00.000Z	yi_		hi, how do i reinstall xorg? i accidentaly deleted some files
2005-10-31T10:55:00.000Z	yi_		i tried apt-get --reinstall xserver-xorg
2005-10-31T10:55:00.000Z	yi_		but that didn't seem to do the right things
2005-10-31T10:55:00.000Z	yi_		(i.e. not symlinking,e tc)
2005-10-31T10:56:00.000Z	NoUse	yi_	what files did you delete?
2005-10-31T10:56:00.000Z	yi_	NoUse	/usr/lib/X11R6
2005-10-31T10:57:00.000Z	yi_	NoUse	if i symlink Xorg to X
2005-10-31T11:01:00.000Z	NoUse	yi_	but if you just delete files dpkg doesn't know that its depencies are missing
2005-10-31T11:02:00.000Z	yi_	NoUse	ok so how do i get a clean xorg install
2005-10-31T11:03:00.000Z	NoUse	yi_	here is a list of packages that own files in /usr/lib/X11, try reinstalling them http://packages.ubuntu.com/cgi-bin/search_contents.pl?word=%2Fusr%2Flib%2FX11&searchmode=searchfilesanddirs&case=insensitive&version=breezy&arch=i386
2005-10-31T11:06:00.000Z	yi_	NoUse	hurmm it's a suid/permission problem i think
2005-10-31T11:08:00.000Z	NoUse	yi_	what kind of problem?
2005-10-31T11:08:00.000Z	yi_	NoUse	it can't move Xorg.log
2005-10-31T11:08:00.000Z	NoUse	yi_	maybe delete the log and let it recreate it
2005-10-31T11:09:00.000Z	NoUse	yi_	I think so but I'm not sure how
2005-10-31T11:13:00.000Z	yi_	NoUse	x works for root now, but not normal user
2005-10-31T11:14:00.000Z	NoUse	yi_	what error did you get when you try to run x as a user
2005-10-31T11:15:00.000Z	yi_	NoUse	"Cannot move old log file("/var/log/Xorg.log.0" to "/var/log/Xorg.log.0.old")
2005-10-31T11:15:00.000Z	NoUse	yi_	google that error
