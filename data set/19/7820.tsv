2012-05-27T05:36:00.000Z	Gumby	olskolirc	what more details would you like?  It worked, now it doesnt.  The only change I made was to edit the settings of a wifi network which I have now completely deleted.  I think my question stands, is there a way to reset or delete/re-add a wifi card from network manager

2012-05-27T05:41:00.000Z	olskolirc	Gumby	I'm reading that your card is unstable on Ubuntu.  This may pose as a good solution for you though http://askubuntu.com/questions/90077/ndiswrapper-driver-loaded-but-not-being-used
2012-05-27T05:41:00.000Z	olskolirc		what is your rhythmebox version LinuX2half
2012-05-27T05:41:00.000Z	Gumby	olskolirc	thats odd.  I've been using it for two years now with 0 issues whatsover
2012-05-27T05:41:00.000Z	olskolirc		old solutions are good solutions Gumby
2012-05-27T05:42:00.000Z	Gumby	olskolirc	the issue is not with the card.  It is a software issue, I believe the config to be corrupt.  I can boot a livecd of 12.04 and the card turns on without any problems
2012-05-27T05:42:00.000Z	olskolirc	Gumby	what happens if you pull the card out and put it back in
2012-05-27T05:42:00.000Z	olskolirc		hardware detection Gumby
2012-05-27T05:43:00.000Z	Gumby		what about it?
2012-05-27T05:43:00.000Z	Gumby		the hardware is detected
2012-05-27T05:43:00.000Z	Gumby		it is a matter of what state the OS is putting it in by default
2012-05-27T05:43:00.000Z	olskolirc		ndiswrapper or wicd-gtk would get it going again Gumby
2012-05-27T05:44:00.000Z	Gumby	olskolirc	if wicd-gtk would get it working then it isnt a hardware issue obviously.
