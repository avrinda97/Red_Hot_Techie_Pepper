2006-09-18T07:18:00.000Z	w30		I compiled a custom kernel and it has no screen output on bootup untill I see the nvidia splash screen and xdm login. What did I do wrong?
2006-09-18T07:19:00.000Z	w30		Is there a boot option I need to pas to the kernel?
2006-09-18T07:19:00.000Z	w30		pass
2006-09-18T07:19:00.000Z	cafuego	w30	No, I think you're just missing console support.
2006-09-18T07:20:00.000Z	w30	cafuego	that's weird, I made oldconfig
2006-09-18T07:21:00.000Z	cafuego	w30	Did you build the kernel with an initrd?
2006-09-18T07:21:00.000Z	cafuego	w30	For starters, remove the 'quiet' from the grub kernel line. That'll help.
2006-09-18T07:21:00.000Z	w30	cafuego	yes initrd is in
2006-09-18T07:22:00.000Z	w30	cafuego	ok I will try removing quiet
2006-09-19T12:22:00.000Z	cafuego	w30	Make fedora boot with "root=LABEL=core3" instead of root=LABEL=/
2006-09-19T12:23:00.000Z	cafuego	w30	You may need to also mount the fedora partition in ubuntu and edit Fedora's /etc/fstab to reflect that change.
2006-09-19T12:23:00.000Z	w30	cafuego	I tried that but Fedora still looks for /
2006-09-19T12:24:00.000Z	w30	cafuego	fstab don't list labels
2006-09-19T12:25:00.000Z	cafuego	w30	Just devices?
2006-09-19T12:26:00.000Z	w30	cafuego	just types ext3 vfat etc.
2006-09-19T12:28:00.000Z	w30	cafuego	I deleted the partiton and labeled it / but when I dd if=image of/dev/hda2 the label went back to core3 so the label is in the partition image somewhere
2006-09-19T12:28:00.000Z	cafuego	w30	Hmmyah. You can use 'tune2fs' to edit it.
2006-09-19T12:29:00.000Z	w30	cafuego	I deleted the partiton and labeled it / but when I dd if=image_core3  of=/dev/hda2 the label went back to core3 so the label is in the partition image somewhere
2006-09-19T12:34:00.000Z	w30	cafuego	tune2fs did the job, thank you profoundly!!!
