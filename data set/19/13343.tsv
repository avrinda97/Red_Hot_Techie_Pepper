2005-04-15T11:51:00.000Z	jnc		it's much easier for a portage system
2005-04-15T11:52:00.000Z	jnc		?
2005-04-15T11:53:00.000Z	jnc		i've tried the tutorials, nothing works perfectly yet
2005-04-15T11:54:00.000Z	jnc		farthest i got was built a package that installs the readme
2005-04-15T11:54:00.000Z	jnc		okay i for one vote that mdma_, distruptive as he/she is, be escorted out for a moment to cool off
2005-04-15T11:55:00.000Z	jnc		oh yea?
2005-04-15T11:55:00.000Z	jnc		that is a shock to come to debian packaging where it all sort of works
2005-04-15T11:56:00.000Z	jnc		making debian packages from scratch is terribly frustrating :(
2005-04-15T11:58:00.000Z	jnc		very straightforward automake/autoconf enabled code
2005-04-15T11:58:00.000Z	venkman	jnc	what is that, gaim with debugging symbols?
2005-04-15T11:59:00.000Z	venkman	jnc	have they ever tried rewriting gaim to use gtkmm?
2005-04-15T12:00:00.000Z	jnc	venkman	i doubt that would happen. look at gaim code, it is very efficient and structured like OOP
2005-04-15T12:00:00.000Z	venkman	jnc	it's pure c
2005-04-15T12:01:00.000Z	venkman	jnc	i write embeded software in pure c
2005-04-15T12:02:00.000Z	venkman	jnc	ruby is interesting, i still love java :/
2005-04-15T12:02:00.000Z	venkman	jnc	we need an efficient language with OO support and introspection.
2005-04-15T12:04:00.000Z	venkman	jnc	i think there could be some serious improvement to gtkmm, it looks like a pita to use.
2005-04-15T12:06:00.000Z	venkman	jnc	you might try #debian, most people in here i gather are ubuntu newbies or something along those lines..
2005-04-15T12:06:00.000Z	venkman	jnc	in gnome and gtk, there's no way to specify WHICH filechooser you want across all gtk/gnome apps is there/
