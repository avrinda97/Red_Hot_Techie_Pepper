2009-03-08T23:41:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tony__	why did you PM me the other night  regarding your checkpoint?
2009-03-08T23:41:00.000Z	tony__	sebsebseb	because you were away and thought i'd leave you a message
2009-03-08T23:41:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tony__	right, but I don't even remember talking to you about that
2009-03-08T23:42:00.000Z	tony__	sebsebseb	you said in #ubuntu you were able to help? unless I got the wrong person?
2009-03-08T23:42:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tony__	probably wrong person, but checkpoint is some sort of firewall?
2009-03-08T23:43:00.000Z	tony__	sebsebseb	correct, trying to get my sxn client to work with it
