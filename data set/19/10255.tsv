2006-10-10T14:26:00.000Z	jordan_	whyme	Did you hold down c?
2006-10-10T14:27:00.000Z	jordan_	whyme	Yes, when you boot the machine.
2006-10-10T14:29:00.000Z	jordan_	whyme	Do you plan on trying to dual boot OS 9?
2006-10-10T14:30:00.000Z	whyme	jordan_	jesus tap dancing christ! are you crazy?
2006-10-10T14:31:00.000Z	jordan_	whyme	Just checking because HFS+ resising still isn't great, as long as you are whiping the drive clean you should have no problems installing Ubuntu.
2006-10-10T14:32:00.000Z	jordan_	whyme	What mac is it again?
2006-10-10T14:33:00.000Z	whyme	jordan_	it's a powerbook G3, black
2006-10-10T14:35:00.000Z	jordan_	whyme	If it has a black keyboard, it's an old world mac, bronz, it's new world.
2006-10-10T14:36:00.000Z	jordan_	whyme	And if it has firewire then it is definately new world.
2006-10-10T14:37:00.000Z	whyme	jordan_	it's not even got usb... it's from '98
2006-10-10T14:38:00.000Z	jordan_	whyme	Then it's old world :(
2006-10-10T14:40:00.000Z	jordan_	whyme	I believe it is still possible to isntall though, I have just never done it.
2006-10-10T14:41:00.000Z	jordan_	whyme	I remember something about bootX.
2006-10-10T14:42:00.000Z	jordan_	whyme	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/OldWorldMacs
2006-10-10T14:49:00.000Z	jordan_	whyme	Are you still planning on installing Ubuntu?

2006-10-10T14:53:00.000Z	whyme	jordan_	yes I am... any other advice?
2006-10-10T14:57:00.000Z	jordan_	whyme	No, just have fun, I have never had to install on an old world mac, and from the looks of that page I hope I never will ;)
