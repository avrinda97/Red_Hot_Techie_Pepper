2009-01-30T16:57:00.000Z	SiDi	SAJMIRI	it would help to say if wifi/ethernet/usb, what ISP eventually, etc
2009-01-30T16:58:00.000Z	SiDi	SAJMIRI	does your adsl box have DHCP ?
2009-01-30T16:59:00.000Z	SAJMIRI	SiDi	iam a noob, in my other computer _vista_ i just put the cable and configure the ips and it is connected
2009-01-30T16:59:00.000Z	SiDi	SAJMIRI	it's meant to be exactly the same. Did you use any ISP cd on your windows PC ?
2009-01-30T16:59:00.000Z	SAJMIRI	SiDi	 no
2009-01-30T17:00:00.000Z	SiDi	SAJMIRI	then it should be exactly the same. You have a network icon (on the top right if i remember well), when you click it theres an "eth0" radio button, check it
2009-01-30T17:01:00.000Z	SiDi	SAJMIRI	when you try this, is there an error ? if you want to manually setup the IP then right click, "Modify connexions", click on "eth0", then the modify button, and go to the IPv4 tab to specify manual IP
2009-01-30T17:01:00.000Z	SAJMIRI	SiDi	yes i have checked it,and i have created a wired connection 1 ,puted the ips dsn and netmask ,click ok and i says to me is connected,but cannot open a page
2009-01-30T17:01:00.000Z	SiDi	SAJMIRI	can you try to ping your router please ?
2009-01-30T17:02:00.000Z	SAJMIRI	SiDi	i dont have a router
2009-01-30T17:02:00.000Z	SiDi	SAJMIRI	router = ADSL box
2009-01-30T17:02:00.000Z	SiDi	SAJMIRI	open and console and type "ping <box ip>" and tell me if it answers
2009-01-30T17:03:00.000Z	SAJMIRI	SiDi	no i dont have one,the isp gave me a cable ,it is like a lan cable and it comes from a wireless anntena
2009-01-30T17:04:00.000Z	SiDi	SAJMIRI	oh i see. Well they give you an IP for gateway, don't they ?
2009-01-30T17:04:00.000Z	SiDi	SAJMIRI	what if you ping google.com ?
2009-01-30T17:05:00.000Z	SAJMIRI	SiDi	should i try it now?
2009-01-30T17:05:00.000Z	SiDi	SAJMIRI	yes please
2009-01-30T17:05:00.000Z	SAJMIRI	SiDi	ok wait me some seconds
