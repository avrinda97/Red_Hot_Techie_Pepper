2008-05-24T22:45:00.000Z	jrib	Assid	you need to write everything on a single line
2008-05-24T22:45:00.000Z	jrib	Assid	how old? what version?
2008-05-24T22:45:00.000Z	jrib	Assid	ubottu's message answers your question then
2008-05-24T23:19:00.000Z	jrib	Assid	did you install ubuntu server?
2008-05-24T23:19:00.000Z	Assid	jrib	yeah i asked them to do that for me
2008-05-24T23:20:00.000Z	jrib	Assid	I'm not sure what you are asking.  X isn't installed in the server version
2008-05-24T23:20:00.000Z	Assid	jrib	right.. but i can optionally install it
2008-05-24T23:20:00.000Z	jrib	Assid	right, but why since it is headless?
2008-05-24T23:21:00.000Z	Assid	jrib	the person whose gonna admin it is umm.. not console savvy.. so i think i might have to get him a vnc access to it
2008-05-24T23:22:00.000Z	jrib	Assid	you don't need all of X for that afaik.  googling "headless ubuntu server vnc" turns up some promising results
