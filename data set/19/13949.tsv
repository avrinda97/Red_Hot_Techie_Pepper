2005-10-13T12:04:00.000Z	jeff_	TylerDurden	Use the backports if you want the newest version on hoary
2005-10-13T12:07:00.000Z	jeff_	TylerDurden	It is called logs, everything you type is logged for anyone else to read
2005-10-18T08:57:00.000Z	jeff_	TylerDurden	Why do you "Really need to install it"?
2005-10-18T08:59:00.000Z	jeff_	TylerDurden	Because you are new to linux. I listen to you on IRC. You are new to linux and dont know what you need. You just ask lots of questions
2005-10-18T08:59:00.000Z	jeff_	TylerDurden	What do you "Need a new kernel" for?
