2005-09-11T14:29:00.000Z	none_-		doesn't matter, ubuntu-desktop is not needed once it's installed
2005-09-11T14:29:00.000Z	none_-		why?
2005-09-11T14:31:00.000Z	Quinthius	none_-	ubuntu-desktop is a "meta" package, used to pull in other packages. if new packages are added to it, or rename, etc. then you won't get them if you don't have ubuntu-desktop..
2005-09-11T14:31:00.000Z	none_-		hmm, i see
2005-09-11T14:32:00.000Z	none_-		never used the default install before
2005-09-11T14:32:00.000Z	Quinthius	none_-	since upgrading goes by the packages you have... it may upgrade what you have, but there's no guarantee you're getting a "full" or proper upgrade
2005-09-11T14:32:00.000Z	none_-		right
2005-09-11T14:32:00.000Z	none_-		never thought about that
2005-09-11T14:33:00.000Z	none_-		ifconfig eth0 192.168.0.55 up
2005-09-11T14:33:00.000Z	none_-	f||bber	it will probably tell you
2005-09-11T14:33:00.000Z	Quinthius	none_-	but in general i think it's safe to not have ubuntu-desktop if you aren't upgrading... i would just re-add it before upgrading
