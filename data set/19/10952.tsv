2006-04-19T06:43:00.000Z	orbin	Paavo	lol, gtk1 app fonts are usually huge
2006-04-19T06:44:00.000Z	Paavo	orbin	well, I'd prefer that to this: http://jl.dy.fi/tinyfonts.png
2006-04-19T06:46:00.000Z	orbin	Paavo	er, is that pswd protected?
2006-04-19T06:47:00.000Z	Paavo	orbin	whoops, my bad. Try this: http://jl.dy.fi/shots/tinyfonts.png
2006-04-19T06:50:00.000Z	orbin	Paavo	definitely weird.  this is how it turns up for me:
2006-04-19T06:50:00.000Z	Paavo	orbin	Yep, that's what I've been used to seeing before on plain Debian.
2006-04-19T06:51:00.000Z	orbin	Paavo	have you tried beep-media-player? it's essentially xmms in gtk2
2006-04-19T06:51:00.000Z	orbin	Paavo	i only use xmms b/c i play music thru gkrellm

2006-04-19T06:56:00.000Z	orbin	Paavo	although, the last two packages seem to be obsolete
2006-04-19T06:56:00.000Z	orbin	Paavo	this one seems related: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=9945&highlight=gtk1+small
2006-04-19T06:59:00.000Z	Paavo	orbin	Yes, those people have the same problem, but as you said, the -transcoded packages seem to be obsolete.
2006-04-19T06:59:00.000Z	orbin	Paavo	and the first two are already intsalled right?
2006-04-19T07:02:00.000Z	Paavo	orbin	hmm, interesting. With "LC_CTYPE=POSIX xmms" the fonts are fine.
2006-04-19T07:04:00.000Z	Paavo	orbin	...and likewise with LC_CTYPE=fi_FI and fi_FI.utf8. So, could this result from the iso8859-15 encoded versions of the fonts being missing from Ubuntu?
2006-04-19T07:05:00.000Z	orbin	Paavo	dunno.  you went over my head w/ the CTYPE stuff tbh :)
2006-04-19T07:08:00.000Z	orbin	Paavo	http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=6921
2006-04-19T07:08:00.000Z	orbin	Paavo	what if you did the inverse of that and increased the number...
2006-04-19T07:16:00.000Z	orbin	Paavo	my guess is they're pushing for gtk2.  nobody bothered to make sure gtk1 apps look right
