2010-08-14T21:46:00.000Z	coolwhoami		what
2010-08-14T21:47:00.000Z	chrissharp123	coolwhoami	can you post any error messages?  if multiline, use http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/
2010-08-14T21:47:00.000Z	coolwhoami		Chrissharp123: sure give me a second
2010-08-14T21:56:00.000Z	coolwhoami		Chrissharp123: http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/YijBiqdD Here you go. Its been doing this since I first tried upgrading the packages
2010-08-14T21:56:00.000Z	chrissharp123	coolwhoami	ok - I'll take a look
2010-08-14T21:56:00.000Z	coolwhoami	chrissharp123	thanks
2010-08-14T22:00:00.000Z	chrissharp123	coolwhoami	I see one thing (that's not related to your dpkg errors) - the duplicate /etc/apt/sources.list entry - you can do 'sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list' and put a # in front of one of the lines with 'http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu/ lucid/partner Packages'
2010-08-14T22:01:00.000Z	chrissharp123	coolwhoami	regarding the other errors, have you tried 'sudo apt-get -f install' ?
2010-08-14T22:01:00.000Z	chrissharp123	coolwhoami	(btw - I'm making lunch - if you're patient with a delay, I'm happy to help :-))
2010-08-14T22:03:00.000Z	coolwhoami	chrissharp123	Not a problem at all, trying the command you suggested now
2010-08-14T22:06:00.000Z	coolwhoami	chrissharp123	Yeah i'm getting the same errors when I did that as before.
2010-08-14T22:31:00.000Z	chrissharp123	coolwhoami	try sudo apt-get --purge remove linux-image-2.6.32-24-generic python-pyatspi gnome-orca python-ubuntuone-client ubuntuone-client ubuntuone-client-gnome xulrunner-1.9.2
2010-08-14T22:33:00.000Z	coolwhoami	chrissharp123	It seems to be removing ok, I'm guesing when its done run the command you said earlier?
2010-08-14T22:40:00.000Z	chrissharp123	coolwhoami	if it removes without errors, try 'sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade'
2010-08-14T22:43:00.000Z	coolwhoami	chrissharp123	It ran cleanly and I ran those commands, however none of the packages we removed attempted to even install now.
2010-08-14T22:54:00.000Z	chrissharp123	coolwhoami	that's to be expected, probably.  You might do 'sudo apt-get install linux-image-2.6.32-24-generic python-pyatspi gnome-orca python-ubuntuone-client ubuntuone-client ubuntuone-client-gnome xulrunner-1.9.2' to get them back
2010-08-14T23:02:00.000Z	coolwhoami	chrissharp123	trying that now, thank you for the help :)
2010-08-14T23:05:00.000Z	coolwhoami	chrissharp123	Awesome! It installed cleanly. Thank you!
2010-08-14T23:07:00.000Z	chrissharp123	coolwhoami	you're welcome!  glad it worked out
