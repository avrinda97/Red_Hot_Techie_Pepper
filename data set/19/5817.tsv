2008-07-31T17:19:00.000Z	hubuntu		how do I add a user to the sudoers file?
2008-07-31T17:19:00.000Z	hubuntu		usermod -a -G sudo username
2008-07-31T17:19:00.000Z	hubuntu		?
2008-07-31T17:19:00.000Z	fde	hubuntu	no
2008-07-31T17:19:00.000Z	fde	hubuntu	visudo
2008-07-31T17:20:00.000Z	fde	hubuntu	yes... follow the syntax in the file already
2008-07-31T17:23:00.000Z	fde	hubuntu	It uses $EDITOR ... you're $EDITOR is just vim
2008-07-31T17:23:00.000Z	fde	hubuntu	what version of Ubuntu?
2008-07-31T17:23:00.000Z	hubuntu	fde	which file is it then?
2008-07-31T17:23:00.000Z	fde	hubuntu	I'd rather not say, you can screw things up if you edit it directly
2008-07-31T17:24:00.000Z	fde	hubuntu	visudo has some safeguards so you don't mess up
2008-07-31T17:30:00.000Z	hubuntu	fde	really just tell me the file I will make a backup and I can access directly as root so it won't get messed up
2008-07-31T17:30:00.000Z	fde	hubuntu	I warned you... /etc/sudoers
2008-07-31T17:31:00.000Z	fde	hubuntu	uncomment '%wheel' ... and edit /etc/groups and put yourself in the wheel group (append your username to the end of the line)
2008-07-31T17:32:00.000Z	fde	hubuntu	if you get confused... ASK
2008-07-31T17:33:00.000Z	fde	hubuntu	by 'uncomment' I mean ONLY remove the '#' in the line that has '%wheel ALL=ALL (ALL)'
2008-07-31T17:33:00.000Z	fde	hubuntu	there is NOPASSWD also, but that is insecure
2008-07-31T17:34:00.000Z	fde	hubuntu	then we can have no idea... ask #ebox perhaps?
2008-07-31T17:35:00.000Z	fde	hubuntu	Actually, I'd suggest that CentOS is the way... but choose what you will
