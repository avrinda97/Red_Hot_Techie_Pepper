2008-06-11T00:27:00.000Z	Kremlin[NA]		Hello, I just upgraded to 8.04 and when idle in system monitor my CPU usage is about 70%, thou no Processes are taking anything above 2%... Can anyone tell me what is happening?
2008-06-11T00:27:00.000Z	rampageoberon	Kremlin[NA]	in system monitor do View all processes and see what is using up the CPU
2008-06-11T00:28:00.000Z	rampageoberon	Kremlin[NA]	by default system monitor only shows you your processes, so you want to see all users processes
2008-06-11T00:29:00.000Z	Kremlin[NA]	rampageoberon	View -> All processes? there is xord at 7% and vinoserver at 12% thats all
2008-06-11T00:29:00.000Z	rampageoberon	Kremlin[NA]	70%?
2008-06-11T00:31:00.000Z	Kremlin[NA]	rampageoberon	yeah it is.. but strangely if I navigate away from the "resources" tab for a bit and then return I can see that when NOT having the resources tab open the CPU % drops to about 20%, but then returns to about 70% when I return to the "resources" tab
2008-06-11T00:31:00.000Z	rampageoberon	Kremlin[NA]	in my experience gnome-system-monitor takes a lot of CPU, to try something else install and try using htop in command line
2008-06-11T00:33:00.000Z	Kremlin[NA]	rampageoberon	if I quickly switch between resources and processes tab I can see that it is "Xorg" which is taking all the resources. But as I navigate away Xorg falls to sleep instantly
2008-06-11T00:33:00.000Z	rampageoberon	Kremlin[NA]	yes i get the same from Xorg occassionally, no idea what to do about it
2008-06-11T00:35:00.000Z	Kremlin[NA]	rampageoberon	Strange.. and I guess its only there when the resources tab is open :( Doesnt Xorg have something to do with the graptics? Could I be that I have a custom resolution or bad numbers in my custom res ?
2008-06-11T00:35:00.000Z	rampageoberon	Kremlin[NA]	Xorg is pretty much responsible for your desktop (X window sytem)
2008-06-11T00:36:00.000Z	rampageoberon	Kremlin[NA]	no idea about resoultions
2008-06-11T00:37:00.000Z	Kremlin[NA]	rampageoberon	Ahh ok, just seems so strange.. I dont want to CPu working at 70% 24/7 when its a server and is never turned off
2008-06-11T00:37:00.000Z	rampageoberon	Kremlin[NA]	if its a pure server you don't need the gui, see ubuntu server
2008-06-11T00:38:00.000Z	rampageoberon	Kremlin[NA]	my computer is never turned off too, it does take a lot of cpu occassionally but not alwaus
2008-06-11T00:42:00.000Z	Kremlin[NA]	rampageoberon	I know I dont but Im a total linux noob go I have the gui for configuring things hehe
2008-06-11T00:42:00.000Z	rampageoberon	Kremlin[NA]	fair enough but the server OS was made with no gui for a very good security reason
2008-06-11T00:43:00.000Z	rampageoberon	Kremlin[NA]	and the best way to learn is to use the command line, as using the gui is never the solution
2008-06-11T00:43:00.000Z	Kremlin[NA]	rampageoberon	Its only for personal NAS storage and private ftp.. all other ports are locked anyway so I dont think anyone would hack it anyway
