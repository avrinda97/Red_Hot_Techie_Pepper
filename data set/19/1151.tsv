2011-04-26T11:00:00.000Z	ecinxi	LAcan	it seems my gnome is broken. I've tried to reinstall it to no avail
2011-04-26T11:01:00.000Z	ecinxi	LAcan	I think so
2011-04-26T11:01:00.000Z	LAcan	ecinxi	when you boot, do your normal OS options come up?
2011-04-26T11:01:00.000Z	LAcan	ecinxi	ok and u pick windows and then...?
2011-04-26T11:02:00.000Z	LAcan	ecinxi	ok what happens when you pick ubuntu?
2011-04-26T11:03:00.000Z	ecinxi	LAcan	the disk drive for / is not ready yet or not present continue to wait or press s to skip mounting or m for manual recovery
2011-04-26T11:03:00.000Z	LAcan	ecinxi	try the windows option and tells me what happens, specifically please
2011-04-26T11:05:00.000Z	LAcan	ecinxi	hrmmm... are these OS' instaled on physically seperate drives or the same drive with partitions?
2011-04-26T11:06:00.000Z	LAcan	ecinxi	so windows is NOT booting either?
