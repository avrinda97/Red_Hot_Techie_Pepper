2010-06-14T11:08:00.000Z	paranoidphreak	binaryme	i dont believe my system supports virtualization
2010-06-14T11:07:00.000Z	binaryme	paranoidphreak	sometimes you need to adjust settings in you computer BIOS to enable VM extensions
2010-06-14T11:09:00.000Z	binaryme	paranoidphreak	then, unfortunately, you may have to stick with 32bit virtual machines
2010-06-14T11:11:00.000Z	binaryme	paranoidphreak	how much memory (RAM) does your system have?
2010-06-14T11:12:00.000Z	paranoidphreak	binaryme	about 4 gigs
2010-06-14T11:12:00.000Z	binaryme	paranoidphreak	I'm running a Dell Laptop (intel) and it does support 64 bit
2010-06-14T11:14:00.000Z	binaryme	paranoidphreak	The benefits of 64 only really com into play if you have more tha 4Gig (per OS), so you are not going to get a lot of benefit on that PC anyway
2010-06-14T11:17:00.000Z	paranoidphreak	binaryme	oh...i just want to run windows 7 in vm. currently, i'm running xp
2010-06-14T11:17:00.000Z	binaryme	paranoidphreak	and you have a 64bit version of Win7 i gather?
2010-06-14T11:18:00.000Z	paranoidphreak	binaryme	yeah, 64bit windows
2010-06-14T11:20:00.000Z	binaryme	paranoidphreak	ok, I see your problem..... It seems a little on to me that you PC doesn't support it if is capable of runnung a 64bit OS???
2010-06-14T11:20:00.000Z	binaryme	paranoidphreak	on = odd
2010-06-14T11:21:00.000Z	binaryme	paranoidphreak	is it worth double checking your bios for the option...  I know it is often of by default.
2010-06-14T11:21:00.000Z	paranoidphreak	binaryme	i went to this page: http://ark.intel.com/Product.aspx?id=37253 and it says it doesn't support VT-X
2010-06-14T11:21:00.000Z	binaryme	paranoidphreak	there is a setting in virtualbox that relates to this too.
2010-06-14T11:22:00.000Z	binaryme	paranoidphreak	ok, well, I guess that kinda kills the idea then?  Can you get hold a 32bit version of WIn7?
2010-06-14T11:27:00.000Z	paranoidphreak	binaryme	not @ the moment; i'm screwed. i guess i'll stick with xp for now and when i plan on getting a new system; i'm going to make sure it has virtualisation features. probably getting an amd system (more bang for the money)
2010-06-14T11:28:00.000Z	paranoidphreak	binaryme	thanks for your help anyways
2010-06-14T11:29:00.000Z	binaryme	paranoidphreak	you're welcome.  sorry I couldn't be of more help.
