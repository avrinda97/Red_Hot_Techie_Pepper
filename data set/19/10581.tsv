2006-06-01T12:17:00.000Z	Avian00		if nobody can answer my question here, can somebody please direct me to where I CAN get a response?
2006-06-01T12:18:00.000Z	Avian00		ubuntuforms won't give me up-to-date info
2006-06-01T12:18:00.000Z	Avian00		I have a vanilla CD instsasll of Dapper
2006-06-01T12:18:00.000Z	Avian00		I know my internet works
2006-06-01T12:19:00.000Z	Avian00		the only logical explination is that the repositories are down, can somebody confirm this?
2006-06-01T12:20:00.000Z	Avian00		I guess I can take that as I'm not the only having this problem
2006-06-01T12:21:00.000Z	Avian00		ok.  thanks midna
2006-06-01T12:21:00.000Z	Amaranth	Avian00	the repos are working fine for me
2006-06-01T12:21:00.000Z	Amaranth	Avian00	your mirror might be overloaded
2006-06-01T12:22:00.000Z	Avian00	Amaranth	how can I specify a different mirror?  I've been searching google and ubuntuforms for that without any luck
2006-06-01T12:22:00.000Z	Amaranth	Avian00	you have to manually edit your sources.list
2006-06-01T12:23:00.000Z	Avian00	Amaranth	where can I find a list of mirrors?
2006-06-01T12:23:00.000Z	Amaranth	Avian00	i dunno
2006-06-01T12:23:00.000Z	Amaranth	Avian00	i just use archive.ubuntu.com
2006-06-01T12:24:00.000Z	Avian00	Amaranth	that's the same one I'm using. some of them work, others do not
2006-06-01T12:26:00.000Z	Avian00	Amaranth	Thanks for your help
