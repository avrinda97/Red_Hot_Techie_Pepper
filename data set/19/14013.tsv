2004-11-22T13:15:00.000Z	|trey|	gen	doesn't run with sudo, would this be a bug?
2004-11-22T13:15:00.000Z	|trey|	gen	I had to change the command to that to use the tool yes...
2004-11-22T13:15:00.000Z	|trey|	gen	by default it doesn't issue sudo though...
2004-11-22T13:16:00.000Z	|trey|	gen	its already reported?

2004-12-21T17:22:00.000Z	|trey|	gen	depends if its in /etc/fstab ... if it is, 'mount /the/device'  else, 'mount -t ext3 /dev/hda1 /boot' for example
2004-12-21T17:22:00.000Z	gen	|trey|	what's the /boot for
2004-12-21T17:23:00.000Z	|trey|	gen	its an example of where in the fs you want to mount
2004-12-21T17:23:00.000Z	|trey|	gen	can be /some/where/all/the/way/out/here/if/you/want... just an example  :)
