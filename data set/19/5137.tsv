2008-08-25T02:55:00.000Z	hoonteke		anyone know how I might "duplicate" my wireless device?  I'm trying to be able to mess with my tapN devices as through iwconfig.  Any ideas/pointers?
2008-08-25T02:55:00.000Z	andycaz	hoonteke	you mean create two interfaces? like eth0 and eth0:0
2008-08-25T02:56:00.000Z	hoonteke	andycaz	sure, I think.  I thought tapN ws the way, but that would work to.  (What is that syntax?)
2008-08-25T02:56:00.000Z	hoonteke	andycaz	yes, I want to interfaces
2008-08-25T02:58:00.000Z	andycaz	hoonteke	then you need to go to /etc/network/interfaces and create that interface
2008-08-25T02:59:00.000Z	hoonteke	andycaz	hmm, do you have any pointer to some documentation on that?
2008-08-25T02:59:00.000Z	andycaz	hoonteke	take a look of this: http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/reference/ch-gateway.en.html search for eth0:0
2008-08-25T03:01:00.000Z	andycaz	hoonteke	remember to use your own interface names, for wireless i would presume its wlan0
2008-08-25T03:01:00.000Z	hoonteke	andycaz	sorry, I don't understand?
2008-08-25T03:02:00.000Z	andycaz	hoonteke	the example i gave you used eth0 and eth0:0 to create interface configuration. You said you need it for wireless, right? So you need to replace eth0 with your own interface, just a reminder for you
2008-08-25T03:02:00.000Z	andycaz	hoonteke	yup, no problem
2008-08-25T03:06:00.000Z	andycaz	hoonteke	did it work for you?
2008-08-25T03:09:00.000Z	hoonteke	andycaz	blast.  so this may be an issue of the driver and physical hardware, but I was hoping to have my wireless card be able to talk to two different wireless networks at the same time.
2008-08-25T03:11:00.000Z	andycaz	hoonteke	nope, that is impossible. A wifi card can be associated with only one station as far as i know
2008-08-25T03:13:00.000Z	hoonteke	andycaz	:-( But I can assign arbitrary mac addresses to devices
2008-08-25T03:15:00.000Z	andycaz	hoonteke	yes, you can change mac addresses for these virtual interfaces
2008-08-25T03:16:00.000Z	hoonteke	andycaz	yeah, but the underlying issue is still that the card would need to speak two different frequencies at the same time, right?
2008-08-25T03:16:00.000Z	andycaz	hoonteke	yup, and that is impossible as far as i know
2008-08-25T03:17:00.000Z	hoonteke	andycaz	:-)  I take that as a challenge!
