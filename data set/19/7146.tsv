2007-11-20T04:51:00.000Z	tushyd		anyone know why my wlan0 connects to a router but then drops it 5-10 seconds later? (happens on multiple routers)
2007-11-20T04:51:00.000Z	adac2	tushyd	which card do you have?
2007-11-20T04:52:00.000Z	tushyd	adac2	Intel 4965 AGN
2007-11-20T04:53:00.000Z	tushyd	adac2	any ideas?

2007-11-20T04:54:00.000Z	tushyd	adac2	nope, it was working for a while
2007-11-20T04:54:00.000Z	tushyd	adac2	but then all of a sudden it stopped working. It also won't switch from roaming mode
2007-11-20T04:55:00.000Z	tushyd		in the network manager
2007-11-20T04:55:00.000Z	adac2	tushyd	then i fear the card could be broken
2007-11-20T04:55:00.000Z	tushyd		but some routers work and some don't?
2007-11-20T04:55:00.000Z	adac2	tushyd	you didn√Ñt change the sestem?

2007-11-20T04:55:00.000Z	tushyd		I don't think so... I don't really know enough
2007-11-20T04:56:00.000Z	tushyd		maybe I will format and reinstall
2007-11-20T04:56:00.000Z	tushyd		or try a live cd
