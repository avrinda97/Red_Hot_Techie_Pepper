2010-04-22T22:16:00.000Z	devkhadka		my /var/www folder is own by www-data  and my user A is member of www-data group but A cannot see the contents of www-data the permission of /var/www  is set to 771 what is the problem
2010-04-22T22:16:00.000Z	devkhadka		if i set the permission to 777 only then it works
2010-04-22T22:17:00.000Z	BedMan	devkhadka	try 775, and make sure the group ownership is proper
2010-04-22T22:26:00.000Z	devkhadka	BedMan	sorry ufw is inactive
2010-04-22T22:17:00.000Z	devkhadka	BedMan	i used id A  and i can see A is member of www-data
2010-04-22T22:18:00.000Z	devkhadka	BedMan	the owner of /var/www is www-data and group is alos www-data
2010-04-22T22:19:00.000Z	devkhadka	BedMan	doesnot that  mean A shuld have all permission to /var/www read write ex
2010-04-22T22:20:00.000Z	BedMan	devkhadka	if A has a different primary group, then not exactly...
2010-04-22T22:20:00.000Z	BedMan	devkhadka	brb..
2010-04-22T22:24:00.000Z	BedMan	devkhadka	do you have a firewall set up? look into ufw man pages
2010-04-22T22:25:00.000Z	devkhadka	BedMan	ok i ll see
2010-04-22T22:27:00.000Z	BedMan	devkhadka	check to see if it's listening on your other interfaces with netstat -an | grep 3000
2010-04-22T22:38:00.000Z	devkhadka	BedMan	 tcp        0      0 *:3000                  *:*                     LISTEN      13083/ruby
2010-04-22T22:39:00.000Z	BedMan	devkhadka	well... sounds like it's open, next step is verifying your access to it
2010-04-22T22:44:00.000Z	devkhadka	BedMan	how do i verify it can you plz tell me
2010-04-22T22:45:00.000Z	BedMan	devkhadka	try telnet from another host to port 3000... if you get "connection refused" then something is blocking you
2010-04-22T22:51:00.000Z	devkhadka	BedMan	i can connect to port 8080 but not 3000 how do i provide access on that port
2010-04-22T22:57:00.000Z	BedMan	devkhadka	that's most likely the only things stopping you, unless your application uses tcp wrappers
2010-04-22T22:58:00.000Z	devkhadka	BedMan	ok i ll see it
