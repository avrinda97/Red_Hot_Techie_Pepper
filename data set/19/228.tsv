2012-06-09T07:52:00.000Z	rickger		Can anyone just tell me under what conditions will Ubuntu create the default /home folders? I really have no idea how this could of happened.
2012-06-09T07:53:00.000Z	rickger		Or why it would create them in the ecryptfs
2012-06-09T07:55:00.000Z	sacarlson	rickger	when you create a new user you select if you want his /home/user dir to be encrytped,  this also is asked at first install of ubuntu for an admin account
2012-06-09T07:56:00.000Z	rickger	sacarlson	well then I have no clue what happened. Ubuntu just decided to remake those folders in the encrypfs
2012-06-09T07:57:00.000Z	sacarlson	rickger	there is a box to check in the user group gui that is used to select weather it's encyrpted or not
2012-06-09T07:58:00.000Z	rickger	sacarlson	yeah but what I'm saying is that this user and it's encryptfs already existed. But ubuntu re-created the default folders in the home directory and the encrypfs even though they already existed
2012-06-09T07:58:00.000Z	sacarlson	rickger	from an upgrade?  you can unencrypt the user or just create a new user that isn't encrypted and copy the /home/user to the new one
2012-06-09T08:00:00.000Z	rickger	sacarlson	once I removed the default folders from the encrypfs and rebooted, I could access the folders again
2012-06-09T08:00:00.000Z	rickger	sacarlson	No mention of anything in the logs about this
2012-06-09T08:01:00.000Z	sacarlson	rickger	I've never seen it before.  maybe look at your apt-get log to see what you might have installed to triger the event
2012-06-09T08:03:00.000Z	sacarlson	rickger	see  /var/log/dpkg.log to see your history around the time you see the changes
2012-06-09T08:08:00.000Z	rickger	sacarlson	I can't see anything that would cause it to re-create the default /home folders in the /home/user/.Private/ folder
2012-06-09T08:08:00.000Z	sacarlson	rickger	auto update set?
2012-06-09T08:09:00.000Z	rickger	sacarlson	nope
2012-06-09T08:09:00.000Z	sacarlson	rickger	I'm clueless sorry
2012-06-09T08:09:00.000Z	rickger	sacarlson	last upgrades were 2 days ago
2012-06-09T08:10:00.000Z	sacarlson	rickger	oh that sounds like a match then it's linked to upgrade
2012-06-09T08:11:00.000Z	sacarlson	rickger	I disable all that auto upgrade stuf for this type of reason
2012-06-09T08:12:00.000Z	rickger	sacarlson	yeah, but I don't get why an update would do this anyways.
