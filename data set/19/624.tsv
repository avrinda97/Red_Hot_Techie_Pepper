2012-04-06T02:26:00.000Z	TRAVISg		Problem with Chromium in ubuntu 11.10. Won't start terminal says. Segmentation fault refers to apps/chromium.rc not existing
2012-04-06T02:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TRAVISg	what is the output of:  lsb_release -sc
2012-04-06T02:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TRAVISg	you could try:    mv ~/.config/chromium ~/.config/chromium_old       then rerun the browser
2012-04-06T02:33:00.000Z	TRAVISg	ActionParsnip	it's running starts do you want output?
2012-04-06T02:33:00.000Z	TRAVISg	ActionParsnip	doesn't look quite right
2012-04-06T02:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TRAVISg	run the browser now and you will have a default profile, does it run ok?
2012-04-06T02:36:00.000Z	TRAVISg	ActionParsnip	no it starts but when I try to sign in it quits would you like the output?
2012-04-06T02:37:00.000Z	TRAVISg	ActionParsnip	now it is back to not opening at all
2012-04-06T02:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TRAVISg	strange, you can rename the old profile back if you want the old profile back :), I'd report a bug
2012-04-06T02:38:00.000Z	TRAVISg	ActionParsnip	never done that don't know how
2012-04-06T02:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TRAVISg	run:   ubuntu-bug chromium-browser
2012-04-06T02:40:00.000Z	TRAVISg	ActionParsnip	entered ubuntu-bug chromium-browser  output was segmentation fault. Is that what I wanted?
2012-04-06T02:54:00.000Z	TRAVISg	ActionParsnip	Tried running ubuntu-bug chromium-browser it just said segmentation fault
2012-04-06T02:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TRAVISg	oh man, not good
2012-04-06T02:56:00.000Z	TRAVISg	ActionParsnip	Okay I am sweating now... Fresh install time?
2012-04-06T02:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TRAVISg	reinstall.....for a browser...?
2012-04-06T02:58:00.000Z	TRAVISg	ActionParsnip	I thought that the failure to be able to report the bug might mean that there is a bigger problem
2012-04-06T02:59:00.000Z	TRAVISg	ActionParsnip	I am not very knowledgeable...yet
2012-04-06T02:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TRAVISg	there is a web interface you can use
