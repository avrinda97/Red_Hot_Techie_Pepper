2007-07-24T08:36:00.000Z	wbadger	CHA0Xm1nd	if you want to be sure, open a terminal and write: "glxinfo | grep direct"
2007-07-24T08:37:00.000Z	wbadger	CHA0Xm1nd	what does it say ?
2007-07-24T08:37:00.000Z	CHA0Xm1nd	wbadger	Direct rendering: yes

2007-07-24T08:40:00.000Z	CHA0Xm1nd	wbadger	hehe well i have used other distros before, and as far as i remembered drivers was hell :-P
2007-07-24T08:41:00.000Z	wbadger	CHA0Xm1nd	it is not hell, but since ubuntu 7.04 there's that restricted drivers manager and now it is real easy (usually hehe) :)
