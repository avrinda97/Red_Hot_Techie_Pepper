2006-12-03T13:30:00.000Z	JoshJ		seems like it would be mplayer

2006-12-03T13:31:00.000Z	screechingcat	JoshJ	mplayer doesnt do all the encoding and ripping features that mencoder gives
2006-12-03T13:32:00.000Z	screechingcat	JoshJ	mplayer is just for playing media

2006-12-03T13:40:00.000Z	JoshJ	screechingcat	no reason to use Warez if FOSS is available
2006-12-03T13:41:00.000Z	screechingcat	JoshJ	naah! im not a FOSS addict. i just need the best program for the job
2006-12-03T13:43:00.000Z	screechingcat	JoshJ	a driver manager, antivirus, antispyware, nero, and some video editing software and games

2006-12-03T13:47:00.000Z	screechingcat	JoshJ	yeah, the often underestimated kid brother of sourceforge
