2009-11-02T16:11:00.000Z	onUbunt-Live		i did upgrade from grub to grub2. instructions from https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Grub2
2009-11-02T16:11:00.000Z	onUbunt-Live		i have 3 HDD: sda(win XP); sdb (data);sdc ubuntu
2009-11-02T16:11:00.000Z	onUbunt-Live		when i start PC i get "Error 15" from Grub
2009-11-02T16:12:00.000Z	Gnea	onUbunt-Live	make sure you install grub to the MBR of the hard drive, not the MBR of a partition
2009-11-02T16:15:00.000Z	Gnea	onUbunt-Live	you need to understand the difference between a hard drive and a partition first
2009-11-02T16:17:00.000Z	onUbunt-Live	Gnea	i think i know it. example sda=HD; sda1=partition. right?
2009-11-02T16:20:00.000Z	Gnea	onUbunt-Live	yes.
2009-11-02T16:20:00.000Z	Gnea	onUbunt-Live	so when you install grub, it must install to sda, not sda1 or sda2...
2009-11-02T16:20:00.000Z	onUbunt-Live	Gnea	i did that
2009-11-02T16:21:00.000Z	Gnea	onUbunt-Live	good.
2009-11-02T16:21:00.000Z	Gnea	onUbunt-Live	i'm not sure what else to suggest...
2009-11-02T16:22:00.000Z	onUbunt-Live	Gnea	if sda is win and sdc is ubuntu...does it matter on witch one i install?
2009-11-02T16:23:00.000Z	Gnea	onUbunt-Live	yes, it must be sdc
2009-11-02T16:23:00.000Z	onUbunt-Live	Gnea	oky..i will remake everything
2009-11-02T16:24:00.000Z	Gnea	onUbunt-Live	good luck
