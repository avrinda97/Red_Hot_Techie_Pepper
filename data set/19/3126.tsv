2009-10-23T16:29:00.000Z	Guest36729		This is my problem: Whenever I click on any link, when the page loading ends... The URL in the address field remains the same.
2009-10-23T16:30:00.000Z	Guest36729		It doesn't let me go forward or back either.
2009-10-23T16:30:00.000Z	Guest36729		And it doesn't save my bookmarks or history
2009-10-23T16:30:00.000Z	Guest36729		I can't access them.
