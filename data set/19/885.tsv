2012-05-25T14:05:00.000Z	samuel		yes, i'm happy with the hostname, i only want to change what it says from the desktop
2012-05-25T14:05:00.000Z	samuel		yes, thats right
2012-05-25T14:06:00.000Z	samuel		in 12.04 it appears that when you have no active windows, the top panel reads "ubuntu desktop"
2012-05-25T14:06:00.000Z	samuel		i want to change it for the purposes of debranding
2012-05-25T14:07:00.000Z	samuel		i have previously been using a different distro which came with debranding but it seems that since 11.10 they havnt bothered, which is a problem for me
2012-05-25T14:08:00.000Z	samuel		yes i mean apart from the icons, i mean when you first log in, before you have loaded anything it just says "ubuntu desktop" that is obviously a problem if you cannot ship ubuntu vanilla for legal reasons
2012-05-25T14:08:00.000Z	samuel		not with proprietary software preinstalled
2012-05-25T14:09:00.000Z	samuel		we have previously been using linux mint, but the changes in their desktop shell means inconsistancies with the interface - unity offers the best for that
2012-05-25T14:09:00.000Z	samuel		i have tried debrandbuntu but it does not load the 12.04 iso
2012-05-25T14:10:00.000Z	samuel		besides, this is surely something that is in a config file somewhere, it cant be in compiled code can it??
2012-05-25T14:11:00.000Z	auronandace	samuel	let me get this straight, you want to remove the branding and make a derivative?
2012-05-25T14:12:00.000Z	auronandace	samuel	what's stopping you?
2012-05-25T14:13:00.000Z	auronandace	samuel	so am i right in concluding you want to make a derivative of ubuntu?
2012-05-25T14:14:00.000Z	auronandace	samuel	so what is the point of debranding unless you want to create a derivative?
2012-05-25T14:15:00.000Z	auronandace	samuel	because...
2012-05-25T14:17:00.000Z	auronandace	samuel	ah, so you are making a derivative then, since you are redistributing it with hardware
2012-05-25T14:17:00.000Z	auronandace	samuel	that is beyond the scope of this channel
2012-05-25T14:19:00.000Z	auronandace	samuel	mint doesn't use unity and isn't supported here either
2012-05-25T14:20:00.000Z	auronandace	samuel	then you'd need to ask for help in the mint channel
