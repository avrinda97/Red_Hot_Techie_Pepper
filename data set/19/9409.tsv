2008-10-12T03:11:00.000Z	Iceman_B^Ltop		hmm
2008-10-12T03:12:00.000Z	Iceman_B^Ltop		okay, so, no matter what I do
2008-10-12T03:12:00.000Z	Iceman_B^Ltop		the grapical mode of Ubuntu is not liked by my monitor
2008-10-12T03:12:00.000Z	Iceman_B^Ltop		is there any way I can force a resolution and refreshrate during the install, when I boot from the live cd ?
2008-10-12T03:13:00.000Z	Scunizi	Iceman_B^Ltop	you might need to use the "Alternate" installer.. available at www.ubuntu.com
2008-10-12T03:13:00.000Z	Iceman_B^Ltop	Scunizi	thats whaty merkoth also suggested, but I wonder if that'll solve the problem
2008-10-12T03:14:00.000Z	Scunizi	Iceman_B^Ltop	what kind of vid card?
2008-10-12T03:15:00.000Z	Iceman_B^Ltop	Scunizi	hurr...good question
2008-10-12T03:16:00.000Z	Scunizi	Iceman_B^Ltop	so nvidia.. It may be a quirk with the motherboard.. that's why the alternate installer is sometimes preferred.. once installed activate the restricted drivers for nvidia and possibly install nvidia-settings to work out the kinks.
2008-10-12T03:17:00.000Z	Iceman_B^Ltop	Scunizi	hmm, perhaps. I hope I'll get that far graphically to actually install those settings
2008-10-12T03:18:00.000Z	Scunizi	Iceman_B^Ltop	good luck.. I gotta run.. there's always help here of varying degrees depending on the time of day.
2009-02-28T08:52:00.000Z	Scunizi	Iceman_B^Ltop	/etc/apache2
2009-02-28T08:59:00.000Z	Scunizi	Iceman_B^Ltop	you don't see the love yet.. irssi is a great client
2009-02-28T09:00:00.000Z	Iceman_B^Ltop	Scunizi	I was raised with mIRC...so irssi takes a while to grow on me
2009-02-28T09:00:00.000Z	Scunizi	Iceman_B^Ltop	there are themes to make it look like mIRC.. :)
2009-02-28T09:01:00.000Z	Iceman_B^Ltop	Scunizi	the only thing I want is a persistant nicklist, which is non-buggy
2009-02-28T09:02:00.000Z	Scunizi	Iceman_B^Ltop	I never found the need for a nick list..
2009-02-28T09:02:00.000Z	Iceman_B^Ltop	Scunizi	I want to be able to quickly see who is and who isnt in a channel
2009-02-28T09:02:00.000Z	Scunizi	Iceman_B^Ltop	 might be nice for smaller channels but here with 1200+ .. eh. not for me.
