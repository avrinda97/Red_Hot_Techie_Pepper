2009-12-25T09:39:00.000Z	alankila	Heth	you can probably just make something like "options.conf" and it will just pick it up automatically.
2009-12-25T09:40:00.000Z	Heth	alankila	on the original it's only "options" and it did not work
2009-12-25T09:40:00.000Z	alankila	Heth	that's how modprobe.d stuff is supposed to work, anyway... independent configuration files.
2009-12-25T09:40:00.000Z	alankila	Heth	I'm not sure about the suffix, but the other files in that directory all end in .conf, so I suggest yours do as well.
2009-12-25T09:41:00.000Z	Heth	alankila	thanks I'll try that now :)
2009-12-25T09:41:00.000Z	alankila	Heth	there is some sensitivity to the exact name because old files are left around with names like foo.conf.dpkg-old and it's undesirable that they get executed.
2009-12-25T09:42:00.000Z	alankila	Heth	also, as an emergency workaround you should be able to rmmod the module and then modprobe it with the right option so you can always get past this problem even if passing the option automatically didn't work right now...
2009-12-25T09:43:00.000Z	Heth	alankila	mhm. I have a file named "options.dpkg-bak with my old settings.
2009-12-25T09:43:00.000Z	alankila	Heth	just rename that to options.conf then...
2009-12-25T09:54:00.000Z	Heth	alankila	is there a way to make modprobe.d reload that file now? I made the .conf
2009-12-25T09:55:00.000Z	alankila	Heth	don't know, sadly. Try to rmmod the module and modprobe it in right after
2009-12-25T10:08:00.000Z	Heth	alankila	sadly this module is no longer used. they use CRDA now which is not working for me for some reason
2009-12-25T10:08:00.000Z	alankila	Heth	ow, that complicated matters, I guess
2009-12-25T10:08:00.000Z	Heth	alankila	indeed.
2009-12-25T10:19:00.000Z	Heth	alankila	is there a way I can see a log from modprobe on parsing that line?
2009-12-25T10:19:00.000Z	alankila	Heth	you perhaps need a crash course on modutils
2009-12-25T10:19:00.000Z	alankila	Heth	the options line is useless if there is no module to use the option you painstakingly set up
2009-12-25T10:20:00.000Z	Heth	alankila	I'm still not sure about if it exists or not, that's why i need to see the logs since there should be noted
2009-12-25T10:20:00.000Z	alankila	Heth	well, try dmesg, maybe it has a clue. Try to lsmod, grep for the module name.
