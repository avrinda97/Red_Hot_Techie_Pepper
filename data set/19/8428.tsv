2007-05-21T12:25:00.000Z	Azzkikr	JinRoh	check within Ubuntu: go to the menu System -> Preferences -> Preferred Applications
2007-05-21T12:25:00.000Z	JinRoh	Azzkikr	 what there?
2007-05-21T12:25:00.000Z	Azzkikr	JinRoh	there is an option to open a link in a new tab. Perhaps that solves it
2007-05-21T12:25:00.000Z	JinRoh		oh I got it
2007-05-21T12:25:00.000Z	JinRoh		Will try Thx
