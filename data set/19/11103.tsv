2012-04-10T12:23:00.000Z	tanath		deadbeef ought to be added to the list for audio. it's about the only thing that'll play virtually everything
2012-04-10T12:24:00.000Z	tanath		though audacious is good too and comes close
2012-04-10T12:24:00.000Z	sw	tanath	update it then
2012-04-10T12:24:00.000Z	tanath	sw	update the list? i'm not an op
2012-04-10T12:24:00.000Z	tanath	sw	just a random visitor...
2012-04-10T12:25:00.000Z	sw	tanath	anyone can submit requests, ops just need to approve them - <ubottu> Your edit request has been forwarded to #ubuntu-ops.  Thank you for your attention to detail
2012-04-10T12:26:00.000Z	tanath	sw	hrm
2012-04-10T12:26:00.000Z	tanath	sw	so how would one go about that then?
2012-04-10T12:27:00.000Z	sw	tanath	tell the bot
2012-04-10T12:27:00.000Z	tanath	sw	can i tell it xine is crap, and smplayer should replace it in video list? :P
2012-04-10T12:27:00.000Z	sw	tanath	message it with: '<trigger> is <...>'
2012-04-10T12:29:00.000Z	tanath	sw	so you'd send 'is <edited version here>'?
2012-04-10T12:30:00.000Z	tanath	sw	i don't think a restart is needed there, just logging out
2012-04-10T12:30:00.000Z	sw	tanath	you'd send: 'tanath is a user in the #ubuntu IRC channel', and then when !tanath is triggered, you'll see <ubottu> sw: tanath is a user in the #ubuntu IRC channel
2012-04-10T12:31:00.000Z	tanath	sw	so yes, full edited version. ty
2012-04-10T12:31:00.000Z	sw	tanath	yes, because it overwrites what's already there - it's a bot, not a scientist
2012-04-10T12:31:00.000Z	tanath	sw	i was under impression it'll be reviewed first though
2012-04-10T12:32:00.000Z	sw	tanath	it will, but you need to use the full version, edit it, and paste the new full version
2012-04-10T12:32:00.000Z	tanath	sw	yeah got that. that was my question, which you answered
