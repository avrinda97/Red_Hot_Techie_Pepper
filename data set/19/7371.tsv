2009-01-07T06:18:00.000Z	Gokul		I'm having this issue where the netwrok manager on my Ubuntu 8.10 shows only the wireless network i'm connected to and does not display all the other available wireless connections
2009-01-07T06:18:00.000Z	Gokul		anyone have any suggestions as to how I could fix it?

2009-01-07T06:21:00.000Z	gogereaver	Gokul	its not supposed to
2009-01-07T06:21:00.000Z	gogereaver	Gokul	it should only list them in the network manager when you scan for new ones
2009-01-07T06:22:00.000Z	Gokul	gogereaver	how do i scan for new ones then?
2009-01-07T06:23:00.000Z	gogereaver		 Gokul KWifiManager  is one i knoe of
2009-01-07T06:24:00.000Z	gogereaver		the one ubuntu has by defult just does it auto
2009-01-07T06:24:00.000Z	gogereaver		best one it can find
2009-01-07T06:24:00.000Z	Gokul	gogereaver	it seems obvious that at any time, i'd like to switch from one wireless connection to another one. not having the list of available connections makes it fdifficult to do so
2009-01-07T06:24:00.000Z	gogereaver		KWifiManager gives a list
2009-01-07T06:25:00.000Z	Gokul		i'm using gnome and prefer not to install kwifimanager if i can avoid it
2009-01-07T06:25:00.000Z	gogereaver		isudo apt-get install wifi-radar
2009-01-07T06:26:00.000Z	Gokul		surely there's got to be some way of listing all the avilable wireless connections using the network-manager applet
2009-01-07T06:26:00.000Z	gogereaver	Gokul	wifi0radio is a nice gui
2009-01-07T06:26:00.000Z	gogereaver		it will scan and even tell you if there open or not
2009-01-07T06:27:00.000Z	Gokul		that *IS* the problem. before i connect, it lists all of them but once i connect to one of them, the lists seems to dissapper after a few mins
2009-01-07T06:28:00.000Z	gogereaver	Gokul	well its supposed to do that
2009-01-07T06:28:00.000Z	gogereaver	Gokul	if you disconnect the list should come back
