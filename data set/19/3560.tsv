2009-07-24T20:11:00.000Z	Pici	Leoneof	Why do you think you aren't logged in as root when you use sudo -i/-s ?
2009-07-24T20:11:00.000Z	Leoneof		i want to access and copy inside usr/src
2009-07-24T20:11:00.000Z	Pici	Leoneof	And sudo will allow you to do that, what leads you to believe  that you don't have that access when you use the aformentioned commands?
