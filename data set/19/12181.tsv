2006-12-01T12:26:00.000Z	mister_roboto	vmware	you're gonna have to compile it from source
2006-12-01T12:27:00.000Z	vmware		thanks, mister_roboto. i've got it installed. i've had it for ages infact. i just don't understand how anyone ever knows how to use it lol
2006-12-01T12:27:00.000Z	mister_roboto	vmware	it's pretty easy actually :)
2006-12-01T12:27:00.000Z	mister_roboto	vmware	and very cool.   i use it on a thumbdrive that gets mounted on windows and linux both
2006-12-01T12:28:00.000Z	mister_roboto	vmware	read their online docs. explains things very well
2006-12-01T12:28:00.000Z	vmware		lol, well i've spent months thinking about trying to get it working, but i just can't do it for some reason, yes, that's it - all the tuts are for thumbdrives, i want to encrypt a directory
2006-12-01T12:28:00.000Z	vmware	mister_roboto	^^
2006-12-01T12:29:00.000Z	mister_roboto	vmware	if you're a little put off by the linux command line tool, try the windows gui for creating your encrypted volume from a file.
2006-12-01T12:29:00.000Z	vmware	mister_roboto	i'll look through the docs again, it just starts getting more and more comlicated when i start reading, i haven't actuaclly run a command yet.
2006-12-01T12:29:00.000Z	mister_roboto	vmware	they have a quick start guide that will have you mounting an encrypted volume in about 10 minutes, tops
2006-12-01T12:30:00.000Z	mister_roboto	vmware	just do it, do it as you're reading the quick start guide
2006-12-01T12:30:00.000Z	mister_roboto	vmware	it will make sense once you do it :)
2006-12-01T12:30:00.000Z	vmware		i'm not put off by CLI, i use linux every day, i just have a problem with truecrypt. i'll read the docs lol thanks for the help :)
2006-12-01T12:30:00.000Z	vmware	mister_roboto	^^
2006-12-01T12:31:00.000Z	mister_roboto	vmware	if you're still stuck, i can hold your hand through it later  :)
2006-12-01T12:31:00.000Z	mister_roboto	vmware	just not now
2006-12-01T12:32:00.000Z	vmware	mister_roboto	8) i'll try running a command first, i haven't ever manged to get started, i get put off. i should be fine in VM anyway if i make a mistake
