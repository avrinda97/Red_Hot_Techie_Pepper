2006-06-04T13:31:00.000Z	facefacefaceface		wow... I had this computer for 3 weeks...
2006-06-04T13:31:00.000Z	facefacefaceface		Development Branch
2006-06-04T13:31:00.000Z	facefacefaceface		some body sold me the computer - it cam e with ubuntu
2006-06-04T13:32:00.000Z	facefacefaceface		ok, I just remembered what I came in hear to ask
2006-06-04T13:32:00.000Z	facefacefaceface		what is the deal with /tmp? why does it look green?
2006-06-04T13:34:00.000Z	facefacefaceface		if I left a file in tmp, and did a reboot, it should still be there?
2006-06-04T13:34:00.000Z	facefacefaceface		I wondered if green meant 'virtual'
2006-06-04T13:35:00.000Z	facefacefaceface		their is nothing 'special' about /tmp under ubuntu vs FC for example?
2006-06-04T13:35:00.000Z	facefacefaceface		I thought I had a file under /tmp, now I can't find it
2006-06-04T13:36:00.000Z	facefacefaceface		how can I search for the file which I thought was under /tmp?
2006-06-04T13:37:00.000Z	earthen	facefacefaceface	locate "name of file"
2006-06-04T13:37:00.000Z	earthen	facefacefaceface	you may want to do a updatedb first
2006-06-04T13:37:00.000Z	facefacefaceface	earthen	how long will that take?
2006-06-04T13:38:00.000Z	earthen	facefacefaceface	 2-3 minuts maybe
2006-06-04T13:39:00.000Z	facefacefaceface	earthen	? can you help ... updatedb: fatal error: You are not authorized to create a default slocate database
2006-06-04T13:39:00.000Z	earthen	facefacefaceface	sudo updatedb
2006-06-04T13:40:00.000Z	earthen	facefacefaceface	you have to be root to do that
2006-06-04T13:40:00.000Z	facefacefaceface	earthen	is the sudo pwd just my pwd?
2006-06-04T13:40:00.000Z	earthen	facefacefaceface	yes
