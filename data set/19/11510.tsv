2006-12-04T13:43:00.000Z	b1shop		anyone have beagle working with evolution with exchange as backend server?
2006-12-04T13:43:00.000Z	MarcN	b1shop	I think I do.  I use exchange as my backend.
2006-12-04T13:44:00.000Z	b1shop	MarcN	does it index your email?  it not grabbing mine
2006-12-04T13:46:00.000Z	MarcN	b1shop	unclear.  Some email (like ones I've sent are indexed), but new read mail doesn't appear to be.  Beagle does beat on my cpu indexing stuff right now.
2006-12-04T13:47:00.000Z	MarcN	b1shop	could also be that email is found via the thunderbird route too I suppose.  Evo uses exchange backend, thunderbird uses imap to exchange.
2006-12-04T13:47:00.000Z	b1shop	MarcN	odd.  i'm running beagle-status in a terminal while i'm working.  only thing it seems to be picking up are webpages.  no email
2006-12-04T13:48:00.000Z	MarcN	b1shop	beagle is busy with the gaim logs (seems suboptimal)  If I exchange irc chat it calms down.
2006-12-04T13:52:00.000Z	MarcN	b1shop	beagle is finding a bunch of my email via thunderbird (via IMAP),
2006-12-04T13:53:00.000Z	b1shop	MarcN	yup.  i just created an imap connection with thunderbird and it's indexing everything
2006-12-04T13:54:00.000Z	b1shop	MarcN	odd.  i see posts on various sites that say beagle works with evolution and exchange as a connector
2006-12-04T13:54:00.000Z	MarcN	b1shop	don't see email I've read only with evolution (except email I've sent) which is on the local disk.  Doesn't seem to look at stuff on exchange inbox
2006-12-04T13:55:00.000Z	MarcN	b1shop	I leave my email on the server.
2006-12-04T13:55:00.000Z	b1shop	MarcN	hm.  i'm on a laptop.. so i do archive a copy locally (still ont he server)
2006-12-04T13:56:00.000Z	MarcN	b1shop	I suppose if you want to.  I just leave stuff there and not pull it to the laptop.
2006-12-04T13:58:00.000Z	MarcN	b1shop	I've used evolution for years and still my favorite command a few times a day is:            `locate killev`
2006-12-04T13:59:00.000Z	b1shop	MarcN	lol.  yup
2006-12-04T13:59:00.000Z	b1shop	MarcN	i found an irc chan dedicated to it from the faq on the website.  checking on it now
2006-12-04T14:05:00.000Z	b1shop	MarcN	the official answer is NO.. it does not work @ this time
2006-12-04T14:06:00.000Z	MarcN	b1shop	keep thunderbird running somewhere ;-)
