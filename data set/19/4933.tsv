2011-07-02T20:20:00.000Z	morth		im having an issue, when i connect with VPN it works for my internet browser but when my irssi can't connect, always saying timed out.
2011-07-02T20:21:00.000Z	yeats	morth	there should be a setting in network manager that tells ubuntu not to route everything through the VPN connection
2011-07-02T20:23:00.000Z	morth	yeats	errrm how can i tell LOL
2011-07-02T20:23:00.000Z	yeats	morth	how did you set up the VPN connection?
2011-07-02T20:24:00.000Z	morth	yeats	using ubuntu 11.04, the two arrows on my top panel
2011-07-02T20:24:00.000Z	morth	yeats	then i went to VPN connections>Configure VPN
2011-07-02T20:24:00.000Z	yeats	morth	okay - good - that's called "Network Manager"
2011-07-02T20:25:00.000Z	yeats	morth	go to VPN Connections > Configure VPN, then click on the IPv4 tab
2011-07-02T20:25:00.000Z	morth	yeats	will this allow me to use my VPN on irssi?
2011-07-02T20:25:00.000Z	yeats	morth	then select Automatic (VPN) addresses only
2011-07-02T20:25:00.000Z	yeats	morth	hopefully
2011-07-02T20:26:00.000Z	yeats	morth	what's probably happening is that Ubuntu is routing all internet traffic through your VPN connection (which may be blocking irssi)
2011-07-02T20:26:00.000Z	morth	yeats	okay, after automatic vpn, address only now what
2011-07-02T20:27:00.000Z	yeats	morth	click Save and try again ;-)
2011-07-02T20:27:00.000Z	morth	yeats	okay brb in a few
2011-07-02T20:29:00.000Z	yeats	morth	I'm leaving in a sec, but keep asking in the channel so others can help
2011-07-02T20:29:00.000Z	morth	yeats	i got " Irssi: Unable to connect server irc.freenode.net port 6667 [Name or service not known]" when i try to connect
2011-07-02T20:32:00.000Z	yeats	morth	is the VPN your only means of connecting to the Internet?
2011-07-02T20:43:00.000Z	morth	yeats	i still can't seem to get it working, i just tried irssi -c irc.freenode.net -p 6667 and it just sat there saying connecting forever.
