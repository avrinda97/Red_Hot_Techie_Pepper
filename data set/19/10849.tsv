2006-11-09T15:41:00.000Z	salim		ok I'll never use it again, but what can I do now?
2006-11-09T15:43:00.000Z	salim		but I can mount my ubuntu partitions, but why can't I boot into it?
2006-11-09T15:43:00.000Z	salim		it just stops showing the ubuntu splash with a few lines in the status bar
2006-11-09T15:43:00.000Z	salim		i am in ubuntu live cd right now
2006-11-09T15:45:00.000Z	salim		if I just boot with windows cd, will it destroy my linux partitions?
2006-11-09T15:45:00.000Z	salim		and if I repair?
2006-11-09T15:47:00.000Z	salim		does ubuntu has a repair option?
2006-11-09T15:48:00.000Z	salim		SuSE is great, it has a cool repair system, if you destroy your linux...
2006-11-09T15:49:00.000Z	salim		I'm now in ubuntu LiveCD, does ubuntu has an option, where it tries to repair my system? like repair-install??
2006-11-09T15:51:00.000Z	salim		I'm on livecd because ubuntu stuck in last boot-process, does it has a log file anywhere, so I can at least see why and where he stopped?
2006-11-09T15:52:00.000Z	mc44	salim	if you can access the drive with ubuntu on, the relevant logs should be in /var/log
2006-11-09T15:53:00.000Z	mc44	salim	well kern.log may be a good start
2006-11-09T15:54:00.000Z	mc44	salim	or syslog
2006-11-09T15:55:00.000Z	mc44	salim	syslog or kern.log?
2006-11-09T15:56:00.000Z	mc44	salim	and where is the boot failing?
2006-11-09T15:56:00.000Z	mc44	salim	yes, but what is the problem with booting?
2006-11-09T15:58:00.000Z	mc44	salim	do you get a bootloader menu to chose what to boot into?
2006-11-09T15:59:00.000Z	mc44	salim	have you tried rcovey mode opton?
2006-11-09T16:00:00.000Z	mc44	salim	in the list there should be two ubuntu options, one which says recovery mode?
