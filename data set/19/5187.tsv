2008-08-16T01:28:00.000Z	desertmax	Fredd	What is your Ubuntu version?
2008-08-16T01:29:00.000Z	Fredd	desertmax	i tried both on hardy and intrepid
2008-08-16T01:32:00.000Z	Fredd	desertmax	im pretty sure its not
2008-08-16T02:12:00.000Z	desertmax	Fredd	this is not the way to go, I think.
2008-08-16T02:12:00.000Z	desertmax	Fredd	Connect the device to your PC, then right-click it and click on properties.
2008-08-16T02:13:00.000Z	Fredd	desertmax	that doesnt work
2008-08-16T02:14:00.000Z	desertmax	Fredd	go to the Volume-tab. Enter the name you want to give the device into the mount-point entry (e.g. files)
2008-08-16T02:17:00.000Z	desertmax	Fredd	Did you reconnect the device already?
2008-08-16T02:25:00.000Z	desertmax	Fredd	just the name (e.g. files), not the whole path (e.g. /media/files)
2008-08-16T02:26:00.000Z	desertmax	Fredd	yes, I am sure.
2008-08-16T02:27:00.000Z	desertmax	Fredd	btw, the information is stored in gconf (System, storage, volumes). If you ever mess something up, like using /media/files as mount-point, you may open gconf-editor and go there to fix any errors.
2008-08-16T02:27:00.000Z	desertmax	Fredd	and remount the device, so the changes can take effect. :-)
2008-08-16T02:28:00.000Z	desertmax	Fredd	Go to system, storage, volumes
2008-08-16T02:29:00.000Z	desertmax	Fredd	then to _org_... and change the mount-point option to files.
2008-08-16T02:30:00.000Z	Fredd	desertmax	i went "mount /dev/sdb1" but now its mounted back to the same place /media/My Files
2008-08-16T02:31:00.000Z	Fredd	desertmax	or do i need to restart the machine?
2008-08-16T02:32:00.000Z	desertmax	Fredd	Could you check the "Volume"-Tab again?
2008-08-16T02:32:00.000Z	Fredd	desertmax	yeah the mount point is "files"
2008-08-16T02:33:00.000Z	desertmax	Fredd	That's odd, I did the same thing and it worked for me.
