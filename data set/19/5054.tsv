2009-08-17T05:31:00.000Z	Checkmate91		Using Hardy and Evolution does not have a spell check dictionary loaded.  What package am I missing?
2009-08-17T05:32:00.000Z	danc3	Checkmate91	maybe 'aspell' ?
2009-08-17T05:33:00.000Z	Checkmate91	danc3	I am missing that one
2009-08-17T05:33:00.000Z	danc3	Checkmate91	well..............
2009-08-17T05:34:00.000Z	Checkmate91	danc3	Installing now...
2009-08-17T05:35:00.000Z	Checkmate91	danc3	Still does not show on the list of spell checkers from within Evolution
2009-08-17T05:35:00.000Z	danc3	Checkmate91	I dunno then.  I suggest using Thunderbird for email, it's better anyway.
2009-08-17T05:36:00.000Z	Checkmate91	danc3	tried than many times and always come back to evo
2009-08-17T05:36:00.000Z	danc3	Checkmate91	<shrug>
2009-08-17T05:39:00.000Z	Checkmate91	danc3	my whole openoffice is not spell checking all of a sudden
2009-08-17T05:40:00.000Z	danc3	Checkmate91	I have no idea
2009-08-17T05:40:00.000Z	danc3	Checkmate91	do you *really* need a spell checker?
2009-08-17T05:41:00.000Z	Checkmate91	danc3	what kind of question is that....why not ask, do you really "need" a computer?
2009-08-17T05:41:00.000Z	danc3	Checkmate91	it's a valid question.  Can you not spell without a spell-checker?
2009-08-17T05:42:00.000Z	Checkmate91	danc3	I can compute without a computer.  have you uninstalled your spell checker?
2009-08-17T05:43:00.000Z	danc3	Checkmate91	yes, no spell checkers installed here.
2009-08-17T05:43:00.000Z	Checkmate91	danc3	doubtful but I would think this is a reasonable request as Stormx2 has also indicated
2009-08-17T05:43:00.000Z	danc3	Checkmate91	if you say so.  I don't need one myself.  <shrug>
2009-08-17T05:48:00.000Z	Checkmate91	danc3	the answer to my question is.... myspell
