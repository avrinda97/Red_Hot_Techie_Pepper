2010-11-05T10:44:00.000Z	ramas		blue1: Im back did what the article told me to disable ipv6, is disabled: cat /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/all/disable_ipv6  = 1 yet the issue remains
2010-11-05T10:45:00.000Z	ramas		blue1: very annoying actually I could live with the slow connection to start because when connection is done it works fine, just being unable to work in channel or watch livestream is cripping and very damaging for me
2010-11-05T10:47:00.000Z	ramas		anymore ideas?
2010-11-05T10:49:00.000Z	ramas		can anyone else be kind enough of lending me a hand? please let me know
2010-11-05T10:49:00.000Z	vgold	ramas	can you talk now?
2010-11-05T10:50:00.000Z	ramas	vgold	Issue with a vostro v13 and weird annoying disconnections while using livestream media, seem to be related to ipv6 or something although I have disabled it from several howtos
2010-11-05T10:50:00.000Z	ramas	vgold	running lucid, but it started happening on karmic, vostro came preloaded with jaunty in it didnt have any issues
2010-11-05T10:52:00.000Z	ramas	vgold	on livestream no error, thats what has made it really difficult to fix, it just says disconnected in the chats, the streams, NEVER start and in the webcaster or livestudio app in flash I never pass from the authenticating please wait message
2010-11-05T10:53:00.000Z	ramas	vgold	I think is related to the fact that if I open a ssh, ftp or other service connection it takes some 22 secs to open the connection, from there it works fine no issues
2010-11-05T10:53:00.000Z	ramas	vgold	my system is up 2 date u want me to try anyway?
2010-11-05T10:54:00.000Z	ramas	vgold	just did it fetched all in 11secs ... Reading package lists... done
2010-11-05T10:56:00.000Z	ramas	vgold	I could live with this, all else works flawlessly is just that due to my job we opened a livestream account and Is irritating to be unable to admin or see the streams from my main laptop
2010-11-05T10:57:00.000Z	ramas	vgold	any more ideas? when the lap is freshly installed I had to disable.ipv6 resolution on firefox because it was taking eons for each link, chrome didnt need anything but both exhinbit the livestream issue, dont know if it is related
2010-11-05T10:59:00.000Z	ramas	vgold	dont have a yahoo messenger account, I have msn, google and skype any work for you?
2010-11-05T11:03:00.000Z	ramas	vgold	Ok I just lost that one, can u send it again?
2010-11-05T11:05:00.000Z	ramas	vgold	I added you  but it said nothing, annoying thing I liked pidgin better
2010-11-05T11:08:00.000Z	ramas	vgold	Ull have to excuse me but I dont get if u ask me to msg u directly from empathy or through a Dmessage here, I have only used irc chat 2 or 3 times so not very familiar with the commands
