2007-04-25T10:45:00.000Z	jacquesmerde		hey, i installed epiphany and noticed that the default search engine is the BRITISH google, even though ubuntu knows i live in australia. has this happened to anyone else?
2007-04-25T10:46:00.000Z	thebillywayne	jacquesmerde	that sort of thing has happened to me before.
2007-04-25T10:46:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	thebillywayne	its a bug with the epiphany package, yeah? rather than a bug in the ubuntu location settigns..
2007-04-25T10:47:00.000Z	thebillywayne	jacquesmerde	yeah.  my Open Office was giving me everything in Greek.  It's minor package bug, nothing serious.
2007-04-25T10:48:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	thebillywayne	how do i fix the epiphany problem?
2007-04-25T10:49:00.000Z	thebillywayne	jacquesmerde	let me play around with Epiphany for a second.
2007-04-25T10:54:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	thebillywayne	actually, its obvious how to fix it. ideally i'd like to delete it, but then which smart bookmark does epiphany use as default
2007-04-25T10:55:00.000Z	thebillywayne	jacquesmerde	can't you just set a new one?
2007-04-25T10:56:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	thebillywayne	if you just chuck some search terms into the location bar, it searches using "Search the web", but i'm wondering if you delete that bookmark, how it picks the "default" one to search with in that condition
2007-04-25T10:59:00.000Z	thebillywayne	jacquesmerde	i see what you mean.  mine defaults to the us google site.
2007-04-25T11:00:00.000Z	thebillywayne	jacquesmerde	i think I may have an answer.  Go to "Edit Bookmarks"
2007-04-25T11:00:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	thebillywayne	done!
2007-04-25T11:01:00.000Z	thebillywayne	jacquesmerde	is "search the web" under uncategorized?
2007-04-25T11:02:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	thebillywayne	yeah. all my smartbookmarks are
2007-04-25T11:03:00.000Z	thebillywayne	jacquesmerde	right click on "search the web" and select properties.  you can change the address from there.  hope that works.
2007-04-25T11:05:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	thebillywayne	yeah, i knew that already
2007-04-25T11:07:00.000Z	thebillywayne	jacquesmerde	sorry that didn't work.  not sure how to go about that.  If I were you, I'd simply make a new bookmark out of www.google.com.au
2007-04-25T11:08:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	thebillywayne	i can do that, i'm just wondering how to make that bookmark the default one instead of the british one
2007-04-25T11:09:00.000Z	thebillywayne	jacquesmerde	yeah, that's an issue.  not sure how to change that.  firefox a bit heavy on your system?
