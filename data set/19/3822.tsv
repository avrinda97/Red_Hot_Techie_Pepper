2012-05-11T16:06:00.000Z	Dr_willis	parapan	 so use the pae kernel. :)
2012-05-11T16:06:00.000Z	parapan	Dr_willis	linuxfreaker: you're the man ....thanks
2012-05-11T16:06:00.000Z	Dr_willis	parapan	 pae is default on 12.04
2012-05-11T16:06:00.000Z	Dr_willis	parapan	 pae is default on 12.04 32bit install - i mean. :)
2012-05-11T16:07:00.000Z	parapan	Dr_willis	that's why trying to upgrade but .....it seems a little bit risky this way
2012-05-11T16:07:00.000Z	Dr_willis		but with exactly 4gb of ram.. you are still at the non-pae limit.
2012-05-11T16:07:00.000Z	Dr_willis		now with more then 4gb.. pae would help..
2012-05-11T16:07:00.000Z	parapan	Dr_willis	yes but 10.04 is only seeing 3 Gb from my total 4
2012-05-11T16:08:00.000Z	Dr_willis	parapan	 with 4gb of ram. some is still reserved by the various hardware devices for various reasons. may be why you are not seeing more.
2012-05-11T16:08:00.000Z	Dr_willis	parapan	 the pae kernel does exist in 10.04.
2012-05-11T16:09:00.000Z	parapan	Dr_willis	grrrr I'll check that link and see
2012-05-11T16:11:00.000Z	parapan	Dr_willis	truth is in the middle as usual ...if at installation time you have 4 Gb then the pae support is installed; if not, one will have to enable-it at a later time :d
2012-05-11T16:11:00.000Z	Dr_willis	parapan	 for 12.04 from what i read - the 32bit live cd - defaults to using the 32bit pae kernel. which can cause issues on older hardware.
2012-05-11T16:12:00.000Z	Dr_willis	parapan	 but i alwyas use 64bit os. :) so i never worry about it
2012-05-11T16:15:00.000Z	parapan	Dr_willis	lucky you ...one question more ....you do need to have the GPU with 64 bit capabilities ...is this correct ??? you cannot use 64 bit OS on non 64 bits GPU correct ?
2012-05-11T16:16:00.000Z	Dr_willis	parapan	 32bit hardware cant run 64bit os.
2012-05-11T16:16:00.000Z	Dr_willis	parapan	 32bit CPU  cant run 64bit os ;)  GPU is  the video card
2012-05-11T16:16:00.000Z	parapan	Dr_willis	so I've got that right
2012-05-11T16:16:00.000Z	parapan	Dr_willis	correct ..CPU ...mistyped
