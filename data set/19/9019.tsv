2007-01-05T08:32:00.000Z	funkdollar		bobby i used to run this on edgy a day ago with the open source radeon driver
2007-01-05T08:33:00.000Z	funkdollar		Well i am really shocked at the slowness of gnome redrawing my desktop with icons on it
2007-01-05T08:33:00.000Z	FurryNemesis	funkdollar	what does free -m give you?
2007-01-05T08:35:00.000Z	funkdollar	FurryNemesis	1011        330        680          0         22        189
2007-01-05T08:37:00.000Z	FurryNemesis	funkdollar	hmm, everytime you hit f5 it just chugs?
2007-01-05T08:38:00.000Z	funkdollar	FurryNemesis	its weird: if i do hard redraw thing on the desktop like moving windows around fast then reverting immediately to an empty desktop make the desktop icon redrawing choke
2007-01-05T08:40:00.000Z	FurryNemesis	funkdollar	recent problem? Updated anything recently?
2007-01-05T08:41:00.000Z	funkdollar	FurryNemesis	i have a clean edgy install - well i had beryl and uninstalled it and also played with the gcong setting regarding metacity performance features.
2007-01-05T08:42:00.000Z	FurryNemesis	funkdollar	that probably did it
2007-01-05T08:42:00.000Z	FurryNemesis	funkdollar	got a backup?
2007-01-05T08:42:00.000Z	funkdollar	FurryNemesis	well a backup is out of the question i am afraid
2007-01-05T08:43:00.000Z	FurryNemesis	funkdollar	how about getting a clean gcong off your install cd?
2007-01-05T08:44:00.000Z	funkdollar	FurryNemesis	how could that be done ?
2007-01-05T08:45:00.000Z	FurryNemesis	funkdollar	er..... I assume there's a gcong.conf file somewhere in the .metacity folder if you can access that - it should be clean
2007-01-05T08:45:00.000Z	FurryNemesis	funkdollar	but that's a pure guess
2007-01-05T08:45:00.000Z	funkdollar	FurryNemesis	i have been told many times never to mess with a working linux box :-)
2007-01-05T08:46:00.000Z	FurryNemesis	funkdollar	rubbish, if it's not broken, tweak it
2007-01-05T08:47:00.000Z	funkdollar	FurryNemesis	that was definately not my opinion ! Any other alternatives for icon placement ? I see many docks in screenshots like mac osx dock
2007-01-05T08:48:00.000Z	FurryNemesis	funkdollar	sorry, I don't use docks. Check the repos?
