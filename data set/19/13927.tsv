2004-12-12T14:21:00.000Z	robert_		hello ;) I wonder if there is possible to convert ubuntu to debian by edit the /etc/apt/sources.list with debian unstable mirrors ?
2004-12-12T14:21:00.000Z	crimsun	robert_	"reverting" to Sid?
2004-12-12T14:22:00.000Z	robert_	crimsun	hmm.. yeah ?!
2004-12-12T14:22:00.000Z	crimsun	robert_	and are you starting from warty or hoary?
2004-12-12T14:22:00.000Z	crimsun	robert_	warty->sid is doable
2004-12-12T14:22:00.000Z	crimsun	robert_	hoary->sid is a lot more painful
2004-12-12T14:23:00.000Z	robert_	crimsun	okey,. ..
2004-12-12T14:23:00.000Z	robert_	crimsun	brb, i'm at work .. ;)
2004-12-12T14:24:00.000Z	robert_	crimsun	if i add debian unstable in sources.list and do a apt-get dist-upgrade, will this work ?
2004-12-12T14:25:00.000Z	crimsun	robert_	if you only add sid lines without removing warty{-security} lines, you may encounter problems.
2004-12-12T14:25:00.000Z	crimsun	robert_	and of course you need to `sudo apt-get update' first
2004-12-12T14:25:00.000Z	robert_	crimsun	okey, nice to know
2007-05-02T12:02:00.000Z	crimsun	robert_	hera.kernel.org/git/  (search for ubuntu-*.git.)
2007-05-02T12:05:00.000Z	robert_	crimsun	my friend wants to know if she can patch a ubuntu kernel, or if there will be problems
2007-05-02T12:05:00.000Z	crimsun	robert_	it may be difficult.  What does she want to patch in?
2007-05-02T12:08:00.000Z	robert_	crimsun	she runs a stock kernel
2007-05-02T12:08:00.000Z	crimsun	robert_	a stock .21 doesn't have all our wifi and sound patches, among many others.
2007-05-02T12:09:00.000Z	robert_	crimsun	will it *break* is what she wants to know- i.e. not boot
2007-05-02T12:09:00.000Z	crimsun	robert_	I need hardware details.  Unless you want me to guess what hardware she has.
