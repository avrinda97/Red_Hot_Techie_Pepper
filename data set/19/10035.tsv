2007-10-18T15:53:00.000Z	Myrtti		it's not final until official announcment, please join #ubuntu-release-party for more information.
2007-10-18T15:55:00.000Z	Myrtti		and I'm starting to lack my sense of humor rapidly
2007-10-18T15:55:00.000Z	Myrtti		/me waves her magic 8 ball and shows the result to esperegu
2007-10-18T15:55:00.000Z	esperegu	Myrtti	which result?
2007-10-18T15:56:00.000Z	Myrtti	esperegu	you tell me, was it undecisive?
2007-10-18T15:57:00.000Z	esperegu	Myrtti	I am not following you. I am just currious about the schedule for updating via the update manager... since the new version is out now but is not yet appearing in my updates.
2007-10-18T15:57:00.000Z	Myrtti	esperegu	"we don't know"
2007-10-18T15:57:00.000Z	esperegu	Myrtti	so there is no known policy for that?
2007-10-18T15:58:00.000Z	Myrtti	esperegu	my guess is that the update comes available simultaneously with the release team announcing the isos are out
2007-10-18T15:59:00.000Z	esperegu	Myrtti	but I already downloaded the ISO.
2007-10-18T15:59:00.000Z	Myrtti	esperegu	then when the final release announcment comes, check the MD5 checksums
2007-10-18T15:59:00.000Z	Myrtti	esperegu	might be same, might not
2007-10-18T16:00:00.000Z	Myrtti	esperegu	that's why we're discouraging people from spreading the download urls
2007-10-18T16:00:00.000Z	esperegu	Myrtti	that was called rc as far as I know.
2007-10-18T16:00:00.000Z	esperegu	Myrtti	kubuntu-7.10-desktop-i386.iso            16-Oct-2007 23:28  697M  Desktop CD for PC (Intel x86) computers (standard download)
2007-10-18T16:00:00.000Z	Myrtti	esperegu	please join #ubuntu-release-party if you can
2007-10-18T16:01:00.000Z	esperegu	Myrtti	done
2007-10-18T16:01:00.000Z	Myrtti	esperegu	there it is explained
