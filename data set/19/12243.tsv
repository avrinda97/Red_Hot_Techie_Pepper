2005-09-30T08:35:00.000Z	Hfuy		Under Windows I have a dynamic DNS updater which works rather well.
2005-09-30T08:35:00.000Z	Hfuy		Yes.
2005-09-30T08:35:00.000Z	Hfuy		I presume there's equivalents for Linux
2005-09-30T08:35:00.000Z	Hfuy		That way you can have a standard hostname (usually whatever.dyndns.org) and it works reliably.
2005-09-30T08:37:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	Hfuy	there is one module for dydns in webmin
2005-09-30T08:37:00.000Z	wickedpuppy		more than one actually
2005-09-30T08:38:00.000Z	Hfuy	wickedpuppy	I presumed something similar.
2005-09-30T08:38:00.000Z	wickedpuppy		and dyndns itself provides scripts
2005-09-30T08:38:00.000Z	wickedpuppy		i used them before
2005-09-30T08:38:00.000Z	Hfuy		The Windows one I use is called DNSser
2005-09-30T08:38:00.000Z	wickedpuppy		some works ... some doesn't
2005-09-30T08:38:00.000Z	Hfuy		Works fine
2005-09-30T08:38:00.000Z	Hfuy		It's hardly rocket science. You could probably write it as a shell script.
2005-09-30T08:38:00.000Z	wickedpuppy		well yah .. so why not you write one ?
2005-09-30T08:39:00.000Z	Hfuy		I'm under Windows.
2005-09-30T08:39:00.000Z	Hfuy		But yes.
2005-09-30T08:39:00.000Z	Hfuy		All it usually does is requests the status page from the router every so often, greps out the IP, compares it with last time, and requests a URL at dyndns.org if it's different.
2005-09-30T08:39:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	Hfuy	if you are under windows ... why you need to ask  ?? i am curious
2005-09-30T08:40:00.000Z	Hfuy	wickedpuppy	I wasn't asking, somneone else was.
