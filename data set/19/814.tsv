2011-10-15T01:56:00.000Z	olmari		hello
2011-10-15T01:57:00.000Z	olmari		I think in 11.10 (server) /etc/network/interfaces is somehwo flaved... or infra around it
2011-10-15T01:57:00.000Z	olmari		I define eth1 and eth1:1 and only one of them gets really "be there"
2011-10-15T01:57:00.000Z	olmari		ifconfig shows only one of them
2011-10-15T01:57:00.000Z	olmari		no both
2011-10-15T01:58:00.000Z	olmari		but still if I command "ifup eth1:1" it says "already configured"
2011-10-15T01:59:00.000Z	HeGuru	olmari	why do you need eth1:1? If you need to add additional IP try "ip addr add " as that the now preferred method
2011-10-15T01:59:00.000Z	olmari	HeGuru	for Tvix and ultimately for diffirent MTU for it...
2011-10-15T01:59:00.000Z	olmari	HeGuru	but it's _broken_... it has been working until now
2011-10-15T02:00:00.000Z	olmari	HeGuru	there is even gazillion tutorials to do stuff just like that
2011-10-15T02:01:00.000Z	olmari	HeGuru	and even if "ip darr add", to where I specify it? to get it be at boot
2011-10-15T02:01:00.000Z	HeGuru	olmari	you can add it to /etc/network/interfaces in the main interface using "up ip addr add ..."
2011-10-15T02:02:00.000Z	olmari	HeGuru	mm well... I can try that
2011-10-15T02:19:00.000Z	olmari	HeGuru	hmm... I think it is even done as is !
2011-10-15T02:19:00.000Z	olmari	HeGuru	ip route shows it, while ifconfig doesn't
2011-10-15T02:20:00.000Z	olmari	HeGuru	I mean by setting it in /e/n/interfaces
2011-10-15T02:21:00.000Z	olmari	HeGuru	I'd only then hope someday this method would show alias IP on ifconfig too somewhere .. :/
2011-10-15T02:21:00.000Z	HeGuru	olmari	ip addr should show you all IPs
2011-10-15T02:21:00.000Z	olmari	HeGuru	sure it does... but it's not the same...
