2008-02-18T10:11:00.000Z	saxofoner		so I've got my virtualbox all set up with my windows partition to run inside of ubuntu, but I get a hard disk error.  It doesn't even make it to the "choose hardware profile" menu  I know it has something to do with SCSI and SATA, but that's all I know.
2008-02-18T10:13:00.000Z	xyblor	saxofoner	how do you get virtualbox to boot a hard disk rather than an image file?
2008-02-18T10:13:00.000Z	saxofoner	xyblor	I'll get you a link, hang on
2008-02-18T10:13:00.000Z	xyblor	saxofoner	thanks

2008-02-18T10:15:00.000Z	xyblor	saxofoner	great, maybe now I can boot my virus-infested XP from Ubuntu ;-)
2008-02-18T10:15:00.000Z	saxofoner		YAY
2008-02-18T10:15:00.000Z	saxofoner		I read about some guy running all these viruses in wine, he lost his whole partition
2008-02-18T10:15:00.000Z	xyblor	saxofoner	yikes, maybe I shouldn't do it then
2008-02-18T10:16:00.000Z	xyblor	saxofoner	I wonder how you get viruses in Wine?
2008-02-18T10:16:00.000Z	saxofoner		run them yourself
2008-02-18T10:17:00.000Z	saxofoner		they shouldn't spread unless you try to cultivate them or something... with moisture and heat
2008-02-18T10:18:00.000Z	xyblor	saxofoner	I thought viruses depended on flaws in memory usage and network security in Windows. Those vulnerabilities wouldn't be present if you're running wine apps through linux, right?
2008-02-18T10:18:00.000Z	saxofoner		it could effect the virtual drive_c I think
2008-02-18T10:19:00.000Z	saxofoner		not your actual OS
2008-02-18T10:19:00.000Z	xyblor		but linux is still in control of networking and memory usage with Wine
2008-02-18T10:20:00.000Z	xyblor		unless you deliberately run a virus executable with wine...
2008-02-18T10:20:00.000Z	saxofoner		Wine is SO awesome it can get viruses.  Just leave it at that.  ;)
2008-02-18T10:20:00.000Z	xyblor	saxofoner	yeah, you get an authentic windows experience with wine
