2005-11-25T12:14:00.000Z	Xenguy	trappist	is it possible to get TS for W2K (it's not installed right now AFAICT)
2005-11-25T12:14:00.000Z	trappist	Xenguy	yes, but it's not free
2005-11-25T12:15:00.000Z	Xenguy	trappist	ahh
2005-11-29T17:31:00.000Z	Xenguy	trappist	pgrep is cool - never heard of that before
2005-11-29T17:32:00.000Z	Xenguy	trappist	used to doing ps aux
2005-11-29T17:32:00.000Z	Xenguy	trappist	pkill seems to work more consistently than killall I've found recently too
2006-01-01T13:46:00.000Z	trappist	Xenguy	I use nvidia's drivers, but the debs are supposed to be fine
2006-01-01T13:47:00.000Z	Xenguy	trappist	did you follow the 'BinaryDriverHowto' on the wiki?
2006-01-01T13:47:00.000Z	trappist	Xenguy	no, I've been using nvidia drivers for a long time, so I just did it the way I've always done it.
2006-01-01T13:48:00.000Z	Xenguy	trappist	can you tell me how you did it, or give hints/pointers?
2006-01-01T13:49:00.000Z	trappist	Xenguy	I installed the kernel headers (sudo apt-get install linux-headers-`uname -r`), downloaded the drivers from nvidia's site, and said sudo sh NVIDIA*
2006-01-01T13:51:00.000Z	Xenguy	trappist	OK, so you installed the official nvidia drivers, not the DEBs
2006-01-01T13:52:00.000Z	trappist	Xenguy	yes
2006-01-01T13:52:00.000Z	Xenguy	trappist	alright, I'll have a look at that option then - tx
2006-01-01T13:52:00.000Z	trappist	Xenguy	it's easier to use the debs, though.
2006-01-01T13:53:00.000Z	Xenguy	trappist	I'm sure it is, but those are not working for me, as I mentioned
2006-01-21T10:36:00.000Z	trappist	Xenguy	stfu.
2006-01-21T10:36:00.000Z	Xenguy	trappist	oh my
