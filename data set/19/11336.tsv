2006-03-11T17:22:00.000Z	DJ_tobias		would anybody know why when i disable my onboard video and plugin my nvidia pci card my wireless connection just WONT connect ?
2006-03-11T17:22:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	DJ_tobias	disabling onboard video = BIOS settings, not OS issue
2006-03-11T17:23:00.000Z	DJ_tobias	hatake_kakashi	i know that but.. why is it that when my pci card is in, ndiswrapper/wlan0 wont connect ?
2006-03-11T17:24:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	DJ_tobias	it could be shared IRQ, check motherboard manual + lspci
2006-03-11T17:26:00.000Z	DJ_tobias	hatake_kakashi	in lspci it doesnt look like a shared irq
2006-03-11T17:26:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	DJ_tobias	it won't show up if its a shared IRQ conflict, all it does is it shows what hardware has it detected on PCI slots
2006-03-11T17:27:00.000Z	DJ_tobias	hatake_kakashi	so if they both show up in lspci then thats not the problem?
2006-03-11T17:27:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	DJ_tobias	generally, yes
2006-03-11T17:27:00.000Z	DJ_tobias	hatake_kakashi	what else could be the problem?
2006-03-11T17:28:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	DJ_tobias	again, you may need to consult with the motherboard manual + those PCI cards that are conlicting manuals?
2006-03-11T17:28:00.000Z	DJ_tobias	hatake_kakashi	dont have the motherboard manual
2006-03-11T17:28:00.000Z	DJ_tobias	hatake_kakashi	if i put the card in a different pci slot would that help?
2006-03-11T17:29:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	DJ_tobias	possibly, you may be able to get your motherboard manual online, go look for your motherboard's manufacturer's website and they should provide you one unless if yours is really outdated
2006-03-11T17:30:00.000Z	DJ_tobias	hatake_kakashi	if i did get the manual, what would i be looking for?
2006-03-11T17:31:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	DJ_tobias	the motherboard manual will show you a table of which PCI IRQ slots are shared
2006-03-11T17:55:00.000Z	DJ_tobias	hatake_kakashi	that didnt help
2006-03-11T17:56:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	DJ_tobias	so you have tried a couple of different PCI slots and yet it still fails to detect?
2006-03-11T17:58:00.000Z	DJ_tobias	hatake_kakashi	i really have no clue whats going on :( when i use onboard video, i can use ndiswrapper/get online fine...but when i disable onboard video and put in my nvidia pci card.... cant connect
2006-03-11T17:59:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	DJ_tobias	what about the manual? you might want to try reading to see if you can find out which is shared. That problem is kinda odd, but because your video card is PCI, and so is your wireless card, its definetly an IRQ conflict
