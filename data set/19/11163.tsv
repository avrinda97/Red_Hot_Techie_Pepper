2006-05-20T16:50:00.000Z	callie		anyone here able to help me troubleshoot a hardware problem
2006-05-20T16:51:00.000Z	callie		i've installed some new ram and now my pc wont boot
2006-05-20T16:51:00.000Z	callie		i've followed the procedure described in the manuals to the letter
2006-05-20T16:51:00.000Z	callie		now im lost
2006-05-20T16:51:00.000Z	callie		and sad :(
2006-05-20T16:52:00.000Z	callie		yeah, tried that still the same
2006-05-20T16:52:00.000Z	callie		its weird
2006-05-20T16:52:00.000Z	callie		fans attempt to spin but dont
2006-05-20T16:53:00.000Z	DBO	callie	how comfortable are you inside a case?
2006-05-20T16:53:00.000Z	callie	DBO	im pretty confident, i've done a few self builds now
2006-05-20T16:54:00.000Z	DBO	callie	I would reseat the RAM for starters, if not I would reaseat the entire motherboard
2006-05-20T16:55:00.000Z	DBO	callie	if its grounded the result would be very similar to what you described
2006-05-20T16:55:00.000Z	callie	DBO	what should i look for to tell if its grounded ?
2006-05-20T16:56:00.000Z	DBO	callie	anything metal other than the standoffs touching the motherboard (like a loose screw) would do it
2006-05-20T16:57:00.000Z	DBO	callie	unplug all your drives, remove all your PCI cards (except video) and see if it boots then
2006-05-20T16:57:00.000Z	DBO	callie	if not take out all but one stick of RAM and try again
2006-05-20T16:57:00.000Z	DBO	callie	failing that, reseat (rebuilt) the entire system and try again
2006-05-20T16:57:00.000Z	DBO	callie	failing THAT you are facing hardware failure...
