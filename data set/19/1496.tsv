2011-01-12T07:46:00.000Z	ajwill		hi all, I need help, desparately, I have a computer and I'm currently dualbooting ubuntu and windows (10.10 and XP respectively) and I changed a few settings in grub, suddenly, it automatically boots my windows partition without even giving me the chance to select my ubuntu partition, how can I get into my ubuntu partition to change the settings back and run update-grub? (I have ubuntu rescue
2011-01-12T07:46:00.000Z	ajwill		remix 10.10 and knoppix on two pendrives if that helps)
2011-01-12T07:47:00.000Z	m1ndvirus	ajwill	Hold SHIFT on bootup.
2011-01-12T07:47:00.000Z	ajwill	m1ndvirus	tried that, didnt work :)
2011-01-12T07:47:00.000Z	m1ndvirus	ajwill	F2 over and over then,.
2011-01-12T07:48:00.000Z	ajwill	m1ndvirus	lol F2 is the boot menu
2011-01-12T07:48:00.000Z	ajwill	m1ndvirus	wait wrong thing, not boot menu, system setup
2011-01-12T07:48:00.000Z	m1ndvirus	ajwill	Depending on the BIOS, yes, but F2 was GRUB1's escape as well.
2011-01-12T07:49:00.000Z	ajwill	m1ndvirus	this is grub2 :)
2011-01-12T07:49:00.000Z	m1ndvirus	ajwill	Good luck then. I'm all out of ideas.
2011-01-12T07:50:00.000Z	m1ndvirus	ajwill	What could very well be is Windows overwrote your MBR.
2011-01-12T07:50:00.000Z	ajwill	m1ndvirus	no, I changed some settings and made it so it automatically boots windows, I meant to have a few seconds to load the grub menu to boot ubuntu but I forgot and rebooted, now I cant boot ubuntu to get to it
2011-01-12T07:51:00.000Z	m1ndvirus	ajwill	Use a LiveCD.
2011-01-12T07:51:00.000Z	ajwill	m1ndvirus	I toldja I have ubuntu rescue remix 10.10
2011-01-12T07:51:00.000Z	m1ndvirus	ajwill	Did not see that.
2011-01-12T07:51:00.000Z	m1ndvirus	ajwill	Boot off of that, fuck with shit in /etc/default/grub and /etc/grub.d/*
2011-01-12T07:52:00.000Z	ajwill	m1ndvirus	I can boot the rescue remix, and edit the file, but I need to be able to run update-grub
2011-01-12T07:52:00.000Z	m1ndvirus	ajwill	So chroot.
2011-01-12T08:02:00.000Z	ajwill	m1ndvirus	still not working, I tried running update-grub after chrooting into my ubuntu pc and it says cannot find a device for /(is /dev mounted?).
