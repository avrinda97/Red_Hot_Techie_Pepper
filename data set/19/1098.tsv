2011-05-09T21:26:00.000Z	kamcio2603_		and that leads me to my current problem..
2011-05-09T21:26:00.000Z	kamcio2603_		I installed Ubuntu but it just throws me into a debian console.
2011-05-09T21:26:00.000Z	kamcio2603_		so what do i do now?
2011-05-09T21:26:00.000Z	kamcio2603_		no it was a facebook one
2011-05-09T21:26:00.000Z	kamcio2603_		you know like those mal apps?
2011-05-09T21:26:00.000Z	kamcio2603_		yea
2011-05-09T21:26:00.000Z	kamcio2603_		very malicious
2011-05-09T21:26:00.000Z	kamcio2603_		and dangerous
2011-05-09T21:27:00.000Z	kamcio2603_		i think it's one of the newer threats
2011-05-09T21:27:00.000Z	kamcio2603_		either way it probably wouldn't affect me if i had something like windows 7

2011-05-09T21:29:00.000Z	kamcio2603_		this is on topic
2011-05-09T21:29:00.000Z	kamcio2603_	oCean	if you have a problem with it why don't you answer my initial question rather than be a jerk?
2011-05-09T21:29:00.000Z	kamcio2603_		okay?
2011-05-09T21:29:00.000Z	kamcio2603_	oCean	is a jerk off
2011-05-09T21:29:00.000Z	oCean	kamcio2603_	that attitude is not really going to help
2011-05-09T21:29:00.000Z	kamcio2603_	oCean	what are you going to do about it?
2011-05-09T21:30:00.000Z	kamcio2603_	oCean	my piss stream is stronger than anything you can throw at me, bring it
