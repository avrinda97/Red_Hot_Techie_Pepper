2011-07-17T14:22:00.000Z	glebihan	weizhao	I think you need to install the "libgtk2.0-dev" package
2011-07-17T14:24:00.000Z	weizhao	glebihan	okey, try it.
2011-07-17T14:32:00.000Z	weizhao		error: Header file pcap.h not found; if you installed libpcap
2011-07-17T14:32:00.000Z	weizhao		from source, did you also do "make install-incl", and if you installed a
2011-07-17T14:32:00.000Z	weizhao		binary package of libpcap, is there also a developer's package of libpcap,
2011-07-17T14:32:00.000Z	weizhao		and did you also install that package?
2011-07-17T14:32:00.000Z	weizhao		anyone one help~~
2011-07-17T14:33:00.000Z	glebihan	weizhao	did you try installing the "libpcap-dev" package ?
2011-07-17T14:34:00.000Z	weizhao	glebihan	sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev
2011-07-17T14:35:00.000Z	weizhao		i want to install wireshark
2011-07-17T14:35:00.000Z	weizhao	glebihan	i want to install wireshark
2011-07-17T14:35:00.000Z	glebihan	weizhao	not "libgtk2.0-dev" but "libpcap-dev"
2011-07-17T14:36:00.000Z	glebihan	weizhao	why did't you simply install the version from the repositories, ie "sudo apt-get install wireshark" ?
2011-07-17T14:38:00.000Z	weizhao	glebihan	... i downloaded the source before,so...
2011-07-17T14:38:00.000Z	glebihan	weizhao	should still be easier to install from repos...
2011-07-17T14:40:00.000Z	weizhao	glebihan	ha, libpcap-dev worked, wireshark has installed, thanks. :)
2011-07-17T14:40:00.000Z	glebihan	weizhao	you're welcome
