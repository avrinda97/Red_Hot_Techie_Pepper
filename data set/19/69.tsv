2012-10-19T02:33:00.000Z	Blackphyr		I updated from 12.04 to 12.10 today and now have no dash, and no bar across the top of my desktop. only the desktop icons I had before
2012-10-19T02:33:00.000Z	Blackphyr		anyone have an idea how to get my dash back?
2012-10-19T02:34:00.000Z	Blackphyr		Blackphyr> I did before. but I'm not sure how I can re-install it since I can't get to the settings / drivers
2012-10-19T02:35:00.000Z	Blackphyr		before I was able to install my graphics driver by going to 'additional drivers' in settings
2012-10-19T02:36:00.000Z	kroson_	Blackphyr	now that feature is in the Software Sources application, in a tab
2012-10-19T02:37:00.000Z	kroson_	Blackphyr	which one?
2012-10-19T02:38:00.000Z	kroson_	Blackphyr	but we need to know your card. On a terminal write 'lspci |grep AMD' the paste the output here
2012-10-19T02:40:00.000Z	kroson_	Blackphyr	you don't, do as i said :)
2012-10-19T02:47:00.000Z	kroson_	Blackphyr	lspci |grep ATI
2012-10-19T02:49:00.000Z	kroson_	Blackphyr	i can't remember what your issue was?
2012-10-19T02:50:00.000Z	Blackphyr	kroson_	I have no dash. nothing but desktop icons
2012-10-19T02:52:00.000Z	kroson_	Blackphyr	AMD dropped driver support for your card
2012-10-19T02:55:00.000Z	kroson_	Blackphyr	you could try amd legacy, but i don't know if it works, can't guarantee that :S
2012-10-19T02:57:00.000Z	Blackphyr	kroson_	how would I try that?
2012-10-19T03:04:00.000Z	kroson_	Blackphyr	log out, log in
2012-10-19T03:09:00.000Z	kroson_	Blackphyr	i don't know if you should... do you know how to revert to default in case you have any problem?
2012-10-19T03:14:00.000Z	kroson_	Blackphyr	lets try the ubuntu fglrx driver first, the one that is on the repositories
2012-10-19T03:15:00.000Z	kroson_	Blackphyr	are you in a terminal?
2012-10-19T03:16:00.000Z	kroson_	Blackphyr	lets backup xorg.conf
