2004-10-14T11:52:00.000Z	LinuxJones	jgeorgeson	I downloaded @ 600 kb/s using bittorrent 
2004-10-14T11:53:00.000Z	jgeorgeson	LinuxJones	bittorrent has never liked me very much, for some reason
2004-10-14T11:53:00.000Z	LinuxJones	jgeorgeson	it's all of the leeching. 50 people seeding and 500 downloading.

2004-10-15T06:02:00.000Z	LinuxJones	jgeorgeson	update-rc.d
2004-10-15T06:12:00.000Z	jgeorgeson	LinuxJones	`sudo update-rc.d postfix stop 20 3 4 5 .` just says 'System startup links for /etc/init.d/postfix already exist.'
2004-10-15T06:13:00.000Z	LinuxJones	jgeorgeson	if you want to stop a service you can /etc/init.d/servicename stop
2004-10-15T06:14:00.000Z	jgeorgeson	LinuxJones	I thought that command would make it not start in runlevels 345, which is what I want
2004-10-15T06:14:00.000Z	LinuxJones	jgeorgeson	if you want to delete the service from runlevels you can update-rc.d -f postfix remove
2004-10-15T06:16:00.000Z	jgeorgeson	LinuxJones	ah, k
2004-10-15T06:19:00.000Z	jgeorgeson	LinuxJones	I don't see a way to print a summary of each service's on/off setting for each runlevel
