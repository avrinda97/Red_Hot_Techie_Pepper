2011-10-22T18:58:00.000Z	bbbbbbbb		i have a problem with my dvd drive. when playing a dvd it stops spinning after a few mins, then start spinning again - during this the video doesnt play. this is extremely annoying when watching a movie. how do i solve this?
2011-10-22T19:00:00.000Z	BluesKaj	bbbbbbbb	just once per dvd or periodically during the movie?
2011-10-22T19:01:00.000Z	bbbbbbbb	BluesKaj	periodically during the movie, every few mins, at every dvd i play.
2011-10-22T19:01:00.000Z	BluesKaj	bbbbbbbb	ok , make sure you have ubuntu-restricted-extras installed
2011-10-22T19:03:00.000Z	BluesKaj	bbbbbbbb	usually it will install libdvdcss2 along with it , but check for that as well
2011-10-22T19:04:00.000Z	bbbbbbbb	BluesKaj	i will, thx. but the dvd or dvd files from the HDD play fine otherwise, only the drive behaves this weird
2011-10-22T19:06:00.000Z	BluesKaj	bbbbbbbb	the dvd DRM checks the region etc , but usually that's only once ...perhaps the drive is ovrheating and/or beginnining to fail ..it's hard to tell.
2011-10-22T19:08:00.000Z	bbbbbbbb	BluesKaj	it better not be beginning to fail, it's about two months old - now i have installed ubuntu-restricted-extras but it didn't change a thing. could it be the player i use (totem)?
2011-10-22T19:10:00.000Z	bbbbbbbb	BluesKaj	i always used vlc - but since i have my new laptop it has caused a few system freezes and stuff like this, so i stopped using it
2011-10-22T19:12:00.000Z	BluesKaj	bbbbbbbb	then maybe it isn't the player but the dvdrom if it exhibits similar symptoms on 2 software players
2011-10-22T19:14:00.000Z	bbbbbbbb	BluesKaj	now the dvd runs fine in vlc but the drive spins like crazy
2011-10-22T19:15:00.000Z	BluesKaj	bbbbbbbb	spins like crazy ? ...maybe it's the fan
2011-10-22T19:16:00.000Z	bbbbbbbb	BluesKaj	no, it's definitely the drive. i may try and look what it does when using windows later
2012-04-28T15:57:00.000Z	bbbbbbbb	BluesKaj	it's a laptop
2012-04-28T15:59:00.000Z	BluesKaj	bbbbbbbb	ok that's cool , I only use pulse because without it flash etc won't play any audio on websites
2012-04-28T16:00:00.000Z	bbbbbbbb	BluesKaj	because of your sound card? will flash etc still play audio when I uninstalled pulseaudio?
2012-04-28T16:00:00.000Z	BluesKaj	bbbbbbbb	yes I have a pci soundcard .
2012-04-28T16:01:00.000Z	bbbbbbbb	BluesKaj	would that affect my flash audio or anything if I remove pulse on my laptop?
2012-04-28T16:02:00.000Z	BluesKaj	bbbbbbbb	well you can try and if audio stops working you can always reinstall pulseaudio
