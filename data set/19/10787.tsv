2009-06-14T13:07:00.000Z	Untouchab1e		Been installing so many linux distros on my desktop now only to find that my problem exists on all of them..
2009-06-14T13:07:00.000Z	Untouchab1e		The internet connetion si dead slow, resulting in endless errors when updating or installing anything that involves an internet connection
2009-06-14T13:07:00.000Z	Untouchab1e		The internet connection works perfectly fine in Windows on the same computer..
2009-06-14T13:08:00.000Z	Untouchab1e		Anyone?
2009-06-14T13:09:00.000Z	Untouchab1e		Wired.. The computer is conneted to a 802.11n WLAN router through wire..
2009-06-14T13:10:00.000Z	Untouchab1e		802.11n or g og b is irrelevant since im connected with a cable..
2009-06-14T13:10:00.000Z	Untouchab1e		but yeah.. the router is connected directly to a laptop which shares its wireless internet connection
2009-06-14T13:11:00.000Z	Untouchab1e		and as mentioned, it works perfectly fine in Windows without problems..
2009-06-14T13:11:00.000Z	ikonia	Untouchab1e	working with windows has no relevance to ubuntu other than proving the hardware is working
2009-06-14T13:12:00.000Z	ikonia	Untouchab1e	what wirless network card is in your laptop/machine
2009-06-14T13:13:00.000Z	ikonia	Untouchab1e	check with lspci see what ubuntu recognises it as
2009-06-14T13:14:00.000Z	ikonia	Untouchab1e	ok, so your laptop is acting as a proxy/router
2009-06-14T13:15:00.000Z	ikonia	Untouchab1e	and your desktop is not able to connect, correct ?
2009-06-14T13:15:00.000Z	ikonia	Untouchab1e	ok, so what network card is in your desktop ?
2009-06-14T13:16:00.000Z	ikonia	Untouchab1e	if you do an "ifconfig -a" how many "ethX" devices do you see ?
2009-06-14T13:17:00.000Z	ikonia	Untouchab1e	on the desktop do an "lspci" and see what ubuntu identifies your networks as
2009-06-14T13:18:00.000Z	ikonia	Untouchab1e	if you're not using ubuntu - we can't help you
2009-06-14T13:18:00.000Z	ikonia	Untouchab1e	take it to #mandriva
2009-06-14T13:18:00.000Z	ikonia	Untouchab1e	that doesn't matter
