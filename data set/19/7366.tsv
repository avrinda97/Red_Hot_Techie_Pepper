2008-01-22T17:40:00.000Z	blue42		How do you set up a burning group?
2008-01-22T17:41:00.000Z	nemilar	blue42	you mean, a group that has permissions to burn CDs?
2008-01-22T17:42:00.000Z	nemilar	blue42	so why do you need a group, then?
2008-01-22T17:44:00.000Z	nemilar	blue42	you're trying to burn but you're getting Permission errors?
2008-01-22T17:45:00.000Z	nemilar	blue42	does the burn start at all, or does it fail before it begins?
2008-01-22T17:46:00.000Z	nemilar	blue42	what program are you using?  is there any more specific error?  are you sure the media is good?
2008-01-22T17:48:00.000Z	blue42	nemilar	i posted the readout from gnomebaker on the forum - i'll post the link
2008-01-22T17:57:00.000Z	blue42	nemilar	here is the link to the burning issue and the gnomebaker readout is there: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=673640
2008-01-22T18:01:00.000Z	nemilar	blue42	are you duel booting?  it looks like it could be hardware
2008-01-22T18:03:00.000Z	nemilar	blue42	the drive has always worked before, or is it a new drive?
2008-01-22T18:04:00.000Z	blue42	nemilar	and kitche could it be related to not connecting it correctly - the last DVD drive burnt out
2008-01-22T18:05:00.000Z	blue42	nemilar	it's a reasonably new drive but i haven't been able to get it to burn
2008-01-22T18:06:00.000Z	nemilar	blue42	if it hasn't burned a single disk sucessfully, I'd say it might be a hardware error
2008-01-22T18:06:00.000Z	nemilar	blue42	I've had that error come up before on a brand new drive, I RMA'd it and my replacement worked fine
2008-01-22T18:08:00.000Z	nemilar	blue42	return merchandise authorization..basically I returned the drive and got a new one
2008-01-22T18:08:00.000Z	nemilar	blue42	if there's another machine you could put it in to test it, you could try that
2008-01-22T18:09:00.000Z	nemilar	blue42	yeah, sorry about that...you could also check the IDE cable, swap in a new one...it's rare but sometimes they have faults, too
2008-01-22T18:10:00.000Z	nemilar	blue42	hope everything works out for you
