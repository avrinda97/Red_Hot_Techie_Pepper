2009-08-30T00:07:00.000Z	grawity	simplexio	he wanted to count lines, not the files themselves, I think.
2009-08-30T00:08:00.000Z	grawity	simplexio	Um, -name '*.php'
2009-08-30T00:08:00.000Z	simplexio	grawity	im yeah. thats it. i have used to use grep allways
2009-08-30T00:13:00.000Z	simplexio	grawity	i use it now and then.. i allways forgot that line
2009-09-04T19:05:00.000Z	simplexio	grawity	attleast, it would be fun if they would give you a choice
2009-09-04T19:07:00.000Z	grawity	simplexio	Imagine you are a Joe Random User, who has not much knowledge about computers, but needs to install Windows. "It's asking me if I want to overwrite the MBR. What's a MBR? I just want to install Windows."
2009-09-04T19:09:00.000Z	simplexio	grawity	sure.. i can understand that point. but it wouldnt be that hard to give users option. besides my opinion is that joe basicusers shouldnt touch computers if they dont be ready to loose all data..
2009-09-04T19:10:00.000Z	grawity	simplexio	Yeah, there could be Shift-F10 for "geek mode" (just like there already is Shift-F12 for Command Prompt)
2009-09-04T19:11:00.000Z	simplexio	grawity	or licence to use computers, so we could keep biggest idiots away
2009-09-04T19:11:00.000Z	grawity	simplexio	That's... more evil than Microsoft itself.
2009-09-04T19:12:00.000Z	simplexio	grawity	on bad day im stand 100% nbehind that.. but well somehow basicuser need to get advanced user
2009-09-06T00:44:00.000Z	grawity	simplexio	The recovery mode already goes to 'single'
2009-09-06T00:45:00.000Z	grawity	simplexio	And that one asks for root password if one is set.
2009-09-06T00:45:00.000Z	simplexio	grawity	good to know. so "allways" working way is add init=/bin/sh to boot line ?
2009-09-06T00:46:00.000Z	grawity	simplexio	Yes, as long as the root partition is not encrypted.
2009-09-06T00:46:00.000Z	grawity	simplexio	The LiveCD way should work too.
2009-09-06T00:48:00.000Z	simplexio	grawity	liveCD ? chroot into existing system and manually editing passwd? or ?. i have used 'single' boot option once
2009-09-06T00:48:00.000Z	grawity	simplexio	Not necessarily chroot; just mount the HD and edit /mnt/etc/shadow or whatever :)
