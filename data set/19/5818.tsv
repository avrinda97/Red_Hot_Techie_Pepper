2008-05-01T12:30:00.000Z	diagon		for some reason I'm typically getting less than 1k/s transfers with synaptic .............
2008-05-01T12:31:00.000Z	diagon		it's ridiculous...... also, I had to switch my eth1 and eth0 in the /etc/udev stuff, don't know if that has anything to do with it
2008-05-01T12:31:00.000Z	diagon		about 4 days for the upgrade woo hoo!
2008-05-01T12:32:00.000Z	diagon		5000b/s woo hoo!
2008-05-01T12:32:00.000Z	diagon		ok, what is this efnet?
2008-05-01T12:32:00.000Z	fde	diagon	freenode
2008-05-01T12:33:00.000Z	diagon	fde	yeah, I was joking re: the yvonne influx
2008-05-01T12:34:00.000Z	fde	diagon	No idea, what's your issue?
2008-05-01T12:34:00.000Z	diagon	fde	less than 1k/s transfers with synaptic
2008-05-01T12:36:00.000Z	fde	diagon	No, that is something unrelated... although you might want to try another mirror, which might induce the same issue if you do it wrong... heh
2008-05-01T12:36:00.000Z	diagon	fde	sounds fun! a different mirror? oh, for irc? eh I don't care about that, I'm just curious why my "language support update" is planning on taking 4 days to do itself
2008-05-01T12:37:00.000Z	fde	diagon	No, for Ubuntu/Synaptic
2008-05-01T12:37:00.000Z	fde	diagon	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Mirrors
2008-05-01T12:37:00.000Z	diagon	fde	ahhh, ok, thanks
2008-05-01T12:38:00.000Z	diagon	fde	so how do I utilize this in my sources. ....
2008-05-01T12:40:00.000Z	fde	diagon	I'm not actually sure how I should recommend you do that, so I don't think I should... there is no simple way to switch mirror via GUI
2008-05-01T12:40:00.000Z	diagon	fde	I'm kind of decently able to figure things out, so I'd appreciate any input, really
2008-05-01T12:42:00.000Z	fde	diagon	astro76: I didn't see it with a quick browse... astro76 would you care to show him/her?
2008-05-01T12:43:00.000Z	fde	diagon	In System > Administration > Software Sources ... "Download From" under the check boxes... choose "Other" and browse to a desired mirror.
