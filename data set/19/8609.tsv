2007-12-14T08:56:00.000Z	R3B3LX		that is my question >_>
2007-12-14T08:56:00.000Z	Joshooa	R3B3LX	How to work it?
2007-12-14T08:58:00.000Z	Joshooa	R3B3LX	Well you should only use Wine to install it not to download it. You may have to set write permissions
2007-12-14T08:59:00.000Z	Joshooa	R3B3LX	After it's downloaded, do wine '/Path-to-File/File.exe'
2007-12-14T09:00:00.000Z	Joshooa	R3B3LX	Well where did you download it?
2007-12-14T09:01:00.000Z	Joshooa	R3B3LX	And it doesn't bring up the installing window?
2007-12-14T09:01:00.000Z	Joshooa	R3B3LX	Have you ran winecfg yet?
2007-12-14T09:07:00.000Z	Joshooa	R3B3LX	Weird
2007-12-14T09:08:00.000Z	Joshooa	R3B3LX	You mean Default Settings?
2007-12-14T09:08:00.000Z	Joshooa	R3B3LX	Yeah that's fine
2007-12-14T09:10:00.000Z	Joshooa	R3B3LX	Do a terminal and run sudo /home/acorn/Desktop/Tukanas Hit Generator.exe
2007-12-14T09:11:00.000Z	Joshooa	R3B3LX	Whoops, I meant sudo wine
2007-12-14T09:12:00.000Z	Joshooa	R3B3LX	But if you can chmod your home .wine folder would be better
2007-12-14T09:12:00.000Z	Joshooa	R3B3LX	Yes, should be it, if that's your file
2007-12-14T09:14:00.000Z	Joshooa	R3B3LX	Yeah Windows sucks
2007-12-14T09:14:00.000Z	Joshooa	R3B3LX	Except they are driving more people towards Ubuntu
2007-12-14T09:19:00.000Z	Joshooa	R3B3LX	I just read your thing, Geek Squad doesn't know anything about computers, they just have an automated CD
