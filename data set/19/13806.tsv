2005-02-16T11:34:00.000Z	SirFred		I expect a better cd burner app for gnome, anyway. This is too simple.
2005-02-16T11:35:00.000Z	SirFred		I've got a question about hdparm.
2005-02-16T11:35:00.000Z	SirFred		I don't know why, but hoary don't activate DMA on my CDRW device.
2005-02-16T11:35:00.000Z	SirFred		So, I tried to make it with hdparm.
2005-02-16T11:35:00.000Z	tritium	SirFred	in the init scripts
2005-02-16T11:36:00.000Z	tritium	SirFred	same thing happens for me.
2005-02-16T11:37:00.000Z	SirFred	tritium	Has you fixed it in some way?
2005-02-16T11:37:00.000Z	tritium	SirFred	no, I rarely use my cdrw.  When I do, I just re-run /etc/init.d/hdparm start.
2005-02-16T11:38:00.000Z	SirFred	tritium	Yes, that's what I do.
2005-02-16T11:38:00.000Z	SirFred	tritium	But if I forget it, it doesn't burn.
2005-02-16T11:39:00.000Z	SirFred	tritium	Well, the symptoms are not the same.
2005-02-16T11:39:00.000Z	SirFred	tritium	Yes.
2005-02-16T11:40:00.000Z	SirFred	tritium	What I get is an error dialog saying that my burner is not enable to achieve that speed, or something so
2005-02-16T11:40:00.000Z	SirFred	tritium	Could be.
2005-04-18T13:53:00.000Z	SirFred	tritium	I can drag mp3 files on k3b to make an audio CD.
2005-04-18T13:53:00.000Z	SirFred	tritium	What do you mean with "not by itself" ?
2005-04-18T13:54:00.000Z	SirFred	tritium	Just make a new audio CD, and drag mp3 files on the project.
2005-04-18T13:54:00.000Z	SirFred	tritium	I've made it months ago
2005-04-18T13:56:00.000Z	SirFred	tritium	Extrange
