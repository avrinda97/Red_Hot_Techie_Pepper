2006-07-23T05:54:00.000Z	dapper		hello all
2006-07-23T05:55:00.000Z	dapper		i have a little question
2006-07-23T05:55:00.000Z	dapper		do we can make a partition with 3 physical drives
2006-07-23T05:55:00.000Z	Warbo	dapper	You want LVM
2006-07-23T05:56:00.000Z	Warbo		!lvm
2006-07-23T05:56:00.000Z	dapper	Warbo	i have 3 hd drives
2006-07-23T05:56:00.000Z	dapper	Warbo	and i would like to ake one partition with them if it is possible
2006-07-23T05:56:00.000Z	Warbo	dapper	You make partitions as "physical volumes", then group all of them into a "volume group" which acts like a big hard drive, and make "logical volumes" in that, which act like partitions
2006-07-23T05:57:00.000Z	dapper	Warbo	hou can i do that pls
2006-07-23T05:57:00.000Z	Warbo	dapper	It's called Logical Volume Management, see the link from Uboty above
2006-07-23T05:57:00.000Z	Warbo	dapper	I don't think the graphical installer supports them, you may have to use the text installer
2006-07-23T05:58:00.000Z	dapper	Warbo	could i make it without reinstalling ubuntu
2006-07-23T05:58:00.000Z	Warbo	dapper	Yes, you can make the logical volumes, mount them, then copy all of your stuff across (copying an Ubuntu system to a different drive doesn't stop it working)
2006-07-23T05:59:00.000Z	Warbo	dapper	The GRUB bootloader doesn't understand LVM though, so you will need a real partition for /boot
2006-07-23T05:59:00.000Z	dapper		in fact i have ubuntu installed on the drives
2006-07-23T05:59:00.000Z	dapper	Warbo	one fot / one for usr and one for hoe
2006-07-23T05:59:00.000Z	dapper		home
2006-07-23T06:00:00.000Z	Warbo	dapper	You can't convert existing partitions to LVM without losing data, however due to the way LVM works you can keep adding more space to it as you copy more stuff on to it, until eventually all of your stuff is stored on it
2006-07-23T06:01:00.000Z	Warbo	dapper	I would start with a GParted CD and shrink your partitions as much as possible (leave a bit of free space in / though)
