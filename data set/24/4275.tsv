2007-05-25T16:22:00.000Z	swatF1RESTORM	Pelo	that did it! there was no /examples like in the HOWTO. Do i have to reload anything before trying a DVD?
2007-05-25T16:23:00.000Z	Pelo	swatF1RESTORM	I,m not exactly sure what you just did,  I was just teling you how to run the command

2007-05-25T16:25:00.000Z	Pelo	swatF1RESTORM	try it as is
2007-05-25T16:25:00.000Z	swatF1RESTORM	Pelo	no go. removing the xine backend and trying gstreamer again to see if that works.
2007-05-25T16:27:00.000Z	Pelo	swatF1RESTORM	I don't remember my getting dvds to play to be so complex I just had to run one ded file
2007-05-25T16:28:00.000Z	Pelo	swatF1RESTORM	lol
2007-05-25T16:30:00.000Z	Pelo	swatF1RESTORM	i see why your's is more complex then mine, I haven't set up the stuff for encripted dvds on mine yet,  don't realy need it
2007-05-25T16:31:00.000Z	swatF1RESTORM	Pelo	I'm just trying to watch a DVD from netflix ,lol
2007-05-25T16:32:00.000Z	swatF1RESTORM	Pelo	Thanks
2007-05-25T08:23:00.000Z	Pelo	swatF1RESTORM	 did you check the forum for the error msg ?
2007-05-25T08:25:00.000Z	swatF1RESTORM	Pelo	I threw it in google and nothing helpful was returned
2007-05-25T08:25:00.000Z	Pelo	swatF1RESTORM	mplayer ?
2007-05-25T08:28:00.000Z	swatF1RESTORM	Pelo	No. Totem-xine... from what i've seen on the forums they just switched to Totem-gstreamer but I can only get DVDs to play correctly with Totem-xine
2007-05-25T08:29:00.000Z	Pelo	swatF1RESTORM	there is a #xine  you could try asking for their advice
2007-05-25T08:29:00.000Z	swatF1RESTORM	Pelo	didn't have a clue. I'll see if I can find the answer there.
2007-05-25T08:30:00.000Z	Pelo	swatF1RESTORM	I had to check , which is why I asked if it was mplayer, they hve a great channel
2007-05-25T08:31:00.000Z	swatF1RESTORM	Pelo	I've heard a lot of good things about mplayer. I just think it's a little out of my reach right now to configure.
2007-05-25T08:31:00.000Z	Pelo	swatF1RESTORM	I don't use it much myself  but I ear it is quite versatile  that and vlc
2007-05-25T08:32:00.000Z	swatF1RESTORM	Pelo	I couldn't get VLC to play DVDs. I used VLC in windows just because it played the most things out-of-the-box.
2007-05-25T08:33:00.000Z	Pelo	swatF1RESTORM	 something is wrong,  I can play just about anything with all the players ,  I 'm not sure what is going on on your end but you'll need to figure it out
