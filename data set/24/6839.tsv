2005-07-03T08:18:00.000Z	absinthe_		I'm using gdesklets/starterbar and I want to create a starter for Synaptic. I have but it says I must be root to use it.
2005-07-03T08:18:00.000Z	absinthe_		How can I have it ask for passwd like the shortcut in administration?
2005-07-03T08:19:00.000Z	pietro_spina	absinthe_	gksudo /usr/sbin/synaptic

2005-07-03T08:20:00.000Z	pietro_spina	absinthe_	np
2005-07-03T08:38:00.000Z	pietro_spina	absinthe_	I think ubuntu just gived you the client... sshd is not running by default..
2005-07-03T08:38:00.000Z	pietro_spina	absinthe_	gived =gives
2005-07-03T08:39:00.000Z	absinthe_	pietro_spina	Thanks
2005-07-03T08:41:00.000Z	pietro_spina	absinthe_	if you run the ssh server per cast's example be sure you have srtong passwords as you will be scanned....
2005-07-03T08:42:00.000Z	pietro_spina	absinthe_	It's real no big deal though, just fills up some logs :-)
2005-07-03T08:42:00.000Z	absinthe_	pietro_spina	heh, ok. I don't use ssh so I'm removing i
2005-07-03T08:43:00.000Z	pietro_spina	absinthe_	I altered the port i run it on...
2005-07-03T08:43:00.000Z	pietro_spina	absinthe_	oh... then that will save you like whole 100kb of space hehehe
2005-07-03T08:44:00.000Z	absinthe_	pietro_spina	Bah! I'm paranoid so I removed it. lol
2005-07-03T08:44:00.000Z	absinthe_	pietro_spina	I'm also a space-freak. I need every available kb of free space. I'm rather obsessive about it =)
2005-07-03T08:45:00.000Z	pietro_spina	absinthe_	I was getting an almost constant scan from Sogang University In Korea untill I changed th port.... (grin) now nothing...
2005-07-03T08:46:00.000Z	absinthe_	pietro_spina	Pluggin the holes in your boat? =)
2005-07-03T08:46:00.000Z	pietro_spina	absinthe_	so you used to defrag everyother day in your windows days?
2005-07-03T08:46:00.000Z	absinthe_	pietro_spina	lol, yes
2005-07-03T08:47:00.000Z	absinthe_	pietro_spina	I'd uninstall programs that I hadn't used for awhile then reinstall them days later all the time
2005-07-03T08:48:00.000Z	pietro_spina	absinthe_	they kept trying to login as root and a dictionary of passwords... but I had disabled  remote root login they were just banging on the door and filling my logs... hehe
2005-07-03T08:49:00.000Z	pietro_spina	absinthe_	I used to do that... now I'm just a distro junkie...
2005-07-03T08:49:00.000Z	absinthe_	pietro_spina	Heh, some people are persistent.
2005-07-03T08:50:00.000Z	pietro_spina	absinthe_	code red worms even more so....
