2005-01-18T17:51:00.000Z	trey3	Enmity	http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/RestrictedFormats
2005-01-18T06:07:00.000Z	trey3	Enmity	no
2005-01-18T06:13:00.000Z	trey3	Enmity	define "usable"
2005-01-18T06:14:00.000Z	trey3	Enmity	http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/RestrictedFormats  <-- install things that you see there... thats a good start  :)
2005-01-18T06:15:00.000Z	trey3	Enmity	that is if you define usable as "I want to play movies and mp3's and I want java to work, and flash"
2005-01-18T06:15:00.000Z	trey3	Enmity	after that, it really depends...
2005-01-18T06:17:00.000Z	trey3	Enmity	Evolution should be all you need for e-mail...
2005-01-18T06:17:00.000Z	trey3	Enmity	wireless is a little more complicated...
2005-01-18T06:18:00.000Z	trey3	Enmity	do you know what kinda wireless card you have?
2005-01-18T06:18:00.000Z	trey3	Enmity	lsmod | grep prism
2005-01-18T06:19:00.000Z	trey3	Enmity	you should see prism3, else modprobe prism3
2005-01-18T06:20:00.000Z	trey3	Enmity	hmm... ok... Computer > System Settings > Networking
2005-01-18T06:22:00.000Z	trey3	Enmity	but yeah... ifup wlan0 ... tell me what it says.
2005-01-18T06:24:00.000Z	Enmity	trey3	it said Ignoring unknown interface wlan0=wlan0.
2005-01-18T06:26:00.000Z	trey3	Enmity	ahh... my knowledge of wireless cards has been used up already... I really need to play with one on Linux  :(
2005-01-18T06:30:00.000Z	trey3	Enmity	http://www.linuxforums.org/forum/post-147332.html   see if thats any help...
2005-01-18T06:31:00.000Z	trey3	Enmity	apparently prism54 is b0rked in 2.6.8
2005-01-18T06:42:00.000Z	Enmity	trey3	I did a ifconfig and now I have a eth1 with the wireless cards mac
2005-01-18T06:43:00.000Z	trey3	Enmity	hmm... go into Computer > System Settings > Networking and try to configure it  :)
2005-01-18T06:43:00.000Z	trey3	Enmity	wierd that it would be ethx though  :/
2005-01-18T06:44:00.000Z	trey3	Enmity	not sure if its in Warty, but there is a useful Wireless applet that you might be interested in to check/help configure the wireless card also  :)
2005-01-18T06:54:00.000Z	Enmity	trey3	hey thanks for your help - I *think* its working but have to go before I miss last train lol
2005-01-18T06:54:00.000Z	trey3	Enmity	heh... k... later  :)
