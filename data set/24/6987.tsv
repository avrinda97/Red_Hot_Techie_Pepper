2005-05-25T14:15:00.000Z	seth		Hey guys. I'm having a little problem with my PS/2 mouse. For some reason, every few minutes, it goes nuts and gets stuck in the top right corner. Doesn't matter how I move it, it only downs down the right side and across the top. It stops when I close the monitor, but it still happens a good 5 minutes later.
2005-05-25T14:17:00.000Z	seth		Anyone know?
2005-05-25T14:18:00.000Z	eyequeue	seth	 i had that once upon a time in debian, on another box
2005-05-25T14:19:00.000Z	eyequeue	seth	 i solved it by running gpm as a repeater, and then telling x my mouse was /dev/gpmdata
2005-05-25T14:19:00.000Z	seth	eyequeue	 huh?
2005-05-25T14:19:00.000Z	eyequeue	seth	 gpm (general purpose mouse) is for the mouse in console, and don't always get along with x
2005-05-25T14:20:00.000Z	eyequeue	seth	 that can cause those symptoms, and the solution is to tell x to read the named pipe gpm creates, rather than the actual hardware device
2005-05-25T14:21:00.000Z	seth	eyequeue	 how do I do that?
2005-05-25T14:22:00.000Z	eyequeue	seth	 /etc/gpm.conf device=/dev/psaux repeat_type=ms3
2005-05-25T14:25:00.000Z	seth	eyequeue	 gpm.conf is already set to what you said.
2005-05-25T14:26:00.000Z	eyequeue	seth	 i'm out of ideas, just remembering how the fix was in debian, a year or three ago
2005-05-25T14:26:00.000Z	seth	eyequeue	 I just installed gpm though...
2005-05-25T14:27:00.000Z	seth	eyequeue	 so, hopefully, it will work now?
2005-05-25T14:28:00.000Z	eyequeue	seth	 you may want  to reboot to be sure things load in the right order, i suppose
2005-05-25T14:28:00.000Z	eyequeue	seth	 i'm not fluent enough to know what needs to come first to walk you through it (nor can i guarantee it will make a difference)
2005-05-25T14:31:00.000Z	eyequeue	seth	 a thought: learn some bash scripting, and then no need to leave linux? :)
2005-05-25T14:31:00.000Z	seth	eyequeue	 I HAD to take VB in school...
2005-05-25T14:32:00.000Z	eyequeue	seth	 okay, consider me your teacher:  SETH!  Learn bash scripting NOW!  you have three months until the exam!! :P
2005-05-25T14:32:00.000Z	seth	eyequeue	 ah shit!
2005-05-25T14:33:00.000Z	eyequeue	seth	 seriously, python is very popular with ubuntu developers
2005-05-25T14:33:00.000Z	eyequeue	seth	 sudo apt-get install diveintopython to get a whole book on it :)
2005-05-25T14:35:00.000Z	seth	eyequeue	 I already have it apprearently.
2005-05-25T14:53:00.000Z	eyequeue	seth	 --no-act
2005-05-25T14:53:00.000Z	eyequeue	seth	 apt-cache search foo
