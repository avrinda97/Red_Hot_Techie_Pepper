2009-08-13T06:36:00.000Z	bucky	newuser	what's your mount point for the 20G partition? did you make that / ?
2009-08-13T06:38:00.000Z	newuser	bucky	i dont understand, i am really bad with computing
2009-08-13T06:38:00.000Z	bucky	newuser	are you installing?
2009-08-13T06:40:00.000Z	bucky	newuser	when you make a partition to install to you need to mount the root file system to the partition which is described as /   ...that is the top level file
2009-08-13T06:40:00.000Z	bucky	newuser	you have to be able to read
2009-08-13T06:41:00.000Z	bucky	newuser	no because you haven't answered any of my questions... what are you doing.. are you installing?
2009-08-13T06:41:00.000Z	bucky	newuser	and now it says you don't have enough space on your drive?
2009-08-13T06:42:00.000Z	bucky	newuser	type df -h    how much of "mounted on /" is used  ..what percentage?
2009-08-13T06:43:00.000Z	bucky	newuser	ok

2009-08-13T06:46:00.000Z	bucky	newuser	type df -h    how much of "mounted on /" is used  ..what percentage?
2009-08-13T06:49:00.000Z	bucky	newuser	are you making your own repository mirror?
