2008-12-15T01:24:00.000Z	dutchbuntu		Can anyone help me pairing my Ubuntu laptop and my Nokia 6300 via bluetooth?
2008-12-15T01:25:00.000Z	Slart	dutchbuntu	ok.. I'll give it a try.. what have you tried so far?
2008-12-15T01:25:00.000Z	dutchbuntu	Slart	thanx
2008-12-15T01:26:00.000Z	Slart	dutchbuntu	do you see the little bluetooth icon in the task tray?
2008-12-15T01:26:00.000Z	Slart	dutchbuntu	ok.. have you tried right clicking on that bluetooth icon and chosing "Setup new device"?
2008-12-15T01:27:00.000Z	Slart	dutchbuntu	ok.. you don't get some kind of "Enter pin number" dialog?
2008-12-15T01:27:00.000Z	dutchbuntu	Slart	no
2008-12-15T01:27:00.000Z	Slart	dutchbuntu	ok.. I've got my cell phone here.. I'll just delete the pairing I've got and try to set it up again..
2008-12-15T01:30:00.000Z	Slart	dutchbuntu	hmm.. I just get "Pairing with Nokia 5310 failed"
2008-12-15T01:31:00.000Z	dutchbuntu	Slart	I got the same thing
2008-12-15T01:31:00.000Z	dutchbuntu	Slart	believe it or not, now it's working
2008-12-15T01:32:00.000Z	dutchbuntu	Slart	I didn't change anything and suddenly my phone is recognized and I can pair it
2008-12-15T01:32:00.000Z	Slart	dutchbuntu	did you do anything special? =)
2008-12-15T01:32:00.000Z	dutchbuntu	Slart	I wish =)
2008-12-15T01:32:00.000Z	Slart	dutchbuntu	this is most unfair.. now it doesn't work for me.. is there a limit on how many bluetooth pairing there can be in the world at one time?? I think you took my slot =)
2008-12-15T01:33:00.000Z	dutchbuntu	Slart	I am now connected to slart-dekstop, is that a problem?
2008-12-15T01:34:00.000Z	Slart	dutchbuntu	hehe..
2008-12-15T01:34:00.000Z	dutchbuntu	Slart	sorry mate, wish I could help you. Thanx for trying, though...
2008-12-15T01:35:00.000Z	Slart	dutchbuntu	no worries.. I just hope mine starts working out of the blue too =)
2008-12-15T01:42:00.000Z	Slart	dutchbuntu	that's odd.. it worked if I initiated the pairing from the cell phone.. but not if from ubuntu
2008-12-15T01:44:00.000Z	dutchbuntu	Slart	Initially, it wouldn't work, whether I started from my phone or from my computer. Eventually, it worked when I started from my computer. It seems to lose the connection, though...
2008-12-15T01:49:00.000Z	Slart	dutchbuntu	hmm.. I can't transfer files from/to my cell phone either.. I could do that on 8.04
2008-12-15T01:49:00.000Z	Slart	dutchbuntu	but they've changed the bluetooth tools.. might be a new bug
2008-12-15T01:51:00.000Z	Slart	dutchbuntu	seems like it's a common problem with intrepid, http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=964139
