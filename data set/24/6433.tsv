2005-10-15T12:42:00.000Z	sector10	nalioth	should the proxy server check box be deselected in Xchat?
2005-10-15T12:42:00.000Z	nalioth	sector10	if you dont have a proxy server, you dont need the box checked
2005-10-15T12:42:00.000Z	sector10	nalioth	they are all checked by default
2005-10-15T12:43:00.000Z	sector10	nalioth	all the networks in Xchat have proxy server checked by default, so thats the problem
