2008-08-10T17:31:00.000Z	histo		Huh i'm connected to here but I can't get to any websites.
2008-08-10T17:31:00.000Z	histo		Also pidgin is working but no urls. It appears my dns is down from my isp?
2008-08-10T17:31:00.000Z	histo		Is this an accurate assumption?
2008-08-10T17:32:00.000Z	histo		No I can ping google and it resolves but I can't go there in a browser
2008-08-10T17:34:00.000Z	histo		Its like google has taken over
2008-08-10T17:35:00.000Z	drazak	histo	wait
2008-08-10T17:35:00.000Z	drazak	histo	echo '4.2.2.1' > /etc/resolv.conf
2008-08-10T17:37:00.000Z	drazak	histo	did you try the command?
2008-08-10T17:37:00.000Z	histo	drazak	I'm getting permission denied when I try to echo that with sudo for some reson but I can go in and just edit the file.
2008-08-10T17:38:00.000Z	drazak	histo	ok
2008-08-10T17:38:00.000Z	histo	drazak	do you just want me to add that nameserver
2008-08-10T17:38:00.000Z	drazak	histo	yeah, sorry, nameserver 4.2.2.1, but put it at the top
2008-08-10T17:38:00.000Z	drazak	histo	the way the linux resolver works is to ping them from the top down, and if it receives a ping reply, it uses that one, even if their nameserver is not working
2008-08-10T17:39:00.000Z	histo	drazak	do I need to restart the nameserver?
2008-08-10T17:39:00.000Z	histo	drazak	err the interface
2008-08-10T17:39:00.000Z	drazak	histo	no
2008-08-10T17:39:00.000Z	histo	drazak	Yeah its working now
2008-08-10T17:39:00.000Z	drazak	histo	it polls them every time you send a dns request
2008-08-10T17:40:00.000Z	drazak	histo	that's not the perfect fix, as others have mentioned, but it'll let you do some research to find out what you want to set your router to for a nameserver
2008-08-10T17:40:00.000Z	histo	drazak	well who's nameserver is that?
2008-08-10T17:40:00.000Z	drazak	histo	internic
2008-08-10T17:41:00.000Z	histo	drazak	its faster then my isp
2008-08-10T17:47:00.000Z	histo	drazak	where did you find that dns server?
2008-08-10T17:48:00.000Z	drazak	histo	my brain
