2009-02-21T15:46:00.000Z	ZachFlem		anyone?
2009-02-21T15:46:00.000Z	ikonia	ZachFlem	saying anyone is pointless, if they didn't see the question, anyone won't tell them it, if they don't know - anyone won't make them know
2009-02-21T15:47:00.000Z	ZachFlem	ikonia	would be nice if the question was at least acknowledged.
2009-02-21T15:48:00.000Z	ikonia	ZachFlem	it's a busy room, people will answer if they saw the question and know how to answer
2009-02-21T15:48:00.000Z	ikonia	ZachFlem	people ackowledging a question they don't want to/can't answer is just noise
2009-02-21T15:49:00.000Z	ikonia	ZachFlem	what's the problem with using the ubuntu install cd ?
2009-02-21T15:50:00.000Z	ZachFlem	ikonia	i want to make a backup of /home/zach before i build a clean install. but i cant seem to xfer the files to the winxp laptop via the network.
2009-02-21T15:50:00.000Z	ikonia	ZachFlem	whats the problem
2009-02-21T15:51:00.000Z	ZachFlem	ikonia	i can browse /home/zach from the windows machine, but i get "Cannot copy XXX.XX: Access Denied"
2009-02-21T15:51:00.000Z	ikonia	ZachFlem	sounds like your username your using to connect as is wrong
2009-02-21T15:52:00.000Z	ikonia	ZachFlem	I suggest just pulling them off with scp/ftp if your not confident with permissions
2009-02-21T15:52:00.000Z	ZachFlem	ikonia	permissions dont bother me, im just lost, i have vreated a user on the samba share with the credentials of windows user and still no luck.
2009-02-21T16:28:00.000Z	ikonia	ZachFlem	install from ubuntu cd - open package manager and remove any packages you don't wwant
2009-02-21T16:29:00.000Z	ZachFlem	ikonia	i would rather go the other way and install the things i need. any suggestions on a guide?
2009-02-21T16:30:00.000Z	ikonia	ZachFlem	no - use the official ubuntu CD and just remove what you don't want
2009-03-03T14:15:00.000Z	ikonia	ZachFlem	uname -a
2009-03-03T14:20:00.000Z	ikonia	ZachFlem	then ask a question
2009-03-03T14:21:00.000Z	ikonia	ZachFlem	eomtes aren't needed
2009-03-03T14:21:00.000Z	ZachFlem	ikonia	i have been, but im not getting anywhere =(
2009-03-03T14:25:00.000Z	ikonia	ZachFlem	is it getting an IP address vid dhcp
2009-03-03T14:27:00.000Z	ikonia	ZachFlem	so it does get an ip address ?
2009-03-03T14:27:00.000Z	ZachFlem	ikonia	yes it does
