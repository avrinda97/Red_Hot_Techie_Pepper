2007-04-18T08:59:00.000Z	Pelo	linos	 if you need to do this because of beryl , consider asking in #beryl or #ubuntu-effects
2007-10-05T08:06:00.000Z	Pelo	linos	just to a search for wrapper in synaptic
2007-10-05T08:07:00.000Z	Pelo	linos	 use the search feature fo look for the package you need
2007-10-05T08:08:00.000Z	Pelo	linos	 narrows you search, or broaden it , search for cups or for wrapper
2007-10-05T08:11:00.000Z	Pelo	linos	 close synapticfirst
2007-10-05T08:14:00.000Z	Pelo	linos	 find the package in the synaptic list,  remove it , then reinstall it
2007-10-05T08:17:00.000Z	Pelo	linos	I just checked and I can find no such package in synaptic on my comp

2007-10-05T08:23:00.000Z	Pelo	linos	 when you open synaptic,  check on the bottom left corner , see the buttons click the filter one,  see if you have broken packages,  if you do , select for reinstallation
