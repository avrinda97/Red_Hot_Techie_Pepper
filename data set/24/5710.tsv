2006-10-09T12:09:00.000Z	Tonren		Hey guys, does the flash navigation on the top of this page work for anyone? http://www.v3ga.net/processing/BlobDetection/
2006-10-09T12:10:00.000Z	Terminus	Tonren	doesn't work for me here.
2006-10-09T12:10:00.000Z	Tonren	Terminus	It works in Windows and Mac.  :\
2006-10-09T12:10:00.000Z	Terminus	Tonren	i'm using opera 9 and flash 7 on dapper.
2006-10-09T12:10:00.000Z	Tonren	Terminus	Me too.
2006-10-09T12:10:00.000Z	Tonren	Terminus	It doesn't work in Firefox either.
2006-10-09T12:12:00.000Z	Terminus	Tonren	maybe it's the JS script you're using there.
2006-10-09T12:12:00.000Z	Tonren	Terminus	Wha - huh?  I'm not using any JavaScript.  Oh!  Oh.  This isn't my site.
2006-10-09T12:12:00.000Z	Tonren	Terminus	I would never commit the cardinal sin of having NO SUPPORT for non-Flash player browsers.
2006-10-09T12:13:00.000Z	Terminus	Tonren	oh... hehehe. i did a quick scan of the code and they're using JS to stick SWF on it.
2006-10-09T12:13:00.000Z	Tonren	Terminus	What a horrible website
2006-10-09T12:15:00.000Z	Terminus	Tonren	scifi.com/battlestar/ is the latest site that's been bugging me. =|
2006-10-09T12:15:00.000Z	Tonren	Terminus	The sad thing is, last week, I got really frustrated with Linux.  I said, "I've had enough!  I've had enough of compatibility errors and all of this nonsense.  I'M GOING BACK TO WINDOWS."
2006-10-09T12:16:00.000Z	Tonren	Terminus	I booted into Windows and started going about my business.  Within 10 minutes, the Windows updater wanted to reset, programs were crashing, I was getting spyware and I missed the command line.
2006-10-09T12:16:00.000Z	Tonren	Terminus	I went right back to Linux.
2006-10-09T12:17:00.000Z	Terminus	Tonren	lol. once you get used to linux, it isn't really that difficult anyway. and using the command line really gives you a lot of power. i just miss the multimedia apps on windows though. =|
2006-10-09T12:17:00.000Z	Tonren	Terminus	I just miss things WORKING.  I miss Flash working without bugs, I miss my 5-in-1 card reader, I miss connecting to an external monitor without having to restart.
2006-10-09T12:17:00.000Z	Tonren	Terminus	I miss Photoshop the most.  I hate running it through Crossover Office.
2006-10-09T12:18:00.000Z	Tonren	Terminus	I'm of the opinion that Linux will stay crippled forever without third party support.
2006-10-09T12:18:00.000Z	Terminus	Tonren	just use whatever works for you. i used to run windows apps in wine too before i got tired of all the tweaking. now i just use windows if i need it. i do hope that linux will eventually have decent third party support though.
2006-10-09T12:19:00.000Z	Tonren	Terminus	I can't stand booting into Windows, you know?  Maybe I'll try out VMWare sometime.
2006-10-09T12:20:00.000Z	Terminus	Tonren	just make sure you've got a computer that can handle it. VMWare isn't really as fast as native when i tried it last time. and forget about DirectX in VMWare.
2006-10-09T12:20:00.000Z	Tonren	Terminus	I have a good box, but it's far from top of the line.
2006-10-09T12:20:00.000Z	Tonren	Terminus	It couldn't handle XGL/Compiz.
