2007-07-11T14:43:00.000Z	puff		Can anybody help me troubleshoot a wireless problem?
2007-07-11T14:43:00.000Z	jamman	puff	shoot away.
2007-07-11T14:44:00.000Z	jamman	puff	sure you have the wifi network set up right?
2007-07-11T14:46:00.000Z	puff	jamman	Obviously *something* isn't right :-(.
2007-07-11T14:46:00.000Z	jamman	puff	double check passwords, etc.
2007-07-11T14:47:00.000Z	jamman	puff	also duble check that you can ping local machines. thirdly, if you're using wpa, i recommend turning it off for the moment for testing purposes.
2007-07-11T14:47:00.000Z	puff	jamman	I can't ping local machines either.
2007-07-11T14:48:00.000Z	jamman	puff	well then. turn off wpa or wep protection for the moment.
2007-07-11T14:48:00.000Z	puff	jamman	I'm not using wpa/wep.  I'm using ssh.
2007-07-11T14:49:00.000Z	jamman	puff	ssh how? wireless, right?
2007-07-11T14:49:00.000Z	puff	jamman	Yah.  I'm not using wpa/wep.  I'm relying on application level encryption.
2007-07-11T14:49:00.000Z	jamman	puff	got it.
2007-07-11T14:50:00.000Z	jamman	puff	well, do, "ifconfig" and look for a wlan0 or an ra0 or something like that. the lo you can ignore.
2007-07-11T14:50:00.000Z	jamman	puff	once you do that, you need to look for an ip addres there.
2007-07-11T14:52:00.000Z	puff	jamman	It's eth1.
2007-07-11T14:52:00.000Z	jamman	puff	is there an ip address for it?
2007-07-11T14:54:00.000Z	puff	jamman	Yeah.
2007-07-11T14:54:00.000Z	puff	jamman	Yes, there's an ip address for eth1.
2007-07-11T14:55:00.000Z	jamman	puff	well try "sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart" just to double check.
2007-07-11T14:55:00.000Z	puff	jamman	It's not responding to outside pings, either.
2007-07-11T14:55:00.000Z	puff	jamman	Doh.. I really hsould have thought of trying /etc/init.d.
2007-07-11T14:55:00.000Z	jamman	puff	also are you using a static ip?
2007-07-11T14:55:00.000Z	jamman	puff	its a handy little tool.
2007-07-11T15:13:00.000Z	puff	jamman	No, still no joy.  /etc/init.d didn't help.
