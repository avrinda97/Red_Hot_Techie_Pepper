2009-03-23T02:16:00.000Z	millertime_018		E: Couldn't find package zlib
2009-03-23T02:17:00.000Z	millertime_018		i need to install a package called zlib. can anyone help me?
2009-03-23T02:17:00.000Z	jrib	millertime_018	why?
2009-03-23T02:17:00.000Z	millertime_018	jrib	it's listed but the terminal says it couldn't find the package called zlib
2009-03-23T02:18:00.000Z	jrib	millertime_018	that's not the package name.  See ubottu's info on how to properly search for packages
2009-03-23T02:19:00.000Z	millertime_018	jrib	i already know how to install stuff
2009-03-23T02:20:00.000Z	jrib	millertime_018	do you know how to search for packages?
2009-03-23T02:20:00.000Z	millertime_018	jrib	what i'm saying is that it can't find the package when i run the command
2009-03-23T02:20:00.000Z	millertime_018	jrib	no
2009-03-23T02:20:00.000Z	jrib	millertime_018	ok, then please take a few minutes to learn
2009-03-23T02:20:00.000Z	jrib	millertime_018	for example: apt-cache search -n zlib
2009-03-23T02:21:00.000Z	millertime_018	jrib	durt: i'm looking here and i'm trying to follow the instructions
2009-03-23T02:22:00.000Z	jrib	millertime_018	you probably need -dev
2009-03-23T04:48:00.000Z	jrib	millertime_018	that's like asking "where is 12 main st. {city where you live}"
2009-03-23T04:48:00.000Z	millertime_018	jrib	i'm following directions from this site: http://wiki.enlightenment.org/index.php/E17_User_Guide/Starting_from_a_graphical_login_manager
2009-03-23T04:48:00.000Z	jrib	millertime_018	k?
2009-03-23T04:49:00.000Z	jrib	millertime_018	I'm guessing $PREFIX means the place you installed it to...
2009-03-23T04:50:00.000Z	millertime_018	jrib	well i installed in to home...
2009-03-23T04:50:00.000Z	jrib	millertime_018	then prefix is home...
