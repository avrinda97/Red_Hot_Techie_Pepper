2006-07-25T07:55:00.000Z	jrib	CarinArr	try use a different font, the microsoft ones show up like that for me too.  But if I set preferences to use my own fonts (bitstream vera sans I think) it looks good
2006-07-25T07:55:00.000Z	jrib	CarinArr	s/use/using
2006-07-25T07:56:00.000Z	CarinArr	jrib	the weird thing is that firefox uses the same fonts on both my machines and one looks perfect, the ohter looks crap
2006-07-25T07:57:00.000Z	jrib	CarinArr	are you sure the other machine has the microsoft fonts installed?  If you don't install them, then the machine defaults to what it can find
2006-07-25T07:58:00.000Z	CarinArr	jrib	er.. don't know.. let me look
2006-07-25T08:00:00.000Z	CarinArr	jrib	i don't think i have ms fonts installed..
2006-07-25T08:00:00.000Z	jrib	CarinArr	on the machine with the bad firefox fonts you mean?
2006-07-25T08:00:00.000Z	CarinArr	jrib	yeah
2006-07-25T08:02:00.000Z	jrib	CarinArr	set preferences > content > fonts > advanced to always use your own fonts, and see if that fixes it.  That should at least tell you if it is a font selection problem.  You could also check the antialias settings in system > preferences > fonts
2006-07-25T08:05:00.000Z	CarinArr	jrib	if i tell it always to use my fonts it looks fine
2006-07-25T08:06:00.000Z	jrib	CarinArr	that is what I do, I don't know if there is a way to make the other fonts look smoother
2006-07-27T16:26:00.000Z	jrib	CarinArr	texinfo
2006-10-31T10:13:00.000Z	jrib	CarinArr	right click > properties > audio video tab
2006-10-31T10:13:00.000Z	CarinArr	jrib	err right click..
2006-10-31T10:14:00.000Z	jrib	CarinArr	in nautilus
2006-10-31T10:14:00.000Z	jrib	CarinArr	if you have mplayer, you can use 'mplayer -identify file.avi'
2006-10-31T10:16:00.000Z	CarinArr	jrib	mplayer doesn't do anything, and properties in nautilus just says "unknown" on all
2006-10-31T10:17:00.000Z	jrib	CarinArr	expand on "doesn't do anything", does it give you output?
2006-10-31T10:18:00.000Z	jrib	CarinArr	well the best option might be for you to just install all the stuff on the page ubotu linked you to anyway, regardless of what the codec is
2006-10-31T10:19:00.000Z	CarinArr	jrib	i thought i had already
2006-10-31T10:19:00.000Z	jrib	CarinArr	k, did you grab w32codecs as well?
2006-10-31T10:20:00.000Z	CarinArr	jrib	no i didn't actually.. i seemed to remember it being available in synaptic but couldnt' find it in edgy
2006-10-31T10:20:00.000Z	jrib	CarinArr	nope, you have to download the deb
2006-10-31T10:20:00.000Z	jrib	CarinArr	or you can use edgy-seveas repo
