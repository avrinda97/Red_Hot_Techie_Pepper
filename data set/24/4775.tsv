2007-05-22T07:45:00.000Z	CarlFK		does the live CD install and the 'alternate install (text based installer)' leave you with the same things installed ?
2007-05-22T07:45:00.000Z	Pici	CarlFK	Yes.
2007-05-22T07:45:00.000Z	CarlFK	Pici	thanks.
2007-06-13T11:18:00.000Z	Pici	CarlFK	Similar to the temps I get, but you probablyget more information asking in ##hardware
2007-10-03T09:02:00.000Z	Pici	CarlFK	I *think* its `gpg --gen-key` but check the manpages
2007-10-26T03:01:00.000Z	CarlFK	Pici	think the restricted driver would be any better, or is it the hardware that is tweaked ?
2007-10-26T03:02:00.000Z	Pici	CarlFK	I'd ask in #compiz-fusion if people hav reported success with that card despite it being blacklisted
2007-10-26T03:02:00.000Z	CarlFK	Pici	thanks
2007-10-26T03:07:00.000Z	CarlFK	Pici	 ATI Mobility: .. x700 isn't listed on http://wiki.compiz-fusion.org/Hardware/Blacklist/   - my cards pci id: 1002:5652
2007-10-26T03:08:00.000Z	Pici	CarlFK	I checked with the CF guys before I added it to the factoid, they ensured me it was blacklisted.
2007-10-26T03:08:00.000Z	CarlFK	Pici	thanks.
2007-12-01T00:02:00.000Z	Pici	CarlFK	use `vncveiwer host:screennum` or `vncviewer host portnum`
2007-12-01T00:03:00.000Z	CarlFK	Pici	unable to connect to host: Invalid argument (22)
2007-12-01T00:05:00.000Z	Pici	CarlFK	oops, I misread the manpage.  Try doing host::22 (or whatever port)
2007-12-01T00:07:00.000Z	Pici	CarlFK	I dont, I remember it from another vnc client.
2008-08-04T19:22:00.000Z	Pici	CarlFK	No, major kernel revisions will never be backported.

2009-01-20T00:25:00.000Z	CarlFK	Pici	thanks for making me look again - I mised libboost-dev, which looks like it has most of them as deps
2009-01-30T23:32:00.000Z	Pici	CarlFK	Each package says what arches it supports
2009-01-30T23:34:00.000Z	Pici	CarlFK	Check out the apt-get source if you're really curious.
2011-10-19T23:55:00.000Z	Pici	CarlFK	dpkg -l | grep '^ii'
