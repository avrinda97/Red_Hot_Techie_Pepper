2009-11-22T21:27:00.000Z	vistro	ltgg	okay, first off, you will have to use the terminal
2009-11-22T21:28:00.000Z	vistro	ltgg	It's okay, I will form the command for you, all you will do is copy it, and ctrl+shift+v it into your terminal
2009-11-22T21:29:00.000Z	vistro	ltgg	try this command:
2009-11-22T21:32:00.000Z	ltgg	vistro	thanks ... that made me owner. Drive is still in group 'root' but I can now use it.
