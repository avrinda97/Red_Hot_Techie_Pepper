2005-03-11T06:41:00.000Z	thoreauputic	calamari	look at it this way -  probably your issues and the answers have helped others understand the system better
2005-08-07T13:17:00.000Z	thoreauputic	calamari	I wonder if when you upgraded you didn't have the ubuntu-desktop metapackage installed?
2005-08-07T13:17:00.000Z	calamari	thoreauputic	I did apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
2005-08-07T13:18:00.000Z	thoreauputic	calamari	OK
