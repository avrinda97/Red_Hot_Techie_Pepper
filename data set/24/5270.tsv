2007-07-14T15:32:00.000Z	cerda		help i cant get back into ubuntu its at a  blue screen somthing about x server
2007-07-14T15:33:00.000Z	cerda		can anyone help
2007-07-14T15:35:00.000Z	xhaan	cerda	what did you do before that happened? sounds like you broke xorg or xorg.conf
2007-07-14T15:36:00.000Z	xhaan	cerda	yeah its fixable if you undo what you changed
2007-07-14T15:37:00.000Z	xhaan	cerda	or find why theres an error and correct it
2007-07-14T15:37:00.000Z	xhaan	cerda	you could try recovery mode to edit your xorg.conf
2007-07-14T15:38:00.000Z	cerda	xhaan	ill try that
2007-07-14T15:38:00.000Z	xhaan	cerda	its non gui though, youll have to use command line til you fix xorg
2007-07-14T15:40:00.000Z	xhaan	cerda	probably an error or wrong setting in xorg conf
2007-07-14T15:46:00.000Z	xhaan	cerda	i duno if i can, but i can look anyways :0
2007-07-14T15:50:00.000Z	xhaan	cerda	your fglrx driver may not have installed correctly
2007-07-14T15:50:00.000Z	cerda	xhaan	wat can i do?
2007-07-14T15:50:00.000Z	xhaan	cerda	try going into xorg.conf and change fglrx back to what it was before and see if it works then
2007-07-14T15:55:00.000Z	cerda	xhaan	wen i checked wat you told me it was already ati, so i rebooted, and it works
2007-07-14T15:55:00.000Z	xhaan	cerda	at least i was close lol
2007-07-14T15:55:00.000Z	xhaan	cerda	glad it works now
2007-07-14T15:57:00.000Z	xhaan	cerda	i never installed beryl before, just compiz
2007-07-14T15:59:00.000Z	cerda	xhaan	i just checked that out right now, it looks tite
2007-07-14T16:08:00.000Z	cerda	xhaan	sorry for bothering you so much, but i downloaded the compiz, but idk much about ubuntu, wat do i use to install, like a exe or wat
2007-07-14T16:09:00.000Z	xhaan	cerda	its similar to how you installed beryl, youll probably have to search for a howto
2007-07-14T16:09:00.000Z	cerda	xhaan	ok thx
2007-07-14T16:14:00.000Z	xhaan	cerda	not natively
2007-07-14T16:14:00.000Z	xhaan	cerda	wine might work
2007-07-14T16:19:00.000Z	xhaan	cerda	yup
