2008-03-15T07:47:00.000Z	joanki		can anyone help me?
2008-03-15T07:47:00.000Z	joanki		can anyone tell me of a good hardware room?
2008-03-15T07:47:00.000Z	joanki		i dropped my computer and now the battery doesn't seem to last as long
2008-03-15T07:47:00.000Z	joanki		i want to find out what is causing this
2008-03-15T07:47:00.000Z	joanki		and if maybe i broke something , causing my computer to work harder
2008-03-15T07:48:00.000Z	stefano_	joanki	it just seems you broke some cells in your battery
2008-03-15T07:48:00.000Z	joanki	stefano_	how do i know if that's the only thing broke?
2008-03-15T07:48:00.000Z	joanki	stefano_	do they break easily?
2008-03-15T07:49:00.000Z	stefano_	joanki	if they drop, sometimes a cell breaks (laptop batteries are made of 4 to12 different cells). sometimes, this can be very dangerous
2008-03-15T07:50:00.000Z	joanki	stefano_	dangerouus?
2008-03-15T07:51:00.000Z	stefano_	joanki	maybe, i'm not sure i was just guessing. but batteries deprecciate in capacity just over time, how dramatic is it?
2008-03-15T07:52:00.000Z	stefano_	joanki	well that could be caused by a software issue, thats not so dramatic. do you have cpu frequency scaling enabled? (the thing that clocks your processor down if you don't use it so much)
2008-03-15T07:53:00.000Z	joanki	stefano_	if everything works, then should i not be concerned?
2008-03-15T07:54:00.000Z	stefano_	joanki	when you click on the little battery icon near your clock, then on "laptop battery" (or similar), it should show a status report on your battery, if something is damaged it would appear in there. also, it shows how much of your batteries factory capacity is left. that should give you a clue.
2008-03-15T07:55:00.000Z	joanki	stefano_	wow thanks for all your information
2008-03-15T07:56:00.000Z	joanki	stefano_	could it also be because i've been running virtualbox and i don't normally do that?
2008-03-15T07:56:00.000Z	stefano_	joanki	yes it can be, virtualbox does drain a lot of power because it is very cpu intense
2008-03-15T07:57:00.000Z	stefano_	joanki	i'm glad i could help
2008-03-15T08:18:00.000Z	joanki	stefano_	do you know what it means... when i look up system monitor/resources, it shows that 32% of CPU1 in CPU History and 100% of CPU2?
2008-03-15T08:19:00.000Z	stefano_	joanki	that is because you have a processor with two cores in it, ubuntu recognises them as two seperate cpus so your system will be even faster when multitasking :-)
2008-03-15T08:19:00.000Z	joanki	stefano_	but is it normal for 100% CPU history?
2008-03-15T08:20:00.000Z	stefano_	joanki	if you open up the program gnome-system-monitor (just press Alt+F2 and type it in), you can see all your running proccesses and sort them by cpu usage, so you can see what programms are really bugging your processor. if neccesarry you can kill them
2008-03-15T08:21:00.000Z	joanki	stefano_	it's all Virtualbox!
2008-03-15T08:22:00.000Z	stefano_	joanki	its a heavy program :)
