2005-08-06T10:20:00.000Z	ubuntu_		how can i send files to a pc runnin windows xp on my network
2005-08-06T10:20:00.000Z	bimberi	ubuntu_	set up a share on the xp box and try to connect to it from Places -> Network Servers on ubuntu
2005-08-06T10:30:00.000Z	bimberi	ubuntu_	could be a permissions thing
2005-12-08T16:43:00.000Z	bimberi	ubuntu_	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FirefoxNewVersion
2005-12-17T16:26:00.000Z	bimberi	ubuntu_	Applications -> Accessories -> Archive Manager
2005-12-17T16:29:00.000Z	bimberi	ubuntu_	mpg123 is in the multiverse repository (which you may have to enable - http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/AddingRepositoriesHowto)
2006-04-12T06:17:00.000Z	bimberi	ubuntu_	the installer can resize for you, but it is best to back up first :)
2006-05-11T15:58:00.000Z	bimberi	ubuntu_	i'd use it for that
2006-10-03T08:31:00.000Z	bimberi	ubuntu_	try hitting CTRL-C at that point
2006-10-03T08:31:00.000Z	ubuntu_	bimberi	- didn't work
2006-10-03T08:32:00.000Z	ubuntu_	bimberi	- looks like i can't get a console for f2-f7 either.
2006-10-03T08:32:00.000Z	bimberi	ubuntu_	hm, perhaps try it just as the "configuring..." message appears
2006-10-03T08:32:00.000Z	ubuntu_	bimberi	- nah, nothing.
2006-10-03T08:32:00.000Z	bimberi	ubuntu_	yes, it probably hasn't started them yet
2006-10-03T08:33:00.000Z	ubuntu_	bimberi	- What file controls wifi modules being started?
2006-10-03T08:34:00.000Z	bimberi	ubuntu_	idk sorry, if you know the module you can prevent it being loaded by blacklisting it in /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist
2006-10-03T08:37:00.000Z	bimberi	ubuntu_	another method would be to remove the /etc/rcS.d/S40networking symlink.  You might need a live cd as i think recovery mode will try to start it up too
2006-10-03T08:37:00.000Z	ubuntu_	bimberi	- bimberi - Great idea! - can you help me do it?
2006-10-03T08:40:00.000Z	ubuntu_	bimberi	- man unlink - says it will remove the file. - is that good?
2006-10-03T08:41:00.000Z	bimberi	ubuntu_	no you can just delete the link with 'rm'
2006-10-03T08:41:00.000Z	ubuntu_	bimberi	- What does it link to?
2006-10-03T08:42:00.000Z	bimberi	ubuntu_	/etc/rcS.d/S40networking: symbolic link to `../init.d/networking'
2006-10-03T08:43:00.000Z	ubuntu_	bimberi	- okay, I'll take a look there. - Thanks :)
2006-10-03T08:43:00.000Z	bimberi	ubuntu_	np, good luck :)
