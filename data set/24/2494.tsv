2008-12-16T03:37:00.000Z	outoftime		hi all - running ubuntu on a new thinkpad and it seems pretty clear that gnome is running in its basic video mode - how would i go about figuring out what driver to install to get the nice video (or if there is one available)? thanks and sorry for the noob question...
2008-12-16T03:37:00.000Z	Formode	outoftime	Intel, Nvidia, or ATI?
2008-12-16T03:38:00.000Z	outoftime	Formode	I believe it's intel - it's the onboard video
2008-12-16T03:38:00.000Z	Formode	outoftime	Try going Preferences -> Appearance
2008-12-16T03:39:00.000Z	Formode	outoftime	then go to the "Visual Effects" Tab
2008-12-16T03:39:00.000Z	outoftime	Formode	ah HA!
2008-12-16T03:39:00.000Z	Formode	outoftime	You could also go to add/remove.. and get the advanced compiz settings manager. :)
2008-12-16T03:39:00.000Z	outoftime	Formode	hmm, it searched for drivers and then said effects cannot be enabled. does that mean I'm SOL?
2008-12-16T03:40:00.000Z	Formode	outoftime	Hm. Do you know the card's name, or the amount of memory it has?
2008-12-16T03:40:00.000Z	outoftime	Formode	negative, although I should be able to figure that out, right? lshow?
2008-12-16T03:41:00.000Z	outoftime	Formode	thank you, I will check that out
2008-12-16T03:41:00.000Z	Formode	outoftime	I'm not sure. :) Never had that problem, I built my computer myself so. :-P Do you know what the computer model is? Or your Mobo name?
2008-12-16T03:41:00.000Z	outoftime	Formode	it's a Thinkpad SL300 - I think the graphics card is pretty bottom-of-the-barrel
2008-12-16T03:42:00.000Z	Formode	outoftime	try what raylu said. :)
2008-12-16T03:43:00.000Z	Formode	outoftime	Try going System -> Administration -> Hardware Drivers.
2008-12-16T03:44:00.000Z	outoftime	Formode	nothing in the list...
2008-12-16T03:45:00.000Z	Formode	outoftime	just doing some looking about, holy on. ^^
