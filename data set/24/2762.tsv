2008-08-27T23:50:00.000Z	JohnK	GrnFraggle	I might
2008-08-27T23:51:00.000Z	JohnK	GrnFraggle	it drove me crazy. have you installed j-pilot?
2008-08-27T23:51:00.000Z	GrnFraggle	JohnK	  yup, same behavior as gnome-pilot.
2008-08-27T23:53:00.000Z	JohnK	GrnFraggle	did you use install user in j-pilot?
2008-08-27T23:53:00.000Z	GrnFraggle	JohnK	it won't install
2008-08-27T23:53:00.000Z	GrnFraggle	JohnK	should i hit hotsync b4 i open jpilot?
2008-08-27T23:57:00.000Z	GrnFraggle	JohnK	it's not working.   both ways, palm connected when i open jpilot, and hitting hotsync after it requests hotsync.      should i have a special id number?
2008-08-28T00:01:00.000Z	GrnFraggle	JohnK	 Here's what i get from dmesg after jpilot fails
2008-08-28T00:03:00.000Z	JohnK	GrnFraggle	have you run sudo modprobe visor?
2008-08-28T00:04:00.000Z	GrnFraggle	JohnK	yes, i have visor loaded
2008-08-28T00:05:00.000Z	JohnK	GrnFraggle	have you read this page? http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=607540
2008-08-28T00:05:00.000Z	GrnFraggle	JohnK	yes i've read it
2008-08-28T00:06:00.000Z	JohnK	GrnFraggle	the post by eldiagolosk got me going
2008-08-28T00:07:00.000Z	JohnK	GrnFraggle	you are not alone with this problem, I wish that it was a outathebox run
2008-08-28T00:07:00.000Z	GrnFraggle	JohnK	i know.   i can't believe how many abandoned posts there are regarding failed palm sync.
2008-08-28T00:09:00.000Z	JohnK	GrnFraggle	Running modprobe visor and clicking on File--->Install within J-piolt is what got me running.
2008-08-28T00:09:00.000Z	GrnFraggle	JohnK	are you a bot?
2008-08-28T00:11:00.000Z	JohnK	GrnFraggle	what palm device is it?
2008-08-28T00:17:00.000Z	JohnK	GrnFraggle	Can you go to a computer where you have not tried a palm connection yet? If so try this:   1.install modprobe visor 2. Install j-pilot 3. run mode probe visor 4. start j-piolt. 5. clik on File ---> install 6. sync your Palm to the desktop and do a backup
2008-08-28T00:18:00.000Z	GrnFraggle	JohnK	this pilot works in windows.  i know it functions.  i cannot change computers with it, however i did boot this computer off LiveCD and tried exactly that.   still didn't work
2008-08-28T00:21:00.000Z	JohnK	GrnFraggle	Here is my e-mail address: jkerr0102@rogers.com let me know how you get on with it. This pisses me off. I love Ubuntu and Linux. But all of the talk about "Linux on the Desktop" is going nowhere until things like this work out of the box.
2008-08-28T00:23:00.000Z	JohnK	GrnFraggle	what is your timeline here to get this running?
2008-08-28T00:26:00.000Z	JohnK	GrnFraggle	two choices 1. try mandriva but check the forums to see if it is a problem there as well 2. Pay Canonical for support.
