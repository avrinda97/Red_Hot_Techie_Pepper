2009-05-09T04:02:00.000Z	Gnea	bamb00	just don't type lots of short sentences and then hit enter a lot :)
2009-05-09T04:02:00.000Z	Gnea	bamb00	depending on what you want to do with linux... these days, you really don't
2009-05-09T04:03:00.000Z	Gnea	bamb00	ubuntu works with any internet connection.
2009-05-09T04:03:00.000Z	Gnea	bamb00	dsl, cable, wireless, dialup, x.25....
2009-05-09T04:04:00.000Z	Gnea	bamb00	this is 2009. that was 2002. tell me, could you play games with linux in 1994 with full 3d graphics? :)
2009-05-09T04:05:00.000Z	Gnea	bamb00	staroffice is old and obsolete. we use openoffice now (sun open-sourced staroffice and openoffice was the result - it's still in development with regular stable releases)
2009-05-09T04:06:00.000Z	Gnea	bamb00	and ignore the bots
2009-05-09T04:07:00.000Z	Gnea	bamb00	have you been living under a rock that broke a mirror?
2009-05-09T04:07:00.000Z	Gnea	bamb00	well, you mentioned you hadn't used linux for about 7 years
2009-05-09T04:08:00.000Z	bamb00	Gnea	i tried linux in 2002 a lot bt it didnt work with anything not with internet also fonts were ugly etc. so i gave up after that windows XP was gr8 so i didnt bother now vista is like super SUCK and i dont want to waste laptop energy on stupid vista thats why i want linux or xp but  u cant get xp drivers so linux
2009-05-09T04:10:00.000Z	Gnea	bamb00	ah, okay. well, here's the deal: mandrake (which is now called mandriva) is one out of, literally, hundreds of distributions. Ubuntu is based off of the Debian GNU/Linux distribution, which is well known for its stableness.  It is not Debian, but uses the same package management system and a few other minor tidbits (configuration locations, etc)
2009-05-09T04:12:00.000Z	Gnea	bamb00	Ubuntu has been made, from the ground-up, to be easy for anybody to use.  Most of everything has been setup and geared toward desktop use.  If something isn't working, there's over 1,000 people here in #ubuntu.  Plus, we also have http://ubuntuforums.org, which you are encouraged to register on.  Sometimes asking questions in both forums can get your answers quicker. :)
2009-05-09T04:12:00.000Z	Gnea	bamb00	of course, there's a server version as well, and as of last month, there's a version for netbooks too.
2009-05-09T04:13:00.000Z	Gnea	bamb00	of course you'll be a n00b, but you know what?  everyone's a n00b at some point.  if you can get past that and not get all upset over it and accept it, you won't be a noob for very long and everyone will forget it :)
2009-05-09T04:15:00.000Z	Gnea	bamb00	we also don't encourage nor condone racial/religios/any kind of disrespect or bigotry toward anyone else.
2009-05-09T04:16:00.000Z	Gnea	bamb00	if, for whatever reason, you feel that calling someone names and making a complete arse out of yourself is better than showing respect, then there are moderators who will kindly show you where you can stick such comments.
2009-05-09T04:17:00.000Z	Gnea	bamb00	so, what is it that you're having issues with Ubuntu today? :)
