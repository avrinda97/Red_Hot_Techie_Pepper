2008-05-17T05:21:00.000Z	m0u5e		anyone knwo where gnome houses its mime extensions and the associated programs?, that alone would help me alot
2008-05-17T05:22:00.000Z	ifireball	m0u5e	right click on any file, and you can change the association
2008-05-17T05:28:00.000Z	m0u5e	ifireball	thats the problem i'm having now, the properties window won't create for anything with a *.mkv extension, thats why I am asking how to manually reset it (where can I manually edit the mimes)
2008-05-17T05:30:00.000Z	ifireball	m0u5e	that's weird... well do some digging in the hidden .gnome and .gnome2 directories in your home folder, it should be in there somewhere, probably stored as a bunch of *.desktop files
2008-05-17T05:31:00.000Z	m0u5e	ifireball	i did, i deleted a few files hoping it would reset, but nothing has changed
2008-05-17T05:32:00.000Z	ifireball	m0u5e	you need logout and log back in or at least force-restart nautilus for such changes to take affect
2008-05-17T05:32:00.000Z	m0u5e	ifireball	I've done all that
2008-05-17T05:33:00.000Z	ifireball	m0u5e	well, its actually the 1st time I've heard of nautilus not showing property windows at all, what happens exactly? the option doesn't show up on the menu?
2008-05-17T05:34:00.000Z	m0u5e	ifireball	it does, but it just stays at "generating properties window" and stops
2008-05-17T05:35:00.000Z	ifireball	m0u5e	weird indeed, well, do the blank user test, e.g. create a new user account and log in to it and see if its got the problem as well, to figure out weather its a global system problem or just with your account
2008-05-17T05:36:00.000Z	m0u5e	ifireball	okay will try that thx
2008-05-17T05:44:00.000Z	m0u5e	ifireball	okay its systemwide, i created a new account called test, and yeah it still doesn't work for *.mkv files
2008-05-17T05:45:00.000Z	m0u5e	ifireball	how would i check nautilus error logs? (where are they stored again? xD
2008-05-17T05:46:00.000Z	ifireball	m0u5e	I don;t know of any nautilus-specific logs, but there might be something helpful in your ~/.xsession-errors file
2008-05-17T05:47:00.000Z	m0u5e	ifireball	i just cat .xsession-errors and nothing with mkv came up
2008-05-17T05:48:00.000Z	ifireball	m0u5e	I suggest you start backtracking and uninstalling "weird" packages that may have to do with MKV, seems on of them may cause nautilus to try and do something too complex when displaying the properties window
2008-05-17T05:48:00.000Z	m0u5e	ifireball	whats weird is that it doesn't eat up cpu cycles, it just does nothing... like the properties windows for mkv doesnt even exist
2008-05-17T05:48:00.000Z	ifireball	m0u5e	nobody ever said its gonna be that easy...
2008-05-17T05:48:00.000Z	m0u5e	ifireball	thx i appreciate your help though xD
2008-05-17T05:48:00.000Z	m0u5e	ifireball	i'm checking in /var/logs now
2008-05-17T05:49:00.000Z	m0u5e	ifireball	i think this problem started happening after a fsck was run / and it was around the time i installed a new gstreamer plugin
2008-05-17T05:50:00.000Z	ifireball	m0u5e	well maybe the nautilus-thumbnailer is chocking on the plugin or something
2008-05-17T05:50:00.000Z	m0u5e	ifireball	thats a possibility, my .mkv files don't seem to be displaying correctly... ill give that a try thx
