2005-11-02T13:00:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Mea_Culpa	ive heard yes but im not real sure about htat
2005-11-02T13:01:00.000Z	Mea_Culpa	gnomefreak	That's why I ask. Because Ubuntu people say they have more but Debian people say they have more....
2005-11-02T13:01:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Mea_Culpa	if im not mistaken you can use ubuntu sources in most if not all debian based distros
2005-11-02T13:10:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Mea_Culpa	i have no sound issues but im not using a mac either :(
2005-11-02T13:11:00.000Z	Mea_Culpa	gnomefreak	My x86 PC also had perfect sound on the live cd.
2005-11-02T13:11:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Mea_Culpa	it could be the drivers for your sound card
2005-11-02T13:11:00.000Z	Mea_Culpa	gnomefreak	yeah but I can't change that
2005-11-02T13:12:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Mea_Culpa	 there used to be a site im sure its still out there for drivers for ubuntu/linux to see if they are usable but i cant think of site
2005-11-02T13:13:00.000Z	Mea_Culpa	gnomefreak	It's not Ubuntu specific (i'm on gentoo now and have the same problem)
2005-11-02T13:13:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Mea_Culpa	 i try not to force anything if i have a choise
2005-11-02T13:13:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Mea_Culpa	 i know the feeling i did the same thing with grub
