2005-10-27T05:01:00.000Z	gimmulf	Jowi	 what command should i use?
2005-10-27T05:02:00.000Z	Jowi	gimmulf	i'm trying to remember where i got unrar from. was before i updated to breezy.
2005-10-27T05:35:00.000Z	Jowi	gimmulf	if unrar doesn't do it for you i have no idea what can.
2005-10-27T05:35:00.000Z	gimmulf	Jowi	 isnt the command for extracting just: unrar-free -x file.rar?
2005-10-27T05:35:00.000Z	Jowi	gimmulf	no. "unrar x filename.rar"
