2010-08-07T21:24:00.000Z	hsa2		why ubuntu is using pulseaudio while it's not working allright with flash? my flash sounds are not in sync, and i can't find any solution!
2010-08-07T21:25:00.000Z	wombatguy	hsa2	are you on ubuntu 10.04
2010-08-07T21:25:00.000Z	hsa2	wombatguy	yes, and my system is fully up-to-date
2010-08-07T21:26:00.000Z	hsa2		and i know it's not a hardware issue, i tried it on a second machine and pulseaudio still fails on it
2010-08-07T21:26:00.000Z	wombatguy		and you have checked the flash file on another system where it works as you'd expect or have you checked multiple systems
2010-08-07T21:27:00.000Z	wombatguy		i haven't had an issue with pulseaudio here for some time though i did have to do something back in 8.10 or something might have been 9.10
2010-08-07T21:27:00.000Z	hsa2	wombatguy	multiple systems and multiple flash files
2010-08-07T21:27:00.000Z	wombatguy		you are also using the most current flash player correct?
2010-08-07T21:27:00.000Z	hsa2	wombatguy	yes
2010-08-07T21:27:00.000Z	hsa2	wombatguy	when you hit pause on youtube, doesn't sound still play for half a sec?
2010-08-07T21:29:00.000Z	hsa2	wombatguy	?
2010-08-07T21:29:00.000Z	wombatguy		https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PulseAudio <- i had to do this libflashsupport thing some time ago but not sure what it would help now
2010-08-07T21:29:00.000Z	wombatguy		my system was just upgraded from there to here though eventually i will do a fresh install again
2010-08-07T21:30:00.000Z	hsa2	wombatguy	i'll check now, if it works, i'll sudo make you a sandwich
2010-08-07T21:31:00.000Z	wombatguy		youtube stops somewhat abruptly and theres something but it's not out of sync or anything
2010-08-07T21:32:00.000Z	wombatguy		a link
2010-08-07T21:32:00.000Z	hsa2	wombatguy	can you also test gamezer.com please, click on links and see if sound comes as quick as you click
2010-08-07T21:34:00.000Z	wombatguy	hsa2	do i need to register?
2010-08-07T21:35:00.000Z	hsa2	wombatguy	nope, http://www.gamezer.com/billiards/ and try to login with a blank input
2010-08-07T21:35:00.000Z	hsa2		when you hit login button, a ding sounds
