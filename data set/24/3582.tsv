2008-03-14T23:19:00.000Z	RoCUnreal	jimcooncat	yea
2008-03-14T23:19:00.000Z	RoCUnreal	jimcooncat	its  a .msi file tho
2008-03-14T23:19:00.000Z	RoCUnreal	jimcooncat	it gives me that error http://pastebin.com/m4e0212f4 when i try an run it
2008-03-14T23:20:00.000Z	jimcooncat	RoCUnreal	that's really pushing the limits on what you could hope Wine can do. You should be looking at Virtualbox if it can handle the graphics, or Blender if you're not tied to Maya.
2008-03-14T23:22:00.000Z	RoCUnreal	jimcooncat	Virtualbox? is it hard to setup?
2008-03-14T23:23:00.000Z	jimcooncat	RoCUnreal	No, as long as you have a Windows CD handy. I'm guessing you have a fairly modern machine with 1 GB or more of RAM.
2008-03-14T23:24:00.000Z	RoCUnreal	jimcooncat	yea i have my windows XP cd
2008-03-14T23:24:00.000Z	RoCUnreal	jimcooncat	2GB DDR2 800
2008-03-14T23:24:00.000Z	RoCUnreal	jimcooncat	4ghz CPU
2008-03-14T23:24:00.000Z	RoCUnreal	jimcooncat	any links to the best virtual box?
2008-03-14T23:25:00.000Z	jimcooncat	RoCUnreal	I believe it's available with apt-get, let me check if there's any tips.
2008-03-14T23:26:00.000Z	jimcooncat		!virtualbox | RoCUnreal
2008-03-14T23:29:00.000Z	jimcooncat	RoCUnreal	I've been using the free edition for a couple months now with good results. You'll probably want to d/l the user manual too, at http://195.34.175.98/download/UserManual.pdf
