2011-08-24T13:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jayz	select the text and press CTRL+C
2011-08-24T13:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jayz	in duckduckgo (and probably google) search for: natty java    works well
2011-08-24T14:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jayz	sup? (BTW, drop the @ it makes highlighting not work, also use TAB to complete nicks)

2011-08-24T14:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jayz	makes sense

2011-08-24T14:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jayz	hibernate was disabled in Maverick for that model. I suggest you log a bug

2011-08-24T14:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jayz	this may help, i've not tried it but should be reversible http://thecodecentral.com/2011/01/18/fix-ubuntu-10-10-suspendhibernate-not-working-bug
2011-08-24T14:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jayz	i'm not great with bluetooth, not something I use
2011-08-24T14:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jayz	if you reboot then run:  dmesg | less    you can see the devices being detected and see if the device is detected
