2012-10-27T21:22:00.000Z	moondoggy		Anyone know how to get the gcc math libraries working on a new installation of 12.04?
2012-10-27T21:22:00.000Z	moondoggy		I can't even get sqrt to work.
2012-10-27T21:22:00.000Z	trism	moondoggy	gcc test.c -lm; thought might help to give a bit more details
2012-10-27T21:23:00.000Z	moondoggy		I can paste a line...
2012-10-27T21:23:00.000Z	moondoggy		/tmp/ccGgpkmz.o: In function `dEdX':
2012-10-27T21:23:00.000Z	moondoggy		elast.c:(.text+0x17ec): undefined reference to `sqrt'
2012-10-27T21:24:00.000Z	trism	moondoggy	yes I figured the output, the line you used to compile would be more useful, though as long as you specify -lm at the end you should be okay
2012-10-27T21:24:00.000Z	moondoggy		In 10.04, it found the math libraries.  With the same gcc ... -lm... I get those errors.
2012-10-27T21:24:00.000Z	trism	moondoggy	position matters
2012-10-27T21:24:00.000Z	trism	moondoggy	it has to come after the source files that reference it
2012-10-27T21:25:00.000Z	moondoggy		I'm doing gcc -lm -o elast elast.c
2012-10-27T21:25:00.000Z	moondoggy		I should move -lm to the end?
2012-10-27T21:25:00.000Z	trism	moondoggy	yes that is incorrect
2012-10-27T21:25:00.000Z	trism	moondoggy	yes, gcc -o elast elast.c -lm
2012-10-27T21:26:00.000Z	moondoggy		Huh!  Never complained on any other linux.
2012-10-27T21:26:00.000Z	moondoggy		Got lucky, I guess.
2012-10-27T21:26:00.000Z	trism	moondoggy	it used to work before 11.10, but mostly by accident, the linker would once link implicitly with all libraries passed it, now it only links if the symbols are referenced
2012-10-27T21:27:00.000Z	trism	moondoggy	and it searched for symbols left to right on the commandline
2012-10-27T21:27:00.000Z	moondoggy		Su'm'gun.  Thanks, trism.
2012-10-27T21:27:00.000Z	moondoggy		Funny--the guy who made up this install script is a good programmer, so I was sure it was my new 12.04.
2012-10-27T21:28:00.000Z	moondoggy		Thanks for the help, friends, before I started ripping my computer apart.
2012-10-27T21:28:00.000Z	trism	moondoggy	it isn't really surprising, many many projects had to be fixed (and we are still finding broken ones)
2012-10-27T21:29:00.000Z	moondoggy	trism	Well, thanks!  Anything I can help YOU with?  :)
2012-10-27T21:29:00.000Z	trism	moondoggy	no I'm alright, thanks though
