2009-06-29T02:53:00.000Z	bitf		help anyone?
2009-06-29T02:54:00.000Z	cbhl	bitf	have you tried running in Gnome Failsafe mode?
2009-06-29T02:54:00.000Z	bitf	cbhl	I ran recovery mode, how do I run GNOME failsafe?
2009-06-29T02:55:00.000Z	cbhl	bitf	do you get a login screen when you start up "normally"?
2009-06-29T02:57:00.000Z	cbhl	bitf	at the log in screen, select "Session" (or "Options" and then "Session") and usually you will see an option for Gnome Failsafe
2009-06-29T03:02:00.000Z	bitf	cbhl	with failsafe GNOME it fails to improve
2009-06-29T03:05:00.000Z	cbhl	bitf	how did you enable compiz, anyway?
2009-06-29T03:06:00.000Z	bitf	cbhl	downloaded Compiz config
2009-06-29T03:06:00.000Z	cbhl	bitf	... where and how did you download it, and what version of ubuntu are you running?
2009-06-29T03:07:00.000Z	bitf	cbhl	synaptic, 9.04
2009-06-29T03:11:00.000Z	cbhl	bitf	what graphics card do you have?
2009-06-29T03:17:00.000Z	bitf	cbhl	no idea, but things now only go black when you mouse over them
2009-06-29T03:20:00.000Z	bitf	cbhl	would the best option be to reset with the live cd?
2009-06-29T03:23:00.000Z	cbhl	bitf	it might not be the best, but it will likely be the most straightforward
2009-06-29T03:24:00.000Z	cbhl	bitf	the only other idea that might be worth a shot, is if you can get to a command line...
2009-06-29T03:24:00.000Z	cbhl	bitf	might be to try temporarily moving your home folder somewhere else
2009-06-29T03:31:00.000Z	cbhl	bitf	sorry, I missed your last message
2009-06-29T03:31:00.000Z	cbhl	bitf	I know this sounds strange, but do you know how to use command line?
2009-06-29T03:32:00.000Z	bitf	cbhl	 sort of, depends on what I need to do
2009-06-29T03:33:00.000Z	cbhl	bitf	hmm... this looks a lot like your situation; did you try the instructions at http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1067851 ?
2009-06-29T03:38:00.000Z	bitf	cbhl	got rid of compiz, going to try reinstalling it.
2009-06-29T03:40:00.000Z	cbhl	bitf	okay, let me know how it goes
2009-06-29T03:45:00.000Z	bitf	cbhl	it works, thanks for your help
2009-06-29T03:45:00.000Z	cbhl	bitf	that's good to hear; glad I could help
