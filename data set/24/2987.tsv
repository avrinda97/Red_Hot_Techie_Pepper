2008-06-05T07:21:00.000Z	MindVirus		What exactly is the "netbook remix"?
2008-06-05T07:23:00.000Z	amrik	MindVirus	i think its a version of Ubuntu designed for the new class of of computers, netbooks eg. eeepc
2008-06-05T07:24:00.000Z	MindVirus	amrik	do you know how to get that sweet panel where it looks like the currently selected program in the taskbar is a tab?
2008-06-05T07:24:00.000Z	amrik	MindVirus	no but I am very much interested in the answer to your question. do you have any clues?
2008-06-05T07:25:00.000Z	MindVirus	amrik	I have a picture.
2008-06-05T07:27:00.000Z	amrik	MindVirus	woah that looks pretty sweet. is that supposed to replace the taskbar at the bottom?
2008-06-05T07:28:00.000Z	MindVirus	amrik	the article talks about some sort of "Maximus".

2008-06-05T07:30:00.000Z	amrik	MindVirus	got the link. is there a package available? this thing looks amazing for my laptop
2008-06-05T07:31:00.000Z	MindVirus	amrik	it says it needs some bug fixing before it's ready - there's a screen name with the GIMP - http://media.arstechnica.com/news.media/451/remixgimp.png
2008-06-05T07:31:00.000Z	MindVirus	amrik	I'm willing to beta test though.
2008-06-05T07:31:00.000Z	MindVirus	amrik	I am looking for a package.
2008-06-05T07:41:00.000Z	amrik	MindVirus	dpkg-buildpackage? its been a while since i've done this
2008-06-05T07:36:00.000Z	amrik	MindVirus	apparently the source is available for it, but i dont think its been packaged up as yet?
2008-06-05T07:37:00.000Z	MindVirus	amrik	:(
2008-06-05T07:37:00.000Z	amrik	MindVirus	https://launchpad.net/netbook-remix
2008-06-05T07:38:00.000Z	MindVirus	amrik	good call.
2008-06-05T07:38:00.000Z	amrik	MindVirus	can you try it out and tell me how it is? i kind of want to use this on my laptop now
2008-06-05T07:39:00.000Z	MindVirus	amrik	this computer cannot shut down.
2008-06-05T07:39:00.000Z	MindVirus	amrik	plus, I'm kinda scared of installing from source.
2008-06-05T07:39:00.000Z	amrik	MindVirus	if you build it as a package you should be fine
2008-06-05T07:40:00.000Z	MindVirus	amrik	how would I do that?
2008-06-05T07:42:00.000Z	MindVirus	amrik	nope.
2008-06-05T07:47:00.000Z	amrik	MindVirus	i think i found some instructions that can help
