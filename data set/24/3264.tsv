2009-06-22T00:33:00.000Z	pisecx		Hi. I have changed a password with "passwd". Now each time when I login network manager asking my old password to connect to wifi. It doesn't ask me wifi password. It asks me my old account password.
2009-06-22T00:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	pisecx	 applications -> acessories -> passwords & encryption keys.
2009-06-22T00:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	pisecx	 you can change it there.. (or remove it if you dont want it to ask)
2009-06-22T00:34:00.000Z	pisecx	Dr_Willis	I deleted my wifi password there, but it didn't help
2009-06-22T00:35:00.000Z	pisecx	Dr_Willis	seems like I have to delete some password that belong directly to network manager
2009-06-22T00:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	pisecx	 yes... see --> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=7470795
2009-06-22T00:35:00.000Z	pisecx	Dr_Willis	what happed: I deleted password for wifi, reloggined. It asked my wifi password, and then tried to save it
2009-06-22T00:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	pisecx	 i set mine where it dont even ask now. :)
2009-06-22T00:36:00.000Z	pisecx	Dr_Willis	did you change account password? that is the problem: I've changed it. It didn't ask my before
2009-06-22T00:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	pisecx	 i used to have both passwords be the same.
2009-06-22T00:36:00.000Z	pisecx	Dr_Willis	let me read the thread
2009-06-22T00:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	pisecx	 its s short thread. :)
2009-06-22T00:37:00.000Z	pisecx	Dr_Willis	I think, I understand now
2009-06-22T00:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	pisecx	 for step 4 --> Enter current password and *change it how you like*
2009-06-22T00:39:00.000Z	pisecx	Dr_Willis	you're a real doctor! =)
2009-06-22T00:39:00.000Z	pisecx	Dr_Willis	thanks a lot
2009-06-22T00:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	pisecx	 asking how to disable that login thing gets asked a lot in htere.. so i researched it and found how trivial it was. :)
2009-06-22T00:40:00.000Z	pisecx	Dr_Willis	I think the problem is that is't not very clear that you have to change password for the _group_
2009-06-22T00:41:00.000Z	pisecx	Dr_Willis	because "login" is kind of group
2009-06-22T00:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	pisecx	 yea.. too many passwords for too many things.
2009-06-22T00:44:00.000Z	pisecx	Dr_Willis	I think, it'a bug. Ubuntu should change login password.
2009-06-22T00:47:00.000Z	pisecx	Dr_Willis	can I ask you one more question? It's about pgp. My friend has created pgp key and sent it to my. I have imported it and trusted. So it is in trusted group now. Then he created a file, encrypted it and sent me via email. I have received it, saved and tried to decrypt. But it failed. It even didn't asked me for a password.
2009-06-22T00:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	pisecx	 ive not messed with pgp enough to have ever even done that.
2009-06-22T00:47:00.000Z	pisecx	Dr_Willis	never mind, I'll google it :) thank and bye
