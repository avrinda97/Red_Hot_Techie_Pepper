2009-03-18T07:53:00.000Z	kc8pxy		i need some help rescuing my ubuntu desktop..     it keeps freezing during boot. it will act like it's about to go to the login manager,   and then die, black-screen, most of the time...    other times, i'll get a stalled "working cursor, but still no login,  and other times, it's fine.
2009-03-18T07:53:00.000Z	Ndshacker	kc8pxy	Just walk away for a bit
2009-03-18T07:53:00.000Z	kc8pxy		the gentoo it's dual-booted with boots fine every time.

2009-03-18T07:55:00.000Z	Ndshacker		kc8: do you get any probs in the recovery console?
2009-03-18T07:56:00.000Z	kc8pxy	Ndshacker	 what tweaks?  I've not tried recovery console much yet. it's our font-desk computer. I'm not at the shop.
2009-03-18T07:57:00.000Z	Ndshacker	kc8pxy	Mine had a problem with the network card, so... its probably a hardwar malfunction causing it
2009-03-18T07:57:00.000Z	Ndshacker		I had to blacklist a few processes to fix it
2009-03-18T07:57:00.000Z	kc8pxy	Ndshacker	 like???   i need to appease the ubuntu people at the shop.
2009-03-18T07:57:00.000Z	Ndshacker		lolz
2009-03-18T07:58:00.000Z	Ndshacker		What is it running on?
2009-03-18T07:58:00.000Z	kc8pxy	Ndshacker	.........  i forget the board, but it's an amd64 3200+ with s 200 gb sata, and 1gb ram
2009-03-18T07:58:00.000Z	Ndshacker		onboard networking controller?
2009-03-18T07:59:00.000Z	kc8pxy	Ndshacker	 yes.
2009-03-18T07:59:00.000Z	Ndshacker		Bah

2009-03-18T08:01:00.000Z	Ndshacker		Thank god for linux, it just helped me get a windows driver O.O
2009-03-18T08:02:00.000Z	Ndshacker		For what?
2009-03-18T08:02:00.000Z	Ndshacker		there are lots of terminal commands
2009-03-18T08:05:00.000Z	kc8pxy	Ndshacker	 what bothers me, is that it was working fine, then someone killed the power while it was on,  and it's been flaky under ubuntu ever since,  but i CANNOT get teh same flakiness out of the gentoo that's also on the same box.
