2008-10-24T15:32:00.000Z	garu		hi everyone
2008-10-24T15:33:00.000Z	garu		having problems with ubuntu 8.04 LTS.When I connect a usb device, nothing happens, until last week everything was fine, but, now, just like that, it stopped working, even my pen drive doesnt work.can someone help?
2008-10-24T15:35:00.000Z	jim_p	garu	do you have a flash drive handy? remove it from the pc, open a terminal, plug it in, and write in the terminal dmesg | tail   . what does it say?
2008-10-24T15:37:00.000Z	garu	jim_p	it says "[175.420657] hub 3-0:1.0: Cannot enable port 3. Maybe the usb cable is bad?"
2008-10-24T15:38:00.000Z	jim_p	garu	:O maybe yes. connect it on some port on the back thats directly connected on the mobo and do the procedure again
2008-10-24T15:43:00.000Z	garu	jim_p	same error in every single port.front and back.It says first "hub_port_status failed" and then it says "port 1 reset error"!
2008-10-24T15:44:00.000Z	jim_p	garu	it may be some kernel malfunction. try another kernel or a live cd
2008-10-24T15:45:00.000Z	garu	jim_p	the problem is, that, it happens with winXP as well...I got dual boot, but with xp is a really serious problem.as soon as I plug in the flash drive or anything else, it completely freezes the system until I hard reboot.lol
2008-10-24T15:46:00.000Z	jim_p	garu	what psu are you on?
2008-10-24T15:46:00.000Z	jim_p	garu	you are next to a big hardware failure!
2008-10-24T15:46:00.000Z	garu	jim_p	never had a single lovely blue screen of death.lol
2008-10-24T15:47:00.000Z	jim_p	garu	what psu are you on?
2008-10-24T15:47:00.000Z	garu	jim_p	it just happened like that, from one week to another.the only thing I changed on the system was, that I started working with virtual machines
2008-10-24T15:47:00.000Z	garu	jim_p	psu ?????? :s

2008-10-24T15:55:00.000Z	jim_p	garu	then somehow your usb ports may got damaged
2008-10-24T15:55:00.000Z	garu	jim_p	dont even use the battery anymore...this computer has a relly crappy battery life (packard bell) :o
