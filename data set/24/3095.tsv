2008-05-03T01:17:00.000Z	jasperarcher		Hello, I just installed 8.04 on my laptop (no other OS installed).  I had some pictures and other files backed up on a USB stick, I tried to drag them onto my “documents” folder, but it says I don't have enough space – only 5 MB left free on that drive.  Did I do the partitions incorrectly?  I'm sure its a total newb question but any help would be much appreciated.
2008-05-03T01:19:00.000Z	guest	jasperarcher	go to System > Administration > System monitor, then click on the File Systems tab to check how much space you have left
2008-05-03T01:23:00.000Z	jasperarcher	guest	thank you.  here is what i get.  device gvfs-fuse-daemon ... /home/ubuntu/.gvfs total=251.5 MB free=30MB (88% used) ... but I have an 80 gig hard drive! :)  in System - Administration - Partition Editor, there is a /dev/sda1/ "filesystem - ext3" and that is marked as "boot" in Gparted
2008-05-03T01:25:00.000Z	guest	jasperarcher	does it say (in Gparted) how big the ext3 partition is?
2008-05-03T01:26:00.000Z	jasperarcher	guest	thank you.  yes.  ext3 reads 73.09 GiB, 2.64 Used. 70.45 unused, flagged as "boot"
2008-05-03T01:28:00.000Z	guest	jasperarcher	have you tried the "disk usage analyzer" to see what, if anything, is taking up all that space?
2008-05-03T01:29:00.000Z	jasperarcher	guest	thank you.  i have not tried that.  will load it up presently.  seems strange that GParted reports ext3 with 70 GiB free, but "System Monitor" does not list it?
2008-05-03T01:31:00.000Z	jasperarcher	guest	when I "Scan Filesystem" in "Disk Usage Analyzer", it says my total filesystem capacity is 2.1 GiB and 1 GiB free... weird?!
2008-05-03T01:33:00.000Z	guest	jasperarcher	that is weird, open a terminal and run the command "df -h" see if that outputs anything useful
2008-05-03T01:34:00.000Z	jasperarcher	guest	sorry got kicked off for a second
2008-05-03T01:35:00.000Z	guest	jasperarcher	its alright, did you get the message i sent you about "df -h" ?
2008-05-03T01:35:00.000Z	jasperarcher	guest	i am still here, i ran df -h, it gave me 9 lines
2008-05-03T01:36:00.000Z	jasperarcher	guest	tmpfs, 252M 16M used mounted on /lib/modeules/2.6.24-16-generic/volatile
2008-05-03T01:36:00.000Z	jasperarcher	guest	it says the same thing for the second line
2008-05-03T01:37:00.000Z	guest	jasperarcher	is there anything that says "/dev/sd" ?
2008-05-03T01:38:00.000Z	jasperarcher	guest	there is a /dev/sdc1 1.9 GiB, 1GiB free, I think this is the pen drive with my pictures and documents on it... I should also say that so far I have always had to boot via a (different) pen drive, since I couldn't install from CD (physical damage to CD-ROM)
2008-05-03T01:42:00.000Z	guest	jasperarcher	 so when you installed it you booted it from a pen drive?
2008-05-03T01:43:00.000Z	jasperarcher	guest	yes, since my CD-ROM doesn't work I put the install files on the USB and followed the instructions on pendrivelinux.com, i did not want to have to boot from a pen drive each time.  However, when I set my BIOS to boot from my internal HD first, it hangs on a black screen with "GRUB _"
2008-05-03T01:44:00.000Z	jasperarcher	guest	the only way for me to boot is to have the pen drive, and in the pen drive menu, i choose "boot from hard drive" .. and then it works.  its kind of annoying, and i would like to skip this extra step
2008-05-03T01:45:00.000Z	guest	jasperarcher	i'm thinking you're running from the pen drive and not an actual install on your hard drive. i'm afraid i dont know how to help you out with that problem
2008-05-03T01:47:00.000Z	jasperarcher	guest	i don't have any documents or files that i really need on here (only been a few days now), maybe I should just try a fresh install?
2008-05-03T01:48:00.000Z	guest	jasperarcher	that would probably the easiest fix
2008-05-03T01:48:00.000Z	jasperarcher	guest	off to try that now, thank you for your help and patience today
2008-05-03T01:48:00.000Z	guest	jasperarcher	you're welcome
