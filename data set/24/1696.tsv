2009-10-01T13:33:00.000Z	godstar	miron721	if you already have it installed on your SSD, disregard.
2009-10-01T13:34:00.000Z	miron721	godstar	Not using ssds, if that makes a difference.
2009-10-01T13:38:00.000Z	godstar	miron721	are you trying to install Ubuntu on your netbook?
2009-10-01T13:38:00.000Z	miron721	godstar	No, got ubuntu nbr running fine. I'm trying to install on my desktop
2009-10-01T13:40:00.000Z	godstar	miron721	1 HDD or 2?
2009-10-01T13:41:00.000Z	godstar	miron721	where are you having trouble during the install?
2009-10-01T13:42:00.000Z	miron721	godstar	install went perfectly. No errors. And it's 2 sata hdds, 1 sata optical drive
2009-10-01T13:42:00.000Z	godstar	miron721	then what is the problem?
2009-10-01T13:43:00.000Z	miron721	godstar	it doesn't boot. Without the cd in, I select ubuntu in the grub, and it sticks at a flashing "_". Longest I've left it is 4 hours.
2009-10-01T13:44:00.000Z	godstar	miron721	do you have anything on the separate HDD? If not reload Ubuntu on it. You could also put gparted on a flash drive reformation the HDD that wont boot.
2009-10-01T13:46:00.000Z	godstar	miron721	you can run your live cd and install gparted from add/remove. Keep in mind that any added apps you run in your live cd will be thrown into ram. Once you have gparted installed, you can reformat the HDD in question.
2009-10-01T13:46:00.000Z	miron721	godstar	Do I have to reformat the entire disk? I've got a bunch of stuff I don't want to lose, and no external drives
2009-10-01T13:47:00.000Z	godstar	miron721	you can copy your files over using the Live Cd. You will need to try to mount your HDD in question while in the live cd session.
2009-10-01T13:50:00.000Z	godstar	miron721	can you even access recovery console (hitting ESC) key during grub boot?
2009-10-01T13:50:00.000Z	miron721	godstar	I'll reboot and try.
2009-10-01T13:50:00.000Z	godstar	miron721	copy your files over in the live session and reload Ubuntu. May save you time.
2009-10-01T13:51:00.000Z	godstar	miron721	if you can reach recovery console w the ESC key, drop to root shell with networking and run apt-get update.
2009-10-01T13:52:00.000Z	miron721	godstar	Does the same thing. Flashing _
2009-10-01T14:55:00.000Z	godstar	miron721	did you back up your data?
2009-10-01T14:55:00.000Z	miron721	godstar	Can't. Too much info. Trying again on the same partition
2009-10-01T14:57:00.000Z	godstar	miron721	if you have a separate HDD (such as a 3rd one) you may want to consider installing Ubuntu on it, so you can back up your HDDs accordingly then format away and do another install on the drive of choice.
2009-10-01T14:58:00.000Z	godstar	miron721	let us know how it turns out.
