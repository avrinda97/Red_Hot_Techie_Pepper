2006-04-03T14:51:00.000Z	stocksy		lsilZha: i think tty4 give you some more info about what is happening
2006-04-03T14:53:00.000Z	stocksy		lsilZha: I dunno - I'm a relative noob ;)
2006-04-03T14:53:00.000Z	stocksy		i know jsut enough to screw things up *properly*
2006-04-03T14:53:00.000Z	IsilZha	stocksy	he asks for some input continuesly. how would i provide him with the input he wants?
2006-04-03T14:54:00.000Z	stocksy		lsilZha: what is it asking for?
2006-04-03T14:55:00.000Z	IsilZha	stocksy	it asks me to either say yes or no
2006-04-03T14:55:00.000Z	stocksy		lsilZha: is it apt asking if you want to continue installing packages?
2006-04-03T14:56:00.000Z	IsilZha	stocksy	yes
2006-04-03T14:56:00.000Z	stocksy		lsilZha: then make it happy, say 'yes'
2006-04-03T14:57:00.000Z	IsilZha	stocksy	how? in tty1? or 4? i tried both already...
2006-04-03T14:58:00.000Z	stocksy		lsilZha: ah, tty4 isn't accepting input from the keyboard?
2006-04-03T14:58:00.000Z	IsilZha	stocksy	no it's just littering my hd with posting this question twice a second...
2006-04-03T14:59:00.000Z	stocksy		lsilZha: sorry, but I've not seen that before
2006-04-03T14:59:00.000Z	stocksy		does anyone else know?
2006-04-03T14:59:00.000Z	IsilZha	stocksy	my remaining space reaches 1 gb... is there a way to clear up what was wrote to tty4 so far?
2006-04-03T15:00:00.000Z	stocksy		lsilZha: sorry dude, I don't know
2006-04-03T15:01:00.000Z	IsilZha		anybody got an idea? i'm running short of time....
2006-04-03T15:03:00.000Z	stocksy		lsilZha: in the absence of other ideas, maybe just terminate the install and restart it?
2006-04-03T15:05:00.000Z	IsilZha	stocksy	the problem is that he runs this automatically. it would give me more time... but it wouldn't solve the problem
2006-04-03T15:05:00.000Z	stocksy		any powerpc users here that can help me with my kernel problem?
2006-04-03T15:06:00.000Z	stocksy		does 2.6.12-10 even support old world openfirmware?
2006-04-03T15:07:00.000Z	stocksy	GTroy	that's a pretty broad question
2006-04-03T15:07:00.000Z	stocksy		what kind?
2006-04-03T15:07:00.000Z	IsilZha	stocksy	i got to go anyway... thanks for trying to help me out
