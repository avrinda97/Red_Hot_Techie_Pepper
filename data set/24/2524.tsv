2009-02-03T15:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	srx2002	you already have a decent enough driver in a package which is installed by default, just needs some xorg.conf confi
2009-02-03T15:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	srx2002	thats where you need the drivers for
2009-02-03T15:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	srx2002	video isnt 3d so a fast enough pc can render the image
2009-02-03T15:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	srx2002	check the link and update your xorg.conf, then restart x
2009-02-03T16:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	srx2002	thats why its not giving you full 3d, you need to edit the file (you'll need gksudo gedit or sudo nano) and add entrys similar to the site I gave you

2009-02-03T16:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	srx2002	then install build-essential and compile away
2009-02-03T16:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	srx2002	its like any otehr program: sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install build-essential
2009-02-03T16:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	srx2002	then its installed, read the readme and compile away
