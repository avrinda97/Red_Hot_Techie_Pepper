2012-04-30T19:24:00.000Z	beefcafe		hi,  I'm trying to use monotone on ubuntu. it says error while loading shared libraries: libbotan-1.8.2.so: cannot open shared object file: no such file or directory. but I do have libbotan-1.8.2
2012-04-30T19:26:00.000Z	LjL	beefcafe	have you installed it from the repos?
2012-04-30T19:26:00.000Z	beefcafe	LjL	repos?
2012-04-30T19:26:00.000Z	LjL		!software > beefcafe
2012-04-30T19:27:00.000Z	LjL	beefcafe	the repositories. using Software Center or apt-get
2012-04-30T19:27:00.000Z	LjL	beefcafe	that's how you normally install software in Ubuntu. monotone is available in the repos.
2012-04-30T19:27:00.000Z	beefcafe	LjL	yes, I did
2012-04-30T19:27:00.000Z	LjL	beefcafe	let me try installing it myself. things in the repos shouldn't exhibit behaviors like that. if they do, it's a bug and we can go and file it
2012-04-30T19:28:00.000Z	beefcafe	LjL	ok:)
2012-04-30T19:28:00.000Z	LjL	beefcafe	are you on 12.04?
2012-04-30T19:29:00.000Z	LjL	beefcafe	seems to work for me. at least "mtn" gives a help screen. is "mtn" what you're trying?
2012-04-30T19:29:00.000Z	beefcafe	LjL	I hate no idea...
2012-04-30T19:29:00.000Z	beefcafe	LjL	I'm running 11.10
2012-04-30T19:31:00.000Z	LjL	beefcafe	what does "ls -l /usr/lib/libbotan*" return?
2012-04-30T19:31:00.000Z	beefcafe		no such file
2012-04-30T19:32:00.000Z	beefcafe	LjL	no such file
2012-04-30T19:32:00.000Z	LjL	beefcafe	did you include the * ?
2012-04-30T19:32:00.000Z	beefcafe	LjL	it has /usr/lib/libbotan-1.8.13.so
2012-04-30T19:33:00.000Z	LjL	beefcafe	the full line please
2012-04-30T19:33:00.000Z	beefcafe	LjL	-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 2790820 2011-07-28 04:03 /usr/lib/libbotan-1.8.13.so
2012-04-30T19:34:00.000Z	LjL	beefcafe	sounds like we need to file a bug. but just to confirm something, what's the output of "apt-cache policy monotone | grep tall"?
2012-04-30T19:35:00.000Z	beefcafe	LjL	Installed: 1.0-2
2012-04-30T19:37:00.000Z	LjL	beefcafe	if you want to file a bug about this, do "ubuntu-bug monotone" and then follow the instructions. say something like "Monotone requires libbotan-1.8.2.so, but the libbotan 1.8.2 package only provides a libbotan-1.8.13 file"
2012-04-30T19:38:00.000Z	beefcafe	LjL	ok
