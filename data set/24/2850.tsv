2008-07-24T15:31:00.000Z	soundray	ed0n0n	I agree -- if it's been hanging for two hours, it's probably not worth waiting any longer. Is it an update-manager process, or did you do it on the command line?
2008-07-24T15:32:00.000Z	ed0n0n	soundray	It is running the update-manager
2008-07-24T15:32:00.000Z	ed0n0n	soundray	I can use the console anyway
2008-07-24T15:33:00.000Z	soundray	ed0n0n	I would do a 'sudo killall update-manager', then 'sudo dpkg --configure -a' and 'sudo apt-get -f install' (repeat until you don't get any errors)
2008-07-24T15:33:00.000Z	ed0n0n	soundray	the update is for the whole system
2008-07-24T15:33:00.000Z	soundray	ed0n0n	isn't every update for the whole system?
2008-07-24T15:34:00.000Z	ed0n0n	soundray	I mean that its the upgrade from 7.10 to 8.04
2008-07-24T15:34:00.000Z	soundray	ed0n0n	I see. Still, that's what I would do.
2008-07-24T15:36:00.000Z	ed0n0n	soundray	I cant find any "update-manager" process
2008-07-24T15:37:00.000Z	soundray	ed0n0n	can you kill it with the X button on rght of the top panel? Do the force quit if it asks you to
2008-07-24T15:38:00.000Z	ed0n0n	soundray	killed the locale process and now it is going on, but problems with locale, gnome-base-locale and Java related
2008-07-24T15:39:00.000Z	soundray	ed0n0n	see if you can resolve those with the two commands I gave you above
2008-07-24T15:40:00.000Z	ed0n0n	soundray	also problems with eclipse, ubuntu-minimal, ... Now it is finishing the updgrade, and I hope I can fix the rest after it finishes
2008-07-24T16:05:00.000Z	soundray	ed0n0n	what's up with your earlier problem?
2008-07-24T16:07:00.000Z	ed0n0n	soundray	I'm trying to go on with the upgrade and then fix the locale stuff. Now it has appeared again I cannot "jump" I cannot kill the process of localedef. I did kill the rest of locale procs and It has continued, but I'm too close to the end to start again
2008-07-24T16:08:00.000Z	soundray	ed0n0n	is it bug #249340 you're looking at?
2008-07-24T16:09:00.000Z	ed0n0n	soundray	Not at all, what is taht all about?
2008-07-24T16:10:00.000Z	soundray	ed0n0n	upgrade hanging on locales -- sounds like the issue you're having
2008-07-24T16:10:00.000Z	ed0n0n	soundray	I will tell  you all about, if you show me how to go on with the upgrade
2008-07-24T16:12:00.000Z	soundray	ed0n0n	please look at the bug report yourself -- you're in a much better position than I am to diagnose the problems on your machine
2008-10-06T20:03:00.000Z	soundray	ed0n0n	Asuka, VSpike: could you take Windows discussions to a more appropriate channel please?
2008-10-06T20:03:00.000Z	ed0n0n	soundray	is there a channel about VMWare?
2008-10-06T20:03:00.000Z	soundray	ed0n0n	check your channel list
2008-10-06T20:04:00.000Z	ed0n0n	soundray	ok, thank you
