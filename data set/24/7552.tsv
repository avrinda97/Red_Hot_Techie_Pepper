2004-10-20T08:29:00.000Z	opi		Oi
2004-10-20T08:31:00.000Z	opi		yes, I know :)
2004-10-20T08:31:00.000Z	opi		I do it too :P
2004-10-20T08:32:00.000Z	opi		true :)
2004-10-20T08:33:00.000Z	opi		to be honest I still didn't install Ubuntu :P
2004-10-20T08:33:00.000Z	opi		Im just a fan and since it's so close to Debain, I can't help newbies
2004-10-20T08:34:00.000Z	opi		I wish I could get two days to get rid Slackware out of my box
2004-10-20T08:36:00.000Z	opi		it's not the best idea to be closeminded while using Linux
2004-10-20T08:36:00.000Z	opi		but I like the idea of creating sutch distro
2004-10-20T08:36:00.000Z	sn0wman	opi	are you a Gentoo user?
2004-10-20T08:37:00.000Z	opi	sn0wman	no, I don't have time to be Gentoo user
2004-10-20T08:37:00.000Z	opi	sn0wman	but all our boxes at work runs Gentoo
2004-10-20T08:37:00.000Z	opi	sn0wman	except for mine ;p
2004-10-20T08:38:00.000Z	sn0wman	opi	:)  all the workstations at my university run gentoo.  everyone here is a gentoo fr33k.
2004-10-20T08:38:00.000Z	opi	sn0wman	we just installed a box (server) that runs my webbased application 
2004-10-20T08:38:00.000Z	opi	sn0wman	it's just a p2@350 
2004-10-20T08:39:00.000Z	opi	sn0wman	I've ssh'ed to it, to fix something
2004-10-20T08:39:00.000Z	opi	sn0wman	but hey, no VIm
2004-10-20T08:39:00.000Z	opi	sn0wman	emerge vim
2004-10-20T08:39:00.000Z	opi	sn0wman	imagine, how long it take :/
2004-10-20T08:39:00.000Z	sn0wman	opi	10 mins?
2004-10-20T08:39:00.000Z	opi	sn0wman	more, iirc
2004-10-20T08:39:00.000Z	opi	sn0wman	around 20 I guess
2004-10-20T08:40:00.000Z	sn0wman	opi	yeah, portage is nice, but a sourced-based distro is a rediculous idea
