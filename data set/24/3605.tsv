2007-12-09T04:04:00.000Z	talcite_		well since I'm here anyways... does anyone have experience with SSH and RSA keys?
2007-12-09T04:05:00.000Z	talcite_		I'm kind of lost, I can't figure out why I can't log into my server. It just waits after the MOTD, no login request, no prompt
2007-12-09T04:05:00.000Z	Blinny	talcite_	Sure do. But I need help myself right now.
2007-12-09T04:05:00.000Z	talcite_	Blinny	heh, what problem did you run into? =D
2007-12-09T04:05:00.000Z	Blinny	talcite_	Something funny in your bashrc?
2007-12-09T04:06:00.000Z	talcite_	Blinny	hmm... I would hope not 0.o. I never touched it
2007-12-09T04:06:00.000Z	talcite_	Blinny	yeah, I'll have to double check. It has some funny messages in auth.log and the other logs, but I haven't been able to find anything on google
2007-12-09T04:06:00.000Z	talcite_	Blinny	what's the problem with your setup?
2007-12-09T04:07:00.000Z	Blinny	talcite_	Using a PCi video card means I see nothing after BIOS post.
2007-12-09T04:07:00.000Z	Blinny	talcite_	What should be grub countdown is a cursor that jumps around the screen.
2007-12-09T04:07:00.000Z	talcite_	Blinny	have you tried setting the bios option for PCI video card?
2007-12-09T04:07:00.000Z	Blinny	talcite_	heh
2007-12-09T04:08:00.000Z	Blinny		Damnit. Sorry.
2007-12-09T04:08:00.000Z	Blinny	talcite_	Yes of course. There are only two options, onboard or PCI
2007-12-09T04:08:00.000Z	talcite_	Blinny	0.o must be a real server lol. I'm just using a junked desktop =D
2007-12-09T04:09:00.000Z	talcite_	Blinny	=/ framebuffer maybe?
2007-12-09T04:09:00.000Z	Blinny	talcite_	What about it?
2007-12-09T04:10:00.000Z	talcite_	Blinny	some cards might not support it. Are you using ubuntu server?
2007-12-09T04:10:00.000Z	talcite_	Blinny	or your own kernel?
2007-12-09T04:10:00.000Z	Blinny	talcite_	This is a brand new gutsy desktop install
2007-12-09T04:10:00.000Z	talcite_	Blinny	gutsy desktop?
2007-12-09T04:11:00.000Z	talcite_	Blinny	I thought it was a SSH problem 0.o
2007-12-09T04:11:00.000Z	Blinny	talcite_	Forget it. I don't think you can help me.
2007-12-09T04:11:00.000Z	talcite_	Blinny	ahaha no, sorry about that
