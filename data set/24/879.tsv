2011-01-16T03:03:00.000Z	Lemmiwinks		Does anybody know which package installs the two files nautilus-computer.desktop and nautilus-folder-handler.desktop found in /usr/share/applications?
2011-01-16T03:04:00.000Z	sam-_-	Lemmiwinks	dpkg -S to find out
2011-01-16T03:06:00.000Z	Lemmiwinks	sam-_-	thanks a lot!
2011-01-16T03:08:00.000Z	Lemmiwinks	sam-_-	seems to be nautilus itself, but as i already reinstalled it, it does not solve my problem: when I log in, nautilus won't be started, so I have no desktop icons until I start it manually
2011-01-16T03:11:00.000Z	sam-_-	Lemmiwinks	hmm. you can put it in startup applications. this workaround shouldn't be necessary though.
2011-01-16T03:14:00.000Z	Lemmiwinks	sam-_-	this would open a nautilus window on startup which is annoying, trying it with dpkg-reconfigure nautilus now once more
2011-01-16T03:20:00.000Z	Lemmiwinks	sam-_-	still no luck unfortunately. do you have another idea? ;)
2011-01-16T03:21:00.000Z	sam-_-	Lemmiwinks	does it happen for another user?
2011-01-16T03:21:00.000Z	Lemmiwinks	sam-_-	nope it works with the account I use for watching movies
2011-01-16T03:22:00.000Z	sam-_-	Lemmiwinks	"movies", right?
2011-01-16T03:23:00.000Z	sam-_-	Lemmiwinks	i would delete nautilus related settings.
2011-01-16T03:23:00.000Z	Lemmiwinks	sam-_-	:D :D, no really Movies!, I disabled compiz there and use a different panel configuration, thats the main reason ;)
2011-01-16T03:24:00.000Z	sam-_-	Lemmiwinks	or even for gnome-session
2011-01-16T03:24:00.000Z	Lemmiwinks	sam-_-	.nautilus folder is empty, where are the gnome-session settings saved?
2011-01-16T03:25:00.000Z	sam-_-	Lemmiwinks	look in .gconf and .config. i don't know exactly
2011-01-16T03:29:00.000Z	Lemmiwinks	sam-_-	okay I'll try that
2011-01-16T03:37:00.000Z	Lemmiwinks	sam-_-	removed the wohle gconf gnome-session folder, but still no luck. checked again with the other account, which works as expected.
2011-01-16T03:38:00.000Z	sam-_-	Lemmiwinks	i really don't know. gnome is quirky. maybe compiz is the problem?
2011-01-16T03:42:00.000Z	Lemmiwinks	sam-_-	already removed --sm-disable from compiz startup today with no luck but I'll restart without compiz at all and we'll see
2011-01-16T03:48:00.000Z	Lemmiwinks	sam-_-	it did not help, but interestingly I have no window decorations any more when starting without compiz, so there really must be something wrong
2011-01-16T03:50:00.000Z	sam-_-	Lemmiwinks	that just means it doesn't use metacity
2011-01-16T03:50:00.000Z	sam-_-	Lemmiwinks	how did you disable compiz?
2011-01-16T03:50:00.000Z	sam-_-	Lemmiwinks	normally: prefs -> appearance -> visual effects  then select no effects
2011-01-16T03:51:00.000Z	Lemmiwinks	sam-_-	I started it with a command in startup applications: compiz --replace --sm-disable --ignore-desktop-hints ccp --loose-binding
