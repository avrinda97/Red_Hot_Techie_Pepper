2007-06-10T11:39:00.000Z	Deinumite	erich85	restricted drivers did it for me, (ATI card so even worse off than you)
2007-06-10T11:39:00.000Z	erich85	Deinumite	erUSUL:  no, I'll try that.
2007-06-10T11:39:00.000Z	Deinumite	erich85	after that, type glxgears to test it :D
2007-06-10T11:40:00.000Z	erich85	Deinumite	Can I fix it it doesn't work?
2007-06-10T11:40:00.000Z	Deinumite	erich85	did you use the restricted drivers manageR? after that you will need to restart
2007-06-10T11:40:00.000Z	erich85	Deinumite	I'm about to press "enable"
2007-06-10T11:40:00.000Z	erich85	Deinumite	I'm just wondering if it'll kill my computer if it doesn't work
2007-06-10T11:41:00.000Z	Deinumite	erich85	ive never had porblems with it
2007-06-10T11:43:00.000Z	erich85	Deinumite	Yeah, glxgears just looks like shit.  Will it be better upon reboot?
2007-06-10T11:43:00.000Z	Deinumite	erich85	i wouldnt have evne tried it before a boot XD it needs to load on startup :P, but it should work, heh
2007-06-10T11:44:00.000Z	erich85	Deinumite	Nope... gave me a black sceen on reboot.
2007-06-10T11:45:00.000Z	erich85	Deinumite	 Fix it. :(

2007-06-10T11:45:00.000Z	erich85	Deinumite	Yes
2007-06-10T11:45:00.000Z	Deinumite	erich85	did you change alot of shit before you used the restricted drivers?
2007-06-10T11:46:00.000Z	Deinumite	erich85	do you know of any way you can set your stuff back to default? you shoudl start from the basic ubuntu video thing...
2007-06-10T11:46:00.000Z	erich85	Deinumite	No, I have absolutely no idea how to default.  I just enabled the restricted driver.
2007-06-10T11:47:00.000Z	Deinumite	erich85	can you go in and use it to disable the drivers heh?
2007-06-10T11:47:00.000Z	erich85	Deinumite	I'm a complete newbie... I have no idea.
2007-06-10T11:47:00.000Z	erich85	Deinumite	I don't even know how to get to the console on start up.
2007-06-10T11:47:00.000Z	Deinumite	erich85	like go in and uncheck it hah
2007-06-10T11:47:00.000Z	Deinumite	erich85	ctl alt f4 gets you to one i believe
2007-06-10T11:47:00.000Z	erich85	Deinumite	No, you don't understand, I'm not getting anything upon boot now.
2007-06-10T11:47:00.000Z	erich85	Deinumite	No, that yields nothing.
