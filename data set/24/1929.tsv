2009-06-27T02:26:00.000Z	gizero		Can anyone play the video on this site in Firefox using the embedded totem plugin? It seams to require MMS support, which it does not find. http://www.easystream.no/easystream/events/presentation/default.cfm?page=1&eventid=891&eventguid=89D36C02-E840-48F0-AB82-F0FC1EE2F071&session=1&sl=&CFID=663105&CFTOKEN=68806089
2009-06-27T02:27:00.000Z	cyberghoser1	gizero	im trying it i ll let you know
2009-06-27T02:27:00.000Z	gizero	cyberghoser1	thanks
2009-06-27T02:27:00.000Z	cyberghoser1	gizero	yep you are right it needs mms support
2009-06-27T02:28:00.000Z	gizero	cyberghoser1	How do you install MMS support in Totem? The auto-search feature does not find any suitable package.
2009-06-27T02:29:00.000Z	cyberghoser1	gizero	i try that and let you know unless someone else find faster
2009-06-27T02:29:00.000Z	cyberghoser1	gizero	maybe that can help: http://www.cinlug.org/node/316
2009-06-27T02:30:00.000Z	cyberghoser1	gizero	cannot try it right now so if it works let me know
2009-06-27T02:31:00.000Z	gizero	cyberghoser1	I'm not interested in getting it to work with Kaffeine; I want it to work in Totem.
2009-06-27T02:31:00.000Z	cyberghoser1	gizero	oh i see then ill search for that
2009-06-27T02:33:00.000Z	cyberghoser1	gizero	did you try gstreamer ?
2009-06-27T02:34:00.000Z	gizero	cyberghoser1	I'm using the default Totem in Ubuntu, which is totem-gstreamer.
2009-06-27T02:35:00.000Z	cyberghoser1	gizero	https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/totem/+bug/350772
2009-06-27T02:38:00.000Z	gizero	cyberghoser1	Thank you, that worked. I'm pretty sure this is a regression, since the auto-find feature used to find mms support in previous versions of Ubuntu.
2009-06-27T02:38:00.000Z	cyberghoser1	gizero	at last it works now, seems the auto find doesnt do the job for that :)
2009-06-27T02:43:00.000Z	gizero	cyberghoser1	Actually, I installed the mms support package and assumed it would work, but it didn't. Mplayer works fine, not Totem.
2009-06-27T02:44:00.000Z	gizero	cyberghoser1	But nevermind, I'll watch it in mplayer.
2009-06-27T02:44:00.000Z	cyberghoser1	gizero	well yes :)
2009-06-27T02:45:00.000Z	gizero	cyberghoser1	Its just a bit embarassing that stuff like this not "just works".
2009-06-27T02:46:00.000Z	cyberghoser1	gizero	i know but that's the fun about linux/ubuntu you fix things and you learn :)
2009-06-27T02:46:00.000Z	gizero	cyberghoser1	Na, I'm too old to find that stuff charming anymore. It should just work.
2009-06-27T02:47:00.000Z	cyberghoser1	gizero	maybe opt for windoz then hehe :P kidding
2009-06-27T02:47:00.000Z	gizero	cyberghoser1	;-)
2009-06-27T02:49:00.000Z	cyberghoser1	gizero	if you can understand why windoz does not allow users with 915gm intel graphic card to have aero and in ubuntu you have compiz that is much better then you got your answer i believe :)
