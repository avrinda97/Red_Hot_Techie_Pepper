2005-08-11T10:09:00.000Z	Coss		Someone can help me?
2005-08-11T10:09:00.000Z	Stormx	Coss	You don't do it like that
2005-08-11T10:10:00.000Z	Stormx	Coss	a .iso needs to be burnt in a different way
2005-08-11T10:10:00.000Z	Stormx	Coss	You need a program like Easy CD Creater
2005-08-11T10:10:00.000Z	Stormx	Coss	Yes, as an Image
2005-08-11T10:10:00.000Z	Stormx	Coss	It should be able to.
2005-08-11T10:11:00.000Z	Stormx	Coss	yes do that. Otherwise, you can use WinRAR to uncompress it, and then move the files over
2005-08-11T10:12:00.000Z	Coss	Stormx	that works?
2005-08-11T10:12:00.000Z	Stormx	Coss	What works?
2005-08-11T10:12:00.000Z	Stormx	Coss	You're best bet is finding the "Burn from image" or "Burn from ISO" in nero.
2005-08-11T10:12:00.000Z	Coss	Stormx	uncompress and burn the files on it and just boot from it
2005-08-11T10:13:00.000Z	Stormx	Coss	Do the above. You're best bet is finding the "Burn from image" or "Burn from ISO" in nero.
2005-08-11T10:13:00.000Z	Coss	Stormx	i need to burn as bootable?
2005-08-11T10:14:00.000Z	Stormx	Coss	What do you mean by that?
2005-08-11T10:14:00.000Z	Stormx	Coss	It shouldn't matter.
2005-08-11T10:14:00.000Z	Stormx	Coss	But it will be booted, yes.
2005-08-11T10:15:00.000Z	Coss	Stormx	so only thing i need to know is that i have to burn it as image?
2005-08-11T10:15:00.000Z	Stormx	Coss	Yes.
2005-08-11T10:15:00.000Z	Stormx	Coss	I use Roxie Easy CD Creator. Works brilliant for burning ISO's
2005-08-11T10:16:00.000Z	Coss	Stormx	doesnt that cost money?
2005-08-11T10:16:00.000Z	Stormx	Coss	Dunno.,
2005-08-11T10:16:00.000Z	Stormx	Coss	Any good CD burner should burn CD Images (isos)
2005-08-11T11:01:00.000Z	Coss	Stormx	there?
