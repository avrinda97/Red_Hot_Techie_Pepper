2006-04-13T05:59:00.000Z	rixth	Cin	what speakers do you have/how powerul?
2006-04-13T06:01:00.000Z	Cin	rixth	heh, 5.1 200watt. You like Prodigy (I'm listening to Spitfire). :D
2006-04-13T06:02:00.000Z	rixth	Cin	is that how powerful te whole system is, or just the sub?

2006-04-13T06:03:00.000Z	Cin	rixth	not sure actually. I think that's all together. The sub can only rattle so much. :P
2006-04-13T06:03:00.000Z	rixth	Cin	the Z-2300s have a 120watt sub and two 40w sats. I got a noise complaint from two doors down last week =D
