2006-04-04T12:28:00.000Z	flonesaw_		zipper -- it might be in html.conf
2006-04-04T12:29:00.000Z	flonesaw_		zipper -- which version of Apache?
2006-04-04T12:29:00.000Z	zipper	flonesaw_	 apache2... httpd.conf seems to have become obsolete
2006-04-04T12:30:00.000Z	flonesaw_		zipper -- Well, in Apache 1.x, you set up those options in httpd.conf
2006-04-04T12:30:00.000Z	flonesaw_		zipper - Apache2 will have similar capabilities.
2006-04-04T12:31:00.000Z	zipper	flonesaw_	i really dont think so. httpd.conf seem 100% obsolete, it even says so itself
2006-04-04T12:31:00.000Z	flonesaw_		zipper4 - Time to peruse the Apache docs on the apache site.
2006-04-04T12:32:00.000Z	flonesaw_		zipper - sorry, i'm not apache2 user.
2006-04-04T12:32:00.000Z	flonesaw_		[Q]  I have problems enabling two sound cards.
2006-04-04T12:32:00.000Z	zipper	flonesaw_	fair enough, but as i said before, i tried reading the docs on apache's site earlier, only found a lot of info about the actual mods, not how to enable them
2006-04-04T12:32:00.000Z	flonesaw_		zipper -- check out configuration info.
2006-04-04T12:33:00.000Z	zipper	flonesaw_	i am, but i didnt compile apache, i used dpkg
2006-04-04T12:34:00.000Z	flonesaw_		zipper -- it's the "LoadModule" command in the config file
2006-04-04T12:35:00.000Z	flonesaw_		zipper -- You are wrong about httpd.conf being obsolete.
2006-04-04T12:35:00.000Z	flonesaw_		zipper -- I'm on Apache 2.2 doc pages
2006-04-04T12:36:00.000Z	flonesaw_		zipper - the "LoadModule" command in httpd.conf is what you want.
2006-04-04T12:37:00.000Z	flonesaw_		Biscuitian - That's crazy.  Apache needs a conf file.
2006-04-04T12:37:00.000Z	zipper	flonesaw_	ah okay, guess i misunderstood something on the way. Thanks
2006-04-04T12:37:00.000Z	zipper		oh
2006-04-04T12:37:00.000Z	flonesaw_	insta`	-- thanks much.  Docs say httpd.conf, but I've never run version 2.
2006-04-04T12:38:00.000Z	zipper		apache2.conf looks a bit more like what i was looking for in httpd.conf
2006-04-04T12:38:00.000Z	zipper		thanks guys
2006-04-04T12:38:00.000Z	flonesaw_		zipper -- then what you want is "LoadModule" in that file
2006-04-04T12:39:00.000Z	zipper	flonesaw_	yeah i know, i'm on it
