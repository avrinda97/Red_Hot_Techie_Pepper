2009-08-25T10:05:00.000Z	hornets		it will be a little pain in the ass to install
2009-08-25T10:05:00.000Z	hornets		but it will work fine.
2009-08-25T10:05:00.000Z	hornets		i know that
2009-08-25T10:06:00.000Z	hornets		is pretty lame to use.
2009-08-25T10:06:00.000Z	hornets		very easy
2009-08-25T10:08:00.000Z	hornets		it could be a little tricky.
2009-08-25T10:08:00.000Z	hornets		using vbox would be much easier.
2009-08-25T10:10:00.000Z	hornets		lol
2009-08-25T10:12:00.000Z	hornets		ok, just one more question, anyone here use NFS?
2009-08-25T10:12:00.000Z	hornets		:p
2009-08-25T10:12:00.000Z	kermit	hornets	yes
2009-08-25T10:13:00.000Z	hornets	kermit	is it possible to make a script, or a cron.. to automatically mount the remote partition?
2009-08-25T10:13:00.000Z	hornets		for example, my server get's rebooted
2009-08-25T10:13:00.000Z	hornets		or maybe a black out
2009-08-25T10:13:00.000Z	kermit	hornets	if its already mounted it'll stay mounted.  if you want it mounted at boot, put it in /etc/fstab (man fstab)
2009-08-25T10:14:00.000Z	kermit	hornets	at least thats the old school way, there might be a fancy new ubuntu GUI way
2009-08-25T10:14:00.000Z	hornets	kermit	I use the fstab
2009-08-25T10:14:00.000Z	hornets		but there's a problem
2009-08-25T10:14:00.000Z	hornets		If I turn on first my computer, and then my home server.
2009-08-25T10:15:00.000Z	hornets		the NFS don't mount the partition.
2009-08-25T10:15:00.000Z	kermit	hornets	true, but once its mounted it wont unmount if you turn off the other computer
2009-08-25T10:15:00.000Z	kermit	hornets	but you could just put it in a crontab
2009-08-25T10:16:00.000Z	hornets		let me get the error message.
2009-08-25T10:19:00.000Z	hornets	kermit	heh, do you know where is stored NFS logs?
