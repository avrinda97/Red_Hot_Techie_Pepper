2011-09-26T10:41:00.000Z	LigH		Greetings.
2011-09-26T10:42:00.000Z	LigH		I found a lot of websites talking about "Ubuntu hangs while booting unless I press a key". How may I help detecting my specific reason?
2011-09-26T10:42:00.000Z	ikonia	LigH	are you currently having a problem ?
2011-09-26T10:43:00.000Z	LigH	ikonia	Not always, but today again.
2011-09-26T10:43:00.000Z	ikonia	LigH	could you explain the problem please.
2011-09-26T10:45:00.000Z	ikonia	LigH	how do you know the mouse switches on and off ?
2011-09-26T10:47:00.000Z	ikonia	LigH	have you looked at the possability of removing the boot splash so you can see what's going on behind the boot up process ?
2011-09-26T10:49:00.000Z	ikonia	LigH	grub customizer ?
2011-09-26T10:52:00.000Z	LigH	ikonia	https://launchpad.net/grub-customizer -- used this to edit some options related to the appearance, e.g. using a lower-res mode for the GRUB menu. The shipped "StartUp Manager" is not really GRUB 2 compatible anymore.
2011-09-26T10:53:00.000Z	ikonia	LigH	I've never used that tool so I don't know how it may/may not effect anything.
2011-09-26T10:54:00.000Z	ikonia	LigH	I'm not blaming it, I just saying I don't know how that tool works, so I don't know the effects it will have.
2011-09-26T11:00:00.000Z	LigH	ikonia	Currently it has the kernel parameters "quiet splash". Shall I try to remove both?
2011-09-26T11:00:00.000Z	ikonia	LigH	up to you.
2011-09-26T11:16:00.000Z	LigH	ikonia	Just had a kernel update for new Nvidia drivers; afterwards, the booting process got stuck with the mouse switching off, but not back on, so I had to reset the PC. Then it booted after a little while without pressing any key, but not with the expected amount of logging, fsck was the first I could read. You see, it is not reliable, and I may need another source of logs to search for possible reasons. Will try with the 64-bit version
2011-09-26T11:17:00.000Z	ikonia	LigH	that to me sounds like you have a hardware issue
2011-09-26T11:17:00.000Z	ikonia	LigH	possible the disk you are trying to boot not spinning up quick enough,
2011-09-26T11:18:00.000Z	ikonia	LigH	I don't believe this is an ubuntu issue, rather a hardware issue as I've stated
2011-09-26T11:18:00.000Z	ikonia	LigH	if it was an OS issue, I'd expect it to do it every time
2011-09-26T11:19:00.000Z	ikonia	LigH	no, I'll say it again
2011-09-26T11:19:00.000Z	ikonia	LigH	I don't believe this is a software error - it sounds like a hardware error
2011-09-26T11:20:00.000Z	ikonia	LigH	if it was a software error, I'd expect it to be doing it every time.
2011-09-26T11:20:00.000Z	ikonia	LigH	so not drivers. Hardware.
2011-09-26T11:21:00.000Z	ikonia	LigH	There is your answer then
2011-09-26T11:22:00.000Z	ikonia	LigH	it's not philosophical you just said it wasn't worth the effort, so then carry on
