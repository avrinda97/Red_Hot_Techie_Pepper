2007-01-12T07:26:00.000Z	Madm3rlin		is there a way to see if my agp drivers are installed properly?

2007-01-12T07:27:00.000Z	Madm3rlin		i just installed ubuntu on this ppc, and everything is working flawlessly
2007-01-12T07:27:00.000Z	Madm3rlin		how can i tell if smp is enabled
2007-01-12T07:27:00.000Z	CyfrMonk	Madm3rlin	uname -a
2007-01-12T07:28:00.000Z	CyfrMonk	Madm3rlin	doesn't look like SMP
2007-01-12T07:29:00.000Z	CyfrMonk	Madm3rlin	mine says "Linux supernode 2.6.17-10-generic #2 SMP Tue Dec 5 22:28:26 UTC 2006 i686 GNU/Linux"
2007-01-12T07:30:00.000Z	CyfrMonk	Madm3rlin	that with a AMD64 dual-core
2007-01-12T08:06:00.000Z	CyfrMonk	Madm3rlin	just discontinued my subscription yesterday
2007-01-12T08:07:00.000Z	CyfrMonk	Madm3rlin	I had to use cedga support just to try to get my subscription turned off ...
2007-01-12T08:11:00.000Z	CyfrMonk	Madm3rlin	looks like cedga is having trouble because it is measuring your CPU speed and coming up with 999.x MHz when it is expect GHz
2007-01-12T08:11:00.000Z	CyfrMonk	Madm3rlin	when it tries to interpret 999.x as GHz it seems impossibly fast ?
2007-01-12T08:13:00.000Z	CyfrMonk	Madm3rlin	the FAQ for cedga says it does not work on PPC
2007-01-12T08:14:00.000Z	CyfrMonk	Madm3rlin	they have some closed-source code in the software and I bet it doesn't compile on PPC.

2007-01-12T08:15:00.000Z	CyfrMonk	Madm3rlin	see #8 on the FAQ
2007-01-12T08:16:00.000Z	CyfrMonk	Madm3rlin	dont give up - if you have a compiler you can fix any thing ;)
2007-01-12T08:16:00.000Z	CyfrMonk	Madm3rlin	ok, except on a PPC...
