2007-12-18T11:21:00.000Z	zzap		Hi, can someone help me?
2007-12-18T11:21:00.000Z	zzap		Got Ubuntu here.
2007-12-18T11:21:00.000Z	zzap		Trying to set up networking.
2007-12-18T11:21:00.000Z	zzap		To a group of Windows computers.
2007-12-18T11:21:00.000Z	zzap		Ubuntu can access the Windows computers.
2007-12-18T11:22:00.000Z	zzap		But none of the Windows computers can see Ubuntu.
2007-12-18T11:22:00.000Z	MasterShrek	zzap	in /etc/samba/smb.conf change it to security=share, or just manually connect from the windows machines by ip, or hostname
2007-12-18T11:22:00.000Z	zzap	MasterShrek	I tried connecting via IP.
2007-12-18T11:24:00.000Z	MasterShrek	zzap	have you restarted the windows machines since implementing the linux server?
2007-12-18T11:24:00.000Z	zzap	MasterShrek	No, should I try that?
2007-12-18T11:24:00.000Z	MasterShrek	zzap	windows machines always need a reboot =P worth a shot
2007-12-18T11:25:00.000Z	MasterShrek	zzap	do you have another linux machine around, and can it talk to that server?
2007-12-18T11:25:00.000Z	zzap	MasterShrek	No, only Windows machines currently.
2007-12-18T11:42:00.000Z	zzap	MasterShrek	When I try to sudo /etc/init.d/samba restart it comes up something like, "This dir does not exist."
2007-12-18T11:43:00.000Z	MasterShrek	zzap	do you have the samba server installed?
2007-12-18T11:44:00.000Z	zzap	MasterShrek	Yes, it should be intalled.
2007-12-18T11:44:00.000Z	zzap	MasterShrek	But if I didn't, would that result in all the symptoms I've got?
2007-12-18T11:44:00.000Z	MasterShrek	zzap	i dont know for sure, but there should be soemthing in /etc/init.d  for samba
2007-12-18T11:45:00.000Z	zzap	MasterShrek	Urgh. This is so annoying. It connects to the Windows' fine.
2007-12-18T11:46:00.000Z	MasterShrek	zzap	isnt there a samba file in /etc/init.d ?
2007-12-18T11:47:00.000Z	zzap	MasterShrek	Obviously not, otherwise it wouldn't be giving me that message when I try to restart.
2007-12-18T11:47:00.000Z	MasterShrek	zzap	sudo apt-get install samba
2007-12-18T11:48:00.000Z	zzap	MasterShrek	You've already told me to do that, and I have.
2007-12-18T11:48:00.000Z	MasterShrek	zzap	argh, gimme a minute, sorry im not using ubuntu, i dont know the names of all the packages anymore i guess
