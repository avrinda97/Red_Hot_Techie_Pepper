2007-04-28T10:11:00.000Z	mikerobi		I have a broken package that won't uninstall, what do I do?
2007-04-28T10:11:00.000Z	mphill	mikerobi	try the -f flag with apt-get
2007-04-28T10:11:00.000Z	mikerobi	mphill	no luck
2007-04-28T10:12:00.000Z	mphill	mikerobi	whats the error?
2007-04-28T10:12:00.000Z	mikerobi	mphill	Package is in a very bad inconsistent state - you should reinstall it before attempting a removal
2007-04-28T10:13:00.000Z	mikerobi	mphill	reinstalling doesn't work
2007-04-28T10:13:00.000Z	mphill	mikerobi	run apt-get --reinstall -f package_name
2007-04-28T10:14:00.000Z	mikerobi	mphill	apt-get didn't like that command string
2007-04-28T10:14:00.000Z	mikerobi	mphill	E: invalid operation package_name
2007-04-28T10:14:00.000Z	mphill	mikerobi	what is the package name
2007-04-28T10:14:00.000Z	mikerobi	mphill	k3d
2007-04-28T10:15:00.000Z	mikerobi	mphill	I tried with another package, same result
2007-04-28T10:15:00.000Z	mikerobi	mphill	not gonna work
2007-04-28T10:15:00.000Z	mphill	mikerobi	did you do an update though, that can help a lot.
2007-04-28T10:15:00.000Z	mikerobi	mphill	yes
2007-04-28T10:16:00.000Z	mikerobi	mphill	I don't think the --reinstall flag works as you think
2007-04-28T10:18:00.000Z	mphill	mikerobi	lets use aptitude instead, try aptitude reinstall k3b
2007-04-28T10:19:00.000Z	mikerobi	mphill	aptitude suggested that I manually fix the package
2007-04-28T10:20:00.000Z	mphill	mikerobi	what happened that caused this?
2007-04-28T10:20:00.000Z	mikerobi	mphill	most likely it was the package maintainer
2007-04-28T10:21:00.000Z	mikerobi	mphill	synaptic complained when I first installed it, the configure scripts were broken, but everything worked, I was hoping a dist upgrade would fix it
2007-04-28T10:22:00.000Z	mphill	mikerobi	I am out of ideas without ssh'ing to the box. sorry :(
2007-04-28T10:22:00.000Z	mikerobi	mphill	thats ok
2007-04-28T10:23:00.000Z	mikerobi	mphill	this computer is about to get its hard drive wiped anyway
