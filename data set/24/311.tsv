2011-12-06T11:43:00.000Z	plusEV		I messed up my desktop enviroment using compiz. and now I only have  grey bar at the tome. I can only get into my home folder. Is it any way I can open a terminal from here so I can enter the compiz options?

2011-12-06T11:45:00.000Z	plusEV		So how do I open a terminal from the home folder? =p
2011-12-06T11:46:00.000Z	plusEV		alt-f2 does nothing.
2011-12-06T11:47:00.000Z	plusEV		this sucks massive amount of balls.
2011-12-06T11:48:00.000Z	urlin2u	plusEV	ctrl-alt-f1 will get you to a cli.
2011-12-06T11:49:00.000Z	plusEV		y.
2011-12-06T11:50:00.000Z	plusEV	urlin2u	Do you know how to enter the CompizFusion config from that terminal?
2011-12-06T11:53:00.000Z	urlin2u	plusEV	you can't open the compiz gui from there but you can log in and run run sudo unity --reset    then reboot the unity desktop should be set to stock.
2011-12-06T11:54:00.000Z	urlin2u	plusEV	actually I don't think you need the sudo just the unity --reset
2011-12-06T11:55:00.000Z	plusEV	urlin2u	allright lets see if its fixed.
2011-12-06T11:56:00.000Z	plusEV	urlin2u	still the same after reboot.
2011-12-06T11:59:00.000Z	urlin2u	plusEV	have you tried the other desktop options at the login window. Losing the desktop while tweaking compiz is quite common, but not a problem if you find a instructional web site, getting it back when broken is just as easy. This make take a few kicks to get it back.
2011-12-06T11:59:00.000Z	plusEV	urlin2u	compiz (unity) - Warn: unsupported internal format Segmentation fault.
