2010-06-28T23:26:00.000Z	daRPiniOn		I'm trying to install ubuntu 10.04 with windows 7.  my initial attempt was using live cd and the demo and that failed because when i went into the partition area of the download it didn't recognize any of the partitions (2 both on one HDD - one being completely empty and formatted to FAT32) the second time that I tried to install I used ubuntu as a boot disk and did a direct install.
2010-06-28T23:26:00.000Z	daRPiniOn		The error message that I recieved said that it wasn't findind the .iso file because of a recent system crash, while I've had no recent system crashes.
2010-06-28T23:26:00.000Z	daRPiniOn		I'm really stumped
2010-06-28T23:27:00.000Z	daRPiniOn		I'm not a total noob and I'm having tons of difficulty installing this program.

2010-06-28T23:32:00.000Z	abhi_nav	daRPiniOn	its wrong not updated. 64 bit is recommended over 32
2010-06-28T23:32:00.000Z	daRPiniOn	abhi_nav	that's what I figured as 386 won't recognize but a third of my total RAM
2010-06-28T23:33:00.000Z	abhi_nav	daRPiniOn	hmm
2010-06-28T23:33:00.000Z	daRPiniOn	abhi_nav	would you recommend a program other than Image Burn to put the .iso image on a dvd?
2010-06-28T23:34:00.000Z	abhi_nav	daRPiniOn	from windows? i dont know abotu win. used very long ago. nero is popular. dont know. i have cyberlink here in my vista(which i use occasinally - when i become mad) ;)
2010-06-28T23:35:00.000Z	daRPiniOn	abhi_nav	is software becoming more available on ubuntu and linux in general?
2010-06-28T23:35:00.000Z	abhi_nav	daRPiniOn	there are lots of them for a very large range of fields.
2010-06-28T23:36:00.000Z	abhi_nav	daRPiniOn	yah thats where win is liittel bit ahead. but its because they do lobbying with big companies like disney etc
2010-06-28T23:37:00.000Z	abhi_nav	daRPiniOn	ther are great torrent software for linux. and remember for every (so called) great aps on win there is equivalent or much powerful alternate on linux.
