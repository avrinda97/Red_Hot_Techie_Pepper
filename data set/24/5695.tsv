2006-05-21T12:39:00.000Z	eduedix		hi. i just installed ubuntu on my amd64 box. i have x1600 pro graphic card and cant get x to work. i think vesa drivers dont support my card. so i need to try last ati-drivers 8.24.8. can you please give me a link for an easy installation ?
2006-05-21T12:40:00.000Z	watson540	eduedix	apt-cache search fglrx
2006-05-21T12:40:00.000Z	watson540	eduedix	then install the pertaining pkg's that it shows you
2006-05-21T12:41:00.000Z	eduedix	watson540	will these directly install for 8.24.8 ?
2006-05-21T12:41:00.000Z	watson540	eduedix	i dont know the current version of ati driver in your specific repo
2006-05-21T12:42:00.000Z	watson540	eduedix	but you asked for an easy way, i reccommend hitting the ubuntu wiki as they have a whole page for this stuff..kjust search it for fglrx
2006-05-21T12:42:00.000Z	eduedix	watson540	actually i dont know too.. i just installed ubuntu and dont know much about its package system :/
2006-05-21T12:43:00.000Z	watson540	eduedix	surprising that the regular MESA drivers dont work for ou
2006-05-21T12:43:00.000Z	eduedix	watson540	yes i know :/
2006-05-21T12:44:00.000Z	watson540	eduedix	the fglrx drivers are prettty painlesss these days :) just run the binary and do a fglrxconfig afterwards :)
2006-05-21T12:44:00.000Z	eduedix	watson540	so now i am installing xorg-driver-fglrx and linux-restricted-modules-(kernelversion) .. but i think it doesnt install the version 8.24.8
2006-05-21T12:44:00.000Z	watson540		although i still say hit up the wiki as they use dpkg to rconfigure the driver and its much easier :)
2006-05-21T12:45:00.000Z	eduedix	watson540	hmm.. but i think its always better to install from the repo
2006-05-21T12:45:00.000Z	watson540	eduedix	me too :)
2006-05-21T12:45:00.000Z	watson540	eduedix	dont mis-understand me you install using apt then use dpkg to configure the driver in a GUI
2006-05-21T12:46:00.000Z	eduedix	watson540	so.. can you tell me what to do for a 8.24.8 installation ? should i touch the serverlist ( i donno the file though)
2006-05-21T12:46:00.000Z	watson540		only if your nnot familar with XF86Config will you need it though
2006-05-21T12:46:00.000Z	watson540	eduedix	go to ati's site and dopwnload the driver :)
2006-05-21T12:46:00.000Z	eduedix	watson540	:P no way to install from the repo ?
2006-05-21T12:47:00.000Z	watson540	eduedix	not for a specific version , i mean if the repo has the version your looking for then great. otherwise you install manual which is
2006-05-21T12:47:00.000Z	watson540		easy
2006-05-21T12:47:00.000Z	watson540		not like yo u have to compile anything :)
2006-05-21T12:48:00.000Z	eduedix	watson540	ah.. i get you.. hm.. which server link should i add to sourcelist ?
2006-05-21T12:51:00.000Z	eduedix	watson540	i actually dont know how you call the file name that contains repo servers list.. where is that file ?
