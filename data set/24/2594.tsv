2008-10-31T08:20:00.000Z	boblemur	jaypro	press f6 when u have the options of try ubuntum install, check disk etc... and after u press f6 just del the -- splash and quiet
2008-10-31T08:31:00.000Z	boblemur	jaypro	how did you go?
2008-10-31T08:31:00.000Z	jaypro	boblemur	8.10 still stalls
2008-10-31T08:31:00.000Z	jaypro	boblemur	didnt see the splash screen, obviously, but it stalls just after it loads
2008-10-31T08:32:00.000Z	jaypro	boblemur	or after the splash screen when live cd is booted in the regular fashion
2008-10-31T08:35:00.000Z	jaypro	boblemur	havent tried safe mode. i just checked hardware info. thought it was 2.0 GHz but it's a 3.0 GHz. heh other pc
2008-10-31T08:35:00.000Z	jaypro	boblemur	intel celeron
2008-10-31T08:35:00.000Z	boblemur	jaypro	is it a del? because my del dosent work on the live cd
2008-10-31T08:36:00.000Z	jaypro	boblemur	really? heh strange. no it's not a dell
2008-10-31T08:36:00.000Z	boblemur	jaypro	i doubt its something to do with ur lack of power, as long as u have enough ram,  so it sounds like a graphics card thing
2008-10-31T08:36:00.000Z	jaypro	boblemur	its some pc that some small computer shop built
2008-10-31T08:37:00.000Z	boblemur	jaypro	kkz u could try graphics safe mode, which is just f4 on boot.. and chose graphics safe mode... have u tried an older version of the live cd??
2008-10-31T08:37:00.000Z	boblemur	jaypro	btw are u trying it with intrepid?
2008-10-31T08:37:00.000Z	jaypro	boblemur	hrmmm.... strange tho, ive tried ti on two different pcs (but bought at the same shop) and they both cannot load 8.04 or 8.10
2008-10-31T08:38:00.000Z	boblemur	jaypro	hmmm ok have u tried the alternate cd?
2008-10-31T08:39:00.000Z	boblemur	jaypro	ohh its 8.10...

2008-10-31T08:51:00.000Z	jaypro	boblemur	sweet! live cd works! but after i install the system, and booting it regularly, it wont have any graphics issues?
2008-10-31T08:51:00.000Z	boblemur	jaypro	i cant garentee that,... but i didnt
2008-10-31T08:52:00.000Z	boblemur	jaypro	after i installed it, my graphics probs went aways... but it make take a lil bit of expermienting
