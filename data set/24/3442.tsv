2009-02-19T14:51:00.000Z	Cool_Nick		It says its not installed...but it IS running with ps ax and it was selected durign the installation of ubuntu
2009-02-19T14:52:00.000Z	Cool_Nick		How do I remove something that supposedly isn't installed?
2009-02-19T14:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cool_Nick	what do you want to remove?
2009-02-19T14:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cool_Nick	sudo apt-get --purge remove dnsmasq
2009-02-19T14:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cool_Nick	failing that, install it again then uninstall
2009-02-19T14:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cool_Nick	sudo dpkg --force-all -r dnsmasq
2009-02-19T14:57:00.000Z	Cool_Nick	ActionParsnip	Will try when current installion finishes
2009-02-19T14:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cool_Nick	the --force-all is a last ditch and it just goes in with the biggest hammer and beats it into submission. I strongly suggest not using it on a regular basis as it is in no way graceful
2009-02-19T15:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cool_Nick	i'd recommend running: sudo apt-get -f install; sudo apt-get update afterwards to make sure everything is nice
2009-02-19T15:01:00.000Z	Cool_Nick	ActionParsnip	--force-all not understood
2009-02-19T15:02:00.000Z	Cool_Nick	ActionParsnip	wait, tried it with aptget trying with dpgk now
2009-02-19T15:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cool_Nick	can you give us the pastebin of the output if you try to apt-get remove itplease
2009-02-19T15:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cool_Nick	apt-get doesnt have a --force-all
2009-02-19T15:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cool_Nick	sudo kill 5205
2009-02-20T15:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cool_Nick	sudo apt-get install --reinstall xfonts-base
2009-02-20T15:41:00.000Z	Cool_Nick	ActionParsnip	tried that...but will try again
