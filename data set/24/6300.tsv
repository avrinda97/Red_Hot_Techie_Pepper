2006-10-06T16:57:00.000Z	wegstar		grrr....
2006-10-06T16:57:00.000Z	wegstar		is there a way I can install ubuntu via the old installer without having to boot into the desktop?
2006-10-06T16:57:00.000Z	wegstar		it's been running for 30 minutes now
2006-10-06T16:57:00.000Z	wegstar		and no window is showing up.. it just keeps reading from the disc
2006-10-06T16:57:00.000Z	gean	wegstar	: there is an alternate distribution
2006-10-06T16:58:00.000Z	wegstar	gean	as in another installer or a whole new distro?
2006-10-06T16:59:00.000Z	wegstar		geez.. now it's frozen
2006-10-06T16:59:00.000Z	gean	wegstar	i have the same problem: mine cannot recognize CDROM and remains frosen at mountin fs

2006-10-06T16:59:00.000Z	gean	wegstar	where?
2006-10-06T16:59:00.000Z	wegstar		it seems to be loading the installer
2006-10-06T05:00:00.000Z	wegstar		and has run out of ram
2006-10-06T05:00:00.000Z	wegstar		which is weird since my computer is beyond their minimum requirements
2006-10-06T05:01:00.000Z	wegstar		stupid shipit.. I knew there was a catch
2006-10-06T05:03:00.000Z	wegstar		...
2006-10-06T05:04:00.000Z	wegstar		so the alternate installerl lshould work?
2006-10-06T05:04:00.000Z	wegstar		i.e, old 5.10 installer
