2011-01-20T05:34:00.000Z	x_		so no one knows anything about spdif in here huh?
2011-01-20T05:34:00.000Z	gordonjcp	x_	it very much depends what you want to know
2011-01-20T05:34:00.000Z	x_	gordonjcp	why mine doesn't work I really need someone to help me out
2011-01-20T05:36:00.000Z	gordonjcp	x_	typically spdif wouldn't have a volume control
2011-01-20T05:36:00.000Z	x_	gordonjcp	well I get no output to my receiver with coax or optical.
2011-01-20T05:36:00.000Z	gordonjcp	x_	are you sure the thing you're plugging into is receiving sp/dif correctly?
2011-01-20T05:37:00.000Z	x_	gordonjcp	its a 7.1 amp. it should be fine. optical isn't showing any red light out of the wire on ubuntu anyway.
2011-01-20T05:37:00.000Z	x_	gordonjcp	my cable box spdif works fine on the same amp
2011-01-20T05:37:00.000Z	gordonjcp	x_	sounds like your s/pdif output isn't even enabled
2011-01-20T05:38:00.000Z	x_	gordonjcp	my bios only has settings for onboard audio on / off
2011-01-20T05:38:00.000Z	gordonjcp	x_	all I can suggest is hitting Google for information about your card
2011-01-20T05:38:00.000Z	x_	gordonjcp	I have and all I find is other people with the same issues, I posted on the forums too no reply.
2011-01-20T05:38:00.000Z	gordonjcp	x_	maybe it's badly supported then
2011-01-20T05:38:00.000Z	x_	gordonjcp	every pc pretty much comes with realtek/intel hd audio though ...
2011-01-20T05:39:00.000Z	gordonjcp	x_	from experience, stereo s/pdif is usually okay but trying to get multi-channel working is ridiculous
2011-01-20T05:39:00.000Z	x_	gordonjcp	I might just be missing something stupid but I dont think so since I can get hdmi to work by editing /etc/pulse/default.pa
2011-01-20T05:39:00.000Z	gordonjcp	x_	it's something I'm going to look into later, for some of my audio work
2011-01-20T05:40:00.000Z	x_	gordonjcp	are you an audio dev on ubuntu{
2011-01-20T05:40:00.000Z	gordonjcp	x_	I'm an audio dev, but I mostly work on Arch Linux
2011-01-20T05:40:00.000Z	gordonjcp	x_	I don't like pulseaudio much, though
2011-01-20T05:40:00.000Z	x_	gordonjcp	ive tried alsa too and it didn't work. I don't get this at all
2011-01-20T05:42:00.000Z	x_	gordonjcp	Im hoping I dont have to really go to windows 7 to get spdif this is a shame.
2011-01-20T05:42:00.000Z	gordonjcp	x_	I have no idea how sound works in Windows, I've never used it
2011-01-20T05:43:00.000Z	gordonjcp	x_	I tried XP but my soundcard wasn't supported, so I gave up on it until I have more time
