2011-04-20T07:28:00.000Z	wcchandler		Not even a 3.166 Ghz processor with 2 nVidia Quadro FX 570s can play 1080p without hesitation :(
2011-04-20T07:29:00.000Z	raido	wcchandler	??? there are no HDTV that even com close to tht power
2011-04-20T07:30:00.000Z	raido	wcchandler	I have a AMD Zacate that does it fine
2011-04-20T07:30:00.000Z	wcchandler		Do you get lines in the middle from it refreshing half the screen at a time?
2011-04-20T07:30:00.000Z	wcchandler	raido	^
2011-04-20T07:30:00.000Z	raido	wcchandler	no
2011-04-20T07:30:00.000Z	wcchandler		I hate you :(  /*sarcasm/*
2011-04-20T07:31:00.000Z	wcchandler		What's your refresh rate?  I can only get mine to operate at 59hz
2011-04-20T07:32:00.000Z	raido	wcchandler	maybe you have a driver issue.
2011-04-20T07:32:00.000Z	wcchandler		I was using the default restricted that Ubuntu suggested.
2011-04-20T07:32:00.000Z	wcchandler		Using the beta of whatever's coming out
2011-04-20T07:33:00.000Z	raido		Im at 60 hz
2011-04-20T07:34:00.000Z	raido	wcchandler	I dont know what is causing you issue but its not lack of processing power
2011-04-20T07:34:00.000Z	wcchandler		Hmm... are you using multi-cores/multi-threaded?
2011-04-20T07:35:00.000Z	wcchandler		I tried in VLC and Mplayer/SMplayer
2011-04-20T07:35:00.000Z	raido	wcchandler	are you watching it at 1080 or are you pushing it up?
2011-04-20T07:35:00.000Z	wcchandler		You mean the video resolution?
2011-04-20T07:35:00.000Z	raido		yes
2011-04-20T07:35:00.000Z	wcchandler		Good question
2011-04-20T07:36:00.000Z	raido	wcchandler	i.e. areyou watching a 1080 source at 1900
2011-04-20T07:36:00.000Z	wcchandler		Oh man..  It's only 720p...  so ermm..  And TV is set for 1080p
2011-04-20T07:37:00.000Z	wcchandler		Then in theory, it playing in a window, no upscaling, no "tearing"
2011-04-20T07:38:00.000Z	wcchandler	raido	Thanks :)
2011-04-20T07:38:00.000Z	raido	wcchandler	:-)
