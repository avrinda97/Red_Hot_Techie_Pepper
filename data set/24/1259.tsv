2012-06-22T18:06:00.000Z	linux_is_my_hero		how do i make keyboard remaps permanent?
2012-06-22T18:06:00.000Z	geirha	linux_is_my_hero	Via xmodmap? Put them in ~/.Xmodmap
2012-06-22T18:06:00.000Z	linux_is_my_hero		im new to this.  can you elaborate?
2012-06-22T18:07:00.000Z	linux_is_my_hero		like put the codes i used into a file called .xmodmap using gedit?
2012-06-22T18:09:00.000Z	linux_is_my_hero	geirha	can you elaborate?  i'm kinda new to this
2012-06-22T18:13:00.000Z	linux_is_my_hero		how do i make keyboard remaps permanent?
2012-06-22T18:13:00.000Z	geirha	linux_is_my_hero	How are you making the remaps now?
2012-06-22T18:13:00.000Z	linux_is_my_hero	geirha	using xmodmap
2012-06-22T18:15:00.000Z	geirha	linux_is_my_hero	xmodmap -pke > ~/.Xmodmap  # then edit ~/.Xmodmap
2012-06-22T18:17:00.000Z	linux_is_my_hero	geirha	then what?
2012-06-22T18:18:00.000Z	geirha	linux_is_my_hero	~/.Xmodmap is read when you log in
2012-06-22T18:18:00.000Z	geirha		(if it exists)
2012-06-22T18:19:00.000Z	linux_is_my_hero	geirha	don't i have to add a code to it, or did it just copy the active ones it was using into a permanent file?
2012-06-22T18:32:00.000Z	linux_is_my_hero	geirha	I'm not sure what just happened but after i rebooted to test it, the keyboard maps work before ubuntu is loaded (scroll lock controls the led backlighting), but it froze on loading ubuntu.  then i turn it off and back on, and when it gets to the "i didn't boot properly" menu for grub, it doesn't respond to keyboard inputs :-(
2012-06-22T18:33:00.000Z	linux_is_my_hero		all hail mandalord, lol
2012-06-22T18:34:00.000Z	geirha	linux_is_my_hero	hm. keyboard not working in grub is unrelated to xmodmap, but that it works in lightdm was surprising. Perhaps lighhtdm is reading your .Xmodmap too.
2012-06-22T18:35:00.000Z	linux_is_my_hero		i don't know what that means.  how do i fix it? (I'm not a computer guy i just switched to linux bc i had it up to here with security vulnerabilities in "other" mainstream OS's :-D )
2012-06-22T18:37:00.000Z	linux_is_my_hero	geirha	i don't know what that means.  how do i fix it? (I'm not a computer guy i just switched to linux bc i had it up to here with security vulnerabilities in "other" mainstream OS's :-D )
2012-06-22T18:38:00.000Z	linux_is_my_hero		!info | lightdm linux_is_my_hero
2012-06-22T18:39:00.000Z	linux_is_my_hero	geirha	what is lightdm?
2012-06-22T18:40:00.000Z	geirha	linux_is_my_hero	the login screen
2012-06-22T18:41:00.000Z	linux_is_my_hero	geirha	i mean it only works during the bios and post test, once it goes to load ubuntu it doesn't work
2012-06-22T18:41:00.000Z	linux_is_my_hero	geirha	also after I rebooted to test the xmodmap file it froze so now it goes to the grub menu to let me pick which kernel to load, and because its not responding to the keyboard, my comptuer is useless
2012-06-22T18:45:00.000Z	geirha	linux_is_my_hero	You might need to change something in the BIOS to make the keyboard work during boot.
