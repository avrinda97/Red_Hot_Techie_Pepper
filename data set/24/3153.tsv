2009-04-02T21:28:00.000Z	bpr		I'm using 8.10 on a thinkpad t61.  I've just recently pulled updates for my nvidia drivers and xserver, and now my machine will not properly resume from suspend.  I get a black screen.  Is anyone familiar with this issue and perhaps a fix?
2009-04-02T21:29:00.000Z	ikonia	bpr	which nvidia updates, from where ?
2009-04-02T21:29:00.000Z	ikonia	bpr	and it won't wake from suspend at all ?
2009-04-02T21:30:00.000Z	bpr	ikonia	i get a black screen.  It looks like it might be awake though.  Sorry for the poor answer there
2009-04-02T21:30:00.000Z	ikonia	bpr	no no, thats fine
2009-04-02T21:31:00.000Z	ikonia	bpr	so it looks like it's actaully awake, but the screen is not alive
2009-04-02T21:31:00.000Z	bpr	ikonia	yes.  though i haven't tried sshing in from remote
2009-04-02T21:31:00.000Z	bpr	ikonia	so i can't be sure
2009-04-02T21:32:00.000Z	ikonia	bpr	that would be a helpful test so we can look at your logs while it's in the unknown state
2009-04-02T21:32:00.000Z	bpr	ikonia	ok.  I can't do that right now though :-/
2009-04-02T21:32:00.000Z	ikonia	bpr	understood
2009-04-02T21:34:00.000Z	ikonia	bpr	do you still have the old kernel installed (I believe there was a kernel update with the nvidia package)
2009-04-02T21:34:00.000Z	bpr	ikonia	let me check
2009-04-02T21:36:00.000Z	bpr	ikonia	yes i have many kernels haha.  2.6.27-14-generic is the newest.  I do have 2.6.27-13-generic and more available
2009-04-02T21:39:00.000Z	ikonia	bpr	I think you have the proposed repo enabled
2009-04-02T21:39:00.000Z	ikonia	bpr	that could well be the problem, those packages are not stable
2009-04-02T21:39:00.000Z	bpr	ikonia	ah. let me see
2009-04-02T21:39:00.000Z	bpr	ikonia	yes i do
2009-04-02T21:39:00.000Z	bpr	ikonia	is there a way to gracefully downgrade?
2009-04-02T21:40:00.000Z	ikonia	bpr	ok, I suspect that will cause you pain, disable it, and use the 2.6.27-11 kernel and see how you get on
2009-04-02T21:40:00.000Z	ikonia	bpr	the next round of updates will tidy up for you
2009-04-02T21:40:00.000Z	bpr	ikonia	ok thanks
2009-04-02T21:41:00.000Z	bpr	ikonia	should i disable backports as well?
2009-04-02T21:45:00.000Z	bpr	ikonia	thanks for your help.
