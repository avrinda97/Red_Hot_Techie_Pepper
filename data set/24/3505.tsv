2008-01-25T08:22:00.000Z	p1		Hi - is there any terminal emulator that live-wraps output, or allows string search on the output?
2008-01-25T08:23:00.000Z	dehspehl	p1	string search is done via grep and piping usually
2008-01-25T08:24:00.000Z	dehspehl	p1	i.e. $ ls | grep html
2008-01-25T08:24:00.000Z	p1	dehspehl	Yes, but in the general case, the output that is already printed has to be copied and pasted to a file, then grepped.  That's inconvenient
2008-01-25T08:25:00.000Z	dehspehl	p1	oh you are trying to string search with interactive programs?
2008-01-25T08:26:00.000Z	p1	dehspehl	I want to search for some string throught all the that is already printed to the terminal, after some commands have been executed.
2008-01-25T08:27:00.000Z	dehspehl	p1	ah yes you will want to use a MODERN version of tintin++
2008-01-25T08:27:00.000Z	p1	dehspehl	all the text*
2008-01-25T08:27:00.000Z	dehspehl	p1	one with the #run command, it's a MUD client but can run any app including bash
2008-01-25T08:28:00.000Z	p1	dehspehl	thanks, I'll check it out
2008-01-25T08:30:00.000Z	dehspehl	p1	it's nice you can trigger certain events to cause other things to happen, because it was made for games
2008-01-25T08:32:00.000Z	dehspehl	p1	you could even try it as your default shell but make sure you have root available in case something bad happens (i.e. it doesn't want to run as a shell, and locks you out)
2008-01-25T08:34:00.000Z	p1	dehspehl	is it not too big/slow for use as a terminal client?  I'll try it...
2008-01-25T08:35:00.000Z	p1	dehspehl	I've missed string search for so long! Why isn't it implemented in xterm ages ago?? <sigh>
2008-01-25T08:35:00.000Z	dehspehl	p1	because tt++ is NOT a terminal
2008-01-25T08:35:00.000Z	dehspehl	p1	or a terminal emulator for that matter, it's an app that runs in a terminal.
2008-01-25T08:36:00.000Z	dehspehl	p1	you may also be interested in screen, which lets you have "tabs" in any terminal. though no greppage iirc
2008-01-25T08:36:00.000Z	p1	dehspehl	well I guess I can do the same with emacs... but that's just too slow and big. I want to be able to open a shell window in a second
2008-01-25T08:37:00.000Z	dehspehl	p1	I don't think emacs is that big unless you are running the X one
2008-01-25T08:38:00.000Z	dehspehl	p1	but I tend to like the "does just what you need" when it comes to CLI apps.
2008-01-25T08:38:00.000Z	p1	dehspehl	but emacs is slow to start.
2008-01-25T08:38:00.000Z	p1	dehspehl	I agree.  But none of the regular terminals do what I need :-/
2008-01-25T08:39:00.000Z	dehspehl	p1	yeah, which is why I didn't suggest it
2008-01-25T08:43:00.000Z	dehspehl	p1	yeah now you don't have to mess with getting unsupported packages
