2009-12-10T13:25:00.000Z	ruffus910		i_is_broken: that did not work either
2009-12-10T13:27:00.000Z	ruffus910		i_is_broken: when i do apt-get update, it says some of the sources have no public key
2009-12-10T13:27:00.000Z	ruffus910		could that have something to do with it?
2009-12-10T13:28:00.000Z	ruffus910		how do i get the public key?
2009-12-10T13:29:00.000Z	ruffus910		oh well, thx anyway, ill just wait for the ubuntu forums to come back
2009-12-10T13:29:00.000Z	eylisian	ruffus910	what repo do you need a key for?
2009-12-10T13:35:00.000Z	eylisian	ruffus910	http://hydr0g3n.free.fr/qbittorrent/ if thats the repo, i can't find a key.
2009-12-10T13:37:00.000Z	eylisian	ruffus910	no repo key is like un-protected computer sex.
2009-12-10T13:37:00.000Z	eylisian	ruffus910	it might be thrilling but it also might get you p0wned.
2009-12-10T13:39:00.000Z	eylisian	ruffus910	have you tried launching it (FF 3.6) from a terminal and seeing what errors are within?
2009-12-10T13:41:00.000Z	eylisian	ruffus910	Applications > Accessories > Terminal
2009-12-10T13:41:00.000Z	ruffus910	eylisian	How could I run something that isnt installed on my computer?
2009-12-10T13:41:00.000Z	eylisian	ruffus910	 ah.
2009-12-10T13:42:00.000Z	eylisian	ruffus910	heh, you mentioned you just wanted it to work again.
2009-12-10T13:42:00.000Z	ruffus910	eylisian	sorry, it has been a while since i asked the question. do you know how i could reinstall it?
2009-12-10T13:43:00.000Z	eylisian	ruffus910	you got it from launchpad?
2009-12-10T13:43:00.000Z	ruffus910	eylisian	i did sudo apt-get install after putting in the software sources
2009-12-10T13:44:00.000Z	ruffus910	eylisian	then today i uninstalled and want it reinstalled
2009-12-10T13:44:00.000Z	eylisian	ruffus910	right. without a key or the link someone mentioned to work around no key, your box won't pull the package.
2009-12-10T13:45:00.000Z	eylisian	ruffus910	if it's launchpad related, import the key...
2009-12-10T13:45:00.000Z	ruffus910	eylisian	when i do apt-get install now, it says there is no installation candidate
2009-12-10T13:48:00.000Z	eylisian	ruffus910	without the key the src will be ignored. if you go to : https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-mozilla-daily/+archive/ppa  which i think you have already been to, click technical details, the repo key is there.
2009-12-10T13:52:00.000Z	eylisian	ruffus910	http://www.aldeby.org/blog/adding-the-key-of-a-launchpad-ppa-repository.html use those instructions to import the key at the FF 3.6 launchpad page.
2009-12-10T13:57:00.000Z	ruffus910	eylisian	still says no installation candidate
