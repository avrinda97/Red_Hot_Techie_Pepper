2012-04-15T21:07:00.000Z	luxius	Guest41817	I remember my first time on a linux (my own install, that is). I spent a good day or two trying to install nVidia drivers. Debian doesn't like anything without a FREE license. It involved compiling drivers and other stuff I've forgotten all about
2012-04-15T21:07:00.000Z	luxius	Guest41817	those days I didn't have this kind of help ;)
2012-04-15T21:08:00.000Z	luxius	Guest41817	welcome to it. If it doesn't discourage you I bet it'll broaden your perspectives on IT ;)
2012-04-15T21:09:00.000Z	luxius	Guest41817	http://www.debian.org/ - even if you use Ubuntu, you should get familiar with Debian as well.
2012-04-15T21:09:00.000Z	luxius	Guest41817	just don't expect any "true" Debian users to help you, they disrespect Ubuntu plenty.
2012-04-15T21:12:00.000Z	luxius	Guest41817	I see Ubuntu as a Windoze version of Debian core. That's not precise, but close.
2012-04-15T21:12:00.000Z	luxius	Guest41817	get used to ls (list) as command, instead of dir
2012-04-15T21:13:00.000Z	luxius	Guest41817	case sensitivity is saved from the old Unix days, which seems irrelevant but is in fact ingenious.
2012-04-15T21:13:00.000Z	luxius	Guest41817	you should try tab completion. Type the first couple of letters, then hit the <TAB> key, it will try to complete your command/file name
2012-04-15T21:16:00.000Z	luxius	Guest41817	try typing "man man" and hit enter =)
2012-04-15T21:18:00.000Z	luxius	Guest41817	some other helpful tools are grep, more (or less - yes, commands are more/less), cat, tail ...
2012-04-15T21:20:00.000Z	luxius	Guest41817	in fact there are so many we don't know where to start ...
2012-04-15T21:20:00.000Z	luxius	Guest41817	best way to "learning by doing" is having case scenarios. You want to hook up eth0 to the internet? Fix it, you learn how iptables work.
2012-04-15T21:23:00.000Z	luxius	Guest41817	most professional artists with computer literacy choose the Gnome paint program, anyway :P
