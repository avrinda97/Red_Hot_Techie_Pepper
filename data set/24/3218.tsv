2010-05-18T05:56:00.000Z	a94060		how do i have more than one sound sorce in ubuntu? like hear music from exaile and vlc?
2010-05-18T05:58:00.000Z	Jordan_U	a94060	It *should* work by default (though obviously it's not for you). Is this a fesh install of Ubuntu?
2010-05-18T05:59:00.000Z	a94060	Jordan_U	I havent changed anything since the fresh install really. It was working yesterday,idk why now. I have a java app open if that counts?
2010-05-18T06:00:00.000Z	a94060		anything i could change or check Jordan_U ?
2010-05-18T06:01:00.000Z	Jordan_U	a94060	Close all other applications that may try to use audio and play something in VLC. While it's playing see if VLC is listed in System > Preferences > Sound > Audio (it's a tab within the window)
2010-05-18T06:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	a94060	Sorry, I meant "Applications" tab, there is no "audio" tab :)
2010-05-18T06:02:00.000Z	a94060		it lists and is on maximum
2010-05-18T06:06:00.000Z	a94060	Jordan_U	this may be worth noting? "GVFS-RemoteVolumeMonitor-WARNING **: cannot open directory /usr/share/gvfs/remote-volume-monitors: Error opening directory '/usr/share/gvfs/remote-volume-monitors': No such file or directory" is an error i get
2010-05-18T06:10:00.000Z	a94060	Jordan_U	when i try to play from exaile. in that sounds window it shows a no entry icon and then it says alsa plugin[python2.6]
2010-05-18T06:11:00.000Z	Jordan_U	a94060	I think that error is for remote volumes like CIFS shares (network filesystems).
2010-05-18T06:12:00.000Z	a94060		hmm Jordan_U ?
2010-05-18T06:12:00.000Z	Jordan_U	a94060	I think the gvfs error is unrelated
2010-05-18T06:12:00.000Z	a94060		ohh ok
2010-05-18T06:16:00.000Z	Jordan_U	a94060	When you play VLC does it show up in the list of applications?
2010-05-18T06:17:00.000Z	a94060		let me try again Jordan_U
2010-05-18T06:18:00.000Z	a94060		effing gay Jordan_U ,seems like the java app running was interfering. thank you though. i fixed it
2010-05-18T06:18:00.000Z	a94060		sorry for swearing
2010-05-18T06:20:00.000Z	Jordan_U	a94060	You can likely get the java app to not interfere by startiting it with "padsp command"
2010-05-18T06:20:00.000Z	a94060		padsp?
2010-05-18T06:20:00.000Z	a94060		!padsp
2010-05-18T06:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U	a94060	It is a wrapper around applications that try to use the OSS /dev/dsp interface (I'm surprised that java is doing that, but I can't think of any other way the app could cause problems)
2010-05-18T06:21:00.000Z	a94060		ahh okay
2010-05-18T06:21:00.000Z	a94060		thanks Jordan_U
2010-05-18T06:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U	a94060	You're welcome.
