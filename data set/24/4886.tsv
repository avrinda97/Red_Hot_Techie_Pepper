2010-07-28T13:38:00.000Z	pradeep		does anyone know an appon ubuntu for bandwith management on a network
2010-07-28T13:39:00.000Z	randy_	pradeep	bandwidth management has historically been a sticky/difficult subject in the linux community primarily due to a lack of documentation
2010-07-28T13:40:00.000Z	randy_	pradeep	truly, Linux has extremely powerful QoS tools, but no one knows how to use them ;)
2010-07-28T13:42:00.000Z	randy_	pradeep	a magical individual by the name of Alexey N. Kuznetsov did a lot of the work (and I assume he takes a lot of the credit) even though a countless number of people had a hand in it...
2010-07-28T13:44:00.000Z	randy_	pradeep	there have been *some* tools written to make bandwidth management easier/manageable, but none of them are gui based (at least not in Ubuntu that i know of)...
2010-07-28T13:44:00.000Z	randy_	pradeep	i found in my experience, though, that they weren't very good/extensible
2010-07-28T13:47:00.000Z	pradeep	randy_	am a network admin in a teaching hospital so many peeps download alot of thing where draggin n taking up all the bandwith u get
2010-07-28T13:47:00.000Z	randy_	pradeep	honestly, if you intent to run a server in a router capacity, i would suggest running something more intended for that, like vyatta or zeroshell (not to bash on ubuntu, but, server is not equal to router)
2010-07-28T13:48:00.000Z	pradeep	randy_	i have a cisco router 1800 series
2010-07-28T13:51:00.000Z	randy_	pradeep	yeah, i've looked at mikrotik before, but its pricy for what you get.  its cheaper just to build a bigger ATX server with fancy (lit. big) gig ethernet ports on the cheap
2010-07-28T13:52:00.000Z	randy_	pradeep	there really is no difference between building something big except size and power.  the proc. in the microtik won't compare with what you get in a real mobo
2010-07-28T13:53:00.000Z	randy_	pradeep	in the end, you still end up with a 'how do i do it' 'what os do i use' type of problem
2010-07-28T13:53:00.000Z	pradeep	randy_	what do you suggest  seems you are a network admin
2010-07-28T13:55:00.000Z	randy_	pradeep	well, if you want something that won't fry your brain after weeks of studying LARTC (Linux Advanced Routing and Traffic Control), let me suggest zeroshell, they have tutorials and can at least get you really close to something that would really work right without a lot of tweaking miserably in the command line, i.e. http://www.zeroshell.net/eng/qos/
2010-07-28T14:01:00.000Z	pradeep	randy_	is that guide how to configure zeroshell besides wud ubuntu work
2010-07-28T14:04:00.000Z	randy_	pradeep	ah, that link was specifically for Zeroshell, just as an example of what *it* can do.  of course, Ubuntu *can* do it.  tc (as part of iproute2 package) is an integral part of the linux kernel in every distribution.  most people will never need/touch/learn the tc command and it is so rarely employed that very little has been written about it.  rarely do people need to do what you want to do.  regardless, it is incredibly p
2010-07-28T14:05:00.000Z	randy_	pradeep	unlike vyatta/Zeroshell, though, there isn't a fancy interface for configuring bandwidth management in ubuntu
2010-07-28T14:06:00.000Z	randy_	pradeep	here's a link to some (rather simple) scripts available in the repositories for bandwidth shaping: http://www.ubuntugeek.com/use-bandwidth-shapers-wondershaper-or-trickle-to-limit-internet-connection-speed.html
2010-07-28T14:07:00.000Z	pradeep	randy_	been of great help... are you network admin
2010-07-28T14:08:00.000Z	randy_	pradeep	i ran a few ISP's in my day in the hot sun surrounded by commercial internet satellites funded with community cash... running on a budget, paying out the ** for bandwidth, baking in the hot hot hot hot sun... (enough about that ;))
2010-07-28T14:09:00.000Z	pradeep	randy_	i must say you have paid your dues lol
2010-07-28T14:09:00.000Z	pradeep	randy_	thanks
2010-07-28T14:09:00.000Z	randy_	pradeep	no problem ;)
