2012-05-16T23:57:00.000Z	amikrop		Hello. Is the auto-hide lancher option supposed to make the left column-like launcher disappear until you mouse-over it?
2012-05-16T23:57:00.000Z	amikrop		Because it doesn't.
2012-05-16T23:57:00.000Z	amikrop		It just makes its background somewhat transparent
2012-05-16T23:58:00.000Z	amikrop		It still gets in the way (it is over) of my maximized windows
2012-05-16T23:58:00.000Z	amikrop		How can I make it disappear?
2012-05-16T23:58:00.000Z	amikrop		I mean, when I maximize a window I don't want the launcher to e over it
2012-05-16T23:59:00.000Z	amikrop		Or at least the window should maximize until the laucher and not under it
2012-05-16T23:59:00.000Z	amikrop		If not over it

2012-05-17T00:00:00.000Z	yeehaw	amikrop	Did you try the slider?
2012-05-17T00:02:00.000Z	amikrop	yeehaw	I turned auto-hide on, but all it did was make the launcher's background transparent. It never makes it hide and it gets in the way of my maximized windows :S
2012-05-17T00:03:00.000Z	yeehaw	amikrop	Do you have the sensitivity on high?
2012-05-17T00:03:00.000Z	amikrop	yeehaw	no it's on default
2012-05-17T00:03:00.000Z	yeehaw	amikrop	Try putting it the highest
2012-05-17T00:04:00.000Z	amikrop	yeehaw	nothing, it never disappears
2012-05-17T00:05:00.000Z	yeehaw	amikrop	You could try this: http://askubuntu.com/a/43708
2012-05-17T00:07:00.000Z	amikrop	yeehaw	gconf-editor does not run. I just click on it and nothing happens
2012-05-17T00:07:00.000Z	yeehaw	amikrop	In the terminal
2012-05-17T00:11:00.000Z	amikrop	yeehaw	the laucher did not hide (and never does) but at least that started causing the auto-hide option when I get it to Off, to make maximized windows until the launcher, and not under it
2012-05-17T00:12:00.000Z	amikrop	yeehaw	so it didn't really fix the never hiding launcher problem, but at least I can see the whole of my maximized windows
2012-05-17T00:12:00.000Z	amikrop	yeehaw	should I file a bug then?
2012-05-17T00:12:00.000Z	yeehaw	amikrop	You could, but you should reproduce it on a clean install first really
2012-05-17T00:13:00.000Z	amikrop	yeehaw	I am on a clean install
2012-05-17T00:16:00.000Z	amikrop	yeehaw	I cannot file a bug, ubuntu-bug says development for Precise is over so I should work this through with technical support. What should I do?
