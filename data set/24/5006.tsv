2006-11-20T11:56:00.000Z	haxality_		hey, i'm having problems getting NetworkManager to save my WEP password to keyring
2006-11-20T11:57:00.000Z	haxality_		again.. just wondering if anyone knows why Network Manager won't save my WEP password
2006-11-20T11:58:00.000Z	haxality_		:P
2006-11-20T11:58:00.000Z	haxality_		well, it's the same basic process.. you install the OS, then you install apps
2006-11-20T11:59:00.000Z	haxality_		maybe it's my linux noobyness, but ubuntu wasn't any better or worse than winXP for me, in terms of the installation
2006-11-20T12:00:00.000Z	slavik	haxality_	how many times did you have to reboot during installation and which one was easier to understand what is going on?
2006-11-20T12:00:00.000Z	slavik	haxality_	:P
2006-11-20T12:00:00.000Z	haxality_	slavik	I didn't have to reboot for XP, the installer did it
2006-11-20T12:00:00.000Z	haxality_	slavik	I will concede that ubuntu made it abundantly clear what it was doing
2006-11-20T12:01:00.000Z	slavik	haxality_	there is the touchy issue of stuff working out of the box (most stuff for me)
2006-11-20T12:01:00.000Z	haxality_	slavik	also, being able to use the internets while waiting for it to install was pretty awesome
2006-11-20T12:01:00.000Z	slavik	haxality_	good argument against yourself :P
2006-11-20T12:02:00.000Z	haxality_	slavik	when you say 'stuff working out of the box', what do you mean?
2006-11-20T12:02:00.000Z	slavik	haxality_	all of my hardware (except video) works completely out of the box ...
2006-11-20T12:03:00.000Z	haxality_	slavik	well, half of my hardware didn't work with edgy, so I ended up reinstalling 3-4 times. So.. obviously something hooked me
2006-11-20T12:03:00.000Z	slavik	haxality_	agreed ...
2006-11-20T12:03:00.000Z	slavik	haxality_	dapper wouldn't install on my system because of an SATA drive ...
2006-11-20T12:04:00.000Z	slavik	haxality_	dapper doesn't/didn't have libata ...
2006-11-20T12:05:00.000Z	slavik	haxality_	ntfs can be read ... you need ntfs-fuse for writing though
2006-11-20T12:05:00.000Z	slavik	haxality_	impossible
2006-11-20T12:05:00.000Z	slavik	haxality_	want a kicker?
2006-11-20T12:06:00.000Z	slavik	haxality_	NTFS was released in 1993, ext3 in 2001. ext3 has journaling support, ntfs doesn't. Vista is not getting WinFS (which would have journaling support) and Microsoft wants to claim that Windows is cutting edge?
2006-11-20T12:07:00.000Z	slavik	haxality_	also, ext4 has been announced and is said to become stable in 6-8 months (maybe even in feisty?) and ext4 will have all the ntfs features not in ext3, but those features are not very widely used AFAIK
2006-11-20T12:08:00.000Z	slavik	haxality_	exactly, but Microsoft dumped the project and now everything from WinFS done so far will go into their database ...
