2006-12-06T16:50:00.000Z	sancho		Anyone around?
2006-12-06T16:50:00.000Z	sancho		I am searching for some help. Is this the right place?
2006-12-06T16:51:00.000Z	nuked_omen	sancho	it might be
2006-12-06T16:51:00.000Z	nuked_omen		there is a lot to learn in this short life
2006-12-06T16:51:00.000Z	sancho		I'd like offer something to community. I have a server on the net with pretty fast and stable connection and I would like to offer a mirror for installations. How can I do this?
2006-12-06T16:54:00.000Z	sancho		Guys, no advice on this one? : I'd like offer something to community. I have a server on the net with pretty fast and stable connection and I would like to offer a mirror for installations. How can I do this?
2006-12-06T16:54:00.000Z	nuked_omen	sancho	i tried searching on ubuntu.com, couldn't find a link whatsoever
2006-12-06T16:55:00.000Z	sancho	nuked_omen	Neither did I, I would not ask otherwise :-)
2006-12-06T16:56:00.000Z	nuked_omen	sancho	ok, just thought you're one of those that ask when they got the answer :)
2006-12-06T16:56:00.000Z	sancho	nuked_omen	No :) I even searched the forum, but there is a lot of mess and no real answer :-(
2006-12-06T16:57:00.000Z	nuked_omen	sancho	i think they got many mirrors already.. why don't you try something else
2006-12-06T16:57:00.000Z	nuked_omen		other kind of support maybe
2006-12-06T16:58:00.000Z	sancho	nuked_omen	They have no mirror in my country and the DL from near countries is pretty slow. I have a machine directly at the SIX exchange center...
2006-12-06T16:59:00.000Z	nuked_omen	sancho	i'll probably contact the developers.. and also tell them to make it easier to participate

2006-12-07T17:04:00.000Z	sancho	nuked_omen	I sent it over private chat, but here it is again: sancho@sancho.sk
2006-12-07T17:07:00.000Z	sancho	nuked_omen	so, what shall I do now, wait for some mail, or stay at the channel?
