2009-06-12T19:00:00.000Z	bazhang	esde	take a look in hardware drivers and be sure the atheros alternative driver is enabled
2009-06-12T19:08:00.000Z	bazhang	esde	is there a wireless switch on the front edge of the netbook
2009-06-12T19:09:00.000Z	bazhang	esde	you may need to toggle it ; should it be switched to 'off' at boot , then it would explain the current situation
2009-06-12T19:12:00.000Z	bazhang	esde	I would guess in your fiddling that you toggled it to off, thus the need to restart it with it toggled to on
2009-07-03T04:14:00.000Z	bazhang	esde	see the link above
2009-07-03T04:16:00.000Z	bazhang	esde	if you read the link I provided, you will see you need to convert it before playing it in vlc
2009-07-03T04:17:00.000Z	bazhang	esde	you could try with ffmpeg or winff
2009-07-03T04:18:00.000Z	bazhang	esde	then try converting with ffmpeg / winff
