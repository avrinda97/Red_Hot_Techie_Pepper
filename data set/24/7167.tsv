2005-04-18T10:14:00.000Z	andrewski		so no one has any freezes in hoary? O_o
2005-04-18T10:14:00.000Z	Whiffle	andrewski	i do, but only if i use xorg composite
2005-04-18T10:14:00.000Z	andrewski	Whiffle	i have it *enabled*, but not using it in any apps....  would that make a difference?
2005-04-18T10:15:00.000Z	andrewski	Whiffle	and do you have any freezes as such?
2005-04-18T10:16:00.000Z	Whiffle	andrewski	not really, since i stopped runnig xcompmgr,
2005-04-18T10:16:00.000Z	andrewski	Whiffle	then i'm at a loss....
2005-04-18T10:17:00.000Z	Whiffle	andrewski	does it freeze in any other os's
2005-04-18T10:17:00.000Z	andrewski	Whiffle	uh, no other OSes here. :)  it didn't in gentoo though.
2005-04-18T10:18:00.000Z	Whiffle	andrewski	yeah mine worked great in gentoo too lol
2005-04-18T10:18:00.000Z	andrewski	Whiffle	hmm.
2005-04-18T10:18:00.000Z	Whiffle	andrewski	i was getting some nasty freezes up until today but i reset my bios and its been happy since.
2005-04-18T10:19:00.000Z	Whiffle	andrewski	you might scroll through the output of "dmesg" and see if theres any obvious errors...
2005-04-18T10:19:00.000Z	andrewski	Whiffle	problem is that i can use my computer for days but if do specific (and unreproducible) things in specific apps, X freezes.  (i can still ssh in and kill it though.)
2005-04-18T10:19:00.000Z	andrewski	Whiffle	would any errors in dmesg be there before it freezes, or only when it does?
2005-04-18T10:20:00.000Z	Whiffle	andrewski	yes thats ahppened to me, in firefox mostly, but it hasn't done it in the last few hours
2005-04-18T10:20:00.000Z	andrewski	Whiffle	hours?  sheesh.
2005-04-18T10:20:00.000Z	Whiffle	andrewski	well, it used to do it alot more, i havn't had any problems with it since i reset my bios
2005-04-18T10:20:00.000Z	Whiffle	andrewski	and i didn't have any trouble before some of the more recent updates
2005-04-18T10:20:00.000Z	andrewski	Whiffle	so the dmesg errors?  should i look now or when it freezes?
2005-04-18T10:21:00.000Z	Whiffle	andrewski	both ? :D
2005-04-18T10:21:00.000Z	andrewski	Whiffle	fair enough. ^_^
2005-04-18T10:29:00.000Z	andrewski	Whiffle	yeah... :(
2005-04-18T10:37:00.000Z	andrewski	Whiffle	Xfce!  hear hear!
2005-04-18T10:38:00.000Z	andrewski	Whiffle	yes, indeed.
