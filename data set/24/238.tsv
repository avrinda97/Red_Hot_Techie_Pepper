2012-02-15T00:45:00.000Z	skltlf	wubiii	if you pause the download, I believe it remains on restart, but I'm not 100% on that
2012-02-15T00:45:00.000Z	wubiii	skltlf	i am not downloading anything, the iso is already downloaded, i run a setup and it is not progressing, i dont know how to cancel it and shutdown the pc

2012-02-15T00:46:00.000Z	skltlf		whats the distro, MINT?

2012-02-15T00:47:00.000Z	wubiii		the GUI hides why it got stuck ...
