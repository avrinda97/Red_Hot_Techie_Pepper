2006-02-25T08:00:00.000Z	Mordof		k, thats what it hought
2006-02-25T08:00:00.000Z	Mordof		i thought*(
2006-02-25T08:01:00.000Z	LjL	Mordof	but that's a *good* thing. it won't let you (or your programs) mess with your system unless you *clearly* specify so
2006-02-25T08:15:00.000Z	LjL	Mordof	what about just using "wine /home/you/.wine/whatever" instead of the cd thing?
2006-02-25T08:17:00.000Z	Mordof	LjL	entirely in quotes?
2006-02-25T08:17:00.000Z	LjL	Mordof	not sure. don't think
2006-02-25T08:17:00.000Z	LjL	Mordof	just add it at the end.
2006-02-25T08:18:00.000Z	Mordof	LjL	it doesn't open anything up when i do that
2006-02-25T08:18:00.000Z	LjL	Mordof	try running that command from a shell first
2006-02-25T08:19:00.000Z	Mordof	LjL	i need to cd to the dir first and then call the game or wine goes into a zombie state
2006-02-25T08:19:00.000Z	LjL	Mordof	uhm... i don't have gnome, so i don't know what the controls in the menu editor are... but is there not some box where you can type a "working directory" for the program?
2006-02-25T08:21:00.000Z	Mordof	LjL	not that i can see
2006-02-27T15:09:00.000Z	LjL	Mordof	"sudo apt-get --purge remove <package>" should remove all traces of a packages (config files included!)
2006-02-27T15:10:00.000Z	Mordof	LjL	ive already gotten rid of it through synaptic
2006-02-27T15:10:00.000Z	LjL	Mordof	if you didn't "purge", not everything will have been removed
2006-02-27T15:12:00.000Z	Mordof	LjL	i just tried installing an removing with purge again, still doesn't get rid of it
2006-02-27T15:12:00.000Z	LjL	Mordof	well, there was no need to reinstall first anyway
2006-02-27T15:12:00.000Z	Mordof	LjL	what other option did i have? i couldnt remove it so how would i be able to get rid of anything
2006-02-27T15:12:00.000Z	LjL	Mordof	are you sure there aren't any other webmin-related packages still installed? try "dpkg --get-selections | grep -i webmin"
2006-02-27T15:13:00.000Z	Mordof	LjL	yeah that comes up with 2 things..
2006-02-27T15:13:00.000Z	LjL	Mordof	well no i was just telling you for your information that you don't need to re-install a package to purge it, you can just purge it while it's not installed
2006-02-27T15:13:00.000Z	Mordof	LjL	oh, ok
2006-02-27T15:14:00.000Z	LjL	Mordof	you're *probably* safe removing those two things. i've got no webmin related package installed. do check first, though ;)
2006-02-27T15:14:00.000Z	Mordof	LjL	apparently webmin-proftpd also installed just webmin, i guess webmin-proftpd was just the plugin for the ftp server
