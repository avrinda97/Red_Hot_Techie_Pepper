2012-04-29T21:19:00.000Z	family		using fstab, how do i mount an SMB folder that has a space in the name?
2012-04-29T21:20:00.000Z	gmachine_24	family	use the '*' symbol? without the quotes
2012-04-29T21:22:00.000Z	gmachine_24	family	or you can rename the folder........... perhaps
2012-04-29T21:23:00.000Z	gmachine_24	family	when I have a blank space in a name I use the asterisk to fill in the blank(s)
2012-04-29T21:24:00.000Z	gmachine_24	family	although I don't know if the asterisk will work in the fstab file
2012-04-29T21:25:00.000Z	family	gmachine_24	says no such dir.
2012-04-29T21:25:00.000Z	family	gmachine_24	i tried "" but thats a no.
2012-04-29T21:26:00.000Z	gmachine_24	family	ok. well, you don't use quotes, right?
2012-04-29T21:27:00.000Z	family	gmachine_24	i also tried without and with %20 as when i click the SA in GUI it has the %20
2012-04-29T21:28:00.000Z	family	gmachine_24	i tried "" but thats a no.

2012-04-29T21:34:00.000Z	family	gmachine_24	It's ok that last one fixed it once i got the caps in correct.  thanks for the help \040
2012-04-29T21:36:00.000Z	gmachine_24	family	great!!
2012-04-29T21:37:00.000Z	gmachine_24	family	so the * worked? or was it something else
2012-04-29T21:38:00.000Z	family	gmachine_24	Nope, that link did with the \040
2012-04-29T21:39:00.000Z	family	gmachine_24	Nope, that link did with the \040 instead of *
2012-04-29T21:39:00.000Z	gmachine_24	family	you should save that info and make it available to others as needed.
2012-04-29T21:39:00.000Z	family	gmachine_24	indeed..
