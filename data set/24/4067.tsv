2008-03-08T02:29:00.000Z	olie		Hi all. What's the package to install other packages such as limewire and skype? Thx.
2008-03-08T02:30:00.000Z	jrib	olie	I'd recommend frostwire over limewire
2008-03-08T02:30:00.000Z	jrib	olie	you need to be more specific then
2008-03-08T02:31:00.000Z	jrib	olie	no. automatix = bad
2008-03-08T02:31:00.000Z	jrib	olie	really.  Use the medibuntu repository if you want skype.  There's no reason to use automatix.  Read the link ubotu gave you about it to see why
2008-03-08T02:32:00.000Z	olie	jrib	Ok, let me read it then. Thx a million.
2008-03-08T02:37:00.000Z	jrib	olie	use the medibuntu to install skype.  Instead of limewire, install frostwire (google and install the .deb from their site)

2008-11-17T01:05:00.000Z	jrib	olie	did you format it?
2008-11-17T01:06:00.000Z	olie	jrib	No.
2008-11-17T01:06:00.000Z	jrib	olie	format it
2008-11-17T01:06:00.000Z	olie	jrib	ok.. what tool should I use?
2008-11-17T01:06:00.000Z	olie	jrib	ok!
2008-11-17T01:06:00.000Z	olie	jrib	what filesystem???
2008-11-17T01:07:00.000Z	jrib	olie	you have to decide that.  If you are only going to be using it with linux, I'd go with ext3
2008-11-17T01:07:00.000Z	olie	jrib	And if I want to keep the door open to MS?
2008-11-17T01:08:00.000Z	jrib	olie	well then you might want to consider vfat but then you lose the ability to set permissions on the files.  Personally, I would still go with ext3 and just use a special driver on windows to access the files
2008-11-17T01:10:00.000Z	olie	jrib	What other problems could I have other than loosing file permissions? This does not sem a big problem for me...
2008-11-17T01:10:00.000Z	jrib	olie	don't see others
2008-11-17T01:11:00.000Z	olie	jrib	Do u think vfat would work smoothly using a backup tool like sbackup?
2008-11-17T01:12:00.000Z	jrib	olie	you may have some problems but that's just a guess
2008-11-17T01:12:00.000Z	jrib	olie	you can always test it out and switch if there's a problem
2008-11-17T01:12:00.000Z	olie	jrib	I dont like problems... :-)
2008-11-17T01:13:00.000Z	olie	jrib	Thanks a lot! :)
