2012-02-06T04:35:00.000Z	Oer	StephenHawking	yes you did, but not the src source-code
2012-02-06T04:36:00.000Z	StephenHawking	Oer	src makes no difference to me, just slows up the update of the repo dbs imho
2012-02-06T04:37:00.000Z	StephenHawking	Oer	now, is there anything i need to to to stop ubuntu from trying to go roughe on me and wanting to dist-upgrade to a newer version?
