2007-01-06T06:26:00.000Z	manience		hi guys
2007-01-06T06:27:00.000Z	manience		i hate this ugly boot splash in ubuntu 6.10...
2007-01-06T06:28:00.000Z	manience		...is there a way to deactive that splash screen
2007-01-06T06:29:00.000Z	ikonia	manience	ubuntu-desktop is just a meta package
2007-01-06T06:30:00.000Z	manience	ikonia	i know... but includes important thinks, isnt it?
2007-01-06T06:36:00.000Z	ikonia	manience	md5sum can I think
2007-01-06T06:37:00.000Z	manience	ikonia	md5sum? what to you mean? im searching for a prog
2007-01-06T06:42:00.000Z	ikonia	manience	what do you mean
2007-01-06T06:43:00.000Z	manience	ikonia	there is a support to protect to boot menu by set a password
2007-01-06T06:43:00.000Z	ikonia	manience	yes there is
2007-01-06T06:43:00.000Z	manience	ikonia	u can set this password in the /boot/grub/menu.kst
2007-01-06T06:44:00.000Z	manience	ikonia	i thought, its secure to type this password in a md5 string
2007-01-06T06:44:00.000Z	ikonia	manience	why not just type it and let grub encrypt it
2007-01-06T06:45:00.000Z	manience	ikonia	let grub encrypt it? grub can encrypt my password? whats the way for? i thought u have to type this password in the menu.lst file?
2007-01-06T06:46:00.000Z	ikonia	manience	I could be wrong on that, but I /think/ there is a grub option that lets you put it into the file through grub that uses a kernel encyption module
2007-01-06T06:47:00.000Z	manience	ikonia	may be by typing grub --md5?
2007-01-06T06:47:00.000Z	ikonia	manience	something like that
2007-01-06T06:49:00.000Z	manience	ikonia	if im wrong and im typing a false, is there still a way to boot linux?
2007-01-06T06:49:00.000Z	manience	ikonia	maybe through a live cd and rewriting the menu.lst?
2007-01-06T06:49:00.000Z	ikonia	manience	the password doesn't stop it booting, it stops you editing it
2007-01-06T06:49:00.000Z	ikonia	manience	I don't htink the password option is controlled from menu.lst I think its part of the install onto the boot sector
2007-01-06T06:50:00.000Z	manience	ikonia	ah yes, ure right
2007-01-06T06:50:00.000Z	manience	ikonia	thx
2007-01-06T06:50:00.000Z	ikonia	manience	no problem, you may want to check as what I'm saying is from memory
