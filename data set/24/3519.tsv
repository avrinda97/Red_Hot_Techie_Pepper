2008-01-10T17:06:00.000Z	zionpsyfer	erpo	Do you have the bluetooth manager?
2008-01-10T17:06:00.000Z	erpo	zionpsyfer	You mean the system tray applet? Yes, I do.
2008-01-10T17:06:00.000Z	erpo	zionpsyfer	It doesn't tell me whether or not the connection is encrypted either.
2008-01-10T17:07:00.000Z	zionpsyfer	erpo	Hmmm, let me check something.
2008-01-10T17:08:00.000Z	zionpsyfer	erpo	Something like this? http://www.ubuntugeek.com/howto-setup-bluetooth-keyboard-and-mouse-in-ubuntu.html
2008-01-10T17:09:00.000Z	erpo	zionpsyfer	I've tried those instructions. They can't tell me if the keyboard-laptop connection is encrypted.
2008-01-10T17:11:00.000Z	zionpsyfer	erpo	 And you've set the 'encrypt enable' flags for the keyboard in hcid.conf?
2008-01-10T17:12:00.000Z	erpo	zionpsyfer	I've tried it the way suggested in that howto and I've tried not editing the configuration file.
2008-01-10T17:12:00.000Z	erpo	zionpsyfer	Both ways work, but neither way actually tells me whether or not the connection between the keyboard and the laptop is actually really being encrypted.
2008-01-10T17:16:00.000Z	zionpsyfer	erpo	I read a threads where enabling encryption broke the set up.  I'll go through the man pages, but that would indicate that it might force encryption for the device.
2008-01-10T17:19:00.000Z	zionpsyfer	erpo	Does 'hidd --show' give any information on them?
2008-01-10T17:19:00.000Z	erpo	zionpsyfer	Yes, but no clues as to whether or not the information is encrypted.
2008-01-10T17:23:00.000Z	zionpsyfer	erpo	try 'hcitool enc', what does it spew?
2008-01-10T17:24:00.000Z	zionpsyfer	erpo	 You'll need the address of the kb, (hcitool dev)
2008-01-10T17:32:00.000Z	erpo	zionpsyfer	HCI set encryption request failed: Input/output error
2008-01-10T17:34:00.000Z	zionpsyfer	erpo	Gah hcitool con or hcitool info ?
2008-01-10T17:35:00.000Z	erpo	zionpsyfer	Both of those commands work and show information about the devices.
2008-01-10T17:35:00.000Z	zionpsyfer	erpo	let me guess, no info about encryption state?
2008-01-10T17:36:00.000Z	erpo	zionpsyfer	Nope.
2008-01-10T17:37:00.000Z	zionpsyfer	erpo	 Figures..  I'm out of ideas then.  Google isn't giving up the goods on determining whether a connection is using it or not
2008-01-10T17:38:00.000Z	erpo	zionpsyfer	I'm trying in #bluez-users, but not having much luck. Thanks for your help anyway.
2008-01-10T17:40:00.000Z	zionpsyfer	erpo	 Sorry I couldn't be more help.  If it makes you feel any better, it still looks like if you've set it to use encryption, it will.  Just trusting that it is isn't a good solution though. =(
2008-01-10T17:41:00.000Z	erpo	zionpsyfer	No it isn't. In fact, a certain file containing encryption keys has not been created, so there's an excellent chance it's not using encryption.
2008-01-10T17:41:00.000Z	zionpsyfer	erpo	Shows what I know then. =P
