2007-02-17T11:25:00.000Z	cellfish		hi there, i was wondering if there was any way I could set up mplayer as my default video streaming plugin in firefox ... it keeps using totem and totem seriously sucks
2007-02-17T11:25:00.000Z	arrenlex	cellfish	Install mozilla-mplayer
2007-02-17T11:26:00.000Z	arrenlex	cellfish	And remove totem-mozilla.
2007-02-17T11:26:00.000Z	cellfish	arrenlex	i have 6.10 and every time i try mozilla-mplayer, it acts like the package doesn't exist
2007-02-17T11:26:00.000Z	arrenlex	cellfish	i.e. enable multiverse
2007-02-17T11:27:00.000Z	cellfish	arrenlex	how do i do that?
2007-02-17T11:35:00.000Z	arrenlex	cellfish	Of course not. Nothing is really NECESSARY in ubuntu.
2007-02-17T11:35:00.000Z	arrenlex	cellfish	Especially not media players.
2007-02-17T11:39:00.000Z	arrenlex	cellfish	Have you restarted firefox? If so, type about:plugins in the address bar and pastebin the whole page.
2007-02-17T11:39:00.000Z	arrenlex	cellfish	Right-click on mplayer-plugin, go to configure, and check "Connect to RTSP media over TCP"
2007-02-17T11:41:00.000Z	cellfish	arrenlex	alright, done ... now when i run a quicktime, it runs, but some of the video is cut out
2007-02-17T11:41:00.000Z	arrenlex	cellfish	"cut out"?
2007-02-17T11:42:00.000Z	cellfish	arrenlex	ok nevermind, quicktime works fine now ... only cnn is left
2007-02-17T11:43:00.000Z	arrenlex	cellfish	Does selecting x11 as your video driver in configure help?
2007-02-17T11:44:00.000Z	arrenlex	cellfish	Also, you are refreshing when you change these settings, right?
2007-02-17T11:44:00.000Z	cellfish	arrenlex	heh, nothing was selected.. i just put it on gl
2007-02-17T11:44:00.000Z	arrenlex	cellfish	Try x11.
2007-02-17T11:45:00.000Z	cellfish	arrenlex	should that fix cnn.com's video too?
2007-02-17T11:45:00.000Z	arrenlex	cellfish	I don't know what's wrong with it. It works for me. *shrug*
2007-02-17T11:46:00.000Z	arrenlex	cellfish	That would do it.
2007-02-17T11:46:00.000Z	arrenlex	cellfish	vlc?! What does that have to do with mplayer?
2007-02-17T11:46:00.000Z	arrenlex	cellfish	No, install w32codecs
2007-02-17T11:47:00.000Z	arrenlex	cellfish	Install w32codecs.
2007-02-17T11:49:00.000Z	cellfish	arrenlex	when i try to install w32codecs, it tells me that 'no candidate version found for w32codecs'
