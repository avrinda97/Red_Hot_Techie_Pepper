2009-08-18T21:35:00.000Z	n00buntu64		sorry, brb, gtg AFK for a min
2009-08-18T21:35:00.000Z	n00buntu64		back
2009-08-18T21:36:00.000Z	OEP	n00buntu64	I don't know that just sounds like a mic problem to me; does the mic work in other apps?
2009-08-18T21:37:00.000Z	n00buntu64	OEP	yes; i can use it in windows fine
2009-08-18T21:37:00.000Z	OEP	n00buntu64	what about other apps in ubuntu though?
2009-08-18T21:37:00.000Z	n00buntu64		haven't tried, i rarely use mic in other apps's, what can i test it in?
2009-08-18T21:38:00.000Z	OEP	n00buntu64	I was thinking skype if you've installed it or just search apt for a basic recording app... I agree on the fact there's not much else to use it for :o)
2009-08-18T21:39:00.000Z	n00buntu64		brb, seeing if i have sound recorder installed
2009-08-18T21:39:00.000Z	n00buntu64		sweet, i do, testig recording now
2009-08-18T21:41:00.000Z	n00buntu64		tested it in sound recorder, and it's real quiet, yet in windows i can be heard clearly when i record on there, or talk in teamspeak
2009-08-18T21:42:00.000Z	OEP	n00buntu64	not garbled then? well that's a start...
2009-08-18T21:44:00.000Z	n00buntu64		any recommendations, i've even tried followig the steps on the TeamSpeak forums and no luck
2009-08-18T21:45:00.000Z	OEP	n00buntu64	(haven't used TS in ubuntu) but I'd be goofing with the settings.
2009-08-18T21:45:00.000Z	n00buntu64		if i linked the forums info, would it make more sense to you to what i was trying to do?
2009-08-18T21:46:00.000Z	n00buntu64		it's got me doing all this stuff i've never done before, i'm too used to GUI vs CLI
2009-08-18T21:46:00.000Z	OEP	n00buntu64	I have to head out in a sec so I'm not much help
2009-08-18T21:46:00.000Z	n00buntu64		kk, hope you have a good one OEP
2009-08-18T21:46:00.000Z	OEP	n00buntu64	but the fact that your mic works in sound recorder is good to know
