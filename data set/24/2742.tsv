2008-09-02T02:23:00.000Z	LazyGun3		Dres: perhaps I typed it in wrong

2008-09-02T02:24:00.000Z	dres	LazyGun3	do "ls /etc/init.d/alsa*"
2008-09-02T02:24:00.000Z	dres	LazyGun3	it's probably "/etc/init.d/alsa-utils restart"
2008-09-02T02:24:00.000Z	dres	LazyGun3	sorry remembered hte script name incorrectly.

2008-09-02T02:25:00.000Z	LazyGun3	dres	It seemed not to help
2008-09-02T02:26:00.000Z	dres	LazyGun3	didn't think it would, but did't hurt.  anything from the web search?
2008-09-02T02:26:00.000Z	LazyGun3	dres	Looking
2008-09-02T02:26:00.000Z	LazyGun3		Dres: Not really too much though

2008-09-02T02:28:00.000Z	LazyGun3		Dres: Would updating the kernel help at all?
2008-09-02T02:29:00.000Z	dres	LazyGun3	it could if the kernel handles it in a newer version.
2008-09-02T02:29:00.000Z	LazyGun3		Dres: How do I tell if I have the latest version
2008-09-02T02:29:00.000Z	LazyGun3		?
2008-09-02T02:30:00.000Z	dres	LazyGun3	run synaptic I guess and update then look for a newer version.
