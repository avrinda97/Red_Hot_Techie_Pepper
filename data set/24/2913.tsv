2008-06-28T18:27:00.000Z	halfSource		im a linux noob, im looking for a simple easy to use java IDE, any suggestions?
2008-06-28T18:28:00.000Z	WalloO	halfSource	use eclipse and add jigloo plugin
2008-06-28T18:29:00.000Z	halfSource	WalloO	whats the plugin?
2008-06-28T18:29:00.000Z	WalloO	halfSource	eclipse is the best ide. It's in your repository (synaptic). However, a new version (3.4 Ganimede) is available at eclipse.org. You don't have to install it, just unack somwhere and run eclipse.
2008-06-28T18:30:00.000Z	WalloO	halfSource	in fact it is useful only if you want to create SWT or Swing interfaces using point and click system.
2008-06-28T18:31:00.000Z	halfSource	WalloO	i just need it for simple stuff, high school comp class
2008-06-28T18:32:00.000Z	WalloO	halfSource	ok. But eclipse is really the best thing you can find for Java. There is no ide which can be better than eclipse. It's really too good. If you use another one after eclipse, you will cry.
2008-06-28T18:33:00.000Z	halfSource	WalloO	well, i dislike sorrow, so ill stick with eclipse
2008-06-28T18:34:00.000Z	WalloO	halfSource	I don't know sorrow, but eclipse, is really the reference. Eclipse display errors in realtime while you code, it propose solution, etc... The refactoring option is really good to rename one variable everywhere, move a class, do all this things which usually are a headack
2008-06-28T18:35:00.000Z	WalloO	halfSource	trust me, I'm a java programmer, and I can't code with any other ide now.
2008-06-28T18:35:00.000Z	WalloO	halfSource	to install it, just run: sudo apt-get install eclipse
2008-06-28T18:36:00.000Z	halfSource	WalloO	ok im gonna go with it, ive never written a line in java though so im new at it
2008-06-28T18:36:00.000Z	WalloO	halfSource	after, if you want the last version, go to http://www.eclipse.org
2008-06-28T18:36:00.000Z	WalloO	halfSource	eclipse will really help you.
2008-06-28T18:37:00.000Z	halfSource	WalloO	k thanx
2008-06-28T18:38:00.000Z	halfSource	WalloO	btw u know anything good for C++ or C?
2008-06-28T18:39:00.000Z	WalloO	halfSource	eclipse can do C,C++, but I don'T know if it's better than kdevelop for that
2008-06-28T18:40:00.000Z	halfSource	WalloO	i use C in robotics so a C ide would be great, ill try it with eclipse, r there just other modules for that that i need to install?
2008-06-28T18:41:00.000Z	WalloO	halfSource	go to ecliupse.org, you will find everything you need
2008-06-28T18:41:00.000Z	halfSource	WalloO	ok, right now its installing with the package manager then ill check out the site
