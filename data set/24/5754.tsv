2009-11-06T04:14:00.000Z	prower	ikonia	Supposing that there's a rather essential set of libraries like libstdc++-5 that are completely missing from karmic's repositories but are needed to run a lot of older, closed-source software that worked in Jaunty, what would your recommendation be there?
2009-11-06T04:14:00.000Z	ikonia	prower	speak to the maintainers to get them included ASAP
2009-11-06T04:15:00.000Z	prower	ikonia	Good idea :> And how would you speak to the maintainer of a package that isn't maintained in karmic any longer?
2009-11-06T04:15:00.000Z	ikonia	prower	speak to the maintainer and ask them to maintain it in karmic
2009-11-06T04:16:00.000Z	prower	ikonia	I think you're missing the point just a little bit :P Thanks, but never mind
2009-11-06T04:16:00.000Z	ikonia	prower	I'm not - if the packge doesn't exist, either speak to the old package maintaiers to bring it forward, or log a request for a new package to be created as a new project
2009-11-06T04:16:00.000Z	ikonia	prower	I'd be surprised if the legacy libraries are removed though
2009-11-06T04:17:00.000Z	prower	ikonia	Oh, I was surprised too of course, but that doesn't really change the fact that there's no libstdc++-5 package to be found in Synaptic
2009-11-06T04:17:00.000Z	ikonia	prower	ahhh so there really isnt one, I thought  you where suggesting in theory
2009-11-06T04:18:00.000Z	ikonia	prower	in that case contact the jaunty maintainer and ask them to bring it forward if possible
2009-11-06T04:18:00.000Z	prower	ikonia	No, in "theory" they -should- be there :P In practice they're obliterated
2009-11-06T04:18:00.000Z	ikonia	prower	didn't realise they had actually gone, sorry
2009-11-06T04:29:00.000Z	prower	ikonia	You might do better to tell him the "right" way to do it rather than insult his intelligence? :>
2009-11-06T04:30:00.000Z	ikonia	prower	I'm getting there, I'm not insulting his intelligence in the slightlyest
2009-11-06T04:30:00.000Z	prower	ikonia	Incidentally slightlyest isn't even a word, but fair enough :P
2009-11-06T04:31:00.000Z	ikonia	prower	fat finger problem
2009-11-06T04:34:00.000Z	prower	ikonia	I wasn't aware there was a channel policy against "silly greetings?" What constitutes a silly greeting?
2009-11-06T04:34:00.000Z	ikonia	prower	unessasarry noise is the policy
2010-10-11T17:36:00.000Z	ikonia	prower	ask the orcale guys
2010-10-11T17:37:00.000Z	ikonia	prower	check the bug report
2010-10-11T17:37:00.000Z	prower	ikonia	i did, https://bugs.launchpad.net/indicator-application/+bug/625793...i was hoping that someone else may have found something, as it makes maverick unusable for anyone who types in a language besides english :>
2010-10-11T17:38:00.000Z	ikonia	prower	nope, bug report is the best place to track it
2011-03-23T21:03:00.000Z	ikonia	prower	let it go,
2011-03-23T21:03:00.000Z	ikonia	prower	stop it
