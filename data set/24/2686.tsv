2008-10-31T04:56:00.000Z	yowshi		awww no upgrade option yet eh?
2008-10-31T04:56:00.000Z	csilk	yowshi	?
2008-10-31T04:57:00.000Z	csilk	yowshi	sorry I though you were saying there was no update option from hardy to intrepid, of course it was hard to tell what you meant when you said so little
2008-10-31T04:58:00.000Z	yowshi	csilk	yeah i know i can download the cd. but i dont see the option in the update manager yet to upgrade to intrepid. dont really wanna lose half my programmes to a fresh install
2008-10-31T04:58:00.000Z	yowshi	csilk	not to mention everything on my desktop
2008-10-31T04:58:00.000Z	csilk	yowshi	 i think you have to fully update hardy before the option appears
2008-10-31T04:58:00.000Z	yowshi	csilk	did that
2008-10-31T04:59:00.000Z	csilk	yowshi	susod apt-get update there may be more updates
2008-10-31T05:00:00.000Z	yowshi	csilk	well there hae been 3 updates for the last 2 months i cant actually accept because the option to select them isnt there. the box is greyed out
2008-10-31T05:00:00.000Z	csilk	yowshi	that's pretty strange and it could also be the problem
2008-10-31T05:01:00.000Z	yowshi	csilk	i just presumed they were for the non 64bit version and since mine is 64bit i can accept em
2008-10-31T05:04:00.000Z	yowshi	csilk	great the forums are down so i cant find my answer there
2008-10-31T05:06:00.000Z	csilk	yowshi	you could always check packages.ubuntu.com and get the updates in .deb format
2008-10-31T05:07:00.000Z	csilk	yowshi	potentially unsafe though
2008-10-31T05:07:00.000Z	yowshi	csilk	well how unsafe could it be i am soon to perform the semi annual upgrade
2008-10-31T05:08:00.000Z	yowshi	csilk	wouldnt that like erase any potential for damage
2008-10-31T05:08:00.000Z	csilk	yowshi	if the updates are 32bit and screw some of yoru libs up, unlikely but possible
2008-10-31T05:08:00.000Z	csilk	yowshi	 if they are kernel updates dont bother, if they are things like evolution updates then go for it
2008-10-31T05:08:00.000Z	yowshi	csilk	they are updates for like k3b
2008-10-31T05:09:00.000Z	yowshi	csilk	k3b gcu-bin and libgcu0
2008-10-31T05:10:00.000Z	csilk	yowshi	hmmm, I'm not sure what relevence they have to anything, I guess youc an try and if it goes wrong you ca always apt-get purge them
2008-10-31T05:12:00.000Z	yowshi	csilk	i'll see if i cant get furhter help on this tommorow. i would rather not bugger up any nprogrammes i got i kind of like using k3b
2008-10-31T05:13:00.000Z	yowshi	csilk	besides i have to wait till the cd downloads anyway. been having a mysterious issue with grub and i want a boot cd handy
2008-10-31T05:13:00.000Z	csilk	yowshi	cool, good look with that
