2007-06-29T08:21:00.000Z	onexused		I installed a .deb package, then tried to remove it and it gave me an error.  Now when I try to install or uninstall ANY package, it also tries to remove the one that gave me an error ... and fails, also refusing to install/remove others.  I can't 'unmark' it in synaptic.  What can I do to get rid of it, or get around it to do other things?
2007-06-29T08:22:00.000Z	lgc	onexused	, did you try 'sudo apt-get -f remove package'?
2007-06-29T08:23:00.000Z	onexused	lgc	I didn't.  I will right now.
2007-06-29T08:24:00.000Z	onexused	lgc	It gave me the same error as when I tried uninstalling it before.
2007-06-29T08:25:00.000Z	lgc	onexused	did you try dpkg?
2007-06-29T08:25:00.000Z	onexused	lgc	doing that
2007-06-29T08:26:00.000Z	lgc	onexused	'sudo dpkg -r package'.
2007-06-29T08:27:00.000Z	onexused	lgc	dpkg says the package isn't installed
2007-06-29T08:28:00.000Z	lgc	onexused	'sudo dpkg --purge package'.
2007-06-29T08:29:00.000Z	lgc	onexused	if that doesn't work, then you might try removing things manually.
2007-06-29T08:30:00.000Z	onexused	lgc	it didn't.  How do I do that? Where do I find what it installed, and how do I get it off the list when I do?
2007-06-29T08:30:00.000Z	lgc	onexused	please wait...
2007-06-29T08:31:00.000Z	onexused	lgc	ok
2007-06-29T08:34:00.000Z	lgc	onexused	try 'sudo updatedb' and then 'slocate package'.
2007-06-29T08:34:00.000Z	onexused	lgc	ok
2007-06-29T08:35:00.000Z	lgc	onexused	that will help you trace any package rema
2007-06-29T08:35:00.000Z	lgc	onexused	that will help you trace any package remnants
2007-06-29T08:37:00.000Z	onexused	lgc	And after I remove that stuff?
2007-06-29T08:38:00.000Z	lgc	onexused	yep.
2007-06-29T08:41:00.000Z	lgc	onexused	how are you doing?
2007-06-29T08:41:00.000Z	onexused	lgc	After removing the listed stuff, dpkg --purge worked.  Thanks.
2007-06-29T08:42:00.000Z	lgc	onexused	now you might want to do 'apt-get update'.
2007-06-29T08:43:00.000Z	onexused	lgc	Thanks for the advice, and the help.
2007-06-29T08:43:00.000Z	lgc	onexused	you're welcome.
