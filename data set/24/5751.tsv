2009-05-01T21:45:00.000Z	ikonia	ferman	man you control your language a bit please
2009-05-01T21:45:00.000Z	ikonia	ferman	/usr is only writable by root
2009-05-01T21:46:00.000Z	ikonia	ferman	it is not a good idea to put stuff in /usr
2009-05-01T21:46:00.000Z	ikonia	ferman	ok - you don't need to put the skins in /usr for that
2009-05-01T21:51:00.000Z	ikonia	ferman	don't use caps please.
2009-05-01T21:52:00.000Z	ikonia	ferman	you don't need to put skins in /usr - put them in your home directory
2009-05-01T21:53:00.000Z	ikonia	ferman	it doesn't have to go in usr folder
2009-05-01T21:53:00.000Z	ikonia	ferman	it can go anywhere - you just have to read the method for pointing the amsn application at your skins in your home dir
2009-05-01T21:54:00.000Z	ikonia	ferman	open your file manager, make a dir in your home directory and copy and paste the files into it
2009-05-01T21:54:00.000Z	ikonia	ferman	that has nothing to do with it
2009-05-01T21:55:00.000Z	ikonia	ferman	what link are you following ?
2009-05-01T21:57:00.000Z	ikonia	ferman	that link tells you how to install it into your home directory
2009-05-01T21:57:00.000Z	ikonia	ferman	it can be to "/home/YOUR_USER_NAME/msn"
2009-05-01T21:59:00.000Z	ikonia	ferman	create one then
