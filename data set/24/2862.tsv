2008-08-15T01:00:00.000Z	kaiwen		ok I'm gonna go, hw to do ;)
2008-08-15T01:00:00.000Z	kaiwen		bye guys
2008-08-15T01:00:00.000Z	kaiwen		!dhcp | grep tillux1
2008-08-15T01:00:00.000Z	tillux1	kaiwen	the problem is that we're using a win2k3 server as a dhcp server ;)
2008-08-15T01:01:00.000Z	kaiwen	tillux1	so the serve is win2k3?
2008-08-15T01:01:00.000Z	kaiwen	tillux1	is it also the proxy?
2008-08-15T01:02:00.000Z	tillux1	kaiwen	no, the proxy is dansguard+squid on an ubuntu machine
2008-08-15T01:02:00.000Z	kaiwen	tillux1	so the setup is like this client > server> proxy
2008-08-15T01:03:00.000Z	tillux1	kaiwen	the setup is flexible ;)
2008-08-15T01:03:00.000Z	kaiwen	tillux1	if you had client > proxy> server
2008-08-15T01:03:00.000Z	kaiwen	tillux1	you can enable internet connection sharing
2008-08-15T01:04:00.000Z	kaiwen	tillux1	b/e the two, and that has to do with iptables and such
2008-08-15T01:05:00.000Z	tillux1	kaiwen	b/e ?
2008-08-15T01:05:00.000Z	kaiwen	tillux1	I have to go, but do a google around, "firestarter internet connection sharing", "ubuntu internet connection sharing", etc. That may help with the connection in between (b/e)
2008-08-15T01:07:00.000Z	kaiwen	tillux1	so can you tell me the objective? what's the problem you are trying to solve right now
2008-08-15T01:16:00.000Z	tillux1	kaiwen	okay, here's the situation: we've got lots of winxp clients with both firefox and ie; one "main" server, which is the win2k3 server which server's as a dhcp client, domain etc..., and one "secondary" server, with ubuntu 8.04 which servers as an ltsp server and as a proxy
2008-08-15T01:17:00.000Z	tillux1	kaiwen	we now just want to make the clients use the proxy (because it's running the filter, which we need, because we're a school ;) )
2008-08-15T01:18:00.000Z	kaiwen	tillux1	ahh, ok your setup will be easier if you do clients > proxy> server then
2008-08-15T01:18:00.000Z	kaiwen	tillux1	what you do assign a static ip to the port that you want your clients to access to
2008-08-15T01:19:00.000Z	kaiwen	tillux1	then prob. have your proxy connect through it's other port to the windows server which is using dhcp
2008-08-15T01:19:00.000Z	kaiwen	tillux1	and the windows is connected to the internet, which I assume, you already have configured to share internet with it
2008-08-15T01:20:00.000Z	kaiwen	tillux1	it may be easier to also install dhcp on yoru ubuntu box
2008-08-15T01:20:00.000Z	kaiwen	tillux1	that way the clients will be assigned their own IP address.
2008-08-15T01:21:00.000Z	tillux1	kaiwen	ermm :D  I'm not quite sure what you want to say...
