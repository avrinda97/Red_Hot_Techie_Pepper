2011-04-07T22:24:00.000Z	IsoLinCHiP		How can I have the exec bit set, when I mount a NTFS partition via nautilus?
2011-04-07T22:26:00.000Z	jrib	IsoLinCHiP	what do you mean by "exec bit set"?
2011-04-07T22:28:00.000Z	IsoLinCHiP	jrib	I want to run a program via wine, which wont do it unless the exec bit is set, which it isnt because nautilus is mounting the partition with noexec
2011-04-07T22:28:00.000Z	jrib	IsoLinCHiP	pastebin output of « mount » please
2011-04-07T22:35:00.000Z	jrib	IsoLinCHiP	there are two possible issues.  One: the partition is noexec.  Two: the file is does not have executable permission
2011-04-07T22:30:00.000Z	IsoLinCHiP	jrib	Ok, correction, its not noexec, im guessing its because of 'default_permissions', hang on Ill post the whole line in a sec
2011-04-07T22:31:00.000Z	IsoLinCHiP	jrib	dev/sda7 on /media/Games1 type fuseblk (rw,nosuid,nodev,allow_other,blksize=4096,default_permissions)
2011-04-07T22:32:00.000Z	jrib	IsoLinCHiP	if the file ends in .exe, it should be executable « man ntfs-3g » talks about this I think
2011-04-07T22:33:00.000Z	jrib	IsoLinCHiP	but exec is default, so that shouldn't matter
2011-04-07T22:36:00.000Z	IsoLinCHiP	jrib	Not sure what you mean about exec beeing default, but not a single file on the drive is +x
2011-04-07T22:36:00.000Z	jrib	IsoLinCHiP	exec just means files *can* be executable
2011-04-07T22:36:00.000Z	jrib	IsoLinCHiP	or maybe more accurately, that files *can* be executed
2011-04-07T22:37:00.000Z	jrib	IsoLinCHiP	in any case, by default files that end in .exe should be made executable by ntfs-3g
2011-04-07T22:37:00.000Z	IsoLinCHiP	jrib	Communication issue here, I know chmod, etc, the file is not exec, no file is, the part is not mounted as noexec
2011-04-07T22:38:00.000Z	IsoLinCHiP	jrib	ntfs-3g is installed, so I would hope that nautilus uses it by default to mount, which it beeing mounted as rw would indicate to me, still leaving my original question where can I change the default settings for nautilus mount
2011-04-07T22:39:00.000Z	jrib	IsoLinCHiP	does the file end in .exe?
2011-04-07T22:39:00.000Z	IsoLinCHiP	jrib	*sigh* yes, it does.
2011-04-07T22:40:00.000Z	jrib	IsoLinCHiP	ah, well that is interesting (and unfortunate
2011-04-07T22:40:00.000Z	IsoLinCHiP	jrib	meaning your out of ideas as well? ;)
2011-04-07T22:41:00.000Z	jrib	IsoLinCHiP	well unmount it, mount it manually to figure out proper options you want first.  You can modify the options in gconf somewhere
2011-04-07T22:44:00.000Z	IsoLinCHiP	jrib	Yes, I was hoping someone here could tell me specifically where that 'somewhere in gconf' is ;)
2011-04-07T22:45:00.000Z	jrib	IsoLinCHiP	search for "ntfs" :)
2011-04-07T22:46:00.000Z	IsoLinCHiP	jrib	gconf-editor -> search for ntfs -> pattern not found, or did you mean somewhere else?
2011-04-07T22:46:00.000Z	jrib	IsoLinCHiP	nope, in that case it's probably not there anymore
