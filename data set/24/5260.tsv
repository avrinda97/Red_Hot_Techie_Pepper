2008-06-08T18:51:00.000Z	scunizi	Elijah	xchat is a better irc client.. Pidgin is a good chat client.. the two don't always mix.. I'd switch. you might be happier in the future.
2008-06-08T18:52:00.000Z	scunizi	Elijah	what do you mean as portable.. on a usb stick?
2008-06-08T18:52:00.000Z	Elijah	scunizi	yes
2008-06-08T18:53:00.000Z	scunizi	Elijah	maybe.. never tried.. there is a windows version and a linux version.. not sure if there is a unified version.
2008-06-08T18:54:00.000Z	Elijah	scunizi	- Yeah thats fine but I just want a version I can use on three different computers and keep all my settings synced
2008-06-08T18:55:00.000Z	scunizi	Elijah	check this out  http://portableapps.com/node/9398
2008-06-08T19:24:00.000Z	scunizi	Elijah	use tab to complete nicks.. much easier.
2008-06-08T19:24:00.000Z	Elijah	scunizi	Thanks
2008-06-08T19:24:00.000Z	scunizi	Elijah	now you know why it's better to use xchat on irc :)
2008-06-08T19:25:00.000Z	Elijah	scunizi	Yup sure do - Thanks for the push, I am glad they have a portable version, I will be sure and thank the developer(s)
2008-10-28T07:55:00.000Z	scunizi	Elijah	nothing fully emulates IE.. not even IE5lin
2008-10-28T07:58:00.000Z	scunizi	Elijah	that's because it requires directx and probably some custom asp programming.. I go to several sites like that and as a result need windows installed in a VM.  Makes me mad but not much to do about it.
2008-10-28T08:00:00.000Z	scunizi	Elijah	remember win2k & pro don't need activation for installation in a vm
2008-10-28T08:01:00.000Z	Elijah	scunizi	All they have is an upgrade disk and the OS boot drive just failed big time (loud noises), can't even buy Pro anymore can you?
2008-10-28T08:02:00.000Z	Elijah	scunizi	I did not know pro and 2000 didnt need activation in a VM though! Thank
2008-10-28T08:05:00.000Z	scunizi	Elijah	that is win2kpro
2008-10-28T08:14:00.000Z	Elijah	scunizi	What is the shred program for then?
2008-10-28T08:15:00.000Z	scunizi	Elijah	shred?  or shared?
2008-10-28T08:15:00.000Z	Elijah	scunizi	Isn't there a shred or tear or something like program?
2008-10-28T08:16:00.000Z	scunizi	Elijah	for erasing things on the HD?
2008-10-28T08:17:00.000Z	scunizi	Elijah	yea there are.. milspec in fact. overwrites with 0's 3+ times to insure .. but for the life of me I can't remember the name
2008-10-28T08:17:00.000Z	scunizi	Elijah	I have no idea.. never used it
2008-10-28T08:18:00.000Z	scunizi	Elijah	could be
2008-10-28T08:19:00.000Z	scunizi	Elijah	don't forget ~/.thumbnails  pics of most everything
