2009-05-17T00:03:00.000Z	Mack_	ikonia	you know how to make it so that it sends the email AFTER it loads the page?
2009-05-17T00:03:00.000Z	ikonia	Mack_	email and a web page have nothing to do with each other
2009-05-17T00:03:00.000Z	ikonia	Mack_	they are seperate programs
2009-05-17T00:04:00.000Z	ikonia	Mack_	sendmail has nothing to do with apacke
2009-05-17T00:04:00.000Z	ikonia	Mack_	register what ?
2009-05-17T00:04:00.000Z	Mack_	ikonia	wordpress/forum/movabletype
2009-05-17T00:05:00.000Z	ikonia	Mack_	you need to work with wordpress code
2009-05-17T00:06:00.000Z	Mack_	ikonia	you use sendmail to send messages from like a blog or something?
2009-05-17T00:07:00.000Z	ikonia	Mack_	yes, but the php in wordpress dicates how that works
2009-05-17T00:08:00.000Z	Mack_	ikonia	mine is REALLY slow though
2009-05-17T00:08:00.000Z	ikonia	Mack_	as I said, thats nothing to do with apache/sendmail, that's wordpress having a dependency
2009-05-17T00:08:00.000Z	ikonia	Mack_	the only thing you can do outside wordpress is reduce the time it takes to send a mail
2009-05-17T00:08:00.000Z	Mack_	ikonia	i mean its slow from everything
2009-05-17T00:09:00.000Z	Mack_	ikonia	yeah, thats what i mean, it takes forever to send the message
2009-05-17T00:09:00.000Z	ikonia	Mack_	ok, so look at why your mail server is slow
2009-05-17T00:09:00.000Z	Mack_	ikonia	what would cause it to be so slow?
2009-05-17T00:10:00.000Z	ikonia	Mack_	tons of things, DNS is a common one, network bandwidth, reverse lookup, routing
2009-05-17T00:11:00.000Z	Mack_	ikonia	ok i have 5mbps upload, "unlimited" bandwith, and idk about the other two
2009-05-17T00:11:00.000Z	ikonia	Mack_	do a helo local send on your mail server, see where/why it is slow
2009-05-17T00:13:00.000Z	Mack_	ikonia	ok, im a bit of a noob w/ this, do i just type mail, or sendmail
2009-05-17T00:15:00.000Z	Mack_	ikonia	how do i do a local send?
