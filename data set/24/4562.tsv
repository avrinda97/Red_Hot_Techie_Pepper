2007-04-08T06:46:00.000Z	tbuss		I have mounted a external hdd with ntfs-3g everything works as advertised but cannot share files located on hdd
2007-04-08T06:48:00.000Z	tbuss		is it possible to share files with samba if the files are located on a external hdd
2007-04-08T06:48:00.000Z	thechitowncubs	tbuss	yes of course
2007-04-08T06:49:00.000Z	tbuss	thechitowncubs	I have been trying for two weeks to get this to work
2007-04-08T06:49:00.000Z	thechitowncubs	tbuss	SMB is a bitch, are you sharing to windows comp?
2007-04-08T06:50:00.000Z	tbuss	thechitowncubs	could you take a look here http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14376/
2007-04-08T06:51:00.000Z	thechitowncubs	tbuss	use NFS
2007-04-08T06:51:00.000Z	thechitowncubs	tbuss	if you are sharing between LINUX comps, never use SMB
2007-04-08T06:51:00.000Z	tbuss	thechitowncubs	I was told it was easier to use smb
2007-04-08T06:52:00.000Z	thechitowncubs	tbuss	i disagree
2007-04-08T06:52:00.000Z	tbuss	thechitowncubs	If I use NFS will I need to format the external hdd?
2007-04-08T06:52:00.000Z	thechitowncubs	tbuss	not if linux can read it
2007-04-08T06:53:00.000Z	thechitowncubs	tbuss	your working with NTFS?
2007-04-08T06:53:00.000Z	tbuss	thechitowncubs	I installed ntfs-3g on the external

2007-04-08T06:53:00.000Z	thechitowncubs	tbuss	can you read the files through local comp?
2007-04-08T06:53:00.000Z	tbuss	thechitowncubs	yes, read and write
2007-04-08T06:54:00.000Z	thechitowncubs	tbuss	try NFS
2007-04-08T06:54:00.000Z	tbuss	thechitowncubs	okay, is there any reason why an external hard drive can't share files?
2007-04-08T06:55:00.000Z	thechitowncubs	tbuss	the external hard drive doesn't share files, its the computer that does that
2007-04-08T06:55:00.000Z	thechitowncubs	tbuss	it could be a TON of things
2007-04-08T06:56:00.000Z	tbuss	thechitowncubs	using ntfs-3g just uses fake permissions right, I'd have to configure actual permissions with mount options?
2007-04-08T06:57:00.000Z	tbuss	thechitowncubs	I'm going to take a look at the link you provided, appreciate your help
2007-04-08T06:57:00.000Z	thechitowncubs	tbuss	good luck :)
