2009-09-06T08:00:00.000Z	ctmjr	coilette	now you should reboot the computer to remove all traces of the ati driver
2009-09-06T07:46:00.000Z	ctmjr	coilette	where did you get the driver from?
2009-09-06T07:50:00.000Z	ctmjr	coilette	and you ran aticonfig --initial without any errors?
2009-09-06T07:52:00.000Z	coilette	ctmjr	it says there are no adapters detected
2009-09-06T07:55:00.000Z	ctmjr	coilette	ok we need to uninstall the driver you installed  go here cd  /usr/share/ati and run this to uninstall it sudo   sh ./fglrx-uninstall.sh
2009-09-06T08:05:00.000Z	coilette	ctmjr	im back, how do i install fglrx correctly?
2009-09-06T08:06:00.000Z	ctmjr	coilette	sudo apt-get update
2009-09-06T08:08:00.000Z	ctmjr	coilette	ok we are going to install the driver from the repos this part might give errors if it does we can fix sudo apt-get install linux-restricted-modules-$(`uname -r`)
2009-09-06T08:10:00.000Z	ctmjr	coilette	ok try removing the ` at the beginning and end of uname -r
2009-09-06T08:12:00.000Z	ctmjr	coilette	that's good now sudo apt-get install xorg-driver-fglrx
2009-09-06T08:15:00.000Z	coilette	ctmjr	im assuming this is the open source drivers?
2009-09-06T08:16:00.000Z	ctmjr	coilette	well that explains alot you had 2 versions of the same driver installed try this sudo apt-get --purge remove xorg-driver-fglrx then sudo apt get install xorg-driver-fglrx
2009-09-06T08:17:00.000Z	ctmjr	coilette	no it's an older version of the ati fglrx driver should be more stable
2009-09-06T08:18:00.000Z	coilette	ctmjr	so when i reboot vega strike wont nexuiz wont run like crap?
2009-09-06T08:19:00.000Z	ctmjr	coilette	that's the plan
2009-09-06T08:21:00.000Z	coilette	ctmjr	okay somethings messed up.. "The program 'fglrxinfo' is currently not installed.  You can install it by typing: sudo apt-get install xorg-driver-fglrx" ... "xorg-driver-fglrx is already the newest version."
2009-09-06T08:22:00.000Z	coilette	ctmjr	should i reinstall it?
2009-09-06T08:23:00.000Z	ctmjr	coilette	did you run apt-get --purge remove then apt-get install?
2009-09-06T08:27:00.000Z	ctmjr	coilette	did it install for you?
2009-09-06T08:29:00.000Z	ctmjr	coilette	ok now run these 3 commands and reboot sudo depmod -a / sudo aticonfig --initial / sudo aticonfig --overlay-type=Xv
2009-09-06T08:38:00.000Z	ctmjr	coilette	these have to be run before rebooting  you can run them from the terminal your in sudo depmod -a / sudo aticonfig --initial / sudo aticonfig --overlay-type=Xv
2009-09-06T08:39:00.000Z	ctmjr	coilette	your getting ahead of the game
2009-09-06T08:45:00.000Z	ctmjr	coilette	did you run these commands yet?  sudo depmod -a / sudo aticonfig --initial / sudo aticonfig --overlay-type=Xv
