2009-01-18T14:41:00.000Z	transporter	baz	all i need is a good diary software wherein i could write my daily thoughts and feelings
2009-01-18T14:42:00.000Z	baz	transporter	so lets start by u telling me why a wordprocessor wouldnt do?
2009-01-18T14:42:00.000Z	baz	transporter	ever seen "basket"
2009-01-18T14:42:00.000Z	transporter	baz	no
2009-01-18T14:43:00.000Z	baz	transporter	its like onenote for microsoft - but i would say even better - easy to organize, can be done by date, etc.
2009-01-18T14:43:00.000Z	transporter	baz	ok but what is it?
2009-01-18T14:44:00.000Z	baz	transporter	its an application for kde that allows u to write notes, documents, but a lot more - google it, i think u will like it
2009-01-18T14:44:00.000Z	transporter	baz	what is it again basket?
2009-01-18T14:45:00.000Z	baz	transporter	yeah >> http://basket.kde.org/
2009-01-18T14:45:00.000Z	transporter	baz	but i have hardy
2009-01-18T14:46:00.000Z	transporter	baz	having hardy will it be a problem?
2009-01-18T14:46:00.000Z	baz	transporter	thats ok... even tho hardy, by default, uses gnome as a window manager, it doesn't mean you can't use kde apps - it will download a few more files the first time - but it will run just fine
2009-01-18T14:47:00.000Z	baz	transporter	many people use amarok, which is a kde app, even tho they are on gnome - there is a big difference between using kde for apps and kde as the entire window manager
2009-01-18T14:48:00.000Z	baz	transporter	unles u are ridiculously short on hard-drive space, there is almost no reason not to use a kde app u like
2009-01-18T14:48:00.000Z	transporter	baz	thanx a lot really appreciate it :D
2009-01-18T14:48:00.000Z	transporter	baz	one question would be can u use smileys in this

2009-01-18T14:49:00.000Z	transporter	baz	can u use smileys in this app
2009-01-18T14:50:00.000Z	baz	transporter	hehe, i'm not sure exactly - u mean do characters get transofrmed into little gif images of faces? probably not, i don't have it installed at the moment
2009-01-18T14:50:00.000Z	transporter	baz	my question was could it be possible
2009-01-18T14:52:00.000Z	baz	transporter	probably, but i'm not sure
