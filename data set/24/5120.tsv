2006-10-22T08:32:00.000Z	deadhobo	LjL	sorry it took so long, here is my sources.list
2006-10-22T08:36:00.000Z	LjL	deadhobo	make it look like this: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/27814/    then run "sudo apt-get --purge remove nvidia-glx", then "sudo apt-get clean", then "sudo apt-get update", then "sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx"
2006-10-22T08:36:00.000Z	LjL	deadhobo	however, also read the channel topic.
2006-10-22T08:40:00.000Z	LjL	deadhobo	mind you, i was talking about the nvidia exploit warning
2006-10-22T08:40:00.000Z	deadhobo	LjL	Exploit?
2006-10-22T08:41:00.000Z	LjL	deadhobo	WARNING: nvidia driver has a security problem with a hotfix available from nvidia here: http://www.nvidia.com/object/unix.html <---- this can be exploited
2006-10-22T08:41:00.000Z	LjL	deadhobo	and don't ask me what's the correct way to apply the fix -- haven't done it
2006-10-22T08:42:00.000Z	deadhobo	LjL	lol, ok. thanks for the link... after I finish making my sources.list match I'll look into that
2006-10-22T08:49:00.000Z	deadhobo	LjL	Thanks, I ran the commands and edited sources.list. Is it all set now?
2006-10-22T08:50:00.000Z	LjL	deadhobo	i don't know. i was just hoping that installing the official version of the nvidia driver, rather than the one installed by Automatix (whatever version it is), will solve your problem.
2006-10-22T08:50:00.000Z	LjL	deadhobo	now you may try running "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg" again, select the "nvidia" driver, and see if this time it works.
2006-10-22T08:50:00.000Z	LjL	deadhobo	if it still doesn't, then *shrug*, i dunno
2006-10-22T08:51:00.000Z	deadhobo	LjL	Allrighty, I'll try that. At least now I know how to fix it :D
2006-10-22T09:05:00.000Z	LjL	deadhobo	if you're using the nvidia driver, you should see a white screen with the NVidia logo when X starts
2006-10-22T09:06:00.000Z	deadhobo	LjL	I didn't see it :/ Under applications there is a nvidia settings thing though
2006-10-22T09:07:00.000Z	LjL	deadhobo	type "grep nvidia /etc/X11/xorg.conf" -- does it output anything?
2006-10-22T09:08:00.000Z	deadhobo	LjL	No
2006-10-22T09:08:00.000Z	LjL	deadhobo	then you're still using the "nv" driver. either you've not selected "nvidia" in the dpkg-reconfigure, or... dunno
2006-10-22T09:08:00.000Z	deadhobo	LjL	lol, probably an error on my part. I'll try configuring again
2006-10-22T09:09:00.000Z	LjL	deadhobo	try just opening /etc/X11/xorg.conf with a text editor and changing the line that reads Driver "nv" into Driver "nvidia", and then ctrl+alt+backspace to restart X
2006-10-22T09:12:00.000Z	deadhobo	LjL	I edited it, but gedit won't let me save it... I'm assuming thats because I am not root?
2006-10-22T09:13:00.000Z	LjL	deadhobo	good assumption. use "gksudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf" to edit it
2006-10-22T09:18:00.000Z	deadhobo	LjL	I restarted X and the same thing happened as my original problem... I think that driver must not be compatible with my videocard or something.
2006-10-29T10:26:00.000Z	deadhobo	LjL	I know... we have been over this :p. It's not automatix's fault, trust me
