2007-08-12T11:23:00.000Z	manduski	dystopianray	how do i restart the server?
2007-08-12T11:13:00.000Z	dystopianray	manduski	your isp may block port 22
2007-08-12T11:14:00.000Z	manduski	dystopianray	i tried changing the external port to 500 and changed putty for port 500 and still nothing
2007-08-12T11:15:00.000Z	dystopianray	manduski	i suspect it is an error in how you've set it up
2007-08-12T11:22:00.000Z	manduski	dystopianray	I modified my /etc/ssh/ssh_config file for port 443 and still nothing =(
2007-08-12T11:23:00.000Z	dystopianray	manduski	did you restart the server?
2007-08-12T11:24:00.000Z	dystopianray	manduski	sudo /etc/init.d/ssh restart
2007-08-12T11:25:00.000Z	manduski	dystopianray	restarted server, tried it again and "server unexpectedly closed network connection"
2007-08-12T11:26:00.000Z	dystopianray	manduski	use nmap on your external ip to see if the port is open
2007-08-12T11:28:00.000Z	manduski	dystopianray	I've never used nmap (but i do have it on my comp) could you show me what commands do what?
2007-08-12T11:28:00.000Z	dystopianray	manduski	nmap -P0 -p 443 <your-external-ip>
2007-08-12T11:31:00.000Z	manduski	dystopianray	it says "PORT 443/tcp, STATE open SERVICES https
2007-08-12T11:32:00.000Z	manduski	dystopianray	it says "PORT 443/tcp, STATE open SERVICES https
2007-08-12T11:37:00.000Z	dystopianray	manduski	sounds like the port is open
2007-08-12T11:37:00.000Z	manduski	dystopianray	so what could be going wrong?
2007-08-12T11:37:00.000Z	dystopianray	manduski	hrrm not sure
2007-08-12T11:37:00.000Z	manduski	dystopianray	it's telling me "server unexpectedly closed network connection" does that mean that the problem lies with the computer i'm trying to SSH into, not the router?
2007-08-12T11:37:00.000Z	dystopianray	manduski	hrrm, i'm not exactly sure at this point, the server is working fine on your internal lan
2007-08-12T12:35:00.000Z	dystopianray	manduski	get a different ISP
2007-08-12T12:37:00.000Z	dystopianray	manduski	move to a different country
2007-08-12T12:38:00.000Z	dystopianray	manduski	move to australia
2007-08-13T10:14:00.000Z	manduski	dystopianray	can you see if you can SSH into my computer at my friends house?
2007-08-13T10:17:00.000Z	dystopianray	manduski	still having trouble?
2007-08-13T10:17:00.000Z	manduski	dystopianray	yeah
