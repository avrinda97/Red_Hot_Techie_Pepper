2006-12-10T10:28:00.000Z	what_if		ok, found the problem... I have 2 soundcards... for _some_ reason it detected my soudcards differently on this boot (swapped 1 and 0)
2006-12-10T10:28:00.000Z	guerrero	what_if	is one of them a usb camera?
2006-12-10T10:29:00.000Z	what_if	guerrero	no, one of my soundcards is not a usb camera
2006-12-10T10:30:00.000Z	guerrero	what_if	I'm not sure you need to...cant you just select the card in prefences -> sound
2006-12-10T10:30:00.000Z	guerrero	what_if	 system-> prefs-> sound
2006-12-10T10:30:00.000Z	guerrero	what_if	"Default Sound card"
2006-12-10T10:32:00.000Z	what_if	guerrero	i'm gonna try rebooting and see if the soundcards are detected as normal this time :)
2006-12-10T10:39:00.000Z	what_if	guerrero	ok, I rebooted and now the cards have swapped addresses again, how do I make them _not_ do this?
2006-12-10T10:39:00.000Z	guerrero	what_if	did you set your default sound card in the prefs?
2006-12-10T10:40:00.000Z	guerrero	what_if	by the way, you dont need to completely reboot...in a terminal do "sudo init 1"  that will bring you run level 1...then go back to run level 5 by tying "init 5"
2006-12-10T10:40:00.000Z	what_if	guerrero	yes, default sound card set
2006-12-10T10:40:00.000Z	what_if	guerrero	nice
2006-12-10T10:40:00.000Z	guerrero	what_if	so the default sound card is correct and you get no sound?
2006-12-10T10:41:00.000Z	guerrero	what_if	now try typing "alsamixer" on the command line...use the arrows to pump up all the volumes
2006-12-10T10:41:00.000Z	what_if	guerrero	no i get sound, I just have to change the settings on every program to point to the other soundcard everytime
2006-12-10T10:41:00.000Z	guerrero	what_if	negative...default sound card should do it
2006-12-10T10:42:00.000Z	what_if	guerrero	most of my programs use a hardware address
2006-12-10T10:42:00.000Z	guerrero	what_if	oh..hmm...like /dev/dsp?
2006-12-10T10:44:00.000Z	what_if	guerrero	like hw:0,0 or /dev/dsp1
2006-12-10T10:45:00.000Z	guerrero	what_if	hmm..not sure...Maybe you can change swap the sound card pci slots
2006-12-10T10:45:00.000Z	what_if	guerrero	one is onboard....
2006-12-10T10:45:00.000Z	what_if	guerrero	mabey if i manually load one of the modules first ?
2006-12-10T10:46:00.000Z	guerrero	what_if	you have exhausted my expertise
2006-12-10T10:47:00.000Z	what_if	guerrero	this is an odd problem... tnx for your help :)
