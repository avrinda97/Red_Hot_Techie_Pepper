2005-11-02T11:21:00.000Z	nagual		Can someone take a look at my smb.conf file and tell me why it isn't showing up in my view workgroup computers in win xp?
2005-11-02T11:23:00.000Z	nagual		Can someone take a look at my smb.conf file and tell me why my ubuntu box  isn't showing up in my view workgroup computers in win xp?
2005-11-02T11:24:00.000Z	nagual		ok.  hold on
2005-11-02T11:25:00.000Z	nagual		ok bob2:  it is here http://nagual.homelinux.net/smb.conf
2005-11-02T11:27:00.000Z	x86i	nagual	can you ping either of the box's?
2005-11-02T11:34:00.000Z	x86i	nagual	Have you restarted samba since you edited your config?
2005-11-02T11:35:00.000Z	x86i	nagual	also make sure you dont have any firewall software running on either machine
2005-11-02T11:37:00.000Z	x86i	nagual	also, uncomment this line in the config name resolve order
2005-11-02T11:39:00.000Z	nagual	x86i	still nothin.  Why would the 2 windows boxes be able to ping eachother, but not see eachother in the view workgroup computers?  I think if I could solve this problem I could fix the samba problem.
2005-11-02T11:40:00.000Z	x86i	nagual	both of the windows boxes have file and printer sharing enabled.
2005-11-02T11:41:00.000Z	nagual	x86i	yes
2005-11-02T11:41:00.000Z	x86i	nagual	and have been rebooted since being added to that workgroup?
2005-11-02T11:41:00.000Z	nagual	x86i	yes
2005-11-02T11:42:00.000Z	x86i	nagual	hrm. wait a sec, do you have anything shared on the windows boxes?
2005-11-02T11:42:00.000Z	nagual	x86i	no.  let me share something quick.  see if it helps
2005-11-02T11:43:00.000Z	nagual	x86i	shouldn't there be some default widnows shares?
2005-11-02T11:43:00.000Z	x86i	nagual	Yes, in windows you have to share something, otherwise nothing will show
2005-11-02T11:44:00.000Z	nagual	x86i	 didn't work.
2005-11-02T11:44:00.000Z	x86i	nagual	open up My Computer, and goto Tools
2005-11-02T11:45:00.000Z	x86i	nagual	then goto options
2005-11-02T11:45:00.000Z	x86i	nagual	then goto View, scroll down and check the box for simple file sharing, then re-do the file share you just did.
2005-11-02T11:48:00.000Z	nagual	x86i	its already checked
2005-11-02T11:49:00.000Z	x86i	nagual	re check it, the only thing I can think of is the sharing info is messed up
2005-11-02T11:49:00.000Z	x86i	nagual	and sadly theres no way to 'repair' windows the easy way
