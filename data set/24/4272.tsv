2007-05-20T16:46:00.000Z	ianm		seems wireless stopped working with 2.6.20-15-386 and orinoco_cs , anyone seen this?
2007-05-20T16:47:00.000Z	ianm		(with network-manager, the card's light comes on meaning it sees the AP, but network-manager doesn't show the network)
2007-05-20T05:49:00.000Z	ianm		arg, so does feisty not have a linux-source package for anything but the latest??  I need to get the source for the latest kernel that runs for me (2.6.15) so I can compile TrueCrypt (right now I can't get at my files!!)
2007-05-20T05:50:00.000Z	stefg	ianm	uhoh... feisty on 2.6.15 kernel is asking for trouble.... don't do it, if you ask me
2007-05-20T05:50:00.000Z	ianm	stefg	anything newer breaks my wireless
2007-05-20T05:51:00.000Z	stefg	ianm	so stick with dapper
2007-05-20T05:51:00.000Z	ianm	stefg	a bit late for that...
2007-05-20T05:51:00.000Z	ianm	stefg	but how can I get the kernel source for 2.6.15?
2007-05-20T05:52:00.000Z	stefg	ianm	kernel.org
2007-05-20T05:52:00.000Z	ianm	stefg	but then it wouldn't have ubuntu patches..?
2007-05-20T05:52:00.000Z	stefg	ianm	what a relief :-)
2007-05-20T05:54:00.000Z	ianm	stefg	so I can't use anything newer than 2.6.15, all my files are in a truecrypt file, there are no truecrypt modules that work with this kernel, so I have to compile it, and the sources aren't available
2007-05-20T05:54:00.000Z	stefg	ianm	seriously.... don't. if you have to run 2.6.15 (for whatever reason) stick to dapper. restore a backup, reinstall dapper, whatever. there's libata and upstart in edgy/feisty and this will have consequences when running a to old kernel
2007-05-20T05:55:00.000Z	ianm	stefg	it seems to work fine besides that I can't get a truecrypt module loaded.  I really don't have the option to go to dapper.  I have no install media, I have terribly slow internet access
2007-05-20T05:57:00.000Z	stefg	ianm	so you have to use pinning, and get the dapper sources in your your sources.list to have access to the dapper kernel sources. this is such a mess, don't do it. if you really want trouble get the !pinning factoid from the bot
2007-05-20T05:58:00.000Z	ianm	stefg	do I have any other option?  can I just download a tar.gz of the sources from 2.6.15 ?  I agree changing sources back is ugly
2007-05-20T06:00:00.000Z	stefg	ianm	yup, if you know how to build a kernel the debian/ubuntu-way there's nothing wrong with it... just make sure to use kpkg. BTW i never run the stock-kernel and alway use the kernel.org-sources with my own patch-set
2007-05-20T06:01:00.000Z	ianm	stefg	the debian way, no I've never had to do it.  the pure way yes, a long time ago
2007-05-20T06:01:00.000Z	ianm	stefg	but I don't think I have to build the kernel, just have the source tree so I can compile truecrypt against it
2007-05-20T06:03:00.000Z	ianm	stefg	do you know how to download a tar.gz of the ubuntu 2.6.15 source?
2007-05-20T06:06:00.000Z	stefg	ianm	http://packages.ubuntu.com/dapper/devel/linux-source-2.6.15
2007-05-20T06:11:00.000Z	ianm	stefg	thanks.  is this the file I need?  http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/l/linux-source-2.6.15/linux-source-2.6.15_2.6.15.orig.tar.gz
2007-05-20T06:11:00.000Z	stefg	ianm	looks like it
2007-05-20T06:21:00.000Z	stefg	ianm	lol... briliant catch ! :-)
