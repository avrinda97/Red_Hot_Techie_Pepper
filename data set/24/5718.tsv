2006-05-17T12:38:00.000Z	jksd		is it OK to ask a general UNIX question in here?
2006-05-17T12:38:00.000Z	jksd		alright
2006-05-17T12:38:00.000Z	jksd		well
2006-05-17T12:39:00.000Z	jksd		what would be better for a shell server, solaris or red hat?
2006-05-17T12:39:00.000Z	jksd		is solaris OK for beginners?
2006-05-17T12:39:00.000Z	tahorg	jksd	on sparc ?
2006-05-17T12:39:00.000Z	jksd	tahorg	yeah it would be on a SPARC if it's solaris
2006-05-17T12:40:00.000Z	tahorg	jksd	well opensolaris works on i386
2006-05-17T12:40:00.000Z	tahorg	jksd	that's why I asked
2006-05-17T12:40:00.000Z	tahorg	jksd	but it depends on what you want to do on those servers
2006-05-17T12:40:00.000Z	jksd	tahorg	a few things I guess
2006-05-17T12:41:00.000Z	tahorg	jksd	bash/zsh/sh/tcsh just work on both
2006-05-17T12:41:00.000Z	tahorg	jksd	ubuntu is a good choice btw :)
2006-05-17T12:42:00.000Z	tahorg	jksd	enterprise server $$$
2006-05-17T12:42:00.000Z	jksd	tahorg	I know
2006-05-17T12:43:00.000Z	tahorg	jksd	what training ?
2006-05-17T12:43:00.000Z	tahorg	jksd	just bash scripting ?
2006-05-17T12:43:00.000Z	jksd	tahorg	red hat offers sysadmin training
2006-05-17T12:44:00.000Z	tahorg	jksd	I don't understand your question then, you want a sysadmin training ok
2006-05-17T12:44:00.000Z	jksd	tahorg	yeah I do want to
2006-05-17T12:44:00.000Z	tahorg	jksd	but redhat and solaris a really different
2006-05-17T12:44:00.000Z	jksd	tahorg	right
2006-05-17T12:45:00.000Z	jksd	tahorg	red hat is better because I'm a beginner, right?
2006-05-17T12:46:00.000Z	tahorg	jksd	if it's for your own formation, try different distro and solaris and a bsd
