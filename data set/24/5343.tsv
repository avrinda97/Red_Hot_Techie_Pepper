2006-08-12T13:49:00.000Z	rast4		maybe I'll do a reinstall again and skip the Automatix
2006-08-12T13:49:00.000Z	rast4		see if that is the problem. At least that *might* isolate the problem
2006-08-12T13:49:00.000Z	paotzu	rast4	what happened with automatix
2006-08-12T13:50:00.000Z	paotzu	rast4	grub hangs?
2006-08-12T13:50:00.000Z	paotzu	rast4	where does is hang?
2006-08-12T13:51:00.000Z	paotzu	rast4	did you try ctrl-alt-f1 to see if you can get a command line?
2006-08-12T13:52:00.000Z	paotzu	rast4	what kind of video card do you have?
2006-08-12T13:55:00.000Z	rast4	paotzu	any ideas?
2006-08-12T13:55:00.000Z	paotzu	rast4	something might be wrong with the video configuration in xorg.conf
2006-08-12T13:56:00.000Z	paotzu	rast4	I had a similar problem, but I could do ctrl-alt-f1 and get a command line
2006-08-12T13:56:00.000Z	paotzu	rast4	that's it
2006-08-12T13:57:00.000Z	paotzu	rast4	try booting and using ctrl-alt-f1 and ctrl-alt-f2 to get some command lines
2006-08-12T13:58:00.000Z	paotzu	rast4	you should be able to do that where it hangs
2006-08-12T13:58:00.000Z	paotzu	rast4	there were some lines for the ati driver that caused a full system hang... but that can't be your problem
2006-08-12T14:10:00.000Z	paotzu	rast4	if you look on ubuntuforums.org there is a bunch of stuff about getting nvidia cards past system hang
2006-08-12T14:15:00.000Z	paotzu	rast4	have you tried entering in recovery mode and then apt-getting the nvidia driver again
2006-08-12T14:16:00.000Z	rast4	paotzu	I haven't simply because I'm unsure of how to do that, but I'd be grateful if you could help me or point in the right direction
2006-08-12T14:17:00.000Z	paotzu	rast4	sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx nvidia-kernel-common;sudo nvidia-glx-config enable
2006-08-12T14:20:00.000Z	rast4	paotzu	it says nvidia-glx is already the newest version
2006-08-12T14:24:00.000Z	paotzu	rast4	you might try this guy's script: http://www.albertomilone.eu/europeo/nvidia_scripts1.html
2006-08-12T14:25:00.000Z	rast4	paotzu	how would I run it if I can't boot?
2006-08-12T14:28:00.000Z	paotzu	rast4	then it won't load the splash screen
2006-08-12T14:44:00.000Z	paotzu	rast4	installed the nvidia driver, he gets a common error when trying to do the nvidia-glx-config
2006-08-12T14:46:00.000Z	paotzu	rast4	try what macd just said
