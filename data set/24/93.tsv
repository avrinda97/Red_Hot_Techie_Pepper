2012-11-04T23:54:00.000Z	FlowRiser	Mark__	next to your username should be a small button, press it and select unity-2d
2012-11-04T23:55:00.000Z	Mark__	FlowRiser	He needs refit to boot
2012-11-04T23:56:00.000Z	FlowRiser	Mark__	is refit only for macintosh ?

2012-11-04T23:58:00.000Z	FlowRiser	Mark__	hmm, what desktop environment are you using ?
2012-11-04T23:58:00.000Z	FlowRiser	Mark__	it is right next to your username then in the right side the canonical logo
2012-11-04T23:59:00.000Z	FlowRiser	Mark__	odd, you need to go into recovery mode and set it manually
2012-11-05T00:00:00.000Z	FlowRiser	Mark__	you need to change the user-session to unity-2d manually, i can't really recall how i did it last time
