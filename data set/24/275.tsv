2012-01-06T07:49:00.000Z	vreg		i installed slackware to a usb stick but without a bootloader, can i do this (except for step 10): http://www.pendrivelinux.com/install-grub2-on-usb-from-ubuntu-linux/
2012-01-06T07:50:00.000Z	vreg		i just need to stick a bootloader on there i guess
2012-01-06T07:50:00.000Z	vreg		don't even need it to get into the mbr
2012-01-06T07:50:00.000Z	vreg		i'll go into the grub2 prompt from there to boot slackware
2012-01-06T07:52:00.000Z	vreg		could someone verify that the list of steps is correct? except for step 10 of course
2012-01-06T07:54:00.000Z	urlin2u	vreg	boots your OS . http://www.pendrivelinux.com/boot-multiple-iso-from-usb-via-grub2-using-linux/
2012-01-06T07:56:00.000Z	vreg	urlin2u	can i get the ubuntu livecd to install grub2 to the usb stick that has slackware installed?
2012-01-06T07:57:00.000Z	vreg	urlin2u	grub2 to its own usb stick sounds nice, but it'd be ideal-ish if i could get it on the stick with slackware
2012-01-06T07:57:00.000Z	vreg		i'd actually prefer not to write grub2 to mbr
2012-01-06T07:58:00.000Z	vreg		as long as i can get a grub2 prompt (on the same stick as slackware), that's cool
2012-01-06T07:58:00.000Z	vreg		i don't mind starting linux up manually
2012-01-06T08:07:00.000Z	urlin2u	vreg	I don't try loading grub unless I know the OS has grub, I use this appt it has room for many IS at one time, not worth the effort otherwise for me if possible.
2012-01-06T08:07:00.000Z	urlin2u		IS=OS
2012-01-06T08:14:00.000Z	vreg	urlin2u	i'm not sure i understand
2012-01-06T08:15:00.000Z	urlin2u	vreg	I'm not sure your distro even has grub, trying to get it to boot with it like your doing for me is a waste of time when apps like the multiloader or even unetbootin will load it, not sure about unetbootin thouf=gh.
2012-01-06T08:16:00.000Z	urlin2u	vreg	I don't know how in your situation as well.
2012-01-06T08:16:00.000Z	vreg		grub(2) works with almost every linux distro though right?
2012-01-06T08:17:00.000Z	vreg		and unetbootin is kind of... not the best thing to do long term
2012-01-06T08:18:00.000Z	urlin2u	vreg	if setup correctly it has files in the os and the mbr not just the mbr, and you have a situation that has nothing to do with ubuntu, it's cd wont load it try ##linux
2012-01-06T08:19:00.000Z	vreg	urlin2u	incorrect
2012-01-06T08:20:00.000Z	urlin2u	vreg	excellent you can spell.
2012-01-06T08:22:00.000Z	urlin2u	vreg	http://www.slackware.com/install/  slackware uses lilo.
2012-01-06T08:22:00.000Z	vreg		yup it does
2012-01-06T08:23:00.000Z	urlin2u	vreg	http://www.slackbook.org/html/booting.html this might help, not sure, but you will probably not get much help here, this is ubuntu support, you can keep trying if it suits you.
