2010-11-12T06:49:00.000Z	pitlimit		I want to dual boot windows 7 and ubuntu... but i'd like to share hard drive space
2010-11-12T06:50:00.000Z	pitlimit		can anyone tell me how i might do this?
2010-11-12T06:50:00.000Z	pitlimit		hm
2010-11-12T06:50:00.000Z	pitlimit		two answers!
2010-11-12T06:51:00.000Z	pitlimit		oh that's weird
2010-11-12T06:51:00.000Z	pitlimit		i thought people do it al the time
2010-11-12T06:51:00.000Z	greezmunkey	pitlimit	the easiest (safest for your win7) is a WUBI install, goog that 'ubuntu wubi install'
2010-11-12T06:52:00.000Z	greezmunkey	pitlimit	safe because you install within win7. If you decide it works with your hardware, etc. you can dig in deeped, and repartition.
2010-11-12T06:53:00.000Z	pitlimit	greezmunkey	you mean for the sharing of the partitions, right?
2010-11-12T06:54:00.000Z	greezmunkey	pitlimit	kind of. you would create a partition for win7, and some seperate ones for ubuntu. Then there is the whole partition resizing thing...
2010-11-12T06:54:00.000Z	pitlimit	greezmunkey	i read that it will do it for me?
2010-11-12T06:55:00.000Z	pitlimit	greezmunkey	i really don't understand what you're saying
2010-11-12T06:56:00.000Z	greezmunkey	pitlimit	do your homework first! Back up your win7 partition second.
2010-11-12T06:56:00.000Z	greezmunkey	pitlimit	what doing your homework on partitioning, and / or backing up your win7 partition???
2010-11-12T06:56:00.000Z	pitlimit	greezmunkey	you really aren't making sense
2010-11-12T06:57:00.000Z	greezmunkey	pitlimit	do you know how to manipulate partitions on a computer?
2010-11-12T06:59:00.000Z	greezmunkey	pitlimit	ok, then all you need to read up on is what partition requirements ubuntu requires (so much for the homework), next, and before you do any of it, back up your win7 partition. That's it!
2010-11-12T07:00:00.000Z	greezmunkey	pitlimit	I suggested wubi so that you can try it out on your PC. If that goes well, and everything works you should be able to confidently set it up on a dedicated partition.
2010-11-12T07:01:00.000Z	pitlimit	greezmunkey	thanks
2010-11-12T07:04:00.000Z	greezmunkey	pitlimit	the cool thing about a wubi install is that you can get things set up on ubuntu without the pain of partitioning up front. Then back up your config files for use once you decide to partition and reinstall. That, and it lets you jump right in without the potential of destroying your win7 setup.
2010-11-12T07:04:00.000Z	pitlimit	greezmunkey	but as a regular linux user, I don't want the overhead that WUBI creates
2010-11-12T07:05:00.000Z	greezmunkey	pitlimit	I had to assume that you were not a regular linux user up front, for that I am sorry - but it does beg the question "why ask about it in the first place"...
2010-11-12T07:05:00.000Z	pitlimit	greezmunkey	do you even remember my question?
