2011-10-17T20:49:00.000Z	kibet		Im seriously about to smash the computer in half right now, so i need some help
2011-10-17T20:50:00.000Z	kibet		is there ANY logical explanation WHY 11.04 would think of re-installing grub2?
2011-10-17T20:51:00.000Z	kibet		10.10 has grub 2, 11.04 has grub 2, so if you find grub LEGACY while updating to 11.04, WHY THE HELL would you replace it with grub 2?

2011-10-17T20:56:00.000Z	Tenkawa	kibet	grub has a tendency to regenerate all the time
2011-10-17T20:57:00.000Z	kibet	Tenkawa	then is there any way to remove it just for a second, so i can boot back into my computer, so i can brick GRUB 2 instead?
