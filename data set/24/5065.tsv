2006-11-04T07:50:00.000Z	Err_		is this where i go for questions? i am a total newb from windows xp
2006-11-04T07:51:00.000Z	Err_		i've read a lot and i'm not getting anywhere with it...
2006-11-04T07:52:00.000Z	Err_		what about OS X? A lot of people can get the hang of it quickly. Do you feel ubuntu is better than os x?
2006-11-04T07:53:00.000Z	Err_		why do you think so madewokherd
2006-11-04T07:53:00.000Z	Err_		oh oops
2006-11-04T07:54:00.000Z	Err_		i'm trying to install ubuntu onto my windows xp machine, however the hard drive has only 40gb left out of 200gb, I thought that might be enough. But when I went to install it on the live ubuntu CD it goes to the partition portion and FREEZES. So I got GParted to try and create partitions that way, and when GParted scans my HD is FREEZES too!!!
2006-11-04T07:56:00.000Z	GaiaX11	Err_	Make a backup of your files ande personal docs. Reformat the disk and install win and linux all again.
2006-11-04T07:59:00.000Z	GaiaX11	Err_	Better to install win first. If you install Linux first, grub will disappear and you will have to install it again.
2006-11-04T08:00:00.000Z	GaiaX11	Err_	and i would make more room to linux, instead of win.
2006-11-04T08:00:00.000Z	Err_	GaiaX11	So if I want to dual-boot, must I use GParted? And then I partition it into 3 parts, correct? 5gb ext3, swap, and a big ext3. Then when I install linux will it goes to those 3 partitions?
2006-11-04T08:01:00.000Z	GaiaX11	Err_	what is your hd size?
2006-11-04T08:02:00.000Z	Err_	GaiaX11	200gb
2006-11-04T08:04:00.000Z	GaiaX11	Err_	give, say, 30 for win; 70 to linux and leave 100 free for testing other linux or other os systems, like bsd
2006-11-04T08:06:00.000Z	Err_	GaiaX11	what file system should i use for linux, main system? can windows read off of this (not fat32)?
2006-11-04T08:09:00.000Z	GaiaX11	Err_	make one partition to win (C); ubuntu will suggest you to make a / and a swap partition. Make a swap partition with the double of you RAM and give the rest to /   I would recommend you to use raiserfs for / and install Linux and then Win.
2006-11-04T08:10:00.000Z	Err_	GaiaX11	I heard it was a good idea to separate the root partition from the home partition, is that true?
2006-11-04T08:10:00.000Z	Err_	GaiaX11	That way there are 4 partitions, 1 for windows, 1 for /, 1 for swap, and 1 for /home
2006-11-04T08:11:00.000Z	GaiaX11	Err_	Yes. But if you have 70gb for Linux. The system will make a big home for you without the need of making it by hand
2006-11-04T08:14:00.000Z	Err_	GaiaX11	so you recommend installing w/ reiserFS and THEN installing windows?
2006-11-04T08:15:00.000Z	GaiaX11	Err_	first win and then linux with raiserfs for /
2006-11-04T08:17:00.000Z	GaiaX11	Err_	With gparted you can partition you whole hd.
2006-11-04T08:20:00.000Z	GaiaX11	Err_	if your win is XP then make a C ntfs; then create a swap and a / raiserfs. Or you can follow Flannel advise with is easier :-)
2006-11-04T08:37:00.000Z	GaiaX11	Err_	For Raiserfs see: http://www.namesys.com/
2007-02-14T07:03:00.000Z	GaiaX11	Err_	If you have a card which supports that. Do: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg and choose that :-)
