2007-09-03T09:20:00.000Z	Zemus		Is ndiswrapper found on the binary ubuntu cd?
2007-09-03T09:21:00.000Z	Zemus		Great. :/
2007-09-03T09:21:00.000Z	Pelo	Zemus	 yes ,  check in pool in restricted , under the N
2007-09-03T09:22:00.000Z	Zemus	Pelo	I have no idea how to "check in pool in restricted under the N", can you tell me?
2007-09-03T09:23:00.000Z	Pelo	Zemus	 browse the cd
2007-09-03T09:23:00.000Z	Zemus	Pelo	if it's already installed, I should be ok :P
2007-09-03T09:24:00.000Z	Pelo	Zemus	ndiswrapper does not install by default , because it is only rarely needed
2007-09-03T09:24:00.000Z	Zemus	Pelo	ok thanks :)
2007-09-04T05:24:00.000Z	Pelo	Zemus	 why are you making ndiswrapper ? there are deb files on the cd
2007-09-04T05:24:00.000Z	Zemus	Pelo	I didn't know that... well, just for the sake of learning, can you tell me what I'm doing wrong anyway? Or what I would have to do if there weren't deb files on the cd?
2007-09-04T05:25:00.000Z	Pelo	Zemus	 put the cd in the drive ,  you should get a msg asking you to add it to the repos, you can then install ndiswarpper from synaptic  , let me check the png to tell you what happened with the make
2007-09-04T05:26:00.000Z	Zemus	Pelo	thank you :D
2007-09-04T05:27:00.000Z	Pelo	Zemus	 for the make errors looks to me like you,re missing a butload of dependencies did you run ./configure first ?
2007-09-04T05:29:00.000Z	Zemus	Pelo	when I run ./configure, I get "bash: ./configure: No such file or directory"
2007-09-04T05:29:00.000Z	Pelo	Zemus	 you need to run ./configure from inside the unpacked folder with the souce code in it ,  and you need ot have installed  build-essential first
2007-09-04T05:30:00.000Z	Zemus	Pelo	I'm guessing I don't have build-essential installed :P
2007-09-04T05:31:00.000Z	Pelo	Zemus	  browse the cd and start it manualy,  ( by dbl clicking) ,   it 's in cd > pool > main > N
2007-09-04T06:29:00.000Z	Pelo	Zemus	 remove them ?
2007-09-04T06:42:00.000Z	Pelo	Zemus	 how did you load those drivers ?
2007-09-04T06:43:00.000Z	Zemus	Pelo	I followed the install file to the letter. One moment. I'll pastebin it for you.
2007-09-04T06:44:00.000Z	Pelo	Zemus	no need,  if you can figure out when in that howto you installed those invalid drivers I can possibly help you to remove them
2007-09-04T06:47:00.000Z	Pelo	Zemus	 try without the .inf
2007-09-04T07:38:00.000Z	Zemus	Pelo	nah, but breaking the rules every great once in a while never hurt anything ;)
2007-09-17T06:07:00.000Z	Pelo	Zemus	 no ask in #compiz-fusion
