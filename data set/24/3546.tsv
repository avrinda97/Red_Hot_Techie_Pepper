2008-01-05T05:44:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Malik_	What about running persistent mode off the cd and a usb stick until you get comfortable.. It wont be fast but it will work
2008-01-05T05:46:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Malik_	Put it in the drive and power up.. Your system is most likely ablet to boot to a cd
2008-01-05T05:46:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Malik_	If it does not boot.. then check bios/cmos for boot order
2008-01-05T05:48:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Malik_	Of course you need the standard livecd from ubuntu to run it...
2008-01-05T05:50:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Malik_	Are you in need of help with Ubuntu or not..
2008-01-05T05:51:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Malik_	Did you verify the md5 of your download before the burn.  Did you test to see if it boots on any other syste or hardware?
2008-01-05T05:51:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Malik_	Did you have the cd do a self test for errors, did you md5 the cd..
2008-01-05T05:53:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Malik_	How fast is this hardware... with only a 20 gig drive I suspect your system is not all that new.. How much ram.. if 256 only.. then how much is shared with the video card?
2008-01-05T05:53:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Malik_	What about cpu speed?
2008-01-05T05:54:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Malik_	The specs on your system...
2008-01-05T05:54:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Malik_	What make and model of hardware?
2008-01-05T05:55:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Malik_	If you cant answer simple questions then I cant help.. sorry
2008-01-05T05:56:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Malik_	What is the make and model of your compaq
2008-01-05T06:00:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Malik_	That comes standard with a 40 gig drive...  cpu is celeron 1.7
2008-01-05T06:04:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Malik_	I have no problem with it being a 20 gig drive..  I dont hink you can even get a 20 any more.. so he may have just stuck in an old one for you
2008-01-05T06:05:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Malik_	No, dont care about that.. but if you plan on dual booting.. you really will have an easier time if you reinstall windows first.
2008-01-05T06:07:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Malik_	Once you fix or reinstall windows then come back and we will help you install ubuntu.  When you install windows it would be best if you create a 10 gig partition and install to that, but if you cant, ubuntu can resize to down to 10 gig for you beofre it installs
2008-01-05T06:08:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Malik_	Click on start
2008-01-05T06:09:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Malik_	It will not install until it gets to a desktop icon where you will need to click an icon that clearly says INSTALL
