2005-12-07T13:41:00.000Z	eternalist		i dont know why, but that always bothered me and i kept turning it on myself lol
2005-12-07T13:42:00.000Z	gnomefreak	eternalist	i set it to come on on boot up because i cant stand having to type a long bunch of numbers and say oh hell that damn cap locks
2005-12-07T13:45:00.000Z	eternalist	gnomefreak	true, but it SHOULD be
2005-12-07T13:46:00.000Z	eternalist	gnomefreak	you can't expect people to try something that'll be hard lol
2005-12-07T13:46:00.000Z	gnomefreak	eternalist	your right it should be but than it would be called mircocrap :(
2005-12-07T13:46:00.000Z	eternalist	gnomefreak	it doesn't need to be difficult to be good.
2005-12-07T13:47:00.000Z	gnomefreak	eternalist	no it doesnt i agree and linux isnt really all that hard its just at first glace its like OMG what am i doing :(
2005-12-07T13:47:00.000Z	eternalist	gnomefreak	yea, and you try to teach people some shell commands, heck, they think DOS is complex, imagine the linux CLI

2005-12-07T13:48:00.000Z	eternalist	gnomefreak	im serious, at my school, i type netstat in a dos prompt and people think im hacking

2005-12-07T13:49:00.000Z	gnomefreak	eternalist	it took me 2 years to teach g/f about ipconfig in DOS now im gonna have to teach her ifconfig :(

2005-12-07T13:49:00.000Z	eternalist	gnomefreak	i think windows has winipcfg for a graphical version, which is probably easier to teach
