2007-08-05T10:24:00.000Z	macogw	Dr_willis	i think he wants the little script that makes the list
2007-08-05T10:50:00.000Z	macogw	Dr_willis	forgot the -r ?
2007-08-05T10:51:00.000Z	Dr_willis	macogw	 i was using mc and smbfuse i think.  missing the -r would not of just grabbed the directory names. and skipped the files.. wondering if it was some odd ownership issue
2007-08-05T10:52:00.000Z	Dr_willis	macogw	 i got dircetorys going 10 levels deep all mirrored fine. :) but not a single actual data file got copied also. :)
2007-08-05T10:52:00.000Z	macogw	Dr_willis	ok yes, weird
2007-11-26T23:44:00.000Z	Dr_willis	macogw	 gotta love the 'service' command.. it just saves you a little typing.. (or hate it - because its so nonstandard. )
2007-11-26T23:44:00.000Z	macogw	Dr_willis	you're name's not derek, right?
2008-02-10T12:40:00.000Z	macogw	Dr_willis	dont some of the counties just change time zones?
2008-02-21T18:07:00.000Z	macogw	Dr_willis	where are you?
2008-02-21T18:07:00.000Z	Dr_willis	macogw	 Indiana
2008-02-21T18:07:00.000Z	macogw	Dr_willis	do you switch time zones?
2008-02-21T18:08:00.000Z	Dr_willis	macogw	 indiana is so confused on that issue. we have some counties that Do, some dont, and so forth. We used to switch zones,, so we never changed our clocks.. Now  we got counties next to each other that have 1 hr differance in time.
2008-02-21T18:08:00.000Z	macogw	Dr_willis	which is your county?
2008-02-21T18:34:00.000Z	macogw	Dr_willis	neither have i
2008-02-21T18:47:00.000Z	macogw	Dr_willis	read that^
2008-02-21T18:48:00.000Z	Dr_willis	macogw	 for ext3 its ok. :) niot ntfs/vfat
2008-02-21T18:48:00.000Z	macogw	Dr_willis	well you have to mkdir the mount point, right? so i mkdir the mount point and make it writable, then mount the flash drive to there.  i cant mount it to there if its not writable
2008-02-21T18:49:00.000Z	Dr_willis	macogw	 yes. the mountpoint dir MUST exist. but the permissions on that dir - have no affect on the permissions of the mountpoint/filesystem once you mount it.
2008-02-21T18:49:00.000Z	macogw	Dr_willis	but they do have an effect on your ability to mount to that point at all
2008-02-21T18:49:00.000Z	Dr_willis	macogw	 chmod +whatvber /media/mnt will NOT be in affect after you mount somthing to /media/mnt
2008-02-21T18:50:00.000Z	Dr_willis	macogw	 never noitced. :) thats what the 'user' option is for.
2008-02-21T18:50:00.000Z	macogw	Dr_willis	no if you do it as root you dont need to make it writable because well..root can do anything
2008-02-21T18:50:00.000Z	macogw	Dr_willis	its when you have the user option that the user has to be able to access the mount point to put the drive there
2008-02-21T18:50:00.000Z	Dr_willis	macogw	 ive never had to mess with the modes of any mountpoint that i can rember. :)  user lets users mount.. otherwise root needs it.. correct.
