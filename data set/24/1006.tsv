2010-09-15T17:18:00.000Z	DarkStar1	at05gt	KDE or gnome btw?
2010-09-15T17:20:00.000Z	at05gt	DarkStar1	so far from my foum research it appears the USB-ID is missing from the driver files and people are having to recompile to fix it, which is beyond my abilities at this time
2010-09-15T17:32:00.000Z	at05gt	DarkStar1	I think i foun a work around 10.04 contain the proper driver i just need to enable the usb id, ima go try it and see, ill let ya know how it goes
2010-09-15T17:32:00.000Z	DarkStar1	at05gt	Ok

2010-09-15T18:04:00.000Z	DarkStar1	at05gt	Still not showing any network connections eh?
2010-09-15T18:05:00.000Z	DarkStar1	at05gt	what happens when you try to connect?
2010-09-15T18:05:00.000Z	at05gt	DarkStar1	nothing, it just sits there trying to connect and never does
2010-09-15T18:10:00.000Z	at05gt	DarkStar1	its really frustrating me an making me not want to bother with Ubuntu and just deal with vista
2010-09-15T18:12:00.000Z	DarkStar1	at05gt	unfortunately my laptop is packed as I'm moving houses atm so I can;t help you today because I don't remember exactly how I solved the issue as it was a few months back
2010-09-15T18:12:00.000Z	at05gt	DarkStar1	its no big man, ill just go back to dealing with vista
