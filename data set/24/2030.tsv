2011-05-07T11:06:00.000Z	dirt	bluegoon	are you sharing from the linux to the windows, or the windows to the linux?
2011-05-07T11:06:00.000Z	bluegoon	dirt	I would actually like to share from Windows to linux
2011-05-07T11:06:00.000Z	bluegoon	dirt	is there some app I need from windows?
2011-05-07T11:07:00.000Z	bluegoon	dirt	or am I not setting something correctly on win 7?
2011-05-07T11:08:00.000Z	dirt	bluegoon	I'm kind of in the dark here, haven't shared a windows filesystem in ages, I know that Samba is needed to play nice with windows network shares
2011-05-07T11:08:00.000Z	dirt	bluegoon	trying to dig up more info now
2011-05-07T11:08:00.000Z	bluegoon	dirt	thanks dirt
2011-05-07T11:08:00.000Z	bluegoon	dirt	yea basically when I open Windows Network from Gnome, nothing is listed, though I can ping my Windows 7 machine
2011-05-07T11:12:00.000Z	dirt	bluegoon	and you've tried just running "Places > Connect to server..." and selecting "Windows Share" from the list??
2011-05-07T11:12:00.000Z	bluegoon	dirt	lemme check
