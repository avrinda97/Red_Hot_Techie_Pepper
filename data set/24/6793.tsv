2005-07-16T14:05:00.000Z	Computer__Guru		but for as long as ive been in linux, and as much as ive had to revert to windows here and there, ive always had a linux box
2005-07-16T14:05:00.000Z	Computer__Guru		ive also had a little experience with irix (6.14) and quite a bit of experience with FreeBSD 4 when I ran my DALnet servers
2005-07-16T14:06:00.000Z	Computer__Guru		but once i went debian, i never strayed from apt
2005-07-16T14:06:00.000Z	Computer__Guru		oh in high school i worked on a VAX/VMS system
2005-07-16T14:08:00.000Z	Computer__Guru		was there even bootable cd's in 92?
2005-07-16T14:08:00.000Z	Computer__Guru		my god the coffee's empty you muthafucka are crazy down here its empty like the head ont he shelf of a dead mans office
2005-07-16T14:09:00.000Z	Computer__Guru		actually
2005-07-16T14:09:00.000Z	Madpilot	Computer__Guru	wth?
2005-07-20T12:16:00.000Z	Computer__Guru	Madpilot	that was basically my idea for the nano-itx system
2005-07-20T13:29:00.000Z	Computer__Guru	Madpilot	that's the prettiest pussy ive seen in ages
2005-07-20T14:19:00.000Z	Madpilot	Computer__Guru	that's one of the things we're not supposed to do to ubotu, I think...
2005-07-22T14:09:00.000Z	Madpilot	Computer__Guru	you can msg ubotu to change entries, you know..
2005-07-22T14:10:00.000Z	Madpilot	Computer__Guru	just leave the ! out of the commands when you in msg w/ ubotu
2005-07-28T13:08:00.000Z	Madpilot	Computer__Guru	that's *exactly* what I mean. leave it alone, please
2005-07-28T13:10:00.000Z	Computer__Guru	Madpilot	that was actually a !! error, i didnt mean to paste anything
2005-07-28T13:10:00.000Z	Madpilot	Computer__Guru	paste to the wrong window? ;) been there, done that...
2005-07-28T13:11:00.000Z	Computer__Guru	Madpilot	no, i typed !java which tried to execute 'java', when i should have typed !!!java to say !java
2005-07-28T13:11:00.000Z	Madpilot	Computer__Guru	huh? !java works for me to get ubotu. why three !s?
2005-07-28T13:12:00.000Z	Computer__Guru	Madpilot	I use bangexec on gaim. if you !something it executes 'something' with stdout being the room/conversation that has focus
2005-07-28T13:12:00.000Z	Computer__Guru	Madpilot	!!something does the same, but only echoes the output to you
2005-07-28T13:13:00.000Z	Computer__Guru	Madpilot	and !!!something will say !something
2005-07-28T13:13:00.000Z	Madpilot	Computer__Guru	ouch. that sort of messes with using ubotu, doesn't it?
2005-07-28T13:13:00.000Z	Computer__Guru	Madpilot	that's why when i typed !java you all saw all that bs
2005-07-29T11:11:00.000Z	Madpilot	Computer__Guru	sorry, that's someone else's old model...
