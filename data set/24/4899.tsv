2009-08-11T23:51:00.000Z	Linux^Warrior		burn it to a cd as a live cd

2009-08-11T23:52:00.000Z	Linux^Warrior		well can you make a virtual cdrom stanley
2009-08-11T23:52:00.000Z	Linux^Warrior		should be in control panel
2009-08-11T23:53:00.000Z	Linux^Warrior		unetbootin is a linux thing not vista
2009-08-11T23:54:00.000Z	Halitech	Linux^Warrior	actually it runs on both and you don't need a cd, you can install it to a usb drive
2009-08-12T00:02:00.000Z	Halitech	Linux^Warrior	what do you mean, update ubuntu from 2.1 to 4?
2009-08-12T00:03:00.000Z	Halitech	Linux^Warrior	so you are years out of date?
2009-08-12T00:04:00.000Z	Halitech	Linux^Warrior	ok, you have the 9.04 install cd in your hand but what version is actually running on the laptop?
2009-08-12T00:05:00.000Z	Halitech	Linux^Warrior	maybe try Xubuntu 8.04 with the Alt install cd
2009-08-12T00:05:00.000Z	Halitech	Linux^Warrior	Ubuntu or Xubuntu?
2009-08-12T00:06:00.000Z	Halitech	Linux^Warrior	Xubuntu should run
2009-08-12T00:06:00.000Z	Halitech	Linux^Warrior	if the laptop is that useless to you, ship it to me c.o.d and I'll take it ;)
2009-08-12T00:07:00.000Z	Halitech	Linux^Warrior	I just finished installing Ubuntu on a Celly 638 with 384 meg of ram and it runs nicely
2009-08-12T00:08:00.000Z	Halitech	Linux^Warrior	but you have more power then I do
2009-08-12T00:09:00.000Z	Halitech	Linux^Warrior	only thing is I had a crappy video card so I had to disable the visual effects
2009-08-12T00:10:00.000Z	Halitech	Linux^Warrior	you could also try Debian with xfce http://forums.debian.net/viewtopic.php?t=26566
2009-08-12T00:11:00.000Z	Halitech	Linux^Warrior	the live cd won't, it needs 384 meg of ram but the alt install cd will work (just used it)
2009-08-12T00:11:00.000Z	Halitech	Linux^Warrior	get the debian net install cd, its only 150 med or so
