2006-08-30T11:50:00.000Z	sahara_arvind		hi there i have a serious query
2006-08-30T11:51:00.000Z	sahara_arvind		I wish to use ubuntu as an server with xampp running on it for hosting the intranet portal for my college.... is that justified?
2006-08-30T11:52:00.000Z	holycow	sahara_arvind	why not? linux makes a fantastic server.  its free and very powerfull
2006-08-30T11:52:00.000Z	holycow	sahara_arvind	 a bigger problem you might run into is licencing of the stuff your hosting :)
2006-08-30T11:52:00.000Z	sahara_arvind	holycow	ty for replying
2006-08-30T11:52:00.000Z	holycow	sahara_arvind	no probs, great nick btw
2006-08-30T11:53:00.000Z	sahara_arvind	holycow	i have tried ubuntu on desktop and i liked it .......
2006-08-30T11:53:00.000Z	holycow	sahara_arvind	it really depends on your skills but you can install ubuntu server edition, its the same just leaves out the desktop and other desktop related apps
2006-08-30T11:53:00.000Z	sahara_arvind	holycow	do u mind replying to few more queries
2006-08-30T11:54:00.000Z	holycow	sahara_arvind	just ask if i can't answer others might
2006-08-30T11:55:00.000Z	sahara_arvind	holycow	i was thinking of two options 1. to use ubuntu desktop version+xampp 2. ubuntu server edition+any control panel. I also have to assign a public IP (which i have spare) and a domain name to this proposed server ....... i wish to know more about its feasibility
2006-08-30T11:57:00.000Z	sahara_arvind	holycow	i would be needing apache+php+mysql (all latest versions) and my heart says that if i use any control panel onto ubuntu server then it may be easy to configure it for mails, domain name assigning etc......
2006-08-30T11:57:00.000Z	sahara_arvind	holycow	i found configuring apache and mysql separately a complex task
2006-08-30T11:58:00.000Z	holycow	sahara_arvind	on linux generally EVERYTHING seems complex until you learn it
2006-08-30T11:58:00.000Z	holycow	sahara_arvind	AFTER THAT its beyond stupid easy
2006-08-30T11:58:00.000Z	holycow	sahara_arvind	there is no real way to overcome the need to understand what you are using and what you are running and how to set it up ... we don't really have wizards per se
2006-08-30T11:59:00.000Z	holycow	sahara_arvind	perhaps you can google up and see if anyone has setup the same thing and if they offer how tos
2006-08-30T11:59:00.000Z	holycow	sahara_arvind	as an example, i needed to setup a spam blocking server and found instructions
2006-08-30T11:59:00.000Z	sahara_arvind	holycow	thanks.....
2006-08-30T12:00:00.000Z	sahara_arvind	holycow	can i ask about hardware (old spare server which i have) , whether the config is fine for ubuntu?
2006-08-30T12:00:00.000Z	holycow	sahara_arvind	most old  hardware will just work.  all you can do is really just try it.  if something doesn't work you will need to look it up.  no hard and fast rules really
2006-08-30T12:01:00.000Z	holycow	sahara_arvind	its very rare for old hardware not to work unles it has some weird chipset or config
2006-08-30T12:01:00.000Z	sahara_arvind	holycow	i have a P3 500, dual processor, 1 GB ram and 72 GB HDD, will it be able to server to atleast 20 pcs at any given time in the LAN?
2006-08-30T12:02:00.000Z	holycow	sahara_arvind	probably very easily
