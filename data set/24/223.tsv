2012-02-25T01:50:00.000Z	hydrox24		hi all!
2012-02-25T01:50:00.000Z	CFHowlett	hydrox24	  greetings
2012-03-04T11:17:00.000Z	CFHowlett	hydrox24	  broadcom wireless ...
2012-03-04T11:23:00.000Z	hydrox24	CFHowlett	can you bring me up to speed?
2012-03-04T11:24:00.000Z	CFHowlett	hydrox24	  on the wifi issue?
2012-03-04T11:28:00.000Z	hydrox24	CFHowlett	sorry, yes please
2012-03-04T11:29:00.000Z	CFHowlett	hydrox24	  per the ubuntu broadcom wiki, sylasl used the b43 no internet method to configure his wifi.  No joy.  He's got a broadcom 4318 and it should have worked.  I'd *almost* suggest compiling the broadcom sta linux driver as nothing else seems to work.
2012-03-04T11:36:00.000Z	hydrox24	CFHowlett	can I suggest the brcmsmac driver? it always works for me.
2012-03-04T11:39:00.000Z	CFHowlett	hydrox24	  well nothing else has worked ...
2012-03-06T03:29:00.000Z	hydrox24	CFHowlett	what are you helping santoshfamily to do? If it simply re-encoding mmp4 to avi then I would simply suggest using ffmpeg
2012-03-06T03:29:00.000Z	CFHowlett	hydrox24	  tried.ffmpeg choked on ac3
2012-03-06T03:29:00.000Z	hydrox24	CFHowlett	OK, so doing "ffmpeg -i input.mp4  output.avi" didn't work!
2012-03-06T03:34:00.000Z	CFHowlett	hydrox24	  that's not ffmpeg error / too  many spaces
2012-03-06T03:34:00.000Z	hydrox24	CFHowlett	oh, lol that makes more sense
2012-03-06T03:36:00.000Z	CFHowlett	hydrox24	  http://paste.ubuntu.com/870636/
2012-03-06T03:46:00.000Z	hydrox24	CFHowlett	that ffmpeg output looks strange to me. I compiled ffmpeg with all the codecs and my output is mroe verbose. I think we need to know how santoshfamily installed ffmpeg
2012-03-06T03:47:00.000Z	hydrox24	CFHowlett	agreed, seems like a good idea to me
2012-03-06T03:51:00.000Z	CFHowlett	hydrox24	  upgrades to new packages
2012-03-06T03:51:00.000Z	hydrox24	CFHowlett	yeh, that's what I thought.. thanks for confirming it
2012-03-06T04:19:00.000Z	hydrox24	CFHowlett	doesn't he need to look uner /etc/apt/sourc.list.d dir?
2012-03-06T04:20:00.000Z	CFHowlett	hydrox24	  just wanted to see if anything is there.  Like mine - it's empty.
2012-03-06T04:24:00.000Z	hydrox24	CFHowlett	I think that is the way to go.
2012-03-15T06:30:00.000Z	CFHowlett	hydrox24	  wubi install ...
2012-03-15T06:31:00.000Z	hydrox24	CFHowlett	OH.
