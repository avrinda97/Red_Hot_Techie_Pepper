2010-06-25T23:06:00.000Z	th1	ActionParsnip	ssh? ;)
2010-06-25T23:07:00.000Z	th1	ActionParsnip	exactly
2010-06-25T23:07:00.000Z	th1	ActionParsnip	or if you really gui hungry then vncserver will do nicely
2010-06-25T23:08:00.000Z	th1	ActionParsnip	mostly command line is better than web guis
2010-06-25T23:09:00.000Z	th1	ActionParsnip	all good torrent clients have cli interfaces and also nntp clients etc.
2010-06-25T23:10:00.000Z	th1	ActionParsnip	nice but could probably be done with a shell script that you associate with torrent mime type in the browser ;)
2010-06-25T23:11:00.000Z	th1	ActionParsnip	still I prefer not to have non-ssh holes in my firewall
2010-06-25T23:11:00.000Z	th1	ActionParsnip	so most I do from phone etc. would have to be ssh tunnelled anyway
2010-06-25T23:13:00.000Z	th1	ActionParsnip	I do that for MythWeb and some other stuff but I use https and authentication
2010-06-25T23:14:00.000Z	th1	ActionParsnip	mac filter won't work on the go
2010-06-25T23:14:00.000Z	th1	ActionParsnip	maybe OpenVPN for the phone if it's ported to G1
2010-06-25T23:15:00.000Z	th1	ActionParsnip	I tried it on my Symbian phone but the OpenVPN port was too flaky..
2010-07-23T22:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	th1	you can customise the install ISO and add the PPAs or even update the packages to be installed to be the latest ones
2010-07-23T22:35:00.000Z	th1	ActionParsnip	how is that going to help him when he wants to use sshfs??
2010-07-23T22:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	th1	copy the file over as user using sshfs then ssh over to use sudo to copy the data
2010-07-23T22:35:00.000Z	th1	ActionParsnip	not if he wants to access the file system as root
2010-07-23T22:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	th1	the user will be able to upload the files as user to the users home, then ssh in a console over then move the files
2010-07-23T22:40:00.000Z	th1	ActionParsnip	he obviously want to edit the files in place from the remote machine without logging in and copying them around afterwards
2010-07-23T22:40:00.000Z	th1	ActionParsnip	how doesn't that make sense
2010-07-23T22:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	th1	its more secure to disable root login with ssh, its the first account an attacker will use if s/he smells an SSH port open
2010-07-23T22:41:00.000Z	th1	ActionParsnip	of course it's more secure but if the password is good it doesn't really matter
2010-07-23T22:41:00.000Z	th1	ActionParsnip	main thing is that he wants to access files with root permissions from remote via sshfs and that does require an open root account
