2007-03-16T08:57:00.000Z	lilrayray		Hi all, I am having some bad crashes, and despite the help of a couple people here on IRC, I still have the problem.  Luckily, I have some more info that might help diagnose the problem.  Anyway, randomly, when using a web browser (firefox, opera, etc) ubuntu will freeze completely.  When I am not surfing the web, ubuntu has yet to crash.  recently, I installed samba, and I got identicle crashes except right at the login scree
2007-03-16T08:57:00.000Z	lilrayray		n.  Anyone have any idea what perhaps is causing this?
2007-03-16T08:59:00.000Z	ohir	lilrayray	seem like hardware problem
2007-03-16T08:59:00.000Z	ohir	lilrayray	or box with less than 128M RAM
2007-03-16T08:59:00.000Z	lilrayray	ohir	nah, I have 2 gb
2007-03-16T09:00:00.000Z	ohir	lilrayray	so its answer no 1
2007-03-16T09:00:00.000Z	lilrayray	ohir	but, I can browse the home network without freezes, I can come on here without freezes
2007-03-16T09:00:00.000Z	ohir	lilrayray	check your DNS settings then
2007-03-16T09:01:00.000Z	lilrayray	ohir	how might i do this?
2007-03-16T09:01:00.000Z	lilrayray	ohir	and also, is there anything in specific that I should be looking for?
2007-03-16T09:01:00.000Z	ohir	lilrayray	if "freeezes" are tied to using external networks
2007-03-16T09:03:00.000Z	ohir	lilrayray	fiest check if it relate to DNS. Give box enough time to sat "can't find someurl" or similar. If it does not say so for a couple of minutes, "freezes" likely are due to hardware.
2007-03-16T09:04:00.000Z	ohir	lilrayray	if it's DNS check your /etc/resolv.conf if there are valid dns server addresses (check with your isp)
2007-03-16T09:05:00.000Z	lilrayray	ohir	ok, but i do not understand how to check if it is related to DNS
2007-03-16T09:05:00.000Z	ohir	lilrayray	fiest check if it relate to DNS. Give box enough time to sat "can't find someurl" or similar. If it does not say so for a couple of minutes, "freezes" likely are due to hardware.
2007-03-16T09:05:00.000Z	ohir	lilrayray	some typos in that line
2007-03-16T09:07:00.000Z	lilrayray	ohir	so I do this in a browser?
2007-03-16T09:07:00.000Z	ohir	lilrayray	yes

2007-03-16T09:08:00.000Z	ohir	lilrayray	can be
2007-03-16T09:08:00.000Z	lilrayray	ohir	"server not found" come up instantly with the incorrect URL
2007-03-16T09:10:00.000Z	lilrayray	ohir	my resolve.conf has only two lines in it: "search home" "nameserver 192.168.1.1"
2007-03-16T09:11:00.000Z	ohir	lilrayray	so said I don't know how to help you more. Such freezes usual are sign of HW problems, but also can be related to network/dns misconfigurations.
