2006-03-09T13:22:00.000Z	globe		Has anybody ever used tpconfig?  how do I launch it?
2006-03-09T13:23:00.000Z	soundray	globe	I think you have to stop X and run it on the text console or something.
2006-03-09T13:23:00.000Z	globe	soundray	yep. I am running from console, but I dont remember the command
2006-03-09T13:23:00.000Z	soundray	globe	also, read man tpconfig
2006-03-09T13:23:00.000Z	globe	soundray	nice thought ;-)
2006-03-09T13:24:00.000Z	globe	soundray	but it says no entry
2006-03-09T13:24:00.000Z	soundray	globe	then it's not installed properly.
2006-03-09T13:24:00.000Z	soundray	globe	or you mistyped.
2006-03-09T13:24:00.000Z	globe	soundray	I can accept either of those.
2006-03-09T13:28:00.000Z	soundray	globe	you have to install tpconfig to use it, yes.
2006-03-09T13:29:00.000Z	globe	soundray	well...obviously ;-). I dl it as a tar.gz and then compiled it as a deb
2006-03-09T13:29:00.000Z	globe	soundray	doesnt that mean that its installed?
2006-03-09T13:29:00.000Z	soundray	globe	you shouldn't have done that. It's in the repositories.
2006-03-09T13:31:00.000Z	globe	soundray	but when I apt-get (after I updated) it cant find it
2006-03-09T13:31:00.000Z	soundray	globe	then you haven't set the universe repo properly, or you're not on breezy.
2006-03-09T13:32:00.000Z	globe	soundray	I wouldnt doubt that I didnt set up univers correctly.  I tried to follow the wiki on enabling them....
2006-03-09T13:35:00.000Z	soundray	globe	when you run 'sudo apt-get update' you should see a line similar to "Get:5 http://uk.archive.ubuntu.com breezy/universe Packages [2373kB] "
2006-03-09T13:35:00.000Z	soundray	globe	among the other lines
2006-03-10T15:35:00.000Z	soundray	globe	try 'sudo /etc/init.d/pcmcia restart'
2006-03-10T15:35:00.000Z	globe	soundray	does that rescan the pcmcia bus?
2006-03-10T15:36:00.000Z	soundray	globe	it used to, but it might have changed. The other thing you can try is '/etc/init.d/hotplug restart'
2006-03-10T15:36:00.000Z	globe	soundray	thanks
2007-03-02T12:46:00.000Z	soundray	globe	linux-source
2007-03-02T12:46:00.000Z	globe	soundray	hmmm....an obvious one!  thanks
