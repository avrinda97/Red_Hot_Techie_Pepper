2005-10-10T15:18:00.000Z	PassionLim		My laptop (samsung X05) contain 1 GB Memory. When the latop hibernated  and then waked up, it hang up, showing me the messange "resume= option should be used to set suspend device....swsusp: Need to copy 50894 pages". But I downgrade the memory to 512 MB, it works well. I wonder whether the hardware of my laptop have problem or I need to set something or satisfy some requirement to use hibernation?
