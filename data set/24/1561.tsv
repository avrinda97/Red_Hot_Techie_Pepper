2009-12-07T23:57:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	ubuntu	what! how do you boot?
2009-12-07T23:58:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	ubuntu	sounds like there is a config just the timer delay is set to 0
2010-04-08T00:55:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	ubuntu	what does it show instead of the SSID
2010-04-08T00:57:00.000Z	ubuntu	aeon-ltd	it shows 2 boxes with some 4 numeric characters inside.  something like a missing character to be displayed.
2010-04-08T00:58:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	ubuntu	so the SSID hasn't changed neither has any router settings since your network manager/wicd switchover?
2010-04-08T00:59:00.000Z	ubuntu	aeon-ltd	the dd-wrt SSID can read by iPod and Ubuntu 9.10 properly.  I think it is the problem of wicd.
2010-04-08T01:00:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	ubuntu	yeah if no changes have been made to the router or character sets your using then its most definitely a bug
2010-04-08T01:00:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	ubuntu	wait are you using the gtk interface or ncurses?
2010-04-08T01:01:00.000Z	ubuntu	aeon-ltd	I am using backtrack's KDE.
2010-07-04T19:00:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	ubuntu	by having a /boot partition
2010-07-04T19:01:00.000Z	ubuntu	aeon-ltd	you mean I must create a partition which its mount point is /boot yeah?
2010-07-04T19:02:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	ubuntu	yeah a separate partition that basically contains all of grub
2010-07-04T19:03:00.000Z	ubuntu	aeon-ltd	then can I have other OS s with it for example after installiing ubuntu and ofcourse grub seperated from the /
2010-07-04T19:04:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	ubuntu	what you want is a / /home /boot setup and then obviously another / or ntfs for your other os
2010-07-04T19:05:00.000Z	ubuntu	aeon-ltd	I am worry about when I install Windows SEVEN all the grub settings disappears and just seven load itself
2010-07-04T19:06:00.000Z	ubuntu	aeon-ltd	I want something that is independant from OS
2010-07-04T19:06:00.000Z	ubuntu	aeon-ltd	can I have this by installing grub in another partition as u said?
2010-07-04T19:07:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	ubuntu	from experience its easier to have 7 first then ubuntu on top, however you can use something like supergribdisk to restore grub after windows is in
2010-09-22T01:37:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	ubuntu	its part of your theme
2010-09-22T01:37:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	ubuntu	on whatever client your using
2011-08-17T03:23:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	ubuntu	you mean persistent?
2011-11-16T02:09:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	ubuntu	/j ubuntu-ir
