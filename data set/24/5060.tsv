2006-11-05T10:14:00.000Z	wastrel	PinkFloyd	 do you have a DHCP server on your network?
2006-11-05T10:14:00.000Z	PinkFloyd	wastrel	may I query?
2006-11-05T10:14:00.000Z	wastrel	PinkFloyd	 no, keep it in chan i am not actually that smart, other ppl will help
2006-11-05T10:16:00.000Z	wastrel	PinkFloyd	 so the card is seen by the kernel and it's "up" ?
2006-11-05T10:17:00.000Z	wastrel	PinkFloyd	 do you have a router or firewall between you and the internet?
2006-11-05T10:19:00.000Z	wastrel	PinkFloyd	 can you ping 64.233.161.99
2006-11-05T10:19:00.000Z	PinkFloyd	wastrel	it's not connected right now
2006-11-05T10:20:00.000Z	wastrel	PinkFloyd	 trying to figure out if it's a DNS or a connection prob
2006-11-05T10:20:00.000Z	wastrel	PinkFloyd	 you can connect to repos?
2006-11-05T10:22:00.000Z	wastrel	PinkFloyd	 so next time you are on linux, try to ping 64.233.161.99
2006-11-05T10:22:00.000Z	PinkFloyd	wastrel	my IP changes everytime it connect
2006-11-05T10:22:00.000Z	wastrel	PinkFloyd	 that will determine if it's DNS or IP
2006-11-05T10:22:00.000Z	wastrel	PinkFloyd	 your DNS addresses are always the same, they're your ISP's  yes dns server are necessary
2006-11-05T10:24:00.000Z	wastrel	PinkFloyd	 yes, you will needat least 1 dns server address in your network config
2006-11-05T10:25:00.000Z	wastrel	PinkFloyd	 write down the ones you're using in windows and use those on linux also
2006-11-05T10:25:00.000Z	wastrel	PinkFloyd	 i don't use windows ;]   i think in the control panel, network, ethernet properties or something.
2006-11-05T10:30:00.000Z	wastrel	PinkFloyd	 it's  sudo oem-config-prepare   (no - after sudo)
