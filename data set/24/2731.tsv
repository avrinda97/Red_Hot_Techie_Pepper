2009-03-02T01:34:00.000Z	s_spiff		guys..i'm on hardy heron ..would like to know what to install when it comes to nvidia drivers? i see two in synaptic... nvidia - glx and nvidia-glx-new
2009-03-02T01:35:00.000Z	redvamp128	s_spiff	 it all comes down to what version number is recommended by nvidia for your card (I can if you give me the model look up the correct number)
2009-03-02T01:35:00.000Z	s_spiff	redvamp128	: 9500 GT
2009-03-02T01:37:00.000Z	redvamp128	s_spiff	 Nvidia says 180 is the drivers so it would be once you enable the restricted and the multiverse for software sources -- sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx-180
2009-03-02T01:37:00.000Z	s_spiff	redvamp128	thanks a ton. will do :)
2009-03-02T01:38:00.000Z	redvamp128	s_spiff	 just remember to when you want to change the setings use sudo nvidia-settings
2009-03-02T01:38:00.000Z	redvamp128	s_spiff	 that is after you install the nvidia drivers
2009-03-02T01:38:00.000Z	s_spiff	redvamp128	yes, i'll remember that :)
2009-03-02T01:38:00.000Z	redvamp128	s_spiff	 if you don't it will just change it for that user and go back to default upon reboot
2009-03-02T01:39:00.000Z	s_spiff	redvamp128	ok
2009-03-02T01:48:00.000Z	s_spiff	redvamp128	no sign of version 180 in the repos
2009-03-02T01:48:00.000Z	redvamp128	s_spiff	 you have to enable multiverse and restricted in your software sources
2009-03-02T01:49:00.000Z	s_spiff	redvamp128	i have.. which is why i'm getting version 1.96 smething and 1.69 something..
2009-03-02T01:51:00.000Z	redvamp128	s_spiff	 then I would go with the -new
2009-03-02T01:51:00.000Z	s_spiff	redvamp128	ok
2009-03-02T01:53:00.000Z	redvamp128	s_spiff	 for the nvidia you can just type sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx-new
2009-03-02T01:54:00.000Z	s_spiff	redvamp128	almost installed.. waiting for it to ocmplete
2009-03-02T02:01:00.000Z	s_spiff	redvamp128	install nvidia glx new didn't work.. no differnce :(

2009-03-02T02:03:00.000Z	s_spiff	redvamp128	yes
