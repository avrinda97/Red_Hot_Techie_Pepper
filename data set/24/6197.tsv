2005-12-22T07:32:00.000Z	ElitePete		anyone know where i can get some more screensavers for ubuntu?
2005-12-22T07:32:00.000Z	dooglus	ElitePete	xscreensaver and xlockmore have a lot of screensavers
2005-12-22T07:33:00.000Z	ElitePete	dooglus	i know but i want more :-P
2005-12-22T07:33:00.000Z	dooglus	ElitePete	electricsheep ?
2005-12-22T07:33:00.000Z	ElitePete	dooglus	?
2005-12-22T07:34:00.000Z	dooglus	ElitePete	have you seen it?  it's another screen saver.  see also kscreensaver
2005-12-22T16:46:00.000Z	dooglus	ElitePete	you probably need to ask the question
2005-12-23T07:19:00.000Z	dooglus	ElitePete	firestarter isn't really a firewall - it's just a front-end that configures the built-in iptables firewall.
2005-12-23T07:19:00.000Z	dooglus	ElitePete	you can uninstall firestarter, but iptables will still be built in
2005-12-23T07:19:00.000Z	dooglus	ElitePete	maybe your router is blocking it?
2005-12-23T07:20:00.000Z	dooglus	ElitePete	what do you see if you "sudo iptables -L | grep 6112" ?
2005-12-23T07:20:00.000Z	ElitePete	dooglus	i see nothing
2005-12-23T07:21:00.000Z	dooglus	ElitePete	if you "sudo iptables -L" then?
2005-12-23T07:21:00.000Z	dooglus	ElitePete	that means all ports are open
2005-12-23T07:21:00.000Z	dooglus	ElitePete	that's the default setup in ubuntu
2005-12-23T07:21:00.000Z	ElitePete	dooglus	but i have proven that when i have firestarter firewall enabled it blocks my port for the program
2005-12-23T07:23:00.000Z	dooglus	ElitePete	you see how firestarter is just configuring the iptables rules though?
2005-12-23T07:24:00.000Z	ElitePete	dooglus	i think so.
2005-12-23T08:28:00.000Z	dooglus	ElitePete	no, it's different.  solaris, hp-ux, linux - they're all kinds of UNIX
2005-12-23T08:53:00.000Z	ElitePete	dooglus	probably not different actually..? do you mean external or internal
2005-12-23T08:53:00.000Z	dooglus	ElitePete	I mean intermal
2005-12-23T08:53:00.000Z	ElitePete	dooglus	oh yes then certanly.
2005-12-23T08:53:00.000Z	dooglus	ElitePete	I'm guessing he set up a static IP in Windows, but ubuntu is using dhcp
2005-12-23T08:53:00.000Z	ElitePete	dooglus	yep
