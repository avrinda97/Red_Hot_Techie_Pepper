2006-10-05T13:25:00.000Z	holycow		this isn't a charity, at least thats how i look at it
2006-10-05T13:26:00.000Z	holycow		when was the last time youve seen any open source project get money, let alone scads for years?
2006-10-05T13:27:00.000Z	holycow		also NOT  great example, considering they went broke and barely managed to buy out code on a one time basis
2006-10-05T13:27:00.000Z	holycow		mozilla managed to wrangle up that google deal but thats the exception not the rule
2006-10-05T13:28:00.000Z	holycow		i pay regularly for development on various open source application servers
2006-10-05T13:28:00.000Z	holycow		not us thats for sure :)
2006-10-05T13:29:00.000Z	holycow		hans seems to think he is always in debt
2006-10-05T13:29:00.000Z	holycow		although he has bigger problems these days, being his wife is missing under dubious circumstances :/
2006-10-05T13:30:00.000Z	holycow		they just implemented it, thus you can talk to netmeeting people
2006-10-05T13:31:00.000Z	holycow		th4ere is no 64 bit for windows either btw
2006-10-05T13:31:00.000Z	swashbucklinstev	holycow	when did that happen?
2006-10-05T13:52:00.000Z	holycow	swashbucklinstev	oh
2006-10-05T13:52:00.000Z	swashbucklinstev	holycow	is that more overhead than hardware raid?
2006-10-05T13:53:00.000Z	holycow	swashbucklinstev	not really, cpu does the work but its not a huge issue for the average cpu these days.  it hasn't been for a long time, unless you are doing something like setting up a productio nserver
2006-10-05T13:54:00.000Z	swashbucklinstev	holycow	makes sense then, especially since I'm a person who believes in garbage collected languages, i can definitely sympathize with the notion of sw raid
2006-10-05T13:55:00.000Z	holycow	swashbucklinstev	*nod*
2006-10-05T14:01:00.000Z	holycow	swashbucklinstev	cool :)
2006-10-05T14:02:00.000Z	swashbucklinstev	holycow	pretty impressive, atleast I think I'm running all 64bit apps. I definitely feel a marked improvement over the Windows install (non 64) that was on it originally. HP doesn't sell their computers with 64bit OSs despite having processors for it. Ugh.
2006-10-05T14:03:00.000Z	holycow	swashbucklinstev	i've given up on manufacturers *nod* i understand why they do what they do, but i'm gratefull to have the skill and knkowledge to have an option
2006-10-05T14:03:00.000Z	swashbucklinstev	holycow	the only thing that has me bent is the Flash player and I'm about to take that on, I found a guide from breezy days that should have it running in 32bit atleast
2006-10-05T14:05:00.000Z	swashbucklinstev	holycow	this is non-chroot, would you like the URL?
2006-10-05T14:05:00.000Z	holycow	swashbucklinstev	not really, i'll dig it up when i get to it :)
2006-10-05T14:11:00.000Z	swashbucklinstev	holycow	hah! what are the chances
2006-10-05T14:11:00.000Z	holycow	swashbucklinstev	with debian, pertty damned good actually
