2006-12-26T09:00:00.000Z	mirshafie		Hello. I have a huge problem with my file systems. After using the computer for a while, I'm suddenly unable to write to them, and I get a message which say the disk is full. But df or any other tool will claim that they still have plenty of space available. This happens on both my hard drives - I have two large  ext3 partitions. What's wrong?
2006-12-26T09:00:00.000Z	LameBMX	mirshafie	did you do it under root
2006-12-26T09:02:00.000Z	mirshafie	LameBMX	well, it seems that if i'm root i can in fact write to my disks. cool. but still, do you know a way to fix it?
2006-12-26T09:04:00.000Z	LameBMX	mirshafie	you are writing to the ntfs .. did you set option umask=0222 in fstab?
2006-12-26T09:05:00.000Z	LameBMX		cuz nix cant chown -R a ntfs drive properly
2006-12-26T09:05:00.000Z	LameBMX		or did you do -o umask=0222 when you mounted it if you did it that way mirshafie
2006-12-26T09:06:00.000Z	mirshafie	LameBMX	I'm not a Windows user, I don't use NTFS. Only Ext3 for me a the time.
2006-12-26T09:06:00.000Z	LameBMX		oh ... well im a nix n00b
2006-12-26T09:06:00.000Z	LameBMX		and only have very limited knowledge
2006-12-26T09:06:00.000Z	LameBMX	mirshafie	is this your computer .. ie could someone have set disk usage for ur account
2006-12-26T09:07:00.000Z	mirshafie	LameBMX	yea, it's mine, only i have access. the strange thing is that it works fine for a few hours, then it just gets stupid and says the disks are full
2006-12-26T09:08:00.000Z	LameBMX	mirshafie	but root can write fine correct?
2006-12-26T09:09:00.000Z	mirshafie	LameBMX	yes, it seems so :)
2006-12-26T09:10:00.000Z	LameBMX		and you have write rights to the places your are trying to write too correct?
2006-12-26T09:10:00.000Z	LameBMX		chmod -R 777 /
2006-12-26T09:10:00.000Z	LameBMX		lol
