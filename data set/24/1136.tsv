2010-06-24T15:20:00.000Z	LjL	ubun7u	can you summarize what happened for me?
2010-06-24T15:21:00.000Z	LjL	ubun7u	were you doing anything special when you rebooted? installing upgrades, something?
2010-06-24T15:22:00.000Z	LjL	ubun7u	have you tried booting into recovery mode?
2010-06-24T15:22:00.000Z	LjL	ubun7u	have you tried booting with the init=/bin/bash kernel option?
2010-06-24T15:23:00.000Z	ubun7u	LjL	how would i do that
2010-06-24T15:24:00.000Z	LjL	ubun7u	well, in your GRUB menu, you need to edit your kernel command line and add init=/bin/bash on the line where it also says "quiet" among other things. i cannot be much more specific because i've only used GRUB 1, not GRUB 2
2010-06-24T15:24:00.000Z	LjL	ubun7u	are you on the same computer you have ubuntu on now? (i ask to know whether you can stay on irc while rebooting and trying stuff)
2010-06-24T15:25:00.000Z	LjL	ubun7u	please ignore these two
2010-06-24T15:26:00.000Z	LjL	ubun7u	well, i'm not laughing. the last part is actually good advice anyway, you can try a manual fsck to see if the filesystem got corrupted
2010-06-24T15:28:00.000Z	LjL	ubun7u	i've found the instruction to edit the command line in GRUB2. see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2#Editing Menus During Boot   -   you will need to add "init=/bin/bash" on the line where it says "quiet splash"
2010-06-24T15:28:00.000Z	LjL	ubun7u	but, try fsck first
2010-06-24T15:38:00.000Z	LjL	ubun7u	ok then what i can suggest is 1) run "apt-get -f install" to ensure APT is in a stable state 2) install 'debsums' and run "debsums -s -g" to see what files may ended up corrupted, and then reinstall the relevant packages.  to do this, you need to either manage to boot up (with init=/bin/bash possibly), or to use a chroot from the live CD, which is a bit complicated.
2010-06-24T15:39:00.000Z	ubun7u	LjL	with chroot?
2010-06-24T15:40:00.000Z	LjL	ubun7u	well, chroot is a program that makes the system think the root directory is something different than what it actually is. namely, you'd use it on the live cd to make it think it's actually running from your HDD, so that you can try fixing it. however, i'm not sure just doing "chroot /media/sda1" will be enough, i must admit i've very rarely used this.
