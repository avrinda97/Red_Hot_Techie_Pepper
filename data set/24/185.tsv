2012-10-02T23:26:00.000Z	L3mce	Siegel-	he means raw data format rather than, say, a .jpg... what are you trying to open them with?
2012-10-02T23:26:00.000Z	Siegel-	L3mce	BinaryMaster when they show up on my computer the ending is .jpg
2012-10-02T23:27:00.000Z	L3mce	Siegel-	then I will need the actual error with a specific program.
2012-10-02T23:27:00.000Z	Siegel-	L3mce	okay there is an error with image viewer. ill tell you in a minute
2012-10-02T23:28:00.000Z	L3mce	Siegel-	see if you can open them with GIMP.
2012-10-02T23:29:00.000Z	Siegel-	L3mce	i have gimp, ill try that next time if it doesnt work
2012-10-02T23:41:00.000Z	L3mce	Siegel-	displayed as a thumbnail in Nautilus?
2012-10-02T23:41:00.000Z	Siegel-	L3mce	12.4
2012-10-02T23:41:00.000Z	Siegel-	L3mce	latest version, if thats the name then yes
2012-10-02T23:41:00.000Z	L3mce	Siegel-	Nautilus is the file manager for Ubuntu...
2012-10-02T23:42:00.000Z	Siegel-	L3mce	oh yes its in the cameras folder, adn then dcim....
2012-10-02T23:42:00.000Z	L3mce	Siegel-	while in the directory where you see the thumbnail, press ctrl + L  and paste the path at the top which appears
2012-10-02T23:42:00.000Z	Siegel-	L3mce	ok
2012-10-02T23:42:00.000Z	Siegel-	L3mce	gphoto2://[usb:001,025]/DCIM/100CANON
2012-10-02T23:43:00.000Z	Siegel-	L3mce	i see. what do i do about that
2012-10-02T23:43:00.000Z	L3mce	Siegel-	^
2012-10-02T23:44:00.000Z	Siegel-	L3mce	dunno how to do that
2012-10-02T23:45:00.000Z	L3mce	Siegel-	I use KDE... but at the top of Dolphin, we have a "split" button which will allow us to drag and drop from one dir to another in the same window... just open another file manager if you dont, and drag and drop one and see if you can open it locallyw ithout a problem.
2012-10-02T23:46:00.000Z	Siegel-	L3mce	do i have another file manager?
2012-10-02T23:46:00.000Z	L3mce	Siegel-	you can open multiple instances I mean
2012-10-02T23:46:00.000Z	Siegel-	L3mce	it would be the same manager. or do you mean a separate window ? like go into a different folder in a separate window? and then what? drag and drop a file into there?
2012-10-02T23:47:00.000Z	Siegel-	L3mce	ok let me try
2012-10-02T23:50:00.000Z	L3mce	Siegel-	because you are viewing it in thumbnail mode... It has to read all of your very large picture files and then convert then to thumbs, nd then display them
