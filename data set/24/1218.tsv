2010-06-04T05:24:00.000Z	blue_anna	jasper_	when you ls /media/cdrom0 -- it exists?
2010-06-04T05:24:00.000Z	blue_anna	jasper_	what cd are you mounting?
2010-06-04T05:26:00.000Z	blue_anna	jasper_	that would do it :) sudo mkdir /media/cdrom0 and then try again
2010-06-04T05:27:00.000Z	blue_anna	jasper_	ls again and see if your stuff is there?
2010-06-04T05:29:00.000Z	blue_anna	jasper_	hmm .. please check in /etc/mtab to see if you find a line for /media/cdrom0
2010-06-04T05:30:00.000Z	blue_anna	jasper_	if not, I'm not really sur what happened .. do you have a cd we know what format it is in? like an old music cd or an ubuntu live cd ?
2010-06-04T05:32:00.000Z	blue_anna	jasper_	what is in the drive now?
2010-06-04T05:33:00.000Z	blue_anna	jasper_	that runs on linux?
2010-06-04T05:34:00.000Z	blue_anna	jasper_	well, the dev is wrong .. udf is for dvds -- I don't know if it matters
2010-06-04T05:34:00.000Z	blue_anna	jasper_	try this: sudo mount /dev/dvd /media/cdrom0
2010-06-04T05:35:00.000Z	blue_anna	jasper_	or if that fails add the -t udf in there
2010-06-04T05:36:00.000Z	blue_anna	jasper_	cd you ls it and see your stuff?
2010-06-04T05:38:00.000Z	blue_anna	jasper_	congradulations :) you've suceeded
