2009-03-04T04:04:00.000Z	Jufis		Could somebody here help me with my sound issues?
2009-03-04T04:04:00.000Z	mbreum	Jufis	Probably not, but what are you after?
2009-03-04T04:05:00.000Z	Jufis	mbreum	I don't know what settings I should set in System-Preferences-Sound. I get my sounds to work in one application but then they do not work in another. And now I can't get them to work in firefox at all.
2009-03-04T04:07:00.000Z	mbreum	Jufis	What apps does it work in? Where do you output sound?
2009-03-04T04:08:00.000Z	Jufis	mbreum	I can get rhythmbox to work. But that's it. I got it to work in skype too but then rhythmbox didn't work.
2009-03-04T04:10:00.000Z	mbreum	Jufis	I'm really not an expert at all, but you should set your default sound card with asoundconf
2009-03-04T04:11:00.000Z	Jufis	mbreum	I'll try that.
2009-03-04T04:16:00.000Z	Jufis	mbreum	I just use "asoundconf list" to find out my soundcard's name and then "asoundconf set-default-card" to set it as default?
2009-03-04T04:17:00.000Z	mbreum	Jufis	yes, I would assume so
2009-03-04T04:18:00.000Z	Jufis	mbreum	do I need to unset pulseaudio or oss? or do anything else?
2009-03-04T04:20:00.000Z	mbreum	Jufis	Heard someone say that you shouldn't use pulse and recommended uninstalling it. Why do you have oss - did you install that explicitly?
2009-03-04T04:22:00.000Z	Jufis	mbreum	I don't know how did I got oss. Can I uninstall it?
2009-03-04T04:24:00.000Z	mbreum	Jufis	I guess you can... sudo apt-get remove [packagename] - packagenames can be found with sudo apt-cache search oss
2009-03-04T04:24:00.000Z	Jufis	mbreum	okay. I'll uninstall oss. Should I uninstall pulse too?
2009-03-04T04:28:00.000Z	Jufis	mbreum	I also got ALSA. Should I leave it or uninstall it?
2009-03-04T04:29:00.000Z	mbreum	Jufis	ALSA is the default
2009-03-04T04:29:00.000Z	Jufis	mbreum	oh okay
2009-03-04T04:31:00.000Z	Jufis	mbreum	sorry to bother you so much, but seems like I have this linux-sound-base package installed. "base package for ALSA and OSS sound systems. This package allows the administrator to choose between the OSS and ALSA sound systems."
2009-03-04T04:31:00.000Z	Jufis	mbreum	I think I got oss with that package
2009-03-04T04:33:00.000Z	mbreum	Jufis	Hm.. I would think you could uninstall oss and leave the sound-base package in place
2009-03-04T04:37:00.000Z	Jufis	mbreum	lol. When I select pulseaudio to be uninstalled from synaptic package manager, it says that I need to uninstall ubuntu-desktop too.
2009-03-04T04:38:00.000Z	mbreum	Jufis	Is alsa installed? If not, you may install that and see if you can remove pulse then...
2009-03-04T04:42:00.000Z	Jufis	mbreum	yes, I have alsa installed
2009-03-04T04:49:00.000Z	mbreum	Jufis	Signing off - hope you get it working. May the force be with you!
