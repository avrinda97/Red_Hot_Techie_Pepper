2009-09-22T22:55:00.000Z	eurythmia_	exodus_ms	thanks, I'll take a look and let you know.
2009-09-22T22:56:00.000Z	exodus_ms	eurythmia_	by the way, witch version of ubuntu are you using
2009-09-22T22:58:00.000Z	eurythmia_	exodus_ms	I don't think it'll help, because I've specified "root (hd0,4)" which is the result of "find /boot/grub/stage1" ... also, I'm using jaunty on the affected machine.
2009-09-22T23:00:00.000Z	exodus_ms	eurythmia_	Ya, you just need to make changes to the  /boot/grub/menu.lst file so that grub is looking in the right place, Look at  sudo fdisk -l | grep -i linux  and make sure you have the correct "root" partition
2009-09-22T23:00:00.000Z	eurythmia_	exodus_ms	have you looked at the paste that was included in my problem description?
2009-09-22T23:01:00.000Z	exodus_ms	eurythmia_	shamelessly I have not, it was rather long :P I can take a look though
2009-09-22T23:02:00.000Z	eurythmia_	exodus_ms	it's only 44 lines, only 23 of which are actual grub.conf ... the rest are the details of the partitions on my disk.
2009-09-22T23:06:00.000Z	exodus_ms	eurythmia_	I understand that, but have tried to understand why grub would fail in the first place? It's looking for a file to load that is obviously not located where it is looking, double check  your /boot/grub/menu.lst file  and  sudo fdisk -l | grep -i linux  your / is sda5 no? but it's labled 4 in your boot list?
2009-09-22T23:07:00.000Z	eurythmia_	exodus_ms	that's because of the way grub labels drives ... hda1 = (hd0,0), hda2 = (hd0,1), etc.
2009-09-22T23:08:00.000Z	exodus_ms	eurythmia_	wait, you installed Ubuntu after xp correct?
2009-09-22T23:08:00.000Z	eurythmia_	exodus_ms	yes.
2009-09-22T23:08:00.000Z	eurythmia_	exodus_ms	what is the suspicion?
2009-09-22T23:10:00.000Z	exodus_ms	eurythmia_	is your box loading xp after you boot, or is it just hanging on the grub error?
2009-09-22T23:10:00.000Z	eurythmia_	exodus_ms	it's just hanging on the grub error
2009-09-22T23:11:00.000Z	exodus_ms	eurythmia_	the only thing I can think of is repair grub on the xp partition, if thats what you installed first and if that what you want your "1" choice to be
2009-09-22T23:13:00.000Z	eurythmia_	exodus_ms	I'm confused. I installed grub on the MBR ... ntldr is the only bootloader installed on the XP partition.
2009-09-22T23:16:00.000Z	exodus_ms	eurythmia_	what about this   #/dev/sda1  1   11   88326  de   Dell Utility I know you have your boot list to start at (hd0,4)
2009-09-22T23:17:00.000Z	eurythmia_	exodus_ms	you want me to try making that the first entry in the grub list?
2009-09-22T23:17:00.000Z	exodus_ms	eurythmia_	I'm sorry boot is selected at #/dev/sda2 according to your fstab
2009-09-22T23:18:00.000Z	eurythmia_	exodus_ms	yeah, sda2 is selected as a bootable partition ... but the bootloader installed on the MBR can *override* that. I suppose I could try disabling the boot flag on /dev/sda2 to see what happens.
2009-09-22T23:19:00.000Z	exodus_ms	eurythmia_	or change the *override* and set your boot list to start with that one
2009-09-22T23:20:00.000Z	eurythmia_	exodus_ms	I just removed the boot flag, now I'm rebooting (into knoppix again).
2009-09-22T23:20:00.000Z	exodus_ms	eurythmia_	then after that you can configure grub however you want, or just reinstall grub and let it find everything all over agian
