2008-03-30T12:45:00.000Z	DistroJockey	lux	try going to System - Preferences - Appearance  then drag and drop your theme file in that window
2008-03-30T13:16:00.000Z	DistroJockey	lux	drag the whole file (not extracted)
2008-03-30T13:17:00.000Z	DistroJockey	lux	the file you downloaded? dragged that?
2008-03-30T13:19:00.000Z	DistroJockey	lux	It's not really a folder, drag the file you downloaded
2008-03-30T13:20:00.000Z	lux	DistroJockey	i drag√®d but it still dont take that file
2008-03-30T13:21:00.000Z	lux	DistroJockey	thats zip file that i downloaded
2008-03-30T13:21:00.000Z	DistroJockey	lux	I believe you can even drag and drop the download link on the web page straight into Appearance
2008-03-30T13:21:00.000Z	DistroJockey	lux	ohh
2008-03-30T13:21:00.000Z	lux	DistroJockey	ohh?
2008-03-30T13:22:00.000Z	DistroJockey	lux	can you give me a link to where you got it?
2008-03-30T13:25:00.000Z	DistroJockey	lux	ok, right click on the zip file and choose extract here, then drag and drop the .gz file in Appearance
2008-03-30T13:26:00.000Z	DistroJockey	lux	when you drag, hover over the Appearance window in the task bar till it pops up
