2010-09-30T03:30:00.000Z	acicula	pipopooo	do none of the kernels work or does it just not work with the latest kernel?
2010-09-30T03:30:00.000Z	pipopooo	acicula	it does not work with the latest kernel
2010-09-30T03:31:00.000Z	acicula	pipopooo	any relevant errors?
2010-09-30T03:31:00.000Z	pipopooo	acicula	kernel 2.6.32-25
2010-09-30T03:31:00.000Z	pipopooo	acicula	iwconfig shows wlan0, but cannot bring it up
2010-09-30T03:32:00.000Z	pipopooo	acicula	if i do ifconfig wlan0 up it fails
2010-09-30T03:32:00.000Z	acicula	pipopooo	aah
2010-09-30T03:32:00.000Z	pipopooo	acicula	yes
2010-09-30T03:32:00.000Z	pipopooo	acicula	anyway to get the drivers off of live cd to get it working?
2010-09-30T03:34:00.000Z	pipopooo	acicula	is it possible to grab the drivers from /lib/firmware ?
2010-09-30T03:34:00.000Z	acicula	pipopooo	well you could try loading a driver from a similar major kernel version, ie the previous version, but its not a given its the iw driver itself
2010-09-30T03:34:00.000Z	pipopooo	acicula	not understanding
2010-09-30T03:35:00.000Z	acicula	pipopooo	does ifconfig give an error?
2010-09-30T03:36:00.000Z	pipopooo	acicula	yes
2010-09-30T03:36:00.000Z	pipopooo	acicula	ifconfig wlan0 up -> SIOCSIFFLAGS: No such device
2010-09-30T03:37:00.000Z	acicula	pipopooo	whats the output from modprobe iwl3945 ?
2010-09-30T03:39:00.000Z	acicula	pipopooo	what are the last few lines from dmesg?
2010-09-30T03:39:00.000Z	pipopooo	acicula	not sure on live usb at the moment
2010-09-30T03:40:00.000Z	acicula	pipopooo	the driver is stored under /lib/modules/<somekernel>/net?
2010-09-30T03:41:00.000Z	pipopooo	acicula	not sure where it should go
2010-09-30T03:42:00.000Z	acicula	pipopooo	im a bit rusty on forcing drivers to load, er insmod ./driver.ko may work? not sure if you can get away without dropping the driver in the current kernels /lib/modules/kernel tree
