2005-04-18T08:57:00.000Z	Florsch		no i meant, can i start update it by using apt-get upgrade
2005-04-18T08:57:00.000Z	Florsch		- start
2005-04-18T08:58:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Florsch	change all warty to hoary in /etc/apt/sources.list. then sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
2005-04-18T09:04:00.000Z	Florsch	thoreauputic	i now have a error while using apt-get update
2005-04-18T09:05:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Florsch	check your sources.list
2005-04-18T09:05:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Florsch	unless it's an auth warning - you can ignore those
2005-04-18T09:06:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Florsch	sudo apt-get update
2005-04-18T09:12:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Florsch	actually for a dist upgrade from warty that's quite low...
2005-04-18T09:12:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Florsch	make sure you are running ` sudo apt-get dist-upgrade `
2005-04-18T09:13:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Florsch	no, if you've done update just run the dist-upgrade
2005-04-18T09:15:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Florsch	that's more like it
2005-04-18T09:15:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Florsch	I think that will be right
2005-05-10T06:38:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Florsch	you need to find the url for it
2005-05-10T06:40:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Florsch	you just use copy paste
2005-05-10T06:41:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Florsch	make a new preselection, put the url in,  then bookmark it
2005-05-10T06:42:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Florsch	under stream, select new preselection: there's a space for the url in the dialog that pops up
2005-05-10T06:43:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Florsch	then click OK - that's all thereis to it
2005-05-10T06:44:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Florsch	it should show in preselections, then you bookmark it
2005-05-10T06:45:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Florsch	then you made a mistake
2005-05-10T06:45:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Florsch	it does that if it can't find it
2005-05-10T06:45:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Florsch	make sure the url is correct
2005-05-10T06:47:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Florsch	heh - that's a plylist, not an URL
2005-05-10T06:49:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Florsch	you might need to download the playlist and look at it in a text editor to find the url
2005-05-10T06:50:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Florsch	typically there are several url in th efile
