2011-05-30T03:09:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	tanath	FYI even "purge" won't touch config files in a home directory
2011-05-30T03:09:00.000Z	tanath	ZykoticK9	that's why i mentioned there too
2011-05-30T03:12:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	tanath	+1 cwd "should not be" in $PATH ;)
2011-06-02T01:45:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	tanath	do you have anything installed in wine that you care about?  if you don't, just delete your ~/.wine folder - problem solved ;)
2011-06-02T02:08:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	tanath	not on gnu/linux systems ;)
2011-06-02T03:32:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	tanath	remove evolution will remove the ubuntu-desktop metapackage... can cause issues, especially if trying to update.
2011-06-02T03:32:00.000Z	tanath	ZykoticK9	taht's what ubuntu-minimal is for
2011-06-02T03:32:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	tanath	well not really - but i see your point
2011-06-02T03:33:00.000Z	tanath	ZykoticK9	oh?
2011-06-02T03:33:00.000Z	tanath	ZykoticK9	if it's buggy without ubuntu-desktop, that'd be bugs, yes?
2011-06-02T03:33:00.000Z	tanath	ZykoticK9	-minimal is there for a reason
2011-06-02T03:33:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	tanath	not for Ubuntu.
2011-06-02T03:33:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	tanath	minimal is debian without Ubuntu stuff, why not just install Debian?
2011-06-02T03:34:00.000Z	tanath	ZykoticK9	is it? hunh...
2011-06-02T03:34:00.000Z	tanath	ZykoticK9	i like ubuntu, i just don't want some of the apps -desktop depends on. like bluetooth stuff. my comp doesn't even support it
2011-06-02T03:35:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	tanath	oh i hear that!
2011-06-06T05:01:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	tanath	if you're using gnome, I'm really not surprised.  Best of luck.
2011-06-06T05:01:00.000Z	tanath	ZykoticK9	yes
2011-06-06T05:01:00.000Z	tanath	ZykoticK9	heh
2011-06-25T05:10:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	tanath	too bad Banshee is mono-contaminated ;)
2011-06-25T05:10:00.000Z	tanath	ZykoticK9	yeah, there is that, but it is a good player
2011-06-25T05:12:00.000Z	tanath	ZykoticK9	why do people still use numeric-form permissions when you can chmod +r, etc?
2011-06-25T05:12:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	tanath	i use both
2011-06-25T05:21:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	tanath	LOL - that does explain somethings
