2011-10-27T14:54:00.000Z	Satanaa	ikonia	i know, but its also kinda a racist ;p
2011-10-27T14:55:00.000Z	ikonia	Satanaa	that counts as bad language, so again, if you can't discuss it without using racist/swearing/offensive conversation, don't discuss it in this channel
2011-10-27T14:55:00.000Z	Satanaa	ikonia	copy/paste please :)
2011-10-27T14:55:00.000Z	ikonia	Satanaa	what ?
2011-10-27T14:58:00.000Z	Satanaa	ikonia	maybe you can help me?
2011-10-27T14:58:00.000Z	ikonia	Satanaa	if you explain your problem I can try
2011-10-27T14:59:00.000Z	ikonia	Satanaa	is the screenserver password protected ?
2011-10-27T14:59:00.000Z	Satanaa	ikonia	no
2011-10-27T15:00:00.000Z	ikonia	Satanaa	as a test, set it to be password protected, that way, when you move the mouse, if you get the password prompt box, you know it's picking up the trigger, if it doesn't you know you have a bug with the screensaver and it needs logging
2011-10-27T15:01:00.000Z	Satanaa	ikonia	i have tried all that, no go
2011-10-27T15:01:00.000Z	ikonia	Satanaa	so it doesn't show you the password box ?
2011-10-27T15:01:00.000Z	Satanaa	ikonia	it doesnt
2011-10-27T15:02:00.000Z	ikonia	Satanaa	sounds like it's not picking up the event, worth logging a bug against it
2011-10-27T15:02:00.000Z	ikonia	Satanaa	oooh really
2011-10-27T15:02:00.000Z	ikonia	Satanaa	what video card do you have ?
2011-10-27T15:03:00.000Z	ikonia	Satanaa	ok - I have a test for you, it's not nice.
2011-10-27T15:03:00.000Z	ikonia	Satanaa	can you change your xorg driver to "vesa"
2011-10-27T15:03:00.000Z	Satanaa	ikonia	do i dare?
2011-10-27T15:03:00.000Z	ikonia	Satanaa	it will make your desktop look rubbish in terms of effects, but see if it happens there too
2011-10-27T15:04:00.000Z	ikonia	Satanaa	it's not a good solution, but to me, it's a worthwhile test to eleminate some things
2011-10-27T15:23:00.000Z	Satanaa	ikonia	i dont know why, but i have a feeling its a pm-untils issue
