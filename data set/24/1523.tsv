2009-11-30T21:31:00.000Z	ratatim		 i'd like to know how to boot 8.10 from ISO without using a CD or USB. I'm running 8.04 Hardy
2009-11-30T21:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ratatim	 so you mean how to 'netboot' ?
2009-11-30T21:32:00.000Z	ratatim	Dr_Willis	if that's what that is, then yes
2009-11-30T21:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ratatim	 to boot an iso file you can do that with grub2.. but that would need a usb with grub2 installed on it
2009-11-30T21:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ratatim	 otherwise you are going to have to do some other type of booting
2009-11-30T21:33:00.000Z	ratatim	Dr_Willis	How can I enable my USB drive to mount a flash drive?
2009-11-30T21:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ratatim	 Huh?  I plug my flash drive in and ubuntu mounts it..
2009-11-30T21:34:00.000Z	ratatim	Dr_Willis	mine always says "Cannot mount volume"
2009-11-30T21:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ratatim	 could be a typo in /etc/fstab I had one install that had the cdrom as sdc  when sdc was the usb  drives
2009-11-30T21:35:00.000Z	ratatim	Dr_Willis	I'm quite the newbie. Should i type any specific command that would allow my USB drive to work? Sorry if i sound redundant
2009-11-30T21:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ratatim	 it should work automatically.
2009-11-30T21:36:00.000Z	ratatim	Dr_Willis	typing /etc/fstab?
2009-11-30T21:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ratatim	 No.. /etc/fstab defines mountpoints.
2009-11-30T21:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ratatim	 if you have more then 1 flash drive try plugging in all of them . see if any get auto mounted
2009-11-30T21:37:00.000Z	ratatim	Dr_Willis	I'll try that once I get home in a few hours.  What if that doesn't work?
2009-11-30T21:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ratatim	 No idea really. ive had issues with automopunting since beta.. still not sure whats crashing. they will automount for about 10 min.. then stop. If i logout/in then it goes back to automounting them
2009-11-30T21:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ratatim	 you could alwyas plug them in and mount them byhand
2009-11-30T21:39:00.000Z	ratatim	Dr_Willis	I'm using a Sandisk Cruzer. I've heard removing the U3 software from the flash drive will help.
2009-11-30T21:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ratatim	 the u3 stuff really screws things up the device shows up as a CD and a hard drive. I always repartition and get rid of the u3 stuff
2009-11-30T21:41:00.000Z	ratatim	Dr_Willis	Well i'm using a Kingston flash drive until I find my Sandisk. Once I find my Sandisk I'll remove U3 from it.
2009-11-30T21:41:00.000Z	ratatim	Dr_Willis	I'm a broke college kid.
2009-11-30T21:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ratatim	 2gb flash drive less then the cost of a meal at McDonolds this time of year
2009-11-30T21:42:00.000Z	ratatim	Dr_Willis	You're right. I could probably round up some funds for a new flash drive.
2009-11-30T21:44:00.000Z	ratatim	Dr_Willis	Is that all I need? A 2gb flash? I plan on using that to boot Jaunty on my computer. Oh, another question. Will I lose my information moving from 8.04 to 8.10?
