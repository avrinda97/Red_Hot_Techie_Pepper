2009-04-04T06:04:00.000Z	nigtv		okay, there is no -R option
2009-04-04T06:04:00.000Z	nigtv		i guess there is no way to recursively mv, but uhm
2009-04-04T06:04:00.000Z	nigtv		maybe if i find -exec mv
2009-04-04T06:04:00.000Z	nigtv		but im thinking that would put them all into one big directory
2009-04-04T06:04:00.000Z	unop	nigtv	why would you want to recursively mv something .. if you move the parent dir, you move all children anyway
2009-04-04T06:04:00.000Z	nigtv		well no, not exactly
2009-04-04T06:05:00.000Z	nigtv		ive unzipped this 7z, its about 8.6gb, otherwise i would love to try things out
2009-04-04T06:05:00.000Z	nigtv		but it takes about an hour whether it works or not
2009-04-04T06:05:00.000Z	nigtv		and im moving it from the ubuntu part to the xp part
2009-04-04T06:05:00.000Z	nigtv		even as sudo, mv only moves with depth 1
2009-04-04T06:05:00.000Z	unop	nigtv	so, wait, you want to move all files in subdirectories into a single destination?
2009-04-04T06:06:00.000Z	nigtv		no
2009-04-04T06:06:00.000Z	nigtv		mv and preserve path
2009-04-04T06:06:00.000Z	nigtv		and if i find -exec mv /media/disk/blahblah
2009-04-04T06:06:00.000Z	nigtv		no, tried that
2009-04-04T06:06:00.000Z	nigtv		doesnt work
2009-04-04T06:06:00.000Z	nigtv		not like you think it would
2009-04-04T06:07:00.000Z	nigtv		well, then why isnt it moving recursively on my machine, argusususus
2009-04-04T06:07:00.000Z	unop	nigtv	  find -depth path/to/somedir | cpio -pdumv path/to/another_dir
2009-04-04T06:08:00.000Z	nigtv		lemme check that out
2009-04-04T06:08:00.000Z	nigtv		yea, its mounted the same time every time
2009-04-04T06:08:00.000Z	nigtv		by me by hand
2009-04-04T06:09:00.000Z	nigtv	unop	i might need a little more specific example, as i cant really just try it, you know? because its 9~gb, maybe in pm, i could give you more specific information
2009-04-04T06:10:00.000Z	unop	nigtv	perhaps ..
