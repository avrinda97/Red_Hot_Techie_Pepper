2008-07-19T02:55:00.000Z	jlewis		can someone help me set my DNS to 208.67.222.222,208.67.220.220; ? Each time i enter it into my Network Settings it reverts back to a previous DNS. Help!
2008-07-19T02:57:00.000Z	jlewis		How can I change my DNS permanently?
2008-07-19T02:57:00.000Z	crimsun_	jlewis	you need to uncomment the #prepend domain-name-servers 127.0.0.1;  line in /etc/dhcp3/dhclient.conf and change it
2008-07-19T03:01:00.000Z	crimsun_	jlewis	remove the leading hash ('#') from the line
2008-07-19T03:05:00.000Z	jlewis	crimsun_	when I go to change my DNS in the Network Settings, I delete the 3 that are there, add the two from OpenDNS, and close it. Then I go back to it and the 3 original DNS's are there again. Why?
2008-07-19T03:06:00.000Z	crimsun_	jlewis	because you're supposed to add them in /etc/dhcp3/dhclient.conf.  network-manager overwrites whatever changes you make to /etc/resolv.conf (unless you use resolvconf, which is another bag of bones).
2008-07-19T03:08:00.000Z	jlewis	crimsun_	I did what you said to do in the /etc/dhcp3/dhclient.conf. and it still that the original 3 DNS settings there. IS there something I am missing?
2008-07-19T03:10:00.000Z	crimsun_	jlewis	pastebin that file
2008-07-19T03:10:00.000Z	jlewis	crimsun_	how do i do that?
2008-07-19T03:11:00.000Z	crimsun_	jlewis	apt-get install pastebinit
2008-07-19T03:13:00.000Z	jlewis	crimsun_	O.K, doing it now. What is this doing?
2008-07-19T03:13:00.000Z	crimsun_	jlewis	downloading and installing a packaeg
2008-07-19T03:14:00.000Z	jlewis	crimsun_	O.K, it is done. Now what?
2008-07-19T03:14:00.000Z	crimsun_	jlewis	use it to paste that file
2008-07-19T03:14:00.000Z	jlewis	crimsun_	How do i get at tit to past it? Which program do I use?
2008-07-19T03:15:00.000Z	crimsun_	jlewis	terminal
2008-07-19T03:17:00.000Z	jlewis	crimsun_	All I get is pastebinit v0.9, with a bunch of opptimal arguments. Am I missing a step?
2008-07-19T03:17:00.000Z	crimsun_	jlewis	well, are you passing the correct filename to the program?
2008-07-19T03:18:00.000Z	crimsun_	jlewis	pastebinit /etc/dhcp3/dhclient.conf
2008-07-19T03:19:00.000Z	jlewis	crimsun_	http://pastebin.com/f67a50959
2008-07-19T03:20:00.000Z	crimsun_	jlewis	you'd need to go single-user then multi-user, or down and up the interface, or reboot
2008-07-19T03:21:00.000Z	jlewis	crimsun_	so If I reboot it should work?
2008-07-19T03:21:00.000Z	crimsun_	jlewis	or init 1, then init 2
2008-07-19T03:21:00.000Z	crimsun_	jlewis	(yes)
