2006-09-27T14:49:00.000Z	wols_	kitche	the word you looked for is "anal retentive". sometimes obssessive compulsive. not just "an ass"
2007-05-29T11:17:00.000Z	kitche	wols_	well it also uses DDR
2007-05-29T11:18:00.000Z	wols_	kitche	not i810, no
2007-05-29T11:18:00.000Z	kitche	wols_	so your point is wrong since I just told you what my board is and the memory I have plus the processor
2007-05-29T11:21:00.000Z	wols_	kitche	you do NOT have a i810 chipset and a P4 celery. i810 is purely P3 and it is SDRAM only. http://www.intel.com/design/chipsets/mature/index.htm?iid=ipp_810chpst+hghlt_chart&
2007-05-29T11:21:00.000Z	kitche	wols_	odd how my video is i810 onboard
2007-05-29T11:21:00.000Z	wols_	kitche	what you might have is a i845
2007-05-29T11:21:00.000Z	kitche	wols_	nope i810 according to hp's website
2007-05-29T11:21:00.000Z	wols_	kitche	the i810 driver can be used for many different IGPs
2007-05-29T11:22:00.000Z	wols_	kitche	don't confuse the chipset you use and the video driver you use. and if you have a P4 you cannot run i810 chipset, preiod
2007-05-29T11:22:00.000Z	wols_	kitche	look up the url I pasted from intel.
2007-05-29T11:22:00.000Z	kitche	wols_	whatever I know what the hp website says
2007-05-29T11:23:00.000Z	wols_	kitche	your i845 graphics core used the i810 driver as well. that's all
2007-05-29T11:27:00.000Z	kitche	wols_	thanks for giving me a link that actually killed links have to fix it now lol
2007-05-29T11:28:00.000Z	kitche	wols_	just had ot exit and logout :)
2007-05-29T11:31:00.000Z	wols_	kitche	vlc has been developed from ground up on windows, *nix and OSX
2007-05-29T11:32:00.000Z	kitche	wols_	good for you I just said it's been ported over to windows which can mean it was reprogrammed from the ground up but anyways your ignored now
2007-06-17T13:58:00.000Z	kitche	wols_	that is what I asked him
2007-06-17T13:59:00.000Z	kitche	wols_	sicne all he's missing is Load "glx" from his xorg.conf
2007-06-17T14:13:00.000Z	kitche	wols_	he's using the open source nv driver right now but for some reason his system does not like glx with the driver
2008-07-21T21:19:00.000Z	wols_	kitche	can ath5k-pci finally TX packets?
2008-07-21T21:20:00.000Z	kitche	wols_	no clue but that's what madwifi is now since madwifi project is no longer being "developed"
2008-07-21T21:20:00.000Z	wols_	kitche	ath5k-pci is not ready for primetime
2008-07-21T21:20:00.000Z	kitche	wols_	I know the original version can not sure about the port
