2010-09-26T09:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	_genuser_	Do you have a flash drive?
2010-09-26T09:04:00.000Z	_genuser_	Jordan_U	basically the livecd running and the iso downloading. I thought I'd mount the iso as cdrom and run the installer.
2010-09-26T09:04:00.000Z	Jordan_U	_genuser_	It doesn't work that way unforunately.
2010-09-26T09:04:00.000Z	_genuser_	Jordan_U	oh, it won't install even if you manually run the installer?
2010-09-26T09:05:00.000Z	Jordan_U	_genuser_	You'll need to boot from the kubuntu iso to install kubuntu (or install Xubuntu then install kubuntu-desktop).
2010-09-26T09:05:00.000Z	Jordan_U	_genuser_	*but*, you can boot from the kubuntu iso without burning it to a CD.
2010-09-26T09:05:00.000Z	_genuser_	Jordan_U	ok, how would one go about that?
2010-09-26T09:08:00.000Z	_genuser_	Jordan_U	so how do I boot from kubuntu iso without burning to cd?
2010-09-26T09:08:00.000Z	Jordan_U	_genuser_	There are a few ways. If you have a flash drive, the easiest is to use the boot disk utility that comes on the Xubuntu CD (I don't know where it is in the menus for Xubuntu though).
2010-09-26T09:08:00.000Z	_genuser_	Jordan_U	sorry, you were typing the response. :)
2010-09-26T09:08:00.000Z	Jordan_U	_genuser_	:)
2010-09-26T09:08:00.000Z	_genuser_	Jordan_U	ok, to locate a flash drive....
2010-09-26T09:08:00.000Z	_genuser_	Jordan_U	thanks for your help.
2010-09-26T09:09:00.000Z	Jordan_U	_genuser_	You're welcome. In Gnome the utility is System > Administration > Startup Disk Creator. It's probably something similar on Xubuntu.
2010-09-26T09:10:00.000Z	_genuser_	Jordan_U	gotta be in there in xfce. :)
2010-09-26T09:11:00.000Z	Jordan_U	_genuser_	I'm sure it is, I just don't know where it is in the menus.
2010-09-26T09:33:00.000Z	Jordan_U	_genuser_	Has the drive ever been used as part of a RAID array?
2010-09-26T09:35:00.000Z	Jordan_U	_genuser_	The Ubuntu installer ignores drives that have RAID metadata that it can't understand, as if it *is* part of an array then writing to just one drive would be very bad.
2010-09-26T09:35:00.000Z	_genuser_	Jordan_U	no, it's brand new. I just tried it with ubuntu installer and it was working fine. Only reason it's stopped was that CD wasn't readable.
2010-09-26T09:35:00.000Z	_genuser_	Jordan_U	but with xubuntu installer, it comes up blank.
2010-09-26T09:36:00.000Z	Jordan_U	_genuser_	Odd. Same Ubuntu release (10.04.1)?
2010-09-26T09:36:00.000Z	_genuser_	Jordan_U	same. both 8.0 installer.
2010-09-26T09:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U	_genuser_	Why are you installing 8.04 rather than 10.04.1 ?
2010-09-26T09:37:00.000Z	_genuser_	Jordan_U	lol, 'coz 8.0 is the only one I have on CD burnt.
