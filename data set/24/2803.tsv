2009-08-20T01:20:00.000Z	rblst		guest access checkbox is greyed out when i try to share a folder in hardy, how can i enable it?
2009-08-20T01:21:00.000Z	guntbert	rblst	I guess IdleOne was being ironic - you should repeat your question only after 10~15 minutes please
2009-08-20T01:22:00.000Z	rblst	guntbert	thanks for defining 'quickly' for me
2009-08-20T01:24:00.000Z	guntbert	rblst	:-) - I'm not defining anything - but otherwise the channel becomes even more busy - good luck to you
2009-08-20T01:25:00.000Z	rblst	guntbert	thank you
2009-08-20T01:27:00.000Z	guntbert	rblst	are you trying to share a folder from your home directory?
2009-08-20T01:28:00.000Z	rblst	guntbert	yes
2009-08-20T01:29:00.000Z	guntbert	rblst	silly question: you did enable "share this folder"?
2009-08-20T01:30:00.000Z	rblst	guntbert	yes, i did; it works in jaunty, but not in hardy :(
2009-08-20T01:31:00.000Z	guntbert	rblst	next try: is this just for one folder so or for everyone?
2009-08-20T01:32:00.000Z	rblst	guntbert	everyone, even for users that have admin privileges
2009-08-20T01:33:00.000Z	rblst	guntbert	i think i will add samba users, but it's not nice having to enter password all the time...
2009-08-20T01:33:00.000Z	guntbert	rblst	my question should have been: is this a problem with one particular folder or for every folder
2009-08-20T01:35:00.000Z	rblst	guntbert	i have tried it with several different folders (also of different users) and neither worked, which implies that it is the case with every folde
2009-08-20T01:36:00.000Z	guntbert	rblst	I'm afraid you are right (didn't know your experience :-)), as I don't have access to a 8.04 at the moment - I have to give up, sorry
2009-08-20T01:38:00.000Z	rblst	guntbert	i appreciate your taking time to this
2009-08-20T01:40:00.000Z	guntbert	rblst	good luck
2010-07-13T02:21:00.000Z	rblst	guntbert	startupmanager does not have services
2010-07-13T02:21:00.000Z	guntbert	rblst	then I made an error - sorry
2010-07-13T02:22:00.000Z	guntbert	rblst	then it is bum, like DasEi said
2010-07-13T02:22:00.000Z	rblst	guntbert	that's the one, thanks
2010-09-13T00:07:00.000Z	guntbert	rblst	he probably wanted to tell you about #httpd
2010-09-13T00:08:00.000Z	guntbert	rblst	for apache support
2010-09-13T00:36:00.000Z	guntbert	rblst	you're welcome :-)
