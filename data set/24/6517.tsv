2008-12-12T09:18:00.000Z	azteech		anyone know of problem(s) with 8.10 livecd (amd64 desktop) not properly setting up video (nvidia GeForce 7300 GT) when it first boots up? And if so, is there a work around for it?
2008-12-12T09:18:00.000Z	Wyzard	azteech	It worked for me with an 8800GT, aside from the picture being poorly positioned (top part of the screen is cut off)
2008-12-12T09:20:00.000Z	azteech	Wyzard	everything points to possible detection issue. x.org recognizes the card just fine .. but when it gets up and running on the desktop, am limited to 800x600 @ 61hz ... with LTS livecd, recoginized my setup properly ...
2008-12-12T09:21:00.000Z	Wyzard	azteech	The free driver isn't perfect
2008-12-12T09:23:00.000Z	azteech	Wyzard	so are you possibly suggesting I go ahead with install then? That when it is installed video should work properly? Or, you saying it may, or may not function properly, and I should probably leave set up at 8.04 LTS with everything working correctly?
2008-12-12T09:24:00.000Z	Wyzard	azteech	On my 8800GT and its analog monitor, I've always had positioning issues with the free driver -- older versions shifted the picture too far to the left, and the current version shifts it up too far -- but the non-free driver works fine
2008-12-12T09:24:00.000Z	Wyzard	azteech	so if you intend to install the non-free driver I'd expect you'll probably be OK
2008-12-12T09:29:00.000Z	azteech	Wyzard	yeah, have experienced that issue myself ... but, this isn't a positioning issue. With 8.04 LTS amd64 desktop, worked out of the box .. with livecd and with full install, both the free and non-free drivers worked to set up video to proper vert/horz refresh ranges, and freq. out of the box. The 8.10 doesn't do that, nor come close to the 1400x900@60hz .. that I run, has me stuck at 800x600@61 ...... call me paranoid .. but seems to me that something b
2008-12-12T09:30:00.000Z	Wyzard	azteech	I'd take a look at xorg.0.log where it detects the monitor's capabilities
2008-12-12T09:31:00.000Z	Wyzard	azteech	1400x900 sounds like widescreen LCD
2008-12-12T09:31:00.000Z	azteech	Wyzard	it is ... have a HP widescreen monitor ..
2008-12-12T09:33:00.000Z	Wyzard	azteech	DVI is really preferable for LCDs
2008-12-12T09:33:00.000Z	azteech	Wyzard	and VGA cables are coupled to a KVM to allow switching between systems ...
2008-12-12T09:33:00.000Z	Wyzard	azteech	The KVM could be what's interfering with detecting the monitor's capabilties
2008-12-12T09:34:00.000Z	Wyzard	azteech	I'd definitely look at xorg.0.log to see what it says about the monitor
2008-12-12T09:34:00.000Z	azteech	Wyzard	I know they are, but until I can afford to get a DVI KVM switch ... am stuck with a VGA only option ... unless I want to fore-go dual systems at this point ...
2008-12-12T09:35:00.000Z	Wyzard	azteech	Try it with a direct connection without a KVM, just to see if it works
2008-12-12T09:36:00.000Z	azteech	Wyzard	yeah, once you mentioned that, I noted it and plan on it when I boot back into 8.10 livecd ... was focusing only on video and its rates and overlooked the other obvious error area ...
2008-12-12T09:37:00.000Z	azteech	Wyzard	hear ya ... and you are right, but ram isn't the issue, it is the mobo ... limited to 2GB .. until I can upgrade it ... then will get rid of the secondary system, which is the 32-bit x86 desktop ... use it for testing and such ...
2008-12-12T09:37:00.000Z	Wyzard	azteech	autodetecting video modes depends on querying the monitor its supported sync rates and preferred mode...  that's data coming back *from* the monitor, though VGA is primarily meant for sending signals *to* the monitor
2008-12-12T09:38:00.000Z	azteech	Wyzard	no, hadn't taken that approach either .. but also noted ... simple oversight of simple t/s steps ....
2008-12-12T09:38:00.000Z	azteech	Wyzard	which is why I didn't think of it being the monitor ....
2008-12-12T09:42:00.000Z	azteech	Wyzard	thanks for the input ..... (and gentle slap on back of the head) ... hee hee ...
2008-12-12T09:42:00.000Z	Wyzard	azteech	np  :-)
