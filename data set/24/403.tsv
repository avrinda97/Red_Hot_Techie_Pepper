2011-10-04T20:02:00.000Z	Emal		are you guys getting the bug where your keyboard and mouse freeze for a couple minutes on startup?
2011-10-04T20:03:00.000Z	Emal		on 11.04
2011-10-04T20:04:00.000Z	Emal		so no one has this problem on 11.04?
2011-10-04T20:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Emal	when it starts again, run:  dmesg | tail     see if it gives clues
2011-10-04T20:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Emal	I saw it in Oneiric in Alpha2
2011-10-04T20:05:00.000Z	Emal		what do you mean "when it starts again?"
2011-10-04T20:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Emal	well you say it freezes for a few minutes, so it recovers, right?
2011-10-04T20:05:00.000Z	Emal		yep
2011-10-04T20:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Emal	so, is that it not 'starting again'?
2011-10-04T20:06:00.000Z	Emal		the mouse, keyboard, and headset are off for a couple mins
2011-10-04T20:06:00.000Z	Emal		basically all USB connections are off
2011-10-04T20:06:00.000Z	Emal		momentarily
2011-10-04T20:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Emal	fine, but  do you see what I mean now?
2011-10-04T20:06:00.000Z	Emal		i understand, thank you
2011-10-04T20:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Emal	you may want to make sure your BIOS is up to date
2011-10-04T20:08:00.000Z	Emal		also I have not found a solution for my gpu issue
2011-10-04T20:08:00.000Z	Emal		how do I "use" my driver, it says it is only activated
2011-10-04T20:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Emal	which gpu are you using?
2011-10-04T20:10:00.000Z	Emal		GTX 260
2011-10-04T20:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Emal	I suggest you read through:  less /var/log/Xorg.0.log
2011-10-04T20:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Emal	you may need to run:  sudo nvidia-xconfig
2011-10-04T20:13:00.000Z	Emal		it still says it's not in use, ActionParsnip
2011-10-04T20:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Emal	you need to reboot to apply the new settings
2011-10-04T20:15:00.000Z	Emal	ActionParsnip	ok thanks.
