2009-01-19T06:48:00.000Z	disappearedng_	DasEi	1) I am not very new, 2) I need to recompile with CONFIG_UFS_FS_WRITE=y so that I can access my FFS systems
2009-01-19T06:49:00.000Z	DasEi	dano_	yes, xorg has changd but still 'listens' to xorg.conf
2009-01-19T06:50:00.000Z	DasEi		 disappearedng_:ok then, thought so because of your request for partis
2009-01-19T06:50:00.000Z	disappearedng_		yeah
2009-01-19T06:50:00.000Z	disappearedng_	DasEi	well when I recompiled my kernel in FreeBSD, there's a config file for me to pick options from
2009-01-19T06:50:00.000Z	disappearedng_		when I read the documentation it didn't say much, it just says it's located in debian/config/ARCH/
2009-01-19T06:51:00.000Z	disappearedng_	DasEi	Oh nvm
2009-01-19T06:52:00.000Z	DasEi		 disappearedng_:http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com/idea/6523/

2009-01-19T06:59:00.000Z	disappearedng_	DasEi	Where do I find   debian/config/i386/ then ?
2009-01-19T07:00:00.000Z	DasEi		 disappearedng_:no idea, but you can read ffs , nor ? try from live cd
2009-01-19T07:00:00.000Z	disappearedng_	DasEi	I can read but not write
2009-01-19T07:00:00.000Z	disappearedng_		it's on http://wiki.netbsd.se/How_to_mount_FFS_partition_under_Linux
2009-01-19T07:00:00.000Z	disappearedng_		it's actually pretty annoying
2009-01-19T07:03:00.000Z	DasEi		 disappearedng_:you could mount it ?
2009-01-19T07:03:00.000Z	disappearedng_		yeah
2009-01-19T07:04:00.000Z	DasEi		 disappearedng_:chown the directory it's mounted to to the regular user
2009-01-19T07:06:00.000Z	DasEi		 disappearedng_:assuming it's mounted /media/disk, will be : sudo chown -R  disappearedng /media/disk   (correct username, course)
2009-01-19T07:06:00.000Z	disappearedng_	DasEi	read only file system
2009-01-19T07:07:00.000Z	DasEi		 disappearedng_:was it set up like this ?
2009-01-19T07:07:00.000Z	disappearedng_	DasEi	I guess, I followed the guide http://wiki.netbsd.se/How_to_mount_FFS_partition_under_Linux completely
2009-01-19T07:09:00.000Z	DasEi		 disappearedng_:ufs is supported by mount (default)
