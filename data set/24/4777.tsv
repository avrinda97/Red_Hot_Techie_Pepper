2009-09-26T10:43:00.000Z	firecrotch	Prohibited	when GRUB loads, while the menu for which to boot comes up, press e (while the Ubuntu entry is highlighted) and give us the entire boot line. There's probably an error there
2009-09-26T10:55:00.000Z	firecrotch	Prohibited	That would be me
2009-09-26T11:00:00.000Z	Prohibited	firecrotch	you there?
2009-09-26T11:00:00.000Z	firecrotch	Prohibited	Yep
2009-09-26T11:01:00.000Z	firecrotch	Prohibited	that's all sorts of messed up.
2009-09-26T11:02:00.000Z	firecrotch	Prohibited	as far as I know, the best thing to do in your situation is do a fresh install of Ubuntu, instead of converting a Wubi install
2009-09-26T11:07:00.000Z	firecrotch	Prohibited	it could probably be fixed. What have you done so far in the process of trying to convert from a Wubi install to a normal install>
2009-09-26T11:14:00.000Z	firecrotch	Prohibited	can you give me a link to the instructions you were using?
2009-09-26T11:18:00.000Z	firecrotch	Prohibited	Unfortunately, your problem is a little too complex for me to handle (I'm not very good with GRUB stuff)
2009-09-26T11:19:00.000Z	firecrotch	Prohibited	I'm sure someone will :)
2009-09-26T11:20:00.000Z	firecrotch	Prohibited	almost everything works better in Ubuntu than in Windows :)
