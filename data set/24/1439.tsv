2010-01-19T00:57:00.000Z	isaac_		the config changed but i rebooted my computer and it changed resolution but won't go to 120hz!
2010-01-19T00:57:00.000Z	isaac_		why there is NO 120hz for 800x600 or 1024x768 why why?
2010-01-19T00:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip__	isaac_	there is if you define it in xorg.conf
2010-01-19T01:01:00.000Z	isaac_	ActionParsnip__	did you get my last message?
2010-01-19T01:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip__	isaac_	add the right data to xorg.confand it will be used
2010-01-19T01:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip__	isaac_	my client is configured to block PMs
2010-01-19T01:01:00.000Z	isaac_	ActionParsnip__	is my data wrong?
2010-01-19T01:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip__	isaac_	well if its not doing it then most likely yes
2010-01-19T01:02:00.000Z	isaac_	ActionParsnip__	my line is Option         "metamodes" "1024x768_120 +0+0"
2010-01-19T01:02:00.000Z	isaac_	ActionParsnip__	then what should i do?
2010-01-19T01:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip__	isaac_	do you have refresh rates defined in the monitor section?
2010-01-19T01:04:00.000Z	isaac_	ActionParsnip__	I don't think so but my monitor supports 120hz at 1024x768 for sure
2010-01-19T01:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip__	isaac_	it could do 2000Mhz if the file is not configured right it wont do it
2010-01-19T01:05:00.000Z	isaac_	ActionParsnip__	there is no 120hz in nvidia setting so thats why i wanted to edit it in so i have 120hz in my 1024x768
2010-01-19T01:05:00.000Z	isaac_	ActionParsnip__	so what exactly should I do?
2010-01-19T01:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip__	isaac_	then you will need to sidestep nvidia-settings
2010-01-19T01:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip__	isaac_	http://forums.fedoraforum.org/archive/index.php/t-95357.html   has a monitor section you can use
2010-01-19T01:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip__	isaac_	you can websearc round for xorg.conf examples to get the settings you want.
2010-01-19T01:06:00.000Z	isaac_	ActionParsnip__	okay i'm doing that now
2010-01-19T01:08:00.000Z	isaac_	ActionParsnip__	is it like getting right driver for the monitor than using default refresh?
2010-01-19T01:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip__	isaac_	you have the right driver, you just need to give it better settings
2010-01-19T01:18:00.000Z	isaac_	ActionParsnip__	 --> # nvidia-settings: X configuration file generated by nvidia-settings
2010-01-19T03:58:00.000Z	isaac_	ActionParsnip__	 hey!!
2010-01-19T03:58:00.000Z	isaac_	ActionParsnip__	i'm still trying to add mode on xrandr
