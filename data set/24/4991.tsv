2006-12-09T07:48:00.000Z	jrib	cmweb	ok, see the beginning? d means directory, rwx is for the owner, r-x is for the group and, the last r-x is for others.  You group odes no have write permissions

2006-12-16T17:53:00.000Z	jrib	cmweb	does that page help you?
2006-12-16T17:54:00.000Z	cmweb	jrib	nope
2006-12-16T17:54:00.000Z	jrib	cmweb	but it tells you how to setup Php5 with Apache.  What step doesn't work?
2006-12-16T17:55:00.000Z	jrib	cmweb	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP#head-59bdeb1f6438eddbde544b41ca0a5149c59624b6
2006-12-16T17:55:00.000Z	cmweb	jrib	i only see php5 with mysql
2006-12-16T17:57:00.000Z	cmweb	jrib	i guess it works... i didnt have libapache2-mod-php5
2006-12-16T07:02:00.000Z	jrib	cmweb	I *think* it won't be setup to use php with .phtml files, see if it works if you rename it to .php.  Or is it already named that?
2006-12-16T07:05:00.000Z	jrib	cmweb	did you restart apache?
2006-12-16T07:06:00.000Z	jrib	cmweb	do you have apache installed as well as apache2?
2006-12-16T07:06:00.000Z	cmweb	jrib	no i only did apache 2 *this time*
2006-12-16T07:07:00.000Z	cmweb	jrib	it wouldent matter any way i only loaded a apache 2 command
2006-12-16T07:07:00.000Z	jrib	cmweb	the servers start on their own
2006-12-16T07:07:00.000Z	cmweb	jrib	dont worry i only did apache 2
2006-12-16T07:08:00.000Z	jrib	cmweb	clear your browser cache? or try a different one
