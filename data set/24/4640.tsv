2007-03-03T10:17:00.000Z	sm0k3d		hey guys
2007-03-03T10:19:00.000Z	sm0k3d		i just have a quick question... i am going to install ubuntu to make a server, would kubuntu or xubuntu or edubuntu be *better or easyer* for me learning linux and how to make a server
2007-03-03T10:20:00.000Z	sm0k3d		ok so regular ubuntu is the way to go
2007-03-03T10:20:00.000Z	gyaresu	sm0k3d	Have you installed linux before?
2007-03-03T10:20:00.000Z	gyaresu	sm0k3d	What type of services are you trying to setup?
2007-03-03T10:21:00.000Z	gyaresu	sm0k3d	You will benefit from a desktop if you've never installed linux before for many reasons. One of which is that people trying to help you can also point you to some Graffical User Interface tools.
2007-03-03T10:22:00.000Z	sm0k3d	gyaresu	so i shouldnt install ubuntu server, but the desktop one?
2007-03-03T10:23:00.000Z	gyaresu	sm0k3d	You will find it easier but it's not necessary. You will just need to learn to drive everything from the command line.

2007-03-03T10:38:00.000Z	sm0k3d	gyaresu	i have a question on the server install, it is asking me if i want to install DNS server or LAMP server. which is just like ftp, http, etc. server?  im looking in the help.unbuntu.com but i dont see anything that can shed any light on eather one.
2007-03-03T10:39:00.000Z	gyaresu	sm0k3d	eck He may want all of them... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)
2007-03-03T10:41:00.000Z	sm0k3d	gyaresu	ahh ok, and what would DNS do for me?
2007-03-03T10:41:00.000Z	gyaresu	sm0k3d	Handy if you want to 'resolve domainnames' from your server rather than using your ISP's DNS 'server'.
2007-03-03T10:42:00.000Z	sm0k3d	gyaresu	ok, thanks for your help
2007-03-03T10:42:00.000Z	gyaresu	sm0k3d	If you are installing on a spare machine you might want to check out a guide that you can follow from howtoforge. I'll find a link.
2007-03-03T10:44:00.000Z	sm0k3d	gyaresu	yea im installing on a semi-old computer that isnt really used, also i just finished installing the ubuntu on the box.
2007-03-03T10:48:00.000Z	gyaresu	sm0k3d	http://www.howtoforge.com/perfect_setup_ubuntu_6.10_p2 or http://www.howtoforge.com/ubuntu_debian_lamp_server
2007-03-03T11:17:00.000Z	gyaresu	sm0k3d	There is: http://www.tuxfiles.org/linuxhelp/vimcheat.html
2007-03-03T11:12:00.000Z	sm0k3d	gyaresu	im following the howto link u sent me, it tells me to edit a file, but how do i save and close the file?
2007-03-03T11:12:00.000Z	sm0k3d	gyaresu	the howtoforge
2007-03-03T11:12:00.000Z	gyaresu	sm0k3d	Did you say you had a linux machine already installed?
2007-03-03T11:13:00.000Z	sm0k3d	gyaresu	yea i installed it, it took like 15 min
2007-03-03T11:14:00.000Z	gyaresu	sm0k3d	well if you open up a terminal on that machine then you can learn how to use vim (command line text editor) by running the 'vimtutor' command. I'd try that first. I think you need to play around on the installed machine for a bit and learn some basics. IMHO.
