2010-01-01T04:42:00.000Z	al_		any scripting gurus here? I want to impliment a rsync that runs between certain hours and stops during business hours.
2010-01-01T04:42:00.000Z	mister_roboto	al_	kick off your rsync at the right times using cron
2010-01-01T04:44:00.000Z	al_	mister_roboto	yes, but the rsync, if still running needs to be killed.....losha - exactely
2010-01-01T04:45:00.000Z	mister_roboto	al_	 losha: huh?  it just runs to completions and stop. i use it on my wife's computer to do her backups
2010-01-01T04:45:00.000Z	mister_roboto	al_	you don't want to stop the daemon if that's what you're using
2010-01-01T04:45:00.000Z	mister_roboto	al_	rsync isn't something that continuously synchronizes stuff, if that's what you think
2010-01-01T04:45:00.000Z	al_	mister_roboto	I am talking about rsync on a nas with a fairly slow processor. After a weekly full backup it may take 2-3 days to rsync
2010-01-01T04:46:00.000Z	mister_roboto	al_	ummmm why are you doing a full backup with rsync?
2010-01-01T04:46:00.000Z	al_	mister_roboto	thats why it needs to be stopped, and "resumed"
2010-01-01T04:47:00.000Z	mister_roboto	al_	anyway, you can easily just kill it with cron as well, a few minutes later or whatever. nothing about cron precludes doing that
2010-01-01T04:47:00.000Z	al_	mister_roboto	I have a NAS which receives weekly full and hourly (between 9-5) incremental backups. I need to copy this data from the NAS to a USB attached disk
2010-01-01T04:49:00.000Z	al_	mister_roboto	or the other way would be some fancy script to copy the backup files, only retaining 2 weeks worth of backups immediately after the weekly full. THis will be a lot faster than rsync, THEN use rsync on the incrementals each night. Would that work?
2010-01-01T04:51:00.000Z	mister_roboto	al_	i don't think so if rsync didn't do the original full backup. but you might get something to work if you hack at it long enough :D
2010-01-01T04:51:00.000Z	al_	mister_roboto	oh really...I didnt know that. If it didnt put the file there, then it rejects it? stink
2010-01-01T04:52:00.000Z	mister_roboto	al_	i don't know for sure and cannot say without trying it
2010-01-01T04:53:00.000Z	al_	mister_roboto	right. but you can see what the advantage of doing it that way (copy/synch combo) would be right? Youd complete the weekly full backup quickly, then leave rsync to take care of the hourly incrementals....
2010-01-01T04:53:00.000Z	al_	mister_roboto	if it worked....
2010-01-01T04:54:00.000Z	mister_roboto	al_	yes, i understand why you want to go that route. just never tried it and am not sure of the behavior
2010-01-01T04:56:00.000Z	mister_roboto	al_	it looks like you can use the --checksum option to compare checksums, in whcih case i can see it working
2010-01-01T04:57:00.000Z	al_	mister_roboto	right. As you say, I need to have a fiddle :-)
2010-01-01T04:58:00.000Z	mister_roboto	al_	it would be easy to test that. just copy one (big) file, rsync using checksum and verify that it doesn't transfer it
2010-01-01T04:59:00.000Z	al_	mister_roboto	exactely
2010-01-01T05:05:00.000Z	mister_roboto	al_	i'm actually curious to know if you can get that scheme to work using only the mod time / size checks. i expect copying the files over manually will mess up the mod time check
2010-01-01T05:06:00.000Z	al_	mister_roboto	youd know better than me! I am no CLI expert. Not even a newbie!!
