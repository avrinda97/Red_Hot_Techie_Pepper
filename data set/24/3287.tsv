2008-04-05T04:36:00.000Z	unop_	fr0nk_	maybe this .. ps -o %n%p | grep -i $1 | awk '{print $1}'
2008-04-05T04:36:00.000Z	unop_	fr0nk_	$1 being the pid you want to grep
2008-04-05T04:41:00.000Z	fr0nk_	unop_	thanks but this doesn't work:  ps -o %n%p outputs 2 lines:
2008-04-05T04:41:00.000Z	fr0nk_	unop_	 NI   PID
2008-04-05T04:42:00.000Z	unop_	fr0nk_	right, so you have two PIDs, what do you want me to do about that? :)
2008-04-05T04:43:00.000Z	unop_	fr0nk_	maybe i am not understanding you right -- perhaps you need to explain more about that there
2008-04-05T04:43:00.000Z	fr0nk_	unop_	ps -o %n%p | grep -i $1 | awk '{print $1}' greps in second instance for the name i want the nice-value of (vmware-vmx, for example). in the data it recieves from ps there is no application name grep could grep for ;-)
2008-04-05T04:44:00.000Z	unop_	fr0nk_	and you didnt use a numeric PID there not a processes name ..
2008-04-05T04:44:00.000Z	unop_	fr0nk_	ps blah .. | grep -i $PID | awk ..
2008-04-05T04:45:00.000Z	fr0nk_	unop_	passing the script a pid doesn't wrk either
2008-04-05T04:45:00.000Z	unop_	fr0nk_	if you want to grep for names -- then you need ..  ps a -o %n%a | grep -i $PROCESSNAME | awk ..
2008-04-05T04:45:00.000Z	fr0nk_	unop_	frank@Lysistrata {~} $ niceof `pidof vmware-vmx`
2008-04-05T04:46:00.000Z	unop_	fr0nk_	try adding the 'a' option to ps --   ps a -o %n%p | grep ..
2008-04-05T04:49:00.000Z	fr0nk_	unop_	ps a -0 %n%p doesn't give me all processes
2008-04-05T04:49:00.000Z	unop_	fr0nk_	i dunno how you got -0 there?  it's -o not -0
2008-04-05T04:50:00.000Z	fr0nk_	unop_	oh sorry, mistyped it in irrsi but on the bash i used -o ;)
2008-04-05T04:51:00.000Z	unop_	fr0nk_	well, there's obviously something missing then -- anyway, use some option of ps (man ps) to include nice outputs too, then grep for what you want
2008-04-05T04:54:00.000Z	unop_	fr0nk_	have a look at this, it has to have what you want in it...   ps ax -o %n%p%a
2008-04-05T04:56:00.000Z	fr0nk_	unop_	i got it! :-)
2008-04-05T04:56:00.000Z	unop_	fr0nk_	right, what was it?
2008-04-05T04:56:00.000Z	fr0nk_	unop_	if you're interested: frank@Lysistrata {~} $ ps -eo %n%p | grep `pidof vmware-vmx`
2008-04-05T04:57:00.000Z	unop_	fr0nk_	you must be careful tho -- `pidof vmware-vmx` can be any number that  your ps command's output can contain
2008-04-05T04:57:00.000Z	unop_	fr0nk_	it's best if you position your ps output by fields and extract the field you are interested in
2008-04-05T04:59:00.000Z	unop_	fr0nk_	what i mean is what if `pidof vmware..` returns something less than 20 ? :)
