2010-09-29T12:03:00.000Z	gartral	\DSAFEW\	my liabrary sucks, all their computers are locked in steel desks, and they have download blockers so you cant download anything
2010-09-29T12:03:00.000Z	\DSAFEW\	gartral	what do you have access to?
2010-09-29T12:03:00.000Z	\DSAFEW\	gartral	IRC?
2010-09-29T12:04:00.000Z	gartral	\DSAFEW\	irssi, fsck, /boot is a seperate hd thank god, and a few games
2010-09-29T12:07:00.000Z	gartral	\DSAFEW\	i have a droid, that's what i can transfer downloaded stuff from, but verizon is so damn slow i don't want to do anything that might not work
2010-09-29T12:07:00.000Z	\DSAFEW\	gartral	I'm looking for a static build of wget for you. That would help.
2010-09-29T12:21:00.000Z	\DSAFEW\	gartral	wait, how are you online if you only have irssi?
2010-09-29T12:21:00.000Z	\DSAFEW\	gartral	I meant, extensively what is available?
2010-09-29T12:21:00.000Z	gartral	\DSAFEW\	what do you mean? look at my ip, i'm on with my phone
2010-09-29T12:22:00.000Z	\DSAFEW\	gartral	so your irssi is on the phone?
2010-09-29T12:22:00.000Z	gartral	\DSAFEW\	yes, it's just a single program, i've been working on porting it for some time.. it's a pain
2010-09-29T12:23:00.000Z	\DSAFEW\	gartral	so what's not working? computer only has a /boot right?
2010-09-29T12:25:00.000Z	gartral	\DSAFEW\	the main / partition has som 200000+ bad sectors. it screwed up ff, chrome, apt, dpkg, wget, nexuiz, and most of my nautilus. but, other things work fine, like irssi on the comp, and a few games.. and wine
2010-09-29T12:27:00.000Z	\DSAFEW\	gartral	I see, wow, so have you scoured your bins for networking programs like netcat and lynx?
2010-09-29T12:28:00.000Z	\DSAFEW\	gartral	I can get you the static wget for windows, not sure if wine will run it
2010-09-29T12:29:00.000Z	gartral	\DSAFEW\	neither work, wget is screwed, w3m works, but that's next-to-crud..
2010-09-29T12:30:00.000Z	gartral	\DSAFEW\	im not sure how to make it work, but i cant install, apt and dkpg are borked
2010-09-29T12:31:00.000Z	\DSAFEW\	gartral	right, well, can you decompress a tarball?
2010-09-29T12:32:00.000Z	gartral	\DSAFEW\	just tryed, no, tar is throwing bus error
2010-09-29T12:35:00.000Z	\DSAFEW\	gartral	can you use mount isofs and loopback devices?
2010-09-29T12:37:00.000Z	gartral	\DSAFEW\	if i had the usable space for an iso, im only seeing about 300 mb that are free and not corrupt
2010-09-29T12:37:00.000Z	\DSAFEW\	gartral	oooh... what about the /boot drive?
