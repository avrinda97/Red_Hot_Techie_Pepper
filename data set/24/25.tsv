2012-11-09T23:19:00.000Z	Maddin		hello everybody! Maybe somebody can help me to fix a problem: I try to install some programs which need certain packages (eg g++) but I canÂ´t install the packages because there are "unmet dependencies". I tried to manually install the dependencies, no success, even they have deps on some packages where version conflicts occur. Anybody knows how to fix this?
2012-11-09T23:20:00.000Z	Seveas	Maddin	how are you trying to install g++? apt-get should handle all dependencies for you
2012-11-09T23:21:00.000Z	Maddin	Seveas	yes I did use apt-get but as I said there are version conflicts. It rejects to install the package.
2012-11-09T23:21:00.000Z	Seveas	Maddin	pastebin the full output please
2012-11-09T23:25:00.000Z	Maddin	Seveas	I posted the output
2012-11-09T23:25:00.000Z	Seveas	Maddin	where? :)
2012-11-09T23:26:00.000Z	Maddin	Seveas	there should be a new item here in IRC
2012-11-09T23:26:00.000Z	Seveas	Maddin	no, pastebin posts don't get announced automatically, just give us the url
2012-11-09T23:26:00.000Z	Maddin	Seveas	(privat message, whatvever it is called)
2012-11-09T23:28:00.000Z	Seveas	Maddin	can you pastebin the output of apt-get install g++-4.1 and the output of more /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list.d/* | cat
2012-11-09T23:32:00.000Z	Maddin	Seveas	http://paste.ubuntu.com/1345851/ and http://paste.ubuntu.com/1345857/
2012-11-09T23:34:00.000Z	Seveas	Maddin	ah, I got the first command wrong, should be: sudo apt-get install g++-4.4
2012-11-09T23:34:00.000Z	Maddin	Seveas	already wondered... :)
2012-11-09T23:34:00.000Z	Seveas	Maddin	btw, you're using an obsolete, unsupported version of ubuntu, an upgrade is recommended
2012-11-09T23:35:00.000Z	Maddin	Seveas	I know but Ubuntu 10.10 is the only version where my graphics card works as it should
2012-11-09T23:35:00.000Z	Seveas	Maddin	k, then we'll try to keep it working. Any luck with that apt-get? (pastebin please)
2012-11-09T23:36:00.000Z	Maddin	Seveas	there we go: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1345870/
2012-11-09T23:41:00.000Z	Seveas	Maddin	looks like you had updates enabled at some point but not anymore. This is fixable :)
2012-11-09T23:41:00.000Z	Seveas	Maddin	replace the contents of /etc/apt/sources.list with what's on http://pastebin.com/CL2mcCXV
2012-11-09T23:43:00.000Z	Maddin	Seveas	oh ok, but I did update to the newest packages but disabled the option after that that it doesnt bother me with asking each time
2012-11-09T23:43:00.000Z	Seveas	Maddin	you shouldn't disable that, those updates are important
2012-11-09T23:48:00.000Z	Maddin	Seveas	:O I have some updates available, NICE! Sorry for that dump action, I will let the system update now and tell you then...
2012-11-10T00:12:00.000Z	Maddin	Seveas	Thank you very much for your help! It works now, after the update finished I can install all the packages I need. :) You rock!
2012-11-10T00:23:00.000Z	Seveas	Maddin	you're welcome :)
