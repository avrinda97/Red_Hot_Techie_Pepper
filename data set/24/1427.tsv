2010-03-20T01:25:00.000Z	obscurant1st	Slart	its not like startup applications, i meant services like httpd, squid etc they are not showin in startups
2010-03-20T01:25:00.000Z	Slart	obscurant1st	try that one instead
2010-03-20T01:25:00.000Z	obscurant1st	Slart	will try, thx
2010-03-20T01:30:00.000Z	obscurant1st	Slart	thx mate, bum really worked
2010-03-20T01:31:00.000Z	Slart	obscurant1st	nice.. never tried it myself
2010-03-20T01:31:00.000Z	obscurant1st	Slart	lol, anyways i heard that there is a file by which we can edit the services? is there something like that?
2010-03-20T01:33:00.000Z	Slart	obscurant1st	not that I know of.. there are lots of files in /etc that handle what gets started and what doesn't.. /etc/rc.d comes to mind but I think there are others too
2010-03-20T01:34:00.000Z	Slart	obscurant1st	ahem.. that would be /etc/rc0.d , /etc/rc1.d, /etc/rc2.d and so on.. they all contain small scripts for starting stuff
2010-03-20T01:35:00.000Z	Slart	obscurant1st	but I think bum is just an easier way of working with all those small scripts
2010-03-20T01:35:00.000Z	obscurant1st	Slart	yes, better to use bum only!! :D
2010-06-28T14:03:00.000Z	Slart	obscurant1st	noone seems to know.. there's even a bug reported for it
