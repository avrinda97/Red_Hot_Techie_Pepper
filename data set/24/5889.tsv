2007-12-13T04:34:00.000Z	kameron		how do you fdisk /mbr from linux? i think there's a grub option but i forget how
2007-12-13T04:35:00.000Z	kling0n	kameron	why not just re-write the grub install ?
2007-12-13T04:35:00.000Z	kling0n	kameron	sudo update-grub
2007-12-13T04:35:00.000Z	kameron	kling0n	i need to install windows booatlader
2007-12-13T04:36:00.000Z	kling0n	kameron	you could just add the window boot option to your grub setup :)
2007-12-13T04:36:00.000Z	kling0n	kameron	ok
2007-12-13T04:37:00.000Z	kling0n	kameron	do you have a backup of the mbr ?
2007-12-13T04:38:00.000Z	kling0n	kameron	can you describe the problem in a bit more detail then? what happens if you try to chainload windows throught grub?
2007-12-13T04:40:00.000Z	kameron	kling0n	im not trying to chainload through grub. i ghosted a hard drive and i need to install windows bootloader to it. ther'es a grub command for this but i cant remember it.
2007-12-13T04:42:00.000Z	kling0n	kameron	can't help you much there.... if you dont have a backup of the mbr, I don't understand what you want to write.. the command would bd "dd" something
2007-12-13T04:42:00.000Z	kameron	kling0n	it's like.. "grub install-mbr /dev/hda" or something. installs windows bootloader.
2007-12-13T04:44:00.000Z	kling0n	kameron	are you sure? I can't find anything like that in the grub documentations
2007-12-13T04:44:00.000Z	kling0n	kameron	at least not if you want to write a windows mbr.. .you can write a grub mbr with that command jsut fine though
2007-12-13T04:45:00.000Z	kling0n	kameron	there's a discussion here:http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=24113
2007-12-13T04:46:00.000Z	kameron	kling0n	not what im looking for..
2007-12-13T04:47:00.000Z	kling0n	kameron	well if you want to install  a windows mbr you need a backup of one such
2007-12-13T04:47:00.000Z	kling0n	kameron	but there is no windows boot code included with grub or available from grub-isntall
2007-12-13T04:47:00.000Z	kling0n	kameron	you can use the 'dd' command to do direct disk writes but you need a dump of a windows  mbr in order to have something to write
2007-12-13T04:49:00.000Z	kling0n	kameron	maybe you are looking for install-mbr ?
2007-12-13T04:49:00.000Z	kling0n	kameron	that has nothing to do with grub thougb
2007-12-13T04:51:00.000Z	kling0n	kameron	install-mbr -kr /dev/<harddisk device> would reset the mbr
2007-12-13T04:52:00.000Z	kameron	kling0n	i gues you don't understand the problem.
2007-12-13T04:52:00.000Z	kling0n	kameron	that last command will rest the mbr... you could try that
2007-12-13T04:54:00.000Z	kling0n	kameron	you're welcome
