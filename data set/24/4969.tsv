2008-10-08T23:57:00.000Z	Frijolie		I'm trying to install a tarball and am getting an error during compile. Could not find the gnomeConf.sh file that is generated by gnome-libs install
2008-10-08T23:57:00.000Z	Frijolie		I've got the build-essential package installed...any ideas?
2008-10-08T23:57:00.000Z	MrKennie	Frijolie	you need to install the relevant *-dev packages
2008-10-08T23:58:00.000Z	Frijolie	MrKennie	how do you know what the relevant packages are?
2008-10-08T23:59:00.000Z	MrKennie	Frijolie	use synaptics to search for them or use apt-cache search in a terminal
2008-10-08T23:59:00.000Z	MrKennie	Frijolie	I think you need libgnome2-dev in your case but that should give you a clue for any further requirments
2008-10-08T23:59:00.000Z	Frijolie	MrKennie	how do you know what *dev files I need to fix the error
2008-10-09T00:00:00.000Z	Frijolie	MrKennie	I'm installing libgnome2-dev metapackage now..I'll see if that will help
2008-10-09T00:01:00.000Z	Frijolie	MrKennie	D'oh! Nope still getting same error
2008-10-09T00:01:00.000Z	MrKennie	Frijolie	what is it you are trying to install?
2008-10-09T00:01:00.000Z	Frijolie		drip
2008-10-09T00:02:00.000Z	Frijolie	MrKennie	drip 0.9. A DVD ripper
2008-10-09T00:02:00.000Z	MrKennie	Frijolie	dvdrip?
2008-10-09T00:02:00.000Z	Frijolie	MrKennie	no, not dvd::rip
2008-10-09T00:02:00.000Z	MrKennie	Frijolie	ok, just making sure :)
2008-10-09T00:02:00.000Z	MrKennie	Frijolie	I guess you need to find out from the documentation what it requires to build and then you will need to find the -dev packages.
2008-10-09T00:03:00.000Z	Frijolie	MrKennie	it's looking for gnomeConfig.sh in /usr/local/lib. Never heard of that file..I'll check the docs again
2008-10-09T00:04:00.000Z	MrKennie	Frijolie	look at ./configure --help too
2008-10-09T00:05:00.000Z	Frijolie		well they have an option in there "./configure --without-pic", which I'm using, but still get the error
2008-10-09T00:05:00.000Z	Frijolie		MrKennie:
2008-10-09T00:06:00.000Z	MrKennie	Frijolie	drip looks a bit dead to me, last package ubuntu had was in gutsy.
2008-10-09T00:07:00.000Z	Frijolie	MrKennie	you've had experience with dvd::rip?
2008-10-09T00:08:00.000Z	MrKennie	Frijolie	yes, it's not bad. There are some good guides on using it.
2008-10-09T00:11:00.000Z	Frijolie	MrKennie	alright, maybe I'll just give that a try I guess "dvd::rip"
