2007-02-28T11:16:00.000Z	suppaman		hi, I've got a friend with a problem
2007-02-28T11:16:00.000Z	ikonia_	suppaman	just ask the question
2007-02-28T11:17:00.000Z	ikonia_	suppaman	just tell him to install grub
2007-02-28T11:17:00.000Z	suppaman	ikonia_	it fails
2007-02-28T11:17:00.000Z	ikonia_	suppaman	at this level you should not be trying to tell him stuff you don't understand
2007-02-28T11:17:00.000Z	ikonia_	suppaman	it fails if you install it manually
2007-02-28T11:18:00.000Z	suppaman	ikonia_	why do you think I don't understand these things ?
2007-02-28T11:18:00.000Z	ikonia_	suppaman	because you can't work out what his root partition is
2007-02-28T11:18:00.000Z	suppaman	ikonia_	suprise me, how'd you do it ?
2007-02-28T11:18:00.000Z	ikonia_	suppaman	do what ?
2007-02-28T11:19:00.000Z	ikonia_	suppaman	fdisk -l $device
2007-02-28T11:19:00.000Z	ikonia_	suppaman	well you work it out if its an ide or a scsi or sata disk, and how many disks he has
2007-02-28T11:20:00.000Z	ikonia_	suppaman	there you go then
2007-02-28T11:20:00.000Z	ikonia_	suppaman	doesn't sound like you'd understand it anyway
2007-02-28T11:21:00.000Z	ikonia_	suppaman	then get on with fixing it then
2007-02-28T11:22:00.000Z	ikonia_	suppaman	if he got output from greping for sd - then you know it returned a value - which means there is a disk called sd$
2007-02-28T11:22:00.000Z	ikonia_	suppaman	a man of your skills should be able to work that out
2007-02-28T11:22:00.000Z	ikonia_	suppaman	worked what ?
2007-02-28T11:24:00.000Z	ikonia_	suppaman	well you can work it out
2007-02-28T11:24:00.000Z	ikonia_	suppaman	you can now that you've been told the answer
2007-02-28T11:27:00.000Z	ikonia_	suppaman	again you show your skill
2007-02-28T11:27:00.000Z	suppaman	ikonia_	that's why I answered to him
2007-02-28T11:29:00.000Z	suppaman	ikonia_	from my high skillness I can say he was using * to avoid writing the filename but only on irc
2007-02-28T11:29:00.000Z	ikonia_	suppaman	fair enough
