2007-03-01T07:37:00.000Z	mykk		hey i am installing ubuntu and i am checking cd integrity, it says it will take some time, i have been waiting here for 15 mins now and nothing has happened... is that right?
2007-03-01T07:38:00.000Z	ubm	mykk	your cd is fine man you can skip that shit ;)
2007-03-01T07:38:00.000Z	mykk	ubm	i'll try installing :)
2007-03-01T07:42:00.000Z	ubm	mykk	what hardware are you installing on? notebook or desktop?
2007-03-01T07:43:00.000Z	ubm	mykk	as in does the progress bar make it half way and then freeze?
2007-03-01T07:44:00.000Z	ubm	mykk	do you have anything else installed on the drive
2007-03-01T07:45:00.000Z	ubm	mykk	are you using the live cd for edgy eft?
2007-03-01T07:46:00.000Z	ubm	mykk	so just to make sure you have the latest build ubuntu 6.10 edgy eft?
2007-03-01T07:48:00.000Z	ubm	mykk	try selecting the first option in boot
2007-03-01T07:50:00.000Z	ubm	mykk	you need to start ubuntu install but try using the F option for screen do you see it? i think its F3 or F2 not sure right now
2007-03-01T07:50:00.000Z	ubm	mykk	i think it may be your screen resolution that is preventing you from booting into gnome
2007-03-01T07:51:00.000Z	mykk	ubm	it was set to 1920 x odd
2007-03-01T07:51:00.000Z	ubm	mykk	did you get into F4 and pass the argument in boot?
2007-03-01T07:52:00.000Z	mykk	ubm	- got an error  - /bin/sh can't access
2007-03-01T07:53:00.000Z	ubm	mykk	set the resolution to 800x600 for now
2007-03-01T07:54:00.000Z	ubm	mykk	take IndyGunFreak's advice try the alternate install cd if the setting the screen resolution 800x600 dosnt work. but i think its the VGA settings that are hosing up the system
2007-03-01T07:55:00.000Z	ubm	mykk	you could do what the rest of us do and smash your hands into the keyboard, bang your head against the monitor a few times... its worked for me...
2007-03-01T07:58:00.000Z	ubm	mykk	dont give up 5 minutes before the miracle happens :)
2007-03-01T08:02:00.000Z	ubm	mykk	did you find the alternate cd?
2007-03-01T08:03:00.000Z	ubm	mykk	http://ubuntu-releases.cs.umn.edu/edgy/ubuntu-6.10-alternate-i386.iso
2007-03-01T08:06:00.000Z	ubm	mykk	not you someone else
2007-03-01T08:07:00.000Z	ubm	mykk	sometimes people come in here and demand solutions to common issues when they dont get a reply in 2ms they go berserk.
2007-03-01T08:08:00.000Z	ubm	mykk	the reward with linux is when you help others that's how this whole thing started :)
2007-03-01T08:49:00.000Z	ubm	mykk	hows it comming along with the install?
