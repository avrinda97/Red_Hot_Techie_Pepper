2008-02-22T05:35:00.000Z	amenado		aeleon-> your server is behind your client? am kind lost on your description
2008-02-22T05:37:00.000Z	amenado		edward_-> it is a tuff one, there are tutorials you can find via google..
2008-02-22T05:37:00.000Z	aeleon	amenado	and when I try to look at my router's settings from my client, i can see it clearly.
2008-02-22T05:39:00.000Z	aeleon	amenado	^
2008-02-22T05:39:00.000Z	amenado	aeleon	your openvpn tunnenl is between which and which?
2008-02-22T05:40:00.000Z	aeleon	amenado	uhh? it's between an xp client here in the UK and an ubuntu server which is one of four behind a router. the other three are my family's pcs.
2008-02-22T05:43:00.000Z	aeleon	amenado	So I 192.168.1.1'd in my browser, and it got me into my router's settings at home, so I figured I could open ports. but, like I said, when I use, say, utorrent's port checker, it says they'r closed.
2008-02-22T05:44:00.000Z	aeleon	amenado	forward ports.
2008-02-22T05:45:00.000Z	aeleon	amenado	I'm sitting on my client with access to my server and i want to forward ports.
2008-02-22T05:46:00.000Z	aeleon	amenado	I want to be able to stream music.
2008-02-22T05:46:00.000Z	aeleon	amenado	and I don't want to use the port my server's listening on.
2008-02-22T05:46:00.000Z	aeleon	amenado	what? i want it streamable online.
2008-02-22T05:48:00.000Z	aeleon	amenado	ehh, yes and no. i want to run a shoutcast from my client while VPN'd to my server.
2008-02-22T05:49:00.000Z	aeleon	amenado	well, like i said, when i told my router to forward the port and then checked from my client to see it was open, it said it was closed.
2008-02-22T05:49:00.000Z	aeleon	amenado	because all my music's on my client.
2008-02-22T05:49:00.000Z	amenado	aeleon	certainly those can be transferred over to your ubuntu server right?
2008-02-22T05:50:00.000Z	aeleon	amenado	no, to be honest. there's too much of it.
2008-02-22T05:53:00.000Z	aeleon	amenado	why can i log into it successfully, then? and why does my server's ip come up when I look up my external ip?
2008-02-22T05:54:00.000Z	aeleon	amenado	it sees my one at home. it has to, because i'm at school.
2008-02-22T05:54:00.000Z	aeleon	amenado	no. when my vpn is on, all my traffic routes through my vpn.
2008-02-22T05:54:00.000Z	amenado	aeleon	thats what i want to establish
2008-02-22T05:55:00.000Z	aeleon	amenado	sorry if I didn't say that earlier.
2008-02-22T05:55:00.000Z	amenado	aeleon	i have to leave for a few, need to pick up stuff, be back in 20 mins
2008-02-22T05:55:00.000Z	aeleon	amenado	aight, thanks.
