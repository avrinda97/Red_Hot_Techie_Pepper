2007-12-18T14:19:00.000Z	timandtom		Is there a SIMPLE way to completely hide a folder/access it again?
2007-12-18T14:20:00.000Z	harm	timandtom	 rm -rf ?
2007-12-18T14:20:00.000Z	timandtom	harm	Eh?
2007-12-18T14:21:00.000Z	timandtom	harm	Like, in Windows, you can right click a folder, go to properties, and set it as hidden. Whats the linux equivalent? And then how do I open it when hidden
2007-12-18T14:21:00.000Z	harm	timandtom	well just rename it and put a . infront of the name
2007-12-18T14:23:00.000Z	harm	timandtom	well i type in where i want to go.. but the other way of doing that is by pressing CTRL+H which toggles SHOW HIDDEN folder on and off
2007-12-18T14:24:00.000Z	timandtom	harm	Ah, ok. Is there a way to NOT have it show up at the press of a button?
2007-12-18T14:24:00.000Z	harm	timandtom	nautilis is just the looking around the computer program
2007-12-18T14:24:00.000Z	harm	timandtom	with all the folders
2007-12-18T14:24:00.000Z	harm	timandtom	well what are we trying to hide here source code or porn?
2007-12-18T14:25:00.000Z	timandtom	harm	Well, it aint source code.
2007-12-18T14:26:00.000Z	harm	timandtom	fair enough, well what u could do is make a PORN partition which you could manually mount everytime u needs it?
2007-12-18T14:28:00.000Z	timandtom	harm	Erm, I'd rather not do anything complicated I'll screw up. Like I said, this is just a quick fix to keep stuff from prying eyes while I'm not looking. Something easy to access, just not falls-open easy
2007-12-18T14:29:00.000Z	harm	timandtom	ok here is an idea.. just call it .system
2007-12-18T14:30:00.000Z	harm	timandtom	look in ur homefolder with ctrl+h how many folders there are called gnome something
2007-12-18T14:32:00.000Z	harm	timandtom	look u shouldnt worry about porn anyway.. who really gives a dang about it these days
2007-12-18T14:33:00.000Z	timandtom	harm	I'm young enough to still live with my parents and younger bro, old enough too look at the stuff LEGALLY. You tell me :P
2007-12-18T14:33:00.000Z	harm	timandtom	dude iam 19 and i have a girlfriend and 10GB of pr0n
2007-12-18T14:34:00.000Z	timandtom	harm	But do ya live with your parents and lend your 13 y/o bro your laptop?
2007-12-18T14:34:00.000Z	harm	timandtom	just dont bluntly put it on the desktop calling it XXX cuz it wouldnt b cool for ur lil bro
2007-12-18T14:34:00.000Z	harm	timandtom	urm well i suppose u could just make a new linux user called pron :P which would give 0 access to other users but it would be quite some trouble transfering data
2007-12-18T14:35:00.000Z	timandtom	harm	Haha, nah, i'll just put it in the system files and hide it :P
2007-12-18T14:35:00.000Z	harm	timandtom	thats always a good way to go
2007-12-18T14:36:00.000Z	timandtom	harm	Durrr, YOU suggested it
