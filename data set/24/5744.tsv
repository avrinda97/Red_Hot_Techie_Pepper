2011-01-23T19:44:00.000Z	SAM__		thats correct i am unable to use apache as a result
2011-01-23T19:45:00.000Z	SAM__		webmin reports apache is installed and running however it is not
2011-01-23T19:45:00.000Z	ikonia	SAM__	webmin is unsupported here
2011-01-23T19:45:00.000Z	ikonia	SAM__	if you are using webmin to configure your ubuntu machine we cannot support you
2011-01-23T19:45:00.000Z	ikonia	SAM__	you just said you are using webmin
2011-01-23T19:46:00.000Z	ikonia	SAM__	ok - so that will break your configs
2011-01-23T19:48:00.000Z	ikonia	SAM__	can't really help now that webmin is messing with your configs
2011-01-23T19:48:00.000Z	ikonia	SAM__	too late
2011-01-23T19:49:00.000Z	ikonia	SAM__	read the PM ubottu sent you about webmin
2011-01-23T19:50:00.000Z	ikonia	SAM__	so it may have created MORE problems
2011-01-23T19:58:00.000Z	ikonia	SAM__	no they didn't
2011-01-23T19:59:00.000Z	ikonia	SAM__	I told you webmin is not supported and can cause problems to your machine which makes it unsupportable
2011-01-23T19:59:00.000Z	ikonia	SAM__	I didn't say it caused THIS problem, I said it's made your machine unsupportable
2011-01-23T20:01:00.000Z	ikonia	SAM__	I would re-install personally as you don't know what webmin has done
2011-01-23T20:01:00.000Z	ikonia	SAM__	there is no downgrade option
2011-01-23T20:18:00.000Z	ikonia	SAM__	11.04 is not supported here, please take it to #ubuntu+1
