2007-08-24T13:33:00.000Z	mastroDani		hi all.. i've installed ubuntu feisty on a friend's computer. then: Administrator->Share folders, installed samba and nfs.. then added a new smb share: all the home with write access... now.. when i try to open the share from a network computer (with windows xp) it ask for a password. and it doesn't accept my ubuntu user/password.. ? what i'm doing wrong? here the smb.conf created by the graphical tool: http://pastebin.
2007-08-24T13:33:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	mastroDani	you need to enable guest browsing for samba.
2007-08-24T13:34:00.000Z	mastroDani	fyrestrtr	and if i don't want guest browsing but want a new user? what i am supposed to do? (and how i enable the guest user anyway?)
2007-08-24T13:36:00.000Z	mastroDani	fyrestrtr	in the smb.conf i read at line 114 - 115 something that i think is supposed to sync the ubuntu user with the samba user

2007-08-24T13:37:00.000Z	mastroDani	fyrestrtr	don't give me a gentoo wiki.... this is supposed to work "out of the box" by the graphical interface.. if it don't.. i would like to understand why
2007-08-24T13:39:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	mastroDani	okay; well the reason it is not working is beacause the user you are passing to samba from Windows is not known to Samba. This is not your ubuntu user; but a user in Samba which are defined on a per-share level (or globally, depending on how you configured Samba). The Gentoo wiki has a great (one of the best) sections on confuring Samba. To find out what is going on, read it. If you don't want to -- then wait for someone els
2007-08-24T13:40:00.000Z	mastroDani	fyrestrtr	k.. tnx.. only one question.. read line 114 and 115 at http://pastebin.com/m74d8c9f8 and the comment above.. don't you think this are supposed to "link" in some way the ubuntu users with the samba users?
2007-08-24T13:42:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	mastroDani	you really need to read the wiki.
2007-08-24T13:43:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	mastroDani	as you have not configured it correctly :)
2007-08-24T13:44:00.000Z	mastroDani	fyrestrtr	i just followed the graphical interface.. i didn't writed a single line.. if something is not well configured is not my fault.. is probably a bug with feisty
2007-08-24T13:44:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	mastroDani	I *highly* doubt this is a bug in feisty.
2007-08-24T13:44:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	mastroDani	but, feel free to add it to launchpad if you feel so adamantly about it :)
2007-08-24T13:46:00.000Z	mastroDani	fyrestrtr	this is my procedure... fresh install... 1) Administrator -> Share Folders. 2) Accept to install Samba and NFS as requested 3) added a new share
2007-08-24T13:46:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	mastroDani	as I said; feel free to post it as a bug.
2007-08-24T13:49:00.000Z	mastroDani	fyrestrtr	ok.. i figured out the meaning of line 114 and 115 (with "some help :P" of #samba) they are there to update the unix password if i change the samba password... so it seems i have to create the samba user first... now... why feisty doesn't create it automatically? it is a bug? it was something wrong with my personal installation?
2007-08-24T13:50:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	mastroDani	I do not know what fiesty does; as I have never used the graphical wizard.
2007-08-24T13:52:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	mastroDani	however; to fix your problem; you need to either enable guest browsing; or add users to samba.
2007-08-24T13:53:00.000Z	mastroDani	fyrestrtr	yup.. i got it.. :) i'm new to samba but not new to linux.. :) i'm putting my mind in a noob user in front of this..
2007-08-24T13:55:00.000Z	mastroDani	fyrestrtr	i know i to solve my problem now.. i'm telling you there's something wrong there :) and you need to fix it if you want it to be REALLY easy :)
2007-08-24T13:56:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	mastroDani	of course by 'you' you mean the people that made that tool (as I didn't) :)
2007-08-24T13:57:00.000Z	mastroDani	fyrestrtr	i mean.. somebody in this chat know where to speak of this.. i dont.. may be the development channel? #ubuntu-dev ?
2007-08-24T13:57:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	mastroDani	first step would be to post a bug; then see who it is assigned to; and follow up from there.
2007-08-24T13:59:00.000Z	mastroDani	fyrestrtr	i think i will start from #ubuntu-dev
