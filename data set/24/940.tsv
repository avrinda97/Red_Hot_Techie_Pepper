2011-07-20T05:25:00.000Z	dr_willis		i will say that unity has gotten better in  the alpha.. but still has issues...
2011-07-20T05:25:00.000Z	KM0201	dr_willis	unity drove me to lubuntu
2011-07-25T05:21:00.000Z	KM0201	dr_willis	i thinkk thats a dumb move, software center sucks... i installed synaptic on 11.10, and it worked fine
2011-07-25T05:21:00.000Z	dr_willis	KM0201	 i never said it dident work.. its not installed by default..
2011-07-25T05:21:00.000Z	KM0201	dr_willis	oh i know, wasn't suggesting you did.
2011-09-24T22:48:00.000Z	KM0201	dr_willis	you used to be able to browse it as a guest.... no longer
2011-09-25T01:11:00.000Z	KM0201	dr_willis	20hrs?  i'd jsut be getting my ssecond wind at 20hrs.
2011-09-25T01:11:00.000Z	dr_willis	KM0201	 i bet you are not a grandparent either. :P
2011-09-25T01:11:00.000Z	KM0201	dr_willis	that's affirmative.
2011-10-04T01:58:00.000Z	dr_willis	KM0201	 You could always use the minimal cd, and install lubuntu-desktop on top of it.
2011-10-04T01:59:00.000Z	KM0201	dr_willis	to much hassle, i just wann atry it in vbox.
2011-10-04T01:59:00.000Z	dr_willis	KM0201	 lubuntu is often behind in releaseing the spefici lubuntu isos
2011-10-04T02:00:00.000Z	KM0201	dr_willis	i figured.. no big deal... i'm pretty happy w/ 11.10
2011-10-04T02:05:00.000Z	KM0201	dr_willis	looks like lubuntu is still on beta 2.. so yeah, they are lagging a bit, but i'll try the live cd in vbox
2011-12-03T10:50:00.000Z	KM0201	dr_willis	3d.. i don't think so.
2012-03-05T13:05:00.000Z	KM0201	dr_willis	does alacarte still work w/ unity?
2012-03-09T11:53:00.000Z	KM0201	dr_willis	that seems to be the issue, he can't download it, and he somehow thinks this is a linux issue.
2012-04-24T09:21:00.000Z	KM0201	dr_willis	i hope so
2012-05-01T10:52:00.000Z	KM0201	dr_willis	there you go.. :)
2012-05-18T13:54:00.000Z	KM0201	dr_willis	lol "his boy, elroy"
2012-05-22T09:41:00.000Z	KM0201	dr_willis	same
2012-05-22T09:54:00.000Z	KM0201	dr_willis	thats a good point
2012-09-02T16:15:00.000Z	KM0201	dr_willis	ubuntu-one , forwards to ubuntuone   if i had to guess, he's not identified... cuz i didn't get an invite and i got to both no problem
