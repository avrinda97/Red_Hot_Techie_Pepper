2007-10-23T20:41:00.000Z	thedrummer	animerunt	yes

2007-10-23T20:41:00.000Z	thedrummer	animerunt	with nvidia-config utility
2007-10-23T20:42:00.000Z	animerunt		ok, I've been playing with that myself, if you open that back up and uncheck the Xinerama box it will work
2007-10-23T20:43:00.000Z	animerunt	thedrummer	did you catch that?
2007-10-23T20:43:00.000Z	thedrummer	animerunt	y
2007-10-23T20:43:00.000Z	thedrummer	animerunt	xinerama wotking
2007-10-23T20:44:00.000Z	animerunt	thedrummer	xinerama is working?
2007-10-23T20:44:00.000Z	thedrummer	animerunt	yes
2007-10-23T20:44:00.000Z	animerunt	thedrummer	ok compiz will not work if that is enabled
2007-10-23T20:45:00.000Z	thedrummer	animerunt	well , it's strange becouse beryl worked with xinerama on 7.04 :|
2007-10-23T20:45:00.000Z	thedrummer	animerunt	compiz worked on 7.04 too ^_^
2007-10-23T20:46:00.000Z	animerunt	thedrummer	what is beryl? this is my first ubuntu flavor I've used
2007-10-23T20:46:00.000Z	thedrummer	animerunt	desktop effect manager
2007-10-23T20:48:00.000Z	animerunt	thedrummer	ah ok, well from my findings the compiz bundled with 7.10 will not work with xinerama enabled
2007-10-23T20:48:00.000Z	animerunt	thedrummer	that is all I know about the subject
2007-10-23T20:49:00.000Z	animerunt	thedrummer	you can still have 2 monitors with compiz but you will not be able to move windows from one monitor to the other
2007-10-23T20:50:00.000Z	animerunt	thedrummer	I hope I was a little help
2007-10-23T20:50:00.000Z	thedrummer	animerunt	ty , but i remember i had everything workin perfectly on 7.04
2007-10-23T20:51:00.000Z	animerunt	thedrummer	ok, well if you figure anything out message me if you don't mind at animeruntjunk@gmail.com
