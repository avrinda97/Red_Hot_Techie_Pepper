2010-03-02T02:13:00.000Z	ikonia	CRACKBOY	well, if you come back with your running ubuntu machine, we can walk you through updating your sources
2010-03-02T02:14:00.000Z	ikonia	CRACKBOY	really, I thought you where running the backtrack livecd ?
2010-03-02T02:15:00.000Z	ikonia	CRACKBOY	if you go to system -> administration -> synaptic, when that application opens it will update your sources info to current
2010-03-02T02:16:00.000Z	ikonia	CRACKBOY	why ?
2010-03-02T02:16:00.000Z	ikonia	CRACKBOY	that will be the latest version in the ubuntu 8.10 repo
2010-03-02T02:17:00.000Z	ikonia	CRACKBOY	don't build from source unless you %100 know what you're doing and how to manage custom packages/application
2010-03-02T02:17:00.000Z	ikonia	CRACKBOY	you're using an old version of ubuntu
2010-03-02T02:17:00.000Z	ikonia	CRACKBOY	8.10 is October 2008 release
2010-03-02T02:21:00.000Z	ikonia	CRACKBOY	ou're not allowed to login as root on ubuntu
2010-03-02T02:22:00.000Z	ikonia	CRACKBOY	yes, your usr account
2010-03-02T02:23:00.000Z	ikonia	CRACKBOY	also look at sudo -i
2010-03-02T02:23:00.000Z	ikonia	CRACKBOY	if you have to ask - you shouldn't as it's dangerous
2010-03-02T02:25:00.000Z	CRACKBOY	ikonia	how old are you ?
2010-03-02T02:25:00.000Z	ikonia	CRACKBOY	what does that matter ?
