2010-06-05T03:28:00.000Z	orangeglo		im having some trouble opening a .bin, can anyone help me??
2010-06-05T03:28:00.000Z	Appl6	orangeglo	Usually .bin is executable.  If you trust where you downloaded it from, try ./filename.bin from a terminal.
2010-06-05T03:49:00.000Z	Appl6	orangeglo	Where did you download this program?
2010-06-05T03:50:00.000Z	orangeglo	Appl6	off of the octoshape website
2010-06-05T03:50:00.000Z	Appl6	orangeglo	I meant where did you put it in your filesystem.
2010-06-05T03:50:00.000Z	orangeglo	Appl6	i put it in downloads, but i dont see the application in my downloads, only the .bin
2010-06-05T03:51:00.000Z	Appl6	orangeglo	Did you try the instructions here: http://www.octoshape.com/?page=get_octo/get_octo  ?
2010-06-05T03:55:00.000Z	orangeglo	Appl6	following the directions its telling me that the files doesnt exist :\ even though i just downloaded the file and unpacked it...
2010-06-05T03:56:00.000Z	Appl6	orangeglo	More specific, please.  How far in the instructions did you get?  What is the exact error message?
2010-06-05T03:56:00.000Z	orangeglo	Appl6	i extracted the .bin, and when it finished it gave me this : Go to octoshape and execute ./OctoshapeClient -url:octoshape:BROADCASTER.channel
2010-06-05T03:57:00.000Z	Appl6	orangeglo	Pastebin the results of "pwd" and "ls" please.
2010-06-05T03:59:00.000Z	Appl6	orangeglo	You can't paste a bunch of stuff to the channel.  Use http://paste.ubuntu.com
2010-06-05T04:01:00.000Z	Appl6	orangeglo	I don't understand your question.  The installation instructions give you a specific command to run; why are you trying to run some other command?
2010-06-05T04:01:00.000Z	orangeglo	Appl6	im just trying to do what the command told me to. it told me to execute the given command to the octoshape file. how do i do that??
2010-06-05T04:02:00.000Z	Appl6	orangeglo	You have to give us specific error messages.
2010-06-05T04:05:00.000Z	Appl6	orangeglo	Please "ls -l" and use http://paste.ubuntu.com for the output.
2010-06-05T04:07:00.000Z	Appl6	orangeglo	The file isn't in that directory.  Try "cd octoshape" and "ls -l" again.
2010-06-05T04:09:00.000Z	orangeglo	Appl6	http://paste.ubuntu.com/444839/
2010-06-05T04:09:00.000Z	Appl6	orangeglo	OK.  Now try the command you were trying to run before.
2010-06-05T04:09:00.000Z	orangeglo	Appl6	i just did, and there was no input
2010-06-05T04:09:00.000Z	orangeglo	Appl6	sorry output
2010-06-05T04:10:00.000Z	Appl6	orangeglo	Be specific.  Was there an error?  What did it say?  What did you expect to happen?  What command did you enter?
2010-06-05T04:10:00.000Z	orangeglo	Appl6	i typed in the exact directions, but there was nothing. no output.
