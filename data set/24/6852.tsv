2005-06-30T15:39:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Wilow	no
2005-06-30T15:24:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Wilow	fro amarok I suggest you install amarok-xine and change the engine for amarok to xine
2005-06-30T15:26:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Wilow	have you installed mplayer??
2005-06-30T15:40:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Wilow	that command works perfectly here: try copy-pasting it to a terminal
2005-06-30T15:40:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Wilow	in xmms prefs, change the output plugin to esound
2005-06-30T15:44:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Wilow	you can, but I strongly suggest you get the Ubuntu mplayer as Seveas said
2005-06-30T15:45:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Wilow	did you do a ` sudo apt-get update ` with your new sources.list in place?
2005-06-30T15:46:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Wilow	no errors on the update?
2005-06-30T15:48:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Wilow	that deb will get you a whole set of windows codecs, which should allow you to play most formats
2005-06-30T15:49:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Wilow	you should have a deb in that directory then
2005-06-30T15:51:00.000Z	Wilow	thoreauputic	ready
2005-06-30T15:52:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Wilow	have you tried installing mpayer again? BTW I suggest trying totem-xine instead
2005-06-30T15:53:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Wilow	I suggest you try ` sudo apt-get install totem-xine ` (don't worry if it wants to uninstall ubuntu-desktop and totem-gstreamer)
2005-06-30T16:06:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Wilow	I assume by your silence that you have sorted out your problems?
