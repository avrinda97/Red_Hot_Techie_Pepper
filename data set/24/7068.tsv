2005-05-01T08:06:00.000Z	Super_Cat_Frog		hi - ive just run bastille 2.something, but i would like to try 3 (its not in any repository i can find) so i installed the 'source' (its a script and the installer cp's or ln's, not sure. anyway, my problem is i cant execute bastille - it just give me --help like im giving invalid options when i do bastille or bastille --os DB3.0 - any idea's?
2005-05-01T08:08:00.000Z	Super_Cat_Frog		ekaitza-  you could put /etc and/or /home on cd. alternatively, slax has a system that saves your 'profile' on the internet and you pass something like profile=myprofile as a boot option, hopefully that will become popular with live cd's and we'l see it on more distro's
2005-05-01T08:09:00.000Z	Super_Cat_Frog		ekaitza - google for slax

2005-05-01T08:11:00.000Z	Super_Cat_Frog		seeker - that doesn't sound like any students i know (myself included)
2005-05-01T08:12:00.000Z	Ekaitza	Super_Cat_Frog	but is it a different linux??
2005-05-01T08:13:00.000Z	Super_Cat_Frog		ekaitza - slax is a different distro based on slackware (a do it yourself distro, really). i was just telling you about that feature
2005-05-01T08:13:00.000Z	Super_Cat_Frog		seeker - no i dont
2005-05-01T08:13:00.000Z	Super_Cat_Frog	blue_dolphin	- me
2005-05-01T08:13:00.000Z	Ekaitza		thanks endeed, I'm just having a look
2005-05-01T08:13:00.000Z	Super_Cat_Frog		seeker - maybe i misunderstood you, sorry bout that
2005-05-01T08:14:00.000Z	Super_Cat_Frog		ah - i didn't see where you said that
2005-05-01T08:14:00.000Z	Super_Cat_Frog		seeker - lol
2005-05-01T08:15:00.000Z	Super_Cat_Frog	blue_dolphin	- #mythtv-users is probably the best place for help
2005-05-01T08:16:00.000Z	Super_Cat_Frog	blue_dolphin	- just a quick suggestion, if you setup mythtv yesterday, then turned it off, turned it on today, your module's might not be loaded, try lsmod and check to see if your tv card modules are loaded
2005-05-01T08:18:00.000Z	Ekaitza	Super_Cat_Frog	that's just what I was looking for, but I forgot telling that I'm using Ubuntu because I've got an apple
2005-05-01T08:19:00.000Z	Super_Cat_Frog	blue_dolphin	- which module? bttv? saa7134?
2005-05-01T08:20:00.000Z	Super_Cat_Frog		then try lsmod | grep bttv
2005-05-01T08:20:00.000Z	Super_Cat_Frog		rmmod bttv ; modprobe bttv tuner=2
2005-05-01T08:21:00.000Z	Super_Cat_Frog	blue_dolphin	- did that work?
2005-05-01T08:21:00.000Z	Super_Cat_Frog	blue_dolphin	- have you tried ls /dev/vid*
2005-05-01T08:23:00.000Z	Super_Cat_Frog	blue_dolphin	- sorry, ive got no more idea's, you'l have to try #mythtv-users
2005-05-01T08:24:00.000Z	Super_Cat_Frog		s'ok
2005-05-01T08:24:00.000Z	Ekaitza	Super_Cat_Frog	you are the best ;)
