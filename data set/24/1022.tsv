2010-09-06T00:22:00.000Z	Deevz		alright this is not working
2010-09-06T00:23:00.000Z	Deevz		is there an option when installing ubuntu to do it without removing files in /home/{user}?
2010-09-06T00:24:00.000Z	Asigottech	Deevz	you mean on a re-install ?
2010-09-06T00:24:00.000Z	Deevz		yes
2010-09-06T00:24:00.000Z	Deevz		im kind of stuck right now
2010-09-06T00:24:00.000Z	Deevz		I upgraded my windows from vista to 7 so I put my important files on the ubuntu partition
2010-09-06T00:25:00.000Z	Deevz		but windows wont let me access the ubuntu part, even with special tools, and grub stopped working so only 7 boots
2010-09-06T00:25:00.000Z	Asigottech	Deevz	copy your files from Ubuntu to windows using the live disk then reinstall over that partion or make another partion to install on
2010-09-06T00:26:00.000Z	Deevz		i just read that, ubottu, didnt find anything that works for me
2010-09-06T00:26:00.000Z	Deevz		I get no boot menu, only grub command line interface
2010-09-06T00:27:00.000Z	Deevz		I cant no more
2010-09-06T00:27:00.000Z	Deevz		I just installed grub
2010-09-06T00:27:00.000Z	Deevz		and it has no meny
2010-09-06T00:27:00.000Z	Asigottech	Deevz	if you use the live disk you can mount both the old Ubuntu (and re-store grub) mount both windows and Ubuntu partitions and copy files over
2010-09-06T00:28:00.000Z	Deevz		I just did install it tho
2010-09-06T00:29:00.000Z	Deevz		its not gone because I can see the files from ubuntu live, but I cant read it
2010-09-06T00:29:00.000Z	Deevz		if there was a way to read/copy the files from my current ubuntu partition using the live cd, I would do it
2010-09-06T00:29:00.000Z	Deevz	ikonia	because it is encrypted I guess
2010-09-06T00:30:00.000Z	Asigottech	Deevz	mount the linux partion in live disk then just fdisk -l and it will tell you which part it is
2010-09-06T00:30:00.000Z	Deevz		I didnt
2010-09-06T00:30:00.000Z	Deevz		because I dont have permission to read it, ikonia
2010-09-06T00:31:00.000Z	Deevz		I didnt "mount" anything
2010-09-06T00:31:00.000Z	Deevz		I just explored thhe drive using the explorer tool, or whatever its called
2010-09-06T00:31:00.000Z	Asigottech	Deevz	if you can not see the partition and mount it (easiest way from places menu)  can not see it from fdisk or gparted and it is not encrypted then your pretty much fuc**d and should go drink some beer
