2009-04-04T18:25:00.000Z	ohletmeinnowjesu		 can someone help me with getting my bluetooth adapter on my vostro 1400 detected? All the help ive seen on the web points to installing windows and then installing the windows drivers to enable bluetooth support before it can be detected by linux. I dont have the $$ to buy a copy of xp just to enable something that I already paid for ...Ive enabled it in the bios but it doesnt show up on "bluez" or most of the cli comma
2009-04-04T18:26:00.000Z	daftykins	ohletmeinnowjesu	is there any kind of wireless switch which turns off wireless LAN and bluetooth at the same time?
2009-04-04T18:27:00.000Z	ohletmeinnowjesu	daftykins	ive "softwired" the wifi and bluetooth into a single switch command via the bios options
2009-04-04T18:28:00.000Z	ohletmeinnowjesu	daftykins	and i currentyly have that switch in the on position but only my wifi adapter is showing up in "network manager" while nothing is showing up in "bluez"
2009-04-04T18:31:00.000Z	daftykins	ohletmeinnowjesu	i always disconnect the battery and mains from a laptop so it has no power source to reset all internal features, see if that makes it reappear. obviously have your switch in the "on" position once you restore power
2009-04-04T18:33:00.000Z	ohletmeinnowjesu	daftykins	it never appeared in the first place... ive never used it...
2009-04-04T18:35:00.000Z	daftykins	ohletmeinnowjesu	it's possible you've got a laptop without bluetooth but the motherboard BIOS etc etc refers to it due to other laptop variations of the same model possessing it
2009-04-04T18:36:00.000Z	ohletmeinnowjesu	daftykins	ok, how do i know whether i do indeed have a bluetooth adapter on my laptop mobo?
2009-04-04T18:37:00.000Z	daftykins	ohletmeinnowjesu	 i used to remove the small covers underneath the laptop to locate a bluetooth module, but i wouldn't recommend that really. it sounds like you should've checked all hardware was working in the Windows install before nuking it? if it came with it... i guess you got it with ubuntu preloaded or something?
2009-04-04T18:38:00.000Z	ohletmeinnowjesu	daftykins	no i got it without windows
2009-04-04T18:39:00.000Z	ohletmeinnowjesu	daftykins	and when i looked at the invoice it says clearly BLuetooth
2009-04-04T18:39:00.000Z	ohletmeinnowjesu	daftykins	so
2009-04-04T18:40:00.000Z	ohletmeinnowjesu	daftykins	i think its a linux thing, not being compatible with the bluetooth adapter on this mobo
2009-04-04T18:40:00.000Z	daftykins	ohletmeinnowjesu	do you see it under 'lspci' or relevant terminal command?

2009-04-04T18:46:00.000Z	ohletmeinnowjesu	daftykins	i dont see anything related to bluetooth in the lscpi
2009-04-04T18:47:00.000Z	daftykins	ohletmeinnowjesu	 neither do i, how about "lsusb" ?
2009-04-04T18:49:00.000Z	ohletmeinnowjesu	daftykins	nope
2009-04-04T18:53:00.000Z	daftykins	ohletmeinnowjesu	if you got it with ubuntu i'd recommend pursuing support
2009-04-04T18:55:00.000Z	ohletmeinnowjesu	daftykins	no i got it with freeDOS
2009-04-04T19:01:00.000Z	ohletmeinnowjesu	daftykins	well?
2009-04-04T19:02:00.000Z	daftykins	ohletmeinnowjesu	i have no idea. i'd borrow a copy of Windows and diagnose it further that way - but if it's new you should request support from Dell
2009-04-04T19:02:00.000Z	ohletmeinnowjesu	daftykins	no i got it in 2007
2009-04-04T19:03:00.000Z	ohletmeinnowjesu	daftykins	besides theyd probably just tell me they never tested it : http://linux.dell.com/wiki/index.php/Tech/Wireless#Bluetooth
