2011-03-28T04:58:00.000Z	truepurple	xangua	I installed it, why would it install without anyone being given administrator privileges?
2011-03-28T04:59:00.000Z	truepurple	xangua	If I don't have administrator priviledges, no one does.
2011-03-28T05:38:00.000Z	xangua	truepurple	sudo apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree
2011-03-28T05:40:00.000Z	truepurple	xangua	Do I need a internet connection for this to work?
2011-03-28T05:41:00.000Z	xangua	truepurple	aaah, yes
2011-11-12T06:39:00.000Z	xangua	truepurple	with gnome-mplayer you can select manually the binary of the mplayer you compiled....or next time just stick to the packages provided by your repository
2011-11-12T06:39:00.000Z	truepurple	xangua	the package provided my my repository was inadequate
2011-11-12T06:40:00.000Z	truepurple	xangua	I did not understand the first half of what you said
2011-11-12T06:41:00.000Z	truepurple	xangua	 gnome-mplayer is a front end?
2011-11-12T06:42:00.000Z	xangua	truepurple	yes
2011-11-12T06:43:00.000Z	xangua	truepurple	but is not gmplayer i believe, anyway you can select the mplayer binaty with any fronted
2011-11-12T06:44:00.000Z	truepurple	xangua	you mean you can select which mplayer the smplayer is pointed to after the fac
2011-11-12T06:44:00.000Z	xangua	truepurple	on the preferences
2011-11-12T06:45:00.000Z	truepurple	xangua	is there a way to install smplayer without it triggering its own mplayer installation?
2012-06-07T23:08:00.000Z	xangua	truepurple	well looks like the problem is the ppa, try the one in ubuntu repository
2012-06-07T23:09:00.000Z	truepurple	xangua	how?
2012-06-07T23:10:00.000Z	xangua	truepurple	disable or purge the ppa
