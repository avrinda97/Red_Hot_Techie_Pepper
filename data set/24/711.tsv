2011-05-16T07:13:00.000Z	Cajun_Lan_Man		Hello all.  Does anyone happen to know a trick for getting wireless working on a dell Latitude d600? i've never had wireless problems with Ubuntu, so honestly i'm not sure what to do.
2011-05-16T07:13:00.000Z	Cajun_Lan_Man		I'm running 11.04
2011-05-16T07:14:00.000Z	bobweaver	Cajun_Lan_Man	are you on it roght now?
2011-05-16T07:15:00.000Z	bobweaver	Cajun_Lan_Man	please plug in the cat5 cable to the d600
2011-05-16T07:16:00.000Z	bobweaver	Cajun_Lan_Man	do a dmesg | grep b43 see any errors
2011-05-16T07:17:00.000Z	bobweaver	Cajun_Lan_Man	also check rfkill list all
2011-05-16T07:23:00.000Z	bobweaver	Cajun_Lan_Man	any errors on the dmesg | grep b43
2011-05-16T07:23:00.000Z	bobweaver	Cajun_Lan_Man	any errors on the dmesg | grep b43|/wl ?
2011-05-16T07:23:00.000Z	Cajun_Lan_Man	bobweaver	it's telling me ERROR: you must go to *weblink* and download the correct firmware.  I thought the "Additional Drivers" took care of that kind of thing.
2011-05-16T07:24:00.000Z	bobweaver	Cajun_Lan_Man	rfkill list all any thing blocked ?
2011-05-16T07:25:00.000Z	Cajun_Lan_Man	bobweaver	nothing is blocked
2011-05-16T07:25:00.000Z	bobweaver	Cajun_Lan_Man	you need to re-install the firmware-b43-installer
2011-05-16T07:27:00.000Z	bobweaver	Cajun_Lan_Man	see http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1748245&page=5     post #44
2011-05-16T07:42:00.000Z	Cajun_Lan_Man	bobweaver	Well I tried installing firmware-b43legacy-installer, but some subprocess installed postinstallation script returned error exit status 1.
2011-05-16T07:43:00.000Z	bobweaver	Cajun_Lan_Man	reboot try again
2011-05-16T07:43:00.000Z	Cajun_Lan_Man	bobweaver	looking at the details, it shows "Not supported card here (blah blah) Use b43 firmware. This is just for the b43legacy driver. Aborting.
2011-05-16T07:45:00.000Z	bobweaver	Cajun_Lan_Man	take your time and read it all (the link )
2011-05-16T07:58:00.000Z	Cajun_Lan_Man	bobweaver	meh, I seem to be going backwards.  Now the wireless option has vanished from the network indicator.
2011-05-16T07:59:00.000Z	bobweaver	Cajun_Lan_Man	is the dmesg error gone is rfkill list all     anything blocked
2011-05-16T08:02:00.000Z	Cajun_Lan_Man	bobweaver	the dmesg doesn't seem to do anything now.
2011-05-16T08:03:00.000Z	bobweaver	Cajun_Lan_Man	what about rfkill list all
2011-05-16T08:04:00.000Z	bobweaver	Cajun_Lan_Man	go back to the therad and post lsmod and dmesg
2011-05-16T08:05:00.000Z	Cajun_Lan_Man	bobweaver	Thanks for taking the time.
