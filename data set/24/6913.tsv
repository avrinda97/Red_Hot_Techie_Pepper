2005-09-25T14:57:00.000Z	TokenBad		anyone know?
2005-09-25T14:58:00.000Z	ompaul	TokenBad	where did you get that .deb from?
2005-09-25T14:59:00.000Z	ompaul	TokenBad	where did you get that .deb from? if it is not for you exact distribution then don't use it
2005-09-25T14:59:00.000Z	TokenBad	ompaul	got the deb file from http://packages.ubuntu.com/cgi-bin/download.pl?arch=i386&file=pool%2Funiverse%2Fe%2Felectricsheep%2Felectricsheep_2.6.2-1~hoary1_i386.deb&md5sum=c0b47404763b62b7b9f4cc681a64d316&arch=i386&type=main
2005-09-25T15:01:00.000Z	ompaul	TokenBad	do this, ls /usr/share/xscreensaver/config/electric* and see if you get a result
2005-09-25T15:02:00.000Z	ompaul	TokenBad	is there something there?
2005-09-25T15:03:00.000Z	TokenBad	ompaul	says no file or dir
2005-09-25T15:05:00.000Z	ompaul	TokenBad	so do this >>sudo touch /usr/share/xscreensaver/config/electricsheep.xml<< then try again - report it as a bug if that is the fix point that out :)
2005-09-25T15:08:00.000Z	TokenBad	ompaul	says same thing...
2005-09-25T15:08:00.000Z	ompaul	TokenBad	check if the file now exists - use the up arrow to go back the couple of commands to the >>ls ... << command
2005-09-25T15:10:00.000Z	ompaul	TokenBad	paste the whole output of the dpkg command to paste.ubuntulinux.nl
2005-09-25T15:13:00.000Z	TokenBad	ompaul	done
2005-09-25T15:14:00.000Z	ompaul	TokenBad	I have no further ideas, I was hoping for that to be the way
2005-09-25T15:14:00.000Z	ompaul	TokenBad	I would figure something else out
2005-11-27T11:49:00.000Z	ompaul	TokenBad	which version of ubuntu is it? what kind of modem is it?
2005-11-27T11:49:00.000Z	TokenBad	ompaul	he said it came in a hp computer
2006-05-06T09:58:00.000Z	ompaul	TokenBad	no, you do this
2006-05-06T09:58:00.000Z	ompaul	TokenBad	you identify the program that has them open and close it correctly, if you have a terminal involved you cd / to get away from the cd
2006-05-06T09:59:00.000Z	ompaul	TokenBad	in order to copy your nautilus opened a path to the CD you need to close that
2006-08-20T14:32:00.000Z	ompaul	TokenBad	there you go, there is no tcl for hoary, I have not run that version of ubuntu in about a year
2006-08-20T14:33:00.000Z	ompaul	TokenBad	you will have to install it from source, be aware that hoary is out of support come October I would get a later distro first
2006-08-20T14:34:00.000Z	TokenBad	ompaul	its for a friend...that was all the disk he had...and he is learning it while waiting on the dapper disk
2006-08-20T14:36:00.000Z	ompaul	TokenBad	I would see if it was in back-ports from breezy check you have the repos enabled from /etc/apt/sources.list
