2011-10-04T15:30:00.000Z	glebihan	arovij	do you have a deb-src line in your sources.list
2011-10-04T15:31:00.000Z	arovij	glebihan	: Honestly I was doing a little trial and error and Now there are a lot of deb-src entries
2011-10-04T15:31:00.000Z	glebihan	arovij	ok could you pastebin you sources.list file then so I can have a look ?
2011-10-04T15:33:00.000Z	arovij	glebihan	: pastebin.com/10eKKghj
2011-10-04T15:33:00.000Z	arovij	glebihan	: sorry there is a type
2011-10-04T15:37:00.000Z	glebihan	arovij	wow that's ugly... how did you get to such a mixture ?
2011-10-04T15:39:00.000Z	glebihan	arovij	and which version are you actually running ?
2011-10-04T15:41:00.000Z	glebihan	arovij	you didn't answer my question. Which version of ubuntu are you running ?
2011-10-04T15:41:00.000Z	glebihan	arovij	then why do you have edgy, gutsy and hardy repositories set up ???
2011-10-04T15:43:00.000Z	glebihan	arovij	it's always a bad idea to mix repositories from different versions
2011-10-04T15:44:00.000Z	glebihan	arovij	why are you trying to build firefox3 ?
2011-10-04T15:45:00.000Z	glebihan	arovij	your best bet would probably be to get back to a normal sources.list (with lucid entries) then download firefox4 source from mozilla's website and build from that
2011-10-05T09:42:00.000Z	arovij	glebihan	: ping.
2011-10-05T09:52:00.000Z	glebihan	arovij	first thing, there are no packages for hardy at all in that ppa
2011-10-05T09:54:00.000Z	arovij	glebihan	: sorry it's this one.. http://repogen.simplylinux.ch/
2011-10-05T09:56:00.000Z	glebihan	arovij	well I don't know exactly how this site works, but it doesn't really matter
2011-10-05T09:56:00.000Z	arovij	glebihan	: ok..
2011-10-05T09:56:00.000Z	glebihan	arovij	as I said there are no packages for hardy in the ppa you added, and there is no chance you'll ever get to build firefox 10 for it
2011-10-05T09:58:00.000Z	arovij	glebihan	: I can't build this on later versions of ubuntu.. I have to build with 6.06 ... what entries can I make?
2011-10-05T09:59:00.000Z	glebihan	arovij	nothing you can do. It simply won't work. And why adding a hardy repository on 6.06 ? Why do you need to build for that version
2011-10-05T10:00:00.000Z	arovij	glebihan	: I have to make some changes for firefox and later deploy it on some 100 odd machines.. Now these machines use very old version of linux. i have to replicate the same enviornment in my machine..
2011-10-05T10:03:00.000Z	glebihan	arovij	well 6.06 is way outdated... and not supported at all. The thing to do is either upgrade those machines or stick with old versions of firefox
2011-10-05T10:03:00.000Z	arovij	glebihan	: you are right. ok let me try putting some sense in my seniors.. Thanks for your time :)
2011-10-05T10:04:00.000Z	glebihan	arovij	you're welcome
