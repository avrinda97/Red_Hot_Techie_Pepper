2009-11-20T03:12:00.000Z	simplexio		9.10 is alot faster than 9.04.. but 8.04 was more mature as system, specialy when speaking sound
2009-11-20T03:13:00.000Z	simplexio		dist-upgrade suck when 9.04->9.10
2009-11-20T03:14:00.000Z	simplexio		offcoutse i had to rm .gnome oand so on but smooth
2009-11-20T03:15:00.000Z	simplexio		but fresh and clean install on 9.10 is much better thatn 9.04 in vbox system, no experince on native install lately
2009-11-20T03:17:00.000Z	simplexio		8.04 was better because it used alsa sound as default, pulseaudio starts to be ready nowdays..
2009-11-20T03:17:00.000Z	kostkon	simplexio	wrong. 8.04 had pulse also, just didn't send the alsa sound through pulse. that cause a lot of probs
2009-11-20T03:18:00.000Z	kostkon		caused*
2009-11-20T03:18:00.000Z	simplexio		i mean pulseaduio offer some nice options, but it isnt that solid as alsa, but its getting better and one way to get there is have it default in ubuntu
2009-11-20T03:18:00.000Z	kostkon	simplexio	but it's the default, already, since 8.04
2009-11-20T03:19:00.000Z	simplexio	kostkon	uhh. when it wasnt default, i was sure that it was 8.04
2009-11-20T03:19:00.000Z	kostkon	simplexio	and, the prob is that pulse is being blamed for everything
2009-11-20T03:20:00.000Z	kostkon	simplexio	there is a pulse-phobia when in the majority of cases the prob is with alsa or with the app
2009-11-20T03:20:00.000Z	simplexio	kostkon	my biggest problems have been allways puls, when it dies or something dosent support it from basic isntall
2009-11-20T03:20:00.000Z	kostkon	simplexio	and not with pulse per se
2009-11-20T03:21:00.000Z	simplexio		not that i dont like pulse, its been ready for experimental long time. maybe niot for major release like ubuntu. but that is price to pay for it get ready
2009-11-20T03:22:00.000Z	kostkon	simplexio	yeah, again i suppose it means the alsa driver is buggy. and if an app doesn't work with alsa, and thus not with pulse, but tries to access the device directly. again not pulse's fault.
2009-11-20T03:23:00.000Z	simplexio		little better pulse controller that shows features in english, not nerd for networks options and stuff. then it hit major time. + offcourse some easy release for windows to handle pulse streams easily would be killer app
2009-11-20T03:25:00.000Z	simplexio	kostkon	like i had 0 times problems with alsa, and pulse like 10 times on same hardware over little over two years... ofcourse source of problem cou√∂d be that pulse show alsa problem but anyway. i havent got anyproblems with pulse on 9.10
2009-11-20T03:25:00.000Z	kostkon	simplexio	no probs on 9.10. that's good then :)
2009-11-20T03:26:00.000Z	simplexio	kostkon	but i use 9.10 in vbox only.. and its faster than 9.04. like i said havent run linux in native desktop for few months.
2009-11-20T03:26:00.000Z	kostkon	simplexio	aha
2009-11-20T03:27:00.000Z	simplexio	kostkon	offcourse what i want currently isnt ubuntu mainstream. like latest geos lib + postgis + postgresql + pgadmin etc..
2009-11-20T03:27:00.000Z	kostkon	simplexio	:)
2009-11-20T03:28:00.000Z	simplexio	kostkon	but i still have 9.04 in my fileserver, no X, no sound, no problems. just soft raid + crypt etc.
