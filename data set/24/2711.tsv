2008-09-19T09:00:00.000Z	dmsuperman		Whenever I enable tv out my X session crashes. I've no idea what i'm looking for in Xorg.0.log, anybody mind pointing me in the right direction or helping me figure it out?
2008-09-19T09:01:00.000Z	DasEi	dmsuperman	: which graphics ?
2008-09-19T09:02:00.000Z	dmsuperman	DasEi	nvidia 7900 GS KO with 173.14 driver
2008-09-19T09:03:00.000Z	DasEi	dmsuperman	: nvidia driver installed ?
2008-09-19T09:04:00.000Z	dmsuperman	DasEi	Yeah, binaries
2008-09-19T09:04:00.000Z	dmsuperman	DasEi	The only error I can find in my syslog is bonobo-activatiion segfault but I'm not sure if that's even related or at the same time
2008-09-19T09:05:00.000Z	DasEi	dmsuperman	: took nvidia from source ?
2008-09-19T09:05:00.000Z	dmsuperman	DasEi	i said binaries from nvidia -_-
2008-09-19T09:06:00.000Z	dmsuperman	DasEi	I have this in my syslog: Sep 18 23:44:32 blitzkrieg gdm[6698]: WARNING: gdm_slave_xioerror_handler: Fatal X error - Restarting :0
2008-09-19T09:06:00.000Z	DasEi	dmsuperman	: in ati its that many cards nees it disabled until driver-packaccke from HP is installed, then u use the control-center came with the installer I think there is an nvidia-config, too , see !nvidia
2008-09-19T09:07:00.000Z	dmsuperman	DasEi	I know all that, I'm using nvidia-settings to manage my outputs. The problem is, when I enable my tv output X crashes
2008-09-19T09:08:00.000Z	DasEi	dmsuperman	don't know enough 'bout nvidia, wait for someone else
2009-01-18T23:56:00.000Z	DasEi	dmsuperman	: did you have ff open at install ?
2009-01-18T23:56:00.000Z	dmsuperman	DasEi	No
2009-01-18T23:58:00.000Z	dmsuperman	DasEi	I did that, but the plugin isn't listed in about:plugins
2009-01-18T23:58:00.000Z	DasEi	dmsuperman	:sudo apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree libflashsupport mozzpluger (with ff closed)
2009-01-18T23:59:00.000Z	dmsuperman	DasEi	libflashsupport has been obseleted or doesn't exit
2009-01-18T23:59:00.000Z	DasEi	dmsuperman	:speaking for hardy, are on ibex ?
2009-01-18T23:59:00.000Z	dmsuperman	DasEi	ibex
2009-01-19T00:00:00.000Z	dmsuperman	DasEi	Any ideas why that is?
2009-01-19T00:00:00.000Z	DasEi	dmsuperman	: you can manually install flash 10 beta (works fine for my 64 bit) , remove nonfreeplugin before (adobe-hp)
2009-01-19T00:04:00.000Z	dmsuperman	DasEi	Alrighty, got it installed,but the performance is terrible :(. You can literally see it refresh
2009-01-19T00:04:00.000Z	dmsuperman	DasEi	Occasionally it just lags
2009-01-19T00:09:00.000Z	DasEi	dmsuperman	mine does fine, I had to remove the onbord stuff first, then get tar.gz from adobe, compiled it an had a *.so file copied into ff's plugin folder, (couldn't believe before, too)
