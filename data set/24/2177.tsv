2009-07-19T10:55:00.000Z	tehbaut		how do I get to the partition manager?
2009-07-19T10:57:00.000Z	tehbaut		isn't that included by default?
2009-07-19T10:59:00.000Z	tehbaut		so why is 8.04 missing that top-right-corner "tray"?
2009-07-19T11:00:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tehbaut	,because it's a resonably new thing, also  Ubuntu's version isn't even part of upstream Gnome,   which is also why shut down and logout get removed from the system menu :(,  really it's only meant to be a user switcher
2009-07-19T11:00:00.000Z	tehbaut	sebsebseb	so the tray is part of 8.10 but not 8.04?
2009-07-19T11:01:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tehbaut	did you mean the log out and shutdown thing?
2009-07-19T11:01:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tehbaut	if you mean the applicaitons tray,  there should be something
2009-07-19T11:01:00.000Z	tehbaut	sebsebseb	uh all I can remember is that it had a network status and quick-connect for wifi
2009-07-19T11:01:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tehbaut	ok  we weren't talking about  the same thing,   the only thing we were talking about that was the same, is top right  corner of  the panel
2009-07-19T11:02:00.000Z	tehbaut	sebsebseb	so I'm looking for the "system tray" ...is that right?
2009-07-19T11:02:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tehbaut	yep, and not the other thing,  which I hope is missing still in 8.04 :)
2009-07-19T11:03:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tehbaut	you should be able to add stuff to the panel
2009-07-19T11:03:00.000Z	tehbaut	sebsebseb	so the notification icons were added with 8.10?
2009-07-19T11:03:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tehbaut	which notification icons?
2009-07-19T11:03:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tehbaut	8.10 is a good release
2009-07-19T11:03:00.000Z	tehbaut	sebsebseb	, I'm not seeing any notification area at all in 8.04
2009-07-19T11:04:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tehbaut	sadly 8.10 isn't LTS,  if you run the  panel resting command that can solve stuff
2009-07-19T11:04:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tehbaut	why?
2009-07-19T11:05:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tehbaut	run the command the bot gave, that should help
2009-07-19T11:08:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tehbaut	that's not off topic
2009-07-19T11:08:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tehbaut	there's some sort of command, but you can also boot up Windows again and shut it down properly
2009-07-19T11:08:00.000Z	tehbaut	sebsebseb	meant off topic from my latest topics :P
2009-07-19T11:09:00.000Z	tehbaut	sebsebseb	yes I just need to move a couple files to that part
2009-10-20T08:53:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tehbaut	recommended though, nope
