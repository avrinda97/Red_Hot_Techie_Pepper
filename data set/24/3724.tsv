2007-10-31T01:04:00.000Z	Hellsbovine		fsck problem, no idea how to fix.
2007-10-31T01:04:00.000Z	LiMaO	Hellsbovine	have you tried running fsck manually?
2007-10-31T01:03:00.000Z	Hellsbovine	LiMaO	Please read up, the question has been asked.
2007-10-31T01:05:00.000Z	Hellsbovine	LiMaO	when I try and do it (not even knowing if I am doing it correctly) it does something... but nothing of any benefit (talking 9 hours of just sitting there)
2007-10-31T01:05:00.000Z	Hellsbovine	LiMaO	I don't think I know how to do it "manually"
2007-10-31T01:05:00.000Z	LiMaO	Hellsbovine	you may have a problem with your drive.. but let me explain it to you
2007-10-31T01:05:00.000Z	LiMaO	Hellsbovine	just a second
2007-10-31T01:08:00.000Z	LiMaO	Hellsbovine	http://www.hmug.org/man/8/fsck.php
2007-10-31T01:09:00.000Z	Hellsbovine	LiMaO	you just sent me to a man page... one that I have bashed my brain against for quite some time. Thanks, but please, assume I have scoured the internet already.
2007-10-31T01:10:00.000Z	LiMaO	Hellsbovine	i sent you to a man page because you said you probably don't know how to do it manually. you should check what options would you need to use within fsck to have your problem fixed. if still fsck doesn't work correctly, probably you have a dead drive
2007-10-31T01:11:00.000Z	Hellsbovine	LiMaO	Or: the filesystem is mounted... or I need to be runlevel 1.. or....
2007-10-31T01:11:00.000Z	Hellsbovine	LiMaO	Thankyou anyways.
2007-10-31T01:11:00.000Z	LiMaO	Hellsbovine	use a livecd and do not run fsck on a mounted drive
2007-10-31T01:11:00.000Z	Hellsbovine	LiMaO	Tried.. failed.
2007-10-31T01:11:00.000Z	LiMaO	Hellsbovine	failed with what error?
2007-10-31T01:11:00.000Z	Hellsbovine	LiMaO	drive is readable
2007-10-31T01:12:00.000Z	LiMaO	Hellsbovine	readable? that's not an error
2007-10-31T01:12:00.000Z	Hellsbovine	LiMaO	I was giving you another piece of information, I can read stuff off the drive with a live cd.
2007-10-31T01:12:00.000Z	LiMaO	Hellsbovine	oh ok
2007-10-31T01:14:00.000Z	LiMaO	Hellsbovine	you probably have a dead drive then..
2007-10-31T01:15:00.000Z	Hellsbovine	LiMaO	I seriously doubt dead drive... I can read files off of it... >.>
2007-10-31T01:15:00.000Z	LiMaO	Hellsbovine	you may read files off it, but probably not files that are or could be stored on bad sectors of the drive
2007-10-31T01:22:00.000Z	LiMaO	Hellsbovine	to be on runlevel 1, run 'sudo /sbin/init 1'
2007-10-31T01:19:00.000Z	LiMaO	Hellsbovine	well, to have a drive unmounted, type 'sudo umount /dev/you-drive-here'
