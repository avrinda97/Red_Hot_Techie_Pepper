2005-09-18T06:18:00.000Z	carlos_		hello I need help
2005-09-18T06:18:00.000Z	carlos_		I'm trying to install the kernel sources to install a PCtel modem, I did sudo apt-get install linux-source-2.6.10 and that puts a *.bz2 with the kernel in /usr/src but that doesn't work for the setup of the modem, it keeps asking me for the sources
2005-09-18T06:19:00.000Z	carlos_		what more should I need to do?
2005-09-18T06:19:00.000Z	tga	carlos_	do you have a /usr/src/linux symlink pointing to the current sources?
2005-09-18T06:20:00.000Z	carlos_	tga	I think not, but how I check that?
2005-09-18T06:20:00.000Z	tga	carlos_	ls -al /usr/src
2005-09-18T06:24:00.000Z	carlos_	tga	what is a symlink?
2005-09-18T06:24:00.000Z	tga	carlos_	a symlink is like a file system shortcut.. it looks like a dir or file but it's just a link someplace else
2005-09-18T06:24:00.000Z	tga	carlos_	you create a symlink with `ln -s SOURCE DESTINATION`
2005-09-18T06:25:00.000Z	tga	carlos_	afaik /usr/src/linux should point to the current kernel sources
2005-09-18T06:25:00.000Z	tga	carlos_	also make sure you have the right sources.. you can see what kernel you're running with `uname -a`
2005-09-18T06:26:00.000Z	carlos_	tga	thank you man! and sorry, I'm just another newbie here :P
2005-09-18T06:27:00.000Z	tga	carlos_	no problem, I hope that fixes your problem
2005-09-18T06:32:00.000Z	carlos_	tga	man! the same problem, can you check my paste bin please: http://paste.ubuntulinux.nl/2128
2005-09-18T06:34:00.000Z	tga	carlos_	sudo ln -s /usr/src/linux-source-2.6.10.tar.bz2 /usr/src/linux
2005-09-18T06:34:00.000Z	tga	carlos_	as shown at the end of your paste, the script looks for the sources in /usr/src/linux
2005-09-18T06:36:00.000Z	carlos_	tga	ok, let me fix that, thx
2005-09-18T06:38:00.000Z	tga	carlos_	as Xorlev is saying, you have to extract your sources first
2005-09-18T06:40:00.000Z	carlos_	tga	I've extracted before and that doesn't work. thank you Xorlev
2005-09-18T06:40:00.000Z	tga	carlos_	http://paste.ubuntulinux.nl/2131
2005-09-18T06:42:00.000Z	carlos_	tga	yep, only for that drivers
2005-09-18T06:56:00.000Z	carlos_	tga	Xorlev, friends, I did it!!!, I mean... we did it!!, thank you guys, the headers were the solution ;)
2005-09-18T06:58:00.000Z	carlos_	tga	Xorlev, just a curiosity what is the difference between the sources I installed before and the headers?
2005-09-18T06:59:00.000Z	tga	carlos_	the headers don't contain the actual code, just the definition of the kernel functions
