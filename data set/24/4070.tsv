2007-07-20T08:20:00.000Z	ExiledSoldier	Pelo	for the root its 1,0 because its a seperate HDD does it matter?
2007-07-20T08:21:00.000Z	Pelo	ExiledSoldier	  windows won'T boot from the "second" hdd, so you need to remap it as the first one , hence the two lines,   then  the line to change the location to boot from
2007-07-20T08:21:00.000Z	Pelo	ExiledSoldier	 I've had this problem in the past

2007-07-20T08:37:00.000Z	Pelo	ExiledSoldier	don'T know if that matters but windows may indeed have an issue with being booted from a slive,    meet me in #grub it's a better place then here
