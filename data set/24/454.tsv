2011-08-23T15:37:00.000Z	JadedJacob		Hi, a friend of mine asked me to setup linux on their laptop, but I don't know where to begin.
2011-08-23T15:37:00.000Z	theadmin	JadedJacob	"where to begin"? Begin with downloading an ISO image and burning it.
2011-08-23T15:37:00.000Z	theadmin	JadedJacob	Ubuntu's fine for that
2011-08-23T15:37:00.000Z	theadmin	JadedJacob	Kubuntu gives ya more eyecandys
2011-08-23T15:38:00.000Z	theadmin	JadedJacob	You can save a flashdrive as well, using Grub to boot the ISO :D
2011-08-23T15:40:00.000Z	theadmin	JadedJacob	More
2011-08-23T15:41:00.000Z	theadmin	JadedJacob	If you need something lightweight you should really use Openbox or Xfce or something
2011-08-23T15:44:00.000Z	theadmin	JadedJacob	More than enough to run Ubuntu, do not worry
2011-08-23T15:44:00.000Z	theadmin	JadedJacob	It's not Windows 7 you know
2011-08-23T15:44:00.000Z	theadmin	JadedJacob	Then download the 32-bit Ubuntu version.
2011-08-23T15:45:00.000Z	theadmin	JadedJacob	I do agree... Is it at least an i686-compatible processor? If so we're fine
2011-08-23T15:47:00.000Z	theadmin	JadedJacob	Um, you do not need to worry there, it is
2012-02-09T15:24:00.000Z	theadmin	JadedJacob	That would be correct. But 10.04 will expire sooner or later. I suggest you try Xubuntu
2012-02-09T15:27:00.000Z	JadedJacob	theadmin	What do you mean expire? Can't you just keep applying security updates to it?
2012-02-09T15:27:00.000Z	theadmin	JadedJacob	Not forever. Every Ubuntu release has an expiration date, after which it's repositories will go offline
2012-02-09T15:27:00.000Z	theadmin	JadedJacob	LTS are supported longer, but still not forever
2012-02-09T15:28:00.000Z	theadmin	JadedJacob	Untrue. You can use classic gnome if you "apt-get install gnome-fallback"
2012-02-09T15:28:00.000Z	theadmin	JadedJacob	Or you can use gnome-shell
2012-02-09T15:28:00.000Z	theadmin	JadedJacob	You're free to choose
2012-02-09T18:23:00.000Z	theadmin	JadedJacob	ext4 has some new filesystem options (large fs support, extents, multiblock allocation etc), but most of the time ext3 and ext4 perform the same. ext3 has more compatibility though (older, better tested)... I use ext3 myself, can't complain heh
2012-02-09T18:26:00.000Z	JadedJacob	theadmin	thanks.
2012-02-09T18:27:00.000Z	theadmin	JadedJacob	I would also like to point out that not all bootloaders have ext4 support (old grub doesn't support ext4, and I think syslinux doesn't either)
2012-02-09T18:31:00.000Z	theadmin	JadedJacob	If you install the traditional networkmanager it will work just like in the standard edition
2012-02-09T18:32:00.000Z	theadmin	JadedJacob	Very well then, just ignore what that person said, might be their hardware.
