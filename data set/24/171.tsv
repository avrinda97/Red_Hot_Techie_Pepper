2012-04-21T22:34:00.000Z	zarax		so, my soundcard is simply not being detected by alsa
2012-04-21T22:34:00.000Z	escott	zarax	what kind of soundcard is it
2012-04-21T22:36:00.000Z	escott	zarax	is that intel HDA? sudo lshw -C sound
2012-04-21T22:38:00.000Z	escott	zarax	are the intel hda drivers loaded? lsmod | grep hda
2012-04-21T22:45:00.000Z	escott	zarax	have you looked at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HdaIntelSoundHowto
2012-04-21T22:47:00.000Z	escott	zarax	you could just try sudo modprobe. or sudo modprobe -l "snd_hda_*"
2012-04-21T22:48:00.000Z	zarax	escott	was it supposed to return anything?
2012-04-21T22:48:00.000Z	escott	zarax	the second one should. the first should not, but it might intelligently insert the modules for the devicer
2012-04-21T22:48:00.000Z	escott	zarax	l as in lima
2012-04-21T22:53:00.000Z	zarax	escott	any clue as to other possibe solutions? i'm practically on a fresh install of ubuntu (directly from windows xp)
2012-04-21T22:55:00.000Z	escott	zarax	i would try "sudo modprobe snd_hda_intel" but its also likely you will need "sudo modprobe snd_hda_codec_realtek" or some variant. you might try "sudo modprobe snd_hda_*" and see if it picks up the right modules.
2012-04-21T22:56:00.000Z	zarax	escott	the first command returned only a warning: "WARNING: All config files need .conf: /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base, it will be ignored in a future release."
2012-04-21T22:57:00.000Z	escott	zarax	what version of ubuntu is this?
2012-04-21T23:06:00.000Z	zarax	escott	Did I miss any more advice on your part after the 3 commands?
2012-04-21T23:06:00.000Z	escott	zarax	if you ran the modprobe commands see what is listed in lsmod and check lshw again to see if the device is claimed
2012-04-21T23:08:00.000Z	zarax	escott	i have snd_hda of the sorts listed in lsmod
2012-04-21T23:09:00.000Z	zarax	escott	i'm being warned by lshw to run as super user
2012-04-21T23:10:00.000Z	escott	zarax	so run with sudo
2012-04-21T23:10:00.000Z	escott	zarax	sudo lshw -C sound
2012-04-21T23:12:00.000Z	zarax	escott	and lshw does not say it's claimed
2012-04-21T23:14:00.000Z	zarax	escott	it seems to work
2012-04-21T23:15:00.000Z	escott	zarax	not sure why your sound drivers are not being loaded. perhaps the hardware is coming up late? but you could add the modules to /etc/modules
2012-04-21T23:18:00.000Z	zarax	escott	it works
2012-04-21T23:19:00.000Z	zarax	escott	thank you very much!
