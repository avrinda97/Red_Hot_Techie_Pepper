2008-01-01T21:37:00.000Z	astro76	rich__	and you are sure it didn't mount as soon as you plugged it in?
2008-01-01T21:38:00.000Z	astro76	rich__	you verified this with mount command?
2008-01-01T21:42:00.000Z	astro76	rich__	sounds like a problem with your system
2008-02-02T19:59:00.000Z	astro76	rich__	:syntax on
2008-02-02T19:59:00.000Z	astro76	rich__	if you want it default you need to use a .vimrc
2008-02-02T20:00:00.000Z	astro76	rich__	that's a command in vi
2008-02-02T20:01:00.000Z	astro76	rich__	:syntax on
2008-02-02T20:02:00.000Z	astro76	rich__	are you typing the : ?
2008-02-02T20:03:00.000Z	astro76	rich__	no space      :syntax on
2008-02-02T20:04:00.000Z	astro76	rich__	ahhhh, sudo apt-get install vim-full
2008-02-05T21:03:00.000Z	astro76	rich__	add to your ~/.vimrc
2008-02-05T21:05:00.000Z	astro76	rich__	in ~/.vimrc put a line containing syntax on (no :)
2008-02-05T21:05:00.000Z	astro76	rich__	yes make the file if you don't have it
2008-02-05T21:07:00.000Z	astro76	rich__	yes
2008-02-05T21:08:00.000Z	astro76	rich__	does it work when you type :syntax on when editing a file?
2008-02-05T21:08:00.000Z	astro76	rich__	did you restart vim?
