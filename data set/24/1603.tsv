2009-11-18T13:40:00.000Z	Spixx	syrius	have you tried with another jar file?
2009-11-18T13:41:00.000Z	Spixx	syrius	yes, how did you install java?
2009-11-18T13:42:00.000Z	Spixx	syrius	exactly :p
2009-11-18T13:42:00.000Z	Spixx	syrius	but it might be a problem with you missing parts of the java support, how did you install it?
2009-11-18T13:43:00.000Z	Spixx	syrius	goto java.com and download the install file!
2009-11-18T13:44:00.000Z	Spixx	syrius	reinstall and try again
2009-11-18T13:44:00.000Z	Spixx	syrius	then use the repos, I allways get it from source when I can but it is fully up to you :D
2009-11-18T13:47:00.000Z	Spixx	syrius	well it should be fairly simple but the errors that came out of this was to few :P it looks like it was a error stemming from you not having full java support
2009-11-18T13:47:00.000Z	Spixx	syrius	then it shouldnt be any problems :P
2009-11-18T13:49:00.000Z	Spixx	syrius	do you have a 64 bit system btw?
2009-11-18T13:50:00.000Z	Spixx	syrius	http://java.com/en/download/installed.jsp
2009-11-18T13:52:00.000Z	Spixx	syrius	then download the installer from the site and try again :D
2009-11-18T13:58:00.000Z	syrius	Spixx	where should I cd to? To install java...
2009-11-18T14:06:00.000Z	syrius	Spixx	doesn't work
