2012-09-20T00:15:00.000Z	BEC		hey there; 1 question: i installed 12.04; how do I get back my personal key(s) ?
2012-09-20T00:17:00.000Z	bekks	BEC	Which personal keys?
2012-09-20T00:18:00.000Z	BEC	bekks	gpg
2012-09-20T00:19:00.000Z	bekks	BEC	Did you reinstall Ubuntu?
2012-09-20T00:31:00.000Z	bekks	BEC	Did you format your home partition (if you had one) while reinstalling Ubuntu?
2012-09-20T00:32:00.000Z	BEC	bekks	I did after I backed it up (was deleting some folders & files i no longer need; hope i didn't mess it up!). what should I look for?
2012-09-20T00:33:00.000Z	bekks	BEC	You should look for your key files then, in your backup.
2012-09-20T00:33:00.000Z	BEC	bekks	.asc ?
2012-09-20T00:33:00.000Z	bekks	BEC	.asc is just your ascii fingerprint.
2012-09-20T00:36:00.000Z	bekks	BEC	By default, gpg stores its keys in ~/.gnupg/
2012-09-20T00:36:00.000Z	BEC	bekks	found it :D now what?
2012-09-20T00:36:00.000Z	bekks	BEC	Did you search in your backup?
2012-09-20T00:37:00.000Z	bekks	BEC	Then copy them backup to your ~/.gnupg/
2012-09-20T00:39:00.000Z	BEC	bekks	all files? (.conf|.gpg|)? replace the ones in my current home? (what would happen to contents of the currents?)
2012-09-20T00:40:00.000Z	bekks	BEC	When overwriting files, the overwritten file content is lost. Thats what happens when overwriting files. :)
2012-09-20T00:41:00.000Z	BEC	bekks	I do know that, hehe; I meant don't they contain anything imp? or just default files?
2012-09-20T00:41:00.000Z	bekks	BEC	The existing files are default files.
2012-09-20T00:42:00.000Z	BEC	bekks	done
2012-09-20T00:42:00.000Z	bekks	BEC	Use gpg as you used it before.
2012-09-20T00:50:00.000Z	BEC	bekks	THANKS :D
2012-09-20T00:51:00.000Z	BEC	bekks	had I lost them what could have I done?
2012-09-20T01:00:00.000Z	bekks	BEC	Nothing. Loosing your private key means you have no chance to recover it.
2012-09-20T01:01:00.000Z	BEC	bekks	oh; glad I backed up my home then, not just my selected folders!
2012-09-20T01:01:00.000Z	bekks	BEC	you're welcome
