2005-10-01T07:19:00.000Z	bob2	linuxmonkey	be less vague
2005-10-01T07:20:00.000Z	bob2	linuxmonkey	that's not a proper driver
2005-10-01T07:21:00.000Z	bob2	linuxmonkey	drivers for the 2.6 kernel do not have the .o extension
2005-10-01T07:21:00.000Z	bob2	linuxmonkey	where did you get that file from?
2005-10-01T07:21:00.000Z	linuxmonkey	bob2	 its made for Linux 2.6.X, so what should i do
2005-10-01T07:21:00.000Z	linuxmonkey	bob2	i got it from realtek
2005-10-01T07:23:00.000Z	bob2	linuxmonkey	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HowToSetUpNdiswrapper
2005-10-01T07:30:00.000Z	linuxmonkey	bob2	does ndiswrapper support scanning?
2005-10-01T07:31:00.000Z	bob2	linuxmonkey	don't know
2005-10-01T07:32:00.000Z	linuxmonkey	bob2	so just to make sure, a 2.4.X driver wouldnt workin in 2.6 right, cause thats the other driver they have and im almost out of options
2005-10-01T07:32:00.000Z	bob2	linuxmonkey	correct
2005-10-01T07:34:00.000Z	bob2	linuxmonkey	if it ends in .o, it's not a 2.6 module
2005-10-01T07:34:00.000Z	bob2	linuxmonkey	you'll get that error if it wasn't built for your exact kernel too, I think
2005-10-01T08:13:00.000Z	linuxmonkey	bob2	 just wanted to let you know thanks :)
2005-10-01T08:14:00.000Z	linuxmonkey	bob2	i am now speaking to you from a wifi connection, hopefully my apps will work but atleast I got wifi
2005-10-01T08:17:00.000Z	bob2	linuxmonkey	yay
2005-10-01T08:21:00.000Z	linuxmonkey	bob2	you know of any wifi linux tools, like netstunbler is for windows
2005-10-01T08:21:00.000Z	bob2	linuxmonkey	kismet
2005-10-01T08:26:00.000Z	linuxmonkey	bob2	guess i'll hqave to fork out some $ to buy a card that will work with kismet and others without using ndiswrapper
2005-10-01T08:27:00.000Z	bob2	linuxmonkey	my ipw2100 works fine with it, as do all prism-based cards
2005-10-01T08:27:00.000Z	bob2	linuxmonkey	I gather ipw2200 works fine, too
