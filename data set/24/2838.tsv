2008-07-30T22:09:00.000Z	syndr0		can anyone go private with me for a couple of minutes
2008-07-30T22:09:00.000Z	syndr0		i got one simple q and one hard q
2008-07-30T22:09:00.000Z	abbazabba	syndr0	check your messages baby
2008-07-30T23:21:00.000Z	abbazabba	syndr0	are you trying to delete something through terminal?
2008-07-30T23:21:00.000Z	abbazabba	syndr0	because you don't have permission to through gui?
2008-07-30T23:22:00.000Z	abbazabba	syndr0	if that is the case, then goto terminal, hit sudo nautilus
2008-07-30T23:22:00.000Z	abbazabba	syndr0	you should have root access to whatever you want.
2008-07-30T23:22:00.000Z	abbazabba	syndr0	yes through the gui. this is what got me passed a couple hiccups recently, through many different hard drives and external hard drives
2008-07-30T23:22:00.000Z	abbazabba	syndr0	as i said before, be careful though =D
2008-07-30T23:23:00.000Z	abbazabba	syndr0	sudo nautilus
2008-07-30T23:23:00.000Z	abbazabba	syndr0	just close the two boxes
2008-07-30T23:23:00.000Z	abbazabba	syndr0	where did i lose you
2008-07-30T23:24:00.000Z	abbazabba	syndr0	yeah, keep terminal open while yuo are messign with everything
2008-07-30T23:25:00.000Z	syndr0	abbazabba	then once i close that terminal it will end the nautilus?
2008-07-30T23:26:00.000Z	abbazabba	syndr0	i just tried it and it didn't end it, but while iwas doing everything i kept the terminal open just for good measure
2008-07-30T23:27:00.000Z	abbazabba	syndr0	as i was making changes, terminal had some code running or something.
2008-07-30T23:27:00.000Z	abbazabba	syndr0	like everytime i made a change, the terminal would change too..
2008-07-30T23:29:00.000Z	syndr0	abbazabba	is there something similar to a buddy list on irc?
2008-07-30T23:31:00.000Z	abbazabba	syndr0	i think irc has a friends list, but i haven't used irc to it's full potential since like 2000. irc is so massive it's crazy.
2008-07-30T23:32:00.000Z	syndr0	abbazabba	, rgr that, i just started to really use it, and no where near its full potential
2008-07-30T23:33:00.000Z	abbazabba	syndr0	if you are going through pidgin or something, you have no idea of the scale of irc.. this is just one server =D
2008-07-30T23:35:00.000Z	abbazabba	syndr0	what am i explaining? =]
2008-07-30T23:36:00.000Z	abbazabba	syndr0	when ubuntu is running, i just goto my 360, goto media, select video and it comes up.. it's called twonky vision, want a link?
2008-07-30T23:36:00.000Z	abbazabba	syndr0	it does it through windows too if you didn't know.
