2007-09-28T06:26:00.000Z	Comrade-Sergei		how do you get ubuntu to install on a hp laptop
2007-09-28T06:26:00.000Z	Comrade-Sergei		obviously, they have problems
2007-09-28T06:27:00.000Z	stefg	Comrade-Sergei	obviously you have a problem :-) So what is ist?
2007-09-28T06:27:00.000Z	Comrade-Sergei	stefg	when i boot to the cd and select the first option it says something about how it cant allocate rosources to the pci and it hangs on a blank screen
2007-09-28T06:28:00.000Z	stefg	Comrade-Sergei	so my guess is acpi trouble. you might need additional boot parameters as listed in !boot
2007-09-28T06:29:00.000Z	Comrade-Sergei	stefg	ive tried alot of them to no avail
2007-09-28T06:30:00.000Z	stefg	Comrade-Sergei	have you serached google and ubuntu-forums for exact model of your laptop + 'ubuntu' ususally that yields ya howto
2007-09-28T06:30:00.000Z	Comrade-Sergei	stefg	yea they dont work
2007-09-28T06:30:00.000Z	stefg	Comrade-Sergei	then the problem might be located 60 cm outside the laptop ?
2007-09-28T06:31:00.000Z	Comrade-Sergei	stefg	very funny
2007-09-28T06:32:00.000Z	stefg	Comrade-Sergei	that was not meant as a joke. Did you really . serious and carefully read the instructions, understood tehm and followed them ?
2007-09-28T06:32:00.000Z	Comrade-Sergei	stefg	yes... they dont work
2007-09-28T06:33:00.000Z	Comrade-Sergei	stefg	it just hangs on a blank screen what more do you want?!?
2007-09-28T06:34:00.000Z	stefg	Comrade-Sergei	done a media check and a memtest already? tried 'safe-mode'? tried 'noacpi noapic nolapic' as additional parameters?
2007-09-28T06:38:00.000Z	Comrade-Sergei	stefg	IdleOne if i boot to a high resolution i can get a command prompt what can i do with this
2007-09-28T06:38:00.000Z	Comrade-Sergei	stefg	IdleOne can i just do a startx?
2007-09-28T06:39:00.000Z	stefg	Comrade-Sergei	worth a try... let me guess: you have some ati mobility graphics adatper, right?
2007-09-28T06:39:00.000Z	Comrade-Sergei	stefg	no nvidia 8600 gs
2007-09-28T06:40:00.000Z	stefg	Comrade-Sergei	ah, ok... then you prolly need the nvidia 100.x series driver. Either try gutsy beta (which has it) or get it from nvidia.com and buid a driver yiurself
2007-09-28T06:47:00.000Z	Comrade-Sergei	stefg	i have the alternate cd as an iso, what would i need to do to boot to that other than to burn it obviously
2007-09-28T06:48:00.000Z	stefg	Comrade-Sergei	i'd recommend to burn it and use a CD. But there a ways to use a USB stick and other tricks
2007-09-28T06:48:00.000Z	Comrade-Sergei	stefg	well yea der, but what do i do when i get it in the drive, isnt it a cli?
2007-09-28T06:49:00.000Z	stefg	Comrade-Sergei	alternate is a textmode installer, but will set up the same system as desktop. and it still got menus and options, no nedd to type cryptic commands to start the install
2007-09-28T06:51:00.000Z	stefg	Comrade-Sergei	relax.... you'll figure it out. An old saying is: even a chicke is able to install debian (which ubuntu's alterenat installer is based on) if you put enough corn on the enter key :-)
