2008-07-05T21:51:00.000Z	bakarat		i'm running 7.10 with kernel 2.6.22 it seems, it is possible to update this to 2.6.24/25?
2008-07-05T21:51:00.000Z	bakarat		(truecrypt is complaining)
2008-07-05T21:52:00.000Z	bakarat		anyone? kernel 2.6.24/25 in ubuntu 7.10, how does one do it?
2008-07-05T21:53:00.000Z	ikonia	bakarat	dont do it
2008-07-05T21:53:00.000Z	bakarat	ikonia	but truecrypt is complaining that with kernels prior to 2.6.24, my system may freeze up randomly on writing :(
2008-07-05T21:53:00.000Z	ikonia	bakarat	but ubuntu 7.10 is not built around that kernel, so will complain a lot more
2008-07-05T21:54:00.000Z	bakarat	ikonia	is there an alternative (and preferably as easy) way to encrypt a partition in ubuntu?
2008-07-05T21:54:00.000Z	ikonia	bakarat	run the risk
2008-07-05T22:18:00.000Z	bakarat	ikonia	ok, so i can't "run the risk", because it crashes immediately :(
2008-07-05T22:18:00.000Z	bakarat	ikonia	any other solutions to get a drive encrypted in ubuntu?
2008-07-05T22:18:00.000Z	ikonia	bakarat	thats an option, sure
2008-07-05T22:18:00.000Z	bakarat	ikonia	um what is? :|
2008-07-05T22:19:00.000Z	ikonia	bakarat	sorry, I missunderstood
2008-11-10T00:28:00.000Z	ikonia	bakarat	you need to list all the groups when you usermod
2010-09-26T15:06:00.000Z	ikonia	bakarat	 * * * * *  is not a good way to test
2010-09-26T15:06:00.000Z	bakarat	ikonia	how's that?
2010-09-26T15:07:00.000Z	ikonia	bakarat	running every minute of every day - that would re-write your /tmp/test file every minute
2010-09-26T15:07:00.000Z	bakarat	ikonia	yes, just for testing
2010-09-26T15:07:00.000Z	bakarat	ikonia	the shortest time possible to test :P cba to wait too long
2010-09-26T15:07:00.000Z	ikonia	bakarat	then why are you doing >/tmp/test rather than >>/tmp/test
2010-09-26T15:08:00.000Z	bakarat	ikonia	cause i'm printing the timestamp, i just want to see it get updated
2010-09-26T15:08:00.000Z	ikonia	bakarat	and if you do >> you will see it
2010-09-26T15:08:00.000Z	ikonia	bakarat	also - use full path to the date command
2010-09-26T15:08:00.000Z	bakarat	ikonia	ok
