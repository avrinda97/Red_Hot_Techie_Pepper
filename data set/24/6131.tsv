2007-09-10T05:45:00.000Z	yanis_		fenlx, My problem is :  the window opens behind the other windows (and not on top of them), then I don't know the solution :(
2007-09-10T05:45:00.000Z	yanis_		 huji, By the way, with compiz, i don't have this problem, just with beryl, but the graphic effets are amazing with Beryl :D
2007-09-10T05:46:00.000Z	Jowi	yanis_	minimize or double click on the title bar and see if that works.
2007-09-10T05:47:00.000Z	yanis_	Jowi	Yes, for sure, when i use a window, it's ok, but when I open a windows from a menu (shortcut, programs, system), the window goes behind others windows
2007-09-10T05:48:00.000Z	Jowi	yanis_	do you have beryl-manager loaded (the red diamond in the task bar)? right click on it and reload the window manager from there. I get that problem as well from time to time.
2007-09-10T05:49:00.000Z	Jowi	yanis_	for me it mostly help to minimize a window and bring it back up again.
2007-09-10T05:49:00.000Z	yanis_	Jowi	ok i try it
2007-09-10T05:50:00.000Z	yanis_	Jowi	no it's doesn't work :/
2007-09-10T06:01:00.000Z	yanis_	Jowi	thank you very much :) it's usefull now !
2007-09-10T05:52:00.000Z	Jowi	yanis_	there should be an option in the preferences that beryl should not be "aggressive" when stealing focus. have you tried that option? if you can't find it I need to log into beryl and have a look for you but see if you can find it yourself first.
2007-09-10T05:56:00.000Z	yanis_	Jowi	I can't find this option.. I found the focus menu, but event the good options are checked, my focus windows is still so stupid.. :)
2007-09-10T05:56:00.000Z	Jowi	yanis_	ok. brb
2007-09-10T05:59:00.000Z	Jowi	yanis_	right click on the red diamond. select "beryl settings manager" in the "main" tab under General Options the sixth option (for me) reads "Level of Focus Stealing Prevention". set it to "none"
2007-09-10T06:00:00.000Z	yanis_	Jowi	You are the beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeest !!!
