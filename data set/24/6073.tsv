2006-07-27T11:44:00.000Z	dribble		well, gentoo doesn't really come with anything 'out of the box'
2006-07-27T11:44:00.000Z	dribble		gentoo comes with whatever you want gentoo to come with
2006-07-27T11:44:00.000Z	dribble		muhaha
2006-07-27T11:45:00.000Z	dribble		reading is fine
2006-07-27T11:46:00.000Z	dribble		don't play it , but google does help :-p
2006-07-27T11:47:00.000Z	dribble		may be - don't be afraid of the console . . .
2006-07-27T11:49:00.000Z	dribble		splitness
2006-07-27T11:51:00.000Z	dribble		ahh yeah, then definitely congrats!
2006-07-27T11:52:00.000Z	kbg_20	dribble	why not?
2006-07-27T11:52:00.000Z	kbg_20	dribble	hoehaver: i mean using a external software
2006-07-27T11:52:00.000Z	dribble	kbg_20	ah.  point taken
2006-07-27T11:52:00.000Z	kbg_20	dribble	hoehaver: like http://e2fsprogs.sourceforge.net/ext2.html
2006-07-27T11:53:00.000Z	dribble	kbg_20	goes to show, i learn something new everyday.
2006-07-27T11:54:00.000Z	dribble	kbg_20	but..that's for ext2
2006-07-27T11:54:00.000Z	kbg_20	dribble	it works for ext3 too...i use it myself :)
2006-07-27T11:54:00.000Z	dribble	kbg_20	good to know :p
2006-07-27T11:58:00.000Z	dribble	kbg_20	i've found there is samba client support in ubuntu.
2006-07-27T11:59:00.000Z	kbg_20	dribble	any idea how it can be enabled? smb client for nautilus?
2006-07-27T12:00:00.000Z	dribble	kbg_20	within dapper, it's on by default places->network servers
2006-07-27T12:00:00.000Z	kbg_20	dribble	i know how to use it in dapper..but what i want to know if i can kind of enable it or something in gentoo..
2006-07-27T12:01:00.000Z	dribble	kbg_20	ahh.  yeah.  i used gentoo for a good couple'a years and never really figured every thing out.  If i had to guess, it would be adding the +samba useflag when building nautilus/gnome
2006-07-27T12:02:00.000Z	kbg_20	dribble	ok..any idea where the official nautilus channel is? doesnt seem to be on freenode..?
2006-07-27T12:02:00.000Z	dribble	kbg_20	no idea, but #gentoo is always busy
2006-07-27T12:03:00.000Z	dribble	kbg_20	np ;)
