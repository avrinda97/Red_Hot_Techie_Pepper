2008-01-02T23:42:00.000Z	tribaldata	cornixx	checking the pastebin
2008-01-02T23:44:00.000Z	tribaldata	cornixx	i can't see anything wrong with it what's happening when you try to use the highest setting ?
2008-01-02T23:44:00.000Z	cornixx	tribaldata	I don'T even get the option to set it anyhwere
2008-01-02T23:46:00.000Z	tribaldata	cornixx	try to see if anyone have the same card as you  for myself i cannot see anyjthing wrong sorry
2008-01-02T23:46:00.000Z	cornixx	tribaldata	That's why I've been wondering. Everything seems alright, I just don't get the 1680 option to set anywhere
2008-01-02T23:47:00.000Z	cornixx	tribaldata	is there some cli command I could use?
2008-01-02T23:47:00.000Z	tribaldata	cornixx	checking
2008-01-02T23:55:00.000Z	tribaldata	cornixx	can't find anything of value for you
2008-01-02T23:56:00.000Z	cornixx	tribaldata	Thanks anyhow
2008-01-02T23:56:00.000Z	tribaldata	cornixx	your best bet would be to try to find a users that got the same card as you
2008-01-02T23:57:00.000Z	cornixx	tribaldata	 Spent 2 days now trying to fix that stuff, reading tons of tutorials and forums. I'm just fed up with Linux for now and be back to Win I guess
2008-01-02T23:57:00.000Z	tribaldata	cornixx	i'm sure you will find out soon, keep it as a dual boot ;)
2008-01-03T00:00:00.000Z	tribaldata	cornixx	i never asked but what are the driver your are running for your card ?
2008-01-03T00:01:00.000Z	cornixx	tribaldata	After messing around with the open source and proprietary drivers from the repo I installed envy and got the original ones
2008-01-03T00:01:00.000Z	cornixx	tribaldata	 Which at least allowed me to use dual head
2008-01-03T01:38:00.000Z	tribaldata	cornixx	you got it working nice  :) good toknow you'll stay with us :)
2008-01-03T01:41:00.000Z	tribaldata	cornixx	console based irssi :)
