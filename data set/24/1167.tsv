2010-06-10T08:16:00.000Z	vishaltelangre		Trying to convert videos to .mp4 for my nokia mobile phone, how should I do this? (video's audio quality must be mp3 and graphic quality may be like 3gp)?
2010-06-10T08:17:00.000Z	shane2peru_lapto	vishaltelangre	give openshot a try
2010-06-10T08:17:00.000Z	shane2peru_lapto	vishaltelangre	sudo apt-get install openshot
2010-06-10T08:18:00.000Z	shane2peru_lapto	vishaltelangre	or pitivi is another option, both a little buggy, but decent apps
2010-06-10T08:18:00.000Z	vishaltelangre	shane2peru_lapto	shane2peru_lapto, it does, I'm having nokia 2700c... Pitivi not have option to convert videos for my mobile phone?
2010-06-10T08:19:00.000Z	shane2peru_lapto	vishaltelangre	openshot does I couldn't remember which had it, both have options, simple conversion
2010-06-10T08:20:00.000Z	vishaltelangre	shane2peru_lapto	Previously I convert my videos on windows using nokia pc suit or using AVS converter (cracked!)
2010-06-10T08:20:00.000Z	vishaltelangre	shane2peru_lapto	Okay I'll try it... Suggest else others that you know...
2010-06-10T08:21:00.000Z	shane2peru_lapto	vishaltelangre	hmm, I never did videos till I started with Linux,  kdenlive is ok, but I don't know that it has options like openshot, if all else fails ffmpeg on command line is pretty simple, and once you get the options down, should be simple
2010-06-10T08:22:00.000Z	shane2peru_lapto	vishaltelangre	I use ffmpeg for dvd like this ffmpeg -i infile.anything.avi -target dvd-ntsc newvideo.mpg
2010-06-10T08:22:00.000Z	vishaltelangre	shane2peru_lapto	I tried w/ ffmpeg (yeah in text mode though) but not get succeed yet.. Anyway thanks... Cheers!
2010-06-10T08:23:00.000Z	shane2peru_lapto	vishaltelangre	no prob
2010-06-10T08:23:00.000Z	vishaltelangre	shane2peru_lapto	mp4 videos are mpeg, but mine mobile supports only mp4 which are exactly made for it! :)
2010-06-10T08:25:00.000Z	shane2peru_lapto	vishaltelangre	ffmpeg -i file.to.convert.flv newfile.mp4  perhaps??  You can resize it too a smaller format too, but that is roughly it.
2010-06-10T08:25:00.000Z	vishaltelangre	shane2peru_lapto	Okay I'll try... Thanks again!
2010-06-10T08:28:00.000Z	shane2peru_lapto	vishaltelangre	no prob, man ffmpeg in the terminal will give you all the options for ffmpeg
2010-06-10T08:30:00.000Z	vishaltelangre	shane2peru_lapto	ffmpeg -i One_Less_Lonely_Girl.avi newfile.mp4 gives me no such file or directory
2010-06-10T08:31:00.000Z	shane2peru_lapto	vishaltelangre	you have to be in the same directory as the avi file, or include the full path.
2010-06-10T08:31:00.000Z	vishaltelangre	shane2peru_lapto	sorry typo mistaken!
2010-06-10T08:32:00.000Z	shane2peru_lapto	vishaltelangre	if you type the first few letters then hit tab, it should auto-complete the rest, without typos. :)
2010-06-10T08:32:00.000Z	vishaltelangre	shane2peru_lapto	Unsupported codec for output stream #0.1
2010-06-10T08:33:00.000Z	shane2peru_lapto	vishaltelangre	hmm, perhaps ffmpeg doesn't like mp4, I'm pretty sure openshot should be able to do that.
2010-06-10T08:34:00.000Z	vishaltelangre	shane2peru_lapto	okay... Thanks...!
2010-06-10T08:34:00.000Z	shane2peru_lapto	vishaltelangre	no problem
