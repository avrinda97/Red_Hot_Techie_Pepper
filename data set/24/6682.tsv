2005-10-02T07:08:00.000Z	Carpe_Libertatem		I have a question. Is there a way I can see the outgoing ports that are open in Ubuntu?
2005-10-02T07:09:00.000Z	misfit_toy	Carpe_Libertatem	you mean you want to scan your system and see what ports are open?
2005-10-02T07:10:00.000Z	Carpe_Libertatem	misfit_toy	Yes, for outgoing connections, ie, which ports I can connect to on other machines.
2005-10-02T07:11:00.000Z	misfit_toy	Carpe_Libertatem	iptraf is a good tool to look at network traffic/ports/etc...
2005-10-02T07:11:00.000Z	Carpe_Libertatem	misfit_toy	iptraf, eh? That can scan ports that can potentially be used even if they're not in use?
2005-10-02T07:12:00.000Z	misfit_toy	Carpe_Libertatem	it does a ton of stuff, I can't recall what though
2005-10-02T07:12:00.000Z	misfit_toy	Carpe_Libertatem	you should hit the gibson research page and have it scan you
2005-10-02T07:12:00.000Z	Carpe_Libertatem	misfit_toy	that will scan for incoming ports

2005-10-02T07:14:00.000Z	misfit_toy	Carpe_Libertatem	what are you trying to accomplish?
2005-10-02T07:15:00.000Z	misfit_toy	Carpe_Libertatem	if you want a box with a ton of ports open then just install XP
2005-10-02T07:15:00.000Z	Carpe_Libertatem	misfit_toy	I want to see what outgoing ports are open on a certain machine as a security test.
2005-10-02T07:15:00.000Z	misfit_toy	Carpe_Libertatem	you don't understand... ingoing/outgoing....
2005-10-02T07:16:00.000Z	Carpe_Libertatem	misfit_toy	What do you call it, then, if I want to see if someone can use port 5198 to login to a remote AIM server?
2005-10-02T07:17:00.000Z	misfit_toy	Carpe_Libertatem	"someone" on "what" running what OS, with what permissions, etc...
2005-10-02T07:17:00.000Z	Carpe_Libertatem	misfit_toy	It's the firewall that is SUPPOSED to be blocking it. I want to VERIFY :-P
2005-10-02T07:18:00.000Z	misfit_toy	Carpe_Libertatem	then try to telnet to that port on the AIM server
2005-10-02T07:18:00.000Z	Carpe_Libertatem	misfit_toy	It's not that one port.
2005-10-02T07:19:00.000Z	misfit_toy	Carpe_Libertatem	please read up on basic networking.
2005-10-02T07:20:00.000Z	Carpe_Libertatem	misfit_toy	Thanks a lot. :-P
2005-10-02T07:21:00.000Z	misfit_toy	Carpe_Libertatem	I'm not trying to blow you off, but you really don't seem to understand how things work and it would take all night to figure out what in the world you're doing.
2005-10-02T07:22:00.000Z	Carpe_Libertatem	misfit_toy	What do you think I do not understand? Would my idea of pinging a range of ports on a machine with open ports not work?
2005-10-02T07:22:00.000Z	misfit_toy	Carpe_Libertatem	pinging ports?
2005-10-02T07:23:00.000Z	Carpe_Libertatem	misfit_toy	yes, say, nmap -p range mycomputerip
