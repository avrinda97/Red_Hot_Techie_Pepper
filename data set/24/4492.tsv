2007-04-02T08:00:00.000Z	robinlinth		guys, I am looking for support for a problem that i have a year now! Yes, a year. The problem is a very slow computer. Upon reinstall, it is snappy and fast, but after a few months it becomes slower and slower. My specs are not bad, so it's not that. Somebody suggested that it could be X. Okay, so, maybe it is X. Can anyone please help me with this problem? Specs: CPU: AMD Athlon 2800+, Videocard: ATI Radeon 9250, RAM: 512MB, HDD: Maxtor

2007-04-02T08:02:00.000Z	robinlinth		Can anyone help me with that one?
2007-04-02T08:03:00.000Z	robinlinth		Please?
2007-04-02T08:04:00.000Z	robinlinth		Hello?
2007-04-02T08:05:00.000Z	zulfajuniadi	robinlinth	just ask ask the question
2007-04-02T08:05:00.000Z	robinlinth	zulfajuniadi	okay:
2007-04-02T08:06:00.000Z	zulfajuniadi	robinlinth	maybe it's too bloated, checked your free memory lately?
2007-04-02T08:07:00.000Z	robinlinth	zulfajuniadi	Free memory is okay.
2007-04-02T08:07:00.000Z	robinlinth	zulfajuniadi	I tend not to use heavy programs like Azureus. Cos, like I said, i've been trying to solve this for years now
2007-04-02T08:07:00.000Z	zulfajuniadi	robinlinth	processor on idle is at ? %
2007-04-02T08:08:00.000Z	robinlinth	zulfajuniadi	minimum 4%, but it is on 18% often
2007-04-02T08:09:00.000Z	zulfajuniadi	robinlinth	examples of slowness?
2007-04-02T08:09:00.000Z	robinlinth	zulfajuniadi	slow respond times, apps don't open as fast as they used to, firefox doesn't respond too fast, all actions go slow, like, you want to open a tab, and it opens a second afterwards.
2007-04-02T08:09:00.000Z	robinlinth	zulfajuniadi	It doesn't do what you want to do, on the time you want it do do what you want it to do.
2007-04-02T08:10:00.000Z	zulfajuniadi	robinlinth	yeah, that was easy to understand. :D. is it just firefox, or other apps also?
2007-04-02T08:12:00.000Z	robinlinth	zulfajuniadi	Other apps also.
2007-04-02T08:13:00.000Z	robinlinth	zulfajuniadi	I installed Compiz yesterday, and I disabled it. BUT, it was slow BEFORE i installed Compiz. Just as slow.
2007-04-02T08:14:00.000Z	zulfajuniadi	robinlinth	try running, let say firefox, from the terminal, see what warnings and errors are hidden
2007-04-02T08:15:00.000Z	robinlinth	zulfajuniadi	alright.
2007-04-02T08:20:00.000Z	robinlinth	zulfajuniadi	Firefox gave no errors.
2007-04-02T08:21:00.000Z	zulfajuniadi	robinlinth	kde or gnome?
2007-04-02T08:21:00.000Z	robinlinth	zulfajuniadi	GNOME
2007-04-02T08:24:00.000Z	zulfajuniadi	robinlinth	try system->administration->system log
