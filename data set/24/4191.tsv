2008-07-28T00:31:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Flannel	sorry...
2008-07-28T00:34:00.000Z	Flannel	arrrghhh	login screen setup, but not sure if the shutoff time will be in there.
2008-07-28T02:18:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Flannel	sorry
2008-07-28T02:19:00.000Z	Flannel	arrrghhh	no worries.
2008-08-18T04:19:00.000Z	Flannel	arrrghhh	Did you verify the integrity of the disks?  did that passs?
2008-08-18T04:20:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Flannel	yes all passed.  i even have a 8.04.1 disc officially from ubuntu
2008-08-20T09:40:00.000Z	Flannel	arrrghhh	hook up a keyboard and REISUB?
2008-08-20T09:41:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Flannel	well when i power it off and back on, it works great.  no interference by me at all.
2008-08-20T09:45:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Flannel	i just want to figure out why the system is locking up...
2008-08-20T09:45:00.000Z	Flannel	arrrghhh	The monitor never comes out of power saving mode even while booting?
2008-08-20T09:45:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Flannel	it's fine once i reboot it.  but i want to track down the source of the lockup.  it's happened 2x now.
2008-08-20T09:46:00.000Z	Flannel	arrrghhh	Does it happen quickly or take a while?
2008-08-20T09:46:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Flannel	usually takes a while.
2008-08-20T09:47:00.000Z	Flannel	arrrghhh	Mmmm, well, if there are no logs being written successfully to disk, you might have to rely on the monitor
2008-08-22T23:05:00.000Z	Flannel	arrrghhh	sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jre
2008-08-23T08:37:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Flannel	is just quickdrawmcgraw
2008-11-03T05:13:00.000Z	Flannel	arrrghhh	Don't do that.
2008-11-03T05:13:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Flannel	that's what they were suggesting earlier sorry...
2008-11-03T05:14:00.000Z	Flannel	arrrghhh	Thats a horrible suggestion without first finding out *why* theyre still locked.
2008-11-03T05:14:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Flannel	true.  i don't see why a reboot wouldn't fix this issue tho.
2008-11-03T05:14:00.000Z	Flannel	arrrghhh	Because its likely got nothing to do with the lock file.
2008-11-03T05:15:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Flannel	okie.
2010-08-14T01:56:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Flannel	from what i've gathered, X and gnome-desktop.
