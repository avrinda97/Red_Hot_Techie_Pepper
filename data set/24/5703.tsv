2006-05-27T16:18:00.000Z	richiefrich	Cin	and i like e to much to install gnome or kde
2006-05-27T16:19:00.000Z	Cin	richiefrich	I wouldn't have thought you needed gnome or kde to run it.
2006-05-27T16:19:00.000Z	Cin	richiefrich	I mean... compiz is a window manager in itself.
2006-05-27T16:19:00.000Z	Cin		>.>
2006-05-27T16:19:00.000Z	richiefrich	Cin	it only works in GNOME kde or xfce4  atm
2006-05-27T16:20:00.000Z	richiefrich	Cin	not even fluxbox
2006-05-27T16:20:00.000Z	Cin	richiefrich	ah okay.
2006-05-27T16:20:00.000Z	Cin	richiefrich	only a matter of time though, eh?
2006-05-27T16:20:00.000Z	richiefrich	Cin	maybe for fluxbox but not e  compiz acts as a wm and e fights it
2006-05-27T16:21:00.000Z	richiefrich	Cin	without compiz theres no point, no cool options
2006-05-27T16:21:00.000Z	Cin	richiefrich	:-(
2006-05-27T16:21:00.000Z	richiefrich	Cin	so i screwed
2006-05-27T16:22:00.000Z	Cin	richiefrich	I'm hoping it's stable enough to run... like... without crashing every 14 minutes like the last version. But it seems a lot better (this update I just did) with shit loads more features. If it's stable I'll run it from now on. xD
2006-05-27T16:23:00.000Z	richiefrich	Cin	nice, i have it installed but i would need to get some GNOME stuff to run it again, cause i dont use it, and i hate metacity :P
