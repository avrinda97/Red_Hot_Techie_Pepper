2011-08-09T00:27:00.000Z	Somelauw		Does nobody use f-spot anymore?
2011-08-09T00:28:00.000Z	Somelauw		I mean, shotwell looks nice, but there is no button to import photos from my android or did I miss something.
2011-08-09T00:29:00.000Z	Somelauw		f-spot doesn't work anymore. Even after I remove my configuration it crashes again, if I try to sync it with android.
2011-08-09T00:29:00.000Z	Somelauw		NEvermind, I found it.
2011-08-09T00:30:00.000Z	Somelauw		Maybe f-spot was removed for a reason.
2011-08-09T00:30:00.000Z	zykotick9	Somelauw	ding ding ding! ;)  f-spot may stand for fail-spot, but i'm not sure.
2011-08-09T00:31:00.000Z	Somelauw	zykotick9	Maybe, I am too lazy to find the place to report this bug and to remove private info from the debug output.
2011-08-09T00:34:00.000Z	zykotick9	Somelauw	f-spot is mono-crap anyways, perhaps a native linux app would be better ;)
2011-08-09T00:44:00.000Z	zykotick9	Somelauw	usr13 melanie_ I don't consider MS's C# even if implemented on linux through Mono to be truly "native" but perhaps my initial statement went too far.
2011-08-21T23:34:00.000Z	zykotick9	Somelauw	by "some applications" do you mean vi?  if so, install vim.
2011-08-21T23:36:00.000Z	Somelauw	zykotick9	I mean weechat for example.
2011-08-21T23:36:00.000Z	zykotick9	Somelauw	sorry i haven't heard of that before, the arrow keys in default vi cause the D stuff.  good luck.
2011-09-07T02:18:00.000Z	zykotick9	Somelauw	i'm SURE
2011-09-07T02:18:00.000Z	zykotick9	Somelauw	i'm NOT SURE - but Yes
2011-09-07T02:19:00.000Z	zykotick9	Somelauw	FYI you've named to format types, where are somewhat independent of partitions - which parted is designed to work with.
2011-09-27T00:26:00.000Z	zykotick9	Somelauw	so long as you're doing a proper shutdown it "should" unmount externals fine
2012-02-01T01:27:00.000Z	zykotick9	Somelauw	love it!
2012-02-01T01:31:00.000Z	zykotick9	Somelauw	did you find a way to prevent that list? or you're script is working around it?
2012-02-01T01:32:00.000Z	Somelauw	zykotick9	This is my script: http://pastebin.com/1hR10it7 I think I'm just going to remove these files manually.
2012-02-01T01:33:00.000Z	zykotick9	Somelauw	ok, i'd like to get rid of that feature as well (i've never looked into though, was hoping to get an easy answer ;)
2012-02-01T01:36:00.000Z	zykotick9	Somelauw	look for "feh_######_######_filelist" files
2012-02-01T01:37:00.000Z	zykotick9	Somelauw	i was trying to "create" them right now, and failed.  I'm not sure where/when they come from?
2012-02-01T01:38:00.000Z	Somelauw	zykotick9	Hmm, I didn't remember seeing them them before last time when I added some wallpapers.
2012-02-01T01:39:00.000Z	zykotick9	Somelauw	i'm pretty sure, it's more often then just setting the wallpaper.  Hummm, actually the files i found where in a wallpaper folder, so maybe you're right!
