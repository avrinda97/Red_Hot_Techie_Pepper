2009-12-27T03:38:00.000Z	pozic		So, does anyone know about how to get gdm to behave like it did before?
2009-12-27T03:38:00.000Z	TomFarr	pozic	what problem?
2009-12-27T03:38:00.000Z	pozic	TomFarr	It shows at least one user, that isn't a user anymore.
2009-12-27T03:39:00.000Z	pozic	TomFarr	and I don't like it that it shows the user names.
2009-12-27T03:39:00.000Z	pozic	TomFarr	Ideally, I would like to configure a default user name, such that I only have to input my password in the common case.
2009-12-27T03:39:00.000Z	TomFarr	pozic	install xdm and configure like your like
2009-12-27T03:39:00.000Z	pozic	TomFarr	on a desktop/laptop machine there are not commonly 1000s of users ;)
2009-12-27T03:40:00.000Z	pozic	TomFarr	xdm is a bit too simplistic.
2009-12-27T03:40:00.000Z	pozic	TomFarr	I also don't like that I cannot disable the sound in gdm now.
2009-12-27T03:40:00.000Z	pozic	TomFarr	they changed far too much stuff which cannot be disabled.
2009-12-27T03:40:00.000Z	pozic	TomFarr	I read the configuration file, but there are no options, because the Gnome folks are allergic to options.
2009-12-27T03:41:00.000Z	TomFarr	pozic	all what you want can configured, just try...
2009-12-27T03:41:00.000Z	pozic	TomFarr	I tried.
2009-12-27T03:41:00.000Z	pozic	TomFarr	why do you think it is possible to configure it?
2009-12-27T03:42:00.000Z	pozic	TomFarr	SoundOnLogin=false
2009-12-27T03:42:00.000Z	pozic	TomFarr	I already set that option for example, but it does not work.
2009-12-27T03:43:00.000Z	TomFarr	pozic	 try change the sound theme
2009-12-27T03:44:00.000Z	pozic	TomFarr	changing the sound theme? For which user?
2009-12-27T03:46:00.000Z	TomFarr	pozic	hm. I think it can be configured, but how I don't know
2009-12-27T03:46:00.000Z	pozic	TomFarr	if I cannot configure it, the usability experts failed.
2009-12-27T03:47:00.000Z	pozic	TomFarr	(for the simple reason that I can patch or rewrite gdm such that it does work)
2009-12-27T03:48:00.000Z	TomFarr	pozic	I not sure it. get out the sount driver from /boot/loader.rc
2009-12-27T03:49:00.000Z	pozic	TomFarr	I don't have that file.
2009-12-27T03:49:00.000Z	TomFarr	pozic	loader.conf?
