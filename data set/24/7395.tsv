2005-02-08T08:03:00.000Z	_KonvIRC_		is ubuntu a disease?
2005-02-08T08:04:00.000Z	_KonvIRC_		have you tried vidalinux yet?
2005-02-08T08:05:00.000Z	_KonvIRC_		precompiled gentoo...pretty nice
2005-02-08T08:06:00.000Z	_KonvIRC_		uses a nice front end for emerge called porthole
2005-02-08T08:07:00.000Z	_KonvIRC_		im on xandros here, everything works straight up for me...i like that
2005-02-08T08:08:00.000Z	_KonvIRC_		face it, to get the general public interested in linux, command line is gonna have to go the way of dos
2005-02-08T08:09:00.000Z	_KonvIRC_		that means things have to be done outside of command line
2005-02-08T08:09:00.000Z	_KonvIRC_		ture dos is alive, but its dying slowly with xp out there
2005-02-08T08:10:00.000Z	_KonvIRC_		true
2005-02-08T08:10:00.000Z	zeedo	_KonvIRC_	CLI doesnt have to die for GUI to be provided
2005-02-08T08:11:00.000Z	zeedo	_KonvIRC_	MS are moving towards CLI with some of their products (ie... win2k3 server)
2005-02-08T08:12:00.000Z	zeedo	_KonvIRC_	thats one thing about ubuntu that I think is good for the user
2005-02-08T08:12:00.000Z	zeedo	_KonvIRC_	they arent tell you how to use it
2005-02-08T08:13:00.000Z	zeedo	_KonvIRC_	Im a security consultant, people WILL run under the admin/root account discouraging that is a good thing and one of Ubuntus best features
2005-02-08T08:15:00.000Z	zeedo	_KonvIRC_	why do windows boxes get hacked more easily
2005-02-08T08:15:00.000Z	zeedo	_KonvIRC_	could it be because Ms dont do what Ubuntu are trying to do ?
2005-02-08T08:17:00.000Z	zeedo	_KonvIRC_	yep, so they should prmomote security to minimise those issues
2005-02-08T08:18:00.000Z	zeedo	_KonvIRC_	so go into root, its documented as to how to do that
2005-02-08T08:21:00.000Z	zeedo	_KonvIRC_	yes, or synaptic if your prefer to use gui
2005-02-08T08:22:00.000Z	zeedo	_KonvIRC_	its documented
2005-02-08T08:23:00.000Z	zeedo	_KonvIRC_	like basic security ?
2005-02-08T08:24:00.000Z	zeedo	_KonvIRC_	basic usage is there, as is basic security
2005-02-08T08:25:00.000Z	zeedo	_KonvIRC_	what do you think is missing from ubuntu on the intuitive GUI side ?
2005-02-08T08:26:00.000Z	zeedo	_KonvIRC_	I thought synaptic was on the default install, if not it should be
