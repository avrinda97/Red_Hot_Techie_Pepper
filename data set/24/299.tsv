2011-12-27T19:19:00.000Z	CipherX	mintux	what are you using, none of those links even load for me
2011-12-27T19:20:00.000Z	CipherX	mintux	it looks like it's trying to make connections to various servers using, /ubuntu/dists/natty/partner/binary-i386/Packages, having no luck and then telling you to authenticate
2011-12-27T19:23:00.000Z	mintux	CipherX	give me your repo to test
2011-12-27T19:27:00.000Z	CipherX	mintux	sorry can't find a repo...I just downloaded the iso and installed 11.10 on my machine then from there I use either apt-get or synaptic
2011-12-27T19:27:00.000Z	mintux	CipherX	I tried this website http://repogen.simplylinux.ch/
2011-12-27T19:29:00.000Z	CipherX	mintux	http://www.ubuntu.com
2011-12-27T19:30:00.000Z	mintux	CipherX	do you confirm this document ? https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/CommandLine
2011-12-27T19:31:00.000Z	CipherX	mintux	are you trying to change where apt-get pulls packages from?
2011-12-27T19:33:00.000Z	mintux	CipherX	I tried everything but I don't why iv got 401  Authorization Required while I can open it with my browser
2011-12-27T19:33:00.000Z	CipherX	mintux	as someone stated earlier, are you behind a proxy?
2011-12-27T19:34:00.000Z	CipherX	mintux	only thing I could think of maybe...
2011-12-27T19:34:00.000Z	mintux	CipherX	proxy where  on my system ?
2011-12-27T19:34:00.000Z	mintux	CipherX	I don't do anything with my system . how can I know that?
2011-12-27T19:35:00.000Z	CipherX	mintux	don't know where...just a thought...
2011-12-27T19:35:00.000Z	CipherX	mintux	if you haven't changed anything "apt-get install <package-name>" should work find....
2011-12-27T19:36:00.000Z	CipherX	mintux	otherwise, something is configured wrong or you have a proxy or firewall blocking your connection
2011-12-27T19:36:00.000Z	mintux	CipherX	but it doesn't also update my package how can it install anything ?
2011-12-27T19:37:00.000Z	CipherX	mintux	it's just an example....but you're right if it's not getting the package there's a problem, just trying to figure out what's wrong....
