2008-02-27T09:11:00.000Z	zero88	amenado	well... Im using ndiswrapper. Have installed it from source and have installed my driver . No problem. I can use WifiRadar, Wireless Man..etc... and are able to see wireless networks. At one time I had connected after a reboot but that was only once, and hasnt happened sence. Ive tried a few things, well everything so far, but for some reason I still cannot obtain an IP. I'm not sure whats stopping me but that is my prob
2008-02-27T09:13:00.000Z	zero88	amenado	no Realtek. Luderacer Its a Gateway um... not sure the exact model
2008-02-27T09:14:00.000Z	zero88	amenado	it uses the Realtek RTL8187b driver, currently the WInXP version
2008-02-27T09:16:00.000Z	zero88	amenado	LOL no none. Ubuntu didnt even reconize the hardware. Its like it didnt exist.

2008-02-27T09:25:00.000Z	zero88	amenado	oh. well its working with ndiswrapper, i can see my network, just cant connect
2008-02-27T09:26:00.000Z	zero88	amenado	im doing it manually with sudo iwconfig esside "" but yes dhcp
2008-02-27T09:28:00.000Z	zero88	amenado	no i cant set the essid, well it doesnt still with wlan0, im reading ndiswrapper faqs right now on that rpoblem
2008-02-27T09:28:00.000Z	zero88	amenado	i have read alot of bad things about GUI network managers and such and would think it be a better idea to do it manually
