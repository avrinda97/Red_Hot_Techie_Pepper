2012-05-10T05:06:00.000Z	vfw	capitantyler	Maybe you just need to uninstall pulseaudio ?

2012-05-10T05:09:00.000Z	vfw	capitantyler	Ok, well check it out, may be some help for you there...
2012-05-10T05:10:00.000Z	capitantyler	vfw	it means that i have to abandon pulseaudio? Can i recover sound with the bug opened?
2012-05-10T05:11:00.000Z	vfw	capitantyler	Yes, you can have sound without pulseaudio
2012-05-10T05:13:00.000Z	vfw	capitantyler	I don't knwo that would be the answer to your problem, was just a wild guess.  OerHeks may have better answer(s).
