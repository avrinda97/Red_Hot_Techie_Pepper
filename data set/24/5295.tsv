2006-08-23T10:08:00.000Z	don_jr		Anyone around to answer some newbie to linux questions?
2006-08-23T10:09:00.000Z	don_jr		I'm completely new to *nix systems, want to try it out.  Is umbuntu the way I should go to see if I like it?
2006-08-23T10:11:00.000Z	don_jr		Does it support wireless networking?  And thank you for the link
2006-08-23T10:13:00.000Z	don_jr		deffinatly need to check that out then.  I already have the hardware installed on this PC using XP.....I'll look and see if it's compatible.. Thanx again
2006-08-23T10:14:00.000Z	don_jr		oh yeah, does the unbutu gnome terminal support multiple desktops like some I've read about?  that sounds very handy
2006-08-23T10:14:00.000Z	don_jr		great!
2006-08-23T10:16:00.000Z	don_jr		what's the difference between kubuntu and ubuntu it's self?
2006-08-23T10:17:00.000Z	don_jr		okay, as a first timer I'm going to keep it simple and just go with what I have downloaded...lol
2006-08-23T10:18:00.000Z	don_jr		Okay and last idiot question.  Are there many retail games and other software out that will run in a *nix system? or is it all have to be found and DL'd?
2006-08-23T10:19:00.000Z	don_jr		Okay, so why choose linux over windows or mac if the software is so limited?
2006-08-23T10:21:00.000Z	dr_willis	don_jr	 i dont find the software limited.
2006-08-23T10:23:00.000Z	dr_willis	don_jr	 define 'old and small' :) 4gb is good for a ubunut test system
2007-02-26T09:51:00.000Z	don_jr	dr_willis	directory, not folder.  I have created /home/ftp to host my ftp files, but I can't get connected to it, unless that's now how I'm to do it, I can't find help files on it that work yet.
2007-02-26T09:52:00.000Z	dr_willis	don_jr	 you did install a ftp server?
2007-02-26T09:52:00.000Z	don_jr	dr_willis	guess not, thought there was one came with ubuntu directly...I'll find one
2007-02-26T09:53:00.000Z	dr_willis	don_jr	 use of ftp is sort of being less imporntant/phasesout. ssh can do file transfers  safer.
2007-02-26T09:54:00.000Z	dr_willis	don_jr	 go get 'winscp' for windows
2007-02-26T09:55:00.000Z	dr_willis	don_jr	 or use samba
2007-02-26T09:55:00.000Z	don_jr	dr_willis	I'll look into winscp, but what is samba?
2007-02-26T09:56:00.000Z	dr_willis	don_jr	 windows is VERY annoying
2007-02-26T09:56:00.000Z	dr_willis	don_jr	 for just transfering a few files  ssh and winscp is rather easy
2007-02-26T09:58:00.000Z	don_jr	dr_willis	okay I'll look that up, not sure how to run the ssh, but will try, as for samba if I can get it to work out, this is on my home network, could come in handy.
2007-02-26T09:58:00.000Z	dr_willis	don_jr	 the 'using samba' book is available from the packages - its worth a read
2007-02-26T10:00:00.000Z	don_jr	dr_willis	apt get isn't working for samba.  I'll look up helpon the ssh server
