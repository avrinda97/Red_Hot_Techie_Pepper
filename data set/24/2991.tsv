2008-06-16T08:09:00.000Z	vdsy		ok this is a bit weird...everytime i run pidgin while in ubuntu, it stops and "segmentation fault"...
2008-06-16T08:09:00.000Z	vdsy		then i instlled kubuntu, and pidgin runs fine
2008-06-16T08:09:00.000Z	vdsy		leads u straight to sudoers
2008-06-16T08:10:00.000Z	vdsy		but i think you mkight still have to use sudo for it
2008-06-16T08:10:00.000Z	doorknob60	vdsy	can u use a different messenger program like kopete or aMSN?
2008-06-16T08:12:00.000Z	vdsy	doorknob60	im using kopete...but im jsut wondering what went wrong with it...
2008-06-16T08:12:00.000Z	vdsy		wiht pidgin
2008-06-16T08:12:00.000Z	doorknob60	vdsy	okay, try sudo aptitude purge pidgin then sudo aptitude install pidgin
2008-06-16T08:13:00.000Z	vdsy		dpkg-reconfigure, reinstall none worked and then i installed kubuntu-desktop and now its fine
2008-06-16T08:13:00.000Z	vdsy		i did that too
2008-06-16T08:13:00.000Z	vdsy		didnt work
2008-06-16T08:13:00.000Z	vdsy		assuming that, one of the things kubuntu installs made pidgin work, not sure what it is
2008-06-16T08:14:00.000Z	doorknob60		hmm weird
2008-06-16T08:14:00.000Z	vdsy		yes it is
2008-06-16T08:14:00.000Z	doorknob60		so does it only work in kde and not gnome?
2008-06-16T08:14:00.000Z	vdsy		even purged and reinstalled some of its dependencies
2008-06-16T08:14:00.000Z	vdsy		havent gone back to gnome yet, i jsut got kubuntu here about 109 minutes ago
2008-06-16T08:14:00.000Z	doorknob60		ok
2008-06-16T08:15:00.000Z	doorknob60		i guess kde is magic :D kde ftw
2008-06-16T08:16:00.000Z	doorknob60		prefers KDE... more customizable
2008-06-16T08:16:00.000Z	vdsy	doorknob60	sound is now a problem as id expected
2008-06-16T08:16:00.000Z	vdsy		vlc sounds just got cut off
2008-06-16T08:16:00.000Z	doorknob60	vdsy	why did you expect sound problems?
2008-06-16T08:18:00.000Z	vdsy	doorknob60	gnome and kde uses different sound servers, as far back as i can remember
