2005-12-17T17:07:00.000Z	mephis1987		i have problem with make command when installing a software
2005-12-17T17:07:00.000Z	mephis1987		oh
2005-12-17T17:08:00.000Z	mephis1987		everything runs fine until make command
2005-12-17T17:08:00.000Z	mephis1987		and sudo make install
2005-12-17T17:08:00.000Z	sethk	mephis1987	looks like the X dev files are not installed
2005-12-17T17:09:00.000Z	sethk	mephis1987	the missing file (X.h) will be there when you install X development
2005-12-17T17:11:00.000Z	sethk	mephis1987	you can add a link of /usr/include/X11 to /usr/X11/include
2005-12-17T17:11:00.000Z	sethk	mephis1987	sorry, I was wrong about the file location, I was looking at an older machine.  The ubuntu (xorg) location is indeed /usr/include/X11
2005-12-17T17:12:00.000Z	sethk	mephis1987	a link is an alias for a file or a directory
2005-12-17T17:12:00.000Z	sethk	mephis1987	your software is looking for /usr/X11/include/X.h, but your machine has /usr/include/X11/X.h
2005-12-17T17:12:00.000Z	sethk	mephis1987	so if you do this:  sudo ln -s /usr/include/X11 /usr/X11/include, the file will be found by make
2005-12-17T17:13:00.000Z	sethk	mephis1987	add, not change
2005-12-17T17:13:00.000Z	sethk	mephis1987	you leave everything as it is so you don't screw up all the programs that are correctly configured.  :)
2005-12-17T17:13:00.000Z	sethk	mephis1987	but adding a link is safe
2005-12-17T17:14:00.000Z	sethk	mephis1987	right, then try it.  You may simply get a different error, but it is definitely worth a try.
2005-12-17T17:15:00.000Z	sethk	mephis1987	in that case you probably do need to install the X dev files
2005-12-17T17:16:00.000Z	sethk	mephis1987	if that's the case, the software may well be smart enough to find the file in the correct place
2005-12-17T17:16:00.000Z	sethk	mephis1987	right.  install X dev support and try your build again.  Then if it is still failing, and /usr/include/X11/X.h exists, we go back to the link
