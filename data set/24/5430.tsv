2006-07-29T11:38:00.000Z	jrinco11	Taxman	 there is a proprietary external cd drive, i just don't have it
2006-07-29T11:32:00.000Z	Taxman	jrinco11	is that usb? is it recognized on boot or when you plug it in?
2006-07-29T11:33:00.000Z	jrinco11	Taxman	 nah, it's pcmcia, and when i plug it in, nothin happens
2006-07-29T11:33:00.000Z	Taxman	jrinco11	do you boot with it already plugged in?
2006-07-29T11:33:00.000Z	jrinco11	Taxman	 and no, doesn't do anything upon boot or if i plug it in while
2006-07-29T11:33:00.000Z	jrinco11	Taxman	 yah, i've tried booting with it, still nothing
2006-07-29T11:34:00.000Z	Taxman	jrinco11	try verbose boot, then check to boot logs for the scan results
2006-07-29T11:34:00.000Z	Taxman	jrinco11	the card may not have free drivers and you may have to use NDIS
2006-07-29T11:34:00.000Z	jrinco11	Taxman	 the way I installed ubuntu is by putting the hdd in a nother laptop to have the live cd copy the install files onto theo hdd, then i removed the hdd at reboot and put it in my tavelmate 340 to finish the install -- perhaps it doesn't recognize the pcmcia slot?  (is that possible?  cuase I had to reconfigure xorg to detect my display cuase ti was looking for the ati display fro mthe laptop i originally started the install on)
2006-07-29T11:34:00.000Z	jrinco11	Taxman	 i'll try that, one sec
2006-07-29T11:35:00.000Z	jrinco11	Taxman	 i'm actually really new to all this, how would I do verbose boot?
2006-07-29T11:35:00.000Z	Taxman	jrinco11	yes, that is concievable that the installer would not have installed the PCMCIA if you installed on another box
2006-07-29T11:35:00.000Z	jrinco11	Taxman	 and now that you mention it, i was on google reading about how people wre having to use some files from teh windows driver and wrapping it up w/something else
2006-07-29T11:36:00.000Z	Taxman	jrinco11	I have to look it up every time
2006-07-29T11:36:00.000Z	jrinco11	Taxman	 any idea how i woudl get the pcmcia slot "installed"?
2006-07-29T11:36:00.000Z	Taxman	jrinco11	yes that's the NDIS stuff that would mean your card needs that
2006-07-29T11:36:00.000Z	Taxman	jrinco11	I'm not the best to help, I'm just trying to give you what pointers I can
2006-07-29T11:37:00.000Z	jrinco11	Taxman	 and would there ahve been a better way to install ubuntu than the way I did?  (like i said, i've got an old acer travelmade 340 w/no usb boot support (so no external drive for installation) and no working thernet
2006-07-29T11:37:00.000Z	jrinco11	Taxman	 it's all good, i still appreciate it
2006-07-29T11:37:00.000Z	Taxman	jrinco11	floppy?
2006-07-29T11:38:00.000Z	jrinco11	Taxman	 nope -- nothing lol
2006-07-29T11:38:00.000Z	jrinco11	Taxman	 so i guess my best solution would be to get a hold of that --- yah, i figured lol
2006-07-29T11:39:00.000Z	jrinco11	Taxman	 i did finally get everytign elseworking at least :-) (besides wireless, and pcmcia apparently lol)
2006-07-29T11:39:00.000Z	jrinco11	Taxman	 thanks again
