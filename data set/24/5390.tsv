2006-08-13T05:35:00.000Z	simsalabim		anyone know how to assign multiple ip addresses (for use with ip based virtual hosts) to an interface?
2006-08-13T05:37:00.000Z	longwave	simsalabim	read /usr/share/doc/ifupdown/examples/network-interfaces.gz - there are examples for interface aliases in there
2006-08-13T05:38:00.000Z	simsalabim	longwave	thanks, i just wasnt sure of the exact term to look for
2006-08-13T05:43:00.000Z	longwave	simsalabim	use "zless"
2006-08-13T05:43:00.000Z	simsalabim	longwave	again: thanks :-))
2006-08-13T06:12:00.000Z	longwave	simsalabim	yes, that's the debian/ubuntu way of doing it - but you can use "a2ensite" to create the symlink for you
2006-08-13T06:13:00.000Z	simsalabim	longwave	Saviq I see, you wouldnt have a link to some reading about that? I mean there is probably a good reason why its like that. Or is it just to keep apache2.conf simpler?
2006-08-13T06:13:00.000Z	longwave	simsalabim	yes, it's just to make management easier
2006-08-13T06:14:00.000Z	longwave	simsalabim	i name the file the same as the vhost, then i can use "a2ensite" and "a2dissite" to easily turn vhosts on and off
2006-08-13T06:14:00.000Z	simsalabim	longwave	ah, okay... just thought there would be further wizardry behind it
2006-08-13T06:15:00.000Z	longwave	simsalabim	the apache modules are handled in a similar way, that's done so you can have packages that install further apache modules that can be enabled/disabled just as easily
2006-08-13T06:16:00.000Z	simsalabim	longwave	ah, okay... that seems nice and clean
2006-08-13T06:17:00.000Z	simsalabim	longwave	does debian/ubuntu have some util to manage and install several instances of for instance the same content management system?
2006-08-13T06:18:00.000Z	longwave	simsalabim	that depends on the cms, i guess
2006-08-13T06:18:00.000Z	longwave	simsalabim	most of them have some way of installing multiple sites on the same server, usually just through a different database name and/or storage directory
2006-08-13T06:20:00.000Z	simsalabim	longwave	ok, i just remember something on gentoo... webapp-config.. that did it for you.. not that i think i will miss it
2006-08-13T06:22:00.000Z	longwave	simsalabim	hrm, that webapp-config looks interesting, there's nothing like that in debian/ubuntu that i know of
2006-08-13T06:23:00.000Z	simsalabim	longwave	ok, im not experienced enough to know if its really useful or not.. i guess if you have to install loads of instances of the same site something like that could be useful
2006-08-13T06:24:00.000Z	longwave	simsalabim	yeah, and if you're doing that, you're probably going to want custom scripts anyway
2006-08-13T06:24:00.000Z	longwave	simsalabim	also, i imagine handling security updates could be a nightmare if you aren't careful
2006-08-13T06:25:00.000Z	simsalabim	longwave	im not sure but i would guess that portage together netapp-config would handle that
2006-08-13T06:32:00.000Z	simsalabim	longwave	thanks for all your help, nn to you all
