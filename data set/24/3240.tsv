2009-02-23T11:08:00.000Z	ma5t3rw1tt		I have a bootable ubuntu usb stick and i only have 1gig. I was wondering if I wanna install programs and things if I can install them maybe on a different flash drive, maybe have 1 flash drive which is my OS and another one to save files on?
2009-02-23T11:09:00.000Z	ma5t3rw1tt		Anyone?
2009-02-23T11:11:00.000Z	b1n42y	ma5t3rw1tt	i would guess you need to setup a link .. not sure how though
2009-02-23T11:11:00.000Z	b1n42y	ma5t3rw1tt	i think its called sym link (symbolic)
2009-02-23T11:12:00.000Z	ma5t3rw1tt	b1n42y	Thats what I was thinking. But how would I install a program from lets say Synaptic or something onto another storage device?
2009-02-23T11:13:00.000Z	ma5t3rw1tt	b1n42y	So lets say I wanted to install VLC player, but not install it on the stick that has my OS but wanna install it on another 1gig flash drive that I have, but leave that flash drive connected, how would I go about doing that?
2009-02-23T11:13:00.000Z	b1n42y	ma5t3rw1tt	im guessing if you set the link up it will store it in wherever you set the link too, maybe even add it to a config file also, no idea how though, google if no answers come here after youve waited for a bit
2009-02-23T11:15:00.000Z	b1n42y	ma5t3rw1tt	also it would be the bin file that you are linking, not sure if ubuntu will like that
2009-02-23T11:16:00.000Z	ma5t3rw1tt	b1n42y	Do you have any idea on how I would download something onto another storage device from synaptic?
2009-02-23T11:16:00.000Z	b1n42y	ma5t3rw1tt	also maybe it involves setting up a seperate partion on that othe usb and calling it \bin
2009-02-23T11:16:00.000Z	ma5t3rw1tt	b1n42y	So instead of it downloading like where it normally goes, it would be elsewhere?
2009-02-23T11:17:00.000Z	b1n42y	ma5t3rw1tt	i know what your talking about, i have been giving you ideas on what to search for on google as noone here seems to know at the moment
2009-02-23T11:18:00.000Z	ma5t3rw1tt	b1n42y	And yes your ideas are helpin, just trying to figure this out. I am sure something so simple as this can b done
2009-02-23T11:18:00.000Z	b1n42y	ma5t3rw1tt	thats why i suggested the bin partition
2009-02-23T11:19:00.000Z	b1n42y	ma5t3rw1tt	ubuntu might handle the rest automatically
2009-02-23T11:19:00.000Z	ma5t3rw1tt	b1n42y	would that screw up my bootable OS from the usb stick it boots from?
2009-02-23T11:19:00.000Z	b1n42y	ma5t3rw1tt	i would assume so without any additionaly tweaks
2009-02-23T11:20:00.000Z	b1n42y	ma5t3rw1tt	i was thinking from scratch approach
2009-02-23T11:21:00.000Z	ma5t3rw1tt	b1n42y	I rather not have to go through setting all this up again. I booted into Windows at the moment. I am just trying to figure things out
2009-02-23T11:21:00.000Z	b1n42y	ma5t3rw1tt	any file (folder) such as bin where programs are kept can have its own partition so during install ... would be easiest without knowledge of additional tweaks needed
2009-02-23T11:22:00.000Z	b1n42y	ma5t3rw1tt	try google... or come back later :)
2009-02-23T11:22:00.000Z	ma5t3rw1tt	b1n42y	Well its not like this is a dual boot or whatever, Ubuntu 8.10 is installed on a 1gig USB Flash Drive.
2009-02-23T11:23:00.000Z	b1n42y	ma5t3rw1tt	no probs sorry couldnt help more
2009-02-23T11:24:00.000Z	b1n42y	ma5t3rw1tt	you can pickup 16gb for 49 AUD, but yeah i know whats its like when cash no ere, ere no cash
