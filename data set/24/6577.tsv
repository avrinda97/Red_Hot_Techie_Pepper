2007-03-15T15:15:00.000Z	sipior	mneptok	he knows :)
2007-03-26T15:55:00.000Z	sipior	mneptok	does shit count as profanity anymore? i think that might be a locale setting now
2007-03-26T15:55:00.000Z	mneptok	sipior	would a ban count as a "yes?"
2007-03-26T15:56:00.000Z	sipior	mneptok	in a goose-stepping sort of way, i think it might :-)
2007-03-26T15:56:00.000Z	mneptok	sipior	i can now invoke Godwin's Law and win this debate by default. and i do so. ;)
2010-07-28T19:54:00.000Z	sipior	mneptok	i was going to ask... :-)
2011-12-06T22:55:00.000Z	sipior	mneptok	but if you try sometimes...
2011-12-06T22:56:00.000Z	mneptok	sipior	can i be Keith? i like Brian Jones' hair, but i'm too good a swimmer.
2012-01-31T20:09:00.000Z	mneptok	sipior	i'd include "sudo" in any and all commands you suggest that require it.
2012-01-31T20:10:00.000Z	sipior	mneptok	you can do as you like.
2012-02-28T20:33:00.000Z	sipior	mneptok	hope your day job pays well
2012-03-12T20:11:00.000Z	sipior	mneptok	the default ubuntu installer puts /boot on lvm. that's what initrd is for.
2012-03-12T20:11:00.000Z	sipior	mneptok	in fact, i just did it ten minutes ago :-)
2012-03-12T20:11:00.000Z	mneptok	sipior	and it's a bad idea.
2012-03-12T20:11:00.000Z	sipior	mneptok	you're mistaken.
2012-03-12T20:11:00.000Z	mneptok	sipior	i assure you, i am not. :)
2012-03-12T20:12:00.000Z	sipior	mneptok	well, at least you're confident in your ignorance. of course, that's the problem.
2012-03-12T20:13:00.000Z	sipior	mneptok	perhaps you would care to explain why the ubuntu installer selects that as a default? what do you know that they do not?
2012-03-12T20:13:00.000Z	sipior	mneptok	perhaps you should tell them.
2012-03-12T20:14:00.000Z	mneptok	sipior	i have. when i worked there. but it's a d-i inheritance no one wants to dance with.
2012-03-12T20:14:00.000Z	mneptok	sipior	hence, myself and other Senior Ubuntu Support Analysts for Canonical always recommended against it, with the full blessing of the dev team.
2012-03-12T20:15:00.000Z	sipior	mneptok	and yet you made the installer...
2012-03-12T20:15:00.000Z	mneptok	sipior	no, Debian did. as i said.
2012-03-12T20:16:00.000Z	sipior	mneptok	ah, well they know what they're doing, at least. anyway, this isn't going anywhere.
