2010-08-16T20:41:00.000Z	datta		E: Broken packages
2010-08-16T20:41:00.000Z	datta		any idea how I can fix this? I have been dealing with this for a long time, please help
2010-08-16T20:42:00.000Z	datta		please someone help me with broken packages
2010-08-16T20:42:00.000Z	soreau	datta	Do you have any output from this?  sudo grep ppa /etc/apt/sources.list
2010-08-16T20:43:00.000Z	datta	soreau	I get this output: # deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/jason-scheunemann/ppa/ubuntu jaunty main # disabled on upgrade to jaunty
2010-08-16T20:44:00.000Z	soreau	datta	So its an upgrade plus you still have some ppas enabled. I suggest a clean install as a sure fix
2010-08-16T20:44:00.000Z	datta	soreau	do I have to clean install ubuntu? there is no way other than that?
2010-08-16T20:45:00.000Z	soreau	datta	The other way is to fix your broken packages, which may be very simple or quite impossible depending on what all youve done to break it
2010-08-16T20:46:00.000Z	soreau	datta	Yea the first thing would be to comment out that ppa, then run apt-get update && apt-get upgrade
2010-08-16T20:46:00.000Z	soreau	datta	See if it succeeds and go from there
2010-08-16T20:47:00.000Z	datta	soreau	what do you actually mean by commenting out?
2010-08-16T20:47:00.000Z	datta	soreau	I tried to install sopcast and that caused the break
2010-08-16T20:48:00.000Z	soreau	datta	Lines that start with # are ignored by the system and are called comments
2010-08-16T20:51:00.000Z	soreau	datta	Look at the output of apt-cache policy compiz
2010-08-16T20:51:00.000Z	soreau	datta	Its probably that you have old packages lying around from the upgrade
2010-08-16T20:52:00.000Z	datta	soreau	this the output I get from apt-cache policy compiz http://paste.ubuntu.com/478916/
2010-08-16T20:53:00.000Z	soreau	datta	Which version of ubuntu are you currently running?
2010-08-16T20:54:00.000Z	datta	soreau	10.04
2010-08-16T20:54:00.000Z	soreau	datta	Now, you see the output of apt-cache? It says you have compiz from lucid repos
2010-08-16T20:55:00.000Z	datta	soreau	this is the output http://paste.ubuntu.com/478917/
2010-08-16T20:55:00.000Z	soreau	datta	You need to make sure you have no lucid repos enabled (grep lucid /etc/apt/sources.list) then run apt-get update and reinstall all compiz packages
2010-08-16T21:00:00.000Z	datta	soreau	you mean the installation that I was following was just an workaround, it is from softpedia
2010-08-16T21:00:00.000Z	soreau	datta	Comment out any repos in your sources.list that arent lucid, then do apt-get update and reinstall all compiz packages
