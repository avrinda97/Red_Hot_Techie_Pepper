2007-03-05T17:14:00.000Z	TheVault		nope, none of those command extracts the files from a exe
2007-03-05T17:14:00.000Z	TheVault		Does anybody else know how?
2007-03-05T17:15:00.000Z	TheVault		Anybody know the command to get the files out of a exe file?
2007-03-05T17:16:00.000Z	soundray	TheVault	there is no single command that does that, and it is not necessarily possible
2007-03-05T17:16:00.000Z	soundray	TheVault	you may have to run it with wine
2007-03-14T13:03:00.000Z	soundray	TheVault	please don't use su, ubuntu is designed to be used with sudo
2007-03-14T13:03:00.000Z	TheVault	soundray	Alrighty I won't mess with it then
2007-03-14T13:04:00.000Z	soundray	TheVault	to use su, you would have to unlock the root account, which opens a security hole.
2007-03-14T13:04:00.000Z	soundray	TheVault	have you tried sudo -i ?
2007-03-14T13:05:00.000Z	TheVault	soundray	Thanks
2007-03-14T13:08:00.000Z	TheVault	soundray	So when I do the sudo -i command, I don't have to constantly do the sudo for each command that I wanna give?
2007-03-14T13:08:00.000Z	soundray	TheVault	exactly
2007-03-17T12:13:00.000Z	soundray	TheVault	have a look at tpconfig and gsynaptics
2007-03-17T12:13:00.000Z	soundray	TheVault	you can disable the touchpad when it's not in use
2007-03-17T12:13:00.000Z	TheVault	soundray	Will those programs help?
2007-03-17T12:14:00.000Z	TheVault	soundray	YAY, That Gsynaptics looks to be my answer :)
2007-03-17T12:15:00.000Z	TheVault	soundray	Yes indeed. Thanks for the find :)
2007-03-17T12:15:00.000Z	soundray	TheVault	hope your tp is compatible with it
2007-03-17T12:15:00.000Z	TheVault	soundray	tp?
2007-03-17T12:16:00.000Z	TheVault	soundray	Well my touchpad is a Synaptics Touchpad, so it should work right?
2007-03-17T12:19:00.000Z	TheVault	soundray	So ya think I should download and install gsynaptics then?
2007-03-17T12:19:00.000Z	soundray	TheVault	yeah, why not?
2007-03-17T12:19:00.000Z	TheVault	soundray	alrighty, I'm going for it
2007-03-17T12:19:00.000Z	TheVault	soundray	Thanks again :)
