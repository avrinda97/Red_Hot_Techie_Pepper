2009-01-03T16:49:00.000Z	rww	archman	good luck, you'll need it >.>
2009-01-03T17:35:00.000Z	rww	archman	congratulations :D. I honestly didn't expect that to work! (Thanks for letting us know that it did!)
2009-01-03T17:36:00.000Z	archman	rww	yes, even all plugins worked, although i bypassed some of them, they are not needed to me...so a little dep solving, and thats it!
2009-01-03T17:37:00.000Z	archman	rww	btw.: this is my conf:  ./configure --disable-screensaver --disable-meanwhile --disable-perl --disable-tk
2009-01-03T17:37:00.000Z	rww	archman	thanks
2009-01-03T17:37:00.000Z	archman	rww	np, gutsy lives on!
2009-01-03T17:51:00.000Z	archman	rww	sry
2009-01-05T15:12:00.000Z	rww	archman	ask in #winehq
2009-01-05T15:12:00.000Z	rww	archman	it'll probably end up involving passing an option to ./configure, though, if wine is anything like most other programs.
2009-01-05T15:13:00.000Z	archman	rww	i did configure --prefix to another location...
2009-01-05T15:13:00.000Z	rww	archman	then make install should install it to that other location.
2009-01-05T15:15:00.000Z	archman	rww	they answered me to just run the shortcut in the root of the source (the one that points to /tools/winewrapper
2009-02-07T15:50:00.000Z	rww	archman	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases has a nice list of releases and their support periods
2011-08-18T01:42:00.000Z	archman	rww	linux is not part of ubuntu ;)
2011-08-18T01:43:00.000Z	rww	archman	Ubuntu uses the Linux kernel.
2011-08-18T01:43:00.000Z	archman	rww	yes
