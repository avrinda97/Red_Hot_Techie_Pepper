2011-12-26T00:15:00.000Z	urlin2u	arrrghhh	you tried a f12 prompt at powering on ti get a boot menu for the usb's
2011-12-26T00:15:00.000Z	arrrghhh	urlin2u	it will attempt to boot from the usb key's, but it always hangs.
2011-12-26T00:16:00.000Z	urlin2u	arrrghhh	you have md5 summed the original iso ?
2011-12-26T00:16:00.000Z	arrrghhh	urlin2u	one is an official disc that's worked great in the past (it's old, 9.04).
2011-12-26T00:35:00.000Z	urlin2u	arrrghhh	you using the cd download on the dvd or the dvd download?
2011-12-26T00:36:00.000Z	arrrghhh	urlin2u	i believe it was the cd version burned to a dvd.
2011-12-26T00:36:00.000Z	arrrghhh	urlin2u	but i also have an official 9.04 cd from ubuntu
2011-12-26T00:37:00.000Z	urlin2u	arrrghhh	not sure but I think that could be a problem, I think you just have a series of shortcuts that is burning you.
2011-12-26T00:37:00.000Z	arrrghhh	urlin2u	i honestly don't know.  seems everything is against me today :/
2011-12-26T00:37:00.000Z	urlin2u	arrrghhh	wha happens when you boot the 9.04
2011-12-26T00:37:00.000Z	arrrghhh	urlin2u	kernel panic
2011-12-26T00:38:00.000Z	urlin2u	arrrghhh	you say kernel panic is it just a black screen.
2011-12-26T00:38:00.000Z	arrrghhh	urlin2u	no it says kernel panic, not syncing blah blah.  then the caps lock flashes constantly.  same when i try to boot 3.0.0.14 from the hdd.
2011-12-26T00:40:00.000Z	urlin2u	arrrghhh	so as of now it bots straight to XP?
2011-12-26T00:40:00.000Z	arrrghhh	urlin2u	i get the grub2 menu.  xp is the only thing that boots consistently, tho.
2011-12-26T00:41:00.000Z	urlin2u	arrrghhh	you can do a manual boot in I will find you a link.
2011-12-26T00:42:00.000Z	urlin2u	arrrghhh	here you go read carefully every space and input has to be perfect to work, took me a while to figure it out when practicing.  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2#Boot_a_Specific_Kernel_Manually
2011-12-26T00:43:00.000Z	arrrghhh	urlin2u	thanks for the link, but that isn't my issue.  i do see the grub menu, and i can boot specific kernels.  they just all fail.
2011-12-26T00:44:00.000Z	urlin2u	arrrghhh	you sure it is 11.10 not 12.04 it has a kernel crash problem?
2011-12-26T00:44:00.000Z	arrrghhh	urlin2u	positive.
2011-12-26T00:48:00.000Z	urlin2u	arrrghhh	since you have a slow download I would consider a slitaz or puppy linux download both are really small, and see if you can boot either. You know whats best with what yo have though.
2011-12-26T00:48:00.000Z	arrrghhh	urlin2u	hrm.  ok.
2011-12-26T01:00:00.000Z	urlin2u	arrrghhh	how would you reinstall wuith a wubi?
2011-12-26T01:00:00.000Z	arrrghhh	urlin2u	it's not wubi, it's installed natively.
