2011-11-28T02:49:00.000Z	srk9		Why doesn't ubuntu-10.04.3-server-i386.manifest exist?
2011-11-28T02:50:00.000Z	reisio	srk9	what would it have in it?
2011-11-28T02:50:00.000Z	srk9	reisio	The equivalent of http://releases.ubuntu.com/lucid/ubuntu-10.04.3-desktop-i386.manifest
2011-11-28T02:51:00.000Z	reisio	srk9	dunno
2011-11-28T02:52:00.000Z	reisio	srk9	maybe because people looking for a server install just want fewer packages
2011-11-28T02:52:00.000Z	srk9	reisio	I really don't see the distinction between desktop and server, but want I really want is a list of all packages I explicitly installed.
2011-11-28T02:53:00.000Z	reisio	srk9	you can get the list after installation, sorry dunno where you'd get a manifest beforehand
2011-11-28T02:53:00.000Z	srk9	reisio	How do I get the list?
2011-11-28T02:54:00.000Z	reisio	srk9	dpkg -l, IIRC
2011-11-28T02:54:00.000Z	srk9	reisio	How does that help me if I want to find out all packages I installed myself?
2011-11-28T02:54:00.000Z	srk9	reisio	Right now, I am doing wget -qO - http://releases.ubuntu.com/lucid/ubuntu-10.04.3-desktop-i386.manifest | cut -d" " -f1 | sort | uniq > /tmp/defaultinstalled.txt; (for i in $(cat currentlyinstalled.txt); do if [ "$(grep -xc $i auto)" -eq 0 -a "$(grep -xc $i /tmp/defaultinstalled.txt)" -eq 0 ]; then echo $i; fi; done;)
2011-11-28T02:55:00.000Z	reisio	srk9	ah yourself
2011-11-28T02:55:00.000Z	reisio	srk9	there should be a log somewhere, you should be able to just cut out those before a certain date
2011-11-28T02:55:00.000Z	srk9	reisio	But I don't want their dependencies.
2011-11-28T02:56:00.000Z	reisio	srk9	there's some command with aptitude or something
2011-11-28T02:59:00.000Z	reisio	srk9	maybe dpkg --get-selections
2011-11-28T02:59:00.000Z	reisio	srk9	if Canonical were up to that, they wouldn't have just copied Debian :p
2011-11-28T02:59:00.000Z	reisio	srk9	I'm sure there are existing scripts, people don't fix things that aren't broken, it's sort of a problem with old software, and sort of not
2011-11-28T03:18:00.000Z	reisio	srk9	I'm sure there's a tool for what you want
2011-11-28T03:18:00.000Z	reisio	srk9	obviously there isn't (apparently?) anything as lovely as Gentoo's /var/lib/portage/world
2011-11-28T03:18:00.000Z	reisio	srk9	but I'm sure you can get the same result
2011-11-28T03:18:00.000Z	reisio	srk9	you could check /var/db/pkg/, though
2011-11-28T03:21:00.000Z	srk9	reisio	What would I find there that would help me obtain a list of all explicitly installed packages?
2011-11-28T03:21:00.000Z	reisio	srk9	... a list of all explicitly installed packages, quite possibly
