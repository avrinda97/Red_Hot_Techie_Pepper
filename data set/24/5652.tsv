2006-05-30T09:48:00.000Z	grndslm	haloe	if that's the case... open up a terminal and type in "sudo cdrecord <nameofiso>.iso

2006-05-30T09:48:00.000Z	grndslm		you might have to enable some certain repositories in your /etc/apt/sources.list file
2006-05-30T09:49:00.000Z	haloe		I mean bootable cd would be the button but from an iso it would be something else right?

2006-05-30T09:51:00.000Z	grndslm	haloe	i'd recommend that you place a shortcut on your panel because you should get used to using the terminal...
