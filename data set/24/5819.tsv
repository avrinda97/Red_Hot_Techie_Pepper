2006-06-10T05:54:00.000Z	Warbo		Quick question, does the Live CD use gksudo (I am writing a guide)?
2006-06-10T05:56:00.000Z	Healot	Warbo	full-fledge GNOME desktop uses "gksu(do)"
2006-06-10T05:56:00.000Z	Warbo	Healot	Is it installed in the Live CD's system though?
2006-06-10T05:57:00.000Z	Healot	Warbo	run it from the terminal, you'll see
2006-06-10T05:57:00.000Z	Warbo	Healot	I don;t have the Live CD, that's why I'm asking :)
2006-06-10T05:58:00.000Z	Healot	Warbo	yes
2006-06-11T12:46:00.000Z	Warbo	Healot	Mainly because WINE Is Not an Emulator :)
2006-06-11T12:48:00.000Z	Warbo	Healot	It is useful, but I try to use only FLOSS and most FLOSS has Linux ports
2006-06-11T12:49:00.000Z	Warbo	Healot	I think that programs should be able to run on any machine, even if it involves emulation. That is why I respect Apple whenever they switch architecture (at least they DO switch architecture, unlike one company I could name)
2006-06-11T12:50:00.000Z	Warbo	Healot	backslash is an abomination in a filesystem
2006-06-11T12:58:00.000Z	Healot	Warbo	update the plugin list using KDE control panel
2006-06-11T13:02:00.000Z	Warbo	Healot	Amarok takes a while to respond when changing tracks to a musepack file (around 2 seconds to display OSD etc.)
2006-06-11T13:02:00.000Z	Warbo	Healot	Nope. Everything else is Mp3 and OGG with no problems
2006-06-11T13:03:00.000Z	Healot	Warbo	maybe it's the plugin itself
2006-06-11T13:03:00.000Z	Warbo	Healot	I think it may either be from a) not very well supported format or b) musepack is such a complex/compressed format it is inevitable
2006-06-11T13:04:00.000Z	Warbo	Healot	Lossy
2006-06-11T13:04:00.000Z	Warbo	Healot	I think it is "open", but based on MP3 so it can't be technically
2006-06-11T13:05:00.000Z	Warbo	Healot	If it was lossless then I would simply convert to FLAC, but it is a bad idea to transcode lossy to lossy
2006-06-11T13:06:00.000Z	Healot	Warbo	I would guess it's the algorithm
2006-06-11T13:07:00.000Z	Warbo	Healot	Well I can speculate, but I was just curious about peaople's real-world experience with it. I may test it in XMMS, since that is more lightweight
2006-06-11T13:08:00.000Z	Warbo	Healot	It doesn't affect quality thankfully
2006-06-11T13:14:00.000Z	Warbo	Healot	Hmmm... XMMS seems to have no gap when changing tracks. In fact, it seems to change tracks 4 seconds before the song is over :(
2006-06-11T14:07:00.000Z	Healot	Warbo	it is still GPL'd
2006-06-11T14:07:00.000Z	Warbo	Healot	So installing it in VMWare has no restrictions or seperate licence issues?
