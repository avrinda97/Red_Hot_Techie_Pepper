2010-10-13T03:42:00.000Z	zebastianortis		when i click on it it says access denied
2010-10-13T03:42:00.000Z	zebastianortis		i want it to prompt and ask for a password instead
2010-10-13T03:43:00.000Z	zebastianortis		Error opening directory '/home/sebastian/Desktop/journal/$': Permission denied
2010-10-13T03:44:00.000Z	zebastianortis		instead of that i want a prompt that asks me for my password, much like with synaptic
2010-10-13T03:46:00.000Z	zebastianortis		i want the folder that only root can open to show up a prompt that asks for the password instead of saying access denied only root can open this folder
2010-10-13T03:46:00.000Z	zebastianortis		i made a folder that only root has permission to open, read write, etc, to put my journal in it, when i click on it from the gui though it says permission denied, i want it to pop up a prompt asking for apssword instead
2010-10-13T03:48:00.000Z	zebastianortis		for insttance when i open synaptic it prompts asking me for my password, what i want is exactly that to happen when i click on the folder that i created on which only root has read write privileges, currently it says access denied upon clicking, i want a prompt asking for password instead
2010-10-13T03:50:00.000Z	zebastianortis		there must be some algorithm that prompts for passwords
2010-10-13T03:50:00.000Z	zebastianortis		i am using pcmanfm, i am on lubuntu
2010-10-13T03:52:00.000Z	zebastianortis		aha, so is there a way that i can ask gksudo to open pcmanfm to open this folder?
2010-10-13T03:52:00.000Z	madfox	zebastianortis	you can make a simple wrapper to have gksudo call your filemanager
2010-10-13T03:52:00.000Z	zebastianortis	madfox	how?
2010-10-13T03:54:00.000Z	zebastianortis	madfox	how do you make a wrapper to do it?
2010-10-13T03:54:00.000Z	madfox	zebastianortis	Edit your menus and see what the command line args gksudu calls for synaptic and recreate it for pcman
2010-10-13T03:55:00.000Z	madfox	zebastianortis	basically play with it till it works.
2010-10-13T04:07:00.000Z	madfox	zebastianortis	why are you loging in as root?
2010-10-13T04:09:00.000Z	madfox	zebastianortis	we already told you. Make a wrapper with gksudo
2010-10-13T04:10:00.000Z	zebastianortis	madfox	how!?
2010-10-13T04:12:00.000Z	madfox	zebastianortis	muck around your menu configuration and look at how gksudo is used. Then make a new menu option that uses that for pcman.
2010-10-13T04:14:00.000Z	zebastianortis	madfox	ok how do i muck around my menu config?
2010-10-13T04:15:00.000Z	madfox	zebastianortis	not sure. In gnome its under my administration
2010-10-13T04:15:00.000Z	zebastianortis	madfox	what should i google for if i'm on lubuntu
2010-10-13T04:17:00.000Z	madfox	zebastianortis	I havnt used LXDE but you can try googling LXDE menu config and seeing what pops up
