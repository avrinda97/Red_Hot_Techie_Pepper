2006-04-19T09:47:00.000Z	skpl		so nobody can help me get my ftp server running?
2006-04-19T09:48:00.000Z	lone_marauder	skpl	just jumped in - what's wrong with it?
2006-04-19T09:49:00.000Z	skpl	lone_marauder	i have proftpd installed but i cannot connect to my machine via ftp, though i have added an ftp rule with firestarter
2006-04-19T09:49:00.000Z	lone_marauder	skpl	- when you say "connect", do you mean it doesn't even prompt you for a password?
2006-04-19T09:49:00.000Z	skpl	lone_marauder	i think i need to have inetd running but i do not know how to start it
2006-04-19T09:49:00.000Z	skpl	lone_marauder	i get connection refused
2006-04-19T09:49:00.000Z	lone_marauder	skpl	hang on a sec - let me look at something
2006-04-19T09:50:00.000Z	lone_marauder	skpl	OK - is the service running?
2006-04-19T09:50:00.000Z	skpl	lone_marauder	no...:(
2006-04-19T09:51:00.000Z	lone_marauder	skpl	cool.  looks like you're good to go.  Good luck.
2006-04-19T09:52:00.000Z	skpl	lone_marauder	but proftpd is supposed to be started by inetd automatically, right?
2006-04-19T09:53:00.000Z	lone_marauder	skpl	you're touching on old knowledge long buried.  To be honest, I can't remember the last thing I installed that uses inetd to start the service dynamically.
2006-04-19T09:53:00.000Z	skpl	lone_marauder	if i use the server in standalone mode will it still start up when i boot my machine?
2006-04-19T09:53:00.000Z	lone_marauder	skpl	I run several servers, but I don't remember the last time I had to mess with inetd.
2006-04-19T09:54:00.000Z	lone_marauder	skpl	the service needs to be assigned to the default runlevel.  Hang on.  Let me check something else.
2006-04-19T09:54:00.000Z	skpl	lone_marauder	ok i got the ftp server to accept a connection, but how do i make sure it runs at startup?
2006-04-19T09:55:00.000Z	lone_marauder	skpl	- I am looking at that now.
2006-04-19T09:55:00.000Z	lone_marauder	skpl	- I am a long time Gentoo user but am new to Ubuntu.
2006-04-19T09:56:00.000Z	lone_marauder	skpl	 if it is checked in services, it should start when you reboot.
2006-04-19T09:58:00.000Z	skpl	lone_marauder	what do you mean checked in services?
2006-04-19T09:59:00.000Z	lone_marauder	skpl	in the services list under system->administration->services
2006-04-19T09:59:00.000Z	skpl	lone_marauder	thank you!
2006-04-19T11:12:00.000Z	lone_marauder	skpl	wouldn't that be in /etc/fstab?
2006-04-19T11:13:00.000Z	skpl	lone_marauder	nevermind, i found it
