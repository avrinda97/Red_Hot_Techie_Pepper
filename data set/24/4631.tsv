2009-12-11T10:38:00.000Z	scunizi	Brandon	yeessss
2009-12-11T10:38:00.000Z	Brandon	scunizi	you seem to know about vmware and such...can you help me with my issue as well?
2009-12-11T10:38:00.000Z	scunizi	Brandon	I don't know..what's your issue?
2009-12-11T10:40:00.000Z	Brandon	scunizi	allow me to explain. I'm making a custom ubuntu live cd with vmware player installed. it has to be vmware player. not virtual box. I'm at the point of installing software following the live cd guide on the ubuntu website, but, I can't access the file from the shell I'm using as I chroot to the livecd mount I'm using to customize. if I open up another shell and run the installer,...
2009-12-11T10:41:00.000Z	Brandon	scunizi	I'm trying to find a repository with vmware player instead, but I can't find a repo with it. trying to use apt-get to install it to my livecd mount
2009-12-11T10:41:00.000Z	scunizi	Brandon	look in http://packages.ubuntu.com for the player package.. also you might accomplish what you want in one TTY that's chrooted by using "screen"
2009-12-11T10:42:00.000Z	Brandon	scunizi	explain that last part?
2009-12-11T10:43:00.000Z	scunizi	Brandon	screen is a terminal tty multiplexer.. it allows you to be in one terminal but create "virtual" terminals within the one you're in.. very cool..
2009-12-11T10:44:00.000Z	Brandon	scunizi	i'm not finding the player package
2009-12-11T10:44:00.000Z	scunizi	Brandon	which version of ubuntu?
2009-12-11T10:44:00.000Z	Brandon	scunizi	9.10
2009-12-11T10:45:00.000Z	scunizi	Brandon	I'm not either.. weird..
2009-12-11T10:47:00.000Z	Brandon	scunizi	if you could find a repo for me I'd greatly appreciate it.
2009-12-11T10:47:00.000Z	scunizi	Brandon	hang on.. looking
2009-12-11T10:49:00.000Z	scunizi	Brandon	found it on vmware's site.. it even mentions it works on 9.10 .. you have to register to get the download though.. https://www.vmware.com/tryvmware/?p=player&lp=1
2009-12-11T10:50:00.000Z	Brandon	scunizi	I knew that, but to get it on my livecd...
2009-12-11T10:50:00.000Z	Brandon	scunizi	I'm a complete linux newb..=/
2009-12-11T10:51:00.000Z	scunizi	Brandon	and you're attempting the harder stuff.. if you have enough ram you should be able to download and install in the livecd boot.
2009-12-11T10:51:00.000Z	Brandon	scunizi	but it has to be part of it
2009-12-11T10:51:00.000Z	scunizi	Brandon	so.. if it's installed isn't it part of it?
2009-12-11T10:53:00.000Z	Brandon	scunizi	if I installed it after booting from the live cd, it doesn't meet my requirements.
2009-12-11T10:53:00.000Z	scunizi	Brandon	this might be an issue that the folks over at #vmware might have an answer to..
2009-12-11T10:55:00.000Z	scunizi	Brandon	also ##linux might be a resource
