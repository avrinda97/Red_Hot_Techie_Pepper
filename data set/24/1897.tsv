2009-07-27T04:33:00.000Z	joh		Alright, I'm having serious issues with the live usb stick
2009-07-27T04:33:00.000Z	joh		For some reason it mounts my main harddisk read-only under /cdrom
2009-07-27T04:34:00.000Z	joh		And I'm unable to unmount it because it's busy
2009-07-27T04:34:00.000Z	h4f1	joh	try --force or something
2009-07-27T04:34:00.000Z	joh	h4f1	umount2: Device or resource busy
2009-07-27T04:34:00.000Z	joh	h4f1	It just won't unmount
2009-07-27T04:36:00.000Z	joh	h4f1	Yes, /dev/sda1 on /cdrom type ext4 (ro,noatime,barrier=1,data=ordered)
2009-07-27T04:36:00.000Z	joh	h4f1	Why on earth is it mounted as /cdrom?
2009-07-27T04:36:00.000Z	joh	h4f1	The usb stick is mounted as /media/live
2009-07-27T04:36:00.000Z	h4f1	joh	try eject
2009-07-27T04:37:00.000Z	joh	h4f1	It's not my cdrom that's mounted under /cdrom, it's my primary hard drive!
2009-07-27T04:37:00.000Z	joh	h4f1	For some reason, the usb live system mounted it under /cdrom without the option to unmount it
2009-07-27T04:38:00.000Z	joh	h4f1	this is a live usb stick, and I need to use it to rescue my main system
2009-07-27T04:38:00.000Z	joh	h4f1	But I can't do anything as long as my primary hard drive is mounted
2009-07-27T04:39:00.000Z	h4f1	joh	shouldn't be mounted to rescue ?
2009-07-27T04:39:00.000Z	joh	h4f1	No, you
2009-07-27T04:39:00.000Z	joh	h4f1	No, it shouldn't but for some reason the live cd mixes the devices up
2009-07-27T04:40:00.000Z	joh	h4f1	I think it believes that /dev/sda1 is the usb stick
2009-07-27T04:40:00.000Z	h4f1	joh	what exactly you want to rescue ?
2009-07-27T04:40:00.000Z	joh	h4f1	My primary hard-drive
2009-07-27T04:40:00.000Z	joh	h4f1	I need to run an fsck on it
2009-07-27T04:41:00.000Z	joh	h4f1	But I can't as long as the stupid live system has it mounted
2009-07-27T04:41:00.000Z	joh	h4f1	And I'm unable to mount it
2009-07-27T04:44:00.000Z	h4f1	joh	did you try umount with gparted ?
