2008-05-25T02:00:00.000Z	Carbonflux		I am talking about the Pulse audio server included in 8.04
2008-05-25T02:00:00.000Z	Carbonflux		I can't even play two audio sources at once anymore
2008-05-25T02:01:00.000Z	Carbonflux		I would like to remove it but it has a dependency to Ubuntu desktop
2008-05-25T02:02:00.000Z	Carbonflux		no one seems to care heh
2008-05-25T02:04:00.000Z	Carbonflux		so, most Ubuntu users don't use audio?
2008-05-25T02:04:00.000Z	Carbonflux		what I want to understand is why we needed this overkill network audio server for a desktop distro heh
2008-05-25T02:04:00.000Z	Carbonflux		and why its so hard to remove
2008-05-25T02:04:00.000Z	Carbonflux		why force this on everyone is what I don't get
2008-05-25T02:05:00.000Z	Carbonflux		ALSA worked great it seemed like
2008-05-25T02:05:00.000Z	Carbonflux		this is not about that linxeh
2008-05-25T02:05:00.000Z	tritium	Carbonflux	alsa is still used
2008-05-25T02:10:00.000Z	tritium	Carbonflux	why does everything you say include "heh"?
2008-05-25T02:11:00.000Z	Carbonflux	tritium	because I understand this is a FOSS channel and I want to be nice even tho I am deeply frustrated with pulse audio and the fact that for a few weeks now I have gotten no traction on it and that the issues are being ignored and for some reason the people deciding this stuff are forcing pulse audio on us and I don't want it or like it :)
2008-05-25T02:16:00.000Z	tritium	Carbonflux	it's just a meta-package.  It contains no actual files itself.  It's merely a list of dependencies.
2008-05-25T02:19:00.000Z	tritium	Carbonflux	it's safe, as we've explained
2008-05-25T02:22:00.000Z	tritium	Carbonflux	if you choose to dist-upgrade to a new release, you can reinstall it at that point.
2008-05-25T02:22:00.000Z	tritium	Carbonflux	and FYI, the major pulse audio fixes are already in intrepid
2008-05-25T02:23:00.000Z	tritium	Carbonflux	that's correct
2008-05-25T02:24:00.000Z	tritium	Carbonflux	there's nothing wrong with new releases, even though the old one will still be supported long term
2008-05-25T02:24:00.000Z	tritium	Carbonflux	yes, 8.04.1
2008-05-25T02:25:00.000Z	Carbonflux	tritium	so if I just wait it out it will stablize?
2008-05-25T02:26:00.000Z	tritium	Carbonflux	yes
2008-05-25T02:26:00.000Z	Carbonflux	tritium	thanks :)
2008-05-25T02:28:00.000Z	tritium	Carbonflux	if you're anxious, you might consider trying hardy-backports
