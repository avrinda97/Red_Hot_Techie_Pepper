2011-10-27T12:32:00.000Z	gorillanoananana		guys what's happening with the stupid ocelot? I just installed it on a friend's computer.. It's been a while since  i have not used ubuntu since i switcehed to debian which is more mercifull with my old 9 years old laptop
2011-10-27T12:32:00.000Z	gorillanoananana		i am trying to set a theme on ocelot and i just realized that whomever messed around whit the them choser was a good one..
2011-10-27T12:32:00.000Z	gorillanoananana		yeah got a question
2011-10-27T12:33:00.000Z	gorillanoananana		 the them chooser does not read /usr/share/themes
2011-10-27T12:33:00.000Z	gorillanoananana		i mean it does not read the full contents
2011-10-27T12:33:00.000Z	gorillanoananana		ikonia
2011-10-27T12:33:00.000Z	gorillanoananana		 my friend did not liked unity so i have instaled the gnome
2011-10-27T12:33:00.000Z	gorillanoananana		now..

2011-10-27T12:36:00.000Z	grendal-prime	gorillanoananana	what version of ubuntu are your triying to do this on?
2011-10-27T12:36:00.000Z	gorillanoananana	grendal-prime	 the latest and the greatest
2011-10-27T12:38:00.000Z	grendal-prime	gorillanoananana	what exactly do you want to do?
2011-10-27T12:51:00.000Z	gorillanoananana	grendal-prime	 because they are targeting the tablet market.. that's why..
2011-10-27T12:53:00.000Z	grendal-prime	gorillanoananana	is there just a gnome package?
2011-10-27T12:54:00.000Z	gorillanoananana	grendal-prime	 what do you mean?
2011-10-27T12:58:00.000Z	gorillanoananana	grendal-prime	 if you look carefull at the screenshots you will see that i have installed this ubuntu for my friend on  a mac
2011-10-27T13:00:00.000Z	grendal-prime	gorillanoananana	in that situation especiallialy i would go with lts 64 bit
2011-10-27T13:01:00.000Z	grendal-prime	gorillanoananana	in lts 64 bit no..and dude ive seen that run on  a mac 4 of them actually it works fine
2011-10-27T13:02:00.000Z	grendal-prime	gorillanoananana	will your friend want to do any virtulization..(ie wondows)
2011-10-27T13:03:00.000Z	grendal-prime	gorillanoananana	ya but there is always something that reguires a vm
2011-10-27T13:05:00.000Z	grendal-prime	gorillanoananana	i do not want to misslead you...in any way.. i do know the lts uses gnome just fine for now
2011-10-27T13:07:00.000Z	grendal-prime	gorillanoananana	do you want gnome to work on that machine?
2011-10-27T13:08:00.000Z	gorillanoananana	grendal-prime	 yes
