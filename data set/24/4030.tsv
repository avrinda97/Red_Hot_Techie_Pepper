2007-10-22T04:54:00.000Z	keen		how do you change the active partition with ubuntu?
2007-10-22T04:55:00.000Z	keen		pelo, my hdd is broken up into 3 partitions, i need to make another partition the active one, but i have no idea how to do that in ubuntu
2007-10-22T04:55:00.000Z	cwillu	keen	cfdisk
2007-10-22T04:55:00.000Z	cwillu	keen	sudo cfdisk, actually
2007-10-22T04:55:00.000Z	cwillu	keen	but be careful
2007-10-22T04:57:00.000Z	cwillu	keen	sudo cfdisk
2007-10-22T04:57:00.000Z	keen	cwillu	is there anymore to that command, cfdisk?
2007-10-22T04:57:00.000Z	cwillu	keen	it's a terminal mode graphical thingy
2007-10-22T04:57:00.000Z	keen	cwillu	because it doesn't do anything for me
2007-10-22T04:57:00.000Z	keen	cwillu	hehe nm, missed typed it
2007-10-22T04:58:00.000Z	keen	cwillu	the partition i want to boot has the "bootable" flag by it, but the grub bootloader still starts first, any ideas?
2007-10-22T04:59:00.000Z	cwillu	keen	grub is probably installed to (hd0) rather than (hd0,0);  not quite sure what you'd need to get darwin to override it
2007-10-22T05:00:00.000Z	keen	cwillu	well basically i can't boot macos, i have no option in grub and thought it would be easier to use darwin since its already set up instead of adding entries to grubb
2007-10-22T05:02:00.000Z	keen	cwillu	any ideas?
2007-10-22T05:03:00.000Z	cwillu	keen	honestly, it'd be easier for me to troubleshoot grub (not much mac experience)
2007-10-22T05:03:00.000Z	cwillu	keen	anything show up if you google it?
2007-10-22T05:03:00.000Z	keen	cwillu	hehe not really...i'm running mac os on my dell soooo there isn't really much info out there
2007-10-22T05:04:00.000Z	keen	cwillu	all i really wanna do is make darwin by my primary bootloader
2007-10-22T05:06:00.000Z	cwillu	keen	grub-install "(hd0,0)" might work (hd0,0) meaning the first drive, first partition, which probably isn't right in your case
2007-10-22T05:07:00.000Z	cwillu	keen	but I have no experience with the darwin bootloader
2007-10-22T05:07:00.000Z	keen	cwillu	well thanks for the help, i know that darwin is on hd0,3
2007-10-22T05:07:00.000Z	cwillu	keen	that grub line was to move the ubuntu bootloader
2007-10-22T05:09:00.000Z	cwillu	keen	http://forum.insanelymac.com/lofiversion/index.php/t3195.html might be useful
2007-10-22T05:09:00.000Z	keen	cwillu	thanks much
