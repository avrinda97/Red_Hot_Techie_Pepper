2009-09-20T03:39:00.000Z	hari_		I have asked this before, but is it possible to install Ubuntu and then "not" use Gnome? I don't want a "desktop environment", just a window manager and some basic tools .. is that possible? Are there instructions anywhere?
2009-09-20T03:39:00.000Z	vovk	hari_	of course it is
2009-09-20T03:39:00.000Z	vovk	hari_	use apt to get rid of all of gnome
2009-09-20T03:40:00.000Z	vovk	hari_	xfce is a nice window manager, if you want something lighter weight, fluxbox, openbox, icewm, awesome, and several others are open
2009-09-20T03:40:00.000Z	hari_	vovk	 I don't want to "remove" Gnome either, just not start it up because there are lots of other services that start up, and applications
2009-09-20T03:40:00.000Z	vovk	hari_	a tip though. keep the gnome libraries and gdm ;) they'll make your life easier
2009-09-20T03:41:00.000Z	hari_	vovk	Exactly. gnome libraries, I will keep
2009-09-20T03:41:00.000Z	vovk	hari_	then install another window manager and set it as default in gdm :)
2009-09-20T03:41:00.000Z	vovk	hari_	gdm is your "login page" i suppose, but it does much more than that
2009-09-20T03:41:00.000Z	hari_	vovk	actually i didn't want gdm either, i wanted to boot up to a terminal and do a startx
2009-09-20T03:41:00.000Z	vovk	hari_	aah. ok then
2009-09-20T03:41:00.000Z	vovk	hari_	then just put the window manager start command in ~/.xinitrc
2009-09-20T03:41:00.000Z	hari_	vovk	old school style, kind of. But you get my point
2009-09-20T03:42:00.000Z	vovk	hari_	yeah, i can help you with that if you like :D ~/.xinitrc is run every time you startx
2009-09-20T03:42:00.000Z	vovk	hari_	no need to get rid of ubuntu, but you will have to research how to stop gdm from starting
2009-09-20T03:42:00.000Z	hari_	vovk	i believe gdm is a service in /etc/init.d and I can remove that using sysv-rc-conf or BUM or something
2009-09-20T03:43:00.000Z	vovk	hari_	not in my ubuntu box right now so i can't tell... it might be gdm is actually in your /etc/rc3.d
2009-09-20T03:43:00.000Z	hari_	vovk	all right, i will look up this ~/.xinitrc config file and learn how to go about it. Thanks :)
2009-09-20T03:43:00.000Z	vovk	hari_	.xinitrc is easy to understand
2009-09-20T03:43:00.000Z	vovk	hari_	i just dunno how to turn off gdm
2009-09-20T03:44:00.000Z	vovk	hari_	for instance, if i wanted fluxbox to start when i ran startx, in my xinitrc i would write "startfluxbox" (the command to start fluxbox)
2009-09-20T03:44:00.000Z	hari_	vovk	ok so basically each window manager has its own command to "start" it .. which I guess I would know by reading or familiarizing myself with the window manager documentation?
2009-09-20T03:45:00.000Z	vovk	hari_	yeah, "man WM_NAME" would tell you
2009-09-20T03:45:00.000Z	hari_	vovk	alright cool will try :)
