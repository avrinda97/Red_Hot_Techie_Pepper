2005-04-12T13:55:00.000Z	Keizer		I want to make an uber box with a cube case
2005-04-12T13:57:00.000Z	Keizer		After you reboot your computer you'll have to do it again
2005-04-12T13:57:00.000Z	Keizer		Unless
2005-04-12T13:57:00.000Z	Keizer		You select your output plugin to be eSound
2005-04-12T13:58:00.000Z	Keizer		If your output plugin is set for eSound theoretically it would work.
2005-04-12T13:58:00.000Z	Keizer		LOL
2005-04-12T13:59:00.000Z	Keizer		I recommend Beep-Media-Player to everyone
2005-04-12T14:00:00.000Z	Keizer		It's a sweet player that supports Winamp skins
2005-04-12T14:00:00.000Z	Keizer		It's awesome
2005-04-12T14:00:00.000Z	thoreauputic_	Keizer	I liked it at first - but I find xmms more reliable here
2005-04-12T14:01:00.000Z	Keizer	thoreauputic_	too bad, beep-media-player is a champ on my 1.6Ghz 256MB RAM box.
2005-04-12T14:02:00.000Z	thoreauputic_	Keizer	yes, it's odd - beep tends to freeze where xmms doesn't - haven't found the problem yet
2005-04-12T14:03:00.000Z	Keizer	thoreauputic_	beep-media-player is awesome
2005-04-12T14:04:00.000Z	thoreauputic_	Keizer	so everyone says - to me it looks just like xmms except for the menus
2005-04-12T14:04:00.000Z	thoreauputic_	Keizer	it even uses the same skins
2005-04-12T14:05:00.000Z	thoreauputic_	Keizer	I must have missed omething
2005-04-12T14:05:00.000Z	Keizer	thoreauputic_	It's the pwn
2005-04-12T14:05:00.000Z	thoreauputic_	Keizer	why? What's so much better about it?
2005-04-12T14:06:00.000Z	Keizer	thoreauputic_	It's awesome, supports Winamp skins
2005-04-12T14:06:00.000Z	thoreauputic_	Keizer	so does xmms
2005-04-12T14:06:00.000Z	thoreauputic_	Keizer	it sounds the same :-)
2005-04-12T14:07:00.000Z	thoreauputic_	Keizer	which is the test for a sound app, No?
2005-04-12T14:07:00.000Z	Keizer	thoreauputic_	I only use BMP now.
