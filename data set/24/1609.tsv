2012-02-27T12:18:00.000Z	freshone0		and it worked fine but my maid shut the pc suddenly so all sound vanished

2012-02-27T12:19:00.000Z	freshone0		no

2012-02-27T12:20:00.000Z	Blue1	freshone0	did the alsa mixer show anything muted, or at zero?
2012-02-27T12:10:00.000Z	Blue1	freshone0	 System/Administration/System Testing
2012-02-27T12:11:00.000Z	Blue1	freshone0	huh?
2012-02-27T12:12:00.000Z	Blue1	freshone0	try lspci | grep Audio
2012-02-27T12:14:00.000Z	Blue1	freshone0	ah good linux at least sees it
2012-02-27T12:14:00.000Z	Blue1	freshone0	yeah no worry about that just highlighed the word
2012-02-27T12:15:00.000Z	Blue1	freshone0	have you looked at the alsa-mixer
2012-02-27T12:15:00.000Z	Blue1	freshone0	or alsamixer
2012-02-27T12:16:00.000Z	Blue1	freshone0	yes
2012-02-27T12:17:00.000Z	Blue1	freshone0	was that a clean install, or an upgrade?
2012-02-27T12:17:00.000Z	Blue1	freshone0	that may be the problem - upgrades are problematic at best --
2012-02-27T12:18:00.000Z	Blue1	freshone0	consider backing up /etc/ and /home/   and then doing a clean install
2012-02-27T12:18:00.000Z	Blue1	freshone0	see above
2012-02-27T12:22:00.000Z	Blue1	freshone0	should show green/white/red
