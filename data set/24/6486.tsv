2005-10-09T07:32:00.000Z	GDorn		is it pronounced "free enn ecks" or "freenks"?
2005-10-09T07:32:00.000Z	p0windah	GDorn	you're back, did you get it going ?
2005-10-09T07:32:00.000Z	GDorn	p0windah	 working on it now, building it from source
2005-10-09T07:33:00.000Z	p0windah	GDorn	building from source.... not necessary methinks with hoary/breezy
2005-10-09T07:33:00.000Z	GDorn	p0windah	 oh.  I didn't see a package...
2005-10-09T07:33:00.000Z	p0windah	GDorn	you running hoary or breezy ?
2005-10-09T07:34:00.000Z	p0windah	GDorn	I dont recall the repos. I used for hoary, but there is one referenced somewhere in the forums
2005-10-09T07:35:00.000Z	p0windah	GDorn	the breezy repos. is seveas.ubuntulinux.nl
2005-10-09T07:37:00.000Z	p0windah	GDorn	there you go, both hoary and breezy packages are in his repos.
2005-10-09T07:53:00.000Z	p0windah	GDorn	you use the packaged deb's or did you roll your own from source ?
2005-10-09T07:53:00.000Z	GDorn	p0windah	 I went with the packages from that repo.
2005-10-09T07:54:00.000Z	p0windah	GDorn	ah ok, when it was setting up, did you choose "no machine keys" ?
2005-10-09T07:54:00.000Z	GDorn	p0windah	 I think I goofed and told it manual install...
2005-10-09T07:54:00.000Z	p0windah	GDorn	dpkg-reconfigure freenx
2005-10-09T07:55:00.000Z	p0windah	GDorn	:)
2005-10-09T07:55:00.000Z	p0windah	GDorn	oh man, you are in for a sweet ride my friend
2005-10-09T07:59:00.000Z	p0windah	GDorn	close the client and a popup should appear, choose "suspend"
2005-10-09T08:00:00.000Z	p0windah	GDorn	once it closes, fire up the client again and you can reconnect or start a new session
2005-10-09T08:20:00.000Z	p0windah	GDorn	??
2005-10-09T08:21:00.000Z	p0windah	GDorn	open a terminal and "nxserver --list", you might need to "nxserver --terminate :1001"
2005-10-09T08:24:00.000Z	GDorn	p0windah	yeah, that just killed the session I had started.  it was connecting and starting x, but then not starting gnome.  dunno why.  trying a reboot, just to be sure.
2005-10-10T07:22:00.000Z	p0windah	GDorn	hey, how'd you go with freenx ?
2005-10-10T07:23:00.000Z	GDorn	p0windah	 not so good.  it works, but it doesn't really do what I need it to. it can't convert a local session to a remote session or vice versa
2005-10-10T07:24:00.000Z	p0windah	GDorn	ah ok, not sure if thats in the pipelines
