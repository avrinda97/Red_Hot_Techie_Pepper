2011-01-24T22:43:00.000Z	cache_surplus		also, the factoids point to things on the ubuntu site, wouldnt that be approved through a diff set up people than chat ops?
2011-01-24T22:45:00.000Z	cache_surplus		actually im talking about editing the actual ubuntu info, not the factoid listing title thingy
2011-01-24T22:46:00.000Z	Pici	cache_surplus	I'll go with the standard 'Its a wiki' reply.
2011-01-24T22:46:00.000Z	cache_surplus	Pici	factoids are links that point to info on ubuntu help. correct?
2011-01-24T22:47:00.000Z	cache_surplus		i wish to edit the info on ubuntu's site only. how do i go about that?
2011-01-24T22:48:00.000Z	cache_surplus		ic. i have an account, so i should just start editing and then someone will approve, correct?
