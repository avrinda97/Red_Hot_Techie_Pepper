2005-09-21T10:50:00.000Z	ribbo		hi, just booted my Desktop machine (running Hoary_64). during boot says that it cannot access hardware clock... (Hmm, OK I thought)
2005-09-21T10:50:00.000Z	ribbo		Now I cannot log in either, does not accept my password
2005-09-21T10:50:00.000Z	ribbo		is the bios clock used somehow when hashing a password?
2005-09-21T10:51:00.000Z	GoClick	ribbo	well time changes so getting the same hash again would be impossible
2005-09-21T10:52:00.000Z	GoClick	ribbo	which password[s]  are you wondering about?
2005-09-21T10:52:00.000Z	ribbo	GoClick	My login to the machine
2005-09-21T10:54:00.000Z	GoClick	ribbo	most hashing methods do not produce a blank hash for a blank input and many will use a salt sometimes based on the username so two users with the same password will have a different hash
2005-09-21T10:54:00.000Z	GoClick	ribbo	is the issue you forgot your password?
2005-09-21T10:55:00.000Z	ribbo	GoClick	forgot password? No
2005-09-21T10:55:00.000Z	ribbo	GoClick	good thing I made a backup then
2005-09-21T10:55:00.000Z	ribbo	GoClick	via Knoppix
2005-09-21T10:56:00.000Z	GoClick	ribbo	are you sure you weren't editing the knoppix pass file?
2005-09-21T10:56:00.000Z	ribbo	GoClick	yes I am
2005-09-21T10:58:00.000Z	GoClick	ribbo	perhaps Ubuntu and Knoppix use different hashing algs
2005-09-21T10:58:00.000Z	ribbo	GoClick	true
2005-09-21T10:59:00.000Z	GoClick	ribbo	did you try and make a user on knoppix and copy the line to your other file?
2005-09-21T10:59:00.000Z	GoClick	ribbo	I think it'd be better use use a Ubuntu Live CD for this rather than Knoppix if you can
2005-09-21T10:59:00.000Z	ribbo	GoClick	not yet
2005-09-21T11:00:00.000Z	GoClick	ribbo	can we dcc?
2005-09-21T11:00:00.000Z	ribbo	GoClick	gotcha! But does md5hash use the hardware clock when it hashes a password...just seems strange that both issues occur at the same time
2005-09-21T11:02:00.000Z	ribbo	GoClick	hat I am trying to say does the algorhythm(sp) use clock cycles to generate the hash
2005-09-21T11:03:00.000Z	GoClick	ribbo	NO it does NOT use the clock
2005-09-21T11:03:00.000Z	ribbo	GoClick	thanks
2005-09-21T11:04:00.000Z	GoClick	ribbo	md5 is for making a hash that is reproducable same input will always make the same output and clock cycles wouldn't be very good because then the passwords would bever work
