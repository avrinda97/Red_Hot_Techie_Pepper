2009-07-25T04:43:00.000Z	elbuo		yes i install from usb to HDD and when it passes grub it loads for a few secs then throws me some errorrs about the kernel
2009-07-25T04:43:00.000Z	DasEi	elbuo	what errors ?
2009-07-25T04:45:00.000Z	DasEi	elbuo	if you just use the installer cd and install to usbhd, maybe even disconnect internal drives won't work ?
2009-07-25T04:47:00.000Z	DasEi	elbuo	please put in nick, if talking to me, else I loose your message; why should hd be screwed ?
2009-07-25T04:49:00.000Z	DasEi	elbuo	no need for pm, just start line with nick (without '!'), see:
2009-07-25T04:50:00.000Z	elbuo	DasEi	well i dont know do you have any suggestions?
2009-07-25T04:50:00.000Z	DasEi	elbuo	why do you think hd is broken ?
2009-07-25T04:52:00.000Z	elbuo	DasEi	because it was given to me if i could fix it cuz wincrap wouldnt load...so i tried xp, vista and 7 and none could write in the HDD, then i isntelled linux and it worked so i thought i could give him dual boot. when i was running gparted light went out and the laptop turned off eventually without completing and since then my problems sttarted
2009-07-25T04:53:00.000Z	DasEi	elbuo	I see, do you have a live cd handy and the drive around ?
2009-07-25T04:55:00.000Z	elbuo	DasEi	yes i have a live cd with no errors...scanned in 2 differents laptos
2009-07-25T04:55:00.000Z	DasEi	elbuo	: attach the usb-hd then and boot into live, call the messenger there and come back here
2009-07-25T04:56:00.000Z	elbuo	DasEi	im currently running another install from usb...75% atm
2009-07-25T04:56:00.000Z	DasEi	elbuo	still a port free for the other usb ?
2009-07-25T04:57:00.000Z	elbuo	DasEi	 im installing into the laptop's HDD from 1 usb yeah and i have 2 more usb ports available to use
2009-07-25T04:57:00.000Z	DasEi	elbuo	so attach the 'broken' drive...
2009-07-25T04:58:00.000Z	elbuo	DasEi	:S the one i think is broken is the HDD of the laptop not the usb-hd...
2009-07-25T04:58:00.000Z	DasEi	elbuo	the one youi're on now ?
2009-07-25T04:59:00.000Z	elbuo	DasEi	nop i have it just right here with me but its not this one
2009-07-25T05:02:00.000Z	DasEi	elbuo	so you want a fix for a not available drive ?
2009-07-25T05:03:00.000Z	elbuo	DasEi	it is available, it installs completely and confirms and everything, reboots and when i change to boot from HDD in the laptop it starts giving me ugly messages about the kernel trying to kill the unit
2009-07-25T05:05:00.000Z	DasEi	elbuo	if you set the lap to boot first from cd, then fro hd, don't have to change bios, just remove cd (and disablecd if you want), so it should work; else without checks these request becomes too speculative, you should access the system it's going about and then connect to here again
2009-07-25T05:11:00.000Z	elbuo	DasEi	install suddendly stoped
2009-07-25T05:11:00.000Z	elbuo	DasEi	ill be back later i have to go
2009-07-25T05:11:00.000Z	elbuo	DasEi	thanks
