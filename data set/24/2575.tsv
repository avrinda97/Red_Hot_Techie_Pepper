2008-11-03T15:52:00.000Z	Arendtsen		A 8.04 upgraded to 8.10. And now the network manager can't connect to any network at all
2008-11-03T15:52:00.000Z	Arendtsen		any ideas what to do?
2008-11-03T15:53:00.000Z	bazhang	Arendtsen	open a terminal and type ifconfig how many listings are there
2008-11-03T15:53:00.000Z	bazhang	Arendtsen	are you trying to connect to wired or wireless
2008-11-03T15:53:00.000Z	Arendtsen	bazhang	lo eth0 wlan0 wmaster0
2008-11-03T15:54:00.000Z	Arendtsen	bazhang	both wireless and wired
2008-11-03T15:54:00.000Z	bazhang	Arendtsen	sudo dhclient eth0 for wired
2008-11-03T15:54:00.000Z	Arendtsen	bazhang	that works
2008-11-03T15:54:00.000Z	bazhang	Arendtsen	do you have an open wifi hotspot (not encrypted)
2008-11-03T15:54:00.000Z	Arendtsen	bazhang	yup
2008-11-03T15:55:00.000Z	bazhang	Arendtsen	if so then sudo dhclient wlan0
2008-11-03T15:55:00.000Z	Arendtsen	bazhang	tried that as well... even tried to force it to use the correct ap and ssid though iwconfig
2008-11-03T15:56:00.000Z	bazhang	Arendtsen	you need to associate the card with the AP
2008-11-03T15:56:00.000Z	Arendtsen	bazhang	iwconfig wlan0 ap any works
2008-11-03T15:58:00.000Z	bazhang	Arendtsen	check that the essid is not hidden; I tend to use the command line as it is more reliable
2008-11-03T15:58:00.000Z	bazhang	Arendtsen	though is this with hardy or ibex
2008-11-03T15:59:00.000Z	Arendtsen	bazhang	I have a wife that needs to use it as well... so the GUI have to work since she is used to windows
2008-11-03T16:01:00.000Z	bazhang	Arendtsen	if this is ibex it may be a bug
2008-11-03T16:03:00.000Z	Arendtsen	bazhang	8.10... can't remember the name :)
2008-11-03T16:04:00.000Z	bazhang	Arendtsen	yup that is intrepid ibex
2008-11-03T16:05:00.000Z	Arendtsen	bazhang	thought so... Okay...
2008-11-03T16:22:00.000Z	bazhang	Arendtsen	aha nice going
2008-11-03T16:23:00.000Z	Arendtsen	bazhang	well... dpkg --list does show usefull things :)
2008-11-03T16:24:00.000Z	Arendtsen	bazhang	but thanks for you input :)
