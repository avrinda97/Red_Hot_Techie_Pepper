2012-07-24T22:11:00.000Z	inline6power		http://pastebin.com/BBMVViUQ
2012-07-24T22:12:00.000Z	inline6power		it keeps telling me i am using the wrong version of java but it will not let me uninstall my current verison
2012-07-24T22:12:00.000Z	inline6power		nor install the right version
2012-07-24T22:13:00.000Z	kyle__	inline6power	Change your default java.  it's doen with update-alternatives.
2012-07-24T22:13:00.000Z	kyle__	inline6power	Scroll down to the update-alternatives bits https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java
2012-07-24T22:13:00.000Z	kyle__	inline6power	Good luck.
2012-07-24T22:15:00.000Z	inline6power	kyle__	this is what it gives me http://paste.ubuntu.com/1108678/
2012-07-24T22:16:00.000Z	kyle__	inline6power	Does it want oracle java or something?  I've never built android, just installed the sdk.
2012-07-24T22:19:00.000Z	inline6power	kyle__	this is the error i am getting http://paste.ubuntu.com/1108683/
2012-07-24T22:20:00.000Z	kyle__	inline6power	Try installing the oracle jdk.  It's a tarball, you can put it opt or whever you like.  Then run the update-alternatives to point all the java goodness at it.
2012-07-24T22:20:00.000Z	kyle__	inline6power	But that's just a guess, iv'e not done what you're doing before.
2012-07-24T22:24:00.000Z	inline6power	kyle__	when i run sudo apt-get update this is what it tells me http://paste.ubuntu.com/1108693/
2012-07-24T22:26:00.000Z	kyle__	inline6power	pastebin your sources.list  maybe this is the whole root of the problem?
2012-07-24T22:33:00.000Z	inline6power	kyle__	here is my pastebin of sources.list http://paste.ubuntu.com/1108709/
2012-07-24T22:35:00.000Z	kyle__	inline6power	ummm.
2012-07-24T22:35:00.000Z	kyle__	inline6power	Those last two lines, did you add those?
2012-07-24T22:35:00.000Z	kyle__	inline6power	Because I think they kindof could completely be the problem (at least with your apt)
2012-07-24T22:36:00.000Z	inline6power	kyle__	 i am not sure if i did or not
2012-07-24T22:37:00.000Z	kyle__	inline6power	# works as a comment in that file,   Just give that a try.
2012-07-24T22:39:00.000Z	inline6power	kyle__	http://paste.ubuntu.com/1108720/ how do i remove the underscore from my java version? i think that may be my problem
2012-07-24T22:40:00.000Z	kyle__	inline6power	I dont' think you can.  Where did you get the build script?  Maybe they have a forum that can help with that prt of it?  Maybe it needs to go under the knife (vim/emacs/nano)?
2012-07-24T22:56:00.000Z	inline6power	kyle__	you were right. those last 2 sources were the problem. thanks a bunch man
