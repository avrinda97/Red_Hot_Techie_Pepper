2008-01-09T06:02:00.000Z	th0r	yahoo354	to get back the gnome login screen change the file /etc/X11/default-display-manager. Change /usr/bin/kdm to /usr/sbin/gdm
2008-01-09T06:03:00.000Z	yahoo354	th0r	sorry i dont know what do u mean
2008-01-09T06:03:00.000Z	th0r	yahoo354	have you logged out and back in after removing the package? and when you logged back in, did you change the Session to 'gnome'?
2008-01-09T06:04:00.000Z	yahoo354	th0r	yes i have also reset the system 10 times
2008-01-09T06:05:00.000Z	yahoo354	th0r	and also all the time change the session to gnome but still have most of kubuntu application in gnome
2008-01-09T06:06:00.000Z	yahoo354	th0r	any idea ?
2008-01-09T06:07:00.000Z	th0r	yahoo354	not really. I agree with Jack that removing the meta package should have removed all the kde stuff
2008-01-09T06:07:00.000Z	th0r	yahoo354	I would go into synaptic and remove all the kde packages that are marked installed
2008-01-09T06:07:00.000Z	yahoo354	th0r	ok thanks
2008-01-09T06:08:00.000Z	yahoo354	th0r	just type kde in synoptic ?
2008-01-09T06:08:00.000Z	th0r	yahoo354	just a sec
2008-01-09T06:09:00.000Z	th0r	yahoo354	on the left side of synaptic is a window where you can choose thekde desktop, then view what is instlaled on the right side
2008-01-09T06:10:00.000Z	yahoo354	th0r	any thing relate with it unistalled?
2008-01-09T06:11:00.000Z	th0r	yahoo354	yes...if you want to get rid of kde completely uninstall anything that is still marked installed
2008-01-09T06:11:00.000Z	yahoo354	th0r	thanks a lot let me do it and i tell you the result
2008-01-09T06:29:00.000Z	yahoo354	th0r	thanks a lot it work
2008-01-09T06:29:00.000Z	th0r	yahoo354	glad to hear it...
2008-01-09T06:30:00.000Z	yahoo354	th0r	just a question because it work and delect every kde staf but some of the icon are still in app which the do not work but they icon are there is there any way to destroy them as weel
2008-01-09T06:31:00.000Z	th0r	yahoo354	yes...I know how to find the .desktop files and move or delete them...but it isn't easy as they are spread all over the place. menus in gnome and kde are a disaster...that is one reason I use xfce
2008-01-09T06:32:00.000Z	yahoo354	th0r	any way thank a lot for ur help
2008-01-09T06:32:00.000Z	yahoo354	th0r	btw what is xface is it better than that gnome and...?
2008-01-09T06:34:00.000Z	th0r	yahoo354	xfce is lighter than gnome or kde...it will take less disk space, less memory, and run faster. But it isn't as 'fancy'. But I am a control freak and it allows me total control (like the menus)
2008-01-09T06:34:00.000Z	th0r	yahoo354	you can install xfce and not lose gnome...install all the xfce packages and install thunar. Then log out and when you log in again choose xfce from the Sessions menu
2008-01-09T06:35:00.000Z	yahoo354	th0r	thanks again you saved me and bye
