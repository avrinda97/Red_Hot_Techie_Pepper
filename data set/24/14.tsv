2004-10-03T09:42:00.000Z	rapha		Another stupid question, how do you install a .deb manually?
2004-10-03T09:44:00.000Z	rapha		Thabks sladen 
2004-10-03T09:45:00.000Z	rapha		I'm asking because I'm on RedHat right now; does Ubuntu have gcc and the other development tools installed by default?
2004-10-03T09:46:00.000Z	jdub	rapha	no, but they're on the CD
2004-10-03T09:48:00.000Z	rapha	jdub	Btw, nice seeing you here doing this Ubuntu stuff!
2004-10-03T09:51:00.000Z	jdub	rapha	:-)
2004-10-03T09:51:00.000Z	jdub	rapha	hope you enjoy it
2004-10-03T09:51:00.000Z	rapha	jdub	Installed it yesterday, but already am. But tell us the truth, you only want Mark to get you a trip into space, right?
2004-10-03T09:52:00.000Z	jdub	rapha	you do know we're all here on ISS, don't you?
2004-10-03T09:54:00.000Z	rapha	jdub	Oh. But naaah, I'm gonna make my own distro and it's gonna be based on Mars!
2004-10-25T16:19:00.000Z	rapha	jdub	Did you make the pics?
2004-10-25T16:20:00.000Z	jdub	rapha	no, a design company made them to spec for us
2004-10-25T16:20:00.000Z	rapha	jdub	I see
2004-10-25T16:20:00.000Z	rapha	jdub	Are you in the process of deciding for one?
2004-10-25T16:21:00.000Z	jdub	rapha	hrm?
2004-10-25T16:21:00.000Z	rapha	jdub	Are you in the process of choosing a design company to do the final Ubuntu artwork?
2004-10-25T16:22:00.000Z	jdub	rapha	no, this is the final artwork for WartyWarthog. it's our release candidate!
2004-10-25T16:23:00.000Z	rapha	jdub	Oh, I see! Cool.
2004-10-25T16:23:00.000Z	rapha	jdub	One thing Ubuntu is certainly doing is being noticed :)
2004-12-07T07:44:00.000Z	rapha	jdub	When I ordered those CDs I didn't know so many Windows users around here were interested in Ubuntu, so I only ordered 25. Will there be such a CD ordering programme for Hoary again?
2005-03-21T09:59:00.000Z	rapha	jdub	Do you by any chance know if there's a list online somewhere with all kernel patches that Ubuntu applied in Warty?
2005-03-21T10:01:00.000Z	jdub	rapha	in the linux source package? :)
2005-03-21T10:02:00.000Z	rapha	jdub	Well, I'd been hoping for just a list, not the actual patches themselves :-D
2005-03-21T11:40:00.000Z	jdub	rapha	mplayer can...
