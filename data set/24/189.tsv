2012-03-29T11:51:00.000Z	anthropos		what kind of drive is it
2012-03-29T11:51:00.000Z	anthropos		sorry, I was speaking to zandt
2012-03-29T11:52:00.000Z	zandt	anthropos	not really sure, it's from '98 though, so whatever was being used around that time
2012-03-29T11:55:00.000Z	zandt	anthropos	I'll give it a try. I dunno. doesn't sound good
2012-03-29T11:55:00.000Z	anthropos	zandt	did you back up your data?
2012-03-29T11:56:00.000Z	zandt	anthropos	nope :(
2012-03-29T11:57:00.000Z	zandt	anthropos	installing it, it didn't come on the liveusb I'm using
2012-03-29T12:11:00.000Z	zandt	anthropos	should I run short/extended/or conveyance self-test? (gsmartcontrol) (am I even @ the right spot heh)
2012-03-29T12:12:00.000Z	anthropos	zandt	I would look at the SMART data that it saves automatically first, then do short, then do extended. but i'm not an expert at hard disk recovery or anything
2012-03-29T12:12:00.000Z	zandt	anthropos	okay. *pretends to understand what he's reading*
2012-03-29T12:19:00.000Z	zandt	anthropos	Jordan_U, nothing is screaming @ me in the error log that it already has, but I can't make sense of it either. would it be okay I pasteb'd it ?
2012-03-29T12:20:00.000Z	anthropos	zandt	yes please pastebin it
2012-03-29T12:21:00.000Z	zandt	anthropos	http://pastebin.com/aCfA0vcn it's not terribly long. maybe it make sense to you
2012-03-29T12:22:00.000Z	anthropos	zandt	there should also be a spreadsheet like summary, do you see it
2012-03-29T12:24:00.000Z	zandt	anthropos	yeah
2012-03-29T12:24:00.000Z	anthropos	zandt	are any of the rows red, and are any sectors reallocated
2012-03-29T12:25:00.000Z	anthropos	zandt	there are defnitely some errors logged but it's hard to see if they are a catastrophe or not
2012-03-29T12:31:00.000Z	zandt	anthropos	test result: completed without error.
2012-03-29T12:31:00.000Z	anthropos	zandt	start the long one if you have about an hour to spare
2012-03-29T12:54:00.000Z	zandt	anthropos	apologies... liveusb crashed. need to reinstall gsmartcontrol. are you leaving ?
2012-03-29T13:11:00.000Z	zandt	anthropos	completed without error..
2012-03-29T13:12:00.000Z	anthropos	zandt	i suppose thats good but it doesn't nec. mean the drive is safe
2012-03-29T13:14:00.000Z	zandt	anthropos	I think I'm going to call it a night and try to bug some more people tomorrow
2012-03-29T13:15:00.000Z	anthropos	zandt	sounds good. dont trust the drive with your data
