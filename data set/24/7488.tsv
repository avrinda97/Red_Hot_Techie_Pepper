2004-11-06T14:14:00.000Z	unperson		Hi.  I just read about Ubuntu.  It sounds like a pretty cool project.  I've been using Debian testing for a while and I'm pretty happy with it, but I've felt that packages don't always work together as smoothly on the desktop as you would like.
2004-11-06T14:14:00.000Z	unperson		So I've often wished someone would put together and configure a set of them that just work, and it looks like that's what Ubuntu kind of does.
2004-11-06T14:14:00.000Z	funkytwig	unperson	give us a for example
2004-11-06T14:16:00.000Z	funkytwig	unperson	thats the general idea ;)
2004-11-06T14:16:00.000Z	unperson	funkytwig	Well, for example, getting a web browser mailto link to open a tab in an already running browser rather than a) spawning a new instance of the same browser or b) a completely different "default browser".
2004-11-06T14:17:00.000Z	unperson	funkytwig	Or all these different programs dealing with sound in a different way, OSS, ALSA, etc.
2004-11-06T14:17:00.000Z	unperson	funkytwig	Usually you can make it work, but getting all your software on the same page is a real chore.
2004-11-06T14:17:00.000Z	funkytwig	unperson	I think opening a new browser is deliberate - in windows when using IE it sometimes looses the page you had and replaces it
2004-11-06T14:18:00.000Z	funkytwig	unperson	I find the integration works very well - a lot of the time stuff just works - expecialy sound - video - CD burning.
2004-11-06T14:19:00.000Z	unperson	funkytwig	You're talking about which distro now?
2004-11-06T14:20:00.000Z	funkytwig	unperson	most linux distros - I was just kind of guessing why it opens a new browser - I suppose a new tab would be better
2004-11-06T14:20:00.000Z	unperson	funkytwig	yes.
2004-11-06T14:20:00.000Z	unperson	funkytwig	Well, it took me a while to get everything working correctly when I switched from OSS to ALSA.
2004-11-06T14:21:00.000Z	unperson	funkytwig	My point is really that because debian aims for a lot of flexability, things can't be set by default to interact in the best way.
2004-11-06T14:21:00.000Z	unperson	funkytwig	Because "the best way" depends a lot on what you have installed.
2004-11-06T14:21:00.000Z	funkytwig	unperson	all I can say is that since I have installed Ubuntu I have has the best set up Linux distro ever and it hass been very painless;)
2004-11-06T14:22:00.000Z	unperson	funkytwig	I like the idea of having a distro where the default stuff works painlessly, and you have the option to stray off the beaten path (and take the consequences) if you like.
2004-11-06T14:22:00.000Z	funkytwig	unperson	I guess one of the things about Ubuntu is they try to choose one of eatch type of app and install it by default
2004-11-06T14:23:00.000Z	funkytwig	unperson	It all depends on if you agree with there choices
2004-11-06T14:23:00.000Z	funkytwig	unperson	so do I ;)
2004-11-06T14:26:00.000Z	funkytwig	unperson	thats a very good question, i'me not sure.  One for the mailing list I guess
2004-11-06T14:28:00.000Z	unperson	funkytwig	Ah.  Well, it's a moot point for now, as my desktop system is a notebook, and I read that notebook support isn't really there yet in Ubuntu.
2004-11-06T14:29:00.000Z	unperson	funkytwig	Which is understandable, since that seems to be quite difficult and the distro is pretty new.
2004-11-06T14:29:00.000Z	unperson	funkytwig	I was interested, though, and will keep my eye on it.
