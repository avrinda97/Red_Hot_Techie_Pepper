2008-09-08T03:11:00.000Z	KenBW22	jrib	thanks
2008-09-08T03:11:00.000Z	jrib	KenBW22	make sure you don't miss a > or your file will be overwritten
2008-09-08T03:11:00.000Z	KenBW22	jrib	roger
2009-03-07T06:44:00.000Z	jrib	KenBW22	erm, what are you doing?
2009-03-07T06:45:00.000Z	KenBW22	jrib	trying to make a crontab
2009-03-07T06:45:00.000Z	jrib	KenBW22	you ran "./crontab"?
2009-03-07T06:45:00.000Z	KenBW22	jrib	yea
2009-03-07T06:45:00.000Z	jrib	KenBW22	why?
2009-03-07T06:45:00.000Z	KenBW22	jrib	i have a file crontab in ~/
2009-03-07T06:45:00.000Z	jrib	KenBW22	you want just "crontab"
2009-03-07T06:45:00.000Z	jrib	KenBW22	sorry.  "crontab -e"
2009-03-07T06:46:00.000Z	KenBW22	jrib	i'm following the instructions here: http://b.pengdeng.com/2008/12/simple-remote-control-with-dropbox.html
2009-03-07T06:46:00.000Z	KenBW22	jrib	says to create a file crontab
2009-03-07T06:47:00.000Z	jrib	KenBW22	doesn't say "./crontab" anywhere
2009-03-07T06:48:00.000Z	KenBW22	jrib	"then run crontab ~/.local/etc/crontab", although my fole is in ~/ rather than ~/.local/etc
2009-03-07T06:49:00.000Z	jrib	KenBW22	sure, still no "./crontab" there
2009-03-07T06:49:00.000Z	KenBW22	jrib	well ~/crontab gives me the same result
2009-03-07T06:50:00.000Z	jrib	KenBW22	you aren't supposed to just run "~/crontab~"... read what it says
2009-03-07T06:50:00.000Z	KenBW22	jrib	oh, running that file is to create the file?
2009-03-07T06:51:00.000Z	KenBW22	jrib	command*
2009-03-07T06:51:00.000Z	jrib	KenBW22	yes
2009-03-07T06:53:00.000Z	KenBW22	jrib	oh, thanks anyway
