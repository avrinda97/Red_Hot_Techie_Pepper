2006-08-17T13:44:00.000Z	ciscosurfer		I have a major problem!!!
2006-08-17T13:45:00.000Z	ciscosurfer		My friend had LILO installed, he upgraded his machine to Dapper, and now his system is hosed...we were able to boot to a live disc and mount his files (so they are still there) and he needs to get LILO working again....issuing lilo at the command line is not working...anyone please help!
2006-08-17T13:47:00.000Z	ciscosurfer		Does anyone have any idea what to do to get it back to working order??
2006-08-17T13:48:00.000Z	ciscosurfer		820 people and no takers???
2006-08-17T13:49:00.000Z	lawine	ciscosurfer	i believe Dapper defaults to Grub. is LILO installed at your friends PC ?
2006-08-17T13:50:00.000Z	ciscosurfer	lawine	Dapper does default to Grub, but he was using LILO (don't ask why) and yes, the Lilo files are there but we can't get Lilo to issue
2006-08-17T13:51:00.000Z	lawine	ciscosurfer	any error messages?

2006-08-17T13:53:00.000Z	lawine	ciscosurfer	if you boot of the live CD, it may be that the mountpoints are buggered
