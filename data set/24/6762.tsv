2005-07-25T07:53:00.000Z	PurpleBlu		Does ubuntu come with KDE?
2005-07-25T07:53:00.000Z	PurpleBlu		yes. I would love KDE
2005-07-25T07:53:00.000Z	reka	PurpleBlu	default DE is gnome, but you can install KDE later
2005-07-25T07:54:00.000Z	reka	PurpleBlu	install kubuntu-desktop for KDE
2005-07-25T07:59:00.000Z	reka	PurpleBlu	there's a search facility. :)
2005-07-25T11:23:00.000Z	reka	PurpleBlu	what are you trying to install?
2005-07-25T11:24:00.000Z	reka	PurpleBlu	er, it's in the repo it seems
2005-07-25T11:24:00.000Z	reka	PurpleBlu	sudo apt-get install superkaramba
2005-07-25T11:24:00.000Z	reka	PurpleBlu	always check the repo first....compiling from source is the "harder" way of doing things
2005-07-25T11:38:00.000Z	PurpleBlu	reka	- searched for superkaramba in Synaptic Packet Manger, nothing.
2005-07-25T11:39:00.000Z	reka	PurpleBlu	it's in universe
2005-07-25T11:41:00.000Z	reka	PurpleBlu	settings > repos
2005-07-25T11:41:00.000Z	reka	PurpleBlu	read the wiki page i sent you
2005-07-25T11:42:00.000Z	PurpleBlu	reka	reading now
2005-07-25T11:48:00.000Z	PurpleBlu	reka	when adding universe repositories, doI  just want to add binaries or source to?
2005-07-25T11:48:00.000Z	reka	PurpleBlu	both
2005-07-25T11:51:00.000Z	PurpleBlu	reka	now when I download theme for superkaramba I dont do it through Synaptic do i?
2005-07-25T11:52:00.000Z	reka	PurpleBlu	not sure....check if there are themes in the repos....if not, then yes, need to do it some other way
2005-07-25T11:55:00.000Z	PurpleBlu	reka	what desktop you use? Gnome, Kde? what?
2005-07-25T11:55:00.000Z	reka	PurpleBlu	gnome
2005-07-25T11:55:00.000Z	reka	PurpleBlu	which is why i have't had experience with superkaramba
2005-07-25T11:55:00.000Z	reka	PurpleBlu	i prefer gnome
2005-07-25T11:56:00.000Z	reka	PurpleBlu	there's #kubuntu and #kde if you didn't know
2005-07-25T11:56:00.000Z	reka	PurpleBlu	i like a minimalist desktop
