2005-06-27T05:25:00.000Z	absinthe_os		He was sort of testing my nerves
2005-06-27T05:25:00.000Z	absinthe_os		=)
2005-06-27T05:26:00.000Z	absinthe_os		lol ninwa
2005-06-27T05:27:00.000Z	absinthe_os		So, is everyone using Gnome these days? I've thought about branching out to some other desktops
2005-06-27T05:27:00.000Z	absinthe_os		cynetix, shoot
2005-06-27T05:28:00.000Z	Cynetix	absinthe_os	I have Ubuntu installed and it goes through, states it will reboot inot Ubuntu but it never happens
2005-06-27T05:28:00.000Z	absinthe_os	Cynetix	Sorry I'm not understanding
2005-06-27T05:29:00.000Z	Cynetix	absinthe_os	I guess. I told it to install Grub to MBR but no boot options, nada
2005-06-27T05:30:00.000Z	absinthe_os	Cynetix	Are you in Windows right now?
2005-06-27T05:30:00.000Z	absinthe_os	Cynetix	same pc?
2005-06-27T05:30:00.000Z	Cynetix	absinthe_os	However, let me preface that by saying it's installed on the second drive in my system on a SATA controller.
2005-06-27T05:30:00.000Z	Cynetix	absinthe_os	The one I'm talking with you now on yes :)
2005-06-27T05:31:00.000Z	Cynetix	absinthe_os	Do you know an easy way to make a boot floppy from windows so I can see if it can be accessed that way?
2005-06-27T05:32:00.000Z	Cynetix	absinthe_os	Heh, it's been reinstalled 12 times. I started out with Mandrake and finally gave up :)
2005-06-27T05:32:00.000Z	Cynetix	absinthe_os	That
2005-06-27T05:33:00.000Z	Cynetix	absinthe_os	That's cool. I appreciate the attempt :) Hopefully someone on the Ubuntu board will be able to help...someday :)
2005-06-27T05:34:00.000Z	Cynetix	absinthe_os	yeah, I have the wiki guide for dual-boot as well. None really address my particular situation.
2005-06-27T05:35:00.000Z	Cynetix	absinthe_os	Hmm. How do I do that or do you have a guide for it?
2005-06-27T05:36:00.000Z	Cynetix	absinthe_os	Ok. Do you know a way to get df info from CD? It only returns temp info.
2005-06-27T05:38:00.000Z	absinthe_os	Cynetix	maybe that helps?
2005-06-27T05:38:00.000Z	Cynetix	absinthe_os	Hmm. I wouldn't think it was the BIOS 1024 issue because my box is barely 6 months old and it's SATA instead of IDE but I could be mistaken.
2005-06-27T05:40:00.000Z	Cynetix	absinthe_os	I'll use this and maybe be able to work through. We'll see what happens :) Thanks for your time and suggestions. Later.
