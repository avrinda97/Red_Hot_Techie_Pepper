2007-02-14T15:26:00.000Z	mzuverink		can i use fetchmail to get mail from my two gmail accounts and then somehow pipe them to spamassassin and then place them in a mailbox in my home dir to be accessable by thunderbird?
2007-02-14T15:28:00.000Z	mzuverink		Where would be the proper channel to ask fetchmail related questions?
2007-02-14T08:00:00.000Z	mzuverink		Can you set up fetchmail to get your mail and then pipe it through spamassassin, and then place it in a maildir or mbox in your home dir so you can check it with thunderbird?
2007-02-14T08:02:00.000Z	cma	mzuverink	I don't think you can with Thunderbird
2007-02-14T08:04:00.000Z	mzuverink	cma	I know you cant pipe with thunderbird, hence why I want to use fetchmail.  I think itd be some kind of fetchmail/procmail recipie, but just looking for verification
2007-02-14T08:06:00.000Z	cma	mzuverink	well I really havn't used TB but from what I have seen it dosn't to want to know about local mail spools etc.
2007-02-14T08:07:00.000Z	mzuverink	cma	sure it does, what real mail client wouldn, it does spools of all sorts
2007-02-14T08:09:00.000Z	cma	mzuverink	hmm! I am interested. How do you get read from /var/mail?
2007-02-14T08:11:00.000Z	mzuverink	cma	you just choose unix mail spool(movemail) and tell it your box location
2007-02-14T08:12:00.000Z	cma	mzuverink	is that part of that set wizard thing?
2007-02-14T08:12:00.000Z	mzuverink	cma	yeah
2007-02-14T08:12:00.000Z	cma	mzuverink	is that part of that setup wizard thing?
2007-02-14T08:12:00.000Z	mzuverink	cma	yeah(x2)
2007-02-14T08:12:00.000Z	cma	mzuverink	hehe
2007-02-14T08:13:00.000Z	mzuverink	cma	too early in the morning to have to answer twice ;)
2007-02-14T08:14:00.000Z	cma	mzuverink	I'll check it out some time. I've only ever used mutt and mail with exim, fetch and co.
2007-02-14T08:14:00.000Z	mzuverink		gotcha
2007-02-14T08:14:00.000Z	mzuverink		opps, cma, gotcha
2007-02-14T08:14:00.000Z	cma	mzuverink	too late at night :)
2007-02-14T08:16:00.000Z	cma	mzuverink	I havn't actually set any of that up on this recent ubuntu install.
2007-02-14T08:16:00.000Z	mzuverink	cma	I think I might go back to s&c gtk, but mozilla came out with the lightening addon(a calandar like sunbird) whiich integrates nicely, and its not all bloat like evolution, but the spamassassin deal has me by the jewels(family)
2007-02-14T08:18:00.000Z	mzuverink	cma	currently I am just using gmail to filter spam, their not bad, about 90 %, but that last 10% I would rather not see
2007-02-14T08:18:00.000Z	cma	mzuverink	Yeah, yahoo for me. Same deal.
2007-02-14T08:20:00.000Z	cma	mzuverink	I'm actually going to give evolution a look.  Although I feel a bit dubious.
