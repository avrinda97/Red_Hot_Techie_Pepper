2012-07-08T22:46:00.000Z	Jordan_U	giulia27	How did you "format" the drive?
2012-07-08T22:48:00.000Z	Jordan_U	giulia27	So you created a partition on this disk, I presume. What filesystem does this partition contain?
2012-07-08T22:49:00.000Z	giulia27	Jordan_U	fat32
2012-07-08T22:49:00.000Z	Jordan_U	giulia27	And just so you are aware, this has nothing to do with being "bootable".
2012-07-08T22:50:00.000Z	Jordan_U	giulia27	Can you pastebin the output of "sudo parted -l" while the drive is plugged in?
2012-07-08T22:51:00.000Z	giulia27	Jordan_U	hold on, I run the command
2012-07-08T22:52:00.000Z	giulia27	Jordan_U	here is the pastebin http://pastebin.com/8vddyErT
2012-07-08T22:54:00.000Z	Jordan_U	giulia27	OK, your external drive is clearly not listed there at all at the moment. Do any other USB drives that you have show up in Nautilus when you plug them in?
2012-07-08T22:55:00.000Z	giulia27	Jordan_U	no
2012-07-08T22:56:00.000Z	Jordan_U	giulia27	Do you have another drive which you can test with?
2012-07-08T22:56:00.000Z	giulia27	Jordan_U	I have no idea where are my usb drives
2012-07-08T23:03:00.000Z	Jordan_U	giulia27	Are you sure that there isn't a hardware problem with the USB drive which isn't working?
2012-07-08T23:04:00.000Z	giulia27	Jordan_U	normally yes, I checked it
2012-07-08T23:05:00.000Z	Jordan_U	giulia27	A drive mounting automatically when plugged in has *nothing* to do with it being "bootable".
2012-07-08T23:16:00.000Z	Jordan_U	giulia27	Are you trying to boot from this drive? Will you ever be *booting* from this drive?
2012-07-08T23:31:00.000Z	Jordan_U	giulia27	OK, then forget about the word "bootable" entirely. Being "bootable" has *nothing* to do with this, and you have already confused myself and sasser by using the word. Do you understand?
2012-07-08T23:32:00.000Z	giulia27	Jordan_U	yes. So which word must I use instead then ?
2012-07-08T23:33:00.000Z	Jordan_U	giulia27	I'm not sure that one word alone describes it. I would say that "I just want my USB disk to be seen in Nautilus and work" is a good description though.
2012-07-08T23:34:00.000Z	Jordan_U	giulia27	You're welcome.
2012-07-08T23:34:00.000Z	Jordan_U	giulia27	Could you pastebin the output of "dmesg"?
2012-07-08T23:45:00.000Z	Jordan_U	giulia27	Was the USB drive plugged in when you ran "sudo blkid"?
2012-07-08T23:45:00.000Z	giulia27	Jordan_U	yes
2012-07-08T23:56:00.000Z	Jordan_U	giulia27	Try running "sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/" (though my guess is that it will fail.
2012-07-09T00:02:00.000Z	giulia27	Jordan_U	it failed, said that /dev/sda1 does not exist
