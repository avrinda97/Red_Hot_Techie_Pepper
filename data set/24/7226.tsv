2005-04-07T09:49:00.000Z	Jentoo000		updating apt-get takes a while *_*
2005-04-07T09:50:00.000Z	Jentoo000		i recon ubuntu is the best distribution for newbies and advanced linux uers so far
2005-04-07T09:50:00.000Z	Jentoo000		wish i had gkrellm working
2005-04-07T09:50:00.000Z	eyequeue	Jentoo000	 works here, what seems to be the problem?
2005-04-07T09:51:00.000Z	Jentoo000	eyequeue	dont know where to start once I've downloaded it, what file should i download
2005-04-07T09:51:00.000Z	eyequeue	Jentoo000	 you have the deb?
2005-04-07T09:51:00.000Z	Jentoo000		 i want stuff on my desktop showing my speed, hwo much room i got on my computer etc
2005-04-07T09:51:00.000Z	Jentoo000		whats deb? I've been mucking around with my list file and ive seen the word deb in it
2005-04-07T09:51:00.000Z	eyequeue	Jentoo000	 are you familiar with synaptic?
2005-04-07T09:52:00.000Z	Jentoo000	eyequeue	I dont understand it much so i just use the console
2005-04-07T09:52:00.000Z	eyequeue	Jentoo000	 okay, you're brand new, right?  don't want to talk down, just be clear
2005-04-07T09:52:00.000Z	Jentoo000	eyequeue	yes
2005-04-07T09:53:00.000Z	eyequeue	Jentoo000	 okay, i'll give you commandline alternatives, and i'll give you synaptic alternatives, you can choose which you prefer at the end before doing them
2005-04-07T09:53:00.000Z	Jentoo000	eyequeue	for? I havent downloaded any of the gkrellms yet though
2005-04-07T09:53:00.000Z	eyequeue	Jentoo000	 apt-cache search gkrellm | less  .... that will get you a list of what pacakges there are, then you can choose which you like
2005-04-07T09:54:00.000Z	Jentoo000		hmm ok
2005-04-07T09:54:00.000Z	eyequeue	Jentoo000	 then, assuming they are called "foo" and "bar" (which is unlikely, lol) you would "sudo apt-get install foo bar"
2005-04-07T09:54:00.000Z	eyequeue	Jentoo000	 that's the commandline style, now i'll explain the synaptic style
2005-04-07T09:55:00.000Z	Jentoo000		what the it just shows _ that in rows
2005-04-07T09:55:00.000Z	Jentoo000		up the top it says gkrelldnet - A dnetc plugin for GKrellM
2005-04-07T09:55:00.000Z	eyequeue	Jentoo000	 system > administration > synaptic, to start it, then push the Search button, and type in gkrellm
2005-04-07T09:55:00.000Z	eyequeue	Jentoo000	 you'll have a list of pacakges, pick the ones you want, right click on them, and say you want to select them for installation
2005-04-07T09:56:00.000Z	Jentoo000		man can u whisper to me this is too hard
2005-04-07T09:56:00.000Z	eyequeue	Jentoo000	 click on apply, and it's done
