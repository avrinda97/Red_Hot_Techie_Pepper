2006-10-09T15:55:00.000Z	vulcanium		onboard auio on a DFI ultra d
2006-10-09T15:55:00.000Z	vulcanium		I've gotten to work, but only barely
2006-10-09T15:55:00.000Z	vulcanium		serverly distorted sound and its really quiet
2006-10-09T15:56:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	vulcanium	if you have found a sound card that doesn't work under ubuntu, given the devs have removed alsaconf, then you need to file a bug report
2006-10-09T15:58:00.000Z	vulcanium	TheGateKeeper	what did alsoconf do?
2006-10-09T15:59:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	vulcanium	use it for installing sound drivers
2006-10-09T15:59:00.000Z	vulcanium		ah
2006-10-09T15:59:00.000Z	vulcanium		well I tried everythign in that sound guide
2006-10-09T15:59:00.000Z	vulcanium		nothing made any change
2006-10-09T15:59:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	vulcanium	or at least you would if the devs hadn't removed it
2006-10-09T16:00:00.000Z	vulcanium		I can't just add in back in somehow TheGateKeeper?
2006-10-09T16:00:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	vulcanium	the driver?
2006-10-10T16:01:00.000Z	vulcanium	TheGateKeeper	alsaconf
2006-10-10T16:02:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	vulcanium	well it's not in the repos
2006-10-10T16:03:00.000Z	vulcanium	TheGateKeeper	well, can't I get around that somehow still?
2006-10-10T16:03:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	vulcanium	I suppose you could get a debian version (don't know if that would work) or compile it
2006-10-10T16:03:00.000Z	vulcanium		well its owrth a try at this point I think
2006-10-10T16:03:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper		!sound
2006-10-10T16:03:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	vulcanium	^^^^
2006-10-10T16:05:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	vulcanium	dev's attitude seems to be, if it doesn't work file a bug
2006-10-10T16:05:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	vulcanium	at least that is what they told me
