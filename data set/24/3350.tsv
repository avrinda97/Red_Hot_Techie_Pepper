2008-02-17T12:29:00.000Z	bazhang		what is the card thedjatclubrock
2008-02-17T12:29:00.000Z	bazhang		carbon you have an issue?
2008-02-17T12:29:00.000Z	tdjacr|away	bazhang	Intel I believe
2008-02-17T12:30:00.000Z	tdjacr|away	bazhang	I have to go to bed, any last ideas?
2008-02-17T12:31:00.000Z	bazhang	tdjacr|away	restarted already with only the one card and the ethernet installed? ifconfig recognizes your card but fails to give a connection?
2008-02-17T12:31:00.000Z	tdjacr|away	bazhang	Yep :P
2008-02-17T12:31:00.000Z	tdjacr|away	bazhang	Ideas?
2008-02-17T12:32:00.000Z	bazhang	tdjacr|away	what about your cable modem? you have access to it?
2008-02-17T12:32:00.000Z	tdjacr|away	bazhang	Yes, but it seems to be woorking (i am on irc)
2008-02-17T12:32:00.000Z	bazhang	tdjacr|away	and how about a direct connection no through the router
2008-02-17T12:33:00.000Z	tdjacr|away	bazhang	IDK, the router is in the garage, but my irc somputer is off of the same switch.
2008-02-17T12:34:00.000Z	bazhang	tdjacr|away	could be a router connection issue--if everything else remains the same and the cable modem is fine, then I suspect it it the ubuntu box has trouble communicating through the router
2008-02-17T12:35:00.000Z	tdjacr|away	bazhang	I have another ubuntu box that works fine through the switch, and this one worked brfore after a dhclient
2008-02-17T12:35:00.000Z	bazhang	tdjacr|away	after when did it stop working--if you can recall--also does a livecd get the internet connection
2008-02-17T12:37:00.000Z	tdjacr|away	bazhang	I don't have a live CD atm, it stopped working after my chgrp mistake
2008-02-17T12:37:00.000Z	tdjacr|away	bazhang	Should I just reinstall?
2008-02-17T12:37:00.000Z	bazhang	tdjacr|away	aha then that would be the prime suspect--what chgrp was this you speak of? I would get the livecd and boot up from that and see if that can get the internet
2008-02-17T12:38:00.000Z	tdjacr|away	bazhang	I accidentally set all files to root as the group :P
2008-02-17T12:38:00.000Z	bazhang	tdjacr|away	back up and then try the livecd--if that does it, then either fix the permissions or just reinstall
2008-02-17T12:39:00.000Z	tdjacr|away	bazhang	I don't have a cd drive atm, It'll have to wait
2008-02-17T12:39:00.000Z	tdjacr|away	bazhang	Thank you
2008-02-17T12:39:00.000Z	tdjacr|away	bazhang	Good night
2008-02-17T12:39:00.000Z	bazhang	tdjacr|away	sorry not to catch that chgrp earlier ;[
2008-02-17T12:39:00.000Z	tdjacr|away	bazhang	It was my fault :P
