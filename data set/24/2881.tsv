2008-07-22T08:32:00.000Z	Dewente		how so important is to know Shell Scripting ?
2008-07-22T08:33:00.000Z	unop	Dewente	i'd say very important
2008-07-22T08:35:00.000Z	unop	Dewente	well you can administer systems without knowing much shell scripting - you'd just not be a very good one, shell scripting makes easy jobs easier and difficult jobs possible

2008-07-22T08:37:00.000Z	unop	Dewente	if you can get your hands on this book, it's quite invaluble.   Learning the Bash Shell from O'Reilly
2008-07-22T08:37:00.000Z	unop	Dewente	before doing what tho?
2008-07-22T08:38:00.000Z	Dewente	unop	before keep reading about administration duties
2008-07-22T08:38:00.000Z	Dewente	unop	Learning the Bash Shell from O'Reilly tha's is a book too ?
2008-07-22T08:39:00.000Z	unop	Dewente	i would say you need to do both of them simultaneously
2008-07-22T08:39:00.000Z	unop	Dewente	yea, it's a book from o'reilly - http://oreilly.com/catalog/9781565923478/
2008-07-22T08:39:00.000Z	Dewente	unop	but the rest going to be easier is i learn how to programmer on shell
2008-07-22T08:41:00.000Z	unop	Dewente	not necessarily - though you automatically exercise advanced shell scriping when doing advanced administration
2008-07-22T08:42:00.000Z	unop	Dewente	apart from bash there are a few other tools you might like to learn.  awk, sed  - and maybe perl or ruby
2008-07-22T08:42:00.000Z	Dewente	unop	whyyyyyyyyyyyyy
2008-07-22T08:43:00.000Z	unop	Dewente	well, awk and sed are part of "shell scripting".  but shell scripting is limited, sometimes you have to do jobs that shell scripting cannot do - that's where perl or ruby comes in
2008-07-22T08:44:00.000Z	unop	Dewente	i am not saying you should become a master at these tools.  just know enough to get by
2008-07-22T08:44:00.000Z	Dewente	unop	i see, but the first step is shell right ?
2008-07-22T08:44:00.000Z	unop	Dewente	yes indeed
2008-07-22T08:45:00.000Z	Dewente	unop	i want to get a job just as a jr. administration
2008-07-22T08:45:00.000Z	unop	Dewente	pass the LPI level 1 exam then :)
2008-07-22T08:46:00.000Z	Dewente	unop	this is one of my goal ..
2008-07-22T08:46:00.000Z	Dewente	unop	did you di it ?
2008-07-22T08:47:00.000Z	unop	Dewente	no, though i might do it at a later stage
2008-07-22T08:52:00.000Z	Dewente	unop	?
