2005-10-19T12:36:00.000Z	topyli	xfelon	you have already unzipped the tar.gz, so you just need to extract the tarball. you can do that in one step as well
2005-10-19T12:37:00.000Z	topyli	xfelon	tar xzf blahblah.tar.gz. or, if you have a bzipped tarball, tar xjf blahblah.tar.bz2
2005-10-19T12:38:00.000Z	topyli	xfelon	you don't want to install tar from source. you already have tar
2005-10-19T12:39:00.000Z	topyli	xfelon	in fact you don't want to install anything from source
2005-10-19T12:40:00.000Z	topyli	xfelon	get rid of the tarballs and go about your daily business :)
2005-10-19T12:40:00.000Z	topyli	xfelon	no, you have to get java from Sun
2005-10-19T12:41:00.000Z	topyli	xfelon	it's in the System menu of your top panel
2005-10-19T12:43:00.000Z	topyli	xfelon	you do have a gui. you just said you have stuff on your desktop
2005-10-19T12:43:00.000Z	topyli	xfelon	the installer has configured it for you
2005-10-19T12:44:00.000Z	topyli	xfelon	yes
2005-10-19T12:49:00.000Z	topyli	xfelon	look at what ubotu just said
2005-10-19T12:50:00.000Z	topyli	xfelon	debian is the mothership, many linux distributions (like ubuntu) are based on it
2005-10-19T12:56:00.000Z	topyli	xfelon	sure, until you empty the trash
2005-10-19T12:57:00.000Z	topyli	xfelon	it's in your bottom panel, on the right
