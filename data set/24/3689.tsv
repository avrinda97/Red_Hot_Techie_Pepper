2008-06-06T08:07:00.000Z	Aintaer		Well I try to solve things by myself first

2008-06-06T08:07:00.000Z	m1r	Aintaer	what is problem ?
2008-06-06T08:07:00.000Z	Aintaer		no problem now, just trying to build serialmonkey's RT2500 drivers
2008-06-06T08:08:00.000Z	Aintaer		okay, do I have to build these for every kernel I have?
2008-06-06T08:08:00.000Z	m1r	Aintaer	i guess for master mode ?
2008-06-06T08:08:00.000Z	Aintaer		If so, can I do it all at once

2008-06-06T08:11:00.000Z	Aintaer	m1r	that's very useful, but not exactly my problem
2008-06-06T08:11:00.000Z	Aintaer		my problem is, I have multiple kernels
2008-06-06T08:11:00.000Z	m1r	Aintaer	build for last one then ?
2008-06-06T08:11:00.000Z	Aintaer		do I have to rebuild these kernel modules for every one of those kernels
2008-06-06T08:12:00.000Z	m1r	Aintaer	i am not sure about kernel modules , but i think yes
2008-06-06T08:12:00.000Z	Aintaer		So can I build modules for a different kernel
2008-06-06T08:12:00.000Z	Aintaer		than the one I'm running now
