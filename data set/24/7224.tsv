2005-03-24T17:38:00.000Z	Slackman	knucks	apt-get remove xorg
2005-03-24T17:38:00.000Z	knucks	Slackman	i installed nvidia-glx, and now x tells me there aer no screens present
2005-03-24T17:39:00.000Z	Slackman	knucks	well i think you should have a back up file in that case...otherwise just run xorgconfig or xconfig which ever your running
2005-03-24T17:39:00.000Z	knucks	Slackman	i tried..still no go

2005-03-24T17:40:00.000Z	Slackman	knucks	re-install Xfree or xorg...which ever you were using to begin with
