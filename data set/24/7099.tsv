2005-07-03T12:10:00.000Z	IceDC571		error:
2005-07-03T12:11:00.000Z	ratl3	IceDC571	shit, have you filed a bugzilla report?
2005-07-03T12:14:00.000Z	IceDC571	ratl3	go to the terminal type apt-get moo
2005-07-03T12:18:00.000Z	IceDC571	ratl3	i read it wrong.. i thought you said isnt too.. my stupid vision
2005-07-03T12:19:00.000Z	ratl3	IceDC571	heh
2005-07-03T12:19:00.000Z	ratl3	IceDC571	it's great mistyping whole words instead of just letters...
2005-07-03T12:20:00.000Z	ratl3	IceDC571	common words just flow out so easily.... so if a word is similar to a common word sometimes i just type that word
2005-07-03T12:20:00.000Z	ratl3	IceDC571	it takes a while to get used to the switch
2005-07-03T12:20:00.000Z	IceDC571	ratl3	you're actually using it?
2005-07-03T12:21:00.000Z	ratl3	IceDC571	i can only type dvorak on this keyboard, but on other keyboards i'm fine with qwerty
2005-07-03T12:21:00.000Z	ratl3	IceDC571	by switch i mean alternating between dvorak and qwerty
2005-07-03T12:21:00.000Z	IceDC571	ratl3	so its like once you learn dvorak you can pretty much type with both qwerty and dvorak fluently?
2005-07-03T12:21:00.000Z	ratl3	IceDC571	it's only about 5 to 10% better
2005-07-03T12:22:00.000Z	ratl3	IceDC571	on a switch, say i go to a friends house, it'll take me about 5 mins to warm up
2005-07-03T12:22:00.000Z	ratl3	IceDC571	then i'll be back to what i was originally
2005-07-03T12:23:00.000Z	IceDC571	ratl3	do you have a dvorak permanent keyboard, modified keys, or stick-ons?
2005-07-03T12:23:00.000Z	ratl3	IceDC571	it doesn't take much to learn either though... 10 or 20 times easier to learn than qwerty
2005-07-03T12:25:00.000Z	ratl3	IceDC571	i think it's best just to get a qwerty keyboard you like and some stickers
2005-07-03T12:32:00.000Z	ratl3	IceDC571	heart attack, stroke....
