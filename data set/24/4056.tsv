2010-06-23T08:59:00.000Z	selig5	jdsbluedevl	I shared internet with Firestarter, took me a while to get it sorted out...
2010-06-23T09:03:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl	selig5	ifconfig says Eth0 is up
2010-06-23T09:03:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl	selig5	how else would I start the interface?
2010-06-23T09:04:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl	selig5	ok, what do I give it?
2010-06-23T09:05:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl	selig5	ok, I did ifconfig eth0 192.168.0.1
2010-06-23T09:06:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl	selig5	ok, set up the IP address for the second card.  What next?
2010-06-23T09:08:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl	selig5	apparently the share is up now after running the wizard again, but Roku isn't detecting an ethernet connection
2010-06-23T09:12:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl	selig5	ok, pretend it's an Xbox
2010-06-23T09:13:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl	selig5	is that Firestarter?
2010-06-23T09:14:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl	selig5	the way I see it, the whole problem revolves around not being able to set up a connection profile on the second card
2010-06-23T09:14:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl	selig5	dhcpd?  not in aptitude
2010-06-23T09:15:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl	selig5	you mean dhcpcd?
2010-06-23T09:17:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl	selig5	ok, that's installed, then stopped and restarted Firestarter
2010-06-23T09:18:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl	selig5	but I'm guessing I have to do something with that dhcpcd, right?
2010-06-23T09:19:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl	selig5	ok, how do I do that?
2010-06-23T09:19:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl	selig5	talk to me like I'm a n00b, which I am
2010-06-23T09:24:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl	selig5	yeah, just saw that.  am looking at Jonathan Moeller's page
2010-06-23T09:26:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl	selig5	do I need to add a static DNS server as well?
2010-06-23T09:28:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl	selig5	ok.  Well, tried restarting network manager, then tried to connect Roku, still no luck
2010-06-23T09:29:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl	selig5	even worse, now it says the device isn't managed after making those weird additions to /etc/network/interfaces
2010-06-23T09:33:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl	selig5	crossover cable?  when I had this working before it got all borked up, I didn't need a crossover cable
2010-06-23T09:34:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl	selig5	as I said, the whole critical problem with this is that as before I could set up a  connection profile under network connections with my second card, I can't now, and I think Lucid is the problem
2010-06-23T09:40:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl	selig5	thought so.  Maybe an update addresses this?  I guess I'll just have to wait until I can get the computer set up to what it was before I wiped it, and then update it
2010-06-23T09:41:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl	selig5	otherwise, I may think of screaming to Canonical about how they screwed up network connection management in Lucid
