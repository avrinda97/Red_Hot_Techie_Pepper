2011-07-07T20:28:00.000Z	phper_		Hello. I run ubuntu 11.04 at virtuabox, now I have a php script that at our server works normally, but at virtuabox it seems it can't connect to the dns for the database connection
2011-07-07T20:28:00.000Z	phper_		how can I make ubuntu at virtuabox to see the dns?
2011-07-07T20:29:00.000Z	dr_willis	phper_	 vbox has network settings where the vbox machine can appear on the lan as if it was a 'real' physical machine. gettting the dns and ip info from the lans dhcp server.
2011-07-07T20:29:00.000Z	dr_willis	phper_	 you may want to try that. or set its dns and ip statically
2011-07-07T20:30:00.000Z	phper_	dr_willis	I am not sure what to do
2011-07-07T20:30:00.000Z	dr_willis	phper_	 try the other network settings in vbox.. shut it down.. try differnt setting.. start it.. check its ip/if it works..
2011-07-07T20:31:00.000Z	phper_	dr_willis	if I access a website from the network, e.g. http://10.10.10.9/site the browser loads it normally at virtuabox ubuntu
2011-07-07T20:32:00.000Z	phper_	dr_willis	maybe if I try wubi? Does it see the DNS?
2011-07-07T20:32:00.000Z	dr_willis	phper_	 i sugested trying the other network settings/modes in vbox first...
2011-07-07T20:33:00.000Z	phper_	dr_willis	thanks, I will try that tomorrow at work
2011-07-07T20:33:00.000Z	dr_willis	phper_	 vbox can set up a private lan, (by default) that may be causing the issue. check the dns server setting the box;s are using and what vbox is using.
2011-07-07T20:33:00.000Z	dr_willis	phper_	 you may want to check out the network settings section in the vbox manual.
2011-07-07T20:46:00.000Z	phper_	dr_willis	But can virtuabox ubuntu see the dns of databases in the network if I experiment with the virtua dns server settings? and what is the difference between the box and vbox?
2011-07-07T21:15:00.000Z	dr_willis	phper_	 its also possible the databases are set where they only allow access from ip's on the same local lan.
2011-07-07T21:17:00.000Z	phper_	dr_willis	I will ask the system administrator tomorrow
2011-07-07T21:19:00.000Z	phper_	dr_willis	iif the databases are set to allow access from ip's on the same local lan, it will be impossible to access the databases from the virtuabox ubuntu?
2011-07-07T21:21:00.000Z	dr_willis	phper_	 as we have mentioned Several times now.. there IS a virtualbox network setting that makes the vbox instance appear on the local lan as IF it was a 'real' machine on the local lan...
2011-07-07T21:22:00.000Z	dr_willis	phper_	 or you could set up a ssh tunnle. but that would be a little overkll for a vbox on the lan.
2011-07-07T21:25:00.000Z	phper_	dr_willis	thanks, that setting is the bridge mode?
2011-07-07T21:25:00.000Z	dr_willis	phper_	 i always have to reread the docs.. ior just try all the modes . till one of them gets a local lan ip.
2011-07-07T21:26:00.000Z	phper_	dr_willis	many thanks for the information
2011-07-07T21:27:00.000Z	dr_willis	phper_	 i learned it all from the vbox manuals. :) at the vbox homepage.
2011-07-25T13:17:00.000Z	dr_willis	phper_	 you are runnit in some sort of virtual box/qemu? or  did you do an ormal install to a flash drive
2011-07-25T13:17:00.000Z	phper_	dr_willis	it uses colinux for virtualisation
