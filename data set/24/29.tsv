2012-10-31T17:42:00.000Z	AlexNagy		Hey all, I have a problem with 12.04 LTS. I've resized the partition twice (shrinking it down leaving a few GBs free each time) with a GParted boot-stick. the first time all went well, but now it boot. The only difference is I moved the swap to a different primary partition. It won't boot in rescue mood or anything. It just freezes at the loading screen (UBUNTU with the dots underneath). I have 3g of RAM
2012-10-31T17:43:00.000Z	AlexNagy		but now it won't boot*
2012-10-31T17:44:00.000Z	vfw	AlexNagy	Looks like maybe you've changed the partition number of the  root  filesystem.
2012-10-31T17:44:00.000Z	vfw	AlexNagy	Grub tries but will not boot?  What error do you get?
2012-10-31T17:45:00.000Z	AlexNagy	vfw	Ubuntu is the first partition, and always has been. GRUB loads, and I can get to it checking battery state (I'm on a laptop) but it catches there. No error.
2012-10-31T17:45:00.000Z	vfw	AlexNagy	So you have only one Linux partition?
2012-10-31T17:46:00.000Z	vfw	AlexNagy	I think it's a different problem.
2012-10-31T17:46:00.000Z	AlexNagy	vfw	I have three. 1: Ubuntu ext4; 2: ext2 (formerly swap), 3: ufs, 4: swap (new)

2012-10-31T17:49:00.000Z	vfw	AlexNagy	Did you change fstab entries?
2012-10-31T17:49:00.000Z	vfw	AlexNagy	What is ufs?
2012-10-31T17:50:00.000Z	AlexNagy	vfw	No, I didn't. ufs is the native fs for FreeBSD (which I'm chatting from now)
2012-10-31T17:51:00.000Z	vfw	AlexNagy	So you moved the swap partition from the second to the forth partition?
2012-10-31T17:51:00.000Z	AlexNagy	vfw	Yes, as I was needing a unified space to act as intermediary betweeun Ubuntu and FreeBSD
2012-10-31T17:52:00.000Z	vfw	AlexNagy	And Ubuntu is in the first partition and always has been?  /dev/sda1
2012-10-31T17:52:00.000Z	AlexNagy	vfw	Yes
2012-10-31T17:52:00.000Z	vfw	AlexNagy	Why couldn't it stay there as the third partition?
2012-10-31T17:53:00.000Z	AlexNagy	vfw	Because gparted doesn't handle ufs, though it recognizes it. Otherwise I would have made ext2 third and ufs fourth
2012-10-31T17:53:00.000Z	vfw	AlexNagy	You created the new ext2 partition (/dev/sda2) for what reason?
2012-10-31T17:54:00.000Z	vfw	AlexNagy	Well, you could have just changed the partition's ID
2012-10-31T17:54:00.000Z	AlexNagy	vfw	To transfer a massive amount of files from ubuntu to FreeBSD and to act as the home of Dropbox on Ubuntu (no FreeBSD support)
2012-10-31T17:54:00.000Z	vfw	AlexNagy	You can change partition IDs non-destructively with fdisk
2012-10-31T17:55:00.000Z	AlexNagy	vfw	Thanks, I'll see what I can do. Thanks for the help.
2012-10-31T17:56:00.000Z	vfw	AlexNagy	Ok, well at any rate, see: http://askubuntu.com/questions/205695/12-04-hangs-at-checking-battery-state
