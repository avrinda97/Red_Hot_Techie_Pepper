2005-11-25T16:22:00.000Z	n0dl	LjL	Do you know how to start Xterm in X windows?
2005-11-25T16:22:00.000Z	n0dl	LjL	im using Openbox
2005-11-25T16:22:00.000Z	LjL	n0dl	i have no idea with openbox, never used it... but GDM, KDM or whatever should have a "safe mode" (or somesuch) in their "Session" menu to have you start an xterm
2005-11-25T16:23:00.000Z	n0dl	LjL	do i need GDM? i thought thats just a log screen
2005-11-25T16:24:00.000Z	LjL	n0dl	yeah, it's the login screen... how exactly are you going to start X without it? that is unless you're using startx, are you?
2005-11-25T16:24:00.000Z	n0dl	LjL	yeah im using startx
2005-11-25T16:24:00.000Z	LjL	n0dl	then "man startx"
2005-11-25T16:30:00.000Z	LjL	n0dl	nothing more than an X server, i think
2005-11-25T16:31:00.000Z	n0dl	LjL	hmm thats awkward i wonder why it doesnt pop up
2005-11-25T16:32:00.000Z	LjL	n0dl	what are you typing?
2005-11-25T16:32:00.000Z	n0dl	LjL	i type startx
2005-11-25T16:32:00.000Z	LjL	n0dl	try "startx xterm"
2005-11-25T16:32:00.000Z	n0dl	LjL	then i left click and try clicking on terminal emulator
2005-11-25T16:35:00.000Z	n0dl	LjL	a terminal showed up but it froze X
2005-11-25T16:35:00.000Z	n0dl	LjL	do you think i have to install all the X11 files?
2005-11-25T16:36:00.000Z	LjL	n0dl	X didn't freeze, i think, it just didn't start your OpenBox. "startx xterm" just start X with an xterm, and nothing else. for running it inside OpenBox, i think you should find a "run program" or "execute command" (or something) menu, and type "xterm" there, if the default "Terminal emulator" button doesn't work
2005-11-25T16:36:00.000Z	LjL	n0dl	the "Terminal emulator" button is probably looking for some *different* terminal that is not xterm, i think
2005-11-25T16:36:00.000Z	n0dl	LjL	so what exactly do you want me to do?
2005-11-25T16:36:00.000Z	LjL	n0dl	what X11 files don't you have installed?
2005-11-25T16:37:00.000Z	n0dl	LjL	just the base and xterm thats it
2005-11-25T16:37:00.000Z	LjL	n0dl	and openbox, i suppose?
2005-11-25T16:37:00.000Z	n0dl	LjL	yes
2005-11-25T16:38:00.000Z	n0dl	LjL	should i install the other X11 files?
2005-11-25T16:39:00.000Z	LjL	n0dl	i'm really not sure what "other X11" files you're thinking about. what i think, anyway, is that you should simply look up on OpenBox's manual how to start arbitrary programs, or how to add them to the programs menu (assuming OpenBox has one)
