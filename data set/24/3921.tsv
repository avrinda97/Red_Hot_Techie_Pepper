2009-01-09T17:56:00.000Z	adam7		they can't both be in /etc/xorg/xorg.conf
2009-01-09T17:56:00.000Z	adam7		or /etc/X11/xorg.conf, rather
2009-01-09T17:58:00.000Z	adam7		!es
2009-01-09T18:00:00.000Z	adam7		!xconfig | smelian
2009-01-09T18:00:00.000Z	adam7		ah, I was close
2009-01-09T18:01:00.000Z	adam7		.conf
2009-01-09T18:01:00.000Z	adam7		because 8.10 doesn't need xorg.conf
2009-01-09T18:02:00.000Z	gogereaver	adam7	what?
2009-01-09T18:02:00.000Z	adam7	gogereaver	?
2009-01-09T18:03:00.000Z	gogereaver	adam7	the corg conf thats crazy
2009-01-09T18:03:00.000Z	adam7	gogereaver	8.10 will run fine even if you rm /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2009-01-09T18:03:00.000Z	gogereaver	adam7	wtf
2009-01-09T18:04:00.000Z	adam7	gogereaver	it's the new xorg :/
2009-01-09T18:05:00.000Z	gogereaver	adam7	what does it auto regn the file
2009-01-09T18:05:00.000Z	adam7	gogereaver	no
2009-01-09T18:05:00.000Z	adam7	gogereaver	it just doesn't need one
2009-01-09T18:05:00.000Z	gogereaver	adam7	oh
2009-01-09T18:06:00.000Z	gogereaver	adam7	is it still relys on it but if not found it will just auto probe everything
2009-01-09T18:06:00.000Z	gogereaver	adam7	makes sence
2009-01-09T18:06:00.000Z	adam7	gogereaver	yeah, if you put it there, it will override, but it doesn't need it
2009-01-09T18:07:00.000Z	gogereaver	adam7	thats kinda a bad thing auto desent always work
2009-01-09T18:07:00.000Z	adam7	gogereaver	neither does xorg.conf IME
2009-01-09T18:15:00.000Z	adam7	gogereaver	but that was developed specifically for using cedega, so it makes sense that it would run well
2009-01-09T18:21:00.000Z	adam7	gogereaver	newer versions of Ubuntu have used less resources then older versions. It's improvement :)
