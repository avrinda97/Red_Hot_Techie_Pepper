2008-08-11T15:27:00.000Z	L		Well...
2008-08-11T15:28:00.000Z	L		Um...  It appears... there are no partitions to install to.
2008-08-11T15:28:00.000Z	L		No partitions at all...
2008-08-11T15:29:00.000Z	L		I'm on my laptop.
2008-08-11T15:29:00.000Z	L		I'm actually helping a friend install it.
2008-08-11T15:29:00.000Z	L		His computer is basically screwed, and he's on XP.
2008-08-11T15:30:00.000Z	L		But, I'm fixing that problem.
2008-08-11T15:30:00.000Z	L		Is there a way to format the drive and install?
2008-08-11T15:30:00.000Z	L		With the live CD?
2008-08-11T15:31:00.000Z	L		Where, and ... how?
2008-08-11T15:31:00.000Z	DozedOnLinux	L	is ther another Operating System on the laptop ? if not , yes the installation will create all needed partition
2008-08-11T15:31:00.000Z	DozedOnLinux	L	ok i see that now.
2008-08-11T15:32:00.000Z	DozedOnLinux	L	if you wish to completely overwrite all that is on the computers drives, the LiveCd can do that for you
2008-08-11T15:49:00.000Z	DozedOnLinux	L	then what section are you looking at now ?
2008-08-11T15:53:00.000Z	DozedOnLinux	L	you said going back goes nowhere, i dont believe that it goes "nowhere"
2008-08-11T16:21:00.000Z	DozedOnLinux	L	there may very well be a difference in the version of the install, as the one on the ubuntu site looks somewhat different, and i dont know why
2008-08-11T16:22:00.000Z	DozedOnLinux	L	 if that helps any , that is good. choose install right from the very beginning. might have better luck or possibly choose to install with AlternateCd as suggest by someone else
2008-08-11T16:23:00.000Z	DozedOnLinux	L	ok
2008-08-11T16:26:00.000Z	DozedOnLinux	L	ok, that can help some situations, for sure
2008-08-11T16:32:00.000Z	DozedOnLinux	L	had there been a previous OS on that system ?
2008-08-11T16:37:00.000Z	DozedOnLinux	L	as suggested, you may need to use the AlternateCD, but it seems to come down to , the IDE controller may not be completely compatible with this version of Linux(Kernel). if the AltCD doesnt work, then Ubuntu may not be an option for that system (MB)
2008-08-11T16:40:00.000Z	DozedOnLinux	L	for future reference there is a compatibility page for Hardware  https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupport
2008-08-11T16:48:00.000Z	DozedOnLinux	L	any luck ? i searched for possible solutions to the (intramfs and busybox), it may work, it may not
2008-08-11T16:49:00.000Z	DozedOnLinux	L	ok
