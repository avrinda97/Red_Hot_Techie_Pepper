2012-05-20T11:42:00.000Z	c4pt	Zallx	i am trying to run two sound cards at the same time onboard sound and sb x-fi sound
2012-05-20T11:42:00.000Z	c4pt	Zallx	if i put the sb x-fi card into my computer my intel hda disappears from lspci and the system
2012-05-20T11:42:00.000Z	Zallx		i need a webshare or viewer for tvtuner .... for my phone so i can watch tv always
2012-05-20T11:43:00.000Z	c4pt	Zallx	if i take the card out (if i take out the sb x-fi) my intel hda audio is back
2012-05-20T11:43:00.000Z	Zallx	c4pt	best guess is to add virtual mixers ?
2012-05-20T11:44:00.000Z	Zallx		why 2 soundcards ?
2012-05-20T11:44:00.000Z	c4pt	Zallx	but why does it disappear from lspci -vvv ?
2012-05-20T11:44:00.000Z	c4pt	Zallx	one card for parallels extreme (virtualization)
2012-05-20T11:44:00.000Z	Zallx	c4pt	becuz onboard is disabsled when offboard is attached is my best guess
2012-05-20T11:44:00.000Z	c4pt	Zallx	so how can i resolve it ?
2012-05-20T11:44:00.000Z	c4pt	Zallx	i would really like both cards to be used
2012-05-20T11:45:00.000Z	Zallx		u need to rewrite the driver so it doesnt disable
2012-05-20T11:45:00.000Z	c4pt	Zallx	it shows the video card hdmi audio and usb audio
2012-05-20T11:45:00.000Z	Zallx		or add a AlwaysEnableOnboard.sh
2012-05-20T11:45:00.000Z	Zallx		to re-enable it after its disabled ?
2012-05-20T11:46:00.000Z	Zallx		then add that to bashrc
2012-05-20T11:46:00.000Z	c4pt	Zallx	i could write the .sh i just dont understand how to re enable it right now
2012-05-20T11:46:00.000Z	c4pt	Zallx	if i wanted to re enable my snd hda intel what should i do ? with the snd-ctxfi running ?
2012-05-20T11:47:00.000Z	Zallx		lscpi needs to take a discision when 2 audio devices are connected
2012-05-20T11:47:00.000Z	Zallx		witch is master witch will be disabled
2012-05-20T11:50:00.000Z	c4pt	Zallx	 can i pm?
