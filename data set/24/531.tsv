2011-07-03T16:01:00.000Z	histo	wardriver	kismet probably can be configured to accomplish that.
2011-07-03T16:02:00.000Z	histo	wardriver	they have sounds for different things in the .conf
2011-07-03T16:02:00.000Z	wardriver	histo	which .conf?
2011-07-03T16:02:00.000Z	histo	wardriver	kismet.conf
2011-07-03T16:03:00.000Z	wardriver	histo	I just installed kismet 10 minutes ago  but all I see is that wireshark was installed.
2011-07-03T16:03:00.000Z	wardriver	histo	HOw do I start and use kismet?
2011-07-03T16:03:00.000Z	histo	wardriver	kismet is a console app doesn't have a gui
2011-07-03T16:03:00.000Z	wardriver	histo	 ahh
2011-07-03T16:03:00.000Z	histo	wardriver	most likely you have to edit the config before starting it.
2011-07-03T16:04:00.000Z	wardriver	histo	where is it located?
2011-07-03T16:04:00.000Z	histo	wardriver	/etc/kismet*
2011-07-03T16:04:00.000Z	wardriver	histo	thx
2011-07-03T16:04:00.000Z	histo	wardriver	http://www.ubuntugeek.com/kismet-an-802-11-wireless-network-detector-sniffer-and-intrusion-detection-system.html#more-1776
2011-07-03T16:05:00.000Z	wardriver	histo	thx a lot
2011-07-03T16:06:00.000Z	wardriver	histo	the kismet.conf is completely empty.
2011-07-03T16:07:00.000Z	wardriver	histo	sudo gedit /etc/kismet/kismet.conf ?
2011-07-03T16:08:00.000Z	histo	wardriver	yeah or insert editor of your choice.
2011-07-03T16:12:00.000Z	wardriver	histo	There are a few sound options in the conf file. But which open would enable a sound when an unprotected WLAN is found?
2011-07-03T16:12:00.000Z	histo	wardriver	idk you'd have to read through the options. I don't hav ethe config infront of me.
2011-07-03T16:13:00.000Z	histo	wardriver	there is kismet_ui.conf as well.
2011-07-03T16:41:00.000Z	wardriver	histo	 I have set the source to: source=BCM4727,eth1,Broadcom
2011-07-03T16:42:00.000Z	wardriver	histo	but I am getting Unknown capture source type 'BCM4727' in source 'BCM4727,eth1,Broadcom' Done.
2011-07-03T16:42:00.000Z	histo	wardriver	looking at other peoples configs I think the alert sound is what you want or something similar. I'm not sure it's been a while since i've used kismet
2011-07-03T16:42:00.000Z	histo	wardriver	there is a readme that shows different sources what to put.
