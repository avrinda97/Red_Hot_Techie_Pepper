2008-08-04T14:53:00.000Z	moDumass		im following that walkthrough step by step
2008-08-04T14:55:00.000Z	TerrorBite	moDumass	is it MAKEFILE in all capitals, or is it "Makefile" with just a capital M?
2008-08-04T14:56:00.000Z	moDumass	TerrorBite	just the first letter is a caps
2008-08-04T14:56:00.000Z	TerrorBite	moDumass	that's how it's supposed to be then
2008-08-04T14:56:00.000Z	moDumass	TerrorBite	the instructions say to cd to the dir
2008-08-04T14:57:00.000Z	TerrorBite	moDumass	yes, that means you need to type "cd path/to/directory" replacing path/to/directory with the path to the folder you want
2008-08-04T14:57:00.000Z	moDumass	TerrorBite	then            ./configure            and then            make         and then         make install   , but when i do it says no make file found
2008-08-04T14:57:00.000Z	TerrorBite	moDumass	did the ./configure part work?
2008-08-04T14:58:00.000Z	TerrorBite	moDumass	then the make part ought to work as well
2008-08-04T14:59:00.000Z	moDumass	TerrorBite	http://pastebin.com/m14845145 this is whats happenin
2008-08-04T15:00:00.000Z	TerrorBite	moDumass	if you'd read the output of ./configure you'd see it complaining
2008-08-04T15:01:00.000Z	moDumass	TerrorBite	im on it, sorry dont really know enough yet
2008-08-04T15:01:00.000Z	TerrorBite	moDumass	I suggest trying: sudo apt-get install libxtst-dev
2008-08-04T15:02:00.000Z	TerrorBite	moDumass	everything there was fine until line 53: "Can not link with Xtst /usr/lib/libXtst.so library!"
