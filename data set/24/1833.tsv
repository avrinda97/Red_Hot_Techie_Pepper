2009-07-31T02:02:00.000Z	oly562		and also the fbsd box, and all my other servers
2009-07-31T02:03:00.000Z	oly562		question: i can not ping 192.168.200.71, or 103, but from a windoze server, and a freebsd server, i can ping both .71, and 103. now, all of these are on the same network, including my laptop. and I can NOT ping .71, and 103 from this computer. I can also telnet from the windoze box, and the freebsd server with both ip's.  Why can I NOT ping nor telnet to the wireless printer server?  This laptop is wireless, and the windoze and freebsd
