2009-05-28T05:50:00.000Z	TwoToneSpirit		I have a friend who aborted the Jaunty upgrade in the middle and now has no keyboard or mouse functionality in X.  He can CTRL-ALT-F2 to get to a terminal.  ifconfig shows no network adapters, just the loopback.  I have googled and found others in the same boat, but no solutions short of completely reinstalling.  I'd like to offer him some easier way, especially since he has many photos on his hard drive and no easy way to back
2009-05-28T05:50:00.000Z	TwoToneSpirit		 them up.  Advice?
2009-05-28T05:51:00.000Z	jdu	TwoToneSpirit	from the terminal, mount a drive to back up.  Probably you _could_ fix it, but it's best to just complete the install.
2009-05-28T05:52:00.000Z	TwoToneSpirit	jdu	 He doesn't have a drive to mount at the moment.
2009-05-28T05:53:00.000Z	jdu	TwoToneSpirit	ok.  use a remote copy program such as scp to copy everything to another computer then.
2009-05-28T05:53:00.000Z	jdu	TwoToneSpirit	that assumes you can get ethernet working.
2009-05-28T05:54:00.000Z	TwoToneSpirit	jdu	 Yeah, it would be wonderful if we could get ethernet working - then I could SSH in and have a look myself, plus obviously we could back stuff up offsite.
2009-05-28T05:54:00.000Z	TwoToneSpirit	jdu	 Any advice on getting his network card to work?
2009-05-28T05:54:00.000Z	jdu	TwoToneSpirit	is NetworkManager running?
2009-05-28T05:55:00.000Z	TwoToneSpirit	jdu	 how to tell?  ps ax |grep something?
2009-05-28T05:55:00.000Z	jdu	TwoToneSpirit	grep NetworkManager I assume.
2009-05-28T05:56:00.000Z	jdu	TwoToneSpirit	basically, if it is not, you want to add a line for eth0 in /etc/network/interfaces  Currently only lo will be in there.
2009-05-28T05:58:00.000Z	jdu	TwoToneSpirit	or really, several lines starting with auto eth0          which will bring eth0 up.
2009-05-28T06:02:00.000Z	TwoToneSpirit	jdu	 where to add eth0?  /etc/network/interfaces has two lines: "auto lo" and "iface lo inet loopback"
2009-05-28T06:02:00.000Z	jdu	TwoToneSpirit	man interfaces
2009-05-28T06:02:00.000Z	TwoToneSpirit	jdu	man interfaces?
2009-05-28T06:02:00.000Z	TwoToneSpirit	jdu	 I looked at my own file, and it's the same as his, but of course my network driver is working fine.
2009-05-28T06:02:00.000Z	jdu	TwoToneSpirit	the manual page
2009-05-28T06:03:00.000Z	jdu	TwoToneSpirit	yes, the file is generally only used for lo, NetworkManager handles the rest.  However, the system isn't working; you can add other lines and bring up those interfaces.
2009-05-28T06:04:00.000Z	jdu	TwoToneSpirit	the interfaces(5) manual page has some info as well various websites.
2009-05-28T06:05:00.000Z	jdu	TwoToneSpirit	so:   auto eth0         next line: iface eth0 inet dhcp      would be a simple setup.
2009-05-28T06:06:00.000Z	TwoToneSpirit	jdu	 I just figured that out.  Thanks for validating my thoughts.  :-)
2009-05-28T06:07:00.000Z	jdu	TwoToneSpirit	its been a while since I've messed with that.  You'll need to use ifup  to bring the interface up.
2009-05-28T06:49:00.000Z	TwoToneSpirit	jdu	 Thank you very much for the networking help - we eventually got it working and we're now SSHing and screening to work the rest out.
