2008-06-01T07:57:00.000Z	Gaming4JC		Thank you!
2008-06-01T07:57:00.000Z	Gaming4JC		let me see...
2008-06-01T07:59:00.000Z	Gaming4JC		just the repo
2008-06-01T07:59:00.000Z	Gaming4JC		I need the compiler deb for it
2008-06-01T08:00:00.000Z	Gaming4JC		ok
2008-06-01T08:00:00.000Z	Gaming4JC		but 'em
2008-06-01T08:00:00.000Z	Gaming4JC		how do I get online to that in Ubuntu without a modem, Flannel?
2008-06-01T08:00:00.000Z	Gaming4JC		ok...
2008-06-01T08:00:00.000Z	cellofellow	Gaming4JC	download packages to a thumbdrive and install manually with dpkg.
2008-06-01T08:01:00.000Z	cellofellow	Gaming4JC	nah, just go to packages.ubuntu.com and you can download packages from there.
2008-06-01T08:01:00.000Z	Gaming4JC	cellofellow	I have Hoary. Doesn't exist there.
2008-06-01T08:22:00.000Z	cellofellow	Gaming4JC	yes, there's a Shared Folders feature for sharing files from guest to host.
2008-06-01T08:26:00.000Z	cellofellow	Gaming4JC	nope
2008-06-01T08:28:00.000Z	cellofellow	Gaming4JC	Cedega and CrossOver Games apparently have wider Direct3D support.
2008-06-01T08:29:00.000Z	cellofellow	Gaming4JC	That attitude is a little misconstrued. I think Linux ought to be Free but not neccarily free. (as in libre and gratis).
2008-06-01T08:44:00.000Z	cellofellow	Gaming4JC	yes, actually
2008-06-01T08:44:00.000Z	cellofellow	Gaming4JC	you can upgrade Ubuntu from the next-versions CD
2008-06-01T08:44:00.000Z	cellofellow	Gaming4JC	not the LiveCD, just the Alternate.
2008-06-01T08:45:00.000Z	cellofellow	Gaming4JC	it acts as a repo
2008-06-01T08:45:00.000Z	cellofellow	Gaming4JC	well, with Dapper they split into the "Desktop" Live CD and the "Alternate" text-install CD.
2008-06-01T08:47:00.000Z	cellofellow	Gaming4JC	download or buy or borrow a Breezy CD and upgrade from it.
2008-06-01T08:47:00.000Z	cellofellow	Gaming4JC	and then you can do the same with Dapper, and from there to Hardy.
