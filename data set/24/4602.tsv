2007-04-09T07:34:00.000Z	kingcobra		what are the options you need in fstab for a usb hd partition to mount at startup with full permissions for me and not just root
2007-04-09T07:35:00.000Z	foutrelis	kingcobra	Checking..
2007-04-09T07:35:00.000Z	kingcobra		i have looked at man mount and in lots of ubuntu docs but cant figure it out exactly
2007-04-09T07:35:00.000Z	kingcobra	foutrelis	thanks very much
2007-04-09T07:36:00.000Z	foutrelis	kingcobra	For me it's: /media/hda1 ntfs umask=222,utf8 0 1
2007-04-09T07:36:00.000Z	foutrelis	kingcobra	So I think that umask=222 does the trick :)
2007-04-09T07:38:00.000Z	kingcobra	foutrelis	ok ill try that
2007-04-09T07:38:00.000Z	foutrelis	kingcobra	If it doesn't work just come back again and someone more experienced than me will be able to help you further.
2007-04-09T07:38:00.000Z	kingcobra	foutrelis	do you know what happens if you turn on the comp without the usb hd on and then turn it on later
2007-04-09T07:39:00.000Z	foutrelis	kingcobra	It should auto-mount I think.
2007-04-09T07:39:00.000Z	kingcobra	foutrelis	thanks for helping
2007-04-09T07:39:00.000Z	foutrelis	kingcobra	You're welcome.
2007-04-09T07:40:00.000Z	kingcobra	foutrelis	i thought you were reading this from your fstab no?
2007-04-09T07:40:00.000Z	foutrelis	kingcobra	I read my /etc/fstab for that umask=222 option.
2007-04-09T07:41:00.000Z	kingcobra	foutrelis	oh right but your not sure what happens with a usb hd?
2007-04-09T07:41:00.000Z	foutrelis	kingcobra	Is Ubuntu installed on the external usb hd?
2007-04-09T07:41:00.000Z	kingcobra	foutrelis	it works for your internal hd partition
2007-04-09T07:41:00.000Z	kingcobra	foutrelis	no
2007-04-09T07:42:00.000Z	foutrelis	kingcobra	Hmmm. When you plug in your usb hd what happens?
2007-04-09T07:42:00.000Z	kingcobra	foutrelis	at the moment nothing
2007-04-09T07:43:00.000Z	foutrelis	kingcobra	My usb flash disks get recognized when I plug them in. I have not tried a hd though.
2007-04-09T07:44:00.000Z	kingcobra	foutrelis	sure ill try the 222 thanx very much
2007-04-09T07:44:00.000Z	foutrelis	kingcobra	You're welcome. I wish I could help further.
2007-04-09T07:45:00.000Z	kingcobra	foutrelis	 tis ok
