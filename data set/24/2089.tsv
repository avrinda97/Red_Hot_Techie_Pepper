2009-07-01T22:45:00.000Z	Drknezz	coleys	how can i check for it?
2009-07-01T22:44:00.000Z	coleys	Drknezz	first off kubuntu is halfass implmenation of KDE, second... Is hal going?
2009-07-01T22:44:00.000Z	Drknezz	coleys	HAL?
2009-07-01T22:44:00.000Z	Drknezz	coleys	the Hw abstraction layer?
2009-07-01T22:44:00.000Z	coleys	Drknezz	Hardware Abstraction Layer.
2009-07-01T22:44:00.000Z	Drknezz	coleys	why wouldn't it ever be running anyways, isn't it essential?
2009-07-01T22:45:00.000Z	coleys	Drknezz	It could be erroring or something. And No its not essential if you know what your doing.
2009-07-01T22:46:00.000Z	coleys	Drknezz	sudo /etc/init.d/hald restart
2009-07-01T22:46:00.000Z	Drknezz	coleys	when the X-error ggtk dialog popped up, the mouse worked correctly, but when i finally could log in to kde, the mosue was still all time, no matter what i did, but when i boot back into Ubuntu's stock kernel, it works
2009-07-01T22:48:00.000Z	coleys	Drknezz	How did you install kde? Via kubuntu liveCD or... apt-get?
2009-07-01T22:48:00.000Z	Drknezz	coleys	kubuntu liveCD
2009-07-01T22:48:00.000Z	coleys	Drknezz	and your mouse isn't a touchpad right?
2009-07-01T22:48:00.000Z	Drknezz	coleys	this is pure kubuntu, not ubuntu conversion, i came here because #kubuntu is a ghost town
2009-07-01T22:48:00.000Z	Drknezz	coleys	it's a desktop
2009-07-01T22:49:00.000Z	coleys	Drknezz	Okay. And Yeah..Kubuntu is a ghosttown =P hmm..
2009-07-01T22:50:00.000Z	coleys	Drknezz	Im not really sure... Honestly it should be working.
2009-07-01T22:51:00.000Z	Drknezz	coleys	i'd say i didnt compile a certain module, but i had a functional mouse on gtk dialog :S
2009-07-01T22:51:00.000Z	coleys	Drknezz	Yeah thats what doesn't make sense. =p
2009-07-01T22:52:00.000Z	Drknezz	coleys	kde depends on hal for mouse stuff?
2009-07-01T22:53:00.000Z	coleys	Drknezz	Everything depends on HAL =P
2009-07-01T22:53:00.000Z	Drknezz	coleys	so, how did gtk took control of mouse?
2009-07-01T22:54:00.000Z	coleys	Drknezz	I don't have a clue, I don't trust kubuntu myself =P
2009-07-01T22:54:00.000Z	Drknezz	coleys	lol
2009-07-01T22:56:00.000Z	coleys	Drknezz	Check msgs. !>
