2005-12-14T13:25:00.000Z	perdidopunk		so i took my boot disk and put it on the motherboard ide slot
2005-12-14T13:25:00.000Z	perdidopunk		but still no dice
2005-12-14T13:25:00.000Z	perdidopunk		well
2005-12-14T13:25:00.000Z	perdidopunk		i made sure to build all the drivers i needed into the kernel
2005-12-14T13:25:00.000Z	perdidopunk		but
2005-12-14T13:25:00.000Z	perdidopunk		kernel panics nonetheless
2005-12-14T13:26:00.000Z	perdidopunk		apparently anything pci express ?
2005-12-14T13:27:00.000Z	perdidopunk		here's my specs: athlon 64 venice core, asus k8v-e deluxe mobo, radeon x1800xt, sil 0680 pci raid host controller with a striped set (that's windows though), 2 maxtor drives on the mobo ide bus
2005-12-14T13:27:00.000Z	perdidopunk		erm, i also have a firewire soundcard, but i'm not worrying about that at this point...
2005-12-14T13:27:00.000Z	perdidopunk		i'm upset that it installed drivers for my freaking webcam but i can't seem to get it to read the hard disks correctly
2005-12-14T13:28:00.000Z	bob2_	perdidopunk	what in particular is not working?
2005-12-14T13:28:00.000Z	bob2_	perdidopunk	you need to take ten steps back and tell us what on earth is going on
2005-12-14T13:28:00.000Z	bob2_	perdidopunk	is some piece of hardware not working?
2005-12-14T13:28:00.000Z	bob2_	perdidopunk	in what way is it not working? what do you think it should be doing?
2005-12-14T13:28:00.000Z	bob2_	perdidopunk	when using the default ubuntu kernel?
2005-12-14T13:28:00.000Z	bob2_	perdidopunk	then use the ubuntu default, and tell us what happens
2005-12-14T13:30:00.000Z	bob2_	perdidopunk	does lspci list the device?
2005-12-14T13:30:00.000Z	bob2_	perdidopunk	so boot back into the ubuntu kernel
2005-12-14T13:31:00.000Z	bob2_	perdidopunk	uh, go find a boot cd
2005-12-14T13:32:00.000Z	bob2_	perdidopunk	alt-f2
2005-12-14T13:34:00.000Z	bob2_	perdidopunk	and you're hitting alt-f2 when?
2005-12-14T13:34:00.000Z	bob2_	perdidopunk	then boot the installer
2005-12-14T13:39:00.000Z	bob2_	perdidopunk	you need to mount them, I have no idea what device your / was
2005-12-14T13:40:00.000Z	bob2_	perdidopunk	perhaps those modules aren't loaded until you get the partitioning stage of the installer
