2010-04-28T16:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Taev	 lsb_release -a
2010-06-20T16:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Taev	 short answeer . you dont. use 'sudo and gksudo' as needed to do admin/root tasks
2010-06-20T16:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Taev	 theres no need to. use sudo as needed.
2010-07-04T13:24:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Taev	 odd.. its not crashed once on me.
2010-07-04T13:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Taev	 redownloaded?  from teh firefox web site?
2010-07-04T13:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Taev	 i thought the new version only got installed if you had backports enabled also.
2010-07-04T13:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Taev	 yes.
2010-07-04T13:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Taev	 its best to use the package manager. not downloading stuff from teh FF web site. that may be the core of your whole problem
2010-07-04T13:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Taev	 run synaptic, search for firefox,  use package -> force version   menu item
2010-07-04T13:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Taev	 theres other packages that it may alwo need. so its 'best' to use synaptic. to downgrade the version
2010-07-04T13:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Taev	 if you 'installed' firefox from teh firefox download page. You may need to remove that. or you may be accidently running that version
2010-07-04T13:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Taev	 if you truely insrtalled ff 3.6.3 - then it is downloaded to the /var/cache/apt dir
2010-07-04T13:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Taev	 if you did use synaptic to install teh older version just now - it would be saved in   /var/cache/apt/archives
2010-07-04T14:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Taev	 try running 'firefox' from the terminal and see if it runs
2010-07-04T14:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Taev	 so 'firefox' now gives a 'command not found' ?
2010-07-04T14:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Taev	 so all this time i just crashes on ONE site?
2010-07-04T14:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Taev	 you could also try gettting the packages from antoehr source/repository - it could be the .deb you are downloaading has some issues.
2010-07-04T14:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Taev	 write a dirty letter to adobe. Its a bug in flash i would say
2010-07-04T15:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Taev	 you dont want gnash and flash both installed normally
2010-07-04T15:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Taev	 ./configure? You are trying to compuild gplflash?
