2011-05-21T09:27:00.000Z	yigal	doc|home	#compiz
2011-05-21T09:27:00.000Z	yigal	doc|home	seriously if I wasn't so drunk I'd tell you but it's in ccsm
2011-05-21T09:29:00.000Z	doc|home	yigal	is that something I need to install? I can't find anything that seems to relate in any menu or command line tool
2011-05-21T09:30:00.000Z	yigal	doc|home	it should be installed default, ccsm on a terminal if you are comfortable
2011-05-21T09:30:00.000Z	doc|home	yigal	sudo: ccsm: command not found
2011-05-21T09:31:00.000Z	yigal	doc|home	ok then, sudo apt-get install ccsm
2011-05-21T09:32:00.000Z	yigal	doc|home	it's just a way to control compiz which is the default window manager
2011-05-21T09:33:00.000Z	doc|home	yigal	E: Unable to locate package ccsm same for compiz-config-settings-manager
