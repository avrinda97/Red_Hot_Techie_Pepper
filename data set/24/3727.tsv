2009-05-22T05:11:00.000Z	bc	WindowSmasher	your disks might be slow for some reason. check hdparam
2009-05-22T05:12:00.000Z	bc	WindowSmasher	sorry, make that hdparm
2009-05-22T05:13:00.000Z	WindowSmasher	bc	I don't understand what I'm looking at (hdparm output)
2009-05-22T05:14:00.000Z	bc	WindowSmasher	sudo hdparm -i /dev/sdc | grep udma (replace sdc with your disk)
2009-05-22T05:14:00.000Z	bc	WindowSmasher	the mode with the * by it is currently in use
2009-05-22T05:15:00.000Z	WindowSmasher	bc	sorry. you lost me
2009-05-22T05:16:00.000Z	bc	WindowSmasher	did you run that command in a terminal? check out the manpage for hdparm

2009-05-22T05:17:00.000Z	bc	WindowSmasher	I guess disk isn't the problem. video maybe? hard to tell

2009-05-22T05:17:00.000Z	bc	WindowSmasher	cross disk I/O off your list. no idea where to go from here. what video card?
2009-05-22T05:18:00.000Z	bc	WindowSmasher	using nvidia's own driver, or default nvidia in Xorg?
2009-05-22T05:19:00.000Z	WindowSmasher	bc	I have a couple of questionable things happening
2009-05-22T05:19:00.000Z	bc	WindowSmasher	no more ideas here. I guess it depends on how slow it actually is.
