2005-10-01T11:25:00.000Z	bob2	adjacent	dude
2005-10-01T11:02:00.000Z	bob2	adjacent	sure it's not because you're using backports?
2005-10-01T11:02:00.000Z	adjacent	bob2	im sure it is
2005-10-01T11:17:00.000Z	bob2	adjacent	what are you doing?
2005-10-01T11:17:00.000Z	bob2	adjacent	what are you doing?
2005-10-01T11:17:00.000Z	adjacent	bob2	trying to fix firefox since i think a backport ate it
2005-10-01T11:17:00.000Z	bob2	adjacent	that's not really answering my question
2005-10-01T11:18:00.000Z	bob2	adjacent	are you upgrading to breezy? getting hoary-security updates?
2005-10-01T11:18:00.000Z	adjacent	bob2	i am running apt-get upgrade
2005-10-01T11:18:00.000Z	bob2	adjacent	just paste your /etc/apt/sources.list to #flood then
2005-10-01T11:18:00.000Z	bob2	adjacent	no
2005-10-01T11:19:00.000Z	adjacent	bob2	why do i need to paste them? its just main, multiverse, universe
2005-10-01T11:19:00.000Z	bob2	adjacent	because you failed to answer my question
2005-10-01T11:21:00.000Z	adjacent	bob2	its all up there if you scroll. ill repaste if youd like thogh
2005-10-01T11:22:00.000Z	bob2	adjacent	there's no menion of he nick "adjacent" in #flood in the past day
2005-10-01T11:23:00.000Z	adjacent	bob2	there is probably no mention of adjacent in #flood ever
2005-10-01T11:23:00.000Z	adjacent	bob2	but thanks anyway
2005-10-01T11:23:00.000Z	bob2	adjacent	anyway, nalioth's answer may or may not be dangerous, depending on what you're trying to do
2005-10-01T11:24:00.000Z	adjacent	bob2	just what i said.... restore firefox to a working state after an upgrade from backports
2005-10-01T11:45:00.000Z	bob2	adjacent	that command isn't going to do anything useful
2005-10-01T11:45:00.000Z	bob2	adjacent	paste the output of "sudo apt-get dist-upgrade"
2005-10-01T11:46:00.000Z	bob2	adjacent	sudo dpkg --purge --force-depends firefox firefox-gnome-support; sudo apt-get install mozilla-firefox mozilla-firefox-gnome-support
2005-10-01T11:47:00.000Z	adjacent	bob2	so... just what i was doing, but through dpkg instead of apt?
2005-10-01T11:47:00.000Z	bob2	adjacent	ok...
