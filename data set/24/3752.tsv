2009-06-20T19:31:00.000Z	NorthByNorthWest		Hi all! Trying to mount a shared folder but I get "Failed to mount Windows-share" why? Its shared on a Ubuntu Server using webmin... cant figure out how to fix! Please help!
2009-06-20T19:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	NorthByNorthWest	 use the 'findsmb' command to be sure its actually shared.. and  tell the channel the exact command you are using to mount the 'share'
2009-06-20T19:34:00.000Z	NorthByNorthWest	Dr_Willis	findsmb at the server?
2009-06-20T19:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	NorthByNorthWest	 or any box. it scans the network
2009-06-20T19:36:00.000Z	NorthByNorthWest	Dr_Willis	well... it finds the server and lists its IP and netbios name, both on the server and client!
2009-06-20T19:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	NorthByNorthWest	 then your mount command may be in error.
2009-06-20T19:37:00.000Z	NorthByNorthWest	Dr_Willis	well, I only double click the folder in nautilus
2009-06-20T19:37:00.000Z	NorthByNorthWest	Dr_Willis	should i try to mountit in a terminal?
2009-06-20T19:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	NorthByNorthWest	 thats not 'mounting' the share.. thats using the nautilus file manager to 'browse' the share..  to DIFFERNT ways to get to the same thing.
2009-06-20T19:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	NorthByNorthWest	 in the file manager try typing in the full address to the server/share.  or try to actually mount it from the command line.
2009-06-20T19:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	NorthByNorthWest	 for example. - my fileserver -->   smb://black/public1/     (on some box's i have to enter the full path the first time, then it rembers, or i bookmark them)
2009-06-20T19:47:00.000Z	NorthByNorthWest	Dr_Willis	entering the path, in my case 'smb://ec-server/ecshare' makes nautilius try for a little while. then a message windows pops up saying (translated from swedish) "Error: Failed to mount Windows-share. Choose another browser/viewer and try again"
2009-06-20T19:48:00.000Z	NorthByNorthWest	Dr_Willis	seems more like a misconfigured samba share at the server??
2009-06-20T19:49:00.000Z	NorthByNorthWest	Dr_Willis	sudo mount -t smbfs smb://ec-server/ecshare /mnt/ec says "wrong file system, wrong flag, wrong super block"
2009-07-02T02:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	NorthByNorthWest	:  i make a 'script' on the desktop. 2 lines.  #!/bin/bash     then, command_to_run  , make it executable.. i click on it.. it asks to view/runin terminal, or run.. 'run' runs it.
2009-07-02T02:19:00.000Z	NorthByNorthWest	Dr_Willis	yeah, but I want to run three programs... after the first porgram is run it doesnt start the other two...
2009-07-02T02:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	NorthByNorthWest	 whats the exact script you are using then? pastebin it.. sounds like ascript issue to me.
2009-07-02T02:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	NorthByNorthWest	 for 3 programs.. it would be #!/bin/bash       command1 &             command2  &    cmmand 3 &
2009-07-02T02:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	NorthByNorthWest	 4 lines total)
2009-07-02T02:20:00.000Z	NorthByNorthWest	Dr_Willis	at the moment its: http://pastebin.com/mf26a7ea
2009-07-02T02:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	NorthByNorthWest	 do it  on 3 seperate lines.. and try with a simpiler test case perhaps
2009-07-02T02:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	NorthByNorthWest	 pastebinit  test.sh
2009-07-02T02:24:00.000Z	NorthByNorthWest	Dr_Willis	oh yeah! that did it! THANKS! :)
2009-07-02T02:24:00.000Z	NorthByNorthWest	Dr_Willis	now... next step then, can I do something so I dont have to select "Run in terminal / Run / View" when doubleclicking the icon?
