2008-04-27T08:13:00.000Z	somethingcomplex		Hi, I'm trying to continue downloading something in BitTorrent (after rebooting) and it's asking me to open location of meta file. I think this means the .torrent file, but I can't find it. It was downloaded to /tmp, but it's not there anymore. Help?
2008-04-27T08:14:00.000Z	unperson	somethingcomplex	I think if you went and downloaded a new copy of the torrent file that would suffice, but I'm not sure.
2008-04-27T08:14:00.000Z	unperson	somethingcomplex	I can tell you this:
2008-04-27T08:16:00.000Z	unperson	somethingcomplex	I downloaded the ISO directly from a mirror.  Later I decided to share the wealth by running bittorrent to "download" the file I already had.  I downloaded the torrent file to the same directory as the ISO and then invoked btdownloadcurses just like I was downloading it fresh and that worked fine.
2008-04-27T08:17:00.000Z	unperson	somethingcomplex	You mean you can't find the torrent file you downloaded.
2008-04-27T08:17:00.000Z	somethingcomplex	unperson	...what?
2008-04-27T08:18:00.000Z	unperson	somethingcomplex	You downloaded the .torrent file again, but now you can't find it on your HD?
2008-04-27T08:18:00.000Z	somethingcomplex	unperson	I guess I mean the filepath indicated in the download status bar is wrong. It's just not where it says it is. It's not hidden, either
2008-04-27T08:18:00.000Z	somethingcomplex	unperson	either that, or i'm crazy
2008-04-27T08:19:00.000Z	unperson	somethingcomplex	Could be both.  ;-)
2008-04-27T08:19:00.000Z	unperson	somethingcomplex	Anyway, can you try saving it somewhere else, somewhere like your Desktop?
2008-04-27T08:19:00.000Z	unperson	somethingcomplex	You should be able to specify by right-clicking on the link for the .torrent file and choosing save as
2008-04-27T08:19:00.000Z	somethingcomplex	unperson	it doesn't give me an option to download it anywhere else.. i will see if i can change the default
2008-04-27T08:20:00.000Z	somethingcomplex	unperson	oh!
2008-04-27T08:21:00.000Z	unperson	somethingcomplex	Wait, was firefox just downloading the file or was it opening a bittorrent client automatically?
2008-04-27T08:21:00.000Z	unperson	somethingcomplex	Because AFAIK the default behavior when it downloads is to put stuff in the Desktop directory, not /tmp.
2008-04-27T08:21:00.000Z	somethingcomplex	unperson	I tried both
2008-04-27T08:22:00.000Z	unperson	somethingcomplex	If it's spawning a bittorrent client then I think it'll usually put the torrent file in /tmp.
2008-04-27T08:22:00.000Z	unperson	somethingcomplex	I personally find that behavior of firefox annoying, but sais la vie, I guess.
2008-04-27T08:25:00.000Z	unperson	somethingcomplex	What client are you trying to use now?
2008-04-27T08:25:00.000Z	unperson	somethingcomplex	(I may have missed that part earlier)
2008-04-27T08:26:00.000Z	somethingcomplex	unperson	BitTorrent
2008-04-27T08:28:00.000Z	unperson	somethingcomplex	I see.  So now you've got the .torrent file but you can't get it to resume the download?
2008-04-27T08:30:00.000Z	somethingcomplex	unperson	nope. .torrent file still lying about its whereabouts. nevermind, though; uTorrent is much easier to use.
