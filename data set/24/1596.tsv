2009-11-05T09:08:00.000Z	Dravekx		ok.. I have 2 hard disks, each 160GB on a Dell poweredge T105. is there anything special I need to load ubuntu server?
2009-11-05T09:10:00.000Z	scunizi	Dravekx	to make things easier.. check the wiring of each drive to the motherboard.. make sure that drive 1 is in the drive1 slot on the motherboard and the same for drive 2.. then make sure your boot order is in sequence for the drives.. it will work reguardless but sometimes with 2 drives you'll install and then you end up reinstalling to boot loader to the right drive.
2009-11-05T09:11:00.000Z	Dravekx	scunizi	thx :)
2009-11-05T09:12:00.000Z	scunizi	Dravekx	np :)  remember server has no gui environment.. if you want it after install just "sudo apt-get install gnome or xfce4 or .. there's a million of them.. if you want the whole ubuntu desktop then sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
2009-11-05T09:24:00.000Z	scunizi	Dravekx	doesn't have to be
2009-11-05T09:31:00.000Z	scunizi	Dravekx	on a server the owner isn't putting much of anything in /home.. most stuff is off the root someplace.. like the web server and files.. databases in mysql etc.
2009-11-05T09:32:00.000Z	scunizi	Dravekx	encryption?
2009-11-05T09:32:00.000Z	Dravekx	scunizi	I just encrypted the home directory on login.
2009-11-05T09:32:00.000Z	scunizi	Dravekx	that's ok.. either way it works fine..
2009-11-05T09:35:00.000Z	scunizi	Dravekx	if this is a home server for experimentation.. auto updates
2009-11-05T09:35:00.000Z	Dravekx	scunizi	its for home business really.
2009-11-05T09:35:00.000Z	scunizi	Dravekx	same diff.. do the auto updates..
2009-11-05T09:38:00.000Z	Dravekx	scunizi	Im at the software selection and the core files are installed. should I add lamp from there or wait?
2009-11-05T09:39:00.000Z	scunizi	Dravekx	lamp is for a web server.. good for joomla, zimbra, other crm, erp's etc.. depends on what you want to do with the server.. what's your goals?
2009-11-05T09:43:00.000Z	scunizi	Dravekx	then lamp for the store and mythtv or xbmc (I think it's called) .. try googling for media server linux or ubuntu and you'll get some references..
2009-11-05T09:49:00.000Z	scunizi	Dravekx	vnc is graphical.. server is text based.. ssh is the way to get into it.
2009-11-05T09:50:00.000Z	scunizi	Dravekx	yep.. sudo apt-get install ssh .. and on the machine your accessing from do the same ..unless it's a windows machine then you have to install putty
2009-11-05T09:50:00.000Z	Dravekx	scunizi	thanks alot!!! You're a great help!
2009-11-05T09:51:00.000Z	scunizi	Dravekx	np :)
