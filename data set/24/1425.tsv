2010-01-22T17:57:00.000Z	storm1		hello guys
2010-01-22T17:57:00.000Z	storm1		my login doesn't work any longer
2010-01-22T17:57:00.000Z	storm1		can someone assist pls?
2010-01-22T17:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	storm1	 tell the channel what the ssytem is doing exactly. and where its not working at.
2010-01-22T17:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	storm1	 so either X or the Desktop is crashing. it seems.
2010-01-22T17:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	storm1	 can you login to the console?
2010-01-22T17:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	storm1	 that is weird.
2010-01-22T17:59:00.000Z	storm1	Dr_Willis	any idea, where to find some error msgs? it's a plain default installation with nothing special, only a few weeks old
2010-01-22T18:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	storm1	 as a test. try making a new user. see if it works for them.. if it does work for the new user. that would show its the old users settings somehow causing an issue
2010-01-22T18:01:00.000Z	storm1	Dr_Willis	that would mean loosing all my settings :(
2010-01-22T18:01:00.000Z	storm1	Dr_Willis	bad luck, eh?
2010-01-22T18:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	storm1	 no it would not.. it would mean you ADDED a new user to test...  :) you could then perhaps figure out what setting is causing an issue..
2010-01-22T18:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	storm1	 and remove/fix the setting
2010-01-22T18:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	storm1	 IF its a user setting..
2010-01-22T18:02:00.000Z	storm1	Dr_Willis	ok. i'll give it a try. brb
2010-01-22T18:05:00.000Z	storm1	Dr_Willis	new user works fine
2010-01-22T18:06:00.000Z	storm1	Dr_Willis	more ideas?
2010-01-22T18:08:00.000Z	storm1	Dr_Willis	which settings may cause that issue? how to filter that out?
2010-01-22T18:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	storm1	 no idea. I would start with disabling compiz -  it is often a problem
2010-01-22T18:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	storm1	  I normally dont worry about too many settings. and i often just clean out all the gnome settings to get back to defaults.
2010-01-22T18:10:00.000Z	storm1	Dr_Willis	maybe ...
2010-01-22T18:10:00.000Z	storm1	Dr_Willis	mompl
2010-01-22T18:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	storm1	 its very weird that the startx thing dosent crash also.  I wonder what its doing differntly
2010-01-22T18:12:00.000Z	storm1	Dr_Willis	ok. thx. my fault. wrong setting in .profile caused that issue. found out looking in xsession-errors. sorry for the time i've stolen ;)
