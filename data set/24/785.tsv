2011-04-06T12:18:00.000Z	Nisstyre		half the time it freezes, doesn't work
2011-04-06T12:18:00.000Z	Nisstyre		screws up CDs
2011-04-06T12:19:00.000Z	Nisstyre		How is it my "personal experience" ? Software bugs are subjective?
2011-04-06T12:21:00.000Z	Nisstyre		cdrecord, which is a cli tool, works perfectly
2011-04-06T12:21:00.000Z	Nisstyre		so it's not my hardware
2011-04-06T12:22:00.000Z	Nisstyre		the program just causes everything else to freeze whenever I burn a CD or blank a CD
2011-04-06T12:22:00.000Z	Nisstyre		cpu and memory usage aren't even high
2011-04-06T12:23:00.000Z	Nisstyre		and it's a terribly designed program anyway, since it requires you to eject a CD after you blank it, put it back in, then reload the program
2011-04-06T12:24:00.000Z	ohsix	Nisstyre	did you report bugs you'd found?
2011-04-06T12:24:00.000Z	Nisstyre	ohsix	I'd have to run it in gdb
2011-04-06T12:25:00.000Z	ohsix	Nisstyre	not really; you can do with reporting them first
2011-04-06T12:25:00.000Z	ohsix	Nisstyre	you should
2011-04-06T12:25:00.000Z	Nisstyre	ohsix	how would I report a bug with no information about it?
2011-04-06T12:27:00.000Z	ohsix	Nisstyre	and there are even burners where it plainly says, or accepts the command to act as if new media is in there, but doesn't, so making it only ask for the drives that require it is problematic
2011-04-06T12:27:00.000Z	ohsix	Nisstyre	as to getting information to figure out where the problem is, a program like brasero will have many verbosity options to describe all the operations it is doing
2011-04-06T12:28:00.000Z	Nisstyre	ohsix	that's okay, I'll have to get a blank cd to test though, because it only shows up when I burn or blank CDs
2011-04-06T12:28:00.000Z	ohsix	Nisstyre	what sort of job were you doing when it was doing what you describe?
2011-04-06T12:32:00.000Z	Nisstyre	ohsix	what does it use as a salt anyway?
2011-04-06T12:33:00.000Z	ohsix	Nisstyre	just random information, it's used to mix the original password; then included as the salt so it can be used in the future to check the encoded portion
2011-04-06T12:34:00.000Z	Nisstyre	ohsix	to prevent precomputation attacks I assume
2011-04-06T12:34:00.000Z	ohsix	Nisstyre	yep, since those bits are part of the information you need to generate the trials
2011-04-06T12:43:00.000Z	Nisstyre	ohsix	faster though isn't it? I mean, wouldn't it be safe if you were on a secure LAN?
2011-04-06T12:44:00.000Z	ohsix	Nisstyre	latency doesn't really dictate how fast something is, but yes it can be lower latency; the difference is almost nil
2011-04-06T12:44:00.000Z	Nisstyre	ohsix	fair enough, I've never done it before so...
