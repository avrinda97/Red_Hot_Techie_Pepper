2009-11-19T00:13:00.000Z	Yancho	DasEi	most files are on /home .. another physical hard disk
2009-11-19T00:13:00.000Z	Yancho	DasEi	before i did chroot i got internet
2009-11-19T00:13:00.000Z	DasEi	Yancho	confusing, after you said just one linux partition
2009-11-19T00:14:00.000Z	Yancho	DasEi	during the conversation i told u i have /home mounted elsewhere
2009-11-19T00:15:00.000Z	DasEi	Yancho	no further ideas for now, init is what you need back, or a reinstall (can keep exiting home)
2009-11-19T00:16:00.000Z	Yancho	DasEi	if i dont chroot can i get internet ?
2009-11-19T00:16:00.000Z	DasEi	Yancho	obviously, but changes then occur just in the live cd, not the (hd-) system
2009-11-19T00:17:00.000Z	Yancho		i see DasEi
2009-11-19T00:17:00.000Z	Yancho	DasEi	i almost installed everything using apt-get .. so nothing is that bad which cannot be reinstalled
2009-11-19T00:18:00.000Z	DasEi	Yancho	I'll leave soon, ask here on how to restore /sbin/init,  anoother possib is reinstalling kernel from cd-repo or a reinstall and afterwards re-mount home
2009-11-19T00:19:00.000Z	DasEi		!clone | Yancho
2009-11-19T00:19:00.000Z	Yancho		ok ill ask as you told me DasEi .. super many thanks for your aid!
2009-11-19T00:19:00.000Z	DasEi		 Yancho: link above can use to get (chrooted) a list of your installed packages on hd, ca
2009-11-19T00:20:00.000Z	Yancho	DasEi	in my case i move my-packages to /home right?
2009-11-19T00:20:00.000Z	DasEi	Yancho	in case you reinstall
2009-11-19T00:21:00.000Z	Yancho		will deb packages be fixed aswell DasEi  ?
2009-11-19T00:21:00.000Z	Yancho		or that clones only aptitude packages?
2009-11-19T00:21:00.000Z	DasEi	Yancho	at a reinstallation ? sure
2009-11-19T00:22:00.000Z	Yancho		ok DasEi  .. so i ask a bit more regarding reinstalling /sbin/initd and then if not i do as u told me
2009-11-19T00:23:00.000Z	DasEi	Yancho	yes, steps to reinstall 1) get current package list 2) reinstall system-hd 3) re-apt packages 4) change fstab to point to farmer home
2009-11-19T00:24:00.000Z	Yancho		thanks DasEi for all your help .. if i just put a 9.10 cd will ur steps be automated?
2009-11-19T00:25:00.000Z	DasEi	Yancho	no, you will then do a fresh install and will then manually get your current choices back only, by using 9.04 can use existing list and upgrade afterwards - your choice
2009-11-19T00:26:00.000Z	Yancho		ok i keep 9.04 then .. ill ask some other guys maybe they can help me restore /sbin/initd if not i do as per ur suggestions :)
2009-11-19T00:27:00.000Z	DasEi	Yancho	good effort, heh, usv's ;-)
