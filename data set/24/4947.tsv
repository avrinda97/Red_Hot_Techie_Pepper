2012-05-03T02:22:00.000Z	maheanuu		I just ran the following commands in the terminal and here are the results, sure could use a guru about now  http://paste.ubuntu.com/963422/
2012-05-03T02:24:00.000Z	maheanuu		Oh, I am running Ubuntu 10.04.4 64bit on a 64 bit Toshiba Laptop A355SD Satellite
2012-05-03T02:26:00.000Z	wylde	maheanuu	what specifically do you want to know about that output?
2012-05-03T02:26:00.000Z	maheanuu		If it tells me why I cannot see the media I inserted into the drive
2012-05-03T02:28:00.000Z	maheanuu		The disk that is loaded is Ubuntu 10.04 LTS Boot and it cannot be read from the boot startup with the CD being set as the 1st boot device
2012-05-03T02:28:00.000Z	wylde	maheanuu	nope, all i can see is that your /dev/cdrom is a symbolic link to sr0, and you have no printer attached/on and your networkcard started. heh
2012-05-03T02:29:00.000Z	maheanuu		I want to know if there is info on why i am not seeing any media that I am trying to read or copy, this started 2 days ago when I burned 2 Ubuntu Disks for give away and the second one didn't burn as there was a message "No Media"
2012-05-03T02:30:00.000Z	wylde	maheanuu	there is nothing related to that in the pastebin you posted.
2012-05-03T02:30:00.000Z	maheanuu		Wylde, do you have any ideas on how I should be trying to troubleshoot this problem?
2012-05-03T02:31:00.000Z	wylde	maheanuu	does your optical drive read other disks correctly?
2012-05-03T02:32:00.000Z	maheanuu		At present it reads nothing I have tried every disk I can think of and after 3 days of sorting through over a hundred disks with the same "No Media" I am of the mind that the drive is bad but I just bought it on friday and it worked fome
2012-05-03T02:33:00.000Z	wylde	maheanuu	DOA hardware happens sometimes. I'd have to agree that it's most likely the hardware.
2012-05-03T02:33:00.000Z	maheanuu		wylde,At present it reads nothing I have tried every disk I can think of and after 3 days of sorting through over a hundred disks with the same "No Media" I am of the mind that the drive is bad but I just bought it on friday and it worked fine
2012-05-03T02:34:00.000Z	wylde	maheanuu	I'd blame a faulty drive too. Things like that happen with electronics sometimes. I've seen my share of DOA hardware :)
2012-05-03T02:35:00.000Z	maheanuu		I live on a little isle, and there is next to nothing here for repair work, the closest place is about 160 miles away and so I was digging so I wouldn't have to take a 12 hour boat ride
2012-05-03T02:35:00.000Z	maheanuu		I should have said as far as parts go, repairs I have been doing myself since the 50's
2012-05-03T02:37:00.000Z	wylde	maheanuu	sorry to hear that, but from what you describe, it definately sounds like faulty hardware. Although there's lots here to get a second opinion from :)
2012-05-03T02:37:00.000Z	maheanuu		IaOra Again, Is there an
2012-05-03T02:38:00.000Z	maheanuu	wylde	I thank you immensely for your help,   I was also trying to see if there might be a way to test the unit to see if it were hdwre or softwre causing the prob
2012-05-03T02:39:00.000Z	wylde	maheanuu	other than re-seating cables and whatnot, not much. Possibly seeing if the device has the same issue connected to another machine?
2012-05-03T02:47:00.000Z	maheanuu	wylde	I just pulled it and will take it to our local shade tree mechanic, I use them only for parts or doing translations when I run into a Windoze problem as all the machines here for the most part are French
2012-05-03T02:48:00.000Z	wylde	maheanuu	alrighty.
2012-05-03T02:49:00.000Z	maheanuu	wylde	it worked perfect until I was doing a burn for give aways,  you were great help, and again I more or less was of the same opinion, just yesterday was a waste and it failed over the weekend and nothing works in the South Pacific when it comes to weekends especially those with a holiday and may day was that
2012-05-03T02:50:00.000Z	wylde	maheanuu	it always seems these sorts of things like to happen at most inconvenient times.
