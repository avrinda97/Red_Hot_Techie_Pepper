2007-08-18T15:15:00.000Z	Creed		Need some help regarding an old HP that keeps losing connectivity to the Internet...all local resources work fine when Internet is lost but everything else is fine. I can ping local resources from it, other PC's can ping like Google...just this one machine cant. Ive installed XP, Ubuntu, RedHat etc so its not software...any help would be nice
2007-08-18T15:17:00.000Z	leagris	Creed	you could investigate dmesg and /var/log/messages for what happend when our HP loos connectivity to the net
2007-08-18T15:18:00.000Z	leagris	Creed	espetially look if interface goes down, if it is getting new DHCP lease...
2007-08-18T15:18:00.000Z	Creed	leagris	its statically assigned an IP so DHCP shouldnt be an issue.
2007-08-18T15:19:00.000Z	leagris	Creed	what type of net linke does it uses? Ethernet, wireless?
2007-08-18T15:20:00.000Z	Creed	leagris	both heh its connected via wired to a Fonera with OpenWRT which a wireless client to a AP
2007-08-18T15:22:00.000Z	Creed	leagris	i tried with another NIC and another Fonera...even a direct wired connection and it still just loses all connectivity outside my subnet.
2007-08-18T15:22:00.000Z	leagris	Creed	when it loos connectivity, can you still join the AP itself?
2007-08-18T15:23:00.000Z	Creed	leagris	yeah its connected and the Fonera itself still has access (ping google.com has a reply, ping google.com from the HP no reply)
2007-08-18T15:25:00.000Z	leagris	Creed	does the link between the HP and the fonera still work when net is lost?
2007-08-18T15:25:00.000Z	Creed	leagris	yeah, I can access the fonera fine, I can access my home network fully, its just everything outside my home network that stops working.
2007-08-18T15:28:00.000Z	leagris	Creed	I know nothing about what's specific to the fonera. Is the fonera AP the default route and DNS relay for the HP or does the HP have direct acces to outside DSN services?
2007-08-18T15:29:00.000Z	Creed	leagris	lets try this without the fonera since I still have the issue with a direct wired ethernet connection to my router. I have replaced everything outside the HP itself and even the NIC and OS to no avail...maybe something in the machine itself that's glitchy?
2007-08-18T15:31:00.000Z	leagris	Creed	though the link between your HP and the router still is ok when you loos net connectivity. I guess there are still questions regarding DNS availability. When it loose net, did you try to ping NET IP instead of relying on host names?
2007-08-18T15:32:00.000Z	Creed	leagris	yeah, the IP's do not resolve either so its not a DNS issue...I have several DNS servers running locally too and they can resolve the addresses for the HP, but the HP cant connect to the addresses.
2007-08-18T15:36:00.000Z	leagris	Creed	If link doesn't go down for the LAN, I guess there is something on the lan preventing your boox from accessing the net and it is unlikely the HP itself. Another host declaring or trying to declare the same IP would interfere as well
2007-08-18T15:36:00.000Z	leagris	Creed	thow hosts with the same IP on the LAN. Some client connecting the lan, obtaining a DHCP lease with th static ip your HP uses
2007-08-18T15:37:00.000Z	Creed	leagris	Ive checked most everything I could think of...There all PC's are statically assigned IP's and nothing else has the same on as it. DHCP is disabled so no host should be able to grab a random IP.
2007-08-18T15:37:00.000Z	Creed	leagris	I just cant figure it out :( I've changed everything in the HP aside from the mobo so Im guessing its that...Ah well, new mobos are like $20 nowdays :)
2007-08-18T15:38:00.000Z	leagris	Creed	does this fonera AP provide DHCP lease for other fonera clients I guess fonera is a free AP providing free NET connectivity to unknown wireless clients
2007-08-18T15:39:00.000Z	leagris	Creed	did you try providing another static IP to the HP?
2007-08-18T15:39:00.000Z	Creed	leagris	I've disabled the AP function on this Fonera since I got a new Fonera+ which I use to share my Internet...And that AP is on a completely different line (its on Qwest ISP, my home network is on Comcast) so it cant be that.
2007-08-18T15:40:00.000Z	Creed	leagris	yup, tried a few different IP's to no avail
2007-08-18T15:41:00.000Z	Creed	leagris	heh its ok :) im just tired of racking my own brain thought Id ask someone else
