2006-04-09T10:59:00.000Z	karim		Hello, my screen resolution is not what i should be, ive tryed to change it but it gets eaven weirder. the panels messup and i get strange artifacts and stuff like that. The only resolution that works is the standard one but it still isnt right. I have a widescreen laptop
2006-04-09T11:00:00.000Z	karim		do you guys see what im writing?
2006-04-09T11:00:00.000Z	gnomefreak	karim	if i answer no would that be a yes?
2006-05-27T06:47:00.000Z	gnomefreak	karim	sudo apt-get install build-essential
2006-05-27T06:47:00.000Z	karim	gnomefreak	I have it already
2006-05-27T06:48:00.000Z	karim	gnomefreak	would you try to build it ?
2006-05-27T06:48:00.000Z	gnomefreak	karim	than your prolly trying to compile it with wrong gcc
2006-05-27T06:48:00.000Z	karim	gnomefreak	the compile works with dpkg-buildpackage
2006-05-27T06:49:00.000Z	gnomefreak	karim	ive never used that way to build anything i normally use the tar
2006-05-27T06:50:00.000Z	karim	gnomefreak	apt-build is like emerge
2006-05-27T06:51:00.000Z	gnomefreak	karim	i know what apt-build is i just only used it once
2006-05-27T06:51:00.000Z	karim	gnomefreak	I use it on powerpc right now, but had the same error on amd64 or i386. don't know what's wrong
2006-05-27T06:58:00.000Z	karim	gnomefreak	the error is  checking for C compiler default output file name... configure: error: C compiler cannot create executables
2006-05-27T06:59:00.000Z	gnomefreak	karim	i would try gcc-3.4
2006-05-27T07:03:00.000Z	karim	gnomefreak	the build goes fine with dpkg-buildpackage on the same source
2006-05-27T07:03:00.000Z	gnomefreak	karim	dpkg has nothing to do with gcc
2006-05-27T07:04:00.000Z	karim	gnomefreak	ok bu dpkg-buildpackage succes where apt-build fails, so I am wondering
2006-05-27T07:17:00.000Z	karim	gnomefreak	checking for C compiler default output file name... configure: error: C compiler cannot create executables  still the same error
2006-05-27T07:18:00.000Z	gnomefreak	karim	i still think its a gcc3.4 issue install gcc-3.4 and thanuse the export command so ubuntu uses 3.4 than try again
2006-05-27T07:20:00.000Z	karim	gnomefreak	I need some help about export command. however some people use it fine with gcc4 on another chanel
2006-05-27T07:21:00.000Z	gnomefreak	karim	exportCC=3.4 i think is the command
2006-05-27T07:23:00.000Z	karim	gnomefreak	runes I am on powerpc, but I will try on a K7 box also
2006-05-27T07:37:00.000Z	karim	gnomefreak	runes, I pasted the config.log here http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14623 . I tried to export gcc3.4 but it fail the same way. there is a lot of unkwnown things in the log. I don't know what it means
2006-05-27T07:39:00.000Z	karim	gnomefreak	ok, the processor is unkown ...
