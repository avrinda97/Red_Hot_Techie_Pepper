2010-10-07T01:23:00.000Z	Steve132		for almost 30 minutes
2010-10-07T01:23:00.000Z	Steve132		well, wall clock, I guess its 20
2010-10-07T01:23:00.000Z	Steve132		the rest of the system is responsive, however
2010-10-07T01:24:00.000Z	Steve132		so I don't want to power off and start over, because its not like a kernel freeze or anything
2010-10-07T01:24:00.000Z	Steve132		but my install process isn't doing anything
2010-10-07T01:24:00.000Z	Steve132		650 gb
2010-10-07T01:24:00.000Z	Steve132		Well, it doesn't have a progress bar or anything
2010-10-07T01:25:00.000Z	Steve132		its still at 0%
2010-10-07T01:25:00.000Z	Steve132		so I'm a little concerned
2010-10-07T01:25:00.000Z	Steve132		how do I start it over? There doesn't seem to be any "restart" thing
2010-10-07T01:26:00.000Z	bobstro	Steve132	 how big is the partition being resized?
2010-10-07T01:26:00.000Z	bobstro	Steve132	 if it has to re-size, then move a lot of data, it can take quite a while.
2010-10-07T01:26:00.000Z	bobstro	Steve132	 are you seeing disk activity?
2010-10-07T01:27:00.000Z	bobstro	Steve132	 i did something recently on my notebook with a fraction of your space, and just left it overnight.
2010-10-07T01:27:00.000Z	bobstro	Steve132	 is there a disk light flashing?
2010-10-07T01:27:00.000Z	bobstro	Steve132	 or can you hear it working the drive? if so, let it be.
2010-10-07T01:38:00.000Z	bobstro	Steve132	 i had it bomb out on me once and had to use the 'repair' option on a vista machine. it recovered just fine though.
2010-10-07T01:39:00.000Z	bobstro	Steve132	 i don't think there are any guarantees though. if it has died, you can try rebooting and see if it's ok.
2010-10-07T01:39:00.000Z	bobstro	Steve132	 i've noticed windows will insist on doing a chkdsk if the partition is modified.
2010-10-07T01:39:00.000Z	bobstro	Steve132	 you followed the advice about backups, right?
2010-10-07T01:40:00.000Z	bobstro	Steve132	 if you boot the windows installation media, there's a repair option.
2010-10-07T01:40:00.000Z	Steve132	bobstro	A) yes, mostly, but its not easy when I'm in a hurry and have 150 gb of stuff
2010-10-07T01:40:00.000Z	bobstro	Steve132	 you can get back here with a live cd if needed.
2010-10-07T01:40:00.000Z	bobstro	Steve132	 i've not lost anything, but had a few scary moments on two occasions.
