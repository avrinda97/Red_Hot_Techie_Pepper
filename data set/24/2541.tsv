2012-08-29T03:19:00.000Z	py		if i turn on ufw will i get disconected from ssh ?
2012-08-29T03:19:00.000Z	bkc_	py	if you block port22 (don't open it) then yes
2012-08-29T03:20:00.000Z	py	bkc_	is it possible to check rules
2012-08-29T03:22:00.000Z	bkc_	py	afaik there's no rules before adding them, hence all are blocked... I'd setup the rules before enabling the firewall :)
2012-08-29T03:22:00.000Z	py	bkc_	what does this do: udo ufw default allow udo ufw default deny
2012-08-29T03:23:00.000Z	bkc_	py	that blocks everything :)
2012-08-29T03:23:00.000Z	py	bkc_	aha ok
2012-08-29T03:23:00.000Z	bkc_	py	ooh... that's 2 commands actually :/
2012-08-29T03:24:00.000Z	bkc_	py	sudo ufw default allow <-- all open and swell, sudo ufw default deny <-- all closed behind walls :)
2012-08-29T03:24:00.000Z	bkc_	py	and after that you have no ssh ^^
2012-08-29T03:25:00.000Z	bkc_	py	ufw allow ssh, ufw default deny <-- that will work, in that order (!!)
2012-08-29T03:26:00.000Z	bkc_	py	not block all... just the ones without a rule... hence 'default
2012-08-29T03:28:00.000Z	py	bkc_	dr_willis oki doki i would like to filter ssh so there won't be some jurks who try to brutforce ssh or something... so it will be filter only for my ip
2012-08-29T03:29:00.000Z	py	bkc_	dr_willis than i run ircd server wowza streaming and some other stuff that is open for public those ports should stay open for everyone
2012-08-29T03:29:00.000Z	py	bkc_	dr_willis so what i am trying to do is filter ssh :)
2012-08-29T03:29:00.000Z	bkc_	py	that requires more than ufw ^^
2012-08-29T03:30:00.000Z	py	bkc_	why :)
2012-08-29T03:31:00.000Z	bkc_	py	I don't think you quite understan dhow ports and firewalls work, and I'm to drunk to explain ^^
2012-08-29T03:33:00.000Z	bkc_	py	and then I just have to rootkit your computer, and I'm done :)
2012-08-29T03:33:00.000Z	bkc_	py	filtered ip is really a moot argument :)
2012-08-29T03:34:00.000Z	bkc_	py	also, afaik you can turn on auto-blacklisting. so it will blacklist bruteforcers :/
2012-08-29T03:35:00.000Z	py	bkc_	graingert wait
2012-08-29T03:36:00.000Z	bkc_	py	also, a strong password ^^
2012-08-29T03:37:00.000Z	bkc_	py	not really
