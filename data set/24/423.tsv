2012-04-30T13:56:00.000Z	z3bra		Haha, then I was not wrong \o/
2012-04-30T13:57:00.000Z	z3bra		Then, unity is the only DE on pangolin ?
2012-04-30T13:58:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	z3bra	there is also lxde, xfce, kde, gnome-shell, awesome, ratpoison, etc
2012-04-30T13:58:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	z3bra	if you want a different one as "default", try xubuntu, kubuntu or lubuntu
2012-04-30T13:59:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	z3bra	you can't set it as the default IN unity or gnome-shell as ratpoison *replaces* unity or gnome-shell
2012-04-30T13:59:00.000Z	z3bra	DarwinSurvivor	don't worry, if I want another one, I will manage changing it ^^
2012-04-30T14:00:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	z3bra	you *might* be able to run it with gnome3, but I have no idea if that would even work...
2012-04-30T14:00:00.000Z	z3bra	DarwinSurvivor	Ratpoison is a Window manager
2012-04-30T14:00:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	z3bra	i know, i've used it (and its derivative stumpwm)
2012-04-30T14:01:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	z3bra	actually, I'm not sure if ratpoison IS in pangolin, since it's been discontinued and replaced by stumpwm
2012-04-30T14:02:00.000Z	z3bra	DarwinSurvivor	Arf, because on Archlinux forum, or elsewhere, I rode someone that had RP as his WM insinde unity
2012-04-30T14:03:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	z3bra	well, you may be able to use stumpwm with parts of unity (launcher, panel, etc).
2012-04-30T14:03:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	z3bra	the best way to find out is to try it!
2012-04-30T14:03:00.000Z	z3bra	DarwinSurvivor	precise upgrading actually ;)
2012-04-30T14:04:00.000Z	z3bra	DarwinSurvivor	But as i'm on my pro laptop, I prefer being sure of what I do :P
2012-04-30T14:04:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	z3bra	install ubuntu in virtualbox, then you can save the state and try a whole BUNCH of configs and just roll back each time without worrying about it
2012-04-30T14:05:00.000Z	z3bra	DarwinSurvivor	I'll if I find the time ;)
2012-05-22T12:04:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	z3bra	the mode emulates the old vi. Is there a technical reason for your request, or is it purely nostalgic?
2012-05-22T12:05:00.000Z	z3bra	DarwinSurvivor	Got non technical reason btw ^^
2012-05-22T12:08:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	z3bra	I don't think the original vi has been supported (by its developers) for over 10 years, vim pretty much replaced it.
2012-05-22T12:09:00.000Z	z3bra	DarwinSurvivor	But Vi, *might* isn't a *nix default program ?
2012-05-22T12:11:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	z3bra	if you haven't run an apt-get clean recently, there should be a copy of the file in /var/cache/apt/. look for a .deb file with "gnome-shell" in the name. open that file (it's just an archive) and it should have the original file in it :)
