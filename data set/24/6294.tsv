2005-11-19T11:01:00.000Z	pjott		Hi all! =)
2005-11-19T11:02:00.000Z	pjott		I need some help here, with a Ubuntu Linux I downloaded from Ubuntu's WEB Page.
2005-11-19T11:02:00.000Z	NoUse	pjott	ask a question
2005-11-19T11:02:00.000Z	pjott	NoUse	sure ;)
2005-11-19T11:03:00.000Z	NoUse	pjott	what program are you trying to install?
2005-11-19T11:04:00.000Z	pjott	NoUse	LimeWire
2005-11-19T11:05:00.000Z	NoUse	pjott	it's probably easier to just use the generic installer ubotu sent you
2005-11-19T11:21:00.000Z	NoUse	pjott	did the installer not work?
2005-11-19T11:21:00.000Z	pjott	NoUse	no. Because I have Ubuntu, and it does not support "*.rmp" files :/
2005-11-19T11:22:00.000Z	NoUse	pjott	did you follow the link that ubotu sent you before?
2005-11-19T11:22:00.000Z	NoUse	pjott	that gives you a non-RPM installer
2005-11-19T11:24:00.000Z	NoUse	pjott	follow the instructions ubotu sent you
2005-11-19T11:27:00.000Z	pjott	NoUse	why did you get me a windows installer? :S
2005-11-19T11:28:00.000Z	pjott	NoUse	why did you get me a windows installer? :S
2005-11-19T11:28:00.000Z	NoUse	pjott	it's a java app, its universal
2005-11-19T11:28:00.000Z	pjott	NoUse	ah ;P
2005-11-19T11:28:00.000Z	NoUse	pjott	follow the instructions ubotu sent you
2005-11-19T11:29:00.000Z	pjott	NoUse	damnit! I closed it again :s Please send it to me for the last time :) *Tears-my-hair*!!!
2005-11-19T12:20:00.000Z	NoUse	pjott	have you read the java wiki page?
2005-11-19T12:32:00.000Z	NoUse	pjott	you have to make sure the java executable is in your path
2005-11-19T12:33:00.000Z	pjott	NoUse	"chmod +x /home/pjott/Desktop/java.bin" -- DONE! -- Terminal: /home/pjott/Desktop/java.bin -- "Run in Terminal" -- DONE -- Installing... -- DONE. But when I'm aboutto open runLime.sh in the LimeWire folder, it says: OOPS, unable to locate java exec in  /usr/lib/  hierarchy
2005-11-19T12:34:00.000Z	NoUse	pjott	you have to alter your PATH and make sure the java exectable is in there
2005-11-19T12:34:00.000Z	pjott	NoUse	ok ;)
2005-11-19T12:34:00.000Z	NoUse	pjott	google around and you should find something on it
