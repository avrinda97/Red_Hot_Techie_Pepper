2007-09-23T15:33:00.000Z	Naisenu		Hey. My 250GB NTFS storage drive is missing in Ubuntu. It should be /media/hdb1/ It was there yesterday. It is not there today. Rebooted in between to the Windows side and came back. But did not do anything to that drive.
2007-09-23T15:34:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Naisenu	Did windows happen to crash or be shut down improperly?
2007-09-23T15:35:00.000Z	Naisenu	Jordan_U	No, but Ubuntu refused to restart. It crashed the X Session.
2007-09-23T15:35:00.000Z	Naisenu	Jordan_U	So I used the old reboot button on the front of the PC itself.
2007-09-23T15:36:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Naisenu	Then the NTFS drive might have been labeled unclean since it was not unmounted properly, booting into windows should fix it if that is the problem IIRC
2007-09-23T15:36:00.000Z	Naisenu	Jordan_U	I have booted into Windows and then back into Ubuntu. And even rebooted Ubuntu.
2007-09-23T15:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Naisenu	Ok, is it listed in your fstab?
2007-09-23T15:38:00.000Z	Naisenu	Jordan_U	Is that just open a terminal and type "fstab"?
2007-09-23T15:38:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Naisenu	If so what happens when you run "sudo mount -a" ( pastebin the output if any )
2007-09-23T15:38:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Naisenu	No, it's a file, /etc/fstab
2007-09-23T15:39:00.000Z	Naisenu	Jordan_U	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/38395/
2007-10-25T08:39:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Naisenu	Yes
2007-10-25T08:42:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Naisenu	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/NvidiaManual
2007-10-25T08:49:00.000Z	Naisenu	Jordan_U	Failing on that with the following error: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/42035/
2007-10-25T08:50:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Naisenu	Why are you running the -i386 kernel?
2007-10-25T08:51:00.000Z	Naisenu	Jordan_U	Don't remember the rationale at the time. (Quoting the husband who knows more) Is this a problem?
2007-10-25T08:53:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Naisenu	You should use the -generic kernel
2007-10-25T08:54:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Naisenu	I seriously doubt that your computer is old enough to require -i386
2007-10-25T08:54:00.000Z	Naisenu	Jordan_U	So how do I install and use the generic kernel?
2007-10-25T08:54:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Naisenu	sudo apt-get install linux-generic
2007-10-25T08:55:00.000Z	Naisenu	Jordan_U	And for the record it's an Athlon (I forget the CPU speed)
2007-10-25T08:55:00.000Z	Naisenu	Jordan_U	Apparently it's already installed. How do I use it instead of the -i386?
2007-10-25T08:56:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Naisenu	Just boot from it at the grub menu, if you don't see a menu press escape at boot
2007-10-25T08:57:00.000Z	Naisenu	Jordan_U	Thank you. Will attempt and see what happens.
