2008-06-19T02:19:00.000Z	pbryan	lbci	"﻿﻿javaldx: Could not find a Java Runtime Environment!"; looks like it won't recognize my JRE environment anymore.
2008-06-19T02:19:00.000Z	lbci	pbryan	are you running sun's or gnu java ?
2008-06-19T02:20:00.000Z	pbryan	lbci	Sun's. Looks like it might be related to AMD64...
2008-06-19T02:21:00.000Z	lbci	pbryan	lets not jump the gun:) is it java 5 or the newer 6?
2008-06-19T02:21:00.000Z	pbryan	lbci	Looks like https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openoffice.org/+bug/237382 (bottom comment) is related...
2008-06-19T02:21:00.000Z	pbryan	lbci	openjdk-6-jdk and openjdk-6-jre
2008-06-19T02:22:00.000Z	lbci	pbryan	well your right that could be a winner... have you tried removing the conf folder from your home dir yet?
2008-06-19T02:23:00.000Z	pbryan	lbci	I'm trying a few combinations right now... ;)
2008-06-19T02:23:00.000Z	lbci	pbryan	also apt-get -f install, apt-get autoremove, for any lingering dependencies?
2008-06-19T02:24:00.000Z	pbryan	lbci	no love on removing the .openoffice2 dir or removing -gtk & -gnome packages.
2008-06-19T02:24:00.000Z	pbryan	lbci	I wonder if I should try the OpenOffice 3 beta... :)
2008-06-19T02:25:00.000Z	lbci	pbryan	see last msg bout deps?
2008-06-19T02:25:00.000Z	pbryan	lbci	Yes, no lingering deps around.
2008-06-19T02:25:00.000Z	pbryan	lbci	deborphan reports nothing interesting either.
2008-06-19T02:27:00.000Z	lbci	pbryan	hrmm did you say yer on 64bit amd?
2008-06-19T02:27:00.000Z	pbryan	lbci	Yup, amd64 build.

2008-06-19T02:28:00.000Z	pbryan	lbci	I see a few more bug reports in Launchpad for this (though no workaround as yet).
2008-06-19T02:28:00.000Z	pbryan	lbci	/me walks away from my desk for about 15 mins. Feel free to PM me.
