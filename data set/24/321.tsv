2011-11-27T16:05:00.000Z	sharpK		from windows
2011-11-27T16:06:00.000Z	sharpK		hmmm, just disbled the eset firewall for 10 minutes, but same error
2011-11-27T16:06:00.000Z	sharpK		well, I am on 7, so you may be right
2011-11-27T16:07:00.000Z	sharpK		but SSH would be 3rd party on all the rest of the windows comps, correct?
2011-11-27T16:08:00.000Z	sharpK		my computer that is
2011-11-27T16:08:00.000Z	sharpK		and I should have mentioned, I seem to be able to access the windows files from ubunutu
2011-11-27T16:08:00.000Z	sharpK		I even transferred af ile over to the desktop
2011-11-27T16:09:00.000Z	sharpK		Actionparsnip: nope, it says WORKGROUP \\Server\share
2011-11-27T16:10:00.000Z	sharpK		heh, could be it, I can access other windows computers on my network thouhg
2011-11-27T16:10:00.000Z	sharpK		just the ubuntu that's giving me trouble
2011-11-27T16:11:00.000Z	happygol1cky	sharpK	another point is if you're using a wireless adapter for windows you want to enable the wireless zero configuration
2011-11-27T16:12:00.000Z	sharpK	happygol1cky	nope, all through ethernet into a WRT54g
2011-11-27T16:13:00.000Z	happygol1cky	sharpK	did you allow 192.168.1.*
2011-11-27T16:13:00.000Z	sharpK	happygol1cky	ubuntu or windows?
2011-11-27T16:16:00.000Z	sharpK	happygol1cky	I search for 192.168 in the smc.conf file, it doesn't find anything, so what line to I add
2011-11-27T16:19:00.000Z	happygol1cky	sharpK	i think i might have been thinking print server, nevermind that, but in that file you should set path, browsable to yes, read only to no, quest ok = no, create mask = 0644, directory mask = 0755, force user = YourUsername, force group = YourGroupName
2011-11-27T16:20:00.000Z	sharpK	happygol1cky	restarting the ubuntu now, will try it when as soon as it comes up
2011-11-27T16:25:00.000Z	happygol1cky	sharpK	http://paste.ubuntu.com/751303/ that's what mine looks like, the share is at the bottom
2011-11-27T16:28:00.000Z	happygol1cky	sharpK	you could also access it from ssh, I use cygwin and putty for complete access
2011-11-27T16:37:00.000Z	happygol1cky	sharpK	you're positive wireless zero cinfiguration is an enabled service and running?
2011-11-27T16:55:00.000Z	sharpK	happygol1cky	finally got access to that folder, seems to work after messing with a few lines in the smcconf
2011-11-27T16:56:00.000Z	happygol1cky	sharpK	sounds good, give putty and cygwin a wack, it's neat having complete terminal in windows with ability to run all the apps including the graphical ones
2011-11-27T16:57:00.000Z	sharpK	happygol1cky	i'll definitely look into that for my windows comp, but I can't imagine my dad sshing to stream some media :)
2011-11-27T16:57:00.000Z	happygol1cky	sharpK	i mount my windows drive to my linux machine from windows in putty, it's surreal
