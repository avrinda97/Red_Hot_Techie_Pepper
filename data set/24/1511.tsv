2010-10-21T07:49:00.000Z	al_nz1		well why does "find / password.lst" fail when I can see the file????
2010-10-21T07:49:00.000Z	Blue1	al_nz1	try /etc/password
2011-01-18T12:30:00.000Z	Blue1	al_nz1	can you get to a terminal?  ctrl+alt+f1
2011-01-18T12:30:00.000Z	al_nz1	Blue1	yes
2011-01-18T12:31:00.000Z	Blue1	al_nz1	do you know how to restart the gdm?
2011-01-18T12:32:00.000Z	Blue1	al_nz1	login and then do the following
2011-01-18T12:32:00.000Z	Blue1	al_nz1	sudo service gdm restart
2011-01-18T12:33:00.000Z	al_nz1	Blue1	ok done and it takes me back to the gui login window
2011-01-18T12:33:00.000Z	Blue1	al_nz1	fine just login again.
2011-01-18T12:34:00.000Z	Blue1	al_nz1	ahh we'll have to do a bit more detective work -- what was the last thing you did before this problem occured?
2011-01-18T12:34:00.000Z	al_nz1	Blue1	tyring to get mythtv to install :-(
2011-01-18T12:35:00.000Z	Blue1	al_nz1	oh i can't help you there
2011-01-18T12:35:00.000Z	al_nz1	Blue1	what about del the file, is it , x11org.conf?
2011-01-18T12:36:00.000Z	Blue1	al_nz1	i wouldn't delete it, i'd rename it -- something like:  sudo mv x11org.conf x11org.conf.bkup
2011-01-18T12:37:00.000Z	Blue1	al_nz1	that should work
2011-01-18T12:37:00.000Z	al_nz1	Blue1	where is x11org kept?
2011-01-18T12:37:00.000Z	Blue1	al_nz1	this way you can see what's in the file, rather then just nuking it.
2011-01-18T12:39:00.000Z	al_nz1	Blue1	any idea where that file is?
2011-01-18T12:40:00.000Z	Blue1	al_nz1	curse this new keyboard - its /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2011-01-18T12:46:00.000Z	al_nz1	Blue1	tail var/log/messages?
2011-01-18T12:46:00.000Z	Blue1	al_nz1	i have never seen mythtv so sorry I can't help
2011-01-18T12:47:00.000Z	al_nz1	Blue1	I am not sure thats what killed it
2011-01-18T12:47:00.000Z	Blue1	al_nz1	that would be a could place to start, or you can simply do dmesg
2011-07-18T10:45:00.000Z	Blue1	al_nz1	not sure but isn't 443 used by samba?
