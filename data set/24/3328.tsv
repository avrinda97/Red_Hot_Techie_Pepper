2008-02-27T04:49:00.000Z	bod_	Squawk	why do you want a root password anyway?
2008-02-27T04:50:00.000Z	Squawk	bod_	you want to run a system with no root password?
2008-02-27T04:50:00.000Z	bod_	Squawk	root on all machines on a clean install has 'no' password
2008-02-27T04:51:00.000Z	Squawk	bod_	coming from a gentoo background, the only user created at the start is root, and you create a root password. Other users are then added
2008-02-27T04:52:00.000Z	bod_	Squawk	root is a user yes, sudo is used to acces the privileges of root, bein root is extremely dangerous, and it means you have to apply a password to 'root' therefore making it hackable,. if root has no password, noone can lo in as root and destroy your system
2008-02-27T04:53:00.000Z	Squawk	bod_	if you have a normal user with sudo privs if someone gets access to a normal user account (easier than the root account), and that user has sudo access to the root account, then you already craeted an easy way in
2008-02-27T04:53:00.000Z	bod_	Squawk	only if they no the password
2008-02-27T04:57:00.000Z	bod_	Squawk	no, the user has a password that can temporarily *borrow* the privileges of root,.,. not access root account
2008-02-27T04:57:00.000Z	Squawk	bod_	try running sudo su - and see if you get full root privs (you do)
2008-02-27T04:58:00.000Z	bod_	Squawk	im aware,. but that doesnt mean i have become the root user
2008-02-27T04:58:00.000Z	Squawk	bod_	yes it does
2008-02-27T04:59:00.000Z	Squawk	bod_	you run "sudo su -" and you ARE root
2008-02-27T04:59:00.000Z	bod_	Squawk	it does not chane me to being the root user, it gives me rot privileges and changes the name in the terminal, if im root in terminal and then try and access synaptic from the gui, it will still ask for a password (afaik) therefore not being the root user
2008-02-27T04:59:00.000Z	Squawk	bod_	try it
2008-02-27T05:00:00.000Z	Squawk	bod_	if that was the case, you could never get root access (and believe me, you can)
2008-02-27T05:00:00.000Z	bod_	Squawk	just tried and it asked for a password,,.,. your only root in the terminal
2008-02-27T05:01:00.000Z	Squawk	bod_	of course, where else would you be root?
2008-02-27T05:01:00.000Z	Squawk	bod_	nobodoy is stupid enough to actualy login to hte box as root
2008-02-27T05:01:00.000Z	bod_	Squawk	lol,.,. ive seen people ask about it in here,.,.;~)
2008-02-27T05:02:00.000Z	bod_	Squawk	what do you mean? like /home/.bod    ??
2008-02-27T05:03:00.000Z	Squawk	bod_	you put . in your path and if you happen to type the name of an executable file thats in the current directory, bobs your unble, its executed
2008-02-27T05:03:00.000Z	Squawk	bod_	don't
2008-02-27T05:03:00.000Z	bod_	Squawk	ok,. cool,.,.thanks for the info,.,.;~)
2008-02-28T04:27:00.000Z	Squawk	bod_	hows he doing that? router config that you dont have hte pass for?
