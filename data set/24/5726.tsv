2011-08-17T14:47:00.000Z	mrgenixus		but it can't, It's (obviously) in-use
2011-08-17T14:48:00.000Z	mrgenixus		but it doesn't really need to be doing this. I just needs to mount the (already formatted) partition
2011-08-17T14:48:00.000Z	mrgenixus		I can't select it as the root partition, unless I tell it to format
2011-08-17T14:48:00.000Z	mrgenixus		^^ that's the bug
2011-08-17T14:49:00.000Z	mrgenixus		I'm hoping that, as a stop-gap, the alternate cd will work
2011-08-17T14:49:00.000Z	mrgenixus		the installer wants to repartition, in order to format
2011-08-17T14:50:00.000Z	mrgenixus		it's XFS
2011-08-17T14:51:00.000Z	mrgenixus		so, it can' be unmounted, as it's the running session
2011-08-17T14:51:00.000Z	mrgenixus		ergo, I can't reformat
2011-08-17T14:51:00.000Z	mrgenixus		ergo, I can't select a root partition
2011-08-17T14:51:00.000Z	ikonia	mrgenixus	thats not really a bug
2011-08-17T14:51:00.000Z	mrgenixus	ikonia	in what way is that not a bug
2011-08-17T14:52:00.000Z	mrgenixus		my cdrom is ruined, won't boot
2011-08-17T14:52:00.000Z	mrgenixus		the system is a laptop, and predates booting from usb, apparently
2011-08-17T14:52:00.000Z	ikonia	mrgenixus	in that how can you expec tto format a partition you are using
2011-08-17T14:52:00.000Z	mrgenixus		I'm not trying to format the partition I'm using
2011-08-17T14:52:00.000Z	mrgenixus		I'm trying to select an entirely different partion
2011-08-17T14:52:00.000Z	ikonia	mrgenixus	so why can't you unmount it
2011-08-17T14:53:00.000Z	ikonia	mrgenixus	if you're not using that partition why can't you unmount it
2011-08-17T14:53:00.000Z	mrgenixus		I don't need to unmount it, it's not mounted
2011-08-17T14:53:00.000Z	ikonia	mrgenixus	why can't you select a root file system then ?
2011-08-17T14:53:00.000Z	mrgenixus		the installer insists it needs to unmount the partion I'm using, not the one I'm installing to
2011-08-17T14:53:00.000Z	mrgenixus	ikonia	because there's a bug in the installer
2011-08-17T14:53:00.000Z	ikonia	mrgenixus	that doesn't sound correct
