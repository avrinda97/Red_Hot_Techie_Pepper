2007-11-23T21:39:00.000Z	DaSkreech	genii	Can you help Naelr ?
2007-11-23T21:40:00.000Z	genii	DaSkreech	I'll scroll up and examine
2007-11-23T21:40:00.000Z	DaSkreech	genii	His laptop can boot from live cd and install but the install cannot boot
2007-11-23T21:41:00.000Z	genii	DaSkreech	Ah, i think i recall this issue from last night. I don't have any immediate ideas on it
2007-11-23T21:42:00.000Z	DaSkreech	genii	It seems to be the hard drive controller
2007-11-23T21:44:00.000Z	DaSkreech	genii	In busybox?
2007-11-23T22:01:00.000Z	DaSkreech	genii	Ok now we are going to try and make sure the hard drive has the modules from the CD I think
2007-11-23T23:17:00.000Z	DaSkreech	genii	how much progress?
2007-11-23T23:23:00.000Z	DaSkreech	genii	how's the progress
2007-11-23T23:27:00.000Z	genii	DaSkreech	Yes, i empathise
2007-11-23T23:27:00.000Z	DaSkreech	genii	can I add a ISO to software sources ?
2007-11-23T23:28:00.000Z	genii	DaSkreech	Ya, use apt-cdrom. alternate cd can be used this way but not livecd. depends on contents
2007-11-23T23:31:00.000Z	DaSkreech	genii	apt-cdrom seems to just unmount the dir
2007-11-23T23:32:00.000Z	genii	DaSkreech	usually apt-cdrom will prompt you for cds to put in and register into sources.list. then it looks there for repos etc etc
2007-11-23T23:33:00.000Z	DaSkreech	genii	How do i "put in" a ISO ?
2007-11-23T23:36:00.000Z	genii	DaSkreech	Good question :) I think I'd loopmount it. If you have no /dev/cdrom1 then you can do something like mkdir /tmp/iso;mount -o loop /pathtoisofile/isofile.iso /tmp/iso ; ln -s /tmp/iso /dev/cdrom1         then when it asks to insert a cd make sure the cd is mounted
2007-11-23T23:36:00.000Z	DaSkreech	genii	Wow Duh! :) thanks
2007-11-23T23:38:00.000Z	genii	DaSkreech	I guess they are chronologically challenged
2007-11-23T23:52:00.000Z	DaSkreech	genii	No Love. Would it have to be a mknod command ?
2007-11-23T23:53:00.000Z	genii	DaSkreech	No. There must be some way

2007-11-24T00:50:00.000Z	DaSkreech	genii	Buwahahahaah Success is mine!
2008-10-30T07:17:00.000Z	genii	DaSkreech	I'm not sure how I feel about fruit in my coffee. But thanks
