2009-03-04T14:22:00.000Z	sophia		Anyone knows a good performance testing tool for mediaplayers?
2009-03-04T14:23:00.000Z	Sepero	sophia	May I inquire why?
2009-03-04T14:25:00.000Z	sophia	Sepero	Its my project, i have to check performance of video rendering process w.r.t graphics library
2009-03-04T14:26:00.000Z	sophia	Sepero	I have to check which library gives better performance
2009-03-04T14:28:00.000Z	Sepero	sophia	Ah, sounds complicated. Personally, I would use only Mplayer, and set it to run at full speed over the multiple libraries with the audio off.
2009-03-04T14:28:00.000Z	Sepero	sophia	And time the results.
2009-03-04T14:28:00.000Z	Sepero	sophia	Making sure dropping frames was turned off.
2009-03-04T14:29:00.000Z	sophia	Sepero	I wanted to go through gnome-mplayer
2009-03-04T14:30:00.000Z	sophia	Sepero	And problem is there is no benchmark option in gnome-mplayer
2009-03-04T14:30:00.000Z	Sepero	sophia	ok. I'm very doubtful any benchmarking software exists for that purpose.
2009-03-04T14:32:00.000Z	Sepero	sophia	What you're asking is very weird, because a library may be able to run fast, but what good is that if the media is very lightly compressed? There appears to be too many factors.
2009-03-04T14:32:00.000Z	sophia	Sepero	can you please tell me why we turn off dropping frames?
2009-03-04T14:33:00.000Z	Sepero	sophia	Because dropping frames causes certain parts of the video to be completely skipped.
2009-03-04T14:34:00.000Z	sophia	Sepero	ok
2009-03-04T14:34:00.000Z	Sepero	sophia	For example, I have the same media in two formats. Same video, but first format is 10MB, second format is 100MB. Which would you guess is going to run faster?
2009-03-04T14:35:00.000Z	Sepero	sophia	Even if they are both 10MB, one could be lower quality than the other, making a huge difference.
2009-03-04T14:37:00.000Z	Sepero	sophia	I'm not saying it isn't a noble thing to try and benchmark though. I just think that you may be in over your head with this project.
2009-03-04T14:39:00.000Z	sophia	Sepero	ok i am bit confused regarding my project.. but any how i have to report performance of different libraries.
2009-03-04T14:40:00.000Z	Sepero	sophia	No offense, but I would select another project. I do not think you are going to get results of any value from gnome-mplayer.
2009-03-04T14:41:00.000Z	Sepero	sophia	Acknowledging that you don't know what frame-dropping is, I personally think your experience in this area is much too low.
2009-03-04T14:44:00.000Z	sophia	Sepero	 yes i am new to this area since i am a student i need to learn a lot
2009-03-04T14:45:00.000Z	sophia	Sepero	 Anyways thanks for your suggestions..
2009-03-04T14:46:00.000Z	Sepero	sophia	Yeah, I'm sorry I couldn't give you better news. :\
2009-03-04T14:47:00.000Z	sophia	Sepero	 :-)
