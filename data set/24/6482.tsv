2007-04-26T06:30:00.000Z	eck	bryan	not by default
2007-04-26T08:56:00.000Z	eck	bryan	it would be parted
2007-04-26T08:57:00.000Z	bryan	eck	? parted?
2007-04-26T08:57:00.000Z	eck	bryan	gpart = guess partitions
2007-04-26T08:57:00.000Z	eck	bryan	no, that uses parted (which is totally different from gpart)
2007-04-26T09:00:00.000Z	bryan	eck	are you talking about the Gnome partiton editor?
2007-04-26T09:00:00.000Z	eck	bryan	no, there is a separate program called gpart. the gnome partition editor is gparted
2007-04-26T09:00:00.000Z	bryan	eck	should i find it in synaptic?
2007-04-26T09:00:00.000Z	eck	bryan	yes
2007-04-26T09:04:00.000Z	bryan	eck	i cannot find gpart after install?
2007-04-26T09:05:00.000Z	eck	bryan	i think it is a command line sort of thing (I've never used it myself though)
2007-04-28T05:34:00.000Z	eck	bryan	it's probably good if you use ppc...
2007-04-28T05:34:00.000Z	eck	bryan	yellowdog is for ppc architecture
2007-04-28T05:37:00.000Z	bryan	eck	i cannot find ANY support for the Sony PSP
2007-04-28T05:42:00.000Z	bryan	eck	how do you feel about Gentoo Linux?
2007-04-28T05:42:00.000Z	eck	bryan	i used to use it, i don't like it as much as ubuntu
2007-04-29T06:48:00.000Z	eck	bryan	also jabber
2007-04-29T06:49:00.000Z	bryan	eck	thank you!!! i just couldn't remember the name "jabber" for some reason
2007-04-29T06:52:00.000Z	bryan	eck	is the jabber server package i should install called "jabberd2"?
2007-04-29T06:52:00.000Z	eck	bryan	yes, i believe so
