2010-05-21T03:36:00.000Z	Sonsee		what went wrong?
2010-05-21T03:36:00.000Z	Sonsee		what driver?
2010-05-21T03:38:00.000Z	Sonsee		<hookworm24> try previeus kernel if you have and it will work, I hope )) somehow, on my dell the 10.04 does not work with the latest kernel either.
2010-05-21T03:39:00.000Z	hookworm24	Sonsee	I wanted to try that but i'm not sure what to press/ what commands to use...i'm a bit of a linux noob.
2010-05-21T03:45:00.000Z	hookworm24	Sonsee	It appears my error on startup is "ERROR: Frimware file "b43legacy/ucode4.fw" not found or load failed"  any idea what this means? seems to be a driver of sorts...?
2010-05-21T03:50:00.000Z	hookworm24	Sonsee	I was running xubuntu 9.04 and i used the update manager to upgrade to 10.04. the upgrade seemed to go on without any problems. i restarted after the upgrade and now it hangs on startup just as the xubuntu screen appears. that error message appears just before.
2010-05-21T03:50:00.000Z	Sonsee	hookworm24	then you MUST have the previeus kernel. Try to load that.
2010-05-21T03:51:00.000Z	hookworm24	Sonsee	sorry, it was 9.10 that I upgraded from.
2010-05-21T03:51:00.000Z	Sonsee	hookworm24	this one too.
2010-05-21T03:51:00.000Z	Sonsee	hookworm24	I had that problem
2010-05-21T03:52:00.000Z	hookworm24	Sonsee	not sure how to access previous kernels, i am at the recovery menu, can i do it from shell prompt?
2010-05-21T03:52:00.000Z	Sonsee	hookworm24	I don`t know why the ubuntu`s kernel does not load on dell ))
2010-05-21T03:52:00.000Z	hookworm24	Sonsee	i think i will be reinstalling karmic until this is sorted
2010-05-21T03:52:00.000Z	Sonsee	hookworm24	can you access the grub loader?
2010-05-21T03:54:00.000Z	hookworm24	Sonsee	I will try. for some reason it does not pop automatically like it does on this ubuntu machine. not sure why
2010-05-21T03:55:00.000Z	hookworm24	Sonsee	ok. loading previous kernel
2010-05-21T03:56:00.000Z	hookworm24	Sonsee	looks good so far
2010-05-21T03:56:00.000Z	Sonsee	hookworm24	try sudo update-grub in case you`ve deleted the lines from grub.cfg
2010-05-21T03:56:00.000Z	hookworm24	Sonsee	nah, it's all there, i just did not know how to access it
2010-05-21T03:56:00.000Z	hookworm24	Sonsee	old kernel is working fine now. hmm..
2010-05-21T03:57:00.000Z	Sonsee	hookworm24	go to /boot/grub/grub.cfg file and delete the lines of the latest kernel so it will boot automatically
2010-05-21T03:58:00.000Z	Sonsee	hookworm24	then google that problem, I didn`t
2010-05-21T03:58:00.000Z	Sonsee	hookworm24	if you find some answers, tell me
2010-05-21T03:58:00.000Z	hookworm24	Sonsee	alright...i'll see what i can find. thanks for the help
