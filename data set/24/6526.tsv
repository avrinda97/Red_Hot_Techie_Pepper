2006-02-19T09:24:00.000Z	jordan		hey guys, I cant seem to get gmail to work with ubuntu, wondering if anything is wrong, all other sites seem to work, including www.google.com, are the gmail servers down?
2006-02-19T09:24:00.000Z	_jason	jordan	what ahppens when you go to the site?
2006-02-19T10:00:00.000Z	_jason	jordan	close all isntances of firefox, run firefox in a terminal with 'firefox -safe-mode' and see if gmail works
2006-02-19T10:02:00.000Z	_jason	jordan	really, what version?
2006-02-19T10:04:00.000Z	_jason	jordan	I'm pretty sure it
2006-02-19T10:04:00.000Z	jordan	_jason	it booted into safe mode, I'm logging in right now
2006-02-19T10:04:00.000Z	_jason	jordan	I'm pretty sure it's been -safe-mode for a while, what does it say when you try?  invalid option?
2006-02-19T10:05:00.000Z	jordan	_jason	I did --safe-mode and it worked
2006-02-19T10:05:00.000Z	jordan	_jason	I'm trying to log into gmail right now
2006-02-19T10:07:00.000Z	_jason	jordan	probably not, I have used it fine with dial-up
2006-02-19T10:09:00.000Z	_jason	jordan	does google's html mode work?
2006-02-19T10:10:00.000Z	jordan	_jason	 I dont know how to access that without getting onto the inbox
2006-02-19T10:10:00.000Z	_jason	jordan	the link for me is: http://mail.google.com/mail/?ui=html&zy=f
2006-02-19T10:12:00.000Z	jordan	_jason	I'm trying that link right now
2006-02-19T10:12:00.000Z	jordan	_jason	its doing the same thing as the other link
2006-02-19T10:13:00.000Z	jordan	_jason	it worked it worked!
2006-02-19T10:15:00.000Z	_jason	jordan	now only if you could figure out why standard doesn't work... seems like it's javascript related.  But since it didn't work in safe mode it means it probably isn't a setting or extension issue
2006-02-19T10:16:00.000Z	jordan	_jason	I dont know, it didnt have the link to go to normal mode on the top like it usually does when you are in html, I just reinstalled firefox so I had to close it down but I am opening it back up now
2006-02-19T10:17:00.000Z	_jason	jordan	maybe it's the chat feature, that happens to coincide with the timing
2006-02-19T10:17:00.000Z	jordan	_jason	 it works really fast now, I dont know what gives, maybe it happened when I reinstalled java and didnt restart firefox
2006-02-19T10:18:00.000Z	_jason	jordan	oh, maybe
2006-02-19T10:18:00.000Z	jordan	_jason	I've been using ubuntu full time for 3 months now, it was difficult to get dial-up to work for me
2006-02-19T10:19:00.000Z	_jason	jordan	yeah, when I'm home I have to use windows.  My modem driver costs like 15 bucks a year which I am not going to pay
2006-03-17T15:45:00.000Z	_jason	jordan	you have gaim in applications menu > internet
