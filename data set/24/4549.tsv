2007-03-16T05:18:00.000Z	VeganChick		I want to go to Feisty, but I don't want to risk losing my Mac partition...
2007-03-16T05:18:00.000Z	jrib	VeganChick	then back it up.  Feisty is not stable, your computer could explode
2007-03-16T05:20:00.000Z	VeganChick	jrib	I would back it up, but I don't have an extra hd right now...I really need to buy one...
2007-03-16T05:22:00.000Z	jrib	VeganChick	I wouldn't recommend upgrading to feisty if you have important data without backups.  Wait for Feisty to be released as stable in April.  I would still really recommend backups of some kind for your data, don't wait until you lose important data to decide to start keeping backups, trust me
2007-03-16T06:22:00.000Z	jrib	VeganChick	ignore it
2007-03-16T08:23:00.000Z	jrib	VeganChick	it's already installed
2007-03-16T08:23:00.000Z	VeganChick	jrib	how do I use it then?
2007-03-16T08:24:00.000Z	jrib	VeganChick	it's used everytime you use a gtk application.  It's responsible for the widgets (buttons, progress bars, etc...).  What are you trying to do?
2007-03-16T08:24:00.000Z	jrib	VeganChick	do you just want to theme them?
2007-03-16T08:25:00.000Z	VeganChick	jrib	I want to modify an engine. (sorry, my words aren't working tonight...)
2007-03-16T08:26:00.000Z	jrib	VeganChick	I'm not sure I understand what you want to do.  You want to get source code, edit it, and compile it?  Or are you just trying to change the way things look?
2007-03-16T08:29:00.000Z	VeganChick	jrib	I want to change the way things look, but I couldn't find a theme I liked
2007-03-16T09:52:00.000Z	jrib	VeganChick	what are you compiling?
2007-03-16T09:53:00.000Z	jrib	VeganChick	why?  Those are all packaged and in the repositories
2007-03-16T09:54:00.000Z	jrib	VeganChick	yes, why do you want glib, pango, atk, and gtk+?
2007-03-16T09:55:00.000Z	jrib	VeganChick	no, all you need is a text editor to customize themes.  See http://live.gnome.org/GnomeArt/Tutorials
2007-03-16T09:55:00.000Z	jrib	VeganChick	I think I told you this before, but I'm not sure:  you usually just want to go to a site like gnome-look.org and use one of those
2007-03-16T09:56:00.000Z	VeganChick	jrib	sorry, I got conflicting advice at #ubuntu-effects
2007-03-16T09:57:00.000Z	jrib	VeganChick	go to the link I gave you
2007-03-16T09:57:00.000Z	jrib	VeganChick	(the first one, not gnome-look)
2007-03-16T09:58:00.000Z	VeganChick	jrib	thanks for being patient with me! i'm a ditz.
2007-03-16T09:59:00.000Z	jrib	VeganChick	that's ok we were all there once
2007-03-16T10:00:00.000Z	VeganChick	jrib	I found what made me think I needed gtk...
2007-03-16T10:01:00.000Z	jrib	VeganChick	that's asking for the gtk development package.  libgtk2.0-dev probably
