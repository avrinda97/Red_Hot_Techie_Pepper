2009-02-04T06:34:00.000Z	gaintsura		O.o I can't bring my screen brightness up or down, any ideas?
2009-02-04T06:35:00.000Z	gaintsura		correction, all of my function keys are messed up
2009-02-04T06:35:00.000Z	zelrikriando	gaintsura	did you try with the tool on the taskbar?
2009-02-04T06:35:00.000Z	zelrikriando	gaintsura	are you using a laptop
2009-02-04T06:36:00.000Z	gaintsura	zelrikriando	yes I'm using a laptop.. and there is no tool on my taskbar, if you'd call it that
2009-02-04T06:37:00.000Z	zelrikriando	gaintsura	you should add the tool....right click 'Add to Panel'
2009-02-04T06:37:00.000Z	gaintsura	zelrikriando	I dont have a panel
2009-02-04T06:37:00.000Z	gaintsura		=P

2009-02-04T06:37:00.000Z	gaintsura		s/nameo f/tool
2009-02-04T06:38:00.000Z	gaintsura	zelrikriando	thats not very helpful.. I'm not going to modify my desktop for an application
2009-02-04T06:38:00.000Z	zelrikriando	gaintsura	'brightness applet'
2009-02-04T06:38:00.000Z	zelrikriando	gaintsura	on gnome
2009-02-04T06:39:00.000Z	gaintsura	zelrikriando	this pertains to a larger problem than just my brightness. none of my Fn keys work
2009-02-04T06:39:00.000Z	zelrikriando	gaintsura	I know, I had the same kind of problem
2009-02-04T06:39:00.000Z	gaintsura		and it pertains to brightness applet?
2009-02-04T06:40:00.000Z	gaintsura		O.o
2009-02-04T06:40:00.000Z	zelrikriando	gaintsura	the brightness applet will be a temporary fix as it works better than the Fn key
2009-02-04T06:40:00.000Z	gaintsura	zelrikriando	I don't need a temporary fix,
2009-02-04T06:40:00.000Z	gaintsura		but thanks =)
2009-02-04T06:41:00.000Z	zelrikriando	gaintsura	if you find a permanent one, tell me, I am interested
2009-02-04T06:42:00.000Z	zelrikriando	gaintsura	and I think you should be patient because I had that issue for a while and never found a bulletproof fix
2009-02-04T06:43:00.000Z	zelrikriando	gaintsura	I think some of my fn keys work though
