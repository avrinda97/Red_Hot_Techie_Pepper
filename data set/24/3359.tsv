2008-02-13T06:37:00.000Z	aO|DB		Can anyone help me with manually partitioning and installing Ubuntu?? I am at the screen now, and I have 23 Gigs for linux, 400mb for a swap
2008-02-13T06:38:00.000Z	Pelo	aO|DB	 I recommend  5-10 gig for the root partiton in ext3,  2xram for swap and the rest for /home in ext3
2008-02-13T06:39:00.000Z	aO|DB	Pelo	can you help me with the specifics at all?
2008-02-13T06:39:00.000Z	Pelo	aO|DB	 whatspecifics do you need to know about ?
2008-02-13T06:41:00.000Z	Pelo	aO|DB	make a first partiton in ext3  5 to 10 gig , you will use it for your root filesystem , where the OS will be iinstalled,  after that make one that is twice the size of your RAM for your swap , the rest you use for /home in ext3
2008-02-13T06:41:00.000Z	Pelo	aO|DB	montpoints will come later in the next screen
2008-02-13T06:41:00.000Z	Pelo	aO|DB	 your choice
2008-02-13T06:43:00.000Z	aO|DB	Pelo	what does it mean Primary or Logical, and Beginning or End
2008-02-13T06:44:00.000Z	Pelo	aO|DB	if you only have ubuntu on that hdd use primary , don't worry about beginning and end,  just use the size bits
2008-02-13T06:47:00.000Z	aO|DB	Pelo	do i make the Home first, then make the Root??? because it is not letting me create anything else after making the primary
2008-02-13T06:49:00.000Z	Pelo	aO|DB	you'll get the hang of it eventualy, you only do one thing at once, if it helps you can exit the installer and go back to the deskop ,  you can partition your hdd from gparted in there and do the insetall after,   you can then skip the bit where you partiton and go straight to the part where you pick the partitons to instal on
2008-02-13T06:51:00.000Z	Pelo	aO|DB	you do the manual partitionning bit but then you donT' have to do the partitons in the step you are now , they are already there, you can skip to the next bit I mean
2008-02-13T06:51:00.000Z	Pelo	aO|DB	anyting esle on this hdd ?
2008-02-13T06:52:00.000Z	Pelo	aO|DB	 ok  fist please use my nick in each line,  it makes it easier to follow if I know you are talking to me
2008-02-13T06:53:00.000Z	Pelo	aO|DB	you will need to make logical partitons , not primaries,  you can only have 4 primaries per hdd
2008-02-13T06:55:00.000Z	Pelo	aO|DB	right click in the free space showed in the  graphical repersentation of the hdd,  select new partiton or whatever it is ,  make a new one  5 gig , ext3 , logical
2008-02-13T06:57:00.000Z	Pelo	aO|DB	still around ?
2008-02-13T06:58:00.000Z	aO|DB	Pelo	I just made 2 Parts, 5GB EX3 Primary, 300MB Swap... made the EX3 /
2008-02-13T06:59:00.000Z	Pelo	aO|DB	 I was gonna suggest you use the rest of the free space for /home in ext3
2008-02-13T07:01:00.000Z	Pelo	aO|DB	yes ?
2008-02-13T07:01:00.000Z	aO|DB	Pelo	i think it automatically puts that space in the partition
2008-02-13T07:02:00.000Z	Pelo	aO|DB	is this your first ubuntu install ? meaning your first linux ?
2008-02-13T07:02:00.000Z	Pelo	aO|DB	mind if I hand you over to nickrud ?  I realy have to go
2008-02-13T07:04:00.000Z	Pelo	aO|DB	consider you might have a hidden  recovery partition on your hdd,  which would show as free space in gparted but would not be usable
