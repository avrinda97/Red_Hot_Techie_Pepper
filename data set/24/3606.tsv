2007-12-28T23:01:00.000Z	FastZ		Hey folks, I'm having problems getting sound to work on an HP Pavilion dv6626us laptop that's running Ubuntu 7.10 Gutsy.  I have read a lot of information and have noticed that a lot of people have had sound problems with the HP dv6000 series laptops.  This particular model uses the ICH8 family onboard audio device.  Anyone in here can point me in a good direction to figure out a fix for this?
2007-12-28T23:01:00.000Z	david_J	FastZ	You may need to compile alsa yourself
2007-12-28T23:02:00.000Z	david_J	FastZ	What is the moudle you are trying to use?
2007-12-28T23:04:00.000Z	FastZ	david_J	 I've read where one individual did just that and it failed to fix his problem.  I haven't tried that route yet, so I won't rule that one out.  I'm not sure what module I'm trying to use.  Just trying to get the sound to work.  The output for lspci | grep Audio is 00:1b.0 Audio device:  Intel Corp. 82801H (ICH8 Family) HD Audio Controller (rev 03)
2007-12-28T23:04:00.000Z	david_J	FastZ	if it is snd_hda_intel, I had to download the latest alsa and install and pass some options to the module
2007-12-28T23:05:00.000Z	david_J	FastZ	looks like mine
2007-12-28T23:05:00.000Z	FastZ	david_J	 was there a set of instructions that you followed or did you know what you were doing?  this is the first time I've had to troubleshoot sound on a laptop running linux so I'm partially in the dark on this
2007-12-28T23:06:00.000Z	david_J	FastZ	I lost the bookmark for it.. In fact I got the answer from a SuSE forum
2007-12-28T23:07:00.000Z	david_J	FastZ	google lead me there
2007-12-28T23:10:00.000Z	FastZ	david_J	 does this look somewhat like what you had done?  http://www.suseforums.net/index.php?showtopic=27776#
2007-12-28T23:13:00.000Z	david_J	FastZ	not really
2007-12-28T23:13:00.000Z	david_J	FastZ	I can tell you to get alsa-driver > 0.15, alsa-utils, alsa-oss
2007-12-28T23:14:00.000Z	david_J	FastZ	but I'll need to look up what options you have to pass to the module
2007-12-28T23:14:00.000Z	FastZ	david_J	 I guess I'll keep searching around a bit then.
2007-12-28T23:15:00.000Z	FastZ	david_J	I've already installed the linux-backports-modules and that doesnt seem to make a difference
2007-12-28T23:15:00.000Z	david_J	FastZ	Once you know what options to pass to the module is the /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base
2007-12-28T23:15:00.000Z	david_J	FastZ	you should be good
2007-12-28T23:16:00.000Z	david_J	FastZ	I'll nopaste my file to give you a idea... maybe there'll be some documentation in the alsa-driver tree
2007-12-28T23:16:00.000Z	david_J	FastZ	to help you out on what options need to be passed
2007-12-28T23:16:00.000Z	david_J	FastZ	http://rafb.net/p/Bk7k7Q32.html
2007-12-28T23:18:00.000Z	david_J	FastZ	All I can do is tell you what I did
2007-12-28T23:22:00.000Z	FastZ	david_J	 thanks for the link
2007-12-28T23:23:00.000Z	david_J	FastZ	your wirless card work too?
2007-12-28T23:25:00.000Z	FastZ	david_J	 the wireless worked out of the box perfectly.  the only thing I have noticed that's borked is the sound.  Have read that the built-in webcam doesnt work out of the box but that's not a big issue right this minute.  Sound is though, so I'm trying to figure that out
