2007-11-05T03:58:00.000Z	jrib	webpirate	what *is* the problem?
2007-11-05T03:58:00.000Z	jrib	webpirate	yes
2007-11-05T03:58:00.000Z	jrib	webpirate	tell me what I am looking for
2007-11-05T04:01:00.000Z	jrib	webpirate	ah, you need to change the resolution for the login screen then.  google suggests just removing all of the resolutions you do not use from your xorg.conf...

2007-11-05T04:57:00.000Z	jrib	webpirate	I didn't suggest a command...
2007-11-05T04:57:00.000Z	jrib	webpirate	did you try my suggestion?
2007-11-05T04:57:00.000Z	jrib	webpirate	had what?
2007-11-05T04:58:00.000Z	jrib	webpirate	that isn't what I suggested.  Did you read the link I gave you?
2007-11-05T04:59:00.000Z	jrib	webpirate	no... https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FixVideoResolutionHowto#head-9a8fa8e79e2458de1eb69eadb2c97a633be81a42
2007-11-05T05:00:00.000Z	jrib	webpirate	you reordered the resolutions and it still uses the wrong one?
2007-11-05T05:01:00.000Z	jrib	webpirate	how do you know it uses the right one?
2007-11-05T05:03:00.000Z	jrib	webpirate	LCDs have a native resolution.  laptops have two modes.  In one mode they will stretch things when the resolution is too small.  In the other mode, they will do what you are seeing.  It definitely seems like the resolution is the issue.  Why not try the suggestion and see?
2007-11-05T05:04:00.000Z	jrib	webpirate	did you try to delete all resolutions except the proper one?
