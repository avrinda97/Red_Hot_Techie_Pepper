2011-02-09T10:19:00.000Z	Vitasoy		Hello I was wondering if anyone was free to answer some questions about crontab for me
2011-02-09T10:19:00.000Z	b4sh	Vitasoy	dont ask to ask but whats your question?
2011-02-09T10:20:00.000Z	Vitasoy	b4sh	i can't seem to get my cron jobs to run with the @reboot command or my shell scripts to run is what i mean
2011-02-09T10:20:00.000Z	Vitasoy	b4sh	I am on ubuntu 10.10 64bit / I think they are running before it is booted correctly?
2011-02-09T10:20:00.000Z	b4sh	Vitasoy	can you put the relavant cron entries and scripts in pastebin?
2011-02-09T10:21:00.000Z	Vitasoy	b4sh	sure
2011-02-09T10:23:00.000Z	Vitasoy	b4sh	http://paste.ubuntu.com/564824/
2011-02-09T10:23:00.000Z	b4sh	Vitasoy	cool I will take a look
2011-02-09T10:24:00.000Z	b4sh	Vitasoy	where are you putting the shell script?
2011-02-09T10:24:00.000Z	Vitasoy	b4sh	in ~/shellscripts
2011-02-09T10:24:00.000Z	Vitasoy	b4sh	I am logged in under ryan
2011-02-09T10:26:00.000Z	b4sh	Vitasoy	you want them to run at startup yes?
2011-02-09T10:26:00.000Z	Vitasoy	b4sh	correct
2011-02-09T10:26:00.000Z	b4sh	Vitasoy	use rc.local then
2011-02-09T10:27:00.000Z	Vitasoy	b4sh	okay, I tried that earlier didn't work for me either. Is there a reason why it doesn't work as a cron job?
2011-02-09T10:29:00.000Z	b4sh	Vitasoy	Im not familiar with the @reboot command although I assume it would need a call to the init reboot script as opposed to shutdown -r which could be the problem
2011-02-09T10:30:00.000Z	Vitasoy	b4sh	makes sense, also can shell scripts be ran with sudo commands if the file is owned by root? say "apt-get update -y"
2011-02-09T10:31:00.000Z	b4sh	Vitasoy	yes you can put sudo in your scripts and it will prompt you for sudo auth
2011-02-09T10:31:00.000Z	Vitasoy	b4sh	but if I don't want them to prompt me, I want it to already have access so I don't have to be at my machine, what should I do?
2011-02-09T10:32:00.000Z	b4sh	Vitasoy	use keys
2011-02-09T10:32:00.000Z	Vitasoy	b4sh	I'm a little lost, I'm a newbie=x what do you mean by use keys
2011-02-09T10:33:00.000Z	b4sh		!kerberos | Vitasoy
2011-02-09T10:34:00.000Z	b4sh	Vitasoy	look up kerberos authentication and ssh keys tbh its alot to go into
2011-02-09T10:34:00.000Z	Vitasoy	b4sh	sounds good thanks for your help
