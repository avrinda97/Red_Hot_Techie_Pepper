2004-12-09T17:58:00.000Z	Matt|	paper	its worse than that

2004-12-09T17:58:00.000Z	Matt|	paper	just kidding
2004-12-09T17:58:00.000Z	Matt|	paper	it's not a problem, what he means is that when the collection of packages in "ubuntu-desktop" changes, you won't get the benefit of that change. But it's not an issue - if you know what you want, it's better to add and remove packages manually
2004-12-09T17:58:00.000Z	paper	Matt|	so basically an apt-get update will not update what specific packages? is there anywhere i can see like a dependency tree?
2004-12-09T17:59:00.000Z	Matt|	paper	ubuntu-desktop is like a virtual package which contains the programs which ubuntu decide to include in their standard desktop. If you remove the package, it will not hurt your system, just that when they change what is in their standard desktop, you will not get the benefit of the changes. It is fine to remove it if you know what programs you want to use.
