2008-10-06T21:41:00.000Z	homy		hello. In Openoffice.org, when I select 100% zoom level in the toolbar, the page displayed is not original size. It is bigger than a paper of that size.
2008-10-06T21:42:00.000Z	dury	homy	it is
2008-10-06T21:43:00.000Z	homy	dury	no, it isn't. I can hold a paper a5 on the screen, but the document displayed is not the same size, even though it is also a5!
2008-10-06T21:44:00.000Z	dury	homy	what kind of screen and resolution you have?
2008-10-06T21:48:00.000Z	dury	homy	did you solve it?
2008-10-06T21:48:00.000Z	homy	dury	I have "acer x223w" widescreen monitor 1680x1050 pixel.
2008-10-06T21:48:00.000Z	homy	dury	no, I didn't
2008-10-06T21:51:00.000Z	dury	homy	gesss what could be the problem..... you think?
2008-10-06T21:51:00.000Z	homy	dury	but its a normal 22" wide screen monitor!
2008-10-06T21:51:00.000Z	homy	dury	maybe I have to find the dpi in the manual and set it somewhere in openoffice?
2008-10-06T21:52:00.000Z	dury	homy	did you try printing in a A4 paper?
2008-10-06T21:53:00.000Z	homy	dury	no it's not about printing. The page shows in a wrong size when it is displayed on the screen.
2008-10-06T21:53:00.000Z	homy	dury	by the way, it is displayed correctly with evince if I "create pdf" in openoffice
2008-10-06T21:54:00.000Z	dury	homy	right..... never had that kind of hazel
2008-10-06T21:55:00.000Z	homy	dury	why not?
2008-10-06T21:55:00.000Z	dury	homy	I'm going to open OO
2008-10-06T21:55:00.000Z	homy	dury	go ahead :)
2008-10-06T21:58:00.000Z	dury	homy	my paper format in OO it's A4 (page Style)
2008-10-06T21:59:00.000Z	dury	homy	menu Format/Page.. then page tab
2008-10-06T21:59:00.000Z	homy	dury	yes, I can also set it to a4. But when I hold a piece of a4 paper on my screen, I see that openoffice displays the document too large.
2008-10-06T22:00:00.000Z	dury	homy	gesssss......... I don't know what it is
2008-10-06T22:00:00.000Z	dury	homy	sorry dude :(
2008-10-06T22:02:00.000Z	dury	homy	recon69 it's right I guess
2008-10-06T22:03:00.000Z	dury	homy	do that
