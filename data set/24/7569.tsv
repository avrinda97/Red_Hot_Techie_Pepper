2005-08-10T09:09:00.000Z	dv__		is there a "native linux/unix widget set"?
2005-08-10T09:09:00.000Z	dv__		like in Windows
2005-08-10T09:09:00.000Z	dv__		there is one
2005-08-10T09:09:00.000Z	dv__		and in OSX there is cocoa
2005-08-10T09:09:00.000Z	topyli	dv__	we have several
2005-08-10T09:10:00.000Z	dv__		so the actual reference toolkit would be motif, right?
2005-08-10T09:10:00.000Z	topyli		athena!
2005-08-10T09:10:00.000Z	dv__		i read once that motif is the native widgets toolkit for unix
2005-08-10T09:11:00.000Z	dv__		now that sounds weird
2005-08-10T09:11:00.000Z	dv__		:D
2005-08-10T09:11:00.000Z	topyli	dv__	it used to be the toolkit for CDE and other such old stuff
2005-08-10T09:12:00.000Z	dv__	karlwrk	it does, actually
2005-08-10T09:12:00.000Z	dv__		you dont draw your own widgets usually
2005-08-10T09:12:00.000Z	dv__		the system does this for you
2005-08-10T09:12:00.000Z	dv__		yes
2005-08-10T09:13:00.000Z	dv__		i dont mean mfc
2005-08-10T09:13:00.000Z	dv__		I mean the raw win32 api
2005-08-10T09:13:00.000Z	dv__		and there *are* UI functions
2005-08-10T09:13:00.000Z	dv__		which every app uses
2005-08-10T09:13:00.000Z	dv__		well, almost every app
2005-08-10T09:13:00.000Z	dv__		some cross-platform apps draw their own apps, which looks very ugly
2005-08-10T09:14:00.000Z	dv__		because it doesnt fit with the rest
2005-08-10T09:15:00.000Z	dv__		yes, and fltk/gtk/qt/motif/athena/fox all draw things their way
2005-08-10T09:15:00.000Z	topyli	dv__	on linux you can get a nice, chaotic desktop by using motif, qt and gtk apps, along with emacs and other old athena-based X apps :)
