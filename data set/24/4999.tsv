2008-05-15T03:32:00.000Z	robert__		i need help unlocking a folder
2008-05-15T03:33:00.000Z	Slart	robert__	chmod and chown are good friends to have
2008-05-15T03:34:00.000Z	Slart	robert__	they are included in your install.. chmod changes permissions on files and folders
2008-05-15T03:34:00.000Z	Slart	robert__	chown changes ownership of files and folders
2008-05-15T03:34:00.000Z	Slart	robert__	where is this folder you need to unlock?
2008-05-15T03:37:00.000Z	Slart	robert__	hm.. updating pb?... ok, run this command "sudo chmod a+rw -R ~/.etwolf"
2008-05-15T03:38:00.000Z	Slart	robert__	a+rw means give all users read and write rights.. -R means recursive.. sudo is probably not needed but you never know
2008-05-15T03:45:00.000Z	Slart	robert__	then there might be some other problem..
2008-05-15T03:46:00.000Z	Slart	robert__	I've been playing et for several years now.. never had problems with pb on linux.. how did you install it?
2008-05-15T03:46:00.000Z	Slart	robert__	but.. isn't it included in the et install?
2008-05-15T03:48:00.000Z	Slart	robert__	you are running the linux version? not using wine or something like that?
2008-05-15T03:49:00.000Z	Slart	robert__	just plain "et" ?
2008-05-15T03:51:00.000Z	Slart	robert__	hmm..very weird.. after that chmod command you should be able to write to all the files in the .etwolf folder...
2008-05-15T03:54:00.000Z	Slart	robert__	hm.. updating pb?... ok, run this command "sudo chmod a+rw -R ~/.etwolf"
2008-06-03T03:31:00.000Z	Slart	robert__	afaik you'll have to set it to open all the formats one by one
2008-06-03T03:32:00.000Z	Slart	robert__	right click on a media-file in nautilux.. properties.. open with
2008-06-03T03:32:00.000Z	Slart	robert__	afaik = as far as I know
2008-06-03T03:32:00.000Z	Slart	robert__	I don't know of a way to do it from the terminal
2008-06-03T04:23:00.000Z	Slart	robert__	for default media player?
2008-06-03T04:23:00.000Z	Slart	robert__	come on.. tell us =)
2008-06-03T04:24:00.000Z	Slart	robert__	ahh.. that looks neat..
2008-06-03T04:29:00.000Z	Slart	robert__	I think I read something about a utility that did that.. can't really remember what it was called
2009-06-04T02:26:00.000Z	Slart	robert__	one is a term that is well defined on the wikipedia and the other is a.. oh .. my bad.. they're both well defined on wikipedia ;)
2009-06-04T02:27:00.000Z	Slart	robert__	search for "desktop enviroment", and "window manager".. those articles are pretty good
