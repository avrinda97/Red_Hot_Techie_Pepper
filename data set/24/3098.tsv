2008-04-30T16:01:00.000Z	mrthundercleese4	Uplink	I belive all that you need to do is creat two partitions on that free space one as ext 3 and one as swap make the swap file the smaller of the two, as this is basically pagefile
2008-04-30T16:02:00.000Z	Uplink	mrthundercleese4	what about the /root?
2008-04-30T16:02:00.000Z	mrthundercleese4	Uplink	suposedly 8.04 is easier to install
