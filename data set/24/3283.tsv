2008-03-07T02:04:00.000Z	filthpig	Linux_Fresher	my / partition is 5 gb and there's no problem, prolly got 3 or 4 gb in use.. then again, I have 240 gb on /home :)
2008-03-07T02:04:00.000Z	Linux_Fresher	filthpig	 erm .. so home has to be another drive than the OS installation drive? =/
2008-03-07T02:06:00.000Z	Linux_Fresher	filthpig	 ok before i get confused and drop the plan, i have one 80 GB hard drive .. 13 GBs free .. can give 5 gbs to Ubuntu  .. second hard disk is 40 GB divided as 20 gb and 20 gb .. filled with windowz programs and videos movies etc .. cannot be emptied or used right now
2008-03-07T02:06:00.000Z	filthpig	Linux_Fresher	all I'm saying is that it'll work just fine, as long as you dont intend to save tons of stuff on the partition :)
2008-03-07T02:06:00.000Z	Linux_Fresher	filthpig	:) that would do
2008-03-07T02:07:00.000Z	filthpig	Linux_Fresher	and you CAN read/write on NTFS/FAT disks from ubuntu, so there's no big problem..
2008-03-07T02:07:00.000Z	Linux_Fresher	filthpig	 okies !! clicking on the install icon !! hopefully this chat doesnt get stopped while installing .. will u be around for next 30 mins or so ? [ how long it would take for this install with default basic packeges ]
2008-03-07T02:08:00.000Z	filthpig	Linux_Fresher	depends on your hw, but I'd say about 20-30 mins or so.. And everything will work as it should during install :)
2008-03-07T02:08:00.000Z	Linux_Fresher	filthpig	 oh NTFS cant be used to write .. thats what the CD documentation said .. so ubuntu loads NTFS as read only .. fat32 is no problem for linux  [all this from documentation that comes with cd]
2008-03-07T02:09:00.000Z	Linux_Fresher	filthpig	 cool !! but now remember !! u r my basic support pillar !! dont run away please for next 1/2 hour
2008-03-07T02:09:00.000Z	filthpig	Linux_Fresher	yes it can, I've done it several times. That should be default from 7.10..
2008-03-07T02:10:00.000Z	filthpig	Linux_Fresher	I'll hang around, but I don't expect any problems for your install
2008-03-07T02:10:00.000Z	Linux_Fresher	filthpig	 thanks m8
2008-03-07T02:13:00.000Z	Linux_Fresher	filthpig	 just before i start, could we clear the disparity about NTFS please? how can be the documentation that came with this downloaded iso image CD is wrong ? its downloaded from a very proper source given on www.ubuntu.com .. no issues there .. i mean its not a fake ubuntu installation i think
2008-03-07T02:14:00.000Z	filthpig	Linux_Fresher	it's probably just a slip up when updating the documentation from 7.04, ntfs-write wasn't enabled back then
2008-03-07T02:15:00.000Z	Linux_Fresher	filthpig	 ah ! np .. starting installation now
2008-03-07T02:17:00.000Z	filthpig	Linux_Fresher	I've used the ntfs-3g driver for, well, at least a year, and never had any problems reading or writing to ntfs.. but there's no guarantee, though, so be sure to back-up your essentials from the ntfs drives as a precation
2008-03-07T02:23:00.000Z	Linux_Fresher	filthpig	 just till the install procedure can i please pm you ? chat is not full screen and is scrolling real fast
2008-03-07T02:25:00.000Z	filthpig	Linux_Fresher	sure, but I'm on the phone atm
2008-03-07T02:57:00.000Z	Linux_Fresher	filthpig	 < ---- OWNZ .. just saved me from massive data loss  .. have burnt my fingers bad in linux installation before .. it almost happened again
