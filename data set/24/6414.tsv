2006-11-24T17:05:00.000Z	sn9	Seveas	you're a high-ranking ubuntu guy -- ever hear of liborbit2 becoming non-functional upon a breezy-to-dapper upgrade?
2006-11-24T17:06:00.000Z	Seveas	sn9	nope
2006-11-24T17:06:00.000Z	sn9	Seveas	well, it appears to have happened to me
2006-11-24T17:07:00.000Z	sn9	Seveas	it's making firefox do a SIGILL, and i suspect it's what's causing synaptic to crash too
2006-11-24T17:07:00.000Z	Seveas	sn9	funky, tried reinstalling the thing?
2006-11-24T17:07:00.000Z	sn9	Seveas	liborbit2? yes. and firefox, too
2006-11-24T17:07:00.000Z	Seveas	sn9	and how did you determine it to be liborbit?
2006-11-24T17:07:00.000Z	sn9	Seveas	gdb
2006-11-24T17:08:00.000Z	Seveas	sn9	can you pastebin the gdb output please
2006-11-24T17:09:00.000Z	sn9	Seveas	well, i no longer have the window open, but i can recreate the backtrace. also, this is on a powerpc (g3)
2006-11-24T17:17:00.000Z	sn9	Seveas	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33560/
2006-11-24T17:18:00.000Z	Seveas	sn9	that output seems incomplete
2006-11-24T17:19:00.000Z	sn9	Seveas	what's missing? looks ok to me
2006-11-24T17:19:00.000Z	Seveas	sn9	and try disabling assistive technologies/accessibility things
2006-11-24T17:20:00.000Z	sn9	Seveas	i'll have to log out for that, but now that you mention it, gok fails to start, complaining about a missing /dev/js0
2006-11-24T17:20:00.000Z	Seveas	sn9	well, it's the backtrace of only one thread and the actual signal is missing ;)
2006-11-24T17:21:00.000Z	sn9	Seveas	it's the thread that got the signal
2006-11-24T17:21:00.000Z	Seveas	sn9	fair enough ;)
2006-11-24T17:21:00.000Z	sn9	Seveas	the top line refers to the illegal instruction
2006-11-24T17:27:00.000Z	sn9	Seveas	i'll give turning off assistive devices a try now, and then i'm going to thanksgiving dinner with family and friends of family, so i won't be able to report back until another day. which channel would be the best one to receive such a report?
2006-11-24T17:27:00.000Z	Seveas	sn9	here
2006-11-24T17:28:00.000Z	Seveas	sn9	or a private /msg :)
2006-11-24T17:28:00.000Z	sn9	Seveas	to you? ok...
2006-11-24T17:29:00.000Z	sn9	Seveas	well, later...
