2009-02-14T12:41:00.000Z	sdlwof		how do i go back to my old video drivers? windows takes more then 1 second to redraw on the screen when i move them across the desktop, or scroll webpages.
2009-02-14T12:42:00.000Z	bigbrovar	sdlwof	are you using a restricted driver?
2009-02-14T12:43:00.000Z	sdlwof	bigbrovar	no i am not.
2009-02-14T12:43:00.000Z	sdlwof	bigbrovar	i tried using dual displays, and now i unhooked the 2nd monitor, rebooted, and now i'm in chaos.
2009-02-14T12:43:00.000Z	bigbrovar	sdlwof	i was wondering what u meant by "old video driver"
2009-02-14T12:44:00.000Z	sdlwof	bigbrovar	the one that worked better? something changed. I can't enable desktop effects. says it's unable to enable.
2009-02-14T12:45:00.000Z	bigbrovar	sdlwof	have you tried check screen resolutions under /systems/preference/screen resolutions
2009-02-14T12:45:00.000Z	sdlwof	bigbrovar	windows draw HORRIBLY slow, even xchat scrolling
2009-02-14T12:46:00.000Z	sdlwof	bigbrovar	i never changed screen resolutions. always been using the same res since the 6.x days
2009-02-14T12:47:00.000Z	bigbrovar	sdlwof	screen resolution does more than it name says .. it can also be used to configure and unconfigure a dual screen setup
2009-02-14T12:47:00.000Z	sdlwof	bigbrovar	yes. i used it and removed the dual screen setup, rebooted, and now i have poor display performance.
2009-02-14T12:48:00.000Z	sdlwof	bigbrovar	the only fix i can think of is to format the drive and reinstall, but, i don't think i need to go such extreme.
2009-02-14T12:49:00.000Z	bigbrovar	sdlwof	no dont do that .. yet .. what graphic card are u using
2009-02-14T12:49:00.000Z	sdlwof	bigbrovar	intel graphics media accelerator 900
2009-02-14T12:50:00.000Z	sdlwof	bigbrovar	it was totally fine before, shadows, transparencies, compiz effects, all fast and clean and quick. now i can't get it enabled, and seems like 2d display is straight up murder. 2.2ghz too....
2009-02-14T12:50:00.000Z	bigbrovar	sdlwof	ok try this .. put in an ubuntu life cd .. and replace the xorg.conf file with the one in the life cd .. that is what i do most of the time and it always work
2009-02-14T12:51:00.000Z	sdlwof	bigbrovar	wonder if there's the generic live one posted somewhere on the 'net...
2009-02-14T12:53:00.000Z	bigbrovar	sdlwof	they could be .. but ubuntu auto configure xorg to suit ur machine needs .. that is why a generic xorg config might not fit it
2009-02-14T12:54:00.000Z	bigbrovar	sdlwof	ok why not paste bin your xorg.conf
2009-02-14T12:59:00.000Z	bigbrovar	sdlwof	sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg
2009-02-14T13:03:00.000Z	bigbrovar	sdlwof	sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg
2009-02-14T13:05:00.000Z	sdlwof	bigbrovar	just prings debconf: DbDriver "config": /var/cache/debconf/config.dat is locked by another process: Resource temporarily unavailable
2009-02-14T13:10:00.000Z	bigbrovar	sdlwof	any luck?
2009-02-14T13:16:00.000Z	sdlwof	bigbrovar	i got it back!!!
