2006-12-09T14:24:00.000Z	nn		From another machine on the network (dsl not ubuntu) how do i connect to the X login on my ubuntu box (which does allow remote logins by my configuration)
2006-12-09T14:24:00.000Z	Arwen	nn	you need a client to login over network.... if its not built in, you'll have to find one and compile it
2006-12-09T14:25:00.000Z	nn	Arwen	hmm, what kind of "client"?
2006-12-09T14:25:00.000Z	Arwen	nn	a login client....
2006-12-09T14:25:00.000Z	nn	Arwen	yea, but such as? :)
2006-12-09T14:26:00.000Z	Arwen	nn	no idea - both gnome and kde have one built-in, but....
2006-12-09T14:27:00.000Z	Arwen	nn	not very scary
2006-12-09T14:27:00.000Z	nn	Arwen	ext2ntfs 0.5 is a great driver, if you can get it setup
2006-12-09T14:28:00.000Z	Arwen	nn	does it support ext3 journals?
2006-12-09T14:28:00.000Z	nn	Arwen	No, it just ignores the journal
2006-12-09T14:28:00.000Z	Arwen	nn	and I'm still trying to find a proper xfs driver
2006-12-09T14:28:00.000Z	nn	Arwen	which is harmless, really
2006-12-09T14:28:00.000Z	Arwen	nn	if it writes and ignores the journal?
2006-12-09T14:29:00.000Z	nn	Arwen	harmless, the journal is only for fs ops that arent fully completed
2006-12-09T14:29:00.000Z	Arwen	nn	so if you crash while writing?
2006-12-09T14:30:00.000Z	nn	Arwen	then you're gonna have to fsck, same as before the journal came around
2006-12-09T14:30:00.000Z	nn	Arwen	it works exactly how ext2 worked
2006-12-09T14:30:00.000Z	Arwen	nn	but will it be marked as dirty?
2006-12-09T14:30:00.000Z	nn	Arwen	that's debatable, personally any time i allowed a non kernel driver to write to my ext{2,3} fs, i'd force a fsck
2006-12-09T14:31:00.000Z	nn	Arwen	the drivers simply arent very mature yet
2006-12-09T14:31:00.000Z	Arwen	nn	and the drivers for xfs and reiser are non-existant....
2006-12-09T14:31:00.000Z	nn	Arwen	i gotta run, but i'll be back in a few hours if you care to continue this discussion
2006-12-09T14:31:00.000Z	nn	Arwen	yeup
2006-12-09T14:31:00.000Z	nn	Arwen	ext2/ext3's safest bet, but.. ymmv
