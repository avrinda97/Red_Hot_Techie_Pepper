2008-03-04T19:59:00.000Z	zossso	ender	Places->Network
2008-03-04T19:59:00.000Z	zossso	ender	or Places->Connect to Server..
2008-03-04T20:04:00.000Z	zossso	ender	well, that is kind of tricky.  basically linux mounts drives as folders, so yo just specify what folder to mount to.
2008-03-04T20:04:00.000Z	zossso	ender	If you want a nice link to it on your desktop, that is pretty easy
2008-03-04T20:04:00.000Z	ender	zossso	I just need a link that programs can "see"
2008-03-04T20:06:00.000Z	ender	zossso	will amarok see it?
2008-03-04T20:07:00.000Z	ender	zossso	or anything else for that matter other than just viewing
2008-03-04T20:07:00.000Z	zossso	ender	a better solution... the `smbmount` command
2008-03-04T20:08:00.000Z	ender	zossso	didn't know about that one, will try  do I just say smbmount //server/share ?
2008-03-04T20:09:00.000Z	zossso	ender	I think `smbmount //server/share <mountpoint>`
2008-03-04T20:09:00.000Z	zossso	ender	if you need a username/pw, there are some extra options you will need to specify
2008-03-04T20:10:00.000Z	zossso	ender	might need to `apt-get install smbfs`
2008-03-04T20:11:00.000Z	zossso	ender	np. `smbumount <mountpoint>`
2008-03-04T20:11:00.000Z	zossso	ender	nice.
2008-03-04T20:11:00.000Z	ender	zossso	danand: THANKS A TON!
2008-03-04T20:19:00.000Z	zossso	ender	look into xvncviewer
2008-03-04T20:19:00.000Z	zossso	ender	VNC is your best bet
2008-03-04T20:19:00.000Z	ender	zossso	alright thanks again
2008-03-04T20:20:00.000Z	zossso	ender	sure. got to go to class now. later.
2008-03-04T20:21:00.000Z	zossso	ender	*wishes I could just spend helping linux users*
2008-03-04T21:32:00.000Z	zossso	ender	find your fstab solution yet?
2008-03-04T21:34:00.000Z	zossso	ender	Tried this in fstab `//server/share /mnt/share smbfs ro,guest 0 0`
