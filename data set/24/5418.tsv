2006-08-06T08:04:00.000Z	Qwell		about freaking time...
2006-08-06T08:04:00.000Z	Qwell		50 minutes to partition one single 74GB drive
2006-08-06T08:05:00.000Z	sethk	Qwell	to create the file systems.  partitioning takes less than a second
2006-08-06T08:05:00.000Z	Qwell	sethk	the installer sat there, looking stupid the entire time :)
2006-08-06T08:05:00.000Z	sethk	Qwell	that may be, but it wasn't partitioning, it was creating the file systems.
2006-08-06T08:05:00.000Z	Qwell	sethk	semantics
2006-08-06T08:10:00.000Z	Qwell	sethk	That's an important question, for those people who live at high altitudes. ;)
2006-08-06T08:16:00.000Z	sethk	Qwell	sounds like the installer is using PIO mode for the hard drive.
2006-08-06T08:16:00.000Z	Qwell	sethk	It's scsi, if that matters
2006-08-06T08:17:00.000Z	sethk	Qwell	I meant that in some cases the install program reverts to a very slow method of accessing the disk, and it doesn't necessarily indicate that the thing will run slowly once the install completes.
2006-08-06T08:17:00.000Z	Qwell	sethk	right, of course
2006-08-06T08:17:00.000Z	sethk	Qwell	you could probably figure out which kernel module needs to be loaded to speed up the install, but by the time you figure it out the install would probably have finished.  :)
2006-08-06T08:18:00.000Z	Qwell	sethk	well, I'm doing a netboot, so I'm pretty much locked into a small env
2006-08-06T08:31:00.000Z	Qwell	sethk	still sure that's the problem? :)
2006-08-06T08:32:00.000Z	sethk	Qwell	I'm never sure of anything, but am I still sure what is which problem?  :)
2006-08-06T08:32:00.000Z	Qwell	sethk	of this taking forever ;)
2006-08-06T08:33:00.000Z	sethk	Qwell	that's absurd
2006-08-06T08:33:00.000Z	sethk	Qwell	is it banging away on the disk?
2006-08-06T08:33:00.000Z	sethk	Qwell	at that rate it will finish next month
2006-08-06T08:34:00.000Z	sethk	Qwell	that can't be explained by PIO mode.  PIO mode might be 1/4, or even 1/10 the speed of dma access, but what you are seeing is truly absurd
2006-08-06T08:35:00.000Z	Qwell	sethk	indeed
2006-08-06T08:35:00.000Z	sethk	Qwell	did you do anything extra, like tell it to do a complete surface scan?
2006-08-06T08:36:00.000Z	sethk	Qwell	go to sleep and hope it is finished by morning.  :)
2006-08-06T08:36:00.000Z	Qwell	sethk	can't sleep with this beast on :P
