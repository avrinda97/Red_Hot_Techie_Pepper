2012-07-03T00:30:00.000Z	peggys_mouse	escott	no luck. i think i'm dealing with an upgrade that failed in the middle.
2012-07-03T00:31:00.000Z	escott	peggys_mouse	boot a livecd, chroot in, and use apt to continue the upgrade/fix it. or just reinstall
2012-07-03T00:32:00.000Z	peggys_mouse	escott	thanks. i have 11.10 on a stick. can I use that or do i need 12.04 (which is what I was upgrading to)
2012-07-03T00:32:00.000Z	escott	peggys_mouse	either should be fine provided the machine architecture matches
2012-07-03T00:33:00.000Z	peggys_mouse	escott	thanks again.
2012-07-03T01:44:00.000Z	peggys_mouse	escott	i tried to install 12.04 by running the live cd and then editing /etc/apt/sources.list and running update/upgrade but the install ran out of space and it looks to me like it is trying to install into the virtual environment. what did I do wrong?
2012-07-03T01:45:00.000Z	escott	peggys_mouse	did you chroot into the installed system
2012-07-03T01:45:00.000Z	peggys_mouse	escott	no. how do i do that?
2012-07-03T01:45:00.000Z	escott	peggys_mouse	if not im about to explain to MissVera how one does a chroot
2012-07-03T01:53:00.000Z	peggys_mouse	escott	i think i need to reboot first.
2012-07-03T01:53:00.000Z	escott	peggys_mouse	why do you say that?
2012-07-03T01:56:00.000Z	peggys_mouse	escott	the install i was doing crashed because it ran out of room. i wanted to make sure to clear that up so these instructions had space to work. maybe i didn't need to but figured it wouldn't hurt.
2012-07-03T01:56:00.000Z	escott	peggys_mouse	ok
2012-07-03T02:09:00.000Z	peggys_mouse	escott	sorry this is taking forever. having trouble rebooting to live
2012-07-03T02:18:00.000Z	peggys_mouse	escott	the live cd is now hanging on the ubuntu screen. any ideas how to get around that?
2012-07-03T02:18:00.000Z	escott	peggys_mouse	hit the up arrow. what does it say?
2012-07-03T02:19:00.000Z	peggys_mouse	escott	nothing. just that same purple screen
2012-07-03T02:19:00.000Z	escott	peggys_mouse	try a cold reboot (full shutdown)
2012-07-03T02:19:00.000Z	peggys_mouse	escott	i have several times
2012-07-03T02:19:00.000Z	escott	peggys_mouse	it booted once, i see no reason why it shouldnt boot again
2012-07-03T02:20:00.000Z	peggys_mouse	escott	when i had that drive full problem, what drive where they talking about? not related i assume?
2012-07-03T02:20:00.000Z	escott	peggys_mouse	i dont know. i wasnt there :)
2012-07-03T02:25:00.000Z	peggys_mouse	escott	i think i'm hooped. will have to re-install. what a day.
2012-07-03T02:34:00.000Z	peggys_mouse	escott	thanks for all your help. i'm giving up for now. will come back tomorrow with a fresh head.
