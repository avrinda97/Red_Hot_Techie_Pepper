2011-11-10T16:31:00.000Z	zapper1		Could somebody take a look at this log http://paste.ubuntu.com/734107/ and tell me what is wrong? My laptop won't boot an this is driving me nuts!!
2011-11-10T16:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zapper1	at what poingt does it stop?
2011-11-10T16:34:00.000Z	zapper1	ActionParsnip	at boot it leaves me with a black screen doing normal boot, and shows some text if i boot in recovery, but it would freeze either
2011-11-10T16:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zapper1	what gpu do you use?
2011-11-10T16:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zapper1	did you upgrade from Natty to Oneiric?
2011-11-10T16:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zapper1	you may need to drop to root recovery console and run: nvidia-xconfig
2011-11-10T16:39:00.000Z	zapper1	ActionParsnip	the problem is that i can't get into recovery mode
2011-11-10T16:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zapper1	sure you can, hold shift at boot, select recovery mode, select root
2011-11-10T16:40:00.000Z	zapper1	ActionParsnip	no way, the laptop would freeze after i select that entry on grub, it would not get to the ncurses dialog where you select what kind of recovery task you want to do
2011-11-10T16:42:00.000Z	zapper1	ActionParsnip	the pastebin i posted earlier cotains the logs of two boots, the first through normal mode and the second in recovery mode
2011-11-10T16:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zapper1	then boot to liveCD and you can chroot
2011-11-10T16:43:00.000Z	zapper1	ActionParsnip	 i'm on livecd now, what should i do?
2011-11-10T16:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zapper1	http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2011/09/live-usb-sticking-grub-2-video/    instead of the grub install stuff run: sudo nvidia-xconfig
2011-11-10T16:52:00.000Z	zapper1	ActionParsnip	got this output http://paste.ubuntu.com/734125/ is it ok?
2011-11-10T16:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zapper1	if that's in the chroot, then yes it's fine
2011-11-10T16:53:00.000Z	zapper1	ActionParsnip	so now i  reboot and everything should work?
2011-11-10T16:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zapper1	maybe, try it :)
2011-11-10T17:01:00.000Z	zapper1	ActionParsnip	i have rebooted and nothing has changed
2011-11-10T17:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zapper1	hmm, ok remove the file from the partition
2011-11-10T17:03:00.000Z	zapper1	ActionParsnip	what file_
2011-11-10T17:09:00.000Z	zapper1	ActionParsnip	what file should i remove?
2011-11-10T17:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zapper1	the xorg.conf file you made
2011-11-10T17:13:00.000Z	zapper1	ActionParsnip	done. what now?
2011-11-10T17:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zapper1	not sure dude, could chroot and uninstall the proprietary driver and reboot
