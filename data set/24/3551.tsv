2008-01-04T10:01:00.000Z	briantumor	truna	so what's the problem?
2008-01-04T10:01:00.000Z	truna	briantumor	if i read those errors correctly, it says you have not space left, are they in the correct partition?

2008-01-04T10:03:00.000Z	truna	briantumor	do you notice that your /boot is 95% full?
2008-01-04T10:03:00.000Z	briantumor	truna	 why is that a problem, i didn't upgrade the kernel
2008-01-04T10:03:00.000Z	truna	briantumor	read the errors you pasted earlier carefully, in what it attempts to do in  /boot/
2008-01-04T10:04:00.000Z	briantumor	truna	what does it do? :\
2008-01-04T10:04:00.000Z	truna	briantumor	come on. .read it please
2008-01-04T10:04:00.000Z	briantumor	truna	update-initramfs: Generating /boot/initrd.img-2.6.20-16-generic
2008-01-04T10:04:00.000Z	truna	briantumor	 Generating /boot/initrd.img-2.6.20-16-generic  <--- see this?
2008-01-04T10:05:00.000Z	truna	briantumor	so where do you think it is writing to?
2008-01-04T10:05:00.000Z	briantumor	truna	why does it need to do that?
2008-01-04T10:05:00.000Z	briantumor	truna	i'm just trying to install jackd
2008-01-04T10:05:00.000Z	truna	briantumor	i dont know why it has to generate such, i dont know what you are doing
2008-01-04T10:05:00.000Z	truna	briantumor	but do you agree with me that your /boot is 95% full?
2008-01-04T10:06:00.000Z	truna	briantumor	well, and per the error it generates something in same /boot dir  so it will fill er up quick
2008-01-04T10:07:00.000Z	truna	briantumor	perhaps your depmod recognized your image needs upgrade so it generated such?
