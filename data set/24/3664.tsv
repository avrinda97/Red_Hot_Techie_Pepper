2007-11-29T21:39:00.000Z	i-rACEr		hello, i have the folowing problem, after installation i created a second user and selected it to be normal user, not administrator and with this user i can't become root like with the user that was first created
2007-11-29T21:39:00.000Z	ikonia	i-rACEr	add it to the adm group
2007-11-29T21:40:00.000Z	i-rACEr	ikonia	but i don't want that user to be an admin, just to do updates or install software ocasionally
2007-11-29T21:41:00.000Z	ikonia	i-rACEr	whats the difference in becoming root, and being an admin ?
2007-11-29T21:42:00.000Z	i-rACEr	ikonia	i don't want that user to be able to become root, and if i add him to the admin group he can become root
2007-11-29T21:42:00.000Z	ikonia	i-rACEr	ok, create a sudo profile for him
2007-11-29T21:42:00.000Z	i-rACEr	ikonia	i just want to connect to his desktop with vnc and do administrative work
2007-11-29T21:43:00.000Z	ikonia	i-rACEr	that doesn't change what I told you to do
2007-11-29T21:43:00.000Z	i-rACEr	ikonia	a sudo profile?
2007-11-29T21:43:00.000Z	ikonia	i-rACEr	yes, create a sudo list for him so that only $X command can be executed as root
2007-11-29T21:43:00.000Z	ikonia	i-rACEr	investiget the sudoers file
2007-11-29T21:45:00.000Z	i-rACEr	ikonia	i don't want him to execute commands not even with sudo, i just want full control of the system from that user, is this possible?
2007-11-29T21:45:00.000Z	ikonia	i-rACEr	are you messing me around
2007-11-29T21:47:00.000Z	ikonia	i-rACEr	so put your user in the adm group
2007-11-29T21:48:00.000Z	i-rACEr	ikonia	but that that user can also become root, and i don't want that
2007-11-29T21:48:00.000Z	ikonia	i-rACEr	you use your OWN account
2007-11-29T21:48:00.000Z	ikonia	i-rACEr	don't use his account
2007-11-29T21:49:00.000Z	i-rACEr	ikonia	so it's not possible to become root from within an accont that is not in the admin group?
2007-11-29T21:49:00.000Z	ikonia	i-rACEr	I don't think you understand how privileges work
2007-11-29T21:49:00.000Z	ikonia	i-rACEr	create your OWN account on his desktop, and use that
2007-11-29T21:53:00.000Z	ikonia	i-rACEr	you don't - you want to do it with someone elses account
2007-11-29T21:53:00.000Z	ikonia	i-rACEr	put your OWN account in the adm group
2007-11-29T22:00:00.000Z	ikonia	i-rACEr	there is no solution. You need to change your requirments
2007-11-29T22:00:00.000Z	i-rACEr	ikonia	thank you
