2006-08-04T07:53:00.000Z	damnation		hi all, i have a problem, i done a fresh install of dapper and cannot get my wifi to work. it's a WPC54G V3 (im using https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/WirelessCardsSupported as a reference)
2006-08-04T07:53:00.000Z	damnation		and i still can't get my wifi working.
2006-08-04T07:54:00.000Z	damnation		(built in driver works flawlessly with the 2.6.15 kernel, ndiswrapper not needed. Do not know if it will work for install.)
2006-08-04T07:54:00.000Z	Plouj	damnation	who isn't, here?
2006-08-04T07:54:00.000Z	damnation		im using V3

2006-08-04T07:55:00.000Z	damnation		"(built in driver works flawlessly with the 2.6.15 kernel, ndiswrapper not needed. Do not know if it will work for install.)"
2006-08-04T07:56:00.000Z	damnation		do i _have_ to use WEP (or whatever) ubuntu has standard
2006-08-04T07:56:00.000Z	damnation		?
2006-08-04T07:56:00.000Z	damnation		says my session ID is invalid

2006-08-04T07:57:00.000Z	damnation		thanks |thun-afk :)
2006-08-04T07:57:00.000Z	damnation		i just have this problem, i'm used to using WPA, and i'm not at all familiar with WEP or ubuntu
2006-08-04T07:57:00.000Z	damnation		and i'm not 100% my card will even work with ubuntu
2006-08-04T07:58:00.000Z	damnation		cause i use iwconfig and it says i have a broadcome/ airforce1 chipset
2006-08-04T07:58:00.000Z	damnation		yet it's a linksys wpc54g v3
2006-08-04T07:58:00.000Z	Plouj	damnation	wap/wep isn't different to the end user except for security reasons
2006-08-04T07:58:00.000Z	damnation		ok..
2006-08-04T07:59:00.000Z	damnation	AAA	driven?

2006-08-04T07:59:00.000Z	damnation		?
