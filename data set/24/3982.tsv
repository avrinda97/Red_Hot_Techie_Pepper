2007-10-20T21:13:00.000Z	liberum		Since I upgraded to Gutsy, all videos are jerky in VLC. It seems like the larger the video picture, the jerkier it gets
2007-10-20T21:13:00.000Z	PanicByte	liberum	do you have an ATI card???
2007-10-20T21:14:00.000Z	PanicByte	liberum	do you have an ATI card???
2007-10-20T21:21:00.000Z	liberum	PanicByte	Yep :-/&
2007-10-20T21:21:00.000Z	PanicByte	liberum	i disabled the binary only drivers, and it seemed to work ok after that, if that is your case
2007-10-20T21:22:00.000Z	PanicByte	liberum	 i have a feeling it's just a setting screwed up in VLC somewhere
2007-10-20T21:22:00.000Z	liberum	PanicByte	where do i disable the binary only drivers?
2007-10-20T21:23:00.000Z	PanicByte		System > Administration > restricted drivers manager
2007-10-20T21:23:00.000Z	PanicByte	liberum	System > Administration > restricted drivers manager
2007-10-20T21:23:00.000Z	liberum	PanicByte	But it worked fine in feisty... and i kind of like having 3D :)
2007-10-20T21:23:00.000Z	PanicByte	liberum	yeah, it's weird
2007-10-20T21:24:00.000Z	PanicByte	liberum	poke around in the VLC settings
2007-10-20T21:52:00.000Z	PanicByte		did anyone figure out how to solve the VLC shaking problem in gutsy with an ATI graphics card? (besides disabling the binary drivers)
2007-10-20T22:30:00.000Z	PanicByte	liberum	I FOUND THE SOLUTION!!!!!! Stop the VLC Shaking: Open VLC, goto Settings > Preferences > Enable Advanced Options > goto Video > Output Modules > select X11 Video Output
2007-10-20T22:30:00.000Z	liberum	PanicByte	Wow.. you didn't give up? I did :D I will try it out now
2007-10-20T22:36:00.000Z	PanicByte	liberum	well i was having the same problem, i knew it had something to do VLC settings, cause gstreamer settings were good, and other media players were working fine
2007-10-20T22:36:00.000Z	liberum	PanicByte	Well... it sort of worked.. but now the framerate it to slow :) i'm starting to think it's the graphics driver
2007-10-20T22:37:00.000Z	PanicByte	liberum	open terminal and type "gstreamer-properties" and play with those settings
2007-10-20T22:37:00.000Z	PanicByte		because it's working fine for me now
2007-10-20T22:43:00.000Z	liberum	PanicByte	The same.. but Totem does not lag frames... but it DO play all my videos in inverted colors (or something :D)
2007-10-20T22:43:00.000Z	PanicByte	liberum	hey, try OpenGL video output instead of X11 video output
2007-10-20T22:43:00.000Z	PanicByte	liberum	that might be better
2007-10-20T22:44:00.000Z	liberum	PanicByte	Already tried them all :) All are the same, but standard (standard is worse)
2007-10-20T22:50:00.000Z	liberum	PanicByte	I also tried renaming ~/.vlc and completely removing VLC, then install it again
