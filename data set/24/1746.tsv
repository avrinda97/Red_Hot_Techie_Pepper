2009-09-22T05:01:00.000Z	norstrom	RegressLess	Ubuntu sees my gamepad as soon as I plug it in, what is it your try'n to make it do?
2009-09-22T05:02:00.000Z	norstrom		lol
2009-09-22T05:02:00.000Z	RegressLess	norstrom	work. I'm trying to make it work.
2009-09-22T05:02:00.000Z	RegressLess		:P
2009-09-22T05:03:00.000Z	norstrom	RegressLess	ok but work how? what app are you trying to use it with?
2009-09-22T05:04:00.000Z	RegressLess	norstrom	eventually, I'd like to get it working with qjoypad so I can use it in place of my keyboard/mouse for gaming
2009-09-22T05:05:00.000Z	norstrom	RegressLess	when you plug it in and run dmesg do you see something like http://paste.ubuntu.com/275571/
2009-09-22T05:07:00.000Z	RegressLess	norstrom	much more than that, but yes, that is also there
2009-09-22T05:08:00.000Z	norstrom	RegressLess	yeah theres a bunch of stuff before that, but at least we know the system sees the pad
2009-09-22T05:09:00.000Z	RegressLess	norstrom	zsnes lets me set the controls, but only start works, none of the other buttons work
2009-09-22T05:09:00.000Z	RegressLess	norstrom	I probably have something conflicting--I've tried several things thus far
2009-09-22T05:10:00.000Z	norstrom	RegressLess	I'm not familliar with the nes emu's, my pad does work fine with mame though
2009-09-22T05:12:00.000Z	norstrom	RegressLess	have you checked the zsnes forums? theres a whole section on controllers there
2009-09-22T05:15:00.000Z	RegressLess	norstrom	most refer to windows :P
2009-09-22T05:16:00.000Z	RegressLess	norstrom	want to help me make sense of these instructions? http://ubuntu.bryanludvigsen.com/?p=41
2009-09-22T05:20:00.000Z	RegressLess		can someone help me with these instructions: http://ubuntu.bryanludvigsen.com/?p=41 or help me set up a dev with these source files: http://qjoypad.sourceforge.net/#download brb
2009-09-22T05:21:00.000Z	RegressLess		back
2009-09-22T05:22:00.000Z	norstrom	RegressLess	I tried to install/build zsnes but it does not seem to like my 64bit proc
2009-09-22T05:25:00.000Z	RegressLess	norstrom	did you try through add/remove?
2009-09-22T05:26:00.000Z	RegressLess	norstrom	haven't tried 64 bit in a loooong time, but I've got the pc for it
2009-09-22T05:27:00.000Z	norstrom	RegressLess	no actuall, I was try'n to do a build but I'll grab from repos
2009-09-22T05:28:00.000Z	norstrom	RegressLess	BOOO! No 64bit support or option for zsnes
2009-09-22T05:30:00.000Z	RegressLess	norstrom	lame! sorry, I'm in and out as it's time for the kids to go to bed
2009-09-22T05:30:00.000Z	norstrom	RegressLess	no worries
