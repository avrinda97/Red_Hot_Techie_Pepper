2005-04-25T06:22:00.000Z	Xgates		man this is GREAT finally compiling the kernel and getting it to work BUT I found one bug in it:
2005-04-25T06:22:00.000Z	Xgates		 No module symbols loaded - kernel modules not enabled.
2005-04-25T06:22:00.000Z	Xgates		LOL
2005-04-25T06:22:00.000Z	Xgates		I have all the kernel mod options compiled and --> lsmod shows my mods loaded
2005-04-25T06:22:00.000Z	Xgates		hmm oh well
2005-04-25T06:23:00.000Z	liable	Xgates	thats not a bug
2005-04-25T06:23:00.000Z	liable	Xgates	you have modules?
2005-04-25T06:23:00.000Z	Xgates	liable	so what is it then, my modules are loaded
2005-04-25T06:25:00.000Z	Xgates	liable	yes I have mods, and the kernel options are in ther for it
2005-04-25T06:26:00.000Z	Xgates	liable	so if I have the Loadable module support compiled in then why is is saying that in /var/log/messages?
2005-04-25T06:29:00.000Z	liable	Xgates	I have compiled a few kernels and I always get the 'no modules loaded' message, but they always load, and have no probs, maybe an initrd thing or something, I dunno, as long as it works who cares
2005-04-25T06:29:00.000Z	liable	Xgates	its not a bug though
2005-04-25T06:29:00.000Z	Xgates	liable	yea I'm just picky, as a Slacker my box was always squeaky clean :-)
2005-04-25T06:29:00.000Z	Xgates	liable	so why it do that if not a bug
2005-04-25T06:30:00.000Z	Xgates	liable	Slack is great if you know what your doing and I can run it great :-)
2005-04-25T06:31:00.000Z	liable	Xgates	go for debian then
2005-05-24T13:59:00.000Z	liable	Xgates	what about the kernel_image bit
2005-05-24T14:00:00.000Z	liable	Xgates	no, you need kernel_image too
2005-05-24T14:23:00.000Z	liable	Xgates	and the moral of the story is ...
