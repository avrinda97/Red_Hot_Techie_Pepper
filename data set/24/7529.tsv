2004-12-19T10:55:00.000Z	pixelmonkey		My Rhythmbox doesn't play MP3s (complains no plugin)... how do I make this work?
2004-12-19T10:57:00.000Z	pixelmonkey		yea, I was surprised so many people showed up around finals... 30 people came
2004-12-19T10:59:00.000Z	pixelmonkey		wow, I just found a _nasty_ bug with GtkFileChooser widget
2004-12-19T11:00:00.000Z	pixelmonkey		I have this long folder name for an MP3 album, and if I enter the directory that contains it, the GtkFileChooser widget infinite loops resizing the file display area (bigger, smaller, bigger, smaller) and freezes up.
2004-12-19T11:01:00.000Z	crimsun	pixelmonkey	dpkg -l libgtk2.0-0|grep ^ii|awk -F' ' '{print $3}'
2004-12-19T11:01:00.000Z	pixelmonkey	crimsun	2.4.10-1ubuntu
2004-12-19T11:02:00.000Z	pixelmonkey	crimsun	yep
2004-12-19T11:02:00.000Z	pixelmonkey	crimsun	similar issue fixed in newer libgtk?
2004-12-19T11:02:00.000Z	pixelmonkey	crimsun	so bug report exists, you know the #?
2004-12-19T11:02:00.000Z	crimsun	pixelmonkey	seems so, but I'm tracking hoary
2004-12-19T11:03:00.000Z	crimsun	pixelmonkey	not off the top of my head, sorry
2004-12-19T11:03:00.000Z	pixelmonkey	crimsun	no problem, I won't report it then to avoid triage...
2004-12-19T11:03:00.000Z	pixelmonkey	crimsun	I'll try to find the bug report on gnome.org
2004-12-19T11:05:00.000Z	pixelmonkey	crimsun	ah, okay, so it's very possible it was fixed in between if you can't reproduce
2005-02-02T07:44:00.000Z	crimsun	pixelmonkey	dist-upgrade after update
2005-02-02T07:44:00.000Z	pixelmonkey	crimsun	right...
2006-12-30T06:58:00.000Z	crimsun	pixelmonkey	that's correct.
2007-01-26T10:20:00.000Z	crimsun	pixelmonkey	of course.
2007-01-26T10:20:00.000Z	pixelmonkey	crimsun	is it not a separate module?
2007-01-26T10:21:00.000Z	crimsun	pixelmonkey	it is.
2007-01-26T10:21:00.000Z	pixelmonkey	crimsun	I don't see it under /lib/modules/.../
2007-01-26T10:23:00.000Z	crimsun	pixelmonkey	did you clobber it? It most certainly exists.
2007-01-26T10:25:00.000Z	pixelmonkey	crimsun	I must have, I was playing with alsa drivers from source at some point
2007-01-26T10:25:00.000Z	pixelmonkey	crimsun	I'll sort it out, thanks for the sanity check
