2010-07-17T05:33:00.000Z	sebsebseb	bastid_raZor	unless maybe its to talk about other distros a bit :D
2010-07-17T05:36:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	sebsebseb	you've turned your back on the distro that weined you!?!
2010-07-17T05:37:00.000Z	sebsebseb	bastid_raZor	no I started with Fedora Core 2 and 4
2010-07-17T05:37:00.000Z	sebsebseb	bastid_raZor	on an old computer,  where it also took a long time to install.
2010-07-17T05:38:00.000Z	sebsebseb	bastid_raZor	and Ubuntu much faster to install on that computer,  so yeah  I ended up using Ubuntu rather happily for years, and this is going off topic now
2010-07-17T05:39:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	sebsebseb	Lies!
2010-07-17T05:39:00.000Z	sebsebseb	bastid_raZor	What?

2010-07-17T05:40:00.000Z	sebsebseb	bastid_raZor	anyway that guy is in off topic now
