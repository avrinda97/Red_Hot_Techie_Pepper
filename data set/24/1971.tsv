2010-05-19T04:14:00.000Z	deco		why is it that when i turn on my desktop , it's consuming 840MB of ram so i restart and it's only consuming 180MB of ram now.. i restart again and it's consuming 800MB of ram again
2010-05-19T04:14:00.000Z	deco		it's not X , x is only consuming 21MB
2010-05-19T04:14:00.000Z	deco		so no bad video driver
2010-05-19T04:15:00.000Z	edbian	deco	Use the system monitor and determine exactly what is consuming it
2010-05-19T04:15:00.000Z	deco	edbian	i did and it's not telling me
2010-05-19T04:15:00.000Z	deco	edbian	just little processes like 21mb they are not adding up to 800MB
2010-05-19T04:16:00.000Z	edbian	deco	Does it not list enough things?  What's telling you that it is taking 800mb then?
2010-05-19T04:16:00.000Z	deco	edbian	free -m
2010-05-19T04:16:00.000Z	deco	edbian	 and on memory on system mananger
2010-05-19T04:18:00.000Z	edbian	deco	Free shows what is truly free.  Mine says 933 while sys monitor says 344.  The rest is "cached" what the system is keeping around cause it might be useful.  Techincally it is open cause the system will give it up if needed.  It's more complicated than simply "free" and "used" I'm afraid.
2010-05-19T04:19:00.000Z	edbian	deco	The linux stack is very good at handling ram!  Sys monitor shows what is being used by currently running applications.  free shows what is truly not being used by anything (not even the os itself)
2010-05-19T04:19:00.000Z	deco	edbian	this never happens in other distros
2010-05-19T04:20:00.000Z	edbian	deco	I'm using debian and the exact same thing is happening
2010-05-19T04:20:00.000Z	deco	edbian	i mean ram consumption
2010-05-19T04:21:00.000Z	edbian	deco	my system and ubuntu both use "preload" which uses significantly more ram but makes all the apps start faster (in fact it even prioritizes the apps you use the most)
2010-05-19T04:21:00.000Z	edbian	deco	You might wanna try "apt-get remove preload" and see if it helps
2010-05-19T04:22:00.000Z	deco	edbian	i don't have preload
2010-05-19T04:23:00.000Z	edbian	deco	Then I'm not sure what is in all that cached ram space.
2010-05-19T04:23:00.000Z	deco	edbian	hmmm i wonder why it's just in ubuntu , 10.4 in particuler
2010-05-19T04:24:00.000Z	edbian	deco	I am guessing it's the same feature I'm describing but implemented in different software.
2010-05-19T04:24:00.000Z	deco	edbian	actually this has only happened in 10.4
2010-05-19T04:24:00.000Z	deco	edbian	i'm kinda using this PC as a server too so this is really bad :S
2010-05-19T04:25:00.000Z	edbian	deco	I'm researching it
