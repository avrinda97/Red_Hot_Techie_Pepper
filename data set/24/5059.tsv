2006-11-23T15:25:00.000Z	jair		hey guys what is the gnome software I can install to copy, burn, data and audio cds on ubuntu.  I tryied k3b but having some issues with it and the cd-drives
2006-11-23T15:25:00.000Z	jair		thank you all
2006-11-23T15:25:00.000Z	jair		thank you very much
2006-11-23T15:26:00.000Z	DrNick	jair	for data CD's, just use the integrated facilities in nautilus. for audio CD's, use serpentine. or you can install Gnome baker, but its pointless really with the other stuff available IMO as it doesn't give you any more options.
2006-11-23T15:27:00.000Z	jair	DrNick	I will actually being doing DVD, CD, etc so i need a complete tool instead the included with naitilus
2006-11-23T15:27:00.000Z	jair	DrNick	but thank you anyway, i am normally a kde guy
2006-11-23T15:27:00.000Z	DrNick	jair	nautilus does DVD's too
2006-11-23T15:27:00.000Z	jair	DrNick	I will check the options then ;)
2006-11-23T15:28:00.000Z	DrNick	jair	just drag what you want on the DVD into the burner folder, chuck in a blank DVD and record away :)
2006-11-23T15:28:00.000Z	jair	DrNick	yes sounds easy
2006-11-23T15:35:00.000Z	DrNick	jair	chuck the mp3's into a playlist in rhythmbox and hit the burn to CD button. else use serpentine, that accepts mp3
2006-11-23T15:35:00.000Z	jair	DrNick	ohhh interesting then the gnome backer is not as intelligent as k3b
2006-11-23T15:36:00.000Z	DrNick	jair	GNOME baker is rubbish, i dont like it. the usual tools included in nautilus and the auto apps work nicely enough
2006-11-23T15:36:00.000Z	jair	DrNick	so I will have to use it with the other application and burn it
2006-11-23T15:36:00.000Z	jair	DrNick	I will select all teh mp3 files and say "record" ?
2006-11-23T15:36:00.000Z	DrNick	jair	for audo discs, use either rhythmbox, if you use that, or serpentine, as i said
2006-11-23T15:37:00.000Z	jair	DrNick	ohhh I see
2006-11-23T15:37:00.000Z	DrNick	jair	load up serpentine, and its all pretty self-explanitory
2006-11-23T15:38:00.000Z	jair	DrNick	ok
2006-11-23T15:40:00.000Z	jair	DrNick	I think that serpentine is already on the system, now i can not find any icon on ubuntu to start it :(
2006-11-23T15:41:00.000Z	jair	DrNick	nevermind I got it
2006-11-23T15:41:00.000Z	DrNick	jair	under Sound & Video?
2006-11-23T15:42:00.000Z	jair	DrNick	I think that guys don't understand what do I want to accomplish, the freaking serpentine does not support mp3 files :(
2006-11-23T15:43:00.000Z	DrNick	jair	serpentine DOES support mp3 files. heck it'd be pretty much useless otherwise
