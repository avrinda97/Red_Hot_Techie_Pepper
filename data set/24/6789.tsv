2007-02-08T15:48:00.000Z	pavs		just installed xinetd package for telnet but my firewall is refusing connection how do I disable or configure firewall to allow telnet connection?
2007-02-08T15:50:00.000Z	Jowi	pavs	no ports are blocked by default
2007-02-08T15:53:00.000Z	Jowi	pavs	so start it. "sudo /etc/init.d/nameoftelnetserver start". but I would recommend using ssh instead of telnet.
2007-02-08T16:00:00.000Z	Jowi	pavs	"ssh user@ipaddress"
2007-02-08T16:02:00.000Z	Jowi	pavs	how are these computers connected?
2007-02-08T16:04:00.000Z	Jowi	pavs	do you have a firewall active on the server computer?
2007-02-08T16:04:00.000Z	Jowi	pavs	if you know you set it up yourself.
2007-02-08T16:04:00.000Z	Jowi	pavs	ubuntu does not block incoming connections by default
2007-02-08T16:05:00.000Z	Jowi	pavs	"sudo /etc/init.d/ssh restart"
2007-02-08T16:05:00.000Z	Jowi	pavs	see if you gete any errors
2007-02-08T16:06:00.000Z	Jowi	pavs	you did a scan on your public or private ip address?
2007-02-08T16:07:00.000Z	Jowi	pavs	are you using the same computer to connect with as the server is running on?
2007-02-08T16:09:00.000Z	Jowi	pavs	ok, sit on the server machine and try "ssh ipaddressofserver" does that work?
2007-02-08T16:11:00.000Z	Jowi	pavs	and "ssh 127.0.0.1"?
2007-02-08T16:12:00.000Z	Jowi	pavs	"yes" to that
2007-02-08T16:12:00.000Z	Jowi	pavs	so the ssh server is running fine...
2007-02-08T16:13:00.000Z	Jowi	pavs	127.0.0.1 won't work from the laptop
2007-02-08T16:13:00.000Z	Jowi	pavs	you probably set up a firewall or edited /etc/hosts.deny on the server computer.
2007-02-16T15:22:00.000Z	Jowi	pavs	that is not recommended. when you set up a domain name against an ipaddress it will take a few days for it to be updated
2007-02-16T15:23:00.000Z	Jowi	pavs	if you have a resonably stable "dynamic" ip (for example it only change one per six months) it's no problem.
2007-02-16T15:24:00.000Z	Jowi	pavs	what do you mean you did it in Windows?
2007-02-16T15:26:00.000Z	Jowi	pavs	you don't set the A record in the operating system. if you purchased a domain name you set it up with a dns tool where you bought it.
2007-02-16T15:28:00.000Z	Jowi	pavs	you should go to the site from were you registered the domain and set it up from there.
2007-02-16T15:30:00.000Z	Jowi	pavs	that's nice from them. free of charge for 5 domains. not bad
