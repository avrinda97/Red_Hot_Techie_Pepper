2011-09-06T23:54:00.000Z	oCean	user	run apt-cache policy libiso9660-7
2011-09-06T23:52:00.000Z	oCean	user	did you run sudo apt-get update
2011-09-06T23:52:00.000Z	oCean	user	because the package you mention is actuall a build1:  libiso9660-7_0.81-4build1_i386.deb
2011-09-06T23:52:00.000Z	oCean	user	sudo apt-get update does not install, it updates the repo metadata
2011-09-06T23:54:00.000Z	oCean	user	run the apt-cache policy command
2011-09-06T23:54:00.000Z	oCean	user	apt-cache policy libiso9660-7
2011-09-06T23:55:00.000Z	oCean	user	then see what is Candidate
2011-09-06T23:55:00.000Z	oCean	user	and that^ is weird, since it should read Candidate: 0.81-4build1
2011-09-06T23:56:00.000Z	oCean	user	please paste the output for sudo apt-get update in a pastebin
2011-09-06T23:57:00.000Z	oCean	user	go to http://paste.ubuntu.com and paste the output please
2011-09-07T00:01:00.000Z	oCean	user	weird, you 'hit' the universe repo fine. The output of apt-cache policy is still the same as before?
2011-09-07T00:02:00.000Z	oCean	user	The output of apt-cache policy is still the same as before?
2011-09-07T00:02:00.000Z	oCean	user	The output of apt-cache policy is still the same as before?
2011-09-07T00:04:00.000Z	oCean	user	ok, I have NO idea why it does not get updated.
2011-09-07T00:05:00.000Z	oCean	user	well, you could try to remove the PPA's from your sources, since those are never officially supported.
