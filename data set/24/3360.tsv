2008-02-13T04:06:00.000Z	xeom		Im running into a lot of keyboard lag is there anyway to reduce this? as i type something it sometimes takes a while to acctualy show up on the screen for instance i can finish typing a whole word and then it will pop up.
2008-02-13T04:06:00.000Z	xeom		i acctualy have to turn off repeat keys because its so bad
2008-02-13T04:06:00.000Z	xavieran	xeom	What are your hardware statistics?

2008-02-13T04:07:00.000Z	xavieran		I would say your swap is not mounted...
2008-02-13T04:08:00.000Z	xeom		Jack_sparrow:wired
2008-02-13T04:08:00.000Z	xavieran	xeom	can you please run the command "mount"?

2008-02-13T04:13:00.000Z	xavieran		xeom:Just as I thought...your swap partition is not mounted...just to be sure ,however,could you also paste the output of the command "cat /etc/fstab"?
2008-02-13T04:14:00.000Z	xeom		yea i acctualy didnt make a swap partion wasn't sure i needed it. One sec for that other part
2008-02-13T04:15:00.000Z	xeom	xavieran	http://pastebin.com/d62103dde
2008-02-13T04:15:00.000Z	xavieran		xeom:You definetely need it!
2008-02-13T04:16:00.000Z	xeom		Xavieran: ok what would be quickest way to edit the partion and make one? as well how big should it be?
2008-02-13T04:17:00.000Z	xavieran	xeom	You will need to boot into the livecd and create a swap partition...with the amount of ram you have I would say 2gb would suffice...
2008-02-13T04:18:00.000Z	xeom	xavieran	i thought i wouldnt need any with 2gb of ram will do now thanks for the help
