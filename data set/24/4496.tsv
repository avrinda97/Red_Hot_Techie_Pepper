2007-03-29T12:27:00.000Z	harpette	JP79	so, at the new location, you have a dhcp router too? or the same?
2007-03-29T12:28:00.000Z	JP79	harpette	i have the same set up
2007-03-29T12:28:00.000Z	harpette	JP79	same tel line, different room?
2007-03-29T12:28:00.000Z	JP79	harpette	different telephone line.  completely different house... different ip address
2007-03-29T12:29:00.000Z	harpette	JP79	you have a dsl modem which you plug the computer in?
2007-03-29T12:29:00.000Z	JP79	harpette	yeah, its a different modem.....
2007-03-29T12:30:00.000Z	harpette	JP79	do you get a dhcp connection at all?
2007-03-29T12:30:00.000Z	JP79	harpette	1st place... modem to router to computer. 2nd place, modem to router (acting as a switch) to computer
2007-03-29T12:31:00.000Z	JP79	harpette	what do you mean... in the computer?  i went to network under the system menu and it is set to dhcp
2007-03-29T12:32:00.000Z	harpette	JP79	it sounds to me like your new dsl modem + new router setup is not working. Plug in the comp directly into the modem just to check
2007-03-29T12:34:00.000Z	JP79	harpette	well i have two computers in this new house.  both computers are behind the same router.  this one (the one running mirc) currently has a connection.  OS is windows.  the 2nd computer isnt working. OS is ubuntu 6.06
2007-03-29T12:34:00.000Z	JP79	harpette	so i think it's localized to the computer running ubuntu
2007-03-29T12:35:00.000Z	JP79	harpette	i just dont know how to tell it to find the connection
2007-03-29T12:35:00.000Z	harpette	JP79	ok. but you say the Ubuntu comp used to work at the previous location?
2007-03-29T12:35:00.000Z	JP79	harpette	yes, thats correct.  it used to work at the other location
2007-03-29T12:38:00.000Z	JP79	harpette	hehe im temped to reinstall the os, since i installed it just before i moved the computer....
2007-03-29T12:38:00.000Z	JP79	harpette	.... but it should be an easy fix
2007-03-29T12:38:00.000Z	harpette	JP79	try "sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart"
2007-03-29T12:42:00.000Z	JP79	harpette	damn, it didnt work
2007-03-29T12:43:00.000Z	harpette	JP79	what did it say?
2007-03-29T12:43:00.000Z	harpette	JP79	BTW, is that wireless, or plugged in?
2007-03-29T12:47:00.000Z	harpette	JP79	OK i gotta go. Good luck. Have a look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/WirelessTroubleShootingGuide
2007-03-29T12:51:00.000Z	JP79	harpette	ya know what? let me make sure it's not the ethernet cable
