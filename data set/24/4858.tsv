2009-01-17T03:20:00.000Z	user___	jedi06	pastebin the output of "mount" and we can help you further
2009-01-17T03:23:00.000Z	user___	jedi06	are you running from livecd?
2009-01-17T03:25:00.000Z	user___	jedi06	ok, i think a ss is helpful
2009-01-17T03:27:00.000Z	user___	jedi06	which foremost command doesnt work for you?
2009-01-17T03:29:00.000Z	user___	jedi06	you mentioned you were running a command with included addressing a hard disk, what command was this?
2009-01-17T03:31:00.000Z	user___	jedi06	which exact command doesnt work? :-)
2009-01-17T03:34:00.000Z	user___	jedi06	are the files to be recovered in the virtual machine you are running also the live-cd? or are they on the host == windows with vbox program?
2009-01-17T03:35:00.000Z	user___	jedi06	(theres a scroll up and down line in the chat program)
2009-01-17T03:35:00.000Z	user___	jedi06	does the live cd recognize the hd? f.e. does nautilus offer the disk to mount?
2009-01-17T03:37:00.000Z	user___	jedi06	ok, one moment
2009-01-17T03:39:00.000Z	user___	jedi06	so it would be sda (which i dont understand, because you said that it didnt work)
2009-01-17T03:39:00.000Z	user___	jedi06	depends on how the foremost command works
2009-01-17T03:39:00.000Z	user___	jedi06	step one is creating the usb..
2009-01-17T03:40:00.000Z	user___	jedi06	i suggest creating a network file system location which you can mount instead of a usb location
2009-01-17T03:41:00.000Z	user___	jedi06	"shared folder on the host" is not a real network file system i think, which means other could still work very well
2009-01-17T03:42:00.000Z	user___	jedi06	btw did you say that sda worked for you?
2009-01-17T03:43:00.000Z	user___	jedi06	alright, one moment
2009-01-17T03:45:00.000Z	user___	jedi06	hmm, the question is, how can i setup network shares, which you could repost to the channel when things have calmed down a bit, they will give you a keyword (factoid) which i dont remember at this moment
2009-01-17T03:47:00.000Z	user___	jedi06	dont know sorry, no relevant experience by myself..
2009-01-21T01:42:00.000Z	user___	jedi06	just an idea: the wikipedia page of minitab provides alternative programs at the end of the page
