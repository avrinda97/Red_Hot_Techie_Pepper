2008-04-08T05:48:00.000Z	x0x	LjL	ok
2008-04-08T06:32:00.000Z	LjL	x0x	there can be. why do you need to use it? sudo can do everything that root can
2008-04-08T06:32:00.000Z	x0x	LjL	ok thanks...
2008-04-09T19:42:00.000Z	x0x	LjL	can you help me dns?
2008-04-09T19:43:00.000Z	LjL	x0x	can you repeat your question?
2008-04-09T19:45:00.000Z	LjL	x0x	"set DNS", as in, select the DNS servers you want to use?
2008-04-09T19:47:00.000Z	x0x	LjL	ie ns1.mydomain.com i want to set as domain name server. and also add it to my box how do i do it?
2008-04-09T19:48:00.000Z	LjL	x0x	well, the proper way to do it would be to set it in the GNOME preferences for network. but, i don't use GNOME, and i've also encountered problems with network-manager and resolvconf, so i've removed both, and i set my DNS directly in /etc/resolv.conf (note that if you're using DHCP, that too will change your DNS servers automatically)
2008-04-09T19:48:00.000Z	LjL	x0x	but i can't really say that's the recommended way to set DNS :)
2008-04-09T19:50:00.000Z	x0x	LjL	i didnt mean name server. i mean domain name server.
2008-04-09T19:50:00.000Z	LjL	x0x	i think i don't know the difference between the two
2008-04-09T19:52:00.000Z	x0x	LjL	nameserver for resolve ip from hostname. dns domain name server. resolve ip from domain. or something i cant explain what is dns
2008-04-09T19:53:00.000Z	LjL	x0x	no, in fact i don't get you :) i thought a Domain Name Server resolved "stuff" into IP addresses generally speaking.
