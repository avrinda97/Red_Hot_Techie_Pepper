2007-01-12T17:46:00.000Z	PirateHead		Ubuntu frequently "drops" my USB mouse on my Ubuntu Edgy laptop. I boot up and it's fine, it's recognized and it works, then reliably within 20 minutes my mouse stops working. My laptop's track-pad still works, but my USB mouse does not. Unplugging it and plugging it back in never works; rebooting the comptuer always restores the mouse. Can anyone help me?

2007-01-12T17:47:00.000Z	PirateHead		alright, it sounds like it's a specific hardware problem for us
2007-01-12T17:47:00.000Z	PirateHead		has anything worked for you?
2007-01-12T17:48:00.000Z	andycr		haven't tried much. the darn thing hits random keys when you move it, so its been in for repair
2007-01-12T17:48:00.000Z	andycr		(already came back once unrepaired)
2007-01-12T17:48:00.000Z	PirateHead		Yikes. Luckily, that hasn't happened to mine.
2007-01-12T17:48:00.000Z	andycr		yeah
2007-01-12T17:48:00.000Z	andycr		where did you buy yours?
2007-01-12T17:48:00.000Z	PirateHead		Circuit City
2007-01-12T17:49:00.000Z	andycr		good. don't buy one from best buy. 5 repairs so far, 100% have failed
2007-01-12T17:49:00.000Z	andycr		4-5

2007-01-12T17:49:00.000Z	PirateHead	andycr	I know, best buy is no good fo rme.
2007-01-12T17:49:00.000Z	andycr		yeah

2007-01-12T17:49:00.000Z	PirateHead	andycr	I'm more knowledgable than their "techs", so they can't help me.
