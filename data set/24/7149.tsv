2005-04-13T15:01:00.000Z	adamh	fsapo	Did you install ATI's drivers manually?

2005-04-13T15:02:00.000Z	adamh	fsapo	Yeah, reinstall. You've learned your lesson: don't mess with dpkg :)
2005-04-13T15:02:00.000Z	adamh	fsapo	The preview release should work great :)
2005-04-13T15:03:00.000Z	adamh	fsapo	One of the things I've appreciated most about my setup is that I had the foresight to put /opt in a separate partition :)
2005-04-13T15:03:00.000Z	adamh	fsapo	/opt/ut2k4 :)
2005-04-13T15:03:00.000Z	adamh	fsapo	/opt/eclipse, /opt/doom3, etc :)

2005-04-13T15:06:00.000Z	adamh	fsapo	I don't know -- but if not, it'll be very simple to switch. Check the BinaryDriverHowto on the wiki
2005-04-13T15:06:00.000Z	adamh	fsapo	You won't have to install anything from ATI
