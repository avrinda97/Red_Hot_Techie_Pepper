2009-12-11T07:23:00.000Z	mizery		My installation of xubuntu is using a built-in configuration for Xorg.  How can I configure/create a hardware-specific configuration to use instead?
2009-12-11T07:23:00.000Z	dtownhero	mizery	check /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2009-12-11T07:24:00.000Z	mizery	dtownhero	It doesn't exist
2009-12-11T07:24:00.000Z	dtownhero	mizery	you can create your own but you will need to know the important info like driver version you have installed - etc...
2009-12-11T07:25:00.000Z	mizery	dtownhero	I can handle that.  Will I have to write one frm scratch or is there a tool/app I can use to generate one?
2009-12-11T07:25:00.000Z	dtownhero	mizery	if you have an nvidia or ati card the drivers should auto-gen one for you, what card are you using?
2009-12-11T07:27:00.000Z	mizery	dtownhero	00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation 82845G/GL[Brookdale-G]/GE Chipset Integrated Graphics Device (rev 01)
2009-12-11T07:27:00.000Z	dtownhero	mizery	I don't believe you can customize very much of that card
2009-12-11T07:28:00.000Z	mizery	dtownhero	I just want to provide a functional/stable system for a friend.  Right now it isn't stable
2009-12-11T07:28:00.000Z	dtownhero	mizery	it will function but I doubt you'll be able to run anything more than flash games on it
2009-12-11T07:28:00.000Z	dtownhero	mizery	what is the problem with the default config it has?
2009-12-11T07:54:00.000Z	mizery	dtownhero	Problem is: Xorg/xfce/desktop environment freezes after some time of usage.  I am able to log into the system remotely, however.  So it is a desktop issue.
2009-12-11T07:54:00.000Z	mizery	dtownhero	I am providing a configuration and I believe it will solve the issue
2009-12-11T07:55:00.000Z	dtownhero	mizery	ahh, you're sure it's not overheating?
2009-12-11T07:55:00.000Z	dtownhero	mizery	I have a lappy that dies on XFCE when overheating
2009-12-11T07:59:00.000Z	mizery	dtownhero	I'm sure it's not overheating.  It's  desktop
2009-12-11T07:59:00.000Z	dtownhero	mizery	ahh
2009-12-11T07:59:00.000Z	dtownhero	mizery	well there are no drivers for that card
2009-12-11T08:00:00.000Z	dtownhero	mizery	if xfce is freezing the system there is something else wrong with it
2009-12-11T08:00:00.000Z	dtownhero	mizery	have you checked power supply and that the chip is secure in the board?
2009-12-11T08:01:00.000Z	mizery	dtownhero	I am logged into the system via ssh.  I'm positive it is an issue with the vga chipset/driver.
2009-12-11T08:01:00.000Z	dtownhero	mizery	doesn't crazy via ssh?
2009-12-11T08:01:00.000Z	mizery	dtownhero	nope, I am able to use the system normally via ssh
2009-12-11T08:01:00.000Z	dtownhero	mizery	yeah man you're on it, put a pci card in that hizzy
