2007-06-05T16:51:00.000Z	PreZLaptop		Another 8 months until my next uptime milestone
2007-06-05T16:52:00.000Z	PreZLaptop		BTW - where should I request a patch be included in the kernel (it is available in the wild)
2007-06-05T16:53:00.000Z	PreZLaptop		ooh! my next uptime milestone is the highest milestone in the uptimed default config :)
2007-06-05T16:54:00.000Z	ikonia	PreZLaptop	we don't care about uptime showing off, its for people who don't maintain their boxes
2007-06-05T16:56:00.000Z	PreZLaptop	ikonia	don't maintain their boxes? are you suggesting that its impossible to have a long uptime on a properly maintained box?
2007-06-05T16:56:00.000Z	ikonia	PreZLaptop	I don't want to discuss it
2007-06-05T16:57:00.000Z	ikonia	PreZLaptop	this is a support channel so its not appropriate
2007-06-05T16:58:00.000Z	PreZLaptop	ikonia	do I lose my support if my machine has been up over a certain amount of time? because its 'poorly maintained'? ;)
2007-06-05T16:58:00.000Z	ikonia	PreZLaptop	I've just explained why I don't feel it appropriate to discuss it
2007-06-05T16:58:00.000Z	PreZLaptop	ikonia	I'm needling you man.
2007-06-05T05:00:00.000Z	PreZLaptop	ikonia	however you *DID* ignore my REAL question - ie. who to talk to/email/etc. about a kernel patch being put into the ubuntu kernel build.
2007-06-05T05:01:00.000Z	ikonia	PreZLaptop	what sort of patch ?
2007-06-05T05:01:00.000Z	ikonia	PreZLaptop	I missed the question on a patch
2007-06-05T05:01:00.000Z	PreZLaptop	ikonia	a patch that will enable the sierra wireless cards (common in laptops with 3G networking support, common on the better Lenovos) on driver load.
2007-06-05T05:02:00.000Z	ikonia	PreZLaptop	have you written the patch ?
2007-06-05T05:02:00.000Z	PreZLaptop	ikonia	no, I found it online
2007-06-05T05:02:00.000Z	ikonia	PreZLaptop	if you feed it in to the upstream kernel it will get included eventually once its classed as stable
2007-06-05T05:02:00.000Z	PreZLaptop	ikonia	someone already put them upstream into the kernel, which is why its on the LKML
2007-06-05T05:03:00.000Z	ikonia	PreZLaptop	sit tight then, its on it way
2007-06-05T05:03:00.000Z	PreZLaptop	ikonia	that doesn't help me now, which is why I was asking if it could be included in the patches unbuntu applies to vanilla kernels
2007-06-05T05:03:00.000Z	ikonia	PreZLaptop	I doubt ubuntu will accept that sort of patch
2007-06-05T05:04:00.000Z	ikonia	PreZLaptop	however you could package it yourself for your own personal use, you seem pretty aware of how eveything works
2007-06-05T05:04:00.000Z	ikonia	PreZLaptop	there is a guide on the ubuntu forums
2007-06-05T05:04:00.000Z	PreZLaptop	ikonia	the part about restricted modules was terse at best, just plain wrong at worst.
