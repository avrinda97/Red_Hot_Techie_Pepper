2011-05-13T21:10:00.000Z	sudipta		how to look up a word meaning using curl?
2011-05-13T21:11:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	sudipta	curl is to download url's, not to lookup words
2012-01-12T23:19:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	sudipta	 does it show in mount?
2012-01-12T23:19:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	sudipta	 I rephrase that: in a terminal, type mount, do you see the partition
2012-01-12T23:33:00.000Z	sudipta	MonkeyDust	:i have pasted the output on pastebin
2012-01-12T23:33:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	sudipta	 then paste the url here

2012-01-12T23:34:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	sudipta	 what was your initial question again?
2012-01-12T23:35:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	sudipta	 what's the output from df -h? pastebinit it again
2012-01-12T23:35:00.000Z	sudipta	MonkeyDust	:i have the partition earlier but now, after installing kubuntu 11.10 it's just gone

2012-01-12T23:37:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	sudipta	 idd, only one partition, that's odd, what's the output from sudo fdisk -l (don't forget sudo)

2012-01-12T23:40:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	sudipta	 great, we're getting somewhere, you see the partition, you just have to mount them, either manually or in /etc/fstab
2012-01-12T23:41:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	sudipta	 in a terminal: mkdir blah and then sudo mount /dev/sda5 blah
2012-01-12T23:43:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	sudipta	 first do it manually, so you see what happens: mkdir NTFS and then sudo mount /dev/sda5 NTFS
2012-01-12T23:46:00.000Z	sudipta	MonkeyDust	it works fine......except one thing that i can not move anything to trash
2012-01-12T23:47:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	sudipta	 \o/ glad you're helped
2012-01-12T23:47:00.000Z	sudipta	MonkeyDust	thanks a lot :)
2012-01-13T00:26:00.000Z	sudipta	MonkeyDust	hey thanks for helping me out,I have made changes to the fstab and everything works fine..except for one thing. Anything I want to delete has to be deleted permanently, i.e. I can not able to move it to 'trash' .No biggy but a little itch
2012-01-13T00:29:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	sudipta	 it's in dconf-editor => org - gnome - nautilus - preferences
2012-01-13T00:33:00.000Z	sudipta	MonkeyDust	where exactly?
2012-01-13T00:34:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	sudipta	 i guess you need to install dconf, when it's done, open it and go to org - gnome - nautilus - preferences
2012-01-13T00:36:00.000Z	sudipta	MonkeyDust	i have dconf installed.....but could not find any option regarding this tiny problem,i want files to be moved to tha 'trash' where I use "move to trash" option
