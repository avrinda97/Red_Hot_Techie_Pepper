2009-11-25T10:39:00.000Z	thevor		Hi. I am having trouble connecting to an external hard drive that is connected to a wireless router. My room mates have no problem connecting to it, and I can see it in "places->Network", but when I double click, I can't see any of the files that are stored on it, or write to it at all. But the thing is, when I plug the external hard drive into my machine via usb, I can read and write without any problems. I am using ubuntu 9.10, and i
2009-11-25T10:39:00.000Z	thevor		t is a nexstar GX external hard drive. Anyone have any ideas?
2009-11-25T10:40:00.000Z	linucks	thevor	can you connect to the drive with smb://hostname or smb://ipaddress in your file manager? (assuming you are using gnome)
2009-11-25T10:41:00.000Z	thevor	linucks	When I connect in places->network, the file name is smb://base-station-1.local/   (base-station-1 is the name of the device), but I'm not sure how to determine the ip address.
2009-11-25T10:42:00.000Z	linucks	thevor	to find out the ip address open a terminal and type 'nnblookup base-station-1'
2009-11-25T10:43:00.000Z	thevor	linucks	nnblookup isn't a command for me.
2009-11-25T10:43:00.000Z	thevor		nmblookup worked.
2009-11-25T10:44:00.000Z	linucks	thevor	yeah sorry it's nmblookup, I typed that wrong.
2009-11-25T10:44:00.000Z	thevor		Ok cool.
2009-11-25T10:44:00.000Z	linucks		did you get the IP?
2009-11-25T10:44:00.000Z	thevor		Gave me two different ips.
2009-11-25T10:45:00.000Z	linucks	thevor	try smb://ip in your file manager first, with both of the ips, se we can determine if lookuping up the netbios name is the problem or not
2009-11-25T10:45:00.000Z	linucks		so*
2009-11-25T10:46:00.000Z	thevor		Ihmm..where is file manager
2009-11-25T10:47:00.000Z	linucks	thevor	open your home folder
2009-11-25T10:47:00.000Z	thevor		Both ips took me nowhere.
2009-11-25T10:47:00.000Z	thevor		0 files
2009-11-25T10:47:00.000Z	thevor		(items)
2009-11-25T10:48:00.000Z	linucks	thevor	are you on the same workgroup as the windows share?
2009-11-25T10:48:00.000Z	thevor		I'm not sure. I think it is a mac share though. I moved in here, both the current residents have macs, and their dad set up the network, and it is a mac router.
2009-11-25T10:49:00.000Z	thevor		Is there an easy way to determine what workgroup I am on?
2009-11-25T10:49:00.000Z	linucks	thevor	yes /etc/samba/smb.conf lookfor 'workgroup = ...'
2009-11-25T10:50:00.000Z	linucks	thevor	the first step would be to determine if you can mount the share with smbmount however, to see if it gives you a more verbose error.
2009-11-25T10:50:00.000Z	linucks	thevor	sorry but I have to go afk for some dinner, will be back after.. but I am sure there is someone else that can assist you.
