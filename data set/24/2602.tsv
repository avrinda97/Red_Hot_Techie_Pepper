2008-10-31T02:22:00.000Z	jrib	Simon1245	best to just ask the channel your question.  If someone knows the answer, they will try to answer you
2008-10-31T02:28:00.000Z	jrib	Simon1245	is /dev/sda6 your /?
2008-10-31T02:34:00.000Z	jrib	Simon1245	you never answered my question
2008-10-31T02:35:00.000Z	jrib	Simon1245	is sda6 your /?
2008-10-31T02:37:00.000Z	jrib	Simon1245	well at this point, I think it would be prudent for you to backup your files first.  Use a livecd.  Or do you already have backups?
2008-10-31T02:38:00.000Z	jrib	Simon1245	use a live cd
2010-02-13T18:34:00.000Z	jrib	Simon1245	help.ubuntu.com
2010-02-13T18:34:00.000Z	Simon1245	jrib	Thanks Will check it
2010-02-13T18:38:00.000Z	Simon1245	jrib	I think this will do in the beginning. Anyways, You know a ebook I could continue with once I readed this so I can learn more?
2010-02-13T18:39:00.000Z	jrib	Simon1245	theer's not much more you need unless you want to start getting into more advanced stuff
2010-02-13T18:39:00.000Z	Simon1245	jrib	Does help.ubuntu.com cover the terminal part aswell?
2010-02-14T20:12:00.000Z	jrib	Simon1245	cd -
2010-02-14T20:12:00.000Z	Simon1245	jrib	Is there any other command?
2010-02-14T20:12:00.000Z	jrib	Simon1245	what do you want to accomplish?
2010-02-14T20:13:00.000Z	Simon1245	jrib	I think there was something like cd..
2010-02-14T20:13:00.000Z	jrib	Simon1245	cd ..   goes to the parent directory, which happens to be the same in the scenario you proposed, but it's not what you asked
2010-02-14T20:13:00.000Z	Simon1245	jrib	Oh ok, Thank you :)
2010-02-15T18:20:00.000Z	jrib	Simon1245	no, it's not a money tree...
2010-02-15T18:21:00.000Z	Simon1245	jrib	Lol :D
2010-02-15T18:21:00.000Z	jrib	Simon1245	you need mkmoney for that
2010-02-15T18:21:00.000Z	Simon1245	jrib	I usually never pay for anything I use over internet :D
2010-02-15T18:21:00.000Z	jrib	Simon1245	"usually" huh
2010-02-15T18:22:00.000Z	Simon1245	jrib	I mean always :D
