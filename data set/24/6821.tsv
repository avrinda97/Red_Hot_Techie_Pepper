2005-08-10T07:20:00.000Z	_SWAT_		I need a text editor (php/html etc.) which I can mod with great detail. I want it minimalistic (buttons etc.) and want to set all colors. Any suggestions?
2005-08-10T07:21:00.000Z	Xenguy	_SWAT_	vim?
2005-08-10T07:21:00.000Z	_SWAT_	Xenguy	thnx though :D
2005-08-10T07:21:00.000Z	Xenguy	_SWAT_	gvim?
2005-08-10T07:23:00.000Z	_SWAT_	Xenguy	never heard of gvim. Will look into it. thnx for the heads up :)
2005-08-10T07:24:00.000Z	Xenguy	_SWAT_	remember, learning (g)vi(m) is an investment :-)
2005-08-10T07:25:00.000Z	_SWAT_	Xenguy	I used vim as terminal editor so, at least I know that for a little bit
2005-08-10T07:26:00.000Z	Xenguy	_SWAT_	perfect, just learn all the commands :)
2005-08-10T07:28:00.000Z	_SWAT_	Xenguy	damn... that's would be a lot of learning. Do you know of any other good editors?
2005-08-10T07:29:00.000Z	Xenguy	_SWAT_	seriously, there are 'refcards' on the web that give you all the commands -- give it 3 months, and you'll be starting to cruise
2005-08-10T07:30:00.000Z	Xenguy	_SWAT_	otherwise something like glimmer, or gedit, or emacs =), etc.
2005-08-10T07:30:00.000Z	_SWAT_	Xenguy	why should I 'spend' 3 months learning vim? There are other editors on the web which don't need 3 months of learning
2005-08-10T07:30:00.000Z	Xenguy	_SWAT_	because of the dividends if you do stick it out
2005-08-10T07:32:00.000Z	_SWAT_	Xenguy	goldfish, i'm comparing vim now to things like gedit. Aren't those much faster/effective?
2005-08-10T07:34:00.000Z	Xenguy	_SWAT_	with vim you have to 'dive deep' and practice -- but after you do, it like this mythical, invincible editing tool that just chews up text files :-)
2005-08-10T07:34:00.000Z	_SWAT_	Xenguy	you make it sound really tastefull. Damn. You really start to convince me
2005-08-10T07:34:00.000Z	Xenguy	_SWAT_	but yeah, gedit will get you productive in the short run
2005-08-10T07:35:00.000Z	_SWAT_	Xenguy	longrun vim is better?
2005-08-10T07:35:00.000Z	Xenguy	_SWAT_	its like climbing a big hill :-)
2005-08-10T07:35:00.000Z	Xenguy	_SWAT_	"longrun" is vim's middle name ;-)
2005-08-10T07:35:00.000Z	_SWAT_	Xenguy	I like climbing hills. I'm also now using Linux no matter the difficulty/cost. I take a crap on it :-)
2005-08-10T07:35:00.000Z	Xenguy	_SWAT_	yeah, there's a lot to explore
2005-08-10T07:37:00.000Z	_SWAT_	Xenguy	and while I'm learning myself, I'm trying to convince others too :D
2005-08-10T07:38:00.000Z	Xenguy	_SWAT_	doing it yourself is the best proof that it works (and it's fun too, some of the time =)
