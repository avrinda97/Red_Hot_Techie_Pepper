2009-11-13T07:18:00.000Z	knoppies	Billiard	gbear14275, could you use wine to open it?
2009-11-13T08:16:00.000Z	Billiard	knoppies	i think the guest additions is for the host os correct?
2009-11-13T08:17:00.000Z	Billiard	knoppies	the package that is
2009-11-13T08:17:00.000Z	knoppies	Billiard	I think it is for the guest OS, I remember having trouble using the .iso so I used the ones in synaptic, and it worked. But I was using a Gnome ubuntu as my Guest OS.
2009-11-13T08:18:00.000Z	Billiard	knoppies	its for the host, it says in the description
2009-11-13T08:18:00.000Z	knoppies	Billiard	ah, then my memory is worse than I thought.
2009-11-13T08:18:00.000Z	knoppies	Billiard	sorry, I did this a long time ago. its all hazy
2009-11-13T08:19:00.000Z	Billiard	knoppies	 provides an iso image ... guest additions  for Linux ... to be installed on the host system.
2009-11-13T08:19:00.000Z	Billiard	knoppies	i wasnt sure either i had to look
2009-11-13T08:19:00.000Z	knoppies	Billiard	ok. then I must have used the .iso and got it working.
2009-11-13T08:20:00.000Z	Billiard	knoppies	yeah if you found where the package put the iso, that probably would work too
2009-11-13T08:21:00.000Z	knoppies	Billiard	even if I installed the package on the Guest OS. maybe.
2009-11-23T14:18:00.000Z	Billiard	knoppies	it works, but ok
2009-11-23T14:11:00.000Z	Billiard	knoppies	dont put the * in quotes
2009-11-23T14:12:00.000Z	knoppies	Billiard	mattcen ok, but that still doesnt solve my problem. Is there a way to filter the ls output?
2009-11-23T14:12:00.000Z	Billiard	knoppies	what do you want filtered?
2009-11-23T14:13:00.000Z	Billiard	knoppies	ls *.txt   ?
2009-11-23T14:13:00.000Z	knoppies	Billiard	but that will try search the directory named *.txt
2009-11-23T14:14:00.000Z	Billiard	knoppies	specify the directory as well
2009-11-23T14:14:00.000Z	knoppies	Billiard	so ./*.txt
2009-11-23T14:15:00.000Z	Billiard	knoppies	i would think it would work either way, but its going to look for directries first i think
2009-11-23T14:16:00.000Z	Billiard	knoppies	try the -d option
2009-11-23T14:16:00.000Z	knoppies	Billiard	ok.
2009-11-23T14:20:00.000Z	Billiard	knoppies	np
