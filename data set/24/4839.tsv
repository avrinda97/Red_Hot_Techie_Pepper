2007-03-14T14:16:00.000Z	xtknight	sethk	are you talking about duration of memtest?
2007-03-14T14:16:00.000Z	sethk	xtknight	yes
2007-03-14T14:17:00.000Z	sethk	xtknight	I've seen it take close to four hours for a single test cycle
2007-03-14T14:17:00.000Z	xtknight	sethk	 my memtest for 2G completed in 2 hrs.
2007-03-14T14:17:00.000Z	xtknight	sethk	i dont know though, it may have been a different test.  i dont think i ran anything advanced, just the normal regiment
2007-03-14T14:18:00.000Z	sethk	xtknight	ok, 2 hours is much better.  but it is still not something you want to be waiting around for.
2007-03-14T14:18:00.000Z	sethk	xtknight	that's very good.  My testing was on some embedded systems using older processors.
2007-03-17T16:55:00.000Z	sethk	xtknight	I have servers running happily on dapper and I have absolutely no need to touch them
2007-03-17T16:56:00.000Z	xtknight	sethk	servers ya but for general desktop use i think edgy is better, i'm loving feisty atm
2007-03-17T16:57:00.000Z	sethk	xtknight	only better if it does something that you need to do that dapper doesn't do.
2007-03-17T16:57:00.000Z	sethk	xtknight	it is a BIG mistake to upgrade only because an upgrade is available
2007-03-17T16:57:00.000Z	xtknight	sethk	i'm just someone who always likes the latest stuff.  i use the newest kernels for kvm support and stuff
2007-03-17T16:58:00.000Z	sethk	xtknight	on a system that isn't critical to your network that may be a good attitude,  But in general it is not, and thus "no reason to use dapper" is 100% wrong.
2007-03-17T16:59:00.000Z	xtknight	sethk	imo 'bobby's home pc' != critical in most cases and the aesthetic/small improvements will mean more to him
2007-03-17T16:59:00.000Z	xtknight	sethk	i'd prolly use Debian Sarge for servers
2007-03-17T05:00:00.000Z	sethk	xtknight	I'm only pointing out that there _are_ reasons to run earlier releases.  They may not apply to you, and they may not apply to most people, but they do exist.
2007-03-17T05:14:00.000Z	sethk	xtknight	what happens that is undesirable if you don't disable simple sharing?
2007-03-17T05:15:00.000Z	xtknight	sethk	can't remember exactly but i've never liked it
2007-04-13T11:21:00.000Z	sethk	xtknight	xinerama works well for me.  anything more specific?
2007-04-13T11:21:00.000Z	xtknight	sethk	when i enable it (Xinerama "1")  my X session lasts <10 seconds.
2007-04-13T11:22:00.000Z	sethk	xtknight	any useful information in the X log?
2007-04-13T11:22:00.000Z	xtknight	sethk	hrm one moment
2007-04-13T11:26:00.000Z	xtknight	sethk	here's the logs http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/15420
2007-04-13T11:27:00.000Z	xtknight	sethk	it thinks my secondary lcd hooked up via vga (no dvi cable atm) is a crt, but i dont think that's the problem
