2008-06-23T11:58:00.000Z	mynetdude		blah forget it
2008-06-23T11:59:00.000Z	mynetdude		just ask your question and wait patiently, someone who knows will come along ioioio
2008-06-23T11:59:00.000Z	mynetdude		I know... you're still spamming but alas
2008-06-23T12:00:00.000Z	mynetdude		so let me get this straight you can install kubuntu and all the others right in along with ubuntu?
2008-06-23T12:00:00.000Z	mynetdude		does it have to be partitioned?
2008-06-23T12:00:00.000Z	mynetdude		so for each ubuntu variation I have to partition?
2008-06-23T12:00:00.000Z	ioioio	mynetdude	Can you please answer?
2008-06-23T12:01:00.000Z	ioioio		Noone answer...
2008-06-23T12:01:00.000Z	ioioio		And I've asked my question three times
2008-06-23T12:01:00.000Z	mynetdude	ioioio	no I can't because I don't know, would you rather have an answer saying something like "go wash floors"?
2008-06-23T12:01:00.000Z	mynetdude		oh I just want the desktop, not the whole distro
2008-06-23T12:02:00.000Z	mynetdude		can the desktops be installed via synaptics?
2008-06-23T12:02:00.000Z	mynetdude		really... I'm getting more intrigued by this...
2008-06-23T12:02:00.000Z	ioioio		But it is so important! javascript:galleriaN("Europei","2008/06_Giugno/europei/23.&1");
2008-06-23T12:02:00.000Z	ioioio		Sorry
2008-06-23T12:03:00.000Z	ioioio		ï»¿I have a BIG problem trying to install Ubuntu. When I load Gparted, it doesn't show any partition I have....although they appear in terminal if I write "fdisk -l". What should I do?
2008-06-23T12:03:00.000Z	mynetdude	ioioio	I'll just say this.. not that I recommend you do it but IMO use the guided install
2008-06-23T12:04:00.000Z	ioioio	mynetdude	it doesn't show any partition!
2008-06-23T12:04:00.000Z	mynetdude	ioioio	the guided install would create a partition and all that for you
2008-06-23T12:04:00.000Z	mynetdude	ioioio	ah well then I don't know, sorry
