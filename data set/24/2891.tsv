2009-06-25T04:27:00.000Z	pw-toxic		hi - i'm trying to set up a router with my ubuntu system.. therefore i did echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward  but my packages dont get forwarded..
2009-06-25T04:27:00.000Z	pw-toxic		is there anyting special with ubuntu?
2009-06-25T04:28:00.000Z	pw-toxic		wireshark tells me that it receives all packages from my host
2009-06-25T04:28:00.000Z	zamba	pw-toxic	have you set up masquerading?
2009-06-25T04:28:00.000Z	pw-toxic	zamba	why masquerading?.. not its just a local network
2009-06-25T04:28:00.000Z	zamba	pw-toxic	or is it plain routing?
2009-06-25T04:29:00.000Z	zamba	pw-toxic	local network with official ips, i presume?
2009-06-25T04:29:00.000Z	pw-toxic	zamba	we have two local networks here.. mine is 192.168.42/24  and the other one is 192.168.1/24
2009-06-25T04:29:00.000Z	zamba	pw-toxic	then you have to set up masquerading
2009-06-25T04:29:00.000Z	pw-toxic		192.168.42.1 is my linxu router with two network cards.. the pc im currently chatting on
2009-06-25T04:30:00.000Z	pw-toxic	zamba	but masquerading is something of NAT ?!  i dont want a NAT (by now).. i have two subnetworks which should be able to talk to each other
2009-06-25T04:30:00.000Z	zamba	pw-toxic	oh.. to each other..
2009-06-25T04:30:00.000Z	zamba	pw-toxic	just make sure the firewall isn't blocking anything
2009-06-25T04:30:00.000Z	zamba	pw-toxic	check with iptables
2009-06-25T04:32:00.000Z	pw-toxic	zamba	can i completly disable iptables? ;)
2009-06-25T04:33:00.000Z	zamba	pw-toxic	just make sure that the default policy is set to ACCEPT and then just flush all chains
2009-06-25T04:33:00.000Z	zamba	pw-toxic	.. in that order ,)
2009-06-25T04:41:00.000Z	pw-toxic	zamba	iptables -A FORWARD -j ACCEPT
2009-06-25T04:41:00.000Z	pw-toxic		is this correct?
2009-06-25T04:49:00.000Z	zamba	pw-toxic	for instance
2009-06-25T04:51:00.000Z	pw-toxic	zamba	still doesnt work.. i think the firewall isnt the problem.. i just want my packages beeing forwarded by this machine..
2009-06-25T04:52:00.000Z	pw-toxic		do i have to do something special after echo > 1 /proc .. ip_foward ?
2009-06-25T05:25:00.000Z	pw-toxic	zamba	now i know the problem.. i got a default route to the server of my brother but this pc doesnt know my subnet ;) so my request is just dropped
2009-06-25T05:25:00.000Z	pw-toxic	zamba	i will have to do NAT
