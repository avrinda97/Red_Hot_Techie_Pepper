2010-02-02T11:13:00.000Z	hyperstream		Im looking for a tutorial/guide that will allow me to setup my Ubuntu box as a network share, i know samba does this , but ive been having huge drama's with making it not ask for a password etc, (LIKE windows to windows share) any suggestions
2010-02-02T11:14:00.000Z	mohhoh	hyperstream	share with what exactly
2010-02-02T11:15:00.000Z	hyperstream	mohhoh	i want to share my documents/music/movies and so forth, so my father and sister can access the files, they use windows xp
2010-02-02T11:18:00.000Z	mohhoh	hyperstream	did you try looking on google
2010-02-02T11:19:00.000Z	hyperstream	mohhoh	roughly 3-4 hours yes ?
2010-02-02T11:20:00.000Z	mohhoh	hyperstream	you also need to have a shared hdd or shared DATA partition that is fat 23 i think hold on i'll take a look
2010-02-02T11:20:00.000Z	hyperstream	mohhoh	that would make sense, i think it maybe NTFS :(, let me double check that
2010-02-02T11:21:00.000Z	mohhoh	hyperstream	you can get ubuntu to mount ntfs. not sure about windows
2010-02-02T11:22:00.000Z	hyperstream	mohhoh	thank you for the advice abvout fat32/ntfs, ill have a bit more googling
2010-02-02T11:22:00.000Z	mohhoh	hyperstream	have you networked the computers together
2010-02-02T11:24:00.000Z	mohhoh	hyperstream	http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/partitioning
2010-02-02T11:24:00.000Z	hyperstream	mohhoh	yes, when i access the Ubuntu share from a windows xp box, its prompting for a username and password, as my father is 60 years of age, he is learning but the username password thing is a hassel, yet from windows share to windows there is no password prompt
2010-02-02T11:24:00.000Z	hyperstream	mohhoh	thanks :)
2010-02-02T11:25:00.000Z	mohhoh	hyperstream	 so what that means id that xp is asking for a password to conect to ubuntu
2010-02-02T11:26:00.000Z	hyperstream	mohhoh	yes, just trying to figure out if its possible to have it not prompt.
2010-02-02T11:26:00.000Z	hyperstream	mohhoh	the xp machine has no password set for the account, i remember reading that i need to add an account to the ubuntu box, but that requires a password
2010-02-02T11:26:00.000Z	mohhoh	hyperstream	when you provide the corect info it should have a remember function
2010-02-02T11:26:00.000Z	hyperstream	mohhoh	still prompts everytime ;/
2010-02-02T11:27:00.000Z	mohhoh	hyperstream	you have to create a password when installing ubuntu right
2010-02-02T11:27:00.000Z	hyperstream	mohhoh	yes sure do
2010-02-02T11:27:00.000Z	mohhoh	hyperstream	thats the root password. did you try that
2010-02-02T11:28:00.000Z	hyperstream	mohhoh	 i can access the share if i use my creditals for the UBUNTU box, how ever the WINDOWSXP laptop does not have a password for the account, it auto log's on, i read somewhere that to stop the prompts i need to setup a USER ACCOUNT on the ubuntu box that matches the windows pc accessing it(to skip the password prompt) the WINDOWSxp machine has no password.
2010-02-02T11:29:00.000Z	hyperstream	mohhoh	im not setting up a user account on my ubuntu box that has no password, if that makes sense
2010-02-02T11:30:00.000Z	mohhoh	hyperstream	if xp askes for password from ubuntu give it the user account and password. that may work
