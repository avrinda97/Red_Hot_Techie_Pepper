2005-05-06T14:13:00.000Z	hksdu		anyone here is using nVidia proprietory driver? any 2D performance notice? between I am using X.Org nVidia driver and the 2D performance is not so great as I am using GF2 MX400 64MB
2005-05-06T14:14:00.000Z	holycow	hksdu	big difference every time i install nvidia drivers...
2005-05-06T14:15:00.000Z	hksdu	holycow	so you mean the proprietory one is much faster?
2005-05-06T14:15:00.000Z	holycow	hksdu	every time i've installed them, yes huge difference
2005-05-06T14:16:00.000Z	hksdu	holycow	can I install from universe/munltiverse? or I have to install by downloading the driver from nvidia site?
2005-05-06T14:17:00.000Z	holycow	hksdu	both, but it is recommended to install from universe because it is easy to uninstall them as well using apt/dpkg/whatever
2005-05-06T14:17:00.000Z	holycow	hksdu	the instructions are on the ubuntu website, search for binary drivers nvidia or some such
2005-05-06T14:18:00.000Z	hksdu	holycow	when I search in there, I don't see proprietory driver though...okay...thank you.
2005-05-06T14:18:00.000Z	holycow	hksdu	its there, i just don't have the link onhand
2005-05-06T14:19:00.000Z	hksdu	holycow	thank you very much..let me try
2005-05-06T14:29:00.000Z	hksdu	holycow	I have it installed but how do I know if I am using that driver?
2005-05-06T14:30:00.000Z	holycow	hksdu	you can check and see if yoru /etc/X11/xorg.conf file has the 'nvidia' driver instead of 'nv', or when you restartx you get an nvidia logo on the front
2005-05-06T14:32:00.000Z	hksdu	holycow	it is using nv, then do I change it manually? or I use synaptics to change?
2005-05-06T14:33:00.000Z	holycow	hksdu	change it to nvidia manually with sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf ... and save
2005-05-06T14:33:00.000Z	holycow	hksdu	oh and make sure you have a backup of the file just in case
2005-05-06T14:33:00.000Z	hksdu	holycow	just that driver and no other settings?
2005-05-06T14:33:00.000Z	hksdu	holycow	okay
2005-05-06T14:34:00.000Z	holycow	hksdu	the site has specific things you need to change, also isn't there an nvidia config package you run at the end after installing the drivers that does this for you? i can't remember
2005-05-06T14:34:00.000Z	holycow	hksdu	make sure nv is changed to nvidia and you need to make sure some modules don't load, those should be on the sit as well
2005-05-06T14:34:00.000Z	holycow	hksdu	then sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart
2005-05-06T14:34:00.000Z	hksdu	holycow	I didn't use apt-get, :P, I used synaptics...
2005-05-06T14:35:00.000Z	hksdu	holycow	okay
2005-05-06T14:35:00.000Z	holycow	hksdu	same thing, synaptic just calls apt get for you in the background
2005-05-06T14:40:00.000Z	holycow	hksdu	so?
