2010-03-29T13:36:00.000Z	Xdept		Hey, Can anyone give me a hand with this, I'm running ubuntu 8.10 and im trying to upgrade to 9.04 using a disk, there are a few problems though. 1)It's a mac mini with a semi stuffed internal drive(Burn't Cd's Do not read) 2) for some reason it hates mounting ISO's 3) i got an external drive working but it wont let me install from an external drive 4) i'm on dial up
2010-03-29T13:37:00.000Z	TG_tigger	Xdept	- you have a live CD you are working with?
2010-03-29T13:38:00.000Z	TG_tigger	Xdept	- Will your minimac boot from a usb drive?
2010-03-29T13:39:00.000Z	TG_tigger	Xdept	- what size and how full is your internal drive?
2010-03-29T13:41:00.000Z	TG_tigger	Xdept	- That should be more then enough room. Have you tried loading the OS onto the external drive you mentioned?
2010-03-29T13:42:00.000Z	Xdept	TG_tigger	How do you mean ?
2010-03-29T13:43:00.000Z	TG_tigger	Xdept	- Sorry. Got y thoughts mixed up.
2010-03-29T13:44:00.000Z	TG_tigger	Xdept	- have you tried downloading the OS to your minimac directly not set up for a live cd?
2010-03-29T13:46:00.000Z	TG_tigger	Xdept	- goto the Ubuntu website and look into the info they have there that would involve partitioning and installing Ubuntu in its own partition.
2010-03-29T13:47:00.000Z	TG_tigger	Xdept	- this would probably setup a duel boot allowing you to choose your mac OS or Ubuntu
2010-03-29T13:49:00.000Z	TG_tigger	Xdept	- OK. While running 8.10 goto your update manager and refresh it. This should tell you that 9.04 or even 10.x is available to download
2010-03-29T13:50:00.000Z	TG_tigger	Xdept	- choose to download 9.04. Your system should do what needs to be done for you.
2010-03-29T13:50:00.000Z	Xdept	TG_tigger	I can't download it though
2010-03-29T13:51:00.000Z	TG_tigger	Xdept	- It should work of the CD you have. If not try burning a CD using a friends computer then running the new CD on your Minimac
2010-03-29T13:54:00.000Z	TG_tigger	Xdept	- Have you tried burning more then one copy from your best computer?
2010-03-29T13:55:00.000Z	TG_tigger	Xdept	- you said that you use dial-up right?
2010-03-29T13:55:00.000Z	Xdept	TG_tigger	That's right
2010-03-29T13:56:00.000Z	TG_tigger	Xdept	- What it might be is a glitch when downloading the cd to be burned. Is it possible to access a faster web connection long enough to burn another copy?
2010-03-29T13:57:00.000Z	TG_tigger	Xdept	- Could your mate have had the same problem?
2010-03-29T13:59:00.000Z	TG_tigger	Xdept	- maybe you minimac is just a very cranky computer that does not want to be modified... :-)
2010-03-29T14:00:00.000Z	TG_tigger	Xdept	- It could have an *accident* you know... Some sort of fatal error...
2010-03-29T14:00:00.000Z	Xdept	TG_tigger	Lol, How do you mean ?
2010-03-29T14:01:00.000Z	TG_tigger	Xdept	- what I did with one of my old pcs... Had it encounter a large blunt object. Several times in quick succession.
2010-03-29T14:02:00.000Z	TG_tigger	Xdept	- satisfaction... ;-)
