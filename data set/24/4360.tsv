2009-10-05T03:50:00.000Z	Gnea	jane_uk	why are you trying to install grub to the MBR of a partition?
2009-10-05T03:51:00.000Z	Gnea	jane_uk	please, use the pastebin
2009-10-05T03:51:00.000Z	Gnea	jane_uk	that is irrelevent, c: is still a partition
2009-10-05T03:51:00.000Z	Gnea	jane_uk	yes, please check your scrollback
2009-10-05T03:52:00.000Z	Gnea	jane_uk	you've been told many times now
2009-10-05T03:52:00.000Z	Gnea	jane_uk	but to boot into it you need to have access from the MBR of the whole drive, which is hd0, not hd0,1 or hd0,5
2009-10-05T03:53:00.000Z	Gnea	jane_uk	that's because you haven't read what we've been telling you. either that, or you're not understanding some basics on hard drive partitioning
2009-10-05T03:53:00.000Z	Gnea	jane_uk	do you know what the MBR is?
2009-10-05T03:54:00.000Z	Gnea	jane_uk	what was reinstalled?
2009-10-05T03:54:00.000Z	Gnea	jane_uk	by what?
2009-10-05T03:55:00.000Z	Gnea	jane_uk	please, don't assume that I know what you're talking about - please provide some detail
2009-10-05T03:56:00.000Z	Gnea	jane_uk	okay, so you reinstalled XP and now you can't select between XP and Linux, right?
2009-10-05T03:56:00.000Z	Gnea	jane_uk	please see the first URL that DigitalKiwi pointed out to you
2009-10-05T03:56:00.000Z	Gnea	jane_uk	it has full details on how to fix it
2009-10-05T03:57:00.000Z	Gnea	jane_uk	what? no, just go here:  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestoreGrub  and read it, follow directions.
