2012-05-03T08:11:00.000Z	JZApples	wylde	isn't it apport-bug?
2012-05-03T08:12:00.000Z	wylde	JZApples	you can use apport collect if you've already files a bug. 'apport collect bugnumber. But yeah I think you can use apport the same way as ubuntu-bug.
2012-05-03T08:13:00.000Z	JZApples	wylde	i don't actually know what i'm talking about, i was just trying to help :)
2012-05-03T08:14:00.000Z	JZApples	wylde	when i "man ubuntu-bug" it gives me apport-bug
2012-05-03T08:14:00.000Z	wylde	JZApples	yep, ubuntu-bug is provided by apport.
2012-05-03T08:14:00.000Z	JZApples	wylde	so the same thing, gotcha
2012-05-03T08:16:00.000Z	JZApples	wylde	must be the same thing that happens when you report an error through the gui?  i reported one earlier when using qsynth but i should probably just install ubuntu studio.
2012-05-03T08:17:00.000Z	wylde	JZApples	yep :)
2012-05-03T08:50:00.000Z	wylde	JZApples	Just curious, what do you need to do remotely that you want vnc for?
2012-05-03T08:50:00.000Z	JZApples	wylde	connect to my computers from my touchpad
2012-05-03T08:51:00.000Z	wylde	JZApples	ahh ok, I was just wondering because I just use ssh and the sftp it provides. With the -X option I can open graphical applications as well.
2012-05-03T08:51:00.000Z	JZApples	wylde	i turned uPnP off on my router and haven't opened up any ports
2012-05-03T08:51:00.000Z	JZApples	wylde	you can have a gui with SSH?!?!?!
2012-05-03T08:52:00.000Z	wylde	JZApples	well you CAN get the full desktop, but it's much faster to just launch the individual applications, and their gui opens locally :)
2012-05-03T08:53:00.000Z	JZApples	wylde	not sure how that would work with WebOS though
2012-05-03T08:53:00.000Z	wylde	JZApples	eg. I ssh into my remote system using ssh -X hostname , then launch nautilus, or gedit filename. :)
2012-05-03T08:54:00.000Z	wylde	JZApples	yeah I don't know. If you can run ssh and have an xserver you can do it. Even on windows using putty and ummm I used to use cygwin for my xserver...mind you that was eons ago :)
2012-05-03T08:55:00.000Z	JZApples	wylde	yeah i can't run those things on the WebOS partition.  I did setup ubuntu and lxde (i think), but decided to stick with WebOS.  TigerVNC is working for me, but i'm not sure about vino on the ubuntu box.  My girlfriend says that messages keep popping up asking permission to connect to the desktop.
2012-05-03T08:56:00.000Z	wylde	JZApples	yeah, I honestly have no idea about WebOs. I beleive you can disable those messages from vino.
2012-05-03T08:56:00.000Z	JZApples	wylde	i don't want to disable them, i want to know why they're popping up while i'm at work, not attempting to connect to it.
2012-05-03T08:57:00.000Z	wylde	JZApples	ahh ok, that shouldn't be happening then heh.
2012-05-03T08:57:00.000Z	JZApples	wylde	then again i don't ever see them, so who knows what she's really talking about
2012-05-03T08:58:00.000Z	wylde	JZApples	wish I could be more help, I don't actually use vnc for remote connections at all.
2012-05-03T09:03:00.000Z	JZApples	wylde	yeah thanks dude.  I don't blame you, i've only heard unsecure things about it.  From what she tells me it says "someone is attempting to connect to your computer allow/don't allow" and she either ignores it or clicks don't allow.  i'm gonna check out the router logs
