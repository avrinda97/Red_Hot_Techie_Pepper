2011-10-26T01:59:00.000Z	sam555		hello all
2011-10-26T01:59:00.000Z	sam555		how do I load the 11.10 os for installation from a usb drive?
2011-10-26T01:59:00.000Z	reisio	sam555	you could use unetbootin, usb-creator, dd
2011-10-26T02:00:00.000Z	reisio	sam555	that should work
2011-10-26T02:00:00.000Z	sam555	reisio	however, it won't boot into the gui, it boots into the busy box shell
2011-10-26T02:00:00.000Z	reisio	sam555	and what image was it you used?
2011-10-26T02:01:00.000Z	sam555	reisio	the one here http://www.ubuntu.com/download/ubuntu/download
2011-10-26T02:02:00.000Z	reisio	sam555	it's possible your graphics hardware has confused the image
2011-10-26T02:02:00.000Z	reisio	sam555	you might try the alternate install image, which should present you with a framebuffer installer
2011-10-26T02:02:00.000Z	sam555	reisio	gotcha!
2011-10-26T02:02:00.000Z	reisio	sam555	similar to the beginning stages of installing Windows
2011-10-26T02:02:00.000Z	reisio	sam555	takes less complex graphics automagick
2011-10-26T02:03:00.000Z	sam555	reisio	it is an old dell pc, should we just use 10 instead?  We were using 9, but the new printer we got, won't work with 9.
2011-10-26T02:03:00.000Z	reisio	sam555	I'm sure you can get it to work, but if you don't have time to debug...
2011-10-26T02:04:00.000Z	reisio	sam555	what printer is it?
2011-10-26T02:04:00.000Z	sam555	reisio	it's an hp deskjet 1055
2011-10-26T02:05:00.000Z	reisio	sam555	is that just a printer or an all-in-one?
2011-10-26T02:06:00.000Z	sam555	reisio	all in one
2011-10-26T02:06:00.000Z	sam555	reisio	we're going to use a 10.10 iso instead.  Thanks for the info.  We're going to lunch now.  You've been very helpful!
2011-10-26T02:08:00.000Z	reisio	sam555	I bet hplip supports that
2011-10-26T02:08:00.000Z	reisio	sam555	it only lists 1050, but usually a close model # is enough
2011-10-26T03:42:00.000Z	reisio	sam555	any you like
2011-10-26T03:43:00.000Z	sam555	reisio	kk, you are so helpful!
2011-10-26T03:47:00.000Z	reisio	sam555	server hardware probably isn't a priority for the desktop image's graphics autoconfigurators
