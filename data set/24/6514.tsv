2005-10-18T15:58:00.000Z	wrabbit		Maybe I need to try something other then Gnome.  It seems to be bogging up everything
2005-10-18T16:00:00.000Z	wrabbit		Just installed the latest kernel and it's not all that much different (if at all)
2005-10-18T16:02:00.000Z	wrabbit		Don't wanna go back to ms though
2005-10-18T16:02:00.000Z	Ng	wrabbit	win2k is also 5 years old ;)
2005-10-18T16:02:00.000Z	wrabbit	Ng	Yup... good point
2005-10-18T09:45:00.000Z	Ng	wrabbit	are there any cdrom related lines in /etc/fstab?
2005-10-18T09:45:00.000Z	wrabbit	Ng	no idea
2005-10-18T09:45:00.000Z	Ng	wrabbit	have a look :)
2005-10-18T09:46:00.000Z	wrabbit	Ng	Just a tic
2005-10-18T09:47:00.000Z	wrabbit	Ng	I can't work out where the file browser for XFCE is
2005-10-18T09:47:00.000Z	Ng	wrabbit	"grep cdrom /etc/fstab" in a terminal
2005-10-18T09:49:00.000Z	wrabbit	Ng	sorry... didn't highlight.  /dev/hdc        /media/cdrom0   udf,iso9660 user,noauto     0       0
2005-10-18T09:49:00.000Z	Ng	wrabbit	hmm, well that looks normal
2005-10-18T09:49:00.000Z	Ng	wrabbit	what are you using to try and play the dvd? might be worth running it from a terminal, see what errors (if any) it spits out
2005-10-18T09:49:00.000Z	wrabbit	Ng	 :( Well...dvd playback won't install
2005-10-18T09:50:00.000Z	wrabbit	Ng	Feel like walking me through the commands?
2005-10-18T09:50:00.000Z	wrabbit	Ng	totem
2005-10-18T09:52:00.000Z	Ng	wrabbit	install libdvdread3 and run: sudo /usr/share/doc/libdvdread3/examples/install-css.sh
2005-10-18T09:53:00.000Z	wrabbit	Ng	k.... just a tic
2005-10-18T09:55:00.000Z	Ng	wrabbit	ok, close totem if it's still open, start it again and try the DVD again
2005-10-18T09:57:00.000Z	wrabbit	Ng	nope.. didn't work.
2005-10-18T09:57:00.000Z	Ng	wrabbit	same error as last time? about the mountpoint?
2005-10-18T09:59:00.000Z	Ng	wrabbit	damn. sorry, I'm stumped without a machine to compare on and it's time for me to go home anyway. sorry and good luck!
2005-10-18T09:59:00.000Z	wrabbit	Ng	thanks
