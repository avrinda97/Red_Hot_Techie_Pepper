2005-07-11T10:25:00.000Z	jasoncohen		why do people re-install when something doesn't work and expect it to work?
2005-07-11T10:26:00.000Z	jmjones	jasoncohen	depends on what went wrong
2005-07-11T10:26:00.000Z	jmjones	jasoncohen	i've reinstalled tons of times because i thought I had installed something bad and couldn't track down waht it was.....
2005-07-11T10:26:00.000Z	jasoncohen	jmjones	that's why you should use synaptic
2005-07-11T10:26:00.000Z	jasoncohen	jmjones	it keeps a log of all packages you install
2005-07-11T10:27:00.000Z	jasoncohen	jmjones	you can just backtrack
2005-07-11T10:27:00.000Z	jmjones	jasoncohen	ummm...yeah - i use synaptic
2005-07-11T10:27:00.000Z	jmjones	jasoncohen	and it turned out to not be a package install problem
2005-07-11T10:27:00.000Z	jasoncohen	jmjones	what was the problem?
2005-07-11T10:27:00.000Z	jmjones	jasoncohen	and i used google and found no help for my problem
2005-07-11T10:27:00.000Z	jmjones	jasoncohen	and nobody here could help either....
2005-07-11T10:27:00.000Z	jmjones	jasoncohen	gnome freezing at startup
2005-07-11T10:28:00.000Z	jasoncohen	jmjones	so, you reinstalled and now it works fine?
2005-07-11T10:28:00.000Z	jmjones	jasoncohen	no
2005-07-11T10:29:00.000Z	jmjones	jasoncohen	yes i reinstalled and no reinstalling didn't fix the problem, but yes, it works fine now
2005-07-11T10:29:00.000Z	jasoncohen	jmjones	how did you fix it?
2005-07-11T10:29:00.000Z	jmjones	jasoncohen	i figured out that it just needed to sit there.  after 5 or 10 minutes, it finally came up and hasn't "frozen" since.
2005-07-11T10:30:00.000Z	jasoncohen	jmjones	did you check what was running in top?
2005-07-11T10:31:00.000Z	jmjones	jasoncohen	yeah - nothing was eating up CPU.  gdm was running....
2005-07-11T10:31:00.000Z	jmjones	jasoncohen	i'm chalking it up to something just blocking for a while needing to timeout or something....  works great now..
2005-07-11T10:31:00.000Z	jasoncohen	jmjones	that's good
2005-07-11T10:32:00.000Z	jmjones	jasoncohen	you should be able to read all about the adventure on o'reilly's site soon
2005-07-11T10:33:00.000Z	jasoncohen	jmjones	he had the same problem?
2005-07-11T10:33:00.000Z	jmjones	jasoncohen	who?
