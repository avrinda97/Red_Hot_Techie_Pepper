2011-02-23T13:36:00.000Z	coz_	syrinx	 it is indeed :)
2011-02-23T13:36:00.000Z	coz_	syrinx	11.04 is out there for testing
2011-02-23T13:37:00.000Z	coz_	syrinx	if you wish to listen in on some reports  or join in at some point you would have to go to the #ubuntu+1  channel
2011-02-23T13:40:00.000Z	coz_	syrinx	 what is the issue?
2011-02-23T13:40:00.000Z	coz_	syrinx	 ok
2011-02-23T13:41:00.000Z	coz_	syrinx	 understood
2011-02-23T13:42:00.000Z	coz_	syrinx	 sounds like a good plan
2011-02-23T13:42:00.000Z	coz_	syrinx	 what is the issue?
2011-02-23T13:42:00.000Z	coz_	syrinx	 ah ok
2011-02-23T13:44:00.000Z	coz_	syrinx	 what is on that system right now in terms of OS
2011-02-23T13:45:00.000Z	coz_	syrinx	 oh I see... did you test internet access with the live cd?
2011-02-23T13:46:00.000Z	coz_	syrinx	 that would be the first step
2011-02-23T13:47:00.000Z	coz_	syrinx	 test with an ubuntu desktop live cd
2011-02-23T13:47:00.000Z	coz_	syrinx	 if that works you can download the minimal install cd   which is only  megs and at one point it will prompt you to install things including a server
2011-02-23T13:48:00.000Z	coz_	syrinx	 the minimal install cd is only 12 megs
