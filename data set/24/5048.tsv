2007-07-17T16:48:00.000Z	dsnyders		Hi all!  How do I shut down multiple machines when my UPS signals low battery?
2007-07-17T16:50:00.000Z	Jordan_U	dsnyders	ssh in and run "shutdown -h now" as root, how to trigger that to happen I don't know
2007-07-17T16:51:00.000Z	dsnyders	Jordan_U	The shutdown is automatic on the machine that monitors the UPS, but I have others on the same UPS that also need to be shut down automatically.
2007-07-17T16:52:00.000Z	Jordan_U	dsnyders	Is the one that monitors the UPS also *NIX ?
2007-07-17T16:55:00.000Z	Jordan_U	dsnyders	You could just make a script that whenever it is told by the UPS to shut down it first ssh's into the other boxes and shuts them down
2008-09-18T07:39:00.000Z	Jordan_U	dsnyders	python most likely, don't personally know how to do GUI programming with python thouch
2008-09-18T07:42:00.000Z	dsnyders	Jordan_U	I was thinking of possibly python, but I know almost nothing about it.  Does it come in an interpreted environment, or is it compiled?
2008-09-18T07:44:00.000Z	Jordan_U	dsnyders	Interpreted ( it uses a JIT )
2008-09-18T07:56:00.000Z	dsnyders	Jordan_U	Python looks promising.  There is a turtle-like graphics library/module/whatever-its-called available.
2009-09-27T10:41:00.000Z	Jordan_U	dsnyders	You can set the mount point from nautilus in properties
2010-02-27T07:35:00.000Z	Jordan_U	dsnyders	Log into a failsafe gnome session and change the default resolution to something your monitor supports
2010-02-27T07:35:00.000Z	dsnyders	Jordan_U	It happens with failsafe gnome as well.
2010-02-27T07:35:00.000Z	Jordan_U	dsnyders	Or it can probably be changed in gconf-editor
2010-02-27T07:36:00.000Z	dsnyders	Jordan_U	I'll take a look at gconf-editor
2010-02-27T08:37:00.000Z	dsnyders	Jordan_U	I've got gconf-editor running (finally).  Any suggestions as to what to look for regarding my monitor display issue?
2010-03-03T11:20:00.000Z	Jordan_U	dsnyders	darolu: Blender is the vi of 3D software :)
2010-03-03T11:24:00.000Z	dsnyders	Jordan_U	I'm looking for more of a gedit of 3D software.  However, I'm glad you didn't say blender was the Emacs of 3D software.
2011-08-23T04:26:00.000Z	Jordan_U	dsnyders	Had the word "dumpfile" in the name or in its contents?
2011-08-23T04:27:00.000Z	dsnyders	Jordan_U	it had the word dumpfile in the contents.  I forget the name.
2011-08-23T04:30:00.000Z	Jordan_U	dsnyders	Try "grep -R dumpfile ~/"
2012-03-27T05:47:00.000Z	Jordan_U	dsnyders	diff dir1 dir2
2012-03-27T05:49:00.000Z	dsnyders	Jordan_U	does diff do md5sums, or does it just compare filenames/sizes.
2012-03-27T05:53:00.000Z	Jordan_U	dsnyders	Neither, it compares contents.
2012-06-17T03:14:00.000Z	Jordan_U	dsnyders	Most "professional" audio software uses Jack, which at least in the past has been difficult to setup. If you start with Ubuntu Studio you get Jack (and other nice things) setup by default.
