2012-03-16T07:00:00.000Z	gdea73		I had xsensors installed already before I lost access to the DE.
2012-03-16T07:00:00.000Z	gdea73		now when I boot I get kicked to tty1 right away; tty7 shows the status menus
2012-03-16T07:00:00.000Z	Dulak	gdea73	My battery capacity went up when I moved from lucid to precise,  They have apparently fixed whatever regression in the kernel was causing the power issues.
2012-03-16T07:01:00.000Z	gdea73	Dulak	thanks, though I'm running Maverick on Kernel 2.6.35-32-generic, and I already tried the acpi=force option for extended battery life mentioned across the web.
2012-03-16T07:02:00.000Z	Dulak	gdea73	There is a regression somewhere in 2.6.x that causes it to eat more power than it should, the acpi=force thing doesn't fix that, it fixes another issue with acpi not working correctly so none of the power saving works.
2012-03-16T07:11:00.000Z	gdea73	Dulak	it was a utility that allowd you to pin stuff to the system tray
2012-03-16T07:10:00.000Z	gdea73	Dulak	Do you know if AllTray was ever updated to work with anything other than </= 10.10?
2012-03-16T07:11:00.000Z	Dulak	gdea73	I don't know what AllTray is so no
2012-03-16T07:23:00.000Z	Dulak	gdea73	They offer ubuntu debs on that site?
2012-03-16T07:27:00.000Z	gdea73	Dulak	on the AMD site? Apparently... (?)
2012-03-16T07:40:00.000Z	gdea73	Dulak	correct.
2012-03-16T07:40:00.000Z	Dulak	gdea73	you lucky bastid
2012-03-16T07:41:00.000Z	gdea73	Dulak	lol
2012-03-16T07:42:00.000Z	Dulak	gdea73	suspend has always been a bit buggy, I stopped trying and moved to hibernate instead.  It's a bit slower, but not as buggy.
2012-03-16T07:46:00.000Z	Dulak	gdea73	I am very jealous of your 16:9 laptop screen.
2012-03-16T07:46:00.000Z	gdea73	Dulak	haha it's rather nice... when the drivers work >_>
2012-03-16T07:46:00.000Z	Dulak	gdea73	what version of ubuntu?
2012-03-16T07:46:00.000Z	gdea73	Dulak	10.10 x86_64.
2012-03-16T07:49:00.000Z	Dulak	gdea73	That is a gamer laptop, you will never get good battery out of it, because it's aimed at performance, not power saving.
2012-03-16T07:49:00.000Z	gdea73	Dulak	but it doesn't *look* as lame as a "gaming laptop"! haha. It's a Lenovo.
2012-03-16T07:50:00.000Z	Dulak	gdea73	Yes but the cpu and graphics are typical gamer laptop parts, so your battery will never be good.
2012-03-16T07:50:00.000Z	gdea73	Dulak	meh, okay. I don't emphasize portability a lot. I just expected its rating of 4.5 hours to be semi-true, which it is. 2.75?
2012-03-16T07:51:00.000Z	Dulak	gdea73	Be lucky, I bought an amd gamer laptop that was super cheap for my dad for xmas, and his battery lasts 1 hr 15 minutes.
2012-03-16T07:52:00.000Z	Dulak	gdea73	If the cpu supports frequency scaling you can get a lot of mileage from using the ondemand govenor and not using the discrete graphics.
