2007-07-29T14:52:00.000Z	n2diy	urie1	you can't move the sliders, or check the click boxes?
2007-07-29T14:53:00.000Z	n2diy	urie1	keep playing, your in, you just need to find the right settings.
2007-07-29T14:58:00.000Z	n2diy	urie1	if you see the icon on the tool bar, and can play with it the sound daemon is running, the problem is elsewhere, speakers, cables, volume control, etc...
2007-07-29T15:01:00.000Z	n2diy	urie1	they play in windows, good. You have the icon on the tool bar, and can right click on it, so the daemon is running. It is a config problem, or loose nuts between the keyboard and monitor. :) ;)
2007-07-29T15:03:00.000Z	n2diy	urie1	mute is selected, or one of the click boxes under/near a slider isn' selected, play, experiment!
2007-07-29T15:04:00.000Z	n2diy	urie1	ok, I'm at a loss then.
2007-07-29T15:05:00.000Z	n2diy	urie1	wait...
2007-07-29T15:06:00.000Z	n2diy	urie1	go to menu>system>preferences> sound, can you get them to play?
2007-07-29T15:09:00.000Z	urie1	n2diy	no its not working
2007-07-29T15:09:00.000Z	n2diy	urie1	Damn!
2007-07-29T15:10:00.000Z	n2diy	urie1	and your sure your cat didn't unplug your speakers, they aren't muted, and the volume is turned up?
2007-07-29T15:53:00.000Z	n2diy	urie1	what did you compile!!??
2007-07-29T15:54:00.000Z	n2diy	urie1	any errors?
2007-07-29T15:55:00.000Z	n2diy	urie1	jees, cool, I hope you are keeping a notebook, a year or two from now, it will bite you again, and you'll wish you had notes.
2007-07-29T16:00:00.000Z	n2diy	urie1	god helps those that help themselves, and so does #Ubuntu!
