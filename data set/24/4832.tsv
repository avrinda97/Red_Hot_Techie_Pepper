2007-01-05T09:47:00.000Z	klees		hmm
2007-01-05T09:47:00.000Z	xtknight	klees	odd.  sure nothing else like updatedb is running while ur idleness/screensaver gets triggered?
2007-01-05T09:48:00.000Z	klees	xtknight	positive
2007-01-05T09:43:00.000Z	xtknight	klees	is anything else accelerated/
2007-01-05T09:44:00.000Z	xtknight	klees	does glxinfo show direct rendering yes (assuming you're not using xgl)?
2007-01-05T09:44:00.000Z	klees	xtknight	fglrxinfo and glxinfo show i have the drivers loaded
2007-01-05T09:44:00.000Z	klees	xtknight	not using xgl
2007-01-05T09:44:00.000Z	xtknight	klees	is glxinfo fast?
2007-01-05T09:44:00.000Z	xtknight	klees	err, glxgears
2007-01-05T09:45:00.000Z	klees	xtknight	the gl screensavers are no longer accelerated after the latest updates.  everything was fine prior
2007-01-05T09:45:00.000Z	klees	xtknight	yes
2007-01-05T09:45:00.000Z	xtknight	klees	hmm i'm not sure why that would be
2007-01-05T09:45:00.000Z	klees	xtknight	im not sure what broke what in the latest set of updates
2007-01-05T09:46:00.000Z	xtknight	klees	run a screensaver manually from /usr/lib/xscreensaver/gl*...    same thing?
2007-01-05T09:47:00.000Z	klees	xtknight	running it manually looks fine
2007-01-05T09:48:00.000Z	xtknight	klees	what happens if you just preview a screensaver?  does it work then also?
2007-01-05T09:48:00.000Z	xtknight	klees	(in the gnome screensaver preferences dialog)
2007-01-05T09:49:00.000Z	klees	xtknight	preview shows the screensaver not accelrated
2007-01-05T09:49:00.000Z	klees	xtknight	the same screensaver i ran manually
2007-01-05T09:49:00.000Z	xtknight	klees	ok, a screensaver service is to blame.  im not sure which one X or gnome uses,  xscreensaver maybe or something like that, i know there's osme service
2007-01-05T09:50:00.000Z	klees	xtknight	i know nothing about those services
2007-01-05T09:50:00.000Z	xtknight	klees	me neither, unfortunately ;)
2007-01-05T09:51:00.000Z	klees	xtknight	do u have an ATI card?
2007-01-05T09:51:00.000Z	xtknight	klees	naw, nvidia
