2012-09-27T17:01:00.000Z	VlanX	MonkeyDust	thanks=)
2012-09-27T20:42:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	VlanX	 | tee blah stores to a file named blah
2012-09-27T20:42:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	VlanX	 that is a pipe and then tee blah
2012-09-27T20:51:00.000Z	VlanX	MonkeyDust	sorry do you mean  expect | tee file.text  ?
2012-09-27T20:52:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	VlanX	 i'm not familiar with expect, but i do know you can pipe any outcome to a file, using the command tee
2012-09-27T20:52:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	VlanX	 [some very long and complex command] | tee blah
2012-09-27T20:56:00.000Z	VlanX	MonkeyDust	even the outcome of an ssh session from a remote machine?
2012-09-27T20:56:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	VlanX	 try it, i'll try too
2012-09-27T20:59:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	VlanX	 tried it, didn't work over ssh
2012-09-27T21:00:00.000Z	VlanX	MonkeyDust	yeah... so is there any chance even changing interpreter?
2012-09-27T21:00:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	VlanX	 forget what i said
2012-09-27T21:00:00.000Z	VlanX	MonkeyDust	you can actually?
2012-09-27T21:00:00.000Z	VlanX	MonkeyDust	it returns an error here
2012-09-27T21:00:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	VlanX	 no, but my remote pc has debian, no tee there
2012-09-27T21:01:00.000Z	VlanX	MonkeyDust	oh wait, you mean the remote host must have tee right?
2012-09-27T21:02:00.000Z	VlanX	MonkeyDust	it's a cisco so it should have it
2012-09-27T21:03:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	VlanX	 try    ls | tee username@192.......:/home/username/blah    (change where needed)
2012-09-27T21:04:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	VlanX	 use 'ls' to test the syntax
2012-09-27T21:06:00.000Z	VlanX	MonkeyDust	i think i did it, you've been very helpful thanks again :)
2012-09-27T21:10:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	VlanX	 how did you d o it?
