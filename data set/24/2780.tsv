2008-11-11T17:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	kleftisx	sudo apt-get --purge remove amsn; sudo apt-get clean; sudo apt-get install amsn
2008-11-11T17:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	kleftisx	unless you compiled it, in which case it will need recompiling differently
2008-11-11T17:43:00.000Z	kleftisx	ActionParsnip1	i have try the method you told me, but nothing changes. I get the same error again.
2008-11-11T17:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	kleftisx	is there a ~/.amsn directory?
2008-11-11T17:45:00.000Z	kleftisx	ActionParsnip1	yes there is ~/.amsn directory. at home/username/.amsn/
2008-11-11T17:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	kleftisx	rename that folder and rerun, see if it helps. rename it back if it doesnt work
2008-11-11T17:50:00.000Z	kleftisx	ActionParsnip1	same again. the same error.
2008-11-11T17:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	kleftisx	ok delete the newly created ~/.ams folder and rename the old one back so you are where you started again
2008-11-11T17:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	kleftisx	maybe theres a newer version released than is on your repos
2008-11-11T17:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	kleftisx	check the amsn site
2008-11-11T18:04:00.000Z	kleftisx	ActionParsnip1	is the latest version, but i cannot still open it!
2008-11-11T18:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	kleftisx	whats the error again?

2008-11-11T18:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	kleftisx	easier solution is to edit the first line of the 'amsn' script and change 'wish' by 'wish8.5' or 'wish8.4' depending on which version you are using.
