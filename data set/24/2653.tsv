2009-01-30T20:54:00.000Z	goran__		hi guys, i just installed new nvidia driverse (180.11) and i'm experiencing some color loss
2009-01-30T20:54:00.000Z	goran__		for example, i can see stripes on my background etc...
2009-01-30T20:54:00.000Z	goran__		does anyone know what could be the problem?
2009-01-30T20:54:00.000Z	vock	goran__	 are you sure that the new drivers support your videocard?
2009-01-30T20:55:00.000Z	goran__		yes.. i have 3d acceleration
2009-01-30T20:55:00.000Z	goran__		it's like 16bit colors
2009-01-30T20:55:00.000Z	vock	goran__	 yes, but as far as i understand, the nvidia drivers only support a certain list of nvidia video cards, need to make sure the card you have is on the list of the 180 drivers
2009-01-30T20:56:00.000Z	vock	goran__	what type of video card do you have?
2009-01-30T20:56:00.000Z	goran__		geforce go 7300
2009-01-30T20:57:00.000Z	goran__	vock	so where can i find that list?
2009-01-30T20:58:00.000Z	vock	goran__	i'm trying to find the right website, are you running hardy or intrepid?
2009-01-30T20:58:00.000Z	goran__		intrepid
2009-01-30T20:59:00.000Z	vock	goran__	check out http://packages.ubuntu.com/intrepid-updates/nvidia-glx-180
2009-01-30T21:00:00.000Z	vock	goran__	and see if it's on the list
2009-01-30T21:00:00.000Z	goran__		just a sec
2009-01-30T21:00:00.000Z	goran__	vock	yep it is supported
2009-01-30T21:01:00.000Z	vock	goran__	do you have nvidia-settings installed?
2009-01-30T21:01:00.000Z	goran__		i thought that this could be compiz-fusion problem but it is still there when i switch to metacity
2009-01-30T21:01:00.000Z	goran__	vock	yes i have
2009-01-30T21:01:00.000Z	vock	goran__	and when you run it, it doesn't give an error, and correctly states the driver?
2009-01-30T21:02:00.000Z	goran__		noup.. seems that everything is working fine
2009-01-30T21:02:00.000Z	goran__	vock	i can post you Xorg.0.log if you want
2009-01-30T21:03:00.000Z	vock	goran__	maybe you're right and it could be compiz, i'm not really that sure, have you tried switching back to metacity to see if there is still the same problem? (metacity --replace), i'm guessing you did seeing how you can see what we're typing
2009-01-30T21:03:00.000Z	vock	goran__	in all honesty i'm not that good, i think you're problem is more than i know how to fix, sorry
