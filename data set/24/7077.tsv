2005-04-29T07:25:00.000Z	Fab2	jc	do you use the correct driver?
2005-04-29T07:25:00.000Z	jc		yup
2005-04-29T07:25:00.000Z	Fab2	jc	then edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2005-04-29T07:26:00.000Z	Fab2		and add "800x600" or "1024x768" before the other values for every display mode
2005-04-29T07:26:00.000Z	jc		i tried but it still doesnt work
2005-04-29T07:26:00.000Z	Fab2	jc	did you restart X ?

2005-04-29T07:27:00.000Z	Fab2	jc	if not, logout, at the login screen press ctrl+alt+del, login again (the screen is supposed to go black for short)
2005-04-29T07:27:00.000Z	jc	Fab2	yup
2005-04-29T07:27:00.000Z	Fab2	jc	hmm
