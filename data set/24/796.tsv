2012-06-08T06:35:00.000Z	Darkenvy		Okay, pretend I have ubuntu 11. What repo has MySQL in it?
2012-06-08T06:35:00.000Z	sacarlson	Darkenvy	I think that's a end of life version of ubuntu
2012-06-08T06:36:00.000Z	sacarlson	Darkenvy	they all have mysql in them but they will be compiled on different libs
2012-06-08T06:37:00.000Z	sacarlson	Darkenvy	you can just upgrade and import your mysql files into a new version
2012-06-08T06:38:00.000Z	sacarlson	Darkenvy	ya I hate to upgrade too, I still run 10.04 because of it
2012-06-08T06:39:00.000Z	sacarlson	Darkenvy	if you never want to upgrade then you at least need to make a recoverable backup
2012-06-08T06:42:00.000Z	sacarlson	Darkenvy	ya I was hacked with old version of oscomerce because there was a big whole that bots look for
2012-06-08T08:54:00.000Z	sacarlson	Darkenvy	there are a few options for java I would go for the real oricle one
2012-06-08T08:59:00.000Z	sacarlson	Darkenvy	orical purchased sun, not sure if that made any difference
2012-06-09T07:07:00.000Z	sacarlson	Darkenvy	that last link looks fine, didn't it work?
2012-06-09T07:08:00.000Z	sacarlson	Darkenvy	http://christiansons.net/mike/blog/2012/03/oracle-java-7-on-ubuntu-11-10-12-04/
2012-06-09T07:08:00.000Z	sacarlson	Darkenvy	unless you want java6 that I think most people use
2012-06-09T07:09:00.000Z	sacarlson	Darkenvy	did you use sudo?
2012-06-09T07:09:00.000Z	Darkenvy	sacarlson	yes I did use sudo
2012-06-09T07:10:00.000Z	sacarlson	Darkenvy	show me the command line that didn't work?
2012-06-09T07:12:00.000Z	sacarlson	Darkenvy	I just did sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java  and it worked fine so what did you type?
2012-06-09T07:13:00.000Z	sacarlson	Darkenvy	see if you read the simple instructions it does work
2012-06-09T07:15:00.000Z	Darkenvy	sacarlson	the snide comments are not nessisary. I am bombarded by a littany of methods to install java. all complicated, all various version and all from various dates dating back to 2008
2012-06-09T07:21:00.000Z	sacarlson	Darkenvy	I'm not sure why but I can't read your pastebin.com with message his website/URL has been blocked until further notice either pursuant to Court orders
