2009-08-19T11:42:00.000Z	myownserver		I've got a few questions regarding the purpose of DNS Servers.
2009-08-19T11:42:00.000Z	toupeiro	myownserver	DNS servers correlate IP addresses and qualified names and/or aliases
2009-08-19T11:43:00.000Z	myownserver	toupeiro	I know how they work and function, my question is how does having my own benefit me and what are it's potential uses?
2009-08-19T11:44:00.000Z	toupeiro	myownserver	 That would depend on how many hosts you work with.  So, hosting your own DNS would allow you to hit all of your network resources by name, regardless of IP address if using DHCP
2009-08-19T11:45:00.000Z	toupeiro	myownserver	alternatively, you can use local hostfiles to do the same thing, but its definitely a more hands on approach
2009-08-19T11:46:00.000Z	toupeiro	myownserver	I agree
2009-08-19T11:46:00.000Z	toupeiro	myownserver	openDNS.org is what I use
2009-08-19T11:48:00.000Z	toupeiro	myownserver	yes, it for that use case, I would use your own.  If you don't I would seriously consider using a static IP and port forwarding
2009-08-19T11:51:00.000Z	myownserver	toupeiro	Static IP's cost a lot here and for a personal web server, it's not practical since it's not making me money
2009-08-19T11:51:00.000Z	toupeiro	myownserver	 Do you have a policy in place that would prevent you from putting it on a private network with port forwarding?
2009-08-19T11:52:00.000Z	myownserver	toupeiro	No, there's nothing preventing that.
2009-08-19T11:53:00.000Z	toupeiro	myownserver	 Thats basically what I do to hit my webserver.  I hit the IP address associated with my router, and I have apache listening on a specific TCP port, so the url for me is tailed with :<port_number>
2009-08-19T11:58:00.000Z	toupeiro	myownserver	 DNS provides name resolution.  thats its big purpose.  So you can type things by name rather than having to memorize ip addresses.
2009-08-19T11:59:00.000Z	toupeiro	myownserver	DynamicDNS is DNS that allows automatic record updates, usually by a DHCP server
2009-08-19T12:02:00.000Z	toupeiro	myownserver	A LAN stands for local area network, which revers to more than one machine configured to talk to one another.  Lan's are generally reserved to small locations or buildings, subnets, or single switches.
2009-08-19T12:03:00.000Z	toupeiro	myownserver	DNS can do that for you, yes
2009-08-19T12:04:00.000Z	toupeiro	myownserver	 DNS is not alltogether complicated.  there are plenty of howto's on how to do it which you can find on google, and how to restrict DNS
