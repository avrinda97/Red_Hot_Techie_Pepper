2005-04-24T08:33:00.000Z	Null	devscott	I did lsmod, but no PCMCIA shows up
2005-04-24T08:34:00.000Z	devscott	Null	from the command line do a   sudo /etc/init.d/pcmica restart
2005-04-24T08:35:00.000Z	Null	devscott	it says pcmcia not present
2005-04-24T08:39:00.000Z	Null	devscott	it says pcmcia not present

2005-04-24T08:47:00.000Z	devscott	Null	do you get a sound when you plug in the card
2005-04-24T08:47:00.000Z	Null	devscott	no, because my sound doesn't work either
2005-04-24T08:48:00.000Z	devscott	Null	this would be a system speaker beep

2005-04-24T08:55:00.000Z	devscott	Null	no problem. happy hacking
2005-04-24T09:02:00.000Z	Null	devscott	that bug link you sent me keeps referring to /etc/modules/ but that folder doesn't even exist, is that a problem?
2005-04-24T09:17:00.000Z	Null	devscott	well I got the pcmcia_core and i82365 modules to load, but now it doesn't recognize the network card
2005-04-24T09:20:00.000Z	Null	devscott	and in ifconfig eth0 doesn't show up
