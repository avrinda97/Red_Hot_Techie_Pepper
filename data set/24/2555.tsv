2008-11-08T18:14:00.000Z	Stoneheart		so far this one likes it
2008-11-08T18:14:00.000Z	Stoneheart		I am running 3 seperate opsys on it from 3 seperate drives
2008-11-08T18:14:00.000Z	Stoneheart		yes sir
2008-11-08T18:14:00.000Z	Stoneheart		still working it
2008-11-08T18:15:00.000Z	Stoneheart		just need that break
2008-11-08T18:16:00.000Z	Stoneheart		I would love to find some really good at this I have about 60 computers in a school to convert and a server to setup
2008-11-08T18:17:00.000Z	Stoneheart		No I love a challenge and will get it done over time
2008-11-08T18:17:00.000Z	Stoneheart		Yes but this school is poor.
2008-11-08T18:18:00.000Z	Stoneheart		So I am learning quickly
2008-11-08T18:18:00.000Z	Stoneheart		Microsoft wants about 50000usd to get them upgraded
2008-11-08T18:18:00.000Z	Mechdave	Stoneheart	why don't you do a server install and then do a network install to each pc
2008-11-08T18:19:00.000Z	Stoneheart		With ubuntu it will be free
2008-11-08T18:19:00.000Z	Stoneheart		that is with the reductions
2008-11-08T18:19:00.000Z	Mechdave	Stoneheart	Or maybe do a kickstart config so you can install many machines the same
2008-11-08T18:20:00.000Z	Stoneheart		Yes problem is the hardware it older p4 1.8 512 ram 20 gig hd's
2008-11-08T18:20:00.000Z	Stoneheart		most are p3 with 256 ram 20 gig hd's
2008-11-08T18:21:00.000Z	Stoneheart		I am going to be learning big time over the next few months
2008-11-08T18:22:00.000Z	Mechdave	Stoneheart	personally I would get the alternative ubuntu install, burn off about 10 disks and do a OEM install on 10 machines at a time
2008-11-08T18:23:00.000Z	Stoneheart		that is what I was planning
2008-11-08T18:24:00.000Z	Mechdave	Stoneheart	it will be the simplest way to go about it.
2008-11-08T18:24:00.000Z	Stoneheart	Mechdave	my problem is net working.   I need to make sure I can still use some windows prog thru wine.
2008-11-08T18:24:00.000Z	Mechdave	Stoneheart	what programs do you need to use?
2008-11-08T18:25:00.000Z	Stoneheart		Not sure Some educational stuff not offered on the bunt side yet.  This school is pre-k thru high school
2008-11-08T18:26:00.000Z	Mechdave	Stoneheart	maybe do 1 computer and install wine and then experiment with your software first, and also check with the appDB too
