2007-09-29T14:07:00.000Z	shiznit		hello
2007-09-29T14:08:00.000Z	shiznit		should i install x86 even though i can run x64?
2007-09-29T14:08:00.000Z	MrPrimate	shiznit	install x86 if you are really newbie and you don't need x64 for anything, it will be less headaches for simplicity
2007-09-29T14:09:00.000Z	shiznit	MrPrimate	will all 4gb of ram work?
2007-09-29T14:10:00.000Z	MrPrimate	shiznit	yup
2007-09-29T14:40:00.000Z	shiznit	MrPrimate	what about 4gb ram + video ram?
2007-09-29T14:40:00.000Z	MrPrimate	shiznit	what about it ?
2007-09-29T14:41:00.000Z	shiznit	MrPrimate	in windows x86 you can only have 4gb total ram, so my 768mg video ram is subtracted from the 4gb system ram and the OS can only see 3.2gb.  Will i have the same problem in ubuntu?
2007-09-29T14:49:00.000Z	MrPrimate	shiznit	yes, is possible setup
2007-09-29T14:49:00.000Z	MrPrimate	shiznit	in many configurations
2007-09-29T14:49:00.000Z	shiznit	MrPrimate	any clue how to get my nvidia to work?
2007-09-29T14:49:00.000Z	MrPrimate	shiznit	you can set them up to stretch the desktop, have one scroll to the size of the other, put them next to each other, as seperate workspaces, have one in text mode, anything you can think of
2007-09-29T14:49:00.000Z	MrPrimate	shiznit	did you install commercial nvidia driver?  is it listed in xorg.conf ?
2007-09-29T14:50:00.000Z	shiznit	MrPrimate	i had to set the livecd to vga mode to install it because it booted to black scree
2007-09-29T14:51:00.000Z	shiznit	MrPrimate	after i installed it still booted to black, so i read the forums, apt-got the nvidia stuff, recofigured xserver as some people said and still nothing
2007-09-29T14:52:00.000Z	MrPrimate	shiznit	if you just want it to work regardless of slowness for now, use the vesa driver
2007-09-29T14:52:00.000Z	MrPrimate	shiznit	choosing the vesa driver will most likely boot into X, but is probably slow
2007-09-29T14:52:00.000Z	MrPrimate	shiznit	later you can try the nvidia driver or the free version
2007-09-29T14:53:00.000Z	shiznit	MrPrimate	yes that works but it kinda sucks, my 24'' widescreen crt is running 1280x1028@76hz, kinda shitty and hurts my eyes
2007-09-29T14:53:00.000Z	shiznit	MrPrimate	i have tried the apt-get nvidia-glx-new driver and still nothing
2007-09-29T14:53:00.000Z	MrPrimate	shiznit	so your options are to try the different drivers available for nvidia cards --

2007-09-29T14:54:00.000Z	MrPrimate	shiznit	if you want to blame anyone, blame nvidia for not making proper drivers for linux
2007-09-29T14:55:00.000Z	MrPrimate	shiznit	did you try the 'nv' free driver ?
