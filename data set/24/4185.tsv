2007-07-13T11:43:00.000Z	Zack		Could somebody please tell me what i am doing wrong on installing adobe flash player!?
2007-07-13T11:43:00.000Z	shiester_miester	Zack	yeah but then you lose the compositing :P
2007-07-13T11:49:00.000Z	shiester_miester	Zack	if the user has permission, then EVERY SINGLE program on the computer has permission, which would be very very bad :P
2007-07-13T12:07:00.000Z	shiester_miester	Zack	www.scion.com seems to load up to 80% and then stop :/
2007-07-13T12:08:00.000Z	shiester_miester	Zack	this is such a crappy website that i cant even begin to describe how crappy it is
2007-07-13T12:08:00.000Z	shiester_miester	Zack	yeah, except that all the content is in flash...
2007-07-13T12:09:00.000Z	shiester_miester	Zack	which completely eliminates all benefit you get from using the latest standards
2007-07-13T12:09:00.000Z	shiester_miester	Zack	and also, they are missing an <XML> tag from the start :P
2007-07-13T12:09:00.000Z	shiester_miester	Zack	what a pile of crap...its in FLASH
2007-07-13T12:10:00.000Z	shiester_miester	Zack	obviously its not very good at all since it doesnt appear to work in ubuntu / firefox
2007-07-13T12:10:00.000Z	shiester_miester	Zack	on the other hand, my own website works in everything, so therefore it must be better than theirs :P
2007-07-13T12:11:00.000Z	shiester_miester	Zack	a real web developer is not content with his site working in "MOST" browsers...it should work in EVERYTHING
2007-07-13T12:12:00.000Z	shiester_miester	Zack	it opens fine in internet explorer in ubuntu
2007-07-13T12:12:00.000Z	shiester_miester	Zack	oh wait...apparently not
2007-07-13T12:12:00.000Z	shiester_miester	Zack	well, looks like it doesnt work in ubuntu at all
2007-07-13T12:12:00.000Z	Zack	shiester_miester	ah! seriously!
2007-07-13T12:13:00.000Z	shiester_miester	Zack	yeah, i tried IE and it does the same thing
2007-07-13T12:13:00.000Z	Zack	shiester_miester	what could we/ubuntu be missing?...... theres something that we dont have that IE has.
2007-07-13T12:14:00.000Z	shiester_miester	Zack	its not our fault, its their own fault for making a non-compatible website
2007-07-13T12:15:00.000Z	Zack	shiester_miester	but we should be able to adapt well enough to take in those screw ups just as Windows and Mac does.
2007-07-13T12:15:00.000Z	shiester_miester	Zack	the problem is that they are designed FOR windows, since its the most popular, so you won't see any problems if you just use IE in windows since the whole web is pretty much made for it
2007-07-13T12:17:00.000Z	shiester_miester	Zack	yes!  it pisses me off daily, as a web developer, having to design for IE
2007-07-13T12:21:00.000Z	Zack	shiester_miester	ill show you what he means, system>preferences>sessions> new
2007-07-13T12:24:00.000Z	shiester_miester	Zack	well you figure out what it is from a shortcut, usually
