2009-06-28T20:41:00.000Z	ikonia	Incarus	you can't do that
2009-06-28T20:42:00.000Z	ikonia	Incarus	the dependencies will not match
2009-06-28T20:42:00.000Z	Incarus	ikonia	i can, but packages. ubuntu.com is down
2009-06-28T20:42:00.000Z	ikonia	Incarus	your dependencies will break
2009-06-28T20:42:00.000Z	Incarus	ikonia	it depends on what you will download
2009-07-05T17:00:00.000Z	Incarus	ikonia	he could try another name server
2009-07-05T17:01:00.000Z	ikonia	Incarus	how do you know his current is not working ?
2009-07-05T17:03:00.000Z	Incarus	ikonia	he tried google on eth0, and got 2% packet loss
2009-07-05T17:03:00.000Z	ikonia	Incarus	so ?
2009-07-05T17:03:00.000Z	Incarus	ikonia	i think so
2009-07-05T17:03:00.000Z	ikonia	Incarus	you think so what ?
2009-07-05T17:03:00.000Z	Incarus	ikonia	eth0 (wired) -> ping google -> 2% packet loss
2009-07-05T17:03:00.000Z	ikonia	Incarus	so ?
2009-07-05T17:04:00.000Z	Incarus	ikonia	lol, i dont know, i think so
2009-07-05T17:04:00.000Z	ikonia	Incarus	you think so what ?
2009-07-05T17:04:00.000Z	ikonia	Incarus	what is your point ?
2009-07-05T17:04:00.000Z	Incarus	ikonia	if he got 2% packet loss in an wired connection, the problem isnt the wireless card
2009-07-05T17:04:00.000Z	ikonia	Incarus	don't be silly - he had no resolution under wireless, %2 packet loss is not uncommon
2009-07-05T17:05:00.000Z	Incarus	ikonia	k
2009-07-05T17:05:00.000Z	ikonia	Incarus	the internet / ISP is big a small ammount of packet loss is not unheard of
2009-07-05T17:05:00.000Z	Incarus	ikonia	i dont really have packet loss in germany
2009-07-05T17:06:00.000Z	ikonia	Incarus	again, what is your point ?
2009-07-05T17:07:00.000Z	Incarus	ikonia	forget it
2009-07-21T21:39:00.000Z	Incarus	ikonia	kick
