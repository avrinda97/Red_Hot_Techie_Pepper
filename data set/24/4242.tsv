2007-08-02T08:20:00.000Z	Falstius	garette	plug in the drive then run 'dmesg | tail' in a terminal, it should tell you if there is an error with the drive or how it was assigned.

2007-08-02T08:23:00.000Z	Falstius		when you install gnome, did you do it with apt-get intall ubuntu-desktop  ?
2007-08-02T08:23:00.000Z	garette		plz temme what i have to add in fstab so that when  i insert a cdrom it automatically gets mountedanyone
2007-08-02T08:23:00.000Z	garette	Falstius	thanks
2007-08-02T08:24:00.000Z	garette		Falstius,hey
2007-08-02T08:24:00.000Z	garette		Falstius,when i insert the pen drive while using kde it automatically gets detected
2007-08-02T08:24:00.000Z	Falstius	garette	I saw that.  I asked how you installed gnome.
2007-08-02T08:25:00.000Z	garette		Falstius,i installed ubuntu fiesty from the install dvd, i got gnome for default
2007-08-02T08:25:00.000Z	garette	Falstius	and then i installed kde :)
2007-08-02T08:26:00.000Z	Falstius	garette	possibly installing kde broke gnome.  I can't tell you how to fix it.
2007-08-02T08:26:00.000Z	garette		Falstius,lol
2007-08-02T08:26:00.000Z	garette		Falstius,how could that happen?
2007-08-02T08:27:00.000Z	Falstius	garette	gnome uses HAL to automount devices.  I don't know what kde uses, they may be incompatible.
2007-08-02T08:28:00.000Z	garette		Falstius,hey do you know about what gnome is providing in default for "desktop effects"??i guess compiz is it so?
2007-08-02T08:30:00.000Z	Falstius	garette	for feisty if you install desktop effects it is compiz.  Beryl can be installed to (I ran it until I went dual monitor)
2007-08-02T08:31:00.000Z	garette	Falstius	plz tell how do i add extra workspace
2007-08-02T08:32:00.000Z	garette		Falstius,i have got nvidia 7600 graphics card with 256mb graphic memory so am running compiz very successfully .. enjoying linux :)
2007-08-02T08:32:00.000Z	Falstius	garette	right click on the workspace swticher, chose preferences
