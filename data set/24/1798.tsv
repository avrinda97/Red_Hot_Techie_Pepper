2009-10-09T07:38:00.000Z	heater	Xcell	how do i uninstall graphics
2009-10-09T07:38:00.000Z	heater	Xcell	as of now i only have the driver that is from the package manager
2009-10-09T07:40:00.000Z	heater	Xcell	last time i tried this, when i was installing, when i reboot i have to boot into safe graphics mode and there are many errors
2009-10-09T07:42:00.000Z	heater	Xcell	ok i will give it a shot, is there a way to reverse if things go wrong?
2009-10-09T07:52:00.000Z	heater	Xcell	you are a genius, thank you so much
2009-10-09T07:52:00.000Z	heater	Xcell	are you good with sound?
2009-10-09T07:52:00.000Z	heater	Xcell	yea i did it works wonderfully, now XBMC doesn't stutter with HD playback
2009-10-09T07:53:00.000Z	heater	Xcell	i had sound 2 days ago, and now i don't. aplay -l says "no sound cards" and under volume control it says: playback Null output
2009-10-09T07:57:00.000Z	heater	Xcell	all are ALSA except for "Default Mixer Tracks"
2009-10-09T07:57:00.000Z	heater	Xcell	That is Pulseaudio(but neither word) i have tried using the test button on all of the different options
2009-10-09T07:59:00.000Z	heater	Xcell	it can't see my sound cards at all anymore so i believe the drivers are there but the hardware is not being seen to be used with them
2009-10-09T08:00:00.000Z	heater	Xcell	i was afraid of that...ill see what i can come up with. thanks for all you help :)
