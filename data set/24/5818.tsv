2006-04-21T13:55:00.000Z	Warbo		768MB? I have 350 odd
2006-04-21T13:55:00.000Z	Warbo		But 5GB swap
2006-04-21T13:56:00.000Z	Warbo		Because when I build live CDs I need 2 copies of the uncompressed image in the RAM, or it fails
2006-04-21T13:56:00.000Z	Warbo		And when using 7zip that is a BIG waste of time
2006-04-21T13:56:00.000Z	Warbo		so much time that I have to use spatial adjectives to describe it
2006-04-21T13:56:00.000Z	Warbo		partition
2006-04-21T13:57:00.000Z	Warbo		I know I could use less swap and make a file when needed
2006-04-21T13:57:00.000Z	Warbo		swap file
2006-04-21T13:58:00.000Z	Warbo		are they? Didn't know. (I'm assuming that's compared to partitions, not RAM which is obvious)
2006-04-21T13:58:00.000Z	immolo	Warbo	it has to open the file, find where it was last writing, write, close and start again
2006-04-21T13:59:00.000Z	immolo	Warbo	on an already busy partition
2006-04-21T13:59:00.000Z	Warbo	immolo	I know people say "run sync loads of times when making swap files"
2006-04-21T13:59:00.000Z	immolo	Warbo	Never heard of using that with swap files
2006-04-21T14:00:00.000Z	Warbo	immolo	Just to keep the swap fil together
2006-04-21T14:01:00.000Z	immolo	Warbo	well I'll keep to my swap partition , swap files sound even worse now :P
2006-04-21T14:02:00.000Z	Warbo	immolo	I'm not trying to convert you I use partitions
2006-04-21T14:03:00.000Z	immolo	Warbo	I know, but you put me off even more just the same
2006-04-21T14:03:00.000Z	immolo	Warbo	not true, some apps need it
2006-05-01T07:11:00.000Z	immolo	Warbo	you are trying to say a hole that has been known about for years was just found a few weeks before msblast
2006-05-01T07:12:00.000Z	Warbo	immolo	I don't know. Just that he made msblast (actually msblast-b, because a variant was found first) and released the source on Yahoo!. The police have dealt with him though
2006-05-01T07:13:00.000Z	immolo	Warbo	you could be right I'm thinking of code red
2006-05-02T12:08:00.000Z	immolo	Warbo	can't you just install a 32bit binary of firefox and flash like other distros
2006-05-02T12:10:00.000Z	Warbo	immolo	I haven't used a 64bit system myself (except my mates, but it was 32bit XP :)) but I think that chroot is the best way. Also, if you're going to install different versions of Firefox you may as well use windoze version and get Flash 8 (in WINE)
2006-05-02T12:11:00.000Z	immolo	Warbo	well I've only tried once because live is so much better flash free but with gentoo I can have my 64bit mplayer, firefix etc and my 32bit versions can be called by adding -bin to the end of the program
