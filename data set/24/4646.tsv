2008-01-05T15:38:00.000Z	ehc	mkquist	did you try using the web developer addon to highlight anything? that is the main thing that I need. I want to highlight the different sections of a website to show the tables that it is using.

2008-01-05T15:40:00.000Z	ehc	mkquist	i want to take a long (as in you need to scroll through the page to show all of the content) webpage and save it as an image.
2008-01-05T15:42:00.000Z	mkquist	ehc	well u can save it as multiple images if that helps, u still get the whole page in one swipe of a d/l tho
2008-01-05T15:42:00.000Z	mkquist	ehc	maybe join the images in gimp?
2008-01-05T15:42:00.000Z	mkquist	ehc	or are u looking for code?
