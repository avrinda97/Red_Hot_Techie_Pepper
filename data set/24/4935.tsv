2006-12-09T06:05:00.000Z	umgan		could someone help me out w/ an icon/partition problem?
2006-12-09T06:06:00.000Z	umgan		i know u all are busy
2006-12-09T06:07:00.000Z	umgan		i unmounted a drive in ntfs...used gparted to format it to ext3.  with the help of a friend i got the drive remounted and i can access it with the file system.  However, the drive no longer shows on my desktop or in places --> computer
2006-12-09T06:08:00.000Z	pluma	umgan	did you check your fstab?
2006-12-09T06:09:00.000Z	umgan	pluma	the NEW uuid is unknown so we replaced it with /media/hda1 and it works i'm not sure how else to edit the fstab to make the icon show
2006-12-09T06:10:00.000Z	pluma	umgan	if in doubt, remove the NTFS drive from /etc/fstab if it's in there and replace it with the correct ext3 partition's instructions. Then unmount it and remount it in the GNOME disk manager
2006-12-09T06:10:00.000Z	pluma	umgan	At least that's how I fixed a similar problem last week ^^
2006-12-09T06:10:00.000Z	umgan	pluma	ok i did the first part of that...thats how we got it working....but let me try that second part
2006-12-09T06:11:00.000Z	umgan	pluma	can i use pysdm to unmount and remount?
2006-12-09T06:12:00.000Z	pluma	umgan	Actually, I just rebooted, but I guess unmounting should work too.
2006-12-09T06:12:00.000Z	umgan	pluma	hmm no change...i also tried rebooting earlier
2006-12-09T06:13:00.000Z	umgan	pluma	the drive works fine itsjust that theres no icon
2006-12-09T06:13:00.000Z	pluma	umgan	Hm... odd. Does it appear properly in the GNOME disk info stuffs (disk admin, space monitor in System Monitor)?
2006-12-09T06:14:00.000Z	pluma		s/space monitor/devices tab/
2006-12-09T06:15:00.000Z	umgan	pluma	it shows up in system monitor file systems tab...if thats not what u mean i'ms till a bit of a nub ><
2006-12-09T06:16:00.000Z	pluma	umgan	I mean the GUI based programs. Menu->System->Administration->Disks for example
2006-12-09T06:16:00.000Z	umgan		hmm i dont have one called disks
2006-12-09T06:16:00.000Z	umgan	pluma	hmm i dont have one called disks
2006-12-09T06:17:00.000Z	umgan	pluma	however it shows up on pydsm jsut fine
2006-12-09T06:17:00.000Z	pluma	umgan	try gksu disks-admin
2006-12-09T06:18:00.000Z	pluma	umgan	Hm... no idea then. I'm not much of an expert myself either.
2006-12-09T06:19:00.000Z	umgan	pluma	hmm well thanks anyways :)
