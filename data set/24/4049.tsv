2008-06-22T04:45:00.000Z	shaba1		Hello
2008-06-22T04:46:00.000Z	shaba1		what is teh linux eqivalent of ctrl-alt-delete to stop a stuck program
2008-06-22T04:46:00.000Z	vocx	shaba1	programs do not get stuck, you can use the system monitor to kill running processes, or from the terminal "pkill <something>"
2008-06-22T04:47:00.000Z	vocx	shaba1	there are various ways to kill something, "kill <number>", "pkill <name>", "xkill" use the mouse to kill a window
2008-06-22T04:50:00.000Z	vocx	shaba1	open a terminal the do "xkill"  and click on firefox
2008-06-22T04:54:00.000Z	vocx	shaba1	that's a kill, a ctrl+alt+delete
2008-06-22T05:10:00.000Z	vocx	shaba1	you probably killed the panels too. But no worry.
2008-06-22T05:10:00.000Z	vocx	shaba1	type "gnome-panel" in the terminal
2008-06-22T05:11:00.000Z	vocx	shaba1	right, you have no terminal, type Alt-F2 then "gnome-panel" install from there.
2008-06-22T05:12:00.000Z	vocx	shaba1	there must be a gnome-panel, I'm confused, you rebooted or what?
2008-06-22T05:13:00.000Z	vocx	shaba1	reboot, it solves things!
2008-06-22T05:14:00.000Z	vocx	shaba1	in fact just restar X, with Ctrl-Alt-Backspace
2008-06-22T05:14:00.000Z	vocx	shaba1	okay don't reboot, but what else, are you running compiz
2008-06-22T05:19:00.000Z	vocx	shaba1	go ahead insult me
2008-06-22T05:19:00.000Z	vocx	shaba1	I usually assume nothing, it's just that most questions are too vague and not very clear. So we have to keep guessing.
2008-06-22T05:21:00.000Z	vocx	shaba1	I actually told you not to reboot, but you left the channel exactly then.
2008-06-22T05:24:00.000Z	vocx	shaba1	I did, but you left the channel then, I mean I wanted to clarify... sorry mate. But it was a great experience for you wasn't it?
2008-06-22T05:25:00.000Z	vocx	shaba1	linux is fun, welcome!
2008-06-22T05:27:00.000Z	vocx	shaba1	no problem I like them harsh.. you a girl right?   sorry bad joke
2008-06-22T05:30:00.000Z	vocx	shaba1	the panels are back at least?
2008-06-22T05:32:00.000Z	vocx	shaba1	workspaces, like multiple desktops, add them again, select a panel
2008-06-22T05:33:00.000Z	vocx	shaba1	very useful to have 4 workspaces or as many as you want
2008-06-22T05:37:00.000Z	vocx	shaba1	the power of workspaces
2008-06-22T05:52:00.000Z	vocx	shaba1	read the logs for X, or use "lspci", or "dmesg" or read the file "/etc/X11/xorg.conf"  actually there are many ways to get the information on what driver you are using. Maybe there is already some pretty GUI in the System menu that will show this.
