2009-01-27T07:09:00.000Z	laeg	alcane	yes, this is how i know it keeps a terminal open :)
2009-01-27T07:01:00.000Z	alcane	laeg	right click and make a launcher
2009-01-27T07:02:00.000Z	laeg	alcane	the right click drop down menu doesn't give me that option
2009-01-27T07:02:00.000Z	alcane	laeg	place it on your desktop and then try to pull it over
2009-01-27T07:03:00.000Z	laeg	alcane	the shell script? won't moving it to the desktop mess things up?
2009-01-27T07:03:00.000Z	alcane	laeg	are you just trying to create a shortcut?
2009-01-27T07:04:00.000Z	laeg	alcane	i want the launcher in applications > internet
2009-01-27T07:04:00.000Z	laeg	alcane	but when i try the one i've made i get "Failed to execute child process "opt/vuze/./azureus" (No such file or directory"
2009-01-27T07:05:00.000Z	alcane	laeg	you made it on your desktop and it won't even work there? or was that after you tried to move it?
2009-01-27T07:05:00.000Z	laeg	alcane	i didn't make anything on my desktop...
2009-01-27T07:06:00.000Z	laeg	alcane	azureus is installed and working in /opt/vuze but they only way i've so far been able to launch it is through terminal opt/vuze/./azureus which keeps the terminal window open
2009-01-27T07:08:00.000Z	alcane	laeg	create a launcher and make sure it works on your desktop
2009-01-27T07:08:00.000Z	alcane	laeg	does that keep a terminal open?
2009-01-27T07:10:00.000Z	alcane	laeg	are you selecting the "Run in Terminal" option?
2009-01-27T07:10:00.000Z	alcane	laeg	ok, you're creating a launcher, right?
2009-01-27T07:10:00.000Z	alcane	laeg	where?
2009-01-27T07:10:00.000Z	laeg	alcane	the applications menu
2009-01-27T07:13:00.000Z	alcane	laeg	join linuxn00b
2009-01-27T07:14:00.000Z	laeg	alcane	what?
2009-01-27T07:15:00.000Z	alcane	laeg	join the channel #linuxn00b
2009-01-27T07:15:00.000Z	alcane	laeg	i don't know what else to do
2009-01-27T07:15:00.000Z	alcane	laeg	i'm at work so I'm not on my linux box
2009-01-27T07:16:00.000Z	laeg	alcane	np man, i appreciate the effort :) here's what i did, http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=144546
2009-01-27T07:18:00.000Z	laeg	alcane	it's crazy because the properties of the launcher i created using nano looks exactly like the one i created in the gui
