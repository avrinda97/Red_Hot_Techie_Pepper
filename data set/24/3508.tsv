2008-01-16T03:38:00.000Z	castigan		ok. i installed ubuntu desktop yesterday... but when i shared folders no one could access them via the windows network
2008-01-16T03:39:00.000Z	neverblue	castigan	what were you using to share them ?
2008-01-16T03:39:00.000Z	castigan		just what came with ubuntu desktop.
2008-01-16T03:39:00.000Z	castigan		smb i think it said.
2008-01-16T03:39:00.000Z	neverblue	castigan	well, what 'just comes with Ubuntu' needs to be configured
2008-01-16T03:39:00.000Z	castigan		i could see the shares via windows.. but could not access
2008-01-16T03:40:00.000Z	neverblue	castigan	which one are you sharing, the windows shares or the Ubuntu shares ?
2008-01-16T03:40:00.000Z	castigan		ok. on my 'server' i have two 160 gig sata drives.. one has ubuntu on it.. the other has windows files..ntfs.
2008-01-16T03:40:00.000Z	neverblue	castigan	when you reply to someone, it makes it alot easier if you add that persons nick in front, so they can see who your talking to
2008-01-16T03:41:00.000Z	castigan		i want to share them over the netowork
2008-01-16T03:41:00.000Z	castigan		sorry.
2008-01-16T03:42:00.000Z	neverblue	castigan	which, is 'them'
2008-01-16T03:42:00.000Z	neverblue	castigan	a windows share, or a linux share ?
2008-01-16T03:42:00.000Z	castigan		i would like to share the windows driver..
2008-01-16T03:42:00.000Z	castigan		sorry the windows drive...
2008-01-16T03:42:00.000Z	neverblue	castigan	a windows drive, then you share that on the windows box, that has nothing to do with Ubuntu
2008-01-16T03:43:00.000Z	castigan		nooo... i have two drives in the linux bos. i want them to be accessed by the windows network.
2008-01-16T03:43:00.000Z	castigan		surely this can be done.
2008-01-16T03:43:00.000Z	neverblue	castigan	when you reply to someone, it makes it alot easier if you add that persons nick in front, so they can see who your talking to
2008-01-16T03:43:00.000Z	castigan		ok neverblue
2008-01-16T03:43:00.000Z	neverblue	castigan	I'll ask you this one last time, are you sharing your windows share, or your Ubuntu shares ?
