2010-09-25T19:15:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	xbonesx	google for problems with each, (from ubuntu users), and see what would be more compatible
2010-09-26T22:44:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	xbonesx	check the connections between the graphics card and monitor
2010-09-26T22:44:00.000Z	xbonesx	aeon-ltd	they're good, i can boot the hdd
2010-09-26T22:44:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	xbonesx	between the gpu and monitor
2010-09-26T22:44:00.000Z	xbonesx	aeon-ltd	yesir
2010-09-26T22:45:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	xbonesx	ok, might just be incompatible drivers from the liveCD
2010-09-26T22:46:00.000Z	xbonesx	aeon-ltd	what i was thinking... is their anyway i could make a custom live cd with the preinstalled drivers?
2010-09-26T22:46:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	xbonesx	reconstructor
2010-09-26T22:46:00.000Z	xbonesx	aeon-ltd	can i get the from the synaptic?
2010-09-26T22:46:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	xbonesx	no its a website
2010-09-26T22:47:00.000Z	xbonesx	aeon-ltd	is in-cooperating a display driver very hard to do?
2010-09-26T22:48:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	xbonesx	no it should just be one package, also if you;ve got another gpu just use that until the install finish
2010-09-26T22:48:00.000Z	xbonesx	aeon-ltd	thought about that as well but unfortunately this a slimline hp desktop, very small pc case, no room for extra pci's
2010-09-26T22:49:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	xbonesx	you could install it to another pc make an iso with remastersys and install that
2010-09-26T22:51:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	xbonesx	is this the 10.04 disk?
2010-09-26T22:51:00.000Z	xbonesx	aeon-ltd	yesir
2010-09-26T22:52:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	xbonesx	you could wait a few days for 10.10 and use that iso
2010-09-26T22:52:00.000Z	xbonesx	aeon-ltd	when is it to release and is it recommended to switch considering 10.04 is LTS?
2010-09-26T22:53:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	xbonesx	its release is next month, don;t switch if you need LTS
2010-09-26T22:54:00.000Z	xbonesx	aeon-ltd	i might download it and install it on a separate partition just to check it out
2010-09-26T22:54:00.000Z	xbonesx	aeon-ltd	isnt there a beta right now?
2010-09-26T22:54:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	xbonesx	ok, i hope the problem is resolved by then
