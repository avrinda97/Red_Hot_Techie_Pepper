2005-11-03T09:44:00.000Z	crimsun	r00723r0	I was referring to the live cd
2007-07-19T08:10:00.000Z	crimsun	r00723r0	kill $(lsof -t /dev/dsp* /dev/audio* /dev/mixer*)
2007-07-19T08:10:00.000Z	r00723r0	crimsun	nothing is outputted from the nested command
2007-07-19T08:10:00.000Z	r00723r0	crimsun	so it doesn't kill anything
2007-07-19T08:11:00.000Z	crimsun	r00723r0	then use the entire string: lsof -t /dev/dsp* /dev/audio* /dev/mixer* /dev/seq* /dev/snd/*
