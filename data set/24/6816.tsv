2006-05-26T14:56:00.000Z	pinky		I cannot seem to mount an ISO image I have... "dmesg | tail" returns "Unable to identify CD-ROM format."   It's the third disc in a game (Mafia) and the other two mounted fine.
2006-05-26T14:57:00.000Z	pinky		It's worth mentioning that the other two ISO images are under 700MB but this one is 770MB
2006-05-26T14:57:00.000Z	pinky		Does that have anything to do with it?  Any suggestions?
2006-05-26T14:58:00.000Z	pinky		Perhaps an application that scans ISO files to see if there's something wrong with the iso9660 filesystem?
2006-05-26T15:00:00.000Z	pinky		Erm, you mean from the data DVD I burned?
2006-05-26T15:01:00.000Z	amphi	pinky	what does file say the image file is?
2006-05-26T15:01:00.000Z	pinky		mount -o loop -t iso9660 Mafia3.iso /mnt/iso/
2006-05-26T15:01:00.000Z	pinky		mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/loop1,
2006-05-26T15:02:00.000Z	pinky		       missing codepage or other error
2006-05-26T15:02:00.000Z	amphi	pinky	sounds corrupt - if file doesn't say 'ISO 9660 CD-ROM filesystem data', that's probably it
2006-05-26T15:03:00.000Z	pinky		eep
2006-05-26T15:03:00.000Z	pinky		isoinfo -i Mafia\ -\ Disc\ 3.iso
2006-05-26T15:03:00.000Z	pinky		CD-ROM is NOT in ISO 9660 format
2006-05-26T15:03:00.000Z	pinky		Umm, so what do I do here?  Is this just a *bad* image file?
2006-05-26T15:03:00.000Z	amphi	pinky	looks like - what does file say about it? just 'data'? ;)
2006-05-26T15:04:00.000Z	pinky	amphi	yes
2006-05-26T15:04:00.000Z	amphi	pinky	not a good sign
2006-05-26T15:04:00.000Z	pinky		Ugh, I made this image with Alcohol 120% I'm pretty sure
2006-05-26T15:04:00.000Z	pinky		I'm almost certain it worked under Windows...
2006-05-26T15:05:00.000Z	pinky		But it's obviously not a valid ISO9660 filesystem... so how do I tell what it is?  I mean I'm fairly certain it *is* a working image file.
2006-05-26T15:05:00.000Z	amphi	pinky	'almost certain' huh? ;)
2006-05-26T15:05:00.000Z	pinky		It's 770MB btw, whereas the first two discs of the game are under 700MB
2006-05-26T15:06:00.000Z	pinky	amphi	Hehe, yeah I should check first, but I really don't want to boot up into Windows
2006-05-26T15:06:00.000Z	amphi	pinky	file is pretty good at identifying things; if it says 'data' it's nothing overly standard or well-known
