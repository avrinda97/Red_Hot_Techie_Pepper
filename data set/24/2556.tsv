2008-11-08T09:36:00.000Z	qkall		i'm trying to set up a 3g usb modem on hardy... i can't figure it out...
2008-11-08T09:37:00.000Z	ziroday	qkall	what modem is it?
2008-11-08T09:39:00.000Z	qkall	ziroday	huawei e220
2008-11-08T09:39:00.000Z	ziroday	qkall	okay, the easiest way to get that setup is install the new network manager which comes by default in intrepid
2008-11-08T09:40:00.000Z	ziroday	qkall	you can also add the network manager ppa
2008-11-08T09:40:00.000Z	qkall	ziroday	thanks googling now
2008-11-08T09:41:00.000Z	ziroday	qkall	https://launchpad.net/~network-manager/+archive
2008-11-08T09:43:00.000Z	qkall	ziroday	thanks upgrading and rebooting
2008-11-08T10:03:00.000Z	qkall	ziroday	it reconizes the card all well but i can't get it to connect
2008-11-08T10:04:00.000Z	ziroday	qkall	make sure you have the right settings
2008-11-08T10:04:00.000Z	qkall	ziroday	i'm unsure what are the right settings... i don't even know what to google to find out... :-[
2008-11-08T10:08:00.000Z	qkall	ziroday	can you point me in the right direction... like what to google?
2008-11-08T10:10:00.000Z	ziroday	qkall	sorry was away, am really not sure. Best thing to do is ask your service provider or google your service providers name and linux
2008-11-08T10:11:00.000Z	qkall	ziroday	maybe if i knew what i was looking for exactly.. like the login name? vpn?
2008-11-08T10:12:00.000Z	ziroday	qkall	you are right clicking and going to edit connections > mobile broadband right?
2008-11-08T10:13:00.000Z	qkall	ziroday	yeah it reconizes everythign.. it just doesn't connect... no errors no nothing.. just doesn't work
2008-11-08T10:14:00.000Z	ziroday	qkall	err did you make sure your username and password was correct, for that matter all the settings were correct when right clicking?
2008-11-08T10:15:00.000Z	qkall	ziroday	honestly i don't know where to find that.. and i'm weary of calling att since they think i have a prepaid phone... heh.
2008-11-08T10:15:00.000Z	ziroday	qkall	well if you have att they're a pretty big telco, do you want me to try google around for you?
2008-11-08T10:16:00.000Z	qkall	ziroday	if i knew what to google i'd do it.. i just don't know what to google...
2008-11-08T10:17:00.000Z	ziroday	qkall	you might want to ask in #ubuntu-us or #ubuntu-us-<yourstate> as they will most likely know what settings are needed by the local telco
2008-11-08T10:17:00.000Z	qkall	ziroday	i went there first they tend to not respond... but i
2008-11-08T10:18:00.000Z	ziroday	qkall	sorry thats all I've got
2008-11-08T10:18:00.000Z	qkall	ziroday	no don
