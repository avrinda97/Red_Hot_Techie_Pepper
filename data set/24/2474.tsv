2008-12-26T18:50:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	v4vijayakumar	completely uninstall the mozilla-plugin-gnash  --> apt-get remove --purge mozilla-plugin-gnash
2008-12-26T18:51:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	v4vijayakumar	you probably aren't missing any codecs. it's a flash on x86_64 issue
2008-12-26T18:51:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	v4vijayakumar	after removing mozilla-plugin-gnash, go here --> http://labs.adobe.com/downloads/flashplayer10.html
2008-12-26T18:52:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	v4vijayakumar	at the bottom of that page download flash for x86_64
2008-12-26T18:53:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	v4vijayakumar	then close out firefox... tell me when you've done all that
2008-12-26T18:56:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	v4vijayakumar	ok... now  cd ~/.mozilla && mkdir plugins
2008-12-26T18:56:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	v4vijayakumar	don't worry, it's better than a lot of beta releases
2008-12-26T18:59:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	v4vijayakumar	ok, are you in ~/.mozilla and have you made the 'plugins' directory in there?
2008-12-26T19:00:00.000Z	v4vijayakumar	onetinsoldier	~/.mozilla/firefox/plugin or ~/.mozilla/plugin   ??
2008-12-26T19:00:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	v4vijayakumar	ok... now  cd ~/.mozilla && mkdir plugins
2008-12-26T19:00:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	v4vijayakumar	what is the output of   pwd  ??
2008-12-26T19:01:00.000Z	v4vijayakumar	onetinsoldier	~/.mozilla/firefox/plugin or ~/.mozilla/plugin   ??
2008-12-26T19:01:00.000Z	v4vijayakumar	onetinsoldier	~/.mozilla/firefox/plugins or ~/.mozilla/plugins   ??
2008-12-26T19:02:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	v4vijayakumar	just to do the following... cd ~/.mozilla && mkdir plugins && cd plugins
2008-12-26T19:02:00.000Z	v4vijayakumar	onetinsoldier	done ~/.mozilla/plugins
2008-12-26T19:03:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	v4vijayakumar	ok, good...  now tar -xzvf /path/to/libflashplayer-10.0.d21.1.linux-x86_64.so.tar.gz -C .
2008-12-26T19:05:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	v4vijayakumar	once you done that, open up firefox and put in the address bar  -->  about:plugins   ..see that it's installed, look at the version and make sure it looks correct
2008-12-26T19:07:00.000Z	v4vijayakumar	onetinsoldier	many thanks, it works :)
