2008-09-30T07:57:00.000Z	Gnea	Clutz	ooo, somehow, it's trying to use the vesa driver instead of nvidia - can you pastebin your /etc/X11/xorg.conf?

2008-09-30T07:58:00.000Z	Clutz	Gnea	the backed up one before i restored right?

2008-09-30T07:58:00.000Z	Gnea	Clutz	no, just the current one please
2008-09-30T07:59:00.000Z	Clutz	Gnea	I had to restore the default xorg so i could boot
2008-09-30T07:59:00.000Z	Gnea	Clutz	when it goes black like that, you should be able to ctrl-alt-f1
2008-09-30T07:59:00.000Z	Clutz	Gnea	oh, i didn't know that =P
2008-09-30T07:59:00.000Z	Clutz	Gnea	should i try again?
2008-09-30T08:00:00.000Z	Gnea	Clutz	go for it
2008-09-30T08:00:00.000Z	Clutz	Gnea	brb then
2008-09-30T08:12:00.000Z	Clutz	Gnea	no such luck, the computer is completely unresponsive at the black screen. can't even use num lock lol
2008-09-30T08:13:00.000Z	Clutz	Gnea	I tried ctrl+alt+F1 ctrl+alt+F2 and ctrl+alt+del nothing did anything lol
2008-09-30T08:16:00.000Z	Clutz	Gnea	jrib: here is the xorg.conf that was used http://paste.ubuntu.com/52319/
