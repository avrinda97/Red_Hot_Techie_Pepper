2005-08-30T08:36:00.000Z	tott		damn.. i need help.. :S
2005-08-30T08:37:00.000Z	tott		anyone got time to help? got a resolution prob..
2005-08-30T08:38:00.000Z	brenner	tott	let me guess, can't access higher res'?
2005-08-30T08:39:00.000Z	brenner	tott	was that yeah for me?
2005-08-30T08:41:00.000Z	brenner	tott	ok, then i'll walk you through ... post your xorg.conf to the pastebin in the topic
2005-08-30T08:46:00.000Z	brenner	tott	sudo ddcprobe | grep monitorrange
2005-08-30T08:47:00.000Z	brenner	tott	just checking: you wanted 1024 as your default res?
2005-08-30T08:48:00.000Z	brenner	tott	ok, first things first, what did the command above return?
2005-08-30T08:49:00.000Z	brenner	tott	eek, means we can't autodetect your monitor rates, we'll try using 1600 anyway
2005-08-30T08:49:00.000Z	brenner	tott	er, do you know how to use a console editor?  (in case things stuff up)
2005-08-30T08:51:00.000Z	brenner	tott	booting win won't fix things though :)
2005-08-30T08:51:00.000Z	brenner	tott	do that to make a backup copy
2005-08-30T08:51:00.000Z	brenner	tott	ok, we're gonna edit the file, before we do, write this down somewhere
2005-08-30T08:52:00.000Z	brenner	tott	sudo cp etc/X11/xorg.backup /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2005-08-30T08:52:00.000Z	brenner	tott	that will revert to the original copy
2005-08-30T08:52:00.000Z	brenner	tott	if X doesn't start for some reason after we edit this file, type that and you should be able to get back in
2005-08-30T08:53:00.000Z	brenner	tott	done? now, see the lines with 1024X768?
2005-08-30T08:54:00.000Z	brenner	tott	insert 1600x1200 before 1024, so the line should look like:
2005-08-30T08:54:00.000Z	brenner	tott	correction: edit _all_ the mode lines to that
2005-08-30T09:04:00.000Z	tott	brenner	it worked.. thanks alot!  :D
2005-08-30T09:04:00.000Z	brenner	tott	nice
2005-08-30T09:05:00.000Z	brenner	tott	copy the xorg.conf somewhere in case you need to do a reinstall
2005-08-30T09:05:00.000Z	brenner	tott	but i guess you know how to fix it now anyways :)
2005-08-30T09:05:00.000Z	tott	brenner	yeah.. ;)
