2011-04-14T05:38:00.000Z	dslip_work		its a 1ru xeon rack server
2011-04-14T05:40:00.000Z	dslip_work		thus I do not wish to waste cpu by simulating extra cores
2011-04-14T05:40:00.000Z	Ben64	dslip_work	having hyperthreading on won't hurt minecraft at all
2011-04-14T05:41:00.000Z	dslip_work	Ben64	are you sure, all my previous benchmarking (not on linux though) showed that for single thread performance, no hyperthreading is best
2011-04-14T05:41:00.000Z	Ben64	dslip_work	minecraft isn't single threaded though
2011-04-14T05:42:00.000Z	dslip_work	Ben64	no it isnt, but 1 thread is always under heavy utilisation
2011-04-14T05:43:00.000Z	Ben64	dslip_work	yeah, but hyperthreading wouldn't hurt unless you have a lot of system load
2011-04-14T05:43:00.000Z	dslip_work	Ben64	yeah yeah, was a good stopgap to start with
2011-04-14T05:44:00.000Z	dslip_work	Ben64	i am hoping to run a few after this
2011-04-14T05:44:00.000Z	dslip_work	Ben64	since its all the server has to do
2011-04-14T05:44:00.000Z	dslip_work	Ben64	how many players ?
2011-04-14T05:45:00.000Z	dslip_work	Ben64	that looks like a player cap of about 15
2011-04-14T05:45:00.000Z	dslip_work	Ben64	my server is a popular public server in australia, so we see a reasonable amount of players
2011-04-14T05:47:00.000Z	dslip_work	Ben64	i think i did pretty good for my budget. Spent $2500 AUD, 1ru rack, xeon x3470 @2.93ghz, 32gb DDR3 1066 ECC, 2 x 120Gb OCZ vertex2 SSD & 1 x 2tb seagate
2011-04-14T05:47:00.000Z	Ben64	dslip_work	internet connection?
2011-04-14T05:48:00.000Z	dslip_work	Ben64	will be 100mbit when it arrives at the host
2011-04-14T05:48:00.000Z	Ben64	dslip_work	you plan on having the world on the ssd?
2011-04-14T05:49:00.000Z	Ben64	dslip_work	worlds have a lot of writing going on, would probably kill an ssd fairly quick
2011-04-14T05:50:00.000Z	dslip_work	Ben64	why i said a test platform
2011-04-14T05:50:00.000Z	dslip_work	Ben64	im ok with them dying if it happens, otherwise will be nice to see the 285mb/s speeds
2011-04-14T05:50:00.000Z	dslip_work	Ben64	also why I did raid1 & have the 2tb for backup drive
2011-04-14T05:51:00.000Z	dslip_work	Ben64	if I fear the write cycles are too much for the ssd, will just dump the map to ramdisk, with 32gb i have enough to put aside some for map
2011-04-14T05:52:00.000Z	Ben64	dslip_work	with the region system, shouldn't have an issue on a normal HDD
2011-04-14T05:53:00.000Z	Ben64	dslip_work	it's not a lot of data, but its a lot of writes
