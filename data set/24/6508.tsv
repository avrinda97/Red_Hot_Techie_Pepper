2006-02-22T16:46:00.000Z	tritium	soundray	please don't encourage it
2006-03-10T16:13:00.000Z	tritium	soundray	:)
2006-03-10T16:51:00.000Z	tritium	soundray	dude, it's just out of courtesy and respect for others here that we ask users not to use profanity
2006-03-10T16:52:00.000Z	soundray	tritium	I know. I'm just arguing that the common abbreviation for the code of conduct is perfectly polite.
2006-03-10T16:53:00.000Z	tritium	soundray	okay...
2006-03-11T17:15:00.000Z	soundray	tritium	wow, it's called "Behaviour" here ;)  Very thoroughly britishified.
2006-03-11T17:16:00.000Z	tritium	soundray	yeah, and this Xchat-gnome's color preferences tab spells it "colour", even here :(
2006-03-11T17:17:00.000Z	soundray	tritium	that's all right, now, isn't it, mate? ;)
2006-03-11T17:17:00.000Z	tritium	soundray	it has an extra letter ;)
2006-03-11T17:20:00.000Z	tritium	soundray	"mate" is another one of those words that has a _completely_ different meaning here
2006-03-11T17:21:00.000Z	soundray	tritium	oh, a source of misunderstanding, like "keep your pecker up"? (pecker = nose)
2006-03-11T17:21:00.000Z	tritium	soundray	glad you clarified that meaning in parentheses ;)
2006-03-11T17:22:00.000Z	soundray	tritium	I better shut up now ;)
2006-03-11T17:24:00.000Z	tritium	soundray	when I was young, and hadn't read the lyrics, I thought Pink Floyd sang "no docks of hazzum in the claws room"
2006-03-11T17:26:00.000Z	soundray	tritium	may I quote you on that?
2006-03-11T17:26:00.000Z	tritium	soundray	be my guest :)
2006-03-11T17:28:00.000Z	tritium	soundray	in what form of media?  maybe I should have denied your request ;)
2006-03-11T17:29:00.000Z	soundray	tritium	I was thinking about a simultaneous Blimp ad over San Francisco, CA and London, England ;)
2006-03-11T06:14:00.000Z	soundray	tritium	have you got an idea for V4Vendetta?
2006-03-11T06:14:00.000Z	tritium	soundray	let me scroll back...
2006-03-11T06:15:00.000Z	soundray	tritium	running sudo qtparted, can't resize sda1, plenty of space...
2006-03-31T15:36:00.000Z	soundray	tritium	if the device name is ath0, it must be atheros/madwifi.
2006-03-31T15:36:00.000Z	tritium	soundray	as I told him
