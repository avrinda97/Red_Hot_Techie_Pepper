2011-09-24T00:28:00.000Z	quant		hello, after intalling Ubuntu 11.04, I get "autochk not found" when i try to boot into Vista and the machine restarts, any help, please?
2011-09-24T00:29:00.000Z	urlin2u	quant	I think that is a vista problem, did you install Ubuntu without resizing Vista first?
2011-09-24T00:30:00.000Z	quant	urlin2u	yes, it happens now after I've reinstalled Ubuntu
2011-09-24T00:30:00.000Z	quant	urlin2u	I didn't resize anything
2011-09-24T00:30:00.000Z	urlin2u	quant	you had a unallocated area for Ubuntu?
2011-09-24T00:30:00.000Z	quant	urlin2u	I had an ext4 partiton
2011-09-24T00:31:00.000Z	urlin2u	quant	so vista choice is going back ti the grub menu?
2011-09-24T00:31:00.000Z	quant	urlin2u	yes
2011-09-24T00:32:00.000Z	urlin2u	quant	I woluld try a sudo update-grub in ubuntu, if that doesn't work a chkdsk in vista using a recovery or istall to get to the repair console.
2011-09-24T00:33:00.000Z	quant	urlin2u	ok, ty
2011-09-24T00:33:00.000Z	urlin2u	quant	did you remove any vista partitions?
2011-09-24T00:34:00.000Z	quant	urlin2u	no
2011-09-24T00:35:00.000Z	urlin2u	quant	cool check that the bootflag is on the right partition for vista with gparted in Ubutu, as well
2011-09-24T00:36:00.000Z	quant	urlin2u	I've tried the boot flag on both my windows and ubuntu partition an no difference... where should the boot flag actually be?
2011-09-24T00:37:00.000Z	urlin2u	quant	without seeing the boot script I don't kmow not on ubuntu that is for sure.
