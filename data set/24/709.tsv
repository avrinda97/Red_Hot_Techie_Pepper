2011-11-25T15:38:00.000Z	gmzlj	gappie	for that, you shouldn't be doing it like that
2011-11-25T15:39:00.000Z	gmzlj	gappie	just start your command via upstart
2011-11-25T15:39:00.000Z	gmzlj	gappie	and thats it
2011-11-25T15:39:00.000Z	gappie	gmzlj	: upstart?

2011-11-25T15:40:00.000Z	gappie	gmzlj	: so do i edit something for upstart to work?
2011-11-25T15:40:00.000Z	gmzlj	gappie	whats the command you want to run?
2011-11-25T15:40:00.000Z	gmzlj	gappie	read some documentation, there's plenty of it a google away
2011-11-25T15:40:00.000Z	gmzlj	gappie	when?
2011-11-25T15:41:00.000Z	gmzlj	gappie	rc.local then
2011-11-25T15:42:00.000Z	gmzlj	gappie	how does this computer get turned on? im not sure i understand the utility of this
2011-11-25T16:07:00.000Z	gappie	gmzlj	: what about auto shutdown after x hours? is that also possible? someother placelike rc.local I can add code?
2011-11-25T16:08:00.000Z	gmzlj	gappie	yeah, but kinda silly
2011-11-25T16:08:00.000Z	gmzlj	gappie	what if someone is using the machine?
