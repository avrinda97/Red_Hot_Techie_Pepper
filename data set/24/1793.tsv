2009-08-25T00:11:00.000Z	tjc	bdelin88	Halitech : I've used vsftpd a tiny bit, what seems to be the problem ?
2009-08-25T00:11:00.000Z	bdelin88	tjc	i did an apt-get update the other day (i looked in the logs and didn't see any vsftpd related info) then all of a sudden these errors are now showing up after never having any issues: http://paste2.org/p/398188.  So i went ahead and purged/removed vsftpd and redid the config again... same issues are now occuring
2009-08-25T00:13:00.000Z	tjc	bdelin88	do you have a server side log by any chance ?
2009-08-25T00:13:00.000Z	bdelin88	tjc	yes, are you looking for the vsftpd log
2009-08-25T00:14:00.000Z	bdelin88	tjc	here is my log file... it's the same for the past few days: http://paste2.org/p/398202
2009-08-25T00:15:00.000Z	bdelin88	tjc	that's the strange thing is that it checks out
2009-08-25T00:15:00.000Z	tjc	bdelin88	do you use PAM for authentication? did you see anything strange in /var/log/messages ( or wherever it logs into ;)
2009-08-25T00:15:00.000Z	bdelin88	tjc	PAM?
2009-08-25T00:16:00.000Z	bdelin88	tjc	i just know that vsftpd has worked fine for 3 months since install and then all of a sudden after no personal changes to the config or anything it no longer works
2009-08-25T00:21:00.000Z	tjc	bdelin88	did you try to run it with the log_ftp_protocol enabled ?
2009-08-25T00:22:00.000Z	bdelin88	tjc	no, how do i do that
2009-08-25T00:22:00.000Z	tjc	bdelin88	you'd have to put log_ftpd_protocol=YES to your config
2009-08-25T00:23:00.000Z	bdelin88	tjc	where does that log output go to?
2009-08-25T00:23:00.000Z	tjc	bdelin88	need to check, brb.
2009-08-25T00:24:00.000Z	tjc	bdelin88	i've made a mistake : it should say log_ftp_protocol=YES
2009-08-25T00:25:00.000Z	bdelin88	tjc	trying that again
2009-08-25T00:25:00.000Z	tjc	bdelin88	It went to /var/log/vsftpd.log on my machine
2009-08-25T00:28:00.000Z	bdelin88	tjc	hmm, no new log messages and the log for the ftp client is still the same
2009-08-25T00:29:00.000Z	tjc	bdelin88	I'm unable to reproduce this, I responded fine to my FEAT
2009-08-25T00:30:00.000Z	tjc	bdelin88	I'm using version version 2.0.7
2009-08-25T00:34:00.000Z	tjc	bdelin88	I like http://www.pureftpd.org/project/pure-ftpd
2009-08-25T00:36:00.000Z	bdelin88	tjc	I noticed a pam_service_name=vsftpd maybe this is the PAM thing you're talking about?
2009-08-25T00:39:00.000Z	tjc	bdelin88	yes, most probably that is used for authentication on your machine
2009-08-25T00:39:00.000Z	tjc	bdelin88	but this is irrelevant to your issue it would appear.
