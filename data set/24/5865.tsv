2006-04-06T08:50:00.000Z	green_earz	keur	how are you downloading the cd image http or ftp or bittorent, if you can the bittorent method is the best for large files and the completed file is error check is perfect copy
2006-04-06T08:51:00.000Z	keur		ftp ....much faster for me...im in France by proxad
2006-04-06T08:51:00.000Z	keur		i'll probably Md5 it for the errors
2006-04-06T08:52:00.000Z	green_earz	keur	is there a md5sum file for the cd image so you can check ?
