2009-08-23T01:25:00.000Z	migg137		Hello, is there a way to make my windows bar transparent, they do when it is the non selected window, but i want them to always be transparent. Thankyou
2009-08-23T01:27:00.000Z	edbian	migg137	"sudo apt-get install simple-ccsm" to get a program to configure compiz
2009-08-23T01:28:00.000Z	migg137	edbian	i have compiz advanced setting manager already
2009-08-23T01:28:00.000Z	edbian	migg137	Then what are you looking for?
2009-08-23T01:28:00.000Z	migg137	edbian	how to make my windows bar transparent i do not know how
2009-08-23T01:29:00.000Z	edbian	migg137	That is actually part of the "emerald" project.  You have to install emerald: "sudo apt-get install emerald" and then you have to turn it on
2009-08-23T01:29:00.000Z	migg137	edbian	i have emerald... but how do i configure it
2009-08-23T01:30:00.000Z	edbian	migg137	There is also a emerald settings manager in the repos.  To turn it on "emerald --replace&" in a terminal
2009-08-23T01:31:00.000Z	migg137	edbian	thankyou so now if i want to turn it of how do i do that
2009-08-23T01:31:00.000Z	edbian	migg137	"compiz --replace&"
2009-08-23T01:32:00.000Z	edbian	migg137	or possibly "metacity --replace&" but that might shut off compiz as well.
2009-08-23T01:33:00.000Z	migg137	edbian	the first compiz-- replace did not work i still have the emerald thewme thing
2009-08-23T01:34:00.000Z	edbian	migg137	"metacity --replace&"
2009-08-23T01:34:00.000Z	migg137	edbian	now i dont have the minimize buttons or close buttons
2009-08-23T01:34:00.000Z	edbian	migg137	"metacity --replace"
2009-08-23T01:34:00.000Z	migg137	edbian	i closed the terminal and it worked... thanks
2009-08-23T01:35:00.000Z	edbian	migg137	A restart will bring them back W.C.S.  The proper way to start emerald with compiz is to add "emerald" to the window decorator plugin.
2009-08-23T01:35:00.000Z	edbian	migg137	In the ccsm
2009-08-23T01:36:00.000Z	migg137	edbian	ok i have that enabled in ccsm but now how do i add it the proper way
2009-08-23T01:37:00.000Z	edbian	migg137	?  That is the proper way.
2009-08-23T01:37:00.000Z	migg137	edbian	o0k thankyou very much
2009-08-23T01:37:00.000Z	edbian	migg137	Now when you restart compiz will call "emerald" instead of metacity
2009-08-23T01:37:00.000Z	edbian	migg137	NP! :)
2009-08-23T01:37:00.000Z	edbian	migg137	Good luck ubuntu-ing!
