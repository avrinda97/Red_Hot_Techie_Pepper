2008-05-10T12:53:00.000Z	okaasan		Sup people
2008-05-10T12:53:00.000Z	okaasan		I've got a problem
2008-05-10T12:54:00.000Z	okaasan		I just upgraded to 8.04 from 7.10 and whenever I try to enable restricted drivers, my comp dies
2008-05-10T12:54:00.000Z	okaasan		it boots to the console login prompt, the screen blanks for a bit, a few times
2008-05-10T12:54:00.000Z	okaasan		and it boots to low graphics mode
2008-05-10T12:54:00.000Z	okaasan		and no matter what I do from there, it doesn't help
2008-05-10T12:54:00.000Z	okaasan		and I can't get into virtalconsole or anything
2008-05-10T12:54:00.000Z	okaasan		and running in recovery and using xfix fixes it, but I'm using vesa now
2008-05-10T12:55:00.000Z	okaasan		which is not ideal
2008-05-10T12:55:00.000Z	drivetrax	okaasan	 Low-res?  What video card
2008-05-10T12:57:00.000Z	drivetrax	okaasan	 -- get to a terminal?
2008-05-10T12:57:00.000Z	okaasan	drivetrax	Yeah, in low graphics mode it wouldn't let me ctrl-alt-F1 or anything
2008-05-10T12:58:00.000Z	drivetrax	okaasan	 if you can get to a terminal prompt in bash.. then gedit /etc/X11/Xorg.conf and paste it at pastebin.ca
2008-05-10T13:00:00.000Z	drivetrax	okaasan	 -- getting a look at xorg.conf.. will tell if drivers are misconfigured
2008-05-10T13:01:00.000Z	okaasan	drivetrax	I know, and I'm enough of a console geek that I think I could fix it, however, as soon as I enable restricted drivers, my computer basically locks down
2008-05-10T13:03:00.000Z	drivetrax	okaasan	 -- if you can use the new xorg.conf it makes.. then remove the restricted drivers, DISABLE them
2008-05-10T13:05:00.000Z	drivetrax	okaasan	 advice: use the drivers ubuntu has for your card.. no multiversed restricted.. until you determine
2008-05-10T13:06:00.000Z	okaasan	drivetrax	I want the ones in the restricted driver one cause vesa dan't play 1080i/p to save its life
2008-05-10T13:07:00.000Z	drivetrax	okaasan	 do as told by adam7... because then you can set the default device..correctly, and enable the driver
2008-05-10T13:08:00.000Z	drivetrax	okaasan	 there are two device settings.. your priority device (main monitor & driver, and a Fall back.. when you get low-resolution, the fall-back is getting to steal the settings
2008-05-10T13:17:00.000Z	drivetrax	okaasan	 - yah.. I have ATI.. metacity controlled
2008-05-10T13:17:00.000Z	okaasan	drivetrax	How'd you get it to use the fglrx driver or whatever then?
2008-05-10T13:17:00.000Z	drivetrax	okaasan	 we ripped mine out..
2008-05-10T13:19:00.000Z	drivetrax	okaasan	 - very helpful in #compiz-fusion..
