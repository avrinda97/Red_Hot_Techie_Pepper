2008-06-08T20:24:00.000Z	cara		hello all
2008-06-08T20:25:00.000Z	cara		I reinstalled ubuntu using wubi and it keeps installing my system as amd64
2008-06-08T20:25:00.000Z	cara		I'm not even using 64bit system
2008-06-08T20:25:00.000Z	cara		in fact I'm using intel
2008-06-08T20:26:00.000Z	cara		so why does it keep setting itself up for 64bit?
2008-06-08T20:26:00.000Z	yell0w	cara	some intels do have 64bit extension like amds
2008-06-08T20:27:00.000Z	yell0w	cara	ie x86_64
2008-06-08T20:28:00.000Z	yell0w	cara	if you don't want it then shouldn't there be a step asking you what version to install ?
2008-06-08T20:28:00.000Z	yell0w	cara	btw which disk are you using to install ?
2008-06-08T20:30:00.000Z	yell0w	cara	maybe you got the wrong wwubi ?
2008-06-08T20:32:00.000Z	cara	yell0w	there's only one installer
2008-06-08T20:36:00.000Z	yell0w	cara	maybe try wubi --32bit ?
2008-06-08T20:37:00.000Z	yell0w	cara	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=580494
2008-06-08T20:40:00.000Z	yell0w	cara	np
2008-06-08T20:40:00.000Z	cara	yell0w	the reason why I want 32bit is because I'm doing some graphics programming and they're just shite
2008-06-08T20:41:00.000Z	yell0w	cara	did the --32bit option work ?
2008-06-08T20:41:00.000Z	yell0w	cara	well it is in an early stage
2008-06-08T20:42:00.000Z	yell0w	cara	probably just overwrite it
2008-06-08T20:42:00.000Z	yell0w	cara	ok
2008-06-08T20:45:00.000Z	cara	yell0w	the install started don't know if its actually installing the 32bit version
2008-06-08T20:46:00.000Z	yell0w	cara	it should work as per http://wubi-installer.org/faq.php
2008-06-08T20:48:00.000Z	yell0w	cara	it is there, read the last link i gave you about half way down
2008-06-08T20:48:00.000Z	cara	yell0w	I mean in the installation dialog
2008-06-08T20:49:00.000Z	yell0w	cara	yes agree, but i'm not a wubi dev. file a bug ?
