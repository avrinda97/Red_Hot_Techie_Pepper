2008-03-08T06:56:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	blake__	what did you do?
2008-03-08T07:01:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	blake__	maybe you should actually dual boot, instead of vmware?
2008-03-08T07:01:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	blake__	so what happens when you power down and restart?
2008-03-08T07:02:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	blake__	is this text file in vmware, or on the host OS?
2008-03-08T07:04:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	blake__	well, this is probably gonna be a lesson in why you should make incremental savefs
2008-03-08T07:05:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	blake__	geez man, don't you keep backups?
2008-03-08T07:05:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	blake__	pretty unlikely
2008-03-08T07:06:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	blake__	well, hopefully you learned your lesson
2008-03-08T07:07:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	blake__	well, you've clearly not learned the intended lesson.. as thats horse crap
2008-03-08T07:09:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	blake__	an *unstable OS* has nothing to do with it, the problem is pounding on the keyboard complaining right now
2008-03-08T07:09:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	blake__	no, its not because of ubuntu, how many times do you have to be told that?.. you failed to make a proper backup
2008-03-08T07:11:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	blake__	you're still blaming he OS i see?
2008-03-08T07:14:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	blake__	any luck?
2008-03-08T07:18:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	blake__	once again, you complain about the OS, when your failure to keep a current backup, is the main issue.
