2011-05-18T10:59:00.000Z	Surlent777	widewake	open a terminal, and then use the "cd" command to get to where the JAR file is. From there, type sudo chown yourusername:yourusername filename.jar
2011-05-18T11:01:00.000Z	Surlent777	widewake	okay, put the file onto your desktop
2011-05-18T11:01:00.000Z	Surlent777	widewake	then, in the terminal, type "cd ~/Desktop" but without the quotes
2011-05-18T11:02:00.000Z	Surlent777	widewake	okay, with the file in the desktop and after typing cd ~/Desktop, type "sudo chown yourusername:yourusername" replacing yourusername with whatever your user name is.
2011-05-18T11:04:00.000Z	Surlent777	widewake	you should be in ~/Desktop, or /home/yourusername/Desktop; both are equivalent
2011-05-18T11:06:00.000Z	Surlent777	widewake	again, move the JAR file onto your desktop, then in the terminal type "cd ~/Desktop". After that, type "sudo chown yourname:yourname filename.jar"
2011-05-18T11:06:00.000Z	Surlent777	widewake	after doing that, you should be able to then type "
2011-05-18T11:07:00.000Z	Surlent777	widewake	after doing that, you should be able to then type "chmod +x filename.jar"
2011-05-18T11:08:00.000Z	widewake	Surlent777	sudo chown namename,  chmod +x done
2011-05-18T11:08:00.000Z	Surlent777	widewake	try running your jar file as you did previously. This should have solved your problem.
2011-05-18T11:09:00.000Z	widewake	Surlent777	it has wont execute, and will not let to option execute it.. will try some things
2011-05-18T11:10:00.000Z	widewake	Surlent777	does folder access matter? they are all on access files
2011-05-18T11:11:00.000Z	Surlent777	widewake	a JAR file should either execute or open as an archive...are you saying it's opening in the file browser?
2011-05-18T11:13:00.000Z	widewake	Surlent777	could not find main class. also if i double click the folder will open with files
2011-05-18T11:20:00.000Z	widewake	Surlent777	there is also a lock symbol on my folder. guessing that is read only, though its not checked
2011-05-18T11:21:00.000Z	Surlent777	widewake	yes, that would normally mean read-only. Your permissions tab should have it listed as Read and Write for you and your group
2011-05-18T11:22:00.000Z	widewake	Surlent777	when i switch around folder access, file access, to read and write it will go back wont stay. files access will return to ...
2011-05-18T11:23:00.000Z	Surlent777	widewake	I think that's a visual glitch. It should still stick. To make sure, open that terminal, go back to the Desktop, and type ls -al. There will be a string of letters to the left of the jar's file name.
2011-05-18T11:25:00.000Z	widewake	Surlent777	 thats odd. its listing  a .jar and a .jar(2)
2011-05-18T11:25:00.000Z	Surlent777	widewake	wow, that's new. would you mind posting the full output on the pastebin website and showing me?
2011-05-18T11:26:00.000Z	widewake	Surlent777	dont mind, will get
2011-05-18T11:30:00.000Z	widewake	Surlent777	Thanks for help, resolved problem!
