2008-01-25T11:33:00.000Z	un_op	fatedkiss	it's also called 'ubufox'
2008-01-27T10:36:00.000Z	un_op	fatedkiss	 that changes the root to the choot so that you can begin installing stuff in there
2008-01-27T10:37:00.000Z	fatedkiss	un_op	so would i run that command then use w-get to install linux32?
2008-01-27T10:38:00.000Z	un_op	fatedkiss	does the howto suggest you do that?
2008-01-27T10:38:00.000Z	fatedkiss	un_op	no thats kinda how i got thrown off earlier all it says to do is install the package, so when i did i got the promt to remove others
2008-01-27T10:40:00.000Z	un_op	fatedkiss	you didnt run the command in the chroot if you were prompted to remove something
2008-01-27T10:41:00.000Z	fatedkiss	un_op	right..but i wasnt promted to..thats why im confused..because what im undertsnading is your saying i should..
2008-01-27T10:41:00.000Z	un_op	fatedkiss	ok, never mind what's happened this far -- delete the chroot folder and start again -  rm -rf /var/chroot/gutsy
2008-01-27T10:42:00.000Z	un_op	fatedkiss	but follow the howto this time -- no synaptic or doing things your way
2008-01-27T13:50:00.000Z	un_op	fatedkiss	I dunno why you are having problems -- whats up now?
2008-01-27T13:50:00.000Z	fatedkiss	un_op	flash
2008-01-27T13:51:00.000Z	un_op	fatedkiss	pm me
2008-01-27T13:52:00.000Z	fatedkiss	un_op	3 really
2008-01-27T13:53:00.000Z	un_op	fatedkiss	ok, 3 then -- pm me
2008-01-27T13:54:00.000Z	fatedkiss	un_op	i was advised all i need to do is install a 32bit flash or 32bit firfox instead of going through chroot wich is honestly not making sence
2008-01-27T13:54:00.000Z	un_op	fatedkiss	it doesnt make sense to me either - afaik, you need a chroot to get 32bit apps running within a 64bit system
2008-01-27T13:55:00.000Z	un_op	fatedkiss	how well did it go with the chroot?
2008-01-27T13:55:00.000Z	fatedkiss	un_op	the instructions work but there parts in it that make no sence. like where and how to install the linux32 without removing necessery files
2008-01-27T13:57:00.000Z	un_op	fatedkiss	pretty much everything you install is in the chroot - except the first two packages schroot and debootstrap
2008-01-27T13:58:00.000Z	fatedkiss	un_op	the thing is it doesnt tell you when to change directories or if you have to at all
2008-01-27T13:59:00.000Z	un_op	fatedkiss	well it does -- about the 3rd command asks you to chroot, and everything from there on happens in the chroot
2008-01-27T14:00:00.000Z	un_op	fatedkiss	if you're out of patience, you could try the link voltagex just posted, it looks promising
2008-01-27T14:00:00.000Z	fatedkiss	un_op	and when i do that i got those errors i posted earlier
2008-01-27T14:01:00.000Z	un_op	fatedkiss	scrap the chroot project, it's probably not worth it
