2010-01-24T07:27:00.000Z	Billiard	MauritianGuy	any reason you dont use the nvidia drivers from the package manager?
2010-01-24T07:28:00.000Z	MauritianGuy	Billiard	 its not working
2010-01-24T07:32:00.000Z	Billiard	MauritianGuy	this is when the drivers are installed and enabled?
2010-01-24T07:34:00.000Z	Billiard	MauritianGuy	did you try the 185 driver? and how did you install it?
2010-01-24T07:35:00.000Z	MauritianGuy	Billiard	 i uninstall reboot and instell 185, id did the same for 173
2010-01-24T07:35:00.000Z	Billiard	MauritianGuy	how did you install 185?
2010-01-24T07:37:00.000Z	MauritianGuy	Billiard	 i uses systems>administration>Hardware Drivers and shoose 185
2010-01-24T07:37:00.000Z	Billiard	MauritianGuy	ok, and hardware drivers had shown the driver as enabled?
2010-01-24T07:38:00.000Z	Billiard	MauritianGuy	i would run the appearance dialog from the terminal and look at the errors you get when you try to enable the special effects, after installing the 185 drivers
2010-01-24T07:39:00.000Z	MauritianGuy	Billiard	 how would i do that
2010-01-24T07:40:00.000Z	Billiard	MauritianGuy	no? idk what you mean
2010-01-24T07:40:00.000Z	Billiard	MauritianGuy	one sec, let me find the command for the appearance dialog
2010-01-24T07:43:00.000Z	Billiard	MauritianGuy	you currently have 185 installed? if so, run "gnome-appearance-properties" from a terminal, and attempt to enable the visual effects, then pastebin the errors it gives you in the terminal
2010-01-24T07:47:00.000Z	Billiard	MauritianGuy	ok
