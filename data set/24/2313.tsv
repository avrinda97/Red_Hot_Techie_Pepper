2009-01-31T23:55:00.000Z	gp101	momomo	no dmesg output when plug in a usb devidec
2009-01-31T23:55:00.000Z	gp101	momomo	it works under windows
2009-01-31T23:56:00.000Z	momomo	gp101	maybe during initial startup of computer?
2009-01-31T23:56:00.000Z	gp101	momomo	what do you mean?
2009-01-31T23:57:00.000Z	momomo	gp101	as i understand you you checked the dmesg output after plugging in the usb device. dmesg might have logged an error right during power up of the computer already
2009-01-31T23:58:00.000Z	gp101	momomo	if i paste my dmesg, can you look at it, I don't see much, I see [    1.938328] usbcore: registered new device driver usb, but that's it
2009-01-31T23:58:00.000Z	momomo	gp101	if you dont mind for privacy, just pastebinit

2009-01-31T23:59:00.000Z	gp101	momomo	I don't mind, I don't think there is anything people can use to hack my system.  http://paste.ubuntu.com/112202/
2009-02-01T00:04:00.000Z	gp101		can someone help me, lsusb gives no output
2009-02-01T00:04:00.000Z	momomo	gp101	hmm, lines 343. "ohci" no guarantees but my linux book referring to kernel 2.4 mentions that it directly relates to usb
2009-02-01T00:05:00.000Z	gp101	momomo	what do you think I should do?
2009-02-01T00:05:00.000Z	momomo	gp101	add the suggested boot parameter from dmesg and try a restart
2009-02-01T00:07:00.000Z	gp101	momomo	ok I'll try to add pci=biosirq
2009-02-01T00:08:00.000Z	momomo	gp101	yes, good luck
2009-02-01T00:13:00.000Z	gp101	momomo	it worked  how can I make that permanent?
2009-02-01T00:13:00.000Z	gp101	momomo	during setup I had to add noacpi acpi=off to the boot line
2009-02-01T00:13:00.000Z	gp101	momomo	could that be the problem?
2009-02-01T00:15:00.000Z	momomo	gp101	dont know how the switches exactly interrelate, sorry, one sec
2009-02-01T00:15:00.000Z	gp101	momomo	how do I make what I add to the bootline permanent?
2009-02-01T00:15:00.000Z	momomo	gp101	1 sec
