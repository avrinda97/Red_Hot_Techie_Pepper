2007-08-31T12:09:00.000Z	serenityUK	MissDjax	do they still have values for volume up/down?.... mine say  0Xae   and  0xb0
2007-08-31T12:10:00.000Z	MissDjax	serenityUK	yes they have, XF86AudioVolumeDown ..
2007-08-31T12:13:00.000Z	serenityUK	MissDjax	if you click on the value XF86Audio... and then press the volume key on the keyboard it stays the same?
2007-08-31T12:14:00.000Z	MissDjax	serenityUK	yes it stays the same
2007-08-31T12:17:00.000Z	MissDjax	serenityUK	>> do they still have values for volume up/down?.... mine say  0Xae   and  0xb0 -   <--- maybe I should try to get those "default" values back ?
2007-08-31T12:18:00.000Z	serenityUK	MissDjax	it maybe because we have different keyboards
2007-08-31T12:18:00.000Z	MissDjax	serenityUK	but I remember that I already had those values as well
2007-08-31T12:36:00.000Z	MissDjax	serenityUK	? what output does xev give you when hitting for example volume up ?
2007-08-31T12:41:00.000Z	MissDjax	serenityUK	 ya, most 0 ... on the multimedia keys that are responding I have that too (stop, next, etc) but on the 2 not working (volume up/down) I have what I sent you on PM
