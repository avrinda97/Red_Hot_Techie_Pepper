2010-08-28T17:02:00.000Z	sacarlson		you never stop learning .... unless your me you just keep getting dumber.
2010-08-28T17:03:00.000Z	undifined	sacarlson	the more you learn the more you reallize you are dumb :-)
2010-08-31T09:44:00.000Z	sacarlson	undifined	did you try it in safemode?
2010-08-31T09:44:00.000Z	undifined	sacarlson	how again ? :)
2010-08-31T09:45:00.000Z	sacarlson	undifined	I don't know how I've only seen that there is a method to add to the command line that makes all extensions turn off to test it.
2010-08-31T09:46:00.000Z	sacarlson	undifined	yes http://kb.mozillazine.org/Safe_mode#Starting_Safe_Mode
2010-08-31T09:47:00.000Z	sacarlson	undifined	what did you do compile it?
2010-08-31T09:49:00.000Z	undifined	sacarlson	might be the new xul-runner ?
2010-08-31T09:49:00.000Z	sacarlson	undifined	I run an older custom version of ff Namoroka/3.6.9pre to make watir work.  but I did also try and compile the one from firefox don't recall the version
2010-08-31T09:50:00.000Z	sacarlson	undifined	could be
2010-08-31T09:50:00.000Z	undifined	sacarlson	I run maverick and packages beyond
2010-08-31T09:50:00.000Z	sacarlson	undifined	oh I run in 10.04 and beyound I just ppa or compile
2010-08-31T09:51:00.000Z	undifined	sacarlson	i do not compile, my machine is old >7 years but i do a lot of bug hunting
2010-08-31T09:51:00.000Z	sacarlson	undifined	my 8 year old computer compiles just find.  it just takes longer.
2010-09-04T08:14:00.000Z	undifined	sacarlson	I still have the software center running, any idea how to do something for bugreporting on the memleak ?
2010-09-04T08:15:00.000Z	sacarlson	undifined	what memleak?
2010-09-04T08:16:00.000Z	sacarlson	undifined	I guess I don't use software-center.  is that part of synaptic?
2010-09-04T08:18:00.000Z	sacarlson	undifined	you want me to install it and test it?
2010-09-04T08:20:00.000Z	sacarlson	undifined	well I just check and I do seem to have it installed.  I guess that's what opens when I double click on a deb file.
2010-09-04T08:20:00.000Z	undifined	sacarlson	indeed
2010-09-04T08:21:00.000Z	undifined	sacarlson	and when i install a piece of software and it is done it consumes 100 mb more memory
2010-09-04T08:21:00.000Z	sacarlson	undifined	oh it stays resident?
2010-09-04T08:23:00.000Z	sacarlson	undifined	I just checked and it's not in my ps -A list so I guess I have it disabled or something.
2010-09-04T08:24:00.000Z	undifined	sacarlson	well then I hope I can reproduce later
