2007-06-25T15:40:00.000Z	hideandseek		Hi all
2007-06-25T15:41:00.000Z	hideandseek		So I installed the updated Nvidia drivers for my legacy gf2 ti.  After installing X will no longer start.  I says "No screens found."  What do I do?!?
2007-06-25T15:42:00.000Z	Ireal	hideandseek	check the logs :)
2007-06-25T15:42:00.000Z	Ireal	hideandseek	somewhere in /var/log, look for files named Xorg.*
2007-06-25T15:44:00.000Z	hideandseek	Ireal	I had to boot into Ubuntu with the CD, since all I can do is use the terminal
2007-06-25T15:44:00.000Z	Ireal	hideandseek	well.. you have to use the terminal ;)
2007-06-25T15:45:00.000Z	hideandseek	Ireal	well I have no problem with that, its just i cant pull up wiki and look at the solution, or talk to you kids on irc
2007-06-25T15:45:00.000Z	Ireal	hideandseek	i suppose that's true (irssi is a text IRC client)
2007-06-25T15:46:00.000Z	Ireal	hideandseek	oo, spiffy :)
2007-06-25T15:46:00.000Z	Ireal	hideandseek	you could try to run the nvidia-config application when in the terminal, if i'm not mistaken, it configures your xorg.conf properly. That's the file that tells the X-server how to act :)
2007-06-25T15:48:00.000Z	Ireal	hideandseek	don't think so
2007-06-25T15:48:00.000Z	Ireal	hideandseek	yes, don't forget to run it using sudo: sudo nvidia-config :)
2007-06-25T15:51:00.000Z	Ireal	hideandseek	that's the x.org file from the CD or your HD ?
2007-06-25T15:52:00.000Z	Ireal	hideandseek	okay, to use the nvidia drivers change Driver "nv" to Driver "nvidia"
2007-06-25T15:52:00.000Z	Ireal	hideandseek	doesn't look bad otherwise :)
2007-06-25T15:54:00.000Z	hideandseek	Ireal	so all i need to do is make that one change?
2007-06-25T15:54:00.000Z	hideandseek	Ireal	when I try to save it says i dont have permissions.  I'm using gedit, do I have to use pico, nano, or vi?
2007-06-25T15:55:00.000Z	Ireal	hideandseek	it is a root file, sudo nano -w /etc/X11/xorg.conf :)
2007-06-25T15:55:00.000Z	Ireal	hideandseek	you wouldn't want regular users messing with yer xorg files now would ya :)
2007-06-25T15:56:00.000Z	Ireal	hideandseek	well there's your account, and the root account :) and the account you work with is restricted so it cannot mess with the system too much
2007-06-25T15:57:00.000Z	Ireal	hideandseek	to perform changes to the system you need root-priviledges which you can attain using the sudo comand. you just type your own password after executing it and you have ascended to greater power!
2007-06-25T15:58:00.000Z	hideandseek	Ireal	ya, I took a couple of unix courses, but I kinda slept through em a little bit.  Wish I paid more attention.  You said I can use some kind of terminal chat program right?  What do I have to do to use it?
2007-06-25T16:00:00.000Z	Ireal	hideandseek	check your pm :)
2007-06-25T16:01:00.000Z	Ireal	hideandseek	i'm going to lunch :)
