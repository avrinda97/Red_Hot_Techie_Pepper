2007-09-06T14:15:00.000Z	Yarcanox		how can I view onto my usb floppy disk drive
2007-09-06T14:15:00.000Z	Yarcanox		I tried to mount fd0 which I thought it would be
2007-09-06T14:15:00.000Z	Yarcanox		(I don't have a built-in floppy drive)
2007-09-06T14:15:00.000Z	Yarcanox		but it didn't work
2007-09-06T14:16:00.000Z	Yarcanox		will an usb floppy disk drive appear as fd0 or something else? I tried to mount fd0 (which seems to exist), but it didnt work (I don't have a built-in floppy drive). on dmesg I read: [13436.791416]  Buffer I/O error on device fd0, logical block 0
2007-09-06T14:18:00.000Z	ConfidentiaL	Yarcanox	I guess you could run fdisk -l as root, and find the device that matches your floppy...
2007-09-06T14:19:00.000Z	Yarcanox		no I can't match it confidential
2007-09-06T14:19:00.000Z	Yarcanox		the only thing I can do is to guess, and copying something on a guessed device is shit
2007-09-06T14:19:00.000Z	Yarcanox		as I don't want to overwrite all the data of a hard disk partition
2007-09-06T14:19:00.000Z	Yarcanox		(with a floppy disk image)
2007-09-06T14:20:00.000Z	ConfidentiaL	Yarcanox	ok, can't help you then, sorry. Stopped using floppies long before I started with linux:P
2007-09-06T14:20:00.000Z	Yarcanox		confidential the problem seems to be that the floppy disk contains trash
2007-09-06T14:20:00.000Z	Yarcanox	ubuntu	throws up then and refuses to mount it
2007-09-06T14:20:00.000Z	Yarcanox		there should be a mechanism to mount it anyway to format it or something
2007-09-06T14:21:00.000Z	ConfidentiaL	Yarcanox	so you could format it?
2007-09-06T14:21:00.000Z	Yarcanox		no!
2007-09-06T14:21:00.000Z	Yarcanox		I can't access it
2007-09-06T14:21:00.000Z	Yarcanox		I tried to copy an image onto it with dd
2007-09-06T14:21:00.000Z	Yarcanox		does the device have to be mounted for that?
2007-09-06T14:22:00.000Z	ConfidentiaL	Yarcanox	dd?
2007-09-06T14:22:00.000Z	Yarcanox		I guess it has, so I tried to mount it, but if it is fd0 (I don't even know if it is, as it is an usb floppy disk), it doesn't work
2007-09-06T14:22:00.000Z	Yarcanox		confidential image copying tool to copy the image onto the floppy disk
2007-09-06T14:22:00.000Z	Yarcanox		I don't know if the device needs to be mounted for that
2007-09-06T14:23:00.000Z	ConfidentiaL	Yarcanox	can't help you then. Never used that software, sorry...
