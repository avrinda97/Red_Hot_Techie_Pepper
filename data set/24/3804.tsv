2007-10-09T11:09:00.000Z	meeper	nickrud	thanks
2008-06-13T08:17:00.000Z	nickrud	meeper	I've done it in ~/.gnomerc , now I just do the path there
2008-06-13T08:18:00.000Z	nickrud	meeper	so I have my ~/bin in the path for alt-f2
2008-06-13T08:18:00.000Z	meeper	nickrud	not sure I understand
2008-06-13T08:18:00.000Z	nickrud	meeper	that would be a very good use for ~/.gnomerc
2008-06-13T08:19:00.000Z	nickrud	meeper	it gets read when gnome starts, and you can set env variables for the gnome session there
2008-06-13T08:19:00.000Z	meeper	nickrud	I'll try it. Thanks very much.
2008-06-13T08:21:00.000Z	meeper	nickrud	it doesn't look like .gnomerc is getting run. does it have to be executable?
2008-06-13T08:22:00.000Z	nickrud	meeper	hm, I do believe it's sourced
2008-06-13T08:22:00.000Z	nickrud	meeper	haven't set it up in hardy though. I hope it didn't change
2008-06-13T08:31:00.000Z	meeper	nickrud	the .gnomerc is being called, I added 'xterm &' as the last line. but somehow JAVA_HOME is still undefined argh
2008-06-13T08:33:00.000Z	nickrud	meeper	you are doing  export JAVAHOME ?
2008-06-13T08:38:00.000Z	meeper	nickrud	thanks for your help
2008-06-13T08:39:00.000Z	nickrud	meeper	did it work for you?  export JAVAHOME ?
2008-06-13T08:39:00.000Z	meeper	nickrud	yeah it works niow but I had to duplicate my env variables
2008-06-13T08:39:00.000Z	nickrud	meeper	makes better sense, anyway. And now, you don't need them in .bashrc ;)
2008-06-13T08:40:00.000Z	nickrud	meeper	.gnomerc is read by dash iirc, it's not bash
2008-06-13T08:40:00.000Z	meeper	nickrud	well I prefer them in .bashrc. I could perhaps source .gnomerc from .bashrc
2008-06-13T08:40:00.000Z	meeper	nickrud	what's dash?
2008-06-13T08:40:00.000Z	nickrud	meeper	a type of shell, but with less capability than bash
2008-06-13T08:41:00.000Z	meeper	nickrud	yeah, hmm, one of the pages I read mentioned dash
2008-06-13T08:42:00.000Z	nickrud	meeper	put something on ubuntu-forums as well, a lot of people search there. Or link to your blog, that will help with the stats ;)
2008-06-13T08:43:00.000Z	meeper	nickrud	I'll put it on forums. It seems the appropriate solution is perhaps to export JAVA_HOME in .gnomerc and then source .gnomerc from .bashrc
