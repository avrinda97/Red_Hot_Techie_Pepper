2006-06-21T11:18:00.000Z	wastrel	dumbledore	 try ctrl-alt-f2  to drop to terminal  usually any bootable cd can be used as a rescue disk... depending what you need to do
2006-06-21T11:19:00.000Z	wastrel	dumbledore	 ctrl-alt-f7 returns from that
2006-06-21T11:20:00.000Z	dumbledore	wastrel	all i get is cmd prompt
2006-06-21T11:20:00.000Z	wastrel	dumbledore	 not a root prompt?
2006-06-21T11:20:00.000Z	dumbledore	wastrel	yeah, but what am i supposed to do from that
2006-06-21T11:20:00.000Z	wastrel	dumbledore	 anything you want :]  what do you need to do
2006-06-21T11:21:00.000Z	dumbledore	wastrel	reinstall grub

2006-06-21T11:22:00.000Z	dumbledore	wastrel	that says i have to use the rescue thing tho
2006-06-21T11:23:00.000Z	dumbledore	wastrel	and my cd won't let me
2006-06-21T11:24:00.000Z	wastrel	dumbledore	 no that's a different section.  look at the "using the livecd" section
2006-06-21T11:27:00.000Z	dumbledore	wastrel	i put in root (hd1,1)
2006-06-21T11:27:00.000Z	dumbledore	wastrel	and it says filesystem type unknown
2006-06-21T11:28:00.000Z	dumbledore	wastrel	,partition type 0x93
2006-06-21T11:29:00.000Z	wastrel	dumbledore	 is that your ubuntu boot partition?
2006-06-21T11:29:00.000Z	dumbledore	wastrel	yes
2006-06-21T11:30:00.000Z	wastrel	dumbledore	 i'm not competent to assist with grub troubleshooting, perhaps some other kind soul will take over from here...
2006-06-21T11:43:00.000Z	dumbledore	wastrel	thx ill give it a shot :O
2006-06-21T11:31:00.000Z	wastrel	dumbledore	 you're sure that's where your linux /boot resides?
2006-06-21T11:35:00.000Z	wastrel	dumbledore	 take a look at the drive numbers in your /boot/grub/menu.lst  :] 
2006-06-21T11:36:00.000Z	wastrel	dumbledore	 if it's root(1,1) i dunno what to tell you :/
2006-06-21T11:36:00.000Z	dumbledore	wastrel	yeah it is :/
2006-06-21T11:38:00.000Z	wastrel	dumbledore	 google sez grub bug may change partition type to 0x93 - you can fix with fdisk maybe?  don't wipe your drive 8-O
2006-06-21T11:43:00.000Z	dumbledore	wastrel	do you know what the id is supposed to be for the ntfs drives too by any chance? im having a hard time finding a list of all the fs numbers
