2007-10-03T09:56:00.000Z	riotkittie		yay. internets.
2007-10-03T09:58:00.000Z	riotkittie		hmm. i wonder if i should try ndiswrapper on that-which-shall-not-be-discussed-here
2007-10-03T09:59:00.000Z	DoYouKnow	riotkittie	the native drivers work fine for that
2007-10-03T09:59:00.000Z	DoYouKnow		you just have to tinker with them
2007-10-03T09:59:00.000Z	DoYouKnow		turn the card on and off, change the access point to something else then back to the correct one
2007-10-03T09:59:00.000Z	DoYouKnow		eventually dhclient will work
2007-10-03T10:00:00.000Z	riotkittie	DoYouKnow	i'm not a native-driver-tinkerer-with-them-er ... and i'd have no clue where to start :P
2007-10-03T10:00:00.000Z	DoYouKnow	riotkittie	just type "ifconfig <your_interface> off", "ifconfig <your_interface> on"
2007-10-03T10:01:00.000Z	DoYouKnow		then "iwconfig essid dfkjdkdjfkjdf"
2007-10-03T10:01:00.000Z	DoYouKnow		"iwconfig essid <your_ssid>
2007-10-03T10:01:00.000Z	DoYouKnow		"
2007-10-03T10:01:00.000Z	DoYouKnow		oh whoops
2007-10-03T10:01:00.000Z	DoYouKnow		insert your interface name before essid
2007-10-03T10:01:00.000Z	DoYouKnow		do this under sudo bash
2007-10-03T10:02:00.000Z	riotkittie	DoYouKnow	oh no, it's not that. i can connect and everything, and its just smashing, save for the fact that my connection dies and i have to reboot to bring it back up
2007-10-03T10:02:00.000Z	DoYouKnow	riotkittie	sometimes broadcom gets set in the wrong mode
2007-10-03T10:02:00.000Z	DoYouKnow		so you have to tinker with the settings
2007-10-03T10:02:00.000Z	DoYouKnow		to get it reset
2007-10-03T10:02:00.000Z	riotkittie	DoYouKnow	I dont have a bcom :P
2007-10-03T10:02:00.000Z	DoYouKnow		oh, it's not a broadcom?
2007-10-03T10:02:00.000Z	DoYouKnow		I thought we were talking about the broadcom
2007-10-03T10:02:00.000Z	riotkittie		nope. i have an ralink.
2007-10-03T10:04:00.000Z	DoYouKnow	riotkittie	well, I have a broadcom so I had to keep messing with different things. initially I think I had to reload the module a few times to get it working but now just tinkering with the commands iwconfig and ifconfig seem to do it
2007-10-03T10:04:00.000Z	riotkittie	DoYouKnow	I dont have such luck :P
