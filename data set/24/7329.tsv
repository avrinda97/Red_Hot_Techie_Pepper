2005-06-12T10:13:00.000Z	i3dmaster	FR500	as the command shows..
2005-06-12T10:14:00.000Z	i3dmaster	FR500	let me see
2005-06-12T10:16:00.000Z	i3dmaster	FR500	it keeps asking me the username and the password which I've provided to and I am sure that's the right username and password cause that's my win box
2005-06-12T10:17:00.000Z	FR500	i3dmaster	windows is stupid
2005-06-12T10:17:00.000Z	i3dmaster	FR500	absolutely right
2005-06-12T10:17:00.000Z	FR500	i3dmaster	in your windows connection properties on the windoze box, in the authentication area select the 2 later options (check them)

2005-06-12T10:25:00.000Z	i3dmaster	FR500	hey here, I was going to the #samba channel and see if anyone knows about this problem, but unfortunately, that cha was so quiet...
2005-06-12T10:25:00.000Z	FR500	i3dmaster	did it work (enbling the 2 checkbosxes)
2005-06-12T10:26:00.000Z	i3dmaster	FR500	ok, I think I need a little bit more clear instructions, I went to the network connection properties windows, and there are two checkboxes but am i correct?
2005-06-12T10:28:00.000Z	i3dmaster	FR500	by the way, I've turned off the security stuff from sp2
