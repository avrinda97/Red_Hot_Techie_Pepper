2007-09-19T06:59:00.000Z	erUSUL	Tobia1	thunderbird in windows can import dbx afaik then you just copy de mbox files to ubuntu...
2007-09-19T06:59:00.000Z	erUSUL	Tobia1	maybe something like http://www.box.net/ can help you
2007-09-19T07:00:00.000Z	Tobia1	erUSUL	well I tried importing directly to no avail, you need to have outlook installed...
2007-09-19T07:02:00.000Z	erUSUL	Tobia1	http://email.about.com/od/outlookexpressaddons/gr/dbxconv.htm ??
2007-09-19T07:05:00.000Z	Tobia1	erUSUL	yeah that is the tool I used in the end, combined with some tool to help import mbox files in thunderbird
2007-09-19T07:06:00.000Z	erUSUL	Tobia1	have you checked the box.net link it offers 1GB of space upload files there and then dl them from ubuntu
2007-09-19T07:07:00.000Z	Tobia1	erUSUL	looking now, did not look when you posted it because firefox crashed
2007-09-19T07:22:00.000Z	Tobia1	erUSUL	well thanks but didn't work, box.net only allows files of 10mb. readpst doesnt convert dbx...
2007-09-19T07:22:00.000Z	Tobia1	erUSUL	did manage to share the folder but networking connection can't be assablished...
2007-09-19T07:22:00.000Z	erUSUL	Tobia1	:(
2007-09-19T07:23:00.000Z	erUSUL	Tobia1	are you in a lan?
2007-09-19T07:23:00.000Z	erUSUL	Tobia1	can you ping between hosts
2007-09-19T07:25:00.000Z	Tobia1	erUSUL	yes ping get through
2007-09-19T07:25:00.000Z	erUSUL	Tobia1	you can use nc on both ends to a quick and dirty file transfer
2007-09-19T07:27:00.000Z	erUSUL	Tobia1	netcat
2007-09-19T07:30:00.000Z	erUSUL	Tobia1	on the ubuntu machine do 'nc -l -p 1234 > file' on the vista one (once you get nc for windows) 'type file | nc -w 3 ubuntumachineip 1234' .
2007-09-19T07:30:00.000Z	erUSUL	Tobia1	iirc type is the DOS equivalent of cat
2007-09-19T07:33:00.000Z	Tobia1	erUSUL	then you can prolly also tell me the command to find ip from ubuntu machine?
2007-09-19T07:33:00.000Z	erUSUL	Tobia1	ifconfig
2007-09-19T07:56:00.000Z	Tobia1	erUSUL	sorry but I'm getting a headache from this, netcat for windows..?? can't find it, seems all links are dead
2007-09-19T08:59:00.000Z	erUSUL	Tobia1	you can install firefox in windows let it import ie favorites and then use the firefox export bookmarks utility. copy de file over an import it in the ubuntu firefox
2007-09-19T09:00:00.000Z	Tobia1	erUSUL	lol ok
2007-09-19T09:00:00.000Z	erUSUL	Tobia1	convoluted but effective :)
