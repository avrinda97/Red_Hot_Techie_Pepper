2010-02-11T18:01:00.000Z	silis		What the heck is the problem that i cannot access my new mounted ext4 partition only with root privileges? I can see that disk mounted in my desktop, but cant do nothing copy files in it etc.. here is my /etc/fstab : http://paste.ubuntu.com/373934/
2010-02-11T18:01:00.000Z	ikonia	silis	which mouont point are you trying to access
2010-02-11T18:02:00.000Z	silis	ikonia	/dev/sda2, i cann access it but i cant do any changes on it
2010-02-11T18:02:00.000Z	ikonia	silis	show me the command that's failing ?
2010-02-11T18:02:00.000Z	silis	ikonia	Did u look my paste.ubuntu ?
2010-02-11T18:03:00.000Z	ikonia	silis	I only saw you're fstab
2010-02-11T18:05:00.000Z	silis	ikonia	ok, i'll try delete this file which i copyed with root privileges in it and it gives me this error: rm: remove write-protected regular file `NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-190.53-pkg2.run'? y
2010-02-11T18:06:00.000Z	silis	ikonia	if o login in root i can do whatever i want do with that mounted partition
2010-02-11T18:06:00.000Z	ikonia	silis	show me the ouptut of ls -la on that file
2010-02-11T18:07:00.000Z	silis	ikonia	ofcourse it is root here it is: -rw-r--r--  1 root root 23111088
2010-02-11T18:07:00.000Z	ikonia	silis	ok - so that's correct, only root should be able to delete that file
2010-02-11T18:09:00.000Z	ikonia	silis	so there is no problem, the file is owned by root, so only root should be able to delete it
2010-02-11T18:10:00.000Z	silis	ikonia	yea but i want o access it because i mounted that partition for that reason to give me more space as user
2010-02-11T18:10:00.000Z	ikonia	silis	then change the ownership, or permissions
2010-02-11T18:10:00.000Z	silis	ikonia	can i change it from xserver?
2010-02-11T18:11:00.000Z	ikonia	silis	do you mean from a gui ?
2010-02-11T18:11:00.000Z	silis	ikonia	ok i login as root and try again, i tryed it before  as root but no result
2010-02-11T18:12:00.000Z	silis	ikonia	so the point is is my fstab fine? coz i tought lines in there should change that partition to be used as a user
2010-02-11T18:12:00.000Z	ikonia	silis	all good
2010-02-11T18:13:00.000Z	silis	ikonia	ok i re-login as a root
2010-02-11T18:14:00.000Z	ikonia	silis	you don't need to login as root
2010-02-11T18:14:00.000Z	ikonia	silis	just do sudo chown -R $username:root /media/storage where $username = your username
2010-02-11T18:14:00.000Z	silis	ikonia	hehe so tell me what do then..
2010-02-11T18:16:00.000Z	silis	ikonia	invalid option -r
