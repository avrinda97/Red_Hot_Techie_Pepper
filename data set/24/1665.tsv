2010-01-25T08:34:00.000Z	tLoFP		how can I make an .iso Image of a CD?
2010-01-25T08:35:00.000Z	jiohdi	tLoFP	dd if=cdromx of=whatever.iso
2010-01-25T08:35:00.000Z	tLoFP	jiohdi	like dat... for real? no software to install?
2010-01-25T08:35:00.000Z	jiohdi	tLoFP	dd does it all :)
2010-01-25T08:37:00.000Z	tLoFP	jiohdi	it didn't find cdromx
2010-01-25T08:37:00.000Z	jiohdi	tLoFP	you have to sub cdromx for your actual location
2010-01-25T08:37:00.000Z	jiohdi	tLoFP	it was not meant to be literal
2010-01-25T08:37:00.000Z	tLoFP	jiohdi	I have cdrom and cdrom0 both seem to access the disk, whats the diff?
2010-01-25T08:37:00.000Z	jiohdi	tLoFP	it could be something like /media/cdrom0
2010-01-25T08:38:00.000Z	tLoFP	jiohdi	yea I have /media/cdrom and /media/cdrom0 but they both direct me to the contents of the cd
2010-01-25T08:38:00.000Z	jiohdi	tLoFP	than it likely does not matter which you use
2010-01-25T08:39:00.000Z	tLoFP	jiohdi	dd: reading `/media/cdrom': Is a directory
2010-01-25T08:39:00.000Z	tLoFP		no .iso
2010-01-25T08:39:00.000Z	tLoFP	jiohdi	cdrom0 does the same
2010-01-25T08:39:00.000Z	jiohdi	tLoFP	dd turns the contents into an iso file
2010-01-25T08:40:00.000Z	tLoFP	jiohdi	no... you .... you can't make .iso that fast
2010-01-25T08:40:00.000Z	tLoFP		its... its not possible... is it ?
2010-01-25T08:40:00.000Z	jiohdi	tLoFP	you can I have done it
2010-01-25T08:40:00.000Z	tLoFP	jiohdi	I mean it was instant
2010-01-25T08:41:00.000Z	jiohdi	tLoFP	check the size of the file
2010-01-25T08:41:00.000Z	tLoFP	jiohdi	lol no the iso is 0 bytes, something wrong
2010-01-25T08:42:00.000Z	jiohdi	tLoFP	check out http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-newbie-8/learn-the-dd-command-362506/
2010-01-25T08:42:00.000Z	jiohdi	tLoFP	I may have left out something
2010-01-25T08:50:00.000Z	tLoFP	jiohdi	I did through the GUI, it seems to be working on it now
