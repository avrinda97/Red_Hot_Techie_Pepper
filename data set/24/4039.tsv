2007-10-18T04:13:00.000Z	youknowme		I'm trying to navigate my file system through the terminal, but everytime I come across a filename with a space in it I can't navigate the terminal because it sees the spaces as the end of the command string.
2007-10-18T04:13:00.000Z	youknowme		What am I doing wrong? I know it must be an obvious answers..
2007-10-18T04:14:00.000Z	Vlet	youknowme	put a \ in front of the space
2007-10-18T04:14:00.000Z	youknowme	Vlet	1 sec, I'll try
2007-10-18T04:15:00.000Z	youknowme	Vlet	no go
2007-10-18T04:15:00.000Z	Vlet	youknowme	you know that you can also start typing a few letters of the file or directory name, and hit tab, and it should complete it automaticallty
2007-10-18T04:15:00.000Z	Vlet	youknowme	you used a backslash like this \, not a forward slash like this /, right?

2007-10-18T04:18:00.000Z	Vlet	youknowme	I just said, be sure you're using a BACKSLASH like this: \ not a forward slash like this: / :)
2007-10-18T04:18:00.000Z	youknowme	Vlet	and therein lies the problem, thanks. I knew it was a stupid mistake
2007-10-18T04:19:00.000Z	youknowme	Vlet	:)
2007-10-22T02:10:00.000Z	Vlet	youknowme	well, look at the line in your menu.lst that you're trying to load, and check what disk it is claiming it is on
2007-10-22T02:12:00.000Z	youknowme	Vlet	how wold I go about doing that? I be a noob.
2007-10-22T02:12:00.000Z	youknowme	Vlet	it worked two seconds before I restated it, all should be fine..
2007-10-22T02:13:00.000Z	Vlet	youknowme	and what did you do before you restarted?
2007-10-22T02:14:00.000Z	youknowme	Vlet	well I actually hibernated it, and then accidentally powered it on and off numerous times..
2007-10-22T02:15:00.000Z	Vlet	youknowme	so you can't boot it now at all, eh...
2007-10-22T02:15:00.000Z	youknowme	Vlet	no.. sucks. Can you help?
2007-10-22T02:16:00.000Z	Vlet	youknowme	there's not much I can do. You can try looking into this: http://supergrub.forjamari.linex.org/
2007-10-22T02:17:00.000Z	Vlet	youknowme	you could also try booting off the install CD to try to fix your disks, but I have no idea what you've done to them... sounds like your drive is hurt
2007-10-22T02:40:00.000Z	youknowme	Vlet	ah man SGD didn't work, any other ideas?
2007-10-22T02:42:00.000Z	Vlet	youknowme	not really - it sounds like you could have damaged the drive/partition
2007-10-22T02:46:00.000Z	youknowme	Vlet	impossible, that would suck.
2007-10-22T02:49:00.000Z	Vlet	youknowme	impossible? yes it would suck, but you said you kept kicking it on and off over and over
