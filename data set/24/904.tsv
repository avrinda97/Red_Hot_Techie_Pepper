2011-05-23T00:16:00.000Z	nit-wit	psych	are you trying to get the cube, and do you have alink for help or a strategy?
2011-05-23T00:17:00.000Z	psych	nit-wit	not in fact, I'm just trying to run compiz
2011-05-23T00:17:00.000Z	nit-wit	psych	cool
2011-05-23T00:17:00.000Z	psych	nit-wit	after dist-upgrade, it turned it off
2011-05-23T00:18:00.000Z	psych	nit-wit	and when I try to run it manually, pc get crashed
2011-05-23T00:18:00.000Z	nit-wit	psych	do you have the config manager installed
2011-05-23T00:19:00.000Z	psych	nit-wit	ccsm?
2011-05-23T00:19:00.000Z	nit-wit	psych	do you have the copiz configuration gui installed?
2011-05-23T00:20:00.000Z	psych	nit-wit	CompizConfig Settings Manager, ccsm - no?
2011-05-23T00:21:00.000Z	psych	nit-wit	any though?
2011-05-23T00:21:00.000Z	nit-wit	psych	what happens wwhen you put ccsm in the terminal and hit enter?
2011-05-23T00:23:00.000Z	psych	nit-wit	I can access the GUI and etc, but no matter what I change, no Compiz plugin seems to work
2011-05-23T00:23:00.000Z	psych	nit-wit	but when I run compiz --replace, X get crashed
2011-05-23T00:24:00.000Z	nit-wit	psych	you are in never never land there are link to specif changes maily to the cube. You can always log out of the desktop and restart as well. If this is your main OS you better be ready for it to fail if you peck at compiz without the right knowledge.
2011-05-23T00:25:00.000Z	psych	nit-wit	thank you for your time, but that was not helpful
2011-05-23T00:26:00.000Z	nit-wit	psych	it would be helpful if you understood the fair warning we can't hold your hand ;)
