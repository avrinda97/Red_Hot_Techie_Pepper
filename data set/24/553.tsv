2011-06-09T18:34:00.000Z	Jacco	jud	you can just redirect any output using sort -u file.txt > file2.txt or use the -o option
2011-06-09T18:36:00.000Z	Jacco	jud	.. try also reading the ouput of 'man sort'
2011-06-09T18:39:00.000Z	jud	Jacco	why do i keep getting back No such file or directory...i'm in the directory the file is in...???
2011-06-09T18:39:00.000Z	Jacco	jud	.. what command are you using exactly?
2011-06-09T18:40:00.000Z	jud	Jacco	Desktop$ sort -u fu.txt>fu2.txt
2011-06-09T18:40:00.000Z	Jacco	jud	whats the output of 'which sort'
2011-06-09T18:42:00.000Z	jud	Jacco	 you mean output from ls?
2011-06-09T18:42:00.000Z	Jacco	jud	no just type 'which sort' for me please (with out the quotes) on your computer
2011-06-09T18:43:00.000Z	jud	Jacco	 /usr/bin/sort
2011-06-09T18:46:00.000Z	jud	Jacco	was that what you're after?
2011-06-09T18:49:00.000Z	jud	Jacco	/usr/bin/sort: open failed: fu.txt: No such file or directory
2011-06-09T18:49:00.000Z	Jacco	jud	then the file you are trying to sort is not named fu.txt or isnt it the current directory
2011-06-09T18:51:00.000Z	jud	Jacco	 ok it's a gedit file called fu...i assumed it would have a .txt extension
2011-06-09T18:51:00.000Z	Jacco	jud	no linux is never aware of extension really..
2011-06-09T18:53:00.000Z	jud	Jacco	great then Desktop$ sort -u fu>fu2 worked like a charm. Thanks
2011-06-09T18:53:00.000Z	Jacco	jud	yw
2011-06-09T18:54:00.000Z	jud	Jacco	 yw?
2011-06-09T18:54:00.000Z	Jacco	jud	yw == your welcome
2011-06-09T18:54:00.000Z	jud	Jacco	 ah cool ...cheers
2011-06-09T18:58:00.000Z	jud	Jacco	 sorry mate..the list size has been reduced. what it did was put it into alphabetical order and reduce the size but there are still quite a few repeats in there. any ideas?
2011-06-09T18:58:00.000Z	Jacco	jud	the -u option sorts and keeps uniques only if thats what you want?
2011-06-09T18:59:00.000Z	Jacco	jud	the -n option sorts on numbers .. etc etc. See 'man sort'
2011-06-09T19:00:00.000Z	jud	Jacco	that's what i thought but sort -u fu>fu2 didn't remove all duplicates...I'll look cheers
2011-06-09T19:01:00.000Z	Jacco	jud	i cant judge until i see what the file is made of :) sorry
