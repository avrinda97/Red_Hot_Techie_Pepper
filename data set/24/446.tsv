2011-12-02T20:10:00.000Z	glebaron		Macbook Pro 7,1: I insert 10.04 install cd and it throws me to a busybox screen and says "not init found. Try passing init= bootarg."
2011-12-02T20:10:00.000Z	glebaron		Any suggestions?
2011-12-02T20:10:00.000Z	popey	glebaron	i have that laptop
2011-12-02T20:11:00.000Z	popey	glebaron	I dont think i ever ran 10.04 on it, only releases after that, and are you booting in BIOS or EFI mode?
2011-12-02T20:11:00.000Z	glebaron	popey	it would be sweet if I could get ubuntu on it.
2011-12-02T20:11:00.000Z	popey	glebaron	I have Ubuntu 11.10 on mine
2011-12-02T20:11:00.000Z	glebaron	popey	How do I change the mode?
2011-12-02T20:11:00.000Z	popey	glebaron	are you planning to dual boot OSX or single install Ubuntu?
2011-12-02T20:12:00.000Z	glebaron	popey	single install
2011-12-02T20:12:00.000Z	popey	glebaron	I dont think 10.04 will work in EFI mode out of the box
2011-12-02T20:13:00.000Z	popey	glebaron	boot the laptop and hold down ALT and it should give you a menu. I think you can choose there whether to boot in EFI or BIOS mode
2011-12-02T20:13:00.000Z	glebaron	popey	newer versions will?
2011-12-02T20:13:00.000Z	popey	glebaron	yes, 11.10 works
2011-12-02T20:13:00.000Z	popey	glebaron	I have 11.10 in EFI mode which is a problem because nVidia binary driver doesn't work in EFI mode â˜¹
2011-12-02T20:15:00.000Z	glebaron	popey	when I hold down option key, it just shows me the boot from cd choice.
2011-12-02T20:15:00.000Z	glebaron	popey	computer is currently wiped.
2011-12-02T20:16:00.000Z	popey	glebaron	does it show two cdroms or one on screen when you hold down alt?
2011-12-02T20:16:00.000Z	glebaron	popey	one.
2011-12-02T20:16:00.000Z	popey		hmm
2011-12-02T20:19:00.000Z	popey	glebaron	not sure, sorry, i used 11.10 and it pretty much works okay
2011-12-02T20:20:00.000Z	popey	glebaron	some glitches
2011-12-02T20:21:00.000Z	glebaron	popey	I had it on my older macbook.
2011-12-02T20:21:00.000Z	glebaron	popey	guess I will have to try the dual boot.
2011-12-02T20:21:00.000Z	glebaron	popey	just don't like the newer versions.
