2008-06-09T03:39:00.000Z	sapph		I just converted from XP to Ubuntu.  At first I was running off a LiveCD, and everything worked fine, so I did the install.  No problems there.  Then I went to update, and it updated me to 'Hearty Heron' or something like that.  Ever since that update, I have been unable to connect to my local network.  Trying DHCP just nets me a private IP, and static IPs won't even let me ping my router.  The LiveCD DOES work though - and its an older ve
2008-06-09T03:40:00.000Z	soundray	sapph	first thing to check is whether your update completed: 'sudo apt-get -f install ; sudo dpkg --configure -a'
2008-06-09T03:41:00.000Z	sapph	soundray	0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded
2008-06-09T03:42:00.000Z	soundray	sapph	is this a wireless interface?
2008-06-09T03:43:00.000Z	soundray	sapph	the one you're trying to use, does it have activity LEDs near the socket?
2008-06-09T03:44:00.000Z	sapph	soundray	I have no easy way of seeing the activity LEDs
2008-06-09T03:46:00.000Z	soundray	sapph	I guess unplugging it would be hard, then, too
2008-06-09T03:47:00.000Z	sapph	soundray	The interfaces worked fine in the LiveCD, which configured them in 'roaming' mode.  That doesn't work now, though.
2008-06-09T03:47:00.000Z	sapph	soundray	Actually, reaching back to unplug is not too bad.  But my arm is thinning than my head ;p
2008-06-09T03:48:00.000Z	soundray	sapph	when you go through System-Admin-Network, you can't switch the interface to roaming?
2008-06-09T03:51:00.000Z	sapph	soundray	I certainly can switch it to roaming.  I can't ping anything regardless of whether it is in roaming or not, though.
2008-06-09T03:52:00.000Z	soundray	sapph	what does 'mii-tool' say?
2008-06-09T03:54:00.000Z	sapph	soundray	on eth0 thourgh eth7 (keep in mind I only have up to 1) it says: SIOCGMIIPHY on 'eth0' failed: Operation not permitted.   Then it says no MII interfaces found
2008-06-09T03:55:00.000Z	soundray	sapph	erm, sudo mii-tool (sorry)
2008-06-09T03:55:00.000Z	sapph	soundray	Okay, this time the exact something only for just eth0 and eth1
2008-06-09T03:59:00.000Z	sapph	soundray	I don't know what happened, but now it says no network devices found and the network settings thingy from Admin panel doesn's show any of the interfaces
2008-06-09T04:00:00.000Z	soundray	sapph	are there any related error messages in dmesg?
2008-06-09T04:08:00.000Z	sapph	soundray	The system starting acting odd - unstable and slow, so I did a restart.  I'll get back to you once boot is complete
2008-06-09T04:11:00.000Z	sapph	soundray	Okay, rebooting brought my interfaces back, and they are both in 'roaming mode'.  However, unlike in the LiveCD, one has failed to obtain an IP address at all, and the other has an automatic private address (in the 169.254 subnet)
2008-06-09T04:13:00.000Z	soundray	sapph	sorry, I won't be much use to you any more tonight. I suggest you look through dmesg output or /var/log/syslog to see if any difficulties with the network card are reported.
2008-06-09T04:14:00.000Z	soundray	sapph	I think it's possible that you're looking at a proper bug, considering that it works from the old live CD. (Does it work with the hardy live CD?)
2008-06-09T04:14:00.000Z	sapph	soundray	I'll try burning one and see.
2008-06-09T04:15:00.000Z	soundray	sapph	do ask the channel again if you're still stuck. Sometimes it takes a few repetitions (leave 10+ minutes intervals) to get a reply.
2008-06-09T04:16:00.000Z	soundray	sapph	logging off now. Good luck
