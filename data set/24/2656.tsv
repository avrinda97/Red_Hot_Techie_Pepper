2010-10-19T06:51:00.000Z	arex\	Nautilus	np, anything to avoid working on this buttfucking javascript application
2010-10-19T06:54:00.000Z	Nautilus	arex\	I see "post_max_size = 8M" and "upload_max_filesize = 16M". My UI is showing 8M max, though looking at that I would think it would be 16. Do I change the former one, both?  I want probably 32M
2010-10-19T06:55:00.000Z	arex\	Nautilus	when you say that your UI is showing 8M max, what are you referring to?
2010-10-19T06:56:00.000Z	Nautilus	arex\	drupal (CMS)
2010-10-19T06:56:00.000Z	arex\	Nautilus	Try changing 8M to 32M and see if that is updated in Drupal :)
2010-10-19T06:56:00.000Z	arex\		(remember to restart apache)
2010-10-19T06:56:00.000Z	Nautilus		do i restart apache? oh ok ;)
