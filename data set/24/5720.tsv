2008-01-21T01:03:00.000Z	Gizmo_The_Great		Why do users have read access to other users home folders by default?
2008-01-21T01:04:00.000Z	mwe	Gizmo_The_Great	I don't like that either. chmod o-rwx ~ to change it
2008-01-21T01:05:00.000Z	Gizmo_The_Great	mwe	yeah, cheers. It's madness. Cannot understand why it's like that.
2008-01-21T01:06:00.000Z	mwe	Gizmo_The_Great	develpors decided. I don't know why, though.
2008-01-21T01:06:00.000Z	Gizmo_The_Great	mwe	is that chmod switch saying "Make the owner have read, write and execute of your home folder" thus meaning everyone else does not have that?
2008-01-21T01:07:00.000Z	mwe	Gizmo_The_Great	no it says revoke read, write and execution perms for others
2008-01-21T01:08:00.000Z	Gizmo_The_Great	mwe	oh yeah....the - I missed that
2008-01-21T01:08:00.000Z	mwe	Gizmo_The_Great	you could chmod 750 ~ if you prefer
2008-01-21T01:08:00.000Z	mwe	Gizmo_The_Great	or 700 even
2008-01-21T01:09:00.000Z	Gizmo_The_Great	mwe	the problem I have is that I have a mounts folder that points to a drive that I do want other users to access, but it's only mounted from my home folder. So if I apply 750 to ~ they won't be able to navigate to the shared folder.
2008-01-21T01:10:00.000Z	mwe	Gizmo_The_Great	mount it elsewhere like /mnt/something
2008-01-21T01:11:00.000Z	Gizmo_The_Great	mwe	UI could do, but it's how I've always had it and I'm kinda used to it now! :-(
2008-01-21T01:11:00.000Z	mwe	Gizmo_The_Great	I think it's your only option if you restrict access to ~
2008-01-21T01:12:00.000Z	Gizmo_The_Great	mwe	indeed. I am currently searching the net to try and find the reasoning behind why users are given read access by default. I cannot understand it!
2008-01-21T01:12:00.000Z	mwe	Gizmo_The_Great	it's common. other users only have read access
2008-01-21T01:14:00.000Z	mwe	Gizmo_The_Great	I think it's for historical reasons. it's been custom for a long time in *nix I think
2008-01-21T01:14:00.000Z	Gizmo_The_Great	mwe	but even Windows doesn't allow that AFAIK
2008-01-21T01:15:00.000Z	mwe	Gizmo_The_Great	it does if you don't tell it not to
2008-01-21T01:15:00.000Z	Gizmo_The_Great	mwe	does it? I thought it didn't
2008-01-21T01:15:00.000Z	mwe	Gizmo_The_Great	you can make your files "private" in windows terms
2008-01-21T01:16:00.000Z	Gizmo_The_Great	mwe	oh yeah - you're right. I remember now
2008-01-21T01:25:00.000Z	mwe	Gizmo_The_Great	well if samba has read access to your files you can share them even though local users cant access them
2008-01-21T01:26:00.000Z	mwe	Gizmo_The_Great	as a side note for our previous conversation
2008-01-21T01:27:00.000Z	Gizmo_The_Great	mwe	thanks nwe. I'm on a different 'concern' now though. I've just migrated from one PC to another and trying to replicate shares that I had on the old machine. Nothing to do with out earlier chat about users home folders :-)
