2009-04-01T17:37:00.000Z	Kahlil		Could someone tell me if Ubuntu comes with the necessary drivers to run "GeForce GTX 295 1792MB" video card on a 64 bit system?
2009-04-01T17:37:00.000Z	ziroday	Kahlil	what version of ubuntu?
2009-04-01T17:38:00.000Z	ziroday	Kahlil	if you have intrepid you should be good
2009-04-01T17:40:00.000Z	ziroday	Kahlil	see http://www.nvidia.com/object/linux_display_amd64_180.44.html that driver is in intrepid
2009-04-01T17:40:00.000Z	ziroday	Kahlil	I got that from http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us, you are in doubt you should contact nvidia support
2009-04-01T17:41:00.000Z	Kahlil	ziroday	yea, the GFX 295 is not listed there :-/
2009-04-01T17:42:00.000Z	Kahlil	ziroday	it is listed under http://www.nvidia.com/object/linux_display_ia32_180.22.html but thats not a 64 bit driver is it?
2009-04-01T17:42:00.000Z	ziroday	Kahlil	sorry, I didn't make myself clear. If you go to http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us and select your card it will say that driver supports it
2009-04-01T17:43:00.000Z	ziroday	Kahlil	support for your card was added in -180.22, its currently at -180.44. If it doesn't work in intrepid it will work in jaunty
2009-04-01T17:43:00.000Z	Kahlil	ziroday	Ahh i see, i didnt see it on the list, but that was under "added support for the following GPUs" my mistake
2009-04-01T17:44:00.000Z	ziroday	Kahlil	but short story, if it doesn't work in intrepid it will work in jaunty
2009-04-01T17:44:00.000Z	Kahlil	ziroday	jaunty being the upcoming release in 20 or so days?
2009-04-01T17:44:00.000Z	ziroday	Kahlil	yep
2009-04-01T17:45:00.000Z	ziroday	Kahlil	in fact if you gimme a sec I can verify that for you
2009-04-01T17:45:00.000Z	Kahlil	ziroday	thank you very much, greatly appreciated
2009-04-01T17:45:00.000Z	Kahlil	ziroday	thank you
2009-04-01T17:46:00.000Z	ziroday	Kahlil	yep, the driver is in jaunty, unfortunately not in intrepid
2009-04-01T17:46:00.000Z	ziroday	Kahlil	however I would imagine it would get backported after jaunty is released
2009-04-01T17:46:00.000Z	Kahlil	ziroday	the beta is still availble to use before the release, if i want to try before that right?
2009-04-01T17:47:00.000Z	ziroday	Kahlil	of course, you can download jaunty now if you so wish
2009-04-01T17:48:00.000Z	Kahlil	ziroday	so all in all i should be fine purchasing this graphics card and trying ubuntu? :)
2009-04-01T17:48:00.000Z	ziroday	Kahlil	correct
2009-04-01T17:48:00.000Z	ziroday	Kahlil	I know how worrying it is building your machine :)
2009-04-01T17:49:00.000Z	Kahlil	ziroday	yea, and i have been using mac for about 4 years, so much new stuff to look at!
