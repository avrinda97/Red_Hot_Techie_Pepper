2006-03-13T07:43:00.000Z	randabis	cory	sorry
2006-03-13T07:43:00.000Z	randabis		I meant /msg
2006-03-13T07:45:00.000Z	cory	randabis	sorry for my dumbness, I am coming from Gentoo and learning a lot lately.
2006-03-13T07:46:00.000Z	randabis		i broke windows by installing windows xp 64-bit on a seperate partition...lol I ended up wiping xp 64 and putting dapper back on that partition
2006-03-13T07:46:00.000Z	randabis		i haven't been able to fix windows yet though :/
2006-03-13T07:48:00.000Z	cory	randabis	a tab came up, but it says that the connection was broken.
2006-03-13T07:48:00.000Z	randabis	cory	try /msg randabis test
2006-03-13T08:08:00.000Z	cory		hello, I crashed.
2006-03-13T08:09:00.000Z	cory		WostPhopia: yeah, try Gentoo
2006-03-13T08:13:00.000Z	cory		I love Gentoo, but when it breaks and I gotta spend time fixing it that I need to do work stuff, Gentoo sucks (I still like it)
2006-03-13T08:13:00.000Z	randabis		i don't like gentoo because of portage
2006-03-13T08:13:00.000Z	randabis		apt > portage imho
2006-03-13T08:14:00.000Z	cory		<randabis>: portage is great
2006-03-13T08:15:00.000Z	cory		randais: the best thing gong for Gentoo is Portage
2006-03-13T08:16:00.000Z	randabis	cory	meh, to each his own. The maintainers of the packages in portage are my main beef
