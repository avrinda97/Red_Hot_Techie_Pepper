2007-02-16T17:00:00.000Z	Absenth		kernel Panic is nearly the same as a BSOD
2007-02-16T17:00:00.000Z	Absenth		what they said.
2007-02-16T17:00:00.000Z	adaptr	Absenth	erm... not nearly
2007-02-16T17:01:00.000Z	Absenth	adaptr	for a NON coder/hacker it's close enough.
2007-02-17T17:01:00.000Z	adaptr	Absenth	true.. close enough, *in wintendo terms*.. it's still miseducation
2007-02-17T17:03:00.000Z	adaptr	Absenth	100%, basically.. it'll only have gottten better, not worse...
2007-02-17T17:03:00.000Z	Absenth	adaptr	perfect,  I suspected as much, but some times packages change, are removed, or replaced.
2007-02-17T17:04:00.000Z	adaptr	Absenth	well, as long as the method used is the same, I don';t see why it would be any different
2007-02-17T17:04:00.000Z	Absenth	adaptr	I'm going to give it a shot on my notebook tonight.
2007-02-17T17:05:00.000Z	adaptr	Absenth	unless you use STR a lot, I would just scramble swap on shutdown
2007-02-17T17:05:00.000Z	adaptr	Absenth	an encrypted swap would be a serious performance hit on a laptop
2007-02-17T17:06:00.000Z	Absenth	adaptr	mostly screwing around with it.  with 1gb of ram it may not be quite as bad, but point taken.
2007-02-17T17:15:00.000Z	Absenth	adaptr	cc2k: there was an article in a magazine I just read this week that discussed recovering deleted files.  although it might have been specific to mysql and dropped tables.  *goes looking for the magazine*
2007-02-17T17:16:00.000Z	adaptr	Absenth	basically, with ext2|3 or any othe rmainstream Linux FS, you can't - any "solution" will be a nasty hack that is never guaranteed to recover anything
2007-02-17T17:17:00.000Z	Absenth	adaptr	yeah, I found the article I was talking about.  It's in the Feb. Linux Journal.  "Tech Tips with Gnull and Voyd"  but it's specific to dropped MySQL tables, and not filesystem deletions.
2007-02-17T17:17:00.000Z	adaptr	Absenth	urm
2007-02-17T17:17:00.000Z	Absenth	adaptr	ie, I was mistaken :)
2007-02-17T17:18:00.000Z	adaptr	Absenth	I know, it's not even in the same universe...
2007-02-17T17:19:00.000Z	adaptr	Absenth	is Reiser out of prison, then ?
2007-02-17T17:20:00.000Z	Absenth	adaptr	the developer being in prison is a reason not to include support for the file system?  and to answer your question I hae no idea.
2007-02-17T17:21:00.000Z	adaptr	Absenth	I had no idea it was fully stable yet... from your question I deduced that reiser4 would need to be finished before inclusion ?
2007-02-17T17:23:00.000Z	Absenth	adaptr	a quick search of the oracle makes it look as if Reiser4 is released.  but not merged into the mainline linux kernel.
2007-02-17T17:23:00.000Z	Absenth	adaptr	*shrug* i guess it doesn't really matter :)
2007-02-17T17:24:00.000Z	adaptr	Absenth	oh, i see.. well, I understand that there were serious stability issues with early releases
