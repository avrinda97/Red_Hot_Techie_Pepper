2006-02-25T14:34:00.000Z	jbmagic		hi all
2006-02-25T14:35:00.000Z	jbmagic		is ubuntu easy to use?
2006-02-25T14:35:00.000Z	jbmagic		easier than gentoo?
2006-02-25T14:36:00.000Z	jbmagic		seems like ubunti is a great linux distro i am going to try out
2006-02-25T14:36:00.000Z	jbmagic		can i instal lubuntu with the live cd? or better to get the .iso one?
2006-02-25T14:36:00.000Z	Seveas	jbmagic	no you cannot install from live cd yet
2006-02-25T14:37:00.000Z	jbmagic	Seveas	oce i get the iso file and download and install it...will i ever need to do it again when new updates version of ubuntu comes out?
2006-02-25T14:38:00.000Z	Seveas	jbmagic	no
2006-02-25T14:39:00.000Z	Seveas	jbmagic	no
2006-02-25T14:40:00.000Z	jbmagic	Seveas	when i install the full version of ubantu do i need to be online when its installing?
2006-02-25T14:40:00.000Z	Seveas	jbmagic	no
2006-02-25T14:40:00.000Z	jbmagic	Seveas	 just need to be online to update it after installation right?
2006-02-25T14:40:00.000Z	Seveas	jbmagic	100% correct
2006-02-25T14:42:00.000Z	Seveas	jbmagic	there are 2 options: a full desktop and a lean base system that does not even install X
2006-02-25T14:43:00.000Z	jbmagic	Seveas	 which one you recommend
2006-02-25T14:43:00.000Z	Seveas	jbmagic	depends on your linux skill and your needs
2006-02-25T14:43:00.000Z	Seveas	jbmagic	not during install, during install you have only those 2 options
2006-02-25T14:44:00.000Z	Seveas	jbmagic	not if you uninstall correctly (and debfoster can help you clean up the remaining bits)
2006-02-25T14:48:00.000Z	Seveas	jbmagic	apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade (or use the 'smart upgrade' in the graphical package manager)
2006-02-25T14:48:00.000Z	Seveas	jbmagic	insanely easy
2006-02-25T14:49:00.000Z	Seveas	jbmagic	if you want to sacrifice your whole disk to Ubuntu it'll do it automagically
2006-02-25T14:50:00.000Z	jbmagic	Seveas	 the installation walkthru is easy when installing ubuntu?
2006-02-25T14:50:00.000Z	Seveas	jbmagic	yes
2006-02-25T14:52:00.000Z	Seveas	jbmagic	not if you don't have another pc for irc - during install you can do nothing but watch the installer
