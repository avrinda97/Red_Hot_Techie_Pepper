2011-09-27T06:25:00.000Z	ikonia	Gr3mlin	nope, just ask
2011-09-27T06:28:00.000Z	ikonia	Gr3mlin	you can either use "nohup" on the command, or use a tool like screen
2011-09-27T06:28:00.000Z	ikonia	Gr3mlin	are you aware of either ?
2011-09-27T06:29:00.000Z	Gr3mlin	ikonia	nope! :( im rather new to the headless server side of things.
2011-09-27T06:29:00.000Z	ikonia	Gr3mlin	what sort of thing are you trying to run/keep running

2011-09-27T06:30:00.000Z	ikonia	Gr3mlin	pros/cons to both
2011-09-27T06:35:00.000Z	Gr3mlin	ikonia	thanks, i think i'll look at screen nohup doesnt really let you watch whats going on asfar as i can see.
2011-09-27T06:35:00.000Z	ikonia	Gr3mlin	it does, it outputs to a file called nohup.ou
2011-09-27T06:35:00.000Z	ikonia	Gr3mlin	it does, it outputs to a file called nohup.out
2011-09-27T06:36:00.000Z	Gr3mlin	ikonia	i saw that, i ment, i can login, and execute a command on the running server.
2011-09-27T06:36:00.000Z	ikonia	Gr3mlin	whatever works best for you, that's the best way to do it

2011-09-27T06:39:00.000Z	ikonia	Gr3mlin	you can manually configure it, it's a little more complex though
2011-09-27T06:57:00.000Z	Gr3mlin	ikonia	is there a way to connect back into the running screen ap?
2011-09-27T06:57:00.000Z	ikonia	Gr3mlin	screen -r
