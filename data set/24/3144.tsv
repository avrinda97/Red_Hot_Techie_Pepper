2008-04-22T03:51:00.000Z	name10135		Okaaaay..  I cannot install Ubuntu 7.10 w/ a live CD (the loader stalls after not being able to find graphics drivers), attempted a alt-cd install w/ help here, and the install destroyed the windows boot on a separate partition.  I still require help setting up the partitioning via the alt-cd installer.
2008-04-22T03:52:00.000Z	bazhang	name10135	are you going to install windows again; if so best do it first
2008-04-22T03:53:00.000Z	name10135	bazhang	Already did, need help walking through how to setup a dual boot install.
2008-04-22T03:53:00.000Z	bazhang	name10135	the live cd does not work? what errors are you getting
2008-04-22T03:54:00.000Z	bazhang	name10135	then use the guided
2008-04-22T03:55:00.000Z	name10135	bazhang	Via "Guided - resisze SCSI1 (0,0,0), partition #1....."  That option will not destroy the windows partition?
2008-04-22T03:56:00.000Z	bazhang	name10135	what do you mean install guided will destroy the windows partition; that does not sound right
2008-04-22T03:57:00.000Z	bazhang	name10135	the guided can simply resize your windows partition, not destroy it
2008-04-22T04:00:00.000Z	name10135	bazhang	I have 1 partition, and empty space.  Guided options include resising partition #1 and installing on that partition, all other guided options reformat the entire HDD, manual seems to be the only option to setup an install without destroying the partition w/ windows setup
2008-04-22T04:01:00.000Z	bazhang	name10135	the guided resize is the safest; how big is this drive and how much for ubuntu
2008-04-22T04:03:00.000Z	name10135	bazhang	160GB, 15gb win, 20gb ubuntu.  I don't understand that guided option.  It will resise the #1 partition & install linux.  The #1 partition is where windows is loaded, so how can that option work without erasing windows?
2008-04-22T04:04:00.000Z	bazhang	name10135	back up important data and trust in ubuntu--that option has been around a long time and used by countless folks, myself included, with nary a mishap
2008-04-22T04:18:00.000Z	name10135	bazhang	Hey, went w/ guided, and I encountered the SAME installation error.
2008-04-22T04:18:00.000Z	bazhang	name10135	what was the error please specify
2008-04-22T04:20:00.000Z	bazhang	name10135	and that destroyed your windows partition?
2008-04-22T04:21:00.000Z	name10135	bazhang	Trying to boot normally into windows now....
2008-04-22T04:22:00.000Z	name10135	bazhang	So yeah, now windows will not boot
2008-04-22T04:23:00.000Z	bazhang	name10135	how far along in the install process for ubuntu did you get--approx how many minutes
2008-04-22T04:24:00.000Z	name10135	bazhang	It wasn't able to install the base system.  Probably a minute or so.  This is a Core 2 Duo 2.4Ghz system
2008-04-22T04:26:00.000Z	bazhang	name10135	and you checked the md5sum for that iso?
2008-04-22T04:27:00.000Z	name10135	bazhang	I have 0 experience w/ linux.  You would have to tell me how to check that md5sum.
2008-04-22T04:27:00.000Z	bazhang	name10135	the live cd boots okay; or were you in the alternate cd
2008-04-22T04:29:00.000Z	name10135	bazhang	 As I said earlier, I *have* to use the alt-CD because the laptop I'm attempting to install onto is only weeks old, and the graphics drivers do not work w/ LiveCD, the installer stalls after informing that it has to continue in low-graphics mode.
2008-04-22T04:36:00.000Z	name10135	bazhang	Well thankyou.  Now I have to wait another 3 hours to reinstall windows on my notebook.  It's experiences like these that really inspire me to continue to attempt to use linux.  Good-bye.
