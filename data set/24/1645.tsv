2010-05-19T14:29:00.000Z	janjiss	linduxed	I wrote whole problem a while ago but no one answered ,so I tried minimalistic variant :D
2010-05-19T14:30:00.000Z	linduxed	janjiss	hmm, i can't say i know what it could be
2010-05-19T14:31:00.000Z	janjiss	linduxed	I gusess it cant be ufw?
2010-05-19T14:31:00.000Z	linduxed	janjiss	i don't think so, since it got a job
2010-05-19T14:32:00.000Z	linduxed	janjiss	did it get the correct job?
2010-05-19T14:32:00.000Z	janjiss	linduxed	Yes, it has correct  job in quanue. It shows, that it has finished printind, but nothing happens. It works fine with ubuntu network
2010-05-19T14:34:00.000Z	linduxed	janjiss	it sounds as if the data is misunderstood
2010-05-19T14:35:00.000Z	linduxed	janjiss	as in "oh there's nothing in this job, i'm finished then"
2010-05-19T14:35:00.000Z	janjiss	linduxed	I could not disagree :)
2010-05-19T14:35:00.000Z	linduxed	janjiss	or well, it could be that way
2010-05-19T14:36:00.000Z	linduxed	janjiss	i think this is a compatibility error, maybe the driver on the XP side is incorrect
2010-05-19T14:36:00.000Z	janjiss	linduxed	I just wish it woudl be so easy to connect from xp as it is easy to connect to ubuntu :)
2010-05-19T14:36:00.000Z	linduxed	janjiss	but my guesses end there
2010-05-19T14:36:00.000Z	janjiss	linduxed	Driver is form HP homepage
2010-05-19T14:36:00.000Z	linduxed	janjiss	well good luck with that, call microsoft and complain...
2010-05-19T14:37:00.000Z	janjiss	linduxed	Thats hilarious :D
