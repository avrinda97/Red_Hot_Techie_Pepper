2009-02-24T06:13:00.000Z	Iceman_B^Ltop		is it possible to change permissions on a samba share from windows if the share is hosted on Ubuntu ?
2009-02-24T06:13:00.000Z	Iceman_B^Ltop		*from within
2009-02-24T06:14:00.000Z	_VIM_	Iceman_B^Ltop	I would just ssh into the linux box and set the permissions
2009-02-24T06:14:00.000Z	_VIM_		!ssh
2009-02-24T06:15:00.000Z	_VIM_		?
2009-02-24T06:15:00.000Z	_VIM_		again? AETE_KRAOUD?
2009-02-24T06:15:00.000Z	_VIM_		hmmm there's always google cache or waybackmachine
2009-02-24T06:16:00.000Z	Iceman_B^Ltop	_VIM_	of course, but I want to make sure that there is 0,0 possibility from within windows, so that none of my housemates can break stuff
2009-02-24T06:16:00.000Z	_VIM_	Iceman_B^Ltop	well in that situation you'll just have to change the pass every week or so
2009-02-24T06:17:00.000Z	_VIM_		ok AETE_KRAOUD :)
2009-02-24T06:18:00.000Z	Iceman_B^Ltop		also, I'd like to know if the password and user I set via smbpasswd utility needs to match ANY user I have created either in Linux, or any of the usernames from connecting WinXP boxes.
2009-02-24T06:18:00.000Z	_VIM_		gpg --import <file>
2009-02-24T06:18:00.000Z	_VIM_		i think.
2009-02-24T06:18:00.000Z	Iceman_B^Ltop		Ive found that WinXP gives you the option to specify a username and pass when you mount the share as a networkd drive
2009-02-24T06:20:00.000Z	_VIM_	Iceman_B^Ltop	that I don't know for sure, but you could always try keepassx, it's a really nice password manager, very advanced for the price (Free) :)  you can export passwords as databases and stick them on usb sticks and whatnot ...
2009-02-24T06:21:00.000Z	Iceman_B^Ltop		im using keepass
2009-02-24T06:21:00.000Z	_VIM_		and there's a windows keepass too
2009-02-24T06:21:00.000Z	_VIM_		ah
2009-02-24T06:21:00.000Z	Iceman_B^Ltop		but thats what what I meant
2009-02-24T06:21:00.000Z	Iceman_B^Ltop		*not
2009-02-24T06:21:00.000Z	Iceman_B^Ltop		I meant, when I am configuring my smb.conf file and creating users
2009-02-24T06:21:00.000Z	_VIM_		yeah i know Iceman_B^Ltop. Sorry couldn't be of more assistance on that
2009-02-24T06:21:00.000Z	_VIM_		keep asking :)
2009-02-24T06:22:00.000Z	Iceman_B^Ltop	_VIM_	hehe, no prob
