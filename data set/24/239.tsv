2012-02-14T14:44:00.000Z	phix	eona3	oh noes
2012-02-14T14:44:00.000Z	phix	eona3	CTRL+ALT+F1 do anything when it boots up?
2012-02-14T14:55:00.000Z	phix	eona3	What was the question?
2012-02-14T14:55:00.000Z	eona3	phix	How should I proceed?
2012-02-14T14:56:00.000Z	phix	eona3	with what?
2012-02-14T14:56:00.000Z	eona3	phix	it installed the boot loader to the second Truecrypt drive and it wont boot on the primary drive I told it to install on. How should I recover? thx
2012-02-14T14:57:00.000Z	phix	eona3	why are you trying to use trucrypt for ubuntu?  use LUKS (which comes with ubuntu)
2012-02-14T14:57:00.000Z	eona3	phix	ok, how should I get it to boot though
2012-02-14T14:57:00.000Z	phix	eona3	it just boots
2012-02-14T14:58:00.000Z	eona3	phix	whats the easisest way to do that?
2012-02-14T14:58:00.000Z	phix	eona3	There are docs on the ubuntu site that explains how to do this, I recommend you read them
2012-02-14T14:58:00.000Z	eona3	phix	thanks...
2012-02-14T14:58:00.000Z	phix	eona3	The easiest way is to spend 5 - 10 minutes reading the docs
2012-02-14T14:59:00.000Z	eona3	phix	any chance I can recover the second HDD that has Truecrypt that it installed on?
2012-02-14T14:59:00.000Z	phix	eona3	you basically boot from CD, go through the setup, then in the disc manager you choose a partition to set as encryption drive, you need to use the alternate or server ubuntu CD, you cant do this with the esktop CD
2012-02-14T14:59:00.000Z	phix	eona3	no idea
2012-02-14T15:00:00.000Z	eona3	phix	not trying to be rude but why on earth does it install the bootloader on the opposite HDD it is told to install on?
2012-02-14T15:01:00.000Z	phix	eona3	It installs on the disc you tell it to install on
2012-02-14T15:05:00.000Z	phix	eona3	/dev/sda?
2012-02-14T15:06:00.000Z	eona3	phix	sorry I'm not sure what you're asking
2012-02-14T15:06:00.000Z	eona3	phix	I went through the GUI install of Ubuntu 11.10 and told it to install on HDD0, and it did, but installed the Ubuntu bootloader, not Grub, on HDD1...
2012-02-14T15:09:00.000Z	eona3	phix	I mean I'm trying to implement Ubuntu in a busniess medium network envirnoment. Will I need to physically take all of the HDDs out of the PC except for one?
2012-02-14T15:10:00.000Z	eona3	phix	How do I prevent this from happening in the future?
