2009-08-31T03:34:00.000Z	gustavonarea		Hello. How can I install the "NVIDIA Accelerated graphics driver  (version 180)" from the command line? I cannot do it via the "Restricted Drivers" GUI because the window is bigger than the screen
2009-08-31T03:34:00.000Z	JohnCorbeau	gustavonarea	did you already download them?
2009-08-31T03:35:00.000Z	gustavonarea	JohnCorbeau	I don't think so. (Just in case, I just want to install it from the .deb in the official repos)
2009-08-31T03:35:00.000Z	JohnCorbeau	gustavonarea	first download them from the nvidia website
2009-08-31T03:35:00.000Z	JohnCorbeau		ah ok
2009-08-31T03:36:00.000Z	JohnCorbeau	gustavonarea	then you don't want my answer ;)
2009-08-31T03:36:00.000Z	JohnCorbeau	gustavonarea	why only the ubuntu repos?
2009-08-31T03:37:00.000Z	JohnCorbeau	gustavonarea	in a console, type "apt-cache search nvidia"
2009-08-31T03:37:00.000Z	gustavonarea	JohnCorbeau	Because I haven't had any problem with the official .debs. If ain't broken, don't fix it ;-)
2009-08-31T03:37:00.000Z	JohnCorbeau	gustavonarea	then take note of the name that you are interested in
2009-08-31T03:38:00.000Z	JohnCorbeau	gustavonarea	lol you're right. You certainly don't want the development files though.
2009-08-31T03:38:00.000Z	JohnCorbeau	gustavonarea	then "apt-get install my_drivers"
2009-08-31T03:39:00.000Z	gustavonarea	JohnCorbeau	I already did that, but there are several packages (and one of them is installed). Here's the output: http://pastebin.com/fe787663
2009-08-31T03:39:00.000Z	JohnCorbeau	gustavonarea	replace my_drivers obviously
2009-08-31T03:40:00.000Z	gustavonarea	JohnCorbeau	Which of them should I install?
2009-08-31T03:40:00.000Z	gustavonarea	JohnCorbeau	nvidia-glx-180 seems to be the one, but I'm not sure
2009-08-31T03:41:00.000Z	JohnCorbeau	gustavonarea	I guess the installed one is modalias, I would assume the one you need is p   nvidia-glx-180
2009-08-31T03:41:00.000Z	gustavonarea	JohnCorbeau	OK, thank you. I'm going to install it! :)
2009-08-31T03:41:00.000Z	JohnCorbeau	gustavonarea	you can do "apt-cache show my_package" to get information about my_package
2009-08-31T03:42:00.000Z	JohnCorbeau	gustavonarea	ok, have fun, hope it works
2009-08-31T03:42:00.000Z	JohnCorbeau	gustavonarea	by the way, are you sure these are the drivers you need? did you do a little research first?
2009-08-31T03:43:00.000Z	gustavonarea	JohnCorbeau	Yes, that's the package suggested by the Restricted Drivers app. I couldn't installed with it because the current resolution is 640x480 and this program is bigger, so I couldn't click "enable"
2009-08-31T03:45:00.000Z	JohnCorbeau	gustavonarea	ok, just asking because in my case the ubuntu app suggested one that wasn't up-to-date and made my system crash until I reconfigure xorg.conf
2009-08-31T03:45:00.000Z	JohnCorbeau	gustavonarea	that's why I use a nvidia driver..
