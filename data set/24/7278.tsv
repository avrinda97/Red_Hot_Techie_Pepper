2005-02-22T07:39:00.000Z	jblack	liam	That can be, yes. If ACPI tells the kernel that the machine is about to melt down, the kernel will halt the machine.

2005-02-22T07:44:00.000Z	jblack	liam	That means I hook a monitor up to my laptop, and extend my screen onto that extra monitor.
2005-02-22T07:46:00.000Z	jblack	liam	That's plenty for most people.
2005-02-22T07:47:00.000Z	liam	jblack	which is plenty? the 1024x768? or my other crappy monitor that is 800x600 and 13 inches?
