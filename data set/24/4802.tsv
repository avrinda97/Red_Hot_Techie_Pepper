2007-02-05T12:30:00.000Z	MystaMax		hello, Whats the correct syntax for adding a resolution to xorg.conf? All Display subsections only have 1440x900, but I need to add 1280x1024 for external monitor?
2007-02-05T12:30:00.000Z	juano__	MystaMax	just add it the way the others are in there
2007-02-05T12:31:00.000Z	juano__	MystaMax	beside the other ones
2007-02-05T12:32:00.000Z	MystaMax	juano__	so do I add another subsection? or should it be Modes "1440x900" "1280x1024"
2007-02-05T12:32:00.000Z	juano__	MystaMax	i believe you have to put it near the other ones yes, not another subsection
2007-02-05T12:33:00.000Z	MystaMax	juano__	ok, I'll back it up first and try it. Thanks.
2007-02-05T12:33:00.000Z	juano__	MystaMax	just add "1280x1024" next to the other resolutions you have there
2007-02-05T12:33:00.000Z	juano__	MystaMax	yes of course, sudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf  /etc/X11/xorg.conf.bak
2007-02-05T12:43:00.000Z	MystaMax	juano__	no luck. I'm trying to get my dell laptop to boot up on a docking station, which has a 1280x1024 LCD attached to it. It working on Dapper, but not edgy. any ideas?
2007-02-05T12:44:00.000Z	juano__	MystaMax	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg   could do the trick
2007-02-05T12:45:00.000Z	MystaMax	juano__	ok, I'll try it, brb
2007-02-05T13:28:00.000Z	MystaMax	juano__	that didn't work. xServer crashed, and I had to restore the old .conf file. Could it be b/c I have the binary installed, and not nvidia-glx?
2007-02-05T13:30:00.000Z	juano__	MystaMax	mm, are you sure the syntax is right ?
2007-02-05T13:30:00.000Z	juano__	MystaMax	pastebin your xorg.conf contents please
2007-02-05T13:32:00.000Z	MystaMax	juano__	ok gotta get that computer on the network
2007-02-05T13:33:00.000Z	juano__	MystaMax	maybe easier if you got a USB stick
2007-02-05T13:37:00.000Z	MystaMax	juano__	did you see the link to my pastebin of my xorg.conf file?
2007-02-05T13:37:00.000Z	juano__	MystaMax	yes
2007-02-05T13:38:00.000Z	MystaMax	juano__	ook, sorry...
2007-02-05T13:38:00.000Z	juano__	MystaMax	is this your working one or your not working one ?
2007-02-05T13:38:00.000Z	MystaMax	juano__	the working one
2007-02-05T13:38:00.000Z	MystaMax	juano__	i also noticed that 3d screensavers are extremely slow
2007-02-05T13:39:00.000Z	juano__	MystaMax	try changing "nv" to "nvidia" in the Driver section
2007-02-05T14:38:00.000Z	MystaMax	juano__	any ideas?
