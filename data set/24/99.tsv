2012-07-24T21:18:00.000Z	collincday		hi there, im on ubuntu 12.04 desktop - i just installed via the GUI installer and everything went fine, but when I try to boot now i get a flickering screen that all off-center. im running a radeon 6850 but i also have an i3 with integrated gfx that im not using. i was wondering if anyone could help me out?
2012-07-24T21:19:00.000Z	MorpheusChalice	collincday	you must install the proprietary drivers.
2012-07-24T21:19:00.000Z	MorpheusChalice		And also, use the fix splash script for Plymouth.
2012-07-24T21:19:00.000Z	MorpheusChalice		Regarding the script, packages.ubuntu.com/lucid/gnome-accessibility could help you collincday.
2012-07-24T21:22:00.000Z	collincday	MorpheusChalice	Thanks. So I can install the drivers through the recovery boot option?
2012-07-24T21:22:00.000Z	MorpheusChalice	collincday	not really.
2012-07-24T21:22:00.000Z	MorpheusChalice	collincday	you can install the drivers while still in a desktop environment.
2012-07-24T21:22:00.000Z	MorpheusChalice		Like unity or gnome3.
2012-07-24T21:23:00.000Z	MorpheusChalice		You can find it in Settings > Additional Driver
2012-07-24T21:23:00.000Z	collincday		I cant get to that thouogh
2012-07-24T21:23:00.000Z	collincday		*though
2012-07-24T21:23:00.000Z	MorpheusChalice		It'll automatically detect devices that might need a driver.
2012-07-24T21:23:00.000Z	MorpheusChalice	collincday	well, I suggest you drop to recovery mode.
2012-07-24T21:24:00.000Z	collincday		Okay thanks Ill try that.
2012-07-24T21:24:00.000Z	MorpheusChalice	collincday	try http://mygeekopinions.blogspot.in/2011/06/how-to-install-atiamd-catalyst-linux.html
2012-07-24T21:24:00.000Z	MorpheusChalice		That should help.
2012-07-24T21:25:00.000Z	MorpheusChalice		Geez. -.-
2012-07-24T21:25:00.000Z	collincday		What was that splash fix thing you mentioned?
2012-07-24T21:25:00.000Z	MorpheusChalice		Also, collincday, you might need to run the script to fix plymouth.
2012-07-24T21:25:00.000Z	MorpheusChalice	collincday	not really.
2012-07-24T21:25:00.000Z	MorpheusChalice		http://mygeekopinions.blogspot.in/2011/06/how-to-install-atiamd-catalyst-linux.html is the link to installing driver from recovery mode.
2012-07-24T21:25:00.000Z	MorpheusChalice		While http://mygeekopinions.blogspot.in/2011/06/how-to-install-atiamd-catalyst-linux.html is the guide to fixing plymouth after driver installation for graphics.
2012-07-24T21:26:00.000Z	collincday		Ok thanks
