2009-04-28T17:08:00.000Z	grawity	stratovarius	Usually, there are two parts. 1) Start Vidalia. 2) Configure the applications you want to "anonymize" (Firefox for example)
2009-04-28T17:08:00.000Z	stratovarius	grawity	vidalia onion is green, i have torbutton for firefox too but when i turn it on no page will open
2009-04-28T17:09:00.000Z	stratovarius	grawity	i'd like to anonymize firefox
2009-04-28T17:09:00.000Z	grawity	stratovarius	Does it say "Timed out" or "Connection refused" or something else?
2009-04-28T17:10:00.000Z	stratovarius	grawity	firefox now says e to add an exception
2009-04-28T17:10:00.000Z	stratovarius	grawity	tell me if my english is not clear...im italian =)
2009-04-28T17:10:00.000Z	grawity	stratovarius	What address you're trying to open?
2009-04-28T17:11:00.000Z	stratovarius	grawity	google...but the problem is with every site...my router one too
2009-04-28T17:11:00.000Z	grawity	stratovarius	All sites ask to add an exception?
2009-04-28T17:11:00.000Z	stratovarius	grawity	yes
2009-04-28T17:12:00.000Z	grawity	stratovarius	Even non-SSL ones? (without https://)
2009-04-28T17:12:00.000Z	stratovarius	grawity	may u give me an exemple?
2009-04-28T17:13:00.000Z	grawity	stratovarius	http://www.google.com/
2009-04-28T17:13:00.000Z	grawity	stratovarius	That one really should _not_ ask for an exception :/
2009-04-28T17:16:00.000Z	stratovarius	grawity	may we control torbutton and vidalia parameters or something else?
2009-04-28T17:17:00.000Z	grawity	stratovarius	Hmm, check your proxy settings -- they should look like this http://sine.cluenet.org/~grawity/dump/firefox-socks-config.png -- except for the SOCKS port!
2009-04-28T17:18:00.000Z	stratovarius	grawity	now if i try to open last link u gave me firefox says me connection refused by proxy server
2009-04-28T17:19:00.000Z	grawity	stratovarius	Ah, hmm. Then: Manual configuration, HTTP/SSL/FTP/Gopher proxy EMPTY.
2009-04-28T17:19:00.000Z	stratovarius	grawity	what? i dont understand
2009-04-28T17:20:00.000Z	stratovarius	grawity	manual configuration in torbutton, proxy configuration in firefox or in vidalia?
