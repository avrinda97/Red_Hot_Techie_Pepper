2005-10-16T08:28:00.000Z	tritium	n0odl3	see the topic
2005-10-16T08:30:00.000Z	tritium	n0odl3	it's in your path.  Just type gcc...
2005-10-16T08:50:00.000Z	tritium	n0odl3	if you upgrade, those package don't just vanish
2005-10-16T08:53:00.000Z	tritium	n0odl3	in unofficial repositories, since it's not legal to distribute
2005-10-16T08:54:00.000Z	tritium	n0odl3	yeah, one of those unofficial sites
2005-10-17T10:16:00.000Z	tritium	n0odl3	read the wiki page on ATI
2005-10-18T09:37:00.000Z	tritium	n0odl3	dpkg -L <packagename> to list files in the package
2005-10-18T09:42:00.000Z	tritium	n0odl3	see my last message to you
2005-10-18T09:42:00.000Z	tritium	n0odl3	just use the package name, not the full file name
2005-10-18T09:44:00.000Z	tritium	n0odl3	e.g., filename = firefox_1.0.7-0ubuntu20_i386.deb, but packagename = firefox
2005-10-18T09:45:00.000Z	tritium	n0odl3	so if it's installed, you can list the files
2005-10-18T09:47:00.000Z	tritium	n0odl3	with dpkg -L <packagename>, like I told you
2005-10-18T09:48:00.000Z	tritium	n0odl3	are you using just the packagename, and not the full filename?
2005-10-18T09:49:00.000Z	tritium	n0odl3	what are you putting as the packagename?
