2005-11-19T17:04:00.000Z	soundray	xxMEL0Nxx	there is no way to tell in advance.
2005-11-19T17:06:00.000Z	soundray	xxMEL0Nxx	what's the problem?
2005-11-19T17:08:00.000Z	soundray	xxMEL0Nxx	so you have a printer physically connected to a desktop?
2005-11-19T17:09:00.000Z	soundray	xxMEL0Nxx	and you can print from the desktop?
2005-11-19T17:09:00.000Z	soundray	xxMEL0Nxx	just checking.
2005-11-19T17:10:00.000Z	soundray	xxMEL0Nxx	have you set up the printer on the laptop via System - Admin. - Printing?
2005-11-19T17:11:00.000Z	soundray	xxMEL0Nxx	which one and why?
2005-11-19T17:13:00.000Z	soundray	xxMEL0Nxx	can you point me to that FAQ pls.
2005-11-19T17:15:00.000Z	soundray	xxMEL0Nxx	you made those changes on the desktop?
2005-11-19T17:16:00.000Z	soundray	xxMEL0Nxx	have you looked at the files in /var/log/cups ?
2005-11-19T17:20:00.000Z	soundray	xxMEL0Nxx	sounds like you were printing an empty file
2005-11-19T17:20:00.000Z	soundray	xxMEL0Nxx	or like you were using the wrong driver on the client.
2005-11-19T17:22:00.000Z	soundray	xxMEL0Nxx	when you test, do you use the "print test page" button?
2005-11-19T17:23:00.000Z	soundray	xxMEL0Nxx	do you see all those tests in the job queue?
2005-11-19T17:25:00.000Z	soundray	xxMEL0Nxx	I mean the "Jobs" item in the printer's context menu.
2005-11-19T17:26:00.000Z	soundray	xxMEL0Nxx	can you try setting up a new printer
2005-11-19T17:35:00.000Z	soundray	xxMEL0Nxx	can you select "Generic - Raw" as the driver for the printer you've added.
2005-11-19T17:35:00.000Z	soundray	xxMEL0Nxx	does it work then?
2005-11-19T17:39:00.000Z	soundray	xxMEL0Nxx	try restarting cups on the server.
2005-11-19T17:41:00.000Z	soundray	xxMEL0Nxx	when you've started it, can you confirm that it's running by doing 'ps | grep cupsd' on the server?
2005-11-19T17:41:00.000Z	soundray	xxMEL0Nxx	sorry, ps ax | grep cupsd
