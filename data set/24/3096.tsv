2008-04-30T18:28:00.000Z	luinfana		I've got a question about a Realtek 8139 ethernet card...nothing on the forums has helped
2008-04-30T18:28:00.000Z	luinfana		anyone have any experience with that?
2008-04-30T18:29:00.000Z	luinfana		do we know why?
2008-04-30T18:30:00.000Z	pajamian	luinfana	good luck
2008-04-30T18:28:00.000Z	pajamian	luinfana	that's an old card, yes, but not in ubuntu.  I have had it working in old linux boxes for ages, though.
2008-04-30T18:29:00.000Z	luinfana	pajamian	exactly, exactly. It works on like Mandrake and Slackware but anything Debian has trouble with it (Knoppix, etc)
2008-04-30T18:30:00.000Z	pajamian	luinfana	sorry, i don't.  I would have expected it to "just work".
2008-04-30T18:30:00.000Z	luinfana	pajamian	yeah, me too...it's a shame because it's the only thing keeping me from installing Ubuntu on this computer...Windows has slowed to an unusable crawl
2008-04-30T18:31:00.000Z	luinfana	pajamian	eh, thanks
2008-05-01T07:05:00.000Z	pajamian	luinfana	just out of curiosity, and I don't think this will help, but have you tried manually configuring the IP / netmask / gateway, etc?
2008-05-01T07:05:00.000Z	luinfana	pajamian	yeah, tried manual IP and stuff too
2008-05-01T07:08:00.000Z	pajamian	luinfana	I hate to say this, because I *know* that linux *should* work well with the realtek card, but maybe at the end of the day it's not worth your time to continue to troubleshoot this card over say just running out and buying a different card.
2008-05-01T07:09:00.000Z	luinfana	pajamian	indeed, indeed...I'd just _like_ it to work with this one
2008-05-01T07:09:00.000Z	pajamian	luinfana	I hear ya
2008-05-01T07:11:00.000Z	pajamian	luinfana	just on a hunch, I've been reading some of those links to forum articles and it looks like it may be some problem with a clashing PCI address.  IIRC, differetn addresses get assigned to different PCI slots so it's entirely possible that just moving the card to a different slot will fix the problem.
2008-05-01T07:11:00.000Z	luinfana	pajamian	woah, that actually sounds like a brilliant idea
2008-05-01T07:12:00.000Z	luinfana	pajamian	lemme do some tests here for amenado, then I'll try that
2008-05-01T07:12:00.000Z	pajamian	luinfana	ok, and good luck
2008-05-01T07:12:00.000Z	luinfana	pajamian	thanks!
2008-05-01T07:12:00.000Z	pajamian	luinfana	thank me if it works ;-)
2008-05-01T07:13:00.000Z	luinfana	pajamian	haha, welllll I just realized...it's hardwired to the MB...not gonna be able to move it anywhere :(
2008-05-01T07:14:00.000Z	pajamian	luinfana	ahhh, oh well, look in the CMOS setup, though, it may have an option to change the address in there.
2008-05-01T07:14:00.000Z	luinfana	pajamian	OK
2008-05-01T07:56:00.000Z	pajamian	luinfana	did you try "/etc/init.d/networking restart" after you changed from roaming to dhcp?
