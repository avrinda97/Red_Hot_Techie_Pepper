2009-06-22T11:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nztal	that guide tells you how. i use dnsmasq, its sweet
2009-06-22T11:29:00.000Z	nztal	ActionParsnip	yes i am aware of how to get dnsmasq working its geting /etc/network/interfaces properly defined for a static ip address that i'm having trouble with i need to define a dns-nameserver and it doesn't usually like 127.0.0.1
2009-06-22T11:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nztal	you add it to /etc/resolv.conf
2009-06-22T11:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nztal	the interfaces file doesnt define dns servers
2009-06-22T11:31:00.000Z	nztal	ActionParsnip	yes.  i know thats a part of getting dnsmasq working.  i've already done all that.  what i'm trying to accomplish is remove network-manager-gnome and only rely on a /etc/network/interfaces file for eth0 and wlan0  dnsmasq, resolv.conf etc is configured correctly  its getting my networking completed i'm having issues with
2009-06-22T11:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nztal	thats fine, the interfaces file overrides network manager, if you like you can uninstall it, or simply disable it from showing up by installing and running bum with gksudo and stopping its process
2009-06-22T11:34:00.000Z	nztal	ActionParsnip	a part of /etc/network/interfaces is defining a "dns-nameservers"  at least i'm thinking it won't work if i leave that out and i dont know what to properly put for that entry.
2009-06-22T11:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nztal	heres the interfaces off my fileserver which uses dnsmasq and static IP: http://pastebin.com/f33329620
2009-06-22T11:36:00.000Z	nztal	ActionParsnip	thank you.  i'll adjust broadcast and network, and hope that'll suffice.  thank you
2009-06-22T11:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nztal	i dont know of this dns-nameservice you are on about in the interfaces file
2009-06-22T11:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nztal	the roadcast and network addresses I added for completeness
2009-06-22T11:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nztal	but can be calculated using the address and mask
2009-06-22T11:38:00.000Z	nztal	ActionParsnip	it is here, and i've seen it before, like when i was trying to accomlish nic bonding  http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=318539
2009-06-22T11:39:00.000Z	nztal	ActionParsnip	hopefully its not detrimental
2009-07-18T21:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nztal	there may be a fax appp that uses the x=sane stuff and wil allow you to fax
2009-07-18T21:14:00.000Z	nztal	ActionParsnip	is that done through a fax modem do you know ?  i've no idea what fax modem might work on a modern day desktop.  i would however like fax capability on my ubuntu box, and i was just given a working scanner
2009-07-18T21:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nztal	not sure. i'm sure one will exist somewhere
2009-07-18T21:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nztal	apt-cache search fax | less    will get you started
2009-11-04T03:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nztal	one person's easy is another persno's hard
