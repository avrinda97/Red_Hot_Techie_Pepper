2010-05-10T17:04:00.000Z	red2kic	Vigo	Don't use ecryptfs (or something like that) for home encryption. I think it's hassle.
2010-05-10T17:04:00.000Z	Vigo	red2kic	Thank you, that makes sense.
2010-06-12T10:16:00.000Z	red2kic	Vigo	Yes, metapackages generally are listed in "sudo tasksel"
2010-06-12T10:06:00.000Z	red2kic	Vigo	From there, you won't have any X, you'll have to install packages as you go to meet your desires.
2010-06-12T10:06:00.000Z	Vigo	red2kic	Thank you.
2010-06-12T10:11:00.000Z	Vigo	red2kic	Wowies, that is a 20mb .ISO, do I need one of those tiny CD-Rs or can I use a CD-RW and re use it after install?
2010-06-12T10:12:00.000Z	red2kic	Vigo	Mmm. Do what you want. You even can burn 20BMB onto the dvd.
2010-06-12T10:12:00.000Z	red2kic	Vigo	It's just small, but the latest packages will be retrieved from the Internet.
2010-06-12T10:13:00.000Z	red2kic	Vigo	Just don't use any metapackages (ie ubuntu-desktop, kubuntu-desktop) but ubuntu-minimal should be enabled though.
2010-06-12T10:14:00.000Z	Vigo	red2kic	Okee dokee, Thank you, that is what I wanted, a Net Install doo-hicky, this way I can sorta custom spin it, I think?
2010-06-12T10:15:00.000Z	red2kic	Vigo	Sure. You will want to install gnome-core (if you like Gnome) and gdm and few other packages. It should pull in dependencies and viola!
2010-06-12T10:15:00.000Z	Vigo	red2kic	That is the "and type "sudo tasksel" part?
2010-06-12T10:16:00.000Z	Vigo	red2kic	Thank you kindly.
2010-06-12T10:19:00.000Z	red2kic	Vigo	gnome-core won't pull in bluetooth. You'll have to install them yourself. :)
2010-06-12T10:20:00.000Z	Vigo	red2kic	Okee dokee that is what  I was sorta aiming for, I have a custom spin of 8.04.3, but it is getting tired now.
2010-06-12T10:21:00.000Z	red2kic	Vigo	Nice. :)
2010-06-12T10:23:00.000Z	Vigo	red2kic	niku: So I select gnome-core then spin them in as needed or required?
2010-06-12T10:24:00.000Z	red2kic	Vigo	gnome-core gdm x11-xserver-utils
2010-06-12T10:25:00.000Z	red2kic	Vigo	Then you add what you want, themes and applications.
2010-06-12T10:28:00.000Z	red2kic	Vigo	The same idea can be applied for just about anything. I wanted a media center and nothing else. So I start off with few essential packages then xbmc (popular media center). Eventually I add samba and cups (for printer sharing). Kinda making it my home server + media center. :)
2010-06-12T10:31:00.000Z	Vigo	red2kic	niku: I did the same with Media Ubuntu before it was recognized, and niku, I like those classes, I passed them when they were free back in Dapper Daze. But I thank you kindly for the heads up on it.
2010-06-12T10:41:00.000Z	red2kic	Vigo	Expect problems is all I have to say. Nothing ever go the way you like it.
2010-06-12T10:42:00.000Z	Vigo	red2kic	That is why Backups are made on a rotating  and incremental basis.
