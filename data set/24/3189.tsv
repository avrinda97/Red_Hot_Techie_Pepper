2008-05-18T02:19:00.000Z	amirman84	rouini	it just has a lot of islamic software preinstalled
2008-05-18T02:20:00.000Z	amirman84	rouini	if you go to add/remove in your menu and just search for "islam" you will get a lot of great software
2008-05-18T02:22:00.000Z	amirman84	rouini	you may have to go to administration> software sources and enable 3rd party, backports, and proposed first if you don't get a lot of software to show up
2008-05-18T02:23:00.000Z	amirman84	rouini	nevermind, there isn't very much apparently, you should go to synaptic package manager and search for islam there, you will get some more things to install
2008-05-18T02:24:00.000Z	amirman84	rouini	i would use the ubuntu muslim edition if i were you, it is the same as ubuntu 8.04 but it comes with a lot of islamic software preinstalled
2008-05-18T02:25:00.000Z	amirman84	rouini	i don't personally use any islamic software so i can't tell you any good ones, i'm an atheist :)
2008-05-18T02:27:00.000Z	amirman84	rouini	your welcome, i hope ubuntuME works for you, you can always download the ubuntuME ISO file and try to get the software from off of there, or you could just look at the UbuntuME website and they may have some links to some good software
2008-05-18T02:27:00.000Z	amirman84	rouini	i haven't used skype in ubuntu yet, i'm a newbie
2008-05-18T02:28:00.000Z	amirman84	rouini	did you see the islamic themed desktop themes and wallpapers in synaptic package manager? they look very nice
2008-05-18T02:30:00.000Z	amirman84	rouini	go to "system> administration> synaptic package manager" and search for "islam"
2008-05-18T03:03:00.000Z	amirman84	rouini	8.04 the hardiest heron
2008-05-18T03:05:00.000Z	amirman84	rouini	i haven't burned anything yet, but the default program that comes preinstalled looks pretty good
2008-05-18T03:07:00.000Z	amirman84	rouini	brasero disc burning
2008-05-18T03:18:00.000Z	amirman84	rouini	did you open synaptic package manager and search for "islam" ?
2008-05-18T03:19:00.000Z	amirman84	rouini	if you open synaptic package manager and search for "islam" there are a few islamic themes in there
2008-05-18T03:21:00.000Z	amirman84	rouini	ubuntume-themes  ,  ubuntume-gdm-themes  , and uspash-theme-ubuntume
2008-05-18T03:21:00.000Z	amirman84	rouini	do you know how to open synaptic package manager?
2008-05-18T03:23:00.000Z	amirman84	rouini	in synaptic package manager, at the top there is a button that says "search" click it and type "islam" in the search, all those themes i just listed will show up, click the check boxes beside them and then click the button that says "apply" at the top, they will install automatically
2008-05-18T03:24:00.000Z	amirman84	rouini	then you should be able to right click your desktop, select "change background" then click on the tab that says "themes" and change your theme right there, no need to search the internet at all
