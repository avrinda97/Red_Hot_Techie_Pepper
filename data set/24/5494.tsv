2006-06-27T08:17:00.000Z	Lynoure	zoor_	What do you mean by .login script? :)
2006-06-27T08:18:00.000Z	zoor_	Lynoure	Look at the URL I wrote. The last comment :)
2006-06-27T08:18:00.000Z	Lynoure	zoor_	your own . files are usually at ~/  (under your home directory)
2006-06-27T08:20:00.000Z	Lynoure	zoor_	A summary would have worked. That'd be .bashrc but better place for that is under ./kde/Autostart
2006-06-27T08:20:00.000Z	zoor_	Lynoure	yeah I know. However I thought I was suppose to have my own login script that would runt automaticly at boot up? But I couldn't find one looking like a login script
2006-06-27T08:20:00.000Z	Lynoure	zoor_	xmodmap does you nada outside x!
2006-06-27T08:20:00.000Z	zoor_	Lynoure	thanks :)
2006-06-27T08:21:00.000Z	zoor_	Lynoure	I'm only under x while inside the computer so I guess I'm in the clear?
2006-06-27T08:22:00.000Z	Lynoure	zoor_	hmm, lost me there. Or are you trying to add some other command than xmodmap?
2006-06-27T08:22:00.000Z	Lynoure	zoor_	And oops, sorry, I got confused between kubuntu and ubuntu again. I should prolly leave this channel... happens too often to me
2006-06-27T08:22:00.000Z	zoor_	Lynoure	I'm suppose to write a line like this " xmodmap ~/.xmodmap-`uname -n " in my .login file :)
2006-06-27T08:23:00.000Z	Lynoure	zoor_	what danfg said is better advice than mine
2006-06-27T08:23:00.000Z	zoor_	Lynoure	No worries... its better to help even if we're not always right. Thank you anyway. :)
2006-06-27T08:24:00.000Z	Lynoure	zoor_	I'm having a major brainlag day in general today...
2006-06-27T08:25:00.000Z	zoor_	Lynoure	then we're two then :D
