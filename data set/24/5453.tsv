2006-07-09T16:59:00.000Z	darkowl		guys I need help again...
2006-07-09T16:59:00.000Z	cps	darkowl	just ask your question
2006-07-09T05:00:00.000Z	darkowl		My CD-ROM is mounted as dev/hda and i need it as mnt/cdrom
2006-07-09T05:02:00.000Z	cps	darkowl	/dev/hda is the device not the mount point
2006-07-09T05:03:00.000Z	darkowl	cps	how can I see where my CDROM is mounted ?
2006-07-09T05:03:00.000Z	cps	darkowl	is it mounted at the moment?
2006-07-09T05:03:00.000Z	darkowl		cps:yes but I dont know where
2006-07-09T05:04:00.000Z	cps	darkowl	do you see a CD icon on the desktop?
2006-07-09T05:04:00.000Z	darkowl		cps:yes ; Dr4g: /dev/hda on /media/cdrom0
2006-07-09T05:04:00.000Z	cps	darkowl	then it looks like it is mounted under /media/cdrom0
2006-07-09T05:05:00.000Z	darkowl	cps	but can i make it so it mounts itself in mnt/cdrom ?
2006-07-09T05:06:00.000Z	cps	darkowl	yes, you just have to change the entry in the /etc/fstab file, and create a cdrom directroy under /mnt
2006-07-09T05:06:00.000Z	cps	darkowl	do you know how do edit fstab?
2006-07-09T05:06:00.000Z	darkowl	cps	yes
2006-07-09T05:06:00.000Z	darkowl		cps:ill try now
2006-07-09T05:09:00.000Z	darkowl	cps	now it wont unmount from media/cdrom0
2006-07-09T05:09:00.000Z	cps	darkowl	what does it say?
2006-07-09T05:10:00.000Z	darkowl		umount: /dev/hda mount disagrees with the fstab eject: unmount of `/media/cdrom0' failed
2006-07-09T05:10:00.000Z	cps	darkowl	try umount /media/cdrom0
2006-07-09T05:10:00.000Z	darkowl		cps:worked
2006-07-09T05:10:00.000Z	cps	darkowl	you have to give it the mount point because you changed the fstab
2006-07-09T05:11:00.000Z	cps	darkowl	and can you now mount it?
2006-07-09T05:11:00.000Z	darkowl	cps	Everything is wokring, thank you very much...
2006-07-09T05:11:00.000Z	cps	darkowl	no problems
