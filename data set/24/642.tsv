2011-04-18T13:36:00.000Z	kwtmm		dont know if 10.04 or 10.10 1or 11.,04
2011-04-18T13:36:00.000Z	ashmew2	kwtmm	what exactly do u need ?
2011-04-18T13:37:00.000Z	ashmew2	kwtmm	I know that lol. I meant , is there some specific set of applications that you are looking for ?
2011-04-18T13:38:00.000Z	ashmew2	kwtmm	So , whats the problem in using 10.10
2011-04-18T13:39:00.000Z	ashmew2	kwtmm	i am pretty sure that's not how you make sure if the system is identified.
2011-04-18T13:40:00.000Z	ashmew2	kwtmm	Give 10.10 a try (Live session)...Do you have any pen drives/thumb drives with you ?
2011-04-18T13:41:00.000Z	ashmew2	kwtmm	Download the ISO from download.ubuntu.com , make a live USB / live CD..Give it a spi
2011-04-18T13:43:00.000Z	ashmew2	kwtmm	Ubuntu is bundled with a default set of software..You can always install what you want..like KDE on a gnome desktop
2011-04-18T13:49:00.000Z	ashmew2	kwtmm	Yeah , LTS would be a good choice..but before you surely want to give it a spin from the live session.
2011-04-18T13:51:00.000Z	ashmew2	kwtmm	There are different tools for different jobs..You wouldnt want to use a screwdriver to hammer a nail instead of using a hammer. OS choice depends on the use.
2011-04-18T13:51:00.000Z	kwtmm	ashmew2	one question what do you use
2011-04-18T13:52:00.000Z	ashmew2	kwtmm	Fedora , Ubuntu , Sabayon , Mint , Win 7.
2011-04-18T13:52:00.000Z	ashmew2	kwtmm	but you should be able to choose one that fits your needs best..
2011-04-18T13:53:00.000Z	ashmew2	kwtmm	but for that we'll need to know what you're guna use it for..Precisely..and what do u mean by a production machine...put it in a shop ?
2011-04-18T13:54:00.000Z	kwtmm	ashmew2	no private ! ;)
2011-04-18T13:54:00.000Z	ashmew2	kwtmm	i didnt private you LOL
2011-04-18T13:55:00.000Z	ashmew2	kwtmm	haha , OK :P
2011-04-18T13:56:00.000Z	ashmew2	kwtmm	I have Win7 installed...from about 20 months or so..havent really needed to reinstall yet. You might wanna consider that..Same goes for Ubuntu as well though.
2011-04-18T13:57:00.000Z	ashmew2	kwtmm	Debian sounds like a good choice...Just pre plan a bit about some exotic hardware.
