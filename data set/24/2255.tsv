2009-02-24T12:49:00.000Z	Shaun		could anyone here help fix a problem i have with my system not starting up with my second sata drive attached.  if i connect it after booting up i can mount and use it fine...fsck throws up no errors
2009-02-24T12:51:00.000Z	roadrock	Shaun	have you insured the system bios sees the second drive?
2009-02-24T12:51:00.000Z	roadrock	Shaun	hrm
2009-02-24T12:53:00.000Z	roadrock	Shaun	check your /etc/fstab  wubi install?
2009-02-24T12:55:00.000Z	roadrock	Shaun	read your dmesg in a terminal, see why its confused
2009-02-24T12:56:00.000Z	roadrock	Shaun	terminal is in your apps menu somwhere
2009-02-24T13:02:00.000Z	Shaun	roadrock	just plugged in the drive now, and get this in dmesg http://www.pastebin.ca/1345644
2009-02-24T13:19:00.000Z	Shaun	roadrock	i have splash and quiet disabled so i can see the kernel output during startup...running dmesg after booting up sucessfully with the second hdd attached only allows me to view output from the current boot
2009-02-24T13:26:00.000Z	roadrock	Shaun	attach it then sudo fdisk -l  note the drive and edit /etc/fstab
2009-02-24T13:26:00.000Z	roadrock	Shaun	you have something weird happening
2009-02-24T13:27:00.000Z	roadrock	Shaun	fstab should mount it on boot if its instructed properly
2009-02-24T13:30:00.000Z	roadrock	Shaun	i think your fstab needs fixing
2009-02-24T13:30:00.000Z	roadrock	Shaun	k
2009-02-24T13:36:00.000Z	roadrock	Shaun	you might try /dev/sdf  /mnt/store  butusing LVM..I dunno. backup the file first
2009-02-24T14:05:00.000Z	Shaun	roadrock	the system hangs at the same point even with the reference to mounting the partition is commented out
2009-02-24T14:05:00.000Z	Shaun	roadrock	if i leave it long enough there is a kernel panic
2009-02-24T14:06:00.000Z	roadrock	Shaun	I don't know LVM
2009-02-24T14:11:00.000Z	Shaun	roadrock	i'll look into the possibility of it being an lvm issue
2009-02-25T03:38:00.000Z	Shaun	roadrock	hello agai
2009-02-25T03:39:00.000Z	Shaun	roadrock	there was a bug in the new udev (i use jaunty, prob should have mentioned that) causing it to repeatedly update lvm as if it had changed
2009-02-25T03:40:00.000Z	roadrock	Shaun	good detective work
2009-02-25T03:44:00.000Z	roadrock	Shaun	wow, good job.
2009-02-25T03:44:00.000Z	Shaun	roadrock	i didnt really have to do anything, the bug was fixed sometime today and an update cured it :)
2009-02-25T03:45:00.000Z	roadrock	Shaun	linux rules, way to go
