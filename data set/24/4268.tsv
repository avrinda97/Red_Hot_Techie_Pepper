2008-02-17T19:17:00.000Z	faileas	IndyGunFreak	about KDE
2008-02-17T19:18:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	faileas	lol, oh ok... sorry, my opinion always invades me on KDE questions..lol
2008-02-17T19:19:00.000Z	faileas	IndyGunFreak	understood. as someone who's mainly a windows user, the whole DM war amuses me ;p
2008-02-17T19:19:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	faileas	lol
2008-02-20T19:02:00.000Z	faileas	IndyGunFreak	its sad, but i tend to pick distros by support channels
2008-02-20T19:03:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	faileas	not really sad, you're just predicting problems, want to make sure you can get help... better than diving head first into a pool w/o water
2008-02-20T19:28:00.000Z	faileas	IndyGunFreak	personally i prefer kopete, but pidgin is great ;p
2008-02-20T19:29:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	faileas	kopete has the same problem for me, that kDE does.. its freakin ugly, and looksl ike its GUI was set by a 4yr old.
2008-02-20T19:30:00.000Z	faileas	IndyGunFreak	i love KDE ;p
2008-02-20T19:30:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	faileas	i'd rather give Rosie O'Donnell a pair of golf cleats, and let her stomp on my face, than use KDE..
2008-02-20T19:31:00.000Z	faileas	IndyGunFreak	i've used gnome, CDE, KDE and a few windows shells. wierdly CDE is my fav, but KDE is the one i use most ;p
2008-02-20T19:31:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	faileas	i guess thats the beauty of Linux, you're not stuck with what they say is best.
2008-02-20T19:32:00.000Z	faileas	IndyGunFreak	yup, and they let you know it
2008-05-11T16:13:00.000Z	faileas	IndyGunFreak	i use gnome too (on another system). cripes its a desktop envitonment, not a religion ;p
2008-05-11T16:13:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	faileas	lol, for me, its almost religion, i despise kDE..
2008-05-11T16:14:00.000Z	faileas	IndyGunFreak	i'm platform agnostic ;p
2008-05-11T16:15:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	faileas	lol
2008-05-11T16:15:00.000Z	faileas	IndyGunFreak	in more ways than one ;p
