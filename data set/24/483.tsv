2011-08-14T09:25:00.000Z	dd_		would anyone be willing to help me figure out how to get my line printer working with lucid server?
2011-08-14T09:25:00.000Z	dd_		i can't think of anything else
2011-08-14T09:26:00.000Z	dd_		my usb > parallel adapter shows up in lsusb
2011-08-14T09:27:00.000Z	dd_		lsmod shows everything i think should have loaded
2011-08-14T09:27:00.000Z	dd_		yet there's no device
2011-08-14T09:29:00.000Z	dd_		nobody likes line printers? :(
2011-08-14T09:30:00.000Z	allandee	dd_	I love line printers
2011-08-14T09:31:00.000Z	allandee	dd_	what is the lucid server, how does it not work, and what are you trying to do that provokes the failure?
2011-08-14T09:34:00.000Z	allandee	dd_	we're talking about the dinosour type oki 380 that takes  paper with holes on both sides of fed paper here?
2011-08-14T09:42:00.000Z	allandee	dd_	you should, and in which case, you should be able to do    echo "lol" > /dev/lp0
2011-08-14T09:42:00.000Z	allandee	dd_	cups will ruin your life in this case.
2011-08-14T09:45:00.000Z	allandee	dd_	 be afraid.  however;  if your BIOS is standard-y, the /dev/lp* should have have an entry that gives you direct access to it
2011-08-14T09:45:00.000Z	allandee	dd_	what does ls /dev/lp* say?
2011-08-14T09:48:00.000Z	allandee	dd_	that is unfortunate.  there is not even an entry, with an unresolved link, to /dev/lp0?
2011-08-14T09:50:00.000Z	dd_	allandee	i have a usb to parallel converter for it, so i was thinking that it was causeing the problem
2011-08-14T09:50:00.000Z	allandee	dd_	I don't think Ubuntu is the distribution you would like to choose as your starting point then. I imagine any/all other distros heed that ancient protocol.
2011-08-14T09:51:00.000Z	allandee	dd_	oh, certainly, that changes things :p
2011-08-14T09:54:00.000Z	allandee	dd_	which is the pertinent line from lsmod?
2011-08-14T09:55:00.000Z	dd_	allandee	if i lsmod | grep ls i get . . .
2011-08-14T10:01:00.000Z	dd_	allandee	nothing unusual
2011-08-14T10:02:00.000Z	allandee	dd_	what's the usual, in the context of unplugging and replugging your printer?
2011-08-14T10:08:00.000Z	allandee	dd_	huh.  is this a laptop?
2011-08-14T10:08:00.000Z	dd_	allandee	nope, i moved and lost the old cable
2011-08-14T10:14:00.000Z	allandee	dd_	 depending on your time/money schedule, maybe you want to look into a motherboard that has a centronics style parallel port output.  they're starting at around 15 dollars.
