2008-05-07T03:54:00.000Z	Aruza		'
2008-05-07T03:55:00.000Z	bazhang	Aruza	in the boot params try all_generic_ide
2008-05-07T03:56:00.000Z	bazhang	Aruza	or in the busybox shell try to modprobe generic ide
2008-05-07T03:57:00.000Z	Aruza	bazhang	it says FATAL: Module generic not found
2008-05-07T03:57:00.000Z	bazhang	Aruza	you know the grub menu? the one you can enter at the *very* beginning (after bios)?
2008-05-07T03:57:00.000Z	bazhang	Aruza	ah try generic_ide or generic-ide
2008-05-07T03:59:00.000Z	Aruza	bazhang	same result for generic_ide and generic-ide
2008-05-07T03:59:00.000Z	bazhang	Aruza	I must be mis-rememberating, hang on a sec
2008-05-07T04:01:00.000Z	bazhang	Aruza	what about modprobe ide-disk what does that return
2008-05-07T04:02:00.000Z	Aruza	bazhang	nothin except a new prompt
2008-05-07T04:02:00.000Z	bazhang	Aruza	okay good
2008-05-07T04:06:00.000Z	Aruza	bazhang	now i have a few lines saying I/O resource not free and ports already in use
2008-05-07T04:06:00.000Z	bazhang	Aruza	I saw that still looking for a solution hang on
2008-05-07T04:07:00.000Z	Aruza	bazhang	kk =)
2008-05-07T04:12:00.000Z	bazhang	Aruza	what is the exact error message you get (or something close) that drops you into busybox shell
2008-05-07T04:14:00.000Z	Aruza	bazhang	i dont see an error it goes right from the Ubuntu loading screen into the shell
2008-05-07T04:15:00.000Z	Aruza	bazhang	i found it, had to load recovery, ALERT! /host/ubuntu/disks/root.disk does not exist
2008-05-07T04:15:00.000Z	bazhang	Aruza	okay you need to reboot wubi, and then enter the grub menu and add that (e to edit the kernel it will boot) all_generic_ide to the end of the boot parameters (near quiet, splash, etc) then d then b to boot
2008-05-07T04:21:00.000Z	Aruza	bazhang	followed your directions and it still didnt boot. now when i get into the shell and press ctrl-d i dont get any error message
2008-05-07T04:23:00.000Z	bazhang	Aruza	what other partitions do you have and what format are they in or just the vista one
2008-05-07T04:23:00.000Z	Aruza	bazhang	i do have vista installed also and thats ntfs
2008-05-07T04:23:00.000Z	bazhang	Aruza	hmm that is odd
2008-05-07T04:29:00.000Z	bazhang	Aruza	okay, got a bit further-->can you check /proc/partitions
