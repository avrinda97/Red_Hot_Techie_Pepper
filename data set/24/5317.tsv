2006-08-17T06:27:00.000Z	chendo		what's the easiest way to setup a NAT server on ubuntu server?
2006-08-17T06:27:00.000Z	chendo		like, router-style
2006-08-17T06:27:00.000Z	chendo		with DHCP and all
2006-08-17T06:27:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	chendo	install dhcp-server, install shorewall and set it up.
2006-08-17T06:28:00.000Z	chendo	fyrestrtr	i'm kinda stuck on the whole 'zones' part of the shorewall thing
2006-08-17T06:28:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	chendo	stuck how?
2006-08-17T06:29:00.000Z	chendo	fyrestrtr	i've got no clue what a zonefile is
2006-08-17T06:31:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	chendo	how many network cards in your router machine?
2006-08-17T06:31:00.000Z	chendo	fyrestrtr	one
2006-08-17T06:31:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	chendo	what do you want the machine to do exactly?
2006-08-17T06:32:00.000Z	chendo	fyrestrtr	act as a router, so DHCP, NAT, firewlal
2006-08-17T06:32:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	chendo	to route, you need two networks. How are you connecting to the other network?
2006-08-17T06:32:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	chendo	it there a modem installed?
2006-08-17T06:33:00.000Z	chendo	fyrestrtr	modem->uplink port in hub, server in hub, rest of computers in hub
2006-08-17T06:33:00.000Z	chendo	fyrestrtr	i've done this before, so i know it can be done
2006-08-17T06:35:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	chendo	well, the shorewall page has a nice writeup on this, but its a lot easer if you have two network cards :)
2006-08-17T06:37:00.000Z	chendo	fyrestrtr	yeah, but i can't get to it properly cause all i've got is irssi at the moment
