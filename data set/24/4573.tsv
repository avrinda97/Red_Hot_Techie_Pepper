2008-05-17T20:49:00.000Z	amenado		Pollywog-> and what device do you have to make the actual dialing to your POTS ?
2008-05-17T20:49:00.000Z	Pollywog	amenado	via modem
2008-05-17T20:50:00.000Z	Pollywog	amenado	like what Windows does with dialer.exe
2008-05-17T20:50:00.000Z	amenado		Pollywog-> yes you can use wvdial to issue Hayes AT commands and dial out..now to pickup the reciever to answer and connect it to your voice source ..not sure
2008-05-17T20:51:00.000Z	amenado		Pollywog-> i dont remember what dialer.exe does..how do you then want to answer the phone line?
2008-05-17T20:51:00.000Z	Pollywog	amenado	thanks, I had not thought of that, I thought wvdial was only for starting PPP sessions... thanks
2008-05-17T20:51:00.000Z	Pollywog	amenado	I just need it for dialing out
2008-05-17T20:52:00.000Z	amenado	weix	i cant recall the name of the gui either
2008-05-17T20:52:00.000Z	amenado		Pollywog-> well wvdial can do the dialing
2008-05-17T20:52:00.000Z	Pollywog	amenado	probably, I had not thought of it
2008-05-17T20:52:00.000Z	amenado		Pollywog-> then you have to write scripts and such after..
2008-05-17T20:53:00.000Z	Pollywog	amenado	oh I see I am not explaining it well
2008-05-17T20:53:00.000Z	amenado		weix-> oh yeah, it can be done indeed, if not with gui, cli off course is readily available
2008-05-17T20:53:00.000Z	Pollywog	amenado	I want to make REGULAR calls from my computer and talk using a heaset/mic
2008-05-17T20:53:00.000Z	Pollywog		headset
2008-05-17T20:54:00.000Z	Pollywog		rather than the regular telephone handset
2008-05-17T20:54:00.000Z	amenado		Pollywog-> well after you make it dial, your scripts has to put the connection to sleep while you're having the voice convo,
2008-05-17T20:54:00.000Z	Pollywog	amenado	thanks
2008-05-17T20:54:00.000Z	amenado		Pollywog-> you're modem has interface for your mic i hope
2008-05-17T20:55:00.000Z	Pollywog	amenado	it would not need one... I guess I will have to use XP if I want to do this
2008-05-17T20:55:00.000Z	Pollywog		or else just buy a different telephone with plugs for handset/mic
2008-05-17T20:56:00.000Z	amenado		Pollywog-> no one is stopping you, to do those, you are trying to use an equipment designed for something else, but hey thats what innovators do..all power to them
2008-05-17T20:57:00.000Z	amenado		Pollywog-> even using windows, if your modem does not have a mic input..dont know how you'd expect to have a convo
2008-05-17T20:57:00.000Z	Pollywog	amenado	what I need is a "softphone" type thing like what Skype has, but for ordinary calls instead of VoIP
