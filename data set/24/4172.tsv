2007-06-18T15:07:00.000Z	drogomir		i keep getting really strange error... after startx (or trying to log via kdm) i get something like "Xlib: connection to ":0.0" refused by server Xlib: No protocol specified " - and the strange thing is I can run X from root....
2007-06-18T15:08:00.000Z	drogomir		mybe someone here could help me ;] 
2007-06-18T15:09:00.000Z	drogomir		yeah... who knows - I googled for a while and solution to this error is always xhost + but I could do that *after* starting X :] 
2007-06-18T15:09:00.000Z	th1	drogomir	what was your problem again?
2007-06-18T15:11:00.000Z	th1	drogomir	is the X server up and running? ie. do you see the X screen?
2007-06-18T15:12:00.000Z	drogomir	th1	but after startx
2007-06-18T15:12:00.000Z	th1	drogomir	what is output of "ps axw|grep /usr/bin/X"
2007-06-18T15:12:00.000Z	drogomir	th1	there is that awful screen with X as a cursor
2007-06-18T15:12:00.000Z	th1	drogomir	my guess it has a different display than :0 due to some issues with your xorg.conf
2007-06-18T15:14:00.000Z	drogomir	th1	i will look at that ps - but I dont't know if this is the thing - root don't get that error
2007-06-18T15:15:00.000Z	drogomir	th1	output: 9460  tty1 S+ 0:00 grep /usr/bin/X ;] 
2007-06-18T15:16:00.000Z	th1	drogomir	if the X server is running that is really weird
2007-06-18T15:20:00.000Z	drogomir	th1	wait... :) my mistake - I let my brother do it - he thought X are running I'll upload output to server :P

2007-06-18T15:23:00.000Z	drogomir	th1	(I changed to grep X :]  )
2007-06-18T15:26:00.000Z	th1	drogomir	what ubuntu version are you using?
2007-06-18T15:31:00.000Z	th1	drogomir	my X command line is much different from yours. Mine is started by kdm.. is yours the same if you start it by kdm/gdm?
2007-06-18T15:33:00.000Z	th1	drogomir	mine is "/usr/bin/X -br -nolisten tcp :0 vt7 -auth /var/run/xauth/A:0-bu6f5P"
2007-06-18T15:36:00.000Z	drogomir	th1	i will make some tests :)
2007-06-18T15:42:00.000Z	drogomir	th1	whaaaaa...... thanks for help.... problem was really stupid - it was my brother's computer and after some time i realised that there is no space left on / ....
2007-06-18T15:43:00.000Z	th1	drogomir	hehe :)
2007-06-18T15:43:00.000Z	drogomir	th1	solution was to remove some files o.O
2007-06-18T15:43:00.000Z	th1	drogomir	glad it works for you now :)
2007-06-18T15:43:00.000Z	th1	drogomir	welcome :)
