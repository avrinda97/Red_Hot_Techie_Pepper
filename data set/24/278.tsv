2012-01-03T05:48:00.000Z	Kiten	Bunie	on my p3 i use ubuntu but i installed fluxbox as a window manager
2012-01-03T05:49:00.000Z	Bunie	Kiten	he will still have difficulties installing :P
2012-01-03T05:49:00.000Z	Bunie	Kiten	I assume P3 computers have 64 to 256MB of ram
2012-01-03T05:50:00.000Z	Kiten	Bunie	yeah most have 256mb though its pretty tough to find one with a 64 stick unless they never upgraded
2012-01-03T05:50:00.000Z	Bunie	Kiten	Even still, i think the Ubuntu installer will freeze with 256
2012-01-03T05:50:00.000Z	Kiten	Bunie	i've used it succefully its slower than crap
2012-01-03T06:00:00.000Z	Kiten	Bunie	common now i've got it running on my p3
2012-01-03T06:00:00.000Z	Bunie	Kiten	he has no idea how much ram he has
2012-01-03T06:00:00.000Z	Bunie	Kiten	So odds are its never seen an upgrade
2012-01-03T06:00:00.000Z	Bunie	Kiten	a pc with Pent3 with no upgrades?
2012-01-03T06:01:00.000Z	Kiten	Bunie	its nearly un heard of
2012-01-03T06:01:00.000Z	Bunie	Kiten	ubuntu installer requires over 300MB of ram
2012-01-03T06:01:00.000Z	Kiten	Bunie	it will run with 256 i've done it
2012-01-03T06:01:00.000Z	Bunie	Kiten	i still think he has 64 or 128
2012-01-03T08:44:00.000Z	Kiten	Bunie	he is wanting graphics acceleration
2012-01-03T08:46:00.000Z	Bunie	Kiten	I have graphics acceleration >3< I can play 3D Games anyway
2012-01-03T08:46:00.000Z	Kiten	Bunie	he appears to have an older card
2012-01-03T08:50:00.000Z	Bunie	Kiten	knows more then i do
2012-01-03T08:56:00.000Z	Bunie	Kiten	go with what i found on the walmart.com page GMa 4500M
2012-01-03T09:01:00.000Z	Bunie	Kiten	gnome is pretty cpu efficient :P
