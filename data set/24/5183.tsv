2006-09-30T06:52:00.000Z	Rejo	AAAle	what happens if you telnet to that box?
2006-09-30T06:52:00.000Z	Rejo	AAAle	port 25 (of course)
2006-09-30T06:53:00.000Z	AAAle		http://rafb.net/paste/results/bfN9IQ52.html
2006-09-30T06:53:00.000Z	AAAle	Rejo	i try
2006-09-30T06:53:00.000Z	AAAle	Rejo	http://rafb.net/paste/results/o9KWvg91.html
2006-09-30T06:53:00.000Z	AAAle		it seems to work
2006-09-30T06:53:00.000Z	Rejo	AAAle	ok, now go ahead typing a smtp session
2006-09-30T06:53:00.000Z	AAAle		i think that it is a ubuntu problem because same configuration in gentoo works
2006-09-30T06:58:00.000Z	AAAle	Rejo	http://rafb.net/paste/results/CfqnK556.html <-- with telnet works
2006-09-30T06:59:00.000Z	Rejo	AAAle	i am missing the responses of the server, but i still believe this works. what happens if you telnet from another point?
2006-09-30T07:00:00.000Z	Rejo	AAAle	and, you don't get the same disconnects on the other box ?
2006-09-30T07:00:00.000Z	Rejo	AAAle	i believe those are quite normal
2006-09-30T07:00:00.000Z	AAAle	Rejo	have i got to telnet from a machine external to my network?
2006-09-30T07:00:00.000Z	Rejo	AAAle	think of callback and sender verification stuff and such
