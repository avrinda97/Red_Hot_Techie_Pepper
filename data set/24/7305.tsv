2005-02-21T17:04:00.000Z	shingokii		Anyone know why ubunt doesn't have firefox 1.0?
2005-02-21T17:05:00.000Z	Xappe	shingokii	because warty was released before ff1
2005-02-21T17:05:00.000Z	shingokii	Xappe	do the versions in the repository not get updated though?
2005-02-21T17:06:00.000Z	Xappe	shingokii	no the versions are locked after release
2005-02-21T17:06:00.000Z	shingokii	Xappe	oh that sucks :(
2005-02-21T17:08:00.000Z	Xappe	shingokii	i've done it myself in december ;)
2005-02-21T17:08:00.000Z	shingokii	Xappe	if I upgrade to hoary now (is that possible?) then will it just keep updating until final release?
2005-02-21T17:09:00.000Z	Xappe	shingokii	yes
2005-02-21T17:09:00.000Z	shingokii	Xappe	that excites me strangely. So what do I do, dist-upgrade?
2005-02-21T17:10:00.000Z	Xappe	shingokii	change all warty to hoary in your sources.list. then apt-get update, apt-get dist-upgrade
2005-02-21T17:11:00.000Z	shingokii	Xappe	is there a wiki page about that?
2005-02-21T17:11:00.000Z	Xappe	shingokii	yes I think so
2005-02-21T17:11:00.000Z	shingokii	Xappe	I might as well try it now when I've just installed, so there is less to break
2005-02-21T17:20:00.000Z	shingokii	Xappe	ok fixed the sources.list, what do I run to update/upgrade?
2005-02-21T17:21:00.000Z	Xappe	shingokii	apt-get update
2005-02-21T17:21:00.000Z	Xappe	shingokii	apt-get dist-upgrade
2005-02-21T17:21:00.000Z	shingokii	Xappe	thanks :)
2005-02-21T17:22:00.000Z	Xappe	shingokii	and as sudo of course
2005-02-21T17:22:00.000Z	shingokii	Xappe	is there much day-to-day broken stuff?
2005-02-21T17:25:00.000Z	Xappe	shingokii	no not much, but some thing do break but it get fixed quite fast most of the time
2005-02-21T17:26:00.000Z	shingokii	Xappe	sounds good :) I might as well try it since I've had to reinstall anyway
2005-02-21T17:27:00.000Z	Xappe	shingokii	yes, since you have aclean system and it just takes about 25 mins to reinstall warty
2005-02-21T17:27:00.000Z	shingokii	Xappe	yup, so when I break it I can go back to nice safe old version and wait for real hoary release :) Thanks for help btw
2005-02-21T17:28:00.000Z	Xappe	shingokii	np :) good luck!
