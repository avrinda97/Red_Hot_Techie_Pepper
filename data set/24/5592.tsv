2006-06-16T11:37:00.000Z	Bassetts		wonder what this will mean for MS
2006-06-16T11:37:00.000Z	mneptok	Bassetts	he needs to be reformatted because of spyware.
2006-06-17T13:02:00.000Z	mneptok	Bassetts	you want "screen"
2006-06-17T13:02:00.000Z	Bassetts	mneptok	how does that work?
2006-06-17T13:03:00.000Z	mneptok	Bassetts	screen creates a virtual TTY that is not connected to a specific login session, allowing apps run in screen to run even when you log out
2006-06-17T13:03:00.000Z	Bassetts	mneptok	so what would i enter into the sh?
2006-06-17T13:03:00.000Z	mneptok	Bassetts	there's no shell script necessary
2006-06-17T13:04:00.000Z	Bassetts	mneptok	so id type, screen irssi??
2006-06-17T13:04:00.000Z	mneptok	Bassetts	correct
2006-06-17T13:04:00.000Z	Bassetts	mneptok	do what i need in irssi then close terminal?
2006-06-17T13:04:00.000Z	mneptok	Bassetts	and irssi can be configured to auto-connect to servers and auto-join channels
2006-06-17T13:04:00.000Z	Bassetts	mneptok	then it will run until the machine is shutdown?
2006-06-17T13:04:00.000Z	mneptok	Bassetts	or until you /quit irssi
2006-06-17T13:05:00.000Z	Bassetts	mneptok	ok, im doing this to run irssi to log a channel over ssh, what would i do if i wanted to open irssi again in my ssh session?
2006-06-17T13:05:00.000Z	mneptok	Bassetts	reconnect to the machine, then "screen -r"
2006-06-17T13:06:00.000Z	Bassetts	mneptok	seems screen isnt installed on the server =(
2006-06-17T13:06:00.000Z	mneptok	Bassetts	so install it :)
2006-06-17T13:06:00.000Z	Bassetts	mneptok	im not allowed apt-get use on the server, it isnt mine
2006-06-17T13:07:00.000Z	mneptok	Bassetts	you can still install it in your ~/, and add the location to your $PATH
2006-06-17T13:07:00.000Z	Bassetts	mneptok	=S ok, how do i do that, bit noob here
2006-06-17T13:07:00.000Z	mneptok	Bassetts	or ask the admin to install it
2006-06-17T13:08:00.000Z	Bassetts	mneptok	for me to install would i have to get screen from the internet on this pc, then upload to the server and install?
2006-06-17T13:08:00.000Z	mneptok	Bassetts	/query window, please
