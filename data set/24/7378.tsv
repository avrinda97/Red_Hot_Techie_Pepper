2011-09-26T05:39:00.000Z	dr_willis	maheanuu	 and there are windows rescue/recovery/repair dvds you can get to fix any bad filesystems.
2011-09-26T05:39:00.000Z	dr_willis	maheanuu	 you CAN get a DVD that has windows on it... for free, legally, from ms..
2011-09-26T05:40:00.000Z	maheanuu	dr_willis	wow do you have more info or a lind?
2011-09-26T05:40:00.000Z	dr_willis	maheanuu	 i think i bookmarked the link at my delicious.com/dr_willis site. I learned about the disks from the Lifehacker blog site.
2011-09-26T05:41:00.000Z	maheanuu	dr_willis	I use them for storage
2011-09-26T05:43:00.000Z	dr_willis	maheanuu	 http://www.delicious.com/dr_willis/windows    has links to the recovery disks - if you need to 'file system check' the drives.

2011-09-26T05:46:00.000Z	dr_willis	maheanuu	 i never really looked at your pastebin of the error message and you never summariuzed it.. so i dont know what your original issue is.
2011-09-26T05:47:00.000Z	dr_willis	maheanuu	 the win vista/7 recovery disk links there - let you get a windows 'rescue' type dvd you can boot and do various fs checks and other fix's.
2011-09-26T05:49:00.000Z	maheanuu	dr_willis	What is happening is that it tells me that it cannot be mounted and there are trashed files  It is telling me to do a fdisk /f and then reboot 2 times and I saw that  but not knowing 7 at all I wasn't sure
2011-09-26T05:49:00.000Z	maheanuu	dr_willis	headed back there now
2011-09-26T05:49:00.000Z	dr_willis	maheanuu	 then you need to use a friends windows pc., or one of those dvd's to filesystem check the hd's
2011-09-26T05:55:00.000Z	maheanuu	dr_willis	Thanks for your help, and time....  I have your page bookmarked now...
2011-12-02T07:06:00.000Z	dr_willis	maheanuu	 ddrescue the drives to a image file, and try to recover from the image file. is what i did the other day for a failing 1 TB hd.
2011-12-02T07:11:00.000Z	dr_willis	maheanuu	 if you are lucky ddrescue will recover them.. and/or photorec..  it took me a week to recovery my 1tb.. but i got like 99% of the files from it.
2012-04-19T08:51:00.000Z	dr_willis	maheanuu	 try installing somthing simple from the repos like 'unp' or 'pastebinit' see if that works.. sudo apt-get install pastebinit
2012-04-19T09:45:00.000Z	maheanuu	dr_willis	I sent you the last paste errors when I tried to do an upgrade using the upgrade manager and it runs and runs and then just fails and plays dead?????
2012-04-19T09:46:00.000Z	dr_willis	maheanuu	 id stick to the cli tools . better error messages. and  it looks like server either had some currupted files . or the connection is flakey. try switching mirroes.
2012-04-19T09:47:00.000Z	maheanuu	dr_willis	what are the cli tools and are they listed
2012-04-19T09:47:00.000Z	dr_willis	maheanuu	 apt-get and so so forth.
