2010-05-17T17:03:00.000Z	compaq		I can't seem to zoom out my desktop, anyone know how.  Also, how do you know if you are running compiz or not?
2010-05-17T17:03:00.000Z	soreau	compaq	For the latter, ps ax|grep compiz|grep -v grep
2010-05-17T17:04:00.000Z	soreau	compaq	If there is any output from that command, it is running
2010-05-17T17:04:00.000Z	compaq	soreau	thanks
2010-05-17T17:05:00.000Z	soreau	compaq	Try Super+Scroll to zoom
2010-05-17T17:05:00.000Z	compaq	soreau	nothing happens, although compiz is running
2010-05-17T17:06:00.000Z	soreau	compaq	Cab you explain what you mean by zoom is stuck?
2010-05-17T17:06:00.000Z	compaq	soreau	well, I just don't know how to get it to zoom out, so all the windows are small and arranged up, and I can click to bring them back with the one I click on top
2010-05-17T17:08:00.000Z	compaq	soreau	super is the windows button between alt and ctrl right?
2010-05-17T17:09:00.000Z	soreau	compaq	Ah, do you have the scale plugin in ccsm?
2010-05-17T17:10:00.000Z	soreau	compaq	Yes, super is what you think it is
2010-05-17T17:12:00.000Z	soreau	compaq	Try selecting Extra in sys>prefs>appearance>visual effect, or install ccsm and make sure scale is enable
2010-05-17T17:12:00.000Z	soreau	compaq	I dont think you want super+scroll (it is a different kind of zoom)
2010-05-17T17:13:00.000Z	compaq	soreau	I don't have the extra option, I am using Xubuntu
2010-05-17T17:13:00.000Z	soreau	compaq	Well in xfce, just look in ccsm and make sure Scale is enabled then use it by moving your mouse to the upper right
2010-05-17T17:19:00.000Z	soreau	compaq	Well in xfce, just look in ccsm and make sure Scale is enabled then use it by moving your mouse to the upper right of your screen
2010-05-17T17:20:00.000Z	compaq	soreau	I did that but it doesn't work.  There is something wrong here cause even the wobbly windows isn't working.  I think I need to use the intel video driver rather than the generic
2010-05-17T17:22:00.000Z	soreau	compaq	hm. Can you show the output of ps ax|egrep "compiz|xfwm"|grep -v grep ?
2010-05-17T17:24:00.000Z	soreau	compaq	That shows you do not have compiz running. Try compiz --replace from your Alt+F2 run dialog
2010-05-17T17:25:00.000Z	compaq	soreau	hey, you are cool, how did you notice it isn't running from that out put, anyway, when I did replace, it went back to fallback, and this was issue: Blacklisted PCI ID 8086:2562 detected
2010-05-17T17:26:00.000Z	soreau	compaq	Oh yes that is because the intel driver isnt too great and neither is your gpu chipset
2010-05-17T17:26:00.000Z	compaq	soreau	hmm, ok, but it is 128 mb video card
2010-05-17T17:26:00.000Z	compaq	soreau	how to I try another driver for my video card?
2010-05-23T04:10:00.000Z	soreau	compaq	That's probably because debian is using an older version of the intel driver
