2007-10-03T07:17:00.000Z	guru		how do i install just one package from testing?
2007-10-03T07:18:00.000Z	h1st0	guru	download and install it although its not recomended what are you tyring to do?
2007-10-03T07:18:00.000Z	guru	h1st0	i'm attepting to get freevo to work with the broken pygame version packaged with feisty
2007-10-03T07:19:00.000Z	h1st0	guru	you could build your own packages from source would be a better option.  However, if you want to try it packages are at packages.ubuntu.com
2007-10-03T07:19:00.000Z	guru	h1st0	all i wanted to do is either install python2.4 without uninstalling all my other packages or install the latest pygame that was fixed
2007-10-03T07:19:00.000Z	h1st0	guru	I would just search the forums for freevo as i'm sure people have it working.
2007-10-03T07:19:00.000Z	guru	h1st0	fyi freevo on amd64 crashes with the following message "ValueError: Buffer length does not equal format and resolution size"
2007-10-03T07:20:00.000Z	h1st0	guru	well you could just build the pygame deb from source with checkinstall or install the deb.
2007-10-03T07:20:00.000Z	h1st0	guru	I don't know anything about freevo i've typically used myth
2007-10-03T07:20:00.000Z	guru	h1st0	i searched google and the most common answer is to revert python versions
2007-10-03T07:21:00.000Z	guru	h1st0	mythtv doesn't work well for me...ti's overly bloated and doesn't seem very stable. i just want something that will cat /dev/video0 and dump it to a video file at a predetermined time
2007-10-03T07:21:00.000Z	h1st0	guru	you could just do it on your own.
2007-10-03T07:22:00.000Z	h1st0	guru	or make a script to create a cron job and do it.  etc...
2007-10-03T07:23:00.000Z	guru	h1st0	it doesn't work that way - you can't simply cat /dev/video0 and dump it to a file
2007-10-03T07:23:00.000Z	h1st0	guru	sure you can if you have an mpeg2 encoder card
2007-10-03T07:23:00.000Z	h1st0	guru	I do it all the time.
2007-10-03T07:23:00.000Z	guru	h1st0	i don't
2007-10-03T07:24:00.000Z	guru	h1st0	is there an easy way to uninstall python2.5 and install python2.4 instead without uninstalling everything that depends on python?
2007-10-03T07:26:00.000Z	h1st0	guru	not really have you searched the forums?
2007-10-03T07:26:00.000Z	guru	h1st0	i've searched google
2007-10-03T07:28:00.000Z	h1st0	guru	search the forums at ubuntuforums.org
2007-10-03T07:28:00.000Z	h1st0	guru	for your specific problem.  I'm sure someone else has expereinced it if you claim there is a package broken.
2007-10-03T07:42:00.000Z	guru	h1st0	nothing on the forums pointing to any answers - just a lot of people with the same issue
2007-10-07T05:50:00.000Z	h1st0	guru	maybe there is an error with yoru ../interfaces file?  if not ifdown eth0 ifup eth0
