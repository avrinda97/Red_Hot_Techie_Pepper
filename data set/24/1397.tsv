2010-02-14T21:30:00.000Z	robertpolson		:/
2010-02-14T21:30:00.000Z	robertpolson		help?
2010-02-14T21:30:00.000Z	robertpolson		<-- should be more careful with the dd command.
2010-02-14T21:30:00.000Z	robertpolson		huh?
2010-02-14T21:30:00.000Z	robertpolson		Nah, this isn't a bug, it's my own doing.
2010-02-14T21:31:00.000Z	robertpolson		basically i have overwritten my MBR, i think, just how f**ked am I?
2010-02-14T21:32:00.000Z	carbm2	robertpolson	if grub started then you didn't overwrite you MBR. Sounds like you messed up your partition table and it can't find it now.
2010-02-14T21:32:00.000Z	robertpolson		hm
2010-02-14T21:32:00.000Z	robertpolson	carbm2	that makes sense
2010-02-14T21:32:00.000Z	robertpolson		is there a way to restore the partition table somehow?
2010-02-14T21:33:00.000Z	robertpolson		or should I just say to hell with it and load up my windows recovery disc?
2010-02-14T21:33:00.000Z	carbm2	robertpolson	Probably not.
2010-02-14T21:33:00.000Z	robertpolson		okay. thanks
2010-02-14T21:33:00.000Z	robertpolson		multiple :/
2010-02-14T21:33:00.000Z	carbm2	robertpolson	I would load the live cd and have a look with GPARTed.
2010-02-14T21:34:00.000Z	carbm2	robertpolson	to see whats going on with your patition tables.
2010-02-14T21:34:00.000Z	robertpolson		okay
2010-02-14T21:34:00.000Z	robertpolson		what's the fastest way to download the disc image for karmic?
2010-02-14T21:34:00.000Z	robertpolson		:/
2010-02-14T21:34:00.000Z	carbm2	robertpolson	If you load the live cd... you can run "sudo sfdisk -l" to list all the partitions where you could pastebin it.
2010-02-14T21:34:00.000Z	robertpolson		hm
2010-02-14T21:34:00.000Z	robertpolson		okay
