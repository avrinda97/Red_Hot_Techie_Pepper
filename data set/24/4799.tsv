2007-01-08T16:03:00.000Z	Sling		on my compaq presario v2000, i have setup all the drivers and blacklisted bcm43xx.  if i do a ndiswrapper -l it says bcmwl5 driver installed, hardware present....i restart, and when i do, the wireless light ont eh laptop just blinks, it doe snot stay constant which is what it does on windows.  i cannot access the internet or router either
2007-01-08T16:04:00.000Z	Tonren	Sling	That's bizarre.  I'm on a Presario v2565us (that's v2000 series as well) and ndiswrapper has been working for me.
2007-01-08T16:04:00.000Z	Sling	Tonren	do you have any ideas
2007-01-08T16:04:00.000Z	Sling	Tonren	 Like what did u do after u installed the drivers?
2007-01-08T16:05:00.000Z	Tonren	Sling	Try this: sudo rmmod bcm43xx; sudo modprobe ndiswrapper; sudo depmod -a;
2007-01-08T16:06:00.000Z	Sling	Tonren	this could be the issue, it says ERROR: Module bcm34xx does not exist in /proc/modules
2007-01-08T16:07:00.000Z	Tonren	Sling	Don't worry, that just means that bcm43xx wasn't already there.  We were removing (rm)ing it anyway.
2007-01-08T16:07:00.000Z	Tonren	Sling	OK.  Now that that's done.  Please pastebin the output of sudo iwconfig and sudo ifconfig
2007-01-08T16:08:00.000Z	Sling	Tonren	how do i pastebin
2007-01-08T16:09:00.000Z	Tonren	Sling	Type "/topic" into your IRC chat program and click on the "Pastes to" link
2007-01-08T16:10:00.000Z	Sling	Tonren	i can't exactly do a paste.... i'm on a different computer
2007-01-08T16:10:00.000Z	Tonren	Sling	Oh, of course.
2007-01-08T16:10:00.000Z	Sling	Tonren	when i plug it in i cannot get connect either....i can access the router, but i cannot access the intnet
2007-01-08T16:11:00.000Z	Tonren	Sling	That sounds like a DNS issue.
2007-01-08T16:11:00.000Z	Sling	Tonren	i thought about that, the forums say add the ISP DNS to the list......i don't understand that...how do i know the ISP DNS ip?
2007-01-08T16:11:00.000Z	Tonren	Sling	On your other computer, try navigating to this IP address in your browser; http://72.14.207.99
2007-01-08T16:12:00.000Z	Sling	Tonren	nope....didn't work
2007-01-08T16:12:00.000Z	Tonren	Sling	Hm.  OK, on your working computer, ping google.com and write down its IP address.  Then try navigating to that IP address in the browser of your laptop.
2007-01-08T16:13:00.000Z	Sling	Tonren	nothing
2007-01-08T16:14:00.000Z	Tonren	Sling	OK, it's not STRICTLY a DNS issue.  If it was, that would work.
2007-01-08T16:14:00.000Z	Sling	Tonren	yay
2007-01-08T16:14:00.000Z	Tonren	Sling	Unfortunately, I don't really have the time to help you in depth... I'm trying to figure out something on my own at the moment.
2007-01-08T16:14:00.000Z	Tonren	Sling	Umm... ok, summarize what you see when you type iwconfig and ifconfig
2007-01-08T16:14:00.000Z	Sling	Tonren	shucks...thanks anyways
