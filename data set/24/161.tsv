2012-09-20T07:01:00.000Z	pyrokinetic		hi everyone. recently removed my windows 7 partition and am now running ubuntu 12.04 full time, unfortunately I now have a TON of unallocated space that I can't seem to use, tried running gparted from liveCD and disabled swap so I could expand my extended partition, which worked, but now I just have unallocated space (along with my 'normal' partitions) within my extended partition...a little help would be super.
2012-09-20T07:03:00.000Z	jagginess	pyrokinetic	usually it's very hard to work with the extended partition, so people work best only at 4 partitions max (especially true on msdos partition style table-- but this worry doesnt exist on GPT)
2012-09-20T07:03:00.000Z	jagginess	pyrokinetic	and i mean 4 "primary" partitions..
2012-09-20T07:05:00.000Z	jagginess	pyrokinetic	if you just installed it, and there's no data to backup on the drive, the best /easiest solution-- would be less time to wipe out the drive and start from scratch
2012-09-20T07:05:00.000Z	pyrokinetic	jagginess	I've used it for a while unfortunately and have quite a bit of stuff. I thought about doing that tho
2012-09-20T07:06:00.000Z	jagginess	pyrokinetic	well if there's alot of unallocated space, it's best to backup the data, and start from scratch :/ unfortunately..
2012-09-20T07:10:00.000Z	jagginess	pyrokinetic	i thought you were talking about unallocated space outside the extended partition
2012-09-20T07:10:00.000Z	jagginess	pyrokinetic	if its only unallocated data within extended.. you shuold be able to resize the logical partitions within
2012-09-20T07:12:00.000Z	pyrokinetic	jagginess	sorry, I didn't explain very well....I have a screenshot on ubuntuforums.org (and a thread there under general help) ...not sure if you have an account there but it might illustrate my problem a bit better
2012-09-20T07:14:00.000Z	jagginess	pyrokinetic	i dont think i need a screenshot.. you can do-> fdisk -l<enter>
2012-09-20T07:15:00.000Z	pyrokinetic	jagginess	err, the command works but....nothing happens.
2012-09-20T07:15:00.000Z	jagginess	pyrokinetic	maybe use it with sudo
2012-09-20T07:16:00.000Z	pyrokinetic	jagginess	where do I paste?
2012-09-20T07:17:00.000Z	jagginess	pyrokinetic	dunno.. check the topic :/
2012-09-20T07:18:00.000Z	pyrokinetic	jagginess	http://paste.ubuntu.com/1216073/
2012-09-20T07:19:00.000Z	jagginess	pyrokinetic	so use gparted live cd and grow /dev/sda5 .. if this is "/" then you'll need to rerun grub-install /dev/sda
2012-09-20T07:20:00.000Z	pyrokinetic	jagginess	sda5 is /boot
2012-09-20T07:20:00.000Z	pyrokinetic	jagginess	sda6 is / and sda7 is /home
2012-09-20T07:21:00.000Z	pyrokinetic	jagginess	and my unallocated space also doesn't show up anywhere in the paste, but I'm guessing that's normal? or not..
2012-09-20T07:22:00.000Z	jagginess	pyrokinetic	well can you move /boot with gparted ? it wouldnt even be a hundred meg
2012-09-20T07:22:00.000Z	pyrokinetic	jagginess	that's the problem, I can't 'move' or resize anything :\
2012-09-20T07:23:00.000Z	jagginess	pyrokinetic	"gparted live cd".
2012-09-20T07:23:00.000Z	jagginess	pyrokinetic	http://gparted.sourceforge.net/livecd.php
2012-09-20T07:23:00.000Z	pyrokinetic	jagginess	that's what I've been using. doesn't work, can't move the sliders at all.
