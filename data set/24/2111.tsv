2009-04-11T21:39:00.000Z	icqn	Gurkan`	uninstall nvidia-glx-180
2009-04-11T21:40:00.000Z	icqn	Gurkan`	and install the previous working version nvidia-glx-170 or what ever
2009-04-11T21:40:00.000Z	Gurkan`	icqn	i did, and installed the previous driver (177). when i boot with that i get few errors, and i can only start in low graphics
2009-04-11T21:42:00.000Z	icqn	Gurkan`	i will be a lesson for you, that if everything is working awesome, do not change it, what have you install with (nvidia-glx), what other packages?
2009-04-11T21:42:00.000Z	icqn	Gurkan`	i -> it
2009-04-11T21:43:00.000Z	Gurkan`	icqn	this is my first use of ubuntu, so it never worked awesome ;) havent really installed anything else
2009-04-11T21:43:00.000Z	Gurkan`		Icqn, except the update of course
2009-04-11T21:44:00.000Z	icqn	Gurkan`	have you uninstalled nvidia-180-kernel-source - NVIDIA binary kernel module source
2009-04-11T21:44:00.000Z	icqn	Gurkan`	nvidia-180-modaliases - Modaliases for the NVIDIA binary X.Org driver
2009-04-11T21:45:00.000Z	Gurkan`	icqn	no i havent uninstalled any of them
2009-04-11T21:45:00.000Z	Gurkan`		(yet)
2009-04-11T21:45:00.000Z	icqn	Gurkan`	or better, once you are in the low mode resolution, go to the System ->Hardware->System Drivers menu
2009-04-11T21:46:00.000Z	Gurkan`	icqn	okay then, gotto reboot to low mode
2009-04-11T21:46:00.000Z	Gurkan`		brb
2009-04-11T21:52:00.000Z	Gurkan`	icqn	im in now, but the strange thing is that i got no errors this time
2009-04-11T21:52:00.000Z	Gurkan`		gonna check nvida-settings
2009-04-11T21:54:00.000Z	Gurkan`	icqn	cant change resolution or access the nvidia-settings, tells me that i dont have nvida-xorg running and tells me to run nvidia-xconfig. when i do that i get a runtime error
2009-04-11T21:55:00.000Z	icqn	Gurkan`	video driver is a thing you never want to update if it fulfills you needs, that is why there is three of them available 173, 177, 180 or even more...
2009-04-11T21:55:00.000Z	Gurkan`		validation error*
2009-04-11T21:56:00.000Z	Gurkan`	icqn	i had to, else i  couldnt change the screen resolution as i updated the drivers exactly after i did the first update.
2009-04-11T21:56:00.000Z	icqn	Gurkan`	goto System Administration  Hardware  Drivers menu and select the driver from there, install it and reboot
2009-04-11T21:56:00.000Z	Gurkan`	icqn	it was from there i choose the 180 version so i could change resolution and run dualmonitor
