2011-01-12T01:38:00.000Z	antlong	seul	sounds like bad ram or battery
2011-01-12T01:39:00.000Z	antlong	seul	its rare but it happens
2011-01-12T01:40:00.000Z	antlong	seul	the lack of being able to even get to bios is normally due to bad ram
2011-01-12T01:40:00.000Z	antlong	seul	do you see the tiny light, lit up on the motherboard
2011-01-12T01:41:00.000Z	seul	antlong	what are you talking about? I know what the battery is
2011-01-12T01:41:00.000Z	antlong	seul	what?
2011-01-12T01:41:00.000Z	seul	antlong	you were talking about some light in the pc or something
2011-01-12T01:41:00.000Z	antlong	seul	no, its a small led on the motherboard
2011-01-12T01:41:00.000Z	seul	antlong	i have a green light on it
2011-01-12T01:42:00.000Z	antlong	seul	how many ram chips do you have
2011-01-12T01:42:00.000Z	seul	antlong	2, at 2gig each
2011-01-12T01:42:00.000Z	antlong	seul	take one out and try to boot, if that doesnt work, put it back, take the other out and try to boot
2011-01-12T01:43:00.000Z	seul	antlong	ok, give me 5
2011-01-12T01:46:00.000Z	antlong	seul	no if the battery was dead it wouldnt do anything
2011-01-12T01:46:00.000Z	antlong	seul	maybe something got unseated? try to reseat your chips
2011-01-12T01:47:00.000Z	seul	antlong	what do you mean by geek squad? :P
2011-01-12T01:47:00.000Z	antlong	seul	http://www.geeksquad.com/
2011-01-12T01:49:00.000Z	antlong	seul	basically
2011-01-12T01:50:00.000Z	antlong	seul	this happened to me once before and it turned out to be a bad ram chip. i also took off the heatsink and cleaned it out, reseated all the chips and done a bunch of crap
2011-01-12T01:50:00.000Z	seul	antlong	wow, that sounds like something i would mess up. Maybe ill call the swedish equivalent of geek squad
2011-01-12T01:51:00.000Z	antlong	seul	just dont remove the heatsink (im assuming you dont have conductive gel to apply)
2011-01-12T01:51:00.000Z	seul	antlong	i probably wont remove anything. Sounds dangerous
2011-01-12T01:52:00.000Z	antlong	seul	if i was you i would take all the ram out, take the battery out and wait 5 mins
2011-01-12T01:52:00.000Z	seul	antlong	ok, ill remove a bunch of stuff and so on. brb
