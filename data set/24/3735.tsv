2007-10-26T17:19:00.000Z	coffee-n-cream		i cant get my nvidia to work..i got everything installed correctly.now i stop the x server,run as root nvidia-xconfig or edit xorg.conf replacing "nv" with "nvidia",i start x again by typing "startx" or "sudo invoke-rc.d gdm start" my x wont start at all.it will give me a black blank screen and hang there.
2007-10-26T17:20:00.000Z	coffee-n-cream		i have to use "nv" again to restart my x server.
2007-10-26T17:21:00.000Z	jrib	coffee-n-cream	why are you not using the restricted driver manager?
2007-10-26T17:21:00.000Z	coffee-n-cream	jrib	same thing happen too
2007-10-26T17:22:00.000Z	jrib	coffee-n-cream	what card
2007-10-26T17:23:00.000Z	jrib	coffee-n-cream	yes, but they are different.  You should ask in #debian
2007-10-26T17:38:00.000Z	jrib	coffee-n-cream	you need to ask in #debian, not here.  Debian and Ubuntu may have different issues and different resolutions
2007-10-26T17:39:00.000Z	jrib	coffee-n-cream	what version of ubuntu
2007-10-26T17:40:00.000Z	jrib	coffee-n-cream	get rid of what envy did, use restricted driver manager, reload X, then drop to a tty and copy /var/log/Xorg.0.log somewhere.  Then pastebin that for us to see
2007-10-26T17:57:00.000Z	coffee-n-cream	jrib	ive uninstalled envy,used restricted to install nvidia but in "Status" says Not in use but the Enabled is ticked
2007-10-26T17:58:00.000Z	jrib	coffee-n-cream	and restarted X?
2007-10-26T18:05:00.000Z	jrib	coffee-n-cream	ah, so it is working now?  Are you actually running the nvidia driver?
2007-10-26T18:11:00.000Z	coffee-n-cream	jrib	in xorg.conf under device driver has "nvidia" but when i select Extra or normal under Visual effects,a box popout saying desktop effects could not be enabled
2007-10-26T18:12:00.000Z	jrib	coffee-n-cream	'glxinfo | grep direct' returns?
2007-10-26T18:13:00.000Z	coffee-n-cream	jrib	Xlib:  extension "GLX" missing on display ":0.0". <-- 7 lines of them and Error: couldn't find RGB GLX visual
2007-10-26T18:14:00.000Z	jrib	coffee-n-cream	hmm, pastebin /etc/X11/xorg.conf and /var/log/Xorg.0.log
2007-10-26T18:15:00.000Z	coffee-n-cream	jrib	pastebin??

2007-10-26T18:34:00.000Z	jrib	coffee-n-cream	(EE) Failed to initialize GLX extension (Compatible NVIDIA X driver not found)
2007-10-26T18:35:00.000Z	coffee-n-cream	jrib	nvidia driver not installed?
2007-10-26T18:37:00.000Z	jrib	coffee-n-cream	well X can't find a decent one.  Try purging linux-restricted-modules-$(uname -r) and nvidia-glx*, rebooting and then using restricted driver manager again.  Read very carefully what the outcome of the commands are.  I also don't know what envy does and how to undo it so that is another factor
2007-10-26T18:40:00.000Z	coffee-n-cream	jrib	thanks.will try dat another day coz i really have to go.i guess ure still here tmr?
2007-10-26T18:40:00.000Z	jrib	coffee-n-cream	maybe, someone is always around though
2007-10-26T18:41:00.000Z	coffee-n-cream	jrib	ok thanks again to everybody who had helped me :)
