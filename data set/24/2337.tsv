2009-07-22T08:00:00.000Z	alex___	RocketLauncher	Have you gotten the lastest drivers + CCC off ATI's site?
2009-07-22T08:01:00.000Z	RocketLauncher	alex___	I got fglrx from restricted drivers. Should I get the drivers off ati.com ?
2009-07-22T08:01:00.000Z	alex___	RocketLauncher	Yeah, the one you got still gives you 9.4 which is impossible to set up dual monitors on. lol
2009-07-22T08:01:00.000Z	RocketLauncher	alex___	will ati's work with Ubuntu 8.10, which I'm usin
2009-07-22T08:02:00.000Z	alex___	RocketLauncher	They should. http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/Pages/index.aspx
2009-07-22T08:02:00.000Z	RocketLauncher	alex___	ok I'll try them
2009-07-22T08:02:00.000Z	alex___	RocketLauncher	Just pick if you have 32 bit or 64 bit then your model.
2009-07-22T08:03:00.000Z	alex___	RocketLauncher	To get dual monitors set up you will have to reboot about 5 times >.< lol
2009-07-22T08:03:00.000Z	RocketLauncher	alex___	https://a248.e.akamai.net/f/674/9206/0/www2.ati.com/drivers/linux/ati-driver-installer-9-6-x86.x86_64.run
2009-07-22T08:03:00.000Z	alex___	RocketLauncher	Looks good
2009-07-22T08:04:00.000Z	alex___	RocketLauncher	Make sure to back up any important data before trying Xinerama... When I tried to use it, it made linux unable to boot. lol
2009-07-22T08:04:00.000Z	RocketLauncher	alex___	Wait how do I try xinerama?
2009-07-22T08:06:00.000Z	RocketLauncher	alex___	when I try to run ati-driver-installer-9-6-x86.x86_64.run  it says "Permission denied"
2009-07-22T08:07:00.000Z	alex___	RocketLauncher	1. Did you make it executable? 2. You have to run it through terminal with sudo.
2009-07-22T08:08:00.000Z	RocketLauncher	alex___	I did it wrong. I'm installing now
2009-07-22T08:08:00.000Z	RocketLauncher	alex___	do I select "Generate Distribution Specific Driver Package" or "install driver on xorg 7.4 and later releases"
2009-07-22T08:09:00.000Z	alex___	RocketLauncher	Install driver on xorg 7.4 and later
2009-07-22T08:09:00.000Z	alex___	RocketLauncher	And you can just do the automatic instead of custom.
2009-07-22T08:10:00.000Z	RocketLauncher	alex___	Ok already did that. What do I do when it's done? It's done now
2009-07-22T08:10:00.000Z	alex___	RocketLauncher	It should have said please reboot your computer =P
2009-07-22T08:11:00.000Z	RocketLauncher	alex___	Alright brb, hopefully
2009-07-22T08:12:00.000Z	RocketLauncher	alex___	now what do I do
2009-07-22T08:17:00.000Z	alex___	RocketLauncher	All seems well?
2009-07-22T08:17:00.000Z	RocketLauncher	alex___	I got it working.
