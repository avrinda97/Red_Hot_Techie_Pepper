2009-07-25T02:24:00.000Z	mazda01_	th0r	is vnc4server any faster than x11vnc?
2009-07-25T19:19:00.000Z	mazda01_	th0r	i have a router with built in hardware firewall, so I am glad I don't have to play around with software firewall
2009-07-25T19:20:00.000Z	th0r	mazda01_	yeah, I liked having a router, but now I depend on open wifi at marinas and such so....
2009-07-25T19:21:00.000Z	mazda01_	th0r	oh I see. i don't use open wifi very often but when I do I should setup some good rules with iptables for when I do go out with the laptop
2009-07-25T19:22:00.000Z	th0r	mazda01_	that is why I like firestarter. It defaults to letting nothing in, and it is easy to define new policy exceptions
2009-07-25T19:22:00.000Z	th0r	mazda01_	not all of us are trying to rule the world...sometimes easy is good enough
2009-07-25T19:22:00.000Z	mazda01_	th0r	what do you mean?
2009-07-25T19:23:00.000Z	th0r	mazda01_	if you look at the other options mentioned....fwbuilder, shorewall, gufw, they all allow you to do LOTS of things with the firewall, but they are all cumbersome to use. Sometimes, like the old movie line, do one thing, do it well, then move on
2009-07-25T19:26:00.000Z	mazda01_	th0r	so you're saying that just using iptables staright away instead of messing with gui's is the easiest? there are so many guides for adding rules for iptables.
2009-07-25T19:27:00.000Z	th0r	mazda01_	I have used iptables a lot, but now that it isn't my JOB anymore it is nice to just open a gui, type in a port number, and click apply
2009-07-25T19:28:00.000Z	mazda01_	th0r	and which gui is that easy?
2009-07-25T19:28:00.000Z	th0r	mazda01_	I use nonstandard ports for all my services...well...I run almost everything via a tunnel on a non-standard ssh port. So I need to open and shut ports as I need them.
2009-07-25T19:28:00.000Z	th0r	mazda01_	firestarter
2009-07-25T19:28:00.000Z	mazda01_	th0r	 got it
2009-07-25T19:29:00.000Z	th0r	mazda01_	have you tried firestarter? It really is worth a look...too bad they stopped supporting it. But I have frozen my install so I don't have to worry about that
2009-07-25T19:30:00.000Z	mazda01_	th0r	i don't need to mess iwth it now because I am behind a hardware firewall but when I go out with my laptop, i'll look into it.
2009-07-25T19:31:00.000Z	th0r	mazda01_	exactly, it is worth putting on the laptop so when you do go out you have it. Never know what kind of config you need at a given site, and firestarter makes it really easy to reconfigure
2009-07-25T19:31:00.000Z	th0r	mazda01_	I am cruising on a sailboat, so I never know where my next net access will come from.
2009-07-25T20:31:00.000Z	mazda01_	th0r	don
2009-07-25T20:31:00.000Z	mazda01_	th0r	doesn't ssh attempts get logged to auth.log
2009-07-25T20:31:00.000Z	th0r	mazda01_	I think so there too....but I always just checked messages
2009-08-11T06:45:00.000Z	mazda01_	th0r	+1
2009-08-11T06:50:00.000Z	th0r	mazda01_	type man man and find out
2009-08-11T06:51:00.000Z	mazda01_	th0r	HA, there's a man page for man. awesome
