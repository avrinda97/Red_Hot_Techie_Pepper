2012-07-08T07:34:00.000Z	kiamo		I'm getting erros while processing: fglrx, fglrx-amdcccle
2012-07-08T07:34:00.000Z	kiamo		Looks like ATI driver problems (which only got half installed)
2012-07-08T07:35:00.000Z	L3top	kiamo	lspci -nn | grep VGA
2012-07-08T07:39:00.000Z	L3top	kiamo	Why did it only half install? What errors did it encounter? And are you on another machine, and that is why you did not give me the full output?
2012-07-08T07:39:00.000Z	L3top	kiamo	sudo dpkg --configure -a
2012-07-08T07:42:00.000Z	L3top	kiamo	sudo apt-get -f install
2012-07-08T07:43:00.000Z	L3top	kiamo	second verse same as the first
2012-07-08T07:44:00.000Z	kiamo	L3top	what do you mean?  second verse same as the first?
2012-07-08T07:44:00.000Z	L3top	kiamo	I meant only that I wanted to know, success or failure, if any output at all again. Can you please sudo apt-get install pastebinit so that I can see larger output?
2012-07-08T07:46:00.000Z	kiamo	L3top	I uninstalled the ATI things giving me errors, and now when I load x screen remains black
2012-07-08T07:48:00.000Z	L3top	kiamo	one moment please.
2012-07-08T07:49:00.000Z	kiamo	L3top	no prob :)
2012-07-08T07:49:00.000Z	L3top	kiamo	can you open a web page on your current machine?

2012-07-08T07:55:00.000Z	kiamo	L3top	Reinstallation of xserver-xorg-core is not possible, it cannot be downloaded.
2012-07-08T07:55:00.000Z	L3top	kiamo	lsb_release -sc
2012-07-08T07:56:00.000Z	L3top	kiamo	I really need to see your sources.list at this point. Is there any way you can ssh into this machine
2012-07-08T07:57:00.000Z	kiamo	L3top	aah ok...
2012-07-08T07:58:00.000Z	kiamo	L3top	yea no worries.  I didn't think it would be so different.  My bad ^^
2012-07-08T07:59:00.000Z	L3top	kiamo	there is a backtrack chan on freenode. I believe you have to register.
2012-07-08T08:00:00.000Z	kiamo	L3top	thanks for the help thus far :D
2012-07-08T08:00:00.000Z	L3top	kiamo	you can try to continue those steps. They may get you somewhere.
