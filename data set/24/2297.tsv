2009-02-07T18:20:00.000Z	ikonia	fran69	check the pm ubottu sent you
2009-02-07T18:21:00.000Z	ikonia	fran69	then ask them
2009-02-07T18:23:00.000Z	ikonia	fran69	ok
2009-02-07T18:24:00.000Z	fran69	ikonia	right? then i have to configure the second NIC as an static IP
2009-02-07T18:24:00.000Z	ikonia	fran69	yes, that would be a sensible move
2009-02-07T18:25:00.000Z	fran69	ikonia	question... which command in linux show me the ip that is configured in al my NICs ?
2009-02-07T18:25:00.000Z	ikonia	fran69	ifconfig -a
2009-02-07T18:26:00.000Z	ikonia	fran69	however you can just use the gui in "system -> preferences -> networking configuration" to make it easy
2009-02-07T18:26:00.000Z	fran69	ikonia	i am using just coommand lines... it is faster
2009-02-07T18:27:00.000Z	ikonia	fran69	not if you don't know what you're doing
2009-02-07T18:28:00.000Z	fran69	ikonia	my eth0 says this: inet dirección:169.254.8.237  Difusión:169.254.255.255  Máscara:255.255.0.0
2009-02-07T18:28:00.000Z	ikonia	fran69	ok ?
2009-02-07T18:28:00.000Z	fran69	ikonia	I did not tell linux use that ip
2009-02-07T18:29:00.000Z	ikonia	fran69	it's dhcp - you told me it was dhcp
2009-02-07T18:29:00.000Z	fran69	ikonia	no, y use DHCP in eth0... the internet conection use that conf
2009-02-07T18:30:00.000Z	ikonia	fran69	what ?
2009-02-07T18:30:00.000Z	ikonia	fran69	eth0 is dhcp - so that's why that IP address is on your eth0 config
2009-02-07T18:32:00.000Z	fran69	ikonia	you are RIGHT! ,well,  i have tu use eth1 to share with win xp... what should i do then? do i have to configure eth1 ?
2009-02-07T18:34:00.000Z	fran69	ikonia	i think i have to read the link you sent me, and then come back if I have any doubt...
