2007-01-04T06:13:00.000Z	jakob		can someone tell me what this means "dpkg was interrupted, you must manually run 'dpkg --configure -a' to correct the problem."
2007-01-04T06:14:00.000Z	agent	jakob	that means some piece of software did not finish configuring itself when you updated or installed it
2007-01-04T06:16:00.000Z	agent	jakob	why are you trying to install vmware? vmware is not freedom software.... try qemu or, must faster than vwmware or qemu, xen
2007-01-04T06:17:00.000Z	agent	jakob	find out the package name of vmware (may be just vmware) and try: sudo apt-get remove --purge vmware
2007-01-04T06:18:00.000Z	agent	jakob	if that does not work, try: sudo apt-get -f install
2007-01-04T06:20:00.000Z	jakob	agent	tried the "sudo apt-get -f install" it gave me the same output
2007-01-04T06:22:00.000Z	agent	jakob	what about: sudo dpkg --purge vmware
2007-01-04T06:23:00.000Z	agent	jakob	and why did you try to install vmware!
2007-01-04T06:23:00.000Z	agent	jakob	do you use automatix or some other software like it?
2007-01-04T06:24:00.000Z	jakob	agent	yes I did
2007-01-04T06:25:00.000Z	jakob	agent	how about the add/remove mentioned in the programs tab
2007-01-04T06:25:00.000Z	agent	jakob	try the automatix channel, but don't tell them automatix broke your install (even though it did) because they all have very big egos and will not help you
2007-01-04T06:25:00.000Z	jakob	agent	lol. I think I might have fixed it, I tried uninstalling it through automatix and though it gave me an error it seems it's now gone
2007-01-04T06:25:00.000Z	agent	jakob	not sure which add/remove you are talking about, but you can always try it.... you have to realize that synaptic and add/remove both use apt-get
2007-01-04T06:26:00.000Z	agent	jakob	do yourself a favor and remove automatix before you break something else :)
2007-01-04T06:27:00.000Z	jakob	agent	do you know how I get to the automatix channel?
2007-01-04T06:28:00.000Z	agent	jakob	also, run sudo apt-get -f install and then sudo dpkg --configure -a
2007-01-04T06:28:00.000Z	agent	jakob	not sure what it is, but you can try typing in /j #automatix
2007-01-04T06:28:00.000Z	agent	jakob	#automatix is the channel that i am guessing and /j is short of /join
2007-01-04T06:28:00.000Z	jakob	agent	I finally got it fixed. Apparantly I was able to click ok within the vmware text and click don't accept
2007-01-04T06:29:00.000Z	agent	jakob	now just run what i mentioned above to make sure everything is clean and remove automatix :)
2007-01-04T06:29:00.000Z	agent	jakob	friends don't let friends run automatix
2007-01-04T06:42:00.000Z	agent	jakob	that pages has instructions on java amd64
2007-01-04T06:44:00.000Z	jakob	agent	I have java installed, I just need a plugin for mozilla
