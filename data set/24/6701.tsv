2007-10-10T11:45:00.000Z	nickrud	lee__	please don
2007-10-10T12:08:00.000Z	nickrud	lee__	no, install it into wine. (and beryl is a pretty window manager)
2007-10-10T12:08:00.000Z	nickrud	lee__	with a gun?
2007-10-10T12:09:00.000Z	nickrud	lee__	beryl is dead software already, it's been replaced by compiz-fusion. In 9 days, you can install it with gutsy. I'd suggest not even worrying about beryl
2007-10-10T12:12:00.000Z	nickrud	lee__	what kind of video card do you have?
2007-10-10T12:13:00.000Z	lee__	nickrud	i have an ati x300
2007-10-10T12:14:00.000Z	nickrud	lee__	no compiz for us, then. The ati drivers don't support it. You will be able to use compiz-fusion in gutsy, though.
2007-10-10T12:16:00.000Z	lee__	nickrud	I have gutsy, i went to load compiz..it said it was the latest version
2007-10-10T12:19:00.000Z	lee__	nickrud	I  have opengl
2007-10-10T12:21:00.000Z	nickrud	lee__	read that page I gave you, it tells you what you _have_ to do
2007-10-10T12:25:00.000Z	nickrud	lee__	three d is not enough for ati. You must run the xserver-xgl
2007-10-10T12:34:00.000Z	nickrud	lee__	I don't know?
2007-10-10T12:35:00.000Z	lee__	nickrud	i have the catylysy control and it tookaway a few of the features? plus this 60 mhz gives me a headache lol
2007-10-10T12:36:00.000Z	nickrud	lee__	I don't use the drivers from ati, but from the repos. I have no clue about how to help you with that
