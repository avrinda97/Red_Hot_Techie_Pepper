2005-10-18T05:40:00.000Z	TylerDurden		how do i install .ebuilds?
2005-10-18T05:41:00.000Z	TylerDurden		i need to install this one file
2005-10-18T05:41:00.000Z	TylerDurden		nitro-sources-2.6.13.2-r1.ebuild crimsun
2005-10-18T05:42:00.000Z	TylerDurden		can u explain a little please crimsun
2005-10-18T05:43:00.000Z	willert	TylerDurden	Have a look at apt-get.org, maybe you can find a .deb file to install there
2005-10-18T05:43:00.000Z	TylerDurden	willert	can i just convert that ebuild into a deb?
2005-10-18T05:44:00.000Z	willert	TylerDurden	no, I dont think so. You can convert rpm-packages with alien, but I fear you are out of luck with ebuilds
2005-10-18T05:46:00.000Z	willert	TylerDurden	As far as I know .ebuilds only contain infos about how to build a source distribution and no binaries at all so downloading the .tar.gz file and running './configure && make && make install' shouldn't be much more complicated
2005-10-18T05:47:00.000Z	willert	TylerDurden	I've never used an ebiuld distro though, so take this info with a grain of salt
2005-10-18T05:47:00.000Z	TylerDurden	willert	this is whats in the ebuild http://paste.ubuntulinux.nl/3029
2005-10-18T05:49:00.000Z	willert	TylerDurden	Wow, installing a kernel on your own is not so easy, one moment ...
2005-10-18T05:49:00.000Z	TylerDurden	willert	i already did
2005-10-18T05:49:00.000Z	TylerDurden	willert	but i compiled a regular one using a guide, i didnt use this file or anythimg. im very confused on what to do with this file
2005-10-18T05:50:00.000Z	willert	TylerDurden	http://users.pandora.be/seppe/nitro/2.6.13.2-nitro1/series contains an installation instruction
2005-10-18T05:50:00.000Z	TylerDurden	willert	it says download somefile.bz2 but idk where to find it :S
2005-10-18T05:51:00.000Z	willert	TylerDurden	just leave out the 'series', its in the same dir
2005-10-18T05:51:00.000Z	TylerDurden	willert	i see a patch-filename.bz2 but thats a patch
2005-10-18T05:54:00.000Z	willert	TylerDurden	Sorry, I am not registered... ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/linux-2.6.13.2.tar.bz2 contains the sources you need to patch like described in the 'series' file
2005-10-18T07:36:00.000Z	willert	TylerDurden	welcome back... what happend?
