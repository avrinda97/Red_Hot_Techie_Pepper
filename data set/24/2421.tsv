2009-01-28T19:09:00.000Z	shadeslayer		on my XPS M1530
2009-01-28T19:09:00.000Z	shadeslayer		they do this in windows
2009-01-28T19:09:00.000Z	shadeslayer		Fn+F3:battery meter
2009-01-28T19:09:00.000Z	shadeslayer		wireless button:finding nearby networks
2009-01-28T19:09:00.000Z	shadeslayer		i know that ill have to remap those button's
2009-01-28T19:09:00.000Z	shadeslayer		just dont know how
2009-01-28T19:10:00.000Z	shadeslayer		both of them give scancodes with xev
2009-01-28T19:10:00.000Z	shadeslayer		lol
2009-01-28T19:10:00.000Z	nickrud	shadeslayer	you'd need to use xmodmap
2009-01-28T19:12:00.000Z	nickrud	shadeslayer	that's a bug subject; exactly what do you want one key that xev sees to do?
2009-01-28T19:13:00.000Z	nickrud	shadeslayer	s/bug/big/
2009-01-28T19:13:00.000Z	nickrud	shadeslayer	that's a typo correction
2009-01-28T19:14:00.000Z	nickrud	shadeslayer	do you know the command for a battery meter? Or are you talking about the hardware one?
2009-01-28T19:15:00.000Z	nickrud	shadeslayer	ah. I'd bet those are apps in windows -- I'm not sure that there are exact equivs in ubuntu.
2009-01-28T19:15:00.000Z	shadeslayer	nickrud	hmm
2009-01-28T19:15:00.000Z	nickrud	shadeslayer	if booksbuggy has apps, you can .... not panel apps :)
2009-01-28T19:17:00.000Z	nickrud	shadeslayer	anyway, if you identify some you can go to  /apps/metacity/keybindings and keybindings_commands and associate apps to those. Use 0x000 as keybindings
2009-01-28T19:17:00.000Z	nickrud	shadeslayer	where 0x0e3 might be an output from xev
2009-01-28T19:18:00.000Z	nickrud	shadeslayer	type  alt-f2  gconf-editor
2009-01-28T19:19:00.000Z	nickrud	shadeslayer	that opens a tool you can manipulate a lot of settings. Oh. Kubuntu. I have no clue
2009-01-28T19:19:00.000Z	nickrud	shadeslayer	but the idea is the same, #kubuntu can give you the right tool names to assign actions to keys
2009-01-28T19:20:00.000Z	nickrud	shadeslayer	the basic idea is to assign the value provided by xev to an action; when you press the key the action will happen. Find the tool, shadeslayer  ;)
