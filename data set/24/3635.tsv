2007-12-03T03:31:00.000Z	adamonline45		hello everyone.  I got madwifi installed ok, and modprobed it, but I don't see my device, as the tutorial says I should.  Does anyone know what could be wrong?
2007-12-03T03:32:00.000Z	Triskaidekaphobi	adamonline45	what wifi card are you using?
2007-12-03T03:33:00.000Z	adamonline45	Triskaidekaphobi	It uses the net5416 driver, the model name I'm not sure of.  But I got to the point where I was able to at least see the card in iwconfig before I reinstalled Ubuntu, so I'm sure it's supported.
2007-12-03T03:37:00.000Z	Triskaidekaphobi	adamonline45	from a terminal execute: sudo lspci -nnv > ~/adamlspci and paste it on postbin
2007-12-03T03:39:00.000Z	Triskaidekaphobi	adamonline45	then post the url of your pastebin page here and i'll (we'll) have a look

2007-12-03T03:43:00.000Z	adamonline45	Triskaidekaphobi	The wireless card is on line 129
2007-12-03T03:44:00.000Z	Triskaidekaphobi	adamonline45	Try this: http://ubuntu-tutorials.com/2007/03/18/how-to-configure-wireless-on-a-macbook-using-ndiswrapper/ ... Note: you need the latest version of ndiswrapper to get then functioning properly (i did too), so remove if it's currently installed, grab the source, and compile...
2007-12-03T03:45:00.000Z	adamonline45	Triskaidekaphobi	I got ndsiwrapper working, and I'd prefer to use it, but there's no 64-bit XP driver for my card...
2007-12-03T03:46:00.000Z	adamonline45	Triskaidekaphobi	So, it wasn't actually _working_, of course...  But it would have if I had a 64-bit drvier 8)
2007-12-03T03:54:00.000Z	Triskaidekaphobi	adamonline45	yes, 64-bit seems to be an issue... let me check a couple of things... brb
2007-12-03T03:54:00.000Z	adamonline45	Triskaidekaphobi	Alright, thank you :)  i'll be here!
2007-12-03T04:13:00.000Z	Triskaidekaphobi	adamonline45	madwifi. The stable tree of that driver does not support this recent chipset yet (as of 2007/04/18), but there is a beta branch with a more recent hal with basic support. However, only unencrypted connections work at the moment with that branch, WPA is still broken. (page: http://en.opensuse.org/MacBook_Pro_Specials#Networking_.2F_WLAN )
2007-12-03T04:21:00.000Z	adamonline45	Triskaidekaphobi	Do you know what it means when it says "AR5008 support is available in trunk"?
2007-12-03T04:27:00.000Z	Triskaidekaphobi	adamonline45	'trunk' is the current development trunk, still beta software
2007-12-03T04:29:00.000Z	Triskaidekaphobi	adamonline45	think of a tree and branches the finished one is grafted into the stable release and the other tree is still growing, not yet ready for grafting into the stable release.
2007-12-03T04:29:00.000Z	adamonline45	Triskaidekaphobi	Ahh.  Dang, I'm thinking I should just isntall the 32-bit version and use ndiswrapper. :/  But I had a problem in 32-bit version, I was unable to get ndiswrapper as far installed as I have it now, on the 64-bit install.  Something about ndiswrapper.ko missing.  :( Hmmm...
2007-12-03T04:30:00.000Z	adamonline45	Triskaidekaphobi	Hehheh, I get it 8)
2007-12-03T04:30:00.000Z	Triskaidekaphobi	adamonline45	that's what MANY people have had to do for their own sanity...
2007-12-03T04:31:00.000Z	adamonline45	Triskaidekaphobi	I'm goin' on a few days, that's for sure.  Sigh.  Oh well, I think I've decided to do a 32-bit install.  Shucks...  i guess it's an _investment_ in sanity, ya gotta spend some to make some :)
2007-12-03T04:32:00.000Z	Triskaidekaphobi	adamonline45	so true, keep looking for the madwifi to go stable and then maybe try again...
2007-12-03T04:32:00.000Z	adamonline45	Triskaidekaphobi	My thoughts exactly
2007-12-03T04:33:00.000Z	adamonline45	Triskaidekaphobi	Well, thank you for your help!  I appreciate it :)
2007-12-03T04:33:00.000Z	Triskaidekaphobi	adamonline45	hopefully, that's what everyone's here for... good luck
