2007-07-01T13:30:00.000Z	countzero		how can I find my external harddisk?
2007-07-01T13:30:00.000Z	countzero		you're right! It was sitting on the shelf.
2007-07-01T13:30:00.000Z	countzero		Trouble is I can't get the computer to find it.
2007-07-01T13:30:00.000Z	countzero		no.
2007-07-01T13:30:00.000Z	countzero		it says the volume can't be mounted.
2007-07-01T13:30:00.000Z	countzero		ntfs
2007-07-01T13:30:00.000Z	countzero		could I get the addy to paste the gibberish?
2007-07-01T13:30:00.000Z	Anlar	countzero	if it's flagged dirty, just -f .. but you'd better off with ntfs-3g (install it, then -t ntfs-3g) anyways
2007-07-01T13:57:00.000Z	Anlar	countzero	just do something like sudo mount -f -t ntfs-3g /dev/sda1 (or where ever it was again) /media/whatever for once and it'll fix it.
2007-07-01T13:58:00.000Z	Anlar	countzero	"sudo apt-get install ntfs-3g" and "sudo mount -f -t ntfs-3g /dev/sdb1 /media/sdb1"
2007-07-01T13:58:00.000Z	Anlar	countzero	and later it should pop up automatically on your desktop after a clean umount /dev/sdb1 and unplugging/plugging back
2007-07-01T14:00:00.000Z	Anlar	countzero	that's entirely unnecessary, to format it
2007-07-01T14:01:00.000Z	countzero	Anlar	ok, how do I clean up the partitions again?
2007-07-01T14:04:00.000Z	countzero	Anlar	what is the mount command?
2007-07-01T14:05:00.000Z	Anlar	countzero	"sudo mount -f -t ntfs-3g /dev/sdb1 /media/sdb1"
2007-07-01T14:08:00.000Z	countzero	Anlar	I got a messaage that it is unclean, and got a tip to install ntfsfix version 1.13.1
2007-07-01T14:08:00.000Z	Anlar	countzero	was the -f there?
2007-07-01T14:09:00.000Z	countzero	Anlar	no, it wasn't.
2007-07-01T14:09:00.000Z	Anlar	countzero	well, ...
2007-07-01T14:10:00.000Z	countzero	Anlar	thank you for your suggestions. Can you help me reformat the drive instead?
2007-07-01T14:10:00.000Z	Anlar	countzero	why? there is absolutely no need to reformat it, just use -f and it will get fixed and work happily ever after.
2007-07-01T14:11:00.000Z	countzero	Anlar	I might be a bit dim, but I have still no idea on how to use -f
2007-07-01T14:11:00.000Z	Anlar	countzero	"sudo mount -f -t ntfs-3g /dev/sdb1 /media/sdb1"
