2009-03-28T00:24:00.000Z	usser	ChotaZ	sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras
2009-03-28T00:25:00.000Z	usser	ChotaZ	that should get you everything in terms of multimedia, and yea switch to ubuntu, kde 4 is just not usable
2009-03-28T00:25:00.000Z	usser	ChotaZ	yet
2009-03-28T00:25:00.000Z	usser	ChotaZ	sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
2009-03-28T00:26:00.000Z	usser	ChotaZ	no, it will add gnome to kde, you'll have to hunt down the packages manually to completely remove kde hang on

2009-03-28T00:38:00.000Z	usser	ChotaZ	sudo dpkg --configure 0a
2009-03-28T00:41:00.000Z	usser	ChotaZ	replace it you mean with gdm?
2009-03-28T00:42:00.000Z	ChotaZ	usser	it says that kdm is tipically stopped when removing  or updatin pkgs, if I stop it now, all sessions will be terminated, otherwise the 'new version' will take effect on next reboot. Yes No.
2009-03-28T00:43:00.000Z	usser	ChotaZ	select no, it just means you'll have to reboot, if you stop you'll lose your gui
2009-03-28T00:43:00.000Z	usser	ChotaZ	yep it should
2009-03-28T00:58:00.000Z	ChotaZ	usser	all done.
2009-03-28T01:16:00.000Z	ChotaZ	usser	check your pms when you have the time to
2009-03-28T01:29:00.000Z	usser	ChotaZ	i don't know which one you downloaded? either way install flashplugin-nonfree should take care of it
2009-03-28T01:32:00.000Z	usser	ChotaZ	just run uname -a to find out what version of ubuntu you're running, 32 or 64 bit
2009-03-28T01:35:00.000Z	ChotaZ	usser	what was the name of the music player again?

2009-03-28T01:50:00.000Z	usser	ChotaZ	oh sorry, exaile
2009-03-28T01:57:00.000Z	usser	ChotaZ	right click on the audio file open with-> exaile, check do this for all files
2009-03-28T01:58:00.000Z	usser	ChotaZ	but exaile is not the kind of an app you use to just double click on files, it works best if you create a collection
