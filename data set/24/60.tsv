2012-09-12T18:35:00.000Z	finga_		hi i use mixxx as dj software, but cannot find my cdrom, how can i make it work?
2012-09-12T18:36:00.000Z	dr_willis	finga_	 normally its /dev/cdrom but in some cases ive seen it be /devcdrom0 or cdrom1,   /dev/sr0 should also be the optical drive
2012-09-12T18:37:00.000Z	dr_willis	finga_	 because cdda: is a specual type url.
2012-09-12T18:38:00.000Z	dr_willis	finga_	 tell it /dev/cdrom perhaps
2012-09-12T18:38:00.000Z	dr_willis	finga_	 or /dev/sr0
2012-09-12T18:38:00.000Z	finga_	dr_willis	sr0 and cdrom in /dev are both not there
2012-09-12T18:39:00.000Z	dr_willis	finga_	 that is weird.
2012-09-12T18:39:00.000Z	finga_	dr_willis	jup xD
2012-09-12T18:39:00.000Z	dr_willis	finga_	 pop in cd. check dmesg command for errors perhaps
2012-09-12T18:41:00.000Z	finga_	dr_willis	dmesg throws no error with cdrom
2012-09-12T18:43:00.000Z	dr_willis	finga_	 does the cd evn spin up? can  the media players play it
2012-09-12T18:44:00.000Z	finga_	dr_willis	yea autostart is working and i can play it in vlc, i also tried to cope the path from vlc to mixxx, but its not working either
2012-09-12T18:44:00.000Z	dr_willis	finga_	 what path did vlc use?
2012-09-12T18:46:00.000Z	finga_	dr_willis	cdda:///dev/sr0
2012-09-12T18:47:00.000Z	dr_willis	finga_	 and ls -l /dev/sr0   shows nothing?
2012-09-12T18:47:00.000Z	finga_	dr_willis	it shows just /dev/sr0
2012-09-12T18:48:00.000Z	finga_	dr_willis	and /dev/sr0/ says its not a folder
2012-09-12T18:48:00.000Z	finga_	dr_willis	ahhh now i have it lol
2012-09-12T18:48:00.000Z	dr_willis	finga_	 thats because its NOT a folder. its a device
2012-09-12T18:49:00.000Z	finga_	dr_willis	yea i think i can also mount it in shell but its for a user who as no idea about the shell
2012-09-12T18:49:00.000Z	dr_willis	finga_	 you do NOT mount a music cd.
2012-09-12T18:50:00.000Z	finga_	dr_willis	aha ok, but any way i cant use it in mixxx
2012-09-12T18:50:00.000Z	finga_	dr_willis	ok ^^ i will try #mixxx too thx a lot anyhow
2012-09-12T18:52:00.000Z	finga_	dr_willis	yea that will be the workaround xD
