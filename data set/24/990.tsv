2010-09-18T18:35:00.000Z	Gnea	viral__	your grub.cfg

2010-09-18T18:39:00.000Z	viral__	Gnea	http://pastebin.com/DNxSz1ev
2010-09-18T18:41:00.000Z	Gnea	viral__	so you're using the second partition of the second hard drive?

2010-09-18T18:45:00.000Z	Gnea	viral__	http://blogs.koolwal.net/2008/12/28/windows-xpvista-dual-boot-does-not-boot-from-grub2-or-grub-pc/
2010-09-18T18:45:00.000Z	Gnea	viral__	I'm not seeing a windows entry in your grub.cfg
2010-09-18T18:46:00.000Z	viral__	Gnea	I removed it under the advice of mr_hai
2010-09-18T18:47:00.000Z	Gnea	viral__	okay. try adding it back, making sure you have the correct drive listed there. notice how it's using (1,1) for your ubuntu stuff - that's the second partition of the second hard drive
2010-09-18T18:48:00.000Z	viral__	Gnea	Yeah, I had (hd0,1) at first, which i think gave me a 'no such partition error', then tried (hd0,0) which said invalid signature
2010-09-18T18:48:00.000Z	Gnea	viral__	okay heh, do you recall which drive you installed windows to?
2010-09-18T18:51:00.000Z	viral__	Gnea	If it helps, windows was the first OS I installed, before I added any other HDDs or OSs. I think (physically) it's the middle of the 3 drives, if that helps at al
2010-09-18T18:51:00.000Z	Gnea	viral__	well, not sure how it would be on a 'middle' partition..
2010-09-18T18:52:00.000Z	Gnea	viral__	well as I see it, if you have 3 hdds, you've got ubuntu on the middle drive already
2010-09-18T18:53:00.000Z	viral__	Gnea	I'm finding with that tutorial you linked, when updating grub2 I don't get the 'adding windows' echo, That a problem?
2010-09-18T18:53:00.000Z	Gnea	viral__	the idea isn't to paste in all of that code - it's only use is for the specific application being used - obviously, you'll want to use only the portions specific to grub.cfg
2010-09-18T18:56:00.000Z	Gnea	viral__	cheers
