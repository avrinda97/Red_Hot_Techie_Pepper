2008-06-09T03:28:00.000Z	theFATMAN		how do i delete a file when rm doesnt work or force?
2008-06-09T03:29:00.000Z	shelbyscates	theFATMAN	sudo rm ./yourfile
2008-06-09T03:30:00.000Z	shelbyscates	theFATMAN	enter the directory its in, and type: 'sudo rm ./(yourfilehere)' without the quotes or parenthesies
2008-06-09T03:31:00.000Z	theFATMAN	shelbyscates	i did that, thats what is mindboggling about it
2008-06-09T03:31:00.000Z	shelbyscates	theFATMAN	sometimes you have to tell it the full path to the file you wanna delete.
2008-06-09T03:31:00.000Z	shelbyscates	theFATMAN	hhhhm. :\
2008-06-09T03:31:00.000Z	theFATMAN	shelbyscates	it's on my desktop, lol, so....
2008-06-09T03:32:00.000Z	shelbyscates	theFATMAN	is it a simple file or is it a directory?
2008-06-09T03:32:00.000Z	shelbyscates	theFATMAN	hhm.....
2008-06-09T03:32:00.000Z	shelbyscates	theFATMAN	 does ls -a show the file?
2008-06-09T03:34:00.000Z	shelbyscates	theFATMAN	just open your hard drive and move the bits to the trash with a butter knife! (WARNING: this action can not be undone!"
2008-06-09T03:36:00.000Z	shelbyscates	theFATMAN	this is what i would do: open nautilus and navigate to your desktop, fine the image, and drag the image to the trash (the little orange square in the bottom left of your screen)
2008-06-09T03:37:00.000Z	shelbyscates	theFATMAN	did that work?
2008-06-09T03:39:00.000Z	shelbyscates	theFATMAN	can you open it?
2008-06-09T03:41:00.000Z	shelbyscates	theFATMAN	:(
2008-06-09T03:41:00.000Z	shelbyscates	theFATMAN	try threatening your computer with a ubuntu install cd, they usually comply
2008-06-09T03:42:00.000Z	shelbyscates	theFATMAN	try booting from "failsafe gnome" or "failsafe terminal" and doing it from there ?
2008-06-09T03:44:00.000Z	shelbyscates	theFATMAN	thats odd
2008-06-09T03:45:00.000Z	shelbyscates	theFATMAN	rofl
2008-06-09T03:48:00.000Z	shelbyscates	theFATMAN	thats a really weird problem.... can you move the picture to another directory?
2008-06-09T03:49:00.000Z	shelbyscates	theFATMAN	i might try moving it to a directory called "cache" on my desktop, and running 'sudo rm -rf ~/Desktop/cache/'
2008-06-09T03:50:00.000Z	shelbyscates	theFATMAN	whats wrong?
2008-06-09T03:53:00.000Z	shelbyscates	theFATMAN	try downloading another random picture of the same format, and saving it on your desktop, then rename it under the same name as the one you wanna delete, and if it *really* dosent exist, it should get replaced, and then you can delete the second one
2008-06-09T03:55:00.000Z	shelbyscates	theFATMAN	do you like the sound of my latest suggestion?
