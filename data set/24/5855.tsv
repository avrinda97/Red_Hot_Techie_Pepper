2006-07-05T14:02:00.000Z	JDStone		any idea why when I do 'make menuconfig' over ssh, the menuconfig looks all messed up?
2006-07-05T14:04:00.000Z	JDStone		why would make menuconfig look all distorted when I do it over ssh?

2006-07-05T14:08:00.000Z	dli	JDStone	printenv|grep TERM
2006-07-05T14:08:00.000Z	JDStone	dli	TERM=ansi
2006-07-05T14:09:00.000Z	dli	JDStone	exit from ssh shell, export TERM=xterm , try again
2006-07-05T14:10:00.000Z	JDStone	dli	yep, that looks better, thanks
2006-07-05T14:49:00.000Z	dli	JDStone	yes
2006-07-05T14:49:00.000Z	JDStone	dli	then why don't I have the startx command?
2006-07-05T14:50:00.000Z	JDStone	dli	should I have the 'startx' command?
2006-07-05T14:52:00.000Z	dli	JDStone	startx is within the xinit package, use apt-file or packages.ubuntu.com to search packages for content files
2006-07-05T14:54:00.000Z	dli	JDStone	however, you should install a meta package like,  ubuntu-desktop , instead of xserver-xorg (which is pulled in by ubuntu-desktop)
2006-07-05T14:54:00.000Z	JDStone	dli	why is that?
2006-07-05T14:55:00.000Z	dli	JDStone	because xserver-xorg doesn't give you all required X components
2006-07-05T14:55:00.000Z	JDStone	dli	I'm installing mythtv and I don't want something like gnome
2006-07-05T14:56:00.000Z	dli	JDStone	I got a n00b way, install xubuntu-desktop
2006-07-05T14:58:00.000Z	dli	JDStone	okay, x-window-system-core
2006-07-05T14:59:00.000Z	dli	JDStone	you should install debian though, for your specific requirement
2006-07-05T15:00:00.000Z	JDStone	dli	why install debian?
2006-07-05T15:00:00.000Z	dli	JDStone	because the default ubuntu installation is already gnome, while in debian, it's not
2006-07-26T15:41:00.000Z	dli	JDStone	then, use debian :) use whatever works
2006-07-26T15:42:00.000Z	dli	JDStone	you can get it from apt-get.org
2006-07-26T15:43:00.000Z	dli	JDStone	at least, you can download the ubuntu package source, build it on debian
