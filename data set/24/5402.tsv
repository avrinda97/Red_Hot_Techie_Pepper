2009-02-16T03:07:00.000Z	Dolo		I have some problem with mozilla i have to force quit it to make it shutdown
2009-02-16T03:07:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Dolo	how often do you get that?
2009-02-16T03:08:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Dolo	ok how much RAM?
2009-02-16T03:08:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Dolo	ok maybe you got a bad profile
2009-02-16T03:09:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Dolo	,but I have had my own problems with  Ubuntu's unoffical  Firefox version
2009-02-16T03:09:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Dolo	yes there's some Ubuntu changes
2009-02-16T03:09:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Dolo	it's not an offical Mozilla Linux Firefox
2009-02-16T03:11:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Dolo	you tried to install a offical Linux MOzilla Firefox?
2009-02-16T03:11:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Dolo	from Mozilla
2009-02-16T03:12:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Dolo	ok well  other good browsers for Ubuntu to :d
2009-02-16T03:12:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Dolo	I would normalley say to people to use Firefox or Opera, so  they  gain  more market share :d
2009-02-16T03:12:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Dolo	,but if you got problems
2009-02-16T03:13:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Dolo	well yeah there's Opera, that's  closed source though
2009-02-16T03:13:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Dolo	quite a nice browser though
2009-02-16T03:13:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Dolo	,but  Konqueror is my browser of choice after FIrefox
2009-02-16T03:14:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Dolo	 then there's  Epiphany and Galeon which are nice to,  and use the Gecko rendering engine so display the pages the same as FIrefox,  where as Konq uses KTHML
2009-02-16T03:14:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Dolo	sudo apt-get install  epiphany-browser  if you did just  epiphany you would get some game.   sudo apt-get install galeon  also  :d
2009-02-16T03:14:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Dolo	sudo apt-get install konqueror
2009-02-16T03:14:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Dolo	konqueror is  a KDE app
2009-02-16T03:15:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Dolo	I think the Firefox issues in Ubuntu, most of them, are an Ubuntu issue
2009-02-16T03:15:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Dolo	I got a feeling that FIrefox works better in other distros,  but  they use a more offical or an offical version also
2009-02-16T03:15:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Dolo	 Ubuntu and KUbuntu well
2009-02-16T03:16:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Dolo	you can have both installed.  then run KDE and Gnome apps
2009-02-16T03:16:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Dolo	Kubuntu/KDE apps run in Ubuntu/Gnome.   just like    Ubuntu/Gnome apps run in Kubuntu/KDE
