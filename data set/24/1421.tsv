2011-05-18T08:39:00.000Z	ubuntu_		How do I get a brightness applet in ubuntu 11.04
2011-05-18T08:39:00.000Z	ubuntu_		lmao I love how they took out the "Add to panel..." option :s
2011-05-18T08:40:00.000Z	ubuntu_		now my laptop screen  is stuck at full brightness and can't add applet to lower it
2011-05-18T08:40:00.000Z	magn3ts	ubuntu_	they switched from gnome-panel to their own thing that allows the use of indicator applets rather than gnome-panel applets.
2011-05-18T08:40:00.000Z	magn3ts	ubuntu_	sadly I'm not sure what the best way to resolve it is.
2011-05-18T08:40:00.000Z	ubuntu_	magn3ts	their own thing doesn't let you add any different applets
2011-05-18T08:41:00.000Z	magn3ts	ubuntu_	I know. I hate those stupid applets though. But I understand why you need it. I'll look for you.
2011-05-18T08:42:00.000Z	magn3ts	ubuntu_	... you can just revert to classic GNOME... there's no need to run to a new DE.
2011-05-18T08:42:00.000Z	ubuntu_	magn3ts	I kind of want to because they're removing classic GNOME in 11.10 lol
2011-05-18T08:42:00.000Z	magn3ts	ubuntu_	it's not ideal since you have to go to CLI to change it, but short term: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=10795424
2011-05-18T08:42:00.000Z	magn3ts	ubuntu_	they're just upgrading to GNOME 3. I'm not sure if GNOME 2 will be available from repos though...
2011-05-18T08:45:00.000Z	ubuntu_	magn3ts	bash: /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness: Permission denied
2011-05-18T08:45:00.000Z	magn3ts	ubuntu_	sudo?
2011-05-18T08:45:00.000Z	ubuntu_	magn3ts	sudo still returned permission denied :s
2011-05-18T08:46:00.000Z	magn3ts	ubuntu_	do `sudo -s` first, then type the command, then `exit` at the end to get out of root.
2011-05-18T08:46:00.000Z	ubuntu_	magn3ts	that worked :)
2011-05-18T08:47:00.000Z	magn3ts	ubuntu_	great :)
2011-05-18T08:47:00.000Z	ubuntu_	magn3ts	pretty insecure to have to open a root session to change screen brightness though lol...
2011-05-18T08:48:00.000Z	magn3ts	ubuntu_	eh, if you're only executing one command, it doesn't matter. you could also do `sudo bash -c "<command>"` but they're effectively the same thing.
2011-05-18T08:51:00.000Z	ubuntu_	magn3ts	you must be joking, if I was to install ubuntu/unity on laptops for people I oversee I could never add them to the sudoers file just to change screen brightness
2011-05-18T08:51:00.000Z	magn3ts	ubuntu_	oh, sorry, I misunderstood what you meant.
2011-05-18T08:51:00.000Z	magn3ts	ubuntu_	:) of course that's not practical.
2011-05-18T08:52:00.000Z	magn3ts	ubuntu_	not sure what else to tell you for now though. try google, port the brightness applet to an app indicaotr?
2011-05-18T08:53:00.000Z	ubuntu_	magn3ts	yeah, I was just trying it out live :3 Natty is quite beta, going to wait for Oneiric and see if customization is possible in it...thanks for the help :)
