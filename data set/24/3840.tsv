2011-03-24T05:07:00.000Z	linxeh	bazhang	sorry, I've had people bashing linux all day at me at work - yet we have microsoft consultants trying to figure out why all the workstaitons lose printer mappings, but then prevent users from remapping those printers (but they can map different ones fine). Oh, and the fact that profiles get wiped out on average once a fortnight. but they all say microsoft rock. I probably shouldnt use the internet when I'm so fed up of shills and trolls at
2011-12-31T05:05:00.000Z	linxeh	bazhang	good point :)
