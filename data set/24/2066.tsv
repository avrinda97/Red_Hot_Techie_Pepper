2009-05-26T16:26:00.000Z	cycrosism		Could someone tell me how to log in as root on ubuntu server?
2009-05-26T16:27:00.000Z	cycrosism		event not found jrib
2009-05-26T16:27:00.000Z	jrib	cycrosism	please read what ubottu said
2009-05-26T16:29:00.000Z	jrib	cycrosism	don't do what RichiH has suggested as it is unecessary
2009-05-26T16:29:00.000Z	jrib	cycrosism	ifconfig gives you your ip
2009-05-26T16:33:00.000Z	cycrosism	jrib	my account on the server is already root so i just use sudo now
2009-06-12T15:52:00.000Z	jrib	cycrosism	add him to the "admin" group
2009-06-12T15:52:00.000Z	jrib	cycrosism	writing files where?
2009-06-12T15:54:00.000Z	jrib	cycrosism	do you know about sudo?
2009-06-12T15:56:00.000Z	jrib	cycrosism	so what are you running exactly?
2009-06-12T15:57:00.000Z	cycrosism	jrib	I am trying to make my second monitor work, as for some reason it's configuration is set to "Disabled" when i try to save my Configuration file, it won't let me write
2009-06-12T15:57:00.000Z	jrib	cycrosism	again, where are you doing this exactly?
2009-06-12T15:58:00.000Z	cycrosism	jrib	System>Preferences>Display
2009-06-12T15:59:00.000Z	jrib	cycrosism	so you are never prompted for your password?
2009-06-12T16:03:00.000Z	jrib	cycrosism	it's probably a bug.  I've never used that feature so I don't know.  Setting a root password isn't necessary or recommonded and won't fix the issue.  You could try running that app with sudo.  Find out its name then run gksudo name_of_app
2009-06-12T16:04:00.000Z	cycrosism	jrib	how do i find out what the app is called?
2009-06-12T16:04:00.000Z	jrib	cycrosism	right click on the ubuntu icon -> edit menu
2009-06-12T16:07:00.000Z	cycrosism	jrib	the name of the app is just display
2009-06-12T16:07:00.000Z	jrib	cycrosism	I meant the command for it
2009-06-12T16:08:00.000Z	cycrosism	jrib	i did gksudo display
2009-06-12T16:08:00.000Z	jrib	cycrosism	I mean, it's probably not display
2009-06-12T16:08:00.000Z	cycrosism	jrib	gnome-display-properties
2009-06-12T16:08:00.000Z	jrib	cycrosism	gnome-display-properties, yes
2009-06-12T16:11:00.000Z	cycrosism	jrib	Thank you for your help. Much appreciated
