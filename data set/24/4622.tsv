2007-02-25T13:01:00.000Z	burepe	joebob777as7	you are new to ubuntu? All packages (programs) come from repositories where programs are collected. If you set them up you can get nearly every program from them.
2007-02-25T13:02:00.000Z	burepe	joebob777as7	follow the directions on the next url I post
2007-02-25T13:02:00.000Z	joebob777as7	burepe	i'm new i've been using suse for a  little while with smart...
2007-02-25T13:04:00.000Z	joebob777as7	burepe	do I want source repositories?
2007-02-25T13:05:00.000Z	joebob777as7	burepe	what are source repositories?

2007-02-25T13:06:00.000Z	joebob777as7	burepe	i understand that but on that page there is a box that says: Tick this box to include source repositories (If unsure, then you don't want this.)
2007-02-25T13:06:00.000Z	burepe	joebob777as7	in windows you download programs. In ubutu most programs are opensource so they are collected in servers (repositories) all over the world. We get nearly all our programs with that
2007-02-25T13:07:00.000Z	burepe	joebob777as7	you are unsure right? then you don't want it like it says
2007-02-25T13:10:00.000Z	joebob777as7	burepe	still not found... is it easy to compile from source? how do I make sure I have all the right programs to compile? in suse when I use smart it automatically installs all dependent packages to compile...
2007-02-25T13:12:00.000Z	burepe	joebob777as7	how is that program different from gimp? what do you mean not found? what are you looking in? I am just asking because you didn' know what a repository was and I want to make sure you are looking in the right place
2007-02-25T13:12:00.000Z	burepe	joebob777as7	did you add the out put of source-o-matic to your sources.list file?
2007-02-25T13:13:00.000Z	joebob777as7	burepe	i type sudo apt-get update after adding sources.list file then i type sudo apt-get install gimpshop
2007-02-25T13:13:00.000Z	joebob777as7	burepe	gimpshop is for us windows photoshop people it makes all options very similar
2007-02-25T13:14:00.000Z	burepe	joebob777as7	 it might have a differnt package name. use synaptic and search for it
2007-02-25T13:34:00.000Z	burepe	joebob777as7	read all the way to the bottom before you attempt anything http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=67525
