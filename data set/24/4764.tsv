2007-03-20T11:16:00.000Z	hendrixski		hey
2007-03-20T11:16:00.000Z	hendrixski		has anyone here had problems with slow FTP downloads?
2007-03-20T11:17:00.000Z	hendrixski		my FTP is running really slow, and I wonder if it isn't a port related problem
2007-03-20T11:18:00.000Z	hendrixski		download
2007-03-20T11:18:00.000Z	hendrixski		I haven't tried upload yet
2007-03-20T11:19:00.000Z	hendrixski		I'm using filezilla to get a ton of stuff off a friends computer, and it's only going 25 kbs
2007-03-20T11:19:00.000Z	Pici	hendrixski	Locally or over the internet?
2007-03-20T11:20:00.000Z	hendrixski	Pici	 over the internet... he lives a few streets down from me and set up an FTP server on his windows machine
2007-03-20T11:21:00.000Z	Pici	hendrixski	That speed sounds about right.  Remember, his ISP is limiting his upload speed to about 25kbps.
2007-03-20T11:22:00.000Z	Pici	hendrixski	Usually they arent.  You could check with your ISP if you think your upload speed is stoo slow.
2007-03-20T11:24:00.000Z	hendrixski	Pici	 and is 256 kbs a regular bittorrent speed? or can I make that faster by adding more ports somehow?
2007-03-20T11:24:00.000Z	Pici	hendrixski	I don't know, sorry.
2007-03-20T11:24:00.000Z	hendrixski	Pici	 ok  thanks :-)
2007-10-19T21:27:00.000Z	hendrixski	Pici	it's a live DVD?  no more live CD?
2008-01-21T23:02:00.000Z	Pici	hendrixski	I dont believe so, but you could always look and install from `apt-cache depends packagename`
2008-01-21T23:02:00.000Z	hendrixski	Pici	yeah, but I gotta script this
2009-03-24T20:16:00.000Z	hendrixski	Pici	but the sites-enabled/whatever file is the right one to edit?  right?
2009-03-24T20:20:00.000Z	Pici	hendrixski	ikonia: You don't *need* a separate file for each site, but it can be useful.
2009-03-24T20:25:00.000Z	Pici	hendrixski	or symlink, whichever you feel more comfortable doing.
2009-03-24T20:26:00.000Z	Pici	hendrixski	squidly: a2ensite seems to be an available command.
2009-09-02T23:15:00.000Z	hendrixski	Pici	ah, so the update-rc.d command is what controls the runlevels?
2009-09-02T23:15:00.000Z	Pici	hendrixski	Well its not runlevels, but they do control what starts when you boot
2009-09-02T23:16:00.000Z	hendrixski	Pici	right, see I don't even know the difference.  So i just apt-get install like normal and then run update-rc.d remove
2009-09-02T23:16:00.000Z	Pici	hendrixski	Yep
