2006-01-12T15:04:00.000Z	kameron	Berg	you install a bootloader, and it gives you the option to boot to either windows or linux, no performance loss at all
2006-01-12T15:05:00.000Z	kameron	Berg	you can, but you can also set a default, so that it auto boots to one choice after a certain amount of time has passed (say three seconds, or whatever you decide)
2006-01-12T15:05:00.000Z	kameron	Berg	they probably won't be. i can show you how to install linux so that they will never ever notice though.
2006-01-12T15:06:00.000Z	kameron	Berg	okay. that's how i did it when i was 15.
2006-01-12T15:06:00.000Z	kameron	Berg	oh, okay.
2006-01-12T15:07:00.000Z	kameron	Berg	what i did when i installed on my parents comp years ago, i set the timeout to 10ms and had it auto boot to windows, so i had to frantically press the up or down errors so it wouldn't time out of the menu, before i could even see it!
2006-01-12T15:14:00.000Z	kameron	Berg	it depends on how much performance you want. i'm not big into gaming or video editing, etc.. but i do play a few games, and i like cripst graphics.. i run a 6600gt, reasonable performance for the price.
2006-01-12T15:14:00.000Z	kameron	Berg	any card you're interested in, google "benchmarks ___graphics-card-name-here___" to see how it performs compared to other cards.
2006-01-12T15:15:00.000Z	kameron	Berg	what card do you have/
2006-01-12T16:36:00.000Z	kameron	Berg	yes
2006-01-12T16:40:00.000Z	kameron	Berg	fdisk is a part of DOS, you can wipe our partitions and do all sorts of things with it, if you boot to it on a floppy or cdrom. or you can use partition magic, a product from Symantec i think, and run it from windows.
2006-01-12T16:41:00.000Z	kameron	Berg	yes, i can guide you
2006-01-12T16:42:00.000Z	kameron	Berg	messages are disabled from unidentified users on FreeNode, i did not recieve it
