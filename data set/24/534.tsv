2011-07-10T13:48:00.000Z	brainwave92		how do i know if its supported? and if not....how do i go about learning what it takes to even write a driver for it. I know some c++.
2011-07-10T13:49:00.000Z	brainwave92		like......firewire is supported
2011-07-10T13:49:00.000Z	brainwave92		and so should be the sony cam right?
2011-07-10T13:49:00.000Z	brainwave92		https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Firewire
2011-07-10T13:50:00.000Z	brainwave92		here they tell about the messages in var/log/kern.log
2011-07-10T13:50:00.000Z	brainwave92		i was just saying is that i have no such messages on connecting the cam
2011-07-10T13:52:00.000Z	brainwave92		they are repeating the same phrases like- no we cannot guarantee that. Yes it would be wise to try out other cables. Get the camera repaired. And their most irritating......the OS setting might interfere
2011-07-10T13:52:00.000Z	brainwave92		None really telling what the problem is.
2011-07-10T13:53:00.000Z	brainwave92		How come?
2011-07-10T13:53:00.000Z	brainwave92		Look when other sony cams like HC 36, HC 46 and all are supported....why not HC 40!
2011-07-10T13:53:00.000Z	pozic	brainwave92	it is real simple: you ask whether they support it, if they don't you get a different camera.
2011-07-10T13:54:00.000Z	pozic	brainwave92	you ask to whoever wants to sell you one.
2011-07-10T13:54:00.000Z	pozic	brainwave92	or if you already have it, you just try it.
2011-07-10T13:54:00.000Z	pozic	brainwave92	and if it doesn't work, you learned a lesson.
2011-07-10T13:56:00.000Z	pozic	brainwave92	the reason it is hard to write a driver is not because writing a driver is hard (for most devices at least), it is because it is secret what you have to send to the device to get a certain response.
2011-07-10T13:56:00.000Z	brainwave92	pozic	i understand
2011-07-10T13:57:00.000Z	pozic	brainwave92	another reason to buy increasingly more open hardware.
2011-07-10T13:59:00.000Z	pozic	brainwave92	the problem is that you have to explain to Linux how to get those images.
2011-07-10T14:04:00.000Z	pozic	brainwave92	you only have greater control, if you know what you are doing.
2011-07-10T14:04:00.000Z	brainwave92	pozic	thats why i need help
2011-07-10T14:10:00.000Z	pozic	brainwave92	go to whoever sold you the device and let him show you how to get it working on Windows.
2011-07-10T14:10:00.000Z	pozic	brainwave92	then there is a base line and you can try it on Linux.
2011-07-10T14:10:00.000Z	pozic	brainwave92	simple.
2011-07-10T14:11:00.000Z	brainwave92	pozic	thanks. i'll do that
