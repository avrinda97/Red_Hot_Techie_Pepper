2008-01-06T23:01:00.000Z	Xintruder		im downloading updates at 19kbs, is this the average speed :/ ?
2008-01-06T23:03:00.000Z	Xintruder		ok thanks
2008-01-06T23:03:00.000Z	Xintruder		oh ok
2008-01-06T23:04:00.000Z	Xintruder		guys i need help, I have a white box, with no title or icons, in the center of my screen, which is annoying and i can't remove. How can I remove/fix this?
2008-01-06T23:05:00.000Z	n6hgg	Xintruder	you could find the process causing it using "top" perhaps, and then use the Kill command in top
2008-01-06T23:06:00.000Z	Xintruder		top ???
2008-01-06T23:06:00.000Z	n6hgg	Xintruder	it'll take a little trial and error to find it probably
2008-01-06T23:09:00.000Z	n6hgg	Xintruder	learn the "top" command using a terminal.  type "top", then when the program is up, type "u" and then your user name for processes under your user name, then use the "k" (kill) command and type the number of the process you think it might be.  Either that or perhaps there's a kill function in the menu somewhere for that white window.
2008-01-06T23:09:00.000Z	n6hgg	Xintruder	does the white window come up every time it boots?
2008-01-06T23:10:00.000Z	Xintruder		well when I rebooted, it came up after i selected update manager
2008-01-06T23:10:00.000Z	n6hgg	Xintruder	i see..hmmm   do you think update-manager is hung up or something?
2008-01-06T23:11:00.000Z	Xintruder	n6hgg	it does not appear at startup right away
2008-01-06T23:11:00.000Z	Xintruder	n6hgg	not sure man ><
2008-01-06T23:11:00.000Z	Xintruder	n6hgg	also, when that happens i see characters in the background
2008-01-06T23:11:00.000Z	Xintruder		big characters
2008-01-06T23:12:00.000Z	n6hgg	Xintruder	well, I guess do a little digging with top and other system monitors, and maybe you can find out what program is causing it and then kill it and then disable it somehow.  Other than that I'm clueless
2008-01-06T23:13:00.000Z	n6hgg	Xintruder	good luck
2008-01-06T23:13:00.000Z	Xintruder	n6hgg	this problem started appearing right after i installed th plugin-fix for flash and stuff
2008-01-06T23:13:00.000Z	Xintruder	n6hgg	thanks -_-
2008-01-06T23:14:00.000Z	n6hgg	Xintruder	i see, I'll think about that.  It could be a flash malfunction eh?
2008-01-06T23:14:00.000Z	Xintruder	n6hgg	u wont believe this, when i disabled visuall effects, all is ok now
2008-01-06T23:14:00.000Z	Xintruder		wierd
2008-01-06T23:15:00.000Z	Xintruder		its definitly something related to compiz...
2008-01-06T23:15:00.000Z	n6hgg	Xintruder	excellent, well you are on your way to finding out what it is hopefully.  I usually find stuff like that only by stumbling along and finding things by accident.
