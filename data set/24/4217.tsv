2007-06-09T15:39:00.000Z	ubuntuish	SlimeyPete	did you read?
2007-06-09T15:40:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	ubuntuish	so what exactly is the problem? is it giving an error message?
2007-06-09T15:40:00.000Z	ubuntuish	SlimeyPete	just won't let write to the hdd's says i don't have access
2007-06-09T15:41:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	ubuntuish	do you have access to the directory into which it is mounted? (usually /media/sda1 or similar)
2007-06-09T15:41:00.000Z	ubuntuish	SlimeyPete	i have read access already, just won't let me write
2007-06-09T15:42:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	ubuntuish	and I presume that you have unmounted & remounted the drive (or just rebooted)?
2007-06-09T15:42:00.000Z	ubuntuish	SlimeyPete	yes i've rebooted
2007-06-09T15:42:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	ubuntuish	I know. Do you have write access to the directory into which it is mounted?
2007-06-09T15:42:00.000Z	ubuntuish		media you mean?
2007-06-09T15:42:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	ubuntuish	yeah... well, /media/sda1 or whatever
2007-06-09T15:43:00.000Z	ubuntuish	SlimeyPete	thing is i started thunar using sudo
2007-06-09T15:43:00.000Z	ubuntuish		still says i have only read access
2007-06-09T15:43:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	ubuntuish	ah. How odd. Is the filesystem error-free? Just a thought.
2007-06-09T15:43:00.000Z	ubuntuish	SlimeyPete	perfect no issues what so ever
2007-06-09T15:44:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	ubuntuish	hmm, not sure then, sorry
2007-06-09T15:44:00.000Z	ubuntuish		kthnx
2007-06-09T15:44:00.000Z	ubuntuish	SlimeyPete	another thing would you know why i can't access files from a windows pc?
2007-06-09T15:45:00.000Z	ubuntuish	SlimeyPete	i have samba and i've assigned folders via share as well
2007-06-09T15:45:00.000Z	ubuntuish	SlimeyPete	it shows me the pc when i search for it via ip but it doesn't let me login irrespective of the username and password i use
2007-06-09T15:46:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	ubuntuish	you have to add users to samba. There's a graphical way of doing it I think but I use smbpasswd from the command line.
2007-06-09T15:46:00.000Z	ubuntuish	SlimeyPete	kthnx i'll check it out
