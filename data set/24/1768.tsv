2011-12-25T05:57:00.000Z	aBound		HA! I like Unity but I know lightdm has it's issues and some other things. I haven't tried gnome-shell out yet.
2011-12-25T05:57:00.000Z	aBound		I suppose people dislike Unity due to the lack of customization?
2011-12-25T05:58:00.000Z	aBound		Gnome 2 was developed for a long time.
2011-12-25T06:00:00.000Z	aBound		None of the BS from 11.10 Buntu?
2011-12-25T06:00:00.000Z	aBound		lol
2011-12-25T06:00:00.000Z	aBound		Hmm, might have to give that a run in vbox too.
2011-12-25T06:00:00.000Z	aBound		I just dislike the gui in mint.
2011-12-25T06:02:00.000Z	aBound		I think 8GB or 12GB would be best.
2011-12-25T06:02:00.000Z	aBound		I overdid it.
2011-12-25T06:02:00.000Z	aBound		I might just have to run FreeBSD. :P
2011-12-25T06:03:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	aBound	With only a Gig of RAM and a Mickey Mouse, Pent4, single processor, 10.04 is as stable as all get out. :-)
2011-12-25T06:03:00.000Z	aBound	Sidewinder1	that's incredible.
2011-12-25T06:04:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	aBound	With over 4 TB., of storage; I'm happy as a clam!
2011-12-25T06:06:00.000Z	aBound	Sidewinder1	My specs: Nvidia GeForce GTX 560M Graphics with 1.5GB GDDR5 Video Memory, 2nd Generation Intel Core i7-2670QM Processor ( 6MB L3 Cache, 2.20GHz ), 16 GB Dual Channel DDR3 SDRAM at 1333MHz - 4 X 4GB, 80 GB Intel 320 Series SATA II 3 Gb/s Solid State Disk Drive, Intel Centrino Ultimate-N 6300 - 802.11A/B/G/N Wireless LAN Module
2011-12-25T06:06:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	aBound	You've just gotta' find which version works best for you. No one said it would be a "piece of cake", but, given enough research, I'm certain you'll find "the key!"
2011-12-25T06:07:00.000Z	aBound	Sidewinder1	No doubt it's a windwhirl. :P
2011-12-25T06:07:00.000Z	aBound	Sidewinder1	I just need one stable enough to use so I don't have to worry about the ins and outs.
2011-12-25T06:07:00.000Z	aBound	Sidewinder1	But as a bunch of you implied saying 10.04 was far more stable.
2011-12-25T06:10:00.000Z	aBound	Sidewinder1	It's like most of the time I have to worry about the issues and I wanna start learning coding here and there. Blah!
2011-12-25T06:11:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	aBound	I learned, a long time ago, "bleeding edge", ain't worth my time; cutting edge, while kewl, still, ain't.. Especially when I can save mucho $, and buy tech. that is 9 mos., old and everything works, 'out-of -the- box'.. :D
2011-12-25T06:11:00.000Z	aBound	Sidewinder1	I feel you on that but when those goodies are there it gets on the new users like me. Even though my box is four days old.
2011-12-25T06:14:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	aBound	I prefer Synaptic..
2011-12-25T06:14:00.000Z	aBound	Sidewinder1	brightspark: Looks like we all prefer our own little way of grabbing pkgs.
2011-12-25T06:16:00.000Z	aBound	Sidewinder1	Ever since I used the terminal I fell in love with Linux.
