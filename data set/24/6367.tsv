2006-05-17T06:11:00.000Z	samuli		kane666, use aptitude instead of apt-get
2006-05-17T06:11:00.000Z	samuli		that way you can remove it as easily.
2006-05-17T06:11:00.000Z	samuli		haha :)
2006-05-17T06:12:00.000Z	samuli		kane, try sudo aptitude install kde-core then perhaps.
2006-05-17T06:13:00.000Z	samuli		kubuntu-desktop is something like 150-200mb worth of packages and kde-core is something like 40mb
2006-05-17T06:14:00.000Z	samuli		e17 is buggy like hell.
2006-05-17T06:15:00.000Z	linux_galore	samuli	been running e17 in Vector Linux now for 6 months
2006-05-17T06:15:00.000Z	linux_galore	samuli	its been very stable for the last 9 weeks
2006-05-17T06:15:00.000Z	samuli	linux_galore	I have tried it from time to time with daily cvs-builds, and most of it still doesn't work.-
2006-05-18T08:35:00.000Z	linux_galore	samuli	yes there is its called swat
2006-05-18T08:35:00.000Z	linux_galore	samuli	its even on the samba home page
2006-05-18T08:35:00.000Z	linux_galore	samuli	swat has 90% of the stuff you need
2006-05-18T09:01:00.000Z	linux_galore	samuli	happens, sometimes better to do a fresh install, thats why I always make a /home  partition so i can flush an install and do a fresh update but lose none of my users stuff
2006-05-19T13:25:00.000Z	samuli	linux_galore	too bad dapper's install doesn't let one to choose /home partition.
2006-05-19T13:26:00.000Z	linux_galore	samuli	actually it does
2006-05-19T13:26:00.000Z	samuli	linux_galore	not the dapper graphical installer anyways.
2006-05-19T13:26:00.000Z	linux_galore	samuli	yep
2006-05-19T13:27:00.000Z	linux_galore	samuli	if you lazy like me get a  Mandriva Live CD and use diskdrake to setup your partitions
2006-05-19T13:28:00.000Z	linux_galore	samuli	then install ubuntu
2006-05-19T13:28:00.000Z	samuli	linux_galore	my partitions are fine now. I'm just saying dapper's installer didn't have that option for me.
2006-05-19T13:28:00.000Z	linux_galore	samuli	its there in the advanced setup
2006-05-19T13:28:00.000Z	samuli	linux_galore	that's what I used.
2006-05-19T13:37:00.000Z	samuli	linux_galore	like living on the edge huh? :)
2006-05-19T13:37:00.000Z	linux_galore	samuli	actually i installed e17 last year under Vector Linux
