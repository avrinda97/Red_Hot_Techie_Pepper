2011-02-03T08:41:00.000Z	Deemux	craigbass1976	i am on a live cd right now how do i see the logs?
2011-02-03T08:44:00.000Z	craigbass1976	Deemux	mount up the / of your installed ubuntu (I usually just put it in /mnt)  so sudo mount -t ext3 /dev/sda1 /mnt
2011-02-03T08:45:00.000Z	craigbass1976	Deemux	so long as /dev/sda1 is your root partition.  Then the logs would be in /mnt/var/log/
2011-02-03T08:49:00.000Z	Deemux	craigbass1976	i got: mount: /dev/sda2 already mounted or /mnt busy
2011-02-03T08:50:00.000Z	craigbass1976	Deemux	just type mount and what are the last couple of entries?
2011-02-03T08:52:00.000Z	Deemux	craigbass1976	binfmt_misc on /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc type binfmt..... and gvfs-fuse-daemon on /home/ubuntu/.gvfs type fuse.gvfs-fuse....
2011-02-03T08:53:00.000Z	craigbass1976	Deemux	no /dev/sda2 anywhere?
2011-02-03T08:55:00.000Z	Deemux	craigbass1976	nop /dev/sda2 is not there
2011-02-03T08:57:00.000Z	Deemux	craigbass1976	do u think there is a way i can access my files from the live cd?
2011-02-03T08:57:00.000Z	craigbass1976	Deemux	hrmmmm  But it's busy when you try to mount it....  Yes, I totally think you can get at them from the livecd
2011-02-03T08:58:00.000Z	craigbass1976	Deemux	did you try mounting sda1?
2011-02-03T08:59:00.000Z	Deemux	craigbass1976	sda1 gives me mount:wrong fs type, bad option ...
2011-02-03T09:01:00.000Z	craigbass1976	Deemux	sudo fdisk /dev/sda  When you get to Command (m for help):  type a lowercase p and hit enter.
2011-02-03T09:02:00.000Z	craigbass1976	Deemux	oh, forget it.  If you're already there, hit q to quit.
