2006-06-08T07:15:00.000Z	gharz	Frogzoo	thanks! i'll check the website.
2006-06-10T09:07:00.000Z	Frogzoo	gharz	define "doesn't play" - what happens?
2006-06-10T09:08:00.000Z	Frogzoo	gharz	1st off, have you install libdvdcss2 ?
2006-06-10T09:08:00.000Z	gharz	Frogzoo	Warbo : Totem could not play 'vcd:///media/cdrom0'. There is no input plugin to handle the location of this movie.
2006-06-10T09:09:00.000Z	Frogzoo	gharz	you need to change totem's path to /dev/dvd   (from the looks of things, I'm guessing mind)
2006-06-10T09:09:00.000Z	gharz	Frogzoo	ok... let me check the path.
2006-06-10T09:10:00.000Z	gharz	Frogzoo	from fstab right?
2006-06-10T09:10:00.000Z	Frogzoo	gharz	no - within totem
2006-06-10T09:10:00.000Z	gharz	Frogzoo	ok... let me check on that.
2006-06-10T09:12:00.000Z	Frogzoo	gharz	doesn't seem to be an option to change it...
2006-06-10T09:12:00.000Z	gharz	Frogzoo	somebody just gave me an idea and it might have helped.
2006-06-10T09:12:00.000Z	gharz	Frogzoo	but it didn't.
2006-06-10T09:23:00.000Z	gharz	Frogzoo	Warbo : i still can't play DVD/VCD. when i open it from nautilus... since the file is .dat, under the type column, it says 'plain text document'... does it matter?
2006-06-10T09:26:00.000Z	Frogzoo	gharz	consider gxine? i don't use totem, so can't help with that
2006-06-10T10:37:00.000Z	gharz	Frogzoo	this is regarding playing my vcd/dvd again. i checked the syslog and i got these message => http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/15474 does it have do with it?
2006-06-10T10:39:00.000Z	Frogzoo	gharz	don't know what's going on there
