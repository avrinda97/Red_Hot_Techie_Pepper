2011-01-15T04:17:00.000Z	sandyd	intrader	bad things will happen if you mix the ubuntu + debian repos
2011-01-15T04:12:00.000Z	sandyd	intrader	don't mix debian + ubuntu
2011-01-15T04:17:00.000Z	sandyd	intrader	its based off debian. but its NOT debian
2011-01-15T04:28:00.000Z	sandyd	intrader	you cant. that was the issue I was arguing about earlier. You have to compile it manually
2011-01-15T04:30:00.000Z	intrader	sandyd	nit-wit,zooka, I am pointed to http://packages.ubuntu.com/source/hardy/gkrellm-i8k by zooka and nit-wit. I guess compiling is the solution. I have not attempted to do this on ubuntu.
2011-01-15T04:31:00.000Z	sandyd	intrader	yup. compiling is the way to go.
2011-01-15T04:34:00.000Z	intrader	sandyd	nit-wit, zooka, scary proposition - I will look it up
2011-01-15T04:34:00.000Z	sandyd	intrader	its not as scary as it sounds.... im typing from a system thats compile completely from source...
2011-01-15T04:36:00.000Z	intrader	sandyd	what precautions should I take for compiling and adding that to the system?
2011-01-15T04:37:00.000Z	sandyd	intrader	since you don't have the actual program in the repos, theirs not much you need to worry about
2011-01-15T04:40:00.000Z	intrader	sandyd	aha  - I was pointed by zooka to http://packages.ubuntu.com/source/hardy/gkrellm-i8k.  What is is source there? I don't see the source, only binaries
2011-01-15T04:46:00.000Z	sandyd	intrader	sorry for delay, was on phone http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/g/gkrellm-i8k/gkrellm-i8k_2.5.orig.tar.gz
2011-01-15T04:50:00.000Z	intrader	sandyd	what I find missing in synaptic is 'gkrellm-i8k' (part of 'sudo apt-get install i8kutils gkrellm gkrellm-i8k') - so on that repository, when I download gkelilm-i9k...tar.gz I find i8krellm.c as the only .c source.
2011-01-15T04:51:00.000Z	intrader	sandyd	sorry - that is gkrellm-i8k...tar.gz
2011-01-15T04:52:00.000Z	sandyd	intrader	it should be a gz file
2011-01-15T04:55:00.000Z	intrader	sandyd	where should I download the .gz file in order to work on it and compile?
2011-01-15T04:59:00.000Z	intrader	sandyd	nit-wit, zooka, I need to be away for a bit - thanks for the help so far.
2011-01-15T04:59:00.000Z	sandyd	intrader	http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/g/gkrellm-i8k/gkrellm-i8k_2.5.orig.tar.gz
2011-01-15T05:00:00.000Z	intrader	sandyd	into which folder should I download the .gz file?
2011-01-15T05:00:00.000Z	sandyd	intrader	anywhere
2011-01-15T05:01:00.000Z	intrader	sandyd	nit-wit, zooka, I need to be away for a bit - thanks for the help so far; I will continue later.
2011-01-15T05:54:00.000Z	intrader	sandyd	in http://www.tuxfiles.org/linuxhelp/softinstall.html it says to execute ./configure. After extracting I don't see ./configure
2011-01-15T05:57:00.000Z	intrader	sandyd	that is trying to compile gkrellm-i8k_2.5.orig.tar.gz
2011-01-15T06:05:00.000Z	intrader	sandyd	are you still here?
