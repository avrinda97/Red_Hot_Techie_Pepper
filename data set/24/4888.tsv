2006-12-21T06:12:00.000Z	Jerry|M		Is there any way to get more support for other graphics cards..? Besides ATI/nVidia (for GL)
2006-12-21T06:12:00.000Z	RasQulec	Jerry|M	The intel integrated cards mostly have opensource drivers
2006-12-21T06:16:00.000Z	RasQulec	Jerry|M	http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Edgy#How_to_install_Graphics_Driver_.28Intel.29  try looking at that
2006-12-21T06:17:00.000Z	RasQulec	Jerry|M	in your xorg.conf file do you have it set to load glx in the moduels section?
2006-12-21T06:19:00.000Z	Jerry|M	RasQulec	Will this give me support for GLX?
2006-12-21T06:20:00.000Z	RasQulec	Jerry|M	hm I am not sure
2006-12-21T06:20:00.000Z	Jerry|M	RasQulec	Ok.. I'll go try it anyways
2006-12-21T06:20:00.000Z	RasQulec	Jerry|M	have you run glxgears
2006-12-21T06:20:00.000Z	Jerry|M	RasQulec	It tells me my device doesn't have GLX extensions
2006-12-21T06:22:00.000Z	RasQulec	Jerry|M	actually look at what kitche said first
2006-12-21T06:36:00.000Z	RasQulec	Jerry|M	I think aiglx requires glx to b e working
2006-12-21T06:37:00.000Z	RasQulec	Jerry|M	the integrated is not a fast gaming solution
2006-12-21T06:40:00.000Z	RasQulec	Jerry|M	you should try the link I gave you earlier now
2006-12-21T06:43:00.000Z	Jerry|M	RasQulec	alien: command not found
2006-12-21T06:52:00.000Z	Jerry|M	RasQulec	Does this thing install a certain driver to use? or does it use the same i810..
2006-12-21T06:52:00.000Z	RasQulec	Jerry|M	:/ I am not sure
2006-12-21T06:52:00.000Z	Jerry|M	RasQulec	Know of a way to enumerate all of the available graphics drivers?
2006-12-21T06:53:00.000Z	RasQulec	Jerry|M	sorry I dont ):
2006-12-21T07:06:00.000Z	Jerry|M	RasQulec	Know what this error means and how to fix it? (http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/38181/)
2006-12-21T07:08:00.000Z	RasQulec	Jerry|M	did you say you were recompiling your kernel?
2006-12-21T07:08:00.000Z	Jerry|M	RasQulec	Trying to follow the instructions here (http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Edgy#How_to_install_Graphics_Driver_.28Intel.29)
2006-12-21T07:10:00.000Z	RasQulec	Jerry|M	hm try looking up which module loads the agp stuff
2006-12-21T07:24:00.000Z	Jerry|M	RasQulec	Do you know of what to do after you follow the steps for the intel driver install? It really doesn't appear to be doing anything.. at all...
2006-12-21T07:27:00.000Z	RasQulec	Jerry|M	not really you could try restarting xorg
