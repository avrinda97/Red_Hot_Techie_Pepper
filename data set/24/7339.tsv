2005-08-06T05:38:00.000Z	grogoreo		hi
2005-08-06T05:38:00.000Z	grogoreo		can you run jack and also at the same time?
2005-08-06T05:38:00.000Z	grogoreo		&alsa
2005-08-06T05:39:00.000Z	grogoreo		*alsa
2005-08-06T05:39:00.000Z	ryanpg	grogoreo	jack and alsa are different things... jack uses alsa as a backend
2005-08-06T05:40:00.000Z	ryanpg	grogoreo	jackd is not a replacement for esd
2005-08-06T05:42:00.000Z	ryanpg	grogoreo	yes and you should not try this
2005-08-06T05:43:00.000Z	grogoreo	ryanpg	but if i were to have a separete install for this, it will be ok
2005-08-06T05:44:00.000Z	ryanpg	grogoreo	you can install jackd and have esd too no problem
2005-08-06T05:44:00.000Z	ryanpg	grogoreo	but you have to stop esd to use jackd
2005-08-06T05:44:00.000Z	grogoreo	ryanpg	right so i could just have another user and when that user logs on esd could stop and jackd start
2005-08-06T05:45:00.000Z	ryanpg	grogoreo	you probably want to use qjackctl to start jackd
2005-08-06T05:46:00.000Z	ryanpg	grogoreo	jackd should not be "always on"
2005-08-06T05:46:00.000Z	grogoreo	ryanpg	qjackctl the GUI frontend? will this stop esd for me?
2005-08-06T05:47:00.000Z	ryanpg	grogoreo	you can tell it to stop esd... it provides a "execute script on startup" option that could stop esd
2005-08-06T05:48:00.000Z	grogoreo	ryanpg	great thanks for your hlep
2005-08-06T05:48:00.000Z	ryanpg	grogoreo	no problem
2005-08-06T05:48:00.000Z	ryanpg	grogoreo	just don't try to run jackd all the time ok?  it will make you unhappy :P
2005-08-06T05:49:00.000Z	grogoreo	ryanpg	im about to use APT now to get jack. I'm presuming it will automatically start it all the time so where can I tell it not to?
2005-08-06T05:50:00.000Z	ryanpg	grogoreo	no it will not start it
2005-08-06T05:50:00.000Z	ryanpg	grogoreo	you have to use the command line or qjackctl
2005-08-06T05:51:00.000Z	grogoreo	ryanpg	ok thanks again. I've just found out that i've allready had it installed so theres so problems anyway
2005-08-06T05:52:00.000Z	ryanpg	grogoreo	you could pop over to #lad for more jackd specific help btw
2005-08-06T05:53:00.000Z	grogoreo	ryanpg	thanks again. I'm off now
