2004-12-06T07:32:00.000Z	sleon		ok
2004-12-06T07:32:00.000Z	sleon		BUT
2004-12-06T07:32:00.000Z	sleon		my vid card in notebook works only with Xor
2004-12-06T07:32:00.000Z	sleon		g
2004-12-06T07:32:00.000Z	sleon		:(
2004-12-06T07:33:00.000Z	sladen	sleon	warty (stable) is XF4 + 320,000 lines of patches.  hoary (development) is Xorg
2004-12-06T07:33:00.000Z	sladen	sleon	the Xvesa driver should work
2006-10-19T13:28:00.000Z	sladen	sleon	most of them out of the box.  It's not the card that matters, but the chipset and there are only 4-5.
2006-10-19T13:28:00.000Z	sleon	sladen	where can i get the list of chipsets then?
2006-10-19T13:29:00.000Z	sladen	sleon	eg. Orinoco, ipw2100/2200/3945, atmel, broadcom  cover 99.97% of the market and they all work out of the box
2006-10-19T13:29:00.000Z	sleon	sladen	and intel/centrino drivers? do they also work with wpa?
2006-10-19T13:29:00.000Z	sleon	sladen	there are lots of netgear cards for example which are not working, right?
2006-10-19T13:29:00.000Z	sladen	sleon	the ipw ones should work with WPA, yes
2006-10-19T13:30:00.000Z	sleon	sladen	thx
2006-10-19T13:30:00.000Z	sladen	sleon	the netgear cards are probably something else inside, can you find out what the actual chipset is?
2006-10-19T13:30:00.000Z	sleon	sladen	it is had
2006-10-19T13:31:00.000Z	sleon	sladen	and the problem is: same models have different chipsets :(
2006-10-19T13:31:00.000Z	sleon	sladen	and manufacturers do not tell which chipsets they are using
2006-10-19T13:31:00.000Z	sleon	sladen	for example rev 1.0 of a  card has completely different chipset then rev2.0
2006-10-19T13:31:00.000Z	sladen	sleon	indeed.  If you find a card that doesn't work, that's a bug---and one that needs fixing, if you have such an example of card, please file a bug
2006-10-19T13:32:00.000Z	sladen	sleon	even better, there's a orinoco copy out there, except this one requires firmware loading first *and* the PCI IDs are the same
2006-10-19T13:32:00.000Z	sleon	sladen	maybe there is a sort of a page about linux hardware with such list?
2006-10-19T13:33:00.000Z	sladen	sleon	if it's a laptop, we have the https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LaptopTestingTeam
2006-10-19T13:33:00.000Z	sleon	sladen	thx
