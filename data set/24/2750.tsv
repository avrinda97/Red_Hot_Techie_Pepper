2010-02-08T18:15:00.000Z	aprilhare		hello. i'm trying to run alien arena (the version from getdeb) and i get the following error: "AL lib: oss.c:179: Could not open /dev/dsp: Device or resource busy" - anyone have any ideas how to get past that?
2010-02-08T18:17:00.000Z	erUSUL	aprilhare	launch it like this « padsp alienarena »
2010-02-08T18:18:00.000Z	aprilhare	erUSUL	that made a difference - but it's still not running. get the same errors as before except the one i quoted earlier isn't there. "bt_audio_service_open: connect() failed: Connection refused (111)"

2010-04-24T16:28:00.000Z	erUSUL	aprilhare	if number is a single digit or two you can use ? or ?? instead of the broader *
2010-04-24T16:28:00.000Z	aprilhare	erUSUL	that didn't work
2010-04-24T16:28:00.000Z	erUSUL	aprilhare	make a test with a copy of some files so you are sure it does the right thing
2010-04-24T16:29:00.000Z	aprilhare	erUSUL	even
2010-04-24T16:29:00.000Z	erUSUL	aprilhare	it worked here
2010-04-24T16:31:00.000Z	erUSUL	aprilhare	mkdir tmp/ && touch  tmp/donkey{0..99}.old && ls tmp/* && prename 's/\.old/\.new/'  donkey*.old && ls tmp/*
2010-04-24T16:32:00.000Z	aprilhare	erUSUL	thanks but it's done - why the /tmp/ stuff anyways?
2010-04-24T16:33:00.000Z	erUSUL	aprilhare	it was just a test to show you that it really works
2010-04-24T16:33:00.000Z	erUSUL	aprilhare	i created a folder tmp/ full of files named lioke yoursa and renamed them
2010-04-24T16:33:00.000Z	erUSUL	aprilhare	100 files to be exact
2010-04-24T16:34:00.000Z	aprilhare	erUSUL	a little bit excessive? :)

2010-06-29T16:21:00.000Z	aprilhare	erUSUL	i could compile from source... :)
2010-06-29T16:21:00.000Z	erUSUL	aprilhare	finding a deb. (even third party) is allways a prefered option.
