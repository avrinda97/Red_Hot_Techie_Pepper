2005-06-22T11:10:00.000Z	bob2	GMAN2003	vsftp
2005-06-22T11:21:00.000Z	bob2	GMAN2003	"appz" is not a word, btw ;)
2005-06-22T11:21:00.000Z	bob2	GMAN2003	edit /etc/apt/sources.list and comment out (add a # to the beginning of the line) that mentions the cd
2005-06-22T11:27:00.000Z	bob2	GMAN2003	if you want
2005-06-22T11:28:00.000Z	bob2	GMAN2003	what error?
2005-06-22T11:29:00.000Z	bob2	GMAN2003	so, run 'sudo apt-get update'
2005-06-22T11:29:00.000Z	bob2	GMAN2003	paste your /etc/apt/sources.list to #flood
2005-06-22T11:30:00.000Z	bob2	GMAN2003	no, please do what I said
2005-06-22T11:31:00.000Z	bob2	GMAN2003	no, it's a file you need to show us
2005-06-22T11:35:00.000Z	GMAN2003	bob2	lemme know when u c it
2005-06-22T11:35:00.000Z	bob2	GMAN2003	so, you didn't actually comment out the cd rom line
2005-06-22T11:35:00.000Z	bob2	GMAN2003	go do that, and it'll stop trying to access it
2005-06-22T11:36:00.000Z	bob2	GMAN2003	as above
2005-06-22T11:40:00.000Z	GMAN2003	bob2	keeps telling me access denied
2005-06-22T11:41:00.000Z	bob2	GMAN2003	when you say things like that, you need to tell us *what* is saying "access denied"
2005-06-22T11:42:00.000Z	bob2	GMAN2003	so, some text editor is giving you that error?
2005-06-22T11:42:00.000Z	bob2	GMAN2003	run "sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list" in a terminal
2005-06-22T11:42:00.000Z	GMAN2003	bob2	i tried using a couple of editors to comment out the cd line, and all keep saying Access Denied
2005-06-22T11:43:00.000Z	bob2	GMAN2003	yes, of course, you need root permissions to edit files in /etc/
2005-06-22T11:43:00.000Z	bob2	GMAN2003	run the command I gave you
2005-06-22T11:44:00.000Z	bob2	GMAN2003	then save and exit
2005-06-22T11:47:00.000Z	GMAN2003	bob2	frickin sweet dude, thx for the tip, F3 to save
2005-06-22T11:48:00.000Z	GMAN2003	bob2	if u ever need any halo tips, gimme a call
