2005-11-15T06:48:00.000Z	LathropWells	J_Element	- it's worth a try. - i used to confuse xmms all the time by adding conflicting codecs.
2005-11-19T07:15:00.000Z	LathropWells	J_Element	- give ubotu's link a peek winmac_fstab - will find and mount all available partitions automatically.
2005-11-19T07:15:00.000Z	J_Element	LathropWells	 ?
2005-11-19T07:16:00.000Z	LathropWells	J_Element	- winmac_fstab.sh is a very nice script that will find and enable all parttions auto matically.
2005-11-19T07:18:00.000Z	J_Element	LathropWells	 where do i get it ?
2005-11-19T07:24:00.000Z	J_Element	LathropWells	 i got the script how do i use it ?

2005-11-19T07:36:00.000Z	LathropWells	J_Element	- once the file is mad executable you can use it by clicking on it. - Ubuntu puts shortcuts for all of your drives and partitions on the desktop.
2005-11-19T07:37:00.000Z	LathropWells	J_Element	- likely better to stay in channel more people more ideas for a solution.
2005-11-19T07:38:00.000Z	LathropWells	J_Element	- hm - well, you can take a peek at what is on the disk the old fashioned way. please use fdisk with care   "sudo fdisk -l" that is l=list
2005-11-19T07:42:00.000Z	LathropWells	J_Element	sudo mount -t VFAT -o ro /dev/hda1 /media/hda1   - peek at the winmac file it will have a few examples
