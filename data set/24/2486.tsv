2009-09-01T10:29:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Rishab_	are you able to access the filesystem and view the files?

2009-09-01T10:35:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Rishab_	there's no line in fstab for your partition?
2009-09-01T10:36:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Rishab_	i can tell you a line to add if you tell me the device and mountpoint
2009-09-01T10:36:00.000Z	Rishab_	prince_jammys	but the device mount and accessible

2009-09-01T10:38:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Rishab_	are you the only user?
2009-09-01T10:38:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Rishab_	the mount point is the directory where you go to access the files.
2009-09-01T10:40:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Rishab_	echo $UID   (should give you 1000 in a typical install)
2009-09-01T10:45:00.000Z	Rishab_	prince_jammys	echo $UID gives "0"  as output
2009-09-01T10:45:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Rishab_	tsk tsk.
2009-09-01T10:46:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Rishab_	well your normal user has UID 1000 by default.
2009-09-01T10:47:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Rishab_	you do have a regular user, right?
2009-09-01T10:48:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Rishab_	an administrative user who ISN'T root
