2012-04-29T01:08:00.000Z	pzn		I'm upgrading from 11.10 to 12.04. graphical screen was "lost"... I can't switch windows anymore, I can't see "taskbar", I can't press alt+f4 to close current window and see upgrade manager that is below it. what to do?
2012-04-29T01:09:00.000Z	sfears	pzn	alt+tab does anything happen?
2012-04-29T01:10:00.000Z	pzn	sfears	no, alt-tab does not work... keyboard seems to be "up", because capslock led works
2012-04-29T01:11:00.000Z	pzn	sfears	now I can see "gedit" that was opened. it got maximized, it does not have icons to close, minimize, maximize. ctrl-alt-f1 and crtl-alt-f7 works
2012-04-29T01:11:00.000Z	pzn	sfears	yes, I can run.
2012-04-29T01:13:00.000Z	pzn	sfears	I'm killing every app that I don't need
2012-04-29T01:14:00.000Z	pzn	sfears	yes, menus are gone, and also icons to minimize,max,close are gone.
2012-04-29T01:14:00.000Z	pzn	sfears	now I can see the updatemanager app...
2012-04-29T01:14:00.000Z	sfears	pzn	turn off desktop effects, you may have a window manager conflict
2012-04-29T01:15:00.000Z	pzn	sfears	how to do it? alt-f2 did not work. I had to use ctrl+alt+f1 tty1 to kill gedit
2012-04-29T01:16:00.000Z	pzn	sfears	I mean, how to turn off effects from tty1?
2012-04-29T01:17:00.000Z	pzn	sfears	can I reboot in the middle of 11.10->12.04 upgrade? is this safe?
2012-04-29T01:28:00.000Z	sfears	pzn	maybe resolution is set too high?
2012-04-29T01:29:00.000Z	pzn	sfears	it is 1024x768 (default for my 14 inch monitor)
2012-04-29T01:30:00.000Z	sfears	pzn	what happens if you reboot?
2012-04-29T01:32:00.000Z	pzn	sfears	is it worth to reboot in the middle of the upgrade? If I can't fix it now, maybe better wait the 2 hours for the end of upgrade, then reboot, isn't?
2012-04-29T01:34:00.000Z	sfears	pzn	don't reboot in the middle.  Is the upgrade finished?
2012-04-29T01:34:00.000Z	pzn	sfears	about 2 hours to finish.
2012-04-29T01:35:00.000Z	pzn	sfears	well... I'm at work now. I'll take the notebook to home turned on. when it finishes I'll reboot. lets pray for the best :-)
2012-04-29T01:36:00.000Z	pzn	sfears	Jordan_U, thanks for your help!
2012-04-29T01:37:00.000Z	pzn	sfears	ok. that is a good advice. I was just using gedit to program... but since I had other computer at work I could be using the other one...
2012-04-29T01:38:00.000Z	sfears	pzn	make sure it gets a clean restart.  "sudo restart" is you can't get to the shutdown button
2012-04-29T01:41:00.000Z	pzn	sfears	ok, I'll take care to do to clean reboot from tty1 after it finishes the upgrade process.
2012-04-29T01:42:00.000Z	pzn	sfears	thanks again for your help. will go home now. bye
