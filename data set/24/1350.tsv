2010-04-02T04:52:00.000Z	BlowAway		No it doesn't it returns that error.
2010-04-02T04:52:00.000Z	BlowAway		I installed ufw now. How do I forward everything form eth2 to eth0 and back?
2010-04-02T04:54:00.000Z	BlowAway		However i never get to set it up correctly without displaying the error.
2010-04-02T04:54:00.000Z	RfooTfoo	BlowAway	what is the error your getting?
2010-04-02T04:56:00.000Z	RfooTfoo	BlowAway	did you look at the config file to see what it is set to currently?
2010-04-02T04:57:00.000Z	RfooTfoo	BlowAway	usually /etc/firestarter/
2010-04-02T05:00:00.000Z	RfooTfoo	BlowAway	paste bin the config file
2010-04-02T05:03:00.000Z	RfooTfoo	BlowAway	you have to use paste bin to paste into. then post the url in here
2010-04-02T05:08:00.000Z	RfooTfoo	BlowAway	how many network cards do you have?
2010-04-02T05:10:00.000Z	RfooTfoo	BlowAway	i dont understand. what is the primary role of this box your installing firestarter on? are you using it as a gateway in your network?
2010-04-02T05:14:00.000Z	RfooTfoo	BlowAway	if you run ifconfig which interface is the modem?
2010-04-02T05:18:00.000Z	RfooTfoo	BlowAway	you need to change the config file where it says (external network interface) to ppp0
2010-04-02T05:19:00.000Z	RfooTfoo	BlowAway	the external interface is your modem, the internal interface I would think is eth2
2010-04-02T05:22:00.000Z	RfooTfoo	BlowAway	its possible. that was an assuption i said I THINK hehe
2010-04-02T05:22:00.000Z	RfooTfoo	BlowAway	I was looking at the packets recv/sent
2010-04-02T05:25:00.000Z	RfooTfoo	BlowAway	use vi gedit is for girls. lol
2010-04-02T05:28:00.000Z	RfooTfoo	BlowAway	how are you editting the file are you root?
2010-04-02T05:34:00.000Z	RfooTfoo	BlowAway	you have to navigate before you hit esc i
2010-04-02T05:35:00.000Z	RfooTfoo	BlowAway	after you hit esc i and edit. to navigate just hit esc again to get out of insert mode
2010-04-02T05:36:00.000Z	RfooTfoo	BlowAway	hit esc :q! to get out of the file with out saving if you messed up.
2010-04-02T05:39:00.000Z	RfooTfoo	BlowAway	esc :x
2010-04-02T05:41:00.000Z	RfooTfoo	BlowAway	i dunno what your in then. if your editing a file in vi esc :x will save the file and exit.
2010-04-02T05:41:00.000Z	RfooTfoo	BlowAway	maybe this will help http://www.lagmonster.org/docs/vi.html
2010-04-02T05:43:00.000Z	RfooTfoo	BlowAway	if your in vi editing a file you have to press esc :x enter. that will save and exit to shell.
