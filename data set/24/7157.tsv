2005-04-17T14:13:00.000Z	EvilIdler	kakalto	Hey, the symbols showed up correctly :)
2005-04-17T14:14:00.000Z	EvilIdler	kakalto	Now go wash your fingers, for I am sure you probably just insulted the non-Asian portion of the channel :P
2005-04-17T14:14:00.000Z	EvilIdler	kakalto	Yeah, but I currenly have no way of knowing that for sure :P
2005-04-17T14:15:00.000Z	EvilIdler	kakalto	I'm picking up some verbal Cantonese and Greek. Feck knows if I'll ever learn to read any of either, though :P
2005-04-17T14:17:00.000Z	EvilIdler	kakalto	While getting through all the Zatoichi movies, I've discovered I've picked up an awful lot of Japanese, actually. Not that I can form a sentence, or anything.
2005-04-17T14:53:00.000Z	EvilIdler	kakalto	Ehh..just like we do? Is there even an X in the 'alphabet'?
2005-04-17T14:54:00.000Z	EvilIdler	kakalto	I'd expect them to spell it "linuksu"
2005-04-19T11:12:00.000Z	EvilIdler	kakalto	Frames?! Are you surfing with a timemachine?
2005-04-19T11:12:00.000Z	EvilIdler	kakalto	Try links
2005-04-19T11:12:00.000Z	EvilIdler	kakalto	Get links-ssl, even
2005-04-19T11:43:00.000Z	EvilIdler	kakalto	ctrl-g for help
2005-04-19T11:44:00.000Z	EvilIdler	kakalto	meta-A to mark beginning of selection
2005-04-19T11:45:00.000Z	EvilIdler	kakalto	gpm is the mouse program, I think
2005-04-19T14:02:00.000Z	EvilIdler	kakalto	It'll always boot on x86 hardware no matter where it was installed, unless something went very wrong
2005-04-19T14:02:00.000Z	kakalto	EvilIdler	what about graphics?
2005-04-19T14:03:00.000Z	EvilIdler	kakalto	I said 'boot', not 'launch X' ;)
2005-04-19T14:03:00.000Z	kakalto	EvilIdler	my bad.
2005-04-19T14:03:00.000Z	EvilIdler	kakalto	If the kernel and init loads, it has successfully booted. Anything beyond that is pure luxury :P
2005-04-19T14:03:00.000Z	kakalto	EvilIdler	:P
2005-04-19T14:09:00.000Z	EvilIdler	kakalto	What would they do with the other 400 megs of space, then?
2005-04-19T14:09:00.000Z	kakalto	EvilIdler	perhaps more packages?
2005-04-19T14:09:00.000Z	EvilIdler	kakalto	Yeah..they could almost fit Eclipse 3 on that..
