2011-08-26T17:25:00.000Z	experiMental_	glebihan	i'll relogin now
2011-08-26T17:30:00.000Z	experiMental_	glebihan	current autostart file: www.pasteall.org/24314 gives no autostart after login
2011-08-26T17:31:00.000Z	glebihan	experiMental_	ok then could you pastebin the python script itself
2011-08-26T17:34:00.000Z	experiMental_	glebihan	www.pasteall.org/24315
2011-08-26T17:35:00.000Z	glebihan	experiMental_	you should replace the value of the "plik" variable by the absolute path to "1.txt"
2011-08-26T17:36:00.000Z	experiMental_	glebihan	what line?
2011-08-26T17:36:00.000Z	glebihan	experiMental_	line 43 : plik='1.txt'
2011-08-26T17:39:00.000Z	experiMental_	glebihan	i'm not shure i understand the meaning of "absolute value" - double quote instead of single quote, is it this?
2011-08-26T17:40:00.000Z	glebihan	experiMental_	no I mean that instead of '1.txt' it should be '/path/to/1.txt' (I guess /home/user/Desktop/1.txt)
2011-08-26T17:41:00.000Z	experiMental_	glebihan	can this be "./1.txt" instead of "1.txt"?
2011-08-26T17:41:00.000Z	glebihan	experiMental_	no it would be the same as what it is now
2011-08-26T17:42:00.000Z	experiMental_	glebihan	is there any universal solution for different folders?
2011-08-26T17:43:00.000Z	glebihan	experiMental_	is the "1.txt" file always in the same folder as the python script ?
2011-08-26T17:43:00.000Z	experiMental_	glebihan	yes
2011-08-26T17:44:00.000Z	glebihan	experiMental_	ok then use "plik=os.path.join(os.path.split(__file__)[0], '1.txt')"
2011-08-26T17:44:00.000Z	glebihan	experiMental_	you'll have to add "import os" at the beginning of the file
2011-08-26T17:44:00.000Z	experiMental_	glebihan	ok, ill try :)
2011-08-26T17:45:00.000Z	glebihan	experiMental_	let me know how it goes

2011-08-26T17:51:00.000Z	glebihan	experiMental_	no why ?
