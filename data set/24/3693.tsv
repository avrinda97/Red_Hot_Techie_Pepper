2008-04-08T20:45:00.000Z	nottobi		hello, .. after installing windows i tried to reinstall grub, with root (hd0,1) and setup (hd0) .. worked fine. i can boot back to linux, but now my ntfs partition is broken?
2008-04-08T20:46:00.000Z	dtolj	nottobi	try editing menu.lst and chainload to windows partition
2008-04-08T20:47:00.000Z	nottobi	dtolj	yes, i adjusted my menu.lst, but i can't even mount the ntfs partition any more. it seems to be broken. was there not enough space for grub in the mbr?
2008-04-08T20:48:00.000Z	dtolj	nottobi	no thats not it grub should find its place in MBR, but you can boot into ntfs?
2008-04-08T20:49:00.000Z	nottobi	dtolj	no, neither boot nor mount it: "unexpected clusters per mft record (-1), fauled to mount .. etc."
2008-04-08T20:50:00.000Z	nottobi	dtolj	i thought if installing grub wouldn't have killed the ntfs-partition i should be able to mount it?
2008-04-08T20:51:00.000Z	dtolj	nottobi	I dont see how grub could have damaged it, try repairing the partition from linux then, you dont need to mount it, use fdisk /dev/(ntfs)
2008-04-08T20:52:00.000Z	nottobi	dtolj	i am just wondering how that could be possible. it's a relatively new lenovo-laptop, and i already had problems with sata, but it's running in compatibility mode now..
2008-04-08T20:57:00.000Z	dtolj	nottobi	how does fdisk read that ntfs partition?
2008-04-08T20:58:00.000Z	nottobi	dtolj	it says System unknown, and for all partitions it says Partition X does not end on cylinder boundaries.
2008-04-08T21:00:00.000Z	dtolj	nottobi	do you not get a message saying press w to correct partition table or similar
2008-04-08T21:01:00.000Z	dtolj	nottobi	I would recommend downloading http://www.ultimatebootcd.com/ to fix grub/hard disk related issues
2008-04-08T21:01:00.000Z	nottobi	dtolj	no, it even says THis doesn't look like a partition table, probably you selected the wrong device
2008-04-08T21:02:00.000Z	dtolj	nottobi	what does it say in cat /etc/mtab
2008-04-08T21:03:00.000Z	dtolj	nottobi	that command should have installed grub in the MBR
2008-04-08T21:04:00.000Z	nottobi	dtolj	ok thats the /etc/mtab from the xubuntu cd, there is /dev/sda2 listed as ext3
2008-04-08T21:04:00.000Z	nottobi	dtolj	no ntfs, gparted is also not able to mount it
2008-04-08T21:04:00.000Z	dtolj	nottobi	just that?
2008-04-08T21:05:00.000Z	nottobi	dtolj	no, 10other lines - but nothing else of sda. what do you want to know?
2008-04-08T21:07:00.000Z	dtolj	nottobi	well if its corrupt somehow, you have to use special tools to fix it, what message do you get when you try to mount /dev/sda1
2008-04-08T21:10:00.000Z	nottobi	dtolj	"unexpected clusters per mft record (-1), fauled to mount .." genii answered on that message that google finds windows recovery and fixmbr as answer
2008-04-08T21:10:00.000Z	nottobi	dtolj	i am wondering what i should change if i can fix it, by fixmbr or reinstall, what will happen the next time i install grub
2008-04-08T21:14:00.000Z	dtolj	nottobi	try fixmbr if that dosnt work its safe to reinstall grub
2008-04-08T21:15:00.000Z	nottobi	dtolj	ok, i will try. i have to leave the irc. thanks a lot and cu
