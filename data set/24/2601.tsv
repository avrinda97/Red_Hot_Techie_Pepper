2008-10-30T13:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kinnaz	they always take a decent app and stick win on the start

2009-09-24T16:14:00.000Z	kinnaz	ActionParsnip	via firefox ?
2009-09-24T16:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kinnaz	no, via synaptic, uninstall it then reistall it
2009-09-24T16:14:00.000Z	kinnaz	ActionParsnip	i dont think i instaleld it via synaptic in the first place but lets give it a try
2009-09-24T16:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kinnaz	if you use 64bit you can use the 64bit beta plugin, works groovy here
2009-09-24T16:16:00.000Z	kinnaz	ActionParsnip	package name?
2009-09-24T16:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kinnaz	there isnt one, download the tar.gz and put the .so file in ~/.mozilla/plugins    : http://download.macromedia.com/pub/labs/flashplayer10/libflashplayer-10.0.32.18.linux-x86_64.so.tar.gz  it will only work if your Ubuntu is 64bit. It WILL NOT WORK if you are using 32bit.
2009-09-24T16:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kinnaz	you will also need to remove the flash plugins you currently have installed
2009-09-24T16:18:00.000Z	kinnaz	ActionParsnip	yep im on x64, imported my home dir from 32 so thats why i prolly have 32 version instaleld, tnx for help
2009-09-24T16:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kinnaz	the plugins folder will need creating
2009-09-24T16:21:00.000Z	kinnaz	ActionParsnip	so i should see Shockwave Flash 10.0 r32 under plugins from firefox ?
2009-09-24T16:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kinnaz	i guess
2009-09-24T16:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kinnaz	i always just hit a flash page like: http://www.rathergood.com/blode2
2009-09-24T16:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kinnaz	you'll need to make sure firefox is not running before you rerun it
2009-09-24T16:24:00.000Z	kinnaz	ActionParsnip	that was it, didnot correctly restart firefox, now its working :) tnx for hel
2009-09-24T16:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kinnaz	easiest way imho, stupid package never worked for me
2009-09-24T16:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kinnaz	i do the same for java, 64bit java.bin file stick it in /opt and symlink, java be good
