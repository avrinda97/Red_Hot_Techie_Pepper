2004-12-11T14:38:00.000Z	wig	cef_work	you here?
2004-12-11T14:46:00.000Z	wig	cef_work	hey, does gcc come installed on ubuntu?
2004-12-11T14:46:00.000Z	cef_work	wig	not installed by default.. afaik, it's on the cd
2004-12-11T14:46:00.000Z	wig	cef_work	how do i install that sucker?
2004-12-11T14:47:00.000Z	wig	cef_work	damn
2004-12-11T14:47:00.000Z	cef_work	wig	tell me about it. I'm sick of downloading stuff all the time
2004-12-11T14:51:00.000Z	cef_work	wig	'apt-cdrom' afaik
2004-12-11T14:52:00.000Z	wig	cef_work	then i just pick what i want?
2004-12-11T14:52:00.000Z	cef_work	wig	then you should just be able to use synaptic or apt-get
2004-12-11T14:53:00.000Z	wig	cef_work	what's apt-get? ive never used before.
2004-12-11T14:54:00.000Z	wig	cef_work	also, when i put the kernel sources in the /usr/src place, the "make" file on the modem patch says ".config" can't be found
2004-12-11T14:54:00.000Z	cef_work	wig	cos you haven't built them yet
2004-12-11T14:55:00.000Z	wig	cef_work	built what? o_O
2004-12-11T14:55:00.000Z	cef_work	wig	the kernel.. using gcc
2004-12-11T14:55:00.000Z	wig	cef_work	i gotta BUILD the kernel too?
2004-12-11T14:55:00.000Z	cef_work	wig	well you're building the driver, right?
2004-12-11T14:55:00.000Z	wig	cef_work	it's from a tar.g i downloaded
2004-12-11T14:56:00.000Z	cef_work	wig	actually you only need to copy the config into the right place.. it's just that the drive 'expects' that you've just build a kernel
2004-12-11T14:56:00.000Z	wig	cef_work	how do i do that?
2004-12-11T14:57:00.000Z	cef_work	wig	cd into the kernel source, then 'cp /boot/config-<tab> .config'
2004-12-11T14:57:00.000Z	cef_work	wig	the config depends on what kernel you're running at the time
2004-12-11T14:58:00.000Z	cef_work	wig	nah it's called 'stupid winmodem' syndrome
2004-12-11T14:58:00.000Z	cef_work	wig	what brand winmodem?
2004-12-11T14:58:00.000Z	wig	cef_work	lucent/agere
