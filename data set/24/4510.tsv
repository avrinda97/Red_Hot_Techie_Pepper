2007-03-24T08:24:00.000Z	atoponce	Ahorner	you need to use sudo
2007-03-24T08:25:00.000Z	atoponce	Ahorner	sudo ln -s /home/andy/....
2007-03-24T08:26:00.000Z	atoponce	Ahorner	whenever you get a permission denied, that means that the permissions belong to another user, and you don't have permission to do what you want
2007-03-24T08:26:00.000Z	atoponce	Ahorner	chances are, it's owned by root, so you'll need to use 'sudo' in front of your command
2007-03-24T08:27:00.000Z	atoponce	Ahorner	root is disabled by default in ubuntu
2007-03-24T08:28:00.000Z	atoponce	Ahorner	what's up?
