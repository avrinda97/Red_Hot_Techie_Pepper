2008-08-03T20:08:00.000Z	td123	capri	I will just assume, you meant your driver isn't loaded and you're network adapter isn't working because of that :), in that case, do lspci, and google your wireless card. First step in becoming a hacker is to not rely on anyone else :)... that's your first lesson...
2008-08-03T20:09:00.000Z	capri	td123	i am already connected with it
2008-08-03T20:09:00.000Z	td123	capri	...

2008-08-03T20:10:00.000Z	td123	capri	please google firmware and then read what it actually means before using it.
