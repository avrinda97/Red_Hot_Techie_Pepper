2007-01-15T08:29:00.000Z	taal1		hello
2007-01-15T08:29:00.000Z	taal1		could anybody tell me what is better for dualcore - draper or edgy ?
2007-01-15T08:31:00.000Z	taal1		noone knows ?:)
2007-01-15T08:32:00.000Z	erUSUL	taal1	both support dual-core just fine, edgy has a more recent kernel though
2007-01-15T08:32:00.000Z	taal1	erUSUL	i know that
2007-01-15T08:33:00.000Z	taal1	erUSUL	but should I recompile dreper kernel for dualcore or not ?
2007-01-15T08:34:00.000Z	erUSUL	taal1	no, just use the smp kernel or whatever is called... (i can't remember)
2007-01-15T08:34:00.000Z	taal1	erUSUL	and what about performance, isn't edgy better ?
2007-01-15T08:35:00.000Z	taal1	erUSUL	i know, smp  kernel, draper include it itself or i should download it ?
2007-01-15T08:37:00.000Z	erUSUL	taal1	newer versions of gnome are said to perform better, in the kernel the difference if any will be minimal, use apt to install the kernel
2007-01-15T08:39:00.000Z	taal1	erUSUL	i heard about gnome performance, but i dont need it, my instalation will be server only, i need very good database performance, now i have breezy and my proc is 80-90% used
2007-01-15T08:40:00.000Z	erUSUL	taal1	if tou are so concerned about such issues you may want to compile your own kernel and twek it
2007-01-15T08:40:00.000Z	erUSUL		!kernel | taal1
2007-01-15T08:41:00.000Z	erUSUL	taal1	btw, it it is a server maybe stiking with dapper is a better option due to its LTS (long time support)
2007-01-15T08:41:00.000Z	taal1	erUSUL	yes, but kernel compilation is quite complicated and mistake sensitive :)
2007-01-15T08:41:00.000Z	erUSUL	taal1	if i can make it, i'm sure you can too ;)
2007-01-15T08:42:00.000Z	taal1	erUSUL	of course i can, but i'm not sure if my compilation will be better than comon is :)
2007-01-15T08:44:00.000Z	erUSUL		!ntfs | chable
2007-01-15T08:45:00.000Z	taal1	erUSUL	tell me, do You think the better idea is upgrade 5.1 to 6.06 with standart dist-upgrade or make quite new instalation ?
2007-01-15T08:46:00.000Z	erUSUL	taal1	i have upgraded my instalation since warty with the standar procedure and have had no issues whatsoever...
2007-01-15T08:46:00.000Z	erUSUL	taal1	so i think is up to you...
2007-01-15T08:46:00.000Z	erUSUL		!upgrade
2007-01-15T08:47:00.000Z	taal1		erUSUL:ok, thx for help :)
2007-01-15T08:48:00.000Z	erUSUL	taal1	no problem
