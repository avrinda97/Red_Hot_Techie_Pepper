2011-03-28T21:28:00.000Z	semitones	myk_robinson	a good starting point would be "man mount" -- let us know what command you are about to use and then someone may be able to doublecheck for you
2011-03-28T21:28:00.000Z	myk_robinson	semitones	I actually just hooked it up via a usb adapter and Ubuntu auto-mounted it. but I cannot access some directories due to a permissions error. i cant change ownership or permissions because it is showing to be read only
2011-03-28T21:29:00.000Z	semitones	myk_robinson	you'll need to unmount it, and remount it with a custom command, since the automount magic is read-only by default for that case I guess
2011-03-28T21:30:00.000Z	myk_robinson	semitones	are you able to advise on the command? googling as we speak, and i just instlled some hfstools from synaptic
2011-03-28T21:31:00.000Z	semitones	myk_robinson	the command to use would be the simple "mount" command, I think. To know what options to use, type "man mount" into the terminal
2011-03-28T21:32:00.000Z	semitones	myk_robinson	your system can already mount it, you just have to tell it how to mount it
2011-03-28T21:38:00.000Z	myk_robinson	semitones	i used the mount command and passed the -o rw switch, and still no luck
2011-03-28T21:40:00.000Z	semitones	myk_robinson	what was the whole command you used?
2011-03-28T21:40:00.000Z	myk_robinson	semitones	sudo mount -o rw /dev/sdc2 /home/myk/Desktop/MAC/
2011-03-28T21:41:00.000Z	semitones	myk_robinson	ok, first things first, try to make your mountpoint somewhere in /media, so like /media/MAC -- this way it will show up on your destkop automatically
2011-03-28T21:42:00.000Z	myk_robinson	semitones	done
2011-03-28T21:42:00.000Z	semitones	myk_robinson	also make sure to create the directory with mkdir before you use it as a mountpoint
2011-03-28T21:42:00.000Z	semitones	myk_robinson	something like sudo mkdir /media/MAC
2011-03-28T21:43:00.000Z	myk_robinson	semitones	got the directory created
2011-03-28T21:46:00.000Z	myk_robinson	semitones	I mounted using sudo mount -t hfsplus /dev/sdc2 /media/MAC/  it mounts, but still read only
2011-03-28T21:47:00.000Z	semitones	myk_robinson	shouldn't there be the read-write option in the command somewhere?
2011-03-28T21:47:00.000Z	myk_robinson	semitones	yes, the -o rw portion
2011-03-28T21:47:00.000Z	semitones	myk_robinson	that's not in the command you pasted
2011-03-28T21:47:00.000Z	myk_robinson	semitones	I posted a second command, sorry
2011-03-28T21:50:00.000Z	semitones	myk_robinson	i'm sure someone can help you -- don't give up!
2011-03-28T21:51:00.000Z	myk_robinson	semitones	I am assuming the hard drive is just jacked up at this point. I have doen this several times before without any problem. But I can barely even read the drive in OSX
2011-03-28T21:52:00.000Z	semitones	myk_robinson	yeah that could be the problem -- have you tried using mac's disk repair features from boot?
2011-03-28T21:53:00.000Z	myk_robinson	semitones	unable to repair the volume
2011-03-28T21:53:00.000Z	semitones	myk_robinson	hmm i don't know :( good luck!
