2008-11-19T02:22:00.000Z	KillerOrca		does anyone know how to move an existing install to a larger Harddrive?
2008-11-19T02:23:00.000Z	chubs	KillerOrca	cp
2008-11-19T02:23:00.000Z	chubs	KillerOrca	just plug them both in and either change grub or make sure the new one is in the same position as the old
2008-11-19T02:24:00.000Z	KillerOrca	chubs	well new HD has an old win XP install on it
2008-11-19T02:25:00.000Z	chubs	KillerOrca	so either wipe that install (as it should be ;-) ) or repartition it first
2008-11-19T02:26:00.000Z	KillerOrca	chubs	my system couldn't install with the normal livecd, will it be fine to partition with it?
2008-11-19T02:26:00.000Z	chubs	KillerOrca	why could it not install?
2008-11-19T02:26:00.000Z	KillerOrca	chubs	I got ubuntu to install, but had to use one of the alternate CDs
2008-11-19T02:27:00.000Z	chubs	KillerOrca	and why did you have to do that? low on ram?
2008-11-19T02:27:00.000Z	KillerOrca	chubs	Yeah, like 128 MB ram and a 800 MHz P3 meant alternate install
2008-11-19T02:29:00.000Z	chubs	KillerOrca	ahh. well if the livecd runs you can partition with it no problem, i'm not sure how easy it is to partition with the alternate cd, i would assume you can get to cfdisk but don't have much experience with it. I'd recommend the gparted livecd for partitioning if you have a blank disc to spare
2008-11-19T02:32:00.000Z	KillerOrca	chubs	I have a disc to spare, but can it also format/partition the replacement drive with XP?
2008-11-19T02:32:00.000Z	chubs	KillerOrca	yes, just resize the xp partition first
2008-11-19T02:33:00.000Z	KillerOrca	chubs	No, I want to use the whole disk, I already moved that XP install to a larger HDD
2008-11-19T02:33:00.000Z	chubs	KillerOrca	well then it's even easier, and you can actually partition it right inside of ubuntu if you'd like
2008-11-19T02:35:00.000Z	KillerOrca	chubs	K, will there be some kind of wizard for that?
2008-11-19T02:36:00.000Z	chubs	KillerOrca	the gparted program should be pretty straightforward. i'm not aware of any wizard, just make sure it's not mounted and partition away
2008-11-19T02:37:00.000Z	KillerOrca	chubs	ok, which drive should not be mounted?
2008-11-19T02:38:00.000Z	chubs	KillerOrca	the one you wish to partition
2008-11-19T02:38:00.000Z	KillerOrca	chubs	is there a way to make sure it is not mounted?
2008-11-19T02:39:00.000Z	chubs	KillerOrca	you can type mount in a terminal. the app will also not let you partition if it's mounted
2008-11-19T02:39:00.000Z	KillerOrca	chubs	thanks a lot; also is there a way to get around the restart required by some updates from the package manager?
2008-11-19T02:40:00.000Z	chubs	KillerOrca	no. You don't necessarily have to restart either, but the new packages won't be in use until you do (kernel, x.org drivers, etc.)
2008-11-19T02:41:00.000Z	KillerOrca	chubs	k, guess I'm restarting then, thanks for the help.
