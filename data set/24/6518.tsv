2005-10-01T12:08:00.000Z	bimberi	B_166-ER-X	it shouldn't restart any downloads, just restart where it left off
2005-10-19T06:12:00.000Z	bimberi	B_166-ER-X	you can extract it with tar -xvjf <file>

2005-12-04T11:07:00.000Z	B_166-ER-X	bimberi	the script worked well, although mouting my winHD with a weird name... and i see no sign of how to edit the partitions name :\
2005-12-04T11:11:00.000Z	bimberi	B_166-ER-X	is it in /etc/fstab?
2005-12-04T11:13:00.000Z	bimberi	B_166-ER-X	see if the label is in /etc/fstab

2005-12-04T11:17:00.000Z	bimberi	B_166-ER-X	ok, what name would you like? :)
2005-12-04T11:18:00.000Z	bimberi	B_166-ER-X	ok, first "sudo umount /dev/hda1"
2005-12-04T11:19:00.000Z	bimberi	B_166-ER-X	now "sudo mv /media/*hda1* /media/windows"
2005-12-04T11:20:00.000Z	bimberi	B_166-ER-X	then "sudo gedit /etc/fstab" and change "/media/0\040GB\040Disk\040(hda1)" to "/media/windows" on that line
2005-12-04T11:21:00.000Z	bimberi	B_166-ER-X	(save and exit the editor) now "sudo mount -a"
2005-12-04T11:22:00.000Z	B_166-ER-X	bimberi	, wow :) nice thnx a lot...saved me a few hours of web search :)
2005-12-04T11:22:00.000Z	bimberi	B_166-ER-X	np, hopefully it looks a bit better now :)
2005-12-04T11:56:00.000Z	bimberi	B_166-ER-X	lol
2006-03-01T17:42:00.000Z	bimberi	B_166-ER-X	'sudo fdisk -l' will show you all partitions (including the unmounted ones)
2006-03-06T06:11:00.000Z	bimberi	B_166-ER-X	sound-juicer can, but requires mp3 libraries to be installed.  Either the RestrictedFormats wiki page or the forums can help with that
