2008-02-04T01:24:00.000Z	SleepingSloth		i have a question... i've got a directory with hundreds of files in it-all named differently(obviously), but some contain the same content. can anyone suggest a quick way of identifying the duplicates (something diff-like) ??
2008-02-04T01:25:00.000Z	nemilar	SleepingSloth	diff ;)  are they exact duplicates?  you could then use hashes, aslso
2008-02-04T01:26:00.000Z	SleepingSloth	nemilar	so - shell script along the lines of 'foreach file in directory, diffit against all the other files?
2008-02-04T01:26:00.000Z	nemilar	SleepingSloth	jrib has a good idea about using filesizes to narrow down the candidate field
2008-02-04T01:27:00.000Z	nemilar	SleepingSloth	if they're completely identical, you can make hashes for all of them (will take a little while) and compare
2008-02-04T01:29:00.000Z	nemilar	SleepingSloth	if they're going to be the _exact_ same content, use the filesize
2008-02-06T15:24:00.000Z	nemilar	SleepingSloth	all the darn ops are sleeping or something
2008-02-06T15:25:00.000Z	SleepingSloth	nemilar	 yeah, it's not clever
2008-02-06T15:54:00.000Z	SleepingSloth	nemilar	but they are quite simple
2008-02-06T15:54:00.000Z	nemilar	SleepingSloth	lol, samba and I just don't get along
2008-02-06T15:54:00.000Z	SleepingSloth	nemilar	i dont dance either ;)
2008-02-06T17:59:00.000Z	SleepingSloth	nemilar	at least it didnt cost you $$ though, just time
2008-02-06T17:59:00.000Z	nemilar	SleepingSloth	yeah, that's true... and I think probably some sleep, most likely
2008-02-06T18:01:00.000Z	SleepingSloth	nemilar	have you ever managed to get a dual graphics card xserver? i have a pci nvidia graphics card, and i'm considering adding it to my exiting pcie card so i can add a third monitor. doable?
2008-02-06T18:01:00.000Z	nemilar	SleepingSloth	yeah, I had an ATI Radeon + Onboard Intel setup at one time, worked fine/great
2008-02-06T18:02:00.000Z	nemilar	SleepingSloth	the new autoconfig for Xorg.conf files doesn't support more than two monitors... mine was done back when there was /no/ decent autoconfig, so I had to write my xorg entirely by hand
2008-02-06T18:02:00.000Z	SleepingSloth	nemilar	how about desktop candy?
2008-02-06T18:02:00.000Z	nemilar	SleepingSloth	lol with all that power, I'm sure you'll be fine
2008-02-06T18:02:00.000Z	nemilar	SleepingSloth	I had compiz running for a while, cube on each monitor
2008-02-06T18:02:00.000Z	nemilar	SleepingSloth	now I just use a TV as my second monitor and I only use it when I'm playing something on it
2008-02-06T18:04:00.000Z	SleepingSloth	nemilar	yeah - what i would like to do, is have a dedicated 3d accelerated monitor which is not impeded by candy - so i dont have problems with games. i still have soft crashes sometimes when i maximise games- they just dont handle 2 monitors well, sometimes crashing, sometimes maximising to both, etc etc... and performance is hit by having to draw the other monitor on the same gfx card...
2008-02-06T18:05:00.000Z	nemilar	SleepingSloth	true... I never play games anymore, so i donno about that
2008-02-06T18:06:00.000Z	nemilar	SleepingSloth	I spent about 15 minutes trying to get The Sims running about a week ago, and just gave up
2008-02-06T18:07:00.000Z	SleepingSloth	nemilar	the sims?! i'd rather watch crap accumulating in my keyboard
