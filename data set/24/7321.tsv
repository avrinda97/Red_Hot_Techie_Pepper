2005-02-09T06:46:00.000Z	LinuxNoob		i downloaded the ISO file from the website, but when i tried to burn a bootable CD in Nero and boot my computer it didn't work...
2005-02-09T06:46:00.000Z	ogra	LinuxNoob	did you use the "burn iso" function in nero ?
2005-02-09T06:47:00.000Z	ogra	LinuxNoob	nope
2005-02-09T06:47:00.000Z	ogra	LinuxNoob	at which speed did you burn ?
2005-02-09T06:48:00.000Z	ogra	LinuxNoob	shouldnt be more then 8x, rather 4x
2005-02-09T06:49:00.000Z	ogra	LinuxNoob	its a limitation of bootable CDs
2005-02-09T06:50:00.000Z	ogra	LinuxNoob	if your bios is set to boot from cd it will simply boot
2005-02-09T06:51:00.000Z	ogra	LinuxNoob	normally you have to hit a F key on boot
2005-02-09T06:51:00.000Z	ogra	LinuxNoob	yup
2005-02-09T07:16:00.000Z	LinuxNoob	ogra	you said 8x was the max burn speed of Live CD?
2005-02-09T07:16:00.000Z	ogra	LinuxNoob	yup
2005-02-09T07:16:00.000Z	ogra	LinuxNoob	btter 4x
2005-02-09T07:16:00.000Z	LinuxNoob	ogra	and then that should work if i boot from CD?
2005-02-09T07:17:00.000Z	ogra	LinuxNoob	yep
2005-02-09T07:17:00.000Z	LinuxNoob	ogra	thanks so much
2005-02-09T07:19:00.000Z	LinuxNoob	ogra	if i boot with live CD will i be able to get online right away or will i have to configure my network settings and stuff?
2005-02-09T07:21:00.000Z	ogra	LinuxNoob	it should work right away ...
