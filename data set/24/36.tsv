2012-10-18T12:12:00.000Z	Josh-		Hello
2012-10-18T12:13:00.000Z	Josh-		Why ubuntu 12.04 treats left and right super key different ?
2012-10-18T12:13:00.000Z	actionParsnip	Josh-	because they are different keys
2012-10-18T12:14:00.000Z	Josh-	actionParsnip	How to make one act exactly like other?
2012-10-18T12:16:00.000Z	actionParsnip	Josh-	that's windows based, gimme a sec
2012-10-18T12:18:00.000Z	actionParsnip	Josh-	may help https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/KEYMAP
2012-10-18T12:23:00.000Z	Josh-	actionParsnip	hehe, linking arch's website in ubuntu huh
2012-10-18T12:25:00.000Z	actionParsnip	Josh-	no, natty is not LTS
2012-10-18T12:25:00.000Z	actionParsnip	Josh-	not all releases are LTS
2012-10-18T12:25:00.000Z	actionParsnip	Josh-	8.04, 10.04 and 12.04 are LTS, the intermediate releases are not
2012-10-18T12:29:00.000Z	Josh-	actionParsnip	I had file manager as shortcut for Super+E
2012-10-18T12:30:00.000Z	actionParsnip	Josh-	if you run:  xev      and press both keys, you'll see they make different keycodes
2012-10-18T12:31:00.000Z	Josh-	actionParsnip	So is there anyway for both to perform same task?
2012-10-18T12:32:00.000Z	actionParsnip	Josh-	you can map the other to make the same code
2012-10-18T12:54:00.000Z	actionParsnip	Josh-	xrandr is in a default install
2012-10-18T12:54:00.000Z	Josh-	actionParsnip	It seems G++ can't find it
2012-10-18T12:54:00.000Z	actionParsnip	Josh-	how are you calling it?
2012-10-18T12:55:00.000Z	Josh-	actionParsnip	-Xrandr
2012-10-18T12:56:00.000Z	actionParsnip	Josh-	shouldn't it all be lower case?
2012-10-18T12:57:00.000Z	Josh-	actionParsnip	No?
2012-10-18T12:57:00.000Z	Josh-	actionParsnip	It was working as is on Ubuntu 12.04 installed on Wubi
2012-10-18T12:58:00.000Z	actionParsnip	Josh-	the installs areidentical. With Wubi you use a file stored in NTFS which is loop mounted at boot. The OS and hardware access is identical in every way
2012-10-18T12:58:00.000Z	Josh-	actionParsnip	Exactly
2012-10-18T13:00:00.000Z	Josh-	actionParsnip	Can't find -lxrandr -lXrandr
