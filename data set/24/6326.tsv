2005-11-22T06:49:00.000Z	meheren		instead of this double click thing
2005-11-22T06:49:00.000Z	meheren		(im used to mac)

2005-11-22T06:49:00.000Z	cafuego	meheren	Yes
2005-12-25T15:45:00.000Z	cafuego	meheren	'sudo apt-get install wmaker'
2006-03-21T15:26:00.000Z	cafuego	meheren	i686 then
2006-03-21T15:27:00.000Z	cafuego	meheren	... so I am supposed to just guess?
2006-03-21T15:27:00.000Z	meheren	cafuego	i don't have the option for the i686... i showed u all my options (or rather told...)
2006-03-21T15:27:00.000Z	cafuego	meheren	Ah, linux-386 (It will auto-fetch the latest version)
2006-03-21T15:28:00.000Z	cafuego	meheren	(They will in fact all install the same kernel anyway, only linux-i386 will keep auto-upgrading it)
2006-03-21T15:28:00.000Z	meheren	cafuego	oh lol... well thx
2006-03-21T15:30:00.000Z	meheren	cafuego	since you seem to no about kernels what should i put on a dell inspirion 8200?
2006-03-21T15:30:00.000Z	cafuego	meheren	Well, there ptobably won't be much performance difference.
2006-03-21T15:30:00.000Z	cafuego	meheren	Dell is all i686 unless it's over 8 years old.
2006-03-21T15:30:00.000Z	meheren	cafuego	k.... so i686 on all dells...
2006-03-21T15:31:00.000Z	meheren	cafuego	7500 included?
2006-03-21T15:31:00.000Z	cafuego	meheren	Yep, except on their Itanium servers.
2006-03-21T15:32:00.000Z	meheren	cafuego	well never heard of a itanium server so.... lol
2006-03-21T15:32:00.000Z	cafuego	meheren	Intels attempt at a 64bit architecture. Costs about as much as a cray these days.
2006-03-21T15:33:00.000Z	meheren	cafuego	what is the difference between the i386 and i686 kernels it can't be that much if they both run on a 386 and 686 cpu...
2006-03-21T15:33:00.000Z	cafuego	meheren	i386 also runs on pentiums and 486es, has some bakcward compatibility stuff
