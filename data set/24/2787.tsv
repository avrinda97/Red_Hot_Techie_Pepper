2008-08-19T19:25:00.000Z	unop	relinker	that wouldn't work .. try.   echo blah | sudo tee /path/to/file
2008-08-19T19:26:00.000Z	unop	relinker	or tee -a  if you want to append to the file
2008-08-19T19:27:00.000Z	unop	relinker	 sudo echo blah > file  # will fail miserably
2008-08-19T19:27:00.000Z	unop	relinker	see my last post to you.
2008-08-19T19:28:00.000Z	relinker	unop	Doing the tee :)
2008-08-19T19:28:00.000Z	relinker	unop	the file permissions are 444 - is it OK to change them to 644
2008-08-19T19:28:00.000Z	unop	relinker	well, that depends on what you want the file to do

2008-08-19T19:30:00.000Z	unop	relinker	well, 444 does fine if all you want is to be able to read from the file
2008-08-19T19:31:00.000Z	unop	relinker	keep 444 if all you are doing is changing something inside the file.
2008-08-19T19:32:00.000Z	unop	relinker	root can write to any file .. irrespective of permissions
2008-08-19T19:34:00.000Z	relinker	unop	Did that - (| sudo tee ) file contents did not change
2008-08-19T19:34:00.000Z	unop	relinker	paste your exact command here.
2008-08-19T19:34:00.000Z	relinker	unop	 echo ondemand | sudo tee scaling_governor
2008-08-19T19:35:00.000Z	unop	relinker	and the output of pwd?
2008-08-19T19:35:00.000Z	relinker	unop	/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq
2008-08-19T19:37:00.000Z	unop	relinker	hmm, not sure why this is
2008-08-19T19:37:00.000Z	unop	relinker	try removing the file before attempting this.
2008-08-19T19:38:00.000Z	unop	relinker	ok, and?
2008-08-19T19:38:00.000Z	relinker	unop	I mean, err, can I remove a file from /sys, /proc etc.?
2008-08-19T19:40:00.000Z	unop	relinker	could explain why  echo blah > file  is unsuccessful
2008-08-19T19:41:00.000Z	relinker	unop	For that the recco method is to echo "ondemand" into the /sys file
2008-08-19T19:44:00.000Z	relinker	unop	is my intention clear - have i explained my problem?
