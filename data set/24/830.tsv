2011-01-29T19:38:00.000Z	novitololo		yes, but what I want to is write files to /var/www, that's why I created a group ('web') with permissions for the folder.  But you recommend doing this: ': a . chown /var/www to www-data user , b. add your user to www-data group'.  Why?
2011-01-29T19:39:00.000Z	novitololo		Right now I can, because my user is in 'web' group, and this group has permissions for the /var/www
2011-01-29T19:40:00.000Z	novitololo		what I don't get is why would we put www-data group in the middle
2011-01-29T19:41:00.000Z	novitololo		but will I have problems with the apache?
2011-01-29T19:42:00.000Z	novitololo		mmm
2011-01-29T19:42:00.000Z	novitololo		because mneptok told me this ''mneptok: novitololo: sure, but i would use the existing group. the way you have things now, your webroot wil have to be world-readable in order for Apache to serve the pages''
2011-01-29T19:43:00.000Z	jrib	novitololo	you shouldn't have web data owned by www-data and writable by www-data unless you specifically want apache to be able to write to those files
2011-01-29T19:43:00.000Z	novitololo	jrib	ok then I will leave it the way I have it. A group called 'web' can write into that folder.  Thanks
2011-01-29T19:46:00.000Z	jrib	novitololo	not with usual permissions, but you can setup and use ACLs, then yes :)
2011-01-29T19:46:00.000Z	novitololo	jrib	thanks :)
2011-02-28T19:04:00.000Z	jrib	novitololo	in preferences for the vm you can choose to have it use your cd-rom
2011-06-15T18:53:00.000Z	jrib	novitololo	you say you "tried", what went wrong?
2011-06-15T18:54:00.000Z	novitololo	jrib	So far I can go to ~/Komodo/bin and doing sudo ./komodo launches the editor.  In order to be able to launch komodo from terminal I did "sudo ln -s ~/Komodo/bin/komodo /usr/local/bin/komodo".  But is not working
2011-06-15T18:55:00.000Z	jrib	novitololo	what happens when you try...?
2011-06-15T18:55:00.000Z	jrib	novitololo	type "hash -r" and try again
2011-06-15T18:56:00.000Z	novitololo	jrib	same...
2011-06-15T18:56:00.000Z	jrib	novitololo	pastebin the output of: ls -l /usr/local/bin/komodo; echo $PATH; komodo
2011-06-15T18:57:00.000Z	novitololo	jrib	here you go: http://pastebin.com/0Rq4wSEQ
2011-06-15T18:58:00.000Z	jrib	novitololo	you did not create the symlink in the manner you described, recreate it
2011-06-15T19:00:00.000Z	novitololo	jrib	I should have mentioned the version of Komodo, I created like this: sudo ln -s ~/Komodo-Edit-6/bin/komodo /usr/local/bin/komodo
2011-06-15T19:00:00.000Z	jrib	novitololo	it seems like you did not use "~/" when you created it.
2011-06-15T19:00:00.000Z	novitololo	jrib	sorry, that's right.
2011-06-15T19:01:00.000Z	jrib	novitololo	you need that :)
2011-06-15T19:01:00.000Z	novitololo	jrib	I created the symlink from inside my ~ and I assumed it would be created there...
