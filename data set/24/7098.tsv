2006-12-13T06:14:00.000Z	green_earz	zim	to install the driver for the card you can use the app modconf : sudo apt-get install modconf  : then sudo modconf and track down the driver for the sound card : but first is the driver all ready install : lsmod | grep snd    and can you see it ?
2006-12-13T06:19:00.000Z	green_earz	zim	its there snd_intel8x0    so are you a member of the auido group ? use the command :  groups   to see
2006-12-13T06:22:00.000Z	green_earz	zim	so driver installed your install auido group so it may be that the sound is muted in alsamixer : use the command alsamixer and see if it a channel that muted
2006-12-13T06:26:00.000Z	zim	green_earz	nothing muted
2006-12-13T06:26:00.000Z	green_earz	zim	turn your volume down and see if the command cat /dev/urandom > /dev/dsp    puts out a sound or any errors on the terminal

2006-12-13T06:38:00.000Z	green_earz	zim	the out put looks ok may be that the sound app is not config to alsa. fire up xmms and have a look at if its using alsa as its sound demom
2006-12-13T06:40:00.000Z	green_earz	zim	yes sudo apt-get install xmms
