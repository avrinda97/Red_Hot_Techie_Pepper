2006-07-26T15:49:00.000Z	Alpha232	confused	hold down the control key, the alt key and press F1
2006-07-26T15:50:00.000Z	confused	Alpha232	it's a special combo so me personally id call it a cmd ;)

2006-07-26T15:52:00.000Z	confused	Alpha232	who sais I have two computers? I can login to windows as im still working out the kinks in kubuntu.. actually I changed the nvidia txt in xorg.conf to nv so I can boot back up to kubuntu
2006-07-26T15:52:00.000Z	confused	Alpha232	shall I go try ctrl+alt+f1 then?
2006-07-26T16:01:00.000Z	confused	Alpha232	when I do ctrl+alt+1 it brings me to the terminal login screen
2006-07-26T16:02:00.000Z	Alpha232	confused	so your computer is not frozen, its just that you botched your settings for X, login and undo them
2006-07-26T16:02:00.000Z	Alpha232	confused	you did backup your config first right?
2006-07-26T16:02:00.000Z	confused	Alpha232	I dont know that much about linux but I would have tried that cmd (w/e you wanna call it) but I was up 17 hours with no sleep :X
2006-07-26T16:02:00.000Z	confused	Alpha232	let me check
2006-07-26T16:03:00.000Z	confused	Alpha232	nope :X
2006-07-26T16:04:00.000Z	confused	Alpha232	I believe the first time I had to get nvidia to work it worked the first time I did it but now it wont :| (had to reinstall)
2006-07-26T16:09:00.000Z	confused	Alpha232	shall I wait?
