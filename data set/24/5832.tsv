2007-12-15T22:24:00.000Z	wy		I'm trying to reinstall linux-restricted-modules. But the package manager warns that the package can't be authenticated. What can I do to ensure it's from correct repository?
2007-12-15T22:25:00.000Z	nickrud	wy	sudo apt-get update (they're just out of date)
2007-12-15T22:26:00.000Z	wy	nickrud	You are right!
2007-12-15T22:27:00.000Z	nickrud	wy	reinstall the packages that you overwrote, that's about it
2007-12-15T22:28:00.000Z	wy	nickrud	Thanks! Currently I found a mistakenly deleted /lib/modules/2.6.22-14-generic/kernel/drivers/char/drm/fglrx.ko, but I can't find where it is from
2007-12-15T22:29:00.000Z	nickrud	wy	that's in linux-restricted-modules
2007-12-15T22:29:00.000Z	wy	nickrud	I reinstalled linux-restricted-modules-generic, but it's still not there
2007-12-15T22:35:00.000Z	nickrud	wy	still looking
2007-12-15T22:35:00.000Z	wy	nickrud	Thanks!
2007-12-15T22:37:00.000Z	nickrud	wy	it's wierd I don't see that
2007-12-15T22:37:00.000Z	wy	nickrud	But do you have ATI card?
2007-12-15T22:38:00.000Z	nickrud	wy	yes
2007-12-15T22:39:00.000Z	wy	nickrud	So you don't have it in that directory?
2007-12-15T22:39:00.000Z	wy	nickrud	Could you find flgrx.ko in /lib/modules to see where it is?
2007-12-15T22:40:00.000Z	nickrud	wy	the ati drivers drop it into /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/misc
2007-12-15T22:43:00.000Z	wy	nickrud	Strange. I don't even have that directory. Did you install it from a package?
2007-12-15T22:44:00.000Z	nickrud	wy	I find it in /lib/modules/2.6.22-14-generic/volatile/fglrx.ko
2007-12-15T22:45:00.000Z	wy	nickrud	Now I found one in /lib/modules/2.6.22-14-generic/volatile/fglrx.ko. Hmmm... So I guess it will be copied to that directory after restart
2007-12-15T22:46:00.000Z	wy	nickrud	Oh, can you find /lib/modules/2.6.22-14-generic/kernel/drivers/char/drm/fglrx.ko ?
2007-12-15T22:46:00.000Z	nickrud	wy	no, the one we found is the only one I have in /usr/lib/modules/2.22..generic
2007-12-15T22:47:00.000Z	wy	nickrud	I'll restart my X and see. See you later!
2007-12-15T22:47:00.000Z	nickrud	wy	and that's where I expected it with the ubuntu driver (memory finally kicked in)
2007-12-15T22:48:00.000Z	wy	nickrud	I'm back. It seems to work
2007-12-15T22:50:00.000Z	wy	nickrud	Can you use compiz with this driver?
