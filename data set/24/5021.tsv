2006-11-25T17:11:00.000Z	brainsforsale		yea
2006-11-25T17:11:00.000Z	brainsforsale		i read that
2006-11-25T17:11:00.000Z	brainsforsale		but i need to know if I will be able to use it to change channels on comcast digital cable
2006-11-25T17:12:00.000Z	GenNMX	brainsforsale	Just not for channels above 99
2006-11-25T17:12:00.000Z	GenNMX	brainsforsale	For that, you'd need an IR Blaster.
2006-11-25T17:12:00.000Z	GenNMX	brainsforsale	No, it can't change channels on the cable box, you need an IR Blaster for that.
2006-11-25T17:14:00.000Z	GenNMX	brainsforsale	If you want the card to change channels, you need to connect the cable directly to the card
2006-11-25T17:15:00.000Z	GenNMX	brainsforsale	But your best bet is an IR Blaster if you want to use the Cable Box
2006-11-25T17:15:00.000Z	GenNMX	brainsforsale	Only for channels above 99
2006-11-25T17:15:00.000Z	GenNMX	brainsforsale	Channels below 99, "Basic Cable", do not need the cable box
2006-11-25T17:16:00.000Z	GenNMX	brainsforsale	OK, that's a Motorolla, that should at least have a firewire port
2006-11-25T17:17:00.000Z	GenNMX	brainsforsale	Yes.
2006-11-25T17:18:00.000Z	GenNMX	brainsforsale	It's called, of all amazing terminology, a splitter!
2006-11-25T17:20:00.000Z	GenNMX	brainsforsale	If you want to watch TV and record, you need either a TV itself or another tuner card. You can just buy a cheap tuner card that doesn't have hardware recording capabilities, they go for as little as $40. You'll need a splitter regardless.
2006-11-25T17:24:00.000Z	GenNMX	brainsforsale	You know, Comcast has a DVR setup for $15/month. If you think of paying $90 to $100 for your TV Tuner card, and setting it up, etc., I don't think it's such a big deal. The Comcast DVR box is a Dual Tuner, meaning you can watch TV and record at the same time, and has a firewire port with both Windows and Linux drivers, so you can transfer off the box to your HDD if you want.
2006-11-25T17:26:00.000Z	GenNMX	brainsforsale	Except the Linux box doesn't do HD or any other newer format ;) With leasing, you get the latest technology. Personally, I would wait until on the Linux box until the cable companies and Tuner cards come out with CableCard-ready, so you don't need a cable box, period.
2006-11-25T17:27:00.000Z	GenNMX	brainsforsale	HD Tuner Cards are just for HD signals over the air, not from a cable provider
