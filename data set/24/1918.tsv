2010-01-23T15:32:00.000Z	iflema	CAiRO	have you been messing with user access rights? whats the kernel version on troubled os?.... did you compile it yourself? whats the file system on the flash disk?
2010-01-23T15:33:00.000Z	CAiRO	iflema	no, i haven't except for adding my user to groups like audio, i'm using 8.04 with a 2.6.24-26 kernel
2010-01-23T15:34:00.000Z	CAiRO	iflema	the stick has a fat filesystem and yes, i've rebuild the ubuntu kernel image but only the PAE option changed
2010-01-23T15:34:00.000Z	CAiRO	iflema	everything else is the same
2010-01-23T15:34:00.000Z	CAiRO	iflema	i can mount the sticks as root using mount on the command line
2010-01-23T15:34:00.000Z	CAiRO		but i want it to happen automatically as on my notebook
2010-01-23T15:34:00.000Z	iflema	CAiRO	ok\
2010-01-23T15:35:00.000Z	CAiRO	iflema	i wonder how to debug this? where can i see message of something failing if i click on my stick from the places menu and nothing happens?
2010-01-23T15:37:00.000Z	iflema	CAiRO	this kernel recompile you did a complete copy bar the added PAE support?
2010-01-23T15:37:00.000Z	CAiRO	iflema	i've created my own "pae flavour" as some of the howtos in the net recommend
2010-01-23T15:38:00.000Z	iflema	CAiRO	debug question a good one.... off top of head not sure
2010-01-23T15:38:00.000Z	CAiRO	iflema	if i knew how to see the command that nautilus or the gnome panels tries to run
2010-01-23T15:38:00.000Z	CAiRO	iflema	i could probably spot the error
2010-01-23T15:39:00.000Z	CAiRO	iflema	but my first problem is that nautlis always detaches itself from the terminal and seems to have no debug option
2010-01-23T15:40:00.000Z	iflema	CAiRO	start it with a terminal gksu nautilus and watch the terminal for output...
2010-01-23T15:41:00.000Z	CAiRO	iflema	as root, it works strangely
2010-01-23T15:41:00.000Z	iflema	CAiRO	maybe
2010-01-23T15:46:00.000Z	CAiRO	iflema	when i do it as root i can see entries like "Jan 23 11:40:56 belana hald: mounted /dev/sdd1 on behalf of uid 0" in my syslog
2010-01-23T15:46:00.000Z	CAiRO		but not if i do it as user
2010-01-23T15:51:00.000Z	CAiRO	iflema	just for your information, gnome-mount -vbd seems to have the debug output
2010-01-23T15:53:00.000Z	iflema	CAiRO	not there outda box...... but thank u.
2010-01-23T15:57:00.000Z	iflema	CAiRO	hope ya find what ya need..... im worried because of the custom kernel and the adding of users to groups.... you have this trouble.... voids ya support warranty ;) its hard to know exactly what you have been up 2. sorry im not of more useful
2010-01-23T15:58:00.000Z	CAiRO	iflema	no problem, i've found a workaround meanwhile
2010-01-23T15:58:00.000Z	CAiRO	iflema	its somehow connected to the policy kit
