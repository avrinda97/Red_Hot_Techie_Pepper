2010-04-08T21:12:00.000Z	ayrus		hi, I'm new to Ubuntu. Please tell me how to install the VGA drivers. I downloaded from the site.
2010-04-08T21:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ayrus	 clarify exactly what you downloaded from what site. for what card.
2010-04-08T21:22:00.000Z	ayrus	Dr_Willis	yes I got that.
2010-04-08T21:14:00.000Z	ayrus	Dr_Willis	my motherboard is asus p5sd2-vm. and I downloaded the driver package given on the asus website. But I don;t know how to install these
2010-04-08T21:16:00.000Z	ayrus	Dr_Willis	Its showing four sub folder in VGA folder listed as FC6, Mandriva2007.1, Redhat4.4, SuSE10.1
2010-04-08T21:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ayrus	what chipset/video card is it using.. thats the Core thing. You dont normally just download 'drivers' you use thepacakge manager to install the proper drivers.
2010-04-08T21:17:00.000Z	ayrus	Dr_Willis	Which folder should I open for VGA
2010-04-08T21:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ayrus	 'vga' means nothing the way you are mentioning it.   its what CHIPSET your video is that matters
2010-04-08T21:18:00.000Z	ayrus	Dr_Willis	Chipset: NorthBridge: SIS 672 and Shouth Bridge: SIS 968
2010-04-08T21:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ayrus	 go to  System -> admin -> hardware drivers  and see what it shows..
2010-04-08T21:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ayrus	 SIS? Egads.. thats not a good sign. :)
2010-04-08T21:20:00.000Z	ayrus	Dr_Willis	I can;t find the admin folder in File system. Where is it placed?
2010-04-08T21:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ayrus	 expore  your menus.. its under  SYSTEM in the menus..
2010-04-08T21:21:00.000Z	ayrus	Dr_Willis	You do not have permission to open the content in root folder...
2010-04-08T21:21:00.000Z	ayrus	Dr_Willis	Error something like that.
2010-04-08T21:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ayrus	 In the top panel.. see a MENU item called 'System'? it has a Administration sub menu..
2010-04-08T21:23:00.000Z	ayrus	Dr_Willis	I go to hardware Drivers, after searching the drivers its showing the message: " No Proprietary drivers are in use on this system"
2010-04-08T21:24:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ayrus	 yep. SIS cards really suck.  but  are you haveing other real issues? low res? no Desktop?> or what exactly?
2010-04-08T21:25:00.000Z	ayrus	Dr_Willis	Less resolution and less refresh rate. My moniter resolution is 1440*900 but its not displaying
2010-04-08T21:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ayrus	 check the forums for that exact chipset/video  - it may need some tweaks/updates.  But every time someone mentions 'sis' its always problematic. The companies linux support is.. not too great.
2010-04-08T21:26:00.000Z	ayrus	Dr_Willis	Its showing the resolution of 1280*1024
2010-04-08T21:27:00.000Z	ayrus	Dr_Willis	Ohk... can you give me the link of the forum please.
2010-04-08T21:28:00.000Z	ayrus	Dr_Willis	 I have the drivers. can the drivers for Mandriva will not work on Ubuntu?
2010-04-08T21:30:00.000Z	ayrus	Dr_Willis	in the Mandriva folder, there is a read me file. and there is written" copy the files to the drivers directory. these are having ext sis_drv.la and sis_drv.so Is the copying of the files to the driver folder not work? Please tell
