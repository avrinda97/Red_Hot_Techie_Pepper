2008-08-31T08:25:00.000Z	falemant		yo what partition does grub need to be installed to?
2008-08-31T08:25:00.000Z	falemant		i mean if it's not installed to the MBR
2008-08-31T08:25:00.000Z	falemant		i have a /boot partition
2008-08-31T08:26:00.000Z	falemant		should GRUB be installed to the /boot partition or the / partition?
2008-08-31T08:26:00.000Z	falemant		anyone know the answer?
2008-08-31T08:27:00.000Z	bobertdos	falemant	boot, ordinarily.......Usually Ubuntu itself can handle installing Grub on its own. Are you having problems?
2008-08-31T08:27:00.000Z	falemant		yea bobertdos i'm having problems
2008-08-31T08:27:00.000Z	falemant		i just installed  grub again to the /boot partition
2008-08-31T08:27:00.000Z	falemant		using the livecd
2008-08-31T08:28:00.000Z	falemant		i triedto boot and it said it couldnt find the operating system
2008-08-31T08:28:00.000Z	bobertdos	falemant	Are you dual-booting Ubuntu and Windows?
2008-08-31T08:28:00.000Z	falemant	bobertdos	i am dual booting, but i didn't do anything to the MBR
2008-08-31T08:28:00.000Z	falemant		windows and ubuntu are on separate drives
2008-08-31T08:29:00.000Z	bobertdos	falemant	Which did you install first?
2008-08-31T08:29:00.000Z	falemant		windows
2008-08-31T08:29:00.000Z	falemant		aight just to put it to bed, when i try to boot from the drive with ubuntu on it (from the one time boot menu) it says it can't find an operating system and  i have to restart
2008-08-31T08:29:00.000Z	falemant		windows boots just fine because i didnt touch the mbr and it's on a different drive
2008-08-31T08:30:00.000Z	bobertdos	falemant	As is frequently the case, it sounds like Windows bootloader has taken control. Have you read the wiki article on reinstalling grub?
2008-08-31T08:31:00.000Z	falemant		what do you mean that windows bootloader has taken control?
2008-08-31T08:31:00.000Z	falemant		i have read that wiki article
2008-08-31T08:31:00.000Z	falemant		in fact i did the whole grub reinstall thing
2008-08-31T08:31:00.000Z	falemant		i havent restarted since then
2008-08-31T08:31:00.000Z	falemant		though
2008-08-31T08:32:00.000Z	bobertdos	falemant	Does this look familiar?
