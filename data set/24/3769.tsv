2008-08-16T11:03:00.000Z	devo		and how would i look @ my log's???
2008-08-16T11:03:00.000Z	devo		i'm a noob when it come's with linux, i know a little bit here & there but not enough to get by
2008-08-16T11:05:00.000Z	devo		but how will i know if i have though, that's my ?
2008-08-16T11:05:00.000Z	zcat[1]	devo	yes you have...
2008-08-16T11:05:00.000Z	zcat[1]	devo	you're paranoid. but are you paranoid enough?
2008-08-16T11:06:00.000Z	zcat[1]	devo	chk4rootkit I think, there are some others
2008-08-16T11:07:00.000Z	zcat[1]	devo	also just looking at /var/log/auth.log occasionally is a good idea
2008-08-16T11:08:00.000Z	zcat[1]	devo	ubuntu is pretty secure by default, if you're not adding publically accessable services like apache or ftp I wound't be too worried about it
2008-08-16T11:11:00.000Z	zcat[1]	devo	well, as a rule the problem with things like that in windows is that it's easy to download a program instead of the file you wanted, and accidentally run it.. linux makes it much harder to accidentally run programs if you do download one, and also simply won't run windows trojans anyhow.. and there aren't really any linux trojans or viruses
2008-08-16T11:14:00.000Z	zcat[1]	devo	you pretty much need to go out of your way to find anything and set about running it as a program...
2008-08-16T11:16:00.000Z	zcat[1]	devo	no, that would be openbsd
2008-08-16T11:17:00.000Z	zcat[1]	devo	but generally no, viruses in linux are simply not a problem.
2008-08-16T11:18:00.000Z	zcat[1]	devo	and anonymous will blow up your yellow van!
2008-08-16T11:19:00.000Z	zcat[1]	devo	just run it, stick to packaged software, and be as stupid as you like.. I visit all kinds of 'attack sites' and never picked up anything malicious...
2008-08-16T11:20:00.000Z	zcat[1]	devo	serials.ws .. ummm xp-vista-scan.com I think was mentioned on the reg today, so I went there...
2008-08-16T11:21:00.000Z	zcat[1]	devo	seriosly, just normal surfing is never a problem. I deliberately go to 'bad sits' and that's not a problem.. so normal surfing has to be safe!
2008-08-16T11:25:00.000Z	zcat[1]	devo	basically no...
2008-08-16T11:26:00.000Z	zcat[1]	devo	you might download some viruses, but they just won't do anything unless you go to really extraordinary effort to install wine, associate them, and run them.. and even then they'll only have any effect inside the wine environment
2008-08-16T11:32:00.000Z	zcat[1]	devo	add/remove or synaptic are much friendlier. YOu don't have to use the terminal and apt-get if you don't want to
2008-08-16T11:34:00.000Z	zcat[1]	devo	easy. Install openbsd instead ;)
2008-08-16T11:35:00.000Z	zcat[1]	devo	how secure do you need it to be?!!
2008-08-16T11:36:00.000Z	zcat[1]	devo	you're already there
