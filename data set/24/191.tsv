2012-06-15T02:00:00.000Z	bibi23		hi, has someone already connected its ubuntu to its tv with HDMI? I can't have the sound.. I've followed some tutorial but still nothing
2012-06-15T02:01:00.000Z	bibi23		when I run sudo apt-get install libasound2-plugins "pulseaudio-*" padevchooser paman pavucontrol paprefs pavumeter I have some missin packages
2012-06-15T02:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bibi23	can you give the output of: wget -O alsa-info.sh http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-info.sh && chmod +x ./alsa-info.sh && ./alsa-info.sh
2012-06-15T02:02:00.000Z	bibi23	ActionParsnip	Your ALSA information is in /tmp/alsa-info.txt.HpD2uMDW3j
2012-06-15T02:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bibi23	ok run:  gedit /tmp/alsa-info.txt.HpD2uMDW3j    and pastebin the file, if you'd selected YES to upload to teh server it would have done it for you
2012-06-15T02:09:00.000Z	bibi23	ActionParsnip	it's a big file, here it is : http://pastebin.com/xa2TPiVs
2012-06-15T02:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bibi23	if you run the sound config app, is the HDMI set as the output?
2012-06-15T02:12:00.000Z	bibi23	ActionParsnip	you're talking about  gstreamer-properties? yes I can see an HDMI 0 sound output, but when I select it and click the test button, no sound, when I select the other andd click test, it does an horrible sound test
2012-06-15T02:13:00.000Z	bibi23	ActionParsnip	when I say the other one it's just my laptop not the tv
2012-06-15T02:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bibi23	the sound app, in dash
2012-06-15T02:15:00.000Z	bibi23	ActionParsnip	sorry I don't get it, wich app?
2012-06-15T02:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bibi23	press SuperL (aka 'windows key') and search for 'sound'
2012-06-15T02:18:00.000Z	bibi23	ActionParsnip	ah no you mean by the standard one, no this one doesn't detect anything, only my  laptop sound
2012-06-15T02:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bibi23	are there any bugs for teh make and model of the laptop?
2012-06-15T02:21:00.000Z	bibi23	ActionParsnip	it's a r540, I've found this : http://www.voria.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1040 , should I run the same commands than him ? sudo aitconfig ...
2012-06-15T02:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bibi23	try it is all I can say
2012-06-15T02:24:00.000Z	bibi23	ActionParsnip	ok, there is no risk to loose anything sound or image?
2012-06-15T02:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bibi23	your backups will take care of that
2012-06-15T02:27:00.000Z	bibi23	ActionParsnip	aticonfig doesn't look installed, if I do apt-get aticonfig doesn't find it neither...
2012-06-15T02:29:00.000Z	bibi23	ActionParsnip	ok thanks
2012-06-15T02:32:00.000Z	bibi23	ActionParsnip	I went to hardware drivers and 2 ATI drivers weren't activated, it's currently being installed, I'm full of hope :)
2012-06-15T02:39:00.000Z	bibi23	ActionParsnip	now the command works, but "No layout section was found in the file: '/etc/X11/xorg.conf'." for sudo aticonfig --set-pcs-u32=DDX,EnableTearFreeDesktop,1 , ....
2012-06-15T02:58:00.000Z	bibi23	ActionParsnip	woww it worked!!! I only had to go to the hardware drivers and install that ati driver, then reboot, now  the hdmi is display as an output in the sound app, and it works, great, thanks man ;)
2012-06-15T02:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bibi23	np dude. simple stuff :)
