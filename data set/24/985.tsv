2010-09-24T00:57:00.000Z	Kyle__		Whoohoo!  I signed up for google's android app-inventor the day it came out, and I just got my login info today!  Only two months later....
2010-09-24T00:59:00.000Z	Kyle__		th^2: Eh.  Probably not.  The netbook remix oddly isn't as nice on my netbook as full blown.
2010-09-24T00:59:00.000Z	th^2	Kyle__	ok..
2010-09-24T02:02:00.000Z	Kyle__	th^2	Are you running ubuntu desktop or server?
2010-09-24T02:03:00.000Z	th^2	Kyle__	desktop
2010-09-24T02:03:00.000Z	Kyle__	th^2	CUPS really doesn't eat up much memory or CPU at all.  It doesn't get in the way
2010-09-24T02:03:00.000Z	Kyle__	th^2	Then cups was installed by default.
2010-09-24T02:03:00.000Z	th^2	Kyle__	yes and i removed it. now it wants to do a new install.
2010-09-24T02:04:00.000Z	Kyle__	th^2	probably because one of the things that was updated requires it.  Why do you want it gone so badly?
2010-09-24T02:04:00.000Z	th^2	Kyle__	i dont want useless programs
2010-09-24T02:05:00.000Z	Kyle__	th^2	There are plenty of other, more useless, more intrusive programs that ubuntu comes with.
2010-09-24T02:05:00.000Z	Kyle__	th^2	If you don't want useless programs, you need to look for another distro.  Really.
2010-09-24T02:05:00.000Z	th^2	Kyle__	yes and im gettin rid of them
2010-09-24T02:06:00.000Z	th^2	Kyle__	that is true. used gentoo for a long time. but i really hate to install new distros. i pick one and stick to it
2010-09-24T02:06:00.000Z	Kyle__	th^2	As much as ubuntu annoys me sometimes, I use it because I want up to date packages I don't have to compile myself.
2010-09-24T02:07:00.000Z	Kyle__	th^2	If I recall correctly, any-and-every program that prints in ubuntu, is linked to cups.
2010-09-24T02:07:00.000Z	th^2	Kyle__	that is true. ie with slackware you have to compile like everything because repos are so small
2010-09-24T02:08:00.000Z	Kyle__	th^2	CUPS is pretty cool, work keeping around even.  Go remove F-spot or something useless :)
2010-09-24T02:09:00.000Z	Kyle__	th^2	to run when you log in?  Well there is the GUI... I used that today since .login isn't respected (grr!).
2010-09-24T02:09:00.000Z	Kyle__	th^2	But using it without a gui would be what I really want.
2010-09-24T02:10:00.000Z	th^2	Kyle__	i dont want to learn GUI ways to do things
2010-09-24T02:11:00.000Z	Kyle__	th^2	Me neither, but this is a very gnome-specific distro sometimes.
2010-09-24T02:11:00.000Z	th^2	Kyle__	too true. this is too unfree for me
2010-09-24T02:12:00.000Z	Kyle__	th^2	sorry dude.
