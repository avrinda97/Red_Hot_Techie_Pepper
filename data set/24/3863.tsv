2007-09-28T16:37:00.000Z	overlord		i had installed beryl manager, it was working fine in the beginning, but after sometime it stopped working. then i read on the forums that it is no longer supported, so i removed it and went for compiz instead

2007-09-28T05:32:00.000Z	murkyMurk	overlord	feisty, dapper or edgy?
2007-09-28T05:34:00.000Z	murkyMurk	overlord	they've called it realplay not realplayer
2007-09-28T05:36:00.000Z	murkyMurk	overlord	hmmm, i'm reading the i386 file list...realplay is there...do a sudo apt-cache seacrh real and see what turns up
2007-09-28T05:37:00.000Z	murkyMurk	overlord	*search
2007-09-28T05:37:00.000Z	overlord	murkyMurk	maybe x64 version isn't available??
2007-09-28T05:37:00.000Z	murkyMurk	overlord	ahhh...i'll just check
2007-09-28T05:39:00.000Z	murkyMurk	overlord	can confirm the package list at that repo for x64 is an empty file
2007-09-28T05:40:00.000Z	overlord	murkyMurk	so, what do i do now? and, i can't even get the file of x86 version at that repo
2007-09-28T05:41:00.000Z	overlord	murkyMurk	i'm trying for MPlayer instead
2007-09-28T05:41:00.000Z	murkyMurk	overlord	the problem will be with your x64....a lot of apps just don't have 64bit versions yet ;-(
2007-09-28T05:43:00.000Z	overlord	murkyMurk	hmm..thanks for the help, installing MPlayer now, it has .rmvb decoder
2007-09-28T05:43:00.000Z	murkyMurk	overlord	good luck
