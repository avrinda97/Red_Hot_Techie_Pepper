2010-09-24T18:20:00.000Z	crankygeek		llutzDo I need to have squid setup in order to make ssh tunneling work?
2010-09-24T18:20:00.000Z	llutz	crankygeek	no
2010-09-24T18:14:00.000Z	llutz	crankygeek	putty - connections - ssh - tunnels - Source Port 7070 /Destination localhost Dynamic/Auto - Add
2010-09-24T18:21:00.000Z	llutz	crankygeek	create an "dynamic tunnel" and setup your browser to use it as socks5 proxy on localhost:port
2010-09-24T18:22:00.000Z	crankygeek	llutz	I configured it like you stated but I can't pull a page, not even via ip address on that network
2010-09-24T18:22:00.000Z	llutz	crankygeek	have you configured your browser accordingly?
2010-09-24T18:24:00.000Z	crankygeek	llutz	I have IE set to use a proxy server of localhost port 7070, and bypass proxy on local addresses
2010-09-24T18:24:00.000Z	llutz	crankygeek	it has to be SOCKS proxy, not normal (http) proxy
2010-09-24T18:26:00.000Z	crankygeek	llutz	ok, I went into the advanced settings and put local host and port 7070 in SOCKS
2010-09-24T18:27:00.000Z	llutz	crankygeek	"localhost" without space. see http://bit.ly/d7Ne5N
2010-09-24T18:28:00.000Z	crankygeek	llutz	should I use the word localhost, even if that is not the name of my server?
2010-09-24T18:28:00.000Z	llutz	crankygeek	it has to be "localhost" in putty AND in IE
2010-09-24T18:28:00.000Z	llutz	crankygeek	exactly that word, not your host
2010-09-24T18:31:00.000Z	crankygeek	llutz	still no good, I don't understand why, it can't be my firewall at this place, because I am able to make the ssh connection  :(
2010-09-24T18:34:00.000Z	crankygeek	llutz	still no good, I don't understand why, it can't be my firewall at this place, because I am able to make the ssh connection  :(
2010-09-24T18:35:00.000Z	llutz	crankygeek	have you checked the settings twice (port, dynamic/auto selected)?
2010-09-24T18:35:00.000Z	crankygeek	llutz	I have checked it multiple times
2010-09-24T18:36:00.000Z	llutz	crankygeek	no idea then, sorry
2010-09-24T18:37:00.000Z	crankygeek	llutz	after I hit add it populates with D7070 in PuTTY
2010-09-24T18:37:00.000Z	llutz	crankygeek	thats right
2010-09-24T18:40:00.000Z	crankygeek	llutz	I got it......I had to disconnect everything and reconnect.....strange that I did that before, but I guess it never took
2010-09-24T18:41:00.000Z	llutz	crankygeek	anyway, it works, fine
2010-09-24T18:41:00.000Z	crankygeek	llutz	Oooh, I also added "Do not use Proxy server with the following addresses  *.mydomain.com
2010-09-24T18:42:00.000Z	crankygeek	llutz	Thank you so much for your help.....
