2005-10-03T16:43:00.000Z	thread		how is networking supposed to work now that I'm in breezy? is it supposed to come up from the 'networking' init script still? How do I configure it with my wireless encryption key etc? does it integrate with Network-Manager or -- how does it work?
2005-10-03T06:31:00.000Z	thread		anybody update to breezy and lose their synaptic touchpad driver?
2005-10-03T06:31:00.000Z	thread		it fails to find my touchpad
2005-10-03T06:32:00.000Z	BlueEagle	thread	It fails to find it or it doesn't load a driver for it?
2005-10-03T06:32:00.000Z	BlueEagle	thread	it is gone from lspci?
2005-10-03T06:33:00.000Z	BlueEagle	thread	Where did you see it then?
2005-10-03T06:34:00.000Z	BlueEagle	thread	Which driver is it trying to load for it?
2005-10-03T06:35:00.000Z	thread	BlueEagle	/dev/psaux
2005-10-03T06:36:00.000Z	BlueEagle	thread	...and is that the correct device? (ie. the same device as it used before)
2005-10-03T06:36:00.000Z	thread	BlueEagle	Yes. same as my old xorg.conf
2005-10-03T06:36:00.000Z	BlueEagle	thread	cat /dev/psaux and use your touchpad. If you get lots of characters then it's the right device. If not you might want to look for another device that produces output.
2005-10-03T06:37:00.000Z	thread	BlueEagle	it is the right device
2005-10-03T06:37:00.000Z	BlueEagle	thread	Well, you said that it loaded a driver fine, right?
2005-10-03T06:37:00.000Z	BlueEagle	thread	ie tpconfig found it.
2005-10-03T06:37:00.000Z	thread	BlueEagle	that's the driver it should be using
2005-10-03T06:38:00.000Z	thread	BlueEagle	ldd tpconfig reveals that it doesn't have jack to do with x
2005-10-03T06:39:00.000Z	BlueEagle	thread	Well, if you can make it work in console you should be able to make it work in X. Now, since tpconfig detects that it is a device it probably is so. The best guess I've got is that it's been moved in the /dev tree.
2005-10-03T06:40:00.000Z	BlueEagle	thread	If you've already tried other possible devices there please tell me now. If not please tell me that you don't appreciate my attempts to help you.
2005-10-03T06:41:00.000Z	thread	BlueEagle	I've tried /dev/input/mice .... cat /dev/psaux does produce output when I move my touchpad
2005-10-03T06:41:00.000Z	thread	BlueEagle	there just seems to be something wrong with x's ability to properly identify my touchpad
2005-10-03T06:41:00.000Z	BlueEagle	thread	Well, try using a generic driver for it in xorg.conf
2005-10-03T06:42:00.000Z	thread	BlueEagle	what you mean? my touchpad is working right now... I want to use the synaptics driver
2005-10-03T06:43:00.000Z	BlueEagle	thread	I see. This is a kernel driver, right?
2005-10-03T06:44:00.000Z	thread	BlueEagle	the synaptics_drv.o of which I speak came with x, and resides in /usr/X11R6/lib/modules/input
