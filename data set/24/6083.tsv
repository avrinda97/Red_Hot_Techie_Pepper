2006-01-21T15:37:00.000Z	raimo		can someone help me... i just tried to install ubuntu and the installation destroyed my old partition
2006-01-21T15:38:00.000Z	raimo		i tried to resize the old partition, it worked on something for a while and then said that it's not possible because of some windows dynamic disk blablabla
2006-01-21T15:39:00.000Z	topyli	raimo	that really isn't a question. or a sentence even. what are you trying to do?
2006-01-21T15:40:00.000Z	topyli	raimo	so you have windows and want to keep it, and install ubuntu dual-boot?
2006-01-21T15:41:00.000Z	raimo	topyli	yeah... but when i did what i just explained, my old partition got lost
2006-01-21T15:41:00.000Z	raimo	topyli	windows says it's not formatted
2006-01-21T15:41:00.000Z	topyli	raimo	windows won't boot?
2006-01-21T15:42:00.000Z	raimo	topyli	it was my secondary drive so luckily that's not the case
2006-01-21T15:43:00.000Z	topyli	raimo	so that part is ok. what does it say is not formatted?
2006-01-21T15:43:00.000Z	raimo	topyli	windows says that drive D: isn't formatted, and that's the drive i tried to resize when i was trying to install ubuntu
2006-01-21T15:44:00.000Z	topyli	raimo	do you have data on D: ?
2006-01-21T15:45:00.000Z	topyli	raimo	hrmpf. so you were trying to resize it and install ubuntu on the newly-freed space?
2006-01-21T15:46:00.000Z	raimo	topyli	yeah, but then it failed because of some windows dynamic disk thing and threw me back to where i was
2006-01-21T15:46:00.000Z	topyli	raimo	i'll have to ask at this point: do you make backups regularly? :-\
2006-01-21T15:48:00.000Z	topyli	raimo	don't worry. it's probably readable on linux
2006-01-21T15:50:00.000Z	topyli	raimo	the worst that could have happened is that the installer resized the parition and screwed up the partition table. in any case, the data is there
2006-01-21T15:50:00.000Z	raimo	topyli	yeah so i thought
2006-01-21T15:50:00.000Z	topyli	raimo	try #ubuntu-fi too
2006-01-21T15:52:00.000Z	topyli	raimo	ok, the ghostbusters are here :)
2006-01-21T15:56:00.000Z	topyli	raimo	i'm not sure about that disk. could be good, but i've never heard of it
2006-01-21T15:57:00.000Z	topyli	raimo	what i'd say is, boot to linux (in one way or another, a live cd maybe) and run linux fdisk to see what it thinks you have there
2006-01-21T16:05:00.000Z	raimo	topyli	ok... i managed to recover the file system \o/
2006-01-21T16:05:00.000Z	topyli	raimo	with this disk?
2006-01-21T16:06:00.000Z	raimo	topyli	with TestDisk yeah
