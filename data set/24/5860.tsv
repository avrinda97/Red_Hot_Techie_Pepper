2006-04-08T11:43:00.000Z	gaurav19		Hi I am new to Linux, I need some help with Ubuntu installation
2006-04-08T11:43:00.000Z	DBO	gaurav19	where are you stuck?
2006-04-08T11:43:00.000Z	gaurav19		thanks DBO, base installation
2006-04-08T11:43:00.000Z	DBO	gaurav19	what part is confusing you?
2006-04-08T11:44:00.000Z	gaurav19		i have three partitions on the master drive,with win xp pro on one of them, I am trying to install Ubuntu on another which has no files. The file system on the partitions is NTFS
2006-04-08T11:45:00.000Z	DBO	gaurav19	are you at the point of the installer where you set up the partitions?
2006-04-08T11:45:00.000Z	gaurav19		The installer keeps telling me that it cant find a base/root
2006-04-08T11:46:00.000Z	gaurav19		yes, DBO i have been there twice
2006-04-08T11:46:00.000Z	DBO	gaurav19	when you get there, go to the part (sorry I dont know the exact quotes here) that lets you manually edit the partitions
2006-04-08T11:46:00.000Z	gaurav19		I did try to edit partitions manually
2006-04-08T11:46:00.000Z	DBO	gaurav19	in there you can delete the partition you want to isntall ubuntu on
2006-04-08T11:47:00.000Z	DBO	gaurav19	then use the option to "go back" or whatever they called it, and select "use largest contiguous free space"
2006-04-08T11:47:00.000Z	DBO		should be easy sailing from there
2006-04-08T11:47:00.000Z	gaurav19		i am not sure, I will have to see that. Do i ned to recreate the partition ?
2006-04-08T11:47:00.000Z	DBO	gaurav19	no, it will do it
2006-04-08T11:48:00.000Z	gaurav19		will largest contiguous free space give me the option to install on a particular partition ?
2006-04-08T11:49:00.000Z	DBO	gaurav19	it will install to whatever partition you deleted in the manual editing step
2006-04-08T11:49:00.000Z	gaurav19		whatever I deleted ?
2006-04-08T11:49:00.000Z	gaurav19		all right DBO, I will try out your suggestions
2006-04-08T11:50:00.000Z	gaurav19		Thanks for your time, DBO
2006-04-08T11:50:00.000Z	DBO	gaurav19	im sorry I cant be more clear, I dont know what it says line for line
2006-04-08T11:50:00.000Z	DBO	gaurav19	but I know your problem, and this is how you fix it
2006-04-08T11:51:00.000Z	gaurav19	DBO	that was enough help, I didnt ecpect more than that. Thanks again!
2006-04-08T11:51:00.000Z	DBO	gaurav19	dont be afraid to ask again if you get stuck
