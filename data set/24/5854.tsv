2007-02-10T11:01:00.000Z	PwcrLinux	Polygon89	yea, I checked upgrade version, still show 7 on website..
2007-02-10T11:03:00.000Z	Polygon89	PwcrLinux	there are two different places where the old flash file could be installed. Did you install using the apt/synaptic/whatever or did you use the tar.gz
2007-02-10T11:06:00.000Z	Polygon89	PwcrLinux	yeah that wont work on linux i believe. i think for me it just always said "could not install" or whatever
2007-02-10T11:06:00.000Z	Polygon89	PwcrLinux	so ill get you instructions on how to upgrade to 9. hold on
2007-02-10T11:08:00.000Z	Polygon89	PwcrLinux	i dont think your distro matters. ok, to get the actual file, simply go to this website: http://www.adobe.com/shockwave/download/download.cgi?P1_Prod_Version=ShockwaveFlash and download the "tar.gz"
2007-02-10T11:10:00.000Z	Polygon89	PwcrLinux	honestly this will take 2 seconds
2007-02-10T11:10:00.000Z	Polygon89	PwcrLinux	simply download the file, and tell me when your done.
2007-02-10T11:12:00.000Z	Polygon89	PwcrLinux	yeah, did you download that file?
2007-02-10T11:13:00.000Z	PwcrLinux	Polygon89	just for tar file?
2007-02-10T11:13:00.000Z	Polygon89	PwcrLinux	yeah just the tar.gz file. download to your desktop if you can
2007-02-10T11:14:00.000Z	PwcrLinux	Polygon89	Okay file is on the desktop screen now
2007-02-10T11:15:00.000Z	Polygon89	PwcrLinux	cool. If your using gnome, you should be able to just right click the tar.gz file and select "extract here". do that now please
2007-02-10T11:15:00.000Z	PwcrLinux	Polygon89	should I close the browser before to run it?
2007-02-10T11:17:00.000Z	PwcrLinux	Polygon89	Okay the folder appeared on the desktop after extracted
2007-02-10T11:20:00.000Z	PwcrLinux	Polygon89	I am on terminal and cd'ed to Desktop and there is blue file and red file (tar.gz)
2007-02-10T11:22:00.000Z	Polygon89	PwcrLinux	if its on your desktop, typing "cd ~/Desktop/install_flash_player_9_linux" should do it
