2006-03-24T07:52:00.000Z	kingspawn	MikeMac	(a)ll files and (l)ist mode
2006-03-24T07:52:00.000Z	kingspawn	MikeMac	then I am sorry :)
2006-03-24T08:30:00.000Z	kingspawn	MikeMac	DSL is readily available these days ;)
2006-03-24T08:38:00.000Z	MikeMac	kingspawn	are you sure .bash_profile works under Ubuntu?  I didn't have any luck with 'alias PATH=PATH;/test'
2006-03-24T08:39:00.000Z	kingspawn	MikeMac	i would think _export_ is what you want
2006-03-24T08:41:00.000Z	kingspawn	MikeMac	seems that .bash_profile doesn't get sourced when you just start a normal terminal. gets sourced for regular login shells, though.
2006-03-24T08:43:00.000Z	kingspawn	MikeMac	are you talking to me now?
2006-03-24T08:49:00.000Z	kingspawn	MikeMac	may I ask why you are touching the file first? :)
2006-03-24T08:49:00.000Z	kingspawn	MikeMac	vim manages that just nicely..
2006-03-24T08:50:00.000Z	kingspawn	MikeMac	indeed. editing a file that doesnt exist creates it.
2006-03-24T08:51:00.000Z	kingspawn	MikeMac	hehe, vim is fantastic, only beaten by emacs in my eyes
2006-03-24T08:52:00.000Z	kingspawn	MikeMac	you just go ". ~/.bashrc"
2006-03-24T08:53:00.000Z	kingspawn	MikeMac	should
2006-03-24T08:54:00.000Z	kingspawn	MikeMac	what do you mean?
