2009-10-30T23:46:00.000Z	qs		hello, i've upgraded to karmic and i'm having a variety of problems with pulseaudio, perhaps someone can help?
2009-10-30T23:46:00.000Z	qs		my old setup: a laptop with intrepid and a server running jaunty
2009-10-30T23:47:00.000Z	qs		all audio was passed to the jaunty server to be played out through the speakers
2009-10-30T23:47:00.000Z	qs		it doesnt seem to be every time i play audio
2009-10-30T23:48:00.000Z	qs		definitely when i use audio from firefox/flash
2009-10-30T23:48:00.000Z	qs		other times at random it seems
2009-10-30T23:48:00.000Z	qs		also whenever i play audio, local pulseaudio uses 99% CPU
2009-10-30T23:49:00.000Z	th1	qs	don't remove pulseaudio just yet
2009-10-30T23:50:00.000Z	th1	qs	pulseaudi may need reconfiguring if you have a complex setup its changed a bit.. but still only works for some people :/
2009-10-30T23:51:00.000Z	qs	th1	i have tried the various configuration applets etc but haven't got anywhere with them - any recommendations of where to go from here?
2009-10-30T23:52:00.000Z	th1	qs	you say you are streaming audio over hte net?
2009-10-30T23:52:00.000Z	qs	th1	local network, yes
2009-10-30T23:52:00.000Z	th1	qs	you have same pulseaudio version on both ends?
2009-10-30T23:52:00.000Z	qs	th1	no but i don't think i had the same version previously
2009-10-30T23:53:00.000Z	th1	qs	but the newer version in karmic might well be incompatible with the other end
2009-10-30T23:53:00.000Z	qs	th1	hmm that's true
2009-10-30T23:53:00.000Z	qs	th1	though, it's not every case that causes problems - some are fine
2009-10-30T23:54:00.000Z	th1	qs	I'd still try with streaming to another instance of the same version and see if it helps
2009-10-30T23:54:00.000Z	qs	th1	i've tried playing from spotify (wine/alsa plugin) and it's fine; totem is fine; anything with firefox/flash just crashes pulseaudio on the other end
2009-10-30T23:54:00.000Z	th1	qs	they probably use some features that the remote end doesn't support
2009-10-30T23:54:00.000Z	th1	qs	I'd try with the same verison on the other end
2009-10-30T23:54:00.000Z	qs	th1	ok, what's the best way of going about that? are there packages for jaunty for 0.9.19?
2009-10-30T23:54:00.000Z	qs	th1	or packages for karmic for 0.9.14?
2009-10-30T23:55:00.000Z	th1	qs	I don't think so.. definitely not the 2nd one because karmic uses features that aren't in the old pulseaudio
