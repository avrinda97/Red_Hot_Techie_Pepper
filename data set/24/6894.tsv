2005-06-20T10:33:00.000Z	zero-one		I want to get permission to modify a file at /etc folder... how can i do it?
2005-06-20T10:33:00.000Z	madsen	zero-one	sudo <command to run>
2005-06-20T10:34:00.000Z	zero-one	madsen	but how can i do it using gnome, not via a term
2005-06-20T10:34:00.000Z	madsen	zero-one	Oh, hang on a sec.
2005-06-20T10:34:00.000Z	zero-one	madsen	ok
2005-06-20T10:35:00.000Z	madsen	zero-one	Applications -> System Tools -> Run as a different user...
2005-06-20T10:35:00.000Z	madsen	zero-one	Then type e.g. 'gedit' and run it as root.
2005-06-20T10:38:00.000Z	zero-one	madsen	the system says the password is wrong (but its right
2005-06-20T10:39:00.000Z	madsen	zero-one	Uh, if it contains any special chars (something not a-z 0-9) then gksu (the program asking you to give the password) might not work. :-/
2005-06-20T10:39:00.000Z	madsen	zero-one	Try opening a terminal and type 'sudo gedit' instead.
2005-06-20T10:40:00.000Z	zero-one	madsen	ok! gedit open!
2005-06-20T10:40:00.000Z	madsen	zero-one	:)
2005-06-20T10:41:00.000Z	madsen	zero-one	What file did you want to edit?
2005-06-20T10:42:00.000Z	madsen	zero-one	From the gedit with root privileges you can open/save to any file on the system, so be careful what you do.
2005-06-20T10:42:00.000Z	zero-one	madsen	ok
2005-06-20T10:42:00.000Z	madsen	zero-one	Well, if you're done editing the file, then you should just save it. (Have you saved a working backup of lilo.conf?)
2005-06-20T10:43:00.000Z	madsen	zero-one	Remember, for the changes to take effect, run 'sudo lilo' after editing lilo.conf.
2005-06-20T10:45:00.000Z	zero-one	madsen	ok... im doing what you're saying
2005-06-20T10:45:00.000Z	madsen	zero-one	:) I hope it works out well then. :)
2005-06-20T10:49:00.000Z	zero-one	madsen	iam going test it now... bye
2005-06-20T11:12:00.000Z	madsen	zero-one	Great! :)
2005-06-20T11:12:00.000Z	madsen	zero-one	Glad that it worked out well. :)
2005-06-20T11:13:00.000Z	zero-one	madsen	yes
