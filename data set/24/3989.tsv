2007-10-01T05:54:00.000Z	arooni		folks; my max resolutoin on my second monitor is 1280x1024; but with nvidia-settings; it shows my max resolution to be 640x480.... is there anyway of fixing this?  (ubuntu + feisty + nvidia graphics card 7950 gt otc)
2007-10-01T05:55:00.000Z	scguy318	arooni	perhaps you should do sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg, after you backup /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2007-10-01T05:55:00.000Z	arooni	scguy318	really/
2007-10-01T05:55:00.000Z	scguy318	arooni	yeah
2007-10-01T05:55:00.000Z	scguy318	arooni	what is your monitor? perhaps your refresh values in xorg.conf need to be adjusted
2007-10-01T05:56:00.000Z	arooni	scguy318	its a cheap one from frys.... not a brand name  ; it was wokring before i installed newer nvidia drivers (FROM .11 to .19)
2007-10-01T05:56:00.000Z	scguy318	arooni	yeah, you probably just need to adjust your horiz/vert refresh values in xorg.conf
2007-10-08T08:15:00.000Z	arooni	scguy318	so i should try typing in the IP address i see in eth0?
2007-10-08T08:12:00.000Z	scguy318	arooni	are you bridging or NATing the VM internet connection?
2007-10-08T08:12:00.000Z	arooni	scguy318	i'm not sure to be honest
2007-10-08T08:13:00.000Z	scguy318	arooni	you could just try the private IP address of the Ubuntu machine
2007-10-08T08:13:00.000Z	arooni	scguy318	where do i find that IP address?
2007-10-08T08:14:00.000Z	scguy318	arooni	ifconfig on the Ubuntu host?
2007-10-08T08:14:00.000Z	arooni	scguy318	 usser i'm using NAT for internet (and it works in terms of letting me access internet via VM)
2007-10-08T08:15:00.000Z	arooni	scguy318	i'm not sure which device i should be looking for ?  eth0
2007-10-08T08:15:00.000Z	scguy318	arooni	thats it, though
2007-10-08T08:15:00.000Z	scguy318	arooni	perhaps you'll have to specify the IP address of the gateway of the VM machine
2007-10-08T08:16:00.000Z	arooni	scguy318	how should id o that?
2007-10-08T08:16:00.000Z	scguy318	arooni	no, because you said the VM was using NAT
2007-10-08T08:16:00.000Z	scguy318	arooni	ipconfig /all in XP?
2007-10-08T08:16:00.000Z	scguy318	arooni	k go ahea and try it
2007-10-08T08:16:00.000Z	scguy318	arooni	wont hurt anything
2007-10-18T11:49:00.000Z	scguy318	arooni	try booting with all_generic_ide kernel option
2007-10-18T11:49:00.000Z	scguy318	arooni	else just install with alternate CD
