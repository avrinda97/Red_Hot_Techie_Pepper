2009-03-08T04:59:00.000Z	david_	sebsebseb	no, i mean that there is no power off in the login window
2009-03-08T04:59:00.000Z	david_	sebsebseb	but if i login into my account i can poweroff
2009-03-08T04:59:00.000Z	sebsebseb	david_	I think there is if you go to options
2009-03-08T05:00:00.000Z	david_	sebsebseb	i went to system, administration, login window and removed the "show actions" menu
2009-03-08T05:00:00.000Z	sebsebseb	david_	ok I don't know

2009-08-28T04:59:00.000Z	sebsebseb	david_	Hate Wine hmm,   why?
2009-08-28T05:00:00.000Z	david_	sebsebseb	 just a laggy program imho
2009-08-28T05:00:00.000Z	david_	sebsebseb	 bulky more to the point
2009-08-28T05:01:00.000Z	sebsebseb	david_	Wine is  a rather impressive program,  a lot of stuff  just works and works well in it these days,  quite a bit won't though,   but  all  the time and  effort  that had to be made  to make Wine,  if you had some idea about that,  you would probably know it's amzing
2009-08-28T05:01:00.000Z	sebsebseb	david_	well  not  amazing, but impressive yes
2009-08-28T05:01:00.000Z	david_	sebsebseb	Im sure your right sadly my only experience with was a few years back and it was just awfully slow
2009-08-28T05:02:00.000Z	sebsebseb	david_	well since a few years  back 1.0 come out,  and since then there have been quite  a few releases as well
2009-08-28T05:02:00.000Z	david_	sebsebseb	 but you know how it goes first bad taste and then you dont want seconds
2009-08-28T05:03:00.000Z	sebsebseb	david_	  Wine  or  Windows virtual machine, unless 3D Windows gaming or some such, but even that's getting there
2009-08-28T05:03:00.000Z	sebsebseb	david_	oh yeah and ideally people should use native Linux apps on a Linux distro of course
2009-08-28T05:03:00.000Z	david_	sebsebseb	 agreed
2010-02-01T06:44:00.000Z	sebsebseb	david_	Ubuntu?
2010-02-01T06:45:00.000Z	sebsebseb	david_	Mandriva?  http://www.distrowatch.com ?
