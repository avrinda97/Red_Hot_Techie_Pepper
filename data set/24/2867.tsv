2008-07-15T16:36:00.000Z	Lusule		still looking for help with some graphics problems :(
2008-07-15T16:36:00.000Z	bringatowel	Lusule	try to explain what the problem is
2008-07-15T16:37:00.000Z	Lusule	bringatowel	i installed the drivers for my nvidia geforce 9600, and i'm trying to use twinview, but i'm having problems with the fact that one monitor is widescreen, the other isn't
2008-07-15T16:38:00.000Z	bringatowel	Lusule	have you tried enabling restricted drivers?
2008-07-15T16:39:00.000Z	Lusule	bringatowel	i'm also having problems switching desktops
2008-07-15T16:40:00.000Z	bringatowel	Lusule	have you tried enabling restricted drivers?
2008-07-15T16:42:00.000Z	Lusule	bringatowel	- i'm using the 17.5 nvidia driver because there aren't any other drivers available for my card yet
2008-07-15T16:43:00.000Z	bringatowel	Lusule	which one is that? it is part of the restricted drivers packages?
2008-07-15T16:44:00.000Z	Lusule	bringatowel	- no, those packages don't support my card
2008-07-15T16:44:00.000Z	Lusule	bringatowel	- it's almost certainly a problem with my configuration
2008-07-15T16:46:00.000Z	bringatowel	Lusule	you might want to try installing envyng and envyng-gtk since it might find a better version of your drivers, also adds Nvidia X server settings if you dont have that already
2008-07-15T16:50:00.000Z	bringatowel	Lusule	you might want to try installing envyng and envyng-gtk since it might find a better version of your drivers, also adds Nvidia X server settings if you dont have that already
2008-07-15T16:55:00.000Z	Lusule	bringatowel	 what was that program you suggested again?
2008-07-15T16:56:00.000Z	Lusule	bringatowel	thanks
2008-07-15T17:00:00.000Z	Lusule	bringatowel	envyng doesn't work with my card :(  i seem to have fixed most of the problems now, it's just that i have to reinstall everytime i reboot
2008-07-15T17:01:00.000Z	bringatowel	Lusule	that is weird, hmm your card does not sound that old. what do you have to reinstall?
2008-07-15T17:02:00.000Z	Lusule	bringatowel	: it seems that though envyng doesn't recognise my card, i can manually choose to use it to install a driver that seems to be the same one i was installing manually
2008-07-15T17:02:00.000Z	Lusule	bringatowel	 i'm using it's install to see if it does it any better
2008-07-15T17:20:00.000Z	Lusule	bringatowel	that envyng thing worked in the end, thanks!  sorry i made it so difficult!
2008-07-15T17:21:00.000Z	bringatowel	Lusule	hehe good to hear :D
2008-07-15T17:47:00.000Z	bringatowel	Lusule	check out PyNeighborhood as well
2008-07-15T18:28:00.000Z	bringatowel	Lusule	what is the command?
2008-07-15T18:33:00.000Z	bringatowel	Lusule	gksudo gedit filename
2008-07-15T18:34:00.000Z	Lusule	bringatowel	thanks :)
