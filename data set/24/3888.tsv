2007-09-16T06:28:00.000Z	elzo		anybody know how to change ownership of files/directory of NTFS drive, without going through Windows XP?  i.e. straight from ubuntu
2007-09-16T06:29:00.000Z	scguy318	elzo	if you mean mount permissions, then yer fstab
2007-09-16T06:29:00.000Z	elzo	scguy318	nope, but i want to read some files in user directories after mounting them.
2007-09-16T06:29:00.000Z	scguy318	elzo	when you mount, everything should be accessible
2007-09-16T06:30:00.000Z	elzo	scguy318	yes everything is accessible.  but i tried to scp some data in a user directory out, and it says "permission denied"
2007-09-16T06:30:00.000Z	elzo	scguy318	other files outside user directory can be scp-ed out
2007-09-16T06:30:00.000Z	scguy318	elzo	whats the ownership for those files?
2007-09-16T06:30:00.000Z	scguy318	elzo	NTFS -> ext3 is what you are trying to do?
2007-09-16T06:31:00.000Z	elzo	scguy318	yes
2007-09-16T06:31:00.000Z	elzo	scguy318	i think they are under some non-administrative user account on winxp
2007-09-16T06:31:00.000Z	scguy318	elzo	when NTFS is mounted on Linux, root becomes the owner of all the files, unless you specify otherwise
2007-09-16T06:32:00.000Z	scguy318	elzo	so, there should be zero restrictions on copy operations on NTFS part
2007-09-16T06:32:00.000Z	scguy318	elzo	perhaps the destination is the issue?
2007-09-16T06:32:00.000Z	elzo	scguy318	that's right.  but i can access some of the root files, but not some (eventhough their file permissions are the same)
2007-09-16T06:33:00.000Z	elzo	scguy318	specifically, those under the user directories, i.e. Document and Settings/someguy/*  cannot be accessed.
2007-09-16T06:33:00.000Z	elzo	scguy318	everything else outside Document and Setting/ ../ etc can be
2007-09-16T06:33:00.000Z	scguy318	elzo	try mounting with umask=000
2007-09-16T06:33:00.000Z	elzo	scguy318	ok i'll give that a shot.
2007-09-16T06:34:00.000Z	scguy318	elzo	you could try using NTFS-3G to mount ro, i know for a fact that on Linux the NTFS ACLs are ignored
2007-09-16T06:35:00.000Z	elzo	scguy318	i hope so! :)
2007-09-16T06:36:00.000Z	elzo	scguy318	that's what i've been reading on forums, but i'm getting all these access denied.  so i'm trying knoppix now.
2007-09-16T06:36:00.000Z	scguy318	elzo	are you sure the destination isn't the issue?
2007-09-16T06:36:00.000Z	elzo	scguy318	yup, because i copied some other files from other non-restricted directories, and those worked fine.
2007-09-16T06:37:00.000Z	scguy318	elzo	i guess try ntfs-3g, weird
