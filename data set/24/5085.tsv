2006-11-03T14:45:00.000Z	sidewalk		im having problem with  in default ubuntu-installation
2006-11-03T14:45:00.000Z	sidewalk		how do i get this working?
2006-11-03T14:45:00.000Z	LjL	sidewalk	in KDE i have a "keyboard layout" control panel applet. i'm sure Gnome has the same
2008-11-16T19:01:00.000Z	LjL	sidewalk	uhm, it's an analog tv card i assume?
2008-11-16T19:01:00.000Z	sidewalk	LjL	yes, analog tv card
2008-11-16T19:02:00.000Z	LjL	sidewalk	usb or internal?
2008-11-16T19:02:00.000Z	sidewalk	LjL	i think its pci or something
2008-11-16T19:03:00.000Z	LjL	sidewalk	the problem with those card is that they *usually* simply ask for a screen overlay on your video card - basically, a "picture in picture" system, where the OS isn't really handling the TV display, it doesn't even know what pixels are being shown (and if you take a screenshot, the TV window comes out blank - try that)
2008-11-16T19:03:00.000Z	LjL	sidewalk	so it might not be trivial to stream the contents
2008-11-16T19:04:00.000Z	sidewalk	LjL	oh, but i can start ktv locally, i have vnc access to the machine
2008-11-16T19:04:00.000Z	LjL	sidewalk	yes but try doing this, start ktv, then take a screenshot
2008-11-16T19:05:00.000Z	sidewalk	LjL	dont have the cable connected atm, will have to get back to you on that one
2008-11-16T19:05:00.000Z	sidewalk	LjL	but what do you recommend in the future?
2008-11-16T19:05:00.000Z	sidewalk	LjL	what shoutcast service? :D
2008-11-16T19:06:00.000Z	LjL	sidewalk	i don't recommend anything, i actually think you'll be lucky if you get *anything* to work for streaming. but i'd try mplayer (possibly with the KMplayer interface)
2008-11-16T19:06:00.000Z	sidewalk	LjL	great, thanks!
2009-03-07T05:22:00.000Z	LjL	sidewalk	i don't know about network-manager, but i know how to do it manually from /etc/network/interfaces (except then n-m might interfere with that)
2009-03-07T05:23:00.000Z	sidewalk	LjL	would like to know how to setup a WPA PSK2 wifi ad-hoc network between two machines, cant get it working with the network manager
2009-03-07T05:23:00.000Z	LjL	sidewalk	i can tell you how to do the ad-hoc part, don't remember about using WPA
2009-03-07T05:23:00.000Z	sidewalk	LjL	wep is too weak
2009-03-07T05:24:00.000Z	LjL	sidewalk	well then look up how to do WPA inside /e/n/i. i'm sure there's plenty of articles about that.
2009-03-08T05:21:00.000Z	LjL	sidewalk	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Adhoc
2009-03-08T05:21:00.000Z	LjL	sidewalk	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs for the non-ad-hoc-specific instructions including WPA usage
2011-04-05T16:41:00.000Z	LjL	sidewalk	kannel and smstools are the only two i can see
