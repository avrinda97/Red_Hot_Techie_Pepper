2007-04-04T07:19:00.000Z	xjkx		how does ubuntu do to make fluxbox add menus automatically when softwares are installed?
2007-04-04T07:19:00.000Z	bruenig	xjkx	are you saying it does or doesn't?
2007-04-04T07:19:00.000Z	xjkx	bruenig	i am saying it does, and i wanna know how
2007-04-04T07:20:00.000Z	bruenig	xjkx	well, fluxbox is different right, it has a text file that defines its menus right?
2007-04-04T07:20:00.000Z	xjkx	bruenig	right
2007-04-04T07:20:00.000Z	bruenig	xjkx	I know in gnome and kde it puts a .desktop file in /usr/share/applications, perhaps it has something in its fluxbox package to make that work
2007-04-04T07:22:00.000Z	bruenig	xjkx	well if i interpreted price child correctly, it uses the .desktop method, so dpkg puts a .desktop file in /usr/share/applications on install
2007-04-04T07:22:00.000Z	xjkx	bruenig	fluxbox doesnt read /usr/share/applications
2007-04-04T07:23:00.000Z	bruenig	xjkx	have PriceChild explain himself

2007-07-01T09:06:00.000Z	bruenig	xjkx	gmplayer is just a symlink to mplayer
2007-07-01T09:06:00.000Z	bruenig	xjkx	install mplayer
2007-07-01T09:09:00.000Z	bruenig	xjkx	gmplayer is not an application, mplayer is
2007-07-01T09:10:00.000Z	bruenig	xjkx	gmplayer is a file that ships with mplayer and is merely a symlink to mplayer which tells mplayer to launch with a skin
2007-07-01T09:10:00.000Z	xjkx	bruenig	but i cant use equalizer on mplayer :< whats the hotkey then?
2007-07-01T09:10:00.000Z	bruenig	xjkx	run gmplayer
2007-07-01T09:10:00.000Z	xjkx	bruenig	it gives me erros, mplayer runs fine, strange
