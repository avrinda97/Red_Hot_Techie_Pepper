2009-09-09T00:19:00.000Z	pranav	trism	you mean after typing screen in the console
2009-09-09T00:21:00.000Z	pranav	trism	The bot says its window manager for terminal season, should I get it for the base system for copying and pasting /
2009-09-09T00:23:00.000Z	trism	pranav	it is very useful when you only have the command line to work with, might want to give it a try, since you seem to be only using a terminal
2009-09-09T00:23:00.000Z	trism	pranav	I mostly suggested it because it gives you a way to copy and paste between applications without being in an x session
2009-09-09T00:25:00.000Z	pranav	trism	yes I am istalling it
2009-09-09T00:36:00.000Z	pranav	trism	So I wrote "sudo screen nano /mnt/C/test.txt" but even I press F7, I cant use the hjkl keys to navigate and space to copy, is there sth wrong in this process ?
2009-09-09T00:37:00.000Z	trism	pranav	you want to start screen first
2009-09-09T00:37:00.000Z	trism	pranav	just type screen
2009-09-09T00:38:00.000Z	pranav	trism	typed it cleared the screen
2009-09-09T00:38:00.000Z	pranav	trism	should I load the file using nano now ?
2009-09-09T00:38:00.000Z	trism	pranav	yep
2009-09-09T00:39:00.000Z	pranav	trism	loaded
2009-09-09T00:39:00.000Z	pranav	trism	but even I press F7, the cursors don't move with hjkl ?
2009-09-09T00:40:00.000Z	trism	pranav	try ctrl+a ESC
2009-09-09T00:40:00.000Z	trism	pranav	ubuntu screen-profiles remaps it to f7 since copy/paste is fairly common
2009-09-09T00:41:00.000Z	trism	pranav	but you might have to install that separately I forget
2009-09-09T00:41:00.000Z	pranav	trism	I copied but cant paste ?
2009-09-09T00:41:00.000Z	trism	pranav	you paste it with ctrl+a ]
2009-09-09T00:42:00.000Z	pranav	trism	you mean "]" together ?
2009-09-09T00:42:00.000Z	trism	pranav	ctrl+a and then hit ]
2009-09-09T00:42:00.000Z	pranav	trism	Thanks so much !
2009-09-09T00:43:00.000Z	trism	pranav	np, glad I could help
2009-09-15T00:38:00.000Z	trism	pranav	I would just rip out the hard drive, put it in an encloser and install to that
