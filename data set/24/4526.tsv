2008-01-04T02:01:00.000Z	jeff__		Hey can someone bail me out? I did a fresh install of Gutsy and got all the custom visual effects working but then I did the updates and that broke something. I now can'
2008-01-04T02:01:00.000Z	PurpZeY	jeff__	updates?
2008-01-04T02:02:00.000Z	jeff__	PurpZeY	Yes, sorry. The updates broke something. I noticed one of them was compiz after I started the process
2008-01-04T02:02:00.000Z	PurpZeY	jeff__	It's possible one of the newer updates messed your video cards settings....
2008-01-04T02:03:00.000Z	jeff__	PurpZeY	Everything looks OK still. Anything in particular to check?
2008-01-04T02:04:00.000Z	PurpZeY	jeff__	Well, what, itsn't working?
2008-01-04T02:06:00.000Z	jeff__	PurpZeY	I had all the custom visual effects working but the update broke that. I've been reset to None in Appearances. If I try to enable I get "Desktop effects could not be enabled"
2008-01-04T02:07:00.000Z	PurpZeY	jeff__	What kind of video card?
2008-01-04T02:07:00.000Z	jeff__	PurpZeY	ATI Radeon X1150.
2008-01-04T02:07:00.000Z	PurpZeY	jeff__	xgl installed?
2008-01-04T02:09:00.000Z	jeff__	PurpZeY	no xgl. I had too many problems with that on another laptop. Literally a clean install of Gutsy followed by ATI (via Envy f it matters)
2008-01-04T02:10:00.000Z	PurpZeY	jeff__	Use restricted drivers manager...do reconfigure if you have to...envy causes problems
2008-01-04T02:10:00.000Z	jeff__	PurpZeY	I was afraid you'd say that. OK.
2008-01-04T02:11:00.000Z	PurpZeY	jeff__	Envy not supported or recommended around here. This is exactly why.
2008-01-04T02:12:00.000Z	jeff__	PurpZeY	Is a direct install from ATI's downloaded driver worse?
2008-01-04T02:12:00.000Z	PurpZeY	jeff__	Use the restricted drivers manager, that's why it's there
2008-01-04T02:13:00.000Z	jeff__	PurpZeY	My understanding is that the restricted driver is old, doesn't support AIGLX and generally doesn't handle compiz 3d effects as well
2008-01-04T02:14:00.000Z	PurpZeY	jeff__	That might be....#compiz-fusion is the best place to ask about that, but definitely don't use envy.....And the RESTRICTED DRIVER manager, is not inherently the same as the driver itself.
2008-01-04T02:15:00.000Z	jeff__	PurpZeY	Sorry can you clarify the difference between the restricted driver manager and the driver itself for me please?
2008-01-04T02:15:00.000Z	PurpZeY	jeff__	As I understand it, the manager isn't tied to those drivers
2008-01-04T02:16:00.000Z	PurpZeY	jeff__	And I could be wrong, it'd be the 3rd time in 2 days I was wrong....Ask in #compiz-fusion to make sure you get it tip-top
2008-01-04T02:18:00.000Z	jeff__	PurpZeY	 Thanks for the help. As I said to crdlb I'm off to reboot
2008-01-08T10:28:00.000Z	PurpZeY	jeff__	System --> Adm --> Restricted Drivers Manager
2008-01-08T10:29:00.000Z	PurpZeY	jeff__	I don't know how to get to it necessarily in kde but it's the restricted drivers manager
