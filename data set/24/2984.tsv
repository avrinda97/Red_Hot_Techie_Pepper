2008-09-05T01:47:00.000Z	mysterycool		What is that program which is similar to Cairo-dock and allows me to have some kind of luncher just like in Mac OS X at the bottom?
2008-09-05T01:49:00.000Z	mysterycool		!cairo-dock
2008-09-05T01:49:00.000Z	mysterycool		!dock
2008-09-05T01:49:00.000Z	mysterycool		!mac osx -like dock

2008-09-05T01:54:00.000Z	unavailable	mysterycool	whats wrong with cairo-dock
2008-09-05T01:54:00.000Z	unavailable	mysterycool	 cairo-dock is faster than awn
2008-09-05T01:54:00.000Z	mysterycool	unavailable	Well, I've got a lame graphics card and at all the docs, there is an annoying black background behind it like a rectangle
2008-09-05T01:55:00.000Z	mysterycool	unavailable	Do you know a way to get rid of that stupid black rectangle? :S
2008-09-05T01:55:00.000Z	unavailable	mysterycool	 and youve tried the background tab?
2008-09-05T01:55:00.000Z	mysterycool	unavailable	Yes, it does not work :S
2008-09-05T01:56:00.000Z	unavailable	mysterycool	 try making a transparent image in gimp
2008-09-05T01:57:00.000Z	mysterycool	unavailable	Yes, then what?
2008-09-05T01:57:00.000Z	unavailable	mysterycool	 and make that as your background image
2008-09-05T01:57:00.000Z	mysterycool	unavailable	Ok, about how big? Like, 1x1?
2008-09-05T01:58:00.000Z	unavailable	mysterycool	 shouldnt make a difference, it should stretch it
2008-09-05T02:00:00.000Z	mysterycool	unavailable	It does not work :/
2008-09-05T02:01:00.000Z	mysterycool	unavailable	The background image is for the dock, there is nothing for that extra black thing! :S
2008-09-05T02:03:00.000Z	unavailable	mysterycool	 but there is AWN, http://www.kiba-dock.org/  but for kiba dock you need compiz, i dunno about awn
2008-09-05T02:04:00.000Z	mysterycool	unavailable	graphics card too lame to hold compiz :/
