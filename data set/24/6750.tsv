2006-04-27T05:04:00.000Z	Arafangion	stjepan	Probably means you do not have hardware accelerated graphics.
2006-04-27T05:04:00.000Z	Arafangion	stjepan	Give the commercial drivers a go.
2006-04-27T05:05:00.000Z	Arafangion	stjepan	Any particular reason?
2006-04-27T05:05:00.000Z	stjepan	Arafangion	for what?
2006-04-27T05:06:00.000Z	Arafangion	stjepan	Are you using the free drivers, or the ATI drivers?
2006-04-27T05:06:00.000Z	Arafangion	stjepan	Give the free version a go, then.
2006-04-27T05:07:00.000Z	Arafangion	stjepan	Nice :)
2006-04-27T05:08:00.000Z	Arafangion	stjepan	If it's a laptop, I would check to see if standby and hibernation work.
2006-04-27T05:08:00.000Z	Arafangion	stjepan	Give the free version a go, then.
2006-04-27T05:08:00.000Z	stjepan	Arafangion	it's not a laptop
2006-04-27T05:09:00.000Z	Arafangion	stjepan	Well, give the ATI version a go, then.
2006-04-27T05:09:00.000Z	stjepan	Arafangion	opensource drivers don't work very well
2006-04-27T05:09:00.000Z	Arafangion	stjepan	I've heard that they sometimes work better than the ATI drivers.
2006-04-27T05:09:00.000Z	Arafangion	stjepan	Pretty much touch and go which one is better on ati cards.
2006-04-27T05:10:00.000Z	stjepan	Arafangion	I want 3D acceleration
2006-04-27T05:10:00.000Z	Arafangion	stjepan	afaik, it does have 3D acceleration.
2006-04-27T05:11:00.000Z	Arafangion	stjepan	Just not as good as ATI's version.
2006-04-27T05:11:00.000Z	Arafangion	stjepan	It's the free nvidia drivers that don't have 3d acceleration at all.
2006-04-27T05:14:00.000Z	stjepan	Arafangion	the only opensource ati drivers which provide 3d acceleration are the cvs ones
2006-04-27T05:14:00.000Z	Arafangion	stjepan	Interesting.
2006-04-27T05:15:00.000Z	stjepan	Arafangion	I meant for my card
2006-04-27T05:15:00.000Z	Arafangion	stjepan	I see.
