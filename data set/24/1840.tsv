2011-03-10T10:16:00.000Z	LorgonJortle		Does anyone know of a JWPlayer channel, or a place I can get help with it?
2011-03-10T10:16:00.000Z	aaron11	LorgonJortle	try #jwplayer
2011-03-10T10:17:00.000Z	LorgonJortle	aaron11	Aye. I did, but there's nobody in there.
2011-03-10T10:17:00.000Z	aaron11	LorgonJortle	Then ask your question here
2011-03-10T10:18:00.000Z	LorgonJortle	aaron11	Alright. Thanks.
2011-03-10T10:26:00.000Z	LorgonJortle	aaron11	Do you know of a way to make JWPlayer work in the other browsers with my OGV file?
2011-03-10T10:26:00.000Z	aaron11	LorgonJortle	No, wth is JWPlayer?
2011-03-10T10:27:00.000Z	LorgonJortle	aaron11	Do you have an alternative suggestion for a player?
2011-03-10T10:27:00.000Z	aaron11	LorgonJortle	VLC?
2011-03-10T10:27:00.000Z	LorgonJortle	aaron11	So, after installing VLC, I'd just navigate to the location of the video file on the website and it'll play it?
2011-03-10T10:28:00.000Z	aaron11	LorgonJortle	I think, I dont know much about that.
2011-03-10T10:29:00.000Z	LorgonJortle	aaron11	Hmm. I just tried that, and all it did was download it, not play it. Thanks for the help anyway though. :)
2011-03-10T10:29:00.000Z	aaron11	LorgonJortle	k.
2011-03-10T10:32:00.000Z	aaron11	LorgonJortle	You want to play that video?
2011-03-10T10:32:00.000Z	LorgonJortle	aaron11	I'd like it to play in other browsers, yes. It works fine for me in Chromium, but fails for all others, it seems.
2011-03-10T10:33:00.000Z	aaron11	LorgonJortle	I think its related to browser plugins.
2011-03-10T10:35:00.000Z	aaron11	LorgonJortle	Ummm... there was a website that allows long videos. I just dont remember it.
2011-03-10T10:36:00.000Z	LorgonJortle	aaron11	The problem with putting it onto a hosting site is that it'll like have to be converted to FLV... and I don't want to lose much quality, since it has a lot of text people have to read and it blurs easily with a format conversion.
2011-03-10T10:37:00.000Z	aaron11	LorgonJortle	Did you make that video?
2011-03-10T10:37:00.000Z	LorgonJortle	aaron11	It's my video, yes.
2011-03-10T10:37:00.000Z	aaron11	LorgonJortle	It works ok on opera
2011-03-10T10:39:00.000Z	LorgonJortle	aaron11	Any luck with fF?
2011-03-10T10:40:00.000Z	aaron11	LorgonJortle	It doesnt support ogv.
2011-03-10T10:40:00.000Z	LorgonJortle	aaron11	Firefox, or JWPlayer?
