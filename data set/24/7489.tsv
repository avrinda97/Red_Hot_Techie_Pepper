2005-05-29T11:51:00.000Z	delire	mpq	did you fillow nickrud's suggestion?
2005-05-29T11:53:00.000Z	delire	mpq	there are tools for tweaking the way the mouse performs.
2005-05-29T12:17:00.000Z	delire	mpq	is it a synaptic touchpad?
2005-05-29T12:17:00.000Z	delire	mpq	what is the laptop?
2005-05-29T12:18:00.000Z	delire	mpq	 i would 'apt-get install qsynaptics'
2005-05-29T12:18:00.000Z	delire	mpq	i think your hp touchpad uses a 'synaptic' touchpad
2005-05-29T12:19:00.000Z	delire	mpq	why not?
2005-05-29T12:20:00.000Z	delire	mpq	ahah, it doesn't support xorg. sorry. that's a no go. are you using gnome?
2005-05-29T12:21:00.000Z	delire	mpq	i would talk to anto9us about this. i use a synaptic touchpad on a debian, not ubuntu laptop.
2005-05-29T12:29:00.000Z	delire	mpq	see google.com/linux. search for your hp laptop +mouse speed. i can guarantee someone else out there has had the same issue
2005-05-29T12:33:00.000Z	delire	mpq	anto9us tells me that the package is  xorg-driver-synaptics
2005-05-29T12:34:00.000Z	delire	mpq	and you can't now install qsynaptics?
2005-05-29T12:40:00.000Z	delire	mpq	works?
2005-05-29T12:41:00.000Z	delire	mpq	hehe
2005-05-29T12:41:00.000Z	delire	mpq	well tweak some more.
2005-05-29T12:42:00.000Z	delire	mpq	CTRL-ALT-BCKSPC
2005-05-29T12:46:00.000Z	delire	mpq	i would google.com/linux for your laptop +touchpad
2005-05-29T12:46:00.000Z	delire	mpq	it did, just the session manager picked X up again.
