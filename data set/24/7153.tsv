2005-04-12T16:17:00.000Z	burgermann		Is Synaptic capable of installing downloaded packages at all? or is it just for upgrading the existing one and so?
2005-04-12T16:18:00.000Z	burgermann		how odd, there's no "Add packages" button =(
2005-04-12T16:20:00.000Z	burgermann		Arhh oki
2005-04-12T16:21:00.000Z	Arnia	burgermann	Synaptic installs software quite nicely :)
2005-04-12T16:25:00.000Z	Arnia	burgermann	I'm curious... how are you there?
2005-04-12T16:25:00.000Z	burgermann	Arnia	hehe good question.. someone said something about install using the command-line..
2005-04-12T16:26:00.000Z	Arnia	burgermann	You using Gnome?
2005-04-12T16:26:00.000Z	burgermann	Arnia	ye =D
2005-04-12T16:27:00.000Z	burgermann	Arnia	ay! then I've opened it then what? =D
2005-04-12T16:29:00.000Z	burgermann	Arnia	it doesn't find it. I'm trying to install OpenOffice 2.0 Beta
2005-04-12T16:31:00.000Z	Arnia	burgermann	No... it will search the package index
2005-04-12T16:31:00.000Z	Arnia	burgermann	Which is the index of stuff it can download
2005-04-12T16:31:00.000Z	Arnia	burgermann	Search for openoffice by name and description
2005-04-12T16:31:00.000Z	burgermann	Arnia	did the search, but it only finds the old 1.1.3 openoffice :/
2005-04-12T16:37:00.000Z	Arnia	burgermann	You don't need to manually download most things
2005-04-12T16:38:00.000Z	Arnia	burgermann	The Apt system will handle it for you
2005-04-12T16:38:00.000Z	Arnia	burgermann	Synaptic is an Apt client
2005-04-12T16:38:00.000Z	Arnia	burgermann	Go into Settings > Repositories
2005-04-12T16:40:00.000Z	Arnia	burgermann	Click ok and then ok again
2005-04-12T16:41:00.000Z	Arnia	burgermann	It will ask you if you want to update your package lists. Say yes
2005-04-12T16:41:00.000Z	Arnia	burgermann	Once its done updating, search for openoffice by name and description again
2005-04-12T16:42:00.000Z	burgermann	Arnia	thx.. :P
2005-04-12T16:44:00.000Z	Arnia	burgermann	no problem
