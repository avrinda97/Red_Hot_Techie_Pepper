2008-04-29T23:04:00.000Z	OllieA		When I boot up Hardy, instead of displaying a loading screen the monitor just goes blank, but about 1min later (after loading, i presume) it flicks back on and it is fine. How can I make the loading screen display?
2008-04-29T23:04:00.000Z	katakaio	OllieA	I guess I'd have the same recommendation - you can check your /boot/grub/menu.lst file to see if the splash is disabled
2008-04-29T23:05:00.000Z	OllieA	katakaio	Thanks, will do :)
2008-04-29T23:06:00.000Z	katakaio	OllieA	No problem. I'd check to make sure you don't have "nosplash" or "noquiet" in your menu.lst file
2008-04-29T23:06:00.000Z	OllieA	katakaio	How, lol, Doesn't appear
2008-04-29T23:06:00.000Z	katakaio	OllieA	What doesn't appear?
2008-04-29T23:07:00.000Z	OllieA	katakaio	From simplynam, not me :P
2008-04-29T23:07:00.000Z	OllieA	katakaio	Oh my bad
2008-04-29T23:07:00.000Z	OllieA	katakaio	Was from me :P
2008-04-29T23:07:00.000Z	OllieA	katakaio	Can't find /boot/grub/
2008-04-29T23:07:00.000Z	OllieA	katakaio	I'm in /boot
2008-04-29T23:08:00.000Z	katakaio	OllieA	It's probably hidden. Go to the terminal and type "sudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst"
2008-04-29T23:09:00.000Z	OllieA	katakaio	It just created a blank document
2008-04-29T23:09:00.000Z	katakaio	OllieA	Whoa, well that might be your problem there
2008-04-29T23:09:00.000Z	OllieA	katakaio	Lol, what do I type?
2008-04-29T23:09:00.000Z	katakaio	OllieA	You said that you're running Hardy?
2008-04-29T23:10:00.000Z	OllieA	katakaio	Yeah, but was an Alternate install for PPC
2008-04-29T23:11:00.000Z	katakaio	OllieA	OK, you're going to need to get a menu.lst file from a PPC user that you can use
2008-04-29T23:11:00.000Z	OllieA	katakaio	Any ideas on obtaining?
2008-04-29T23:14:00.000Z	OllieA	katakaio	Gonna do a Filesystem search for the grub folder
2008-04-29T23:15:00.000Z	katakaio	OllieA	Have you tried showing hidden files?
2008-04-29T23:15:00.000Z	OllieA	katakaio	Yep
2008-04-29T23:16:00.000Z	katakaio	OllieA	I'm afraid you're out of my league - I've never done an alternate PPC install
2008-04-29T23:16:00.000Z	OllieA	katakaio	Thaks anyway
