2006-11-13T16:22:00.000Z	neobyte420		i was hoping that yahelite running the yahvox through wine on my ubuntu would help

2006-11-13T16:23:00.000Z	neobyte420		on another note...where should i begin if i want to become great at linux?
2006-11-13T16:24:00.000Z	stefan	neobyte420	build your own Kernel
2006-11-13T16:25:00.000Z	stefan	neobyte420	and have you done it?
2006-11-13T16:26:00.000Z	neobyte420	stefan	no i dont know where to begin
2006-11-13T16:27:00.000Z	stefan	neobyte420	download the Kernel source
2006-11-13T16:27:00.000Z	stefan	neobyte420	from kernel.org for example
2006-11-13T16:28:00.000Z	stefan	neobyte420	there are many goog docs out there
2006-11-13T16:30:00.000Z	stefan	neobyte420	just google a manual on how to build your kernel
2006-11-13T16:31:00.000Z	stefan	neobyte420	it`s not that complicated though
2006-11-13T16:31:00.000Z	neobyte420	stefan	it looks cool
2006-11-13T16:31:00.000Z	stefan	neobyte420	there are even grafical interfaces to configure it
2006-11-13T16:33:00.000Z	stefan	neobyte420	Gentoo is nice though
2006-11-13T16:33:00.000Z	stefan	neobyte420	slim and clean...
2006-11-13T16:35:00.000Z	stefan	neobyte420	the emerge command is as easy to use
2006-11-13T16:37:00.000Z	stefan	neobyte420	not really
2006-11-13T16:37:00.000Z	neobyte420	stefan	no not really i dont need a firewall?
2006-11-13T16:37:00.000Z	stefan	neobyte420	just use secure software
