2006-03-07T12:04:00.000Z	ssstormy	Wammy	you have a default kernel?
2006-03-07T12:04:00.000Z	Wammy	ssstormy	yeah, is that the problem?
2006-03-07T12:04:00.000Z	ssstormy	Wammy	no.  that's good

2006-03-07T12:05:00.000Z	ssstormy	Wammy	try running /etc/init.d/alsa-utils restart
2006-03-07T12:09:00.000Z	Wammy	ssstormy	dont know if this has anything to do, but the hotplug subsystem errors out on boot. says permision denied on modprobe
2006-03-07T12:10:00.000Z	ssstormy	Wammy	good god the last time that kinda error came to me, the whole system wouldn't load
2006-03-07T12:10:00.000Z	ssstormy	Wammy	what's your card again?
2006-03-07T12:13:00.000Z	ssstormy	Wammy	there is indeed a NeoMagic driver in the kernel
2006-03-07T12:13:00.000Z	ssstormy	Wammy	you could try building your own kernel
2006-03-07T12:13:00.000Z	Wammy	ssstormy	alsa says: alsactl: load_state:1134 no soundcards found
2006-03-07T12:13:00.000Z	Wammy	ssstormy	heh id like to not go through that trouble atm :/

2006-03-07T12:15:00.000Z	ssstormy	Wammy	you could try modprobe -v *
2006-03-07T12:15:00.000Z	ssstormy	Wammy	ah yes that's better, modprobe -v snd-*
2006-03-07T12:15:00.000Z	ssstormy	Wammy	I looked and didn't find any neomagic modules except video
