2009-02-24T09:25:00.000Z	mankash	crdlb	what is linux-backports-modules-intrepid?
2009-02-24T09:26:00.000Z	crdlb	mankash	it contains the ath5k kernel module for atheros wifi
2009-02-24T09:26:00.000Z	crdlb	mankash	which is better than the madwifi (ath_pci) that intrepid ships
2009-02-24T09:27:00.000Z	mankash	crdlb	you mean it is another driver for atheros card
2009-02-24T09:28:00.000Z	crdlb	mankash	yes, another driver; it will replace madwifi eventually
2009-02-24T09:29:00.000Z	mankash	crdlb	I am also using some drive for my atheros card. How to find which one I am using?
2009-02-24T09:29:00.000Z	crdlb	mankash	lsmod | grep ath
2009-02-24T09:29:00.000Z	crdlb	mankash	ath_pci is madwifi, ath5k is ath5k (obviously :>)
2009-02-24T09:31:00.000Z	crdlb	mankash	what atheros chip is it?
2009-02-24T09:31:00.000Z	crdlb	mankash	same here, I switched to ath5k because it seems to support WPA much better
2009-02-24T09:32:00.000Z	crdlb	mankash	not to mention it's completely open source unlike madwifi (ath_hal is closed source)
2009-02-24T09:37:00.000Z	crdlb	mankash	part of it is, which is why it's in the restricted driver manager
2009-02-24T09:39:00.000Z	crdlb	mankash	with madwifi? I'm not using that anymore
2009-02-24T09:40:00.000Z	crdlb	mankash	install linux-backports-modules-intrepid, switch the driver in hardware drivers, reboot
2009-02-24T09:42:00.000Z	crdlb	mankash	yes, if you're using intrepid
2009-02-24T09:43:00.000Z	mankash	crdlb	Hakume has drifferent atheros chipset other then AR5212
2009-02-24T09:43:00.000Z	crdlb	mankash	yes, but it works with ath5k
2009-02-24T09:52:00.000Z	mankash	crdlb	 how to change the driver to interprid?
2009-02-24T09:54:00.000Z	crdlb	mankash	just switch to the other choice in hardware drivers
2009-02-24T09:58:00.000Z	mankash	crdlb	I am getting this error: Couldn't find package linux-backports-modules-intrepid
2009-02-24T10:01:00.000Z	crdlb	mankash	are you sure you're on intrepid (8.10)?
2009-02-24T10:03:00.000Z	mankash	crdlb	I am on 8.04
2009-02-24T10:03:00.000Z	crdlb	mankash	that would be why then :)
2009-02-24T10:04:00.000Z	crdlb	mankash	if you want to, yes; it's not a long-term support release like 8.04 is though
