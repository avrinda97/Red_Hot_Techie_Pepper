2007-07-25T12:22:00.000Z	GuitarInc1		I'm a complete n00b
2007-07-25T12:22:00.000Z	RickH	GuitarInc1	 We have T-Shirts... They're $12 each.... want three? :)
2007-07-25T12:22:00.000Z	RickH	GuitarInc1	 We have T-Shirts... :)
2007-07-25T12:24:00.000Z	RickH	GuitarInc1	Nope... just being sily. :)
2007-07-25T12:26:00.000Z	RickH	GuitarInc1	And then type "exit"
2007-07-25T12:31:00.000Z	RickH	GuitarInc1	 Generally speaking, leave everything as it is.
2007-07-25T12:31:00.000Z	RickH	GuitarInc1	 The only problem you're having is video modes, right?
2007-07-25T12:32:00.000Z	RickH	GuitarInc1	 If you go to the end of that process, you'll see the part about configuring your monitor.
2007-07-25T12:32:00.000Z	RickH	GuitarInc1	 That's where you'll set it up.
2007-07-25T12:35:00.000Z	RickH	GuitarInc1	 You could save yourself some trouble by downloading the newest driver from nvidia.
2007-07-25T12:35:00.000Z	RickH	GuitarInc1	It would install itself properly.
2007-07-25T12:44:00.000Z	RickH	GuitarInc1	DMI = Direct Memory Interface.  Something happened which ran out of memory.
2007-07-25T12:46:00.000Z	RickH	GuitarInc1	 There is a solution to your problem.
2007-07-25T12:46:00.000Z	RickH	GuitarInc1	Get the latest Nvidia driver and run it.
2007-07-25T12:46:00.000Z	RickH	GuitarInc1	You will have to install some packages, but it tells you what you don't have.
2007-07-25T12:47:00.000Z	RickH	GuitarInc1	Also, try googling "ubuntu nvidia install" and then your model number.
2007-07-25T12:47:00.000Z	RickH	GuitarInc1	If that didn't fix it, then try the Nvidia driver from www.nvidia.com
2007-07-25T12:48:00.000Z	RickH	GuitarInc1	I had difficulties with my nvidia card.  Once I got the proper libraries installed to compile the driver at install time, and downloaded the Nvidia one from their website, it worked beautifully.
2007-07-25T12:48:00.000Z	RickH	GuitarInc1	The only manual thing I had to do was add a line in my config file for rotation.
2007-07-25T12:48:00.000Z	RickH	GuitarInc1	I run my monitor in 90 degree counter-clockwise mode at 1200 x 1920.
2007-07-25T12:50:00.000Z	RickH	GuitarInc1	"sudo apt-get install whatever"
2007-07-25T12:50:00.000Z	RickH	GuitarInc1	It will tell you the names of what's missing.
2007-07-25T12:52:00.000Z	RickH	GuitarInc1	sudo would not be necessary.
