2011-05-26T10:07:00.000Z	dr_Willis		check your squid logs perhaps?
2011-05-26T10:09:00.000Z	john_rambo	dr_Willis	Am I suppose to ask Ubuntu or at least the browser to use proxy ?
2011-05-26T10:09:00.000Z	dr_Willis	john_rambo	 you configure the browser to use the squid prox
2011-05-26T10:09:00.000Z	john_rambo	dr_Willis	How exactly ? ...I havent done this before
2011-05-26T10:10:00.000Z	dr_Willis	john_rambo	 the squid docs tell you the defalt port to use.
2011-05-26T10:17:00.000Z	john_rambo	dr_Willis	Okay I know the pot now ....At FF select Manual Proxy settings ...then ? http proxy? & use http://127.0.0.1 ??
2011-05-26T10:18:00.000Z	john_rambo	dr_Willis	port*
2011-05-26T10:18:00.000Z	dr_Willis	john_rambo	 i would check the squid docs.. its  not too hard to confiure. ip# and port.
2011-05-26T10:19:00.000Z	dr_Willis		thers proberly firefox extensoons to enable/disable squid
2011-05-26T10:19:00.000Z	john_rambo	dr_Willis	Please
2011-05-26T10:19:00.000Z	dr_Willis		please what? you want me to read the squid docs to you? Im no teven on a pc right now.]
2011-05-26T10:21:00.000Z	dr_Willis		vustom it works. :) its weird.. and not oficially supported here.
2011-05-26T10:22:00.000Z	dr_Willis		Joilcould is now known as Joli OS - based on  one of the older releases of ubuntu.
2011-05-26T10:24:00.000Z	dr_Willis		vustom i found Jolios support rather lacking... either it works.. or  it dosent it seems
2011-05-26T10:24:00.000Z	dr_Willis		vustom  unplug/plug in the keyboard. or try a ps2 keyboard perhaps
2011-05-26T10:25:00.000Z	dr_Willis		I dident find JoliOS  that impressive.. and lacking in ways.  its hard for them to 'support' all the 'old' pc's they are trying to target.
2011-05-26T10:25:00.000Z	dr_Willis		PS2 or USB.. round plug .. :) old skool
2011-05-26T10:26:00.000Z	dr_Willis		I have seen pc;s that grub dont work right with.. when using a USB keyboard
2011-05-26T10:27:00.000Z	dr_Willis		vustom you could make a live flash drivce.. and do some changes
2011-05-26T10:28:00.000Z	dr_Willis		vustom remasering the iso is not trivial. and you dont even know what you want to change do you? easiest way is to make a bootable flash drive.
2011-05-26T10:29:00.000Z	dr_Willis		vustom - the proram unetbootin was mentioned earlier
2011-05-26T10:30:00.000Z	dr_Willis		the Pendrivelinux web site - also has  alternatives to Unetbootin
2011-05-26T10:34:00.000Z	john_rambo	dr_Willis	Its working !!!!!
2011-05-26T10:35:00.000Z	john_rambo	dr_Willis	Now how do I apply it system wide ? Using Xubuntu 10.04
