2009-11-07T05:01:00.000Z	Ruge		huaanito: thanks! still think its crazy that I have to do all this..
2009-11-07T05:03:00.000Z	Ruge		Ill see if anyone posts on the forum thread I made.... a fresh install should at least let me boot! *sigh*
2009-11-07T05:04:00.000Z	lockd	Ruge	there was an upgrade to the new GRUB2
2009-11-07T05:04:00.000Z	Ruge	lockd	you think GRUB2 upgrade didnt work?
2009-11-07T05:04:00.000Z	Ruge	lockd	Cuz ive installed Ubuntu twice and get same error :(
2009-11-07T05:05:00.000Z	lockd	Ruge	err, if it's a fresh install, you didn't upgrade. But Grub2 has been quite unstable for me
2009-11-07T05:05:00.000Z	Ruge	lockd	yeah fresh install, wiped my drives and started from scratch. but now my machine is rendered unbootable.
2009-11-07T05:05:00.000Z	lockd	Ruge	about the only solution is probably switch to a distro that uses grub1
2009-11-07T05:05:00.000Z	lockd	Ruge	unless you can chroot into Ubuntu yourself and install grub1
2009-11-07T05:06:00.000Z	Ruge	lockd	serious?! but i wasted 700MB of bandwdith for this ISO...! ill try my luck on the forum thread too
2009-11-07T05:06:00.000Z	lockd	Ruge	chroot isn't THAT hard
2009-11-07T05:06:00.000Z	Ruge	lockd	im a noob with these things ;) what could i do?
2009-11-07T05:06:00.000Z	lockd	Ruge	blame Canonical for wanting the flashiest boot screens
2009-11-07T05:07:00.000Z	Ruge	lockd	Well, I can see why they'd want to do it. But I dont have an odd setup, all my Ubuntu, Windows installs have worked in the past. For me to put the disc in the first time, install and for it to fail... if i had to fork out cash to buy an OS Id be majorly pissed.
2009-11-07T05:08:00.000Z	lockd	Ruge	does grub hang, itself?
2009-11-07T05:09:00.000Z	lockd	Ruge	the configuration in grub2 is horribly grotesque, far worse than it was in the previous version
2009-11-07T05:09:00.000Z	Ruge	lockd	illg ive u the sequence of events, i boot my machine, it then says "Boot from CD..." as I havent chaged it, but that lasts 1/2 a second, then shows the text "GRUB" and thats it... hangs.
2009-11-07T05:10:00.000Z	lockd	Ruge	but it doesn't really boot from the CD, I hope
2009-11-07T05:10:00.000Z	lockd	Ruge	you have that removed, I take it
2009-11-07T05:14:00.000Z	Ruge	lockd	yeah, hmm
2009-11-07T05:14:00.000Z	Ruge	lockd	ill be back, breakfast, then ill see how it goes :)
2009-11-07T05:14:00.000Z	lockd	Ruge	do you have WinXP Pro installed?
2009-11-07T05:14:00.000Z	Ruge	lockd	nah deleted that
2009-11-07T05:15:00.000Z	Ruge	lockd	brb, thanks for your help so far tho :)
