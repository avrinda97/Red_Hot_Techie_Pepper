2006-01-04T15:13:00.000Z	crocd	lightbright	it is a bootable linux cd/floppy whith which you wipe a hard drive. you cannot do it within linux afaik.
2006-01-04T15:14:00.000Z	crocd	lightbright	Darik's Boot and Nuke ("DBAN") is a self-contained boot floppy that securely wipes the hard disks of most computers. DBAN will automatically and completely delete the contents of any hard disk that it can detect, which makes it an appropriate utility for bulk or emergency data destruction.
2006-01-04T15:14:00.000Z	lightbright	crocd	does dban recognise the Ubuntu hard drive or it only reads ntfs or fat32 hard drives?
2006-01-04T15:16:00.000Z	crocd	lightbright	no it wipes the hard drive regardless of the partion i have wiped a gentoo build with it.
2006-01-04T15:17:00.000Z	lightbright	crocd	ok thanks

2006-01-04T15:21:00.000Z	lightbright	crocd	can you tell dban to wipe the hard drives you chose? OR does it automatically wipe anything it finds?  Because I only want to wipe hdb1 and not hda
2006-01-04T15:21:00.000Z	crocd	lightbright	you can choose your hard drive. you will see when it boots up it gives you hard drives to select for wiping.
2006-01-04T15:22:00.000Z	lightbright	crocd	ok thanks
2006-01-04T15:23:00.000Z	lightbright	crocd	take long to wipe a 10 gig hard drive?
2006-01-04T15:24:00.000Z	crocd	lightbright	a while depends on the level of wiping you go for. cant remember the time fram exactly. About 20 min for 10 gb i think.
2006-01-04T15:25:00.000Z	lightbright	crocd	ok
