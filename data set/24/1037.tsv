2010-10-06T14:15:00.000Z	eureka_		i use asus laptop and ubuntu 10.10 lts but when I plug in my headphone i hear nothing
2010-10-06T14:15:00.000Z	eureka_		how can i fix it
2010-10-06T14:15:00.000Z	Benkinooby	eureka_	do you use gnome?
2010-10-06T14:15:00.000Z	eureka_	Benkinooby	yes
2010-10-06T14:16:00.000Z	Benkinooby	eureka_	hmm, i'm from the kde side, but try this: start up a terminal and enter alsamixer
2010-10-06T14:16:00.000Z	Benkinooby	eureka_	then press F5
2010-10-06T14:17:00.000Z	Benkinooby	eureka_	you should see the different mixers do you?
2010-10-06T14:18:00.000Z	eureka_	Benkinooby	: 2nd column is speaker
2010-10-06T14:19:00.000Z	Benkinooby	eureka_	hmm
2010-10-06T14:20:00.000Z	Benkinooby	eureka_	usually alsamixa in commandline is the most basic thing to work with, and afaik kmix and other gui-sound-mixers are just infterfaces for alsa.
2010-10-06T14:20:00.000Z	Benkinooby	eureka_	if you don't see headphones, it might me a driver problem, but i can be a simpler reason
2010-10-06T14:20:00.000Z	Benkinooby	eureka_	i allready saw some driver problems, but i never heard about problems with headphones
2010-10-06T14:21:00.000Z	Benkinooby	eureka_	so nothing that reminds of headphones? make the window as big as possible and be sure you pressed the key 'F5' to show all mixers
2010-10-06T14:21:00.000Z	Benkinooby	eureka_	use left and right key to navigate between the mixers
2010-10-06T14:22:00.000Z	Benkinooby	eureka_	is it a fresh install?
2010-10-06T14:23:00.000Z	Benkinooby	eureka_	did it work before?
2010-10-06T14:26:00.000Z	Benkinooby	eureka_	then you must have changed something
2010-10-06T14:26:00.000Z	Benkinooby	eureka_	i know, this is a M$-advice, but anyways: did you restart?
2010-10-06T14:26:00.000Z	eureka_	Benkinooby	: i'm not sure
2010-10-06T14:27:00.000Z	eureka_	Benkinooby	but i tried to adjust alsamixer as you told me before
2010-10-06T14:30:00.000Z	Benkinooby	eureka_	it can not be a driver problem, because then i the headphones should never have worked then. you also didn't mute them, because the you would see them in alsa mixer. so i don't know anyfurther, sorry. one last thing: try to put all mixers to maximum and test again
2010-10-06T14:30:00.000Z	Benkinooby	eureka_	it happened to me onece, that i was not able to use the mic. i found, that i had to put an extra mixer up to enable mic.
2010-10-06T14:31:00.000Z	Benkinooby	eureka_	what puzzles me is that you don't see a headphone mixer
2010-10-06T14:34:00.000Z	eureka_	Benkinooby	: my laptop has one line in for headphone and mic
