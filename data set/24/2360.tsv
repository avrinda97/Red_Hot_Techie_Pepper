2009-01-25T01:36:00.000Z	philsf	superhero	you probably meant that for someone else

2009-01-25T01:38:00.000Z	superhero	philsf	I haven't a problem with audio driver
2009-01-25T01:39:00.000Z	philsf	superhero	never? or just when other things are playing?
2009-01-25T01:39:00.000Z	superhero	philsf	but skype said: problem with audio playback
2009-01-25T01:39:00.000Z	philsf	superhero	you should probably complain to skype.com, since it's a bug in their end
2009-01-25T01:39:00.000Z	superhero	philsf	everythink is good, only skype make a problem
2009-01-25T01:39:00.000Z	philsf	superhero	it's a known bug, btw
