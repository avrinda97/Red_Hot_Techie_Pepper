2008-11-03T07:15:00.000Z	goodmami		so last night I used "shutdown -h 1:00" and went to bed. it seemed to shutdown fine. but when I turned the computer back on gnome-panel is completely borked
2008-11-03T07:16:00.000Z	musikgoat	goodmami	that command isn't correlated, as in its a very common command, but rebooting could have caused some other problem
2008-11-03T07:17:00.000Z	goodmami	musikgoat	is there anything I could do to diagnose what's wrong with gnome-panel?
2008-11-03T07:17:00.000Z	musikgoat	goodmami	what is up with gnome-panel?
2008-11-03T07:18:00.000Z	goodmami	musikgoat	the first time I logged in it was unresponsive, then i ctrl-alt-bksp logged out and back in again, and it disappeared
2008-11-03T07:19:00.000Z	goodmami	musikgoat	"ps -A | grep gnome-panel" shows it is running, though
2008-11-03T07:19:00.000Z	goodmami	musikgoat	but alt-f1 and alt-f2 do not work
2008-11-03T07:19:00.000Z	musikgoat	goodmami	goodmami is it repeatable after another reboot?
2008-11-03T07:20:00.000Z	musikgoat	goodmami	what happens when you sudo killall gnome-panel
2008-11-03T07:20:00.000Z	musikgoat	goodmami	it should auto restart
2008-11-03T07:21:00.000Z	goodmami	musikgoat	i only did "kill -9 (id of gnome-panel)" but that didn't do anything special... lemme try your suggestion
2008-11-03T07:22:00.000Z	goodmami	musikgoat	after 15 seconds no restart
2008-11-03T07:22:00.000Z	musikgoat	goodmami	its not showing in ps?
2008-11-03T07:23:00.000Z	musikgoat	goodmami	hmm, log out and back in now
2008-11-03T07:23:00.000Z	goodmami	musikgoat	ok... brb..
2008-11-03T07:25:00.000Z	goodmami	musikgoat	that seemed to do it! I wish I knew what was actually going on, but re-logging in after killing the panel seemed to work
2008-11-03T07:26:00.000Z	goodmami	musikgoat	thanks for the help (and Flannel for pitching in, too)
2008-11-03T07:26:00.000Z	musikgoat	goodmami	try sudo shutdown -h now and then reboot
2008-11-03T07:26:00.000Z	musikgoat	goodmami	if you want to test the problem
2008-11-03T07:26:00.000Z	goodmami	musikgoat	ok, will do... brb
2008-11-03T07:26:00.000Z	musikgoat	goodmami	if it happens again, there could be a bug
2008-11-03T07:30:00.000Z	goodmami	musikgoat	didn't die this time.
2008-11-03T07:30:00.000Z	musikgoat	goodmami	ok, wierd
2008-11-03T07:31:00.000Z	goodmami	musikgoat	yeah... well i'm running hardy, so if it's a bug hopefully it didn't make it into intrepid... i'll keep an eye out for it though
