2008-10-06T07:00:00.000Z	Mechdave	bazooka	or you could link it to /dev/null
2008-10-06T07:00:00.000Z	Mechdave	bazooka	you need to read man ln
2008-10-06T07:01:00.000Z	Mechdave	bazooka	but to start the command is like this --> ln -s /dev/null /path/to/document/root
2008-10-06T07:03:00.000Z	Mechdave	bazooka	Oops wrong... try this --> ln -s /path/to/document/root /dev/null
2008-10-06T07:03:00.000Z	Mechdave	bazooka	Oops double Oops
2008-10-06T07:03:00.000Z	Mechdave	bazooka	Oops double Oops --> Sorry REALLY wrong
2008-10-06T07:04:00.000Z	Mechdave	bazooka	don't do that... it will wreck your web server
2008-10-06T07:05:00.000Z	Mechdave	bazooka	try ln -s /path/to/document/root/favicon.ico /dev/null
2008-10-06T07:05:00.000Z	Mechdave	bazooka	now that should link favicon.ico to /dev/null which should stop your problem
