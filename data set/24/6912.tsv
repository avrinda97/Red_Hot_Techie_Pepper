2005-06-17T09:55:00.000Z	TokenBad		man...I can't figure out why cedega will not work
2005-06-17T09:57:00.000Z	TokenBad		it just gives errors
2005-06-17T09:58:00.000Z	TokenBad		cp: cannot stat `/usr/lib/transgaming_cedega//.transgaming': No such file or directory

2005-06-17T09:59:00.000Z	TokenBad		tgz
2005-06-17T09:59:00.000Z	TokenBad		I gunziped it
2005-06-17T09:59:00.000Z	TokenBad		then tar
2005-06-17T09:59:00.000Z	TokenBad		then tried to run ./cedega
2005-06-17T10:01:00.000Z	TokenBad		how would I install from a deb file?
2005-06-17T10:01:00.000Z	dr_willis	TokenBad	 the Cedega install docs tell you the exact process to get their packages installed.
2005-06-17T10:02:00.000Z	dr_willis	TokenBad	 thers about 4 packages you want to download/install.. OR just get their Point2Play program.
2005-06-19T09:57:00.000Z	dr_willis	TokenBad	 permission issues. perhaps set up the fstab to use the uid/gid/ and user and umask optins to all either one or all users to mount it.
2005-06-19T09:58:00.000Z	TokenBad	dr_willis	I tried to use fstab..but the way I did it..wouldn't work
2005-06-19T09:59:00.000Z	dr_willis	TokenBad	 this is a common 'problem' - i forget the exact way to do it. It depend son other details as to what exactly uou want. I normally set the uid,gid, and users/user option in fstab. to let the one user I use, mount and r/w the drive
2005-06-19T11:33:00.000Z	dr_willis	TokenBad	 heh you STILL trying to get that working?
2005-06-19T12:22:00.000Z	dr_willis	TokenBad	 perhaps a read of the wine docs. :P
2005-06-19T12:22:00.000Z	dr_willis	TokenBad	 wine /path/to/windows/program/foo.exe
2005-06-19T12:23:00.000Z	dr_willis	TokenBad	 and dont expect too much from wine. :P
2005-06-19T12:26:00.000Z	dr_willis	TokenBad	 and what programs are those?
2005-06-19T12:27:00.000Z	dr_willis	TokenBad	 useing wine to run a ftp server? thats... errr... perverted...
2005-06-19T12:29:00.000Z	dr_willis	TokenBad	 well first off.. why do you even need a ftp server. :P , install one is as simple as 'sudo apt-get install *nameofFTPserver*   , and ssh can basicially do all  that a ftp server can do for most needs. :P
2005-06-19T12:30:00.000Z	dr_willis	TokenBad	 ssh is one of the MUST learn about tools. :P
2005-06-19T12:31:00.000Z	dr_willis	TokenBad	 right after BASH :P  heh
2005-06-19T12:32:00.000Z	dr_willis	TokenBad	 yep.. i'd say spending an hr or 12 reading a few bash tutorials are worth the trouble.
