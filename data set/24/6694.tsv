2005-11-07T17:53:00.000Z	iiiears		just curious can you disable "sudo' for an account?
2005-11-07T17:54:00.000Z	dooglus	iiiears	sudo is set up to only work for members of the 'admin' group.  remove an account from 'admin' and they can't sudo any more
2005-11-07T17:55:00.000Z	dooglus	iiiears	be careful if you mess with the sudoers file.  first off use 'visudo' instead of editing the file by hand, and secondly, be careful not to mess it up, or you'll not be able to sudo to fix it
2005-11-07T17:56:00.000Z	iiiears	dooglus	- really appreciate the warning - gotten more than a couple hours of experience with live CD rescue tecniques. - lol
2005-11-07T11:14:00.000Z	iiiears	dooglus	- How does Win4Lin compare to Cedega in performance?
2005-11-07T11:14:00.000Z	dooglus	iiiears	I never got cedega to work
2006-06-08T09:30:00.000Z	dooglus	iiiears	you mean /mnt/cdrom?
2006-06-08T09:31:00.000Z	iiiears	dooglus	- lol - i haven't done it in a while the command is only likely to be close - give me a second to grab the link
2006-06-09T07:28:00.000Z	dooglus	iiiears	what I didn't like about tbird is that it constantly shows the headers and the attachments in the preview pane, leaving no space for the email itself!
2006-06-09T07:28:00.000Z	dooglus	iiiears	if there are too many attachments you literally cannot read the email!
2006-06-09T07:28:00.000Z	iiiears	dooglus	- Add a few hundred emails and it uses a lot of RAM also.
2006-06-09T07:29:00.000Z	dooglus	iiiears	I've not had a problem with it using too much RAM on ubuntu, and I put about 10,000 messages into it
2006-06-09T07:29:00.000Z	dooglus	iiiears	on Windows, however, it started hanging up badly at around the 8k messages mark
2006-06-09T16:54:00.000Z	iiiears	dooglus	- Where do you ssign hotkeys? Xmodmap?
2006-06-09T16:55:00.000Z	dooglus	iiiears	I don't, I use aliases.
2006-06-09T16:56:00.000Z	iiiears	dooglus	- Cool. What file holds them?
2006-06-09T16:57:00.000Z	iiiears	dooglus	- NVM - got it. (Google is my friend.)
2006-06-09T16:58:00.000Z	dooglus	iiiears	in ~/.bashrc I put things like: alias b='dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot'
2006-06-09T16:58:00.000Z	dooglus	iiiears	but see also shell functions - they're even more powerful
2006-06-09T16:59:00.000Z	iiiears	dooglus	- Linux is wonderful. - What was Bill Gates thinking when he neutered the CLI>
2006-07-26T10:07:00.000Z	dooglus	iiiears	hi
2006-07-26T10:08:00.000Z	dooglus	iiiears	yes, I have.
2006-07-26T10:08:00.000Z	iiiears	dooglus	- Was it after installing VMWare?
2006-07-26T10:09:00.000Z	dooglus	iiiears	I never installed VMware, no
