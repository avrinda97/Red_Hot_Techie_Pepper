2008-04-26T05:24:00.000Z	Juan		Hi everyone, i just got a quick question, i just updated ubuntu 8.04 and everything works as expected all i am wonderin is how can i redirect  the "documents music, picutres, videos, and the desktop" to a network share folder. i know in windows you right click then and choose redirect and then the address but how can you do it in ubuntu? thank you very much in advance (^ ^)v
2008-04-26T05:26:00.000Z	astro76	Juan	cd ~; rm Documents; ln -s /path/to/network/documents Documents
2008-04-26T05:37:00.000Z	Juan	astro76	could u explain the rm Documents once again this irc goes too fast please
2008-04-26T05:38:00.000Z	astro76	Juan	what are you trying to do?
2008-04-26T05:38:00.000Z	Juan	astro76	i am trying to redirect the documents and desktop into a share folder located in a windows server 2008
2008-04-26T05:39:00.000Z	astro76	Juan	why those subfolder? in particular why desktop?
2008-04-26T05:39:00.000Z	Juan	astro76	so that way the server can back up those files
2008-04-26T05:40:00.000Z	astro76	Juan	you don't want to mount the whole home directory remotely?
2008-04-26T05:41:00.000Z	Juan	astro76	well it's cuz i dont want ppl here to get confused and start saving in their computers instead of in the redirected folder. i also need to  mount the whole drive too cuz we use a public folder
2008-04-26T05:42:00.000Z	astro76	Juan	perhaps you should just mount the whole /home remotely
2008-04-26T05:42:00.000Z	Juan	astro76	how can i do it? cuz everytime i mount it next time i log in it is gone xD
2008-04-26T05:45:00.000Z	astro76	Juan	not sure but there's gotta be lots of info on doing that in Linux out there
2008-04-26T05:46:00.000Z	Juan	astro76	yes cuz when i tried doing it as a shortcut it will give me an error message =/
2008-04-26T05:48:00.000Z	astro76	Juan	links only work locally.. you need to do it in /etc/fstab, and obviously the network share would have to be connected to earlier in the boot process
2008-04-26T05:49:00.000Z	astro76	Juan	also you would want that share to support Linux file permissions, so that means no samba
2008-04-26T05:49:00.000Z	astro76	Juan	but NFS instead
2008-04-26T05:49:00.000Z	astro76	Juan	maybe you just want to use a backup script instead? ;)
2008-04-26T05:55:00.000Z	Juan	astro76	backup script?
2008-04-26T05:55:00.000Z	astro76	Juan	yes, backup instead of mounting the filesystem remotely
2008-04-26T06:00:00.000Z	Juan	astro76	how?
2008-04-26T06:06:00.000Z	Juan	astro76	thank you ^ ^
2008-04-26T06:10:00.000Z	Juan	astro76	just before i leave, there is no way that ubuntu can read a user profile of windows server correct?
2008-04-26T06:10:00.000Z	astro76	Juan	if you share it in windows you can access the files
2008-04-26T06:12:00.000Z	Juan	astro76	alrite thanks you so much for all your help ^_^
