2009-01-30T19:35:00.000Z	izinucs	Boomking	do you have an nvidia 8200 chipset board?
2009-01-30T19:35:00.000Z	izinucs	Boomking	is that a newer board?
2009-01-30T19:36:00.000Z	izinucs	Boomking	I had an issue with my am2 board.. xfxforce.. I had to add pci=nomsi to the kernel line to get it to boot properly.. even with the live cd
2009-01-30T19:37:00.000Z	izinucs	Boomking	yea.. it booted fine on my machine until I tried to install.. then I had issues with the partition manager and other areas
2009-01-30T19:39:00.000Z	izinucs	Boomking	yes.. except I just discovered a trick in menu.list to add the necessary line so when you get a kernel upgrade it doesn't go bonkers on you again
2009-01-30T19:39:00.000Z	Boomking	izinucs	can u please share :) lol this has been driving me crazy
2009-01-30T19:40:00.000Z	izinucs	Boomking	hang on and I'll pastebin mine.. it's not the same one I modified but I'll put an indicator in there where you're suppose to add and what..

2009-01-30T19:46:00.000Z	Boomking	izinucs	now to just figur out what to do with this lol , might have to get one of my friends over he = zealot
2009-01-30T19:47:00.000Z	izinucs	Boomking	did you look in the pastebin and see the line modification?
2009-01-30T19:48:00.000Z	Boomking	izinucs	well i got the link , but iam quite a newb so i might need to get a friend to help
2009-01-30T19:49:00.000Z	izinucs	Boomking	open the link and copy and paste the info in there to a file..  when you look at it you'll see a line where I wrote a comment describing what and where to put the modification.
2009-01-30T19:50:00.000Z	izinucs	Boomking	you still need to see if the mod actually works for you and your motherboard
2009-01-30T19:51:00.000Z	Boomking	izinucs	i plan to test it soon as i know what iam looking at :P
2009-01-30T19:51:00.000Z	izinucs	Boomking	have you actually done the install yet? or are you having issues with the live cd.?
2009-01-30T19:52:00.000Z	Boomking	izinucs	having issues with the live/ alternative , cd's
2009-01-30T19:53:00.000Z	Boomking	izinucs	when i click install on both cd's i jsut get the black screen with the flashing underscore
2009-01-30T19:54:00.000Z	izinucs	Boomking	ok.. on the live cd.. when you get to the screen with the menu to "install with no modification"  .. the first option.. hit F6 and at the end of the line that appears add pci=nomsi and then hit enter.. It should take you to the live cd desktop at that point.. if it did then the mod worked.
2009-01-30T19:55:00.000Z	Boomking	izinucs	iam gna try that quick
2009-01-30T20:02:00.000Z	Boomking	izinucs	thanks alot i finaly got past the instaltion :) do i have to worry about anything else untill a kernal update ?
2009-01-30T20:05:00.000Z	izinucs	Boomking	great!. once the system is installed you'll have to use the live cd to edit the same line in the installed system so it will boot.. you'll have to mount the drive and change directories to /boot/grub.. in there is the menu.lst file that needs modification.. put the mod on the actual kernel line in there.. save and reboot without the live cd.. then you have to go back in and make the mod like I
2009-01-30T20:08:00.000Z	Boomking	izinucs	:O ok so iam gna finish installing it , but then boot in with the live option :S
2009-01-30T20:09:00.000Z	izinucs	Boomking	yep.. and make the edit on the newly installed system
