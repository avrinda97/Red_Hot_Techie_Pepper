2008-02-13T08:05:00.000Z	wease|		if esc doesnt work go with ctrl-alt-backspace to the login
2008-02-13T08:06:00.000Z	wease|		wasney...it could be a safe effort on your side to reinstall as the workarounds arent a fix
2008-02-13T08:06:00.000Z	wease|		hammer89, can you run it from the admin menu?
2008-02-13T08:07:00.000Z	Hammer89	wease|	yes
2008-02-13T08:07:00.000Z	Hammer89	wease|	wait... no
2008-02-13T08:07:00.000Z	Hammer89	wease|	but I can run it if I run sudo gnome-system-monitor from terminal
2008-02-13T08:08:00.000Z	Hammer89	wease|	which isn't making any sense to me
2008-02-13T08:11:00.000Z	Hammer89	wease|	okay
2008-02-13T08:14:00.000Z	Hammer89	wease|	still giving me the same error... should I ctrl-alt-backspace for whatever I just did to take effect?
2008-02-13T08:16:00.000Z	Hammer89	wease|	could it be related to the kernel update I installed from synaptic?
2008-02-13T08:17:00.000Z	Hammer89	wease|	the system monitor doesn't load at all
2008-02-13T08:17:00.000Z	Hammer89	wease|	it feeds me that error before it gets anywhere
2008-02-13T08:22:00.000Z	Hammer89	wease|	no errors from the gui... only if I try running it from the terminal
2008-02-13T08:23:00.000Z	Hammer89	wease|	not that I know of
2008-02-13T08:24:00.000Z	Hammer89	wease|	there's another kernel upgrade out already... should I try installing it?
2008-02-13T08:25:00.000Z	Hammer89	wease|	yeah...
2008-02-13T08:25:00.000Z	Hammer89	wease|	maybe I'll do that... + restart the computer... see what that does for me
2008-02-13T08:26:00.000Z	Hammer89	wease|	alright... be back later
2008-02-13T08:39:00.000Z	Hammer89	wease|	gnome desktop manager
2008-02-13T08:45:00.000Z	Hammer89	wease|	yeah... what's the name of the package I'd have to reinstall?
2008-02-13T09:09:00.000Z	Hammer89	wease|	possibly... there seem to be deeper problems though... just from what I can see (stuff not initializing properly, etc...)
2008-02-13T09:11:00.000Z	Hammer89	wease|	would compiz really have any effect on elements of the desktop not drawing properly?
2008-02-13T09:17:00.000Z	Hammer89	wease|	I'm nearly desperate enough to try it
2008-02-13T09:18:00.000Z	Hammer89	wease|	except the theming on my laptop has hours of work behind it :P
