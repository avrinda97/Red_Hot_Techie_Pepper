2005-10-24T05:13:00.000Z	Acill		whhen I first got my install booted I had a ser account named guest. It was an account with admin access. I booted into that one, made a new user account for myself, changed the root password to a new one and restricted the guest account. When I log in as paul )the new user account) I have no home dor and it asks if I want to use the root home dor. It fails and wont log in. How can I get in as root or make that user account able to have admin
2005-10-24T05:13:00.000Z	Acill		 again to create another user that works?
2005-10-24T05:14:00.000Z	Acill		a gentoo one, and I have 2 other working linux installs on that drive
2005-10-24T05:15:00.000Z	Acill		done
2005-10-24T05:16:00.000Z	Acill		as the ubuntu is booting?

2005-10-24T05:17:00.000Z	mwe	Acill	you're not supposed to log in as root, if you can avoid it. log in as a user and use sudo or su -
2005-10-24T05:18:00.000Z	Acill	mwe	I an log in as guest still fine
2005-10-24T05:19:00.000Z	mwe	Acill	and you can't su? you said you set up a root password
2005-10-24T05:20:00.000Z	mwe	Acill	open a terminal and type su - and give it the root password you set up, though ubuntu recommends disabling root login
2005-10-24T05:21:00.000Z	mwe	Acill	no
2005-10-24T05:21:00.000Z	mwe	Acill	you created a root password, right?
2005-10-24T05:22:00.000Z	mwe	Acill	then open a gnome terminal
2005-10-24T05:22:00.000Z	mwe	Acill	then type su - and then the root password
2005-10-24T05:24:00.000Z	mwe	Acill	no maybe it's because the guest user is not a member of the admin group
2005-10-24T05:25:00.000Z	mwe	Acill	you don't have a user who is in the admin group?
2005-10-24T05:25:00.000Z	mwe	Acill	ok
2005-10-24T05:26:00.000Z	mwe	Acill	you can type ctrl+alt+f1 to get a console login , then log in as root. ctrl+alt+f7 will bring you back to X
2005-10-24T05:28:00.000Z	mwe	Acill	yes you have to do your root stuff from the console
2005-10-24T05:29:00.000Z	mwe	Acill	yes
2005-10-24T05:30:00.000Z	mwe	Acill	do what you need to do as root in the console outside X.
2005-10-24T05:31:00.000Z	mwe	Acill	what's the name of the user account that's broken?
2005-10-24T05:31:00.000Z	Acill	mwe	paul
2006-07-03T05:19:00.000Z	mwe	Acill	cp -a foo
