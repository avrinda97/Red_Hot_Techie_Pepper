2005-04-16T16:17:00.000Z	gingermark		there's a section on playing dvds in the unnoficial guide
2005-04-16T16:18:00.000Z	gingermark		http://www.ubuntuguide.org/#dvdplayback
2005-04-16T16:18:00.000Z	gingermark		but I've been using Linux for two days now, so don't know if that's helpful
2005-04-16T16:19:00.000Z	gingermark		Have any Totem experts entered the room since I last asked? :-)
2005-04-16T16:20:00.000Z	whiskers	gingermark	i used it on gentoo some...but not an expert
2005-04-16T16:21:00.000Z	whiskers	gingermark	well i never saw that on gentoo...let me see if totem works on hoary
2005-04-16T16:22:00.000Z	whiskers	gingermark	i only have a couple dvds but i will try
2005-04-16T16:32:00.000Z	gingermark	whiskers	I was looking for an official totem site just to see if this is a known bug, or a common problem, and if there was a solution there, but I can't seem to find it. DO you know if there is an official site?
2005-04-16T16:33:00.000Z	whiskers	gingermark	no...totem is a quite good player works very well on gentoo
2005-04-16T16:33:00.000Z	whiskers	gingermark	i think it is just a config issue
2005-04-16T16:33:00.000Z	whiskers	gingermark	or a permissions issue
2005-04-16T16:47:00.000Z	gingermark	whiskers	ok if I PM you?
2005-04-16T16:50:00.000Z	gingermark	whiskers	how so?
2005-04-16T16:51:00.000Z	whiskers	gingermark	wow finally killed it
2005-04-16T16:51:00.000Z	whiskers	gingermark	i was trying my other dvd and it just went into a hang read mode
2005-04-16T16:52:00.000Z	gingermark	whiskers	what kind if thing were you trying to do? You said something earlier about the config file?
2005-04-16T16:53:00.000Z	whiskers	gingermark	well i tell you...i wonder if it is just missing decss
2005-04-16T16:54:00.000Z	whiskers	gingermark	on gentoo there is a libdecss but i don't see it in synaptic
2005-04-16T16:57:00.000Z	gingermark	whiskers	I got mine here: http://www.ubuntuguide.org/#dvdplayback
2005-04-16T16:57:00.000Z	gingermark	whiskers	cheers for tryin
2005-04-16T05:03:00.000Z	whiskers	gingermark	ok ...well i guess it is just missing a file and i put the repositories in synaptic but dpkg does not find it
2005-04-16T05:03:00.000Z	whiskers	gingermark	but i don't care because i don't watch dvd's
2005-04-16T05:03:00.000Z	gingermark	whiskers	thanks for the effort
2005-04-16T05:03:00.000Z	whiskers	gingermark	i think everybody uses theora now
