2009-08-05T12:23:00.000Z	Ileden		The problem is, I have two drives, one that easily fits all the content of the other. I would like to keep the contents of the smaller drive as they are, for later inspection, and empty the drive for other uses. I thought it would be best if I could just get the partitions from the smaller drive as files on the larger drive, so that I could directly mount the files when I need to examine the contents (not having to bother with backup/restore). I don't need to wri
2009-08-05T12:24:00.000Z	Ileden		(In fact, is it even possible to "mount" a file...?)
2009-08-05T12:26:00.000Z	Ileden		I guess I could just copy all the files, but I don't want to clutter the files system, and one of the partitions is ntfs so I figure there might be problems with file names and such.
2009-08-05T12:26:00.000Z	geirha	Ileden	You can mount files, yes
2009-08-05T12:27:00.000Z	geirha	Ileden	Are they images of entire drives or one and one partition?
2009-08-05T12:28:00.000Z	Ileden	geirha	well right now I have 3 partitions, one of them ntfs, that i would like to copy as files (so I can release the hard disk to other uses)
2009-08-05T12:30:00.000Z	geirha	Ileden	You could just archive them with tar
2009-08-05T12:30:00.000Z	Ileden	geirha	I was thinking about that... but can I then expolre the tar archive by mountin it? and will tar archive work with possible ntfs file naming schemes?
2009-08-05T12:31:00.000Z	geirha	Ileden	cd /media/rootoffs1/; sudo tar zcvf /path/to/store/archive.tar.gz .
2009-08-05T12:32:00.000Z	geirha	Ileden	You can open the archive in the archive manager (by just double-clicking it) and explore what files it contains
2009-08-05T12:33:00.000Z	Ileden	geirha	will this preserve all the possible ntfs stuff (like permission) as well? with direct copying its at least an exact copy?
2009-08-05T12:33:00.000Z	geirha	Ileden	And there shouldn't be a problem taring down the files in an ntfs filesystem. The problem would be with extracting to an ntfs filesystem, since it's very picky about what characters you can have in filenames. ext3 accepts every concievable character in filenames, except / and \0
2009-08-05T12:34:00.000Z	Ileden	geirha	there's also the file permissions
2009-08-05T12:34:00.000Z	geirha	Ileden	Permissions on NTFS? Is that something new in newer Ubuntu versions?
2009-08-05T12:34:00.000Z	Ileden	geirha	it's a windows partition
2009-08-05T12:35:00.000Z	geirha	Ileden	At any rate, when tar is run as root (with sudo), it will preserve file permissions and ownership
2009-08-05T12:36:00.000Z	geirha	Ileden	NTFS did not have file permissions last time I messed around with such
2009-08-05T12:36:00.000Z	Ileden	geirha	hmm, windows does have a quite extensive permissions system, but it could of course be with windows itself, not with the file system...
2009-08-05T12:37:00.000Z	geirha	Ileden	Yeah, those are some ACLs that linux don't see/support. Don't know if they'll be preserved, so it might be best to copy the NTFS from windows.
2009-08-05T12:38:00.000Z	Ileden	geirha	well if I copy the direct partiton, they'll be presereved. I'd really rather not mess around with windows data copying right now :)
2009-08-05T12:39:00.000Z	Ileden	geirha	if there is a way to easily copy the entire partition data, that is.
2009-08-05T12:40:00.000Z	geirha	Ileden	Right, well, then unmount the drive, and make an image of the drive then. sudo dd if=/dev/sda1 of=/path/to/store/partition.img
2009-08-05T12:40:00.000Z	geirha	Ileden	unmount the windows partition I mean. Then run a dd command like that, replacing /dev/sda1 with the correct inode for your case
2009-08-05T12:41:00.000Z	Ileden	geirha	yup, thanks! so a simple dd is enough. nice!
