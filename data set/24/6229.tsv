2005-12-18T16:14:00.000Z	iustin		I need a little hint for merging two   ext3  partions , please !
2005-12-18T16:14:00.000Z	iustin		no
2005-12-18T16:14:00.000Z	iustin		it doesn`t
2005-12-18T16:15:00.000Z	erUSUL	iustin	try with gparted (umounted partitions use a livecd) but messing with partitions is risky business backup first
2005-12-18T16:15:00.000Z	iustin	erUSUL	i know but i am out of space !
2005-12-18T16:16:00.000Z	erUSUL	iustin	move the home to the new partition
2005-12-18T16:16:00.000Z	iustin	erUSUL	i will try with a live cd with gparrted
2005-12-18T16:16:00.000Z	iustin		ok
2005-12-18T16:16:00.000Z	iustin		how?
2005-12-18T16:17:00.000Z	iustin	erUSUL	i have a 5 Giga partition and it is full with applications that i need it
2005-12-18T16:18:00.000Z	erUSUL	iustin	if you have a new ext3 partition move all files of home to it then add a line to fstab to mount the new part in /home at boot time
2005-12-18T16:18:00.000Z	iustin	erUSUL	if i change home to new partition ... application will still install into my 5 giga partition
2005-12-18T16:18:00.000Z	erUSUL	iustin	yes
2005-12-18T16:18:00.000Z	erUSUL	iustin	but i was under the impresion that the bigger files where in home
2005-12-18T16:19:00.000Z	iustin	erUSUL	no ... i don`t have big files in home
2005-12-18T16:19:00.000Z	erUSUL	iustin	ops
2005-12-18T16:19:00.000Z	iustin	erUSUL	and neither partion magic don`t merge ext2/3
2005-12-18T16:20:00.000Z	erUSUL	iustin	then try gparted with all the warnings. i do not make any warranty
2005-12-18T16:21:00.000Z	iustin	erUSUL	gparted won`t merge my partiotions because one is mounted !!!
2005-12-18T16:22:00.000Z	erUSUL	iustin	i told you to do it from a livecd (knoppix comes with qparted)
2005-12-18T16:22:00.000Z	iustin		i will try damn small linux!!
2005-12-18T16:22:00.000Z	erUSUL	iustin	backup important data
2005-12-18T16:22:00.000Z	iustin		ok... in pursuit!
2005-12-18T16:22:00.000Z	iustin	erUSUL	thanks!
