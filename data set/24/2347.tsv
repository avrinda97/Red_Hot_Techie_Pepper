2009-01-17T02:03:00.000Z	Xae8koo		But my computer is dead. I pressed the button in the back. The button on the computer does nothing.
2009-01-17T02:03:00.000Z	Xae8koo		What should I do?
2009-01-17T02:03:00.000Z	ikonia	Xae8koo	button in the back - on the power supply, or the general on off button
2009-01-17T02:04:00.000Z	Xae8koo	ikonia	It is off, it wont come on.
2009-01-17T02:04:00.000Z	ikonia	Xae8koo	button in the back - on the power supply, or the general on off button
2009-01-17T02:04:00.000Z	Xae8koo	ikonia	No response...
2009-01-17T02:04:00.000Z	ikonia	Xae8koo	button in the back - the one on the power supply, or the general on / off button for your PC that you normally use
2009-01-17T02:05:00.000Z	Xae8koo	ikonia	It does nothing, just makes a click. No fan, no noise, nothing.
2009-01-17T02:05:00.000Z	ikonia	Xae8koo	I'll ask you one more time - READ the question I'm asking
2009-01-17T02:05:00.000Z	ikonia	Xae8koo	button in the back - the one on the power supply, or the general on / off button for your PC that you normally use
2009-01-17T02:06:00.000Z	Xae8koo	ikonia	Neither works. I turned it off with the button in the back. But no neither button does anything...
2009-01-17T02:06:00.000Z	ikonia	Xae8koo	button in the back - the one on the power supply, or the general on / off button for your PC that you normally use
2009-01-17T02:06:00.000Z	ikonia	Xae8koo	answer the question
2009-01-17T02:07:00.000Z	Xae8koo	ikonia	Button in the back = power supply button.
2009-01-17T02:07:00.000Z	ikonia	Xae8koo	ok - that is normally an on / off switch for the PSU - not the PC
2009-01-17T02:07:00.000Z	ikonia	Xae8koo	so what I suggest you do is flick it one more time, then press your normal on/off button on the front
2009-01-17T02:07:00.000Z	Xae8koo	ikonia	Nothing happens:(
2009-01-17T02:08:00.000Z	ikonia	Xae8koo	if that does noting, flick the PSU switch again and press the on / off button on the front
2009-01-17T02:09:00.000Z	ikonia	Xae8koo	how's it looking after you've flicked the switch again and pressed the front bit
2009-01-17T02:10:00.000Z	Xae8koo	ikonia	No sound, no ligth, nothing happesn. I take the psu button off, try power button in front, nothing. Then turn it the other side, then power button in the front, still nothing.
2009-01-17T02:10:00.000Z	ikonia	Xae8koo	sounds like a dead component then, contact a PC repair guy
