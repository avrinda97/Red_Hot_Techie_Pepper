2005-08-02T06:38:00.000Z	eth42	jedix	MPlayer messages are always a bit freaky
2005-08-02T06:39:00.000Z	jedix	eth42	totem says it can't play ac3 streams and stops
2005-08-02T06:39:00.000Z	eth42	jedix	that looks strange: The selected video_out device is incompatible with this codec. VDecoder init failed :(
2005-08-02T06:40:00.000Z	jedix	eth42	but it's the sound that throws the sig11
2005-08-02T06:40:00.000Z	eth42	jedix	sorry! I don't know
