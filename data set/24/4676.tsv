2007-02-08T08:21:00.000Z	andou		My first ever irc session.
2007-02-08T08:21:00.000Z	andou		Thanks :D
2007-02-08T08:23:00.000Z	andou		I'm just wondering, is LAMP a good way to go for setting up a Webserver?
2007-02-08T08:23:00.000Z	Quintin	andou	well duh
2007-02-08T08:23:00.000Z	andou	Quintin	Hehe. ok, I guess I deserved that.
2007-02-08T08:33:00.000Z	Quintin	andou	not really..  I don't think average person needs more than 1ghz cpu, 512mb ram :P
2007-02-17T11:25:00.000Z	Quintin	andou	no
2007-02-17T11:26:00.000Z	andou	Quintin	So, can I just use my ipaddress and then instead of http://.* I could use ftp://myipaddress?
2007-02-17T11:26:00.000Z	Quintin	andou	Yes.
2007-02-17T11:27:00.000Z	Quintin	andou	You might need to do some port-forwarding if you're behind a NAT router.  Also make sure that that port is not being blocked by your ISP.
2007-02-17T11:30:00.000Z	andou	Quintin	Thanks for the advice :)
2007-02-17T11:30:00.000Z	Quintin	andou	you're welcome :)
2007-02-17T11:31:00.000Z	Quintin	andou	as an aside, FTP is totally insecure.  You should be aware of this if you're going to run a public server.
2007-02-17T11:31:00.000Z	andou	Quintin	Ok. I don't really know what you mean though. I've heard something about SFTP. Would that be a better option?
2007-02-17T11:32:00.000Z	Quintin	andou	The internet is insecure, by design.
2007-02-17T11:32:00.000Z	Quintin	andou	I mean that the data you send, but more importantly the *credentials* you send, are sent in cleartext.
2007-02-17T11:33:00.000Z	Quintin	andou	type 'traceroute google.com' in a terminal.  Anyone on any of the computers between you and the remote site can sniff traffic, get access to login details, and proceed to do bad stuff.
2007-02-17T11:33:00.000Z	Quintin	andou	I would use scp.  http://winscp.sf.net/ is an opensource, easy to use scp/sftp client that you can use on windows machines.  On ubuntu, you can use scp command-line program or you can mount with sshfs or the built-in gnome tool for mounting ssh
2007-02-17T11:33:00.000Z	andou	Quintin	I won't be putting anything of 'real' importance on the ftp. I just want to use it for practice. Also, I'm in Korea and an associate of mine will be sending video files from Australia that we will edit here
2007-02-17T11:34:00.000Z	andou	Quintin	I thought an FTP would be the best way to send the files.
2007-02-17T11:34:00.000Z	Quintin	andou	Use a different user account than your own, and set the shell of that account to /bin/false.
2007-02-17T11:35:00.000Z	Quintin	andou	From command-line 'sudo usermod -s /bin/false ftp' to change ftp user to have a non-login shell.  Then you should be ok
2007-02-17T11:36:00.000Z	andou	Quintin	Ok. That's some great advice. I'm checking it out now. Thanks for that.
2007-02-17T11:36:00.000Z	Quintin	andou	glad to help
