2007-12-04T01:50:00.000Z	Sharpie	MikeH	if you have the settings manager, you can choose between none, normal, extra and custom
2007-12-04T01:50:00.000Z	MikeH	Sharpie	I'm on gutsy and can only see none, normal and extra.
2007-12-04T01:50:00.000Z	Sharpie	MikeH	if you don't have it: sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager
2007-12-04T01:51:00.000Z	MikeH	Sharpie	Just done that, I'm looking for it now :P
2007-12-04T01:51:00.000Z	MikeH	Sharpie	Ok, so I found that, but when I try and open it, the screen jigs, and nothing happens?
2007-12-04T01:53:00.000Z	Sharpie	MikeH	you have an ATI gfx card, i presume?
2007-12-04T01:53:00.000Z	MikeH	Sharpie	yes.
2007-12-04T01:53:00.000Z	Sharpie	MikeH	umm, go to System->Administration->Restricted Drivers Manager
2007-12-04T01:54:00.000Z	Sharpie	MikeH	is your card there?
2007-12-04T01:54:00.000Z	Sharpie	MikeH	enable it
2007-12-04T01:54:00.000Z	MikeH	Sharpie	I want to enable it?
2007-12-04T01:56:00.000Z	MikeH	Sharpie	Then what? Restart X?
2007-12-04T01:56:00.000Z	Sharpie	MikeH	it should ask for a restart
2007-12-04T02:04:00.000Z	MikeH	Sharpie	ok, I've done that, and custom has appeared. However, when I choose custom I get an error saying Composite Extension isn't available?
2007-12-04T02:04:00.000Z	Sharpie	MikeH	hm, check if the drivers are enabled
2007-12-04T02:04:00.000Z	Sharpie	MikeH	in the restricted drivers manager
2007-12-04T02:05:00.000Z	Sharpie	MikeH	hold on a sec
2007-12-04T02:07:00.000Z	Sharpie	MikeH	run "compiz --replace" in a terminal and paste the output in www.pastebin.com
2007-12-04T02:07:00.000Z	MikeH	Sharpie	no need for pastebin; No whitelisted driver found; aborting and using fallback: /usr/bin/metacity
