2009-09-20T05:55:00.000Z	mdg_	zebastian	what kind of wifi card you have?
2009-09-20T05:56:00.000Z	mdg_	zebastian	lspci in a terminal, if USB then lsusb
2009-09-20T05:59:00.000Z	mdg_	zebastian	what do you get from the command "ifconfig"
2009-09-20T06:00:00.000Z	mdg_	zebastian	you don't have wireless interface setup
2009-09-20T06:01:00.000Z	mdg_	zebastian	you are using wicd - what does it show for the name of your wireless connection?
2009-09-20T06:02:00.000Z	mdg_	zebastian	whats "cap"
2009-09-20T06:03:00.000Z	mdg_	zebastian	you are too far ahead there - in wicd, you need to tell it what your  wireless interface is called - I use "wlan0"
2009-09-20T06:04:00.000Z	mdg_	zebastian	this is configuring linux to use the wireless card
2009-09-20T06:06:00.000Z	mdg_	zebastian	in WICD, you need to setup your wireless interface - tell it what you want to use - - I suggest using "wlan0" (thats a zero not an oh)
2009-09-20T06:06:00.000Z	mdg_	zebastian	I don't have WICD installed right now.
2009-09-20T06:06:00.000Z	mdg_	zebastian	 WICD has a GUI
2009-09-20T06:07:00.000Z	mdg_	zebastian	lets back up here - in a terminal type sudo iwlist scan and tell us what you see
2009-09-20T06:09:00.000Z	mdg_	zebastian	"sudo iwlist scan" (without quotes)
2009-09-20T06:11:00.000Z	mdg_	zebastian	again, no wifi interface is setup...
