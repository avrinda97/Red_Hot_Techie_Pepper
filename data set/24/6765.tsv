2005-07-24T06:44:00.000Z	Thewarmachine		yes nickrud!
2005-07-24T06:45:00.000Z	nickrud	Thewarmachine	it's a generic interface to netscape/mozilla/firefox that allows a program to call up a web page
2005-07-24T06:46:00.000Z	Thewarmachine	nickrud	whats a really fast cd ripper
2005-07-24T06:47:00.000Z	nickrud	Thewarmachine	not really, but I tend to use sensible-browser in anything that calls gnome-moz-remote
2005-07-24T06:47:00.000Z	nickrud	Thewarmachine	cdripping is pretty much taken care of in linux by cdparanoia, most apps use that app
2005-07-24T06:48:00.000Z	Thewarmachine	nickrud	i get speeds of no greater than 2x
2005-07-24T06:49:00.000Z	nickrud	Thewarmachine	maybe try sudo hdparm -d1 /dev/<cdrom> , I've heard that that can speed things up
2005-07-24T06:49:00.000Z	nickrud	Thewarmachine	that sets dma to on
2005-07-24T06:52:00.000Z	Thewarmachine	nickrud	that command you gave me doesnt work
2005-07-24T06:52:00.000Z	nickrud	Thewarmachine	sensible-browser?
2005-07-24T06:53:00.000Z	nickrud	Thewarmachine	I just did it, and got firefox
2005-07-24T06:53:00.000Z	nickrud	Thewarmachine	ah, I use grip as my ripper
2005-07-24T06:55:00.000Z	nickrud	Thewarmachine	'gives me nothing', explain please
2005-07-24T06:57:00.000Z	nickrud	Thewarmachine	since I don't know your drive, maybe it cannot handle dma. We're pushing the limits of my hardware knowledge here
2005-07-24T06:59:00.000Z	nickrud	Thewarmachine	then, it looks like dma is not an option on your cd drive ;(
