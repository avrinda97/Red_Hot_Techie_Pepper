2007-07-10T08:41:00.000Z	labradors		SITUATION: A private school in a remote area of a third-world country; no Internet connection on-site (only in the city, where I am now); 60 Windows XP machines to use as clients; want to set up ubuntu as samba server.  QUESTION: For the given situation, is 7.04 better, or is 6.06LTS better?
2007-07-10T08:43:00.000Z	labradors		Nearest Internet connection is about nine miles.
2007-07-10T08:43:00.000Z	labradors		Due to terrain and road conditions, that's about a 45-minute drive.
2007-07-10T08:43:00.000Z	berent	labradors	: without internet how are u in IRC
2007-07-10T08:45:00.000Z	berent	labradors	: this seems the question of the day . rib tickling
2007-07-10T09:11:00.000Z	berent	labradors	: i wonder Honduras is so backward!!! or are you simply crafting out
2007-07-10T08:48:00.000Z	berent	labradors	: a linux server for a windows . which country is that!!
2007-07-10T08:53:00.000Z	berent	labradors	: it can be installed easily no probs
2007-07-10T08:53:00.000Z	berent	labradors	: you are already in city right
2007-07-10T08:54:00.000Z	berent	labradors	: make sure you download all dependent packs also
2007-07-10T08:55:00.000Z	berent	labradors	: best is to get the server and install and then take it back
2007-07-10T08:57:00.000Z	berent	labradors	: pack it up in a cushioned box to resist the bumpy drive. take help of a packer
2007-07-10T08:57:00.000Z	berent	labradors	: i dont think there is any software for that!
2007-07-10T08:58:00.000Z	labradors	berent	must find way to get it to fit through a school-bus door once it has been packaged sufficiently.
2007-07-10T08:58:00.000Z	berent	labradors	: does it open from top!
2007-07-10T08:59:00.000Z	berent	labradors	: try a rescue boat on river
2007-07-10T09:04:00.000Z	berent	labradors	: normally servers never need to update as they are serving a LAN . so once it works there is no need to update. For a school its more than enuf
2007-07-10T09:05:00.000Z	berent	labradors	: but yeah you have to cross the river though
2007-07-10T09:07:00.000Z	berent	labradors	: try apt-get . it recovers with any previously cut package
2007-07-10T09:09:00.000Z	berent	labradors	: why don't you get a  cd shipped
2007-07-10T09:10:00.000Z	labradors	berent	because the postal service is much less reliable.  A post card may take 6-8 weeks, IF it gets there.
2007-07-10T09:12:00.000Z	labradors	berent	it's an odd mix here.  Some things you would not expect to find are easy to get.  Other things that you WOULD expect can be just about unknown.
2007-07-10T09:14:00.000Z	berent	labradors	: then burn a iso image onto a cd/dvd and take it
2007-07-10T09:18:00.000Z	berent	labradors	: which is ur processor amd/ intel
