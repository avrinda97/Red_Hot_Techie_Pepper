2011-04-16T00:09:00.000Z	sunil_		anyone can guide me to make project on linux?
2011-04-16T00:09:00.000Z	ayecee	sunil_	what do you need to know?
2011-04-16T00:11:00.000Z	ayecee	sunil_	what kind of project?
2011-04-16T00:16:00.000Z	ayecee	sunil_	what kind of project is that?
2011-04-16T00:18:00.000Z	ayecee	sunil_	i've heard of irc. what does that have to do with your project?
2011-04-16T00:19:00.000Z	ayecee	sunil_	I feel the same way.
2011-04-16T00:21:00.000Z	ayecee	sunil_	I don't understand what you mean by project.
2011-04-16T00:23:00.000Z	ayecee	sunil_	you would like to write an irc client? do I understand now?
2011-04-16T00:24:00.000Z	ayecee	sunil_	what language do you intend to write it with?
2011-04-16T00:24:00.000Z	ayecee	sunil_	for instance, C, C++, java, perl, shell script
2011-04-16T00:26:00.000Z	ayecee	sunil_	have you written a program before? If so, what language did you use?
2011-04-16T00:27:00.000Z	ayecee	sunil_	okay. next step is to get a description of the irc protocol. It's in RFC1459, and there's a copy here: http://www.irchelp.org/irchelp/rfc/rfc.html
2011-04-16T00:28:00.000Z	ayecee	sunil_	you will need to understand how to make tcp connections in java. Beyond that, there is no API.
2011-04-16T00:29:00.000Z	ayecee	sunil_	yes
2011-04-16T00:31:00.000Z	ayecee	sunil_	java programming questions are out of scope for this channel. Is there a java channel?
2011-04-16T00:31:00.000Z	ayecee	sunil_	there we go, try #java. Maybe they can suggests some resources for socket programming in java.
2011-04-16T00:33:00.000Z	ayecee	sunil_	it is not a website, it is an irc channel
2011-04-16T00:33:00.000Z	ayecee	sunil_	type /join #java
2011-04-16T00:34:00.000Z	ayecee	sunil_	you did not copy the whole url
2011-04-16T00:36:00.000Z	ayecee	sunil_	what happens when you try?
2011-04-16T00:37:00.000Z	ayecee	sunil_	okay, try http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1459
2011-04-16T00:41:00.000Z	ayecee	sunil_	yes, but programming questions are not proper for this channel.
2011-04-16T00:43:00.000Z	ayecee	sunil_	I do not have any websites memorized, I would have to use google to find one
2011-04-16T00:43:00.000Z	ayecee	sunil_	however, there is a irc channel for java. To enter it, type /join #java
