2007-10-08T12:04:00.000Z	Skyrail		If I wanted sites to be blocked from being accessed on a PC, and redirecting to another page say how would I go about this? Can I use the hosts.deny file? Or do I have to use something like a firewall or, what can I use?
2007-10-08T12:04:00.000Z	Seveas	Skyrail	put them in /etc/hosts with ip address 127.0.0.1
2007-10-08T12:05:00.000Z	Skyrail	Seveas	right, I'll look into the hosts file
2007-10-08T12:07:00.000Z	Skyrail	Seveas	will I have to restart anything for the changes to come into effect?
2007-10-08T12:07:00.000Z	Seveas	Skyrail	no
2007-10-08T12:12:00.000Z	Skyrail	Seveas	can I use wildcards in the hosts file?
2007-10-08T12:13:00.000Z	Seveas	Skyrail	no
2007-10-08T12:13:00.000Z	Skyrail	Seveas	mhmm, ok. Just need to look into networking more, can I use the hosts file if the machine was used as a gateway/router/firewall?
2008-07-19T03:42:00.000Z	Seveas	Skyrail	the video problem could be a missing driver (how new is the card?) Haven't heard of unrecognized disks in a looooooong time though. Is the cd ok?
2008-07-19T03:43:00.000Z	Skyrail	Seveas	the card is an nVidia 7900GS so it's 'quite' new so to speak. I always have video card problems. Always, no matter what the card it's a complete pain as I can never seem to remember how to fix it properly, and if I do It never works more then once.
2008-07-19T03:44:00.000Z	Seveas	Skyrail	ubuntu devs are still improving nvidia driver integration. After installing hardy (when that finally succeeds) try using the envy tool for the videocard
2008-07-19T03:44:00.000Z	Seveas	Skyrail	still puzzled about the disks though... what kind of disks? does 'sudo fdisk -l' see them?
2008-07-19T03:45:00.000Z	Skyrail	Seveas	two different ones, both 250Gb SATA :/ fdisk sees...nothing 0_o
2008-07-19T03:52:00.000Z	Skyrail	Seveas	does the not-finding-harddisks problem sound like a corrupt download?
2008-07-19T03:53:00.000Z	Seveas	Skyrail	not necessarily
2008-07-19T03:54:00.000Z	Skyrail	Seveas	if it's nothing terribly obvious or a problem with ubuntu/my hardware then maybe I should try and see if other distros recognise them...I need to get some up-to-date distros really haha
2008-07-19T03:55:00.000Z	Seveas	Skyrail	try fedora, their latest version is a bit newer than ubuntu's latest. Could just be the difference. I suspect a missing driver for your sata controller
2008-07-19T03:57:00.000Z	Skyrail	Seveas	that's a shame, maybe i can try next release, or if anyone creates the drivers for the next update for 8.04. I'll scout around for other distros, I just picked ubuntu as it was the first distro I picked a while ago to get into linux =]
2008-07-19T03:58:00.000Z	Seveas	Skyrail	the 2nd alpha version of the next ubuntu release is also out already. You could try that to see if the driver is there. It's not recommended for daily use yet though
2008-07-19T04:11:00.000Z	Seveas	Skyrail	what did Jack_Sparrow say?
2008-07-19T04:12:00.000Z	Seveas	Skyrail	interesting. In that case I'm interested in the output of dmesg now and the output of dmesg after a reboot without doing that. Maybe we can isolate the problem
2008-07-19T04:15:00.000Z	Skyrail	Seveas	okay, I've piped it to a file, I'll upload the file and I'll restart and do the same thing :)
2008-07-19T04:28:00.000Z	Skyrail	Seveas	any idea how to compare to files (or large text blocks) quickly and easily? And I'm sure dmesg doesn't show all of the messages shown at boot up :/
2008-07-19T04:55:00.000Z	Skyrail	Seveas	well there were definitely a large number of changes, it's a matter of going through them and knowing what to look for I guess?
