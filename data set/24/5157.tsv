2006-10-07T09:58:00.000Z	floyd2		is there any way to make a deb from a tar.gz source to make installation easier?
2006-10-07T10:00:00.000Z	mister_roboto	floyd2	usually the contents of a tar.gz consist of a configure script and makefile with source code, not a binary install package
2006-10-07T10:00:00.000Z	floyd2	mister_roboto	yes that is the kind of tar.gz I mean
2006-10-07T10:00:00.000Z	mister_roboto	floyd2	usually, just "tar xzf <file> && cd <dir> && configure && make && sudo make install"
2006-10-07T10:01:00.000Z	floyd2	mister_roboto	yeah. That almost never works. make is always missing something.
2006-10-07T10:02:00.000Z	mister_roboto	floyd2	that's why is a lot easier to just install from the repositories if you can find it there :)   tracking down dependencies and installing those separately can break your distribution, potentially, if you don't know what the commands do
2006-10-07T10:03:00.000Z	floyd2	mister_roboto	why doesn't Ubuntu keep their packages up to date? software for dapper is like a year old
2006-10-07T10:03:00.000Z	mister_roboto	floyd2	well... the next version (Edgy, 6.10) is just about to be released and it has a lot of new stuff
2006-10-07T10:04:00.000Z	mister_roboto	floyd2	you can upgrade to that
2006-10-07T10:04:00.000Z	floyd2	mister_roboto	all software I install has bugs fixed in some version like 2 upgrades later but you can't upgrade because Ubuntu doesn't update their packages
2006-10-07T10:05:00.000Z	mister_roboto	floyd2	are you running dapper? you can do a couple of things, first if you're on dapper, enable the backports repository. or you can just upgrade your whole distro to edgy
2006-10-07T10:09:00.000Z	mister_roboto	floyd2	well... if you don't want edgy and you need a new version now, you can always just install from source. you say "it never works" but that's not entirely true and you might need to learn a few things, but hatt's always an option
2006-10-07T10:20:00.000Z	mister_roboto	floyd2	i'm using edgy on my laptop and on a vmware vm on windows with no issues, fyi
2006-10-07T10:32:00.000Z	mister_roboto	floyd2	you can see that with "apt-cache policy <pkg name>"
2006-10-07T10:32:00.000Z	mister_roboto	floyd2	not sure about in synaptic
2006-10-07T10:33:00.000Z	floyd2	mister_roboto	yeah I was wondering in the update manager. It would be nice to see if a particular update is "safe" (from a supported repo) before installing it.
2006-10-07T11:46:00.000Z	mister_roboto	floyd2	does that mean they ARE in the repositories?  :)
2006-10-07T11:46:00.000Z	floyd2	mister_roboto	apt-cache search does not find them
2006-10-07T11:47:00.000Z	mister_roboto	floyd2	stupid joke, sorry :)  (why aren't they not in the repos)    i don't know how the ubuntu folks select their standard packages
2006-10-07T11:48:00.000Z	mister_roboto	floyd2	you can instal .debs from anywhere, not just the standards repos
2006-10-07T11:48:00.000Z	mister_roboto	floyd2	at your own risk, of course
2006-10-07T11:49:00.000Z	floyd2	mister_roboto	right with you...but if Ubuntu is distributing them there....why not in universe repo too?
2006-10-07T11:50:00.000Z	mister_roboto	floyd2	that's a good question. you checked and they aren't there? what about multiverse?
2006-10-07T11:51:00.000Z	floyd2	mister_roboto	I found a package for quodlibet 0.23.1 in there but its not in the repos for sure
