2007-12-15T00:39:00.000Z	daemonik		hello, I seem to be having a problem connecting directly to only one particular site, www.salesforce.com, from my new ubuntu 7.10 system, but it seems that if i try to use a proxy i can connect... I know the site is not blacklisting my IP or host, since other systems on the same network can connect perfectly.... can someone please offer some assistance
2007-12-15T00:41:00.000Z	vg05	daemonik	can you access the site at all or just not log in ?
2007-12-15T00:42:00.000Z	daemonik	vg05	i can ping it and it seems to connect, but the web pages just never load :S
2007-12-15T00:42:00.000Z	daemonik	vg05	i telnet'd to the site and did a http get and can get the page though
2007-12-15T00:42:00.000Z	vg05	daemonik	what ip address do you get when you ping it ?
2007-12-15T00:43:00.000Z	daemonik	vg05	204.14.234.33
2007-12-15T00:43:00.000Z	vg05	daemonik	same thing i get
2007-12-15T00:43:00.000Z	vg05	daemonik	can you load it via ip ?
2007-12-15T00:43:00.000Z	vg05	daemonik	it is strange, im on a live cd 7.10 and able to access the page fine w/ firefox
2007-12-15T00:44:00.000Z	daemonik	vg05	i get the same issue trying to open the IP address
2007-12-15T00:44:00.000Z	vg05	daemonik	and you said you can ping it ?
2007-12-15T00:44:00.000Z	daemonik	vg05	I tried booting the 7.10 live cd and got the same issue :P
2007-12-15T00:44:00.000Z	vg05	daemonik	the ip loaded the page for me.  and if a proxy works, sounds like SF is blocking your IP
2007-12-15T00:45:00.000Z	vg05	daemonik	cause if you use the live cd, the only difference is between me and you is your IP address
2007-12-15T00:45:00.000Z	daemonik	vg05	wouldn't that stop me from getting the page via telnet still though?
2007-12-15T00:45:00.000Z	vg05	daemonik	depends on how they block
2007-12-15T00:46:00.000Z	vg05	daemonik	have you tried different browsers on your box ?
2007-12-15T00:46:00.000Z	daemonik	vg05	I've tried opera, links, lynx, galeon, firefox....
2007-12-15T00:46:00.000Z	vg05	daemonik	all same issue ?
2007-12-15T00:47:00.000Z	daemonik	vg05	the strange thing is that there are other people in the same office with the same external IP address and they can access it perfectly too
2007-12-15T00:47:00.000Z	daemonik	vg05	yes same issue with all browsers, even links :P
2007-12-15T00:47:00.000Z	vg05	daemonik	can everyone else in the office connect and you are the only one who cant ?
2007-12-15T00:48:00.000Z	vg05	daemonik	just throwing out ideas, try a different nic in your computer ?
2007-12-15T00:48:00.000Z	daemonik	vg05	yes everyone else connects without an issue so i don't think they could be blocking the IP address :P
