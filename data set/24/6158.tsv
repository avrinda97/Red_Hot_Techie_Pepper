2005-12-31T17:32:00.000Z	MaDSeN_		./ati-driver-installer-8.20.8.run to launch the ATI Proprietary Linux driver installer.
2005-12-31T17:32:00.000Z	MaDSeN_		is this wrong?
2005-12-31T17:32:00.000Z	MaDSeN_		I get permission denied
2005-12-31T17:34:00.000Z	mwe	MaDSeN_	sudo, command not found?
2005-12-31T17:34:00.000Z	mwe	MaDSeN_	impossible
2005-12-31T17:35:00.000Z	mwe	MaDSeN_	unless your system is seriously broken
2005-12-31T17:38:00.000Z	mwe	MaDSeN_	try sudo ./ati-dr<tab> <enter> again
2005-12-31T17:39:00.000Z	mwe	MaDSeN_	and maybe you need chmod +x ati-dr<tab><enter> first
2005-12-31T17:41:00.000Z	MaDSeN_	mwe	thnx for your help !
2005-12-31T17:41:00.000Z	mwe	MaDSeN_	you're welcome. there's still a long way to go before the driver is installed and working though
2005-12-31T17:42:00.000Z	MaDSeN_	mwe	should I reboot afterwards?
2005-12-31T17:42:00.000Z	mwe	MaDSeN_	after what? just running the file will not install the driver and make your system use it
2005-12-31T17:43:00.000Z	MaDSeN_	mwe	yes I got some reading to do.. I know
2005-12-31T17:44:00.000Z	mwe	MaDSeN_	but when the dirver is installed and xorg.conf edited, rebooting is probably the easiest way to make sure everything is loaded correctly.
2005-12-31T17:44:00.000Z	mwe	MaDSeN_	are you following the wiki?
2005-12-31T17:46:00.000Z	mwe	MaDSeN_	it is essential that you throw 'fglrx' into /etc/modules to make it load everytime you boot
2005-12-31T17:47:00.000Z	MaDSeN_	mwe	following this ----> https://a248.e.akamai.net/f/674/9206/0/www2.ati.com/drivers/linux/linux_8.20.8-inst.html
2005-12-31T17:48:00.000Z	mwe	MaDSeN_	ok. putting 'fglrx' into /etc/modules is essential in ubuntu to make the module autoload at boot
2005-12-31T17:50:00.000Z	mwe	MaDSeN_	look at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI too even though you're not using the ubuntu package. the ati site lacks sufficient info
2005-12-31T17:50:00.000Z	MaDSeN_	mwe	can it be that i dont have an /modules?
2005-12-31T17:50:00.000Z	mwe	MaDSeN_	/etc/modules
2005-12-31T17:51:00.000Z	mwe	MaDSeN_	it should be present
2005-12-31T17:51:00.000Z	mwe	MaDSeN_	and you need to edit it with sudo gedit /etc/modules
2005-12-31T17:52:00.000Z	mwe	MaDSeN_	did you install the .deb it created?
