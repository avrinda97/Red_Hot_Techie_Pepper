2008-05-23T03:06:00.000Z	Lanlost		This is my problem and why I am using Linux..
2008-05-23T03:06:00.000Z	Lanlost		I have a 1050x.. which although the 1550 is a few years old.. should be good enough to run video full screen without dropping frames. my older card did it fine
2008-05-23T03:06:00.000Z	Lanlost		When I open up a YouTube page.. it renders fine.. but if I zoom in or make it full screen.. I don't get full frame rate
2008-05-23T03:07:00.000Z	Lanlost		if I put it in low quality and do it.. then it work's fine
2008-05-23T03:07:00.000Z	Lanlost		but I don't want to have to watch all youtube vidoes in low quality
2008-05-23T03:07:00.000Z	Lanlost		In XP I can have like 20 YouTubes open all running and I get full speed on all of them
2008-05-23T03:07:00.000Z	Lanlost		so why in Linux and Vista can I not run a single window full screen at high quality?
2008-05-23T03:07:00.000Z	Lanlost		It's seriously a difference like that
2008-05-23T03:07:00.000Z	Lanlost		20 windows rendering compared to a single one
2008-05-23T03:08:00.000Z	Lanlost		It's annoying becuase all I do is program, visit digg, wikipedia and YouTube/Google Video (mostly for documentaries)
2008-05-23T03:08:00.000Z	Slart	Lanlost	because flash sucks in linux and youtube uses flash?
2008-05-23T03:08:00.000Z	Lanlost	Slart	correct
2008-05-23T03:10:00.000Z	Slart	Lanlost	yes you can.. just not using flash
2008-05-23T03:41:00.000Z	Slart	Lanlost	can't you see what kernel module you're using?
2008-05-23T03:42:00.000Z	Slart	Lanlost	lsmod
2008-05-23T03:42:00.000Z	Lanlost	Slart	THANK YOU
2008-05-23T03:42:00.000Z	Slart	Lanlost	I'm not entirely sure about this.. but aren't the drivers kernel modules? at least I think the nvidia driver is a kernel module
2008-05-23T03:43:00.000Z	Lanlost	Slart	bazhang keeps telling me I am being off-topic and to ask someone who knows about compiz
2008-05-23T03:43:00.000Z	Slart	Lanlost	bazhang is usually corrent.. I wouldn't dismiss his advice that quickly
2008-05-23T03:44:00.000Z	Slart	Lanlost	but run lsmod in a terminal and see what you get
2008-05-23T03:44:00.000Z	Lanlost	Slart	I've seen bazhang in here a lot. and I've seen him be correct almost all of the time
2008-05-23T03:45:00.000Z	Slart	Lanlost	I'm using the nvidia binary driver.. and I have one nvidia module "nvidia               8858052  44"
2008-05-23T03:45:00.000Z	Slart	Lanlost	afaik, yes
2008-05-23T03:46:00.000Z	Slart	Lanlost	but you'd have to check the man page to find out what the numbers mean
