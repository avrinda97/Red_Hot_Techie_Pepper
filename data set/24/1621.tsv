2009-11-01T07:47:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	ekianjo	what wireless device?
2009-11-01T07:47:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	ekianjo	well, there's a lot of atheros chipsets, which one
2009-11-01T07:48:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	ekianjo	lspci will show it i'd imagine
2009-11-01T07:50:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	ekianjo	are you using 32 or 64bit?.. i have that same device and it works out of the box, nothing required
2009-11-01T07:51:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	ekianjo	hmm, thats odd.
2009-11-01T07:52:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	ekianjo	i wouldn't think so, have you installed anything weird?
2009-11-01T07:53:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	ekianjo	i deny them by default
2009-11-01T07:54:00.000Z	ekianjo	IndyGunFreak	anything i can do to at least find out the issue ? any diagnostic tool ?
2009-11-01T07:54:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	ekianjo	not really sure.. you can try madwifi.
2009-11-01T07:55:00.000Z	ekianjo	IndyGunFreak	- madwifi drivers work on karmic ? in jaunty they didnt work for me at all
2009-11-01T07:55:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	ekianjo	i don't know, was just suggesting to have a look.. did the device work on the 9.10 live cd?.. or did you upgrade
2009-11-01T07:56:00.000Z	ekianjo	IndyGunFreak	actually i didn an upgrade at first but it screwed my system so i did a fresh 9.10 install after
2009-11-01T07:57:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	ekianjo	but did your wireless work on the live cd?
2009-11-01T07:57:00.000Z	ekianjo	IndyGunFreak	not sure whether the wireless worked out of the box, i stayed wired to reinstall all the softs i wanted first and that only after that i noticed i did not have wireless anymore
2009-11-01T07:58:00.000Z	ekianjo	IndyGunFreak	so you are saying i should try again the live cd and see if it works ?
2009-11-01T07:58:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	ekianjo	yes, boot the live CD, for 9.10.. and see if you have wireless
2009-11-01T07:59:00.000Z	ekianjo	IndyGunFreak	ok let me try that first ill come back here later
2009-11-01T08:01:00.000Z	ekianjo	IndyGunFreak	if live cd works for wifi what can i do to fix the issue ?
2009-11-01T08:01:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	ekianjo	well, now that i don't know.. unless you went off doing some weird crap(blacklisting, or something like that), your wireless should work, cuz like i said, i have that same device, and its working fine for me
2009-11-01T08:02:00.000Z	ekianjo	IndyGunFreak	no i did not do any blacklisting
2009-11-01T08:03:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	ekianjo	i'm not saying just blacklisting, i'm saying unless you installed something that disabled it somehow, its unlikely, but possible
2009-11-01T08:04:00.000Z	ekianjo	IndyGunFreak	i see... well let me check the live cd as said
