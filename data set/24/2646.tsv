2008-10-08T04:19:00.000Z	webas		why it is so difficult in linux to unrar unzip copy files and folders with many files :|
2008-10-08T04:19:00.000Z	LjL	webas	it is?
2008-10-08T04:20:00.000Z	LjL	webas	well, *i* do it via the terminal, *because* it can be much faster than any other way
2008-10-08T04:21:00.000Z	LjL	webas	if you aren't fond of that, i don't see what's wrong with file-roller (although being a KDE user, there might be a lot of things wrong with it that i don't know about)
2008-10-08T04:22:00.000Z	LjL	webas	wait, you're copying files into some place that you need root privileges to access? *why*?
2008-10-08T04:23:00.000Z	LjL	webas	and that's precisely, where? you do know you should never write outside of your home, /usr/local and /opt
2008-10-08T04:24:00.000Z	LjL	webas	anyway i don't see what makes it so slow. cd /directory/where/you/need/to/save ; sudo unrar x /path/and/file/to/the/rar/archive
2008-10-08T04:24:00.000Z	LjL	webas	there, done. and obviously you can use Tab to complete the pathnames, which makes that pretty fat.
2008-10-08T04:25:00.000Z	LjL	webas	no, you "must" not. you're doing something wrong if you are.
2008-10-08T04:26:00.000Z	LjL	webas	and why does playing quake3 involve writing to "forbidden" areas daily?
2008-10-08T04:27:00.000Z	LjL	webas	no, of course not. "~" means your home.
2008-10-08T04:28:00.000Z	LjL	webas	if you want to keep believing that, then keep beliving that. we're all telling you that you don't.
2008-10-08T04:32:00.000Z	LjL	webas	you can't see the . folders in Nautilus, the "." means precisely that they're hidden folders. you can see them in the shell, and you also should be able to point Nautilus to them if you type the name in.
2008-10-16T19:24:00.000Z	LjL	webas	you can also convert monkey's audio to other formats, but no program to do that is available in the repositories - you'd have to look somewhere on the web.
2008-10-16T19:24:00.000Z	LjL	webas	monkey's audio is proprietary, so the original decoder can't be included, and it's difficult to reverse engineer one
2008-10-16T19:25:00.000Z	LjL	webas	you should use something else - like FLAC - if at all possible
2008-12-11T23:43:00.000Z	LjL	webas	say again?
2008-12-11T23:44:00.000Z	LjL	webas	synaptic is always installed by default on an Ubuntu desktop install.
2008-12-11T23:44:00.000Z	LjL	webas	if you original question made no sense, and it didn't, others aren't to blame.
2008-12-11T23:46:00.000Z	LjL	webas	more or less. you have a non-networked computer, you have used the "Generate package download script" feature of Synaptic, and you want to transfer the resulting file to another computer?
2008-12-11T23:53:00.000Z	LjL	webas	so you need to install ndiswrapper-utils from the CD? you just need to put the CD in, type "sudo apt-cdrom add", and then type "sudo apt-get install ndiswrapper-utils"
2008-12-11T23:56:00.000Z	LjL	webas	i don't know. but i do know that Synaptic couldn't find any better than apt-get can
2008-12-11T23:57:00.000Z	webas	LjL	still wireless network list is empty :|
2008-12-11T23:57:00.000Z	LjL	webas	installing ndiswrapper is certainly not enough, you need to install the driver too
