2011-12-21T11:11:00.000Z	Captain_Crow		its happened every time i tried to run the cube feature
2011-12-21T11:13:00.000Z	Captain_Crow		all i had to do was install ccsm, run it, checkmark the cube feature, and after that EVERYTHING on the desktop would disappear and become unuseable, i even tried the Alt+F2 thing to bring up the command terminal and nothing would happen
2011-12-21T11:15:00.000Z	Captain_Crow		yes
2011-12-21T11:15:00.000Z	Captain_Crow		that was it
2011-12-21T11:16:00.000Z	Captain_Crow		the only other things in installed were the updates
2011-12-21T11:17:00.000Z	Captain_Crow		so i'd have to change the screen resolution?
