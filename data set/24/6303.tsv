2006-06-23T05:28:00.000Z	constantine-xvi		can anyone else apt-get update from any archive without getting a bunch of 403s?
2006-06-23T05:28:00.000Z	LjL	constantine-xvi	sure
2006-06-23T05:28:00.000Z	constantine-xvi	LjL	which archive?
2006-06-23T05:29:00.000Z	LjL	constantine-xvi	a mixture of the french and italian ones, currently
2006-06-26T05:15:00.000Z	LjL	constantine-xvi	which repositories are you using?
2006-06-26T05:16:00.000Z	LjL	constantine-xvi	i mean with mirrors. try using some others
2006-06-26T05:16:00.000Z	LjL	constantine-xvi	s/with/which/
2006-06-26T05:16:00.000Z	constantine-xvi	LjL	tried us.archive, archive, se.archive, among others, but not working
2006-06-26T05:16:00.000Z	LjL	constantine-xvi	do you have a (DSL) router?
2006-06-26T05:17:00.000Z	constantine-xvi	LjL	yes
2006-06-26T05:17:00.000Z	LjL	constantine-xvi	look at your /etc/resolv.conf -- is your router set as the DNS server?
2006-06-26T05:18:00.000Z	constantine-xvi	LjL	nameserver 192.168.0.1 (the router)
2006-06-26T05:18:00.000Z	LjL	constantine-xvi	right. try changing that into 212.245.255.2, and then try again the apt-get update
2006-06-26T05:18:00.000Z	LjL	constantine-xvi	(that IP's a DNS server that i know works)
2006-06-26T05:19:00.000Z	constantine-xvi	LjL	still 403s
2006-06-26T05:20:00.000Z	constantine-xvi	LjL	if i copy/paste the urls into firefox, i get the lists
2006-06-26T05:20:00.000Z	LjL	constantine-xvi	hmm, ok. i'll explain why i asked you to do this --- some guy had encountered a problem with 403s and other errors on apt-get, due to the fact that his router model messed up DNS when requests came too fast. that's why i had you try another server
2006-06-26T05:20:00.000Z	LjL	constantine-xvi	can you paste both your sources.list and the errors you're getting from apt-get update to the pastebin?
2006-06-26T05:21:00.000Z	constantine-xvi	LjL	please hold...
2006-06-26T05:27:00.000Z	constantine-xvi	LjL	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16489
2006-06-26T05:29:00.000Z	LjL	constantine-xvi	well, i can confirm that your sources.list works for me
2006-06-26T05:31:00.000Z	LjL	constantine-xvi	i've seen that man ;-) i'm looking at it, as i said, it works for me, and i'm not sure what could be wrong
2006-06-26T05:32:00.000Z	constantine-xvi	LjL	my bad, was gutting another machine for something else
2006-06-26T05:36:00.000Z	LjL	constantine-xvi	well, i can honestly say i don't have a clue. you should probably purge/clean your list of packages, but i don't know and can't find the right command for that.
