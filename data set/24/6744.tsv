2005-11-04T08:56:00.000Z	thesilentkiller		how do i start OpenOffice with root access?
2005-11-04T08:57:00.000Z	thoreauputic	thesilentkiller	what on earth for?
2005-11-04T08:57:00.000Z	thesilentkiller	thoreauputic	it is not able to save files in my home directory :-s
2005-11-04T08:58:00.000Z	thoreauputic	thesilentkiller	that won't be solved by saving as root- you won't be able to access your files as user
2005-11-04T08:58:00.000Z	thesilentkiller	thoreauputic	so i chmod recursively and change the permission level?
2005-11-04T08:58:00.000Z	thoreauputic	thesilentkiller	you have some kind of permissions problem
2005-11-04T08:59:00.000Z	thoreauputic	thesilentkiller	erm - who owns your $HOME dir ?
2005-11-04T08:59:00.000Z	thesilentkiller	thoreauputic	even from a terminal, i had the same problem. mkdir didnt work. i had to sudo mkdir
2005-11-04T08:59:00.000Z	thesilentkiller	thoreauputic	how do i find out who owns my $HOME? :-?
2005-11-04T08:59:00.000Z	thoreauputic	thesilentkiller	 what does  ls -ld  /home/youruser  say ?
2005-11-04T08:59:00.000Z	thesilentkiller	thoreauputic	that gives my name. the name in which i am logged in now
2005-11-04T09:00:00.000Z	thoreauputic	thesilentkiller	show us the output please
2005-11-04T09:01:00.000Z	thesilentkiller	thoreauputic	drwxr-xr-x  31 silent silent 4096 2005-10-30 08:47 /home/silent/
2005-11-04T09:01:00.000Z	thoreauputic	thesilentkiller	OK looks normal
2005-11-04T09:02:00.000Z	thoreauputic	thesilentkiller	can you save other files ? For instance do you get an error if you run " touch foo" in your home dir ?
2005-11-04T09:03:00.000Z	thesilentkiller	thoreauputic	actually, i am able to create directories normally in my home directory. but in a deeper place /home/silent/a/b/c, i have problem. i can only create a directory with sudo
2005-11-04T09:03:00.000Z	thoreauputic	thesilentkiller	odd
2005-11-04T09:03:00.000Z	thesilentkiller	thoreauputic	and an ls -l on that directory returns drwxr-xr-x
2005-11-04T09:04:00.000Z	thoreauputic	thesilentkiller	does this apply to all directories ? Or only some?
2005-11-04T09:05:00.000Z	thoreauputic	thesilentkiller	ah - so sudo chown -R silent:silent
2005-11-04T09:07:00.000Z	thesilentkiller	thoreauputic	lsuactiafner: chown did it for me. now things work fine. thanks guys
2005-11-04T09:07:00.000Z	thoreauputic	thesilentkiller	yw :)
2005-11-04T09:08:00.000Z	thesilentkiller	thoreauputic	i am going to become an Ubuntu propagandizer (is there such a word?), just for the sheer power of its IRC room
2005-11-04T09:08:00.000Z	thoreauputic	thesilentkiller	heheh :)
