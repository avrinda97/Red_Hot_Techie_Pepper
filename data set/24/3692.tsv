2008-02-03T00:41:00.000Z	Xintruder		hi
2008-02-03T00:41:00.000Z	Xintruder		I cannot enable extra effects, why? (Appearance)
2008-02-03T00:42:00.000Z	Xintruder		I just get a message: Cannot enable...
2008-02-03T00:42:00.000Z	rinaldi_	Xintruder	you need to enable extra plugins for compiz fusion, go to synaptic and search it
2008-02-03T00:43:00.000Z	Xintruder	rinaldi_	How?
2008-02-03T00:43:00.000Z	rinaldi_	Xintruder	go to system > administration > synaptic package manager, and do a search
2008-02-03T00:44:00.000Z	rinaldi_	Xintruder	compiz-fusion-plugins extra
2008-02-03T00:47:00.000Z	rinaldi_	Xintruder	also install compizconfig-settings-manager so you can customise effects
2008-02-03T00:49:00.000Z	Xintruder	rinaldi_	I just wasted my time. I still get: Desktop effects could not be enabled
2008-02-03T00:49:00.000Z	rinaldi_	Xintruder	have you made sure your graphics card drivers are installed?
2008-02-03T00:54:00.000Z	Xintruder	rinaldi_	Im sorry if my comment didn't seem polite. I meant no offence. As to the graphic card I did nothing manually. All auto detected.
2008-02-03T00:55:00.000Z	rinaldi_	Xintruder	well what graphics card have you got if any?
2008-02-03T00:55:00.000Z	Xintruder	rinaldi_	I belive its built in intel
2008-02-03T00:57:00.000Z	rinaldi_	Xintruder	if you go "administration"> restricted drivers manager see if it detects anything
2008-02-03T00:57:00.000Z	rinaldi_	Xintruder	but if its built in then it shouldnt really need extra drivers i dont think
2008-02-03T00:57:00.000Z	Xintruder	rinaldi_	Atheros HAL (Enabled).
2008-02-03T00:58:00.000Z	rinaldi_	Xintruder	in appearance are you only not able to enable "extra" or can you enable "normal"?
2008-02-03T00:59:00.000Z	Xintruder	rinaldi_	I cannot enable normal too
2008-02-03T01:00:00.000Z	rinaldi_	Xintruder	 i get this in my laptop because my onboard graphics can't handle the effects, but if your pc is fairly new-ish, then it should be able to... you may need to find someone about drivers. not quite my area
2008-02-03T01:01:00.000Z	Xintruder	rinaldi_	well thanks man for your help. Im sure I will find something.
2008-02-03T01:03:00.000Z	rinaldi_	Xintruder	if you can give me the model of the onboard card i could try and find it, go to preferences > hardware information
2008-02-03T01:29:00.000Z	Xintruder	rinaldi_	82865G Integrated Graphics Controller There you go!
2008-02-03T01:37:00.000Z	rinaldi_	Xintruder	i can't really find much on that card. have you tried asking in #compiz-fusion?
2008-02-03T01:37:00.000Z	Xintruder	rinaldi_	just got there.
