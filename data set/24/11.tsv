2005-02-03T07:47:00.000Z	jdub	giard	normal bugzilla
2005-02-10T11:03:00.000Z	jdub	giard	and yours?
2005-02-10T11:02:00.000Z	jdub	giard	ok
2005-02-10T10:59:00.000Z	giard	jdub	yes
2005-02-10T10:59:00.000Z	jdub	giard	res?
2005-02-10T10:59:00.000Z	giard	jdub	1920x1200
2005-02-10T11:00:00.000Z	giard	jdub	sure thing
2005-02-10T11:02:00.000Z	giard	jdub	The labels are okay, but the place where you type in the name uses small fonts
2005-02-10T11:03:00.000Z	giard	jdub	75x75 dots per inch
2005-02-10T11:04:00.000Z	jdub	giard	do you believe that? :)
2005-02-10T11:04:00.000Z	giard	jdub	ummm, is that a trick question? ;-)
2005-02-10T11:04:00.000Z	jdub	giard	do you really believe that your screen is 75dpi at that resolution? :)
2005-02-10T11:05:00.000Z	giard	jdub	never thought about it
2005-02-10T11:05:00.000Z	jdub	giard	is it 25x16 inches? :)
2005-02-10T11:05:00.000Z	giard	jdub	for a 15" widescreen to be at 1920x1200...
2005-02-10T11:06:00.000Z	giard	jdub	is there a way to fix that?
2005-02-10T11:06:00.000Z	jdub	giard	you can set it in your x configuration; for some reason X can't determine it from the monitor
2005-02-10T11:07:00.000Z	giard	jdub	so is it a configuration-specific problem?
2005-02-10T11:17:00.000Z	giard	jdub	wow!  Fixed the screen size made a world of difference
2005-02-10T11:18:00.000Z	giard	jdub	should 75x75 be fixed by maybe asking the user what size screen it is (15", 17", etc) if it can't tell what the dpi is?
