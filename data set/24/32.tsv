2012-10-27T03:22:00.000Z	PatrickDickey	david_	in your dmesg, look for one of two things. Look for Connexant or video0 (could be video with another number also).
2012-10-27T03:32:00.000Z	PatrickDickey	david_	one suggestion that I have is to check http://www.linuxtv.org and search through their documentation (also search their mailing list archives). It *should* work, as it's using a Connexant chip (which is used in Hauppauge cards also), but that's not a guarantee.
2012-10-27T03:33:00.000Z	PatrickDickey	david_	this might get you closer http://www.linuxtv.org/wiki/index.php/Cx88_devices_(cx2388x)
2012-10-27T03:38:00.000Z	PatrickDickey	david_	it might just be that no one has tested the card with the linuxtv subsystem.
2012-10-27T03:39:00.000Z	PatrickDickey	david_	that's because they haven't created a driver for it yet. Or they haven't put it into the cardlist yet.
2012-10-27T03:41:00.000Z	PatrickDickey	david_	try 86 It has the same device id as your card.
2012-10-27T03:52:00.000Z	PatrickDickey	david_	Your best bet is to subscribe to the linux-media mailing list, and ask there. They'll know whether your card works with linux or not (and how to specify the card= for it, if it does).
2012-10-27T03:52:00.000Z	PatrickDickey	david_	the link to subscribe will be on the linuxtv.org site I gave you earlier.
2012-10-27T04:09:00.000Z	PatrickDickey	david_	I'd say the second one looks right. Or it might need a space between insmod and card. I'll look for the right syntax.
2012-10-27T04:16:00.000Z	PatrickDickey	david_	to verify this, put lspci -vnn into the terminal, and just paste the line that shows the name of the card. It'll  have "05:01.0 Multimedia video controller: Conexant Systems, Inc. CX23880/1/2/3 PCI Video and Audio Decoder (rev 05)" in it
2012-10-27T04:17:00.000Z	PatrickDickey	david_	Specifically the last portion [xxxx:xxxx]
2012-10-27T04:23:00.000Z	PatrickDickey	david_	you're going to need to ask on the mailing list (linuxtv.org). Give them that information, along with whatever is underneath it.
2012-10-27T04:26:00.000Z	PatrickDickey	david_	you'll get to that point before you know it. The only reason I know anything about their list is I've been trying to get a USB TV Tuner working for a couple of years now. It works, but the code isn't styled right, so they won't include it.
