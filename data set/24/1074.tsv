2010-07-31T08:53:00.000Z	hylian		i can't wrap my head around debian's website. so many packages. i want something that says, oh you want this this and this. not, ohh, here's a million possible packages, and you figure it out.
2010-07-31T08:55:00.000Z	hylian		cast i like choice, and i like direction. a city like los angeles and no road map = chaotic.
2010-07-31T08:57:00.000Z	hylian		cast maybe you can help me then. i have an interest in debian, i want to start with a functional gui desktop os. where in debian.org do i begin?
2010-07-31T08:59:00.000Z	hylian		cast but that requires more bandwidth than i have. i download iso's from my library and then use them at home. i need something i can have totally ready and available without reconnecting to the net and downloading for 7 hours before i get everything installed. debian should make a ubuntu-ish desktop cd with most used software ready to go.
2010-07-31T08:59:00.000Z	smackmanic	hylian	it really is much friendly than you'd think..just you have to get used to not using synaptic and such. that's my opinion. I use it for sound editing because as I said, ubuntu devs took it upon themselves to edit software so that id have to import a 300mb wav sample while I have 5 VSTi's open and CPU maxin out
2010-07-31T09:04:00.000Z	smackmanic	hylian	it def already has, for sure
2010-07-31T09:05:00.000Z	hylian	smackmanic	are you still having grub problems? does grub not load when you install? i had that problem because i am using both an ati drive and a sata drive
2010-07-31T09:06:00.000Z	smackmanic	hylian	grub loads, ubuntu won't boot
2010-07-31T09:07:00.000Z	hylian	smackmanic	is it giving you an error, what exactly is it doing?
2010-07-31T09:07:00.000Z	smackmanic	hylian	when you jump from 8.04 to the latest ver it messes with your boot options. some weird bug that they haven't taken out
2010-07-31T09:09:00.000Z	hylian	smackmanic	this should not happen, but i have seen it one time before (don't ask me how) but the uuid changed when i went from ubu 6 to ubu 8.
2010-07-31T09:10:00.000Z	smackmanic	hylian	yeah..seems to be a jump update bug, reccurring, just like me sound modules ;)
2010-07-31T09:10:00.000Z	hylian	smackmanic	have another os you can check the uuid with?
2010-07-31T09:10:00.000Z	hylian	smackmanic	what happens when you use the generic drive "name" instead, like /dev/sdb1/ ?
2010-07-31T09:11:00.000Z	smackmanic	hylian	i get errors...i think i'm just doing something incorrectly tho
2010-07-31T09:12:00.000Z	hylian	smackmanic	maybe fstab is screwed up? i had that problem before. an ugly fix is to boot from the ubuntu cd and then copy over the cd's fstab. but it works.
2010-07-31T09:13:00.000Z	smackmanic	hylian	right, the issue is that this machine does not have enough space for the livecd nor do I have blanks atm
2010-07-31T09:13:00.000Z	hylian	smackmanic	dang. heh, if i was ther i would you damn small linux, cause once it's booted you can remove the cd. lol.
2010-07-31T09:14:00.000Z	smackmanic	hylian	lol DSL ftw
2010-07-31T09:14:00.000Z	hylian	smackmanic	i dont know waht ftw means.
2010-07-31T09:14:00.000Z	smackmanic	hylian	for the win.
2010-07-31T09:17:00.000Z	hylian	smackmanic	i am assuming you tried restoring grub?
2010-07-31T09:17:00.000Z	smackmanic	hylian	nah uh, I can't update or install anything in this shape..
2010-07-31T09:20:00.000Z	smackmanic	hylian	I have a question you could probably answer
