2007-04-23T14:48:00.000Z	magnetron	shirish	use the "users" tool in system > adminitration
2007-04-23T14:50:00.000Z	shirish	magnetron	I don't want to add a user, I want to change an application to the existing user
2007-04-23T14:51:00.000Z	magnetron	shirish	do that by accessing the system > administration > "users and groups"
2007-04-23T14:51:00.000Z	shirish	magnetron	ok, how?
2007-04-23T14:52:00.000Z	shirish	magnetron	I have my user there?
2007-04-23T14:52:00.000Z	magnetron	shirish	select the user (yourself?), change properties, advanced tab
2007-04-23T14:54:00.000Z	shirish	magnetron	that one is done, now how about if I wanted to do the same for java as well as for flash & for couple of other things ?
2007-04-23T14:54:00.000Z	magnetron	shirish	you mean prefered applications?
2007-04-23T14:55:00.000Z	shirish	magnetron	preferred applications only shows browser & email & couple of things more, not much in there
2007-04-23T14:56:00.000Z	magnetron	shirish	to change the prefered application for a file type, right click a file of that type and choose "properties" (the bottom choice)
2007-04-23T14:57:00.000Z	shirish	magnetron	ok thanx, will try that :)
2007-04-23T14:57:00.000Z	magnetron	shirish	you are welcome
2007-04-23T15:09:00.000Z	shirish	magnetron	what u said before is good for let's say doing a .doc from openoffice.org to abiword & vice-versa but I mean something like explicitly using gcj for openoffice.org as well as for firefox or using gnash/swfdec for mozilla firefox. How to do that?
2007-04-23T15:10:00.000Z	magnetron	shirish	you have too configure each application respectively, fx and OO.org
2007-04-23T15:11:00.000Z	shirish	magnetron	how now a java applet would be on the web, how I can say to firefox don't use Sun java use the GNU java ?
2007-04-23T15:13:00.000Z	magnetron	shirish	in synaptic, there is several packages for fx java plugins. make sure only your preferred one is installed
2007-04-23T15:14:00.000Z	shirish	magnetron	I wanted so I can change, choose between them, seems there isn't a way :(
2007-04-23T15:14:00.000Z	magnetron	shirish	there should be some config in fx too
2007-04-23T15:17:00.000Z	magnetron	shirish	there is a OS, haiku under development where this isn't an issue. it is a different kind of computing paradigm
2007-04-23T15:17:00.000Z	shirish	magnetron	link about haiku please?
2007-04-23T15:18:00.000Z	magnetron	shirish	http://haiku-os.org/  it is still in alpha though (or even pre-alpha)
2007-04-27T12:36:00.000Z	shirish	magnetron	that's a cool trick to know
2007-04-27T12:37:00.000Z	shirish	magnetron	do u know anything how the partition behaves if it sees an ntfs partition, would it over-write or not to make an ext3 partition?
2007-07-16T07:45:00.000Z	magnetron	shirish	with synaptic package manager, search for the package and uninstall it
