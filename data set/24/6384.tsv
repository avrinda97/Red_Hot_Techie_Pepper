2006-03-03T07:20:00.000Z	Ekushey		hi, i've a samba question... can anyone help?
2006-03-03T07:20:00.000Z	Ekushey		i've set a static ip (203.190.1.xxx) on my linux box, and now i can't access the shared folder from windows
2006-03-03T07:21:00.000Z	Ekushey		before, the ip was 192.168.1.5, and it use to work perfectly
2006-03-03T07:21:00.000Z	Ekushey		what to do now?
2006-03-03T07:21:00.000Z	Seveas	Ekushey	well duh
2006-03-03T07:21:00.000Z	Seveas	Ekushey	you can't simply use any ip address
2006-03-03T07:21:00.000Z	Seveas	Ekushey	192.168.*.* and 10.*.*.* are safe for private use
2006-03-03T07:22:00.000Z	Ekushey	Seveas	i'm using the linux box as my ftp server as well... therefor i had to put real ip
2006-03-03T07:24:00.000Z	Ekushey	Seveas	bro, help me out please!
2006-03-03T07:24:00.000Z	Seveas	Ekushey	you can't use that ip behind a router. Point.
2006-03-03T07:25:00.000Z	Ekushey	Seveas	u mean i need to use 192.168.x.x type of ip address?
2006-03-03T07:25:00.000Z	Seveas	Ekushey	yes
2006-03-03T07:27:00.000Z	Ekushey	Seveas	how i do the forwarding stuffs?
2006-03-03T07:27:00.000Z	Seveas	Ekushey	read your routers documentation
2006-03-03T07:28:00.000Z	Ekushey	Seveas	i need it use a as a ftp server as well so that ppl from outside can store their files... if i don't put a "real" ip on the machine, then outside world ppl can't access it
2006-03-03T07:28:00.000Z	Ekushey	Seveas	do u get my scenario?
2006-03-03T07:28:00.000Z	Seveas	Ekushey	read the docs for your ftp server (and let people use PORT instead of PASV)
2006-03-03T07:30:00.000Z	Ekushey	Seveas	ok thanks...
2006-03-06T06:03:00.000Z	Seveas	Ekushey	loook for "signature" in the apache config
2006-03-06T06:03:00.000Z	Ekushey	Seveas	ok thanks
2006-03-06T06:03:00.000Z	Ekushey	Seveas	is it apache2.conf?
2006-03-06T06:04:00.000Z	Seveas	Ekushey	/etc/apache/*
2006-03-06T06:06:00.000Z	Ekushey	Seveas	i got only one file with the text "ServerSignature On"
2006-03-06T06:08:00.000Z	Ekushey	Seveas	apache in ubuntu is so strange!
