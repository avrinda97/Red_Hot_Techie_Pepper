2005-08-22T14:31:00.000Z	PurpleMotion		oh and it runs (with active use) for eight hours on a charge (no moving parts)
2005-08-22T14:33:00.000Z	PurpleMotion		X connection to :0.0 broken (explicit kill or server shutdown).
2005-08-22T14:33:00.000Z	PurpleMotion		535 frames in 5.0 seconds = 107.000 FPS
2005-08-22T14:33:00.000Z	PurpleMotion		557 frames in 5.0 seconds = 111.400 FPS
2005-08-22T14:33:00.000Z	PurpleMotion		heh
2005-08-22T14:33:00.000Z	PurpleMotion		but that was fgl_glxgears
2005-08-22T14:33:00.000Z	PurpleMotion		I use gaim (not in irc though)
2005-08-22T14:34:00.000Z	PurpleMotion		who knows
2005-08-22T14:34:00.000Z	PurpleMotion		i dont use gnome ;)
2005-08-22T14:35:00.000Z	EdLin	PurpleMotion	not using GNOME in Ubuntu is kind of strange. ;-)
2005-08-22T14:37:00.000Z	PurpleMotion	EdLin	 KDE in Ubuntu us perfectly normal, it's called kubuntu-desktop
2005-08-22T14:38:00.000Z	EdLin	PurpleMotion	true.
2005-08-22T14:38:00.000Z	EdLin	PurpleMotion	part of what makes Ubuntu special though is the GNOME (and KDE) features it has that other distros don't. If you're running fluxbox on Ubuntu all the time you might as well use vanilla Debian.
2005-08-22T14:40:00.000Z	PurpleMotion	EdLin	 except the maintenance on debian is horrific to put it mildly.. I use K/Ubuntu for two main reasons, 1) it's updated on a regular schedule, and 2) the people in this channel right here
2005-08-22T14:40:00.000Z	PurpleMotion	EdLin	 even ubuntu's xfce system is updated more than debians
2005-08-22T14:41:00.000Z	PurpleMotion	EdLin	 you see my screenshots?
2005-08-22T14:41:00.000Z	EdLin	PurpleMotion	no, what's the URL?
2005-08-22T14:41:00.000Z	PurpleMotion	EdLin	 http://www.daede.com/2x3Desktop.jpg && http://www.daede.com/Jornada690.jpg
2005-08-22T14:44:00.000Z	EdLin	PurpleMotion	nice screenies
2005-08-22T14:44:00.000Z	PurpleMotion	EdLin	 tyvm
2005-08-22T14:45:00.000Z	PurpleMotion	EdLin	 I've since changed window decorations to something a little flatter that matches the schema a little better, but other than that, it's my current desktop
2005-08-22T14:46:00.000Z	EdLin	PurpleMotion	I'm just using clearlooks with a background from gnome-backgrounds.
2005-08-22T14:47:00.000Z	PurpleMotion	EdLin	 clearlooks is pretty
2005-08-22T14:48:00.000Z	EdLin	PurpleMotion	me too. :)
