2010-09-30T20:25:00.000Z	ksbalaji		im using livecd 10.04 I have installed in hdd but does not boot.(dual boot with win7) Any help booting 10.4 in hard disk?
2010-09-30T20:26:00.000Z	Copernic	ksbalaji	did you install win7 first ?
2010-09-30T20:26:00.000Z	ksbalaji		krishphillips, I do not remember. I installed from this live cd. Probably yes.
2010-09-30T20:26:00.000Z	ksbalaji		copernic I installed win7 first.
2010-09-30T20:27:00.000Z	ksbalaji		krishphillips hey this tab autofill thing does not work in livecd. ok I installed win7 first.
2010-09-30T20:28:00.000Z	Copernic	ksbalaji	hmmz, strange, you need to fix your grub installation,  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows
2010-09-30T20:28:00.000Z	ksbalaji		krishphi... I partitioned leaving free space with win7 then partitioned again freespace with gpart.
2010-09-30T20:29:00.000Z	ksbalaji		copernic I shall see that
2010-09-30T20:29:00.000Z	Copernic	ksbalaji	wait, I'm looking for some more easy tutorial
2010-09-30T20:32:00.000Z	Copernic	ksbalaji	do you get an error or does it just plainly start win7?
2010-09-30T20:37:00.000Z	Copernic	ksbalaji	I think this is what you need http://www.webupd8.org/2009/12/how-to-recover-grub2-linux.html
2010-09-30T20:37:00.000Z	Copernic		I'm trying to play enemy territory, but my sound doesnt work, I changed the sound dev from /dev/dsp to /dev/adsp, but now it says it's muted :(
2010-09-30T20:38:00.000Z	Copernic		with /dev/dsp ET said it was busy, isn't this a multi channel device ?
2010-09-30T20:39:00.000Z	ksbalaji		copernic, sorry for delay I was reading the site. now, my boot straight goes to win7. I do not get any error. The MBR is a good win7 controlled. I also disabled lucid from tampering MBR. however, I think I redirected the GRUB boot record to be written in its partition itself.
2010-09-30T20:41:00.000Z	Copernic	ksbalaji	you need grub to boot from linux, so you have to alter the MBR or make a boot disk maybe
2010-09-30T20:42:00.000Z	Copernic	ksbalaji	anyways if you follow that last tutorial, which is streight to the point, you shouldnt have any problems
2010-09-30T20:45:00.000Z	Copernic	ksbalaji	dont be scared to let grub controle the MBR, you can always reverse it by booting from the win7 cd and get the console and type fixmbr
2010-09-30T20:47:00.000Z	Copernic	ksbalaji	oh wait it has changed, to reverse a grub install do this: http://www.ehow.com/how_4836283_repair-mbr-windows.html
2010-09-30T20:48:00.000Z	Copernic	ksbalaji	but now you can do this : http://www.webupd8.org/2009/12/how-to-recover-grub2-linux.html :)
2010-09-30T20:49:00.000Z	Copernic		!alsa
2010-09-30T20:53:00.000Z	Copernic		what audio device should I use for games since /dev/dsp is busy ?
2010-09-30T21:05:00.000Z	Copernic		what audio device should I use for games since /dev/dsp is busy/not working ?
2010-09-30T21:51:00.000Z	ksbalaji	Copernic	thanks for all the effort to help me. I am getting the installation fixed soon. and bye for now.
2010-09-30T21:53:00.000Z	Copernic	ksbalaji	np, pay it forward ;-)
