2007-01-17T13:12:00.000Z	Trunkz		The ubuntu site has some awkward mirrors (china.. japan.. israel.. )
2007-01-17T13:13:00.000Z	Trunkz		nameless, I have 6.06
2007-01-17T13:13:00.000Z	Trunkz		installed on vmware
2007-01-17T13:13:00.000Z	Trunkz		I want to do a fresh install however :p
2007-01-17T13:14:00.000Z	Trunkz		I know that method.. I dont want to do it
2007-01-17T13:14:00.000Z	Trunkz		breaks alot of the stuff on the system :p
2007-01-17T13:15:00.000Z	Robbster	Trunkz	Use http://www.ubuntu.com/products/GetUbuntu/download?action=show&redirect=download, select the mirror you want and then download the "ubuntu-6.06.1-alternate-i386.iso   "
2007-01-17T13:15:00.000Z	Trunkz		The iso file is big (600MB+)
2007-01-17T13:15:00.000Z	Trunkz		I only want the netimage file, then I just download files off the webhost
2007-01-17T13:15:00.000Z	Robbster		humm, now that I think aout it there is another image somewhere.
2007-01-17T13:16:00.000Z	Trunkz		cheers :p
2007-01-17T13:16:00.000Z	Robbster	Trunkz	I seem to recall that it is in the alternates CD.

2007-01-17T13:17:00.000Z	Trunkz		The image file I used awhile back was around.. 8MB
2007-01-17T13:17:00.000Z	Trunkz		not 600MB :P
2007-01-17T13:17:00.000Z	Robbster		yeah - I know what you are after.
