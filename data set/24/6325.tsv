2005-11-10T11:09:00.000Z	holycow		just ask, if someone knows they will answer
2005-11-10T11:09:00.000Z	holycow		forget trolling
2005-11-10T11:11:00.000Z	frogzoo	holycow	or just open 20 virtual desktops :)
2005-11-10T11:12:00.000Z	holycow	frogzoo	lol
2005-12-06T08:46:00.000Z	holycow	frogzoo	wtf are you smoking
2005-12-06T08:47:00.000Z	frogzoo	holycow	for just the standard stuff, breezy is very nice
2006-08-03T09:43:00.000Z	frogzoo	holycow	if there's a fast repo today, they're keeping it to themselves...
2006-12-23T14:03:00.000Z	frogzoo	holycow	ibm is very behind linux
2006-12-23T14:04:00.000Z	holycow	frogzoo	total bullshit.  they support it as long as you are willing to pay $150 / hr for global services they offer
2006-12-23T14:04:00.000Z	frogzoo	holycow	dude, you've not right to be both dismissive and course :p
2006-12-23T14:06:00.000Z	frogzoo	holycow	ibm have a serious prolinux agenda, if they're not delivering to a standard you like at the moment, it's the business, not the politics
2006-12-23T14:07:00.000Z	holycow	frogzoo	ibm really have bought into linux but i deal with them.  its all just a bunch of bull to sell their global services at $150 / hr
2006-12-23T14:07:00.000Z	holycow	frogzoo	you won't be getting anything but a server with linux installed on it from them
2006-12-23T14:27:00.000Z	frogzoo	holycow	if I could buy online a linux laptop, that would be where I'd go, but it's a hard call, because buyers would expect _everything_ to work, and work out of the box
2006-12-23T14:28:00.000Z	frogzoo	holycow	and even then, there would be the 2nd wave of people trying to connect their laptops into the corporate doze network
2006-12-23T14:29:00.000Z	holycow	frogzoo	that wouldn't be an issue at all
2006-12-23T14:29:00.000Z	frogzoo	holycow	you mean h/w support, or the doze lan ?
2006-12-23T14:30:00.000Z	frogzoo	holycow	for instance, there's no good ntlm agent for linux
2006-12-23T14:30:00.000Z	holycow	frogzoo	anyone that  needs that should either complain to their sysadmin or stay on windows.
2006-12-23T14:30:00.000Z	frogzoo	holycow	2nd, evolution's support for exchange is hairy
2006-12-23T14:31:00.000Z	frogzoo	holycow	and then there's syncing to pocketpcs, it's a very grey area
2006-12-23T14:32:00.000Z	holycow	frogzoo	my feeling is to put together a company that sells all stuff that either 'just works' on linux or 'just works' in a cross platform way
2007-02-02T14:02:00.000Z	holycow	frogzoo	well you can throw ubuntu cds at the windshield
2007-02-02T14:38:00.000Z	frogzoo	holycow	wireshark?
