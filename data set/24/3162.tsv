2008-04-18T11:10:00.000Z	Bidget	hti_pro	wonderfully
2008-04-18T11:10:00.000Z	hti_pro	Bidget	no sh$^, I am gonna have to try it.  Did you have to do any special tweaking of wine
2008-04-18T11:10:00.000Z	Bidget	hti_pro	it was running at like 20fps until I found out I had to run it in directx 8
2008-04-18T11:10:00.000Z	Bidget		and then bam like 90fps
2008-04-18T11:11:00.000Z	Bidget		runs great
2008-04-18T11:11:00.000Z	hti_pro	Bidget	hell yeah, what kind of hardware are you running
2008-04-18T11:11:00.000Z	hti_pro		hey guys need help with a script, I need a bash script to remove an entry in a dhcpd.conf file identified by the hostname
2008-04-18T11:11:00.000Z	Bidget		8800gt, athlon x2 5000+ black edition, 2gb ocz pc2-6400
2008-04-18T11:12:00.000Z	hti_pro	Bidget	how did it compare to running on XP, or have you ran it on XP
2008-04-18T11:12:00.000Z	Bidget	hti_pro	definitely not as good as xp
2008-04-18T11:12:00.000Z	Bidget	hti_pro	but still great
2008-04-18T11:13:00.000Z	Bidget	hti_pro	directx 8 doesn't look as good, and I couldnt use aa or af
2008-04-18T11:13:00.000Z	hti_pro	Bidget	I have a bit less hardware,  P4 celeron 2GHz 768MB Ram
2008-04-18T11:13:00.000Z	Bidget		I think you'd probably be ok though you might as well give it a shot
2008-04-18T11:13:00.000Z	hti_pro	Bidget	i should probably wait till I can upgrade a little bit
2008-04-18T11:13:00.000Z	Bidget		if you are feeling like installing it I can tell you what parameters to use or something and it should run, although it seems like nothing is as easy as it sounds with linux
2008-04-18T11:13:00.000Z	hti_pro	Bidget	I will probably try it out
2008-04-18T11:13:00.000Z	hti_pro	Bidget	nothing to lose
2008-04-18T11:14:00.000Z	Bidget	hti_pro	exactly :D
2008-04-18T11:14:00.000Z	hti_pro	Bidget	Alright, I'm not gonna take it on right now, but I got you on my buddy list so I will probably hit you up sometime
2008-04-18T11:15:00.000Z	hti_pro		anyone good with bash scripting
2008-04-18T11:15:00.000Z	Bidget	hti_pro	cool
