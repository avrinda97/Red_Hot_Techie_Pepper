2005-12-10T10:34:00.000Z	atrolinux		are there any ftp servers in the universe/multiverse?
2005-12-10T10:34:00.000Z	levander	atrolinux	you've tried 'apt-cache search ftp'?
2005-12-10T10:35:00.000Z	atrolinux	levander	indeed, and it appears that everything with ftp in it is installed.  Also, i have repositories enabled that aren't multiverse/universe and I'm trying to stick to something supported if possible.
2005-12-10T10:35:00.000Z	levander	atrolinux	so, you want something *not* in universe/multiverse?
2005-12-10T10:36:00.000Z	atrolinux	levander	no, I want something in it.  I just haven't noticed anything suitable that is in it.  Just asking if there is something.
2005-12-10T10:37:00.000Z	levander	atrolinux	universe/multiverse are not supported, do you want something supported, or something not supported?
2005-12-10T10:37:00.000Z	levander	atrolinux	the only reason you'd want something supported is if you have something commercial that people's livelihoods depend upon
2005-12-10T10:37:00.000Z	atrolinux	levander	as supported as possible ;)
2005-12-10T10:37:00.000Z	levander	atrolinux	then you don't want universe/multiverse
2005-12-10T10:37:00.000Z	atrolinux	levander	I don't have a problem using something not supported, it just seems like a good idea to avoid it if I can, no?
2005-12-10T10:38:00.000Z	levander	atrolinux	it doesn't really matter, there is a slight advantage in that ubuntu recommends things and so they'll do things like configure them better by default, maybe integrate them more into other things
2005-12-10T10:39:00.000Z	levander	atrolinux	if i don't like one of the 'official ubuntu recommended apps' i don't hesitate not to use it
2005-12-10T10:39:00.000Z	levander	atrolinux	like i use grip instead of sound-juicer
2005-12-10T10:39:00.000Z	atrolinux	levander	right.  Is there a supported ftp server then?  If not, is there one in universe/multiverse?  What's a good ftp server elsewhere?   ... yeah, I use grip instead too
2005-12-10T10:41:00.000Z	levander	atrolinux	i'm looking
2005-12-10T10:42:00.000Z	levander	atrolinux	i'm looking, sec
2005-12-10T10:47:00.000Z	levander	atrolinux	vsftpd is in main (i think), but i've never heard of it before.  one quick thing, you've considered just using openssh, and making people sftp into your site?
2005-12-10T10:48:00.000Z	atrolinux	levander	it's a laptop, the ftp server is just for easily tranferring files.  security is not a primary concern.  vsftpd was recommended before, but I am not seeing that in main
2005-12-10T10:50:00.000Z	levander	atrolinux	you'll need sshd for connecting remotely to the box anyway, it's not a question of security really, it's just that ssh is more and more of a common way to communicate remotely with UNIX boxes
2005-12-10T10:54:00.000Z	atrolinux	levander	but the ftp is for connecting to friend's winblows boxes... actually them connecting to mine.  openssh is installed and used, it just won't be for the ftp server
2005-12-10T10:55:00.000Z	levander	atrolinux	what ftp client are you going to have your friends using?
2005-12-10T10:55:00.000Z	levander	atrolinux	most ftp clients support secure-ftp which is I think all you need for it to talk to openssh-server and transfer files
2005-12-10T10:57:00.000Z	levander	atrolinux	only problem is i don't think the standard command line xp utility 'ftp' does support sftp, but i could be wrong
2005-12-10T10:59:00.000Z	atrolinux	levander	either the cli ftp, or IE's horrendous ftp client.  They're not very tech savvy friends.
