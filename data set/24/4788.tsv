2007-02-02T07:05:00.000Z	nemo_play		alright. given lack of familiarity with kernel updates here, guess I'll wander off. later y'all
2007-02-02T07:05:00.000Z	LjL	nemo_play	no, a new kernel is not available as a package for Edgy. it is for Feisty
2007-02-02T07:06:00.000Z	LjL	nemo_play	there's absolutely no guarantees that the Feisty kernel will work on Edgy - actually, chances are it won't. see perhaps in #ubuntu+1 if someone has ever tried that
2007-02-02T07:06:00.000Z	nemo_play	LjL	sooo, feisty is the Ubuntu-speek for unstable branch?
2007-02-02T07:06:00.000Z	LjL	nemo_play	currently, yes
2007-02-02T07:06:00.000Z	nemo_play	LjL	that's the sorta stuff that bugs me. his machine is using a lot of wierd stuff
2007-02-02T07:07:00.000Z	nemo_play	LjL	Nvidia graphics card, ethernet card and network card
2007-02-02T07:07:00.000Z	LjL	nemo_play	ethernet card and network card? =)
2007-02-02T07:07:00.000Z	nemo_play	LjL	some stupid nvidia invention.  I think it is like a combo chip
2007-02-02T07:07:00.000Z	nemo_play	LjL	He's using an eMachine I picked up for 300 bucks
2007-02-02T07:08:00.000Z	LjL	nemo_play	oh. well anyway, if the Ubuntu install is a fresh install with nothing important on it, i guess you've got nothing to lose by just trying and sticking the Feisty kernel on it
2007-02-02T07:08:00.000Z	nemo_play	LjL	I'm remote.  I really can't screw up his machine from 4000km away
2007-02-02T07:09:00.000Z	LjL	nemo_play	hm, i see. well, i can positively say that there's no kernel package newer than 2.6.17 that's anywhere near guaranteed to work with Edgy, sorry
2007-02-02T07:10:00.000Z	nemo_play	LjL	Aight, so I'll tell him his choices are to have USB die randomly 'till April, or take a chance on unstable
2007-02-02T07:10:00.000Z	LjL	nemo_play	or do a kernel compile, i guess
2007-02-02T07:11:00.000Z	nemo_play	LjL	yeah, but that one would almost certainly kill his networking and video
2007-02-02T07:11:00.000Z	nemo_play	LjL	and require updating more than I want to try doing from here
2007-02-02T07:11:00.000Z	LjL	nemo_play	well, just keep in mind that Feisty *is* unstable, meaning that it's quite possible for updates to break little things like X
2007-02-02T07:12:00.000Z	nemo_play	LjL	due to the unstable thing I'm also worried about more esoteric drivers like his not making it out, immediately.
2007-02-02T07:14:00.000Z	nemo_play	LjL	one more thing, being new to ubuntu.  once Feisty is released, will auto-updating be possible, or will it require manual changes or a CD?
2007-02-02T07:15:00.000Z	LjL	nemo_play	there's an updater tool (changing the repos manually is not quite recommended... can be done, but sometimes it breaks things)
2007-02-02T07:16:00.000Z	nemo_play	LjL	thanks. alrighty. good enough for now. later y'all
