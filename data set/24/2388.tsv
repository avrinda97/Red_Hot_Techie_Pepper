2011-01-27T15:37:00.000Z	sacarlson	daedra	can we see also sudo mount  and sudo fdisk -l
2011-01-27T15:39:00.000Z	daedra	sacarlson	sudo mount: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/327696/   sudo fdisk -l: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/327697/
2011-01-27T15:45:00.000Z	sacarlson	daedra	I've never seen this btrfs file format used before does that have some user limits maybe set
2011-01-27T15:49:00.000Z	sacarlson	daedra	I guess you could check with  sudo ulimit -a
2011-01-27T15:50:00.000Z	daedra	sacarlson	ulimit: command not found
2011-01-27T15:51:00.000Z	sacarlson	daedra	wow I can only run ulimit -a as a user not as sudo
2011-01-27T15:52:00.000Z	daedra	sacarlson	same
2011-01-27T15:53:00.000Z	daedra	sacarlson	I think I  know why
2011-01-27T15:53:00.000Z	daedra	sacarlson	it's a per user limit
2011-01-27T15:53:00.000Z	daedra	sacarlson	and you have to be that user
2011-01-27T15:54:00.000Z	daedra	sacarlson	unlimited
2011-01-27T15:56:00.000Z	sacarlson	daedra	well I guess I would look at /etc/fstab and at least maybe see if usrquota is enabled
2011-01-27T15:59:00.000Z	sacarlson	daedra	are these maybe hardware raids that need space for backup like raid1 with mirror
2011-01-27T16:05:00.000Z	sacarlson	daedra	I just found something I'm not sure of here Partition 1 does not end on cylinder boundary.  you seem to overlap partitions sda1 and sda2 is that posible?
2011-01-27T16:24:00.000Z	sacarlson	daedra	I found this message in you fdisk -l Partition 1 does not end on cylinder boundary.   but I assume this won't be seen if we do sudo sfdisk -uS -l /dev/sda
2011-01-27T16:32:00.000Z	sacarlson	daedra	maybe clean up your disk check what uses all the space with Applications>accesories>Disk usage analizer  and find some stuf you don't need like the apt-get cache
2011-01-27T16:34:00.000Z	sacarlson	daedra	static ip?
2011-01-27T16:34:00.000Z	daedra	sacarlson	no
2011-01-27T16:37:00.000Z	sacarlson	daedra	iwconfig wlan0 essid youraccesspointname; sudo dhclient wlan0
2011-01-27T16:38:00.000Z	daedra	sacarlson	with the added wpa_supplicant call
2011-01-27T16:39:00.000Z	sacarlson	daedra	I'm not sure where to add wpa_supplicant on the command line,  maybe in /etc/network/interfaces
2011-01-27T16:39:00.000Z	daedra	sacarlson	Its worked on my archlinux box
2011-01-27T16:40:00.000Z	daedra	sacarlson	I place it after iwconfig wlan0 essid "ESSID",  and before dhcpcd
