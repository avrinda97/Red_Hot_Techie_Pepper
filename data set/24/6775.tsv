2006-12-10T10:57:00.000Z	nn	jeff_	hmm
2006-12-10T10:57:00.000Z	nn	jeff_	i usually just build a kernel
2006-12-10T10:58:00.000Z	jeff_	nn	Im not to sure of this initrd
2006-12-10T10:59:00.000Z	jeff_	nn	I wanted to do the root on nfs
2006-12-10T10:59:00.000Z	nn	jeff_	yea, i'd just build a kernel w/ nfsroot and dhcp
2006-12-10T11:00:00.000Z	jeff_	nn	how it working for you?
2006-12-10T11:01:00.000Z	jeff_	nn	Im busy building a kernel, but not to sure how to do the initrd part of it
2006-12-10T11:01:00.000Z	nn	jeff_	works great, i've got thin clients that boot over wireless that way
2006-12-10T11:02:00.000Z	jeff_	nn	this is what Im trying to do myself
2006-12-10T11:03:00.000Z	jeff_	nn	think it will work?
2006-12-10T11:03:00.000Z	nn	jeff_	I did the opposite (backed up the DoM using dd) and was able to sucessfully restore it
2006-12-10T11:04:00.000Z	nn	jeff_	tried booting off the USB? I've got neowares
2006-12-10T11:04:00.000Z	jeff_	nn	this is good news for me
2006-12-10T11:04:00.000Z	jeff_	nn	do you have any hints on this initrd tpart of the process?
2006-12-10T11:04:00.000Z	nn	jeff_	I didnt do initrd, i just built the drivers i needed into the kernel
2006-12-10T11:05:00.000Z	jeff_	nn	what image did you have on the Doc, Linux or XPe?
2006-12-10T11:05:00.000Z	nn	jeff_	Also, i've got an interesting XPe issue.. my image is busted, but i've got a valid key.. is there some kinda installation media?
2006-12-10T11:05:00.000Z	nn	jeff_	originally linux, booted off thumbdrive, put linux on
2006-12-10T11:05:00.000Z	jeff_	nn	lets talk in a private place
