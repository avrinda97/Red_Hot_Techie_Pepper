2012-09-18T12:33:00.000Z	thierry	woot-0854	 why changing mode from ad-hoc to managed?
2012-09-18T12:34:00.000Z	woot-0854	thierry	oh sorry I thought you where looking for networks? like routers?
2012-09-18T12:35:00.000Z	thierry	woot-0854	what i'm trying to do is creating a local wifi network ( adhoc one) on my system to make other devices connect to it
2012-09-18T12:37:00.000Z	thierry	woot-0854	?
2012-09-18T12:37:00.000Z	thierry	woot-0854	 two wifi on the same PC?

2012-09-18T12:49:00.000Z	thierry	woot-0854	 running on an embedded environment , don't need gui
2012-09-18T12:50:00.000Z	woot-0854	thierry	the gui nerfs servers
2012-09-18T12:50:00.000Z	woot-0854	thierry	but you do not need it
2012-09-18T12:52:00.000Z	thierry	woot-0854	 also, i'm trying to invoke shell commands to setting up the netork in a C++ program using system, i can't see how can i do that when using the gui module to configure the network
2012-09-18T12:52:00.000Z	woot-0854	thierry	epic
2012-09-18T12:52:00.000Z	thierry	woot-0854	 what
2012-09-18T12:53:00.000Z	woot-0854	thierry	i use shell
2012-09-18T12:54:00.000Z	woot-0854	thierry	I just started learning how to program
2012-09-18T12:55:00.000Z	woot-0854	thierry	are you using tmux?
2012-09-18T12:55:00.000Z	thierry	woot-0854	 that's not what i meant, i'm working on a program that will switch between wireless networks : if there is a recognized distant network then the embedded PC will connect on it, otherwise , once this connection is lost , the embedded PC will create its own network so other devices can connect to it ( to do some tasks)
2012-09-18T12:56:00.000Z	woot-0854	thierry	sounds like a movie
2012-09-18T12:57:00.000Z	thierry	woot-0854	 unfortunately it's not a movie and i'm stucked on this
