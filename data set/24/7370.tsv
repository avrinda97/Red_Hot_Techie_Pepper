2005-02-01T11:10:00.000Z	srid		i updated 5 hrs before
2005-02-01T11:12:00.000Z	srid		The following packages have unmet dependencies:
2005-02-01T11:12:00.000Z	srid		  libapache-mod-python: Depends: python (< 2.4) but 2.4-0ubuntu4 is to be installed
2005-02-01T11:12:00.000Z	srid		i updated
2005-02-01T11:12:00.000Z	srid		still depends on 2.3
2005-02-01T11:13:00.000Z	srid		i did apt-cache search modpython
2005-02-01T11:13:00.000Z	srid		which *only* returned  libapache-mod-python
2005-02-01T11:15:00.000Z	trey3	srid	I see libapache2-mod-python2.4 in hoary (which is where python2.4 is...)
2005-02-01T11:16:00.000Z	trey3	srid	hmm... even in hoary though, seems libapache2-mod-python depends python >= 2.4?
2005-02-01T11:17:00.000Z	trey3	srid	when was the last time you apt-get update'd?
2005-02-01T11:17:00.000Z	srid	trey3	just now
2005-02-01T11:18:00.000Z	srid	trey3	have you programmed using modpython?
2005-02-01T11:19:00.000Z	trey3	srid	nah... just know how to use the package system  ;)
2005-02-11T14:11:00.000Z	trey3	srid	have you 'apt-get build-dep pkg' ?
2005-02-11T14:11:00.000Z	srid	trey3	i installed .deb (not source)
2005-02-11T14:12:00.000Z	trey3	srid	that doesn't answer my question...
2005-02-11T14:12:00.000Z	srid	trey3	i am compiling _that_ sdl app through the give makefile (make)
2005-02-11T14:13:00.000Z	trey3	srid	bah... you need to install the packages that it build depends... hence apt-get build-dep...
2005-02-11T14:14:00.000Z	srid	trey3	i installed it
2005-02-11T14:14:00.000Z	trey3	srid	obviously not...
2005-02-11T14:14:00.000Z	srid	trey3	what do you think that package may be apart from libsdl?
2005-02-11T14:17:00.000Z	trey3	srid	my mistake... I thought what daniels said _was_ a listed build depend...
2005-02-11T14:17:00.000Z	trey3	srid	what daniels said is basically a compatibility package for xfree for people using xorg...
2005-02-11T14:18:00.000Z	trey3	srid	that should have done it...
