2010-10-13T06:01:00.000Z	nerdy_kid	alberto	I had it running
2010-10-13T06:04:00.000Z	nerdy_kid	alberto	if i remember correctly you install the pulseaudio-module-jack and then all you have to do is run a script once you start jack

2010-10-13T06:25:00.000Z	nerdy_kid	alberto	I think that the error is saying "connection refused"?  in that case is jackd running?  i was using qjackctl to control jack btw.
2010-10-13T06:26:00.000Z	alberto	nerdy_kid	mmm, no, jackd isn't running actually
2010-10-13T06:26:00.000Z	alberto	nerdy_kid	Is qjackctl better?
2010-10-13T06:26:00.000Z	nerdy_kid	alberto	qjackctl is a REALLY handy control app for jackd
2010-10-13T06:27:00.000Z	alberto	nerdy_kid	Oh, I see, that's the one I'm using.
2010-10-13T06:28:00.000Z	alberto	nerdy_kid	The graphical user interface
2010-10-13T06:29:00.000Z	nerdy_kid	alberto	yeah
