2006-12-10T09:43:00.000Z	kwood		Is it possible to install LAMP with the ubuntu graphical features upon installation? ie LAMP + the features of  ubuntu install
2006-12-10T09:43:00.000Z	rexbron	kwood	Install a lamp and then install ubuntu-desktopp?
2006-12-10T09:46:00.000Z	rexbron	kwood	Do the lamp server install then "sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop"
2006-12-10T09:47:00.000Z	rexbron	kwood	I am pretty sure that ubuntu desktop depends on things like X,org
2006-12-10T09:47:00.000Z	kwood	rexbron	so i would use the server install then run the install of u desktop?
2006-12-10T09:48:00.000Z	rexbron	kwood	ubuntu-desktop depends on xorg, so you should be set for GUI's
2006-12-10T09:48:00.000Z	rexbron	kwood	leme check with a friend
2006-12-10T09:48:00.000Z	rexbron	kwood	hes done this before
2006-12-10T09:48:00.000Z	kwood	rexbron	alright thanks
2006-12-10T09:49:00.000Z	rexbron	kwood	darn, he is asleep
2006-12-10T09:49:00.000Z	rexbron	kwood	but you should be fine
2006-12-10T09:50:00.000Z	rexbron	kwood	This will give you the server funtionality with a regular desktop
2006-12-10T09:51:00.000Z	kwood	rexbron	this command? "sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop"

2006-12-10T09:51:00.000Z	rexbron	kwood	that is a good tutorial
2006-12-10T09:51:00.000Z	rexbron	kwood	oh ok
2006-12-10T09:53:00.000Z	kwood	rexbron	you think generally a 6.06 guide will go with a 6.10?
2006-12-10T09:53:00.000Z	rexbron	kwood	I read it over
2006-12-10T09:54:00.000Z	rexbron	kwood	you need to download the server install cd
2006-12-10T09:54:00.000Z	kwood	rexbron	but it looks like sudo apt-get update will still work
2006-12-10T09:55:00.000Z	rexbron	kwood	it will give you the dapper ubuntu-desktop (if you use dapper)
2006-12-10T09:55:00.000Z	rexbron	kwood	you can get an edgy server install if you watn
2006-12-10T09:56:00.000Z	kwood	rexbron	yah my spped sucks... so ill see if it works with 6.10 first before i have to wait hours lol
2006-12-10T09:56:00.000Z	rexbron	kwood	ok best of luck
