2007-06-07T15:12:00.000Z	ziroday		this may sound like a really stupid question but how do i find out my remote computer ip to connect to it when im away from the remote computer?
2007-06-07T15:12:00.000Z	ziroday		if that makes sense
2007-06-07T15:13:00.000Z	jhaig	ziroday	nslookup <hostname>
2007-06-07T15:13:00.000Z	jhaig	ziroday	I assume you know the hostname.
2007-06-07T15:13:00.000Z	ziroday	jhaig	but im not on my network
2007-06-07T15:14:00.000Z	jhaig	ziroday	OK, what information do you know?
2007-06-07T15:14:00.000Z	ziroday	jhaig	my hostname is ambassador
2007-06-07T15:14:00.000Z	ziroday	jhaig	and thats it, but i can find out more if needed?
2007-06-07T15:14:00.000Z	jhaig	ziroday	If the network is behind a router you will need to set up the router to forward the port.
2007-06-07T15:14:00.000Z	ziroday	jhaig	so i have to use ssh?
2007-06-07T15:15:00.000Z	jhaig	ziroday	Yes (probably)
2007-06-07T15:15:00.000Z	ziroday	jhaig	confusing lol
2007-06-07T15:16:00.000Z	ziroday	jhaig	do you have any wiki's or something?
2007-06-07T15:16:00.000Z	jhaig	ziroday	Yes, you will need to use ssh to log in remotely.  I said probably, because you might be wanting to connect to some other server, such as a web server or an ftp server.
2007-06-07T15:16:00.000Z	ziroday	jhaig	how about a webserver with torrentflux on it
2007-06-07T15:17:00.000Z	ziroday	jhaig	how would i connect to that
2007-06-07T15:18:00.000Z	jhaig	ziroday	What is your setup?  Is it a network behind a router?
2007-06-07T15:19:00.000Z	ziroday	jhaig	yeah i have DSL then  a router then my comp
2007-06-07T15:21:00.000Z	ziroday	jhaig	and the ip would look something like this yeah?, 218.254.11.258:698
2007-06-07T15:21:00.000Z	jhaig	ziroday	If you don't have a fixed ip address there are ways of getting your address fixed to a hostname each time you connect, but I don't know too much about that.
2007-06-07T15:21:00.000Z	jhaig	ziroday	218.254.11.258 is the ip address and 698 is the port.
2007-06-07T15:21:00.000Z	ziroday	jhaig	thanks ill have a look
2007-06-07T15:23:00.000Z	jhaig	ziroday	So, for example, I have port 22 (ssh) set to forward to machine 10.0.0.254 on my local network.
2007-06-07T15:24:00.000Z	ziroday	jhaig	a thousand thanks
