2008-01-25T07:25:00.000Z	melanie		especially when you use it to install
2008-01-25T07:27:00.000Z	melanie		so i did an aptitude reinstall firefox, and when i run firefox from the terminal it doesn't put anything out
2008-01-25T07:27:00.000Z	melanie		it just goes to the nextline, and firefox is nowhere
2008-01-25T07:29:00.000Z	melanie		the only way i can get firefox or opera to run is if i run them as root

2008-01-25T07:30:00.000Z	melanie		oops
2008-01-25T07:30:00.000Z	melanie		1 sec
2008-01-25T07:30:00.000Z	melanie		0 /usr/bin/firefox
2008-01-25T07:31:00.000Z	melanie		now i can't write to my home directory?
2008-01-25T07:31:00.000Z	melanie		what should the permissions of ~ be?
2008-01-25T07:32:00.000Z	Dr_willis	melanie	 check the permissions of /home/USERNAME  (with ls -l /home/username)
2008-01-25T07:32:00.000Z	melanie	Dr_willis	what should i see?
2008-01-25T07:33:00.000Z	Dr_willis	melanie	  see if the root user can make a file in /home/menanie
2008-01-25T07:33:00.000Z	melanie	Dr_willis	well when i chown'd my ~ firefox now runs w/o root privelges
2008-01-25T07:34:00.000Z	Dr_willis	melanie	 somthingdid not make since there. :)  firefox shouldent be running  as root anyway.. and your ownership is proper.
2008-01-25T07:34:00.000Z	melanie	Dr_willis	i know it shouldn't, but that was the only way it would run until i chown'd my dir
2008-01-25T07:34:00.000Z	Dr_willis	melanie	 if you chowned stuff IN ~ thats the same as chowning stuff in  your home dir. NOT the /home/username dir
2008-01-25T07:35:00.000Z	melanie	Dr_willis	i know that
2008-01-25T07:35:00.000Z	Dr_willis	melanie	 you may have some goofed up files in .mozilla  try renaming that dir.
2008-01-25T07:36:00.000Z	melanie	Dr_willis	i rm'd that dir
2008-01-25T07:36:00.000Z	Dr_willis	melanie	 as a test you could make a new user - see if firefox works for them
2008-01-25T07:36:00.000Z	melanie	Dr_willis	i can guarantee it will
2008-01-25T07:39:00.000Z	Dr_willis	melanie	 interesting. and if you remove the .mozilla dir. and then run firefox it still crashes eh?
2008-01-25T07:40:00.000Z	melanie	Dr_willis	ok so i removed the .mozilla directory from my home directory
