2006-07-30T10:14:00.000Z	jn	sethk	can you help me with the time.. my timezone is correct, and i used ntpdate pool.ntp.org
2006-07-30T10:15:00.000Z	sethk	jn	ntp can take several minutes to sync up.  Did you kill and restart the clock?
2006-07-30T10:16:00.000Z	sethk	jn	do  ps aux | grep -i clock.   that should show you the name of the clock program.  then try to kill it and restart it.  Or do it the easy way and reboot.
2006-07-30T10:19:00.000Z	sethk	jn	that is odd.  I would reboot and see if the "contacting ntp server" step completes normally.
2006-07-30T10:19:00.000Z	sethk	jn	that's kind of like telling someone to reboot windows because you don't know what else to do, but in this case it might actually be helpful.  :)
2006-07-30T10:24:00.000Z	jn	sethk	any ideas for me?
2006-07-30T10:25:00.000Z	sethk	jn	did you reboot?  if so, do   dmesg | grep ntp     see if it contacted the ntp server successfully
2006-07-30T10:26:00.000Z	sethk	jn	that's odd.
2006-07-30T10:27:00.000Z	sethk	jn	I didn't see everything you said earlier.  you installed ntpdate?
2006-07-30T10:27:00.000Z	jn	sethk	ntpdate syncs the time but it thinks its correct so it's by milaseconds
2006-07-30T10:28:00.000Z	sethk	jn	ok, do you get the correct minutes but the wrong hours?
2006-07-30T10:29:00.000Z	sethk	jn	try rebooting and going into setup.  see what the hardware clock is set to.  If it is not set to gmt, then change it.
2006-07-30T10:30:00.000Z	sethk	jn	sounds like the hardware clock is set to local time, and the system, thinking that the hardware clock is set to gmt, is changing it by seven hours to get what it thinks is local time.
2006-07-30T10:30:00.000Z	sethk	jn	usually when you reboot the system it will say "press del for setup"   or press f10, or something similar.
2006-07-30T10:30:00.000Z	sethk	jn	right
2006-07-30T10:31:00.000Z	sethk	jn	that's where you can check/set the hardware clock
2006-07-30T10:41:00.000Z	sethk	jn	np
2006-07-30T10:48:00.000Z	jn	sethk	so i guess what im gonna do is turn off that ntp service or stop it from auto updating, and set time in bios
2006-07-30T10:49:00.000Z	sethk	jn	there is still something off in the time zone setting.  I'll have to look up how that works, but I can't do it right now.  You can disable it for the time being.
2006-07-30T10:49:00.000Z	sethk	jn	I think I would just lie to it about the time zone and force it to read the correct time.
2006-07-30T10:51:00.000Z	jn	sethk	lie to it about the time zone? or turn it off.. i dont know how to do either.
2006-07-30T10:52:00.000Z	sethk	jn	as soon as I get off this phone call I'll look up where the time zone config lives.
2006-07-30T10:59:00.000Z	jn	sethk	something i remembered, when i initially installed ubuntu i had the time wrong but i did set the time zone correctly.. that could have something to do with this problem im having now
2006-08-28T09:48:00.000Z	sethk	jn	are you thinking of termcap or terminfo?
