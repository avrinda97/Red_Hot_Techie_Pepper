2007-12-09T23:38:00.000Z	LjL	bazhang	rain asked how to replace the K icon i think... that's a bit different from installing kbfx
2007-12-09T23:38:00.000Z	bazhang	LjL	oops sorry
2008-02-07T19:27:00.000Z	LjL	bazhang	that's because it's not only fixed but available (i would assume) in every mirror, so people will just find out when they turn on their computer
2008-02-07T19:27:00.000Z	bazhang	LjL	thanks!
2008-02-07T19:31:00.000Z	LjL	bazhang	freenode allows Tor, except during times when there's high levels of abuse
2008-02-07T19:31:00.000Z	LjL	bazhang	#ubuntu doesn't however
2008-02-07T19:31:00.000Z	bazhang	LjL	ah thanks again!
2008-03-16T20:01:00.000Z	LjL	bazhang	(aptitude is recommended by Debian)
2008-03-16T22:07:00.000Z	bazhang	LjL	haha
2008-04-30T05:38:00.000Z	bazhang	LjL	sorry to log off yesterday-->was installing ubuntu-desktop
2009-04-17T18:53:00.000Z	LjL	bazhang	i made a mixture of the two :P
2009-04-17T18:53:00.000Z	bazhang	LjL	haha
2009-10-23T19:24:00.000Z	bazhang	LjL	got him
2010-05-21T18:56:00.000Z	LjL	bazhang	check +e's too, there's likely to be a few of those
2010-06-30T05:09:00.000Z	LjL	bazhang	^
2010-07-30T15:19:00.000Z	LjL	bazhang	the sad news is that was english... :(
2010-09-28T16:46:00.000Z	LjL	bazhang	err... he's not polling
2011-04-27T17:15:00.000Z	LjL	bazhang	while you're there, there are quite a few mutes standing i've noticed...
2011-04-29T16:58:00.000Z	bazhang	LjL	that was really foul, what he said
2012-01-25T17:06:00.000Z	LjL	bazhang	eh, -image might not be, but the rest of the packages kind of are
2012-01-25T18:20:00.000Z	LjL	bazhang	yes, Quanta is KDE3-only
2012-01-25T18:20:00.000Z	bazhang	LjL	ok
2012-02-18T20:25:00.000Z	bazhang	LjL	it only shows 3.5
2012-02-18T20:25:00.000Z	LjL	bazhang	right, but when instructed to install 64-bit Ubuntu, he said it's a 32-bit system. i have my doubt a pure 32-bit system would have 16GB of RAM.
