2005-08-25T05:54:00.000Z	somedude_		Hey!
2005-08-25T05:55:00.000Z	somedude_		when installing i only got to configure a non root useraccount, and i got package failures.. tried to fix them but couldnt as non root.. ???
2005-08-25T05:56:00.000Z	HappyFool	somedude_	use 'sudo' to get root access; read the link below
2005-08-25T05:58:00.000Z	somedude_	HappyFool	aha.. ok thanks! One more liittle Q - whats the password? Do i set it the first time i sudo or??
2005-08-25T05:58:00.000Z	HappyFool	somedude_	it's your user password (whatever you login with)
2005-08-27T13:50:00.000Z	HappyFool	somedude_	good question; never noticed that file before
2005-08-27T13:51:00.000Z	somedude_	HappyFool	crap.. i didnt put it there and accedently removed it.. trying to restore the folder to how it was.. but im stuck with that file.. on the other hand SAMBA is working.. but somehing isnt.. dont know what :P
2005-08-27T13:51:00.000Z	HappyFool	somedude_	it appears to be a part of the samba-common package
2005-08-27T13:51:00.000Z	HappyFool	somedude_	maybe if you reinstall that, it will return
2005-08-27T13:51:00.000Z	somedude_	HappyFool	hmm.. so if i remove the samba-common pack and install it - it should come back right??
2005-08-27T13:51:00.000Z	HappyFool	somedude_	or just reinstall: 'sudo aptitude reinstall samba-common'
2005-08-27T13:53:00.000Z	somedude_	HappyFool	it didnt work.. :( ill try your tip robotgeek! .. just a sec
2005-08-27T13:57:00.000Z	HappyFool	somedude_	see here for some info on the file: http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/03/msg01844.html   -- it's probably not that important; mine has just two lines, one with 'bt' and the other with 'quit'
2005-08-27T13:57:00.000Z	HappyFool	somedude_	it probably just generates a backtrace if something goes wrong
2005-08-27T13:58:00.000Z	HappyFool	somedude_	ah-ha -- look in /usr/share/samba/panic-action -- that's where gdbcommands gets used
2005-08-27T13:59:00.000Z	somedude_	HappyFool	robotgeek, OMG.. i was standing in the samba folder all the time issuing all your commands.. did a ls -lah and nada.. BUT when i cd out of the dir and did a ls -lah samba/ all the files showed up!.. is that supposed to happen???
2005-08-27T14:00:00.000Z	HappyFool	somedude_	the /etc/samba directory was removed when you did a purge
2005-08-27T14:00:00.000Z	HappyFool	somedude_	the directory you were listing was some non-existent (ie. deleted) dir
2005-08-27T14:00:00.000Z	somedude_	HappyFool	but it was replaced?
2005-08-27T14:00:00.000Z	HappyFool	somedude_	indeed, as you've seen
2005-08-27T14:01:00.000Z	somedude_	HappyFool	but i did a ls -lah a second before and it was empty, then cd .. and then ls -lah samba/ and POFF.. all is well..
2005-08-27T14:01:00.000Z	HappyFool	somedude_	the 'CWD' got muddled when /etc/samba was erased by the 'purge'
2005-08-27T14:02:00.000Z	HappyFool	somedude_	your CWD was some nebulous nowhere; and when the new /etc/samba was created, you were not there, but still in limbo
2005-08-27T14:02:00.000Z	somedude_	HappyFool	ok.. i think i understand.. well olmost! And thats good enough!! haha.. many thanks to you both!! :))
