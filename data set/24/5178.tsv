2007-01-26T12:29:00.000Z	FunnyMan3595		I'm looking for a way to set up an SSH connection that redirects to a plaintext connection on a local port.  Any ideas?
2007-01-26T12:30:00.000Z	graft	FunnyMan3595	details?
2007-01-26T12:32:00.000Z	graft	FunnyMan3595	um, not possible, or not easy, anyway
2007-01-26T12:32:00.000Z	graft	FunnyMan3595	you could do it with netcat if they could authenticate on that machine
2007-01-26T12:33:00.000Z	graft	FunnyMan3595	but any user can do it securely themselves
2007-01-26T12:33:00.000Z	FunnyMan3595	graft	I've got full control over the server, so I can do whatever needed.
2007-01-26T12:33:00.000Z	graft	FunnyMan3595	yeah, but ssh doesn't do that...
2007-01-26T12:33:00.000Z	graft	FunnyMan3595	unless you want to give all your MUD users local accounts, which i highly doubt
2007-01-26T12:33:00.000Z	FunnyMan3595	graft	The problem is that the people using the MUD aren't users of the machine, and furthermore aren't geeks, so having them set up a port forwarding is a bit much.
2007-01-26T12:41:00.000Z	graft	FunnyMan3595	how's this - make a user with no authentication whose shell simply forwards connections to your mud port?
2007-01-26T12:41:00.000Z	graft	FunnyMan3595	or make a user with public authentication
2007-01-26T12:42:00.000Z	graft	FunnyMan3595	err, password that everyone knows, i mean
2007-01-26T12:42:00.000Z	FunnyMan3595	graft	That's the general idea.
2007-01-26T12:42:00.000Z	graft	FunnyMan3595	yeah, so what's the hangup?
2007-01-26T12:42:00.000Z	FunnyMan3595	graft	Making sure that's *all* the user can do.
2007-01-26T12:43:00.000Z	graft	FunnyMan3595	pretty easy to lock up a user... don't make a home dir, should be fine
2007-01-26T12:44:00.000Z	FunnyMan3595	graft	Any idea how to disable port-forwarding on a per-user basis?
2007-01-26T12:53:00.000Z	graft	FunnyMan3595	um, just have two ssh servers running, and lock one up completely - no port forwarding, no agent forwarding, no x11 forwarding.
2007-01-26T12:54:00.000Z	FunnyMan3595	graft	How do I keep them from using the other server?
2007-01-26T12:54:00.000Z	graft	FunnyMan3595	you can lock their user out of it, presumably
2007-01-26T12:54:00.000Z	FunnyMan3595	graft	I see sshd_config has an AllowUsers option...
2007-01-26T12:54:00.000Z	graft	FunnyMan3595	also DenyUsers
2007-01-26T12:55:00.000Z	FunnyMan3595	graft	Aha, and there's the -f switch on sshd to specify an alternate config file.
2007-01-26T12:56:00.000Z	FunnyMan3595	graft	Okay, I'm going to go see if I can get that working now.
