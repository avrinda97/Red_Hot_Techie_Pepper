2008-07-28T05:07:00.000Z	ikonia	Blaqlight	why have you not answered my questions
2008-07-28T05:07:00.000Z	Blaqlight	ikonia	you asked me a question?
2008-07-28T05:07:00.000Z	ikonia	Blaqlight	yes, all your problems are down to the fact that your not connected to the wirless lan. The question is what happens when you open an application with a need for sudo/gksudo
