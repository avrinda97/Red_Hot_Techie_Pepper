2007-02-24T07:03:00.000Z	quanchi2		can someone please work with me personally to teach me how to make a dual boot?  I'm afraid of deleting my primary partition.  If anyone can forward me to a good guide or walk me through, I'd appreciate it.
2007-02-24T07:04:00.000Z	quanchi2		?? anyone?

2007-02-24T07:04:00.000Z	bengoodger	quanchi2	use a partitioner to resize the partition, and then make a couple of new ones as appropriate in the empty space
2007-02-24T07:06:00.000Z	bengoodger	quanchi2	what's the problem with gparted? you just click "resize"..
2007-02-24T07:07:00.000Z	bengoodger	quanchi2	yes, then you go click apply... then choose "guided partitioning into unallocated space" from the options
2007-02-24T07:12:00.000Z	bengoodger	quanchi2	yes, at hugely inflated prices
2007-02-24T07:20:00.000Z	bengoodger	quanchi2	you're not listening to us. there are no need for guides, since it's really not difficult. you simply arrive at the partitioner, select "manual partitioning", use it to shrink your windows partition (use your brain to do this), apply, and then go back and select "use largest contiguous free space" or similar as I said ages ago.
2007-02-24T07:21:00.000Z	bengoodger	quanchi2	it's very intuitive and not at all hard, and only by being extremely stupid (i.e. ignoring the comfirmation option to delete your windows partition) will you screw it up
2007-02-24T07:24:00.000Z	bengoodger	quanchi2	using one's brain is quite sufficient for using linux. unlike windows, it is neither necessary nor possible to manage by repeating the same series of mouseclicks over and over having memorised them painstakingly
2007-02-24T07:25:00.000Z	bengoodger	quanchi2	excellent
2007-02-24T07:25:00.000Z	bengoodger	quanchi2	make yourself a new 1GB partition, formatted as swap
2007-02-24T07:27:00.000Z	bengoodger	quanchi2	yep
2007-02-24T07:27:00.000Z	bengoodger	quanchi2	not unless you tell it to
2007-02-24T07:28:00.000Z	bengoodger	quanchi2	read above my last message
2007-02-24T07:32:00.000Z	bengoodger	quanchi2	it runs much, much faster off the hard disk
2007-02-24T07:32:00.000Z	bengoodger	quanchi2	it runs much, much faster off the hard disk
2007-02-24T07:33:00.000Z	bengoodger	quanchi2	I hope to be at some point... I'm learning python/gtk atm
2007-02-24T07:33:00.000Z	bengoodger	quanchi2	you have my pity
2007-02-24T07:34:00.000Z	bengoodger	quanchi2	however, being a programmer makes people assume that you're capable of basic partitioning tasks... evidently windows is more patronising nowadays
2007-02-24T07:34:00.000Z	bengoodger	quanchi2	it shoul
2007-02-24T07:34:00.000Z	bengoodger	quanchi2	indeed
2007-02-24T07:35:00.000Z	bengoodger	quanchi2	DOOM3 runs on linux, you know :P
2007-02-24T07:36:00.000Z	bengoodger	quanchi2	DOOM was OK... gameplay was good, but the engine was tripe. of course, I only predate it by three years so I'm used to better graphics
