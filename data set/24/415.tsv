2011-09-24T07:49:00.000Z	Ubuntusawr[xD]	zakidine	So what are you really here asking for? A mac-like theme for Ubunut?

2011-09-24T07:53:00.000Z	Ubuntusawr[xD]	zakidine	It's redundant to have that in Unity anyway. Unless you're willing to Either use "Gnome Classic", or remove the unity Launcher tray.
2011-09-24T07:54:00.000Z	Ubuntusawr[xD]	zakidine	The point of the Launcher tray on the LEFT side is like a windows 7    Task Bar.
2011-09-24T07:56:00.000Z	Ubuntusawr[xD]	zakidine	I know you can not have that "mac bar", without a dock or some program that does that.
2011-09-24T07:58:00.000Z	zakidine	Ubuntusawr[xD]	 i think i can, the page i had read did not talk about docks
2011-09-24T07:58:00.000Z	Ubuntusawr[xD]	zakidine	Yea, that's what they would do sometimes.
2011-09-24T08:00:00.000Z	Ubuntusawr[xD]	zakidine	When you do find it, please post the link here. :)

2011-09-24T08:12:00.000Z	Ubuntusawr[xD]	zakidine	The Global Menu I mentioned earlier.
2011-09-24T08:13:00.000Z	Ubuntusawr[xD]	zakidine	What version of Ubuntu are you using? This is available in Ubuntu 11.04
