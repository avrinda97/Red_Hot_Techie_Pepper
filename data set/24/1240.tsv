2010-05-20T00:19:00.000Z	FriedrichMan		hello
2010-05-20T00:19:00.000Z	FriedrichMan		maybe somebody's got the answer to this: I am trying to use thunderbird and it keeps asking me for the password... I write the password... and asks me for the password again...
2010-05-20T00:19:00.000Z	FriedrichMan		what's up with that?
2010-05-20T00:20:00.000Z	Sam_Fisher	FriedrichMan	Does it get your mail?
2010-05-20T00:21:00.000Z	FriedrichMan	Sam_Fisher	i don't know... I have no new mail I guess
2010-05-20T00:22:00.000Z	Sam_Fisher	FriedrichMan	what's your address I'll make sure you get some new email
2010-05-20T00:22:00.000Z	FriedrichMan	Sam_Fisher	abrojo11@hotmail.com
2010-05-20T00:23:00.000Z	Sam_Fisher	FriedrichMan	sent
2010-05-20T00:24:00.000Z	Sam_Fisher	FriedrichMan	sometimes when the settings get messed up from the beginning Tbird requires the account to be deleted and to start over
2010-05-20T00:24:00.000Z	FriedrichMan	Sam_Fisher	it asks me for the password again
2010-05-20T00:26:00.000Z	Sam_Fisher	FriedrichMan	Is there an option to check Remember Password?
2010-05-20T00:27:00.000Z	FriedrichMan	Sam_Fisher	in the accounts passwords... not the master password
2010-05-20T00:28:00.000Z	Sam_Fisher	FriedrichMan	master pwd? hmm I don't recall there being one. Is it perhaps the one for the interent connection?
2010-05-20T00:28:00.000Z	Sam_Fisher	FriedrichMan	sorry I am not helping much
2010-05-20T00:28:00.000Z	FriedrichMan	Sam_Fisher	it's ok... I guess I'll just have to keep using hotmail
2010-05-20T00:28:00.000Z	Sam_Fisher	FriedrichMan	nnnnnnnnnnnooooooooooooooooooooooooo
2010-05-20T00:29:00.000Z	Sam_Fisher	FriedrichMan	so you can't recieve email?
2010-05-20T00:29:00.000Z	FriedrichMan	Sam_Fisher	unfortunatly
2010-05-20T00:30:00.000Z	Sam_Fisher	FriedrichMan	create a new account from the beginning.
2010-05-20T00:30:00.000Z	Sam_Fisher	FriedrichMan	perhaps you missed a step or typed the wrong thing
2010-05-20T00:30:00.000Z	FriedrichMan	Sam_Fisher	it's the master password so I cannot do anything in here.
2010-05-20T00:31:00.000Z	Sam_Fisher	FriedrichMan	Cynthia is correct. I used Tbird to backup my Gmail accounts to DVD. Now I can look back on what a fool I was when I was younger.
2010-05-20T00:37:00.000Z	Sam_Fisher	FriedrichMan	so you had tbird working then somewher in tbird found a master password option?
2010-05-20T00:38:00.000Z	Sam_Fisher	FriedrichMan	oh noo! I stick with my name and birthday since I can usually remember it and if not I can ask my Mom
