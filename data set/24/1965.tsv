2011-07-23T19:48:00.000Z	edbian	wols_	I think unity will work for him
2011-07-23T19:48:00.000Z	wols_	edbian	in 512MB? sure he can run it, but he doesn't want to
2011-07-23T19:49:00.000Z	edbian	wols_	semitones_ I just think it's too close a call to make the decision for you
2011-07-23T19:59:00.000Z	edbian	wols_	You agree with wubi, not love4linux problem right?
2011-07-23T20:01:00.000Z	wols_	edbian	I agree with you that wubi is satanspawn and should never be used
2011-07-23T20:01:00.000Z	edbian	wols_	oh it's not that bad!

2011-08-04T21:27:00.000Z	edbian	wols_	That bring up a blank window?
2011-08-04T21:27:00.000Z	wols_	edbian	then use whatever your irc client uses to check the backlog
2011-08-04T21:28:00.000Z	edbian	wols_	:P
2011-08-04T21:29:00.000Z	edbian	wols_	Do you need help helping him or am I just annoying ?
2011-08-04T21:31:00.000Z	wols_	edbian	feel free. it's acentrino 62xx
2011-08-04T21:31:00.000Z	edbian	wols_	The driver?
2011-08-04T21:31:00.000Z	wols_	edbian	the wlan chip he wants to get working
2011-08-04T21:32:00.000Z	edbian	wols_	I saw his lspci pastebin: it was an intel centrino advanced-n 6205 (is that different than an acentrino 62xx)

2011-08-04T21:35:00.000Z	wols_	edbian	I know but he said it wouldn't work
2011-08-04T21:35:00.000Z	edbian	wols_	interesting
2011-08-04T21:38:00.000Z	edbian	wols_	I showed you up!
2011-08-04T21:39:00.000Z	wols_	edbian	and what did you actually _do_ that solved the problem? I haven't seen you make him change anything or install anything, right?
2011-08-04T21:39:00.000Z	edbian	wols_	That's right.  It was simply working when I told him to run sudo iwlist scan
2011-08-04T21:41:00.000Z	wols_	edbian	so no connection yet. and why no WPA directly? not as if nm makes it hard
2011-08-04T21:42:00.000Z	edbian	wols_	I don't know.  I'm not convinced it was working.  Just being silly mostly.  I wnat him to turn off all security to see if he can connect to an open network.  Sometimes wpa / wpa2 cause problems
