2009-07-24T12:18:00.000Z	Gnea	sillybg	yes
2009-07-24T12:18:00.000Z	sillybg	Gnea	I am heading home soon, so I will try and monday, see if it works, hopefully it does, because it looks good.  I only have a Netbook that I am running it on, but I want to play
2009-07-24T12:19:00.000Z	Gnea	sillybg	e17 is a blast, you'll have fun with it - also check the #e channel for specific support when you do get it running
2009-07-24T12:19:00.000Z	sillybg	Gnea	yeah, but that was crap, because it kept on sticking on checking for updates, said that it couldnt find the website
2009-07-24T12:20:00.000Z	sillybg	Gnea	but that was with the netbook remix, I am running standard desktop now
2009-07-24T12:20:00.000Z	sillybg	Gnea	its hard to remember to type your name first
2009-07-24T12:21:00.000Z	Gnea	sillybg	aah ok. i don't have a netbook yet so there's only so much I can help with
2009-07-24T12:21:00.000Z	Gnea	sillybg	you'll get used to it :)
2009-07-24T12:21:00.000Z	sillybg	Gnea	shouldnt make too much difference.  the netbook remix was useless anyway
2009-07-24T12:21:00.000Z	sillybg	Gnea	It wasnt actually any faster, only reason it would be better is if you had a touchscreen
2009-07-24T12:22:00.000Z	Gnea	sillybg	that's odd
