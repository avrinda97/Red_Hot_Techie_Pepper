2006-01-24T11:15:00.000Z	stevenj		My usb mouse (of all things) is the only thing that keeps dapper from booting.  Then I connect the mouse at GDM and it works....any ideas??
2006-01-24T11:15:00.000Z	mustard5	stevenj	what part of the startup fails when the mouse is plugged in?
2006-01-24T11:16:00.000Z	stevenj	mustard5	xserver fails with mouse usb mouse connected
2006-01-24T11:16:00.000Z	mustard5	stevenj	have you tried reconfiguring xorg.conf?
2006-01-24T11:16:00.000Z	stevenj	mustard5	let me check the log
2006-01-24T11:20:00.000Z	stevenj	mustard5	when mouse is connected xserver fails and gives mouse errors..when unconnected log show mouse loaded. I plug in mouse and it works until I reboot with mouse
2006-01-24T11:21:00.000Z	stevenj	mustard5	how do I reconfigure xserver?
2006-01-24T11:21:00.000Z	mustard5	stevenj	you can do this in terminal...  sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg    and choose the default answers for things you don't know the answers for
2006-01-24T11:22:00.000Z	mustard5	stevenj	it will create a backup of your old xorg.conf when it writes a new one
2006-01-24T11:22:00.000Z	stevenj	mustard5	hmm ok..I remember doing just that..yesterday before I figured out it was the mouse crap'n everything out...I"ll try again
2006-01-24T11:23:00.000Z	mustard5	stevenj	in your xorg.conf there is another command in the comments up top of the file...you could try that one too
2006-01-24T11:23:00.000Z	mustard5	stevenj	I don't know what the difference between them is....but that one shown in the comments section of the xorg.conf file has some options associated with the command that might help
2006-01-24T11:28:00.000Z	stevenj	mustard5	reconfigure did not change anything; however, nvidia driver works good :)
2006-01-24T11:28:00.000Z	mustard5	stevenj	hehe well thats a bonus :)
2006-01-24T11:28:00.000Z	mustard5	stevenj	did you check out the comments section at the top of your xorg.conf file?
2006-01-24T11:29:00.000Z	mustard5	stevenj	there is another command there..with other options in it
2006-01-24T11:29:00.000Z	mustard5	stevenj	other than that I am not sure what to do
2006-01-24T11:32:00.000Z	stevenj	mustard5	ok looking through xorg and comparing it with my breezy xorg-I see that the mouse protocol is ImPS/2 in breezy and ExplorerPS/2 in this config hmmm
2006-01-24T11:33:00.000Z	mustard5	stevenj	thats a good clue then perhaps :)
2006-01-24T11:33:00.000Z	mustard5	stevenj	its worth a try
2006-01-24T11:34:00.000Z	stevenj	mustard5	I know I choose ImPS/2 in reconfigure-guess it did'n "take". thanks
2006-01-24T11:35:00.000Z	stevenj	mustard5	also the ZaxisMapping is missing in this xorg...wonder what that is and if it matters
2006-01-24T11:36:00.000Z	mustard5	stevenj	I have no idea :)
2006-01-24T11:36:00.000Z	stevenj	mustard5	sounds cool...maybe I'll use ;)
