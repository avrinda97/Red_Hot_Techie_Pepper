2007-11-23T13:13:00.000Z	m0nk3ym4n		I am
2007-11-23T13:14:00.000Z	m0nk3ym4n		I really don't want to reinstall Ubuntu
2007-11-23T13:14:00.000Z	m0nk3ym4n		How do I reset my sound settings to default?
2007-11-23T13:14:00.000Z	m0nk3ym4n		Because it worked
2007-11-23T13:14:00.000Z	m0nk3ym4n		then
2007-11-23T13:14:00.000Z	m0nk3ym4n		I don't know how I broke it
2007-11-23T13:15:00.000Z	hunteke	m0nk3ym4n	use synaptic, and search your installed applications for anything to do with sound
2007-11-23T13:15:00.000Z	hunteke	m0nk3ym4n	then right click and completely uninstall and remove configuration files all of them
2007-11-23T13:17:00.000Z	m0nk3ym4n	hunteke	How do I remove config files?
2007-11-23T13:17:00.000Z	hunteke	m0nk3ym4n	again, at your own risk, I generally don't promote this method for those who don't know what they're doing or would be scared of fiddilng
2007-11-23T13:18:00.000Z	hunteke	m0nk3ym4n	should be able to right-click and there should be an option for "completely remove" as opposed to just remove
2007-11-23T13:21:00.000Z	m0nk3ym4n	hunteke	I'm in synaptic what do I do?
2007-11-23T13:22:00.000Z	hunteke	m0nk3ym4n	urm, hold on, let me open up mine
2007-11-23T13:24:00.000Z	hunteke	m0nk3ym4n	select the all filter on the left
2007-11-23T13:24:00.000Z	hunteke	m0nk3ym4n	then click on the S column (S == state, I think).  That should organize by installed and not installed
2007-11-23T13:29:00.000Z	m0nk3ym4n	hunteke	Haha thanks I just searched "sound" then selected them all and set for reinstalling
2007-11-23T13:29:00.000Z	hunteke	m0nk3ym4n	that may or may not do the trick, because reinstalling will just reinstall the binaries (I think), not the configurations, which is likely where the problem lies.  but, we'll see.
2007-11-23T13:30:00.000Z	m0nk3ym4n	hunteke	Do you think I should mark them all then completely remove then reinstall?
2007-11-23T13:30:00.000Z	m0nk3ym4n	hunteke	how do I purge them without doing it in terminal
2007-11-23T13:30:00.000Z	hunteke	m0nk3ym4n	that's the completely remove bit
2007-11-23T13:31:00.000Z	m0nk3ym4n	hunteke	But how do I completely remove then still remember what I completely removed to re add?
2007-11-23T13:31:00.000Z	m0nk3ym4n	hunteke	Restarting man thanks for the help
2007-11-23T13:32:00.000Z	hunteke	m0nk3ym4n	that is a rub.  you either have a good memory, or you write it down.  or perhaps you could uninstall, and that will ask you to unsintall ubuntu-desktop
2007-11-23T13:32:00.000Z	hunteke	m0nk3ym4n	then you can just reinstall ubuntu-desktop and that will take care of it.  I don't know.  I haven't done this. so I say again, at your own risk.
