2007-04-19T09:05:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Tarkus	That ought to do it, now just restart X
2007-04-19T09:06:00.000Z	Tarkus	Jordan_U	alright, thanks alot man. appreciate it :D
2007-04-19T09:06:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Tarkus	Did it work?
2007-04-19T09:06:00.000Z	Tarkus	Jordan_U	im trying now, brb
2007-04-19T09:10:00.000Z	Tarkus	Jordan_U	yep, its working now on 1680x1050
2007-04-19T09:11:00.000Z	Tarkus	Jordan_U	strange though when i have a transparent terminal window, and i drag/move it, it gets all jumpy with updating the BG image into the transparency Background, like its slow responce. i though that having proper graphics drivers would fix that. is it normal for it to do that?
2007-04-19T09:14:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Tarkus	That is because it isn't true transpareny, install Compiz ( or upgrade to Feisty ) and it will be instantaneous
2007-04-25T07:38:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Tarkus	Are you trying to write or just read?
2007-04-25T07:39:00.000Z	Tarkus	Jordan_U	i just want to move my files from my windows drive (ntfs) to my external drive.
2007-04-25T07:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Tarkus	What File system for the external drives?
2007-04-25T07:43:00.000Z	Tarkus	Jordan_U	its NTFS
2007-04-25T07:44:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Tarkus	Is this on Feisty?
2007-04-25T07:44:00.000Z	Tarkus	Jordan_U	yes im using the LiveCD though
2007-04-25T07:44:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Tarkus	Just install ntfs-config ( you can do that from the LiveCD if you have enough RAM )
2007-04-25T07:45:00.000Z	Tarkus	Jordan_U	i already installed it
2007-04-25T07:46:00.000Z	Tarkus	Jordan_U	do i need to ctrl+alt+backspace after i install it though?
2007-04-25T07:46:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Tarkus	Then go to Applications -> System Tools -> NTFS config and enable write for external drives
2007-04-25T07:47:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Tarkus	No, you only need to do that when you change something with the X server
2007-07-09T08:42:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Tarkus	You can install Ubuntu after windows, you will just need to restore GRUB after windows clobbers it
2007-07-09T08:42:00.000Z	Tarkus	Jordan_U	i know i can install ubuntu after windows, thats the way that works imediately afaik.. but my problem is that i have ubuntu installed now.. only ubuntu.. and i dont want to have to reinstall it, etc..
2007-07-09T08:43:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Tarkus	Why would you have to re-install it?
2007-07-09T08:44:00.000Z	Tarkus	Jordan_U	cause i though that it only works if you do windows and then ubuntu.. but now i see that you i can make grub work manually.
2007-07-09T08:44:00.000Z	Tarkus	Jordan_U	thanks ill look at that.
