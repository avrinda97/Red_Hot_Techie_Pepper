2008-12-27T14:15:00.000Z	histo	dios_here	and grub works fine.
2008-12-27T14:15:00.000Z	histo	dios_here	even booting to second drive etc... You just have to know how to set it up. You can even boot windows as a slave drive.
2008-12-27T14:17:00.000Z	histo	dios_here	not necessarily true. You can use windows boot.init possibly to boot ubuntu on a second drive if thats what you want?  But I don't know why you'd want to do that.
2008-12-27T14:17:00.000Z	dios_here	histo	I want to have my windows harddisk MBR untouched, in case the other is screwed then I can simply switch to it from BIOS
2008-12-27T14:18:00.000Z	histo	dios_here	getting that working would be much harder than just letting grub do it. If you want windows on a second drive and ubuntu on the first then I would recomend using grub and you have to edit the menu.1st to change some things so that windows doesn't think its on the second drive when it boots.
2008-12-27T14:18:00.000Z	histo	dios_here	then you would not want to use grub during the install.  You can edit hte boot.ini and accomplish the same thing. Let me find you link.
2008-12-27T14:19:00.000Z	histo	dios_here	but same problem. If windows drive is screwed then you would have to use grub boot disk or something.

2008-12-27T14:22:00.000Z	histo	dios_here	that would use windows boot.ini to control the dual boot functionality. If the windows partition crashed you could just use a grub boot disk to get to linux. THe smae if you were using grub and the linux partition crashed.  Or you could pop in a windows cd and fixmbr of the windows partition to get windows back.
2008-12-27T14:24:00.000Z	histo	dios_here	is that link what you were looking for?
2008-12-27T14:24:00.000Z	dios_here	histo	yes thanks man
2008-12-27T14:24:00.000Z	histo	dios_here	yes your dhcp problem is a noted bug in intrepid
2008-12-27T14:25:00.000Z	histo	dios_here	you can use /etc/network/interfaces and get around that issue.
2008-12-27T14:25:00.000Z	histo	dios_here	agreed. Its in the release notes.
2008-12-27T14:27:00.000Z	dios_here	histo	has it been fixed in 8.10? bytheway I installed the newest debian yesterday and it has the same problem.. it will not work even if you manually edit interfaces
2008-12-27T14:28:00.000Z	histo	dios_here	debian will work if you edit interfaces and disable network manager.  I'm not sure if that has been addressed in jaunty ask in #ubuntu+1
2008-12-27T14:28:00.000Z	histo	dios_here	ubuntu intrepid will work if you do the same. Let me check my settings because i9 have static here.
2008-12-27T14:29:00.000Z	histo	dios_here	yeah I edited the interfaces file and remove network manager from starting up.
2008-12-27T14:30:00.000Z	dios_here	histo	ok I see
2008-12-27T14:30:00.000Z	histo	dios_here	just run sudo update-rc.d -f NetworkManager remove after you've made the changes to interfaces
2008-12-27T14:30:00.000Z	dios_here	histo	thanks
2008-12-27T14:30:00.000Z	histo	dios_here	its a bug in this version of nm
2008-12-27T14:30:00.000Z	dios_here	histo	yes that makes sense
