2005-06-06T10:42:00.000Z	disquiet		I finally hit the end of my rope when I had a virus and windows update was hung up on 92% for 3 days and everything kept crashing
2005-06-06T10:42:00.000Z	disquiet		On a nearly new computer
2005-06-06T10:43:00.000Z	disquiet		does anyone know of a connection between linux and insomnia? I feel like I haven't slept in days.

2005-06-06T10:47:00.000Z	bob2	disquiet	only through friends who have to use it at work
