2008-01-13T09:17:00.000Z	nickrud	sp0ro1	sorry, got sidetracked.  for the borders,  alt-f2 metacity --replace should put them back
2008-01-13T09:18:00.000Z	sp0ro1	nickrud	Alright, I'll try that once the linux box reboots. :)
2008-01-13T09:32:00.000Z	nickrud	sp0ro1	try those steps I gave you, I've had that happen occasionally. Those apps (except gconfd-2, which takes sudo to kill) should not be there when you log out
2008-01-13T09:32:00.000Z	sp0ro1	nickrud	On it right now, thanks. :)
2008-01-13T09:35:00.000Z	sp0ro1	nickrud	Ugh, now I can't even type anything in tty1. Everything is slowing down. Let me double check and make sure there isn't something wrong with the cpu temps or the power supply real quick.
2008-01-13T09:36:00.000Z	sp0ro1	nickrud	CPU temp seems to be fine, running at 35c. I have no idea what I did with my tools to check the powersupply though. :x
2008-01-13T09:44:00.000Z	sp0ro1	nickrud	Hm I can no longer use the shutdown button to logout of the gnome session. Is there a terminal command to logoff x-server? or will alt+ctrl+backspace do the same thing essentially?
2008-01-13T09:44:00.000Z	nickrud	sp0ro1	yes, clt-alt-backspace does the same Be sure to save stuff first :)
2008-01-13T09:44:00.000Z	sp0ro1	nickrud	hehe
2008-01-13T09:47:00.000Z	sp0ro1	nickrud	I'm not sure alt+ctrl+backspace did what we wanted. tty1 shows 3 processes running compared to a huge list that ps -A showed when I ran it after just logging out. I think there is something really wrong going on with that box...like I said, the shutdown button no longer even loads the shutdown options screen.
2008-01-13T09:49:00.000Z	nickrud	sp0ro1	sounds like it. Try creating a new user and logging into that one, see if it works ok
2008-01-13T09:49:00.000Z	sp0ro1	nickrud	Will do
2008-01-13T09:53:00.000Z	sp0ro1	nickrud	Alright, there is definately something wrong with the GNOME Settings Daemon. A screen just popped up telling me so once I logged onto the new user. :P
2008-01-13T09:54:00.000Z	nickrud	sp0ro1	did you kill it when you were logged out?
2008-01-13T09:54:00.000Z	nickrud	sp0ro1	log out of all users, then killall gnome-settings-daemon
2008-01-13T09:54:00.000Z	sp0ro1	nickrud	Not to my knowledge, I will now though if you want.
2008-01-13T09:54:00.000Z	sp0ro1	nickrud	Ok
2008-01-13T09:54:00.000Z	nickrud	sp0ro1	it would have been one of the things you killed if you did my earlier suggestion
2008-01-13T09:55:00.000Z	sp0ro1	nickrud	Only processes I killed that were running were gnome-vfs-daemon and gconfd-2
2008-01-13T09:56:00.000Z	nickrud	sp0ro1	gnome-settings-daemon wasn't running when you logged out? That's good, but how about now when you log in?
2008-01-13T09:56:00.000Z	sp0ro1	nickrud	I don't know, even the tty's are stalling now. :(
2008-01-13T09:56:00.000Z	sp0ro1	nickrud	I have to reboot that box real quick, hold on.
2008-01-13T09:57:00.000Z	nickrud	sp0ro1	I gotta go, be back in an hour or so
2008-01-13T09:57:00.000Z	sp0ro1	nickrud	kk thank you for your help.
