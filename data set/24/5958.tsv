2006-03-18T12:33:00.000Z	fluxt		does anyone else have the problem where they don't see what people are typing unless they type your name first?
2006-03-18T12:34:00.000Z	Madpilot	fluxt	which IRC app are you using?
2006-03-18T12:34:00.000Z	fluxt	Madpilot	even... xchat
2006-03-18T12:35:00.000Z	Madpilot	fluxt	odd - try quiting & restarting xchat
2006-03-18T12:35:00.000Z	fluxt	Madpilot	why?
2006-03-18T12:35:00.000Z	Madpilot	fluxt	because restarting often cures odd behaviours :P
2006-03-18T12:36:00.000Z	fluxt	Madpilot	i don't get you
2006-03-18T12:37:00.000Z	Madpilot	fluxt	exit XChat, restart it, and see if it keeps doing the odd behaviour, that's all
2006-03-18T12:37:00.000Z	fluxt	Madpilot	what odd behaviour?
2006-03-18T12:38:00.000Z	Madpilot	fluxt	"does anyone else have the problem where they don't see what people are typing unless they type your name first?" <-- that one
2006-03-24T15:00:00.000Z	Madpilot	fluxt	if you've pm'd the bot, "<new thing> is <blather>"
2006-03-24T15:01:00.000Z	fluxt	Madpilot	yeah, it remembers but doesn't spit anything back
2006-03-24T15:01:00.000Z	Madpilot	fluxt	what've you added?
2006-03-24T15:02:00.000Z	fluxt	Madpilot	i added Lynx
2006-03-24T15:03:00.000Z	Madpilot	fluxt	yeah, http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/ has it listed, but it won't display
2006-03-24T15:04:00.000Z	fluxt	Madpilot	is that the web based version?
2006-03-24T15:04:00.000Z	fluxt	Madpilot	ahh nice
2006-03-24T15:06:00.000Z	Madpilot	fluxt	the bot's acting rather odd...
2006-03-24T15:06:00.000Z	fluxt	Madpilot	ahh ok, probably needs a restart
2006-03-24T15:07:00.000Z	Madpilot	fluxt	no idea. You could /memo cafeugo, it's his bot
2006-03-24T15:56:00.000Z	Madpilot	fluxt	see the URL I just posted for frank__ ^^^
2006-03-24T15:56:00.000Z	Madpilot	fluxt	actually, nevermind, usplash isn't covered there
2006-03-24T16:34:00.000Z	Madpilot	fluxt	install Baobab - it's a little Nautilus plugin app - if you want a graphical way of looking at directory sizes
