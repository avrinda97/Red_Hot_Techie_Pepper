2005-07-06T07:52:00.000Z	LinuxNewbie		hello
2005-07-06T07:53:00.000Z	LinuxNewbie		can ubuntu like specify the users who will be shared with the internet connection?
2005-07-06T07:53:00.000Z	LinuxNewbie		is that possible?
2005-07-06T07:54:00.000Z	LinuxNewbie		to specify specific users that will recieve internet connections
2005-07-06T07:54:00.000Z	CarlFK	LinuxNewbie	- huh?
2005-07-06T07:55:00.000Z	CarlFK	LinuxNewbie	- are you thinking of an internet caffee, where people have to pay to get access?
2005-07-06T07:56:00.000Z	CarlFK	LinuxNewbie	- how is that different than the internet caffee?  (other than they don't pay you)
2005-07-06T07:58:00.000Z	CarlFK	LinuxNewbie	- basicaly, you want the same thing.
2005-07-06T07:59:00.000Z	CarlFK	LinuxNewbie	- yes.  many
2005-07-06T07:59:00.000Z	CarlFK	LinuxNewbie	- easiest thing that comes to mind is Squid
2005-07-06T07:59:00.000Z	CarlFK	LinuxNewbie	- hmm, that will just proxy web trafic... do you need full access, or just web browsing?
2005-07-06T08:02:00.000Z	CarlFK	LinuxNewbie	- I think you need to browse sf.net ...  I was looking for something like this about 6 months ago, there are about 50 relevent projects
2005-07-06T08:07:00.000Z	CarlFK	LinuxNewbie	- check out http://linus.yhspatriot.net/cs/docs/ubuntu_howto/UbuntuLTSPInstall
2005-07-06T08:08:00.000Z	CarlFK	LinuxNewbie	- somewhere areound there it talks about systems like what you are kinda talking about
2005-07-06T08:08:00.000Z	CarlFK	LinuxNewbie	- I think you need to document what you are really trying to achieve
2005-07-06T08:14:00.000Z	CarlFK	LinuxNewbie	- none of the popular distros are going to even come close to what you seem to be looking for
2005-07-06T08:15:00.000Z	CarlFK	LinuxNewbie	- hows that documention coming?
2005-07-06T08:17:00.000Z	CarlFK	LinuxNewbie	- you must have skipped sf.net in your search
2005-07-06T08:18:00.000Z	CarlFK	LinuxNewbie	- document what you need, then /join #iptables
2005-07-06T08:19:00.000Z	CarlFK	LinuxNewbie	- put that on a web page and be prepared to add to it - you are about 1/4 done
2005-07-06T08:21:00.000Z	CarlFK	LinuxNewbie	- look in sf.net again.  what you want is there - it may just take some searching to find it
2005-07-06T08:21:00.000Z	CarlFK	LinuxNewbie	- and stop calling machiens users
2005-07-06T08:24:00.000Z	CarlFK	LinuxNewbie	- make up you mind, document it, have it handy for people to read....
2005-07-06T08:25:00.000Z	CarlFK	LinuxNewbie	- your project is a bit too complex to describe in a few IRC lines
