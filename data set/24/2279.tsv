2009-07-12T16:04:00.000Z	T3Roar		somebody help! i'm stuck in workspace 2 and I can't switch  back to the normal one :\
2009-07-12T16:04:00.000Z	mzz	T3Roar	iirc the default binding is ctrl+alt+arrow left
2009-07-12T16:04:00.000Z	T3Roar	mzz	i've tried that, but it's not working
2009-07-12T16:04:00.000Z	mzz	T3Roar	or you can click in the pager thing on the panel (add one if it's not there)
2009-07-12T16:05:00.000Z	T3Roar	mzz	my panel has disappeared too!
2009-07-12T16:05:00.000Z	mzz	T3Roar	start a new one
2009-07-12T16:05:00.000Z	T3Roar	mzz	how?
2009-07-12T16:05:00.000Z	mzz	T3Roar	do you still have a terminal or a way to get one? Does alt+f2 still work?
2009-07-12T16:06:00.000Z	T3Roar	mzz	yes, i have the run box
2009-07-12T16:06:00.000Z	mzz	T3Roar	run gnome-panel
2009-07-12T16:07:00.000Z	T3Roar	mzz	it doesn't bring up the panel
2009-07-12T16:07:00.000Z	mzz	T3Roar	ugh. sec.
2009-07-12T16:08:00.000Z	T3Roar	mzz	it did run the command, but i'm quite sure this workspace is not working how it should be, i think it's something to do with compiz-config
2009-07-12T16:08:00.000Z	mzz	T3Roar	yeah, sounds like your wm is confused (the panel's still running, you just can't see it). Perhaps run "compiz --replace" or "metacity --replace"?
2009-07-12T16:10:00.000Z	T3Roar	mzz	i did and now it lets me switch between workspaces, but the panel is still hidden
2009-07-12T16:10:00.000Z	T3Roar	mzz	is there a command to show the panel?
2009-07-12T16:10:00.000Z	mzz	T3Roar	I don't use gnome enough to find that one quickly
2009-07-12T16:11:00.000Z	mzz	T3Roar	can you check if gnome-panel is running (launch gnome-system-monitor to check)
2009-07-12T16:11:00.000Z	T3Roar	mzz	yes it is
2009-07-12T16:11:00.000Z	mzz	T3Roar	the problem is I normally get at its configuration by right-clicking a blank spot on the panel, which is hard if there isn't one :)
2009-07-12T16:12:00.000Z	T3Roar	mzz	it's just empty space and nothing happens when i right click anywhere on the background
2009-07-12T16:13:00.000Z	T3Roar	mzz	i've just done gnome-panel --replace and it worked
2009-07-12T16:16:00.000Z	T3Roar	mzz	my desktop's gone now, i can't see my icons
2009-07-12T16:17:00.000Z	T3Roar	mzz	i'm just going to restart and see what's going on then, thank you for your help :)
