2007-12-31T19:13:00.000Z	Pici	th0r	er, not really.
2007-12-31T19:17:00.000Z	th0r	Pici	be careful with the word 'no'...all those things and more are covered in the two references.
2007-12-31T19:18:00.000Z	Pici	th0r	Perhaps I misunderstood your answer then, apologies.
2008-01-10T19:04:00.000Z	Pici	th0r	comment out in what? Its much more efficient to use update-rc.d
2008-01-10T19:04:00.000Z	th0r	Pici	fair enough....learn something new every day
2008-01-10T19:05:00.000Z	th0r	Pici	my notes are based on changing the default dm....figured if there isn't a default....it will not start x
2008-01-10T19:06:00.000Z	th0r	Pici	I think update-rc.d will do the same thing basically
2008-01-10T19:06:00.000Z	Pici	th0r	update-rc.d will tell it to not start anything, rather than trying to start something and erroring out.
2008-01-10T19:06:00.000Z	Pici	th0r	or not erroring out, nevermind.
2008-01-10T19:07:00.000Z	th0r	Pici	interesting, all the rc.d script links for gdm call Kxxgdm....call gdm with the 'kill' switch
2008-01-14T19:10:00.000Z	th0r	Pici	 actually locate is inmy experience faster than find
2008-01-18T23:26:00.000Z	Pici	th0r	No, its an ubuntu problem.
2008-01-18T23:27:00.000Z	th0r	Pici	nope...no pm sorry. thought error 403 Forbidden came from apache...sorry bout that too
2008-01-18T23:28:00.000Z	Pici	th0r	Its because one of the files needed for the security update has been disabled due to a bug.  Updates will fail now, but at least we aren't really breaking systems like we were before.
2008-01-18T23:29:00.000Z	th0r	Pici	ah...then it is coming via the web interface...but is an ubuntu problem. OK...thanks
2008-06-24T23:36:00.000Z	Pici	th0r	Probably in /usr/share/doc/abs-guide
2008-07-18T18:45:00.000Z	th0r	Pici	#xubuntu has the same problem
2008-07-18T18:45:00.000Z	Pici	th0r	thank you
2009-07-24T20:42:00.000Z	th0r	Pici	is right...no need for -r as nothing really exists except the link /boot/boot
2011-07-28T22:49:00.000Z	Pici	th0r	It should be installed by default in Ubuntu.
2011-07-28T22:50:00.000Z	th0r	Pici	guess I should get my ubuntu vm installed again <smile>
2011-08-04T19:59:00.000Z	th0r	Pici	that's a shame, first time I was ever at the top of a list
2011-09-20T16:36:00.000Z	Pici	th0r	thats incorrect.
2011-09-20T16:36:00.000Z	Pici	th0r	root exists, its account is just locked.
