2009-05-18T00:24:00.000Z	dylan_		anyone know how to make / use modelines ? for some reason any Linux installations I try are unable to give me the full resolution (1280 x 1024) like my hardware was intended to (and which works in winXP no probs).
2009-05-18T00:25:00.000Z	dylan_		I have a nvidia 8800 gt, and a 17 " screen with max resolution 1280 x 1024, but I don't know how to generate a modeline for this hardware combination

2009-05-18T00:44:00.000Z	Slart	dylan_	you could also try one of the standard ones from this site http://linux.50webs.org/resources/modelines.htm
2009-05-18T01:31:00.000Z	dylan_	Slart	did you ever figure out that modeline stuff ?

2009-05-18T01:33:00.000Z	dylan_	Slart	do I use xrandr for this, or put in my xorg.conf ?
2009-05-18T01:33:00.000Z	Slart	dylan_	I would put it in the xorg.conf
2009-05-18T01:36:00.000Z	dylan_	Slart	does the modeline go under "monitor" or "screen" ?
2009-05-18T01:36:00.000Z	Slart	dylan_	here are some examples.. http://www.viajes-abaco.com/m400a/xorg_conf.htm

2009-05-18T01:40:00.000Z	Slart	dylan_	I haven't done this in at least 2 years.. you could check "man xorg.conf" for some up to date info
