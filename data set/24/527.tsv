2011-07-06T19:18:00.000Z	tzhuang		Can anyone help me get youtube working in Chrome on Ubuntu 11.04?
2011-07-06T19:18:00.000Z	tzhuang		I have falshplugins and ubuntu-restricted-extras installed.
2011-07-06T19:19:00.000Z	sipior	tzhuang	chrome comes with its own flash plugin, as i recall. what happens if you point your browser to about:plugins ?
2011-07-06T19:22:00.000Z	tzhuang	sipior	I'm not sure what you mean by point my browser to about:plugins.
2011-07-06T19:22:00.000Z	sipior	tzhuang	type "about:plugins" in the address bar.
2011-07-06T19:23:00.000Z	tzhuang	sipior	it says I have flash
2011-07-06T19:24:00.000Z	tzhuang	sipior	Flash(2 files) - Version: 10.3.181
2011-07-06T19:24:00.000Z	sipior	tzhuang	the details button will show more useful information
2011-07-06T19:24:00.000Z	tzhuang	sipior	Do you need me to paste you the detailed information for the flash plugin?
2011-07-06T19:25:00.000Z	sipior	tzhuang	if you like. please use a pastebin, though.
2011-07-06T19:26:00.000Z	tzhuang	sipior	I'm new to both irc and irssi. What is a pastebin?
2011-07-06T19:30:00.000Z	tzhuang	sipior	hmm not too sure if this is what the instructions meant
2011-07-06T19:30:00.000Z	tzhuang	sipior	!pastebinit http://paste.ubuntu.com/638930/
2011-07-06T19:30:00.000Z	sipior	tzhuang	that's it, thank you (no need for the "!pastebinit", though :-)
2011-07-06T19:31:00.000Z	tzhuang	sipior	haha okay thanks
2011-07-06T19:32:00.000Z	sipior	tzhuang	can you disable the plugin located at "/usr/lib/flashplugin-installer/libflashplayer.so"? there should be a button located below the entry.
2011-07-06T19:33:00.000Z	tzhuang	sipior	okay i disabled it? do i need to restart browser?
2011-07-06T19:33:00.000Z	sipior	tzhuang	please.
2011-07-06T19:35:00.000Z	tzhuang	sipior	hmm same effect as before. video window is just a black squre
2011-07-06T19:38:00.000Z	sipior	tzhuang	hmm. you might consider trying this: http://whatan00b.com/enabling-flash-in-chrome-on-ubuntu-10-04
2011-07-06T19:38:00.000Z	sipior	tzhuang	you got chrome from the ubuntu repository, i guess?
