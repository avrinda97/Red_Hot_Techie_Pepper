2007-12-04T18:24:00.000Z	logyati		hi guys... im trying to customize ubuntu. i did all i had to do, but there's one thing left and i dont know how to do it. When i install ubuntu from livecd, it creates the menu.lst with the name UBUNTU. i wanna change it at installation time... what should i do? btw, im using 7.04
2007-12-04T18:25:00.000Z	ikonia	logyati	you need to change the a lot to make the default name differ
2007-12-04T18:26:00.000Z	logyati	ikonia	what u mean?
2007-12-04T18:26:00.000Z	ikonia	logyati	why do you want to change the name "ubuntu" from the menu.lst
2007-12-04T18:26:00.000Z	ikonia	logyati	you'd have to change the grub package to change the name at install of the creation of the menu.lst
2007-12-04T18:27:00.000Z	logyati	ikonia	cos i made a distro customized, it cant have this name at menu.lst
2007-12-04T18:28:00.000Z	ikonia	logyati	can you explain a little more, what do you mean a customised distro ?
2007-12-04T18:28:00.000Z	logyati	ikonia	even using the live cd, should i work with grub package? i thought there was a place where i could find this entry and change to another name, inside livecd. then, everytime i install it comes with the name i choosed
2007-12-04T18:29:00.000Z	ikonia	logyati	no, as it is generated dynamiclly
2007-12-04T18:29:00.000Z	logyati	ikonia	i work for the government. we decided to make our distro, called LIVRE.RJ. Im using ubuntu and reconstructor to do it.
2007-12-04T18:29:00.000Z	ikonia	logyati	does that fall in line with the ubuntu license ?
2007-12-04T18:30:00.000Z	logyati	ikonia	yes, dont worry
2007-12-04T18:31:00.000Z	logyati	ikonia	im trying to do it... grub install detects the kernel name and version i think... then it puts UBUNTU at menu.lst
2007-12-04T18:32:00.000Z	ikonia	logyati	yes, thats right,
2007-12-04T18:32:00.000Z	logyati	ikonia	but there  is no UBUNTU in uname -a
2007-12-04T18:32:00.000Z	ikonia	logyati	does it work it out from uname -a ?
2007-12-04T18:32:00.000Z	ikonia	logyati	I didn't think it did
2007-12-04T18:33:00.000Z	logyati	ikonia	hmmm... well i dont know what to do :(
2007-12-04T18:33:00.000Z	ikonia	logyati	open up the grub package and see what it does
2007-12-04T18:33:00.000Z	logyati	ikonia	ok :)
2007-12-04T18:33:00.000Z	ikonia	logyati	did you see IdleOne's suggestion
2007-12-04T18:34:00.000Z	logyati	ikonia	where is it?
