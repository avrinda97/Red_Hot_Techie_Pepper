2006-11-11T08:22:00.000Z	roryy	madsen	this channel is for ubuntu. afaik, ubuntu uses utf-8 for most (all?) applications
2006-11-11T08:22:00.000Z	madsen	roryy	i know.. using xubuntu... think i've tried almost everything
2006-11-11T08:23:00.000Z	roryy	madsen	you have a iso-8859-1 encoded file?
2006-11-11T08:24:00.000Z	madsen	roryy	ehmm should i?  shouldn't it be supported default?
2006-11-11T08:25:00.000Z	roryy	madsen	i'm not sure, but i suspect utf-8 would be better
2006-11-11T08:25:00.000Z	madsen	roryy	everything else works fine in danish... but in irssi/ssh it just wont show right
2006-11-11T08:26:00.000Z	roryy	madsen	what machine are you ssh'ing into? also ubuntu, or something else?
2006-11-11T08:27:00.000Z	madsen	roryy	a normal debian....works fine on that on local and via win32/putty
2006-11-11T08:27:00.000Z	roryy	madsen	i had issues using putty ssh'ing into an ubuntu machine until i told putty to use utf-8
2006-11-11T08:28:00.000Z	roryy	madsen	maybe you can ask either ssh or irssi to work in utf-8; maybe 'LANG=dk_DK.UTF-8 irssi'  (that's a guess)
2006-11-11T08:28:00.000Z	madsen	roryy	my problem is that danish charset has 3 special letters which the english alpabet does't have... they are screwed
2006-11-11T08:29:00.000Z	madsen	roryy	I dont know how?  any clue?
2006-11-11T08:29:00.000Z	roryy	madsen	my limited understanding of the problem is that your debian system is outputting chars in iso-8859-1, and ubuntu is interpreting them as utf-8
2006-11-11T08:30:00.000Z	madsen	roryy	youre absolute correct.. that my problem hes
2006-11-11T08:30:00.000Z	roryy	madsen	can you try launching irssi with that LANG setting? Like this:   'LANG=dk_DK.UTF-8 irssi'
2006-11-11T08:30:00.000Z	madsen	roryy	how do i set lang in irssi?
2006-11-11T08:32:00.000Z	roryy	madsen	well, I suggest just trying the 'LANG=dk_DK.UTF-8 irrsi' option; if that doesn't work, I'm out of ideas
2006-11-11T08:33:00.000Z	roryy	madsen	otherwise pester gnomefreak for irssi help -- I use erc ;)
2006-11-11T08:33:00.000Z	madsen	roryy	erc?
2006-11-11T08:33:00.000Z	roryy	madsen	emacs irc client
2006-11-11T08:36:00.000Z	roryy	madsen	try it already and tell us what happens ;). I'm curious
2006-11-11T08:38:00.000Z	roryy	madsen	ideally you want a da_DK.UTF-8
