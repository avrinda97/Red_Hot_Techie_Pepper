2011-07-03T22:34:00.000Z	jonny		kinda, i didn't really look into it that much
2011-07-03T22:35:00.000Z	jonny		iv looked in the bios i couldn't find anything memory related, and all the ram is the same kind...   sorry thanks for helping
2011-07-03T22:35:00.000Z	jonny		if anyone else could help thatd be cool
2011-07-03T22:35:00.000Z	magusOTB	jonny	what are you trying to do?
2011-07-03T22:36:00.000Z	jonny		i installed ubuntu 64 bit and i want to use all 7 gigs of ram
2011-07-03T22:36:00.000Z	jonny		but "free" only shows 3.6 gigs
2011-07-03T22:36:00.000Z	magusOTB		does cat /proc/meminfo show all of it?
2011-07-03T22:37:00.000Z	jonny		first line of that command was "MemTotal: 3.6..blah so no
2011-07-03T22:38:00.000Z	magusOTB	jonny	Are you sure it's installed properly? I'm not entirely sure that a modern dual channel system would like a number like 7.
2011-07-03T22:39:00.000Z	jonny		well it at least as 3 sticks of 2 gigs each
2011-07-03T22:39:00.000Z	jonny		*has
2011-07-03T22:39:00.000Z	magusOTB	jonny	and where does the extra one come from?
2011-07-03T22:39:00.000Z	jonny		its another stick, 1 gig
2011-07-03T22:39:00.000Z	jonny		4 slots
2011-07-03T22:40:00.000Z	magusOTB		What is your motherboard?
2011-07-03T22:40:00.000Z	jonny		eh, im not sure
2011-07-03T22:41:00.000Z	jonny	magusOTB	in bios i saw it recognized 7 gigs
2011-07-03T22:41:00.000Z	magusOTB	jonny	How did you install ram without consulting the manual to figure out what slots should be populated?
2011-07-03T22:42:00.000Z	jonny		heh, i knew my board took DDR2 ram, so I bought DDR2 ram and put them in..........
2011-07-03T22:43:00.000Z	magusOTB	jonny	Some boards are picky about their ram configuration. It's worth looking into if nothing else works.
