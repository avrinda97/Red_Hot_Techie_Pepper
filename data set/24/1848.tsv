2012-04-26T08:29:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	wylde	that would REPLACE the text. to ADD a line, use >>
2012-04-26T08:29:00.000Z	wylde	DarwinSurvivor	I know :) I was getting there, you can use > to an empty file
2012-05-08T05:53:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	wylde	fluxbox should bring xorg in as a dependency automatically
2012-05-08T05:53:00.000Z	wylde	DarwinSurvivor	"should" I've actually seen people install a WM and had no xserver
2012-05-08T05:54:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	wylde	wow, didn't know that was possible!
2012-05-08T05:55:00.000Z	wylde	DarwinSurvivor	it was last week? Maybe the week before someone was in here having wm issues. Turned out the realized they had no x.
2012-05-08T05:55:00.000Z	wylde	DarwinSurvivor	I don't recall the WM though.
2012-05-09T05:03:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	wylde	you can't have a file and a folder and a file with the same name, so line 1 will fail
2012-05-09T05:03:00.000Z	wylde	DarwinSurvivor	so true, my bad
2012-05-09T09:03:00.000Z	wylde	DarwinSurvivor	ubukou : http://paste.ubuntu.com/977286/    <--- this seems to work. I assume you can launch a script from thunar? ( I know I didn't quote my variables but I'm a bash nub anyway) :P
2012-05-09T09:04:00.000Z	wylde	DarwinSurvivor	ubukou : and I suppose the extension variable is useless but the if you wanted to extend the functioality.
2012-05-09T09:08:00.000Z	wylde	DarwinSurvivor	ubukou : mine should work with empty files :P and removes the extension from the directory name
2012-05-09T09:09:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	wylde	mine should work with empty files as well, I find it VERY weird that it doesn't...
2012-05-09T09:09:00.000Z	wylde	DarwinSurvivor	yeah, that is strange.
2012-05-09T09:11:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	wylde	yep, my script works 100% from the terminal, thunar must has some kind of issue with empty files and the %n variable
2012-05-09T09:12:00.000Z	wylde	DarwinSurvivor	yep, has to be the app, I would imagine.
2012-05-14T02:42:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	wylde	jpsman you could use a "while read filename" style bash loop to perform the search
2012-05-14T03:17:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	wylde	please pastebin the output of "mount" there's a decent chance it is using a ramdisk or encrypted /tmp already
2012-05-14T03:17:00.000Z	wylde	DarwinSurvivor	?
2012-05-14T03:19:00.000Z	wylde	DarwinSurvivor	if I do that you'll see my bad practice uses of sshfs >.>
2012-05-14T03:22:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	wylde	sorry that was for TemporaryName123 :P
2012-05-14T03:22:00.000Z	wylde	DarwinSurvivor	:)
