2007-02-27T07:38:00.000Z	finalbeta		just use the .sys from your orriginal cd, I did.
2007-02-27T07:40:00.000Z	finalbeta		A broken IDE connection caused a ext3 file system to become unrecognized. Any way to recover from this?
2007-02-27T07:40:00.000Z	ikonia_	finalbeta	is it damaged
2007-02-27T07:42:00.000Z	ikonia_	finalbeta	not sure on that - sounds like the disk has a problem rather than the file system
2007-02-27T07:44:00.000Z	ikonia_	finalbeta	what makes you think (or is the clue) that the file system is corrupted
2007-02-27T07:46:00.000Z	finalbeta	ikonia_	like I said, the disk was inside a HD removable case. the connectors of that failed, the disks spinned down and up made beeps etc. I think the power connector failed, but possible one of the print circuits caused data corruption. When attaching the disk directly to the internal ide cable, the disks runs fine. But the partition is now unrecognized.
2007-02-27T07:46:00.000Z	ikonia_	finalbeta	so your partition table is in trouble - not your file system
2007-02-27T07:47:00.000Z	finalbeta	ikonia_	possibly, I can only hope so.
2007-02-27T07:47:00.000Z	finalbeta	ikonia_	 Can I force it back to ext3
2007-02-27T07:49:00.000Z	ikonia_	finalbeta	 the partition table has nothing to do with ext3
2007-02-27T07:49:00.000Z	ikonia_	finalbeta	show me the output of fdisk -l $devicefile
2007-02-27T07:52:00.000Z	ikonia_	finalbeta	that partition looks fine
2007-02-27T07:53:00.000Z	finalbeta	ikonia_	gparted shows it as unrecognized.
2007-02-27T07:53:00.000Z	ikonia_	finalbeta	well - try mounting it
2007-02-27T07:53:00.000Z	finalbeta	ikonia_	what are the standard ext3 fix tools?
2007-02-27T07:54:00.000Z	ikonia_	finalbeta	before you worry about that - try moounting
2007-02-27T07:57:00.000Z	ikonia_	finalbeta	don't ever pm me again with a flood
2007-02-27T07:57:00.000Z	ikonia_	finalbeta	don't pm me without asking

2007-02-27T08:00:00.000Z	ikonia_	finalbeta	2 questions 1.) why do you have an extended partition for thispartition, - why is it called hdb5 - what happened to hdb2,3,4 - have you tried to resize this partition at all
2007-02-27T08:06:00.000Z	ikonia_	finalbeta	something has gnoe very wrong
2007-02-27T08:07:00.000Z	finalbeta	ikonia_	Yeah, that much I found out on my own ;)
2007-02-27T08:09:00.000Z	finalbeta	ikonia_	going to run some recovery tools on it. See what pans out.
2007-02-27T10:02:00.000Z	finalbeta	ikonia_	http://www.data-recovery-software.net/Linux_Recovery.shtml seems to at least see all files on the broken partition. I've ordered a drive, will see if I can recover files from it once it arrives.
