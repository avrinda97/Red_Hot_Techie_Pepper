2009-04-19T17:42:00.000Z	loca|host		hello all
2009-04-19T17:43:00.000Z	loca|host		i have a wireless connection done on my laptop, and now i want to use it on another computer, but i have forgotten the WPA key ... anyone know where i can find it on my laptop ? since ubuntu should store it in cleartext
2009-04-19T17:44:00.000Z	Polterge|st	loca|host	 this is a valid use for aircrack
2009-04-19T17:44:00.000Z	Polterge|st		personal self security / key retrieval
2009-04-19T17:44:00.000Z	Polterge|st		there is nothing unethical about using it for that
2009-04-19T17:45:00.000Z	loca|host	Polterge|st	i thought aircrack is for hacking an unknown Wifi point, in my case, its my own Wifi point and i wont reset it just to put a  new WPA key in it
2009-04-19T17:45:00.000Z	Polterge|st	loca|host	no you are mistaken
2009-04-19T17:45:00.000Z	Polterge|st		it is for hacking any wifi point
2009-04-19T17:45:00.000Z	Polterge|st		even your own
2009-04-19T17:46:00.000Z	Polterge|st		and to hack your own is a legit reason
2009-04-19T17:46:00.000Z	Polterge|st	loca|host	and you don't need to reset the key
2009-04-19T17:46:00.000Z	Polterge|st		if it is WEP it can crack it pretty fast
2009-04-19T17:46:00.000Z	Polterge|st		you need about 60,000 packets
2009-04-19T17:46:00.000Z	Polterge|st		WPA takes a long time
2009-04-19T17:46:00.000Z	Polterge|st		this didn't come from me though
2009-04-19T17:46:00.000Z	loca|host	Polterge|st	but it takes too much time to get the password :( i cant wait too long when i know (?) the password is saved in clear on my laptop :)
2009-04-19T17:48:00.000Z	Polterge|st	loca|host	that is just it though... it is probably shadowed
2009-04-19T17:48:00.000Z	Polterge|st		unless you know of a good way to decrypt that
2009-04-19T17:48:00.000Z	Polterge|st		I doubt it is in the /etc folder
2009-04-19T17:48:00.000Z	loca|host	Polterge|st	its stored using gnome-keyring
2009-04-19T17:48:00.000Z	Polterge|st		ah
2009-04-19T17:48:00.000Z	Polterge|st		you might be able to find it then
2009-04-19T17:49:00.000Z	Polterge|st		possibly
2009-04-19T17:49:00.000Z	Polterge|st	loca|host	just google to find out where gnome key ring stores passwords
