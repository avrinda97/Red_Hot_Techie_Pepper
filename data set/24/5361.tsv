2006-08-07T08:12:00.000Z	trippen		not correct, you can update the md5sum entry executing the following
2006-08-07T08:12:00.000Z	trippen		command:
2006-08-07T08:12:00.000Z	trippen		md5sum /etc/X11/xorg.conf | sudo tee /var/lib/x11/xorg.conf.md5sum

2006-08-07T08:13:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	trippen	do the part after 'otherwise...'
2006-08-07T08:14:00.000Z	trippen	fyrestrtr	. so that is normal i can proceed to the restart of X
2006-08-07T08:15:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	trippen	well, did you make the change as it stated?
2006-08-07T08:16:00.000Z	trippen	fyrestrtr	 i followed the directions.. on the page it does not say that i will get an error after typing  sudo nvidia-glx-config enable
2006-08-07T08:16:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	trippen	don't worry about that part, just open up /etc/X11/xorg.conf -- and then change "nv" to "nvidia", save the file, and restart X
2006-08-07T08:17:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	trippen	gksudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf <-- type that at a console
2006-08-07T08:17:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	trippen	hit alt+f2 -- in the window that pops up, type gksudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf -- and hit Run
2006-08-07T08:18:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	trippen	when the file is open, scroll down to where you see Section "Device"
2006-08-07T08:19:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	trippen	below that, you'll see Driver "nv" -- change nv to nvidia, so it reads Driver "nvidia"
2006-08-07T08:19:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	trippen	then save the file, close everything, and hit ctrl+alt+backspace to restart your X server.
