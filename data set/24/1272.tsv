2010-04-16T10:12:00.000Z	TyanColte		anybody have anything to say about my question?
2010-04-16T10:13:00.000Z	TyanColte		for some reason when my monitor goes off after a while, i turn it back on and my wifi is hardware blocked in "rfkill list" the only thing i can do to reset it is restart my computer, any ideas?
2010-04-16T10:15:00.000Z	TyanColte		yay virtual box
2010-04-16T10:16:00.000Z	TyanColte		i've been thinking about making ubuntu my primary OS but if i can't get all the kinks worked out it'll never be
2010-04-16T10:16:00.000Z	crucialhoax	TyanColte	It sounds like the wifi card will not come out of sleep. Is there a bug filed for this?
2010-04-16T10:18:00.000Z	crucialhoax	TyanColte	Meh, that could be why right there. Wubi is nothing but trouble. If you want to try Ubuntu just use the live cd or usb stick.
2010-04-16T10:19:00.000Z	crucialhoax	TyanColte	The live cd does not touch the harddrive...
2010-04-16T10:20:00.000Z	TyanColte	crucialhoax	i meant to direct that last one to you
2010-04-16T10:20:00.000Z	TyanColte	crucialhoax	"i understand that but you are restricted to the speed of your cd rom drive" to requote
2010-04-16T10:21:00.000Z	crucialhoax	TyanColte	True, but if you want to see if the suspend issue persists, I would see if it does it while in a live environment.
2010-04-16T10:22:00.000Z	TyanColte	crucialhoax	technically a wubi installation IS a live environment the only thing that differs is a virutal hard drive
2010-04-16T10:25:00.000Z	TyanColte	crucialhoax	see what i mean?
2010-04-16T10:26:00.000Z	TyanColte	crucialhoax	ya still with me?
2010-04-16T10:26:00.000Z	crucialhoax	TyanColte	Yes, but it seems that Wubi has not gotten its stuff right yet.
2010-04-16T10:27:00.000Z	TyanColte	crucialhoax	it's getting very close, i mean i've seen no difference in performance between a partition install and a wubi install with the exception of grub not being in the way, i detest grub
2010-04-16T10:28:00.000Z	crucialhoax	TyanColte	There are ways to have Windows and Linux on the same drive... Sometimes painful tho.
2010-04-16T10:28:00.000Z	TyanColte	crucialhoax	wubi is the least painful of all ways and it is the easiest
2010-04-16T10:38:00.000Z	crucialhoax	TyanColte	ubottu Just stated that Grub2 is default since 9.10...
2010-04-16T10:38:00.000Z	crucialhoax	TyanColte	Maybe cuz its a Wubi?
2010-04-16T10:39:00.000Z	crucialhoax	TyanColte	I just like to blame wubi ;]
2010-04-16T10:43:00.000Z	crucialhoax	TyanColte	Lots of problems with grub2 and Wubi it seems. Maybe that is why the used an old version?
2010-04-16T10:43:00.000Z	TyanColte	crucialhoax	interesting, maybe they know something that we don't :P
2010-04-16T10:43:00.000Z	crucialhoax	TyanColte	Possible. Lots of forums threads and bug reports.
2010-04-16T10:47:00.000Z	crucialhoax	TyanColte	Wubi broke my Windows sound... its just a weird instance of testing.
