2008-04-15T02:29:00.000Z	sagredo		YO! Whilst in the command line, when I enter a long string of characters, how can I instantly jump to the very front of the line?
2008-04-15T02:29:00.000Z	nickrud	sagredo	 ctl-a should do it
2008-06-11T07:06:00.000Z	sagredo	nickrud	you've done a lot for this community, thank you
2009-02-07T09:12:00.000Z	sagredo	nickrud	how long did it take you to learn everything
2009-02-07T09:13:00.000Z	nickrud	sagredo	someday I expect to be competent
2009-02-07T09:13:00.000Z	nickrud	sagredo	but probably after a year or so I knew enough to know how to answer my own questions
2009-02-07T09:14:00.000Z	sagredo	nickrud	how long ago was that first year... just curious, I remember seeing you here quite some years ago
2009-02-07T09:14:00.000Z	nickrud	sagredo	my first ever linux install? March 19, 2000 :)
2009-02-07T09:14:00.000Z	sagredo	nickrud	what continent are you located on?
2009-02-07T09:15:00.000Z	nickrud	sagredo	Los Angeles CA
2009-02-07T09:15:00.000Z	nickrud	sagredo	no, I know no one personally. Just enjoy helping out. You might like #ubuntu-california , there's a loco team with some members in OC
2009-02-07T09:16:00.000Z	sagredo	nickrud	thanks I'll scope it
2009-02-07T09:16:00.000Z	sagredo	nickrud	how can I alias a executable file? The only way I've been able to figure out how to run it is with the guis
2009-02-07T09:17:00.000Z	nickrud	sagredo	add a line to your .bashrc , for example   alias  ac='/usr/bin/apt-cache'   When you log in, the alias will automatically be there
2009-02-07T09:17:00.000Z	sagredo	nickrud	will I be able to use it instantly?
2009-02-07T09:18:00.000Z	nickrud	sagredo	no. but, if you type   source ~/.bashrc , your shell will re-read the file and then you'll have access
2009-02-07T09:18:00.000Z	sagredo	nickrud	thanks
2009-02-07T09:22:00.000Z	sagredo	nickrud	it returned ' error while loading shared libraries: libjemalloc.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory'; is there another command to "run" a file, like a shell script or executable?
2009-02-07T09:22:00.000Z	nickrud	sagredo	I'm not sure what you did there. what command gave that error?
2009-02-07T09:31:00.000Z	sagredo	nickrud	alias songbird='/home/sagredo/Songbird/songbird-bin'
2009-02-07T09:33:00.000Z	nickrud	sagredo	but if you do    cd /home/sagredoSongbird && ./songbird-bin, it runs?
2009-02-07T09:33:00.000Z	nickrud	sagredo	with the right cd dir, of course
2009-02-07T09:46:00.000Z	sagredo	nickrud	that, however, does not work when I alias the command, any suggestions?
2009-02-07T09:48:00.000Z	sagredo	nickrud	nevermind, I was directing it to the wrong file when I wrote the alias command, it's working
