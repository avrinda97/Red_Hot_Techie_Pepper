2007-06-02T10:19:00.000Z	netham45		1 more question
2007-06-02T10:19:00.000Z	netham45		how hard is it to resize an NTFS partition???
2007-06-02T10:19:00.000Z	qman	netham45	that depends on who you ask, how fragmented your partition is, and how full it is
2007-06-02T10:20:00.000Z	qman	netham45	I've generally been very successful doing it, just make sure you defrag and that you have at least 5GB of free space
2007-06-02T10:23:00.000Z	qman	netham45	boot windows, and let it run chkdsk, then defrag, then shut down properly
2007-06-02T10:23:00.000Z	netham45	qman	I am running a defrag
2007-06-02T10:24:00.000Z	qman	netham45	if the system is unable to defrag itself, you're probably going to have trouble
2007-06-02T10:24:00.000Z	qman	netham45	you may want to try booting a windows PE CD or NTFS DOS, and defrag from there
2007-06-02T10:24:00.000Z	netham45	qman	I am booted into my install of XP
2007-06-02T10:25:00.000Z	qman	netham45	yes, but the system may have a lot of fragmented files it can't access while it's running. A windows PE CD or NTFS DOS would have a better chance at it, since none of the files on the drive would be open
2007-06-02T10:26:00.000Z	netham45	qman	the files that are fragmented are some DVD's I copied to my HD.
2007-06-02T10:26:00.000Z	qman	netham45	I also suggest running chkdsk if you're unable to defrag, you may have some errors
2007-06-02T10:27:00.000Z	qman	netham45	then perhaps it's just a software error, maybe rebooting will fix it?
2007-06-02T10:27:00.000Z	netham45	qman	it is going fine, I was wondering what would happen if it failed. sorry.
2007-06-02T10:29:00.000Z	qman	netham45	yes, all you have to do is configure the xorg.conf file
2007-06-02T10:29:00.000Z	qman	netham45	systems have been set up such that there were 6 independent heads to one machine, 6 monitors, 6 keyboards, 6 mice, 6 X sessions
