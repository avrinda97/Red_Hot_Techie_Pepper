2007-11-20T01:43:00.000Z	Em3raldMcSquizzy		shaka if you open a terminal and type:  fdisk -l  .... it should give you a list of your drives, and you can determine which should have your WIndows installation.  Knowing which drive will allow us to manually add a Windows entry in your GRUB file.

2007-11-20T01:45:00.000Z	Em3raldMcSquizzy	shaka1	typically we try to avoid that because others need to learn.  Unfortunately, I have to go to the bank for a meeting in 15 minutes.  However, there are tutorials on the 'net that are easy to follow.  Try googling something like GRUB manual windows help ... sorry I couldn't stay ...
