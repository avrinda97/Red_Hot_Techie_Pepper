2012-03-21T20:51:00.000Z	office_it_guy201		Hello Ubuntu support channel! Can someone help me out with a possibly-simple problem?
2012-03-21T20:52:00.000Z	office_it_guy201		I have a bunch of Thinkpad T420s machines, running the newest version of Ubuntu, and I can't figure out how to make external monitors work via the DisplayPort. Do I need a special driver?
2012-03-21T20:54:00.000Z	Praxi	office_it_guy201	did you try the blue fn keys?
2012-03-21T20:57:00.000Z	Praxi	office_it_guy201	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fn_key  look at the picture, blue FN key then on mine it was F4
2012-03-21T20:57:00.000Z	Praxi	office_it_guy201	on my stinkpad, that toggled the external display, would go from no external, to external only, to both type thing
2012-03-21T20:58:00.000Z	office_it_guy201	Praxi	was the monitor recognized in system settings even when the external wasn't toggled on?
2012-03-21T21:32:00.000Z	office_it_guy201	Praxi	I just tried the external monitor Fn+F7 trick you taught me on a different Thinkpad T420s and it doesn't work
2012-03-21T21:37:00.000Z	office_it_guy201	Praxi	booting with the lid closed doesn't make a difference, still doesn't work.
2012-03-21T21:41:00.000Z	Praxi	office_it_guy201	so you got no video with the lid closed then?
2012-03-21T21:42:00.000Z	Praxi	office_it_guy201	do you know what video chipset is in it? ATI or Nvidia?
2012-03-21T21:44:00.000Z	Praxi	office_it_guy201	should be a nvidia x server settings, under that, see if both your monitors show up.  If they don't hit that FN F7 until they do.  Once they do, enable twin view on the new monitor that showed up.
2012-03-21T21:46:00.000Z	office_it_guy201	Praxi	can I ask you to be a little more explicit? I'm not sure where the "nvidia x server settings" are or how to get to them
2012-03-21T21:56:00.000Z	Praxi	office_it_guy201	Turn off optimus in the bios?  http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1748475
2012-03-21T21:59:00.000Z	Praxi	office_it_guy201	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/NvidiaMultiMonitors  <--Mine looks similar to that hehe
2012-03-21T23:34:00.000Z	office_it_guy201	Praxi	did you hear my update on the monitor thing? I'd like your opinion on what's going on
2012-03-21T23:37:00.000Z	Praxi	office_it_guy201	do ALL of the i5's work?
2012-03-21T23:39:00.000Z	Praxi	office_it_guy201	but the drive DIDNT work until you erased it? or did you try it before erasing?
2012-03-21T23:42:00.000Z	Praxi	office_it_guy201	http://support.lenovo.com/en_US/research/hints-or-tips/detail.page?LegacyDocID=MIGR-77167  check that page for bios updates, looks like the latest is 1.37, see what your i7's are running bios wise
2012-03-21T23:43:00.000Z	office_it_guy201	Praxi	I'm going to install 11.10 on a drive in the i7, then move it to the i5 and see what happens
2012-03-22T00:15:00.000Z	office_it_guy201	Praxi	I just installed 11.10 on the i7, then switched the SSD to the i5
2012-03-22T00:36:00.000Z	office_it_guy201	Praxi	I just downloaded the BIOS upgrade disc, attempted to run it on an i7, and it said no update is necessary.
2012-03-22T00:44:00.000Z	Praxi	office_it_guy201	did you take the i7 hard drive and plop it in the i5 and it worked?
2012-03-22T00:50:00.000Z	Praxi	office_it_guy201	try ubuntu 10.10?  lots of other tasty bits in this thread http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1728526&page=3
2012-03-22T00:53:00.000Z	office_it_guy201	Praxi	I'll try that. Although I need some features in 11.10, it'd be nice to see this work.
