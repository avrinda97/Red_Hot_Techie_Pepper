2006-11-12T06:50:00.000Z	ubuntu__		hi everyone ... here's my problem ... i made a mistake by raising my monitor resolution to 1280x1024 ... but my monitor says that the refresh rate is too high .. so i cannot see anything on the screen ... i cannot see the login box ... i know i have to edit the resolution manually by modifying /etc/X11/xorg.conf ... but i cannot get to it (on my ext3 partition) even with the LIVE Kubuntu CD.. help!
2006-11-12T06:51:00.000Z	variant	ubuntu__	ctrl alt f1 will switch yo to a virutal terminal that should allow you to log in via console
2006-11-12T06:51:00.000Z	variant	ubuntu__	just reboot to the installed system
2006-11-12T06:51:00.000Z	variant	ubuntu__	once the system has booted then type ctrl alt f1
2006-11-12T06:53:00.000Z	variant	ubuntu__	you DO NOT HAVE TO DO THAT
2006-11-12T06:53:00.000Z	ubuntu__	variant	mkdir: cannot create directory `mnt/F': No such file or directory
2006-11-12T06:53:00.000Z	variant	ubuntu__	reboot to the installed system, take the live cd out
2006-11-12T06:55:00.000Z	ubuntu__	variant	so when my monitor goes blank at login .. ctrl+alt+F1 .. then edit xorg.conf .. right? change the first resolution to something like "1024x768" right?
2006-11-12T06:55:00.000Z	variant	ubuntu__	exactly
2006-11-12T06:56:00.000Z	ubuntu__	variant	cool ty
2006-11-12T06:58:00.000Z	variant	ubuntu__	i told you to reboot and not use the live cd
2006-11-12T06:59:00.000Z	variant	ubuntu__	ok, i wont bother helping you seeing as you are to ignorant to listen
2006-11-12T06:59:00.000Z	variant	ubuntu__	stop spamming
2006-11-12T07:00:00.000Z	ubuntu__	variant	sorry .. but i only want to learn
2006-11-12T07:00:00.000Z	variant	ubuntu__	of course
2006-11-12T07:01:00.000Z	variant	ubuntu__	if you really must run that installer which may break your system then do sh ./path/to/installer.bin
2006-11-12T07:02:00.000Z	ubuntu__	variant	i am about to restart and do as u told me to ... but i just need to know whether mount command works in a Live environment.. thts all .. i know my monitor problem was solved by u
2006-11-12T07:02:00.000Z	variant	ubuntu__	yes it does, you just need to create the directory that you intend to mount somthing on first
2006-11-12T07:02:00.000Z	variant	ubuntu__	mount whatever /mnt/A doesnt work because /mnt/A doesnt exist
2006-11-12T07:03:00.000Z	variant	ubuntu__	you need root access to mkdir in /mnt
2006-11-12T07:03:00.000Z	variant	ubuntu__	so sudo mkdir /mnt/A
2006-11-12T07:04:00.000Z	ubuntu__	variant	btw i am not a spammer .. but i understood wht u must feel
2006-11-12T07:05:00.000Z	variant	ubuntu__	np
2007-04-23T14:17:00.000Z	variant	ubuntu__	ubotu is a bot, don't torment it :)
