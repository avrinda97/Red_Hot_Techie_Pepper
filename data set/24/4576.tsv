2007-06-19T10:08:00.000Z	endlessguitar		can some1 help me?
2007-06-19T10:09:00.000Z	predaeus_	endlessguitar	just ask
2007-06-19T10:11:00.000Z	predaeus_	endlessguitar	probably you just need to run the binary. is there a bin directory inside?
2007-06-19T10:11:00.000Z	predaeus_	endlessguitar	or some .sh file?
2007-06-19T10:12:00.000Z	predaeus_	endlessguitar	? so it unpacked to a singel file?
2007-06-19T10:13:00.000Z	predaeus_	endlessguitar	then try ./fretsonfire.bin  in a console inside that directory
2007-06-19T10:15:00.000Z	predaeus_	endlessguitar	yes, or double click that file
2007-06-19T10:15:00.000Z	predaeus_	endlessguitar	what happened?
2007-06-19T10:16:00.000Z	predaeus_	endlessguitar	then try inside a terminal to get the error messages if there are any
2007-06-19T10:17:00.000Z	predaeus_	endlessguitar	can you post a "ls -l" of the directory to the pastebin
2007-06-19T10:18:00.000Z	predaeus_	endlessguitar	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org
2007-06-19T10:18:00.000Z	predaeus_	endlessguitar	use the above link and post the llink to your post here
2007-06-19T10:19:00.000Z	predaeus_	endlessguitar	do "cd /home/daniel/Desktop/FretsOnFire/"  then "ls -l" and post the output to the pastebin again please
2007-06-19T10:20:00.000Z	predaeus_	endlessguitar	run "man ls" to read up on whwat it is
2007-06-19T10:21:00.000Z	predaeus_	endlessguitar	quit man with "q"
2007-06-19T10:22:00.000Z	predaeus_	endlessguitar	then the directory is not called FretsOnFire but somethign different
2007-06-19T10:22:00.000Z	predaeus_	endlessguitar	mind that linux is case sensitive in that matter
2007-06-19T10:23:00.000Z	predaeus_	endlessguitar	do it yourself so you learn how to do it. do "cd ~/Desktop" then do "ls -l" then post the ouput to the pastebin please
2007-06-19T10:23:00.000Z	predaeus_	endlessguitar	so we can find out what that directory is called, that you unpacked to
2007-06-19T10:24:00.000Z	predaeus_	endlessguitar	the "~" is a shortcut for your home directory so "/home/daniel" is the same as "~" if you are logged in as daniel
2007-06-19T10:29:00.000Z	predaeus_	endlessguitar	by default gnome's Desktop directory is written like "Desktop"
2007-06-19T10:29:00.000Z	predaeus_	endlessguitar	the "." at the beginnning of your line is the current directory, you need to be in the correct directory to make this work.
2007-06-19T10:30:00.000Z	predaeus_	endlessguitar	right click in the file browser and check if you have executable rights on Fret...Guitar.bin. if not enable them and try to double click again.
