2010-05-01T22:23:00.000Z	abadabad00		I am having trouble installing PDFMod (version 0.8.1) in Ubuntu 10.04 (64bit). I'm trying to do it via getdeb.net, but I am being told "Could not find package 'pdfmod'."

2010-05-01T22:28:00.000Z	greezmunkey	abadabad00	you can get pdfmod here: http://linux.softpedia.com/progDownload/PDF-Mod-Download-49673.html
2010-05-01T22:32:00.000Z	abadabad00	greezmunkey	- compiling that program is nearly impossible. Every time it tells me I am missing something I install it and then it has 900 other things it says I am missing. I've gotten to a point where I can't find what it wants me to have installed. Plus, why is getdeb doing this? I assumed the whole point of getdeb was to make installation easier, not to spit errors saying it doesn't have the file
2010-05-01T22:36:00.000Z	greezmunkey	abadabad00	I can't answer that, you could look at http://www.apt-get.org - search to see if the pdfmon package exists there.
2010-05-01T22:40:00.000Z	greezmunkey	abadabad00	searching getdeb.net for pdfmon, PDFmon returns nothing - probably why you can't get it there!
2010-05-01T22:40:00.000Z	abadabad00	greezmunkey	- http://www.getdeb.net/software/PDF%20Mod
2010-05-01T22:41:00.000Z	abadabad00	greezmunkey	- PDFMOD not 'pdfmon'
2010-05-01T22:41:00.000Z	greezmunkey	abadabad00	yikes, their own search fails! Why would you trust their packages!
2010-05-01T22:41:00.000Z	greezmunkey	abadabad00	ok - I take that back...
2010-05-01T22:44:00.000Z	abadabad00	greezmunkey	- i don't see it on that unofficial apt-get.org site
2010-05-01T22:46:00.000Z	abadabad00	greezmunkey	- any ideas? where can one get the deb file?
2010-05-01T22:47:00.000Z	greezmunkey	abadabad00	did you install their "getdeb" package?
2010-05-01T22:47:00.000Z	abadabad00	greezmunkey	- yes
2010-05-01T22:47:00.000Z	abadabad00	greezmunkey	- but i will do it again
2010-05-01T22:48:00.000Z	abadabad00	greezmunkey	- since i upgraded from 9.10 to 10.04..... who knows... all this stuff is so buggy anyways
2010-05-01T22:48:00.000Z	greezmunkey	abadabad00	yeah, I was able to retrieve/install the package...
2010-05-01T22:54:00.000Z	greezmunkey	abadabad00	pretty cool program, pdfmod that is...
2010-05-01T22:55:00.000Z	abadabad00	greezmunkey	- definitely... i think i got my situation figured out
2010-05-01T22:57:00.000Z	greezmunkey	abadabad00	what did you find?
2010-05-01T22:59:00.000Z	abadabad00	greezmunkey	- i had to add the new repository, reinstall the installation deb from the getdeb website and then it worked...
2010-05-01T23:04:00.000Z	greezmunkey	abadabad00	nice, glad to see you sorted it out :)
2010-05-01T23:04:00.000Z	abadabad00	greezmunkey	- definitely... thanks for the guidance!
