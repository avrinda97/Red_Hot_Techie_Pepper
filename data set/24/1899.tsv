2011-07-08T16:34:00.000Z	ikonia	dyd	it means it will copy the disk block by block, data or no data
2011-07-08T16:35:00.000Z	dyd	ikonia	a good backup that won't make my backups all of 160 gb? :)
2011-07-08T16:35:00.000Z	ikonia	dyd	what ?
2011-07-15T13:03:00.000Z	ikonia	dyd	are you using ubuntu ?

2011-07-15T13:05:00.000Z	dyd	ikonia	yes
2011-07-15T13:05:00.000Z	ikonia	dyd	why are you looking at cpannel forums then ? as cpannel is not built for ubuntu
2011-07-15T13:06:00.000Z	dyd	ikonia	i was on google looking for a solution on that loop0 thing
2012-02-06T20:13:00.000Z	ikonia	dyd	this may sound a silly question, but why do you want to ?
2012-02-06T20:14:00.000Z	dyd	ikonia	quake live has low fps on certain maps (i've already set everything to minimum) but on windows i had always 125fps
2012-02-06T20:14:00.000Z	dyd	ikonia	i don't know why this should happen
2012-02-06T20:14:00.000Z	ikonia	dyd	windows is not ubuntu
2012-02-06T20:14:00.000Z	dyd	ikonia	thanks for the hint
2012-02-06T20:16:00.000Z	ikonia	dyd	you can't expect things to function the same, especially without open drivers like ati
2012-02-06T20:16:00.000Z	dyd	ikonia	i just wondered if it could be a driver issue
2012-03-14T19:12:00.000Z	ikonia	dyd	you can't, you can only kill it
2012-03-14T19:12:00.000Z	ikonia	dyd	kill -11 $PID
2012-03-14T19:13:00.000Z	dyd	ikonia	thanks
