2007-06-27T11:43:00.000Z	Pici	HorizonXP	Wubi is not an Official way of installing Ubuntu, you can request support in: http://ubuntuforums.org/forumdisplay.php?f=234
2007-06-27T11:44:00.000Z	HorizonXP	Pici	I'm not using Wubi....
2007-06-27T11:44:00.000Z	Pici	HorizonXP	I'm sorry, got confused.
2008-11-08T01:37:00.000Z	Pici	HorizonXP	You need to modify your /etc/mpd.conf file to point at the directory where your music resides.
2008-11-08T01:37:00.000Z	HorizonXP	Pici	i did that in ~/.mpdconf
2008-11-08T01:37:00.000Z	Pici	HorizonXP	/var/log/mpd/mpd.log will tell you if there any errors when sonata connects to mpd and cannot find the music.
2008-11-08T01:37:00.000Z	HorizonXP	Pici	is it necessary to change it in the root config too?
2008-11-08T01:38:00.000Z	Pici	HorizonXP	No, that should be enough.
2008-11-08T01:38:00.000Z	Pici	HorizonXP	Make sure that the user that is running the mpd service has rights to the directory that you are storing your music in.
2008-11-08T01:39:00.000Z	HorizonXP	Pici	in my ~/.mpd folder, there's an mpd.db file that has all of the data for my music populated in it
2008-11-08T01:39:00.000Z	Pici	HorizonXP	Did you check that log file for errors?
2008-11-08T01:40:00.000Z	HorizonXP	Pici	all it says is Avahi: Service 'Music Player' successfully establish
2008-11-08T01:41:00.000Z	HorizonXP	Pici	everytime i do /etc/init.d/mpd restart, it prints that in the log file
2008-11-08T01:43:00.000Z	HorizonXP	Pici	no ideas eh?
2008-11-08T01:56:00.000Z	HorizonXP	Pici	I had to modify it in /etc/mpd.conf. No idea why that's required, but it works
2008-11-08T01:56:00.000Z	Pici	HorizonXP	Weird, the manpage said it would look in your home first.
2008-11-08T01:57:00.000Z	HorizonXP	Pici	yeah, i'd prefer to set it up that way
