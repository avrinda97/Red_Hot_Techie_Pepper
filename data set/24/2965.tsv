2008-06-09T01:30:00.000Z	Bhavesh		i have uninvited kernel panic on my machine :(
2008-06-09T01:30:00.000Z	ikonia	Bhavesh	at what point
2008-06-09T01:31:00.000Z	Bhavesh	ikonia	at boot time
2008-06-09T01:31:00.000Z	ikonia	Bhavesh	what is the exact error before the message
2008-06-09T01:32:00.000Z	Bhavesh	ikonia	the whole story: i have promis IDE fasttrack lite, i setup two drives with mirroring, and when i reboot, it either hangs at the controller, or it passes that and hangs at kernel panic
2008-06-09T01:32:00.000Z	ikonia	Bhavesh	ahhh fake raid mirroring - I don't advise it
2008-06-09T01:33:00.000Z	ikonia	Bhavesh	the support for fake raid is very poor in general
2008-06-09T01:33:00.000Z	Bhavesh	ikonia	but when i reboot without the drive it works fine..
2008-06-09T01:33:00.000Z	Bhavesh	ikonia	so better to leave that alone and use software raid .. much better?
2008-06-09T01:33:00.000Z	ikonia	Bhavesh	MUCH better than fake raid
2008-06-09T01:34:00.000Z	Bhavesh	ikonia	thank you.. would same thing go for any of the controllers i have another machine  with SIL680 ctlr ?
2008-06-09T01:34:00.000Z	ikonia	Bhavesh	any controller that is fake raid, is an exceptionally poor choice in my view
2008-06-09T01:35:00.000Z	Bhavesh	ikonia	in that case i will let that go and learn how to setup software raid
2008-06-09T01:35:00.000Z	ikonia	Bhavesh	that (in my view) will serve you better
2008-06-09T01:35:00.000Z	Bhavesh	ikonia	i guess the only good once are hardware based where the controllere costs A LOT of money
2008-06-09T01:36:00.000Z	ikonia	Bhavesh	cost a lot of money = good for a reason
2008-06-09T01:36:00.000Z	Bhavesh	ikonia	point well taken
2008-06-09T01:41:00.000Z	Bhavesh	ikonia	raid disabled on cheap chard let's see how it goes
2008-06-09T01:41:00.000Z	ikonia	Bhavesh	you'll find it easier
2008-06-09T01:41:00.000Z	ikonia	Bhavesh	it will do, you'll need to re-install
2008-06-09T01:42:00.000Z	ikonia	Bhavesh	or reconfigure the install to use single disk layout
2008-06-09T01:42:00.000Z	Bhavesh	ikonia	no big deal.. the actual OS is installed on a non-raid drive
2008-06-09T01:43:00.000Z	Bhavesh	ikonia	even if i don't have RAID, the kernle panics.. attempted to kill the idle task!
2012-02-26T16:54:00.000Z	ikonia	Bhavesh	up to you, I don't think wubi as a technology is a sound process, but some people like it
