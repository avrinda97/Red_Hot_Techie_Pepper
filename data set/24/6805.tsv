2005-07-10T15:32:00.000Z	harold		How do I exit irssi?
2005-07-10T15:33:00.000Z	harold		That easy, huh?
2005-07-10T15:34:00.000Z	harold		Thanks, zukalk.
2005-07-10T15:34:00.000Z	harold		So, I've managed to install Ubuntu...
2005-07-10T15:35:00.000Z	harold		...I moved the kernel and initrd.img using sftp yesterday.
2005-07-10T15:35:00.000Z	harold		noliath: thanks!
2005-07-10T15:35:00.000Z	harold		noliath: No, I'm not
2005-07-10T15:35:00.000Z	harold		noliath: Why do you say that?
2005-07-10T15:35:00.000Z	harold		Yes
2005-07-10T15:36:00.000Z	harold		noliath: When I attempto to boot Ubuntu, it reports that it's unable to load X
2005-07-10T15:36:00.000Z	Seveas	harold	have you installed Breezy?
2005-07-10T15:36:00.000Z	harold	Seveas	No, Warty
2005-07-10T15:37:00.000Z	Seveas	harold	why? Hoary is more recent and X works better in it
2005-07-10T15:37:00.000Z	harold	Seveas	I understand Hoary wants 128MB RAM.
2005-07-10T15:37:00.000Z	Seveas	harold	well, if you have that little memory, warty+gnome won't work either
2005-07-10T15:38:00.000Z	Seveas	harold	it's xserver-xfree86 on warty
2005-07-10T15:38:00.000Z	harold	Seveas	What would work?
2005-07-10T15:38:00.000Z	Seveas	harold	hoary+xfce
2005-07-10T15:38:00.000Z	harold	Seveas	Thank you
2005-07-10T15:38:00.000Z	Seveas	harold	install hoary with server optioan and install xfce of fluxbox on top
2005-07-10T15:39:00.000Z	Seveas	harold	it actually is the other way around
2005-07-10T15:40:00.000Z	harold	Seveas	I do have Hoary downloaded...
2005-07-10T15:41:00.000Z	harold	Seveas	So fluxbox would be better for 64MB RAM?
2005-07-10T15:41:00.000Z	Seveas	harold	yes
