2010-09-03T12:37:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	pfifo	the exageration depends on what is a good system, and what is a decent system... i do not own a quad system (yet) and even then, every report /i get, the advantages are usually marginal, and for some kinds of programs only (not every time) - even with -O2 enabled
2010-09-03T12:39:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	pfifo	I think Chris was disconnected during your last comments
2010-09-03T12:40:00.000Z	pfifo	PresuntoRJ	the main advantage to compiling your own programs it to add useful features or remove useless ones, for example the ffmpeg package in universe dosen not support faad2 due to licensing terms, therefor if you want to make ipod videos you need to compile by source (however Im not sure if that is still the case in 10.04)
2010-09-03T12:40:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	pfifo	can't you get the same result installing the faad2 package?
2010-09-03T12:41:00.000Z	pfifo	PresuntoRJ	no
2010-09-03T12:41:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	pfifo	I see
2010-09-03T12:41:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	pfifo	did not know that, then again, I dont have an iPod
2010-09-03T12:41:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	pfifo	never had to try it
2010-09-03T12:41:00.000Z	pfifo	PresuntoRJ	its not a codec type of issue like most players, you need to specifically have enable support for it at compile time
2010-09-03T12:49:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	pfifo	you could get it running pretty effortlessly with $ sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop ... I think it's still true
2010-09-03T12:50:00.000Z	pfifo	PresuntoRJ	I believe thats what Chris_Psycho did but is not getting the performance that was expected
2010-09-03T12:56:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	pfifo	I really miss CDE ;)
2010-09-03T13:37:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	pfifo	is there a mono in the bot?
2010-09-03T13:37:00.000Z	pfifo	PresuntoRJ	yes, somewhere
2010-09-03T13:43:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	pfifo	maybe partner aswell
2010-09-03T13:44:00.000Z	pfifo	PresuntoRJ	i dont know if there is much in partner that is useful, i dont emable it cause ive never needed it
2010-09-03T13:47:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	pfifo	sun-java6 is only there
2010-09-03T14:07:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	pfifo	there are still few channels for ubuntu, and only separated by MAJOR subjects... ubuntu for generic questions, ubuntu-server for, you guess, server related questions, ubuntu+1 for next releases, and ubuntu-cloud
2010-09-03T14:08:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	pfifo	are there any other worth mention ?
2010-09-03T14:08:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	pfifo	and they have merged recently
2010-09-03T14:09:00.000Z	pfifo	PresuntoRJ	there is also a bunch of #ubuntu-XX where XX is a language
2010-09-03T14:10:00.000Z	pfifo	PresuntoRJ	use /list ubuntu
