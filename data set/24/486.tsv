2011-10-24T22:57:00.000Z	auronandace	darius	what are you trying to do?
2011-10-24T22:59:00.000Z	darius	auronandace	I am trying to install things from the ubuntu software store, but I can't install anything, when it lets me press the install button, it crashes right before it installs all the way, but most of the time it wont let me press install at all.
2011-10-24T22:59:00.000Z	auronandace	darius	i tend to use synaptic rather than the software centre
2011-10-24T23:00:00.000Z	darius	auronandace	yes that wouldn't ne am issue, but i can't isntall it without the software centre right?
2011-10-24T23:01:00.000Z	auronandace	darius	sudo apt-get update (that looks for updates) sudo apt-get upgrade (that applies updates) sudo apt-get install <packagename> (that installs packagename)
2011-10-24T23:07:00.000Z	auronandace	darius	you haven't pasted what happens
2011-10-24T23:08:00.000Z	darius	auronandace	I did but here is what terminal says when I did what you said. http://pastie.org/2752169
2011-10-24T23:08:00.000Z	auronandace	darius	that isn't what i told you to do
2011-10-24T23:15:00.000Z	auronandace	darius	why are you typing cy tree?
2011-10-24T23:15:00.000Z	darius	auronandace	that's the problem, I'm not typing it, that's what happens when I hit enter to excute the command.
2011-10-24T23:18:00.000Z	auronandace	darius	try what ubottu suggests
2011-10-24T23:20:00.000Z	auronandace	darius	sudo fuser -vki /var/lib/dpkg/lock;sudo dpkg --configure -a
2011-10-24T23:30:00.000Z	auronandace	darius	just out of interest, what is the output of uname -a
2011-10-25T00:37:00.000Z	auronandace	darius	what is the output of uname -a?
2011-10-25T00:38:00.000Z	darius	auronandace	do you want me to run that command in terminal?
2011-10-25T00:38:00.000Z	auronandace	darius	yes please
2011-10-25T00:40:00.000Z	auronandace	darius	i'm not sure what java is available for 11.10
2011-10-25T00:41:00.000Z	auronandace	darius	oh, good
2011-10-25T00:43:00.000Z	darius	auronandace	Do you have any ideas what else could be causing it not to be able to connect to minecraft.net when I sign in? I can go on play offline and join my server, it's horribley laggy though.
2011-10-25T00:43:00.000Z	auronandace	darius	no idea, i don't do minecraft
