2006-06-24T11:59:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	earthen	chmod 666 <filename>
2006-06-24T12:00:00.000Z	earthen	pppoe_dude	dsas ok thanks I was trying to do it with chmod +rw with noe luck
2006-06-24T12:00:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	earthen	that only does it for owner
2006-06-24T12:01:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	earthen	although you can use it to do it for all
2006-06-24T12:02:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	earthen	chmod [ugoa]  [+/-]  [rwx] 
2006-06-24T12:03:00.000Z	earthen	pppoe_dude	mmm none of them commands seems to be working
2006-06-24T12:04:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	earthen	if you want to change all the insides too, try it with the -R option
2006-06-24T12:04:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	earthen	what are you trying to do?
2006-06-24T12:04:00.000Z	earthen	pppoe_dude	curently there is nothing in the folder
2006-06-24T12:05:00.000Z	earthen	pppoe_dude	I'm trying to creat a folder on my web server where i can store images
2006-06-24T12:05:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	earthen	is it giving you persmission denied?
2006-06-24T12:05:00.000Z	earthen	pppoe_dude	nope
2006-06-24T12:05:00.000Z	earthen	pppoe_dude	no errors at all
2006-06-24T12:06:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	earthen	try adding an x in there... chmod 777 <folder>
2006-06-24T12:06:00.000Z	earthen	pppoe_dude	but I can't seem to upload file to it via ftp, I assumeing it's because the folder is only rw for root
2006-06-24T12:06:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	earthen	or you can also try chown...
2006-06-24T12:07:00.000Z	earthen	pppoe_dude	777 seems to have don it
2006-06-24T12:07:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	earthen	my prof once taught me to use 777 for folders (as they need to be "executable" in order to get in
2006-06-24T12:08:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	earthen	i dont know how accurate that is
2006-06-24T12:08:00.000Z	earthen	pppoe_dude	mmm I don't know eather
2006-06-24T12:08:00.000Z	earthen	pppoe_dude	i'm only storing pic's there that will show up on a web page
2006-06-24T12:09:00.000Z	earthen	pppoe_dude	it working now my file are transfering
2006-06-24T12:09:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	earthen	ya i think the 'cd' command actually requires the directory to be executable
