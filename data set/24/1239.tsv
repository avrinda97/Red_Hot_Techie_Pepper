2010-05-09T15:13:00.000Z	wesguin	babai	did you try unmounting it first?
2010-05-09T15:13:00.000Z	babai	wesguin	ya, i never mounted it in the first place
2010-05-09T15:13:00.000Z	wesguin	babai	what are you  using for the partition utility?
2010-05-09T15:14:00.000Z	babai	wesguin	first i tried with the ubuntu installer , then gparted in the livecd mode, both are complaining the same issue
2010-05-09T15:16:00.000Z	wesguin	babai	hmm. I never ran into that problem
2010-05-09T15:16:00.000Z	babai	wesguin	i'm trying to install it as /dev/sda1 as root and /dev/sda3 as home
2010-05-09T15:16:00.000Z	babai	wesguin	other distros seem to have no probs with it
2010-05-09T15:16:00.000Z	wesguin	babai	yeah nothing wrong so far
2010-05-09T15:17:00.000Z	babai	wesguin	i'm going to try the oem install mode, see if that works
2010-05-09T15:18:00.000Z	wesguin	babai	good luck... I just spent 7 hrs fighting my sisters computer putting ubuntu desktop version on it
2010-05-09T15:18:00.000Z	babai	wesguin	lol, i didnt have this issue with karmic
2010-05-09T15:18:00.000Z	wesguin	babai	yeah me neither
2010-05-09T15:18:00.000Z	wesguin	babai	that's what I was upgrading her from
2010-05-09T15:19:00.000Z	babai	wesguin	is the livecd using it as a cache storage partition?
2010-05-09T15:19:00.000Z	babai	wesguin	like a squasfs
2010-05-09T15:19:00.000Z	wesguin	babai	no it's not
2010-05-09T15:20:00.000Z	wesguin	babai	it's using squashfs but that is on the cd
2010-05-09T15:20:00.000Z	babai	wesguin	gparted on the lucid cd is not even letting me create an extended partion on it, only primary partitions
2010-05-09T15:21:00.000Z	babai		evanthia: u use static ip?
2010-05-09T15:21:00.000Z	wesguin	babai	well normally I just use primary first and extended if it wants to do it that way
