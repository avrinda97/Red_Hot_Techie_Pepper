2009-07-25T09:01:00.000Z	Cyrano_De	jamescarr	Your lucky you can close the window your working in.
2009-07-25T09:01:00.000Z	jamescarr	Cyrano_De	what causes this!?
2009-07-25T09:01:00.000Z	Cyrano_De	jamescarr	9.04 will completly lock up on me pretty regularly.
2009-07-25T09:01:00.000Z	jamescarr	Cyrano_De	really?
2009-07-25T09:02:00.000Z	Cyrano_De	jamescarr	I wish I knew.  A lot of people have been thinking it was video drivers.  If you look on luanchpad you will see several bug reports
2009-07-25T09:02:00.000Z	Cyrano_De	jamescarr	It does not seem to matter if you are running an ATI card, Nvidia card or Intel card.
2009-07-25T09:03:00.000Z	Cyrano_De	jamescarr	If you have another system you can ssh in and safely reboot.
2009-07-25T09:03:00.000Z	jamescarr	Cyrano_De	it seems ctrl+alt+backspace doesnt go to gdm
2009-07-25T09:03:00.000Z	jamescarr	Cyrano_De	nah, I can reboot just fine
2009-07-25T09:03:00.000Z	Cyrano_De	jamescarr	for most, myself included the magic sysreq setquence doesn't even help.
2009-07-25T09:04:00.000Z	Cyrano_De	jamescarr	ctrl+alt+backspace has been disabled in 9.04.  You can turn it back on.  There is a utility that will do so for you.
2009-07-25T09:04:00.000Z	jamescarr	Cyrano_De	ah
2009-07-25T09:06:00.000Z	Cyrano_De	jamescarr	sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart
2009-09-23T10:05:00.000Z	Cyrano_De	jamescarr	I just sent some questions in #LinuxHelp
