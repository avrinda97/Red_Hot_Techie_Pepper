2006-10-15T15:20:00.000Z	jrib	wildchild	you are missing some repositories.  Can you pastebin your sources.list
2006-10-15T15:21:00.000Z	wildchild	jrib	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/26915/
2006-10-15T15:21:00.000Z	jrib	wildchild	you have the main repository commented (as well as others)
2006-10-15T15:22:00.000Z	jrib	wildchild	are you comfortable editing that file yourself, or want some help?
2006-10-15T15:22:00.000Z	wildchild	jrib	don't know which are main
2006-10-15T15:23:00.000Z	jrib	wildchild	lines 2 and 4 have the main and restricted repos.  lines 9 and 11 have the dapper-updates, 34 and 37 give you security updates
2006-10-15T15:24:00.000Z	jrib	wildchild	to edit the file, just opena a terminal and run 'gksudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list'.  Then remove the initial # sign in front of those lines.  Save the file.  The run 'sudo apt-get update'
2006-10-15T15:26:00.000Z	wildchild	jrib	tnx (I use kubuntu: sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list)
2006-10-15T15:26:00.000Z	jrib	wildchild	oh right
2006-10-15T15:26:00.000Z	wildchild	jrib	can I do sudo apt-get upgrade
2006-10-15T15:26:00.000Z	jrib	wildchild	sudo apt-get update
2006-10-15T15:27:00.000Z	jrib	wildchild	upgrade will upgrade your packages, update will refresh the package list
2006-10-15T15:28:00.000Z	wildchild	jrib	what about sudo apt-get dist-upgrade (since I have unstable version)
2006-10-15T15:28:00.000Z	jrib	wildchild	if you are running edgy, then you should dist-upgrade until the stable release.  dist-upgrade can basically remove packages while upgrade can't.  'man apt-get' has a good description of the difference
2006-10-15T15:29:00.000Z	wildchild	jrib	tnx again
2006-10-15T15:29:00.000Z	jrib	wildchild	np
2006-10-25T06:02:00.000Z	jrib	wildchild	how are you installing?
2006-12-11T10:14:00.000Z	jrib	wildchild	it is installed
2006-12-11T10:17:00.000Z	jrib	wildchild	why were you looking for python?  What do you want to do?
2006-12-11T10:19:00.000Z	wildchild	jrib	I thought version ov python was the reason for error code, when I tryed to run "Amarok Shouter" - internet radion so ppls could lusten my radio but looks like version of python isn't the issue (it's allready instaled the newest one)
2006-12-11T10:19:00.000Z	jrib	wildchild	oh ok
2006-12-11T10:19:00.000Z	wildchild	jrib	do u use shouter :)
