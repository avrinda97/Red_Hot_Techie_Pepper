2005-12-13T15:03:00.000Z	blue-frog	Technobabble	what do u mean by how services are handled?
2005-12-13T15:05:00.000Z	blue-frog	Technobabble	that's a redhat thing indeed, services are under /etc/init.d, u also have system > administration > services, and applications > system tools > system monitor
2005-12-13T15:06:00.000Z	Technobabble	blue-frog	tyvm
2005-12-13T15:07:00.000Z	blue-frog	Technobabble	does any other apps launch when u click on them? (such as synaptic..)
2005-12-13T15:07:00.000Z	blue-frog	Technobabble	the password asked is your password
2005-12-13T15:16:00.000Z	blue-frog	Technobabble	like ps x or it anything eles you look for?
2005-12-13T15:19:00.000Z	blue-frog	Technobabble	it takes not long to get used to it, coming from fedora took me not long to get accustomed. ubuntu sticks more to what u find in linux manuals the redhat so inb the end it becomes easier
2005-12-13T15:19:00.000Z	Technobabble	blue-frog	i'm glad, i'll definately stick to this for a while
