2005-05-19T12:46:00.000Z	aardvark		apt-get dist-upgrade anyone ????????????????????????
2005-05-19T12:46:00.000Z	tritium	aardvark	is it "upgrade" or "dist-upgrade" that is holding packages back?
2005-05-19T12:47:00.000Z	aardvark	tritium	dist-upgrade
2005-05-19T12:47:00.000Z	tritium	aardvark	which packages?
2005-05-19T12:48:00.000Z	tritium	aardvark	please query me and paste the output
2005-05-19T12:48:00.000Z	aardvark	tritium	the box in question is at home and I am at work....using my Powerbook
2005-05-19T12:49:00.000Z	tritium	aardvark	okay.  I'm somewhat surprised, frankly.  upgrade might hold the packages back, but I would expect dist-upgrade not to.
2005-05-19T12:49:00.000Z	aardvark	tritium	is there anyway to get more verbose info on which dependancies are holding me back
2005-05-19T12:50:00.000Z	tritium	aardvark	you can use the "-u" switch
2005-05-19T12:50:00.000Z	aardvark	tritium	my warty box here dist-upgraded to hoary just fine
2005-05-19T12:50:00.000Z	aardvark	tritium	ok I'll try it tonite thanx
2005-05-19T12:51:00.000Z	tritium	aardvark	you can also use the -s switch.  (-u = --show-upgrade, -s = --simulate)
2005-05-19T12:51:00.000Z	tritium	aardvark	-u = --show-upgraded, that is ;)
2005-05-19T12:51:00.000Z	aardvark	tritium	cool i should have RTFM'd
2005-05-19T13:15:00.000Z	aardvark	tritium	are you an official Ubuntu dev ?
2005-05-19T13:16:00.000Z	tritium	aardvark	no, I'm an motu
2005-05-19T13:16:00.000Z	aardvark	tritium	excuse my French, what the $^#@$%@# is motu
2005-05-19T13:17:00.000Z	tritium	aardvark	heh, sorry.  We maintain packages in universe, but not main
2005-05-19T13:21:00.000Z	tritium	aardvark	why do you ask?  just curious, or did you have a concern?
2005-05-19T13:21:00.000Z	aardvark	tritium	just interested
2005-05-19T13:21:00.000Z	tritium	aardvark	okay :)
