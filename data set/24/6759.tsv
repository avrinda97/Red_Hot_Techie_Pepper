2005-07-27T15:53:00.000Z	LuNaTiK^GuY		Linux is not ALL easy...but its improving....but we shouldnt expect it to be a Windows copy...although IMHO it should follow some guidelines
2005-07-27T15:55:00.000Z	LuNaTiK^GuY		if its a theme on top of gnome/kde it will run just as fine i guess
2005-07-27T15:55:00.000Z	LuNaTiK^GuY		is the linux community fearing Longhorn a little bit?
2005-07-27T15:55:00.000Z	LuNaTiK^GuY		its like gonna be the BIG BANG from M$

2005-07-27T15:56:00.000Z	LuNaTiK^GuY		wot if by some remote chance...longhorn comes out to be this super-sable bomb as promised
2005-07-27T15:57:00.000Z	LuNaTiK^GuY		XP is already "Ok"
2005-07-27T15:57:00.000Z	qt2	LuNaTiK^GuY	maybe the envisioned version of vista held some weight, but what it's become is nothing special.
2005-07-29T08:13:00.000Z	qt2	LuNaTiK^GuY	grab qt3 from synaptic?
2005-07-29T08:14:00.000Z	qt2	LuNaTiK^GuY	libqt3 something, just ctrl+f libqt3
2005-07-29T08:14:00.000Z	qt2	LuNaTiK^GuY	you'll probably need -dev and -headers. ;)
2005-07-29T08:15:00.000Z	qt2	LuNaTiK^GuY	and libqt3c102-mt. ;)
2005-07-29T08:17:00.000Z	qt2	LuNaTiK^GuY	;)
2005-07-29T08:18:00.000Z	qt2	LuNaTiK^GuY	because some people want the headers but not dev?
2005-07-29T08:19:00.000Z	LuNaTiK^GuY	qt2	hey i'm a noob :)
2005-07-29T08:19:00.000Z	qt2	LuNaTiK^GuY	so am i. ;)
2005-07-29T08:19:00.000Z	LuNaTiK^GuY	qt2	i dont even know wot the differences are!
2005-07-29T08:21:00.000Z	LuNaTiK^GuY	qt2	got the same error again :(
2005-07-29T08:23:00.000Z	qt2	LuNaTiK^GuY	then follow apokryphos's advice.
2005-07-29T08:51:00.000Z	qt2	LuNaTiK^GuY	might want to inquier in #kde...? ;)
2005-07-29T08:51:00.000Z	qt2	LuNaTiK^GuY	err, i mean #qt
