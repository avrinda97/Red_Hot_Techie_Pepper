2008-05-19T04:44:00.000Z	Darlok_Williams		How do I find a specific file in a directory/sub-dirs?
2008-05-19T04:45:00.000Z	soundray	Darlok_Williams	find /path/to/dir -name filename
2008-05-19T04:45:00.000Z	Darlok_Williams	soundray	Hmm... that's what I tried...
2008-05-19T04:46:00.000Z	Darlok_Williams	soundray	But that gives me a huge list of files that have nothing to do with what I searched for... and a lot of "Permission Denied" errors.
2008-05-19T04:46:00.000Z	soundray	Darlok_Williams	it won't work if there is a symlink in /path/to/dir
2008-05-19T04:46:00.000Z	Darlok_Williams	soundray	Okay, well how do I make it work if there ARE symlinks?  And Gnome's search for files app doesn't let you search recursively either.
2008-05-19T04:52:00.000Z	soundray	Darlok_Williams	'cd /path/to/dir ; find . -name filename 2>/dev/null'
2008-05-19T23:03:00.000Z	soundray	Darlok_Williams	you're certainly pretending successfully ;)
2008-06-01T23:43:00.000Z	soundray	Darlok_Williams	you can use gparted from the live CD to remove the Ubuntu partitions and resize the Windows partition to occupy the free space
2008-06-01T23:43:00.000Z	Darlok_Williams	soundray	That's what I did... but I'm stuck on Grub not booting windows.  DO I need to use the Windows XP disc to fix that?
2008-06-01T23:43:00.000Z	soundray	Darlok_Williams	yes
2008-06-01T23:44:00.000Z	Darlok_Williams	soundray	You happen to know the command for the recovery console?
2008-06-01T23:44:00.000Z	soundray	Darlok_Williams	if you don't have one, you can use any DOS rescue CD/floppy
2008-06-01T23:44:00.000Z	soundray	Darlok_Williams	no, but IIRC, there is a menu option for repairing the master boot record.
2008-06-01T23:45:00.000Z	soundray	Darlok_Williams	in DOS, it's fdisk /fixmbr
2008-06-01T23:45:00.000Z	Darlok_Williams	soundray	Thank you.
2008-06-01T23:47:00.000Z	Darlok_Williams	soundray	Hmm... I booted my Windows XP disc, but it didn't give me an option for Recovery Console... did I miss something?
2008-06-01T23:47:00.000Z	soundray	Darlok_Williams	don't know, sorry, now Windows expert here.
2008-06-06T22:27:00.000Z	soundray	Darlok_Williams	I've heard that some people have had success with the dmixplugin link from the sound factoid:
2008-06-06T22:28:00.000Z	Darlok_Williams	soundray	Well, my sound works usually.... but since installing Hardy, every time I use an application that plays sound, every other program that tries to play sound is muted.
2008-06-06T22:28:00.000Z	Darlok_Williams	soundray	This even after closing the original program and after restarting X.  It seems that PulseAudio captures the device and never lets go.
2008-06-06T22:29:00.000Z	Darlok_Williams	soundray	I still have no sound even after killing pulseaudio and changing the ALSA
2008-06-06T22:29:00.000Z	soundray	Darlok_Williams	sorry, beyond the dmixplugin thing I don't have any suggestions
2008-06-06T22:30:00.000Z	soundray	Darlok_Williams	my nick dates back to days when I did ultrasound imaging research
