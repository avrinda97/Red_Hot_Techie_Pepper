2005-10-22T13:46:00.000Z	volvoguy		hey all, i found an app that saved all the data off my dying drive. i'm now getting ready to send the drive back for a replacement and want to make sure it's as wiped as possible. any pointers on the best way to do that?
2005-10-22T13:48:00.000Z	dooglus	volvoguy	get a package called "wipe" - and run a program called "wipe".  it - um - wipes things :)
2005-10-22T13:48:00.000Z	volvoguy	dooglus	:-)
2005-10-22T13:49:00.000Z	volvoguy	dooglus	just a bunch of one's and zero's is probably fine. there's no real sensitive data on there.
2005-10-22T13:50:00.000Z	dooglus	volvoguy	read the 'wipe' man page.  it includes the term "rising totalitarianism"
2005-10-22T13:50:00.000Z	volvoguy	dooglus	ok.
2005-10-22T13:51:00.000Z	dooglus	volvoguy	the author of wipe clearly thinks that his hard-disks are working against him.
2005-10-22T13:52:00.000Z	volvoguy	dooglus	i've met people like that. i know one guy that takes old drives apart and melts 'em to dispose of them.
2005-10-22T13:52:00.000Z	dooglus	volvoguy	my Dad took an electric drill to his last PC's hard-disk before throwing it out!
2005-10-22T13:53:00.000Z	volvoguy	dooglus	then there's my uncle who does his bills and taxes on his computer and puts it out on the curb every time he gets a virus he can't fix. *rolls eyes*
2005-10-22T13:54:00.000Z	dooglus	volvoguy	"The best way  to sanitize a storage medium  is to subject it to  temperatures exceeding 1500K.   As a  cheap alternative, you might  use wipe at  your own risk."
2005-10-22T13:54:00.000Z	volvoguy	dooglus	i think throwing it in the pond in my backyard might take care of it too. what do i know though? :-)
2005-10-22T13:56:00.000Z	volvoguy	dooglus	i do agree with the first sentence of his description though. i threw dozens of linux and windows of programs at this drive that couldn't read a thing and finally found one that read every bit of data on the drive. quite amazing.
2005-10-22T13:56:00.000Z	dooglus	volvoguy	what eventually worked for you?
2005-10-22T13:58:00.000Z	volvoguy	dooglus	$80 was a small price to pay for 300Gb worth of data!
2005-10-22T13:59:00.000Z	dooglus	volvoguy	thanks.  you never know when such information might be handy.
2005-10-22T13:59:00.000Z	volvoguy	dooglus	this wipe guy scares me. this isn't going to secretly going to wipe data i want is it? ;-)
2005-10-22T14:00:00.000Z	dooglus	volvoguy	he sounds to me like he's just wanting to make absolutely sure you don't sue him in the unlikely event that there's a bug in his program
2005-10-22T14:00:00.000Z	volvoguy	dooglus	i highly recommend it. it worked flawlessly and they even let me keep the more expensive physical media they accidentally shipped me. good people.
2005-10-22T14:01:00.000Z	dooglus	volvoguy	it's funny that the only 'disk rescue' program you found that worked with your linux filesystems is a windows program!
2005-10-22T14:02:00.000Z	volvoguy	dooglus	ironically, most of the data recovery software i found was windows only - even if it was for rescuing linux or mac filesystems. *shrug*
2005-10-22T14:03:00.000Z	volvoguy	dooglus	have you used wipe? he suggests not wiping a whole disk (/dev/hdc), but a partition, so you don't kill an MBR. this is just a data drive though.
2005-10-22T14:15:00.000Z	volvoguy	dooglus	i know what a good test would be.... to see if the data recovery can read any data after i run wipe on this drive! :-)
2005-10-22T14:17:00.000Z	dooglus	volvoguy	I would be very surprised if it does.  just from the tone of the wipe man page I think this guy would have done a good job with 'wipe'
