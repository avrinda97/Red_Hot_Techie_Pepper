2011-04-19T06:01:00.000Z	GeekMan		so bouba how much of a gain do you think paying 34 dollars for a stick of memory will really do for me
2011-04-19T06:03:00.000Z	GeekMan		maybe i can bum some off of someone xD but in all seriousness just running gnome system monitor takes 49% of my cpu usage
2011-04-19T06:04:00.000Z	GeekMan		just running gnome system monitor takes <<29>>% of my cpu usage ( i was close)
2011-04-19T06:05:00.000Z	bouba		I cant stand windows speed anymore..i'm on vbox telling instructions for a friend how to install ubuntu via vbox...its so slow!!

2011-04-19T06:17:00.000Z	GeekMan		the question is can i make gnash run on midori
2011-04-19T06:18:00.000Z	bouba	GeekMan	no idea but midori is light and fast
2011-04-19T06:20:00.000Z	GeekMan		i have two things under the settings in midori that say flashplayer (flashplayeralternative.so)
2011-04-19T06:20:00.000Z	GeekMan		so i guess it found it then?
2011-04-19T06:22:00.000Z	bouba	GeekMan	flash works in midori yep
