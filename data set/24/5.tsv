2004-11-01T10:21:00.000Z	mdz		by default it listens only on localhost
2004-11-01T10:21:00.000Z	paulproteus	mdz	from flac-dev?
2004-11-01T10:21:00.000Z	mdz	paulproteus	the same
2004-11-01T10:22:00.000Z	paulproteus	mdz	Ah.  Then, hi. :)
2004-11-01T10:22:00.000Z	mdz	paulproteus	now you know why I haven't gotten anything done on flac lately :-)
2004-11-01T10:23:00.000Z	paulproteus	mdz	I'm thinking of teaching an Switching-to-Linux-from-Windows mini-course over three weeks, and having all the students use Ubuntu.
2004-11-01T10:25:00.000Z	mdz	paulproteus	nice!
2004-11-01T10:28:00.000Z	paulproteus	mdz	If you or Ubuntu would like to provide some ideas for the course, I'd be very very happy to discuss it.
2004-11-01T10:37:00.000Z	paulproteus	mdz	Also, someone reported earlier in the channel is ISA SB16 doesn't get detected, for what it's worth.
2004-11-01T10:37:00.000Z	mdz	paulproteus	yeah, we don't really try for ISA
2004-11-01T10:54:00.000Z	mdz	paulproteus	the installer is actually significantly modified in terms of which questions are asked and when
2004-11-09T11:19:00.000Z	paulproteus	mdz	any ideas?
2004-11-09T11:20:00.000Z	mdz	paulproteus	does it work if you use the same home directory locally?
2004-11-09T11:28:00.000Z	paulproteus	mdz	No luck.
2004-11-09T11:28:00.000Z	mdz	paulproteus	you tried using the directory locally?
2004-11-09T11:52:00.000Z	paulproteus	mdz	even after setting /home/paulproteus to be owned by paulproteus:paulproteus still gives the crazy broken GNOME.
2004-11-09T11:54:00.000Z	paulproteus	mdz	Allo?
2004-11-09T11:55:00.000Z	mdz	paulproteus	sounds like the problem has nothing to do with NFS
2004-11-09T11:56:00.000Z	paulproteus	mdz	I agree[, sadly] .
2004-11-09T12:00:00.000Z	paulproteus	mdz	I just tried lowering the MINUID and MINGID in /var/yp/Makefile.  No luck from that.
2004-11-09T12:04:00.000Z	paulproteus	mdz	if it changes anything, the UID for NIS user is about 650.  That's less than 1000, the usual Debian default minimum.
2004-11-13T13:40:00.000Z	mdz	paulproteus	you don't _have_ to upgrade all the time, neither with Debian nor Ubuntu
2004-11-13T13:40:00.000Z	paulproteus	mdz	I know.  I'm half-joking.  I like the latest software, but I realize that being crazy isn't always good.
2004-11-13T13:41:00.000Z	paulproteus	mdz	I installed Warty on two machines with 64MB of RAM.  GNOME is mostly unusable, and openoffice.org takes a full minute to load.  Are there any recommendations on either how to slim down an Ubuntu install, or on a minimum RAM size I can recommend?
