2008-03-11T07:53:00.000Z	dude_	macogw	I simply said I had a similar issue with my nvidia card, but got it fixed when I found a driver w/3d support.  Ie, the one that DIDN'T come with ubuntu :)
2008-03-11T07:53:00.000Z	macogw	dude_	oh ok
2008-03-11T07:55:00.000Z	macogw	dude_	take gdm out of the startup
2008-03-11T07:55:00.000Z	macogw	dude_	just remove the symlinks for gdm in the /etc/rc2.d/ rc3.d/ etc
2008-03-11T07:55:00.000Z	macogw	dude_	sorry
2008-03-11T07:55:00.000Z	dude_	macogw	is gdm editable with a text editor?
2008-03-11T07:56:00.000Z	macogw	dude_	dont think so
2008-03-11T07:58:00.000Z	dude_	macogw	thank you for the suggestions
2008-03-11T07:58:00.000Z	dude_	macogw	I'll take a look into those files
2008-03-11T07:58:00.000Z	macogw	dude_	that was for chafe, not you
2008-03-11T07:58:00.000Z	macogw	dude_	i got the lines messed up as the channel moved
2008-03-11T08:04:00.000Z	macogw	dude_	ubuntu-restricted-extras is the package for codecs
2008-03-11T08:05:00.000Z	macogw	dude_	medibuntu is the repo for dvd decryptors
2008-03-11T08:17:00.000Z	macogw	dude_	check the link for why we dont recommend it
2008-03-11T08:19:00.000Z	macogw	dude_	/etc/apt/sources.list is a file
2008-03-11T08:21:00.000Z	macogw	dude_	yes, automatix breaks chunks of the system in ways that would take like 5 days to repair line by line
2008-03-11T08:21:00.000Z	dude_	macogw	oh no!  That's terrible.  I shouldn't have listened to lifehacker.com :(
2008-03-11T08:23:00.000Z	macogw	dude_	yeah...i just went and corrected Wired.com's ubuntu howto to say to only use automatix if you are cool with having big chunks of broken, borked permissions, and the inability to upgrade to the new versiob
2008-03-11T08:24:00.000Z	dude_	macogw	ohh man so that's the reason why my update to 7.10 fails.  I'm still using 7.04 :(
2008-03-11T08:25:00.000Z	macogw	dude_	yeah we started saying to stay away from automatix when someone noticed the correlation between busted upgrades and use of automatix
2008-03-11T08:31:00.000Z	dude_	macogw	bazhang, here is the link to my pastebin: http://pastebin.ca/937735
2008-03-11T08:34:00.000Z	macogw	dude_	in future, use ubuntu-restricted-extras instead of automatix
2008-03-11T08:34:00.000Z	dude_	macogw	I will, thank you
