2004-10-03T16:31:00.000Z	housetier		you could encode to ogg
2004-10-03T16:32:00.000Z	housetier		you can install one by source I guess
2004-10-03T06:54:00.000Z	|trey|	housetier	should be enabled already... all he should need to do is mount -t smbfs blah blah
2004-10-03T06:55:00.000Z	|trey|	housetier	if you want to make it harder... sure  :/
2004-10-03T06:57:00.000Z	housetier	|trey|	I thought the point was to not use the command line all the time to make it less fearsome for Joe Average
2004-10-03T06:58:00.000Z	|trey|	housetier	*shrug* some things are easier via cli  :/
2004-10-03T06:58:00.000Z	housetier	|trey|	I don't think so. Its more how much one is used to cli or gui
2004-10-03T07:00:00.000Z	housetier	|trey|	you should cheer up :)
2004-10-03T07:00:00.000Z	|trey|	housetier	blah... I don't smile :/
2004-10-03T07:01:00.000Z	|trey|	housetier	I also don't help morons... I teach the right way... they can learn the "easy" way from someone else  :/
2004-10-03T07:02:00.000Z	|trey|	housetier	EXACTLY my point... the easy way SHOULDN'T take long... but it ALWAYS does...
2004-10-03T07:13:00.000Z	|trey|	housetier	umm... how you figure?
2004-10-03T07:13:00.000Z	housetier	|trey|	there are directories to be shared
2004-10-03T07:14:00.000Z	|trey|	housetier	blah... smbclient  :/
2004-10-03T05:00:00.000Z	|trey|	housetier	it was the answer though  :/
2004-10-08T14:50:00.000Z	|trey|	housetier	no... OOo just IS wrtten in java  :/
2004-10-08T14:50:00.000Z	|trey|	housetier	I didn't say java was slow... I said OOo is a mass of code, and that it is written in java...
2004-10-19T12:57:00.000Z	|trey|	housetier	thankyou  :)

2004-10-22T09:00:00.000Z	|trey|	housetier	here... copy and paste = _everyone_ ignored  :(
2004-11-12T07:07:00.000Z	|trey|	housetier	I asked for neither... I just wanted to know if others get ESD outages at all...
2004-11-16T07:57:00.000Z	|trey|	housetier	how hippiesh of you   ;)
