2008-01-22T04:55:00.000Z	bachstudies		I installed ntfs-config and now I don't seem to be able to unmount windows drives. Any advice?
2008-01-22T04:56:00.000Z	Shadow147	bachstudies	remove the ntfs-config then try to unmount
2008-01-22T04:56:00.000Z	bachstudies	Shadow147	will the drives still mount without it?
2008-01-22T04:56:00.000Z	Shadow147	bachstudies	yea
2008-01-22T04:56:00.000Z	bachstudies		thanks
2008-01-22T04:56:00.000Z	Shadow147	bachstudies	as long u have usbmount
2008-01-22T04:57:00.000Z	bachstudies	Shadow147	I'll check
2008-01-22T04:57:00.000Z	bachstudies	Shadow147	usbmount is currently not installed
2008-01-22T04:57:00.000Z	Shadow147	bachstudies	I have a External Drive thats NTFS and I didn't need the ntfs-config
2008-01-22T04:58:00.000Z	bachstudies	Shadow147	the reason i installed ntfs-config was because of some HAL-storage error
2008-01-22T04:58:00.000Z	Shadow147	bachstudies	what type of drive internal or external
2008-01-22T04:58:00.000Z	bachstudies	Shadow147	both
2008-01-22T04:58:00.000Z	Shadow147	bachstudies	hmm
2008-01-22T04:59:00.000Z	Shadow147	bachstudies	I don't no about HAL-storage errors
2008-01-22T04:59:00.000Z	bachstudies	Shadow147	like i say, ntfs-config worked its magic and the drives were instantly mounted and writable - I just want to be able to mount them manually with write access when i need them
2008-01-22T05:00:00.000Z	Shadow147	bachstudies	but ntfs drives usually automount
2008-01-22T05:00:00.000Z	Shadow147	bachstudies	I think the package you need is automount
2008-01-22T05:00:00.000Z	Shadow147		!find automount
2008-01-22T05:01:00.000Z	bachstudies	Shadow147	the error message when trying to unmount is cannot open /media/.hal-mtab
2008-01-22T05:01:00.000Z	Shadow147	bachstudies	|!find automount
2008-01-22T05:02:00.000Z	bachstudies	Shadow147	nothing
2008-01-22T05:02:00.000Z	Shadow147	bachstudies	hmm well I never have had the error
2008-01-22T05:03:00.000Z	Shadow147	bachstudies	hmm well I look around the forums u may find something there
2008-01-22T05:03:00.000Z	bachstudies	Shadow147	thanks - I have just removed the drives from fstab and will see if manually starting them works now
