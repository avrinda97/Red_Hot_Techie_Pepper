2010-06-07T03:43:00.000Z	FrozenInferno	edbian	what folder are you talking about?
2010-06-07T03:43:00.000Z	edbian	FrozenInferno	You can install a new script my adding it to the rcX.d folders in /etc.  rc1 is for runlevel 1.  rc2.d is for runlevel 2. etc etc.  To check your runlevel simply run "sudo runlevel"
2010-06-07T03:44:00.000Z	edbian	FrozenInferno	you need to give your script a special name so that it is run.  You can see the pattern from the other scripts in the folders.  S is for start and K is for kill as in startup and shutdown.  The number following is the order in which the scripts are run.
2010-06-07T03:45:00.000Z	edbian	FrozenInferno	It is "proper to put the script in /etc/init.d, mark it executable, and then create symlinks in the rcX.d folders corresponding to the run levels you'd like the scripts to start in.  I can help with all of this.  Questions?
2010-06-07T03:46:00.000Z	edbian	FrozenInferno	You, optionally, can use the update-rc.d program built into Ubuntu
2010-06-07T03:46:00.000Z	FrozenInferno	edbian	i think i can do it, but will this work for running commands? because i thought this was just for services that run continuously
2010-06-07T03:46:00.000Z	edbian	FrozenInferno	No, this is the proper way to automate anything on boot up. What does your script do?
2010-06-07T03:47:00.000Z	edbian	FrozenInferno	Any script that you want to run at start-up should be placed here.
2010-06-07T03:48:00.000Z	FrozenInferno	edbian	it copies a grub config file over /etc/default/grub and runs update-grub.
2010-06-07T03:49:00.000Z	edbian	FrozenInferno	You want that to happen everytime you boot?
2010-06-07T03:49:00.000Z	FrozenInferno	edbian	yes
2010-06-07T03:50:00.000Z	edbian	FrozenInferno	cool.  Lemme know if you have any more questions
2010-06-07T03:50:00.000Z	FrozenInferno	edbian	ok will do. thanks
2010-06-07T04:07:00.000Z	FrozenInferno	edbian	it worked, but i don't want it to run at shutdown, and it does.
2010-06-07T04:08:00.000Z	edbian	FrozenInferno	Go into rc6.d
2010-06-07T04:08:00.000Z	edbian	FrozenInferno	Do you see your script in there?
2010-06-07T04:08:00.000Z	FrozenInferno	edbian	yes
2010-06-07T04:09:00.000Z	edbian	FrozenInferno	6 is the runlevel for rebooting
2010-06-07T04:09:00.000Z	edbian	FrozenInferno	You should remove your script from that folder (all the K's and S's for it
2010-06-07T04:09:00.000Z	FrozenInferno	edbian	ok, will do
2010-06-07T04:09:00.000Z	edbian	FrozenInferno	You should also check rc0.d  and remove it from their as well
2010-06-07T04:09:00.000Z	edbian	FrozenInferno	Make sure it is in rc2.d with an S name
2010-06-07T04:10:00.000Z	FrozenInferno	edbian	ok, did all that. lemme try it out again
2010-06-07T04:10:00.000Z	edbian	FrozenInferno	k
