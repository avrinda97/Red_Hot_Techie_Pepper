2008-09-24T05:32:00.000Z	bartek		Hi there .. I am having major trouble getting my ATI card working on Hardy. I've followed a lot of guides and I think I am close. My main #1 issue is that when I try to use fglrx driver my screen doesnt just go black, it puts my Monitor into a Power Saving Mode .. anyone have any tips on where I can go from here?

2008-09-24T05:47:00.000Z	bartek	marcin	What is the correct way to set my monitors resolution in Xorg.conf .. Is it using Subsection "Display" and then "Modes" ? I want to do this right
2008-09-24T05:48:00.000Z	marcin	bartek	paste your xorg into ubuntu.pastebin.com
2008-09-24T05:48:00.000Z	bartek	marcin	one sec .. i am not quite there yet, re-installing the drivers manually using this method: http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu_Hardy_Installation_Guide#Removing_Mesa_drivers
