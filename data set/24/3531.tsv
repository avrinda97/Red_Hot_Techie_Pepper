2008-05-13T06:14:00.000Z	Starnestommy	MTecknology	taquitos: PMs from unregistered users are blocked by default
2008-05-13T06:15:00.000Z	MTecknology	Starnestommy	I allowed them once, but not for long :P
2008-05-22T09:57:00.000Z	Starnestommy	MTecknology	for controlling channel floods
2008-05-22T09:57:00.000Z	MTecknology	Starnestommy	but they're not usually in here....
2008-05-22T09:58:00.000Z	Starnestommy	MTecknology	they are, but usually only one is opped
2008-05-22T09:59:00.000Z	Starnestommy	MTecknology	they're all opped when splits keep happening so that they'll keep working if the network splits agaib
2008-05-22T09:59:00.000Z	MTecknology	Starnestommy	o... never knew that
2009-01-12T10:54:00.000Z	Starnestommy	MTecknology	I think atd is used for scheduling tasks
2009-01-12T10:54:00.000Z	MTecknology	Starnestommy	ya - I just don't know if the system has tasks setup to use it by default or not
2009-01-12T10:54:00.000Z	MTecknology	Starnestommy	same question for cron
2009-01-12T10:55:00.000Z	Starnestommy	MTecknology	cron is used for running repetitive tasks at a scheduled time, such as checking for package updates or rotating logs
2009-01-12T10:55:00.000Z	MTecknology	Starnestommy	i know this
2009-01-12T10:56:00.000Z	MTecknology	Starnestommy	is it used by a default installation or is it safe to turn off
2009-01-12T10:56:00.000Z	Starnestommy	MTecknology	it is used by default
2009-01-12T10:56:00.000Z	MTecknology	Starnestommy	both?
2009-01-12T10:57:00.000Z	Starnestommy	MTecknology	I'm not sure about atd.  It might be used for something
2009-01-12T10:57:00.000Z	MTecknology	Starnestommy	what does cron get used by?
2009-01-12T10:58:00.000Z	Starnestommy	MTecknology	things that must be run on a regular basis, such as log rotation, checking for package updates, running ntp, and refreshing the search database for locate
2009-01-12T10:59:00.000Z	MTecknology	Starnestommy	please read my question...
2009-01-12T10:59:00.000Z	MTecknology	Starnestommy	I'm asking about what uses these services on a default installation
2009-01-12T11:00:00.000Z	Starnestommy	MTecknology	everything listed in /etc/cron.*
2009-01-12T11:00:00.000Z	MTecknology	Starnestommy	I'm not a noob - I know what at and cronn are for - I need to figure out if the system uses them on a default installation
2009-01-12T11:01:00.000Z	MTecknology	Starnestommy	alrighty - thanks
2009-01-12T11:01:00.000Z	MTecknology	Starnestommy	looks like I can kill atd and leave cron :)
