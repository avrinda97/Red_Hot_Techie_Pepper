2007-04-15T05:42:00.000Z	Faugn	ataq	what are you looking for exactly?
2007-04-15T05:39:00.000Z	Faugn	ataq	gcc -print-search-dirs
2007-04-15T05:48:00.000Z	Faugn	ataq	trying to compile a kernel module?
2007-04-15T05:49:00.000Z	ataq	Faugn	dont know much about GCC, but I need to find the directory of C header
2007-04-15T05:49:00.000Z	Faugn	ataq	which one?
2007-04-15T05:50:00.000Z	ataq	Faugn	how do you mean
2007-04-15T05:51:00.000Z	Faugn	ataq	if you want to see, for example where is the stdio.h you use for your program, you can only preprocess the source, and look for line like this:  1 "/usr/include/stdlib.h" 1 3 4
2007-04-15T05:52:00.000Z	Faugn	ataq	now if you missing a header for compilation....
2007-04-15T05:52:00.000Z	ataq	Faugn	think I am missing the header
2007-04-15T05:53:00.000Z	Faugn	ataq	what are you trying to compile?
2007-04-15T05:53:00.000Z	ataq	Faugn	vmware on x64
2007-04-15T05:54:00.000Z	Faugn	ataq	ah, the perl configuration script for the modules?
2007-04-15T05:54:00.000Z	ataq	Faugn	ya, thats the one
2007-04-15T05:55:00.000Z	ataq	Faugn	yep, I have indeed
2007-04-15T05:56:00.000Z	Faugn	ataq	and you have GCC installed? everything to compile?
2007-04-15T05:56:00.000Z	ataq	Faugn	Ya, Its strange, never happend me before installing
2007-04-15T05:57:00.000Z	Faugn	ataq	well, good luck :)
2007-04-15T05:58:00.000Z	ataq	Faugn	Thanks for your help, I will get it going. just something small I have left out probably. Qemu isnt as good!
2007-04-15T05:58:00.000Z	Faugn	ataq	it's really getting there :) maybe not for windows...
2007-04-15T05:59:00.000Z	Faugn	ataq	havn't try kvm or xen, I need a new PC...
2007-04-15T05:59:00.000Z	ataq	Faugn	I wanna try out ReactOS
2007-04-15T05:59:00.000Z	ataq	Faugn	Xen is pretty cool
2007-04-15T06:00:00.000Z	Faugn	ataq	you tried quemu with the kernel module to accelerate things?
2007-04-15T06:00:00.000Z	ataq	Faugn	nope, I havent tried Qemu in a while now. any good?
