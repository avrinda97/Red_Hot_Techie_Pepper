2005-11-07T10:24:00.000Z	Greg_Wah		I've installed MySql and when I try and start/do anything with it, I get the error "error: 'Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock' (2)'

2005-11-07T10:25:00.000Z	robotgeek	Greg_Wah	ah, okay...
2005-11-07T10:25:00.000Z	robotgeek	Greg_Wah	did you install the 4.1 version or just plain mysql-server?
2005-11-07T10:26:00.000Z	Greg_Wah	robotgeek	I've installed both at various points of trying to get it to work but last thing I did was to uninstall the 4.1 components via synaptic and install plain mysql-server
2005-11-07T10:27:00.000Z	robotgeek	Greg_Wah	I had the same problem, 4.0 has a known bug. install 4.1, and i'll try to guide u thru it. went thru the same thing two days ago
2005-11-07T10:27:00.000Z	Greg_Wah	robotgeek	Thanks a lot, I'll give it a go now
