2007-08-04T09:14:00.000Z	cafuego	rockets	ffmpeg should read ogg theora just fine, the other way around is a bit trickier (using ffmpeg to convert TO ogg)

2007-09-01T09:10:00.000Z	rockets	cafuego	it works just fine with any MUA if youre willing to use POP or IMAP
2007-09-01T09:10:00.000Z	rockets	cafuego	but I want the whole shared contacts/calendars thing
2007-09-01T09:10:00.000Z	cafuego	rockets	Yes, that's what ldap/caldav is for.
2007-09-01T09:11:00.000Z	cafuego	rockets	Not Exchange can't do that, so needs fixing.
2007-09-01T09:11:00.000Z	rockets	cafuego	yes but exchange uses exchange calendaring. and its not going to change any time soon.
2007-09-01T09:11:00.000Z	rockets	cafuego	Thing is, I COULD use evolution. but evolution SUCKS
2007-09-01T09:11:00.000Z	cafuego	rockets	Sucky MAPI nonsense, I don't think anyone sane would volunteers to implement that for free.

2007-09-01T09:13:00.000Z	rockets	cafuego	we DONT use exchange, we use communigate pro, it just happens to support mapi
2007-09-01T09:14:00.000Z	cafuego	rockets	Eudora does mapi, and was free or going to be free last time i checked, maybe have a look at that
