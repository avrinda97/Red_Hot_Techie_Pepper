2009-01-22T17:57:00.000Z	mikevankuik		How do I change the password of a user ? I can't remember its password... I'm root so I should be able to do something with passwd right? I'm not sure how to use it... can anyone help me!?
2009-01-22T17:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mikevankuik	sudo passwd <username>
2009-01-22T17:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mikevankuik	if its your own password, just use passwd
2009-01-22T17:58:00.000Z	mikevankuik	ActionParsnip	its not my own :) its an other users pass :)
2009-01-22T17:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mikevankuik	then the first command is yours provided your account is a member of admin (can sudo)
2009-02-06T15:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mikevankuik	sure
2009-02-06T15:41:00.000Z	mikevankuik	ActionParsnip	you think it would work from a virtual environment to a rl situation too?\
2009-02-06T15:41:00.000Z	mikevankuik	ActionParsnip	then I could create the RAID1 out of my firewire disks and then port it too the real thing
2009-02-06T15:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mikevankuik	sure, the disks will be setup, the raid will just have to be moved and the raid config setup in the new system
2009-02-06T15:44:00.000Z	mikevankuik	ActionParsnip	so it won't be plug and play? :( (well I guess I could have guessed)
2009-02-06T15:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mikevankuik	no, what you are doing is huely complex, hence why you need specil hardware
2009-02-06T15:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mikevankuik	all you will need to do is tell the raid controller the level of raid and to use thoe drives
2009-02-06T15:46:00.000Z	mikevankuik	ActionParsnip	ok so in short I will have to rebuild the RAID setting again when I port it to the real system?
2009-02-06T15:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mikevankuik	yes, the data on the drives will be configured, you will just have to setup the raid setup in the controller
2009-02-06T15:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mikevankuik	do a basic test, install an OS to it with no drivers or anythin and move it over
2009-02-06T15:49:00.000Z	mikevankuik	ActionParsnip	seems like I've got some work cut out for me then...
2009-02-06T15:49:00.000Z	mikevankuik	ActionParsnip	I don't need an OS on it :) its just for data :)
2009-02-06T15:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mikevankuik	then write a few files to the drive then test, same deal just faster
2009-02-06T15:52:00.000Z	mikevankuik	ActionParsnip	I did the trick with 2 internal disks and my ubuntu server runs perfect I'm just a bit nervous because I don't want to kill that setting  while creating the RAID 1 setting with the external disks :)
2009-02-06T15:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mikevankuik	well you are only using a few files to test before applying the real data so it doesnt matter
2009-02-06T15:54:00.000Z	mikevankuik	ActionParsnip	its not the data disks I'm worried about :) its my internal RAID that I don't want to kill off :) (but I'm creating a VM at te moment zo I can try what you said :) without having being afraid of killing something :)
2009-02-06T15:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mikevankuik	if you are worried, run your backup before youo begin
2009-02-06T16:00:00.000Z	mikevankuik	ActionParsnip	I'll try the stuff on a VM first :) then I can do it on the server with confidence ^_^ and without worries :) (of course I've got stuff backed up :) but that doesn't mean I want toe rebuild the raid if shit goes wrong :P by something stupid I'd be able to do :D)
2009-02-06T16:00:00.000Z	mikevankuik	ActionParsnip	so I'll try it first on the VM then in rl :)
