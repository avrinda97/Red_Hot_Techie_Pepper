2007-01-04T11:47:00.000Z	LameBMX	elyon	sudo first? .. /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2007-01-04T11:47:00.000Z	elyon	LameBMX	 Yeah... he just forgot the X11 part ;)
2007-01-04T11:47:00.000Z	LameBMX	elyon	or sudo nano /e<tab>X<tab>xo<tab>
2007-01-04T12:50:00.000Z	LameBMX	elyon	you know how during grub you can edit a line by pressing "e"
2007-01-04T12:42:00.000Z	LameBMX	elyon	what rez is your login screen running?
2007-01-04T12:44:00.000Z	elyon	LameBMX	 It appears to be running at 1280x1024.
2007-01-04T12:45:00.000Z	elyon	LameBMX	 My xorg.conf only lists 1024x768 (which is what I want) and lower.
2007-01-04T12:45:00.000Z	LameBMX	elyon	and this is a problem beeeccccaaauuuussseee?
2007-01-04T12:45:00.000Z	elyon	LameBMX	 Because I have a 17 inch monitor AND because that resolution screwed up my mouse.
2007-01-04T12:47:00.000Z	LameBMX	elyon	go here and about halfway down you will see a box to set ur framebuffer resolution .. http://www.oreilly.com/pub/h/3124
2007-01-04T12:48:00.000Z	LameBMX	elyon	test it first by changing the grub boot options with e on the os select and adding in vga=795 (for me)
2007-01-04T12:48:00.000Z	LameBMX	elyon	if that fixes it add it to your /boot/grub/menu.lst
2007-01-04T12:49:00.000Z	elyon	LameBMX	 You lost me, bud...
2007-01-04T12:49:00.000Z	LameBMX	elyon	i had the exact opposite issue .. 17" lcd ... looks like crap on anything but 1280x1024 .. doing that option force FB to 1280x1024 .. which forced the login manager to the FB rez .. which
2007-01-04T12:50:00.000Z	elyon	LameBMX	 No, I didn't know
2007-01-04T12:51:00.000Z	LameBMX	elyon	look up on grub a bit .. cuz this is a bit tough to explain when you havent done it .....
2007-01-04T10:37:00.000Z	LameBMX	elyon	have you ever thought of this as a mouse issue and not a resolution issue?
2007-01-04T10:38:00.000Z	elyon	LameBMX	 My mouse works perfectly
2007-01-04T10:39:00.000Z	elyon	LameBMX	 At higher resolutions in Linux, my mouse cursor doesn't appear where it should.  meaning clicking buttons does nothing, but clicking an empty space may activate the button I tried to click on... make sense?
2007-01-04T10:39:00.000Z	LameBMX	elyon	i think thats a mouse issue lol ...
2007-01-04T10:40:00.000Z	elyon	LameBMX	 Just say you don't understand... because its 100% not related to the mouse... its graphical.
2007-01-04T10:41:00.000Z	LameBMX	elyon	and you know this how ... i know you have been struggling with this issue for a short while now ...
2007-01-04T10:41:00.000Z	LameBMX	elyon	and it being a mouse issue is definately a possibility
2007-01-04T10:41:00.000Z	elyon	LameBMX	 Well, because my mouse works perfectly otherwise.  Its the mouse POINTER that is not being consistant.
