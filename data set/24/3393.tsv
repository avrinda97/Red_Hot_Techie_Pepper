2008-10-14T11:21:00.000Z	Sindacious		Anyone know how to make ubuntu detect a mybook external hard drive?
2008-10-14T11:21:00.000Z	chaddy	Sindacious	plug it in then do dmesg|tail, see if it is detected

2008-10-14T11:26:00.000Z	chaddy	Sindacious	possible solution http://kerneltrap.org/node/2963
2008-10-14T11:29:00.000Z	Sindacious	chaddy	I'm not sure what I'm looking for on that page
2008-10-14T11:32:00.000Z	chaddy	Sindacious	it's all there, I don't know what more you want, second comment onward
2008-10-14T11:33:00.000Z	Sindacious	chaddy	insmod sbp2 sbp2_max_speed=1 returns "insmod: can't read 'sbp2': No such file or directory
2008-10-14T11:39:00.000Z	chaddy	Sindacious	try this http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=6631&highlight=isnmod+spb2
2008-10-14T11:41:00.000Z	Sindacious	chaddy	how would I update the modules? (after editing the file)
2008-10-14T11:44:00.000Z	chaddy	Sindacious	if you look at man modules it might become clear
2008-10-14T11:53:00.000Z	Sindacious	chaddy	all I could come across what update-modules, which is deprecated
2008-10-14T11:53:00.000Z	chaddy	Sindacious	/etc/modules is read at boot
2008-10-14T11:54:00.000Z	Sindacious	chaddy	yeah, I got that, was hoping there was a way to avoid that :p
2008-10-14T11:54:00.000Z	chaddy	Sindacious	there probably is, I don't know it offhand, would a reboot kill you?
2008-10-14T11:55:00.000Z	Sindacious	chaddy	nah, I'm going to in a few minutes, making sure I put the line in right.
2008-10-14T12:28:00.000Z	Sindacious	chaddy	I think that solved the firewire part, any idea how I'd know if the external is connected?
2008-10-14T12:28:00.000Z	chaddy	Sindacious	plug it in and dmesg|tail again
2008-10-14T12:30:00.000Z	Sindacious	chaddy	http://pastebin.com/d26d91fe0
2008-10-14T12:31:00.000Z	chaddy	Sindacious	that looks like the same error to me
2008-10-14T12:32:00.000Z	chaddy	Sindacious	I'd put together a forum post at this point, probably cross post to that one I linked you earlier
2008-10-14T12:32:00.000Z	Sindacious	chaddy	yeah I noticed it after the pastebin ;x does the line "sbp2 serialize=1" need to be put in the /etc/modules any certain way? I added a new line for it.
2008-10-14T12:34:00.000Z	chaddy	Sindacious	I'd guess at least with the underscore, should be good to copy and paste from that post
2008-10-14T12:35:00.000Z	Sindacious	chaddy	hmm, I put the line below the sbp2 module itself, I'm going to try it with deleting that line I put in and put serialize=1 after the module and see if it makes a difference
2008-10-14T12:37:00.000Z	chaddy	Sindacious	sorry, don't really know much more, been flying blind til now
