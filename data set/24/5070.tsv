2007-02-14T14:26:00.000Z	dxdt	newest007	mmmmmm
2007-02-14T14:26:00.000Z	dxdt	newest007	port forward?
2007-02-14T14:26:00.000Z	dxdt	newest007	why?
2007-02-14T14:28:00.000Z	dxdt	newest007	you keep saying that, but I don't think it means what you think it means.  To put it another way, I installed azureus and only port forwarded my router.  Since Ubuntu, by default, had everything else open for me as I could see with sudo iptables -L
2007-02-14T14:28:00.000Z	dxdt	newest007	I don't think adding iptable rules is going to change that though.  I think the problem lies elsewhere.  I personally have noticed that sometimes azureus will just choke and tell me I'm firewalled when it isn't and then I'll restart and it will be fine
2007-02-14T14:29:00.000Z	dxdt	newest007	restart azureus that is.  I'm looking gimme a sec
2007-02-14T14:31:00.000Z	dxdt	newest007	do me a favor and type sudo iptables all and look at the default policy for each of the three things.  I'm just curious because I actually feel that the guide you are looking at is wrong....
2007-02-14T14:33:00.000Z	dxdt	newest007	I meant sudo iptables -L  sorry about that
2007-02-14T14:33:00.000Z	dxdt	newest007	yeah I messed up I meant sudo iptables -L
2007-02-14T14:35:00.000Z	dxdt	newest007	use that site
2007-02-14T14:39:00.000Z	dxdt	newest007	so yeah, ok, the weird thing is that my iptables on Ubuntu were setup by default to accept everything, yours aren't.  That's why you are having problems and that's why I was confused.
2007-02-14T14:39:00.000Z	dxdt	newest007	ok
2007-02-14T14:40:00.000Z	dxdt	newest007	that makes sense then.  Haha Ok so basically whatever firewall you installed at that time changed the rules of your machine and that's why I didn't have to forward the ports but you do.
2007-02-14T14:49:00.000Z	dxdt	newest007	if you aren't using those firewalls anyway, I would just do sudo apt-get remove firestarter.  Then restart then do sudo iptables -L and see if it is nice and clean again
2007-02-14T14:51:00.000Z	dxdt	newest007	paste bin what the new sudo iptables _L did to make sure it is nice and clean.
2007-02-14T14:55:00.000Z	dxdt	newest007	ok, everything is open
