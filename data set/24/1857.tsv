2009-07-22T07:18:00.000Z	adrian_2002ca	SealV	how, im not sure
2009-07-22T07:16:00.000Z	SealV	adrian_2002ca	what are you trying to change?
2009-07-22T07:17:00.000Z	adrian_2002ca	SealV	when I click and drag on the desktop for example, an orange selection rectangle appears. I want to change the color of that to something else
2009-07-22T07:17:00.000Z	SealV	adrian_2002ca	ok there are basically two ways to change it
2009-07-22T07:17:00.000Z	SealV	adrian_2002ca	the easy way and the slily harder way
2009-07-22T07:18:00.000Z	adrian_2002ca	SealV	ok, im listening
2009-07-22T07:18:00.000Z	SealV	adrian_2002ca	the easy way if your theme allows it (try this first)
2009-07-22T07:18:00.000Z	SealV	adrian_2002ca	go to appearance>>theme tab>>custamoize>>colors
2009-07-22T07:19:00.000Z	SealV	adrian_2002ca	can you click any of the color boxes>
2009-07-22T07:19:00.000Z	adrian_2002ca	SealV	COOL, it worked, thanks so much
2009-07-22T07:20:00.000Z	adrian_2002ca	SealV	an internets to you sir :D
2009-07-22T07:20:00.000Z	SealV	adrian_2002ca	np the slightly harder way is to edit your gtkrc file in /home/user/.themes/<theme>/gtk 2.0/gtkrc
2009-07-22T07:21:00.000Z	SealV	adrian_2002ca	 that will work for all themes. the more you know right
