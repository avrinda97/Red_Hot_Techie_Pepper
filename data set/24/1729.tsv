2011-06-14T20:52:00.000Z	theadmin	zamba	Depends on your purposes
2011-06-14T20:53:00.000Z	theadmin	zamba	dd if=/dev/sdz of=file.diskimage
2011-06-14T20:53:00.000Z	zamba	theadmin	won't that create a huge file?
2011-06-14T20:53:00.000Z	zamba	theadmin	what about file size limitations?
2011-06-14T20:53:00.000Z	theadmin	zamba	Yes, it will, but you just said you want to back up the whole disk
2011-06-14T20:53:00.000Z	zamba	theadmin	so there's no max file size?
2011-08-16T13:05:00.000Z	theadmin	zamba	There are many ways, unetbootin, usb-creator, lili
2011-08-16T13:07:00.000Z	zamba	theadmin	what works?
2011-08-16T13:07:00.000Z	theadmin	zamba	All of those I listed would work with Ubuntu.
2011-08-16T13:07:00.000Z	zamba	theadmin	as i said, this is not about installing ubuntu
2011-11-04T12:23:00.000Z	theadmin	zamba	Vim, and :set list
2011-11-04T12:23:00.000Z	zamba	theadmin	ah.. what does ^I mean? that's a tab, right?
2011-11-04T12:24:00.000Z	zamba	theadmin	\t
2011-11-04T12:24:00.000Z	theadmin	zamba	I would suppose so, it has weird codes for things
2012-05-28T21:07:00.000Z	theadmin	zamba	My idea is you'll get unallocated space, but I'm not sure
2012-11-07T18:58:00.000Z	theadmin	zamba	linux-headers-generic
2012-11-07T18:58:00.000Z	theadmin	zamba	Or linux-headers-whatever-kind-of-kernel-you-are-using
2012-11-07T18:58:00.000Z	zamba	theadmin	well.. i want that package to be upgraded with the kernel
2012-11-07T18:58:00.000Z	theadmin	zamba	It will be
2012-11-07T18:59:00.000Z	theadmin	zamba	Long as you're using an official kernel
