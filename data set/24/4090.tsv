2007-07-15T06:19:00.000Z	akos		hello! I just succeded in setting up an open w/less network, but i cant get wep working. is it a major security problem, if i installed mac filtering? Or what guides can you suggest, if i enable wep, i can't get a connection
2007-07-15T06:20:00.000Z	rasputnik	akos	wep is a waste of time security wise, so I wouldn't bother
2007-07-15T06:22:00.000Z	rasputnik	akos	wpa is fine, it's built into network manager
2007-07-15T06:23:00.000Z	akos	rasputnik	is it?
2007-07-15T06:23:00.000Z	rasputnik	akos	yes
2007-07-15T06:23:00.000Z	akos	rasputnik	oh, I can get a connection ONLY in roaming mode... why could that be? If I choose no security, and enter my ssid (actually it detects it and i choose from the dropdown list), i get no connection
2007-07-15T06:24:00.000Z	rasputnik	akos	when is this? during the install, or on your desktop
2007-07-15T06:24:00.000Z	rasputnik	akos	are you running feisty?
2007-07-15T06:24:00.000Z	akos	rasputnik	its a laptop
2007-07-15T06:24:00.000Z	akos	rasputnik	yes of course
2007-07-15T06:25:00.000Z	rasputnik	akos	then up in the top-left you've got your network applet. that can do wpa, wep, open, whatever. don't use the networking prefs screens, they don't do wpa
2007-07-15T06:25:00.000Z	akos	rasputnik	and there is only wep encryption integrated in the netwoek manager
2007-07-15T06:26:00.000Z	rasputnik	akos	no there isn't. i've been using wpa with network manager for 2 years
2007-07-15T06:26:00.000Z	rasputnik	akos	what wireless nic do you have?
2007-07-15T06:26:00.000Z	akos	rasputnik	the applet has the wpa...
2007-07-15T06:27:00.000Z	rasputnik	akos	the applet is the frontend to networkmanager (a backend daemon)
2007-07-15T06:28:00.000Z	rasputnik	akos	the control panel (whatever it's called this week) doesn't no. don't use that, and you'll be fine.
2007-07-15T06:28:00.000Z	akos	rasputnik	i see no wpa2_
2007-07-15T06:29:00.000Z	akos	rasputnik	 heh
2007-07-15T06:29:00.000Z	akos	rasputnik	i still see no wpa2 in the applet... ?
2007-07-15T06:31:00.000Z	rasputnik	akos	you should see a list of wireless lans. you connect to one and it will sort out authentication for you
2007-07-15T06:32:00.000Z	rasputnik	akos	I'm talking about the applet on the menubar in the top right, not the crap in admin->networking (which is rubbish)
2007-07-15T06:32:00.000Z	rasputnik	akos	so until you enable wpa, it wont' show up as an option
2007-07-15T06:33:00.000Z	rasputnik	akos	enable it in the access point, I mean
