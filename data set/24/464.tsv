2011-08-16T13:54:00.000Z	ricky26		Does anyone know where I'd look if Ubuntu is being weird with a specific USB device?
2011-08-16T13:55:00.000Z	whoppergator	ricky26	did you look at your dmesg output already?
2011-08-16T13:55:00.000Z	ricky26	whoppergator	Yeah, nothing.
2011-08-16T13:55:00.000Z	ricky26	whoppergator	Pressing buttons on the USB device causes gdm to restart. ;P
2011-08-16T13:55:00.000Z	whoppergator	ricky26	wow, lovely. kernel issue?
2011-08-16T13:56:00.000Z	ricky26	whoppergator	I'm hoping it's not a problem with kernel, because the device has no specific drivers.
2011-08-16T13:56:00.000Z	ricky26	whoppergator	It's a usb audo/HID hybrid all the info is in the descriptors.
2011-08-16T13:58:00.000Z	whoppergator	ricky26	i don't think i can help much without more info, what exactly is the device?
2011-08-16T13:59:00.000Z	ricky26	whoppergator	Logitech G930
2011-08-16T13:59:00.000Z	ricky26	whoppergator	I am just fighting lsusb for the descriptors
2011-08-16T13:59:00.000Z	whoppergator	ricky26	oO, is that a camera?
2011-08-16T13:59:00.000Z	ricky26	whoppergator	No
2011-08-16T13:59:00.000Z	ricky26	whoppergator	Don't ask about the logitech webcam on my desk
2011-08-16T13:59:00.000Z	ricky26	whoppergator	That causes lock-ups in Linux
2011-08-16T14:00:00.000Z	ricky26	whoppergator	I shoulda learned really. ;P
2011-08-16T14:00:00.000Z	whoppergator	ricky26	haha, yeah sounds like kernel issues, sorry i'm not more helpful
2011-08-16T14:00:00.000Z	ricky26	whoppergator	Yeah, the camera one definitely is.
2011-08-16T14:00:00.000Z	ricky26	whoppergator	It's due to Linux being far too optimistic in usbcore.
2011-08-16T14:01:00.000Z	ricky26	whoppergator	But the G930 is a pita, because sometimes it works fine, and just replugging doesn't seem to fix. I have to reboot. Which makes me think it's a service setting it up crazy.
2011-08-16T14:03:00.000Z	ricky26	whoppergator	Argh, I think I'm gonna have to believe it's logitech being shite with USB again.
2011-08-16T14:03:00.000Z	whoppergator	ricky26	yeah, i have a dual-boot desktop that makes me unplug the mouse and plug it back in everytime i switch, or the scroll wheel will go into SUPER sensitive mode
2011-08-16T14:03:00.000Z	ricky26	whoppergator	lol
2011-08-16T14:04:00.000Z	ricky26	whoppergator	Thanks for your thoughts on my problem btw. :)
2011-08-16T14:05:00.000Z	whoppergator	ricky26	np! :)
