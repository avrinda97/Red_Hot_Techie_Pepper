2007-04-11T06:17:00.000Z	Ubuntu_noob	reep	you're right. it's the bios.
2007-04-11T06:17:00.000Z	reep	Ubuntu_noob	you got it working?
2007-04-11T06:18:00.000Z	Ubuntu_noob	reep	nope, but I noticed that one the first boot, it stat that the hard drive that held linux weren't dectected.
2007-04-11T06:19:00.000Z	Ubuntu_noob	reep	that means I have to flash the bios for an update right ?
2007-04-11T06:20:00.000Z	reep	Ubuntu_noob	perhaps, or it could be that maybe the jumpers are wrong (if it's ata disk)
2007-04-11T06:22:00.000Z	Ubuntu_noob	reep	it can't be the jumper because it's been jumped the way it's since two months ago
2007-04-11T06:24:00.000Z	Ubuntu_noob	reep	btw, what is the full command to edit device map ?
2007-04-11T06:25:00.000Z	reep	Ubuntu_noob	I guess that would be sudo gedit /boot/grub/device.map
2007-04-11T06:26:00.000Z	reep	Ubuntu_noob	but I doubt changing anything in there will help
2007-04-11T06:27:00.000Z	Ubuntu_noob	reep	what will happen when I delete one of the entry in device.map ?
2007-04-11T06:29:00.000Z	Ubuntu_noob	reep	thanks for all the help. highly appriciated
2007-04-11T06:29:00.000Z	Ubuntu_noob	reep	cya
2007-04-11T06:29:00.000Z	reep	Ubuntu_noob	I don't know... not sure if grub actually reads it, I think it just creates it to help in editing menu.lst
2007-04-11T06:29:00.000Z	reep	Ubuntu_noob	your welcome :)
2007-04-11T06:36:00.000Z	Ubuntu_noob	reep	weird, it booted nomarlly after I deleted the entry that held xp
2007-04-11T06:37:00.000Z	reep	Ubuntu_noob	weird indeed, does it still boot windows then?
2007-04-11T06:37:00.000Z	Ubuntu_noob	reep	I havn't tried to boot in to M$ yet.
2007-04-11T06:38:00.000Z	Ubuntu_noob	reep	imma try
2007-04-11T06:43:00.000Z	Ubuntu_noob	reep	yes, I could boot in to m$ as well, but the issues occurs again after booted in to m$
2007-04-11T06:45:00.000Z	reep	Ubuntu_noob	hm, very odd...
2007-04-11T06:46:00.000Z	Ubuntu_noob	reep	do you have any clue what might or is causing such conflict ?
2007-04-11T06:47:00.000Z	reep	Ubuntu_noob	no, sorry, this seems to be out of my league. You could try the forums and see if anyone else have a similar problem...
2007-04-11T06:49:00.000Z	Ubuntu_noob	reep	nope, no luck in the forum. couldn't find any solution yet. I guess I will just stick with issues, since it doesn't seemed to be a big deal. anyways, thanks for your assistant.
2007-04-11T06:49:00.000Z	reep	Ubuntu_noob	ok, hope you get it sorted some day
