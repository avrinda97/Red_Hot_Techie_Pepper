2010-01-27T20:23:00.000Z	Emanon		So I'm trying to use the Ubuntu Virtual Machine Manager to set up a virtual machine on a physical disk (so i can boot into it directly later) and it keeps failing to add the drive citing a package i already have anyone have any clue as to why?
2010-01-27T20:25:00.000Z	nowonmai	Emanon	what is the package?
2010-01-27T20:27:00.000Z	nowonmai	Emanon	python-virtinst? What is the message you are getting?
2010-01-27T20:27:00.000Z	nowonmai	Emanon	ok

2010-01-27T20:33:00.000Z	nowonmai	Emanon	what device are you passing to virt-install to create the VM on?
2010-01-27T20:33:00.000Z	Emanon	nowonmai	a 500g pata hard disk
2010-01-27T20:34:00.000Z	Emanon	nowonmai	on /dev/sde
2010-01-27T20:34:00.000Z	nowonmai	Emanon	gotcha... are you passing in the device name or a partition? /dev/sde or /dev/sdeX?
2010-01-27T20:35:00.000Z	Emanon	nowonmai	/dev/sde since i want it to have the whole drive
2010-01-27T20:36:00.000Z	nowonmai	Emanon	yeah, that would be correct, if you wanted to boot from it later... I'm at a bit of a loss... there's no record of any current issues like this... are you using Xen or KVM? What Ubuntu version?
2010-01-27T20:37:00.000Z	Emanon	nowonmai	karmic kvm
2010-01-27T20:37:00.000Z	Emanon	nowonmai	64 bit ubuntu if that is an issue
2010-01-27T20:38:00.000Z	nowonmai	Emanon	hmmm... me too... I don't have a hdd to hand to try it on at the moment... if I think of anything I'll PM
2010-01-27T20:38:00.000Z	nowonmai	Emanon	you could always create it as an img and then dd it to the hdd :)
2010-01-27T20:39:00.000Z	Emanon	nowonmai	well i can just install it nativly but i want to be able to virtualize it AND boot into it
2010-01-27T20:39:00.000Z	Emanon	nowonmai	so i dont have to have two full installs
2010-01-27T20:39:00.000Z	Emanon	nowonmai	i mean i have 2.5tb but still no need to waste space right?
2010-01-27T20:40:00.000Z	nowonmai	Emanon	indeed... leave it with me... I'll see if anything springs to mind
2010-01-27T20:40:00.000Z	Emanon	nowonmai	it works in virtualbox but i want to do a 64 bit install and vb can only handle 32
