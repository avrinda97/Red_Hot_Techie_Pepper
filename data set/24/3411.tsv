2009-08-16T19:38:00.000Z	masquerade	nascentmind	change it
2009-08-16T19:38:00.000Z	masquerade	nascentmind	default keys, although theyre generated are easy to crack
2009-08-16T19:39:00.000Z	nascentmind	masquerade	anyway i can make my linksys generate it again?
2009-08-16T19:39:00.000Z	masquerade	nascentmind	i think s
2009-08-16T19:39:00.000Z	nascentmind	masquerade	resetting the modem? or is there any easy way to generate these keys?
2009-08-16T19:40:00.000Z	masquerade	nascentmind	it should be in the admin interface
2009-08-16T19:41:00.000Z	nascentmind	masquerade	well the linksys admin page does not have an option of generating a key.
2009-08-16T19:42:00.000Z	masquerade	nascentmind	resetting should to it also. why do you even want to restore to an automatically generated one?
2009-08-16T19:42:00.000Z	nascentmind	masquerade	no i don't want to. i will just type out a big passphrase.
2009-08-16T19:43:00.000Z	nascentmind	masquerade	just wanted to know whether its a hardcoded one or truly machine generated.
2009-08-16T19:43:00.000Z	masquerade	nascentmind	this depends on the model
2009-08-16T19:44:00.000Z	nascentmind	masquerade	the setup of linksys made me go through the checklist. i have a linksys wag54g2.
2009-08-16T19:45:00.000Z	masquerade	nascentmind	wait, i thought we were talking about a router?
2009-08-16T19:46:00.000Z	nascentmind	masquerade	yes its a wireless adsl2+ modem router
2009-08-16T19:46:00.000Z	masquerade	nascentmind	you dont need any drivers for a router
2009-08-16T19:47:00.000Z	nascentmind	masquerade	yes. this was a small software which comes with it which helps you setup the modem rather than go through the admin page. it works on windows and mac though.
2009-08-16T19:47:00.000Z	masquerade	nascentmind	i dont think you really need it
2009-08-16T19:48:00.000Z	nascentmind	masquerade	yes. its just a convenience rather than going through the admin page to set it up to prevent missing something.
2009-08-16T19:48:00.000Z	masquerade	nascentmind	yo..
2009-08-16T19:50:00.000Z	nascentmind	masquerade	anyways will change the preshared key. are uuid's good enough. it has a good set of alphabets and numerals.
2009-08-16T19:50:00.000Z	masquerade	nascentmind	okay
2009-08-16T19:54:00.000Z	nascentmind	masquerade	thanks
