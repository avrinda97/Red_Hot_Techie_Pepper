2010-03-10T01:30:00.000Z	qUaNtiC_		i dunno itz a toshiba L555
2010-03-10T01:31:00.000Z	blakkheim	qUaNtiC_	use a distro that isn't so far behind or wait until april when ubuntu 10.04 is stable
2010-03-10T01:28:00.000Z	blakkheim	qUaNtiC_	it's possible
2010-03-10T01:28:00.000Z	qUaNtiC_	blakkheim	-_- ive tried that before with other laps and it wasnt, i need to no, driverz and stuff
2010-03-10T01:29:00.000Z	blakkheim	qUaNtiC_	please type out your words so it's easier to understand what you're trying to say. you can try a live cd to make sure all your hardware will work.
2010-03-10T01:30:00.000Z	qUaNtiC_	blakkheim	tried that already and "no screens found" wouldnt even start in live-sys so i guess there's not video-drivers for linux?
2010-03-10T01:30:00.000Z	blakkheim	qUaNtiC_	what graphics card does it have?
2010-03-10T01:31:00.000Z	blakkheim	qUaNtiC_	it has the core i3 graphics, which is not supported in ubuntu due to its old kernel
2010-03-10T01:31:00.000Z	blakkheim	qUaNtiC_	you need kernel 2.6.33 or higher for those graphics to work properly in linux
2010-03-10T01:31:00.000Z	qUaNtiC_	blakkheim	so what can i do?
2010-03-10T01:32:00.000Z	qUaNtiC_	blakkheim	i was using 8.10, du think karmic koala will be ok?
2010-03-10T01:32:00.000Z	blakkheim	qUaNtiC_	no
2010-03-10T01:33:00.000Z	qUaNtiC_	blakkheim	anyway, instead of having to get here bothering you guys, where can i find this type of info?
2010-03-10T01:33:00.000Z	blakkheim	qUaNtiC_	google
2010-03-10T01:33:00.000Z	qUaNtiC_	blakkheim	but i tried, and found nothing!!!
2010-03-10T01:35:00.000Z	qUaNtiC_	blakkheim	i meant where could i find that L555 had the i3 core graphic which is not supported in ubuntu, but will be in the next distro? where is it written? could u point me at some sites? thanks
2010-03-10T01:35:00.000Z	blakkheim	qUaNtiC_	i just googled the laptop's model and looked at the specs on toshiba's site
2010-03-10T01:36:00.000Z	blakkheim	qUaNtiC_	it's not supported in the current version of ubuntu but will most likely work in april with 10.04 comes out
2010-03-10T01:37:00.000Z	qUaNtiC_	blakkheim	alright about the specs, but how do you no i3 is not supported by the current distros?
2010-03-10T01:37:00.000Z	blakkheim	qUaNtiC_	that's just current linux knowledge, read kernel changelogs from kernel.org
2010-03-10T01:38:00.000Z	qUaNtiC_	blakkheim	sorry if i ask for further explanation but, could u be more specific? thank you
2010-03-10T01:38:00.000Z	blakkheim	qUaNtiC_	what do you want me to be specific about? you can see the changes in kernel upgrades at kernel.org, so you can see that in 2.6.33 there was added support for that chipset
2010-03-10T01:40:00.000Z	qUaNtiC_	blakkheim	ok so i go to www.kernel.org and check the kernel's specific and then confront it with my version of the chipset, ok i got it, thank you :D
