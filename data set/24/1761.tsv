2009-09-05T01:19:00.000Z	eaxexee		Hi there, How can I download and install the *latest* version of phpmyadmin? :) The one on the repos is *old* :/
2009-09-05T01:21:00.000Z	iceroot	eaxexee	download it from there website b ut its much better to use the repo version (security updates)
2009-09-05T01:21:00.000Z	eaxexee	iceroot	Okay thanks :) I actually already downloaded it but it seems really difficult to install :S
2009-09-05T01:22:00.000Z	iceroot	eaxexee	no, just extract to the web-dir
2009-09-05T01:22:00.000Z	eaxexee	iceroot	Hmm the webdir? my /var/www?
2009-09-05T01:22:00.000Z	iceroot	eaxexee	yes
2009-09-05T01:22:00.000Z	iceroot	eaxexee	but use the repo version instead
2009-09-05T01:23:00.000Z	eaxexee	iceroot	Okay thanks :) Why? relations doesn't work in it :S
2009-09-05T01:23:00.000Z	iceroot	eaxexee	of course they work
2009-09-05T01:23:00.000Z	iceroot	eaxexee	i am using it too
2009-09-05T01:23:00.000Z	iceroot	eaxexee	relations dont work with myisam but with innodb
2009-09-05T01:23:00.000Z	eaxexee	iceroot	I am running innodb, but when choosing Designs -> dragging a relation it opens a blank pop-u
2009-09-05T01:24:00.000Z	iceroot	eaxexee	which ubuntu?
2009-09-05T01:24:00.000Z	eaxexee	iceroot	9.04
2009-09-05T01:24:00.000Z	iceroot	eaxexee	phpmyadmin from 9.04 can handle relations
2009-09-05T01:24:00.000Z	eaxexee	iceroot	Doesn't seem like mine can :S Others have reported the error too :S
2009-09-05T01:25:00.000Z	eaxexee	iceroot	hmm I'm gonna try installing it again then
2009-09-05T01:26:00.000Z	iceroot	eaxexee	hm, i am using phpmyadmin from debian lenny and this can handle relations and i am sure ubuntu-version is not older then the lenny-version
2009-09-05T01:26:00.000Z	eaxexee	iceroot	hmm okay :S Trying installing again :)
2009-09-05T01:30:00.000Z	eaxexee	iceroot	Trying now
2009-09-05T01:30:00.000Z	eaxexee	iceroot	It only opens a blank window, nothing is created :s
2009-09-05T01:31:00.000Z	iceroot	eaxexee	hm :(
2009-09-05T01:31:00.000Z	iceroot	eaxexee	dont have phpmyadmin on ubuntu here to test it, sorry :(
2009-09-05T01:31:00.000Z	eaxexee	iceroot	Fair, thanks for the help though :) Trying manual install now :)
