2008-04-17T18:14:00.000Z	DracoZA		Any ideas why I am getting: Failed to modify password entry for user username error whenever I use smbpasswd -a username ?
2008-04-17T18:16:00.000Z	ikonia	DracoZA	can it talk to the samba backend ?
2008-04-17T18:18:00.000Z	ikonia	DracoZA	ahhh so this is on a new user
2008-04-17T18:19:00.000Z	DracoZA	ikonia	yup, do I have to add the user via users and groups first, I just want to give them remote access
2008-04-17T18:19:00.000Z	ikonia	DracoZA	the password does not relate to real unix users and groups
2008-04-17T18:20:00.000Z	DracoZA	ikonia	*confused look* how would I go about creating a remote access user then ?
2008-04-17T18:21:00.000Z	ikonia	DracoZA	I'm not quite understanding, you do need to have a matching unix account for the samba account
2008-04-17T18:21:00.000Z	ikonia	DracoZA	but the samba password does not link to the unix password
2008-04-17T18:21:00.000Z	DracoZA	ikonia	ok that answers my question, the user has to be created and then smbpasswd -a... correct ?
2008-04-17T18:22:00.000Z	ikonia	DracoZA	yes
2008-04-17T18:22:00.000Z	DracoZA	ikonia	thanks
2008-04-17T18:22:00.000Z	DracoZA	ikonia	will an unprivileged account work fine ?
2008-04-17T18:22:00.000Z	ikonia	DracoZA	you'll need to be root and run it
2008-04-17T18:23:00.000Z	DracoZA	ikonia	sorry I meant the new user, for remote can they be unprivileged
2008-04-17T18:23:00.000Z	ikonia	DracoZA	totally
2008-04-25T13:31:00.000Z	ikonia	DracoZA	it's dynamic
2008-04-25T13:32:00.000Z	DracoZA	ikonia	dynamic ?
2008-04-25T13:32:00.000Z	ikonia	DracoZA	xorg trys to work out your hardware settings and is overriddent by the xorg config file
2008-04-25T13:33:00.000Z	DracoZA	ikonia	ok, does nvidia-settings have a seperate conf file of some sort ?
2008-04-25T13:33:00.000Z	ikonia	DracoZA	that normally runs in memory
2008-04-25T13:33:00.000Z	ikonia	DracoZA	changes would have to be written to xorg.conf
2008-04-25T13:34:00.000Z	ikonia	DracoZA	no
2008-04-25T13:34:00.000Z	ikonia	DracoZA	you have to tell it to read the files
2008-04-25T13:40:00.000Z	DracoZA	ikonia	I use a nvidia card, will my system work properly if I dont use restricted drivers
