2007-05-02T13:41:00.000Z	dieh		i am looking to install ubuntu and have no idea. i have windows xp installed already. what do i do. do i partition the harddrive first, if yes, how do i do that
2007-05-02T13:41:00.000Z	ajax4	dieh	Have you already made a bootable Ubuntu CD?
2007-05-02T13:42:00.000Z	dieh		no, is that the first step
2007-05-02T13:42:00.000Z	ajax4	dieh	Do you know how to download the Ubuntu cd image (iso file) and burn it?
2007-05-02T13:42:00.000Z	dieh		sure, i dont have a cd at the moment, i can download it from the website and burn it
2007-05-02T13:43:00.000Z	dieh		what do i do after that
2007-05-02T13:43:00.000Z	dieh		oh ok , would i have to install windows after i partition. i dont have the windows cd anymore
2007-05-02T13:43:00.000Z	ajax4	dieh	Just boot your computer from that CD, after it boots double click the "install" icon...then follow the instructions. The biggest part is how to partition the drives. Does your windows disc have free space on it?
2007-05-02T13:44:00.000Z	dieh		yeah, i have about 32gigs free
2007-05-02T13:44:00.000Z	dieh		cool thanks
2007-05-02T13:44:00.000Z	dieh		i will download it tomorrow and put it on a dc
2007-05-02T13:44:00.000Z	dieh		cd
2007-05-02T13:44:00.000Z	ajax4	dieh	Perfect. The Ubuntu installer will automatically resize your windows partition to make room for the Linux partition.
2007-05-02T13:44:00.000Z	dieh		i download from here http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/download right?
2007-05-02T13:45:00.000Z	dieh		i have no idea what is a torrent
2007-05-02T13:45:00.000Z	dieh		cool thanks
2007-05-02T13:46:00.000Z	dieh		oh ok
2007-05-02T13:46:00.000Z	ajax4	dieh	The biggest hurdle for new users is partitioning. Let it guide you through the partitioning, and just indicate that you want to have the installer resize your windows partition to make room for Linux.
