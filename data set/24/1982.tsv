2009-05-31T20:33:00.000Z	zortec		night: Check out LAMP.
2009-05-31T20:35:00.000Z	zortec		This is like a random question, but anyone know like the percentage of users that are on Linux?  I'm interested to know the stats
2009-05-31T20:36:00.000Z	zortec		Also on the ubuntu forums, I noticed ubuntu #10000, how do you sign up for that?
2009-05-31T20:36:00.000Z	zortec		It keeps track of all the users who are on ubuntu.
2009-05-31T20:37:00.000Z	zortec		It is on the forum though, people have a # next to their ubuntu name
2009-05-31T20:37:00.000Z	zortec		So like I might be ubuntu user #20105
2009-05-31T20:37:00.000Z	zortec		It's a tracking system.  I just wanted to find out if I can get on it.
2009-05-31T20:37:00.000Z	zortec		ziro: Ah, thanks. :)
2009-05-31T20:38:00.000Z	zortec		The download is almost complete.  I want to make sure this is the right ISO: ubuntu-9.04-desktop-i386.iso
2009-05-31T20:40:00.000Z	zortec		Is it normal in this IRC room to get random PMs from users?
2009-05-31T20:40:00.000Z	coz_	zortec	  no it shouldnt be
2009-05-31T20:41:00.000Z	coz_	zortec	  if they are anoying you can tell them here in the public channel to stop
2009-05-31T20:41:00.000Z	coz_	zortec	 ontop of which  PMs  are ok but more information and more input comes about in the public channels
2009-11-26T21:22:00.000Z	coz_	zortec	 it depends on the speed of your internet connetion  and partially your hard drive speeds as well
2009-11-26T21:23:00.000Z	coz_	zortec	  but  a clean install will take about 15 minutes or so ...after having downloaded  the cd
2009-11-26T21:25:00.000Z	coz_	zortec	well do eliminat  any possible  buggie behavior ,, I would clean install
2009-11-26T21:26:00.000Z	coz_	zortec	  I see no advantage of grub2  at this point
2009-11-26T21:26:00.000Z	coz_	zortec	  I prefer pidgin  althouh I really dont use  and chat clients
2009-11-26T21:37:00.000Z	coz_	zortec	 you are on 9.04 right now?
2009-11-26T21:37:00.000Z	zortec	coz_	yes
2009-11-26T21:38:00.000Z	zortec	coz_	oh wait if you mean have I logged into 9.04? not yet
2009-11-26T21:38:00.000Z	coz_	zortec	 well I have 9.10 installed... I fond nothing particularly special about grub2   and the boot sequence in 9.10 karmic is sluggish at best...once in the system it is decent  but not perfect...i would  name karmic an experimental release more than anything
2009-11-26T21:39:00.000Z	zortec	coz_	I will stick with 9.04 for now and see what is in store for lucid lynx
2009-11-26T21:40:00.000Z	coz_	zortec	 i would wait until april unless  you have something that needs to be changed on the system with some of the new libraries
