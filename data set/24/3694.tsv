2007-11-15T21:14:00.000Z	cuscus1986		I am having a major headache with gub
2007-11-15T21:14:00.000Z	cuscus1986		*grub
2007-11-15T21:14:00.000Z	cuscus1986		is anyone able to provide any insight
2007-11-15T21:16:00.000Z	Dr_willis	cuscus1986	 give some details to the problem. Grub can be very... interesting to work with. :)
2007-11-15T21:16:00.000Z	cuscus1986		installed vista (for some reason) first and then ubuntu on another partition on the same disk sda. Grub has sda mapped to hd0.
2007-11-15T21:16:00.000Z	cuscus1986		sorry am typing the story
2007-11-15T21:17:00.000Z	cuscus1986		now ubuntu didn't autodetect vista and we have been playing around with menu.lst trying to get it to boot
2007-11-15T21:17:00.000Z	cuscus1986		ran fdisk -l and the vista partition is definately still there
2007-11-15T21:17:00.000Z	Dr_willis	cuscus1986	 so vista is on sda1?
2007-11-15T21:17:00.000Z	cuscus1986		sda5
2007-11-15T21:17:00.000Z	cuscus1986		we tried hd0,4
2007-11-15T21:18:00.000Z	Dr_willis	cuscus1986	 you actually installed vista to sda5 then when it installed eh? you dident 'move' vista some how to  a new spot?
2007-11-15T21:18:00.000Z	cuscus1986	Dr_willis	I don't believe so we just installed it on a partition leaving space for ubuntu
2007-11-15T21:19:00.000Z	Dr_willis	cuscus1986	 Well some of the older versions of windows did NOT like getting installed to partitions other then the first one. Not sure if vista has the same issues or not.
2007-11-15T21:20:00.000Z	Dr_willis		Im still wondering how it let itself get installed to sda5 :)
2007-11-15T21:20:00.000Z	cuscus1986	Dr_willis	it should have been on the first partition as it was a fresh install and we did it first before ubuntu
2007-11-15T21:21:00.000Z	cuscus1986		right I have the exact error message from grub now
2007-11-15T21:21:00.000Z	Dr_willis	cuscus1986	 yea. somthing seems odd here. I imagine this is a laptop? or is it a desktop box?
2007-11-15T21:21:00.000Z	cuscus1986		laptop
2007-11-15T21:22:00.000Z	cuscus1986		a world of pain
2007-11-15T21:22:00.000Z	cuscus1986		trying to help someone over msn ><
2007-11-15T21:22:00.000Z	Dr_willis	cuscus1986	 was this an actual vista install disk you used? or a specilized laptop 'recovery' type install disk?
2007-11-15T21:24:00.000Z	cuscus1986	Dr_willis	the install route was a fresh install of xp sp2 (not a recovery disk) then a vista upgrade
