2006-01-12T17:59:00.000Z	cafuego	Caius	Yep, there is.
2006-01-12T06:00:00.000Z	cafuego	Caius	sudo $EDITOR /etc/init.d/hwclock.sh
2006-01-12T06:00:00.000Z	Caius	cafuego	its still hung on setting the clock on bootup atm :(
2006-01-12T06:00:00.000Z	cafuego	Caius	Under "HWCLOCKPARS" insert "exit 0" on a line by itself, without quotes.
2006-01-12T06:03:00.000Z	Caius	cafuego	its still stuck there :(
2006-01-12T06:03:00.000Z	cafuego	Caius	ctrl-c it
2006-01-12T06:03:00.000Z	Caius	cafuego	no effect
2006-01-12T06:04:00.000Z	cafuego	Caius	ctrl-\ ?
2006-01-12T06:04:00.000Z	Caius	cafuego	rebooted it, waiting for it to hang now
2006-01-12T06:05:00.000Z	Caius	cafuego	nope
2006-01-12T06:05:00.000Z	cafuego	Caius	boot it with 'init=/bin/bash' as params to the kernel.
2006-01-12T06:05:00.000Z	Caius	cafuego	pardon?
2006-01-12T06:05:00.000Z	cafuego	Caius	That'll teach it!
2006-01-12T06:05:00.000Z	cafuego	Caius	When you get the yaboot prompt, 'Linux init=/bin/bash'
2006-01-12T06:05:00.000Z	Caius	cafuego	OK
2006-01-12T06:05:00.000Z	cafuego	Caius	Yeah, that'll make it run a shell instead of the init scripts.
2006-01-12T06:06:00.000Z	Caius	cafuego	I'm at home in bash :)
2006-01-12T06:06:00.000Z	cafuego	Caius	Now edit /etc/init.d/hwclock.sh
2006-01-12T06:07:00.000Z	cafuego	Caius	just insert 'exit 0' at the top of the file, that'll make it just exit,.
2006-01-12T06:07:00.000Z	Caius	cafuego	k
2006-01-12T06:12:00.000Z	Caius	cafuego	just says "can't open file for writing: read only file system"
