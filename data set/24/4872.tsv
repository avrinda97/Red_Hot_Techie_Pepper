2007-06-24T06:51:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak		oh that i don't know about.
2007-06-24T06:51:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak		it shouldn't mess with Ubuntu config files, no.
2007-06-24T06:52:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak		xcdroast, never could get that to work.. gnomebaker r0x0rz.. ;)
2007-06-24T06:53:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak		you'll need nautilus with root access to delete them
2007-06-24T06:54:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak		!ntfs
2007-06-24T06:56:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak		then try to find ./trash
2007-06-24T06:56:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak		gksudo should work also.
2007-06-24T06:57:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak		it should be in /home
2007-06-24T06:57:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak		!bluetooth
2007-06-24T06:57:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak		sudo reboot?..lol, never heard of that one
2007-06-24T06:57:00.000Z	lgc	IndyGunFreak	lemme check...
2007-12-10T00:42:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	lgc	whats your problem w/ the panel applets
2007-12-10T00:45:00.000Z	lgc	IndyGunFreak	I have two, actually: one is that after the reinstall I can't get the CPU frequency control to let me switch modes (from "powersave" to "performance", for example). I know there's a way to reconfigure it with dpkg. Do you happen to know it?
2007-12-10T00:45:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	lgc	no
2007-12-10T00:45:00.000Z	lgc	IndyGunFreak	the second one is with the dictoinary applet. It just won't let me type in anything.
2007-12-10T00:45:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	lgc	i've had that same problem on my PC..., but it works fine on my laptop.. not sure what the issue is.
2007-12-10T00:46:00.000Z	lgc	IndyGunFreak	hmm... how does one file a bug report?
2007-12-10T00:46:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	lgc	 i don't know.
2007-12-10T00:47:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	lgc	but regardless, you should prbably leave bug reports to experienced users.
2007-12-10T00:48:00.000Z	lgc	IndyGunFreak	is "launchpad" what you mean? (Ompaul, thanks.)
2007-12-10T00:48:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	lgc	yes, i know what launchpad is, but i didn't recommend it to you.
2007-12-10T00:49:00.000Z	lgc	IndyGunFreak	so what do you have in mind?
2007-12-10T00:49:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	lgc	nothing.
2007-12-10T00:49:00.000Z	lgc	IndyGunFreak	oh thanks.
