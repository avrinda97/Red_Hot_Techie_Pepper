2012-03-06T16:11:00.000Z	ryannathans		I need a res of 5760x1080
2012-03-06T16:11:00.000Z	ryannathans		I have three monitors, before installing the drivers I had my desktop across all three

2012-03-06T17:20:00.000Z	ryannathans	crizzy	oh boy... ccsm. I'm scared.
2012-03-06T17:20:00.000Z	crizzy	ryannathans	hehe.. be careful with it. only do those tasks
2012-03-06T17:25:00.000Z	ryannathans	crizzy	that happened to me too. Except with the application 'mumble'
2012-03-06T17:25:00.000Z	ryannathans	crizzy	do i need to reboot after the compiz?

2012-03-06T17:44:00.000Z	crizzy	ryannathans	http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu_Oneiric_Installation_Guide#Create_.deb_packages.
2012-03-06T17:45:00.000Z	crizzy	ryannathans	basically just download, chmod the file, run buildpkg, install debs, initial config, and reboot
2012-03-06T17:47:00.000Z	ryannathans	crizzy	the 11.9 is installed
2012-03-06T17:48:00.000Z	crizzy	ryannathans	just install on top of old debs, works
2012-03-06T17:49:00.000Z	ryannathans	crizzy	the installer is complaining the old one isn't uninstalled
2012-03-06T17:50:00.000Z	crizzy	ryannathans	build the debs, don't run the installer itself
2012-03-06T17:51:00.000Z	crizzy	ryannathans	then dpkg -i *deb
2012-03-06T17:53:00.000Z	ryannathans	crizzy	it says it generated it and put it in the current dir, it didn't
2012-03-06T17:54:00.000Z	crizzy	ryannathans	you might be missing the required tools then: http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu_Oneiric_Installation_Guide#Before_you_start
