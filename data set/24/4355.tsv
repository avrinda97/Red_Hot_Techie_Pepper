2007-12-16T13:06:00.000Z	Gnea		heh
2007-12-16T13:06:00.000Z	Gnea		yeah, that flash plugin is broke right now
2007-12-16T13:06:00.000Z	Gnea		i just wanna make sure his X got setup right
2007-12-16T13:07:00.000Z	nickrud	Gnea	it's supposedly fixed, it's not in the topic and !flashissue is empty now
2007-12-28T10:25:00.000Z	nickrud	Gnea	that just depends on xserver-xorg
2007-12-28T10:25:00.000Z	Gnea	nickrud	not the point.
2007-12-28T12:21:00.000Z	nickrud	Gnea	a really silly question, but do you have java enabled in the prefs?
2007-12-28T12:21:00.000Z	Gnea	nickrud	ha, i hadn't checked yet - doing now
2007-12-28T12:23:00.000Z	Gnea	nickrud	yup, it's already checked
2007-12-28T12:31:00.000Z	Gnea	nickrud	this is driving me nuts! i've done this before on other systems, and yet, i cannot get java to work in a web browser on this newly installed system.
2007-12-28T12:31:00.000Z	nickrud	Gnea	I've always had no problems with java, so never had to trouble shoot it
2008-07-16T04:44:00.000Z	Gnea	nickrud	we are discussing how ubuntu operates, it's hardly off-topic.
2008-07-16T04:45:00.000Z	nickrud	Gnea	it's offtopic regarding support. I'm looking for you all in there ;)
2008-07-16T04:45:00.000Z	Gnea	nickrud	educating users to these facts is, in fact, supportive. ;)
2008-07-16T04:45:00.000Z	nickrud	Gnea	it'll turn into a debate soon, that's why I'm trying to head it off
2008-07-16T04:46:00.000Z	Gnea	nickrud	i just want to make sure that we're in agreement here. the only debate will be what sort of PSU we all use, which, yes, I agree, that should be taken to the other channel.
2008-08-03T08:14:00.000Z	Gnea	nickrud	i still remember when it took 2-4 years for debian to make a full release
2008-08-03T08:14:00.000Z	nickrud	Gnea	I don't think they ever released the whole time I used unstable
2008-08-06T08:35:00.000Z	Gnea	nickrud	that'd be asking for trouble. ;)
2008-08-06T08:35:00.000Z	nickrud	Gnea	my conscience is clean ;)
2008-08-06T08:36:00.000Z	Gnea	nickrud	just don't turn into the crazy german kid
2008-08-11T09:54:00.000Z	Gnea	nickrud	:)
2008-08-11T09:54:00.000Z	nickrud	Gnea	lean more towards screaming mostly ;)
2008-08-11T09:55:00.000Z	Gnea	nickrud	now you know what i like to do when irrationality sets in ;)
