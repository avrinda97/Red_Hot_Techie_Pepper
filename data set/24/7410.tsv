2004-12-26T16:09:00.000Z	earthen		"swat: Depends: samba (= 3.0.7-1ubuntu6) but 3.0.7-1ubuntu6.2 is to be installed"
2004-12-26T16:09:00.000Z	earthen		doh!
2004-12-26T16:09:00.000Z	earthen		how can i fix it
2004-12-26T16:10:00.000Z	farruinn	earthen	do you use multiple repositories?
2004-12-26T16:16:00.000Z	farruinn	earthen	try running sudo apt-get clean
2004-12-26T16:16:00.000Z	farruinn	earthen	then enable universe for swat
2004-12-26T16:21:00.000Z	farruinn	earthen	run an apt-ge update for your changes to take effect then try again
2004-12-26T16:23:00.000Z	earthen	farruinn	i still get the same error
2004-12-26T16:23:00.000Z	farruinn	earthen	warty or hoary?
2004-12-26T16:24:00.000Z	farruinn	earthen	that's what I would suggest. remove samba then install swat
2004-12-26T16:26:00.000Z	farruinn	earthen	see if you can `apt-get install swat=3.0.7-1'
2004-12-26T16:28:00.000Z	farruinn	earthen	aha, I know
2004-12-26T16:29:00.000Z	farruinn	earthen	in your /etc/apt/sources.list add universe to the deb http://security.ubuntu.com... line and the deb-src line below that
2004-12-26T16:30:00.000Z	farruinn	earthen	then sudo apt-get update again of course
2004-12-26T16:34:00.000Z	farruinn	earthen	without the ... of course
2004-12-26T16:36:00.000Z	farruinn	earthen	yeah
2004-12-26T16:37:00.000Z	earthen	farruinn	thank you it seems to be updating it now
2004-12-26T16:38:00.000Z	farruinn	earthen	yay! =)
2004-12-26T16:38:00.000Z	farruinn	earthen	I was having a similar problem with some other package and didn't realize that there were security updates in universe
2004-12-26T16:39:00.000Z	farruinn	earthen	cool, get ready to learn a lot =)
2004-12-26T16:41:00.000Z	farruinn	earthen	heheh, probably a good idea
2004-12-26T16:41:00.000Z	farruinn	earthen	when I was in high school they put linux on a couple of computers to sort of see how people liked it
2005-02-19T14:28:00.000Z	farruinn	earthen	apt-get upgrade but if you mena get ff 1.0 you're options aren't great
