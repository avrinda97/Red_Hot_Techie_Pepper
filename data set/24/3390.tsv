2008-06-11T23:44:00.000Z	sagredo		Hi, I tried to install the ATI Display drivers for Hardy and it clearly is not functioning correctly. How can I revert to alsa?
2008-06-11T23:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sagredo	alsa == sound. ati == graphics
2008-06-11T23:45:00.000Z	sagredo	ActionParsnip	joaopinto then how do I switch to default drivers?
2008-06-11T23:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sagredo	copy back your xorg.conf file from the one you backed up, or simply put vesa instead of fglx (or whatever it is) in your xorg.conf
2008-06-11T23:47:00.000Z	sagredo	ActionParsnip	vesa, that's right
2008-06-11T23:47:00.000Z	sagredo	ActionParsnip	Thanks
2008-08-24T21:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sagredo	have you forwarded the port to you web server machine?
2008-08-24T21:06:00.000Z	sagredo	ActionParsnip	Yep.
2008-08-24T21:06:00.000Z	sagredo	ActionParsnip	I'm pretty sure
2008-08-24T21:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sagredo	id check, thats all that neds setting up. Id set the webserver to static IP
2008-08-24T21:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sagredo	as it may get a different ip on reboot
2008-08-24T21:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sagredo	try powering the router off and on
2008-08-24T21:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sagredo	and verify your wan ip
2008-08-24T21:07:00.000Z	sagredo	ActionParsnip	When I get on the LAN I can accesss it
2008-08-24T21:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sagredo	check your router config dude, if you can conect on lan then its setup fine
2008-08-24T21:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sagredo	maybe it is only accepting connections from the LAN
2008-08-24T21:10:00.000Z	sagredo	ActionParsnip	apache2: Could not reliably determine the server's fully qualified domain name, using 127.0.1.1 for ServerName
2008-08-24T21:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sagredo	you may need to check in /etc/resolv.conf
2008-08-24T21:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sagredo	make sure your own servername is in there and resolving to 127.0.0.1
2008-08-24T21:12:00.000Z	sagredo	ActionParsnip	Okay
2008-08-24T21:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sagredo	as well as your own localhost IP
2012-08-11T23:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sagredo	compiz has the scale plugin
2012-08-11T23:50:00.000Z	sagredo	ActionParsnip	i just did it by accident
2012-08-11T23:50:00.000Z	sagredo	ActionParsnip	there certainly is a way
