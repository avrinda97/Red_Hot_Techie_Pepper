2010-04-21T05:34:00.000Z	tripelb	Typos_King	thanks
2010-06-02T04:16:00.000Z	Typos_King	tripelb	  this is for an .iso file listing?
2010-06-02T04:17:00.000Z	tripelb	Typos_King	yes. the window comes from archive manager.
2010-06-02T04:17:00.000Z	Typos_King	tripelb	  doesn't your archive manager has an option for that?
2010-06-02T04:18:00.000Z	tripelb	Typos_King	maybe I should look at the menu. I'm thinking windows does not allow...
2010-06-02T04:18:00.000Z	Typos_King	tripelb	  I don't think is OS dependent, so much as app dependent
2010-06-02T04:19:00.000Z	tripelb	Typos_King	No. It doesnt. Can you do it from Nautilus?
2010-06-02T04:20:00.000Z	Typos_King	tripelb	  I don't use nautilus... ahem
2010-06-02T04:21:00.000Z	Typos_King	tripelb	  so, how is the listing going to help you with the burning?
2010-06-02T04:23:00.000Z	tripelb	Typos_King	the listing will help me communicate to someone else who can help me cut down the size of the whole. (It has ponyo, in 2 kinds of dolby, 2 kinds of subtitles or none, and in Japanese or dubbed in Chinese. I am sure I can lose some of it. Or else chop it to a smaller avi. Tho I have no clue on how to do that. -- YET)
2010-06-02T04:24:00.000Z	Typos_King	tripelb	  so, is a movie?
2010-06-02T04:25:00.000Z	tripelb	Typos_King	yes. I luckily copied it to a HD _before_ I stepped on it and trashed the disk.
2010-06-02T04:25:00.000Z	Typos_King	tripelb	  sounds to me you just need a good movie editor or ripper for that
2010-06-02T04:26:00.000Z	tripelb	Typos_King	meanwhile it is on a WUBI partition that I can only get to by booting from this partition. If I can create some free filespace on another drive I will free it.
2010-06-02T04:26:00.000Z	tripelb	Typos_King	is there an opensource ubuntu program for that?
2010-06-02T04:27:00.000Z	Typos_King	tripelb	  I've ripped dvds, with k9copy, which allows skipping subtitles and other audios and chapters, but haven't done it from a file, just from a dvd media, however it does have the option to use a file for ripping
2010-06-02T04:28:00.000Z	tripelb	Typos_King	oh yes there are.
2010-06-02T04:28:00.000Z	tripelb	Typos_King	thanks all. I can look at the file names and that is an accomplishment. I am on my way.
2010-06-02T04:30:00.000Z	Typos_King	tripelb	  btw, I was poking around with my archiver, Peazip, it does have a way to get the listing
2010-06-02T04:31:00.000Z	tripelb	Typos_King	still here. I save the good advice in a text file.
2010-06-02T04:32:00.000Z	tripelb	Typos_King	I will look at peazip. that's all I need. and thanks for your time, attention.
2010-06-02T04:41:00.000Z	tripelb	Typos_King	wanting to install peazip -- sudo apt-get install peazip cant find the program. I see the webpage but nothing has ever installed for me except from terminal. there are 2 linux choices on the page. ????
2010-06-02T04:44:00.000Z	Typos_King	tripelb	  in case you missed ubottu's line, you can just mount the .iso and list it from there -> sudo mount -o loop MYFILE.iso  /mnt; cd /mnt; ls -R * > ~/LISTING.txt; less ~/LISTING.txt; umount /mnt;       :)
2010-06-02T04:44:00.000Z	Typos_King	tripelb	  but peazip is in the repositories, that much I know
