2007-07-20T08:48:00.000Z	ethan		hey.
2007-07-20T08:49:00.000Z	ethan		I'm having trouble getting the downloaded nvidia driver (from nvidia.org) working.  I keep getting an API missmatch error when starting X (nvidia driver version doesn't match Xorg kernel version).  I've tried the 100.14 drivers and the 9639 drivers, I get the api missmatch error with each.  (The xorg kernel module compiles fine!)  What do you think ;] ?
2007-07-20T08:50:00.000Z	ethan		the nvidia kernel module compiles fine rather
2007-07-20T08:50:00.000Z	Marfi	ethan	did you enable restricted drivers?
2007-07-20T08:51:00.000Z	ethan	Marfi	?
2007-07-20T08:51:00.000Z	Marfi	ethan	which version of ubuntu?
2007-07-20T08:51:00.000Z	Marfi	ethan	go to system > admin > restricted drivers, and you can enable nvidia drivers there. =)
2007-07-20T08:51:00.000Z	ethan	Marfi	I don't have X...
2007-07-20T08:51:00.000Z	ethan	Marfi	I've been using nvidia glx drivers for new.
2007-07-20T08:53:00.000Z	Marfi	ethan	its usually bad practice to compile drivers when working with ubuntu, especially when a new kernel comes out. =)
2007-07-20T08:54:00.000Z	ethan	Marfi	that doesn't make much sense.
2007-07-20T08:55:00.000Z	Marfi	ethan	when working with gentoo, i had the same problem with the mismatch error. i had to backgrade my kernel, then recompile the drivers for it. with ubuntu, you can just enable the restricted driver modules, which work with the kernel very nicely
2007-07-20T08:56:00.000Z	ethan	Marfi	I have restricted modules enabled...
2007-07-20T08:56:00.000Z	ethan	Marfi	I have the linux-restricted-modules package installed, X has always worked fine
2007-07-20T08:57:00.000Z	Marfi	ethan	what does your xorg.conf look like?
2007-07-20T08:57:00.000Z	ethan	Marfi	I kept my computer off for a week, but when I booted, nvidia-glx didn't work (missmatch error).  It turns out the packagers messed with stuff, and you need to install nvidia-glx-new to get Xorg working, but now I'm getting X freezes, (every 5 seconds with compiz).
2007-07-20T08:57:00.000Z	ethan	Marfi	I've tried the default xorg.conf, and my xorg.conf, and nvidia-settigns xorg.conf.  it's not xorg.conf.
2007-07-20T08:58:00.000Z	Marfi	ethan	did you run an update before starthing compiz?
2007-07-20T08:59:00.000Z	ethan	Marfi	of course
2007-07-20T09:00:00.000Z	Marfi	ethan	when first setting compiz for the card, did you add any lines to the xorg.conf file?
2007-07-20T09:02:00.000Z	ethan	Marfi	of course.
2007-07-20T09:02:00.000Z	ethan	Marfi	I know my way around xorg.conf, that's not the problem here.
2007-07-20T09:02:00.000Z	ethan	Marfi	the nvidia drivers and xorg have gotten out of sync, and I don't know what to do .
2007-07-20T09:07:00.000Z	Marfi	ethan	what is the error that your getting? api mismatch?
