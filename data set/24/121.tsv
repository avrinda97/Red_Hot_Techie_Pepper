2012-06-15T14:41:00.000Z	bvad	meet	go here: https://extensions.gnome.org/ then find "remove accessibilty"
2012-06-15T14:42:00.000Z	bvad		there should be sort of an enable button on the webpage, enable it, and it should go away
2012-06-15T14:42:00.000Z	bvad		Gnome is a bit odd when it comes to the indicator applets
2012-06-15T14:42:00.000Z	meet		does this site now work in chrome?
2012-06-15T14:42:00.000Z	bvad		It should

2012-06-15T14:44:00.000Z	meet	bvad	btw the other extensions which i had installed through this site earlier in 11.10 are now all showing an outdate icon before them.. what does that mean?
2012-06-15T14:44:00.000Z	bvad		The extensions are not compatible with the new unity used in 12.04\
2012-06-15T14:45:00.000Z	bvad		i mean gnome :)
