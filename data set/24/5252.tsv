2006-09-08T14:09:00.000Z	magnet		hehe :)
2006-09-08T14:10:00.000Z	magnet		(if you have any of the *ubuntu-desktop packages)
2006-09-08T14:12:00.000Z	thomas	magnet	sorry :S
2006-09-08T14:12:00.000Z	magnet	thomas	for? :)
2006-09-08T14:19:00.000Z	thomas	magnet	i have been trying to expand my root partition. I have adjoining freespace I want to take advantage of. Should I use the livecd, mount both partitions, and use gparted?
2006-09-08T14:20:00.000Z	magnet	thomas	you shouldn't try to expand your partition :)
2006-09-08T14:20:00.000Z	magnet	thomas	you can't just "expand it"
2006-09-08T14:20:00.000Z	thomas	magnet	even if I copy it's contents into a tar file, use the livecd to delete the root partition and create a larger root partition?
2006-09-08T14:21:00.000Z	magnet	thomas	that you can do, but it's not "extanding", it's copying elsewhere and creating a new partition :)
2006-09-08T14:21:00.000Z	magnet	thomas	tar files take some time, you may try to use cp -ar
2006-09-08T14:21:00.000Z	thomas	magnet	i know, but I don't see any other way.
2006-09-08T14:22:00.000Z	magnet	thomas	this is indeed the only way. the best way is to think of partitionn sizes at the install stage ;)
2006-09-08T14:22:00.000Z	thomas	magnet	I could copy the whole tree to another drive, minus the drive's mountpoint. I have the room... would that work?
2006-09-08T14:22:00.000Z	magnet	thomas	yes
2006-09-08T14:22:00.000Z	thomas	magnet	i had a very small windows installation set up just in case for down the road... that was before I discovered vmware player.
2006-09-08T14:23:00.000Z	magnet	thomas	but you should create a new / part, mount your old / to say /oldroot , mount the partition you want to copy the data to on /backup, and then cp -ar /oldroot/ /backup
2006-09-08T14:24:00.000Z	magnet	thomas	or else the recursive goodness of cp may cause some problems :)
2006-09-08T14:24:00.000Z	magnet	thomas	(the same goes with tar)
2006-09-08T14:24:00.000Z	thomas	magnet	i could use a partition magic livecd i have.
2006-09-08T14:24:00.000Z	thomas	magnet	i just remembered having it.
2006-09-08T14:24:00.000Z	magnet	thomas	that's a solution, if you trust pqmagic :)
2006-09-08T14:25:00.000Z	thomas	magnet	they haven't screwed me yet.
2006-09-08T14:25:00.000Z	thomas	magnet	and I would still be copying the root to another drive just in case.
2006-09-08T14:26:00.000Z	magnet	thomas	well you've understood the basics, so go for it anyway ;)
