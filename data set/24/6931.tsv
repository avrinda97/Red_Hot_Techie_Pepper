2006-06-24T13:18:00.000Z	katie		hi can someone help me make an audio disk from mp3?  i just updated to dapper and it states:  the plugin to handle audio/mpeg is not installed but it plays fine on xmms
2006-06-24T13:19:00.000Z	crimsun_	katie	install gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly
2006-06-24T13:19:00.000Z	katie		thanks crimsun_ :)
2006-06-24T13:22:00.000Z	katie	crimsun_	i install that package and i get the same error
2006-06-24T13:22:00.000Z	crimsun_	katie	with what app?
2006-06-24T13:23:00.000Z	katie	crimsun_	gnomebaker
2006-06-24T13:23:00.000Z	crimsun_	katie	gnomebaker needs the older gstreamer0.8-mad
2006-06-24T13:23:00.000Z	katie	crimsun_	 oh...i have k3b too
2006-06-24T13:23:00.000Z	katie	crimsun_	 what app would you recommend to do it?
2006-06-24T13:23:00.000Z	crimsun_	katie	and k3b would need libk3b2-mp3
2006-06-24T13:24:00.000Z	crimsun_	katie	I normally use Serpentine.
2006-06-24T13:24:00.000Z	crimsun_	katie	should be installed by default in Applications> Sound & Video>
2006-06-24T13:24:00.000Z	katie	crimsun_	 yep, and it appears to work
2006-06-24T13:25:00.000Z	katie	crimsun_	 i have nero linux, k3b, and gnomebaker
2006-06-24T13:25:00.000Z	katie	crimsun_	 couldnt get any of them to work :)
2006-06-24T13:26:00.000Z	crimsun_	katie	none of them work after installing the aforementioned packages?
2006-06-24T13:26:00.000Z	katie	crimsun_	serpentine works
2006-06-24T13:27:00.000Z	crimsun_	katie	did you install gstreamer0.8-mad and libk3b2-mp3?
2006-06-24T13:28:00.000Z	crimsun_	katie	installing those two additional packages should allow you to burn mp3s "directly" in both gnomebaker and k3b
2006-06-24T13:30:00.000Z	katie	crimsun_	 cool thanks itraries? works :)  how do you keep track of all those lib
2006-06-24T13:30:00.000Z	crimsun_	katie	developers should know "something"
2006-06-24T13:30:00.000Z	katie	crimsun_	 cool thanks it works :)  how do you keep track of all those lib
2006-06-24T13:30:00.000Z	katie	crimsun_	 i guess so :)
2006-06-24T13:32:00.000Z	katie	crimsun_	 my roomate is very thankful, she give you a kiss...thanks for being a developer!
