2010-05-26T21:29:00.000Z	imthenachoman		what is the point of disabling root ?
2010-05-26T21:29:00.000Z	jrib	imthenachoman	just not necessary
2010-05-26T21:30:00.000Z	jrib	imthenachoman	(and it's not "disabled", the account is just locked)
2010-05-26T21:30:00.000Z	jrib	imthenachoman	sure, but that's not a reason not to lock the root account :)
2010-05-26T21:31:00.000Z	imthenachoman	jrib	i know that, but i am saying, if someone figures out the password for an ID that can run sudo, then they can become root with sudo -i and do what they want, logging asside
2010-05-26T21:31:00.000Z	jrib	imthenachoman	yes, but that's the same scenario as if they discover the password for root
2010-05-26T21:32:00.000Z	imthenachoman	jrib	yeah, so it comes down to disabling root so idiots who dont know what they are doing cant break anything...right?
2010-05-26T21:32:00.000Z	jrib	imthenachoman	no, since as you just said you can do anything root can do using sudo...
2010-05-26T21:33:00.000Z	jrib	imthenachoman	I imagine part of the rationale was to discourage people from logging in as root and staying that way.  If you don't like it, feel free to enable it of course.  It's completely unecessary, but it's your computer in the end
2010-05-26T21:34:00.000Z	jrib	imthenachoman	a new *what*?
2010-05-26T21:34:00.000Z	imthenachoman	jrib	a new howto
2010-05-26T21:35:00.000Z	jrib	imthenachoman	just type out the new url in your browser, hit enter.  Then remember to link it from somewhere
2010-05-26T21:36:00.000Z	imthenachoman	jrib	oh, ty
2010-06-05T07:32:00.000Z	jrib	imthenachoman	I don't think windows knows anything about ssh by default...  Why do you want to use ssh?
2010-06-05T07:32:00.000Z	imthenachoman	jrib	well anyway i suppose
2010-06-05T07:33:00.000Z	jrib	imthenachoman	you want to mount drives on another machine in your network?
2010-06-05T07:33:00.000Z	imthenachoman	jrib	yes, mount linux drives on xp
2010-06-05T07:33:00.000Z	jrib	imthenachoman	use samba
2010-06-05T07:34:00.000Z	jrib	imthenachoman	you can just right click -> properties -> share (that's samba)
2010-06-05T07:34:00.000Z	imthenachoman	jrib	this is server ubuntu, no x
2010-06-05T07:34:00.000Z	jrib	imthenachoman	you said on your network though so presumably that's not an issue?
2010-06-05T07:46:00.000Z	imthenachoman	jrib	no they are not sir
2010-06-05T07:47:00.000Z	jrib	imthenachoman	ok (that's not what you said earlier)
2010-06-05T08:03:00.000Z	jrib	imthenachoman	you mean nohup?  That's fine too.  Or you could just disown the job before logging out
