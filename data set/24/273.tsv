2012-01-09T15:19:00.000Z	cigue		So recapitulating: My network manager says I'm connected, yet I don't get answers to pings anywhere except localhost. I tried pinging both 8.8.8.8 and my original nameserver. Thoughts?
2012-01-09T15:19:00.000Z	airtonix	cigue	did you try : sudo service Network-Manager restart ?
2012-01-09T15:20:00.000Z	airtonix	cigue	might be in lower case.
2012-01-09T15:20:00.000Z	airtonix	cigue	or sudo killall nm-applet
2012-01-09T15:21:00.000Z	airtonix	cigue	or sudo service networking restart
2012-01-09T15:22:00.000Z	cigue	airtonix	restarted successfully using service restart, no change though.
2012-01-09T15:22:00.000Z	airtonix	cigue	this is 11.10 desktop i assume ?
2012-01-09T15:24:00.000Z	airtonix	cigue	i assume you've ensured that you have a valid network connection profile active in the network manager applet?
2012-01-09T15:24:00.000Z	airtonix	cigue	does sudo ifconfig reveal an interface with an IP address?
2012-01-09T15:26:00.000Z	cigue	airtonix	it does. Supposedly I'm connected, too.
2012-01-09T15:27:00.000Z	airtonix	cigue	what is the output of routes?
2012-01-09T15:27:00.000Z	cigue	airtonix	exact same thing as on my laptop with working wireless
2012-01-09T15:28:00.000Z	airtonix	cigue	and the wirless access point is the intended gateway for your desktop too?
2012-01-09T15:29:00.000Z	airtonix	cigue	ok i assumed you were using wired. what does iwconfig reveal?
2012-01-09T15:32:00.000Z	cigue	airtonix	no sizeable difference in output from iwconfig between my working and failing connection
2012-01-09T15:33:00.000Z	cigue	airtonix	by the way thanks for the help
2012-01-09T15:38:00.000Z	cigue	airtonix	if I have the same iwconfig as a healthy connection, can I check anything else?
2012-01-09T15:39:00.000Z	airtonix	cigue	i would check if it can see access points : sudo iwlist wlan0 scan (where wlan0 is the interface for the wifi)
2012-01-09T15:40:00.000Z	cigue	airtonix	I can.
2012-01-09T15:42:00.000Z	airtonix	cigue	are you using two wifi devices? are they embedded? or are they/it just a wifi usb dongle that you are using between your two computers?
2012-01-09T15:42:00.000Z	airtonix	cigue	in other words: could it be a faulty device?
2012-01-09T15:43:00.000Z	airtonix	cigue	ifnot is the signal between client and accesspoint strong?
2012-01-09T15:43:00.000Z	cigue	airtonix	both computers are running on integrated wireless cards that are supposed to be supported by the kernel version.
2012-01-09T15:44:00.000Z	airtonix	cigue	i'm out of ideas
