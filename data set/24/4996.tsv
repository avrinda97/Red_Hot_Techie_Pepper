2007-07-05T16:41:00.000Z	bobbob1016		My mute button isn't muting.  It shows the mute symbol or the unmute symbol, but doesn't actually mute.  Any ideas?
2007-07-05T16:42:00.000Z	Slart	bobbob1016	mine doesn't mute either.. just sets the volume really low
2008-02-15T04:44:00.000Z	Slart	bobbob1016	I would put 2 GB or so
2008-02-15T04:44:00.000Z	Slart	bobbob1016	not even sure you
2008-02-15T04:45:00.000Z	Slart	bobbob1016	yes
2008-12-22T20:06:00.000Z	Slart	bobbob1016	symbolic links might work nicely.. ln is the command
2008-12-22T20:06:00.000Z	Slart	bobbob1016	man ln for more info
2008-12-22T20:07:00.000Z	bobbob1016	Slart	I tried ln -s with nothing, but I wasn't sure if it was just me, so long as you think it'll work, I'll keep looking.
2008-12-22T20:07:00.000Z	Slart	bobbob1016	man ln ... read it, there are parameters
2008-12-22T20:44:00.000Z	bobbob1016	Slart	I've been google-ing, and reading the man pages, I can't seem to get that working.  I did "ln -s TARGET" as the manpage has for the second form, to link TARGET to the current directory, and it isn't working.
2008-12-22T20:44:00.000Z	Slart	bobbob1016	you want the first form.. ln TARGET LINK_NAME
2008-12-22T20:45:00.000Z	Slart	bobbob1016	so to make a link to another folder you'd use ln -s thelinkname /some/other/folder/or/file
2008-12-22T20:47:00.000Z	Slart	bobbob1016	you're welcome
2009-07-19T21:12:00.000Z	Slart	bobbob1016	I'm pretty sure that you've got it wrong
2009-07-19T21:08:00.000Z	Slart	bobbob1016	don't symlinks always need a base copy of the file? but hard links just remain until the last hard link is removed?
2009-07-19T21:09:00.000Z	Slart	bobbob1016	I would say hard links make more sense unless there is an obvious way of knowing where the original file is located
2009-07-19T21:09:00.000Z	bobbob1016	Slart	Yes, but hard links duplicate size.  I'd want to keep the same locations, just only use 1 bit of space.
2009-07-19T21:09:00.000Z	Slart	bobbob1016	sure about that?
2009-07-19T21:10:00.000Z	bobbob1016	Slart	I don't mean "1 bit" i mean one 1x space not 2x or 3x.
2009-07-19T21:10:00.000Z	Slart	bobbob1016	"hard links duplicat size", are you sure?
2009-07-19T21:12:00.000Z	bobbob1016	Slart	Pretty sure
2009-07-19T21:12:00.000Z	bobbob1016	Slart	Although google-ing is giving me mixed answers
2009-07-19T21:18:00.000Z	bobbob1016	Slart	No big deal, I found a selection thing, I don;t need the duplicates, so I deleted them.  Thanks though.
2009-07-19T21:18:00.000Z	Slart	bobbob1016	you're welcome
