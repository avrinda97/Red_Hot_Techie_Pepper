2008-07-31T12:09:00.000Z	Flannel	chalcedony	Do you know your router is doing DHCP?  Try setting up a static IP address, that might fix it
2008-07-31T12:15:00.000Z	Flannel	chalcedony	do you see yourself with an IP address when you sudo ifconfig?
2008-08-29T01:41:00.000Z	chalcedony	Flannel	or anyone:  on ubuntu hardy, my yahoo mail does not access the address book.. i have to type the addresses in manually,  what do i need to do to fix it?
