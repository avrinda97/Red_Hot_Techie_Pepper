2011-08-23T12:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kinglet	did you MD5 test the ISO you downloaded?
2011-08-23T12:16:00.000Z	kinglet	ActionParsnip	this is the original DVD and I doesnt download it!
2011-08-23T12:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kinglet	ok, did you check the CD for defects when it starts to boot?
2011-08-23T12:17:00.000Z	kinglet	ActionParsnip	no! what should I do?
2011-08-23T12:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kinglet	when the CD starts to boot, press SPACE and select "Check disk for defects"
2011-08-23T12:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kinglet	also from the same screen also run the memtest
2011-08-23T12:18:00.000Z	kinglet	ActionParsnip	ok, I try it and I'll say u everything happends
2011-08-23T12:39:00.000Z	kinglet	ActionParsnip	iceroot_ back! Memory test result http://pastebin.com/0ifnuUXx , check disk for defects have same error I said when I want to install in Graphical mode or Live
2011-08-23T12:39:00.000Z	kinglet	ActionParsnip	I think iceroot_ right! Ubuntu cannot detect my hardwares! :(
2011-08-23T12:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kinglet	could try installing in text mode
2011-08-23T12:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kinglet	could also try failsafe bios settings
2011-08-23T12:41:00.000Z	kinglet	ActionParsnip	I said, text mode after configuring keyboard shows an error "Installation CD-ROM couldn't be mounted"
2011-08-23T12:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kinglet	could try minimal ISO, needs a web connection to work (use a wired link is waaay easier)
2011-08-23T12:42:00.000Z	kinglet	ActionParsnip	what is failsafe settings?
2011-08-23T12:43:00.000Z	kinglet	ActionParsnip	I cann't because my connection is not wired and I have shared connection :(
2011-08-23T12:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kinglet	it will be an option in the BIOS, to load settings which turn off a lot of the nice features of the system but will more than likely work
2011-08-23T12:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kinglet	could also try installing via USB
2011-08-23T12:47:00.000Z	kinglet	ActionParsnip	Yes, you are right. I will try via USB
2011-08-23T12:54:00.000Z	kinglet	ActionParsnip	I have burned DVD (not iso) , and CD iso with incorrect md5sum! should I try CD iso to create USB installer?
2011-08-23T12:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kinglet	the DVD ISO is still an ISO
2011-08-23T12:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kinglet	if you'd MD5 tested the ISO you wouldn't have all this mess ;)
2011-08-23T12:55:00.000Z	kinglet	ActionParsnip	I know! but I have the original DVD and have not iso file! my connection is low speed so I cannot download it and maybe after download the same problem (md5sum incorrect I mean)
2011-08-23T12:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kinglet	torrents help to check for errors, you can also gate the speed of the download in most clients
2011-08-23T12:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kinglet	it will also allow you to pause the download
