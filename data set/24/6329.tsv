2006-03-26T07:14:00.000Z	Nogimics		Can anyone help me with a Gtk-WARNING **: cannot open display: error when trying to run a program calleed nessus with either sudo or gksudo please?
2006-03-26T07:16:00.000Z	sipior	Nogimics	if you su to root, does it work directly?
2006-03-26T07:16:00.000Z	Nogimics	sipior	I dont know will try now
2006-03-26T07:18:00.000Z	Nogimics	sipior	no it doesnt work
2006-03-26T07:18:00.000Z	sipior	Nogimics	same error then?
2006-03-26T07:20:00.000Z	sipior	Nogimics	can you log into X as root, and then try? i think the X server is not permitting connections from other users, hence the problem
2006-03-26T07:20:00.000Z	sipior	Nogimics	at the login screen, try "root" as username
2006-03-26T07:21:00.000Z	Nogimics	sipior	I SSH into my box
2006-03-26T07:21:00.000Z	sipior	Nogimics	you're not directly connected?
2006-03-26T07:21:00.000Z	Nogimics	sipior	I can use VNC and try, but I would have to enable root again
2006-03-26T07:22:00.000Z	sipior	Nogimics	no, that's your problem, you have to enable SSH forwarding -- your gtk app can't connect to a local server
2006-03-26T07:22:00.000Z	sipior	Nogimics	try logging in with ssh -X "hostname"
2006-03-26T07:22:00.000Z	sipior	Nogimics	note that the remote host will need ssh forwarding enabled in its sshd_config file for this to work
2006-03-26T07:23:00.000Z	sipior	Nogimics	that's all right. you're not sitting directly at the machine on which nessus is running, right?
2006-03-26T07:24:00.000Z	Nogimics	sipior	correct as no Monitor is hooked up to it, my ubuntu box is next to me and I SSH into it
2006-03-26T07:24:00.000Z	sipior	Nogimics	right, try logging in with ssh -X, instead of just ssh
2006-03-26T07:25:00.000Z	sipior	Nogimics	hmm...thought you were logging in from a unix box...in this case you'll have to be running an X server on your wnidows machine if you want to use X apps from your unix box
2006-03-26T07:26:00.000Z	sipior	Nogimics	you might find it helpful to install cygwin, which I believe includes an X server by default
2006-03-26T07:28:00.000Z	sipior	Nogimics	should work, but you'll need to figure out how to forward an X connection to it
2006-03-26T07:28:00.000Z	sipior	Nogimics	try the documentation, it must be there
2006-03-26T07:30:00.000Z	Nogimics	sipior	I just logged in via NX Client for Windows and opened a terminal window on the desktop and typped just nessus and a nessus setup window opened.
2006-03-26T07:31:00.000Z	sipior	Nogimics	that's encouraging! :)
