2008-02-15T20:14:00.000Z	ubuntunut		I'd really like to give back to the community, but all I have is basic (very very basic) java understanding. I kinda doubt I'm knowledgable enough to do package management. Where should I fit in?
2008-02-15T20:15:00.000Z	Bodsda	ubuntunut	how-to's?
2008-02-15T20:16:00.000Z	Bodsda	ubuntunut	not needed,.just use install --> and use entire disk
2008-02-15T20:16:00.000Z	ubuntunut	Bodsda	'Twas my second suggestion :)
2008-02-15T20:17:00.000Z	Bodsda	ubuntunut	ye sorry,.,.didnt et there in time ;~)
2008-02-15T20:17:00.000Z	ubuntunut	Bodsda	Heh. Now question: What do you mean by how-tos?
2008-02-15T20:17:00.000Z	ubuntunut	Bodsda	It's kinda hard to pick a how to that hasn't been written yet. A BUTT ton of things have already been documented on ubuntu-forums
2008-02-15T20:17:00.000Z	Bodsda	ubuntunut	write specific step-by-step documentation on how to do something
2008-02-15T20:18:00.000Z	Bodsda	ubuntunut	or how about art?
2008-02-15T20:19:00.000Z	ubuntunut	Bodsda	I know when I see something's ascetically pleasing. That's about as far as my art-savyness goes :)
2008-02-15T20:20:00.000Z	Bodsda	ubuntunut	give me feedback ,.,.lol,.,. http://s258.photobucket.com/albums/hh275/Bodsda/
2008-02-15T20:23:00.000Z	ubuntunut	Bodsda	Hehe, psychadelic(h). :). I'm not a huge fan of lense flares as my background. That would look nice as a splash screen (the ubuntu ones). The tux ones are interesting, too :)
2008-02-15T20:23:00.000Z	Bodsda	ubuntunut	lad you like 'em :~),.,. so have you decided how to "ive back" ?
2008-02-15T20:24:00.000Z	ubuntunut	Bodsda	I'm still not sure. I can always clown around in the IRC room. But I dunno.'
2008-02-15T20:24:00.000Z	Bodsda	ubuntunut	thats what i do,. im thinking of ding some more art, but im not really that interested in it,.,;~)
2008-02-15T20:25:00.000Z	ubuntunut	Bodsda	Hehe.
2008-02-15T20:25:00.000Z	ubuntunut	Bodsda	When I gain a better understanding of networking stuff, then I think I'll really be able to contribute.
2008-02-15T20:25:00.000Z	Bodsda	ubuntunut	im learning python,.,.can you programme?
2008-02-15T20:26:00.000Z	Bodsda	ubuntunut	networkin is only 1 thing in a long line of problems people have on a daily bases
2008-02-15T20:26:00.000Z	ubuntunut	Bodsda	I'm learning Java in a uni class right now for info sci. So I can *kinda* program
2008-02-15T20:26:00.000Z	Bodsda	ubuntunut	why not write some java things,. like an ubuntu themed game or summit,.,.lol
2008-02-15T20:32:00.000Z	ubuntunut	Bodsda	Why doesn't ubuntu emulate 5.1 sound like windows does?
2008-02-15T20:33:00.000Z	Bodsda	ubuntunut	because it doesnt want to be assosciated with windows
2008-02-15T20:35:00.000Z	ubuntunut	Bodsda	when I attempt to play something in 5.1 sound (Like off a dvd), I get choppy sound and a "broken pipe" error in the console. Any idea what that's about?
