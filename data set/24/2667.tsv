2009-03-24T15:29:00.000Z	adi1	zeroday	| i did metacity --replace
2009-03-24T15:29:00.000Z	zeroday	adi1	and then tried to play a video?
2009-03-24T15:30:00.000Z	zeroday	adi1	err were you running emerald or something?
2009-03-24T15:30:00.000Z	zeroday	adi1	okay, basically when you have compiz or desktop effects enabled you can't play video
2009-03-24T15:31:00.000Z	zeroday	adi1	due to a bug in the open source ati driver, in jaunty this is fixed
2009-03-24T15:32:00.000Z	zeroday	adi1	well you can't have cause after we did metacity --replace video worked :)
2009-03-24T15:32:00.000Z	zeroday	adi1	and all that did was replace whatever was running with metacity
2009-03-24T15:32:00.000Z	zeroday	adi1	that is your choice whether to upgrade or not, however stuff(s) might break
2009-03-24T15:33:00.000Z	zeroday	adi1	no, you are running compiz currently. Every time you want to watch a video you need to switch to metacity
2009-03-24T15:34:00.000Z	zeroday	adi1	you can do this easily with the fusion-icon app
2009-03-24T15:34:00.000Z	zeroday	adi1	install that package, an icon will appear in your notification area, left clicking will allow you to quickly switch between compiz and metacity
2009-03-24T15:35:00.000Z	zeroday	adi1	can you pastebin the output of ps aux | grep compiz please
2009-03-24T15:36:00.000Z	zeroday	adi1	and currently you won't be able to play video?
2009-03-24T15:37:00.000Z	zeroday	adi1	it is a driver issue, its a driver bug :)
2009-03-24T15:38:00.000Z	zeroday	adi1	can you play video currently?
2009-03-24T15:38:00.000Z	zeroday	adi1	and after doing metacity --replace can you play video?
2009-03-24T15:39:00.000Z	zeroday	adi1	can you take a screenshot please?
2009-03-24T15:41:00.000Z	zeroday	adi1	okay, you lose window border. Metacity --replace should bring them back up. Can you try a jaunty livecd and see if the issue is still there?
2009-03-24T15:41:00.000Z	zeroday	adi1	?
2009-03-24T15:42:00.000Z	zeroday	adi1	great
2009-03-24T15:42:00.000Z	zeroday	adi1	and you still have window borders?
2009-03-24T15:42:00.000Z	zeroday	adi1	its because you aren't running compiz.
2009-03-24T15:43:00.000Z	zeroday	adi1	(hint: this all works in jaunty)
2009-03-24T15:43:00.000Z	zeroday	adi1	gnome-do won't work if you don't have desktop effects. Ever.
