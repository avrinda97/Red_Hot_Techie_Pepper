2008-11-14T00:08:00.000Z	NekroJakub		S0F4LNX: I can tell you what I know, it seems to be tied in with Compiz, it's true that I changed around some settings but I didn't touch show desktop, in fact both the show desktop plugins are off and were off at the time.
2008-11-14T00:09:00.000Z	NekroJakub		S0F4LNX: What do you mean, the show desktop applet? It's in the bottom-left corner in GNOME by default.
2008-11-14T00:09:00.000Z	gammy	NekroJakub	It's probably a daft key conflict don't you think?
2008-11-14T00:10:00.000Z	NekroJakub	gammy	It seems like a feature, I mean I saw show desktop work like that in KDE I think, but before it just minimised always
2008-11-14T00:10:00.000Z	gammy	NekroJakub	Just yesterday I had it deadlock on me because I enabled the magnifier plugin at the same time as the advanced magnifier plugin :
2008-11-14T00:11:00.000Z	NekroJakub	gammy	So how does your show desktop button work?
2008-11-14T00:11:00.000Z	gammy	NekroJakub	I'm not too sure what you were talking about earlier, but may I recommend you get the compizconfig-settings-manager package.
2008-11-14T00:11:00.000Z	gammy	NekroJakub	I don't have one I'm afrain.
2008-11-14T00:11:00.000Z	gammy	NekroJakub	Er, afraid.
2008-11-14T00:11:00.000Z	NekroJakub	gammy	I got that package already, I'll double-check to make sure.
2008-11-14T00:12:00.000Z	gammy	NekroJakub	Ah
2008-11-14T00:12:00.000Z	NekroJakub	gammy	Yeah, I have it.
2008-11-14T00:13:00.000Z	gammy	NekroJakub	I just re-read your post while trying my newly added desktop button thinger.
2008-11-14T00:13:00.000Z	gammy	NekroJakub	So the problem is what - that it toggles between min/max instead of always mimimizing?
2008-11-14T00:13:00.000Z	NekroJakub	gammy	Exactly. It always minimised before.
2008-11-14T00:14:00.000Z	gammy	NekroJakub	Ok. It seems nice as it is to me. I wonder - how do you maximize them again then?
2008-11-14T00:14:00.000Z	NekroJakub	gammy	By clicking the button again. But I don't want that... *sigh* And I do swear it didn't do that before.
2008-11-14T00:14:00.000Z	gammy	NekroJakub	No I mean, how did you do it *before* :)
2008-11-14T00:16:00.000Z	NekroJakub	gammy	Before my desktop showed every time I clicked. All windows minimised.
2008-11-14T00:16:00.000Z	NekroJakub	gammy	If I opened one and clicked the button, it'd minimise just show the desktop again.
2008-11-14T00:16:00.000Z	gammy	NekroJakub	Ok. Well I see what you're upset about (the fact that there is no option for changing this behavior)
2008-11-14T00:16:00.000Z	NekroJakub		S0F4LNX: I had it from the start, that show desktop button.
2008-11-14T00:17:00.000Z	NekroJakub		S0F4LNX: It's default in GNOME I am sure.
2008-11-14T00:17:00.000Z	NekroJakub	gammy	Yeah, why did it change all of a sudden.
