2005-07-12T16:33:00.000Z	xophEr		Hi! I installed an external eth0 driver, how can I get eth0 to be 'ifupped' automatically?
2005-07-12T07:01:00.000Z	xophEr		I have 1024mb RAM but system monitor only shows 885?
2005-07-12T07:01:00.000Z	bob2	xophEr	install a -686 kernel
2005-07-12T07:02:00.000Z	bob2	xophEr	e.g., install the linux-686 package
2005-07-12T07:08:00.000Z	xophEr	bob2	allright, thanks :)
2005-09-30T13:35:00.000Z	bob2	xophEr	why are you trying to compile your own kernel?
2005-09-30T13:35:00.000Z	xophEr	bob2	because I need something that 2.6.13 has and 2.6.12 doesnt :)
2005-09-30T13:35:00.000Z	bob2	xophEr	which is?
2005-09-30T13:38:00.000Z	bob2	xophEr	I'm quite serious about asking which things are missing, since if 2.6.12 is missing support for your hardware, that should be added to buntu's kernel
2005-09-30T13:41:00.000Z	xophEr	bob2	well my NIC needs the sk98lin driver, "Marvell Yukon Chipset / SysKonnect SK-98xx Support" In kernel config. It's a 1000mb eth card, integrated with my ASUS a8v-e Deluxe m/b.
2005-09-30T13:42:00.000Z	bob2	xophEr	2.6.12 has no driver for that at all?
2005-09-30T13:44:00.000Z	bob2	xophEr	have you filed a bug?
2005-09-30T13:44:00.000Z	xophEr	bob2	not yet
2005-10-14T12:18:00.000Z	bob2	xophEr	you already have it installed
2005-10-14T12:18:00.000Z	bob2	xophEr	do you mean "GTK header files"?
2005-10-14T12:19:00.000Z	xophEr	bob2	well something I need in order to be able to ./configure an application.. it tells me 'checking for GLIB - version >= 2.4.0... no
2005-10-14T12:19:00.000Z	bob2	xophEr	that would have been a better first question for you to ask; install libgtk2.0-dev
2005-10-14T12:20:00.000Z	bob2	xophEr	tho you probably will end needing gnome-devel; what are you compiling?
2005-10-14T13:11:00.000Z	bob2	xophEr	#ubuntu-motu
2005-11-03T11:00:00.000Z	bob2	xophEr	no
2005-11-03T11:01:00.000Z	xophEr	bob2	is there another way of doing this
2005-11-03T11:01:00.000Z	bob2	xophEr	not unless it can use the uid module
2005-11-03T11:01:00.000Z	bob2	xophEr	what are you trying to achieve?
2005-11-03T11:04:00.000Z	bob2	xophEr	no, what program, and why?
