2005-09-25T07:06:00.000Z	linuxN00b		What about starting an IRC server? There any freware IRCd's out there?
2005-09-25T07:08:00.000Z	nalioth	linuxN00b	you may use the hyperion ircd if you wish. you are using it now.
2005-09-25T07:09:00.000Z	linuxN00b	nalioth	I'm on a windows box...
2005-09-25T07:09:00.000Z	nalioth	linuxN00b	cygwin to the rescue
2005-09-25T07:09:00.000Z	nalioth	linuxN00b	switch to linux
2005-09-25T07:09:00.000Z	linuxN00b	nalioth	Heh... I'm only dreaming... I'm dialup-ped.
2005-09-25T07:09:00.000Z	linuxN00b	nalioth	Working on it...
2005-09-25T07:10:00.000Z	nalioth	linuxN00b	irc is the only internet protocol that doesnt require big pipes
2005-09-25T07:10:00.000Z	linuxN00b	nalioth	Whats holding me back is I have a win modem... which means no internet. which means there's veeeeeery little point in running linux for me.
2005-09-25T07:10:00.000Z	linuxN00b	nalioth	Unless you're freenode ;p
2005-09-25T07:10:00.000Z	nalioth	linuxN00b	if you are only using the ircd to 'see how it workd' and only want a few folks on it
2005-09-25T07:11:00.000Z	nalioth	linuxN00b	linux modems are easily acquired
2005-09-25T07:11:00.000Z	linuxN00b	nalioth	I used fuzzball once... ran a small muck for a few days.
2005-09-25T07:13:00.000Z	nalioth	linuxN00b	why would you want to use telnet?
2005-09-25T07:14:00.000Z	linuxN00b	nalioth	go look up fuzzball. It works over the telnet protocall (MUCK)
2005-09-25T07:14:00.000Z	linuxN00b	nalioth	Its that way so windows users can use it too... not just people who have special apps.
2005-09-25T07:16:00.000Z	nalioth	linuxN00b	you've lost me with "windows users" and "special apps"
2005-09-25T07:17:00.000Z	linuxN00b	nalioth	windows has a SSH client?
2005-09-25T07:17:00.000Z	nalioth	linuxN00b	yes there are several SSH clients for windows
2005-09-25T07:17:00.000Z	linuxN00b	nalioth	Thats not pre-installed ;P
2005-09-25T07:17:00.000Z	nalioth	linuxN00b	NOTHING but trouble is preinstalled
2005-09-25T07:19:00.000Z	linuxN00b	nalioth	X3
2005-09-25T07:21:00.000Z	linuxN00b	nalioth	There's a few things I've learned not to discuss... Religion, Politics, and Windows in a Linux Chatroom.
