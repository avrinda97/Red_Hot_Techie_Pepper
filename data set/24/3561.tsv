2008-12-29T16:53:00.000Z	kop		is there a way to DL all the packages for 8.1 ? I'm heading for the land of no internet
2008-12-29T16:53:00.000Z	kop		erm yes all..
2008-12-29T16:53:00.000Z	MenZa	kop	That's a lot of data.
2008-12-29T16:53:00.000Z	kop	MenZa	better a lot than none
2008-12-29T16:54:00.000Z	MenZa	kop	Still, you want to download every single package from the repositories?
2008-12-29T16:54:00.000Z	kop		It would take more than a few min to explain why but yes
2008-12-29T16:56:00.000Z	MenZa	kop	I really don't recommend doing this, but you can do sudo apt-get install * to install them. mind you, this is several gigabytes of data, and not all packages will be useful for you. o_O
2008-12-29T16:56:00.000Z	MenZa	kop	Godspeed if you do.
2008-12-29T16:57:00.000Z	kop	MenZa	that is the crux of the issue I don't need all the pkgs but need to have them availible
2008-12-29T16:57:00.000Z	kop		I just need to dl thewhole thing
2008-12-29T16:58:00.000Z	MenZa	kop	In that case, sudo aptitude download *
2008-12-29T16:58:00.000Z	kop		that easy ?
2008-12-29T16:58:00.000Z	MenZa		yup
2008-12-29T16:58:00.000Z	MenZa		But are you sure you have the room for it?
2008-12-29T16:59:00.000Z	kop	MenZa	this from an old BSD usr that had to deal w/ slo or no internet for months
2008-12-29T16:59:00.000Z	MenZa	kop	still, this is terabytes of data we're talking about
2008-12-29T17:00:00.000Z	kop	MenZa	TB I got connection I don't
2008-12-29T17:00:00.000Z	MenZa		heh
2008-12-29T17:00:00.000Z	MenZa		Good luck with it, kop
2008-12-29T17:02:00.000Z	kop	MenZa	it's this or thumb drive by RFC1149
2008-12-29T17:04:00.000Z	kop	MenZa	I'll save you the search and thanx for the help http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1149.html
2008-12-29T17:13:00.000Z	MenZa	kop	I am well aware of RFC 1149 :)
2008-12-29T17:15:00.000Z	kop	MenZa	more than happy to bring back an old memory but how about something more useful ? http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=352460
2008-12-29T17:15:00.000Z	kop	MenZa	I'm still rtfm atm but I may have answered my own question
