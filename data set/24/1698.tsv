2010-03-08T16:23:00.000Z	airtonix	switchgirl	you may want to stop before you over-react.
2010-03-08T16:23:00.000Z	switchgirl	airtonix	i'm a member o the #ubuntu-women chan - just pointing out that Ubuntu is for All
2010-03-08T16:23:00.000Z	airtonix	switchgirl	please?
2010-03-08T16:23:00.000Z	switchgirl	airtonix	i have issues with the new thunderbird
2010-03-08T16:24:00.000Z	airtonix	switchgirl	describe the problem
2010-03-08T16:24:00.000Z	airtonix	switchgirl	ok i assume you have tried connecting to the mail accounts with other mail clients ?
2010-03-08T16:25:00.000Z	airtonix	switchgirl	if so have you tried resetting thunderbird (temporarily) by moving the thunderbird user config folder elsewhere and trying again with a fresh config setup ?
2010-03-08T16:26:00.000Z	switchgirl	airtonix	i'm using the BETA
2010-03-08T16:28:00.000Z	airtonix	switchgirl	so you've tried both those options? then i would try running thunderbird from terminal so that you get some feedback from the terminal stdout...maybe it gives something to indicate why you can not recieve mail ?
2010-03-08T16:30:00.000Z	airtonix	switchgirl	i also assume you have the old thunderbird around still ? does it work as expected ?
2010-03-08T16:33:00.000Z	switchgirl	airtonix	i'd prefer not to use the old one as its rubbish imho
2010-03-08T16:34:00.000Z	airtonix	switchgirl	up to you really... but since its beta software and you're having issues, one can only come to a two way descision : a) keep using it and help debug the problem with reports to mozilla or b) use the version you know work
2010-03-23T03:35:00.000Z	switchgirl	airtonix	that's out of date
2010-03-23T03:35:00.000Z	airtonix	switchgirl	thank you

2010-03-23T03:38:00.000Z	switchgirl	airtonix	why use a extra plugin - why xmpp works
2010-03-23T03:39:00.000Z	airtonix	switchgirl	no idea, like i said i dont use the plugin nor do i use facebook.
