2012-08-05T00:29:00.000Z	paolooo		hi @all, anyone can help me about my partition http://imm.io/zg9k Is that a correct paritioning?
2012-08-05T00:31:00.000Z	ThinkT510	paolooo	it works but i don't know why you would want them that big
2012-08-05T00:32:00.000Z	paolooo	ThinkT510	thanks for the reply. That's my HD size. I'm planning to partition it, d: and e:
2012-08-05T00:33:00.000Z	ThinkT510	paolooo	do you need a 200+gb root partition?
2012-08-05T00:35:00.000Z	paolooo	ThinkT510	hehehe, I'm new to ubuntu os, that's why I don't if I have correct partitioning. Can you please give an advice. Thank you.
2012-08-05T00:36:00.000Z	ThinkT510	paolooo	how many OS's are you going to have on the disk?
2012-08-05T00:36:00.000Z	paolooo	ThinkT510	just ubuntu
2012-08-05T00:36:00.000Z	ThinkT510	paolooo	any reason you have a swap partition inside an extended?
2012-08-05T00:37:00.000Z	paolooo	ThinkT510	no, I just followed the installation tutorial in youtube.
2012-08-05T00:37:00.000Z	ThinkT510	paolooo	well it must be a bad tutorial if it suggests that layout
2012-08-05T00:38:00.000Z	paolooo	ThinkT510	wew, yeah! she said it should be the twice of my RAM.
2012-08-05T00:39:00.000Z	ThinkT510	paolooo	thats not the issue, why is it in an extended partition?
2012-08-05T00:40:00.000Z	paolooo	ThinkT510	I'm not really sure. :(
2012-08-05T00:40:00.000Z	paolooo	ThinkT510	Should delete it?
2012-08-05T00:41:00.000Z	ThinkT510	paolooo	its doing no harm, it just doesn't make any sense
2012-08-05T00:42:00.000Z	paolooo	ThinkT510	ah I see, but I can remove it in the future right? using gparted?
2012-08-05T00:43:00.000Z	ThinkT510	paolooo	you'd need to recreate the swap partition afterward but yeah
2012-08-05T00:43:00.000Z	paolooo	ThinkT510	ah ok
2012-08-05T00:44:00.000Z	paolooo	ThinkT510	so what do you suggest now? Should I delete it? /sda1 and /sda5
2012-08-05T00:45:00.000Z	ThinkT510	paolooo	up to you
2012-08-05T00:45:00.000Z	paolooo	ThinkT510	but I just can't. delete option is disabled.
2012-08-05T00:46:00.000Z	ThinkT510	paolooo	you have to delete the partition inside first
2012-08-05T00:46:00.000Z	ThinkT510	paolooo	to do that you need to swapoff if it is in use
2012-08-05T00:48:00.000Z	paolooo	ThinkT510	yes, I just deleted the partition: http://imm.io/zgrt
