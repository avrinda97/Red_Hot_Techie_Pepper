2005-07-15T14:03:00.000Z	Krypt|c		Gnome is pretty good, although there are some kick butt kde apps as well.
2005-07-15T14:03:00.000Z	Krypt|c		I used to be a windowmaker monkey when I was using debian
2005-07-15T14:04:00.000Z	Krypt|c		I'm not terribly loyal to any desktop manager... as long as it works, I can install any needed apps
2005-07-15T14:05:00.000Z	Krypt|c		ie, there's no reason why you couldn't install a KDE application and continue to use GNOME, or vice versa
2005-07-15T14:06:00.000Z	Krypt|c		Now if only they'd release the updated version of Nicotine...
2005-07-15T14:06:00.000Z	Krypt|c		That'd make me happy.
2005-07-15T14:06:00.000Z	Krypt|c		The current version is broken to windows soulseek client
2005-07-15T14:06:00.000Z	Krypt|c		or rather, the current version in Ubuntu
2005-07-15T14:07:00.000Z	Krypt|c		it's currently using 1.0.8rc1, and the current release is 1.0.8
