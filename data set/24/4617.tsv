2007-05-03T06:35:00.000Z	reubs		I have a problem with an ssh server daemon. I think it is a router/network issue is there some one that can point me in the right direction to find out how to deal with it?
2007-05-03T06:36:00.000Z	soundray	reubs	describe the signs and symptoms please
2007-05-03T06:38:00.000Z	reubs	soundray	well, i have turned off UseDNS in ssh, but when i try and ssh into my ubuntu machine from my mac ( from my own network ) i have to wait about a minute and a half before i get a password prompt.
2007-05-03T06:39:00.000Z	soundray	reubs	you should add an /etc/hosts entry on ubuntu for your mac.
2007-05-03T06:42:00.000Z	soundray	reubs	pretty certain it will work. Agree about the router.
2007-05-03T06:45:00.000Z	reubs	soundray	kairu0: hasn't seemed to make any difference
2007-05-03T06:46:00.000Z	soundray	reubs	Just booting my own mac to try
2007-05-03T06:49:00.000Z	reubs	soundray	I think it might have to do with my router combined with ubuntu, it's a dlink, i can ssh into the mac instantly. but trying to get into the ubuntu box, just takes a long time :( and unfortunatly it's my main box
2007-05-03T06:49:00.000Z	soundray	reubs	strange, I get no delay at all even without a hosts entry. Consider running ssh with debugging info.
2007-05-03T06:50:00.000Z	soundray	reubs	ssh -v
2007-05-03T06:50:00.000Z	reubs	soundray	oh i didn't even know there was one, i will look it up, ah thanks I don't even have to look it up, you are the man
2007-05-03T06:55:00.000Z	reubs	soundray	i have the error. :D which means i'm alot closer to solving it
2007-05-03T06:58:00.000Z	reubs	soundray	sorry just getting used to the ubuntu way of copying between consoles :) it was: An invalid realm for numeric host was supplied /n malform parm [sic]  /n cannot determine relm for numeric host address /n validation errer
2007-05-03T07:04:00.000Z	reubs	soundray	? is the name i stick in the hosts file, next to the ip important? or can it be anything, i.e. does it have to be exactly the same as the comp name/ network name of the mac?
2007-05-03T07:05:00.000Z	soundray	reubs	it doesn't matter
2007-05-03T07:06:00.000Z	reubs	soundray	just what i thougt. any idea what the 'Cannot determine realm for numeric host address' would relate to ?
2007-05-03T07:08:00.000Z	soundray	reubs	no. Try throwing it at a web search engine?
2007-05-03T07:10:00.000Z	reubs	soundray	would the shh channel throw me out for asking such a noob question if i went in and asked it ? :)
2007-05-03T07:10:00.000Z	soundray	reubs	don't know, never been there. Read the topic, spend some time lurking, and then see if you want to take the risk ;)
2007-05-03T07:13:00.000Z	reubs	soundray	thanks for all of you help. Please accept my thanks :D
2007-05-03T07:13:00.000Z	soundray	reubs	glad I could assist
2007-05-13T07:15:00.000Z	soundray	reubs	it's probably poorly supported by your hardware.
2007-05-13T07:17:00.000Z	reubs	soundray	is there a away to narrow down which bit it is?
2007-05-13T07:18:00.000Z	soundray	reubs	you could reverse-compile your DSDT with iasl and check for compile errors.
