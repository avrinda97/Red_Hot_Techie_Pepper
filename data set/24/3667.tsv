2007-11-22T10:11:00.000Z	bradv	newguy	Don't panic about your data. You can always create another install of Linux and mount your existing drive.
2007-11-22T10:12:00.000Z	newguy	bradv	sorry you mean install over the already installed OS?
2007-11-22T10:12:00.000Z	bradv	newguy	No you can install on another partition. Focus on fixing the problem at hand, but don't panic about your data - there's no need.
2007-11-22T10:13:00.000Z	newguy	bradv	ah ok, well could i please get some help im really in it deep

2007-11-22T10:14:00.000Z	bradv	newguy	I saw the post. Unfortunately I don't think I can help you, as I have never used ndiswrapper.
2007-11-22T10:14:00.000Z	newguy	bradv	so even if i install ubuntu on a partition, i still lose my data right?
2007-11-22T10:14:00.000Z	newguy	bradv	so even if i install ubuntu on a partition, i mean i have to reinstall every to get my OS to how it was before
2007-11-22T10:14:00.000Z	bradv	newguy	No you will not. As long as you don't overwrite your existing partition, you will be fine.
2007-11-22T10:14:00.000Z	newguy	bradv	the conky, the banshee, the themes everything?
