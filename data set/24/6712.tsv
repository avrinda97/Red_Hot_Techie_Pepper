2005-08-29T13:40:00.000Z	knowledge		but I could be wrong
2005-08-29T13:42:00.000Z	knowledge		question...I have a hard drive with OS X installed on it (6 gig partition) and the drive is a 60 gig, how can I move my current linux install onto that without any sort of problems?
2005-08-29T13:42:00.000Z	nalioth	knowledge	depends on your current linux distro
2005-08-29T13:42:00.000Z	knowledge	nalioth	Ubuntu
2005-08-29T13:43:00.000Z	nalioth	knowledge	better to install from scratch ubuntu on the hd, and just move your HOMEDIR over
2005-08-29T13:43:00.000Z	knowledge	nalioth	I could definitely do that
2005-08-29T13:43:00.000Z	nalioth	knowledge	what kind of mac?
2005-08-29T13:43:00.000Z	knowledge	nalioth	Dell Inspiron 8200
2005-08-29T13:44:00.000Z	nalioth	knowledge	i'm very confused, but thats a common constant with me
2005-08-29T13:44:00.000Z	knowledge	nalioth	it's the osX86 version of os x
2005-08-29T13:44:00.000Z	nalioth	knowledge	just install ubuntu of whatever flavor on it, and it should be no prob
2005-08-29T13:45:00.000Z	knowledge	nalioth	yeah, I know what you mean...honestly even though I got it to run clean, it still doesn't seem like a mac, you know what I mean?
2005-08-29T13:46:00.000Z	nalioth	knowledge	i'm sure the macs that have intel inside are gonna be tweaked to their last squeak
2005-08-29T13:47:00.000Z	knowledge	nalioth	I'm sure, but I thought it was cool that macs had a processor that was unique, and from what I understand...the PPC arch was a MUCH better design, but then again, I'm not a programmer so I can't care that much
2005-08-29T13:48:00.000Z	nalioth	knowledge	politics is the decision maker in the switch
2005-08-29T13:50:00.000Z	knowledge	nalioth	agreed, in the end, it's money and politics
2005-08-29T13:52:00.000Z	nalioth	knowledge	another OS (you mean like linux?)
2005-08-29T13:52:00.000Z	knowledge	nalioth	yeah
2005-08-29T13:53:00.000Z	nalioth	knowledge	i have 2 macs now running ubuntu, and am working on gettin 2 more running ubuntu
2005-08-29T13:53:00.000Z	nalioth	knowledge	i find OSX overrated
2005-08-29T13:54:00.000Z	knowledge	nalioth	yeah, I agree, I was so hyped about using OSX on my own computer, so I could fool around with all the ins and outs...but after about an hour I was like...this is it? I just think the cases looked nice. Also, I don't even know where to begin looking for mobos and processors to build a PPC comp
2005-08-29T13:55:00.000Z	nalioth	knowledge	there are not a lot of PPC mobos other than via apple
2005-08-29T13:55:00.000Z	knowledge	nalioth	exactly...
2005-08-29T13:56:00.000Z	knowledge	nalioth	so even if there are distros and os' that can utilize PPC, there's no longer a point after 2Q '06
