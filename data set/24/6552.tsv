2005-09-25T15:01:00.000Z	lucaas		anyone gnows what i should do?
2005-09-25T15:01:00.000Z	LinuxJones	lucaas	did you re-boot your computer after the upgrade ?
2005-09-25T15:01:00.000Z	lucaas	LinuxJones	i did
2005-09-25T15:02:00.000Z	LinuxJones	lucaas	breezy uses the 2.6.12 kernel and you should have no problems with installing the nvidia drivers
2005-09-25T15:02:00.000Z	LinuxJones	lucaas	did you compile your own kernel ?
2005-09-25T15:02:00.000Z	lucaas	LinuxJones	no, i got one precompiled
2005-09-25T15:02:00.000Z	LinuxJones	lucaas	do uname -r in a terminal window
2005-09-25T15:03:00.000Z	lucaas	LinuxJones	2.6.12-8-386
2005-09-25T15:04:00.000Z	LinuxJones	lucaas	ok now do sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx
2005-09-25T15:04:00.000Z	lucaas	LinuxJones	ok, done
2005-09-25T15:05:00.000Z	LinuxJones	lucaas	perfect now do  sudo nvidia-glx-config
2005-09-25T15:06:00.000Z	lucaas	LinuxJones	it tells me that my x configuration is altered and that it cannot proceed automatically
2005-09-25T15:06:00.000Z	LinuxJones	lucaas	ok we can do it manually
2005-09-25T15:08:00.000Z	LinuxJones	lucaas	do sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2005-09-25T15:08:00.000Z	LinuxJones	lucaas	yes if your familiar you can change the driver to nvidia and ensure that glx is added to the loadable modules section
2005-09-25T15:09:00.000Z	lucaas	LinuxJones	i have Load   "glx" under Section "module, and driver   "nvidia" under Section "device"
2005-09-25T15:09:00.000Z	lucaas	LinuxJones	i cant use gedit since im in console :>
2005-09-25T15:10:00.000Z	LinuxJones	lucaas	that's ok now type sudo modprobe nvidia, then sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart
2005-09-25T15:16:00.000Z	lucaas	LinuxJones	it still doesnt work :/
2005-09-25T15:18:00.000Z	LinuxJones	lucaas	you were messing around with your xorg config file manually, follow the steps at the top of the file. then sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg follow the prompts, ask if you don't know the answer to any question
2005-09-25T15:22:00.000Z	lucaas	LinuxJones	should i use kernel framebuffer device interface?
2005-09-25T15:25:00.000Z	LinuxJones	lucaas	no
2005-09-25T15:31:00.000Z	lucaas	LinuxJones	it worked now, thank you very much
2005-09-25T15:32:00.000Z	LinuxJones	lucaas	excellent :)
