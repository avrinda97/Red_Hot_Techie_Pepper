2007-04-03T10:37:00.000Z	mindstate		im having some terrible connection issues, not sure why but every couple of days im not able to goto web pages properly, it go's so slow ..this is not a connection issue i've resolved it with my ISP, so i figured it must be something with Ubuntu. Some things i am able to get to fast like IRC and gAIM .. it doesnt crawl or connect slow.. but webpages do.. any help?
2007-04-03T10:38:00.000Z	PhirePhly	mindstate	have you turned off IPv6 yet?
2007-04-03T10:38:00.000Z	mindstate	PhirePhly	im not sure? how do i check
2007-04-03T10:38:00.000Z	mindstate	PhirePhly	if i dont know i guess i didnt lol
2007-04-03T10:38:00.000Z	PhirePhly	mindstate	1 sec, lemme find it
2007-04-03T10:38:00.000Z	mindstate	PhirePhly	ok
2007-04-03T10:39:00.000Z	PhirePhly	mindstate	in firefox, goto the page "about:config" and in the text box at the top type in "network"
2007-04-03T10:39:00.000Z	mindstate	PhirePhly	ok did that
2007-04-03T10:40:00.000Z	PhirePhly	mindstate	then scroll down to network.dns.disableipv6 and double click it to true
2007-04-03T10:40:00.000Z	mindstate	PhirePhly	it is already on true
2007-04-03T10:40:00.000Z	PhirePhly	mindstate	rats
2007-04-03T10:41:00.000Z	mindstate	PhirePhly	no other ideas?
2007-04-03T10:41:00.000Z	PhirePhly	mindstate	two more, but i dunno how much good it'll do if that's already turned off
2007-04-03T10:42:00.000Z	mindstate	PhirePhly	well lets try em lol
2007-04-03T10:42:00.000Z	mindstate	PhirePhly	could it be tmp files cache stuff like that?
2007-04-03T10:44:00.000Z	PhirePhly	mindstate	maybe, but my first idea: system - admin - network  - DNS  and replace with the two ip address for openDNS (it never hurts)  google for those
2007-04-03T10:44:00.000Z	mindstate		hmm PhirePhly , firefox runs fine, but swiftfox does not
2007-04-03T10:44:00.000Z	mindstate	PhirePhly	is that not weird?
2007-04-03T10:44:00.000Z	mindstate		ok
2007-04-03T10:44:00.000Z	PhirePhly	mindstate	haha, odd.  I've never used swiftfox
2007-04-03T10:44:00.000Z	mindstate	PhirePhly	i think i may stop now
2007-04-03T10:44:00.000Z	mindstate		lol
2007-04-03T10:44:00.000Z	mindstate		ill still check out that openDNS PhirePhly
