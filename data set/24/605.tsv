2012-04-22T23:09:00.000Z	Defusal		can anyone tell me what the recommended way to work with cpusets on ubuntu is? according to http://www.bullopensource.org/cpuset/cpuset.html debian has pcreate, pdestroy, pmod, pexec and pls commands, suse has a python util, but ubuntu has nothing... i also need to setup a bootcpuset, which suse has docs for, but ubuntus man pages say stuff like "SEE ALSO bootcpuset.conf(5), bootcpuset(8)",
2012-04-22T23:09:00.000Z	Defusal		yet the links are invalid and no such pages exist
2012-04-22T23:11:00.000Z	Defusal		this is starting to make me seriously regret using ubuntu over debian for my new server, it is as if someone removed these important utilities, docs and related things from ubuntu
2012-04-22T23:11:00.000Z	mrmango	Defusal	yeah debian all the way for servers
2012-04-22T23:11:00.000Z	Defusal		sigh
2012-04-22T23:12:00.000Z	Defusal		well it's too late now, i thought ubuntu server would be like debian server with some extra stuff
2012-04-22T23:12:00.000Z	mrmango	Defusal	I use ubuntu server here at home, but for LAMP stacks I would not
2012-04-22T23:12:00.000Z	Defusal		it seems to be quite the opposite, where ubuntu server is missing core debian utils
2012-04-22T23:13:00.000Z	Defusal	mrmango	i was not aware that ubuntu server had disadvantages compared to debian
2012-04-22T23:13:00.000Z	mrmango		what!
2012-04-22T23:13:00.000Z	mrmango		how big is that text
2012-04-22T23:13:00.000Z	Defusal		but it is too late now, so i have to find a way to get this working
2012-04-22T23:14:00.000Z	mrmango	Defusal	well for some its fine, but I'd use debian in a VM or dedi where possible.
2012-04-22T23:14:00.000Z	Defusal	mrmango	i won't make the mistake again
2012-04-22T23:14:00.000Z	Defusal		but yeah, if only i knew this before
2012-04-22T23:14:00.000Z	Defusal		what the hell did they do with bootcpuset.conf(5), bootcpuset(8)
2012-04-22T23:14:00.000Z	mrmango	Defusal	;) live and learn
2012-04-22T23:14:00.000Z	Defusal		:(
2012-04-22T23:15:00.000Z	mrmango	Defusal	you might see if they are available under a PPA or something. I would assume other would have noticed.
2012-04-22T23:15:00.000Z	Defusal		i have been searching for ages
2012-04-22T23:15:00.000Z	mrmango		doubleAa batteries gives them 100 hours!
2012-04-22T23:16:00.000Z	Defusal		sigh, bankrupcy, here i come
2012-04-22T23:16:00.000Z	mrmango	Defusal	bankruptcy? Because of the wrong distro?
2012-04-22T23:17:00.000Z	Defusal	mrmango	because of a never ending supply of edge case issues causing constant delays on an already terribly late platform launch
