2011-08-07T00:17:00.000Z	yeats	wrtiii	you might investigate clonezilla
2011-08-07T00:13:00.000Z	yeats	wrtiii	try doing 'tasksel' and select LAMP server
2011-08-07T00:15:00.000Z	wrtiii	yeats	Everything I have read pretty much says not to use tasksel?  Is there a program similar to windows ghost that I could use to create a image of my server as it is now in the event that I end up with some ugly installs and want to start fresh again without completing a full install again?
2011-08-07T00:17:00.000Z	yeats	wrtiii	don't know why it's not advisable to use tasksel - it's certainly easier than manual installation and is "tweakable" later
2011-08-07T00:18:00.000Z	yeats	wrtiii	looks like one of the programs you're trying to install requires apache-mpm-worker and another needs apache-mpm-prefork and those can't *both* be installed
2011-08-07T00:21:00.000Z	wrtiii	yeats	tasksel: aptitude failed (100)
2011-08-07T00:22:00.000Z	yeats	wrtiii	may be because you have some conflicting packages installed?
2011-08-07T00:22:00.000Z	wrtiii	yeats	I've only installed OpenSSH
2011-08-07T00:23:00.000Z	yeats	wrtiii	hmm - can you pastebin the full output?
2011-08-07T00:23:00.000Z	wrtiii	yeats	That's all it says.
2011-08-07T00:25:00.000Z	yeats	wrtiii	try 'sudo dpkg --configure -a'
2011-08-07T00:25:00.000Z	wrtiii	yeats	no output shown. immediatly next line was back to prompt
2011-08-07T00:26:00.000Z	yeats	wrtiii	try tasksel again
2011-08-07T00:27:00.000Z	wrtiii	yeats	same error
2011-08-07T00:28:00.000Z	yeats	wrtiii	okay - try 'sudo apt-get update' and see if that works
2011-08-07T00:28:00.000Z	wrtiii	yeats	nice.. uhh  -- W: Failed to fetch http://ca.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/natty-updates/universe/i18n/Translation-en  Cannot initiate the connection to ca.archive.ubuntu.com:80 (91.189.88.31). - connect (101: Network is unreachable) [IP: 91.189.88.31 80]
2011-08-07T00:29:00.000Z	yeats	wrtiii	well that would certainly cause aptitude to fail ;-)
2011-08-07T00:30:00.000Z	wrtiii	yeats	Ok So why is the default installation trying to find something that does not exist?
2011-08-07T00:31:00.000Z	yeats	wrtiii	eh?  I'm seeing "Network is unreachable" which you'd need to fix before aptitude will work
2011-08-07T00:31:00.000Z	wrtiii	yeats	I'm seeing the file it's requesting on the far end not existing?
2011-08-07T00:32:00.000Z	yeats	wrtiii	ah - okay - that probably means the mirror is out of sync - try changing mirrors
2011-08-07T00:32:00.000Z	wrtiii	yeats	What is network unreachable supposed to mean then?
2011-08-07T00:32:00.000Z	yeats	wrtiii	^^
