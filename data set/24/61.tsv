2012-09-11T04:26:00.000Z	daemongpl		full disk encrypt
2012-09-11T04:27:00.000Z	daemongpl		sounds like trying to encrypt an external HD
2012-09-11T04:28:00.000Z	daemongpl		ahahaha that 2
2012-09-11T04:29:00.000Z	daemongpl		bootable encryption installer or bootable OS that is encrypted
2012-09-11T04:30:00.000Z	visioneer	daemongpl	bootable os that is encypted
2012-09-11T04:35:00.000Z	daemongpl	visioneer	I don't have experience with cryptsetup but from google it looks like it only encrypts the drive with no option to make it bootable. So to use that external drive you need an OS that has cryptsetup installed to be prompted for password to open the drive.
2012-09-11T04:36:00.000Z	daemongpl	visioneer	what OS is on the external HD?
2012-09-11T04:36:00.000Z	visioneer	daemongpl	ive created a boot partition for that
2012-09-11T04:37:00.000Z	daemongpl	visioneer	boot partition has to boot some sort of OS with cryptsetup installed to access the drive
2012-09-11T04:37:00.000Z	visioneer		specifically, im following this tut http://www.edwiget.name/2011/11/administration-backtrack-5r1-full-disk-encryption-install-to-hard-drive/
2012-09-11T04:37:00.000Z	daemongpl		you need something that will encrypt the drive and add its own preboot screen without software required
2012-09-11T04:38:00.000Z	visioneer	daemongpl	im not concerned about that because ive done this for a live persistent FDE usb... now cant do it on stupid HDD
2012-09-11T04:39:00.000Z	daemongpl	visioneer	so if its been done... let me ask have you tried to boot up the external OS and encrypt while its running?
2012-09-11T04:41:00.000Z	visioneer	daemongpl	i have to mkfs before i can install the OS
2012-09-11T04:42:00.000Z	visioneer		deamongpl correct?
2012-09-11T04:42:00.000Z	daemongpl	visioneer	so no OS is currently loaded on the external?
2012-09-11T04:42:00.000Z	visioneer	daemongpl	nope. trying to get to that point but no fs yet
2012-09-11T04:43:00.000Z	daemongpl		linux going on external?
2012-09-11T04:45:00.000Z	daemongpl	visioneer	Use the tool --- sudo apt-get install unetbootin
2012-09-11T04:45:00.000Z	visioneer	daemongpl	that doesnt create FDE. does it?
2012-09-11T04:45:00.000Z	daemongpl	visioneer	makes it EZ unless you are trying to learn the commands to do it in terminal
2012-09-11T04:46:00.000Z	daemongpl	visioneer	installs OS to external and makes it bootable... you boot into it then encrypt
2012-09-11T04:46:00.000Z	visioneer	daemongpl	i am doing it in terminal via fdisk and cryptsetup
2012-09-11T04:46:00.000Z	daemongpl	visioneer	you cannot install OS and encrypt at same time... one then the other
