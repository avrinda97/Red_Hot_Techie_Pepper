2011-12-03T19:13:00.000Z	SteMMo		hi there, is it possible to run an update (oneiric) from a usk disk whe i'm on  live (intrepid) ?
2011-12-03T19:13:00.000Z	ikonia	SteMMo	it's not really worth updating the livecd
2011-12-03T19:13:00.000Z	ikonia	SteMMo	unless I've miss understood what you are asking
2011-12-03T19:14:00.000Z	SteMMo		i need to upgrade an old installation to oneiric but i have only the image and the livecd
2011-12-03T19:14:00.000Z	ikonia	SteMMo	ahhh, I seee what you're asking
2011-12-03T19:14:00.000Z	ikonia	SteMMo	what is the old version ?
2011-12-03T19:14:00.000Z	SteMMo		8.10
2011-12-03T19:15:00.000Z	ikonia	SteMMo	I personally would not advise an upgrade like that
2011-12-03T19:15:00.000Z	ikonia	SteMMo	the jump in gnome versions and kernel versions (and therefore associated libraries) would take a long long time and not be the most stable process
2011-12-03T19:15:00.000Z	SteMMo		ok, i can reinstall from the scratch
2011-12-03T19:15:00.000Z	ikonia	SteMMo	that would be my advise yes
2011-12-03T19:16:00.000Z	SteMMo		which image i need to download ?
2011-12-03T19:16:00.000Z	ikonia	SteMMo	which ever one you want
2011-12-03T19:16:00.000Z	SteMMo		but i will need to launch it from a livecd
2011-12-03T19:17:00.000Z	ikonia	SteMMo	yes,
2011-12-03T19:17:00.000Z	SteMMo		but i cannot burn a cd
2011-12-03T19:17:00.000Z	ikonia	SteMMo	you can download the images and use it on an USB stick,
2011-12-03T19:17:00.000Z	ikonia	SteMMo	I personally don't like that process, but it is possible,
2011-12-03T19:17:00.000Z	ikonia		!install
2011-12-03T19:18:00.000Z	SteMMo	ikonia	and boot from the usb stick?
2011-12-03T19:18:00.000Z	ikonia	SteMMo	correct
2011-12-03T19:18:00.000Z	SteMMo	ikonia	i cannot boot from a usb device!
2011-12-03T19:18:00.000Z	ikonia	SteMMo	see the link ubottu just posted
2011-12-03T19:18:00.000Z	ikonia	SteMMo	then you cannot do it
