2008-03-06T19:47:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Strawberryjam	Suggestion..  once you finish, burn them to a cd or dvd .. /var/cache/apt/achives
2008-03-06T19:54:00.000Z	Strawberryjam	Jack_Sparrow	Any ideas everytime i update Alsa i lose my install? i followed the instructions on ALSA website
2008-03-06T19:55:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Strawberryjam	what do you mean by lose your install.
2008-03-06T19:55:00.000Z	Strawberryjam	Jack_Sparrow	not from the term...i meant to say i lose my GUI
2008-03-06T19:56:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Strawberryjam	Let me paste the script I have for recompiling my alsa so we can see if that is how you are doing yours.. one sec..
2008-03-06T20:28:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Strawberryjam	Yea.. sure blame the wife.. np
2008-03-06T20:28:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Strawberryjam	See the link and we can discuss it
2008-03-06T20:31:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Strawberryjam	Lines 72, 74, 76 and 88 do the real work  is that what you have been doing to rebuild your alsa drivers
2008-03-06T20:33:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Strawberryjam	16 wont work
2008-03-06T20:34:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Strawberryjam	You need to use 15 or you have all sorts of problems
2008-03-06T20:34:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Strawberryjam	FYI  #Alsa room has lots of good helpful people
2008-03-06T20:36:00.000Z	Strawberryjam	Jack_Sparrow	its kinda hard now as i am using my wife's machine and running studio off a usb hdd in Vmware. Effortless. its just the hardware is in the other machine.
2008-03-06T20:39:00.000Z	Strawberryjam	Jack_Sparrow	so just incase if i understand line 82 correctly...if i dont know what the correct value for my card is "?" will work?
2008-03-06T20:39:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Strawberryjam	Line 82 is rem'd out and not used in that script
2008-03-06T20:40:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Strawberryjam	I have not finished those options yet the ? means I dont have an answer yet
2008-03-06T20:41:00.000Z	Strawberryjam	Jack_Sparrow	thank you
2008-03-06T21:02:00.000Z	Strawberryjam	Jack_Sparrow	is right pak: VM's use windows resources, it is sharing them
2008-03-12T18:44:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Strawberryjam	Aside from the fact that we dont support studio...  I am working a script now
