2008-04-24T01:38:00.000Z	ikonia	pschorf	LDFLAGS is for linker, sorry, I shold have been clear
2008-04-24T01:34:00.000Z	ikonia	pschorf	CFLAGS LDFLAGS
2008-04-24T01:35:00.000Z	pschorf	ikonia	would i put that in my .bashrc?
2008-04-24T01:35:00.000Z	ikonia	pschorf	if you want
2008-04-24T01:37:00.000Z	pschorf	ikonia	I exported "-g -Wall" to CFLAGS and LDFLAGS, but if i run gcc, it doesn't generate warnings normally triggered by -Wall
2008-04-24T01:38:00.000Z	ikonia	pschorf	CXXFLAGS
2008-04-24T01:39:00.000Z	pschorf	ikonia	so i export to CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS? I'm still not getting the warning.
2008-04-24T01:39:00.000Z	ikonia	pschorf	maybe the code is good
2008-04-24T01:40:00.000Z	ikonia	pschorf	sometimes configure can override them on certain software
2008-04-24T01:40:00.000Z	pschorf	ikonia	if I actually type it in (gcc -g -Wall -o 1-1 1-1.c) it generates the warning...I would like it to run by default because I frequently forget to "return 0"
2008-04-24T01:42:00.000Z	pschorf	ikonia	yes
2008-04-24T01:42:00.000Z	ikonia	pschorf	clear your source tree, re-unpack it (or clear the cache files) and try it, your Makefile is probably overriding it
2008-04-24T01:43:00.000Z	ikonia	pschorf	thats the most common issue, the Makefile is written/updated byt he configure script, or cache files are overiding changes
2008-04-24T01:49:00.000Z	pschorf	ikonia	I forgot to say that i'm not using a makefile, I'm only compiling a source file for a homework assignment and didn't bother
2008-04-24T01:49:00.000Z	ikonia	pschorf	no problem, clear the cache then
2008-04-24T01:50:00.000Z	pschorf	ikonia	how do I do that?
2008-04-24T01:51:00.000Z	pschorf	ikonia	how do I clear the cache?
2008-04-24T02:04:00.000Z	pschorf	ikonia	I've tried restarting my computer, still can't get the gcc to catch the flags
2008-12-29T21:28:00.000Z	ikonia	pschorf	there is no need for that comment to pschorf just drop it
2008-12-29T21:28:00.000Z	ikonia	pschorf	what package are you gdb'ing
2008-12-29T21:28:00.000Z	pschorf	ikonia	it's happening on anything I try...even a hello world program
2008-12-29T21:29:00.000Z	ikonia	pschorf	if you go to #gcc and ask for help / docs understanding gdb output I'm sure they will point you in the right place
2008-12-29T21:31:00.000Z	pschorf	ikonia	I was in #gdb earlier and they sent me back here to see if anyone else had this issue
2008-12-29T21:31:00.000Z	ikonia	pschorf	you need to read up and understand what it is, i/o problems could be something similar to can't write/read memory, or can't write/read disk
