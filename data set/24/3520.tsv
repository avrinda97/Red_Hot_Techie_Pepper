2008-01-10T15:30:00.000Z	zetheroo		anyone?
2008-01-10T15:32:00.000Z	zionpsyfer	zetheroo	There might not be a driver for it.  Does it pop up when you plug it in?  Do you notice anything happen?
2008-01-10T15:32:00.000Z	zetheroo	zionpsyfer	nothing at all
2008-01-10T15:32:00.000Z	zionpsyfer	zetheroo	What is the make/model of the reader?
2008-01-10T15:33:00.000Z	zetheroo	zionpsyfer	how can I tell?

2008-01-10T15:39:00.000Z	zetheroo	zionpsyfer	I forgot to say that the card I am having trouble with is an XD card
2008-01-10T15:44:00.000Z	zionpsyfer	zetheroo	try running 'lshw'  in a terminal and looking for your reader in the list is spews.  We're looking for 'ricoh' that's supposedly the brand. Does it?
2008-01-10T15:45:00.000Z	zetheroo	zionpsyfer	yes its a Ricoh
2008-01-10T15:45:00.000Z	zetheroo	zionpsyfer	yes
2008-01-10T15:46:00.000Z	zetheroo	zionpsyfer	nothing doing....
2008-01-10T15:46:00.000Z	zetheroo	zionpsyfer	I think thats for SD cards
2008-01-10T15:50:00.000Z	zionpsyfer	zetheroo	Looks like some people have had luck
2008-01-10T15:52:00.000Z	zetheroo	zionpsyfer	thanks... but again it seems that people are still having issues with XD cards
2008-01-10T16:04:00.000Z	zionpsyfer	zetheroo	Yeah, that one looks like a no go.  Hopefully they'll have it working soon.
2008-01-10T16:05:00.000Z	zetheroo	zionpsyfer	i am also having trouble adding the GPG key for the Ubuntu screenlets repo
2008-01-10T17:33:00.000Z	zionpsyfer	zetheroo	package is 'python-imaging'
2008-01-10T17:33:00.000Z	zetheroo	zionpsyfer	thanks
