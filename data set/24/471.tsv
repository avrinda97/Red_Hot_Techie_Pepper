2011-08-09T21:12:00.000Z	Pici	ufrgs	search for ttf in the repos, there are a number of them there.
2012-07-17T22:08:00.000Z	Pici	ufrgs	stop that
2012-07-17T22:08:00.000Z	ufrgs	Pici	so help me!!!
2012-07-17T22:08:00.000Z	ufrgs	Pici	will you :)
2012-07-17T22:09:00.000Z	Pici	ufrgs	I don't even know what your issue is, I just see you asking 'why'
2012-07-17T22:09:00.000Z	ufrgs	Pici	well, I am facing huge problems here when I try to figure how is my HDD partioned.
2012-07-17T22:09:00.000Z	ufrgs	Pici	or partitioned, is this a word?
2012-07-17T22:10:00.000Z	Pici	ufrgs	What sort of problems?
2012-07-17T22:10:00.000Z	ufrgs	Pici	well the guy just told me to mention I've used WIBI, which I am not 100% sure either but I think so if my memory can help me this time.
2012-07-17T22:11:00.000Z	Pici	ufrgs	How did you install Ubuntu? Did you boot from the CD or did you start the install from Windows?
2012-07-17T22:11:00.000Z	ufrgs	Pici	I have both Windows and Ubuntu installed at this HDD. And I am starting to feel both systems are HD space short.
2012-07-17T22:11:00.000Z	ufrgs	Pici	if I remeber well I did start installation from Windows.
2012-07-17T22:12:00.000Z	ufrgs	Pici	why is it so important ?
2012-07-17T22:12:00.000Z	Pici	ufrgs	Because installing using WUBI does not partition the harddrive. It creates a file within Windows that it uses as a virtual drive.
2012-07-17T22:13:00.000Z	ufrgs	Pici	ohh... and is it good ?
2012-07-17T22:13:00.000Z	Pici	ufrgs	good? Many power users don't like it because it makes troubleshooting booting issues much harder to diagnose.
2012-07-17T22:14:00.000Z	ufrgs	Pici	ok, and lets say I want to partition my disk now, without loosing Windows. But reinstalling Ubuntu on its free new partition, is it possible?
2012-07-17T22:15:00.000Z	Pici	ufrgs	yes, but if you're having space issues in Windows, you should get those sorted out before continuing.
2012-07-17T22:16:00.000Z	ufrgs	Pici	do you think if I partition the disk now from Linux side, can I loose Windows?
2012-07-17T22:16:00.000Z	Pici	ufrgs	You should have backups before repartitioning.
2012-07-17T22:17:00.000Z	ufrgs	Pici	I have it, how do I do that ?
2012-07-17T22:17:00.000Z	ufrgs	Pici	with fdisk ?
2012-07-17T22:18:00.000Z	Pici	ufrgs	use gparted from the Ubuntu live CD
2012-07-17T22:18:00.000Z	Pici	ufrgs	But again, if you are having low diskspace issues right now, you need to figure those out before you continue.
