2007-01-17T14:12:00.000Z	tiolpxe-		does anyone actually know how to change to runlevel 3 by default using upstart everything im reading is people with the issue but no solutions
2007-01-17T14:13:00.000Z	adaptr	tiolpxe-	the first line in /etc/inittab reads: id:2:init; change the 2 to a 3 and re-init
2007-01-17T14:14:00.000Z	tiolpxe-	adaptr	edgy does not use init it uses upstart
2007-01-17T14:16:00.000Z	adaptr	tiolpxe-	well, I have inittab - are you telling me that that does no longer work ? I *seriously* doubt it.. you have no clue how much that woul dbreak
2007-01-17T14:17:00.000Z	tiolpxe-	adaptr	http://upstart.ubuntu.com/
2007-01-17T14:17:00.000Z	adaptr	tiolpxe-	I am not your "dude" (more like your dad), and I run Edgy Eft, which does include /etc/inittab
2007-01-17T14:18:00.000Z	tiolpxe-	adaptr	well actually there is not
2007-01-17T14:19:00.000Z	adaptr	tiolpxe-	that's not nearly what I meant - and then again, it was
2007-01-17T14:21:00.000Z	adaptr	tiolpxe-	the first thing I read on the upstart web site is that event.d holds the startup jobs
2007-01-17T14:22:00.000Z	adaptr	tiolpxe-	you're telling me you did not get that far ? step 2 would be reading the "rc-default" job that is in that directory
2007-01-17T14:22:00.000Z	adaptr	tiolpxe-	the first line reads: rc-default *guesses what the runlevel should be*
2007-01-17T14:23:00.000Z	adaptr	tiolpxe-	well, you *guess* what it does... it reads the id: from /etc/inittab
2007-01-17T14:23:00.000Z	tiolpxe-	adaptr	it does not read inittab at all
2007-01-17T14:24:00.000Z	adaptr	tiolpxe-	yes, it does - read the file
2007-01-17T14:25:00.000Z	adaptr	tiolpxe-	if there is no value returned from reading inittab then it defaults to 2 - which you can *read in the file*.. sigh. .please go read the file :)
2007-01-17T14:26:00.000Z	adaptr	tiolpxe-	if you want me to provide you with a solution *now*, "echo id:3:initdefault > /etc/inittab"
2007-01-17T14:27:00.000Z	adaptr	tiolpxe-	but - as the upstart docs warn you - that may change at any moment in the future
2007-01-17T14:32:00.000Z	adaptr	tiolpxe-	I'm not bickering.. much; you just go run at level 3 now, dya hear ?
2007-01-17T14:33:00.000Z	adaptr	tiolpxe-	you still here ?
2007-01-17T14:33:00.000Z	tiolpxe-	adaptr	certainly am
2007-01-17T14:34:00.000Z	adaptr	tiolpxe-	open up /etc/event.d/rc-default and change the "2" in the catchall line to a "3" - that will start in runlevel 3 on the next reboot
2007-01-17T14:35:00.000Z	tiolpxe-	adaptr	cheers i'll try that i personally would have looked for a 5 to a 3
2007-01-17T14:35:00.000Z	adaptr	tiolpxe-	debian ( and hence *buntu) has always used level 2 for all multiuser logins - I was used to 5 as well, with Red Hat
2007-01-17T14:36:00.000Z	tiolpxe-	adaptr	 thnx again
