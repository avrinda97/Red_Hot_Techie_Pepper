2007-05-24T06:47:00.000Z	Odysseus		Hey all
2007-05-24T06:47:00.000Z	Odysseus		Just a quick question if anyone has the time to answer
2007-05-24T06:48:00.000Z	Odysseus		I'm running the dreaded ATI (unfortunatly), I have about 20 desktops that I want Ubuntu installed onto, all with ATI X800 cards in them
2007-05-24T06:49:00.000Z	Odysseus		What is the best solution that people have found to use Ubuntu on Desktops with ATI cards
2007-05-24T06:49:00.000Z	Odysseus		ha, I know that
2007-05-24T06:49:00.000Z	Odysseus		ah
2007-05-24T06:50:00.000Z	spikeb	Odysseus	i find that if the open source driver supports the card, using that is the least headache.
2007-05-24T06:50:00.000Z	Odysseus	spikeb	do you mean the one avalible from ATI it self?
2007-05-24T06:50:00.000Z	spikeb	Odysseus	no, the default driver included with X.
2007-05-24T06:51:00.000Z	Odysseus	spikeb	I've got problems with the driver, I need to get at least a 1280 x 1024 resolution for the desktop
2007-05-24T06:52:00.000Z	spikeb	Odysseus	then use the restricted drivers manager to install/manage ATI's driver.
2007-05-24T06:52:00.000Z	Odysseus		spikeb:ok so the restricted driver is the one that comes from ATI?
2007-05-24T06:52:00.000Z	spikeb	Odysseus	yes. but ubuntu has an application that will manage that, no need to mess with ATI's website or anything.
2007-05-24T06:53:00.000Z	Odysseus	spikeb	oh great, what application is it?
2007-05-24T06:53:00.000Z	spikeb	Odysseus	in system->administration, it's called Restricted Drivers Manager
2007-05-24T06:53:00.000Z	Odysseus		What I'm looking at doing with the installs is wrapping it into a LiveCD with the correct driver so that I can install them directly all at the same time
2007-05-24T06:54:00.000Z	spikeb		hrm
2007-05-24T06:54:00.000Z	Odysseus		So my next question is: Is it possible to modify the LiveCD so that it includes the restricted driver?
2007-05-24T06:55:00.000Z	spikeb		hmm
2007-05-24T06:55:00.000Z	spikeb	Odysseus	out of my league, although i know the alternative installer has some OEM options.
2007-05-24T06:56:00.000Z	Odysseus		I was going to go with SlaX but I need packages that come with Ubuntu already installed
2007-05-24T06:56:00.000Z	Odysseus		that and Ubuntu is just a whole heap darn cooler
2007-05-24T06:56:00.000Z	Odysseus		I also want to do a bit of XGL or Beryl on it too
2007-05-24T06:57:00.000Z	spikeb	Odysseus	see if anything here will help you figure something out: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation
