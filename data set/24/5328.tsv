2006-11-27T14:26:00.000Z	Casanova		I had a power cut and now I am not able to boot into X
2006-11-27T14:26:00.000Z	Casanova		the /etc/X11/xorg.conf file is intact
2006-11-27T14:26:00.000Z	Casanova		does any one have any clues?
2006-11-27T14:27:00.000Z	DARKGuy	Casanova	What does /var/log/Xorg.0.log say?
2006-11-27T14:27:00.000Z	Casanova	DARKGuy	1 minute.. let me check
2006-11-27T14:27:00.000Z	DARKGuy	Casanova	use www.pastebin.ca for pasting the log
2006-11-27T14:29:00.000Z	Casanova	DARKGuy	http://prashblog.com/files/Xorg.0.log
2006-11-27T14:29:00.000Z	Casanova	DARKGuy	sorry I am on console now.. so i cant cut and pastebin :(
2006-11-27T14:29:00.000Z	DARKGuy	Casanova	Whoops, forgot about that xD it's okay, let me check ;)
2006-11-27T14:29:00.000Z	Casanova		thanks :)
2006-11-27T14:30:00.000Z	Casanova	DARKGuy	I have a 865 Intel motherboard by the way
2006-11-27T14:31:00.000Z	DARKGuy	Casanova	I see... no errors either - not one of those that say that can't start the X server oO...
2006-11-27T14:32:00.000Z	Casanova	DARKGuy	its really odd.. i mean i couldnt shutdown properly once (due to the power cut) and X stops working :|
2006-11-27T14:33:00.000Z	DARKGuy	Casanova	Weird... what's the Driver parameter in the Device section of your xorg.conf ?
2006-11-27T14:34:00.000Z	DARKGuy	Casanova	I think that maybe using a generic one might give you some X where you can debug the problem?
2006-11-27T14:34:00.000Z	Casanova	DARKGuy	wtf!!! xserver-xorg was gone mysteriously :o
2006-11-27T14:34:00.000Z	DARKGuy	Casanova	wtf oO
2006-11-27T14:34:00.000Z	Casanova	DARKGuy	whew works now :-) I removed xserver-xorg-vmware ... could that be a  reason?
2006-11-27T14:35:00.000Z	Casanova		brb on Xchat :-)
2006-11-27T14:35:00.000Z	DARKGuy	Casanova	Maybe, that was weird because the log was correct and no errors there oO
2006-11-27T14:37:00.000Z	DARKGuy	Casanova	welcome back :P
2006-11-27T14:37:00.000Z	Casanova	DARKGuy	thank you :-) GNOME has never felt so good
2006-11-27T14:37:00.000Z	DARKGuy	Casanova	Hehe, it -is- good too ;)
2006-11-27T14:38:00.000Z	DARKGuy	Casanova	Glad you got back into X =)
