2008-10-19T06:55:00.000Z	davidf		Hello, I'm having a dependency problem when trying to upgrade... I get errors that python2.4 is not configured yet, but it is installed, and I can't re-install it for the same reason.  Could anyone help with this?
2008-10-19T06:56:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	davidf	can you pastebin the error?
2008-10-19T06:57:00.000Z	davidf	danbh_intrepid	sure. Thanks.
2008-10-19T07:02:00.000Z	davidf	danbh_intrepid	 http://pastebin.com/d2152bfa3 This same thing happens when I try to upgrade anything.
2008-10-19T07:04:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	davidf	why are you installing python 2.4?
2008-10-19T07:05:00.000Z	davidf	danbh_intrepid	 well, I'm not really. I just wanted to do a system update, and found nothing dependent on python2.4 (which is practically everything) will not update.
2008-10-19T07:07:00.000Z	davidf	danbh_intrepid	 I meant nothing WILL update. Due to dependencies. So I thought about uninstalling pyton2.4 and reinstalling, but that would require removing about 130 programs along with it.
2008-10-19T07:07:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	davidf	try this: sudo apt-get --purge remove python2.4 python2.4-minimal python2.4-dev python2.4-gdbm python2.4-tk
2008-10-19T07:07:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid		wait
2008-10-19T07:07:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	davidf	wrong command
2008-10-19T07:08:00.000Z	davidf	danbh_intrepid	 ok....
2008-10-19T07:08:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	davidf	sudo dpkg --purge remove python2.4 python2.4-minimal python2.4-dev python2.4-gdbm python2.4-tk
2008-10-19T07:08:00.000Z	davidf	danbh_intrepid	will that affect anything that depends on python2.4, like evolution, eg.?
2008-10-19T07:08:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	davidf	then sudo apt-get clean, and then try again maybe
2008-10-19T07:09:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	davidf	I think it will leave it in a broken state, btw, are you running hardy?
2008-10-19T07:09:00.000Z	davidf	danbh_intrepid	 I didn't understand 'sudo apt-get clean?
2008-10-19T07:10:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	davidf	its another command, that you run on a terminal
2008-10-19T07:10:00.000Z	davidf	danbh_intrepid	6.06 LTS
2008-10-19T07:11:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	davidf	ah, well, give it a go, then install ubuntu-desktop and linux-generic.  If you need help with the commands for those, I can help there too.  And you should think about upgrading to hardy
2008-10-19T07:13:00.000Z	davidf	danbh_intrepid	I'm not very knowlegeable. Install linux generic? desktop? BTW I have a great deal of important stuff on this box I can't afford to lose...
2008-10-19T07:15:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	davidf	both of those packages are essential for the operation of your system
2008-10-19T07:16:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	davidf	also, you may want a separate /home.  I dunno
2008-10-19T07:20:00.000Z	davidf	danbh_intrepid	I can't remove python 2.4 because lots of other things depend on it. The command doesn't work. Same thing. Can't remove it, can't upgrade it. ARGHH!
2008-10-19T07:29:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	davidf	try this : sudo dpkg --force-depends --purge python2.4-minimal python2.4 python2.4-dev python2.4-gdbm python2.4-tk && sudo apt-get clean && sudo apt-get -f install
