2007-09-11T05:12:00.000Z	modor		I'm listening to streamripper, and select a shoutcast as a bookmark
2007-09-11T05:12:00.000Z	modor		when I want to go to that bookmark, it's incorrectly translated
2007-09-11T05:12:00.000Z	modor		it puts a comma in the url
2007-09-11T05:13:00.000Z	modor		seems that would be a bug to report
2007-09-11T05:13:00.000Z	modor		for example, if I select the radio button for the bookmark I just made....
2007-09-11T05:13:00.000Z	modor		this error pops up.....
2007-09-11T05:13:00.000Z	modor		Firefox can't find the server at www.977music,com.com.
2007-09-11T05:14:00.000Z	modor		it adds a comma in the url
2007-09-11T05:14:00.000Z	modor		how would I report this bug for streamripper?
2007-09-11T05:14:00.000Z	thoreauputic	modor	all of them or just that one?
2007-09-11T05:14:00.000Z	modor		let me check
2007-09-11T05:15:00.000Z	modor		brb
2007-09-11T05:15:00.000Z	thoreauputic	modor	and the answer to the bug report question is launchpad.net
2007-09-11T05:17:00.000Z	modor	thoreauputic	  I just bookmarked two additional shoutcast stations, and both of them have similar error, with comma in the  url
2007-09-11T05:17:00.000Z	modor		could that be a feisty thing>
2007-09-11T05:17:00.000Z	modor		?
2007-09-11T05:18:00.000Z	thoreauputic	modor	never seen it myself - I think you mean streamtuner actually?
2007-09-11T05:19:00.000Z	modor	thoreauputic	 it seems a blatant error for program, that's why I wondered about feisty
2007-09-11T05:19:00.000Z	thoreauputic	modor	as i said, I haven't seen it - and I use streamtuner and streamripper on feisty
2007-09-11T05:20:00.000Z	modor	thoreauputic	okay, I am at launchpad
2007-09-11T05:21:00.000Z	modor	thoreauputic	one more silly question
2007-09-11T05:22:00.000Z	modor		I selected the interface window to be displayed 'on top' of my screen, it disappeared, and I am not sure how to get it back
2007-09-11T05:23:00.000Z	modor		the interface sort of remind me of winamp
2007-09-11T05:26:00.000Z	modor	thoreauputic	thank you for your reference
