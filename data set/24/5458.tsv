2009-09-17T00:07:00.000Z	sil3nt|warri0r		having prob with creating fat32 fs, the partition was formated with solaris fs before
2009-09-17T00:08:00.000Z	sil3nt|warri0r		now i want it to format as vfat/fat32
2009-09-17T00:08:00.000Z	sil3nt|warri0r		but its not working
2009-09-17T00:08:00.000Z	sil3nt|warri0r		:(
2009-09-17T00:08:00.000Z	erUSUL	sil3nt|warri0r	use gparted
2009-09-17T00:11:00.000Z	sil3nt|warri0r	erUSUL	mkfs.vfat gives no error, but when i fdisk -l, i saw the partiton is still showing linux as fs
2009-09-17T00:12:00.000Z	erUSUL	sil3nt|warri0r	that's the parition type you can change it with fdisk. does not afect the actual filesystem it it though
2009-09-17T00:14:00.000Z	sil3nt|warri0r	erUSUL	so how one can actually format a partition as vfat/fat32 in linux in existing partition
2009-09-17T00:14:00.000Z	erUSUL	sil3nt|warri0r	just as you did.
2009-09-17T00:16:00.000Z	erUSUL	sil3nt|warri0r	and as i said earlier you can change the partition type with fdisk
2009-09-17T00:16:00.000Z	sil3nt|warri0r	erUSUL	but then its not showing the partiton as vfat
2009-09-17T00:17:00.000Z	erUSUL	sil3nt|warri0r	do you get an error if you mount it as vfat ?
2009-09-17T00:17:00.000Z	sil3nt|warri0r	erUSUL	can i change the type of a existing partiton ?
2009-09-17T00:17:00.000Z	erUSUL	sil3nt|warri0r	sudo mount -t vfat /dev/sdxx /mount/point
2009-09-17T00:18:00.000Z	erUSUL	sil3nt|warri0r	tyes for the third time fdisk can do it
2009-09-17T00:20:00.000Z	sil3nt|warri0r	erUSUL	no error given
2009-09-17T00:20:00.000Z	erUSUL	sil3nt|warri0r	what error ?
2009-09-17T00:20:00.000Z	erUSUL	sil3nt|warri0r	when mounting no error. so the filesystem works as spected. that fact that appears as a solaris parition is cosmetical ...
2009-09-17T00:21:00.000Z	sil3nt|warri0r	erUSUL	but when i try to install vista on that partiton, it says 'could not find a proper system volume'
2009-09-17T00:21:00.000Z	sil3nt|warri0r	erUSUL	hmm
2009-09-17T00:21:00.000Z	erUSUL	sil3nt|warri0r	dunno sorry. if it is for installing vista in it why are you formatting it as vfat ?
2009-09-17T00:21:00.000Z	sil3nt|warri0r	erUSUL	and also the vista dvd cant even format that as ntfs
2009-09-17T00:21:00.000Z	erUSUL	sil3nt|warri0r	just leave the space as not paritioned and parition it dring install
2009-09-17T00:23:00.000Z	sil3nt|warri0r	erUSUL	sda1 formated as hfs, sda2 as vfat (showing linux), sda3 as linux (boot)
