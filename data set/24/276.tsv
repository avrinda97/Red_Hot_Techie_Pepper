2012-01-04T21:55:00.000Z	t1berius		Is there something wrong with Ubuntu's 'chsh' command? I try to change use it to change from Bash to ZSH to no avail several times. When I went to view the man pages, none of the flags for it work, and all produce errors of 'invalid option' except the -s flag to actually change the default shell....and that -s flag doesn't even work itself.
2012-01-04T21:56:00.000Z	t1berius		I've tried running the chsh command as a normal user and as sudo with no luck, on Ubuntu 11.10, but also have had this problem on 10.04
2012-01-04T21:58:00.000Z	llutz	t1berius	works here as expected
2012-01-04T21:59:00.000Z	t1berius	llutz	seems like a pretty simple thing...any clue why it's acting up?
2012-01-04T21:59:00.000Z	llutz	t1berius	nope
2012-01-04T22:00:00.000Z	t1berius		:/
2012-01-04T22:00:00.000Z	llutz	t1berius	just to be sure: you already have zsh installed?
2012-01-04T22:00:00.000Z	t1berius		yes llutz
2012-01-04T22:00:00.000Z	t1berius		I have to invoke it manually
2012-01-04T22:01:00.000Z	t1berius		normally I'm used to launching gnome-terminal and being thrown into tmux with zsh as my shell, since I have a snippet in my .zshrc file to automatically detect whether a tmux session is running and attach to it, if not, create one and jump in
2012-01-04T22:01:00.000Z	t1berius		now, I'm just brought into normal bash and have to manually launch zsh
2012-01-04T22:01:00.000Z	llutz	t1berius	getent passwd <youruser>           what does it show as shell?

2012-01-04T22:02:00.000Z	t1berius		missed an h
2012-01-04T22:02:00.000Z	llutz	t1berius	so gnome-terminal thingy
2012-01-04T22:02:00.000Z	t1berius	llutz	mohomed:x:1001:1001:mohomed,,,:/home/mohomed:/bin/zsh
2012-01-04T22:02:00.000Z	t1berius		I see
2012-01-04T22:03:00.000Z	llutz	t1berius	did you logout/relogin after chsh to zsh?
2012-01-04T22:03:00.000Z	t1berius		not yet
2012-01-04T22:03:00.000Z	t1berius		that's probably it
2012-01-04T22:03:00.000Z	t1berius		I'll try that llutz, thanks

2012-01-04T22:08:00.000Z	t1berius		Besides using gnome-tweak-tool, is there no other way to change the system fonts in Ubuntu 11.10 Oneiric anymore ?
2012-01-04T22:15:00.000Z	t1berius	llutz	great success after a reboot :)
