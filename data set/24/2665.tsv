2008-10-13T12:07:00.000Z	ubuntoRoxx		I have a text document lying on the remote server. i have logged in using SSH, and now I want to edit the document. How do I do that?
2008-10-13T12:07:00.000Z	Flannel	ubuntoRoxx	nano, vim, etc.
2008-10-13T12:08:00.000Z	ubuntoRoxx	Flannel	But when i write nedit myfile.txt & then I get the message Can't open display
2008-10-13T12:08:00.000Z	Flannel	ubuntoRoxx	nano, not nedit.  nedit is a GUI
2008-10-13T12:09:00.000Z	ubuntoRoxx	Flannel	Aha, so I needs to be textbased?
2008-10-13T12:09:00.000Z	Flannel	ubuntoRoxx	Correct, or you need to do X forwarding
2008-10-13T12:10:00.000Z	ubuntoRoxx	Flannel	Hmm now i tried nano myFile.txt & but nothing happend
2008-10-13T12:10:00.000Z	Flannel	ubuntoRoxx	Why did you put the & at the end?
2008-10-13T12:10:00.000Z	ubuntoRoxx	Flannel	So i can used the terminal
2008-10-13T12:11:00.000Z	Flannel	ubuntoRoxx	What the & does is means it gets sent to the background.  Whcih means it wont come up so you can see it.  It's running currently (type "jobs") but you may want to look into using screen to give you multiple terminals in one session
2008-10-13T12:11:00.000Z	Flannel	ubuntoRoxx	when you type "jobs" you'll see the stuff running in the background with a number next to it, type %# where # is the number, to bring that to the foreground
2008-10-13T12:12:00.000Z	Flannel	ubuntoRoxx	use nano, not vim
2008-10-13T12:12:00.000Z	ubuntoRoxx	Flannel	Why is Nano better?
2008-10-13T12:13:00.000Z	Flannel	ubuntoRoxx	nano is more similar to a 'regular' text editor.
2008-10-13T12:13:00.000Z	ubuntoRoxx	Flannel	vim is VI right?
2008-10-13T12:13:00.000Z	Flannel	ubuntoRoxx	vim is related to vi, yes.
2008-10-13T12:13:00.000Z	ubuntoRoxx	Flannel	What is the difference then?
2008-10-13T12:13:00.000Z	Flannel	ubuntoRoxx	Difference between what?
2008-10-13T12:14:00.000Z	ubuntoRoxx	Flannel	vim and vi
2008-10-13T12:15:00.000Z	Flannel	ubuntoRoxx	uh, vim is "vi improved", its got more features, and... specifics are outside the scope of this channel.
2008-12-06T12:59:00.000Z	Flannel	ubuntoRoxx	Whats wrong with the java in the repos?
2008-12-06T13:00:00.000Z	ubuntoRoxx	Flannel	The problem is that this is only the runtime environment(JRE). I need the development environment(JDK)
2008-12-06T13:01:00.000Z	Flannel	ubuntoRoxx	JDK is in the repos too
2008-12-06T13:01:00.000Z	ubuntoRoxx	Flannel	Is it? But where?
