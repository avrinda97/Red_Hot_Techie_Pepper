2009-12-12T06:13:00.000Z	rodgerr		I am about to upgrade my hardware processor (Athalon 32 bit) and motherboard to get access to virtualization with a new AMD Athalon 64.  I want to just put the hard drive into the new machine.  I will use the same video card.  I am pretty sure that will work since the 32 bit architecture is available in the 64 bit version of the AMD Athalon 64.  What is the best way to get Ubuntu to update...
2009-12-12T06:13:00.000Z	rodgerr		...to the 64 bit version... and can anyone see any issues I may face (first time updating hardware in a Linux environment)
2009-12-12T06:15:00.000Z	DasEi1	rodgerr	if you go 32 > 64 bit , you need a fresh install
2009-12-12T06:32:00.000Z	DasEi1	rodgerr	you can do a dist upgrade, but why do you want to change to 64 bit at all ?
2009-12-12T06:33:00.000Z	DasEi1	rodgerr	can do also in 32
2009-12-12T06:34:00.000Z	DasEi1	rodgerr	it's just the cpu that supports it or not, both 32 abd 64
2009-12-12T06:35:00.000Z	DasEi1	rodgerr	so a socket a athlon ?
2009-12-12T06:35:00.000Z	DasEi1	rodgerr	nah, is it running   any os at this time ?
2009-12-12T06:36:00.000Z	rodgerr	DasEi1	Ubuntu  - it is what I am taking to you on
2009-12-12T06:36:00.000Z	DasEi1	rodgerr	sudo apt-get install hwinfo pastebinit
2009-12-12T06:37:00.000Z	DasEi1	rodgerr	hwinfo -vv | pastebinit
2009-12-12T07:01:00.000Z	rodgerr	DasEi1	did  a simple hwinfo and piped it over to http://pastebin.com/f444b2de2
2009-12-12T07:02:00.000Z	rodgerr	DasEi1	what are you looking for - I piped it to more also, so I could look at it
2009-12-12T07:06:00.000Z	rodgerr	DasEi1	RAM?? I thought it used a specific amount of disk space?  I only have two gigs on this machine
2009-12-12T07:07:00.000Z	rodgerr	DasEi1	it is a KV7-V(VIA KT600-8237)'
2009-12-12T07:07:00.000Z	rodgerr	DasEi1	phoenix mother board
2009-12-12T07:08:00.000Z	rodgerr	DasEi1	I have space for one more gig of memory
2009-12-12T07:09:00.000Z	rodgerr	DasEi1	So you are proposing an ALL software virtualization? rather than the CPU calls??
2009-12-12T07:11:00.000Z	rodgerr	DasEi1	I tried Wine which did not work and looked at Crossover - which did not look promising - so I decided to give virtualization a try - THOUGHT I had to upgrade to a CPU with calls to get it done
2009-12-12T07:12:00.000Z	rodgerr	DasEi1	anm currently not running any virtual amchine
2009-12-12T07:17:00.000Z	rodgerr	DasEi1	Oh - which version of Ubuntu : Karmic 9.10 vmlinuz-2.6.31-16-generic
2009-12-12T07:19:00.000Z	rodgerr	DasEi1	and a AMD Athlon(tm) XP 2900+
2009-12-12T07:31:00.000Z	rodgerr	DasEi1	I am more interested in getting Windows XP to run for myself - I have a proprietary product that I MUST access and nothing in Open Source to replace it
2009-12-12T07:59:00.000Z	rodgerr	DasEi1	I should load virtual box OSE from the application library then??
