2008-12-23T09:58:00.000Z	cplab2-58		onetinsoldier; i m trying to install packages which are not there in the cd
2008-12-23T09:58:00.000Z	cplab2-58		onetinsoldier; the other systems do not have net connection so i have to make updations
2008-12-23T09:59:00.000Z	cplab2-58		Org-Mode; thats why i have used aptoncd
2008-12-23T10:00:00.000Z	FAJ	cplab2-58	 aptoncd does not save the packages for reinstall; it just saves a list of packages.
2008-12-23T10:01:00.000Z	FAJ	cplab2-58	 going to packages.ubuntu.com and getting the files that you need to get your internet up, and using a flash drive back and forth .
2008-12-23T10:02:00.000Z	FAJ	cplab2-58	 so just get the packages from packages.ubuntu.com  and get the ones you need to get your internet working...
2008-12-23T10:03:00.000Z	FAJ	cplab2-58	 again internet will be your best option.
2008-12-23T10:03:00.000Z	FAJ	cplab2-58	 yes.
2008-12-23T10:03:00.000Z	FAJ	cplab2-58	http://packages.ubuntu.com/
2008-12-23T10:08:00.000Z	FAJ	cplab2-58	again getting the free cds, using packages.ubuntu.com or getting on the internet...
2008-12-23T10:08:00.000Z	FAJ	cplab2-58	 ok good choice ;)
2008-12-23T10:09:00.000Z	FAJ	cplab2-58	 you look them up one by one through searching in the specific release you want them.
2008-12-23T10:10:00.000Z	FAJ	cplab2-58	 no; you will see the dependencies in each package; you need to dll them too.
2008-12-23T10:10:00.000Z	FAJ	cplab2-58	 i think they are crazy; i have never heard that :)
2008-12-23T10:13:00.000Z	FAJ	cplab2-58	 ya i know that is why ripping out the ethernet cable and plugging it into the other machine is useful
2008-12-23T10:15:00.000Z	FAJ	cplab2-58	i've never had to do that.... however once you dll all the packages on one flash drive, just make 65 copies and that may make life easier?
2008-12-23T10:17:00.000Z	FAJ	cplab2-58	with aptoncd what will happen is that all it will do is take the cd and tell the computer WHICH packages to install FROM THE INTERNET
2008-12-23T10:18:00.000Z	FAJ	cplab2-58	 i have never done this before; but you could try only downloading those packages to a mother machine through the repos and then putting all of those on a flash drive; again cd would be best from here.
2008-12-23T10:18:00.000Z	FAJ	cplab2-58	 you will have to go to all of the computers and install all of the packages.....
2008-12-23T10:19:00.000Z	FAJ	cplab2-58	got it!
2008-12-23T10:21:00.000Z	FAJ	cplab2-58	 with that command you should be able to install all .deb packages on the flash drive; just change <directory> to where you need it to go
2008-12-23T10:22:00.000Z	FAJ	cplab2-58	 if you have all of the packages... then sudo dpkg -iR <directory path> *should* work...
2008-12-23T10:23:00.000Z	FAJ	cplab2-58	 i dunno if you could do it over a lan,,, if all of the computers are connected,, but it looks like musikgoat|main has a apt-proxy package for you.
2008-12-23T10:23:00.000Z	FAJ	cplab2-58	 that is install|recursive
