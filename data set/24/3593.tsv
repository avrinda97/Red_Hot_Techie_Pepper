2008-01-18T10:39:00.000Z	nickrud	sdakak	yes
2008-01-18T10:36:00.000Z	nickrud	sdakak	gtk2 themes everything inside the window borders.  gtk1 is obsolete, but a couple of apps still use it. It also themes the stuff inside the window borders
2008-01-18T10:40:00.000Z	sdakak	nickrud	now tell me are compiz themes = emerald?
2008-01-18T10:41:00.000Z	nickrud	sdakak	emerald a window border decorator
2008-01-18T10:42:00.000Z	nickrud	sdakak	you can use metacity themes, but most people choose to use emerald
2008-01-18T10:42:00.000Z	nickrud	sdakak	the beryl project is dead, but the emerald decorator it used is now used with compiz
2008-01-18T10:44:00.000Z	nickrud	sdakak	emerald, it was carried over when beryl merged back with compiz to create compiz-fusion
2008-01-18T10:44:00.000Z	nickrud	sdakak	yes
2008-01-18T10:44:00.000Z	sdakak	nickrud	and beryl themes = ?
2008-01-18T10:45:00.000Z	nickrud	sdakak	= dead
2008-01-18T10:46:00.000Z	sdakak	nickrud	if i want to use compiz themes, than what would i have to do? i installed emerald-theme-manager and got one of the compiz themes from gnome-look. i didn't know how to disable metacity themes and enable the emerald theme. so i just did a reboot and now i have the emerald theme on. now if i want metacity back what do i do? (how do we easily change between the two?). i opened emerald-theme-manager and deleted my only emerald theme and did a reboot.
2008-01-18T10:47:00.000Z	nickrud	sdakak	to change over to emerald themes, type:  alt-f2  emerald --replace . To go back to metacity, type   alt-f2 metacity --replace
2008-01-18T10:48:00.000Z	sdakak	nickrud	can it be done through the gui?
2008-01-18T10:48:00.000Z	nickrud	sdakak	not that I know of
2008-01-18T10:48:00.000Z	sdakak	nickrud	like we have 'live' changes for metacity themes does the same apply to compiz themes?
2008-01-18T10:49:00.000Z	sdakak	nickrud	the emerald theme that is active at the moment has been deleted by me. but still it is on. how do i remove it?
2008-01-18T10:49:00.000Z	nickrud	sdakak	not for me, I was just told that because I'm using ati with xserver-xgl there's a bug that requires me to do emerald --replace to apply any changes.
2008-01-18T10:50:00.000Z	nickrud	sdakak	We've pretty much exhausted what I know about compiz :)  The people on #compiz-fusion know much more than I do
2008-01-18T10:50:00.000Z	sdakak	nickrud	emerald --replace and metacity --replace, can be used safely in a nvidia system, right? or are there more 'correct' ways to toggle it?
2008-01-18T10:50:00.000Z	sdakak	nickrud	thank you.
2008-01-18T10:50:00.000Z	nickrud	sdakak	that's the only way I've ever seen mentioned. Like I said, #compiz-fusion knows best
2008-04-06T22:02:00.000Z	nickrud	sdakak	#ubuntu+1 is handling hardy questions until release,  /j #ubuntu+1 (and no, the beta has already had hundreds of megs of updates)
2008-04-06T22:06:00.000Z	sdakak	nickrud	thanks
2008-07-16T09:34:00.000Z	nickrud	sdakak	you probably want to ask on #ubuntu-offtopic, that channel spends time rating apps, not so much here
