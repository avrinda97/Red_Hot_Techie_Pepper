2011-11-13T00:42:00.000Z	Galvatron	nightwalkerkg	What card is it?
2011-11-13T00:51:00.000Z	Galvatron	nightwalkerkg	Try stopping X with "sudo service gdm stop", or lightdm for 11.10, - this will turn off the X-server -  then remove the old xorg.conf with "sudo rm /etc/X11/xorg.conf", create new with "sudo X -configure" and get back to X with "sudo service gdm start".
2011-11-13T00:52:00.000Z	nightwalkerkg	Galvatron	ok.
2011-11-13T00:52:00.000Z	nightwalkerkg	Galvatron	gdm: unrecognized service
2011-11-13T00:53:00.000Z	Galvatron	nightwalkerkg	Then "lightdm"
2011-11-13T00:56:00.000Z	Galvatron	nightwalkerkg	Also, if this card causes you too much trouble, simply don't waste you time for troubleshooting and geat a used 7300GT, oraz a new, recently released Zotac GT 520 PCI (not PCI-E) - the latter will give you a hardware-accelerated video playback.
2011-11-13T01:21:00.000Z	nightwalkerkg	Galvatron	i need 1152x720 or 1152x820 not sure,can i force it some how?
2011-11-13T01:16:00.000Z	nightwalkerkg	Galvatron	the screen went black when i typed in the command.
2011-11-13T01:16:00.000Z	nightwalkerkg	Galvatron	is there any way to force the screen resolution?
2011-11-13T01:19:00.000Z	Galvatron	nightwalkerkg	It went balck because you probably neen a GRUB reconfiguration first.
2011-11-13T01:22:00.000Z	Galvatron	nightwalkerkg	To avoid screen going black and be able to recnfigure X, you need a GRUB "tweak"
2011-11-13T01:23:00.000Z	nightwalkerkg	Galvatron	ok i am going to install it,can you guid me the rest of the process.
2011-11-13T01:24:00.000Z	Galvatron	nightwalkerkg	First, "gksu gedit /etc/default/grub"
2011-11-13T01:25:00.000Z	nightwalkerkg	Galvatron	ok,next
2011-11-13T01:25:00.000Z	nightwalkerkg	Galvatron	do i erease quiet splash?
2011-11-13T01:26:00.000Z	Galvatron	nightwalkerkg	Uncomment GRUB_GFXMODE= and change the resolution to higher one, corresponding your screen proportions
2011-11-13T01:26:00.000Z	Galvatron	nightwalkerkg	It's a good Idea
2011-11-13T01:27:00.000Z	nightwalkerkg	Galvatron	save it now?
2011-11-13T01:27:00.000Z	Galvatron	nightwalkerkg	When you're done, use "sudo update-grub" and reboot. Now you should be able to normally enter the terminal/text mode (Alt + F1), withou screen going black/blank
2011-11-13T01:28:00.000Z	nightwalkerkg	Galvatron	give me the commands for X again.
2011-11-13T01:29:00.000Z	Galvatron	nightwalkerkg	Stop X with "sudo service gdm stop", or lightdm for 11.10, - this will turn off the X-server - then remove the old xorg.conf with "sudo rm /etc/X11/xorg.conf", create new with "sudo X -configure" and get back to X with "sudo service gdm start".
2011-11-13T01:29:00.000Z	Galvatron	nightwalkerkg	For you it'll be "lightdm", nit "gdm"
2011-11-13T01:30:00.000Z	nightwalkerkg	Galvatron	tnx,back in a sec with the results.
