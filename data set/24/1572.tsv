2009-11-22T04:19:00.000Z	Wallace	trevorj	& don't forget nfs & samba :)
2009-11-22T04:19:00.000Z	trevorj	Wallace	nfs and samba aren't usually run remotely ;)
2009-11-22T04:20:00.000Z	Wallace	trevorj	well they certainly aren't run locally ;)
2009-11-22T04:49:00.000Z	trevorj	Wallace	I was wrong, it's actually $IFACE
2009-11-22T04:34:00.000Z	trevorj	Wallace	usplash is not a bootloader
2009-11-22T04:35:00.000Z	trevorj	Wallace	usplash is a function of the kernel to display the splashscreen upon bootup before X is loaded
2009-11-22T04:35:00.000Z	trevorj	Wallace	the splashimage itself is stored in the initramfs iirc
2009-11-22T04:36:00.000Z	Wallace	trevorj	well, i'm stumped there then :\
2009-11-22T04:46:00.000Z	trevorj	Wallace	doesn't networkmanager still call the /etc/network/if-up.d/* scripts?
2009-11-22T04:47:00.000Z	trevorj	Wallace	they are all called upon any interface up
2009-11-22T04:48:00.000Z	Wallace	trevorj	okay, so how do i write conditional code based upon a specific interface?  (I want to replace my hosts file with a different one depending on the interface in use)
2009-11-22T04:49:00.000Z	trevorj	Wallace	they are called with $1 being the interface name, iirc
2009-11-22T04:49:00.000Z	Wallace	trevorj	ahh, kthx, will look into it
2009-11-22T04:49:00.000Z	Wallace	trevorj	cool, thx
2009-11-22T04:50:00.000Z	Wallace	trevorj	time for some script hacking then
2009-11-22T04:51:00.000Z	Wallace	trevorj	also, do you know how I can kick off a vpn connection configured in network manager from the cmdline?  I want my vpn to come up if I connect my wireless (3g/mobile) , but not my wifi
2009-11-22T04:52:00.000Z	trevorj	Wallace	configured from network-manager? sorry, possibly something with nm-tool
2009-11-22T04:53:00.000Z	Wallace	trevorj	the gui network manager...I've configured it all in there but i only want my vpn to connect if my 3g lilnk comes up
2009-11-22T04:53:00.000Z	Wallace	trevorj	... so i want to script it
2009-11-22T05:02:00.000Z	Wallace	trevorj	seq.... that's what i was looking for ;)
2009-11-22T05:02:00.000Z	trevorj	Wallace	seq is very very nice
2009-11-22T05:02:00.000Z	trevorj	Wallace	for such a simple tool, who knew it would be so damn effective
2009-11-22T05:02:00.000Z	Wallace	trevorj	i keep finding new stuff in unix that's useful....and i've been using it for 15 years
2009-11-22T05:02:00.000Z	trevorj	Wallace	I feel you, fellow old hat
