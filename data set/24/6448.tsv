2006-05-30T06:47:00.000Z	gnomefreak	mrproper	go to the one for dapper and download it than dpkg -i  to install it
2006-05-30T06:48:00.000Z	mrproper	gnomefreak	There isn't one for dapper.
2006-05-30T06:48:00.000Z	gnomefreak	mrproper	there was

2006-05-30T06:49:00.000Z	mrproper	gnomefreak	Oh you're a god among men
2006-05-30T06:50:00.000Z	mrproper	gnomefreak	Oh you're awesome.  Thank you very much.  They don't list the dapper install on their download page for beta, that's all.
2006-05-30T06:51:00.000Z	gnomefreak	mrproper	thats why i made that factoid in ubotu ;)

2006-07-04T08:45:00.000Z	gnomefreak	mrproper	its a good chance here is a command to fix that sudo sed -e 's/us\.//' -i /etc/apt/sources.list
2006-07-04T08:46:00.000Z	mrproper	gnomefreak	What was wrong with it?

2006-07-08T13:48:00.000Z	mrproper	gnomefreak	Does it need to reinstall?
2006-07-08T13:49:00.000Z	gnomefreak	mrproper	aptitude will install suggested and recommended packages along with the package you want
2006-07-08T13:49:00.000Z	mrproper	gnomefreak	I have all the packages I want.
