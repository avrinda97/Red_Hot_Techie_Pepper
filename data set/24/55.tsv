2012-09-16T16:50:00.000Z	layke__		I just tried to install something, and it says.. "You will have to enable the component called 'multiverse'"
2012-09-16T16:50:00.000Z	layke__		How would I do this. Do I just look in my /etc/apt/sources.list and find something that says multiverse?
2012-09-16T16:50:00.000Z	layke__		Is there only one multiverse? Or is there lots? Not sure what it really means
2012-09-16T16:51:00.000Z	yeats	layke__	open software center and Edit -> Software Sources... is the easiest way
2012-09-16T16:53:00.000Z	yeats	layke__	in the software sources it's a checkbox you can just click
2012-09-16T16:53:00.000Z	layke__	yeats	: Is it "software restricted by copyright or legal issues"? That looks like it is already ticked for me.
2012-09-16T16:54:00.000Z	layke__	yeats	O actually I'm being an idiot. I'm trying to install multiverse on my server. Not my desktop. lol.
2012-09-16T16:55:00.000Z	yeats	layke__	ah ok ;-) - in that case you might see if theres a line to uncomment in /etc/apt/sources.list
2012-09-16T16:55:00.000Z	layke__	yeats	No there isn't. Did you see that pastie I provided?
2012-09-16T16:57:00.000Z	layke__	yeats	On this page  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/CommandLine#Adding_the_Universe_and_Multiverse_Repositories It says "hardy multiverse" What's the significance of "hardy" Is that like lucid? etc
2012-09-16T16:58:00.000Z	yeats	layke__	yes - replace 'hardy' with the name of the release you're on
2012-09-16T16:59:00.000Z	yeats	layke__	'lucid-updates' yes
2012-09-16T17:00:00.000Z	layke__	yeats	Thanks for the advice. So are releases just code names? ie.. for the version of the release? I haven't understood the signifncance of release names?
2012-09-16T17:00:00.000Z	yeats	layke__	correct
2012-09-16T17:00:00.000Z	layke__	yeats	So for example, the fact that I am on "lucid" means that I am on version 10 of ubuntu. And anyone on hardy, must be 8.0.
2012-09-16T17:01:00.000Z	yeats	layke__	lucid = 10.04, hardy = 8.04
2012-09-16T17:01:00.000Z	yeats	layke__	numbers are year.month
2012-09-16T17:02:00.000Z	yeats	layke__	well, they *are*, but they're timed releases, thus numbered that way ;-)
2012-09-16T17:10:00.000Z	layke__	yeats	I just installed the package that I wanted, but I noticed it's really old. I think I want to ditch it and download the latest version and install it myself. Would I just `apt-get remove ec2-api-tools` and then download the ZIP file that Amazon provide, and extra the /bin/* to /usr/bin on my own system?
2012-09-16T17:11:00.000Z	yeats	layke__	I don't know about that specific package, but you might investigate PPAs for the package you're looking for (or a .deb or repo from amazon if they offer it)
2012-09-16T17:11:00.000Z	yeats	layke__	only if that approach doesn't work would I consider installing manually
2012-09-16T17:12:00.000Z	yeats	layke__	cool
2012-09-16T17:13:00.000Z	yeats	layke__	I would probably use this (keeping in mind the caveats about ppas in general): https://launchpad.net/~awstools-dev/+archive/awstools
2012-09-16T17:14:00.000Z	yeats	layke__	once you add the PPA you can do 'sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade' and it should upgrade the older package
