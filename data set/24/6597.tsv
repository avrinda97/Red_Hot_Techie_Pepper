2007-03-26T15:57:00.000Z	Flannel	MrX|ubu	that looks like a DNS issue, looks like it thinks security.ubuntu.com i 1.0.0.0
2007-03-26T16:02:00.000Z	Flannel	MrX|ubu	Can you browse to security.ubuntu.com in a web browser?
2007-03-26T16:03:00.000Z	Flannel	MrX|ubu	Did you just edit the IPv6 stuff recently?
2007-03-26T16:04:00.000Z	Flannel	MrX|ubu	as much as I hate to say it, you might try rebooting.  Could be that the IPv6 disabling hasn't taken affect in all stuff yet (since it was running pre-disable)
2007-03-26T16:06:00.000Z	Flannel	MrX|ubu	alright, that's not it then.  But, the fact that you can get there in a browser is a bit odd.  Do you have any proxy settings or anything out of the ordinary like that?
2007-03-26T16:11:00.000Z	Flannel	MrX|ubu	I believe your issue isn't with your linux system, but with your DNS.
2007-03-26T16:12:00.000Z	Flannel	MrX|ubu	I think it's a router issue, not an ISP issue.
2007-03-26T16:15:00.000Z	Flannel	MrX|ubu	You're on ADSL, right?
2007-03-26T16:16:00.000Z	Flannel	MrX|ubu	you'll want to read that too.  And follow the links on the bottom, I believe.
2007-03-26T16:18:00.000Z	Flannel	MrX|ubu	so, it doesn't appear to be a bug in ubuntu, but a bug in your router/modem instead.  But you can apparently workaround it.
2007-03-26T16:19:00.000Z	Flannel	MrX|ubu	solution is in that bugreport, setting DNS manually is one, upgrading firmware might also work, more stuff on that page.
2007-03-26T16:20:00.000Z	Flannel	MrX|ubu	alright, then you'll need to set your DNS manually, I believe.
2007-03-26T16:21:00.000Z	Flannel	MrX|ubu	Your ISP should provide you with DNS servers.  Or, you could host your own.
2007-03-26T16:34:00.000Z	Flannel	MrX|ubu	you need to use sudo to open the editor
