2008-11-07T17:37:00.000Z	felli		error remains
2008-11-07T17:37:00.000Z	gcbirzan	felli	Try aptitude update?
2008-11-07T17:39:00.000Z	gcbirzan	felli	Did you install any weird software?
2008-11-07T17:40:00.000Z	gcbirzan	felli	What does dpkg-divert --list /usr say?
2008-11-07T17:41:00.000Z	gcbirzan	felli	That's,hm. dpkg -l /usr/bin, what does that say?
2008-11-07T17:42:00.000Z	gcbirzan	felli	Hm. Okay, well. Go look in /var/lib/dpkg/diversions
2008-11-07T17:42:00.000Z	gcbirzan	felli	You should find that diversion somewhere in there.
2008-11-07T17:43:00.000Z	gcbirzan	felli	Should look like /usr\n/.\n/usr/bin
2008-11-07T17:43:00.000Z	gcbirzan	felli	Or, hm. How big is that file?
2008-11-07T17:44:00.000Z	gcbirzan	felli	Can you mail it to me at gcbirzan@gmail.com?
2008-11-07T17:47:00.000Z	gcbirzan	felli	You managed to screw up that file completely. :-)
2008-11-07T17:48:00.000Z	gcbirzan	felli	Look in diversions-old
2008-11-07T17:48:00.000Z	gcbirzan	felli	Paste me the first 3 lines of that in /msg
2008-11-07T17:49:00.000Z	gcbirzan	felli	Perfect. Copy that file over the diversionsone.
2008-11-07T17:49:00.000Z	gcbirzan	felli	Almost everything should start working after that.
2008-11-07T17:49:00.000Z	gcbirzan	felli	what was the last package you installed
2008-11-07T17:50:00.000Z	gcbirzan	felli	Ah, duh. Well, that package is probably buggy
2008-11-07T17:51:00.000Z	gcbirzan	felli	True. But, hm. I fail at the ubuntu bug thingy
2008-11-07T17:53:00.000Z	felli	gcbirzan	you're the best :) everything is working again :) thanks a lot :)
2008-11-07T17:54:00.000Z	gcbirzan	felli	Btw, you should report this bug
