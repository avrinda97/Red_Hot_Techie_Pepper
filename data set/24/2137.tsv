2009-04-01T05:45:00.000Z	Tokenekie		Hi, how can we apply any system updates to a live USB?
2009-04-01T05:46:00.000Z	Tokenekie		Yeah that what i thought
2009-04-01T05:46:00.000Z	Tokenekie		Where can I check for updated files? And I'm guessing we have to manually replace the files on the live USB?
2009-04-01T05:47:00.000Z	Ropechoborra	Tokenekie	You might try chrooting in the usb and then updateing I think it will do
2009-04-01T19:48:00.000Z	Ropechoborra	Tokenekie	Try chroot /liveusbfolder and then try using the normal apt.
2009-04-01T19:49:00.000Z	Tokenekie	Ropechoborra	Ill try that, Ill get back to you
2009-04-01T19:52:00.000Z	Tokenekie	Ropechoborra	When you say /liveusbfolder yoiu mean root right?
2009-04-01T19:52:00.000Z	Ropechoborra	Tokenekie	I mean the mounted usb device
2009-04-01T19:55:00.000Z	Ropechoborra	Tokenekie	with chroot you make the folder as it was the root folder. So if you have the USB mounted to /media/usb then do sudo chroot /media/usb and then the update with apt-get
2009-04-01T19:56:00.000Z	Tokenekie	Ropechoborra	terminal gives me "... /dev/sdb is not a directory"
2009-04-01T19:57:00.000Z	Ropechoborra	Tokenekie	did you boot from the live usb ? I mean, are you in that ubuntu now?
2009-04-01T19:57:00.000Z	Tokenekie	Ropechoborra	Yes, I did an fdisk -l and found my usb to be /dev/sdb
2009-04-01T19:59:00.000Z	Ropechoborra	Tokenekie	but are you using ubuntu from the LiveUSB or an ubuntu installed in a hard drive?
2009-04-01T19:59:00.000Z	Tokenekie	Ropechoborra	Ubuntu from live USB
2009-04-01T19:59:00.000Z	Ropechoborra	Tokenekie	so then forget chroot :)
2009-04-01T20:00:00.000Z	Ropechoborra	Tokenekie	do the sudo apt-get install (bbloothot package)
2009-04-01T20:00:00.000Z	Tokenekie	Ropechoborra	Ah, yes like I was telling Ubersoldat, I want to make sure I update only my bluetooth package and not everything else. I dont have that much space on my flash drive
2009-04-01T20:01:00.000Z	Ropechoborra	Tokenekie	Yeap, so put only the bluetooth package in the apt-get install command
2009-04-01T20:01:00.000Z	Tokenekie	Ropechoborra	Do you know where I can find the name of the bluetooth package?
2009-04-01T20:02:00.000Z	Tokenekie	Ropechoborra	Im trying to look for a search ability like "yum search" does
2009-04-01T20:02:00.000Z	Ropechoborra	Tokenekie	wich program are you using ?
2009-04-01T20:02:00.000Z	Ropechoborra	Tokenekie	there is one: sudo apt-cache search
2009-04-01T20:02:00.000Z	Tokenekie	Ropechoborra	ITs just the bluetooth package that comes with the live CD .iso
2009-04-01T20:04:00.000Z	Ropechoborra	Tokenekie	there is a package called "Bluetooth" (Bluetooth stack utilities) you may try that one... I'm not sure
