2006-02-26T14:01:00.000Z	NickGarvey		apt-get update is failing after I first installed ubuntu?
2006-02-26T14:01:00.000Z	LjL	NickGarvey	failing like what?
2006-02-26T14:02:00.000Z	LjL	NickGarvey	perhaps it's a problem with the mirror. the US mirror seemed to have some problems some minutes ago
2006-02-26T14:03:00.000Z	LjL	NickGarvey	even better,  apt-get update 2>&1 >~/error.txt
2006-02-26T14:06:00.000Z	NickGarvey	LjL	would the problem be no internet maybe?
2006-02-26T14:06:00.000Z	LjL	NickGarvey	oh :)
2006-02-26T14:08:00.000Z	LjL	NickGarvey	well, edit /etc/network/interface i guess... but if you have DHCP, it should work by itself
2006-02-26T14:09:00.000Z	LjL	NickGarvey	well, i would give it another chance (i.e. wait for next reboot) before i start to worry
2006-02-26T14:09:00.000Z	NickGarvey	LjL	the computer is going to be a server so it won't have a monitor, I want to be able to hit the button and have it start the ssh server so I can use it
2006-02-26T14:09:00.000Z	NickGarvey	LjL	some thing happened last night also, no internet on boot
2006-02-26T14:09:00.000Z	LjL	NickGarvey	yeah, i've got a computer like that
2006-02-26T14:10:00.000Z	LjL	NickGarvey	does your IP actually change? cause if it doesn't, you could just hardcode it -- though the best thing would surely be to find out why DHCP isn't working
2006-02-26T14:12:00.000Z	LjL	NickGarvey	well, then you could probably just edit /etc/network/interfaces and add "iface eth0 inet static <newline> address <ip>"
2006-02-26T14:12:00.000Z	LjL	NickGarvey	can you paste your current /etc/network/interfaces on the pastebin please
2006-02-26T14:15:00.000Z	NickGarvey	LjL	my router has dhcp enabled incase that wasn't obvious
2006-02-26T14:16:00.000Z	LjL	NickGarvey	well, your file looks fine to me. if you aren't the kind of guy who can't do without going to the root of the problem, then i'd simply make it use a static IP :)
2006-02-26T14:17:00.000Z	LjL	NickGarvey	well, one thing - does it *always* fail to get the address from DHCP, or it works sometimes?
2006-02-26T14:19:00.000Z	LjL	NickGarvey	well my guess then is that your router probably implements DHCP in a way that the current version of the client doesn't like too much...
2006-02-26T14:20:00.000Z	LjL	NickGarvey	(by the way, unrelated, but for a server setup, i would use Debian=
2006-02-26T14:21:00.000Z	LjL	NickGarvey	well i don't think ubuntu will be too bad as a server anyway
2006-02-26T14:23:00.000Z	NickGarvey	LjL	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/9063
2006-02-26T14:23:00.000Z	NickGarvey	LjL	is that what it should be?
2006-02-26T14:25:00.000Z	LjL	NickGarvey	that was for you
2006-03-03T16:02:00.000Z	LjL	NickGarvey	"ln -s thing otherthing"
