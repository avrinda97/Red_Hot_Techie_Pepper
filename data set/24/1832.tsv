2009-07-31T21:46:00.000Z	olaf-vom	Besogon	do you ask about NIS / DNS in general, or for a specific purpose that you want to be handled / solved ?
2009-07-31T21:47:00.000Z	Besogon	olaf-vom	Im interesting only.
2009-07-31T21:50:00.000Z	olaf-vom	Besogon	DNS is Domain Name System, main purpose is to resolve sth. like "www.ubuntu.com" to an IP address. NIS is Network Information System, very commonly used to handle user-accounts within a network. (Somewhat remoteloy similar to a Windows-domain...)
2009-07-31T21:51:00.000Z	olaf-vom	Besogon	You can't have today's internet without DNS, as otherwise your browser wouldn't find any server out there. Usually NIS is local-network-only.
2009-07-31T21:54:00.000Z	Besogon	olaf-vom	ok. now I udestand. One question else. Would I see my NIS network (with NFS shares )with nautilus? I have got one NFS-share folder but nautilus don't display that
2009-07-31T21:57:00.000Z	olaf-vom	Besogon	Hmm - I've ever only used NFS between servers and clients with fixed IPs/names within a local network. I have always mounted the NFS-shares on boot-time. Not sure what you can do in user-space on the NFS-client-side ... might well be that Nautilus supports it...
2009-07-31T22:00:00.000Z	Besogon	olaf-vom	do you use NIS?
2009-07-31T22:00:00.000Z	olaf-vom	Besogon	i have, yes. (not in the system-admin area anymore, though.)
2009-07-31T22:03:00.000Z	Besogon	olaf-vom	What for do you use that? You use that to make sure the NFS user ids/group ids are the same on the server as on all clients don't you?
2009-07-31T22:06:00.000Z	olaf-vom	Besogon	yes, that's what you get if you use NIS/NFS. also of course, without NIS (or a similar approach, more complex ones include to use LDAP e.g.), you only have entirely independent users/passwords on your machines.
2009-07-31T22:07:00.000Z	olaf-vom	Besogon	if you want to be able to "add user boss" and "add user secretary" and both people should have access to various clients/servers/machines, you will need service such as NIS.
2009-07-31T22:08:00.000Z	Besogon	olaf-vom	thank you.
2009-07-31T22:08:00.000Z	olaf-vom	Besogon	NIS is Unix-oriented. Samba can also be brought into the picture, especially if you have a Windows Domain Controller and want to use these users ...
2009-07-31T22:10:00.000Z	olaf-vom	Besogon	I haven't updated this for several years anymore, however, I wrote lots of details on LDAP-based users on Debian some while ago ... perhaps there's some info you could use here or there: http://home.subnet.at/~max/ldap/index.php
2009-07-31T22:10:00.000Z	Besogon	olaf-vom	Wow! What do you use to display network by?
2009-07-31T22:12:00.000Z	olaf-vom	Besogon	sorry - can you rephrase please? (do you mean name resolution -> IPs?)
2009-07-31T22:13:00.000Z	Besogon	olaf-vom	In Windows I see network through Explorer and What you use
2009-07-31T22:15:00.000Z	olaf-vom	Besogon	:) ... to be honest, I've stopped concentrating on the network admin area before this became too annoying for me to find some tool. And I can't remember those that I 've tried. (Most of the time, I only had a few shares back then and was OK with mounting/unmounting them, basically manually.) Sorry, no idea - but I'm sure there are good tools out there...
2009-07-31T22:16:00.000Z	olaf-vom	Besogon	at the moment, I use Linux at home - but I have no network there...
2009-07-31T22:17:00.000Z	Besogon	olaf-vom	Look at that http://library.gnome.org/users/user-guide/stable/nautilus-accessnetwork.html.en (ubuntu nautilus don't display NFS)
2009-07-31T22:19:00.000Z	olaf-vom	Besogon	ah, ok, thanks.
2009-07-31T22:20:00.000Z	olaf-vom	Besogon	network:/// works like charm, at least on the locally installed Samba ;)
2009-07-31T22:26:00.000Z	Besogon	olaf-vom	no argue to you
2009-07-31T22:33:00.000Z	olaf-vom	Besogon	need to leave for now -- bye and have fun with all this network-stuff ... (it's a pitty I don't have the time to pursue this anymore :) ...)
