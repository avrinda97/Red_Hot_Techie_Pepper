2010-07-21T08:31:00.000Z	peepingtom	b1nd3r	I think it's a linux-image .deb, ill chek
2010-07-21T08:32:00.000Z	b1nd3r	peepingtom	it doesn't have initrd, I think its made when installing linux-image

2010-07-21T08:36:00.000Z	b1nd3r	peepingtom	I don't know if you have a fast link, but can't you upload your initrd.lz to me?
2010-07-21T08:37:00.000Z	b1nd3r	peepingtom	well, I will not keep the modules anyway, just want to get the full sctructure and scripts
2010-07-21T08:38:00.000Z	b1nd3r	peepingtom	I think it will be usefull
2010-07-21T08:39:00.000Z	b1nd3r	peepingtom	I mean: /boot/initrd.lz
2010-07-21T08:40:00.000Z	b1nd3r	peepingtom	any kernel build will serve
2010-07-21T08:40:00.000Z	b1nd3r	peepingtom	I will fit my own kernel inside it =)
2010-07-21T08:42:00.000Z	peepingtom	b1nd3r	I only compile the odd thing, you mean upload a compressed /boot/initrd.img-2.6.32-23-generic to megaupload or rapidshare     or do you need a different file?
2010-07-21T08:43:00.000Z	b1nd3r	peepingtom	yes, this will serve, rapidshare, 4shared or megaupload will be fine, can you do that for me? will be very helpfull
2010-07-21T08:45:00.000Z	b1nd3r	peepingtom	okay, no problem I will gladly wait =) thanks
