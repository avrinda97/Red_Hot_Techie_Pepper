2007-05-31T09:26:00.000Z	razorbuzz		Hi there.  I'm having a heck of a time linking an SMB share since the kernel upgrade to 2.6.20 the other day.  "ln -s smb://meumo/Music ~/Desktop/Music"  is now throwing the error "No such file or directory" (but I can browse to it through Nautilus with the same directory path).
2007-05-31T09:27:00.000Z	razorbuzz		I've chased a few possible solutions, but to no avail. Went so far as playing with cifs to see if that would work, but no-go
2007-05-31T09:27:00.000Z	rolnyzx	razorbuzz	the smb:// only woks in nautilus
2007-05-31T09:28:00.000Z	razorbuzz	rolnyzx	 Mount throws the same error.  I tried smbmnt (part of smbfs), but to no avail their either
2007-05-31T09:29:00.000Z	razorbuzz	rolnyzx	smbmount gives me the error "ERRDOS - ERRnoaccess. Session setup failed."
2007-05-31T09:30:00.000Z	rolnyzx	razorbuzz	and anyways, you are trying to make a link from your linux box in to the win box so you can browse your linux box in your winbox. That's not the way to do it
2007-05-31T09:31:00.000Z	razorbuzz	rolnyzx	No...I'm actually trying to make a link from the winbox to the Linux box so I can get rhythymbox to open it as a directory since it doesn't have the ability to grab it natively from SMB
2007-05-31T09:31:00.000Z	razorbuzz		If I were going the other way, I'd simply map the network drive in Windows to the UNC of the linux box
2007-05-31T09:31:00.000Z	rolnyzx	razorbuzz	where is rhythmbox in your winbox or in your linuxbox
2007-05-31T09:32:00.000Z	razorbuzz		My linux box
2007-05-31T09:34:00.000Z	razorbuzz	rolnyzx	 There actually is not a winbox..they're both running Ubuntu, I was just unsuccessful getting NFS setup due to duplicate users on both machines.  The server is a webserver and my user has no shell access, so NFS was complaining about permissions I wasn't willing to change.  And on my laptop, I prefer to use the same username
2007-05-31T09:38:00.000Z	rolnyzx	razorbuzz	what i would do is mount your share with smbmount
2007-05-31T09:38:00.000Z	razorbuzz	rolnyzx	It throws the error I mentioned previously
2007-05-31T09:39:00.000Z	rolnyzx	razorbuzz	what do you write on terminal
2007-05-31T09:39:00.000Z	razorbuzz		smbmount //meumo/Music ~/Desktop/music/
2007-05-31T09:41:00.000Z	rolnyzx	razorbuzz	what about username and password
2007-05-31T09:41:00.000Z	razorbuzz	rolnyzx	None necessary
2007-05-31T09:42:00.000Z	rolnyzx	razorbuzz	sudo
2007-05-31T09:43:00.000Z	razorbuzz	rolnyzx	btdt, still doesn't work. Same error.
2007-05-31T09:43:00.000Z	razorbuzz		smbmount was chmod'd to u+s anyway
2007-05-31T09:45:00.000Z	rolnyzx	razorbuzz	sudo apt-get install smbfs
2007-05-31T09:46:00.000Z	razorbuzz	rolnyzx	Already did..that's why smbmount/smbmnt/smbumount are installed and in place
2007-05-31T09:46:00.000Z	rolnyzx	razorbuzz	i would try again
2007-05-31T09:46:00.000Z	razorbuzz	rolnyzx	I have..multiple times.
