2012-10-16T16:27:00.000Z	davidguard		wals_: unfortunately when I insert a livecd I'm not given the option to boot from it. I don't know what is preventing it from booting. I just thought it could be /root being full because it appears to be and before it crashed I got messages about not being able to mount an external hard drive due to a partition being full. (The external hard drive has 60GB free).
2012-10-16T16:28:00.000Z	rsser	davidguard	did you make settings on bios?
2012-10-16T16:29:00.000Z	davidguard	rsser	yes. I'm running a dual boot on a Macbook Pro. So it is probably something to do with that.
2012-10-16T16:30:00.000Z	davidguard	rsser	I mean the dual boot might be why I can't run a liveCD. I used to be able to until the last time I upgraded. Now I can't
2012-10-16T16:32:00.000Z	rsser	davidguard	but the your bios settings can be the problem.
2012-10-16T16:32:00.000Z	davidguard	rsser	yeah I know. I've set my bios to boot from USB then CD then the hard drive.
2012-10-16T16:34:00.000Z	rsser	davidguard	so?
2012-10-16T16:34:00.000Z	davidguard	rsser	with the dual boot screen normally see a CD image I can choose from. But that doesnt come up anymore.
2012-10-16T16:35:00.000Z	davidguard	rsser	it won't boot from liveCDs or live USBs
2012-10-16T16:35:00.000Z	rsser	davidguard	if you choose the cd to start on bios, it shouldn't show the dual boot menu. It will show to you boot menu from live CD only.
2012-10-16T16:36:00.000Z	davidguard	rsser	but it doesn't
2012-10-16T16:37:00.000Z	davidguard	rsser	I can't tell you why or how. The Live CD I used worked previously and still works on other machines. And so did the live USB I have
2012-10-16T16:38:00.000Z	rsser	davidguard	give your mac model
2012-10-16T16:39:00.000Z	davidguard	rsser	MacBookPro3,1
2012-10-16T16:41:00.000Z	davidguard	rsser	I've looked through the forums regarding this issue when I upgraded to Ubuntu 12.04. In the end I gave up and did an upgrade. I don't like doing upgrades. I usually install the newest version. But that time I couldn't. System's been buggy ever since.
2012-10-16T16:43:00.000Z	rsser	davidguard	in your case, it's good to follow official tutorials
2012-10-16T16:43:00.000Z	davidguard	rsser	tutorials for what?
2012-10-16T16:45:00.000Z	davidguard	rsser	I don't know what the problem is. I know the symptom is that it stalls after the ubuntu logo comes up and a series of messages come up the last of which is something about cups but that has [ok] next to it. Then it stops booting.
2012-10-16T16:47:00.000Z	rsser	davidguard	macbook pro is prepare to run macOSX system, you should look on the bios and to set the option to run system non macOSX
2012-10-16T16:56:00.000Z	rsser	davidguard	pvt me
