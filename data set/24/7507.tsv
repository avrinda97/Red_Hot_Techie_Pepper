2005-05-06T06:02:00.000Z	neighborlee	eruin	is this actually being considered ? ;-)
2005-05-06T06:03:00.000Z	neighborlee	eruin	true
2005-05-06T06:03:00.000Z	eruin	neighborlee	it's being considered as far as I know - looks like it judging from the wiki, but I haven't seen much traffic on the matter on the list
2005-05-06T06:03:00.000Z	neighborlee	eruin	gotcha
2005-05-06T06:13:00.000Z	neighborlee	eruin	I'd ditto that
2005-05-06T06:13:00.000Z	neighborlee	eruin	agreed
2005-05-06T06:14:00.000Z	neighborlee	eruin	i'd be much more tempted by linpsire if not for the mess you can get into with apt LOL
2005-05-06T06:14:00.000Z	neighborlee	eruin	granted "I" am not their target audience /-))
2005-05-06T06:15:00.000Z	eruin	neighborlee	I do like their installer though
2005-05-06T06:15:00.000Z	neighborlee	eruin	yeah ..simple and effective like d-i ( although I can't wait for a gtk-fb version)
