2008-01-25T08:09:00.000Z	cybermad		I have very big problem with openoffice.org (use 2.2 and 2.3) on Feisty & Gutsy, i don't know the problem is specific to openoffice.org or ubuntu, so i have file/document server use Microsoft Windows 2003 Server, then i mount the shared folder with this command on /etc/fstab: //172.16.0.100/Tour /mnt/Tour cifs username=operation02,password=123456,auto,users,uid=mike,gid=users,file_mode=0644 0 0. Ok, the problem is when there is document on server *.odt,
2008-01-25T08:09:00.000Z	cybermad		which is i use SAMBA - cifs) or Windows 2003 Server problem. But user on XP or Windows 2000 Pro and ofcourse use OpenOffice.org not complain about that problem. FYI: I tested with OO.org Calc on ubuntu, then save it to XLS (Microsoft Excel format) and it's fine.. so the only problem is OO.org Writer on Ubuntu
2008-01-25T08:10:00.000Z	dehspehl	cybermad	is /mnt/Tour really mounted? the syntax looks odd
2008-01-25T08:12:00.000Z	dehspehl	cybermad	type mount, is /mnt/Tour in the list
2008-01-25T08:12:00.000Z	cybermad	dehspehl	1st.. thanks for help.. i will follow your guide / help
2008-01-25T08:13:00.000Z	dehspehl	cybermad	It is in fact on the list? then it's probably OO.o problem
2008-01-25T08:14:00.000Z	dehspehl	cybermad	yes or no question
2008-01-25T08:18:00.000Z	cybermad	dehspehl	this what i got on mount: //172.168.100.200/Tour on /mnt/Tour type cifs (rw,mand,noexec,nosuid,nodev)
2008-01-25T08:18:00.000Z	cybermad	dehspehl	are you there?
2008-01-25T08:18:00.000Z	dehspehl	cybermad	okay, are you running OO.o as the same user as just copying?
2008-01-25T08:19:00.000Z	dehspehl	cybermad	and have you done the copy with command line 'cp'?
2008-01-25T08:19:00.000Z	cybermad	dehspehl	what do you mean copying file?
2008-01-25T08:20:00.000Z	dehspehl	cybermad	how do you get the file from local to remote?
2008-01-25T08:20:00.000Z	dehspehl	cybermad	what happens when you save odt to doc in somewhere like home?
2008-01-25T08:20:00.000Z	cybermad	dehspehl	i open icon like harddrive on desktop
2008-01-25T08:21:00.000Z	cybermad	dehspehl	if i save the odt to doc in ubuntu environment, then it's ok.. nothing corrupt
2008-01-25T08:21:00.000Z	dehspehl	cybermad	error or "not on the server"?
2008-01-25T08:21:00.000Z	dehspehl	cybermad	very, very odd
2008-01-25T08:22:00.000Z	cybermad	dehspehl	have you test it.. i test it on about 6 computers here
2008-01-25T08:22:00.000Z	dehspehl	cybermad	honestly I don't have anything to test it -with-
2008-01-25T08:22:00.000Z	dehspehl	cybermad	I'd have to buy a windows professional license or something crazy like that to match your environment
2008-01-25T08:24:00.000Z	dehspehl	cybermad	well connection is ruled out, I have yet to have a problem with KIO shared folders
2008-01-25T08:24:00.000Z	dehspehl	cybermad	don't, unless you actually know unix
