2007-05-11T10:01:00.000Z	gglser	LjL	allright
2007-05-11T10:06:00.000Z	LjL	gglser	i think i've missed the part where "transmission" is available as a package
2007-05-11T10:07:00.000Z	gglser	LjL	defrysk : sudo apt-get transmission E: Invalid operation transmission
2007-05-11T10:07:00.000Z	LjL	gglser	THERE IS NO transmission package.
2007-05-11T10:07:00.000Z	LjL	gglser	also, it's "sudo apt-get install <package>", not "sudo apt-get <package>"
2007-05-11T10:08:00.000Z	gglser	LjL	sorry read it wrong, thought you said there was
2007-05-11T10:08:00.000Z	LjL	gglser	well, as others are saying, there might be one on getdeb.net (which is, however, entirely unsupported)
2007-05-11T10:08:00.000Z	LjL	gglser	the error during configure is why you should install "build-essential"
2007-05-11T10:12:00.000Z	LjL	gglser	dpkg doesn't handle dependencies
2007-05-11T10:12:00.000Z	LjL	gglser	then install it. or use the darn gdebi
2007-05-11T10:13:00.000Z	gglser	LjL	got error with package instller as well, let me paste
2007-05-11T10:13:00.000Z	gglser	LjL	defrysk: says, your PC has broken dependencies
2007-05-12T16:12:00.000Z	LjL	gglser	well no, for something like TeX you'd definitely need windows.
2007-05-12T16:12:00.000Z	gglser	LjL	lol
2007-05-12T16:12:00.000Z	LjL	gglser	what's the problem with getting TeX running?
2007-05-12T16:13:00.000Z	gglser	LjL	still have to try
2007-05-12T16:13:00.000Z	gglser	LjL	wanted to see if anyone had suggestions with what was better to isntall
2007-05-12T16:14:00.000Z	gglser	LjL	on the latex website it says: Your system distribution or vendor has probably provided a TeX system including LaTeX. Check your usual software source for a TeX package.
2007-05-12T16:16:00.000Z	LjL	gglser	the basic package is tetex-bin i think. not a heavy tex user at all here
2007-05-12T16:16:00.000Z	gglser	LjL	allright
2007-05-12T16:25:00.000Z	gglser	LjL	wow thanks
