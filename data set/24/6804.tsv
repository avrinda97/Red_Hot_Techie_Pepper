2005-07-11T11:22:00.000Z	harold_		How long can you keep a PowerBook running Ubuntu on before it gets too hot?
2005-07-11T11:23:00.000Z	nalioth	harold_	your PB should never get hot
2005-07-11T11:24:00.000Z	harold_	nalioth	So I can keep it on, theoretically, forever?
2005-07-11T11:24:00.000Z	nalioth	harold_	yes, theoretically
2005-07-11T11:25:00.000Z	harold_	nalioth	This PowerBook line runs notoriously hot.  (The joke is that you could cook an egg on its belly.)
2005-07-11T11:26:00.000Z	harold_	nalioth	What's your slowest laptop?
2005-07-11T11:26:00.000Z	nalioth	harold_	a iBook G3/600
2005-07-11T11:26:00.000Z	harold_	nalioth	What's been your slowest with Linux?
2005-07-11T11:27:00.000Z	nalioth	harold_	dual cpu intel 400mhz
2005-07-11T11:27:00.000Z	harold_	nalioth	LOL, that was you slowest?  I'm on 233MHz
2005-07-11T11:28:00.000Z	nalioth	harold_	i don't shop at goodwill
2005-07-11T11:28:00.000Z	harold_	nalioth	LOL
2005-07-11T11:28:00.000Z	harold_	nalioth	I lucked out finding this PowerBook there; I'd been looking for one for a while
2005-07-11T11:30:00.000Z	harold_	nalioth	What?
2005-07-11T11:30:00.000Z	harold_	nalioth	What does Amaranth do?
2005-07-11T11:30:00.000Z	nalioth	harold_	Amaranth is an op
2005-07-11T11:30:00.000Z	harold_	nalioth	Ah, i had a feeling.
2005-07-11T11:40:00.000Z	nalioth	harold_	start typing a nick, and tab-complete it
2005-07-11T11:58:00.000Z	nalioth	harold_	'discus'
2005-07-11T11:58:00.000Z	harold_	nalioth	coolness
2005-07-12T13:11:00.000Z	harold_	nalioth	Still, i can access the CD while the powerbook is networked to the other computer with the CD drive.
2005-07-12T13:11:00.000Z	nalioth	harold_	then proceed with apt-cdrom goodness
2005-07-12T13:11:00.000Z	harold_	nalioth	LOL, I'll proceed with that good voodoo
2005-07-12T13:21:00.000Z	nalioth	harold_	you are ghosting
