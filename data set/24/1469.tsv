2010-03-26T22:27:00.000Z	Gieke		can you do something like you can do in alt+F2 on startup
2010-03-26T22:27:00.000Z	Gieke		(instead of typing it in alt+F2, doing it automaticly)
2010-03-26T22:28:00.000Z	Gieke		nothing...
2010-03-26T22:28:00.000Z	Gieke		now, i press alt+F2 and enter a command
2010-03-26T22:28:00.000Z	Gieke		i want the command to be executed on startup
2010-03-26T22:28:00.000Z	maginot	Gieke	I can't see any sense on your question...
2010-03-26T22:29:00.000Z	maginot	Gieke	how do you spected to run any command on login screen without ever been logged as an user?
2010-03-26T22:29:00.000Z	maginot	Gieke	you're saying that you want to alt+f2 to show on your login screen, isn't that right?
2010-03-26T22:30:00.000Z	maginot	Gieke	you just want to some custom command to run after login??
2010-03-26T22:31:00.000Z	maginot	Gieke	are you using gnome?
2010-03-26T22:32:00.000Z	maginot	Gieke	go to the gnome menu, open preferences, and open session applications
2010-03-26T22:32:00.000Z	maginot	Gieke	^
2010-03-26T22:33:00.000Z	maginot	Gieke	just a sec, I will get the right name
2010-03-26T22:33:00.000Z	maginot	Gieke	open this and put what you want there: gnome-session-properties
2010-03-26T22:34:00.000Z	Gieke	maginot	the right name is "startup applications"
2010-03-26T22:36:00.000Z	Gieke	maginot	it is  there, do i have to reboot or is there a command to start the startup applications
2010-03-26T22:36:00.000Z	maginot	Gieke	just close and open you X session again
2010-03-26T22:37:00.000Z	maginot	Gieke	close your session and login again
2010-03-26T22:38:00.000Z	maginot	Gieke	so you command is wrong, can I ask what you're trying to do?
2010-03-26T22:39:00.000Z	maginot	Gieke	okay, smb is just the protocol, you want to stabilish a connection, open nautilus automaticly, or what?
2010-03-26T22:42:00.000Z	maginot	Gieke	if you want to have a share for you user its easier to use /etc/fstab for that just keep it for the user you want. But you have to realize the smb:// isn't a command, so will not work.
2010-03-26T22:42:00.000Z	Gieke	maginot	it tried fstab, i failed
2010-03-26T22:44:00.000Z	maginot	Gieke	forget alt+f2 for a moment, you will not do like you do there. Well, you put on the command of startup aplication smb://.... but in front of that put nautilus, like nautilus smb://...
2010-03-26T22:47:00.000Z	maginot	Gieke	sure, now you have a command been executed ;D
