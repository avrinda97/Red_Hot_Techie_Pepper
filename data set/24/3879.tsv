2007-11-20T08:47:00.000Z	sethk	jawee_	then it's almost certainly either a bad download or a bad burn
2007-11-20T08:47:00.000Z	jawee_	sethk	I've tried every single version of Ubuntu since 5.04
2007-11-20T08:47:00.000Z	jawee_	sethk	and other distros work fine
2007-11-20T08:48:00.000Z	sethk	jawee_	that's extremely odd.  One thing I always tell people is never to buy from Dell, for just this sort of reason.  Not just with linux, there is _always_ a problem with a Dell
2007-11-20T08:48:00.000Z	sethk	jawee_	are the successful ones and this one burned in the same burner by the same program?
2007-11-20T08:48:00.000Z	jawee_	sethk	It works fine on my Dell. This is an emachines
2007-11-20T08:48:00.000Z	sethk	jawee_	I don't like them either  :)
2007-11-20T08:49:00.000Z	sethk	jawee_	that's the machine that blows hot air _at_ the processor instead of away from it.  :)
2007-11-20T08:49:00.000Z	jawee_	sethk	This particular CD was burnt with k3b. I've also tried ones from shipit and windows
2007-11-20T08:49:00.000Z	sethk	jawee_	what I'm asking is whether it is manufactured CDs that work and, possibly, burned ones that do not
2007-11-20T08:49:00.000Z	sethk	jawee_	I have seen that happen with certain hardware
2007-11-20T08:49:00.000Z	jawee_	sethk	Which is why I am trying Smart Boot Manager now...
2007-11-20T08:50:00.000Z	sethk	jawee_	ok
2007-11-20T08:50:00.000Z	jawee_	sethk	But now its just throwing an error
2007-11-20T08:50:00.000Z	sethk	jawee_	sounds like you've already tried all the obvious things, but, you know, we don't know that until we ask
2007-11-20T08:50:00.000Z	sethk	jawee_	what's the error?
2007-11-20T08:50:00.000Z	jawee_	sethk	I'm getting the error "Disk error! 0xAA" when I select CD0
2007-11-20T08:51:00.000Z	sethk	jawee_	this is some kind of hardware issue.  Make sure you don't have an IDE drive hooked up like an EIDE drive.
2007-11-20T08:51:00.000Z	sethk	jawee_	make sure you don't have a CS jumper and a master or slave jumper on the same IDE cable
2007-11-20T08:51:00.000Z	jawee_	sethk	Well, this drive can't burn CD's anymore
2007-11-20T08:52:00.000Z	jawee_	sethk	I will check out the setup. If nothing else I can find another drive to swap it with
2007-11-20T08:52:00.000Z	sethk	jawee_	I'd replace the drive.  I know that's somewhat illogical, since other CDs boot, but I think it will work.
2007-11-20T08:52:00.000Z	jawee_	sethk	I'll see what happends :D
2007-11-20T08:52:00.000Z	sethk	jawee_	yes, that's advisable especially if you have some around
