2009-07-31T10:04:00.000Z	ultraz	deexannihilate	i assume your madwifi drivers are broken for your WiFi which have Atheros chipset. You should try reinstalling madwifi drivers. I am sorry but i cant open the linke you provided to me, my console browser (links2) probably cant open it.
2009-07-31T10:05:00.000Z	ultraz	deexannihilate	what was that guide for?
2009-07-31T10:13:00.000Z	deexannihilate	ultraz	it was to fix the known wifi issues.. it goes in and out

2009-07-31T10:14:00.000Z	deexannihilate	ultraz	I don't remember the specific issue, but it was unsuccessful
2009-07-31T10:18:00.000Z	deexannihilate	ultraz	yesterday, i copied the madwifi driver from my desktop and tried to transfer it to the netbook
2009-07-31T10:26:00.000Z	deexannihilate	ultraz	if I just reload remix, do you think it will fix the problem?

2009-07-31T10:36:00.000Z	deexannihilate	ultraz	if I completely reinstall linux, do you think it will solve the problem?
2009-07-31T10:37:00.000Z	ultraz	deexannihilate	well, if you had working system ... then i would say it would.
2009-07-31T10:39:00.000Z	deexannihilate	ultraz	is there anyway to fix it?
2009-07-31T10:40:00.000Z	ultraz	deexannihilate	as i said, i cant help you now since i cant open that link with links2 ... i have no access to GUI right now. I cant help you until i see what you did. Maybe somebody else can help you.
