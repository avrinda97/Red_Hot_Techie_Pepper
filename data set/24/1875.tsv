2009-07-12T08:32:00.000Z	ctmjr	watson516	can you explain alittle more about does not work?
2009-07-12T08:33:00.000Z	watson516	ctmjr	I open up the 'Hardware Drivers' tool in 8.10, select the recommended display driver and it downloads it (sometimes) but doesn't seem to install
2009-07-12T08:34:00.000Z	watson516	ctmjr	After I do this and restart the x, it will come up with an error along the lines that the x wouldn't start up and I get the option to use low res mode or use the default settings
2009-07-12T08:37:00.000Z	ctmjr	watson516	run this in a terminal it will reset xorg to default sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg then reboot your box and what nvidia card do you have?
2009-07-12T08:40:00.000Z	watson516	ctmjr	I actually have no idea what video card I have...its a laptop (compaq presario v3000), I checked the specs on a website and it says Intel 945GM..Is that any help?
2009-07-12T08:42:00.000Z	ctmjr	watson516	we need to be sure run this lspci | grep VGA it more than likely is that
2009-07-12T08:43:00.000Z	watson516	ctmjr	00:05.0 VGA compatible controller: nVidia Corporation C51 [Geforce 6150 Go] (rev a2)
2009-07-12T08:44:00.000Z	ctmjr	watson516	so you do have an nvidia not intel
2009-07-12T08:46:00.000Z	ctmjr	watson516	when you ran the ubuntu restricted driver app you got no errors?
2009-07-12T08:47:00.000Z	watson516	ctmjr	No
2009-07-12T08:51:00.000Z	ctmjr	watson516	run this and see if you get an error nvidia-settings are you running in low graphics mode now or terminal?
2009-07-12T08:53:00.000Z	watson516	ctmjr	When I ran that it errored: You do not appear to be using the NVIDIA X driver. Please edit your X configuration file (just run nvidia-xconfig as root), and restart the X server
2009-07-12T08:53:00.000Z	watson516	ctmjr	When I run that command I get another error saying somethine along the lines of a line in my config file is missing
2009-07-12T08:54:00.000Z	watson516	ctmjr	I reset it to default so its running normal, not low res or text
2009-07-12T08:56:00.000Z	watson516	ctmjr	If I close the xserver and sh a .run driver file for nvidia and then restart the xserver, would that work?
2009-07-12T08:57:00.000Z	ctmjr	watson516	try this first  this gksu gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf and under device it should say either configured driver or vesa if it says vesa change it to nvidia if not put this in there    Driver       "nvidia"
2009-07-12T08:59:00.000Z	watson516	ctmjr	All it said under the Device section was Identifier      "Configured Video Device"
2009-07-12T09:00:00.000Z	watson516	ctmjr	I added the driver line, shall I restart xserver and hope for the best?
2009-07-12T09:00:00.000Z	ctmjr	watson516	yes
2009-07-12T09:01:00.000Z	watson516	ctmjr	Okay, thanks for the help. Muchly appreciated. Have a great night (if it doesn't work, I shall continue on it tomorrow). Thanks.
