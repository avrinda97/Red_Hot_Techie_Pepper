2011-04-01T01:51:00.000Z	myrmidette		ok
2011-04-01T01:51:00.000Z	myrmidette		but it's still configured
2011-04-01T01:52:00.000Z	myrmidette		I am
2011-04-01T01:53:00.000Z	myrmidette		oh wait, there is a cable, but it's not connected to anything
2011-04-01T01:53:00.000Z	myrmidette		btw I'm using 10.10
2011-04-01T01:53:00.000Z	myrmidette		pretty damn good
2011-04-01T01:54:00.000Z	myrmidette		yes
2011-04-01T01:56:00.000Z	myrmidette		but the cable is not connected to a modem or router, there's no circuit
2011-04-01T01:56:00.000Z	myrmidette		how can it detect anything?
2011-04-01T01:57:00.000Z	meganerdca	myrmidette	bad driver
2011-04-01T01:57:00.000Z	myrmidette	meganerdca	good driver
2011-04-01T01:57:00.000Z	meganerdca	myrmidette	what do you get when you type "ip addr"
2011-04-01T02:01:00.000Z	meganerdca	myrmidette	it is saying that there the link is down on eth0
2011-04-01T02:01:00.000Z	myrmidette	meganerdca	yes. there's no cable in the ethernet port
2011-04-01T02:03:00.000Z	meganerdca	myrmidette	so you can't connect via wifi?  Did I understand the problem correctly?
2011-04-01T02:04:00.000Z	myrmidette	meganerdca	 but it seems to prefer the (nonexistent) eth0 connection to the working wifi connection
2011-04-01T02:06:00.000Z	meganerdca	myrmidette	any rougue routing entries?  "ip route" will show the routes, more than one default is bad unless you specifically set it up
2011-04-01T02:07:00.000Z	meganerdca	myrmidette	are they on the same subnet, with different devices?
2011-04-01T02:07:00.000Z	meganerdca	myrmidette	well, without sudo this is going to be a problem, but normally "sudo ip route del default via dev eth0"
2011-04-01T02:08:00.000Z	meganerdca	myrmidette	I don't suppose there is a root account enabled on this machine that you have a password for?
2011-04-01T02:09:00.000Z	meganerdca	myrmidette	you will need need root or sudo access to remove the offending route
2011-04-01T02:09:00.000Z	meganerdca	myrmidette	"sudo ip route del default via dev eth0"
2011-04-01T02:09:00.000Z	meganerdca	myrmidette	this will leave only the route for device wlan0 in the routing table
2011-04-01T02:10:00.000Z	meganerdca	myrmidette	your welcome
