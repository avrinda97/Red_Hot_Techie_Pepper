2012-02-06T03:58:00.000Z	StephenHawking		Hey guys, experienced user here.  I'm running 9.10, I DONT wanna hear "upgrade, its so old" etc.  I'm sticking with 9.10 on this box because certain software just wont work otherwise, among other issues.
2012-02-06T03:59:00.000Z	StephenHawking		My issue though, is I have a broadcom chipset that normally uses the b43 chipset, sometimes the hardware switch can be wonky, and will require a reboot to get working
2012-02-06T04:00:00.000Z	StephenHawking		So I plugged in my GNexus android and did a usb tehter which works, i can surf the web.  But when i run apt-get update i get tons of errors
2012-02-06T04:00:00.000Z	StephenHawking		Like it can't connect to the server
2012-02-06T04:00:00.000Z	StephenHawking		Even when I uncomment other repos
2012-02-06T04:01:00.000Z	StephenHawking		It appears the b43 driver is installed though, cause networkmanager says "disconnected" rather than "missing firmware"
2012-02-06T04:01:00.000Z	StephenHawking		So I can continue to use 9.10
2012-02-06T04:02:00.000Z	StephenHawking		And no I DO NOT want to upgrade
2012-02-06T04:02:00.000Z	StephenHawking		we've already gotten that far
2012-02-06T04:03:00.000Z	Flannel	StephenHawking	http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ but again, it's EOL, you're at risk, not supported, yadda yadda.
2012-02-06T04:03:00.000Z	StephenHawking		thanks
2012-02-06T04:03:00.000Z	StephenHawking	Flannel	it cant be any worse than running Arch using the testing repo for the past 6+ years
2012-02-06T04:04:00.000Z	Flannel	StephenHawking	I'm not familiar with Arch, but the problem is security vulnerabilities that aren't patched, not necessarily general 'bugs'
2012-02-06T04:05:00.000Z	StephenHawking	Flannel	that relaly isnt a problem to me, and i said earlier, 9.10 is the only one that will work with a certain app i need
2012-02-06T04:05:00.000Z	StephenHawking		So replacing most of the url with that old-releases url SHOULD work?
2012-02-06T04:05:00.000Z	StephenHawking		Or could comeone give me an example?
2012-02-06T04:05:00.000Z	StephenHawking		Because some work, some dont
2012-02-06T04:06:00.000Z	StephenHawking		nvm, i found plenty of wbesites addressing the problem
2012-02-06T04:06:00.000Z	StephenHawking		I broke my number one rule!
2012-02-06T04:06:00.000Z	StephenHawking		Aleways google before aksing in #ubuntu
2012-02-06T04:06:00.000Z	Flannel	StephenHawking	archives.ubuntu.com/ubuntu (and security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu) with old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu
2012-02-06T04:06:00.000Z	StephenHawking		lol
2012-02-06T04:07:00.000Z	StephenHawking	Flannel	i got it
