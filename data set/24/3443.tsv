2011-08-09T17:40:00.000Z	Tophen		Ok. I'll be storing large games and stuff.
2011-08-09T17:41:00.000Z	Tophen		Will I be able to transfer games from windows onto linux?
2011-08-09T17:42:00.000Z	Tophen		But if I use Play on Linux?
2011-08-09T17:42:00.000Z	Tophen		I'm only gonna be on Steam Games, which are supported.
2011-08-09T17:43:00.000Z	Tophen		Yeah i know.
2011-08-09T17:43:00.000Z	Tophen		But I don't have a choice.
2011-08-09T17:44:00.000Z	Tophen		I'm on a macbook that we get given at school.
2011-08-09T17:44:00.000Z	Tophen		Alright, I'll reprashe my quesiton with more detail.
2011-08-09T17:46:00.000Z	Tophen		I am on a MacBook that was given to us by our school. For reasons, I cannot access steam on Windows. I am running Linux off a disc. I'm planning on burning a new boot disc to boot it up, and I want to use my 500gb EXT HD to store my files. I am hoping that I will be able to run Steam Games on Play on Linux (I was told numerous times that it was easily done {I just want to play source games [definetely work]})
2011-08-09T17:47:00.000Z	Tophen		My question is: What fs should I format my 500gb external hard drive to if I want to transfer games between windows and linux.
2011-08-09T17:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Tophen	NTFS
2011-08-09T17:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Tophen	windows is dumb and can't access too many file systems
2011-08-09T17:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Tophen	format it to NTFS in Windows.Much easier
2011-08-09T17:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Tophen	make a small partition to hold ubuntu (about 20Gb is plenty) then use the rest as NTFS
2011-08-09T17:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Tophen	you will have a button at boot to select the booting device
2011-08-09T17:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Tophen	right at the very VERY beginning of powerup
2011-08-09T18:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Tophen	some will run, soe won't
2011-08-09T18:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Tophen	then use Ubuntu oly :)
2011-08-09T18:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Tophen	only ;) typo
2011-08-09T18:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Tophen	sup?
2011-08-09T18:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Tophen	yes but install it only to a portion of the available space so that you can install ubuntu to the remaining space. The default is 100% which you don't want
2011-08-09T18:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Tophen	are you installing the games in Linux or WIndows?
2011-08-09T18:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Tophen	then you'd need to look at the space used by the games then add some space for other junk. The Ubuntu OS is very small compared to fat dumb windows
2011-08-09T18:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Tophen	I'd go 64bit personally
