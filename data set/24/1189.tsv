2010-05-24T22:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Bluelf: if you press ALT+F2 and start typing its name does it complete?
2010-05-24T22:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Bluelf: then i'd run alacarte and make your own entry in the menu as well as log a bug
2010-05-24T22:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Bluelf: once you make the menu entry you can copy it to the desktop if you wish
2010-05-24T22:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Bluelf: ok, launch it from terminal for clues. I don't know the app but I can suggest generic stuff
2010-05-24T22:39:00.000Z	bluelf	ActionParsnip	where does ubuntu software center install apps i m new to linux
2010-05-24T22:42:00.000Z	bluelf	ActionParsnip	this what i get http://pastebin.com/0qiNXPL0
2010-05-24T22:48:00.000Z	bluelf	ActionParsnip	its like keynote , its for presentations
2010-05-24T22:49:00.000Z	bluelf	ActionParsnip	something like power-point just that its from apple
2010-05-24T22:51:00.000Z	bluelf	ActionParsnip	ah its justok , nothing compared to powerpoint 2010 or keynote
2010-07-03T23:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bluelf	i'd ask in #compiz ,its more specific to you issue
2010-10-17T09:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bluelf	being "up to date" means your RELEASE is up to date, it doesn't mean you are on the latest release
2010-10-17T09:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bluelf	karmic was released in 2009 and is still supported and will say "up to date" but isn't maverick
2010-10-17T09:32:00.000Z	bluelf	ActionParsnip	 had already changed release upgrade to normal release but still when I click on check it says that my system is up-to-date..
2010-10-17T09:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bluelf	it's more involved than using apt-get
2010-10-17T09:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bluelf	check the upgrade notes ubottu gave, it has commands to run
2010-10-17T09:33:00.000Z	bluelf	ActionParsnip	ok
2010-10-17T09:34:00.000Z	bluelf	ActionParsnip	it tells me to do same things that I have tried, I tried again nothing happened
2010-10-17T09:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bluelf	sudo apt-get install update-manager-core; sudo do-release-upgrade
2010-10-17T09:47:00.000Z	bluelf	ActionParsnip	thanks :)
2010-10-17T09:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bluelf	all i did was copy the command from the upgrade notes ubottu gave
2010-10-17T09:49:00.000Z	bluelf	ActionParsnip	it was in the section "Network Upgrade for Ubuntu Servers (Recommended)" I tried what was written for Ubuntu Desktops.
2010-10-17T09:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bluelf	the server upgrade just involves tryping stuff as it doesn't have the gui stuff the desktop has
2010-10-17T09:54:00.000Z	bluelf	ActionParsnip	 I dint knew. Typing stuff is much easier..next time i will try server commands first .. thanks
2010-10-17T09:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bluelf	np man, terminal == power :D
