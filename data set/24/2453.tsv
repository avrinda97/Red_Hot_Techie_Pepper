2009-01-15T14:20:00.000Z	dAnjou		Hi ... wouldn'it be nice, if xchat joins automatically #ubuntu (or in my case #ubuntu-de :P) on startup (I mean, without any configuration, after installing ubuntu like in opensuse)?
2009-01-15T14:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dAnjou	pidgin has an autojoin option, maybe xchat does too
2009-01-15T14:21:00.000Z	dAnjou	ActionParsnip	you misunderstood me
2009-01-15T14:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dAnjou	http://xchat.org/faq/#q23
2009-01-15T14:23:00.000Z	dAnjou	ActionParsnip	i said: you missunderstood me
2009-01-15T14:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dAnjou	then wassup?
2009-01-15T14:26:00.000Z	dAnjou	ActionParsnip	my concern was, that xchat should automatically join #ubuntu after a fresh installation of ubuntu without any configuration
2009-01-15T14:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dAnjou	not everybody will want that
2009-01-15T14:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dAnjou	assuming what a user will want to connect to is very rude imho
2009-01-15T14:27:00.000Z	dAnjou	ActionParsnip	it would be easier for beginners
2009-01-15T14:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dAnjou	it could be an install time option maybe
2009-01-15T14:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dAnjou	not really, madriva is pretty user friendly
2009-01-15T14:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dAnjou	and suse is nice for beginners too
2009-01-15T14:28:00.000Z	dAnjou	ActionParsnip	ubuntu want to be for beginners
2009-01-15T14:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dAnjou	i disagree but its offtopic here
2011-06-01T02:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dAnjou	which font
2011-06-01T02:23:00.000Z	dAnjou	ActionParsnip	23:18:50 < dAnjou> hey, i am approved member of the ubuntu font family interest group on launchpad and want to test the monospaced font here on lucid but i can't find it after installing ubuntu-private-fonts.
2011-06-01T02:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dAnjou	its documented on omgubuntu
2011-06-01T02:24:00.000Z	dAnjou	ActionParsnip	well i did, what they say, but it doesn't work. i don't have the font. (keep in mind, i have 10.04 here)
2011-06-01T02:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dAnjou	You can apply to become a beta tester by  joining the Ubuntu Typeface Interest group on Launchpad and waiting to be approved/granted access to the PPA. I'd contact the devs
2011-06-01T02:30:00.000Z	dAnjou	ActionParsnip	did you actually read my question??
2011-06-01T02:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dAnjou	then contact the devs, they are the ones restricting access
2011-06-01T03:08:00.000Z	dAnjou	ActionParsnip	AND use natty
2011-06-01T03:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dAnjou	as you say
