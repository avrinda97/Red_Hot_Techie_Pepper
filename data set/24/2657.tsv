2008-10-14T13:02:00.000Z	Ohmu		Hello everyone!  I'm trying to write a bootable WinXP-CD from Ubuntu.  2 problems. (1) - it won't write to the CD  - problem seems to be that the i386 folder wont copy.  Maybe 6000 files in one folder is more than it can handle.  And (2) I cannot find any mention of a Bootable CD.   How do I make one?
2008-10-14T13:02:00.000Z	jim_p	Ohmu	what burning app do you use? so far only k3b can make bootable cds from 0
2008-10-14T13:04:00.000Z	Ohmu	jim_p	I'm using the standard one that comes with Ubuntu.  thanks...  I'll search for it.
2008-10-14T13:05:00.000Z	jim_p	Ohmu	its a bit tricky even with k3b. the boot catalog thing is hidden. i suggest using isomaster to turn it into an iso and bunt it like an iso. isomaster is far mor convenient

2008-10-29T11:37:00.000Z	jim_p	Ohmu	well the only key on my keyboard that does not work is saying "Files" and its supposed to open "my documents" in xp. all the rest like WWW, Email, Volume +, Mute etc work
2008-10-30T11:38:00.000Z	jim_p	Ohmu	close every app you have there. it could be a seeding torrent up on the background
2008-10-30T11:41:00.000Z	Ohmu	jim_p	thx
2008-12-03T15:27:00.000Z	jim_p	Ohmu	network manager
2008-12-03T15:28:00.000Z	Ohmu	jim_p	yer but what do I do with it?
2008-12-03T15:28:00.000Z	jim_p	Ohmu	remove it and install wicd             wicd.sourceforge.net
2008-12-03T15:30:00.000Z	Ohmu	jim_p	nice.  ok gotta go now - I'll do it when I'm back.  thx.
2008-12-03T15:31:00.000Z	jim_p	Ohmu	lol. ok. do not download the .deb file and double click install. USE THE REPO of wicd to install from apt
2008-12-03T15:33:00.000Z	Ohmu	jim_p	wicked. ok.
2008-12-05T19:46:00.000Z	Ohmu	jim_p	could you help me get a WAP running?  I'm very stuck...
2008-12-05T19:48:00.000Z	jim_p	Ohmu	sure, hit it
2008-12-05T19:50:00.000Z	Ohmu	jim_p	Can I do the whole thing without any GUI stuff?  No network manager, no wicd, etc?
2008-12-05T19:51:00.000Z	jim_p	Ohmu	theoritically, yes. practically... i have tried connecting with wep and it all went wrong
2008-12-05T19:51:00.000Z	jim_p	Ohmu	i could connect if i disabled wep key from the hotspot, but its no use
2008-12-05T19:51:00.000Z	Ohmu	jim_p	I'm not using wep.  I'm going for like a 'hello world' WAP
2008-12-05T19:52:00.000Z	jim_p	Ohmu	wap as in... www for cellphones etc?? i thought of wpa. damn
2008-12-05T19:53:00.000Z	Ohmu	jim_p	I'm trying to get my housemates online
2008-12-05T19:53:00.000Z	Ohmu	jim_p	I have a wifi card.  I had it working in Heron.  But it's broken now I upgraded to Intrepid.
2008-12-05T19:55:00.000Z	jim_p	Ohmu	have you tried disabling nm to see if it works? what model is that card?
