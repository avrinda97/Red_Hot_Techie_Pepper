2005-05-31T11:47:00.000Z	zoro		well hello everyone :)
2005-05-31T11:48:00.000Z	zoro		i have a small question to ask about ubuntu and apt-get
2005-05-31T11:48:00.000Z	zoro		for /etc/apt/sources.list
2005-05-31T11:48:00.000Z	zoro		can i just change "warty" to "hoary" to set it to get updated packages for that distro?
2005-05-31T11:48:00.000Z	zoro		version*
2005-05-31T11:48:00.000Z	nickrud	zoro	yes
2005-05-31T11:49:00.000Z	nickrud	zoro	apt-get dist-upgrade afterwards
2005-05-31T11:49:00.000Z	zoro	nickrud	i tried that - it did nothing but say "no updates available"
2005-05-31T11:49:00.000Z	nickrud	zoro	I mean, apt-get update first, then apt-get dist-upgrade
2005-05-31T11:51:00.000Z	zoro	nickrud	i gathered that ;)
2005-05-31T11:51:00.000Z	nickrud	zoro	;)
2005-05-31T11:51:00.000Z	zoro	nickrud	my problem is that it didnt change the update source for me :)
2005-05-31T11:52:00.000Z	nickrud	zoro	unless someone tells you otherwise, replace sources.list with http://pastebin.com/288853, then update and dist-upgrade
2005-05-31T11:52:00.000Z	zoro	nickrud	the who in the what now? :)
2005-05-31T11:52:00.000Z	nickrud	zoro	smarter people than me who lurk on this list :)
2005-05-31T11:53:00.000Z	zoro	nickrud	ah i see now
2005-05-31T11:53:00.000Z	nickrud	zoro	no one has said no, yet :)
2005-05-31T11:55:00.000Z	zoro	nickrud	:)
2005-05-31T11:55:00.000Z	nickrud	zoro	I put that there so people really look before leaping ;)
2005-05-31T11:56:00.000Z	zoro	nickrud	look before leaping? feck that! i'll put my blindfold on and boldy follow anyone i want to
2005-05-31T11:58:00.000Z	nickrud	zoro	np, I'm on a clean up those bad sources.list kick right now
2005-05-31T11:58:00.000Z	zoro	nickrud	one more thing - would you consider ubuntu suitable for traffic shaping and stuff like that?
2005-05-31T11:58:00.000Z	nickrud	zoro	not a clue, I'm not a network admin
2005-05-31T11:58:00.000Z	zoro	nickrud	cool
