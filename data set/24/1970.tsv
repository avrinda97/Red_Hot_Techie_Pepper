2009-07-19T22:26:00.000Z	TheChuckster		hi! is there a way to repair an ubuntu installation without losing my documents (home directory)? i wasn't smart and i didn't put the home directory on a separate partition like i was supposed to
2009-07-19T22:26:00.000Z	edbian	TheChuckster	Almost definitely!
2009-07-19T22:26:00.000Z	edbian	TheChuckster	Be more specific.  What are you trying to do?
2009-07-19T22:27:00.000Z	edbian	TheChuckster	Do you NEED to reinstall?  What about the system isn't working?
2009-07-19T22:27:00.000Z	edbian	TheChuckster	You're just 1 step ahead of my questions! :)
2009-07-19T22:27:00.000Z	edbian	TheChuckster	So you'd rather try to reinstall than go through fixing the dependencies?  Do you have a live CD on hand?
2009-07-19T22:28:00.000Z	edbian	TheChuckster	The situation you're in is not hopeless.  I can help you get your system working again or I can help you reinstall without losing your data.  Which would you like to do?
2009-07-19T22:29:00.000Z	TheChuckster	edbian	wow thanks for all of the help
2009-07-19T22:29:00.000Z	edbian	TheChuckster	NP! :)
2009-07-19T22:29:00.000Z	edbian	TheChuckster	Thanks
2009-07-19T22:29:00.000Z	edbian	TheChuckster	Please start your posts with my name though so I see them easier.
2009-07-19T22:29:00.000Z	TheChuckster	edbian	well hold tight one sec while i try to repair the updating problem... if i can fix that, then i might be able to avoid reinstalling the entire system
2009-07-19T22:30:00.000Z	TheChuckster	edbian	right now it's running a partial update
2009-07-19T22:30:00.000Z	edbian	TheChuckster	Sure!  Go for the partial update and see what happens
2009-07-19T22:32:00.000Z	TheChuckster	edbian	212 package upgrades :o
2009-07-19T22:33:00.000Z	edbian	TheChuckster	That's gonna take a bit of time huh.  What did you do to get so far behind?  Were you messing with repos?
2009-07-19T22:33:00.000Z	edbian	TheChuckster	On the plus side it sounds like apt-get is in control.
2009-07-19T22:33:00.000Z	edbian	TheChuckster	HA HA HA
2009-07-19T22:34:00.000Z	edbian	TheChuckster	I'm gonna pretend you weren't serious about not upgradeing ;)
2009-07-19T22:34:00.000Z	TheChuckster	edbian	well i was also mesmerized by Windows 7 land for a few months
2009-07-19T22:35:00.000Z	edbian	TheChuckster	Windows Vista <= Windows 7 < Linux
2009-07-19T22:35:00.000Z	TheChuckster	edbian	i play games though :\
2009-07-19T22:36:00.000Z	edbian	TheChuckster	Well for games windows is > linux atm
2009-07-19T22:36:00.000Z	TheChuckster	edbian	yeah blame direct X for vendor lock in
