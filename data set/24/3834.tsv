2008-01-23T10:47:00.000Z	achandrashekar		all right guys i have a tough question to ask....Im okay with my way around a linux box, and can seem to build/put together things, like an asterisk box or a dns server or even a kickstart server...but seem to be hitting a professional snag when finding a job where they require a lot skill when it comes to scripting...i can vi around..but seems like im always falling short. any advice on interviewing better?? like
2008-01-23T10:47:00.000Z	achandrashekar		 stuff will come up sed or awk..but my experiences have me rarely using them.
2008-01-23T10:48:00.000Z	achandrashekar		how is this random chatter its very pertinent
2008-01-23T10:49:00.000Z	achandrashekar		ive contributed so much to this channel helping others...i just thought was kind of rude..
2008-01-23T10:49:00.000Z	bazhang	achandrashekar	not the correct channel for that
2008-01-23T10:50:00.000Z	bazhang	achandrashekar	do you have an issue relating to a ubuntu install? if so this is the place
2008-01-23T10:51:00.000Z	achandrashekar	bazhang	yes Im looking to write a completely automated kickstart script that uses php as a methodlogy to allow me install various operting systems including ubuntu...can you aid?
2008-04-06T22:23:00.000Z	bazhang	achandrashekar	have done so yes; please describe clearly your issues thanks
2008-04-06T22:24:00.000Z	achandrashekar	bazhang	the issue when using the option for live i believe its no "something"...I type that..and the system after a white screen dumps to a prompt
2008-04-06T22:25:00.000Z	achandrashekar	bazhang	I also used the alternate cd
2008-04-06T22:25:00.000Z	achandrashekar	bazhang	and after install from console...just boots up and nothing on the screen. This is true across 6 different systems now.
2008-04-06T22:25:00.000Z	achandrashekar	bazhang	with dapper there is no issue.
2008-04-06T22:27:00.000Z	bazhang	achandrashekar	you type something? not sure what you mean by that--could you clarify please--also what drivers do you have for your video card and what card is it
2008-04-06T22:30:00.000Z	achandrashekar	bazhang	its the standard ati that comes with g4 tower, and the command is live video=ofonly
2008-04-06T22:31:00.000Z	bazhang	achandrashekar	have you removed quiet and watched the exact errors you are getting? that would be very helpful
2008-04-06T22:40:00.000Z	achandrashekar	bazhang	how is that possible...system doesnt even get that far on install...
2008-04-06T22:41:00.000Z	bazhang	achandrashekar	do any ppc distros boot on this computer?
2008-04-06T22:42:00.000Z	achandrashekar	bazhang	yes 6.00 dapper
2008-04-06T22:43:00.000Z	bazhang	achandrashekar	well the ppc is no longer officially supported--it is a community effort now--my question was more along the lines have you tried any other recent ppc distros livecd's on that computer other than ubuntu? yellow dog, etc
2008-04-16T06:19:00.000Z	bazhang	achandrashekar	you want a fresh install? otherwise you need to go from 6.06 to 7.10 with every version in between
2008-04-16T06:20:00.000Z	achandrashekar	bazhang	well..as you might remember...i had the woes with 7.10 install on ppc. 6.06 installs fine on the g4s..and now im thinking upgrade...so how do i go about it exactly...i read some of the how to's but the upgrade manager shows ability to upgrade to 7.10.
2008-04-16T06:21:00.000Z	achandrashekar	bazhang	that was..shows "no" ability..sorry.
2008-04-16T06:24:00.000Z	achandrashekar	bazhang	basically I need to go to 6.10 alternate, then 7.00, then 7.10?
2008-04-16T06:25:00.000Z	bazhang	achandrashekar	6.06--->6.10---->7.04---->7.10
