2010-01-05T06:23:00.000Z	IdleOne	mou	also please try to provide helpful info to other users. things like "it's linux and no one helps" just makes me want to not search and offer you help
2010-01-05T06:24:00.000Z	mou	IdleOne	this is what i see when i login: http://members.wideband.net.au/syborfical/Xvnc.png
2010-01-05T06:32:00.000Z	IdleOne	mou	you are demanding help and as you have been told we are volunteers. not to mention you haven't really asked a proper question
2010-01-05T06:33:00.000Z	IdleOne	mou	complain to them about that
2010-01-05T06:36:00.000Z	IdleOne	mou	did you look at that link I posted for you?

2010-01-05T06:50:00.000Z	IdleOne	mou	so we should have to put up with your foul mouth and bad attitude?
2010-01-05T06:50:00.000Z	mou	IdleOne	its called ignore
2010-01-05T06:51:00.000Z	IdleOne	mou	it's called follow the rules or go away
2010-01-05T06:51:00.000Z	mou	IdleOne	its called help or go to hell
2010-01-05T06:51:00.000Z	IdleOne	mou	honestly I don't care about your issues with linux or with your paid support problems but for the past half hour I have put up with it and it is unfair to the polite users in here who need real help and want it
