2007-04-16T11:08:00.000Z	LordLimeca1		sort of figure, might as well switch to ubuntu, since it handles xp programs better than vista :D
2007-04-16T11:09:00.000Z	LordLimeca1		and has more driver support to boot
2007-04-16T11:09:00.000Z	LordLimeca1		it may just be the lack of opengl?  or crappy drivers?
2007-04-16T11:10:00.000Z	LordLimeca1		or all the DRM checks running in the background?
2007-04-16T11:10:00.000Z	LordLimeca1		test on a non-aero system
2007-04-16T11:10:00.000Z	LordLimeca1		a friend cant even play counterstrike source ---
2007-04-16T11:10:00.000Z	LordLimeca1		-_-
2007-04-16T11:10:00.000Z	LordLimeca1		o.0
2007-04-16T11:10:00.000Z	LordLimeca1		wierd
2007-04-16T11:11:00.000Z	LordLimeca1		well, it MAY be drivers.....
2007-04-16T11:11:00.000Z	Falstius	LordLimeca1	I have vista (and XP, and win2k) in virtual machines just in case I need them.  Switching to linux really is fairly painless.
2007-04-16T11:11:00.000Z	LordLimeca1		a friend cant play CS: source with a 7900 and a amd64
2007-04-16T11:11:00.000Z	LordLimeca1	Falstius	dualboot/virtual machine FTW
2007-04-16T11:11:00.000Z	LordLimeca1		or dualbox
2007-04-16T11:11:00.000Z	LordLimeca1		in vista?
2007-04-16T11:12:00.000Z	Falstius	LordLimeca1	dual boot is an unecessary headache.  with VM, you can alt-tab between operating systems.
2007-04-16T11:12:00.000Z	LordLimeca1	Falstius	vm=overhead tho, and more of a pain to me
2007-04-16T11:12:00.000Z	LordLimeca1		dunno why
2007-04-16T11:12:00.000Z	LordLimeca1		reboots dont really bother me
2007-04-16T11:13:00.000Z	LordLimeca1		i may try VM in feisty tho
2007-04-16T11:13:00.000Z	Falstius	LordLimeca1	well, I don't play games, and its really only video overhead that is a problem (some things like encoders are faster in a VM)
2007-04-16T11:13:00.000Z	LordLimeca1	Falstius	thats pretty much why you would use windows, isnt it
2007-04-16T11:13:00.000Z	LordLimeca1		that, and the paperclip
2007-04-16T11:14:00.000Z	Falstius	LordLimeca1	no, I need office compatibility sometimes, plus the matlab as a student I have is windows only, running MSVC++ (for some projects I inherited), etc.
