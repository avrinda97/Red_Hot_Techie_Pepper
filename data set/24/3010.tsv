2010-04-03T08:58:00.000Z	robertzaccour		brasero always fails to open disc drive after copying a disc. any way to fix it?
2010-04-03T08:58:00.000Z	robertzaccour		i always have to manually eject and then the data is dropped and not saved for the blank disc
2010-04-03T08:59:00.000Z	bazhang	robertzaccour	do other burner software have this issue as well? k3b gnomebaker etc?
2010-04-03T08:59:00.000Z	bazhang	robertzaccour	you mean copy a iso/dvd/cd?
2010-04-03T09:00:00.000Z	robertzaccour	bazhang	yes
2010-04-03T09:00:00.000Z	bazhang	robertzaccour	k9copy can do that afaik
2010-04-03T09:00:00.000Z	robertzaccour	bazhang	oh ok thanks
2010-04-03T09:01:00.000Z	bazhang	robertzaccour	rip to iso? could you clarify please
2010-04-03T09:02:00.000Z	robertzaccour	bazhang	the problem with brasero 1:1 disc copy is that it fails to eject, and dumps the data before i can put the other disc in. if it ejected automatically it would be saved for the next disc pop in for recording
2010-04-03T09:03:00.000Z	bazhang	robertzaccour	never tried with brasero, so cannot advise there, k9copy can do that as I have used that to backup data dvd's and the like ie 1:1 copy
2010-04-03T09:04:00.000Z	robertzaccour	bazhang	oh ok thanks
2010-04-03T12:35:00.000Z	bazhang	robertzaccour	no cursing please
2010-11-07T07:21:00.000Z	bazhang	robertzaccour	offtopic chat to #ubuntu-offtopic please
2010-11-07T07:21:00.000Z	robertzaccour	bazhang	not offtopic
2010-11-07T07:21:00.000Z	bazhang	robertzaccour	complaining about channel and such is certainly offtopic. Please take it there.
2010-11-07T07:23:00.000Z	robertzaccour	bazhang	complaining about simple questions being ignored and only "complicated" stuff being of importance for help is sad and reflects on the community as a whole. good day
2011-02-13T08:53:00.000Z	bazhang	robertzaccour	ask in the #crunchbang channel for their theme
2012-03-26T17:46:00.000Z	bazhang	robertzaccour	how is that an ubuntu support issue
2012-03-26T17:57:00.000Z	robertzaccour	bazhang	because its related to support for accessories info? figured someone would know
2012-03-26T17:58:00.000Z	bazhang	robertzaccour	try #ubuntu-offtopic for that
2012-03-26T18:02:00.000Z	bazhang	robertzaccour	thats enough
