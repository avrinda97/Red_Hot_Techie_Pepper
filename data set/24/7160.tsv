2005-04-11T07:32:00.000Z	EvilSporkMan	Dr_Aevil	can we do a wizard with directions for install? ^^;
2005-04-11T07:33:00.000Z	Dr_Aevil	EvilSporkMan	not sure yet, atm it's a bit risky, at least in the US
2005-04-11T07:33:00.000Z	EvilSporkMan	Dr_Aevil	wait, now it's risky to provide directions for installing somebody's software? sheesh.
2005-04-11T07:34:00.000Z	Dr_Aevil	EvilSporkMan	this is the debate going on atm :( sad isn't it?
2005-04-11T07:34:00.000Z	EvilSporkMan	Dr_Aevil	you're kidding
2005-04-11T07:36:00.000Z	Dr_Aevil	EvilSporkMan	nope sadly not - there are those who want mere instructions, mere "manuals" of how to obtain infringing material or that facilitate infringement to give way to liabilty for those that give them.  This is party the debate in the supreme court atm with the riaa and the p2p guys, - they provided the "means" to get at the copyrighted works, does that make them accessories to the acts of infringement committed by their users?
2005-04-11T07:37:00.000Z	EvilSporkMan	Dr_Aevil	I think you're confusing the issue. It's not infringing to install the software on a linux system, it's just that the installer provided does not obey the filing idiosyncracies of each particular distribution
2005-04-11T07:39:00.000Z	Dr_Aevil	EvilSporkMan	I'm sorry, I don't think I follow that last point you made. Isn't the whole point of the software not being available that it *is* potentially an infringement to install/use it?
2005-04-11T07:40:00.000Z	EvilSporkMan	Dr_Aevil	well, the software I have in mind is Java, the canonical example of this sort of thing. I suspect I ought to look into w32codecs so I know what I'm talking about
2005-04-11T07:42:00.000Z	Dr_Aevil	EvilSporkMan	well java is not per se such an enormous problem - it's not at all infringing to install it if you agree to their license (and to be clear the license that is not free-software compliant is the runtime environment rather than the language itself - this is why gcj is being made).  The thing about the likes of libdvdcss is that it potentially infringes (shudder) patents in the U.S.
2005-04-11T07:44:00.000Z	EvilSporkMan	Dr_Aevil	ok, just make ubuntu interoperable with the way libdvdcss installs itself (./configure && make && make install)
2005-04-11T07:44:00.000Z	EvilSporkMan	Dr_Aevil	have a nice parental message about unsupported packages
2005-04-11T07:46:00.000Z	EvilSporkMan	Dr_Aevil	ok, to resolve issue 2 it's really simple
2005-04-11T07:47:00.000Z	EvilSporkMan	Dr_Aevil	no issue 2 items in ubuntu. Provide generic "install .ubuntu package" GUI. ubuntu packages for anything people want will become available.
2005-04-11T07:48:00.000Z	Dr_Aevil	EvilSporkMan	I think resolving issue 1 is easier, because for issue 1 you can make your easy installers with nice click-through license agreements that say "agree to the divx license" etc, issue 2 is harder
2005-04-11T07:48:00.000Z	EvilSporkMan	Dr_Aevil	yeah, so do that and do what i just said for issue 2 (sorry, i don't know what packages ubuntu uses)
2005-04-11T07:49:00.000Z	Dr_Aevil	EvilSporkMan	potentially though, with issue 2, if the supreme court comes down in their favour etc it won't be legal to provide any kind of access to them
2005-04-11T07:50:00.000Z	EvilSporkMan	Dr_Aevil	at that level it's not us. Otherwise windows would have to refuse to run installers for illicit material, which it of course can't be made to do
2005-04-11T07:50:00.000Z	Dr_Aevil	EvilSporkMan	not really - there's a big difference between the windows world model and the linux notion of a distribution - windows isn't bundled with instructions telling you to go download tv series with bittorrent etc
2005-04-11T07:51:00.000Z	Dr_Aevil	EvilSporkMan	windows - the user has to go fetch - a linux distribution brings it all into the fold
2005-04-11T07:52:00.000Z	EvilSporkMan	Dr_Aevil	that's why "ubuntu, inc." is not packaging infringing software. "Some schmuck" can distribute it, and we're not going to be the copyright gestapo and scan everything
2005-04-11T07:52:00.000Z	EvilSporkMan	Dr_Aevil	a package is directly analogous to a windows installer
2005-04-11T07:52:00.000Z	Dr_Aevil	EvilSporkMan	yep totally agree with you - the issue that's debated at the moment is totally about how much information people can legally give to other people to allow them to find infringing material
2005-04-11T08:11:00.000Z	Dr_Aevil	EvilSporkMan	about 85p a litre
