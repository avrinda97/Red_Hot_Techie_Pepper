2010-07-27T14:01:00.000Z	blink	erUSUL	what can i do about that?
2010-07-27T14:02:00.000Z	erUSUL	blink	resize partitions ? but if it is a wubi install i dunno how to do it
2010-07-27T14:03:00.000Z	blink	erUSUL	what's the difference here? isn't Ubuntu fully installed now or what? I used wubi because my pc doesn't boot from usb plus i had no cds
2010-07-27T14:04:00.000Z	erUSUL	blink	it is installed in a big file in your windows disk acting as a "virtual" disk.
2010-07-27T14:05:00.000Z	blink	erUSUL	is it possible to alter that and install it fully??
2010-07-27T14:06:00.000Z	erUSUL	blink	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WubiGuide#How do I resize the virtual disks?

2010-08-10T19:03:00.000Z	blink	erUSUL	where can i find that? just run command in terminal??
2010-08-10T19:03:00.000Z	erUSUL	blink	sudo aptitude install icedtea-java7-jre
2010-08-10T19:04:00.000Z	erUSUL	blink	that's not a plugin. is the java system
2010-08-10T19:04:00.000Z	blink	erUSUL	any missing stuff I mean.
2010-08-10T19:08:00.000Z	blink	erUSUL	still the same error. do I have to restart my system?
2010-08-10T19:08:00.000Z	erUSUL	blink	maybe you downloading the wrong version of limewire ?
2010-08-10T19:10:00.000Z	blink	erUSUL	i was downloading from the non-official website. lemme see if the main one works. otherwise, i'll have to restart my system.
