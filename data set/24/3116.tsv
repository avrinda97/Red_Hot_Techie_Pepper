2008-12-15T05:11:00.000Z	RITN		that sounds like 2 hours in this room and no one could help.
2008-12-15T05:11:00.000Z	trollboy	RITN	what's your issue
2008-12-15T05:12:00.000Z	trollboy	RITN	I've seen that before.. its user parm errors
2008-12-15T05:12:00.000Z	trollboy	RITN	 try killing the uid and gid and authing against pam
2008-12-15T05:13:00.000Z	trollboy	RITN	by specifying uid and gid you're forcing the mount to a user
2008-12-15T05:14:00.000Z	trollboy	RITN	Pam is the basic "user/password" system of linux
2008-12-15T05:15:00.000Z	trollboy	RITN	you see what I'm saying
2008-12-15T05:17:00.000Z	RITN	trollboy	it logs in fine.
2008-12-15T05:17:00.000Z	trollboy	RITN	type "cat /etc/passwd" on your local box, you'll see a list of users, in the following format Username:password(replaced with x):uid
2008-12-15T05:19:00.000Z	trollboy	RITN	what sort of NAS
2008-12-15T05:19:00.000Z	trollboy	RITN	what else are you connecting to it with?
2008-12-15T05:20:00.000Z	trollboy	RITN	how do you auth to it?
2008-12-15T05:20:00.000Z	trollboy	RITN	from the windows box, how do you auth to it?
2008-12-15T05:21:00.000Z	trollboy	RITN	this is from my /etc/mtab trollboy@192.168.1.101:/storage /home/trollboy/fileserver fuse.sshfs rw,nosuid,nodev,max_read=65536,user=trollboy 0 0
2008-12-15T05:22:00.000Z	trollboy	RITN	paste me your line again, and what file is it in?
2008-12-15T05:25:00.000Z	trollboy	RITN	and your gentoo box worked as well?
2008-12-15T05:26:00.000Z	trollboy	RITN	thought you were saying you could make it work with gentoo but not ubuntu?
2008-12-15T05:27:00.000Z	RITN	trollboy	that was just out of frustration
2008-12-15T05:28:00.000Z	trollboy	RITN	ah, fair enough.  Try to avoid that as it can cause issues.  Now, from the windows boxes, you connect just fine as ritn?
2008-12-15T05:29:00.000Z	trollboy	RITN	sorta?
2008-12-15T05:29:00.000Z	trollboy	RITN	msg me
