2007-05-09T14:07:00.000Z	VSpike		oh... well that's just dandy.  Close one app and KDE kicker crashes.  Now it won't even restart, just crashes every time
2007-05-09T14:09:00.000Z	VSpike		At the moment, I swear the perception that a graphical linux desktop environment is more reliable than a vanilla Windows XP install is so not true
2007-05-09T14:09:00.000Z	haru	VSpike	i strongly differ
2007-05-09T14:10:00.000Z	haru	VSpike	most people i got to switch over here from win to nix is because of the gnome layout
2007-05-09T14:10:00.000Z	haru	VSpike	try gnome
2007-05-09T14:12:00.000Z	VSpike	haru	woudln't I just be in danger of swapping one set of problems for another one?  Also, some would presumably persist, e.g. firefox, evolution
2007-05-09T14:12:00.000Z	VSpike	haru	none of these are showstoppers, just grind you down.
2007-05-09T14:12:00.000Z	haru	VSpike	shudnt hope so.. kde crashes a lot on me while gnome stays stable
2007-05-09T14:13:00.000Z	VSpike	haru	Well, heck I'll give it a go.  I have Gnome installed anyway
2007-05-09T14:13:00.000Z	haru	VSpike	(Y)
2007-05-09T14:14:00.000Z	VSpike	haru	It's wierd.  So much stuff in Linux is just amazing, but a lot of it feels like exactly what it is .. a work in progress
2007-05-09T14:15:00.000Z	haru	VSpike	:) that i agree with
2007-05-09T14:15:00.000Z	VSpike	haru	most of these bugs, when apport picks them up, when I get to launchpad I find that they've been reported dozens of times already, so I'm not the only one :)
2007-05-09T14:18:00.000Z	VSpike	haru	nothing crashed yet ;)
2007-05-09T14:18:00.000Z	haru	VSpike	yay gnome :P
2007-05-10T05:15:00.000Z	haru	VSpike	really.. :S i am pretty confortable with gnome
2007-05-10T05:15:00.000Z	haru	VSpike	what went wrong?
2007-05-10T05:18:00.000Z	VSpike	haru	first, firefox stopped loading pages, but networking was still OK - konqueror still worked.  Then it just went downhill from there... eventually it forgot my keyboard layout, all the control panel apps would start then exit immediately, i was getting wierd drawing effects on widgets in most programs, gnome-terminal would segfault immediately (although konsole still worked), and even the logout dialog would only appear some of the time, and
2007-05-10T05:19:00.000Z	haru	VSpike	lol... thats very weird
2007-05-10T05:19:00.000Z	VSpike	haru	I logged back into KDE, and everything works OK, including the gnome-terminal and firefox :)
2007-05-10T05:20:00.000Z	VSpike	haru	I'm still getting some wierd widget things on some gnome apps.  I've turned off the KDE setting that tries to make gnome apps use KDE styles
2007-05-10T05:20:00.000Z	VSpike	haru	It seems to be helping - probably need to restart KDE to be sure
2007-05-10T05:21:00.000Z	VSpike	haru	I'd really like it to work because I was digging it, but I can't deal with all that
2007-05-10T05:21:00.000Z	VSpike	haru	gut feeling is that it's to do with styles and widgets, and KDE conflicting with GTK somehow
