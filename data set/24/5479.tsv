2006-06-29T05:24:00.000Z	Warbo	Dapallo	Package versions are not necissarly program versions. Updates may contain the same version, but packaged a little better
2006-06-29T05:28:00.000Z	Warbo	Dapallo	"killall esd"
2006-06-29T05:41:00.000Z	Warbo	Dapallo	You tried running "killall esd" before loading Audacity?
2006-06-29T05:42:00.000Z	Dapallo	Warbo	i did.  that got rid of the error, but, It still wont record
2006-06-29T05:42:00.000Z	Warbo	Dapallo	Sorry, my microphone is crappy so I have never bothered trying
2006-06-29T06:24:00.000Z	Warbo	Dapallo	rm -r
2006-06-29T06:25:00.000Z	Warbo	Dapallo	rmdir will remove an empty directory, rm -r will go through the directory removing everything in it, then the directory itself
2006-06-29T07:57:00.000Z	Warbo	Dapallo	just double click it (you will find it in ~/.wine)
2006-06-29T08:05:00.000Z	Warbo	Dapallo	~/.wine/drive_c/Program Files
2006-06-29T08:41:00.000Z	Warbo	Dapallo	Wire = Different IP address? Wireless = Different network name/key?
2006-06-29T08:42:00.000Z	Warbo	Dapallo	I am guessing that the machine you are connecting to is Windows?
2006-06-29T08:43:00.000Z	Warbo	Dapallo	If it is a Linux machine then make sure you set up your gateway as the Internet connected machine, and set up IP Masquerading on that machine (Firestarter can do this for you)
2006-06-29T08:43:00.000Z	Dapallo	Warbo	im not trying to connect to another machine.  Just the router
2006-06-29T08:44:00.000Z	Warbo	Dapallo	OK, if it uses DHCP then it should be pretty simple
