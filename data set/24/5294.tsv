2006-08-24T13:01:00.000Z	macogw		typing that in doesnt make it go
2006-08-24T13:02:00.000Z	ubuntu	macogw	 i think gnome-network-preferences
2006-08-24T13:05:00.000Z	ubuntu	macogw	 try network-admin
2008-02-28T00:43:00.000Z	macogw	ubuntu	SMART checks the hardware
2008-02-28T00:44:00.000Z	ubuntu	macogw	is that an option to the badblocks program?
2008-02-28T00:44:00.000Z	macogw	ubuntu	no, SMART is part of your hard drive's firmware
2008-02-28T00:45:00.000Z	macogw	ubuntu	install smartmontools, then run "sudo smartctl -a /dev/sda" and itll tell you what hardware errors your hard drive is reporting
2008-02-28T00:45:00.000Z	ubuntu	macogw	- oh, how do I use it?
2008-02-28T00:45:00.000Z	ubuntu	macogw	--ok
2008-02-28T00:45:00.000Z	ubuntu	macogw	and this works for any hard drive?
2008-02-28T00:45:00.000Z	macogw	ubuntu	use -t to schedule a test.  it can take a few hours
2008-02-28T00:45:00.000Z	macogw	ubuntu	not on externals
2008-02-28T00:45:00.000Z	macogw	ubuntu	external usb enclosures dont pass the information
2008-02-28T00:46:00.000Z	macogw	ubuntu	wont work on drives from the 20th century either
2008-02-28T00:49:00.000Z	macogw	ubuntu	its actually more like any drive in teh last 4 years definitely has smart, before that maybe/maybe not
2008-02-28T00:49:00.000Z	macogw	ubuntu	youre not trying to do it over usb are you?
2008-02-28T00:49:00.000Z	ubuntu	macogw	- no
2008-02-28T00:49:00.000Z	macogw	ubuntu	ok then guess you cant get hw infos
2008-02-28T00:50:00.000Z	ubuntu	macogw	-- thanks anyway. The WIndows OS on the hard drive is not booting.  I wanted to confirm whether this was a windows problem or a  hard drive problem. Is there any other way?
2008-04-10T07:23:00.000Z	macogw	ubuntu	same thing in uubntu
2008-04-10T07:23:00.000Z	macogw	ubuntu	other distros would use gksu to be like su and gksudo to be like sudo, but since ubuntu just uses sudo for eerything, they function the same except gksu involves less typing
2008-04-10T07:24:00.000Z	macogw	ubuntu	gksudo pops up a box to ask and does extra permissions checks to keep from breaking GUI apps
2008-04-10T07:24:00.000Z	ubuntu	macogw	i don't like gksu. i say it out loud, in my head, and it sounds like an angry japanese guy
