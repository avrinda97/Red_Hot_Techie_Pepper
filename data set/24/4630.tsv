2009-12-02T21:25:00.000Z	coz_	RenatoSilva	 if on gnome   gtk-window-decorator
2009-12-02T21:28:00.000Z	coz_	RenatoSilva	  you can  do   from alt+F2   gtk-window-decorator --replace
2009-12-02T21:28:00.000Z	RenatoSilva	coz_	sorry, do what?
2009-12-02T21:29:00.000Z	RenatoSilva	coz_	enable it, ok
2009-12-02T21:29:00.000Z	coz_	RenatoSilva	 on your keyboard  press alt+F2
2009-12-02T21:29:00.000Z	RenatoSilva	coz_	I don't want to activate it
2009-12-02T21:29:00.000Z	coz_	RenatoSilva	 oh
2009-12-02T21:29:00.000Z	coz_	RenatoSilva	 ok well..emerald is no longer developed or maintained
2009-12-02T21:29:00.000Z	RenatoSilva	coz_	^^
2009-12-02T21:29:00.000Z	RenatoSilva	coz_	^
2009-12-02T21:29:00.000Z	coz_	RenatoSilva	  so you have the choice on gnome   of gtk-window-decorator or on  kde   kde4-window-decorator
2009-12-02T21:32:00.000Z	coz_	RenatoSilva	 there are no replacements at this time... we talked about creating a new decorator but it was discussed only once and nothing has been done yet
2009-12-02T21:32:00.000Z	coz_	RenatoSilva	 so the ONLY replacements are  gtk-window-decorator or kde4-window-decorator
2009-12-02T21:33:00.000Z	RenatoSilva	coz_	so if I want to keep my Vista look, I must keep using Emerald. Ah.
2009-12-02T21:33:00.000Z	coz_	RenatoSilva	 for the time being   yes.... until the developers decide on how or what kind of new decorator will be created
2009-12-02T21:34:00.000Z	RenatoSilva	coz_	do I have emerald here just because of upgrating continuously, or is it in Karmic repo yet?
2009-12-02T21:34:00.000Z	coz_	RenatoSilva	it is still in karmic
2009-12-02T21:52:00.000Z	coz_	RenatoSilva	 ok guy
2010-08-12T08:01:00.000Z	coz_	RenatoSilva	 oooo  tough question for me to answer... I am still getting used to grub2 :)  but there are a ton of how to's online and you can go to the #grub channel
2010-08-12T08:01:00.000Z	RenatoSilva	coz_	google is a bad guy
2010-08-12T08:01:00.000Z	RenatoSilva	coz_	I guess that's impossible. Would not be surprised.
2010-08-12T08:02:00.000Z	RenatoSilva	coz_	I just upgraded to grub2 but I liked the old font, I think it was just bolder
2010-08-12T08:05:00.000Z	coz_	RenatoSilva	 sorry if I havent been much help
