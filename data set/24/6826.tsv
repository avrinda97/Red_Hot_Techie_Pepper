2005-07-05T13:42:00.000Z	jtan325		you know what i hate the most about ubuntu
2005-07-05T13:42:00.000Z	jtan325		is that you have to freakin guess which packages are needed to install crap
2005-07-05T13:42:00.000Z	jtan325		i just spent the past 4 hours figuring out why i couldn't build numarray by source
2005-07-05T13:42:00.000Z	jtan325		well
2005-07-05T13:43:00.000Z	jtan325		not if you want to upgrade numarray to 1.3.2
2005-07-05T13:43:00.000Z	jtan325		that's in breezy
2005-07-05T13:43:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	jtan325	search google and figure out what stuff does
2005-07-05T13:43:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	jtan325	besides, there are extended descriptions of things in synaptic
2005-07-08T16:23:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	jtan325	I think it's fsck
2005-07-08T13:36:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	jtan325	complains about what?
2005-07-08T13:37:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	jtan325	that means there's no folder called "/mnt/WINLIN1"
2005-07-08T13:37:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	jtan325	just make an empty directory
2005-07-08T13:37:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	jtan325	you have to mount it to an empty directory that exists
2005-07-08T13:39:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	jtan325	"sudo nautilus"
2005-07-15T10:15:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	jtan325	instead of?
2005-07-15T10:16:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	jtan325	ubuntu does use .xsession
2005-07-15T10:16:00.000Z	jtan325	tiglionabbit	do i have to do anything special
2005-07-15T10:18:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	jtan325	well, there's system -> preferences -> sessions, Startup Items tab
2005-07-15T10:18:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	jtan325	yep
2005-07-15T10:19:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	jtan325	I don't know
2005-07-15T10:21:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	jtan325	you're right, I'm pretty sure it doesn't
2005-07-15T11:07:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	jtan325	we don't.  Try asking on ubuntuforums
2005-07-15T13:00:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	jtan325	I do
2005-07-15T13:00:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	jtan325	I bet Razor-X knows a ton though
