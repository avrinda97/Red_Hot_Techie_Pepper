2006-08-15T11:02:00.000Z	richiefrich	willys_fueguino	thats qute dumb.. imo
2006-08-15T11:02:00.000Z	willys_fueguino	richiefrich	what thing??
2006-08-15T11:03:00.000Z	willys_fueguino	richiefrich	in the alternate cd when you install in the oem mode thats the user wich installs the ubuntu..
2006-08-15T11:04:00.000Z	willys_fueguino	richiefrich	and when you first boot lets you make the users but if xserver fails you can't make the users
2006-08-15T11:04:00.000Z	richiefrich	willys_fueguino	so u must then go del him and then make a new one once u boot.. that seems so logical to me ..  *sarcasm*
2006-08-15T11:06:00.000Z	willys_fueguino	richiefrich	it's oem@ubuntu $ sudo oem-config-prepare then reboot and automaticly erases that user and lets you create your user but thats only if the xserver works fine
2006-08-15T11:11:00.000Z	willys_fueguino	richiefrich	You used the alternate cd even once??
2006-08-15T11:12:00.000Z	richiefrich	willys_fueguino	no i just find ikt odd
2006-08-15T11:14:00.000Z	willys_fueguino	richiefrich	I had to use cause I'm a newbie and I coudn't fix xorg... with it that cd I learnt a lot...
2006-08-15T11:16:00.000Z	richiefrich	willys_fueguino	no i been using since 93.. but i run arch and gentoo and that oem seems really odd to me thats all
2006-08-15T11:17:00.000Z	willys_fueguino	richiefrich	oks.... ;-)
