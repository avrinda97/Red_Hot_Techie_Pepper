2008-12-01T23:40:00.000Z	heogen		I tray to install
2008-12-01T23:40:00.000Z	heogen		 sudo apt-get install /home/heogen/programa/s3savage-1.0-15/install.sh
2008-12-01T23:40:00.000Z	heogen		E: Couldn't find package
2008-12-01T23:41:00.000Z	heogen		this is the wrong
2008-12-01T23:41:00.000Z	heogen		E: Couldn't find package
2008-12-01T23:41:00.000Z	pmjdebruijn	heogen	.sh isn't a package
2008-12-01T23:47:00.000Z	pmjdebruijn	heogen	seriously, I've been warned! proceed at your own risk...
2008-12-01T23:41:00.000Z	pmjdebruijn	heogen	and why would you want to install that?
2008-12-01T23:41:00.000Z	pmjdebruijn	heogen	to do what?
2008-12-01T23:41:00.000Z	pmjdebruijn	heogen	doesn't it already work?
2008-12-01T23:41:00.000Z	pmjdebruijn	heogen	Doesn't your graphics card already work?
2008-12-01T23:42:00.000Z	pmjdebruijn	heogen	then why install anything?
2008-12-01T23:42:00.000Z	pmjdebruijn	heogen	are you sure what you're about to install supports that?
2008-12-01T23:43:00.000Z	pmjdebruijn	heogen	external drivers are usually rubbish, and the best way to screw up your Ubuntu install, so I'd strongly recommend against install such things
2008-12-01T23:44:00.000Z	pmjdebruijn	heogen	I don't know... ProSavage is old hardware
2008-12-01T23:44:00.000Z	pmjdebruijn	heogen	in the past Via/S3 never have been very cooperative
2008-12-01T23:45:00.000Z	pmjdebruijn	heogen	it's very possible you can't without a very high risk of cripling your Ubuntu install
2008-12-01T23:46:00.000Z	pmjdebruijn	heogen	I know... there's probably no easy solution...
2008-12-01T23:46:00.000Z	pmjdebruijn	heogen	some hardware just doesn't work 100%, especially with uncooperative vendors
2008-12-01T23:48:00.000Z	pmjdebruijn	heogen	again! S3 makes crappy software... proceed at own risk...
2008-12-01T23:48:00.000Z	pmjdebruijn	heogen	if your system breaks, it won't be
2008-12-01T23:49:00.000Z	pmjdebruijn	heogen	good luck with that then, I won't help you destroy your system...
2008-12-01T23:49:00.000Z	pmjdebruijn	heogen	installing that S3 crap, will possibly cripple your system... again good luck... I won't help you
2008-12-01T23:50:00.000Z	pmjdebruijn	heogen	you seriously don't know what you're getting yourself into
