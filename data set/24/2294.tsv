2009-02-10T12:28:00.000Z	MeVsTheVoices	G-Blunted	Where the hell you getting that from?
2009-02-10T12:30:00.000Z	MeVsTheVoices	G-Blunted	Open a floppy disc up and tell me what you see
2009-02-10T12:30:00.000Z	G-Blunted	MeVsTheVoices	 oh shit..that's a very good call
2009-02-10T12:59:00.000Z	MeVsTheVoices	G-Blunted	Don't
2009-02-10T12:59:00.000Z	MeVsTheVoices	G-Blunted	If its shutting off, theres a reason
2009-02-10T13:01:00.000Z	G-Blunted	MeVsTheVoices	you know how don't you....
2009-02-10T13:02:00.000Z	MeVsTheVoices	G-Blunted	Yes, if theres a problem that wasn't there before, check if your sensor got buggled around, the most common cause of random shutdown is CPU overheat because of the sensor being too close
2009-02-10T13:03:00.000Z	G-Blunted	MeVsTheVoices	 that makes sense
2009-02-10T13:03:00.000Z	MeVsTheVoices	G-Blunted	You can change the shutdown temp on most, thats secret do'
2009-02-10T13:03:00.000Z	G-Blunted	MeVsTheVoices	that's secret what?
2009-02-10T13:03:00.000Z	MeVsTheVoices	G-Blunted	Though
2009-02-10T13:04:00.000Z	G-Blunted	MeVsTheVoices	i looked in cmos and it wasn't there...you think i need a special app that taps in to the hardware more or something? can you give me a hint? :)
