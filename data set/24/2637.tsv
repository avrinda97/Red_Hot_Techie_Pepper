2008-10-14T01:02:00.000Z	disco		Does anyone already had a problem with NetworkManager and dhclient interaction ? It looks like NetworkManager launches dhclient which get an IP address successfully, but then NetworkManager is never notified about this IP address.
2008-10-14T01:02:00.000Z	disco		So NetworkManager pretend I'm not connected. That is, I need to do it manually
2008-10-14T01:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	disco	i always just edit /etc/network/interfaces but mi old school
2008-10-14T01:04:00.000Z	disco	ActionParsnip	me too. but if i deactivate the NetworkManager there is some sie effects, like Firefox beeing automatically in "offline" mode
2008-10-14T01:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	disco	you can patch ff to not do that

2008-10-14T01:05:00.000Z	disco	ActionParsnip	additionnaly on my laptop i'm using several locations and it's interesting to have it automatically connected according to the location you are in
2008-10-14T01:05:00.000Z	disco	ActionParsnip	thanks for tip.
2008-10-14T01:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	disco	network manager is pointless if you can use the config file
2008-10-14T01:07:00.000Z	disco	ActionParsnip	afaik, in the config file, you can have only *one* configuration, for one location
2008-10-14T01:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	disco	you can have multiple files ready to be cp'd in thought ;)
2008-10-14T01:08:00.000Z	disco	ActionParsnip	then you need to run a script for each location/configuration.
2008-10-14T01:08:00.000Z	disco	ActionParsnip	yep, sure. But if it could be run automatically, it's not that bad
2008-10-14T01:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	disco	i think thats fine unless you change location on an hurly basis
2008-10-14T01:09:00.000Z	disco	ActionParsnip	and, anyway, it's working at 90% with NetworkManager :)
2008-10-14T01:10:00.000Z	disco	ActionParsnip	so, I thought about correcting the bug before writting scripts
2008-10-14T01:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	disco	its a way to work until you get a success, i personally only use 1 wireless lan so have no issues
2008-10-14T01:12:00.000Z	disco	ActionParsnip	I'm using wireless at home, wired at a first work place and wireless/vpnc at a second work place.
2008-10-14T01:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	disco	id just have 3 and 3 bash scripts to copy the relevant file to interfaces
2008-10-14T01:13:00.000Z	disco	ActionParsnip	with different proxy configuration. I already made scripts. But I wanted to use the gnome tools ;)
2008-10-14T01:15:00.000Z	disco	ActionParsnip	What's weird is that it almost work. networkmanager is just not notified by dhclient that an IP has been caught...
2008-10-14T01:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	disco	log a bug
2008-10-14T01:16:00.000Z	disco	ActionParsnip	will do that
2008-10-14T01:16:00.000Z	disco	ActionParsnip	thanks for tips anyway.
