2005-09-05T10:26:00.000Z	glyn		I just reinstalled Ubuntu Hoary..how do I get my bittorrent to work?
2005-09-05T10:27:00.000Z	glyn		can anyone help me with getting Gnome bittorrent to work?
2005-09-05T10:28:00.000Z	glyn		whenever I try to download the torrent file it says timeout exceeded
2005-09-05T10:29:00.000Z	nalioth	glyn	easy. dont use it
2005-09-05T10:29:00.000Z	nalioth	glyn	install bittorrent instead
2005-09-05T10:29:00.000Z	nalioth	glyn	System > Admin > synaptic (it's a wonderful program. you'll like it)
2005-09-05T11:22:00.000Z	nalioth	glyn	a .sh file is a "shell script" . it is executed by the shell (synonymous with a windows batch file)
2005-09-05T12:13:00.000Z	nalioth	glyn	writing to ntfs from linux is a good first step to an all linux system
2005-09-05T12:16:00.000Z	nalioth	glyn	you run windows
2005-09-05T12:16:00.000Z	nalioth	glyn	you can read from the ntfs partition all you like
2005-09-05T12:24:00.000Z	nalioth	glyn	it is in your /media directory
2005-09-05T12:31:00.000Z	nalioth	glyn	you really should read the link ubotu sent you
2005-09-05T12:36:00.000Z	nalioth	glyn	you really should get some terminal basics under your belt (cuz you could wreck something <like your NTFS partition>)
2005-09-14T14:34:00.000Z	nalioth	glyn	yes, but no data will be left over
2005-09-14T14:41:00.000Z	nalioth	glyn	you realize you could destroy your NTFS partition that way, right?
2005-09-14T14:42:00.000Z	nalioth	glyn	then why not convert the partition to ext3?
2005-09-14T14:42:00.000Z	nalioth	glyn	ah Dr. Frankenstein
2005-09-20T09:20:00.000Z	nalioth	glyn	we dont recommend it
2005-09-20T09:20:00.000Z	nalioth	glyn	writing to NTFS (even with captive) can kill the rest off
2005-09-21T12:40:00.000Z	nalioth	glyn	of course it does
2005-10-13T16:44:00.000Z	nalioth	glyn	check you memory with memtest
2005-10-13T16:46:00.000Z	nalioth	glyn	one of your boot options should be memtest, or d/l the iso from ubcd.sourceforge.net
2005-12-01T13:56:00.000Z	nalioth	glyn	tars?>
2005-12-01T14:01:00.000Z	nalioth	glyn	follow the links
