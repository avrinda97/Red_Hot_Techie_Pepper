2009-09-14T01:30:00.000Z	willca	Scombr0	| wicd works better with wap/2
2009-09-14T01:31:00.000Z	Scombr0	willca	already tried and it won't connect :/
2009-09-14T01:32:00.000Z	willca	Scombr0	| sometimes you have to edit the settings in wicd-client -n and point it 2 the right interface
2009-09-14T01:33:00.000Z	willca	Scombr0	| you also need to comment out all your hardware interface in /etc/network/interfaces for wicd to work properly
2009-09-14T01:34:00.000Z	willca	Scombr0	| wicd-client -n and look for options on the menu bar
2009-09-14T01:35:00.000Z	Scombr0	willca	 all I have in my /etc/network/interfeaces is: "auto lo" and "iface lo inet loopback" (with no ").
2009-09-14T01:35:00.000Z	willca	Scombr0	| if you really like to edit wpa manually. www.ubuntuguide.org and look for Feisty
2009-09-14T01:37:00.000Z	Scombr0	willca	first i'm gonna do what you told me, comment those lines and then the wicd-client -n
2009-09-14T01:38:00.000Z	willca	Scombr0	| don't forget to reload /etc/init.d/networking restart .... after commenting
2009-09-14T01:46:00.000Z	willca	Scombr0	| does this give you any output ... sudo iwconfig and sudo iwlist <wifi nic> scan
2009-09-14T01:49:00.000Z	Scombr0	willca	what do I put in <wifi nic>?
2009-09-14T01:49:00.000Z	Scombr0	willca	btw, sudo iwconfig response: http://www.nomorepasting.com/getpaste.php?pasteid=28919
2009-09-14T01:49:00.000Z	willca	Scombr0	| what interface shows up with wifi related output when u sudo iwconfig
2009-09-14T01:52:00.000Z	Scombr0	willca	here is the sudo iwlist wlan0 scan: http://www.nomorepasting.com/getpaste.php?pasteid=28921
2009-09-14T01:54:00.000Z	Scombr0	willca	as I can see, i want to connect to Cell 01.
2009-09-14T01:56:00.000Z	willca	Scombr0	| just go to www.ubuntuguide.org and try their steps if none of my suggestion works
