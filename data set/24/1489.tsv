2010-01-11T21:21:00.000Z	blackxored		with which audio player I can auto-fetch lyrics as I play in a gnome environment???
2010-01-11T21:21:00.000Z	Norse_Nemo	blackxored	Songbird
2010-01-11T21:21:00.000Z	blackxored	Norse_Nemo	is on the repos???
2010-01-11T21:22:00.000Z	Norse_Nemo	blackxored	no but it is super easy to install
2010-01-11T21:22:00.000Z	blackxored	Norse_Nemo	where I can get songbird?
2010-01-11T21:22:00.000Z	Norse_Nemo	blackxored	Google search Songbird
2010-01-11T21:23:00.000Z	Norse_Nemo	blackxored	freeware
2010-01-11T21:23:00.000Z	Norse_Nemo	blackxored	it is made by Mozilla
2010-01-11T21:23:00.000Z	blackxored	Norse_Nemo	"freeware" isn't a license, I was wondering because there *might* be a reason to not being included in the repos
2010-01-11T21:24:00.000Z	blackxored	Norse_Nemo	if I were going to judge because of the UI, you got 10 pts
2010-01-11T21:24:00.000Z	Norse_Nemo	blackxored	give Songbird a try, you will love it I promise
2010-01-11T21:25:00.000Z	blackxored	Norse_Nemo	what I meant by being in the repos, is that we normally *adapt* applications
2010-01-11T21:26:00.000Z	Norse_Nemo	blackxored	i understand what you mean, it is fairly new and not in the repos yet, it would not surprise me to find it there soon though
2010-01-11T21:26:00.000Z	blackxored	Norse_Nemo	although if they do their tests on a ubuntu system, they might taken care of that by themselves
2010-01-11T21:26:00.000Z	Norse_Nemo	blackxored	let me know what you think
2010-01-11T21:26:00.000Z	blackxored	Norse_Nemo	I though it was the license
2010-01-11T21:27:00.000Z	Norse_Nemo	blackxored	it has the same license as all mozila software
2010-01-11T21:27:00.000Z	blackxored	Norse_Nemo	so why's not in the repos???
2010-01-11T21:28:00.000Z	blackxored	Norse_Nemo	I'd take care of it when time arises if no one has done that before
2010-01-11T21:28:00.000Z	blackxored	Norse_Nemo	of course, I'll try it first
2010-01-11T21:28:00.000Z	Norse_Nemo	blackxored	giht on
2010-01-11T21:42:00.000Z	Norse_Nemo	blackxored	just found out it is not in the repos because it is a developers release
2010-01-11T21:42:00.000Z	blackxored	Norse_Nemo	hehehe, also there's not because it forkes xulrunner heavily, and won't build with normal xulrunner, so in the meantime, I'll skip to the tarball
2010-01-11T21:43:00.000Z	Norse_Nemo	blackxored	right on, have you installed yet?
