2005-09-14T12:45:00.000Z	whitehorse1		[Help needed] . {K}ubuntu. I have a critical problem w/installer, preventing install. The problem is with underlying debian installer - it will not partition, just returns invalid function message and loops within back/continue screen. Help, pretty please? :-(
2005-09-14T12:46:00.000Z	whitehorse1		Sorry, that was with Breezy.
2005-09-14T12:47:00.000Z	whitehorse1		Q) Is anyone in a position to help, or at least direct me to where to bring up a problem so it can be fixed, please? Kubuntu breezy, problem is with the debian installer it uses; will not partition, returning e: invalid function message and looping. : - (
2005-09-14T12:48:00.000Z	trigg	whitehorse1	sorry, might be a faulty install CD
2005-09-14T12:48:00.000Z	whitehorse1	trigg	No, it's not :) 'cause,
2005-09-14T12:49:00.000Z	whitehorse1	trigg	same issue occurs with Debian Etch (unstable) buyt not debian Sarge (stable) installers. the unstable one uses a newer installer and clearly Breezy uses that exact same installer
2005-09-14T12:49:00.000Z	trigg	whitehorse1	 hmm, you could always install ubuntu, then just install kde. . .
2005-09-14T12:50:00.000Z	whitehorse1	trigg	| CookedGryphon: It's a fresh install, the problem is with the latest version of the installer program itself
2005-09-14T12:51:00.000Z	trigg	whitehorse1	right, I would recommend using the ubuntu install cd and just switching over to kubuntu once you have a working system
2005-09-14T13:00:00.000Z	trigg	whitehorse1	install using hoary installer (5.04) change repositories and dist-upgrade - should work just fine.
2005-09-14T12:53:00.000Z	whitehorse1	trigg	I *really* want to use the latest version ie breezy, - because of it using latest x.org and kde versions (by virtue of support for my ATI card). are you 1000% sure if I install the stable ubuntu i can upgrade to breezy kubuntu by installing the kubuntu repositories contents without needing to use the non-functional installer?
2005-09-14T12:54:00.000Z	trigg	whitehorse1	shouldn't be a problem - they are effectively the same base distribution - as long as you have the kubuntu repositories
2005-09-14T12:55:00.000Z	trigg	whitehorse1	watch out for breezy right now and ATI - DRI isn't working yet.
2005-09-14T12:55:00.000Z	whitehorse1	trigg	aren't x.org and xfree stuff part of the base repository, thus necessitating using installer? ..which doesnt work as we know :)
2005-09-14T12:56:00.000Z	trigg	whitehorse1	I'm using breezy Ubuntu right now - and the installer worked for my laptop. I don't see why it wouldn't work. . .
2005-09-14T13:01:00.000Z	trigg	whitehorse1	just don't install anything from marillat before you do dist-upgrade
2005-09-14T13:03:00.000Z	trigg	whitehorse1	definitely post a bug on bugzilla - not hard to do - just check out https://bugzilla.ubuntu.com/
2005-09-14T13:04:00.000Z	trigg	whitehorse1	you will have to create an account, but it isn't that hard.
2005-09-14T13:06:00.000Z	trigg	whitehorse1	I know it's a little archaic, but maybe just writing it down and then typing it out once you log onto bugzilla with a detailed explanation of what you did (always include system specs)
2005-09-14T13:07:00.000Z	whitehorse1	trigg	'e: invalid function' is sum total of error ;) i will submit it with pc specs tho. ty very much. Where is it best to report please? a) debian bugzilla or b) ubuntu bugzilla. what i **do** know is that it's the debian installer as exact same issue occurs with debian etch distro or kubuntu breezy install (i'd preferr to use latter, ultimately_
2005-09-14T13:08:00.000Z	trigg	whitehorse1	I would put it in the kubuntu section, since that is the specifice installer that you are trying.
2005-09-14T13:09:00.000Z	trigg	whitehorse1	though you might mention that you had the same problem with etch
2005-09-14T13:09:00.000Z	whitehorse1	trigg	thank you very much
2005-09-14T13:09:00.000Z	trigg	whitehorse1	no problem
