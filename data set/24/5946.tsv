2006-04-21T14:49:00.000Z	runedude3	jadaz87	on the wpasupplicant supported list it has ndiswrapper.
2006-04-21T14:49:00.000Z	jadaz87	runedude3	no you have to see if your wireless card is supported
2006-04-21T14:50:00.000Z	jadaz87	runedude3	ndiswrapper just allows you to use windows drivers
2006-04-21T14:50:00.000Z	jadaz87	runedude3	no on this site
