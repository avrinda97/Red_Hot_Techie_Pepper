2011-01-03T01:18:00.000Z	gobbe	wolfric_	yes
2011-01-03T01:20:00.000Z	gobbe	wolfric_	so are you running 10.04?
2011-01-03T01:21:00.000Z	gobbe	wolfric_	sorry, 10.109
2011-01-03T01:22:00.000Z	gobbe	wolfric_	try sudo apt-get update, it's in main repository and is installable
2011-01-03T01:22:00.000Z	gobbe	wolfric_	i just installed it from there
2011-01-03T01:24:00.000Z	gobbe	wolfric_	your sources.list is missing main repository
2011-01-03T01:24:00.000Z	gobbe	wolfric_	you have it only with maverick-backports but not with maverick
2011-01-03T01:25:00.000Z	wolfric_	gobbe	what is the main repository line?
2011-01-03T01:26:00.000Z	gobbe	wolfric_	deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ maverick main restricted
2011-01-03T01:26:00.000Z	gobbe	wolfric_	or add ie in front of archive if you want local
2011-01-03T01:26:00.000Z	wolfric_	gobbe	am i mistaken? or are all the names after the link the repository lists you want to install... i have main there
2011-01-03T01:27:00.000Z	gobbe	wolfric_	you have main in maverick-backports
2011-01-03T01:27:00.000Z	gobbe	wolfric_	not in maverick
2011-01-03T01:27:00.000Z	gobbe	wolfric_	which line?
2011-01-03T01:27:00.000Z	wolfric_	gobbe	ah i see
2011-01-03T01:28:00.000Z	gobbe	wolfric_	so you need to have it also for plain maverick
2011-01-03T01:29:00.000Z	wolfric_	gobbe	what about the bottom line?
2011-01-03T01:30:00.000Z	gobbe	wolfric_	you could add it there
2011-01-03T01:30:00.000Z	gobbe	wolfric_	its for maverick but has only universe
2011-01-03T01:30:00.000Z	wolfric_	gobbe	cheers that worked
