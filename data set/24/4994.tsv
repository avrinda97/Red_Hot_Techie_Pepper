2009-02-05T05:52:00.000Z	Slart	fearful	what is your problem?
2009-02-05T05:54:00.000Z	Slart	fearful	where is this setting?
2009-02-05T05:54:00.000Z	Slart	fearful	somewhere in audacious?
2009-02-05T05:55:00.000Z	Slart	fearful	ahhh.. yes, devilspie might be the right thing
2009-02-05T05:55:00.000Z	Slart	fearful	there is probably some kind of switch you can use in the command that starts audacious too.. I'll look around
2009-02-05T05:57:00.000Z	Slart	fearful	are you using compiz? if so there might be a setting in there too
2009-02-05T05:59:00.000Z	Slart	fearful	you can use the "windows rules" plugin in compiz to do it
2009-02-05T05:59:00.000Z	Slart	fearful	system, preferences, appearance.. last tab.. set it to the middle one
2009-02-05T06:00:00.000Z	Slart	fearful	then install the compizconfig-settings manager..
2009-02-05T06:07:00.000Z	Slart	fearful	you're welcome
2009-02-05T06:01:00.000Z	Slart	fearful	when that is done you'll get a new menu-item in system, preferences called Compizconfig settings manager
2009-02-05T06:04:00.000Z	Slart	fearful	near the bottom there is a plugin called window rules
2009-02-05T06:05:00.000Z	Slart	fearful	you want to add audacious to the "sticky" line
2009-02-05T06:05:00.000Z	Slart	fearful	so click on the plus.. then click the grab-button and click on the audacious window and "+Add"
2009-02-05T06:06:00.000Z	Slart	fearful	well.. you can select it by title too.. might be easier
2009-02-05T06:07:00.000Z	Slart	fearful	don't forget to enable the plugin when you're done configuring it
