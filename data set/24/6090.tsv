2006-01-20T07:53:00.000Z	Nihil_Influenzat		hi! i have a problem with an HarDsik because i surely did something wrong! i changed size of the partitions, i formatted and formatted again, changed FS many times... and now that partition is gone. How can i rescue data from that partition?
2006-01-20T07:53:00.000Z	Nihil_Influenzat		when i boot the pc, system tell me that there are some errors that i have to heal manually, mayb to run fsdisk
2006-01-20T07:55:00.000Z	nbound	Nihil_Influenzat	what error exactly?
2006-01-20T07:56:00.000Z	Nihil_Influenzat	nbound	the error is: you have some errors in your HD. I'm not joking
2006-01-20T07:56:00.000Z	nbound	Nihil_Influenzat	id imagine u'll have to reformat, so a clean install would be in order
2006-01-20T07:58:00.000Z	nbound	Nihil_Influenzat	you dont need windows, if the partition which ha problems is ur one where ubuntu is installed then reinstall it, if not use gparted to re partition that area
2006-01-20T07:58:00.000Z	Nihil_Influenzat	nbound	i wish to know what stuff is inside the lost partitiion
2006-01-20T07:59:00.000Z	nbound	Nihil_Influenzat	can you access it at all?
2006-01-20T08:00:00.000Z	nbound	Nihil_Influenzat	so which one is bad... your swap partition?
2006-01-20T08:00:00.000Z	nbound	Nihil_Influenzat	try as super user
2006-01-20T08:01:00.000Z	nbound	Nihil_Influenzat	if u only run linux, why have a FAT32 partition?
2006-01-20T08:04:00.000Z	Nihil_Influenzat	nbound	i have a fat32 partition because the last year there was installed windows, now i i removed it
2006-01-20T08:05:00.000Z	nbound	Nihil_Influenzat	well if there is nothing of use on it... then its save to repartition
2006-01-20T08:06:00.000Z	Nihil_Influenzat	nbound	nihil@Portatile:~$ cd /media/usbdisk/lost+found/
2006-01-20T08:06:00.000Z	nbound	Nihil_Influenzat	add sudo to the beginning of ur commands
2006-01-20T08:07:00.000Z	Nihil_Influenzat	nbound	nihil@Portatile:~$ sudo cd /media/usbdisk/lost+found/
2006-01-20T08:08:00.000Z	nbound	Nihil_Influenzat	are you the only user of this machine?
2006-01-20T08:09:00.000Z	nbound	Nihil_Influenzat	chmod <add extra commands here>
2006-01-20T08:09:00.000Z	nbound	Nihil_Influenzat	try "chmod --help" for help on it
2006-01-20T08:10:00.000Z	Nihil_Influenzat	nbound	done
2006-01-20T08:10:00.000Z	Nihil_Influenzat	nbound	done... but there's nothing inside that folder!!!!!
2006-01-20T08:10:00.000Z	nbound	Nihil_Influenzat	was it empty before?
2006-01-20T08:10:00.000Z	Nihil_Influenzat	nbound	the system told me that inside the volume there were 900mb of stuff.... what's the matter?
2006-01-20T08:11:00.000Z	nbound	Nihil_Influenzat	no idea, this is probly why its not working ;)
