2005-01-02T12:10:00.000Z	Blackwell		that may sound familiar...:] 
2005-01-02T12:10:00.000Z	Blackwell		collecting distros is fun.
2005-01-02T12:10:00.000Z	Blackwell		computers are boring when they simply work.
2005-01-02T12:11:00.000Z	Blackwell		that way you will escape boredom successfully.
2005-01-02T12:11:00.000Z	Blackwell		runs linux fine inside vmware, too.
2005-01-02T12:12:00.000Z	|QuaD-	Blackwell	i want vmware, to cheap to pay for a license though
2005-01-02T12:12:00.000Z	Blackwell	|QuaD-	i have come to love it at the job. "oops, wrong step - roll back to snapshot state"
2005-01-02T12:13:00.000Z	|QuaD-	Blackwell	lol
2005-01-02T12:13:00.000Z	|QuaD-	Blackwell	i need a job that will pay for vmware
2005-01-02T12:13:00.000Z	Blackwell	|QuaD-	since i don't need to live with linux, vmware is excellent to make use of linux anyway, without the more heavy task of "properly" installing it and getting just everything possible to work with it.
2005-01-02T12:14:00.000Z	|QuaD-	Blackwell	i just want to run the occasional windows program to test it out
2005-01-02T12:15:00.000Z	Blackwell	|QuaD-	i tried to install vmware on mandrake once...too much fumbling. the windows install on the other hand was a matter of minutes and didn't even require a reboot.
2005-01-02T12:16:00.000Z	Blackwell	|QuaD-	i wanted vmware on that esp. for that purpose, too. ;)
2005-01-02T12:16:00.000Z	|QuaD-	Blackwell	so are you running windows on linux or linux on windows?
2005-01-02T12:17:00.000Z	Blackwell	|QuaD-	i recently installed linux inside a vmware box, hosted on windows. for trying, wet my feet, etc. windows does the media stuff fine for me, so i don't need to bother getting that to work in the linux installation.
2005-01-02T12:18:00.000Z	|QuaD-	Blackwell	why not just install ubuntu and get rid of windows
2005-01-02T12:19:00.000Z	Blackwell	|QuaD-	because i am very comfortable with windows and because i don't want to go through the pains that some of the people in here are going through. i am not forced to concern myself with how to get media stuff going on linux that way, and a million other small things.
2005-01-02T12:19:00.000Z	Blackwell	|QuaD-	besides - i am not yet fed up with half-life 2.
2005-01-02T12:19:00.000Z	|QuaD-	Blackwell	thats never a concern :)
2005-01-02T12:20:00.000Z	|QuaD-	Blackwell	thats the reason
2005-01-02T12:20:00.000Z	Blackwell	|QuaD-	...i have been in this channel for too long to fall for that "no problems with anything on linux" sermon :)
2005-01-02T12:20:00.000Z	|QuaD-	Blackwell	if you know what you are doing... there are rarely problems
2005-01-02T12:21:00.000Z	Blackwell	|QuaD-	yes, exactly like in windows.
2005-01-02T12:21:00.000Z	|QuaD-	Blackwell	yup
