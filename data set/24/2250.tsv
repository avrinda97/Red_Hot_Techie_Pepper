2009-05-18T06:14:00.000Z	Lint01	Gourlis	check this -> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RadeonDriver
2009-05-25T22:52:00.000Z	Lint01	Gourlis	which card?
2009-05-25T22:53:00.000Z	Gourlis	Lint01	With Recovery tools I did on Ubuntu, my pc works better without effects enabled. But which I have to enable ? ATI on Hardware Drivers shown or the default by Ubuntu ?
2009-05-25T22:53:00.000Z	Lint01	Gourlis	which ATI do you have?
2009-05-25T22:54:00.000Z	Gourlis	Lint01	ATI Radeon RS490M X1250 on Ubuntu 8.04
2009-05-25T22:54:00.000Z	Lint01	Gourlis	It was great with proprietary (fglrx) driver for me
2009-05-25T22:54:00.000Z	Gourlis	Lint01	on Ubuntu in Hardware Drivers it shows me "ATI accelerated graphics driver"
2009-05-25T22:55:00.000Z	Gourlis	Lint01	you say not to enable that which says in Hardware drivers right ?
2009-05-25T22:56:00.000Z	Lint01	Gourlis	enable it, it should enable all 3D wonders
