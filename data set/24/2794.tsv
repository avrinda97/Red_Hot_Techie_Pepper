2008-08-23T01:26:00.000Z	WDC		Having hard drive issues, need to reinstall, AND save files. How do I mount my normal partition to save the files, when it says: mount: can't find /dev/sda1 in /etc/fstab or /etc/mtab
2008-08-23T01:27:00.000Z	WDC		What does: mount: can't find /dev/sda1 in /etc/fstab or /etc/mtab mean, and how do I fix it
2008-08-23T01:28:00.000Z	rconan	WDC	you need to specify a mount point either in your mount command or in /etc/fstab
2008-08-23T01:28:00.000Z	WDC	rconan	Like how
2008-08-23T01:29:00.000Z	rconan	WDC	what are you trying to do?
2008-08-23T01:29:00.000Z	WDC	rconan	Save my files, because the OS is corrupted!
2008-08-23T01:30:00.000Z	WDC	rconan	I'm on a Live CD right now, my Regular Ubuntu.
2008-08-23T01:30:00.000Z	WDC	rconan	I got it now.
2008-08-23T01:39:00.000Z	rconan	WDC	winamp is getting worse every release wheras most linux players are getting better
2008-08-23T01:39:00.000Z	rconan	WDC	imo at least
2008-08-23T01:39:00.000Z	WDC	rconan	5.54 was awesome.
2008-08-23T01:40:00.000Z	rconan	WDC	also i think winamp under wine+linux beats winamp under windows
2008-08-23T01:40:00.000Z	WDC	rconan	I loled. I tried that, but the "Media Player" Tab displayed nothing
2008-08-23T01:40:00.000Z	rconan	WDC	i can't say i've ever tried it but i know it was supposed to work at some point
2008-08-23T01:40:00.000Z	WDC	rconan	hmmm.
2008-08-23T01:41:00.000Z	WDC	rconan	I am ready to go back to windows
2008-08-23T01:41:00.000Z	WDC	rconan	After a week and a half of Linux, I have had WAY to many errors just getting the system to restart
2008-08-23T01:41:00.000Z	rconan	WDC	wierd
2008-08-23T01:42:00.000Z	WDC	rconan	I have to, it will just lock up because it goes into "read-only" harddrive
2008-08-23T01:42:00.000Z	rconan	WDC	wierd, are you running hardy?
2008-08-23T01:42:00.000Z	WDC	rconan	So I much force restart and then it says, cannot start X.
2008-08-23T01:42:00.000Z	WDC	rconan	yes
2008-08-23T01:43:00.000Z	rconan	WDC	never heard of an error like that
2008-08-23T01:43:00.000Z	WDC	rconan	I love linux to DEATH, but with the recent errors, not worth it
