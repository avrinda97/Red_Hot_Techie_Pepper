2006-07-25T14:38:00.000Z	helpplz		how can I use ALSA wrapper for oss apps? I dont even know what to download
2006-07-25T14:38:00.000Z	gyaresu	helpplz	have you read the alsa howto? alsa-oss is pretty normal these days.
2006-07-25T14:39:00.000Z	helpplz	gyaresu	nope.. it maybe pretty normal but im new to linux and trying to get sound in quake running <3
2006-07-25T14:40:00.000Z	gyaresu	helpplz	ah-ha. wait one.
2006-07-25T14:41:00.000Z	helpplz	gyaresu	wait one second?
2006-07-25T14:41:00.000Z	gyaresu	helpplz	yep.
2006-07-25T14:41:00.000Z	helpplz	gyaresu	alrighty
2006-07-25T14:48:00.000Z	gyaresu	helpplz	I've got this one in a script I use to start quake "quake4 +set s_driver oss  CMI8738MC8 +set s_numberOfSpeakers 2"
2006-07-25T14:48:00.000Z	helpplz	gyaresu	I use quake3 though.. would that still work?

2006-07-25T14:50:00.000Z	gyaresu	helpplz	the NOT RECOMMENDED bit is what i was looking for. should fix it.
2006-07-25T14:51:00.000Z	helpplz	gyaresu	I dont remember if one of those was the same command I tried but when I tried it the sound worked and when I tried to enter a game it would freeze like a screen shot
2006-07-25T14:52:00.000Z	helpplz	gyaresu	I mean awhile back..
2006-07-25T14:53:00.000Z	gyaresu	helpplz	did you try installing other sound servers like arts etc. ? cause that may also have been why it didn't work.
2006-07-25T14:53:00.000Z	helpplz	gyaresu	even the person on there had the same isse
2006-07-25T14:53:00.000Z	helpplz	gyaresu	no I havent.. how might I do it?
2006-07-25T14:53:00.000Z	gyaresu	helpplz	no don't.
2006-07-25T14:53:00.000Z	helpplz	gyaresu	install arts etc.?
2006-07-25T14:54:00.000Z	gyaresu	helpplz	throwing more at it isn't the answer it just makes it more messy. part of the problem of 'trying everything'
2006-07-25T14:55:00.000Z	helpplz	gyaresu	well I thought the alsa wrapper may help it out cause it sais that same sound error everyone gets and with the help of the wrapper it would allow access to /dev or w/e.. unless you know of another way
2006-07-25T15:05:00.000Z	helpplz	gyaresu	am I dead in the water then? are you not there anymore
2006-07-25T15:05:00.000Z	gyaresu	helpplz	i'm here but also doing some 'real' work. what's going on?
2006-07-25T15:06:00.000Z	helpplz	gyaresu	the q3 no sound? I didnt know you ended the convo.
2006-07-25T15:07:00.000Z	gyaresu	helpplz	sorry. thought you were trying the pcmcp0 trick.
