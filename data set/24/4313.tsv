2011-05-31T17:47:00.000Z	phaidros	anass	sudo a2enmod rewrite ?
2011-05-31T17:48:00.000Z	anass	phaidros	I did this but no effect!
2011-05-31T17:48:00.000Z	phaidros	anass	restarted apache ?
2011-05-31T17:48:00.000Z	anass	phaidros	yes, I did!
2011-05-31T17:49:00.000Z	phaidros	anass	does "sudo a2enmod" say something about rewrite ?

2011-05-31T17:51:00.000Z	anass	phaidros	I put a .htaccess with rewriteMod on, but no effect in this folder!

2011-05-31T17:55:00.000Z	anass	phaidros	OK, I'll search more
2011-05-31T17:55:00.000Z	phaidros	anass	yepp
2011-05-31T17:55:00.000Z	phaidros	anass	start with a proper apache vhost conf, as soon as that works, go into detail with rewrite etc
