2009-11-29T06:36:00.000Z	joshritger		I have an old Gateway solo 1450 laptop from around 2002, I have been trying to install xubuntu or a derivative of ubuntu on the laptop. The problem I am having is that with 8.04 my wifi card doesn't work, but with 9,04 and 9.10 the graphics are buggy. I get artifacting in 9.04 and a flashing screen in 9.10 but the wifi card works. I am currently installing 8.10 and want to know if I can still get the updates for it
2009-11-29T06:37:00.000Z	Black_Phantom	joshritger	the death date of 8.10 is on April 2010
2009-11-29T06:38:00.000Z	joshritger	Black_Phantom	thanks, I will make an apt on cd to back up the updates
2009-11-29T06:38:00.000Z	joshritger	Black_Phantom	do you have any idea why the graphics would have regressed with a newer release?
2009-11-29T06:38:00.000Z	Black_Phantom	joshritger	No problem; Good idea.
2009-11-29T06:39:00.000Z	Black_Phantom	joshritger	what graphic card do you use ?
2009-11-29T06:39:00.000Z	joshritger	Black_Phantom	I am not really sure, it is in an old laptop, some intel based card, not really sure which model
2009-11-29T06:40:00.000Z	joshritger	Black_Phantom	how would I check this through the terminal?
2009-11-29T06:40:00.000Z	Black_Phantom	joshritger	try "sudo lspci |more"
2009-11-29T06:41:00.000Z	joshritger	Black_Phantom	will try, to look it up, will take me a few min, currently installing it right now
2009-11-29T06:42:00.000Z	Black_Phantom	joshritger	cool
2009-11-29T07:05:00.000Z	joshritger	Black_Phantom	I got 8.10 to install on the laptop, I ran the command you told me to run to check the graphics chipset, and it is a intel 82830 chipset
2009-11-29T07:09:00.000Z	Black_Phantom	joshritger	one moment
2009-11-29T07:09:00.000Z	joshritger	Black_Phantom	np
2009-11-29T07:11:00.000Z	Black_Phantom	joshritger	how is the graphics working ?
2009-11-29T07:12:00.000Z	Black_Phantom	joshritger	try "sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-video-intel"
2009-11-29T07:12:00.000Z	joshritger	Black_Phantom	the graphics run fine on 8.04 and 8.10, but the last two releases have video problems
2009-11-29T07:13:00.000Z	Black_Phantom	joshritger	I guess that is because they marked them as restricted drivers on 9.04 & 9.10, did you check 'Hardware drivers' in System > Admin > Hardware drivers and check if they were restricted ?
2009-11-29T07:14:00.000Z	joshritger	Black_Phantom	I checked for restricted drivers in the newer releases and got nothing
2009-11-29T07:14:00.000Z	Black_Phantom	joshritger	did you try "sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-video-intel" ?
2009-11-29T07:15:00.000Z	Black_Phantom	joshritger	I dont think you can test it on the live cd, since when you reboot ( which you need when you install the driver ) it will reset everything back
2009-11-29T07:16:00.000Z	joshritger	Black_Phantom	oh, didn't think of that, I will try reinstalling 9.10 and then try to instasll the intel driver how you told me to, I will let you know if that works
2009-11-29T07:18:00.000Z	Black_Phantom	joshritger	if it didnt we have a choice to download the driver from Intel's website and to compile it manually :)
2009-11-29T07:19:00.000Z	joshritger	Black_Phantom	ok, thanks, will be back after it installs
