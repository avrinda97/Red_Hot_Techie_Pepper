2011-09-20T04:14:00.000Z	jason_hudson		Hi everyone, I need to dualboot windows 7 and Ubuntu and need to install windows 7 from an usb stick, actually tho I have no BIOS option to boot from an USB stick, I happen to see that someone managed to "achieve" this using grub, what would i have to do to make grub2 boot the windows installer from the usb stick?
2011-09-20T04:16:00.000Z	urlin2u	jason_hudson	http://www.plop.at/  easier then using grub
2011-09-20T04:25:00.000Z	urlin2u	jason_hudson	can you boot a diss?
2011-09-20T04:26:00.000Z	jason_hudson	urlin2u	yes but don't have windows one
2011-09-20T04:26:00.000Z	urlin2u	jason_hudson	look at the plop link it is for using a disc to boot the thumb.
2011-09-20T04:28:00.000Z	jason_hudson	urlin2u	that stuff is closed sourced tho, and i hear grub2 which is open can do it

2011-09-20T04:28:00.000Z	jason_hudson	urlin2u	having a look, thanks for bearing with me
2011-09-20T04:28:00.000Z	urlin2u	jason_hudson	geez your installing windows and complaining about closed source , are you mad laddy. :D
2011-09-20T04:29:00.000Z	jason_hudson	urlin2u	windows is needed for a specific use, ubuntu which is the "trusted os" out of the 2 will handle "sensitive" data, better keep it as clean as possible
2011-09-20T04:30:00.000Z	urlin2u	jason_hudson	and that makes perfect sense, lol plop is a safe app.
2011-09-20T04:31:00.000Z	urlin2u	jason_hudson	it just boots the disc that is all it is not a install.
2011-09-20T04:33:00.000Z	jason_hudson	urlin2u	apparently tho windows won't boot that way
2011-09-20T04:34:00.000Z	urlin2u	jason_hudson	http://www.plop.at/en/bootmanager.html#noinstall
2011-09-20T04:36:00.000Z	urlin2u	jason_hudson	if you set up the windows 7 correctly on the thumb I would suspect it boots with plop,ntfs partiton extract W7 to it, and a boot flag.
2011-09-20T04:38:00.000Z	jason_hudson	urlin2u	ok I'll have a look at that thanks
2011-09-20T04:40:00.000Z	urlin2u	jason_hudson	you saw the iso from a partion link as well using grub2
2011-09-20T04:40:00.000Z	jason_hudson	urlin2u	you mean in the ubuntuforums thread?
2011-09-20T04:42:00.000Z	urlin2u	jason_hudson	yeah you may be right with the plop although I see claims to doing it, just might be tricky.
2011-09-20T04:44:00.000Z	jason_hudson	urlin2u	on the forums it was stated that such procedure does not support windows, i wonder if  an "update-grub" would do it as i actually saw it being listed after i installed grub into the usb stick, but for some reason the pc's grub did not start anymore (must've messed)
2011-09-20T04:45:00.000Z	urlin2u	jason_hudson	personally I would just get a dvd, unless that reader wont read that.
2011-09-20T04:45:00.000Z	jason_hudson	urlin2u	don't have one for that pc, not anymore and i'd have rather avoided to spend money on a new one, on such an old pc
2011-09-20T04:48:00.000Z	urlin2u	jason_hudson	W7 will adjust to low cpu and ram  but only so far, are you sure this is even a good idea?
2011-09-20T04:48:00.000Z	jason_hudson	urlin2u	cpu is fairly decent, ram too, I'll need windows for a short length of time i guess it's a "decent" idea
