2008-06-17T12:26:00.000Z	Jordan_U	almagest	Can you boot into recovery mode?
2008-06-17T12:27:00.000Z	Jordan_U	almagest	Can you boot into recovery mode?
2008-06-17T12:27:00.000Z	almagest	Jordan_U	no tried that, it stops after a while after having loaded some early debian into mem
2008-06-17T12:27:00.000Z	Jordan_U	almagest	Do you have a LiveCD ( any distribution ) ?
2008-06-17T12:28:00.000Z	almagest	Jordan_U	in 15 minutes i do. downloading now
2008-06-17T12:28:00.000Z	Jordan_U	almagest	Ok, do you know how to perform a chroot?
2008-06-17T12:29:00.000Z	almagest	Jordan_U	not really. familiar with chmod etc, very different?
2008-06-17T12:31:00.000Z	Jordan_U	almagest	mount your Ubuntu partition to /mnt ( or anywhere you want, it doesn't matter ) then run: sudo mount -o bind /dev /mnt/dev && sudo mount -o bind /proc /mnt/proc && sudo chroot /mnt
2008-06-17T12:36:00.000Z	almagest	Jordan_U	i suspect the problem to be the hd + sd to only sd in feisty to be the problem. (according to googling)
2008-06-17T12:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U	almagest	Did you get my last message about how to do a chroot? ( also note that there are Free IRC clients for Windows, xchat has a windows version: http://www.silverex.org/download/ )
2008-06-17T12:38:00.000Z	almagest	Jordan_U	yes i did. im googling chroot now. snak (irc client) failed on me, i use a freeware one now.
2008-06-17T12:39:00.000Z	Jordan_U	almagest	mount your Ubuntu partition to /mnt ( or anywhere you want, it doesn't matter ) then run: sudo mount -o bind /dev /mnt/dev && sudo mount -o bind /proc /mnt/proc && sudo chroot /mnt
2008-06-17T12:40:00.000Z	almagest	Jordan_U	verifying the disc now, will try asap, thanks for helping
2008-06-17T12:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U	almagest	Once you are chrooted the first thing I would try is : sudo dpkg --configure -a
2008-06-17T12:48:00.000Z	almagest	Jordan_U	booting the cd now, here is a stupid q. should i choose "try ubuntu without any change.." , and open a terminal when done?
2008-06-17T12:49:00.000Z	Jordan_U	almagest	Yes
2008-06-17T12:58:00.000Z	Jordan_U	almagest	Have you setup the chroot yet?
2008-06-17T12:58:00.000Z	almagest	Jordan_U	just ran the dpkg command. it sets up alot of things now, what exactly did i just do?
2008-06-17T13:00:00.000Z	Jordan_U	almagest	You is finishing all of the package updates that were interrupted when the upgrade failed
2008-06-17T13:00:00.000Z	Jordan_U	almagest	*are :)
2008-06-17T13:01:00.000Z	Jordan_U	almagest	Hopefully when you reboot your system will be completely upgraded
2008-06-17T13:03:00.000Z	Jordan_U	almagest	I have to get some sleep now, good luck
2008-06-17T13:04:00.000Z	almagest	Jordan_U	you have no idea how important that would be. thanks for the help!
