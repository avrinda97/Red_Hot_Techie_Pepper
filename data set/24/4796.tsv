2007-04-22T09:07:00.000Z	Maximilian1st		Hi, the vmware-player package in ubuntu won't install here and worth of it, it won't uninstall and blocks other packages.
2007-04-22T09:08:00.000Z	Maximilian1st		!vmware-player
2007-04-22T09:09:00.000Z	LjL	Maximilian1st	pastebin the actual console output of the whole apt-get thing
2007-04-22T09:10:00.000Z	Maximilian1st	LjL	pastebin does not work here, don't know why...
2007-04-22T09:10:00.000Z	LjL	Maximilian1st	you mean the site doesn't load?
2007-04-22T09:11:00.000Z	LjL	Maximilian1st	"send"? it should just give you a page, and then you give me the URL of it
2007-04-22T09:11:00.000Z	LjL	Maximilian1st	anyway, try "pastebin" on google, there are others around
2007-04-22T09:11:00.000Z	Maximilian1st	LjL	It says query failure...
2007-04-22T09:12:00.000Z	LjL	Maximilian1st	*shrug* works for me right now
2007-04-22T09:12:00.000Z	LjL	Maximilian1st	there's http://pastebin.ca/ for instance
2007-04-22T09:12:00.000Z	Maximilian1st	LjL	Query failure: Can't open file: 'pastebin.MYI'. (errno: 145)
2007-04-22T09:13:00.000Z	LjL	Maximilian1st	could just be a temporary glitch, have you tried again? anyway, use pastebin.ca if it keeps doing that
2007-04-22T09:13:00.000Z	Maximilian1st	LjL	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/17070/
2007-04-22T09:13:00.000Z	Maximilian1st	LjL	I tried a few times... Now I found this ubuntu paste bin
2007-04-22T09:14:00.000Z	LjL	Maximilian1st	?! that *is* our pastebin
2007-04-22T09:14:00.000Z	LjL	Maximilian1st	it's the one i've been talking about all along.
2007-04-22T09:14:00.000Z	LjL	Maximilian1st	try reading the channel topic :P
2007-04-22T09:14:00.000Z	Maximilian1st	LjL	Sorry for that.
2007-04-22T09:16:00.000Z	Maximilian1st	LjL	This happened to me before and I found some info on the ubuntu forums that helped get rid of the problem. Yet I am amazed that it does not install at all and is so hard to remove. Am I the only one trying to install the player?
2007-04-22T09:17:00.000Z	LjL	Maximilian1st	it installed ok for me. the problem seems to be network related, like the subnet that vmplayer tries to use is busy or something. give me 1) the output of "cat /etc/network/interfaces"  and 2) try "sudo invoke-rc.d vmware-player stop" followed by the dpkg -r again
2007-04-22T09:21:00.000Z	Maximilian1st	LjL	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/17071/
2007-04-22T09:24:00.000Z	Maximilian1st	LjL	I will try plugging in the cable for the wired connection.
2007-04-22T09:24:00.000Z	LjL	Maximilian1st	no, won't be any use
2007-04-22T09:26:00.000Z	LjL	Maximilian1st	if you type  sudo apt-get dist-upgrade , does it complain about anything?
