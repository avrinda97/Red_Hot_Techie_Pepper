2010-03-15T01:19:00.000Z	Desciero		Let's say I want to move a game file, like a user made map, to an installed game. When I drag it to the destination folder for the game, it says I don't have the administrative control to do that. How do I allow my user to move files?
2010-03-15T01:21:00.000Z	Desciero		ok
2010-03-15T01:23:00.000Z	histo	Desciero	jest extract where ever you want.
2010-03-15T01:36:00.000Z	histo	Desciero	what game are you tryign to install?
2010-03-15T01:37:00.000Z	Desciero	histo	I've already installed Battle for Wesnoth using the software center
2010-03-15T01:37:00.000Z	Desciero	histo	I'm simply trying to add a usermade map to its files
2010-03-15T01:37:00.000Z	histo	Desciero	just find the maps folder
2010-03-15T01:38:00.000Z	histo	Desciero	its probably hidden in your home.
2010-03-15T01:38:00.000Z	histo	Desciero	open nautilus and hit ctrl+h to show the hidden files.  Or find otu where you are supposed to put homemade maps.
2010-03-15T01:38:00.000Z	Desciero	histo	ya...the maps folder is in usr/share/games/wesnoth/data/multiplayer/scenarios
2010-03-15T01:38:00.000Z	Desciero	histo	but it wont let me drag the file there
2010-03-15T01:39:00.000Z	Desciero	histo	Error moving file: Permission denied
2010-03-15T01:39:00.000Z	histo	Desciero	open a terminal and sudo cp filename /usr/share/games/wesnorth/data/multiplayer/scenarios
2010-03-15T01:39:00.000Z	Desciero	histo	when you say "home" what are you referring to? where is my "home?"
2010-03-15T01:39:00.000Z	histo	Desciero	or alt+f2 and gksu nautilus
2010-03-15T01:40:00.000Z	histo	Desciero	do the last suggeston alt+f2 and type in gksu nautilus and hit enter. That will give youa root file browser
2010-03-15T01:41:00.000Z	histo	Desciero	/home/desciero  or whatever your username is on the box /home/username
2010-03-15T01:42:00.000Z	Desciero	histo	did that and all it brings up is a desktop
2010-03-15T01:42:00.000Z	histo	Desciero	does it say root filebrowser at the top?
2010-03-15T01:43:00.000Z	histo	Desciero	go up a folder
2010-03-15T01:43:00.000Z	histo	Desciero	browse to where you saved the map file probably in /home/username somewhere.
2010-03-15T01:43:00.000Z	histo	Desciero	and copy and paste it where you need to.  Or drag from antoher window
2010-03-15T01:48:00.000Z	Desciero	histo	the problem is not finding the file...it is not being able to get that file to where it needs to go
2010-03-15T01:48:00.000Z	Desciero	histo	and it needs to go somewhere I don't have access to
