2008-03-05T02:19:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter		hello is there a way to set evolution to show emails by accounts, instead of showing all the emails in one inbox?
2008-03-05T02:21:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter		anyone here uses evolution?
2008-03-05T02:22:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	Pirate_Hunter	I do
2008-03-05T02:23:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Odd-rationale	how do you set emails to show by accounts instead of showing it all in one inbox?
2008-03-05T02:23:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	Pirate_Hunter	I only have one account, so never tried...
2008-03-05T02:24:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Odd-rationale	np just wondered cause its annoying having all accounts in one inbox
2009-01-11T06:26:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	Pirate_Hunter	you reattach by running mocp. and yes you can use commands to control moc without it open.
2009-01-11T06:29:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Odd-rationale	thanx needed to make sure on the -h page i only found how to detach :p, what would be the standard command in terminal to play next song in moc?
2009-01-11T06:29:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	Pirate_Hunter	mocp -f (play next song)
2009-01-11T06:30:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	Pirate_Hunter	try mocp --help
2009-01-11T06:31:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Odd-rationale	im reading the man page and there is no explanation in running moc through terminal
2009-01-11T06:32:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	Pirate_Hunter	what do you mean?
2009-01-11T06:33:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Odd-rationale	np just worked out how to do it wasnt thinking nvm
2009-01-11T06:33:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	Pirate_Hunter	:) np
2009-01-11T06:35:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Odd-rationale	i wonder if wmii window option can do the same now that would be awesome (which apparently is also a tilling/panel wm smaller than wmii)
2009-01-11T06:36:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	Pirate_Hunter	wmii do what?
2009-01-11T06:37:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Odd-rationale	nvm it cant do it i have to use terminal ahh that would be too much to aks for
2009-01-11T06:37:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	Pirate_Hunter	sorry, i'm a bit lost as to what you are/were trying to do...
2009-01-11T06:38:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Odd-rationale	if i use mod4+p it calls up menu which i thought acted like terminal apparantely it doesnt so i cant control moc like that which is a shame
2009-01-11T06:39:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	Pirate_Hunter	oh, you mean dmenu?
2009-01-11T06:41:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Odd-rationale	huh? whats that i just started using wmii today for like an hour i think so wouldnt know what that is
2009-01-11T06:41:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	Pirate_Hunter	you know what, that is a good idea! i think i'll setup my mocp to be controlled from dmenu too :)
2009-01-11T06:42:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	Pirate_Hunter	this is somewhat off-topic... would you like to pm me? or vice versa?
2009-01-11T06:42:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Odd-rationale	u pm plz im still dont know how to pm on irssi *dont laugh*
