2009-05-08T05:21:00.000Z	^Phantom^		i wouldn't swear if i wasn't mad
2009-05-08T05:21:00.000Z	mneptok	^Phantom^	you won;t swear in this channel, period.
2009-05-08T05:23:00.000Z	mneptok	^Phantom^	what about "you won't swear" was ambiguous?
2009-05-08T05:24:00.000Z	mneptok	^Phantom^	what kind of file is it?
2009-05-08T05:24:00.000Z	mneptok	^Phantom^	what is the file extension?
2009-05-08T05:24:00.000Z	^Phantom^	mneptok	download the emulator and look for yourself
2009-05-08T05:25:00.000Z	mneptok	^Phantom^	the KDE file manager?

2009-05-08T05:27:00.000Z	^Phantom^	mneptok	 so, do you see what i have now?
2009-05-08T05:28:00.000Z	mneptok	^Phantom^	i have a feeling you'll need more than just a single file. my guess is that you will need tons of supporting libraries.
2009-05-08T05:28:00.000Z	mneptok	^Phantom^	have you tried asking for help in their forums?
2009-05-08T05:29:00.000Z	mneptok	^Phantom^	all those libraries are going to need to be put into the proper locations
2009-05-08T05:30:00.000Z	mneptok	^Phantom^	not to metion this looks like software for Windows
2009-05-08T05:32:00.000Z	mneptok	^Phantom^	the whole project is a waste of time unless you have thousands of dollars of hardware. the GC and Wii have specialized video hardware that a PC will *struggle* to keep up with.
2011-02-16T13:10:00.000Z	mneptok	^Phantom^	gksu gifsicle
2011-02-16T13:11:00.000Z	mneptok	^Phantom^	GUI apps get run with gksu, not sudo, i have no idea what gifsicle does.
2011-02-16T13:11:00.000Z	^Phantom^	mneptok	here is the description from Ubuntu Software Center "This is a tool for manipulating GIF image files. It has good support for transparency and colormap manipulation, simple image transformations (cropping, flipping), and creating, deconstructing, and editing GIF animations, which it can also optimize for space."
2011-02-16T13:12:00.000Z	mneptok	^Phantom^	OK, i just use The GIMP :)
2011-02-16T13:13:00.000Z	^Phantom^	mneptok	I would imagine maybe gifsicle is missing a front-end?
2011-02-16T13:14:00.000Z	mneptok	^Phantom^	i have never used the app. i just know that GUI apps can complain about sudo, and gksu should be used.
2011-02-16T13:14:00.000Z	^Phantom^	mneptok	Ah, okay thank you.  I have learned more about ubuntu tonight.  ^_^
