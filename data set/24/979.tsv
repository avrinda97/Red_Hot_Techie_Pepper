2010-09-27T05:01:00.000Z	edbian	|2exx	Absolutely!  sudo nano /etc/hosts   :)
2010-09-27T05:01:00.000Z	|2exx	edbian	E: Package gksudo has no installation candidate
2010-09-27T05:01:00.000Z	edbian	|2exx	mmm, odd.  I'm not sure what package it's in.  All it does is sudo graphically

2010-09-27T05:02:00.000Z	|2exx		i'll try gksu

2010-09-27T05:06:00.000Z	edbian	|2exx	You want to overwrite it.  Assuming the file looks how you want it.
