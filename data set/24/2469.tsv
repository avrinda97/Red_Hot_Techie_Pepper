2012-11-03T20:01:00.000Z	bazhang	dougl	we seem to be missing a part of your sources.list
2012-11-03T20:04:00.000Z	dougl	bazhang	is http://pastebin.com/SQAacUw1 more complete?
2012-11-03T20:05:00.000Z	bazhang	dougl	I dont see the launchpad ppa that is causing the errors
2012-11-03T20:06:00.000Z	dougl	bazhang	but you see the errors in the first pastebin post?
2012-11-03T20:06:00.000Z	bazhang	dougl	yep
2012-11-03T20:06:00.000Z	dougl	bazhang	looks like 12.10 is broken?
2012-11-03T20:07:00.000Z	dougl	bazhang	my 12.10 is broken?
2012-11-03T20:07:00.000Z	bazhang	dougl	no. try the ppa-purge
2012-11-03T20:08:00.000Z	bazhang	dougl	a simple error like that does not indicate broken, by any stretch of the imagination
2012-11-03T20:08:00.000Z	dougl	bazhang	broken too strong but for lack of a better term
2012-11-03T20:09:00.000Z	dougl	bazhang	I don't think that issue will have any effect on my system but that is one of many
2012-11-03T20:09:00.000Z	bazhang	dougl	perhaps check in synaptic package manager
