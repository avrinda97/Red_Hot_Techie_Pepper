2008-04-05T21:12:00.000Z	Mudassar		there is no way to increase the cache size in mozilla
2008-04-05T21:13:00.000Z	Mudassar		I have done it many times
2008-04-05T21:13:00.000Z	Mudassar		but problem happens
2008-04-05T21:14:00.000Z	soundray	Mudassar	then I'd suggest you start with a completely new firefox configuration. Stop firefox and run 'mv ~/.mozilla ~/mozillaconfig-backup'
2008-05-05T01:50:00.000Z	soundray	Mudassar	make sure you don't have any other plugins for flash installed that may be competing with the Adobe one.
2008-05-05T01:57:00.000Z	soundray	Mudassar	don't paste into the channel please. Remove gnash from your system.
2008-05-05T01:57:00.000Z	soundray	Mudassar	gnash will conflict with Adobe's flash plugin
2008-05-05T01:58:00.000Z	soundray	Mudassar	with the package manager you prefer. Try synaptic
2008-05-05T02:03:00.000Z	soundray	Mudassar	restart your browser
2008-05-05T02:05:00.000Z	soundray	Mudassar	restart your browser
2008-05-05T02:06:00.000Z	soundray	Mudassar	try this: 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure flashplugin-nonfree'
2008-05-05T02:07:00.000Z	soundray	Mudassar	if there are errors, please put them on the pastebin and give us the URL
2008-05-05T02:13:00.000Z	soundray	Mudassar	did the reconfigure step fix it?
2008-05-05T02:14:00.000Z	Mudassar	soundray	thanks
2008-05-05T02:14:00.000Z	soundray	Mudassar	good to know, thanks
2008-05-05T02:19:00.000Z	soundray	Mudassar	double click the volume icon in the panel to open the mixer. There should be a slider that controls the headphone volume.
2008-05-05T02:21:00.000Z	soundray	Mudassar	do you get extra sliders when you run alsamixer in a terminal?
2008-05-05T02:24:00.000Z	soundray	Mudassar	see if any sliders affect the headphones volume. You will see more sliders if you hit the right arrow key.
2008-05-05T02:27:00.000Z	soundray	Mudassar	I don't know what to suggest -- have a look at the help pages please -- see factoid:
2008-05-09T21:27:00.000Z	soundray	Mudassar	you can file a wishlist bug
2008-05-09T21:28:00.000Z	soundray	Mudassar	see what ubottu said ^^
