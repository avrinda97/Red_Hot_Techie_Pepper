2005-04-09T09:15:00.000Z	lewwy		dont suppose gunzip does rar?
2005-04-09T09:15:00.000Z	lewwy		or any decompressing tool that comes with linux does rar?
2005-04-09T09:15:00.000Z	tritium	lewwy	there's info on that on ubuntuguide.org
2005-04-09T09:32:00.000Z	tritium	lewwy	install java-package, then download Sun's j2re .bin, then build your own .deb
2005-04-09T09:33:00.000Z	tritium	lewwy	LeeJunFan: http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/Java (Method 2)
2005-04-09T09:37:00.000Z	tritium	lewwy	Method 2?
2005-04-09T09:40:00.000Z	tritium	lewwy	I have a 29MB sun-j2re1.5_1.5.0+update01_i386.deb that I built if you want it
2005-04-09T09:44:00.000Z	tritium	lewwy	did you see my offer?
2005-04-09T09:45:00.000Z	tritium	lewwy	my 29MB j2re .deb that I built
2005-04-09T09:45:00.000Z	tritium	lewwy	 one moment
2005-04-09T09:46:00.000Z	tritium	lewwy	for i386
2005-04-09T10:07:00.000Z	tritium	lewwy	there's a "shipit" link on the ubuntu homepage
2005-04-09T10:14:00.000Z	tritium	lewwy	you're still downloading my java package?
2005-04-09T10:15:00.000Z	tritium	lewwy	you have a slow connection then ;)
2005-04-11T07:36:00.000Z	tritium	lewwy	did you have build-essential installed?
2005-04-11T07:37:00.000Z	tritium	lewwy	okay, that's good
2005-04-11T07:38:00.000Z	lewwy	tritium	you want me to post the error into flood?
2005-04-11T07:38:00.000Z	tritium	lewwy	I can take a look
2005-04-11T07:50:00.000Z	tritium	lewwy	yes?
2005-04-11T07:51:00.000Z	lewwy	tritium	did you look at my cedega problem? can it be fixed?
2005-04-11T07:51:00.000Z	tritium	lewwy	I asked about the configure script, and what libs are necessary to compile
2005-04-11T07:53:00.000Z	tritium	lewwy	I can't really say for sure without looking at it myself
2005-04-11T07:55:00.000Z	tritium	lewwy	no, I don't think it'll help much.  There are no details anywhere on required libs?
2005-04-11T07:56:00.000Z	tritium	lewwy	that would be my first recommendation.  The first error points to a missing library most likely
