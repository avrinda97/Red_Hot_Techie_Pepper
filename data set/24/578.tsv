2011-06-03T22:10:00.000Z	nadim		Is there anything in a vanilla Lucid that blocks incoming port 80 connections (netstat notes that its listening)
2011-06-03T22:10:00.000Z	n8wulf	nadim	there shouldn't be
2011-06-03T22:11:00.000Z	nadim	n8wulf	what's the best way to debug this then - as noted I removed my router and am connected straight to the cable modem - ISP notes not blocking anything, what can I do next ?
2011-06-03T22:13:00.000Z	n8wulf	nadim	sorry mate, just describe your issue again, can't find it now
2011-06-03T22:14:00.000Z	nadim	n8wulf	been having a REALLY tough time with apache2 (on lucid) - I thought it was the router, so I removed it and am now connected straight into the cable modem, the ISP (cox) says they are not blocking ports but I can't seem to be able to access port 80 from the outside - localhost works just fine.  Ideas ?
2011-06-03T22:15:00.000Z	n8wulf	nadim	maybe a quick workaround would be to install No-IP?
2011-06-03T22:16:00.000Z	n8wulf	nadim	are you trying to a Local Hosted webpage from Public?
2011-06-03T22:16:00.000Z	nadim	n8wulf	No-IP as in no-ip.org ?  Sorry not following...
2011-06-03T22:16:00.000Z	n8wulf	nadim	no-ip.com
2011-06-03T22:17:00.000Z	nadim	n8wulf	yeah, I installed apache2 and can see the "It works" from localhost (ie. 127.0.0.1) but if I try to access my IP_address from the outside (ie. the internet) I don't get through - ssh works fine, vnc works fine, if I look at the apache logs so access entry, etc - its simply not coming through from the looks of it
2011-06-03T22:19:00.000Z	nadim	n8wulf	it very much looks like its being blocked but where - the ISP says "not me", I removed the router (so its just the ISP's cable modem) and the lucid box - so what can I do further to debug this ?
2011-06-03T22:20:00.000Z	n8wulf	nadim	I'm thinking... but it feels like I'm Sinking
2011-06-03T22:20:00.000Z	nadim	n8wulf	hehe
2011-06-03T22:21:00.000Z	nadim	n8wulf	ok, tried something else and that worked
2011-06-03T22:21:00.000Z	n8wulf	nadim	what did you try?
2011-06-03T22:21:00.000Z	nadim	n8wulf	instead of 80 I modified apache2 to use 3389 (just for grins) and that works fine - I can see the "It works"
2011-06-03T22:21:00.000Z	nadim	n8wulf	so port 80 is definintly  being blocked but where and how
2011-06-03T22:22:00.000Z	n8wulf	nadim	cool man!
2011-06-03T22:23:00.000Z	n8wulf	nadim	I'm not allowed to type my thoughts
2011-06-03T22:23:00.000Z	nadim	n8wulf	is there ANYTHING within lucid that might be blocking port 80 ? I don't have a firewall installed/used
2011-06-03T22:25:00.000Z	n8wulf	nadim	I should think not, no reason to be, lemme just remember quick, there is a site somewhere that allows u to test all open Ports on your IP
2011-06-03T22:25:00.000Z	n8wulf	nadim	will get back to u just now
2011-06-03T22:26:00.000Z	nadim	n8wulf	tried canyouseeme.com and it said that 80 is no visiable from outside (what else is new :-) the question is how best to debug this
