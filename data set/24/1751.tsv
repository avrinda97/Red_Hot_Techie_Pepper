2010-09-06T14:41:00.000Z	tasslehoff		where does "uname -a" take it's info from? /boot?
2010-09-06T14:42:00.000Z	ikonia	tasslehoff	from the running ker el
2010-09-06T14:43:00.000Z	tasslehoff	ikonia	hm. does grub take the kernel from /boot?
2010-09-06T14:44:00.000Z	tasslehoff	ikonia	I installed 32-bit Ubuntu, but uname -a says x86_64. It failed installing grub and used an old /boot from my previous 64-bit install
2010-09-06T14:48:00.000Z	ikonia	tasslehoff	your running 64bit
2010-09-06T15:15:00.000Z	tasslehoff	ikonia	yep, but the issue is that the install didn't touch the /boot partition. so it loads a 64-bit kernel, but my everything in my install expects 32-bit
2011-04-05T20:16:00.000Z	ikonia	tasslehoff	no
2011-04-05T20:16:00.000Z	ikonia	tasslehoff	yes, they are skype version numbers
2011-04-05T20:16:00.000Z	tasslehoff	ikonia	I know, I was just hoping they were odd enough to use different version numbrs on different platforms :)
2011-09-14T12:44:00.000Z	ikonia	tasslehoff	got to be a firewall
2011-09-14T12:44:00.000Z	ikonia	tasslehoff	or your browsing the web with a proxy
2011-09-14T12:46:00.000Z	tasslehoff	ikonia	Younder: it happened after I upgraded from 10.10 to 11.04.
2011-09-14T12:50:00.000Z	ikonia	tasslehoff	then it's being firewalled
2011-09-14T12:51:00.000Z	tasslehoff	ikonia	perhaps I got a new IP when I upgraded
2011-09-14T13:09:00.000Z	tasslehoff	ikonia	Younder: ping was indeed blocked in our firewall, and pidgin didn't work because it tried to use Gnome Proxy settings.
2011-09-28T15:13:00.000Z	ikonia	tasslehoff	can't be done
2011-09-28T15:13:00.000Z	tasslehoff	ikonia	hmm. I'm quite certain I've done it before.
2011-09-28T15:14:00.000Z	ikonia	tasslehoff	good luck then
2011-09-28T15:15:00.000Z	tasslehoff	ikonia	thanks, it means a lot
2011-09-28T15:24:00.000Z	tasslehoff	ikonia	I only fixed grub, and never reinstalled Ubuntu, so I take that back. But if I manually unlock the encrypted partition, the installer can't be made to install to the logical volumes?
2012-09-12T14:10:00.000Z	ikonia	tasslehoff	I have it working on a T430s
2012-09-12T14:23:00.000Z	tasslehoff	ikonia	running discrete graphics only?
2012-09-12T14:32:00.000Z	tasslehoff	ikonia	with discrete graphics my t530 won't boot, and with integrated I can't make the minidisplayport work
2012-09-13T11:56:00.000Z	tasslehoff	ikonia	after installing nvidia-current, discrete graphics and minidisplayport work on my t530.
