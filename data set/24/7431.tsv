2005-01-29T17:41:00.000Z	hacim		[Phaedrus] : even playing things in rhythmbox doesn't work
2005-01-29T17:41:00.000Z	hacim		it seems like gnome gets "stuck" -- I launch the network config and nothing happens.... then like 5 minutes later it pops up
2005-01-29T17:41:00.000Z	hacim		[Phaedrus] : its annoying
2005-01-29T17:42:00.000Z	hacim		[Phaedrus] : and the load on the machine is not a problem, its obviously something goofed with gnome
2005-01-29T17:43:00.000Z	crimsun	hacim	what are your issues with audio cds and usb sound card?
2005-01-29T17:43:00.000Z	hacim	crimsun	its a laptop, no usb sound card, just a cdrom plugged in
2005-01-29T17:43:00.000Z	hacim	crimsun	any sound outside of the gnome sounds, do not work
2005-01-29T17:44:00.000Z	crimsun	hacim	are these sounds from non-gnome applications set to use some output other than esd?
2005-01-29T17:45:00.000Z	hacim	crimsun	I have no idea... I just run rhythmbox and try and play a radio station and it freezes... if I put in an audio CD it automatically plays but no audio happens
2005-01-29T17:47:00.000Z	crimsun	hacim	I haven't run the rhythmbox in Warty in some time; I presume you can get streaming music to play with, say, mpg123?
2005-01-29T17:49:00.000Z	hacim	crimsun	mpg123 seems to work
2005-01-29T17:51:00.000Z	crimsun	hacim	I know there are problems with streaming in Warty's rhythmbox; have you tried the 0.8.8 backport from http://ubuntu-bp.sourceforge.net/ ?
2005-01-29T17:56:00.000Z	hacim	crimsun	yeah, I just tried it... same thing :P
2005-01-29T17:56:00.000Z	hacim	crimsun	more importantly there is something screwed with gnome
2005-01-29T17:59:00.000Z	crimsun	hacim	I doubt it's related to the kernel at all. Rhythmbox seems to be the culprit. Have you tried with a newer version of the gnome cd player (e.g., the 'gnome-media' from Hoary)?
2005-01-29T17:59:00.000Z	crimsun	hacim	or have you tried another player, such as totem-xine or beep-media-player?
2005-01-29T06:00:00.000Z	hacim	crimsun	I am going to try and upgrade to hoary to see if the problems go away
2005-01-29T09:57:00.000Z	crimsun	hacim	that's fine.
2005-01-29T10:01:00.000Z	hacim	crimsun	totem-xine seems to play movies, but sound doesn't work
2005-01-29T10:01:00.000Z	crimsun	hacim	what's the sound configured as?
2005-01-29T10:02:00.000Z	hacim	crimsun	in totem?
2005-01-29T10:02:00.000Z	crimsun	hacim	totem-xine
2005-01-29T10:02:00.000Z	hacim	crimsun	maybe I am running just totem
2005-01-29T10:03:00.000Z	hacim	crimsun	I see no executable by the name of totem-xine
