2005-11-04T14:58:00.000Z	HappyFool	stevejesus	'man apt-key'
2005-11-04T14:59:00.000Z	stevejesus	HappyFool	 have you gotten these gpg errors from apt before?  is there a quick way to just grab them all and install them?
2005-11-04T14:59:00.000Z	HappyFool	stevejesus	no, i only use the standard repos and the keys come preinstalled
2005-11-04T14:59:00.000Z	HappyFool	stevejesus	there's an example on the wiki
2005-11-04T15:00:00.000Z	stevejesus	HappyFool	 can you point me toward the url?  i would appreciate it greatly.
2005-11-04T15:00:00.000Z	HappyFool	stevejesus	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AptAuthenticationInstructionsForHoary
2005-11-04T15:01:00.000Z	stevejesus	HappyFool	 thank you
2005-11-04T15:01:00.000Z	HappyFool	stevejesus	good luck
2005-11-04T15:03:00.000Z	stevejesus	HappyFool	 can i run apt-get sans gpg?  i mean, can i force apt to download and install without authentication?
2005-11-04T15:03:00.000Z	HappyFool	stevejesus	you should be able to
2005-11-04T15:03:00.000Z	HappyFool	stevejesus	it should ask y/n -- after asking if it's ok to download
2005-11-04T15:04:00.000Z	stevejesus	HappyFool	 thanks for the info.  the man apt page is pityful to say the least
2005-11-04T15:04:00.000Z	HappyFool	stevejesus	heh
2005-11-04T15:04:00.000Z	HappyFool	stevejesus	try 'man apt-get' and 'man aptitude'
2005-11-04T15:04:00.000Z	HappyFool	stevejesus	also read the apt-howto
2005-11-04T15:05:00.000Z	stevejesus	HappyFool	 any idea as to why it doesnt just work?
2005-11-04T15:05:00.000Z	stevejesus	HappyFool	 this is a fresh istall
2005-11-04T15:05:00.000Z	HappyFool	stevejesus	what doesn't just work ?
2005-11-04T15:06:00.000Z	stevejesus	HappyFool	 ap-get.  i have never had to fetch gpg keys in hoary, or a previous install of breezy
2005-11-04T15:06:00.000Z	HappyFool	stevejesus	try changing your repos to point at archive.ubuntu.com (instead of a mirror). and run 'apt-get update' a few times
2005-11-04T15:06:00.000Z	stevejesus	HappyFool	 i am very used to it in fedora though
2005-11-04T15:06:00.000Z	HappyFool	stevejesus	i had problems with unauthenticated packages now and then, but rerunning apt-get *usually* sorted them out
2005-11-04T15:07:00.000Z	HappyFool	stevejesus	if it persists, consider removing the downloaded package lists (but that is a hack, and should be done with care)
2005-11-18T14:44:00.000Z	HappyFool	stevejesus	what i'd do is create a new ext3 (or whatever) partition, copy /home across and mount /home at that new partition
