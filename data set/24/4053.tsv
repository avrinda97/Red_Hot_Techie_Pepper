2007-07-21T11:45:00.000Z	Flannel	ramp1	Linux doesn't use the same naming scheme as windows (C E F) it goes by partitions.  Is your E on it's own partition? or on it's own drive? or what?
2007-07-21T11:46:00.000Z	Flannel	ramp1	So, you have C and D as partitions both on the same harddrive?
2007-07-21T11:47:00.000Z	Flannel	ramp1	do you have a D drive as well?  C D E? all as the same harddrive?
2007-07-21T11:47:00.000Z	Flannel	ramp1	This is fine here, no need for private stuffs
2007-07-21T11:49:00.000Z	Flannel	ramp1	Alright, well, the best way to do it would be to, with the liveCD, mount and check each one.  Those would be hda1, hda2, hda3, and hda4.  Although they don't necessarily need to be in that order (although they probably are)
2007-07-21T11:49:00.000Z	Flannel	ramp1	then you'll know which partition you should use
2007-07-21T11:51:00.000Z	Flannel	ramp1	manual will work fine.  6.06, but yeah.
2007-07-21T11:52:00.000Z	Flannel	ramp1	yeah, you'll delete whichever partition you made, then recreate it as ext3, and then in the next screen use it as root (/)
2007-07-21T11:53:00.000Z	Flannel	ramp1	mount whatever partition you just made for linux as /
2007-07-21T11:55:00.000Z	Flannel	ramp1	no, /dev/sda6 is the partition you use, and then / is the place you mount it
2007-07-21T11:57:00.000Z	Flannel	ramp1	well, I may have the terminology wrong, but you want to use your partition you just made, and you want to use it for '/' ('root')
2007-07-21T11:59:00.000Z	Flannel	ramp1	Right, At the last screen (the format partition screen), I told you to delete one of those partitions (whichever you were going ot use for linux) and then make a new partition (as ext3) in the space you freed up
2007-07-21T12:15:00.000Z	Flannel	ramp1	sp3000, just click 'reformat', that'll delete and should allow you to pick a new FS
2007-07-21T12:16:00.000Z	Flannel	ramp1	sp3000, oh wait, I'm sorry.  You do need to delete (it's the red circle/X thing)
2007-07-21T12:17:00.000Z	Flannel	ramp1	you'll need to delete it and recreate it as ext3 though
2007-07-21T12:34:00.000Z	Flannel	ramp1	how much RAM do you have?
2007-07-21T12:36:00.000Z	Flannel	ramp1	You'll probably be fine without swap.  And if you find you need it, you can always add it in later.
2007-07-21T12:41:00.000Z	Flannel	ramp1	What about?
2007-07-21T12:43:00.000Z	Flannel	ramp1	Right, whats your question?  Don't worry about the swap space.  Just install to that partition
2007-07-21T13:01:00.000Z	Flannel	ramp1	if you find you're having problems without swap space, you can add it later.
2007-07-21T13:06:00.000Z	ramp1	Flannel	thanks for the help going to restart and see whether ubuntu works!!
