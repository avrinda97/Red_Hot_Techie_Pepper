2007-12-18T19:55:00.000Z	alexborsova	ikonia	hello
2007-12-18T19:56:00.000Z	ikonia	alexborsova	ahh hello
2007-12-18T19:56:00.000Z	ikonia	alexborsova	your cpu timing issue is quite awkward
2007-12-18T19:56:00.000Z	alexborsova	ikonia	yes, tell me about it
2007-12-18T19:56:00.000Z	ikonia	alexborsova	most of the research I found last night for your case pointed towards either power managment or overclocking, and you've not overclocked and you can't disable power managment
2007-12-18T19:56:00.000Z	alexborsova	ikonia	do you think there's anything I can do to make Ubuntu work on my laptop?
2007-12-18T19:57:00.000Z	alexborsova	ikonia	I'm not overclocking
2007-12-18T19:57:00.000Z	ikonia	alexborsova	is the problem only happening with your install or does it happen on the livecd too (I can't remember)
2007-12-18T19:57:00.000Z	alexborsova	ikonia	the live cd works only if I use the vga=771 option
2007-12-18T19:57:00.000Z	ikonia	alexborsova	oooh, thats interesting
2007-12-18T19:58:00.000Z	alexborsova	ikonia	I think I tiold you, if I use the (recovery mode) ffrom grub, I can type "startx" and that works
2007-12-18T19:58:00.000Z	alexborsova	ikonia	but when I use the default option that comes up in syslog and I get a blank screen
2007-12-18T19:58:00.000Z	ikonia	alexborsova	what happens if you do that on that on your install
2007-12-18T19:58:00.000Z	alexborsova	ikonia	what?
2007-12-18T19:59:00.000Z	alexborsova	ikonia	I was talking aobut my install
2007-12-18T19:59:00.000Z	ikonia	alexborsova	can you apply vga= options to you install
2007-12-18T19:59:00.000Z	alexborsova	ikonia	yes, it doesn't help
2007-12-18T19:59:00.000Z	ikonia	alexborsova	didn't think so, it was a long shot
2007-12-18T19:59:00.000Z	alexborsova	ikonia	I don't think the problem is with xserver
2007-12-18T19:59:00.000Z	ikonia	alexborsova	as a die issue have you tried googling your exact tablet model number and "linux"
2007-12-18T19:59:00.000Z	alexborsova	ikonia	or with gdm
2007-12-18T20:00:00.000Z	ikonia	alexborsova	just to see if anything is known running on it
2007-12-18T20:00:00.000Z	alexborsova	ikonia	yes, all that comes up is product results from google
2007-12-18T20:00:00.000Z	ikonia	alexborsova	anything related to linux
