2007-09-27T09:33:00.000Z	marduuk		why dont i get the download speeds in linux i get in windows?
2007-09-27T09:34:00.000Z	BinaryFu	marduuk	??? I get faster dls in 'nix than I ever did in Windows...site error perhaps?
2007-09-27T09:37:00.000Z	BinaryFu	marduuk	Okay, and where are you seeing slow download speeds at? What sites?
2007-09-27T09:40:00.000Z	BinaryFu	marduuk	Speeds when dling from repositories are effected by: How many people on at that time (time of day can make a major difference) and the hops for your location. When a major distro is released for example...everyone tries to get it on release day, and all you'll see on the net are complaints about how the latest version ate their operating system, locked up, etc...when in reality, it was horribly slow dl speeds because EVERYONE was
2007-09-27T09:41:00.000Z	BinaryFu	marduuk	So, if you can be a little more specific, I can help. If you're talking about repositories in Syn, my suggestion would be to go to SETTINGS - REPOSITORIES - UBUNTU SOFTWARE - DOWNLOAD FROM - Select OTHER and then pick a location NEAR YOU. This might speed things up greatly for you.

2007-09-27T09:45:00.000Z	BinaryFu	marduuk	Completely different creature. :) But...in a lot of good ways, believe me.
2007-09-27T09:46:00.000Z	BinaryFu	marduuk	Why are you going through http://gwenole.beauchesne.info for this files?
2007-09-27T09:47:00.000Z	BinaryFu	marduuk	Here's a better question - what are you trying to get to work that's not working...because I'm wondering if you can't just get these from the advanced repositories.
2007-09-27T09:48:00.000Z	BinaryFu	marduuk	Okay, just a sec bud...
2007-09-27T09:50:00.000Z	BinaryFu	marduuk	Probably, but let's see if we can't fix this once and for all... are you following this guide? http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=476924
2007-09-27T09:54:00.000Z	BinaryFu	marduuk	Yeah, the script will take care of the whole shebang for ya (hopefully)
2007-09-27T09:55:00.000Z	BinaryFu	marduuk	Use that website for questions you might have in the future...if it's out there, it's probably there...and most of the posters really know what they're talking about. :D
2007-09-27T09:56:00.000Z	BinaryFu	marduuk	It's scary? Other than that, gimmie a sec to do a check.
2007-09-27T09:58:00.000Z	BinaryFu	marduuk	"Error 17 indicates GRUB can't id the partition type. Check http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/grub.html# Troubleshooting for more info."
2007-09-27T09:58:00.000Z	BinaryFu	marduuk	Sounds like perhaps there's some issues with the duality of your bootin'.
2007-09-27T10:01:00.000Z	BinaryFu	marduuk	It might be having an issue with that...hmmm...So, when you go to boot...it gives you a grub error 17 and stops?
2007-09-27T10:02:00.000Z	BinaryFu	marduuk	Oy....can you boot into either OS or only Ubuntu?
2007-09-27T10:03:00.000Z	BinaryFu	marduuk	So...when you use the supergrub disc...can you boot either, or is one buggered?
2007-09-27T10:04:00.000Z	BinaryFu	marduuk	Okay....then there's something different between your supergrub config and your regular grub config that needs to be changed around...
2007-09-27T10:04:00.000Z	BinaryFu	marduuk	And I'm no expert on how to do that...but I know what NEEDs to be done...
2007-09-27T11:39:00.000Z	BinaryFu	marduuk	w00t! What'd ya do for the fix?
2007-09-27T11:41:00.000Z	BinaryFu	marduuk	I had no idea you didn't have the 'nix drive as master.... ><
2007-09-27T11:41:00.000Z	BinaryFu	marduuk	Glad it got fixed though! :D
