2005-07-09T12:43:00.000Z	ompaul		ahh
2005-07-09T12:44:00.000Z	alex__	ompaul	can i speak to you in private?
2005-07-09T12:44:00.000Z	ompaul	alex__	 you can
2006-03-12T15:52:00.000Z	ompaul	alex__	what version of Ubuntu?
2006-03-12T15:54:00.000Z	ompaul	alex__	what makes you think that it does not see the drives?
2006-03-12T15:55:00.000Z	alex__	ompaul	how would I know for sure?
2006-03-12T15:55:00.000Z	alex__	ompaul	I can't mount anything like /dev/sda
2006-03-12T15:56:00.000Z	ompaul	alex__	what hard drives are in the machine?
2006-03-12T15:57:00.000Z	ompaul	alex__	disconnect the ide and see how you go
2006-03-12T15:59:00.000Z	alex__	ompaul	I have my OS on the ide drive. I just want to use the sata drive for storage
2006-03-12T16:00:00.000Z	ompaul	alex__	okay so do you have it actually installed on the ide drive?
2006-03-12T16:01:00.000Z	alex__	ompaul	yes,  the OS is on that drive
2006-03-12T16:01:00.000Z	ompaul	alex__	then run this >>sudo fdisk -l<<  and see if it sees the drives, what kind of format is on those satas? are they both windows or something
2006-03-12T16:03:00.000Z	alex__	ompaul	i was mistaken, the drive is seen
2006-03-12T16:05:00.000Z	alex__	ompaul	if I want to mount the sata drive (/dev/sda) and I believe it's ntfs, can I just say "sudo mount -t ntfs /dev/sda/ /media/sata
2006-03-12T16:05:00.000Z	alex__	ompaul	is that the right filesystem type for mount, for ntfs?
2006-03-12T16:07:00.000Z	ompaul	alex__	to make it available the whole time there is a resource I will point you to, don't try writing to it, that is not supported
2006-03-12T16:07:00.000Z	ompaul	alex__	see the doc from the bot
2006-03-12T16:17:00.000Z	ompaul	alex__	when you type >>sudo fdisk -l << it tells you look at what you did already
2006-03-12T16:23:00.000Z	ompaul	alex__	fire up >>sudo fdisk /dev/sda<< and work from there
2006-03-12T16:24:00.000Z	ompaul	alex__	just think then follow the menu the onscreen is useful
2008-04-19T01:26:00.000Z	ompaul	alex__	what it is doing today and maybe a slight tweek on that
2008-04-19T01:27:00.000Z	ompaul	alex__	you need to visit #ubuntu+1 for more detail
2008-04-19T01:27:00.000Z	alex__	ompaul	thanks!
