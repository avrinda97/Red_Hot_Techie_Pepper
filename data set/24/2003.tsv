2012-05-24T15:01:00.000Z	SolarisBoy		uhhh
2012-05-24T15:02:00.000Z	SolarisBoy		waiting for network means you have or may have a slow network
2012-05-24T15:02:00.000Z	SolarisBoy		rather than bandwidth consumption - maybe your getting slow dhcp assignment or something?
2012-05-24T15:02:00.000Z	stueng	SolarisBoy	I dont want network, I commented out everything in interfaces I want to contorl the network after I boot
2012-05-24T15:02:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	stueng	leave lo up dude..
2012-05-24T15:03:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	stueng	then once you do that ok - sure disable the interfaces.. it really depends _where_ they are managed at
2012-05-24T15:03:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	stueng	network manager maybe?
2012-05-24T15:04:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	stueng	anyway once you get a clean boot - restart network manually and see if it spits a clue on console or logs
2012-05-24T15:04:00.000Z	stueng	SolarisBoy	the box is portable, in different locations it will connect oto different networks.  I want to manage the networks from inside XBMC with the nm-manager plugin
2012-05-24T15:05:00.000Z	stueng	SolarisBoy	network manager works independantly of interfaces? is there a file I can edit to look at what its trying to do?
2012-05-24T15:06:00.000Z	stueng	SolarisBoy	right, and how would I configure NM? from the terminal? which file(s)?
2012-05-24T15:06:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	stueng	nothing says you don't have some other not so common network utility running - but technically its not that fuzzy check network manager - check interfaces
2012-05-24T15:06:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	stueng	either or
2012-05-24T15:07:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	stueng	most users will default to the applet configuration - but i think you can use the command line the sme
2012-05-24T15:07:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	stueng	^^
2012-05-24T15:07:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	stueng	nm-tool i think will atleast print the configs for you
2012-05-24T15:08:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	stueng	rather the interfaces its managing - and their status
2012-05-24T15:08:00.000Z	stueng	SolarisBoy	yeah it spits out a list of SSIDs in range and the status of  eth0
2012-05-24T15:09:00.000Z	stueng	SolarisBoy	for example, in the gui, you can tick a box tha t says  "connect automatically"
2012-05-24T15:10:00.000Z	stueng	SolarisBoy	so what I am looking for is the text based equivilant to unticking that box I guess
2012-05-24T15:10:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	stueng	you need to man the command
2012-05-24T15:10:00.000Z	stueng	SolarisBoy	its about 3 lines long, the man
2012-05-24T15:11:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	stueng	man/research - i just mentioned im not as fmailiar nm - not used to using it - i set up my interfaces manually - i hate managers
2012-05-24T15:12:00.000Z	stueng	SolarisBoy	I am fine using nm to join/leave networks etc, to control the connections, what I cant find is where it stores its config .... but ill have a google around to see if I can find it
