2006-05-28T10:39:00.000Z	ompaul	Bonaldo2000	what was the question again?
2006-05-28T10:39:00.000Z	Bonaldo2000	ompaul	my question is here: http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=182784
2006-05-28T10:40:00.000Z	Bonaldo2000	ompaul	I am quite sure it is a simple thing I am doing wrong, since I am pretty much a n00b
2006-05-28T10:40:00.000Z	Bonaldo2000	ompaul	I simply dont really know the right way to connect to a network printer from ubuntu
2006-05-28T10:43:00.000Z	ompaul	Bonaldo2000	try system administration printing, then choose new printer and try network printer see what you can get out of that
2006-05-28T10:44:00.000Z	Bonaldo2000	ompaul	but thats what I have done! :-) I have it set up to IPP on the adress that my printer specifies! But nothing happens when I try to print...I can ping it over the network so I have contact...
2006-05-28T10:45:00.000Z	ompaul	Bonaldo2000	can you telnet to the printer?
2006-05-28T10:45:00.000Z	ompaul	Bonaldo2000	issue the command "telnet IP-For-Printer" and see if you can access it
2006-05-28T10:45:00.000Z	Bonaldo2000	ompaul	ok will try, to secs
2006-05-28T10:46:00.000Z	Bonaldo2000	ompaul	yes I can...however it then asks me for login information and I dont know what to use....
2006-05-28T10:46:00.000Z	ompaul	Bonaldo2000	try root and enter
2006-05-28T10:47:00.000Z	ompaul	Bonaldo2000	or point a web browser at the printer also
2006-05-28T10:47:00.000Z	Bonaldo2000	ompaul	I have already tried pointing my browser at it...and it works...I get a fine gui where I can see different options!
2006-05-28T10:48:00.000Z	Bonaldo2000	ompaul	it was from here that I saw what IPP adress to use...
2006-05-28T10:48:00.000Z	ompaul	Bonaldo2000	so can you take a screen shot of that screen and paste it in paste.ubuntu-nl.org
2006-05-28T10:49:00.000Z	Bonaldo2000	ompaul	what screen...just the first one that shows when I log on to the printer via the web-browser?
2006-05-28T10:50:00.000Z	ompaul	Bonaldo2000	one that offers some configuration options
2006-05-28T10:51:00.000Z	Bonaldo2000	ompaul	ok..
2006-05-28T10:56:00.000Z	Bonaldo2000	ompaul	here it is: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14780
2006-05-28T10:57:00.000Z	ompaul	Bonaldo2000	what are the options under tcp/ip?
2006-05-28T10:58:00.000Z	Bonaldo2000	ompaul	I can change its IP-adress in there...
2006-05-28T10:58:00.000Z	ompaul	Bonaldo2000	no other issues
2006-05-28T10:59:00.000Z	Bonaldo2000	ompaul	no other issues..what do you mean?
