2008-11-13T15:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ditch64	you need to boot to live cd to reinstall grub properly
2008-11-13T15:33:00.000Z	ditch64	ActionParsnip	ok, im on live CD now when i type sudo grub, it doesnt probe for devices, ill put in setup (hd0) and it says not a valid device, but i know for a face it is
2008-11-13T15:33:00.000Z	ditch64	ActionParsnip	fact*
2008-11-13T15:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ditch64	read the guide, its all there
2008-11-13T15:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ditch64	try sudo fdisk -l to see partitions / disks
2008-11-13T15:35:00.000Z	ditch64	ActionParsnip	Error 17: Cannot mount selected partition
2008-11-13T15:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ditch64	then you need to verify you are using the correct partition
2008-11-13T15:37:00.000Z	ditch64	ActionParsnip	my boot partition is on partition 1
2008-11-13T15:37:00.000Z	ditch64	ActionParsnip	grub is loaded to hd0,1
2008-11-13T15:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ditch64	well you need to verify stuff, if its all correct it'd boot
2008-11-13T15:39:00.000Z	ditch64	ActionParsnip	ahh, my boot is set to sda3, i forgot the command to change it to sda1
2008-11-13T15:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ditch64	see
2008-11-13T15:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ditch64	check stuff over if its no good ;)
2008-11-13T15:40:00.000Z	ditch64	ActionParsnip	lol, well hey, i JUST did this on my buddys computer and it worked exactly how im doing it tho
2008-11-13T15:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ditch64	different system, dude
2008-11-13T15:40:00.000Z	ditch64	ActionParsnip	whats the command to change the boot partition
2008-11-13T15:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ditch64	unless his partitions are identical to yours
2008-11-13T15:40:00.000Z	ditch64	ActionParsnip	ya they are, we installed them next to each other
2008-11-13T15:40:00.000Z	ditch64	ActionParsnip	thx
2008-11-13T15:42:00.000Z	ditch64	ActionParsnip	another problem, i booted the computer and got to grub and said i cannot mount the selected partition
2008-11-13T15:42:00.000Z	ditch64	ActionParsnip	might this be the reason
2008-11-13T15:45:00.000Z	ditch64	ActionParsnip	would this problem that i have be the reason that it couldnt mount the selected kernal or w/e when i got to grub?
