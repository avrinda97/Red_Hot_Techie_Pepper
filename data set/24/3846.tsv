2009-11-12T19:03:00.000Z	alberto	bazhang	What should I do?
2009-11-12T19:05:00.000Z	bazhang	alberto	open a terminal and type alsamixer and see that nothing is muted
2009-11-12T19:06:00.000Z	bazhang	alberto	you can switch between them with the arrows keys.
2009-11-12T19:08:00.000Z	bazhang	alberto	what did you change
2009-11-12T19:08:00.000Z	alberto	bazhang	Nothing really
2009-11-12T19:08:00.000Z	alberto	bazhang	Master is turned up
2009-11-12T19:09:00.000Z	alberto	bazhang	As well as Center
2009-11-12T19:09:00.000Z	bazhang	alberto	if the sounds is turned to the max (ie PCM) it may have the effect of no sound; best to leave at around 80-85 for that
2009-11-12T19:09:00.000Z	alberto	bazhang	Ok, I'll try
2009-11-12T19:10:00.000Z	alberto	bazhang	It doesn't work
2009-11-12T19:10:00.000Z	bazhang	alberto	what does not work
2009-11-12T19:11:00.000Z	bazhang	alberto	so only at max it works?
2009-11-12T19:11:00.000Z	alberto	bazhang	No, there's no sound. No matter how I set the volumes.
2009-11-12T19:12:00.000Z	alberto	bazhang	Very strange, isn't it?
2009-11-12T19:12:00.000Z	alberto	bazhang	Yesterday sound worked perfectly well.
2009-11-12T19:16:00.000Z	alberto	bazhang	Any ideas?
2009-11-12T19:17:00.000Z	bazhang	alberto	are you using wine? playing youtube while also using and mp3 player?
2009-11-12T19:17:00.000Z	alberto	bazhang	No, I've just opened XChat
2009-11-12T19:19:00.000Z	alberto	bazhang	Thanks very much
2009-11-12T19:22:00.000Z	alberto	bazhang	Terminal says there's no sound group!
2009-11-12T19:24:00.000Z	alberto	bazhang	How could that happened?
2009-11-12T19:24:00.000Z	alberto	bazhang	I didn't erase the sound group
2009-11-12T19:36:00.000Z	alberto	bazhang	Problem solved, thank you very much. There were some volumes turned completely down.
