2009-01-09T10:16:00.000Z	jp_sf	shoto1699	what gives you a nidiswrapper -l ?
2009-01-09T10:18:00.000Z	shoto1699	jp_sf	wut do u mean?
2009-01-09T10:18:00.000Z	jp_sf	shoto1699	could open a terminal prompt and type: nidiswrapper -l
2009-01-09T10:18:00.000Z	jp_sf	shoto1699	could open a terminal prompt and type: ndiswrapper -l
2009-01-09T10:19:00.000Z	shoto1699	jp_sf	not on ubuntu right now
2009-01-09T10:19:00.000Z	jp_sf	shoto1699	sorry for the typo
2009-01-09T10:19:00.000Z	shoto1699	jp_sf	well when i tried it, it did not do anything
2009-01-09T10:19:00.000Z	jp_sf	shoto1699	ok so when you are back to make sure that ndiswrapper loaded correctly the .inf you type : ndiswrapper -l and you should get back something like device blablabla present
2009-01-09T10:20:00.000Z	shoto1699	jp_sf	i tried to load it but it did not work
2009-01-09T10:21:00.000Z	shoto1699	jp_sf	i shall go on ubuntu to try once more
2009-01-09T10:21:00.000Z	shoto1699	jp_sf	brb
2009-01-09T10:22:00.000Z	jp_sf	shoto1699	what do you mean it didn't work ? if you could paste the output of the ndiswrapper that would be great the loading of the .inf is just the first step after you have to configure it, but you have to make sure that the correct .inf is loaded
2009-01-09T10:22:00.000Z	shoto1699	jp_sf	i tried to load the .inf's but it did not work
2009-01-09T10:23:00.000Z	jp_sf	shoto1699	you are in dual boot I guess so what you need to ensure is you have the correct .inf that you can find on the CDRom then you issue a command sudo ndiswrapper - i .inf (is that not working ?)
2009-01-09T10:24:00.000Z	shoto1699	jp_sf	that does not work
2009-01-09T10:24:00.000Z	jp_sf	shoto1699	you have an error message or something ?
2009-01-09T10:28:00.000Z	shoto1699	jp_sf	yes i get an error message
2009-01-09T10:29:00.000Z	jp_sf	shoto1699	that might be helpful to get the error message
2009-01-09T10:30:00.000Z	shoto1699	jp_sf	i shall go on ubuntu to get the error msg brb
