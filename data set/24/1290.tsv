2010-04-04T23:15:00.000Z	ForestBear		hey guys my mic isn't recording for some reason
2010-04-04T23:16:00.000Z	lallenlowe	ForestBear	did you check the imput settings in System > preferences > sound?
2010-04-04T23:16:00.000Z	lallenlowe		input*
2010-04-04T23:16:00.000Z	ForestBear	lallenlowe	actually I removed pulseaudio because it's kind of screwed up on my system
2010-04-04T23:17:00.000Z	lallenlowe	ForestBear	oh, that's too bad, I love pulse
2010-04-04T23:17:00.000Z	lallenlowe	ForestBear	it finally made this kind of thing easy
2010-04-04T23:17:00.000Z	lallenlowe	ForestBear	are you on Karmic?
2010-04-04T23:17:00.000Z	ForestBear	lallenlowe	it always makes a crackling sound and causes lag
2010-04-04T23:17:00.000Z	ForestBear	lallenlowe	yes I am
2010-04-04T23:18:00.000Z	lallenlowe	ForestBear	just out of curiosity, have you tried Lucid at all?
2010-04-04T23:18:00.000Z	ForestBear	lallenlowe	no I haven't, does it finally not rely on pulse?
2010-04-04T23:19:00.000Z	lallenlowe	ForestBear	are you new to ubuntu? Pulse is the NEW thing, not the old
2010-04-04T23:19:00.000Z	lallenlowe	ForestBear	I'm just saying it's possible that pulse will work better for you in lucid
2010-04-04T23:19:00.000Z	ForestBear	lallenlowe	well I liked pulse before it became mandatory in Karmic
2010-04-04T23:19:00.000Z	ForestBear		(integrated with the sound prefs, etc)
2010-04-04T23:20:00.000Z	ForestBear	lallenlowe	ok i'll go do some reading into that
2010-04-04T23:20:00.000Z	lallenlowe	ForestBear	actually, I was just curious if it worked better
2010-04-04T23:21:00.000Z	ForestBear	lallenlowe	oh so at my own risk?
2010-04-04T23:21:00.000Z	lallenlowe	ForestBear	use alsa-mixer and make sure your mic is turned up and not muted, and chosen as the uinput
2010-04-04T23:22:00.000Z	lallenlowe	ForestBear	did you see my post about alsamixer?
2010-04-04T23:23:00.000Z	ForestBear	lallenlowe	yes I did, I'm trying to toggle settings and combinations to see what works or not
2010-04-04T23:23:00.000Z	lallenlowe	ForestBear	awesoem
2010-04-04T23:24:00.000Z	ForestBear	lallenlowe	what is the IEC958?
2010-04-04T23:30:00.000Z	ForestBear	lallenlowe	it's not working
