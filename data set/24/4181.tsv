2007-06-16T09:10:00.000Z	BrMiHi08		chaosmystic- it is for business, you take the pocket PC out into the field and then you get readings off of air vents for RPM CFM and stuff, then you take it back and sync it
2007-06-16T09:10:00.000Z	BrMiHi08		chaosmystic- it is for HVAC stuff if you know what that is
2007-06-16T09:11:00.000Z	BrMiHi08		chaosmystic- the server would be at the office and then  when the pocket pc goes to job sites to get the data and then syncs it
2007-06-16T09:11:00.000Z	BrMiHi08		regeya- he is helping me
2007-06-16T09:12:00.000Z	holymoly	BrMiHi08	your soulution is fairly specific
2007-06-16T09:12:00.000Z	holymoly	BrMiHi08	nothing generic exists like that really
2007-06-16T09:12:00.000Z	holymoly	BrMiHi08	the problem is the client / server architecterue on a multi platform and multi device basis
2007-06-16T09:15:00.000Z	holymoly	BrMiHi08	but regardless you are still a) asking in the wrong channel and really b) approaching the problem solving for this the wrong way
2007-06-16T09:15:00.000Z	holymoly	BrMiHi08	what specifically datawise are you needing such replication capabilities?
2007-06-16T09:16:00.000Z	holymoly	BrMiHi08	that is the first place you should be lookiing at actually
2007-06-16T09:17:00.000Z	holymoly	BrMiHi08	its also fantastically easy to create your own database applications although there is a bit of a learning curve or course
2007-06-16T09:18:00.000Z	holymoly	BrMiHi08	look seriously into lotus notes, there is nothing out there that even comes close to that
2007-06-16T09:18:00.000Z	holymoly	BrMiHi08	please be aware of one thing about lotus notes:
2007-06-16T09:18:00.000Z	holymoly	BrMiHi08	in particular windows users that ONLY know ms outlook (notes also does email btw all in one)
2007-06-16T09:19:00.000Z	holymoly	BrMiHi08	my STRONG advice is to ignore windows users (as always) and dig in and find out for your self
2007-06-16T09:20:00.000Z	holymoly	BrMiHi08	100% we use it
2007-06-16T09:20:00.000Z	holymoly	BrMiHi08	notes comes in a client/ server architecture of course, server is EXTREMELY powerfull
2007-06-16T09:21:00.000Z	holymoly	BrMiHi08	the are comming out with a cross platform notes client tho
2007-06-16T09:21:00.000Z	holymoly	BrMiHi08	so you will be able to run it on linux natively at some poitn in time when you get a umpc
2007-06-16T09:22:00.000Z	holymoly	BrMiHi08	for now you can run the windows client in crossover office, works great, its what we do
2007-06-16T09:22:00.000Z	holymoly	BrMiHi08	nope
2007-06-16T09:22:00.000Z	holymoly	BrMiHi08	those sorts of devices are just undepowered
2007-06-16T09:22:00.000Z	holymoly	BrMiHi08	you can't be looking for anything that has less than a 1ghz cpu under the hood
2007-06-16T09:24:00.000Z	holymoly	BrMiHi08	i thin that right there will blow 6 month off your life in terms of research, so have fun :)
