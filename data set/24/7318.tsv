2005-03-11T06:14:00.000Z	b		or, use nautilus, type cntl "l"  then applications:/// in command line
2005-03-11T06:14:00.000Z	b		see? I know a few things  lol
2005-03-11T06:15:00.000Z	b		I like the nautilus way better, easy
2005-03-11T06:15:00.000Z	b		puts it in your menu
2005-03-11T06:15:00.000Z	b		did I help you Shade?
2005-03-11T06:16:00.000Z	b		ok, is he using something else?
2005-03-11T06:16:00.000Z	b		I thought Warty was the most recent Ubuntu
2005-03-11T06:17:00.000Z	b		what is most recent unstable?
2005-03-11T06:17:00.000Z	b		is it available by iso image?
2005-03-11T06:19:00.000Z	apokryphos	b	yes
2005-03-11T06:20:00.000Z	apokryphos	b	with distributions on Linux? I've never come across a newest distribution that hasn't been better than the older one.
2005-03-11T06:21:00.000Z	apokryphos	b	by all means, please check the site to find out whether it's suitable for you then
2005-03-11T06:35:00.000Z	apokryphos	b	I do ;-)
2005-03-11T06:40:00.000Z	apokryphos	b	no it doesn't; synaptic is only the GUI front-end. Any retrieving/dependency problems in synaptic are problems in apt
2005-03-11T06:44:00.000Z	apokryphos	b	hahaha
2005-03-11T06:46:00.000Z	apokryphos	b	I've asked. The only reason they're suggesting for not using synaptic is that "it can crash", which seems like a pretty bad reason, considering (i) my synaptic doesn't crash, (ii) console can crash too.
2005-03-11T06:47:00.000Z	apokryphos	b	anyhow, if you wanted to stop this synaptic getting a life of its own (with the uncommenting and whatnot), you could always just make sure that they never existed at all in the sources.list, couldn't you?
2005-03-11T06:49:00.000Z	apokryphos	b	because, (i) I haven't had these "problems", (ii) GUI provides a few more features that are more easily accessible. I don't want new users to necessarily dive straight into apt.
2005-03-11T07:09:00.000Z	apokryphos	b	they're working on it: kubuntu
2005-03-11T07:11:00.000Z	apokryphos	b	You're wrong, friend.
2005-03-11T07:11:00.000Z	apokryphos	b	I tried, it worked fine, but it was an older kde version.
2005-03-11T07:12:00.000Z	apokryphos	b	http://www.ubuntulinux.org/support/documentation/faq/kde/view?searchterm=kde here's just one.
2005-03-11T07:14:00.000Z	apokryphos	b	Yes, you are
