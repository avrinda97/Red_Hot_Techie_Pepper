2008-09-11T16:19:00.000Z	rajec		Guys it is possible for workspace to have its own files? I would like to be able to divide files as I am now able windows. You know what I mean?
2008-09-11T16:20:00.000Z	waan	rajec	not quite, what do you mean?
2008-09-11T16:20:00.000Z	rajec	waan	now you can have different windows on each workspace right?
2008-09-11T16:20:00.000Z	waan	rajec	yep i'm using 3 now
2008-09-11T16:23:00.000Z	waan	rajec	what you're talking about doesn't really make sense ??
2008-09-11T16:23:00.000Z	rajec	waan	ActionParsnip understands it
2008-09-11T16:23:00.000Z	waan	rajec	sorry i'm not sure
2008-09-11T16:24:00.000Z	waan	rajec	it sounds like you want a different filesystem for each workspace, which is weird
2008-09-11T16:24:00.000Z	rajec	waan	I want to have different files on each workspace
2008-09-11T16:25:00.000Z	waan	rajec	like, open a different folder on each workspace?
2008-09-11T16:25:00.000Z	rajec	waan	have different files on different workspace. For example. When I look on first workspace there will be media files, on second some other files..
2008-09-11T16:26:00.000Z	waan	rajec	can't you store the files in seperate folders, and have each folder for each window?
2008-09-11T16:29:00.000Z	rajec	waan	folder are shared too so its same
2008-09-11T16:29:00.000Z	waan	rajec	do you want to restrict access to files from one workspace, or just list certail files?
2008-09-11T16:30:00.000Z	rajec	waan	I think we are thinking about something else so nevermind ;)
2008-09-11T16:30:00.000Z	waan	rajec	if you just mean different shortcuts for different workspaces??
2008-09-11T16:30:00.000Z	rajec	waan	I am getting confused ;)
2008-09-11T16:31:00.000Z	rajec	waan	I want to have different files on each workspace.
2008-09-11T16:31:00.000Z	waan	rajec	how many workspaces do you have?
2008-09-11T16:33:00.000Z	waan	rajec	maybe if you rephrase the question a bit?
2008-09-11T16:34:00.000Z	waan	rajec	what do you use to view you "files"
2008-09-11T16:34:00.000Z	rajec	waan	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_file
2008-09-11T16:36:00.000Z	waan	rajec	ok then what it sounds like is.. you want different parts of your filesystem available for seperate workspaces?
2008-09-11T16:45:00.000Z	waan	rajec	did you figure it out yet?
