2011-10-21T08:33:00.000Z	blah		i deleted my home folder ~/ part-accidentally (ubuntu is to blame too). where do i get a copy of the default home folder files ?   /etc/skel has only couple .bash config files
2011-10-21T08:35:00.000Z	blah		i had a sub directory named '~' in my home directory: ~/stuff/~ . i was in stuff and did rm -rf ~/ hoping to remove stuff/~/ , but iot removed home directory instead.
2011-10-21T08:36:00.000Z	blah		well. i blame linux too.. the intuitive / expected command does something totally unexpected
2011-10-21T08:37:00.000Z	blah		what ? the linux command for deleting a sub directory is rm -r dirname/
2011-10-21T08:37:00.000Z	blah		atleast that's how it works for most of the directories..
2011-10-21T08:38:00.000Z	blah		that's exactly what i typed
2011-10-21T08:38:00.000Z	blah		rm -r ~/
2011-10-21T08:38:00.000Z	pangolin	blah	Do not type that command in here again or I will ban you.
2011-10-21T08:39:00.000Z	blah		well i didn't create it. i was installing some software, and it created it automatically
2011-10-21T08:39:00.000Z	blah		hadoop
2011-10-21T08:41:00.000Z	blah	yagoo	it's not a question of figuring out some extra escape variable syntax.. if linux has to gain popularity, it should let users shoot themselves in the foot so easily.. i mean is it that hard to add some extra precautions.. if the person who wrote rm could add an -i option, they might as well add a 'don't delete home directory ~, if there is a sub directory ~' option
2011-10-21T08:41:00.000Z	blah		*should not
2011-10-21T08:43:00.000Z	blah		of course it is the user error, why are u stating the obvious? all i'm saying is that linux shouldn't let them make the errors so easily
2011-10-21T08:43:00.000Z	blah		like i said before, adding the -i only makes u blind to it after a while..
2011-10-21T08:44:00.000Z	blah		dude... i know how to do it now
2011-10-21T08:44:00.000Z	blah		my only rant is why the default behaviour of rm is to 'oh let me remove the parent directory ~ instead of the sub directory ~'
2011-10-21T08:46:00.000Z	blah		"not that I believe that hadoop makes such a poorly named folder" - who in these parts believes anything they don't see for themselves ..
2011-10-21T08:47:00.000Z	blah		fine.. like i said, do it urself and then believe
2011-10-21T08:47:00.000Z	blah		anyways, i came here for a backup of the default home folder files.. can i find it on the live CD
2011-10-21T08:49:00.000Z	blah		i woudn't blame linux if the rm command had behaved intuitively (meaning ' rm should look to delete sub-directories before gunning for parent directories, even if it be '~')
2011-10-21T08:49:00.000Z	pangolin		!ot | blah
2011-10-21T08:50:00.000Z	blah		how is the shell not linux ?
2011-10-21T08:50:00.000Z	blah		anyways, i'm just ranting here..
2011-10-21T08:50:00.000Z	pangolin	blah	Please stop the ranting.
