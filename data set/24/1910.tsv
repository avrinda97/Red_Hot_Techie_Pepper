2009-11-02T01:34:00.000Z	Manifest		Why is this: http://imgcapture.info/Nov09/ewezHBGD.png happening to me?
2009-11-02T01:35:00.000Z	Manifest		Can anyone help me? Just switched to 9.10, REALLY need help
2009-11-02T01:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Manifest	does it happen for all users?
2009-11-02T01:35:00.000Z	Manifest	ActionParsnip	Can't test, I'm the only user
2009-11-02T01:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Manifest	make a new user....
2009-11-02T01:36:00.000Z	Manifest	ActionParsnip	Yeah, next problem is: When I open firefox my comp. freezes
2009-11-02T01:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Manifest	have you tried renaming ~/.mozilla
2009-11-02T01:36:00.000Z	Manifest	ActionParsnip	No, I have not
2009-11-02T01:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Manifest	worth a try
2009-11-02T01:36:00.000Z	Manifest	ActionParsnip	Where's that at? and what do I rename it to?
2009-11-02T01:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Manifest	you'll get a fresh profile
2009-11-02T01:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Manifest	~/.mozilla is the location, just give it a different name
2009-11-02T01:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Manifest	~ is your home folder
2009-11-02T01:37:00.000Z	Manifest	ActionParsnip	Ok
2009-11-02T01:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Manifest	once renamed and you run firefox, you will get a vanilla profile, see if it works with taht
2009-11-02T01:38:00.000Z	Manifest	ActionParsnip	Ok
2009-11-02T01:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Manifest	if it does, your profile is bad
2009-11-02T01:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Manifest	if it works ok you have 2 choices, rename back and troubleshoot (hard) or rebuild a fresh profile (easy)
2009-11-19T17:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Manifest	remove '/public.html'    from the address, you ftp to servers not web pages
2009-11-19T17:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Manifest	try:     ftp://cpcheati@cpcheating.com
2009-11-19T17:43:00.000Z	Manifest	ActionParsnip	Public HTML is not in the address
2009-11-19T17:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Manifest	strange, ok does the file ~/firefox   exist?
2009-11-19T17:44:00.000Z	Manifest	ActionParsnip	Yes.
2009-11-19T17:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Manifest	can you connect with proper ftp clients?
