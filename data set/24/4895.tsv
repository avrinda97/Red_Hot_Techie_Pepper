2006-12-17T09:57:00.000Z	ifti		I'm in a bit of jam
2006-12-17T09:58:00.000Z	ifti		I just installed ubuntu 6.06 on my IBM T30, and in the process of trying to get my wireless card to work I somehow screwed up my network settings
2006-12-17T09:58:00.000Z	ifti		with the effect that I can't connect even through the built in NIC
2006-12-17T10:00:00.000Z	ifti		I've been typing /etc/init.d/networking restart in the terminal
2006-12-17T10:00:00.000Z	ifti		and getting ifdown: failed to open statefile /var/run/network/ifstate:permision denied
2006-12-17T10:01:00.000Z	ifti		oh sorry
2006-12-17T10:01:00.000Z	ifti		I have been sudo ing it
2006-12-17T10:01:00.000Z	ifti		I just forgot to type that in the message
2006-12-17T10:02:00.000Z	ifti		so I still can't get connected to my network
2006-12-17T10:02:00.000Z	ifti		it was working fine when I first installed
2006-12-17T10:02:00.000Z	frogzoo	ifti	sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart
2006-12-17T10:02:00.000Z	ifti	frogzoo	I've been doing that
2006-12-17T10:03:00.000Z	ifti		and it says OK
2006-12-17T10:03:00.000Z	ifti		but still can't connect
2006-12-17T10:03:00.000Z	ifti		Wastrel: what do I put in it?
2006-12-17T10:03:00.000Z	ifti		is there some default settings for it
2006-12-17T10:04:00.000Z	ifti		eth0
2006-12-17T10:04:00.000Z	ifti		it was working fine
2006-12-17T10:04:00.000Z	ifti		until I tried to get my Wifi card to work
2006-12-17T10:05:00.000Z	ifti		i think I screwed something up in the process
2006-12-17T10:05:00.000Z	ifti		I have a DHCP server
2006-12-17T10:05:00.000Z	ifti		I can just delete the whole file?
2006-12-17T10:06:00.000Z	ifti		will try
2006-12-17T10:06:00.000Z	frogzoo	ifti	ls /var/run/network/
