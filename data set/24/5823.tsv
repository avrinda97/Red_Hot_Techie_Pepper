2006-04-20T14:32:00.000Z	latrek		hi there
2006-04-20T14:33:00.000Z	latrek		I just installed ubuntu
2006-04-20T14:33:00.000Z	latrek		for the first time
2006-04-20T14:33:00.000Z	latrek		and x server just crashed on me
2006-04-20T14:33:00.000Z	latrek		not sure what to do
2006-04-20T14:33:00.000Z	latrek		what do you think I should do?
2006-04-20T14:34:00.000Z	mwe	latrek	when did it crash?
2006-04-20T14:34:00.000Z	mwe	latrek	I mean when you tried starting it or what?
2006-04-20T14:34:00.000Z	mwe	latrek	oh. it worked before that?
2006-04-20T14:35:00.000Z	mwe	latrek	well can you log in at the command line?
2006-04-20T14:36:00.000Z	mwe	latrek	can you log in at the command line? I guess so
2006-04-20T14:38:00.000Z	mwe	latrek	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg might at least get it to run
2006-04-20T14:49:00.000Z	mwe	latrek	sudo /etc/init.d/gdm start or startx
2006-04-20T15:19:00.000Z	mwe	latrek	and sudo /etc/init.d/gdm start doesn't work?
2006-04-20T15:19:00.000Z	mwe	latrek	sudo /etc/init.d/gdm start doesn't work?
2006-04-20T15:20:00.000Z	mwe	latrek	try sudo /etc/init.d/gdm start
2006-04-20T15:20:00.000Z	mwe	latrek	or pastebin.com the eroor
2006-04-20T15:22:00.000Z	latrek	mwe	I did /etc/init.d/gdm start but it failed
2006-04-20T15:23:00.000Z	mwe	latrek	what error?
2006-04-20T15:24:00.000Z	mwe	latrek	look at /var/log/Xorg.0.log
2006-04-20T15:24:00.000Z	mwe	latrek	grep EE /var/log/Xorg.0.log
2006-04-20T15:25:00.000Z	mwe	latrek	you probably didn't answer the questions correctly
2006-04-20T15:25:00.000Z	latrek	mwe	is it because I'm using a kvm switch?
2006-04-20T15:25:00.000Z	mwe	latrek	I don't know. I don't know much about kvm
