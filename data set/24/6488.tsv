2005-10-08T05:52:00.000Z	jimmyyyyyyyy	nalioth	and QMario: I'd love to see it kill a box!
2005-10-08T05:52:00.000Z	nalioth	jimmyyyyyyyy	then use it exclusively for all your answers
2005-10-08T05:52:00.000Z	jimmyyyyyyyy	nalioth	and QMario: All i use it for is apt repos
2005-10-08T05:52:00.000Z	nalioth	jimmyyyyyyyy	then you wont wait long
2005-10-08T05:53:00.000Z	jimmyyyyyyyy	nalioth	and QMario: what questions in there will kill your box, other then the "HOWTO rm -r /*"
2005-10-08T05:53:00.000Z	nalioth	jimmyyyyyyyy	the apt resources will bring your box to a grinding halt
2005-10-08T05:54:00.000Z	nalioth	jimmyyyyyyyy	those sources are the ones you should have
2005-10-08T05:54:00.000Z	nalioth	jimmyyyyyyyy	backports are official now. mirrormax should not be used
2005-10-08T05:55:00.000Z	jimmyyyyyyyy	nalioth	thanks for telling me that i was noticing mirrormax was down a lot
2005-10-08T05:55:00.000Z	nalioth	jimmyyyyyyyy	there are other things there that are not desirable
2005-10-08T05:55:00.000Z	jimmyyyyyyyy	nalioth	example...?
2005-10-08T05:55:00.000Z	nalioth	jimmyyyyyyyy	make your sources official and hope it's not too late
2005-10-08T05:57:00.000Z	jimmyyyyyyyy	nalioth	I don't care if my repo's are official, as long as they have the packages I want (even if they're trojan ridden :D)
2005-10-08T05:58:00.000Z	nalioth	jimmyyyyyyyy	trojans are not the problem. you will soon be against an upgrade wall, and won't be able to return.  reinstallation will have to take place
2005-10-08T05:59:00.000Z	jimmyyyyyyyy	nalioth	I was just kidding I was using trojan ridden as an example
2005-10-08T05:59:00.000Z	jimmyyyyyyyy	nalioth	I've slammed the upgrade wall a few times not
2005-10-08T05:59:00.000Z	jimmyyyyyyyy	nalioth	now
2005-10-08T06:00:00.000Z	jimmyyyyyyyy	nalioth	A point where you can't upgrade because all your packages are different confilicting version
2005-10-08T06:01:00.000Z	jimmyyyyyyyy	nalioth	where's the list of official repos?
2005-10-08T06:02:00.000Z	nalioth	jimmyyyyyyyy	ubotu sent you a PM
2005-10-08T06:02:00.000Z	jimmyyyyyyyy	nalioth	I told him STFU :D
2005-10-08T06:04:00.000Z	nalioth	jimmyyyyyyyy	yes, be civil please. the bot is a very good info source
2005-10-08T06:05:00.000Z	nalioth	jimmyyyyyyyy	weren't you shown the door earlier for something?
