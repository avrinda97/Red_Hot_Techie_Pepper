2012-08-14T23:44:00.000Z	Alex_____		I am in need of some help concerning my installation
2012-08-14T23:46:00.000Z	Alex_____		okay well at first I was trying to perform an installation via USB but then after having used universal USB and all I booted it up and while it is booting up with the splash it just crashes and all i see is black and white horizontal lines followed by a blank screen (this happened a few more times then i gave up). I decided the use the windows installer and i deleted my older boot and used wubi who also received some error at the 
2012-08-14T23:47:00.000Z	Alex_____		everything and retried wubi but it now gives me an error that it cant be opened
2012-08-14T23:49:00.000Z	Alex_____		its ubuntu 12.04
2012-08-14T23:50:00.000Z	Alex_____		ur a bot? how?
2012-08-14T23:50:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	Alex_____	are you getting the try ubuntu and other options like a disc and or memory check gui, and if so did you tick nomodeset?
2012-08-14T23:51:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	Alex_____	so the f6 at that gui does nothing?
2012-08-14T23:53:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	Alex_____	one of them is nomodeset I forget but it may be the space key to tick the link tells you that the bot gave.
2012-08-14T23:55:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	Alex_____	your answers are not really making sense read carefully and answer as such, For example I asked if nothing happened with the f6 you said yes then said it had 4 or 5 options, the key here is comunication.
2012-08-14T23:57:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	Alex_____	no biggie did you lok at the nomodeset link the bot gave?
2012-08-14T23:57:00.000Z	Alex_____	wilee-nilee	i did but it said that it applies to ubuntu 10.04 and 10.10
2012-08-14T23:58:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	Alex_____	it applies to all releases

2012-08-15T00:06:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	Alex_____	all you need to do is follow the directions at the gui hit f6 toggle to the nomodeset use the space to tick or hit enter and boot in.
2012-08-15T00:07:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	Alex_____	whether it looks exactly doe not matter the terms shown are the same, ab\nd the f6 menu as well.

2012-08-15T00:08:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	Alex_____	have you done a md5sum check on the disc?
2012-08-15T00:10:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	Alex_____	if you are still trying the wubi it will not look the same, I assume you were back with the usb
