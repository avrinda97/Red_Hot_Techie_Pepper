2007-03-01T14:51:00.000Z	colbert		Please someone help, what is the command in terminal to create this file: "etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.d/mouse
2007-03-01T14:52:00.000Z	Slart	colbert	what's supposed to be in that file? if it's a text file then ""editor /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.d/mouse" will work.. you might have to put a sudo in front of it
2007-03-01T14:53:00.000Z	colbert	Slart	http://silentbits.com/2005/01/30/microsoft-intellimouse-explorer-in-linux/      at the top is what I am trying to do
2007-03-01T14:54:00.000Z	Slart	colbert	looking at the website.. be back
2007-03-01T14:55:00.000Z	Slart	colbert	how do you start gedit? you might want to try "gksudo gedit" using the console instead
2007-03-01T14:56:00.000Z	colbert	Slart	I tried that, same error
2007-03-01T14:56:00.000Z	colbert	Slart	I am getting this when I do sudo gedit: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/8121/
2007-03-01T14:57:00.000Z	Slart	colbert	are all the directories there? that walk through is almost 2 years old.. things might have changed.... have you tried just editing the stuff in xorg.conf? that worked for my logitech mouse
2007-03-01T14:58:00.000Z	Slart	colbert	oh.. you remember that linux is case sensitive.. x11 isn't the same as X11
2007-03-01T14:59:00.000Z	Slart	colbert	check this post http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=184644 it's for an older version of ubuntu but I think it will work
2007-03-01T15:00:00.000Z	colbert	Slart	I just browsed and I have up to /etc/X11 but xinitrc.d isn't there, just a file called xinitrc
2007-03-01T15:02:00.000Z	Slart	colbert	read the webpage again.. it's /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.d/mouse  and I said use "gksudo gedit" not "sudo gedit"
2007-03-01T15:03:00.000Z	colbert	Slart	I just edited xorg.conf, must I reboot now to take effect ??
2007-03-01T15:04:00.000Z	Slart	colbert	nope.. just restart X but pressing ctrl+alt+backspace.. it will kill any x programs running (irc for example) and restart X
2007-03-01T15:21:00.000Z	colbert	Slart	I ran into a problem, Ubuntu X server failed and said something about the Device "configured mouse" being wrong in the xorg.conf, and it boots into terminal but it can't open display to gedit.. I'm in Vista now, I think the only way is to mount Ubuntu drive in here and edit the xorg.conf, how can I do it ??
2007-03-01T15:22:00.000Z	Slart	colbert	ouch.. I have no idea if Vista can mount ext3 or reiserFS partitions.. last version of windos I used was win2k
2007-03-01T15:23:00.000Z	colbert	Slart	I have XP set up too, would it work better from there ??
2007-03-01T15:23:00.000Z	Slart	colbert	I would guess you'd have to get some third party drivers.. I'm would be very surprised if microsoft included drivers for other file systems than their own
2007-03-01T15:24:00.000Z	colbert	Slart	Can I mount my Ubuntu drive in XP ?
2007-03-01T15:24:00.000Z	Slart	colbert	xp isn't much better..I _know_ xp can't mount ext3/reiserfs.. with Vista I'm just not sure
2007-03-01T15:25:00.000Z	colbert	Slart	Dang, then how can go about editing the xorg.conf since I can't get into Gnome? Is there some other option in GRUB or something ?? There must be a way ?
2007-03-01T15:25:00.000Z	Slart	colbert	you can always just type "sudo editor /etc/X11/xorg.conf" that will give you a text mode editor
2007-03-01T15:25:00.000Z	colbert	Slart	Will give 'er a go, brb
2007-03-01T15:34:00.000Z	colbert	Slart	Well that worked, I'm back in Ubuntu fine, but no change in the mouse buttons :( :(
