2008-08-17T12:43:00.000Z	Flannel	Uplink	little sister friendly, correct.
2008-08-20T06:10:00.000Z	Flannel	Uplink	As far as IDEs go, check out anjuta, or eclipse (with cdt)
2008-08-20T06:11:00.000Z	Flannel	Uplink	Indeed, you'll need a compiler.  install build-essential, and you'll have the compiler and stuff.
2008-08-20T06:12:00.000Z	Uplink	Flannel	i have build-essential... but i dont see it where to open it
2008-08-20T06:12:00.000Z	Flannel	Uplink	you don't open it, compilers are command line things.  Which is why you probably want an IDE
2008-08-20T06:13:00.000Z	Flannel	Uplink	anjuta or eclipse (with -cdt)
