2005-06-18T11:59:00.000Z	FR500		btw, what is a "fork"
2005-06-18T12:00:00.000Z	nalioth	FR500	a fork is when someon takes the source code, runs away in another direction then the original code writer(s)
2005-06-18T12:01:00.000Z	nalioth	FR500	sorta like the theory of evolution
2005-06-18T12:01:00.000Z	FR500	nalioth	ok
2005-10-04T12:01:00.000Z	nalioth	FR500	why would you? you forced it into a situation of breakage
2005-10-04T12:11:00.000Z	FR500	nalioth	but it works just fine with forcing depends
2005-10-04T12:12:00.000Z	nalioth	FR500	open what?
2005-10-04T12:14:00.000Z	FR500	nalioth	that is the lib i need
2005-10-04T13:29:00.000Z	nalioth	FR500	not so
2005-10-04T13:30:00.000Z	nalioth	FR500	parted or ntfsresize will do it
2005-10-04T13:31:00.000Z	FR500	nalioth	but pmagic is far easier
2005-10-04T13:31:00.000Z	nalioth	FR500	and costly
2005-10-24T09:29:00.000Z	nalioth	FR500	i do not. use xfce4 or lighter
2005-10-24T09:29:00.000Z	FR500	nalioth	it's a PIV i recovered form scratch 200gb hdd and 64mb ram and a geforce 2 i think
2005-10-24T09:30:00.000Z	nalioth	FR500	methinks you should add some ram to it
2005-10-24T09:30:00.000Z	FR500	nalioth	it uses rimms hard to find em now
2005-10-24T09:31:00.000Z	nalioth	FR500	obviously i'm missing out on what a PIV is
2005-10-24T09:31:00.000Z	FR500	nalioth	P4 sorry
