2006-06-01T16:26:00.000Z	Chousuke		hm
2006-06-01T16:26:00.000Z	Chousuke		I don't even have a CD to burn Ubuntu on. :/
2006-06-01T05:03:00.000Z	Chousuke		Do they yet have Apple powerbook suspend support on Dapper?
2006-06-01T05:03:00.000Z	Chousuke		it didn't work on breezy.
2006-06-01T05:04:00.000Z	dabaR	Chousuke	yes.
2006-06-01T05:04:00.000Z	Chousuke	dabaR	Are you sure?
2006-06-01T05:04:00.000Z	dabaR	Chousuke	you mean to make it go to sleep/
2006-06-01T05:04:00.000Z	Chousuke	dabaR	yeah.
2006-06-01T05:05:00.000Z	Chousuke	dabaR	I have a 1.33GHz powerbook.
2006-06-01T05:05:00.000Z	dabaR	Chousuke	yep, has been working for a while. Dunno whether they still have the right option in the shutdown menu, though. I have one right here too, talking to you from it. the newest powerbook.
2006-06-01T05:05:00.000Z	Chousuke	dabaR	My powerbook isn't the newest one.
2006-06-01T05:06:00.000Z	Chousuke	dabaR	did your suspend work on breezy too?
2006-06-01T05:06:00.000Z	dabaR	Chousuke	heard of a live CD? aka desktop CD? you could use it to test. No it did not work in breezy
2006-06-01T05:06:00.000Z	Chousuke	dabaR	hmmh.
2006-06-01T05:06:00.000Z	dabaR	Chousuke	ya, really, not much I can tell you..
2006-06-01T05:07:00.000Z	Chousuke	dabaR	how about airport extreme?
2006-06-01T05:09:00.000Z	dabaR	Chousuke	works, however, still buggy, and I have come to a point where I will only use the drivers on a separate partition than my production one.
2006-06-01T05:09:00.000Z	Chousuke	dabaR	alright.
2006-06-01T05:10:00.000Z	dabaR	Chousuke	however, my card is slightly diff from yours, afaik, so you may have better luck.
2006-06-01T05:10:00.000Z	Chousuke	dabaR	it's unlikely I'll transfer completely to Ubuntu, but I'll have to check it out :)
2006-06-01T05:11:00.000Z	dabaR	Chousuke	ya, very slick OS.
2006-06-01T05:11:00.000Z	Chousuke	dabaR	on x86 machines I'd have Ubuntu, but since I can run OS X on my powerbook, I don't have a real need for Ubuntu :)
2006-06-01T05:12:00.000Z	dabaR	Chousuke	you must be either good with OSX, or just not use computers that much
2006-06-01T05:12:00.000Z	Chousuke	dabaR	I'm the former then I guess, because I don't really fit into the latter category.
