2010-03-26T10:47:00.000Z	almoxarife	Zenker	using synaptic, get every plugin for nautilus that makes sense to you, one of them is going to be sudo, works great for me
2010-03-26T10:53:00.000Z	Zenker	almoxarife	i dont see nautilus-sudo i do see nautilus-gksu is that the one?
2010-03-26T10:54:00.000Z	almoxarife	Zenker	let me see
2010-03-26T10:55:00.000Z	almoxarife	Zenker	that's the one gksu

2010-03-26T11:03:00.000Z	Zenker	almoxarife	that didnt work, i still cant (for example) open the lost+found folder, ill just make a launcher w sudo nautilus that'll work wont it?
2010-03-26T11:06:00.000Z	Zenker	almoxarife	oh never mind i can right click and "open as administrator" now heh, thats good enough
2010-03-26T11:28:00.000Z	almoxarife	Zenker	at their web site they show a .deb for it in 9.04
2010-03-26T12:34:00.000Z	almoxarife	Zenker	were you the guy that asked about nautilus?
2010-03-26T12:35:00.000Z	Zenker	almoxarife	yep, i figd out that i can right click and open as administrator :)
2010-03-26T12:36:00.000Z	almoxarife	Zenker	that script on the web, copy paste it to a empty file on your desktop
2010-03-26T12:39:00.000Z	Zenker	almoxarife	ok, then what do i do, it says something about makin it executable?
2010-03-26T12:46:00.000Z	almoxarife	Zenker	now readup on turning that txt file into a executable script,http://www.linuxconfig.org/Bash_scripting_Tutorial
2010-03-26T12:47:00.000Z	Zenker	almoxarife	i think i need to use the chmod command but i dont know what modifiers  to use
2010-03-26T12:49:00.000Z	almoxarife	Zenker	Nisstyre65: chmod +x script.sh <-thnks :)
2010-03-26T13:22:00.000Z	Zenker	almoxarife	i give up it just changes to a solid blue background, ive tired /home/lappie/Pictures/Backgrounds and leaving the $home/home/lappie/Pictures/Backgrounds like this, idk, i need to act learn about scripting 1st i guess
2010-03-28T12:10:00.000Z	almoxarife	Zenker	the first option usually
2010-03-28T12:12:00.000Z	Zenker	almoxarife	thats what i thought untill i installed ubuntustudio and noticed that the entry for that shows the studio screen at start up, but the other only show it at shutdown, does it even matter?
2010-03-28T12:14:00.000Z	almoxarife	Zenker	I am not sure what you mean, the first option usually takes you to ubuntu, the second is for diags and the rest depend on what else is on your machine, I assume that is what you are seeing
2010-03-28T12:17:00.000Z	Zenker	almoxarife	oh, what i see is a few diff versions i guess, idk exactly off the top of my head but its like 2.1 n some numbers and 1.6 n some numbers and one of them ends in 2 letters, that one shows the ubuntustudio start up screen. the others do not but they show the ubuntustuio shutdown screen
