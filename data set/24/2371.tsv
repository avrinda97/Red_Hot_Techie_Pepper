2009-10-06T02:57:00.000Z	vge	aina	does it beep when your booting your computer?
2009-10-06T02:58:00.000Z	aina	vge	do you mean before the grub process ?
2009-10-06T02:58:00.000Z	vge	aina	well, usually internal speaker beeps when bios is done with checking
2009-10-06T02:59:00.000Z	vge	aina	so headphones work but internal wont?
2009-10-06T03:01:00.000Z	aina	vge	well that's what happening actually
2009-10-06T03:01:00.000Z	vge	aina	has the internal ever worked?

2009-10-06T03:02:00.000Z	aina	vge	i mean with older version of ubuntu
2009-10-06T03:02:00.000Z	vge	aina	so it got broken in the process when you were updating?
2009-10-06T03:02:00.000Z	aina	vge	i have this pbm since i upgraded from this older version
2009-10-06T03:03:00.000Z	aina	vge	that's right : after the upgrade it didn't work anymore ...
2009-10-06T03:06:00.000Z	aina	vge	what would you suggest me to do ?
2009-10-06T03:07:00.000Z	vge	aina	i don't know to be exact
