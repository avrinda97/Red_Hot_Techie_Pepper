2006-05-24T14:55:00.000Z	T`2		is there a shortcut for ubunto to install all the dev tools?
2006-05-24T14:55:00.000Z	T`2		like gcc, libraries, make, etc..?
2006-05-24T14:55:00.000Z	DBO	T`2	basic stuff "sudo apt-get install build-essential gcc"
2006-05-24T14:56:00.000Z	T`2	DBO	is build-essential a package?
2006-05-24T14:56:00.000Z	DBO	T`2	sure is
2006-05-24T15:26:00.000Z	DBO	T`2	depends on who you are... I dont think so, but most people I help in here stare at me and foam at the mouth when I mention chroot...
2006-05-24T15:26:00.000Z	DBO	T`2	because it sounds hard
2006-05-24T15:27:00.000Z	T`2	DBO	i'm compiling some code and i get errors about  Error: suffix or operands invalid for `pop'
2006-05-24T15:27:00.000Z	T`2	DBO	that looks like a linking problem for the assembler which thinks its compilng for 64 bti or somthing
2006-05-24T15:27:00.000Z	T`2	DBO	where can i get the latest method to setup 32-bit chroot ?
2006-05-24T15:38:00.000Z	T`2	DBO	do u have an amd64 machien?
2006-05-24T15:38:00.000Z	DBO	T`2	yes, but I dont use 64 bit because its a pain still
2006-05-24T15:39:00.000Z	T`2	DBO	oh.. thats what i was debating just now.. if i should really use this 64 bit.. heh
2006-05-24T15:39:00.000Z	T`2	DBO	compiling/running 32bit apps seem to be uberpainful
2006-05-24T15:39:00.000Z	T`2	DBO	how much performance do we loose though?
2006-05-24T15:39:00.000Z	DBO	T`2	thats why =)
2006-05-24T15:39:00.000Z	DBO	T`2	not much at all...
2006-05-24T15:39:00.000Z	T`2	DBO	oh really.. sure?
2006-05-24T15:39:00.000Z	T`2	DBO	so nothing noticable and stuff.. ?
2006-05-24T15:39:00.000Z	DBO	T`2	pretty much...
2006-05-24T15:41:00.000Z	T`2	DBO	ok thats enough reason for me ;)... downloading xubuntu for 32bit now.. heh
2006-05-24T15:48:00.000Z	T`2	DBO	if i download a binary like vmware (which only comes in 32-bit), can i run it in ubuntu 64 without chroot?
2006-05-24T16:44:00.000Z	T`2	DBO	any idea on what that locae prob?
2006-05-24T16:45:00.000Z	DBO	T`2	I wont lie, I didnt even look at it... Im just a volunteer...
