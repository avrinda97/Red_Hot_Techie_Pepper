2012-01-17T19:24:00.000Z	ballison		how do i disable the DOCK/ DASH on the lefthand side of the screen and return to "normal ubuntu"?
2012-01-17T19:24:00.000Z	ballison		i hate the giant DOCK/ DASH
2012-01-17T19:25:00.000Z	ballison		I want to be able to right click the menu bar and add my own launcher like in the older version of ubuntu.
2012-01-17T19:26:00.000Z	ballison		just run "sudo apt-get install gnome-session-failback" ??
2012-01-17T19:28:00.000Z	ballison		i installed "gnome-session-fallback" and logged out and back in using it.  YAY!
2012-01-17T19:29:00.000Z	ballison		but --- i don't have the ability to right click the menu and have a launcher bar
2012-01-17T19:29:00.000Z	LjL	ballison	GNOME 3 is not GNOME 2, no matter which shell you use you won't have all the features from GNOME 2 you're used to...
2012-01-17T19:30:00.000Z	ballison	babilen	i had to log out and log back in to get gnome-session-failback
2012-01-17T19:30:00.000Z	ballison		you have to log out to activate it.
2012-01-17T19:30:00.000Z	ballison		gnome-shell?  this has nothing to do with shells.
2012-01-17T19:30:00.000Z	ballison		i'm trying to have a LAUNCHER BAR
2012-01-17T19:30:00.000Z	LjL	ballison	uh? it has everything to do with shells.
2012-01-17T19:31:00.000Z	ballison		like i used to .... i could right click and say "Add Launcher APplication"
2012-01-17T19:31:00.000Z	LjL	ballison	unless you think "shell" is something else than we're discussing.
2012-01-17T19:31:00.000Z	ballison		shell is a terminal with a problem CLI
2012-01-17T19:31:00.000Z	ballison		prompt
2012-01-17T19:31:00.000Z	LjL	ballison	that's a very reductive definition of "shell", so, no.
2012-01-17T19:31:00.000Z	ballison		this has NOTHING to do with my "shell"
2012-01-17T19:31:00.000Z	ballison		my shell is bash if you want to know
2012-01-17T19:31:00.000Z	ballison		echo $SHELL
2012-01-17T19:32:00.000Z	LjL	ballison	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing) have fun
2012-01-17T19:32:00.000Z	ballison		i'm talking about the fact that I can't right click on the bar at the top and add a launcher app.  like for Firefox or xterm...
2012-01-17T19:32:00.000Z	LjL	ballison	GNOME-Shell is a shell. Unity is a shell. GNOME Fallback is a shell.
2012-01-17T19:32:00.000Z	LjL	ballison	yes, you can't do that with GNOME 3 to my knowledge, although i'm not a GNOME user.
