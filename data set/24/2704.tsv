2008-10-23T06:13:00.000Z	DasEi		carrera:tried alsa ?
2008-10-23T06:13:00.000Z	carrera	DasEi	didn't repeat. I was asked to be more specific
2008-10-23T06:13:00.000Z	carrera	DasEi	I guess as I used the alsamixer to change volumes
2008-10-23T06:18:00.000Z	carrera	DasEi	no output from modprobe snd_hda_intel
2008-10-23T06:21:00.000Z	carrera	DasEi	I don't have  alsamisergui but I can run alsamixer without any problems
2008-10-23T06:21:00.000Z	DasEi	carrera	same, does it show the right s-card in its title ?
2008-10-23T06:22:00.000Z	carrera	DasEi	lemme run it again pls
2008-10-23T06:24:00.000Z	carrera	DasEi	Card: HDA Intel. Chip: Analog Devices AD1988B. which seems correct
2008-10-23T06:24:00.000Z	carrera	DasEi	aplay -l output:  card 0: Intel [HDA Intel], device 0: AD198x Analog [AD198x Analog]
2008-10-23T06:25:00.000Z	DasEi	carrera	so right driver is installed, the main part
2008-10-23T06:25:00.000Z	carrera	DasEi	that's great but what else could be wrong?
2008-10-23T06:25:00.000Z	DasEi	carrera	apps>preferences>sound           ...set to alsa, right default card...
2008-10-23T06:27:00.000Z	carrera	DasEi	just looked it up in my Asus P5E manual and it's bang on. Manual says ADI 1988B
2008-10-23T06:28:00.000Z	carrera	DasEi	I've all 4 set to ALSA and my Default Mixer Tracks set to HDA Intel (Alsa Mixer)
2008-10-23T06:31:00.000Z	carrera	DasEi	did that but I still get choppy sound
2008-10-23T06:31:00.000Z	carrera	DasEi	I've that page loaded
2008-10-23T06:32:00.000Z	carrera	DasEi	but I was wondering if the problem could be resolved without having to rebuild new kernel modules
2008-10-23T06:33:00.000Z	carrera	DasEi	it sacred me when he said, "(Please read the Caveats section!)"
2008-10-23T06:35:00.000Z	carrera	DasEi	I've only seen "backports" in the Software Sources, Update tab. I don't even know what a backport is, let alone create one!
2008-10-23T06:40:00.000Z	carrera	DasEi	how do u know that?
2008-10-23T06:41:00.000Z	carrera	DasEi	cool. Thanks for all your help dude!
2008-10-23T06:44:00.000Z	carrera	DasEi	would trying OSS instead of ALSA help?
2008-10-23T06:47:00.000Z	carrera	DasEi	I checked those already. Mine are below the sliders and they are mostly green EXPECT Analog M
