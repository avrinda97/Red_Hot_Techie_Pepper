2005-11-08T15:54:00.000Z	tidali		Hello, Im trying to install ubuntu yet when I get up to the partitioning part I get the following error: The Attempt To Mount A Filesystem with type ext3 in IDE1 (partition #1 at HDA1  a / failed. You may resume partitioning from the partitioning menu Do you want to resume partitioning? -- however when I do it over, I still get the same error both manually and automatic.
2005-11-08T15:55:00.000Z	tidali		Can someone help me please
2005-11-08T15:55:00.000Z	tidali		????
2005-11-08T15:56:00.000Z	thoreauputic	tidali	is hda1 actually an ext3 partition?
2005-11-08T15:57:00.000Z	tidali	thoreauputic	how could I check if hda1 is ext3?
2005-11-08T15:58:00.000Z	thoreauputic	tidali	are you installing only ubuntu, or do you have a windows partition ?
2005-11-08T15:58:00.000Z	tidali	thoreauputic	it has windows on it currently
2005-11-08T15:59:00.000Z	thoreauputic	tidali	if you aren't keeping windows, jsut let ubuntu automatically use the whole disc
2005-11-08T15:59:00.000Z	tidali	thoreauputic	that is what i chose...
2005-11-08T16:00:00.000Z	thoreauputic	tidali	erm, did you choose to let it automatically partition?
2005-11-08T16:00:00.000Z	tidali	thoreauputic	yes sir....
2005-11-08T16:00:00.000Z	thoreauputic	tidali	then I'm confused too ...
2005-11-08T16:01:00.000Z	thoreauputic	tidali	you need to let the installer format your partitions, yes
2005-11-08T16:02:00.000Z	thoreauputic	tidali	hard to remember since we only install once usually :)
2005-11-08T16:03:00.000Z	thoreauputic	tidali	if you are letting ubuntu use the whole drive you don't need to be cautious :)
2005-11-08T16:03:00.000Z	thoreauputic	tidali	you don't need to
2005-11-08T16:06:00.000Z	thoreauputic	tidali	possible - or a bad disc
2005-11-08T16:06:00.000Z	thoreauputic	tidali	did you burn the disc or is it a shipit disc?
2005-11-08T16:07:00.000Z	tidali	thoreauputic	burnt it
2005-11-08T16:07:00.000Z	thoreauputic	tidali	you know it's a good disc? You checked it?
2005-11-08T16:08:00.000Z	tidali	thoreauputic	I run ubuntu on four other computers
2005-11-08T16:08:00.000Z	thoreauputic	tidali	right, but you meantioned it's scratched ;)
2005-11-08T16:09:00.000Z	thoreauputic	tidali	right - assuming you want t o blow windows away
2005-11-08T16:10:00.000Z	thoreauputic	tidali	yes
