2006-06-13T07:11:00.000Z	vanden	gareth	use sudo mv in a terminal
2006-06-13T07:21:00.000Z	vanden	gareth	do you know how to move a file at the command line?
2006-06-13T07:21:00.000Z	gareth	vanden	no!
2006-06-13T07:22:00.000Z	vanden	gareth	open a terminal. type man mv
2006-06-13T07:22:00.000Z	vanden	gareth	do you know how to get a terminal?
2006-06-13T07:24:00.000Z	vanden	gareth	OK, ask if stuck. Meanwhile, sudo is a command that lets you run commands as though you were another user. sudo mv (without a user specified) will run the mv as though you were root.
2006-06-13T07:25:00.000Z	vanden	gareth	ubuntu uses sudo rather than root accounts by default. see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RootSudo
2006-06-13T07:25:00.000Z	vanden	gareth	yes, but your user password, not a root account pswd
2006-06-13T07:27:00.000Z	vanden	gareth	typed too fast. No, sudo doesn't ask for a root account password. It wants the password of the account that runs sudo. Details I don't recall determine which accoutns can sudo with rootlike power. But the primary user account can, by default.
2006-06-13T07:29:00.000Z	gareth	vanden	the file is in home/gareth/temp stuff - does sudo mv /home/gareth/temp stuff -t /usr/lib/gimp/2.0/plug-ins look reasonable?
2006-06-13T07:29:00.000Z	vanden	gareth	there is a space in the file name?
2006-06-13T07:30:00.000Z	vanden	gareth	if so, don't do that :-)
2006-06-13T07:30:00.000Z	gareth	vanden	yes there is. I'll rename it without the space. Do you think the command looks ok then?
2006-06-13T07:31:00.000Z	vanden	gareth	looks good to me, but I'm no hacker :-) (Save a copy first just to be sure.)
2006-06-13T07:31:00.000Z	vanden	gareth	did it work out?
2006-06-13T07:34:00.000Z	gareth	vanden	no - is it case sensitive?
2006-06-13T07:34:00.000Z	vanden	gareth	I believe it is
2006-06-13T07:34:00.000Z	vanden	gareth	didn't work how?
2006-06-13T07:37:00.000Z	gareth	vanden	looks like it's a case senstive issue. It originally said no such directoy on the input directory, but I've corrected the case, and now  it says no such destination - so I'm going to check the case for that
2006-06-13T07:37:00.000Z	vanden	gareth	do you know about tab completion?
2006-06-13T07:38:00.000Z	vanden	gareth	can save typing and *mistyping*. enter a letter or two of the path on the cmd line and hit tab.
2006-06-13T07:39:00.000Z	vanden	gareth	if nothing happens the first tab hit, do it again
2006-06-13T07:41:00.000Z	gareth	vanden	I've corrected the spelling and case, and it's worked. Many thanks for your help.
2006-06-13T07:41:00.000Z	vanden	gareth	NP :-)
