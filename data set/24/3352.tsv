2008-09-10T16:49:00.000Z	DRMacIver		So, I'm being a complete cretin. I'm trying to get wireless working on my laptop (I've never bothered in the past). All the information out there these days basically says "Click on NetworkManager and it just works". Unfortunately a) I can't find NetworkManager *anywhere* in the interface and b) When I try to run it from the console it demands to be run as root, yet when I run it as root it returns instantly and doesn't do a blasted thing
2008-09-10T16:49:00.000Z	DRMacIver		What am I missng?
2008-09-10T16:49:00.000Z	DRMacIver		(I'm running hardy heron)
2008-09-10T16:49:00.000Z	Haegin	DRMacIver	what version of ubuntu?
2008-09-10T16:50:00.000Z	DRMacIver	Haegin	Hardy Heron
2008-09-10T16:50:00.000Z	Haegin	DRMacIver	ok, then can you see the network icon up near the clock?
2008-09-10T16:50:00.000Z	DRMacIver	Haegin	Yes. It seems to only list wired networks
2008-09-10T16:51:00.000Z	DRMacIver	Haegin	Ah. Is that the fabled NetworkManager I should be looking at? This isn't obvious from any of the UI info it provides. :)
2008-09-10T16:51:00.000Z	Haegin	DRMacIver	then it probably cannot see your wireless card so you will need drivers. what card do you have?
2008-09-10T16:52:00.000Z	DRMacIver	Haegin	The proprietary hardware drivers menu suggests that "Support for Atheros 802.11 wirless LAN cards" is installed, enabled and in use
2008-09-10T16:52:00.000Z	Haegin	DRMacIver	odd, right click on the nm-applet icon (the network icon you checked before) and make sure wireless is enabled
2008-09-10T16:53:00.000Z	DRMacIver	Haegin	The enable networking checkbox? It's ticked
2008-09-10T17:00:00.000Z	Haegin	DRMacIver	run lspci and pastebin the output
2008-09-10T17:02:00.000Z	Haegin	DRMacIver	02:00.0 Ethernet controller: Atheros Communications Inc. AR242x 802.11abg Wireless PCI Express Adapter (rev 01) <- that is your wireless
2008-09-10T17:12:00.000Z	Haegin	DRMacIver	and you black listed ath5k and installed madwifi?
2008-09-10T17:13:00.000Z	Haegin	DRMacIver	ok, there are two atheros drivers. madwifi which is stable, works but is proprietary and ath5k which is new, fast, cool, open but doesn't work on all hardware
2008-09-10T17:17:00.000Z	Haegin	DRMacIver	can you pastebin the output from lsmod please?
2008-09-10T17:18:00.000Z	DRMacIver	Haegin	http://pastebin.com/f1b9e4e02
2008-09-10T17:19:00.000Z	Haegin	DRMacIver	and now can you pastebin the output of ifconfig pls
2008-09-10T17:34:00.000Z	DRMacIver	Haegin	Thanks very much for your help.
2008-09-10T17:35:00.000Z	Haegin	DRMacIver	that's ok, I didn't do much tbh :) gladit is working
2008-09-10T17:36:00.000Z	DRMacIver	Haegin	You spent time helping me. That counts for a fair bit in my book regardless of what was achieved. :)
2008-09-10T17:37:00.000Z	Haegin	DRMacIver	it's more interesting than work atm (writing test cases isn't the most exciting)
2008-09-10T17:38:00.000Z	DRMacIver	Haegin	Heh. I find writing test cases kindof satisfying sometimes.
