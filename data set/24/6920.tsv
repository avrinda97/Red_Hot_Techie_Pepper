2005-09-19T12:41:00.000Z	erUSUL	djm62	yes it is
2005-11-15T16:37:00.000Z	erUSUL	djm62	open a bug in bugzilla
2005-11-15T16:37:00.000Z	djm62	erUSUL	good call, but it's very hw specific
2005-11-15T16:38:00.000Z	djm62	erUSUL	and I'm not sure where the bug is (installer?)
2005-12-01T17:44:00.000Z	erUSUL	djm62	kernel developers are against stable drivers apis with all their heart
2005-12-01T17:45:00.000Z	djm62	erUSUL	you mean now, or will all future developers be against them? ;)
2005-12-01T17:45:00.000Z	erUSUL	djm62	now and in the future
2005-12-01T17:46:00.000Z	djm62	erUSUL	I defer to your time travelling skillz, sir
2005-12-01T17:53:00.000Z	erUSUL	djm62	read this from a important kernel developer http://www.kroah.com/log/2005/11/03/
2005-12-01T17:54:00.000Z	djm62	erUSUL	I know the current position...I have come to expect linux to outlast the authors
2005-12-01T17:55:00.000Z	erUSUL	djm62	and this from Linus himself http://paste.ubuntulinux.nl/5056
2005-12-01T17:57:00.000Z	djm62	erUSUL	this still doesn't amount to clairvoyance...in time, things will change.  my prediction is less categorical than yours
2005-12-01T17:58:00.000Z	erUSUL	djm62	the quote from Linus is about legal issues binary only drivers in linux are alegal (if not ilegal)
2005-12-01T06:01:00.000Z	djm62	erUSUL	how long is your long run? seriously, I'm not speculating out of ignorance: companies want this.  they have money, it will happen one way or another.  Also there will be more stability in the kernel over time, unless they intentionally break compatibility to stop interactions they don't like (remind you of anyone?)
2005-12-01T06:03:00.000Z	erUSUL	djm62	the gpl is desgned precisaly to keep the things as they are you can turn a BSD into comercial crap but you can not turn the linux kernel into windows
2005-12-01T06:03:00.000Z	djm62	erUSUL	wtf? I wasn't implying that, or anything like that
2005-12-01T06:03:00.000Z	djm62	erUSUL	this isn't an ideological thing
2005-12-01T06:04:00.000Z	djm62	erUSUL	although it is an #ubuntu-offtopic thing, come to think of it
2005-12-01T06:05:00.000Z	erUSUL	djm62	i read lkml sometimes and people there are "faighting" against companies persuing stable APIS
2005-12-01T06:06:00.000Z	djm62	erUSUL	-offtopic if you want to discuss forward (bad to do this in the support channel)
2005-12-01T06:07:00.000Z	erUSUL	djm62	you are right. my bad
2007-11-16T19:59:00.000Z	erUSUL	djm62	it will take the things that have not been updated from the cd
2007-11-16T20:00:00.000Z	djm62	erUSUL	so that should be at most a couple of hundred meg?
2007-11-16T20:00:00.000Z	erUSUL	djm62	it depends on what you have installed on your machine
