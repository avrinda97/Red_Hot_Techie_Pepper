2005-05-18T11:30:00.000Z	Gatton		bwahaha sounds like something i would do :-)
2005-05-18T11:32:00.000Z	Gatton		yes i get a complaint from GPG :-)
2005-05-18T11:33:00.000Z	Gatton		heh :)
2005-05-18T11:34:00.000Z	Gatton		Install these packages without verification?  Yes please :)
2005-05-18T11:35:00.000Z	Gatton		Linux/Burger King...have it your way
2005-05-18T11:36:00.000Z	loren	Gatton	that'd be scary
2005-05-18T11:43:00.000Z	Gatton	loren	you could try VidaLinux. It's gentoo based
2005-05-18T11:43:00.000Z	loren	Gatton	i was going to download that but man oh man i've downloaded so many linuxes
2005-05-18T11:43:00.000Z	loren	Gatton	im still considering it
2005-05-18T11:43:00.000Z	Gatton	loren	i generally liked it but dumped it only because the free version doesn't have very many packages...
2005-05-18T11:44:00.000Z	loren	Gatton	yeah? hmmh yeah how was the erm, portage system?
2005-05-18T11:44:00.000Z	Gatton	loren	worked pretty darn well for me
2005-05-18T11:45:00.000Z	loren	Gatton	man i'm itching to try that portage system lol, portage + suse + ubuntu stability would totally rock
2005-05-18T11:45:00.000Z	Gatton	loren	it has a graphical front end to portage but i found it easier to just use the command. kinda like apt-get as opposed to using kynaptic or synaptic :)
2005-05-18T11:46:00.000Z	loren	Gatton	yeah i know what you mean, the front ends are nice to have for most people i like using both lol, i usually swap back and forth
2005-05-18T11:48:00.000Z	Gatton	loren	that's desktop environment buddy ;)
2005-05-18T11:51:00.000Z	Gatton	loren	bah. Acqua theme. I just punch the KVM switch and have the real thing ;)
2005-05-18T11:52:00.000Z	loren	Gatton	i hate you rofl, i dont own any macs unfortunatly so i can't mess with em, thats why i picked up linux, windows got boring
2005-05-18T11:52:00.000Z	Gatton	loren	agreed. I could certainly have saved the $800 for the emac. Guess Steve Jobs is just too darn persuasive
2005-05-18T11:54:00.000Z	loren	Gatton	yeah 800 is nice to save lol, as for being persuasive, i'll start my own BSD distro and it'll have the aqua theme as default and look like a mac by default lol, i'll prolly be sued but you have to admit it'd be big eh? oh and installable on PPC rofl
2005-05-18T11:54:00.000Z	Gatton	loren	just send me the link to the ftp server when you finish eh? ;)
2005-05-18T11:54:00.000Z	loren	Gatton	haha :) i will lol
2005-05-18T11:55:00.000Z	loren	Gatton	then i'll sell the company to some foreign company and they'll kill the Apple
2005-05-18T11:55:00.000Z	Gatton	loren	nooooooooooooo :)
