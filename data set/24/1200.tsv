2010-05-24T18:52:00.000Z	godricbrutus		im trying to use skype, but the only devices that show in my 'devices' are 'PulseAudioServer' i made a test call, and it doesn't work. Thanks in advance for any help
2010-05-24T18:54:00.000Z	GibbaTheHutt	godricbrutus	check the obvious that the mic isn't muted or something (I installed gnome alsa mixer to check)
2010-05-24T18:54:00.000Z	godricbrutus	GibbaTheHutt	i have checked in alsamixer already
2010-05-24T18:54:00.000Z	godricbrutus	GibbaTheHutt	the only available device is pulseaudio server
2010-05-24T18:55:00.000Z	GibbaTheHutt	godricbrutus	thats the same for me, but Skype works fine
2010-05-24T18:55:00.000Z	GibbaTheHutt	godricbrutus	often I find the volume quite low though
2010-05-24T18:55:00.000Z	godricbrutus	GibbaTheHutt	nothing is muted
2010-05-24T18:56:00.000Z	GibbaTheHutt	godricbrutus	if you go to system->prefs->sound and speak, do you see the input line moving in relation to your voice level ?
2010-05-24T18:56:00.000Z	GibbaTheHutt	godricbrutus	(on the input tab I mean)
2010-05-24T18:56:00.000Z	godricbrutus	GibbaTheHutt	no
2010-05-24T18:57:00.000Z	GibbaTheHutt	godricbrutus	so I think that needs fixing before skype will work
2010-05-24T18:57:00.000Z	godricbrutus	GibbaTheHutt	i dont know how to fix it
2010-05-24T18:57:00.000Z	GibbaTheHutt	godricbrutus	what options are there at the bottom for your sound input devices ?
2010-05-24T18:58:00.000Z	godricbrutus	GibbaTheHutt	internal audio digital stereo (iec958)
2010-05-24T18:58:00.000Z	godricbrutus	GibbaTheHutt	just that
2010-05-24T18:59:00.000Z	GibbaTheHutt	godricbrutus	and mic level is up and not muted in alsa-mixer I assume. Is there anything you have tested with the mic to be sure it works connected ?
2010-05-24T18:59:00.000Z	godricbrutus	GibbaTheHutt	everything is up in alsamixer
2010-05-24T19:00:00.000Z	GibbaTheHutt	godricbrutus	sure the mic is on? :)
2010-05-24T19:00:00.000Z	godricbrutus	GibbaTheHutt	i've only tested the mic in skype, what you told me to do here, os x, and windows. they work in os x and windows
2010-05-24T19:00:00.000Z	godricbrutus	GibbaTheHutt	im sure it is on
2010-05-24T19:01:00.000Z	godricbrutus	GibbaTheHutt	is there anything i can take a screen-shot of to show you?
2010-05-24T19:02:00.000Z	GibbaTheHutt	godricbrutus	in alsa-mixer, have you gone to edit->prefs and checked right device is showing ?
2010-05-24T19:03:00.000Z	godricbrutus	GibbaTheHutt	no
2010-05-24T19:06:00.000Z	godricbrutus	GibbaTheHutt	ok, i did that
