2007-10-11T12:48:00.000Z	Rijnzael		hi
2007-10-11T12:49:00.000Z	Rijnzael		would any of you have suggestions for a linux server distrobution which isn't ubuntu?
2007-10-11T12:50:00.000Z	Rijnzael		i'm researching which distro to install a new server
2007-10-11T12:50:00.000Z	Rijnzael		the 6 month dev cycle for ubuntu is nice
2007-10-11T12:50:00.000Z	Rijnzael		i'm just curious if there are others with a lower time frame for dev cycles, and/or update patches more quicky
2007-10-11T12:50:00.000Z	Rijnzael		quickly*
2007-10-11T12:50:00.000Z	Rijnzael		LAMP
2007-10-11T12:51:00.000Z	Rijnzael		gentoo eh?
2007-10-11T12:51:00.000Z	Rijnzael		i've never heard of gentoo being used for a server
2007-10-11T12:51:00.000Z	Rijnzael		only desktops
2007-10-11T12:52:00.000Z	oliver_g1	Rijnzael	try Debian testing or the latest in-development Ubuntu "release" if you want to be more up to date...
2007-10-11T12:53:00.000Z	Rijnzael	oliver_g1	i'm not updating, i'm researching ubuntu's speed in updating the repositories with new patches
2007-10-11T12:53:00.000Z	oliver_g1	Rijnzael	what kind of patches do you mean? Security fixes? normal bug fixes? new functionality?
2007-10-11T12:55:00.000Z	oliver_g1	Rijnzael	i guess security fixes come out at roughly the same time for all distros (as long as you use a still-supported release)
2007-10-11T12:55:00.000Z	Rijnzael	oliver_g1	k
2007-10-11T12:57:00.000Z	oliver_g1	Rijnzael	and if you want new functionality, it's not maintainable any more... The six-month cycle for Ubuntu is already too fast for my liking :-) as the updates do not create _exactly_ the same result as installing from scratch (so essentially the system degrades a bit with every update)
2007-10-11T12:57:00.000Z	Rijnzael	oliver_g1	thanks
2007-10-11T13:01:00.000Z	Rijnzael	oliver_g1	would you suggest incrementing my server's distro along new LTS releases?
2007-10-11T13:01:00.000Z	oliver_g1	Rijnzael	yes
2007-10-11T13:01:00.000Z	Rijnzael	oliver_g1	ok
2007-10-11T13:01:00.000Z	oliver_g1	Rijnzael	for servers, the LTS distro should be ok (IMHO)
2007-10-11T13:02:00.000Z	Rijnzael	oliver_g1	and then do a straight update when a new LTS release emerges?
2007-10-11T13:02:00.000Z	oliver_g1	Rijnzael	basically yes, but good question :-D
2007-10-11T13:03:00.000Z	oliver_g1	Rijnzael	I haven't done any LTS upgrade yet (duh :) but I guess when next Ubuntu LTS is out i will wait three months (to see if heavy problems get known) and then upgrade the server
