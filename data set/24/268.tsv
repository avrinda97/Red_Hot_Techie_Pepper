2012-01-25T06:43:00.000Z	urlin2u	nivyaj	you on the ubuntu right now the live cd?
2012-01-25T06:45:00.000Z	nivyaj	urlin2u	this is a back up HD-  that i was  using. I have ubuntu on a flash drive to boot, and windows CD. I'm cleaning up the HD to put both OSes on
2012-01-25T06:46:00.000Z	urlin2u	nivyaj	you just want the ubuntu on the extra HD?
2012-01-25T06:47:00.000Z	urlin2u	nivyaj	I see same HD.
2012-01-25T06:47:00.000Z	nivyaj	urlin2u	 both OSes.
2012-01-25T06:47:00.000Z	nivyaj		yea
2012-01-25T06:47:00.000Z	nivyaj		what happened was the HD crashed. So I've been running ubuntu on a smaller HD till I could deal with the backups.
2012-01-25T06:48:00.000Z	nivyaj	urlin2u	so i found the article on how to set up the partitions, I just want to know what's  going on there. amd to make sure i'm doing it right
2012-01-25T06:49:00.000Z	urlin2u	nivyaj	if your hd is a standard mbr setup you just have to be aware of max partition types, ethier 4 primaries which windows runs in, or 3 primaries and a extended that Ubuntu can go in, the extended allows more logical partitions to be added, and can have a ntfs there for a shared partition for ubuntu and windows.
2012-01-25T06:50:00.000Z	urlin2u	nivyaj	max in how many
2012-01-25T06:50:00.000Z	nivyaj	urlin2u	I cleared all the partitions on it.
2012-01-25T06:50:00.000Z	urlin2u	nivyaj	cool do you understand my post?
2012-01-25T06:51:00.000Z	nivyaj		no.
2012-01-25T06:51:00.000Z	nivyaj		:(
2012-01-25T06:51:00.000Z	urlin2u	nivyaj	so you have which windows release?
2012-01-25T06:51:00.000Z	nivyaj		vista 64
2012-01-25T06:52:00.000Z	urlin2u	nivyaj	you know how to do a custom install of it so the main partition is the size you want so you have unallocated space for ubuntu?
2012-01-25T06:52:00.000Z	urlin2u	nivyaj	vista that is
2012-01-25T06:54:00.000Z	nivyaj	urlin2u	 that's actually an issue. the HD is 300 GB- so I wanted to partition it in a way to not lose space.
2012-01-25T06:55:00.000Z	nivyaj	urlin2u	I was going to do 150 GB for windows (and windows programs), 90 for ubuntu and programs and the remainder for back-up
2012-01-25T06:56:00.000Z	urlin2u	nivyaj	 I see, you know how to install vista so it is that size on install from the vista partitioning gui?
2012-01-25T06:57:00.000Z	urlin2u	nivyaj	you might just get on the #windows channel for tat part really, I can't really explain all of its installation on this channel.
