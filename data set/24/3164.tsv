2008-10-05T03:14:00.000Z	bobertdos	smokeytheman	What browser are you using?
2008-10-05T03:17:00.000Z	bobertdos	smokeytheman	Can Konqueror list its plugins? I wouldn't know since I don't use K, but you might want to symlink to the plugin.
2008-10-05T03:19:00.000Z	smokeytheman	bobertdos	how do i symlink to the plugin? i do have nspluginwrapper if that helps
2008-10-05T03:21:00.000Z	bobertdos	smokeytheman	Well first, just to clarify, flash video isn't playing at all, right? Does about:plugins or something similar work in Konqueror?
2008-10-05T03:23:00.000Z	smokeytheman	bobertdos	i found the list of plugins
2008-10-05T03:25:00.000Z	bobertdos	smokeytheman	What's all in there? Pastebin if it's long, please.
2008-10-05T03:27:00.000Z	smokeytheman	bobertdos	i installed gnash which is messing everything up
2008-10-05T03:27:00.000Z	smokeytheman	bobertdos	i removed it but it didnt actually remove it so im trying to use strigi to search for all the instances of flashplugin-alternative but its not working either
2008-10-05T03:27:00.000Z	bobertdos	smokeytheman	gnash is evil, and it wars with Adobe's version, so purge gnash and then see if flashplugin-nonfree starts working the way it's supposed to.
2008-10-05T03:29:00.000Z	bobertdos	smokeytheman	oh, well, what about using locate to just locate flashplugin-alternative, or maybe some sort of so file. I don't know what the main .so is for gnash......
2008-10-05T03:32:00.000Z	bobertdos	smokeytheman	Does Konqueror have an advanced config menu? In firefox, there's the option to reveal the path of all the plugins. I'm wondering if Konqueror has something like that. It's been ages since I used K, but maybe I should so I can start helping K people better.
2008-10-05T03:33:00.000Z	bobertdos	smokeytheman	Well, if you just delete the so file for gnash, it shouldn't effect anything.
2008-10-05T03:35:00.000Z	bobertdos	smokeytheman	It can't hurt to just peek at what's in there.
2008-10-05T03:36:00.000Z	smokeytheman	bobertdos	im trying to delete it, i closed all instances of konqueror but it says acess denied
2008-10-05T03:37:00.000Z	bobertdos	smokeytheman	You would have to use sudo
2008-10-05T03:37:00.000Z	bobertdos	smokeytheman	or sudo rm
2008-10-05T03:41:00.000Z	smokeytheman	bobertdos	its finally working, thanks for your help
2008-10-05T03:41:00.000Z	bobertdos	smokeytheman	my pleasure, sir
2008-10-06T04:42:00.000Z	bobertdos	smokeytheman	Define "reset"

2008-10-06T04:46:00.000Z	bobertdos	smokeytheman	Wow, what the heck did you do?? :p
2008-10-06T04:47:00.000Z	smokeytheman	bobertdos	adept got frozed and had like 7 processes and when i closed them all that hapened
2008-10-06T04:53:00.000Z	bobertdos	smokeytheman	You could try reinstalling dpkg, I suppose.
