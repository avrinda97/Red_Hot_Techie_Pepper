2007-06-01T16:35:00.000Z	clearzen	Tru7h	I believe you have to have ntfs-3g installed to write to a NTFS partition
2007-06-01T16:36:00.000Z	clearzen	Tru7h	So goto accessories --> terminal sudo aptitiude install ntfs-3g
2007-06-01T16:36:00.000Z	Tru7h		Clearzen: You mean install ubuntu on an NTFS File system?
2007-06-01T16:36:00.000Z	clearzen	Tru7h	No to resize it
2007-06-01T16:36:00.000Z	clearzen	Tru7h	You want to use ext3 for the ubuntu partition
2007-06-01T16:36:00.000Z	Tru7h		Clearzen: Okay, yeah. Thats what I'm trying to do. I'll try that.
2007-06-01T16:37:00.000Z	Tru7h		Thanks
2007-06-01T16:37:00.000Z	clearzen	Tru7h	np
2007-06-01T16:39:00.000Z	Tru7h		Clearzen: I tried sudo aptitiude install ntfs-3g, but it said command not found, so I tried sudo apt-get install ntfs-3g and it ran through about 4 lines of stuff and said it couldn't find the package

2007-06-01T16:42:00.000Z	clearzen	Tru7h	I'm not entirely sure you need it in the first place to install but to download it enable the univery repos
2007-06-01T16:42:00.000Z	clearzen	Tru7h	One sec I'll give you directions
2007-06-01T16:42:00.000Z	Tru7h	clearzen	Thanks
2007-06-01T16:42:00.000Z	clearzen	Tru7h	btw it's aptitude I spelled it wrong the first time
2007-06-01T16:43:00.000Z	Tru7h		Clearzen: Ahh, I'll try that then
2007-06-01T16:44:00.000Z	clearzen		Go to system>>administration>>settings>>repositories> click them all and update
2007-06-01T16:45:00.000Z	clearzen		Tru7h:Go to system>>administration>>settings>>repositories> click them all and update
2007-06-01T16:45:00.000Z	clearzen	Tru7h	then sudo aptitude install ntfs-3g
2007-06-01T16:46:00.000Z	Tru7h		Clearzen: I don't see "settings"
2007-06-01T16:48:00.000Z	clearzen	Tru7h	sorry you have to go to Synaptic Package Manager first
2007-06-01T16:49:00.000Z	clearzen	Tru7h	then settings
