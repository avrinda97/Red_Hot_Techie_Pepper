2007-12-16T10:21:00.000Z	flamsmark		hey
2007-12-16T10:22:00.000Z	flamsmark		when i boot up a new install of ubuntu server 7.04, it hangs at "* Running local boot scripts (/etx/rc.local)     [OK]"
2007-12-16T10:23:00.000Z	nickrud	flamsmark	try hitting return at that screen, do you get a login?
2007-12-16T10:24:00.000Z	flamsmark	nickrud	can i install an x system on it?
2007-12-16T10:25:00.000Z	nickrud	flamsmark	yes, sudo aptitude install xserver-xorg <your favorite desktop>
2007-12-16T11:44:00.000Z	nickrud	flamsmark	does that even exist?
2007-12-16T11:45:00.000Z	nickrud	flamsmark	you'll need to change kernels, install linux-generic , that will install that package for -generic
2007-12-16T11:46:00.000Z	nickrud	flamsmark	doesn't exist here, the one for server
2007-12-16T11:47:00.000Z	nickrud	flamsmark	I'm running x64 , but I also checked on packages.ubuntu.com for certainty
2007-12-16T12:00:00.000Z	nickrud	flamsmark	try this:  https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/acpid/+bug/65635/comments/2
2007-12-16T12:03:00.000Z	nickrud	flamsmark	heh, probably not a bad choice. If you want a desktop, install a desktop :)
2007-12-16T12:05:00.000Z	nickrud	flamsmark	that what I have here. But it's primarily a desktop, so I installed it that way then added server functions as needed
2007-12-16T12:07:00.000Z	nickrud	flamsmark	sudo aptitude install apache2 php5 mysql-server-5.0  . Done :)
2007-12-16T12:07:00.000Z	flamsmark	nickrud	is there any point in installing the edubuntu/gobuntu/kubuntu/xubuntu desktop roles at install if i'm already asking for the ubuntu desktop one?
2007-12-16T12:08:00.000Z	flamsmark	nickrud	i'll bear that in mind next time
2007-12-16T12:08:00.000Z	nickrud	flamsmark	not really, the kubuntu and xubuntu variants have desktops that you might like, they take up space but live nicely together
2007-12-16T12:10:00.000Z	flamsmark	nickrud	assuming that i have an infinte hdd, is it more likely to save or make trouble down the road?
2007-12-16T12:11:00.000Z	nickrud	flamsmark	neither
2007-12-16T12:13:00.000Z	nickrud	flamsmark	xubuntu is really nice for slower machines, kubuntu is as functional as gnome/ubuntu, but a different philosophy. If you have the bandwidth and space, you should check it out (disclaimer, I don't like it)
2008-01-05T05:31:00.000Z	nickrud	flamsmark	look at /var/log/syslog , around the time you tried to hibernate there's probably a clue or two there
2008-01-05T05:32:00.000Z	flamsmark	nickrud	what would i be looking for?
2008-01-05T05:33:00.000Z	nickrud	flamsmark	for me, it told me my swap was too small. But look over the syslog, for hibernate
2008-01-05T05:34:00.000Z	nickrud	flamsmark	it'll probably be obvious, real near the switch from shutdown to startup
2008-01-05T06:29:00.000Z	flamsmark	nickrud	well, that didn't work
