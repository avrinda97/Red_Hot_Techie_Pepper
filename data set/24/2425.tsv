2008-12-24T13:17:00.000Z	IchigoMorino		Whenever I send or receive a message in Pidgin it freezes. It would seem that it is chilly outside and the carrier pidgins are too frozen to deliver anything.
2008-12-24T13:19:00.000Z	Grasputin	IchigoMorino	did you install any plugins and/or have you updated your system recently
2008-12-24T13:19:00.000Z	Grasputin	IchigoMorino	Kopete
2008-12-24T13:20:00.000Z	IchigoMorino	Grasputin	I just installed Ubuntu in a VM, it has worked on all other operating systems I have used it on. And stop trying to convert me please.
2008-12-24T13:21:00.000Z	Grasputin	IchigoMorino	I do tech support for a living man.... most people just want the simplest answer....
2008-12-24T13:22:00.000Z	IchigoMorino	Grasputin	If someone is asking how to fix a bruise on a pear; telling them to eat a banana instead isn't going to solve their problem.
2008-12-24T13:23:00.000Z	Grasputin	IchigoMorino	It does if they are really hungry
2008-12-24T13:24:00.000Z	IchigoMorino	Grasputin	The only plugin I have enabled is Nautilus Integration, which was enabled by default so I didn't touch it. I did mess with the settings, but not too much.
2008-12-24T13:25:00.000Z	Grasputin	IchigoMorino	Are you using multiple accounts currently? Sounds like ya are.
2008-12-24T13:26:00.000Z	IchigoMorino	Grasputin	I have AOL, WL, Google, and Yahoo! accounts.
2008-12-24T13:26:00.000Z	Grasputin	IchigoMorino	Ya might want to try disabling all accounts, signing into each one and if possible chat someone on each service up, to see what the response is like. Maybe one of the services is lagging and it's causing the whole program to slow down
2008-12-24T13:30:00.000Z	IchigoMorino	Grasputin	I just tried that. It happens with all four services. Whenever I send or receive a message the whole program freezes.
2008-12-24T13:32:00.000Z	Grasputin	IchigoMorino	Might try opening up Terminal and running pidgin from there.... send some messages and see if anything catches your eye there
2008-12-24T13:32:00.000Z	IchigoMorino	Grasputin	Does Pidgin print anything in the terminal?
2008-12-24T13:33:00.000Z	Grasputin	IchigoMorino	Lemme check a few things real quick like
2008-12-24T13:34:00.000Z	IchigoMorino	Grasputin	All it returns is "killed" when I force it to quit.
2008-12-24T13:35:00.000Z	Grasputin	IchigoMorino	you want to try `pidgin --debug` and prepare to see a screenfull
2008-12-24T13:37:00.000Z	IchigoMorino	Grasputin	"gstreamer: Failed to connect stream: Invalid argument"
2008-12-24T13:37:00.000Z	IchigoMorino	Grasputin	What does Pidgin use Gstreamer for?
2008-12-24T13:38:00.000Z	Grasputin	IchigoMorino	No idea man
2008-12-24T13:38:00.000Z	IchigoMorino	Grasputin	Well it makes sense, Ubuntu isn't picking up my VMs virtual soundcard.
2008-12-24T13:40:00.000Z	Grasputin	IchigoMorino	If it's spitting out a *LOT* of messages about sound related stuff, then I would recommend addressing the sound card to actually resolve the issue
2008-12-24T13:42:00.000Z	Grasputin	IchigoMorino	rww's got a point as well
2008-12-24T13:53:00.000Z	IchigoMorino	Grasputin	I changed the soundcard for the VM and Pidgin works now, along with my sound to. =3
