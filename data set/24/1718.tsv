2009-09-21T11:29:00.000Z	willca	iolion-need-soun	| so how is this not working, does it complain the hardware notfound or just no sound coming out?
2009-09-21T11:30:00.000Z	iolion-need-soun	willca	just no sound.. the h/w volume is up and so is the s/w
2009-09-21T11:30:00.000Z	willca	iolion-need-soun	| so in a terminal, alsamixer
2009-09-21T11:31:00.000Z	willca	iolion-need-soun	| the Master meter, do you see MM at the bottom?
2009-09-21T11:32:00.000Z	willca	iolion-need-soun	| k you see the meter right, then there is a small square at the base of that meter before the numbers and then word Master
2009-09-21T11:33:00.000Z	willca	iolion-need-soun	| press < and >
2009-09-21T11:34:00.000Z	iolion-need-soun	willca	all three master volume controls are red
2009-09-21T11:35:00.000Z	willca	iolion-need-soun	| does Card and Chip show the kind of soundcard you have?
2009-09-21T11:37:00.000Z	willca	iolion-need-soun	| if you keep pressing the right arrow key, do you see PCM and Speaker?
2009-09-21T11:38:00.000Z	willca	iolion-need-soun	| seems your card is recognized by ubuntu, just play around with alsamixer and test it with audacious or something to get some sound
2009-09-21T11:40:00.000Z	willca	iolion-need-soun	| alsamixer ?
2009-09-21T11:42:00.000Z	willca	iolion-need-soun	| just install alsaconf if its not there.. sudo apt-get install alsaconf
2009-09-21T11:45:00.000Z	willca	iolion-need-soun	| try reading up here...maybe it will help
2009-09-21T11:46:00.000Z	willca	iolion-need-soun	| Casper1 suggests you do this .... killall pulseaudio ; alsamixer -Dhw
