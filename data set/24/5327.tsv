2006-10-10T14:58:00.000Z	mnepton	whyme	are you really considering Ubuntu on an Old Wortld Mac?
2006-10-10T14:59:00.000Z	whyme	mnepton	what I'm considering, is that I don't want os9 on it.
2006-10-10T14:59:00.000Z	mnepton	whyme	NetBSD
2006-10-10T15:00:00.000Z	whyme	mnepton	any ideas about how I should go about it?
2006-10-10T15:00:00.000Z	mnepton	whyme	i work for Canonical. i probably know more about old Macs than anyone in the company besides Jim Troup. and i run NetBSD on my 68K. :)
2006-10-10T15:03:00.000Z	mnepton	whyme	what model Mac?
2006-10-10T15:04:00.000Z	mnepton	whyme	what's the point of keeping it alive at all?
2006-10-10T15:04:00.000Z	whyme	mnepton	sentimental reasons?
2006-10-10T15:04:00.000Z	mnepton	whyme	put it out to pasture and let it spend its last days eating canned pears and having some minimum wage orderly change its adult diapers.
2006-10-10T15:05:00.000Z	whyme	mnepton	bossman read your comments.
2006-10-10T15:07:00.000Z	mnepton	whyme	donate it to charity and take a $3K tax write-off ;)
2006-10-10T15:12:00.000Z	whyme	mnepton	it won't even boot off the os9.2 cd! holding down 'c' doesn't work... nor does the crazy arsed Command-Option-Shift-Delete
2006-10-10T15:13:00.000Z	mnepton	whyme	flash the PRAM. opt-cmd-p-r and let it chime 5 times.
2006-10-10T15:13:00.000Z	whyme	mnepton	and is that on boot?
2006-10-10T16:45:00.000Z	mnepton	whyme	why would you put images into a proprietary file format that one comapny controls?
2006-10-10T16:46:00.000Z	whyme	mnepton	yea, I put them there... right
2006-10-10T16:46:00.000Z	mnepton	whyme	well, you have proprietary file formats. welcome to the world of greedy, commercial software.
2006-10-10T16:46:00.000Z	whyme	mnepton	I didn't ask for the nrg file, I just got it.
2006-12-05T16:09:00.000Z	mnepton	whyme	because NM shuts itself down if it detects anything else has altered /etc/network/interfaces
