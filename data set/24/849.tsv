2010-12-22T13:39:00.000Z	User_Unfriendly	shawncm217	have you tried booting into the previous kernel?
2010-12-22T13:40:00.000Z	User_Unfriendly	shawncm217	reboot your system and after the bios screen hold down the shift key untill your booted into grub
2010-12-22T13:50:00.000Z	User_Unfriendly	shawncm217	what exactly is the problem from the update?
2010-12-22T13:56:00.000Z	User_Unfriendly	shawncm217	you running wireless?
2010-12-22T13:56:00.000Z	shawncm217	User_Unfriendly	No. Wired.
2010-12-22T13:59:00.000Z	User_Unfriendly	shawncm217	this happened from a update?
2010-12-22T14:01:00.000Z	shawncm217	User_Unfriendly	That's my guess. I got home. The Update Manager was prompting me to update. I hit Check to make sure I got all the latest. It went out to the internet and checked fine. I installed, restarted as requested and the network connection no longer worked.
2010-12-22T14:03:00.000Z	User_Unfriendly	shawncm217	you might have to see if a driver module for your network stoped working.  what info can you find when you type in:   sudo lshw?
2010-12-22T14:03:00.000Z	User_Unfriendly	shawncm217	sudo lshw    no question mard
2010-12-22T14:07:00.000Z	shawncm217	User_Unfriendly	It's a "RTL8111/8168B PCI Express Gigabit Ethernet controller"
2010-12-22T14:08:00.000Z	User_Unfriendly	shawncm217	is there a driver listed along in there with the controller?
2010-12-22T14:09:00.000Z	shawncm217	User_Unfriendly	driver=r8169 driver
2010-12-22T14:09:00.000Z	User_Unfriendly	shawncm217	so that is the driver that isn't working
2010-12-22T14:10:00.000Z	shawncm217	User_Unfriendly	Is there a way to rollback?
2010-12-22T14:21:00.000Z	shawncm217	User_Unfriendly	Is there a way to rollback that driver?
2010-12-22T14:22:00.000Z	User_Unfriendly	shawncm217	looking
2010-12-22T14:23:00.000Z	User_Unfriendly	shawncm217	it's best to know what the "update" updated
2010-12-22T14:24:00.000Z	User_Unfriendly	shawncm217	in /var/log/apt/     there's a bunch of history logs in there
2010-12-22T14:25:00.000Z	User_Unfriendly	shawncm217	      cat /var/log/apt/history.log
2010-12-22T14:28:00.000Z	shawncm217	User_Unfriendly	I've found the list of packages updated today. I don't see anything network specific.
2010-12-22T14:30:00.000Z	User_Unfriendly	shawncm217	i wonder if it's the configuration or is it driver related or both
2010-12-22T14:35:00.000Z	shawncm217	User_Unfriendly	I'm going to have to call it quits for tonight. Thanks for your help. At least we've eliminated a few possibilities.
