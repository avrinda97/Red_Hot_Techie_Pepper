2010-06-25T22:00:00.000Z	dominicdinada	wireshark	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SynapticHowto
2010-06-25T22:02:00.000Z	dominicdinada	wireshark	you can not have open more than one package manager at a time, while doing things. IE software center/synaptic/commandline
2010-06-25T22:02:00.000Z	wireshark	dominicdinada	 what i have to do now?
2010-06-25T22:02:00.000Z	dominicdinada	wireshark	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SynapticHowto  read here how to fix your problem
2010-06-25T22:02:00.000Z	dominicdinada	wireshark	make sure you are only using ONE of those at a time
2010-06-25T22:03:00.000Z	wireshark	dominicdinada	 the problem began when i installed the java
2010-06-25T22:03:00.000Z	dominicdinada	wireshark	well the obvious first step would be to remove it. reinstall it or other
2010-06-25T22:04:00.000Z	wireshark	dominicdinada	 i tried to remove it but i couldnt
2010-06-25T22:04:00.000Z	dominicdinada	wireshark	did you get any warnings on install that the browsers were open ?
2010-06-25T22:04:00.000Z	dominicdinada	wireshark	reinstall?
2010-06-25T22:04:00.000Z	wireshark	dominicdinada	 i try to open the synaptic
2010-06-25T22:05:00.000Z	dominicdinada	wireshark	this is the FOURTH time I have SAID, USE ONLY ONE AT A TIME
2010-06-25T22:06:00.000Z	dominicdinada	wireshark	well there is software center/aptitude or synaptic.... close all but one of those
2010-06-25T22:10:00.000Z	wireshark	dominicdinada	?
2010-06-25T22:10:00.000Z	dominicdinada	wireshark	STOP entering all these random commands
2010-06-25T22:11:00.000Z	dominicdinada	wireshark	there is more than one instance of package managers open fix that problem first
2010-06-25T22:12:00.000Z	wireshark	dominicdinada	 it says kill process? i accept it?
2010-06-25T22:12:00.000Z	dominicdinada	wireshark	I was not the person whom told you to PS | grep for dpkg but I would assume so
2010-06-25T22:12:00.000Z	dominicdinada	wireshark	then follow ActionParsnip's link
2010-06-25T22:14:00.000Z	dominicdinada	wireshark	first check your ps | grep for dpkg, then if only one instance is running try to force the install... if not follow ActionParsnips link to fix dpkg
2010-06-25T22:20:00.000Z	dominicdinada	wireshark	ActionParsnip  a simpler solution might just be to reboot? let the system fix the packages/unlockit
