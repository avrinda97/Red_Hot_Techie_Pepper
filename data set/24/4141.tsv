2007-07-03T09:47:00.000Z	Daverocks	Invisionfree	i haven't had experience with eggdrop, sorry :P
2007-07-03T09:48:00.000Z	Invisionfree	Daverocks	It's saying the file isn't there....Do I need to chmod that folder for any ./files?
2007-07-03T09:48:00.000Z	Daverocks	Invisionfree	which file?
2007-07-03T09:49:00.000Z	Invisionfree	Daverocks	./eggdrop -mn says eggdrop isn't even there
2007-07-03T09:50:00.000Z	Daverocks	Invisionfree	as i said, i don't have any experience with eggdrop so it's difficult for me to help you... try googling it
2007-07-03T09:51:00.000Z	Invisionfree	Daverocks	It is not EGGDROP that is giving me a file not found thing...It's gotta be something computer related...
2007-07-03T09:51:00.000Z	Daverocks	Invisionfree	ok, the binary eggdrop does not exist
2007-07-03T09:51:00.000Z	Daverocks	Invisionfree	have you checked using like "ls" that it's there? :P
2007-07-03T09:53:00.000Z	Daverocks	Invisionfree	is it executable?
2007-07-03T09:53:00.000Z	Daverocks	Invisionfree	do a "ls -l eggdrop"
2007-07-03T09:54:00.000Z	Invisionfree	Daverocks	-rwxr-xr-x 1 ishock ishock 679942 2007-06-28 16:34 eg
2007-07-03T09:54:00.000Z	Daverocks	Invisionfree	it's executable
2007-07-03T09:54:00.000Z	Daverocks	Invisionfree	but it's called "eg"?
2007-07-03T09:55:00.000Z	Invisionfree	Daverocks	I renamed it for my boredom
2007-07-03T09:55:00.000Z	Daverocks	Invisionfree	ok, that might affect things :P
2007-07-03T09:55:00.000Z	Invisionfree	Daverocks	I renamed it after it failed
2007-07-03T09:56:00.000Z	Daverocks	Invisionfree	hum.
2007-07-03T09:58:00.000Z	Invisionfree	Daverocks	It still fails to work..
2007-09-16T10:39:00.000Z	Daverocks	Invisionfree	what are its current permissions?
