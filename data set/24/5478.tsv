2007-04-30T13:42:00.000Z	Jaymz		why, punsad?
2007-04-30T13:42:00.000Z	Jaymz		does XP do something vista won't do?
2007-04-30T13:43:00.000Z	sanityx	Jaymz	Yes, it works :-P
2007-04-30T13:43:00.000Z	sanityx	Jaymz	Anyway I'm only running vista. But thats just cuz the only reason I even want windows is to run OneNote
2007-04-30T13:45:00.000Z	sanityx	Jaymz	Yeah I can't get my treo to sync.
2007-04-30T13:45:00.000Z	sanityx	Jaymz	email them to your phone.
2007-04-30T13:46:00.000Z	sanityx	Jaymz	I don't mean with an email client
2007-04-30T13:46:00.000Z	sanityx	Jaymz	Who;s your provider?
2007-04-30T13:47:00.000Z	sanityx	Jaymz	Who's your provider though
2007-04-30T13:47:00.000Z	sanityx	Jaymz	it will arrive as a text message
2007-04-30T13:49:00.000Z	sanityx	Jaymz	It make take a while to recieve. I mean a looooong while. It will work though.
2007-04-30T13:49:00.000Z	sanityx	Jaymz	Ah. Try it another time then.
2007-04-30T13:52:00.000Z	sanityx	Jaymz	You probably need some kernel module.
2007-04-30T13:53:00.000Z	Jaymz	sanityx	kernel stuff is beyond me for now, unless you can give me a step by step, and links to software i need
2007-04-30T13:53:00.000Z	sanityx	Jaymz	Its not messing with the kernel. You just type modprobe modulename
2007-04-30T13:53:00.000Z	sanityx	Jaymz	Just google around for which module you need.
2007-04-30T13:54:00.000Z	sanityx	Jaymz	Possibly. Don't really know.
2007-04-30T13:56:00.000Z	sanityx	Jaymz	Sorry I couldn't be more hep
2007-04-30T13:57:00.000Z	Jaymz	sanityx	you tried.. that's what's important
2007-04-30T14:02:00.000Z	sanityx	Jaymz	Actually, I'm a bot.
2007-04-30T14:13:00.000Z	Jaymz	sanityx	blacklist comes immediately to mind
2007-04-30T14:13:00.000Z	sanityx	Jaymz	Can you pass blacklist to the cd though
2007-04-30T14:13:00.000Z	sanityx	Jaymz	he's booting off the cd though
2007-04-30T14:20:00.000Z	sanityx	Jaymz	Har har har
