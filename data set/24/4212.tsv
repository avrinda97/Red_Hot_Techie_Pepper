2007-06-10T14:39:00.000Z	rinky		i have an ssh terminal open, and its behaving strangly, I get no characters appearing on screen when typing anymore, apart from when I hit enter, and it prints " >" (space forwardarrow) how could this happen?
2007-06-10T14:39:00.000Z	rinky		I entered a find command just before it messed up
2007-06-10T14:40:00.000Z	rinky		superq: a mere re-login fixed it, but I was curious as to what could cause it
2007-06-10T14:40:00.000Z	rinky		and I cannot type "reset" as no character keys respond
2007-06-10T14:41:00.000Z	rinky		ahh I see :)
2007-06-10T14:42:00.000Z	rinky		I try entering reset, and hitting enter on the dodgy terminal, it doesnt cause any changes
2007-06-10T14:43:00.000Z	rinky		ctrl-q and reset dont seem to have any effect
2007-06-10T14:44:00.000Z	SuperQ	rinky	just hit ctrl-c
2007-06-10T14:35:00.000Z	SuperQ	rinky	from a text terminal?
2007-06-10T14:35:00.000Z	rinky	SuperQ	yes, SSH login
2007-06-10T14:35:00.000Z	SuperQ	rinky	oh.. ssh login is different
2007-06-10T14:35:00.000Z	SuperQ	rinky	you have to ctrl-c
2007-06-10T14:35:00.000Z	SuperQ	rinky	and re-try your ssh command
2007-06-10T14:40:00.000Z	SuperQ	rinky	reset
2007-06-10T14:40:00.000Z	SuperQ	rinky	will reset the terminal emulation
2007-06-10T14:40:00.000Z	SuperQ	rinky	an explanation would require a long long history lesson about vt100
2007-06-10T14:41:00.000Z	SuperQ	rinky	basically, the echoing of your typing can be turned on and off (so you can enter passwords)
2007-06-10T14:42:00.000Z	SuperQ	rinky	reset will fix most terminal wackyness
2007-06-10T14:42:00.000Z	SuperQ	rinky	try hitting ctrl-q first
2007-06-10T14:43:00.000Z	SuperQ	rinky	hrm.. they should
2007-06-10T14:43:00.000Z	SuperQ	rinky	oh.. sorry.. >
2007-06-10T14:44:00.000Z	SuperQ	rinky	> is an indication of bash continuation
2007-06-10T14:44:00.000Z	SuperQ	rinky	so you can type things like:
2007-06-10T14:45:00.000Z	SuperQ	rinky	ctrl-c tells bash to abort command input
