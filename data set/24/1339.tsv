2010-04-18T01:55:00.000Z	peter_curry		I've been having problem with Clamtk Virus Scanner 4.15 (the GUI).  I've uninstalled and reinstalled it a couple of times.  But here is the problems I've been having with it off and on: won't update signatures (telling me updates failed), stalling at about 8% while scanning the entire file system (although scanning the home directory works fine), and I also need to know how to scan the entire file system using terminal
2010-04-18T01:55:00.000Z	peter_curry		commands.  First of all, would it be best to simply completely uninstall and reinstall Clamtk 4.15 with the best method possible?  Can anyone help me with these things?
2010-04-18T01:55:00.000Z	iceroot	peter_curry	why you are using the virus-scanner?
2010-04-18T01:56:00.000Z	peter_curry	iceroot	People say the Linux is pretty immune, but that does not mean that viruses do not still exist out there for Linux.  So I still run a virus scanner periodically.  It's just personal preference ...
2010-04-18T01:57:00.000Z	iceroot	peter_curry	you dont need a virus-scanner for linux
2010-04-18T02:04:00.000Z	peter_curry	iceroot	Thanks for article.  That is the most thorough explanation I have gotten so far.  The article still stated that "experimental" Linux viruse still exist, though.  There may come a day when someone geek learns Linux well enough to create virus with a reproduction rate greater than its death rate.  Yes, the chances of that today are slim, because of the simple fact that more people use Windows PCs.  So hackers and
2010-04-18T02:05:00.000Z	iceroot	peter_curry	just remove clamav, its useless on linux
2010-04-18T02:05:00.000Z	peter_curry	iceroot	OK - what are you thoughts behind that?  Why is it ineffective as a program?
2010-04-18T02:06:00.000Z	iceroot	peter_curry	because there is no need :)
2010-04-18T02:06:00.000Z	peter_curry	iceroot	yes, I am utilitarian myself.  Believe me.
2010-04-18T02:12:00.000Z	iceroot	peter_curry	with non-private we mean server-installations
2010-04-18T02:12:00.000Z	iceroot	peter_curry	even there you dont have to worry about viruses
2010-04-18T02:13:00.000Z	iceroot	peter_curry	you just need a virus-scanner if you are hosting a mail or samba-server with windows-client, for nothing else is clamav
2010-04-18T02:14:00.000Z	iceroot	peter_curry	as i said, only if there are windows-clients
2010-04-18T02:15:00.000Z	peter_curry	iceroot	yeah, I understand that now.  That's good stuff.
2010-04-18T02:15:00.000Z	iceroot	peter_curry	ikonia is an #ubuntu op, is that a good second opinion?
2010-04-18T02:16:00.000Z	peter_curry	iceroot	yes, I think that would be THE BEST second opinion !!!
2010-04-18T02:16:00.000Z	iceroot	peter_curry	after mine :)
2010-04-18T02:20:00.000Z	peter_curry	iceroot	yes, after yours :)  Being on this chat room kicks ass - because you encounter Linux users who really know what they are talking about.  Forget searching Google or other crap for solutions.  You just have to be patient with people responding to you with their messages.  And learn how to operate in this chat room efficiently, of course :)
2010-04-18T02:20:00.000Z	iceroot	peter_curry	that is how support is working
2010-04-18T02:22:00.000Z	peter_curry	iceroot	exactly.  It is better to have an OS support base of actual users - then constantly having to consult some customer service center.  That all becomes bullshit at some point ...
2010-04-18T02:22:00.000Z	iceroot	peter_curry	yes but watch your language :) and for just chatting, use #ubuntu-offtopic to keep this channel clean for support
2010-04-18T02:23:00.000Z	peter_curry	iceroot	 sorry, will do :)
2010-04-18T02:23:00.000Z	peter_curry	iceroot	yes, I would actually rather use the support chat room where the standard is cleaner language :)
