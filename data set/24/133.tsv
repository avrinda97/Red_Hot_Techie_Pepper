2012-05-20T23:45:00.000Z	manigma77_		Is there an easy way to get wifi going on ubuntu 12.04? I have the acer niplijy 802.11b/g/n card, but ubuntu doesn't recognize it. I tried to hook up my ethernet, but I couldn't get that to work either. Sorry, new to ubuntu.

2012-05-20T23:54:00.000Z	bennypr0fane		once, you've run it, post the results in the forum or pastebin them and ask someone in here to take a look at them. The script prints a very neat .txt file with results
