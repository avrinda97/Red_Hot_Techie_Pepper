2006-06-03T07:47:00.000Z	retry		I'm bashing my head against a wall with the Dlink DWL-650revP

2006-06-03T07:49:00.000Z	offby1	retry	although I dimly recall that there's more than one version of it
2006-06-03T07:49:00.000Z	retry		yeah that's the problem
2006-06-03T07:49:00.000Z	retry		I've been reading about the dlink 650 for the last two days
2006-06-03T07:49:00.000Z	retry		there are 4 revisions and all have different chipsets
2006-06-03T07:49:00.000Z	offby1	retry	I'm using Ubuntu precisely because it's the first distro i found which works with that card out of the box :-)
2006-06-03T07:49:00.000Z	retry		I still can't confirm what chipset mine has
2006-06-03T07:50:00.000Z	retry	offby1	yeah I hear that...for me wifi is the deal breaker with desktop linux
2006-06-03T07:50:00.000Z	retry		I can't be spending two days trying to debug pcmcia/cardbus issues
2006-06-03T07:51:00.000Z	offby1	retry	I can assure you this card was very cheap -- so even if your current card doesn't work, if you buy the other kind it probably will
2006-06-03T07:51:00.000Z	retry		the docs for that shit suck so much as it is
2006-06-03T07:51:00.000Z	retry		alright I'll look for it
2006-06-03T07:51:00.000Z	offby1		I don't even remember where I got it.
2006-06-03T07:51:00.000Z	offby1	retry	find some store that will let you return the card if it doesn't work.
2006-06-03T07:51:00.000Z	retry		oh yeah of course
2006-06-03T07:51:00.000Z	retry		I might just go buy one of every card
2006-06-03T07:51:00.000Z	retry		keep the one that works
2006-06-03T07:51:00.000Z	retry		return all the rest
2006-06-03T07:52:00.000Z	offby1	retry	if you can do that, that's great!
