2010-11-08T11:16:00.000Z	prtylghts		if i kill software center, it still runs when i re-open the software center. it doesn't change anything...
2010-11-08T11:17:00.000Z	prtylghts		yeah. its still stuck at 50%
2010-11-08T11:17:00.000Z	tecnico	prtylghts	did you try xkill like somebody suggested hours ago?
2010-11-08T11:17:00.000Z	prtylghts		yes i did. and again, all that did was kill the software center
2010-11-08T11:18:00.000Z	prtylghts		i dont have an actual window where i see it installing except software center
2010-11-08T11:19:00.000Z	tecnico	prtylghts	you can try a long shot like:   ps auxf |grep <part of package name>
2010-11-08T11:19:00.000Z	prtylghts		Well I am having other problems with amarok, which I was trying to fix by installing packages that it may need... and this was one of those packages.
2010-11-08T11:20:00.000Z	tecnico	prtylghts	if that returns something, get the number to the left (first column) and do "kill -HUP <numbeR>"  or if you feel adventurous try "kill -9 number"  ..@ your own risk
2010-11-08T11:20:00.000Z	tecnico		did u enable ssh rigved
2010-11-08T11:21:00.000Z	tecnico		apt-get install openssh-server
2010-11-08T11:21:00.000Z	tecnico		on both systems like bastid_raZor said
2010-11-08T11:21:00.000Z	prtylghts	tecnico	i did that and i have two different things, one is a process and one has a really long file-name... kill the process?
2010-11-08T11:22:00.000Z	tecnico	prtylghts	without knowing what the process / name / u r seeing on your screen.. it's hard to tell u
2010-11-08T11:23:00.000Z	prtylghts	tecnico	libqt4-sql-mysql .. it's a different package i guess
2010-11-08T11:23:00.000Z	prtylghts		wait no, that's the right one :
2010-11-08T11:24:00.000Z	tecnico	prtylghts	is that the package that you were trying to install?
2010-11-08T11:25:00.000Z	prtylghts	tecnico	yes
2010-11-08T11:25:00.000Z	tecnico		what does the last column on that line say prtylghts
2010-11-08T11:27:00.000Z	prtylghts		"21728 0.0 0.0 3324 784 pts/5 S+ 00:26 0:00 \_ grep libqt4-sql-mysql
2010-11-08T11:28:00.000Z	prtylghts		minus hte first "
2010-11-08T11:28:00.000Z	tecnico	prtylghts	that process corresponds to the grep itself of the command you are just now typying.. so that's not it
2010-11-08T11:29:00.000Z	prtylghts		haha. ok, well there is also a really long line above that
2010-11-08T11:29:00.000Z	prtylghts		running under root too .... PID?
2010-11-08T11:30:00.000Z	tecnico	prtylghts	you know that you could've rebooted a million times by now since you first asked about this... :)
