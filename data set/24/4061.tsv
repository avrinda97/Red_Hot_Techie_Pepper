2007-08-15T07:26:00.000Z	univremonster		kefka; no, but there's a deb available here:   http://www.getdeb.net/app.php?name=Pidgin
2007-08-15T07:26:00.000Z	univremonster		kefka; no prob.
2007-08-15T07:27:00.000Z	univremonster		does anyone know if you can install Wine or VMware without making a Windows partition?
2007-08-15T07:27:00.000Z	univremonster		I have the install DVD for XP
2007-08-15T07:27:00.000Z	univremonster		Theimon; are you writing to me?
2007-08-15T07:28:00.000Z	univremonster		Jack_sparrow:  Does VMplayer?  I have that installed, and a virtual machine downloaded
2007-08-15T07:28:00.000Z	Theimon	univremonster	vmware will ask how big the HDD must be and what type of OS you will be installing
2007-08-15T07:29:00.000Z	univremonster	Theimon	 i was going to do that but the VMware website said 64-bit Fiesty was not supported
2007-08-15T07:35:00.000Z	Theimon	univremonster	you cant use the install DVD because XP cant install another copy over itself
2007-08-15T07:35:00.000Z	univremonster	Theimon	 It wouldn't be over itself, i have no Windows partition
2007-08-15T07:35:00.000Z	univremonster	Theimon	 so I should try to run it without the DVD?
2007-08-15T07:36:00.000Z	Theimon	univremonster	the extension of the virtuall machine is probably vmdk
2007-08-15T07:37:00.000Z	univremonster	Theimon	 with the disk out I get the same errors... can I fix this by editing vmdk?
2007-08-15T07:38:00.000Z	Theimon	univremonster	you need to see the difference between player and workstation...
2007-08-15T07:41:00.000Z	Theimon	univremonster	?
2007-08-15T07:41:00.000Z	univremonster	Theimon	 I am in private chat with you
2007-08-15T07:41:00.000Z	univremonster	Theimon	 do you see it?
2007-08-15T07:42:00.000Z	univremonster	Theimon	 I have written to you and also see no response... maybe I am doing something wrong?  This has worked for me before..
2007-08-15T07:43:00.000Z	Theimon	univremonster	close that window
2007-08-15T07:44:00.000Z	univremonster	Theimon	nothin
2007-08-15T07:45:00.000Z	univremonster	Theimon	did you get it?
2007-08-15T07:47:00.000Z	Theimon	univremonster	i noticed the problem
2007-08-15T07:48:00.000Z	univremonster	Theimon	well that's very un-linuxy and restrictive
2007-08-15T07:49:00.000Z	univremonster	Theimon	 Join me in #ubuntu-classroom?
