2006-03-07T15:42:00.000Z	Kr4t05		How do I restart GDM?
2006-03-07T15:42:00.000Z	Kr4t05		Doesn't work.
2006-03-07T15:42:00.000Z	soundray	Kr4t05	sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart
2006-03-07T15:43:00.000Z	soundray	Kr4t05	that'll kill itself though, if you call it from X.
2006-03-08T17:06:00.000Z	soundray	Kr4t05	I do actually: it gives me nightmares ;)
2006-03-08T17:06:00.000Z	Kr4t05	soundray	I meant technical issues. :P
2006-03-08T17:07:00.000Z	soundray	Kr4t05	oh, those have all gone since I stopped playing it.
2006-03-08T17:07:00.000Z	soundray	Kr4t05	sorry, I'm not being very helpful here, I know.
2006-03-08T17:08:00.000Z	Kr4t05	soundray	Well, when I try to start it, I get a load of error messages in the terminal. You think you could help?
2006-03-08T17:09:00.000Z	soundray	Kr4t05	I may or I may not. Put them up on http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org in any case. Someone might know what to do.

2006-03-08T17:22:00.000Z	soundray	Kr4t05	have you got 3d acceleration?
2006-03-08T17:22:00.000Z	Kr4t05	soundray	As far as I knew.
2006-03-08T17:24:00.000Z	Kr4t05	soundray	jetsreamer: Let me try reinstalling my drivers.
2006-03-08T17:24:00.000Z	soundray	Kr4t05	good idea.
2006-03-08T17:43:00.000Z	Kr4t05	soundray	jetscreamer: Installing the drivers worked.
2006-03-08T08:40:00.000Z	soundray	Kr4t05	Twinview is a feature of Nvidia cards and drivers. Nothing to do with dapper.
2006-03-08T08:40:00.000Z	Kr4t05	soundray	Oh, yeah.
2006-03-10T17:02:00.000Z	soundray	Kr4t05	are you coming from MS Windows?
2006-03-10T17:02:00.000Z	Kr4t05	soundray	Kinda-sorta
2006-03-10T17:02:00.000Z	soundray	Kr4t05	icewm tries to be a bit similar and is small-footprint
2006-03-11T08:13:00.000Z	soundray	Kr4t05	sudo adduser username
2006-03-11T08:14:00.000Z	Kr4t05	soundray	Thanks, man
2006-03-11T08:20:00.000Z	soundray	Kr4t05	sudo adduser newuser admin
