2007-06-28T12:13:00.000Z	lgc	jrib	I know. It was just a reaction. Scroll back if you don't believe me.
2007-06-28T12:14:00.000Z	jrib	lgc	idc, call the ops if someone is offensive, don't respond like that
2010-05-29T07:47:00.000Z	jrib	lgc	are you running ubuntu in some virtualized environment?
2010-05-29T07:47:00.000Z	lgc	jrib	no.
2010-05-29T07:47:00.000Z	jrib	lgc	can you be more specific?  I don't see how that would be possible
2010-05-29T07:48:00.000Z	lgc	jrib	no, I am not running my ubuntu in a virtualized environment.
2010-05-29T07:48:00.000Z	jrib	lgc	I meant regarding the problem, but never mind, I misunderstood you anyway
2010-05-29T07:49:00.000Z	lgc	jrib	my session comes up with Evolution, for example, which I kill every time it shows up, only to do it again at the next boot.
2012-09-28T23:57:00.000Z	jrib	lgc	this channel is only for ubuntu support; not for free vpn services
2012-09-29T00:02:00.000Z	lgc	jrib	then would you be so kind as to help me set up my VPN service in Ubuntu?
2012-09-29T00:04:00.000Z	lgc	jrib	that is old. It doesn't cover 12.04.
2012-09-29T00:04:00.000Z	jrib	lgc	so is the statement for 10.04 no longer accurate?
2012-09-29T00:05:00.000Z	jrib	lgc	actually, just read the first 20 lines... that say "General intro"
2012-09-29T00:06:00.000Z	lgc	jrib	It's become much easier. It is included in the default install already. Only thing you actually need is pretty much server data.
2012-09-29T00:07:00.000Z	jrib	lgc	right, which is what the page says.  So what are you asking?
2012-09-29T00:08:00.000Z	jrib	lgc	server data?  What do you mean?  A vpn service you can use?
2012-09-29T00:08:00.000Z	lgc	jrib	exactly.
2012-09-29T00:08:00.000Z	jrib	lgc	that's not an ubuntu support question.  That's a question asking about free vpn services... I said this.
2012-09-29T00:09:00.000Z	lgc	jrib	bear in mind that I am asking a question about making a Ubuntu application work.
2012-09-29T00:10:00.000Z	jrib	lgc	no you're not.  You're asking for a free vpn.
2012-09-29T00:11:00.000Z	jrib	lgc	if you have a vpn server that you are trying to connect to and are having issues with that, then I misunderstood.  And you should ask again with that detail included
2012-09-29T00:13:00.000Z	lgc	jrib	does the word 'free' itch you? What's the point in not providing an answer to my request?
2012-09-29T00:15:00.000Z	jrib	lgc	this channel is for *ubuntu support* not (free or not free) vpn services.  So if you have a question about ubuntu support, please ask it.  Otherwise, you can try discussing for information about various vpn services in #ubuntu-offtopic for example
