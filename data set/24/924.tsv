2010-10-26T01:19:00.000Z	killerrr		hi!
2010-10-26T01:21:00.000Z	killerrr		Ubuntu 10.04 will never update some applications on some versions (except security updates) because they want to make the system stable. (For example vlc 1.0.6 will not update anymore). If i install Ubuntu 10.1 when will stop these updates ?
2010-10-26T01:23:00.000Z	dancek	killerrr	the idea of releases is to provide a certain combination of software (of certain versions)
2010-10-26T01:24:00.000Z	dancek	killerrr	if you want to stay up-to-date, update the whole distro each time ubuntu makes a release, or switch to a rolling-release distro
2010-10-26T01:25:00.000Z	killerrr		 dancek:  this is a little bit dangeous for system.
2010-10-26T01:25:00.000Z	killerrr		 dancek: i just need to updates all programs on stable versions..
2010-10-26T01:26:00.000Z	dancek	killerrr	you can't get both absolute stability and new versions of software
2010-10-26T01:27:00.000Z	dancek	killerrr	what are you using the system for anyway if you need it to be super-stable? ubuntu isn't meant for critical systems (imho)
2010-10-26T01:27:00.000Z	killerrr	dancek	hmm ok so i will use 10.04 and i will add repos on the softwares which i want to update...
2010-10-26T01:28:00.000Z	dancek	killerrr	i think you'll get a more stable system by upgrading to 10.10, then 11.04, then 11.10 etc
2010-10-26T01:29:00.000Z	killerrr	dancek	:( :( this is not good. now i don't trust to upgrade the system from releases to other one. and if i don't upgrade i have to install every program and every settings again... :( i don't wont to do this ever 6 months...
2010-10-26T01:31:00.000Z	killerrr	dancek	 anyway thank you! i have to leave now...
2010-10-26T01:31:00.000Z	dancek	killerrr	seriously ubuntu offers the option to upgrade, you don't lose anything. you just have to wait for apt to download new packages and install them. why not do the recommended thing?
2010-10-26T01:32:00.000Z	killerrr		 dancek: many users on forums faced problems when or after upgrade their ubuntu.
2010-10-26T01:33:00.000Z	dancek	killerrr	and many people die in traffic daily. so do you stay inside?
2010-10-26T01:33:00.000Z	dancek	killerrr	anyhow i think philosophy is offtopic so i wont continue :P
2010-10-26T01:34:00.000Z	killerrr		dancek:this is not the same thing. most of them not die. but on ubuntu dies :D
2010-10-26T01:35:00.000Z	dancek	killerrr	ok so how many percent of users have problems after upgrading? 0.5%?
2010-10-26T01:35:00.000Z	killerrr	dancek	i just need a stable system which is upgrading with all applications inside.. but not releasing. i will use 10.04 and i will update the 4-5 softwares which i want to update non-stop...
2010-10-26T01:36:00.000Z	killerrr	dancek	%0.05 ??? are you kidding me. i told you most of them... i read on forums every person who upgrade the system have problmes.. and always the other users say that please make a fresh install...
2010-10-26T01:36:00.000Z	killerrr	dancek	sorry i have to leave now. thank you for your interest...
2010-10-26T01:37:00.000Z	killerrr		dancek:can you just tell me before i go, my system will be stable if i update just 4-5 applications with adding repos ?
2010-10-26T01:39:00.000Z	dancek	killerrr	all upgrade problems are caused by some software. you'll be quite safe, but not completely
2010-10-26T01:39:00.000Z	killerrr	dancek	 ok. thank you again!
