2006-05-27T06:28:00.000Z	DMJC		cd doesn't even have the copy of gcc that was used to build the kernel
2006-05-27T06:28:00.000Z	DMJC		have to get into console change to vesa mode
2006-05-27T06:28:00.000Z	DMJC		just to get into the gui
2006-05-27T06:28:00.000Z	DMJC		it really pisses me off that distros don't just boot into vesa and offer a choice of gfx driver from there
2006-05-27T06:29:00.000Z	DMJC		much simpler
2006-05-27T06:29:00.000Z	DMJC		but seriously... gcc 4.0 but no gcc 3.3.4 which the kernel was built with?
2006-05-27T06:29:00.000Z	DMJC		the hell?
2006-05-27T06:29:00.000Z	DMJC		NV oss driver is a piece of crap
2006-05-27T06:29:00.000Z	DMJC		yes
2006-05-27T06:30:00.000Z	DMJC		nvidia-glx won't do much without nvidia.ko
2006-05-27T06:30:00.000Z	MrRio	DMJC	install nvidia-glx thru apt, don't bother getting it from nvidia.com
2006-05-27T06:30:00.000Z	DMJC		have to rebuild the kernel heh and there was even more BS when doing that lol
2006-05-27T06:30:00.000Z	DMJC	Opopanax	changing it to nvidia won't do anything if you can't build nvidia.ko
2006-05-27T06:31:00.000Z	DMJC		the driver module itself wouldn't compie.. heh
2006-05-27T06:31:00.000Z	DMJC		no net access
2006-05-27T06:31:00.000Z	DMJC		you'd think they could get the install cd right
2006-05-27T06:31:00.000Z	DMJC		the install cd only has gcc 4.0
2006-05-27T06:31:00.000Z	DMJC		ubuntu's kernel was built with gcc 3.3.4
2006-05-27T06:32:00.000Z	DMJC		and you need the same compiler version to build the kernel module
2006-05-27T06:32:00.000Z	DMJC		true amphi
2006-05-27T06:32:00.000Z	DMJC		but it'd be nice t at least get a booting distro
2006-05-27T06:32:00.000Z	DMJC		instead of a blue screen
2006-05-27T06:32:00.000Z	DMJC		nv driver doesn't work on 6600 gfx cards
2006-05-27T06:32:00.000Z	MrRio	DMJC	I've never had a blue screen with my nvidia cards before
