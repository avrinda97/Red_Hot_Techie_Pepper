2008-07-02T02:17:00.000Z	R2LM		Can someone point me to directions for using gfxboot?
2008-07-02T02:18:00.000Z	R2LM		Isn't there some sort of manual page for gfxboot?
2008-07-02T02:19:00.000Z	witriew	R2LM	not AFAIK
2008-07-02T02:19:00.000Z	witriew	R2LM	atleast, all it says is how to create a gfxboot.cfg
2008-07-02T02:25:00.000Z	witriew	R2LM	you need to make -C theme/gfx-ubuntu-theme and copy the new bootlogo over, i think
2008-07-02T02:26:00.000Z	witriew	R2LM	is this for isolinux or GRUB"
2008-07-02T02:27:00.000Z	R2LM	witriew	It's for Grub, and isn't the gfxboot-them-ubuntu package enough? Do I need to manually do a "make"?
2008-07-02T02:27:00.000Z	witriew	R2LM	you've looked at http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=208855 ?
2008-07-02T02:30:00.000Z	R2LM	witriew	Whew... 61 pages worth? :) I guess I could go through that, but I would need to look through most of the pages to find what might have changed for Hardy, since the original tutorial was posted via 2006.
2008-07-02T02:30:00.000Z	witriew	R2LM	i doubt anything would have changed for Hardy
2008-07-02T02:30:00.000Z	witriew	R2LM	the first post should help you about modifying what you need to
2008-07-02T02:31:00.000Z	witriew	R2LM	mainly, grub and gfxboot haven't changed much since 2006 :)
2008-07-02T02:32:00.000Z	R2LM	witriew	Fair enough, BTW have you used gfxboot? Did you follow that tutorial?
2008-07-02T02:33:00.000Z	witriew	R2LM	yeah, i've used it; in fact, i'm trying to get it working for iso/syslinux but there isn't much documentation about integrating with that
2008-07-02T02:33:00.000Z	witriew	R2LM	that's why i'm in here :)
2008-07-02T02:35:00.000Z	R2LM	witriew	Thanks for the help. And just out of curiosity, what do you mean by iso/syslinux? ISO files are usually CD images I thought--are you mounting a linux CD image or something?
2008-07-02T02:36:00.000Z	witriew	R2LM	iso/syslinux is a bootloader for cds, so that you can get a sort of selection screen
2008-07-02T02:36:00.000Z	witriew	R2LM	it also works over the network and on usb drivers, etc.
2008-07-02T02:37:00.000Z	R2LM	witriew	I thought I remember reading that Grub can be configured to boot a CD--have you checked that out?
2008-07-02T02:37:00.000Z	witriew	R2LM	you would need to configure isolinux to load grub, and then use grub to load isolinux
2008-07-02T02:37:00.000Z	witriew	R2LM	and that's far too convoluted since ubuntu/suse use isolinux+gfxboot without the grub
2008-07-02T02:38:00.000Z	R2LM	witriew	Gee the recursion makes my head spin. :) Good luck with finding a solution to your problem. :)
2008-07-02T02:38:00.000Z	witriew	R2LM	and the documentation for gfxboot isn't thorough enough to provide me with details on how construction of a gfxboot file works
2008-07-02T02:39:00.000Z	witriew	R2LM	thanks, i hope you find a solution to yours too
