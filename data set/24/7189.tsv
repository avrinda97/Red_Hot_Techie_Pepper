2005-10-27T15:28:00.000Z	Bieleke		how can i point my home to another linux-box that acts as server ?
2005-10-27T15:28:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	Bieleke	NFS
2005-10-27T15:28:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	Bieleke	For some reason NFS mounting is very slow in Ubuntu though.
2005-10-27T15:29:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	Bieleke	of course, it could just be that my server is running Fedora Core 3
2005-10-27T16:15:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	Bieleke	WTF, we already told you to use NFS.
2005-10-27T16:33:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	Bieleke	here's an NFS mount line I use:
2005-10-27T16:33:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	Bieleke	you definitely want to use 'auto' instead of 'noauto'
2005-10-27T16:34:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	Bieleke	server down = no home
2005-10-27T16:34:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	Bieleke	NFS will automatically wait for server to come back up for a while tho.
2005-10-27T16:34:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	Bieleke	if you have an unstasble server, DO NOT use it for /home.
2005-10-27T16:35:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	Bieleke	you might consider a distributed file system
2005-10-27T16:35:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	Bieleke	what is your end goal here anyway?
2005-10-27T16:36:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	Bieleke	look into a distributed file system or scheduled backups. Check out AMANDA.
2005-10-27T16:37:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	Bieleke	sounds like you just want assured backups.
2005-10-27T16:37:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	Bieleke	you don't have to store everything on the server for that
2005-10-27T16:38:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	Bieleke	so what. Try IMAP.
2005-10-27T16:38:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	Bieleke	google is your friend
2005-10-27T16:42:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	Bieleke	just create a separate /home partition.
2005-10-27T16:42:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	Bieleke	then you can nuke / re-install / change your distro whenever you want and not lose your user files.
2005-10-27T16:42:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	Bieleke	then, if you want to back that stuff up, just use dd and dump it to a compressed file.
2005-10-27T16:42:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	Bieleke	that's what I've done for years.
2005-10-27T16:44:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	Bieleke	if you want to get really tricky, use LVM and setup Home and System volume groups, then you can dynamically adjust the filesystem size.
2005-10-27T16:44:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	Bieleke	that's why you make backup copies onto the server. Don't rely 100% on your server because in that situation, the server HD is more likely to fail than the PCs.
2005-10-27T16:45:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	Bieleke	use separate /home partitions and scheduled backups or distributed filesystems. that's your best bet.
