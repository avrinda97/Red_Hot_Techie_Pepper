2006-04-23T08:51:00.000Z	swa		so I've installed libdvdcss2, yet I still can't play DVD's -- Totem tells me a proper decoder isn't installed.  any ideas?  I'm running amd64
2006-04-23T08:53:00.000Z	swa		also, somehow I've broken the auto-mounting of my DVD drive -- I have to manually "mount /media/cdrom0" and "umount /dev/scd0"
2006-04-23T08:54:00.000Z	swa		I have some lines to paste, can I paste them herE?  it's like 4 lines
2006-04-23T08:54:00.000Z	johanbr	swa	What's the exact message from totem?
2006-04-23T08:55:00.000Z	johanbr	swa	What does "ls -l /dev/scd0" say?
2006-04-23T08:56:00.000Z	johanbr	swa	Does your user belong to the cdrom group?
2006-04-23T08:57:00.000Z	swa	johanbr	 I was bad, and just for testing, ran VLC as root
2006-04-23T08:57:00.000Z	johanbr	swa	Ok. Do you have mplayer installed? If so, what does "mplayer dvd://1" say?
2006-04-23T09:01:00.000Z	johanbr	swa	I don't recognize that lib version. Where'd you get it from? I use Christian Marillat's version, and that works for me.
2006-04-23T09:02:00.000Z	swa	johanbr	 got it from ubuntulinux.nl
2006-04-23T09:02:00.000Z	johanbr	swa	And you're sure that /dev/scd0 is the correct device?
2006-04-23T09:03:00.000Z	swa	johanbr	 positive.  I only have one cdrom, it's an SATA DVD burner, and I can mount it perfectly
2006-04-23T09:07:00.000Z	johanbr	swa	You can try the dvdcss package from ftp://ftp.nerim.net/debian-marillat/pool/main/libd/libdvdcss/libdvdcss2_1.2.9-0.0_amd64.deb , maybe that'll work better.
2006-04-23T09:09:00.000Z	swa	johanbr	you're my hero!  That one is working!  mplayer can read my DVD perfectly now
2006-04-23T09:09:00.000Z	johanbr	swa	Great! Glad to be of help. :)
2006-04-23T09:13:00.000Z	johanbr	swa	Buggy kernel, most likely.
2006-04-23T09:18:00.000Z	johanbr	swa	Do you have cpufreqd or powernowd running?
2006-04-23T09:19:00.000Z	swa	johanbr	 powernowd is running
2006-04-23T09:20:00.000Z	swa	johanbr	 I stopped it, but the frequency did not change
2006-04-23T09:21:00.000Z	johanbr	swa	Sorry, I just realized that it may actually have been doing its job correctly. Can you start something cpu-intensive, like a compile, and see if the freq changes (after restarting powernowd) ?
2006-04-23T09:22:00.000Z	swa	johanbr	when I try to restart it, it fails -- do I need to reboot?
2006-04-23T09:22:00.000Z	johanbr	swa	That's strange. What happens if you run it straight from the commandline ("powernowd"). In any case, if you don't mind rebooting I guess that'd fix it.
2006-04-23T09:23:00.000Z	swa	johanbr	 rofl I'm silly, I was starting/stopping it as a normal user -- lemme sudo su - root and try again ;)
2006-04-23T09:24:00.000Z	johanbr	swa	Alright. :) It seems to be working then.
