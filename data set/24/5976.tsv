2011-05-20T11:41:00.000Z	Ileden	XVampireX	I'm using 1001px, but with xubuntu 10.10. I've enconuntered some very weird wlan problems.
2011-05-20T11:42:00.000Z	XVampireX	Ileden	?
2011-05-20T11:43:00.000Z	Ileden	XVampireX	I'm typing here :)
2011-05-20T11:43:00.000Z	Ileden	XVampireX	not really. About 30% of times, I can't connect to my home network with "authentication fail" or somesuch. However, works with every other network, and every other computer works with my home wlan.
2011-05-20T11:44:00.000Z	Ileden	XVampireX	also, it works like a charm on window 7 dualboot side...
2011-05-20T11:44:00.000Z	Ileden	XVampireX	One thing you might want to try is use ndiswrapper to use windows side wlan drivers on linux. However, didn't help for me.
2011-05-20T11:46:00.000Z	Ileden	XVampireX	Also, the ath9k driver (or, well, "kernel module" may be the correct term) has some parameters you can try messing around with to see if there's a difference.
2011-05-20T11:47:00.000Z	Ileden	XVampireX	ath9k is the driver linux, well at least 10.10, uses for the 1001px wlan card.
2011-05-20T11:53:00.000Z	XVampireX	Ileden	how do I know the parameters?
2011-05-20T11:54:00.000Z	Ileden	XVampireX	I wish I knew if there was one :) Let me check the parameters, I have the old notes from when I tried to troubleshoot the wlan isuue.
2011-05-20T11:57:00.000Z	Ileden	XVampireX	modinfo ath9k shows the parameters available. actually there weren't that many, it seems only "debug" and "nohwcrypt"
2011-05-20T12:15:00.000Z	XVampireX	Ileden	looks like we're not the only ones having this problem
2011-05-20T12:16:00.000Z	Ileden	XVampireX	yeah. I've given up on it myself, when I can't connect to home net, I'll just use GPRS via my phone. :)
2011-05-20T12:17:00.000Z	Ileden	XVampireX	I've had my headphones work ok.
2011-05-20T12:17:00.000Z	Ileden	XVampireX	though I'm using mostly bluetooth headphones, so I haven't tested extensively.
2011-05-20T12:20:00.000Z	Ileden	XVampireX	but that's not a problem if you start to expect them to be where unity has them. I mean that goes away once you get used to it?
2011-05-20T12:21:00.000Z	XVampireX	Ileden	I've used Windows a lot, and I'm on linux/ubuntu now since 6.04 or so
2011-05-20T12:22:00.000Z	XVampireX	Ileden	probably some tab auto completion
2011-05-20T12:24:00.000Z	Ileden	XVampireX	I'm not arguing unity is good. I haven't tried it much yet. But I don't like to stick to old models only because of familiarity. THat's only me, of course.
2011-05-20T12:27:00.000Z	Ileden	XVampireX	did you try using the win driver via ndiswrapper btw? Any luck with that?
2011-05-20T12:29:00.000Z	Ileden	XVampireX	iirc I used the ones that came with windows.
2011-05-20T12:33:00.000Z	Ileden	XVampireX	there's a external program to generate steps automatically. something that had "monkey" in its name :D
2011-05-20T12:33:00.000Z	Ileden	XVampireX	works pretty nice too. Nothing dramatic of course, but I've had fun with it.
2011-05-20T12:35:00.000Z	Ileden	XVampireX	"Dancing Monkeys". Open source, but apparently provided compiled only for windows.
