2008-03-21T09:47:00.000Z	darkscript		no
2008-03-21T09:47:00.000Z	darkscript		dont write the stuff in the brack3ets Yowshi
2008-03-21T09:48:00.000Z	darkscript		just use ps -A to find the name of firefox binaries and killall the name what you had Yowshi
2008-03-21T09:49:00.000Z	darkscript		hmm
2008-03-21T09:51:00.000Z	darkscript		zaider depends on the file
2008-03-21T09:53:00.000Z	darkscript		you mean chown -R 777 / Zaider
2008-03-21T09:55:00.000Z	darkscript		is chmod -R 777 / but... i still would not recommend that Zaider
2008-03-21T09:57:00.000Z	darkscript		he asked ubotu.. it does not screw you over
2008-03-21T09:57:00.000Z	darkscript		i warned him too
2008-03-21T09:57:00.000Z	Flannel	darkscript	That doesn't mean you should tell him.  Protect people from their ignorance.  They don't know how Linux works, and don't understand how it's different.  Educate, instead of completely breaking.
2008-03-21T09:59:00.000Z	Flannel	darkscript	No, its not just behind a firewall issue.  Some important things WILL NOT work like that.
2008-03-21T09:59:00.000Z	Flannel	darkscript	Lets take it to #ubuntu-offtopic, since it's offtopic
2008-03-30T11:13:00.000Z	Flannel	darkscript	did you do something in lokkit to disable them?
2008-03-30T11:13:00.000Z	Flannel	darkscript	You don't need to "enable" ports.  You juts need to have something listen to them.
2008-03-30T11:14:00.000Z	Flannel	darkscript	Not unless you've added something.
2008-03-30T11:15:00.000Z	Flannel	darkscript	By default, all you need to do to get apache or ssh listening is just install it (and then it starts).
2008-03-30T11:15:00.000Z	Flannel	darkscript	what does `sudo iptables -L` give you?
2008-03-30T11:16:00.000Z	Flannel	darkscript	lokkit, I believe, is just a GUI to iptables.  Is there any reason you're not using firestarter, by the way?
2008-03-30T11:17:00.000Z	Flannel	darkscript	lokkit is a GUI, isn't it?
2008-03-30T11:17:00.000Z	Flannel	darkscript	Ah, alright.  Well, the iptables command will let us see what damage its done
2008-03-30T11:21:00.000Z	darkscript	Flannel	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/61567
2008-03-30T11:24:00.000Z	Flannel	darkscript	Actually, try this: `sudo iptables -F`  this will just remove everything, and we can verify that it works sans rules.
2008-03-30T11:24:00.000Z	Flannel	darkscript	and you can start over with your lokkit stuff.
2008-03-30T11:27:00.000Z	Flannel	darkscript	alright, well, I'm not familiar with lokkit, so I'm unsure whats going on there.  You'll have to find someone who is, or at least who's more familiar with it than I am.
