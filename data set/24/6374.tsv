2005-10-27T16:00:00.000Z	Seveas	Elsan	how much memory do you have?
2005-10-27T16:01:00.000Z	Elsan	Seveas	512 Mb, I'm gonna need to upgrade soon for a new game; it worked well on my other computer iwht less memory a year ago with Fedore
2005-10-27T16:01:00.000Z	Seveas	Elsan	you need at least 512mb swap
2005-10-27T16:02:00.000Z	Elsan	Seveas	Damn, I thought it was gonna be okay with 380 mb like the install said
2005-10-27T16:02:00.000Z	Elsan	Seveas	Can I add swap with the normal install?
2005-10-27T16:02:00.000Z	Seveas	Elsan	yes
2005-10-27T16:03:00.000Z	Elsan	Seveas	If I upgrade my memory later, I figure it would need more swap?
2005-10-27T16:03:00.000Z	Seveas	Elsan	no, the more memory, the less swap :)
2005-10-27T16:04:00.000Z	Elsan	Seveas	Seveas: So right now, I neeed 512? I won'T need to change if I upgrade my RAM to 1Gb?
2005-10-27T16:04:00.000Z	Seveas	Elsan	I always suggest to keep ram+swap at around a gigabyte unless you do heavy A/V editing
2005-10-27T16:05:00.000Z	Elsan	Seveas	I see, so, I can take 1Gb off my Windows partition and add it to swap without any problems with the cd install?
2005-10-27T16:06:00.000Z	Seveas	Elsan	you have no swap at all now?
2005-10-27T16:06:00.000Z	Elsan	Seveas	380 mb like the install told me, I had freed some space withj PArtition Magic before(which doesn't work anymore for some reason)
2005-10-27T16:07:00.000Z	Seveas	Elsan	cat /proc/swaps
2005-10-27T16:07:00.000Z	Seveas	Elsan	cat /proc/meminfo
2005-10-27T16:07:00.000Z	Elsan	Seveas	I want to know if I can safely remove space from my Win partiton, I don't want to reformat again, I did it lots of time before
2005-10-27T16:07:00.000Z	Seveas	Elsan	partition magic seems to be good at that
2005-10-27T16:08:00.000Z	Elsan	Seveas	It tells me it can't find drive number and I can't start it anymore since I installed Ubuntu.; Yes, resize with the Ubuntu partman CD utility
2005-10-27T16:10:00.000Z	Elsan	Seveas	Is it safe to resize NTFS with partman?
2005-10-27T16:10:00.000Z	Seveas	Elsan	no idea, never tried....
2005-10-27T16:11:00.000Z	Elsan	Seveas	:/ Thanks anyway for the rest of the help!
2005-10-27T08:15:00.000Z	Elsan	Seveas	Are you there?
