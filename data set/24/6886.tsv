2005-06-22T13:02:00.000Z	sk2		ok then, I guess I'll look for another distribution
2005-06-22T13:03:00.000Z	sk2		that's tolerable
2005-06-22T13:03:00.000Z	sk2		windows 98 runs alright, I have a friend running win2k on a lower specced laptop
2005-06-22T13:03:00.000Z	sk2		In the forums they talk about http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=39060&highlight=low+ram
2005-06-22T13:05:00.000Z	sk2		In the installer it says "You must have at least 24 MB of RAM to use this installer", but in that forum post http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=39060&highlight=low+ram they mention 32 mb, for the same problem as what I have
2005-06-22T13:06:00.000Z	sk2		I have the same problem as that guy, he was also running it on a laptop with 32mb of ram
2005-06-22T13:07:00.000Z	sk2		ok
2005-06-22T13:07:00.000Z	sk2		Toshiba 470CDT
2005-06-22T13:09:00.000Z	sk2		I have 2gb of hard disk, so perhaps I could set up swap somehow to extend the ram during install? (couldn't find anything in the forums on how to do this though)
2005-06-22T13:11:00.000Z	rideout	sk2	can you debootstap the hard dist from another comp with more ram and only install the things you need?
2005-06-22T13:12:00.000Z	sk2	rideout	do what?
2005-06-22T13:13:00.000Z	sk2	rideout	sorry closed window
2005-06-22T13:14:00.000Z	rideout	sk2	well, if you can access the hd from another computer, you can run http://packages.ubuntu.com/hoary/admin/debootstrap
2005-06-22T13:14:00.000Z	rideout	sk2	basically is facilates a chroot install
2005-06-22T13:14:00.000Z	rideout	sk2	chroot *net install
2005-06-22T13:17:00.000Z	rideout	sk2	(sorry i missed the begining of your thread) that is one way, or also you can run it off a live-cd on your laptop. it doesn't have the memory overhead of the full installer, and only does a base system, but if your cool with apt it should be enough
2005-06-22T13:17:00.000Z	sk2	rideout	I'm only really used to gentoo packages
2005-06-22T13:19:00.000Z	rideout	sk2	well, when you log in after the install, a run "$ apt-get install kde" and kde will be installed (or gnome if you change the command)
2005-06-22T13:20:00.000Z	rideout	sk2	apt-get install fluxbox !!
2005-06-22T13:21:00.000Z	rideout	sk2	that was the point, debootstap is another installer for ubuntu withought the memory overhead
2005-06-22T13:22:00.000Z	rideout	sk2	i think so
2005-06-22T13:22:00.000Z	sk2	rideout	what livecd do you reccomend?
2005-06-22T13:26:00.000Z	sk2	rideout	what livecd shoudl i use to bootstrap from?
