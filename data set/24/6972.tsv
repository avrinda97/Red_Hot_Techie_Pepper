2005-06-30T05:09:00.000Z	Curlydave		hey online somoeme posted how to reinstall the system or something liek that
2005-06-30T05:09:00.000Z	Curlydave		but it needs su
2005-06-30T05:09:00.000Z	Curlydave		and su tells me "sorry, authentication failed"
2005-06-30T05:09:00.000Z	Curlydave		what's up with that?
2005-06-30T05:09:00.000Z	Curlydave		does anyone know how to use su?
2005-06-30T05:10:00.000Z	jasoncohen	Curlydave	ubuntu uses sudo
2005-06-30T05:10:00.000Z	jasoncohen	Curlydave	"reinstall the system or something like that"?
2005-06-30T05:10:00.000Z	Curlydave	jasoncohen	i was told for what i'm doing it's too hardcare for sudo and i need su
2005-06-30T05:11:00.000Z	jasoncohen	Curlydave	wait a second
2005-06-30T05:11:00.000Z	jasoncohen	Curlydave	before using some random command- how exactly doesn't gnome work and what command are you using to fix it?
2005-06-30T05:12:00.000Z	jasoncohen	Curlydave	one of the ideas of having a root user or using sudo is to make you think before using a command. so what are you trying to do?
2005-06-30T05:12:00.000Z	Curlydave	jasoncohen	my bro said he rebooted his comp, and now all he gets when booting into gnome is a mouse cursor on a brown background
2005-06-30T05:12:00.000Z	Curlydave	jasoncohen	i just want gnome working, and i don't know what i'm trying to do
2005-06-30T05:15:00.000Z	jasoncohen	Curlydave	then follow the directions that guy gave you to create a root account
2005-06-30T05:15:00.000Z	jasoncohen	Curlydave	i don't see why you can't do it with sudo
2005-06-30T05:24:00.000Z	Curlydave	jasoncohen	i got root working
2005-06-30T05:24:00.000Z	Curlydave	jasoncohen	but now it's pulling the whole bullshit error,  run apt-get update to fix it
2005-06-30T05:25:00.000Z	jasoncohen	Curlydave	you shoudl apt-get update
2005-06-30T05:26:00.000Z	Curlydave	jasoncohen	i did apt-get update, like it said
2005-06-30T05:26:00.000Z	Curlydave	jasoncohen	that did alot of things
2005-06-30T05:26:00.000Z	Curlydave	jasoncohen	however, fixing the problem was not one of them. it still did it again
2005-06-30T05:28:00.000Z	jasoncohen	Curlydave	what exactly is the error?
2005-06-30T05:38:00.000Z	Curlydave	jasoncohen	oh, no error
2005-06-30T05:38:00.000Z	Curlydave	jasoncohen	just nothign mroe than a mouse cursor, unless i do failsafe terminal, in which case i get a terminal in teh corna
