2009-01-17T04:11:00.000Z	jinja-sheep	jedi06	 What is it that you're trying to do?

2009-01-17T04:13:00.000Z	jinja-sheep	jedi06	-- You use virtualbox or virtualbox-ose ?
2009-01-17T04:13:00.000Z	jedi06	jinja-sheep	well i don't pay for it so its probably ose
2009-01-17T04:29:00.000Z	jinja-sheep	jedi06	I'm back.  Sorry.  Got a company.
2009-01-17T04:30:00.000Z	jinja-sheep	jedi06	You're trying to share a folder between two machines?
2009-01-17T04:30:00.000Z	jedi06	jinja-sheep	well it is the same machine but they think they are different
2009-01-17T04:31:00.000Z	jinja-sheep	jedi06	You're trying to create a folder (on linux) that your Windows (on VirtualBox) can access to... ?
2009-01-17T04:32:00.000Z	jedi06	jinja-sheep	i created the folder in windows that i will need to save stuff to from linux
2009-01-17T04:32:00.000Z	jinja-sheep	jedi06	What are you running?  And what is VirtualBox running?  (Host/Guest0.
2009-01-17T04:34:00.000Z	jinja-sheep	jedi06	Okay.  My situation is opposite.  I think it is similar.  First, you set up.  On VirtualBox, do you see (Devices --> Shared Folders -->)?  Set that to point to your folder.
2009-01-17T04:36:00.000Z	jinja-sheep	jedi06	Turn off the sharing feature on the folder.
2009-01-17T04:36:00.000Z	jedi06	jinja-sheep	that seems counter productive
2009-01-17T04:37:00.000Z	jinja-sheep	jedi06	Not if you're running both OS on a same machine.
2009-01-17T04:37:00.000Z	jedi06	jinja-sheep	they think they are on different don't they ok so what do I do after that
2009-01-17T04:38:00.000Z	jinja-sheep	jedi06	Let me find a link that can explain everything for you.
2009-01-17T04:40:00.000Z	jedi06	jinja-sheep	that would great
2009-01-17T04:41:00.000Z	jinja-sheep	jedi06	Meanwhile, try your luck in #vbox
2009-01-17T04:43:00.000Z	jedi06	jinja-sheep	i have

2009-01-17T04:51:00.000Z	jedi06	jinja-sheep	i cannot install guest additions from livecd
2009-01-17T04:52:00.000Z	jinja-sheep	jedi06	You can download the guest addition from the website and place it in the correct directory.
