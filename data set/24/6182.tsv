2006-03-10T17:46:00.000Z	blazemonger		for compiling anything i might come across
2006-03-10T17:48:00.000Z	ompaul	blazemonger	5.10 has the compiler just install >>sudo apt-get install build-essential<< that will give you what you need
2006-03-10T17:49:00.000Z	blazemonger	ompaul	:obviously it didnt because it wont even compile svgalib
2006-03-10T17:50:00.000Z	ompaul	blazemonger	compiling is not for the feint hearted
2006-04-21T15:41:00.000Z	ompaul	blazemonger	as Jordan Hubbard used to say, you seem to have the most interest in solving this problem, why not give it a shot :)
2006-04-21T15:41:00.000Z	ompaul	blazemonger	and the shot was not an intended pun :)
2007-02-15T13:22:00.000Z	ompaul	blazemonger	funny there are a few million who don't get mad at it
2007-02-15T13:23:00.000Z	ompaul	blazemonger	well if you think code is bad, you are entitled to not just say it is bad but yoiu can also submit a suggested fix
2007-02-15T13:23:00.000Z	ompaul	blazemonger	I found that screen saver issues was more to do with video cards that were not behaving themselves
2007-02-15T13:25:00.000Z	ompaul	blazemonger	if something does not work then why insist on trying it out, like either fix it or move on,
2007-02-15T13:25:00.000Z	ompaul	blazemonger	so what video card have you got?
2007-02-15T13:26:00.000Z	ompaul	blazemonger	and what driver are you using?
2007-02-15T13:26:00.000Z	ompaul	blazemonger	change it to vesa
2007-02-15T13:28:00.000Z	ompaul	blazemonger	choices choices choices you know what is faulty don't know what is wrong, but can take out my initial suggestion to make it work?
2007-02-15T13:28:00.000Z	ompaul	blazemonger	that is just the debian driver from sid
2007-02-15T13:29:00.000Z	blazemonger	ompaul	well i was using debian sid and the molecule saver didnt crash
2007-02-15T13:29:00.000Z	ompaul	blazemonger	be nice
2007-02-15T13:39:00.000Z	ompaul	blazemonger	kindly keep the conversation in a chat room this is a support channel and not for vista
2007-02-15T13:39:00.000Z	blazemonger	ompaul	ok...sorry
