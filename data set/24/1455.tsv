2010-01-09T02:47:00.000Z	Losha	erUSUL	that's ok. My ukrainian is crap, but my fdisk is fluent....
2010-01-26T04:19:00.000Z	Losha	erUSUL	I still have a serial modem. I even used it once, about 6 months ago, when comcast shut me off by mistake. I even made them pay for a month's subscription to a dial-up service...
2010-01-26T04:19:00.000Z	erUSUL	Losha	:) i stand corrected then XD my dial up modem is usb still in a box somewhere
2010-01-26T04:21:00.000Z	Losha	erUSUL	some ofthe more rural parts of the US still only have dialup, apparently. We hear from them here on IRC from time to time....

2010-03-22T23:55:00.000Z	Losha	erUSUL	how do you get those fancy brackets?
2010-03-22T23:55:00.000Z	erUSUL	Losha	AltGr + z or x ;)
2010-03-22T23:55:00.000Z	Losha	erUSUL	thanks...
2010-03-23T22:37:00.000Z	Losha	erUSUL	wow, didn't know you spoke Spanish...
2010-03-23T22:38:00.000Z	erUSUL	Losha	i'm spanish
2010-03-23T22:38:00.000Z	Losha	erUSUL	I didn't know. Isn't cono a naughty word for a schoolboy?
2010-03-23T22:39:00.000Z	erUSUL	Losha	well is a naughty word but not uncommon in schoolboys; sadly
2010-03-23T22:42:00.000Z	erUSUL	Losha	ActionParsnip a bug has been open against the distro they are using and they are going to fix it really soon; or so they said
2010-03-23T22:43:00.000Z	Losha	erUSUL	that's good there's a bug open. I just thought it might satisfy everyone involved to autoforward them to the 'spanish schoolkids channel'...
2010-04-24T01:58:00.000Z	Losha	erUSUL	the problem is hidden carriage returns in the script file (as from a dos machine). Why bash doesn't ignore them god alone knows...
2010-04-24T02:00:00.000Z	Losha	erUSUL	my script basically did the same thing:  tr -d '\r' < original_scriptfile > newfile
2010-04-24T02:04:00.000Z	Losha	erUSUL	I prefer my version. Yours will strip out the last char on a line if accidentally run on a non-dos file...
2010-04-24T02:07:00.000Z	Losha	erUSUL	stubborn :-)
2010-04-24T02:08:00.000Z	erUSUL	Losha	for the sake of completeness :)
2010-04-24T02:40:00.000Z	erUSUL	Losha	hay i'm spanish myself. so ...
2010-04-24T02:41:00.000Z	Losha	erUSUL	spanish and a Dune fan?
2010-04-24T02:41:00.000Z	erUSUL	Losha	true :)
