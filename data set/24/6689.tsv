2005-08-22T08:54:00.000Z	garyc		I want to share a folder with windows machines on my network can anyone help
2005-08-22T08:55:00.000Z	bimberi	garyc	system -> administration -> shared folders (install samba if required)
2005-08-22T08:58:00.000Z	bimberi	garyc	so you did "sudo  smbpasswd -a <username>"
2005-08-22T09:00:00.000Z	garyc	bimberi	how do I do that
2005-08-22T09:00:00.000Z	bimberi	garyc	in a terminal window
2005-08-22T09:02:00.000Z	garyc	bimberi	traffic too much for me is there a way to talk one on one
2005-08-22T09:02:00.000Z	bimberi	garyc	sure - "/query bimberi" in your irc client
2005-10-30T15:54:00.000Z	garyc	bimberi	was that my answer
2005-10-30T15:54:00.000Z	garyc	bimberi	buy the way, is it possible to upgrade 5.04 to 5.1 without reloading
2005-10-30T15:55:00.000Z	bimberi	garyc	possibly, but i don't know what you mean by reloading. reinstalling?
2005-10-30T15:56:00.000Z	bimberi	garyc	you don't have to reinstall, but you must reload repositories as part of the process
2005-10-30T15:57:00.000Z	garyc	bimberi	yes I just reinstalled with a full wipe and re-partition today and I am back up to speed
2005-10-30T15:57:00.000Z	bimberi	garyc	k :)
2005-10-30T15:57:00.000Z	garyc	bimberi	thought I might have done it wrong -  that the upgrade is better
2005-10-30T15:58:00.000Z	bimberi	garyc	not at all, if a clean install is possible it's usually the best option :)
2005-10-30T15:58:00.000Z	garyc	bimberi	wotnarg said upgrade is flaky
2005-10-30T15:59:00.000Z	bimberi	garyc	i can only agree - i've had some problems myself
2005-10-30T15:59:00.000Z	garyc	bimberi	It took about 2 hours to get back to full speed on the complete re-install
2005-10-30T16:00:00.000Z	bimberi	garyc	definitely a good option for you then :)
2005-10-30T16:00:00.000Z	garyc	bimberi	bummer though - my cdrw still wont burn - do you remember me working on that?
2005-10-30T16:02:00.000Z	garyc	bimberi	cyberdrive cw068d reads fine but wont burn
2005-10-30T16:02:00.000Z	bimberi	garyc	yeah, i don't have anything startlingly new for you though :/
