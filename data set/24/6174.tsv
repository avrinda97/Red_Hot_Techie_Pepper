2005-12-24T08:03:00.000Z	kurt_		Quick question... I've downloaded what has seemed to be 300 different ubuntu iso's. All of them have md5 mismatches on various debs (most often the linux kernel.) -- I've tried two cd burners, and I cannot figure out why the md5 mismatches are happening. Is this a common problem?
2005-12-24T08:03:00.000Z	kurt_		I've tried multiple mirrors, and even the dvd iso bittorrent has this problem.
2005-12-24T08:04:00.000Z	Crackez	kurt_	no it is not
2005-12-24T08:04:00.000Z	kurt_		well Crackez : I have no clue why this is happening.
2005-12-24T08:04:00.000Z	Crackez	kurt_	what are you downloading with?
2005-12-24T08:04:00.000Z	kurt_		firefox.
2005-12-24T08:05:00.000Z	Crackez		hmm, i've never had a problem with firefox, what about your network connection, is it flakey?
2005-12-24T08:05:00.000Z	kurt_		nope.
2005-12-24T08:05:00.000Z	kurt_		I've downloaded debian iso's and such and all of them pass the checks.
2005-12-24T08:05:00.000Z	Crackez	kurt_	the smae thing happened to me once, and it was my nic
2005-12-24T08:05:00.000Z	kurt_		it's a nvnet nic.
2005-12-24T08:06:00.000Z	Crackez		actually that whole machine died... ah memories
2005-12-24T08:06:00.000Z	kurt_		I don't know if that'd be it, though.
2005-12-24T08:06:00.000Z	Crackez		well, maybe not, thats just how it was for me
2005-12-24T08:06:00.000Z	kurt_		Because I've burnt other iso's of other distrobutions to check... and even recently downloaded iso's passed without md5 mismatches.
2005-12-24T08:07:00.000Z	Crackez		do you have a unix machine elsewhere that you could do the download from?
2005-12-24T08:07:00.000Z	kurt_		Yes. This one.
2005-12-24T08:07:00.000Z	kurt_		let me try that out
2005-12-24T08:07:00.000Z	Crackez		perhaps your isp has a flakey router...
2005-12-24T08:08:00.000Z	kurt_		it would suck if it's that. I was planning to set up a gigabit network, and I don't want to buy more nics
2005-12-24T08:08:00.000Z	kurt_		heh
2005-12-24T08:11:00.000Z	Crackez		i wish i had gigabit, i still have a cisco 3640 with only 10mbit interfaces
2005-12-24T08:12:00.000Z	Crackez		it routes between my wifi and the rest of my lan
2005-12-24T08:12:00.000Z	kurt_	Crackez	the box I'm on right now is just up for storage / such. Soon it'll become my router, so heh. I'll be doing fine shortly. (-- Stupid d-link router currently.)
