2008-09-28T12:50:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Daps	"lsusb"  and the but you want is something like this: "ID 05ca:1836"
2008-09-28T12:51:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Daps	thanks, give me amo
2008-09-28T12:52:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Daps	you need the gspca driver
2008-09-28T12:53:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Daps	Try this - if you get a report, the driver is installed: modinfo gspca | grep -i '046d.*08da'
2008-09-28T12:53:00.000Z	Daps	IntuitiveNipple	i've downloaded that driver, but i don't know how to run it
2008-09-28T12:53:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Daps	you don't 'run' it. Do you mean build it?
2008-09-28T12:55:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Daps	Install it from my PPA - I maintain a whole bunch of web-cam drivers in DKMS packages to make it easy
2008-09-28T12:55:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Daps	https://edge.launchpad.net/~intuitivenipple/+archive?field.name_filter=gspca&field.status_filter=published
2008-09-28T13:01:00.000Z	Daps	IntuitiveNipple	i got this pop up: /tmp/gspca-dkms_01.00.20-1ubuntu2~ppa2h.tar.gz could not be opened, because the associated helper application does not exist. Change the association in your preferences.
2008-09-28T13:02:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Daps	You're not supposed to download it :) Here, follow these instructions to add my repository: http://tjworld.net/wiki/Linux/Ubuntu/Packages/MyPPA
2008-09-28T13:03:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Daps	Then do "sudo apt-get install gspca-dkms"
2008-09-28T13:03:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Daps	after that, remove my repository
