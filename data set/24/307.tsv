2011-12-09T09:45:00.000Z	somsip	ovhan	where is it displayed?

2011-12-09T09:46:00.000Z	somsip	ovhan	bash commands all take parameters. You need to change the output of date to do what you want. type "man date"
2011-12-09T09:48:00.000Z	somsip	ovhan	that will lead you onto alias. This would be where you set an alias of "date" to actually run "date -s "my date format string" so it works transparently
2011-12-09T09:57:00.000Z	somsip	ovhan	I know it's quiet in here right now, but it is a support channel rather than a chat channel. Feel free to take chat to #ubuntu-offtopic
