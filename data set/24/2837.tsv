2008-09-21T20:36:00.000Z	Dr_Link		OK, so I accidentally set my resolution to the lowest setting (320 by 125 if I remember correctly) while trying to set it up (I blame the mouse wheel). How do I set it back?
2008-09-21T20:37:00.000Z	Dr_Link		The screen resolution is so bad I can't even see the System menu.
2008-09-21T20:37:00.000Z	Dr_Link		So what exactly do I do?
2008-09-21T20:38:00.000Z	Dr_Link		Am I being ignored due to "lack of common sense" or does anyone know how to set my screen resolution without going to the System menu?
2008-09-21T20:39:00.000Z	Dr_Link		I don't have access to a terminal, guys.
2008-09-21T20:39:00.000Z	Dr_Link		For the third time, I can't see the menus.
2008-09-21T20:41:00.000Z	Dr_Link		I ran displayconfig but I can't see the the dropdown for the resolution setting because the res is so small. How annoying, legend2440. Is there a file I can edit to set the resolution?
2008-09-21T20:42:00.000Z	smokewon	Dr_Link	what video card do you have (ATi or Nvidia?)
2008-09-21T20:42:00.000Z	Dr_Link		I believe it's an NVIDIA.
2008-09-21T20:43:00.000Z	smokewon	Dr_Link	google for this query "Envy-NG + Ubuntu"
2008-09-21T20:43:00.000Z	smokewon		and once you find it
2008-09-21T20:43:00.000Z	smokewon		install it
2008-09-21T20:43:00.000Z	smokewon		its a piece of software that will install the Nvidia drivers for you
2008-09-21T20:43:00.000Z	smokewon		very simple to use
2008-09-21T20:43:00.000Z	smokewon		and should fix your reso problems
2008-09-21T20:45:00.000Z	Dr_Link		Since I can't do anything due to a low resolution, I'll edit the file from a LiveCD and then reboot.
2008-09-21T20:45:00.000Z	smokewon	Dr_Link	i wouldnt if i were you
2008-09-21T20:45:00.000Z	smokewon		unless your experienced linux user

2008-09-21T20:45:00.000Z	Dr_Link	smokewon	I already have the nVidia drivers. Nothing like that. I just accidentally set the screen res too low.
2008-09-21T20:45:00.000Z	smokewon		trust me, try Envy-NG
