2008-01-13T11:32:00.000Z	bkar		kauer-> open office have a jdbc interface to connect to most databases
2008-01-13T11:34:00.000Z	kauer	bkar	Thanks, yes I've tried JDBC and ODBc with OpenOffice and given up. It is either obtuse beyond all reckoning, or broken. Also, JDBC/ODBC are connectors - you still need an application above them. That's what I'm after - some kind of relatively simple application builder for simple (*simple*) DB apps.
2008-01-13T11:34:00.000Z	bkar	kauer	well what do you want your app to do really? you seem to be looking for an app as opposed to jdbc connectivity to the db ?
2008-01-13T11:36:00.000Z	bkar		asian you may take a look at " dpkg dump "
2008-01-13T11:39:00.000Z	kauer	bkar	yes, I am looking for an application builder. I want some way to easily (preferably via a GUI) construct simple DB applications (read/write/edit/report stuff). Ideally the app builder itself would use (say) JDBC or ODBC rather than be DB-specific.
2008-01-13T11:40:00.000Z	bkar		anyone have a multiple OS boot system in different hard disk and partitions? may you tell me how many entries your result of  "find /boot/grub/stage1 "  from boot>  command line?
2008-01-13T11:41:00.000Z	bkar		kauer-> i had no problem using open office jdbc connectors, again why not write your own sql queries and have a ball with the results?
2008-01-13T11:41:00.000Z	kauer	bkar	really? What OS, what version of OO? I got nowhere.
2008-01-13T11:42:00.000Z	kauer	bkar	To be specific, OO kept bailing out (crashing).
2008-01-13T11:42:00.000Z	bkar	kauer	well i have not been using database recently, but as far back as suse 7.1
2008-01-13T11:42:00.000Z	bkar		kauer-> crashing in what ways? what were you doing when it was crashing?
2008-01-13T11:44:00.000Z	bkar		anyone have a multiple OS boot system in different hard disk and partitions? may you tell me how many entries is your result of  "find /boot/grub/stage1 "  from boot>  command line?
2008-01-13T11:46:00.000Z	bkar		anyone with multiple os boots? please as sudo root;  and in the grub> command line please find  /boot/grub/stage1 and tell me how many entries you have?
2008-01-13T11:47:00.000Z	bkar		danloz-> installed ? how did you install it? a deb package?
2008-01-13T11:47:00.000Z	kauer	bkar	It's a while ago now. As far as I recall, the test connection would work, but any attempt to actually touch the database would cause a crash. What versions are you using? I'm on feisty with OO 2.2.0.
2008-01-13T11:48:00.000Z	bkar	kauer	am switching back n forth between dapper and gutsy but i have not run databases on these..only on suse
2008-01-13T11:48:00.000Z	kauer	bkar	If you haven't been using the database recently then....
2008-01-13T11:49:00.000Z	bkar	kauer	what crashes? the database or your whole system?
2008-01-13T11:50:00.000Z	bkar		no one at all have multiple boot that can assist me? just need to find out how many entries
2008-01-13T11:59:00.000Z	kauer	bkar	Just OO crashes. Sudden death.
2008-01-13T12:00:00.000Z	bkar	kauer	oh well, i dont know if you have the right jdbc jars to connect...jars for specific db ..
2008-01-13T12:03:00.000Z	bkar		anyone with multiple os boots? please as sudo root;  and in the grub> command line please find  /boot/grub/stage1 and tell me how many entries you have?
2008-01-13T12:04:00.000Z	kauer		 bkar: yup, made very sure they were the right ones. Also got exactly the same symptoms attempting to connect to mysql, postgresql and oracle (with different connectors of course!).  As far as I am concerned, OO+DB is broken. So, back to my origibal question: Do you know of any DB app builders?
2008-01-13T12:06:00.000Z	bkar	kauer	nope
