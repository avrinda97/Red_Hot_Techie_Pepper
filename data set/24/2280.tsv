2009-07-12T16:22:00.000Z	mzz	jrib	no, it's what I said to do. Sorry about that :)
2009-07-12T16:23:00.000Z	jrib	mzz	that's a good guess
2009-07-12T16:26:00.000Z	mzz	jrib	if that's it I really don't understand why the keybinding editor still sees the key
2009-07-15T15:20:00.000Z	jrib	mzz	what?
2009-07-15T15:21:00.000Z	mzz	jrib	trying to accomplish the equivalent of a gentoo "world file": a list of everything I've explicitly installed. Unfortunately it looks like the entire base system was explicitly installed, so I'm throwing out all "explicitly installed" marks and starting over
2009-07-15T15:22:00.000Z	jrib	mzz	erm, ok.  Why don't you just subtract all of the dependencies of ubuntu-desktop from your list?
2009-07-15T15:22:00.000Z	mzz	jrib	why is that easier and how do I do it?
2009-07-15T15:23:00.000Z	jrib	mzz	apt will probably tell you you don't need stuff because you didn't explicitly install it when you actually do need it; don't know offhand
2009-07-15T15:23:00.000Z	mzz	jrib	basically if deborphan -a actually worked I'd use that, but it seems to get "Recommends" and "Suggests" mixed up
2009-07-15T15:24:00.000Z	mzz	jrib	so it misses things like mercurial which I explicitly installed) which has a dependency loop with mercurial-common
2009-07-15T15:24:00.000Z	jrib	mzz	does apt-get autoremove not work?
2009-07-15T15:25:00.000Z	jrib	mzz	never mind, you have a different purpose right?
2009-07-15T15:25:00.000Z	mzz	jrib	I want a list of its roots, basically.
2009-07-15T15:25:00.000Z	mzz	jrib	unfortunately deborphan does not seem to use the same criteria autoremove uses.
2009-07-15T15:25:00.000Z	jrib	mzz	ok, I can think of one way to get the list: from a pristine new install
2009-07-15T15:26:00.000Z	mzz	jrib	I'm just doing it the other way around now: mark everything auto-installed, then mark stuff manually installed until autoremove doesn't want to remove anything.
2009-07-15T15:26:00.000Z	mzz	jrib	shouldn't be too hard.
2009-07-15T15:26:00.000Z	jrib	mzz	nope, not too hard, but backup what you change at least in case I am correct about my warning above
2009-07-15T15:26:00.000Z	mzz	jrib	which one?
2009-07-15T15:27:00.000Z	jrib	mzz	apt will probably tell you you don't need stuff because you didn't explicitly install it when you actually do need it; don't know offhand
2009-07-15T15:27:00.000Z	mzz	jrib	I'll sanitycheck its decisions, don't worry. And even if I screw up: this is a scratch install.
2009-07-15T15:28:00.000Z	jrib	mzz	out of curiousity what purpose does this serve?
2009-07-15T15:28:00.000Z	mzz	jrib	I want a list of stuff I've manually installed for easier maintenance (both so I can install the same stuff on other systems and so I know what to remove to reclaim disk space)
2009-07-15T16:11:00.000Z	mzz	jrib	heh, good point, I should've checked for that
