2007-04-20T07:34:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ		hey, on Feisty my VLC player keeps freezing and crashing the gdm back to the login screen... any ideas?
2007-04-20T07:34:00.000Z	delire	PresuntoRJ	yikes, that's no good. does it happen also with Totem?
2007-04-20T07:35:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	delire	toten seems ok, but I do prefer VLC
2007-04-20T07:35:00.000Z	delire	PresuntoRJ	i understand.. perhaps it's a problem with the VLC package on Feisty? where did you aquire it from?
2007-04-20T07:36:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	delire	what is even odder, apport wont even notice the crash.
2007-04-20T07:36:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	delire	add/remove (the same from aptitude or apt-get)
2007-04-20T07:37:00.000Z	delire	PresuntoRJ	right, ok. which architecture?
2007-04-20T07:37:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	delire	it got to be related to a later upgrade on the beta, cause it used to work on early betas... not sure exactaly what the version I had a couple of weeks ago

2007-04-20T07:38:00.000Z	delire	PresuntoRJ	sounds like a bug in VLC to me, perhaps a memory leak or similar. if i were you i'd register a bug.
2007-04-20T07:38:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	delire	if only apport set the response according to the issue, it would be realy helpful
2007-04-20T07:39:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	delire	what kind of attachements would you recomend? lspci -vv? /var/daemon.log? dmesg?
2007-04-20T07:39:00.000Z	delire	PresuntoRJ	yes, this is very odd.. it seems the crash is happening before hand, sudden-death style
2007-04-20T07:39:00.000Z	delire	PresuntoRJ	dmesg and ~/.xsession-errors and also a gdm log file if found.
2007-04-20T07:39:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	delire	as soon as I press PLAY with any video format (Ubuntu codecs) WMV, AVI, MPG...
2007-04-20T07:39:00.000Z	delire	PresuntoRJ	also detail the file you're attempting to play and your architecture.
2007-04-20T07:40:00.000Z	delire	PresuntoRJ	sounds like a serious enough problem to warrant a very useful bug report..
2007-04-20T07:40:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	delire	I'll look into it asap and post yet another issue on lauchpad ;)
2007-04-20T07:40:00.000Z	delire	PresuntoRJ	good for you. this is how Ubuntu improves.
2007-04-20T07:41:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	delire	and feisty is impressively better than the ones before... imagine where it could go
2007-04-20T07:41:00.000Z	delire	PresuntoRJ	yes, it's a pretty landmark release i think..
2007-04-20T07:43:00.000Z	delire	PresuntoRJ	HasratUSA has a point. i have had problems with the proprietary ATI drivers (fglrx) and video in the past.. though a long time ago now. include information about your driver in the bug report.
2007-04-20T07:51:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	delire	sorry, what point? I was collecting information for the bug report
2007-04-20T07:52:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	delire	i have missed the other comment
