2007-01-15T16:44:00.000Z	aninhumer		Has anyone been able to get S-Video out working with an intel card?
2007-01-15T16:46:00.000Z	aninhumer		Is there a cheap way of getting SCART tv-out from a VGA pot?
2007-01-15T16:47:00.000Z	adaptr	aninhumer	solder on a SCART connector; SCART has the same component wires that VGA has
2007-01-15T16:48:00.000Z	aninhumer	adaptr	do I need to do anything with the xorg?
2007-01-15T16:48:00.000Z	adaptr	aninhumer	why ? you're still using the same output
2007-01-15T16:49:00.000Z	aninhumer	adaptr	I read something about TVs using a lower refresh rates,
2007-01-15T16:49:00.000Z	adaptr	aninhumer	they do, that's what a TV out is for
2007-01-15T16:51:00.000Z	aninhumer	adaptr	So if I make (or more likely buy) a VGA to SCART cable, it will work without any setting changes?
2007-01-15T16:52:00.000Z	adaptr	aninhumer	that depends.. I would google for the signals first, as you don't want to blow up your video card doing that...
2007-01-15T16:52:00.000Z	adaptr	aninhumer	a thorough google should tell you if and how it is possible
2007-01-15T16:53:00.000Z	aninhumer	adaptr	thx
2007-01-15T16:53:00.000Z	adaptr	aninhumer	what card doesn't have tv out these days ? it must be old.. you can probably get a similar card with tv out for around $30
2007-01-15T16:54:00.000Z	aninhumer	adaptr	it's a laptop, and it has tv-out but I've had no luck getting that to work
2007-01-15T16:54:00.000Z	adaptr	aninhumer	ah... so you need to be able to use the laptop's function keys ? there is software for that
2007-01-15T16:54:00.000Z	aninhumer	adaptr	ah
2007-01-15T16:55:00.000Z	adaptr	aninhumer	it will depend in large part on the type of laptop, though
2007-01-15T16:55:00.000Z	aninhumer	adaptr	toshiba satellite
2007-01-15T16:55:00.000Z	adaptr	aninhumer	hmm.. should work I think
2007-01-15T16:56:00.000Z	aninhumer	adaptr	what software do I need?
2007-01-15T16:57:00.000Z	adaptr	aninhumer	I'm trying to remember what it's called... hmmm .. synaptic.. no, that's for the touchy-feely pad
2007-01-15T16:58:00.000Z	aninhumer	adaptr	I think I've found it thx (sry for being n00b)
2007-01-15T16:59:00.000Z	adaptr	aninhumer	yes ? so what was it called again ? (more people might want to know)
2007-01-15T16:59:00.000Z	aninhumer	adaptr	"fnfxd" is a package for toshiba laptops
2007-01-15T16:59:00.000Z	adaptr	aninhumer	ah.. not the one I was thinking of, but there you go, then :)
