2007-07-12T06:34:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey		Hey can anyone help me to set amaroK to do something when I put in a CD?
2007-07-12T06:35:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey		I don't think that itunes works in wine because its dependent on quick time
2007-07-12T06:35:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey		How do I set amarok to play a CD when I insert a CD into my optical drive? I tried replacing sound-juicer with amarok in the removeable drives/media thing, but that didn't work
2007-07-12T06:36:00.000Z	astro76	d4rkmonkey	you'll probably have better luck asking in #kubuntu
2007-07-12T06:36:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	astro76	I'm using gnome though...
2007-07-12T06:37:00.000Z	astro76	d4rkmonkey	amarok is kde and they probably all use it ;)
2007-07-12T06:37:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	astro76	won't set up change though between gnome and KDE?
2007-07-12T06:37:00.000Z	astro76	d4rkmonkey	you probably need to find the right command line options to pass to amarok
2007-07-12T06:37:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	astro76	yeah I was basically asking if anyone knew... I guess I'm gonna go for google then :)
2007-08-26T06:58:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	astro76	ok, thanks
2007-08-26T06:57:00.000Z	astro76	d4rkmonkey	do ls Music/*/*/.* first to test
2007-08-26T06:57:00.000Z	astro76	d4rkmonkey	or use rm -i
2007-08-26T06:58:00.000Z	astro76	d4rkmonkey	asks for confirmation for every file
2007-08-26T07:06:00.000Z	astro76	d4rkmonkey	where did you add it, gnome sessions?
2007-08-26T07:07:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	astro76	I guess, if thats the sessions option in system>preferences
2007-08-26T07:07:00.000Z	astro76	d4rkmonkey	yeah, hmm that's strange
2007-08-26T07:08:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	astro76	is there a way to make it start absolutely last or something?
2007-08-26T07:08:00.000Z	astro76	d4rkmonkey	I don't think you can specify order, but your tray should be up by that point
2007-08-26T07:09:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	astro76	yeah, its weird, especially since it works perfectly fine when I start it up on my own after
2007-08-26T07:38:00.000Z	astro76	d4rkmonkey	I have a command for you
2007-08-26T07:39:00.000Z	astro76	d4rkmonkey	find ./ -type f -name '.*' -delete
2007-08-26T07:40:00.000Z	astro76	d4rkmonkey	or replace ./ with whatever the base directory is
2007-08-26T07:40:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	astro76	ok, I'll try that
2007-08-26T15:36:00.000Z	astro76	d4rkmonkey	probably c++ (and out of those only php is a language :) )
