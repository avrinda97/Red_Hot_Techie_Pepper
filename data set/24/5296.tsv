2006-11-11T16:30:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	aSt3raL_	panics ?
2006-11-11T16:31:00.000Z	aSt3raL_	Kingsqueak	what?
2006-11-11T16:31:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	aSt3raL_	try 'noapic' on the boot options
2006-11-11T16:31:00.000Z	aSt3raL_	Kingsqueak	its the install cd
2006-11-11T16:31:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	aSt3raL_	oh, hmm didn't have any trouble here, amd X2
2006-11-11T16:32:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	aSt3raL_	what actually happens, how far do you get?
2006-11-11T16:32:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	aSt3raL_	do you know GRUB at all?
2006-11-11T16:33:00.000Z	aSt3raL_	Kingsqueak	yeah a little why?
2006-11-11T16:33:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	aSt3raL_	actually no the install doesn't show it to you, on the installer it allows you to pass boot options, add 'noapic' to it
2006-11-11T16:33:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	aSt3raL_	 boot: install noapic    try that
2006-11-11T16:36:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	aSt3raL_	did you try 'noapic' ?
2006-11-11T16:36:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	aSt3raL_	give that a shot, mine won't boot after install without that set now
2006-11-11T16:36:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	aSt3raL_	I think it installed without it, but the installed kernels need it passed
2006-11-11T16:37:00.000Z	aSt3raL_	Kingsqueak	thanks i dont have to reinstall now
2006-11-11T16:38:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	aSt3raL_	cool
2006-11-11T16:38:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	aSt3raL_	don't forget to put that in /boot/grub/menu.lst
2006-11-11T16:38:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	aSt3raL_	another quick tip, just download firefox and put it in your home dir and run it from there...32bit
2006-11-11T16:38:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	aSt3raL_	it will work better with plugins
2006-11-11T16:39:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	aSt3raL_	honestly, I keep meaning to look it up
2006-11-11T16:39:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	aSt3raL_	yeah, plugins don't much like 64bit yet
2006-11-11T16:39:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	aSt3raL_	I've got most working now just by running 32bit Firefox2
2006-11-11T16:41:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	aSt3raL_	seems it is an interrupt control thing
