2008-04-30T04:59:00.000Z	Kevin`	jrib	so there's no way to make it work?
2008-04-30T04:59:00.000Z	jrib	Kevin`	what do you mean?  I gave you the link about vmware.   Do you have a specific question other than "help with vmware?"
2008-04-30T05:00:00.000Z	Kevin`	jrib	yeah.. let me find it in my backlog
2008-04-30T05:00:00.000Z	Kevin`	jrib	http://pastebin.ca/1002399 - what do I have to do to get vmware  working on ubuntu 8.x?
2008-04-30T05:01:00.000Z	jrib	Kevin`	how did you install it?
2008-04-30T05:01:00.000Z	Kevin`	jrib	tar
2008-04-30T05:02:00.000Z	jrib	Kevin`	did the wiki page ubottu send not help?
2008-04-30T05:03:00.000Z	Kevin`	jrib	ubottu just said "not for hardy"
2008-04-30T05:03:00.000Z	jrib	Kevin`	didn't he give you a link to a wiki page?
2008-04-30T05:05:00.000Z	Kevin`	jrib	the page doesn't have any instructions for 8.x
2008-04-30T05:06:00.000Z	jrib	Kevin`	which instructions are not applicable to 8.04?
2008-04-30T05:08:00.000Z	Kevin`	jrib	it specifically says which versions the different parts of the instructions apply to
2008-04-30T05:10:00.000Z	jrib	Kevin`	yes, I understand.  You need to read them and discern if they are applicble to 8.04.  Which vmware product are you installing exactly?
2008-04-30T05:10:00.000Z	Kevin`	jrib	just the vmware server console
2008-04-30T05:10:00.000Z	jrib	Kevin`	did it install successfully from the tar.gz?
2008-04-30T05:11:00.000Z	Kevin`	jrib	yes, but it doesn't run properly
2008-04-30T05:15:00.000Z	jrib	Kevin`	see: http://communities.vmware.com/message/399695
2008-04-30T05:17:00.000Z	jrib	Kevin`	http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=217650 has a suggestion as well
2008-04-30T05:18:00.000Z	jrib	Kevin`	ok, last link for you: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=772757 :)
2008-04-30T05:19:00.000Z	Kevin`	jrib	thanks, removing usr/lib/vmware-server-console/lib/libgcc_s.so.1/libgcc_s.so.1 made it work
