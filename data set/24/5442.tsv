2006-10-08T13:10:00.000Z	SeraVitae		could anyone suggest an email server for linux that i could use? i wish to setup an IMAP system so i can get my pop3 emails stored on my home server so i can browse them at uni
2006-10-08T13:11:00.000Z	SeraVitae		actually i'd like some fancy web interface one that had a calendar and stuff in it, but fat chance.
2006-10-08T13:11:00.000Z	holycow	SeraVitae	you will need a couple of servers working together.  a great smtp server is postfix, an a great imap server is cyrus.
2006-10-08T13:12:00.000Z	SeraVitae	holycow	- are they hard to setup?
2006-10-08T13:12:00.000Z	holycow	SeraVitae	yes
2006-10-08T13:12:00.000Z	holycow	SeraVitae	why don't you just download the free version of zimbra
