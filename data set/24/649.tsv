2011-04-16T21:59:00.000Z	Hoxx_		can someone help, I tried to install ubunto on flash drive and now it wont boot into windows?
2011-04-16T22:00:00.000Z	kyubutsu	Hoxx_	 you said it wont boot without the usb drive plugged in, thats different
2011-04-16T22:01:00.000Z	Hoxx_	kyubutsu	I dont know why it messed with the c drive when I clearly set it to only install on the usb stick
2011-04-16T22:02:00.000Z	kyubutsu	Hoxx_	sounds like you need fix the mbr [reinstall windows bootloader]
2011-04-16T22:02:00.000Z	Hoxx_	kyubutsu	with the USB stick it boots into windows perfectly and also ubuntu if I choose it
2011-04-16T22:03:00.000Z	Hoxx_	kyubutsu	If I remove the stick it says "cannot find grub" or something like that
2011-04-16T22:03:00.000Z	kyubutsu	Hoxx_	but .. ?
2011-04-16T22:05:00.000Z	Hoxx_	kyubutsu	I dont know, if I r-install windwos, will it work again? or will it keep booting to grub
2011-04-16T22:05:00.000Z	Hoxx_	kyubutsu	the problem is brub
2011-04-16T22:06:00.000Z	kyubutsu	Hoxx_	ubuntu cant boot without grub
2011-04-16T22:06:00.000Z	Hoxx_	kyubutsu	but I dont want to boot into ubuntu
2011-04-16T22:07:00.000Z	Hoxx_	kyubutsu	the fcked up thing is even without the USB stick that has ubuntu, it STILL goes into grub"
2011-04-16T22:10:00.000Z	Hoxx_	kyubutsu	well usb sticks die
2011-04-16T22:11:00.000Z	kyubutsu	Hoxx_	you have a date for its impending death?
2011-04-16T22:11:00.000Z	Hoxx_	kyubutsu	no, but the main thing is I wanted to keep ubuntu on the USB only
2011-04-16T22:12:00.000Z	Hoxx_	kyubutsu	even if its on the stick?
2011-04-16T22:16:00.000Z	kyubutsu	Hoxx_	your usb install will be there .. it just wont boot without grub taking over first
2011-04-16T22:19:00.000Z	kyubutsu	Hoxx_	follow what bcbc2 suggested
2011-04-16T22:21:00.000Z	kyubutsu	Hoxx_	reintalling windows will probably take MUCH longer than fixing the mbr and adding GRUB to the usb
2011-04-16T22:22:00.000Z	Hoxx_	kyubutsu	I could do the shorrter way but it sounds complicated
2011-04-16T22:22:00.000Z	kyubutsu	Hoxx_	it isnt.. just let it sink in .. it'll come to you
2011-04-16T22:27:00.000Z	kyubutsu	Hoxx_	thats good.. now, go fix the MBR on the hard disk where windows is
2011-04-16T22:27:00.000Z	Hoxx_	kyubutsu	do I have to do that in windows?
2011-04-16T22:27:00.000Z	kyubutsu	Hoxx_	by using the windows install disk , yes
