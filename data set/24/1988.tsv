2009-09-25T05:17:00.000Z	ToStItOs		Does anyone know how to do Internet connection sharing with XP and Ubuntu?
2009-09-25T05:19:00.000Z	ToStItOs		Do i need a crossover cable to do a internet connection between Windows Xp and Ubuntu
2009-09-25T05:20:00.000Z	craigbass1976	ToStItOs	that's only for hookingone computer up directly from nic to nic
2009-09-25T05:20:00.000Z	ToStItOs	craigbass1976	what I want to do is share the connection and files and printer
2009-09-25T05:21:00.000Z	ToStItOs		With the crossover could that be done?
2009-09-25T05:21:00.000Z	craigbass1976	ToStItOs	you'll need a router, or at least a switch; either that or have two nics in one of the machines
2009-09-25T05:22:00.000Z	ToStItOs	craigbass1976	2 NICS?
2009-09-25T05:23:00.000Z	craigbass1976	ToStItOs	ethernet cards
2009-09-25T05:23:00.000Z	ToStItOs	craigbass1976	I have a NIC on each machine but I have dial up so a router is going to be out of the question but you mentioned a switch
2009-09-25T05:24:00.000Z	craigbass1976	ToStItOs	Ahh, then you're all set.  Yes, a crossover will do it.  If you've got crimps and an ethernet end, you can make one.
2009-09-25T05:25:00.000Z	ToStItOs	craigbass1976	Can I buy them or
2009-09-25T05:26:00.000Z	craigbass1976	ToStItOs	yes, you can buy them.  I think all you do is switch the blue and orange though if you use a regular cable, but can't remember if it's the solid or striped blue and orange...
2009-09-25T05:27:00.000Z	ToStItOs	craigbass1976	I'll ask around so with the cable on one end to the XP computer and then the other to Ubuntu will I be able to share the printer
2009-09-25T05:28:00.000Z	craigbass1976	ToStItOs	yes, you'll have to set up SAMBA, unless windows is doing the sharing.  I can give you a "wide open" samba config file if you want
2009-09-25T05:30:00.000Z	ToStItOs	craigbass1976	Let me tell you my set up I have a external modem on the Ubuntu box and the other is Xp so I want the Xp box to do the sharing because thats where my printer is set up
2009-09-25T05:31:00.000Z	craigbass1976	ToStItOs	just share it out then on the xp box and browse for it on the ubuntu box.  Should find it.  I haven't got a regular Ubuntu box here (and no windows in my house anyway) to walk you through the exact process, but that's essentially it
2009-09-25T05:31:00.000Z	craigbass1976	ToStItOs	you should just quit xp...  :P
2009-09-25T05:31:00.000Z	ToStItOs	craigbass1976	Eventually I will
2009-09-25T05:32:00.000Z	craigbass1976	ToStItOs	you'll love it, especially when everyone you know gets hit with the latest porn virus
2009-09-25T05:33:00.000Z	ToStItOs	craigbass1976	This Ubuntu box is my backup in case my Xo box gets toasted
2009-09-25T05:33:00.000Z	ToStItOs	craigbass1976	I 'll play with the crossover cable and set it up
2009-09-25T05:34:00.000Z	craigbass1976	ToStItOs	you may have ot go to a computer shop; I don't know as crossover is something best buy would carry.
2009-09-25T05:35:00.000Z	ToStItOs	craigbass1976	I plan to the stupid forums don't give any specifics
2009-09-25T05:35:00.000Z	ToStItOs	craigbass1976	what pain
