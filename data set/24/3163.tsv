2008-04-25T00:42:00.000Z	DBautell	Cpudan80	I understood that to be the case, but have been informed that it may be broken
2008-04-25T00:42:00.000Z	Cpudan80	DBautell	broken?
2008-04-25T00:43:00.000Z	DBautell	Cpudan80	all I have is this: http://pastebin.com/me18e45a I'll be trying it myself before long
2008-04-25T00:44:00.000Z	Cpudan80	DBautell	According to the bugsite - the fix was pushed out in feb
2008-04-25T00:44:00.000Z	Cpudan80	DBautell	maybe that guy has an old iso
2008-04-25T00:45:00.000Z	DBautell	Cpudan80	could be, I know nothing, just yet
2008-04-25T00:46:00.000Z	Cpudan80	DBautell	only 1 more minute on the download - plus a few for the burn - so we'll see
2008-04-25T00:46:00.000Z	DBautell	Cpudan80	you can just mount the ISO without burning it
2008-04-25T00:47:00.000Z	Cpudan80	DBautell	good point
2008-04-25T00:49:00.000Z	DBautell	Cpudan80	mount -o loop name.iso /dir/to/mnt
2008-04-25T00:49:00.000Z	Cpudan80	DBautell	ty
2008-04-25T00:51:00.000Z	Cpudan80	DBautell	./cdromupgrade
2008-04-25T00:52:00.000Z	DBautell	Cpudan80	does work?
2008-04-25T00:52:00.000Z	Cpudan80	DBautell	looks like there's an error after all
2008-04-25T00:52:00.000Z	DBautell	Cpudan80	:(
2008-04-25T00:52:00.000Z	Cpudan80	DBautell	no - it complains about that tar file missing
2008-04-25T00:55:00.000Z	DBautell	Cpudan80	I wonder if one can add the CD as a repo
2008-04-25T00:56:00.000Z	Cpudan80	DBautell	It works
2008-04-25T00:56:00.000Z	Cpudan80	DBautell	Give it the full path when you exec it
2008-04-25T00:56:00.000Z	Cpudan80	DBautell	debrac@zazu:/media/iso$ sudo /media/iso/cdromupgrade
2008-04-25T00:56:00.000Z	DBautell	Cpudan80	ok, good deal
2008-04-25T00:58:00.000Z	Cpudan80	DBautell	aww man - it wants to remove my apache and VLC
2008-04-25T00:59:00.000Z	DBautell	Cpudan80	both beyond my needs/knowledge... conflicts with other packages?
