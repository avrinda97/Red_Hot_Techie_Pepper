2010-05-28T23:03:00.000Z	mc__	ZenMasta	what version of Ubuntu are you using?
2010-05-28T23:04:00.000Z	ZenMasta	mc__	10.04 just installed from live cd yesterday
2010-05-28T22:58:00.000Z	mc__	ZenMasta	when you start them from the terminal is there any interesting information?
2010-05-28T23:00:00.000Z	ZenMasta	mc__	i'm not starting from terminal... how do I try from the terminal
2010-05-28T23:01:00.000Z	mc__	ZenMasta	open the terminal (Applications - Accessoires - Terminal) and type "sudo synpatic" into it
2010-05-28T23:02:00.000Z	ZenMasta	mc__	it says segmentation fault
2010-05-28T23:05:00.000Z	mc__	ZenMasta	well it looks like you had bad luck, you can not really do something against a segmentation fault besides trying to reinstall the packages
2010-05-28T23:06:00.000Z	ZenMasta	mc__	how can I reinstall the packages if I can't load the package manager or perform similar commands in a terminal without the same error
2010-05-28T23:07:00.000Z	ZenMasta	mc__	ie, sudo apt-get install mysql5  i got segmenation faulty tree... 50%
2010-05-28T23:07:00.000Z	mc__	ZenMasta	whoa well now the only thing I can think of is using dpkg
2010-05-28T23:08:00.000Z	ZenMasta	mc__	i dont know what that is
2010-05-28T23:08:00.000Z	ZenMasta	mc__	do I need to reinstall?
2010-05-28T23:09:00.000Z	mc__	ZenMasta	well since apt-get is broken that would probably be  the best idea
2010-05-28T23:09:00.000Z	ZenMasta	mc__	thanks , but very lame
2010-05-28T23:09:00.000Z	ZenMasta	mc__	guess I'll use the mini cd next time instead of the live
2010-05-28T23:10:00.000Z	mc__	ZenMasta	personally I never had problems with the live cd, but try burning it at a slower speed
2010-05-28T23:11:00.000Z	mc__	ZenMasta	 hopefully it will work better next time :)
2010-05-28T23:13:00.000Z	ZenMasta	mc__	quick search on the forum revealed the solution
2010-05-28T23:13:00.000Z	ZenMasta	mc__	sudo rm /var/cache/apt/*.bin
2010-05-28T23:13:00.000Z	mc__	ZenMasta	and that worked?
2010-05-28T23:18:00.000Z	ZenMasta	mc__	think I'm going to reinstall anyway, terminal is displaying some stuff still :/
2010-05-28T23:25:00.000Z	mc__	ZenMasta	what stuff?
2010-05-28T23:25:00.000Z	ZenMasta	mc__	i just shut down but something about traceback
2010-05-28T23:26:00.000Z	ZenMasta	mc__	probably harmless being that this is a sandbox for me but still
