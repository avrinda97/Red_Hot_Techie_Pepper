2009-10-13T04:11:00.000Z	maco	martin_	cp -R /home/oldname/* /home/newname/
2009-10-13T04:11:00.000Z	maco	martin_	or "mv" instead of "cp -R"
2009-10-13T04:11:00.000Z	maco	martin_	then "sudo chown -R newname:newname /home/newname/*"
2009-10-13T04:11:00.000Z	martin_	maco	but i am viewing the contents of my that home folder, i only see 2 files

2009-10-13T04:12:00.000Z	maco	martin_	OH its encrypted?
2009-10-13T04:13:00.000Z	maco	martin_	try "su olduser -" in a terminal to force that directory to be decrypted?
2009-10-13T04:13:00.000Z	martin_	maco	user does not exist
2009-10-13T04:14:00.000Z	maco	martin_	how did you rename this user?
2009-10-13T04:14:00.000Z	maco	martin_	did you create a new user and remove the old one?
2009-10-13T04:14:00.000Z	maco	martin_	oh
2009-10-13T04:15:00.000Z	maco	martin_	so your encryption key from the old user is....? where?
2009-10-13T04:15:00.000Z	martin_	maco	i dont know, i only see these 2 files and i was told to use the ecrypfts and thats not working so far
2009-10-13T04:16:00.000Z	maco	martin_	dude, i think you deleted your encryption key
