2007-06-29T13:29:00.000Z	wols	zachinglis	as you can see: universe is needed
2007-06-29T13:29:00.000Z	wols	zachinglis	http://packages.ubuntu.com/cgi-bin/search_packages.pl?keywords=libconfig-inifiles-perl&searchon=names&subword=1&version=feisty&release=all
2007-06-29T13:30:00.000Z	zachinglis	wols	i have universe enabled too: http://pastie.caboo.se/74678
2007-06-29T13:31:00.000Z	zachinglis	wols	I know that much. And ?
2007-06-29T13:32:00.000Z	zachinglis	wols	Why did you show me that? I know what apt is/does?
2007-06-29T13:34:00.000Z	wols	zachinglis	but you don't know how to use it
2007-06-29T13:34:00.000Z	zachinglis	wols	How do I not know how to use it? Postfix is having problems, maybe conflictions.
2007-06-29T13:35:00.000Z	wols	zachinglis	you start by reading the url
2007-06-29T13:35:00.000Z	wols	zachinglis	and paste your sources.list. imho your universe repo is wrong or you don't know how to use apt
2007-06-29T13:36:00.000Z	zachinglis	wols	Once again, I know how to use apt-get. My sources.list is fine. It's the bog standard Slicehost sources.list and is perfectly fine.
2007-06-29T13:40:00.000Z	zachinglis	wols	Reading the documentation will not get me any closer to finding out what the reason behind the issues are. I suspsect it is conflictions personally. Though easily could be wrong. So how about, if you're going to hang around a support channel, that you want to help. Rather than acting like it's such a burden to help people and get off your high horse ;) and yes, you think 'helping people who don't help themselves...' bullshit,
2007-06-29T13:40:00.000Z	wols	zachinglis	the issue is apt cannot find the packages. since packages.ubuntu.com does, you did something wrong setting up apt with your universe repos. QeD
2007-06-29T13:41:00.000Z	wols	zachinglis	and I told that to you time and again. if you don't want to listen: your choice. good day
2007-06-29T13:42:00.000Z	zachinglis	wols	you never gave me any direction apart from 'read about the function', I'd of been happy to help myself with more of a clue.
2007-06-29T13:43:00.000Z	zachinglis	wols	Never got those messages.
2007-06-29T13:43:00.000Z	wols	zachinglis	if you know how to use apt, this should be all you need to check for yoursefl. in case if you don't know about apt: read the howto
2007-06-29T13:43:00.000Z	wols	zachinglis	they are public in channel
2007-06-29T13:45:00.000Z	wols	zachinglis	even 56k can keep up with #ubuntu, IF nothing else is running
2007-06-29T13:46:00.000Z	wols	zachinglis	as bruenig said, then you are only lagged. only way to miss something is to disconnect due to excessive lag. youd didn't. now go and fix your problem
2007-06-29T13:49:00.000Z	wols	zachinglis	simply put: ayou accused people wrongly not telling you and you told disprovable lies. we know how irc works
2007-06-29T13:50:00.000Z	zachinglis	wols	And I know what I see.
2007-06-29T13:50:00.000Z	wols	zachinglis	and we know what we see. no go away with your whining. you are OT
2007-06-29T13:50:00.000Z	wols	zachinglis	if you wanna complain about me: !ops | wols was mean to me
2007-06-29T13:57:00.000Z	wols	zachinglis	you are since you are OT
