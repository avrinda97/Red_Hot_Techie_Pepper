2009-06-10T11:15:00.000Z	Stupendoussteve	gangs20003	Lots of good books
2009-06-10T11:16:00.000Z	Stupendoussteve	gangs20003	You could get the Ubuntu Pocket Guide, a PDF is available for free at www.ubuntupocketguide.com/download_main.html
2009-06-10T11:17:00.000Z	Stupendoussteve	gangs20003	Depending on what you want, something like The Practical Guide to Ubuntu Linux may not be a bad idea, or a book on Linux in general, or another related subject you're interested in
2009-06-10T11:21:00.000Z	Stupendoussteve	gangs20003	Not to mention you can program from any text editor out of the box, and then use a built in free compiler to put it together
2009-06-10T11:23:00.000Z	Stupendoussteve	gangs20003	It is a different environment, I find unix to be much more logical and easy to work with
2009-06-10T11:24:00.000Z	Stupendoussteve	gangs20003	You might see if your library has a Linux book. Some of the specifics may be different but the general overview of what it is, what you can accomplish, and why you would use it will be the same
2009-06-10T11:26:00.000Z	Stupendoussteve	gangs20003	Practice using it :) Learn by baby steps. Ubuntu has very good documentation
2009-06-10T11:27:00.000Z	Stupendoussteve	gangs20003	For a good start, other than the book link I sent you, consider https://help.ubuntu.com/9.04/index.html
2009-06-10T11:28:00.000Z	Stupendoussteve	gangs20003	Chances are you don't even need to
2009-06-10T11:28:00.000Z	Stupendoussteve	gangs20003	Through the add/remove programs or package manager, or from a website?
2009-06-10T11:29:00.000Z	Stupendoussteve	gangs20003	It's in the repositories, you don't have to (and it's not suggested you do so)
2009-06-10T11:30:00.000Z	Stupendoussteve	gangs20003	Open Applications > Add/Remove..., change the pull down to All Available Applications and search for Xchat
2009-06-10T11:31:00.000Z	Stupendoussteve	gangs20003	What did it say?
2009-06-10T11:46:00.000Z	Stupendoussteve	gangs20003	You use pppoe? Are you connected to a router or directly to the modem?
2009-06-10T11:46:00.000Z	Stupendoussteve	gangs20003	Have you tried configuring the connection using network manager? (the network icon in the top)
2009-06-10T11:52:00.000Z	Stupendoussteve	gangs20003	No way to configure a connection in there?
2009-06-10T11:55:00.000Z	Stupendoussteve	gangs20003	Actually, you should be able to do it with network manager
2009-06-10T11:55:00.000Z	Stupendoussteve	gangs20003	This is a DSL connection?
2009-06-10T11:55:00.000Z	Stupendoussteve	gangs20003	Are you booted into Ubuntu on that machine?
2009-06-10T11:56:00.000Z	Stupendoussteve	gangs20003	You should be able to right click the network icon, choose Edit Connections, and click DSL and click add
2009-06-10T11:57:00.000Z	Stupendoussteve	gangs20003	And nothing?
2009-06-10T13:22:00.000Z	Stupendoussteve	gangs20003	You can format your drive in the installer and install over it, yes
2009-06-10T13:24:00.000Z	Stupendoussteve	gangs20003	You can choose the partitions you put Ubuntu on, put it on the old Ubuntu one and don't touch the Windows one
