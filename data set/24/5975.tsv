2006-03-11T06:20:00.000Z	Road		Hey everyone.. I was having a problem connecting my windows x server to my ubuntu machine, but I discovered it was caused by the particular firewall software on windows.  I figured I'd post the info on the ubuntu site for the benefit of others.. my question is: where is the approriate place to post this?
2006-03-11T06:22:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	Road	windows X server? you mean XWin32?
2006-03-11T06:23:00.000Z	Road	hatake_kakashi	Yes, a windows X server.  I'm connecting to a ubuntu virtual machine running on vmware.  The server I'm running is called Xmins.
2006-03-11T06:24:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	Road	hmm, not sure, try checking on the forum first to see if anyone has found a solution, and maybe if not, you can try and ask to see if you can post it up and if so, where
2006-03-11T06:24:00.000Z	Road	hatake_kakashi	Okay.. good idea
2006-03-11T06:28:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	Road	are you on dapper?
2006-03-11T06:29:00.000Z	Road	hatake_kakashi	I'm running 5.10 if that's what you mean
2006-03-11T06:30:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	Road	hmm hoary.. and I don't see how the icons could go missing, is it a fresh install?
2006-03-11T06:30:00.000Z	Road	hatake_kakashi	It runs fine locally, the icons are only missing when running the remote x server
2006-03-11T06:30:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	Road	not sure, it might be an issue with the rendering via VMWare or something
2006-03-11T06:31:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	Road	well then I'm not too sure about it :/
2006-03-11T06:31:00.000Z	Road	hatake_kakashi	Strangely enough, it's the (slow) vmware desktop that runs it fine, and only the (fast) x server that shows up strange.. but thanks for the help anyways
2006-03-11T06:32:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	Road	could it be an issue with the remote client? I mean the software?
2006-03-11T06:32:00.000Z	Road	hatake_kakashi	hm.. yes, that's a really good point.. I should try a different one.
2006-03-11T06:33:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	Road	I know there is a commercial one called XWin32, tried on 2 different linux distros and it seemed to render fine
2006-03-11T06:34:00.000Z	Road	hatake_kakashi	okay.. I'll try the demo for that and see how that works
2006-03-11T06:36:00.000Z	Road	hatake_kakashi	Wow, that's old.. my first every computer had that :)
2006-03-11T06:37:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	Road	heh, it was fine at certain res but I was sure that it could do much better than having very small amount of resolution
2006-03-11T06:37:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	Road	any luck with XWin32?
2006-03-11T06:37:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	Road	ok, coolies
2006-03-11T06:43:00.000Z	Road	hatake_kakashi	Thanks man.. you were right.  Running XWin32 fixes the display glitches.
2006-03-11T06:44:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	Road	np
2006-03-11T06:45:00.000Z	Road	hatake_kakashi	And sorry.. it had nothing to do with linux after all
2006-03-11T06:45:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	Road	well that shouldn't be a problem but anyway :)
