2007-07-21T15:31:00.000Z	mustang97		So noone knows how to install jdk.  I dont need the automated wannabe help crap.   I have certain reasons for installing jdk and I have errors I can post them. but I need to get it installed!
2007-07-21T15:32:00.000Z	dystopianray	mustang97	which jdk do you want?
2007-07-21T15:33:00.000Z	dystopianray	mustang97	sudo apt-get install sun-java5-jdk
2007-07-21T15:33:00.000Z	dystopianray	mustang97	it should 'just work'
2007-07-21T15:34:00.000Z	dystopianray	mustang97	what exactly are you trying to do?
2007-07-21T15:45:00.000Z	dystopianray	mustang97	use 'ln'
2007-07-21T15:46:00.000Z	dystopianray	mustang97	what exactly do you need to link to?
2007-07-21T15:48:00.000Z	dystopianray	mustang97	/usr/bin/java
2007-07-21T15:49:00.000Z	dystopianray	mustang97	the jdk doesn't reside in any one place, it is installed like any other application
2007-07-21T15:49:00.000Z	dystopianray	mustang97	the 'java' binary is in /usr/bin/
2007-07-21T15:52:00.000Z	dystopianray	mustang97	why does it need a symlink anyway? 'java' is in your path
2007-07-21T15:54:00.000Z	dystopianray	mustang97	you already have java
2007-07-21T15:54:00.000Z	dystopianray	mustang97	your system is already setup like that
2007-07-21T15:56:00.000Z	dystopianray	mustang97	the jdk is the software development kit for java
2007-07-21T15:56:00.000Z	dystopianray	mustang97	did you install it from the repos?
2007-07-21T15:56:00.000Z	dystopianray	mustang97	sun-java5-jdk or sun-java6-jdk
2007-07-21T15:58:00.000Z	dystopianray	mustang97	what are the errors?
2007-07-21T16:00:00.000Z	dystopianray	mustang97	pastebin the errors
2007-07-22T16:03:00.000Z	dystopianray	mustang97	install sun-java5-jdk
2007-07-22T16:04:00.000Z	dystopianray	mustang97	if you have installed the jdk, then /usr/bin/java should exist
2007-07-22T16:05:00.000Z	dystopianray	mustang97	and from your instructions, that should be sufficient
2007-07-22T16:06:00.000Z	dystopianray	mustang97	install sun-java5-jdk, then you will have /usr/bin/java
2007-07-22T16:06:00.000Z	dystopianray	mustang97	do not install the rpm, install it from the repos
2007-07-22T16:07:00.000Z	dystopianray	mustang97	pastebin any errors you get
