2008-05-04T05:13:00.000Z	mysterycool	alado2	Oh, been through that.
2008-05-04T05:13:00.000Z	alado2	mysterycool	yes me too, with gutsy, but now i forgot how i did it
2008-05-04T05:14:00.000Z	mysterycool	alado2	Ok, I do not really remember, but I downloaded Real Player through the Real Player Website.
2008-05-04T05:14:00.000Z	alado2	mysterycool	yes but i want the nightly, you can fast forward better with that one
2008-05-04T05:15:00.000Z	mysterycool	alado2	Hmm, ok. Did you try to download .bin version?
2008-05-04T05:15:00.000Z	mysterycool	alado2	download the .bin version. it is way easier to install =]
2008-05-04T05:16:00.000Z	alado2	mysterycool	yes i tried, but i cant seem to get it to execute
2008-05-04T05:16:00.000Z	mysterycool	alado2	Hmm, did u give it permission to execute? I mean, did u make it exectable?
2008-05-04T05:16:00.000Z	alado2	mysterycool	yes i think so
2008-05-04T05:17:00.000Z	mysterycool	alado2	u think so? :p
2008-05-04T05:18:00.000Z	mysterycool	alado2	make it executable then try and run it =]
2008-05-04T05:18:00.000Z	alado2	mysterycool	yes i "think" so, cause nothing happened :) but i did chmod it
2008-05-04T05:20:00.000Z	mysterycool	alado2	Ok, to be sure, find the .bin file and right click and go to Propertis.
2008-05-04T05:22:00.000Z	alado2	mysterycool	this is what i have been doing: ~/Desktop$ chmod a+x real.bin
2008-05-04T05:22:00.000Z	alado2	mysterycool	/Desktop$ sudo real.bin
2008-05-04T05:24:00.000Z	alado2	mysterycool	that didnt work so i downloaded the tar file, unpacked it, yes i know its an archive amenado, then i tried the bin file in that one as well
2008-05-04T05:26:00.000Z	mysterycool	alado2	ok cuz i was never really good with the terminal stuff, please do in the terminal: sudo nautilus /home/user/Desktop
2008-05-04T05:27:00.000Z	mysterycool	alado2	then, find the realplaer .bin gile and right click -> propertis and check if it is marked as execuatable =]
2008-05-04T05:30:00.000Z	alado2	mysterycool	im giving up, too tired, thnx anyway
