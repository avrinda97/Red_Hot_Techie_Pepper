2010-05-05T06:26:00.000Z	quietone		can anyone explain why when I booted recovery mode to root my HDMI output started working? Previously, a 'normal' reboot would not get it working.
2010-05-05T06:27:00.000Z	haavaros	quietone	I can't explain that, but I have problems with HDMI too
2010-05-05T06:27:00.000Z	haavaros	quietone	if you type aplay -l in terminal, what's the output?
2010-05-05T06:29:00.000Z	quietone	haavaros	 Intel [HDA Intel], device 0: STAC92xx Analog [STAC92xx Analog].
2010-05-05T06:31:00.000Z	haavaros	quietone	to me it seems that HDMI isn't detected, I would expect a device named something with "HDMI" to be listed
2010-05-05T06:32:00.000Z	quietone	haavaros	what bothers me is that I can't yet get a consistent way to get HDMI to work. Plus Vista would not work today either.
2010-05-05T06:32:00.000Z	quietone	haavaros	It is working right now. At least my wallpaper is showing on the HD TV
2010-05-05T06:33:00.000Z	quietone	haavaros	Oops, missed this line - card 0: Intel [HDA Intel], device 3: INTEL HDMI [INTEL HDMI]
2010-05-05T06:33:00.000Z	haavaros	quietone	That's the one I was hoping for
2010-05-05T06:34:00.000Z	haavaros	quietone	try 'aplay -D plughw:0,3 <anywavfile>.wav'
2010-05-05T06:36:00.000Z	quietone	haavaros	Yes, it is playing out the TV speakers. But, I don't trust that it will work in the future.
2010-05-05T06:38:00.000Z	haavaros	quietone	You have to add that output as your default, by editing /etc/asound.conf, look at the last part of http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=6690552&postcount=4
2010-05-05T06:39:00.000Z	quietone	haavaros	that will take care of the video as well?
2010-05-05T06:40:00.000Z	haavaros	quietone	That's for sound, sry, didn't see you have video problems as well
2010-05-05T06:41:00.000Z	haavaros	quietone	I guess you have had a look at display settings under system prefs?
2010-05-05T06:41:00.000Z	quietone	haavaros	that's Ok. I'm happy to learn how to manage my machines
2010-05-05T06:43:00.000Z	quietone	haavaros	the display preferences is always an accurate representation of what ubuntu thinks is available. But, sadly, even when connected to TV is often (well mostly now) fails to see it. I'd like to know a way to force it to see the external monitor.
2010-05-05T06:51:00.000Z	haavaros	quietone	I don't know how to force detection, but since Vista also sometimes fails, I suspect hw issue. Pls hilight me if you solve it, would love to see the solution
2010-05-05T06:54:00.000Z	quietone	haavaros	The Dell tech thinks it is software! And he doesn't want to get rid of Vista (which I plan to today) as they don't support Ubuntu here.
2010-05-05T06:55:00.000Z	haavaros	quietone	Odd. Well, have dell help you rule out hw issues before removing vista
2010-05-05T06:56:00.000Z	quietone	haavaros	That would make sense but they have no testing facilities here. The best I could do is find a friend with an HDMI monitor/TV and I don't know of any. or at my workplace or my partners.
2010-05-05T07:01:00.000Z	quietone	haavaros	Dell can't rule out hardware issues. The only option they can provide is giving me a refurbished mother board (which I don't want).
2010-05-05T07:01:00.000Z	quietone	haavaros	thx for support. I must go join the family.
2010-05-05T07:02:00.000Z	haavaros	quietone	gl with motherboard and family L:)
