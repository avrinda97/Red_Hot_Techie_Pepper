2011-11-03T06:25:00.000Z	cyphase		the 'gnome classic' sucks
2011-11-03T06:25:00.000Z	cyphase		if you mean gnome-session-fallback
2011-11-03T06:25:00.000Z	Scott0	cyphase	compared to what?
2011-11-03T06:25:00.000Z	cyphase	Scott0	compared to what i have now on my 11.04 machine
2011-11-03T06:25:00.000Z	Scott0	cyphase	are you rich?
2011-11-03T06:26:00.000Z	Scott0	cyphase	my hardware cant support the pretty crap
2011-11-03T06:26:00.000Z	cyphase	Scott0	i think you misunderstand. on 11.04 i'm using gnome2, with gnome-panel
2011-11-03T06:26:00.000Z	cyphase	Scott0	and it looks like it always has
2011-11-03T06:26:00.000Z	Scott0	cyphase	oooh
2011-11-03T06:26:00.000Z	cyphase	Scott0	but in 11.10 gnome-session-fallback's gnome-panel is crap
2011-11-03T06:27:00.000Z	Scott0	cyphase	im on 11.04 using "Ubuntu Classic no effects"
2011-11-03T06:27:00.000Z	cyphase	Scott0	i'm using classic with effects
2011-11-03T06:27:00.000Z	Scott0	cyphase	whats the alrternative with 11.10?
2011-11-03T06:27:00.000Z	cyphase	Scott0	i don't know, but i'm gonna take a look at kde now. never though i'd say that
2011-11-03T06:28:00.000Z	cyphase	Scott0	i'll give gnome-shell and unity a chance
2011-11-03T06:30:00.000Z	Scott0	cyphase	lol
2011-11-03T06:31:00.000Z	Scott0	cyphase	have you tried gnome3?
2011-11-03T06:31:00.000Z	cyphase	Scott0	i've given it a cursory try. i dont think i like it, but im gonna give it a chance
2011-11-03T06:41:00.000Z	cyphase	Scott0	Alt+right-click lets you add things to the panel
2011-11-03T06:41:00.000Z	cyphase	Scott0	in gnome-classic
2011-11-03T06:41:00.000Z	Scott0	cyphase	is that good?
2011-11-03T06:42:00.000Z	cyphase	Scott0	at least you *can* add things to the panel. i thought it wast possible after i tried before
2011-11-03T06:46:00.000Z	Scott0	cyphase	we need to share experiences as it seems as we are looking for the same thing
2011-11-03T06:47:00.000Z	cyphase	Scott0	sure. PM me so we don't annoy the rest of the channel :P
