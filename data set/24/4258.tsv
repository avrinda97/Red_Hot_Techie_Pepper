2008-01-11T06:32:00.000Z	apathy		Hey I got ubuntu 64 installed finally right now
2008-01-11T06:33:00.000Z	apathy		I was wondering if google video works for anyone
2008-01-11T06:34:00.000Z	apathy		does it play in fullscreen?
2008-01-11T06:34:00.000Z	apathy		I can get it to show up in normal size but when I try to resize google videos they disappear but the sound keeps going
2008-01-11T06:34:00.000Z	apathy		youtube works good though
2008-01-11T06:35:00.000Z	apathy		do you have 64-bit?
2008-01-11T06:35:00.000Z	apathy		ok
2008-01-11T06:36:00.000Z	apathy		yea I heard, I was hoping to figure it out
2008-01-11T06:36:00.000Z	apathy		so far ubuntu is cool though, I like it
2008-01-11T06:37:00.000Z	apathy		I just installed the 64bit version and I'm wondering what else I need to do, do I need java or anything?
2008-01-11T06:38:00.000Z	silent_	apathy	if you're going to run java applets you sure do
2008-01-11T06:38:00.000Z	silent_	apathy	if you're asking what you need to do if you have 64 bit, I'd really suggest you install 32 bit, or book a few weeks off
2008-01-11T06:39:00.000Z	silent_	apathy	get 32 bit, 64 bit for a first-timer will not be pleasant... and there's no big performance hit
2008-01-11T06:41:00.000Z	silent_	apathy	I do, on a 64-bit capable processor no less
2008-01-11T06:41:00.000Z	silent_	apathy	my server is 64 bit though
2008-01-11T06:42:00.000Z	silent_	apathy	if you want to get internet plugins working, just get 32 bit
2008-01-11T06:42:00.000Z	silent_	apathy	just play around with stuff while it downloads... get familiar with the interfaces
2008-01-11T06:42:00.000Z	silent_	apathy	the install doesnt take long at all
2008-01-11T06:43:00.000Z	silent_	apathy	good, so do I
2008-01-11T06:43:00.000Z	silent_	apathy	you'll only discover more good things as you go along
2008-01-11T06:44:00.000Z	silent_	apathy	and maybe even some classic linux bad things, but those can be overcome easily. The community is very large and the forum is very useful
2008-01-11T06:45:00.000Z	silent_	apathy	the thing that wows me most about linux is the superior sound architecture
2008-01-11T06:46:00.000Z	silent_	apathy	It's amazing what linux can do with old hardware, truly
2008-01-11T06:47:00.000Z	silent_	apathy	my athlon xp 1.6Ghz machine was more responsive at times than my E6300 Core 2 Duo 3Ghz, 4GB memory machine running vista
