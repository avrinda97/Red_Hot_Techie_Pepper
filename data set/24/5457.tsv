2006-12-06T08:22:00.000Z	Eclypse	timo91	persistent?
2006-12-06T08:24:00.000Z	Eclypse	timo91	have you posted on the ubuntuforums?
2006-12-06T08:24:00.000Z	Eclypse	timo91	they are often much more helpful then the IRC
2006-12-06T08:24:00.000Z	Eclypse	timo91	unless you're setting up something like compiz.
2006-12-06T08:25:00.000Z	Eclypse	timo91	we're all normal.  we all have basic needs that we need fofilled. and sometimes those needs are ridiculously hard to satisfy in linux.
2006-12-06T08:26:00.000Z	Eclypse	timo91	in your case, hardware incapatability, your best bet is posting on the forum, trust me.
2006-12-06T08:26:00.000Z	Eclypse	timo91	its the most active form I've ever been to in my life, lol, 2000 people active half the time.
2006-12-06T08:26:00.000Z	Eclypse	timo91	www.ubuntuforums.org
2006-12-06T08:27:00.000Z	Eclypse	timo91	and if you are wondering, my account name is Patrick-Ruff
2006-12-06T08:28:00.000Z	Eclypse	timo91	ubuntu is your main computer?
2006-12-06T08:32:00.000Z	Eclypse	timo91	dude, when you can't open any programs you restart . . . lol
2006-12-06T08:32:00.000Z	Eclypse	timo91	that's like the first resort.
2006-12-06T08:32:00.000Z	Eclypse	timo91	go restart.
