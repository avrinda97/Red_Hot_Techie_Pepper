2010-04-10T05:44:00.000Z	Arch_NME		hmm
2010-04-10T05:45:00.000Z	Arch_NME		well the installer ran succesfully and all
2010-04-10T05:45:00.000Z	Arch_NME		however how can I tell my current driver?
2010-04-10T05:45:00.000Z	Arch_NME		is there a terminal command to make the system tell me my current video driver version?
2010-04-10T05:46:00.000Z	Arch_NME		Sia: could you tell me what it is ;)
2010-04-10T05:48:00.000Z	Arch_NME		sia: is ther a way to make that say more info?
2010-04-10T05:48:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Arch_NME	actually lspci will only show the card manufacture/version not the driver version #  (even "lspci -vnvn" doesn't show driver version #)
2010-04-10T05:49:00.000Z	Arch_NME	ZykoticK9	any idea how to see driver version?
2010-04-10T05:49:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Arch_NME	what card are you using?
2010-04-10T05:49:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Arch_NME	that's ATI right?
2010-04-10T05:50:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Arch_NME	did you install the nvidia driver from the repo or some 3rd party method?
2010-04-10T05:50:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Arch_NME	nvidia-setting would certainly tell you
2010-04-10T23:34:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Arch_NME	isn't nvclock in the default repository?  why are you compiling it?
2010-04-10T23:53:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Arch_NME	you do have Xorg installed correct?  just going from the error message.
2010-04-10T23:54:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Arch_NME	sorry - I'm sure you do then (xorg is the GUI)
2010-04-10T23:55:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Arch_NME	Losha have you tried the nvclock in the default repository?  sudo apt-get install nvclock?
2010-04-10T23:57:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Arch_NME	what version of Ubuntu are you using?
2010-04-10T23:58:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Arch_NME	then nvclock should be in the repo
2010-04-11T00:31:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Arch_NME	"gksu gedit /path/to/file"
2010-04-11T00:31:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Arch_NME	don't fear the terminal :)
2010-04-11T00:33:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Arch_NME	if you really wanted you could create a new launch with "gksu gedit" as the command (probably not the best idea however)
2010-04-11T00:35:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Arch_NME	for someone who wants to be lazy you need to start getting lazy in the console/irc channel -- typing ZykoticK9 is a drag, Zy(TAB) is the lazy/smart way to do it ;)
2010-04-11T00:35:00.000Z	Arch_NME	ZykoticK9	yes yes
2010-04-11T00:36:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Arch_NME	look into histo's suggestion - probably exactly what you want
