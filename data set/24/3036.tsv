2008-05-17T05:27:00.000Z	sudobash		but yes it supports ntfs
2008-05-17T05:28:00.000Z	sudobash		to read and write with ntfs-3g which is now in default install
2008-05-17T05:28:00.000Z	sudobash		but you can not use ubuntu on an ntfs partition
2008-05-17T05:28:00.000Z	sudobash		or install it to ntfs partition
2008-05-17T05:29:00.000Z	sudobash		it uses ext2/ext3 and swap among a few other choices
2008-05-17T05:29:00.000Z	sudobash		sudo apt-get install gparted
2008-05-17T05:30:00.000Z	sudobash		is it on live cd?
2008-05-17T05:30:00.000Z	sudobash		thats cool
2008-05-17T05:30:00.000Z	sudobash		it is all in the file header
2008-05-17T05:32:00.000Z	sudobash		i mean /etc/apt/sources.list
2008-05-17T05:34:00.000Z	temagant	sudobash	it doesn't, though...
2008-05-17T05:34:00.000Z	temagant		Install ndisgtk (System → Administration → Synaptic Package Manager). is all it says
2008-05-17T05:35:00.000Z	sudobash		yeah if you have installed ubuntu succesfully you probably used ext3 and swap
2008-05-17T05:35:00.000Z	sudobash		you must have been confused or something
2008-05-17T05:36:00.000Z	sudobash		or maybe i am
2008-05-17T05:37:00.000Z	sudobash		did you read that link i gave you it showed you how to get the drivers in with ndiswrapper better than i could tell you
2008-05-17T05:37:00.000Z	sudobash		http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/topic67003.html
2008-05-17T05:38:00.000Z	sudobash	asclepius28	well if you have any files you overwrote you might be able to still recover them just use GetDataBack
2008-05-17T05:38:00.000Z	temagant		But even searching the repositories for ndisgtk or ndis comes up with no results.
2008-05-17T05:39:00.000Z	sudobash		yeah reinstall grub but use the SuperGrub Disk
2008-05-17T05:40:00.000Z	sudobash		SuperGrub Disk is your Friend
2008-05-17T05:42:00.000Z	sudobash		sudo apt-get install ndiswrapper-utils
2008-05-17T05:42:00.000Z	sudobash		my bad its been a while since i have used ndiswrapper
2008-05-17T05:42:00.000Z	temagant	sudobash	That didn't work either.
