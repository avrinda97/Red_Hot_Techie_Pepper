2011-11-24T02:26:00.000Z	Deltatash		but when I boot up it defaults to a lower resolution regardless of what is in the .vbox config file... wtf lol
2011-11-24T02:27:00.000Z	Deltatash		you think its cus I am having to use a .iso boot loader to boot the OS ?
2011-11-24T02:27:00.000Z	Deltatash		maybe the boot loader is defaulting it for some reason
2011-11-24T02:29:00.000Z	Deltatash		Gentoo dunno I went to the VM directory that its saved in and apparently the .vbox file is the config file
2011-11-24T02:31:00.000Z	Deltatash		I am using EmpireEFI4AMD.iso to boot it im just wondering if that is defaulting it ?
2011-11-24T02:31:00.000Z	Deltatash		maybe I can try... but im not sure there is a guest additions for mac os x I will check
2011-11-24T02:31:00.000Z	Gentoo64	Deltatash	there arent
2011-11-24T02:28:00.000Z	Gentoo64	Deltatash	you mean additions? no
2011-11-24T02:29:00.000Z	Gentoo64	Deltatash	sorry i wasnt following properlu
2011-11-24T02:32:00.000Z	Gentoo64	Deltatash	i have osx in a vm and its pretty sucky with no additions
2011-11-24T02:33:00.000Z	Gentoo64	Deltatash	its more than usable with no additions :s
2011-11-24T02:33:00.000Z	Gentoo64	Deltatash	its fast on mine
2011-11-24T02:33:00.000Z	Gentoo64	Deltatash	yeah, but additions would make it faster
2011-11-24T02:36:00.000Z	Gentoo64	Deltatash	yeah thats why i put mine in vm just to mess around with it
2011-11-24T02:37:00.000Z	Gentoo64	Deltatash	not possible afaik. i really dont know anything about mac, but you may be able to tweak a file
2011-11-24T02:38:00.000Z	Gentoo64	Deltatash	i was playing with a openbsd guest and could tweak the xorg.conf in some odd way to get massive res with no additions
2011-11-24T02:38:00.000Z	Gentoo64	Deltatash	but itll always be laggy
2011-11-24T02:38:00.000Z	Gentoo64	Deltatash	tbh youll just have to deal with it
2011-11-24T02:39:00.000Z	Gentoo64	Deltatash	id rather use linux lol
2011-11-24T02:40:00.000Z	Gentoo64	Deltatash	nah its very picky. i think i have the hardware for it. i even tried it once. but messing with the kext etc isnt worth it, upgreades might or might not fail. plus the fact that i hate mac anyway
2011-11-24T02:40:00.000Z	Gentoo64	Deltatash	no. just sue the laggy one in vbox
2011-11-24T02:41:00.000Z	Gentoo64	Deltatash	thats what i mean i think its the best youll get without buying one :)
2011-11-24T03:02:00.000Z	Deltatash	Gentoo64	You can have some of my sandwich cus your a linux user! makes you call ;D
2011-11-24T03:14:00.000Z	Deltatash	Gentoo64	how dare you swear in here!
