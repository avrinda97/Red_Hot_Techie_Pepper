2007-02-18T14:39:00.000Z	TubularBell		Anyone else have an idea where I should look when Ubuntu can't connect to the net at all? Personally I get the feeling it might have something to do with my NIC not being recognized or something, but that's a wild gues.s
2007-02-18T14:40:00.000Z	TubularBell		Hmm.. where would it show that, Psy?
2007-02-18T14:40:00.000Z	soundray	TubularBell	first thing to check is whether you have any interfaces when you open System-Administration-Networking
2007-02-18T14:42:00.000Z	soundray	TubularBell	if your NIC is a regular Ethernet one, the interface name would be eth0. You could look through /var/log/syslog for any error messages relating to eth0.
2007-02-18T14:42:00.000Z	soundray	TubularBell	lspci might come in handy, too. It lists your PCI devices.
2007-02-18T14:44:00.000Z	TubularBell	soundray	where can I find this lspci that you speak of? (sorry.. you're talking to a very clueless first-timer here.. don't know my way around yet)
2007-02-18T14:45:00.000Z	soundray	TubularBell	it's a command line program, to be entered in the terminal (Applications-Accessories-Terminal)
2007-02-18T14:47:00.000Z	TubularBell	soundray	What should I be looking for in the lspci output?
2007-02-18T14:48:00.000Z	soundray	TubularBell	a line that corresponds to your NIC. It will be a starting point for, e.g., web searches
2007-02-18T15:04:00.000Z	TubularBell	soundray	Ok, I'm back. Results: Nothing related to ethernet in /var/log/syslog, except for some entries about registering protocols. LSPCI only listed a very long list of unknown nVidia devices.. which makes sense, since there's a boatload of nVidia devices on my mobo, including the NIC in question.
2007-02-18T15:05:00.000Z	soundray	TubularBell	is it a very new board?
2007-02-18T15:07:00.000Z	soundray	TubularBell	I couldn't run edgy on a recent machine (Mac Pro), so I tried feisty on it. I know it's not recommended to use for production, but hey, my choice is not to use it at all with Linux.
2007-02-18T15:07:00.000Z	soundray	TubularBell	so, while keeping in mind !worksforme, it might be worth trying that.
2007-02-18T15:09:00.000Z	TubularBell	soundray	Dare I say 'Eek!' ... I was hoping to just drop the CD in my drive and be ready to go. Oh well.. I'll give it a try. It's just an issue of downloading the ISO, burning it to a CD and follow same procedure as before, right?
2007-02-18T15:09:00.000Z	soundray	TubularBell	yes. Make sure you use the most recent incarnation, Herd 4, and ask in #ubuntu+1 if you need help.
2007-02-18T15:10:00.000Z	TubularBell	soundray	Just to make sure I end up with the proper image, would it be possible for you to give a link or filename?
2007-02-18T15:11:00.000Z	soundray	TubularBell	http://www.ubuntu.com/testing/herd4#head-084dad4c9e2cc8b31b49b0f497b2ddde4ba42b55
2007-02-18T15:12:00.000Z	TubularBell	soundray	You have my gratitude...
2007-02-18T15:12:00.000Z	soundray	TubularBell	good luck
2007-02-18T15:14:00.000Z	TubularBell	soundray	Do I need the 64-bit when using an AMD Athlon XP 64X2, or can I just use the classic 32-bit? (I'm a bit 64-bit shy after having had to return WinXP 64 to the store due to essential software not working on it..)
2007-02-18T15:15:00.000Z	soundray	TubularBell	32bit will work, albeit slightly slower on numbercrunching tasks
2007-02-18T15:16:00.000Z	TubularBell	soundray	Not intending on doing anything of that sort.. most intense use this install will see is webapp development
2007-02-18T15:17:00.000Z	soundray	TubularBell	i386 is warmly recommended in that case
2007-02-18T15:17:00.000Z	TubularBell	soundray	Will do, then.
