2011-07-10T07:58:00.000Z	zykotick9	rww	does the captial X actually change based on directory/files?
2011-07-10T07:59:00.000Z	rww	zykotick9	+X sets the execute bit if 1) the file is a directory or 2) the file is already executable for some user
2011-07-10T08:00:00.000Z	rww	zykotick9	I haven't been paying attention, so additional stuff may be needed for this situation, iono.

2011-07-31T21:56:00.000Z	rww	zykotick9	ikonia: 17:52 < stephenmac7> Hello, I just got an Acer Aspire 5253-BZ602 (Uses AMD APU) and it seems that Ubuntu does not recognise the internal microphone.
2011-07-31T21:56:00.000Z	rww	zykotick9	ikonia: then they nicked to arch_is_awesome.
2011-07-31T21:56:00.000Z	rww	zykotick9	ikonia: Note 1) the question being asked, 2) them specifically mentioning Ubuntu
2011-08-19T09:08:00.000Z	rww	zykotick9	yes, you did :(
2011-08-20T23:52:00.000Z	rww	zykotick9	oneiric does indeed have hybrid images now :)
2011-08-20T23:52:00.000Z	zykotick9	rww	i was certainly under the impression it was coming for sure, didn't know it was already there - thanks.
2011-08-20T23:53:00.000Z	rww	zykotick9	yup, the daily ISOs and I think maybe the alpha3 ones do it if you want to try it out
2011-09-02T10:15:00.000Z	zykotick9	rww	sorry personal question - have you always used KDE?
2011-09-02T10:16:00.000Z	rww	zykotick9	I've hopped around a lot. KDE's been my favorite for long enough that it's likely I'll stick with it
2011-09-02T10:17:00.000Z	zykotick9	rww	thanks, just curious
2011-09-07T08:21:00.000Z	zykotick9	rww	can't you just logout, then use the DM to shutdown?
2011-09-07T08:21:00.000Z	rww	zykotick9	Is there a Logout option somewhere I'm not seeing?
