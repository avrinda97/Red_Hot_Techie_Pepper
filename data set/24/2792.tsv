2008-08-28T07:07:00.000Z	Addernator		the guide is complete nonsense
2008-08-28T07:07:00.000Z	Addernator		it says to connect to it using a browser
2008-08-28T07:07:00.000Z	R_YoYo_R	Addernator	this isnt a place to discuss how to set up your router unfourtunatley
2008-08-28T07:07:00.000Z	Addernator		i type the i.p it gives me but the browser just searches for it on google
2008-08-28T07:07:00.000Z	R_YoYo_R		yes you usually configure your router by browsing to it from a web browser
2008-08-28T07:08:00.000Z	R_YoYo_R	Addernator	can you ping it
2008-08-28T07:08:00.000Z	Addernator		well then where do i go to do it?
