2011-11-22T12:15:00.000Z	lxyu		hello, I try to use this command in lftp "open ftp://user/name:password@example.com", which 'user/name' is my ftp account name and can't be changed. this give out an error "Name or service not known", how to resolve it
2011-11-22T12:16:00.000Z	iceroot	lxyu	why doing that?
2011-11-22T12:17:00.000Z	iceroot	lxyu	that should break everything
2011-11-22T12:17:00.000Z	lxyu	iceroot	the service provider do it..
2011-11-22T12:17:00.000Z	iceroot	lxyu	beat him
2011-11-22T12:18:00.000Z	iceroot	lxyu	maybe try this "user\/name"
2011-11-22T12:18:00.000Z	iceroot	lxyu	but dont forget to beat him
2011-11-22T12:19:00.000Z	lxyu	iceroot	it's not working..
2011-11-22T12:19:00.000Z	iceroot	lxyu	i didnt even know / is allowed in usernames
2011-11-22T12:19:00.000Z	lxyu	iceroot	the same. I don't know it before.
2011-11-22T12:20:00.000Z	iceroot	lxyu	just tell him he should give you a real username
2011-11-22T12:21:00.000Z	iceroot	lxyu	try user\name
2011-11-22T12:21:00.000Z	iceroot	lxyu	\ not /
2011-11-22T12:21:00.000Z	iceroot	lxyu	and also try only the thing after \
2011-11-22T12:22:00.000Z	lxyu	iceroot	open ftp://user\name:password@example.com not working
2011-11-22T12:22:00.000Z	iceroot	lxyu	open ftp://name:password@example.com not working
2011-11-22T12:22:00.000Z	iceroot	lxyu	open ftp://name:password@example.com
2011-11-22T12:22:00.000Z	iceroot	lxyu	only everything after \
2011-11-22T12:23:00.000Z	iceroot	lxyu	if that is not working, beatm him
2011-11-22T12:24:00.000Z	lxyu	iceroot	not working. in lftp, this command "user user/name" and manually input password works.
2011-11-22T12:24:00.000Z	iceroot	lxyu	ok
2011-11-22T12:24:00.000Z	iceroot	lxyu	but beat him or better, change the provider
2011-11-22T12:24:00.000Z	iceroot	lxyu	a provider which is giving such names is a very bad provider
2011-11-22T12:25:00.000Z	lxyu	iceroot	I'll try contact the provider then..
