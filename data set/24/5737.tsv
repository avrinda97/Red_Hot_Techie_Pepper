2008-07-31T18:21:00.000Z	ikonia	will00	what program
2008-07-31T18:22:00.000Z	will00	ikonia	gproftpd
2008-07-31T18:22:00.000Z	ikonia	will00	that shouldn't need a root password
2008-07-31T18:23:00.000Z	will00	ikonia	it does, apt-get auto puts that under system-> administration. and i cant launch it from the command line as a regular user
2008-07-31T18:23:00.000Z	ikonia	will00	so use sudo, or gksudo
2008-07-31T18:25:00.000Z	will00	ikonia	it still requires the password
2008-07-31T18:25:00.000Z	ikonia	will00	what command are you using ?
2008-07-31T18:25:00.000Z	ikonia	will00	and it asks you for your "user" password
2008-07-31T18:25:00.000Z	will00	ikonia	yea thats about the extent of it
2008-07-31T18:25:00.000Z	ikonia	will00	so put your user password in
2008-07-31T18:26:00.000Z	will00	ikonia	yes and that launches it, but i want it to launch automatically without the need for any password
2008-07-31T18:26:00.000Z	ikonia	will00	then use the init script, there should be an init script in /etc/init.d
2008-07-31T18:27:00.000Z	will00	ikonia	no there isnt, not for gproftpd
2008-07-31T18:27:00.000Z	ikonia	will00	ok, right one
2008-07-31T18:28:00.000Z	will00	ikonia	how exactly would i go about doing that?
2008-07-31T18:28:00.000Z	ikonia	will00	use one of the templates in /etc/init.d
2008-07-31T18:34:00.000Z	will00	ikonia	so everything in the etc/init.d folder is run with superuser privelages?
2008-07-31T18:34:00.000Z	ikonia	will00	correct
2008-07-31T18:34:00.000Z	will00	ikonia	ok
2008-07-31T18:34:00.000Z	will00	ikonia	just one more thing, where are the templates?
2008-07-31T18:36:00.000Z	ikonia	will00	use one of the other scripts
2008-07-31T18:36:00.000Z	will00	ikonia	ok
2008-07-31T18:45:00.000Z	will00	ikonia	ok, i wrote the script, do i have to do anything else to get it to work
