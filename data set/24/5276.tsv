2007-09-13T08:59:00.000Z	noor	nickrud	so i run that in terminal?
2007-09-13T09:00:00.000Z	nickrud	noor	the info should have showed up in another tab
2007-09-13T09:00:00.000Z	noor	nickrud	THX
2007-12-16T00:05:00.000Z	nickrud	noor	you should just be able to drag the icon pack onto system->prefs->appearance
2007-12-16T00:06:00.000Z	noor	nickrud	well i tried that but nothing happend :( its a tar.gz file
2007-12-16T00:07:00.000Z	nickrud	noor	then mkdir ~/.icons  if needed , then cd ~/.icons && tar xf /path/to/icon.tar.gz
2007-12-16T00:07:00.000Z	nickrud	noor	this is assuming it's a standard icon pack for gnome
2007-12-16T00:08:00.000Z	noor	nickrud	if this works man ill love you forever
2007-12-16T00:08:00.000Z	nickrud	noor	no kisses, ok ;p

2007-12-16T00:13:00.000Z	noor	nickrud	thx man srsly now im going back to my cave
2007-12-16T22:29:00.000Z	nickrud	noor	basically good, but put a && before wget (will run wget if the cd was successful)
2008-01-07T01:50:00.000Z	nickrud	noor	not funny (and no, if you don't get the malicious joke)
