2011-12-12T14:45:00.000Z	almoxarife	rasmusth	you don't have the pub keys for the ppa, and being told so
2011-12-12T14:48:00.000Z	almoxarife	rasmusth	no, ppa's are sort of the wild wild west, on you to make them work and suffer when they cripple your system
2011-12-12T14:49:00.000Z	rasmusth	almoxarife	okay that doesnt make a lot of sense though as I have not changed anything, it stopped working on its own
2011-12-12T14:49:00.000Z	almoxarife	rasmusth	you had to have added the ppa, it did not happen via ubuntu alone
2011-12-12T14:50:00.000Z	rasmusth	almoxarife	even if I remove everything from the list, it still doesnt work
2011-12-12T14:51:00.000Z	almoxarife	rasmusth	it? and list?
2011-12-12T14:53:00.000Z	rasmusth	almoxarife	isn't medibuntu added when I install ubuntu?
2011-12-12T14:55:00.000Z	almoxarife	rasmusth	no, you are thinking of another distro that does, but it is not 'ubuntu'
2011-12-12T14:56:00.000Z	almoxarife	rasmusth	no, xbmc wouldn't
2011-12-12T15:08:00.000Z	almoxarife	rasmusth	you can, but the question is how much needs to be edited to get what you want to achieve
2011-12-12T15:08:00.000Z	almoxarife	rasmusth	to what?
2011-12-12T15:09:00.000Z	rasmusth	almoxarife	an application called Airfoil Speakers
2011-12-12T15:11:00.000Z	almoxarife	rasmusth	what version? ubuntu
2011-12-12T15:12:00.000Z	almoxarife	rasmusth	/usr/share/applications has all the .desktop files for gui'fied apps, you could change it there?
2011-12-12T15:13:00.000Z	rasmusth	almoxarife	I tried adding the parameter to the Exec line nothing happens when I try to launch with that at all
2011-12-12T15:14:00.000Z	almoxarife	rasmusth	I don't know what to tell you, run it via terminal, look for errors?
2011-12-12T15:38:00.000Z	almoxarife	rasmusth	have a batt?
2011-12-12T15:38:00.000Z	rasmusth	almoxarife	no
2011-12-12T15:39:00.000Z	almoxarife	rasmusth	ohh :(
2011-12-12T17:47:00.000Z	almoxarife	rasmusth	that's a bug, i see the same thing and mine is in use, google it
2011-12-12T17:48:00.000Z	rasmusth	almoxarife	I dont understand why xbmc would use 100% cpu in menu then
2011-12-12T17:52:00.000Z	almoxarife	rasmusth	can't say, I don't see the same cpu hogging, btw, does xbmc see the gpu?
2011-12-12T17:53:00.000Z	rasmusth	almoxarife	no
2011-12-12T17:54:00.000Z	almoxarife	rasmusth	do you have the bios option to force the gpu rather the onboard? assuming you have that setup?
