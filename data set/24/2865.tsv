2008-10-09T15:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hml	after finding the PID, use ps -ef | grep <name>

2008-12-01T15:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hml	what are you trying to achieve?
2008-12-01T15:45:00.000Z	hml	ActionParsnip	record streaming videos to watch offline
2008-12-01T15:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hml	is it a flash video?
2008-12-01T15:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hml	if its realplayer typed then: http://thomer.com/howtos/capture_realstream.html will help, i'd imagine the syntax is similar for other formats
2008-12-01T15:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hml	you need to make sure mplayer can actually play the file first
2008-12-01T15:48:00.000Z	hml	ActionParsnip	no no, I have to use vlc; I know how to dump with mplayer; i'm trying to find the equiv commanddd with vlc :-)
