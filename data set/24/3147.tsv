2008-04-21T21:59:00.000Z	Pici	vova_kubba	Have you checked your mixer levels? using alsamixer or a gui alternative?
2008-04-21T21:59:00.000Z	vova_kubba	Pici	yes, i done it more times, i uped all levels but nothing happen
2008-04-21T22:00:00.000Z	Pici	vova_kubba	Are you sure that the levels are not muted?
2008-04-21T22:01:00.000Z	vova_kubba	Pici	mm.. how i can chek it? all levels are uped
2008-04-21T22:01:00.000Z	Pici	vova_kubba	If a line is muted, it will show MM on its mixer bar.

2008-04-21T22:09:00.000Z	Pici	vova_kubba	Yes, this was the last thing I said: If a line is muted, it will show MM on its mixer bar.
2008-04-21T22:10:00.000Z	vova_kubba	Pici	and i answer that all levels are uped but what as for muted... how i can chek it?
2008-04-21T22:11:00.000Z	Pici	vova_kubba	If it is muted, on the mixer bars in alsamixer, where it would normally say 00, it shows MM
