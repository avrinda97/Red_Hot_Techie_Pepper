2005-12-14T13:48:00.000Z	floppyears		I would test your ram, and your livecd
2005-12-14T13:48:00.000Z	floppyears		to make sure that those are not the problem
2005-12-14T08:03:00.000Z	floppyears		hi
2005-12-14T08:03:00.000Z	floppyears		how can I use tar
2005-12-14T08:03:00.000Z	floppyears		to move my linux setup from /hdb2 to /hda7
2005-12-14T08:03:00.000Z	kbrooks	floppyears	to do what? um
2005-12-14T08:04:00.000Z	kbrooks		that really isnt a suitable usage of tar
2005-12-14T08:04:00.000Z	floppyears	kbrooks	I want to move my linux setup from one partition to another by using tar
2005-12-14T08:04:00.000Z	floppyears		tar -cf /mnt/hdb7/ | tar -xp
2005-12-14T08:04:00.000Z	floppyears		but it's not working :(
2005-12-14T08:04:00.000Z	kbrooks	floppyears	after you have "moved" the linux setup, you still have a lot to do
2005-12-14T08:05:00.000Z	floppyears	kbrooks	I have used tar  before, but can't remember the specific command
2005-12-14T08:05:00.000Z	kbrooks	floppyears	add -, and add - to the end of the pipe
2005-12-14T08:07:00.000Z	floppyears	kbrooks	thanks it's working now :)
2005-12-14T08:12:00.000Z	kbrooks		floppyears,
2005-12-14T08:12:00.000Z	kbrooks	floppyears	ping
2005-12-14T08:12:00.000Z	kbrooks	floppyears	there?
2005-12-14T08:12:00.000Z	kbrooks	floppyears	btw
2005-12-14T08:12:00.000Z	kbrooks	floppyears	explicit is better than implicit
2005-12-14T08:13:00.000Z	floppyears	kbrooks	what ?
2005-12-14T08:13:00.000Z	kbrooks	floppyears	tar doesnt guess
2005-12-14T08:13:00.000Z	floppyears	kbrooks	what do you mean?
2005-12-14T08:14:00.000Z	kbrooks	floppyears	explicit is better than implicit -- tar does not guess if you want to compress to stdin or not. without a "file" that can be written to, or read from, error
2005-12-14T08:14:00.000Z	floppyears	kbrooks	yes, that's what I'm using. I have mounted them under two different directies within /mnt
