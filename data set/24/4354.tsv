2009-06-06T12:17:00.000Z	Gnea		nope, just a config file - make a dir, point it at it, startit up, and it should "just work", as long as the config is set correctly

2009-06-06T12:23:00.000Z	areels	Gnea	nvidia is making problem
2009-06-06T12:23:00.000Z	Gnea	areels	how so?
2009-06-06T12:25:00.000Z	areels	Gnea	 Option         "metamodes" "1920x1080 +0+0; nvidia-auto-select +0+0"
2009-06-06T12:25:00.000Z	Gnea	areels	so you're editting xorg.conf?
2009-06-06T12:26:00.000Z	Gnea	areels	why don't you use the nvidia-settings tool?
2009-06-06T12:27:00.000Z	areels	Gnea	i'm using it but it doesn't remember settings, always goes to start
2009-06-06T12:35:00.000Z	Gnea	areels	have you tried resetting your config and following the instructions at the website I had ubottu give you?
2009-06-06T12:37:00.000Z	Gnea	areels	it doesn't?
2009-06-06T12:37:00.000Z	Gnea	areels	how did you type it?
2009-06-06T12:38:00.000Z	Gnea	areels	$ is part of the prompt, not the command
2009-06-06T12:38:00.000Z	Gnea	areels	the command is:  xrandr
2009-06-06T12:38:00.000Z	areels	Gnea	 i did this xrandr --output LVDS --mode 1920x1080 is it done now?
2009-06-06T12:39:00.000Z	Gnea	areels	I have no idea. different setups will have a different output
2009-06-06T12:39:00.000Z	Gnea	areels	that's why I run xrandr by itself to see what it finds
2009-06-06T12:40:00.000Z	Gnea	areels	if it did work, the resolution would change - the point behind xrandr is to control the resolution from the commandline - it's not writing to a file
2009-06-06T13:29:00.000Z	Gnea	areels	#winehq would be a more appropriate place to ask
2009-06-06T13:30:00.000Z	Gnea	areels	it can be tricky
