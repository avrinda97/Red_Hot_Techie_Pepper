2006-02-24T17:38:00.000Z	Half-Left	concept10	I used a startup script for Xgl in that thread somewhere
2006-02-24T17:39:00.000Z	concept10	Half-Left	any major bugs for you?  I play one game, I just want that to work. (True combat, based on Wolf ET)
2006-02-24T17:40:00.000Z	Half-Left	concept10	well it's experimental but games dont exactly work right sometimes, but it's easy enough to switch back to X
2006-02-24T17:42:00.000Z	Half-Left	concept10	having the right config OpenGL things will be ok but the wrong config and it will crash Xgl
2006-02-24T17:43:00.000Z	concept10	Half-Left	alright, i will give it a shot.  if it doesnt work, a fresh install wouldnt hurt.  Ive been on this one since Warty
2006-02-24T17:48:00.000Z	concept10	Half-Left	is that a ATI card you have?
2006-02-24T17:48:00.000Z	Half-Left	concept10	nope, nvidia
2006-02-24T17:49:00.000Z	concept10	Half-Left	alright, my laptop has an ATI card, I dont know if im using the non-free drivers or not, but I never installed them
2006-02-24T17:49:00.000Z	Half-Left	concept10	dont know much about ATI
