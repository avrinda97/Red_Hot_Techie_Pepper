2010-07-01T18:06:00.000Z	achilles		is there a way other than network service to set an IP address for a nic ?
2010-07-01T18:07:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	achilles	static ip
2010-07-01T18:07:00.000Z	achilles	ZykoticK9	I set static configuration but it keeps changing
2010-07-01T18:07:00.000Z	achilles	ZykoticK9	keeps "reset" to non configuration
2010-07-01T18:08:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	achilles	no idea then, good luck.
2010-07-01T18:08:00.000Z	achilles	ZykoticK9	thanks
2010-07-01T18:09:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	achilles	you could set static the old fashioned way but it will prevent network manager from using the nic -- research the file /etc/network/interfaces
2010-07-01T18:09:00.000Z	achilles	ZykoticK9	yes I want to stop the network manager, and leave it to interfaces way, how could I ?
2010-07-01T18:10:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	achilles	i haven't done it in a long time but the file in /etc/network/interfaces
2010-07-01T18:10:00.000Z	achilles	ZykoticK9	I have configurations in this file, and I want the only way of configuring interfaces,
2010-07-01T18:11:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	achilles	as soon as that file is controlling the NIC - Network Manager will give an error "Not Managed"
2010-07-01T18:11:00.000Z	achilles	ZykoticK9	yes this is the issue, I don't want Network manager to has any role of it
2010-07-01T18:12:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	achilles	once you have the configuration correctly set up use interfaces, then Network Manager won't control the nic as you want!  You're on the correct path :)
2010-07-01T18:13:00.000Z	achilles	ZykoticK9	I keep feeling the network manager is ruining the whole thing
2010-07-01T18:14:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	achilles	it should say "Not Managed" for the nic you are trying to configure with /etc/network/interfaces
2010-07-01T18:14:00.000Z	achilles	ZykoticK9	it doesn't :)
2010-07-01T18:14:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	achilles	could you pastebin your /etc/netowrk/interaces file?
2010-07-01T18:16:00.000Z	achilles	ZykoticK9	http://pastebin.org/370238
2010-07-01T18:19:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	achilles	I COULD BE WRONG but i don't think you should have "auto eth0", "auto eth1" and "auto eth2" as this says to use DHCP on those interfaces.  I don't even know what "auto eth1:1" with x.x.x.x for IP address is!
2010-07-01T18:19:00.000Z	achilles	ZykoticK9	 auto doesn't mean dhcp, I think it means auto configure
2010-07-01T18:20:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	achilles	doesn't that mean dhcp!
2010-07-01T18:20:00.000Z	achilles	ZykoticK9	static is the keyword for not dhcp
2010-07-01T18:22:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	achilles	looks like Night_Elf might be more knowledgeable then me :)  Good luck guy, gotta go.  Happy Canada Day to any Canucks out there!
2010-07-01T18:23:00.000Z	achilles	ZykoticK9	thank you! happy day
