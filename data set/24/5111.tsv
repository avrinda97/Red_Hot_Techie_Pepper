2006-10-24T14:03:00.000Z	VanessaE		it would keep what you set from being erased.
2006-10-24T14:03:00.000Z	VanessaE		in the mean time, try google to see if there's a more "proper" fix (like an obscure setting or something)
2006-10-24T14:04:00.000Z	VanessaE		Ninja: using the official nvidia driver?
2006-10-24T14:05:00.000Z	VanessaE		!vbc
2006-10-24T14:05:00.000Z	VanessaE		ah
2006-10-24T14:05:00.000Z	VanessaE		!vnc
2006-10-24T14:06:00.000Z	VanessaE		could also be the driver - maybe it isn't compatible with suspend/hibernate
2006-10-24T14:06:00.000Z	VanessaE		I remember people having issues with that in the past.
2006-10-24T14:07:00.000Z	VanessaE		Shaun: I do that periodically on my desktop.  try   sudo apt-get -f install
2006-10-24T14:07:00.000Z	VanessaE		see if that works out the dependency issue.
2006-10-24T14:08:00.000Z	ShaunES_	VanessaE	Crashes out.
2006-10-24T14:09:00.000Z	ShaunES_	VanessaE	courier-authlib-userdb: Depends: courier-authlib but it is not installable, courier-base: Depends: courier-authlib but it is not installable
2006-10-24T14:10:00.000Z	ShaunES_	VanessaE	Yeah.
2006-10-24T14:12:00.000Z	ShaunES_	VanessaE	I can't uninstall, since the dependencies are missing.
2006-10-24T14:13:00.000Z	ShaunES_	VanessaE	sudo apt-get -f remove courier-base ?
2006-10-24T14:15:00.000Z	ShaunES_	VanessaE	With which command?
2006-10-24T14:16:00.000Z	ShaunES_	VanessaE	gives me dependency errors.
2006-10-24T14:24:00.000Z	ShaunES_	VanessaE	dpkg: need an action option
2006-10-24T14:26:00.000Z	ShaunES_	VanessaE	invoke-rc.d: initscript courier-authdaemon, action "stop" failed.
2006-10-24T14:29:00.000Z	ShaunES_	VanessaE	Still errors, subprocess new pre-removal script returned error exit status 1 and more!
2006-10-24T14:32:00.000Z	ShaunES_	VanessaE	Yeah.
2006-10-24T14:38:00.000Z	ShaunES_	VanessaE	I think we've fixed it...
2006-10-24T14:40:00.000Z	ShaunES_	VanessaE	Yeah, installed it, then a few dependencies, now I'm upgrading so the versions are compatible with the new ones.
2006-10-24T14:41:00.000Z	ShaunES_	VanessaE	Fixed it, you legend :D
