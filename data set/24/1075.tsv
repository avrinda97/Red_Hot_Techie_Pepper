2010-07-28T16:10:00.000Z	b43confused		i have no access

2010-07-28T16:12:00.000Z	ikonia	b43confused	try not to press enter for every few words, type what you want to say, then press enter
2010-07-28T16:12:00.000Z	b43confused	ikonia	but it is not making sense to me  (i am NOT a good sysadmin)
2010-07-28T16:12:00.000Z	ikonia		!Broadcom
2010-07-28T16:12:00.000Z	ikonia	b43confused	checkout that link
2010-07-28T16:13:00.000Z	b43confused		thanks for the help on the link but i can't run apt-get or wget or anything like this because i have no ethernet.  i have to install all files from a USB
2010-07-28T16:13:00.000Z	ikonia	b43confused	download the packages manually, then install them
2010-07-28T16:14:00.000Z	ikonia	b43confused	is there a reason you can't use the ethernet to resolve this ?
