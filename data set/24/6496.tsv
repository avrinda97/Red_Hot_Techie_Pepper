2008-10-17T13:48:00.000Z	bonk		hey.. is there a fix for the constant crashing of firefox when entering flash sites?
2008-10-17T13:48:00.000Z	soundray	bonk	make sure you haven't got a competing flash plugin, like gnash
2008-10-17T13:57:00.000Z	soundray	bonk	no, you shouldn't remove flashplugin-nonfree
2008-10-17T13:58:00.000Z	soundray	bonk	check whether you have gnash installed, and if so, remove that. Then restart firefox and see if it is still crashing.
2008-10-17T14:00:00.000Z	soundray	bonk	in firefox, open about:plugins as the URL and see if you have enabled any flash plugins other than libflashplayer.so
2008-10-17T14:03:00.000Z	bonk	soundray	yeah "FutureSplash Player", so delete?
2008-10-17T14:03:00.000Z	soundray	bonk	yes
2008-10-17T14:21:00.000Z	bonk	soundray	futuresplash isn't in synaptic nor can it be found in apt-get remove, I did "locate libflash" and maybe it's part of Opera "/usr/lib/opera/plugins/libflashplayer.so" how do I remove this one do you know?
2008-10-17T14:30:00.000Z	soundray	bonk	you must have installed it from within firefox, so that's how you remove it, too.
2008-10-17T14:32:00.000Z	bonk	soundray	like preferences->addons->plugins?
2008-10-17T14:33:00.000Z	soundray	bonk	could be
2008-10-17T14:37:00.000Z	soundray	bonk	what's the filename for futuresplash? It should say on the about:plugins page
2008-10-17T14:38:00.000Z	bonk	soundray	it says libflashplayer.so
2008-10-17T14:39:00.000Z	soundray	bonk	the futuresplash one?
2008-10-17T14:39:00.000Z	soundray	bonk	I see what you mean. We've been barking up the wrong tree.
2008-10-17T14:41:00.000Z	soundray	bonk	how many sections are there in your about:plugins page? (A section being one that starts with a headline like "Shockwave Flash" and ends with that grey table.
2008-10-17T14:42:00.000Z	soundray	bonk	there should be at least one other section with a title of "Default Plugin".
2008-10-17T14:42:00.000Z	bonk	soundray	yeah, that is empty
2008-10-17T14:43:00.000Z	soundray	bonk	*how many* of these sections do you have?
2008-10-17T14:45:00.000Z	bonk	soundray	here is a snap http://img520.imageshack.us/my.php?image=flashnh9.jpg
2008-10-17T14:46:00.000Z	soundray	bonk	that doesn't show what I need to see. Can you highlight the entire page and paste it to http://paste.ubuntu.com please
2008-10-17T14:48:00.000Z	bonk	soundray	http://paste.ubuntu.com/58741/
2008-10-17T14:53:00.000Z	bonk	soundray	if the text is unclear here's the image: http://img380.imageshack.us/my.php?image=flashlf8.jpg
2008-10-17T14:54:00.000Z	soundray	bonk	can't see any conflicts, so that's not the problem, sorry.
