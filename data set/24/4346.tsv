2007-05-01T07:33:00.000Z	ch296		ant: it's defaulted to gij, which is the open source version and it's giving me a GUI error while running a class file
2007-05-01T07:35:00.000Z	ch296		ant: I used to, it's still installed, but I stopped using it
2007-05-01T07:36:00.000Z	ch296		ant: ... the java command is now a link to the gij program
2007-05-01T07:37:00.000Z	ch296		ant: I did an apt-get on java6 but that didn't change that
2007-05-01T07:37:00.000Z	ch296		ant: no, should I do apt-get install sun-java5-bin?
2007-05-01T07:38:00.000Z	ch296		ant: ok, let me give that a shot
2007-05-01T07:38:00.000Z	ch296		ant: yes
2007-05-01T07:40:00.000Z	ch296		ant: that didn't do it
2007-05-01T07:40:00.000Z	ch296		ant: java is still linked to gij
2007-05-01T07:41:00.000Z	ch296		ant: yeah, thanks anyway, appreciate it
2007-05-01T07:43:00.000Z	MikeJC	ch296	what problem are you having with java? I wasn't following.
2007-05-01T07:44:00.000Z	ch296	MikeJC	hi, I'm trying to run the official JRE, however, typing java in shell is invoking gij instead
2007-05-01T07:45:00.000Z	MikeJC	ch296	: it is a path thing.  Try something like "export PATH=/usr/java/bin/:$PATH" and then "java -version"
2007-05-01T07:47:00.000Z	ch296	MikeJC	gij is still showing
2007-05-01T07:48:00.000Z	MikeJC	ch296	: can you tell where java 5 (or 6) is installed?  It is usually in /usr/java/, but it might be else where.
2007-05-01T07:48:00.000Z	ch296	MikeJC	wait... I don't have /usr/java directory
2007-05-01T07:49:00.000Z	ch296	MikeJC	I just reinstall java5 JRE
2007-05-01T07:53:00.000Z	MikeJC	ch296	you somehow have to find out where java is getting installed to.  /opt/java?  apt should be able to tell you.
2007-05-01T07:54:00.000Z	MikeJC	ch296	try ls of /opt, one system here is /opt/jdk1.6.0/
2007-05-01T07:55:00.000Z	ch296	MikeJC	thanks, give me a sec
2007-05-01T07:57:00.000Z	ch296	MikeJC	ls/Opt only doesn't show java
2007-05-01T07:59:00.000Z	ch296	MikeJC	I found java! it's in /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.5.0-sun-1.5.0.11/bin/java
2007-05-01T07:59:00.000Z	ch296	MikeJC	so I know how to invoke it now, thanks for your help
2007-05-01T07:59:00.000Z	MikeJC	ch296	np, enjoy
