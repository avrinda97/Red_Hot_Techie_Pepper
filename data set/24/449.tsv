2011-09-05T07:40:00.000Z	kolix		i bouhgt the domain off onednr
2011-09-05T07:41:00.000Z	Jokn	kolix	if you're wanting to setup an A record then do it with your dns host.
2011-09-05T07:41:00.000Z	kolix	Jokn	so besides the actual purchase of the domain name i have to set up a dns host too?
2011-09-05T07:41:00.000Z	kolix		**purchase
2011-09-05T07:42:00.000Z	Jokn	kolix	you may not have to purchase it, depends on the registrar.  Also if you have webhosting, a lot of hosts will provide DNS hosting.
2011-09-05T07:42:00.000Z	kolix		no rented servers. I'm running apache on my machine
2011-09-05T07:43:00.000Z	Jokn	kolix	check if onednr has dns hosting
2011-09-05T07:43:00.000Z	Jokn	kolix	or run your own DNS server, bind.  I'd recommend using the service you have though if its free.
2011-09-05T07:49:00.000Z	kolix	Jokn	I'm using onednr.com...I've tried calling them but noone picked up...
2011-09-05T07:49:00.000Z	kolix		i don't know if they do dns hosting or not
2011-09-05T07:50:00.000Z	Jokn	kolix	look in the user control panel, see if you can find anything for DNS hosting otherwise host your own bind server.
2011-09-05T07:50:00.000Z	Jokn	kolix	and then you'll go in and point the domain to your server as the name server
2011-09-05T07:55:00.000Z	kolix		ok
2011-09-05T07:55:00.000Z	kolix		thse are my options

2011-09-05T07:57:00.000Z	Jokn	kolix	that looks like they're updating the name servers only
2011-09-05T07:58:00.000Z	kolix		ok
2011-09-05T07:58:00.000Z	kolix	Jokn	i guess i'll wait for their return call and ask them
2011-09-05T07:58:00.000Z	kolix	Jokn	thanks again for helping
2011-09-05T08:01:00.000Z	Jokn	kolix	no problem.  As a last resort look into bind server.  I'd recommend finding somebody to host your DNS until you're more familiar with DNS though.
