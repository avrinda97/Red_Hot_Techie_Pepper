2010-03-28T16:49:00.000Z	riktking		got issues with a fat32 partition, need to mount it as RW for SAMBA access
2010-03-28T16:50:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	riktking	check mount first to see if its mounted as rw
2010-03-28T16:50:00.000Z	riktking	hatake_kakashi	how do i do that?
2010-03-28T16:51:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	riktking	its a console command, which can be done by going through terminal
2010-03-28T16:51:00.000Z	riktking	hatake_kakashi	ok
2010-03-28T16:51:00.000Z	riktking	hatake_kakashi	whats the command
2010-03-28T16:52:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	riktking	mount
2010-03-28T16:52:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	riktking	if you're going to paste, don't paste in here use pastebin

2010-03-28T16:54:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	riktking	ok its mounted as read write, now read this: https://help.ubuntu.com/9.10/serverguide/C/samba-fileserver.html#samba-fileserver-configuration
2010-03-28T16:54:00.000Z	riktking	hatake_kakashi	thanks
2010-03-28T16:55:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	riktking	no worries
2010-03-28T16:55:00.000Z	riktking	hatake_kakashi	i have tried to follow that
2010-03-28T16:55:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	riktking	so where are you stuck?
2010-03-28T16:56:00.000Z	riktking	hatake_kakashi	basically i have the folders shared, but i cant write to them via samba from either a windows machine or a ubuntu one
2010-03-28T16:56:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	riktking	ok I need you to paste your smb.conf
2010-03-28T16:56:00.000Z	riktking		ok
2010-03-28T16:56:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	riktking	err pastebin
2010-03-28T16:57:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi		!pastebin | rabbit1
2010-03-28T16:58:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi		there's !pastebinit
2010-03-28T17:00:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi		you can use pastebinit to quickly paste stuff even from dmesg
2010-03-28T17:04:00.000Z	riktking	hatake_kakashi	http://pastebin.com/kdCjQRuV is my smb.conf
2010-03-28T17:06:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	riktking	seems like only printer is shared or the actual share for your FAT32 is not visible in that paste
