2009-05-15T01:33:00.000Z	ehs1	Piet	Here you go :) http://paste.ubuntu.com/172588/
2009-05-15T01:34:00.000Z	Piet	ehs1	ok, what about the error message?
2009-05-15T01:36:00.000Z	ehs1	Piet	I'm using the gparted gui, so there's no error. it just won't let me increase the size, goes back to the previous max size if i make it higher
2009-05-15T01:37:00.000Z	Piet	ehs1	try doing it the way i suggested it would need to be done, step by step, then.
2009-05-15T01:37:00.000Z	Piet	ehs1	i.e. start by swapping the windows recovery partition and the unallocated space.
2009-05-15T01:37:00.000Z	Piet	ehs1	of course, before you start this, make sure you have current backups.
2009-05-15T01:37:00.000Z	ehs1	Piet	Well, the windows recovery partition is actually at the end
2009-05-15T01:38:00.000Z	ehs1	Piet	I think it may be easier to simply make the new partition. i don't have much time to work on this anyways, it's not my pc and i will have to leave in a couple hours
2009-05-15T01:39:00.000Z	ehs1	Piet	I'm a noob helping out a bigger noob :P
2009-05-15T01:39:00.000Z	ehs1	Piet	but thanks for all your help, i'll look up how to edit the fstab file like u said
2009-05-15T01:39:00.000Z	Piet	ehs1	alright, then do it. you'll want to mount this new partition to /home most likely, so you'll need to add a line saying so to the linux' /etc/fstab
2009-05-15T01:39:00.000Z	ehs1	Piet	ok. thanks a lot :)
2009-05-15T01:40:00.000Z	Piet	ehs1	also, you'll want to copy all data from your current /home/ directory onto this new partition , so you can still access it after mounting the new file system to /home
2009-05-15T01:42:00.000Z	ehs1	Piet	It's a brand new installation, so copying the data shouldn't be necessary. Unless I'm missing something? I did install nvidia drivers, but quite sure they don't get installed in /home
2009-05-15T01:43:00.000Z	Piet	ehs1	if you haven't used it much and have not stored files on your desktop or in your home directory it's probably fine.
2009-05-15T01:44:00.000Z	Piet	ehs1	you will loose a very little bit of space only
2009-05-15T01:44:00.000Z	ehs1	Piet	Just installed an hour ago :D. already ran out of space with just 2gb allocated on install
2009-05-15T01:45:00.000Z	Piet	ehs1	hmm, that is veeery little, and unfortunately i don't think what you'Re going to do now will fix this issue.
2009-05-15T01:46:00.000Z	Piet	ehs1	for a system with a grapical desktop, you should allocate more like >= 7 gigs
2009-05-15T01:46:00.000Z	Piet	ehs1	and the data you store in /home adds to this.
2009-05-15T01:46:00.000Z	ehs1	Piet	I didn't specify, i just let ubuntu go with defaults, and i never knew it would allocate so little
2009-05-15T01:47:00.000Z	Piet	ehs1	it probably did that since there was no more available ;-)
2009-05-15T01:47:00.000Z	ehs1	Piet	No, this pc had 100+ Gb free... so that's not it
2009-05-15T01:50:00.000Z	Piet	ehs1	i was referring to unallocated space, you too?
