2009-03-26T11:50:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Skapare	Ubuntu doesn't have a 'root' password
2009-03-26T11:50:00.000Z	Skapare	IntuitiveNipple	I'm doing this WITH Ubuntu, not from Ubuntu
2009-03-26T11:58:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Skapare	You can install 'raw' using debootstrap
2009-03-26T11:59:00.000Z	Skapare	IntuitiveNipple	I don't understand how that helps me
2009-03-26T11:59:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Skapare	I can point you to an article I wrote on how to do it with user-mode linux - I often use the same process for chroot's or raw VM images too.
2009-03-26T11:59:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Skapare	It is the way we create bootable images from scratch
2009-03-26T12:01:00.000Z	Skapare	IntuitiveNipple	if I "tear apart" the Ubuntu ISO image, I should see a kernel it brings up ... that kernel will eventually mount the CD filesystem ... and maybe further mounts after that ... and maybe initramfs or initrd in between ... if I knew what that first step was, I could make a flash stick with grub and the kernel from the ISO and maybe get it to mount the flash stick partition
2009-03-26T12:02:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Skapare	You should look at the 'casper' package - that's the live-image booter
2009-03-26T12:02:00.000Z	Skapare	IntuitiveNipple	a source package?
2009-03-26T12:03:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Skapare	all ubuntu packages are available from source as well as as installable binaries.
2009-03-26T12:03:00.000Z	Skapare	IntuitiveNipple	I'm just trying to transform the ubuntu ISO into a form that will boot on a USB flash stick
2009-03-26T12:05:00.000Z	Skapare	IntuitiveNipple	I know how to build an image that could just self boot from either a CD/DVD or from a hard drive, without any change whatsoever ... just "dd" to a hard drive, or to a flash stick ... or "cdrecord" it to a CD or DVD ... and it will be bootable ... maybe a future Ubuntu should do this
2009-03-26T12:05:00.000Z	Skapare	IntuitiveNipple	e.g. one image ... boots either way
2009-03-26T12:06:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Skapare	the live-CD ISO? There's a tool that does that in Jaunty, and I believe Intrepid, available by default from the System > Administration menu.
2009-03-26T12:07:00.000Z	Skapare	IntuitiveNipple	yeah, but if I take the ISO and just "dd" it to a USB flash stick, that isn't bootable ... I could make one that is
2009-03-26T12:09:00.000Z	Skapare	IntuitiveNipple	but being able to make an image that can boot as a CD/DVD or can boot as a hard disk ... doesn't mean I can make it bring up ubuntu's system
2009-03-26T12:10:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Skapare	As long as it boot-straps the casper images it'll boot
2009-03-26T12:12:00.000Z	Skapare	IntuitiveNipple	well, see, I don't know even what "casper images" is ... when Linux boots up, it either mounts a filesystem and runs an init program ... or loads an initramfs or initrd image and runs /linuxrc ... or other variations ... what it does from there is up to however ubuntu is built
2009-03-26T12:13:00.000Z	Skapare	IntuitiveNipple	FYI, I have built embedded Linux systems, including cable TV set top boxes ... I know the fundamentals ... I just don't know the Ubuntu specifics
2009-03-26T12:13:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Skapare	So go look then. I explained earlier that 'casper' is how Ubuntu handles live images. It includes boot scripts that set-up the correct environment and so forth.
2009-03-26T12:14:00.000Z	Skapare	IntuitiveNipple	there's a gap in that ... I need a documentation on this casper images ... to know how it makes the kernel get to it
2009-03-26T12:14:00.000Z	Skapare	IntuitiveNipple	what the casper images then do I won't need to know ... I just need to know how to get it that stage
2009-03-26T12:15:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Skapare	http://packages.ubuntu.com/intrepid/casper
2009-03-26T12:17:00.000Z	Skapare	IntuitiveNipple	OK ... thanks ... I'll download its source tomorrow and see what docs are inside to figure it out ... it appears I need to create the context to start that program somehow
