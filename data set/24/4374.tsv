2007-04-27T15:23:00.000Z	neverblue		why does a .php file, after a new install, attempt to get dled by FF and not run in the browser?
2007-04-27T15:24:00.000Z	kane77	neverblue	have you installed the php lib for apache?
2007-04-27T15:25:00.000Z	kane77	neverblue	if yes try this "sudo a2enmod php4" (if you have php5 then php5)
2007-04-27T15:25:00.000Z	kane77	neverblue	then restart apache
2007-04-27T15:26:00.000Z	kane77	neverblue	(sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart)
2007-04-27T15:26:00.000Z	kane77	neverblue	enable the php mod
2007-11-22T22:22:00.000Z	kane77	neverblue	I made a script and put it into rc.local
2007-11-22T22:23:00.000Z	kane77	neverblue	that is /etc/rc.local
2007-11-22T22:23:00.000Z	neverblue	kane77	a script ? hmmm
2007-11-22T22:23:00.000Z	kane77	neverblue	with all the iptable commands...
2007-11-22T22:25:00.000Z	kane77	neverblue	I believe so.. do you have any better place for it? :)
2007-11-22T22:25:00.000Z	neverblue	kane77	I do not have enough knowledge about linux to answer that question correctly
2007-11-22T22:28:00.000Z	kane77	neverblue	well just create file starting with #!/bin/bash put all the iptables commands you want.. and save it as <name>.sh use "chmod +x <name>.sh" to make it runnable and then edit /etc/rc.local and put the name of the file there (with complete path to the file)..
2007-11-22T22:29:00.000Z	kane77	neverblue	of course replace <name> with desired name :)
2007-11-22T22:29:00.000Z	neverblue	kane77	is it really that easy though ?
2007-11-22T22:29:00.000Z	kane77	neverblue	sure

2007-11-22T22:33:00.000Z	kane77	neverblue	use iptables-save and iptables-restore...
