2007-01-27T09:03:00.000Z	threeonefour	Leumas	what i mean is once you get the clients booted you might have problems with java and flash. i have only booted 84 clients successfully with edubuntu and i ran into those problems
2007-01-27T09:04:00.000Z	Leumas	threeonefour	iah, ok, ... but now i even can't load the kernel :(

2007-01-27T09:06:00.000Z	Leumas	threeonefour	just 5 for now
2007-01-27T09:06:00.000Z	Leumas	threeonefour	i'm only making probes
2007-01-27T09:06:00.000Z	threeonefour	Leumas	go one at a time first off
2007-01-27T09:06:00.000Z	threeonefour	Leumas	and upgrad to ltsp 5
2007-01-27T09:06:00.000Z	Leumas	threeonefour	yeah, i'm trying only one
2007-01-27T09:08:00.000Z	Leumas	threeonefour	but the client can't load the ltsp kernel, only load pxelinux.0
2007-01-27T09:09:00.000Z	threeonefour	Leumas	yes i know   but when you upgrade to the newest ltsp 5 it will give you a new kernal or should at least
2007-01-27T09:09:00.000Z	Leumas	threeonefour	ok thnks
