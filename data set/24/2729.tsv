2009-10-04T06:04:00.000Z	Hodapp		hmm. guess nobody has any clue about CUPS.
2009-10-04T06:05:00.000Z	FiReSTaRT	Hodapp	would you mind repeating the question.. i'm no expert but i've used its web interface to config both local and network printers
2009-10-04T06:06:00.000Z	Hodapp	FiReSTaRT	CUPS is very clearly running; I can see this with /etc/init.d/cups and by looking at 127.0.0.1:631. But "Default Printers" says "The CUPS scheduler is not running" and no applications seem to see a printer.
2009-10-04T06:07:00.000Z	Hodapp	FiReSTaRT	any clue?
2009-10-04T06:08:00.000Z	FiReSTaRT	Hodapp	that's weird.. let's start with which printer you're using and how you installed the drivers
2009-10-04T06:08:00.000Z	Hodapp	FiReSTaRT	It's a printer on the network. I set it up through the web interface at 127.0.0.1:631 and pointed it to the network printer (which is also shared via
2009-10-04T06:08:00.000Z	Hodapp	FiReSTaRT	er, via CUPS). I can print test pages from the web interface with no trouble.
2009-10-04T06:09:00.000Z	FiReSTaRT	Hodapp	out of curiosity, what's the make and model?
2009-10-04T06:10:00.000Z	Hodapp	FiReSTaRT	It's a Brother HL1240. But that should not matter, as this issue persists whether or not CUPS even has a printer present.
2009-10-04T06:10:00.000Z	FiReSTaRT	Hodapp	which drivers did you install for it? lpr or cups?
2009-10-04T06:11:00.000Z	Hodapp	FiReSTaRT	"Printer Driver: Brother HL-1240 Foomatic/hl1250 (recommended)"
2009-10-04T06:11:00.000Z	FiReSTaRT	Hodapp	when i stopped using my mfc7440n locally, i downloaded the lpr drivers and installed'em
2009-10-04T06:12:00.000Z	FiReSTaRT	Hodapp	that's your problem lol... hang on.. lemme just double-check but i'd recommend using the brother stock drivers
2009-10-04T06:12:00.000Z	Hodapp	FiReSTaRT	I seriously doubt that's the problem.
2009-10-04T06:13:00.000Z	FiReSTaRT	Hodapp	my recommendation is to remove the foomatic driver (even though it works pretty nicely on the hp printer that i have) and install the brother drivers from their linux page http://solutions.brother.com/linux/en_us/
2009-10-04T06:13:00.000Z	Hodapp	FiReSTaRT	Why do you believe this would help?
2009-10-04T06:14:00.000Z	FiReSTaRT	Hodapp	simply because it worked for me :)
2009-10-04T06:14:00.000Z	Hodapp	FiReSTaRT	Did Ubuntu fail to see that CUPS was running when it was?
2009-10-04T06:14:00.000Z	FiReSTaRT	Hodapp	nope.. never had that happen to me
2009-10-04T06:14:00.000Z	Hodapp		also, that driver doesn't list my printer
2009-10-04T06:15:00.000Z	FiReSTaRT	Hodapp	it was an hl-1240?
2009-10-04T06:15:00.000Z	FiReSTaRT		http://solutions.brother.com/linux/en_us/download_prn.html
2009-10-04T06:15:00.000Z	FiReSTaRT	Hodapp	 http://solutions.brother.com/linux/en_us/download_prn.html#HL-1240
2009-10-04T06:20:00.000Z	FiReSTaRT	Hodapp	ok i'm off to the can, but if you are experiencing any issues after installing the brother stock drivers and need help troubleshooting your issues, shoot me a pm if nobody here can answer your question... i'm more likely to check my pm's than the main channel.. good luck
