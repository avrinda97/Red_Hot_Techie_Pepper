2010-01-28T14:05:00.000Z	Stevethepirate		Hello, weird error here, it seems like a key on my PC (ubuntu 9.10) is being permanently pressed. But its not (continues even when keyboard unplugged). The key that is supposedly pressed is either F, "." or enter... just carries on and on.
2010-01-28T14:05:00.000Z	flaarg	Stevethepirate	clean your keyboard first thing
2010-01-28T14:05:00.000Z	Stevethepirate		Rofl, same thing happens with like 3 keyboards.
2010-01-28T14:06:00.000Z	flaarg	Stevethepirate	does it do it in a livecd?
2010-01-28T14:06:00.000Z	Stevethepirate		That was my first idea ;/
2010-01-28T14:06:00.000Z	flaarg		that sounds like hardware error
2010-01-28T14:06:00.000Z	Stevethepirate	flaarg	New logitech pc's, and I would rather not restart the machine if possible.
2010-01-28T14:06:00.000Z	flaarg	Stevethepirate	does it do it in tty or just in X?
2010-01-28T14:06:00.000Z	Stevethepirate		The box is running x11vnc, but I am not sure why suddenly that would cause this.
2010-01-28T14:06:00.000Z	Stevethepirate		Just on X.
2010-01-28T14:07:00.000Z	flaarg		does restarting X fix it?
2010-01-28T14:07:00.000Z	Stevethepirate		At first I thought it was a user being a bastard and catting on a pipe.
2010-01-28T14:07:00.000Z	Stevethepirate		Um, restarting X does fix it, but after a while it starts up.
2010-01-28T14:08:00.000Z	Stevethepirate		(as in the problem resumes after a while)
2010-01-28T14:08:00.000Z	flaarg	Stevethepirate	it probably is a user being a bastard then
2010-01-28T14:08:00.000Z	Stevethepirate	flaarg	It's not.
2010-01-28T14:08:00.000Z	Stevethepirate		The problem starts like when I am typing on X.
2010-01-28T14:08:00.000Z	Stevethepirate		And w/e key I am pressing, it carries on
2010-01-28T14:08:00.000Z	Stevethepirate		As if it is stuck
2010-01-28T14:08:00.000Z	flaarg		well im sorry I can't help you I have only ever seen that happen because of a cat or a broken/jammed keyboard
2010-01-28T14:09:00.000Z	Stevethepirate	flaarg	ok.
2010-01-28T14:10:00.000Z	flaarg		people use the right alt key?
2010-01-28T14:10:00.000Z	Stevethepirate		Keymap issue or the hardware?
2010-01-28T14:10:00.000Z	Stevethepirate	flaarg	Totally.
