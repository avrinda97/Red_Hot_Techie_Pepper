2009-05-02T07:24:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	coleys	  a few flash sites dont like how i got firefox so 'adblocked' and stuff.. but   they all seem to work for me.
2009-05-04T04:34:00.000Z	coleys	Dr_Willis	Your so patient kudos to you, haha =)
2009-05-04T04:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	coleys	 i agree
2009-05-04T05:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	coleys	 yes it seems that way.
2009-07-04T07:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	coleys	 unetbootin just copies a lot of files to the flash drive and a boot loader (syslinux) i recall...
2009-07-04T07:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	coleys	 delete the files.. or reformat it.
2009-07-04T07:12:00.000Z	coleys	Dr_Willis	Ahh, figured. thanks =)
2009-07-05T03:51:00.000Z	coleys	Dr_Willis	He has two nvidia drivers.
2009-07-05T03:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	coleys	 the more the merrier?
2009-07-05T03:51:00.000Z	coleys	Dr_Willis	Is there something special he needs to do? xx
2009-07-05T03:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	coleys	 you mean 2 cards?
2009-07-05T03:52:00.000Z	coleys	Dr_Willis	Yeah.
2009-07-05T03:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	coleys	 Ive not messed with 2 seperate cards since.. a long time ago.. when nvidia started puttng 2+ outs on their cards. :P
2009-07-05T03:53:00.000Z	coleys	Dr_Willis	For some reason he's getting...  "No resume image, doing normal boot"
2009-07-05T03:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	coleys	 resume image =  a message from teh hibernate/suspend stuff.. I always get that message.. since i nevr use resume/sleep/hibernate..   so thats not anissue. :) sounds like its a driver config/install issue..
2009-07-05T03:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	coleys	 i hope hes not having to use 2 different versions of the nvidia drivers for those cards...
2009-07-09T06:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	coleys	 actually thats about all i know on the topic. My Mac is now a large doorstop..
2009-07-09T06:50:00.000Z	coleys	Dr_Willis	Ubuntu ftw =)
