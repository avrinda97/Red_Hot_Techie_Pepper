2006-08-06T15:55:00.000Z	niall		hey guys could someone name a good alternetive windows/ubuntu poker game
2006-08-06T15:55:00.000Z	dr_willis	niall	 go to freshmeat.net or the 'linux game tome' and serch for games
2006-08-07T10:48:00.000Z	dr_willis	niall	 those are cd/dvd image files.
2006-08-07T10:50:00.000Z	dr_willis	niall	 i seem to recall using k3b to burn cue/bin files.
2008-11-09T14:18:00.000Z	dr_willis	niall	 i find they work better for me under linux.. :) but i guess it depends on whatyou are doing.
2008-11-09T14:19:00.000Z	dr_willis	niall	 it does help when the video card makers pay you to 'certify' their drivers..
2008-11-09T14:19:00.000Z	niall	dr_willis	if you have some advice for me, i'd be very happy. Currently I can only use 3/4ths of my right monitor
2008-11-09T14:19:00.000Z	dr_willis	niall	 what video card? Nvidia?
2008-11-09T14:20:00.000Z	niall	dr_willis	its an aging nvidia which is getting close to being replaced
2008-11-09T14:20:00.000Z	niall	dr_willis	i bought it before i got involved in 'nix
2008-11-09T14:21:00.000Z	dr_willis	niall	 what i normally do.. install the proper nvidia drivers, install nvidia-settings, and nvidia-xconfig.. reboot so its using the drivers.. backup the working xorg.conf, then run  nvidia-settings as root.. tweak the Settings..  if you 'apply' the thing sort of works.. but i MUST MUST MUST restart the X server to get all apps to  work properly after tweaking the xorg.conf with nvidia-settings
2008-11-09T14:22:00.000Z	dr_willis	niall	 if you use nvidia-settings and apply the changes.. the 2nd monitor does work forme.. but not all apps are aware of the nature/twinview setup. so may not work righ till you restart the X server. IS the big issue ive seen
2008-11-09T14:22:00.000Z	niall	dr_willis	good advice, and i did that under Heron and had no problems. since I opted to Ibex, this issue stared
2008-11-09T14:22:00.000Z	dr_willis	niall	 ive not had any issues under ibex  with it. on my... hmm.. nvidia 5500 video card machine. Not trried twinview on the 8800gtsxxx yet.
2008-11-09T14:23:00.000Z	niall	dr_willis	I'm on an 8600, but for some reason X Server cant overwrite my config file
2008-11-09T14:24:00.000Z	dr_willis	niall	 Hmm..  at least nvidia-settins isent core-dumping on you like it was doing during beta. :)
2008-11-09T14:24:00.000Z	niall	dr_willis	touche, its just kind of annoying, its not a big deal.
2008-11-09T14:25:00.000Z	dr_willis	niall	 heres one of my xorg.confs - monitor + tv out - wide screen ->  http://pastebin.com/fec7b5f9
2008-11-09T14:25:00.000Z	dr_willis	niall	 and heres the one i got now.. tv + monitor cloned ->  http://pastebin.com/f32944afc
2008-11-09T14:26:00.000Z	niall	dr_willis	i think my whole issue is my monitors run different resolutions
2008-11-09T14:26:00.000Z	dr_willis	niall	 mine do also.. since one is a tv. :)
2008-11-09T14:26:00.000Z	niall	dr_willis	once again, touche, i'll try your settings, just not at the moment because i've been drinking lol
2008-11-09T14:31:00.000Z	niall	dr_willis	i did, but it didnt look anything trust worthy
