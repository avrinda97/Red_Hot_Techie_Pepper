2009-05-17T13:34:00.000Z	Gnea	stealth-	nah, I see what NewApples is saying
2009-05-17T13:36:00.000Z	Gnea	stealth-	actually, linux *can* get viruses - it's just much more difficult
2009-05-17T13:37:00.000Z	stealth-	Gnea	I know, ive done research :)
2009-05-17T13:37:00.000Z	Gnea	stealth-	I gotta disagree with that statement. if a user downloads to a samba share and it's not scanned and quarantined, then anybody on a windows system could click on it.
2009-05-17T13:38:00.000Z	Gnea	stealth-	viruses don't just automatically 'die faster' in linux - there has to be a scanning method to find and take care of it if that was true
2009-05-17T13:39:00.000Z	Gnea	stealth-	at this point, you're better off admitting you were wrong and that you're just spouting off what someone wrote on some random page or from the bot :)
2009-05-17T13:41:00.000Z	Gnea	stealth-	are you done? now, please direct your attention to www.securityfocus.com and http://packetstormsecurity.org/
2009-05-17T13:41:00.000Z	Gnea	stealth-	and while you're there, please do be looking for things called 'rootkits'
2009-05-17T13:42:00.000Z	stealth-	Gnea	*sigh*. Exploits, rootkits, etc. Thats funny, no viruses. hm... if you havnt noticed. A rootkit is called a rootkit cause its not a virus
2009-05-17T13:44:00.000Z	Gnea	stealth-	hrm, gee, and I wonder what software would be called that protects against such things, as well as viruses intended to target windows and mac systems?  maybe... an anti-virus scanner?!
2009-05-17T13:45:00.000Z	Gnea	stealth-	the point is, you're arguing a pointless argument. just because a factoid "says it's so" doesn't mean that it's blanketly 100% true in all cases.
2009-05-17T13:46:00.000Z	Gnea	stealth-	sometimes we need to make edits to the factoids. blindly relying on them will get you nowhere, fast.
2009-05-17T13:46:00.000Z	stealth-	Gnea	I know, but Ive got enough experience to know its true. I've experimented with linux viruses before. NONE of them worked. But yes, I would like this conversation to end too :)
2009-05-17T13:46:00.000Z	stealth-	Gnea	lol, also. How can I get nowhere fast?
2009-05-17T13:47:00.000Z	Gnea	stealth-	good, then if you're in agreement that 'you' are not 'everyone else', then I do believe that we are done. :)
2009-05-17T13:49:00.000Z	Gnea	stealth-	killall <name>
2009-05-17T13:50:00.000Z	Gnea	stealth-	but you knew that
2009-05-17T13:50:00.000Z	stealth-	Gnea	oh yeah, thanks
2009-05-17T13:50:00.000Z	stealth-	Gnea	lol, no. Im still messing with pstree and top :P
2009-05-17T13:50:00.000Z	Gnea	stealth-	I thought you said you knew what you were talking about ;)
2009-05-17T13:51:00.000Z	Gnea	stealth-	j/k :)
2009-05-17T13:51:00.000Z	stealth-	Gnea	the above was a joke. I get alot into programing, but I still am unfamiliar with some server stuff
2009-05-17T13:51:00.000Z	Gnea	stealth-	it's all good
