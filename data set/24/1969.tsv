2009-08-18T21:37:00.000Z	thiebaude	edbian	i haven't, but in windows one time my home page and desktop was changed
2009-08-18T21:37:00.000Z	edbian	thiebaude	They run rampant in windows ;)
2009-08-18T21:37:00.000Z	thiebaude	edbian	yes very true, on a unsecure OS
2009-08-18T21:38:00.000Z	thiebaude	edbian	thats why nothing windows touches my hard drive
2009-08-21T21:42:00.000Z	thiebaude	edbian	i wish i had the graphics card to run it
2009-08-21T21:43:00.000Z	edbian	thiebaude	I bought an ATI radeon 9550 from tiger for $20 that runs them great!
2009-08-21T21:43:00.000Z	thiebaude	edbian	cool, i love tigerdirect here in N.C
2009-08-21T21:44:00.000Z	edbian	thiebaude	Here in Monmouth, Il (bumble-fuck) things come in 1 day (nothing gets here in 1 day)
2009-11-01T20:04:00.000Z	thiebaude	edbian	no
2009-11-01T20:05:00.000Z	edbian	thiebaude	I didn't think so.  Any suggestions for my problem?
2009-11-01T20:05:00.000Z	thiebaude	edbian	im not sure
2009-11-01T20:06:00.000Z	thiebaude	edbian	you able to boot anything from cd?
2009-11-01T20:07:00.000Z	edbian	thiebaude	I haven't tried booting from a CD but I can read any CD with something written to it just fine.
2009-11-01T20:07:00.000Z	edbian	thiebaude	Just not blank CD's
2009-11-01T20:07:00.000Z	thiebaude	edbian	exactly because nothing is on a blank cd
2009-11-01T20:08:00.000Z	thiebaude	edbian	you have a cd icon whenyou put a cd in?
2009-11-01T20:11:00.000Z	thiebaude	edbian	i got it, im not sure how to fix that
2009-11-01T20:11:00.000Z	thiebaude	edbian	but when you put cd in that has something on it
2009-11-01T20:12:00.000Z	edbian	thiebaude	If I put a CD that has something written to it everything happens normally.  Auto-mounted, icon on desktop, all apps can use it etc etc
2011-03-19T07:02:00.000Z	edbian	thiebaude	or log / log out at least
2011-03-19T07:02:00.000Z	edbian	thiebaude	gnome-panel&
2011-03-19T07:02:00.000Z	edbian	thiebaude	It's probably just easier to restart the machine
