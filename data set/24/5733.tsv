2008-11-22T00:08:00.000Z	luigi		hi, i cannot enter in my webserver apache: it told me "You don't have permission to access / on this server."
2008-11-22T00:08:00.000Z	ikonia	luigi	your webserver root needs to be readable by the www-data user
2008-11-22T00:08:00.000Z	luigi	ikonia	how i could do it??
2008-11-22T00:09:00.000Z	ikonia	luigi	make sure your webserver root is readable by everone or at least readable by the user www-data
2008-11-22T00:10:00.000Z	luigi	ikonia	how i could see that?

2008-11-22T00:14:00.000Z	luigi	ikonia	are you talking about the directory /var/www? it is under root user...

2008-11-22T00:16:00.000Z	luigi	ikonia	found, /var/www is property of ROOT user. full control

2008-11-22T00:17:00.000Z	luigi	ikonia	i should to change this directory /var/www in order to get properties by my user?

2008-11-22T00:22:00.000Z	ikonia	luigi	show me ls -la /var/www in a pastebin
2011-08-14T03:28:00.000Z	ikonia	luigi	it's not supported, it's not a stable platform
2011-08-14T03:29:00.000Z	luigi	ikonia	I know, I know. I'm an archlinux user myself but my friend would love to use Ubuntu with the gnome3 interface. While I know it's not supported, I was hoping I could get a little more advice other than to use that PPA, as last time I tried to use it with a distupgrade it merely rendered the X login session unuseable.
2011-08-14T03:30:00.000Z	ikonia	luigi	so you know it doesn't work with ubuntu.....why are you trying to use it.
2011-08-14T03:31:00.000Z	luigi	ikonia	I know it can be done. I've seen it done before. I just know the way I'm told to do it doesn't work.
2011-08-14T03:31:00.000Z	ikonia	luigi	it can't always be done, it depends on a lot of things, it won't work for everyone
2011-08-14T03:32:00.000Z	luigi	ikonia	Ah, I see. I guess I will just wait for 11.10.
