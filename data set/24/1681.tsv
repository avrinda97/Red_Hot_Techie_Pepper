2010-10-09T06:12:00.000Z	Muelli	plitter	which program? It might be due to the program trying to read from stdin.
2010-10-09T06:12:00.000Z	plitter	Muelli	tested firefox and mplayer for now
2010-10-09T06:13:00.000Z	Muelli	plitter	well. that won't work of course.
2010-10-09T06:13:00.000Z	plitter	Muelli	?? why not?
2010-10-09T06:14:00.000Z	plitter	Muelli	then this guy lied!! http://tips4linux.com/use-at-to-schedule-launching-of-commands-in-linux/
2010-10-09T06:14:00.000Z	Muelli	plitter	well. because mplayer reads from stdin and firefox needs a connection to X.
2010-10-09T06:15:00.000Z	plitter	Muelli	but i hear the sound start with mplayer? hmmm, do you have a workaround for it? or another program i can use?
2010-10-09T06:15:00.000Z	Muelli	plitter	sure. there are tons. i.e. mpg123.
2010-10-09T06:16:00.000Z	Muelli	plitter	hm. maybe mplayer handles not being able to read from stdin. But if you hear sound, why did you say that it "stops"?
2010-10-09T06:17:00.000Z	plitter	Muelli	because i just heard the "beginning" and then it stopped
2010-10-09T06:18:00.000Z	Muelli	plitter	yeah. try mpg123 or in fact, any other thing that doesn't read from stdin while running.
2010-10-09T06:18:00.000Z	Muelli	plitter	you could probably configure mplayer to not read from stdin, but I don't know how to do that.
2010-10-09T06:18:00.000Z	plitter	Muelli	installing mpg123 now
2010-10-09T06:19:00.000Z	plitter	Muelli	 hmm mpg123 is for mpeg only?
2010-10-09T06:36:00.000Z	plitter	Muelli	found another way:D making a bashscript with sleep function!!:D
2010-10-09T06:37:00.000Z	plitter	Muelli	what i do when i should have been sleeping so i can wake up at a certain time:P
2010-10-09T06:37:00.000Z	Muelli	plitter	yeah. next time tell us what you want to achieve :-)
2010-10-09T06:38:00.000Z	plitter	Muelli	thought it was implied:P
2010-10-09T06:38:00.000Z	Muelli	plitter	yeah. that's what people usually think. But most of the times it's not :-)
2010-10-09T06:38:00.000Z	plitter	Muelli	is there a way to say sleep until some time?
2010-10-09T06:39:00.000Z	Muelli	plitter	not that I am aware of. Well. Not easily. You could use smth like Python though. Or write something in bash that get's the minutes until your target time.
2010-10-09T06:41:00.000Z	plitter	Muelli	was thinking about that... k will write something:)
2010-10-09T06:42:00.000Z	Muelli	plitter	might actually be easy using "date". Get the number of seconds for "now" and then the number of seconds for your target time. Then just substract them.
2010-10-09T06:43:00.000Z	plitter	Muelli	ooh thanks:)
