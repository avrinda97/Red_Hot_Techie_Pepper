2012-03-02T21:20:00.000Z	sacarlson		petskull: you might look for synaptic or apt-get peg  to peg to a version to the one you want
2012-03-02T21:21:00.000Z	Petskull	sacarlson	but I want to keep 2.62
2012-03-02T21:21:00.000Z	Petskull		I like using it
2012-03-02T21:21:00.000Z	Petskull		but I only need to open meshes in 2.49 and export them as Ogre meshes
2012-03-02T21:23:00.000Z	sacarlson	Petskull	sorry I think it's pinning not peg http://jaqque.sbih.org/kplug/apt-pinning.html
2012-03-02T21:23:00.000Z	Petskull	sacarlson	but won't that not let me run 2.62?
2012-03-02T21:24:00.000Z	sacarlson	Petskull	oh I thought you want the older version installed not the new one,  you want both?
2012-03-02T21:24:00.000Z	Petskull		yes
2012-03-02T21:24:00.000Z	Petskull		both
2012-03-02T21:25:00.000Z	sacarlson	Petskull	then I'm not sure about that,  I guess I would compile the later one into local/bin and the older from the repository
2012-03-02T21:26:00.000Z	Petskull	sacarlson	just download the tarball and install it?
2012-03-02T21:26:00.000Z	sacarlson	Petskull	then you put the full path to the one you want at the time
2012-03-02T21:26:00.000Z	sacarlson	Petskull	it depends on the software if it requires compile and what dependencies but there might be other ways
2012-03-02T21:27:00.000Z	Petskull	sacarlson	yeah, I actually thought about that, but I was looking for a better way
2012-03-02T21:27:00.000Z	Petskull		'cause installing from tarballs is always a mess
2012-03-02T21:27:00.000Z	Petskull		dependency hell, etc
2012-03-02T21:28:00.000Z	sacarlson	Petskull	I have about 3 different firefox installed with that method but not recomended for all users.  but for real bleading you normaly need to compile anyway
2012-03-02T21:29:00.000Z	sacarlson	Petskull	normaly bleading edge stuf is not tarballs anymore we get them from github or svn
2012-03-02T21:30:00.000Z	Petskull	sacarlson	yeah, I don't need anything like that
2012-03-02T21:34:00.000Z	sacarlson	Petskull	remind you with git you have full control over every possible version and branch in bettween every release forward and backward
2012-03-02T21:37:00.000Z	Petskull	sacarlson	holy fucking awesome- no compile required
2012-03-02T21:37:00.000Z	Petskull		it's got an executable binary
2012-03-02T21:38:00.000Z	sacarlson	Petskull	what that a question or an observation?  if it's ruby or java , perl, python ... then no it wouldn't  require any compile but normaly still have dependancies
2012-03-02T21:39:00.000Z	Petskull	sacarlson	observation
