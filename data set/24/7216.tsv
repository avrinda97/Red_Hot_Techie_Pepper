2005-04-14T09:37:00.000Z	mark_		Can I ask a fairly long question here?
2005-04-14T09:37:00.000Z	SuperQ	mark_	sure
2005-04-14T09:41:00.000Z	SuperQ	mark_	yea.. samba will work just fine
2005-04-14T09:41:00.000Z	SuperQ	mark_	if you want to simplify things
2005-04-14T09:43:00.000Z	SuperQ	mark_	mark_ http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/SettingUpSamba
2005-04-14T09:50:00.000Z	SuperQ	mark_	there isn't much to it
2005-04-14T09:50:00.000Z	SuperQ	mark_	if you want windows compatability, I suggest you just stick to samba
2005-04-14T09:53:00.000Z	SuperQ	mark_	how much file transfering are we talking about?
2005-04-14T09:53:00.000Z	SuperQ	mark_	do you need filesystem access, or is just one-or-two file copies what you need?
2005-04-14T09:54:00.000Z	mark_	SuperQ	 Just about anything - from docs to executables...
2005-04-14T09:54:00.000Z	SuperQ	mark_	you could just install openssh-server on the ubuntu machine, and use winscp on windows to grab files
2005-04-14T09:54:00.000Z	SuperQ	mark_	I'm talking more about quantity, than type of files
2005-04-14T09:56:00.000Z	mark_	SuperQ	 I think I'm thinking of the MS world with "pcAnywhere" - how about transfer and "take-over" capability?
2005-04-14T09:56:00.000Z	SuperQ	mark_	ubuntu uses VNC for remote desktop control
2005-04-14T09:57:00.000Z	SuperQ	mark_	System::Preferances::Remote Desktop
2005-04-14T09:57:00.000Z	SuperQ	mark_	then goto realvnc.com and download the client
2005-04-14T09:58:00.000Z	SuperQ	mark_	for windows
2005-04-14T09:58:00.000Z	mark_	SuperQ	 So, that's it.. thanks!
2005-04-14T09:58:00.000Z	SuperQ	mark_	you can also use VNC server for windows
2005-04-14T09:59:00.000Z	SuperQ	mark_	VNC is GUI stuff only, no file transfers
2005-04-14T10:00:00.000Z	mark_	SuperQ	 That's allright, I sometimes just want to get at my data files from work that are at home.  Thanks!
2005-04-14T10:01:00.000Z	SuperQ	mark_	yea.. http://winscp.sf.net/
2005-04-14T10:01:00.000Z	SuperQ	mark_	best windows utilitiy for doing linux file transfers
