2008-01-18T14:33:00.000Z	BoltClock		hate to repeat it but... ><
2008-01-18T14:34:00.000Z	gaurish	BoltClock	what amount of RAM you have?
2008-01-18T14:35:00.000Z	gaurish	BoltClock	and whats display card?
2008-01-18T14:35:00.000Z	BoltClock	gaurish	its an onboard NVIDIA GeForce7100
2008-01-18T14:36:00.000Z	gaurish	BoltClock	then use safe gfx mode & install :)
2008-01-18T14:38:00.000Z	gaurish	BoltClock	just install ubuntu & then solve your gfx problems
2008-01-18T14:40:00.000Z	BoltClock	gaurish	ok. i have two disks: a 250 gb where windows is installed and an unused 320 gb that i cant get ubuntu or windows to see, only my bios detects it fine. how do you recommend i install?
2008-01-18T14:41:00.000Z	gaurish	BoltClock	how do you know that your 320gb hdd is not detected by ubuntu?
2008-01-18T14:42:00.000Z	BoltClock	gaurish	wait, i might have seen it wrongly, ill connect to this channel again once i start ubuntu via live cd, brb
2008-01-18T14:51:00.000Z	BoltClock	gaurish	im on gutsy right now
2008-01-18T14:53:00.000Z	gaurish	BoltClock	ok go on install it, the known problem during install are: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CommonProblemsInstall
2008-01-18T14:56:00.000Z	gaurish	BoltClock	is there any data in that disk?
2008-01-18T14:57:00.000Z	gaurish	BoltClock	then go ahead , as this option erases all data on disk :)
2008-01-18T14:59:00.000Z	gaurish	BoltClock	not necessary , all most all drivers are installed by default, a few are they which are not open source so they are not installed by default
2008-01-18T15:00:00.000Z	gaurish	BoltClock	The boot loader would then read the operating system in from an outside storage
2008-01-18T15:00:00.000Z	BoltClock	gaurish	do i need it?
2008-01-18T15:01:00.000Z	gaurish	BoltClock	yes off course unless you don't plan to use your OS :p
2008-01-18T15:05:00.000Z	gaurish	BoltClock	lol, it depends how to setup the installer, now don't stop it, else surely you will lose data
2008-01-18T15:16:00.000Z	gaurish	BoltClock	yes
2008-01-18T15:16:00.000Z	gaurish	BoltClock	also there are many other ways to get help
2008-01-18T15:16:00.000Z	BoltClock	gaurish	i understand :)
2008-01-18T15:22:00.000Z	gaurish	BoltClock	depends upon hardware
2008-01-18T15:22:00.000Z	BoltClock	gaurish	ok
