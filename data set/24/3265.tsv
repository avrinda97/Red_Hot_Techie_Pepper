2008-03-19T06:36:00.000Z	stevendemorez		i dig synaptic only cause it's got a gui (I know I'm lame) make sure to have the gstreamer plugins installed
2008-03-19T06:37:00.000Z	stevendemorez	jayne	 and the w32 codecs
2008-03-19T06:37:00.000Z	jayne	stevendemorez	there are so many gstreamer plugins
2008-03-19T06:37:00.000Z	stevendemorez	jayne	 is what I've used to watch the few vcds I had
2008-03-19T06:38:00.000Z	jayne	stevendemorez	I cannot find w32 codecs in Synaptic
2008-03-19T06:38:00.000Z	stevendemorez	jayne	for the gstreamer plugins bad and ugly multiverse
2008-03-19T06:41:00.000Z	stevendemorez	jayne	for the w32 codecs check out medibuntu.org

2008-03-19T06:43:00.000Z	jayne	stevendemorez	its just in the list when searching for gstreamer
2008-03-19T06:43:00.000Z	stevendemorez	jayne	 it has some really useful stuff in there I have it installed but i don't think it's the vcd support
