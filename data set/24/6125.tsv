2006-04-25T14:06:00.000Z	marcin`		hi guys I need really fast help
2006-04-25T14:07:00.000Z	marcin`		I installed dapper beta on some laptop (noname crap)
2006-04-25T14:07:00.000Z	carthik	marcin`	you can speed up the rate by actually asking the wuestion faster...
2006-04-25T14:09:00.000Z	carthik	marcin`	please type your question on one line. Everyone has trouble following your problem. Make it short, sweet and precise
2006-04-25T14:09:00.000Z	marcin`	carthik	well it's hard to write this in one line
2006-04-25T14:11:00.000Z	carthik	marcin`	well, it's really not, if you think a little before you type. "marcin`'s keyboard's function key seems to be stuck, so that his keyboard behaves strangely. How can he fix this?"
2006-04-25T14:11:00.000Z	carthik	marcin`	well, is the fn key really stuck?
2006-04-25T14:11:00.000Z	marcin`	carthik	anyway - I got keyboard that has FN key and some special keys that should be accessible when FN key is down (numerical keyboard, brightness/contrast etc.) unfortunately this keyboard works like this FN is always down - and I have to press FN to write letters
2006-04-25T14:12:00.000Z	carthik	marcin`	find the keycode to that FN key, and disable it, perhaps?
2006-04-25T14:12:00.000Z	marcin`	carthik	fast question - how?
2006-04-25T14:13:00.000Z	carthik	marcin`	i suspect you'll find an answer here, I see quite a few: http://www.google.com/search?q=ubuntu+Fn+key+stuck
2006-04-25T14:15:00.000Z	marcin`	carthik	well no fast answer there and in fact there are patches required when FN doesn't work at all
2006-04-25T14:16:00.000Z	marcin`	carthik	could you tell how to disable this key?
2006-04-25T14:16:00.000Z	marcin`	carthik	I need really fast solution I have to give back this laptop in 15 minutes :(
2006-04-25T14:16:00.000Z	carthik	marcin`	alright what laptop is this?
2006-04-25T14:17:00.000Z	marcin`	carthik	some chinese crap
2006-04-25T14:17:00.000Z	carthik	marcin`	are you sure it's not a hardware problem?
2006-04-25T14:17:00.000Z	marcin`	carthik	no name - celeron 2.4/512 MB
2006-04-25T14:17:00.000Z	marcin`	carthik	it is ok on windows
2006-04-25T14:18:00.000Z	marcin`	carthik	and this keyboard works good on login
2006-04-25T14:19:00.000Z	carthik	marcin`	quick fix?? well, try using xev to find out the keycode. then blacklist that key maybe ? blacklisting works like http://ubuntu.wordpress.com/2006/02/10/unknown-key-pressed-error/
2006-04-25T14:31:00.000Z	marcin`	carthik	well I just had to give back this laptop to customer :(
2006-04-25T14:32:00.000Z	marcin`	carthik	and about xev this was first thing I did
2006-04-25T14:32:00.000Z	marcin`	carthik	and problem was that there was no reaction in xev when I pressed this FN button :(
