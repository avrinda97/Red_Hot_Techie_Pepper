2009-12-18T18:45:00.000Z	SAtjol		I have installed XChat.. When I connect..it just says : looking up server...connecting to chat....and hangs there - Nothing happens
2009-12-18T18:45:00.000Z	SAtjol		for that matter - the two other IRC apps I installed does the same
2009-12-18T18:46:00.000Z	scunizi	SAtjol	but your normal internet connect is good? as in Firefox?
2009-12-18T18:46:00.000Z	SAtjol		100%
2009-12-18T18:48:00.000Z	scunizi	SAtjol	how are you connecting with xchat? are you typing the command the commands or using the menu's?
2009-12-18T18:50:00.000Z	SAtjol	scunizi	- I run 9.10. Installed xchat via the Ubuntu Software centre - when I run it, I go to Applications..internet..Xchat
2009-12-18T18:50:00.000Z	scunizi	SAtjol	and xchat opens.. then what? how do you try to connect?
2009-12-18T18:51:00.000Z	SAtjol		it opens..then a box comes up with my name and nicks etc and on that there is a connect button. i then connects...and then it just hanggs
2009-12-18T18:53:00.000Z	scunizi	SAtjol	when you hit the connect button what does it connect to? just the irc server? or nothing?
2009-12-18T18:54:00.000Z	SAtjol	scunizi	It tries to connect to the irc server - in this case freenode - but the same applies if I want to connect to any other server
2009-12-18T18:55:00.000Z	scunizi	SAtjol	I've no idea what's going on.. have you tried irssi?
2009-12-18T18:56:00.000Z	SAtjol	scunizi	- nope - will download it and give a try
2009-12-18T18:56:00.000Z	scunizi	SAtjol	it's a cli client .. once loaded connect with /connect irc.freenode.net .. then .. /j #ubuntu
2009-12-18T18:57:00.000Z	SAtjol		I have tried smuxi and xchat gnome
2009-12-18T18:58:00.000Z	scunizi	SAtjol	don't know anything about smuxi but xchat is preferred over xchat gnome
2009-12-18T18:59:00.000Z	SAtjol	scunizi	- thanks for the help - I will try -
2009-12-18T18:59:00.000Z	SAtjol	scunizi	- I do not understand this - as everybody rates xchat - but i do beleive it is something else - not the client
2009-12-18T19:00:00.000Z	SAtjol	scunizi	- Anyway - will try - will win it somehow :)
