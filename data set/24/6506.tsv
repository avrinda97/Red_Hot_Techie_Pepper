2007-12-09T02:09:00.000Z	edfitz		E: dpkg was interrupted, you must manually run 'dpkg --configure -a' to correct the problem.
2007-12-09T02:09:00.000Z	edfitz		E: _cache->open() failed, please report.
2007-12-09T02:09:00.000Z	soundray	edfitz	have you tried running 'sudo dpkg --configure -a' as it suggests?
2007-12-09T02:10:00.000Z	soundray	edfitz	enter everything between the quote marks on a command line

2007-12-09T02:15:00.000Z	soundray	edfitz	enter 'sudo dpkg --configure -a' and type your user password when asked
2007-12-09T02:18:00.000Z	soundray	edfitz	how did you enter superuser mode?
2007-12-09T02:19:00.000Z	soundray	edfitz	are you on ubuntu?
2007-12-09T02:19:00.000Z	soundray	edfitz	you shouldn't use su at all on ubuntu. Type exit
2007-12-09T02:20:00.000Z	soundray	edfitz	have you got a $ prompt now?
2007-12-09T02:20:00.000Z	soundray	edfitz	enter 'sudo dpkg --configure -a'
2007-12-09T02:20:00.000Z	soundray	edfitz	no need to paste any output]
2007-12-09T02:22:00.000Z	soundray	edfitz	when it's done, do a 'sudo apt-get -f install' and repeat until the output doesn't change any more
2007-12-09T02:26:00.000Z	soundray	edfitz	yes
2007-12-09T02:26:00.000Z	soundray	edfitz	to save typing, get the previous command back with the arrow up key
2007-12-09T02:27:00.000Z	soundray	edfitz	not more than three times, hopefully
2007-12-09T02:29:00.000Z	soundray	edfitz	repeating the command gives you the same output as the previous time
2007-12-09T02:31:00.000Z	soundray	edfitz	you can, and it makes for a cleaner system, but it's not strictly necessary.
2007-12-09T02:32:00.000Z	soundray	edfitz	yes
2007-12-09T02:33:00.000Z	soundray	edfitz	this should complete  the upgrade.
2007-12-09T02:34:00.000Z	soundray	edfitz	I don't know, but it can't hurt
2007-12-09T02:35:00.000Z	soundray	edfitz	come back and ask whenever you have to. Sometimes you have to repeat your question to get an answer. Leave 10 minutes between repetitions.
