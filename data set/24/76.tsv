2012-08-17T05:51:00.000Z	zykotick9	Erin	FYI you usinally want to check for an EE (error) in xorg.X.log - you don't have any :|
2012-08-17T05:53:00.000Z	zykotick9	Erin	these sort of issues (breaking from updates) is not uncommon with ubuntu.  with other distros it's unheard of...
2012-08-17T05:56:00.000Z	zykotick9	Erin	are you logged in as root, or using sudo?
2012-08-18T03:33:00.000Z	zykotick9	Erin	you need to use "sudo apt-get dist-upgrade" to do the same thing as the GUI update manager (it updates everything)
2012-08-18T03:34:00.000Z	Erin	zykotick9	yea someone told me that in Pm and it worked.
2012-08-18T03:34:00.000Z	Erin	zykotick9	remember me lol from earlier with the stupid nvidia/vga problem it was all solved by a reinstall :-P
2012-08-18T03:35:00.000Z	zykotick9	Erin	"solved by a reinstall" funny, i wouldn't consider that a solution ;)  glad it's working for ya!
2012-08-18T03:35:00.000Z	zykotick9	Erin	kernels almost always require dist-upgrade FYI
2012-08-18T03:36:00.000Z	Erin	zykotick9	well it was the only way to get it fixed I figured, I tried alot of stuff nothing was working some kind of "ghost" was in the machine. Install was very quick and getting stuff re-setup was actually easy since I just saved all my config files like sshd_config and smb.conf etc
2012-08-18T03:37:00.000Z	zykotick9	Erin	backing up config files is smart!  so is reinstall - if you have no other option
2012-08-18T03:37:00.000Z	Erin	zykotick9	later today i'll make a full hd image with DD incase anything gets jacked up.
2012-08-18T03:37:00.000Z	Erin	zykotick9	yea I tried to fix it for probably 8-10 hours over two days and reinstalled it worked out of the box :-)
2012-08-18T03:37:00.000Z	zykotick9	Erin	waste of space to do drive imaging (that's a windows thing).  but do whatever you think best.
2012-08-18T03:38:00.000Z	Erin	zykotick9	why is it a waste of space? one command I have a 100% backup and I can re-install the backup with one command as well.
2012-08-18T03:38:00.000Z	zykotick9	Erin	you just proved how fast reinstall is ;)
2012-08-18T03:38:00.000Z	Erin	zykotick9	why is it a waste of space? one command I have a 100% backup and I can re-install the backup with one command as well.
2012-08-18T03:39:00.000Z	zykotick9	Erin	do what YOU want.  we can hold different opinions and both be right ;)
2012-08-18T03:39:00.000Z	Erin	zykotick9	thats what big hard drives are for ;-P
2012-08-18T03:40:00.000Z	Erin	zykotick9	my / on this machine is only 40gb its an ssd and then I got a 1TB drive for storage. this is my music/home server machine. ;-)
2012-08-18T03:41:00.000Z	zykotick9	Erin	i run 60GB SSD (58% full), 1TB (52% full), 1TB (67% full) and 500GB (46% full).  i can fill my drives with better stuff ;)  config files take so little to backup.
2012-08-18T03:42:00.000Z	Erin	zykotick9	yea they do and linux is awesome cause most things are controlled by one text file lol
2012-08-18T03:43:00.000Z	zykotick9	Erin	oh how i love "config files" ;)
2012-08-18T03:43:00.000Z	zykotick9	Erin	and the whole home directory with hidden for settings - brilliant
2012-08-18T03:45:00.000Z	zykotick9	Erin	i have NOTHING against backups!  it's just i think drive imaging is a "waste of space"...
