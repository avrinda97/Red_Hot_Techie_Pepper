2008-03-12T08:58:00.000Z	zero88	Newbuntu2	got to System > Administration > Network
2008-03-12T08:59:00.000Z	zero88	Newbuntu2	Do you see a wireless Connection there?
2008-03-12T08:59:00.000Z	Newbuntu2	zero88	yes, roaming
2008-03-12T08:59:00.000Z	zero88	Newbuntu2	click on it and edit it
2008-03-12T09:00:00.000Z	Newbuntu2	zero88	I can disable roaming, but there is nothing on the essid pulldown list
2008-03-12T09:00:00.000Z	zero88	Newbuntu2	highlight the wireless connection, and click on Properties. check the box Enable this connection. and fill out the info for the wireless ESSID and Key
2008-03-12T09:01:00.000Z	zero88	Newbuntu2	ok. Open a terminal and type     iwconfig  and post it here.   !pastebin

2008-03-12T09:02:00.000Z	zero88	Newbuntu2	hm, let me think about this. You have a wireless option becuase your system sees your wireless card, but you cant see any wireless networks..
2008-03-12T09:03:00.000Z	zero88	Newbuntu2	do you know what kind of card you have?
2008-03-12T09:04:00.000Z	Newbuntu2	zero88	its an EUB362. I'm using ndiswrapper
2008-03-12T09:04:00.000Z	zero88	Newbuntu2	oh ok. So have you gotten it to work at all yet?
2008-03-12T09:04:00.000Z	Newbuntu2	zero88	just installed it
2008-03-12T09:05:00.000Z	zero88	Newbuntu2	Have you rebooted the system yet. better yet what does this command say.    Ndiswrapper -l

2008-03-12T09:09:00.000Z	zero88	Newbuntu2	well to tell you the truth I dont think i could help you any more. Im stuck pretty much at the same location as you. Ndiswrapper says the same thing for me, but i could never connect. Myc ard lets me see wireless networks but cant connect. My advice for you is to go to Ndiswrapper website. and somewhere i think in the Q/A's or somewhere, it will tell you specifics for your card. For my card it told me i can only see net
2008-03-12T09:09:00.000Z	zero88		works, but canot connect
2008-03-12T09:15:00.000Z	Newbuntu2	zero88	what is the bootloader part in http://www.keenansystems.com/nub362_eub362_linux_ndiswrapper_driver_howto.htm
2008-03-12T09:17:00.000Z	zero88	Newbuntu2	 let me see
2008-03-12T09:18:00.000Z	zero88	Newbuntu2	 not sure, did you not do that part?
2008-03-12T09:19:00.000Z	Newbuntu2	zero88	no, I'm not sure what it means/what I'm supposed to type. I don't have a command called load_fw_ar5523
2008-03-12T09:20:00.000Z	zero88	Newbuntu2	 im not sure. not sure what a bootloader is
