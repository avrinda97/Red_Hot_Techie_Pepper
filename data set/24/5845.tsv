2006-04-22T06:53:00.000Z	_jason	acid-trip	php4 is in universe, php5 is in breezy main
2006-04-22T06:57:00.000Z	_jason	acid-trip	are you using hoary?
2006-04-22T06:58:00.000Z	_jason	acid-trip	warty then?
2006-04-22T06:58:00.000Z	_jason	acid-trip	you seem to have warty and hoary repos
2006-04-22T07:01:00.000Z	_jason	acid-trip	you don't need to just uncomment.  You need to delete what you have and replace them with the proper ones for breezy
2006-04-22T07:02:00.000Z	_jason	acid-trip	you should still fix your sources :)
2006-04-22T07:17:00.000Z	acid-trip	_jason	you know anything about the php4 and apache for ubuntu?
