2005-07-23T12:10:00.000Z	jasoncohen	robotgeek	talking to yourself now?
2005-07-23T12:10:00.000Z	robotgeek	jasoncohen	i am not real, am i?
2005-07-23T12:15:00.000Z	jasoncohen	robotgeek	it seems to take a while- took over 2 weeks last time. i just installed the official mozilla build
2005-07-23T12:17:00.000Z	robotgeek	jasoncohen	i am on ppc, so mozilla build doesn't work
2005-07-23T12:17:00.000Z	robotgeek	jasoncohen	i dunno if they have a ppc veersion
2005-07-23T12:24:00.000Z	jasoncohen	robotgeek	no one purchased a PC with windows on it?
2005-07-23T12:25:00.000Z	robotgeek	jasoncohen	well, ther's a difference in the way it works
2005-07-23T12:27:00.000Z	robotgeek	jasoncohen	the big guns like HP/Compaq come with legal version. but the build ur own is much cheaper
2005-07-23T12:27:00.000Z	robotgeek	jasoncohen	and those people generally prefer not to buy their windows copies
2005-07-23T12:27:00.000Z	jasoncohen	robotgeek	but comparitively few people build their own computers or buy bare PCs
2005-07-23T12:28:00.000Z	robotgeek	jasoncohen	nah...there are guys who build it for you, say ur local geek
2005-07-23T12:28:00.000Z	jasoncohen	robotgeek	and how many people do you think do that?
2005-07-23T12:29:00.000Z	robotgeek	jasoncohen	local geeks have stores, and they have friends
2005-07-25T08:56:00.000Z	jasoncohen	robotgeek	lol - i'm running 1.0.6!!
2005-08-31T12:07:00.000Z	robotgeek	jasoncohen	LCD monitors have a refresh rate?
2005-08-31T12:08:00.000Z	robotgeek	jasoncohen	okay, if you say so :)
2005-08-31T12:08:00.000Z	jasoncohen	robotgeek	they don't?
