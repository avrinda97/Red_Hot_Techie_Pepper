2008-09-18T23:12:00.000Z	chadeldridge		So exactly how dangerous would it be to go to 2.6.24-21 in 8.04 ... or for that matter enable the "proposed" updates to run ?
2008-09-18T23:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chadeldridge	is your current kernel ok?
2008-09-19T19:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chadeldridge	did you update /etc/hostname and  /etc/hosts
2008-12-18T05:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chadeldridge	what does ifconfig say its running at?
2008-12-18T05:51:00.000Z	chadeldridge	ActionParsnip	 the tx line says 1000 but the speed is only 100 also network-manager says 100.  If i reboot and send the same set of files its massively faster
2008-12-18T05:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chadeldridge	sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart
2008-12-18T05:53:00.000Z	chadeldridge	ActionParsnip	still says 100 in network-manager, 1000 in ifconfig and speed is still slow (80mb ish)
2008-12-18T05:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chadeldridge	you could try specifying speed in /etc/network/interfaces file and set it up there
2008-12-18T05:54:00.000Z	chadeldridge	ActionParsnip	yeah let me just not use network-manager for the eth0 and see if that works, i had an issue with not getting gateway before
2008-12-18T05:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chadeldridge	i dont use it. i think its worthless
2008-12-18T06:02:00.000Z	chadeldridge	ActionParsnip	let me make sure i am right here .. i need to edit interfaces only or interfaces and resolv.conf
2008-12-18T06:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chadeldridge	interfaces should be ok, i would edit resolv.conf to add dns servers
2008-12-18T06:03:00.000Z	chadeldridge	ActionParsnip	they change all day though .. i plug in about 10 places
2008-12-18T06:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chadeldridge	ah
2008-12-18T06:03:00.000Z	chadeldridge	ActionParsnip	will it dhcp them ?
2008-12-18T06:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chadeldridge	well try it, just to test
2008-12-18T06:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chadeldridge	yes, you will get dhcp (i believe) but the settings will override
2008-12-18T06:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chadeldridge	once you have tested, if you remove that file and reboot you will get a fresh blank config
2008-12-18T06:08:00.000Z	chadeldridge	ActionParsnip	ok .. well i edited the interface file and now i am getting it scrolling to get dhcp for eth0 which is currently not pluged in
2008-12-18T06:08:00.000Z	chadeldridge	ActionParsnip	does it give up after a while of keep trying ?
2008-12-18T06:08:00.000Z	chadeldridge	ActionParsnip	ahh nm .. it gave up
2008-12-18T06:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chadeldridge	then just comment out the config for eth0, or wait. it will time out
2008-12-18T06:17:00.000Z	chadeldridge	ActionParsnip	sorry to be a bother ... but unless i use network-manager i have no dns resolution.  the resolve.conf file is blank
2008-12-18T06:21:00.000Z	chadeldridge	ActionParsnip	should the resolv.conf file be blank.  shouldnt i be getting dns from dhcp like all the other clients on this network?
