2008-04-28T20:41:00.000Z	whiteeagle		ummmm, I did sudo apt-get update then sudo apt-get upgrade and I have to get 1400 MBs of updates??
2008-04-28T20:41:00.000Z	whiteeagle		gutsy user
2008-04-28T20:41:00.000Z	whiteeagle		I think thats too weird
2008-04-28T20:42:00.000Z	whiteeagle		why 1400 MBs of updates
2008-04-28T20:42:00.000Z	noodlesgc	whiteeagle	whens the last time you upgraded?
2008-04-28T20:42:00.000Z	whiteeagle	noodlesgc	a week ago
2008-04-28T20:42:00.000Z	noodlesgc	whiteeagle	and how many packages do you have installed?
2008-04-28T20:42:00.000Z	whiteeagle	noodlesgc	how to see that
2008-04-28T20:42:00.000Z	whiteeagle	noodlesgc	exactly
2008-04-28T20:42:00.000Z	noodlesgc	whiteeagle	open synaptic and look at the status bar
2008-04-28T20:43:00.000Z	noodlesgc	whiteeagle	i think that you'll be fine, though you can look at changelogs with the update-manager
2008-04-28T20:44:00.000Z	whiteeagle	noodlesgc	and there are 913 updates available
2008-04-28T20:45:00.000Z	whiteeagle	noodlesgc	and one more question, I want to upgrade to hardy, and doing sudo do-release-upgrade in terminal tells me I need to dl around 2200 MBs of updates, so are those ~1400 MB updates included in those???
2008-04-28T20:46:00.000Z	noodlesgc	whiteeagle	i think so. be sure to use the -m desktop switch though
2008-04-28T20:46:00.000Z	whiteeagle	noodlesgc	oh, thanks I haven't included that
2008-04-28T20:47:00.000Z	whiteeagle	noodlesgc	sorry, but when I do sudo do-release-upgrade -m i get: "do-release-upgrade: error: -m option requires an argument
2008-04-28T20:48:00.000Z	noodlesgc	whiteeagle	-m desktop
2008-04-28T20:55:00.000Z	noodlesgc	whiteeagle	the upgrade didn't work?
2008-04-28T20:55:00.000Z	whiteeagle	noodlesgc	just see the pastebin http://rafb.net/p/GbfuE546.txt
2008-04-28T20:56:00.000Z	noodlesgc	whiteeagle	try sudo dpkg-reconfigure update-manager
2008-04-28T20:58:00.000Z	noodlesgc	whiteeagle	did you sudo dpkg-reconfigure update-manager ?
2008-04-28T20:58:00.000Z	whiteeagle	noodlesgc	yes
2008-04-28T20:59:00.000Z	noodlesgc	whiteeagle	still does not work?
2008-04-28T20:59:00.000Z	whiteeagle	noodlesgc	I get: The generated cache was invalid.
