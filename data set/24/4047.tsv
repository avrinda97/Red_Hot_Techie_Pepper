2008-07-10T17:03:00.000Z	IdleOne	kinglet	why not use the pidgin in the repos?
2008-07-10T17:04:00.000Z	kinglet	IdleOne	repos? what is repos? :D
2008-07-10T17:05:00.000Z	IdleOne	kinglet	why not use the pidgin that is installed by ubuntu?
2008-07-10T17:05:00.000Z	kinglet	IdleOne	cuz it is not the latest version!
2008-07-10T17:05:00.000Z	kinglet	IdleOne	I am installing the new version 2.4.3
2008-07-10T17:06:00.000Z	kinglet	IdleOne	sorry disconnected! can u help me more?
2008-07-10T17:07:00.000Z	IdleOne	kinglet	the newest version is not always the best version. if you want to you can look at the depends that are required and compile them all yourself but that is probably not the best idea
2008-07-10T17:08:00.000Z	kinglet	IdleOne	I know! but I want to use it ...
2008-07-10T17:16:00.000Z	IdleOne	kinglet	I already told you what to do. you need to upgrade perl libcairo2 libglib2.0-0 libpango1.0-0 libpurple0. which probably have a bunch of they're own depends and if you think all that hassle is worth it then go ahead. personally I would just upgrade the OS and get the latest version Ubuntu offers
2008-07-10T17:17:00.000Z	kinglet	IdleOne	Ok I will try it
2008-07-10T17:17:00.000Z	kinglet	IdleOne	gordonjcp der|kunstler tnx guys I will try it
2008-07-10T17:17:00.000Z	IdleOne	kinglet	you will try compiling all that yourself?
2008-07-10T17:18:00.000Z	IdleOne	kinglet	good luck with that :)
2008-07-10T17:19:00.000Z	IdleOne	kinglet	yes do a backup first please
2008-07-10T20:04:00.000Z	IdleOne	kinglet	 you will need to download and compile all the depends for pidgin. you are better off upgrading the OS.
2008-07-10T20:05:00.000Z	IdleOne	kinglet	what you are trying to do would be difficult for someone who has many years of linux experience. just upgrade to 8.04
2008-07-10T20:07:00.000Z	kinglet	IdleOne	My problem is: I dont know what is the packages I need to install!
2008-07-10T20:07:00.000Z	kinglet	IdleOne	can u help me?
2008-07-10T20:08:00.000Z	IdleOne	kinglet	package for what?
2008-07-10T20:09:00.000Z	kinglet	IdleOne	the problem for install pidgin is perl version, and I want to upgrade my perl! and I don know how
2008-07-10T20:12:00.000Z	IdleOne	kinglet	ok let me explain it to you so you understand. please keep in mind that I am not trying to insult you. right now you are not ready or capable of doing such an upgrade of perl. you don't have enough knoledge not to mention that updating perl will probably cause other issues. besides the fact that from your pastebin earlier today you have 6 other depends you need to upgrade that are not yet available in ubuntu. solution do a dist-upgrade to
2008-07-10T20:14:00.000Z	IdleOne	kinglet	just because pidgin has released a new version does not mean that it is better then the one provided with Ubuntu 8.04. I really think you need to do an upgrade of Ubuntu and not of pidgin
