2011-11-04T00:37:00.000Z	mrdeb		i mean umount --mount /dev/sdb1
2011-11-04T00:37:00.000Z	mrdeb		no udisks, sorry
2011-11-04T00:39:00.000Z	mrdeb		ok
2011-11-04T00:41:00.000Z	mrdeb		from terminal
2011-11-04T00:41:00.000Z	mrdeb		sorry it is udisks --mount
2011-11-04T00:42:00.000Z	mrdeb		yes so you can go apt-get install udisks
2011-11-04T00:42:00.000Z	kyan	mrdeb	the purpose of the flash drive was to install some partition management software (the machine isn't online).
2011-11-04T00:36:00.000Z	mrdeb	kyan	u can do umount /dev/sdb1 or c depends
2011-11-04T00:36:00.000Z	kyan	mrdeb	thanks!
2011-11-04T00:39:00.000Z	kyan	mrdeb	Ah, thanks.
2011-11-04T00:39:00.000Z	kyan	mrdeb	I was getting an invalid argument error (I used fdisk to check the dev file)
2011-11-04T00:40:00.000Z	mrdeb	kyan	what do you mean. you have to install udisks and then go 'udisks --mount /dev/sdb1 if b is the usb drive
2011-11-04T00:41:00.000Z	kyan	mrdeb	Ohhh. Ok.
2011-11-04T00:41:00.000Z	kyan	mrdeb	I thought I could type umount --mount /dev/sdb1 like in the example.
2011-11-04T00:41:00.000Z	kyan	mrdeb	Ok I'll try udisks.
2011-11-04T00:42:00.000Z	kyan	mrdeb	udisk isn't installed.
2011-11-04T00:43:00.000Z	kyan	mrdeb	so I can't install anything without the flash drive, and I can't use the flash drive without installing something.
2011-11-04T00:43:00.000Z	kyan	mrdeb	:-P
2011-11-04T00:44:00.000Z	kyan	mrdeb	what should I do about that?
2011-11-04T00:45:00.000Z	kyan	mrdeb	well I couldn't get the deb file without using the flash drive.
2011-11-04T00:46:00.000Z	kyan	mrdeb	I could burn a cd with the software on it, but the system is running from a cd.
2011-11-04T00:49:00.000Z	kyan	mrdeb	should I try burning a cd (can you say overkill for burning an 81k executable to a cd) and using that anyway?
2011-11-04T00:50:00.000Z	mrdeb	kyan	ok you can try
2011-11-04T00:50:00.000Z	kyan	mrdeb	ok thanksâ€¦ :-P
