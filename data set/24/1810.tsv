2009-08-12T13:14:00.000Z	Guest27542		trijntje: (still not getting help in ubuntu-bugs otherwise i wouldnt be bothering you still). i started with >crash.txt and firefox crashed. i rebooted and all i see is an empty crash.txt file in my home dir
2009-08-12T13:15:00.000Z	pkkm	Guest27542	Did you try redirecting error log like '$ app 2>&1 > file' ?
2009-08-12T13:16:00.000Z	Guest27542		trijntje: while frozen?
2009-08-12T13:17:00.000Z	Guest27542	pkkm	not entirely sure what that means/entails doing, so no. Is there something I should do in the terminal next time I run firefox?
2009-08-12T13:20:00.000Z	Guest27542		trijntje: alt+sysrq+k worked as well. I guess the Alt+sysrq+___ are the only ones that work
2009-08-12T13:23:00.000Z	Guest27542		Thanks that makes it easier to recover from the crash/freeze. Still don't know what's causing it though.
2009-08-12T13:24:00.000Z	Guest27542		And I was told not to ask for that kind of help in ubuntu-bugs
2009-08-12T13:27:00.000Z	pkkm		!dontzap > pkkm
2009-08-12T13:27:00.000Z	Guest27542		trijntje: Ok I'll do that next. I'm pretty naive when it comes to these things, but wouldn't the fact that 'firefox >crash.txt' only created an empty crash.txt after it crashed mean that its a bug with Ubuntu. (Especially since it's not jst FF that freezes but everything)
2009-08-12T13:28:00.000Z	pkkm	Guest27542	Here you can read about redirections: http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Bash-Prog-Intro-HOWTO-3.html
2009-08-12T13:29:00.000Z	pkkm	Guest27542	stderr is error output
2009-08-12T13:32:00.000Z	Guest27542		trijntje: Ok, using a new profile the usual suspects aren't causing crashes it seems. So maybe it is a plugin. Sorry I should have looked into that and not just my add-ons. What should I do now though?
2009-08-12T13:36:00.000Z	Guest27542	pkkm	so I should start firefox in the terminal using 'firefox 2>&1 >crash.txt' or is that not correct?
2009-08-12T13:38:00.000Z	pkkm	Guest27542	I read about redirections again now and I would rather suggert starting it with 'firefox &>crash.txt', because thet redirects ALL outputs to file.
2009-08-12T13:38:00.000Z	pkkm		*suggest
2009-08-12T13:39:00.000Z	Guest27542	pkkm	ok doing that now. thanks
2009-08-12T13:39:00.000Z	pkkm	Guest27542	no problem
2009-08-12T13:40:00.000Z	Guest27542	pkkm	did that and ended up with an empty crash.txt file again
2009-08-12T13:41:00.000Z	pkkm	Guest27542	Then I think firefox just does not output anything to console.
2009-08-12T13:43:00.000Z	Guest27542		actionparsnip: how could I find that?
2009-08-12T13:43:00.000Z	pkkm	Guest27542	try asking on #firefox
2009-08-12T13:46:00.000Z	Guest27542		actionparsnip: I created a new profile, which I think is what you're getting at, and I haven't been able to get it crash with the new profile.
2009-08-12T13:47:00.000Z	Guest27542	pkkm	no response on #firefox but the ubuntu forum archives say something about 'firefox --debug' and 'firefox -g' should I try one of those and how could I get those to redirect their output?
2009-08-12T13:48:00.000Z	pkkm	Guest27542	'command &> file' works on all commands.
