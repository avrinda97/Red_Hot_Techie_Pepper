2008-01-30T10:55:00.000Z	spdf	laughzilla	You can use Rythmbox or gtkpod to add songs to the ipod. However, with new ipods, you need new versions of libgpod to get them to work
2008-01-30T10:56:00.000Z	spdf	laughzilla	The libgpod included with gutsy will corrupt the database on the newer ipods
2008-01-30T10:56:00.000Z	laughzilla	spdf	- i'm on ubuntu 7.10
2008-01-30T10:58:00.000Z	laughzilla	spdf	- i am using ubuntu 7.10 Gutsy Gibbon, in fact
2008-01-30T10:59:00.000Z	spdf	laughzilla	Yep, thats gutsy. I actually corrupted mine before I found the packages and instructions
2008-01-30T11:00:00.000Z	spdf	laughzilla	Yes, the newer version supports the newer classics and nanos
2008-01-30T11:01:00.000Z	spdf	laughzilla	I believe its in backports
2008-01-30T11:02:00.000Z	spdf	laughzilla	You'll want to get get 0.6.0 at least

2008-01-30T11:03:00.000Z	spdf	laughzilla	That's the site I got the packages from. He says to install them in that order, but you need to reverse them.
2008-01-30T11:04:00.000Z	spdf	laughzilla	Afterwards, it worked perfectly. Just follow the instructions
2008-01-30T11:04:00.000Z	laughzilla	spdf	- follow the instructions, in reverse order?
2008-01-30T11:05:00.000Z	spdf	laughzilla	No, just reverse the the order you install the packages
2008-01-30T11:05:00.000Z	spdf	laughzilla	libgpod2 before libgpod-dev
2008-01-30T11:09:00.000Z	spdf	laughzilla	You won't need to jump through hoops to get it working in hardy though, its all updated
2008-01-30T11:09:00.000Z	laughzilla	spdf	- good to know ...
2008-01-30T11:11:00.000Z	laughzilla	spdf	i should remove my libgpod2 via synaptic before i upgrade it with the files i download via the ftp from that url you showed me, right?
2008-01-30T11:13:00.000Z	spdf	laughzilla	No need, just install them
2008-01-30T11:39:00.000Z	laughzilla	spdf	- ok so i did the upgrade according to those instrux and ran rhythmbox again ... now how do i import my mp3 files to the ipod ?  i tried to do "import directory" but it did not add anything as far as i can see, to the rhytmbox list of audio files in the ipod.
2008-01-30T11:41:00.000Z	spdf	laughzilla	You can drag the directory into the rhythmbox window I believe, the add folder worked for me though
2008-01-30T11:48:00.000Z	laughzilla	spdf	 it does not work by dragging the dir to rhythmbox, however, it works by "dragging" the song files themselves from the .mp3 dir on my hdd to the songlist in rhythmbox  !!  and it works !! i'm listening now to one of the songs on the ipod (after having safely disconnected it)  :)  THANK YOU dudes!!!  i appreciate this very much, and i know my friend will be very glad!  :)
2008-01-30T11:49:00.000Z	spdf	laughzilla	There you go man, np
2008-01-30T11:49:00.000Z	spdf	laughzilla	Took me an afternoon tog et that far, glad I could get you up and running
