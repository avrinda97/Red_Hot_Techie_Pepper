2009-01-14T18:50:00.000Z	Favorit		hi there.
2009-01-14T18:50:00.000Z	Favorit		guys, anyone got nvidia gtx260 working with hw acceleration drivers in Xorg?
2009-01-14T18:50:00.000Z	Favorit		I have 2 of those in sli mode, every single driver that comes with the distro says it can't find any devices
2009-01-14T18:51:00.000Z	ikonia	Favorit	sli doesn't work properly
2009-01-14T18:51:00.000Z	Favorit	ikonia	well, screw sli :) it should recognize at least 1 video card, right?
2009-01-14T18:51:00.000Z	ikonia	Favorit	not in sli mode
2009-01-14T18:51:00.000Z	ikonia	Favorit	if the two cards are joined it won't see any
2009-01-14T18:51:00.000Z	Favorit	ikonia	so with the interconnect cables ... oh crap
2009-01-14T19:20:00.000Z	Favorit	ikonia	hmm, and native NVidia drivers, the ones that are to download from nvidia.com, do those see the videocards with those cables inbetween? I don't need SLi, i just need hardware acceleration of one card under linux without having to pull those SLi cables out :)
2009-01-14T19:22:00.000Z	ikonia	Favorit	I don't think any support SLI
2009-01-14T19:22:00.000Z	ikonia	Favorit	the irony is that earlier drivers did "support" sli - in that worked as you want, but sli technology was very early
2009-01-14T19:23:00.000Z	Favorit	ikonia	it's a bit weird, cuz 1.0-8174 had SLi support. and that was almost 4 years ago :)
2009-01-14T19:23:00.000Z	ikonia	Favorit	as I said, the old ones did
2009-01-14T19:23:00.000Z	Favorit	ikonia	ah, they ripped it out.. bastards.
2009-02-19T15:20:00.000Z	ikonia	Favorit	only editors can update the bot
2009-02-19T15:40:00.000Z	ikonia	Favorit	you've done !help about 5 times now
2009-02-19T15:41:00.000Z	Favorit	ikonia	twice in last 4 days, and that's not my fault that channel has so much traffic I can't scroll for the url
2009-02-19T15:41:00.000Z	ikonia	Favorit	you know you can use the bot in pm
2009-02-19T15:42:00.000Z	Favorit	ikonia	ah, i see, thanks. Didn't know it responds to pm'
2009-02-19T15:42:00.000Z	ikonia	Favorit	handy to know
2009-02-19T15:42:00.000Z	Favorit	ikonia	indeed :)
2009-02-19T15:45:00.000Z	ikonia	Favorit	sure, put that user in the admin group
2009-02-19T15:46:00.000Z	ikonia	Favorit	or create a new group that has sudo privilges for apt-get and add the user to that to be more specific
2009-02-19T15:46:00.000Z	ikonia	Favorit	sorry - not you
