2008-12-28T21:07:00.000Z	worldwidesuicide	onetinsoldier	could you help me set internet time on my system clock
2008-12-28T21:08:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	worldwidesuicide	i dunno, if i can?
2008-12-28T21:08:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	worldwidesuicide	what exactly do you mean by internet time?
2008-12-28T21:10:00.000Z	worldwidesuicide	onetinsoldier	right click clock and look under preferences > help
2008-12-28T21:10:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	worldwidesuicide	what exactly do you mean by internet time? are you talking about in the clock preferences?
2008-12-28T21:10:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	worldwidesuicide	ok, what do you need help with there?
2008-12-28T21:12:00.000Z	worldwidesuicide	onetinsoldier	when i click "set internet time" under "udjust date and time," nothing happens
2008-12-28T21:13:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	worldwidesuicide	i can click 'time settings', then i get another little window and i can click 'set system time' to which i had to enter my password, but that's about all i see here
2008-12-28T21:16:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	worldwidesuicide	you set the time up above those buttons, then when you click 'set system time' it set the time that you put above to the systems time... nothing supposed to happen. it just sets the system time to the value that you put in and when you click 'set system time', that what it does when it disappears
2008-12-28T21:17:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	worldwidesuicide	if you concerned about having internet time, install and run 'ntpdate' occasionally
2008-12-28T21:17:00.000Z	worldwidesuicide	onetinsoldier	there are supposed to be options to 'set internet time,' 'set unix time,' etc
2008-12-28T21:18:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	worldwidesuicide	there are? because i don't have thos options either
2008-12-28T21:18:00.000Z	worldwidesuicide	onetinsoldier	 right click clock, preferences, help.
2008-12-28T21:21:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	worldwidesuicide	roger. hang on
2008-12-28T21:23:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	worldwidesuicide	looks like a bug or something
2008-12-28T21:25:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	worldwidesuicide	if it's really suppose to have those options, then it's a bug. i don't have them either
2008-12-28T21:27:00.000Z	worldwidesuicide	onetinsoldier	is there a program to keep my clock coordinated with internet time?
2008-12-28T21:27:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	worldwidesuicide	yes, but i think maybe it needs some configuring or something. anyway, it's called 'ntpdate'
2008-12-28T21:38:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	worldwidesuicide	are you in the us?
2008-12-28T21:31:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	worldwidesuicide	ntpdate is used like so  -->  sudo  ntpdate ntp.ubuntu.com
2008-12-28T21:32:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	worldwidesuicide	28 Dec 09:31:07 ntpdate[6610]: step time server 91.189.94.4 offset 19.674957 sec
2008-12-28T21:32:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	worldwidesuicide	you(and i) should try and find an ntp server close to our location though if we can
2008-12-28T21:38:00.000Z	worldwidesuicide	onetinsoldier	how do i set my timezone to utc?
2008-12-28T21:40:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	worldwidesuicide	try the 'tzconfig' command. i've never really messed with it much
