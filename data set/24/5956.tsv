2006-03-22T10:23:00.000Z	silvaran		Yeah, I thought automatix was the electronic equivalent of the dipping bird...?
2006-03-22T10:24:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	silvaran	Exactly!
2006-03-22T10:26:00.000Z	silvaran	FunnyLookinHat	Only 5 responses out of 634 users :)
2006-03-22T10:26:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	silvaran	half of which are idle...  so that ain't bad
2006-03-22T10:29:00.000Z	silvaran	FunnyLookinHat	It's not as technical a question.
2006-03-22T10:42:00.000Z	silvaran	FunnyLookinHat	enlightenment ?
2006-03-22T10:42:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	silvaran	that's it!
2006-03-22T10:42:00.000Z	silvaran	FunnyLookinHat	Yeah, I can't wait for dr17... of course, the last major release was october 2000 or something like that, so I'm not holding my breath for rasterman...
2006-03-22T10:43:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	silvaran	hahaha.  I've decided that they should all just stick to either KDE or Gnome and stop making all these offshoots.  but that's a whole other debate
2006-03-22T10:43:00.000Z	silvaran	FunnyLookinHat	Well that's the thing... a lot of the stuff that he's advocating (and writing) will soon be in the core X (Xgl/Xegl/aiglx)... having trouble with aiglx in dapper myself, need to wait until a few more people get exposed to it.
2006-03-22T10:44:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	silvaran	you said "he"... who are you referring to?  Linus?  Mark Shuttleworth?
2006-03-22T10:44:00.000Z	silvaran	FunnyLookinHat	rasterman
2006-03-22T10:44:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	silvaran	ooho ok, i am reading it correctly now
2006-03-22T10:45:00.000Z	silvaran	FunnyLookinHat	As long as I'm writing it correctly ;)
2006-03-22T10:57:00.000Z	silvaran	FunnyLookinHat	or worst yet, vbscript
2006-03-22T11:37:00.000Z	silvaran	FunnyLookinHat	I thought only a few wireless cards work "out of the box" -- that you still need to do a win32 binary driver install a la ndiswrapper
2006-03-22T11:37:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	silvaran	I've had great luck with several different wireless cards, so maybe it's just me?
2006-03-22T11:38:00.000Z	silvaran	FunnyLookinHat	It might just be a coincidence... some ARE supported... I've yet to come across one personally that's supported, but I'm aware that they ARE out there and they're popular... I'm probably the isolated one :)
2006-03-22T11:39:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	silvaran	best luck happens with Intel based wireless chipsets
2006-03-22T11:39:00.000Z	silvaran	FunnyLookinHat	Strange you say that, I found the i810 (video) driver had good hardware support too, for an OSS card... must be Intel then.  I've got an nforce-based mobo on my laptop with a broadcom wireless chip...
2006-03-22T11:52:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	silvaran	I have two gigs of ram... does that mean I can remove swap  ;)
2006-03-22T11:53:00.000Z	silvaran	FunnyLookinHat	And same question to you :)
2006-03-22T11:53:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	silvaran	Xenguy , althought it's always good to have swap, you really don't need it with more ram.  The more ram you have, the less swap you really need, I'd say 512 is minimum though
2006-03-22T11:54:00.000Z	silvaran	FunnyLookinHat	THANK you...
