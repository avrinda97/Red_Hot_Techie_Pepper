2007-05-04T08:54:00.000Z	MenZa		Has anyone got any idea which SCSI driver the Intel SE7401BR2 Server Motherboard needs?
2007-05-04T08:56:00.000Z	sn0	MenZa	lspci should tell you how the system finds the chipset/scsi chip
2007-05-04T08:56:00.000Z	MenZa	sn0	I'm in the server installation. It finds none.
2007-05-04T08:57:00.000Z	sn0	MenZa	can you pastebin the output please?
2007-05-04T08:57:00.000Z	MenZa	sn0	eh, I have no output
2007-05-04T08:58:00.000Z	sn0	MenZa	ok so you are at the actual install screen, hmm are you installing feisty ?
2007-05-04T08:59:00.000Z	sn0	MenZa	try pressing ctrl+alt+f1 to get a console screen, then type lspci | more and press space to scroll down the text
2007-05-04T09:00:00.000Z	MenZa	sn0	I don't get a terminal.
2007-05-04T09:01:00.000Z	MenZa	sn0	It's... baffling to say the least
2007-05-04T09:02:00.000Z	sn0	MenZa	im not sure what to try next, if you have the latest desktop cd you could boot from that to try and discover the scsi information
2007-05-04T09:08:00.000Z	sn0	MenZa	 cool! something to work on then
2007-05-04T09:08:00.000Z	MenZa	sn0	yeah, let me check the controller's bios
2007-05-04T09:09:00.000Z	MenZa	sn0	the BIOS states that AIC-7901 at slot 00 03:03:00 is found
2007-05-04T09:12:00.000Z	sn0	MenZa	i believe that uses the aacraid module to support that chipset, can you run lsmod to check it loaded?
2007-05-04T09:12:00.000Z	MenZa	sn0	my only problem is this, the "boot splash", if you will, on the scsi controller, doesn't list the device,but when I enter its bios, it is shown
2007-05-04T09:12:00.000Z	MenZa	sn0	I rebooted out of it :/
2007-05-04T09:13:00.000Z	MenZa	sn0	I'll reboot back into the desktop then?
2007-05-04T09:13:00.000Z	sn0	MenZa	indeed
2007-05-04T09:18:00.000Z	MenZa	sn0	alright, what am I looking for?
2007-05-04T09:19:00.000Z	sn0	MenZa	ok can you pastebin what lsmod says, as well as sudo cat /proc/partitions and sudo fdisk -l
2007-05-04T09:20:00.000Z	MenZa	sn0	Ergh, I have no mouse attached to the box, so I can't really use a gui
2007-05-04T09:40:00.000Z	MenZa	sn0	how can I dump lsmod to a file?
2007-05-04T09:43:00.000Z	MenZa	sn0	there we go
2007-05-04T09:45:00.000Z	MenZa	sn0	pastebin is being very complaining
