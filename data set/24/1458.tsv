2010-04-13T01:37:00.000Z	Losha	allowoverride	I've burned many cds/dvds. The engineering tolerances nowadays are very tight and the manufacturers compete over price, so units do sometimes fail spontaneously, more so than they used to. Another possibility is poor media (are you really using some knock off Indian brand?). In your place, I would boot into windows and see if you can successfully burn from there...
2010-04-13T01:38:00.000Z	allowoverride	Losha	ok,, i understand... as for windows thats not possible
2010-04-13T01:38:00.000Z	allowoverride	Losha	if the host hardware is having issues, the VM wont work as a burner either
2010-04-13T01:40:00.000Z	Losha	allowoverride	well you really only have 2 choices to debug this: replace the hardware, or replace the software....
2010-04-13T01:42:00.000Z	Losha	allowoverride	burners are so standardised these days that they don't use special drivers. And buffer underrun should disappear if you burn at very slow speeds. Of all the hypotheses put forth so far, hardware failure of the burner is by far the most probable...
2010-04-13T01:48:00.000Z	allowoverride	Losha	im starting to agree there. i will have fun with Dell support on this one
2010-04-13T01:48:00.000Z	Losha	allowoverride	it's a laptop with a built-in cd drive?
2010-04-13T01:49:00.000Z	allowoverride	Losha	yes
2010-04-13T01:50:00.000Z	Losha	allowoverride	ok, the probability of a burner hardware failure just went up a lot. Miniaturised electronics plus bangs/drops/dents....
2010-04-13T01:50:00.000Z	allowoverride	Losha	there is no way anyone can say that unless they are an electrical engineer and have a lab to test it in.
2010-04-13T01:50:00.000Z	allowoverride	Losha	i am/have neither, and also, no bangs drops so forth here
2010-04-13T01:51:00.000Z	Losha	allowoverride	regardless, your next step is presumably to RMA the part (or the entire laptop) and see if that fixes the problem...
2010-04-13T01:52:00.000Z	allowoverride	Losha	no thanks have a good day
2010-04-13T01:52:00.000Z	Losha	allowoverride	a pleasure...
2010-04-15T06:51:00.000Z	Losha	allowoverride	what app are you using to burn?
2010-04-15T06:52:00.000Z	allowoverride	Losha	brasio
2010-04-15T06:52:00.000Z	allowoverride	Losha	a few others, all that don't work
2010-04-15T06:52:00.000Z	allowoverride	Losha	but dvd+r burns
2010-04-15T06:53:00.000Z	Losha	allowoverride	so what happens when you try and burn a cd?
2010-04-15T06:53:00.000Z	allowoverride	Losha	i think it might be all this time, the media or permissions
2010-04-15T06:53:00.000Z	allowoverride	Losha	i loose yet another disk
2010-04-15T06:54:00.000Z	allowoverride	Losha	but today i did a burn with dvd, it worked fine, but it did throw a error
2010-04-15T06:54:00.000Z	Losha	allowoverride	well, blank cds are dirt cheap (here in the US anyway). cdrecord has to run sudo I think...
2010-04-15T06:54:00.000Z	Losha	allowoverride	what is the error when you burn a cd?
