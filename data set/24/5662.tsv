2006-05-28T12:46:00.000Z	rixxon		can someone please tell me how the hell i managed to keep my interest in computers when using windows?!
2006-05-28T12:48:00.000Z	rixxon		will be interesting to see if i can install ubuntu on this laptop though
2006-05-28T12:48:00.000Z	rixxon		never succeed with any other linux
2006-05-28T12:48:00.000Z	rixxon		stupid special hardware
2006-05-28T12:48:00.000Z	rixxon		(probably more like stupid me but still)
2006-05-28T12:48:00.000Z	dli	rixxon	why it fails?
2006-05-28T12:49:00.000Z	dli	rixxon	japanese laptops seem to be anti-linux, sony or fujitsu
2006-05-28T12:49:00.000Z	dli	rixxon	then, you can get it :)
2006-05-28T12:54:00.000Z	rixxon	dli	what do you mean?
2006-05-28T12:55:00.000Z	dli	rixxon	if the livecd can get it, you can install
2006-05-28T12:56:00.000Z	rixxon	dli	i can run livecd, not install from
2006-05-28T12:56:00.000Z	rixxon	dli	installers don't find hard drive...
2006-05-28T12:57:00.000Z	rixxon	dli	haven't tried with ubuntu yet though
2006-05-28T12:57:00.000Z	dli	rixxon	can livecd see hdd?
2006-05-28T12:58:00.000Z	dli	rixxon	then, I can not help
2006-05-28T13:00:00.000Z	rixxon	dli	what do you mean if livecd sees hdd?
2006-05-28T13:00:00.000Z	rixxon	dli	i go to 'computer' in file browser, it lists my hard drive and knows its size; but i can't access it (which might be cause it is ntfs)
2006-05-28T13:00:00.000Z	rixxon	dli	i get unable to mount
2006-05-28T15:17:00.000Z	rixxon	dli	is it easy to use?
2006-05-28T15:18:00.000Z	dli	rixxon	you can install GUI version: gparted , or qtparted
2006-07-05T14:22:00.000Z	dli	rixxon	he doesn't read any doc :( that's the problem
2006-07-05T14:22:00.000Z	rixxon	dli	heh, didn't see his question
2006-07-05T16:21:00.000Z	dli	rixxon	libncurses5-dev
