2008-09-12T12:41:00.000Z	vag		hello. I have nvidia  8400M GS on an HP laptop, wiht ubuntu 8.04. I have installed the  NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-173.14.12   . When I restarted gdm everything was ok. But when I rebooted the pc it starts in low graphics mode 800x600. If I go and reinstall the drivers then after running gdm again everything is fine. But it seems that the settings aren't saved . Any ideas? I could provide any more info if you need it...
2008-09-12T12:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vag	you need to set some resolutions in xorg.conf
2008-09-12T12:44:00.000Z	vag	ActionParsnip	http://rafb.net/p/Oe4XrO33.html  here's the output of the xorg.conf . Any ideas where should I set the resolution? And why is the resolution correct when I build the drivers and then restart gdm. It doesn't work only after reboot
2008-09-12T12:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vag	http://pastebin.com/f594ec754 heres mine, i run at 1024x768
2008-09-12T12:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vag	add the resolution subsections from my screen section and you should be ok
2008-09-12T12:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vag	backup the original xorg.conf before playing
2008-09-12T12:47:00.000Z	vag	ActionParsnip	:) yes

2008-09-12T12:56:00.000Z	vag	ActionParsnip	I tried to insert some resolution to the xorg but no... after reinstalling the drivers it plays. After restarting gdm still nothing :(
2008-09-12T12:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vag	can i see your new xorg.conf please
2008-09-12T12:59:00.000Z	vag	ActionParsnip	http://rafb.net/p/nhKwJ298.html   I haven't edited the xorg.conf myself again so I might have done sth wrong...

2008-09-12T13:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vag	you added it in monitor, you need them in screen

2008-09-12T13:12:00.000Z	vag	ActionParsnip	hey, I treid somethings but it still doesn't work, no correct resolution,  http://pastebin.com/d518fffcf
2008-09-12T13:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vag	try adding _60 to the 1024x768 line
2008-09-12T13:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vag	make sure it joins
2008-09-12T13:16:00.000Z	vag	ActionParsnip	you mean like "1024x768_60" /
2008-09-12T13:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vag	yes
2008-09-12T13:20:00.000Z	vag	ActionParsnip	http://pastebin.com/m37007da0  still not correct resolution. Screen->preferences->screen resolution shows 1024x768 but 50 hz ...
2008-09-12T13:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vag	try a reboot
2008-09-12T13:32:00.000Z	vag	ActionParsnip	hi , after the reboot it was worse... the resolution is 800*600 (system->pref->screen resolution) And before getting in X I got a message that Display isn't setup. If I want to use higher resolution and effects I should manually edit my preferences... So the xorg.cong I currenty have is http://pastebin.com/d3b75ec2a  ... :(
