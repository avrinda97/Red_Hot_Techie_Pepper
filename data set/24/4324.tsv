2008-04-29T17:35:00.000Z	virus92		I installed some video drivers on my ubuntu. Now ubuntu doesn't load when you log in. How do I recover my ubuntu? I'm on a live now
2008-04-29T17:36:00.000Z	ikonia	virus92	can you use "recovery" mode from the grub menu on your ubuntu install ?
2008-04-29T17:36:00.000Z	virus92	ikonia	yes, I can
2008-04-29T17:37:00.000Z	ikonia	virus92	ok, use that, use the root shell and change the "driver" line in /etc/X11/xorg.conf to "vesa"
2008-04-29T17:41:00.000Z	virus92	ikonia	I can modify that file trough the live CD, I opened it right now. There's twice the driver word. One for Generic Keyboard and one for Configured Mouse
2008-04-29T17:42:00.000Z	ikonia	virus92	driver for video section
2008-04-29T17:42:00.000Z	ikonia	virus92	or boot into recovery mode shall and do "dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg"

2008-04-29T17:46:00.000Z	ikonia	virus92	(fail safe driver = vesa)
2008-04-29T17:49:00.000Z	virus92	ikonia	I first did it trough the default driver manager of ubuntu and it caused me black screen, then ireformatted and tried with a driver manager that someone has suggested to me
