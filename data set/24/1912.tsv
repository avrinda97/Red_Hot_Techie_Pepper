2012-05-28T17:14:00.000Z	jasonbourne		how to change the boot sequence on startup....need to have the CD/DVD be first in line...where do I look/set this option?? Thanks in advance...
2012-05-28T17:15:00.000Z	jasonbourne		I guess BIOS still accessible via F1 option on boot-up??
2012-05-28T17:16:00.000Z	jasonbourne		thanks, john00...will try both options...
2012-05-28T17:18:00.000Z	jasonbourne		yeah I could go to HP's website...I've seen it there...
2012-05-28T17:18:00.000Z	jasonbourne		problem I'm having is getting BackTrack 5 to boot on my HP laptop...
2012-05-28T17:19:00.000Z	jasonbourne		so I figured maybe setting the CD/DVD drive to boot first might correct the problem...
2012-05-28T17:19:00.000Z	ikonia	jasonbourne	the guys in #backtracklinux can help with that
2012-05-28T17:19:00.000Z	ikonia	jasonbourne	sorry, #backtrack-linux
2012-05-28T17:20:00.000Z	ikonia	jasonbourne	they will get there, hang in with them
2012-05-28T17:20:00.000Z	ikonia	jasonbourne	plus, I'm in the channel and I don't see you asking in that channel in the last 7 days
2012-05-28T17:21:00.000Z	ikonia	jasonbourne	ok, so try their channel as I've just told you
2012-05-28T17:22:00.000Z	ikonia	jasonbourne	type "/join #backtrack-linux"
2012-07-15T00:44:00.000Z	jasonbourne	ikonia	- you say its looking for trouble when I know that it's possible...
2012-07-15T00:42:00.000Z	ikonia	jasonbourne	1.) it's called "Windows" not "windoze"
2012-07-15T00:43:00.000Z	ikonia	jasonbourne	2.) I'd advise you not to depend on Wine to run games on linux, my view is that Windows games are designed to run on Windows, and trying to use them on other operating systems/depending on a solution is just trouble
2012-07-15T00:43:00.000Z	ikonia	jasonbourne	I'd advise you to stay clear of PlayOnLinux and Wine as a solution for games
2012-07-15T00:43:00.000Z	jasonbourne	ikonia	- sorry but your wrong because I know it's possible just don't know how to do it...
2012-07-15T00:44:00.000Z	ikonia	jasonbourne	what do you mean "I'm wrong"
2012-07-15T00:44:00.000Z	ikonia	jasonbourne	I didn't say it wasn't possible
2012-07-15T00:44:00.000Z	ikonia	jasonbourne	there are abstraction layers tools such as "wine" (playonlinux is a front end to that)
2012-07-15T00:45:00.000Z	ikonia	jasonbourne	however depending on them is not a solution as not all games work, games can work badly, games can work fine one day, then not work at all the next day, hence depending on the solution is "looking for trouble"
2012-07-15T00:45:00.000Z	ikonia	jasonbourne	the guys in #winehq can walk you through your wine journey should you choose to progress it
2012-07-15T00:46:00.000Z	jasonbourne	ikonia	- exactly...so where do I go to get it running?? I had PlayOnLinux installed on this laptop when I had OpenSUSE on it but could not figure out how to get it running...
2012-07-15T00:46:00.000Z	jasonbourne	ikonia	- I'll try there...
