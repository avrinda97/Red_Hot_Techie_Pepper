2007-06-17T10:12:00.000Z	Trini_Man	Gnea	: ok i did a fresh install of 7.04 on my dell and i get a X server error
2007-06-17T10:12:00.000Z	Gnea	Trini_Man	did it just show up in the mail? was ubuntu pre-installed? did X work or did it arrive broken?
2007-06-17T10:12:00.000Z	Gnea	Trini_Man	aaah... why the reinstall?
2007-06-17T10:12:00.000Z	Trini_Man	Gnea	: no i did not buy the ubunut Dells
2007-06-17T10:13:00.000Z	Trini_Man	Gnea	: it had windows on it
2007-06-17T10:13:00.000Z	Gnea	Trini_Man	do you still have the restore partition on it?
2007-06-17T10:13:00.000Z	Trini_Man	Gnea	: i want to put ubuntu on my laptop
2007-06-17T10:13:00.000Z	Gnea	Trini_Man	do you still have the restore partition on it?
2007-06-17T10:14:00.000Z	Trini_Man	Gnea	: yes
2007-06-17T10:14:00.000Z	Trini_Man	Gnea	: why ?
2007-06-17T10:14:00.000Z	Trini_Man	Gnea	: yes
2007-06-17T10:15:00.000Z	Gnea	Trini_Man	just making sure (i used to work for Dell, there isn't much about the E1505 that i don't know, other than i don't own one)
2007-06-17T10:16:00.000Z	Gnea	Trini_Man	did you install the livecd already or is the X error occuring after the install?
2007-06-17T10:17:00.000Z	Trini_Man	Gnea	 adter install
2007-06-17T10:17:00.000Z	Gnea	Trini_Man	sounds like X just needs to be reconfigured then
