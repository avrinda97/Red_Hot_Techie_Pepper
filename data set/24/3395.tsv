2008-01-31T22:56:00.000Z	chris710		please,how can i install my theme gtk 2 with emerald?
2008-01-31T22:57:00.000Z	lrkr	chris710	you're using emerald as your decorator and want to install a new gtk theme?
2008-01-31T23:00:00.000Z	lrkr	chris710	once you've downloaded the .tar.gz theme, open up your system-->preferences-->appearance menu, and drag and drop it into there
2008-01-31T23:02:00.000Z	lrkr	chris710	wait, are you trying to install a gtk theme or a emerald theme?
2008-01-31T23:03:00.000Z	lrkr	chris710	sorry about the slow typing, my fingers are taped together
2008-01-31T23:03:00.000Z	lrkr	chris710	to install the gtk theme, the path i gave you should be sufficient
2008-01-31T23:03:00.000Z	lrkr	chris710	since emerald is only theming the window decorator
2008-01-31T23:04:00.000Z	lrkr	chris710	mmm, should as far as i know; here, lemme test (and btw it's Lrkr..type lr then tab and i should be the only one)
2008-01-31T23:04:00.000Z	lrkr	chris710	you're on xkcfe-look.org?
2008-01-31T23:07:00.000Z	lrkr	chris710	yeah, i was right; to install a gtk theme, go to system--->preferences--->appearance, then drag and drop the theme file into that window and it should install
2008-01-31T23:07:00.000Z	lrkr	chris710	that should be all you need to do; emerald only skins the top of the dinwo
2008-01-31T23:07:00.000Z	lrkr	chris710	*window
2008-01-31T23:09:00.000Z	lrkr	chris710	well, they do, they both just skin different things.
2008-01-31T23:09:00.000Z	lrkr	chris710	is the file you downloaded a .tar.gz file or a .emerald file?
2008-01-31T23:11:00.000Z	lrkr	chris710	okay, to install that just go to system-->preferences--->emerald theme manager, open that
2008-01-31T23:11:00.000Z	lrkr	chris710	then hit "import" and direct it to the file you downloaded
2008-01-31T23:13:00.000Z	lrkr	chris710	did that work?
2008-01-31T23:16:00.000Z	lrkr	chris710	what happened?
2008-01-31T23:17:00.000Z	lrkr	chris710	once you have the emerald theme manager open, under the "themes" tab, there should be a list of themes. Click on the one you want to use to select it.
2008-01-31T23:18:00.000Z	lrkr	chris710	hmmm, try going into your compiz settings and checking what your window decorator is
2008-01-31T23:19:00.000Z	lrkr	chris710	no problem, hope that works
2008-01-31T23:21:00.000Z	lrkr	chris710	mmmmm, i'm not entirely sure (i compiz), but my guess is once you find the place where you have the set of options, try to find a way to choose emerald(?) sorry i can't help anymore.
2008-01-31T23:22:00.000Z	lrkr	chris710	to get more specific advice on this, you might want to check the ubuntu forums, there's a lot of information there about these kinds of issues, specifically with compiz/emerald/etc.
2008-01-31T23:24:00.000Z	lrkr	chris710	sorry, i've got to get going, good luck with your problem!
