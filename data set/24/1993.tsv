2009-06-15T02:46:00.000Z	zagabar		my ubuntu server is unbootable. I had it completely working, then I moved and when trying to fire it up in my new place, it says "Kernel panic - not syncing: Attempted to kill the idle task!" Anyone knows what might cause this and how to fix it?
2009-06-15T02:47:00.000Z	texasjack	zagabar	maybe your HD was beaten up in the move...
2009-06-15T02:51:00.000Z	zagabar	texasjack	That sounds horrible. D: How can I tell?
2009-06-15T02:51:00.000Z	texasjack	zagabar	your computer is booting?
2009-06-15T02:53:00.000Z	zagabar	texasjack	it boots up bios and while trying to load GRUB it changes to an error screen that tells me "kernel panic: sync loss"
2009-06-15T02:54:00.000Z	texasjack	zagabar	I'm not a kernel guru, but that sound really bad. =)
2009-06-15T02:55:00.000Z	zagabar	texasjack	Indeed it does...
2009-06-15T02:58:00.000Z	texasjack	zagabar	<CTRL>+<ALT>+<F1>, then «sudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.zagabar.backup»
2009-06-15T02:59:00.000Z	texasjack	zagabar	then «sudo vim /etc/X11/xorg.conf» and go to the "Device" section.
2009-06-15T03:04:00.000Z	zagabar	texasjack	Hm, I tried to do what you said. Firstly, I couldn't switch to text only with ctrl + shift + F1 while stuck in the colour mess, so I rebooted it and pressed ctrl + shift + F1 while loading the OS and then it switched successfully and eventually got to a login prompt. However, about 5 seconds after, the screen changed to the colour mess again. It looks like a random mess on the down half of the screen, and on the other half, 
2009-06-15T03:06:00.000Z	texasjack	zagabar	its <CTRL>+<ALT>+<F1>, not <SHIFT>...
2009-06-15T03:07:00.000Z	zagabar	texasjack	Oh, yeah, that is what I meant.
2009-06-15T03:14:00.000Z	zagabar	texasjack	 Do you know how to fix it?
2009-06-15T03:15:00.000Z	texasjack	zagabar	fix what?  I tell you everything to start a fix...
2009-06-15T03:16:00.000Z	zagabar	texasjack	That problem with my laptop getting stuck at a graphical mess. I tried to do what you said by switching to text mode with ctrl alt F1, but shortly after the ogin prompt appeared, I got the mess again.
2009-06-15T03:20:00.000Z	texasjack	zagabar	ok... Let's calm down...
2009-06-15T03:21:00.000Z	texasjack	zagabar	boot in Recovery mode.  It will not start X.
2009-06-15T03:21:00.000Z	zagabar	texasjack	how?
2009-06-15T03:22:00.000Z	texasjack	zagabar	when you boot, grub shows you a menu, it's hidden by default, hit <ESC> and it will show up.
2009-06-15T03:28:00.000Z	zagabar	texasjack	Okay, I managed to start a recovery mode and I am now in the xorg.conf file in the device section. What to do now to revert the driver? =)
2009-06-15T03:29:00.000Z	texasjack	zagabar	change the line where says "Driver   XXXXX" with some driver that will work... Maybe  "intel", or in ultimate case use "vesa".
2009-06-15T03:31:00.000Z	zagabar	texasjack	 it currently says "fglrx". How can I know which ones exits? I have a ATI radeon mobility x600 I think.
2009-06-15T03:34:00.000Z	texasjack	zagabar	I don't know nothing about ATI drivers.  Just know that have some issues...  Ask for anyone else...  Sorry, brother tux, but this time, my knowledge can't help you.
2009-06-15T03:35:00.000Z	zagabar	texasjack	Don't feel down, fellow lad! You have done enough for a life time already! Go and ease your weary old supportive hands!  Thanks! =)
