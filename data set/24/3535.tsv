2008-02-01T06:41:00.000Z	xomp		can someone explain how I have 2 battery notifications on my laptop, 1 (battery charge monitor) says I have over 3 hours of battery left 99% charged, the other (power management) says I have 55 minutes left 97% charged? (x3)
2008-02-01T06:42:00.000Z	Cpudan80	xomp	The 55 minute one is for the time remaining till full charge, ignore it
2008-02-01T06:43:00.000Z	xomp	Cpudan80	thanks :)
2008-02-01T06:43:00.000Z	Cpudan80	xomp	The discharge meters are pretty accurate though
2008-02-01T06:43:00.000Z	xomp	Cpudan80	I've been dealing with battery issues for several months now and got a 3rd replacement battery, was curious why ubuntu was reporting different times, thought maybe this battery was snafu too!
2008-02-01T06:44:00.000Z	Cpudan80	xomp	Nah prob not
2008-02-01T06:44:00.000Z	Cpudan80	xomp	Your BIOS probably limits charging above a certain % too (why it says 55 minutes vs say 10)
2008-02-01T06:45:00.000Z	xomp	Cpudan80	I think it does, there is an option to "calibrate battery" in there that makes no sense to me.
2008-02-01T06:46:00.000Z	xomp	Cpudan80	would you know why I can't ping my workstation by netbios name when I connect over VPN?
2008-02-01T06:46:00.000Z	xomp	Cpudan80	I can ping the workstations IP, but not netbios name.
2008-02-01T06:47:00.000Z	Cpudan80	xomp	Yeah, Ubuntu does the DNS stuff differently than windows, prob nothing you can do about it
2008-02-01T06:48:00.000Z	xomp	Cpudan80	yeah, I was thinking ubuntu couldn't see the alt. dns names for our domain.
2008-02-01T06:48:00.000Z	Cpudan80	xomp	you could add the DNS server to your list --- not sure what that would do if its not available (ie not connected)
2008-02-01T06:48:00.000Z	xomp	Cpudan80	the weird thing is I can ping.. say our MS Exchange server by netbios name, but not my workstation lol
2008-02-01T06:48:00.000Z	Cpudan80	xomp	System --> Admin --> Networking --> DNS
2008-02-01T06:49:00.000Z	Cpudan80	xomp	add the DNS server
2008-02-01T06:50:00.000Z	xomp	Cpudan80	thanks, I'll give it a try now. My apologize if I disconnect from here (as it usually does when I connect to VPNc) Thanks so much for the help :)
2008-05-03T22:27:00.000Z	Cpudan80	xomp	Open the EXE with the archive viewer thing
2008-05-03T22:27:00.000Z	xomp	Cpudan80	ok, thanks :D
2008-05-03T22:28:00.000Z	xomp	Cpudan80	archive manager can't open it :(
2008-05-03T22:29:00.000Z	Cpudan80	xomp	winrar can open it
2008-05-03T22:29:00.000Z	Cpudan80	xomp	See if you can run that in wine or something
2008-05-03T22:29:00.000Z	Cpudan80	xomp	Ask one of the guys in ##windows to open it and extract the INF for you
2008-05-03T22:29:00.000Z	xomp	Cpudan80	hehe ok
