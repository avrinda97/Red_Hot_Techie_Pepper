2009-09-01T22:31:00.000Z	Msku		ok killall gnome-app-install seemed to do the job
2009-09-01T22:31:00.000Z	Msku		thanks
2009-09-01T22:31:00.000Z	Msku		but, what does it do?
2009-09-01T22:32:00.000Z	Msku		ctr+alt+d
2009-09-01T22:32:00.000Z	Msku		oh, so gnome-app-install is the name of the process?
2009-09-01T22:32:00.000Z	Msku		np
2009-09-01T22:32:00.000Z	Msku		okay
2009-09-01T22:32:00.000Z	Msku		but
2009-09-01T22:33:00.000Z	Msku		ok
2009-09-01T22:34:00.000Z	Msku		I'm gonna ask this again, since no one replied. Is there any way I can resize my partition? I just installed Ubuntu and the partition is obviously full, even though I haven't installed any programs or anything yet. I can't even open Firefox (it says I need to clear some disk space, god knows why). I don't have disk space to install Gparted :/
2009-09-01T22:36:00.000Z	guntbert	Msku	did you install from booting with the CD or are you using wubi?
2009-09-01T22:37:00.000Z	Msku	guntbert	question was for you I guess :p
2009-09-01T22:38:00.000Z	guntbert	Msku	please !pastebin the output of sudo fdisk -l and of df -h
2009-09-01T22:39:00.000Z	Msku	guntbert	I cant open the web browser, too little disk space, lol
2009-09-01T22:40:00.000Z	Msku	guntbert	so I cant open the pastebin :/
2009-09-01T22:40:00.000Z	guntbert	Msku	I see - let me think
2009-09-01T22:41:00.000Z	Msku	guntbert	want me to msg you ? It's not that many lines of text
2009-09-01T22:42:00.000Z	guntbert	Msku	ok, go ahead
2009-09-01T22:44:00.000Z	guntbert	Msku	and now df -h please too
2009-09-01T22:46:00.000Z	guntbert	Msku	the problem is: your / partition (/dev/sda5 has only 2GB), that *is* too low
2009-09-01T22:46:00.000Z	Msku	guntbert	I see, any way I can change that without reinstalling?
2009-09-01T22:48:00.000Z	guntbert	Msku	lets put it so: are there any important data in your installation?
2009-09-01T22:51:00.000Z	guntbert	Msku	yes, I have seen weird things in the installer now and then - my best advice would be to reinstall (from booting the CD, *not* from windows), and take a good look at the proposed partitioning scheme
2009-09-01T22:54:00.000Z	guntbert	Msku	on the partitioning page you see the proposal at the bottom, in there there is a small white symbol, you can drag that, but I would advice that you first boot into the live system
