2010-08-19T07:02:00.000Z	segaloco		its something with the EFI, choosing boot devices is... different
2010-08-19T07:03:00.000Z	segaloco		simple is too boring for me though >:D
2010-08-19T07:03:00.000Z	segaloco		thats why im replacing a ton of the major system components from source
2010-08-19T07:04:00.000Z	segaloco		what version?
2010-08-19T07:04:00.000Z	segaloco		shutdown if its the same as mine
2010-08-19T07:04:00.000Z	segaloco		then again ive replaced so much from source its not even right to call it ubuntu anymore :P
2010-08-19T07:05:00.000Z	segaloco		:D first build test is successful on gcc
2010-08-19T07:05:00.000Z	segaloco		speaking of distros and whatnot, ive always wondered, could lfs be built from mac os x? or does it have to be a linux kernel
2010-08-19T07:06:00.000Z	segaloco		yeah, sorta :P
2010-08-19T07:06:00.000Z	segaloco		bsd isnt linux though, its bsd xD
2010-08-19T07:06:00.000Z	syn-ack	segaloco	has to be a linux based host, though it's offtopic
2010-08-19T07:08:00.000Z	segaloco	syn-ack	darwin is bsd based :P
2010-08-19T07:08:00.000Z	syn-ack	segaloco	not completely
2010-08-19T07:08:00.000Z	syn-ack	segaloco	it's got a mach kernel
2010-08-19T07:09:00.000Z	segaloco	syn-ack	yeah, i was about to say that, busy talking to Xuzz dX
2010-08-19T07:15:00.000Z	segaloco	syn-ack	got it before they pulled it :P
2010-08-19T07:31:00.000Z	syn-ack	segaloco	No. ATI is evil.
2010-08-19T07:34:00.000Z	segaloco	syn-ack	is gnome 3 even ready?
2010-08-19T07:34:00.000Z	syn-ack	segaloco	no, they were banking on tho
2010-08-19T07:34:00.000Z	syn-ack	segaloco	it's still very much under development
2010-08-19T07:39:00.000Z	syn-ack	segaloco	careful when you start messing with the toolchain
2010-08-19T07:47:00.000Z	syn-ack	segaloco	Testing? Are you beyond it bootstrapping it's self?
2010-08-19T07:48:00.000Z	syn-ack	segaloco	ah, gotcha
2010-08-19T07:49:00.000Z	syn-ack	segaloco	still have fun when you completely and utterly break your toolchain. :D
