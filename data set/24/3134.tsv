2008-05-19T23:07:00.000Z	cypha		is it possible to see what configuration files have been changed from doing an apt-get install?
2008-05-19T23:08:00.000Z	cypha		no, sorry
2008-05-19T23:09:00.000Z	bullium	cypha	sudo cat /var/log/apt/term.log
2008-05-19T23:09:00.000Z	cypha		what will that do bullium?
2008-05-19T23:09:00.000Z	cypha		what's cat?
2008-05-19T23:10:00.000Z	cypha		concatenate?
2008-05-19T23:10:00.000Z	cypha		the hell does that mean
2008-05-19T23:10:00.000Z	cypha		lol
2008-05-19T23:10:00.000Z	bullium		basically echos the file to stdout (the screen)
2008-05-19T23:10:00.000Z	cypha		stdout is what the config files refer to as the screen?
2008-05-19T23:10:00.000Z	bullium	cypha	basically it displays the file on screen...scrolls to the end of the file
2008-05-19T23:10:00.000Z	bullium	cypha	in your case it will be the apt log
2008-05-19T23:11:00.000Z	cypha	bullium	u mean term.log?
2008-05-19T23:11:00.000Z	bullium	cypha	yep
2008-05-19T23:11:00.000Z	bullium	cypha	sudo cat /var/log/apt/term.log | less
2008-05-19T23:11:00.000Z	cypha		k, jburd
