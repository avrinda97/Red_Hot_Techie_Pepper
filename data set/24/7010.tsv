2005-05-25T10:47:00.000Z	{Seb}		hey all
2005-05-25T10:47:00.000Z	{Seb}		is there a breezy development channel?
2005-05-25T10:47:00.000Z	{Seb}		i've found a bug in a breezy package
2005-05-25T10:47:00.000Z	Amaranth	{Seb}	If it's in main file a bug report in bugzilla; if it's in universe file a bug report in malone.
2005-05-25T10:48:00.000Z	{Seb}		malone?
2005-05-25T10:49:00.000Z	Amaranth	{Seb}	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Lech_Johansen
2005-05-25T10:49:00.000Z	Amaranth		err, wrong
2005-05-25T10:49:00.000Z	Amaranth		damn clipboard
2005-05-25T10:49:00.000Z	Amaranth		damn firefox, copy
2005-05-25T10:49:00.000Z	{Seb}	Amaranth	just that the new Tomboy 0.3.2 package requires upon dbus-1 and breezy uses dbus not dbus-1
2005-05-25T10:50:00.000Z	{Seb}	Amaranth	apart from that, breezy has been smooth riding
2005-05-25T10:50:00.000Z	Amaranth	{Seb}	known issue, won't be fixed for a couple weeks, at least
2005-05-25T10:50:00.000Z	{Seb}		Amarnath: will it work with a --force ?
2005-05-25T10:50:00.000Z	Amaranth	{Seb}	Do _NOT_ upgrade anymore, unless you like pain and broken things.
2005-05-25T10:51:00.000Z	{Seb}		just i need mono 1.1.7 and firefox 1.0.4 and the backports is soo low
2005-05-25T10:51:00.000Z	Amaranth	{Seb}	No, the dbus API has completely changed, libdbus-cil needs to be changed to match it then tomboy needs to be changed to match the libdbus-cil API.
2005-05-25T10:51:00.000Z	{Seb}		i can install tomboy 0.3.2 on hoary
2005-05-25T10:51:00.000Z	Amaranth	{Seb}	C++ transition in happening in breezy, random broken C++ things
2005-05-25T10:51:00.000Z	{Seb}		just backports takes hours for mono 1.1.7
2005-05-25T10:52:00.000Z	{Seb}		i'll stick to hoary
2005-05-25T10:52:00.000Z	Amaranth	{Seb}	obviously, hoary doesn't have the new dbus
2005-05-25T10:52:00.000Z	{Seb}		and just wait for mono 11.7 to come through....
2005-05-25T10:52:00.000Z	{Seb}		yeh, but i've tried it and it works
2005-05-25T10:52:00.000Z	Amaranth	{Seb}	obviously, hoary doesn't have the new dbus
