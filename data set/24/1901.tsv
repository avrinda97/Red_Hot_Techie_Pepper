2009-06-30T00:55:00.000Z	kushite		Ubuntu 9.04 - the Jaunty Jackalope i cannot enable the advanced visual settings because ubuntu cannot find any drivers for my  Intel Graphics Media Accelerator 950
2009-06-30T00:59:00.000Z	kushite		ok so i cannot even enable the normal desktop effects. its as if there is no driver installed for my Intel Graphics Media Accelerator 950. how can i check or re-install the driver?

2009-06-30T01:04:00.000Z	gangil	kushite	also check this site ubuntugeek.com , it can solve many of your ubuntu newbies problem
2009-06-30T01:04:00.000Z	gangil	kushite	I dont think you can enable even normal effects
2009-06-30T01:04:00.000Z	gangil		as simple as that
2009-06-30T01:05:00.000Z	kushite	gangil	because of the weak graphics card? or because i dont have a graphics card installed
2009-06-30T01:06:00.000Z	gangil	kushite	you need something like ATI or nvidia for desktop effects , but I am not a pro like many out here , better crosscheck ...
