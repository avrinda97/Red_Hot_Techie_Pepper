2007-05-27T11:44:00.000Z	Flannel	Arex	what does logmein do?
2007-05-27T11:45:00.000Z	Flannel	Arex	that's an activeX control I believe.  So you won't be able to do that.  Luckily, Linux provides many other options ot login to remote PCs
2007-05-27T11:56:00.000Z	Arex	Flannel	are you there?
2007-05-27T11:56:00.000Z	Flannel	Arex	I am
2007-05-27T11:57:00.000Z	Flannel	Arex	that's what I said.
2007-05-27T11:59:00.000Z	Flannel	Arex	there are a few methods, VNC, RDP.  RDP requires no additional software on windows.
2007-05-27T12:00:00.000Z	Arex	Flannel	could you give me a wiki or something to set one of them up
2007-05-27T12:01:00.000Z	Flannel	Arex	Unfortunately no.  there doesn't seem to be anything in the wiki about it.  You might search the forums, if not there, google.
2007-05-27T12:05:00.000Z	Flannel	Arex	Here's stuff for VN
2007-05-27T12:05:00.000Z	Flannel	Arex	VNC: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=454735&highlight=Remote+Desktop+Windows
2007-06-02T08:47:00.000Z	Flannel	Arex	Don't chmod it, just become super user to add the stuff.
2007-06-02T09:10:00.000Z	Flannel	Arex	Whats wrong with the flash from the repositories?
2007-06-02T09:10:00.000Z	Arex	Flannel	Every single time I run flash, firefox crashes, so doesnt all other browsers
2007-06-02T09:14:00.000Z	Flannel	Arex	You've been given the answer multiple times.  Please stop.
2007-06-02T09:14:00.000Z	Arex	Flannel	NOBODY will explain to me what exactly to do!!
2007-06-02T09:14:00.000Z	Flannel	Arex	`which firefox`
2007-06-02T09:17:00.000Z	Flannel	Arex	We've told you.  `which firefox` will give you the path.  Please stop asking.
2007-06-02T09:17:00.000Z	Flannel	Arex	You're not listening.  We can't help you if you refuse to cooperate.  `which firefox` will give you the path of your FF, which you can then give the installer.
2007-06-02T09:18:00.000Z	Flannel	Arex	In any terminal.
2007-06-02T09:20:00.000Z	Arex	Flannel	I put 'which firefox' into a new terminal, it gave me a path, I entered the path on the installer, and it said this: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/23677/
2007-06-02T09:21:00.000Z	Flannel	Arex	it's looking for just the directory.  Not the file.  You want simply /usr/bin it seems.
