2010-11-08T16:01:00.000Z	ndxtg	airtonix	greppy: got it, thanks :D
2010-11-11T13:30:00.000Z	airtonix	ndxtg	you shouldn't.
2010-11-11T13:31:00.000Z	ndxtg	airtonix	any reason?
2010-11-11T13:33:00.000Z	airtonix	ndxtg	because you can't go from 9.04 to 10,10
2010-11-11T13:33:00.000Z	ndxtg	airtonix	oh really?? so is it possible to upgrade from 9.04 to 10.04 ?
2010-11-11T13:34:00.000Z	ndxtg	airtonix	never mind, I've just googled it. Know the reason now, must go each-by-each distribution
2010-11-11T13:35:00.000Z	airtonix	ndxtg	i recommend you 1) back up your home folder. (and any other data). 2) do a clean install of 10,10 3) plan the partitions like so : 1-swap(no mountpoint) : 2g, 2-system (mount: / ) 20gb  3-home (mount: /home ) the rest of the drive space.
2010-11-11T13:35:00.000Z	airtonix	ndxtg	also, only do a dist-upgrade if you want to play with broken debris.
2010-11-11T13:37:00.000Z	airtonix	ndxtg	you might have no problems or you might end up with a totally broken system.... a clean install with that partition plan will help you do future clean installs far more easil and more reliably than any dist-upgrade will.
2010-11-11T13:37:00.000Z	ndxtg	airtonix	because I have a lot of settings (i.e. thunder bird email accounts, shortcuts to network drive, compiz, cairo, firefox addons etc.)... cannot install from scratch now... it may take a month to re-config these things
2010-11-11T13:37:00.000Z	airtonix	ndxtg	all those settings are in your home folder
2010-11-11T13:38:00.000Z	airtonix	ndxtg	you'll have to do them from scratch anyway if your upgrade fails ... a stitch in time saves nince
2010-11-11T13:39:00.000Z	airtonix	ndxtg	up to you really... im just sayin... since you want to end up at 10.10 you'll be enduring the gamble of two upgrades
2010-11-11T13:42:00.000Z	ndxtg	airtonix	the reasons I want to update is because 9.04 hang on shutdown (network drives not unmounted thing), even they are unmounted, system may hang sometimes.... also Wifi drops randomly if overloading ~30MB/s
2010-11-11T13:43:00.000Z	airtonix	ndxtg	they're good reasons... but i *highly* recommend that you put /home on a separate partition so that you simply skip all this upgrade nonsense and simply clean install (and tell the installer to use you old home partition as the new home)
2010-11-11T13:45:00.000Z	ndxtg	airtonix	have never tried before because I thought if I install thunderbird for an example, it may not realise the thing inside /home folder, and so other programs
2010-11-11T13:45:00.000Z	airtonix	ndxtg	well that's where it puts its settings in the first place.
2010-11-11T13:47:00.000Z	ndxtg	airtonix	ok let me try, thank you :D
2010-11-11T13:51:00.000Z	airtonix	ndxtg	its how i moved from 9.10 to 10,04 and after i installed 10,04 my desktop looked *exactly* like it did in 9.10... if you didnt sit through the install you;d think i didn't have a new version.
2010-11-11T13:54:00.000Z	ndxtg	airtonix	that looks promising :D backing up now
2010-11-11T13:56:00.000Z	airtonix	ndxtg	the difference between dist-upgrade and clean installs with separate partition is that you will *always* end up with a usable operating system... but if you rely on dist-upgrade... its a gamble
