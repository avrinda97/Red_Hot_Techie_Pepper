2010-04-07T13:58:00.000Z	crash1hd		hmm I had to reinstall windows and now I can no longer connect to my ubuntu box through putty says I am missing a ppk file
2010-04-07T13:59:00.000Z	crash1hd		I dont seem to have this file anywhere backed up\
2010-04-07T13:59:00.000Z	theadmin	crash1hd	We don't support Windows here.
2010-04-07T13:59:00.000Z	crash1hd	theadmin	funny but the issue i am having is with the ssh ppk file for ubuntu not windows
2011-10-08T14:19:00.000Z	theadmin	crash1hd	You should leave at least 100MB for /boot, imo
2011-10-08T14:19:00.000Z	theadmin	crash1hd	Just saying
2011-10-08T14:20:00.000Z	crash1hd	theadmin	I set it to 250mb
2011-10-08T14:20:00.000Z	theadmin	crash1hd	Will do well.
2011-10-08T14:20:00.000Z	crash1hd	theadmin	the 20mb is for the efi
2011-10-08T14:20:00.000Z	theadmin	crash1hd	I'm not sure how the EFI works -- does it need a separate partition?
2011-10-08T14:20:00.000Z	crash1hd	theadmin	it seems to need to be at the very front of the drive
2011-10-08T21:31:00.000Z	theadmin	crash1hd	Probably some big udev/automount problem
2011-10-08T21:32:00.000Z	crash1hd	theadmin	any idea how to fix?
2011-10-08T21:32:00.000Z	theadmin	crash1hd	Just report a bug, cross your fingers and hope for it
2011-10-08T21:34:00.000Z	crash1hd	theadmin	hmm there is nothing I can try like reinstalling or adding somethinng to fstab? cause I mean I was able to install ubuntu via cd
2011-10-08T21:34:00.000Z	theadmin	crash1hd	No idea, really, if we could get some logs on wtf is happening when you insert a CD, dmesg perhaps...
2011-10-08T21:37:00.000Z	crash1hd	theadmin	hmm it seems that pastie.org does not like text larger then 64k
2011-10-08T21:38:00.000Z	theadmin	crash1hd	Try pzt.me, I always use that one... And we don't need all of it, just the parts which happen after you insert the cd
2011-10-08T21:39:00.000Z	crash1hd	theadmin	ok http://paste.ubuntu.com/704541
2011-10-08T21:40:00.000Z	crash1hd	theadmin	sorry that it is the whole thing but I have no idea where to look
2011-10-08T21:43:00.000Z	theadmin	crash1hd	It looks normal, unless I missed something (it's huge)
2011-10-08T21:43:00.000Z	crash1hd	theadmin	it is huge and no it looks normal to me too
2011-10-08T21:45:00.000Z	crash1hd	theadmin	also shouldnt there be something in the fstab?
2011-10-08T21:45:00.000Z	theadmin	crash1hd	No, CD-ROMS aren't static
