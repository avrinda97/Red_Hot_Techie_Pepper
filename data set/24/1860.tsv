2009-07-24T03:32:00.000Z	eggenz7		i have a intrepid install that was working beautifully...then yesterday i powerdown to move it to its permanant living quarters...now when i power up it get "boot from (hd0,0) ext *UUID#'s*
2009-07-24T03:32:00.000Z	eggenz7		then it says "Starting up ..." and it never loads
2009-07-24T03:33:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	eggenz7	Are you *sure* it is using the right UUID(s)?
2009-07-24T03:33:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	eggenz7	are you in a live session on that machine?
2009-07-24T03:34:00.000Z	eggenz7	Mike_lifeguard	i can get a grub prompt yes
2009-07-24T03:34:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	eggenz7	also, what do you mean by "move it to its permanent living quarters"?
2009-07-24T03:34:00.000Z	eggenz7	Mike_lifeguard	instead of beside my desk it goes into a closet
2009-07-24T03:34:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	eggenz7	that's not a live session, but I think you can still get the uuids from there... let me remember how
2009-07-24T03:35:00.000Z	eggenz7	Mike_lifeguard	i sure hope so..it might take an hour to get a live cd booted..the cdrom on this thing sucks
2009-07-24T03:35:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	eggenz7	if you type help is there a uuid command?
2009-07-24T03:36:00.000Z	eggenz7	Mike_lifeguard	yes..it says "uuid UUID"
2009-07-24T03:37:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	eggenz7	experiment with that? It should be able to print out the uuids for your system (but I'm not sure how easy it'll be to tell which one you should be booting from)
2009-07-24T03:37:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	eggenz7	if need be, you can just have it search for stage2 on each uuid in turn :\
2009-07-24T03:40:00.000Z	eggenz7	Mike_lifeguard	UUID's match...
2009-07-24T03:41:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	eggenz7	k, remind me where it gets stuck while booting?
2009-07-24T03:42:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	eggenz7	I had that problem once, but give me a moment to see if I can remember what I did to fix it... (I could have sworn it was messed up uuids) :\
2009-07-24T03:42:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	eggenz7	Have you tried dropping to grub prompt and manaully booting it?
2009-07-24T03:44:00.000Z	eggenz7	Mike_lifeguard	same thing....it really acts like a kernel problem but i have no idea how to get into it ot fix it
2009-07-24T03:45:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	eggenz7	doesn't sound like a kernel problem to me... you'll normally get good error info for those
2009-07-24T03:46:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	eggenz7	So, when you try to boot manually, what happens?
2009-07-24T03:47:00.000Z	eggenz7	Mike_lifeguard	it says the same thing as if it were to boot on its own, "Boot from (hd0,0) ext3 *UIDD*                               Starting up ...."
2009-07-24T03:47:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	eggenz7	Sorry, I don't know what the problem is :(
2009-07-24T03:55:00.000Z	eggenz7	Mike_lifeguard	is there any other options that i can do with a live cd?
2009-07-24T03:55:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	eggenz7	you could look at your menu.lst and/or /etc/fstab
