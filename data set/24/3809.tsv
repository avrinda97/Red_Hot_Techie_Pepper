2008-04-24T01:45:00.000Z	Sh4wn		it looks like it does nothing
2008-04-24T01:45:00.000Z	Sh4wn		but
2008-04-24T01:45:00.000Z	Sh4wn		Ubuntu does recognise something is connected

2008-04-24T01:47:00.000Z	ikonia	Sh4wn	not drag and drop
2008-04-24T01:48:00.000Z	ikonia	Sh4wn	what file system is on the sony?
2008-04-24T01:49:00.000Z	ikonia	Sh4wn	ok, so you should be able to write to it using sudo
2008-04-24T01:50:00.000Z	Sh4wn	ikonia	ok, ill try it :)
2008-04-24T01:51:00.000Z	Sh4wn	ikonia	yeah thanks :) it works now. But do you have any idea why it does not automatically mount?
2010-10-18T14:38:00.000Z	ikonia	Sh4wn	sites up and working, when you wget it, what does it download
2010-10-18T14:38:00.000Z	Sh4wn	ikonia	when I wget it, it fully works, it's the index.html as it should be
2010-10-18T14:38:00.000Z	ikonia	Sh4wn	have you viewed it ?
2010-10-18T14:40:00.000Z	ikonia	Sh4wn	your firefox isn't set to offline mode is it ?
2010-10-18T14:40:00.000Z	ikonia	Sh4wn	or set to use a proxy
2010-10-18T14:40:00.000Z	Sh4wn	ikonia	nope, other sites work fine
2010-10-18T14:42:00.000Z	ikonia	Sh4wn	that's most odd, and other sites are working fine ?
2010-10-18T14:43:00.000Z	Sh4wn	ikonia	yep, the only site I can't visit is djangoproject.com..
