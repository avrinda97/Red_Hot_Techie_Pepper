2008-04-15T11:18:00.000Z	unop	kdorf	 using the VPN, is there a way you can ping the machine hosting the game?
2008-04-15T11:19:00.000Z	kdorf	unop	Yes, in fact, I can connect for things like SSH through the VPN IP
2008-04-15T11:19:00.000Z	unop	kdorf	you could tunnel with ssh then ..
2008-04-15T11:20:00.000Z	kdorf	unop	Isn't tunneling something you do with outgoing connections? I need this program to accept connections on another adapter
2008-04-15T11:22:00.000Z	unop	kdorf	as long as there is a machine which accpets ssh connection on the same network as the game machine (perhaps the game machine itself) then a tunnel works -- the remote endpoint just needs to be able to make connections to the port on which the game server listens
2008-04-15T11:23:00.000Z	kdorf	unop	Right, but I kind of forgot a detail - my "VPN" is really a VPN so much as a proxy.
2008-04-15T11:24:00.000Z	unop	kdorf	taking out the VPN tunnel from the equation for a moment,  if you were on the the VPN server/proxy in person, could you connect to the game machine ?
2008-04-15T11:25:00.000Z	unop	kdorf	i'm not sure that answers the question .. what i mean is can that machine connect to the port open on the game machine?
2008-04-15T11:28:00.000Z	unop	kdorf	perhaps you should explain this VPN setup? is the layout something like this  [your machine] - > {vpn tunnel} <- [vpn server] -> [game machine] ?
2008-04-15T11:29:00.000Z	unop	kdorf	then the vpn client [your machine] should be able to connect to the [game machine] directly .. as by definition, the vpn client _should_ hold an IP address in the same network/subnet as that of the [game machine]
2008-04-15T11:30:00.000Z	unop	kdorf	i'll wait for you to explain a bit more then :)
2008-04-15T11:32:00.000Z	unop	kdorf	why does the game bind to that specific socket, why doesn't it bind to 0.0.0.0:<whatever> ?
2008-04-15T11:33:00.000Z	kdorf	unop	It's a windows game, and that is how most of them work, unfortunately
2008-04-15T11:36:00.000Z	unop	kdorf	i'm not sure this VPN is implemented correctly - the VPN client should be able to connect to any host in the private subnet the VPN server exist in, firewall or not.
2008-04-15T11:37:00.000Z	kdorf	unop	There are no other machines in my subnet
2008-04-15T11:37:00.000Z	unop	kdorf	so the VPN server and the game run on the same machine?
2008-04-15T11:39:00.000Z	unop	kdorf	does it, i don't see many games using UDP all that much for primary connections
2008-04-15T11:39:00.000Z	kdorf	unop	Yeah, it does use UDP.
2008-04-15T11:39:00.000Z	unop	kdorf	junk that VPN server then and get a real one
2008-04-15T11:40:00.000Z	kdorf	unop	what do you suggest?
2008-04-15T11:41:00.000Z	unop	kdorf	the whole point of a VPN is to get around firewalls .. :)
2008-04-15T11:41:00.000Z	kdorf	unop	Exactly, that's why I have it :)
2008-04-15T11:41:00.000Z	unop	kdorf	err, i don't think you are making use of the VPN to be honest if firewalls are giving you a headache :)
2008-04-15T11:42:00.000Z	kdorf	unop	it's my only option to get around it. Besides that, it's good for anonymity and also keeps my torrents from being throttled :)
