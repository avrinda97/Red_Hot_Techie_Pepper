2012-10-01T08:44:00.000Z	XDEV		It says allocate drive space
2012-10-01T08:44:00.000Z	XDEV		and shows 2 boxes one with 212.3GB and another with 197.2GB
2012-10-01T08:45:00.000Z	XDEV		ok?
2012-10-01T08:47:00.000Z	XDEV		no last time was before and i used the somethign else option
2012-10-01T08:47:00.000Z	XDEV		I since WIPED whole harddrive of both / all operating systems and reinstalled windows and now ubuntu
2012-10-01T08:49:00.000Z	XDEV		i dont understand why its so complicated on my laptop i dualbotted on my desktop and everything worked the first time.
2012-10-01T08:50:00.000Z	KM0201	XDEV	it's not complicated
2012-10-01T08:50:00.000Z	KM0201		the "beside windows" is not going to work.
2012-10-01T08:50:00.000Z	XDEV	KM0201	It is if you tried 4 times
2012-10-01T08:50:00.000Z	KM0201		if his problem is the same as it was before, he has already created the partition under Windows.
2012-10-01T08:52:00.000Z	XDEV		km i am already installing ubuntu via the side by side
2012-10-01T08:52:00.000Z	XDEV		what jordan told me
2012-10-01T08:52:00.000Z	KM0201		ok
2012-10-01T08:52:00.000Z	KM0201		so whats the problem now?
2012-10-01T08:53:00.000Z	XDEV		the problem will be if it doesnt work "what you say will happen"
2012-10-01T08:53:00.000Z	KM0201		my guess is, you're going to have about 200gigs of space not being used.
2012-10-01T08:53:00.000Z	XDEV		ANd that I believe it took space from the Windows partition and not unallocated
2012-10-01T08:53:00.000Z	KM0201	XDEV	BINGO... that's what i've been trying to tell you
2012-10-01T08:53:00.000Z	XDEV		so now i have random unallocated 400GB space and only about 170GB windows
2012-10-01T08:54:00.000Z	KM0201	XDEV	yup... thats what i wsas trying to tell you earlier
