2010-10-21T21:39:00.000Z	Omni_Link		Can anyone help me with a keyboard setting & How to undo keyboard changes?
2010-10-21T21:40:00.000Z	jdu	Omni_Link	setxbkmap <desired keyboard layout>    is useful
2010-10-21T21:41:00.000Z	jdu		any advice as to font rendering of qt3 programs under ubuntu 10.04 with gnome? I believe I need to configure subpixel smoothing without access to corresponding qt3 gui tools
2010-10-21T21:41:00.000Z	Omni_Link	jdu	So would i enter "setxbkmap downarrow" or "default"? (i've only been running Ubuntu for about 3 weeks
2010-10-21T21:41:00.000Z	jdu	Omni_Link	what do you want to do?
2010-10-21T21:42:00.000Z	jdu	Omni_Link	my time to help is unfortunately very limited
2010-10-21T21:42:00.000Z	Omni_Link	jdu	Set my Downarrow back to moving down.
2010-10-21T21:43:00.000Z	jdu		the setxkbmap command is followed by two letter abreviations such as us or de or longer keyboard layout names such as dvorak
2010-10-21T21:43:00.000Z	jdu	Omni_Link	one moment
2010-10-21T21:46:00.000Z	jdu	Omni_Link	research xmodmap which allows you to change the function of keys when you know the key's identification number
2010-10-21T21:46:00.000Z	jdu	Omni_Link	i.e. man xmodmap to look up the manual page
2010-10-21T21:46:00.000Z	jdu	Omni_Link	and the other command to obtain the corresponding key identification number, I'm trying to remember or find what that is
2010-10-21T21:47:00.000Z	Omni_Link	jdu	ok, i will look it up and see what i can change. I tried setxkbmap us and it did not change it. So i'll look at that. :)
2010-10-21T21:47:00.000Z	Omni_Link	jdu	i know the keybord usb code. it is 0x70051
2010-10-21T21:47:00.000Z	Omni_Link	jdu	the Up arrow is 0x70052
2010-10-21T21:48:00.000Z	jdu	Omni_Link	ok good, there are also two digit number representations
2010-10-21T21:48:00.000Z	jdu		I am unsure which you need
2010-10-21T21:48:00.000Z	jdu	Omni_Link	the command: xev
2010-10-21T21:48:00.000Z	Omni_Link	jdu	i dont know the 2 number one. but i'll look around through the manual real quick and see if that helps me.
2010-10-21T21:49:00.000Z	jdu	Omni_Link	run the command, a window appears, hover your mouse over the window, and type the arrow key
2010-10-21T21:49:00.000Z	jdu	Omni_Link	the output in the terminal will indicate information about the key or mouse events
2010-10-21T21:49:00.000Z	jdu		including the corresponding numbers
2010-10-21T21:50:00.000Z	jdu	Omni_Link	ok, must go, best of luck
2010-10-21T21:50:00.000Z	Omni_Link	jdu	thank you very much for yor help
