2006-06-09T13:51:00.000Z	Flannel	Zambezi	like the mail?  it should copy over fine.  same format on each
2006-06-09T13:54:00.000Z	Zambezi	Flannel	I'll import my mails in Outlook to Thunderbird. And when I'll migrate to Ubuntu. But is there any problem to import TB-files from Windows to Linux?
2006-06-09T13:55:00.000Z	Flannel	Zambezi	hansdezwart did just that, apparently, ask him about quirks.  I've never used thunderbird.
2006-06-09T13:56:00.000Z	Zambezi	Flannel	I'll ask him.
2006-07-24T06:36:00.000Z	Flannel	Zambezi	what?

2006-07-24T06:39:00.000Z	Flannel	Zambezi	if you've been PMing me, I haven't gotten them, you need to be registed and identified for queries
2006-07-24T06:41:00.000Z	Zambezi	Flannel	I should be identify.

2006-08-23T06:36:00.000Z	Flannel	Zambezi	where is hdb1 mounted?
2006-08-23T06:36:00.000Z	Zambezi	Flannel	/mnt/hdb1
2006-08-23T06:47:00.000Z	Zambezi	Flannel	Could you help me?
2007-01-31T17:48:00.000Z	Zambezi	Flannel	I don't have X. That's the problem.
2007-01-31T17:49:00.000Z	Flannel	Zambezi	read the rest of the line ;)
2007-01-31T06:01:00.000Z	Zambezi	Flannel	Will cdrecord do it? Is it good and easy to use?
2007-01-31T06:02:00.000Z	Flannel	Zambezi	yes.  I have no idea how good it is though.
2008-02-02T09:25:00.000Z	Flannel	Zambezi	filename is 255 chars, but path total has no real limit.  With FAT32, its either 8.3 or 255, if you have unicode with LFN.
2008-02-02T09:28:00.000Z	Zambezi	Flannel	Maybe I'm going to format my USB-memory to EXT3 later. I have long filenames, but not as long as hundred and no complain so I think it's activated by default.
