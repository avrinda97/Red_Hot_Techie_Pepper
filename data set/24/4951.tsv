2006-12-05T09:44:00.000Z	scrupul0us		howq do i shortcut "/etc/init.d/apache2 restart" so i can type apache2 restart anywhere?
2006-12-05T09:46:00.000Z	scrupul0us		so "ln -s /etc/init.d/apache2 /apache2 ???
2006-12-05T09:46:00.000Z	IcemanV9	scrupul0us	create an alias for apache2 in your .bash_aliases file
2006-12-05T09:46:00.000Z	IcemanV9	scrupul0us	you can put it in your .bashrc if you prefer
2006-12-05T09:47:00.000Z	scrupul0us	IcemanV9	can u walk me through an example or recommend a tutorial?
2006-12-05T09:48:00.000Z	IcemanV9	scrupul0us	hld on
2006-12-05T09:48:00.000Z	scrupul0us	IcemanV9	thank you sir
2006-12-05T09:51:00.000Z	IcemanV9	scrupul0us	sorry. in your .bashrc file, just add alias apache2='/etc/init.d/apache2'
2006-12-05T09:52:00.000Z	IcemanV9	scrupul0us	when you done edit the file, just type source .bashrc. then type apache2 restart
2006-12-05T09:53:00.000Z	scrupul0us	IcemanV9	just at the bottom ok? and do i have to restart anything?
2006-12-05T09:53:00.000Z	IcemanV9	scrupul0us	that is fine. or just after alias lines.
2006-12-05T09:57:00.000Z	IcemanV9	scrupul0us	it doesn't work? here's one of my aliases --> alias orarestart='sudo /etc/init.d/oracle-xe restart'
2006-12-05T09:57:00.000Z	IcemanV9	scrupul0us	that should give you an idea
2006-12-05T09:58:00.000Z	scrupul0us	IcemanV9	i didnt have the alias in the front.. never the less.. new error: root@web:~# apache2 restart
2006-12-05T10:01:00.000Z	IcemanV9	scrupul0us	try this one --> alias aparestart='sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart'
2006-12-05T10:01:00.000Z	scrupul0us	IcemanV9	how can that be right... I know its a file!
2006-12-05T10:03:00.000Z	scrupul0us	IcemanV9	i did this: alias wwwreload='/etc/init.d/apache2 restart' and got: -bash: /etc/init.d/apache2: No such file or directory
2006-12-05T10:03:00.000Z	IcemanV9	scrupul0us	odd.
2006-12-05T10:04:00.000Z	scrupul0us	IcemanV9	indeed... you sure running source .bashrc is all i have to run?
2006-12-05T10:04:00.000Z	IcemanV9	scrupul0us	yep
2006-12-05T10:05:00.000Z	IcemanV9	scrupul0us	 all it does to reread the file and it will do whatever you command
2006-12-05T10:05:00.000Z	IcemanV9	scrupul0us	it does not make a difference. hmm.
2006-12-05T10:07:00.000Z	scrupul0us	IcemanV9	HAHAHA im a dumb bastard... i just reformatted... apache isnt installed yet
2006-12-05T10:08:00.000Z	IcemanV9	scrupul0us	oh jeez. lol
