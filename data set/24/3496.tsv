2009-06-26T16:31:00.000Z	Dave__		what does the 'non-free' bit mean?
2009-06-26T16:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dave__	its proprietary
2009-06-26T16:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dave__	it is free as in money
2009-06-26T16:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dave__	can you do a small screenshot for us to see
2009-06-26T16:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dave__	i use banshee, never seen n orange square

2009-06-26T16:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dave__	make sure the file exists
2009-06-26T16:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dave__	I'd also rescan you collection just to make sure everything is nice

2009-06-26T16:38:00.000Z	Dave__	ActionParsnip	 i just rescanned and its the same
2009-06-26T16:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dave__	theres no #banshee I have no idea what that means
2009-06-26T16:40:00.000Z	Dave__	ActionParsnip	 would it matter that my music is on my other hard drive?
2009-06-26T16:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dave__	try getting the properties of the orange files and the properties of "normal" files and see if there are any differences
2009-06-26T16:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dave__	all ALL the files/
2009-06-26T16:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dave__	very weird
2009-06-26T16:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dave__	maybe you need codecs?
2009-06-26T16:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dave__	I'd log a bug and add your screenshot as an attatchment
2009-06-26T16:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dave__	try playing them in another player
2009-06-26T16:44:00.000Z	Dave__	ActionParsnip	 you might be right, i cant hear any sound
2009-06-26T16:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dave__	sudo apt-get --reinstall install ubuntu-restricted-extras
2009-06-26T16:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dave__	should install nice codecs for you
2009-06-26T16:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dave__	or use te medibuntu repo and install w32codecs or w64codecs depending on architecture
