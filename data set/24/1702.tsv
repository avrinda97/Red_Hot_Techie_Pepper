2009-10-01T23:39:00.000Z	seil		Hello... if am using ubuntu in virtualbox as guest and its very very slow, are there other ubuntu products to use? will it be any better?
2009-10-01T23:39:00.000Z	sebsebseb	seil	hmm Ubuntu in Virtualbox with Windows as host?
2009-10-01T23:39:00.000Z	seil	sebsebseb	yes
2009-10-01T23:40:00.000Z	sebsebseb	seil	oh dear
2009-10-01T23:40:00.000Z	seil	sebsebseb	:(
2009-10-01T23:40:00.000Z	sebsebseb	seil	Windows as the host OS :(  I hope this is only for getting a feel for Ubuntu
2009-10-01T23:40:00.000Z	sebsebseb	seil	how much RAM do you have?
2009-10-01T23:41:00.000Z	seil	sebsebseb	1gb
2009-10-01T23:41:00.000Z	seil	sebsebseb	and am using a netbook ! lol
2009-10-01T23:41:00.000Z	sebsebseb	seil	Maybe that's why it's slow then
2009-10-01T23:42:00.000Z	sebsebseb	seil	would be better probably to put it on for real,  but in that case  may as well wait until 9.10, released on October 29th.  also #vbox can probably help you
2009-10-01T23:42:00.000Z	seil	sebsebseb	why wait for 9.10?
2009-10-01T23:44:00.000Z	sebsebseb	seil	a few reasons
2009-10-01T23:44:00.000Z	seil	sebsebseb	performance reasons?
2009-10-01T23:45:00.000Z	sebsebseb	seil	Ext4  is default in 9.10 :)  it's not in 9.04 it's optional, but not perfectly stable.   plus upgrading takes time,  or doing another re install. and so on
2009-10-01T23:45:00.000Z	seil	sebsebseb	do you think if I use kubuntu, xubuntu, lubuntu it would be better for me?
2009-10-01T23:45:00.000Z	sebsebseb	seil	you can have all of those in an Ubuntu install
2009-10-01T23:46:00.000Z	sebsebseb	seil	well maybe lubuntu isn't in the repo I don't know, I haven't done it
2009-10-01T23:46:00.000Z	seil	sebsebseb	would I get better performance with the other products?
2009-10-01T23:47:00.000Z	sebsebseb	seil	well it's a netbook, so the hardware won't be that great,  if Virtualbox is still bad, after doing a bit more RAM and Video memory, or whatever #vbox suggest.   you could try VMware player or server, and even  Microsoft Virtualpc hmm
2009-10-01T23:48:00.000Z	sebsebseb	seil	I  would avoide Microsoft Virtualpc :)  ,but maybe on that netbook it would be better than the others
2009-10-01T23:49:00.000Z	seil	sebsebseb	bought the laptop 2 weeks ago and it had preinstalled windowsxp didnt want to mess with it as am not pro in linux yet
2009-10-01T23:50:00.000Z	sebsebseb	seil	nostalgicBadger  has a point you can try a Live CD,  but right it's a netbook, so you don't even have a CD drive right?  well  you can do Ubuntu from USB
2009-10-01T23:51:00.000Z	sebsebseb	seil	probably, because it's running in a virtual machine, plus  some of us get issues like that with FIrefox in Ubuntu
