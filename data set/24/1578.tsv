2009-11-11T07:09:00.000Z	genezoz		didnt get any responses before so trying again!
2009-11-11T07:09:00.000Z	genezoz		im having the black screen at boot with 9.10. Im using ati x800
2009-11-11T07:09:00.000Z	genezoz		ive tried literally everything
2009-11-11T07:10:00.000Z	Halitech	genezoz	did you try installing any drivers from the ati website?
2009-11-11T07:11:00.000Z	genezoz	Halitech	I haven't. I read that the ATI drivers were worthless. And their recent catalyst pack doesnt support x800.
2009-11-11T07:11:00.000Z	Halitech	genezoz	ok, just wanted to make sure you hadn't
2009-11-11T07:12:00.000Z	Halitech	genezoz	not that I agree the ati drivers are worthless, I'm using them with my hd4350 and they work fine for me
2009-11-11T07:13:00.000Z	Halitech	genezoz	can you boot into safe mode from the live cd?
2009-11-11T07:14:00.000Z	genezoz	Halitech	Im using the Live CD now.
2009-11-11T07:14:00.000Z	Halitech	genezoz	ok and its working fine there?
2009-11-11T07:14:00.000Z	genezoz	Halitech	Flash is garbage, but otherwise yes.
2009-11-11T07:15:00.000Z	Halitech	genezoz	so you install and reboot and thats when you get the black screen? is it showing any drivers in use in Hardware drivers?
2009-11-11T07:16:00.000Z	genezoz	Halitech	No drivers in use. Once I install (doesnt matter if its an update or a clean install) It boots up for the first time and black screen. Can't alt-f3/7 either.
2009-11-11T07:17:00.000Z	Halitech	genezoz	strange ...
2009-11-11T07:17:00.000Z	genezoz	Halitech	Well...I can't confirm no drivers are in use. How would I check that? I can't get a command prompt unless im in netroot.
2009-11-11T07:17:00.000Z	Halitech	genezoz	I was wondering about in the live session
2009-11-11T07:17:00.000Z	genezoz	Halitech	Checking
2009-11-11T07:18:00.000Z	genezoz	Halitech	No proprietary drivers are in use
2009-11-11T07:18:00.000Z	Halitech	genezoz	ok so shouldn't be loading anything at boot either
2009-11-11T07:19:00.000Z	genezoz	Halitech	-13-generic works. -14-generic does not Is there a way to install 9.10 and roll back the kernel?
2009-11-11T07:20:00.000Z	Halitech	genezoz	I would hazard a guess that you can but I'm not sure how
2009-11-11T07:21:00.000Z	genezoz	Halitech	I haven't been able to find that...I tried apt-cache search kernel-image in netroot, but it doesnt pull anything up. I assume because Im already using -14-generic
2009-11-11T07:22:00.000Z	Halitech	genezoz	could be, I'm not a kernel expert so not sure
2009-11-11T07:23:00.000Z	genezoz	Halitech	Thanks anyway. =)
