2005-09-05T11:48:00.000Z	glyn		Dr_Willis>I'm not sure, I just clicked on a link and opened it with wine
2005-09-05T11:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	glyn	 a link?
2005-09-05T11:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	glyn	 i just used the apt-get stuff and dident have to download it seperatly.
2005-09-05T11:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	glyn	 check your wine configs
2005-09-05T11:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	glyn	 aparently  - if its not there. :P
2005-09-05T11:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	glyn	 whats nto working?
2005-09-05T11:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	glyn	 yoy ran wine as a user?
2005-09-05T11:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	glyn	 you mean you clicked on the .exe and it ran with wine?
2005-09-05T11:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	glyn	 how vague.. :P did it RUN?
2005-09-05T11:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	glyn	 perhaps  are just not finding the right C drive. :P i recall mine was defaulted to .wine/fake_windows/   does it even Seem like its installing right?
2005-09-05T11:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	glyn	 under cygwin - i see that mine defaulted to  \home\willis\.transgaming\c_drive
2005-09-05T11:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	glyn	 sounds to me like the installer may be a little brain dead/wine issues.
2005-09-05T12:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	glyn	 try installing somthing else  and see what happens.
2005-09-05T12:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	glyn	 you havent tryed the "ls -R" thing yet have ya ? :P
2005-09-05T12:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	glyn	 well for the 4th time... use "ls -R" from yoru home dir to see a recursive file listing. :P
2005-09-05T12:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	glyn	 if you installed say.. irfanview. to  the irfanview dir. ya could 'ls -R | grep irfanview'
2005-09-05T12:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	glyn	 right click, save link as... perhaps.
2005-09-21T10:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	glyn	 nope,. :P check the wiki and docs/homepage first?
