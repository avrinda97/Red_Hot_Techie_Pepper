2007-09-24T12:08:00.000Z	strike		hi, how do I add external USB mouse on feisty? I am on lenovo R60
2007-09-24T12:09:00.000Z	strike		I can see it being detected in dmesg
2007-09-24T12:09:00.000Z	strike		its is not working
2007-09-24T12:11:00.000Z	Jowi	strike	usb mice and keyboards are supposed to "Just Work (tm)". plug in - that's it. if it does not work try a different usb port
2007-09-24T12:12:00.000Z	strike	Jowi	it isn't working on a different USB port as well
2007-09-24T12:13:00.000Z	Jowi	strike	is the mouse working on another computer (or with the Ubuntu live CD?)
2007-09-24T12:13:00.000Z	strike	Jowi	yes.. it works on other computers
2007-09-24T12:14:00.000Z	strike	Jowi	here is my dmesg output http://pastebin.ca/708886
2007-09-24T12:16:00.000Z	Jowi	strike	are the disconnect message from when you have remove the mouse or did it disconnect by itself?
2007-09-24T12:17:00.000Z	strike	Jowi	nope, I did, I changed the USB port
2007-09-24T12:19:00.000Z	Jowi	strike	can you pastebin your /etc/X11/xorg.conf?
2007-09-24T12:23:00.000Z	strike	Jowi	here is my xorg.conf file http://pastebin.ca/708896
2007-09-24T12:23:00.000Z	strike	Jowi	ok.. got it.. I need to add another section there it seems
2007-09-24T12:23:00.000Z	strike	Jowi	for external mouse
2007-09-24T12:25:00.000Z	Jowi	strike	I just double checked the config and, no, you shouldn't have to. your mouse points to /dev/input/mice which all plugged in mice should use. if it would have pointed to a serial device then, yes you would have had to add a new section.... I have no idea what's going on. have you tried to boot the computer with the mouse plugged in?
2007-09-24T12:25:00.000Z	strike	Jowi	no, I did not try booting it with mouse plugged in
2007-09-24T12:26:00.000Z	strike	Jowi	going to reboot with mouse plugged in
2007-09-24T12:26:00.000Z	Jowi	strike	unless there is some touchpad setting for laptops I'm not aware of, several mices should be able to be plugged in at the same time...
2007-09-24T12:27:00.000Z	strike	Jowi	yes, same thing is working on my other lappy
2007-09-24T12:27:00.000Z	Jowi	strike	also an Ubuntu system?
2007-09-24T12:27:00.000Z	strike	Jowi	nope, its a debian system
2007-09-24T12:27:00.000Z	Jowi	strike	good enough ;)
2007-09-24T12:28:00.000Z	strike	Jowi	see you in some more time.. rebooting
2007-09-24T12:28:00.000Z	Jowi	strike	does it also use a synaptics touchpad or is it a stationary PC?
