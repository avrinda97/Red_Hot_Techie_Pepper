2006-04-12T15:37:00.000Z	biovore		I run a raid using mdadm on ubuntu
2006-04-12T15:37:00.000Z	biovore		!ubotu java
2006-04-12T15:37:00.000Z	obscurite	biovore	- i used the installer to set up a raid1, but it wouldn't let me add a swap for some reason, so i have a giant / partition on my raid1 device
2006-04-12T15:38:00.000Z	obscurite	biovore	- i am wondering if i need to go back to the drawing board, or if I can somehow make a swap partitoin happen
2006-04-12T15:38:00.000Z	biovore		the raid can only be 1 partion I belive
2006-04-12T15:38:00.000Z	obscurite	biovore	- what about swap? how did you handle that?
2006-04-12T15:39:00.000Z	obscurite	biovore	- should i have one raid1 for / and another for /tmp ?
2006-04-12T15:39:00.000Z	biovore		if your raiding 2 HD's I made each drive have 2 partions with each drive having 256MB swap partion and the rest as a partions to put into a raid
2006-04-12T15:40:00.000Z	obscurite	biovore	- so if you lost a drive, your swap would get blown away?
2006-04-12T15:40:00.000Z	biovore		yup.. raid 1
2006-04-12T15:40:00.000Z	obscurite	biovore	- that would crash some applications thus defeating raid1?
2006-04-12T15:40:00.000Z	obscurite	biovore	- some applications depend on /tmp being stable
2006-04-12T15:41:00.000Z	biovore		raid 1 is mirror
2006-04-12T15:41:00.000Z	biovore		right
2006-04-12T15:42:00.000Z	biovore	obscurite	let me look how I have it setup on my box
2006-04-12T15:42:00.000Z	obscurite	biovore	- thanks!
2006-04-12T15:43:00.000Z	biovore		yeah.. I have what I said..  I have my swap on a sperate disk
2006-04-12T15:44:00.000Z	biovore		You might able to partition the /dev/md device..
2006-04-12T15:44:00.000Z	obscurite	biovore	- that would save your data if a drive failed, but anything depending on /tmp would fail or act weird
2006-04-12T15:44:00.000Z	obscurite	biovore	- right?
2006-04-12T15:44:00.000Z	biovore		yeah..  its software raid..
2006-04-12T15:44:00.000Z	biovore		want complete uptime. get a hardware raid card
2006-04-12T15:44:00.000Z	obscurite	biovore	- Gotcha :)
2006-04-12T15:46:00.000Z	obscurite	biovore	- thanks a lot for your advice.
