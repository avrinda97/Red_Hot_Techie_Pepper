2006-11-21T14:44:00.000Z	mikeo1f		i did gksu "update-manager -c"  and it downloads the upgrade tool but nothing happens... how do i upgrade?
2006-11-21T14:45:00.000Z	gnomefreak	mikeo1f	click check
2006-11-21T14:45:00.000Z	gnomefreak	mikeo1f	it should than after checking for updates show a button on top that says there is a distro upgrade
2006-11-21T14:46:00.000Z	gnomefreak	mikeo1f	make sure you are up to date first sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade  than try the tool again
2006-11-21T14:47:00.000Z	gnomefreak	mikeo1f	what version are you on now?
2006-11-21T14:47:00.000Z	gnomefreak	mikeo1f	that might be why
2006-11-21T14:47:00.000Z	gnomefreak	mikeo1f	try what i said
2006-11-21T14:49:00.000Z	gnomefreak	mikeo1f	ok gksudo "update-manager -c"
2006-11-21T14:49:00.000Z	gnomefreak	mikeo1f	let me know what happens
2006-11-21T14:50:00.000Z	mikeo1f	gnomefreak	asks to check for updates manually
2006-11-21T14:50:00.000Z	gnomefreak	mikeo1f	click check
2006-11-21T14:51:00.000Z	gnomefreak	mikeo1f	click that
2006-11-21T14:51:00.000Z	gnomefreak	mikeo1f	ok
2006-11-21T14:51:00.000Z	gnomefreak	mikeo1f	it just closed?
2006-11-21T14:52:00.000Z	gnomefreak	mikeo1f	ok you may have to do it manully than. i have to ask mvo about that
2006-11-21T14:53:00.000Z	gnomefreak	mikeo1f	hes not online atm i will get in touch with him and find out why server kernels are doing that. its been on my agenda for weeks and havent gotten to it
2006-11-21T14:54:00.000Z	gnomefreak	mikeo1f	yes
2006-11-21T14:55:00.000Z	gnomefreak	mikeo1f	you need it to do the upgrade properly (it may fial if not installed)
2006-11-21T14:56:00.000Z	gnomefreak	mikeo1f	than do it without it but its a good chance it will fail and leave you unstable system
2006-11-21T14:57:00.000Z	gnomefreak	mikeo1f	that was for you
2006-11-21T14:57:00.000Z	gnomefreak	mikeo1f	with the set up you have you might be safer installing from cd
2006-11-21T14:58:00.000Z	mikeo1f	gnomefreak	this is a production server
2006-11-21T14:58:00.000Z	gnomefreak	mikeo1f	than dapper is the safest bet
2006-11-21T14:58:00.000Z	gnomefreak	mikeo1f	dapper is lTS
