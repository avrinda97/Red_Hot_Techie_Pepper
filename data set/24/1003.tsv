2011-02-05T17:55:00.000Z	sacarlson	anygivenname	is this just for a browser like firefox?  they have cool plugins to change proxy and there a web sites that list free proxy services
2011-02-05T17:56:00.000Z	anygivenname	sacarlson	I have installed Privoxy on Ubuntu & it should do the same as the free proxy services if configured....I just dont know how to configure it
2011-02-05T17:57:00.000Z	sacarlson	anygivenname	oh do you want to become the proxy server side?
2011-02-05T17:57:00.000Z	anygivenname	sacarlson	yes
2011-02-05T18:00:00.000Z	anygivenname	sacarlson	can you help ?
2011-02-05T18:01:00.000Z	sacarlson	anygivenname	no I don't have time sorry,  it doesn't look hard and it's well documented http://www.privoxy.org/user-manual/index.html
2011-02-05T18:02:00.000Z	anygivenname	sacarlson	already looked that shitty manual....it doesnt help
2011-02-05T18:03:00.000Z	sacarlson	anygivenname	did you even view the current configuration files
2011-02-05T18:04:00.000Z	anygivenname	sacarlson	yes & changed it as per the manual
2011-02-05T18:05:00.000Z	sacarlson	anygivenname	did you configure your router to redirect the port used to your server running the listiner port
2011-02-05T18:05:00.000Z	anygivenname	sacarlson	the manual does not state what settings need to be on the client connecting remotely....so I used the IP address given by the ISP
2011-02-05T18:05:00.000Z	anygivenname	sacarlson	yes done that
2011-02-05T18:06:00.000Z	sacarlson	anygivenname	your ip provided on wan will probly change you do know that don't you unless you have static ip from you service
2011-02-05T18:06:00.000Z	anygivenname	sacarlson	I have static IP
2011-02-05T18:07:00.000Z	sacarlson	anygivenname	ok what's your ip
2011-02-05T18:07:00.000Z	sacarlson	anygivenname	feel free to pm it to me if privacy needed
2011-02-05T18:07:00.000Z	sacarlson	anygivenname	do you have wireshark installed?
2011-02-05T18:08:00.000Z	anygivenname	sacarlson	no....what's wireshark ?
2011-02-05T18:08:00.000Z	sacarlson	anygivenname	it's a networking tool
2011-02-05T18:08:00.000Z	sacarlson	anygivenname	see if you see the trafic from your client come in
2011-02-05T18:09:00.000Z	sacarlson	anygivenname	check sudo iptables -L to verify you have all ports open
2011-02-05T18:09:00.000Z	anygivenname	sacarlson	I have ping & it is coming great
2011-02-05T18:10:00.000Z	sacarlson	anygivenname	ok try your clients browser on the port you use and see with wireshark if that's also visable or whatever port you use
2011-02-05T18:11:00.000Z	sacarlson	anygivenname	ok got to go,  good luck
