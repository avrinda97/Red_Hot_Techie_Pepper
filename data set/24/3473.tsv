2010-10-13T09:50:00.000Z	kevin_		does anyone have the link of .debs for the different wine packages? I can't find it
2010-10-13T09:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kevin_	add the wine ppa
2010-10-13T09:51:00.000Z	kevin_	ActionParsnip	I did that as well
2010-10-13T09:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kevin_	then if you run: sudo apt-get update; apt-cache search wine   you should see it
2010-10-13T09:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kevin_	yep you need to tell the package system to refresh the lists ;)
2010-10-13T09:53:00.000Z	kevin_	ActionParsnip	learn something new everyday ;)
2010-10-13T09:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kevin_	every day is a school day
2010-10-13T09:54:00.000Z	kevin_	ActionParsnip	yup
2010-10-22T02:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kevin_	add this to /etc/hosts       88.191.101.8 packages.medibuntu.org
2010-10-22T02:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kevin_	then try again
2010-10-22T02:05:00.000Z	kevin_	ActionParsnip	still getting the same problem after adding that
2010-10-22T02:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kevin_	so if you run: dig packages.medibuntu.org    does it resolve to 88.191.101.8 ?
2010-10-22T02:08:00.000Z	kevin_	ActionParsnip	no, 88.191.127.22
2010-10-22T02:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kevin_	thats why, its the wrong IP. are you sure you added the line in /etc/hosts   and did you save the file ok?
2010-10-22T02:09:00.000Z	kevin_	ActionParsnip	I do have it, http://pastebin.com/BThF42RP
2010-10-22T02:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kevin_	looks ok according to many sites
2010-10-22T02:13:00.000Z	kevin_	ActionParsnip	and when I run the commands to get medibuntu, it tries to connect to this: 87.98.242.110
2010-10-22T02:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kevin_	in the command you could change the name for the IP...
2010-10-22T02:15:00.000Z	kevin_	ActionParsnip	when I do that it times out. T_T
2010-10-22T02:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kevin_	you may need to restart networking
2010-10-22T02:16:00.000Z	kevin_	ActionParsnip	will a reboot restart networking?
2011-08-30T09:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kevin_	emerald is 3 years dead
2011-08-30T09:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kevin_	openbox
2011-08-30T09:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kevin_	apply what theme?
