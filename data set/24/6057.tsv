2006-02-24T11:52:00.000Z	concept10	redblade	Sunbird calendar?'
2006-02-24T11:53:00.000Z	concept10	redblade	you can get an calendar extension to thunderbird
2006-02-24T11:54:00.000Z	redblade	concept10	how?
2006-02-24T11:54:00.000Z	concept10	redblade	goto the mozilla extension site for thunderbird
2006-02-26T16:06:00.000Z	concept10	redblade	run a older version of apache
2006-02-26T16:06:00.000Z	concept10	redblade	such as the 1.3.x branch or the 2.0.blah brach
2006-02-26T16:07:00.000Z	concept10	redblade	you never want to run bleeding edge on the webserver
2006-02-26T16:08:00.000Z	redblade	concept10	what do you mean?
2006-02-26T16:09:00.000Z	concept10	redblade	I mean this:  Run a older version of apache instead of the newer versions, when you run a webserver you want to run well tested solutions
2006-02-26T16:17:00.000Z	redblade	concept10	I really would like to try running this version and just fix the problem.
2006-02-26T16:18:00.000Z	concept10	redblade	i cant help on 2.2, havent used it before, are you using breezy or dapper?
2006-03-04T12:31:00.000Z	concept10	redblade	^^
2006-03-04T12:31:00.000Z	concept10	redblade	its a permissions problem
2006-03-04T12:32:00.000Z	concept10	redblade	do this: sudo chmod -R 775 /var/run/mysqld/
2006-03-04T12:32:00.000Z	concept10	redblade	and then /etc/init.d/mysql restart
2006-03-04T12:34:00.000Z	concept10	redblade	did it work?
2006-03-04T12:34:00.000Z	redblade	concept10	no
2006-03-04T12:34:00.000Z	concept10	redblade	it wouldnt restart?
2006-03-04T12:39:00.000Z	concept10	redblade	what else did you do?
2006-03-04T12:39:00.000Z	redblade	concept10	nothing why?
2006-03-04T12:40:00.000Z	concept10	redblade	that should've worked for you. If you goto #mysql they will tell you its a permissions problem to.  What message did you get??
2006-03-04T12:41:00.000Z	concept10	redblade	are you on dapper?
2006-03-04T12:42:00.000Z	redblade	concept10	breezy
