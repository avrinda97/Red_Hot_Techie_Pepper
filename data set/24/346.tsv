2012-11-28T09:56:00.000Z	heoyea	selite	use functions instead of alias
2012-11-28T09:57:00.000Z	selite	heoyea	What functions?
2012-11-28T09:57:00.000Z	heoyea	selite	is more powerful then alias
2012-11-28T09:57:00.000Z	selite	heoyea	Do you have any idea how to implement it?
2012-11-28T09:58:00.000Z	heoyea	selite	example, nameiwant() {echo hello ;}
2012-11-28T09:58:00.000Z	selite	heoyea	I hope you aren't misunderstanding the question, I don't want to write C code to do this, I just want some kind of a tweak so that 'rn fileName' will compile and run fileName.
2012-11-28T09:59:00.000Z	selite	heoyea	I type that in terminal, it fails.
2012-11-28T09:59:00.000Z	heoyea	selite	add it to ur bashrc
2012-11-28T10:00:00.000Z	selite	heoyea	How do I do that, I mean I don't know where bashrc.txt is located.
2012-11-28T10:00:00.000Z	heoyea	selite	in ur home folder, hit ctrl+h
2012-11-28T10:00:00.000Z	heoyea	selite	if u dont got it create one
2012-11-28T10:02:00.000Z	selite	heoyea	I did 'gedit .bashrc' and I added 'nameiwant() { echo hello; }' and it didn't work.
2012-11-28T10:02:00.000Z	heoyea	selite	is just an example, u put what ever code u want
2012-11-28T10:04:00.000Z	selite	heoyea	Doesn't work, command not found.
2012-11-28T10:04:00.000Z	heoyea	selite	u gotta reload it everytime u edit the bashrc file
2012-11-28T10:05:00.000Z	heoyea	selite	just run bash again
2012-11-28T10:06:00.000Z	selite	heoyea	I did. I get "syntax error near unexpected token"
2012-11-28T10:08:00.000Z	heoyea	selite	then u did something wrong
2012-11-28T10:08:00.000Z	selite	heoyea	Nothing is wrong except the code that you provided. Considering there is a syntax error.
2012-11-28T10:16:00.000Z	heoyea	selite	Jordan_U not sure wat u guys on about by mine was correct =D
2012-11-28T10:19:00.000Z	heoyea	selite	u can do like name() { javac "$1" ;}
2012-11-28T10:19:00.000Z	selite	heoyea	Yup did it.
2012-11-28T10:19:00.000Z	selite	heoyea	Thanks a lot.
2012-11-28T10:19:00.000Z	heoyea	selite	use $@ for multiple arguments
