2007-02-13T06:12:00.000Z	hitmanWilly	Wimpog	you could use the linux drive as default and use GRUB to boot win
2007-02-13T06:13:00.000Z	Wimpog	hitmanWilly	that's what I want to do, but the question is is it 'legal' to do that?
2007-02-13T06:13:00.000Z	hitmanWilly	Wimpog	why not?
2007-02-13T06:14:00.000Z	hitmanWilly	Wimpog	win's license talks about virtualization, not actual installs
2007-02-13T06:17:00.000Z	Wimpog	hitmanWilly	hitmanWilly said I can do that
2007-02-13T06:24:00.000Z	hitmanWilly	Wimpog	nice, huh?
2007-02-13T06:24:00.000Z	Wimpog	hitmanWilly	yes. Sorry Guys for some stupid questions, I am not an expert...
2007-02-13T06:24:00.000Z	hitmanWilly	Wimpog	experience from my own dual boot days
2007-02-13T06:24:00.000Z	Wimpog	hitmanWilly	Wicked cool.
2007-02-13T06:49:00.000Z	hitmanWilly	Wimpog	something else must be calling itself hda
2007-02-13T06:49:00.000Z	Wimpog	hitmanWilly	what might it be? fdisk -l doesnot even show hda
2007-02-13T06:49:00.000Z	hitmanWilly	Wimpog	ive seen that from cd drives before
2007-02-13T06:50:00.000Z	Wimpog	hitmanWilly	so cd-rom can be hda???
2007-02-13T06:50:00.000Z	hitmanWilly	Wimpog	hda,b etc are ide hard drives, which is what most cd drives act like
2007-02-13T06:51:00.000Z	Wimpog	hitmanWilly	ok... I see
2007-02-13T06:51:00.000Z	hitmanWilly	Wimpog	if you really want to know, try mounting it
2007-02-13T06:51:00.000Z	Wimpog	hitmanWilly	 mount hda?
2007-02-13T06:52:00.000Z	hitmanWilly	Wimpog	probably your cd is configed as primary ide
2007-02-13T06:52:00.000Z	hitmanWilly	Wimpog	just a guess
2007-02-13T06:52:00.000Z	Wimpog	hitmanWilly	YES, you're right. CD-ROM is Master on one of the IDEs
2007-02-13T06:53:00.000Z	hitmanWilly	Wimpog	if its that big a deal, u could reconfig that with the jumpers on the drives
2007-02-13T06:54:00.000Z	Wimpog	hitmanWilly	not, it is not a big deal, I was just curious, why I could not see hda as one my HDDs. Actually I tried to reconfig the jumpers, but my cd-rom did not like being a slave, and did not work, so I had to make it master again
2007-02-13T06:55:00.000Z	hitmanWilly	Wimpog	probably the way the cables are hooked up
