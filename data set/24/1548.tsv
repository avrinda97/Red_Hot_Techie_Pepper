2010-01-31T23:27:00.000Z	theadmin		Hello. How can I rip audio-cd's?
2010-01-31T23:28:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	theadmin	like rip the music to a format? Or make a copy of the disc as a whole?
2010-01-31T23:28:00.000Z	theadmin	SpaceGhostC2C	Like, convert music it has to MP3
2010-01-31T23:29:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	theadmin	do you want a command line answer? or gui?
2010-01-31T23:29:00.000Z	theadmin	SpaceGhostC2C	actually not important
2010-01-31T23:29:00.000Z	theadmin	SpaceGhostC2C	Just nothing KDEish please
2010-01-31T23:29:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	theadmin	okay you can use rhythmbox if you want.
2010-01-31T23:30:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	theadmin	Oh, we're of the same opinion on that, friend :)
2010-01-31T23:30:00.000Z	theadmin	SpaceGhostC2C	RhythmBox... ugh %) Shouldn't have removed it
2010-01-31T23:30:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	theadmin	what do you use now?
2010-01-31T23:31:00.000Z	theadmin	SpaceGhostC2C	VLC media player
2010-01-31T23:32:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	theadmin	http://www.webforth.com/2007/05/ripping-audio-cds-to-mp3-with-vlc that might help. Also VLC is great with movies and such, but I prefer a real audio player for local and easy things.
2010-01-31T23:32:00.000Z	theadmin	SpaceGhostC2C	It plays EVERYTHINGz. What else do I need from a media player? A CLI? It has that too %) So it satisfies me
2010-01-31T23:33:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	theadmin	To each his own, but there are a few shortcomings of vlc. Maybe you'll find them, maybe you won't.
2010-01-31T23:33:00.000Z	theadmin	SpaceGhostC2C	Shortcomings?
2010-01-31T23:34:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	theadmin	features present in other software, that are lacking in vlc

2010-03-13T12:54:00.000Z	theadmin	SpaceGhostC2C	Sometimes it's better to use info then man, for akward reasons
2010-03-13T12:55:00.000Z	theadmin	SpaceGhostC2C	Who doesn't seem to like the traffic? o_O
2010-03-13T12:56:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	theadmin	doesn't matter.
