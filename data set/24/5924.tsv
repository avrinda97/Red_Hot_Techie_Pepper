2007-12-27T08:22:00.000Z	jimmygoon	tanath	sorry, I looked and I've never seen it do that :/
2007-12-27T08:22:00.000Z	tanath	jimmygoon	:( i can't get it working anymore
2007-12-27T08:23:00.000Z	jimmygoon	tanath	did something in particular, that you noticed, trigger it to not work anymore?
2007-12-27T08:23:00.000Z	tanath	jimmygoon	prolly upgrading to gutsy
2007-12-27T08:23:00.000Z	tanath	jimmygoon	been a while since i've used it, but i think that's what did it
2007-12-27T08:23:00.000Z	jimmygoon	tanath	oh, yeah...
2007-12-27T08:24:00.000Z	tanath	jimmygoon	i tried reinstalling java & python. no go
2007-12-27T08:24:00.000Z	jimmygoon	tanath	I still don't know what to tell you outside of purging python and miro off your system and reinstalling both ...
2007-12-27T08:24:00.000Z	jimmygoon	tanath	heh, oh
2007-12-27T08:24:00.000Z	tanath	jimmygoon	didn't purge miro though...
2007-12-27T08:24:00.000Z	jimmygoon	tanath	well, you shouldn't realy have to
2007-12-27T08:24:00.000Z	jimmygoon	tanath	but, I would update your repos and see if there is one for gutsy (if you didn't already)
2007-12-27T08:24:00.000Z	tanath	jimmygoon	shouldn't be crashing either :P
2007-12-27T08:25:00.000Z	jimmygoon	tanath	just in case there is a difference between the feisty and the gutsy versions...
2007-12-27T08:25:00.000Z	tanath	jimmygoon	er, it's from the gutsy repo
2007-12-27T08:25:00.000Z	jimmygoon	tanath	or not... ha
2007-12-27T08:25:00.000Z	tanath	jimmygoon	it was installed originally as democracyplayer :P
2007-12-27T08:25:00.000Z	jimmygoon	tanath	hm, I dunna then...
2007-12-27T08:26:00.000Z	jimmygoon	tanath	see, I've had that installed before, but I manage to reinstall every 3-5 months due to hard drive failure, dropping my laptop, or a new version of ubuntu coming out... :P
2007-12-27T08:26:00.000Z	tanath	jimmygoon	yeh, i don't reinstall, i upgrade
2007-12-27T08:28:00.000Z	jimmygoon	tanath	yeah, thats what I was saying :)
2007-12-27T08:30:00.000Z	jimmygoon	tanath	I'm gonna get going, so hopefully you are on the right track or someone else can help you...
