2005-12-10T06:58:00.000Z	djk_		What's the syntax to change something ubotu knows?
2005-12-10T07:00:00.000Z	_jason	djk_	use: no compile is blah blah blah
2005-12-10T07:01:00.000Z	djk_	_jason	ah, good to know.
2005-12-16T09:25:00.000Z	djk_	_jason	arigato does afaik, not sure what the other word means..
2005-12-16T09:26:00.000Z	djk_	_jason	yea it does..
2005-12-16T09:27:00.000Z	_jason	djk_	ah ok thanks.  I've heard the arigato but never the second word
2005-12-16T09:27:00.000Z	djk_	_jason	i just checked some japanese-english translation site :)
2005-12-17T09:14:00.000Z	_jason	djk_	probably in #ruby
2005-12-17T09:14:00.000Z	_jason	djk_	never mind i lied, #ruby-lang
2005-12-17T09:15:00.000Z	djk_	_jason	well, i was in #ruby-lang where apparently my algo is broken, neglecting that the provided solution _is_ my algo..
2005-12-17T09:15:00.000Z	_jason	djk_	oh :o
2005-12-17T09:16:00.000Z	djk_	_jason	yea, that was a nice introduction to that channel allright..
2005-12-22T13:29:00.000Z	_jason	djk_	use rename
2005-12-22T13:29:00.000Z	djk_	_jason	i don't really understand the syntax of rename :-/
2005-12-22T13:30:00.000Z	_jason	djk_	you could probably use a for loop too
2005-12-22T13:30:00.000Z	djk_	_jason	how would that look like?
2005-12-22T13:31:00.000Z	_jason	djk_	example: for i in *; do echo $i; done
2005-12-22T13:36:00.000Z	djk_	_jason	didn't work, probably because i failed.
2005-12-22T13:37:00.000Z	_jason	djk_	did you see how the for loop worked with echo?
2005-12-22T13:37:00.000Z	djk_	_jason	yea.
2005-12-22T13:37:00.000Z	_jason	djk_	so what did you try?
2005-12-22T13:39:00.000Z	djk_	_jason	i don't save history in the konsole :-/
2005-12-22T13:40:00.000Z	_jason	djk_	it should work, you probably just have syntax wrong somewhere... you're trying to rename several files right?  just take the time to read the man to rename and read man perlrequick too
2005-12-22T13:40:00.000Z	djk_	_jason	yea
