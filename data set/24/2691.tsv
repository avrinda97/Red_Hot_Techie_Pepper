2009-11-06T13:14:00.000Z	Hasanibrahim	goose	when i try to my sda1 from 108 GiB to 90 GiB, it says check fsdk.
2009-11-06T13:15:00.000Z	goose	Hasanibrahim	have you tried running fdisk while /dev/sda1/ is unmounted?
2009-11-06T13:16:00.000Z	Hasanibrahim	goose	i opened with live USB now and trying to use gparted as fdisk operation
2009-11-06T13:17:00.000Z	goose	Hasanibrahim	sudo umount /dev/sda1/ && sudo fsck /dev/sda1/
2009-11-06T13:17:00.000Z	Hasanibrahim	goose	i did but i gonna do it again wait please
2009-11-06T13:19:00.000Z	goose	Hasanibrahim	df -h, do you see your HDD?
2009-11-06T13:20:00.000Z	goose	Hasanibrahim	unplug your USB HDD, plug it back in, once it mounts, 'df -h' and find your /dev/sdblah/ of your HDD
2009-11-06T13:22:00.000Z	goose	Hasanibrahim	sudo umount /dev/sda1 && sudo fsck /dev/sda1
2009-11-06T13:22:00.000Z	goose	Hasanibrahim	icarus-c was right, I made a mistake adding the extra / at the end
2009-11-06T13:24:00.000Z	goose	Hasanibrahim	ok, unplug your USB and plug it back in again, do "df -h", pastebin the output to me?
2009-11-06T13:25:00.000Z	Hasanibrahim	goose	i opened from live USB and will i unplug USB while it was working with it ? ifi understand true, i gonna unplug now
2009-11-06T13:25:00.000Z	goose	Hasanibrahim	I'm unsure of what "live USB" is, but you shouldn't need it to modify partitions, just gparted will do it
2009-11-06T13:26:00.000Z	Hasanibrahim	goose	i am using a flash disc as live CD
2009-11-06T13:26:00.000Z	goose	Hasanibrahim	are you trying to do this to your internal HD, or an external HD?
2009-11-06T13:27:00.000Z	goose	Hasanibrahim	ah, ok. don't unplug anything.
2009-11-06T13:27:00.000Z	Hasanibrahim	goose	so what to do :(
2009-11-06T13:27:00.000Z	goose	Hasanibrahim	you'll need to make the changes from the live CD, but you'll need to do an fsck before you can, one moment, I'll find the command you need
2009-11-06T13:29:00.000Z	goose	Hasanibrahim	"sudo shutdown -rF now" -r stands for "reboot", "F" stands for "fsck on startup"
2009-11-06T13:30:00.000Z	Hasanibrahim	goose	There are a lot of errors
2009-11-06T13:31:00.000Z	goose	Hasanibrahim	let fsck fix them :>
2009-11-06T13:31:00.000Z	Hasanibrahim	goose	my PC is not doing anything :/
