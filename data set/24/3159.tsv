2008-04-30T06:58:00.000Z	DefineKThyne		Firefox won't play videos, either with Totem or VLC plugins, any ideas?
2008-04-30T06:59:00.000Z	bazhang	DefineKThyne	firefox? is this flash?
2008-04-30T07:00:00.000Z	DefineKThyne	bazhang	not entirely sure, maybe WMV, but it was playing with Totem last night.
2008-04-30T07:00:00.000Z	bazhang	DefineKThyne	well kind of important to know-->what site let me check
2008-04-30T07:01:00.000Z	DefineKThyne	bazhang	give me a min
2008-04-30T07:07:00.000Z	DefineKThyne	bazhang	yeah, wmv. it's not flash. i've got both Totem and VLC plugins for firefox and i just get a plain black screen with (no video) on it.
2008-04-30T07:07:00.000Z	bazhang	DefineKThyne	what is the link let me check
2008-04-30T07:10:00.000Z	DefineKThyne	bazhang	http://s2.bgweiz.at/sebastian.rode/Neuer%20Ordner/Sound/Enter%20The%20Matrix.wmv
2008-04-30T07:12:00.000Z	bazhang	DefineKThyne	that is a drm'd wmv--some MS products likely could not play it
2008-04-30T07:13:00.000Z	DefineKThyne	bazhang	i was still playing wmvs last night though, the only thing i did that might've messed it up was uninstall the totem plugin and reinstall it.
2008-04-30T07:14:00.000Z	bazhang	DefineKThyne	aye, some wmv's will play-->that link gave no file at this url error
2008-04-30T07:14:00.000Z	DefineKThyne	bazhang	 alrighty then, i'll look around at some other stuff and see what i can dig up, you look like you've got your hands full here. thanks anyway
2008-05-03T06:54:00.000Z	bazhang	DefineKThyne	maybe
2008-05-03T06:56:00.000Z	DefineKThyne	bazhang	can you give me some pointers? i already have all the codecs and restricted extras installed.
2008-05-03T06:56:00.000Z	bazhang	DefineKThyne	what drm--link and I will test
2008-05-03T06:57:00.000Z	DefineKThyne	bazhang	i'm just asking for a friend who asked me, tbh.
2008-05-03T06:57:00.000Z	bazhang	DefineKThyne	no idea without a link-->ask your friend for the link
2008-05-03T06:58:00.000Z	DefineKThyne	bazhang	 i'll take a look around, i think i remember what she was talking about. in the meantime, what has an effect on whether or not the stream will work?
2008-05-03T06:59:00.000Z	bazhang	DefineKThyne	no time for an inchannel tutorial sorry-->if you get the link let me know however
2008-05-03T07:00:00.000Z	DefineKThyne	bazhang	thats fine. Do you think could you give me an idea where to look for a tutorial then?
2008-05-03T07:01:00.000Z	bazhang	DefineKThyne	what is the drm type
2008-05-03T07:01:00.000Z	DefineKThyne	bazhang	i think she was working with an encrypted WMV
2008-05-03T07:05:00.000Z	DefineKThyne	bazhang	couldn't she maybe run the stream through a browser on WINE?
2008-05-03T07:07:00.000Z	bazhang	DefineKThyne	really need to know drm type thanks
