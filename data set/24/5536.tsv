2007-06-13T12:14:00.000Z	visham		any nmap users here?
2007-06-13T12:16:00.000Z	visham		i use kununtu 6.06 and 'nmap -sS -T4 -O scanme.nmap.org' breaks my internet connection after few minutes
2007-06-13T12:16:00.000Z	visham		whats the problem?
2007-06-13T12:16:00.000Z	visham		i use adsl modem and dlink ethernet card
2007-06-13T12:17:00.000Z	ompaul	visham	is your isp watching you and saying "no"
2007-06-13T12:17:00.000Z	visham	ompaul	no my isp is dumb
2007-06-13T12:18:00.000Z	visham	ompaul	is there some low level packet handling stuff that freezes my ethernet card
2007-06-13T12:19:00.000Z	visham	ompaul	has similar problems be reported
2007-06-13T12:19:00.000Z	ompaul	visham	check launchpad.net for your hardware
2007-06-13T12:20:00.000Z	visham	ompaul	my guess is the the ethernet card is unable to handle the load nmap generates
2007-06-13T12:21:00.000Z	ompaul	visham	that should not cause a freeze, unless you have some silly card, and really without access to the box how is anyone going to know and the theory is a bit strange, as the stack should not try to drive more than the card can take
2007-06-13T12:23:00.000Z	visham	ompaul	any other reasons why nmap breaks the connection
2007-06-13T12:24:00.000Z	visham	ompaul	or is there a bug in nmap itself which is unreported
2007-06-13T12:24:00.000Z	ompaul	visham	lots of possible ones, search for it on launchpad.net
2007-06-13T12:25:00.000Z	visham	ompaul	i tried it already
2007-06-13T12:25:00.000Z	ompaul	visham	so report it then
2007-06-13T12:26:00.000Z	visham	ompaul	i even checked various setting on my ethernet card and ran nmap under each condition but no solution
2007-06-13T12:26:00.000Z	ompaul	visham	please go to launchpad.net or the nmap site and compile the latest and see if it happens then report the bug you find
2007-06-13T12:27:00.000Z	visham	ompaul	on one occasion dmesg show that the interface eth1(ethernet card) is in promiscuous mod
2007-06-13T12:27:00.000Z	visham	ompaul	on one occasion dmesg show that the interface eth1(ethernet card) is in promiscuous mode
2007-06-13T12:27:00.000Z	visham	ompaul	what does that mean
2007-06-13T12:27:00.000Z	ompaul	visham	it is listening to all packets
2007-06-13T12:28:00.000Z	visham	ompaul	thank you
