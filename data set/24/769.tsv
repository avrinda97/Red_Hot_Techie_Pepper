2011-03-04T07:00:00.000Z	Crayboff		damn he pinged out
2011-03-04T07:02:00.000Z	Crayboff		ok guys i need help with manually specifying partitions for the install. i already created when i went through the usual Install alongside other operating system
2011-03-04T07:02:00.000Z	Crayboff		i unfortunately have no clue what i'm doing
2011-03-04T07:03:00.000Z	Crayboff		hey lucky! it's me craybot2
2011-03-04T07:04:00.000Z	Crayboff		gimpy i already created one partition (unless the auto made multiple)
2011-03-04T07:05:00.000Z	Crayboff		lucky: how do i select the partition it made the first time i do this
2011-03-04T07:06:00.000Z	Crayboff		gimpy: here's what happened. i went through the normal auto partitioner, but the installation hung up. so i restarted my computer and i want to install on the partitions that where already made
2011-03-04T07:08:00.000Z	Crayboff		i'm at the custom partition page and i dont want to break it
2011-03-04T07:08:00.000Z	Crayboff		goddammit he quit :(
2011-03-04T07:09:00.000Z	Crayboff		can some one please help me navigate this custom partition page in the installer?
2011-03-04T07:10:00.000Z	Starminn	Crayboff	What are you trying to do?
2011-03-04T07:12:00.000Z	Starminn	Crayboff	Alright, so what does the custom partitioner show? (Also to be noted, are you dual-booting? If so, I wound up having ot defrag and CHKDSK Windows before it let me install Ubuntu)
2011-03-04T07:18:00.000Z	Starminn	Crayboff	Okay, so you want to click on the ext4 and set the "mount point" as "/" (root)
2011-03-04T07:22:00.000Z	Starminn	Crayboff	IT's already formatted as ext4 which is *perfect*. All you've got to do now is set the mount point as "/" (a slash)
2011-03-04T07:22:00.000Z	Starminn	Crayboff	Whatever the default is should be fine.
2011-03-04T07:24:00.000Z	Starminn	Crayboff	Just double-check everything. Your ext4 partition should have a mount point of "/", the size of the partitions are measured in MB, and your swap should of course be mount point os "swap area"
2011-03-04T07:24:00.000Z	Starminn	Crayboff	Alright
2011-03-04T07:27:00.000Z	Starminn	Crayboff	You said you had /dev/sda6(swap). So, remember how you set your ext4 to mount point of "/"?  Just do the same thing for your swap but say "use as: swap area".
2011-03-04T07:27:00.000Z	Starminn	Crayboff	Alright.
2011-03-04T07:31:00.000Z	Starminn	Crayboff	 Username has to be in lower-case.
2011-03-04T07:32:00.000Z	Starminn	Crayboff	I agree. I pissed me off that it wouldn't allow upper-case, but that's not too bad. IT's REALLY bad that they don't inform you of that. That really irks me.
2011-03-04T07:32:00.000Z	Starminn	Crayboff	:) I try.
2011-03-04T07:32:00.000Z	Starminn	Crayboff	First-time Linux user or what?
2011-03-04T07:33:00.000Z	Starminn	Crayboff	Fair enough, fair enough. Alright, well if you h ave any more questions, just hop on back and me or somebody else will certainly see what we can do to help. ;)
