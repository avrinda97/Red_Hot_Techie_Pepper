2008-08-04T23:17:00.000Z	Ketsuban		Sorry for doubleposting this, but it's really quite serious since it's actively preventing me using my system completely. Once my system has been up for a day things start going wrong - Firefox refuses to open, Terminal crashes on load. X-Chat is the only program I have open, and if I close it I will lose the ability to use it completely. Can I fix this behaviour?
2008-08-04T23:18:00.000Z	Ketsuban		I really don't want to reboot every day to keep my system working.
2008-08-04T23:19:00.000Z	jazzkutya	Ketsuban	do you have firefox open when this occurs?
2008-08-04T23:19:00.000Z	Ketsuban	jazzkutya	No. anto9us: seems to be.
2008-08-04T23:20:00.000Z	jazzkutya	Ketsuban	keep a terminal open and wait until this happens again, then start another terminal or any other app from the already open terminal. this way you will see the error message
2008-08-04T23:21:00.000Z	Ketsuban	jazzkutya	The problem is it's not something which just goes away. I'm currently in it, and I'd really like to deal with it so I don't have to reboot all the time. If it went away of its own accord I'd happily do that.
2008-08-04T23:22:00.000Z	jazzkutya	Ketsuban	maybe you can try this already from x-chat: /exec gnome-terminal or something
2008-08-04T23:22:00.000Z	Ketsuban	jazzkutya	No error message AFAICT from using /exec.
2008-08-04T23:23:00.000Z	jazzkutya	Ketsuban	try /exec xterm if this happens to success you can try starting other things from it and see the error message
2008-08-04T23:24:00.000Z	jazzkutya	Ketsuban	otherwise my only advice is reboot and keep a terminal open for next time it happens
2008-08-04T23:24:00.000Z	Ketsuban	jazzkutya	xterm works.
2008-08-04T23:24:00.000Z	jazzkutya	Ketsuban	okay try start gnome-terminal
2008-08-04T23:25:00.000Z	Ketsuban	jazzkutya	I did. Still no error message.
2008-08-04T23:25:00.000Z	jazzkutya	Ketsuban	did you get back a prompt without any message?
2008-08-04T23:25:00.000Z	Ketsuban		It opened the gnome-terminal window which hung instantly.
2008-08-04T23:26:00.000Z	Ketsuban		No errors on the console, just "Killed" when I force-quitted.
2008-08-04T23:27:00.000Z	jazzkutya	Ketsuban	check resources from the xterm, like df -h and free -m
2008-08-04T23:27:00.000Z	jazzkutya	Ketsuban	and the last few lines of dmesg can be helpful too
2008-08-04T23:28:00.000Z	Ketsuban	jazzkutya	According to this I have only 100MB of memory free.
2008-08-04T23:28:00.000Z	jazzkutya	Ketsuban	watch the second line that starts with +/- buffers but 100MB free should be already okay
2008-08-04T23:30:00.000Z	jazzkutya	Ketsuban	and try starting other apps from the xterm, like gthumb, xv
2008-08-04T23:30:00.000Z	jazzkutya	Ketsuban	and firefox
2008-08-04T23:31:00.000Z	Ketsuban	jazzkutya	firefox just hangs until I hit Ctrl-C.
2008-08-04T23:33:00.000Z	jazzkutya	Ketsuban	can you start xman? xmag?
