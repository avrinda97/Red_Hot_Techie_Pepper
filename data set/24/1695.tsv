2010-01-31T03:05:00.000Z	futurama140		hey, im having problems installing my nvidia graphics card, http://pastebin.com/d7e420704 can someone help me please?
2010-01-31T03:06:00.000Z	pfifo	futurama140	what graphics card are you using?
2010-01-31T03:07:00.000Z	futurama140	pfifo	nvidia geforce 210
2010-01-31T03:11:00.000Z	pfifo	futurama140	well its saying that your particular chip isnt supported by the 180.44 driver... what version of ubuntu are you on?
2010-01-31T03:12:00.000Z	futurama140	pfifo	9.04
2010-01-31T03:12:00.000Z	pfifo	futurama140	you should be able to install the 185 driver, System -> Administration -> Hardware Drivers
2010-01-31T03:13:00.000Z	futurama140	pfifo	earlier two people told me just to install whatever the newest nvidia driver was, and 180 sounded good so i did that. i have no clue what im doing. i just installed ubuntu the other day, still reading through this massive book trying to learn
2010-01-31T03:13:00.000Z	pfifo	futurama140	180 isnt the newest :)
2010-01-31T03:14:00.000Z	futurama140	pfifo	the hardware driver program says "no proprietary drivers are in use on this system"
2010-01-31T03:14:00.000Z	futurama140	pfifo	note: i rebooted, and now i am running in low graphics mode
2010-01-31T03:14:00.000Z	pfifo	futurama140	you ashould be able to activate 185 from that menu
2010-01-31T03:15:00.000Z	futurama140	pfifo	that menu has absolutely no options at all.
2010-01-31T03:16:00.000Z	pfifo	futurama140	ok that isnt good, I dont know why it wouldn't show up.
2010-01-31T03:17:00.000Z	futurama140	pfifo	how do i uninstall the incorrect drivers that i have?
2010-01-31T03:18:00.000Z	pfifo	futurama140	What did you do to install it?
2010-01-31T03:18:00.000Z	futurama140	pfifo	sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx-180
2010-01-31T03:19:00.000Z	pfifo	futurama140	sudo apt-get remove nvidia-glx-180
2010-01-31T03:19:00.000Z	futurama140	pfifo	ok and you say i should install 185?
2010-01-31T03:20:00.000Z	pfifo	futurama140	yes
2010-01-31T03:23:00.000Z	futurama140	pfifo	futurama140@futurama140-desktop:~$ sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx-185 Reading package lists... Done Building dependency tree        Reading state information... Done E: Couldn't find package nvidia-glx-185
2010-01-31T03:23:00.000Z	pfifo	futurama140	im not sure how to install the driver im talking about from the command line, I always use the gui. just a sec
2010-01-31T03:26:00.000Z	pfifo	futurama140	you need to run sudo apt-get update
2010-01-31T03:28:00.000Z	futurama140	pfifo	i updated, now what?
2010-01-31T03:29:00.000Z	pfifo	futurama140	I recommend upgrading to ubuntu 9.10 then, looks like 9.04 is outdated
