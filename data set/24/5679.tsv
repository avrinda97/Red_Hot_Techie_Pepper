2006-05-27T05:05:00.000Z	Madpilot	Corey	google - I don't think it's in Ubuntu's repos
2006-05-27T05:09:00.000Z	Madpilot	Corey	the installed version is much faster
2006-05-27T05:12:00.000Z	Madpilot	Corey	just install alien thru Synaptic
2006-05-27T05:13:00.000Z	Madpilot	Corey	System->Admin->Synaptic Package Manager
2006-05-27T05:13:00.000Z	Madpilot	Corey	delete the file you just downloaded, you don't need that for alien
2006-05-27T10:50:00.000Z	Madpilot	Corey	enemy territory, if you're into first-person shootes
2006-05-27T10:53:00.000Z	Madpilot	Corey	no idea, I've never run it on Windows. I'd doubt it.
2006-05-27T11:08:00.000Z	Madpilot	Corey	try Alt+F2 and type "wesnoth"

2006-05-27T11:10:00.000Z	Madpilot	Corey	no, visit that URL for install info for ET
2006-05-27T13:21:00.000Z	Madpilot	Corey	that depends... but even if it breaks, you get to keep all the pieces ;)
2006-05-27T13:25:00.000Z	Madpilot	Corey	not your own user data, unless something goes badly wrong
