2008-06-29T12:14:00.000Z	pen		why is the systray not using the 16x16 icon while the panel has been resized to 16
2008-06-29T12:14:00.000Z	maco	pen	i told you already that i think it needs a buffer
2008-06-29T12:14:00.000Z	maco	pen	the panel has to be 18, i think, so that it has a pixel above and a pixel below
2008-06-29T12:16:00.000Z	pen	maco	sorry, you highlight me now so I didn't see your previous comments
2008-06-29T12:16:00.000Z	pen	maco	so what you mean is that I need to set it to 16?
2008-06-29T12:16:00.000Z	pen	maco	so what you mean is that I need to set it to 18?
2008-06-29T12:16:00.000Z	maco	pen	yes, i think that'd work
2008-06-29T12:17:00.000Z	pen	maco	and should I restart the panel?
2008-06-29T12:17:00.000Z	maco	pen	how did you even get 16 as an option?  20's the smallest the properties thing lets me pick.  did you screw with gconf?
2008-06-29T12:17:00.000Z	maco	pen	should automatically resize
2008-06-29T12:17:00.000Z	pen	maco	no, I can pick to as low as 16
2008-06-29T12:18:00.000Z	pen	maco	well, your way doesn't work on me, set it to 18 doesn't change it
2008-06-29T12:18:00.000Z	pen	maco	for some
2008-06-29T12:18:00.000Z	pen	maco	others are just scaling
2008-06-29T12:18:00.000Z	pen	maco	not really using a different icon
2008-06-29T12:18:00.000Z	pen	maco	I know the icon for networkmanager has smaller icons for 16x16, but it's not using
2008-06-29T12:19:00.000Z	pen	maco	strange
2008-06-29T12:19:00.000Z	pen	maco	do you have any idea?
2008-06-29T12:20:00.000Z	maco	pen	nope...the others are all using svg though, i guess
2008-06-29T12:20:00.000Z	maco	pen	well, the other idea is that 18's still not big enough
2008-06-29T12:20:00.000Z	maco	pen	i dont know what kind of buffer it wants
2008-06-29T12:20:00.000Z	pen	maco	when will the panel actually uses the 16x16 icons
2008-06-29T12:21:00.000Z	pen	maco	 I have never seen any 16x16 icons been used during the half year of ubuntu experience
2008-06-29T12:24:00.000Z	maco	pen	dunno
