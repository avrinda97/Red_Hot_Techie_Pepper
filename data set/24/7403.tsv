2004-12-21T12:15:00.000Z	paradoxmo		that was somethin'
2004-12-21T12:15:00.000Z	paradoxmo		i meant to do it in another directory
2004-12-21T12:15:00.000Z	paradoxmo		charlie: what did you just upgrade?
2004-12-21T12:16:00.000Z	paradoxmo		(i mean: what kernel version to what kernel version, and what command did you use)
2004-12-21T12:17:00.000Z	paradoxmo		marska: ctrl-o
2004-12-21T12:17:00.000Z	paradoxmo		charlie: what's the last kernel that worked?
2004-12-21T12:18:00.000Z	paradoxmo		zAo: did you try looking through the listings of gimp-whatever and seeing if anything looks promising?
2004-12-21T12:18:00.000Z	paradoxmo		it's not in gimp-nonfree?
2004-12-21T12:18:00.000Z	charlie_	paradoxmo	: the 2.6.8.3-k7 before i installed the 9 one  i also tried new ddr but the faults don't go away, so i don't think it bad hardware..
2004-12-21T12:19:00.000Z	paradoxmo	charlie_	yeah, i don't think it's hardware
2004-12-21T12:19:00.000Z	charlie_	paradoxmo	what can it be then???
2004-12-21T12:19:00.000Z	paradoxmo		so 2.6.8.3 worked, but 2.6.9.1 doesn't?
2004-12-21T12:20:00.000Z	paradoxmo		and now if you reboot back into 2.6.8.3 it does the same thing?
2004-12-21T12:20:00.000Z	charlie_		yeah and now i'm with the 2.6.8.3 but still no xmms blender etc...
2004-12-21T12:20:00.000Z	paradoxmo		right.
2004-12-21T12:20:00.000Z	paradoxmo		marska: i believe readonly

2004-12-21T12:21:00.000Z	paradoxmo		and see if the problem goes away
2004-12-21T12:21:00.000Z	paradoxmo		marska: good luck
2004-12-21T12:22:00.000Z	paradoxmo		woohoo.
