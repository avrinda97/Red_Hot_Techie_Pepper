2006-12-24T15:32:00.000Z	sri		greetings.
2006-12-24T15:33:00.000Z	sri		so I'm having trouble installing Edgy on a new motherboard I just got.
2006-12-24T15:33:00.000Z	sri		it's a Asus p5b-e
2006-12-24T15:34:00.000Z	enyc	sri	hrrm livecd not boot?
2006-12-24T15:34:00.000Z	sri		the cdrom boots fine, but when I hit hte install it unpacks hte kenrel, gives me the screen... and the nhangs.
2006-12-24T15:34:00.000Z	sri		I probably do not have the latest bios.
2006-12-24T15:34:00.000Z	sri		livecd doesnt work
2006-12-24T15:34:00.000Z	enyc	sri	i would indeed reccomend asus bios update... usually needs fdd with AFUDOS.EXE and the BIOS file ...
2006-12-24T15:34:00.000Z	sri		but it does work on that motherboard?
2006-12-24T15:35:00.000Z	sri		fdd?
2006-12-24T15:35:00.000Z	enyc	sri	not sure.. try updanig the bios first
2006-12-24T15:35:00.000Z	sri		okay, I can try to do that.
2006-12-24T15:35:00.000Z	sri		it's worth a shot.
2006-12-24T15:35:00.000Z	enyc	sri	f/oppy drive -- thats how i normally flash bioses but there are other ways
2006-12-24T15:36:00.000Z	enyc	sri	ive used EPROM programmer
2006-12-24T15:36:00.000Z	sri		well the bios has a section to flash your computer
2006-12-24T15:36:00.000Z	enyc		I have definitely had some weird hard-disk-error behaviour that was cures but asus amibios update
2006-12-24T15:36:00.000Z	sri		so you hit "tools" and hten supposedly, you give the img file.
2006-12-24T15:36:00.000Z	sri		I believe I've done it a couple imes before, on intel motherboards.
2006-12-24T15:37:00.000Z	enyc	sri	some bioses have built-in flashreader that reads the bios imacge form floppydisk...  many you can just boot from bootable device which can boot dos with the bios file
2006-12-24T15:38:00.000Z	sri	enyc	nod.
2006-12-24T15:38:00.000Z	sri		I think I have one of htose
2006-12-24T15:38:00.000Z	sri		the asus bios is pretty fancy compared to others I've seen.
2006-12-24T15:38:00.000Z	enyc	sri	well they have fancy look... just nasnty amibios really ;-)
