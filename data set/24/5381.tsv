2007-03-29T07:26:00.000Z	bobslaede		haha Seveas, i have that
2007-03-29T07:26:00.000Z	bobslaede		i just cant ssh localhost
2007-03-29T07:26:00.000Z	bobslaede		permission denied
2007-03-29T07:27:00.000Z	bobslaede		ssh is hashed (/usr/bin/ssh)
2007-03-29T07:27:00.000Z	bobslaede		i can ssh fine to the machine from other computers..
2007-03-29T07:29:00.000Z	bobslaede		eh Pici, yeah, invalid user...
2007-03-29T07:29:00.000Z	bobslaede		hmm..
2007-03-29T07:30:00.000Z	bobslaede		doing this
2007-03-29T07:31:00.000Z	bobslaede		Nevermind folks...
2007-03-29T07:32:00.000Z	bobslaede		apprently then, i cant ssh localhost from other users...
2007-03-29T07:33:00.000Z	compilerwriter	bobslaede	you should be able to ssh to localhost; at least I think you should be able to.
2007-03-29T07:34:00.000Z	bobslaede	compilerwriter	yeah, i would think so too
2007-03-29T07:35:00.000Z	compilerwriter	bobslaede	are you certain that your ssh server is up and running properly.
2007-03-29T07:35:00.000Z	compilerwriter		haekke I am thinking that that is just a bad idea.
2007-03-29T07:36:00.000Z	bobslaede	compilerwriter	yeah
2007-03-29T07:37:00.000Z	bobslaede	compilerwriter	i had "AllowUsers nx" in sshd_config..
2007-03-29T07:37:00.000Z	bobslaede	compilerwriter	apparently that stoped me from ssh'ing localhost...
2007-03-29T07:38:00.000Z	compilerwriter	bobslaede	It would have allowed user nx and only user nx to ssh to the machine period.
2007-03-29T07:38:00.000Z	bobslaede	compilerwriter	you sure? wouldnt that throw me off my current session with another user?
2007-03-29T07:39:00.000Z	compilerwriter		That stuff would only have gotten reread at the next time the ssh server fired up.
2007-03-29T07:39:00.000Z	compilerwriter		blbslaede what are you trying to accomplish with ssh anyway.
2007-03-29T07:39:00.000Z	bobslaede	compilerwriter	a nx server thing...
2007-03-29T07:40:00.000Z	bobslaede	compilerwriter	terminal server stuff... which doesnt work anyway...
2007-03-29T07:40:00.000Z	bobslaede	compilerwriter	but i restarted the ssh server
