2012-04-24T15:19:00.000Z	iceroot_	bouma	https://bugs.launchpad.net/packagename  to go directly to it
2012-04-24T15:19:00.000Z	bouma	iceroot_	basically i cant find an existing bug but, ive used 'update manager' and it showed some important security updates. then i went into settings and changed it to download automatically, then closed the 'settings panel' and updatemanager added the currently pending important security updates to the list again. i can take a screen cap.
2012-04-24T15:19:00.000Z	iceroot_	bouma	so your issue is that the update manager wants to redownlaod the package?
2012-04-24T15:20:00.000Z	iceroot_	bouma	ah the issue is that it is not automaticly downloading
2012-04-24T15:21:00.000Z	bouma	iceroot_	no my issue is that the list displayed by update manager duplicates the info. actually it lists the same 3 things 3 times, for a total of 9 entries, 6 are duplicates
2012-04-24T15:21:00.000Z	iceroot_	bouma	download a package does not mean install the package, so its correct that it is remebering you about the update
2012-04-24T15:21:00.000Z	iceroot_	bouma	can you paste a screenshot?
2012-04-24T15:21:00.000Z	iceroot_		!paste | bouma
2012-04-24T15:21:00.000Z	bouma		iceroot_:yes im uploading
2012-04-24T15:21:00.000Z	iceroot_	bouma	thank you
2012-04-24T15:29:00.000Z	bouma	iceroot_	http://imgur.com/hj1Rr here is the bug showing repeated security update items
2012-04-24T15:29:00.000Z	bouma	iceroot_	i havent closed the window in case there is more data i can collect
2012-04-24T15:31:00.000Z	iceroot_	bouma	can you paste the output of "apt-cache policy chromium-browser"?
2012-04-24T15:48:00.000Z	bouma	iceroot_	http://pastebin.com/mtHaMCbh here is ap-cache policy chromium-browser
2012-04-24T15:52:00.000Z	iceroot_	bouma	you should open a bug against the update-manager, add your screenshot and the output of apt-cache policy to that bug. the bug seems that tere are more then one sources for the patch with the same version
2012-04-24T15:52:00.000Z	iceroot_		!bug | bouma
2012-04-24T15:53:00.000Z	bouma	iceroot_	so is there any other info i can collect from the running program or should i just close it. i may be able to recreate it
2012-04-24T15:54:00.000Z	iceroot_	bouma	i guess the screenshot + apt-cache policy are enough for the bug report
2012-04-24T15:54:00.000Z	bouma	iceroot_	because at first the list was not duplicated, it was after i clicked on settings, made changes and returned
2012-04-24T15:54:00.000Z	iceroot_	bouma	you can install the packages, there is no critical bug on that, just a display error
2012-04-24T15:54:00.000Z	iceroot_	bouma	provide that info too on the bug report but i guess the bug is the oneiric-updates and oneiric-security repo
2012-04-24T15:55:00.000Z	bouma	iceroot_	right, but its good to get bugs recognised that may lead to code errors with multiple implications
2012-04-24T15:55:00.000Z	iceroot_	bouma	of course
