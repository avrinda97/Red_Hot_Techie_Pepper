2011-09-14T00:17:00.000Z	plummerb		Hello folks.  I need help getting SNMP setup and configured.  Would that be here or another channel?
2011-09-14T00:18:00.000Z	cfedde	plummerb	more than just installing the packages?
2011-09-14T00:20:00.000Z	cfedde	plummerb	there are several reasonable hits just googling for ubuntu snmpd.
2011-09-14T00:21:00.000Z	cfedde	plummerb	they mostly degenerate into: apt-get install snmpd snmp snmp-mibs-downloader, and then fixing /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf and /etc/snmp.conf
2011-09-14T00:22:00.000Z	cfedde	plummerb	the operative word here is "correctly"
2011-09-14T00:22:00.000Z	cfedde	plummerb	by default the snmp agent will answer to v2c requrests with community string "public"
2011-09-14T00:23:00.000Z	cfedde	plummerb	the comments in /etc/snmpd.conf are also reasonably helpful.  But there is so much policy going on that it is tough to know what is right for any given site.
2011-09-14T00:24:00.000Z	cfedde	plummerb	the easiest way to get started is to read through the comments in /etc/snmpd.conf and set the community string to something other than public.
2011-09-14T00:25:00.000Z	cfedde	plummerb	then try to talk to the agent using "snmpwalk -v2c -c public"
2011-09-14T00:26:00.000Z	cfedde	plummerb	ah! does the agent respond to simple requests?
2011-09-14T00:28:00.000Z	cfedde	plummerb	and do you get a response when you use the public address?
2011-09-14T00:31:00.000Z	cfedde	plummerb	then it seems like the agent is configred properly.
2011-09-14T00:31:00.000Z	cfedde	plummerb	do you get symbolic oid in the responses? or just a list of dotted numbers?
2011-09-14T00:34:00.000Z	cfedde	plummerb	pastebin is blocked from where I'm sitting.  go figure.
2011-09-14T00:36:00.000Z	cfedde	plummerb	when you run "snmpwalk -Of -v1 -cpublic your.host.name | grep ipNetToPhysicalTable" should be the arp table
2011-09-14T00:40:00.000Z	cfedde	plummerb	if you want the symbolic values.
2011-09-14T00:46:00.000Z	cfedde	plummerb	in /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf the line that starts "rocommunity" decides what is visible with community string "public"
2011-09-14T00:48:00.000Z	cfedde	plummerb	if you make a line "view plummerb included .1.3.6" then "rocommunity plummerb default -V plummerb"  you'll get the full tree if you use plummerb as the communtity string.
2011-09-14T00:49:00.000Z	cfedde	plummerb	you'll also have to restart snmpd for the above to take effect.
2011-09-14T00:52:00.000Z	cfedde	plummerb	I'd expect something like that to work.  Or to trim your rocommunity line down to just the .1.3.6 oid
2011-09-14T00:53:00.000Z	cfedde	plummerb	the key in the vew lines is to allow different groups of managers to have visibility of different oid subtrees.
2011-09-14T00:57:00.000Z	cfedde	plummerb	that's proibably because your snmpwalk can't find the mib files.
2011-09-14T00:58:00.000Z	cfedde	plummerb	if you want the symbolic oid then you need to add snmp-mibs-downloader package and comment out the mib: line in /etc/snmp/snmp.conf (note no "d")
2011-09-14T01:05:00.000Z	cfedde	plummerb	sorry. walked away.  the mib files have documentation inside them.
