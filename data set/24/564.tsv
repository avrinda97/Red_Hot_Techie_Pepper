2011-06-01T11:01:00.000Z	josephnexus_1		hi everyone!
2011-06-01T11:02:00.000Z	josephnexus_1		i'm trying to get 11.04 working on a desktop computer with an ati radeon 4650 graphics card.  It runs, but very very slowly
2011-06-01T11:02:00.000Z	josephnexus_1		running glx gears yeilds about 400 FPS
2011-06-01T11:03:00.000Z	josephnexus_1		this is after installing the proprietary drivers... anyone else experiencing this?
2011-06-01T11:03:00.000Z	josephnexus_1		before installing the proprietary drivers, performance was still bad.
2011-06-01T11:03:00.000Z	RevSpecies116	josephnexus_1	That is normal
2011-06-01T11:04:00.000Z	josephnexus_1	RevSpecies116	in my  reading, i've seen that I should be able to get about 4000 FPS in GLX Gears
2011-06-01T11:05:00.000Z	RevSpecies116	josephnexus_1	Perfectly normal - and not to worry, human eyes can't tell the difference between 400 or 4000 FPS
2011-06-01T11:05:00.000Z	RevSpecies116	josephnexus_1	Unity runs that bad with the proprietary drivers?
2011-06-01T11:07:00.000Z	RevSpecies116	josephnexus_1	See this link for an unbiased benchmarking - http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=linux_desktop_managers1&num=1
2011-06-01T11:09:00.000Z	josephnexus_1	RevSpecies116	If fedora performs better I guess I just file a bug report?
2011-06-01T11:10:00.000Z	RevSpecies116	josephnexus_1	yes, that is the best course of action.
2011-06-01T11:10:00.000Z	josephnexus_1	RevSpecies116	yeah, i really like ubuntu... it's just issues like this that need the occasional squashing
2011-06-01T11:11:00.000Z	josephnexus_1	RevSpecies116	the issue isn't just unity
2011-06-01T11:16:00.000Z	josephnexus_1	RevSpecies116	the driver ubuntu suggests is from 2009?
2011-06-01T11:17:00.000Z	RevSpecies116	josephnexus_1	That is dated. You are on 11.04? AMD dropped all kinds of support for X-Server with Catalyst 11.5
2011-06-01T11:23:00.000Z	RevSpecies116	josephnexus_1	it doesn't - I can't find it there either ;)
2011-06-01T11:41:00.000Z	RevSpecies116	josephnexus_1	Crossing my toes too

2011-06-01T11:26:00.000Z	josephnexus_1	RevSpecies116	i saw that.... i think i found that using the advanced search on the ati site
2011-06-01T11:28:00.000Z	RevSpecies116	josephnexus_1	I trust the following link better, as the linked site I have used before - all the way back with 8.04 :) http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu_Natty_Installation_Guide
2011-06-01T11:42:00.000Z	josephnexus_1	RevSpecies116	dang... this package build step is taking forever
2011-06-01T11:48:00.000Z	josephnexus_1	RevSpecies116	no reason to become a contortionist over this
2011-06-01T11:51:00.000Z	josephnexus_1	RevSpecies116	performance is the same... or worse
