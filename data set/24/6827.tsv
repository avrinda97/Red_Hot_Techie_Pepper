2005-07-08T14:33:00.000Z	jtan325		but nothing really about toem
2005-07-08T14:33:00.000Z	jtan325		hmmm or maybe i am just assuming this repository is in my sources.list
2005-07-08T14:33:00.000Z	jtan325		i apologize, i should've checked that first
2005-07-08T14:34:00.000Z	jtan325		!restrictedformats
2005-07-08T14:35:00.000Z	jtan325		yeah and i have the repository in my sources.list already
2005-07-08T14:37:00.000Z	jtan325		and my totem player isn't doing anything
2005-07-08T14:39:00.000Z	jtan325		man, so when i try to play any movie in totem, it just closes by itself
2005-07-08T14:40:00.000Z	jtan325		but i can hear a little bit of sound
2005-07-08T14:40:00.000Z	jtan325		and then it just closes
2005-07-08T14:40:00.000Z	AMDXP	jtan325	get the xine plugin
2005-07-08T14:40:00.000Z	jtan325	AMDXP	ahhh thank you
2005-07-08T14:41:00.000Z	AMDXP	jtan325	i had the same problem and it plays fine now
2005-07-08T14:41:00.000Z	jtan325	AMDXP	you would think there'd be a dependency or something in synaptic
2005-07-08T14:41:00.000Z	AMDXP	jtan325	i learned that from reading the forums
2005-07-08T14:43:00.000Z	jtan325	AMDXP	did you mean "totem-xine"?
2005-07-08T14:43:00.000Z	AMDXP	jtan325	yes
2005-07-08T14:44:00.000Z	AMDXP	jtan325	you already installed it?
2005-07-08T14:44:00.000Z	AMDXP	jtan325	i had no problem with mpg
2005-07-08T14:32:00.000Z	AMDXP	jtan325	you still having problems seeing movies
2005-07-08T14:32:00.000Z	jtan325	AMDXP	it works fine in mplayer
2005-07-08T14:33:00.000Z	AMDXP	jtan325	that is funny i can't get mplayer to work it crashes on me
2005-07-08T14:33:00.000Z	jtan325	AMDXP	i am just curious how it can work in mplayer but not in xine
2005-07-08T14:34:00.000Z	jtan325	AMDXP	what do you use for the video driver in xine?
