2007-03-01T07:40:00.000Z	mykk		how long does a normal install take?
2007-03-01T07:40:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mykk	about 30min for me.
2007-03-01T07:53:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mykk	i really think you should try the alternate install CD
2007-03-01T07:54:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mykk	 its a text based installer(don't let that scare you, its not hard)....
2007-03-01T07:54:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mykk	sometimes when pc's have probs with the regular installer, the alternate install gets them through it.
2007-03-01T07:55:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mykk	http://www.ubuntu.com go to the download section, and then download something like Ubuntu 6.10 Alternate install.iso
2007-03-01T07:57:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mykk	why back to windows?
2007-03-01T07:58:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mykk	ok... did you find it?
2007-03-01T07:58:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mykk	its a text based installer, but its not hard..
2007-03-01T07:59:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mykk	 my laptop for example, i can't use the live cd installer, but the alternate CD installs just fine... don't know why
2007-03-01T07:59:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mykk	hang on a sec.
2007-03-01T08:00:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mykk	do you have Yahoo?
2007-03-01T08:01:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mykk	i'm talking about under Windows.
2007-03-01T08:02:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mykk	that would be a bad idea(5.04 upgrade)
2007-03-01T08:02:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mykk	hold on, i'm gonna send you a link.
2007-03-01T08:03:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mykk	  http://www.ubuntu.com/products/GetUbuntu/download?action=show&redirect=download
2007-03-01T08:04:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mykk	just remember
2007-03-01T08:04:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mykk	 you won't be able to get online with the alternate install CD
2007-03-01T08:06:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mykk	not you buddy,
2007-03-01T08:06:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mykk	i mean you won't be able to get online while its installing, like the live CD
2007-03-01T08:10:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mykk	 not bad, just not paying to much attention
2007-03-01T08:12:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mykk	now when you burn it to your disk
2007-03-01T08:13:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mykk	burn it at a slow pace, 2-4x.. takes longer, but for some reason, it does make a difference
2007-03-01T08:23:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mykk	you'd be amazed how often that fixes probs..
