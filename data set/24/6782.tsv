2005-08-01T14:48:00.000Z	IceDC571		but it doesnt render most webpages correctly
2005-08-01T05:25:00.000Z	IceDC571		i love compiling from source :)
2005-08-01T05:25:00.000Z	tanki	IceDC571	yeah I used to compile stuff from source and watch the screen and feel important, as if i knew what was going on
2005-08-01T05:26:00.000Z	tanki	IceDC571	when people were in my room I would randomly compile something and have it run in a nice term in fullscreen, just to make them think I was doing something important
2005-08-01T05:26:00.000Z	IceDC571		i love how you try to guess when the make process is finished.. it just keeps going and going and going..
2005-08-01T05:27:00.000Z	IceDC571		if i was on a reality show all you would see is me, a chair, a screen with text scrolling constantly
2005-08-01T05:27:00.000Z	tanki	IceDC571	haha yes but i think you and me need to go to a bar and pick up women because that's too geeky

2005-08-01T05:28:00.000Z	tanki		no way girls at cybercafe's have bubblebutts hehe
2005-08-01T05:28:00.000Z	tanki		oh and that's assuming you can find a girl at a cybercafe
2005-08-01T05:29:00.000Z	tanki		never date girls online because they're probably 40 year old virgins called matt who live at home and collect comics
