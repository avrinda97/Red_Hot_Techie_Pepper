2009-05-19T20:22:00.000Z	Pici	friendishan	I'm not a bot, but please stop pressing enter between every word, its annoying.
2009-05-19T20:23:00.000Z	Pici	friendishan	What sort of theme did you download? What file type are you trying to install?
2009-05-19T20:23:00.000Z	Pici	friendishan	Where did you get it from?
2009-05-19T20:24:00.000Z	Pici	friendishan	gnome-look?
2009-05-19T20:27:00.000Z	Pici	friendishan	What type of theme did you download? gtk? metacity? etc?
2009-05-19T20:28:00.000Z	Pici	friendishan	GDM themes need to be installed via System>Administration>Login Window (or similar name, I don't have a gui session in front of me)
2009-05-19T20:29:00.000Z	Pici	friendishan	All of that is documented in https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuEyeCandy as well, which ubottu gave you already.
2009-05-26T19:20:00.000Z	Pici	friendishan	you forgot the 'install'
2009-06-22T17:26:00.000Z	Pici	friendishan	Looks to be some sort of tor client...
2009-06-22T17:27:00.000Z	friendishan	Pici	in synaptic package manager the description it's written anonymity manager for KDE
2009-06-22T17:28:00.000Z	Pici	friendishan	Indeed. But its also capitalized as TorK and one of the package recommendations is tor
2009-06-22T17:29:00.000Z	friendishan	Pici	so that means TorK and tor are same
2009-09-16T20:16:00.000Z	Pici	friendishan	I'd start with a fresh profile and see if the problem persists.
2009-09-16T20:16:00.000Z	friendishan	Pici	i did not get you?
