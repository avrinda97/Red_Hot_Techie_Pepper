2012-08-21T16:12:00.000Z	usr13	amr_	If you look at it, and compare to other lines, you will probably see.  #
2012-08-21T16:13:00.000Z	usr13	amr_	You will see other lines with  #   as first character.
2012-08-21T16:14:00.000Z	usr13	amr_	You should show us
2012-08-21T16:15:00.000Z	usr13	amr_	Can you read?
2012-08-21T16:15:00.000Z	usr13	amr_	                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
2012-08-21T16:16:00.000Z	usr13	amr_	lsb_release -r
2012-08-21T16:17:00.000Z	usr13	amr_	 What does it say?
2012-08-21T16:17:00.000Z	usr13	amr_	  Have you done a distribution upgrade?
2012-08-21T16:18:00.000Z	usr13	amr_	Then how did those lines get in there?
2012-08-21T16:18:00.000Z	usr13	amr_	You must have a network problem
2012-08-21T16:19:00.000Z	usr13	amr_	sudo apt-get update
2012-08-21T16:19:00.000Z	usr13	amr_	You must edit as in admin mode  sudo  gsudo
2012-08-21T16:20:00.000Z	usr13	amr_	gksudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
2012-08-21T16:20:00.000Z	usr13	amr_	Solve your network problem and upload the file to paste.ubuntu.com
2012-08-21T16:22:00.000Z	usr13	amr_	Did you look at the date of the file before you edited it?  (It might give you a clue as to what happened to it.)
2012-08-21T16:24:00.000Z	usr13	amr_	You probably should have just changed the words lucid to precise
2012-08-21T16:26:00.000Z	amr_	usr13	i did what you said and it's working fine
2012-08-21T16:26:00.000Z	usr13	amr_	If you change it again, do apt-get update  (And from now on, if you add repositories, watch what you are doing, use the application that does it for you).
2012-08-21T16:26:00.000Z	amr_	usr13	thank you
2012-08-21T16:27:00.000Z	usr13	amr_	see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RecommendedSources
