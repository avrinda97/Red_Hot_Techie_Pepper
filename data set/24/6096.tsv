2006-01-20T17:45:00.000Z	jnk	dibblego	double check that both Master and PCM are not muted, and are not at zero
2006-01-20T17:45:00.000Z	dibblego	jnk	where is the master? I can see PCM under 'Volume Control'
2006-01-20T17:45:00.000Z	jnk	dibblego	maybe check that you're controlling the alsa driver (one never knows)
2006-01-20T17:45:00.000Z	jnk	dibblego	can you run "alsamixer" in aterminal ?
2006-01-20T17:46:00.000Z	dibblego	jnk	I'm too noob to know what that means sorry - I have 1 hour experience with Linux
2006-01-20T17:46:00.000Z	dibblego	jnk	yes
2006-01-20T17:46:00.000Z	jnk	dibblego	ok, what are you using? ubuntu with gnome? kubuntu ?
2006-01-20T17:46:00.000Z	jnk	dibblego	alsamixer is ok ?
2006-01-20T17:46:00.000Z	dibblego	jnk	ubuntu with gnome - a simple install off the CD ISO
2006-01-20T17:47:00.000Z	jnk	dibblego	if alsamixer works, you can see the master column, and the pcm column right?
2006-01-20T17:47:00.000Z	jnk	dibblego	ok it's just a different alsa driver I guess
2006-01-20T17:48:00.000Z	jnk	dibblego	well just check all columns related to output are not at zero, and that you don't  have 'MM' at the bottom (but 'OO' instead)
2006-01-20T17:48:00.000Z	jnk	dibblego	type 'm' :)
2006-01-20T17:49:00.000Z	jnk	dibblego	what was the column which prevented output?
2006-01-20T17:55:00.000Z	jnk	dibblego	and can you change device from the file menu?
2006-01-20T17:50:00.000Z	jnk	dibblego	just wondering why you couldn't change it in the graphical interface... you opened the sound control from the panel on top of the screen right?
2006-01-20T17:51:00.000Z	dibblego	jnk	yes I did, but it had slightly different options
2006-01-20T17:52:00.000Z	jnk	dibblego	can you check if you can change the device in the File menu of this sound control dialog?
2006-01-20T17:53:00.000Z	jnk	dibblego	yes, if you can choose between OSS and alsa you should choose alsa
2006-01-20T17:53:00.000Z	dibblego	jnk	there seems to be more options in alsamixer than 'Volume Control'
2006-01-20T17:54:00.000Z	jnk	dibblego	in the volume control you can choose what to display in Edit -> Preferences
2006-01-20T17:57:00.000Z	jnk	dibblego	so you still don't have a control for Front ?
2006-01-20T17:57:00.000Z	dibblego	jnk	yes I do now thanks
2006-01-20T17:57:00.000Z	jnk	dibblego	ok :)
