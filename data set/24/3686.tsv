2008-07-12T14:03:00.000Z	s3a	ere4si	k, thx
2008-07-12T14:03:00.000Z	ere4si	s3a	np :)
2008-07-12T14:08:00.000Z	s3a	ere4si	ppl develop python programs using the ubuntu terminal??
2008-07-12T14:08:00.000Z	ere4si	s3a	you can and some do
2008-07-12T14:09:00.000Z	s3a	ere4si	is there a more friendly way?
2008-07-12T14:10:00.000Z	ere4si	s3a	there is an ide for python in the repos - idle I think it is called
2008-07-12T14:11:00.000Z	s3a	ere4si	sry for not understanding u, this is my first time trying to learn python and im at the very beginning of diveintopython book and its also 5 11 am and im super tired and trying to learn programming lol
2008-07-12T14:11:00.000Z	s3a	ere4si	for the ide part i dint get
2008-07-12T14:12:00.000Z	s3a	ere4si	but how does that make it any different from wat i can do now if its still in terminal?
2008-07-12T14:12:00.000Z	ere4si	s3a	Integrated Developement Environment = ide
2008-07-12T14:12:00.000Z	ere4si	s3a	it is a gui environment for python
2008-07-12T14:16:00.000Z	s3a	ere4si	will using idle interfere in any way with the learning process of the diveintopython book im reading?
2008-07-12T14:16:00.000Z	ere4si	s3a	you'll get debug messages if the prog is wrong
2008-07-12T14:17:00.000Z	s3a	ere4si	in order to learn it do u recommend i dont install that package?
2008-07-12T14:18:00.000Z	ere4si	s3a	diff people work differently - I just write a script and run it - the ide I think is good for begginners
2008-07-12T14:19:00.000Z	s3a	ere4si	ay^: i dont get the things like "def buildConnectionString(params):
2008-07-12T14:21:00.000Z	ere4si	s3a	get some sleep and reread the howto for those points I would think is the best plan of attack at this hour :)
2008-07-12T14:21:00.000Z	s3a	ere4si	LOL im so tired i took the firefox logo for a heart
2008-07-12T14:22:00.000Z	s3a	ere4si	i rely should sleep and continue tomorow
2008-07-12T14:22:00.000Z	ere4si	s3a	best idea - good luck
2008-07-12T14:24:00.000Z	s3a	ere4si	ay^: by
