2005-12-02T17:28:00.000Z	lsuactiafner		but if you want to go insane run bleh with grsecurity and custum kernels, port knocking and no services ect
2005-12-02T17:29:00.000Z	lsuactiafner		debian has too many packages, if you want to run a server run barebones system
2005-12-02T17:31:00.000Z	lsuactiafner		only security i have is a firefox chroot
2005-12-02T17:32:00.000Z	lsuactiafner		mp3s run @ -10
2005-12-02T17:34:00.000Z	LjL	lsuactiafner	why do you think you can only renice root-started programs?
2005-12-02T17:34:00.000Z	LjL	lsuactiafner	you can run whatever program you like "@ -10", if i interpret that correctly, without running it as root
2005-12-02T17:35:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	LjL	: because running sudo is annoying, default programs should be 0, FAH -3 mp3s -10 fireofox -1
2005-12-02T17:35:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	LjL	: you need root to make it past -1
2005-12-02T17:37:00.000Z	LjL	lsuactiafner	no, you don't. you do need to *be* root for a moment, in order to renice the process, but you most definitely don't *need* (and *should not*) *run* the process as root
2005-12-02T17:37:00.000Z	LjL	lsuactiafner	it's your choice, of course, but be aware that it's a choice disapproved of by almost everyone with some attention to security
2005-12-02T17:37:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	LjL	: so running mp3blaster as root to access all mp3s with locate -i mp3s is comprimising me in what way?
2005-12-02T17:38:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	LjL	: i know
2005-12-02T17:38:00.000Z	LjL	lsuactiafner	yes, it is. who's telling you mp3blaster doesn't have any bad bugs?
2005-12-02T17:38:00.000Z	LjL	lsuactiafner	and, why should *not* running it as root prevent access to "all your mp3s"?
2005-12-02T17:39:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	LjL	: because mp3s are on two local disks, 4 remote disks, with various users
2005-12-02T17:39:00.000Z	LjL	lsuactiafner	if your user doesn't have read access on those, then your permissions are broken, fix them
2005-12-02T17:41:00.000Z	LjL	lsuactiafner	you run rootchecks often, and you run that kind of programs as root? at least be consistent...
2005-12-02T17:42:00.000Z	LjL	lsuactiafner	at that point, why not just login as root? i think it'll be easier for you
2005-12-02T17:42:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	LjL	: i do
2005-12-02T17:42:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	LjL	: i have 15 root consoles open atm.
2005-12-02T17:43:00.000Z	LjL	lsuactiafner	oh, well, what can i say. just please don't recommend this working style to others
2005-12-02T17:43:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	LjL	: no i dont
2005-12-04T14:04:00.000Z	LjL	lsuactiafner	really? why?
2005-12-04T14:04:00.000Z	LjL	lsuactiafner	suppose africa is not very linked?
