2009-07-07T06:34:00.000Z	lwells		But I thought when you used sudo, you are using the root?, no?
2009-07-07T06:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lwells	 sudo is a 'system' that lets users do some 'root privilage' actions. or it can let users run things as other users.
2009-07-07T06:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lwells	 thers mor to 'sudo' then 'doing things as root'
2009-07-07T06:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lwells	 sudo uses the USERS password - correct.
2009-07-07T06:36:00.000Z	lwells	Dr_Willis	but should there be a seperate pass for the root?
2009-07-07T06:37:00.000Z	lwells	Dr_Willis	so there are things I cannot do in root?
2009-07-09T04:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lwells	 as you are shutting down befor the pc powers off? not a big issue.. just how the card/memory is getting reset/displayed i imagine
2009-07-09T04:45:00.000Z	lwells	Dr_Willis	It is a normal shut down, happens everytime
2009-07-09T04:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lwells	 quirk of the video drivers/card. ivbe seen it on a few box's
2009-07-09T04:46:00.000Z	lwells	Dr_Willis	I have another thing, when I boot up I get "ACPI: expecting a [reference] package element, found type 0"
2009-07-09T04:47:00.000Z	lwells	Dr_Willis	Does not stop boot process, just looks funky
2009-07-09T04:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lwells	 just a warning about somthing.. not woth worrying about.
2009-07-09T06:55:00.000Z	lwells	Dr_Willis	Firefox 3.5 is still in beta for ubuntu right?
2009-07-09T06:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lwells	 thats what im hearing.
2009-10-02T22:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lwells	 any terminal app can be used to do ssh.
2009-10-02T22:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lwells	 ssh it a 'remote shell' unless you mean 'sftp' or somthing else..
2009-10-02T22:57:00.000Z	lwells	Dr_Willis	I want to use ssh, but want a gui client
2009-10-02T22:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lwells	  a gui client to do what exactly? You type in  shell commands once you make a 'ssh' connection.. so   im not sure what you are really wanting.
2009-10-02T22:59:00.000Z	lwells	Dr_Willis	I want to be able to drag files over, not just type the file names
2009-10-02T22:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lwells	 then you want a 'sftp' client. Not a 'ssh' client
2009-10-02T22:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lwells	 and most file managers can do sftp.
2009-10-02T22:59:00.000Z	lwells	Dr_Willis	yes i know that
2009-10-02T23:00:00.000Z	lwells	Dr_Willis	I want to be able to transfer files for web dev work
2009-10-02T23:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lwells	 i belive the gnome   connext --> to server. has a web dav option.. or it can connect via ssh/sftp and put an icon on your desktop
