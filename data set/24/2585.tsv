2010-04-14T12:09:00.000Z	raonid	Milosh	just put your question here
2010-04-14T12:12:00.000Z	raonid	Milosh	if the video or app has no sound, there's no problem?
2010-04-14T12:13:00.000Z	raonid	Milosh	that's really weird
2010-04-14T12:14:00.000Z	raonid	Milosh	sorry, I have no idea how to help
2010-04-14T12:14:00.000Z	raonid	Milosh	hmmm
2010-04-14T12:14:00.000Z	raonid	Milosh	you tried to install what driver?
2010-04-14T12:16:00.000Z	raonid	Milosh	for that I can try to help
2010-04-14T12:17:00.000Z	raonid	Milosh	you need not use the cli to see the installed packages
2010-04-14T12:17:00.000Z	raonid	Milosh	you can use Synaptic
2010-04-14T12:17:00.000Z	raonid	Milosh	it shows everything installed
2010-04-14T12:19:00.000Z	raonid	Milosh	can you tell us how did you installed the drivers by yourself?
2010-04-14T12:19:00.000Z	raonid	Milosh	and the model of your sound card?
2010-04-14T12:21:00.000Z	raonid	Milosh	well, you already started
2010-04-14T12:22:00.000Z	raonid	Milosh	it's the way to do it
2010-04-14T12:24:00.000Z	raonid	Milosh	well, I'm searching the web for something related...
2010-04-14T12:30:00.000Z	raonid	Milosh	have you seen this page? https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToSetupSoundCards
2010-04-14T12:34:00.000Z	raonid	Milosh	lspci is a command line program that tells you what hardware is in your pc box
2010-04-14T12:36:00.000Z	raonid	Milosh	don't know
2010-04-14T12:38:00.000Z	raonid	Milosh	ok
2010-04-14T12:39:00.000Z	raonid	Milosh	anyway you should confirm if snd-ens1731 is the module you need to your sound card
2010-04-14T12:39:00.000Z	raonid	Milosh	good luck
