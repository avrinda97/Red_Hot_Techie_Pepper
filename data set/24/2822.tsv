2009-09-06T03:52:00.000Z	vede		Okay, so, sudo invoke etc...
2009-09-06T03:52:00.000Z	vede		Just put my computer at a black screen that said "reloading log daemon" and never did anything.
2009-09-06T03:53:00.000Z	lstarnes	vede	did you try pressing enter?
2009-09-06T03:53:00.000Z	lstarnes	vede	what about ctrl+alt+f1
2009-09-06T03:53:00.000Z	lstarnes	vede	er, ctrl+alt+f2
2009-09-06T03:53:00.000Z	lstarnes	vede	when gdm is stopped it usually dumps you to a system console
2009-09-06T03:54:00.000Z	lstarnes	vede	they select the active system terminal
2009-09-06T03:54:00.000Z	lstarnes	vede	X normally is attached to the one accessed with ctrl+alt+f7
2009-09-06T03:55:00.000Z	lstarnes	vede	to go to the second terminal instead of the first
2009-09-06T03:55:00.000Z	lstarnes	vede	in case the first one doesn't work
2009-09-06T03:56:00.000Z	lstarnes	vede	I usually use the second, but the first usually works
2009-09-06T04:26:00.000Z	lstarnes	vede	it's usually on tty7 (ctrl+alt+f7)
2009-09-06T04:27:00.000Z	lstarnes	vede	ctrl+alt+f7
2009-09-06T04:27:00.000Z	lstarnes	vede	if X isn't running, that won't work
2009-09-06T04:34:00.000Z	lstarnes	vede	it sounds like it may be a configuration issue
2009-09-06T04:35:00.000Z	lstarnes	vede	were you installing video drivers earlier?
2009-09-06T04:36:00.000Z	lstarnes	vede	I think it could be the driver itself causing it
2009-09-06T04:36:00.000Z	lstarnes	vede	were you using ubuntu's driver manager?
2009-09-06T04:39:00.000Z	lstarnes	vede	have you tried the recovery mode?
2009-09-06T04:40:00.000Z	lstarnes	vede	that won't stop X.  It just changes to a different terminal
2009-09-06T04:42:00.000Z	lstarnes	vede	no
2009-09-06T04:43:00.000Z	lstarnes	vede	but it likely will work in revobery mode
2009-09-06T04:45:00.000Z	lstarnes	vede	if that fails, try sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
