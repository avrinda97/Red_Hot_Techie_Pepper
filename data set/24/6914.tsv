2005-06-17T11:12:00.000Z	nedwasp	ardob11	i have the same prob, it just hangs on starup, you?
2005-06-17T11:12:00.000Z	ardob11		exactly
2005-06-17T11:13:00.000Z	nedwasp	ardob11	i searched everywhere and couldn't find an answer.
2005-06-17T11:13:00.000Z	nedwasp		maybe here
2005-06-17T11:13:00.000Z	ardob11		i guess there is some other alternative with real codecs!?
2005-06-17T11:14:00.000Z	nedwasp	ardob11	i don't think so, i install helix, which works but doesn't run the real codecs
2005-06-17T11:14:00.000Z	nedwasp		what kind of computer you on?
2005-06-17T11:14:00.000Z	ardob11		ok thnx too bad

2005-06-17T11:17:00.000Z	nedwasp	ardob11	ok, completely different, i just was thinking that it's a rare error cause nobody else seems to have this problem
2005-06-17T11:17:00.000Z	nedwasp	ardob11	selfmade? nice
2005-06-17T11:18:00.000Z	ardob11		nothing special, but you tend to love your creation howerver it turns out
2005-06-17T11:19:00.000Z	nedwasp		of course, just like cooking a crappy meal.  do you know of a good way to remotely host an address book for access through an email client
2005-06-17T11:19:00.000Z	ardob11		nope
2005-06-17T11:19:00.000Z	nedwasp		ok then
2005-06-17T11:21:00.000Z	ardob11	nedwasp	why don't you try firebird help or something @ mozilla
2005-06-17T11:21:00.000Z	nedwasp		good call, but i can't seem to find the right channel
2005-06-17T11:21:00.000Z	nedwasp		is there a thunderbird channel you know of?
2005-06-17T11:22:00.000Z	nedwasp	ardob11	i found it
