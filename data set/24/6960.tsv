2005-06-01T16:47:00.000Z	crimsun	mrknisely	lsmod|grep ^snd_es19
2005-06-01T16:48:00.000Z	crimsun	mrknisely	pgrep esd
2005-06-01T16:49:00.000Z	crimsun	mrknisely	are you trying to use alsa specifically?
2005-06-01T16:49:00.000Z	crimsun	mrknisely	or would esound suffice?
2005-06-01T16:50:00.000Z	crimsun	mrknisely	System>Preferences>Sound
2005-06-01T16:50:00.000Z	crimsun	mrknisely	ensure that "Enable sound server startup" is checked
2005-06-01T16:50:00.000Z	crimsun	mrknisely	did you kill esd anytime before?
2005-06-01T16:50:00.000Z	crimsun	mrknisely	open a Terminal and execute esd
2005-06-01T16:54:00.000Z	crimsun	mrknisely	any luck?
2005-06-01T16:55:00.000Z	crimsun	mrknisely	no. First, System>Preferences>Multimedia Systems Selector>Default Audio Sink>ESD
2005-06-01T16:55:00.000Z	crimsun	mrknisely	second, start esd from a Terminal
2005-06-01T16:55:00.000Z	crimsun	mrknisely	sound should then work for all gstreamer-based apps
2005-06-01T16:57:00.000Z	crimsun	mrknisely	then execute esd in a Terminal
2005-06-01T16:59:00.000Z	mrknisely	crimsun	 Got a permission denied.
2005-06-01T05:00:00.000Z	crimsun	mrknisely	only if you run what as root?
2005-06-01T05:01:00.000Z	mrknisely	crimsun	 only if I run esd as root do I get tones.  If I run as myself I get permission denied message.
2005-06-01T05:02:00.000Z	crimsun	mrknisely	is your user in the audio group?
2005-06-01T05:03:00.000Z	mrknisely	crimsun	 Looks like nobody is a member of that group.
2005-06-01T05:04:00.000Z	crimsun	mrknisely	of audio? Well, you need to add your user to that group
2005-06-01T05:05:00.000Z	mrknisely	crimsun	 I am now added to that group.  Still get a permission denied when I try to run esd.
2005-06-01T05:05:00.000Z	crimsun	mrknisely	you need to log out and back in
2005-06-01T05:08:00.000Z	mrknisely	crimsun	  Worked great!!!  Thanks for all your help!
