2012-04-05T22:01:00.000Z	scarykitties		Does it require a working installation of Linux to work?
2012-04-05T22:01:00.000Z	scarykitties		There is no clicking or crashing, Dr.
2012-04-05T22:01:00.000Z	scarykitties		It's just not installing operating systems
2012-04-05T22:01:00.000Z	scarykitties		But that could be the DVD drive.
2012-04-05T22:02:00.000Z	scarykitties		The DVD drive isn't particularly responsive--barely notices me hitting the button to eject the DVD
2012-04-05T22:02:00.000Z	scarykitties		The error is an Input/Output error
2012-04-05T22:02:00.000Z	scarykitties		Yes, I am sure, Acid
2012-04-05T22:02:00.000Z	scarykitties		Let me try the live CD bit, then.
2012-04-05T22:04:00.000Z	scarykitties		The "try without installing" option doesn't work either
2012-04-05T22:04:00.000Z	scarykitties		Got the same I/O error
