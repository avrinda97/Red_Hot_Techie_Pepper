2007-01-23T16:09:00.000Z	DARKGuy		Has anybody looked into the bug of GAIM that sometimes it doesn't show the next text until you highlight the entire conversation window? or is it the Ubuntu build?
2007-01-23T16:09:00.000Z	xtknight	DARKGuy	odd, i dont have that issue

2007-01-23T16:10:00.000Z	DARKGuy	xtknight	right, found it. 2.0.0beta3.1 it says
2007-01-23T16:10:00.000Z	xtknight	DARKGuy	same here
2007-01-23T16:11:00.000Z	DARKGuy	xtknight	Well, it's weird o.o sometimes what friends say doesn't appear or appears cut, until I highlight the entire chat conversation or scroll down, sometimes I have to close the window and open it again because text goes invisible oO
2007-01-23T16:12:00.000Z	xtknight	DARKGuy	i sorta know what you're talking about.  text height seems to be a bit untuned at times.  i dunno i think it's happened to me once where it's been cut but it's never been invisible and i dont recall having the issue lately.
2007-01-23T16:13:00.000Z	DARKGuy	xtknight	yeah, sometimes :/ I've been thinking in rebuilding it from source to see... x)
2007-01-23T16:13:00.000Z	DARKGuy	xtknight	I need to go brb though xD, brb!
2007-03-29T06:02:00.000Z	xtknight	DARKGuy	gee that's odd, mine has 12 hour listed

2007-03-29T06:10:00.000Z	DARKGuy	xtknight	okay, apt-get remove --purge and then install again?
2007-03-29T06:10:00.000Z	xtknight	DARKGuy	sudo dpkg --purge --force-all gnome-panel && killall gnome-panel && sudo apt-get install gnome-panel && gnome-panel&
2007-03-29T06:11:00.000Z	xtknight	DARKGuy	i guess, so long as u dont care about losing some gnome panel things.  though i just did it a second ago and it kept my toolbar arrangements
