2007-06-12T16:05:00.000Z	siloko		hi guys, i'm having problems with sound since the last kernel upgrade, i have an intel based sound chip on my laptop motherboard - any clues how to start debugging this?
2007-06-12T16:06:00.000Z	crimsun	siloko	please read http://www.linux-sound.info/alsa/index.php?task=support and tell me the URL of the paste generated by the alsa-info.sh script linked from that page.
2007-06-12T16:06:00.000Z	siloko	crimsun	ok - two secs and i'll ber back
2007-06-12T16:09:00.000Z	siloko	crimsun	mmm i can't run that script i get a syntax error: bad substitution
2007-06-12T16:10:00.000Z	crimsun	siloko	prepend bash

2007-06-12T16:12:00.000Z	crimsun	siloko	looking.
2007-06-12T16:12:00.000Z	crimsun	siloko	your 'PCM' is muted and zeroed
2007-06-12T16:13:00.000Z	siloko	crimsun	and what does that mean :)
2007-06-12T16:13:00.000Z	crimsun	siloko	it means your sound volume is muted and set to zero.
2007-06-12T16:14:00.000Z	crimsun	siloko	do this in a Terminal: amixer set 'PCM' unmute && amixer set 'PCM' 80%
2007-06-12T16:14:00.000Z	siloko	crimsun	well that would explain no sound . . . but my master volume is set to 80 per cent and i have the control turned up
2007-06-12T16:14:00.000Z	crimsun	siloko	(or you may use the volume control/mixer applet in the upper right corner of the top panel)
2007-06-12T16:14:00.000Z	crimsun	siloko	on some devices, 'Master' and 'PCM' are completely separate.
2007-06-12T16:18:00.000Z	crimsun	siloko	status update?
2007-06-12T16:18:00.000Z	siloko		hey thats great thanks - i had to type 'sudo amixer set PCM on'
2007-06-12T16:18:00.000Z	siloko		and then  'sudo amixer set PCM 30'
2007-06-12T16:19:00.000Z	crimsun	siloko	it wouldn't work without sudo prepended?
2007-06-12T16:19:00.000Z	siloko	crimsun	and now all works (i didn' try without sudo)
2007-06-12T16:19:00.000Z	crimsun	siloko	you shouldn't need sudo for that, but ok.
2007-06-12T16:19:00.000Z	siloko	crimsun	but thanks for your help man :)
2007-06-12T16:19:00.000Z	crimsun	siloko	np
2007-06-12T16:20:00.000Z	siloko	crimsun	incidentally how would my PCM have got set to zero?
2007-06-12T16:21:00.000Z	crimsun	siloko	some applications mistakenly do it.
