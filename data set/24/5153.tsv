2006-10-10T08:25:00.000Z	O2		#include <iostream> using namespace std;  int main(){ cout<<"helloworld"<<endl;}
2006-10-10T08:25:00.000Z	O2		yes, that's the filename
2006-10-10T08:26:00.000Z	O2		ok, i try it.
2006-10-10T08:28:00.000Z	O2		sudo g++ helloworld.cpp,   an a.out file is produced.
2006-10-10T08:28:00.000Z	O2		why no need sudo?
2006-10-10T08:30:00.000Z	O2		I did, it return 0
2006-10-10T08:31:00.000Z	O2		it's in the current directory, no use to add ./ ?
2006-10-10T08:33:00.000Z	O2		the same!!
2006-10-10T08:33:00.000Z	O2		I add ./
2006-10-10T08:34:00.000Z	O2		I use dir and saw the helloworld file!
2006-10-10T08:34:00.000Z	chuckyp	O2	the file needs to be executable then you need to be in the directory that the file is in and they you type ./nameoffile  to run it.
2006-10-10T08:37:00.000Z	chuckyp	O2	g++ helloworld.cpp -o isuck  then hit return then you would type ./isuck to execute the program
2006-10-10T08:42:00.000Z	chuckyp	O2	the c support channel
2006-10-10T08:42:00.000Z	chuckyp	O2	/join ##C
2006-10-10T08:43:00.000Z	chuckyp	O2	dunno probably so it comes up earlier on a channel list or #c was taken dunno really
2006-10-10T08:53:00.000Z	chuckyp	O2	there are also gui environments to use for developing etc...  dunno what you are used to..
2006-10-10T09:25:00.000Z	chuckyp	O2	want to really read something type "man gcc" in console to read the manual pages for it.  Its pretty powerfull.
2006-10-10T09:33:00.000Z	chuckyp	O2	yeah
2006-10-10T09:33:00.000Z	chuckyp	O2	you can compare it to .bat but its much more powerfull.
2006-10-10T09:51:00.000Z	chuckyp	O2	read up the wiki on xgl pretty good step by step howto
2006-10-10T09:52:00.000Z	O2	chuckyp	could I get xgl by:   apt-get xgl?
2006-10-10T09:52:00.000Z	chuckyp	O2	its not quite that simple
2006-10-10T09:54:00.000Z	chuckyp	O2	yes
2006-10-10T09:54:00.000Z	chuckyp	O2	bash is essential.  basic linux commands will help you a lot.
