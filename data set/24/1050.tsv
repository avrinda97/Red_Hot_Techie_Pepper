2011-04-04T20:33:00.000Z	sukima		Why does apt-get rubygems say it is uptoday whena gem -v clearly shows an out of date version. Most gems need a newer version.
2011-04-04T20:34:00.000Z	maco	sukima	because it's up-to-date as of the ubuntu repositories
2011-04-04T20:34:00.000Z	maco	sukima	what is on your system is the newest in the repos. that's all apt-get can tell you
2011-04-04T20:34:00.000Z	sukima	maco	is there something wrong with it that ubuntu repositories are not being updated?
2011-04-04T20:34:00.000Z	maco	sukima	new versions of upstream software go into new versions of ubuntu. only bugs are fixed in stable ubuntu releases
2011-04-04T20:50:00.000Z	sukima	maco	I'll try that thanks
2011-04-04T20:35:00.000Z	maco	sukima	you could perhaps request a backport of the newer version for an older ubuntu release. there's a separate repository just for that
2011-04-04T20:36:00.000Z	sukima	maco	can up upgrade my ubuntu?
2011-04-04T20:36:00.000Z	sukima	maco	err can I upgrade my ubuntu release. I'm currently at 10.04
2011-04-04T20:39:00.000Z	maco	sukima	system -> admin -> software sources -> updates. set it to allow normal upgrades (instead of just long term support (LTS) releases), then open up update manager
2011-04-04T20:41:00.000Z	sukima	maco	thank you. How do you do that command line I'm running server
2011-04-04T20:41:00.000Z	maco	sukima	ah ok. just a second
2011-04-04T20:42:00.000Z	maco	sukima	/etc/update-manager/release-upgrades    <-- modify that file to "normal" instead of "lts"
2011-04-04T20:42:00.000Z	maco	sukima	then "sudo apt-get update && sudo do-release-upgrade"
2011-04-04T20:43:00.000Z	sukima	maco	thank you!!!!!
2011-04-04T20:47:00.000Z	sukima	maco	I'm sorry to bother again. it said no new release found
2011-04-04T20:48:00.000Z	maco	sukima	after changing it to normal and then doing apt-get update?
2011-04-04T20:49:00.000Z	sukima	maco	Sorry how do I change it to normal?
2011-04-04T20:49:00.000Z	maco	sukima	sudo vi ...that file i said...
2011-04-04T20:50:00.000Z	maco	sukima	big comment explains what different values for the variable mean, then at the end the variable is set to "lts" ...you need to change it to "normal"
2011-04-04T20:52:00.000Z	sukima	maco	that fixed it
2011-04-04T20:52:00.000Z	sukima	maco	thank you for dealing with my idiouscy
2011-04-04T20:52:00.000Z	maco	sukima	it's not idiocy, just inexperience. everybody has to ask for help first time through doing something new!
2011-04-04T20:54:00.000Z	sukima	maco	I'll be sure to pay that forward. thx again
