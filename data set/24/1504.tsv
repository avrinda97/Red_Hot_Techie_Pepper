2009-12-15T23:09:00.000Z	wvd		So, after 15 hours of trying to get my driver to work I need someone experienced.. If anyone wants to help me setting up my internet on linux that would be great. Some information here: http://bpaste.net/show/1424/ - but I have alot of extra information, infact I tried everything what was listed on guides for my adapter. Anyone could help? Thank you very much.
2009-12-15T23:09:00.000Z	kuttans	wvd	whats the problem you are facing
2009-12-15T23:10:00.000Z	wvd	kuttans	it doesn't work, no wlan0 interface, etc.
2009-12-15T23:11:00.000Z	kuttans	wvd	you want to use wlan or ethernet? and whats the make of your computer
2009-12-15T23:12:00.000Z	wvd	kuttans	wlan, 'make of', what do you mean?
2009-12-15T23:12:00.000Z	kuttans	wvd	who manufactured your hard ware
2009-12-15T23:12:00.000Z	kuttans	wvd	get the terminal and type ifconfig
2009-12-15T23:13:00.000Z	wvd	kuttans	read the pastebin.. ifconfig only shows eth/lo
2009-12-15T23:13:00.000Z	wvd	kuttans	ok, let me reboot and get it, then i'll pastebin it.
2009-12-15T23:19:00.000Z	wvd	kuttans	ifconfig -a showed the same as ifconfig.. note that I got an USB adapter.
2009-12-15T23:20:00.000Z	wvd	kuttans	it's not built in.. lsusb lists my adapter.. ifconfig -a: http://bpaste.net/show/1427/
2009-12-15T23:21:00.000Z	kuttans	wvd	just hold on a second
2009-12-15T23:22:00.000Z	kuttans	wvd	seems your wlan adapter is not identified at all
2009-12-15T23:23:00.000Z	kuttans	wvd	ist a usb adapter?
2009-12-15T23:23:00.000Z	wvd	kuttans	yes, it's an adapter plugged into the usb-port (siemens gigaset usb adapter 108)
2009-12-15T23:23:00.000Z	wvd	kuttans	it works fine on windows
2009-12-15T23:25:00.000Z	kuttans	wvd	i will have to check then....bcoz i forget most of the commands....and in the mean while checkout whether anyone else is able to help you and try to get in touch with the hw guys to help you out
2009-12-15T23:26:00.000Z	wvd	kuttans	ok, well, i'm trying it for ~15h so I tried *almost* everything, lsusb seems to show the chipset id fine (129b:160c)
2009-12-15T23:27:00.000Z	kuttans	wvd	the one i have is also a usb but it is inbuilt. so i never faced a problem like yours.. i will try to get a solution and post it in the forums
2009-12-15T23:28:00.000Z	wvd	kuttans	I think it's a hardware problem, which forums? I'd also like to post my errors and such
2009-12-15T23:30:00.000Z	wvd	kuttans	i'll post it @ ubuntuforums.org under Networking & Wireless.
2009-12-15T23:30:00.000Z	kuttans	wvd	ok i will check out and reply as soon as possible
2009-12-15T23:31:00.000Z	wvd	kuttans	thanks
