2010-02-03T06:49:00.000Z	myshirwm		Hi, could someone help me? I have googled the heck out of this problem with no avail.
2010-02-03T06:49:00.000Z	myshirwm		I'm trying to mount an .iso and every time I try, I get this error: "An error occured
2010-02-03T06:49:00.000Z	myshirwm		 wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/loop0,       missing codepage or helper program, or other error
2010-02-03T06:49:00.000Z	myshirwm		       In some cases useful info is found in syslog - try
2010-02-03T06:50:00.000Z	myshirwm		       dmesg | tail  or so" Doesn't matter if I use gmount-iso or the mount command.
2010-02-03T06:50:00.000Z	myshirwm		Sorry
2010-02-03T06:52:00.000Z	myshirwm		Does anyone have any ideas about my iso problem?
2010-02-03T06:54:00.000Z	myshirwm		any suggestions for mounting an iso that returns an error?

2010-02-03T06:57:00.000Z	myshirwm	rahduke	I'm trying to mount an iso, not an HD

2010-02-03T06:59:00.000Z	rahduke	myshirwm	its prolly a busted ISO, i assume u downloaded it right?
2010-02-03T06:59:00.000Z	myshirwm	rahduke	yes but all the reviews on the download site said it works
2010-02-03T07:00:00.000Z	myshirwm	rahduke	I tried that, I don't have a directory called /dev/loop/o
2010-02-03T07:02:00.000Z	rahduke	myshirwm	sorry, i thought u were talking about a HDD
