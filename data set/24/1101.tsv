2011-11-10T11:05:00.000Z	{bosco}		ok so i have disabled root acess to my server via ssh but my other user now has acess to root what now?
2011-11-10T11:05:00.000Z	tensorpudding	{bosco}	what do you mean, your other user now has access to root?
2011-11-10T11:06:00.000Z	tensorpudding	{bosco}	users in the admin group will always be able to sudo unless you configure it otherwise
2011-11-10T11:07:00.000Z	{bosco}	tensorpudding	i know this i have disabled ssh to root and now bosco has access to root what are the benifets to that other than it is being logged when he uses it ?
2011-11-10T11:07:00.000Z	tensorpudding	{bosco}	what is the benefit to what?
2011-11-10T11:08:00.000Z	{bosco}	tensorpudding	disabling root login via ssh and making bosco have root access>
2011-11-10T11:08:00.000Z	tensorpudding	{bosco}	the advantage is that bots that hammer your ssh server trying to log in as root will always fail
2011-11-10T11:08:00.000Z	tensorpudding	{bosco}	but it doesn't matter since root is locked from direct login by default in ubuntu
2011-11-10T11:09:00.000Z	{bosco}	tensorpudding	not on ubuntu server
2011-11-10T11:09:00.000Z	tensorpudding		they'd have to guess your username bosco, and then guess your password
2011-11-10T11:09:00.000Z	{bosco}		right
2011-11-10T11:09:00.000Z	{bosco}		ok
2011-11-10T11:09:00.000Z	{bosco}		ust cant think this late for some reason lol tensorpudding any other reason
2011-11-10T11:11:00.000Z	{bosco}		then why not just change the port that root logs into on tensorpudding or is port scanning to easy for a bot to get by?
2011-11-10T11:11:00.000Z	tensorpudding	{bosco}	you can't have ssh listen on multiple ports
2011-11-10T11:11:00.000Z	tensorpudding		and anyway i don't think it matters
2011-11-10T11:12:00.000Z	{bosco}	tensorpudding	i know this but i can chnage the port default from 22 to ssh -p (whatever port i want to) @myserver.com
2011-11-10T11:12:00.000Z	{bosco}		within sshd_config
2011-11-10T11:12:00.000Z	tensorpudding		yes
2011-11-10T11:12:00.000Z	tensorpudding		you can change the port, for the whole thing
2011-11-10T11:12:00.000Z	tensorpudding		i don't think it'll really help
2011-11-10T11:13:00.000Z	tensorpudding		it'd still be visible from a scan on all ports
2011-11-10T11:13:00.000Z	tensorpudding		assuming your firewall isn't blocking it
2011-11-10T11:13:00.000Z	{bosco}	tensorpudding	im not a hacker so i am just trying to understand this it is 2 easy for them to figure out that i have changed it and what port it is ( i also use bastille)
