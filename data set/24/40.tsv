2012-10-13T01:33:00.000Z	kulitorum		I added modes "1280x1024" to my xorg.conf, but I still can only select 640x480 in displays. How can I force higher resolution? (there's no resolutions listed under "Monitor" should there be?)
2012-10-13T01:34:00.000Z	kulitorum		xrandr lists 640x480 and 320x240
2012-10-13T01:34:00.000Z	kulitorum		Quadro 4600
2012-10-13T01:34:00.000Z	kulitorum		..or maybe 4700
2012-10-13T01:35:00.000Z	kulitorum		It worked fine on another 1920x1200 monitor, but this one is connected with a 15pin d-sub
2012-10-13T01:35:00.000Z	kulitorum		 NVIDIA Corporation G80 [Quadro FX 4600] (rev a2)
2012-10-13T01:35:00.000Z	kulitorum		so I guess there's no data communication
2012-10-13T01:35:00.000Z	TJ-	kulitorum	If you are using the nvidia proprietary driver, you'll need to use the "Nvidia X Server Settings" application
2012-10-13T01:36:00.000Z	TJ-	kulitorum	Check "/var/log/Xorg.0.log" see if the driver is getting a valid EDID from the monitor?
2012-10-13T01:36:00.000Z	TJ-	kulitorum	In the "Screen" section - in the "Monitor" section you put the Horizontal/Vertical refresh frequencies
2012-10-13T01:37:00.000Z	kulitorum	TJ-	Check, that's there. Looks resonable
2012-10-13T01:37:00.000Z	TJ-	kulitorum	The frequencies allow the driver to check that that the monitor can accept any modes that are selected
2012-10-13T01:42:00.000Z	TJ-	kulitorum	There are webpages that can generate the correct modes for the Screen section of xorg.conf if you give them the frequency-range of the monitor.
2012-10-13T01:42:00.000Z	TJ-	kulitorum	But first, I'd suggest you search for that monitor's correct frequency range!
2012-10-13T01:43:00.000Z	TJ-	kulitorum	I'd expect to be seeing something like "HorizSync 30.000-81.00"
2012-10-13T01:44:00.000Z	TJ-	kulitorum	With the range you reported, it would only be able to do 800x600 max I'd guess
2012-10-13T01:44:00.000Z	TJ-	kulitorum	I'm not sure off top of my head, but as I said, there are web-pages that can generate this stuff for you. Give them frequencies, they give you modes. Give them modes (or max resolutions) and they'll give you frequencies
2012-10-13T01:52:00.000Z	kulitorum	TJ-	It works now. Changing  HorizSync to 30.000-81.00 and everything works as expected. Thanks :)
2012-10-13T01:58:00.000Z	TJ-	kulitorum	What group owns that device node ("ls -l /dev/ttyUSB0") ?
2012-10-13T01:59:00.000Z	TJ-	kulitorum	Usually, you'd add the user that needs to access the USB serial port to the group that owns the device node
2012-10-13T01:59:00.000Z	TJ-	kulitorum	Often it's the "dialup" group
2012-10-13T01:59:00.000Z	TJ-	kulitorum	sorry, "dialout" group
2012-10-13T02:00:00.000Z	TJ-	kulitorum	"sudo adduser $USER dailout" ... you'll need to log-out and log-in for the new group to take effect though
2012-10-13T02:01:00.000Z	TJ-	kulitorum	oops, typo! "sudo adduser $USER dialout" !!
