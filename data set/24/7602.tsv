2005-08-02T08:10:00.000Z	scythe		with what shade?
2005-08-02T08:11:00.000Z	scythe		can you do a remote mount  (something like mount -f ntfs 192.168.0.1/hda1 /media/winblowsshare)??
2005-08-02T08:13:00.000Z	scythe		dang you bob2, you type to quick
2005-08-02T08:14:00.000Z	scythe		brad, you might want to look at wifi radar
2005-08-02T08:14:00.000Z	scythe		just google for it
2005-08-02T08:15:00.000Z	scythe		i think id rather have the ram issues
2005-08-02T08:16:00.000Z	scythe		anyone know if you can remote mount a partition over a network without using nfs like you can in solaris?
2005-08-02T08:16:00.000Z	bob2	scythe	you mean mounting a raw device?
2005-08-02T08:17:00.000Z	bob2	scythe	then how on earth do you want to access it?
2005-08-02T08:19:00.000Z	bob2	scythe	you can use network block devices, but why?
2005-08-02T08:21:00.000Z	bob2	scythe	normally you'd just mount it and export it over nfs or coda or smb or ...
2005-08-02T08:21:00.000Z	bob2	scythe	if you run the network block device daemon on both, it should work
2005-08-02T08:31:00.000Z	bob2	scythe	module = driver
2005-08-02T08:32:00.000Z	bob2	scythe	no
2005-08-02T08:32:00.000Z	bob2	scythe	the kernel thread thing is something entirely different
2005-08-02T08:34:00.000Z	bob2	scythe	a kernel module is a driver that gets loaded into the kernel, and can then run. it can be loaded manually with modprobe, or automatically at boot by hotplug.  some of them, like the irda one, run a kernel thread, which is just a little program in the kernel
2005-08-02T08:34:00.000Z	bob2	scythe	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FixVideoResolutionHowto
2005-08-02T08:35:00.000Z	bob2	scythe	and don't forget to file a bug, ubuntu should have foun dit specifically
2005-08-02T08:43:00.000Z	bob2	scythe	october
