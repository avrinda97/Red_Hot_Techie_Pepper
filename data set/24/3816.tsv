2008-01-01T10:24:00.000Z	Smegzor		I like Vista.  It looks nice running in its little cage on my desktop.  There's no door or feeding tray in its cage, but I wouldn't want to actually USE it.
2008-01-01T10:25:00.000Z	WorkingOnWise	Smegzor	hehehe..I run WinXP now the same way... I so love vm's!
2008-01-01T10:26:00.000Z	Smegzor	WorkingOnWise	me too.  Thats the only way I run XP now.  My base is Ubuntu 64 with 4 gigs and dual core.
2008-01-01T10:27:00.000Z	WorkingOnWise	Smegzor	I tride AMD64 Ubuntu for about a month. So many little things not right yet, and no real performance boost I saw, I am on x32 now....
2008-01-01T10:32:00.000Z	Smegzor	WorkingOnWise	I got an intel and the performance boost is huge compared to my old pc that ran XP.  My virtual XP is called Squeaky Toy (inspired by Monkey Boy).
2008-01-01T10:34:00.000Z	WorkingOnWise	Smegzor	LOL!! From xp to Ubuntu, major performance boost! from Ubuntu x32 to x64, nothing that I could really tell... xp is almost as fast in its sandbox as it was whenit had the whole pc to itself!
2008-01-01T10:35:00.000Z	Smegzor	WorkingOnWise	My XP is lots faster viirtually than real.  No way I'm going back.
2008-01-01T10:35:00.000Z	WorkingOnWise	Smegzor	faster virtual? how do u do that!
2008-01-01T10:37:00.000Z	Smegzor	WorkingOnWise	not difficult. the old XP was installed ages ago and despite careful management, takes 5 minutes to boot and the same to shut down.  You know how it starts off slow and gets slower over time? ^^
2008-01-01T10:38:00.000Z	Smegzor	WorkingOnWise	also I save the machine state and reboot rarely.
2008-01-01T10:39:00.000Z	WorkingOnWise	Smegzor	ah..1 year is the longest I ever went with any flavor of windows except NT 4.0. Went 3 years and finally upgraded to Win 2000. Never did reinstall NT. They were headed the right direction with that,...
2008-01-01T10:40:00.000Z	WorkingOnWise	Smegzor	doer the bootup from the machins stats save time? I imagined it was like hibernation.
2008-01-01T10:40:00.000Z	Smegzor	WorkingOnWise	yeah lots of time
2008-01-01T10:41:00.000Z	WorkingOnWise	Smegzor	hmmm...I'll have to play more with it then.
2008-01-01T10:46:00.000Z	Smegzor	WorkingOnWise	I purchased an MSDN license for $2,500.  Wasn't that nice of me? :O
2008-01-01T10:46:00.000Z	WorkingOnWise	Smegzor	ouch!
2008-01-01T10:47:00.000Z	WorkingOnWise	Smegzor	they make it so easy....who can blame us?
2008-01-01T10:48:00.000Z	WorkingOnWise	Smegzor	do u do much with MS c++?
2008-01-01T10:49:00.000Z	WorkingOnWise	Smegzor	did your license include Exchange 200(whateveris newest)?
2008-01-01T10:51:00.000Z	WorkingOnWise	Smegzor	hehe...I liked 5.5. Saw 2000 and hated it. Now with google mail and cal, who needs it at all? But I like to compare the FOSS offerings to the commercial stuff. Nice to see the progress of the FOSS stuff while the commercial stuff gets service pack after service pack 
2008-01-01T10:52:00.000Z	WorkingOnWise	Smegzor	hehehe never thought of it like that...hehehe
2008-01-01T10:57:00.000Z	WorkingOnWise	Smegzor	we can thank pressure from ff growth for that....
2008-01-01T11:01:00.000Z	WorkingOnWise	Smegzor	akaik, wine is very sandboxed.
2008-01-01T11:03:00.000Z	WorkingOnWise	Smegzor	many app (vbox fir example) run at least part of itself as a user, and then a process owned by that user.
