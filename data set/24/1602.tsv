2010-03-03T19:42:00.000Z	dabaR	impi_	I can try to help you with the issue.
2010-03-03T19:42:00.000Z	dabaR	impi_	What are you trying to achieve?
2010-03-03T19:45:00.000Z	impi_	dabaR	i am using GD and php5 - at first GD dont work with my script because I cant use: imagelayereffect() - as noted here: http://php.net/manual/en/function.imagelayereffect.php - it explaines that i should compile GD into php - I then followed this steps: http://www.howtoforge.com/recompiling-php5-with-bundled-support-for-gd-on-ubuntu - but this breaks with this error: Patch suhosin.patch does not remove cleanly (refresh it or enforce with -f) which bring
2010-03-03T19:46:00.000Z	dabaR	impi_	so that function is not available in the php5-gd package that comes with Ubuntu?
2010-03-03T19:46:00.000Z	impi_	dabaR	no :(
2010-03-03T19:47:00.000Z	dabaR	impi_	is the code private, or can you post it? The code that can not run with the stock ubuntu package...
2010-03-03T19:48:00.000Z	dabaR	impi_	or can I just take the example from  php.net?
2010-03-03T19:48:00.000Z	dabaR	impi_	OK, I get the error with the example.
2010-03-03T19:49:00.000Z	impi_	dabaR	its actually quite simple. i want to use reflection on a png image
2010-03-03T19:50:00.000Z	dabaR	impi_	But to define the test case that meets the need, as soon as you can run the imagelayereffect function, the problem is solved, right?
2010-03-03T19:50:00.000Z	impi_	dabaR	yes, but for that i must get php compiled
2010-03-03T19:51:00.000Z	dabaR	impi_	OK, so you removed your installed PHP, right?
2010-03-03T19:51:00.000Z	impi_	dabaR	yes i did
2010-03-03T19:52:00.000Z	dabaR	impi_	using what command?
2010-03-03T19:53:00.000Z	impi_	dabaR	i see in my src folder debian/patches/suhosi patch i - removed that - and now will do configure again
