2012-09-09T21:08:00.000Z	ikonia	ubuntucrazy	has your screen ever worked ? or did it never work ?
2012-09-09T21:09:00.000Z	ubuntucrazy	ikonia	yes my desktop worked before i upgraded
2012-09-09T21:09:00.000Z	ikonia	ubuntucrazy	ok, so it's the upgrade that broke it
2012-09-09T21:10:00.000Z	ikonia	ubuntucrazy	what video card do you have ?
2012-09-09T21:10:00.000Z	ubuntucrazy	ikonia	matrox
2012-09-09T21:10:00.000Z	ikonia	ubuntucrazy	ok, so an ATI
2012-09-09T21:10:00.000Z	ikonia	ubuntucrazy	the upgrade was from 11.10 to 12.04 ? or some other version
2012-09-09T21:11:00.000Z	ubuntucrazy	ikonia	yes from 11.10 to 12.04
2012-09-09T21:11:00.000Z	ikonia	ubuntucrazy	can you be specific about the card make/model
2012-09-09T21:18:00.000Z	ubuntucrazy	ikonia	my graphics cardi is Matrox Graphics 32MB
2012-09-09T21:19:00.000Z	ikonia	ubuntucrazy	ok,
2012-09-09T21:19:00.000Z	ikonia	ubuntucrazy	do you know how to boot into recovery mode ?
2012-09-09T21:21:00.000Z	ubuntucrazy	ikonia	how do i boot in recovery mode?
2012-09-09T21:21:00.000Z	ikonia	ubuntucrazy	you should have a recovery option on your grub menu
2012-09-09T21:23:00.000Z	ubuntucrazy	ikonia	yes. i did use all the recovery mode options at the grub menu but still the same
2012-09-09T21:23:00.000Z	ikonia	ubuntucrazy	really, you still get that if you hit the recovery shell option
2012-09-09T21:28:00.000Z	ubuntucrazy	ikonia	yes. all the options still the same
2012-09-09T21:28:00.000Z	ikonia	ubuntucrazy	ok, so we know it's the framebuffer rather than X that's the issue in this situation
2012-09-09T21:32:00.000Z	ubuntucrazy	ikonia	what to do if it's the framebuffer that causes the issue? any steps?
2012-09-09T22:06:00.000Z	ikonia	ubuntucrazy	sorry, I was just dealing with something else, how are you progressing ?
