2005-10-14T13:48:00.000Z	hoodman		I have a few questions about software for ubuntu, can i ask in this chan?
2005-10-14T13:49:00.000Z	hoodman		ok, i have never used anything but windows, and am sort of limping along...im looking for a secure ftp server, and a good antivirus
2005-10-14T13:50:00.000Z	DavidLeeRoth	hoodman	is the hdd vtfs?
2005-10-14T13:50:00.000Z	DavidLeeRoth		* i meand NTFS
2005-10-14T13:51:00.000Z	hoodman	DavidLeeRoth	i dont know vtfs?
2005-10-14T13:51:00.000Z	hoodman		oh...lol
2005-10-14T13:51:00.000Z	hoodman		yes ntfs
2005-10-14T13:51:00.000Z	DavidLeeRoth		ntfs lol
2005-10-14T13:51:00.000Z	DavidLeeRoth		support for write access is a bit shaky
2005-10-14T13:51:00.000Z	DavidLeeRoth		i wouldnt try to risk your win data
2005-10-14T13:52:00.000Z	DavidLeeRoth		instead, why dont you try to partition your drives and make a fat32 part so you can exchange files between the two?
2005-10-14T13:52:00.000Z	hoodman	DavidLeeRoth	that would be fine...imless concerned about the anti virus, and more concerned about finding a ftp program
2005-10-14T13:52:00.000Z	DavidLeeRoth		or, you can use vmware, virtually boot into your windows partition from linux, and you can use that to download files to your hdd
2005-10-14T13:53:00.000Z	DavidLeeRoth		 hoodman you could also set up a "virtual network" using vmware
2005-10-14T13:53:00.000Z	DavidLeeRoth		that gets rid of any file system conflicts
2005-10-14T13:54:00.000Z	DavidLeeRoth		and as for secure ftp, use SSH lol
2005-10-14T13:54:00.000Z	hoodman		well, here is what its for....im running a computer that runs my ftp, and to use a program called emule
2005-10-14T13:54:00.000Z	DavidLeeRoth	hoodman	emule has a linux port
2005-10-14T13:54:00.000Z	hoodman	DavidLeeRoth	what is ssh?
2005-10-14T13:54:00.000Z	DavidLeeRoth	hoodman	ssh is secure shell
2005-10-14T13:55:00.000Z	DavidLeeRoth		apt-cache search ssh
2005-10-14T13:55:00.000Z	DavidLeeRoth		i used to be like you.  i was a bit scared of a win32-linux migration, but now i havent turned back
2005-10-14T13:55:00.000Z	hoodman	DavidLeeRoth	is that a peice of software, or something internally in ubuntu?
2005-10-14T13:56:00.000Z	hoodman	DavidLeeRoth	well i put it on my laptop that i use for websurfing, and it runs so much better
