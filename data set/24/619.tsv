2011-04-25T03:49:00.000Z	rich542		Hi, I'm trying to install ubuntu via boot from usb pendrive. It copied the files okay, when I boot it gets as far as saying Isolinux, then restarts to the boot splash. Anyone know what could be wrong? I've tried using testdisk in windows, which shows the drive as having 4 bootable partitions.
2011-04-25T03:50:00.000Z	chelz	rich542	try unetbootin
2011-04-25T03:58:00.000Z	chelz	rich542	unetbootin
2011-04-25T04:00:00.000Z	chelz	rich542	use unetbootin
2011-04-25T04:01:00.000Z	rich542	chelz	why is changing the program used to install a boot loader going to fix the partition structure of the usb disk? I don't see the connection.
2011-04-25T04:01:00.000Z	chelz	rich542	oh. right. you should format that usb thing to just fat32.
2011-04-25T04:01:00.000Z	chelz	rich542	i forgot unetbootin doesn't do partitioning
2011-04-25T04:02:00.000Z	rich542	chelz	It is fat32 now
2011-04-25T04:02:00.000Z	chelz	rich542	but just one or a few?
2011-04-25T04:04:00.000Z	rich542	chelz	I get from testdisk: bad relative sector, bad starting sector, bad ending sector (chs and lba don't match) only one partition must be bootable.
2011-04-25T04:05:00.000Z	chelz	rich542	do you have anything you want to keep on that usb drive?
2011-04-25T04:05:00.000Z	rich542	chelz	no.
2011-04-25T04:05:00.000Z	chelz	rich542	are you currently in windows?
2011-04-25T04:05:00.000Z	rich542	chelz	yes
2011-04-25T04:11:00.000Z	rich542	chelz	Is there something i can do in testdisk to fix the drive?
2011-04-25T04:11:00.000Z	chelz	rich542	the drive is fine, just have to repartition it.
2011-04-25T04:12:00.000Z	chelz	rich542	xp, vista or 7?
2011-04-25T04:12:00.000Z	rich542	chelz	7

2011-04-25T04:13:00.000Z	chelz	rich542	do that but select the usb drive and just make it so there's one big fat32 partition
2011-04-25T04:14:00.000Z	rich542	chelz	I already did that it appears in windows as 1 fat32 primary partition. in testdisk however it shows 4 different type partitions.
2011-04-25T04:15:00.000Z	chelz	rich542	testdisk is designed to look for deleted stuff, so that might be fine. in windows does it have a free space amount that is about the same as the size of the usb drive?
2011-04-25T04:16:00.000Z	rich542	chelz	it shows 14.8 gb for a 16gb device.
2011-04-25T04:18:00.000Z	chelz	rich542	close enough. unetbootin will work with that fine
