2008-04-24T05:32:00.000Z	bazhang	XFLXFLXFL	need more info; what exact errors, what steps failed etc
2008-04-24T05:34:00.000Z	bazhang	XFLXFLXFL	uh you are on here; why not get it and transfer it over via usbkey?
2008-04-24T05:39:00.000Z	bazhang	XFLXFLXFL	what is the chipset, nevermind the brand name
2008-04-24T05:40:00.000Z	bazhang	XFLXFLXFL	you talking to me? use my nick (type baz then hit tab) and I can follow more easily
2008-04-24T05:40:00.000Z	XFLXFLXFL	bazhang	Yes
2008-04-24T05:41:00.000Z	XFLXFLXFL	bazhang	Where do I find out the chipset?
2008-04-24T05:41:00.000Z	bazhang	XFLXFLXFL	what does lspci show (if pci card)
2008-04-24T05:42:00.000Z	XFLXFLXFL	bazhang	Doesnt list it.. shows everything but my linksys card
2008-04-24T05:43:00.000Z	bazhang	XFLXFLXFL	what about lsusb for a usb card then
2008-04-24T05:43:00.000Z	XFLXFLXFL	bazhang	what do you mean a usbcard?
2008-04-24T05:43:00.000Z	bazhang	XFLXFLXFL	external usb plug in thing
2008-04-24T05:44:00.000Z	XFLXFLXFL	bazhang	that mean I gota go buy somthing else? lol.. I just got this card like 2 months ago lol
2008-04-24T05:44:00.000Z	XFLXFLXFL	bazhang	I think I might need to go back to windows lol
2008-04-24T05:44:00.000Z	bazhang	XFLXFLXFL	your choice really
2008-04-24T05:45:00.000Z	XFLXFLXFL	bazhang	I want to use ubuntu but I only have an option for wireless internet
2008-04-24T05:45:00.000Z	XFLXFLXFL	bazhang	lsusb shows nothing
2008-04-24T05:46:00.000Z	bazhang	XFLXFLXFL	well you need to give us the chipset before we can proceed; mentioning going back to windows is not a motivator for people *volunteering* to help you
2008-04-24T05:46:00.000Z	XFLXFLXFL	bazhang	well how else may I look up the chipset?
2008-04-24T05:46:00.000Z	bazhang	XFLXFLXFL	please paste output of ifconfig and lspci to pastebin
2008-04-24T05:50:00.000Z	bazhang	XFLXFLXFL	that is a pcmcia card? best not to hotplug those--could damage your motherboard
