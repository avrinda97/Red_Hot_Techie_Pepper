2011-10-19T09:06:00.000Z	JusticeZero		Dunno, i'm willing to take the chance though. Mind you, i'm more and more likely to actively disable my security etc. updates after this.
2011-10-19T09:08:00.000Z	JusticeZero		software isn't botany
2011-10-19T09:09:00.000Z	JusticeZero		genetic fallacy
2011-10-19T09:10:00.000Z	JusticeZero		Is there a way to find out what packages were updated?
2011-10-19T09:11:00.000Z	computer_	JusticeZero	sure just go to the Ubuntu Software Center and click on the "History" option
2011-10-19T09:29:00.000Z	computer_	JusticeZero	/var/log/apt contains a history of package installations
2011-10-19T09:31:00.000Z	computer_	JusticeZero	can you start X at all?
2011-10-19T09:34:00.000Z	computer_	JusticeZero	so you can run synaptic from the bash?
2011-10-19T09:36:00.000Z	computer_	JusticeZero	okay so you have GUI, got it
2011-10-19T09:37:00.000Z	computer_	JusticeZero	well in that case run synaptic package manager and go to "File->History"
2011-10-19T09:39:00.000Z	computer_	JusticeZero	 When do you do the updates?
2011-10-19T09:41:00.000Z	computer_	JusticeZero	cool but when was the last time you run the update
2011-10-19T09:47:00.000Z	computer_	JusticeZero	I say this because if you know the date you updated when things got all broken you can uninstall all things installed on the date
2011-10-19T09:49:00.000Z	computer_	JusticeZero	and then if you are really keen you can run the update manager once again only this time install them one at a time and check each time if wine brakes
2011-10-19T09:51:00.000Z	computer_	JusticeZero	what kind of errors?
2011-10-19T09:56:00.000Z	computer_	JusticeZero	what happens when you ping a target?
2011-10-19T09:59:00.000Z	computer_	JusticeZero	I would type "sudo apt-get remove --purge 'package' -f
2011-10-19T10:03:00.000Z	computer_	JusticeZero	Harro dare
2011-10-19T10:16:00.000Z	computer_	JusticeZero	ooo, 4% packet loss is not so happy fun time
2011-10-19T10:17:00.000Z	computer_	JusticeZero	still it could be worse
2011-10-19T10:18:00.000Z	computer_	JusticeZero	have you done a trace route to see what is going on?
2011-10-19T10:21:00.000Z	computer_	JusticeZero	first you need to install traceroute
2011-10-19T10:21:00.000Z	computer_	JusticeZero	sudo apt-get install traceroute
2011-10-19T10:26:00.000Z	computer_	JusticeZero	that was a good time to use the /me command
