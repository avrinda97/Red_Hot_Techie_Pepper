2012-09-06T11:39:00.000Z	hlpme		followed by a reboot, usr13?
2012-09-06T11:40:00.000Z	hlpme		got it... should I run it before rebotting?
2012-09-06T11:41:00.000Z	user_	hlpme	you never need to reboot
2012-09-06T11:41:00.000Z	user_		you can just reboot X if you want, with right alt + printscreen + K
2012-09-06T11:41:00.000Z	hlpme		I come from windows hehehe
2012-09-06T11:44:00.000Z	user_		you'll need to wait for ubuntu 14.04 for such complex features
2012-09-06T11:44:00.000Z	user_		(no idea in truth)
2012-09-06T11:44:00.000Z	hlpme		I restarted but I still have the same problem
2012-09-06T11:44:00.000Z	hlpme		how do I run the compiz cfg mgr?
2012-09-06T11:45:00.000Z	hlpme		it is normal for it to say unity-panel-service: no process found
2012-09-06T11:46:00.000Z	hlpme		unity --reset went all hte way for the first time. I guess I should try restarting. what was the command to do that without rebooting?
2012-09-06T11:48:00.000Z	hlpme		I did get some glib and gconf warnings though. Gconf-critical: gconf-client_add_dir: assertion 'gconf_valid_key (dirname, NULL)' failed
2012-09-06T11:49:00.000Z	hlpme	usr13	yes, similar to that I think, but I'll have to take a closer look to be sure
2012-09-06T11:52:00.000Z	hlpme		I did run apt-get update
2012-09-06T11:53:00.000Z	hlpme		I'll try upgrade too
2012-09-06T11:54:00.000Z	hlpme		how can I run ccsm; it complains about not having a display. I can't launch from the GUI. or at least I don't know how
2012-09-06T11:54:00.000Z	hlpme		upgrade didn't do anything.
2012-09-06T11:56:00.000Z	hlpme	usr13	it's at loading icons. am I supposed to switch to GUI with alt-f7 to see something? because I get a blank screen and a mouse cursor when I do that
2012-09-06T11:58:00.000Z	hlpme		yes, it did
2012-09-06T12:00:00.000Z	hlpme		I rebooted but I still have a purple Dash and an empty title bar
2012-09-06T12:02:00.000Z	hlpme		I think unity is installed or loading improperly; there is no workspace manager or whatever it's called
2012-09-06T12:02:00.000Z	hlpme		I can run ccsm from the terminal but then I can't get back to the GUI to see it because I get a blank screen
2012-09-06T12:03:00.000Z	hlpme		ctrl-alt-t does not do anything; only ctrl-alt-fX does
2012-09-06T12:04:00.000Z	user_	hlpme	install xfce :p
