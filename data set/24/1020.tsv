2011-01-01T02:30:00.000Z	kholzer	FalseLobster	What are you trying to do?
2011-01-01T02:30:00.000Z	kholzer	FalseLobster	It should be straightforward to make a bootable USB stick.
2011-01-01T02:33:00.000Z	FalseLobster	kholzer	SHOULD be.  I've spent hours on this project, gave up, and am returning to it now because I have more free time.
2011-01-01T02:35:00.000Z	kholzer	FalseLobster	what OS are you trying to install it from?
2011-01-01T02:36:00.000Z	FalseLobster	kholzer	Currently? Windows.  Although I'm sure I could just as easily make a live CD and do it from Ubuntu if I needed to.
2011-01-01T02:37:00.000Z	kholzer	FalseLobster	Give me a second
2011-01-01T02:40:00.000Z	FalseLobster	kholzer	Here's a forum post describing exactly what I'm trying to do http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1656996
2011-01-01T02:41:00.000Z	kholzer	FalseLobster	Why NTFS instead of FAT?  Is there a size limitation or something on FAT32?  (I seem to remember something along these lines...)
2011-01-01T02:42:00.000Z	kholzer	FalseLobster	NTFS is superior (journaled, etc), but FAT is omnipresent...
2011-01-01T02:43:00.000Z	FalseLobster	kholzer	FAT32 has a max file size of 4GB.  I actually had it working already using one of those utilities and FAT32, but then I had a DVD iso I was trying to get from  someone else and realized I couldn't copy the file.
2011-01-01T02:43:00.000Z	kholzer	FalseLobster	Lameness.  There are filesplitters/joiners you can use to deal with that...
2011-01-01T02:44:00.000Z	kholzer	FalseLobster	There shoudl be no problem getting what you want though.
2011-01-01T02:45:00.000Z	kholzer	FalseLobster	*should.  You can partition it however you want.  NTFS will work as a secondary partition.  Note, however, that it won't connect to OS X boxes out of the box (need to install NTFS 3G's FUSE Mac Driver first).
2011-01-01T02:45:00.000Z	kholzer	FalseLobster	You can definitely get a program that requires no installation that will split files to deal with FAT's limitations.
2011-01-01T02:46:00.000Z	kholzer	FalseLobster	Also, while NTFS-3G's NTFS support is pretty good, it isn't perfect.
2011-01-01T02:46:00.000Z	kholzer	FalseLobster	Want me to find you a file splitter/joiner?
2011-01-01T02:46:00.000Z	FalseLobster	kholzer	I don't give a crap about mac; and I don't really want that inconvenience, although I realize that is an option.  I can find one myself, I'm trying to set up my live usb now, not get the dvd iso
2011-01-01T02:48:00.000Z	kholzer	FalseLobster	Understood.  (I'm actually typing this from a Mac; they're pretty nice IMO.)  Just set the second partition to be NTFS; life will be good.
2011-01-01T02:48:00.000Z	kholzer	FalseLobster	Or use one of the tools and format it as FAT32, and in windows, 'upgrade' it to NTFS
2011-01-01T02:49:00.000Z	kholzer	FalseLobster	Most people writing these tools are more in the hacker category; my hacker buddy likes FAT32 better than NTFS for his own data (although he really doesn't like either)
2011-01-01T02:49:00.000Z	kholzer	FalseLobster	No problem :)
2011-01-01T02:50:00.000Z	kholzer	FalseLobster	You can email me if you get stuck, my contact info is at my webpage: <http://hlzr.net>
2011-01-01T02:52:00.000Z	FalseLobster	kholzer	Thanks, hopefully won't be necessary
2011-01-01T02:53:00.000Z	kholzer	FalseLobster	Good luck then.  Have a good new year; cheers!
