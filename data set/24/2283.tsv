2010-05-10T00:11:00.000Z	Beyecixramd		oh hmm.... not possible afaik ash2dust... but imo it really is not worth it
2010-05-10T00:13:00.000Z	Beyecixramd		wow...
2010-05-10T00:14:00.000Z	Beyecixramd		how does the bug work? does it affect all clients if they are behind a specific router?
2010-05-10T00:16:00.000Z	Beyecixramd		again: how does the bug work? does it affect all clients if they are behind a specific router?
2010-05-10T00:18:00.000Z	Beyecixramd		not only in ubuntu ¬¬'
2010-05-10T00:19:00.000Z	Beyecixramd		it's all the same... get used to it or fight it
2010-05-10T00:20:00.000Z	Beyecixramd		xD
2010-05-10T00:22:00.000Z	Beyecixramd		aaaargh
2010-05-10T00:22:00.000Z	Beyecixramd		xD
2010-05-10T00:24:00.000Z	Beyecixramd		it's the way to go
2010-05-10T00:25:00.000Z	baz_	Beyecixramd	how cool is fileovermiles, never heard of it before - any idea how it works? It says there is no intermediete server, how is that possible?
2010-05-10T00:26:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	baz_	well, easy, you send a request to the server, and the client sends another request, once set them up, it will leave the connection to both sides and forget about it
2010-05-10T00:27:00.000Z	baz_	Beyecixramd	that would require my comp becoming a server, how's that achieved
2010-05-10T00:27:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	baz_	just like P2P works, it's quite simple
2010-05-10T00:28:00.000Z	baz_	Beyecixramd	p2p requires software, that i understand, how can an open web page make me a server
2010-05-10T00:28:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	baz_	with P2P your pc can be both client and a server, FOM does the same, but with a browser
2010-05-10T00:28:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	baz_	know Flash? it's software
2010-05-10T00:28:00.000Z	baz_	Beyecixramd	yeah thats my exact question, hehe... how can a browser do that
2010-05-10T00:28:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	baz_	again, Flash
2010-05-10T00:29:00.000Z	baz_	Beyecixramd	oh flash, i'm sorry, i didn't see that msg
2010-05-10T00:29:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	baz_	Flash can run stuff inside your browser, just like Java does
2010-05-10T00:29:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	baz_	pretty cool, kinda like virtual machines :)
2010-05-10T00:29:00.000Z	baz_	Beyecixramd	makes sense now, thanks
2010-05-10T00:29:00.000Z	baz_	Beyecixramd	yeah very nice find
