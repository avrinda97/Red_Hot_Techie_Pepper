2008-03-06T15:41:00.000Z	BlackDex		a friend of mine has messedup his owner/group settings and there access permissions
2008-03-06T15:41:00.000Z	BlackDex		he changed the ower/group in /
2008-03-06T15:41:00.000Z	BlackDex		is there a way to fix this?
2008-03-06T15:42:00.000Z	prince_jammys	BlackDex	recursively or only / ?
2008-03-06T15:53:00.000Z	BlackDex	prince_jammys	same here
2008-03-06T15:42:00.000Z	prince_jammys	BlackDex	ouch
2008-03-06T15:42:00.000Z	BlackDex	prince_jammys	jupp
2008-03-06T15:43:00.000Z	prince_jammys	BlackDex	that is a huge mess
2008-03-06T15:45:00.000Z	prince_jammys	BlackDex	you could try running the live cd, mounting the drive and changing owners of everything to root:root. then change the owner of his home directory to his user
2008-03-06T15:46:00.000Z	prince_jammys	BlackDex	is it just the ownership or also permissions?
2008-03-06T15:46:00.000Z	BlackDex	prince_jammys	both i think
2008-03-06T15:46:00.000Z	prince_jammys	BlackDex	what are the new permissions?
2008-03-06T15:47:00.000Z	BlackDex	prince_jammys	-rwxr-xr-x i think
2008-03-06T15:48:00.000Z	prince_jammys	BlackDex	backing up the data and reinstalling is probably easier than repairing, in this case
2008-03-06T15:49:00.000Z	prince_jammys	BlackDex	you could create a new partition and back it up. or back it up on a cd/dvd.  if you do a clean reinstall, it would be lost i think
2008-03-06T15:53:00.000Z	prince_jammys	BlackDex	personally i think that's easier than repairing everything
2008-03-06T15:53:00.000Z	prince_jammys	BlackDex	you can also make a list of all installed packages so you can reinstall them
2008-03-06T15:54:00.000Z	prince_jammys	BlackDex	read the above^
2008-03-06T15:54:00.000Z	prince_jammys	BlackDex	oh forget that
2008-03-06T15:54:00.000Z	prince_jammys	BlackDex	you can't do that because you can't log in
2008-03-06T15:55:00.000Z	prince_jammys	BlackDex	just back up /home
2008-03-06T15:56:00.000Z	prince_jammys	BlackDex	use something like Gparted to create a partition and resize the existing one. then from the ubuntu live cd, mount the existing partition and copy /home to the new partition. then reinstall over the old partition
2008-03-06T15:56:00.000Z	BlackDex	prince_jammys	i have him on the phone
