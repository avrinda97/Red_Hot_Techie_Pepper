2011-04-15T02:35:00.000Z	wizonesolutions		Hi there...I'm getting an input/output error on a particular file...is running fsck the first step I should take? And if it's ext3, what's the command I should run? I guess I have to run it while booted off a recovery disc of some sort too like SystemRescueCD (or would there be a better one)?
2011-04-15T02:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wizonesolutions	i would
2011-04-15T02:38:00.000Z	wizonesolutions	ActionParsnip	Alright. Is it most likely that the drive is going and I should replace it?
2011-04-15T02:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wizonesolutions	not sure, i'd probe it first
2011-12-06T04:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wizonesolutions	if its an internl partition, you can add a lin in /etc/fstab to mount it at boot with decent access methods as you need
2011-12-06T04:34:00.000Z	wizonesolutions	ActionParsnip	Yes, I did that, but I still can't seem to get it to mount with permissions that allow writing.
2011-12-06T04:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wizonesolutions	what line did you add?
2011-12-06T04:43:00.000Z	wizonesolutions	ActionParsnip	http://pastebin.com/DsLmye9a
2011-12-06T04:49:00.000Z	wizonesolutions	ActionParsnip	Was wondering if you'd have a chance to take a look at the link...if not it's OK, just lmk
2011-12-06T04:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wizonesolutions	what link?
2011-12-06T04:52:00.000Z	wizonesolutions	ActionParsnip	http://www.isup.me/data.gouv.fr
2011-12-06T04:53:00.000Z	wizonesolutions	ActionParsnip	http://pastebin.com/DsLmye9a
2011-12-06T04:53:00.000Z	wizonesolutions	ActionParsnip	That's what I have for this partition in pastebin
2011-12-06T04:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wizonesolutions	defaults won't be enough
2011-12-06T04:53:00.000Z	wizonesolutions	ActionParsnip	I've gone all the way up to uid=1000,gid=1000,umask=000 but nothing budges it
2011-12-06T04:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wizonesolutions	you'll need something like:  rw,user,uid=1000,auto
2011-12-06T05:00:00.000Z	wizonesolutions	ActionParsnip	We're both talking about ntfs-3g yeah? Just to confirm. Also, does NTFS-3G treat internal partitions different than external hard drives? I've got a couple externals that are mounting fine on another box, and actually other internal partitions too...dunno what's...different about this one!
2011-12-06T05:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wizonesolutions	the location of the partition is moot, as long as it is seen correctly by the kernel, all access is abstracted by the kernel.
2011-12-06T05:01:00.000Z	wizonesolutions	ActionParsnip	Anyway, no luck with those options either. I put them in exactly as you wrote them.
2011-12-06T05:01:00.000Z	wizonesolutions	ActionParsnip	Good to know. Probably diff NTFS-3G versions then is what's throwing me off
2011-12-06T05:02:00.000Z	wizonesolutions	ActionParsnip	All I needed on my home server was uid=<username>,gid=<groupname> and I was golden. But that doesn't seem to be enough here.
2011-12-06T05:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wizonesolutions	try changing ntfs-3g to auto
2011-12-06T05:05:00.000Z	wizonesolutions	ActionParsnip	You mean for the filesystem basically?
2011-12-06T05:09:00.000Z	wizonesolutions	ActionParsnip	Changing to auto wouldn't do it since netninja's suggestion didn't work.
