2011-05-22T06:17:00.000Z	fun-workin		unbelievable ... is this laptop linux-proof or what ? ... usb booting 'test ubuntu' not working 'instal from usb' not working, install by Wubi.. not working :<
2011-05-22T06:17:00.000Z	Out_Cold	fun-workin	what kind of laptop?
2011-05-22T06:19:00.000Z	Out_Cold	fun-workin	^^ have you checked the checksum?
2011-05-22T06:20:00.000Z	Out_Cold	fun-workin	the checksum is a hash value that you compare for the iso you downloaded to a hash that is on the ubuntu site. It verifies the integrety of the iso
2011-05-22T06:21:00.000Z	fun-workin	Out_Cold	ok ill read bout it and get back to ya with result.
2011-05-22T06:23:00.000Z	fun-workin	Out_Cold	will it help if i tell you that i donwloaded 3 different types of ubuntu ? is it possible that all 3 are corrupted ?
2011-05-22T06:24:00.000Z	Out_Cold	fun-workin	not likely.. although if you put them to disc, possibly.. but disc and usb, very unlikely.... Just trying to eliminate possibilities
2011-05-22T06:24:00.000Z	fun-workin	Out_Cold	also bootable usb with ubuntu was working fine on different pc ;/
2011-05-22T06:25:00.000Z	Out_Cold	fun-workin	64 bit or 32?
2011-05-22T06:26:00.000Z	fun-workin	Out_Cold	i tried both
2011-05-22T06:27:00.000Z	Out_Cold	fun-workin	i've had install issues with 64 bit before as well as 32 bit.. but after trying several different options, usually one works lol....
2011-05-22T06:28:00.000Z	fun-workin	Out_Cold	when i boot up from usb i just let it do hes job, its counting down to default choice, its try ubuntu, after it get to 0 it just restart, and it go on and on and on
2011-05-22T06:30:00.000Z	Out_Cold	fun-workin	then perhaps try a different usb installer... try pendrive linux
2011-05-22T06:32:00.000Z	Out_Cold	fun-workin	http://www.pendrivelinux.com/
2011-05-22T06:35:00.000Z	fun-workin	Out_Cold	thanks for advices ill try with other loader
2011-05-22T06:37:00.000Z	Out_Cold	fun-workin	a piece of advice, if you use the pendrive installer, it will ask you to download the file again, unless you specify the exact name of the iso you already have..
2011-05-22T06:43:00.000Z	fun-workin	Out_Cold	i used other loder and something happened. it start to load up ubuntu unfortunately it stopped after some time last message is : no plug and play decie found.
2011-05-22T06:43:00.000Z	Out_Cold	fun-workin	maybe it's a bad flash or usb port???
2011-05-22T06:43:00.000Z	Out_Cold	fun-workin	i use that installer very frequently..
2011-05-22T06:44:00.000Z	fun-workin	Out_Cold	so what should i do ? :) im newbie ;)
2011-05-22T06:45:00.000Z	Out_Cold	fun-workin	try another port? format the drive? try another stick? read the instructions for the pendrive installer (although it's pretty straight forward)
2011-05-22T06:51:00.000Z	Out_Cold	fun-workin	maybe i should ask what is the OS you are trying to make these sticks on
2011-05-22T06:52:00.000Z	Out_Cold	fun-workin	try this app.. http://sites.google.com/site/shamurxboot/download
2011-05-22T07:18:00.000Z	fun-workin	Out_Cold	meh its not working ... i give up for now, gonna get some sleep. Thanks for your time thou :)
