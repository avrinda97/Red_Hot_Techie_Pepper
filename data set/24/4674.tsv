2007-02-08T15:45:00.000Z	m_billybob	mindeq	do you actuall boot using PXE ?
2007-02-08T15:46:00.000Z	mindeq	m_billybob	hm i don't know what's PXE
2007-02-08T15:46:00.000Z	m_billybob	mindeq	its a method for booting a remote OS, ie the OS would actually be on a PXE server
2007-02-08T15:47:00.000Z	mindeq	m_billybob	i just see that text now after i installed windows and ubuntu :/ earlier i didn't saw that
2007-02-08T15:48:00.000Z	m_billybob	mindeq	give me a few, im asking a friend on another server
2007-02-08T15:48:00.000Z	mindeq	m_billybob	ok thx
2007-02-08T15:49:00.000Z	m_billybob	mindeq	what all did you do ? just by reading that error, it soudns like maybe you're trying to boot from ethernt for some reason, whether you did it on accident, or by mistake
2007-02-08T15:50:00.000Z	mindeq	m_billybob	i installed windows , but didn't do anything with network
2007-02-08T15:50:00.000Z	m_billybob	mindeq	grub, or lilo ?
2007-02-08T15:51:00.000Z	m_billybob	mindeq	that is, do you mind reinstalling ? or is this a problem ?
2007-02-08T15:52:00.000Z	m_billybob	mindeq	well this method is a bit different than what you did, and it supposed to work
2007-02-08T15:53:00.000Z	m_billybob	mindeq	http://www.hevnikov.com/blog/2006/11/13/triple-boot-xp-vista-ubuntu-with-single-boot-screen/ just leave out the Vistas part
2007-02-08T15:53:00.000Z	m_billybob	mindeq	yeah, under the BIOS options for your card
2007-02-08T15:54:00.000Z	m_billybob	mindeq	you either 1) have an intel card that has boot from ethernet enabled, or 2) the option is in the BIOS
2007-02-08T15:55:00.000Z	mindeq	m_billybob	yes laptop

2007-02-08T15:57:00.000Z	m_billybob	mindeq	it is a liveCD though yes ?
2007-02-08T15:57:00.000Z	m_billybob	mindeq	will it boot the LIveCD fine ?
2007-02-08T15:58:00.000Z	m_billybob	mindeq	do that then, when you get to the desktop, we'll try to see whats going on with menu.lst
