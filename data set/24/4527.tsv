2007-03-20T16:34:00.000Z	Jenn		Why does sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg detect the wrong graphic card, the old one? How can I fix that?
2007-03-20T16:35:00.000Z	soundray	Jenn	ignore the autodetected one, choose the proper driver at the next screen and enter the PCI ID of the card when it asks (find it out with lspci)
2007-03-20T16:36:00.000Z	Jenn	soundray	Ispci?
2007-03-20T16:36:00.000Z	soundray	Jenn	no, Lspci
2007-03-20T16:36:00.000Z	soundray	Jenn	with lspci
2007-03-20T16:36:00.000Z	Jenn	soundray	sorry but what is LSPCI?
2007-03-20T16:37:00.000Z	soundray	Jenn	enter 'man lspci' to find out
2007-03-20T16:37:00.000Z	Jenn	soundray	how do I access LSPCI?
2007-03-20T16:38:00.000Z	Jenn	soundray	ok, I got the menu. What option do I pick from there?
2007-03-20T16:39:00.000Z	soundray	Jenn	what menu?
2007-03-20T16:40:00.000Z	soundray	Jenn	that's not a menu, it's a manual page. If you read it, you will learn how to use lspci
2007-03-20T16:41:00.000Z	soundray	Jenn	it is *not* a menu
2007-03-20T16:42:00.000Z	Jenn	soundray	I understand but how do I select one of the option to view the PCI id of the graphic card?
2007-03-20T16:42:00.000Z	soundray	Jenn	lspci is a command line program
2007-03-20T16:44:00.000Z	Jenn	soundray	sorry for spell name mistake and my lack of knowledge. :(
2007-03-20T16:45:00.000Z	soundray	Jenn	never mind. Have you found the PCI ID of your new graphics card?
2007-03-20T16:45:00.000Z	Jenn	soundray	I'm trying but I have no idea how to do that! :(
2007-03-20T16:45:00.000Z	Jenn	soundray	I'm sorry.
2007-03-20T16:46:00.000Z	soundray	Jenn	just enter 'lspci' in the terminal, like any other command. It will do what the man page explains: "list all PCI devices" along with their IDs
2007-03-25T11:50:00.000Z	soundray	Jenn	you chose the more difficult sequence... It's easier to install ubuntu after windows.
2007-03-25T11:52:00.000Z	soundray	Jenn	it's definitely easier that way.
2007-03-25T11:54:00.000Z	soundray	Jenn	you could also see how it goes with ubuntu alone. Some people don't even need Windows, because Ubuntu has equivalents for everything they do.
2007-03-25T11:54:00.000Z	soundray	Jenn	others are happy running Windows programs under wine, although wine isn't fully mature yet
2007-03-25T11:55:00.000Z	soundray	Jenn	and yet another possibility is to run Windows in a virtual machine, e.g. qemu (free software) or vmware (closed software)
