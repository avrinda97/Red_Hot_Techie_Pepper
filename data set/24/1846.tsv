2012-06-27T09:50:00.000Z	paulus68	lotuspsychje	use private browsing in Firefox should be an option here

2012-07-19T10:27:00.000Z	lotuspsychje	paulus68	man squid for manual
2012-08-23T17:13:00.000Z	paulus68	lotuspsychje	Well I want to do this with ubuntu and I don't know how to retrieve my ip with Ubuntu so I think it's ubuntu related
2012-08-23T17:15:00.000Z	paulus68	lotuspsychje	problem is that my isp is changing IP on regular base and from time to time it doesn't update my dns if I can't logon to my server I have the ability to retrieve my new IP and update the dns account manually
2012-08-23T17:16:00.000Z	lotuspsychje	paulus68	there are many providers having dynamic ip's
2012-08-23T17:17:00.000Z	paulus68	lotuspsychje	that's the reason that I have a dns account but from time to time (for whatever reason) it doesn't update my ip correctly in the dns account
