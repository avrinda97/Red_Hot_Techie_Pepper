2007-08-19T14:27:00.000Z	astro76	DARKGuy	you seem to have your subnets all mixed up
2007-08-19T14:27:00.000Z	astro76	DARKGuy	make them all either .0.x or .1.x, to match your router
2007-08-19T14:27:00.000Z	DARKGuy	astro76	I have no router
2007-08-19T14:28:00.000Z	astro76	DARKGuy	well they should both be on the same subnet anyway
2007-08-19T14:28:00.000Z	DARKGuy	astro76	aren't they?
2007-08-19T14:39:00.000Z	astro76	DARKGuy	the computer that has the internet connection needs to be set up to share it
2007-08-19T14:39:00.000Z	DARKGuy	astro76	I'm using firestarter to do the job
2007-08-19T14:41:00.000Z	DARKGuy	astro76	it's on, set eth0 for internet and rausb1 for sharing, no DHCP over LAN. I can also see SMB events on the Events tab from the laptop's IP, but no outgoing/incoming connections
2007-08-19T14:41:00.000Z	DARKGuy	astro76	from the laptop's IP in the status window
2007-08-26T15:09:00.000Z	astro76	DARKGuy	you can make one if you have a regular cable
2007-08-26T15:30:00.000Z	astro76	DARKGuy	you should seriously consider a crossover cable :)
2007-08-26T15:30:00.000Z	astro76	DARKGuy	you can modify a regular one
2007-08-26T15:30:00.000Z	DARKGuy	astro76	Yeah I have that idea but I have no money, it's 5:33 am and there's no computer place open at this hour, besides I had the link working - why should I look for alternatives when there's just something wrong with Ubuntu itself?
2007-08-26T15:31:00.000Z	astro76	DARKGuy	well it will be much faster, and I assumed you had a regular ethernet cable already
2007-08-26T15:31:00.000Z	DARKGuy	astro76	yeah I know xD and if I had I wouldn't be asking =(
2007-10-29T03:04:00.000Z	astro76	DARKGuy	did you install wx2.8-examples ?
2007-10-29T03:04:00.000Z	astro76	DARKGuy	if you are doing new development you might want to stick with 2.8
2007-10-29T03:05:00.000Z	astro76	DARKGuy	but there's wx2.6 and wx2.4-examples too
2007-10-29T03:05:00.000Z	DARKGuy	astro76	no, guess I missed it o_o so I should uninstall everything wx2.4 and 2.6 and leave just 2.8 right?
2007-10-29T03:06:00.000Z	astro76	DARKGuy	you would only need the old ones if you need to compile software that still uses it, so yes
2007-10-29T03:07:00.000Z	DARKGuy	astro76	sweet :) I'm downloading the examples packages now - will they be in the same folder?
2007-10-29T03:07:00.000Z	astro76	DARKGuy	probably, do dpkg -L wx2.8-examples
2007-10-29T03:07:00.000Z	DARKGuy	astro76	ok gimme a few, it's 54% yet
2007-10-29T03:24:00.000Z	DARKGuy	astro76	well the examples are installed and in /usr/share/doc/wx2.8-examples :D thanks ^^;
