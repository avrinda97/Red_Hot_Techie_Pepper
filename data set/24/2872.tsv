2008-07-13T22:10:00.000Z	xs142		Ok I'm starting to get pissy with Samba now... I share a folder, all is dandy for about 20 minutes then it stops transfering and a message pops up (in windows) "\\XS-DESKTOP\Azu is not accessible. You might not have permission to use this network resource. Contact admin... ...The network path was not found" - Also when I reboot the shared folder is.. Unshared..
2008-07-13T22:11:00.000Z	lazertek_	xs142	you could use nfs
2008-07-13T22:11:00.000Z	xs142	lazertek_	 Go ooon
2008-07-13T22:11:00.000Z	lazertek_	xs142	?
2008-07-13T22:12:00.000Z	lazertek_	xs142	you need to ask a question for me to answer
2008-07-13T22:12:00.000Z	xs142	lazertek_	No idea what you meant with it but I'm all ears :P
2008-07-13T22:13:00.000Z	lazertek_	xs142	nfs is network file sharing... you can setup nfs file share instead of samba... works better
2008-07-13T22:13:00.000Z	xs142	lazertek_	And how?
2008-07-13T22:14:00.000Z	lazertek_	xs142	http://nfs.sourceforge.net/nfs-howto/
2008-07-13T22:16:00.000Z	xs142	lazertek_	How do I uninstal Samba fully first? Don't want any conflicts...
2008-07-13T22:16:00.000Z	lazertek_	xs142	it won't conflict
2008-07-13T22:17:00.000Z	xs142	lazertek_	Then again no reason to have both, no?
2008-07-13T22:17:00.000Z	lazertek_	xs142	unless you are going to be sharing with windows
2008-07-13T22:17:00.000Z	xs142	lazertek_	That's exactly what I'm doing :P
2008-07-13T22:17:00.000Z	lazertek_	xs142	well then afaik you can only do it with samba
2008-07-13T22:18:00.000Z	xs142	lazertek_	But how do I sort my problem?
2008-07-13T22:18:00.000Z	lazertek_	xs142	whats the problem

2008-07-13T22:20:00.000Z	lazertek_	xs142	make sure you give it read write permissions and ofcourse share it if its unshared
2008-07-13T22:20:00.000Z	xs142	lazertek_	I did and it works fine for a while and then just stops working...
2008-07-13T22:21:00.000Z	lazertek_	xs142	anything specific you do when it stop
2008-07-13T22:21:00.000Z	lazertek_	xs142	or even when you are not copying it stops
2008-07-13T22:22:00.000Z	xs142	lazertek_	I'm not doing anything specific and I haven't tried just letting it be to see if it stops but that's kinda useless as I need to transfer :P
2008-07-13T22:22:00.000Z	lazertek_	xs142	this should help http://www.debuntu.org/guest-file-sharing-with-samba
