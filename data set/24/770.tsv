2011-01-30T01:39:00.000Z	faucet		possibly, my issue is...
2011-01-30T01:39:00.000Z	ghostknife	faucet	have you even tried googling it?
2011-01-30T01:40:00.000Z	faucet	ghostknife	yes
2011-01-30T01:40:00.000Z	ghostknife	faucet	well, I just did and found it on source forge, 1st link
2011-01-30T01:40:00.000Z	faucet	ghostknife	 link is working for you?
2011-01-30T01:40:00.000Z	ghostknife	faucet	yes
2011-01-30T01:40:00.000Z	ghostknife	faucet	sourceforge doesn't have manual links
2011-01-30T01:41:00.000Z	ghostknife	faucet	it's automated and spread across servers to ensure they don't get broken links. broken links are rare and usually just timing errors
2011-01-30T01:41:00.000Z	ghostknife	faucet	I just started the download
2011-01-30T01:42:00.000Z	ghostknife	faucet	http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/gparted/gparted-live-stable/0.7.1-5/gparted-live-0.7.1-5.iso?r=&ts=1296333708&use_mirror=cdnetworks-us-1
2011-01-30T01:44:00.000Z	faucet	ghostknife	 /tmp/l_tuNGCe.bin.part could not be saved, because the source file could not be read
2011-01-30T01:44:00.000Z	ghostknife	faucet	weird
2011-01-30T01:44:00.000Z	faucet	ghostknife	imma try reboot, maybe updated something...donno, see if that works
2011-01-30T01:45:00.000Z	ghostknife	faucet	wait
2011-01-30T01:45:00.000Z	ghostknife	faucet	try: wget -c http://is.gd/Q5XnBE
2011-01-30T01:46:00.000Z	ghostknife	faucet	the problem seems to be your browser or it's configuration. do you have a proxy server configured in the browser
2011-01-30T01:47:00.000Z	ghostknife	faucet	wicket. well, must be your browser then. firefox?
2011-01-30T01:47:00.000Z	ghostknife	faucet	try chromium
2011-01-30T01:47:00.000Z	ghostknife	faucet	it's a better option either way
2011-01-30T01:47:00.000Z	ghostknife	faucet	could very well. closing+reopening could help as well
2011-01-30T01:48:00.000Z	faucet	ghostknife	thanks for the help fella
2011-01-30T02:26:00.000Z	faucet	ghostknife	it was due to needing a restart...browser fail.  thanks again
2011-01-30T02:26:00.000Z	ghostknife	faucet	cool
