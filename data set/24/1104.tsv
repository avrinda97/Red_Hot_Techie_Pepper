2010-12-19T22:04:00.000Z	Felix00		hi. is there any way to completely DISABLE cpu throttling? I got a P4 prescott, 69º on idle. I noticed when temp is 79º, cpu throttles to 75% (T2). Will modprobe -r p4_clockmod disable throttling or just disable linux from noticing it?
2010-12-19T22:04:00.000Z	Felix00		do you know what throttling is? nothing to do with frequency stepping. At 79º, freq still being 3.2 Ghz (full speed), but throttling state makes CPU 'sleep' 25% of the time 'till temp falls to 77º, then throtttle disables
2010-12-19T22:04:00.000Z	nemo	Felix00	erm....
2010-12-19T22:04:00.000Z	nemo	Felix00	throttling doesn't necessarily involve a sleep
2010-12-19T22:04:00.000Z	nemo	Felix00	can also reduce the overall clock rate
2010-12-19T22:04:00.000Z	nemo	Felix00	and 79 is very high
2010-12-19T22:09:00.000Z	Felix00	nemo	and never passes 79º on full load. throttling does not *change* the freq in mhz. you can prove by monitoring cpu freq and launching cpuburn. Instead, PC load, diminishes, as it still work to the same frequ but its 25% of the time sleeping. So *implicitily* does not change the freq, but the freq in that moment isnt full loadable.
2010-12-19T22:11:00.000Z	nemo	Felix00	I've looked up where to setup the temperature limits manually in proc
2010-12-19T22:11:00.000Z	nemo	Felix00	but that's hardly a convenient or nice way to do it
2010-12-19T22:12:00.000Z	nemo	Felix00	(looked up in the past when trying to prevent damage) sooo, gonna sit back and see if someone has a good way to do it in here. maybe do some googling of my own.
2010-12-19T22:12:00.000Z	nemo	Felix00	but 79 is still very high.
2010-12-19T22:12:00.000Z	nemo	Felix00	mine is running at 37
2010-12-19T22:14:00.000Z	nemo	Felix00	the throttling you apparently want to override ;)
2010-12-19T22:15:00.000Z	Felix00	nemo	its safe to do that. if 90º is reached, system reboots safely. chip burns at 130º+
2010-12-19T22:16:00.000Z	nemo	Felix00	I suspect being very hot for extended periods of time could acculumate damage. you might want to verify that
2010-12-19T22:17:00.000Z	nemo	Felix00	"full cicles" ? what?
2010-12-19T22:17:00.000Z	nemo	Felix00	but. yeah. you're running at twice my temperature and want more. nutty
2010-12-19T22:23:00.000Z	Felix00	nemo	i already know the intel presscots handle big temps. I saw a comparisson between northwood and presscott: they monitor stability while turning off the fan in both cpus to see throttling and shutdown. Both processors act the same way, with the only difference that prescott works 35º hotter, and crit temp is higher.
2010-12-19T22:24:00.000Z	nemo	Felix00	I'm not sure of your sources but there's a big difference between running hot for 10 minutes and running hot for hours
2010-12-19T22:24:00.000Z	nemo	Felix00	poking around online I see plenty of people who consider higher than 65 not good on a prescott
2010-12-19T22:25:00.000Z	nemo	Felix00	soo. yeah. clearly you feel you know what you're doing, I'll just drop it.  g/l, hope you get what you want and don't kill your system
2010-12-19T22:25:00.000Z	Felix00	nemo	12hrs at full load 79º last night, i repeat. i got this pc since 3 years and always was hotty. i repeat, dont worry about that
2010-12-19T22:25:00.000Z	nemo	Felix00	is all fine until it dies ;)  but ok. dropping it
