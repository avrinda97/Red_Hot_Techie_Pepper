2012-11-19T11:43:00.000Z	kevin		when I ping ubuntu, if I get "TTL=64", I can use the telnet,ftp,ssh,vnc,if I get "TTL=255", I can't use them connect ubuntu under XP, who know the reason?
2012-11-19T11:44:00.000Z	kevin		is it a firewall issue?
2012-11-19T11:46:00.000Z	kevin		anybody could help me? thanks in advance
2012-11-19T11:46:00.000Z	kevin		yes
2012-11-19T11:47:00.000Z	kevin		yes , the same network section
2012-11-19T11:47:00.000Z	kevin		XP:192.168.1.10, ubuntu:192.168.1.11
2012-11-19T11:48:00.000Z	kevin		after installing the ubuntu, I only use "sudo ufw enable 192.168.1.10".
2012-11-19T11:49:00.000Z	kevin		the issue is still there without set the ufw.
2012-11-19T11:50:00.000Z	kevin		no , the same issue
2012-11-19T11:50:00.000Z	jpds	kevin	You don't need an IP for "enable"
2012-11-19T11:51:00.000Z	jpds	kevin	You sure you're not mistaking "enable" for "allow" ?
2012-11-19T11:51:00.000Z	kevin		sorry, it is allow, not enable
2012-11-19T11:52:00.000Z	jpds	kevin	Right, that's not how you allow an IP.
2012-11-19T11:52:00.000Z	jpds	kevin	You can 'allow' ports, not IPs like that.
2012-11-19T11:52:00.000Z	jpds	kevin	Check your rules with: sudo ufw status verbose
2012-11-19T11:55:00.000Z	kevin	jpds	Anywhere ALLOW IN 192.168.1.10
2012-11-19T11:55:00.000Z	kevin		192.168.1.10 is for XP
2012-11-19T11:57:00.000Z	kevin	jpds	?
2012-11-19T11:58:00.000Z	kevin	jpds	I check the ufw command, I get "Anywhere ALLOW IN 192.168.1.10"
2012-11-19T11:58:00.000Z	kevin		 jpds: I check the ufw command, I get "Anywhere ALLOW IN 192.168.1.10"
2012-11-19T11:58:00.000Z	jpds	kevin	And if you disable the firewall, with ufw disable - the connection works?
2012-11-19T11:59:00.000Z	kevin		connection doesn't work either
2012-11-19T12:04:00.000Z	kevin	jpds	any other ways?
2012-11-19T12:05:00.000Z	jpds	kevin	Then it's not a firewall problem.
