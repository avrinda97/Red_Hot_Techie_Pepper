2007-08-14T09:46:00.000Z	efram	sin2gen2	 yah doing that now.. found the list.. just dont know how to move it yet
2007-08-14T09:59:00.000Z	efram	sin2gen2	apparently gnome x-chat that I have is a newer version cus they hide the user list under the button, and there is no way to make it stick to the side like I want it to.. (I checked their faq :P)
2007-08-14T10:00:00.000Z	sin2gen2	efram	 i have v2.8.0
2007-08-14T10:00:00.000Z	sin2gen2	efram	 i can't remember a user list not being there in prev versions though?
2007-08-14T10:00:00.000Z	efram	sin2gen2	I use 0.16 according to this app
2007-08-14T10:02:00.000Z	sin2gen2	efram	 of xchat?  hmmm
2007-08-14T10:02:00.000Z	efram	sin2gen2	 yah..
2007-08-14T10:02:00.000Z	efram	sin2gen2	I check the HELP -> about and it sais X-chat GNOME 0.16
