2008-04-10T07:15:00.000Z	marx2k		ugh... cant go to a website since I am text only :/
2008-04-10T07:15:00.000Z	Pelo	marx2k	the foolproof method is to use the restricted driver in the admin menu
2008-04-10T07:56:00.000Z	Pelo	marx2k	what is your video card ?
2008-04-10T07:57:00.000Z	marx2k	Pelo	Nvidia GeForce 6200
2008-04-10T07:57:00.000Z	Pelo	marx2k	menu > system > admin > restricted driver
2008-04-10T07:57:00.000Z	marx2k	Pelo	I will try it.
2008-04-10T08:00:00.000Z	marx2k	Pelo	restricted driver installed. Restarting computer.
2008-04-10T08:00:00.000Z	Pelo	marx2k	best of luck
2008-04-10T08:00:00.000Z	marx2k	Pelo	:)
2008-04-10T08:01:00.000Z	Pelo	marx2k	nvidia aren't playing nice with the linux community
2008-04-10T08:02:00.000Z	marx2k	Pelo	Looks like it's still gone to low-graphics mode..
2008-04-10T08:03:00.000Z	marx2k	Pelo	When it goes into Low-graphics failsafe mode, which log files should I check? Because Xorg.0.log does not show any errors
2008-04-10T08:04:00.000Z	Pelo	marx2k	  now open synaptic ,   search for nvidia settings
2008-04-10T08:04:00.000Z	Pelo	marx2k	start ti and change the rez then
2008-04-10T08:04:00.000Z	Pelo	marx2k	why do you say it is in safe mode, does it say safe mode anywhere ?
2008-04-10T08:05:00.000Z	Pelo	marx2k	 I think nvidia needs aiglx or smeting  that bit confuses me
2008-04-10T08:05:00.000Z	marx2k	Pelo	"Ubuntu is running in low-graphics mode"
2008-04-10T08:05:00.000Z	Pelo	marx2k	check the restricted driver thign again
2008-04-10T08:05:00.000Z	Pelo	marx2k	it is possibly that you will need the binairy driver ,
2008-04-10T08:06:00.000Z	Pelo	marx2k	yes
2008-04-10T08:06:00.000Z	marx2k	Pelo	Ok, trying
2008-04-26T04:33:00.000Z	Pelo	marx2k	try asking in #kubuntu
