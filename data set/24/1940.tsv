2009-07-16T06:04:00.000Z	gartral	mazda01	why not use sox?
2009-07-16T06:08:00.000Z	mazda01	gartral	what is sox?
2009-07-16T06:09:00.000Z	mazda01	gartral	i can't seem to get any program to read the disc. I have tried rhythmbox, sound juicer, and k3b
2009-07-16T06:09:00.000Z	gartral	mazda01	Sound eXchange... its an extreamly powerful tool
2009-07-16T06:09:00.000Z	gartral	mazda01	what is the disk your trying to read?
2009-07-16T06:10:00.000Z	mazda01	gartral	it's a very old scratched audio cd, a previously burnt disc not a commercially bought one.
2009-07-16T06:11:00.000Z	gartral	mazda01	sudo aptitude install sox will put sox on your system, and then you can use sox with the --parinioa flag too read the cd... as long as there are some fragments readable, you should get output
2009-07-16T06:13:00.000Z	mazda01	gartral	i did sudo aptitude install sox and it didn't find anything? I have all repo's enabled in jaunty? would you have a command to run for using sox because I am not sure how to configure sound juicer or anything else on how to use it with sox.
2009-07-16T06:14:00.000Z	gartral	mazda01	you dont use a GUI with sox, its purely used through CLI
2009-07-16T06:15:00.000Z	gartral	mazda01	oops, sox is installed by default... open a terminal and type man sox
2009-07-16T06:15:00.000Z	mazda01	gartral	ok
2009-07-16T06:17:00.000Z	mazda01	gartral	WOW. that's the biggest man page I have ever opened. also, there are no examples. i think I am just going to use dd and then use a nautilus script to convert the music to mp3 and fill out the tags using amarok tag guesser.
2009-07-16T06:52:00.000Z	mazda01	gartral	dd states that there is no Medium found.
2009-07-16T06:55:00.000Z	gartral	mazda01	sox -d /dev/cdrom -t wav /path/to/where/you/want
2009-07-16T06:56:00.000Z	mazda01	gartral	WOW. no medium found. it's useless. the cd is ruined I guess.
