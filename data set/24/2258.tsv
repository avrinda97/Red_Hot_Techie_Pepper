2009-02-21T10:49:00.000Z	[M]Maxwell	mereo	if it was xp and your using 8.10 then it would be because 8.10 uses more resources
2009-02-21T10:50:00.000Z	[M]Maxwell	mereo	it would be like going to vista.
2009-02-21T10:50:00.000Z	[M]Maxwell	mereo	personaly for my linux computer im using 8.04 LTS
2009-02-21T10:50:00.000Z	[M]Maxwell	mereo	its much faster.
2009-02-21T10:50:00.000Z	mereo	[M]Maxwell	I'll have to try Windows 7 and see how it's going be.
2009-02-21T10:51:00.000Z	[M]Maxwell	mereo	im using windows 7 on this pc right now lol
2009-02-21T10:51:00.000Z	[M]Maxwell	mereo	i love it, and it runs faster then vista.
2009-02-21T10:51:00.000Z	mereo	[M]Maxwell	lol, what about Firefox's speed in there?
2009-02-21T10:52:00.000Z	[M]Maxwell	mereo	well it all depends your pc but i have less then a second for boot time and ive got a couple add ons installed
2009-02-21T10:54:00.000Z	[M]Maxwell	mereo	whats your pc stats.
2009-02-21T10:55:00.000Z	mereo	[M]Maxwell	Athlon 64 5200+, 2 GB ram, Geforce 8800GS, 160GB + 80 GB HDs, Sound Blaster audigy...
2009-02-21T11:01:00.000Z	[M]Maxwell	mereo	true. but firefox still outpreforms
2009-02-21T10:56:00.000Z	[M]Maxwell	mereo	you should be running very quick
2009-02-21T10:57:00.000Z	mereo	[M]Maxwell	That's the thing I don't get... It's a fast cpu to render the new Ajax heavy websites and it feels slow in linux... oh well... I'll be patient...
2009-02-21T10:57:00.000Z	mereo	[M]Maxwell	IE vs FF speed in Windows 7?
2009-02-21T10:58:00.000Z	[M]Maxwell	mereo	win7 comes with IE8, and it absolutly SUCKS
2009-02-21T10:58:00.000Z	[M]Maxwell	mereo	if your gonna use win7 you cant use IE8, you have to be using chrome or firefox lol
2009-02-21T10:59:00.000Z	mereo	[M]Maxwell	lol, I've tried IE 7 and 8 in XP and it was a bad experience...
2009-02-21T11:07:00.000Z	mereo	[M]Maxwell	I don't know... on my old computer Athlon XP 1800+, k-meleon which uses Gecko seemed MUCH faster than Chrome
2009-02-21T11:08:00.000Z	[M]Maxwell	mereo	was that the chrome beta or the offical release thats out now
2009-02-21T11:09:00.000Z	mereo	[M]Maxwell	it was the official release
2009-02-21T11:10:00.000Z	[M]Maxwell	mereo	well im not sure then, from my tests chrome is faster, but i stopped using it due to compatibility issues awhile back ago
