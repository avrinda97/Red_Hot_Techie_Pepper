2008-08-24T13:15:00.000Z	cool_penguin		which leads me to think if i screwed up in some way
2008-08-24T13:15:00.000Z	cool_penguin		no dude. I have been checking manually for the past 10 days
2008-08-24T13:15:00.000Z	cool_penguin		and no updates to be seen
2008-08-24T13:16:00.000Z	cool_penguin		doing that say 0 found, 0 updates no upgrades in CLI
2008-08-24T13:16:00.000Z	cool_penguin		rtz what distro are u using?
2008-08-24T13:18:00.000Z	cool_penguin		10 days ago, I would always see updates to be available but not anymore
2008-08-24T13:19:00.000Z	cool_penguin		I had included medibuntu in the repository list, but later disabled it
2008-08-24T13:19:00.000Z	cool_penguin		thats what I remember doing 10 days ago
2008-08-24T13:20:00.000Z	cool_penguin		is there any way to find out if updates are available?
2008-08-24T13:20:00.000Z	cool_penguin		I know that in the case of Edgy, the update manager was once broken
2008-08-24T13:20:00.000Z	cabrioleur	cool_penguin	sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install upgrade ??
2008-08-24T13:21:00.000Z	cabrioleur	cool_penguin	no install, hehe
2008-08-24T13:21:00.000Z	cabrioleur	cool_penguin	so 0 updates :-)
2008-08-24T13:24:00.000Z	cabrioleur	cool_penguin	in terminal: "sudo mv /usr/share/doc/apt/examples/sources.list /etc/apt/"
2008-08-24T13:26:00.000Z	cabrioleur	cool_penguin	sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
2008-08-24T13:27:00.000Z	cabrioleur	cool_penguin	sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
2008-08-24T13:28:00.000Z	cabrioleur	cool_penguin	then everything is up-to-date
2008-08-24T13:31:00.000Z	cabrioleur	cool_penguin	it moved a copy of default list from a doc directory to a place where apt can use it. It replaced your old one.
2008-08-24T13:32:00.000Z	cabrioleur	cool_penguin	yes
2008-08-24T13:34:00.000Z	cabrioleur	cool_penguin	you can use the file from _coredump_ as well, it has more repositories with "restricted, backports" etc. as well.
2008-08-24T13:42:00.000Z	cabrioleur	cool_penguin	it had more repositories in it (more servers to fetch software from, more software in general).
2008-08-24T13:43:00.000Z	cabrioleur	cool_penguin	might be. It's not harmful, but you can expect more bugs than standard repositories.
2008-08-24T13:44:00.000Z	cabrioleur	cool_penguin	in exchange you have newer software with more whistles etc. You can, if you want to.
2008-08-24T13:45:00.000Z	cabrioleur	cool_penguin	you will have to pastebin !pastebin
