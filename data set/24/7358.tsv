2005-09-09T14:42:00.000Z	Xplo		i installed repos
2005-09-09T14:42:00.000Z	HappyFool	Xplo	read the first link ubuto sent you; it should explain
2005-09-09T14:42:00.000Z	HappyFool	Xplo	then look for unrar-nonfree in synaptic
2005-09-09T14:45:00.000Z	HappyFool	Xplo	which list is that? in synaptic?
2005-09-09T14:47:00.000Z	HappyFool	Xplo	in that case, it may be easiest to edit your sources.list directly
2005-09-09T14:47:00.000Z	HappyFool	Xplo	an example sources.list is here: http://paste.ubuntulinux.nl/969
2005-09-09T14:48:00.000Z	HappyFool	Xplo	you can use 'gksudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list' to edit the file
2005-09-09T14:48:00.000Z	HappyFool	Xplo	Quinthius' advice will work too. multiverse *should* be in the list; read the wiki again carefully and make sure you've followed the instructions
2005-09-09T14:52:00.000Z	HappyFool	Xplo	try the 'unrar-nonfree' command?
2005-09-09T14:54:00.000Z	HappyFool	Xplo	try 'dpkg -L unrar-nonfree|grep bin/' to find out the command
2005-09-09T14:55:00.000Z	HappyFool	Xplo	didn't you install the unrar-nonfree package from synaptic?
2005-09-09T14:56:00.000Z	HappyFool	Xplo	you'll need to do that to get the program ;)
2005-09-09T14:57:00.000Z	HappyFool	Xplo	in the package list in synaptic
2005-09-09T14:57:00.000Z	HappyFool	Xplo	there should be a long list (~15000) packages to choose from
2005-09-09T14:57:00.000Z	HappyFool	Xplo	i'm sure you can figure it out ;). I'm off to bed. good night all
