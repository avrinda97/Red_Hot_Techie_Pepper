2006-12-16T08:45:00.000Z	Tonren		Oh my god... can someone PLEASE help me out here?
2006-12-16T08:47:00.000Z	Tonren		OK guys, I left my laptop on and it ran out of batteries and must have tried going into hibernate.  It wrote something bogus to my swap partition. When I rebooted, it hung on Starting /scripts/pre-mount, so I popped in a live CD to check with gparted and my swap partition was no longer properly formatted.  I reformatted it as linux-swap but it's still not booting, and hanging in the same place.
2006-12-16T08:48:00.000Z	nn	Tonren	hold one sec
2006-12-16T08:48:00.000Z	nn	Tonren	my friend just fixed that yesterday, i callin n buggin him
2006-12-16T08:48:00.000Z	Tonren	nn	Thanks!
2006-12-16T08:51:00.000Z	nn	Tonren	he said he just booted and mkswap'd the swap partition
2006-12-16T08:51:00.000Z	Tonren	nn	I can't boot!!
2006-12-16T08:51:00.000Z	nn	Tonren	there's a kernel option to skip suspend, looking for it
2006-12-16T08:51:00.000Z	Tonren	nn	Oooh sweet
2006-12-16T08:51:00.000Z	Tonren	nn	I am furious that this happened.  Low-power hibernate should NOT toast the swap partition!!!
2006-12-16T08:53:00.000Z	nn	Tonren	trying to find it
2006-12-16T08:53:00.000Z	nn	Tonren	well.. it hibernates to the swap partition
2006-12-16T08:53:00.000Z	nn	Tonren	only safe place to do it to, really
2006-12-16T08:55:00.000Z	Tonren	nn	Yeah, but it shouldn't have bricked my boot
2006-12-16T08:55:00.000Z	Tonren	nn	I hate that hibernate support is so dismal
2006-12-16T08:56:00.000Z	nn	Tonren	it's pretty new code, honestly
2006-12-16T08:56:00.000Z	nn	Tonren	i can't seem to find the kernel option to tell it not to resume the suspend hrm
2006-12-16T08:57:00.000Z	nn	Tonren	digging in suspend and kernel sources for ya, hang on
2006-12-16T09:01:00.000Z	Tonren	nn	Any luck with that kernel boot option?
2006-12-16T09:03:00.000Z	nn	Tonren	it seems it's actually handled by the initd that resume uses, i think
2006-12-16T09:04:00.000Z	Tonren	nn	This sucks so furiously
2006-12-16T09:07:00.000Z	Tonren	nn	Any luck dude?
2006-12-16T09:08:00.000Z	nn	Tonren	not yet :( hibernate wont work for me.. raid0 and usb thumbdrive room :\
2006-12-16T09:10:00.000Z	nn	Tonren	my suggestion is boot off the live cd again, and mkswap /dev/hdaX where hdaX is the swap partition
