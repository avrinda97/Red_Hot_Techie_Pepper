2007-04-10T08:56:00.000Z	vox754	jrib	do you know if killing any program, gives a clean exit, or whatever?
2007-04-10T08:56:00.000Z	jrib	vox754	depends on the program
2007-04-10T09:05:00.000Z	jrib	vox754	Rooy: no, I didn't create him, that's seveas
2007-04-10T09:05:00.000Z	vox754	jrib	I know, I was just making a point
2007-04-15T14:17:00.000Z	vox754	jrib	do your magic
2007-04-20T08:27:00.000Z	vox754	jrib	so this is it? Is this channel officially supporting Feisty?
2007-04-20T08:27:00.000Z	jrib	vox754	yep!
2007-04-20T08:30:00.000Z	vox754	jrib	is devilspie mature now? Are those "rules" regular expressions?
2007-04-20T08:30:00.000Z	jrib	vox754	s-expressions, you can use regular expressions to match with
2007-04-28T08:58:00.000Z	vox754	jrib	!
2007-04-30T16:59:00.000Z	vox754	jrib	now that I think about it, could you add a pastebin for images in the !paste factoid?
2007-04-30T16:59:00.000Z	jrib	vox754	suggest it to ubotu and it will be forwarded
2007-04-30T05:00:00.000Z	vox754	jrib	ahem... not registered *cough*... I thought you guys had like instantaneous control over ubotu *cough*
2007-04-30T05:02:00.000Z	jrib	vox754	k, I'll put it on the todo list
2007-05-05T06:26:00.000Z	jrib	vox754	?
2007-05-05T06:27:00.000Z	vox754	jrib	hey things are getting strange here
2007-05-05T06:27:00.000Z	jrib	vox754	in what way?
2007-05-05T08:51:00.000Z	vox754	jrib	no need to ban
2007-05-05T08:51:00.000Z	jrib	vox754	it was a mute, and my client lagged :)
2007-05-07T16:57:00.000Z	vox754	jrib	ha faster today!
2007-05-07T16:58:00.000Z	vox754	jrib	hey, to use "rename" I think you need to know perl syntax?
2007-05-07T05:00:00.000Z	jrib	vox754	well you just need to understand regexp really
2007-05-07T05:00:00.000Z	vox754	jrib	cause I know a little regex but that seems like a mix of s/ subtitution and something else
2007-05-07T05:13:00.000Z	vox754	jrib	actually I had forgotten how pretty gvim is!
