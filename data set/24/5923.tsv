2007-09-17T13:37:00.000Z	tanath		you can write to ntfs in ubuntu
2007-09-17T13:37:00.000Z	tanath		^
2007-09-17T13:38:00.000Z	kkathman	tanath	 you can write to an existing ntfs using ubuntu, but ntfs is not a supported file system for ubuntu installs
2007-09-17T13:38:00.000Z	tanath	kkathman	not by default, but that's what ntfs-3g is for
2007-09-17T13:39:00.000Z	kkathman	tanath	 no, I think ntfs-3g is for WRITING to an existing nfts partition - there is a big difference
2007-09-17T13:39:00.000Z	tanath	kkathman	uh, that's what i was talking about. did i miss something?
2007-09-17T13:39:00.000Z	kkathman	tanath	 for instance if, for some reason you had a windows box on a network that was ntfs and you want ubuntu to write a file there
2007-09-17T13:40:00.000Z	tanath	kkathman	samba won't take care of that?
2007-09-17T13:40:00.000Z	kkathman	tanath	 as I understood, brand0con wanted to create an ntfs partition in ubuntu
2007-09-17T13:40:00.000Z	kkathman	tanath	 nope, only FAT for samba without ntfs-3g I think
2007-09-17T13:40:00.000Z	tanath	kkathman	i was just replying to you saying you can't write to ntfs from ubuntu
2007-09-17T13:41:00.000Z	kkathman	tanath	 no I was saying you could not CREATE an ntfs partition in ubuntu
2007-09-17T13:58:00.000Z	kkathman	tanath	 I got burned badly going from breezy to dapper, cuz I upgraded a bit too early
2007-09-17T13:59:00.000Z	tanath	kkathman	there were some troubles then, but i upgraded two months early from dapper to edgy with little problems, and same to feisty, and now gutsy
2007-09-17T14:00:00.000Z	kkathman	tanath	 its why I always just wait till its about one week after release :)
2007-09-17T14:00:00.000Z	tanath	kkathman	honestly, this was originally a morphix-based install that got converted to debian, and then into ubuntu, and has been upgraded since hoary and is still kicking
2007-09-17T14:00:00.000Z	tanath	kkathman	i've been upgrading a month or two early with few probs :)
2007-09-17T14:00:00.000Z	kkathman	tanath	 Ive been on ubuntu since warty :)
2007-09-17T14:00:00.000Z	tanath	kkathman	er, yeh i used that too, just that far back i forget the order :P
2007-09-17T14:01:00.000Z	kkathman	tanath	 had no probs till I got to breezy - dapper, and that was a complete reinstall but I had my /home so nbd
2007-09-17T14:01:00.000Z	kkathman	tanath	 warty was the 1st I think
2007-09-17T14:01:00.000Z	kkathman	tanath	 warty - hoary -breezy - dapper - edgy - feisty
2007-09-17T14:01:00.000Z	tanath	kkathman	i ought to move my home to a new partition, but i forget how to set up my user for that
2007-09-17T14:02:00.000Z	kkathman	tanath	 yah I did that once also - I just copy home over to one of my backup servers, then change the sources.list, do the update and dist-upgrade and hope it all goes :)
