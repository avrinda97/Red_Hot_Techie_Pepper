2005-04-08T14:19:00.000Z	slept	cmf	, what does the debian page say ?
2005-04-08T14:20:00.000Z	cmf	slept	it's on a mailing list and tehre seems to be no reply

2005-04-08T14:21:00.000Z	slept	cmf	: how do you mount it ?
2005-04-08T14:21:00.000Z	cmf	slept	fstab

2005-04-08T14:23:00.000Z	slept	cmf	: looks good, what is the credentials part for ?
2005-04-08T14:23:00.000Z	cmf	slept	username/password
2005-04-08T14:23:00.000Z	slept	cmf	nice, haven't seen that before
2005-04-08T14:25:00.000Z	slept	cmf	: you can switch off the acceleration in smb.conf that helped me when I had a strange  errors with the connection
2005-04-08T14:26:00.000Z	cmf	slept	smb.conf is only for server, or do you mean on the server (ratehr than my client machine?)
2005-04-08T14:26:00.000Z	slept	cmf	but I'm not sure if it will help
2005-04-08T14:27:00.000Z	slept	cmf	did the server configuration work before or are you trying to get it to work ?
2005-04-08T14:27:00.000Z	cmf	slept	yep, was all good, which leads me to believe it's a bug in the pkg
2005-04-08T14:30:00.000Z	slept	cmf	: you can try debian testing, that version is running fine
2005-04-08T14:30:00.000Z	cmf	slept	will do, thanks
