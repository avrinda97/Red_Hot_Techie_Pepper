2011-07-09T05:02:00.000Z	nit-wit	Delrayne	you might take a screen shot of gparted a pastebin it just so your helpers know the partitioning setup as of now
2011-07-09T05:03:00.000Z	nit-wit	Delrayne	there is an image bin as well .
2011-07-09T05:03:00.000Z	Delrayne	nit-wit	ah, ok...so whats the keys for a screenshot?
2011-07-09T05:04:00.000Z	nit-wit	Delrayne	use the screenshot in the menu and image bin  http://imagebin.org/index.php?page=add
2011-07-09T05:07:00.000Z	nit-wit	Delrayne	thanks hod on
2011-07-09T05:10:00.000Z	nit-wit	Delrayne	the partition you would resize is half full, the paging and unmovable files are going to be pretty far onto that partition. Just a resize of it=sda3 has some danger without setting it up coeewctly for resizing. Are you completely backed up?
2011-07-09T05:11:00.000Z	Delrayne	nit-wit	no, but there isn't anything on there I can't afford to lose..assuming I don't lose the operating system.
2011-07-09T05:12:00.000Z	Delrayne	nit-wit	I have defragged it today though.
2011-07-09T05:12:00.000Z	nit-wit	Delrayne	if it was me I would turn off the paging reboot it then defragg it then shrink it with gparted leaving a open space for a extended partition to put linux in
2011-07-09T05:12:00.000Z	Delrayne	nit-wit	turn of paging? how do I do that?
2011-07-09T05:15:00.000Z	nit-wit	Delrayne	you turn it off do the rebot to remove it and defragg again, follow this on how to turn t off. When your finished installing Linux you can turn t back on. http://www.mydigitallife.info/tweak-windows-vista-virtual-memory-change-or-disable-paging-file-size/
2011-07-09T05:17:00.000Z	nit-wit	Delrayne	peronally i have my paging file off altogether I just clone my setups regularly and, and stor everything externally.
2011-07-09T05:21:00.000Z	Delrayne	nit-wit	alright, headed to go turn paging off, defrag and then come back for further instructions.
2011-07-09T06:05:00.000Z	Delrayne	nit-wit	You still around?
2011-07-09T07:29:00.000Z	Delrayne	nit-wit	paging off and defragged. Now I've deleted the DellUtility and RECOVER partion and resizing the OS partition to about 125 GiB
2011-07-09T07:30:00.000Z	nit-wit	Delrayne	sounds like your on the right track Vista still boots correct?
2011-07-09T07:31:00.000Z	Delrayne	nit-wit	just started the resize about 5 minutes ago...I have no idea and afraid to test it.
2011-07-09T07:31:00.000Z	nit-wit	Delrayne	if it doesn't boot it is an easy fix. Sometimes that recovery has oart of the boot.
2011-07-09T07:32:00.000Z	nit-wit	Delrayne	you have a vista disc correct.
2011-07-09T07:32:00.000Z	Delrayne	nit-wit	sounds good...if it doesn't boot i'm not going to fight it to hard...i'll just wipe it for more ubuntu space
2011-07-09T07:32:00.000Z	Delrayne	nit-wit	negative
2011-07-09T07:33:00.000Z	nit-wit	Delrayne	W7 is not bad I never use it but would if  have to. It is installed for understanding, and for the few times I need ms word for college papers.
2011-07-09T07:35:00.000Z	Delrayne	nit-wit	no way i'll just outright buy W7, Vista, or any other OS like that without it being pre-installed on a shiny new computer.
2011-07-09T07:36:00.000Z	Delrayne	nit-wit	about how long does it take 222.78GiB to resize down to 123.63 GiB?
