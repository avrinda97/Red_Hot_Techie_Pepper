2007-06-27T06:40:00.000Z	ali1234	blackace11	i use the xpad
2007-06-27T06:40:00.000Z	ali1234	blackace11	there is a program like that, i think it's called xkeys
2007-06-27T06:41:00.000Z	ali1234	blackace11	yes, i'm sure it is in there, just forget the name
2007-06-27T06:44:00.000Z	ali1234	blackace11	xkeys is the wrong program, sorry :/
2007-06-27T06:44:00.000Z	ali1234	blackace11	you need qjoypad
2007-06-27T06:46:00.000Z	ali1234	blackace11	probably. search for it...
2007-06-27T06:49:00.000Z	ali1234	blackace11	you'll need to do a manual install then
2007-06-27T06:49:00.000Z	ali1234	blackace11	wait, joy2key is available
2007-06-27T06:50:00.000Z	ali1234	blackace11	^ what gnomefreak said
2007-06-27T06:51:00.000Z	ali1234	blackace11	if you have installed joy2key then you already have enabled universe
2007-06-27T06:54:00.000Z	ali1234	blackace11	joy2key is not a gui app, you must configure it by hand
2007-06-27T06:55:00.000Z	ali1234	blackace11	you must configure joy2key properly. read "man joy2key"
2007-06-27T06:56:00.000Z	ali1234	blackace11	just type "man joy2key" in terminal
2007-06-27T07:02:00.000Z	ali1234	blackace11	about joy2key? i'll help you configure it
2007-06-27T07:04:00.000Z	ali1234	blackace11	no, you must be registered with nickserv
2007-06-27T07:04:00.000Z	ali1234	blackace11	/msg nickserv help
2007-06-27T10:42:00.000Z	ali1234	blackace11	hey you're back, i got disconnected before, sorry about that
2007-06-27T10:44:00.000Z	ali1234	blackace11	i think from your error before, it looked like you tried to read from a none-existing axis on the joystick
2007-06-27T10:45:00.000Z	ali1234	blackace11	there window?
2007-06-27T10:46:00.000Z	ali1234	blackace11	if you're trying to msg me, you need to identify to nickserv again with the password you set earlier
