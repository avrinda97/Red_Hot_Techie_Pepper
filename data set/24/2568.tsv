2009-11-24T02:40:00.000Z	hedkandi		I once paid for kubuntu
2009-11-24T02:40:00.000Z	hedkandi		I got the cd on ebay for 2.99 or whatever
2009-11-24T02:41:00.000Z	hedkandi		And the linuxshop sells these cds, and some of the strange distros go for like 8 quiD!
2009-11-24T02:41:00.000Z	hedkandi		zachK: why?
2009-11-24T02:41:00.000Z	hedkandi		well if you apply to get a cd on the ubuntu site they say it takes 2 months to arrive!
2009-11-24T02:42:00.000Z	hedkandi		that's rubbish!
2009-11-24T02:42:00.000Z	hedkandi		At the least you need your own blank cd and some equipment.
2009-11-24T02:42:00.000Z	hedkandi		And I usually find I need to burn like 4 cds before I get one that's error-free
2009-11-24T02:43:00.000Z	Tartaros	hedkandi	or don't burn at all, use usb :)
2009-11-24T02:46:00.000Z	hedkandi	Tartaros	yes, I never considered putting the iso onto usb stick. Does that work?
2009-11-24T02:46:00.000Z	hedkandi		I didn't know my bios had the option to boot from usb
2009-11-24T02:46:00.000Z	Tartaros	hedkandi	not only does it work, it's the offical way to go now :)
2009-11-24T02:46:00.000Z	hedkandi		exciting!
2009-11-24T02:46:00.000Z	hedkandi		well that's got to be a good thing
2009-11-24T02:47:00.000Z	Tartaros	hedkandi	I'd guess so. I installed from usb myself (jaunty)
2009-11-24T02:47:00.000Z	hedkandi		I was looking at usb sticks in Borders today. They are like 12 quid for a 2gb thing which is really small and neat
2009-11-24T02:47:00.000Z	hedkandi		okay well I needn't have bought a value pack of blank cds from tesco then.
2009-11-24T02:47:00.000Z	Tartaros		!details | eduard_
2009-11-24T02:48:00.000Z	hedkandi		guess what! my memory stick which I nicked from my last employer is about 4cm long and
2009-11-24T02:48:00.000Z	hedkandi		has a capacity of 16mb
2009-11-24T02:48:00.000Z	hedkandi		so like I wonder how old it is
2009-11-24T02:48:00.000Z	hedkandi		They were cheapskates at this company! my laptop was faster than the pc they gave me!
2009-11-24T02:48:00.000Z	hedkandi		cheapskates!
2009-11-24T02:49:00.000Z	Tartaros	hedkandi	minimal ubuntu has 12mb, you can try it for fun :)
