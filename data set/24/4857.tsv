2006-12-28T10:54:00.000Z	goofey	SubMOA	where do they want you to type it into?
2006-12-28T10:55:00.000Z	SubMOA	goofey	would it have mattered?
2006-12-28T10:55:00.000Z	goofey	SubMOA	sure - command line vs irc chat line vs?????
2006-12-28T10:56:00.000Z	SubMOA	goofey	righto.  I see what you mean.
2006-12-28T10:57:00.000Z	goofey	SubMOA	in irssi, /load loads a plugin. If full path isn't given, irssi searches the plugin from directories
2006-12-28T10:57:00.000Z	SubMOA	goofey	that is from the IRC Text box, right?  and that plugin, is it exploitable?
2006-12-28T10:58:00.000Z	goofey	SubMOA	yes, from the irc text box - what was the plugin again?
2006-12-28T10:58:00.000Z	SubMOA	goofey	no plugin that I'm aware of, butu it said to type "/link #2600"
2006-12-28T10:59:00.000Z	goofey	SubMOA	oh, link - thought you said load - let me look
2006-12-28T10:59:00.000Z	SubMOA	goofey	rgr
2006-12-28T10:59:00.000Z	goofey	SubMOA	no clue as to what that would do
2006-12-28T11:00:00.000Z	SubMOA	goofey	XChat
2006-12-28T11:00:00.000Z	goofey	SubMOA	I would look in  xchat help to make sure it's not something xchat has built in - irssi doesn't FWIW
2006-12-28T11:01:00.000Z	SubMOA	goofey	ok, thank you for your help
2006-12-28T11:27:00.000Z	goofey	SubMOA	any luck with the ntfs thing?
2006-12-28T11:30:00.000Z	goofey	SubMOA	oh, ok, nm
2006-12-28T11:30:00.000Z	SubMOA	goofey	.....yet

2006-12-28T12:08:00.000Z	goofey	SubMOA	what desktop?  gnome, kde, ?
2006-12-28T12:09:00.000Z	goofey	SubMOA	i use kde, but what happens when you right click on tfhe desktop - is there an option  for create shortcut?
2006-12-28T12:10:00.000Z	SubMOA	goofey	perhaps I got ahead of myself.  Uno Momento, pour favor
2006-12-28T12:10:00.000Z	goofey	SubMOA	no worries
2006-12-28T12:12:00.000Z	goofey	SubMOA	you might also try creating a symlink in ~/Desktop to the script....
2006-12-28T12:48:00.000Z	goofey	SubMOA	sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get upgrade
