2009-03-28T17:08:00.000Z	iceroot	dhruvasagar	k3b (yes its kde-app but its the best imo)
2009-03-28T17:11:00.000Z	iceroot	dhruvasagar	?
2009-03-28T17:12:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	iceroot	sry for that, I though |PaperTiger| mentioned iceroot as something similar to IRC that I didn't know about so I asked ... :)
2009-03-28T17:12:00.000Z	iceroot	dhruvasagar	ok :)
2009-03-28T17:12:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	iceroot	what's bnc?
2009-03-28T17:13:00.000Z	iceroot	dhruvasagar	bouncer
2010-09-27T12:38:00.000Z	iceroot	dhruvasagar	sure
2010-09-27T12:39:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	iceroot	how ?
2010-09-27T12:39:00.000Z	iceroot	dhruvasagar	just installing it, the architectur doesnt matter (if you dont have dependencies on 64bit libs)
2010-09-27T12:40:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	iceroot	just installing it ? often i've seen when I try to install a deb meant for 32 bit it says that the deb is for a different architecture and doesn't allow me
2010-09-27T12:41:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	iceroot	guitar pro 6 is available for ubuntu, but afaik its only for 32 bit, so I was thinking if I should buy or not...
2010-09-27T12:47:00.000Z	iceroot	dhruvasagar	#android
2010-09-27T12:48:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	iceroot	well I meant more like hacking android from ubuntu...
2010-09-27T12:48:00.000Z	iceroot	dhruvasagar	doesnt matter if you "hack" android with ubuntu, windows, mac os or something like that, so #android is the correct place
2010-09-27T12:49:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	iceroot	but I don't want to know how to hack android...
2010-09-27T12:50:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	iceroot	anyways i'll rephrase
2010-09-27T12:54:00.000Z	iceroot	dhruvasagar	vim-tiny is not a malware of course
2010-09-27T13:01:00.000Z	iceroot	dhruvasagar	its just ignoring, that the package is for another architecture
2010-09-27T13:02:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	iceroot	can you just have a look at this link - http://getsatisfaction.guitar-pro.com/arobas_music/topics/do_you_plan_to_release_a_64_bit_version_of_guitar_pro_6 ?
2010-09-27T13:03:00.000Z	iceroot	dhruvasagar	yes, that is the common way
2010-09-27T13:03:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	iceroot	ok cool, thanks
2011-10-14T15:24:00.000Z	iceroot	dhruvasagar	download a theme you want
2011-10-14T15:26:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	iceroot	can you help me with that ? some links / resources !?
