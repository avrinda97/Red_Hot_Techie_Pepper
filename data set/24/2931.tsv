2008-06-21T16:18:00.000Z	gordonjcp	SyncMaster213	no
2008-06-21T16:18:00.000Z	gordonjcp	SyncMaster213	What exactly are you trying to do?
2008-06-21T16:19:00.000Z	gordonjcp	SyncMaster213	What exactly are you trying to do?
2008-06-21T16:19:00.000Z	gordonjcp	SyncMaster213	or, to put it another way, rather than focusing on trying to find a specific app to solve a problem, how about describing the problem you're trying to solve?
2008-06-21T16:20:00.000Z	SyncMaster213	gordonjcp	I'm trying to download videos from youtube - I've used several tools that I don't like and I used to have Capture 'n Convert
2008-06-21T16:20:00.000Z	SyncMaster213	gordonjcp	I know it's on sourceforge but I can't seem to find it
2008-06-21T16:20:00.000Z	SyncMaster213	gordonjcp	it was a great tool
2008-06-21T16:20:00.000Z	SyncMaster213	gordonjcp	I'm aware of all the other tools that you can find via google like converttube so please don't post them
2008-06-21T16:21:00.000Z	gordonjcp	SyncMaster213	there is absolutely nothing called "Capture 'n Convert" on sf.net
2008-06-21T16:21:00.000Z	gordonjcp	SyncMaster213	are you sure you've got the right name?
2008-06-21T16:21:00.000Z	SyncMaster213	gordonjcp	I can also pull the files from the firefox cache but I just liked the features and organisation of capture 'n convert
2008-06-21T16:22:00.000Z	gordonjcp	SyncMaster213	wouldn't be "youtubecatcher" would it?
2008-06-21T16:23:00.000Z	SyncMaster213	gordonjcp	I'll take a look at the program
2008-06-21T16:23:00.000Z	SyncMaster213	gordonjcp	I've received several other options and suggestions but I just really liked the program and I re-imaged my lapper and didn't keep the program
2008-06-21T16:23:00.000Z	SyncMaster213	gordonjcp	from the command prompt the program was executed by using the command "cac"
2008-06-21T16:23:00.000Z	gordonjcp	SyncMaster213	there's always something you foreget to back up
2008-06-21T16:24:00.000Z	SyncMaster213	gordonjcp	so true
2008-06-21T16:25:00.000Z	gordonjcp	SyncMaster213	that is actually called "catch and convert", looks good
2008-06-21T16:26:00.000Z	SyncMaster213	gordonjcp	please let this be a lesson to you to never speak in absolutes: "<gordonjcp> SyncMaster213: there is absolutely nothing called "Capture 'n Convert" on sf.net"
2008-06-21T16:27:00.000Z	gordonjcp	SyncMaster213	there wasn't - I was absolutely correct
2008-06-21T16:27:00.000Z	gordonjcp	SyncMaster213	it was called something else
