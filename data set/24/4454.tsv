2007-10-06T07:46:00.000Z	LM1		so I have a command I want to execute from nautilus-actions   I need it to be run on all files inside folders and subfolders but not the folders themselves.    %M doesn't seem to work does anyone have any more suggestions?
2007-10-06T07:47:00.000Z	jrib	LM1	find
2007-10-06T07:49:00.000Z	jrib	LM1	'find' is a command
2007-10-06T07:50:00.000Z	LM1	jrib	yes I know but I need a parameter not a command :)  its for nautilus-actions
2007-10-06T07:52:00.000Z	jrib	LM1	pass 'find'  the top-level directory and use -type and -exec
2007-10-06T07:53:00.000Z	LM1	jrib	yes thanks but I am trying to use nautilus actions to do this so I can right click a folder and execute the command without brining up cli
2007-10-06T07:53:00.000Z	LM1	jrib	thanks anyway
2007-10-06T07:54:00.000Z	jrib	LM1	yes I know... this should work
2007-10-06T07:55:00.000Z	LM1	jrib	ok so I put -type -exec into the parameters option in nautilus-actions?
2007-10-06T07:55:00.000Z	jrib	LM1	in some form
2007-10-06T07:58:00.000Z	jrib	LM1	you know shred is useless on ext3?
2007-10-06T07:59:00.000Z	LM1	jrib	according to the manual it works fine on ext as long as you don't use data=journaled mode
2007-10-06T07:59:00.000Z	LM1	jrib	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/39762/  read for yourself
2007-10-06T08:00:00.000Z	jrib	LM1	right
2007-10-06T08:05:00.000Z	jrib	LM1	make sure you test with some user that has no important files
2007-10-06T08:30:00.000Z	LM1	jrib	I googled shred and exec and find etc and I found this page I followed his instructions but they didn't work http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,1697,2126528,00.asp
2007-10-06T08:32:00.000Z	jrib	LM1	how did you set it up
2007-10-06T08:33:00.000Z	LM1	jrib	just as it said in the article.
2007-10-06T08:34:00.000Z	jrib	LM1	paste here what you input in nautilus actions
2007-10-06T08:44:00.000Z	LM1	jrib	 ok thanks I got it working finally  path= find  parameters= %M -type f -exec shred -f -u -z '{}' \;     but is there a way to password protect it like sudo or gksu
2007-10-06T08:47:00.000Z	jrib	LM1	you could create a confirmation dialog with zenity maybe
2007-10-06T08:48:00.000Z	LM1	jrib	whats zenity? sorry im a noob and thank you for all the help
2007-10-06T08:50:00.000Z	jrib	LM1	'man zenity'  should be easy to follow.  Try 'zenity --info' for an example
2007-10-06T08:57:00.000Z	LM1	jrib	thanks but I think zenity is a bit over my head :C
