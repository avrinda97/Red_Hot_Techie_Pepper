2010-12-24T22:56:00.000Z	Guest55575	ilovefairuz	thanks
2010-12-24T22:59:00.000Z	Guest55575	ilovefairuz	now what?
2010-12-24T23:00:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	Guest55575	does it show that the partition occupy all of that 100 gigs ?
2010-12-24T23:00:00.000Z	Guest55575	ilovefairuz	yup
2010-12-24T23:01:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	Guest55575	what command are you using to check disk space?
2010-12-24T23:01:00.000Z	Guest55575	ilovefairuz	was just right clicking in nautilus
2010-12-24T23:01:00.000Z	Guest55575	ilovefairuz	i also did fdisk -l
2010-12-24T23:02:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	Guest55575	df -h
2010-12-24T23:03:00.000Z	Guest55575	ilovefairuz	/dev/sda4              97G   58G   35G  63% /
2010-12-24T23:03:00.000Z	Guest55575	ilovefairuz	but theres no directories that contain the ammount of space that is missing
2010-12-24T23:03:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	Guest55575	97G is total capacity (after formatting) .. 58 used and 35 free.. so looks fine
2010-12-24T23:04:00.000Z	Guest55575	ilovefairuz	theres only 6.2gig used by my home folder though...
2010-12-24T23:05:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	Guest55575	du --max-depth=1 -h
2010-12-24T23:05:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	Guest55575	add / to the end if that's your root partition, otherwise, path the path to where you mounted it
2010-12-24T23:06:00.000Z	Guest55575	ilovefairuz	ooh thats a usefull command
2010-12-24T23:06:00.000Z	Guest55575	ilovefairuz	it says theres 46gig used by ./.config
2010-12-24T23:07:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	Guest55575	add .config to the end of the command to limit it to that directory
2010-12-24T23:07:00.000Z	Guest55575	ilovefairuz	ahh its coming from transmission
2010-12-24T23:08:00.000Z	Guest55575	ilovefairuz	transmittion is reserving the space do you think?
2010-12-24T23:08:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	Guest55575	yes it does
2010-12-24T23:08:00.000Z	Guest55575	ilovefairuz	ah ok. thats solved then. thank you very much for your time :)
2010-12-24T23:08:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	Guest55575	you're welcome
