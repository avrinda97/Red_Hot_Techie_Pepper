2009-06-03T07:02:00.000Z	Dethroned		I heard that Ubuntu doesn't like AMD processors...is that right?
2009-06-03T07:03:00.000Z	Dethroned		Kalmi...I don't remember...it might have been ATI graphics cards...It was some thingy that didn't work well with Ubuntu
2009-06-03T07:03:00.000Z	cabrey	Dethroned	it's not that Ubuntu doesn't *like* ATI, it's just ATI releases rather low quality drivers
2009-06-03T07:08:00.000Z	cabrey	Dethroned	you can get a HD 3200
2009-06-03T07:17:00.000Z	cabrey	Dethroned	depends on your hardware
2009-06-03T07:36:00.000Z	cabrey	Dethroned	Never!!
2009-06-13T07:25:00.000Z	cabrey	Dethroned	try a torrent
2009-06-13T07:25:00.000Z	Dethroned	cabrey	 how do I install a torrent of updates from Ubuntu's own update and install methods?
2009-06-13T07:26:00.000Z	cabrey	Dethroned	oh updates. thought you meant ISO's, have you run a speed test?
2009-06-13T07:27:00.000Z	Dethroned	cabrey	yup...I'm getting like 4mbps but like 4000 bytes through Ubuntu updates and the install options
2009-06-13T07:28:00.000Z	Dethroned	cabrey	any ideas?
2009-06-13T07:28:00.000Z	cabrey	Dethroned	have you tried a miror near you?
2009-06-13T07:29:00.000Z	Dethroned	cabrey	yes...I'm getting the same thing from all of them
2009-06-13T07:29:00.000Z	cabrey	Dethroned	do you run a firewall?
2009-06-13T07:29:00.000Z	Dethroned	cabrey	i have yet to install one
2009-06-13T07:31:00.000Z	cabrey	Dethroned	remove the us.* from your sources.list
2009-06-13T07:32:00.000Z	Dethroned	cabrey	how do i do that?
2009-06-13T07:32:00.000Z	cabrey	Dethroned	alt-f2 -> gksu gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
2009-06-13T07:33:00.000Z	cabrey	Dethroned	make a backup of sources.list first
2009-06-13T07:34:00.000Z	Dethroned	cabrey	 I think I might have found a fix...I used MIT's server because I heard it was fast and bam...fast downloads
2009-06-13T07:34:00.000Z	Dethroned	cabrey	 I guess a lot of the servers are just overloaded
2009-06-13T07:34:00.000Z	cabrey	Dethroned	ok, if that works for you :)
2009-06-13T07:34:00.000Z	cabrey	Dethroned	yea
2009-06-13T07:34:00.000Z	Dethroned	cabrey	thanks for your time
