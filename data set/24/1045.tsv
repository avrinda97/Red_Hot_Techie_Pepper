2012-05-16T00:59:00.000Z	RingZer0		... now if i could find someone that can help me print :)
2012-05-16T00:59:00.000Z	RingZer0		I should have waited till after my mortgage paperwork was done before changing OSes
2012-05-16T01:01:00.000Z	RingZer0		but how do i tell if the printer has port 9100 open when its a usb printer?
2012-05-16T01:01:00.000Z	RingZer0		or how do I know what the 'uri' is when there is not any check that appears (that i can tell)
2012-05-16T01:02:00.000Z	RingZer0		i have went through all the help pages too :P
2012-05-16T01:02:00.000Z	RingZer0		they all cater to network printers .
2012-05-16T01:02:00.000Z	RingZer0		nope ... old phootsmart ... (2 yr old, lol)
2012-05-16T01:03:00.000Z	RingZer0		i have driver
2012-05-16T01:03:00.000Z	RingZer0		its in the list to select from
2012-05-16T01:03:00.000Z	Aethelred	RingZer0	my printer's URI is: socket://192.168.1.105:9100
2012-05-16T01:03:00.000Z	RingZer0	Aethelred	not a network printer.
2012-05-16T01:03:00.000Z	Aethelred	RingZer0	if you're wondering about which port... why not just try 9100 first?
2012-05-16T01:03:00.000Z	Aethelred	RingZer0	ahh....
2012-05-16T01:03:00.000Z	RingZer0	Aethelred	its usb
2012-05-16T01:04:00.000Z	Aethelred	RingZer0	hang on... I once had a printer hooked up directly... let me check if I still have that
2012-05-16T01:11:00.000Z	Aethelred	RingZer0	pretty sure it was: usb://EPSON%20Stylus%20CX6000     ... which I recall was unusual at that time.  Usually it's:  usb://<make>/<model>
2012-05-16T01:11:00.000Z	Aethelred	RingZer0	the %20  are escaped spaces
2012-05-16T01:12:00.000Z	RingZer0	Aethelred	^
2012-05-16T01:13:00.000Z	Aethelred	RingZer0	it's an HP printer?
2012-05-16T01:13:00.000Z	RingZer0	Aethelred	yeah.
2012-05-16T01:14:00.000Z	RingZer0	Aethelred	i know its hostname, so i'll give that a try.
2012-05-16T01:14:00.000Z	Aethelred	RingZer0	have you looked here?  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HpAllInOne
2012-05-16T01:16:00.000Z	Aethelred	RingZer0	good luck. Personally, I avoid printers. They are evil. But I'd be happy if you fixed your problem.   :)
