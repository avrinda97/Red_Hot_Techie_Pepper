2011-12-03T00:57:00.000Z	gribouille		when I try to start gvim, I get the following error message : "(gvim:9660): Gnome-WARNING **: Accessibility: failed to find module 'libgail-gnome' which is needed to make this application accessible   (gvim:9660): Gnome-WARNING **: Accessibility: failed to find module 'libgail' which is needed to make this application accessible   ERROR:accessible.c:556:spi_accessible_construct: assertion failed: (o)" what does it mean?
2011-12-03T00:58:00.000Z	escott	gribouille	it means libgail is not present so the accessibility features will be missing. if you dont need accessibility (screen reading etc) dont worry about it
2011-12-03T00:58:00.000Z	gribouille	escott	but gvim crashes, so I worry
2011-12-03T00:59:00.000Z	gribouille	escott	how can I disable accessibility?
2011-12-03T01:00:00.000Z	escott	gribouille	if it is crashing then make sure libgail is installed. it looks like it needs libgail18
2011-12-03T01:01:00.000Z	gribouille	escott	libgail18 is installed
2011-12-03T01:02:00.000Z	escott	gribouille	what does ldd `which gvim` | grep gail say
2011-12-03T01:03:00.000Z	gribouille	escott	libgailutil.so.18 => /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libgailutil.so.18 (0xb5a69000)
2011-12-03T01:04:00.000Z	escott	gribouille	do you have anything pinned?
2011-12-03T01:04:00.000Z	gribouille	escott	no
2011-12-03T01:04:00.000Z	gribouille	escott	why?
2011-12-03T01:05:00.000Z	escott	gribouille	it sounds like the version of libgail installed is not compatible with the version of gvim you have installed. i would try and reinstall those versions/make sure you are using the versions in the default ubuntu archives
2011-12-03T01:06:00.000Z	gribouille	escott	but that's what I did. I did a fresh install of oneiric
2011-12-03T01:06:00.000Z	escott	gribouille	and this is a 32bit install?
2011-12-03T01:06:00.000Z	gribouille	escott	yes
2011-12-03T01:07:00.000Z	gribouille	escott	what version of libgail should I be using?
2011-12-03T01:09:00.000Z	escott	gribouille	gvim is still using the old gtk2 libraries and the associated gail library. but it appears you have that installed. can you ldd `which gvim` and make sure that there are no missing libraries. did you install gvim or gnome-vim
2011-12-03T01:10:00.000Z	gribouille	escott	gvim has all the required libraries.
2011-12-03T01:11:00.000Z	gribouille	escott	I have installed vim-gnome, vim-gtk, vim-gui-common
2011-12-03T01:12:00.000Z	escott	gribouille	i dont know exactly what is going on, but on my system i have vim-gnome, and vim-gui-common but vim-gtk is NOT installed. i would try removing all vim related packages and then install only vim-gnome in case there is a conflict of some kind
2011-12-03T01:13:00.000Z	gribouille	escott	I removed vim-gtk, but it doesn't change anything
2011-12-03T01:14:00.000Z	escott	gribouille	reinstall vim-gnome and vim-gui-common
2011-12-03T01:17:00.000Z	gribouille	escott	I reinstalled vim-gnome and vim-gui-common, but the problem remains
2011-12-03T01:18:00.000Z	escott	gribouille	i guess check and see if there are any bugs on launchpad, but gvim is a fairly commonly installed package. i would think that would be tested. you could also remove/rename your .gvimrc in case it is causing a conflict
