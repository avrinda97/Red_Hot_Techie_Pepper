2009-12-25T15:04:00.000Z	digitalchemist	Guest23799	try making a backup of your xorg.conf, deleting it from /etc then rebooting
2009-12-25T15:05:00.000Z	Guest23799	digitalchemist	: i dont know that back up process tat all
2009-12-25T15:06:00.000Z	digitalchemist	Guest23799	sudo mv /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.bak
2009-12-25T15:10:00.000Z	Guest23799	digitalchemist	not working
2009-12-25T15:10:00.000Z	digitalchemist	Guest23799	the command failed?
2009-12-25T15:10:00.000Z	Guest23799	digitalchemist	yes
2009-12-25T15:11:00.000Z	digitalchemist	Guest23799	so you should be able to move the xorg.conf file to another location and reboot
2009-12-25T15:11:00.000Z	Guest23799	digitalchemist	mine drivers are up to date but still i am not able to get the resolution
2009-12-25T15:12:00.000Z	Guest23799	digitalchemist	ok
2009-12-25T15:13:00.000Z	Guest23799	digitalchemist	how to move xorg.conf
2009-12-25T15:14:00.000Z	Guest23799	digitalchemist	i need the correct path
2009-12-25T15:14:00.000Z	digitalchemist	Guest23799	/etc/X11/xorg.conf
2009-12-25T15:16:00.000Z	digitalchemist	Guest23799	so you don't have one already. nevermind, this won't fix it. I've had xorg.conf cause problems before and deleting it can fix them sometimes... but you don't even have one
2009-12-25T15:16:00.000Z	digitalchemist	Guest23799	that's all I know about this. I don't have any intel video hardware
