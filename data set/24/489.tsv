2011-07-31T11:55:00.000Z	predatore	Nobgul	I updated the OS before all this happened, and I noticed that the log in screen changed with that: There is no bar at the bottom, I have a drop down menu now with "User Profile" "Ubuntu" and "Recovery" instead.
2011-07-31T11:56:00.000Z	predatore	Nobgul	& nsadmin: Basically I'm just trying to reset this back to the way it was before everything went broken without having to reinstall everything. I am still VERY VERY new to this linux thing so any advice is appreciated.
2011-07-31T11:59:00.000Z	predatore	Nobgul	& nsadmin: I've scowered google for an answer to that question but I could only find things that didn't work. the Sudo apt-get ubuntu-desktop command didn't work either. Creating a new user, I get an error about "Gnome Session failed to start" or something to that effect.
2011-07-31T12:00:00.000Z	Nobgul	predatore	I have never encountered this exact issue, sorry i can't be more help =(
2011-07-31T12:01:00.000Z	predatore	Nobgul	thats fine. Not many people are stupid enough to do that... lol
2011-07-31T12:01:00.000Z	Nobgul	predatore	mabey reinstall unity?
2011-07-31T12:02:00.000Z	predatore	Nobgul	I tried the "Sudo apt-get --reinstall ubuntu desktop thing.. *not sure if thats exactly the command, just from memory* but it didn't fix anything..
2011-07-31T12:03:00.000Z	predatore	Nobgul	If I install Unity and Compiz - Will it try to break Gnome3? Because thats the only way I"m able to get any type of working ui.
2011-07-31T12:03:00.000Z	predatore	Nobgul	I noticed also that my theme manager is... gone?

2011-07-31T12:08:00.000Z	Nobgul	predatore	You can try to do sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop  it may install the missing peices. not sure though
