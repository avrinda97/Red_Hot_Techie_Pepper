2009-12-09T14:22:00.000Z	Slart	meowbuntu	which version of ubuntu?
2009-12-09T14:22:00.000Z	meowbuntu	Slart	karmic
2009-12-09T14:23:00.000Z	Slart	meowbuntu	then you might want to find another howto.. karmic uses grub2 afaik
2009-12-09T14:23:00.000Z	Slart	meowbuntu	unless you updated from an earlier version, of course
2009-12-09T14:23:00.000Z	meowbuntu	Slart	the sitre i posted has the commands but i cant work out how to add immage file name. there seems to be no inderacation
2009-12-09T14:24:00.000Z	meowbuntu	Slart	ubuntu karmic full install not upgrade.
2009-12-09T14:25:00.000Z	Slart	meowbuntu	that article is from 2006, more than 3 years old.. things have changed a lot in ubuntu since then.. including a brand new version of grub
2009-12-09T14:25:00.000Z	meowbuntu	Slart	i understand that i missed how old it ws thats all
2009-12-09T14:26:00.000Z	Slart	meowbuntu	yea.. I was typing when I saw your next line =)
2010-01-12T16:07:00.000Z	Slart	meowbuntu	I'm guessing that playonlinux is based on wine in some way
2010-01-12T16:08:00.000Z	meowbuntu	Slart	 am not sure
2010-01-12T16:08:00.000Z	Slart	meowbuntu	which is best would depend on what you're going to use it for, what features you require.. try them both and see which one you like
2010-01-12T16:08:00.000Z	meowbuntu	Slart	http://www.playonlinux.com/en/
2010-01-12T16:10:00.000Z	meowbuntu	Slart	also http://wiki.winehq.org/PlayOnLinux
2010-01-12T16:11:00.000Z	meowbuntu	Slart	very interesting playonlinux seems to be a front end for wine.
2010-01-12T16:11:00.000Z	Slart	meowbuntu	yes
2010-02-05T14:38:00.000Z	Slart	meowbuntu	seen the movie.. *sigh*.. I've read the books
2010-02-05T14:39:00.000Z	meowbuntu	Slart	ok i liked the montipython version of the movie best
2010-03-13T14:33:00.000Z	Slart	meowbuntu	eh.. those don't look like guis for squid at all.. for vim perhaps
2010-03-23T14:26:00.000Z	Slart	meowbuntu	see ubottus link a couple of lines up
2010-03-23T14:27:00.000Z	meowbuntu	Slart	in futur did you know you can do this !(ubottu comand) | (nickname)
