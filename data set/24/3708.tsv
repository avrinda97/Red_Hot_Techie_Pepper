2008-02-19T06:48:00.000Z	TopRamen	jimcooncat	yep
2008-02-19T06:43:00.000Z	jimcooncat	TopRamen	do you want to share the screen you're working on, or forward a new session?
2008-02-19T06:44:00.000Z	TopRamen	jimcooncat	share the screen I'm working on
2008-02-19T06:44:00.000Z	TopRamen	jimcooncat	I just tried connection locally and it worked but the other user is trying to connect and it's failing
2008-02-19T06:45:00.000Z	jimcooncat	TopRamen	if you use gnome, you can use System->Preferences->Remote Desktop
2008-02-19T06:47:00.000Z	jimcooncat	TopRamen	vncserver is more useful if another user wants to pop into their own account on your computer
2008-02-19T06:48:00.000Z	TopRamen	jimcooncat	yah I'm running gnome and had set it up via System -> Preferences -> Remote Desktop
2008-02-19T06:48:00.000Z	TopRamen	jimcooncat	and I can connect from the local network but the other user cannot
2008-02-19T06:48:00.000Z	TopRamen	jimcooncat	I mean he cannot connect from a remote network
2008-02-19T06:48:00.000Z	TopRamen	jimcooncat	let me make sure his remote traffic isn't firwalled
2008-02-19T06:48:00.000Z	jimcooncat	TopRamen	is the other user going across the internet to you?
2008-02-19T06:49:00.000Z	TopRamen	jimcooncat	and he's connecting the the same session as me because he wants to show me something
2008-02-19T06:49:00.000Z	jimcooncat	TopRamen	more than likely is firewalled, or you need to forward the port from your router
2008-02-19T06:49:00.000Z	TopRamen	jimcooncat	already forwarded the port on my end
2008-02-19T06:51:00.000Z	TopRamen	jimcooncat	is the defailt port 5900?
2008-02-19T06:52:00.000Z	TopRamen	jimcooncat	or is 5900 default for internal connections and 5800 default for external
2008-02-19T06:52:00.000Z	jimcooncat	TopRamen	one is for regular vnc, one for java access. I'll check
2008-02-19T06:53:00.000Z	TopRamen	jimcooncat	thanks
2008-02-19T06:54:00.000Z	jimcooncat	TopRamen	I think its 5900
2008-02-19T06:54:00.000Z	TopRamen	jimcooncat	yah 5900 is correct... did some checking myself
2008-02-19T06:54:00.000Z	TopRamen	jimcooncat	his outbound traffic isn't restricted at all yet he still cannot connect
2008-02-19T06:54:00.000Z	TopRamen	jimcooncat	have no idea why
2008-02-19T06:54:00.000Z	TopRamen	jimcooncat	my port forwarding rules are setup properly too
2008-02-19T06:56:00.000Z	jimcooncat	TopRamen	sorry, I can't figure that out either
