2007-08-22T09:47:00.000Z	jimcooncat		is "cups-pdf" the right package for a pdf printer driver?
2007-08-22T09:48:00.000Z	Pici	jimcooncat	Yes.
2007-10-01T13:21:00.000Z	Pici	jimcooncat	Difficult to get java and flash to work.  There are few closed implementations of proprietary software for 64bits.
2007-10-01T13:22:00.000Z	jimcooncat	Pici	-- are there usable workarounds for these issues?
2007-10-01T13:22:00.000Z	Pici	jimcooncat	There are.
2007-10-01T13:24:00.000Z	jimcooncat	Pici	Thanks. If it's just those two then it'll be ok for me to do the work, rather than having to support two architectures.
2007-12-29T00:32:00.000Z	Pici	jimcooncat	try ##hardware
2008-04-24T22:58:00.000Z	jimcooncat	Pici	no problem with server type software, e.g., Apache2, DRBD, KVM, etc. on amd64?
2008-04-24T22:59:00.000Z	Pici	jimcooncat	No, those should work fine
2008-04-24T22:59:00.000Z	jimcooncat	Pici	thanks. going to be doing a large (for me) investment in it
2008-10-06T18:29:00.000Z	Pici	jimcooncat	I'm not sure if this would work, but I think you might be able to put it in /etc/skel/
2008-10-06T18:29:00.000Z	Pici	jimcooncat	i.e.: /etc/skel/.ssh/authorized_keys  (may want to google the use of the skel directory though, but it should work)
2008-10-06T18:30:00.000Z	jimcooncat	Pici	that would be alright (and give me access to all future accounts) but debian-installer has already made the default users /home dir by then
2008-10-06T18:30:00.000Z	Pici	jimcooncat	hmm
2008-10-06T18:30:00.000Z	Pici	jimcooncat	I'm not really familiar with the installer, sorry :/
2008-10-06T18:30:00.000Z	jimcooncat	Pici	I guess I should just package up a script?
2008-10-06T18:31:00.000Z	Pici	jimcooncat	That would work too.
2009-11-06T23:38:00.000Z	Pici	jimcooncat	We're talking about the pretty notification-daemon popups, not the applet.
2009-11-06T23:39:00.000Z	jimcooncat	Pici	Bryce1: my bad
2010-08-20T19:11:00.000Z	Pici	jimcooncat	tasksel --list-tasks, or run it with no arguments interactively
2010-08-20T19:11:00.000Z	jimcooncat	Pici	I don't have that up and running though
2010-08-20T19:12:00.000Z	Pici	jimcooncat	Heres the results on Lucid: http://pastebin.com/bZmPH4ef
2010-08-20T19:12:00.000Z	jimcooncat	Pici	I'm doing a pxe install and all I have is a very old install
2011-05-17T17:33:00.000Z	Pici	jimcooncat	sudo blkid
