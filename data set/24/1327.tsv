2011-08-12T23:18:00.000Z	Rehan	thunsucker	kv102t, thanks. I know how to do that step so this is a good sign! :P So after resizing the partition, how would i be able to choose between the two partitions?
2011-08-12T23:19:00.000Z	thunsucker	Rehan	normally you install win7 then linux, linux will load grub2 which will prompt you to boot to linux or win7
2011-08-12T23:19:00.000Z	thunsucker	Rehan	after you resize the partition, install win7 in the available space, when you boot it will only go to win7. once that works you will have to repair/reinstall grub2 so be able to boot to both, or something similiar to grub2
2011-08-12T23:20:00.000Z	thunsucker	Rehan	my suggestion, start from scratch. wipe the drive, install win7 on part of it, then install linux on the rest
2011-08-12T23:20:00.000Z	Rehan	thunsucker	this is all on a USB flash drive and I don't want to install Win7. I just want the ISO on there and have the ability to boot from the ISO or Ubuntu
2011-08-12T23:20:00.000Z	thunsucker	Rehan	when you boot from a win7 iso it will start the "windows installer" it won't be a live cd like ubuntu
2011-08-12T23:21:00.000Z	Rehan	thunsucker	yea, I don't want a live cd. just want the ability to install from it
2011-08-12T23:22:00.000Z	thunsucker	Rehan	as far as I know, you can't have a single usb stick that can boot and have the option to install win7 or ubuntu
2011-08-12T23:23:00.000Z	Rehan	thunsucker	it won't boot windows, only install windows. it will only boot ubuntu.
2011-08-12T23:23:00.000Z	Rehan	thunsucker	if that makes any sense lol
2011-08-12T23:26:00.000Z	thunsucker	Rehan	not for what you want, here is the link urlin2u found, it will be your best bet to get what you want working: http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=fr&u=http://liveusb.info/dotclear/&ei=0X1FTsarDqHjiAKWrt3fAQ&sa=X&oi=translate&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CF8Q7gEwAA&prev=/search%3Fq%3Dmultisystem%26hl%3Den%26sa%3DG%26site%3Dwebhp%26prmd%3Divns

2011-08-12T23:27:00.000Z	thunsucker	Rehan	there is no way to have a usb stick that has the options to boot a regular install of ubuntu or a win7 install
2011-08-12T23:27:00.000Z	thunsucker	Rehan	however you can have a usb stick that can be a ubuntu live cd or a win7 install
2011-08-12T23:33:00.000Z	thunsucker	Rehan	urlin2u provided a link that can get you 90% there
2011-08-12T23:53:00.000Z	Rehan	thunsucker	urlin2u and i politely disagreed about how hashes work. I was saying that if a Win7 ISO hash matches the hash of MSDN's official Win7 ISO, there's no way there can be trojans or backdoors in it. He disagreed.
2011-08-12T23:53:00.000Z	thunsucker	Rehan	you are wrong, i agree with him
2011-08-12T23:53:00.000Z	Rehan	thunsucker	I'm more than happy to be wrong, but could you explain it to me?
2011-08-12T23:54:00.000Z	thunsucker	Rehan	not to mention that there is a strong possibility that you're using a crack to make it work, which is another unsafe thing to do
2011-08-12T23:54:00.000Z	thunsucker	Rehan	i dont' argue or discuss topics of that n ature
2011-08-12T23:54:00.000Z	Rehan	thunsucker	no I have a key
2011-08-12T23:54:00.000Z	thunsucker	Rehan	stop bothering me
2011-08-12T23:56:00.000Z	Rehan	thunsucker	i am just trying to figure out if my concept of how hashes work is completely wrong since 2 people in here have now told me that if a hash matches it doesn't necessarily mean the two files are identical.
