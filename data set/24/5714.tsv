2006-09-27T12:10:00.000Z	LjL	scheuri	of course - having a computer connected itself *is* risky ;)
2006-09-27T12:10:00.000Z	LjL	scheuri	you're right, they don't. but they do tend to make users get better habits (like, for instance, not staying root all the time)
2006-09-27T12:11:00.000Z	scheuri	LjL	oh well...that is indeed true...;)...but well, can't help it anyway to connect that piece of plastic and silicon
2006-09-27T12:11:00.000Z	LjL	scheuri	i'm talking about myself, too, here -- on the box where i don't use sudo, i actually use root a lot more than i should. here, not.
2006-09-27T12:11:00.000Z	scheuri	LjL	there...I do absolutely agree
2006-10-19T09:18:00.000Z	LjL	scheuri	i've never dwelled much into those realms, but i think there are many viable options. however, i think you should find the reason why you can't boot from a hard driver, rather than just going for a workaround
2006-10-19T09:19:00.000Z	scheuri	LjL	well, I know...but it would be great by starting to boot the ubuntu installed on the disk...its just...the grub floopy I just made (using community docs) leaves me with the grub command line...and I dont know how to work with that...
2006-10-19T09:21:00.000Z	LjL	scheuri	the grub command line and I are not very good friends. but that link should have info
2006-10-19T09:21:00.000Z	scheuri	LjL	thousand thanks...:)....the cl of grub and me are not friends either...
2006-10-19T09:21:00.000Z	LjL	scheuri	in particular, i think you should see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto/BootFloppy
2006-10-19T09:23:00.000Z	scheuri	LjL	I actually did...I made that and have a floopy now that wonderfully works...but now I am ending up at "grub>" :)
2006-10-19T09:24:00.000Z	scheuri	LjL	would be great to have something like the Boot-CDs (alternate eg) which allows with a menu entry to "boot from the hard disk"...
2006-10-19T09:24:00.000Z	LjL	scheuri	the Desktop CD has that
2006-10-19T09:24:00.000Z	LjL	scheuri	however i think it just invokes your HD's Grub, which won't help you much if that's broken
2006-10-19T09:25:00.000Z	scheuri	LjL	that is actually the question...is it just the MBR whichis broken or the whole grub....
2006-10-19T09:25:00.000Z	LjL	scheuri	you could probably also use the Desktop CD to directly boot from a HD partition, if you press F6 (i think it is) and give it the right options... something on the lines of "linux root=/dev/hda".
2006-10-19T09:26:00.000Z	scheuri	LjL	that is where it gets difficult...for some reason the CD-Drive does not work anymore...:(...that is why I handle with floppies right now
2006-10-19T09:26:00.000Z	scheuri	LjL	once I should be able to boot in to the installed ubuntu I will make a special boot disk...but...well
2006-10-19T09:26:00.000Z	LjL	scheuri	well, what about you just try with "boot (hd0)"? not sure that's really the right syntax, but there is a "help" command anyway
2006-10-19T09:27:00.000Z	LjL	scheuri	or "boot (hd0,0)" or something, even, to boot the first partition where you conceivably have Ubuntu installed
2006-10-19T09:28:00.000Z	scheuri	LjL	just working on that...the command "boot" actually exists...but...well
2006-10-19T09:28:00.000Z	LjL	scheuri	yeah, that "boot" is a valid command, i was sure ;-) it's the rest of the syntax that i'm not entirely sure about
2006-10-19T09:29:00.000Z	scheuri	LjL	thanks a lot....I am looking into it...:)
