2008-02-09T05:53:00.000Z	genii	Woofcat	what partition are you booting to right now? Because normally that is already the sda1 one
2008-02-09T05:30:00.000Z	genii	Woofcat	No
2008-02-09T05:31:00.000Z	genii	Woofcat	If no cd then make a linux boot floppy, then use debootstrap from there. Lots of info on how to do it with debian
2008-02-09T05:32:00.000Z	Woofcat	genii	no devices outside of hdd and internets
2008-02-09T05:33:00.000Z	genii	Woofcat	How did you get ubuntu on it originally then? Or is it some eMachine or so
2008-02-09T05:33:00.000Z	Woofcat	genii	removing harddrive
2008-02-09T05:34:00.000Z	genii	Woofcat	The other computer. Does it also run linux?
2008-02-09T05:35:00.000Z	genii	Woofcat	Depends how much room you have
2008-02-09T05:39:00.000Z	genii	Woofcat	Then make another partition for debian (or resize the current one smaller and then use free space for new one). Boot to ubuntu. format the new partiton ext3. do chroot/debbootstrap method to new partition and put debian on it.

2008-02-09T05:43:00.000Z	genii	Woofcat	No, debbootstrap is like a minimal netinstall way.It will go grab everything from internet
