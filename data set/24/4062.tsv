2007-11-24T00:39:00.000Z	paradizelost	Creed	you click and type
2007-11-24T00:29:00.000Z	paradizelost	Creed	i recommend using webmin http://www.webmin.com
2007-11-24T00:31:00.000Z	Creed	paradizelost	that just gives me a gui to work with, im still clueless as to how to do it...
2007-11-24T00:31:00.000Z	paradizelost	Creed	you go into bind, and say "create zone"
2007-11-24T00:32:00.000Z	paradizelost	Creed	call the zone what you want, and create an "a" record for the www.name.com
2007-11-24T00:32:00.000Z	Creed	paradizelost	what do I use as nameservers on godaddy?
2007-11-24T00:32:00.000Z	paradizelost	Creed	oh, you want to do THAT. does your ISP allow you to run servers?
2007-11-24T00:32:00.000Z	paradizelost	Creed	do you have a static IP address from your ISP?
2007-11-24T00:33:00.000Z	Creed	paradizelost	yup, business package and I confirmed it with qwest. I have a static ip yes.
2007-11-24T00:33:00.000Z	paradizelost	Creed	honestly, i'd recommend having your dns hosted offsite, but if you insist, you tell godaddy your static ip address for the nameserver
2007-11-24T00:34:00.000Z	paradizelost	Creed	www.xname.org
2007-11-24T00:34:00.000Z	paradizelost	Creed	free offsite dns hosting
2007-11-24T00:34:00.000Z	paradizelost	Creed	i've had good luck with them
2007-11-24T00:34:00.000Z	Creed	paradizelost	it has to be a fqdn name, cant be IP's...which is giving me quite a lot of headaches. I would prefer to do it locally as I also want to do internal stuff with the domain so I want full control over it, with and without internet access.
2007-11-24T00:35:00.000Z	paradizelost	Creed	you can run an internal for your own stuff, and still have external for outside
2007-11-24T00:36:00.000Z	paradizelost	Creed	umm, they should take a full public static ip address as an FQDN
2007-11-24T00:36:00.000Z	Creed	paradizelost	hmm, ill try again...Don't I have to setup BIND to be a authoritive ns for the domain first or anything?
2007-11-24T00:36:00.000Z	paradizelost	Creed	if not, you need to register with dyndns.org, get yourself a name, and point it at you
2007-11-24T00:37:00.000Z	paradizelost	Creed	if you go through webmin, it's very straight forward
2007-11-24T00:38:00.000Z	Creed	paradizelost	any chance you could create the zone for me so I know how one I havent totally screwed up looks like? lol
2007-11-24T00:38:00.000Z	paradizelost	Creed	sorry, i DON"T run external zone's internally
2007-11-24T00:39:00.000Z	paradizelost	Creed	and as i said, if you do it with webmin, it is easy
2007-11-24T00:46:00.000Z	Creed	paradizelost	alright I got the zone made (thanks!). when I enter ns0.aschen.net as a nameserver in GoDaddy (doesn't accept IP's, has to be FQDN and an IP doesn't qualify as that), it errors out with "DNS server not registered"
2007-11-24T00:46:00.000Z	Creed	paradizelost	err "Nameserver not registered"
