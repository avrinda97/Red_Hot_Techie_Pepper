2008-01-11T18:40:00.000Z	dusty-sts		no its doing 1280x1024 but i want 1600x1200
2008-01-11T18:40:00.000Z	cwillu_	dusty-sts	one sec
2008-01-11T18:41:00.000Z	cwillu_	dusty-sts	with a big enough monitor :)
2008-01-11T18:41:00.000Z	cwillu_	dusty-sts	that's actually the limit for multiple monitors on the card as well
2008-01-11T18:42:00.000Z	cwillu_	dusty-sts	sorry, back up a tiny bit ;p
2008-01-11T18:42:00.000Z	cwillu_	dusty-sts	okay, to set the default resolution, add the resolution you want to the modes lines ("1600x1200@60" should work), and then set the preferred mode to "1600x1200"
2008-01-11T18:43:00.000Z	cwillu_	dusty-sts	you're using just the single video card right?
2008-01-11T18:44:00.000Z	cwillu_	dusty-sts	ya, just using the single card is preferable, in that acceleration isn't Not Trivial to set up across two cards even if they're identical
2008-01-11T18:44:00.000Z	cwillu_	dusty-sts	you can buy a dvi->vgi adapter for about 4-5 dollars
2008-01-11T18:45:00.000Z	cwillu_	dusty-sts	granted that that doesn't help you today, but it's a much simpler setup (i.e., the config file you have will work, wheras doing two video cards is much trickier)
2008-01-11T18:48:00.000Z	cwillu_	dusty-sts	pastebin me what you have for xorg.conf right now
2008-01-11T18:50:00.000Z	cwillu_	dusty-sts	my bad:  I'm not sure that video card will do dual 1600x1200+any other resolution and still have 3d acceleration.  That said, I forgot to tell you to change the Virtual line to match (just set it to 1600x1200)
2008-01-11T18:51:00.000Z	cwillu_	dusty-sts	1600 1200 rather (no x)
2008-01-11T18:53:00.000Z	cwillu_	dusty-sts	I haven't run any of the newer radeon's yet;  I'm not sure if the radeon driver supports it
2008-01-11T18:53:00.000Z	cwillu_	dusty-sts	if the radeon driver _does_ support it, it'll be basically the same file, just different resolutions to match the monitor
2008-01-11T18:54:00.000Z	cwillu_	dusty-sts	scrolling around? :p
2008-01-11T18:54:00.000Z	dusty-sts	cwillu_	when i boot to x its obviously 1600 x 1200, but the screen res gnome program thinks its 640x480
2008-01-11T18:55:00.000Z	cwillu_	dusty-sts	thought you might have been running into a virtual screen size thingy
2008-01-11T18:55:00.000Z	cwillu_	dusty-sts	I don't think there's much you can do about that;  the gnome config doesn't yet understand how radeon's do accelerated multi-head
2008-01-11T18:56:00.000Z	dusty-sts	cwillu_	so when i want to get it working with two monitors what not i just purely edit the file?
2008-01-11T18:56:00.000Z	cwillu_	dusty-sts	which is a nuisance for hot plugging monitors on a laptop for instance, because you _need_ to use xrandr to set it up instead of a nice and easy gui
2008-01-11T18:56:00.000Z	cwillu_	dusty-sts	pretty much;  virtual needs to be the total size
2008-01-11T18:56:00.000Z	dusty-sts	cwillu_	well thankyou VERY much for your help.
2008-01-11T18:57:00.000Z	cwillu_	dusty-sts	do you remember who the last person I was talking to was?  the printer guy?  he went off the top of my scrollback :(
