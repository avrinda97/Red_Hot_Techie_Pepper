2007-01-03T06:51:00.000Z	Chousuke	kitche	the language? o
2007-01-03T06:52:00.000Z	Chousuke	kitche	what do you mean with "open source language"?
2007-01-03T06:54:00.000Z	kitche	Chousuke	BULLE: the java language is still under license of JCP
2007-01-03T06:55:00.000Z	Chousuke	kitche	what do you mean with the "Java language"?
2007-01-03T06:55:00.000Z	Chousuke	kitche	you can create your own version of Java if you want.
2007-01-03T06:55:00.000Z	Chousuke	kitche	Java the language that is, not the VM implementation
2007-01-03T06:56:00.000Z	kitche	Chousuke	Java is a programming language which is under JCP still according to Sun due to 3rd party property
2007-01-03T06:56:00.000Z	Chousuke	kitche	how can a programming language be under some licence?
2007-01-03T06:56:00.000Z	Chousuke	kitche	I can understand if libraries are.
2007-01-03T07:04:00.000Z	kitche	Chousuke	well it'll be hard without the API and the specifications being open sourced
2007-01-03T07:04:00.000Z	Chousuke	kitche	err?
2007-01-03T07:04:00.000Z	Chousuke	kitche	the whole VM is open source. and the libraries.
2007-01-03T07:05:00.000Z	kitche	Chousuke	you mean the classpath's and no they aren't open source
2007-01-03T07:05:00.000Z	Chousuke	kitche	er, weren't they open sourced just recently?
2007-01-03T07:09:00.000Z	kitche	Chousuke	according to sun.com/software/opensource/java/faq.jsp the classpath's are under GPL exemption which means that they are not GPL licensed
2007-01-03T07:09:00.000Z	Chousuke	kitche	hmmh
2007-01-03T07:10:00.000Z	Chousuke	kitche	it seems to me that it only talks about the specs. ie. the documentation.
2007-01-03T07:10:00.000Z	Chousuke	kitche	so you have the source code, which is GPL
2007-01-03T07:10:00.000Z	Chousuke	kitche	and you can look at it and document it yourself.
2007-01-03T07:10:00.000Z	Chousuke	kitche	but sun is not helping you it seems.
2007-01-03T07:10:00.000Z	kitche	Chousuke	well I m looking at the faq
2007-01-03T07:12:00.000Z	kitche	Chousuke	the libraries was always open sourced just not GPL'd
2007-01-03T07:13:00.000Z	Chousuke	kitche	right. but making them GPL is quite an improvement.
