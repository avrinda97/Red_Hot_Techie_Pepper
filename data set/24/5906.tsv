2007-02-12T14:26:00.000Z	Aggrav8d		hello, all.
2007-02-12T14:28:00.000Z	Aggrav8d		Recently i had to change my server name to make https work.  now my samba is all screwy and the server shows up as "marginallyclever server (Samba, Ubuntu) (MARGINALLYCLEVE)" even though the netbios name is "HAL".  the server name is marginallyclever.com.  wtf is going on and how do i get it back to HAL without breaking things?
2007-02-12T14:28:00.000Z	Poromenos	Aggrav8d	see /etc/smb.conf
2007-02-12T14:28:00.000Z	Poromenos	Aggrav8d	the name is in there, edit that and change the naem
2007-02-12T14:29:00.000Z	Aggrav8d	Poromenos	- i have been.  the name there is HAL.
2007-02-12T14:29:00.000Z	Poromenos	Aggrav8d	restarted it?
2007-02-12T14:29:00.000Z	Aggrav8d	Poromenos	- oh yeah
2007-02-12T14:30:00.000Z	Poromenos	Aggrav8d	that's very odd, that's the place you should edit
2007-02-12T14:30:00.000Z	Poromenos	Aggrav8d	i don't know what else to say, maybe the line exists twice?
2007-02-12T14:30:00.000Z	Aggrav8d	Poromenos	- i've tried talking to #samba for the last 45 minutes, they were no help.
2007-02-12T14:30:00.000Z	Poromenos	Aggrav8d	search the file for server
2007-02-12T14:30:00.000Z	Poromenos	Aggrav8d	hmm, can you paste the file on a pastebin?
2007-02-12T14:36:00.000Z	Poromenos	Aggrav8d	change "server string = %h server (Samba, Ubuntu)" to "server string = HAL" or whatever you want it to be
2007-02-12T14:36:00.000Z	Poromenos	Aggrav8d	then restart samba
2007-02-12T14:37:00.000Z	Aggrav8d	Poromenos	- i'll try it
2007-02-12T14:37:00.000Z	Poromenos	Aggrav8d	it'll work :p
2007-02-12T14:38:00.000Z	Aggrav8d	Poromenos	- did it but the name still shows up wrong in windows.  is there some way to force windows to refresh?
2007-02-12T14:38:00.000Z	Poromenos	Aggrav8d	well, you can reboot, or repair the network i think
2007-02-12T14:38:00.000Z	Poromenos	Aggrav8d	 make sure you restarted samba
2007-02-12T14:38:00.000Z	Poromenos	Aggrav8d	but on next windows boot, it'll show up as HAL
2007-02-12T14:39:00.000Z	Poromenos	Aggrav8d	could you log on the server before?
2007-02-12T14:40:00.000Z	Poromenos	Aggrav8d	does it ask for a username and password?
2007-02-12T14:41:00.000Z	Poromenos	Aggrav8d	hmm, that's odd, nothing else has changed
2007-02-12T14:41:00.000Z	Poromenos	Aggrav8d	windows probably doesn't recognise the server now and doesn't send the password
