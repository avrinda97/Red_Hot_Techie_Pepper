2005-04-26T14:34:00.000Z	Jimbob	int0x	"gksudo users-admin"
2005-04-26T14:34:00.000Z	Jimbob	int0x	Assuming your user is in /etc/sudoers
2005-04-26T14:36:00.000Z	Jimbob	int0x	Is your user in /etc/sudoers?
2005-04-26T14:37:00.000Z	Jimbob	int0x	1.) Relax, you'll live longer :-)
2005-04-26T14:38:00.000Z	Jimbob	int0x	The user that was created when you installed ubuntu should be in sudoers.
2005-04-26T14:39:00.000Z	Jimbob	int0x	Ok, so reboot into single-user mode and add your user to /etc/sudoers (the "root" line should work as a template)
2005-04-26T14:39:00.000Z	int0x	Jimbob	what is single-user mode
2005-04-26T14:43:00.000Z	Jimbob	int0x	There should be a line in there "root ALL=(ALL)" or something like that
2005-04-26T14:43:00.000Z	Jimbob	int0x	Yep
2005-04-26T14:44:00.000Z	Jimbob	int0x	"visudo" is a little app to safely edit the sudoers file.
2005-04-26T14:44:00.000Z	Jimbob	int0x	If you've already done it, that's fine.
2005-04-26T14:44:00.000Z	Jimbob	int0x	"visudo" will use whatever editor you specify.
2005-04-26T14:46:00.000Z	Jimbob	int0x	No
2005-04-26T14:54:00.000Z	Jimbob	int0x	Totem is pretty nice
2005-04-26T15:01:00.000Z	Jimbob	int0x	For MP3 playback, all you need to install is "gstreamer0.8-mad", from the universe repository
2005-04-26T15:01:00.000Z	Jimbob	int0x	As per sec. 6.1 on the formats page.
