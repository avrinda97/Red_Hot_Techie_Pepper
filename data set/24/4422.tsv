2010-08-03T18:00:00.000Z	neo__		hi!i have a problem with the wi-fi connection. every time i use Transmission, after a while the connection goes down, has someone else had the same problem? (i use ubuntu 10.04 LTS)
2010-08-03T18:00:00.000Z	magnetron	neo__	do you happen to use a home router?
2010-08-03T18:01:00.000Z	magnetron	neo__	do you happen to use a router?
2010-08-03T18:01:00.000Z	neo__	magnetron	yes
2010-08-03T18:03:00.000Z	magnetron	neo__	it's probably a problem with your router, bittorrent generates alot of connections and some routers will crash if they get too many
2010-08-03T18:04:00.000Z	magnetron	neo__	in some routers it's a setting of "maximum connections". others needs to be flashed with an alternative firmware, and some others can't be used for bittorrent
2010-08-03T18:08:00.000Z	neo__	magnetron	but when i used windows XP it didn't give me troubles. so i thought about a library error or something similar
2010-08-03T18:11:00.000Z	magnetron	neo__	well, you haven't given anymore info so router problems is the most likely cause here
2010-08-03T18:13:00.000Z	neo__	magnetron	actually, you're right. but in the system log there's nothing. only one time it logged something about /build/buildd/linux-2.6.32/net/mac80211/tx.c
2010-08-03T18:14:00.000Z	neo__	magnetron	and the relative call trace
2010-08-03T18:15:00.000Z	magnetron	neo__	wait, you are torrenting via wifi? you didn't tell me
2010-08-03T18:15:00.000Z	neo__	magnetron	yes
2010-08-03T18:16:00.000Z	neo__	magnetron	i saved the log with the call trace but i dont't kwnow who to send it to
2010-08-03T18:16:00.000Z	magnetron	neo__	there are a millions of reasons your wifi could go down. for instance, some other wifi user could be using an overlapping frequency
2010-08-03T18:18:00.000Z	neo__	magnetron	if this is a problem that would stand also with windows so i don't think because this problem issued only with ubuntu
2010-08-03T18:19:00.000Z	neo__	magnetron	before instead, the screen became black and i was forced to switch it off pushing the button
2010-08-03T18:20:00.000Z	neo__	magnetron	that's why i thought about a kernel errore
2010-08-03T18:20:00.000Z	magnetron	neo__	i thought you said your network went down
2010-08-03T18:20:00.000Z	neo__	magnetron	recently yes
2010-08-03T18:21:00.000Z	neo__	magnetron	maybe that error was fix in a kernel update, but now there's another one
2010-08-03T18:22:00.000Z	neo__	magnetron	*was fixed
2010-08-03T18:25:00.000Z	neo__	magnetron	who can i send the kernel trace to?
2010-08-03T18:30:00.000Z	neo__	magnetron	i go, thank a lot for your time. bye
2010-08-03T18:30:00.000Z	neo__	magnetron	+thanks
