2011-07-04T19:10:00.000Z	soscrewed		damnit
2011-07-04T19:12:00.000Z	tntc	soscrewed	there's not much you can do about that other than go and buy a 1TB drive
2011-07-04T19:13:00.000Z	tntc	soscrewed	but if you REALLY need everything from it, I've had really good luck with R-Studio for recovery.
2011-07-04T19:13:00.000Z	tntc	soscrewed	also, how big is the original drive? I know it has 1TB of data, but what is it, a 2TB drive?
2011-07-04T19:13:00.000Z	soscrewed	tntc	true but i was able to recover the boot sector, but when i mounted it it dmesg a bunch of crap about invalid, so i found another tool fsck.msdos that says it should restore the errors but this truncating thing has me freaked out
2011-07-04T19:14:00.000Z	soscrewed	tntc	it's a 1 TB with 1 TB on it
2011-07-04T19:18:00.000Z	tntc	soscrewed	then you can use gddrescue or dd_rescue to copy the disk (using an ubuntu liveCD or whatever)
2011-07-04T19:18:00.000Z	tntc	soscrewed	perform no further operations on the damaged disk. you'll only make it worse.
2011-07-04T19:19:00.000Z	soscrewed	tntc	i have no choice at the moment, this fsck.msdos i ran it half hour ago and i'm not about to stop it for fear of what that might do
2011-07-04T19:19:00.000Z	tntc	soscrewed	disconnect the hard disk
2011-07-04T19:19:00.000Z	tntc	soscrewed	the longer it runs the worse it'll go
2011-07-04T19:20:00.000Z	soscrewed	tntc	i don't know, i read a webpage about a guy with the same error and this worked for him
2011-07-04T19:20:00.000Z	tntc	soscrewed	he got lucky. if your disk is even slightly damaged, you're making it worse, and could kill it
2011-07-04T19:21:00.000Z	tntc	soscrewed	if this is THAT IMPORTANT to you, a year of your life, get another hard disk, and use dd_rescue or somethign to make a duplicate. That way, you don't have to worry about hardware dying in the middle.
2011-07-04T19:21:00.000Z	soscrewed	tntc	well even though it says it's truncating, i went back into testdisk and went under the undelete and all the files it says truncating are still there and aren't 0 bytes in size
2011-07-04T19:22:00.000Z	soscrewed	tntc	sorry for the confusion
2011-07-04T19:22:00.000Z	tntc	soscrewed	make. a copy. of. the disk.
2011-07-04T19:22:00.000Z	soscrewed	tntc	i can't it's too big
2011-07-04T19:22:00.000Z	tntc	soscrewed	go buy another disk. it's worth the money
2011-07-04T19:23:00.000Z	soscrewed	tntc	:3
2011-07-04T19:24:00.000Z	tntc	soscrewed	I'm telling you dude, if you want your data, don't trust that disk. Go spent $100 and get a new hard drive to copy the data to, or you risk losing it all.
2011-07-04T19:25:00.000Z	tntc	soscrewed	once your stuff is off the disk, then you can worry about whether or not the old disk is ok
2011-07-04T19:25:00.000Z	tntc	soscrewed	I know it sucks to go and have to drop $100 on a disk, but the fact is, 1 year of your stuff is probably worth it
2011-07-04T19:28:00.000Z	tntc	soscrewed	the more you mess with the FS, the more likely it is that you'll lose it all
