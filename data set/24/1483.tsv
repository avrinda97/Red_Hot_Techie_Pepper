2010-10-15T02:08:00.000Z	hsr	phisher1	I pressed Ctrl+Alt+F1 and went to tty1. So I should try startx.. right?
2010-10-15T02:08:00.000Z	phisher1	hsr	are you already in an X session ?
2010-10-15T02:09:00.000Z	hsr	phisher1	I don't know.. cannot say
2010-10-15T02:11:00.000Z	hsr	phisher1	Yes... Thanks :) What was it?
