2010-09-15T01:51:00.000Z	csmith1994		k guys I need some help, I need processing for my programming class. but whenever I run processing and try and run a simple process, it crashes my pc. what should I do
2010-09-15T01:53:00.000Z	Ilay	csmith1994	do you mean that your program crasges your linux kernel?
2010-09-15T01:54:00.000Z	csmith1994	Ilay	yes, when I run processing, and run a simple program that just changes the size of the window and a background color, it flashes off and back on instantly at the boot screen
2010-09-15T01:57:00.000Z	Ilay	csmith1994	can you check your /var/log/kern.log* files for information about what happened?
2010-09-15T01:58:00.000Z	csmith1994	Ilay	will do
2010-09-15T01:58:00.000Z	Ilay	csmith1994	as I understand you ran your selwriten program?
2010-09-15T01:59:00.000Z	csmith1994	Ilay	yes, the code was in the simplified java used by Processing, and said: size (640,480); background (255,0,0)
2010-09-15T02:00:00.000Z	Ilay	csmith1994	may be the problem is in video card driver...
2010-09-15T02:00:00.000Z	csmith1994	Ilay	i ran a video card check last night  do you want me so send you the output of lspci | grep vga
2010-09-15T02:01:00.000Z	Ilay	csmith1994	no, just ask about that issue in java programmers channel I think
2010-09-15T02:02:00.000Z	csmith1994	Ilay	I don't believe that's the issue though, and what's the java programmers channel
2010-09-15T02:03:00.000Z	Ilay	csmith1994	it's no a regular program crash cuz when the kernel is crashed it means that it's realy serious problem and may be you should write bug report to kernel developers team
2010-09-15T02:03:00.000Z	csmith1994	Ilay	I don't know if the kernel crashes, it simply reboots.
2010-09-15T02:03:00.000Z	csmith1994	Ilay	without the usual shutdown step lol
2010-09-15T02:04:00.000Z	Ilay	csmith1994	just check log files for any kernel crash reports
2010-09-15T02:05:00.000Z	csmith1994	Ilay	How do I search the kernel log just use ctrl+F?
2010-09-15T02:06:00.000Z	Ilay	csmith1994	it depends on which text editor you r using, you can use grep command for searching substrings in files too
2010-09-15T02:06:00.000Z	csmith1994	Ilay	I opened it in gedit
2010-09-15T02:07:00.000Z	Ilay	csmith1994	how do you programming if you don't know how to searsh text in files?
2010-09-15T02:08:00.000Z	csmith1994	Ilay	I'm taking a course, and downloading it as a course requirement
2010-09-15T02:08:00.000Z	Ilay	csmith1994	what linux distribution/version do you use?
2010-09-15T02:09:00.000Z	csmith1994	Ilay	Ubuntu Karmic (10.04)
2010-09-15T02:10:00.000Z	Ilay	csmith1994	just send crash report tot ubuntu developers
2010-09-15T02:11:00.000Z	csmith1994	Ilay	ok, for now I'll just run it on winblows on my family PC until it's developed properly. Apparently, my teacher had no problem running older versions on his ubuntu machine, but idk what version of ubuntu he was running
