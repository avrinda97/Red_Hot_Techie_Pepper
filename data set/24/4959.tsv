2007-03-03T07:56:00.000Z	shadwan		sorry about repeating myself: i have 25% of my hard drive taken up by xp and i don't want that shit any more. i just installed gparted, but right-clicking on the ntfs windows partition doesn't give me any options. i want to keep all the stuff on my ext3 partition.  ??
2007-03-03T07:58:00.000Z	eck	shadwan	is xp at the beginning or end of the partition?
2007-03-03T07:59:00.000Z	shadwan	eck	first on the list in gparted. and on the graphic.
2007-03-03T08:00:00.000Z	eck	shadwan	just to let you know, you won't be able to grow the ext3 partition into that space, you'll have to create a new ext3 partition
2007-03-03T08:00:00.000Z	eck	shadwan	if its not mounted you can just use mkfs
2007-03-03T08:00:00.000Z	shadwan	eck	ok. thanks. i suspected as much. i guess a fresh install will be a blessing in a way. thanks for the help!
2007-03-03T08:01:00.000Z	shadwan	eck	mkfs?
2007-03-03T08:01:00.000Z	eck	shadwan	you aren't using lvm, are you?
2007-03-03T08:01:00.000Z	eck	shadwan	um, something like this: mkfs.ext3 -j /dev/hda1
2007-03-03T08:02:00.000Z	shadwan	eck	that's greek to me. i installed ubuntu and xp, i'm running kde. that's all i know. useless, i'm sure.
2007-03-03T08:02:00.000Z	eck	shadwan	well i suspect you aren't, but if you were using lvm it would be possible to merge two partitions into a single space
2007-03-03T08:03:00.000Z	eck	shadwan	if you reinstall, consider splitting out the install into at least a / and /home partition
2007-03-03T08:03:00.000Z	eck	shadwan	that way you can reinstall/upgrade easily in the future without worrying about losing data
2007-03-03T08:03:00.000Z	shadwan	eck	tell you what. answer me this: with a fresh install, how should i go about installing kde without the HUGE number of unneccessary programs? i installed it over gnome and it appears...bloated.
2007-03-03T08:04:00.000Z	eck	shadwan	i think there is a kubuntu install disc
2007-03-03T08:04:00.000Z	shadwan	eck	and i will certainly look up the forums on splitting up the home partition as you say
2007-03-03T08:06:00.000Z	shadwan	eck	does the kubuntu install disc ( i have a fairly recent one somewhere ) include the same baggage as doing "apt-get install kde" on edgy ubuntu?
2007-03-03T08:06:00.000Z	eck	shadwan	you will not get the things in ubuntu-desktop that aren't in kubuntu-desktop, i.e. all of the gnome stuff
2007-03-03T08:13:00.000Z	eck	shadwan	then you should definitely use a separate /home partition!
2007-03-03T08:13:00.000Z	eck	shadwan	it lets you keep /home intact if you do a new install
2007-03-03T08:14:00.000Z	shadwan	eck	i will certainly try. first i need to get some dvds to back up my massive film and music collection to! oh. are you saying there is something i can do to keep my CURRENT data intact?
2007-03-03T08:14:00.000Z	shadwan	eck	or from afresh?
2007-03-03T08:15:00.000Z	eck	shadwan	you might reformat the xp partition, make it into something like /data, copy your things there, and then not reformat that when you reinstall. it sort of depends if that's a good allocation of space for you ornot
2007-03-03T08:16:00.000Z	shadwan	eck	aha. i think i'll spend a few quid and back stuff up and start anew. the ratios that i've allocated to xp/ubuntu have been arbitrary, so i'd rather do it all fresh.
