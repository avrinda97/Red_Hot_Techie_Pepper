2010-10-30T10:47:00.000Z	BlackJamMan	ActionParsnip	I think you mean me.
2010-10-30T10:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	BlackJamMan	yeah, it's been a long shift :(
2010-10-30T10:48:00.000Z	BlackJamMan	ActionParsnip	Can I install it myself locally ?
2010-10-30T10:48:00.000Z	BlackJamMan	ActionParsnip	Or would the admin have to
2010-10-30T10:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	BlackJamMan	sure, just run: sudo apt-get install mutt
2010-10-30T10:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	BlackJamMan	only members of admin can install packages
2010-10-30T10:49:00.000Z	BlackJamMan	ActionParsnip	I don't have the root pass.
2010-10-30T10:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	BlackJamMan	there isn't one
2010-10-30T10:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	BlackJamMan	if you run: groups   are you a member of admin?
2010-10-30T10:49:00.000Z	BlackJamMan	ActionParsnip	no.  It's not my 'box'
2010-10-30T10:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	BlackJamMan	i see, then the owner will need to set it up for you
2010-10-30T10:49:00.000Z	BlackJamMan	ActionParsnip	but there is no mail or pine.  He removed it for some reason and I can't figure out how to read my mail
2010-10-30T10:50:00.000Z	BlackJamMan	ActionParsnip	I get "you have new mail" on login, but no way to read it I know of
2010-10-30T10:51:00.000Z	BlackJamMan	ActionParsnip	So I have to wait on him pretty much ?
2010-10-30T10:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	BlackJamMan	yes as you do not have access to instal things
2010-10-30T10:53:00.000Z	BlackJamMan	ActionParsnip	I can't even run mutt as a user after ./configire
2010-10-30T10:53:00.000Z	BlackJamMan		and make
2010-10-30T10:54:00.000Z	BlackJamMan	ActionParsnip	well even that wont work due to no 'curses'
2010-10-30T10:54:00.000Z	BlackJamMan		oh well
2010-10-30T10:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	BlackJamMan	you can compile and run the command from where it stands, you will not be able to run 'make install'
2010-10-30T10:55:00.000Z	BlackJamMan	ActionParsnip	It wont even work due to no curses.
2010-10-30T10:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	BlackJamMan	you MAY be able to download the deb, extract it to $HOME then execute it there, it may work
2010-10-30T10:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	BlackJamMan	i see
