2009-10-07T07:58:00.000Z	evon		can anyone please help me set up an ftp server?
2009-10-07T07:59:00.000Z	frogfoo	evon	did you try these instructions? https://help.ubuntu.com/6.06/ubuntu/serverguide/C/ftp-server.html
2009-10-07T07:59:00.000Z	frogfoo	evon	guess they're pretty old, but ftp servers probably haven't changed much...
2009-10-07T07:59:00.000Z	evon	frogfoo	i will check it out. does it have a gui?
2009-10-07T08:00:00.000Z	frogfoo	evon	i doubt it. most servers do not.
2009-10-07T08:00:00.000Z	evon	frogfoo	that sucks. I'm not that good and commandline
2009-10-07T08:00:00.000Z	frogfoo	evon	don't worry, you'll learn by doing.
2009-10-07T08:04:00.000Z	evon	frogfoo	so i followed the instructions and started the daemon so how to i allow someone to dowload my files?
2009-10-07T08:04:00.000Z	frogfoo	evon	you need to put your files in the right place, so that vsftpd can find them
2009-10-07T08:05:00.000Z	evon	frogfoo	why can't i just tell the program where to get them?
2009-10-07T08:06:00.000Z	frogfoo	evon	yes, that would work too
2009-10-07T08:25:00.000Z	evon	frogfoo	question for you
2009-10-07T08:06:00.000Z	evon	frogfoo	ok I am reading the config file now to see if I can tell it where to get the files but I still have know idea how to have someone connect to it
2009-10-07T08:07:00.000Z	frogfoo	evon	ok. i reckon you want to look for the anon_root config option in that file
2009-10-07T08:07:00.000Z	frogfoo	evon	once that's set up, hopefully you can tell people to put ftp://<your-ip-address-here>/ into firefox
2009-10-07T08:08:00.000Z	frogfoo	evon	there are potential firewall/networking snags that depend on exactly how you're connected to the internet
2009-10-07T08:08:00.000Z	evon	frogfoo	ok you mind trying it for me if i send you the info?
2009-10-07T08:08:00.000Z	frogfoo	evon	rightho
2009-10-07T08:25:00.000Z	frogfoo	evon	mm
2009-10-07T08:26:00.000Z	frogfoo	evon	well, you're asking the question backwards
2009-10-07T08:27:00.000Z	evon	frogfoo	how so?
2009-10-07T08:27:00.000Z	frogfoo	evon	you mean: can I chmod a directory so that i can still write to it, but others cannot
2009-10-07T08:27:00.000Z	frogfoo	evon	answer: yes
2009-10-07T08:27:00.000Z	evon	frogfoo	thanks
