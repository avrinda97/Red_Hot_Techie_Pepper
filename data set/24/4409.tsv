2007-04-22T08:22:00.000Z	xtknight		feisty feels more stable than edgy to me
2007-04-22T08:22:00.000Z	xtknight		i couldnt really think of what could be better, honesly
2007-04-22T08:22:00.000Z	Blubloblu	xtknight	not at all to me, ive had only problems with feisty
2007-04-22T08:23:00.000Z	xtknight	Blubloblu	such as?
2007-04-22T08:23:00.000Z	Blubloblu	xtknight	hard drive partition mount problems, nvidia drivers not working anymore, wireless usb adaptor not working
2007-04-22T08:23:00.000Z	xtknight	Blubloblu	clean install or upgrade?
2007-04-22T08:24:00.000Z	xtknight	Blubloblu	that could be your problem.  feisty uses different facilities than edgy in some cases.  for example, libata is now used for IDE.  and i dont think in the upgrade the fstab is updated..
2007-04-22T08:24:00.000Z	Blubloblu	xtknight	the hard drive problem is fixed, but now my drivers and xorg.conf are messed up
2007-04-22T08:25:00.000Z	xtknight	Blubloblu	have you tried the restricted driver manager?
2007-04-22T08:25:00.000Z	xtknight	Blubloblu	youre on feisty now, right?
