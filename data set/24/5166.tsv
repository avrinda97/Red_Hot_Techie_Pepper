2006-12-07T14:32:00.000Z	reverie		hey guys
2006-12-07T14:32:00.000Z	reverie		*tips hat*
2006-12-07T14:32:00.000Z	reverie		can anyone advice me on a fresh install of edgy?
2006-12-07T14:33:00.000Z	reverie		i have windows on sda1, i'm installing ubuntu on sdb1
2006-12-07T14:33:00.000Z	reverie		i assume, when it wants to install grub on hd0 that will overrite my xp mbr
2006-12-07T14:33:00.000Z	reverie		so should i rather use hd1 ?
2006-12-07T14:34:00.000Z	reverie		yeah but i don't wanna touch the xp drive
2006-12-07T14:34:00.000Z	reverie		'd rather tell the bios to boot off the second drive
2006-12-07T14:35:00.000Z	reverie		so hd1 := sdb ?
2006-12-07T14:35:00.000Z	savvas	reverie	does your motherboard support choosing hard disk boot order? i.e. pressing F11 and choosing from which hard disk to boot?
2006-12-07T14:35:00.000Z	reverie		yeah
2006-12-07T14:36:00.000Z	reverie		hmz
2006-12-07T14:36:00.000Z	reverie		at the moment my primary sata drive is the xp disk
2006-12-07T14:36:00.000Z	reverie		i'm new to sata in linux
2006-12-07T14:36:00.000Z	savvas	reverie	here's what i did.. i removed the sata drive of windows xp, installed ubuntu on the other sata drive, all worked well. then reconnected the xp drive, and simply press F11 to choose if i want it to boot from the drive containing xp, or the other drive containing ubuntu
2006-12-07T14:37:00.000Z	reverie		that's what i usually do
2006-12-07T14:37:00.000Z	reverie	Atlas95	loud and clear :D
2006-12-07T14:37:00.000Z	savvas		well it's the easiest way how you wouldn't touch the mbr of the xp drive
2006-12-07T14:37:00.000Z	reverie		well i'm gonna try hd1 isntead of hd0 (default)
2006-12-07T14:37:00.000Z	reverie		i can always repair the mbr
2006-12-07T14:39:00.000Z	savvas		!compiz
2006-12-07T14:39:00.000Z	reverie		can't wait to feel linux on my core 2 duo :D
2006-12-07T14:39:00.000Z	reverie		pitty there's no creative xfi support yet :(
2006-12-07T14:39:00.000Z	savvas	reverie	make that 'pheel' :p
