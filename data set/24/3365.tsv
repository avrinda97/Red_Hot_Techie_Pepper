2008-02-21T06:32:00.000Z	mbrush		anyone know of an online database of xorg.conf files and associated monitors and vid cards?
2008-02-21T06:34:00.000Z	jmdc	mbrush	I don't think such a database exists; do you need help configuring X?
2008-02-21T06:34:00.000Z	mbrush	jmdc	i do ... I've tried everything google has to offer
2008-02-21T06:35:00.000Z	jmdc	mbrush	well, you're in the right place to ask for help :-)
2008-02-21T06:35:00.000Z	mbrush	jmdc	unfortunately i think it may be hardware specific
2008-02-21T06:36:00.000Z	jmdc	mbrush	that's a somewhat exotic resolution; you're certain your display supports it?
2008-02-21T06:37:00.000Z	mbrush	jmdc	I am not sure if the vid card supports it, but it's the monitors native res
2008-02-21T06:37:00.000Z	jmdc	mbrush	- okay. What video card are you using?
2008-02-21T06:37:00.000Z	mbrush	jmdc	ATI AIW 8500DV
2008-02-21T06:40:00.000Z	mbrush	jmdc	pretty sure I've been through that one, but I'll give it another read
2008-02-21T06:42:00.000Z	jmdc	mbrush	would you put your xorg.conf file in the pastebin please?
2008-02-21T06:42:00.000Z	mbrush	jmdc	it's so hacked apart at this point, it's not worth posting, also it's on another computer with nothing but X
2008-02-21T06:43:00.000Z	mbrush	jmdc	I've not really tinkered with modelines so I'll have a stab at it, it's working on my other computer no prob
2008-02-21T06:43:00.000Z	jmdc	mbrush	I think it is worth posting, especially if it's hacked apart. That might be your problem ;-(
2008-02-21T06:44:00.000Z	mbrush	jmdc	then I gotta install firefox or something to pastebin it
2008-02-21T06:48:00.000Z	jmdc	mbrush	- is installing firefox a problem?
2008-02-21T06:49:00.000Z	mbrush	jmdc	no not really, I was just not wanting to install the extra 30MB
2008-02-21T06:53:00.000Z	mbrush	jmdc	xterm doesn't do copy?
2008-02-21T06:53:00.000Z	jmdc	mbrush	- try selecting text, then middle clicking
2008-02-21T06:54:00.000Z	mbrush	jmdc	ah
2008-02-21T06:54:00.000Z	jmdc	mbrush	- well, it works for me
2008-02-21T06:55:00.000Z	mbrush	jmdc	it launches the now installed fifefox to this page: http://www.libhunspell-1.1-0/
2008-02-21T06:57:00.000Z	mbrush	jmdc	wierdest thing ever, I just middle clicked xterm and it started installing something automatically in the background downloading stuff from ubuntu
2008-02-21T06:58:00.000Z	jmdc	mbrush	- middle click pastes whatever was last selected. whatever was last selected was a install command with a newline
