2005-05-08T08:56:00.000Z	ThomasWinwood		I'm attempting to set up WiFi access on my Ubuntu system and am having trouble because the network requires a WEP key which no facilities seem to support (it's thirteen bytes hex). Could anyone suggest anything short of deliberately removing WEP from the network?
2005-05-08T08:57:00.000Z	ivoks	ThomasWinwood	network-admin
2005-05-08T08:57:00.000Z	ThomasWinwood	ivoks	Eh?
2005-05-08T08:58:00.000Z	ivoks	ThomasWinwood	network-admin supports WEP.. acctually iwconfig supports WEP
2005-05-08T09:01:00.000Z	ThomasWinwood	ivoks	network-admin doesn't offer any options at all for wireless, and iwconfig gives me "Operation not supported" when eth0 is up and "Invalid argument" when down.
2005-05-08T09:01:00.000Z	ivoks	ThomasWinwood	it does
2005-05-08T09:01:00.000Z	ivoks	ThomasWinwood	run iwconfig
2005-05-08T09:02:00.000Z	ivoks	ThomasWinwood	i run wifi with WEP on ubuntu linux and i used netwrok-admin to set up network
2005-05-08T09:02:00.000Z	ThomasWinwood	ivoks	I already tried iwconfig a dozen times or more. "Operation not supported" when up, "Invalid argument" when down.
