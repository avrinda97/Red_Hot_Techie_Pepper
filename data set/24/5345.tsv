2006-08-11T14:42:00.000Z	el_isma		Indeed :)
2006-08-11T14:43:00.000Z	el_isma		c'mon tigerx...
2006-08-11T14:44:00.000Z	sanmarcos	el_isma	ubuntu just pull stuff from unstable
2006-08-11T14:45:00.000Z	el_isma	sanmarcos	his options were testing and ubuntu... feels like a small quiz XD
2006-08-11T14:46:00.000Z	el_isma	sanmarcos	I don't think that's true anymore
2006-08-11T14:46:00.000Z	el_isma	sanmarcos	From what I've heard, debian testing/unstable has been catching up to ubuntu and friends
2006-08-11T14:53:00.000Z	el_isma	sanmarcos	the console is there, if you want it...
2006-08-11T14:53:00.000Z	sanmarcos	el_isma	like in Os X
2006-08-11T14:54:00.000Z	el_isma	sanmarcos	maybe, but I think you'd agree that OsX has more polish
2006-08-11T14:54:00.000Z	sanmarcos	el_isma	nobody opens the terminal in os x, except literates
2006-08-11T14:59:00.000Z	sanmarcos	el_isma	it doesnt matter XP has a firewall
2006-08-11T14:59:00.000Z	sanmarcos	el_isma	microsoft != insecure
2006-08-11T14:59:00.000Z	el_isma	sanmarcos	!!
2006-08-11T14:59:00.000Z	sanmarcos	el_isma	just as linux != secure
2006-08-11T15:00:00.000Z	el_isma	sanmarcos	yeah, but... XP default firewall doesn't seem safe...
2006-08-11T15:00:00.000Z	sanmarcos	el_isma	ubuntu has no firewall by default
2006-08-11T15:00:00.000Z	sanmarcos	el_isma	you have to setup iptables by yourself, or use firestarter, or any gui tools
2006-08-11T15:01:00.000Z	el_isma	sanmarcos	but if you're using it as masquerade (is that right?), then no ports are forwarded
2006-08-11T15:01:00.000Z	el_isma	sanmarcos	so XP only suffers from IE XD
2006-08-11T15:02:00.000Z	sanmarcos	el_isma	I am talking about iptables -A INPUT -j DROP, stuff like that, blocking everything except allowing somet hings
2006-08-11T15:30:00.000Z	el_isma	sanmarcos	they are, indeed. They are just buried... many many links away from main page
2006-08-11T15:30:00.000Z	el_isma	sanmarcos	If they moved them more upfront, I'll bet more people would use them
2006-08-11T15:30:00.000Z	el_isma	sanmarcos	Even I, knowing what I want, have a hard time just to get there...
2006-08-11T15:31:00.000Z	sanmarcos	el_isma	yelp also has a good search function
