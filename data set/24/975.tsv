2010-10-04T19:27:00.000Z	rob_p	MooshiMuushi	Which connection is your connection to the 'Net?
2010-10-04T19:27:00.000Z	MooshiMuushi	rob_p	 Wireless.
2010-10-04T19:28:00.000Z	rob_p	MooshiMuushi	Ok.  First thing, don't use networkmanager.  Then configure your wired interface *without* a gateway and you should be set.
2010-10-04T19:29:00.000Z	MooshiMuushi	rob_p	I went into Startup Applications and unchecked the box for the network manager.
2010-10-04T19:30:00.000Z	MooshiMuushi	rob_p	I some setted up the /etc/network/interfaces so that I can connect ot the inter through wlan0.
2010-10-04T19:30:00.000Z	MooshiMuushi	rob_p	Now I have no idea how to set up the eth0.
2010-10-04T19:32:00.000Z	rob_p	MooshiMuushi	Not sure if that will keep networkmanager from interferring with your config but if so, you should be set.  Just configure eth0 with a static IP and netmask and you should be good.
2010-10-04T19:34:00.000Z	MooshiMuushi	rob_p	PM.
2010-10-04T19:34:00.000Z	rob_p	MooshiMuushi	ok
2010-10-04T20:47:00.000Z	MooshiMuushi	rob_p	It didn't work..
2010-10-04T20:53:00.000Z	rob_p	MooshiMuushi	How'd it go?
2010-10-04T20:53:00.000Z	MooshiMuushi	rob_p	Didn't work ^^"
2010-10-04T20:54:00.000Z	rob_p	MooshiMuushi	What happened?  Did your network settings come up ok?  Were you able to ping out to either network?
2010-10-04T20:55:00.000Z	MooshiMuushi	rob_p	Nope. I couldn't get wireless! :D
2010-10-04T20:56:00.000Z	MooshiMuushi	rob_p	Right now I'm doing this: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=202834
2010-10-04T20:56:00.000Z	rob_p	MooshiMuushi	I'd suggest you get your wireless up and running with a manual configuration.  Once you have that, then add the wired one.
2010-10-04T20:57:00.000Z	MooshiMuushi	rob_p	Trying right now :)
2010-10-04T20:58:00.000Z	rob_p	MooshiMuushi	Ok.  Good luck with it.
2010-10-04T20:58:00.000Z	MooshiMuushi	rob_p	Thanks :D
2010-10-04T21:09:00.000Z	MooshiMuushi	rob_p	Got it to work.
2010-10-04T21:09:00.000Z	MooshiMuushi	rob_p	Now all I need is to add in the eth0.
2010-10-04T21:09:00.000Z	MooshiMuushi	rob_p	Together with the wlan0.
2010-10-04T21:11:00.000Z	MooshiMuushi	rob_p	brb.
2010-10-05T08:02:00.000Z	rob_p	MooshiMuushi	Good to hear!
