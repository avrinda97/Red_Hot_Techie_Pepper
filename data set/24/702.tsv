2011-09-10T01:45:00.000Z	savid		I'm trying to do an EOL upgrade from Jaunty to Karmic, and am following this documentation:   https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EOLUpgrades/Jaunty .    I'm  trying to do "sudo do-release-upgrade",  however it says command not found.  Any ideas?
2011-09-10T01:47:00.000Z	savid		yep
2011-09-10T01:47:00.000Z	savid		I'll run it again
2011-09-10T01:47:00.000Z	savid		nope, still not found
2011-09-10T01:47:00.000Z	Polah	savid	Are you running a server? You require at least update-manager-core to use do-release-upgrade
2011-09-10T01:48:00.000Z	savid	Polah	yes, running a server
2011-09-10T01:48:00.000Z	Polah	savid	Install update-manager-core and retry
2011-09-10T01:50:00.000Z	savid	Polah	thanks, that was it.   Although, now I'm getting this:  http://pastie.org/2510715
2011-09-10T01:55:00.000Z	Polah	savid	Might be because you're using a non-LTS release and you're trying to jump straight to Lucid, skipping 9.10. You might have to change your settings to go to 9.10 and then 10.04, then set it back to LTS-only
2011-09-10T01:55:00.000Z	savid	Polah	I'm  just following this:  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EOLUpgrades/Jaunty
2011-09-22T02:00:00.000Z	Polah	savid	Why 8000? Why not 80 or 8080?
2011-09-22T02:01:00.000Z	savid	Polah	because that's the port that's in use.  I want to know what's using it.
2011-09-22T02:01:00.000Z	Polah	savid	Use a different port?
2011-09-22T02:01:00.000Z	savid	Polah	 that's not my question.
2011-09-22T02:01:00.000Z	savid	Polah	I want to know how to find out what is using that port.
2011-09-22T02:02:00.000Z	Polah	savid	netstat can show open ports. However, it would be simpler (and for a webserver make more sense, since HTTP uses 80 and 8080) to use another port
2011-09-22T02:03:00.000Z	savid	Polah	 django's default web develeopment port is port 8000,  also known as http-alt
2011-09-22T02:03:00.000Z	Polah	savid	80 is standard http, 8080 is alternate, not 8000
2011-09-22T02:05:00.000Z	savid	Polah	well,  NMAP reports it as http-alt.  Either way, does it matter?   it's the standard for Django.
2011-09-22T02:06:00.000Z	Polah	savid	I'm just saying the standard for http is 80, or 8080 sometimes. Since your 8000 is being used by something, it would be better to just configure the webserver to use another port rather than stop whatever is using 8000 which if you want to maintain over time if it's a service, you'll need to reconfigure that anyway
2011-09-22T02:07:00.000Z	savid	Polah	 I've been using Django for 3 years.   Port 8000 is not generally used by anything else.  I'm assuming my current problem is that there's another django webserver running somewhere.   Hence the reason I would like to find the process and kill it.
2011-09-22T02:08:00.000Z	Polah	savid	Look in service --status-all, and ps -A for the process. If so, perhaps use that webserver instead of a new one, assuming Django can host multiple sites.
2011-09-22T02:09:00.000Z	savid	Polah	 it's a development server, not a system-wide service.
2011-09-22T02:11:00.000Z	savid	Polah	nm, finally found it.
