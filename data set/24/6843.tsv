2005-07-12T15:17:00.000Z	apollo2011		I can't Smeg to run.  I have run it but when I click on it in the menu, a taskbar entry comes up as "Starting Smeg Menu Editor" and then goes away
2005-07-12T15:17:00.000Z	bimberi	apollo2011	Try running it from a terminal to see if there are any messages
2005-07-12T15:21:00.000Z	bimberi	apollo2011	Have a look in /usr/share/applications for the file that has the bad entry
2005-07-12T15:22:00.000Z	apollo2011	bimberi	thx
2005-07-12T15:22:00.000Z	bimberi	apollo2011	yw :)
2005-07-12T15:23:00.000Z	apollo2011	bimberi	no its not in there.  It looks like none of the ones I added with Smeg are in that folder
2005-07-12T15:25:00.000Z	bimberi	apollo2011	Hmm.  You could search for it using find ...
2005-07-12T15:25:00.000Z	apollo2011	bimberi	tried that :-s
2005-07-12T15:26:00.000Z	bimberi	apollo2011	k. I'm starting to struggle now.  I thought smeg managed entries in that dir
2005-07-12T15:27:00.000Z	apollo2011	bimberi	ok.  I don't even know why Smeg would allow you to create an invalid entry that then would cause it to not start
2005-07-12T15:27:00.000Z	bimberi	apollo2011	Ooh - have a look in ~/.local/share/applications/
2005-07-12T15:28:00.000Z	apollo2011	bimberi	yay! its in there. let's see if when I delete it, it gets fixed....
2005-07-12T15:28:00.000Z	bimberi	apollo2011	You're right - it's a bug I'd say - smeg is fairly new
2005-07-12T15:29:00.000Z	apollo2011	bimberi	it must be saved in an smeg file somewhere because not it complains about it being in a file...
2005-07-12T15:29:00.000Z	apollo2011	bimberi	  File "<string>", line 6
2005-07-12T15:30:00.000Z	apollo2011	bimberi	that didn't print well.  the caret goes under the s in America's.  So presumably, its the apostrophe messing it up
2005-07-12T15:33:00.000Z	bimberi	apollo2011	You could try searching for the file with "grep -r America *" in ~/.local
2005-07-12T15:34:00.000Z	bimberi	apollo2011	failing that - in the whole filesystem
2005-07-12T15:34:00.000Z	apollo2011	bimberi	will do
2005-12-20T06:22:00.000Z	bimberi	apollo2011	Applications -> System Tools -> New Login
2005-12-20T06:22:00.000Z	apollo2011	bimberi	yeah, but is there a way to switch between the two once I have created a second?
2005-12-20T06:22:00.000Z	bimberi	apollo2011	then ctrl-alt-f7 will be the first login and ctrl-alt-f8 will be the second
2005-12-20T06:23:00.000Z	apollo2011	bimberi	oh ok thx
2005-12-20T06:23:00.000Z	bimberi	apollo2011	oops, misread your question.  But got there anyway :)
