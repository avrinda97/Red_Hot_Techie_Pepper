2008-10-07T06:20:00.000Z	abe3k		hi guys, I tried installing blender from the add/remove app, but I encountered an error saying that the media is read only , I had to restart and do a fsck then login back to my ubuntu, I went to my graphics applications folder and I didn't find blender there, so I used the add/remove to reinstall it and I've found out that its already there, I tried to remove it but this is the message that I'm getting "E: blender: Package is in a very bad inconsistent state
2008-10-07T06:21:00.000Z	abe3k		 - you should" ... any help is really appreciated .
