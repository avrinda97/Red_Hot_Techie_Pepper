2008-05-25T22:09:00.000Z	akincer		I've got sound but no picture with DVDs on Hardy. Anybody know how to fix it?
2008-05-25T22:10:00.000Z	pulse	akincer	have you downloaded the livdvdcss2 libraries?
2008-05-25T22:10:00.000Z	akincer	pulse	Yes
2008-05-25T22:11:00.000Z	pulse	akincer	hehe sorry can't help beyond that...what program are you using to view DVDs?
2008-05-25T22:11:00.000Z	akincer	pulse	Tried both Totem and Mplayer. Both have same problem
2008-05-25T22:12:00.000Z	pulse	akincer	did you download the w32codecs or w64codecs packages?
2008-05-25T22:14:00.000Z	akincer	pulse	No. Intel graphics
2008-05-25T22:15:00.000Z	akincer	pulse	I had DVD working Gutsy, so I _know_ it can work
2008-05-25T22:16:00.000Z	pulse	akincer	do you have the medibuntu respositories installed?
2008-05-25T22:16:00.000Z	akincer	pulse	Yes
2008-05-25T22:17:00.000Z	pulse	akincer	 how about the gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly?
2008-05-25T22:18:00.000Z	akincer	pulse	Yes
2008-05-25T22:19:00.000Z	pulse	akincer	hmm have you tried xine? maybe even installing the libraries required by it could work
2008-05-25T22:19:00.000Z	akincer	pulse	I'll try that. But to say I'm disappointed with how difficult this is would be an understatement.
2008-05-25T22:19:00.000Z	pulse	akincer	xine-ui
2008-05-25T22:19:00.000Z	pulse	akincer	yeah well...legal problems...DRM and all that
2008-05-25T22:20:00.000Z	akincer	pulse	It still shouldn't be hard to enter a few manual commands--legal issues or no
2008-05-25T22:21:00.000Z	pulse	akincer	I know what you mean and I sympathize with you
2008-05-25T22:21:00.000Z	akincer	pulse	I love Ubuntu, but these sorts of issues need to be resolved yesterday for Ubuntu to make traction on the desktop
2008-05-25T22:23:00.000Z	pulse	akincer	are you able to play movie files and whatnot?
2008-05-25T22:25:00.000Z	akincer	pulse	I think so, but I can check. Xine has no video either
2008-05-25T22:26:00.000Z	akincer	pulse	a WMV file just had no video. Hmmmmmm
2008-05-25T22:29:00.000Z	akincer	pulse	I think it boils down to video playback of all types except for youtube seems to be broken
2008-05-25T22:30:00.000Z	pulse	akincer	xine has the same problem you say?
