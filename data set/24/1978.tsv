2009-09-03T19:39:00.000Z	jerkman		hey all,
2009-09-03T19:39:00.000Z	jerkman		i was wondering if it is possible to share printers from my windows machine to my linux machine using CUPS, as SAMBA doesnt seem to like my printers
2009-09-03T19:40:00.000Z	ari5av	jerkman	yes it is, I do it at home
2009-09-03T19:41:00.000Z	jerkman	ari5av	so go on, i have 2 usb printers, both supported by linux, but not over samba
2009-09-03T19:41:00.000Z	jerkman	ari5av	yes
2009-09-03T19:44:00.000Z	jerkman	ari5av	yes, they are. other windows machines connect and use them
2009-09-03T19:44:00.000Z	jerkman	ari5av	ok
2009-09-03T19:47:00.000Z	jerkman	ari5av	im trying to say that these printers arent supported in linux over samba
2009-09-03T19:47:00.000Z	jerkman	ari5av	plus, it isnt seeing the samba shares
2009-09-03T19:48:00.000Z	ari5av	jerkman	what make/model are the printers?
2009-09-03T19:49:00.000Z	jerkman	ari5av	both have linux drivers
2009-09-03T19:49:00.000Z	jerkman	ari5av	but it seems samba isnt connecting, so maybe that is the actual issue??
2009-09-03T19:50:00.000Z	jerkman	ari5av	interesting... "Failed to recieve share list from server"
2009-09-03T19:51:00.000Z	jerkman	ari5av	no, because the other win machines on the network have no problem
2009-09-03T19:51:00.000Z	jerkman	ari5av	printers and files are shared and it all works...
2009-09-03T19:52:00.000Z	jerkman	ari5av	just apparently not for me
2009-09-03T20:04:00.000Z	jerkman	ari5av	 there is no 2240 driver, will a 2250 do?
2009-09-03T20:05:00.000Z	jerkman	ari5av	ok, it works with the ML-1640 driver!!
2009-09-03T20:06:00.000Z	ari5av	jerkman	you got it to print a test page?
2009-09-03T20:07:00.000Z	jerkman	ari5av	yes, on the samsung...
2009-09-03T20:07:00.000Z	ari5av	jerkman	hooray!  what about the other one?
2009-09-03T20:09:00.000Z	jerkman	ari5av	my hp made a funny clicking noise and didnt print
2009-09-03T20:10:00.000Z	ari5av	jerkman	purge it in fire, hp printers are the devil
2009-09-03T20:10:00.000Z	jerkman	ari5av	it has a linux driver
