2007-02-11T13:34:00.000Z	AmaroqWolf		I love how in a room full of people knowledgeable about ubuntu, there is no single 'awesome' user who knows everything about everything. There's so many things to know about it, that our knowledges are diverse and we can always help eachother, as the expert in one situation may find himself the inexperianced in another.
2007-02-11T13:35:00.000Z	apecat	AmaroqWolf	i consider myself an intermiate user who is too lazy to learn everything. that's why i stay with ubuntu and debian ;)
2007-02-11T13:38:00.000Z	apecat	AmaroqWolf	yes, it's fun without getting too much like slackware or gentoo :)
2007-02-11T13:39:00.000Z	AmaroqWolf	apecat	*chuckles* From what I hear, it'll be quite some time before I'm good enough to attempt to install gentoo.
2007-02-11T13:40:00.000Z	apecat	AmaroqWolf	if you're able to follow documentation there's nothing wrong with trying. chanches are that you'll learn to love it
2007-02-11T13:40:00.000Z	AmaroqWolf	apecat	:P I do have an extra computer I could try it on.
2007-02-11T13:42:00.000Z	apecat	AmaroqWolf	well you have nothing to loose. except for your time and social life :)
2007-02-11T13:43:00.000Z	AmaroqWolf	apecat	xD I've been told it'll take two weeks for an about average smart person to set it up.
2007-02-11T13:44:00.000Z	apecat	AmaroqWolf	yes and no, depending how fast your machine can compile stuff, how much stuff that will break, how many first timer mistakes you do etc ;)
2007-02-11T13:44:00.000Z	AmaroqWolf	apecat	lol, I see. x3
2007-02-11T13:45:00.000Z	apecat	AmaroqWolf	keep in mind that gnome or kde takes something like 8 hours to compile on the athlon xp 2100/512 mb eam+ i'm writing this on
2007-02-11T13:45:00.000Z	AmaroqWolf	apecat	whoa.
2007-02-11T13:45:00.000Z	AmaroqWolf	apecat	what ghz is that?
2007-02-11T13:45:00.000Z	apecat	AmaroqWolf	1.7
2007-02-11T13:46:00.000Z	AmaroqWolf	apecat	I think my other machine is like, 1 ghz
2007-02-11T13:46:00.000Z	apecat	AmaroqWolf	so when you try, you may want to stay with lightweight window managers and stuff like that
2007-02-11T13:46:00.000Z	AmaroqWolf	apecat	my other computer couldn't even boot from the ubuntu CD. xD It would try to mount the filesystem when starting up, and it would get stuck like that.
2007-02-11T13:47:00.000Z	apecat	AmaroqWolf	well it's not all that tragic if you stay with a clean and minimal system. fluxbox, icewm etc are things people learn to love over time. these window managers are so unbloat that its hard to believe
2007-02-11T13:48:00.000Z	apecat	AmaroqWolf	how much ram does it have. the ubuntu live cd installer is for machines with 256 megabyte sof ram or more. use the alternate cd for machines with less ram. in fact, i always use the alternate cd. much faster to get the install going
2007-02-11T13:48:00.000Z	AmaroqWolf	apecat	I think it has half that ram.
2007-02-11T13:49:00.000Z	apecat	AmaroqWolf	then i think you won't get the full ddesktop live cd working becouse of the ram. if you want ubuntu on it, you might want xubuntu instead, xfce is leighter
2007-02-11T13:50:00.000Z	AmaroqWolf	apecat	I've always wondered what the difference is between ubuntu, kubuntu, and xubuntu.
2007-02-11T13:50:00.000Z	apecat	AmaroqWolf	but you could install ubuntu on it with the alternate installer, which has an easy to use menu driven interface
2007-02-11T13:51:00.000Z	apecat	AmaroqWolf	those are all the same thing, exept for the default deskto. kubuntu has a customized kde desktop, xubuntu has a customized xfce. you can try either of thsese by installing the packages xubuntu-desktop, kubuntu desktop
