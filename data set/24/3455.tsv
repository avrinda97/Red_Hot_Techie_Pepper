2009-01-19T05:21:00.000Z	gleaken		question regarding bluetooth mighty mouse left clicking issue.  I cannot left click.  Scroll and movement works, left and right click don't work
2009-01-19T05:21:00.000Z	gleaken		any ideas?
2009-01-19T05:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gleaken	do you use compiz?
2009-01-19T05:22:00.000Z	gleaken	ActionParsnip	yes
2009-01-19T05:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gleaken	its a compiz thing, I've seen compiz break mouse clicks loads
2009-01-19T05:23:00.000Z	gleaken	ActionParsnip	my internal trackpad works
2009-01-19T05:23:00.000Z	gleaken	ActionParsnip	let me turn off compiz
2009-01-19T05:24:00.000Z	gleaken	ActionParsnip	nope, no luck
2009-01-19T05:24:00.000Z	gleaken	ActionParsnip	this is not the clicking issue I have seen in firefox, no mouse click is recognized at all
2009-01-19T05:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gleaken	does the mouse click create an event in xev
2009-01-19T05:26:00.000Z	gleaken	ActionParsnip	haven't checked yet, what would the best way to do that be?
2009-01-19T05:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gleaken	run xev in terminal and click in the lil box, it will react
2009-01-19T05:27:00.000Z	gleaken	ActionParsnip	got it, nope, no events registered
2009-01-19T05:27:00.000Z	gleaken	ActionParsnip	the motion, scrolling register, but not left or right click
2009-01-19T05:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gleaken	ok then you need to reconfigure the driver or link between as the mouse click is not being detected
2009-01-19T05:29:00.000Z	gleaken	ActionParsnip	ok, well, I tried plain jane setup with the new gui config, and I tried using the older change to xorg.conf which I used before, both the same issue
2009-01-19T05:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gleaken	what make / model is the mouse?
2009-01-19T05:30:00.000Z	gleaken	ActionParsnip	it uses the evdev driver
2009-01-19T05:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gleaken	gleaken: what make / model is the mouse?

2009-01-19T05:33:00.000Z	gleaken	ActionParsnip	yep, I used a different xorg.conf section because I don't want the mighty mouse to be my main mouse, so I changed corepointer to option sendcoreevents true, but this site also says left clicks are issues, but the main article has no problems
2009-01-19T05:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gleaken	i'd try it as the main mouse to see if it makes it work
2009-01-19T05:37:00.000Z	gleaken	ActionParsnip	considering the way input devices are automatically recognized, what way would be best to stop the touchpad from being enumerated as the corepointer, just change the entry in xorg.conf?
