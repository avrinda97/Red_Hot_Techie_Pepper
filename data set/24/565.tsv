2011-06-02T09:45:00.000Z	dantheman73		honestly i think im gonna go back to windows
2011-06-02T09:45:00.000Z	dantheman73		linux is a bit faster but its really quite worthless since its not compatible with anything
2011-06-02T09:46:00.000Z	dantheman73		cell thunder: haha dont be rude man. Look you gotta see this from my perspective;
2011-06-02T09:47:00.000Z	dantheman73		everytime i try and download an app from ubuntu i get that "dependency" issue and it wont work, and the one thing that i actually use my computer for (ipod) wont work. I guess linux is cool if your into programing and coding and stuff, but im not a computer-savy person.
2011-06-02T09:48:00.000Z	tensorpudding	dantheman73	dependency issue?
2011-06-02T09:49:00.000Z	tensorpudding	dantheman73	could you say a little more about what this dependency issue you have is
2011-06-02T09:50:00.000Z	tensorpudding	dantheman73	also i'm pretty sure the ipod is supported
2011-06-02T09:51:00.000Z	tensorpudding	dantheman73	can you be more specific about what happened? screenshot?
2011-06-02T09:52:00.000Z	tensorpudding	dantheman73	you can put it on imagebin.org

2011-06-02T09:57:00.000Z	tensorpudding	dantheman73	that version of amarok isn't the one in the standard repos, i don't think
2011-06-02T09:59:00.000Z	tensorpudding	dantheman73	can you open your /etc/apt/sources.list file and put it on a pastebin?
2011-06-02T10:00:00.000Z	dantheman73	tensorpudding	Im sorry sir but I dont know what any of that means, and i dont know how to open any of those or where to find them
2011-06-02T10:00:00.000Z	tensorpudding	dantheman73	it's a text file
