2005-07-04T15:51:00.000Z	cspan		when i try to log into a gnome session
2005-07-04T15:51:00.000Z	cspan		y just sits there
2005-07-04T15:51:00.000Z	rasputnik	cspan	changed anything?
2005-07-04T15:51:00.000Z	cspan	rasputnik	i installed kubuntu
2005-07-04T15:52:00.000Z	rasputnik	cspan	can you get into 'failsafe' from the session menu?
2005-07-04T15:52:00.000Z	cspan	rasputnik	no
2005-07-04T15:57:00.000Z	rasputnik	cspan	try runnig the app from a terminal, see if you get any useful error messages
2005-07-04T15:58:00.000Z	cspan	rasputnik	no error messages at all
2005-07-04T15:59:00.000Z	rasputnik	cspan	wierd. this is from under kde is it?
2005-07-04T16:00:00.000Z	rasputnik	cspan	: what app
2005-07-04T16:00:00.000Z	cspan	rasputnik	every gnome app i tried except gnome-network-configuration
2005-07-04T16:01:00.000Z	rasputnik	cspan	: it's not a hostname thing is it? i changed my hostname from a terminal yesterday and gnome shat itself
2005-07-04T16:01:00.000Z	cspan	rasputnik	i didn't change the hostname
2005-07-04T16:02:00.000Z	rasputnik	cspan	try blowing away your gnome settings: # rm -rf ~/.gnome*
2005-07-04T16:02:00.000Z	cspan	rasputnik	i tried
2005-07-04T16:03:00.000Z	rasputnik	cspan	that wont' clear out your .gnome* folders
2005-07-04T16:03:00.000Z	cspan	rasputnik	uninstall-purge, but anyway i cleared them manually too
2005-07-04T16:05:00.000Z	rasputnik	cspan	then I think it's a dns thing maybe, especially if your network is screwy
2005-07-04T16:05:00.000Z	cspan	rasputnik	any suggestions?
2005-07-04T16:05:00.000Z	rasputnik	cspan	is your hostname in /etc/hosts
2005-07-04T16:06:00.000Z	rasputnik	cspan	that's all I can think of. gnome has big trouble if it cant' resolve your host, because it can't find ORBit
2005-07-04T16:07:00.000Z	rasputnik	cspan	wait and see if it helps first :)
