2011-08-13T23:06:00.000Z	theadmin	ronin___	That says *nothing* at all, be as descriptive as you can
2011-08-13T23:08:00.000Z	ronin___	theadmin	sorry, The action would require the installation of packages from not authenticated sources.
2011-08-13T23:10:00.000Z	theadmin	ronin___	Huh... That's odd, but you can just click "Continue" or whatever?
2011-08-13T23:11:00.000Z	ronin___	theadmin	It doesn't work
2011-08-13T23:11:00.000Z	ronin___	theadmin	In konsole and software center
2011-08-13T23:11:00.000Z	theadmin	ronin___	Oh, you use the KDE edition?
2011-08-13T23:12:00.000Z	ronin___	theadmin	No Gnome
2011-08-13T23:12:00.000Z	theadmin	ronin___	...but "konsole" is a KDE app... or, wait, are you German? xD
2011-08-13T23:12:00.000Z	theadmin	ronin___	Cause that'd explain it
2011-08-13T23:13:00.000Z	ronin___	theadmin	I use yakuake
2011-08-13T23:14:00.000Z	theadmin	ronin___	Okay... Well, um, honestly I don't quite understand what may have caused this mess
2011-08-13T23:16:00.000Z	theadmin	ronin___	To each their own.
2011-08-13T23:16:00.000Z	theadmin	ronin___	I find Gnome an awful, terrible mess personally.
2011-08-13T23:16:00.000Z	ronin___	theadmin	Why?
2011-08-13T23:17:00.000Z	theadmin	ronin___	Well, okay. Gnome2 is *perfect*. Gnome3 however...
2011-08-13T23:17:00.000Z	theadmin	ronin___	I can't use it productively.
2011-08-13T23:17:00.000Z	ronin___	theadmin	It need's some work
2011-08-13T23:17:00.000Z	ronin___	theadmin	I try to learn linux kernel and gnome
2011-08-13T23:17:00.000Z	ronin___	theadmin	Before 6 month ago
2011-08-13T23:18:00.000Z	ronin___	theadmin	It's so difficult
2011-08-13T23:22:00.000Z	ronin___	theadmin	U suggest which one is Google?
2011-08-13T23:22:00.000Z	theadmin	ronin___	I think... KDE. It's the most powerful after all.
