2008-05-02T20:03:00.000Z	__mork		no good soul that can help me???? :-(
2008-05-02T20:03:00.000Z	__mork		(wireless problem: routing and remembering password)
2008-05-02T20:04:00.000Z	bazhang	__mork	the 3945? doe the machine see it? can the nic see the ap? what is the encryption? wep/wpa/wpa etc
2008-05-02T20:06:00.000Z	__mork	bazhang	thanks, all works fine, except that when i disconnect cable on eth0 and start wireless (iwl3945) (hardware switch+network manager profile): 1. it remembers eth0 in the routing table (which mess up the route) and 2. it don't remember wpa personal (open) password
2008-05-02T20:07:00.000Z	bazhang	__mork	you know the command line at all?
2008-05-02T20:07:00.000Z	__mork	bazhang	yes, but i would like the process is automated: i have a WIFE (!), a difficult password, and to delete the route 192.168.1.0 eth0
2008-05-02T20:08:00.000Z	bazhang	__mork	why are you switching between eth and wifi?
2008-05-02T20:08:00.000Z	__mork	bazhang	 i forgot to mention that i use nm in manual config mode.
2008-05-02T20:08:00.000Z	__mork	bazhang	i have to move the notebook, you know
2008-05-02T20:08:00.000Z	bazhang	__mork	right I mean why not just alway leave it on wireless
2008-05-02T20:12:00.000Z	__mork	bazhang	I read the article you posted, but all that works fine. I have in fact a /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf file with all ok.
2008-05-02T20:13:00.000Z	bazhang	__mork	ah good
2008-05-02T20:13:00.000Z	__mork	bazhang	I don't understand how to modify the route change after the wireless is switched on and activated in nm manual configuration applet.
2008-05-02T20:13:00.000Z	bazhang	__mork	likely a networking restart will do that
2008-05-02T20:14:00.000Z	__mork	bazhang	I do let network restart each time wireless (or wired) profile is selected in nm applet?
2008-05-02T20:15:00.000Z	bazhang	__mork	still not clear why you dont wifi all the time--you can get a $5 range extender for that you know
2008-05-02T20:16:00.000Z	__mork	bazhang	well, i have fear of radiations
2008-05-02T20:16:00.000Z	bazhang	__mork	that should not be an issue
2008-05-02T20:16:00.000Z	__mork	bazhang	maybe irrational but... so it sis.
2008-05-02T20:16:00.000Z	bazhang	__mork	tinfoil is even less than $5 ;]
2008-05-02T20:17:00.000Z	__mork	bazhang	i feel that machine should do what i want: i.e. set up correctly the route after a net interface is up and working
2008-05-02T20:17:00.000Z	__mork	bazhang	this one seems to me the right linux way
2008-05-02T20:18:00.000Z	bazhang	__mork	my limited knowledge only extends to wireless; the much smarter folks here can likely help with that
2008-05-02T20:18:00.000Z	__mork	bazhang	thanks anyway, you were very kind.
