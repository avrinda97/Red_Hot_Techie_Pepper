2007-10-28T01:37:00.000Z	RDProgrammer	hmuller	did you find anything?
2007-10-28T01:38:00.000Z	hmuller	RDProgrammer	 You are looking for partition recovery.  But you may be able to do the same thing that I did which restored my RECOVERY partition, which was to reinstall XP
2007-10-28T01:39:00.000Z	RDProgrammer	hmuller	what if it does not?
2007-10-28T01:40:00.000Z	hmuller	RDProgrammer	 Then you are stuck learning Autopsy and Sleuthkit, and I would recommend the Backtrack LiveCD.
2007-10-28T01:40:00.000Z	RDProgrammer	hmuller	can we have a private chat? I don't know how to start one, but maybe you can
2007-10-28T01:40:00.000Z	hmuller	RDProgrammer	 I don't think chatzilla does that
2007-10-28T01:41:00.000Z	RDProgrammer	hmuller	ok, np
2007-10-28T01:41:00.000Z	RDProgrammer	hmuller	do you have aim? or msn?
2007-10-28T01:41:00.000Z	hmuller	RDProgrammer	 and if you are stuck doing the latter, then you'll need a huge drive for the image.
2007-10-28T01:42:00.000Z	hmuller	RDProgrammer	 sorry, i don't use those
2007-10-28T01:43:00.000Z	RDProgrammer	hmuller	np, I do not have a drive large enough right now. Is there anyway to just examine the data and remove it using a liveCD? I only need a small portion of the data. Everything else is backed up
2007-10-28T01:44:00.000Z	hmuller	RDProgrammer	 google that backtrack livecd I mentioned, include forensics in the search terms to narrow the results.
2007-10-28T01:44:00.000Z	RDProgrammer	hmuller	i have played with that before I believe, let me do it now tho, ironically I have the .iso on the fucked up drive
2007-10-28T01:45:00.000Z	hmuller	RDProgrammer	 at least you are familiar with it.  I remember there was a trick to getting autopsy/sleuthkit to work, you'll have to figure that out.
2007-10-28T01:46:00.000Z	hmuller	RDProgrammer	 but once you do figure it out, you'll be able to find  whatever it is you are looking for and restore it.
2007-10-28T01:46:00.000Z	RDProgrammer	hmuller	will it have some sort of file browser or something?
2007-10-28T01:47:00.000Z	hmuller	RDProgrammer	 Autopsy has a browser interface, which will show you the files it can find.
2007-10-28T01:47:00.000Z	RDProgrammer	hmuller	ok, great. I am goign to look into both of those
2007-10-28T01:47:00.000Z	hmuller	RDProgrammer	 I recovered 90% of a 20GB harddrive using those tools 1.5 years ago
2007-10-28T01:48:00.000Z	RDProgrammer	hmuller	is there a way i could contact you once the iso finished DLing, it'll take about an hour on my slow pipe
2007-10-28T01:49:00.000Z	hmuller	RDProgrammer	 You can shoot an email to hlmuller insert the at symbol here yahoo insert the dot here com.  I won't be available for the rest of the evening, but I'd be happy to answer any questions later.
2007-10-28T01:50:00.000Z	RDProgrammer	hmuller	thank you a lot, its great to find people that'll help out, maybe i can return the favor one day
2007-10-28T01:50:00.000Z	hmuller	RDProgrammer	 Good luck ttyl.  I gotta run.
2007-10-28T01:50:00.000Z	RDProgrammer	hmuller	bye
