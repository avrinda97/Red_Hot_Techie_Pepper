2009-11-18T18:20:00.000Z	thanda		How can this be possible? Quite a surprise...
2009-11-18T18:21:00.000Z	thanda		When trying to upgrade 8.04 -> update-manager -d
2009-11-18T18:21:00.000Z	thanda		I got, what I have posted in the screenshot.
2009-11-18T18:22:00.000Z	thanda		I am sure this, can't be right.

2009-11-18T18:23:00.000Z	thanda		How this is possible? :-)
2009-11-18T18:25:00.000Z	thanda		from 8.04
2009-11-18T18:27:00.000Z	thanda		http://img200.imageshack.us/img200/9413/updatemanager.png
2009-11-18T18:27:00.000Z	thanda		from 8.04 -> update-manager -d
2009-11-18T18:29:00.000Z	thanda		I think, update-manager -d is little crazy to deal with. ;-)
2009-11-18T18:30:00.000Z	kostkon	thanda	actually, i suppose it tries to upgrade you to the next lts, that is lynx
2009-11-18T18:32:00.000Z	kostkon	thanda	look
2009-11-18T18:32:00.000Z	kostkon	thanda	what the -d option does
2009-11-18T18:32:00.000Z	kostkon	thanda	 -d, --devel-release
2009-11-18T18:32:00.000Z	kostkon	thanda	thus, you are trying to force an upgrade to the latest dev ver, that is lynx
2009-11-18T18:34:00.000Z	thanda	kostkon	I understand it, but proposing on something which is not released...does not make sense for me. But, I never mind at this point.
2009-11-18T18:34:00.000Z	kostkon	thanda	but, you are calling the update manager from the terminal
2009-11-18T18:34:00.000Z	kostkon	thanda	i mean, you are specifically calling it with the -d option
2009-11-18T18:35:00.000Z	kostkon	thanda	in regular terms, a user will never do this anyway
2009-11-18T18:35:00.000Z	thanda	kostkon	true, I do call update-manager with -d through terminal.
2009-11-18T18:35:00.000Z	kostkon	thanda	if you just open the update manager from the menu
2009-11-18T18:35:00.000Z	kostkon	thanda	it will give you the ooption to upgrade to lynx only when it comes out
2009-11-18T18:37:00.000Z	thanda	kostkon	:-) I am aware of it, since 8.04 is LTS, but it would be nice to have an option to upgrade to the current release.
2009-11-18T18:38:00.000Z	thanda	kostkon	Thankyou very much indeed.
