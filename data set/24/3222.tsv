2008-04-11T01:14:00.000Z	Oprtz		hello there
2008-04-11T01:16:00.000Z	Oprtz		today i install ubuntu with windowsXP on my desktop machine with 2 seperate HDD for both OS (NO DUEL BOOT), when log into ubuntu it shows correct time and date but when log in to windowsXP the time is 5 hours behind, shows 5 hour difference, why is that? how to correct this problem?
2008-04-11T01:16:00.000Z	erUSUL	Oprtz	you choosed during ubuntu install to set bios to utc time; didn't you?
2008-04-11T01:18:00.000Z	erUSUL	Oprtz	In /etc/default/rcS you can set UTC to no to make linux "respect" the (wrong) windows time
2008-11-11T23:46:00.000Z	erUSUL	Oprtz	should work out of the box... does it show in "iwconfig" output?
2008-11-11T23:48:00.000Z	Oprtz	erUSUL	 can i pm u the output of iwconfig ?

2009-04-25T15:11:00.000Z	erUSUL	Oprtz	you can "repair it" with a torrent client
2009-04-25T15:12:00.000Z	Oprtz	erUSUL	can u explain how ?
2009-04-25T15:13:00.000Z	erUSUL	Oprtz	just download the torrent corresponding to the iso you have when the program ask where to save it overwritte the iso you have... the torrent client will verify the file and dl only what its needed
