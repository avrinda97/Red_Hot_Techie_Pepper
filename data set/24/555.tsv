2012-05-13T04:47:00.000Z	Nicolas_Leonida2		hi, I'm trying to attach a new hard disk to my server, sudo lshw -C disk shows that capabilities: partitioned partitioned:dos
2012-05-13T04:47:00.000Z	Nicolas_Leonida2		however sudo mount -t msdos /dev/sdb /media/old5
2012-05-13T04:47:00.000Z	Nicolas_Leonida2		says "wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/sdb"
2012-05-13T04:48:00.000Z	Nicolas_Leonida2		so how do I mount it?
2012-05-13T04:48:00.000Z	Nicolas_Leonida2		with no type it says "mount: you must specify the filesystem type"
2012-05-13T04:49:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	Nicolas_Leonida2	its likely a fat/vfat or ntfs if it came from m$
2012-05-13T04:49:00.000Z	Nicolas_Leonida2		it's not from m$ this is the previous hard disk I had ubuntu on , I need to copy data
2012-05-13T04:49:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	Nicolas_Leonida2	are you sure that it is the whole disk and not a partition?
2012-05-13T04:50:00.000Z	Nicolas_Leonida2	SolarisBoy	what is the whole disk and not a partition?
2012-05-13T04:50:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	Nicolas_Leonida2	/dev/sdb is a whole disk /dev/sdb1 is the first partition
2012-05-13T04:50:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	Nicolas_Leonida2	generally the OS or whatever your looking for is installed to a partition and not a whole disk
2012-05-13T04:50:00.000Z	Nicolas_Leonida2		so should I try to mount sdb1 ?
2012-05-13T04:50:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	Nicolas_Leonida2	so use fdisk to print the partitions and choose the proper one
2012-05-13T04:51:00.000Z	SolarisBoy		Nicolas_Leonida2:no guessing needed, simply fdisk -l /dev/sdb
2012-05-13T04:51:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	Nicolas_Leonida2	maybe as sudo =)
2012-05-13T04:52:00.000Z	Nicolas_Leonida2		it shows sdb1,2,5,6,7,8,9,10,11 so they need to be mounted indipendently each?
2012-05-13T04:52:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	Nicolas_Leonida2	once you get the partition fix the command to mount that one instead of the complete disk
2012-05-13T04:52:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	Nicolas_Leonida2	no
2012-05-13T04:52:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	Nicolas_Leonida2	can you gist/post your fdisk -l /dev/sdb output?
2012-05-13T04:52:00.000Z	Nicolas_Leonida2		sure, one sec
2012-05-13T04:53:00.000Z	Nicolas_Leonida2		there we go http://pastebin.com/7SmgtpMR
2012-05-13T04:53:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	Nicolas_Leonida2	most likely /dev/sdb1
2012-05-13T04:53:00.000Z	SolarisBoy		lol why did you have so many partitions
2012-05-13T04:53:00.000Z	Nicolas_Leonida2	SolarisBoy	yup, you got it! works now
