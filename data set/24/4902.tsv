2006-12-14T10:53:00.000Z	Mahdi		anybody knows any way to downgrade my kernel to 2.6.17-7? 2.6.17-10 prevents my wireless card from working =/
2006-12-14T10:53:00.000Z	zeeble	Mahdi	your bootloader doesnt give you the option to boot with the older kernel?
2006-12-14T10:54:00.000Z	zeeble	Mahdi	when you boot up, it will ask you which kernel to use.. choose the one where your stuff works
2006-12-14T10:54:00.000Z	Mahdi	zeeble	i just had to reinstall edgy from the cd... the official release doesnt include 2.6.17-7. Only 2.6.17-10

2006-12-14T10:55:00.000Z	Mahdi	zeeble	but from where? LOL ubuntu's archive does not include them anymore!
2006-12-14T10:56:00.000Z	zeeble	Mahdi	download the kernel source and compile it?
2006-12-14T10:57:00.000Z	Mahdi	zeeble	but then i miss the whole point about using a std kernel =//

2006-12-14T11:01:00.000Z	zeeble	Mahdi	dunno. you'll have to build the kernel. with kernel package prolly
2006-12-14T11:01:00.000Z	zeeble	Mahdi	or look around in the mirror for the package you want
