2007-10-26T08:16:00.000Z	matt_l		can anyone tell me why my gaim has been removed? i understand the name was changed to pidgin, but why did it have to be removed during my upgrade to gutsy?

2007-10-26T08:18:00.000Z	leo_rockw	matt_l	it got upgraded to pidgin probly
2007-10-26T08:19:00.000Z	matt_l	leo_rockw	i understand that but why did it have to remove gaim?
2007-10-26T08:19:00.000Z	leo_rockw	matt_l	it didn't remove it, it upgraded it
2007-10-26T08:20:00.000Z	matt_l	leo_rockw	ah, i see now, gaim is a dummy package...any way you can think of to get gaim back, with a working OTR? before i had to install gaim-otr for it to work from the repos...
2007-10-26T08:20:00.000Z	leo_rockw	matt_l	why do you want gaim back? it is obsolete
2007-10-26T08:20:00.000Z	matt_l	leo_rockw	rather let me put it this way, i want the UI of gaim back, reinstalling a working gaim+otr would be a roundabout way i will admit.
2007-10-26T08:23:00.000Z	matt_l	leo_rockw	are you aware of any way to reinstate the old gaim UI to pidgin? that's really all i guess i'm looking for
2007-10-26T08:24:00.000Z	leo_rockw	matt_l	not really
2007-10-26T08:24:00.000Z	leo_rockw	matt_l	even if you do install gaim, it will probly get upgraded to pidgin next time you apt-get upgrade
2007-10-26T08:24:00.000Z	leo_rockw	matt_l	so you'd have to tell ubuntu not to do it manually
2007-10-26T08:25:00.000Z	matt_l	leo_rockw	yeah..because it's still a dummy package right?
2007-10-26T08:25:00.000Z	leo_rockw	matt_l	because to ubuntu gaim is just an outdated version of pidgin
2007-10-26T08:25:00.000Z	leo_rockw	matt_l	so if you tell ubuntu you want to update, it will update gaim because it is old
2007-10-26T08:26:00.000Z	matt_l	leo_rockw	yeah, okay so that option is out the window...
2007-10-26T08:26:00.000Z	leo_rockw	matt_l	there's a way to tell ubuntu not to update a certain package
2007-10-26T08:26:00.000Z	leo_rockw	matt_l	and you can problably find debs for gaim
2007-10-26T08:26:00.000Z	matt_l	leo_rockw	oh? i'm not familar with it
2007-10-26T08:26:00.000Z	leo_rockw	matt_l	i heard of it, never used it so i don't remember it
2007-10-26T08:27:00.000Z	matt_l	leo_rockw	alright, that's a start then. thanks. much more help than the folks in #pidgin were.
2007-10-26T08:27:00.000Z	leo_rockw	matt_l	probably someone here knows how to tell ubuntu not to update a package
2007-10-26T08:29:00.000Z	matt_l	leo_rockw	the only problem with using a deb is if i can get OTR to work. regardless i shall try.
