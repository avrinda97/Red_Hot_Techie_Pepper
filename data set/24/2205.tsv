2009-03-09T09:44:00.000Z	WordMoo		When Jaunty (whatever it is) releases , will it be possible to go Hardy -> Jaunty ?
2009-03-09T09:44:00.000Z	WordMoo		or is that not known at this time ?
2009-03-09T09:44:00.000Z	Flannel	WordMoo	You'll have to go through Intrepid.
2009-03-09T09:44:00.000Z	Flannel	WordMoo	8.04 -> 8.10 -> 9.04
2009-03-09T09:44:00.000Z	WordMoo	Flannel	8.10 uh.. lets see how I can put it..
2009-03-09T09:45:00.000Z	WordMoo	Flannel	Is worthless to me
2009-03-09T09:45:00.000Z	Flannel	WordMoo	If you want to upgrade to 9.04, you'll have to upgrade through it, even if its only for a few minutes.
2009-03-09T09:46:00.000Z	Flannel	WordMoo	You can upgrade with a CD (the alternate CD)
2009-03-09T09:46:00.000Z	WordMoo	Flannel	I mean , will the issues of Intrepid be there in Jaunty , or will they be fixed?
2009-03-09T09:46:00.000Z	Flannel	WordMoo	#ubuntu+1 is the place to go to ask Jaunty questions right now.  I have no idea.
2009-03-09T09:47:00.000Z	Flannel	WordMoo	Certainly nothing wrong with that.  Especially if nothing in the newer versions strikes you as must-have
2009-03-09T09:48:00.000Z	WordMoo	Flannel	Any idea on a LTS release ?  Perhaps after Jaunty ?
2009-03-09T09:49:00.000Z	Flannel	WordMoo	10.04 is the next LTS
2009-03-09T09:51:00.000Z	Flannel	WordMoo	Not only that, but in all likelyhood it'll be the 22nd
2009-03-09T09:51:00.000Z	WordMoo	Flannel	April 22nd ?
2009-03-09T09:52:00.000Z	Flannel	WordMoo	I believe its (as a rule of thumb, not a rule, mind you) the penultimate Thursday of the month.
2009-03-09T09:54:00.000Z	Flannel	WordMoo	You can.  You'll need to boot to the liveCD and resize/move stuff with gparted
2009-03-09T09:55:00.000Z	WordMoo	Flannel	Just go to the installer and click "manual" and resize it up how I want it, then quit the install ?
2009-03-09T09:55:00.000Z	WordMoo	Flannel	Before I actually go to install anything ?
2009-03-09T09:55:00.000Z	Flannel	WordMoo	no, no.  Don't start the installer at all.  Go to System > Administration > Gnome PArtition MAnager
2009-03-09T09:57:00.000Z	WordMoo	Flannel	 I don't see that in the installed version I have , would it be possible for me just to do it now?  IE: get gparted
2009-03-09T09:58:00.000Z	Flannel	WordMoo	You can't modify the partitions you're using.  So while you would be able to shrink the windows partition, you would still have to use a liveCD to expand the others.
2009-03-09T09:59:00.000Z	Flannel	WordMoo	I was under the impression that they had it installed by default, but if not, you'll simply have to install gparted on the liveCD
2009-03-09T09:59:00.000Z	WordMoo	Flannel	Perhaps it's not on the installed version by default ?
