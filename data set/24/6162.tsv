2006-01-04T08:40:00.000Z	pashaw	purplefeltangel	  you get an answer?
2006-01-04T08:40:00.000Z	purplefeltangel	pashaw	nope not yet
2006-01-04T08:42:00.000Z	pashaw	purplefeltangel	  edit /boot/grub/menu.1st   you want to ONLY change near the top it will say  default    0         count your kernels starting with 0,1,2,3,4  til you hit your windows ntry  and change default to that #
2006-01-04T08:43:00.000Z	pashaw	purplefeltangel	  as long as you dont change anything else   you can always manually select your boot kernel  to fix it
2006-01-04T08:43:00.000Z	purplefeltangel	pashaw	so wait, will there just be windows and ubuntu, or do all those other things of ubuntu (safe mode or whatever) count?
2006-01-04T08:43:00.000Z	pashaw	purplefeltangel	 all count    first uncommented entry is 0
2006-01-04T08:44:00.000Z	pashaw	purplefeltangel	  each entry starts with "title"
2006-01-04T08:44:00.000Z	purplefeltangel	pashaw	ok i'll try that
2006-01-04T08:44:00.000Z	purplefeltangel	pashaw	wait, where is the "boot" folder? ^_^;
2006-01-04T08:44:00.000Z	pashaw	purplefeltangel	  then below   default youll see you time out option
2006-01-04T08:44:00.000Z	purplefeltangel		oh nvm
2006-01-04T08:46:00.000Z	purplefeltangel	pashaw	i think windows is 6; does that sound right? :/
2006-01-04T08:46:00.000Z	purplefeltangel	pashaw	and what should i set the timeout to to get there to be no timeout at all? 0 or just some extremely high number?
2006-01-04T08:47:00.000Z	pashaw	purplefeltangel	   dont go below 2-3
2006-01-04T08:47:00.000Z	purplefeltangel	pashaw	i don't understand. D:
2006-01-04T08:47:00.000Z	pashaw	purplefeltangel	too low  youll have a heck of a time picking anything but default
2006-01-04T08:49:00.000Z	purplefeltangel	pashaw	oh, for the timeout! ok. but the number of a given kernel (ie windows) is just its order on the list?
2006-01-04T08:49:00.000Z	pashaw	purplefeltangel	  yes
2006-01-04T08:49:00.000Z	purplefeltangel		ok, thank you!!
2006-01-04T08:49:00.000Z	purplefeltangel	pashaw	er, gragh, how do i get the file to not be read-only?
2006-01-04T08:49:00.000Z	pashaw	purplefeltangel	  sudo
2006-01-04T08:50:00.000Z	purplefeltangel	pashaw	umm sudo what ^^;;; sorry i'm so bad at this
2006-01-04T08:51:00.000Z	pashaw	purplefeltangel	your taking a risk understand?     sudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.1st      just change  default # and timeout nothing else
2006-01-04T08:51:00.000Z	purplefeltangel	pashaw	ok thank you
