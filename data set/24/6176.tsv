2005-12-24T09:20:00.000Z	kuxman		I've got 3 network cards, each registered on my school's network with a static IP.  Each card is limited to 2GB up/down combined a day.  I'm looking for a way to balance my network load (primarally using bittorrent) accross all three cards.  Anyone have any ideas?
2005-12-24T09:21:00.000Z	sethk	kuxman	you need to turn on clustering support in the kernel, and then configure one of the clustering packages.
2005-12-24T09:22:00.000Z	kuxman	sethk	i assume that would require a re-compile of the kernel?  and do you have a suggestion for a clustering package?
2005-12-24T09:22:00.000Z	sethk	kuxman	you can also use something like traffic shaper
2005-12-24T09:22:00.000Z	sethk	kuxman	I've really just glanced at them.  Usually you have to rebuild the kernel, but it's possible that the distribution kernel has it as an unloaded module.
2005-12-24T09:22:00.000Z	kuxman	sethk	thanks, I'll take a look at what I can find
2005-12-24T09:23:00.000Z	sethk	kuxman	there is also support for some intelligent routing protocols.  That's another way to approach it
2005-12-24T09:23:00.000Z	kuxman	sethk	support in the kernel or in ubuntu in general?
2005-12-24T09:23:00.000Z	sethk	kuxman	the kernel.  I'm porting the kernel to a new platform so I've been into the kernel internals all day.  :)
2005-12-24T09:23:00.000Z	sethk	kuxman	in networking, there is support for the border gateway protocol and one or two others
2005-12-24T09:24:00.000Z	kuxman	sethk	sounds like loads of fun :).  I'll stick around... see what I can dig up
2005-12-24T10:09:00.000Z	kuxman	sethk	from what I've dug up... your suggestions for intelligent routing/cluster support require multiple machines... I'm using only one computer with 3 NICs
2005-12-24T10:10:00.000Z	sethk	kuxman	I know.  Let me see if I can find some docs.
2005-12-24T10:10:00.000Z	kuxman	sethk	much appreciated
2005-12-24T10:10:00.000Z	sethk	kuxman	the concept is simlar because you have more than one physical device sharing an IP address
2005-12-24T10:11:00.000Z	kuxman	sethk	right, but i'd be more efficient to not have my network cards talking to eachother... that would slow things down
2005-12-24T10:11:00.000Z	kuxman	sethk	it would be better to have a software solution, that balances the load... round robin style
2005-12-24T10:12:00.000Z	sethk	kuxman	yes, I know, but that way you can only balance connections, not traffic
2005-12-24T10:12:00.000Z	kuxman	sethk	i see... so I'm currently about to give this thing called balance a whirl (found it on sourceforge)... comments?
2005-12-24T10:13:00.000Z	sethk	kuxman	haven't tried it.  let me know what you find.
2005-12-24T10:13:00.000Z	kuxman	sethk	will do... i'm going to have to disconnect and reconnect to irc from my laptop... since i'm going to be playing with the networking on my desktop... bb in a few
2005-12-24T10:25:00.000Z	kuxman	sethk	maybe he's on dial up and doesn't want to download another disk...
2005-12-24T10:25:00.000Z	sethk	kuxman	could be
2005-12-24T10:25:00.000Z	kuxman	sethk	and he doesn't know that he can get CDs sent to him
