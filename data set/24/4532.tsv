2007-05-26T16:41:00.000Z	LOWER_CASE		Hi, can I use a Feisty Fawn CD for a 'Software Update' instead of downloading everyhting from the net, or do I have to boot the CD and *then* do the install?
2007-05-26T05:39:00.000Z	LOWER_CASE		s...Fetching & installing cannot be cancelled.
2007-05-26T05:39:00.000Z	LOWER_CASE		It doesn't say that it we get its files from the CD.
2007-05-26T05:39:00.000Z	LOWER_CASE		THE QUESTION IS:  HOW CAN I BE SURE IT WILL USE THE CD?
2007-05-26T05:40:00.000Z	ompaul	LOWER_CASE	it will where it can
2007-12-25T14:39:00.000Z	ompaul	LOWER_CASE	which version of ubuntu are you using?
2007-12-25T14:40:00.000Z	ompaul	LOWER_CASE	 click on system - about ubuntu
2007-12-25T14:42:00.000Z	LOWER_CASE	ompaul	Ximal, Ubuntu 7.04 - the Feisty Fawn
2007-12-25T14:42:00.000Z	ompaul	LOWER_CASE	so the first thing I ask you do to is to unplug the camera from the machine and put it in a different usb port
2007-12-25T14:43:00.000Z	LOWER_CASE	ompaul	tried, that, also first USB port was the one I use for Flash Sticks...
2007-12-25T14:44:00.000Z	ompaul	LOWER_CASE	so did the camera turn itself on and ask you to "ok" connected to computer?
2007-12-25T14:44:00.000Z	LOWER_CASE	ompaul	also, have used the similar line of cameras at work with Win-XP, so I'm familiar with the cameras themselves.
2007-12-25T14:45:00.000Z	LOWER_CASE	ompaul	no, it didn't, but then it doesn't under Win-XP with no special Canon software installed.
2007-12-25T14:46:00.000Z	ompaul	LOWER_CASE	camera problem check battery - it needs to "wake up" when on usb port or else you can't have the flash inside it mount as a mass storage device
2007-12-25T14:46:00.000Z	ompaul	LOWER_CASE	proof, start applications, accessories, terminal, in there type lsusb and I guess it does not see the device
2007-12-25T14:47:00.000Z	LOWER_CASE	ompaul	fresh batts, & taken ~15 photos this afternoon.
2007-12-25T14:48:00.000Z	LOWER_CASE	ompaul	"Bus 001 Device 001: ID 0000:0000 " <<< same as when unplugged
2007-12-25T14:49:00.000Z	ompaul	LOWER_CASE	your usb on the camera is not talking to the machine - I stick by my earlier call problem on camera end - if it does not show up on lsusb you got no hope of it talking to it - shouting into the void so to speak, pointless exercise
2007-12-25T14:50:00.000Z	LOWER_CASE	ompaul	thanks ... will take to work on 27th & try there... if no go, then will take camera back
2007-12-25T14:51:00.000Z	ompaul	LOWER_CASE	does your machine have or you have card reader?
2007-12-25T14:52:00.000Z	LOWER_CASE	ompaul	no card reader, just some USB memory sticks which work OK
2007-12-25T14:53:00.000Z	ompaul	LOWER_CASE	you could see where that was going, I think you need to find one before you bring it to shop get your photos
2007-12-25T14:55:00.000Z	LOWER_CASE	ompaul	I've got a second machine here, same 7.04, but motherboard is only 18 months old, not about 6 years.  Will try that first.
2007-12-25T15:09:00.000Z	LOWER_CASE	ompaul	thanks for your efforts, but no joy with camera... will try at work on 27th.  BFN. Alf
