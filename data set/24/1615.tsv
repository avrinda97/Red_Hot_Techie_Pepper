2009-10-31T07:55:00.000Z	mdprotacio		 i've got a problem that i don't know how to fix. before i freshly install karmic, whenever i plug in a usb device it is automatically mounted but on karmic it is not the case. hope someone could give me help, please
2009-10-31T07:56:00.000Z	jken146	mdprotacio	In karmic, does your device show up in the output of 'sudo fdisk -l'  ?
2009-10-31T07:58:00.000Z	mdprotacio	jken146	you got my reply?
2009-10-31T07:58:00.000Z	jken146	mdprotacio	Right.  That's weird, but at least you can mount things manually.
2009-10-31T07:58:00.000Z	mdprotacio	jken146	it is very troublesome for me
2009-10-31T07:58:00.000Z	mdprotacio	jken146	it's not supposed to be like that when in jaunty it is not like that
2009-10-31T07:59:00.000Z	jken146	mdprotacio	there might be an option in gconf for automounting that is responsible for that.  I can;t think of what else would be doing it.
2009-10-31T07:59:00.000Z	mdprotacio	jken146	would you know exactly how?
2009-10-31T07:59:00.000Z	jken146	mdprotacio	no.  Look in gconf-editor, or google it even!
2009-10-31T08:00:00.000Z	mdprotacio	jken146	ok thanks
2009-10-31T08:10:00.000Z	mdprotacio	jken146	the problem still persist on my usb
2009-10-31T08:10:00.000Z	mdprotacio	jken146	the usb device is still not automatically mounted even when enabling it on gconf-editor
2009-10-31T08:11:00.000Z	jken146	mdprotacio	hmm, did you change anything in gconf?
2009-10-31T08:13:00.000Z	jken146	mdprotacio	I don't know how it works beyond that level.  Sorry.
2009-10-31T08:13:00.000Z	mdprotacio	jken146	thanks :D
2009-10-31T08:25:00.000Z	mdprotacio	jken146	you know anything about gnome-mount?
2009-10-31T08:25:00.000Z	mdprotacio	jken146	it's not installed by default on karmic?
2009-10-31T08:26:00.000Z	jken146	mdprotacio	is it not?  that's strange.  It should be, I'd have thought.  Install it and see if that does the trick.  IDK anything about it really, but its manpage looks promising
2009-10-31T08:31:00.000Z	mdprotacio	jken146	will gnome-mount work even with devicekit-disks?
2009-10-31T08:31:00.000Z	jken146	mdprotacio	no idea
2009-10-31T08:31:00.000Z	mdprotacio	jken146	or it is only for hal?
2009-10-31T08:31:00.000Z	jken146	mdprotacio	the man page in jaunty says it's for HAL
2009-10-31T08:32:00.000Z	mdprotacio	jken146	aw.. so there is no guarantee that installing gnome-mount will work since 9.10 is using devicekit-disks and not hal
2009-10-31T08:32:00.000Z	jken146	mdprotacio	BTW, stop it with the @ signs please!  This is IRC!
