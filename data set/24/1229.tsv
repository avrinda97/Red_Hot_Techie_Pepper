2010-05-08T22:56:00.000Z	cabbrick1243		Need some help with this one guys... Ok I have the 64 bit version of Lucid on my desktop it runs fine. However... when trying to access any TTY to change the login screen's looks, When Ctrl+Alt+F2 (or any of the F1-6) are pressed all i can see is a bunch of small illegible dots, that move as i type. It doesn't freeze but i would like to know how i can see them?
2010-05-08T22:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cabbrick1243	 seen that issue in the past when the X drivers mess with the framebuffer  or console in some way.  Not sure on a real fix.
2010-05-08T22:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cabbrick1243	 other then perhaps to shutdown X  and they may come back
2010-05-09T00:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cabbrick1243	 part 1 sounds like a typical Plymouth issue. Its using a low-color driver for the system because of your video card.
2010-05-09T00:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cabbrick1243	 the 2nd sounds like a framebuffer/console conflict with the X drivers.
2010-05-09T00:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cabbrick1243	 i dont know of a fix for either one. IVe had similer issues appear and vanish  all during beta
2010-05-09T00:20:00.000Z	cabbrick1243	Dr_Willis	Ok, should i try a reinstall of ubuntu? the card is an Nvidia Geforce 6150 se (or whatever the seconversion is)
2010-05-09T00:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cabbrick1243	 i doubt if that will matter.  some nvidia cards have some issues with Plymouth. thats just how it is.
2010-05-09T00:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cabbrick1243	 You are using the  nvidia drivers from the repos?
2010-05-09T00:22:00.000Z	cabbrick1243	Dr_Willis	Yes i was, i should probably look on their site, but the one problem i've hear with that is the kernel updates will screw it up later on
2010-05-09T00:29:00.000Z	cabbrick1243	Dr_Willis	So... since i cant access the TTY (Virtual Console) do you know any way of changing the logon screen without it?
2010-05-09T00:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cabbrick1243	 the gdm login screen?  thats tweakable a little bit
2010-05-09T00:30:00.000Z	cabbrick1243	Dr_Willis	yes the gdm screen. I don't like the purple background :p
2010-05-09T00:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cabbrick1243	 i got some bookmarks at http://delicious.com/dr_willis
2010-05-09T00:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cabbrick1243	 simple way.. find that image.. edit it... :)
2010-05-09T00:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cabbrick1243	 its in /usr/share/backgrounds  I think. or somewhere in /usr/
2010-05-09T00:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cabbrick1243	 yep. in /usr/share/backgrounds
2010-05-09T00:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cabbrick1243	  i set up grub2 and gdm  and my user to use the same wallpaper
2010-05-09T00:32:00.000Z	cabbrick1243	Dr_Willis	Duh! thanks a lot. I feel like a moron now... Windows mods are like that sometimes to...
2010-05-09T00:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cabbrick1243	 theres other tools to tweak the gdm stuff.. but I just edit/change that ugly picture :) i hate how its the default
2010-05-09T00:33:00.000Z	cabbrick1243	Dr_Willis	Yea, they used to let you change it
2010-05-09T00:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cabbrick1243	 gdm1 vs gdm2.. its changeable still. theres just not a nice gui tool by default.. see the grub2setup tool in my links
2010-05-09T00:36:00.000Z	cabbrick1243	Dr_Willis	Will do. I'm not to familiar with Ubuntu so.. ty
2010-05-09T00:41:00.000Z	cabbrick1243	Dr_Willis	Should i remove plymouth altogether since it doesn't work on my video card you had a link to that on your site and i'm just curiosu
