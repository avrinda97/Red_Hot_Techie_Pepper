2007-05-28T08:22:00.000Z	candyman		i have a really funky problem, my computer wont work right if i dont boot to SU mode and init 5.....if anyone thinks they can help, ill explain in more detail, but its complicated
2007-05-28T08:22:00.000Z	candyman		help would be appreciated :(
2007-05-28T08:23:00.000Z	wols	candyman	either you give a better error description how it is "funky" or no one can help you
2007-05-28T08:24:00.000Z	candyman	wols	it happens in 3 steps....first boot it locks after login and splash, second boot @ splash, 3rd @ graphical init
2007-05-28T08:24:00.000Z	wols	candyman	what "splash"?
2007-05-28T08:25:00.000Z	candyman	wols	the gnome login splash screen
2007-05-28T08:25:00.000Z	wols	candyman	you mean gdm?
2007-05-28T08:25:00.000Z	candyman	wols	correct
2007-05-28T08:25:00.000Z	candyman	wols	ive run fsck, and removed/reinstalled gdm
2007-05-28T08:26:00.000Z	wols	candyman	that's not what I asked. is your "gnome login splash screen" gdm?
2007-05-28T08:26:00.000Z	candyman	wols	yes, i believe so--its that narrow image that comes up and shows stuff loading, right before the desktop fully appears
2007-05-28T08:27:00.000Z	wols	candyman	after you logged in?
2007-05-28T08:27:00.000Z	wols	candyman	always locking at the same place or different ones?
2007-05-28T08:28:00.000Z	candyman	wols	first boot, after desktop shows, second boot, it locks after login, 3rd and subsequent boots it locks as SOON as it switches to tty7
2007-05-28T08:29:00.000Z	wols	candyman	I guess either you have a heat problem or the wrong X driver
2007-05-28T08:30:00.000Z	candyman	wols	heat is a possibility, although im confused as to why that would occur differently on different boots, and reset when i use init 5
2007-05-28T08:30:00.000Z	candyman	wols	my mistake, nvidia-glx-new
2007-05-28T08:30:00.000Z	wols	candyman	try nv drivers, try vesa
2007-05-28T08:31:00.000Z	wols	candyman	no one can really help you with your error unless you reproduce it (or fix it) with a Free driver: everyone will always suspect the nvidia POS driver :)
2007-05-28T08:42:00.000Z	candyman	wols	actually, now it just never gets past switching to tty7, where it goes to graphical mode
2007-05-28T08:43:00.000Z	wols	candyman	I really suspect heat. videocard heat that is
2007-05-28T08:45:00.000Z	candyman	wols	any thoughts on why manually switching to runlevel 5 gets around the issue?
2007-05-28T08:46:00.000Z	wols	candyman	not really, sorry
2007-05-28T08:46:00.000Z	candyman	wols	alright, thanks for yer help, it saves me a lot of trouble
