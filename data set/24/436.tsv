2011-10-23T17:20:00.000Z	no_gravity		Hey! How do I start the "Startup Disk Creator"?
2011-10-23T17:21:00.000Z	no_gravity		Should I install the 32bit or the 64bit version of Ubunut?
2011-10-23T17:23:00.000Z	Polah	no_gravity	If you know your processor model I could tell you. Are you on a version of linux just now?
2011-10-23T17:24:00.000Z	no_gravity	Polah	yes, im on ubuntu right now.
2011-10-23T17:26:00.000Z	Polah	no_gravity	run this: cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep lm
2011-10-23T17:26:00.000Z	no_gravity	Polah	that gives me a ton of stuff
2011-10-23T17:26:00.000Z	Polah	no_gravity	if you get a result with "lm" highlighted in red, then your processor is 64-bit capable.
2011-10-23T17:31:00.000Z	Polah	no_gravity	go with 64. Better future proofing at the very least.
2011-10-23T17:32:00.000Z	no_gravity	Polah	"proofing" ?
2011-10-23T17:32:00.000Z	Polah	no_gravity	Everything is moving towards 64-bit systems now. Thus, if you have a 32-bit system you will have to upgrade to 64-bit at some point to support various programs that require more memory and suchlike.
2011-10-23T17:33:00.000Z	no_gravity	Polah	i have only 2g anyhow...
2011-10-23T17:33:00.000Z	Polah	no_gravity	also there are some small improved processing efficiencies, and a higher virtual memory limit.
2011-10-23T17:33:00.000Z	Polah	no_gravity	yes and? I only have 2GB and I run 64bit. You have a 64-bit capable processor and everything these days is moving away from 32-bit. Thus, it makes sense to use 64-bit.
2011-10-23T17:34:00.000Z	no_gravity	Polah	you keep saying the same, but give no reasons for it.
2011-10-23T17:34:00.000Z	Polah	no_gravity	I just gave you the reasons why...
2011-10-23T17:35:00.000Z	Polah	no_gravity	Everything is moving towards 64-bit, 32-bit systems will be obsolete in a few years or thereabouts. 64-bit processing is a bit more efficient. You will have a much higher memory limit should you wish to improve later. You will have a much higher virtual memory limit for programs. There's a lot of other reasons as well.
2011-10-23T17:35:00.000Z	no_gravity	Polah	i dont use a lot of virtual memory
2011-10-23T17:35:00.000Z	Polah	no_gravity	No. There are lots of benefits, you just seem to be ignoring what we're saying for some foolish reason...
2011-10-23T17:36:00.000Z	Polah	no_gravity	You probably don't think you do, or indeed you might not, but some day you might and then you're in a hole if you're using a 32-bit system...
2011-10-23T17:37:00.000Z	Polah	no_gravity	Please stop being ignorant. We have told you why 64-bit processing is superior to 32-bit. If you don't want to use 64-bit, then you're going to be worse off. It's your choice in the end.
2011-10-23T17:37:00.000Z	no_gravity	Polah	some day? some day there will be ubuntu v17. and i will install that.
2011-10-23T17:38:00.000Z	Polah	no_gravity	Some day in this case is in a year or two, judging by how quickly technology advances and the current moves to 64-bit.
2011-10-23T17:38:00.000Z	Polah	no_gravity	that's because you've decided not to read what we've said.
2011-10-23T17:40:00.000Z	Polah	no_gravity	As I said, "one day" will actually be quite soon.
