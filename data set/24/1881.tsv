2009-07-21T19:03:00.000Z	nerdy_kid		the ftp command returns error 500 Illegal port command
2009-07-21T19:03:00.000Z	ikonia	nerdy_kid	what command are you using exactly
2009-07-21T19:04:00.000Z	nerdy_kid	ikonia	ftp from terminal, I login to my server, can create stuff, it just wont ls or dir the working dir.
2009-07-21T19:04:00.000Z	ikonia	nerdy_kid	sounds like you need passive mode
2009-07-21T19:06:00.000Z	nerdy_kid	ikonia	did that, now im getting error 425 Possible PASV port theft cant open data connection; I have port 21 forworded, maybe do another? 20?
2009-07-21T19:07:00.000Z	ikonia	nerdy_kid	you need 20 and 21 for data and control
2009-07-21T19:08:00.000Z	nerdy_kid	ikonia	hmm I forwarded FTP Protocal in my router, and then forwarded 20 just to make sure, still same
2009-07-21T19:11:00.000Z	nerdy_kid	ikonia	the router says ports Any -> 21 are forwarded using TCP
2009-07-21T19:13:00.000Z	ikonia	nerdy_kid	I'd check that, doesn't seem to be
2010-10-30T01:56:00.000Z	ikonia	nerdy_kid	what ftp daemon are you using ?
2010-10-30T01:57:00.000Z	nerdy_kid	ikonia	vsftpd.  I am trying to access it over LAN and have disabled my firewall.
2010-10-30T01:57:00.000Z	ikonia	nerdy_kid	that error message makes it look like it's not listening on ssl ports
2010-10-30T01:58:00.000Z	ikonia	nerdy_kid	wordpress supports ftp
2010-10-30T01:59:00.000Z	nerdy_kid	ikonia	yeah but I dont want my passwords leaked.  Also, ftp refuses to work over the internet.  Works fine on LAN though.  I forwarded 20 21 already
2010-10-30T01:59:00.000Z	ikonia	nerdy_kid	suggests it's not forwarded properly
2010-10-30T02:10:00.000Z	nerdy_kid	ikonia	any idea why it gives that error?
2010-10-30T02:00:00.000Z	nerdy_kid	ikonia	right, I did a wireshark run on it and it showed random ports being used for encypted communication.  I did it a while ago though.
2010-10-30T02:01:00.000Z	ikonia	nerdy_kid	if flat ftp isn't working, it suggests port forwarding isn't setup right, that would be the first thing I'd resolve
2010-10-30T02:03:00.000Z	nerdy_kid	ikonia	ok, well I killed ssl and am using flat ftp.  It gives the error "500 Illegal PORT command.  ftp: bind: Address already in use"  when accessed over the web.
2010-10-30T02:04:00.000Z	ikonia	nerdy_kid	what command are you using to access it over the internet
2010-10-30T02:04:00.000Z	nerdy_kid	ikonia	ports 21 and 20 are forwarded in my router, I thought that was all ftp needed?
2010-10-30T02:05:00.000Z	nerdy_kid	ikonia	"ftp IP"
2010-10-30T02:05:00.000Z	ikonia	nerdy_kid	that is all it's needed
2010-10-30T02:05:00.000Z	nerdy_kid	ikonia	brb
