2005-10-27T06:02:00.000Z	NixNewby	r0xoR	know something a lil more user friendly i can use, maybe something with a GUI?
2005-10-27T06:02:00.000Z	r0xoR	NixNewby	yeah, it's called the manual ;)
2005-10-27T06:02:00.000Z	r0xoR	NixNewby	no, but for real - burning DVD's is a well covered subject no specific to ubuntu
2005-10-27T06:02:00.000Z	NixNewby	r0xoR	the manual has a GUI, wow yur smart
2005-10-27T06:03:00.000Z	r0xoR	NixNewby	wow - you haven't read the manul for a very well covered topic, you're even smarter
2005-10-27T06:03:00.000Z	r0xoR	NixNewby	K3B is probably what you want
2005-10-27T06:03:00.000Z	NixNewby	r0xoR	why the F would i read a manual on DVD burning when all i wanna do is get breezy installed???
2005-10-27T06:04:00.000Z	r0xoR	NixNewby	you're in the #ubuntu channel - i answered your question
2005-10-27T06:05:00.000Z	r0xoR	NixNewby	had you said that in the first place - my answer would have been different cuz your question would have been different - and even if you did say it... this channel goes fast... it might have scrolled off my screen
2005-10-27T06:05:00.000Z	NixNewby	r0xoR	no you didnt you completely misguided me, telling me to read about DVD burning.. Im asking about installing breezy
2005-10-27T06:05:00.000Z	r0xoR	NixNewby	ask a smart question before you call ME dumb then
2005-10-27T06:06:00.000Z	r0xoR	NixNewby	anyway do you wanna argue with me or do you want an answer to the question
2005-10-27T06:07:00.000Z	r0xoR	NixNewby	your original question i quote "<NixNewby> what software Can i use to format a DVDR???"
2005-10-27T06:07:00.000Z	r0xoR	NixNewby	based on that question - i answered it thinking you were in #ubuntu
2005-10-27T06:07:00.000Z	r0xoR	NixNewby	no you shouldn't be here if all you're going to do is complain about the help your getting
2005-10-27T06:08:00.000Z	r0xoR	NixNewby	drop it
2005-10-27T06:12:00.000Z	r0xoR	NixNewby	so maybe you're calm enough to re-state your question to me? and your full question? because maybe, just maybe, i didn't GET your full question...
2005-10-27T06:12:00.000Z	r0xoR	NixNewby	i'm here to help you - whether you want to beleive otherwise or not
