2008-07-02T21:41:00.000Z	Jaseem		Hi I can't connect to internet using Ubuntu.
2008-07-02T21:42:00.000Z	Jaseem		I am using broadband from BSNL. It had been working with XP perfectly. Now i installed ubuntu and can't use internet in it?
2008-07-02T21:42:00.000Z	Jaseem		I have Automatic IP and it keeps changing.
2008-07-02T21:44:00.000Z	Jaseem		I can see three options.
2008-07-02T21:44:00.000Z	soundray	Jaseem	can you give more detail about your network hardware -- is it a NIC? Modem? Do you have a router?
2008-07-02T21:46:00.000Z	soundray	Jaseem	is this connected to your computer via USB?
2008-07-02T21:50:00.000Z	soundray	Jaseem	the one with the blinking LEDs: is it an RJ45 connection? Look up an image of RJ45 on the web if you are unsure.
2008-07-02T21:52:00.000Z	soundray	Jaseem	and is there another similar cable leading to your telephone socket?
2008-07-02T21:54:00.000Z	soundray	Jaseem	okay. What you seem to have is a combination of a router and a modem.
2008-07-02T21:54:00.000Z	soundray	Jaseem	it's generally more difficult to configure a modem with Linux, so let's try to set it up as a router.
2008-07-02T21:55:00.000Z	soundray	Jaseem	however, I'm a bit worried -- if we try that and it fails, you may lose your internet connectivity in Windows as well...
2008-07-02T21:56:00.000Z	soundray	Jaseem	have you got any documentation for this white box?
2008-07-02T21:57:00.000Z	soundray	Jaseem	can you find out the manufacturer?
2008-07-02T21:59:00.000Z	soundray	Jaseem	I've found some information for it
2008-07-02T22:00:00.000Z	soundray	Jaseem	http://www.utstar.com/Products/Customer_Premise_Equipment/DSL_Modems/UT300R2U/ -- is that it?
2008-07-02T22:04:00.000Z	soundray	Jaseem	it seems that it can be set up as a router. If you can manage that, it'll be easy to use with Linux
2008-07-02T22:05:00.000Z	soundray	Jaseem	no, Windows will work with it as well, once it's set up as a router. You would have to change your network configuration in Windows, though.
2008-07-02T22:06:00.000Z	soundray	Jaseem	it's too bad there isn't any documentation online. I wouldn't risk it without having that.
2008-07-02T22:07:00.000Z	soundray	Jaseem	since your ISP provided the router, could you ask them to supply a manual?
2008-07-02T22:15:00.000Z	soundray	Jaseem	here's what I suggest: ask your internet provider to supply a manual for your router. Then you'll be able to set up the device as a router (rather than as a modem), and you'll be able to use it from both Linux and Windows.
2008-07-02T22:15:00.000Z	soundray	Jaseem	I have to leave you with that -- hope you can fix it.
2008-07-03T16:20:00.000Z	soundray	Jaseem	I told you you had a router
2008-07-03T17:29:00.000Z	soundray	Jaseem	you need to configure your device as a router and configure it as a DHCP server. It's not really an issue that is appropriate to discuss here, as it is not Ubuntu-specific.
2008-07-03T17:31:00.000Z	soundray	Jaseem	meet me in #ubuntu-offtopic
