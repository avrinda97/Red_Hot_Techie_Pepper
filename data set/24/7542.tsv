2004-10-22T16:04:00.000Z	neptho		Can anyone recommend information for one unfamiliar with both the Debian packaging system, and a few years shy on trying to make custom modules work?  I'm trying to build ndiswrapper and wap_supplicant, but without knowing which tree matches the specific kernel installed (since it invaribly gives me a loading probllem), this machine's non-functional until I can get it back on the network.
2004-10-22T16:05:00.000Z	spiv	neptho	apt-get install linux-headers-`uname -r`
2004-10-22T16:05:00.000Z	spiv		Or linux-source-... if you really need to.
2004-10-22T16:06:00.000Z	neptho	spiv	It's a bit hard to do when I have no network.  ;)  Do you know how easy it might be to copy the standard tree to a cdrom to copy across?
2004-10-22T16:06:00.000Z	spiv	neptho	what hardware are you trying to build drivers for?
2004-10-22T16:06:00.000Z	neptho	spiv	Crappy ACX111 based card, and I need WPA, so that leaves ndiswrapper.  :/
2004-10-22T16:06:00.000Z	spiv	neptho	Sure, just grab it out of the apt repo directly via http.
2004-10-22T16:06:00.000Z	neptho		How can I point apt to the CD?  /etc/apt/sources  deb file://...here's where I get lost
2004-10-22T16:07:00.000Z	spiv	neptho	grab the deb by hand from http://archive.ubuntulinux.org/ubuntu/pool/main/l/linux-source-2.6.8.1/
2004-10-22T16:07:00.000Z	neptho		the ndiswrapper built against linux-image-2.6.8.1-3 is both old and broken with my card, so even if I could switch to WEP, it wouldn't work.  :(
2004-10-22T16:07:00.000Z	spiv	neptho	and you can use dpkg -i xxxx.deb to install it.
2004-10-22T16:08:00.000Z	neptho	spiv	Then how do I install it?  apt-get doesn't seem to like localized paths.
2004-10-22T16:08:00.000Z	spiv		(oh, and you should probably build your kernel with the 'kernel-package' package)
2004-10-22T16:08:00.000Z	neptho		You'll have to pardon my ignorance.  I was Slackware for years, went to Gentoo, and entirely missed anything Debian. ;)
2004-10-22T16:08:00.000Z	neptho		kernel... package package.  Right.  :)
2004-10-22T16:08:00.000Z	spiv		<spiv> neptho: and you can use dpkg -i xxxx.deb to install it.
2004-10-22T16:08:00.000Z	spiv		:)
2004-10-22T16:09:00.000Z	neptho		dpkg -i.  Gracias
2004-10-22T16:09:00.000Z	spiv	neptho	kernel-package will install a readme in /usr/share/doc/kernel-package/README.gz, read it with zless to find out how to use it.
2004-10-22T16:10:00.000Z	neptho		Right.  That'll do.  How would I easily mask my system not to follow linux-image-x86 for updates if I manage to get it to actually build?
2004-10-22T16:12:00.000Z	spiv	neptho	remove the linux-image-2.6-686 package (which is a meta-package for grabbing the latest 2.6 kernel)
2004-10-22T16:13:00.000Z	spiv		iirc.
2004-10-22T16:13:00.000Z	spiv	neptho	It should leave your actual linux-image-2.6.8.1-blah package intacct.
2004-10-22T16:13:00.000Z	neptho	spiv	That makes sense.  Thanks.  :)
