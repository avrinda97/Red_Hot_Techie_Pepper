2006-03-07T07:29:00.000Z	brenner	argy	and what does 'hdparm -d /dev/dvd' say?
2006-03-07T07:29:00.000Z	argy	brenner	i set the dma=1 in the hdparm settings
2006-03-07T07:30:00.000Z	brenner	argy	just to confirm, what does the command output?
2006-03-07T07:33:00.000Z	brenner	argy	what do you mean?
2006-03-07T07:34:00.000Z	argy	brenner	it says Couldn't display "/dev/dvd"
2006-03-07T07:35:00.000Z	brenner	argy	then use the correct device instead of /dev/dvd
2006-03-07T07:35:00.000Z	argy	brenner	should i set it to dma=1? when i do
2006-03-07T07:36:00.000Z	brenner	argy	i thought you already did.  i was just trying to check if it really is enabled
2006-03-07T07:36:00.000Z	brenner	argy	-d will check, -d1 will enable
2006-03-07T07:36:00.000Z	argy	brenner	i followed the things to do on the ubuntu site
