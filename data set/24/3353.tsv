2008-06-26T04:39:00.000Z	I440r		ive reinstalled grub boot laoder, ive edited my gurb.conf, i dont know wtf is making this error 2 happen
2008-06-26T04:40:00.000Z	I440r		ive installed ubunto on an external drive. i installed grub ON the external drive, NOT on the internal drive

2008-06-26T04:41:00.000Z	I440r		error 2
2008-06-26T04:42:00.000Z	I440r		when ubunto installed the menu.lst it referred to the external drive as (hd1,1) wihch was correct at the time
2008-06-26T04:42:00.000Z	sammyF	I440r	to see if it can boot from the external drive?
2008-06-26T04:42:00.000Z	I440r		but now... when booting directyly to that drive it will be (hd0,1)
2008-06-26T04:42:00.000Z	I440r		so i edited menu.lst to change all instances of (hd1,1) to (hd0,1)
