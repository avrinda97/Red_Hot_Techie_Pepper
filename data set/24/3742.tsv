2007-10-25T22:19:00.000Z	ccb0x45		no test button

2007-10-25T22:19:00.000Z	ccb0x45		how do you get thre?
2007-10-25T22:19:00.000Z	Pici	ccb0x45	What version of Ubuntu are you running?
2007-10-25T22:20:00.000Z	Pici	ccb0x45	KDE or Gnome?
2007-10-25T22:24:00.000Z	Pici	ccb0x45	you dont. Are you running Gnome or KDE?
2007-10-25T22:24:00.000Z	Pici	ccb0x45	Do you see your Applications, Places and System bar at the top of your screen?
2007-10-25T22:25:00.000Z	Pici	ccb0x45	Or do you see a bar at the bottom with a K on it?
2007-10-25T22:25:00.000Z	Pici	ccb0x45	Okay, Click on System, them Preferences then Sound
2007-10-25T22:27:00.000Z	ccb0x45	Pici	I click applications->settings but theres no preferecnces
2007-10-25T22:27:00.000Z	Pici	ccb0x45	not applications>settings, System>preferences
2007-10-25T22:28:00.000Z	Pici	ccb0x45	1) Watch the language 2) you probably want to try mythtv support
2007-10-25T22:30:00.000Z	Pici	ccb0x45	I dont know what it comes with, I dont know if its gnome or kde or something completely different.
2007-10-25T22:30:00.000Z	Pici	ccb0x45	Thats why I think you should find specific mythbuntu support
2007-10-25T22:30:00.000Z	ccb0x45	Pici	cal you tell from that screenshot? http://www.mythbuntu.org/files/images/7.10_final_desktop.preview.png
2007-10-25T22:31:00.000Z	Pici	ccb0x45	could be xfce, but honestly, I've enver used it.
2007-10-25T22:31:00.000Z	ccb0x45	Pici	xfce that is what it is
2007-10-25T22:31:00.000Z	Pici	ccb0x45	you could try #xubuntu...
2007-10-25T22:31:00.000Z	ccb0x45	Pici	ok thanks
