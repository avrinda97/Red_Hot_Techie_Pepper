2006-03-24T12:26:00.000Z	intelikey		well that's not good. joel886421 with all the modules loaded and no card found.   i'm beginning to think mustard5 was right in saying   'bad card is still possable'    i sujest you power down  pull the sound card and plug it in another slot and see if it changes.....
2006-03-24T12:27:00.000Z	intelikey		yeah
2006-03-24T12:28:00.000Z	intelikey		but if it doesn't work joel886421  you might want to look into getting another card.
2006-03-24T12:29:00.000Z	intelikey		np joel886421
2006-03-24T12:30:00.000Z	na7e	intelikey	me
2006-03-24T12:44:00.000Z	na7e	intelikey	i'm really at a loss as to why someone wouldn't just use gaim.....
2006-03-24T12:45:00.000Z	intelikey	na7e	i'm at a loss why they wrote gaim  or amsn  so that kinda makes us even.
2006-03-24T12:46:00.000Z	na7e	intelikey	??? what's the reasoning?
2006-03-24T12:50:00.000Z	intelikey	na7e	why the  rafb   buuntu has it's own paste bin   !paste
2006-03-24T12:50:00.000Z	na7e	intelikey	meh, rafb is easier to type for me...of course i could just bookmark it
2006-03-24T12:58:00.000Z	na7e	intelikey	it asks for *.6 though, so i dunno
2006-03-25T15:14:00.000Z	na7e	intelikey	i don't know who else to tell so i'm telling you, i think i'm done with my project thats taken me all week
2006-04-12T08:55:00.000Z	intelikey	na7e	phigh ?
2006-04-12T08:56:00.000Z	na7e	intelikey	phigh?
2006-04-12T08:57:00.000Z	intelikey	na7e	with dpkg -p high   priority=high  -phigh   tells the packagemanager to only ask questions with high P
2006-04-12T08:57:00.000Z	na7e	intelikey	well, it's using apt-get
2006-04-12T08:58:00.000Z	intelikey	na7e	man apt-get   and  man dpkg
2006-04-12T08:58:00.000Z	na7e	intelikey	ok
2006-04-12T08:58:00.000Z	na7e	intelikey	yeah, but didn't know one could be set throough the other
2006-04-12T08:59:00.000Z	intelikey	na7e	every thing is installed/setup/ through dpkg
2006-04-12T08:59:00.000Z	na7e	intelikey	yes, but again i wasn't aware you could set debconf priority through apt-get
2006-04-12T09:01:00.000Z	intelikey	na7e	i'm not sure you can,  but i know you can set the debconfig priority and them apt will be affected by that.   so if it can be done that's the place to look.
2006-04-12T09:01:00.000Z	na7e	intelikey	ok, i'll check her out
2006-04-12T09:03:00.000Z	na7e	intelikey	well, i'm gonna go home, thanks for the suggestions, i'll look more into them
