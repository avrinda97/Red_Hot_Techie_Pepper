2007-03-24T07:04:00.000Z	sarixe		I'm running a vnc server from my ubuntu machine, yet i find it's very restrictive in terms of configuration.  it's the default GNOME vino server, and it's way too simplistic for me.  is there a better server out there?
2007-03-24T07:04:00.000Z	blameless	sarixe	restrictive how in configuration?
2007-03-24T07:05:00.000Z	blameless	sarixe	well, then why not use tightvnc for linux?
2007-03-24T07:05:00.000Z	blameless	sarixe	well, ssh in and configure it?
2007-03-24T07:06:00.000Z	blameless	sarixe	essentially yes, with a little more features
2007-03-24T07:06:00.000Z	blameless	sarixe	if i vnc, i tunnel it over ssh to encrypt it
2007-03-24T07:07:00.000Z	blameless	sarixe	and encrypts it
2007-03-24T07:07:00.000Z	blameless	sarixe	i'm ircing over ssh at the moment
2007-03-24T07:07:00.000Z	blameless	sarixe	no, it would be a new login
2007-03-24T07:07:00.000Z	sarixe	blameless	so it would create its own tty?
2007-03-24T07:07:00.000Z	blameless	sarixe	usually yes
2007-03-24T07:07:00.000Z	blameless	sarixe	a pseudo-tty
2007-03-24T07:08:00.000Z	blameless	sarixe	apt-get install openssh-server i believe
2007-03-24T07:08:00.000Z	blameless	sarixe	that would allow you to ssh to the machine, and tinker with the config files
2007-03-24T07:23:00.000Z	blameless	sarixe	vncserver is usually the command
2007-03-24T07:24:00.000Z	sarixe	blameless	but will it actually work from an ssh client?
2007-03-24T07:24:00.000Z	blameless	sarixe	one catch with vncserver in linux is that it doesn't share the same desktop when you're logged int
2007-03-24T07:24:00.000Z	blameless	sarixe	it'll create a new desktop
2007-03-24T07:24:00.000Z	blameless	sarixe	sure, it'll start the daemon in the background, just like starting any other server
2007-03-24T07:24:00.000Z	sarixe	blameless	vnc will create another desktop, similar to the pseudo-tty that ssh made?
2007-03-24T07:25:00.000Z	blameless	sarixe	aye.  vino for gnome and krfb (or something) will share the current logged in users desktop under gnome/kde
2007-03-24T07:25:00.000Z	sarixe	blameless	but a more advanced server will be able to make its own desktop?
2007-03-24T07:26:00.000Z	blameless	sarixe	well, they work in similar ways.  tightvnc starts up its X server to run vnc on
2007-03-24T07:26:00.000Z	sarixe	blameless	then let me try that...
