2008-08-19T08:19:00.000Z	windio00	mneptok	so i could do 2 different root, and the same /home /var /temp /usr for both Oses ?
2008-08-19T08:14:00.000Z	mneptok	windio00	sure.
2008-08-19T08:14:00.000Z	windio00	mneptok	cool . . . do i have to make sure it is ext3?
2008-08-19T08:15:00.000Z	mneptok	windio00	no, format issues are handled locally. just use NFS.
2008-08-19T08:15:00.000Z	windio00	mneptok	wait but wouldn't config files get messy?Ã 
2008-08-19T08:16:00.000Z	windio00	mneptok	like if i had gimp running in openbsd and ubuntu?
2008-08-19T08:16:00.000Z	windio00	mneptok	and local settings for both?
2008-08-19T08:16:00.000Z	mneptok	windio00	that's what happens when you use a ~/ across OSes
2008-08-19T08:17:00.000Z	windio00	mneptok	i only have 40 GB and wanted to consolidate as much as possible
2008-08-19T08:19:00.000Z	mneptok	windio00	i would recommend against /usr
2008-08-19T08:20:00.000Z	windio00	mneptok	doesnt openbsd use a different filesystem though?
2008-08-19T08:20:00.000Z	mneptok	windio00	do you ever use Windows to visit websites hosted on Linux?
2008-08-19T08:21:00.000Z	windio00	mneptok	not ie is insecure
2008-08-19T08:21:00.000Z	windio00	mneptok	not=no
2008-08-19T08:22:00.000Z	mneptok	windio00	think about the question for a minute.
2008-08-19T08:22:00.000Z	windio00	mneptok	yes of course but thats because they both use tcip/ip
2008-08-19T08:23:00.000Z	mneptok	windio00	incorrect. it's because the server daemon handles file read/writes. as does the NFS daemon.
2008-08-19T08:23:00.000Z	windio00	mneptok	if i format one disk ntfs and another ext3 i cant unless i install like ntfs-3g
2008-08-19T08:24:00.000Z	mneptok	windio00	you're talking about locallly accessing the disk. not over a share.
2008-08-19T08:24:00.000Z	windio00	mneptok	im talking about dual booting a laptop with openbsd and disk partitioning
2008-08-19T08:24:00.000Z	mneptok	windio00	oh, i thought you meant "share /home over the network"
2008-08-19T08:25:00.000Z	windio00	mneptok	no i meant have only one /home directory on a dual boot
2008-08-19T08:25:00.000Z	mneptok	windio00	then yes, you'd need an ext3 formatted partition. and OBSD doersn;t play with ext3 too well, from my experience.
2008-08-19T08:26:00.000Z	windio00	mneptok	but swap should work?
