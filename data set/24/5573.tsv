2007-08-14T16:16:00.000Z	Lars_G		I wonder
2007-08-14T16:17:00.000Z	Lars_G		since python-cairo comes with files for python2.5 and 2.4 inside, how come when using 2.5 I get: ImportError: No module named cairo when used with 2.5 ONLY ?
2007-08-14T16:19:00.000Z	jrib	Lars_G	pastebin the result of: python -c 'import sys; print sys.path'
2007-08-14T16:20:00.000Z	Lars_G	jrib	http://rafb.net/p/MO3ErN30.html
2007-08-14T16:20:00.000Z	jrib	Lars_G	python -c 'import cairo'    throws an error?
2007-08-14T16:21:00.000Z	Lars_G	jrib	correct (throws import error)
2007-08-14T16:21:00.000Z	jrib	Lars_G	what does 'dpkg -L cairo' return?
2007-08-14T16:22:00.000Z	jrib	Lars_G	oops, what does 'dpkg -L python-cairo' return?
2007-08-14T16:22:00.000Z	Lars_G	jrib	I'm trying to decypher /etc/python2.5/site.py
2007-08-14T16:23:00.000Z	Lars_G	jrib	http://rafb.net/p/8hPWOT91.html
2007-08-14T16:24:00.000Z	jrib	Lars_G	/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/cairo/__init__.py exists?
2007-08-14T16:25:00.000Z	Lars_G	jrib	bingo. it does not, but 2.4's does
2007-08-14T16:26:00.000Z	Lars_G	jrib	but it's not a symlink to /usr/share/pycentral/python-cairo/site-packages/cairo/__init__.py and not listed in dpkg -L
2007-08-14T16:26:00.000Z	Lars_G	jrib	I wonder, is it copied there by the install script? something reproducible for 2.5 too?
2007-08-14T16:26:00.000Z	jrib	Lars_G	hmm, it should automatically get created when you install python-cairo.  I have it here, so it might be worth a try to just ask it to purge and then reinstall: 'sudo aptitude purge python-cairo && sudo aptitude install python-cairo'
2007-08-14T16:28:00.000Z	Lars_G	jrib	purge is too large a chain of dependencies that will go out and in.
2007-08-14T16:28:00.000Z	jrib	Lars_G	see if 'sudo aptitude reinstall python-cairo' is enough
2007-08-14T16:29:00.000Z	Lars_G	jrib	yes, now it's in neither dir and neither version of python can load it
2007-08-14T16:29:00.000Z	jrib	Lars_G	heh
2007-08-14T16:30:00.000Z	jrib	Lars_G	you're on feisty?
2007-08-14T16:30:00.000Z	Lars_G	jrib	yep
2007-08-14T16:34:00.000Z	jrib	Lars_G	and you're not using any non-ubuntu repos?
2007-08-14T06:01:00.000Z	Lars_G	jrib	Ok. help please :'(
2007-08-14T06:02:00.000Z	jrib	Lars_G	hi, join me in #ubuntu-classroom
