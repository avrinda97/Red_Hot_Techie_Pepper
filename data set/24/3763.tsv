2008-03-16T14:23:00.000Z	thedefender		Bad_Crc: what do you mean by media extender, if you mean a media server there are plenty of ways to do that with mythTV, and there are several linux distros which are made to be just that
2008-03-16T14:25:00.000Z	thedefender		Bad_CrC: and all you want is to be able to? store media, stream it to other pc's? or what
2008-03-16T14:27:00.000Z	thedefender		i'm thinking about giving up and just running ubuntu's outdated (yet stable) FGLRX and then XGL. I had the least graphics problems with that setup but got plagued by random and unprovoked crashes
2008-03-16T14:27:00.000Z	thedefender		everything looked beautiful though
2008-03-16T14:28:00.000Z	lesshaste	thedefender	what's the problem?
2008-03-16T14:30:00.000Z	thedefender	lesshaste	well I wanted to run the open source ATI since its used by default, plus it automatically works in the RT-kernel. I'm running dual heads on a ATI 9800 Pro (R350) and I am having trouble getting Xrandr to work correctly. Also notice some OpenGL issues with screensavers, but compiz runs great.
2008-03-16T14:30:00.000Z	lesshaste	thedefender	ah ok.. I use fglrx and it seems to work perfectly.. so gar
2008-03-16T14:30:00.000Z	lesshaste	thedefender	have you reported a bug?
2008-03-16T14:30:00.000Z	thedefender	lesshaste	what card, are you running dual heads, and compiz
2008-03-16T14:31:00.000Z	lesshaste	thedefender	not dual head.. it radeon express 200
2008-03-16T14:32:00.000Z	thedefender	lesshaste	and the latest FGLRX straight from ATI or the one from Ubuntu Restricted Repos
2008-03-16T14:32:00.000Z	lesshaste	thedefender	exactly
2008-03-16T14:32:00.000Z	lesshaste	thedefender	that one
2008-03-16T14:32:00.000Z	lesshaste	thedefender	but I only upgraded to gutsy last week so I may not be the best person to talk to about this
2008-03-16T14:32:00.000Z	thedefender	lesshaste	there were two choices there
2008-03-16T14:32:00.000Z	lesshaste	thedefender	the latter
2008-03-16T14:32:00.000Z	lesshaste	thedefender	one choice, two alternatives :)
2008-03-16T14:33:00.000Z	lesshaste	thedefender	this is unfortunate..it's always been ok for me
2008-03-16T14:34:00.000Z	lesshaste	thedefender	remember compiz and beryl have been quite buggy themselves
2008-03-16T14:34:00.000Z	thedefender	lesshaste	but apparently people having not only gotten the open source to work with dual heads but they have gotten compiz to work with it as well
2008-03-16T14:35:00.000Z	lesshaste	thedefender	oh...looks like you need to be on a suitable forum
2008-03-16T14:35:00.000Z	lesshaste	thedefender	don't forget to report any bugs you find
2008-03-16T14:35:00.000Z	lesshaste	thedefender	that's very important
