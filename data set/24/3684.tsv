2007-11-17T18:42:00.000Z	marcioapf		"
2007-11-17T18:42:00.000Z	Teknomancer	marcioapf	 has it mounted then ?
2007-11-17T18:43:00.000Z	marcioapf		teknomancer how can i check?
2007-11-17T18:43:00.000Z	Teknomancer	marcioapf	 just do an ls /media/sda1
2007-11-17T18:43:00.000Z	Teknomancer	marcioapf	 see if it has the files in your drive
2007-11-17T18:43:00.000Z	marcioapf		teknomancer oh yes
2007-11-17T18:44:00.000Z	marcioapf		teknomancer but i still can't write to the folder i want
2007-11-17T18:44:00.000Z	Teknomancer	marcioapf	you mounted as root i suppose
2007-11-17T18:44:00.000Z	marcioapf		teknomancer: how can i have mounted as root?
2007-11-17T18:45:00.000Z	Teknomancer	marcioapf	try sudo chmod a+rw /media/sda1 or whatever the location
2007-11-17T18:45:00.000Z	marcioapf		teknomancer i did it
2007-11-17T18:46:00.000Z	Teknomancer	marcioapf	today morning i had such a problem on debian as well, didn't get it to read/write either :(
2007-11-17T18:46:00.000Z	Teknomancer	marcioapf	 i didn't spend enough time trying to fix it , but it should be possible .. i remember doing it before though
2007-11-17T18:51:00.000Z	marcioapf		teknomancer: i got something: the only folders i can't write to are the ones who have a little yellow symbol by them
2007-11-17T18:51:00.000Z	Teknomancer	marcioapf	yellow symbol? dunno , my ubuntu's still downloading havn't installed it yet ;)
2007-11-17T18:53:00.000Z	marcioapf		kalel. don't really know. it's very small. but how can do i became root?
2007-11-17T18:54:00.000Z	marcioapf		kalel the only way i know i typing sudo!
2007-11-17T18:54:00.000Z	marcioapf	juano__	ok. but: i type sudo and what after?
2007-11-17T18:58:00.000Z	marcioapf		kalel: worked =D
2007-11-17T18:59:00.000Z	marcioapf		kalel: thank you too much. But what did this really do?
2007-11-17T19:02:00.000Z	Teknomancer	marcioapf	 i guess you used sudo nautilius to gain root access for writing...
2007-11-17T19:02:00.000Z	Teknomancer	marcioapf	that still hasn't solved the problem of mounting for r/w for user
2007-11-17T19:02:00.000Z	Teknomancer	marcioapf	that's a 'workaround' so to speak ;)
