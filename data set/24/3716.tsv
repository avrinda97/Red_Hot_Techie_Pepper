2007-11-06T06:03:00.000Z	pipegeek		Yeah, actually.... is there any sort of gui fstab-editor in ubuntu?  I haven't found one.... gparted displays mountpoints, but doesn't let you change 'em
2007-11-06T06:03:00.000Z	pipegeek		again, I'm talking gutsy
2007-11-06T06:04:00.000Z	LordKow	pipegeek	fstab is one of those things where if you do not understand the file by looking at it in a text editor then you should probably not change it
2007-11-06T06:04:00.000Z	pipegeek	LordKow	not true.  Some of the basic things in the fstab are things which most people can understand, but they daren't edit the file manually because of the things they *don't* understand
2007-11-06T06:05:00.000Z	LordKow	pipegeek	maybe but i dont want to get the blame for telling someone to edit a file and then their ubuntu is broke.
2007-11-06T06:05:00.000Z	pipegeek	LordKow	anyway, I don't want a gui fstab editor because I need one, I want one because I'm annoyed that I have to fire up vi for something so simple and basic
2007-11-06T06:05:00.000Z	LordKow	pipegeek	nano! :)
2007-11-06T06:05:00.000Z	pipegeek	LordKow	that's the point---let a simple gui frontend do it safely, rather than getting inexperienced users to do it by hand
2007-11-06T06:06:00.000Z	LordKow	pipegeek	ubuntu is setup in such a way that fstab should never need to be edited
2007-11-06T06:06:00.000Z	pipegeek	LordKow	false.  It got it wrong with a few of my non-ubuntu partitions.
2007-11-06T06:07:00.000Z	pipegeek	LordKow	after an upgrade, which it should be able to handle.
2007-11-06T06:07:00.000Z	LordKow	pipegeek	i didnt say ubuntu would setup fstab correctly, it *should* set it up correctly and if it doesnt then a bug report would do swell :)
2007-11-06T06:07:00.000Z	pipegeek	LordKow	anyway, the installer expects the user to know what a mountpoint is, so why hide them from that point on?
2007-11-06T06:07:00.000Z	pipegeek	LordKow	all I'm saying is it seems inconsistent
2007-11-06T06:08:00.000Z	LordKow	pipegeek	its not inconsistent with ubuntu's goals. The goal of ubuntu is to make the linux environment seemingly painless for the average desktop user. the average desktop user does not want to mess with a file like fstab and doesnt want to take the time to learn it
2007-11-06T06:09:00.000Z	pipegeek	LordKow	I'm not saying make something which is a direct analog of the fstab as a gui app---I'm just saying, give the user *some* way to change where filesystems are mounted, and to allow newly-found filesystems to be mounted without root.
2007-11-06T06:10:00.000Z	LordKow	pipegeek	i think newly mounted filesystems are mounted without root?
2007-11-06T06:10:00.000Z	pipegeek	LordKow	users can already edit partitions with gparted, and gparted *tells* them where they're going to be mounted.... wouldn't be too hard to add the ability to change that, given that you can change all the other partition properties listed in gparted
2007-11-06T06:10:00.000Z	pipegeek	LordKow	yeah, on external drives.
2007-11-06T06:11:00.000Z	LordKow	pipegeek	the only problem i see with editing fstab (user aside) is that ubuntu expects certain partitions to be mounted in a particular spot and in a particular way.
2007-11-06T06:12:00.000Z	pipegeek	LordKow	yeah.  So, make those uneditable through the gui
2007-11-06T06:14:00.000Z	LordKow	pipegeek	i dunno i just provided my 2 cents. you could post something in the idea pool section of the ubuntuforums and probably get some better responses
2007-11-06T06:14:00.000Z	pipegeek	LordKow	okie dokie.  Sorry---I like to argue way too much :-\
2007-11-06T06:14:00.000Z	pipegeek	LordKow	didn't meant to shout at you
