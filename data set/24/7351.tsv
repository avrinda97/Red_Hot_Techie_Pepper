2008-08-03T00:15:00.000Z	TsuruyaSan		I was just wondering how you connect to the Interweb on a Comtrend ADSL modem?
2008-08-03T00:16:00.000Z	TsuruyaSan		Sasdly my ISP doesn't use anything else :S
2008-08-03T00:16:00.000Z	ali1234	TsuruyaSan	is it USB?
2008-08-03T00:17:00.000Z	ali1234	TsuruyaSan	if it is ethernet then that's good, you dont need any drivers for it
2008-08-03T00:18:00.000Z	ali1234	TsuruyaSan	well, have you connected a network cable from the modem to your PC?
2008-08-03T00:21:00.000Z	ali1234	TsuruyaSan	DHCP should work by default
2008-08-03T00:21:00.000Z	ali1234	TsuruyaSan	automatic network configuration
2008-08-03T00:22:00.000Z	ali1234	TsuruyaSan	i don't know. need more information :)
2008-08-03T00:22:00.000Z	ali1234	TsuruyaSan	perhaps you need to register your MAC before you can use the modem.
2008-08-03T00:23:00.000Z	ali1234	TsuruyaSan	yes, the MAc address is the unique ID of your network card
2008-08-03T00:23:00.000Z	ali1234	TsuruyaSan	some ISPs require you do visit a special internal webpage yo register your MAC before they let you onto the internet
2008-08-03T00:24:00.000Z	ali1234	TsuruyaSan	the windows software will do it automatically, but under linux normally you can do it manually
2008-08-03T00:24:00.000Z	ali1234	TsuruyaSan	also it could be something else. what ISP is it?
2008-08-03T00:25:00.000Z	ali1234	TsuruyaSan	hang on you said ADSL... this is normally a cable thing so that's probably not it
2008-08-03T00:26:00.000Z	ali1234	TsuruyaSan	does it plug into your phone line or into your TV cable?
2008-08-03T00:29:00.000Z	ali1234	TsuruyaSan	i think it's almost certainly DSL... how are you connecting now BTW?
2008-08-03T00:30:00.000Z	ali1234	TsuruyaSan	yeah i mean, if it doesn't work, how come you are on the internet talking to me about it? ;)
2008-08-03T00:31:00.000Z	ali1234	TsuruyaSan	OK then so you can inspect your windows config, to see how it works, then set up linux the same way (i assume that is what you are trying to do)
2008-08-03T00:32:00.000Z	ali1234	TsuruyaSan	um... in control panel->network connections or similar
2008-08-03T00:33:00.000Z	ali1234	TsuruyaSan	you need to figure out if the modem is really ethernet or USB i think... i'm pretty sure if it was ethernet it would "just work" in linux although possibly not. can you give me the exact model of your modem also? it's normally written on the bottom
2008-08-03T00:34:00.000Z	ali1234	TsuruyaSan	ah i think that modem is a clone of the dlink 302T, which is both USB and ethernet
2008-08-03T00:36:00.000Z	ali1234	TsuruyaSan	not much, if it is, then both should work out of the box with linux
2008-08-03T00:36:00.000Z	ali1234	TsuruyaSan	in any case, you need to go into linux and configure your network cards the same as they are in windows, and that should make it work... if it is ethernet
