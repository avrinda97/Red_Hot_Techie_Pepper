2009-06-16T13:42:00.000Z	Slart	elemeNtttt1	mm.. that's what I get on a fresh install in a vm too
2009-06-16T13:43:00.000Z	Slart	elemeNtttt1	hmm.. is it the same if you run a live cd? have you configured bash in any special way?
2009-06-16T13:44:00.000Z	Slart	elemeNtttt1	oh.. so it's a fresh install?
2009-06-16T13:45:00.000Z	Slart	elemeNtttt1	and if you just type "sudo apt-get install " and then press tab twice you get a list of files in the current folder?
2009-06-16T13:46:00.000Z	elemeNtttt1	Slart	ya
2009-06-16T13:47:00.000Z	Slart	elemeNtttt1	can you pastebin the terminal window after you've tried this?
2009-06-16T13:49:00.000Z	elemeNtttt1	Slart	what command?
2009-06-16T13:50:00.000Z	Slart	elemeNtttt1	after typing sudo apt-get install and pressing tab twice
2009-06-16T13:51:00.000Z	elemeNtttt1	Slart	it shows the same as ls<tab>. I can't really pastebin my contents of my home folder.. :)
2009-06-16T13:52:00.000Z	elemeNtttt1	Slart	also, sudo apt<tab> doesn't become apt-get. but without sudo, it does.
2009-06-16T13:52:00.000Z	Slart	elemeNtttt1	hmm.. and this is a fresh install? not an upgrade?
2009-06-16T13:53:00.000Z	elemeNtttt1	Slart	 Fresh install
2009-06-16T13:53:00.000Z	Slart	elemeNtttt1	installed any software on the system yet?
2009-06-16T13:53:00.000Z	elemeNtttt1	Slart	ya, alot..
2009-06-16T13:55:00.000Z	Slart	elemeNtttt1	hmm.. anything that might affect bash? other shells? anything like that
2009-06-16T13:57:00.000Z	Slart	elemeNtttt1	command autocomplete doesn't work at all with sudo? or is it just apt-get?
2009-06-16T13:57:00.000Z	elemeNtttt1	Slart	sudo shut<tab> doesn't work. but shut<tab> becomes shutdown.. weird
2009-06-16T13:58:00.000Z	Slart	elemeNtttt1	could something have changed the permissions on the bash_completion file? but.. that would work the other way, wouldn't it
2009-06-16T13:58:00.000Z	Slart	elemeNtttt1	or wait.. have you logged in as root?
2009-06-16T13:59:00.000Z	elemeNtttt1	Slart	never logged in as root
2009-06-16T14:01:00.000Z	elemeNtttt1	Slart	found quick fix: complete -cf sudo
2009-06-16T14:01:00.000Z	elemeNtttt1	Slart	but the contents of the current folder also shows up with "sudo apt-get install <tab>"
2009-06-16T14:02:00.000Z	Slart	elemeNtttt1	huh? what is "complete"?? never even heard of it before
