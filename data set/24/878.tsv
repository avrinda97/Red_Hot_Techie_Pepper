2011-02-10T08:42:00.000Z	bonjoyee	skullboy	as in? once you create the usb..it should instll from it like an alternate install cd...i have done it a couple of times..
2011-02-10T08:43:00.000Z	skullboy	bonjoyee	it trys to mount the cdrom not the usb
2011-02-10T08:43:00.000Z	bonjoyee	skullboy	did you use unetbootin to create the usb?
2011-02-10T08:44:00.000Z	skullboy	bonjoyee	yes
2011-02-10T08:44:00.000Z	bonjoyee	skullboy	thats why i specifically said to use startup disk creator...it does not work with unetbootin..same error in my case as well!
2011-02-10T08:46:00.000Z	bonjoyee	skullboy	?
2011-02-10T08:46:00.000Z	bonjoyee	skullboy	yes ..use the ubuntu live cd ..and then use the startup disk creator on it..
2011-02-10T08:47:00.000Z	skullboy	bonjoyee	does the start up disk creator work with usb drives though and isos
2011-02-10T08:47:00.000Z	bonjoyee	skullboy	yes..
2011-02-10T08:58:00.000Z	skullboy	bonjoyee	so would it work if i booted form a live ubuntu on the same flash drive and place the alternet installer on the same flash drive
2011-02-10T08:59:00.000Z	bonjoyee	skullboy	yes...first create the live usb..then copy the alternate iso on it..
2011-02-10T08:59:00.000Z	bonjoyee	skullboy	but the the new bootable usb using the alternate iso has to be on another usb drive...
