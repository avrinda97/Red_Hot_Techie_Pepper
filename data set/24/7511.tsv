2004-11-18T17:05:00.000Z	Witigonen		Okay, I need some help getting my sound working... XMMS when it plays mp3s just blazes through them (no, not using the DiskWriter plugin) and there aren't any system events at all, including login stuff.
2004-11-18T17:06:00.000Z	Treenaks	Witigonen	could you paste the output of "lsmod | grep snd" to www.pastebin.com ?
2004-11-18T17:09:00.000Z	Treenaks	Witigonen	what kind of machine is it?
2004-11-18T17:10:00.000Z	Witigonen	Treenaks	i386.  Or do you want the detailed specs?
2004-11-18T17:10:00.000Z	Treenaks	Witigonen	I mean, is it a laptop, or a desktop, etc.
2004-11-18T17:10:00.000Z	Witigonen	Treenaks	desktop
2004-11-18T17:10:00.000Z	Witigonen	Treenaks	it has a webcam with a microphone via USB plugged in.
2004-11-18T17:11:00.000Z	Witigonen	Treenaks	but sound has been working before.
2004-11-18T17:11:00.000Z	Treenaks	Witigonen	what if you reboot with the webcam unplugged, and only plug it in after booting?
2004-11-18T17:12:00.000Z	Witigonen	Treenaks	let me try that.  brb.
2004-11-18T17:15:00.000Z	Witigonen	Treenaks	that worked, thanks.  Strange that it was working before.
2004-11-18T17:15:00.000Z	Treenaks	Witigonen	it has to do with the order of detection.. for some reason USB audio (from the webcam) is detected _before_ the audio on your mainboard
2004-11-18T17:15:00.000Z	Witigonen	Treenaks	Okay.
2004-11-18T17:16:00.000Z	Witigonen	Treenaks	I don't reboot that often, nor do I use the webcam that often.  So, it's not a big deal.
2004-11-18T17:17:00.000Z	Treenaks	Witigonen	XMMS should be in its default settings..
2004-11-18T17:20:00.000Z	Treenaks	Witigonen	uh, to annoy you? :P
2004-11-18T17:20:00.000Z	Witigonen	Treenaks	well, of course!  Hehe.
2004-11-18T17:20:00.000Z	Treenaks	Witigonen	try beep-media-player, it's a GTK2 version of xmms
2004-11-18T17:20:00.000Z	Treenaks	Witigonen	basically
2004-11-18T17:22:00.000Z	Witigonen	Treenaks	beep works.
2004-11-18T17:24:00.000Z	Witigonen	Treenaks	by uninstalling, removing the .xmms directory from ~/, and reinstalling xmms it now plays perfectly.
2004-11-18T17:24:00.000Z	Treenaks	Witigonen	ok.. well, good luck then
2004-11-20T14:12:00.000Z	Treenaks	Witigonen	NEVER chmod 777!
2004-11-20T14:12:00.000Z	Treenaks	Witigonen	really.. it lets other people write
