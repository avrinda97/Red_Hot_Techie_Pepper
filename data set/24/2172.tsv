2009-10-30T05:37:00.000Z	Andisu		hi, i install the Ubuntu 9, but when i choose ubuntu 9 in grub, my computer restart, anybody can help me?
2009-10-30T05:37:00.000Z	lstarnes	Andisu	9.04 or 9.10?
2009-10-30T05:38:00.000Z	lstarnes	Andisu	I don't know what would cause that.  someone else might
2009-10-30T05:39:00.000Z	Andisu	lstarnes	when i select the location, the time is wrong (-2 hours)
2009-10-30T05:40:00.000Z	lstarnes	Andisu	your computer's hardware clock may be off
2009-10-30T05:40:00.000Z	lstarnes	Andisu	I don't mean "off" as in "not enabled" or "not operating"
2009-10-30T05:40:00.000Z	lstarnes	Andisu	I mean "off" as in "not correct"
2009-10-30T05:42:00.000Z	Andisu	lstarnes	ok i will try access the bios and enable something like this
2009-10-30T05:42:00.000Z	lstarnes	Andisu	there is nothing to enable
2009-10-30T05:42:00.000Z	lstarnes	Andisu	you just need to change your clock's settings
2009-10-30T05:42:00.000Z	lstarnes	Andisu	ubuntu can change the clock for you
2009-10-30T05:42:00.000Z	Andisu	lstarnes	my ubuntu can`t start
2009-10-30T05:42:00.000Z	lstarnes	Andisu	do you have another OS?
2009-10-30T05:43:00.000Z	Andisu	lstarnes	windows 7
2009-10-30T05:43:00.000Z	lstarnes	Andisu	windows and linux use the hardware clock differently
2009-10-30T05:44:00.000Z	lstarnes	Andisu	one expects it to be local time, the other expects it to be UTC/GMT
2009-10-30T05:45:00.000Z	Andisu	lstarnes	uhn..
2009-10-30T05:45:00.000Z	Andisu	lstarnes	hahahaha i active boot recovery in bios and ubuntu start!
2009-10-30T05:46:00.000Z	Andisu	lstarnes	one week trying, thinking the problem was in Ubuntu, and the problem was in BIOS
2009-10-30T05:47:00.000Z	Andisu	lstarnes	but the time is wrong, here now is 23:48 o´clock and my notebook is 21:47
