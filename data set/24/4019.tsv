2007-08-10T08:41:00.000Z	inaety		hello i am trying to install 704 but it is trying to download my package lists and well i have no internet connected..
2007-08-10T08:41:00.000Z	inaety		how can i have it skipped?
2007-08-10T08:43:00.000Z	Pelo	inaety	that is not a problem just make sure your installation cd is in the drive and it will get the packages from there
2007-08-10T08:44:00.000Z	inaety	Pelo	i know but it's been chillin here for 20 minutes
2007-08-10T08:44:00.000Z	Pelo	inaety	 you need to   apt-get update after you put in the cd
2007-08-10T08:45:00.000Z	inaety	Pelo	yes after i have my internet going...but right now i cant get it installed
2007-08-10T08:46:00.000Z	Pelo	inaety	I thnk I am a bit confused ? you are doing a clean install wtih a live cd and it is trying to dl packages from the net ?  that doesn't sound right at all
2007-08-10T08:47:00.000Z	inaety	Pelo	i popped in the livecd, i am NOT connected to the internet but it says "downloading package lists..."
2007-08-10T08:49:00.000Z	Pelo	inaety	 on an installed system ?  sorry If I'm making you repeat but I'm trying to figure it out,  I can tell you this,  on an installed system,  if you put in the live cd ( the first time you do it after the installation)  ubuntu will recognise it and try to add it to the list of repos  and update the package list accordingly,  is this what is going on ?
2007-08-10T08:50:00.000Z	inaety	Pelo	no no there is no system..completely formatted system and all that it...i ticked Install, it's installed but now it wants to the final stuff (grub, etc etc) and one of those is download the package lists for apt-get however i dont have the internet running, thus the connection should time out after like a minute or whatever and it's well not.  it's still responding and everything just not continuing the install
2007-08-10T08:52:00.000Z	Pelo	inaety	 I think I get see what is happening but I have no idea what is going on , sorry,  everyting you need should be on the live cd it shouldn'T be trying to connect to the internet to install anything, even if your computer was connected
2007-08-10T08:53:00.000Z	inaety	Pelo	good news, i fixed the wifi we're good now
2007-08-12T13:04:00.000Z	Pelo	inaety	open mplayer from the menu with no files,   right click properties, video tab, use the modul that starts with x11/opengl
2007-08-12T13:05:00.000Z	inaety	Pelo	now i get a bunch more errors
2007-08-12T13:05:00.000Z	Pelo	inaety	which are they , we can deal with them one at a time
2007-08-12T13:06:00.000Z	inaety	Pelo	the first one that comes up is "Mplayer interrupted by signal 11 in module: init_audio_codec"
2007-08-12T13:06:00.000Z	Pelo	inaety	goto prefs  audio make sure alsa is the one selected
2007-08-12T13:07:00.000Z	Pelo	inaety	 btw I 'm not sure it is possible to play a rmv file in mplayer
2007-08-12T13:07:00.000Z	inaety	Pelo	it is i've done it before
2007-08-12T13:07:00.000Z	Pelo	inaety	maybe the ppl in #mplayer can help you better
2007-08-12T13:11:00.000Z	inaety	Pelo	would you happen to know what to do with a .bin installer?
2007-08-12T13:19:00.000Z	Pelo	inaety	yes sorry I was afk,  put it on you desktop,    open the termina.   cd Desktop   ,  sudo chmod 777 filename,bin             sudo ./filename.bin    remember linux is case sensitive
2007-08-13T06:54:00.000Z	Pelo	inaety	ask in #kubuntu  they know about kde stuff
2007-08-13T06:54:00.000Z	inaety	Pelo	no one has been answering :P
