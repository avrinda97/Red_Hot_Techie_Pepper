2010-05-29T09:07:00.000Z	phlak_user	faisal	hangon let me look
2010-05-29T09:11:00.000Z	phlak_user	faisal	looks like that wireless card has an atheros chip
2010-05-29T09:12:00.000Z	phlak_user	faisal	can you paste the output of lsmod here--> paste.ubuntu.com?
2010-05-29T09:24:00.000Z	phlak_user	faisal	when you click the network manager , does it show list of available wifi access points?
2010-05-29T09:27:00.000Z	phlak_user	faisal	paste.ubuntu.com
2010-05-29T09:30:00.000Z	phlak_user	faisal	yes i saw that; it says intel corporation WiFi link 100 series
2010-05-29T09:32:00.000Z	phlak_user	faisal	seems you need to download the 1000bgn microcode from http://intellinuxwireless.org/?n=Downloads, extract it and copy it to /lib/firmware/
2010-05-29T09:38:00.000Z	faisal	phlak_user	its says You do not have the right permissions to extract archives in the folder "file:///lib/firmware
2010-05-29T09:38:00.000Z	phlak_user	faisal	you have to use gksu or sudo
2010-05-29T09:47:00.000Z	phlak_user	faisal	did that work?
2010-05-29T09:51:00.000Z	phlak_user	faisal	did you manage to extract and copy that file you downloaded into this directory?
2010-05-29T09:52:00.000Z	phlak_user	faisal	which is why is asked you to type sudo before the copy command; eg. sudo cp file-to-be-copied /lib/firmware/
2010-05-29T10:00:00.000Z	phlak_user	faisal	im sorry too many people are pulling you in different directions; cant focus
