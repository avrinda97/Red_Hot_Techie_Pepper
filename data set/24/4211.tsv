2007-06-09T08:40:00.000Z	Lapinux		can anyone tell me how i go about changing permissions on a disk that has been mounted?  i tried running "gksudo nautilus" but then i dont see the volume in "computer:///"
2007-06-09T08:41:00.000Z	AposteRiori	Lapinux	chmod (and magic seven) 777 directory
2007-06-09T08:44:00.000Z	Lapinux	AposteRiori	I'm not sure I know how to go about that exactly....
2007-06-09T08:46:00.000Z	AposteRiori	Lapinux	You have few options, you can go to gksu nautilus, go to properties, and set permission
2007-06-09T08:46:00.000Z	AposteRiori	Lapinux	or you can edit fstab and put options user, rw to path of mounting disk
2007-06-09T08:47:00.000Z	AposteRiori	Lapinux	last (in my knowledge) is go (by terminal) to example /media
2007-06-09T08:47:00.000Z	Lapinux	AposteRiori	i tried gksudo nautilus but then i dont see the volume in "computer:///" like i do when i launch natilus normally
2007-06-09T08:48:00.000Z	AposteRiori	Lapinux	you going to mount point example /media/my_disk
2007-06-09T08:48:00.000Z	AposteRiori	Lapinux	if you are not sure where - mount -f in terminal
2007-06-09T08:50:00.000Z	Lapinux	AposteRiori	its mounted at /media/disk, so i assume i change permissions on that dir
2007-06-09T08:51:00.000Z	AposteRiori	Lapinux	yes
2007-06-09T08:52:00.000Z	Lapinux	AposteRiori	ok, it will let me read and write to that drive now, any idea how i change the name of that volume under computer:/// ?
2007-06-09T08:53:00.000Z	AposteRiori	Lapinux	coputer:/// is just link
2007-06-09T08:53:00.000Z	Lapinux	AposteRiori	right, and under that i see the volume, i want to change how its named under that but it tells me i dont have permission
2007-06-09T08:54:00.000Z	AposteRiori	Lapinux	it'is impossible on runing mount
2007-06-09T08:56:00.000Z	AposteRiori	Lapinux	do sudo umount /dev/(letter), mkdir /media/(your choice) , and mount /dev/(letter) /media/(your choice)
2007-06-09T08:57:00.000Z	Lapinux	AposteRiori	right, i understand that i can have it mount where ever i want but is there a way to rename the shortcut under computer:/// that points to the mount point
2007-06-09T08:58:00.000Z	Lapinux	AposteRiori	im trying to set up a nice clean, easy to understand list of shortcuts under computer:/// that will point to all my mount points so users dont have to browse to the dir's and can just use computer:///
2007-06-09T08:59:00.000Z	AposteRiori	Lapinux	do you use windows? remember shortcut, ?
2007-06-09T09:01:00.000Z	AposteRiori	Lapinux	edit your fstab
2007-06-09T09:02:00.000Z	AposteRiori	Lapinux	you eventually must do restart to apply changes ;)
2007-06-09T09:02:00.000Z	Lapinux	AposteRiori	yes, im looking at fstab now, dont see anything about that drive yet
2007-06-09T09:03:00.000Z	AposteRiori	Lapinux	go to /etc/fstab
2007-06-09T09:03:00.000Z	Lapinux	AposteRiori	im there, looking at it now
