2006-08-25T12:16:00.000Z	Drako60		is there a channel specifically for Ubuntu 64?
2006-08-25T12:16:00.000Z	JackMacOKC	Drako60	i don't believe so
2006-08-25T12:18:00.000Z	JackMacOKC	Drako60	i have 64bit proc, but am using 32bit ubuntu..a lot more packages built for it, so its a little less headache. unless you havea specific need for 64bit, no real reason to use it.
2006-08-25T12:20:00.000Z	Drako60	JackMacOKC	mine aren't exactly specific, but i do alot of encoding and 64-bit is faster, if i could get UDMA turned on for some reason it won't let me no matter what i do
2006-08-25T12:20:00.000Z	JackMacOKC	Drako60	i think even for encoding, the performance boost you'll see using the 64bit kernel is negligle
2006-08-25T12:21:00.000Z	Drako60	JackMacOKC	in a properly configured system encoding can be increased by 10%
2006-08-25T12:22:00.000Z	JackMacOKC	Drako60	i suppose if thats all you do, then it would be worth it, but i haven't seen real good benchmarks to suggest that
2006-08-25T12:23:00.000Z	Drako60	JackMacOKC	well i don't rely on benchmarks, but real world experiance, and from what i've experianced i've gotten a 5-10% increase atleast, but there definant disadvantages to 64-bit userland, one of which is my current DMA problem
2006-08-25T12:24:00.000Z	JackMacOKC	Drako60	so whats the issue with your udma? what have you tried thus far? i need to tweak my udma settings myself. something i haven't done yet
2006-08-25T12:25:00.000Z	Drako60	JackMacOKC	UDMA gets turned off right away, befor it even starts checking the root FS, and i can't turn it on
2006-08-25T12:26:00.000Z	Drako60	JackMacOKC	i've tried hdparm which says operation not allowed, the kernel i compiled won't boot unless i tell it the initrd.img, kernel panic "Not Syncing: VFS Unknown root FS on unkown-block(0,0)
2006-08-25T12:27:00.000Z	Drako60	JackMacOKC	if i tell it the initrd.img the kernel panic stops
2006-08-25T12:29:00.000Z	Drako60	JackMacOKC	i didn't have this problem with NForce3, its just since i switched to a VIA VT8237 AM2 board that its started, upgraded to a AMD64 x2
2006-08-25T12:31:00.000Z	Drako60	JackMacOKC	my dmesg does report "VP-IDE Unknown VIA Southbridge, disabling DMA"
2006-08-25T12:33:00.000Z	JackMacOKC	Drako60	have you got sdparm?, not hdparm?
2006-08-25T12:34:00.000Z	JackMacOKC	Drako60	or are you using regular IDE drives
2006-08-25T12:34:00.000Z	Drako60	JackMacOKC	i have both PATA and SATA drives, not sure if i had sdparm or not, so yeah regular IDE and SATA
2006-08-25T12:37:00.000Z	Drako60	JackMacOKC	looks like there might be a patch
2006-08-25T12:39:00.000Z	JackMacOKC	Drako60	is ubuntu installed on your pata or sata drive?
2006-08-25T12:40:00.000Z	Drako60	JackMacOKC	pata
2006-08-25T12:40:00.000Z	Drako60	JackMacOKC	check https://launchpad.net/distros/baltix/+source/linux-source-2.6.15/+bug/55929
2006-08-25T12:41:00.000Z	JackMacOKC	Drako60	ahh, yes, indeed....will be part of edgy
2006-08-25T12:44:00.000Z	Drako60	JackMacOKC	any idea on the kernel panic?
2006-08-25T12:45:00.000Z	JackMacOKC	Drako60	no, sorry.
