2010-10-11T08:39:00.000Z	Phrosty1		hello
2010-10-11T08:39:00.000Z	Phrosty1		nite
2010-10-11T08:39:00.000Z	Stormx2	Phrosty1	/boot is something that'll reside on your /dev/sda3. People sometimes put them on a seperate partition for a couple of reasons, but you won't need to
2010-10-11T08:39:00.000Z	Phrosty1		so the windows partition is ok the way it is? grub will definitely recognize it?
2010-10-11T08:39:00.000Z	Phrosty1		i'm ready to install?
2010-10-11T08:40:00.000Z	Stormx2	Phrosty1	it's not guaranteed it'll recognise it, but it's easily fixed, so just go ahead and install
2010-10-11T08:40:00.000Z	Phrosty1		ok thanks
2010-10-11T08:40:00.000Z	Phrosty1		i'm gonna try to install now
2010-10-11T08:40:00.000Z	Phrosty1		wish me luck :D
2010-10-11T08:40:00.000Z	Stormx2	Phrosty1	my fingers are all crossed
