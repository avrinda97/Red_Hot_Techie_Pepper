2008-07-09T06:35:00.000Z	glitsj16	krsnadasa	you might try #compiz-fusion for help with your burn effect performance issue
2008-07-09T06:35:00.000Z	krsnadasa	glitsj16	but its not a compiz problem
2008-07-09T06:36:00.000Z	krsnadasa	glitsj16	i think it has to do with ubuntu and driver and optimization
2008-07-09T06:36:00.000Z	glitsj16	krsnadasa	just pointing out that there's an alternative channel to try since nobody here seems to have a clue :)
2008-07-09T06:36:00.000Z	krsnadasa	glitsj16	lol thanks
2008-07-09T06:37:00.000Z	krsnadasa	glitsj16	they are all dead in that channel though ;)
2008-07-09T21:17:00.000Z	glitsj16	krsnadasa	don't you have an entree in your menu somewhere 'emerald theme manager' ? you change themes from there
2008-07-09T21:18:00.000Z	krsnadasa	glitsj16	i got it but it don't change the theme
2008-07-09T21:18:00.000Z	krsnadasa	glitsj16	unless i am missing something ?
2008-07-09T21:18:00.000Z	glitsj16	krsnadasa	emerald is running at the moment ?
2008-07-09T21:18:00.000Z	krsnadasa	glitsj16	*shug* i don't know ?
2008-07-09T21:19:00.000Z	krsnadasa	glitsj16	how do i check ?
2008-07-09T21:19:00.000Z	glitsj16	krsnadasa	try entering "emerald --replace &" from terminal to check
2008-07-09T21:20:00.000Z	krsnadasa	glitsj16	that worked ;)
2008-07-09T21:20:00.000Z	krsnadasa	glitsj16	but how do i get it to do that automagicaly ?
2008-07-09T21:21:00.000Z	glitsj16	krsnadasa	add that command to your system > admoin > sessions so it autostarts
