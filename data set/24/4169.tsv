2007-09-19T07:16:00.000Z	kravlin		anyone know how to get stage6 to work with Ubuntu 64? MediaPlayerConnectivity doesn't work...
2007-09-19T07:16:00.000Z	Pelo	kravlin	what is stage6 ?
2007-09-19T07:16:00.000Z	kravlin	Pelo	its a video hosting site that hosts videos in Xvid.
2007-09-19T07:17:00.000Z	kravlin	Pelo	I'm trying to run it through tvlinks.
2007-09-19T07:17:00.000Z	Pelo	kravlin	are you using a player in ff to do this ? which one ?
2007-09-19T07:17:00.000Z	kravlin	Pelo	yeah. I've tried VLC, gxine and totem.
2007-09-19T07:18:00.000Z	Pelo	kravlin	 not as a plugin in ff I take it , well you still hve mplayer to try out
2007-09-19T07:18:00.000Z	kravlin	Pelo	and its divx not xvid. JoCol just corrected me.
2007-09-19T07:19:00.000Z	Pelo	kravlin	doesn't matter to me,  I'm just trying to figure out if you are streaming in a stand alone player or using a Firefox plugin
2007-09-19T07:19:00.000Z	kravlin	Pelo	its a plugin that directs the stream to a stand alone player.
2007-09-19T07:20:00.000Z	kravlin	Pelo	and switching to Mplayer just killed it off.
2007-09-19T07:20:00.000Z	Pelo	kravlin	ic, I think,  well try giving mplayer a shot it's pretty good,  you might also want to ask the ppl in the various channels for the players you tried
2007-09-19T07:21:00.000Z	kravlin	Pelo	i was more thinking that its probably because i'm using ubuntu 64 bit because it worked with 32 bit.
2007-09-19T07:22:00.000Z	Pelo	kravlin	 64 bit has several issues, we generaly tell ppl to use the 32bit versions unless they NEED a 64 bit os
2007-09-19T07:22:00.000Z	kravlin	Pelo	unfortunately i've been using the 64 bit for somewhere around 4 months now... I don't want to switch for no reason.
2007-09-19T07:24:00.000Z	Pelo	kravlin	check the forum for info on using firefox 32 bit in the 64 bit os,  it might give hyou a clue on how to get the 32 bit libs needed to run the plugin you need
2007-09-19T07:24:00.000Z	kravlin	Pelo	i'm running the 32 bit version of Iceweasel..
2007-09-19T07:25:00.000Z	Pelo	kravlin	then try and figure out what the libs that you need are to run that pluggin and get the 32 bit ones  , that's the best I can do for you
2007-09-19T07:26:00.000Z	kravlin	Pelo	would the error from gxine help? it says that the xine engine failed to start.
2007-09-19T07:26:00.000Z	kravlin	Pelo	and fails to find the file.
2007-09-19T07:26:00.000Z	Pelo	kravlin	It wouldn'T help me figure it out , try reinstalling
2007-09-19T07:27:00.000Z	kravlin	Pelo	ok.... I guess i'll just avoid stage6. I'm not in a position to reinstall without any kind of serious time loss.
2007-09-19T07:28:00.000Z	Pelo	kravlin	 you could dual boot , jsut make another partiton for 32 bit and use the same /home
2007-09-19T07:29:00.000Z	kravlin	Pelo	currently i dual boot with windows. but I need to use linux currently so i don't worry about it too much. Its just one of those things i wish i had.
