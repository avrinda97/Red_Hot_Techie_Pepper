2009-06-23T20:18:00.000Z	spaceball1		Oh, and also, if I do Ctrl-Alt-Del, the screen fades out.  If I do Ctrl-Alt-Del again, I see a "unlock screen" windows.  I can type in the window and unlock the screen.
2009-06-23T20:19:00.000Z	legend2440	spaceball1	if your menus and panels are missing try opening terminal  and type   xfce4-panel
2009-06-23T20:19:00.000Z	spaceball1	legend2440	Any idea how to open a terminal?
2009-06-23T20:20:00.000Z	legend2440	spaceball1	alt+f2
2009-06-23T20:20:00.000Z	spaceball1	legend2440	Hmm... I don't think that worked for me.. I can try again...
2009-06-23T20:21:00.000Z	spaceball1	legend2440	(I mean Alt-F2 didn't seem to switch screens)
2009-06-23T20:22:00.000Z	legend2440	spaceball1	alt+f2 should pop up a box called Run Application
2009-06-23T20:22:00.000Z	spaceball1	legend2440	But thanks for the xfce4_panel tip.
2009-06-23T20:22:00.000Z	spaceball1	legend2440	Ah!
2009-06-23T20:22:00.000Z	spaceball1	legend2440	Thanks, that sounds like a good guess.  I'm going to have to leave irc to try this.  xfce4_panel was the command you recommend?  With no flags?
2009-06-23T20:23:00.000Z	legend2440	spaceball1	xfce4-panel   with no flags
2009-06-23T20:24:00.000Z	spaceball1	legend2440	Thanks; I'll give that a go.  Thanks all; hopefully I'll sign in again with a working X...
2009-06-23T20:28:00.000Z	spaceball1		legend: It worked!
2009-06-23T20:29:00.000Z	legend2440	spaceball1	good but unfortunately next time you reboot they may disappear again
2009-06-23T20:29:00.000Z	spaceball1		Thanks!  I don't know why xfce4-panel did not start up, but typing it in a terminal brought it back up.
2009-06-23T20:29:00.000Z	legend2440	spaceball1	good but unfortunately next time you reboot they may disappear again
2009-06-23T20:30:00.000Z	spaceball1		legened2440: Right; I'll try to figure out what happened.  But at least I can switch windows now and use firefox, etc.
2009-06-23T20:37:00.000Z	legend2440	spaceball1	read third post from bottom by Billi this is how he got xfce-panel to start on boot    http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-415082.html
2009-06-23T20:44:00.000Z	spaceball1		https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xfce4-panel/+bug/53897 mentions the same issue I ran into.
2009-06-23T20:48:00.000Z	legend2440	spaceball1	just curious why you don't just use Gnome instead?
2009-06-23T20:49:00.000Z	spaceball1	legend2440	Because I didn't know any better at the time; I was seeking a light-weight easy-to-use distro.  This system is circa 2002.
2009-06-23T20:50:00.000Z	spaceball1	legend2440	I may indeed switch the window manager to gnome at this point, though.
2009-06-23T20:50:00.000Z	legend2440	spaceball1	ok wel if you wanted to try Gnome you can follow instructions on this page for removing xubuntu and installing Gnome   http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/puregnome
2009-06-23T20:51:00.000Z	spaceball1	legend2440	Thanks again.
