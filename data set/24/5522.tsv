2006-06-17T12:32:00.000Z	a_l_e_		i've read that dapper supports booting on an external disk (usb in my case) out of the box... can anybody confirm this?
2006-06-17T12:34:00.000Z	a_l_e_		"please append a correct "boot=" boot option
2006-06-17T12:34:00.000Z	Jowi	a_l_e_	you are probably not having the correct entry in grub
2006-06-17T12:36:00.000Z	Jowi	a_l_e_	for example. "root (hd0,4)" should have the corresponding "root=/dev/hda5" in the list
2006-06-17T12:37:00.000Z	Jowi	a_l_e_	for example. "root (hd0,4)" should have the corresponding "root=/dev/hda5" in the list
2006-06-17T12:57:00.000Z	Jowi	a_l_e_	just left to soon. what is the exact /dev/ path for the ubs-key?
2006-06-17T12:59:00.000Z	a_l_e_	Jowi	it's a usb disk... /dev/sda; root is on /dev/sda4
2006-06-17T13:00:00.000Z	Jowi	a_l_e_	how many harddisks do you have connected?
2006-06-17T13:02:00.000Z	Jowi	a_l_e_	how many harddisks do you have connected? <--- important in order to know how to mount the usb
2006-06-17T13:02:00.000Z	Jowi	a_l_e_	if you have only 1 harddisk then "root (hd1,3)" and for the kernel option "root=/dev/sda4"
2006-06-17T13:02:00.000Z	a_l_e_	Jowi	1 external
2006-06-17T13:02:00.000Z	Jowi	a_l_e_	how many internal?
2006-06-17T13:03:00.000Z	a_l_e_	Jowi	i think that the most important informations are about the support for booting on external disk in the kernel and how to check for it
2006-06-17T13:03:00.000Z	a_l_e_	Jowi	i'm on ppc... so no grub but yaboot
2006-06-17T13:03:00.000Z	Jowi	a_l_e_	if the BIOS can see your external disk then it should work.
2006-06-17T13:04:00.000Z	a_l_e_	Jowi	most of the things are the same, but all of them
2006-06-17T13:04:00.000Z	Jowi	a_l_e_	that make it harder. never tried yaboot
2006-06-17T13:04:00.000Z	a_l_e_	Jowi	the bios (ok, it's not a bios... openfirmware here) sees the disk and boots from there. but then yaboot (the grub) doesn't succeed in loading the kernel
2006-06-17T13:05:00.000Z	a_l_e_	Jowi	so my question is more: how can i check if the support for booting on usb is enable.
2006-06-17T13:06:00.000Z	Jowi	a_l_e_	then, theoreticly, it should work fine. i don't know what is enabled or not in the ppc kernel. sorry
2006-06-17T13:06:00.000Z	a_l_e_	Jowi	ok, thanks for caring! :-)
2006-06-17T13:08:00.000Z	Jowi	a_l_e_	the option should be listed in /boot/config-ppcnumbergoeshere (you can "cat" it) but I have no idea what to look for
2006-06-17T13:33:00.000Z	a_l_e_	Jowi	i'll try to load the initrd file... maybe it chances something :-)
2006-06-17T13:35:00.000Z	Jowi	a_l_e_	:)
