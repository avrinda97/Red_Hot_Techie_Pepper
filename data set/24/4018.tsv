2007-08-03T15:01:00.000Z	hadron		urgent help needed. I'm stuck in recovery mode. An upgrade has screwed up. Can someone please tell me how to reset apt-get as currently I cant install dbus.
2007-08-03T15:02:00.000Z	hadron		anyone?
2007-08-03T15:03:00.000Z	Xenoie`	hadron	what do you mean by reset apt-get?
2007-08-03T15:03:00.000Z	hadron	Xenoie`	I cant install because of dependency issues.
2007-08-03T15:04:00.000Z	Xenoie`	hadron	what is the missing dependency?
2007-08-03T15:05:00.000Z	hadron	Xenoie`	the error I get is this (if you could google as solution I would be grateful) "dbus-uuidgen:symbol lookup error: /usr/bin/dbus-uuidgen:undefined symbol: dbus_internal:do_not_use_get_uuid
2007-08-03T15:07:00.000Z	Xenoie`		hadrun, and you are trying to reinstall dbus, correct?
2007-08-03T15:07:00.000Z	Xenoie`	hadron	nothing from google btw
2007-08-03T15:07:00.000Z	hadron	Xenoie`	rats. Any ideas?
2007-08-03T15:08:00.000Z	Xenoie`		hadrun, you could download the package and install it manually, and force if needed, but you should probably uninstall and then reinstall rather then force.
2007-08-03T15:08:00.000Z	hadron	Xenoie`	what do I need to do? I have only command line here.
2007-08-03T15:09:00.000Z	Xenoie`	hadron	you are attempting to install dbus, correct?
2007-08-03T15:09:00.000Z	Xenoie`		or reinstall it
2007-08-03T15:09:00.000Z	hadron	Xenoie`	yes. Or that is whats causing the rest of the install to abort. I need to force a reinstall of dbus,
2007-08-03T15:10:00.000Z	Xenoie`	hadron	is this feisty or an older version?
2007-08-03T15:11:00.000Z	hadron	Xenoie`	feisty
2007-08-03T15:12:00.000Z	Xenoie`	hadron	and your system arch, x86, amd64, etc?
2007-08-03T15:15:00.000Z	hadron	Xenoie`	x86

2007-08-03T15:19:00.000Z	hadron	Xenoie`	I got nothing.
2007-08-03T15:20:00.000Z	hadron	Xenoie`	if you could public post the wget line to get the package I would be grateful
