2005-06-26T09:15:00.000Z	Danar		um, i need some help...
2005-06-26T09:15:00.000Z	Danar		i'm trying to use gparted to resize a partition, and something went wrong
2005-06-26T09:16:00.000Z	Danar		it said there was an error, that it was trying to act on a busy device
2005-06-26T09:16:00.000Z	Danar		said it was mounted
2005-06-26T09:16:00.000Z	Danar		but i checked before that and made sure it wasn't mounted. and even used lsof to make sure nothing was using it
2005-06-26T09:16:00.000Z	Seveas	Danar	you cannot resize partitions that are mounted, try using parted from a livecd
2005-06-26T09:17:00.000Z	Danar	Seveas	i am
2005-06-26T09:17:00.000Z	Seveas	Danar	hmm...
2005-06-26T09:18:00.000Z	Seveas	Danar	if they don't show up in /dev the system doesn't recognize them...
2005-06-26T09:18:00.000Z	Danar	Seveas	but gparted still sees them
2005-06-26T09:25:00.000Z	Seveas	Danar	do not paste in here....
2005-06-26T09:25:00.000Z	Seveas	Danar	even a few lines are a lot when it's busy...
2005-06-26T09:44:00.000Z	Seveas	Danar	you can use umount to unmount the swap partition. Then it's no longer 'in use'
2005-06-26T11:43:00.000Z	Seveas	Danar	that's not possible, you need to boot into a real windows system
2005-06-27T06:07:00.000Z	Danar	Seveas	i think he said the problem was with his nvidia drivers, not kde, so you might be able to help...
2005-06-27T06:50:00.000Z	Danar	Seveas	'mp3 related badness'?
2005-06-27T06:50:00.000Z	Seveas	Danar	mp3 is tricky business regarding patents
2005-06-27T06:50:00.000Z	Seveas	Danar	wrong impression :)
2005-06-27T07:06:00.000Z	Seveas	Danar	it's NOTABUG, it's due to using unofficial repositories...
2005-06-27T07:06:00.000Z	Danar	Seveas	woops. missed that
2005-06-28T11:32:00.000Z	Seveas	Danar	lsuactiafner it's hopeless, he does not listen, i've been trying to help him yesterday but to no avail because he did not listen...
2005-06-28T11:32:00.000Z	Danar	Seveas	i've installd planeshift before...
2005-12-16T17:08:00.000Z	Danar	Seveas	uh, how's 1.5 unstable?
2005-12-16T17:09:00.000Z	Seveas	Danar	quite a few bugs already
