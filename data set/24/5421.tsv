2006-07-21T07:18:00.000Z	mvillaronga		*shrug* never tried something like it before, have done it with /home
2006-07-21T07:18:00.000Z	mvillaronga		the thoery seemed sound but Im still pretty new to all this
2006-07-21T07:19:00.000Z	mvillaronga		I have a seperate / /boot /home partitions
2006-07-21T07:19:00.000Z	mvillaronga		I wnat to move /home to my new big drive
2006-07-21T07:20:00.000Z	mvillaronga		and then recoombine the / and /home on the old one and move root back to it
2006-07-21T07:20:00.000Z	mvillaronga		I may have read the post, I did a bit of digging on the formuns and google
2006-07-21T07:21:00.000Z	mvillaronga		but all the talk was about /home and not /root
2006-07-21T07:21:00.000Z	mvillaronga		I'll go peek
2006-07-21T07:21:00.000Z	mvillaronga		research was earlier, the driver just came intoday :)
2006-07-21T07:22:00.000Z	mvillaronga		I have one, have several actually
2006-07-21T07:22:00.000Z	micahcowan	mvillaronga	I'm not sure I understand why you need to move root back and forth?
2006-07-21T07:22:00.000Z	mvillaronga		I want to repartition the drive that it is one
2006-07-21T07:22:00.000Z	mvillaronga		no more space on its partition
2006-07-21T07:23:00.000Z	mvillaronga	rayston	 which sub forom?  Adminsitration?
2006-07-21T07:23:00.000Z	micahcowan	mvillaronga	yeah, but, why would you need space on its partition if you're moving home /away/ from it, to a different drive?
2006-07-21T07:24:00.000Z	mvillaronga		I have one drive that has 4 partitions /boot, swap. /, and /home
2006-07-21T07:24:00.000Z	mvillaronga		I can move /home out to the new drive
2006-07-21T07:25:00.000Z	mvillaronga		I would like expand the / partition
2006-07-21T07:25:00.000Z	micahcowan	mvillaronga	Ah! After you've removed /home. I see...
2006-07-21T07:25:00.000Z	mvillaronga		or does what I wnat to do not make sense?
2006-07-21T07:26:00.000Z	mvillaronga	rayston	thanks
2006-07-21T07:26:00.000Z	micahcowan	mvillaronga	I don't suppose / and /home are consecutive partitions, are they?
2006-07-21T07:28:00.000Z	mvillaronga		the / is the last drive in a logical partition and /home is immediately outside the logical partion
2006-07-21T07:29:00.000Z	micahcowan	mvillaronga	okay. Are you planning to completely redo the partitions on that system, then?
