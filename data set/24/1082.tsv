2010-09-10T01:03:00.000Z	apparle		hey guys.
2010-09-10T01:03:00.000Z	apparle		Is there anyway I can see the contents of 4 folders on different drives in the same directory?
2010-09-10T01:04:00.000Z	apparle		is there anything like linking or mounting etc for that
2010-09-10T01:04:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	apparle	as in "merge" them or just link their names to some directory?
2010-09-10T01:05:00.000Z	apparle	ilovefairuz	actually I have movies in 4 partitions of my drive. I just want to see them together, its boring to search in each one
2010-09-10T01:06:00.000Z	apparle	ilovefairuz	I want to keep the folders as they are actually. I just want to see them in the same drive
2010-09-10T01:06:00.000Z	apparle	ilovefairuz	sorry ...... same directory
2010-09-10T01:07:00.000Z	apparle	ilovefairuz	any ideas?
2010-09-10T01:11:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	apparle	some ideas in there http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=755808
2010-09-10T01:17:00.000Z	apparle	ilovefairuz	you missed the point. I don't want to merge directories. I sort of want to mount 4 folders in the same directory
2010-09-10T01:20:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	apparle	not possible
2010-09-10T01:20:00.000Z	apparle	ilovefairuz	just for read only purpose?
2010-09-10T01:21:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	apparle	for any purpose
2010-09-10T01:21:00.000Z	apparle	ilovefairuz	:( anyways thanks
2010-09-10T01:30:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	apparle	google unionfs and aufs
2010-09-10T01:31:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	apparle	there's a FUSE implementation for UnionFS called 'unionfs-fuse' that doesn't require support from the kernel
2010-09-10T01:32:00.000Z	apparle	ilovefairuz	interesting thanks.... I'll look into it
2010-09-10T01:32:00.000Z	apparle	ilovefairuz	I must say this could be the perfect solution :D
2010-09-10T01:37:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	apparle	sorry i got disconnected, did you get my messages about unionfs and aufs?
2010-09-10T01:37:00.000Z	apparle	ilovefairuz	I just said, "interesting... if it works out, it could be the perfect solution for me thatnks"
2010-09-10T01:49:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	apparle	install unionfs-fuse and check http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/lucid/en/man8/unionfs-fuse.8.html#toptoc5
2010-09-10T01:49:00.000Z	apparle	ilovefairuz	Thanks, but right now I am not exactly free to experiment with fs. will give it a shot tomorrow
2010-09-10T01:50:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	apparle	it's a VIRTUAL filesystem, will not modify any partitions
2010-09-10T01:50:00.000Z	apparle	ilovefairuz	still I am not free.... :(
