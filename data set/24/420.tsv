2011-09-22T06:39:00.000Z	Superdave_		having trouble with ssh server. I get a connection refused error when accessing from outside, but i'm fine inside. Port is forwarded, and everything seems to be in order. any ideas?
2011-09-22T06:39:00.000Z	rypervenche	Superdave_	Have you checked your sshd_config file?
2011-09-22T06:41:00.000Z	Superdave_	rypervenche	I have, and there's nothing there that seems out of the ordinary... What should I look for?
2011-09-22T06:41:00.000Z	rypervenche	Superdave_	Do you have PasswordAuthentication on?
2011-09-22T06:41:00.000Z	rypervenche	Superdave_	Or are you only using keys?
2011-09-22T06:42:00.000Z	Superdave_	rypervenche	no, I use a password
2011-09-22T06:42:00.000Z	rypervenche	Superdave_	Is PasswordAuthentication set to yes?
2011-09-22T06:43:00.000Z	rypervenche	Superdave_	Still sounds like a port forwarding issue if you can do it on your local network.
2011-09-22T06:43:00.000Z	Superdave_	rypervenche	Yeah, but it's forwarded in my router...
2011-09-22T06:44:00.000Z	rypervenche	Superdave_	pastebin your sshd_config pleaes
2011-09-22T06:45:00.000Z	Superdave_	rypervenche	ok. how do I pastebin
2011-09-22T06:46:00.000Z	rypervenche	Superdave_	pastebin.com
2011-09-22T06:48:00.000Z	Superdave_	rypervenche	http://pastebin.com/EHhsfPLN
2011-09-22T06:49:00.000Z	rypervenche	Superdave_	comment out the ListenAddress
2011-09-22T06:50:00.000Z	rypervenche	Superdave_	Then "sudo /etc/init.d/ssh restart"
2011-09-22T06:51:00.000Z	rypervenche	Superdave_	So yeah, run "sudo service ssh restart"
2011-09-22T06:52:00.000Z	Superdave_	rypervenche	ok. how the freak do I get vim to edit.
2011-09-22T06:57:00.000Z	Superdave_	rypervenche	Got the service restarted, but still getting the connection refused error
2011-09-22T06:57:00.000Z	rypervenche	Superdave_	You sure you changed it? You did "sudo nano" or "sudo gedit" ?
2011-09-22T06:58:00.000Z	rypervenche	Superdave_	What is the command you are doing?
2011-09-22T07:00:00.000Z	Superdave_	rypervenche	"ssh username@publicaddress" (censored, of course)
2011-09-22T07:02:00.000Z	Superdave_	rypervenche	if it helps at all, my goal is to do dynamic tunneling
2011-09-22T07:06:00.000Z	rypervenche	Superdave_	The only things I can think of that would be preventing you from being able to SSH into your system would be your config file and your firewall.
2011-09-22T07:07:00.000Z	Superdave_	rypervenche	is there a system firewall that would be blocking it? because I don't have one anywhere else...
