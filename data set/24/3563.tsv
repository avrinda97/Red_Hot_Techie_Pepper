2008-01-31T18:43:00.000Z	IdleOne		just did a fresh install of 7.04 and my internet is not working or being recognised. need help please
2008-01-31T18:45:00.000Z	sarmisak	IdleOne	what's your nic make and model?
2008-01-31T18:46:00.000Z	IdleOne	sarmisak	SiS Unknown device 0671 is what lspci gives me
2008-01-31T18:46:00.000Z	sarmisak	IdleOne	can you dl a live 7.10 cd?
2008-01-31T18:46:00.000Z	sarmisak	IdleOne	try it with the live cd
2008-01-31T18:47:00.000Z	IdleOne	sarmisak	7.10 has same effect
2008-01-31T18:47:00.000Z	IdleOne	sarmisak	livecd has no internet either
2008-01-31T18:47:00.000Z	sarmisak	IdleOne	hmms, than it's a major problem for you
2008-01-31T18:48:00.000Z	IdleOne	sarmisak	I do have a NIC card that works in my older pc . think I can swap them out without major issues on the driver side of things?
2008-01-31T18:49:00.000Z	sarmisak	IdleOne	that would be a wise choice until a driver is created for your card
2008-01-31T18:49:00.000Z	IdleOne	sarmisak	guess that is what I will do then. thank you
2008-01-31T18:49:00.000Z	sarmisak	IdleOne	never mind.
2008-01-31T18:50:00.000Z	IdleOne	sarmisak	never mind?
2008-01-31T19:18:00.000Z	IdleOne	sarmisak	lspci now lists Realtek Semiconductor Co. RTL-8029 (AS) but still no internet
2008-01-31T19:19:00.000Z	sarmisak	IdleOne	ok, can you check /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules if you can see your nic in there?
2008-01-31T19:21:00.000Z	IdleOne	sarmisak	no such directory
2008-01-31T19:21:00.000Z	sarmisak	IdleOne	nice one... what's your distro?
2008-01-31T19:21:00.000Z	sarmisak	IdleOne	can you check ifconfig?
2008-01-31T19:22:00.000Z	sarmisak	IdleOne	can you see any nics configured such as eth0 eth1?
2008-01-31T19:23:00.000Z	IdleOne	sarmisak	eth0
2008-01-31T19:23:00.000Z	sarmisak	IdleOne	it seems to work then, can you assign an ip to it from your router range by ifconfig eth0 192.168.x.x and ping your router?
2008-01-31T19:25:00.000Z	IdleOne	sarmisak	network unreachable but I may have the gateway wrong
2008-01-31T19:27:00.000Z	sarmisak	IdleOne	hmms, it's strange not to have an internet connection with a realtek chipset nic
2008-01-31T19:27:00.000Z	sarmisak	IdleOne	are you connected to a router or is it just two pcs interconnected?
