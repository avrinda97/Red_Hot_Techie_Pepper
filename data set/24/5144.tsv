2006-10-12T05:45:00.000Z	ArrenLex	blindvirus	is it in your fstab?
2006-10-12T05:46:00.000Z	ArrenLex	blindvirus	what does your /etc/fstab look like? Does it have an entry for that filesystem?
2006-10-12T05:48:00.000Z	ArrenLex	blindvirus	paste the line which is for that parition.
2006-10-12T05:49:00.000Z	ArrenLex	blindvirus	just paste it. It's one line.
2006-10-12T05:50:00.000Z	ArrenLex	blindvirus	paste the line from your /etc/fstab for the slave drive (I'm assuming hdb)
2006-10-12T05:51:00.000Z	ArrenLex	blindvirus	paste it HERE. To me.
2006-10-12T05:52:00.000Z	ArrenLex	blindvirus	*PASTEBIN* the output of "sudo fdisk -l"
2006-10-12T05:54:00.000Z	ArrenLex	blindvirus	at the command line, type "sudo fdisk -l". This will give you a list of your drives. Copy this list. Go to go to http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org. There, paste this list. It will then upload what you just pasted to the internets and return a link where it may be found. Paste this link to me here.
2006-10-12T05:57:00.000Z	ArrenLex	blindvirus	wrong thing. That's your fstab. I want something else now. Paste the output of the "sudo fdisk -l" command.
2006-10-12T05:58:00.000Z	blindvirus	ArrenLex	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/26383/
2006-10-12T05:59:00.000Z	ArrenLex	blindvirus	did you use the -l switch?
2006-10-12T06:00:00.000Z	blindvirus	ArrenLex	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/26384/   there im sorry bout that last one
2006-10-12T06:00:00.000Z	ArrenLex	blindvirus	and where do you want to mount this partition?
2006-10-12T06:01:00.000Z	ArrenLex	blindvirus	yes. Typically, in Linux, they ....GAH. PLEASE watch your typing. Can you translate that to english?!
2006-10-12T06:01:00.000Z	ArrenLex	blindvirus	on Linux, typically drives\partitions are mounted into your filesystem to be used.
2006-10-12T06:03:00.000Z	ArrenLex	blindvirus	you won't be able to write to it. But you can read from it. Does that satisfy you?
2006-10-12T06:03:00.000Z	ArrenLex	blindvirus	pick a folder in your filesystem where all these files will magically appear. You can create a new wone if you want.
2006-10-12T06:04:00.000Z	ArrenLex	blindvirus	are you aware of how partitions work with Linux?
2006-10-12T06:06:00.000Z	ArrenLex	blindvirus	sure, follow the link if you want. Essentially all I'm trying to achieve is the "manual" part of that guide. Do whatever suits you.
