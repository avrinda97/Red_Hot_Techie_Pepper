2011-05-01T20:37:00.000Z	naveed	Froq	and why people use it?
2011-05-01T20:37:00.000Z	Froq	naveed	oo got ya!  it is available for you to get help on anything quickly.  You can often log onto here to discuss your problem.  IRC is rooted in that in the beginning of ubuntu days, a lot of collaboration occurred in IRC channels, though that is not as necessary anymore with GIT, etc.
2011-05-01T20:38:00.000Z	Froq	naveed	I appreciate IRC because it is a chat room that is specific to a topic, and I can get deeper into the community quicker.  I learn so much by reading about a persons questions, and then watching what other members respond with (how they help)
