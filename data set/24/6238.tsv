2005-12-02T10:58:00.000Z	adonikam	sdakota	when installed, it is here /usr/share/doc/apache2/examples/apache2.conf.gz
2005-12-02T10:58:00.000Z	sdakota	adonikam	Thanks!
2005-12-02T13:06:00.000Z	adonikam	sdakota	ln -s /etc/apache2/mods-available/php4.{conf,load} /etc/apache2/mods-enabled
2005-12-02T13:06:00.000Z	sdakota	adonikam	the files aren't there too
2005-12-02T13:08:00.000Z	adonikam	sdakota	are all the others there, excluding php?
2005-12-02T13:29:00.000Z	sdakota	adonikam	Back, No, the folder is empty.
2005-12-02T13:48:00.000Z	adonikam	sdakota	then the packages are broken. use debian ones ;)
2005-12-02T13:49:00.000Z	sdakota	adonikam	well, at uninstalling VHCS, these files probably were deleted - i had them before :/
2005-12-02T13:57:00.000Z	adonikam	sdakota	what server did you get the package from, and what are the installed files according to synaptic?
2005-12-02T13:58:00.000Z	sdakota	adonikam	I'm using apt-get and I don't know what package they came from, they just were there I guess (some package installed at setup)
2005-12-02T13:59:00.000Z	sdakota	adonikam	though, apt-file tells me I need to reinstall libapache2-mod-php4, but then I need to reinstall whole PHP and I did that lots of times before .
2005-12-02T13:59:00.000Z	adonikam	sdakota	then do "apt-cache show libapache2-mod-php4"
2005-12-02T14:00:00.000Z	adonikam	sdakota	you could try php5 instead.
2005-12-02T14:00:00.000Z	sdakota	adonikam	no, because this program wants me to have PHP4... :(
2005-12-02T14:00:00.000Z	adonikam	sdakota	oh I see
2005-12-02T14:00:00.000Z	sdakota	adonikam	otherwise I'd been switched at the beginning of this day already .
2005-12-02T14:00:00.000Z	sdakota	adonikam	look at this output of remove :
2005-12-02T14:02:00.000Z	adonikam	sdakota	It may be a bug in the package installation scripts that come with the package
2005-12-02T14:03:00.000Z	sdakota	adonikam	so how do I get the files now !! ... .
2005-12-02T14:04:00.000Z	adonikam	sdakota	you could manually download the package from a server and run dpkg -x libapache2-mod-php4 ./
2005-12-02T14:05:00.000Z	adonikam	sdakota	but it will of course only work if everything else works ;)
2005-12-02T14:07:00.000Z	sdakota	adonikam	That worked!! I HAVE GOT THE FILES FINALLY !!! =D=D=D
2005-12-02T14:07:00.000Z	adonikam	sdakota	cool!
2005-12-02T14:07:00.000Z	adonikam	sdakota	now see if it works...
