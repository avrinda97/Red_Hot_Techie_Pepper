2005-04-10T12:19:00.000Z	noobuntu		or at all
2005-04-10T12:20:00.000Z	noobuntu		select a subset of packages that they'll support, fix up debian where it's lacking, provide certifications, common marketing materials - basically it provides the infrastructure that assures a prospective linux customer that there will be multiple-ISV support for userlinux
2005-04-10T12:21:00.000Z	noobuntu		but what's holding them up now is the debian release cycle  :-)
2005-04-10T12:21:00.000Z	noobuntu		so ubuntu looks like an interesting solution
2005-04-10T12:22:00.000Z	noobuntu		i'm pretty sure that userlinux intends to remain completely free
2005-04-10T12:22:00.000Z	noobuntu		er, Free
2005-04-10T12:23:00.000Z	noobuntu		not "FREE WHILE SUPPLIES LAST!!!" free
2005-04-10T12:23:00.000Z	noobuntu		it's the exclamation points
2005-04-10T12:24:00.000Z	noobuntu		although !Free == not Free
2005-04-10T12:26:00.000Z	noobuntu		windows is like a bad dream fading into my past
2005-04-10T12:26:00.000Z	Roey	noobuntu	 :)
2005-04-10T12:26:00.000Z	Roey	noobuntu	 lucky for you, you don't have to administer this crap
2005-04-10T12:27:00.000Z	noobuntu	Roey	i have a couple servers to administer but they're dedicated application boxes, and a legacy ms-sql server box that i'm in the process of migrating to postgresql
2005-04-10T12:28:00.000Z	Roey	noobuntu	 luck you :)
2005-04-10T12:28:00.000Z	Roey	noobuntu	 we have all these MS infested POSes
2005-04-10T12:28:00.000Z	Roey	noobuntu	 for some reason the boss decided he wants *only* SMS and *only* MS CRM
2005-04-10T12:29:00.000Z	Roey	noobuntu	 I mean, it's bad enough we were instructed to use w2k3 for file sharing.
2005-04-10T12:29:00.000Z	noobuntu	Roey	we're getting merged with our parent organization and they're heavy microsoft - i'm thinking of looking for another job if i have to go back to windows-land
2005-04-10T12:29:00.000Z	Roey	noobuntu	 look at it as a learning experience
2005-04-10T12:30:00.000Z	Roey	noobuntu	 you'll be more marketable
2005-04-10T12:30:00.000Z	noobuntu	Roey	what do you mean?
2005-04-10T12:30:00.000Z	Roey	noobuntu	 "with windows skills you open yourself up to a huge part of the market for windows admins"
2005-04-10T12:30:00.000Z	Roey	noobuntu	 that's what my boss told me
2005-04-10T12:32:00.000Z	Roey	noobuntu	 me too.
