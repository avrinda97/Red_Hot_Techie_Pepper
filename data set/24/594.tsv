2012-09-15T18:26:00.000Z	jrib	prashant_123456	if you know regex, the "rename" command will be your friend.  See « man rename » for some basic usage and examples.  Also note you should test what your command will do by running it with "-n" (it will do a dry run and only tell you what would happen if you omit the -n)
2012-09-15T18:26:00.000Z	prashant_123456	jrib	can u tell me how to do it

2012-09-15T18:27:00.000Z	jrib	prashant_123456	well... do you know regex?

2012-09-15T18:27:00.000Z	jrib	prashant_123456	do you want to learn?
2012-09-15T18:28:00.000Z	prashant_123456	jrib	yes
2012-09-15T18:28:00.000Z	prashant_123456	jrib	please
2012-09-15T18:28:00.000Z	jrib	prashant_123456	ok.  Are you in a terminal with the files you want to rename?
2012-09-15T18:28:00.000Z	jrib	prashant_123456	ok.  Are you in a terminal IN THE DIRECTORY* with the files you want to rename?
2012-09-15T18:28:00.000Z	prashant_123456	jrib	yes
2012-09-15T18:28:00.000Z	prashant_123456	jrib	yes
2012-09-15T18:30:00.000Z	prashant_123456	jrib	yes i m in my directory
2012-09-15T18:31:00.000Z	jrib	prashant_123456	alright, well the basic syntax for rename is « rename -n 's/foo/bar/' file1 file2 ... » where "foo" is what you want to replace and "bar" is what you want to replace it with.  Now "foo" is a regular expression which is basically like globbing in the terminal but more powerful.  One example, is you can use character classes to mean "any character of this type".  So for example, "[0-9]" means
2012-09-15T18:31:00.000Z	jrib	prashant_123456	let me know when you are done with that and if you have any questions
2012-09-15T18:32:00.000Z	prashant_123456	jrib	 wait please
2012-09-15T18:32:00.000Z	jrib	prashant_123456	sure
2012-09-15T18:34:00.000Z	prashant_123456	jrib	yes now i get what is foo and what is bar
2012-09-15T18:35:00.000Z	prashant_123456	jrib	yes and also i have to remove first 2 characters
2012-09-15T18:37:00.000Z	jrib	prashant_123456	cool.  So you see in its current state 's/[0-9]/X' replaces one digit with X.  We want to change that a bit.  First off we want to make sure the digit is at the beginning of the file name.  The '^' character is used to denote the beginning.  The other thing we want to do is match not just one digit, but exactly two.  We could do this by writing our expression as '^[0-9][0-9]', but there's a
2012-09-15T18:38:00.000Z	jrib	prashant_123456	check and see if that looks right
2012-09-15T18:46:00.000Z	prashant_123456	jrib	yes thanks
2012-09-16T12:11:00.000Z	prashant_123456	jrib	got it correctly thanks
