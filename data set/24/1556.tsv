2011-03-06T07:11:00.000Z	bilal		can anyboy tell me how to enable visual effects
2011-03-06T07:12:00.000Z	bilal		but i cannot work
2011-03-06T07:13:00.000Z	bilal		edbain, i have dell optiplex gx260 with intel 82845 vga card
2011-03-06T07:13:00.000Z	soreau	bilal	Run 'compiz --replace & disown' from your terminal and pastebin the output to ubuntu.pastebin.com
2011-03-06T07:14:00.000Z	soreau	bilal	There's nothing you can do because the driver is too poor for that chipset to run compiz
2011-03-06T07:14:00.000Z	soreau	bilal	If you want to try anyway, you can build compiz yourself to bypass the checks
2011-03-06T07:15:00.000Z	soreau	bilal	They hard coded the check into the compiz binary so you have to build compiz yourself
2011-03-06T07:17:00.000Z	soreau	bilal	Run this: sudo apt-get install git-core && git clone git://anongit.compiz.org/users/soreau/scripts && cd scripts && ./build_compiz++
2011-03-06T07:18:00.000Z	soreau	bilal	After that command completes, it will prompt you to run ccsm and which plugins you have to enable and how to start compiz++
2011-03-06T08:40:00.000Z	bilal	soreau	it didnot work for me
2011-03-06T08:40:00.000Z	soreau	bilal	What happened?
2011-03-06T08:40:00.000Z	bilal	soreau	the command has completed
2011-03-06T08:40:00.000Z	soreau	bilal	Oh you're the one with intel blacklisted gpu?
2011-03-06T08:41:00.000Z	bilal	soreau	i have change settings in ccsm but nothing is happen
2011-03-06T08:41:00.000Z	soreau	bilal	You have to actually start compiz by running /opt/compiz++/bin/compiz++
2011-03-06T08:42:00.000Z	soreau	bilal	Make sure window decoration and move window are enabled along with composite and opengl plugins, then try to start compiz and see what happens
2011-03-06T08:43:00.000Z	soreau	bilal	With Alt+Drag?
2011-03-06T08:43:00.000Z	soreau	bilal	Run 'metacity --replace' to get the default wm back
2011-03-06T08:45:00.000Z	soreau	bilal	If you have window decoration enabled and starting compiz leaves you without borders, it likely means that it failed to start. Do you get any output from your terminal? If so, pastebin it to ubuntu.pastebin.com
2011-03-06T08:48:00.000Z	soreau	bilal	The default compiz 0.8 should still work just as before
2011-03-06T08:48:00.000Z	soreau	bilal	'compiz --replace' should get you compiz 0.8 and ccsm should be ccsm 0.8 (just close ccsm 0.9 first)
2011-03-06T08:51:00.000Z	bilal	soreau	is there other way to unblacklist intel 845
2011-03-06T08:53:00.000Z	soreau	bilal	As I explained before, your gpu is blacklisted for the reason that the intel driver no longer supports this card well enough to run compiz
2011-03-06T08:53:00.000Z	soreau	bilal	If you would like, you can try booting with 'i915.modeset=0' as a kernel parameter to use the older intel driver
