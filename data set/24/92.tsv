2012-08-01T09:20:00.000Z	lotuspsychje	caixa	got precise 64 bit here, boots in 5sec (autologin)
2012-08-01T09:20:00.000Z	lotuspsychje	caixa	and still got an old ssd lol
2012-08-01T09:21:00.000Z	lotuspsychje	caixa	if you buy a 6G ssd and put ubuntu64 on it , will go like rocket
2012-08-01T09:21:00.000Z	lotuspsychje	caixa	try ##hardware for fastest ssd atm
2012-08-08T10:52:00.000Z	caixa	lotuspsychje	you sure?  they have 12.04 on their website
2012-08-08T10:52:00.000Z	caixa	lotuspsychje	just came across it and was wondering if anyone had any experience with it
2012-08-08T10:53:00.000Z	lotuspsychje	caixa	cool never heard of that project b4
2012-08-08T10:54:00.000Z	lotuspsychje	caixa	ive just tested netbook remix, not the mini
2012-08-08T10:54:00.000Z	caixa	lotuspsychje	yes, seems pretty cool, it essentially is like archlinux, but ubuntu based... comes with bare bones and lets you add what you need
2012-08-08T10:54:00.000Z	lotuspsychje	caixa	you can finetune regular ubuntu to your wishes aswell of course
2012-08-08T10:55:00.000Z	caixa	lotuspsychje	yes but the standard iso comes with a bunch of software/services that most dont need
2012-08-08T10:55:00.000Z	caixa	lotuspsychje	mini remix is like 133mb iso
2012-08-08T10:56:00.000Z	caixa	lotuspsychje	oops, 180mb
2012-08-08T10:57:00.000Z	lotuspsychje	caixa	i think there are packages within ubuntu too for building own boot iso
2012-08-08T10:57:00.000Z	caixa	lotuspsychje	yes i think you use them to customize the 180mb iso to add what you need
2012-08-08T10:57:00.000Z	caixa	lotuspsychje	apps like ubuntu customization kit
2012-08-08T10:58:00.000Z	caixa	lotuspsychje	cool
2012-08-08T10:59:00.000Z	lotuspsychje	caixa	you gotta love proffessional packages to make ubuntu life easy right
2012-08-08T10:59:00.000Z	caixa	lotuspsychje	yeah i think ubuntu is packaged with so much by default to just make everything easier and not having to have users go searching for things
2012-08-08T11:00:00.000Z	caixa	lotuspsychje	the most popular distros are always the easiest ones that come with the less work
2012-08-08T11:01:00.000Z	caixa	lotuspsychje	pff, which all the linux distros out there, there is something for everyone
